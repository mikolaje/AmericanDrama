我们塔尔萨分公司需要你012---We could use you in Tulsa.
谢谢你试着想出一个不必离别的方法012---Thanks for trying to figure out a way,
但是如果你要去塔尔萨  我会跟你去012---but if you go to Tulsa,I go with you.

什么  哪里  你不舒服吗012---What? Where? You're not feeling well?
你患了什么病  风疹吗012---What do you have? Rubella?
别靠近艾玛  她还没有注射疫苗012---Because don't go near Emma,she has not had that shot.
仔细想想  倒确实有点像是风疹012---You know,come to think of it,it does feel rubellalike.
维纳012---Wiener!
维纳  维纳  维纳012---Wiener! Wiener! Wiener!

好的  没问题  待会见  拜拜012---All right,great. See you. Byebye.
我为什么要说麦克呢012---Why'd I have to say Mike?
我根本不认识叫麦克的012---I don't know a Mike!
我怎么就没说个别的什么名字012---Why couldn't I have said..?
里面根本就没有男生的号码012---There's no guys in there!
要找个好医生真是难012---It's impossible to find a good doctor.
要如何分辨哪个是好医生012---How do you know the good ones..

罗斯昨晚不舒服012---Ross was getting sick last night,
艾玛或许也被感染到了012---and Emma may have caught it.

罗斯说他去世了012---Ross said he died.
他才没去世012---He didn't die.
我上星期才遇到他女儿012---I just saw his daughter last week.

但是她本人  可被肉毒杆菌搞惨了012---Her,on the other hand,botched Botox.
太好了  那我要带艾玛去找他012---Great. Well then,I'm gonna take Emma to see him.
为什么罗斯说他死了呢012---I wonder why Ross said that he died?
或许他把他012---Maybe he was getting him confused
跟他小时候的心理医生搞混了012---with his childhood therapist.
他看过心理医生012---He saw a therapist?
他以前常常做重复的噩梦012---He used to have a recurring nightmare.
吓死他了012---It freaked him out.

真不敢相信  我竟然跟你做这事儿012---I can't believe I'm doing this with you.
我才刚结束一段九年的恋情012---Although I did just end a nineyear relationship..
所以我应该敞开胸怀  迎接一些挑战012---so I should be open to taking some risks.
一切都会没事的  好吗012---Everything is gonna be fine, ok?
按照我的指示就行012---Follow my lead.

我一直想成为专业钢琴家012---I always want to play piano professionally.
如果现在不赶快做  就来不及了012---If I don't do this now,I never will.
太好了  我喜欢音乐家胜过律师012---Great. I like that better than the lawyer thing.
正因此我才一直等到现在012---Which is why I waited until now
才介绍麦克给你012---to introduce you to Mike.
