乔伊012---Joey?
我的天啊012---Oh,my God.
好吧012---Okay.
那么012---So..
我想  我们该正式一点  对吧012---I guess we should make it official,huh?
听着  瑞秋  我012---Look,Rach,I..
嘿  罗斯来了012---Hey,Ross is here!
嘿  瞧我的好朋友罗斯来了012---Hey,look,it's my good friend Ross!
嘿  罗斯  嘿  乔伊012--- Hey,Ross.  Hey,Joey.
嘿  你好 嘿  你好012--- Hey,you.  Hey,you.
他还送花呢012---And he brought flowers!
谢了  罗斯012---Thanks,Ross.
我倒是那种喜欢送糖果的人012---I'm really more of a candy kind of guy.
你今天真诡异012---You're weird today.
听着  我有事想跟你谈012---Listen,I wanted to talk to you about something.
事实上  我也需要跟你谈谈012---Yeah. Actually,I kind of need to talk to you too.
乔伊  你可以回避一下吗 不行012--- Joey,could you give us a minute?  No.
什么  我很抱歉  我是说做不到012--- What?  I'm sorry. I meant,"No."
嘿  瞧瞧谁来了012---Hi. Hey,look who's here.
我的孙女在哪012---Where's my granddaughter?
我一直在练习变魔术012---I've been practicing my magic tricks.
他从我耳后变出一个硬币012---He pulled a quarter out of my ear.
嘿  妈呢  她去接莉蒂阿姨012--- Hey,where's Mom?  She went to pick up Aunt Liddy.
莉蒂阿姨要来012---Aunt Liddy's coming?
那我们又可以得到5块零花钱啦012---That means we get $5 each!
我何时才可以见到艾玛012---So when do I get to meet Emma
然后表演这个给她看012---and show her this:
好耶  哇012---Okay,wow.
艾玛在育婴室012---Emma's in the nursery.
如果你要看她  我现在就带你去012---I'll take you now if you want.
但是我真的想要跟你谈谈012---But I really want to talk to you.
我知道  我也要跟你谈谈012---I know. I still need to talk to you.
但是在你们谈之前  我需要跟你谈谈012---But before you guys do that,I need to talk to you.
还有罗斯  我也要跟你谈谈012---And Ross,I need to talk to you.
那我需要跟你谈谈 谈什么012--- And I need to talk to you.  About what?
看你知不知道他们是要谈什么012---To see if you know what these guys are talking about.
《老友记》  第九季 第1集   无人求婚012---Friends S09E01 The One Where No One Proposes
她真是漂亮012---Isn't she beautiful?
瞧瞧她  我第一个孙子012---Look at her,my first grandchild.
那本算什么012---What about Ben?
本  当然也是012---Well,of course,Ben.
我指的是我的第一个孙女012---I meant my first granddaughter.
你有想过跟瑞秋之间的可能性吗012---Have you thought any more about you and Rachel?
当然012---Yeah
事实上我刚才正准备跟她谈012---actually I was gonna talk to her
结果你们都涌进来了012---when you guys came in the room.
真是太好了012---That's so exciting!
即使我们在  你也可以开口啊012---You could've done that with us there.
是啊  没错  当然  是啊012--- Yeah,right.  Sure. Okay.
你能在我们面前自摸012---You can touch yourself in front of us,
却不能在我们面前跟瑞秋谈  什么012--- but you can't talk to Rachel. What?
我何时在你们面前自摸过012---When have I ever touched myself in front of you guys?
拜托  之前你在客厅睡着时012---Oh,please. Just before,when you were asleep in the lounge.
那些亚美尼亚人都不看电视  反而在看你012---That Armenian family was watching you instead of the TV.
这倒提醒了我012---That reminds me.
我的游戏机还在贺斯梅先生那里012---That Mr. Hazmegian still has my Game Boy.
钱德勒  我可以跟你谈一下吗  当然012--- Chandler,can I talk to you for a second?  Sure.
兄弟  我刚做了一件很恶劣的事012---Dude,I just did something terrible.
是你放的屁吗  我以为是杰克012---That was you? I thought it was Jack.
不  那确实是杰克放的012---No,no. That was Jack.
瑞秋以为我向她求婚012---Rachel thinks I asked her to marry me.
什么  她为什么会那样以为呢012---What? Why does she think that?
因为当时看着确实像那么回事儿012---Because it kind of looked like I did.
再问一次  什么012---Again,what?
好啦  我当时单膝跪在地上012---Okay,I was down on one knee
手中拿着戒指...012---with the ring in my hand..
是个男人都会偶尔那样练习一下的012---As we all are at some point during the day.
那不是我的戒指  是从罗斯的夹克掉出来的012---It wasn't my ring. It fell out of Ross' jacket..
当我蹲下去要把它捡起来时012---and when I knelt down to pick it up,
瑞秋以为我是在求婚012---Rachel thought I was proposing.
罗斯准备了戒指  他要求婚吗012---Ross had a ring? And he was gonna propose?
我想是吧  而你抢在他之前先做了012--- I guess.  And you did it first?
他会痛不欲生的012---This is gonna kill him.
你知道他有多爱向人求婚012---You know how much he loves to propose.
我知道  我知道  真是太糟糕了012---I know. I know. It's awful.
那她说了些什么012---Well,what did she say?
她说"我愿意"012---She said,"Yes."
罗斯知道吗012---Does Ross know?
我的天啊 我该怎么告诉他呢012---Oh,my God. What the hell am I gonna tell him?
或许你根本什么都不用告诉他012---Maybe you don't have to tell him anything.
我喜欢  甚合我意012---I like that. Yeah.
如果你先去跟瑞秋解释清楚012---If you clear things up with Rachel,
罗斯就永远不需要知道了012---Ross never needs to find out.
但你必须赶快行动012---But you have to do it now
别等他发现  然后痛扁你012---before he hears about it and kicks your ass.
好吧  我们别扯得太远012---All right,let's not get carried away.
我想要个小孩012---I want a baby.
亲爱的  我们已经讨论过了012---Honey,we've been over this.
我必须要先转过来才行012---I need to be facing the other way.
来嘛  来嘛  如果我们再做爱012---Come on, come on, If we have sex again,
那我怀孕的机率就会增加一倍012---it'll double our chances of getting pregnant.
更衣室现在似乎仍是空的  我好累012--- I think that closet's still available.  I am so tired.
好啦  但是说好没有前戏哦  没问题012--- Yeah,okay,but no foreplay.  Deal!
爸  你又放屁012---Dad,seriously!
你应该要找医生检查看看了012---You know,you really should see someone about that.
知道了012---Noted.
我要去找瑞秋谈谈012---I wanna go talk to Rachel for a minute.
你自己一个人在这里没问题吧012---Are you gonna be okay alone for a bit?
你在开玩笑吗012---Are you kidding me?
我可以目不转睛地看着她到永远012---I could stay and look at her forever.
事实上012---Actually..
你还好吗012---Are you all right?
我想我刚订婚了 天啊  他真求婚了吗012--- I think I just got engaged.  Oh,my God! He did it?
什么  你知道他要求婚吗012---What? Did you know he was gonna ask me?
开什么玩笑  就是我说服他去做的012---Are you kidding? I'm,like,the one who talked him into it.
我喜欢自诩为老友团里的玩偶操纵大师012---I like to think of myself as the puppet master of the group.
你真认为这是个好主意吗012---And you really think this is a good idea?
我才刚说服了他012---I just talked him into it.
别连你也要我说服才行012---Don't tell me I have to do you too?
操纵师也会累的  拜托  好吧012--- The puppet master gets tired,people.  Okay.
我不知道  总觉得怪怪的012---I don't know. It just doesn't feel right.
为什么  你们简直是天生一对012---Why? You two are so meant to be together.
大家都这么认为012---Everybody thinks so.
真的吗  即使罗斯也那样认为吗012---Really? Even Ross?
特别是罗斯012---Especially Ross.
嘿  菲比 我等一下再来012---Hey,Phoebe. You know what? I'll come back later.
小病房真是拥挤呢012---Kind of a full house here.
我想  我  等一下再来012---I guess I'll just.. I'll come back.
他走了  你的未婚夫012---There he goes. Your fiance.
我想是吧012---I guess so.
不过他会在睡着的时候自摸012---Although he does play with himself in his sleep.
我一点也不惊讶012---I can't say I'm surprised.
爸  你在做什么012---Dad,what are you doing?
有两个人在里面做爱012---There are people in there having sex.
不可能是我  我人站在这里012---It can't be me. I'm standing right here.
想要偷看吗  不要012--- Wanna peek?  No!
别这样012---Come on.
你知道吗  我讨厌妈不在你身边的时候012---You know what? I don't like you without Mom.
走吧012---Come on.
我们不偷看吗012---We're not peeking?
我还是要偷看012---Well,I'm peeking.
我的天啊012---Oh,my God!
你好先生  你认识莫妮卡的012---Hello,sir. You know Monica.
嘿  可以进来吗  当然可以012--- Hey,is it okay to come in?  Of course.
乔伊  瞧这戒指  我...012---Joey,this ring, I..
真是太美了  我好喜欢012---It's beautiful. I love it.
是啊  听着  瑞秋012---Yeah. Look, Rach,
有件事我必须要告诉你012---there's something I gotta tell you.
你准备好要再试喂母乳了吗012---Are you ready to try nursing again?
是啊  嗨  艾玛012---Yeah. Hi,Emma.
你觉得她为什么不吸我的奶呢012---Why do you think she won't take my breast?
没关系的  婴儿需要一点时间适应012---It's all right. It takes babies a while to get it.
不过别担心  她会吸的  好吧012--- But don't worry,it'll happen.  Okay.
来吧  亲爱的  你可以办得到的012---Okay,sweetie,you can do it.
张开嘴巴  然后把它放到嘴里012---Just open up and put it in your mouth.
救命啊  上帝012---Dear Lord.
我很抱歉  亲爱的  你刚想说什么012---I'm sorry,honey,what were you saying?
噢  对  听着  我想...012---Yeah,look,I think that..
瞧  她又转开了012---Look! She's pulling away again.
会不会是我的乳头对她而言太大了呢012---Do you think my nipples are too big for her mouth?
她像是被吓到了012---She looks scared.
她看起来是不是像被吓到了呢012---Doesn't she look scared?
你知道的  我跟她又不是很熟012---You know,I don't really know her.
我们试试看按摩胸部来刺激乳汁分泌012---Why don't we try massaging the breast to stimulate the flow?
好的  你在玩我吗012--- Okay.  Are you kidding me?
真是好沮丧012---This is so frustrating.
她为什么不喜欢我的乳房呢012---Why doesn't she want my breast?
我不知道  或许她发疯了012---I don't know! Maybe she's crazy!
嘿  等一下 嗨012--- Hey,wait up.  Hi.
恭喜了012---Congratulations.
我不想在乔伊面前说出来012---I didn't want to say anything in front of Joey.
因为我不清楚他是否已经知道012---I didn't know if he knew.
知道什么  我们有了个孩子吗012---What? That we had a baby?
我们别太低估他的消息灵通度了012---Now let's give him a little credit.
虽然他之前才吃了一个塑料水果012---Although he did eat a piece of plastic fruit earlier.
不  我是说你跟瑞秋订婚的事012---No,no,that you and Rachel are engaged.
什么  噢  那是秘密吗012--- What?  Oh,it's a secret?
太棒了  我们很久都没有玩秘密游戏了012---Goody. Yes! We haven't done the secret thing in a long time.
菲比  没有什么秘密  好吗012---Phoebe,there is no secret,okay?
我都没有求婚012---I didn't propose.
你在说谎吗012---Are you lying?
是不是又跟上次一样012---Is this like that time
你要骗我们你是医生（博士）012---you tried to convince us you were a doctor?
我的确是博士012---I am a doctor!
算了  我要自己去跟瑞秋谈012---You know what? I'm just gonna go and talk to Rachel myself.
好吧  我也去012---All right. Well,me too.
要不要叫醒她012---Well,should we wake her up?
不  别这样  让她睡012---No. No. Come on,let her sleep.
她真的是累坏了  而且真的是订婚了012--- She's so exhausted.  And so engaged.
我的天  她以为我们订婚了012---Oh,my God. She thinks we're engaged!
为什么  她为什么认为我们订婚了呢012---Why? Why,why would she think we're engaged?
或许是因为你给了她订婚戒指吗012---Perhaps because you gave her an engagement ring?
话说  罗斯  博士应该要是很聪明的012---You know,Ross,doctors are supposed to be smart.
我没有给她那个戒指  你没有吗012--- I didn't give her that ring.  You didn't?
没有   那是谁的戒指呢012--- No!  So whose ring is it?
是我的012---It's mine.
那是订婚戒指吗  是啊012--- Is it an engagement ring?  Yes.
但是你并没有拿给她  没有012--- But you didn't give it to her?  No.
但你本来是要求婚的  不是012--- But you were going to propose?  No!
我可能对这件事没兴趣了012---I might be losing interest in this.
听着  我妈给我那个戒指...012---Look. Look,my mom gave me that ring..
是因为她要我跟瑞秋求婚012---because she wanted me to propose to Rachel.
但是我只想要知道...012---But all I wanted to do was see..
她是否愿意再重新开始012---if she maybe,kind of wanted to start things up again.
不温不火的恋爱感觉真美好012---What beautiful lukewarm sentiment.
听着  我不想要冲动行事012---Look. I didn't want to rush into anything.
似乎她也不想要那样012---It seemed like she didn't want to either.
但我不明白怎么会变成现在的状况012---But I don't understand how any of this happened.
难道是她在我的夹克里找到戒指012---What,did she find the ring in my jacket,
然后就认为我要求婚012---assume I was gonna propose..
便急着戴上戒指  向大家宣布吗012---throw it on and just start telling people?
不  她说你有向她求婚012---No,no. She said you actually proposed to her.
我没有  我没有求婚012---Well,I didn't! I didn't propose!
除非...012---Unless..
我有吗012---Did I?
我已经40个小时没睡觉...012---I haven't slept in 40 hours and..
那听起来的确像是我会做的事012---It does sound like something I would do.
听着  我们不能永远躲在这里012---Look,we can't stay in here forever.
我只是不敢相信我爸看到我们在做爱012---It's just,I still can't believe that my dad saw us having sex.
我的钢琴独奏会他都一次没去过012---He didn't make it to one of my piano recitals,
但他却看到这个012---but this he sees!
没关系的  我们都是大人了012---This is okay. We're all adults here.
没有什么好丢人的012---There's nothing to be ashamed of.
现在  我们把内裤放到口袋里012---Now,let's put our underwear in our pockets
然后大胆走出去012---and walk out the door.
嗨  爸012---Hi,Dad.
我还是可以叫你爸  对吧012---I can still call you that,right?
当然  我永远都是你爸012---Of course. I'll always be your dad.
我只想让你知道012---I just want you to know that
你刚刚目击的行为  并非是为了爽而已012---what you witnessed in there,that wasn't for fun.
不爽吗  为什么  为什么你...012--- It wasn't fun?  Why,why,why would you..?
我只是不想让你认为012---Look,I just don't want you to think..
我们像动物一样  随地交配撒欢012---that we're animals who do it whenever we want.
我没那样想012---Well,I don't think that.
在今天之前  我从未想过你们会做爱012---Before today,I never thought of you two having sex at all.
之前的想法要单纯的多012---It was a simpler time.
事实是  爸  我们正在努力012---The truth is,Dad,we're trying.
什么  是啊  我们正在努力弄大肚子012--- What?  Yeah,we're trying to get pregnant.
我的天啊  真是太好了012---Oh,my God,this is so exciting.
快进去继续"努力"  我来看门012---Well,get back in there! I'll guard the door!
没关系  爸  我们可以等会儿再说012---That's okay,Dad,we can wait until later.
我可不同意 你不是正在排卵吗012---I don't think so. Aren't you ovulating?
爸012---Daddy!
你要把握时机  小公主012---You gotta get at it,princess.
当年你妈跟我试着要怀你的时候012---When your mother and I were trying to conceive you..
只要她在排卵  我们就做012---whenever she was ovulating,bam,we did it!
所以我现在臀部都落下了病根012---That's how I got my bad hip.
真好笑   你们的对话简直012---That's funny. This conversation's
让我的脑袋像被子弹打穿一样012---how I got the bullet hole in my head.
有一次我把膝盖架到洗手台上012---This one time I had my knee on the sink,
而你妈...012---and your mother, she was..
我想我们不需要知道012---I don't think we need to hear
你跟我妈的特殊体位012---the specific positions you and Mom had.
没错  现在的问题是你们的体位012---You're right. This is about your positions.
我刚看到你们在更衣室里012---Now,what I saw in the closet
采用的并非是最佳受孕体位012---is not the optimum position..for conceiving a child.
虽然那感觉可能会很爽012---Although it might feel good.
我现在感觉非常不爽012---I don't feel good right now.
但是快感是很重要的012---But pleasure is important,
而且如果女人达到高潮  受孕会更容易012---and it helps if the woman has an orgasm.
你能完成任务吗  猛男012---You up to the task,sailor?
我需要告诉你一件事012---Oh,I need to tell you something.
现在正是时候012---Well,now's a good time.
我正要去把我的耳朵切掉012---I'm on my way to have my ears cut off.
乔伊要我嫁给他012---Joey asked me to marry him.
什么  乔伊向我求婚012--- What?  Joey proposed to me.
他疯了吗  你才刚生下罗斯的孩子012---Is he crazy? You just had Ross' baby!
我答应了012---Well,I said yes.
什么  你疯了吗012---What,are you crazy?
你才刚生下罗斯的孩子012---You just had Ross' baby!
那太不合适了  不  比那更恶劣012---It's so inappropriate. No,it is worse than that.
简直是有违道德  简直012---It is wrong. It's...
钻戒比我的大多了012---It is bigger than mine!
我知道012---I know.
《我们的日子》 真是太感谢电视了012---Days of our Lives,thank you very much.
你不能嫁给他  为什么不能012--- You can't marry him.  Why not?
我不想要一个人苦撑012---Come on,I don't want to do this alone,
而且他是个好人012---and he's such a sweet guy.
而且他很爱我012---And he loves me so much.
那你爱他吗012---Well,do you love him?
当然012---Sure.
当然  是啊  我是说  随便啦012--- Sure?  Yeah,I mean,whatever.
亲爱的  问题是012---Honey,the question is..
你是真的想嫁给乔伊吗012---do you really want to marry Joey?
不012---No.
不  我不想012---No,I don't.
你能行行好帮我去告诉他吗012---Could you be a dear and go tell him?
你还没告诉瑞秋你当时不是在求婚吗012---You still haven't told Rachel you weren't proposing?
没  她戴上了戒指012---No. She had the ring on..
她看起来很兴奋  然后她露出胸部012---she seemed so excited,and then she took her breast out.
乔伊  你得告诉她真相012---Joey,you have to tell her what's going on.
胸部看起来怎样012---And what did it look like?
我没看到012---I didn't look at it.
大部分都被那死小孩的头给挡住了012---The stupid baby's head was blocking most of it.
马上去跟瑞秋说  别等罗斯发现012---Go and tell Rachel right now,before Ross finds out.
听着  事情没那么简单012---Look,it's not that easy.
她说她想要嫁给我012---She said she wanted to marry me.
我不想伤害她012---I don't want to hurt her.
好啦  反正  就温和地告诉她012---Okay,look,just do it gently.
你说的没错  很有道理012---You're right. You're right.
我得在罗斯知道之前赶快说清楚012---I'll go tell her now before Ross finds out,
而且我会很温和的012---and I'll be gentle.
我办得到的  我是个温和的人012---I can do that. I am a gentle person.
对了  有两个人在里面胡搞012---By the way,two people screwing in there
你可以饱饱眼福012---if you want to check that out.
我听说订婚的事了012---Listen,I heard about the engagement.
惊讶吧012---Surprised?
而且很困惑012---And confused.
瑞秋  亲爱的012---Rach,sweetie..
我没有向你求婚012---I didn't propose to you.
我知道012---I know.
我觉得你并不知道012---I don't think you do.
你没有向我求婚012---You didn't propose to me.
是乔伊向我求婚012---Joey did.
可怜的宝贝  你累坏了012---Poor baby,you're so tired.
瑞秋  我没有向你求婚012---Rach,I didn't propose to you.
乔伊没有向你求婚012---Joey didn't propose to you.
钱德勒也没有向你求婚012---And Chandler didn't propose to you.
你没有向我求婚012---You didn't propose to me.
钱德勒没有向我求婚012---Chandler didn't propose to me.
但是乔伊有012---But Joey did.
乔伊向你求婚012---Joey proposed to you?
我可以等一下再来  等等  等等012--- I can come back.  Wait. Wait. Wait.
乔伊  你有向她求婚吗  没有012--- Joey,did you propose to her?  No.
你有  事实上  严格说来  我没有012--- Yes,you did.  Actually,technically,I didn't.
那你为什么给我戒指呢  等一下012--- Well,then,why did you give me a ring?  Wait.
戒指是你给她的?012---You gave her the ring?
没有  而且我也没向她求婚012---No,and I did not ask her to marry me.
有  你有  不  我没有012--- Yes,you did.  No,I didn't.
你有  我没有012--- Yes,you did.  No,I didn't.
你有  别再说你没有了012---Yes,you did,and don't you say you didn't!
他当时就在床前012---He was right there.
单膝跪地  然后向我求婚012---He got down on one knee and he proposed.
你单膝跪地  是啊  形象全毁012--- You were down on one knee?  Yeah,that looks bad.
但是我并没有求婚012---But  I didn't, I didn't propose.
那到底是怎么回事012---Then what did happen?
是啊  到底是怎么回事012---Yeah,what did happen?
是这样的  当时戒指掉到了地上012---Okay,the ring fell on the floor,
然后我蹲下去捡012---and I went down to pick it up..
然后你就以为我是在求婚012---and you thought I was proposing.
但是你嘴里说着"嫁给我好吗"012---Yeah,but you said,"Will you marry me?"
不  我没说  有  你有012--- No,I didn't.  Yes,you did.
不  我没有012---No,I didn't.
有  你有  噢  天啊  你并没有012---Yes,you did. Oh,my God,you didn't.
你为什么不早点说呢012---Why didn't you tell me that before?
我也想啊  但是一直有人进来打断012---Well,I tried.. but people kept coming in,
然后你又露出胸部012---and then you took your breast out.
你看到她的胸部了012---You saw her breast?
我待会再告诉你  冷静点012---I'll tell you about it later. Be cool.
那乔伊你拿个戒指搞什么012---Then Joey, what the hell were you doing with an engagement ring?
那不是我的戒指  是罗斯的012---It wasn't my ring! It's Ross' ring.
正因此我才觉得好内疚  瑞秋012---That's why I felt so bad, Rach,
因为他本来是打算求婚的012---because he was gonna propose.
什么012---What?!
你本来要向我求婚012---You were gonna propose to me?
没有012---No.
噢  这下尴尬了012---Well,this is awkward.
但是我本来是要问你012---But I was going to see if,you know,
是否愿意跟我重新开始012---maybe you wanted to start dating again.
但  我是说  仅此而已  瑞秋012---But that,I mean,that was all,Rach.
老兄  勇敢点吧  我都求婚了012---Dude,step up. I proposed.

嘿  她刚醒来  而且饿了012---Hey,she just woke up. She's hungry.
我们再来试试看吧012---Why don't we give this another try?
我不敢相信你竟然告诉她我要求婚012---I can't believe you told her I was gonna propose.
我不敢相信你竟然不打算求婚012---I can't believe you're not gonna propose.
嘿  我才不要头脑发热一时冲动呢012---Hey,I am not gonna rush into anything.
是啊  老兄  我完全理解012---Yeah,dude,I totally understand.
在跟一个女人有了小孩之后012---Usually after I have a baby with a woman,

我很抱歉  我搞出来的闹剧012---And I'm sorry about everything.
亲爱的  别担心  是我的错012---Honey,don't worry,it was my mistake.
不  瑞秋  我应该早点告诉你的012---No,Rach,I should've told you sooner.
只不过...012---It's just that..
天啊  那小孩吸得真起劲儿012---Man,that kid is going to town!
她真是完美012---She's perfect.
我们真幸运012---We're so lucky.
我们确实很幸运012---We really are.
听着  我知道那不是求婚012---Look,I know it's not a proposal,
我也不知道你的意思如何012---and I don't know where you are..
但是有了艾玛之后  我...012---but with everything that's been going on and with Emma,I'm..

不好意思  你说什么012---I'm sorry,what?
当你以为乔伊是在求婚012---When you thought Joey proposed..

任何人求婚  我都会答应的012---I would have said yes to anybody.
就像上次你向我求婚一样012---Like that time when you and I got married.
我控制不了自己012---I'm not helping.
你才刚生下我们的小孩  却答应要嫁给他012---So you said yes to him,and you just had our baby?
没错  而且按照习俗012---That is right. And traditionally,
父亲应该要送母亲一个礼物的012---the daddy gives the mommy a present.

他还在气我们两个吗012---Is he still mad at us?
气你多过气我012---Well,you more than me.
他总不能太生我的气012---But he can't stay too mad at me.
我才刚生下他的小孩耶012---I mean,I just had his baby.
太不公平了  我又不会生012---That's not fair. I can't do that.
我不知道他上来时 你应不应该在场012---I'm not sure you should be here when he comes up.
那正是我所担心的012---Say that's what I was afraid of.
我也不认为我该在场012---I didn't think I should be here either.

我尚可以理解你为何没向瑞秋解释012---And I could even understand that you couldn't tell Rachel.
但你为什么没告诉我呢012---But why couldn't you tell me?

你是在说我们要搬去俄克拉荷马州012---Are you trying to tell me we're moving to Oklahoma

什么  事实上  说起来有些好笑012--- What?  It's a funny story,actually.
我在今早的会议上睡着了012---I kind of fell asleep in the meeting this morning.
所以当我说我可以搬到塔尔萨时012---So when I said I'd move to Tulsa,
我根本不知道我在说什么012---I didn't really know what I was saying.
你睡着了012---You fell asleep?
但那是因为我整晚012---But only because I was up all night
为会议担心而失眠012---worried about this meeting.
是不是很好笑呢012---Isn't that funny?
很讽刺  不好笑是吧  好吧012---Irony. Not a fan? All right.

比如  像是罗素012---You know,like Rossell.
或是罗斯托弗012---Or Rosstrophor.
就是罗斯012---Just Ross.
好名字012---It's pretty.

画图可不行012---The drawing is not.
好了  紧急联络人是谁呢012---All right,who do you want as your emergency contact?
瑞秋  我想应该是吧  好的  关系呢012--- Rachel,I guess.  Okay. Relationship?

写室友 少来了012--- Just put roommate.  Come on.
你们比室友还更进一步012---You guys are more than that.
你们要在一起了  不是吗012---You're gonna get together,right?
我不认为我们将要在一起012---I don't think that we are.
但是你们两个注定是要在一起的012---But you two are supposed to be together.
我也这样想过012---Well,I thought so too.
但是她却答应要嫁给你012---But then she said she'd marry you.
别这样  罗斯  那根本没什么012---Come on,Ross,that didn't mean anything.
她当时刚生完孩子012---She'd just had the baby.
很恐惧要独自承担未来的重任012---She was freaked out about doing it alone.
任何人求婚  她都会答应的012---She would have said yes to anybody.
是啊  她也是这样说的012---Yeah,that's what she said.
所以呢012---So?
所以我不想做一个随便的存在012---So I don't want to be just anybody.
其实  现在这样也比较好012---You know what? It's better this way anyway.

会好起来的012---You'll get better.
想想你第一天上班的时候012---Think about your first day at work.
那也不是很简单的事012---That couldn't have been easy,

只要她一哭  我就需要你在这里012---She starts crying,I need you here.
不  不  不012---No,no,no.
很庆幸  你一点都不需要我012---Thankfully,you don't need me at all.
那么  嘿  超级姑姑 下次见啰012---So okay. Hey,super aunt? See you later.
瑞秋  让她坚持6到8个月吧012---Rachel? Let's give it six to eight months.
好的  听着  我要去睡一下012---Okay,so listen,I'm gonna go lay down.

所以012---So..
谢谢你012---Thank you.
我们才刚让她睡着012---We just got her to go to sleep.
所以现在不能大声吼叫咯012---So there can't be any yelling?
没错012---No.
我们要搬去塔尔萨了  什么012--- We're moving to Tulsa.  What?
我我听不到012---I can't.. I can't hear.
嘿  嘿  你去哪了012--- Hey.  Hey. Where have you been?
发生什么事了012---What happened to you?
我跟乔伊打了起来012---I had a little thing with Joey.
如果你认为我伤得很重  你该看看乔伊的伤012---If you think this is bad,you should see him.
不  罗斯  那可不妙012---No,Ross,this is not good.
我们必须谈谈乔伊这件事  请坐下012---We have to talk about this Joey thing. Please sit.
好了  你必须放下乔伊这件事012---All right,you have got to get over this Joey thing.
好吗012---Okay?
我从未真的想要嫁给乔伊  好吗012---I never really wanted to marry Joey,okay?
好的012---Okay.
你知道我真的很想很想要什么吗012---You know what I really,really want?
什么012---What,Rach?
我想要睡觉012---I wanna sleep.
我想吃东西  我想洗澡012---I wanna eat. I wanna take a shower.
我是说  在她醒来之前012---I mean,before she wakes up,
否则我们又有的忙了012---and we gotta do this all over again.
没错 因为我必须告诉你012--- Right.  I mean,because I got news for you.
艾玛  一点都不好带012---Emma: not easy.
正因此我才在你身边012---Well,that's what I'm here for.
你要我去哄她吗  不  真的不用012--- You want me to get that?  No,that's really okay.
莫妮卡 来了  来了  来了012--- Monica?  Got it,got it,got it,got it.
我一直在想这事012---I've been thinking about this.
而且我要告诉你  那不是我的错012---And I gotta tell you,it's not my fault.
那是自然的本能反应012---It's a natural instinct.
你们在说什么012---What are you talking about?
正好  好吧  如果我这样你会怎么做012---Great. Okay,what would you do if I did this?
是什么惊天动地的大消息012---So,what's the big news
要我们马上赶过来012---we rushed all the way over here for?

你要去多久呢012---How long do you have to go for?
他们说有可能会长达一年012---They said it could be up to a year.
一年  那你也要去吗012--- A year?  Well,do you have to go?
我似乎是没有选择  不是吗012---Well,I kind of have to,don't I?
都是因为这该死的婚戒012---Because of this stupid thing.
再也没有比爱妻的支持更棒的东西了012---There's nothing like the support of your loving wife,huh?
等一下  你不能去塔尔萨012---Wait a minute. Wait,you can't go to Tulsa.
也许你忘了012---Maybe you forgot,
但是下星期我们要去看球赛的012---but we have tickets to the Jets game next week!
我很抱歉012---I'm sorry,
但是我想我可能去不了了012---but I don't think I'll be able to make it.
但我们本打算要去看球赛的012---But we were gonna go see the Jets!
你不能走012---You can't go.
你是维系我们老友圈子的灵魂人物012---I mean,you're the glue that holds this group together.
真的吗  不是说你012--- Really?  Not you.
我真不敢相信你们要搬走了012---I can't believe you guys are moving.
我承接他们的公寓 不行012--- I call their apartment!  No!

是什么问题012---What was it?

瑞秋  我告诉过你了012---Rachel, I told you,
不能每次有鸡毛蒜皮的小事都打给他012---you can't call him every time any little thing comes up.

瑞秋  我保证  明天第一件事012---Rach, I promise,first thing tomorrow,

什么  哪里  你不舒服吗012---What? Where? You're not feeling well?
你患了什么病  风疹吗012---What do you have? Rubella?
别靠近艾玛  她还没有注射疫苗012---Because don't go near Emma,she has not had that shot.
仔细想想  倒确实有点像是风疹012---You know,come to think of it,it does feel rubellalike.
维纳012---Wiener!

麦克012---Mike.
麦克  好的  他姓什么呢012---Mike. Okay,what's his last name?
该死  就不能为浪漫保留点神秘感吗012---Damn it! Is there no mystery left in romance anymore?!
那好吧012---All right.
几小时后与你和麦克在餐厅见012---We'll see you and Mike at the restaurant in a couple hours.
好的  没问题  待会见  拜拜012---All right,great. See you. Byebye.

我就知道那家伙有地方不对劲012---I always knew there was something weird about that dude.

"无论如何"意思是像如果他得病012---"What" means,like,if he gets a disease
或者杀了人什么的012---or kills someone.
而不是如果  他把小弟弟放到鲨鱼嘴里012---Not if he gets his jollies to Jaws.
其实  亲爱的  男人是很不一样的012---You know what,honey? Guys are just different.
他们喜欢一些我们无法理解的东西012---They like things that we can't understand.

但是她应该要记得我的012---But she should remember sleeping with me.

你们知道的  我们怎么会知道呢012--- You guys know.  How do we know?
我们又没跟你上过床012---We've never slept with you.
那是谁的错呢012---And whose fault is that?
又没有什么大不了的012---What's the big deal?
你忘了  她忘了012---You forgot,she forgot.
或许那晚你床上表现不佳  嘿012--- Maybe you were having an off night.  Hey!
我的床上表现从不会不佳  好吗012---I never have an off night. Okay?
虽然有时候如果我吃太饱012---Although,sometimes if I'm a little bloated,
可能就不会觉得很性感012---I don't feel that sexy.

亲爱的  你何不就此释怀012---Honey,why don't you just let it go
再约她出去呢012---and ask her out again?
你们都是荡货012---You're both so slutty,
你们根本都不记得跟谁上过床012---you don't remember who you slept with.
你们是天生的一对012---You're made for each other.
真有趣012---Interesting.
好吧  我会再跟她出去012---Well,I'll go out with her again
然后忘了过去012---and I'll try to get past it.
不能吃盐  会胀气012---No salt! Bloaty!
乔伊 干嘛012--- Joey?  What?

你有过六年的恋情012---You had a sixyearlong relationship..
跟一个叫做维克莱的人012---with a guy named Vikram.
什么  为什么012---What? Why?
因为  他好像012---Well,he seemed..
有点惊讶  因为我对他说012---to bum hard when I told him that
你从未谈过认真的恋情012---you'd never been in a serious relationship.

你会感觉好多了012---a little bit about Vikram.
好的  他是012---Okay,he's a..
他是风筝设计师012---He's a kite designer.
而且他曾经跟奥普拉约会过012---And he used to date Oprah.

我会跟他老实说 很好012--- I'm just gonna be honest with him.  Good.
跟他老实说012---Just be honest with him.
我没什么好羞耻的  没错012--- I have nothing to be ashamed of.  No.

都没有超过一个月012---that lasted longer than a month.
那又如何  我是没有过真正的男朋友012---Okay? I haven't had a real boyfriend.
如果他无法接受 那他可以离开012---You know? If he can't handle it,then he can leave.
我想他会离开的012---Which he will.
而这一切都没有关系012---And,you know,that's okay.
我只不过会永远孤单而已012---So I'll just be alone forever.
都没关系了  一切都会没事的012---You know,all right. It'll be fine. It'll be fine.
我就跟寡妇还有同性恋一起出去玩嘛012---I'll go on walking tours with widows and lesbians.

噢  是这样的  我正在排卵012---Well,you see,I'm ovulating.
噢  是啊  她自己那样说罢了012---Oh,yeah,that's what she says.
或许你根本没有在排卵012---Maybe you're not ovulating at all.
或许那只是要拐我上床的借口012---Maybe it's a clever ruse to get me into bed.
是啊  烟虫  就是那样没错012---Yeah,Smokey,that's what it was.
我就是欲求不满012---I just can't get enough.
你们不会相信的012---You're not gonna believe this.
她撒谎  她竟然骗我跟她上床012---She lied, she ttricked me into having sex with her.

你还想再试试看吗012---Do you want to give it another try?
你从没有跟肯尼迪家的人上过床吗012---So,you've never had sex with a Kennedy,have you?

一旦卵子落到输卵管012---Once the egg descends into the fallopian tube..

他问我有没有跟谁交往  而我说没有012---He said,"Are you seeing someone?" and I said,"No."
本来你是可以趁机告诉他的012---Well,that would've been your window.
我也不知道怎么回事  我看着他的双眼012---I mean,I don't know. I was looking in his eyes..
然后只能想012---and I was just thinking,
"我的天  是大卫  大卫回来了"012---"Oh,my God,it's David. David's here."
他真是令人无法抗拒012---He's so irresistible.
不是吧  那个科学家012---Really? The scientist guy?
不是吧  钱德勒012---Really? Chandler?
继续说012---Continue.
然后越来越糟糕012---Then it gets worse..
因为我答应他  明晚跟他见面012---because I told him I would see him tomorrow night.
菲比 我知道  太差劲了012--- Phoebe!  I know! Evil!
我真的好喜欢麦克012---I like Mike so much,you know?
发展得真的很顺利  我的天012---It's just going really well. Oh,my God!
真是讽刺  大卫居然出现在012---Isn't it ironic that David would show up..
你和麦克交换钥匙的同一天012---on the same day that you and Mike exchange keys?
是啊  而且012---Yeah. You know,
我一辈子都在找寻讽刺的事012---and given my lifelong search for irony..
你可以想像我有多开心012---you can imagine how happy I am!
你要怎么办呢  我想我只能012--- What are you gonna do?  I mean,I guess I just have to..
告诉大卫我们之间是不可能的012---tell David that nothing can happen between us.
除非我不告诉他012---Unless I don't.
你知道的  复杂的道德情况012---You know,complicated moral situation?

等到里面再发挥012---Save it for inside.
奥克拉荷马真是疯狂012---So Oklahoma's a crazy place.
他们把那里称为先锋之州012---You know,they call it the Sooner State.
老实说  我宁愿早"先"一点搬到别的州012---Frankly,I'd sooner be in any other state!
而且奥克拉荷马为什么有个平底锅柄呢012---And what's with Oklahoma having a panhandle?
其它的州可以有像那样的东西吗012---Can all states have stuff like that?
嘿  我是从怀俄明州的腰部来的012---Hey,yeah,I'm from the waistband of Wyoming.
但是当我7岁的时候012---But when I was 7,
我们就搬到胯下部了012---we headed over to the crotch.
你坐的机舱是不是压力太大012---Was your cabin pressurized?
而且别让我开口吐槽012---And don't get me started on the way
塔尔萨人说话的方式012---the people from Tulsa talk.
好的012---Okay.
"你全"到底是个什么词呢012---What's with the word "y'all"?
只不过是"你们"跟"全部"加在一起012---You know,just two words just pushed together?
我们可以那样做吗012---Are we all allowed to do that?
因为如果可以  还有很多字可以这样玩012---Because if so,I say why stop there?
你的"新狮子狗" 可以变成你的"新狮"012---You know,your new poodle could be your noodle.

不  只是让我想起012---No,it just reminds me
今天工作时  有个人讲的笑话012---of something this guy did today at work.
我有跟你提过012---I told you about

是啊  你提过012---Yeah,he came up.
他说了一件好笑的事012---Well,he did this bit.
你应该要在现场才感受的到012---You probably had to be there..

我真的可以理解012---I really understand
要把孩子交付给另一个人是很困难的事012---how hard it's gotta be to leave your child with another person.
我是说  那就像把心上的一块肉割下012---I mean,it's like leaving behind a piece of your heart.
桑迪  你说的对极了012---Sandy,that's exactly what it is.
你是同性恋吗012---Are you gay?
没关系  我的工作常引来误会012---It's okay. I get that a lot doing what I do.
但我不是同性恋  事实上我已经订婚012---But I am straight. I'm engaged,actually.
未婚妻名叫狄莉亚  真是好名字012--- Her name's Delia.  That's pretty.
所以你只是一个当保姆的男人012---So you're just,like,a guy who's a nanny.
我知道这对一些人来说是很颠覆传统的012---I realize how it's a bit unorthodox for some people.
但我真的相信012---But I really believe
人一辈子能做的满足感最强的事012---the most satisfying thing you can do with your life..

我说  希望很快再见到你012---I said,"I'll see you soon."
然后他说  "桑卡爹迪"012---And he said to me,"Skadandy?"
那是他给我取的名字012---That was his name for me.
"我每天都会看到你在"012---"I'll see you every day right in.."

因为这实在太奇怪了012---Because it's weird!
为什么012---Why?

真的吗  她真的那样说012---Seriously? She actually said that?
是的  我很愤怒  是不是不对劲012---Yes. Am I crazy to be this upset?

是的  我很抱歉012---Yes. I'm sorry.
我从来没有见过男朋友的父母亲012---I've never met a boyfriend's parents before.
但是  你总该见过人  对吗012---But,I mean,you have met humans before,right?
你何不去找我妈聊聊012---Why don't you go talk to my mom.

一切都是他受了良好的家庭教育012---It's a testament to how he was raised.
尤其是你的功劳012---Especially to you,
因为他十分尊重女性012---because he's very respectful of women.
他真的吗012---Is he really?
开什么玩笑  他非常体贴我的感受012---Are you kidding? He is so considerate of my feelings.
我认为你也会想知道012---You know,I think you'd also like to know
他在床上非常温柔012---that he is a very gentle lover.
什么012---Excuse me?
不  别误会我012---No,don't get me wrong.
不  不是那种娘娘腔的样子012---No, he is not in like a sissy way.
不是  不是  当他疯起来的时候012---No, no, When he gets going..
他可是像休假的船员一样神勇012---he can rattle a headboard like a sailor on leave.
真不愧是  我儿子012---That's.. my boy.
真了不起012---Awesome.
我不会看的  我不需要看012---I'm not gonna watch it. I don't need to watch it.
我是说  看了又有什么好处呢012---I mean,what good could possibly come from watching it?
我们知道我还是要看的012---Well,we know I'm gonna watch it.
嘿  兄弟  怎么了012---Hey,dude,what's up?
别评判我  我只不过是个普通人012---Don't judge me! I'm only human!
你私自偷走了那卷带子吗012---Did you take that tape?
我是不得已  假设你结婚了012---I had to! OK? Imagine you were married
然后你发现一卷你老婆的录影带012---and you found a tape of your wife..
在另一个男人的公寓里012---in another guy's apartment.
你难道不想知道里面是什么吗012---Wouldn't you need to know what was on it?
我不知道  我跟谁结婚呢012---I don't know. Who am I married to?
某个女孩012---Some girl.
她性感吗012---She hot?
她是怎么让我定下来的012---How did she get me to settle down?
好了  我要看012---All right,I'm gonna watch it.
我是说  或许根本不是我想的那样012---I mean,it's probably not even what I think it is.
即使是  或许也不像我现在脑海中012---Even if it is,it can't possibly be
想像的情景那样糟糕012---as bad as what I'm picturing in my head.
会吗012---Can it?
依据我的经验012---Settle on my experience,
如果女生答应可以录下来012---if a girl says yes to being taped..
其他的基本也不会拒绝了  我跟你说012---she doesn't say no to much else,I'll tell you.
那你先帮我看  什么012--- Then you have to watch it for me.  What?
几秒钟就好  让我知道那是什么012---Just for a few seconds so I can know what it is.
拜托012---Please?
好啦  可以012---All right,fine.
但是万一我乐在其中012---But if I enjoy this,
你就只能怪你自己012---you have only yourself to blame!
为什么我听到欢呼声012---Why am I hearing cheering?
没关系  是橄榄球赛012---It's okay. It's just a football game.
橄榄球  只是橄榄球赛吗012---Football? It's just football?
你担心是多余的012---You were all worried for nothing.
是橄榄球赛  只是是橄榄球赛012---It's football! It's just football!
太棒了012---This is great!
这是我第一次真正喜欢橄榄球012---This is the first time I've ever enjoyed football!
我想这时候喝啤酒很对味012---I think it may be customary to get a beer.
搞什么012---What the..?
你在做什么012---What are you doing?
你不想要看到我刚看到的东西012---You don't wanna see what I just saw!
你们在做什么012---What are you guys doing?
噢  我的天  那是理查吗012---Oh,my God! Is that Richard?
好了  给妈咪笑一笑  拜托012---Okay,please laugh for Mommy. Please?
请为妈咪笑一个012---Please laugh for Mommy.
不好笑  对吧012---Not funny,huh?
是不是...012---Well,so is it..
只有低级好玩的饶舌歌才行呢012---only offensive novelty rap?
或许只要是饶舌歌都行012---Or maybe just,you know,rap in general.
因为妈咪会饶舌噢012---Because Mommy can rap.
我的名字叫妈咪012---My name is mommy
我想告诉你012---And I'm here to say
所有的宝宝都012---That all the babies are
我不会饶舌012---I can't rap.
好了  亲爱的012---All right,sweetheart.
那只是因为我太爱你了012---This is only because I love you so much.
而且我知道你不会告诉别人012---And I know that you're not gonna tell anybody.
我喜欢  大屁屁  我无法说谎012---I like big butts and I can not lie
其他的兄弟无法否认012---You other brothers can't deny
一个有着小蛮腰的女孩走进来012---when the girl walks in with an itty bitty waist

你这个漂亮的小怪蛋012---You beautiful little weirdo.
你错过了  她刚刚在笑012---You missed it! She was laughing!
真是不可思议012---It was amazing.
真不可思议012---It was amazing.
那简直是最美妙的声音012---It was the most beautiful,beautiful sound.
我知道  可不是吗012---I know,isn't it?
你做了什么逗她笑012---What'd you do to get her to laugh?
其实  我只不过试了一些东西  不同的012---You know,I just.. A couple of things I tried. Different..
只是唱了一点《痒痒小蜘蛛》012---Just sang a little "The ItsyBitsy Spider."
你唱了《宝贝背后好身材》对不对012---You sang "Baby Got Back," didn't you?
其它的方法都没有用012---Nothing else worked!
我们家女儿就是喜欢屁屁012---That girl is all about the ass!
然后再回到副歌部分012---And then it goes back to the chorus.
然后那就是歌曲的结尾012---And that's the end of the song.
我知道你们没有要我唱012---I realize you hadn't asked to hear it..
但是已经有17分钟没有人说话了012---but no one had spoken in 17 minutes.
菲比创作了许多很棒的歌曲012---Phoebe writes lots of great songs.
你那天晚上唱的歌是什么012---What was that one you sang the other night
大家都很喜欢的那首012---that everybody just loved?
《变态游行》吗012---"Pervert Parade"?
《阴毛颂》吗  停止012--- "Ode to a Pubic Hair"?  Stop.
噢  天啊  这是小牛肉吗012---Oh,God. Is that veal?
妈  我以为我跟你说过012---Mom,I thought I told you,
菲比是素食者012---Phoebe's a vegetarian.
不  没关系  没关系012---No,that's okay. That's okay.
我是说  我是素食者012---I mean,I am a vegetarian..
不过我吃小牛肉 是的  我爱吃小牛肉012---except for veal. Yeah. No. Veal I love.
菲比  你可以不用吃的012---Phoebe,you don't have to eat that.
不不不  事实上012---No, no, no, actually
我喜欢任何小动物肉  小猫咪肉  小鱼012---Any baby animals. Kittens,fish babies.
但是  尤其喜欢小牛肉012---But,you know,especially veal.
这上面还有带一点很棒的肥肉012---You know,and this nice vein of fat running through it.
好吃012---Yummy.
那012---So..
你们觉得如何呢012---what do you think?
所以你从理查的公寓偷了这卷带子012---So you stole that tape from Richard's apartment?
听听  色情片明星竟然在批评我012---Listen to the judgment from the porn star!
那带子本来就不该让012---That tape was never meant to be seen by..
乔伊  我希望可以012---Joey,I would feel more comfortable
私下谈论这件事012---if this conversation were in private.
莫妮卡  听着  我不认为012---Monica,look,I don't think
你我之间存在任何秘密了012---you and I have any secrets anymore.
没到以此事开玩笑的时候吗012---Not ready to joke about it yet?
那好吧  待会见012---Ok, I'll see you later.
你为什么要拿这卷带子呢012---Why in the world would you take this tape?
而且为什么要看呢012---And why would you watch it?
因为我就是这样的人  好吗012---Because that's who I am. Okay?
我相信像理查那样成熟的男人012---I'm sure a man like Richard
可以看这样的带子  而且不会被说教012---could see a tape like that and not be bothered.
那只不过是个黄色小插曲012---It'd just be another saucy anecdote..
让他可以在男性俱乐部里012---for him to share at his men's club
喝着白兰地  摸着胡子  和兄弟们分享012---over brandy and mustaches.
你闹来闹去  就因为你不能长胡子吗012---Is all of this about you not being able to grow a mustache?
此事是跟你和理查有关012---This is about you and Richard.
他明显没有忘记你012---He's clearly not over you.
他保留这带子012---He keeps a tape
是为了在任何想看的时候就看012---so he can look at it whenever he wants.
那不是很可悲吗012---Isn't that sad?
你看不出来这是多可悲的事吗012---Can't you see how pathetic that is?
别吃醋了  你应该为他感到可怜012---Don't be jealous. You should feel bad for him.
是啊  可怜的理查  他012---Yeah,well,poor Richard,he..
我可以长胡子的012---I can grow a mustache.
钱德勒  这不是我们的问题012---Chandler, this is not our problem.
我们拥有彼此  这才是最重要的012---We have each other. That's all that matters.
是啊  但我老想着012---Yeah, but I just keep picturing
你和他在床上滚来滚去012---you rolling around with him,
穿着你的012---with your..
牛仔靴在空中晃来晃去012---cowboy boots in the air.
牛仔靴012---Cowboy boots?
我这辈子从没有穿过牛仔靴012---I've never worn cowboy boots in my whole life.
很好  非常好012---Good,good.
再多放一点  我想看结局是怎样012---Play more because I wanna see how it ends.
那不是我  什么012--- That's not me!  What?
那不是你  美好的生活又再度来临了012---That's not you! Life is good again!
骑上去  牛仔女012---Ride 'em,cowgirl!
那混蛋洗了我的带子录别人012---That bastard taped over me!
那有什么问题吗012---Is that a problem?
真是太侮辱人了012---It's just so insulting.
花钱买新的空白带子嘛  医生012---Spring for a new blank tape,doctor!
我不明白他到底看上她什么了012---I can't imagine what he sees in her.
她真让我怀念起他那嗜药的前妻012---She actually makes me miss that pillpopping exwife of his.
嗨  亲爱的012---Hello,dear.
怎么了012---What's going on?
我们只是随便聊聊012---We were just chitchatting.
你的朋友还好吗  好一点了012--- How's your friend?  A little better.
顺便问下  你知道谁要搬回城里了吗012---By the way, do you know who's moving back into town?

我没有兴趣012---I'm not interested.
拜托  亲爱的  老实说吧012---Please,darling,let's be honest.
你跟她也可以享受水手般的激烈性爱的012---You can have all the sailor fun you want with that one.
但是我们要面对现实  好了  停012--- But let's be real.  All right,stop.
菲比今晚所做的一切012---All Phoebe has done tonight
都是为了要让你们喜欢她012---is try and get you to like her.
或许你们没看出她的意图012---Maybe it hasn't been clear all the time
但是她已经尽力而为了012---but she did her best.
她是跟你们有点不同012---She's a little different than you are.
麦克  一个皮条客吐口水在她嘴里012---Michael,a pimp spit in her mouth.
那又如何  如果我都无所谓了012---So what? If I can get past that,
你们有什么好在意的012---it shouldn't bother you.
你们没必要去喜欢她012---You don't have to like her.
只需要接受我喜欢她的事实就可以012---Just accept the fact that I do.
如果你们无法善待我爱的女人012---If you can't even be civil to the woman I love..
你什么的女人012---The woman you what?

我爱的女人012---The woman I love.
我爱你012---I love you.
不过我第一次对你说这句话012---Just something I probably shouldn't say for the first time,
或许不该当着我父母的面012---in front of my parents..
以及汤姆跟苏的面012---and Tom and Sue.
对了  顺便说一句012---Who are,by the way,
他们是我一生中遇过的最无聊的人012---the most sinfully boring people I've ever met in my life.
我也爱你  真的吗012--- I love you too.  You do?

有人打开咖啡屋的大门012---Somebody opened the door to the coffeehouse..
然后一只浣熊就跑进来012---and a raccoon ran in
直接拿走你的松饼  我说012---and went straight for your muffin. I said:
"嘿  不能吃  那是菲比的"012---"Hey,don't eat that! That's Phoebe's!"
然后他说012---And he said..
他说"乔伊  你说谎技术烂透了"012---He said,"Joey,you stink at lying."
我该怎么办呢012---What am I gonna do?
别担心  我们会想个好谎言的012---Don't worry. We'll come up with a lie.
我会帮你练习的012---I'll help you practice.
太好了  太棒了  谢谢你012---Great. That'd be great. Thank you.
没问题  你错过了什么工作的事012---Sure. What was the work thing?
"到机场接奶奶"  噢  天啊012--- "Pick up Grandma at the airport."  Oh,man!
她真是我的心肝宝贝012---She's precious.
你会不会担心012---Do you ever worry
她会遗传到你整容前的鼻子012---that she's gonna get your real nose?
艾米012---Amy..
是的  我会  我真的担心012---Yes,I do. I really do.
喂012---Hello?
是  等一下 我可以到楼上讲吗012---Yeah,hang on,one sec. Can I take this upstairs?
当然  我们不住在楼上  但是012---Sure. We don't live there,but..
不是吧  只有这几间房间012---Seriously? It's just these rooms?
我以为你是有钱的医生（博士）呢012---I thought you were a doctor.
不  罗斯有博士学位012---Yeah. No,Ross has a Ph.D.
天啊  她简直不可理喻012---God,she is unbelievable.
对啊  博士学位就跟医学学位一样好啊012---I know. I mean,a Ph.D. is just as good as an MD.
是噢  罗斯  对啊012---Sure,Ross,yeah!
如果我在餐厅心脏病发012---If I have a heart attack at a restaurant,
我会希望你带着化石刷站在一边012---I want you there with your fossil brush.
该死的感恩节  怎么了012--- Stupid Thanksgiving.  What?
怎么了  发生什么事012---What? What happened?
我男朋友取消跟我的约会了012---My boyfriend canceled on me.
我好不容易才找到一段真感情012---I mean,I finally find a real relationship.
一个可以跟我共度今天的人012---Someone that I can spend this day with,
然后他老婆竟然回来了012---and then his wife comes back into town!
我发誓  跟已婚男人约会真是不值得012---I swear,it's almost not even worth dating married guys.
别这样说012---Don't say that.
天啊  我本来很期待今天的012---God,I was so looking forward to this.
本来会是很美好的感恩节的012---It was gonna be such a beautiful Thanksgiving.
我们本来要吃寿司的012---We were gonna have sushi.
艾米  别哭012---Amy,don't cry.
罗斯  我可以私下跟你谈谈吗012---Ross,can I talk to you in private?
当然  你想要去楼上或是012---Sure,you wanna go upstairs,or..?
听着  我在想  如果莫妮卡不介意的话012---Look,I was thinking,if it's okay with Monica..
我想邀请艾米跟我们共度感恩节012---I would like to invite Amy to Thanksgiving.
我认为这是个好主意012---You know, I think that's a great idea.
就像清教徒012---It'll be like the Pilgrims
把梅毒带给美国印地安人一样012---bringing the Indians syphilis.
听着  我知道她有点难搞012---Look,I know she's a little tough to take.
但是  她没有其他地方可以去了012---But she has nowhere else to go,
而且她是我妹妹  是艾玛的阿姨012---and she's my sister. She's Emma's aunt.
我希望她们相处融洽012---And I would like them to bond.
好吧  但我不想她们相处太融洽012---Ok, fine. I don't want them bonding too much.
我不要她告诉艾玛说  她需要鼻部整形012---I don't want her telling Emma she needs a nose job.
罗斯  她很可能会需要的012---Ross,she may need one.
我们也只能接受了012---We're just gonna have to make our peace with that!
嘿  大伙儿  这是我妹妹艾米012---Hey,you guys. This is my sister,Amy.
这是钱德  乔伊  菲比012---This is Chandler,Joey,Phoebe,
还有你认识的莫妮卡012---and you know Mon.
噢  我的天012---Oh,my God.
你有演《我们的日子》012---You're on Days of Our Lives!
是的012---Yeah.
哇  他们一定是帮你化很浓的妆012---Wow! They must put a lot of makeup on you.
感恩节快乐012---Happy Thanksgiving.
欢迎  这是你第一次见到艾玛吗012---So welcome. Is this the first time you're seeing Emma?
是的  我想是的012---Yeah,I think so.
很高兴认识你  艾玛012---It's nice to meet you,Emma.
菲比  声音真好玩012--- Phoebe.  That's a funny noise.
菲比  我还需要你帮忙  好的012--- Phoebe? I still need some help here.  Right. Okay.
不止是你说的谎言本身012---So it's not just the lie you tell,
你说的方式也很重要  例如012---but it's the way you tell it. For example..
如果你说谎的时候看着地上012---if you look at the ground when you're talking,
人们就知道你在说谎012---people know you're lying.
我不知道为什么说谎对我如此困难012---I don't know why this is so hard for me.
说谎基本上就跟演戏一样012---Lying is basically just acting..
而我可是演技精湛的演员012---and I am a terrific actor.
你是演技"精湛"的演员012---You are a terrific actor.
嘿  宝宝在哪呢012---Hey. Where's the baby?
我们刚把她抱去睡了012---We just put her down for a nap.
听着  我刚刚在想012---Listen,I was just thinking.
你们知道什么会很棒吗012---You know what would be incredible?
就是如果你们死了012---If you guys died!
谢谢你  艾米012---Thank you,Amy.
不  然后我就可以得到宝宝012---No,no,then I would get the baby.
就像是电影情节一样012---It would be just like a movie.
刚开始我会全无头绪012---At first I wouldn't know what to do with her.
然后时机来临时012---And then I would rise to the occasion.
我会完全改变  然后结婚012---Then I'd get a makeover and get married.
真棒的电影012---That's a great movie!
听着  反正你们也不能阻止我012---Now,listen,not that you guys could stop me or anything..
因为你们已经死了012---because you know,you'd be dead.
但是我想要帮她改名字012---But I was thinking about changing her name.
我就是不大喜欢艾米丽012---I'm just not really a big fan of Emily.
艾玛012---Emma.
艾玛  罗斯在叫你012---Emma? Ross wants you.
菲比012---Phoebe!
她为什么一直发出那种怪声呢012---Why does she keep making that noise?
亲爱的  我不知道要如何告诉你012---Honey,I don't know how to tell you this..
但如果我跟罗斯发生了什么事012---but if something were to happen to Ross or myself..
你不会得到宝宝的012---you wouldn't get the baby.
那  谁会呢012---Well,who would?
我们还没有正式问过他们012---Well,we haven't officially asked them yet..
但我们希望是莫妮卡跟钱德012---but we would want Monica and Chandler.
我不敢相信你们要我们抚养艾玛012---I can't believe you'd want us to raise Emma.
噢  我的天  我真是太感动了012---Oh,my God,I'm so moved.
我不敢相信  等一下  你们死了012---I don't believe this. Hold on a second. You guys die..
然后宝宝不是我的012---and I don't get your baby?
艾米  我们跟莫妮卡跟钱德比较亲近012---Amy,see,we're a lot closer to Monica and Chandler.
我们每天都见面012---We see them every day.
而且老实说  你好像也不太亲近宝宝012---And truthfully,you don't seem connected to the baby.
亲近  亲近什么  她只是一堆肉012---Connected? To what? She's a lump.
我必须跟你们说  这对我意义重大012---You know,guys,I've gotta say this means so much to me.
我是说  你们肯相信我012---I mean,that you would trust me
把孩子托付给我012---with your child.
大家都知道莫妮卡跟我一直试着012---I mean,we all know that Monica and I have been..
想要生小孩012---trying to have a baby of our own.
我也有怀疑过  自己当父亲的能力012---You know,I've had my doubts about my skills as a father,
但是  你们两个012---but.. that you two..
你们两个  这个人吗012--- That you two..  This guy?
真的吗012---Seriously?
好了  晚餐时间到了012---Okay,it's time for dinner.
各位  我们将使用我们的高档瓷器012---Everyone,we're using our fancy china..
它们是很贵的  所以请小心012---and it's very expensive,so please be careful.
好了  再说明一次012---Okay,just to be clear,
不要拿这些盘子开玩笑012---comedy with the plates will not be wellreceived.
为什么我的盘子不如别人的高档012---How come my plate's less fancy than everyone else's?
你不信任我  不让我用你的高档餐盘吗012---Do you not trust me with a fancy plate?
不  亲爱的  那是特别的盘子012---No,honey. That's a special plate.
其实是一个游戏012---See,it's a game.
拿到那盘子的人就是赢家012---Whoever gets that plate wins.
我不敢相信我赢了012---I can't believe I won!
简直就像狠狠扇了我一耳光012---You know,this is such a slap in the face.
我是说  我是你妹妹012---I mean,I'm your sister..
你却把宝宝给这些陌生人  而不给我012---and you would give your baby to these strangers over me.
莫妮卡是罗斯的妹妹012---Monica is Ross' sister.
不  罗斯的妹妹很肥的012---No,Ross' sister was really fat.
那就是我012---That was me.
不  她上学时是个蠢蠢的女生012---No,she was this dorky girl in school
就像小狗一样跟着瑞秋012---who followed Rachel around like a puppy..
艾米  你不能再这样了012---Amy,you've got to stop doing that!
好了  我知道你现在正在经历家庭危机012---Okay,listen,I know you're having a bit of a family crisis..
但你不需要把气出在盘子身上012---but you don't have to take it out on the plates.
其实我认为每个人012---I mean,in fact,I think that everyone..
都应该这样切食物012---should cut their food like this:
瞧见了吗012---Now,see?
像这样  不只可以保护盘子012---This way,you protect the plates..
而且老实说  还挺好玩的012---and let's face it,you have fun.
好吧  那这样呢  如果你们死了012---Okay,how about this? If you guys die..
而且疯狂盘子女士也死了012---and the crazy plate lady dies..
那我可以得到宝宝吗012---then do I get the baby?
不  如果疯狂盘子女012---No,if crazy plate lady..
如果莫妮卡死了012---If Monica dies,
那艾玛就是我的了  对吗012---then I would get Emma. Right?
其实  其实怎样012--- Well,actually..  Actually what?
只是  如果是那样的话012---It's just.. It's just that in that case..
那艾玛就去跟我父母一起生活012---then Emma would go to my parents.
什么  很伤心  对不对012--- What?  Hurts,doesn't it?
我要等谁死了才能得到她012---Who has to die for me to get her?
所以如果莫妮卡不在了012---So if Monica's not around,
我就没有资格抚养艾玛了012---I'm not good enough to raise Emma?
不  我们不是这个意思012---No,that is not what we're saying.
他在说谎  他看了地上012---Yeah,he's lying. He looked down.
我有什么不好的呢  我无法胜任吗012---Well,what's wrong with me? Am I incompetent?
最后活下来的可是我012---Because I managed to survive
弄死你们三个的事故  没有弄死我012---whatever it is that killed the three of you!
你可能有点误会012---You're taking this the wrong way.
我们认为你会是很好的父亲012---We think you are going to be a wonderful parent.
只是你是比较风趣的父亲012---It's just.. You're more the,you know,fun parent.
是的  我们希望艾玛012---Yeah,and we wanna make sure that Emma
也有像莫妮卡这样的人照顾012---also has someone like Monica..
比较有纪律的人012---who's more of a disciplinarian.
比较坚定  严格的人012---Someone who can be firm and strict.
你们对我的感觉不是真的那样吧012---That's not how you see me,is it?
不  你真的很有趣012---No,you're all about the fun.
我或许不是很了解宝宝012---I may not know a lot about babies,
但是你们真的认为我没有能力吗012---but do you really think I'm not capable?
不  你们两个能力相当012---No. You both are equally capable.
只不过你们在一起的时候是最强的012---It's just you're strongest when you're together.
好的  如果我们一起得到艾玛012---Okay. So if we both had Emma,
然后我死了012---and I died..
她也不能拥有她012---she'd have to give her up.
当然  莫妮卡也必须把她让出来012---Sure. Monica would have to give her up.
我说谎说的至少比他好  对吧012---I lie better than that,right?
让我说清楚012---Let me just get this straight.
如果我的两个朋友死了  我得到艾玛012---So my two friends die,I get Emma.
然后我老婆死了  那艾玛012---Then my wife dies. Then Emma,
我生命中剩下的唯一一小块希望012---the one tiny ray of hope left in my life..
也会从我身边被带走012---gets taken away from me?
真是精彩的好电影012---There's your movie.
嘿  你在这里012---Hey,there you are.
你晚餐之后就消失了012---You disappeared after dinner.
有人想念我吗012---Did somebody miss me?
有婴儿需要被无能的父亲抚养长大吗012---Was there a child to raise poorly?
罗斯跟瑞秋根本不知道在瞎说什么012---Ross and Rachel don't know what they're saying.
他们自己也不是多有责任感012---It's not like they're so responsible.
艾玛只不过是一瓶红酒012---Emma is a product of a bottle of merlot
跟一个过期保险套的意外产物012---and a fiveyearold condom.
不  他们是对的012---No,but they're right.
我不是个坚强的父亲  我永远都不会是012---I'm not a strong father figure,and I never will be.
不  这些是要学习的012---No,you learn these things.
你会逐渐学会的012---You grow into it.
是的  但那就不是我了012---Yeah,but it's not who I am.
他们说的一切012---Everything they said
都是我担心有小孩之后  会面对的问题012---is exactly why I was worried about having a kid.
是真的012---And it's true.
而且  大家都知道012---And look,everybody knows it.
我不知道012---I don't know it.
我要跟你生小孩因为012---I wanna have a kid with you because
我认为你会是很棒的父亲012---I think you'll be an amazing dad.
不管是风趣还是有纪律012---At the fun parts and at the hard parts.
那你可以想像我说012---Well,can you picture me saying,
"回房去  你被禁足了"吗012---"Go to your room,you're grounded"?
你可以想像我说"你被禁足了"吗012---Can you hear me say,"You're grounded"?
你上星期才那样对我说过012---You said that to me last week.
是有多难做到012---How hard is it?
我叫你不要穿着鞋子踏在家具上012---"No shoes on the furniture!"
制作人刚刚留言012---The producer from Days left a message
问我为什么没有参加游行012---asking why I wasn't at the parade.
他说大家都对我很不爽012---They said everybody's really pissed off at me.
而且他们都有见到圣诞老人012---And they all got to meet Santa!
没关系  我帮你想了一个完美谎言012---It's okay. I thought of the perfect lie for you.
很简单  很容易记012---It's simple. It's easy to remember,
而且不会引来更多的问题012---and it doesn't invite a lot of questions.
你没有参加游行012---You weren't at the parade
是因为家里出了紧急状况012---because you had a family emergency.
我喜欢耶  耶012---I like that! Yeah!
我没有参加游行012---I wasn't at the parade
是因为家里出了紧急状况012---because I had a family emergency.
发生什么事012---What happened?
我妹的浣熊  不  别提浣熊012--- My sister's raccoon came..  No,nothing with a raccoon!
等等  你们在做什么 摆餐具012--- Wait,what are you doing?  Setting the table.
我们觉得用这些高档餐盘012---We thought it might be nice to use the fancy china
来吃甜点也很不错012---for dessert too.
很不错  或许等一下我们可以012---How nice. Maybe later we can
去拿我的结婚礼服来擤鼻涕012---all go blow our noses on my wedding dress.
嘿  兄弟  你还好吗012---Hey,dude,you okay?
刚刚的事我很抱歉012---Sorry about before.
没关系  你完全是对的012---That's okay. You're totally right.
我根本就不知道如何管教孩子012---I don't know anything about disciplining a child.
但我还是很伤心012---But it did hurt my feelings,
而且我要你知道  如果我死了012---and I want you to know that if I die..
你别想得到乔伊012---you don't get Joey.
如果你还没注意到012---In case you hadn't noticed,
我现在不会跟你说话的012---I'm not talking to you.
真的是  是典型的瑞秋012---You know,this is just.. This is classic Rachel.
对噢  记得在高中的时候012---Oh,yeah,right. Remember in high school
我死了  也没有把婴儿给你吗012---when I died and didn't give you my baby?
这或许是我唯一拥有小孩的机会  瑞秋012---This might be my one chance to have a child,Rachel.
你知道我一直忙于我的事业012---I mean,you know that I have been so busy focusing on my career..
什么事业  我是室内设计师012--- What career?  I'm a decorator.
你装璜了爸的办公室012---You decorate Dad's office
就是设计师了吗012---and now you're a decorator?
好吧  我昨天去了动物园012---Okay,I went to the zoo yesterday,
现在我就是考拉熊了012---now I'm a koala bear.
你为什么不能多支持我一点012---Why can't you ever be supportive?
你要谈支持吗012---You wanna talk supportive?
我在医院生小孩时012---You didn't come and visit me
你可没有来看过我012---when I was in the hospital having the baby!
我在医院做嘴唇整形时012---You didn't come see me in the hospital
你也没有来看我012---when I was getting my lips done!
我第一次有去012---I did the first time.
说老实话   你想知道012---You know what? You wanna know
我什么不把艾米丽给你吗012---why I am not giving Emily to you?
是艾玛  你是站谁那边的012--- Emma.  Whose side are you on?!
我不给你艾玛012---I'm not giving you Emma
是因为你无法扛起012---because you can't handle
照顾小孩子的责任012---the responsibility of a child.
那有多难  你都做得到012---Well,how hard could it be? You do it.
你知道你为什么不想让我得到宝宝吗012---You wanna know why you don't want me to have the baby?
因为你不想看到我快乐012---Because you don't want me to be happy.
你总是在忌妒我012---You have always been jealous of me.
忌妒你什么012---Jealous of what?
忌妒你没有责任感吗  还是你的不成熟012---Of your lack of responsibility? Your immaturity?
你那种完全忽略别人感受的作为吗012---Your total disregard for other people's feelings?
那只是其中几项012---To name a few.
其实  你总是这样012---You know, you've always been like this.
你总是要所有的东西012---You had to have everything,
而我什么都得不到012---and I couldn't have anything.
就像在初中的时候  你抢走我的迪米012---Like in junior high,when you stole Timmy from me.
你知道那伤我有多深吗012---I mean,do you even realize how much that hurt me?
迪米当时是我的男朋友012---Timmy was my boyfriend,
而你跟他偷偷亲热012---and you made out with him!
别这样  那已经是20年前的事了012---Come on,that was 20 years ago.
别老记着012---Get over it.
我不敢相信我今天邀请了你012---I cannot believe that I invited you here today!
是噢  你知道我不敢相信什么吗012---Yeah,well,you know what I cannot believe?
我所谓的姐姐012---That my socalled sister..
有罗夫罗兰七折的折扣优惠012---gets a 30 percent discount from Ralph Lauren,
而我却要付零售价012---and I still have to pay retail?
是五五折012---It's 45.
你个贱人012---You bitch.
你就是认为你很完美012---You just think you're so perfect..
拥有你的新生儿  还有你的小公寓012---with your new baby and your small apartment.
让我告诉你一件事012---Well,let me tell you something.
你的宝宝并不怎么可爱012---Your baby isn't even that cute.
太过分了  艾米  太过分了012---Too far,Amy. Too far.
你收回那句话  不012--- You take that back.  No.
收回那句话012---Take it back!
不  你能怎样呢  强迫我吗012---No. What are you gonna do? Make me?
嘿  我有上健身房012---Hey,man,I work out!
我也有  我有做普拉提012--- So do I.  I do Pilates.
我有做瑜伽  放马过来012--- I do yoga.  Bring it on!
盘子放到箱子里  盘子放到箱子里012---Put the plates in the boxes! Put the plates in the boxes!
你刚刚推了我吗  是的  没错012--- Did you just push me?  Yeah,I think I did.
好了  够了012---All right,that's it.
别管泡泡包装了  没有时间了012---Forget the bubble wrap! There isn't time!
卷发  卷发  卷发012---Frizzy,frizzy,frizzy!
天啊  我们应该阻止她们吗012---Oh my god, Shouldn't we stop this?
你疯了吗012---Are you out of your mind?
我们应该倒一些果冻到她们身上012---Let's throw some JellO on them!
恶心012---Gross!
好了  到此为止012---All right,that is it!
这是我们家 你们不可以有这种行为012---This is our apartment,and you cannot behave this way!
如果你们不能表现得像成人012---If you can't act your age,
你们就不应该在这里012---you shouldn't be here at all.
那些瓷器或许没有012---Those plates may not be
我挑的那些粉红色瓷器好看012---as nice as the pretty pink ones that I picked out..
但是它们对莫妮卡很重要012---but they're important to Monica.
我要你们现在就向她道歉012---And I want you to apologize to her,now.
我很抱歉  莫妮卡  我很抱歉012--- I'm sorry.  Mon,I'm so sorry.
好了  这样好多了012---Okay. That's better.

对不起  对不起012--- Sorry.  Sorry.
对了  刚才那场架真是让人情欲高涨012---By the way,that fight was totally arousing.
老兄  干的好012---Dude,well done.
如果我跟瑞秋还有莫妮卡死了012---If I die and Rachel dies and Monica dies,
你可以照顾艾玛012---you can totally take care of Emma.
是吗  谢谢012---Yeah? Well,thanks.
那  那我可以得到乔伊吗012---So.. So now do I get Joey?
好的  但是你得知道他一天吃五餐012---Okay. But you should know he eats a lot
而且还会塞硬币到鼻孔里012---and shoves pennies up his nose.
你还好吗  莫妮012---Are you okay,Mon?
这种事常发生的012---I mean,these things happen.
只不过是盘子而已012---I mean,it's just a plate.
又不是有人死了012---It's not like somebody died.
没关系的  你可以哀悼的012---It's all right. You can mourn.
谢谢你  这些本来都很漂亮的012---Thank you. It was so beautiful!
我要去乔伊家拿几个派012---I'm gonna go to Joey's and get the pies.
事实上  不是几个派  只剩一个派了012---Actually,not pies. It's just pie.
我不在乎012---I don't care.
天啊  我已经失去骂人的力气了012---Oh,my God,I've lost the will to scold.
听着  艾米012---Look,Amy..
我们有一点012---we got a little..
刚刚有一点失控012---a little outofcontrol over there.
我很抱歉012---And I'm sorry.

如果你真的很在乎012---and if it really means that much to you..
你要把宝宝给我了吗012---So you're gonna give me the baby?

你不会后悔的012---You are not gonna regret this.
她要换尿布了012---She needs changing.

而且是第4位有资格抚养艾玛的人012---and fourth in line to raise Emma.
我马上就来  艾玛012---I'll be right there,Emma!
先让我拿一下我的尿片袋子012---Just let me get my trusty diaper bag here.
老实说  我觉得我将是第一个死的人012---Well,what do you know? I guess I'll be the one who dies first.
莫妮卡知道你打碎她瓷器的事吗012---Does Monica know about you breaking her plates yet?
不知道012---Nope.
全都打破了  是吗  是的012--- Broke them all,huh?  Yep.
你要告诉她吗 不想012--- You gonna tell her?  Nope.
嘿  我要把这些盘子放回去012---Hey. So I'm gonna put the plates back.
我想你是对的012---I think you're right.
我们近期内不应该再用这些盘子了012---We shouldn't use these plates for a long time.
只有女王来的时候才用吗012---Like only if the queen comes?
或许那时候也不该用012---Maybe not even then.
嘿  我办到了012---Hey. I did it.
我告诉我的制作人说012---I told my producer
我家里发生紧急事件012---I had a family emergency.
他完全相信我012---He totally bought it.
谢谢你教我如何说谎  菲比012---Thanks for teaching me how to lie, Phebs
不用客气  下星期教你偷窃012---No problem. Next week,stealing.
再见  盘子012---Bye,plates.
你告诉她你打破所有的盘子了012---You told her you broke all the plates?
什么  盘子发生什么事了吗012---What?! Something happened with the plates?
是啊  一只浣熊跑进来012---Yeah,this raccoon came in..
这只小猫叫手套  这只是费修012---This kitty is Mittens. This one is Fitzhugh.
然后住在猫公寓的小公猫是金吉012---And this little guy in the cat condo is Jinkies.
好多猫噢  裘琳012---That's a lot of cats,Jo Lynn.
你是单身吧012---Single,are you?
钱德勒·宾012---Chandler Bing.
为什么是你自己接电话呢012---How come you're answering your own phone?
你的疯狂助理去哪了012---Where's your crazy assistant?
什么事  乔伊012---What's up,Joe?
有什么事是我们一直想一起做的012---Ok, What have we always wanted to do together?
帮彼此编辫子  然后在海边骑马吗012---Braid each other's hair and ride horseback on the beach?
不不不  你明晚回家时012---No. No. No. When you get home tomorrow night..
你跟我要去看奇才队对尼克斯队球赛012---you and I are gonna be at the WizardsKnicks game,
场边座位012---courtside!
场边座位  我的天啊  是啊012--- Courtside? Oh,my God!  Yeah!
或许迈克尔·乔丹会扑过来抢球012---Maybe Michael Jordan will dive for the ball
然后用他的膝盖撞断我的下巴012---and break my jaw with his knee!
真是太酷了  我来告诉莫妮卡012---That is so cool. I'll let Monica know.
喂  乔伊刚打电话来012--- Hello?  Joey just called.
他帮我买到了012---He's got courtside
明晚尼克斯队比赛的场边座位012---Knicks tickets for him and me tomorrow night.
是吗012---Really?
但是明晚是我唯一012---But tomorrow night's the only night
不用上班的晚上012---I get off from the restaurant.
如果你去看球赛012---If you go to the game,
我们会有一星期没有办法在一起012---we won't have a night together for another week.
但是亲爱的  那是场边座位012---But honey,it's courtside!
啦啦队就在正前012---The cheerleaders will be right in..
这样可不能说服你012---That's not the way to convince you.
我不想要成为那种老婆  老是说012---I don't wanna be one of those wives that says:
"你不能去看球赛  你要陪我"012---"You can't go to the game. You have to spend time with me."
所以如果你自己能够意识到012---So if you could just realize it on your own..
我知道  你说的对012---I know. You're right.
我也想要见到你012---I wanna see you too.
我得要想想怎么告诉乔伊012---I gotta figure out a way to tell Joey.
他是满心期待着012---He's looking forward to this.
告诉他你很久没有见到老婆了012---Tell him you haven't seen your wife in a long time.
告诉他长距离关系012---Tell him that having a longdistance relationship
是很难维系的012---is really difficult.
告诉他我们有限的相处时间012---Tell him that what little time we have together
是很宝贵的012---is precious.
我会想想别的012---I'll think of something.

太有爱了 罗斯跟麦克的第一次约会012---That's so cute. Ross and Mike's first date.
那会不会很尴尬  你们要聊些什么呢012---Will that be awkward? What are you gonna talk about?
我不知道  但是你知道的012---I don't know. But you know,
我们有许多共同点  明白吗012---we have a lot in common,you know?
他会弹钢琴  我在大学弹过电子琴012---He plays piano. I played keyboards in college.
他离过婚  我在那方面也有些经验012---He's been divorced. I have some experience in that area.

果真是女人之夜012---Girl's night out indeed.
我想艾玛今晚可能已经睡了012---So I think Emma is probably down for the night..

菲比告诉我你会弹钢琴  是啊012--- So Phoebe tells me you play piano.  Yeah.
我在大学的时候也会弹电子琴012---You know,I used to play keyboards in college.
你这里有吗012---Do you have one here?
没有012---No.
好吧012---Okay.
你知道的  我离过婚012---You know,I'm divorced.
菲比  菲比说你  你也离过婚012---Phoebe.. Phoebe says you're.. You've been divorced?
是的  是啊012---Yeah,yeah.
很抱歉  我真的不太喜欢谈那事012---Yeah,I'm sorry. I don't really like to talk about it.
没关系  我们可以聊别的012---That's okay. We'll talk about something else.
你是古生物学家  是吗  是啊012--- So you're a paleontologist,right?  Yeah.
我表哥也是古生物学家012---My cousin's a paleontologist.
他跟我可能会有较多话题可以聊012---Well,he and I would probably have a lot to talk about.

嘿  为什么你的门是锁着的012---Hey! How come your door's locked?
等一下  不不不012--- Just a second!  No,no,no!
不能让乔伊看到我在这里012---Joey can't know I'm here.
为什么不能012---Why not?
因为我不知道怎么告诉他012---Because I didn't know how to tell him that
我不能去看尼克斯队的球赛012---I couldn't go to the Knicks game..
所以我跟他说我要留在塔尔萨012---so I told him I had to stay in Tulsa.
所以你跟他说谎012---So you lied to him?
说谎比费口舌解释要好太多了012---It's always better to lie than to have the complicated discussion.
除了跟你之外012---Except with you.
嘿  开门  是怎么回事012---Hey,open the door! What's going on?
你在干么  嗨012--- What are you..?  Hi.
你为什么穿成这样呢012---Why are you dressed like that?

所以我觉得自己可以...012---so I thought I would just,
先  练习一下妩媚的技巧012---you know,practice the art of seduction.

没有  我只是在扮钱德勒说话012---No,I was just doing Chandler's side of the conversation.
你知道的  就像是012---You know,like,
"嗨  我看起来如何"012---"Hi,how do I look?"
"真性感  我还能比现在更性奋吗"012---"Really sexy. Could I be any more turned on?"
明白吗012---You know?
好的  等一下012---Okay. Wait a minute.
为什么有两杯酒呢012---Why are there two glasses of wine out?
因为有一杯是要给你的012---Because one of them is for you!

听着  我不行  是怎么回事012---Look,I can't. What's going on?
我不知道要怎么开口012---I don't know how to tell you this,
但是我觉得莫妮卡有外遇012---but I think Monica's cheating on you!
早就告诉过你  你不应该娶一个012---I told you,you shouldn't have married
比你性感那么多的人012---someone hotter than you!
如果你没有办法回来处理这事012---If you can't deal with this,
那我去处理012---then I'm gonna.
不  我刚听到他的声音了012--- No!  I just heard him!
你现在有听到他的声音吗012---Can you hear him now?
没有  好了  我要进去了012---No. All right,I'm going in.
不  等等  我又听到他了012--- No,wait!  I heard him again!
好了  你就待在那里别动012---All right,just stay there.
我要回家了012---I'm coming home.
很好  等你回来的时候见012---Ok, great, I'll see you when you get here.
我会在门外守着  以免他逃了012---I'll wait out in the hall in case he comes out.
有那个必要吗012---Is that really necessary?
当然  你也会为我这样做的012---Absolutely. You'd do it for me.
不是说你会有机会那样做012---Not that you ever have to,
因为我知道要如何满足我的女人012---because I know how to keep my women satisfied.
披萨不是早就该到了吗012---Shouldn't the pizza be here by now?
我是说  他们说不用30分钟就会到012---I mean,they said 30 minutes or less.

你喜欢这啤酒吗  是的  我喜欢012--- So you like the beer?  I do. I do.
不过  这事实上是窖藏啤酒012---Although,it's actually a lager.
那普通啤酒跟窖藏啤酒有什么不同呢012---What's the difference between beer and lager?
我不知道012---I don't know.
我们可以查一查012---We could look it up.
真是越来越失控了012---Things are about to get wild.
天啊  还记得以前的女生之夜吗012---Oh,God,remember the girls' nights we used to have..
坐在一起讨论你跟罗斯的事吗012---sitting around talking about you and Ross?
噢  天啊  感觉好像是上辈子的事012---Oh,God! It seems like forever ago.
我知道012---I know.
那  你跟罗斯是怎样了呢012---So,what's going on with you and Ross?
噢  我不知道012---Well,I don't know.
我是说  好长时间都无事发生012---I mean,for a long time,nothing.
但是  事实上  就在你来接我之前012---But you know,actually,right before you picked me up..
罗斯跟我有个小小的"火花"012---Ross and I had a little thing.
噢  我的天  我最爱小火花012---Oh,my God! I love things!
发生什么事012---What happened?
他先是告诉我  他喜欢我的样子012---Well,first he told me he liked how I looked.
然后我们来了个小小的012---And then we had a little..
眼神接触012---eye contact.
眼神接触012---Eye contact?
我希望你们有用避孕措施012---I hope you were using protection.
打扰一下012---Excuse me,
这些是吧台最后那两位先生请的012---these are from the two gentlemen at the end of the bar.
我们应该回请他们什么的吗012---Should we send them something back?
我们请他们吃土豆泥好了012---Let's send them mashed potatoes!
不  等等  别那么做012---No,wait! Don't do that!
那样他们就会认为他们可以过来012---That'll make them think they can come over.
所以呢  过来又如何呢012---So,what if they do?
我们不是来这里钓男人的012---We're not here to meet guys.
你有男友  我有小孩还有罗斯012---You have a boyfriend. I have a baby and a Ross.
是啊  但又不会发生什么事012---Yeah,but nothing has to happen.
只是玩玩而已012---We're just having fun.
不是每件事都得发展到眼神接触地步的012---You know,not everything has to go as far as eye contact.
钱德勒  你得告诉乔伊012---Chandler,you have to tell Joey
你不在塔尔萨012---you're not in Tulsa.
让他认为是你在欺骗我012---Isn't it better for him to think you're cheating on me..
总比他认为我在欺骗他好吧012---than for him to think I'm cheating on him?
我可听说过012---I heard it.
我不想让他误会我有外遇012---I don't want him to think I'm having an affair.
好了  我有个计划012---All right,I've got a plan.
我会从防火梯爬下去012---I'll go down the fire escape..
所有"完美计划"都是从012---Because all good plans start with,
"我会从防火梯爬下去"开始的012---"I'll go down the fire escape."
听我说完  女人012---Hear me out,woman!
我会从防火梯爬下去  然后等着012---I'll go down the fire escape and I'll wait for a while.
然后我从楼梯走上来012---Then when I come up the stairs
就像是我刚从塔尔萨回来一样012---it'll be like I just got back from Tulsa.
然后乔伊跟我进屋012---Joey and I will come in and see
看到这里根本没有男人012---that there's no guy in here.
你难道不怕乔伊会识破吗012---Aren't you afraid that Joey's gonna figure all this out?
我可听说过012---I heard it.
我要等一下012---I'm just gonna wait for a little while.
可怕的鸽子又回来了吗012---The scary pigeon's back?
超大的012---It's huge.
天啊  我不敢相信你住在那栋公寓012---Oh, my god. I can't believe you live in that building.

艾达·格林  完全不懂尊重个人空间012---Ida Greene? No sense of personal space..
闻起来像鸡  看起来像马铃薯012---kind of smells like chicken,looks like a potato.
"洋芋"是你奶奶012---"Spuds" is your grandmother?
那就是我"阿奶"012---That's my bubbe!
我们要再去几个派对012---So we're on our way to a couple of parties.
或许可以把你们的号码给我们012---Maybe we could get your numbers
如果遇到好玩的  打电话给你们012---and call if we find something fun?
我很抱歉012---I'm sorry,
我们并不期望012---we weren't really looking for anything
和你们会有艳遇发生012---to happen with you guys.
我有男朋友了012---I have a boyfriend.
好的  没关系012--- All right.  It's no big deal.
所以她有男朋友  那你的情形是怎样呢012---So she has a boyfriend. What is your situation?
有点复杂  我并没有男朋友  但是012---Well,it's complicated. I don't actually have a boyfriend,but..
那我可以跟你要电话号码吗012---Then can I have your number?
我很抱歉  不行012---I'm sorry,no.

我不知道  他很可爱012---I don't know. He was cute,
又喜欢我  我冲动之下就给他了012---and he liked me. It was an impulse.
那罗斯怎么办  你们的小火花呢012---But what about Ross? What about your moment?
你不想跟他谈谈吗  不想012--- Don't you wanna talk to him?  No.
不想  因为我非常清楚012---No,because I know exactly
谈话的结果会是怎样012---how the conversation's gonna go.
"嘿  罗斯012---"Hey,Ross,you know,
我觉得我们刚刚有点小火花"012---I think we had a moment before."
"是啊  我也这么认为"012---"Yeah. Me too."
"但是我不太确定012---"Well,but I'm not sure
我是不是想再更进一步"012---I really want to do anything about it."
"是啊  我也不确定"012---"Yeah. Me neither."
我们是不是就住在一起012---"Should we just live together..
然后不要告诉彼此  我们互相的感受012---and not tell each other how we're feeling?"
"是啊  我没意见"012---"Yeah,that works for me."
是啊  我懂你的意思012---Yeah,I see what you mean.
对了  你模仿罗斯真像012---By the way,nice Ross imitation.
但你模仿的瑞秋不够爱发牢骚012---Your Rachel wasn't whiny enough.

重点是我或许应该停止等待012---The point is maybe I should just stop waiting around
跟罗斯之间的小火花012---for moments with Ross.
我是说  我要继续过我自己的生活了012---You know? I should just move on with my life.
真的  你要放弃罗斯了012---So really,you're moving on from Ross?
我不知道  我得现在就做决定吗012---I don't know. Do I have to decide right now?
你好像已经做了012---You kind of just did.
那男的今晚会打电话给你012---That guy is gonna call you tonight.
罗斯会接起电话012---Ross will pick up the phone,
那传达的讯息已经很明显了012---and that's a pretty clear message.
噢  天啊  罗斯012---Oh,my God,Ross!
罗斯会接起电话012---Ross is gonna pick up the phone.

我很抱歉  亲爱的  但是012---I'm so sorry,honey,but..
瑞秋把自己的号码给了一个男人012---Okay,Rachel gave this guy her number..
她不希望罗斯去接电话012---and she doesn't want Ross to answer the phone.
所以你必须拦截他所有的电话012---So you have to intercept all his calls.
我不能那样做012---I can't do that!
他说他不能那样做  电话给我012--- He says he can't do that.  Give me the phone.

但事实上  关于下流的事  她说的没错012---But actually,she wasn't wrong about the dirty stuff.

你倒是挺快的012---That didn't take long.
你不是说塔尔萨到这里要飞三小时吗012---I thought you said Tulsa was,like,a threehour flight?

你就不能把这个藏到衣橱里吗012---and you can't put that in the closet?
所以  除了发酵过程不同之外012---So,with the exception of the fermentation process..
啤酒跟麦酒基本上是相同的东西012---beer and ale are basically the same thing.
真引人入胜  不是吗012---Fascinating,isn't it?
或许你应该查一下"引人入胜"的意思012---Maybe you should look up "fascinating."
我来接012---I'll get it!

几乎所有人都知道她是个女孩012---Almost everybody knew that she was a girl.
是啊  你揍了那个错认为是男孩的家伙后012---Yeah,after you punched that one guy who got it wrong,
消息很快传开了012---word spread.
我要进去我办公室拿点东西012---I'm just gonna go in my office and pick up some stuff.
你他妈是谁  你他妈又是谁012--- Who the hell are you?  Who the hell are you?
我是这间办公室的主人012---I'm the hell person whose office this is.
说的好  瑞秋012---Good one,Rach.
我是加文·米奇012---I'm Gavin Mitchell,
接下来要接替你工作的人012---the person who's taking over your job.
什么012---Excuse me?
你的宝宝真可爱012---Your baby's so cute.
但是为什么012---But why would you
在男孩头上贴个粉红色蝴蝶结呢012---put a pink bow on a boy?
嘿  乔伊  看看我012---Hey,Joey. Look at me.
我是护士耶012---I'm a nurse.
是啊  真是呢012---Yes,you are.
我想该是擦海棉澡的时候了012---I think it might be time for my sponge bath.
对不起  我太习惯泡临时演员了012---Sorry,I'm just so used to hitting on the extras.
你很期待出场吗012---So are you excited about your scene?
是啊  但是我有点紧张012---Yeah,but I'm a little nervous.
放轻松  别紧张  没事的012---Relax. Don't be. You will be fine.
他们可能只会要你站在后面012---They'll probably just make you stand in the background.
好了  好了012---OK. OK. OK
你  站这里  过来  这里  好的012---You. Here,come here. Here.  OK
你拿着这个托盘  站在黄线这里012---Take this tray,stand on this yellow mark.
听到"开拍"就开始移动012---You're gonna move on "action."
走向手术台  停在蓝线那边012---Walk over to the operating table,stop on the blue mark
然后把托盘放下012---and put the tray down.
别走太快012---Don't walk too fast.
但是也别太慢012---But don't dawdle.
好吧  到底是怎样012---Okay. Now,what?
开拍012---And,action!
停  停012---Cut! Cut.
我很抱歉  我只是有点紧张012---I'm sorry. I'm just a little nervous.
那就别紧张012---Well,don't be.
好吧  你的话真"有用"012---Okay,that helps.
开拍012---And,action!
停012---Cut!
那个  别担心  菲比012---You know what? Don't worry about it,Phoebe.
我通常也要3次才能拍成功012---It usually takes me three takes too.
好啦  是8次012---All right,eight.
开拍012---And,action!
那你对于广告还有其他问题吗012---So do you have any other questions about advertising?
没有  但是让我表演一下我的专长012---No. But let me show you what I can do.
百吉饼和甜甜圈012---"Bagels and doughnuts.
任何心情都适合吃的圆圈圈012---Round food for every mood."
莫妮卡警告过我  你可能会这样做012---Monica warned me you might do that.
我想我们公司可能有个适合你的职务012---I think we might have something for you at the agency.
真的吗  太好了012---Really? That's great.
有个不付薪水的实习职位012---It's an unpaid internship.
真好笑  当你说"不付薪水"的时候012---That's funny. When you said "unpaid,"
听起来好像是"不给钱"的意思012---it sounded like you said "unpaid."
别这样  莫妮卡有份很不错的工作012---Come on,now. Monica has a good job.
又不是说你要养家糊口012---It's not like you have a family to support.
事实上  我们正想生个孩子012---Actually,we're trying.
我不认为莫妮卡想要延期012---I don't think Monica is gonna want to postpone it.
我们原打算今晚做爱的012---We're supposed to have sex tonight.
事实上  她现在或许就在家012---Actually,she's probably at home,
一丝不挂的012---naked right now.
如果没有人阻止我  我会一直说话012---I tend to keep talking till somebody stops me.
我可以想像她在床上的样子  停012--- I can just picture her on the bed.  Stop!
好吧012---OK.
等等012---Wait a minute.
你说要接替我的工作是什么意思012---What do you mean you're taking over my job?
你休产假的时候012---While you were on your baby vacation,
你的工作是我在做的012---I was doing your job.
假期  我对假期的定义可不包括012---A vacation? My idea of a vacation does not involve..
让什么东西吸我的乳房  吸到破皮012---something sucking on my nipples until they are raw.
很显然  你从未去过天堂度假岛012---Clearly,you've never been to Sandals Paradise lsland.
好了  别让你自己太舒服012---All right. Don't get too comfortable there,
因为我两个星期之后就回来了012---because I'm back in two weeks.
我要一切回归原状012---I want everything back the way it was.
我实在不太满意012---I can't say I care too much
你重新摆设我办公室的方式012---for the way you've rearranged my office.
我也实在不太满意你带进来的臭味012---I can't say I care too much for that smell you've brought in.
你说什么012---Excuse me?
瑞秋  我们面临"棕色警报状况"012---Rach,we have a code brown situation.
亲爱的  可以拜托你帮我处理一下吗012---Honey,could you please take care of it for me?
好吧  但是有时候你也该处理一次012---All right,but you're gonna have to do one sometime.
让我把话说清楚012---Let me just get this straight.
我去生个小孩012---So I go have a baby,
然后他们派一个人过来接我的工作012---and they send some guy in to do my job?
本来说要关闭整个罗夫罗兰的012---Well,there was talk of shutting down Ralph Lauren altogether.
好了  你真是个不要脸的临时工012---Okay. Right. You're very cheeky for a temp.
我不是临时工012---I'm not a temp.
我是从别的部门调过来的012---I was transferred here from another department.
是什么部门呢  混蛋部门吗012---And what department was that? The jerk department?
他们并没有告诉我  你反应是如此快012---They didn't tell me about your quick wit.
那他们有没有告诉你012---Well,did they mention
我是橡胶  你是胶水吗012---that I'm rubber and you're glue?
加文  罗夫很喜欢你的创意012---Gavin,Ralph loved your ideas.
嗨  泽纳先生012---Hi,Mr. Zelner.
瑞秋  我想你见过加文了012---Rachel. I see you've met Gavin.
当你离开的时候012---When you left us,
我们都不知道该怎么办012---we weren't sure what we were gonna do.
但是  加文拯救了我们  超级加文012---But then,Gavin to the rescue. Super Gavin.
噢  太好了  太好了012---Well,that's great. that's great.
那么  超级加文  当我回来以后012---So now,Super Gavin,when I come back..
你计划要飞到哪去呢012---where do you plan on flying off to?
全看泽纳先生的意思012---That's up to Mr. Zelner.
我相信他会做出正确的决定012---I'm sure he'll make the right decision.
超级马屁精012---Super asskissing power.
对了  你什么时候回来呢012---Incidentally,when are you coming back?
今天012---Today.
你刚刚说两星期后012---You said two weeks.
不  我是说今天012---No,I said today.
看吧  身为超级英雄012---See,for a superhero,
听话能力有点差劲哦012---not so much with the listening.
他怎么说呢012---So,what'd he say?
他有时候有点粗暴012---He can be a little rough around the edges..
所以我打算将他使用012---so I'm gonna replace a word
频率很高的一个脏字换成"小狗"012---he used a lot with the word "puppy."
他说  如果你的"小狗"朋友012---So he said,"If your puppy friend
不能"小狗"演好她的角色012---doesn't get her puppy act together..
我将会"小狗"般地开除她012---I am gonna fire her motherpuppy ass."
我很抱歉  我办不到012---I'm sorry. I can't do this.
我不是演员的料012---I'm just not an actor.
没错  你不是演员  你是护士012---That's right. You're not. You're a nurse.
你是拿托盘的护士  别  乔伊012--- You're Nurse With Tray.  No,Joey..
不  拿托盘的护士不认识乔伊的012---No, no. Nurse With Tray doesn't know Joey.
她没有时间交朋友012---She has no time for friends.
她进去手术室012---She gets in that operating room
把托盘交给医生012---and she carries that tray to the doctor..
因为如果她不这样做  会死人的012---because if she doesn't,people die.
谁会死012---Who dies?
戴眼罩的男人012---Man With Eye Patch!
现在你过去做好你的工作012---Now,you get in there,and you do your job.
遵命  医生  好的012--- Yes,doctor. OK
好了  我们再试一次012---Okay,let's try this one more time.
撑着点  戴眼罩的男人012---Hang in there,Man With Eye Patch.
你的托盘来了012---Your tray is coming.
开拍012---And,action.
太棒了  我办到了  我搞定了012---Yes,I did it! I nailed it!
接下来是什么呢012---What's next?
继续后面的剧情012---The rest of the scene.
好吧  大家  从头开始012---Okay,from the top,people.
听着  计划有变012---Listen,sudden change of plans.
我的产假刚刚结束了012---My maternity leave just ended.
他们说如果我不今天回去工作012---They said if I didn't come back today,
他们就要开除我012---they'd fire me.
什么 那是非法的012---What? No,that's illegal.
我要马上通知工会  他们不...012---I'll have the Labor Department here so fast,they won't..
好了  冷静点  诺玛蕾（工会创建者）012---All right,calm down,Norma Rae.
他们并没有真的那样说012---They didn't actually say that.
我只是害怕如果不现在回去012---I'm just afraid if I don't come back now,
那个男的会把我挤掉012---this guy will try and squeeze me out.
那艾玛怎么办呢012---But what about Emma?
我们还没有找到保姆012---I mean,we don't have a nanny.
我知道  我们只好今晚再想办法了012---I know. We're just gonna have to figure out a plan tonight.
今天你可以先照顾她吗012---Can you please just take care of her for today?
当然  只要把你的乳房给我012---Absolutely. Just give me your breasts,
我们马上就走012---and we'll be on our way.
别这样  我不知道还能怎么办012---Come on. I don't know what else to do.
好啦  好啦012---Fine. Fine.
我们会很开心的  不是吗012---We'll have fun,won't we?
是的  我们会  是的  我们012---Yes,we will. Yes,we..
罗斯012---Ross.
你好漂亮012---You're pretty.
不管我决定要做什么012---Whatever I decide to do,
我都得从基层做起012---I'm gonna be starting a new career from scratch.
得很长一段时间后才能活得滋润些012---It's gonna be a while before I make a living at it.
或许现在不是生小孩的好时机012---Maybe now's not the right time to be starting a family.
所以你要跟莫妮卡说012---So you have to tell Monica
你现在不想要生小孩012---you don't want to have a baby right now?
是啊012---Yeah.
永别了012---Goodbye.
好了  造人时间  裤子脱掉  宾012---Okay,it's baby time. Pants off,Bing.
没看到你也在  盖勒012---Didn't see you there,Geller.
罗斯在这里  所以012---Ross is here,so..
我真的希望  可以跟你们待在一起012---And I was really hoping that maybe I could hang out.
你们想做什么呢012---You know,what do you feel like doing?
我们想要做爱012---Well,we're gonna have sex.
我倒是不太想做爱012---I don't feel like having sex.
或许  我不知道012---Maybe.. I don't know.
或许我们可以一起看电影什么的012---Maybe we can watch a movie or something.
我就直说了吧012---Let me put it this way:
不管你在不在  我们都要做爱012---We're having sex whether you're here or not.
裤子脱掉  宾012---Pants off,Bing.
听着  现在既然我回来了012---All right. Now that I'm back,
何不向我报告一下012---why don't you just fill me in
你都干了些什么012---on what you've been up to.
嗯  我把你超级男孩的屏保改了012---Well,I've changed your screen saver from that picture of NSYNC.
嘿  我离开时  他们可是很受欢迎的012---Hey,they were popular when I left.
但我主要忙于准备012---Mostly I've just been working on
明天的一个重要报告展示012---this big presentation for tomorrow.
我应该要参与  向我说明一下吧012---I should be involved in that,so get me up to speed.
那得花上好几个星期012---That'll take weeks.
你不如就让我负责那个报告吧012---Why don't you just let me take care of the presentation.
不  我知道你在玩什么花样  好吗012---No. I see what you're doing here,all right?
听着  这是我的工作  老兄012---Listen, this is my job,buddy.
我已经做了五年了  我知道一切流程012---I've had it for five years,and I know how it works.
所以赶快向我汇报说明  好012--- So why don't you just catch me up.  Fine.
天啊012---Oh,God.
你把我椅子的高度完全变了012---You've totally messed with the back support on my chair.
你是怎么弄的012---How do you fix this?
你已经在这里五年了012---You've been here five years.
你自己想吧  很好  我自己来012--- You figure it out.  Fine,I will.
好了  开始汇报吧012---All right,fill me in.
你有没有蓝色的领带配我的衣服012---Do you have a blue tie that would go with this?
艾玛吐奶到我的领带上012---Emma spit up on mine.
有啊  但等我找到工作时要还给我012---Yeah,but you have to give it back if I get a job.
当然  到那时候  领带已经被淘汰了012---Of course,by that time, future ties will be obsolete..
而我们都将穿起银色的连身装012---and we'll all be wearing silver jumpsuits.
早安  爱人012---Hey,good morning,lover.
我得说  经过昨夜的激战012---I gotta say,after last night,
我的双腿还在发软012---I'm a little weak in the knees.
麻烦你  每次走进来的时候012---Here's an idea. You walk into a room,
先快速看一下四周吧012---take a quick scan.
抱歉012---Sorry.
但是我有点觉得012---But I kind of have this feeling
我们昨晚造人成功了012---that we may have made a baby last night.
噢  天  我必须告诉你一件事012---Oh,God,I have to tell you something.
你没有怀孕012---You're not pregnant.
你在说什么012---What are you talking about?
嗯  能让你受精的那件事012---Well,that thing that I have to do to make a baby?
我装的012---I faked it.
什么  你装的012---What? You faked it?
你知道吗012---You know what?
我不需要领带了012---I don't need a tie.
我是说  领子开着比较好  不是吗012---I mean,it's better open collar,you know?
比较轻松自在012---It's more casual.
乔伊  听着  我办不到012---Joey. Listen,I can't do this.
简直是毫无道理012---It doesn't make any sense.
昨天我是护士  然后今天我是服务生012---Yesterday I was a nurse,and today I'm a waitress at a cafe?
有时候我们会用相同的临时演员012---Sometimes we use the same extras
扮演不同的角色  没关系的012---for different parts. It's okay.
是有关系的012---Well,it's not okay,
因为昨天我扮演护士  演的相当好012---because I gave a very memorable performance as the nurse.
然后现在突然间  我变成服务生012---And now,suddenly,I'm the waitress?
我的影迷们会混淆的012---That's gonna confuse my fans.
嗯  或许你是护士012---Well,maybe you are a nurse..
但是你也兼职当服务生012---but you moonlight as a waitress.
因为我是抚养两个小孩的单亲妈妈012---Because I'm a single mother supporting my two children.
没错012---Nice.
等一下012---Wait a minute.
德雷克·拉莫瑞医生012---Dr. Drake Ramoray
跟我在同间医院工作012---and I work at the same hospital.
我不用过来跟他打招呼吗012---Wouldn't I come say hi to him?
不  不  你跟德雷克吵架了012---No. No,see,you and Drake are having a fight.
吵什么012---About what?
他跟你上过床012---He slept with you..
但是他再也没有打电话给你012---And then never called you.
而我只想帮大卫和贝琪找个新爸爸012---And I just wanted a new daddy for Davey and Becky.
好了  好了  从头开始012---Okay. Okay,from the top.
开拍012---And,action.
我很讶异你会同意跟我共用午餐012---So I'm surprised you agreed to have lunch with me.
我也很讶异  但我终究是来了012---I'm surprised too. But yet,here I am.
停停012---Cut! Cut!
你在搞什么012---What, what are you doing?
我很气他  因为他跟我上过床之后012---I'm very angry at him because he slept with me
却再也没打电话给我了012---and never called me back.
我也是 还有我012--- Me too.  Me too!
冷静点  她是说在剧情里面012---Calm down. She means on the show.
我们需要新的临时演员012---We need some new extras around here.
哇  你已经到了012---Wow. You're here already.
是的  艾玛跟我提早进来012---Yes. Emma and I came in a little early
准备报告的相关资料012---to do research on the presentation.
事实上  我做了一些修改012---Actually,I made a few changes.
我觉得相关情况我已完全了解了012---I think I'm caught up on everything.
随便问我一个问题吧012---So ask me anything.
你要怎么调整椅子呢  除了这个012--- How do you fix the chair?  Except that!
嗨  泽纳先生012---Hello,Mr. Zelner.
今天下午的报告  我们都已经准备好了012---We are all ready for our presentation this afternoon.
很好  因为10分钟之后就要开始了012---Good,because it's in 10 minutes.
什么  我做不到  我宝宝在这里012---What? I can't do that. I have the baby.
罗斯一个小时之后才会来接她012---Ross is not gonna pick her up for an hour.
那加文可以上台报告  好吗012---Then Gavin can give the presentation, ok?
我们必须现在就开始012---We have to do it now.
罗夫今天要提早走012---Ralph needs to leave early today.
他要搭直升机去购物012---He's going helicopter shopping.
顺你的意了  你赢了  你赢了012---Well,there you go,you win. You win.
你可以上台报告  让他们爱死你012---You get to do the presentation. You'll knock them dead.
没有人会记得我在这里工作过012---No one will remember that I worked here,
然后罗夫会搭上直升机012---and then Ralph will buy his helicopter..
而超级加文会跟他一起飞012---and Super Gavin will just fly right alongside of him.
你可以上台去做报告012---You can do the presentation.
不  我不行  我宝宝在这里012---No,I can't. I have a baby.
我会看着她012---I'll watch her.
你为什么要这样012---Why would you do that?
因为你工作很认真  而这是你的工作012---Because you worked really hard, and it's your job.
而且你有点疯狂012---And you're a little crazy.
你真的很好012---That's really nice.
我应该告诉你012---I should tell you that
哭泣的女人让我觉得很不自在012---crying women make me very uncomfortable.
那你可能不会喜欢接下来要发生的事012---Well,you're not gonna like what's coming.
我很抱歉  我很抱歉012---I'm sorry,I'm sorry.
我很抱歉  我很抱歉012---I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
天呐012---God.
谢谢你  谢谢你012---Thank you. Thank you.

请不要开除我的朋友012---Please don't fire my friend.

谢谢  谢谢012---Thank you.Thank you.
我帮你一个忙如何012---How about I do something for you?
明天  我帮你带一顶帽子012---Tomorrow,I'll bring you a hat,
让你遮住秃头012---cover up the bald.
听着  菲比  我刚跟导演谈完012---Listen,Phoebe. I was just talking to the director..
他说  或许  这一次你不要打德雷克012---and he was thinking maybe this time you don't hit Drake.
你只要端盘子就可以了012---You just wait on the tables.
我做不到012---I can't do that.
我是演员  我有原则的012---I'm an actor. I have a process.
你是按摩师  你有张挖了个洞的桌子012---You're a masseuse. You have a table with a hole in it.
等等  我知道这是怎么回事了012---Wait,I see what's happening here.
你感到威胁了012---You're threatened.
什么012---What?
我的演技太好  抢了你的风头012---I'm so good in the scene that I'm stealing focus from you.
接受挑战吧  崔比安尼012---Rise to the challenge,Tribbiani,
因为我提高了擂台标准012---because I just raised the bar.
提升自己  向我看齐吧012---Come join me up here.
你可以开除她  但是最好叫警卫过来012---Yeah,you can fire her,but I would call security.
她不会那么容易走的012---She won't go easy.
你装的  你不可能装的012---You faked it? You couldn't have faked it.
是可以的  只要装点表情跟声音012---Yes,you can. You just make the faces and the noises.
男人可以装高潮吗012---Guys can fake it?
难以置信  伪装高潮明明是女人的专利012---Unbelievable. The one thing that's ours.
你为何要伪装高潮呢012---Why would you fake it
我们是要生个小孩呀012---when we're trying to have a baby?
那正是我要装的原因012---Well,that's actually why.
听着  我正在换工作012---Look,I'm starting a whole new career now.
我不是说我不想要孩子012---I'm not saying I don't want a baby.
只是  或许我们可以等一阵子012---I'm just saying maybe we could wait a little while.
一个月吗012---Like a month?
或是一年012---Or a year?
不是吧  你想要等一年012---Really? You wanna wait a year?
或许等不到一年012---It could be less than a year.
我是说  你知道我的能力012---I mean,you've heard my stuff.
"裤子  跟内裤一样  只是长一点"012---"Pants. Like shorts but longer."
可能会不止一年吧012---It'll probably be more than a year.
我真的很想生个孩子012---I really wanna have a baby.
嗯  是啊  我也是012---Well,yeah,me too.
听着  我回去做老本行好了012---Look,I'll just get my old job back.
不  我要你做你热爱的工作012---No,I want you to have a job that you love..
不是什么数据分析跟资料重组的012---not statistical analysis and data reconfiguration.
我辞职后  你才了解我在做什么012---I quit,and you learn what I do?
我觉得永远不会有012---I think there's never gonna be
适合生小孩的完美时机012---a right time to have a baby.
现在你失业了  但一阵子过后012---Now you're unemployed,and in a little while..
你就会找到一份让你忙不过来的工作012---you'll find a new job that'll keep you really busy.
总是会有理由不能生小孩的012---There's always gonna be a reason not to do this..
但是我想  一旦有了孩子012---but I think once the baby comes,
我们就会忘了这一切的理由012---we'll forget about all those reasons.
我想也是012---I guess.
我是说  有小孩总是很吓人的事012---I mean,it's always gonna be scary when we have a baby.
真的会是很吓人的012---It's gonna be really scary.
老天  等我们有了孩子012---I mean,God,when we have a baby..
将会有许多事情超乎我们的掌控012---there's gonna be so much that we're not able to control.
我是说  公寓将会一团乱012---I mean,the apartment's gonna be a mess.
我会没有时间整理012---I won't have time to clean it.
要是宝宝跑到缎带抽屉里012---What if the baby gets into the ribbon drawer..
把所有的缎带都弄乱了呢012---and messes up all the ribbons?
万一没有地方可以放缎带012---What if there's no room for a ribbon drawer..
所有的空间都被宝宝的东西占满了呢012---because the baby's stuff takes up all the space?
缎带要放哪呢012---Where will all the ribbons go?
要不要在你改变主意前  赶快去受孕012---Should we go make a baby before you change your mind?
是啊  快点  好的012--- Yes,please!  Okay.
而且我保证  这一次我不会装了012---And I promise I will not fake it this time.
我希望我也可以说相同的话012---Well,I wish I could say the same.
我仍有点战栗012---I'm a little shook up.
我知道你故意导致手术失败的012---I know you botched that operation on purpose.
我现在还没有办法证明012---I can't prove it yet,
但等我拿到证据012---but when I do,
你会因谋杀而坐牢的012---you'll be going to jail for murder.
我不在乎你是不是我弟弟012---I don't care if you are my brother.
我不是你弟弟012---I'm not your brother.
我的孩子怎么办呢  德雷克012---What about my children,Drake?
不  不  不012---No! No! No!
天啊012---God!
莫妮卡呢  她在家012--- Where's Mon?  She's at home..
布置瑞秋今晚的生日派对012---putting up decorations for Rachel's birthday party tonight.
你不用帮忙吗  我有试过012--- You're not helping?  I tried..
但是  显然012---but apparently
用假音唱《我会活下去》可帮不上忙012---singing "I Will Survive" in a helium voice,not helping.
嘿  你们好  嘿012--- Hey,guys.  Hey.
祝你生日...012---Happy birthday to...
别说那么大声  甘瑟会过来抱我的012---Don't say that loud. Gunther's gonna want to hug me.
好消息  我们终于找到保姆了012---Good news,everyone. We finally found a nanny.
这位是莫莉012---This is Molly.
莫莉  来见过钱德勒  乔伊012---Molly,Chandler,Joey.
有人有点不高兴哦012---Somebody's getting a little fussy.
你说的没错  我就是不高兴012---You're damn right I am.
我已经等饼干等了七分钟了012---I've been waiting for a cookie for seven minutes.
好了  我想我带她出去好了012---Okay. You know what,I'm just gonna take her outside.
不  你留下来  我去012---No,you stay. I'll do it.
好的  谢谢012---Okay. Thank you.
很高兴认识你们  是啊  我们也是012--- Nice to meet you guys.  Yeah,you too.
哇  莫莉真的很不错  是啊012--- Wow,Molly's just great.  Yeah.
是啊  真棒  请了个性感保姆012---Yes,bravo on the hot nanny.
什么 你真觉得她很性感吗012---What? You really think she's hot?
你开什么玩笑012---Are you kidding?
如果我未婚  她现在就在拒绝我了012---If I wasn't married,she'd be rejecting me right now.
乔伊012---Joey?
觉得她的姿势怎样012---How do you think she's doing?
我是唯一不觉得她性感的吗  罗斯012---Am I the only one that doesn't think she's hot? Ross?
我觉得  她不是没有魅力  但是012---I mean,she's not unattractive,but..
但是性感嘛012---but hot?
谢谢你012---Thank you.
瑞秋走了  说吧012---Now that Rachel's gone?
她真性感  我昨晚是哭着入睡的012---So hot,I cried myself to sleep last night.
《老友记》  第九季 第12集  菲比的老鼠012---Friends S09E12 The One With Phoebe's Rats
嘿  麦克  秘鲁的首都是哪里012---Hey,Mike,what's the capital of Peru?
利马  不是012--- Lima.  No.
是V开头X结尾的字012---It starts with a V and ends with an X.
然后最好中间有T和O012---And hopefully with a TO in the middle.
我仔细想想之后012---You know,come to think of it,
秘鲁的首都应该叫"VTOX"012---the capital of Peru is "Vtox."
哦  天啊 怎么了012--- Oh,God!  What?
好了  我不想要吓坏你012---Okay. I don't want to freak you out or anything..
但是我刚在柜子里看到一只老鼠012---but I just saw a rat in your cupboard.
哦  是哦  那是鲍伯012---Oh,yeah. No,that's Bob.
是你的宠物鼠吗012---Well,he's your pet rat?
不太算是  只是偶尔会来拜访012---Well,not so much a pet as,you know,an occasional visitor..
我有时候会喂他  有点像圣诞老人012---who I put food out for. Kind of like Santa.
不过圣诞老人不会在饼干盘里便便012---Except Santa doesn't poop on the plate of cookies.
你不能在公寓里养老鼠012---You can't keep a rat in your apartment.
那很不卫生的012---They're extremely unsanitary.
它们会传染细螺旋体病或是汉滩病毒012---I mean,they transmit leptospirosis and hantavirus.
那是什么  我不知道012---What are those?  I don't know..
但听起来可不像是温泉疗养012---but they don't sound like spa treatments.
你必须处理掉他  好啦012--- You have to get rid of it.  Okay,fine.
如果你这么在乎  我会处理掉鲍伯的012---If it means that much to you,I'll get rid of Bob.
谢谢你012---Thank you.
真奇怪  你觉得他很恶心012---It's so weird you think he's so gross,
却又在吃他的饼干012---yet you're willing to eat his crackers.
加文  我想再次跟你道谢012---Gavin,I just want to say thank you again..
谢谢昨天帮我照顾艾玛012---for watching Emma yesterday during the presentation.
我真的需要跟你道歉012---I really owe you an apology.
道什么歉012---For what?
当我们第一次见面时  你知道的012---When we first met,you know..
我以为你是自负  高傲又讨人厌的人012---I thought you were pompous and arrogant and obnoxious.
你待会儿又得接着道歉吧012---Is this your first apology?
不  我只是想说012---No,I just mean,you know,
第一印象通常不是很重要的012---first impressions don't mean anything.
而我认为你是个好男人012---And I think you're a really good guy.
很抱歉我错看了你012---And I'm sorry that I misjudged you.
早安  嗨012--- Morning.  Hello.
我想说  新的一天  新的开始012---But you know what? Hey,new day,new leaf.
我只是真的很高兴012---I am just really,really happy..
我很抱歉  显然012---I'm sorry. Obviously,
海瑟的屁股有更重要的事要对你说012---Heather's ass has something more important to say..
我先让它说完好了012---so I'll just wait till it's finished.
什么  我正在跟你道歉012--- What?  I was giving you an apology..
而你一直在打量她012---and you were totally checking her out.
我没有  我在时装业工作012---I wasn't. I'm in fashion.
我只是在看她的裙子012---I was looking at her skirt.
貌似是裤子吧  我并没有看清楚012---Or was it pants? I didn't really see
屁股以下的部位012---what happened below the ass area.
哇  你真的是  你真恶心012---Wow,you are really.. You're really a creep.
就算我是在看她  你又在乎什么呢012---What do you care if I was looking at her?
你是在忌妒吗012---Are you jealous?
哦  是啊  我好忌妒012---Oh,yeah. I'm jealous.
"哦  加文  拜托请看看我的屁股"012---"Oh,Gavin. Please,please look at my ass."
不要看我的屁股012---Stop looking at my ass!
我只是认为这样的行为是不妥的012---I mean,I just think you are totally inappropriate. Okay?
这是工作场所  她是你下属012---This is a work environment. She's your subordinate.
但你跟你前助理泰格上床就可以吗012---But it was okay when you slept with your old assistant,Tag?
那完全不一样  原因有二012---That is totally different for two reasons.
一  我不知道你知道那件事012---One: I didn't know that you knew that.
二  我不是盯着他屁股看的恶心人012---And two: I wasn't some creep staring at his ass.
我们有很深入  有意义的交往012---We had a.. We had a deep,meaningful relationship.
泰格姓什么012---What was Tag's last name?
是...012---It was..
哦  我的天012---Oh,my God.
他没有  他没有 他没有姓012---He didn't.. He didn't.. He didn't have a last name.
就叫泰格而已  就像雪儿  或是012---It was just Tag,you know,like Cher or..
摩西012---you know,Moses.
但那是很深入  有意义的交往012---But it was a deep,meaningful relationship.
好吧  我对你的第一印象完全正确012---You know what? My first impression of you was absolutely right.
你高傲  又自负012---You are arrogant. You are pompous.
摩根  摩根012---Morgan! Morgan!
泰格姓摩根 是琼斯012--- Tag's last name was Morgan!  It was Jones.
你是谁啊  他男朋友吗012---What are you,his boyfriend?
天啊  我希望我有个像你一样的保姆012---Man,I wish I had a nanny like you.
你是说你小时候吗012---You mean when you were a baby?
当然012---Sure.
你可不可以别再盯着她看012---Would you stop staring at her?
我没有盯着012---I wasn't staring.
我是斜眼瞄着012---I was leering.
她有什么了不起的呢012---What's the big deal with her?
或许她有很抢眼的魅力012---Maybe she's attractive in an obvious kind of way.
是啊  抢眼的魅力最糟糕了012---Yeah,obvious beauty's the worst.
你知道的  当它就显现在你面前时012---You know,when it's right there in your face.
我比较喜欢渐渐去发掘一个人的魅力012---Me,I like to have to work to find someone attractive.
让我感觉像是我辛苦得来的012---Makes me feel like I earned it.
看起来乔伊好像跟她处的不错012---Looks like Joey's doing all right with her.
是啊  你们两个这次愿意退让出012---Yeah. Hey,that was nice of you guys to back off..
让乔伊去泡她  真是好心012---and let Joey get the girl for once.
我要带她回去了012---I'm gonna take her to the apartment.
好的  我下班之后就回去012---Okay. I'll be home right after work.
好的 好的  艾玛  再见012--- Okay.  Okay,bye,Emma.
我爱你012---I love you.
再见 再见012--- Bye.  Bye.
他们推选我来跟你说012---They've elected me to talk to you
你模仿婴儿说话的事012---about the baby talk.
大家不是很喜欢012---It's not so good.
我觉得挺可爱的012---I think it's sweet.
再见  艾玛012---Bye,Emma!
嘿  乔伊  关于莫莉012---Hey,listen,Joey. About Molly,
我希望你不要去动她012---I would really prefer if you didn't go after her.
为什么不行012---Why not?
因为我们花了好几个月才找到好保姆012---It took months to find a good nanny.
而我不希望有任何事情让她离开012---And I wouldn't want anything to,you know,drive her away.
所以你认为我只会跟她上床012---So you think I'm just gonna sleep with her..
之后就不再打电话给她012---and never call her again,
让一切都变得很尴尬吗012---and things are gonna get uncomfortable?
是啊  听起来好像也对012---Yeah,that sounds about right.
别这样  外面到处都是女人012---Come on,there are plenty of other women out there.
别打她的主意  不可以碰她012---Just forget about her,okay? She's offlimits.
天啊  你为什么要这样说呢012---Oh,man! What'd you have to go and say that for?
你越说我不可以碰她012---Now that you told me I can't have her,
我就越想要她了012---makes me want her even more!
你还是小孩啊  是的012--- What are you,a child?  Yes!
听着  乔伊  别这样  为了我  拜托012---Look,Joey,come on now. For me,please.
把你的性能量转移到别人身上012---Just try to focus your sexual energy on someone else.
好啦012---Fine.
带我回家吧012---Take me home.
嘿  麦克  嘿  菲比012--- Hey,Mikey.  Hey,Phoebe.
你在做什么呢  放捕鼠器012--- What are you doing?  Setting rattraps.
要杀鲍伯吗012---To kill Bob?
不是  只是测试一下他脖子有多硬012---No. No,to test his neck strength.
不  我不想杀死他012---No,I don't want to kill him.
我以为我们要活抓他012---I thought we were gonna capture him..
然后到乡下把他放生012---and,you know,set him free in the countryside..
让他可以认识友善的负鼠012---where he could meet a friendly possum..
或是爱说笑的猫头鹰012---and a wisecracking owl.
好了  我把捕鼠器丢掉012---Okay,okay. I'll throw away the traps.
好  我会找到鲍伯  我会抓到他的012---All right,I'll find Bob. I'll get him.
鲍伯  鲍伯012---Bob? Bob?
罗伯特012---Robert?
等等  我听到他的声音了012---Wait,I think I hear him.
天啊  鲍伯生小孩了 鲍伯当妈妈了012---Oh,my God! Bob had babies! Bob's a mom!
我们得替她改名字了012---We'll have to think of a new name.
我不知道  我喜欢"鲍伯"当女生名字012---I don't know,I kind of like "Bob" for a girl.
不不  我是说我不确定我们012---No,no. I mean,I'm not sure that we..
天啊  我们杀了鲍伯吗012---Oh,my God. We killed Bob?
或许不是鲍伯  或许只是只老鼠012---Well,maybe it wasn't Bob. Maybe it was a mouse.
苏西012---Susie?
怎么样012---What's up?
说真的  老兄  三年了012---Seriously,dude. Three years ago.
听着  你可以帮我一个忙吗012---Listen,can you do me a favor?
我今天要出去012---I'm gonna be out today.
你可以帮我看着乔伊012---Can you keep an eye on Joey..
确保他跟莫莉之间不会出事吗012---make sure nothing happens between him and Molly?
你不相信他吗  不相信012--- You don't trust him?  Well,no.
有个听起来很像乔伊声音的女人012---Some woman who sounded a lot like Joey
之前打电话来012---called earlier..
要找她称之为"性感保姆"的女儿012---and asked for her daughter,the "hot nanny."
你打算让我长期干预他们吗012---Is this your longterm plan,for me to run interference?
我可能随时都会找到工作的012---Because I could get a job any day now.
你在某些方面真是拔尖人才012---You do appear right on the cusp of something.
听着  拜托  老兄012---Look,come on,man.
我确定他一两星期后就会没兴趣了012---I'm sure he'll lose interest in a week or two..
但是目前  你可以帮我这个忙吗012---but for now,could you please just do this for me?
好啦  但是如果失败可别怪我哦012---Fine,but don't blame me if it doesn't work.
因为你也了解  乔伊一旦下定决心012---Because you know once Joey sets his mind on something..
无论如何  他都会把她搞上手的012---more often than not,he's going to have sex with it.
那我们得要做点什么  不是吗012---Well,I mean,we've gotta do something. Okay?
她那样的保姆可不是树上凭空长出来的012---Nannies like her don't grow on trees.
在想像那棵树吗  是的  没错012--- Picturing that tree?  I am,yes.
你要去哪  乔012---Where you going,Joe?
去散步012---For a walk.
我也去好吗012---You mind if I join you?
事实上  我想要一个人去012---Actually,I'd rather be alone.
我真的需要理清一些想法012---You know,I really need to organize my thoughts.
一"些"想法012---Your thoughts?
复数的012---Plural?
好啦  我只有一个想法012---All right,fine. I only have one thought.
就是关于那个性感保姆  我必须见到她012---It's about the hot nanny! I gotta see her!
恐怕我不能让你去  乔伊012---I'm afraid I can't let you do that,Joe.
你是说我不能见她012---Now you're saying I can't see her?
你简直让我生不如死012---You're killing me!
她就像是禁果  就像是...012---She's forbidden fruit! It's like,like..
她是公主  而我是马童012---like she's the princess and I'm the stable boy.
为什么你要这样012---Why are you doing this,huh?
是不是罗斯要你别让我过去的呢012---Did Ross tell you not to let me go over there?
没错  事实上的确如此012---Yes,as a matter of fact,he did.
所以我不能让你过去012---So I can't let you go.
有趣  现在出现挡路的了012---Interesting. Now there are obstacles.
性感保姆和我一起抵抗全世界012---Hot nanny and me against the world!
伟大的爱情小说就源自类似的生活故事012---This is the stuff great novels are made of.
伟大的爱情小说?012---Great novels?
好啦  二流的情色书刊012---Fine. Mediocre porn.

我有个问题必须要问你012---I have a question I need to ask you.
妈  我再回电给你  是的012---Mom,I'll call you later. Yeah.
怎样  如果你那么喜欢看屁股012--- Yes?  If you like looking at butts so much..
你何不自己去照镜子呢012---why don't you just go look in a mirror?
感谢上帝  你终于说了012---Thank God you finally said that.
三小时前我就看到你写在笔记本上了012---I saw you make a note on your pad three hours ago.
天啊  我真的惹你厌  是不是012---Man,I really bug you. Don't I?
哦  不  拜托012---Oh,no. Please..
我根本不在乎你  更别提讨厌你012---I don't care about you enough to bug me.

我的好朋友  加文·米奇012---my wonderful friend,Gavin Mitchell.
幸会  幸会012--- Pleased to meet you.  Pleased to meet you.
你会来参加瑞秋的派对吗012---Are you coming to Rachel's party?
哦  不不不不012---Oh,no,no,no,no.
加文去不成  他已经有计划了012---Gavin can't. He already has plans..
应该是要去看他妈妈012---most likely with his mother.
我不介意  我可以取消012---I don't mind. I'll cancel them.
我不想错过我秘书的生日012---I would never miss my secretary's birthday.
为什么你要邀请他012---Why did you invite him?
我无法忍受那个男的012---I can't stand that guy!
你看起来跟他很好啊012---You were being so nice to him.
我是装出来的012---I was faking it.
你难道看不出来我是装的吗012---Can't you tell when I'm being fake?
嘿  菲利浦先生  西装真帅012---Hey,Mr. Phillips. Nice suit.
抓到了  装出来的恭维话012---Right there. That was so fake!
我真不敢相信  你邀请了加文012---I still can't believe you invited Gavin.
他是我最不想见到的人012---He is just the last person I want to see.
"不用谢我帮你办派对"012---You're welcome for the party.
我很高兴你玩得开心012---I'm glad you're having a good time.
我希望他不要出现012---I hope he doesn't show up.
他当然不会  他讨厌我012---Of course he won't,the guy hates me.
是吗  什么012--- Does he?  What?
或许他一直惹你生气  是因为喜欢你012---Maybe he keeps bothering you so much because he likes you.
就像在小学一年级的时候012---It's like in first grade
斯库普·郎把我推倒在操场上012---when Skippy Lange would always push me on the playground
其实是因为他在暗恋我012---because he secretly had a crush on me.
莫妮卡  你以为斯库普喜欢你吗012---Monica,you think Skippy liked you?
亲爱的  所有的男生都在打赌012---Honey,all those boys had a bet
看他是不是有办法撂倒你012---to see if he could knock you over.
她睡了  我带她回去012---She's out. I'm gonna take her home.
好的  谢谢012---Okay. Thank you.
再见  甜心012---Bye,sweetheart.
男人都觉得她很有魅力  你有发现吗012---Do you see what all the guys see in her?
至少不会想踢她下床012---Wouldn't kick her out of bed.
我不可以再喝伏特加了012---No more vodka for me.
嘿  瑞秋012---Hey,Rach.
现在可以唱生日快乐歌了吗012---So can I sing "Happy Birthday" to you now?
当然可以 好的012--- Yeah,sure.  All right.
祝你生日...012---Happy birthday to....
待会见012---See you later.
瑞秋  有人送你鞋子012---Hey,Rach. Somebody got you shoes.
快给我看012---Give me!
哇哇  我的天啊  小心小心012--- Wow. Wow. Oh,my God!  Careful! Careful!
里面是我的老鼠宝宝012---These are my rat babies!
是啊  我们现在有老鼠宝宝了012---Yeah. We have rat babies now.
你带老鼠来参加我的生日派对012---You brought rats to my birthday party?
原来中风是这种感觉啊012---So this is what a stroke feels like.
我必须要带着他们  我们杀了他们的妈012---Well,I had to bring them. We killed their mother.
他们现在是我们的责任了012---They're our responsibility now.
你知道的  他们需要一直被照顾012---You know,they require constant care.
你应该知道的  瑞秋  你自己也是母亲012---You should know that, Rachel, you're a mother.
你把我女儿跟一只老鼠做比较012---Are you comparing my daughter to a rat?
不  是七只012---No. Seven rats.
我们应该带他们回家了012---We should take them home.
他们需要吃东西了012---We need to feed them.
你竟然要离开我的派对012---You're gonna leave my party
回去照顾一盒老鼠012---to take care of a box of rats?
嗯  我很抱歉  瑞秋012---Well,I'm sorry,Rachel,
但是我不像你  好吗012---but I'm not like you. Okay?
不是每个人都请得起保姆的012---Not everyone can afford help.
嘿  乔伊跟莫莉去哪了012---Hey,where the hell are Joey and Molly?
我要你看住他们的012---I asked you to watch them.
我很抱歉  我有点分心了012---I'm sorry. I got a little preoccupied.
听着  我们及时阻止他们  以免出事012---Look,we have to stop them before something happens.
我会追随你的  大哥012---Right behind you,big guy.
所以你瞧  莫莉  人们不了解012---So you see,Molly,what people don't understand..
演戏也是一门学科012---is that acting is a discipline.
需要很辛苦的学习和付出012---It takes a lot of hard work.
所以你是在哪里学的012---So where'd you study?
我没有上过大学012---I didn't go to college.
那  是从哪里学会演戏的呢012---No,where'd you study acting?
莫莉  演戏不是学来的012---Molly,people don't study acting.
莫莉  可以让我们谈几分钟吗012---Molly,do you mind giving us just a minute?
当然  我去看艾玛  谢谢012--- Sure. I'll go check on Emma.  Thanks.
马童就不能得到公主吗012---Will the stable boy never get the princess?
你以为你接下来会发生什么012---What do you think you were gonna do,
在我家沙发上跟她作爱012---have sex with her right here on my couch?
不  沙发皮会黏住我的屁股012---No. The leather sticks to my ass.
真不公平012---You know, This isn't fair.
你凭什么认为我会跟她上床012---What makes you think I'm gonna sleep with her..
然后就抛弃她呢012---and then blow her off,huh?
你们难道不能敞开心胸接受012---Can't you guys open your minds to the possibility
或许我是真的喜欢她012---that I actually like her..
而且想来段真感情012---and might want something real?
听着  事实上012---Look,the truth is,
自从瑞秋之后012---I haven't felt this way
我就没有对任何人有过这种感觉了012---about anyone since Rachel.
好吗  我以为我不会再爱了012---Okay? I didn't think I could ever love again.
少来了 乔伊012--- Come on!  Joe!
嗨  莫莉在吗012---Hi. Is Molly here?
在  请进  莫莉012---Yeah,yeah. Come on in. Molly?
嘿  各位  这位是塔比莎  嘿012--- Hey. Guys,this is Tabitha.  Hey.
明天见  好的012--- I'll see you tomorrow.  Okay.
乔伊  我觉得现在没问题了012---Well,Joey,I guess we have no problem.
就像是我的美梦终成真012---It's like my favorite fairy tale come true.
公主  马童和女同性恋012---The princess,the stable boy and the lesbian.
好了  你先泡配方牛奶012---Okay. Okay,you start preparing the formula..
我去换盒子012---and I'll start changing the box.
然后就送他们上床睡觉012---And then we gotta put them straight to bed.
我们什么时候变成了那种012---When did we become one of those couples..
生活围绕着老鼠转的小情侣012---whose lives revolve around their rats?
因为  他们现在是我们的责任了012---Well,you know what? They're our responsibility now.
好吧  这些老鼠是我们的责任012---Okay,fine. These rats are our responsibility.
要是他们交配后  变成上百只呢012---What happens when they mate and there are hundreds?
交配  他们是兄弟姐妹耶012---Mate? They're all brothers and sisters.
是啊  但是对老鼠可不是问题012---Yeah,not such a problem with rats.
他们是"爱上谁就上谁"的那种012---No,they're more of a "love the one you're with" kind of animal.
才不  真的吗012---No. Really?
哦  不要搞你妹妹啦012---Oh,my.. Get off your sister!
我的天  我们该怎么办呢012---Oh,my God. What are we gonna do?
我们有七只老鼠012---The.. We have seven rats.
如果七只老鼠的每一只012---So,what if each of them has seven rats..
都再生七只  那就是012---and then each of those has seven rats? That's like..
我都算不过来了012---That's math I can't even do!
我们该怎么办呢012---What are we gonna do?
嗯  我知道这听起来很疯狂012---Well,I know this is gonna sound crazy..
但我们可以不让这盒老鼠012---but we could not let the box of rats
毁了我们的生活012---ruin our lives.
是啊  好吧  我想你说的对012---Yeah,okay. I guess you're right.
好了  我们必须送走他们012---All right,so we should just give them away.
但要送给有小孩的好人家012---But to nice families with children
还要有低脂全麦饼干012---and reducedfat Wheat Thins.
那些是鲍伯最喜欢的012---Those were Bob's favorites.
会没事的012---It's gonna be okay.
你一定认为我疯了012---You must think I'm crazy.
不  我觉得你很善良012---No,I think you're sweet.
好吧  真的好难012---Good. This is just so hard.
我心里好难割舍012---It's hard for me to let them go.
我猜这让我联想起很多往事012---I guess it just brings back memories,you know..
就像我怀了我弟的三胞胎012---from when I gave birth to my brother's triplets
最后却抛弃了他们012---and I had to give them up.
我没有告诉过你那件事吗012---I haven't told you about that yet,have I?
谢谢你帮我办派对  亲爱的012---Thanks for the party,honey.
我应该帮你打扫吗012---Should I help you clean up?
不要  你的派对结束了 现在换我的012---No way. You had your party. Now I have mine.
一切还好吧  我只是有点累012--- Is everything all right?  I just get bummed..
生日结束了012---when my birthday's over.
至少有一件事值得你高兴012---Well,at least you have one thing to be happy about.
你办公室那个混蛋加文没有来012---That jerk,Gavin,from your office didn't show up.
是啊  他好讨厌哦012---Yeah,I hate him.
我们不是在说你  我们012---We weren't talking about you. We were..
好吧  来不及掩饰了  算了012---No. No way to recover. No. Okay.
一定很好玩  嗯  是的012--- Fun party.  Well,it was.
你本来会看到的  如果你不是出现在012---And you would have seen it if you didn't show up at..
九点半  天啊  派对太失败了012---9:30?! God! This party was lame.
再说一次  不用客气012---Again,you're welcome!
听着  我把礼物给你就走人012---Look,I'll just give you this and go.
你买礼物给我  为什么012---You bought me a present. Why?
让我解释一下生日派对是怎样的情况012---Let me explain how birthday parties usually work.
通常有礼物012---There are presents..
有蛋糕  或许还有第四个或第五个人012---and a cake,perhaps a fourth or fifth person.
好的  我012---Okay,I..
我送礼物给你012---I got you the present
弥补一下我对你的混蛋行为012---to make up for being such a jerk to you.
嗯  好的  真好012---Well,okay. Well,that's very nice.
而且你还写了卡片012---And you wrote a card.
"加文赠"  肺腑之言012--- "From Gavin."  I really mean it.
真美012---It's beautiful.
如果你不介意  让我来012---If you don't mind..? Let me.
真巧  非常合适012---Well,what do you know,it fits.
瞧  加文  你是可以当个好男人的012---See,Gavin. You're capable of being a nice guy.
为什么你要刁难我呢012---Why do you give me such a hard time?
我不知道012---I'm not sure.
莫妮卡好像认为012---Well,Monica seems to think
是因为你对我有感觉012---it's because you have feelings for me.
我是对你有感觉012---I do have feelings for you.
真的吗012---You do?
是的  我觉得你有点烦人012---Yes. I feel that you're a little annoying.
为什么  加文  为什么012---See,why? Gavin,why?
就在我要对你改观的时候012---Right when I'm about to change my opinion of you,
你就...012---you go and you..
你就这样做了012---And you do that.
嘿  听着  我有东西忘了带走012---Hey. Listen,I think I left something here.
是有人忘了这个  是你的吗012---Well,somebody left this. Is this yours?
不是  但是我蛮喜欢的012---No,but I like it.
有一只老鼠宝宝我忘了带走012---No,I think I left one of my rat babies.
没  我没有看到012---Well,no. I haven't seen it,
但是如果有  我会通知你的012---but if I do,I'll let you know.
老鼠宝宝  老鼠宝宝012---Rat baby! Rat baby!
老鼠宝宝  老鼠宝宝012---Rat baby! Rat baby!
或许就是他012---Maybe that's him.
-嘿  -嗯  好啦  当然012---- Hey.  - Yeah. Yeah, okay. Sure.
我们能不能谈谈012---Look, can we talk about
昨晚这里的发生的事012---what happened here last night?
行  先给我几秒钟012---Sure. Just give me a second
让我进入你那愤怒又诡异的状态012---to get all huffy and weird like you.
你敢相信某某人在昨天晚在这012---You believe that whoever did something last night
做了某某事要么没做某某事  有没有搞错012---did what they did or didn't do? Come on!
你真不了解我说的是什么012---Okay, you really don't know what I'm talking about?
-不知道  -好  昨天晚上的派对之后012---- No.  - Okay. Last night, after the party...
我看到瑞秋在你家的阳台上012---I saw Rachel kissing that jerk
亲她那个混蛋同事012---from her office out on your balcony.
在我家阳台  真的吗012---Our balcony? Seriously?
这可好玩了  我就和莫妮卡说012---That's so funny. I told Monica
我们应该在阳台上加个灯的012---we should put lights on our balcony
可她说不用  外面那么冷  没人会去012---and she said, ''No, no. It's too cold.
然后我说012---Nobody will go out there.'' And I said:
要是我们加个灯或许就有人会去了012---'Maybe if we put some lights out there they will.
对  我过来就是要和你谈这事012---Right, that's what I came over to talk about.
我看到瑞秋在你家阳台上亲了一个男人012---I saw Rachel kissing some guy.
虽然那里连灯都没有012---on your balcony, even though there were no lights!
那你要跟她谈谈吗012---So are you gonna talk to her?
为什么  为什么我要012---Why? Why should I?
如果她要找寻新生活  没关系012---I mean, if she wants to move on, that's fine.
这么说没关系  真有说服力012---You know when ''that's fine'' sounds true?
喷着口水用力吼012---When someone yells it and spits.
不  我认真的012---No, I'm serious.
如果她想要跟别人约会012---I mean, if she wants to date people,
没关系  我不在乎012---fine. I don't care.
但是至少她要跟我说啊012---But at least she could have told me.
我已经完全不顾个人生活012---You know, I've been putting my life on hold
集中全部精力在艾玛身上了012---and concentrating on Emma.
但如果她想要出去随便亲男人012---But if she wants to go out there kissing guys
那我也要去012---she barely knows, then so will I.
真好笑  罗斯是同志012---Very funny! Ross is gay!
没  很好  所以你也要有新的生活了012---No, no. Good, so you're moving on.
你准备怎么过新生活012---Do you have any idea where you're moving on to?
我机会多的很呢012---I've got plenty of opportunities.
就刚刚在咖啡厅里  有个女人对我笑呢012---Just now, there was some woman at the coffeehouse smiled at me.
还有一天在地铁  有个女人012---And then the other day on the subway, a woman
不小心  坐到我的手上了012---''accidentally'' sat on my hand.
老兄  别跟我炫耀你疯狂的单身生活了012---Dude, don't rub my face in your crazy single life.
还有  在学校有个人类学家012---And there's an anthropologist at school who totally came on to me
跨部门餐会的时候 不停勾搭我012---during the interdepartmental potluck dinner.
我为什么要结婚啊012---Why did I get married?

问你们一个问题012---Hey, let me ask you guys something.
我明天要拍新艺术照012---I'm having new headshots taken tomorrow.
摄影师说012---The photographer said she thinks
我应该修修眉毛012---I should have my eyebrows waxed.
男生修眉会不会很怪012---Is that weird for a guy?
-嗯  那要看情况  -什么情况012---- Well, it depends.  - On?
看他的变性手术做到哪个阶段了012---On how far along he is in the sex-change process.
不  我完全不同意012---No, I totally disagree.
我觉得男生那样做没有什么012---I think it's fine for a guy to do something like that.
尤其是演员012---Especially an actor.
我不是说你有那个必要  你的眉毛…012---I mean, not that you need to. Your eyebrows are....
你们别这样  别盯着我看  吓着我了012---Stop it, you guys. Stop staring, you're freaking me out.
你手指头也毛茸茸的012---Your knuckles are kind of hairy too.
天啊  现在我还要除这些毛吗012---Oh, man, now I have to get those done too?
哇  你要做的改造可不少啊012---Wow, talk about high maintenance.
你还不是染发012---You dye your hair.
-我是女人啊  -双重标准012---- I'm a woman.  - Double standards!
差点忘记 你今晚去迈克的钢琴酒吧吗012---Before I forget, are you coming to Mike's piano bar tonight?
只要不让我上台唱歌就去012---Only if I don't have to get up and sing.
但是大家都要唱歌啊  很好玩的012---But everybody sings. It's so fun.
上次有个可爱的老先生上台012---Last time, this adorable old man got up there,
歌词全忘了  糗呆了012---forgot all the words, flipped out
然后大家就嘘他下台  太好玩了012---and everyone booed him off the stage. It was so funny.
我不是很会唱歌012---Look, I'm not good at singing.
怎么啦  你害怕了012---Oh, what's the matter? You scared?
怕我唱的比你好吗012---You afraid I'm a better singer?
怕我会用歌声把你打得落花流水012---You afraid I'm gonna beat you at singing?
不是  这招对我没用012---Nope. Nope. It's not working on me.
哇  我一定是长大了012---Wow, I must be growing up.
好吧  就过来支持迈克就好了012---Okay, fine. Just please come and support Mike.
你不需要唱歌012---You don't have to sing.
所以我又不用唱歌012---So I don't have to sing,
而且还可以坐在那里评论别人012---and I can just sit there and pass judgment on others?
-还可以一边喝酒  -我要去012---- While drinking.  - I'm there.
你们好 我需要你们的帮忙012---Hi, you guys. Listen, I really need your help.
我想我做了一件很蠢的事012---I think I did something really stupid.
是  瑞秋  但至少结果还是很漂亮的012---Well, yes, Rachel, but you got something so beautiful out of it.
不  不是那件事  我昨晚亲了盖文012---No, not that. I kissed Gavin last night.
-我的天  -你亲了他012---- My God.  -You kissed him?
对  就在派对结束之后 我们在阳台上012---Yeah, it was after the party, we were on the balcony
等等  我一直都在家012---Wait, wait, wait. I was at home the whole time.
为什么没看到012---How did I miss that?
派对才刚结束 你可能正忙着烫平包装纸012---Well, it was the end of the party. You were probably ironing wrapping paper.
哦  没错012---Oh, yeah.
那你们怎么会亲起来的呢012---So how did you end up kissing?
我们单独在一起  然后他又很体贴012---We were all alone and he was being really nice...
然后又送我这条围巾012---and he gave me this scarf.
我以为你讨厌他012---I thought you hated him.
看来爱与恨之间只有一线之隔012---Well, there is a thin line between love and hate...
而结果  那条线就是这围巾012---...and it turns out that line is a scarf.
你想要跟这男的交往吗012---Are you thinking of starting something up with this guy?
不知道  太复杂了  我和他一起工作012---I don't know. lt's so complicated. I work with this guy.
我已经有小孩  还有罗斯012---I have the baby, and I have Ross.
我不知道该怎么办012---I don't know what to do.
而我再十分钟就要进办公室见到盖文了012---And I have to be at the office and see Gavin in 10 minutes.
听起来你应该想想012---Sounds like you need to think about
要怎么跟盖文说了012---what you want and talk to Gavin.
而且你一定得要跟罗斯谈谈012---And you definitely should talk to Ross.
或者…012---Or...
我可以打电话请病假  那就都不用管了012---...I could call in sick and not deal with it at all.
请了五个月的产假  才回去上了四天班012---Wow! Five months maternity leave, you're back for four days...
亲了一个同事  又要请病假012---kiss a co-worker and call in sick.
他们有你这个员工真幸运012---They are lucky to have you.
-嗨  -嗨012---- Hi.  - Hi.

好了  我们开始吧012---All right, let's just do this.
好的  我们等一下再上热蜡012---Okay, we'll get to the wax in a minute.
首先我要先拔一些杂毛  好吗012---First, I want to tweeze some of the strays, okay?
这可能会有点痛012---Now, this may sting just a little bit.
你随意  我可是一点都不怕痛的012---Please, I have an extremely high threshold

我没事  我没事  我没事012---I'm all right. I'm all right. I'm all right.
只是有点吓到  没什么012---It's just a bit of shock, that's all.
-但是我没事  你可以继续了 -好的012---- But I'll be fine. You can go again.   - Okay.
抱歉012---Sorry.

新生活进行得如何呢012---How's the moving on going?
不太好  地铁上又有个人坐到我的手012---Not well. I went on the subway again and someone did sit on my hand...
但是这个人既不是女性 也没有穿内裤012---but that person was neither female nor wearing pants.
或许你完全错估情势了  我是说你想想看012---Maybe you're going about this the wrong way. I mean, think about it:
单身白种男性  离婚三次012---Single white male, divorced three times,
有两个非婚生子女012---two illegitimate children.
你应该要自己心里有数的012---The personal ad writes itself.
真是好笑  是啊012---You know, that's funny. Yeah.
那你觉得你这辈子会找到工作吗012---So do you think you'll ever work again?
你在干嘛   你知道我们会斗个没完的012---What are you doing? You know I can only dish it out.
我不敢相信瑞秋就这样抛下过去012---I can't believe Rachel just moved on
而且还什么都没有跟我说012---and didn't say anything to me.
或许她并没有抛下012---Maybe she didn't move on.
或许那只是冲动之下吻的012---Maybe that kiss was just an impulsive,
过生日才发生一次的那种012---one-time birthday thing.
不  一个月以前  她还把电话号码012---No, a month ago,
留给一个在酒吧认识的男的012---she gave her number to some guy in a bar.
她有跟他出去吗012---Did she go out with him?
没有  他打电话来时012---No. When he called
我把留言扔了012---I threw the message away.
真是厉害啊012---The high road.
你知道吗  够了012---All right, you know what? Enough.
抱怨够了  我要展开新生活了012---Enough talking. I have to get moving.

因为我折起来放到裤子口袋里了012---Because I folded it up and put it in my pants pocket.
你没有去找过吗012---Do you not look there?
罗斯012---Ross.
我没有拿给你012---I never gave it to you.
为什么012---Why?
我不知道012---I don't know.
天啊  你知道吗  我不012---Oh, God, you know what? I don't
你以为你是谁呢  你有什么权利决定012---Who do you think you are? Who are you to decide
什么留言我该收  什么不该收012---what messages I should or should not get?!
-我是谁  -是啊012---- Who am I?  -Yes
我是在你去酒吧认识男人的时候012---I'm the guy who's taking care of our baby...
在家照顾我们的孩子的人012---while you're at bars meeting guys!
我真不敢相信012---I cannot believe you.
我还希望能够跟你  成熟地谈谈我们之间012---I actually came in here hoping to have a mature conversation with you about us.
但我不能跟会藏我留言012---But I can't do that with someone who hides my messages
还会带疯女人回我公寓的人谈012---and brings crazy women back to my apartment!
正常的人没有一个要跟我回来012---Hey, none of the sane ones wanted to come back with me!
这不是重点好吗  重点是012---That's not the point, okay? The point is
是你抛下我们的过去  而你却没有说012---you are the one who moved on and didn't tell anyone.
天啊  罗斯  这真是糟透了012---Oh, God, Ross, this is just so messed up.
我们是怎么了012---What is wrong with us?
大家知道我们的情况后  都会问012---When people hear about our situation, they ask:
你们住在一起  还不是夫妻012---''You live together, but you're not a couple,
但是你们又有小孩  不是很奇怪吗012---yet you have a baby? Isn't that weird?''
我会说  不会  我们都没问题012---And I say, ''No. It's not, because it works for us.''
但是你知道吗  是有问题的012---But you know what? This doesn't work.
事实上  还正好相反咧012---ln fact, this is the opposite of working.
的确如此012---Clearly.
你也知道012---And you know...
我们有说过只要一切没问题012---we said that we would live together
我们就会一直住在一起012---as long as this makes sense
然而  或许一切不再是没问题了012---and maybe this just doesn't make sense anymore.
是啊  或许不再是了012---Yeah, maybe not.
那你想要怎样呢012---So, what do you wanna do?
嗨012---Hi.
我跟艾玛可以过来住一阵子吗012---Can Emma and I live here for a while?
天啊012---God.
-当然可以  -谢谢你012---- Of course.  - Thank you.
你眉毛好奇怪012---Your eyebrows look weird.
耶利米书是只牛蛙012---"Jeremiah was a bullfrog.
它曾是我的好友012---Was a good friend of mine,
它的话我不曾听懂012---never understood a single word he said,
但我帮他喝了他的酒012---but I helped him drink his wine."
所以不管怎样  你都会自摸012---So you'll just touch yourself for anything, then?
-室友早  -早012---- Morning, roomie.  - Hey!
你今天早上终于记得穿衣服了012---You remembered to put clothes on this morning.
事不过五嘛012---Fifth day's a charm.
乔伊  能搬回来真好012---Oh Joey, it's so great to be back here.
你真帮了我跟艾玛一个大忙012---You're making it so easy on me and Emma.
你能回来也很好012---It's great having you back.
要待多久就待多久012---Stay as long as you want.
就是她什么时候才不会012---And when does she stop
整宿的哭呢012---crying all night?
你居然没有光着屁股012---Hey! You're not naked.
瑞秋  你今晚什么时候回来012---Rach, when will we expect to see you tonight?
我大概六点回来吧012---I probably be back around 6.
她在房间里呢  已经收拾好了012---But she's in the bedroom, all ready to go.
可她又睡着了  所以012---But she did fell back to sleep, so
她可能因为昨晚忙着012---She's probably exhausted from
制造美妙的哭声累坏了012---all that adorable screaming she did last night.
-再见  -再见012---- Bye.  - Bye.
希望艾玛没有给你带来太多麻烦012---Hey, I hope Emma isn't making it too hard on you.
没  一切都很好012---No, hey, it's been great.
我得跟你说  虽然瑞秋住在这012---I just want you to know that with Rachel staying here...
但是我之前对她的感觉  已经没了012---all my feelings from before are totally over.
即使本来还有012---And even if they weren't
当你看到一个女人用吸奶器012---when you walk in on a woman using a breast pump
-是啊  效果显着  -哇012---- Yeah, that'll do it.  - Wow!
那你怎样呢012---So how are you?
-不错啊  -真的吗012---- I'm okay.  - Really?
当然  要是问我  有没有希望过012---Sure. I mean, do I wish
可以和瑞秋幸福地生活在一起012---me and Rachel living together would have worked out?
当然有012---Of course. You know, I'm disappointed,
我只是有点失望  可毕竟这又不是离婚012---but it's not like it's a divorce.
事实上这…012---Well, actually it
这不是离婚  这不是离婚012---It's not a divorce. It is not a divorce!
反正我跟瑞秋  都应该过自己的新生活了012---Anyway, I think Rachel and I need to get on with our lives.
或许应该开始跟其他人交往012---Maybe start seeing other people.
哇  真的吗012---Wow. Really?
当然  为何不呢012---Sure, why not?
其实  你认不认识适合我的人012---In fact, if you know anyone that'd be good for me...?
当然  我认识很多女生012---Sure. I know lots of girls.
想到谁了  说个名字012---Any names come to mind?
还要名字012---Names?
《老友记》  第九季 第14集  相亲012---Friends S09E14 The One With The Blind Dates
我正要吃东西  你要吗012---I was about to eat. Want something?
有什么012---What you got?
我看看  有豆泥 胡萝卜泥…012---Okay, let's see, we got strained peas, strained carrots...
梅子泥  还没有试过这个012---strained plums. We haven't tried that yet!
好棒012---Goody!
谢谢012---Thanks.
跟瑞秋重新住一起感觉如何012---So how is it living with Rachel again?
当然  除了有很多好吃的之外012---I mean, apart from the great food?
很好  很好  只是...012---I'm fine, I'm fine. It's just....
她跟罗斯之间真的是很诡异012---It's just weird what's happening with her and Ross.
昨天他居然要我介绍女生给他012---Yesterday he asked me to fix him up with somebody.
瑞秋也问我有没有男生可以介绍给她012---Rachel asked me if I knew anyone for her too.
-他们为什么要这样呢  -不知道012---- Why are they doing this?  - I don't know.
他们彼此再适合不过了  真是神经012---They're so perfect for each other. It's crazy.
你知道什么才神经  这些罐子是怎样012---You know what's crazy?
才两口就没了012---These jars. It's like two bits in here?
真希望他们可以发现  他俩是天生一对012---I just wish they'd realize they should be together.
他们又住在一起的时候012---I know, I know. When they moved in together,
我以为事情就解决了012---I figured that's where things were headed.
我知道  他们应该是一家人012---I know. They should be a family.
结婚生更多的小孩012---They should marry and have more children.
是啊  还该把其中一个取名叫乔伊012---Yes. And they should name one of their kids Joey.
我或许不会有小孩012---I may not have kids.
总是要有人帮我把我的姓传下去012---Someone's gotta carry on the family name.
或许他们一旦开始跟别人约会012---You know what? Maybe once they start dating
知道别人是怎样的012---and see what's out there
他们就会发现彼此是多么适合012---they'll realize how good they are for each other.
因为他俩真是绝配啊012---Yeah, because it is slim pickings.
我昨晚约会的女生遭透了  讨厌012---I had this date last night. Yuck!
但我们说话小声点  她还在房间里012---But we should probably keep it down, she's still in the bedroom.
那我们该怎么办012---So, what are we gonna do?
难道真要帮他们介绍别人吗012---Are we just gonna set them up with people?
那只会使他们渐行渐远012---I know, that just pushes them further and further apart.
我知道要怎么做了012---I know what we can do.
我们帮罗斯跟瑞秋介绍糟糕的约会对象012---We could set Ross and Rachel up on horrible dates...
可以使他们意识到彼此才是归宿012---so they'll realize how good they are together.
-真是好计划  -没错012---- That's a great plan.  - Yeah.
你知道最棒的是什么吗012---You know what the best part of it is?
我终于可以用到计划笑声了012---I get to do my plan laugh.
停  不要那么大声  不要吵醒那个谁012---Okay, shh! Not so loud. We don't want to wake up
你们今晚没事  对吗012---Hi. You guys aren't doing anything tonight, are you?
你凭什么这么以为呢012---See, now, why would you assume that?
就因为我们是已婚吗012---Just because we're married?
我要让你知道 我们可是非常时髦又充实的012---I mean, I will have you know that we are very hip, happening people.
现在  不好意思012---Now if you'll excuse me,
我要继续读报上的讣告了012---I have to get back to reading the obituaries.
我就是问问  因为今晚我需要人帮我带艾玛012---I was just asking because I need someone to watch Emma tonight.
我们当然帮你带  你要干什么去012---Sure we'll do it. What are you up to?
菲比帮我安排一个约会012---Well, Phoebe set me up on a date.
我的天012---Oh, my God.
怎么了  有什么不对吗012---Why? What's the big deal?
我以为你跟罗斯是...012---I figured because you and Ross are--
是怎样  一年半前上过床吗012---What? Slept together a year and a half ago?
是啊  我已经好了012---Yeah, I'm all set.
我觉得你去约会是件好事012---I think it's great you're going on a date.
听起来很健康012---It sounds healthy.
你也有你的需要012---I mean, you have needs.
放手拥抱你的女性特质吧012---Embrace your womanhood.
你要找工作吗012---You want a job?
少看欧普拉  多投简历去012---Turn off Oprah and send out  resume.
我大概七点带她过来好吗012---I'll bring her by around 7, okay?
没问题012---That's perfect.
你们会过很开心的012---You guys are gonna have so much fun.
她现在正是可爱的时候012---She's at such a cute age.
几件事注意一下  现在她会吃固体食物了012---A couple things. Now that she eats solid food,
所以会按时排便012---she poops around the clock.
还有小心你的头发  她喜欢抓着不放012---And watch out for your hair because she likes to grab it.
她这个年龄阶段012---She's also in this phase
还会在你离开房间的时候拼命尖叫  但是...012---where if you leave the room, she screams, but....
谢啦  祝你们玩得开心012---Thanks, you guys. Have fun.
突然间  我希望读到讣告里有自己的名字012---Suddenly I wish I was reading my own name.
乔伊  我好兴奋012---Joey, hey. I'm so excited.
我给瑞秋找了一个最糟糕的男人012---I set Rachel up with the worst guy.
好的  他怎么样012---All right. Who is he?
是我按摩过的一个男客户  按摩时012---It's a guy I used to massage. By ''massage'' ...
我得按住他  让他不能转身露鸟012---I mean hold down so he wouldn't turn over and flash me.
等你听听我给罗斯介绍的谁再说吧012---Wait till you hear who I got for Ross.
喔  好啊012---Oh, yeah.
这个女人特别无聊  是个老师012---Okay. She's this really boring woman. She's a teacher.
老师012---A teacher?
她喜欢历史跟外国影片012---She's into history and foreign movies.
而且她还喜欢益智游戏012---And she loves puzzles.
拜托  谁会喜欢益智游戏呢012---Come on, who loves puzzles?
嗯  罗斯喜欢啊012---Well, Ross does.
你把计划给毁了012---You're ruining the plan!
乔伊  你这是要给他介绍完美伴侣呢012---Joey, you fixed him up with his perfect woman.
-我的天  你说的没错  -是啊012---- Oh, my God, you're right!  - Yeah.
她甚至还喜欢读书012---She even reads for pleasure!
你怎么会认识那种女人的012---How do you know a woman like that?
我就不能认识聪明的女人吗012---I'm not allowed to know smart women?
乔伊012---Joey?
我到图书馆里去上厕所认识的012---We met at the library. I went in to pee.
-那我们现在该怎么办呢  -嗯  好吧012---- So now what do we do?  - Well, okay.
我打电话跟她取消012---I'll call her and tell her the date's canceled
然后再找别人吧012---and find him somebody else.
要是我们不找别人呢012---What if we don't find him somebody else?
我们只跟女的说约会取消了012---We'll just tell her the date's off...
但是不告诉罗斯012---...but we don't tell Ross.
他就会在餐厅等着被放鸽子了012---He'll go to the restaurant and get stood up.
你好坏哦012---I hear that's bad.
太棒了  瑞秋会有个糟糕的约会012---So this is great. Rachel's gonna have a terrible date
罗斯被放鸽子012---Ross gets stood up,
之后  他们会意识到对方有多么好012---and then they'll realize how good they have it together.
是的  好计划012---Yes, the plan.
这不是圣诞老公公的计划012---It's not Santa's plan.
不  是这样…012---No, it's....
有点不太好玩了012---Yeah, you know, it's not that fun.
是不好玩  被我们弄僵了012---No, I think we killed it.
艾玛  看着我012---Emma? Emma, look at me!
那么  我要下楼待一会012---Well, I think I'll go downstairs for a while.
不要  没事的  我没有去012---No, no, no! It's okay! It's okay! I didn't go!
别哭  我是开玩笑的012---Don't cry, it's just a bit!
我是你的钱德勒姑父012---I'm your Uncle Chandler.
我只会搞笑啊012---Funny is all I have!
告诉你  我从明天开始到六号都在排卵012---Okay, just so you know, I'm gonna be ovulating from tomorrow until the 6th.
所以接下来的四十八小时012---So don't touch yourself
你不要自慰012---for the next 48 hours.
我不自慰的012---I don't do that.
我会试着克制自己012---I'll try to stop.
-你是说到六号吗  -是啊012---- Did you say until the 6th?  - Yeah.
今天就是六号012---Today is the 6th.
不  不是012---No, it's not.
是的  而且是2003年012---Yes, it's also 2003.
我的天  今天是六号了012---Oh, my God. Today's the 6th?
我可能已经停止排卵了012---I may be done ovulating!
我也可能在餐厅卖了有问题的肉012---I may have also served some very questionable meat at the restaurant.
-去做测试  看是不是还排  -好的012---- Go take the test, see if we're okay.  - Okay.
定力不错啊012---Tough crib.
其他的排卵测试棒呢012---Hey, where are all my ovulation sticks?
这只剩下一个了012---There's only one here.
我可能拿了几个012---I might have checked to see
测我是不是在排卵012---if I was ovulating a couple times.
钱德勒012---Chandler!
我没有工作  没事做很痛苦的012---I'm not working! There's not much to do around here!
不好意思012---Excuse me.
有没有女人在吧台那等人呢012---Is there a woman waiting at the bar?
中等身高  黑发012---Someone average height, dark hair?
可能在玩猜谜游戏012---Or perhaps doing a puzzle?
只有一个中国醉汉012---There's a drunk Chinese guy.
如果我一小时之后还在这里012---Well, if I'm still here in an hour,
给他上杯酒  算我账上012---buy him a drink on me.
您要不要再点一杯红酒012---Can I get you another glass of wine?
不知道  我不想喝到醉醺醺的  然后...012---I don't know if I should. I don't want to be drunk when I...
独自回家012---...go home alone tonight.
被放鸽子了  是吗012---Got stood up, huh?
没有什么  只不过是跟陌生人约会012---It's no big deal. It's just a blind date.
你是担心那个女的012---Are you worried your date came,
进来看你一眼就走了吗012---saw you and left?
没有012---No!
还好  我还在排卵012---We're okay. I'm still ovulating.
很好  因为今天下午四点的时候012---Oh, good, because as of 4:00 this afternoon,
我没有在排卵012---I am not.
那我们搞起来吧012---So let's do this.
-我想我没办法  -不是吧012---- I don't think I can.  - Oh, come on.
我知道你不再是十八岁了012---I know you're not 18 anymore,
给它一点时间嘛012---but give it a minute.
-因为艾玛在  -天啊  艾玛012---- Because of Emma.  - Oh, my God, Emma.
亲爱的  我忘记你在这里了012---Oh, sweetie, I forgot you were here.
说的对  我们不能这么做012---You're right, we can't do this.
也不能把她单独留在这里012---We can't leave her alone.
对不起012---Sorry.
除非…012---Unless...
或许我们可以在这里做012---maybe we do it here.
她这个年纪懂什么012---I mean, how much can she even be aware of at this age?
她已经能意识到  我们有没有离开房间012---She's aware when we leave a room.
或许她也会注意到我们…012---She may notice if we start...
在滚床单012---...canoodling in it.
滚床单012---Canoodling?
嗯  我总不能在一个娃娃面前说…012---Well, I can't say hump or screw...
做爱或是上床吧012---in front of the B-A-B-Y.
我想  在婴儿面前做爱…012---I don't know, I guess having sex in front of a baby...
-并没有那么...  -可怕  吓人012---- isn't so....  - Horrifying? Scarring?
让人蹲监狱的错012---Something people go to jail for?
-大概你说得对  -大概我说得对012---- I guess you're right.  - You guess I'm right?
那次住在宾馆的时候012---When we at that bed-and-breakfast,
你不肯和我做爱012---you wouldn't have sex with me
是因为你觉得012---because you thought
有只鹿站在窗外盯着看012---a deer was staring through the window.
什么变态混蛋012---Well, what kind of a sick bastard
会想在一只鹿面前做爱啊012---wants to do it in front of a deer?
哇  看上去都挺好吃012---Wow, everything looks so good.
我要点个鸡肉012---I think I'm gonna have the chicken.
我必须要说012---I just have to say this.
你可真美012---You're really beautiful.
嘴真甜  谢谢你012---Wow, that's very sweet. Thank you.
我长得有点可笑012---I'm kind of funny-looking.
-什么  -我是说  拜托012---- What?  - Look, I mean, come on...
你可不是我可以高攀的起的012---...you're way out of my league.
这里人人都看得出来012---Everybody in here knows it.
我敢说那边那个人  正在这么说012---I bet that guy over there is probably saying:
"她怎么会跟他约会呢"012---''Why's she out with him?"
"一定是他很有钱"012---"He must be rich.''
可是  我没钱012---Well, I'm not.
你想吃点什么012---What do you think you want to order?
我好想吃这家的鸡肉012---I'm real excited about that chicken.
我也不风趣012---I'm not funny, either.
所以如果你是在想012---So if you were thinking,
"他长得不怎么样"012---"Well, he's not that good-looking..."
"但也许他是个幽默的人"012---"but maybe we'll have some laughs,''
那你就错了012---that ain't gonna happen.
别这样  史提夫012---Well, come on, Steve,
别打断我紧张的苦笑012---let's not rule out nervous laughter.
等等  菲比告诉我012---Hey, now, wait a minute, Phoebe told me
你自己有家餐厅  很了不起啊012---that you owned your own restaurant. That's impressive.
已经没了  因为吸毒012---I lost it to drugs.
我现在卖印的T恤012---I silk-screen T-shirts now.
真的啊  工作怎么样012---Really? What's that like?
做一个你痛恨  又赚不到钱的工作012---It's really fulfilling doing something
真是非常充实啊012---you hate for no money.
没错  我没有钱  我不风趣012---That's right. I have no money, I'm not funny...
我还住在一个  只有一室的房子里012---I live in a studio apartment
还是跟两个男人合租的012---with two other guys.
我还很确定  我有不育症012---And I'm pretty sure l'm infertile.
别这样  别这样  史提夫012---Now, come on. Come on, Steve.
你肯定有对自己满意的地方012---There must be something that you like about yourself.
我倒是挺满意我的头发012---I do like my hair.
真的吗012---Really?
-哈啰  -菲比  是我012---- Hello?  - Phoebe, it's me!
我一定要追杀到你  然后把你给剁了012---I'm going to hunt you down and kill you.
嘿  瑞秋012---Hey, Rach!
这真是史上最烂的约会012---This is the worst date ever!
你怎么给我介绍这么个怪胎012---How could you set me up with this creep?
听着  你说的可是012---You know, you are talking about
我最要好  最要好的朋友012---one of my dear, dear friends.
我才不管  这人简直就是个恶梦012---I don't care. This guy is a nightmare.
好了  他只在嗑完药的时候012---All right, so he gets a little crazy
才有点失常012---when he's stoned.
他没嗑药012---He's not stoned.
他有出去抽烟吗012---Did he go out for a cigarette?
-有啊  四次  -我亲爱的甜姐儿瑞秋012---- Yeah. Four times.  - My dear, sweet Rach.
我们的计划奏效了012---Well, our plan is working.
瑞秋现在如坐针毡012---Rachel's having a miserable time...
而罗斯被人放了鸽子012---and Ross is stood up somewhere at a restaurant

她睡着了  钱德勒012---She's asleep. Chandler?
你在做什么呢012---What are you doing?
艾玛也这样做啊012---Emma was doing it.
她睡着了012---She's asleep.
她睡了  那就表示我们可以…012---She's asleep. That means we can....
是的  但是我们动作必须要快012---Yes. But we have to be fast.
好的  我尽量012---Oh, okay, I'll try.

你好吗  你好吗012---How are you? How are you?
你的保姆们呢  嗯012---Where are your babysitters, huh?
卧房的门怎么关了012---Why is the bedroom door closed?
在照顾哇哇的时候012---You can't have S-E-X
怎么能上床啊012---when you're taking care of a B-A-B-I-E.
有个坏消息  那个中国人走了012---I've got bad news. The Chinese guy left.
命里有时终须有012---If it was meant to be,
命里无时莫强求012---it's meant to be.
被放鸽子又能怎么样012---Look, you got stood up. Who cares?
让我们来好好招待你012---We're gonna show you a good time.
你就坐着享受吧012---Sit and relax.
事实上  我要免费招待您一个012---In fact, let me bring you
蟹肉饼开胃菜吧012---a crab-cake appetizer on the house.
哇  免费的蟹肉饼吗  真是周到012---Wow, free crab cakes? Well, that's nice.
虽然我本来希望今晚可以嘿咻一下的012---Although I was hoping to have sex tonight.
只要蟹肉饼就行了012---Just the crab cakes.
你在干嘛  是要让他留下来吗012---What are you doing? Are you trying to get him to stay?
你不能这样做012---You can't do that.
不要多管闲事好吗012---Just get out of here, okay?
很抱歉  这是怎么回事012---I'm sorry, what's going on?
服务生们都在打赌012---Okay, the waiters have a little pool going.
赌你会等多久012---We have a bet on how long it'll take
才会放弃回家去012---before you give up and go home.
什么012---What?!
你竟然拿我的痛苦来赢钱012---You're making money off my misery?
只要你待到九点二十的话  我就赢了012---Well, if you stay till 9:20, I am.
太离谱了012---This is unbelievable.
我一生从未被如此羞辱过012---I have never been so insulted in my life.
现在  如果你帮我把蟹肉饼打包012---Now, if you'll wrap up my free crab cakes,
我就马上离开012---I'll be on my way.
真是奇怪012---Well, that was weird.
你倒是很大声  反而我倒是挺快的012---You were loud and I was fast.
我觉得我们这一次会成功012---I think we may have really done it this time.
都等不及去作验孕测试012---I wish l didn't have to wait to take a pregnancy test.
你可能需要再多买一些012---You may want to get some more of those too.

我的天  艾玛呢  艾玛呢012---Oh, my God, where's Emma? Where's Emma?
别问我012---Don't ask me.
我跟你一起在里面滚床单呢012---I was in there canoodling you.
一定是瑞秋提早回来012---Okay. Okay. I'm sure that Rachel came home early
把艾玛带回去了012---and picked up Emma.
你去对面看看  我来打电话给她012---You go look across the hall, and I'll call her cell.
你最好祈祷我有怀孕012---You better hope we're pregnant...
因为无论如何012---because one way or another,
我们都得有个孩子还给瑞秋012---we're giving a baby back to Rachel!
不敢相信我在你面前哭了012---I can't believe I'm crying in front of you.
你一定觉得我很可悲012---You must think I'm so pathetic.
不  不  不  我欣赏会哭的男人012---No, no, no, I admire a man who can cry.
-真的  -别碰我的外套012---- Really?  - Don't touch my coat.
对不起  我有电话012---Sorry, that's my phone.

-没有  -我的天  那…012---- No.  - Oh, my God! Then....
感谢上帝  艾玛  原来你在这里012---Thank God! Emma, there you are!
"原来你在这里"是什么意思012---What? What do you mean, ''there you are''?
她刚才在哪里012---Where was she?
我们在玩躲猫猫012---We were playing peekaboo.
她爱死我的激情演出了012---She loves it when I'm dramatic.
你为什么要带走她012---Why the hell did you take her?
因为你们两个在做爱012---Because you two were having sex!
-不  我们没有  -别对我说谎012---- No, we weren't.  - Don't you lie to me.
我从钱德勒的头发就可以看出来012---I can tell by Chandler's hair.
你也太懒了  就不能有一次在上面吗012---You are so lazy. Can't you get on top for once?
好啦  好啦  我们是在做爱012---All right. All right, we were.
我们是要努力怀孕012---We're trying to make a baby.
莫妮卡正在排卵012---Monica's ovulating.
艾玛就在隔壁012---It's unacceptable that you'd have sex
你们居然在里面做爱  不能接受012---with Emma in the next room.
我必须要告诉瑞秋这件事012---I'll have to tell Rachel about this.
拜托不要  她会杀了我们的012---Please don't. She will kill us.
我一定要  除非…012---Hey, I gotta. Unless....
除非怎样012---Unless what?
除非你们把第一个小孩012---Unless you name
取名叫乔伊012---your first-born child Joey.
什么  为什么012---What? Why?
我可能永远都不会有小孩012---Hey, I may never have kids...
总是要有人帮我延续香火012---and somebody's gotta carry on
用我家的姓吧012---my family name.
你姓崔比安尼012---Your family name is Tribbiani.
我差点就被你骗到了012---You almost had me.
听着...012---Look...
虽然我知道问也是白问012---I think I know the answer to this question,
但是…012---but...
你想要跟我做爱吗012---would you like to make love to me?
真的  真的不想012---Really, really not.
只不过是问问012---It's just as well.
反正也起不来012---It doesn't work anyway.
好吧  那就这样  晚安  史提夫012---All right, well, that's good to know. Good night, Steve.

我刚度过糟糕的一晚012---I just had a rough night.
要蟹肉饼吗012---Crab cake?
发生什么事了012---Well, what happened?
跟你聊这件事真的是有点奇怪 但是…012---This is kind of weird to talk to you about this, but--
莫妮卡跟我说你去约会了012---Monica told me you had a blind date.
-是啊 -我也是012---- Yeah.  - I did too.
但是如果对方没有出现012---But is it technically a date
那到底算不算是约会呢012---if the other person doesn't show up?
你是不是觉得  她看到你就走了012---Oh, no. Do you think she walked in, saw you and left?
大家为什么一直这样说012---Why does everyone keep saying that?
我可以让你好过点012---If it makes you feel any better,
我真希望我的对象没有出现012---I wish my date hadn't shown up.
那么糟吗012---That bad?
他是做T恤的012---Well, he makes T-shirts for a living...
而且他认为送这样的礼物给我是…012---...and he thought it would be appropriate to give me...
很适当的012---this.
"女性身体检查官"012---''Female Body Inspector''?\NFBI:也是联邦调查局Federal Bureau of Investigation的缩写
这是什么尺寸的012---What size is that?
等等  所以他们要012---Now wait a minute. So they're gonna
把第一个孩子取名叫乔伊012---name their first child Joey?
那我要怎样才能012---How do I get them
让他们把第二个孩子012---to name the next one
以我的名字取名呢012---after me?
很简单  你只要012---It's easy. You just walk in
在他们做爱时走进去就行了012---on them having sex.
那他们已经欠我三个菲比了012---Oh, so they owe me, like, three Phoebes.
我的天  瞧  那是罗斯跟瑞秋012---Oh, my God! Look, it's Ross and Rachel!

我们几个月以来的第一次约会012---The first dates we've had in months,
结果却都这么惨012---and they were both such disasters.
你想啊  有点奇怪...012---You know, it is weird...
菲比帮我安排一个很烂的约会012---...that Phoebe would set me up on a date that was awful...
而在同一晚012---...on the same night
乔伊帮你安排了一个012---Joey set you up on a date
根本没有人出现的约会012---that didn't even show.
等一下012---Wait a minute.
你不会认为这是故意的吧012---You don't think it was intentional?
我是说  这实在太愚蠢了012---I mean, that's just stupid.
我们真是天才012---We're geniuses.
瞧瞧他们  合得不得了012---Look at them! They're really bonding.
再度坠入爱河了012---They're falling in love all over again.
他们看到我们了012---Oh, they see us.
他们看起来很生气012---Oh, they look mad.
他们知道了012---They figured it out.
他们过来了  快跑012---They're coming. Run!
-跑去哪  -墨西哥012---- Where?  - Mexico!
谁敢相信她们居然还没有出现012---Can you believe they're still not here?
是啊  四人约会012---I know. A double blind date
我们竟然一起被放鸽子012---and we both get stood up.
太倒霉了012---What are the chances?
对啊  我好难过啊012---I know, I'm so bummed.
现在可以上免费的蟹肉饼了吗012---Could we have our free crab cakes now?
-什么  -我们被放鸽子了012---- What?  - We've been stood up.
我们想要免费的蟹肉饼012---And we want our free crab cakes.
你们俩  不用装了012---Guys, give it a rest.
今晚没有人拿你们打赌012---Nobody's betting on you tonight.
不过我们倒是在赌012---Although we do have a pool going to see
看那个男的多久才会哭出来012---how long it takes that guy to cry.
我的手好肥012---I have such fat hands!
各位   我有个好消息  猜猜看012---Guys! Guys! I've got great news. Guess what.

除了不用跟你上床012---except less sex with you.
你去那里做什么工作012---What do you think they'll have you do there?
这只是个培训项目012---It's a training program,
但是结束之后012---but they hire the people
他们会雇佣他们喜欢的人012---they like.
太棒了012---That's great!
但无可避免的012---Yeah, I mean, there's probably gonna be
会有些让人讨厌的无聊工作012---some grunt work...
一个大男人还帮别人端茶倒水012---which will stink. A grown man getting people coffee

罗威  是你吗012---Lowell, is that you?
菲比012---Phoebe?
我的天啊012---Oh, my God!
不可思议  我的天012---Unbelievable! Oh, my God!
抱歉  罗斯012---l'm sorry. Ross,
这是我流浪街头时的老朋友  罗威012---this is my old friend, Lowell, from the streets!
罗威  这位是罗斯012---Lowell, Ross.
罗斯  很高兴认识你012---Ross, nice to meet you.
是啊  真是高兴012---Yeah, a real pleasure.
真是好久了  哇  真久012---lt's been so long! Oh, so long.
不敢相信你还在干这行012---l can't believe you're still doing this.
我知道  但是我戒烟了012---l know. But l quit smoking.
好极了012---Good for you.
看起来你过得不错012---You look like you're doing well.
我猜你已经金盆洗手  不抢劫了012---l guess your mugging days are behind you.
我的天  菲比  你以前抢劫012---Oh, my God. Phoebe, you used to mug people?
对不起  罗斯  我们老朋友正在叙旧呢012---Excuse me, Ross, old friends catching up.
试演怎么样012---How'd the audition go?
他们要我再去  但是…012---They want to see me again, but...
李奥·海斯不喜欢我012---...Leonard Hayes did not like me.
怎么了012---What happened?
他说我迫切感不够012---He said l wasn't urgent enough.
我演的是水平的012---Everything l did was horizontal,
应该要垂直一点012---and l should be more vertical.
他说我应该不要想太多012---He said that l should think less.
目前为止你做的不错012---Well, so far so good.
亲爱的  我老了（我回来了）012---Honey, l'm old!
怎么了012---What's wrong?
跟其他的实习生比  我太老了012---I am so much older than these other interns.
拿什么和他们争012---I can't compete with them.
你是年纪比较大一点没错012---So you're a little older.
往好处想  你有更多的生活经历012---Look at the positive. You have all this life experience.
是的  但生活经历012---Yes, but I don't think life experience
帮不了我  这个012---is gonna help me with these.
它们就像着火了012---Wow! It's like they're on fire!
这是什么012---What are they?
样品鞋012---Prototype sneakers.
要我想出销售策略  我想不出来012---I need ideas on how to sell them. Which I can't do...
因为但凡有自尊的成年人012---...because no self-respecting adult
都不会穿这种东西的012---would ever wear these.
我给你五百块  这鞋我买了012---I'll give you $500 for them.
我应该怎么办呢012---What am I supposed to do?
别这样  运动鞋很容易啦012---Come on, sneakers are easy.
你也总穿啊012---You wear them all the time.
首先  它们现在不叫运动鞋了012---They're not called sneakers anymore.
改叫"霹雳鞋"或是"滑轮鞋"012---They're called ''kicks'' or ''skids.''
我还听到有人说"轮鞋"012---I think I heard somebody say ''slorps.''
鞋的底部有凸出的轮子012---They've got wheels that pop out from the bottom
让你可以滑来滑去012---so you can roll around...
因为显然  走路太耗费体力了012---because apparently walking is too much exercise.
"孩子们  孩子们012---''Kids! Kids!
一路滑进儿童肥胖区吧  "012---Roll your way to childhood obesity!''
你可以帮我卖这些东西吗012---Would you help me try to sell these?
好的  有没有想过用大波霸呢012---Okay. Have you considered using a girl with huge knockers?
那不会是他们想要的012---That's not what they're looking for.
那对我很有用哦012---Hey, that would work on me.
你想我为什么要买婷美呢012---Why do you think I buy Mrs. Butterworth's?
你都猜不到刚才怎么了012---You'll never guess what just happened.
-我和菲比被打劫了  -你们没事吧012---- Phoebe and I got mugged!  - Are you okay?
没事  因为菲比认识那个劫匪012---Yeah. Phoebe knew the mugger.
你怎么会认识劫匪呢012---How do you know a mugger?
不好意思  除了我们六个人之外012---I'm sorry, I have friends
我还有其他朋友012---outside the six of us.
你知道他们是怎么认识的吗012---Know how she knew him?
因为菲比以前也是劫匪012---Because Phoebe used to mug people.
真的吗012---Seriously?
我不觉得这是什么光彩事012---Well, I'm not proud of it,
但是你们知道的012---but, you know...
当我流落街头的时候012---...when I was living on the street
也需要钱买食物什么的012---and I needed money for food and stuff....
菲比  这真是太恐怖了012---Phoebe, that is awful.
我不像你们那么有钱  好吗012---I wasn't rich like you guys, okay?
我没有金汤匙也没有飞天马012---I didn't eat gold and have a flying pony.
我生活得很艰苦012---I had a hard life.
我妈被毒贩子给杀了012---My mother was killed by a drug dealer.
你妈是自杀的012---Your mother killed herself.
她自己就是毒贩子012---She was a drug dealer.
幸好他和菲比认识012---Anyway, it was a good thing she knew him.
否则我会让他死得很难看012---I was about to do some serious damage.
好吧012---Okay.
一定勾起你的痛苦回忆了  罗斯012---This must have brought back some bad memories for you, Ross.
-为什么  -罗斯小时候被抢过012---- Why?  - Ross was mugged as a kid.
-是吗  -是的012---- You were?  - Yeah.
弱小的心灵受到了严重的打击012---And it was pretty traumatic.
就在圣马克漫画店外面012---It was outside St. Mark's Comics.
我正在忙着012---I was minding my business,
看蜘蛛侠又惹上什么麻烦了012---seeing what kind of trouble Spider-Man was into.
是神奇女侠012---Wonder Woman.
反正  我正去面包店的路上012---Anyway, I was heading towards this bakery...
帮某人买几十个甜蛋糕012---to pick up a couple of dozen linzer tortes for someone...
然后不知道从哪里冒出来的恶棍012---when out of nowhere, this thug with a pipe jumps out
拿着一根管子跳出来说...012---and says:
"把钱给我  笨蛋"012---''Give me your money, punk!''
我的天啊012---Oh, my God.
我知道  最糟糕的是012---I know. And the worst part was,
他们抢走了我的背包012---they took my backpack...
里面有我自己创作  亲手绘制012---...which had all the original artwork
我自己的漫画012---I did for my own comic book,
《科学小子》012---Science Boy.
对啊  他的超能力是什么来着012---Oh, yeah! What was his super power again?
一个对知识超级渴望的超人012---A super-human thirst for knowledge.
我要赶去上课了012---I better get to class.
你还有其他朋友012---Are there any more of your friends
需要我小心的吗  菲比012---I should look out for? Phoebe.
没有  事实上  你离简街远点012---No. Actually, you might want to stay away from Jane Street.
那是刺客乔的地盘012---That's where Stabby Joe works.
-我想我们有麻烦了  -怎么了012---- I think we have a problem here.  - What?
在我当劫匪的时候012---Back in my mugging days,
圣马可漫画店是我的地盘012---I worked St. Mark's Comics.
-然后呢  -管子是我用的武器012---- Yeah?  - A pipe was my weapon of choice...
少年和漫画书呆子  都是我的目标012---...and preteen, comic-book nerds were my meat.
所以呢012---So?
曾经有个小孩012---There was one kid
背包上有张贴纸  写着012---who had a sticker on his backpack that said:
-地质学酷毙了   -地质学酷毙了012---- Geology rocks!  - Geology rocks!
我的天啊012---Oh, my God!
我知道  我抢了罗斯012---I know! I mugged Ross!
-你迟到了  -我知道  我很抱歉012---- You're late.  - I know. I'm sorry.
我可以先跑去上个厕所吗012---But can I just run to the bathroom?
不行  李奥是不等人的012---No. Leonard doesn't wait.
但是我快尿出来了012---But I am bursting with Yoo-hoo!
乔伊  来吧012---Joey, here we go!
我们开始   快一点012---Let's go. Very quickly.
我真的想要...012---I really need--
现在就开始  快点012---We must go now, quickly.
-好  是的  -好了吗012---- Yeah. Yes, sir.  - Ready?
你怎么还在这里012---What the hell are you still doing here?
你知道的012---I think you know!
你这个该死的混蛋012---Oh, you sick bastard!
这都是你造成的  你知道吗012---I  am what you made me! Know what?
什么012---What?
我可以现在就走012---I could go right now.
那就走  走啊012---Then go. Go!
我不能  我想走  但是我不能走012---Oh, I can't. I want to, but I can't!
停  演得好012---Cut. That was good!
非常精彩  这就是我想要的012---Very good. You did everything I asked.
是吗012---I did?
是的  而且你把这种扭曲的特质012---Yes. Plus which, you've got this, I don't know, this squirmy quality
加入到这个角色中  简直出乎意料012---you bring to the character I couldn't have imagined.
我们接下来可以这样012---Here's what we're gonna do:
明天过来参加最后的试演012---Come back tomorrow for the final callbacks.
就照你今天这样演  但是012---Do all of this, what you got going now. But you know what?
加强  再加强  你可以吗012---More. More. Can you do that?
当然  我没时间说谢了012---Sure. I don't have time to say thank you
真的得走了012---because I really gotta go!
瞧瞧他  还那么入戏  我喜欢他012---Look at that! Still in character. I like him.
我播了种  无法言喻012---I plant seeds. I can't explain it. I don't know.
你在做什么012---Hey. What are you doing?
在试穿跑鞋012---Putting on the sneakers...
融入年轻人的世界012---to get in the young mindset,
看会不会激发出什么灵感012---see if it sparks anything.
-发出什么了  -你听这个012---- Oh, anything yet?  - Yes, how's this?
"此鞋让你的脚012---''They're so uncomfortable,
不舒服到像是被踢蛋蛋"012---it's like getting kicked in the nuts for your feet.''
你们可能很纳闷我在做什么012---You're probably wondering what I'm doing.
不  看起来很正常012---No, that seems about right.
昨天试演的时候我尿急012---Yesterday at my audition, I really had to pee.
很明显  夹着尿让我演技爆发了012---Apparently, having to pee makes me a good actor.
可以参加最后试演012---I got a callback,
所以能喝的我都喝了  对了012---so I'm drinking everything. Oh, by the way...
我们冰箱里面的蛋奶实在太好喝了012---that eggnog in our fridge was great!
乔伊  那是婴儿食品012---Joey, that was formula.
我们一定要多买一些012---We gotta get more of that.
这东西还不赖012---These aren't half bad.
你应该要向拉夫·劳伦推荐012---You should suggest these to Ralph Lauren.
第一  那很蠢012---Okay, first of all, that's stupid.
第二  他们不允许我跟拉夫说话012---Second, I'm not allowed to talk to Ralph.
好的  我已经觉得年轻多了012---All right. I feel younger already.
我的臀部好像摔伤了012---Yeah, I think I broke my hip.
嘿  你来了012---Hey, you!
嘿012---Hey.
嘿  课上得怎样012---Hey. How was class?
从来没人问过我的课  出什么事了012---No one asks me that. What's wrong?
-没事  就是很想知道而已  -哦012---- Nothing. I really want to know.  - Oh.
我们针对更新世012---Well, there was actually a rather lively discussion
讨论得相当热烈012---about the Pleistocene--
好了  我不需要这样折磨自己012---All right, nothing is worth this.
我有件事要对你坦白012---I have a confession to make.
你记得小时候打劫你的女生吗012---Okay, you know that girl that mugged you when you were a kid?
你说什么呢  那不是女生012---What are you talking about? It wasn't a girl.
是个魁梧大汉012---It was this huge dude.
你用说谎  我知道是个十四岁女生012---You don't have to lie anymore. I know that it was a 14-year-old girl.
不  不是012---No, it wasn't.
是  是的012---Yes, it was.
你认为我打不过一个十四岁女生吗012---You don't think I would have defended myself against a 14-year-old--?
"把钱给我  笨蛋"012---''Give me your money, punk!''
我的天  那是你012---Oh, my God, it was you!
我不敢相信  是你抢劫了我012---I can't believe it. You mugged me?
是的  我非常抱歉  罗斯  对不起012---Yeah. And I'm so, so sorry, Ross. I'm sorry.
但如果你再想一下  这其实挺不错的012---But, you know, if you think about it, it's kind of neat.
我的意思是012---I mean, well,
我常常觉得自己像是个局外人012---it's just that I've always felt kind of like an outsider.
你们几个人彼此都认识特别久了012---You know, the rest of you have connections that go way back...
而现在  你跟我也有老交情了012---...and, you know, now you and I have a great one.
这并不是好事012---It's not the best!
我知道  请原谅我012---I know. Please forgive me.
我不知道该说什么012---I don't know what to say.
你什么都不用说012---There's nothing you can say!
那是我这辈子最耻辱的事012---That was the most humiliating thing ever.
甚至比...012---Even more humiliating than--
我们不要说了012---Let's not do this!
然后在广告结尾012---And then, at the end of the commercial,
女孩们走出浴缸012---the girls get out of the hot tub...
开始一起亲热012---...and start making out with each other.
有趣012---That's interesting.
只有一件事012---Just one thought:
你没有提到鞋子012---You didn't mention the shoes.
下一个是谁  钱德勒012---Who's next? Chandler.
开始的画面  一个男人穿上这双鞋012---You start on the image of a guy putting on the shoes.
他大约是我这个年纪012---He's about my age.
-你的年纪  -对啊012---- Your age?  - Aha!
他在街上滑着  接着失去了控制012---He's rolling down the street and he starts to lose control.
或许他跌倒了012---Maybe he falls.
或许还受伤了012---Maybe he hurts himself.
就在这时候012---Just then,
一个小孩  穿着这双鞋  飞快地滑过去012---a kid comes flying by wearing the shoes.
他边笑边从这个男人身上跳过去012---He jumps over the old guy and laughs.
接着广告词出现…012---And the line reads:
"成人不宜"012---''Not suitable for adults.''
钱德勒  这个很棒012---Well, Chandler, that's great.
谢谢你  先生012---Thank you, sir.
或是  比我小两岁的人012---Or, man who's two years younger than me.
你们瞧  这才是清晰的卖点012---You see, that has a clear selling point.
抓住了我们主要客户群的心态012---It appeals to our key demographic.
你是怎么想出来的012---How did you come up with that?
我不知道  我不知道012---I don't know! I don't know!
我就是试着用年轻的心态去思考012---I was just trying to get into a young mindset,
然后灵感涌动012---and stuff started to flow.
太棒了  做得好012---That is great. Good work.
谢谢012---Thank you.
那我们大家明天见012---We'll see all of you tomorrow.
天一冷  臀部就疼012---The cold weather hurts my hip.
罗斯  我知道你还在生我的气012---Hey, Ross. I know you're still mad at me,
但我可以跟你谈一下吗012---but can I just talk to you for a sec?
当然  说吧  哦  等等012---Sure, go ahead. Oh, sorry.
当然  说吧012---Sure, go ahead.
我真的想要再次跟你道歉012---I just really wanted to apologize again.
而且让你看些012---And also show you something
你会觉得很兴奋的东西012---I think you'll find very exciting.
哦  我的天啊012---Oh, my God!
"街头收集来的垃圾"012---''Crap from the street!''
听着  罗斯  这箱子里012---Look, Ross. In this box...
都是我抢来012---...are all the things I got from mugging
觉得太特别而不想卖掉012---that I thought were too special to sell...
或是  抽掉的东西012---or smoke.
反正  我找了一下  找到了...012---Anyway, I was looking through it, and I found...
《科学小子》012---Science Boy.
哦  我的天啊012---Oh, my God!
我没想到还会再见到它012---I never thought I'd see this again.
全部都在了012---It's all here!
你为什么这些年还留着它012---What made you save it all these years?
可能是我觉得它很棒012---I guess I just thought it was really good.
或许有一天会值钱012---And maybe it would be worth something one day.
你真的认为《科学小子》值得收藏012---You really thought Science Boy was worth saving?
是的  但是你应该知道012---Yeah. But you should know
我还留了一罐凡士林012---I also have a jar of Vaseline
跟一副猫头骨012---and a cat skull in here.
不管  这还是很惊喜012---Still, this is amazing!
我的天  谢谢你  菲比012---Oh, my God. Thank you, Phoebe.
不用客气  谢谢你的《科学小子》012---You're welcome. Thank you for Science Boy.
我从他身上学到很多012---I learned a lot from him.
你不用客气012---You're welcome.
我需要答案012---I need an answer!
我无法告诉你我不知道的事012---I can't tell you something I don't know.
你知道的012---You know!
我不知道012---I don't know!
我现在就要答案012---I need an answer now!
你要答案吗  答案就是...012---You want an answer? The answer is....
她从未爱过我  她只爱你012---She never loved me. She only loved you.
你一直都知道  而你却没有告诉我012---You knew this all along and you never told me?
居然没告诉我012---You never told me?
我永远都不会原谅你012---I can never forgive you.
也永远都不会原谅我自己012---I can never forgive you myself.
我没有活下去的必要了  砰  结束012---I have nothing to live for. Bang! And scene!
精采绝伦012---Absolutely amazing.
这个角色是你的了012---The part is yours.
谢谢  我现在得走了012---Thanks! Now I really gotta go.
不  等等  恭喜了  你办到了012---No, wait! Congratulations! You did it.
你办到了  现在可以放轻松了012---You did it. You can relax now. Yeah.
哇  有线电视帐单真贵012---Wow! That's a big cable bill.
你没有工作012---You don't have a job,
倒很敢付钱看色情片啊012---but you have no problem ordering porn.
在星期六下午012---On a Saturday afternoon?
我也在家耶012---I was in the house!
嘿  菲比有没有提到...012---Hey. Phoebe didn't by any chance mention that--
她就是那个打劫你的彪形大汉吗  有012---She was the huge guy that mugged you? Yeah.
我知道了  你有没有告诉...012---I see. You didn't happen to tell--
我们认识的每个人吗  我有012---Everybody we know? Yeah.
太好了  谢谢012---Great. Thanks.
你看过我们的银行对帐单了吗012---Have you seen our bank statement?
不会出错了吧012---Can this be right?
就是嘛  天啊012---I know. God,
除了我小时候  双层夹心饼上市那会012---I haven't seen my savings take a hit like this...
我的存款就没这么少过012---since I was a kid and they came up with Double Stuf Oreos.
我们的存款哪去了呢012---What happened to all of our money?
我不清楚他们做了什么012---I'm not sure exactly what they did...
但是我倾向于责怪安然公司倒闭案012---but I'm inclined to blame Enron.
大概因为你在做实习工012---I guess with you doing the internship,
所以我们有些入不敷出012---we're spending more than we're bringing in.
是啊  或许我应该辞掉012---Yeah, maybe I should quit
找个有薪水的工作012---and get a job that pays.
可你总算找到你喜欢的工作了012---But you're finally doing something that you love.
我不能要求你放弃的012---I mean, I can't ask you to give that up.
不过你喜欢做的工作是挖金子012---Although it would be nice if the thing that you loved
那就好了012---was finding gold.
我觉得我们太小题大作了012---You know, I think we're making too big a deal out of this.
我们这个月迟些付账单012---We'll pay our bills late this month.
下个月我们就节省一些开销012---Next month we'll cut back on a few things.
而且或许我们可以变换一下012---And maybe we start eating out of Joey's refrigerator
到乔伊家的冰箱找食物012---for a change.
你是大厨012---You're a chef.
用苏打粉跟啤酒你会做什么菜012---What can you make out of baking soda and beer?
最糟糕的情况下012---Worst-case scenario is,
我们只好找我父母借钱012---we borrow some money from my parents.
不可以  而且我们也不借钱012---No, and we're not borrowing money.
-为什么   -我们是宾家人012---- Why not? -We don't do that.
宾家人从不跟人借钱012---We are Bings.
我爸唯一教会我的事  就是012---If there's one thing my father taught me, it was...
去别人家泳池之前012---well, to always knock
一定要先敲门012---before going into the pool house.
还有  永远都不要向人借钱012---The other thing is, never borrow money.
我不知道你这么有自尊012---I had no idea you had this much pride.
没错  我有  我是你男人012---That's right, I do. I am your man.
我会让我们度过难关的012---I'm gonna get us through this situation...
就算你要加倍努力地工作012---even if it means you working twice as hard.
《老友记》  第九季 第16集  隆胸记012---Friends S09E16 The One With The Boob Job
-我要回去了  -为什么012---- I'm gonna go.  - Why?
我有好几天没有回家了012---I haven't been home in days,
而且我需要多拿几件衣服012---and I need to get more clothes.
你不用回去012---You don't have to go.
我有衣服可以给你穿012---I have something that'll fit you.
我穿女生的紧身衣  是在逗你012---I put that tube top on as a joke.
我想要你留下来012---I want you to stay.
我也想要留下来012---I want to stay too.
但是这几条内裤我都穿遍了012---But I've got as much use out of these boxers as I can.
-要不反过来再穿呢  -已经反过了012---- Why don't you turn them inside  - Done it.
我几个小时之后就回来012---I'll be back in a couple of hours.
好吧  我会想你的012---All right. I'll miss you.
我也是012---Me too.
你知道吗  我刚惊觉到一件事012---You know what? I just realized something.
我不想回家012---I don't want to go home.
太好了  好的  我去拿紧身衣012---Great! Okay, I'll go get the tube top.
不  我的意思是012---No, no, what I mean is...
我不喜欢回去自己的公寓里012---I hate going back to my apartment now.
一方面是因为  我住的房间又小又乱012---Partly because I live above a known crack den...
但是  主要是因为012---...but, you know, mostly because when I'm there,
我回去的时候  真的好想你012---I really miss you.
所以...012---So...
我们同居好不好012---do you want to move in together?
哇  迈克·汉尼根012---Wow, Mike Hanigan...
你倒真有两把刷子  让女生说"好耶"012---...you sure know how to make a girl say ''Hell, yeah.''
那我们要这样做吗012---So we're doing it?
好啊  就这样  让我们住在一起012---Yeah, let's do it. Let's live together.
我们真的要同居了吗012---We're really gonna move in together?
是啊012---Yeah.
我一直都想要跟男生同居012---I've always wanted to live with a guy.
袜子捡起来012---Pick up your socks.
把马桶圈给我放下来012---Put down the toilet seat.
不  我再也不能再做爱了012---No, we are not having sex anymore.

-嘿  乔伊  -嘿012---- Hey, Joey.  - Hey.
听着  我要你跟我保证012---Listen, I need to know that what
一会我要拜托你的事情012---I'm about to ask you...
你永远都不会告诉钱德勒012---will never get back to Chandler.
如果说我  没有想过那件事012---I'd be lying if I said I hadn't
那是骗你的012---thought about it myself.
但是钱德勒是我最好的朋友012---But Chandler is my best friend.
那是不对的012---It would be wrong.
感觉应该不错  却是不对的012---Good, but wrong.
好的  首先  感觉会是棒翻天012---Okay, first of all, it would be great.
但那不是我说的事  我要跟你借钱012---But that's not what I'm here to talk to you about. I need to borrow money.
哦  不好说  莫妮卡  你知道012---Oh, I don't know, Monica. You know
借钱给朋友不是什么好事012---lending friends money is always a mistake.
但是钱德勒借过你钱啊012---But Chandler lent you money.
而他也会告诉你  那不是什么好事012---And he would tell you it was a mistake.
别这样  我只是...012---Come on, I just....
需要付房租跟一些帐单012---I need it for some rent and some other bills.
多少钱呢012---Well, how much?
两千块012---Two thousand dollars?
两千块012---Two thousand dollars?
你以为我是谁  肥皂剧明星吗012---What do you think I am, a soap opera star?
-是啊  -没错  我就是012---- Yeah.  - That's right, I am.
-嗨  你们好  -嘿012---- Hi, you guys.  - Hey.
袋子里是什么012---What's in the bag?
艾玛已经开始会爬了012---You know how Emma started crawling?
我觉得这个地方  对婴儿很不安全012---I realized that this place is very unsafe for a baby...
所以我去店里买了些东西012---...so I went to the store
可以保护婴儿在公寓里活动012---and I got some stuff to baby-proof the apartment.
哦  天啊  保护婴儿012---Oh, God, baby-proofing.
有什么了不起的012---Why is it such a big deal now?
我小的时候  经常发生012---You know, when I was a kid, it was like:
"哎呀  乔伊跌下楼梯了"012---''Whoops, Joey fell down the stairs.''
或者  "糟糕  乔伊又电到自己了"012---Or, ''Whoops, Joey electrocuted himself again.''
你要找人帮忙装这些东西吗012---Anyway, are you going to get a handyman to install this stuff?
不  我自己来就行了012---No, I was just gonna do it myself.
-你要自己来  -是啊  不行吗012---- You're gonna do it?  - Yeah. Why?
你觉得女人做不来吗012---You don't think a woman can do this?
女人可以  你不行012---Women can. You can't.
莫妮卡  请你告诉乔伊  他是猪012---Monica, will you please tell Joey that he is a pig.
你是猪  而你做不来012---You're a pig. And you can't do this.
什么012---What?
别这样  我自己都找到五金店了012---What? Come on, I found the hardware store all by myself.
五金店不就在街角嘛012---The store's right down the street.
街角就有五金店啊012---There is a hardware store right down the street?
嘿  各位  我们有好消息要宣布012---Hey, you guys? Okay, we've got great news.
菲比跟我要搬到一起了012---Phoebe and I are moving in together.
恭喜012---Congratulations.
好兴奋  我从来都没跟男生同居过012---I know, it's so exciting. You know, I've never lived with a guy before.
其实跟女生同居是一样的012---Well, it's just like living with a girl,
只是他们不会偷用你的化妆品012---only they don't steal your makeup.
除非他们扮演012---Unless they're playing
"我要有妹妹  她长什么样"012---''This Is What My Sister Would Look Like.''
我妹长得不是很可爱012---Yeah, she's not so cute.
我去洗手间012---I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
上完把马桶坐垫放下来012---Well, you put down the toilet seat.
是的  亲爱的012---Yes, dear.
那是你们在玩的游戏吗012---Is that a bit you guys do?
是啊  我们在模仿你们俩个012---Uh-huh. We're playing you two.
我们才没有那样012---We don't do that.
告诉她  我们没有012---Tell her we don't do that.
是的  亲爱的012---Yes, dear.
不敢相信你们要同居了012---I can't believe you're moving in together.
真替你们高兴012---I'm happy for you guys.
我听到婚礼进行曲了012---I hear wedding bells.
莫妮卡  别急好吗012---Monica, slow down, okay?
我只是很兴奋要跟他同居了而已012---I'm just excited to be living with him.
你知道的  我是说  我不知道...012---You know, I mean, I don't know...
我能预见  有天跟迈克结婚吗012---...can I see someday being married to Mike?
是的  当然012---Sure. Yeah.
我可以想像012---I could picture myself
穿着婚纱走在红毯上012---walking down the aisle in a wedding dress...
婚纱主要突显我的胸部012---.that highlights my breasts
但是是很高雅的爆乳012---in an obvious yet classy way.
但问我想不想要012---But do I want
在康乃狄克州的好学区附近012---that house in Connecticut near
有所房子...012---the good schools...
迈克可以和我012---...where Mike and I could
送我们的小苏菲  跟小迈克去上学012---send little Sophie and Mike Jr.?
哦  我的天  我愿意012---Oh, my God, I do.
我不晓得你是这么传统的人012---I had no idea you were so conventional.
我也没想到  大概我是的012---I know. I guess I am.
我的天  开着沃尔沃012---Oh, my God, load up the Volvo,
我就是中产阶级妇女了012---I want to be a soccer mom.
你准备好要走了吗012---You ready to go?
当然好了  新室友012---Yeah, you bet, roomie.
你是说"新郎"吧012---Don't you mean ''groomie''?
-你们在说什么  -拜托012---- What are you talking about?  - Please.
这些家伙  我们都还没一起住012---These guys. We haven't even moved in yet,
他们就要我们选结婚用的瓷器了012---and they have us picking out china patterns.
结婚用的瓷器012---China patterns!
很容易嘛  还说"你不行..."012---This is easy. ''Can't do this....''
哇  还真的咧  就是不行012---Wow, seriously. Can't do this.
-嘿  乔伊  -嘿012---- Hey, Joe.  - Hey.
听着  我需要你帮个忙012---Look, I need to ask you a favor,
而且不能跟莫妮卡说012---and we can't tell Monica anything about it.
我以为你们之间没有秘密012---I thought you guys didn't have secrets.
官方说法上是那样没错012---That will remain the official party line.
莫妮卡跟我  有一点点经济上的问题012---Look, Monica and I are having a little financial trouble.
是啊  我知道012---Yeah, I know.
什么  你怎么知道的012---What? How do you know?
我猜的  你知道的012---I just figured it out, you know?
你没有工作  而且现在经济又很萧条012---I mean, you're not working, and the economy is bad.
哦  对012---Oh, right.
这是我反应最快的一次了012---That is the fastest I have ever thought.
反正...012---Anyway...
我需要跟你借点钱012---I need to borrow some money.
当然可以  多少钱  两千块吗012---Oh, sure. Yeah, how much? Two thousand dollars?
是的  正是两千块012---Yes, $2000 exactly.
你是怎么知道的012---How did you know that?
我知道你之前赚多少钱012---I know how much you used to make,
而且我也知道你们的房租012---and I know how much your rent is.
哦  好的012---Oh, okay.
我真是天才012---I am on fire.
听着  你真好012---Listen, this is really nice.
你是不是开了一张012---Did you write a check
两千块的支票给莫妮卡012---to Monica for $2000?
莫妮卡跟你借钱了012---Did Monica borrow money from you?
好像是012---Kind of.
我不敢相信她竟然这样做012---I can't believe her.
她跟你说我们经济出问题了吗012---Did she tell you we were having money problems?
不  不是为了你们的经济问题012---No, no, no. It wasn't because of your money problems.
是她自己的东西012---It was for something for her.
什么012---What?
很私人的东西012---Something personal.
她要买两千块的东西012---What would she get for $2000
还不能告诉我012---that she wouldn't tell me about?
打扰一下012---Excuse me.
隆乳手术012---Boob job.
隆乳手术  她根本不需要啊012---A boob job? She doesn't need that.
太疯狂了012---That's crazy.
不算太疯狂  好吗012---Well, it's not that crazy, okay?
把咪咪变小才叫做疯狂012---Making them smaller, that would be crazy.
嘿  我想要问你012---Oh, hey, I wanted to ask you about
关于莫妮卡"新郎"的玩笑012---Monica's little ''groomie'' joke.
我想大家会笑012---Well, I think the reason people laughed is
是因为"新室友"和"新郎"音近012---that it's a play on the word ''roomie.''
我听得懂这个笑话  真是高深啊012---I get the joke. Sophisticated as it was.
不  我要说的是...012---No, the thing I want to say is....
或许我们之前就应该先谈过012---Maybe we should've talked about this before.
我们同居之后012---Us living together,
你没有期望我会求婚吧012---you're not expecting a proposal, right?
-哦  不  一点也没有  -好的012---- Oh, no, no. Not at all.  - Okay.
我们才刚搬进来一起住012---We're just moving in right now.
将来怎样顺其自然012---We'll see where it goes.
对  这就是个问题012---Yeah, well, that's the thing.
对我而言  这已经是我的极限了012---For me, it's as far as it can ever go.
你是什么意思012---What do you mean?
听着  菲比  我...012---Look, Phoebe, I....
我非常爱你  但我不想再结婚了012---I love you very much. But I never want to get married again.
只是我的第一次婚姻太...012---It's just, my first marriage was...
太糟糕了  我已经对婚姻失去信心了012---you know, such a disaster that I kind of lost faith in the whole idea.
有那么糟吗012---Was it that bad?
到最后...有一次012---At one point, near the end...
她故意便便在我的...012---she deliberately defecated on my
哦  那真糟012---Okay, well, that's bad. Yeah.
但你不认为012---But don't you think it might be different
换个人会不一样吗012---with someone else? Perhaps...
或许是一个012---a blond
会在厕所便便的金发女郎012---who always uses the toilet?
除了便在海里的那次012---Except for once in the ocean.
听着  不是结婚对象是谁的问题012---Look, it's not about who I would marry.
我第一次结婚的时候012---I was certain the first time I got married
我坚信会白头到老  但我错了012---it'd last forever. I was wrong.
但是  只是012---But, it just
菲比  问题不在你012---Look, Phoebe, it's not about you.
我只是再也不想结婚了012---I just never want to get married again.
我很抱歉012---I'm sorry.
你介意吗  如果你介意的话012---Are you okay with that? If not,
或许我们同居  不是个好主意012---maybe us moving in together isn't the best idea.
可以  哦  我当然不想结婚012---No. Oh, I definitely don't want to get married.
我只想确定你也不想结婚012---I just wanted to make sure you didn't want to, too.
因为如果我们住在一起了012---Because if we move in
你再开始改变主意...012---and you start changing your mind...
我们就有麻烦了  先生012---...there is gonna be hell to pay, mister.
相信我  我永远不...012---Trust me. I will never
好的  我知道了012---Yeah, I get that. Yeah.
嗨  最后你决定请人来帮忙了012---Hi. So you gave in and decided to call someone?
是啊  不知道我当时在想什么012---Yeah. I don't know who I was kidding.
我连筷子都不会用012---I can barely use chopsticks.
-都装好了  -非常感谢012---- You're all set.  - Oh, thank you so much.
等等  你忘了你的...012---Wait. You forgot your...
玩具012---...game.
谢谢你012---Thank you.
嘿  瑞秋012---Hey, Rach.
我身材完美的老婆在这呢012---There she is, my perfectly proportioned wife.
别看我  我从来没有听懂过他的笑话012---Don't look at me. I never get his jokes.
-谢谢你  -不  不  别谢我012---- Thank you?   -No, no. Don't thank me.
谢谢你  你知道吗012---Thank you. Do you know
我希望你不要改变任何一点012---there is not one thing I would change about you?
一点都不要变  而且特别是...012---Not one single thing. And definitely not...
那两点012---two single things.
好的  你真的很怪012---Okay, you're being weird.
你想上床吗  还是做了什么错事012---Do you want sex, or did you do something bad?
不  我就是爱你这模样  我爱你的012---No. No. No. I just love the way you look. I am warm
身材012---for your form.
传统上  一般都是说 "你很漂亮"012---Okay, you know the old classics like, you know, ''You look nice''?
这句话还适用012---They're still okay.
但是"你很漂亮"可能只是代表012---But ''you look nice'' could mean that I'm saying,
"你的脸蛋看起来漂亮"012---''Your face looks nice.''
我想要赞美你的身体012---I want to compliment your body.
我是说  我一点都不想它改变012---I mean, I wouldn't change it at all.
而且更详细地说  就是012---And more specifically,
我不想让任何部位变大012---I wouldn't want anything to get any bigger.
-好的  -我是说...012---- Okay.  - I mean...
你也不会想要我身体的某部份变大012---...you wouldn't want any part of me to get any bigger,
不是吗012---would you?
此题不用回答012---Don't answer that.
我还以为那老兄不可能更怪了012---Just when you thought that dude couldn't get any weirder.
你觉得他  为什么要担心我会变大012---Why do you think he was so worried about me getting bigger?
我不知道  这事儿从何而起啊012---I don't know. I mean, what brought that on?
我的天  我们正努力要怀孕...012---Oh, my God. You know what, we're trying to get pregnant...
所以他可能  很怕我的身材会变形012---...so he's probably starting to freak out that my body's gonna change.
你认为是这样吗012---You think that's what it is?
你也听到了012---You heard him.
"不要变大  你很完美了012---''No bigger. You're perfect.
不要再变大了"012---Just don't get any bigger.''
天啊  他听起来就像是012---My God, he sounded just like
我高中的摔角教练012---my high-school wrestling coach.
我必须要跟钱德勒谈谈012---I'm gonna have to talk to Chandler.
是啊  如果你不去  我去012---Yeah. If you don't, I will.
你的身材必然会走样012---Of course your body's gonna change.
你的胸部会变大012---Your breasts are gonna get bigger...
你的屁股会变大012---...your ass is gonna get bigger...
你的膀胱会失控012---.you're gonna lose bladder control.
我的天  真是奇妙的过程啊012---God, it's just such a magical time.
听着  我想向你请教关于婚姻的事012---Hi. Listen, I wanted to ask you something about marriage.
太好了  现在你是跑来取笑我吗012---Oh, great. Now you're seeking me out to make jokes?
大家在一起的时候被取笑012---I mean, I can see
我可以理解012---if we're all hanging out,
但是跑到我家来...012---but to come to my home....
不  我真的想知道你的意见012---No, I really want to know how you feel about it.
为什么012---Why?
迈克永远不想要结婚012---Mike doesn't ever want to get married.
-永远吗   -永远012---- Never? - Never.
哇  你还要跟他同居吗012---Wow. Are you still gonna move in with him?
我想啊  但是我要你告诉我012---I want to, but I wanted you to tell me
结婚真的没什么大不了012---that marriage really isn't that big a deal.
没结婚也不必后悔012---You know, that I won't be missing out on anything.
因为婚姻烂毙了012---That marriage stinks.
是啊  婚姻烂毙了012---Yeah, marriage stinks.
如果你想看到012---I mean, if you want to see
男人变肥  女人不再除毛012---a man gain weight and a woman stop shaving
就叫他们结婚吧012---get them married.
那不是你真正的感觉  对吧012---That's not how you really feel, is it?
不是  我很抱歉012---No, I'm sorry.
我知道这不是你想听到的话012---I know it's not what you want to hear,
但是我没有办法说谎  我喜欢结婚012---but I can't help it. I love marriage.
真的吗  你这个"离婚专家"012---Seriously, you? ''Divorce-o''?
如果你要帮我取绰号012---If you have to call me a name,
我比较喜欢   "罗斯  离婚王"012---I'd prefer ''Ross, the Divorcer.''
听起来较酷012---It's just cooler.
听着  我知道我的婚姻并不成功012---Look, I know my marriages didn't exactly work out...
但我喜欢  两个人可以如此的投入012---but, you know, I loved being that committed to another person.
在卡罗尔变成女同性恋之前012---And Carol and I had some good times
我们有过许多快乐的时光012---before she became a lesbian.
之后还有一次012---And once afterward.
反正  很抱歉012---Anyway, I'm sorry.
没关系  这是你的真实感受012---It's okay. That's how you feel.
但是  别这样  住在一起也很棒阿012---But, come on, I mean, living together will be great.
我是说你们会很快乐的012---I mean, you guys have so much fun.
而且你爱着迈克012---And you love Mike.
我是很爱迈克012---I do love Mike.
是啊  不是吗012---Yeah, see?
你之前也很期待同居的012---And you were so excited about moving in together before...
而且你知道吗  期待是对的012---...and you know what, you should be.
这是很大的一步012---It's a big deal.
是啊  我想你说的对012---Yeah, I guess you're right.
是啊  谢谢  真有帮助  谢谢012---Yeah, thanks. This helped. Thanks.
离婚王拯救众生012---The Divorcer to the rescue.
-并没有比较酷  -我听到了012---- It's not cooler.  - Yeah, I just heard it.
瑞秋012---Rach?
瑞秋012---Rachel?!
所以我想做什么喜欢的事情都不行吗012---So I can't do anything I like?!
嘿  瑞秋012---Hey, Rach.

大男人012---Fascist.
我的胸部会变大的012---My breasts are gonna get bigger
不管你喜不喜欢012---whether you like it or not.
而且不只是我的胸部012---And it's not just my breasts.
我的屁股也会变大012---My ass is gonna get bigger too.
你的屁股012---Your ass?!
而且如果她的手脚也变大  别太惊讶012---And don't be surprised if her hands and her feet get bigger too.
-他们也会吗  -这就像整套的一样012---- They do that?  - It's kind of a package deal.
天啊  为什么012---God, why?
为什么你要对自己做这种事呢012---Why would you want to do that to yourself?
我以为这是我们俩都想要的012---I thought it was something that we both wanted.
如果这对你那么重要  胸部那块012---If it means that much to you,
我或许可以释怀012---I may be able to get onboard with the boobs...
但是大屁股还有大脚丫012---but the giant ass and the big clown feet?
哦  天啊  钱德勒012---Oh, my God, Chandler.
如果你连这个都受不了012---If you can't handle this,
那你到了医院要怎么办...012---what will you be like in the hospital...
加上流血和尖叫声012---...with the blood and screaming
还有那个  从她身体挤出来的小小人012---and the little person that's shooting out of her?
什么012---What?
乔伊  你为什么要跟钱德勒说012---Joey, why did you tell Chandler
莫妮卡要去做隆乳手术呢012---that Monica was getting a boob job?
因为她是要啊012---Because she is.
钱德勒知道我跟你借钱了012---Chandler knows I borrowed the money.
为了要做隆乳手术012---For your boob job.
-乔伊  -结束了012---- Joe... - It's over.

嘿  嘿  你们觉得这样如何呢012---Hey. Hey, what do you guys think about this:

是啊  帮助很大012---Yeah, you were helpful.
-是啊  很谢谢你  -很好  很好012---- Yeah. No, thank you.  - Good. Good.
因为我越想越觉得...012---Because the more I thought about it, the more I realized...
婚姻对你而言  不见得是必经之路012---...I don't think marriage is necessarily the right path for you.
你是什么意思012---What do you mean?
我知道那天在咖啡馆的时候...012---I know the other day in the coffeehouse...
你很沉醉于当中产阶级妇女什么的012---you were all caught up in the whole soccer-mom thing...
但是那是真的你吗012---...but is that really you?
你可以想像自己开着沃尔沃吗012---I mean, can you honestly picture yourself in a Volvo?
富豪汽车是太有棱有角了012---They are awfully boxy.
我是说  婚姻对你而言  是很无趣的012---I mean, I don't know, you'd be so bored with marriage.
那太中规中矩了012---I mean, it's so normal.
是啊012---Yeah.
嘿  需要帮忙吗012---Hey, can I help?
我们爬了四层楼012---Well, we climbed up four flights of stairs,
好不容易通过狭窄的通道012---maneuvered a narrow hallway...
躲过一只狂犬病斗牛狗012---dodged a rabid pit bull.
但是最后这三尺路才是最崎岖的012---But these last three feet are where it gets really tricky.
有时候你的话真伤人012---You know, sometimes your words, they hurt.
嘿  你们要把这个放哪呢012---Hey, where do you guys want this?
是啊  快点  因为真的很重012---Yeah, seriously, because this is really heavy.
不是我  我只是假装扶着012---I mean, not for me, because I'm only
但他们几个真的快被压死了012---pretending to hold it, but for these guys.
最后再问你一次结婚的事012---Just one last time on the marriage thing.
没有再考虑的空间吗012---There's no wiggle room?
一点都没有012---None at all?
没有  你也不想结婚  不是吗012---No, but you don't want to get married either, right?
没错012---Right.
不过  我是真的想要结婚012---Except that I do want to get married.
不能在楼下卸货前先谈这个吗012---Couldn't have had this conversation down at the truck, huh?
什么  你想要结婚012---What? You want to get married?
总有一天012---Someday.
得了疝气了...012---And...hernia.
我从未有过正常的生活012---I haven't had a normal life.
而我也从没有觉得缺失过什么012---And I never felt like I was missing out on anything.
但是现在我觉得012---But it feels like now it's my turn
该轮到我拥有正常的东西了012---to have some of the regular stuff.
你为什么不早说呢012---Why didn't you say something before?
我之前不确定我有多想要012---I didn't know how much I wanted it.
而且我爱你  我想要跟你一起住012---And I love you, and I wanted to live with you.
我也想跟你一起住  我们就搬到一起吧012---I want to live with you too. I mean, let's do that.
但是我做不到012---But I don't think I can.
当我不清楚未来会怎样时012---It was okay to move in
是可以搬到一起012---when I didn't know what was gonna happen.
但已经知道是毫无未来了012---But I can't move in knowing nothing is
我做不到012---ever gonna happen.
我们可以至少先试试同居吧012---Can we at least try living together?
你或许会改变对婚姻的想法012---You might change your mind about marriage.
你会改变你的想法吗012---Are you gonna change yours?
不会012---No.
我也不会012---Me neither.

再见012---Goodbye.
-再见  迈克  -拜  迈克012---- Take it easy, Mike.  - Bye, Mike.
我很遗憾  菲比012---I'm so sorry, Pheebs.
我们都很不好受012---We're all sorry.
往好处想012---Look on the bright side.
至少你可以远离那张丑椅子了012---At least you won't have to live with this ugly chair.
这个就是你的  对不对012---That was here already, huh?
我爱你012---I love you.
我办到了  我办到了012---I did it! I did it!
太好了012---All right.
最好拿多一点012---I'd better take all I can carry.
谁知道下次能不能打得开呢012---Who knows when I'll be able to get in here again, huh?
可以走了吗012---You ready to go?
让我先把这个弄完012---Let me just finish this.

你可以发布状态012---You can post messages for people,
让大家知道你的近况012---let everyone know what you're up to.
太好了  一个更快速方式012---Oh, great. A faster way to tell people
昭告大家  我失业又没小孩012---that I'm unemployed and childless.
知道大家的近况挺有意思的012---It's actually interesting to find out what people are doing.
记得艾卓雅·里奇吗012---Remember Andrea Rich?
不肯跟你上床的那个高个子女生吗012---That tall girl that wouldn't sleep with you?
她的网络公司倒闭了012---Well, her Internet company went under,
还在游艇事故里失去一只耳朵012---and she lost an ear in a boating accident.
我敢说她现在一定会跟你上床了012---Bet she'd sleep with you now.
不行  我已经发邮件问过她了012---No, I already e-mailed her.
让我看看  你给自己写的什么012---Let me see what you wrote about yourself.
古生物学博士  有两个小孩012---Doctor of paleontology, two kids.
等等  你跟卡罗尔分开的原因012---Wait a second. You split with Carol
是因为兴趣不同吗012---because you had different interests?
我认为你跟她分开的原因012---I think you split with Carol
是因为某个兴趣相同012---because you had one very similar interest.
我等一下再写好了  去拿件外套012---I'm gonna finish this later, okay? Let me just grab my coat.
好的012---Okay!
怎样  你花了两分钟就能学会吗012---What, did you think you learned how to do it in the last two minutes?
或许  我们可以帮他写完012---Maybe we finish this for him.
同时  我在实验室里克隆出一只恐龙012---Also, I cloned a dinosaur in my lab.
她现在是我的女朋友了012---She is now my girlfriend.
我不在乎世俗的眼光012---I don't care what society says,
它给了我最棒的性生活012---it's the best sex I've ever had.
然后  发布012---And send.
不  你怎么能这么对他012---No, no-- You can't do that to him.
-好了  我们走  -老兄012---- All right, let's go.  - Dude!
我想你很清楚的证明了012---I think you made it clear you can't be trusted
不能让你在室内碰球012---with the ball inside the house.
然后  发布012---And send.

嘿  篮球打得怎么样012---Hey. How was basketball?
很好玩012---It was fun.

哦  天啊  是谁弄的012---Oh, no! Who did that?
钱德勒自己012---Chandler. Yeah.

她到处爬的时候看到了012---She was just crawling around and found him,
所以我就让他们一起睡觉觉012---so I just let her sleep with him.
-没关系吧  -当然  没关系012---- That's all right, isn't it?  - Of course. Yeah.
只是填充玩具而已012---It's a stuffed animal, you know?
是给小孩玩的  不是给大人的012---It's for kids. Not for adults.
这点我知道012---I know that.
乔伊  你确定吗  我知道你很爱他012---Joey, you're sure? I mean, I know how much you love him.
瑞秋  我们说清楚012---Rachel, let's be clear on this, okay?
我没有很爱他012---I do not love Huggsy.
我只是以正常的程度喜欢他012---I like him a normal amount.
好吧  但是艾玛爱死他了012---All right. Well, Emma loves him.
是啊  能不爱嘛  他那么好012---Yeah. Well, why wouldn't she? He's a wonderful person!

我已经试过所有疗伤法了012---I've tried everything to feel better.
甚至还想要写首歌012---I even tried writing a song about it...
但是我不想出任何韵律  可以配这个调的012---but I can't think of anything that rhymes with:
莫妮卡  我需要你帮我渡过这段时期012---Hey, Monica, I'm gonna need your help getting through this.
你不需要我帮忙吗012---You're saying you're not gonna need my help?
暂不  当我准备好012---No. When I get to the point where I'm ready...
要听糗死迈克笑话时012---...to hear cruel, mocking jokes about Mike,
我会来找你的012---I'm gonna come to you.
很好  因为我已经想出三个了012---Oh, good, because I've already thought of three.
四个  我刚刚又想出第四个012---Four! I just thought of a fourth!
好了  我知道我的决定是正确的012---Okay. I mean, I know I did the right thing.
迈克再也不想结婚012---Mike never wants to get married...
而我也不陷进一段没有未来的感情012---...and I shouldn't be in a relationship that has no future.
但没多久  我就会很想他012---But pretty soon, I'm gonna miss him so much...
很想再见到他012---...I'm gonna want to see him again,
到时候你一定要阻止我012---and you have to stop me.
好的  没问题012---Okay, you got it.
除非… 我是不是太小题大做了012---Unless.... Am I being too crazy about this?
好吧  就算没有未来又如何012---All right, so there's no future.
那不表示我们不会快乐啊012---But that doesn't mean we still can't have fun.
算了  就当我没说过012---You know what? Forget what I said.
真的吗012---Really?
好吧  如果你想的话012---All right, if that's what you want.
那是个测试  你没及格012---That was a test, and you just failed.
该死的  新手才会犯的错012---Damn it! Rookie mistake!
我和恐龙做爱012---I have sex with dinosaurs?
我好像有所耳闻012---I believe I read that somewhere.
不只不好笑012---Not only is it not funny,
而且从生理角度上这不可能  好吗012---it's physically impossible! Okay?
由于物种不同012---Depending on the species,
我必须要有六尺长的…012---I'd have to have a 6-foot-long--
这一点儿不好笑012---It's not funny!
对此我保留反对意见012---I respectfully disagree.
你竟然在我的校友主页上012---I can't believe you put that
写这些东西012---on my alumni page.
谁在乎呢  没人会去看的012---Who cares? Nobody reads those.
最好没有012---You better hope not...
因为我刚刚看了你主页上发布的消息012---...because I just read what you put on your page today.
我没有主页012---I don't have a page.
哦  对此我保留反对意见012---Oh, I respectfully disagree!
瞧瞧你  甜美天真的样子012---Look at you. All sweet and innocent,
睡得像天使一样012---sleeping like an angel.
被困在艾玛的肥手里012---With Emma's chubby little hands wrapped around you.
没关系  艾玛  你继续睡012---It's okay, Emma. You stay asleep.
不要靠近婴儿床  我有武器012---Step away from the crib! I have a weapon!
没关系  瑞秋  是我012---It's okay! It's okay, Rach! It's me!
快把发卷放下012---Put down the scrunchie.
你在干嘛012---What are you doing?
我听到艾玛这有声音012---Well, I heard Emma stirring...
所以我过来确定一下012---...so I came in to make sure
让她可以抓到哈格吉012---she could reach Huggsy.
谢谢  反正醒了  我要去上厕所012---Oh, thanks. All right, well, now that I'm up, I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
好的  拿去  亲爱的012---Okay, there you go, sweetie.
这事没完012---This isn't over!
等等  为什么罗斯要跟班里每个人说012---Wait a second. Why would Ross tell everyone in your class
你始终就是个同性恋012---that you are ''as gay as the day is long''?
因为我告诉大家  他跟恐龙上床012---Because I told everyone he slept with dinosaurs.
那明显就是个笑话012---Well, that's clearly a joke.
但是这有可能是真的012---This could easily be true.
你能接一下吗012---Would you get that, please?
一整天  大家不断打电话恭喜我012---People have been calling to congratulate me all day.

他总是逼我看《红磨坊》012---He just kept making me watch Moulin Rouge.

你在做什么呢012---What are you doing?
你等着看好戏吧  我的朋友012---Oh, you'll see, my friend!
我死了012---I'm dead?
英年早逝012---And so young.
发布说我死了  这一点都不好笑012---Posting that I died? That really isn't funny.
死法才比较好笑012---Well, how you died was funny.
拜托  被胖子撞死012---Oh, please. Hit by a blimp?
美国每年都有一个人因此丧命012---It kills over one Americans every year.
难以置信  我同学们会以为我死了012---Unbelievable. My classmates are gonna think I'm dead.
我的教授012---My professors.
我...我的父母会接到许多电话的012---My parents are gonna get phone calls!
你在玩弄大家的感请012---You're messing with people's feelings here.
还跟我谈大家的感情012---You wanna talk about people's feelings?
你该听听  当我告诉史登教授012---You should have heard how hurt
不能跟他一起去基韦斯特度假时012---Professor Stern was when I told him
他有多受伤012---I wouldn't be able to go to Key West!
你玩过界了  但没关系012---You've really crossed a line here. But that's okay.
因为我要去买个PS软件012---Because I'm on my way to buy some Photoshop software...
和一叠的同志色情照片012---...and a stack of gay porn.
没错  你的出柜将会是图文并茂012---That's right. Your coming-out is about to get real graphic!
天啊  我真希望迈克在这里012---God, I wish Mike were here.

你们会做什么012---what would the two of you be doing?
你们是动物吗  现在才下午四点012---What are you, animals? It's 4:00 in the afternoon.
我给他打个电话012---I gotta call him.
只是说说话  没大碍的012---Just to talk to him. There's no harm in that.
开头都是这样012---That's how it starts.
我不吃蛋糕  我只是要闻一下012---''I don't need to eat the cake, I'll just smell the icing.
就吃一点点012---Why not just a little sliver?''
或是  好吧  一两块就好012---Or, ''Okay, just a slice or two.''
然后你就210磅了012---The next thing you know, you're 210 pounds...
连过个通道都会被卡住012---...and you get wedged in going down the tunnel slide!

但是如果你跟他说话012---But look, if you talk to him,
你就会想见他了012---then you're gonna want to see him.
如果你见了他  你就会想跟他复合了012---And if you see him, you're gonna wanna get back together.
我知道  这不是你想要的012---And I know that's not what you want.
好了  把电话给我012---All right, so give me your phone.

不  不是女生  是…012---No, no, no, it's not a girl. It's...
全新的哈格吉012---...a brand-new Huggsy!
太棒了  现在艾玛有两个哈格吉了012---Oh! Oh, that's so great! Now Emma has two Huggsies!
不  艾玛有一个哈格吉012---No, no. Oh, no. No, Emma has one Huggsy.
新的哈格吉012---The new Huggsy.
另外那个哈格吉012---The other Huggsy,
我不知道  还是我把他拿回去好了012---I don't know, I guess I'll just take him back.
你知道吗  小时候012---You know what? When I was a little girl,
我有一只粉红色的小马叫棉花糖012---I had a little pink pony named Cotton.
我非常喜欢她012---Oh, I loved her so much.
去哪我都带着012---I took her everywhere.
给她的尾巴编辫子012---I would braid her tail--

旧哈格吉身上有个钮扣不见了012---Should I be concerned that a button
我找不到012---fell off the old Huggsy
不会出事吧012---and I can't find it?
不  不用担心  几年前我吞下去012---No, don't worry about it. I swallowed that years ago. Hey!
怎么了  我想她不喜欢新哈格吉012---Oh, what? I don't think she likes the new Huggsy.
但他们是一样的啊012---But he's the same.
我想她要旧的哈格吉012---I think she wants the old one back.
是哦  但他们一模一样啊012---Yeah, but he's the same.
乔伊  拿来012---Joey, come on.
根本是一样的嘛012---But he's the same!
你才不像他012---You're not the same.
你这样吓不到我012---You know, it's a lot less surprising to do that
别忘了是我放你上楼的012---after I've buzzed you into the building.
菲比  为什么门口有男人的鞋子呢012---So, Phoebe, why are there men's shoes by the door?
那是我的鞋子012---Those are my shoes.

我想要见他012---I wanted to see him.

你是怎么给他打的电话012---how did you even call him?
电话主机有免提012---There's a speakerphone on the base unit.
主机  用脑啊  莫妮卡  用用脑012---Base unit. Think, Monica, think!
听着  如果我想见菲比  而她…012---Look, if I want to see Phoebe, and she--
没你的事儿012---This doesn't concern you!
抱歉  我只是听到有人提到我的名字012---Sorry. I guess I was thrown off by the mention of my name.
听着  你们不能这样做012---Look, guys, you can't do this.
不然分手就更难了012---It's gonna make getting over each other harder.
如果我们什么都不做012---Not if nothing happens.
像朋友一样相处不行吗012---Why can't we just hang out as friends?
当然可以  如果你们只是朋友012---Sure. If you're just gonna hang out as friends,
那我也可以加入012---then maybe I'll join you.
我是你的朋友  也是迈克的朋友012---You know, I'm your friend and Mike's friend.
坐下吧012---Sit down.
给朋友让个位置012---Make room for your friend.
你过得好不好012---So how have you been?
我还挺不错的012---I've been pretty good.
你真的很美012---You look really beautiful.
谢谢  你看起来也不错012---Thanks. You look good too.
不对  这太危险了  说话注意点012---No, no, no. This is dangerous territory. Keep it clean.
钢琴弹得怎么样了012---So how's the piano playing going?
我最近弹了许多情歌012---Actually, I've been playing a lot of love songs lately.
-我好想你  -我也想你012---- I've missed you.  - I've missed you too.
来这的路上012---You know, on the way over here,
我看到一个酒鬼吐了一地012---I saw this drunk guy throw up.
然后一只鸽子还去吃012---And then a pigeon ate it.
嘿  罗斯012---Hey. Ross.
听着  我想跟你道歉012---Look, I just wanted to apologize.
别告诉我  你真的在做我的同志照012---Don't tell me you actually made those gay pictures of me.
瞧瞧这个012---Check this out.
原来如果我有健身  就是这样的啊012---So that's what I'd look like if I worked out.
而且还是警察先生为我服务012---And was being serviced by a policeman.
你不会真的发出去吧012---You're not gonna actually send these out, are you?
不会了  因为你"罗斯死了" 的笑话012---Actually, I don't need to, because your little ''Ross is dead'' joke
根本没效果012---didn't work.
好吗  根本就没有人回应012---Okay? There were no responses.
网上没人发布任何东西012---Nobody posted anything on the website,
没人打电话给我父母012---nobody called my parents,
该笑话你才对012---so the joke is on you.
没人打电话  没人写信012---Nobody called, nobody wrote anything,
没人在乎我死了012---nobody cares that I'm dead.
哦  我的天啊012---Oh, my God.
没有人在乎我死了吗012---Nobody cares that I'm dead?
哦  别这样  你知道不是那样的012---Oh, come on, you know that's not true.
说什么  你不过发布个出柜的消息012---What are you talking about? You get 60 responses...
就有六十个回复012---just for coming out of the closet.
我连一个回复都没有  我可是死了012---I didn't get one response, and I'm dead!
嗯  同志社团比死人社团话多012---Well, the gay community is a lot more vocal than the dead community.
不敢相信  连我地质学搭档都没有回复012---I can't believe this. Not even my geology lab partner.
以前都是我罩他的012---And I carried that guy!
我们重新想一下  好吧012---Look, let's think about this, okay?
大家在这悲伤的时刻012---You think people are gonna disturb your family
忍心打扰你的家人吗012---at this tragic time?
有人会在网站上张贴哀悼辞吗012---That people are gonna post condolences on a website?
不是说大家不在乎012---This isn't about people not caring.
而是没有合适的渠道悼念012---This is about people not having a decent outlet for their grief.
-说的对  的确没有合适的渠道  -没错012---- You're right. There isn't a decent outlet.  - Right.
你要是办追悼会   我肯定很多人会来的012---I'm sure if you had a funeral or memorial service, tons of people would come.
就是这样012---Exactly!
罗斯  你要干嘛012---Ross, what are you doing?
你要帮自己办追悼会012---You're having a memorial service for yourself?
不  那得多傻  是你帮我办的012---No, that would be stupid. You're having it for me.
罗斯  不要发出去  不要发…012---Ross, don't press send. Don't press--
不  太迟了  已经发了012---No, too late. Too late. It's sent.
对不起  还有你跟警察先生的照片012---Sorry, so is that picture of you and the policeman.
我刚要哄艾玛睡一下012---I'm trying to put Emma down for a nap.
你有看到哈格吉吗012---Have you seen Huggsy?
原版的还是不好的那个012---Original or crappy?
-原版的  -没有  抱歉  没有看到012---- Original.  - No. Sorry. Haven't seen him.
那你床单下面那个鼓包是什么012---Then what's that big lump under your covers?
是莫妮卡  行了吗012---It's Monica, okay?
那才不是莫妮卡012---That's not Monica!
好啦  没关系  是原版的哈格吉012---All right, fine! It's original Huggsy!
我知道艾玛要他012---I know Emma wants him,
但他是我的  而我需要他012---but he's mine and I need him.
她真不讲理012---She's being unreasonable.
乔伊  艾玛爱那个蠢企鹅是有原因的012---Joey, there is a reason that Emma loves that stupid penguin so much!
别捂他耳朵012---Oh, don't cover its ears!
因为这会让她想起乔伊叔叔012---It's because it reminds her of her Uncle Joey.
-真的  -当然012---- It does?  - Yeah.
她喜欢抱着他012---And she's comforted by him
是因为她是非常爱乔伊叔叔012---because she loves her Uncle Joey so much.
-真的  她爱我  -当然啦012---- Really? She loves me?  - Oh, yeah.
但是你知道吗012---But you know what?
如果你需要哈格吉  没关系012---If you need Huggsy, don't worry.
艾玛会谅解的  我不会  但又怎样012---Emma will totally understand. I won't, but whatever.
好的  等等  瑞秋  我是说如果…012---Okay, wait a minute, Rach. I mean, if....
如果艾玛那么喜欢哈格吉  那么…012---If Huggsy means that much to Emma, then....
嗯  就给她吧012---Well, she can have him.
亲爱的  我就知道乔伊叔叔最好了012---Oh, sweet, I knew Uncle Joey would step up.
瞧  艾玛  瞧瞧是谁回来了012---Look, Emma. Look who's back.
不  算了  我做不到012---No, forget it! Forget it! I can't do it!
你…你要把哈格吉从一个小孩手上抢走012---Are you--? You're gonna take Huggsy away from a little child?
要不然你认为012---How do you think
我当初怎么拿到哈格吉的012---I got him in the first place?
好了  你们两个  我要去上厕所012---All right, you two. I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
希望我不在的时候  不要发生什么事012---I don't want anything going on while I'm gone.
有几件事你们可以讨论012---Here's a few things you can discuss:
黏液  真菌  还可以想象我跟罗斯乱搞012---Mucus, fungus, and the idea of me and Ross doing it.
我真的好想你012---I've missed you so much.
我不会要求你复合012---I won't ask you to get back together.
我知道我们要的是不同的东西 但…012---I know we want different things, but....
我只想和你再多待一个晚上012---Just to be with you one more night.
我也想要012---I want that too.
但是那不是会让我们更痛苦吗012---But is that gonna make it too hard?
还能比现在更痛苦吗012---It can't be any harder than this.
如果我知道012---I mean, if  had known the last time I saw you
上次是见你的最后一面  我…012---would be the last time, I--
我会努力记住你的脸012---I would have stopped to memorize your face,
你的一举一动012---the way you moved.
你的所有012---Everything about you.
如果我知道  上次是最后一次吻你…012---If I had known the last time I kissed you would be the last time...
那我永远都不会停下来012---I never would have stopped.
亲他  你个傻瓜012---Kiss him, you fool!
-什么  -你没有听到他说什么吗012---- What?  - Didn't you hear that speech?
如果你再不亲他  我就上了012---If you don't kiss him, then I will.
我好想你012---I missed you so much.
-我就知道你在这里  -妈的012---- I knew you'd be here!  -Crap.
-他是谁  -我朋友曼尼012---- Who is this?  - My friend Manny.
我请他看着我  远离你012---I asked him to keep me away from you.
我也在帮菲比做同样的事012---Hey, that's what I'm doing for Phoebe.
看来你做得还真差012---Well, you're not doing a very good job.
-你说什么  -这个吻怎么回事012---- Excuse me?  - What's with the kissing?
至少我知道我管的人在哪儿012---Hey, at least I knew where my guy was.
是啊  感谢上帝012---Yeah, thank God
有你在这里监看他们亲吻012---you were here to oversee all the kissing.
你没有听到他说的话012---You didn't hear the speech.
我听到了012---I've heard the speech.
如果他知道那是最后一次…012---If he knew it was gonna be the last time--
那很感人的  是你太无情了012---Hey, it was very moving. You're just heartless!
-你太软弱了  -你太奇怪了012---- You're weak!  -You're weird!
你裤子拉链没拉012---Your pants are undone.
他们呢012---Where'd they go?
-该死的  -我们搞砸了012---- Damn it.  - Well, we blew it.
我只能怪我自己012---I blame myself.
而我也只能怪你012---And I blame you too.
已经一个小时了012---It's been an hour,
我同学竟然一个都没来012---and not one of my classmates has shown up?
我告诉你  要是我真的死了012---I tell you, when I actually die,
有些人一定会被鬼缠死的012---some people are gonna get seriously haunted.
来了  有人来了012---There you go. Someone came.
好了  好了  我躲起来了012---Okay. Okay. I'm gonna go hide.
太兴奋了  我第一个追悼者012---This is so exciting. My first mourner!
嗨  很高兴你能够来012---Hi. Glad you could come.
请进012---Please come in.
你是钱德勒·宾吧012---Hi. You're Chandler Bing, right?
我是汤姆·高登  是你班上的同学012---I'm Tom Gordon. I was in your class.
哦  是的  是的  我来帮你拿外套012---Oh, yes. Yes, let me take your coat.
谢谢  罗斯的事我很遗憾  真是…012---Thanks. I'm so sorry about Ross, it's....
没关系  至少他去世时正在做喜欢的事012---No, at least he died doing what he loved.
看大胖子012---Watching blimps.
那是谁012---Who is it?
你认识一个叫汤姆·高登的吗012---You know some guy, Tom Gordon?
我不记得他了012---I don't remember him.
但是  我启发过太多人了012---But then again, I touched so many lives.
那你跟罗斯很熟吗012---So did you know Ross well?
不算认识012---Actually, I barely knew him.
我来是因为听到钱德勒的事012---I came because I heard Chandler's news.
他有对象了吗012---Do you know if he's seeing anyone?
是的  他有  就是我012---Yes, he is. Me.
什么  你是说…012---What? You mean--?
我可以问你一个私人问题吗012---Can I ask you a personal question?
你是怎么把胡子刮得这么干净的012---How do you shave your beard so close?
好了  小汤姆  你哀悼得够了012---Okay, Tommy! That's enough mourning for you.
走吧  再见  好了012---Here we go. Bye-bye. All right.
-听着  打电话给我  -好的012---- Hey, listen. Call me.  - Okay.
没人关心我的死活吗012---I'm dead and no one cares?
我看起来像男人吗012---I look like a man?
拜托  荒谬的问题  一次一个就好012---Please, one ridiculous problem at a time.
这并不荒谬  你看嘛  根本没有人来012---This isn't ridiculous. Look around, no one's here.
你只给他们一天的时间012---You gave them one day's notice.
又不是每个人天天都上网012---Not everyone checks the website every day.
而有莫妮卡  或许因为你的站像012---And Monica, it's probably the way you stand!
你说的可能对012---I guess you're right.
但是  总该要有人看到啊012---Still, somebody must have seen it.
我在学校上了四年012---I went to that school for four years
竟然没有影响到任何人012---and I didn't have an impact on anyone?
嗯  不是那样的  你有影响到我啊012---Well, that's not true. You had an impact on me.
已经十五年了012---I mean, it's 15 years later
我们依旧是最要好的朋友012---and we're still best friends.
对你来说  这不算什么吗012---Doesn't that count for something?
太好了  更多狂野男孩来找钱德勒了012---Oh, great, more party boys for Chandler.
我敢说一定是来看你的  去躲起来012---I'm sure it's somebody for you. Now go hide.
嗨  我来参加罗斯·盖勒的追悼会012---Hi. I'm here for Ross Geller's memorial service.
-可芮  可芮·薇丝顿  -是的012---- Kori? Kori Weston?  - Yeah.
-你可真漂亮  -你是谁呢012---- You look amazing.  - And you are?
钱德勒  钱德勒·宾012---Chandler. Chandler Bing.
而且我不是同志  我一点都不是012---And I'm not gay. I'm not gay at all.
但你是已婚的012---You are married, though.
别听这哥们的  他只是心情很差012---Don't listen to him. He's in a really bad mood.
我不敢相信罗斯去世了  太难过了012---I can't believe that Ross is gone. It is just so sad.
我不知道罗斯跟你很熟012---I didn't know Ross and you were so close.
并没有  但我们一起上过课  他012---Oh, we weren't. But we had one class together.
是个很棒的人012---He was such a great guy.
每次谈到科学都激情四射012---And he talked so passionately about science.
我一直记得他012---I always remembered him.
我肯定这话对他很重要012---I'm sure that would mean a lot to him.
而且如果天堂有一扇门012---And if heaven has a door...
我敢说  他一定耳朵贴着门专心在听012---...I'm sure he's pressing his ear up against it and listening intently.
我好多次都想打电话约他出去012---I thought so many times about calling him and asking him out.
大概我再也没有机会了012---I guess I really missed my chance.
不  你还有机会012---No, you didn't!
我还活着012---I'm still alive!
可芮  我知道你很惊讶012---Kori, I know this is a big surprise for you.
说来话长012---It's a long story.
但是你刚说的话012---But the things you just said
让我这一天变得很美好012---really made my day.
你能来  对我意义重大012---The fact that you're here means more to me...
比房间都挤满了人还要好012---...than if this room were filled with people.
你这变态  谁会做这种事012---You sick freak! Who does that?
不敢相信我还喜欢过你012---I can't believe I had a crush on you.
你们有听到吗012---Did you hear that?
可芮·薇丝顿喜欢过我012---Kori Weston had a crush on me!
没啦  妈  我没死012---No, Mom, I am not dead.
我知道这种事情不能开玩笑012---I know it's not something to kid about.
只是我跟钱德勒之间的恶作剧012---It was just a practical joke between Chandler and me,
已经结束了  好吗012---but it's over, okay?
不会的  即使我死了012---Actually, no. Even if I had died,
你也不会后继无人的012---you would not be left childless.
莫妮卡012---Monica?
莫妮卡  你的保时捷能借我吗012---Monica? Hey, can I borrow the Porsche?
-好的  -太好了012---- Okay.  - All right!
有什么"不准"的呢012---But what is it not?
不准在车上和我女性朋友玩乐012---A place to entertain my lady friends.
还有什么呢012---And what else is it not?
不准在车上吃意大利面012---A place to eat spaghetti.
乖  你开车干嘛去012---Very good. What do you need it for anyway?
强力球彩票的奖金已经累积到三亿了012---The Powerball lottery is up to 300 million...
但是这里又没有卖的012---and they don't sell tickets here.
所以你要开车到康涅狄格州去买012---So you're driving up to Connecticut?
对  康涅狄格州  不是西弗吉尼亚州012---Yeah, Connecticut. Not West Virginia.
也许我可以开车载你去012---Maybe I'll drive you up there.
我也想买几张彩票012---I'd like to buy some tickets myself.
钱德勒不挣钱  这三亿我们可以用一下012---Yeah, with Chandler not getting paid, we could really use $300 million.
是的  如果我还是原来的工作012---Yes, because if I was at my old job,
我们会说"三亿元  不用  谢了"012---we'd say, ''300 million? No, thank you.''
你可以帮我买吗012---Will you get me tickets too?
对啊  我也要012---Yeah, me too.
-当然  -我有个主意012---- Sure.  - I have an idea.
我们一人拿五十块钱  一起买012---Why don't we all pitch in 50 bucks, we'll pool our money together...
如果我们中奖  大家平分012---and then if we win, we'll split it.
这主意不错012---That's a great idea!
不用  谢了012---No, thanks.
你不想要中彩票吗012---You don't wanna win the lottery?
我当然想012---Sure I do.
我还想当国王呢012---I also want to be king of my own country...
我还想知道阿梅莉亚·埃尔哈特怎么了012---...and find out what happened to Amelia Earhart.
还在想那个女飞行员吗012---Still on Amelia Earhart?
那女人就那样消失了012---The woman just vanished!
说真的  你真的不加入吗012---Seriously, you don't want in on this?
不要  你们知道012---No. Do you know what
中彩票的机率有多大吗012---your odds are of winning the lottery?
比你被雷劈四十二次的机率还小012---I mean, you have a better chance of being struck by lightning 42 times.
但是我们有六个人012---But there's six of us,
所以我们只需要被打到七次012---so we'd only have to get struck 7 times.
我喜欢这种机率012---I like those odds!
真的  你们  我不敢相信012---Seriously, you guys, I can't believe
你们居然花了两百五十块买彩票012---you're gonna spend $250 on the lottery.
这实在太狗便便了吧012---I mean, that's such a bunch of boo-hockey.
我来问012---I'll ask.
狗便便012---''Boo-hockey''?
艾玛已经要开始学说话了012---Oh, we think Emma's about to start talking...
所以我们在她面前会注意用词012---...so we're trying to be careful about what words we use in front of her.
准备好吧  你们会听到很多的狗便便012---So get ready to hear a lot of boo-hockey...
"去安息吧"还有"她母亲的"等等012---...gosh darn it and brother pucker.
你怎么知道她要开始说话了012---How do you know she's gonna start talking?
我跟她说话的时候012---When I talk to her,
我似乎感觉到  她好像能听懂012---I almost feel like she understands what I'm saying.
有点像乔伊012---Kind of like Joey.
你说什么012---What's that now?
《老友记》  第九季 第18集  彩票啊彩票012---Friends S09E18 The One With The Lottery
天啊  瞧瞧这些彩票  激动人心啊012---God, look at all these tickets. It's so exciting.
自从六年级后012---I haven't won anything
我就没有赢过任何东西了012---since sixth grade.
吃派大赛吗012---Pie-eating contest?
因为我原来很胖012---You assume because I was heavy
你就以为那是我唯一能赢的比赛吗012---that's the only way I could win something?
不  我看过你全身都是蓝莓的照片012---No, I saw a picture of you covered in blueberries.
-那天还真开心啊  -是啊012---- That was a good day.  - Yeah.
他们要把你的车拖走了012---They're towing your car!
我车停在莫顿的车库里012---I'm parked in a garage on Morton.
他们要把一辆车拖走了012---They're towing a car.
而我眼冒金星了012---And I am seeing spots.
罗斯  你没带艾玛012---Ross, you don't have Emma!
瑞秋  你也没有在带艾玛012---Rachel, you don't have Emma!
艾玛呢  艾玛到哪去了012---Where's Emma? Who has Emma?
乔伊  别紧张012---Joey, relax.
两小时前  我妈把她接走了  你也在啊012---My mother picked her up two hours ago. You were there.
有吗012---I was?
是的  你还跟她说话012---Yes, and you talked to her.
-我有吗  -她还带来了砂锅菜来012---- I did?  - She dropped off a casserole.
对  那个砂锅夫人012---Oh, yeah, the casserole lady.
你是过来看我们中大奖的吗012---Did you come by to watch us win the big bucks?
是啊  我还想在你们中奖后012---Yeah. And then I figured after you win,
全部到阳台上012---we can all go out to the balcony...
看小精灵在夜之彩虹上跳舞012---and see a night rainbow with gremlins dancing on top of it.
别碰电话  我来接012---Don't touch the phone! I'll get it!
-你觉得他有洗手吗  -你好012---- You think he washed his hands?  - Hello?
查理  有什么消息012---Hey, Charlie, what do you know?

他们公司开始决定雇佣谁了012---Chandler's supposed to find out
钱德勒在等消息012---if he's getting a job at his agency.
但在十五名实习生中012---But out of 15 interns,
他们只聘请三个人012---they're only hiring three.
-机率真小  -是啊012---- Tough odds.  - Yeah.
像你们二十四州联合彩票的012---If only it were a sure thing
机率一样高012---like your 24-state lottery.
是啊  瞧瞧谁想通了012---Yeah, look who's coming around!
该死  好啦  有消息再通知我012---Damn it. All right, call me when you know more.
-用你了吗  -一个名额已经被占了012---- Did you get it?  - One of the slots got filled.
-被你吗  -听话听音012---- By you?  - Sense the tone.
不是我  是个叫内特的小子012---No, that kid Nate got it.
喔  我讨厌那小子012---Oh, I hate that guy.
真想说  有没有搞错012---I mean, come on,
小子  把裤子提上去012---kid, pull up your pants!
还有两个名额不是吗012---Well, there's two spots left, right?
是  我真的好想要  我想要被录取012---Yeah. I mean, I want this so much. I wanna get one.
也希望我朋友查理被录取012---I want my friend Charlie to get one.
其实我不是很在乎查理012---Except I don't care about Charlie.
-嘿  你们好  -嘿012---- Hey, you guys.  - Hey!
你们不会相信的012---You are not gonna believe this.
我刚刚遇到我的算命师傅012---I just saw my psychic.
她说我今晚一定会中彩票的012---and she said I was definitely gonna win the lottery tonight!
提醒我了  我想要增加好运012---That's reminds me.I thought we could use some extra luck...
所以从餐厅带了个幸运骨头回来012---...so I brought a wishbone home from work.
算命师傅再加上幸运骨头012---A psychic and a wishbone?
拜托给别人留点机会吧012---Guys, give someone else a chance.
好了  谁来012---All right, who wants to do it?
我可以吗012---Can I?
素食者从来就没机会玩幸运骨头012---Vegetarians never get to do the wishbone.
特别不公平  我们只是不吃肉012---It's really not fair. Just because we don't eat the meat...
不代表我们不喜欢玩尸骨012---...doesn't mean we don't like to play with the carcasses.
好了  瑞秋呢012---All right. Rach?
我不想要让手沾上火鸡的味道012---I don't want that turkey smell all over my hands.
我来  我要把砂锅菜的味道盖过去012---I'll do it! It'll get the casserole stink off of mine.
-希望我会赢  -嗯  没有关系012---- I hope I win.  - Well, it doesn't really matter.
你们的愿望是一样的012---You're both wishing for the same thing.
我不能告诉你我许什么愿012---I can't tell you what I'm wishing for,
要不然不会实现的012---or else, you know, it won't come true.
对  但是我们都知道你许什么愿012---Right. But we know what you're wishing for.
-我真不能讲出来  -我了解012---- I can't really say.  - I understand.
但你许的愿跟我们想的一样  不是吗012---But you're wishing for what we think, aren't you?
我真的很不喜欢这些问题012---I'm not really comfortable with these questions!
-拜托  -赶快做012---- Please!  - Just do it!
好的  一  二  三012---Okay. One, two, three.
我赢了  嘿012---I won! Hey!
你们知道吗012---You know what?
我确定你们的愿望会成真012---I'm sure your wish is gonna come true.
但是  为了以防万一012---But, you guys, just in case,
我们来擦这个灯  或许灯神会出现012---maybe a genie will come out if we rub this lamp.
那东西好烫啊012---That thing gets hot!
罗斯  你可以继续取笑我们012---Ross, just keep making your jokes.
万一我们真中奖了  你怎么想012---How are you gonna feel if we actually do win?
你们不会中的012---You're not gonna win.
我知道机率很小012---I know the odds are against us...
但是总是有人会中012---...but somebody has to win,
也有可能是我们  到时候你怎么想012---and it could be us. And then how you gonna feel?
我们会说"大家开直升机去海岬玩吧"012---We're gonna be like, ''Everybody, let's take our helicopters up to the Cape.''
而你只能说  我不行…012---And you're gonna be all, like, ''Oh, I can't, guys.
待会见好了  我得给我的现代加油012---I'll have to meet you up there. I gotta gas up the Hyundai.''
够了  我听过自己的录音012---Okay, I've heard myself on tape,
根本不是这样的012---and I sound nothing like that.
到时候头条新闻是这样的012---I can see the headline now:
"因见好友们中彩票012---''Lottery Winners' Friend,
懊悔不已   自食手臂"012---Filled With Regret, Eats Own Arm.''
我为什么要吃自己的手臂012---Why would I eat my own arm?
你当然不会012---Well, you wouldn't,
但我们可以买下那报社  爱怎么写就怎么写012---but we own the paper. We can print whatever we want.
你知道吗  我帮你出五十块好了012---You know what? I'm gonna throw in 50 bucks for you.
-为什么  -因为我知道你认为012---- Why?  - Because I know that you think...
彩票是很狗便便的东西012---that the lottery is boo-hockey...
但大家在一起等着开奖  会很好玩的012---...but we're all here, and we're gonna watch the numbers and have fun.
你是我哥  我希望你也有份012---And you're my brother, and I want you to be a part of this.
你不用这样  我自己付钱好了012---You don't have to do that. I mean, I'll pay for myself.
你想让我和你们一起开心012---But just the fact that you want me to have fun with you guys,
真的是太窝心了012---that's so sweet.
过来012---Come here.
开房去吧012---Get a room.
你已经加入了012---So now that you're in,
要是中奖了  你会干嘛012---what are you gonna do if we win?
我不知道  或许投资吧012---I don't know. I'll probably just invest it.
你能再冷静点吗012---Calm down.
正经点  这就是你的白日梦012---Seriously, that's your fantasy?
就是投资012---To invest it?
我很抱歉  我是说投资吗012---Oh, I'm sorry. Did I say, ''invest it''?
我的意思是"快乐的全部花光光"012---I meant, ''Be cool and piss it all away.''
我知道了  我们该把全部的钱凑起来012---I know! We should pool all our money
买下尼克斯队012---and buy the Knicks!
我不是很在乎尼克斯队012---I don't really care about the Knicks.
如果我选你当前锋  你就会了012---You will when I pick you as starting forward.
你会那样做吗  我从没有被选上012---You would do that? I never get picked!
我不确定球队会是正确的选择012---I'm not sure a sports team is the way to go.
你不让我买尼克斯队吗012---You won't let me buy the Knicks?
不敢相信你要打破我的梦想012---I can't believe you're taking this away.
你说的对  这个梦想已经有十五秒之久了012---You're right, it has been your dream for over 15 seconds.
还要多久才会摇奖  妈咪012---How long until they announce the numbers, Mommy?
这个也让我来  "妈咪"012---I'll take this one too. ''Mommy''?
喔  我要习惯叫瑞秋"妈咪"012---Oh, I've gotten into the habit of calling Rachel...
只要是艾玛在场012---...''Mommy'' when we're around Emma.
我现在发现她并不在012---Which I now realize we are not.
希望她听久了  她第一句话会说这个012---I'm hoping that if she hears it enough, it'll be her first word.
如果真的要这样做012---Although if we're gonna do that,
你也应该叫我"爹地"才对012---we should probably call me ''Daddy'' too.
我喜欢哦  爹地012---I like that, Daddy.
我只是在说瑞秋012---I was just talking about Rachel.
爹地生气了吗012---Is Daddy getting angry?
爹地要打我吗012---Is Daddy gonna spank me?
嗯  那要看012---Well, that depends.
你是不是不乖...012---Have you been a bad--?
不行  我演不下去012---No, I can't.
哈啰  嘿  查理  还有其他人吗012---Hello? Hello? Hey, Charlie. Did anybody else hear?
什么  苏珊拿到了  怎么会呢012---What? Susan got it? How?
喔  天啊  早知道我也跟他上床012---Oh, man, I would've slept with him!
好了  拜012---All right, bye.
老兄  我很抱歉012---Dude, I'm sorry. But hey,
还有一个名额  不是吗012---there's one spot left, right?
那也是查理的012---Well, Charlie's gonna get that.
别那样说012---Hey, don't say that.
你也有一样的机会012---You've got just as good a chance of getting that job.
他是老板的儿子012---He is the boss' son.
-来吧  彩票  -是啊012---- Come on, lottery!  - Yeah!
大概二十分钟就开奖了012---It starts in, like, 20 minutes.
好了  我们来吧012---Okay, here we go.
我们需要尽快分配这些彩票对奖012---We need to sort through the tickets quickly to see if we've won.
谁有主意要怎么安排吗012---So does anybody have any ideas how to organize this?
好的  这样如何012---Okay, how about this:
我们分成六组各四十张012---We divide them into six groups of 40.
剩下的十张就由先对完的人来对012---The remaining 10 can be read by whoever finishes first.
我还有一个主意012---I have another idea.
很抱歉  提议时间已经过了012---I'm sorry, idea time is over.
-所有的彩票都在碗里了吗  -是的012---- Well, are all the tickets in the bowl?  - Yeah.
那床头柜上面的那些呢012---What about the ones on the nightstand?
那边没有彩票012---There are no tickets there.
那边有  我几分钟前才看到012---Yes, there are. I just saw them a few minutes ago.
不对  没有  你看错了012---No, you didn't. You must be mistaken.
床头柜上有二十张彩票012---There are 20 tickets on the nightstand.
钱德勒  听话听音012---Chandler, sense the tone.
哎呦喂  瞧瞧妈咪找到了什么012---Well, well, well. Look what Mommy found.
好啦  我给自己和钱德勒多买了二十张012---Okay, fine. I bought 20 extra tickets for me and Chandler.
算命的还说我会被朋友背叛012---The psychic also said that I would be betrayed.
我不敢相信  我以为我们是一起的012---I can't believe this. I thought we were all in this together.
你五分钟前才加入的012---Hey, you just got in five minutes ago!
是三分钟前012---Three minutes ago!
我不知道那有什么重要的012---I don't know why that's important.
我们一直在一起012---I was with you the whole time.
你是什么时候买的012---When did you even get those?
就在你看未拆封的色情书刊的时候012---When you were reading the dirty magazines without taking off the plastic.
我教你012---I'll show you how.
好了  莫妮卡012---Okay. Well, Monica,
假设你的额外彩票中奖了怎么办012---suppose one of your special tickets wins?
你中了彩票但失去了朋友  你怎么办012---How are you gonna feel when you win and lose your friends?
拜托  如果我中奖了012---Please. If I win the lottery,
你们才不会离开我012---you guys are not gonna leave me.
上星期有人给我些小松饼012---Someone gave me muffins last week,
就让你们骚扰了我整整三天012---and I couldn't get rid of you for three days!
钱德勒  你可以告诉她这是不对的吗012---Chandler, would you just tell her what she did was wrong?
她说得对012---She's right.
你不应该帮我们两个另买彩票012---You shouldn't have bought tickets just for us.
让我说完012---Let me finish.
然而  看起来我好像得不到这份工作了012---However, it doesn't look like I'm gonna get this job...
原则太贵  承受不起012---...so I can't afford to have principles.
所以  去你们的  彩票是我们的012---So screw you! The tickets are ours!
我嫁了个好男人012---There's the man I married.
好了  相信我  如果你们中奖了012---All right. Believe me, if you win the lottery
我们不再是朋友012---it's the last you're gonna hear from us.
无所谓  不用你们当朋友012---Fine. Don't be my friends.
我会买新朋友012---I'll buy new friends.
是的  我还会付钱让他们做整形手术012---Yeah, and then I'll pay for their plastic surgery
变得跟你们一模一样012---so they look just like you!
你知道吗  我要拿回我的份012---You know what? I want my share of the tickets.
我也要拿回我的012---I want my tickets too!
而且我要买下尼克斯队012---And I'm buying the Knicks!
还有施特菲·格拉芙（德国网球运动员）012---And Steffi Graf!
太好了  那我也要拿回我的012---Cool. Then I want mine too!
如果我中奖…012---And if I win...
我要拿全部的钱去买低利公债012---I'm gonna put it all into a very low-yield bond!
不行  我们必须要把彩票放在一起012---No. You guys, we gotta keep all the tickets together.
不  我们应该分一分012---No. No, we should divide them up...
而且我应该多分点012---...and I should get extra
因为是开我的车买的012---because we used my car!
如果有人可以多拿一些012---Hey! Hey! If anybody gets extra tickets,
那也应该是我012---it should be me!
这整件事都是我想出来的012---This whole thing was my idea!
是啊  谢谢你发明彩票012---Yeah. Thanks for inventing the lottery!
把彩票给我  我来分012---Just give them to me, and I'll split them up!
嘿  嘿012---Hey, hey!
天啊  我再也受不了了012---God, I can't take it anymore!
我来结束这一切012---I'm putting an end to this!
如果她跳楼了  她的彩票就是我的012---Okay, if she jumps, I get her tickets!
等等  不  嘿012---Wait, no, no! Hey!
要么同进退  要么一切归零012---If we're not doing this together, we're not doing it at all.
跟你们的彩票说再见吧012---Say goodbye to your tickets.
不  不  不012---No! No! No!
不要再靠近过来了012---Do not come any closer!
我可以再靠近一点点吗012---Can I come a little bit closer?
我的宝贝被压到了012---Valuable things are getting squished.
现在  什么比较重要012---Now, what's more important,
朋友还是钱012---your friends or money?
-朋友  -钱012---- Friends!  - Money!
朋友012---Friends.
嘿  莫妮卡  那你额外的彩票呢012---Hey, Monica, what about your extra tickets?
全都在里面了012---They're all in there.
还有我内衣藏的这五张012---Even these five that I hid in my bra.
莫妮卡012---Monica!
好的  很好  你们都吓坏了012---Okay. Good. You guys were so scared.
我才不会丢掉这些...012---There is no way I was gonna dump this--
天啊  不012---God! No!
我好像把你的碗摔破了012---I think I broke your bowl.
快快快012---Go! Go! Go!
多美好的夜晚啊  到街上去找彩票012---What a beautiful night to be running around the street, looking for tickets.
而且被风一吹就更有趣了012---And the wind sure made it fun.
菲比  有一半不见了012---Phoebe, we lost half of them.
那又怎样012---So what?
莫妮卡  我们还是会中奖的012---Monica, we have the winning ticket.
算命师傅说我会中奖的  记得吗012---My psychic said I was gonna win, remember?
奇怪的是012---Weird your psychic didn't mention
算命师没算到可怕的鸽子012---anything about the scary pigeon.
她有说过  我就是那么死的012---As a matter of fact, she said that's how I'm going to die.
所以  原谅我有点被吓到012---So excuse me for being a little skittish.
有两通留言  可能是工作的消息012---There's two messages. This could be from work.
-放出来  -好了  来了012---- Oh, play them.  - Okay. Here we go.
你好  我是阳台上的鸽子012---Hello. This is the pigeon from the balcony
打电话过来道歉的012---calling to apologize.
我不应该把彩票012---I shouldn't have knocked the tickets
从那个漂亮小姐手中弄翻012---out of the pretty lady's hand.
全是我的错  不关她的事  拜012---It was all my fault. Not hers. Bye.
嗯  他这道歉能做到一定很难012---Well, I bet that was very hard for him to do.
嘿  钱德勒  我是查理012---Hey, Chandler, it's Charlie.
就是这个了012---This is it.
听着  结果最后的名额给我了012---Listen, it turns out I got the last spot.
我很抱歉  老兄  很高兴跟你共事过012---I'm really sorry, man. It was a lot of fun working with you.
再打电话给我吧012---Give me a call if you want.
天啊  我很难过  亲爱的012---Gosh, I'm so sorry, honey.
真替你难过  钱德勒012---Sorry, Chandler.
这真是不公平  这就像那次012---It is so unfair. It's like that time
他们升珊卓  而不是我一样012---they promoted Saundra over me at work.
她跟拉夫·劳伦是亲戚吗012---Was she related to Ralph Lauren?
不是  只是她工作能力比我强太多了012---No, she was just much better at her job than me.
你们大家  快要开奖了012---You guys, the drawing's about to start.
我们应该打电话给我妈012---We should call my mom's
跟艾玛说晚安012---and say good night to Emma...
-趁她还没睡着  -好主意012---- before she goes down.  - Good idea.
亲爱的  这件事上你真的很坚强012---Honey, you're being really strong about this.
我知道你很想要这份工作012---I know how badly you wanted that job.
是啊  我觉得本来是我应得的012---Yeah, you know, I really thought I deserved it.
让我们来赢彩票吧012---But let's go win the lottery.
我们还有一百三十个机会  不是吗012---I mean, we still have a 130 chances to win, right?
一百三十一个012---Hundred and thirty-one.
是的  晚安甜心  我爱你012---Yeah, good night, sweetheart. I love you.
还有记住  你是爹地的小乖女012---And remember, you're Daddy's little girl.
菲比完全毁了这感觉012---Phoebe's totally ruined that for me.
嗨  妈  让艾玛听012---Hi, Mom. Put her back on.
瑞秋  他们在开奖了012---Rach, they're announcing the numbers!
我的天啊  我可以感到自己在改变了012---My God, I can already feel myself changing.
强力球彩票中奖号码  有五十三012---Here are your official Powerball numbers. We have 53.
-我有  -我们也有一个012---- I've got that.  - We have one too!
我们快中奖了012---We are on the road, people!
快点012---Come on!
妈  拜托012---Mom, please,
我知道你喜欢你的新嘴唇012---I know you love your new lips,
但是我听不太懂你说什么012---but I can barely understand you.
可以让我跟我女儿道晚安吗012---Would you please just let me say good night to my daughter?
然后接下来的号码是七012---And here we go. The Powerball is seven.
好了  你们快对号码  让我发财吧012---All right, check your numbers! Make me rich.
你们大家  你们不会相信这个的012---You guys, you're not gonna believe this.
我刚刚在跟艾玛说晚安的时候012---I was just saying good night to Emma,
她说了第一个单词012---and she said her first words.
-什么  -她说了什么012---- What?  - Well, what did she say?
她说了"葛利巴"012---She said, ''Gleba'' !
让我发财吧012---Make me rich!
是不是很惊人呢012---Isn't that amazing?
是啊  真是太棒了012---Oh, yeah. No, no, no, that's great.
你怎么会不兴奋呢012---Why aren't you more excited?
瑞秋  "葛利巴"不算单词012---Rach, gleba is not a word.
它当然算012---Well, of course it is.
好吧  那它是什么意思呢012---Okay. What does it mean?
我又不认识所有的字词012---Well, I don't know all the words.
我很高兴没有错过我女儿开口讲话012---You know, I'm just glad I didn't miss my daughter's first word.
你就是错过了  "葛利巴"算012---Yes you did! Gleba is a word!
好的  那用它造句012---Okay. Use it in a sentence.
好的  艾玛刚刚说了"葛利巴"012---Okay. Emma just said, ''Gleba.''
那不算说话012---It's not a word.
好的  我来查字典012---Okay, fine. I'm gonna look it up.
好的  太好了012---Okay, great.
顺便查一下  有天她说的另外一句012---While you're at it, she said another word the other day.
你何不也查查看这个012---Why don't you look up:
好了  葛利巴...012---All right. Okay. Okay. Gleba...
找到了  "含孢子的丰厚菌种"012---Here it is! ''The fleshy, spore-bearing inner mass of a certain fungi.''
她会成为科学家的012---She's gonna be a scientist.
-该死的  有人有对到吗  -没有012---- Damn it. Anybody got anything?  - No.
我还在对我的012---I'm still looking through mine.
再对一次  没有012---Just double-checking. No.
没有  没有012---No. No.
没有012---No!
你好  等一下012---Hello? Hold on.
是你老板012---It's your boss.
"拒绝你了  很抱歉"的电话来了012---The ''I'm sorry I rejected you'' phone call.
我还真不习惯男生打这种电话来012---I'm not used to getting these from guys.
-嘿  史提夫  -钱德勒  嗨012---- Hey, Steve.  - Chandler, hi.
我想你已经听说  我们三个名额都满了012---I'm sure you've heard we filled the three positions.
我们觉得以你的成熟度及经验012---We felt that with your maturity and experience...
你不会甘心当个助理而已的012---you wouldn't be happy being someone's assistant.
我爱死当助理了  接听电话…012---I'd love to be somebody's assistant. Answering phones...
倒咖啡  我就是为那些工作而活的012---...getting coffee, I live for that stuff.
而且我并没有很成熟012---And I'm not too mature.
放屁  咪咪  屁蛋012---Farts, boobies, butt cracks!
钱德勒  你是全部的人里面最优秀的012---Chandler, you were the strongest person in the program.
我们要聘请你当初级广告文案012---We're offering you the position of junior copywriter.
我  那个刚刚才说"屁蛋"的人012---Me? That guy who just said, ''butt cracks''?
是的  没错012---Yes, that's right.
我们很期望你能带给这份工作…012---We're excited about the level of sophistication...
一定程度的深度012---...you'll be bringing to the job.
好的  谢谢  你不会失望的  明天见012---Okay. Well, thanks, you won't regret it. I'll see you tomorrow.
怎么了012---What?
对  我要当初级广告文案了012---Oh, yeah, I'm gonna be a junior copywriter.
恭喜了  亲爱的  为你骄傲012---Congratulations! Oh, sweetie, I'm so proud of you.
谢谢  这表示我今晚可以被爱爱吗012---Thanks. Does that mean I get the good loving tonight?
当然  不看电视或什么其它的012---You bet. No TV or anything.
嘿  恭喜你找到工作了012---Hey, that is so great about the job.
谢了  老兄012---Thanks, man.
我其实也有帮到忙012---I'd like to think I had something to do with it.
真的吗  怎么说012---Really? Why?

我曾经梦过跟麦当劳的卡通市长结婚（Mayor McCheese:以前一个麦当劳的卡通人物  头是一个汉堡）012---l used to dream that l got married to Mayor McCheese.
然后在我们新婚之夜  我吃了他的头012---And on our wedding night, l ate his head.
好的012---Okay.
这一点也…012---Well, this is like that...
不像是那样012---...in no way.
我昨晚梦到我想要亲乔伊012---l had a dream last night that l wanted to kiss Joey.
哇  你是说真的亲吻他吗012---Wow! You mean like ''kiss him'' kiss him?
是啊  我是说那种很激情的012---Oh, yeah. l mean, it was pretty intense.
-为什么会那样呢  -我不知道012---- What brought that on? - l don't know.
或许跟我看到他演出那场爱情戏有关012---Maybe it had to do with the fact l saw him do a love scene.
-爱情戏  跟谁呢  -奥莉维亚012---- A love scene? With who? - Olivia.
奥莉维亚012---Olivia?!
我以为她要跟康纳结婚了012---l thought she was marrying Connor?!
对了  现实生活比较重要012---Oh, right. Real life more important.
你认为我的梦代表什么吗012---You think my dream means anything?
我不知道012---l don't know.
你看到他演出爱情戏012---l mean, you saw him do a love scene.
或许对乔伊没有感觉012---So maybe you don't have a thing for Joey.
或许你是对德雷克有感觉012---Maybe you have a thing for Drake.
是啊  在梦里是当乔伊012---Well, it was Joey reading
在念德雷克台词的时候012---Drake's lines in the dream.
当然啰  相信我012---Of course it was. Trust me,
只要是跟心理学有关012---when it comes to psychology...
我是很内行的012---...l know what l'm talking about.
我在大学的时候修过两堂心理学012---l took two psych classes in college.
你一堂课修了两次012---You took the same class twice.
那很难耶012---lt was hard!
我知道012---l know.
嘿012---Hey.
嗨  菲比012---Hi, Phoebe.
莫妮卡012---Here, Monica,
瞧瞧我为了要到你餐厅演唱012---look what l got to wear
买了什么012---when l play at your restaurant.
等等012---Wait.
我想这会提高012---Right? l think this might even class up
《没有割包皮男人之民谣》的格调012---''The Ballad of the Uncircumcised Man.''
菲比…012---Phoebe...
或许我之前说的不够清楚012---...maybe l wasn't clear before.
我真的很喜欢在这里听你的音乐012---l really love listening to your music here.
但是我的餐厅是比较高级的地方012---But my restaurant, it's sort of an upscale place.
好的  好吧012---Right, yeah, okay.
我会要管家帮我把012---l'll ask the butler to fetch
我的钻石从保险箱拿出来012---my diamonds out of the vault.
菲比  不是你穿的衣服的关系012---Phoebe, it's not what you wear.
是你的歌012---lt's sort of your songs.
我只是觉得你不应该再到餐厅演唱了012---l just don't think you should play at the restaurant anymore.
好的  没关系  我就…012---Okay. Fine, l'll just--
我把帽子拿回去退012---l'll take the hat back.
好了012---There.
嘿  我办公室发生一件最好笑...012---Hey, so, you guys, the funniest thing happened at work the--
我的歌不够格登上你们餐厅的大雅之堂吗012---My songs aren't good enough for your restaurant?
好吧  我们还在谈那个012---Okay, we're still on that.
我没有说它们不够格012---l didn't say they weren't good enough.
那有什么不对呢012---Then what's wrong with them?
是怎样  他们不够格配你的012---What, they don't go with your
一丁点份的自负的食物吗012---tiny portions of pretentious food?
-一丁点份  -是啊不好意思…012---- Tiny portions? - Yeah, well, ''Excuse me.
我点了熏鲑鱼开胃菜012---l ordered the smoked salmon appetizer,
但是我看不到鲑鱼  我看不到012---but l can't see it. l can't see it.''
菲比  份量不是最重要的012---Phoebe, it's not about quantity.
喔  品质也不是最重要的012---Well, it's not about quality.
真的吗  你想要谈品质吗012---Oh, really? You wanna talk about quality?
你有听过什么叫"调"吗012---Have you ever heard of a ''key''?
那是大家唱歌要对的012---lt's what some people sing in.
至少我所有的歌都没有大蒜味012---Well, at least all my songs don't taste like garlic.
是的  莫妮卡 还有其它的东西可以拿来调味的012---Yeah, there are other ingredients, Monica.
所以我们要这样做啰012---So that's what we're doing.
当我在咖啡厅里跟着你的歌打拍子时012---When l'm in a coffeehouse bopping along to one of your songs...
我是有戴耳塞的012---...l'm wearing earplugs.
是耳塞还是蒜头塞呢012---Earplugs or cloves of garlic?
你知道吗  我收回我所说的话012---You know what? l take back what l said before.
继续到餐厅演唱吧012---Keep playing at the restaurant,
因为你的音乐会把人逼进餐厅里...012---because with your music driving people inside...
我们吧台的营业量会疯狂激长的012---...my bar sales have gone up like crazy.
他们都点什么呢  蒜头马提尼吗012---What are people having, the garlic martini?
这是您的帐单012---Here's your bill.
希望您还住的愉快012---We hope you enjoyed your stay.
喔  我们很愉快012---Oh, we did.
而且你们的台灯都还在012---And you still have all your lamps.
我没有算进税金012---l didn't factor in the room tax.
兄弟  不用担心012---Dude, don't worry about it.
我找到了一台没人看管的女佣拖车012---l found an unattended maid's cart.
我们是居领先地位的012---We're way ahead of the game.
-喔  我的天 -怎样012----Oh, my God. -What?
那盆子里有新的东西012---There's something new in the bowl.
听着  我们拿够了  走吧012---Look, we have enough. Just walk away.
不  但是我想要松果012---No, but l want the pine cones.
外面就有一片森林012---There's a forest right outside.
那不一样012---lt's not the same.
好吧  快点012---Okay, go quick.
谢谢你们令人愉快的服务012---Thank you for a delightful stay.
我的枫糖糖果012---My maple candy!
吃了"家福"的餐  包你上西天012---Food here at 'Javu'.. will kill you..
吃了"家福"的餐  包你上西天012---the food here at 'Javu' ... will kill you..
原来是你  我还以为有人012---lt's just you. l thought someone
拿了一袋子的猫往墙上挥012---was swinging a bag of cats against the wall.
你最好回去厨房012---You'd better get back in that kitchen.
蒜头是不会自己多用自己的012---The garlic's not gonna overuse itself.
好了  你现在必须要停唱了012---Okay, you have to stop playing now.
为什么012---Why?
我的歌干扰到的人只有你012---The only person my playing is bothering is you.
是吗  我们来解决这件事  来吧012---Oh, yeah? Let's settle this. Come on.
把你的蒜头手拿开012---Get your garlic peelers off me.
不好意思  不好意思012---Excuse me? Excuse me?
我是莫妮卡·盖勒  这里的主厨012---Hi, l'm Monica Geller. l'm the head chef here.
好的  我本来真的希望有人鼓掌的012---Okay, l was actually expecting a little applause there,
但是没关系012---but whatever.
一个问题  请大家举手回答012---Quick question. By a show of hands...
你们有谁被这女人012---...how many of you were bothered
在外面唱歌干扰到呢012---by this woman's singing outside?
好的  好的012---Okay, okay.
你们有谁喜欢外面的音乐呢012---How many of you enjoyed the music outside?
让我问你们这个问题012---Let me ask you this question.
有谁认为音乐还好...012---How many thought the music was fine...
但是跟本餐厅的格调不符呢012---...but not in keeping with the tone of the restaurant?
好的  谁认为这个餐厅的格调是012---Okay, well, who identified this restaurant's tone as
"自以为是又充满蒜头味"呢012---''pretentious-comma-garlicky''?
好的  有谁觉得食物是很美味的012---Okay, who thinks the food is delicious
而一点点做作是没关系的012---and a little pretension never hurt anyone?
好了  没关系012---Okay, well, all right,
有谁觉得食物很好 音乐也很棒012---who thinks the food is fine, the music was fine...
但是你的晚餐已经012---...but your evening was ruined
被这个持续不断的民意调查给毁了012---by this incessant poll-taking?
不好意思012---Excuse us.
好了  我问你012---All right, here's a question.
有谁认为她的餐厅是那么的高级…012---Who was so worried about her restaurant being fancy...
让她过分的担心012---...that she made a big deal
她的朋友会演唱不适当的音乐…012---about her friend playing her music...
而现在真的觉得很难过呢012---...and feels really bad about it now?
有谁很愚蠢又很顽固...012---Well, who was so stupid and stubborn...
批评了她朋友的烹饪技术…012---...that she lashed out against her friend's cooking...
而其实她是觉得她的烹饪很好呢012---...which she actually thinks is pretty great?
我很抱歉012---l'm sorry.
我也很抱歉012---l'm sorry too.
嘿  你要不要留下来012---Hey, you wanna stick around
然后我帮你准备晚餐呢012---and l'll whip you up some dinner?
好啊  只要是免费的012---Yeah, as long as it's free.
这里的食物真的是超贵...012---The food here is ridiculously overpr--
谁希望举手这件事012---Who hopes the hand-raising thing
还可爱到使你不要恨我呢012---is still cute enough that you won't hate me?
嘿012---Hey.
嘿012---Hey.
乔伊  你的头后面有花生酱吗012---Joey, do you have peanut butter on the back of your head?
喔  天啊  我以为我都擦掉了012---Oh, man. l thought l got it all.
怎么会...012---How...?
怎么弄到的呢012---How?
我正在做花生酱冰沙012---l was making a peanut butter smoothie, right?
我找不到果汁机012---l couldn't find this little plastic thingy
上面那个小塑胶盖012---that goes in the top of the blender.
然后我想012---And l thought,
"那个小东西有什么重要的呢"012---''Well, you know, how important can that be?'' Right?
结果是非常重要012---Turns out, very.
哇  一定只是因为德雷克012---Wow, definitely just Drake.
什么012---What?
德雷克演得如何呢012---How's it going with Drake?
我想可能演的不是很好012---l don't think it's going very well.
什么012---What?
我看的那一场戏很好啊012---That scene l saw was so good.
我对明天要拍的那场戏012---Well, l'm feeling really insecure
觉得很没安全感012---about the one we're shooting tomorrow.
你是不是又故意说自己很糟012---ls this that thing you do
然后让我来赞美你呢012---when you say you're bad so l'll give you a compliment?
有点012---A little.
不  我是真的很担心012---No, l really am worried.
我必须要演得像是012---l have to make it convincing
我真的爱上奥莉维亚012---that l'm in love with Olivia.
所以呢012---So?
所以...我从来没有演过那种戏012---So l've never played that.
喔  亲爱的012---Oh, honey,
那不会很难的012---it can't be that hard.
你也有谈过恋爱啊012---l mean, you've been in love before.
嗯  只有一次...012---Well, just once...
就是跟你012---...with you.
好了  这实在是有点尴尬012---Okay. Well, this could be a little awkward.
我们跳过好了012---l'm just gonna blow past it.
听着  你何不运用你那个特殊方法012---Well, look, can't you just use that method-actor thing...
就是利用你的真实生活回忆012---...where you use your real-life memories
来帮助演出呢012---to help you in your performance?
你在说什么012---What the hell are you talking about?
好的  只要试着回忆起012---All right, look, just try to remember
你在谈恋爱时候的感觉012---how you felt when you were in love...
然后在演出的时候回想起那些感觉012---...and think about that when you're playing the scene.
好的  是啊  我想我做的到012---Okay. Yeah, l think l can do that.
好的  有个晚会的剧情012---Yeah. Okay, there's this party scene coming up.
奥莉维亚跟她老公就在那里012---And Olivia and her husband are there...
而德雷克想要做的只有抓住她012---...and all Drake wants to do is grab her
然后亲吻她  但是他不能012---and kiss her, but he can't.
那让我想起许多时候012---That makes me think about those times
我好想抓住你  然后亲吻你012---l wanted to grab you and kiss you...
但是你并不知道012---...but you didn't know,
所以我只能假装没事012---so l would just pretend everything was cool...
但这真的让我很受折磨012---...but really it was killing me.
乔伊  你从来没有说过这些012---Joey, you never talked about that before.
嘿  你知道我还可以用什么吗012---Hey, you know what else l could use?
有一场戏是德雷克012---There's this scene
偷偷溜进奥莉维亚的房间012---where Drake sneaks into Olivia's bedroom...
她不知道他就在那里012---...and she doesn't know he's there,
当然  我们之间没有发生过这样的事012---which never happened with us.
他知道他不应该去那里012---l mean, he knows he shouldn't be there,
但是他只想看看她012---but he just wants to look at her.
你知道吗012---You know?
而且我记得有好那些早晨012---And l remember all those mornings
就在你素颜时012---before you even put on your makeup...
我也会想"天啊  她真是美丽"012---...when l would think to myself, ''My God, she is beautiful.''
而且让我好心痛012---And it hurt so much because l knew
因为我知道我永远不能告诉你012---l could never tell you.
但是光是看着你012---But it was worth it
我就觉得心满意足了012---just to be there looking at you.
谢了  真是太棒了012---Thanks, dude. This is great!
我从佛蒙特州帮你带了些东西012---l got you something from Vermont.

我是十三岁时候来的  非常难过012---So l got it when l was 13. Very difficult.
罗斯  听着012---Hey, Ross? So listen,
关于你跟那个恐龙女生的事012---about you and the dinosaur girl?
你真的就要让几个诺贝尔奖012---Are you really just gonna
把你吓走吗012---let a couple of Nobel Prizes scare you off?
那是什么啊  不过是张纸吗012---What is that? Come on, a piece of paper?
事实上是一百万的奖金012---lt's actually a million-dollar prize.
查莉你真行012---Go, Charlie!
但是我的重点是...012---But my point is...
她是跟他们交往过012---...okay, so she dated them,
不过都分手了啊012---but she also broke up with them.
或许她正在寻找012---Maybe she's looking to, you know,
一般平凡的博士而已012---slum it with some average Joe Ph.D.
或许吧012---Yeah, maybe,
而我的事业正在发展中012---and l do have my whole career in front of me.
我是说...012---l mean....
我还是有可能赢得诺贝尔奖的012---l could still win a Nobel Prize.
虽然我上两份论文012---Although the last two papers l've written
被广泛地批评过012---were widely discredited.
你不只是聪明而已012---You're so much more than just brains.
你很贴心  很善良又很风趣012---You are sweet and kind and funny.
还有性感012---And sexy.

对  你说的没错012---Yeah. Yeah. You're right.
谢谢  我要去找她了012---Thanks. l'm gonna go find her.
太好了012---Good for you.
还有你关于泥盆纪时期突显均势的论文012---And your paper on punctuated equilibrium
是有很精辟见解的012---in the Devonian Era was topnotch.
不要再翻我的东西了012---Stop going through my stuff!
我只想让你知道012---l just wanted to let you know
我改变主意了012---l've changed my mind.
我要做了012---l'm gonna do it.
我要去亲乔伊012---l'm gonna kiss Joey.
不  你不行012---No! You can't!
朋友在一起是件坏事012---Friends hooking up is a bad idea.
拜托  那你跟钱德勒呢012---Please! What about you and Chandler?
那是不一样的  我喝醉了而且犯了傻012---That's different. l was drunk and stupid.
我也醉了啊012---Well, hello?
那些给你电话的男生呢012---What about all the guys that you got the phone numbers from?
你为什么不去亲其中一个012---Why don't you just kiss one of them.
我是可以…012---l could...
但是我不想  我想要亲乔伊012---...but l don't want to. l want to kiss Joey.
好吧  我认为这样是不对的012---All right. l think it's a big mistake,
但那是你自己的决定012---but it's your decision.
我要去做了012---l'm gonna do it.
而我无法阻止你吗012---And l can't stop you?
对012---No.
那至少把那些电话号码给我吧012---Well, can l at least have the phone numbers.
瑞秋012---Hey, Rach,
你有看到查莉吗012---have you seen Charlie anywhere?
我总比他聪明多了吧012---l'm smarter than him!
谢谢你送我们票  钱德勒012---Hey, thank you so much for these tickets, Chandler.
这对我是很重要的经历012---This was a really important experience for me
而我想跟你们分享012---and l wanted to share it with you.

真是太奇怪了012---lt's so weird.
乔伊昨晚最后怎么会去亲查莉呢012---How did Joey end up kissing Charlie last night?
我还以为最后会是你去亲查莉012---l thought you'd end up kissing Charlie.
我也这么以为啊012---l thought l'd end up kissing Charlie too.
但是...惊喜012---But surprise!
我错过了派对的大部分012---l missed most of the party.
查莉是女生  对吧012---Charlie's a girl, right?
是的012---Yeah,
她是刚到系上来的新教授012---she's this new professor in my department
而我却没亲到012---that l did not kiss.
我不知道为什么乔伊要亲她012---l don't know why Joey had to kiss her.
有这么多女生在派对上  天啊012---Of all the girls at the party, God!
你为什么这么在乎呢012---Why do you care so much?
是啊  瑞秋  你为什么这么在乎呢012---Yes, Rachel. Why do you care so much?
因为罗斯是我孩子的爹012---Because Ross is the father of my child.
你知道的  而我希望他可以有机会012---You know, and l want him to
跟很多女人交往012---hook up with lots of women.
我的意思是说012---All l'm saying is,
我不认为乔伊跟查莉012---l don't think that Joey and Charlie
有任何相同之处012---have anything in common.
我不知道012---l don't know.
他们似乎对彼此的扁桃腺012---They seemed to have a shared interest
有相同的兴趣012---in each other's tonsils.
哇  乔伊跟大学教授012---Wow. Joey and a professor.
你们能想像万一他们有小孩吗012---Can you imagine if they had kids?
如果小孩子遗传到她的智慧...012---And if the kids got her intelligence...
还有乔伊的原始性吸引力...012---...and Joey's raw sexual magnetism...
那些书呆子就可以随时来一炮了012---...those nerds would get laid!
好了  罗斯你对这一切都无所谓么012---All right. So, Ross, you're okay with all this?
我是说...012---l mean....
又没有什么大不了的012---lt's no big deal.
我才刚认识她012---l just met her.
我没事的012---l'm fine with it.
天啊  我忘了她有多辣了012---God, l forgot how hot she was.
我去再倒一杯咖啡012---l'm gonna get some more coffee.
喔  我跟你去012---Oh, you know, l'll come with you.
好的012---Okay.
跟教授搞上了012---So a professor, huh?
是啊  她真酷  而且很聪明012---Yeah. She is cool. And she's so smart.
她的头脑是完全的"尖酸刻薄"012---Her mind is totally acrimonious.
她好像不是那样用这个词的012---Guess that's not how she used it.
我觉得我应该向你解释...012---l feel like l owe you an explanation.
我通常不会在派对上乱亲男生的012---l don't ordinarily go around kissing guys at parties.
我...012---l'm....
嗯  我有点难为情012---Well, l'm kind of embarrassed.
我希望你不会因此而瞧不起我012---l really hope you don't think less of me.
瞧不起你012---Think less of you?
我不会瞧不起你的012---No. l don't think less of you.
我是说  你看到喜欢的人012---l mean, you saw someone you liked
然后你亲了他012---and you kissed them.
那些有喜欢的人012---Those people who like someone
却又不亲他们的人...012---and don't kiss them...
那些人是白痴012---...those people are stupid.
我恨死那些人了012---l hate those people.
事实上  我自己也是很惊讶012---Actually, l'm a little surprised at myself.
我是说  乔伊跟我以前012---l mean, Joey's so different from
交往的人太不同了012---the guys l usually date.
他们全都是教授  高级知识份子012---They're all professors, intellectuals.
大部分是古生物学家012---Paleontologists mostly.
你知道的  非常有理智...012---You know, very cerebral--
是的  我知道那一类型的人012---Yeah, l know the type.
如果你想要在上班前先吃点东西012---lf we want to grab a bite before work,
我们最好赶快"尖酸刻薄"012---we'd better get acrimonious.
不对吗  意思很接近吧012---No? Am l getting close?

她也想去打猎哦012---She wants to go hunting too!
菲比  别这样  我不想浪费掉它012---Phoebe, come on, l don't want to waste it.
这就好像是白白丢掉一百块012---lt would be like throwing away 100 bucks.
这跟钱无关  好吗012---Okay, this is not about the money. Okay?
这跟大企业贪婪毁灭我们的心灵...012---lt's about corporate greed destroying our hearts...
然后让我们只剩下空空的躯体有关012---...and leaving us hollow shells.
我根本不在乎那些012---l don't care about any of that.

在那边有间很棒的面包店012---And there, there's this great little pastry shop

现在  记住012---Now, remember,
当你进入博物馆时...012---when you get to the museum...
莫内的拼法不是"M-O-N-A-Y"   我刚刚...012---...Monet is not spelled M-O-N-A-Y. l just--
帮你用注音写下来了012---l wrote that out phonetically for you.
注音012---Phonetically?
是的  意思是...012---Yeah, that means--
我们没有时间讨论那些了012---We just don't have time for this.
我得说我真的很惊讶012---l gotta say, l'm really impressed
你可以这么快速012---you were able to memorize
背下这些东西012---all this so quickly.
我是演员  我可以背下任何东西的012---l'm an actor. l can memorize anything.
上星期在《我们的日子》剧中  我必须得说012---Last week on Days, l had to say:

哇  那是什么意思呢012---Wow. What does that mean?
鬼知道012---No idea.
但是那个被我那样说的男的012---But the guy l said it to
在下一场就死了012---dies in the next scene...
所以我想那可能是说012---...so l guess it means,
"你会被熊给吃了"012---''You'll get eaten by a bear.''

接下来才是最困难的部份012---The hard part's what comes next.
你难道不担心结果吗012---Aren't you worried about the results?
我根本没有想过结果012---l haven't even thought about the results.
我只是以为一切都会没事012---l just assumed everything would be okay.

你为什么会那样觉得呢012---And why do you think that is?
我不知道012---l don't know.
或许是因为她的手指都起了老茧了012---Maybe it's because she's got such callousy fingers...
大概是练弹烂吉他而来的012---...from playing crummy guitar.
或许因为她很难放松你的筋骨012---Or maybe she has trouble loosening your knots...
因为你真是个难搞的俏屁股012---...because you're such a high-maintenance tight-ass.
菲比012---Phoebe!

是很罪恶的事  那你就要012---feel guilty for getting a free massage.
小费还是要照算的012---Tip's not included.
为什么你不敢说你在这里工作呢012---Why did you lie to me about working here?
因为我觉得很丢脸  好吗012---Because l was ashamed, okay?
我为五斗米而折腰012---l sold out for the cash.
他们提供一些福利012---And they give me benefits,
有医保还有退休金012---like medical and dental and a four-oh-wunk.
但是你知道的  要付出代价的012---But, you know, you pay a price.
现在我成了大公司的傀儡012---Now l'm this corporate stooge...
每天打卡上班012---...and punching a clock...
然后还要缴税012---...and paying taxes!
菲比  亲爱的  如果你这样痛恨这工作...012---Phoebe, honey, if you hate it so much...
你应该马上走出去然后辞职012---...you should walk out there right now and quit.
相信你所坚信的理念012---Be true to what you believe in.
亲爱的  你是有原则的人012---Honey, you have principles,
所以我很钦佩你的012---and l so admire that.
我才是没有原则012---l don't have any.
你知道吗  你说的对012---You know what? You're right.
我要去辞职012---l am gonna quit.
该是我重新把生活找回来的时候了012---lt's time l took my life back.
很好  菲比012---Good for you, Pheebs.
如果你们在里面也有装麦克风012---lf you guys have microphones in there too,
我在里面说的都不是真心的012---l didn't mean any of that.
我爱你们012---l love you.
打到了  死吧  死吧  死吧012---Got you! Die! Die! Die!
诚挚地  盖勒教授敬上012---Respectfully, Professor R. Geller.
嘿012---Hey.
嗨012---Hi.
嘿  大都会好玩吗012---Hey, how was the Met?
博物馆真的很惊人012---The museum was amazing.
是啊  乔伊真的很懂艺术不是吗012---Yeah, Joey really knows his art, huh?
并不尽然  不012---Not so much, no.
很明显地他清楚地背下了要说的东西...012---He had clearly memorized all this stuff to say...
但是很多东西都很不对劲012---...and some of it didn't even make any sense.
你是什么意思呢012---What do you mean?
嗯  例如...012---Well, for one...
他谈论的都是根本012---...he was talking about paintings
不在展出的绘画012---that were nowhere around.
等等012---Wait a minute.
你们进入博物馆之后012---When you guys walked into the Met,
是往右边走吗012---did you go to the right?
不不  我们往左边走012---No. No, we went to the left.
喔  乔伊  乔伊  乔伊012---Oh, Joey, Joey, Joey.
可是你们看起来也是012---Still, it seems like you guys are
玩得很开心啊012---having a great time together.
是啊  是很好玩012---Yeah. Yeah, it's fun.
怎么012---What?
事实上  乔伊是你的朋友...012---Actually, Joey's your friend...
而你也不是很了解我012---...and you don't know me that well.
这会很奇怪的012---lt'd be weird.
嗯  可能会有点012---Well, l mean, a little.
但是不会啦  怎样呢  跟我说012---But no, what? Go on.
嗯...012---Well....
我在想或许012---l'm thinking that maybe Joey isn't
乔伊不是很适合我012---the right guy for me right now.
你知道的012---You know,
或许我应该跟...012---maybe l should be with someone...
跟我比较相像的人在一起012---...l have more in common with.
你知道我的意思吗012---You know what l mean?
是啊012---Yeah.
是啊  但是你知道吗012---Yeah, but you know what?
我想你应该给乔伊一个机会012---l think you should give Joey a chance.
我是说他是个好男人012---l mean, he's a great guy.
当然他是不知道很多艺术的东西012---And sure, he doesn't know that much about art...
但是你可以跟其他知道的人谈论啊012---...but you can always talk about that with someone else.
我想也是012---l guess that's true.
如果你仔细想想...012---lf you think about it...
他背下所有的东西只是因为012---...he memorized all that stuff
他认为那些东西对你很重要012---because he thought it was important to you.
你知道的  乔伊就是那样子的人012---You know, that's the kind of guy Joey is.
他是非常贴心的012---He is very sweet.
还有  他真是帅毙了012---Plus, he is hot!
这就是我下一个要你给他机会的原因了012---That was gonna be my next argument.
你准备好了吗012---You ready?
好了  我们走吧012---Yeah. Let's go.
哇012---Wow!
谢了  罗斯012---Thanks, Ross.
不客气012---Yeah.
嘿  罗斯  艺术那些东西真是有效012---Hey, Ross. That art stuff worked.
你真帮了大忙012---You hooked me up.
很高兴能够帮上忙  兄弟012---Glad l could help, man.
有些你说的东西并没有在那里012---Some of the stuff wasn't where you said it would be,
但是我都搞定了012---but l made it work.
现在看到这个就冲动是不合理的012---lt is not okay that l'm aroused by this now.
哈啰012---Hello?
喔  嗨  唐纳利医生012---Oh. Hi, Dr.Connelly.
不  她现在不在...012---No. Well, she's not here...
但是我可以转告她012---...but l can tell her.
我应该先坐下来再听吗012---Should l be sitting down for this?
那  那是什么意思呢012---Well, so, what does that mean?
好的  好的  谢谢你012---Okay. Okay, thank you.

唐纳利医生刚刚打电话来012---Dr.Connelly just called.
有好消息吗012---With good news?
当然不是好消息啰012---Of course it's not good news.
你是说"唐纳利医生刚刚打电话来"012---You said, ''Dr. Connelly just called.''
如果是好消息你会说012---lf it was good, you'd have said,
"唐纳利医生刚刚打电话来"012---''Dr. Connelly just called!''
那  是怎样呢  是不是...012---So, what is it? ls it...?
有问题吗012---ls there a problem?
是我的问题还是你的呢012---ls there a problem with me, or with you?
事实上我们两个都有问题012---Actually, it's both of us.
什么012---What?
很显然地  我的精子活动力太低了012---Apparently, my sperm have low motility...
而你有不适于着床的环境012---...and you have an inhospitable environment.
那是什么意思呢012---Well, what does that mean?
意思就是说我的人根本没有办法出兵...012---lt means that my guys won't get off their Barcaloungers...
而你的子宫已准备好012---...and you have a uterus
要杀死入侵的小兵了012---that is prepared to kill the ones that do.
意思是012---lt means--
等等  钱德勒012---Wait, Chandler.
意思是我们可以继续尝试...012---lt means that we can keep trying...
但是我们很有可能永远都不会怀孕012---...but there's a good chance this may never happen for us.
喔  我的天012---Oh, my God.
我很抱歉012---l'm sorry.
我也很抱歉012---l'm sorry too.
嗯...012---Well...
我们会想出办法的012---...we're gonna figure this out.
我知道012---l know.

所以你需要有很了解012---So you need someone who knows fashion
时尚的人来给你建议012---to tell you what looks good.
不要是我...012---Not me...
嘿  瑞秋012---Oh, hey, Rach?
怎样012---Yeah?

喔  嗯…012---Oh, well....
你可能很忙没空吧012---l'm sure you have better things to do.
你在开玩笑吗012---You kidding?
瑞秋爱死逛街了012---Rachel loves to shop,
而且她品味极佳012---and she has great taste.
就是她教我在劳动节之后012---She's the one that taught me,
不要穿白色衣服012---you don't wear white after Labor Day...
而且永远永远记住012---...and to always, always, always
在试穿衣服时一定要穿内衣裤012---put on underwear when trying on clothes.
如果你有空012---lf you have the time,

我问过他了012---l asked him
完全不介意见到你"012---and he's totally okay with seeing you.''
所以现在我一定得去了012---So now l have to go so he'll think
以便让他感觉我完全不介意见他012---that l'm totally okay with seeing him.
你根本就很介意012---Which you're not.
因为你还没有忘记他012---Because you're hung up on him.
没错012---Exactly.
你想要他懊悔不已012---You want him to eat his heart out,
所以你一定要看起来艳光四射012---so you have to look fabulous.
我根本没有那样想过012---l didn't even think about that.
性别政治012---Sexual politics!
菲比  我要带查莉去逛街012---Pheebs, l'm taking Charlie shopping.

我们没有要那样做012---That's not what we're gonna do.
你为什么要打断我012---Why'd you ruin it?
我这么想会伤害到谁012---Who was l hurting?
《老友记》  第九季 第22集  精子捐献者012---Friends S09E22 The One With The Donor
还好她长得很漂亮012---Fortunately, she has a very pretty face.
我还是无法相信012---l still can't believe this.
我的子宫是不适着床的环境012---My uterus is an inhospitable environment?
我一直都很努力012---l've always tried so hard
想要当个称职的女主人012---to be a good hostess.
我不敢相信我的精子的活动力太低012---l can't believe my sperm have low motility.
告诉你  当我在长大的时候012---Because let me tell you, while l was growing up,
它们倒是等不及要到处去游玩012---they sure seemed to be in a hurry to get places.
嗨012---Hi there.
嗨012---Hi.
关于你们上星期的测试我很抱歉012---l'm sorry there wasn't better news
没有什么更好的消息012---from your tests last week...
但是我想要跟你们谈谈012---...but l wanted to talk to you
你们可有的选择012---about your options.
好的012---Okay.
首先012---Well,first of all.
虽然你们以正常方式012---Even though your chances of conceiving
受孕的机率很低…012---through natural means aren't great...
但是很难定论的012---...you never know,
所以你们还是持续进行性生活012---so keep having sex on a regular basis.
哦  不要012---Oh, damn it!
别担心012---Don't worry.
等一下你就会习惯了012---After a while, you'll tune it out.
在这种情况之下012---Given your situation,
最佳的选择就是…012---the options with the greatest chances for success...
代孕母亲或是经由捐赠精子受孕012---...would be surrogacy or insemination using a sperm donor.
好吧012---Ok.
如果你们认为上述012---lf you feel that neither of those
两种选择都不适合012---is right for you,
你们还是可以选择领养012---you could always adopt.
这是个暗示吗012---ls that a hint?
我们是很爱你的  唐纳利医生012---Because we love you, Dr.Connelly,
但是我们不想要领养你012---but we don't want you to be our child.
喔012---Wow!
还说别人的环境不好客012---Talk about an inhospitable environment.
嗨  你准备好要去接菲比012---Hi. Okay, you ready to go pick up Phoebe
逛街了吗012---and go shopping?
我们走吧012---Let's do it.
好的  祝你们逛得愉快012---All right, have a good time.
那里面是找不到衣服的012---Not gonna find any clothes in there.
你们好012---Hey, you guys.
嗨012---Hi.
猜猜看谁是012---Guess who's up for keynote speaker
全国古生物学大会的主讲人012---at the National Paleontology Conference?
克里斯·培利012---Chris Bailey?
对啊  是啊012---Yeah, right.
他上次准时提交012---When was the last time
摘要是什么时候呢012---he made a submission deadline for an abstract?
你为什么要笑呢012---Why are you laughing?
只是想了解一下012---Just seeing what it'd be like
当古生物学家是怎样的012---to be a paleontologist.
真好玩  是啊012---lt's fun. Yeah.
所以你要当主讲人012---So you're up for keynote speaker?
是谁做的决定呢012---Who's deciding?
薛曼教授012---Professor Sherman.
我今天要跟他见面012---l'm meeting with him today.
要想感动他可不容易012---He's a pretty tough guy to impress.
我知道怎么让他惊奇012---l think l know how to dazzle him.
你应该不会是要变个魔术012---You're not gonna to do a magic trick,
对吧012---are you?
不是012---No.
大家好012---Hey, guys.
等一下012---Wait a minute, you guys.
我想要问你们一个问题012---l want to ask you something.
我可能会在这个古生物学大会演说012---l may get to speak at this paleontology convention.
如果是这样  我想邀请你们012---lf l do, l'd love for you guys
来听我的演讲012---to come and hear me.
我想我们肯定会因为有家庭012---l think l can safely say that
工作或是身体不适等理由而去不成012---we all have family issues, work and/or are sick.
是在巴巴多斯012---lt's in Barbados.
但是你是最重要的012---But you come first.
我去定了012---l'm there.
待会见012---See you later.
好的  拜012---Okay, bye.
拜  再见012---Bye. See you.
拜012---Bye.
验孕诊所怎么说012---So how did it go at the fertility clinic?
不像上次一样好玩012---Not as much fun as last time.
很明显地  他们只有在采精子样本时012---Apparently, you only get porn
才会给你看色情书刊012---if you're giving a sperm sample.
那医生怎么说呢012---So, what did the doctor say?
可以用代孕母亲  但莫妮卡这一辈子012---There's surrogacy, but Monica's dreamt
都在梦想怀孕…012---her whole life of carrying a child...
而她会觉得看着代孕母亲怀孕012---...and she just felt that watching
对她而言会太难受了012---a surrogate would be too hard for her.
所以你们不考虑代理孕母012---So you're ruling out surrogacy?
没错012---Yeah.
所以我不用知道那是什么意思012---So l don't have to learn what that means?
除了领养外012---Aside from adoption,
剩下的选择就是接受精子捐赠012---the only other choice is insemination...
所以我们现在在讨论精子捐赠者的事012---...so we're talking about sperm donors.
够了  我随时为你效劳  兄弟012---Enough said. l'm there for you, man.
她在哪  楼上吗012---Where is she, upstairs?
那你的感觉呢012---So how do you feel about all this?
我真希望我们有012---l wish there was an easier way
更简单的方式可生孩子012---for us to have a child,
但是我们并没有选择012---but there isn't one.
别这样  罗斯  做做好人012---Come on, Ross, be a good guy.
挺身而出吧012---Step up and do it.
什么012---What?
什么  不   我不会把本给他们的012---What?! No! l'm not gonna give them Ben!
我们从核磁共振成像012---The data we're receiving
跟脱氧核糖核酸测试所取得的化石...012---from MRl scans and DNA testing...
资料数据是很惊人的012---...of these fossils are staggering.
我的意思是我们一直以来都将012---l mean, we've been accepting
李奇年代法视为理所当然012---Leakey's dates as a given.
但是如果它的误差012---But if they're off
即使只有十万年左右…012---by even a 100,000 years or so...
那你可以舍弃我们大部分推论…012---...then you can just throw most of our assumptions...
你知道的  丢到垃圾桶里012---...you know, right in the trash.
所以  我要说的是…012---So, what l'm saying is....
是…012---ls that....
是所受影响的后果是很大的012---ls that repercussions could be huge.
我是说  不只是在古生物学012---l mean, not just in paleontology,
但是如果你仔细想想…012---but if you think about it...
甚至是在进化生物学  基因学  地质学012---...in evolutionary biology, genetics, geology.
我是说  真的  无限想像的空间012---l mean, truly, the mind boggles.
嗯  结果不该是这样的012---Well, that's not what you want.
试试"男人的诱惑"香水012---lncentive for Men?
我要喷一点012---l'll take some of that.
菲比  那是男生的香水012---Pheebs, that's for men.
我知道012---l know.
在我等一下去派对时...012---When l go to the party later...
迈克会知道我已经忘了他了012---...Mike will know l'm over him
因为我闻起来会有另一个男人的味道012---because l'll smell like another guy.
好了012---Okay.
太好了  我在跟俄罗斯计程车司机约会012---Oh, good, l'm dating a Russian cabdriver.
拜托  有人买这个吗012---Seriously, does anyone buy this?
这闻起来像是甜菜012---l smell like beets.
你知道吗012---So, you know what,
我真的很喜欢012---l really like those jackets
那些有垫肩的外套012---with the shoulder pads in them.
你觉得哪里有呢012---Where do you think those would be?
梅兰妮·葛丽芬在《上班女郎》里面穿的012---On Melanie Griffith in Working Girl.
我想你适合穿的在这边012---l think what you want is over here.
我就知道  我需要有人帮我012---See, l told you l needed someone.
对了  为了要谢谢你012---By the way, as a thank you,
我真的很想请你吃饭012---l would really love to take you out.
真的吗012---Really?
是啊012---Yeah!
乔伊跟我012---Actually Joey and I
今晚要去看电影012---are going to the movies tonight,
你想要一起去吗012---wanna come?
我不行012---Oh, l can't.
因为我看过了012---Because l've seen them.
你已经看过所有的电影了012---You've seen all the movies?
是啊  我是铁杆粉丝012---Yeah. l'm a big fan.
电影的012---Of the movies.
移动的画面012---You know, motion pictures.
有声电影012---The talkies.
瑞秋012---Rach,
你可以跟我进去试衣间试穿吗012---will you come with me to a dressing room?
当然012---Sure.
好的012---Okay.
或许我们可以做别的事012---Maybe we could do something else.
你知道的  那要看是什么事012---You know, that depends on what it is.
很多东西我都做过了012---l've done a lot of stuff.
你刚刚是怎么了012---So, what were you doing out there?
你不喜欢查莉吗012---Do you not like Charlie?
她还好啦012---She's okay.
我不知道012---l don't know,
我只是跟她不投缘吧012---l just don't get a really good vibe from her.
为什么012---Why?
我不知道012---l don't know.
你知道的  只是她的一举一动012---You know, just the way
聪明的要命...012---she waltzed in here all smart...
而且又高挑  你知道的...012---...and tall, you know...
让乔伊拜倒在她的石榴裙下012---...and just swept Joey off his feet.
别人都没有机会012---Nobody else has a chance.
还有谁呢012---Who else?
任何人啊012---Anybody.
你  我012---You. Me.
你知道的  莫妮卡的妈012---You know, Monica's mom.
你喜欢乔伊012---You like Joey?!
菲比012---Phoebe!
好吧  你说的没错012---All right, look, l do.
我对他是有一点点感觉  只是...012---l have a little thing for him. Just--
喔  我的天啊012---Oh, my God.
是肉欲的012---lt's just physical.
我已经完全控制住了  好吗012---l have it totally under control, okay?
只是当我看到他们在一起...012---lt's just when l see them together...
有时候  我就会有点忌妒012---...sometimes, l just get a little jealous.
哇  好讽刺喔  他以前喜欢你过012---Wow. lsn't that ironic that he liked you,
然后现在你喜欢…012---and now you like--?
我知道012---l get it!
好吧  一切都控制住就好了012---All right, as long as it's under control.
你不可以采取任何行动012---You can't do anything about it.
他已经跟她在一起了012---He's already dating her.
她是个好人012---She is a nice person.
那是不对的012---That wouldn't be right.
我知道  我知道  所以没事啦012---l know, l know. So it's just not a big deal.
你可以不要说出去吗012---So can we keep this between us?
当然012---Sure.
太好了  因为我得出去了012---Great, because l gotta get out of here.
我快被甜菜味熏死了012---The smell of beets is killing me.
查莉可能会有耳聋的双胞胎妹妹吗012---Any chance Charlie has a deaf twin?
嗨  亲爱的012---Hi, honey.
嘿012---Hey.
我带个朋友回来吃晚餐012---l brought a friend home for dinner.
这是我同事柴克012---This is Zack from work.
当然啦012---Oh, of course.
很高兴再见到你  柴克012---lt's so nice to see you again, Zack.
我也是012---You too.
你们并没有见过面012---You guys haven't actually met before.
天啊  你们还真有礼貌012---But, boy, you're both polite.
请坐  我帮你拿啤酒012---Have a seat. l'll get you a beer.
我来拿012---l got it.
谢谢012---Thanks.
柴克不错吧012---So Zack's pretty nice, huh?
是啊  应该吧012---Yeah, l guess.
那你想不想要生个小孩012---So how would you like to have a baby
一半儿你的  一半儿他的012---that's half yours and half his?
什么012---Excuse me?
我们在讲的是精子捐赠者012---We're talking about sperm donors,
而柴克或许就是适当的人选012---and Zack may be the guy.
他很聪明  健康012---Look. He's intelligent, he's healthy,
体格强壮012---he's athletic.
我是说  他是最佳"精"选了012---l mean, he's sperm-tastic!
钱德勒  这太疯狂了012---Chandler, this is crazy.
你是怎么跟他说的012---Well, what did you even say to him?
"上来看看我老婆012---''Come up. Meet my wife.
给我们你的精子"012---Give us your sperm.''
我邀请他来吃晚餐012---l invited him to dinner
让你有机会了解他012---so you'd get a chance to get to know him.
如果我们去精子银行012---I mean, if we go through with a sperm bank,
我们根本不能见到那个捐赠者012---you never meet the guy,
也查不到他的底细012---get to check him out.
钱德勒012---Chandler!
我告诉你  他非常棒012---l'm telling you, he's great.
我是说  即使我的精子没有问题012---l mean, even if my sperm worked fine,
我也认为我们应该选择他012---l think he'd be the way to go.
这事情我不参加012---l'm not going to be a part of this.
你不能随便带个男的回来012---You can't bring some random guy home
就想让我接受他当精子捐赠者012---and expect him to be our sperm donor.
好吧012---Okay.
柴克012---Zack?
谢谢012---Thanks.
你有杯垫吗012---Do you have a coaster?
我不想在桌上留下印记012---l don't want to make a ring.
跟我说说你的情况  柴克012---Tell me about yourself, Zack.
天啊  你觉得她听到了吗012---Oh, God, do you think she heard?
如果她听到就惨了012---lt'd be so bad if she heard.
或许她没有听到012---Maybe she didn't hear.
我到隔壁间说话012---l'll go into that dressing room and talk.
你待在这里012---You stay in here.
看看你是不是可以听到我说话012---and I'll talk and see if you can hear me.
好的012---Okay, great.
噢  感谢上帝012---Oh, thank God,
我听不到你说话012---l can't hear a word that you're saying.
我还没有开始说话012---l didn't say anything yet.
那回去里面然后说话啊012---Well, get back in there and talk.
我是瑞秋012---l'm Rachel.
让艾玛在电话上012---lt's so annoying
跟我朋友讲话012---when l put Emma on the phone
真的很讨厌012---to talk with my friends.
什么012---What?
有些事是很难012---Well, some things are just hard
当你的面说的012---to say to your face.
好吧  我听到了012---Okay, well, l heard that.
表示她也听到了012---Which means that she heard it too.
我们有麻烦了012---We have a problem.
我们该怎么办呢012---Oh, what are we gonna do?
就老实跟她说吧012---Just be honest with her.
噢  我的天啊012---Oh, my God!
父母让婴儿听电话012---And it is annoying when parents
的确是很讨厌012---put their baby on the phone...
好了  你说够了012---All right, enough out of you!
喂012---Hello?
我要跟查莉讲话012---l need to talk to Charlie.
她在吗012---ls she there?
不在  她跟瑞秋去逛街了012---No, she went shopping with Rachel.
找她干嘛  怎么了012---Why? What's up?
我正在跟薛曼教授012---l'm meeting with Professor Sherman
讨论关于我当主讲人的事012---about my being the keynote speaker.
进行的如何呢012---How's it going?
可以更顺利的012---lt could be better.
他睡着了012---He fell asleep.
什么  但是我已经012---What? But l already bought
订了到百慕大的机票了012---my ticket to Bermuda!
是巴巴多斯012---Barbados.
好啦  我再租车开过去012---Fine, l'll rent a car and drive.
你一定要得到这工作012---You have to get that job.
我应该怎么办呢012---What am l supposed to do?
他完全睡着了012---He's out cold.
事实上012---ln fact,
刚刚他还在说梦话012---he was just talking in his sleep before...
而且他还要一个叫法兰的人012---...and evidently he wants someone named Fran
"再打大力点"012---to ''spank him harder.''
那叫醒他吧012---Well, just wake him up.
不可以012---l can't.
如果他发现我是让他睡着的人012---lf he realizes that l'm the one
我就得不到这个工作了012---who put him to sleep, l won't get the job.
那倒是挺难的012---That's a tough one.
等等012---Oh, wait a minute.
这以前也发生在我身上过012---This happened to me before.
是啊  我之前在试演一出戏剧的时候012---Yeah, l was auditioning for a play,
那个制作人睡着了  我...012---and the producer fell asleep. l--
不  等等012---No, wait a minute.
其实是我睡着了012---lt was me who fell asleep.
我是说  莎士比亚012---l mean, hey, Shakespeare,
来点动作场面吧012---how about a chase scene once in a while?
嘿  晚餐好了012---Hey, guys, dinner's ready.
我先去洗手012---l'm gonna go wash up first.
谢了012---Thanks.
你觉得呢012---What do you think?
我要我的孩子有他的基因012---l want his genes for my kid.
那双眼睛  那颧骨012---Those eyes, those cheekbones.
好了  你要分清你是过度狂热012---Okay, there's enthusiastic,
还是你是个同性恋012---and there's just plain gay.
你不喜欢他012---You don't like him.
我觉得他还不错012---l think he's fine.
但是我们对他了解不够012---But we don't know anything real about him.
我希望我们可以知道多一点012---l wish we could get more information.
好的  跟着我的话锋转012---All right, just follow my lead.
你们家真是好棒012---You guys have a great place here.
谢谢  我很喜欢这地方012---Thanks. l'm crazy about our place.
嘿  说到疯狂...012---Hey, speaking of crazy...
你们家有人012---...do you have a history
有人得过精神病吗012---of mental illness in the family?
没有  但是我是有个叔叔012---No. Although, l did have an uncle
投票给杜凯吉斯012---who voted for Dukakis.
那真的不是我们012---That's really not the kind of thing
期待的  柴克012---we're looking for.Zack.
好的012---Okay.
告诉我  你们是怎么认识的呢012---So tell me, how'd you guys meet?
刚开始是朋友  在伦敦喝醉012---Oh, friends first, drunk in London,
你知道的012---you know the story.
我有个更棒的问题要问你012---l've got a better question for you:
你或是你的血亲012---Do you or any of your
有人有糖尿病吗012---blood relatives have diabetes?
没有012---No.
心脏病  老年痴呆症  痛风012---Heart disease? Alzheimer's? Gout?
你们不常请朋友012---You guys don't have people
到家里用餐  是吗012---for dinner a lot, huh?
我们只是在找话题聊聊012---We're just making conversation.
好吧  我今天听到一个笑话012---Yeah, well, okay. l heard a joke today.
真的是挺好笑的012---lt's pretty funny.
你知道有什么是不好笑的吗012---You know what's not funny?
雄性秃头012---Male pattern baldness.
你们今晚对我很有兴趣012---You guys have shown a lot of interest in me tonight,
我很受宠若惊012---and l'm flattered...
而且老实说  是有点害怕012---...and quite frankly, a little frightened.
我们可以聊聊别的话题吗012---Can we just talk about something else?
当然012---Sure.
好的012---All right.
这个意大利小方饺真是美味012---This ravioli's delicious.

不  没有012---No, l didn't.
太好了012---Yes!
我们很重视牙齿的  柴克012---We're teeth people, Zack.
好吧  我们就这么做了012---All right.Let's just do it.
我们过去问她有没有听到012---Let's just go over there and see if she heard.
好主意012---Good plan.
好的012---Okay.
什么  你要去哪012---What? Where are you going?
对不起  瑞秋012---Oh, l'm sorry, Rachel.
我没有时间012---l don't have time
玩你的幼稚游戏  好吗012---for your childish games, okay?
我还得要找到012---l still have to find
很惊艳的衣服穿012---something incredible to wear...
那我才可以在"谁先忘了谁"上012---...so l can beat Mike
打败迈克012---at ''Who's More Over Who'' !
你去哪里了012---Where have you been?
去试穿衣服012---Trying on clothes.
真的吗  在试衣间吗012---Oh, really? ln the dressing room?
喔  真奇怪012---Well, that's so weird.
菲比跟我刚刚也在试衣间012---Phoebe and l were in the dressing room.
天啊  这世界真是小012---Gosh, it's just such a small world.
瑞秋  我听到你们俩的对谈了012---Rachel, l heard you two guys whispering.
天啊  你听到了012---Oh, God, you did, you heard.
好的  听着  让我解释012---Okay, look, let me explain.
没有必要解释012---There's nothing to explain.
我都听到了012---l heard you.
菲比喜欢乔伊012---Phoebe likes Joey.
是啊012---Yeah.
我不明白012---l don't understand it.
我是说菲比喜欢乔伊012---l mean, Phoebe likes Joey...
可是她却来买衣服012---...and then she's here to buy a dress
来惊艳另一个男人012---to impress another guy?
是啊  菲比就是那样012---Yeah, that's Phoebe.
她就是那样 你知道的012---That's Phoebe. You know,
她就是全部都要012---she just wants them all.
那就像是女花痴012---lt's, like, she's nympho.
哇012---Wow!
是啊012---Yeah.
对了  另外012---You know, by the way,
我有听到你告诉她不可以做任何事012---l heard you tell her not to do anything.
谢谢你替我说话012---Thanks for sticking up for me.
天啊  你真是个好人012---God, you are such a nice person.
我尽量012---l try.
我的天啊  你真的要我012---Oh, my God, you really want me
当主讲人吗012---to be the keynote speaker?
谢谢你012---Thank you!
不用客气012---You're welcome.
哇  你辣到...012---Wow! You look...
都能让我把手里的食物放下了012---...stop-eating hot!
这是最高阶段的辣哦012---Which is like the highest level of hotness.
你确定吗012---Okay, are you sure?
因为我真的很恐惧这场派对012---Because l am really dreading going to this party.
那就别去啊012---Then don't go.
迈克知道我要去012---Mike knows l'm coming.
如果我没出现012---lf l don't show up,
他会以为那是因为他...012---he'll think it's because of him...
我那样就会很没面子012---...and then l'm gonna lose face.
这对我来说是很严重的事012---That's a very serious thing in my culture.
好吧  那就去派对吧012---All right, then you go to that party,
然后假装已经完全忘记迈克了012---and you pretend to be over Mike.

跟那个迈克在一起012---with that Mike guy...
然后我告诉自己  "天啊  我也想要那样"012---...and l just said, ''Boy, l want that.''
麦克跟我分手了012---Mike and l broke up.
你在开玩笑吧012---You're kidding me.
因为我没有在跟谁交往012---Because l'm not seeing anybody.
我完全是编出来的012---l just totally made that up.
真的吗012---Really?
我不知道为什么瞎编012---l don't know why,
我很抱歉012---l'm sorry.

是啊  好的  那...012---Yeah. Okay. So then, okay....
我们都住在纽约012---So we're both living in New York,

嗯  这或许是个蠢问题012---Well, this is probably a stupid question,
看到你穿这样...s012---seeing that you look like that...

不了  我应该要回家了012---No, l should get home.
我有点累012---l'm kind of tired.
你是刚感觉累吗012---Are you just tired now?
还是一直都感觉累012---Or are you always tired?
因为这很有可能是012---Because that could be
忧郁症的前兆012---a sign of clinical depression.
不  只是要想出我祖父母012---No, it's tiring to figure out the age at
是几岁过世的让我很累012---which all my grandparents died.
明天见012---l'll see you tomorrow.
好的012---Okay.
再见012---Bye.

我要开口问他吗012---Should l ask him?
不要012---No.
为什么呢012---Why not?
就只因为012---Just because his
他曾祖母有肥胖症吗012---great-grandmother was obese?
反正我们的孩子也是会从你那遗传到的012---Our kid's gonna get that from you anyway.
不  不是那个原因012---No, that's not it.
只是在我们问他012---lt's just that when we were asking him
那些问题时…012---all those questions before...
我意识到我并不在乎012---...l just realized l don't care
他是不是世上最完美的男人012---if he is the most perfect guy in the world.
他不是你012---He's not you.
是啊  他比我更好012---Yeah, he's better!
不  他不是012---No, he's not.
如果我不能跟你怀孕012---lf l can't get pregnant with you,
我也不想跟他...012---then l don't want to get pregnant by him...
或是跟任何人012---...or anyone else.
真的  你确定吗012---Really? Are you sure?
是的  我确定012---Yeah, l'm sure.
感谢上帝012---Thank God,
因为我也不想这样做012---because l don't wanna do this either.
我会这样做012---l was just doing it
是因为我以为你想这样012---because l thought that was what you wanted.
我是丈夫012---You know, l'm the husband.
我理当要提供精子的012---l'm supposed to bring the sperm.
这实在是很体贴012---That is so sweet.
我爱你012---l love you.
所以你知道我们唯一的选择就只剩...012---So you know this leaves us with....
领养012---Adoption.
你觉得如何呢012---How do you feel about that?
我想我没问题012---l think l feel okay about it.
事实上我觉得非常的好012---Actually, l think l feel really good about it.

我想找到一个需要家庭温暖的小孩012---l wanna find a baby that needs a home,

然后我想用我们012---And l wanna mess it up
自己的方式来乱养他012---in our own specific way.
我们就这么决定了012---So this is it?
我们真的要领养012---We're really gonna adopt?
是的012---Yeah.
我的天  我们要当父母亲了012---Oh, my God! We're gonna be parents!

我们的孩子可能正被受孕012---...our baby could be being conceived.
等等  如果我们够幸运012---Wait. lf we're lucky,
而且我们真的  真的  真的很安静…012---and we're really, really, really quiet...
我们或许可以听到012---...we may be able to hear

我以为我们可以在一起坐会闲聊呢012---l thought we could hang out.
我不行  我整天都有研讨会012---l can't. l have seminars all day.
我答应罗斯我会看看他的演说稿012---l promised Ross l'd look at his speech.

在阳台外面012---Out on the balcony?
会很浪漫的012---lt'll be romantic.

我不知道...012---l don't know what's gonna happen...

我知道  想要个提示吗012---l do. Want a hint, huh?
我知道（我愿意）012---l do.
我知道012---l do.
好的  我可以感到012---Okay, l'm sensing this is
这是什么文字游戏的012---some kind of wordplay...

大卫要跟菲比求婚了012---David's gonna propose to Phoebe.
什么  为什么012---What? Why?
因为我们本来在谈012---Because we were talking about ways

他们才交往几个星期而已012---They've only been going out for a few weeks.
菲比还无法忘记迈克012---Phoebe is completely hung up on Mike.
我想她会拒绝的012---l mean, she'll say no...
然后大卫会心碎012---...David's heart will be broken,
他们会很难复合012---it'll be too hard for them to recover...
菲比最后又落得孤零零一个人012---...and then Phoebe will end up alone again.

我未婚夫总是跟012---My fiance was always going on
他的"网球球友"一起度周末012---long weekends with his ''tennis partner.''
我老婆有年跟一个朋友012---My wife had a workout friend
天天都到健身房健身012---she went to the gym with every day for a year.
她也没有变瘦012---She didn't get any fitter.
每个人都说"我早就知道了"012---Everybody's like, ''l knew all along.''
我知道 如果知道  怎么不告诉我呢012---l know. lf you knew, why didn't you tell me?
我是说只要打电话  给个纸条012---l mean, call, leave a note.
"嗨  只是过来告诉你 你老婆是同性恋"012---''Hi. Just dropped by to say your wife's gay.''
我知道012---l know.
然后...012---And then--
然后你试着在困境中求生存...012---And then you try to make the best of a bad situation...
所以你提出三人行的建议012---...so you float the idea of a threesome.
我没有那样做012---l didn't do that.
我也没有012---Me neither.
谁会知道呢012---Well, who knew?
药剂师们真好玩012---Pharmacists are fun.

你别想轻易躲掉012---You're not getting away that easy.
你喜欢谁呢012---Who do you like?
乔伊  别这样012---Joey, come on!

晚安  罗斯012---Good night, Ross.
我不敢相信她会答应大卫012---l can't believe she's gonna say yes to David.
她很明显还是爱着迈克012---She's clearly in love with Mike.
你看起来这样子012---You know, it's very hard to
实在很难把你的话当真012---take you seriously when you look like that.
菲比  有些话我要跟你说012---Phoebe, l have something l want to say.
天啊  他要开口了012---Oh, God, he's gonna do it.
我看不下去  我们走012---l cannot watch this. Let's go.
我想我们还有时间012---l think we have time.
你有听过他说话吗012---Have you heard him talk?
"菲比  我将会很荣幸如果..."012---''Phoebe, l would be honored if--''
说快点  大卫012---Spit it out, David!
菲比012---Phoebe.
你实在是太好了012---You're an amazing woman,
我们分开的时候实在无法让人忍受012---and the time we spent apart was unbearable.
当然明斯克卫生设施员工的012---Of course, the sanitation strikes
罢工让情况更糟012---in Minsk didn't help.
当然  好的  是的012---Sure. Okay. Yeah.
但是现在我们又一起了012---But, well, now that we're together again,
我再也不想分开了012---l don't ever want to be apart.
所以...012---So to that end....
我的天啊  迈克012---Oh, my God, Mike.
事实上  我是大卫012---lt's David, actually.
不  迈克在这里012---No, Mike's here.
嘿  迈克012---Oh, hey, Mike.
嗨  大卫012---Hi, David.
钱德勒  莫妮卡... 哇012---Chandler. Monic-- Oh!
是湿气012---lt's the humidity!
嗨  菲比012---Hi, Phoebe.
你在这里做什么呢012---What are you doing here?
我有个问题必须要问你012---l have a question l need to ask you.
我也有个问题012---l have a question
要问她012---l was kind of gonna ask her myself.
我了解  但是在你那样做之前012---Yeah, l understand, but before you do,
她真的需要先听我说012---she really needs to hear this.
好的012---Okay.
你要坐我的座位吗012---Would you care for my seat as well?
事实上会很好012---Actually, yeah, that'd be great.
很公平012---Well, that's fair,
你一路这么远赶来012---you've had a long trip.
菲比  我爱你012---Phoebe, l love you.
在过去几个月里012---l've missed you so much
我非常想念你012---these last few months.
我原以为我们分开是有好理由的012---l thought we were apart for a good reason...
但是我发现012---...but l realized that
根本没有够好的理由...012---there was no reason good enough...
能够让我不与你012---...to keep me from spending
共度下半辈子012---the rest of my life with you.
有点毁了我将要说的话012---Kind of steps on the toes of what l was going to say.
抱歉  大卫012---l'm sorry, David,
但是她真的有需要知道这些012---but she really has to know this.
好的  但是之后012---All right, when you're through,
我要在外面跟你单挑012---l want to see you outside.
如果外面停止下雨的话012---lf it stops raining.
你是我遇过最不可思议的女人012---You're the most incredible woman l've ever met.
我怎么能够失去你呢012---How could l lose you?
我现在并没有戒指012---Now, l don't actually have a ring.
我有戒指012---l have a ring.
我不会在这时候炫耀  老兄012---l wouldn't brag about that, big guy.
但是  菲比...012---But, Phoebe...
你愿意嫁给我吗012---...will you marry me?
不012---No.
我爱你012---l love you,
但是我从不需要你求婚012---but l never needed a proposal from you.
我只需要知道我们之间是有发展的012---l just needed to know we were headed somewhere.
我们是有未来的012---That we had a future.
我们可以有任何你想要的未来012---We can have any future you want.
好的  我要走了012---Okay, well, l'm gonna take off.
大卫  我很抱歉  我好抱歉012---David, l'm so sorry. l'm sorry.
让我知道一下  如果我先问了012---Just so l know, if l had asked first...?
我有可能会答应012---Yeah, l might have said yes,
但是那是不对的012---but that would've been wrong.
你不用解释  没关系012---Please, you don't have to explain.
我是说  如果我当初没有去明斯克...012---l mean, perhaps if l hadn't gone to Minsk...
我们之间可能就没问题了012---...things would have worked out for us,
而我也不会毁了我的事业012---and l wouldn't have ruined my career.
或是因冻疮而失去那根脚趾012---Or lost that toe to frostbite.
这旅行还不错012---lt was a good trip.
我现在可以拥抱你吗012---ls it okay if l hug you now?
喔  可以012---Oh, yes.
就是因为我们的多管闲事  好吗012---Because of our meddling! All right?
这样不是很好吗012---Oh, isn't this nice?
如此安静  我可以整天都躺在这里012---lt's so quiet. l could just lie here all day.
我知道012---Oh, l know.
打开窗帘  打开窗帘012---Open your drapes! Open your drapes!
我们的房间是相通的还真不错呢012---So glad we got adjoining rooms.
太阳出来了012---The sun is out!
嘿  记得我看得到的时候吗012---Hey! Remember when l had corneas?
赶快去游泳池占位子012---Go to the pool and reserve chairs.
我会拿杂志跟防晒乳液012---l will get the magazines and the lotion.
罗斯的演讲再四十五分就开始了012---Ladies? Ross' speech is in 45 minutes.
不012---No!
该死的012---Damn it!
墙壁很薄的  你们这些人012---Walls are pretty thin, guys.
我们必须考量最近磁共振造影资料012---''Then we have to weigh the data from recent MRl scans
与去氧核糖核酸测试资料...012---and DNA testing...
而这些对多年来的碳年代012---...which call into question information
测定资料收集方式形成了一些疑点012---gathered from years of carbon dating.''
瞧瞧那个坐在游泳池畔012---Look at the woman sitting out
享受日光浴的女人012---by the pool getting tan.
她的皮都有皱纹了012---She's all leathery and wrinkled.
我真是忌妒012---l'm so jealous!
最后  有最近 许多丰富新物种的发现012---''Finally, factor in the profusion of new species recently discovered.
巨兽龙012---Giganotosaurus.
阿根廷龙012---Argentinosaurus.''
更不用提冷龙012---Not to mention Coldsaurus.
而这些只是草食性的012---''And that's just the herbivores.
我还没有要提到肉食性的012---l'm not even gonna discuss the carnivores.
他们的头都已经是太大了012---Their heads are already too big.
这是蛮讽刺的012---Which is ironic,
因为他们的大脑却是发育不良的012---considering their stunted cerebral development.''
真的吗012---Really?
但是撇开玩笑不谈012---''But all kidding aside,
这是相同于...012---in much the same way...
匠人曾被认为是直立人的012---...that Homo ergaster is thought to be
另一个分支012---a separate species from Homo erectus....''
什么012---What?
他说"勃起"（erectus:直立人  还有勃起的意思）012---He said "erectus."
你在开玩笑吗012---You're kidding, right?
不  他是真的那样说012---No, he really said it.
而当然有许多很大的差异...012---''And while there are certainly vast differences...
介于这些中生代化石012---...between these Mesozoic fossils
跟此直立人例子012---and the example of Homo erectus....''
勃起？012---Erectus?
同性恋（Homo:人属中的一支  也有同性恋的意思）012---Homo.
没错012---Right.
"用非常真实的方式012---''ln a very real way,
我们可以将中生代时期012---we can bring the Mesozoic Era
带入二十一世纪"012---into the 21 st century.''
谢谢012---Thank you.
真的很棒012---Really great.
谢谢你们012---Oh, thanks, guys.
我认为很精采012---l thought it was wonderful.
我是杰维斯·欧伯劳 康乃尔大学012---Jarvis Oberblau. Cornell.
你突显出来的议题012---l mean, the ideas you put forth,
尤其是你是这样的年轻而且...012---and from someone so young and....
好的  现在我们只是在握着手012---Okay, now we're just holding hands.
好的  我们要去海滩了012---Alrighty. We're gonna hit the beach.

放轻松点012---Take it easy.

我无法告诉你012---l can't tell you how much it means
你们在此对我意义有多大012---that you were here.
你在开玩笑吗  我们不可能会错过的012---You kidding? We wouldn't have missed it.
我回来了012---l'm back.
好的  失陪一下好吗012---Okay. Well, excuse me?
怎么样012---Well?
你真是不可思议012---You were incredible.
你完全迷住了他们了012---You blew them away.
我无法告诉你在人群中012---l can't tell you how great it was
看到你的脸有多棒012---to look in the crowd and see your face.
我是说 你知道你嘴巴012---l mean, did you know you were
在跟着我念吗012---mouthing the words along with me?
我没有012---l was not.
不  没关系012---No, it's okay.
那让我觉得很像摇滚巨星012---lt made me feel like a rock star.
我的天啊012---Oh, my God.
我跟你是流行乐迷（groupie:想与流行乐队成员发生性关系的少女）012---l'm your groupie.
我最好不要在房间里012---Hey, l better not find you naked
发现你脱光光喔012---in my hotel room.
哎呀  我又扯太远了012---Look, l took it too far.
我不敢相信又在下雨了012---l can't believe it's raining again.
真是不公平012---lt's so unfair.
往好处想012---Well, on the bright side,
就是我们不用看到...012---now we won't have to see...
那些古生物学家脱掉上衣012---...all these paleontologists with their shirts off.
不是你们012---Not you guys.
你们还不错012---You've got it going on.
我们今天要做什么呢012---What will we do today?
他们楼下有游戏间012---They have a game room downstairs.

我们来玩012---Let's play.
我想不好012---l don't think so.
为什么不要012---Why not?
你知道你得失心很重的012---You know how competitive you get.
我以前说那样很可爱012---And while l say it's cute,
可是别人都不同意  而且我在说谎012---others disagree, and l'm lying.
我又不是永远都那样糟糕012---l'm not always that bad.
是吗012---Oh, yeah?
我们上次玩的时候发生什么事呢012---What happened when we played last time?
我揍了你012---l punched you.
还有呢012---And?
还有菲比012---Phoebe.
还有呢012---And?
我把你们的头撞在一起012---l clunked your heads together.

嘿  听着012---Hey. Listen.
只要一停雨012---As soon as it stops raining,
我们一定要去潜泳012---we have got to go snorkeling.
有个小孩告诉我有海龟012---Some kid told me about this sea turtle.
如果你对着他的脸吹气泡...012---lf you blow bubbles in his face...
他会追着你跑喔012---...he chases you.
我很抱歉  我不能去012---l'm sorry, l can't.
我整个下午都要主持一个讨论组012---l'm running a discussion group all afternoon.
没关系  我找别人去好了012---That's okay. l'll find someone else to do it.
我是可以一个人去  但是...012---l'd do it alone, but...
我不知道海龟012---...l don't know what happens
如果抓到我会发生什么事012---if the sea turtle catches you.
我觉得很糟糕012---You know, l feel so bad.
我整趟旅途都没有跟你在一起012---l haven't seen you this whole trip.
尤其是昨晚...012---Especially last night--
不用担心  没关系012---Don't worry about it. lt was fine.
我跟瑞秋玩得很开心012---l end up had the best time with Rachel.
我只是为你难过012---l just felt bad for you,
跟罗斯关在房间里赶演讲稿012---stuck in that room working on Ross' speech.
事实上  还蛮好玩的012---Actually, it turned out to be a lot of fun.
那至少012---Oh, well, at least
我们都过得很愉快  不是吗012---we're both having fun, right?
我们不在一起却很快乐  很怪吧012---ls it weird that it's not with each other?
是啊012---Yeah.
有一点  是啊012---A little bit, yeah.
我想我们需要谈谈012---l think we need to talk.

好啦012---All right.
不计分我才要玩012---l'll play if we don't keep score.
那我们怎么知道谁赢呢012---Well, then how do we know who wins?
没有人会赢012---Nobody wins.
所以我们是四个输家  太好了012---So we're just four losers. Super.
我不要跟她玩012---Well, l'm not playing with her.

我只是...012---l just....
或许你并没有一直都012---Okay. Maybe you're not always
在追不适合你的女生012---going after the wrong girl.
我告诉你  瑞秋012---l'm telling you, Rach,
查莉并不适合我012---Charlie is not right for me.
我不是在说她012---l'm not talking about her.

多久了呢012---Well, for how long?
大概只有一个月012---Oh, only like a month.
一个月012---A month?
嗯...012---Well--
小声点012---Dial it down.
或许只是一些疯狂的想法012---Listen, maybe they're crazy thoughts,
但是有时候我就是会想啊012---but sometimes l do.
我一直在想我们之间的可能性012---l have been thinking about, you know, us.
好的  现在音调提高一点012---Okay, dial it up a little.
你说的对  好的012---Oh, you're right. Okay.

你倒底是在做什么012---What the hell are you doing?

只是当我们在一起时012---lt's just, we have such a good time
非常地快乐  你知道吗012---when we're together, you know?
你难道都没有好奇过012---And l mean, aren't you just a little curious

他还有个纸路线图012---He had a paper route.

这就是我说的012---See, this is what l'm talking about.
我知道  我们棒透了012---No, l know. We're great!
但是瑞秋  不  不能这样的012---But, Rach, no, this can't happen.
不能有一点点机会吗012---Can't it just happen a little bit?
不  一点也不行012---No! lt can't happen at all!
为什么不行012---Why not?
因为  你看012---Because, look,
我最希望事情是这样了  好吗012---no one wants this to happen more than me, okay?
我在我脑海中已经幻想过012---l have gone over this moment
这情节一百次了012---in my head 100 times...
而且我从没拒绝过012---...and not once did l ever say no.
我不能这样对罗斯012---l couldn't do it to Ross.
但之前却不是这样012---But that wasn't gonna stop you before.
我知道...012---l know. l know...
但是在那之后我想了很多012---...but l've thought about it a lot since then,
这是不对的012---and it just wouldn't be right.
我很抱歉012---l'm sorry.
我也很抱歉012---l'm sorry too.
天啊  我不应该说出来的012---Oh, God, l shouldn't have said anything.
不...012---No, no.
别这样  我们没事的012---No, no, no, no. Hey, we'll be fine.

你要告诉我你现在没有012---Are you telling me you're not even a little turned on
被莫妮卡撩的心痒痒的012---by Monica right now?
这是婚后我第一次觉得012---This is the first time in our marriage
我是比较有魅力的那一个012---that l've felt like the more attractive one.
好了  加油  迈克012---All right, come on, Mike.
