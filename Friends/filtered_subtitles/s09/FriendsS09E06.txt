这样真好  我知道012--- This is nice.  I know.
你需要两只手才打得开吗012---You need both hands for that?
是啊  真得要012---Yeah,I kind of do.
嗯  那这样呢012---Well,how's this?
瞧瞧你们两个 手握着手012---Look at you two holding hands.
是不是开始认真了呢012---Is this getting serious?
你们有没有谈过呢012---Have you not talked about it yet?
我是不是让你们很不舒服呢012---Am I making you uncomfortable?
如果你再高壮一点  就会扁我了吧012---If you were bigger you'd hit me.
不好意思  不好意思012---I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
很明显  现在就讨论那种事012---It's obviously way too early for us
对我们而言是太早了012---to be having that conversation.
会吗  或许不会  会吗012--- Is it?  Maybe not. Is it?
当我离婚后012---When I got divorced..
我以为很长一段时间内012---I didn't think I'd feel this way
我都不会对任何人有这种感觉了012---about someone for a really long time.
而且  我也不认为012---Then again,I didn't think
会遇到像你这样的人  而且012---I'd meet someone like you. And..
这或许太疯狂快速了012---This may be crazysoon,
但我希望给你这个012---but I want you to have this.
不  这是口香糖012---No,not.. That's gum.
噢  五块钱012---Oh,five bucks!
我超喜欢这种事发生的  你知道吗012---I love it when that happens,you know?
你不知道兜里有钱012---You don't know it's there..
我知道  继续挖012---I know. Keep digging.
抱歉012---Sorry.
是一把钥匙012---It's a key.
老实说  我宁可要那五块钱012---To be honest,I think I'd prefer the five dollars.
我公寓的钥匙  哇012--- It's to my apartment.  Wow!
菲比跟麦克  两人关系的一大步012---Big step for Phoebe and Mike.
听着  我不希望你觉得012---Yeah, look, I don't want you to feel like
你也要给我你的钥匙012---you have to give me your key..
就因为...012---Just because...
不  我要  感谢上帝012--- No,I want to.  Thank God.
哇  我本来还在想012---Wow. I was starting to think
我应该不会遇到一个人012---I'd never meet someone that..
让我想要这样做的012---I wanted to do this with.
拿去吧012---Here you go.
太酷了 真的是很酷012--- This is cool.  It really is.
我知道  太惊人了012---I know it. It is amazing.
这些小东西可以把门打开012---These little things open doors!
我四星期之后才需要回去上班012---So I don't go back to work for another four weeks..
但是我们希望我们的保姆可以马上上班012---but we would like our nanny to start right away..
让艾玛有时间可以熟悉她012---so that Emma could get a chance to know her.
我觉得这样做是很聪明的012---I think that's really smart.
我们交接的过程越容易  对她越好012---The easier we can make the transition for her the better.
太棒了  很好012---That's great. Great.
那你有没有什么问题想问我们呢012---So do you have any questions for us?
没有012---Not really.
好了  那谢谢你跑这么一趟012---All right. Well,thank you so much for coming.
谢谢  很高兴认识你012--- Thank you.  It was really nice to meet you.
我们会打电话给你  等一下012--- We will call you.  Oh,you know,wait.
我是有一个问题012---I do have one question.
你们会不定期对人做毒品测试吗012---Do you guys do random drug testing?
天啊  我们还真的没想过这个012---Boy,we hadn't really thought of that.
没关系  但是如果你们要求做012---That's cool. But if you do,
我需要你们提前三天告诉我012---I'm gonna need three days' notice.
好的  没问题012---Okeydokey!
我们永远都找不到保姆了012---We're never gonna find a nanny.
别这样  瑞秋012---Come on,Rach.
我保证我们会找到的012---We will. I promise.
我们还有其他的面试012---We have more interviews.
就算糟糕到极点012---Worse comes to worst,
我们总是可以重新考虑第一个人选012---we can always reconsider the first one we met with.
什么  那个没穿胸罩的金发女郎吗012---What,the blond with no bra?
她的头发是金色的吗012---She was blond?
等一下012---Just a sec.
好的  接下来的应聘者叫桑迪012---Okay,this one's name is Sandy.
她有幼儿教育学位012---She's got a degree in Early Childhood Education.
她在上个家庭做了三年保姆012---She worked for her last family for three years.
嗨  我是桑迪012---Hi. I'm Sandy.
而且她看起来有点男性化012---And she's a little mannish.
噢  我的天  大卫012---Oh,my God! David!
现在会打扰你吗012---Is this a bad time?
不  现在很好  进来吧012---No,it's a great time! Come in!
天啊  你来这里做什么呢012---Oh,my gosh! What are you doing here?
你从明斯克回来了吗012---Are you back from Minsk?
只回来几天012---Just for a couple of days.
我是回来跟提供基金的人解释012---I'm here to explain to the people who gave us our grant..
为什么我们花光了所有他们给的钱012---why it's a positive thing that we've spent all their money..
却毫无成果  是件好事012---and accomplished nothing.
谁在乎呢  反正你回来了012---Who cares? It got you here.
剩的钱足够我买机票飞到纽约012---It got me to New York anyway.
然后在机场叫了部计程车012---Then I got in a cab at the airport..
司机问我要去哪012---and the guy said,"Where to?"
我就给了他你的地址  想都没想012---I just gave him your address. I didn't even think about it.
你的行李呢012---Where's your luggage?
该死012---Damn it.
好了  我来打电话给计程车公司012---All right,I'll call the cab company.
等等  我们可以等一下再打012---Wait, wait, We can call them later.
你可以先站在那边一会儿吗012---Can you just stand there for a moment?
天啊012---Boy.
有一句俄罗斯老谚语是这样的012---There's an old Russian expression that goes:
大致的翻译就是012---Roughly translated,that means:
"我现在盯着的东西  哇"012---"This thing that I'm looking at: Wow."
谢谢你012---Thank you.
你应该看看当我012---You should see me when..
事实上  不用  我看起来挺不错的012---Actually,no,I look pretty good.
你在开玩笑吗012---Are you kidding?
你知道的  当很久没有见到一个人012---You know,when you don't see someone for a long time..
你会在脑海中建立起这个人的影像012---you build them up in your head,
然后开始想012---you start thinking:
"少来了  别发神经了012---"Come on,don't be crazy,
没人是那样美的"012---nobody's that beautiful."
但是  你真就那样美012---But,well,you are.
那么  你现在有在跟谁交往吗012---Well,so are you seeing anyone?
没有012---No.
我是有史以来最糟糕的人012---I'm just the worst person ever!
我怎么可以不告诉大卫012---How can I not tell David
我跟麦克在一起呢012---that I'm seeing Mike?
或许他没有给你机会说012---Maybe he didn't give you a chance.
他问我有没有跟谁交往  而我说没有012---He said,"Are you seeing someone?" and I said,"No."
本来你是可以趁机告诉他的012---Well,that would've been your window.
我也不知道怎么回事  我看着他的双眼012---I mean,I don't know. I was looking in his eyes..
然后只能想012---and I was just thinking,
"我的天  是大卫  大卫回来了"012---"Oh,my God,it's David. David's here."
他真是令人无法抗拒012---He's so irresistible.
不是吧  那个科学家012---Really? The scientist guy?
不是吧  钱德勒012---Really? Chandler?
继续说012---Continue.
然后越来越糟糕012---Then it gets worse..
因为我答应他  明晚跟他见面012---because I told him I would see him tomorrow night.
菲比 我知道  太差劲了012--- Phoebe!  I know! Evil!
我真的好喜欢麦克012---I like Mike so much,you know?
发展得真的很顺利  我的天012---It's just going really well. Oh,my God!
真是讽刺  大卫居然出现在012---Isn't it ironic that David would show up..
你和麦克交换钥匙的同一天012---on the same day that you and Mike exchange keys?
是啊  而且012---Yeah. You know,
我一辈子都在找寻讽刺的事012---and given my lifelong search for irony..
你可以想像我有多开心012---you can imagine how happy I am!
你要怎么办呢  我想我只能012--- What are you gonna do?  I mean,I guess I just have to..
告诉大卫我们之间是不可能的012---tell David that nothing can happen between us.
除非我不告诉他012---Unless I don't.
你知道的  复杂的道德情况012---You know,complicated moral situation?
没有对错之分012---No right,no wrong?
你必须告诉大卫012---You have to tell David.
好吧  我就知道我该去问乔伊才对012---Ok, I knew I should've had this conversation with Joey.
她遇过的最风趣的男人012---Funniest guy she's ever met.
我很风趣  不是吗012---I'm funny,right?
你知道个什么  你只是一道门012---What do you know? You're a door.
你就像是"敲敲门"的笑话012---You just like knockknock jokes.
等到里面再发挥012---Save it for inside.
奥克拉荷马真是疯狂012---So Oklahoma's a crazy place.
他们把那里称为先锋之州012---You know,they call it the Sooner State.
老实说  我宁愿早"先"一点搬到别的州012---Frankly,I'd sooner be in any other state!
而且奥克拉荷马为什么有个平底锅柄呢012---And what's with Oklahoma having a panhandle?
其它的州可以有像那样的东西吗012---Can all states have stuff like that?
嘿  我是从怀俄明州的腰部来的012---Hey,yeah,I'm from the waistband of Wyoming.
但是当我7岁的时候012---But when I was 7,
我们就搬到胯下部了012---we headed over to the crotch.
你坐的机舱是不是压力太大012---Was your cabin pressurized?
而且别让我开口吐槽012---And don't get me started on the way
塔尔萨人说话的方式012---the people from Tulsa talk.
好的012---Okay.
"你全"到底是个什么词呢012---What's with the word "y'all"?
只不过是"你们"跟"全部"加在一起012---You know,just two words just pushed together?
我们可以那样做吗012---Are we all allowed to do that?
因为如果可以  还有很多字可以这样玩012---Because if so,I say why stop there?
你的"新狮子狗" 可以变成你的"新狮"012---You know,your new poodle could be your noodle.
"油炸鸡块"可以变成"炸块"012---And fried chicken could be fricken.
服务生  服务生012---Waiter? Waiter,
不好意思  我想要点"炸块"012---excuse me,I'll have the fricken!
瞧  "炸块"很好笑吧012---See,that's funny with the fricken,right?
不  只是让我想起012---No,it just reminds me
今天工作时  有个人讲的笑话012---of something this guy did today at work.
我有跟你提过012---I told you about
一个叫杰弗瑞的风趣的人  对吗012---that funny guy,Jeffrey,right?
是啊  你提过012---Yeah,he came up.
他说了一件好笑的事012---Well,he did this bit.
你应该要在现场才感受的到012---You probably had to be there..
说的是莉莎·明妮莉被锁在冰箱里012---but it was Liza Minnelli locked in our freezer
吃生鸡肉012---eating a raw chicken.
你在现场吗012---Were you there?
没有  但听起来"炸"好笑012---No,but it sounds fricken funny.
我真的可以理解012---I really understand
要把孩子交付给另一个人是很困难的事012---how hard it's gotta be to leave your child with another person.
我是说  那就像把心上的一块肉割下012---I mean,it's like leaving behind a piece of your heart.
桑迪  你说的对极了012---Sandy,that's exactly what it is.
你是同性恋吗012---Are you gay?
没关系  我的工作常引来误会012---It's okay. I get that a lot doing what I do.
但我不是同性恋  事实上我已经订婚012---But I am straight. I'm engaged,actually.
未婚妻名叫狄莉亚  真是好名字012--- Her name's Delia.  That's pretty.
所以你只是一个当保姆的男人012---So you're just,like,a guy who's a nanny.
我知道这对一些人来说是很颠覆传统的012---I realize how it's a bit unorthodox for some people.
但我真的相信012---But I really believe
人一辈子能做的满足感最强的事012---the most satisfying thing you can do with your life..
就是照顾孩子012---is take care of a child.
好吧012---Okay.
就像我上一任工作012---Like at my last job.
我在丹尼尔三星期大的时候就认识他012---I met Daniel when he was 3 weeks old.
然后我看着他长大成一个很棒的人012---And I got to watch him grow into this awesome person.
当我离开的时候012---When I left,
我说  希望很快再见到你012---I said,"I'll see you soon."
然后他说  "桑卡爹迪"012---And he said to me,"Skadandy?"
那是他给我取的名字012---That was his name for me.
"我每天都会看到你在"012---"I'll see you every day right in.."
没关系012---It's okay.
是啊  小孩子尽会说些鬼话012---Yeah,kids say all kinds of crap.
天啊  她一定是需要换尿布了012---Oh,God,she must need her diaper changed.
我可以帮你处理  如果你愿意的话012---I can take care of that,if you want.
太棒了012---That would be great.
我爱他  我爱他  我爱他012---I love him,I love him,I love him!
别这样  瑞秋  他是个男人012---Come on. Rach,he's a guy!
那又如何  他很聪明  资历又符合012---So what? He's smart. He's qualified.
给我一个理由为什么我们不能试用他012---Give me one good reason we shouldn't try him out.
因为这实在太奇怪了012---Because it's weird!
为什么012---Why?
男人做那种工作像话吗  保姆012---What kind of a job is that for a man? A nanny?
我是说  那就像一个女人想要成为012---I mean,it's like if a woman wanted to be..
什么012---Yes?
国王012---King?
我希望你不介意012---I hope you don't mind.
我在艾玛身上用了我自制的乳液012---I used some of my homemade lotion on Emma.
是混合金盏花跟蜂蜜的乳液012---It's a mixture of calendula and honey cream.
对红疹是立即见效的012---It'll dry that rash right up.
而且  使双手保持年轻012---Plus,it keeps the hands young.
真棒  桑迪  你被录取了012---Yes! Sandy,you're hired!
太棒了012---That's great!
不好意思012---I'm sorry.
只是被欢迎加入一个新家庭012---It's just such an emotional thing
是一件很令人感动的事012---when you're welcomed into a new family.
噢  天啊  过来这里012---Oh,God. Come here.
你至少也是双性恋012---You gotta be at least bi.
我需要你搭档讲个笑话012---I need you to set me up for a joke.
待会儿等莫妮卡在的时候012---later when Monica's around,
你要问我消防车怎样012---I need you to ask me about fire trucks.
我不知道  钱德勒012---I don't know,Chandler.
我不是很会记台词的012---I'm not so good with remembering lines.
感谢上帝  你不是靠记台词吃饭的012---Thank God your livelihood doesn't depend on it.
我知道  棒吧012---I know,right?
我们为什么要这样做呢012---Why are we doing this?
莫妮卡说他们餐厅的领班012---Monica says that her maitre d'
是她遇过的最风趣的男人012---is the funniest guy she's ever met.
真的吗  她真的那样说012---Seriously? She actually said that?
是的  我很愤怒  是不是不对劲012---Yes. Am I crazy to be this upset?
不  风趣是你的专利  是啊012--- No! Being funny's your thing!  Yeah!
没有了它  你还有什么吸引女人的012---Without that,you just got "lame with women"!
嗨  你们都在012---Hi! There you are.
消防车012---Fire trucks!
哇  你看起来比昨天更美丽012---Wow. You look even more beautiful than you did yesterday.
事实上  我现在要亲你012---In fact,I'm going to kiss you now.
等等  我就是没有办法012--- Wait,wait.  I can't get away with stuff like that.
在我脑海中听起来很性感  所以我012---It sounded sexy in my head,so I..
不  不是那个原因012---No,no,it's not that.
你记得当你问我有没有跟谁交往012---Remember when you asked me if I was seeing someone
而我告诉你没有吗012---and I said no?

我要你过得幸福012---I want you to be happy.
但是只能跟我012---But only with me.
不  那并不公平012---No,that's not fair.
管他的  离开他吧012---Who cares. Leave him.
我不是那个意思012---I don't mean that.

跟你坦白012---telling you this
是我做过的最困难的事012---is one of the hardest things I've ever had to do.
我也想告诉你012---Well,just so you know..
听到此事可不像在过嘉年华012---hearing it wasn't exactly a Vladnik carnival,either.
我们至少可以拥抱道别吧012---Can we at least hug goodbye?
当然  可以012---Of course. Yeah.
你知道的  在脸颊上亲一下012---You know,and a kiss on the cheek
应该也不算太不适当012---wouldn't be totally inappropriate.
不  不 我是说012--- No. No.  I mean..
在明斯克  怎样呢012--- In Minsk?  Yeah?
是在两边各亲两下012---It's two on each cheek..
还有一下亲在唇上012---and one on the lips.
好吧  如果那是明斯克的习俗012---Well,if that's what they do in Minsk.
在纽约  是012---In New York,it's..

桑迪只是在告诉我012---Sandy was just telling me
他是如何向他未婚妻求婚的012---about how he proposed to his fiancee..
实在是太美了012---and it was so beautiful.
她最喜欢的花是山茶花 从那首诗012---Her favorite flower is the camellia. From the poem..
我没办法再听一次012---I can't hear it again!
我也没办法再说一次012---You know,I can't tell it again!
我一遍没听过也挺好的012---And I'm fine never having heard it.
瑞秋  我可以跟你谈谈吗012---Rach,can I see you for a sec?
好啊  失陪了012---Yeah. Excuse me.
你有发现那男人012---Do you realize that man
在我们家已经哭过三次了吗012---has cried in our apartment three times?
我从搬进来之后也没哭过那么多次012---I haven't cried that many times since I moved in!
听着  罗斯  桑迪只不过是很敏感012---Look,Ross,Sandy's just sensitive.
仅此而已012---That's all.
好了  看吧  那就是个问题012---Okay,okay. See,that is the problem.
他太敏感了012---He is too sensitive.
太敏感就不能照顾我们的小孩吗012---Too sensitive to take care of our baby?
不  我是说  那个男的012---No,I mean,that guy..
真是太好吃了012---These are amazing!
桑迪做的饼干012---Sandy made madeleines.
我想说的正是这个012---This is exactly what I'm talking about.
什么样的男人会做精致的法式饼干呢012---What kind of a guy makes delicate French cookies?
看起来都不像是男性化012---They're not even butch,
雄纠纠的饼干  有那种012---manly cookies with..
你知道的  大块咬的快感012---You know,with chunks!
你知道的  我不知道能说什么012---Well,you know,I don't know what to say.
我是说  我从没想过你是那种012---I mean,I never thought of you as a guy
需要"男人"是真正男人的男人012---who needed his men to be men.
我必须告诉你  罗斯012---I gotta tell you,Ross,
你也不像是脸上有烙印的猛男012---it's not like you just came in from branding cattle.
嘿  敏感跟太敏感是有区别的012---Hey,there's sensitive and there's too sensitive.
好吧  那什么叫做太敏感呢012---Okay,what is too sensitive?
不  我不能012---No,I can't.
我不能这样做  这样不好012---I can't do this. It's bad.
