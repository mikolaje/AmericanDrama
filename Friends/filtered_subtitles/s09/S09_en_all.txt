Joey?
Oh,my God.
Okay.
So..
I guess we should make it official,huh?
Look,Rach,I..
Hey,Ross is here!
Hey,look,it's my good friend Ross!
 Hey,Ross.  Hey,Joey.
 Hey,you.  Hey,you.
And he brought flowers!
Thanks,Ross.
I'm really more of a candy kind of guy.
You're weird today.
Listen,I wanted to talk to you about something.
Yeah. Actually,I kind of need to talk to you too.
 Joey,could you give us a minute?  No.
 What?  I'm sorry. I meant,"No."
Hi. Hey,look who's here.
Where's my granddaughter?
I've been practicing my magic tricks.
He pulled a quarter out of my ear.
 Hey,where's Mom?  She went to pick up Aunt Liddy.
Aunt Liddy's coming?
That means we get $5 each!
So when do I get to meet Emma
and show her this:
Okay,wow.
Emma's in the nursery.
I'll take you now if you want.
But I really want to talk to you.
I know. I still need to talk to you.
But before you guys do that,I need to talk to you.
And Ross,I need to talk to you.
 And I need to talk to you.  About what?
To see if you know what these guys are talking about.
Friends S09E01 The One Where No One Proposes
Isn't she beautiful?
Look at her,my first grandchild.
What about Ben?
Well,of course,Ben.
I meant my first granddaughter.
Have you thought any more about you and Rachel?
Yeah
actually I was gonna talk to her
when you guys came in the room.
That's so exciting!
You could've done that with us there.
 Yeah,right.  Sure. Okay.
You can touch yourself in front of us,
 but you can't talk to Rachel. What?
When have I ever touched myself in front of you guys?
Oh,please. Just before,when you were asleep in the lounge.
That Armenian family was watching you instead of the TV.
That reminds me.
That Mr. Hazmegian still has my Game Boy.
 Chandler,can I talk to you for a second?  Sure.
Dude,I just did something terrible.
That was you? I thought it was Jack.
No,no. That was Jack.
Rachel thinks I asked her to marry me.
What? Why does she think that?
Because it kind of looked like I did.
Again,what?
Okay,I was down on one knee
with the ring in my hand..
As we all are at some point during the day.
It wasn't my ring. It fell out of Ross' jacket..
and when I knelt down to pick it up,
Rachel thought I was proposing.
Ross had a ring? And he was gonna propose?
 I guess.  And you did it first?
This is gonna kill him.
You know how much he loves to propose.
I know. I know. It's awful.
Well,what did she say?
She said,"Yes."
Does Ross know?
Oh,my God. What the hell am I gonna tell him?
Maybe you don't have to tell him anything.
I like that. Yeah.
If you clear things up with Rachel,
Ross never needs to find out.
But you have to do it now
before he hears about it and kicks your ass.
All right,let's not get carried away.
I want a baby.
Honey,we've been over this.
I need to be facing the other way.
Come on, come on, If we have sex again,
it'll double our chances of getting pregnant.
 I think that closet's still available.  I am so tired.
 Yeah,okay,but no foreplay.  Deal!
Dad,seriously!
You know,you really should see someone about that.
Noted.
I wanna go talk to Rachel for a minute.
Are you gonna be okay alone for a bit?
Are you kidding me?
I could stay and look at her forever.
Actually..
Are you all right?
 I think I just got engaged.  Oh,my God! He did it?
What? Did you know he was gonna ask me?
Are you kidding? I'm,like,the one who talked him into it.
I like to think of myself as the puppet master of the group.
And you really think this is a good idea?
I just talked him into it.
Don't tell me I have to do you too?
 The puppet master gets tired,people.  Okay.
I don't know. It just doesn't feel right.
Why? You two are so meant to be together.
Everybody thinks so.
Really? Even Ross?
Especially Ross.
Hey,Phoebe. You know what? I'll come back later.
Kind of a full house here.
I guess I'll just.. I'll come back.
There he goes. Your fiance.
I guess so.
Although he does play with himself in his sleep.
I can't say I'm surprised.
Dad,what are you doing?
There are people in there having sex.
It can't be me. I'm standing right here.
 Wanna peek?  No!
Come on.
You know what? I don't like you without Mom.
Come on.
We're not peeking?
Well,I'm peeking.
Oh,my God!
Hello,sir. You know Monica.
 Hey,is it okay to come in?  Of course.
Joey,this ring, I..
It's beautiful. I love it.
Yeah. Look, Rach,
there's something I gotta tell you.
Are you ready to try nursing again?
Yeah. Hi,Emma.
Why do you think she won't take my breast?
It's all right. It takes babies a while to get it.
 But don't worry,it'll happen.  Okay.
Okay,sweetie,you can do it.
Just open up and put it in your mouth.
Dear Lord.
I'm sorry,honey,what were you saying?
Yeah,look,I think that..
Look! She's pulling away again.
Do you think my nipples are too big for her mouth?
She looks scared.
Doesn't she look scared?
You know,I don't really know her.
Why don't we try massaging the breast to stimulate the flow?
 Okay.  Are you kidding me?
This is so frustrating.
Why doesn't she want my breast?
I don't know! Maybe she's crazy!
 Hey,wait up.  Hi.
Congratulations.
I didn't want to say anything in front of Joey.
I didn't know if he knew.
What? That we had a baby?
Now let's give him a little credit.
Although he did eat a piece of plastic fruit earlier.
No,no,that you and Rachel are engaged.
 What?  Oh,it's a secret?
Goody. Yes! We haven't done the secret thing in a long time.
Phoebe,there is no secret,okay?
I didn't propose.
Are you lying?
Is this like that time
you tried to convince us you were a doctor?
I am a doctor!
You know what? I'm just gonna go and talk to Rachel myself.
All right. Well,me too.
Well,should we wake her up?
No. No. Come on,let her sleep.
 She's so exhausted.  And so engaged.
Oh,my God. She thinks we're engaged!
Why? Why,why would she think we're engaged?
Perhaps because you gave her an engagement ring?
You know,Ross,doctors are supposed to be smart.
 I didn't give her that ring.  You didn't?
 No!  So whose ring is it?
It's mine.
 Is it an engagement ring?  Yes.
 But you didn't give it to her?  No.
 But you were going to propose?  No!
I might be losing interest in this.
Look. Look,my mom gave me that ring..
because she wanted me to propose to Rachel.
But all I wanted to do was see..
if she maybe,kind of wanted to start things up again.
What beautiful lukewarm sentiment.
Look. I didn't want to rush into anything.
It seemed like she didn't want to either.
But I don't understand how any of this happened.
What,did she find the ring in my jacket,
assume I was gonna propose..
throw it on and just start telling people?
No,no. She said you actually proposed to her.
Well,I didn't! I didn't propose!
Unless..
Did I?
I haven't slept in 40 hours and..
It does sound like something I would do.
Look,we can't stay in here forever.
It's just,I still can't believe that my dad saw us having sex.
He didn't make it to one of my piano recitals,
but this he sees!
This is okay. We're all adults here.
There's nothing to be ashamed of.
Now,let's put our underwear in our pockets
and walk out the door.
Hi,Dad.
I can still call you that,right?
Of course. I'll always be your dad.
I just want you to know that
what you witnessed in there,that wasn't for fun.
 It wasn't fun?  Why,why,why would you..?
Look,I just don't want you to think..
that we're animals who do it whenever we want.
Well,I don't think that.
Before today,I never thought of you two having sex at all.
It was a simpler time.
The truth is,Dad,we're trying.
 What?  Yeah,we're trying to get pregnant.
Oh,my God,this is so exciting.
Well,get back in there! I'll guard the door!
That's okay,Dad,we can wait until later.
I don't think so. Aren't you ovulating?
Daddy!
You gotta get at it,princess.
When your mother and I were trying to conceive you..
whenever she was ovulating,bam,we did it!
That's how I got my bad hip.
That's funny. This conversation's
how I got the bullet hole in my head.
This one time I had my knee on the sink,
and your mother, she was..
I don't think we need to hear
the specific positions you and Mom had.
You're right. This is about your positions.
Now,what I saw in the closet
is not the optimum position..for conceiving a child.
Although it might feel good.
I don't feel good right now.
But pleasure is important,
and it helps if the woman has an orgasm.
You up to the task,sailor?
Oh,I need to tell you something.
Well,now's a good time.
I'm on my way to have my ears cut off.
Joey asked me to marry him.
 What?  Joey proposed to me.
Is he crazy? You just had Ross' baby!
Well,I said yes.
What,are you crazy?
You just had Ross' baby!
It's so inappropriate. No,it is worse than that.
It is wrong. It's...
It is bigger than mine!
I know.
Days of our Lives,thank you very much.
 You can't marry him.  Why not?
Come on,I don't want to do this alone,
and he's such a sweet guy.
And he loves me so much.
Well,do you love him?
Sure.
 Sure?  Yeah,I mean,whatever.
Honey,the question is..
do you really want to marry Joey?
No.
No,I don't.
Could you be a dear and go tell him?
You still haven't told Rachel you weren't proposing?
No. She had the ring on..
she seemed so excited,and then she took her breast out.
Joey,you have to tell her what's going on.
And what did it look like?
I didn't look at it.
The stupid baby's head was blocking most of it.
Go and tell Rachel right now,before Ross finds out.
Look,it's not that easy.
She said she wanted to marry me.
I don't want to hurt her.
Okay,look,just do it gently.
You're right. You're right.
I'll go tell her now before Ross finds out,
and I'll be gentle.
I can do that. I am a gentle person.
By the way,two people screwing in there
if you want to check that out.
Listen,I heard about the engagement.
Surprised?
And confused.
Rach,sweetie..
I didn't propose to you.
I know.
I don't think you do.
You didn't propose to me.
Joey did.
Poor baby,you're so tired.
Rach,I didn't propose to you.
Joey didn't propose to you.
And Chandler didn't propose to you.
You didn't propose to me.
Chandler didn't propose to me.
But Joey did.
Joey proposed to you?
 I can come back.  Wait. Wait. Wait.
 Joey,did you propose to her?  No.
 Yes,you did.  Actually,technically,I didn't.
 Well,then,why did you give me a ring?  Wait.
You gave her the ring?
No,and I did not ask her to marry me.
 Yes,you did.  No,I didn't.
 Yes,you did.  No,I didn't.
Yes,you did,and don't you say you didn't!
He was right there.
He got down on one knee and he proposed.
 You were down on one knee?  Yeah,that looks bad.
But  I didn't, I didn't propose.
Then what did happen?
Yeah,what did happen?
Okay,the ring fell on the floor,
and I went down to pick it up..
and you thought I was proposing.
Yeah,but you said,"Will you marry me?"
 No,I didn't.  Yes,you did.
No,I didn't.
Yes,you did. Oh,my God,you didn't.
Why didn't you tell me that before?
Well,I tried.. but people kept coming in,
and then you took your breast out.
You saw her breast?
I'll tell you about it later. Be cool.
Then Joey, what the hell were you doing with an engagement ring?
It wasn't my ring! It's Ross' ring.
That's why I felt so bad, Rach,
because he was gonna propose.
What?!
You were gonna propose to me?
No.
Well,this is awkward.
But I was going to see if,you know,
maybe you wanted to start dating again.
But that,I mean,that was all,Rach.
Dude,step up. I proposed.
No,you didn't.
That's right. There's a lot going on here,
and I think I ate some bad fruit earlier.
Hey,she just woke up. She's hungry.
Why don't we give this another try?
I can't believe you told her I was gonna propose.
I can't believe you're not gonna propose.
Hey,I am not gonna rush into anything.
Yeah,dude,I totally understand.
Usually after I have a baby with a woman,
I like to slow things down!
 Oh,my God!  What?
She's doing it! She's breastfeeding! Look.
It's beautiful.
 I'll come back for her later. OK
Thank you.
Wow,this feels weird.
What,good weird?
Wonderful weird.
You know what,you guys? I'm gonna go too.
And I'm sorry about everything.
Honey,don't worry,it was my mistake.
No,Rach,I should've told you sooner.
It's just that..
Man,that kid is going to town!
She's perfect.
We're so lucky.
We really are.
Look,I know it's not a proposal,
and I don't know where you are..
but with everything that's been going on and with Emma,I'm..
 I've been feeling..  Yeah,I know.
I've been feeling..
 Yeah?  Yeah.
Okay,well,that..
Wow,okay,well..
Then maybe at least we can talk about us again?
Yeah. Maybe.
Well,good. Okay.
I kind of think,you know,if we,if..
You're wearing the ring.
What's that?
And you told Phoebe you were engaged.
I'm sorry,what?
When you thought Joey proposed..
did you say yes?
Kids,I spoke to a doctor
and picked up these pamphlets on how to get pregnant.
 Hey,Dad.  Hi.
Sorry to bother you again,
but could you pass my pamphlets back?
Thank you.
You said you'd marry Joey?
Okay,you have to realize,I was exhausted,
I was emotional.
I would have said yes to anybody.
Like that time when you and I got married.
I'm not helping.
So you said yes to him,and you just had our baby?
That is right. And traditionally,
the daddy gives the mommy a present.
But I am prepared to let that go.
So when I came here to see
if you wanted to maybe start things up again..
you were engaged to my best friend?
Really?
I thought Chandler was your best friend.
Well,Chandler's my oldest friend.
Joey's my.. No!
Hey,I'm gonna take off. I just wanted to say goodbye.
Rachel said she'd marry you?
This isn't the right room. Sorry,folks.
Friends S09E02 The One Where Emma Cries
OK. I don't want to be negative.
So I'll say most of the signs you bought are good.
No,they ran out of "It's a Girl!"
But I can fix this one.
See? Huh?
So sexy.
 Honey?  Yeah?
Honey,why don't you lie down?
No, no, no. It's okay.
Ross and Rachel will be back soon,
and then I gotta go to the office.
Am I producing them?
Why are you so tired?
I couldn't sleep last night.
I started worrying about
this big divisional meeting I have later today.
The more I worried,the more I couldn't sleep.
You know,and then I was,like,
"If I fall asleep now,I'll get six hours' sleep.
But if I fall asleep now,
I'll get five hours' sleep."
No matter what I did,I couldn't fall asleep.
You know what you should've done?
Told yourself that little story.
 Welcome home.  Hi.
Phoebe did the signs.
You guys,thanks for doing this.
Look at all that stuff people sent.
Oh,my gosh. Look,there's something every mother needs.
A giant,stuffed gorilla that takes up the entire apartment.
What are people think..?
You guys,I love it.
Hey,so where's Ross?
He's downstairs getting the stuff out of the cab.
Is he still mad at us?
Well,you more than me.
But he can't stay too mad at me.
I mean,I just had his baby.
That's not fair. I can't do that.
I'm not sure you should be here when he comes up.
Say that's what I was afraid of.
I didn't think I should be here either.
But somebody said he'd be over it.
Hey,what do I know?
I wanted to get a bigger gorilla.
The numbers we're seeing in Chicago,
New York and London are solid.
But many of our field offices have reported disappointing yields.
Boston is down. Atlanta is down. Houston is down.
I could go on and on.
But instead of boring you..
I'll go straight to my 42point plan.
Walter.
She's just so cute.
I just want to bite her ear off and use it as a sucking candy.
Phoebe.
But I could take one of those little feet
and put it in a pita pocket.
Okay. I put most of the stuff away.
Oh,great. The pacifiers?
It's in the cupboard.
 The burping cloths?  Linen closet.
The diapers?
In the hospital.
Wow,you guys got a hospital? Fancy.
No,I left the diapers at the hospital.
There's some in the bag,
but I'll run out and get some more.
All right,thanks.
Could you stop at the coffeehouse and get me a muffin?
 Sure. What kind?  Let me think.
What do I want?
What do I want?
Please,take your time.
It's an important decision,not like..
say,I don't know,deciding to marry someone.
This is about a muffin.
 Blueberry.  Blueberry it is.
Thank you.
Wow,he's not letting this go,is he?
God,how long do you think that's gonna last?
I don't know.
He got over the "We were on a break" thing
really quickly.
You know what,I can't worry about it right now.
Because I've got the cutie little baby.
I can't believe how much I love her.
I mean,I can't get enough of her.
Like,right now? I miss her. I actually miss her.
You know,that's her?
God,look at her sleeping. I love her so much.
 I think I'm gonna wake her up.  Rach,no.
You know,you're never supposed to wake a sleeping baby.
Well,I can do whatever I want. I made her.
Come on,little girl. Yes. Hello,Emma. Hello.
Well,I would say I told you so,
but she's kind of doing that for me.
I'm sorry. Mommy's so sorry. Go back to sleep.
Go back to sleep.
 It breaks your heart,doesn't it?  It really does.
How long do you think we have to stay?
Okay,if everyone's onboard,it's settled.
Chandler?
 Chandler?  Yeah.
Are you onboard?
Yes.
Well,then problem solved.
Chandler will run our office in Tulsa.
You're gonna love Oklahoma.
All right. We already tried feeding her,
changing her,burping her..
Try this one.
"Go back in time and listen to Phoebe."
 All right,here's something.  What?
It says to try holding the baby close to your body..
and then swing her rapidly from side to side.
Okay.
It worked!
No. Just stopped to throw up a little bit.
Mon,what am I gonna do?
It's been hours,and it won't stop crying.
She,Rach. Not it. She.
Yeah. I'm not so sure.
Oh,my God,I'm losing my mind.
Yeah,no kidding.
All right,this just proves
no good can come from having sex with Ross!
Hey,Gunther. Can I get a couple of blueberry muffins to go?
 Diapers,huh?  Yep.
So I guess Rachel had your baby?
 Yep. Can you believe it?  Nope.
I can't even believe she slept with you in the first place.
You mean,like..
Ross, I know you're pissed at me,
but we have to talk about this.
Actually,we don't.
Fine. Okay. But I gotta say,
technically,I didn't even do anything wrong.
What? You didn't do anything wrong?
 I said I didn't technically.  Okay.
Let's put aside the fact that you "accidentally"..
picked up my grandmother's ring
and you "accidentally" proposed to Rachel.
Can I just stop you there for a second?
When people do this:
I don't really know what that means.
You were saying?
And I could even understand that you couldn't tell Rachel.
But why couldn't you tell me?
You had all day to,and you didn't.
I know. I should've. "I'm sorry."
Not using it right,Joe.
"I'm sorry."
 I'm gonna go.  No,come on.
Look, Ross,we have to get past this.
Give me the bag.
No,I don't know what else to do.
 I said I'm sorry,now.. Joey
Now you should scream at me or curse me or hit me.
I'm not gonna hit you.
Why not?
You'll feel better. I'll feel better.
You know you want to,
I can see it in your eyes.
 I don't.  A little bit.
 No.  Little bit.
 No.  A little bit more.
 Give me the bag.  No. Hit me.
 Give me the bag.  Hit me.
 Joey, Give me the bag. .  Hit me.
 Joey, I'm not kidding.  Hit me.
 No.  Hit me. Hit me. Hit me!
You ducked!
I'm sorry! It was a reflex!
Oh,my God! This really hurts!
I couldn't help it.
When a fist comes at your face,you duck. Look.
What is the matter with you?
You were supposed to duck!
Why didn't you?
Let's talk on the way to the hospital.
Good. Yeah,maybe while we're there,
they can check your reflexes.
 Try feeding her again.  I already fed her.
I know. That's why I said,"Again!"
You guys,we can't turn on each other,okay?
That's just what she wants.
Can I talk to you outside?
Oh, no, you guys just stay here.
I'm gonna check her diaper.
Phoebe,you want to come?
I'm kind of part of this.
Actually,Phoebs,
it's a husbandandwife kind of thing.
I knew I should've married Chandler.
 Okay,what's up?  Okay.
You know we said
it would be fun to move to Paris for a year?
And you could study French cooking,and I could write..
and we could picnic along the Seine,
and go winetasting in Bordeaux.
 Yeah.  Okay.
You know how people say that Tulsa.
is the Paris of Oklahoma?
What? Who says that?
People who have never been to Paris?
Well,what's going on?
We're moving to Tulsa.
 Excuse me?  Okay.
Ms. McKenna,she kind of works above my boss.
She asked me to move to Tulsa
and be president of our office there.
And I was sleeping and apparently said yes.
Tulsa,Oklahoma?
The Sooner State.
Whatever that is.
Chandler,
I don't even want to see the musical Oklahoma.
Really? "Oh,What a Beautiful Morning,"
"Surrey With the Fringe on Top"?
Are you trying to tell me we're moving to Oklahoma
or that you're gay?
All right,not that this matters,
but did they at least offer you a huge raise?
No. But they are going to lease us a Ford Focus.
 I'll get out of it.  Thank you.
 What is wrong with Emma?  She misunderstood.
She thought she was moving to Tulsa.
Ma'am,do you have a minute?
I kind of have some bad news.
I don't think I can move to Tulsa.
 What?  It's a funny story,actually.
I kind of fell asleep in the meeting this morning.
So when I said I'd move to Tulsa,
I didn't really know what I was saying.
You fell asleep?
But only because I was up all night
worried about this meeting.
Isn't that funny?
Irony. Not a fan? All right.
See,here's the thing.
I went home and told my wife about Tulsa,
and she won't go.
See me,I love Tulsa.
Tulsa is heaven. Tulsa is ltaly.
Please don't make me go there.
 Chandler,I..  I know that you're upset..
No,look,Carol. Can I call you Carol?
Why would I when your name is Elaine?
What a great picture of your son. Strapping.
That's a picture of your daughter,isn't it?
Well,she's lovely.
I like a girl with a strong jaw.
I'll call you from Tulsa.
Hey. So how is it?
 I broke my thumb.  Your thumb?
That's weird.
Are you sure you're punching right?
Make a fist.
Maybe later.
Ross,I feel terrible.
You know what,you can go.
I just have to fill out some forms.
You want me to help you with that?
Why,does it look like
I'm having trouble with my misshapen claw?
Name?
No,I know Ross.
But what's it short for?
You know,like Rossell.
Or Rosstrophor.
Just Ross.
It's pretty.
 Okay,date of birth?  You know my birthday.
Sure.
May.. tember?
 October 18.  Occupation? Dinosaurs.
Actually,I'm a paleon.. Dinosaurs is fine.
The drawing is not.
All right,who do you want as your emergency contact?
 Rachel,I guess.  Okay. Relationship?
Boy,this could take a while.
 Just put roommate.  Come on.
You guys are more than that.
You're gonna get together,right?
I don't think that we are.
But you two are supposed to be together.
Well,I thought so too.
But then she said she'd marry you.
Come on,Ross,that didn't mean anything.
She'd just had the baby.
She was freaked out about doing it alone.
She would have said yes to anybody.
Yeah,that's what she said.
So?
So I don't want to be just anybody.
You know what? It's better this way anyway.
I don't know what I was thinking,
going down that road again with us.
It's just much easier if we're just friends
who have a kid.
 Really?  Yeah.
And you're okay with that?
Yes. That's what we always planned.
And if you have a plan,you should stick to it.
That's why they call them plans. Hello?
I'm fine.
Hey,for what it's worth.. with Rachel,
I don't think you'll ever be just "anybody."
Hey,there you go.
"Thanks."
Oh,my God. How long has she been crying?
About a week and a half.
Well,it looks like you guys got it under control,
so I'm just gonna go.
No? Really?
Misery really does love company?
All right.
Try holding her a different way.
You guys, I'm doing the best I can.
Anyone else is welcome to try.
All right,I'll try. Fine.
 Yes. Okay. Okay.  Here you go.
Hey. Oh,gosh.
Nothing works with this child!
God,what am I gonna do,you guys?
I can't even comfort my own baby.
I'm the worst mother ever.
No,you're just new at this.
You'll get better.
Think about your first day at work.
That couldn't have been easy,
but you figured that out.
Yeah,I don't think dressing provocatively
is going to help me here!
God,just please take her.
Okay,I'll take her. Come on.
Oh,boy,I have to go to the bathroom.
I have to go scream into a pillow.
Bouncy. Bouncy baby. Bouncy baby.
Oh,baby,baby. Oh,baby,baby.
Oh,baby,baby,baby.
Have I gone deaf?
It worked.
Oh,baby,baby,baby.
Oh,baby,baby,baby.
You must be a fireball in bed!
I can't believe it. She's asleep.
I got her to go to sleep.
I have actual magical powers.
I can hear traffic and birds.
I can hear the voices in my head again.
I'm kidding.
Oh,my God! You got her to stop crying!
Yes,I did.
I'm Monica,super aunt.
You are the official babycrier stopper.
Yes,I am.
 You're never leaving the apartment.  Say what?
That's your new job,day or night.
She starts crying,I need you here.
No,no,no.
Thankfully,you don't need me at all.
So okay. Hey,super aunt? See you later.
Rachel? Let's give it six to eight months.
Okay,so listen,I'm gonna go lay down.
What?
The book says whenever she's sleeping,I should be sleeping.
So..
Thank you.
We just got her to go to sleep.
So there can't be any yelling?
No.
 We're moving to Tulsa.  What?
I can't.. I can't hear.
 Hey.  Hey. Where have you been?
What happened to you?
I had a little thing with Joey.
If you think this is bad,you should see him.
No,Ross,this is not good.
We have to talk about this Joey thing. Please sit.
All right,you have got to get over this Joey thing.
Okay?
I never really wanted to marry Joey,okay?
Okay.
You know what I really,really want?
What,Rach?
I wanna sleep.
I wanna eat. I wanna take a shower.
I mean,before she wakes up,
and we gotta do this all over again.
 Right.  I mean,because I got news for you.
Emma: not easy.
Well,that's what I'm here for.
 You want me to get that?  No,that's really okay.
 Monica?  Got it,got it,got it,got it.
I've been thinking about this.
And I gotta tell you,it's not my fault.
It's a natural instinct.
What are you talking about?
Great. Okay,what would you do if I did this?
So,what's the big news
we rushed all the way over here for?
Our news. My company has asked me
to head up our office in Tulsa.
So as of Monday,
I'm being officially relocated.
 Oh,my God!  What? Monday?
How long do you have to go for?
They said it could be up to a year.
 A year?  Well,do you have to go?
Well,I kind of have to,don't I?
Because of this stupid thing.
There's nothing like the support of your loving wife,huh?
Wait a minute. Wait,you can't go to Tulsa.
Maybe you forgot,
but we have tickets to the Jets game next week!
I'm sorry,
but I don't think I'll be able to make it.
But we were gonna go see the Jets!
You can't go.
I mean,you're the glue that holds this group together.
 Really?  Not you.
I can't believe you guys are moving.
 I call their apartment!  No!
Friends S09E03 The One With The Pediatrician
 Here you go,Rach.  Thank you,Joey.
You know what? I'm not even sure
I can have caffeine.
I went through this with Ben and Carol.
One cup of coffee won't affect your milk.
Just to be sure,I'm gonna call Dr. Wiener. 
Every time?
Rach, You don't have to
call him whenever you have a question,okay?
Trust me. I know this.
All right. I trust you.
I can see you dialing. I don't understand why..
I'm on the phone! Dr. Wiener?
It's so weird seeing Ross and Rachel with a baby.
It's just so grownup.
I know,yeah.
I feel like we're all growing up.
A person named "Wiener." God,that kills me
Look at you all grownup.
Well,actually,you know what?
I am,you know?
Well,that whole thing with Rachel made me realize..
that maybe I'm ready
for a more serious relationship,you know?
Like,I'd like to meet a
nice,mature,commitmentminded lady.
And looks aren't as important as..
Nah,she's gotta be hot.
You know,I might know somebody.
How about you set me up with someone,
and we doubledate?
I can do that. Yeah. How's Friday?
 Done!  All right.
Good,really? Okay,let's see.
All right.
You know who's great? Sandy Poopack.
"Poopack"?
Yeah. All right.
Well,that rules out Lana Titwyler.
 I've got good news.  You got out of the whole Tulsa thing?
Okay,I have news.
You don't have to move to Tulsa.
You can stay here and keep your job.
That's great! How?
My boss and I worked out a deal
where I'm in Tulsa four days a week.
So the other three,I can be here with you.
So you're gonna be gone four days a week?
No.
I'm sorry,are you just used to saying that?
No. I can't be away from you for that long.
 Really?  Yeah,you're my husband.
I can not live
in a different state than you for 208 days out of the year.
That's fast math.
We could use you in Tulsa.
Thanks for trying to figure out a way,
but if you go to Tulsa,I go with you.
You said that without gagging.
I know!
Well,excuse me?
Oh,yeah? Well,up yours too!
 Who the hell was that?  Dr. Wiener.
Rach,you can't call people at 3:00 in the morning.
You know what? You sound just like his wife.
Was there anything even wrong with Emma?
Yes,of course there is! Okay? I'm not insane.
What was it?
Hiccups.
Rachel, I told you,
you can't call him every time any little thing comes up.
Well,not anymore I can't.
He fired us!
We have to find a pediatrician.
Wait,Monica said that when you guys were growing up..
you liked your doctor.
What was his name?
Dr. Gettleman?
Yeah,no,I don't think that's a good idea.
In fact,I think he's dead.
Why does everything happen to me?
Rach, I promise,first thing tomorrow,
we'll find another doctor.
But I gotta get up early,
and I'm not feeling well.
What? Where? You're not feeling well?
What do you have? Rubella?
Because don't go near Emma,she has not had that shot.
You know,come to think of it,it does feel rubellalike.
Wiener!
Wiener! Wiener! Wiener!
Rachel!
Great! Now he's gonna know it was me!
So how is this for our big double date tonight?
Oh,my God.
Great. Just the reaction I was hoping for.
Yeah,so you found someone for me?
You didn't forget?
Of course not. And you'll love Mary Ellen.
She's really smart and cute and funny and..
I can't tell you how I know this,
but she is not opposed to threesomes.
All right.
 So tell me something about my guy.  No.
Come on,give me something. What's his name?
Mike.
Mike. Okay,what's his last name?
Damn it! Is there no mystery left in romance anymore?!
All right.
We'll see you and Mike at the restaurant in a couple hours.
All right,great. See you. Byebye.
Why'd I have to say Mike?
I don't know a Mike!
Why couldn't I have said..?
There's no guys in there!
It's impossible to find a good doctor.
How do you know the good ones..
from the ones who'll push their penis against your knee?
Excuse me?
I know what she's talking about.
Well,we've gotta find a new pediatrician.
Ross was getting sick last night,
and Emma may have caught it.
Why don't you see Dr. Gettleman?
Ross said he died.
He didn't die.
I just saw his daughter last week.
She said he was fine.
Her,on the other hand,botched Botox.
Great. Well then,I'm gonna take Emma to see him.
I wonder why Ross said that he died?
Maybe he was getting him confused
with his childhood therapist.
He saw a therapist?
He used to have a recurring nightmare.
It freaked him out.
Wow,what was it?
That I was going to eat him.
Mike!
Yeah?
Okay.
I can't believe I'm doing this with you.
Although I did just end a nineyear relationship..
so I should be open to taking some risks.
Everything is gonna be fine, ok?
Follow my lead.
All you have to do is pretend to be Mike.
 I am Mike.  Attaboy.
Here they come.
I'm Phoebe.
Hi. Phoebe. Mike.
Nice to meet you.
Joey,this is Mary Ellen Jenkins.
So,Mike,how do you and Joey know each other,anyway?
How do Joey and I know each other?
If I had a nickel for every time
somebody's asked me that.
 From school.  We met in college.
I mean high school.
You guys go way back,then.
So,what are you up to these days?
 Well,I'm a lawyer.  Mike,attorney at law!
 Actually,I just gave up my practice.  What?
That's the kind of thing you usually run by me.
I always want to play piano professionally.
If I don't do this now,I never will.
Great. I like that better than the lawyer thing.
Which is why I waited until now
to introduce you to Mike.
You thought he was still a lawyer.
No,that's not what I meant.
Let's get you a cocktail.
What are you doing?
Looking for restaurant jobs for you in Tulsa.
That's so sweet. Did you find anything?
 Slim Pickins.  Nothing,huh?
No. Slim Pickins. It's a barbecue joint.
They're looking for a cook.
Actually,"cook" may be a bit of a stretch.
They're looking for somebody to shovel mesquite.
"Slim Pickins"? That is so cheesy.
Well,So Cheesy also has an opening.
Honey,that's okay.
I know this woman,Nancy..
who's a restaurant biz headhunter.
She may know something.
Can I say how much I appreciate you coming with me?
When we get to Tulsa,
I am taking you for a great dinner at Slim Pickins.
So Cheesy?
Whole Hog?
It's gonna be tough to keep kosher in Tulsa.
Hi,Nancy?
Hi,it's Monica Geller.
I'm good. Listen,I'm looking for a job in Tulsa.
Yeah,well,my husband's been relocated.
Because I love him.
No,I don't want a job in New York.
Javu's looking? Oh,my God!
He asked for me personally? Oh,my God!
Wow,this is really,really flattering.
But I'm moving to Tulsa.
So,just,if you would tell Javu..
I'll take it!
My name's Rachel Greene.
I have an appointment for Emma.
Dr. Gettleman is finishing up with a patient.
 He'll be out shortly. OK, thank you.
I think you just have a cold.
It's definitely not strep.
Thanks,doctor.
Would you like a lollipop?
Do you even have to ask?
He is alive!
It's so surprising that
you and Joey have known each other for so long..
and I've never heard about you.
That's because we had a bit of a falling out.
Mike hit my mom with a car.
No,I didn't.
That's okay. I have forgiven you.
Now we're friends again,and everything's great.
Well,wait. Is your mom okay?
Please,we're trying to have a conversation.
You're a lot nicer on Days of Our Lives.
Days of Our Lives!
That's why you look so familiar!
 What?  What?
What?
Do you not know each other?
Of course we do.
He's playing a game we used to play in high school.
We pretend we don't know each other.
We played all kinds of games.
You remember that one
where I punch you in the face for not being cool?
Let me ask you something:
How many sisters does Joey have?
 Six.  No,he doesn't. He has seven.
What are you doing? I said seven!
Joey,why did you set me up with a stranger?
Because I forgot about our date.
I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry too.
And just to be clear,I didn't hit his mother with a car.
You are unbelievable.
I spent so much time finding
the perfect girl for you, you know?
Mary Ellen is really smart and cute and loose.
Hey
Who are you kidding?
You find some guy off the street for me?
God,this is humiliating!
Phoebe, I'm so sorry.
If you don't like this guy,
I can find you a better one.
Mike? Mike?
I'm out of here.
It was nice meeting you.
You're leaving too?
I'll stay if you can tell me my name.
Have a good night.
Honey, we are leaving tomorrow,
and you still have a lot of packing to do.
You're right.
Maybe I shouldn't go.
What?
So Nancy told me about
this job at this great restaurant,Javu?
But it's just a little outside of Tulsa.
Well,how far outside?
Manhattan?
And you're thinking of taking it?
So, before,you said that being with me
was more important than any job.
But I guess now it's
old job,me,new job.
I'm gonna miss this hand!
I know this is a lot to ask..
but,my God, Chandler,
this is a onceinalifetime opportunity.
What happened to "you can't live without me
four days a week"?
Well,if you really think about it,
I mean,four days is not that long.
I mean, I see you Monday before you go to work..
and Thursday when you get back..
and I always work late on Tuesdays,
so really if you think about it..
it's really just one day.
And well,if we can't make it one day,
we got real problems,my friend.
I think you should take the job.
Really?
Yeah. I know it must be important to you
when you start chattering like a monkey.
That's the nicest thing anybody's ever said to me.
How was the pediatrician?
I really liked him.
Yeah,yeah. It was really,really,
really good.
 You promised not to say anything.  I know.
Ross still sees his pediatrician!
I don't care.
Are you serious? You still see Dr. Gettleman?
He is a brilliant diagnostician!
Diagnostician or booboo fixer?
Ross, Seriously,
you gotta go to an appropriate doctor.
Why? Why? I know it's a little weird,
but he is a great doctor,okay?
He knows my medical history.
And every time I go in there,
he makes a big deal.
You know,"Look,it's my favorite patient."
Does he say that before
he sticks his thermometer in your tushy?
I seem to remember someone
bringing his security blanket to college.
That was not a security blanket. That was a wall hanging.
It didn't spend much time on the wall!
Excuse me.
Hi. I was hoping to run into you.
Can we talk?
Sure.
Look,I'm sorry,really. I'm so embarrassed.
Please.
Really,I'm a pretty nice guy.
Just ask my parole officer.
Apparently,I'm not a funny guy.
Well,why did you go along with that?
Because I was told that
I'd get a free dinner,
which I didn't.
And that I'd meet a pretty girl,
which I did.
That's true.
Well,is anything you told me about yourself true?
My name is Mike.
And I do play piano.
Prove it.
There isn't a piano here.
That wouldn't stand in the way of a true pianist.
Okay.
You are really good.
I play a little guitar myself.
Really? That's great.
What kind of music do you play?
Like acoustic,folksy stuff,you know?
But right now I'm working on
a couple lron Maiden covers.
Do you think that,maybe,sometime,I could..
It's okay. Go ahead,ask me out.
Okay. You think,maybe,sometime
I could take you out?
You just caught me off guard.
Yeah,that would be nice.
Look at this! My two best friends!
Excuse me. I don't mean to be a jerk..
but the baby with the rash
came in after me.
The doctor will be right with you,sir.
Mommy,I can't find Waldo.
What,the circus? He's behind the elephant.
Wow. So your child's a big fan of the Waldo books too?
Yeah,that's how I know.
 I'm Ross,by the way.  Hi,I'm Sally.
So no ring.
Can I assume you're also a single parent?
I am a single parent.
It's hard,isn't it?
There's no time for a social life.
Where are you gonna meet someone?
Let's say,I don't know,
you met someone in the pediatrician's office.
Rossie? We're ready for you.
Yeah..
Come on,Ross Jr. It's time to go in.
Mommy.
Mommy,what's wrong with that man?
Hey,I helped you find Waldo!
 Good,you haven't left yet.  Where have you been?
I got held up at Dr. Gettleman's office.
There was some guy that freaked everybody out.
You got here just in time.
I really have to go,buddy.
Oh,man.
Honey. Promise to call me when you land?
Of course I will call you. I love you.
I love you too.
Watch the tongue,people. We got a baby over here.
 Bye,Chandler.  Bye.
 Bye,honey.  Bye.
 What's the matter,Joe?  I'm mad at you for leaving.
You know,you're nothing but a big leaver.
A big leaver with a stupid suitcase.
Any chance you're trying to pick a fight
to make all of this easier?
Dude,you see right through me!
Okay,well.. Bye,Mon.
Bye,Ross. Rachel.
 Bye,Emma.  Okay,byebye.
Have a good trip. Okay. Oh,my God.
Chandler, Wait.
It goes old job..
new job..
and you.
This is just something I have to do.
I know.
I love you so much.
I know that too.
Don't worry. I'll be back before you know it.
Yes,it will be the same.
Because I know,that's how.
I promise.
You double promise?
Call me when you land.
 Can I talk now?  Okay,bye.
 Joey!  He had to board.
Hey,Ross.
I'm so glad someone's here.
Could you zip me up?
 Sure.  Thank you.
Can you believe no one between my apartment and here..
offered to do that for me?
People.
So why are you so dressed up?
Mike's picking me up for a date.
How's that going? Is it getting serious?
I don't know. I don't know.
I mean,I like him.
But am I ready
to take my Grade A loins off the meat market?
I'm not quite sure.
You know,I really admire your whole dating attitude.
It's so healthy.
I'm always like,"Is this moving too fast?
Is this moving too slow? Where's this going?"
I know. You are a bit of a drama queen.
You're so much better off.
You just go from guy to guy having fun..
and not worrying that it never turns into anything serious.
I wouldn't say "never."
You know,there is that guy.
Okay,well,what about..?
Okay,there's gotta be someone.
There isn't! That's what I'm saying.
Oh,my God,you're right!
I know. And yet,here you are,
all ready for the next date.
I can't believe I never realized this before.
I'm in my 30s,
and I've never been in a longterm relationship.
Oh,my God,what's wrong with me?
No, no, no.
There's nothing wrong with you.
I mean,you don't strike me as
the type of person that wants to get married.
I want to get married!
No,please.. Please don't cry because of me.
I don't know what I'm talking about,okay?
I've been divorced three times.
At least you've been married.
Oh,my God! I want to trade lives with Ross?!
Phoebe.
What's wrong?
Nothing. I'm excited about our date.
Mike,this is Ross Geller.
Ross,this is Mike..
Sorry,I didn't catch that.
Mike Hanigan.
 Ross Geller.  Hey.
So are you sure you're ready to go?
How do I look?
 Do you have a compact in your purse?  No.
You look great.
Friends S09E04 The One With The Sharks
Hey,Joey.
This girl won't turn around.
I can't tell if she's hot or not. What do you think?
Joey,I am not going to objectify women with you.
But if her face is as nice as her ass..
 Mama!  All right. Thanks.
Have you talked to Chandler?
He has to stay in Tulsa this weekend.
 How come?  I don't know. He has to work.
There's some big rush on the..
Damn it. One of these days I'm gonna have to start
listening when he talks about his job.
Why don't you fly out there and surprise him?
Maybe I will go.
We'll have a little second honeymoon
at the Tulsa Ramada.
You should bring your black seethrough teddy
with the attached garters.
How do you know I have one of those?
Didn't until just now.
Hot. Not hot.
Hot!
Excuse me?
I said that I think you're hot.
And.. now I'm embarrassed.
I thought you said "hi."
That would've been better.
I'll try that. Hi,I'm Joey.
I'm Hayley.
Look,I don't normally ask out
women that I meet in coffeehouses.
Gesundheit.
 Anyway..  I would love to go out with you.
Really? Great.
Did I..? Did I actually ask you?
That's just where you were going.
I figured I'd help you out.
You don't seem like the kind of guy who does this a lot?
 So how'd the date go?  Well,it was awful.
Every time I thought about what you said,I cried.
So he hasn't called?
Would you call this girl:
"Thanks for.. a lovely.. evening"?
Now I feel terrible. This is all my fault.
You know what you should feel terrible about?
This could have been my serious guy.
He was sweet and smart and funny.
You know how hard it is to meet a guy like that?
We are a rare breed.
What a great dinner.
Thanks again for letting me
have that last piece of cake at the restaurant.
You're welcome again. I'm gonna go make some coffee.
 Can I get you anything?  Do you have any cake?
So this is going pretty good.
Dinner was nice. We've got a lot in common.
Victoria 's Secret.
We even like the same books.
There's a scary painting.
Wait a minute.
I think I've been scared by that painting before.
You know what? This whole place looks familiar.
I have definitely been in this apartment.
I know I've seen this weird plant before.
It did that the last time!
Oh,my God. I've gone out with this girl before.
Yeah! We had sex on this couch!
And then on that chair,and.. No.
No,we didn't do it here..
which is weird,because it seems like a perfectly good place.
That's why.
Hey,Mike.
Sorry to just drop by like this. Can I come in?
Sure.
Who are you?
I'm Ross. Phoebe's friend from the coffeehouse?
I really,really need to talk to you about something.
Unless..
You're not gonna try and get me to join a cult,are you?
 No.  No,it's just,
you have that look.
Damn Supercuts!
Well,what's up? Is Phoebe okay?
Oh,yeah,yeah.
Phoebe is great. But..
I'm an idiot,okay?
Right before you guys went out..
I accidentally got her all upset.
That's why she was weird.
Yes. Yeah,I..
Yeah,I said something stupid
about her never having had a serious relationship.
But you should know,
she is so much fun. A wonderful person.
Please,don't blow her off.
I'm not gonna blow her off.
I just got off the phone with her.
We're going out tomorrow night.
I mean,I hope that's okay with you,
stranger from the coffeehouse.
Well,then,I didn't need to bother you.
You
or the four other Mike Hanigans I bothered.
Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait.
Is that true what you said?
Phoebe's never had a serious relationship?
Of course she has.
If she's never had a serious relationship..
do you think I'd go around broadcasting it..
like some kind of unstoppable moron?
But you did say it.
Yes. Yes,I did.
And I will also say..
what I'm about to say..
visavis..
the following.
Phoebe has never had a serious relationship..
since..
her superserious relationship..
with.. Vikram.
 Vikram?  What? That's a real name.
Stop it!
Why couldn't they have sent me to Texas?
Seven o'clock.
Maybe I'll hit the gym.
Who am I kidding? Payperview porn.
 Do not disturb! Do not disturb!  Surprise!
 Monica?  Is everything all right?
Yeah,everything's great. I was just..
watching some regular television there.
What a pleasant surprise.
I'm gonna go freshen up,okay?
Okay,honey.
That was close.
 Hello.  Hey,Rach,it's me.
Okay,I just got to Chandler's room,
and I caught him..
molesting himself.
That couldn't have been pretty.
But you know,guys do that.
Yeah? Well,the weird part is..
he was getting off.. to a sharkattack show!
 No!  Yes!
Chandler watches shark porn!
 While watching sharks?  Yeah.
Are you sure that's what he was doing?
You know how many times I've seen him
jump up like that?
Believe me,I know what he was doing.
Man! Sharks!
I always knew there was something weird about that dude.
You promised to love him no matter what.
"What" means,like,if he gets a disease
or kills someone.
Not if he gets his jollies to Jaws.
You know what,honey? Guys are just different.
They like things that we can't understand.
I once dated this guy
who wanted to pretend..
that he was an archeologist,and I was this..
naughty cavewoman
who he unfroze from a block of ice.
Are you talking about my brother?
I didn't disguise that very well,did I?
I went out with this girl last night.
Halfway through our date I realized..
I already slept with her.
You've slept with all the women in N.Y.,
and now you're going around again?
That's not even the weird part.
She didn't remember sleeping with me!
You don't remember sleeping with her.
But she should remember sleeping with me.
I am very memorable!
 You guys know.  How do we know?
We've never slept with you.
And whose fault is that?
What's the big deal?
You forgot,she forgot.
 Maybe you were having an off night.  Hey!
I never have an off night. Okay?
Although,sometimes if I'm a little bloated,
I don't feel that sexy.
But even then,I'm better than most!
Honey,why don't you just let it go
and ask her out again?
You're both so slutty,
you don't remember who you slept with.
You're made for each other.
Interesting.
Well,I'll go out with her again
and I'll try to get past it.
No salt! Bloaty!
 Joey?  What?
You don't think sharks are sexy,do you?
No.
Wait a minute. Wait,what was the Little Mermaid?
It's open!
Mike called! We're going out again!
Quick thing. I went to talk to Mike.
What?
What did you..? What did you do,Ross?
Oh,boy. You got mad at that part.
I went over there,you know,to tell him how..
How great you are. But..
Well,you know me. Blahblahblah.
 And I ended up telling him that..  What?
You had a sixyearlong relationship..
with a guy named Vikram.
What? Why?
Well,he seemed..
to bum hard when I told him that
you'd never been in a serious relationship.
If you hadn't just
had a baby with my best friend..
I swear to Lucifer..
a rabid dog would be feasting on your danglers right now!
I think you'll feel differently when you know..
a little bit about Vikram.
Okay,he's a..
He's a kite designer.
And he used to date Oprah.
I'm not going along with some lie you made up,Ross.
 I'm just gonna be honest with him.  Good.
Just be honest with him.
 I have nothing to be ashamed of.  No.
Ok, So I haven't been in a relationship
that lasted longer than a month.
Okay? I haven't had a real boyfriend.
You know? If he can't handle it,then he can leave.
Which he will.
And,you know,that's okay.
So I'll just be alone forever.
You know,all right. It'll be fine. It'll be fine.
I'll go on walking tours with widows and lesbians.
 I'll get it.  Okay.
I'm trying to remember the last time I opened a door
and you weren't there.
Phoebe,are you okay?
Yeah. There's just..
There's something you should know.
Vikram just called.
So it was really a shock after 25 years of marriage..
my parents of perfect couple are getting divorced.
I kind took it the hardest..
 because I was the youngest.  Sure. Yeah.
How can you not remember me?
What?
How could you not remember that we slept together?
 What? When?  I don't know!
I really,really think
I would remember sleeping with you.
Come on,come on.
Search your brain,all right? It was..
a certain amount of time ago.
Ok, I was here. You were here.
We had sex here,here,here..
Not there.
 Anything?  No,it's not ringing any bells.
My God,woman!
How many people have you been with
not to remember this?
Hey,Hayley. We really gotta fix that doorknob.
Joey?
I slept with you!
And you obviously remember me!
Hey,I still got it!
So we're good.
I'll let myself out.
And I said,"Okay,Vikram..
you can't just call every time you get lonely. You know.
You gave up that right
when you slept with Rachel."
Rachel? I thought she just had a baby with Ross.
Yeah,well..
Yeah.
But Emma's birth certificate
might say "Geller"..
but her eyes say "Mukherjee."
That is so wrong. And on top of that,he's a glue sniffer?
I know. But he calls,
and my heart goes to him.
You know,that bastard
is one smoothtalking freelance kite designer.
I think there's somebody better out there for you.
I mean,you know,I'm..
I'm not saying me,but..
Maybe.. me.
And you don't have to worry about gluesniffing with me.
Although,I do smell the occasional Magic Marker.
Yeah. Anyway,I just..
I think I can make you happy.
 Okay,I can't do this.  What's wrong?
Well,there is no Vikram. Ross made him up.
Because I..
I really never have been in a longterm relationship.
I've never lived with a guy.
I've never even celebrated an anniversary.
So..
If that's too weird for you..
and you want to leave,I totally understand.
In fact,I'll close my eyes
to make it less awkward.
You kissed me.
You don't think I'm a total freak?
No.
Look,can I..?
Can I think you're a little weird and also cool..
for telling me the truth
and also want to kiss you?
I guess so.
Can I think it's cool that you kissed me..
and also want to kiss you again?
And be a little concerned about the Magic Markers?
Definitely.
This is Vikram.
Hi,honey,I'm home.
 How was your flight?  It was great.
Why don't you sit down.
Get yourself comfortable.
Because I have a little..
surprise for you.
It must be 5:00 in Tulsa..
because it's "sex o'clock" in N.Y.C.!
Okay. This is how much I love you.
The great white..
Honey?
Why am I watching a bunch of sharks swimming around?
Is this..? Is this not the good part?
Do you want me to fastforward to something.. toothier?
No,I'm just not sure that
you got the right movie,that's all.
This is the only one they had at our video store.
Though they did have something called Crocodile Killers.
Or does it always have to be sharks?
Does what always have to be sharks?
Look,we can do something else.
Do you want me to get into the tub and.. thrash?
What's going on?
It's okay. It's okay.
I still love you.
Let me be a part of this.
Let me be a part of this!
I saw what you were doing in Tulsa.
Angry sharks turn you on!
No,they don't.
Then why were you watching them
and giving yourself a treat?
Oh,my God!
When you came in,I switched the channel.
I was just watching regular porn.
Really?
Yes. Just some good,oldfashioned,
American,girlongirl action.
Can I tell you how happy that makes me?
You are an amazing wife.
Really,you are amazing.
I mean, You were actually gonna do this for me?
Where do you find the strength and the understanding
for something like that?
I'm very,very drunk right now.
Ordinarily,I would talk to her,
but my confidence is shaken.
Did I sleep with her? Did I not sleep with her?
Maybe this is a wakeup call.
You know,about your whole dating attitude.
You're in your 30s
and you have never been in a longterm relationship.
Here you go from woman to woman..
meaningless experience
to meaningless experience.
Never even worrying
that it doesn't turn into something more serious.
You're right. I love my life!
I actually did sleep with her.
Oh,hey,you guys?
I couldn't get a reservation for the night of my birthday..
so we'll have to do dinner Thursday night instead.
Thursday? But that's Halloween.
So?
It's just spooky,that's all.
So,is Mike coming to dinner?
No. It's my first birthday with a boyfriend,
and he has to work.
I'd get mad at him,
but I think it's too soon to show my true colors.
Oh phobs, I would make the reservation for five.
Because one of us has to stay with Emma.
 Which one of us should go to dinner?  Rachel!
Actually,I was thinking maybe both of us could go.
Oh, yeah
Thanks. I'll put a lot of extra thought into your gift.
All right,so great,we can all go now.
That is fun! Hey! You know what?
We all haven't been together,the six of us,in such a long time.
What are you talking about?
We're together now.
Mon? Chandler's not here.
Oh,dear God.
Friends S09E05 The One With Phoebe's Birthday Dinner
Hello. It's nice to see our team together for the first time.
Now,before we get started,
are there any questions?
 Yes. Ken,is it?  That's right.
Is it true the reason you're in Tulsa is,
you fell asleep in a meeting..
and took the job
without realizing what you were saying yes to?
Well,don't believe everything you hear,Ken.
But yeah,that's true.
All right,let's get started
by taking a look at last quarter's figures.
Claudia,aren't you supposed
to blow smoke up the boss's ass?
I'm sorry. Does the smoke bother you?
No. I smoked for years. Then I quit.
Right now,I can't remember why.
You're not allowed to smoke in this office,right?
Yes,in Oklahoma
it's legal to smoke in offices with 15 people or less.
Would you like one?
All right,look. I don't smoke anymore.
But if the rest of you want to light up,
go ahead,it's fine.
So,you all smoke,then?
You know,it's almost rude that I'm not smoking.
That's not true. If you don't want..
Ken,please!
No,I can't. I can't smoke.
If I smoke,my wife would kill me.
I'm sorry,but isn't your wife back in New York?
I've always liked you,Ken.
Trick or treat.
 Hey.  And "treat" it is.
Wow. So glad I changed.
I almost wore my threadbare robe
that can't contain my breasts.
This is not what I'm wearing. I'm ovulating..
and Chandler's gonna be home.
So,I thought we would try before dinner.
Wait,does this mean you'll be late?
Believe me, Chandler and I
haven't seen each other in over a week.
We'll probably be the first ones there.
Okay. See you there. Happy humping.
Wow,somebody smoked out here?
My God,don't people know
you're not allowed to smoke in public spaces?
Actually,in Oklahoma
smoking's legal in offices with fewer than 15 people.
Oh,you smoked.
No. I just happen to know
a lot of trivia about smoking in different states.
For example,in Hawaii,
cigarettes are called leilanalukus.
Oh,Chandler,you stink of cigarettes!
Do you think Monica will smell it?
Are you kidding?
That woman has the nose of a bloodhound.
And the breasts of a Greek goddess.
Phoebe?
I'm gonna go.
Okay. Something to cover the smell.
Oven cleaner.
Unscented.
Welcome home.
I've missed you.
You want to join me in the bedroom?
No,thanks,I'm good.
Okay. So you want to play it that way,do you?
Well,you know what,actually,I just got off a plane..
so I'm feeling gross. I should take a shower.
Come here,you don't need a shower.
All right,the truth is..
I soiled myself during some turbulence.
What do I smell? I smell smoke.
Did you smoke?
Yes. But I just had one.
Two.
Two tiny cigarettes. Okay,five.
A pack. Two pack.. A carton.
Three big fat cartons in two days!
But it's over.
I've made a decision,I'm not gonna smoke anymore.
Well,those are for you.
All right. Well,we'll just see you when you get here. Bye.
Oh,that was my mom. She's stuck in terrible traffic.
Ok, that is now the third sign
that I should not leave Emma.
What are the other two?
Well,the first one is,I don't want to.
And second one,I'm not going.
I know this is the first time we're leaving the baby.
I know how hard it is for you. But..
But everything's gonna be fine.
I mean,my mom is gonna be with her.
 She's great with kids.  She is?
Yeah.
What about Monica?
You only hear Monica's side of that, okay?
that little fatso was a terror!
I just don't think I can do it.
Rach, you know what? You can and you should.
Really,it will be good for you.
In fact,you know what?
Go ahead to the restaurant,and I will wait for my mom..
and then I'll meet you there.
No,no,really,you should go. Go out.
Really,the world is your oyster.
Kick up your heels. Paint the town red!
You need to learn some new slang.
I'm serious. Come on,you should go.
Here. No,just go.
 Well..  No,no! You know what?
You're not getting back in there!
The baby's fine. Now,scram!
Tell your story walking!
I was just going to say that I left my keys.
Holy moley,are we in a pickle now!
Where is everyone? They're 40 minutes late.
 I know.  I'm starving.
I knew we were coming here tonight.
I ate nothing all day.
What about me? I only had one lunch today.
So,are we expecting the rest of our party shortly?
Yes,they are expected presently.
Theirtheir arrival is in the offing.
Right. We have a table for two available.
 Perhaps you'd..  No,they're coming.
We're waiting right here.
Joseph!
One needn't worry. They shan't be long.
It's just that we do have some large parties waiting.
Oh,one really does have a stick up one's ass,doesn't one?
How can you smoke in this day and age?
Have you not seen that ad?
Where the little kid walks through Grandpa?
It's chilling!
I messed up.
It was a meeting. Everybody was smoking.
So what? Don't you have any willpower?
Willpower?
I've watched home movies of you eating Ding Dongs..
without taking the tinfoil off!
You said that was sexy!
Okay,look,can we just drop this?
I'm not gonna smoke again.
That's right,because I forbid you to smoke again.
You forbid me?
You know, I've flown a long way to see my loving wife.
Is she here,by the way?
Chandler,don't joke with me. Okay?
I'm very,very upset right now.
Is this the most upset you could be?
I think so.
Well,then I might as well..
do this.
Not really sure what to do now.
I'll tell you what we're gonna do.
We're already late
for Phoebe's birthday dinner.
So you're going to put out that cigarette..
we're gonna put this fight on hold,and go have sex.
Fine. What?
Sex! This is the last day I'm ovulating.
If we don't do it now..
we're gonna have to wait until next month!
You're serious?
Oh,yeah!
All right,fine,I'll do it,but no talking!
 And no cuddling.  And no kissing your neck.
Oh,good! I hate it when you do that!
And lots of kissing your neck!
Okay,well,the super's not home.
But my mother's gonna be here in any minute,
and she has the key.
I can't wait that long.
You have to do something. Knock that door down!
I would,but I bruise like a peach.
Besides,you know,everything's gonna be fine.
The baby's sleeping.
What if she jumps out of the bassinet?
Can't hold her head up,but jumped.
Oh,my God! I left the water running!
Rach, you did not leave the water running.
Please,pull yourself together,okay?
Well,did I leave the stove on?
You haven't cooked since 1996.
Is the window open? If the window's open
a bird could fly in and..
My God,you know what? I think you're right.
I think, you know what, listen, listen
A pigeon. No. No,wait,no.
An eagle flew in!
Landed on the stove and caught fire!
The baby,seeing this,
jumps across the apartment to the mighty bird's aid.
The eagle,however,misconstrues this as an act of aggression..
and grabs the baby in its talon.
Meanwhile,the faucet
fills the apartment with water.
Baby and bird,still ablaze,
are locked in a death grip..
swirling around the whirlpool that fills the apartment!
Boy,are you gonna be sorry if that's true.
 Hello.  Hi.
It's been an hour.
The maitre d' asked
if you'd reconsider switching to a smaller table.
Maybe we should just eat now.
You can't order until the entire party's arrived.
Restaurant policy.
Well,how about this? Another table leaves,right..
but there's still some food left on their plates.
Okay,what's the restaurant's policy
about people eating that?
 It's frowned upon.  But it happens.
All right,I got to go to the bathroom.
No, you can't go.
No,no,no.
I can't hold this table on my own.
If they ask me to move,I'll cave.
Well,if you ask me to stay,I'll pee.
Good evening,miss.
Miss?
Miss? Miss?
Okay,fine,I'll move.
All right. You don't have to manhandle me.
 Where?  Okay.
Thank you.
Finally. You guys made it.
Phoebe,who the hell..?
Spend more time with the tie!
That will make a baby.
Look,I can't do this.
I can't make love to you
while we're fighting this way.
Oh,sure. Now you're Mr. Sensitivity.
But when you wanted to have sex after my uncle's funeral..
That was a celebration of life!
All right,I'm not gonna do this. all right?
Is this the way you want our baby to be conceived?
No,you're right.
We shouldn't do it like this.
For what it's worth,I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have come down on you so hard about the smoking.
So you had a few cigarettes.
It's not the end of the world.
 Really?  Yeah.
You are incredible.
And listen,I'm not gonna smoke again.
And if I do,I promise I will
hide it so much better from you.
 Want to?  Let's celebrate life!
Okay!
Oh,God.
Oh,thank God you're okay.
I'm sorry we left.
Mommy will never leave you again.
Never,ever,ever again.
Great. So let's get going.
No. I mean it.
After what just happened,
I'm never leaving her again.
I understand. Separation is hard.
One time I was about to leave Ross to go to the beauty parlor.
And he got so upset he took off all his clothes..
tucked his willy between his legs..
and cried out,
"Mommy,I'm a girl. Take me with you."
Somehow,over time,
it got easier to be apart from you.
You are welcome.
You know what? Let's not talk.
What?
I am still so mad at you for smoking!
But you said you forgave me.
It was just a couple of cigarettes,no big deal.
I just said that because I was ovulating
and you said
you wouldn't have sex if we were fighting.
You tricked me to get me into bed?
That's right. I got mine.
I feel so used.
Well,I guess they're not coming.
You want to just order?
Thank you.
Waiter?
All right,this is gonna go fast,so try to keep up.
Risotto with shaved truffles and the rib steak..
with the golden chanterelles and the Bordelaise sauce..
unless any of that stuff I just said means "snails."
It does not.
Tomato tart,and which of the pastas would you recommend?
Oh,well they're both exquisite..
Both it is. Thank you.
Oh,can I make a special request?
Can you bring everything as it's ready?
 Appetizers,entrees,we don't care.  Hey!
I'll wait to put your order in.
You guys are over an hour late.
 What happened to you two?  So sorry.
We got locked out of the apartment.
That's a great story. Can I eat it?
And then Rachel wasn't sure she could leave the baby.
It wasn't easy,but it's your birthday
and I did what I had to do.
And that's Judy over there at the bar with Emma?
This is for the best.
I'm not distracted,worrying about Emma..
how she's doing at home,
and I'm gonna be completely here with you.
Oh,she spit up.
 What?   She spit up.
Judy? She spit.. Judy,look alive,Judy!
 Thank you.  Thanks.
Oh,everything looks delicious.
What should I have? What should I have?
Never hit a woman. Never hit a woman.
I know what you mean,this menu's incredible.
Ross bruises like a peach.
He bruises like a peach.
Okay,I'll have the fig salad and the duck.
I'll have the soup and the salmon.
Remember,whatever comes up first,okay?
 Hurry..  Happy birthday!
Son of a bitch!
 Where have you been?  Well,we had a little fight.
I would never lie to get someone into bed.
You used to tell girls you were a Kennedy.
Thanks.
Thanks. Wow.
A little tight,isn't it?
Why didn't you get a bigger table?
You had a big table but they made you move.
Shut up,Monica.
Oh,well,I suppose that Chandler will have the smoked duck.
And I suppose that Monica will have the manipulative shrew.
I'll give you another minute.
What,where you going?
He said she wanted the shrew!
Rach,come on,Emma's fine.
You're turning into an obsessive mother,okay?
You need to stop.
You ever hear the story about when Ross' mom
went to the beauty salon?
You mean the willy story?
They already know it.
You guys, we've been waiting for you for a long time.
 Maybe you should order.  No, that's okay.
I already told the waiter what they want.
Why would you do that?
Chandler,control your woman.
Okay,well.. Everybody has ordered.
I would like to start the celebration
and make a toast to Phoebe.
 She dropped her sock.  What?
No. No,Emma dropped her sock.
I wanted to have lunch with her today.
She told me she was out of town.
She still has not noticed that
the baby's sock is on the ground.
It's a good toast.
Look,will you please get her attention?
Mommy?
Oh,for God's sake,Judy,pick up the sock!
Pick up the sock! Pick up the sock!
I'm sorry,was that rude?
Did my little outburst..
blunt the hideousness that is this evening?
Look,I know you have a lot going on..
but all I wanted to do was have dinner
with my friends on my birthday.
And you are all so late,
and you didn't even have the courtesy to call.
Well,it's too late now.
Phoebe,I don't think that's us.
Oh,well,this is.. This is not over! Hello?
What is going on with you two?
Well,you see,I'm ovulating.
Oh,yeah,that's what she says.
Maybe you're not ovulating at all.
Maybe it's a clever ruse to get me into bed.
Yeah,Smokey,that's what it was.
I just can't get enough.
You're not gonna believe this.
She lied, she ttricked me into having sex with her.
So? You got to have sex,right?
What's the matter with me? Why am I such a girl?
Okay. That was Mike.
Oh,Phoebe,honey,we are so sorry.
You are totally right.
We are here 100 percent..
and we love you,
and we are ready to start your birthday celebration.
You guys,that means the world to me.
Okay,I'm gonna take off.
What?
I love you guys too,but,Mike got off work early.
Wait.
I'm not the..
I'm not the kind of girl that just ditches her friends..
to be with her boyfriend.
You know what? I am.
Bye,guys. Judy! Bye.
If Phoebe's gone,
can we take Emma home?
I think that's a good idea.
Our babysitter just pounded another chardonnay.
 Bye,you guys.  Bye.
See you.
Well,I guess it's just us.
So,I'm probably still ovulating.
Do you want to give it another try?
So,you've never had sex with a Kennedy,have you?
You're gonna go do it?
We don't have much time.
Once the egg descends into the fallopian tube..
Oh,wait,oh,get out of here!
I sincerely hope the rest of your party is returning.
No,just me. All alone.
Dinner for six for one.
Well,you boys are about to see
something really special.
 How was everything?  Excellent.
The shrew,in particular,was exquisite.
I hope you've got some room left.
Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday to you.
Happy birthday dear...
Joey. Joey.
Joey, Happy birthday to you
This is the best birthday ever!
Hello.
Hello.
I love my new job!
Honey,you're screaming.
You bet your ass I am!
I just had the best first day ever!
The kitchen? Twice as big as Allessandro's.
Oh,that's great.
And clean? Not just health departmentclean,
Monicaclean!
Awesome.
Oh,and the people are so nice.
There's this one guy,Jeffrey,he's the maitre d'.
Chandler,you will love him!
He is without a doubt the funniest guy I have ever met!
Friends S09E06 The One With The Male Nanny
 This is nice.  I know.
You need both hands for that?
Yeah,I kind of do.
Well,how's this?
Look at you two holding hands.
Is this getting serious?
Have you not talked about it yet?
Am I making you uncomfortable?
If you were bigger you'd hit me.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
It's obviously way too early for us
to be having that conversation.
 Is it?  Maybe not. Is it?
When I got divorced..
I didn't think I'd feel this way
about someone for a really long time.
Then again,I didn't think
I'd meet someone like you. And..
This may be crazysoon,
but I want you to have this.
No,not.. That's gum.
Oh,five bucks!
I love it when that happens,you know?
You don't know it's there..
I know. Keep digging.
Sorry.
It's a key.
To be honest,I think I'd prefer the five dollars.
 It's to my apartment.  Wow!
Big step for Phoebe and Mike.
Yeah, look, I don't want you to feel like
you have to give me your key..
Just because...
 No,I want to.  Thank God.
Wow. I was starting to think
I'd never meet someone that..
I wanted to do this with.
Here you go.
 This is cool.  It really is.
I know it. It is amazing.
These little things open doors!
So I don't go back to work for another four weeks..
but we would like our nanny to start right away..
so that Emma could get a chance to know her.
I think that's really smart.
The easier we can make the transition for her the better.
That's great. Great.
So do you have any questions for us?
Not really.
All right. Well,thank you so much for coming.
 Thank you.  It was really nice to meet you.
 We will call you.  Oh,you know,wait.
I do have one question.
Do you guys do random drug testing?
Boy,we hadn't really thought of that.
That's cool. But if you do,
I'm gonna need three days' notice.
Okeydokey!
We're never gonna find a nanny.
Come on,Rach.
We will. I promise.
We have more interviews.
Worse comes to worst,
we can always reconsider the first one we met with.
What,the blond with no bra?
She was blond?
Just a sec.
Okay,this one's name is Sandy.
She's got a degree in Early Childhood Education.
She worked for her last family for three years.
Hi. I'm Sandy.
And she's a little mannish.
Oh,my God! David!
Is this a bad time?
No,it's a great time! Come in!
Oh,my gosh! What are you doing here?
Are you back from Minsk?
Just for a couple of days.
I'm here to explain to the people who gave us our grant..
why it's a positive thing that we've spent all their money..
and accomplished nothing.
Who cares? It got you here.
It got me to New York anyway.
Then I got in a cab at the airport..
and the guy said,"Where to?"
I just gave him your address. I didn't even think about it.
Where's your luggage?
Damn it.
All right,I'll call the cab company.
Wait, wait, We can call them later.
Can you just stand there for a moment?
Boy.
There's an old Russian expression that goes:
Roughly translated,that means:
"This thing that I'm looking at: Wow."
Thank you.
You should see me when..
Actually,no,I look pretty good.
Are you kidding?
You know,when you don't see someone for a long time..
you build them up in your head,
you start thinking:
"Come on,don't be crazy,
nobody's that beautiful."
But,well,you are.
Well,so are you seeing anyone?
No.
I'm just the worst person ever!
How can I not tell David
that I'm seeing Mike?
Maybe he didn't give you a chance.
He said,"Are you seeing someone?" and I said,"No."
Well,that would've been your window.
I mean,I don't know. I was looking in his eyes..
and I was just thinking,
"Oh,my God,it's David. David's here."
He's so irresistible.
Really? The scientist guy?
Really? Chandler?
Continue.
Then it gets worse..
because I told him I would see him tomorrow night.
 Phoebe!  I know! Evil!
I like Mike so much,you know?
It's just going really well. Oh,my God!
Isn't it ironic that David would show up..
on the same day that you and Mike exchange keys?
Yeah. You know,
and given my lifelong search for irony..
you can imagine how happy I am!
 What are you gonna do?  I mean,I guess I just have to..
tell David that nothing can happen between us.
Unless I don't.
You know,complicated moral situation?
No right,no wrong?
You have to tell David.
Ok, I knew I should've had this conversation with Joey.
Funniest guy she's ever met.
I'm funny,right?
What do you know? You're a door.
You just like knockknock jokes.
Save it for inside.
So Oklahoma's a crazy place.
You know,they call it the Sooner State.
Frankly,I'd sooner be in any other state!
And what's with Oklahoma having a panhandle?
Can all states have stuff like that?
Hey,yeah,I'm from the waistband of Wyoming.
But when I was 7,
we headed over to the crotch.
Was your cabin pressurized?
And don't get me started on the way
the people from Tulsa talk.
Okay.
What's with the word "y'all"?
You know,just two words just pushed together?
Are we all allowed to do that?
Because if so,I say why stop there?
You know,your new poodle could be your noodle.
And fried chicken could be fricken.
Waiter? Waiter,
excuse me,I'll have the fricken!
See,that's funny with the fricken,right?
No,it just reminds me
of something this guy did today at work.
I told you about
that funny guy,Jeffrey,right?
Yeah,he came up.
Well,he did this bit.
You probably had to be there..
but it was Liza Minnelli locked in our freezer
eating a raw chicken.
Were you there?
No,but it sounds fricken funny.
I really understand
how hard it's gotta be to leave your child with another person.
I mean,it's like leaving behind a piece of your heart.
Sandy,that's exactly what it is.
Are you gay?
It's okay. I get that a lot doing what I do.
But I am straight. I'm engaged,actually.
 Her name's Delia.  That's pretty.
So you're just,like,a guy who's a nanny.
I realize how it's a bit unorthodox for some people.
But I really believe
the most satisfying thing you can do with your life..
is take care of a child.
Okay.
Like at my last job.
I met Daniel when he was 3 weeks old.
And I got to watch him grow into this awesome person.
When I left,
I said,"I'll see you soon."
And he said to me,"Skadandy?"
That was his name for me.
"I'll see you every day right in.."
It's okay.
Yeah,kids say all kinds of crap.
Oh,God,she must need her diaper changed.
I can take care of that,if you want.
That would be great.
I love him,I love him,I love him!
Come on. Rach,he's a guy!
So what? He's smart. He's qualified.
Give me one good reason we shouldn't try him out.
Because it's weird!
Why?
What kind of a job is that for a man? A nanny?
I mean,it's like if a woman wanted to be..
Yes?
King?
I hope you don't mind.
I used some of my homemade lotion on Emma.
It's a mixture of calendula and honey cream.
It'll dry that rash right up.
Plus,it keeps the hands young.
Yes! Sandy,you're hired!
That's great!
I'm sorry.
It's just such an emotional thing
when you're welcomed into a new family.
Oh,God. Come here.
You gotta be at least bi.
I need you to set me up for a joke.
later when Monica's around,
I need you to ask me about fire trucks.
I don't know,Chandler.
I'm not so good with remembering lines.
Thank God your livelihood doesn't depend on it.
I know,right?
Why are we doing this?
Monica says that her maitre d'
is the funniest guy she's ever met.
Seriously? She actually said that?
Yes. Am I crazy to be this upset?
 No! Being funny's your thing!  Yeah!
Without that,you just got "lame with women"!
Hi! There you are.
Fire trucks!
Wow. You look even more beautiful than you did yesterday.
In fact,I'm going to kiss you now.
 Wait,wait.  I can't get away with stuff like that.
It sounded sexy in my head,so I..
No,no,it's not that.
Remember when you asked me if I was seeing someone
and I said no?
Well,I am. His name's Mike.
 I should've told you.  No.
Well,yeah.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Well,it's okay. I understand.
Well,are you happy with this guy?
 I am happy.  Damn it.
I'm sorry. I don't mean that.
I want you to be happy.
But only with me.
No,that's not fair.
Who cares. Leave him.
I don't mean that.
Yes,I do. I'm sorry.
I think I should probably go.
But,David,I just want you to know that,you know..
telling you this
is one of the hardest things I've ever had to do.
Well,just so you know..
hearing it wasn't exactly a Vladnik carnival,either.
Can we at least hug goodbye?
Of course. Yeah.
You know,and a kiss on the cheek
wouldn't be totally inappropriate.
 No. No.  I mean..
 In Minsk?  Yeah?
It's two on each cheek..
and one on the lips.
Well,if that's what they do in Minsk.
In New York,it's..
Oh,boy.
Is everything all right?
Oh,yeah. No,it's fine. It's fine.
Sandy was just telling me
about how he proposed to his fiancee..
and it was so beautiful.
Her favorite flower is the camellia. From the poem..
I can't hear it again!
You know,I can't tell it again!
And I'm fine never having heard it.
Rach,can I see you for a sec?
Yeah. Excuse me.
Do you realize that man
has cried in our apartment three times?
I haven't cried that many times since I moved in!
Look,Ross,Sandy's just sensitive.
That's all.
Okay,okay. See,that is the problem.
He is too sensitive.
Too sensitive to take care of our baby?
No,I mean,that guy..
These are amazing!
Sandy made madeleines.
This is exactly what I'm talking about.
What kind of a guy makes delicate French cookies?
They're not even butch,
manly cookies with..
You know,with chunks!
Well,you know,I don't know what to say.
I mean,I never thought of you as a guy
who needed his men to be men.
I gotta tell you,Ross,
it's not like you just came in from branding cattle.
Hey,there's sensitive and there's too sensitive.
Okay,what is too sensitive?
No,I can't.
I can't do this. It's bad.
But it's nice. And nice is good.
And good is not bad.
Ergo,we should keep kissing.
 No,no. No.  But..
Ergo.
Look,David,if you had never left,then..
yeah,we'd probably still be together right now.
But you did leave.
And I'm with Mike and I really care about him.
Goodbye.
The key works.
And,you,thanks for the face massage! Thank you!
Did Rachel tell you we hired a male nanny?
 I think that's great!  Oh,really?
Did she tell you he plays the recorder,recites poetry
and bakes madeleines?
How are they?
Lighter than air,but that's not the point.
Rachel and I hired a male nanny.
Really?
Guys do that?
 That's weird.  Thank you!
 That's like a woman wanting to be..  What?
What's the end of that sentence?
Yes. What is the end of that sentence?
A penis model!
Anyway,did you tell Chandler that some guy from work..
is the funniest guy you ever met?
 Yeah. So?  Wow!
Really? Do you not know Chandler?
Is that why he's acting so weird?
He's jealous?
Oh,my God,that is crazy.
 It's not like I'm attracted to Jeffrey.  So what?
Being funny is Chandler's thing.
Like Ross' thing is..
Science?
Academia? Being a good father?
No.
I can't believe he's that upset this.
Monica, you have to do some damage control.
Because he's feeling like..
What are you guys talking about?
Rachel and I hired a male nanny.
You got a man who's a nanny?
You got a "manny"?
You know,I don't mind a male nanny..
but I do draw the line at male wet nurse.
You are on a roll,mister!
If I'd known you guys were coming over,
I would've brought more pizza.
Okay! Okay! Stop it,you! You stop it!
What is so funny about that?
I don't know,it's.. Just the way you say it.
I mean,you're funny.
You have that funny thing. You're a funny guy!
Did you tell her what we talked about?
So those were pity laughs? Pity laughs?!
Honey,listen.
You have nothing to worry about with Jeffrey.
Oh,yeah? Is he funnier than me?
Well,you're different funny.
I mean,you're more sarcastic.
Well,he does bits and impressions and limericks.
I do limericks.
There once was a man named Chandler
whose wife made him die inside.
Honey,you know I think you're hilarious.
You know that joke you told me last week?
The one about Jerry Lewis
and the girl with the lazy eye.
That slayed me.
Hey! I made up that joke and told it to you.
Not knowing when to shut up.
Yep,that's my thing.
So how many guys have your key?
No, It's not as bad as it looks.
I was saying goodbye to an old friend.
Your lipstick's on his mouth.
We just happen to wear the same shade.
No,David and I did used to go out.
But years ago.
And he lives in Minsk.
He's only in town for a couple days.
 Did you..?  No. No.
 Kiss him?  Oh,well,yeah.
Yes,but.. Look,she really likes you.
I don't think you realize just how lucky you are,fella.
 Don't point your finger at me!  Why?
What are you gonna do about it?
Well,I'll show you what I'm gonna do about it.
You want some of that?
Oh,really? Really?
Stop it! Stop it!
Before someone gets really hurt!
Here,David,you should just go.
All right.
But if I ever do come back from Minsk,well,
you just better watch out.
If I go to Minsk,you better watch out.
Oh,you're going to Minsk?
 Well,I might.  Really?
Well,if you do,come in the spring.
It's just lovely there.
Okay,well,guys?
 Goodbye,Phoebe.  Bye.
Hey,what,are you kidding me?
Righto. Righto.
Take good care of her.
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
If you want your key back,I totally understand.
It's never gonna happen again,right?
Right. Never. I swear.
I just want to say,
if you do ever come to Minsk,that's my number.
We'll party up Vladnikstyle.
Yeah! All right!
Hey,Ross! Check it out!
Sandy taught me "Hot Cross Buns"!
Really? Sounded like "Three Blind Mice."
No, "Three Blind Mice" goes like this.
I swear to God.
Who's up for puppets?
Me! I'm up for puppets!
Well,please welcome:
The Snufflebumps!
Who wants to be Mr. Wigglemunch
and who's gonna be the Grumpus?
Ok, ok, how exactly is a 2monthold
supposed to appreciate puppets?
Actually studies show that the movement and colors
help their cerebral development.
The whimsical characters are just for us.
I want to be Mr. Wigglemunch!
Oh,my God.
Well,I guess we know who's gonna be the Grumpus!
That was kind of rude.
Oh,I'm sorry.
Please apologize to Sandy and the Snufflebumps for me.
You know,he was just doing his job.
You know what?
I'm sorry I'm the only one
who isn't in love with Gary Poppins out there.
But I just.. I can't go through with this.
 Come on.  No! You know what?
I'm sorry, I would never force you
to hire someone you were this uncomfortable with.
That's true.
Thank you.
You want to fire him,so you have to go do it.
So you see,Wigglemunch,
that's why it's important to share.
I am learning so much from you.
Well,I'm off to Tulsa.
So if your maitre d' friend
has any funny Oklahoma jokes..
tell him to email me at
wwwdothahanotsomuchdotcom!
Honey,you can relax.
Last night at work Jeffrey told
this really sexist joke.
After that,not so funny anymore.
Really?
See,that's the thing.
You gotta keep it smart,people!
Don't miss that flight. You know I love you.
I love you too.
 And I like you as a friend.  Right.
 See you later.  See you.
Did the guy really make that joke?
No,he still kills me.
Last night he had me laughing so hard,
I swear a little pee came out.
Here goes.
I can't watch.
It's like firing Elmo.
Sandy? Hi.
 Hi.  We..
We kind of need to talk.
I'm afraid it's not working out.
I mean,Rachel and I think
you are great with Emma.
 We just feel..  You! You feel!
I just feel that the..
chemistry isn't right. I'm sorry.
We're more than happy to give you a good recommendation.
No, no, that's okay.
I just picked you guys because..
I liked you the best.
Oh,damn you,Geller!
Anyway,well I'm glad there's no hard feelings.
No, none at all.
You need to be happy with whoever is in your home.
Although,if you don't mind telling me..
what was the problem?
Maybe it's something I can work on in the future.
No,you know,it's nothing you did. It's my issue.
What is it?
Please?
You know,I'm just not that comfortable with
a guy who's as sensitive as you.
That's fair.
Although,can I ask,why do you think that is?
Why? I don't know.
Maybe because of my father?
You know,when I was growing up,
he was a tough guy.
You know,and as a kid,I wasn't the athlete I am now.
I play squash!
Anyway,I always got the feeling he thought I was too sensitive.
That must have been hard.
It was hard.
I remember I was in my bedroom,
playing with my dinosaurs..
Playing and learning.
And my father walks in and says,
he said, "What are you doing with those things?
What's wrong with you?
Why aren't youwhy aren't you outside
playing like a real boy?"
But you are a real boy.
I know I am!
And when it's summer and it's hot,
why can't you wear a tank top?!
It's all right. Listen, crying is good.
It lets the boohoos out.
Here comes some more!
And what's the one kind of boat that can never ever sink?
 What kind?  A friend ship!
Wow! You blow my mind!
I gotta go.
 How much do I owe you?  Twenty bucks.
It's like the cheapest college ever!
And that's why,no matter what Mommy says..
we really were on a break. Yes,we were.
Yes,we were. Come here,gorgeous.
Look at you. You are the cutest little baby ever.
You're just a littlebitty baby,you know that?
But you've got..
You've got big,beautiful eyes.
Yes,you do.
And a.. And a big,round belly.
Big baby butt.
I like big butts.
I like big butts and I can not lie
You other brothers can't deny
when the girl walks in with an itty bitty waist
And a round thing in your face
You get...
Oh,my God,Emma. You're laughing.
Oh,my God. You've never done that before,have you?
You've never done that before.
Daddy made you laugh,huh?
Well,Daddy and Sir MixALot.
What? What? You wanna hear some more?
I'm a terrible father.
Friends S09E07 The One With Ross's Inappropriate Song
 What do you know about investments?  How come?
I'm starting to make good money on the show,
and I should do something with it.
What do you do with your money now?
It's taped to the back of my toilet tank.
I didn't say that.
It's in a bank guarded by robots.
Do you have any ideas?
A guy at work got me excited..
about going in on an emu farm. That'd be kind of cool,huh?
Pitching in on the weekends,
helping to plant the emus.
Joe,emus are birds.
You raise them for meat.
Yeah. Right!
People eat birds. Bird meat.
Do they just fly into your mouth?
Or you go in a restaurant and say:
"Excuse me,I'll have a bucket of fried bird."
Or maybe just a wing. Or a.
Joey, I think you should consider
something a little less risky.
I think in this market
real estate is your best investment.
The Fed just lowered the rates,
and the interest on your mortgage is totally deductible.
That's right. I know some stuff.
Real estate,huh?
And you know who's selling a great apartment? Richard!
And you know whose knowledge of her exboyfriend
is shocking? Monica!
My dad told me. They play golf together.
Well,maybe I'll join them sometime.
I just hope the club doesn't slip out of my hand..
and beat the mustache off his face.
Listen, You have to help me pick a dress.
I'm meeting Mike's parents tonight.
Wow,the boyfriend's parents. That's a big step.
Really? That hadn't occurred to me.
They are gonna love you. Just be yourself.
They live on the Upper East Side on Park Avenue.
Yeah,she can't be herself.
Okay,so,all right,which dress?
You can say neither.
Oh,God. Neither.
I'm sorry. We'll take you shopping.
It'll be fine.
Totally, you are in such good hands,
and I am so good with meeting parents.
With the father,you wanna flirt a little,
but not in a gross way.
Just kind of like,"Mr. Pinzer,
I can see
where Wallace gets his good looks."
You went out with Wallace Pinzer?
He took the SATs for me.
I knew you didn't get a 1400!
Yeah,well,duh! I mean..
So now,what about with Mike's mom?
Well,with the mother,
just constantly tell her
how amazing her son is.
Take it from me. Moms love me.
Ross' mom one time actually said..
I am like the daughter that she never had.
She said what?
She's like the daughter she never had.
Listen.
I just finish getting Phoebe all dressed
to meet Mike's parents.
She's so nervous. It's so sweet.
Guess what. I made Emma laugh today.
You what? And I missed it..
because I was giving a makeover to that stupid hippie?!
Yeah,and it was like a real little person laugh too.
It was like:
Only not creepy.
 What did you do to make her laugh?  I..
Well,I sang. Actually..
I rapped..
"Baby Got Back."
You what?
You sang to our baby daughter..
a song about a guy who likes to have sex..
with women with giant asses?
You know what,if you think about it..
it actually promotes a healthy body image..
because even big butts..
or "juicy doubles" are..
Please don't take her away from me.
Hi,come on in. I'm Catherine,the listing agent.
Hi,I'm Joey. This is Chandler.
So how come Richard's selling the place?
Went bankrupt?
Medical malpractice? Choked on his own mustache?
Actually he's buying a much bigger place.
It's got a great view of Central Park..
That's enough out of you.
Is there anything we should know about the place?
All the appliances are included.
There's a lot of light,a new kitchen.
I think you guys would be very happy here.
No.
No,we're not together.
We're not a couple
We're definitely not a couple.
 Okay. Sorry.  That's all right.
Wow,you seemed pretty insulted by that.
What,I'm not good enough for you?
We are not gonna have this conversation again.
Look at this place.
Why am I so intimidated by this guy?
Pretentious art. This huge,macho couch.
When we know all he does is sit around all day..
crying about losing Monica
to a real man.
You don't think he's here,do you?
You know, It's a nice place,but I gotta say,
I don't know if I see myself living here.
Well,let me see.
Yeah,I can see it.
Look at these videos. I mean,who does he think he is?
Magnum Force,Dirty Harry,Cool Hand Luke.
 Oh,my God.  What?
There's a tape here with Monica's name on it.
A tape with a girl's name on it.
It's probably a sex tape.
Wait a minute.
This says "Monica."
And this is Richard's apartment.
Get there faster!
Wow. You look..
like my mom.
I'm wearing pantyhose.
 Great! Come on in.  Okay.
Thank you.
Oh,my God. You're rich.
No,my parents are rich.
Well,so? They gotta die someday.
Hello!
Mom,Dad,this is Phoebe.
Phoebe,these are my parents,Theodore and Bitsy.
Theodore,Bitsy..
what a delight.
It's so nice to finally meet you.
And you.
Your home is lovely.
Thank you. I'll give you a tour later.
It's actually three floors.
Holy crap!
Phobe, Why don't you come meet our friends.
Try and stop me.
What are you doing?
Trying to get your parents to like me.
I'm sure they will,but you don't have to do this.
I want them to get to know Phoebe,
not "Phoebe."
 You've got it.  All right.
It's hard to stop.
Well,come on.
Phoebe,these are our friends
Tom and Sue Engel.
Phoebe,come sit.
Tell us a little bit about yourself.
 So where are you from?  Okay.
Well,all right. Originally,I'm from upstate..
but then my mom killed herself,
and my stepdad went to prison.
So I moved to the city,
where I lived in a burnedout Buick LeSabre for a while.
Which was okay. That was okay.
Until I got hepatitis,you know..
because this pimp spit in my mouth and..
But I got over it.
And,anyway,
now I'm a freelance massage therapist..
which isn't always steady money,
but at least I don't pay taxes.
So where does everyone summer?
Oh,God,this is not going well.
No,you're doing fine. Really.
Why don't you go talk to my dad.
Okay,okay,okay.
Still sure about me being myself?
Absolutely.
Though maybe just a little less "pimp spit."
So,Theodore,I can see
where Mike gets his good looks from.
You must work out all the time.
Not all the time. I do the best I can.
Yeah,I bet. Look out!
Oh,my God. Are you okay?
I recently had surgery.
 I'm so sorry.  No,I'll be fine.
I just should check the stitches.
I really really am sorry.
How could you know?
Why wouldn't you punch me in the stomach?
Did you just hit my dad?
Yes. I'm sorry.
I've never met a boyfriend's parents before.
But,I mean,you have met humans before,right?
Why don't you go talk to my mom.
Okay,yeah,your mom. Ok.
She looks nice. I can talk to her.
Yeah. You do that,and I'm gonna go check
my dad for signs of internal bleeding.
Bitsy? Listen,I wanted to thank you again
for having me here tonight.
Well,not at all.
Also,I just want you to know
what a wonderful man your son is.
Thank you. I think so too.
It's a testament to how he was raised.
Especially to you,
because he's very respectful of women.
Is he really?
Are you kidding? He is so considerate of my feelings.
You know,I think you'd also like to know
that he is a very gentle lover.
Excuse me?
No,don't get me wrong.
No, he is not in like a sissy way.
No, no, When he gets going..
he can rattle a headboard like a sailor on leave.
That's.. my boy.
Awesome.
I'm not gonna watch it. I don't need to watch it.
I mean,what good could possibly come from watching it?
Well,we know I'm gonna watch it.
Hey,dude,what's up?
Don't judge me! I'm only human!
Did you take that tape?
I had to! OK? Imagine you were married
and you found a tape of your wife..
in another guy's apartment.
Wouldn't you need to know what was on it?
I don't know. Who am I married to?
Some girl.
She hot?
How did she get me to settle down?
All right,I'm gonna watch it.
I mean,it's probably not even what I think it is.
Even if it is,it can't possibly be
as bad as what I'm picturing in my head.
Can it?
Settle on my experience,
if a girl says yes to being taped..
she doesn't say no to much else,I'll tell you.
 Then you have to watch it for me.  What?
Just for a few seconds so I can know what it is.
Please?
All right,fine.
But if I enjoy this,
you have only yourself to blame!
Why am I hearing cheering?
It's okay. It's just a football game.
Football? It's just football?
You were all worried for nothing.
It's football! It's just football!
This is great!
This is the first time I've ever enjoyed football!
I think it may be customary to get a beer.
What the..?
What are you doing?
You don't wanna see what I just saw!
What are you guys doing?
Oh,my God! Is that Richard?
Okay,please laugh for Mommy. Please?
Please laugh for Mommy.
Not funny,huh?
Well,so is it..
only offensive novelty rap?
Or maybe just,you know,rap in general.
Because Mommy can rap.
My name is mommy
And I'm here to say
That all the babies are
I can't rap.
All right,sweetheart.
This is only because I love you so much.
And I know that you're not gonna tell anybody.
I like big butts and I can not lie
You other brothers can't deny
when the girl walks in with an itty bitty waist
And a round thing in your face
Yes! Yes! Yes!
I like big butts and I can not lie
You other brothers can't deny
Emma,you're laughing! You are!
You really do like big butts,don't you?
You beautiful little weirdo.
You missed it! She was laughing!
It was amazing.
It was amazing.
It was the most beautiful,beautiful sound.
I know,isn't it?
What'd you do to get her to laugh?
You know,I just.. A couple of things I tried. Different..
Just sang a little "The ItsyBitsy Spider."
You sang "Baby Got Back," didn't you?
Nothing else worked!
That girl is all about the ass!
And then it goes back to the chorus.
And that's the end of the song.
I realize you hadn't asked to hear it..
but no one had spoken in 17 minutes.
Phoebe writes lots of great songs.
What was that one you sang the other night
that everybody just loved?
"Pervert Parade"?
 "Ode to a Pubic Hair"?  Stop.
Oh,God. Is that veal?
Mom,I thought I told you,
Phoebe's a vegetarian.
No,that's okay. That's okay.
I mean,I am a vegetarian..
except for veal. Yeah. No. Veal I love.
Phoebe,you don't have to eat that.
No, no, no, actually
Any baby animals. Kittens,fish babies.
But,you know,especially veal.
You know,and this nice vein of fat running through it.
Yummy.
So..
what do you think?
So you stole that tape from Richard's apartment?
Listen to the judgment from the porn star!
That tape was never meant to be seen by..
Joey,I would feel more comfortable
if this conversation were in private.
Monica,look,I don't think
you and I have any secrets anymore.
Not ready to joke about it yet?
Ok, I'll see you later.
Why in the world would you take this tape?
And why would you watch it?
Because that's who I am. Okay?
I'm sure a man like Richard
could see a tape like that and not be bothered.
It'd just be another saucy anecdote..
for him to share at his men's club
over brandy and mustaches.
Is all of this about you not being able to grow a mustache?
This is about you and Richard.
He's clearly not over you.
He keeps a tape
so he can look at it whenever he wants.
Isn't that sad?
Can't you see how pathetic that is?
Don't be jealous. You should feel bad for him.
Yeah,well,poor Richard,he..
I can grow a mustache.
Chandler, this is not our problem.
We have each other. That's all that matters.
Yeah, but I just keep picturing
you rolling around with him,
with your..
cowboy boots in the air.
Cowboy boots?
I've never worn cowboy boots in my whole life.
Good,good.
Play more because I wanna see how it ends.
 That's not me!  What?
That's not you! Life is good again!
Ride 'em,cowgirl!
That bastard taped over me!
Is that a problem?
It's just so insulting.
Spring for a new blank tape,doctor!
I can't imagine what he sees in her.
She actually makes me miss that pillpopping exwife of his.
Hello,dear.
What's going on?
We were just chitchatting.
 How's your friend?  A little better.
By the way, do you know who's moving back into town?
Tom and Sue's daughter,Jen.
You remember her,Michael.
She's lovely,wellbehaved and single.
I'm not interested.
Please,darling,let's be honest.
You can have all the sailor fun you want with that one.
 But let's be real.  All right,stop.
All Phoebe has done tonight
is try and get you to like her.
Maybe it hasn't been clear all the time
but she did her best.
She's a little different than you are.
Michael,a pimp spit in her mouth.
So what? If I can get past that,
it shouldn't bother you.
You don't have to like her.
Just accept the fact that I do.
If you can't even be civil to the woman I love..
The woman you what?
Yeah,the woman you what?
The woman I love.
I love you.
Just something I probably shouldn't say for the first time,
in front of my parents..
and Tom and Sue.
Who are,by the way,
the most sinfully boring people I've ever met in my life.
 I love you too.  You do?
How great is this?
 Wanna get out of here?  Ok
Mom,Dad. Thanks for dinner.
I had a great time.
It was really topdrawer. And here's something rich.
Thirteen bathrooms in this place,
I threw up in the coat closet.
Tata!
She's Sweat,Wet,
got it goin like a turbo vette
Fellas, Fellas,
Has your girlfriend got the butt
Hell yeah.
So shake it, shake it
shake that healthy butt
Baby got back
One more time from the top!
I like big butts and I can not lie
You other brothers...
Rachel,please! That is so inappropriate!
Hey,hon? Would you help me get the plates down?
Yeah. Hey,here's an idea.
Why don't we use our wedding china today?
No,I just think we should save our china
for something really special.
Like if the queen of England comes over.
Honey,she keeps canceling on us.
Take the hint.
What if something breaks? They're expensive.
What is the point of having them if we never use them?
Okay. But if something breaks
and then the queen comes over..
I will explain it to her.
Like I'd let you talk to the queen.
Wow,the parade is really good this year.
Man,those horses can crap.
Next up is a marching band
from Muskogee,Oklahoma.
Muskogee? That's like four hours from Tulsa!
And here's the float with
the stars of the popular daytime soap.. Days of Our Lives.
Oh,my God!
Aren't you one of the stars of the popular daytime soap
Days of our Lives?
Yeah. I forgot! I'm supposed to be there!
I can't believe I forgot!
I usually write stuff like this down on my arm!
Stupid long sleeves!
What are you gonna do?
I'll come up with a good reason..
why I wasn't there.
The producers are gonna be mad.
They sat us down and said:
"Everyone has to be there,6 a.m. sharp.
That means you,Tribbiani."
Like I was some kind of idiot.
Well,you proved them wrong.
Friends S09E08 The One With Rachel's Other Sister
Oh,Emma.
This is your first Thanksgiving.
What are you thankful for?
Mommy's boobies?
A lot of people are thankful for those.
Hello? Rachel?
Who is it?
It's your favorite sister.
 Jill?  Amy!
Hide my rings.
Amy! Happy Thanksgiving.
Do you have a hair straightener?
Hair straightener.
I haven't seen you in,like,a year.
I know. I know. I've just been crazed.
Well,me too. I had a baby.
I decorated Dad's office.
Yeah? Well,unless you pushed a desk out of your vagina,
not the same thing.
Listen, about that hair straightener,
honey,I really need one.
I'm gonna have dinner at my boyfriend's house.
Oh,my God.
Is this Emmett?
It's Emma.
It's a girl?
Hey,Amy.
Amy,you remember Ross?
Not really.
But you are much cuter than that geeky guy she used to date.
That was me.
No,he was this creepy guy from high school
who had this huge crush on her since,like,the ninth grade.
Still me.
No,I'm not talking about you.
It was your fat friend's brother
with that bad Afro.
Okay,Amy,I'm gonna save you some time,okay?
All me!
Careful. Careful.
Careful!
I'll tell you what. For the rest of our lives..
I'll be careful until told otherwise.
 This isn't the china we picked out.  I know.
After you left the store,I chose different ones.
 Why?  No offense, honey.
Your taste is a little feminine for me.
Suddenly flowers are feminine?
Hey,everybody! Happy Thanksgiving!
Happy Thanksgiving. Phoebe!
What's going on,Joe?
Listen,I need a good lie.
Okay.
How about the whole "man walking on the moon" thing,you know?
You can see the strings,people!
No,no,no. I need a good lie to explain
why I wasn't at a work thing today.
Honey,you stink at lying.
I do not.
Really? Let me ask you something.
Yesterday at the coffeehouse..
I went to the bathroom.
When I came back,my muffin was gone.
Who took it?
Somebody opened the door to the coffeehouse..
and a raccoon ran in
and went straight for your muffin. I said:
"Hey,don't eat that! That's Phoebe's!"
And he said..
He said,"Joey,you stink at lying."
What am I gonna do?
Don't worry. We'll come up with a lie.
I'll help you practice.
Great. That'd be great. Thank you.
Sure. What was the work thing?
 "Pick up Grandma at the airport."  Oh,man!
She's precious.
Do you ever worry
that she's gonna get your real nose?
Amy..
Yes,I do. I really do.
Hello?
Yeah,hang on,one sec. Can I take this upstairs?
Sure. We don't live there,but..
Seriously? It's just these rooms?
I thought you were a doctor.
Yeah. No,Ross has a Ph.D.
God,she is unbelievable.
I know. I mean,a Ph.D. is just as good as an MD.
Sure,Ross,yeah!
If I have a heart attack at a restaurant,
I want you there with your fossil brush.
 Stupid Thanksgiving.  What?
What? What happened?
My boyfriend canceled on me.
I mean,I finally find a real relationship.
Someone that I can spend this day with,
and then his wife comes back into town!
I swear,it's almost not even worth dating married guys.
Don't say that.
God,I was so looking forward to this.
It was gonna be such a beautiful Thanksgiving.
We were gonna have sushi.
Amy,don't cry.
Ross,can I talk to you in private?
Sure,you wanna go upstairs,or..?
Look,I was thinking,if it's okay with Monica..
I would like to invite Amy to Thanksgiving.
You know, I think that's a great idea.
It'll be like the Pilgrims
bringing the Indians syphilis.
Look,I know she's a little tough to take.
But she has nowhere else to go,
and she's my sister. She's Emma's aunt.
And I would like them to bond.
Ok, fine. I don't want them bonding too much.
I don't want her telling Emma she needs a nose job.
Ross,she may need one.
We're just gonna have to make our peace with that!
Hey,you guys. This is my sister,Amy.
This is Chandler,Joey,Phoebe,
and you know Mon.
Oh,my God.
You're on Days of Our Lives!
Yeah.
Wow! They must put a lot of makeup on you.
Happy Thanksgiving.
So welcome. Is this the first time you're seeing Emma?
Yeah,I think so.
It's nice to meet you,Emma.
 Phoebe.  That's a funny noise.
 Phoebe? I still need some help here.  Right. Okay.
So it's not just the lie you tell,
but it's the way you tell it. For example..
if you look at the ground when you're talking,
people know you're lying.
I don't know why this is so hard for me.
Lying is basically just acting..
and I am a terrific actor.
You are a terrific actor.
Hey. Where's the baby?
We just put her down for a nap.
Listen,I was just thinking.
You know what would be incredible?
If you guys died!
Thank you,Amy.
No,no,then I would get the baby.
It would be just like a movie.
At first I wouldn't know what to do with her.
And then I would rise to the occasion.
Then I'd get a makeover and get married.
That's a great movie!
Now,listen,not that you guys could stop me or anything..
because you know,you'd be dead.
But I was thinking about changing her name.
I'm just not really a big fan of Emily.
Emma.
Emma? Ross wants you.
Phoebe!
Why does she keep making that noise?
Honey,I don't know how to tell you this..
but if something were to happen to Ross or myself..
you wouldn't get the baby.
Well,who would?
Well,we haven't officially asked them yet..
but we would want Monica and Chandler.
I can't believe you'd want us to raise Emma.
Oh,my God,I'm so moved.
I don't believe this. Hold on a second. You guys die..
and I don't get your baby?
Amy,see,we're a lot closer to Monica and Chandler.
We see them every day.
And truthfully,you don't seem connected to the baby.
Connected? To what? She's a lump.
You know,guys,I've gotta say this means so much to me.
I mean,that you would trust me
with your child.
I mean,we all know that Monica and I have been..
trying to have a baby of our own.
You know,I've had my doubts about my skills as a father,
but.. that you two..
 That you two..  This guy?
Seriously?
Okay,it's time for dinner.
Everyone,we're using our fancy china..
and it's very expensive,so please be careful.
Okay,just to be clear,
comedy with the plates will not be wellreceived.
How come my plate's less fancy than everyone else's?
Do you not trust me with a fancy plate?
No,honey. That's a special plate.
See,it's a game.
Whoever gets that plate wins.
I can't believe I won!
You know,this is such a slap in the face.
I mean,I'm your sister..
and you would give your baby to these strangers over me.
Monica is Ross' sister.
No,Ross' sister was really fat.
That was me.
No,she was this dorky girl in school
who followed Rachel around like a puppy..
Amy,you've got to stop doing that!
Okay,listen,I know you're having a bit of a family crisis..
but you don't have to take it out on the plates.
I mean,in fact,I think that everyone..
should cut their food like this:
Now,see?
This way,you protect the plates..
and let's face it,you have fun.
Okay,how about this? If you guys die..
and the crazy plate lady dies..
then do I get the baby?
No,if crazy plate lady..
If Monica dies,
then I would get Emma. Right?
 Well,actually..  Actually what?
It's just.. It's just that in that case..
then Emma would go to my parents.
 What?  Hurts,doesn't it?
Who has to die for me to get her?
So if Monica's not around,
I'm not good enough to raise Emma?
No,that is not what we're saying.
Yeah,he's lying. He looked down.
Well,what's wrong with me? Am I incompetent?
Because I managed to survive
whatever it is that killed the three of you!
You're taking this the wrong way.
We think you are going to be a wonderful parent.
It's just.. You're more the,you know,fun parent.
Yeah,and we wanna make sure that Emma
also has someone like Monica..
who's more of a disciplinarian.
Someone who can be firm and strict.
That's not how you see me,is it?
No,you're all about the fun.
I may not know a lot about babies,
but do you really think I'm not capable?
No. You both are equally capable.
It's just you're strongest when you're together.
Okay. So if we both had Emma,
and I died..
she'd have to give her up.
Sure. Monica would have to give her up.
I lie better than that,right?
Let me just get this straight.
So my two friends die,I get Emma.
Then my wife dies. Then Emma,
the one tiny ray of hope left in my life..
gets taken away from me?
There's your movie.
Hey,there you are.
You disappeared after dinner.
Did somebody miss me?
Was there a child to raise poorly?
Ross and Rachel don't know what they're saying.
It's not like they're so responsible.
Emma is a product of a bottle of merlot
and a fiveyearold condom.
No,but they're right.
I'm not a strong father figure,and I never will be.
No,you learn these things.
You grow into it.
Yeah,but it's not who I am.
Everything they said
is exactly why I was worried about having a kid.
And it's true.
And look,everybody knows it.
I don't know it.
I wanna have a kid with you because
I think you'll be an amazing dad.
At the fun parts and at the hard parts.
Well,can you picture me saying,
"Go to your room,you're grounded"?
Can you hear me say,"You're grounded"?
You said that to me last week.
How hard is it?
"No shoes on the furniture!"
The producer from Days left a message
asking why I wasn't at the parade.
They said everybody's really pissed off at me.
And they all got to meet Santa!
It's okay. I thought of the perfect lie for you.
It's simple. It's easy to remember,
and it doesn't invite a lot of questions.
You weren't at the parade
because you had a family emergency.
I like that! Yeah!
I wasn't at the parade
because I had a family emergency.
What happened?
 My sister's raccoon came..  No,nothing with a raccoon!
 Wait,what are you doing?  Setting the table.
We thought it might be nice to use the fancy china
for dessert too.
How nice. Maybe later we can
all go blow our noses on my wedding dress.
Hey,dude,you okay?
Sorry about before.
That's okay. You're totally right.
I don't know anything about disciplining a child.
But it did hurt my feelings,
and I want you to know that if I die..
you don't get Joey.
In case you hadn't noticed,
I'm not talking to you.
You know,this is just.. This is classic Rachel.
Oh,yeah,right. Remember in high school
when I died and didn't give you my baby?
This might be my one chance to have a child,Rachel.
I mean,you know that I have been so busy focusing on my career..
 What career?  I'm a decorator.
You decorate Dad's office
and now you're a decorator?
Okay,I went to the zoo yesterday,
now I'm a koala bear.
Why can't you ever be supportive?
You wanna talk supportive?
You didn't come and visit me
when I was in the hospital having the baby!
You didn't come see me in the hospital
when I was getting my lips done!
I did the first time.
You know what? You wanna know
why I am not giving Emily to you?
 Emma.  Whose side are you on?!
I'm not giving you Emma
because you can't handle
the responsibility of a child.
Well,how hard could it be? You do it.
You wanna know why you don't want me to have the baby?
Because you don't want me to be happy.
You have always been jealous of me.
Jealous of what?
Of your lack of responsibility? Your immaturity?
Your total disregard for other people's feelings?
To name a few.
You know, you've always been like this.
You had to have everything,
and I couldn't have anything.
Like in junior high,when you stole Timmy from me.
I mean,do you even realize how much that hurt me?
Timmy was my boyfriend,
and you made out with him!
Come on,that was 20 years ago.
Get over it.
I cannot believe that I invited you here today!
Yeah,well,you know what I cannot believe?
That my socalled sister..
gets a 30 percent discount from Ralph Lauren,
and I still have to pay retail?
It's 45.
You bitch.
You just think you're so perfect..
with your new baby and your small apartment.
Well,let me tell you something.
Your baby isn't even that cute.
Too far,Amy. Too far.
 You take that back.  No.
Take it back!
No. What are you gonna do? Make me?
Hey,man,I work out!
 So do I.  I do Pilates.
 I do yoga.  Bring it on!
Put the plates in the boxes! Put the plates in the boxes!
 Did you just push me?  Yeah,I think I did.
All right,that's it.
Forget the bubble wrap! There isn't time!
Frizzy,frizzy,frizzy!
Oh my god, Shouldn't we stop this?
Are you out of your mind?
Let's throw some JellO on them!
Gross!
All right,that is it!
This is our apartment,and you cannot behave this way!
If you can't act your age,
you shouldn't be here at all.
Those plates may not be
as nice as the pretty pink ones that I picked out..
but they're important to Monica.
And I want you to apologize to her,now.
 I'm sorry.  Mon,I'm so sorry.
Okay. That's better.
Now,I want you to apologize to each other and mean it.
 Sorry.  Sorry.
By the way,that fight was totally arousing.
Dude,well done.
If I die and Rachel dies and Monica dies,
you can totally take care of Emma.
Yeah? Well,thanks.
So.. So now do I get Joey?
Okay. But you should know he eats a lot
and shoves pennies up his nose.
Are you okay,Mon?
I mean,these things happen.
I mean,it's just a plate.
It's not like somebody died.
It's all right. You can mourn.
Thank you. It was so beautiful!
I'm gonna go to Joey's and get the pies.
Actually,not pies. It's just pie.
I don't care.
Oh,my God,I've lost the will to scold.
Look,Amy..
we got a little..
a little outofcontrol over there.
And I'm sorry.
You're my sister..
and if it really means that much to you..
So you're gonna give me the baby?
No,I was..
I was gonna let you use my Ralph Lauren discount.
You are not gonna regret this.
She needs changing.
No,no,no. I'll get her.
I am super confident,totally responsible
and fourth in line to raise Emma.
I'll be right there,Emma!
Just let me get my trusty diaper bag here.
Well,what do you know? I guess I'll be the one who dies first.
Does Monica know about you breaking her plates yet?
Nope.
 Broke them all,huh?  Yep.
 You gonna tell her?  Nope.
Hey. So I'm gonna put the plates back.
I think you're right.
We shouldn't use these plates for a long time.
Like only if the queen comes?
Maybe not even then.
Hey. I did it.
I told my producer
I had a family emergency.
He totally bought it.
Thanks for teaching me how to lie, Phebs
No problem. Next week,stealing.
Bye,plates.
You told her you broke all the plates?
What?! Something happened with the plates?
Yeah,this raccoon came in..
This kitty is Mittens. This one is Fitzhugh.
And this little guy in the cat condo is Jinkies.
That's a lot of cats,Jo Lynn.
Single,are you?
Chandler Bing.
How come you're answering your own phone?
Where's your crazy assistant?
What's up,Joe?
Ok, What have we always wanted to do together?
Braid each other's hair and ride horseback on the beach?
No. No. No. When you get home tomorrow night..
you and I are gonna be at the WizardsKnicks game,
courtside!
 Courtside? Oh,my God!  Yeah!
Maybe Michael Jordan will dive for the ball
and break my jaw with his knee!
That is so cool. I'll let Monica know.
 Hello?  Joey just called.
He's got courtside
Knicks tickets for him and me tomorrow night.
Really?
But tomorrow night's the only night
I get off from the restaurant.
If you go to the game,
we won't have a night together for another week.
But honey,it's courtside!
The cheerleaders will be right in..
That's not the way to convince you.
I don't wanna be one of those wives that says:
"You can't go to the game. You have to spend time with me."
So if you could just realize it on your own..
I know. You're right.
I wanna see you too.
I gotta figure out a way to tell Joey.
He's looking forward to this.
Tell him you haven't seen your wife in a long time.
Tell him that having a longdistance relationship
is really difficult.
Tell him that what little time we have together
is precious.
I'll think of something.
Friends S09E09 The One With Rachel's Phone Number
You look..
I mean,it's just.. That dress..
Well,I hope the ends of these sentences are good.
They're good. It's just been a while since
I've seen you like this.
You clean up good.
Really? Well,thank you.
Okay,stop looking at me like that.
Last time that happened,that happened.
Right,right.
So are you excited about your first night away from Emma?
Yeah,yeah. Phoebe and l are gonna have so much fun.
 Thank you for watching the baby.  It's fine.
Actually,I invited Mike over.
 Phoebe's Mike?  Yeah.
 I didn't know you hung out.  We don't..
but I'd like to get to know him.
Maybe have a little dinner,drinks,conversation.
That's so cute. Ross and Mike's first date.
Will that be awkward? What are you gonna talk about?
I don't know. But you know,
we have a lot in common,you know?
He plays piano. I played keyboards in college.
He's been divorced. I have some experience in that area.
 Yeah?  Hi!
Girl's night out indeed.
So I think Emma is probably down for the night..
but if you need anything..
Rach, We'll be fine.
 You go have fun.  Okay,you too.
 Thanks.  And I hope you score.
 Okay. Bye.  Bye.
So,welcome.
 I got beer.  I got bottled breast milk.
 Why don't we start with the beer.  Okay.
 So Phoebe tells me you play piano.  Yeah.
You know,I used to play keyboards in college.
Do you have one here?
No.
Okay.
You know,I'm divorced.
Phoebe.. Phoebe says you're.. You've been divorced?
Yeah,yeah.
Yeah,I'm sorry. I don't really like to talk about it.
That's okay. We'll talk about something else.
 So you're a paleontologist,right?  Yeah.
My cousin's a paleontologist.
Well,he and I would probably have a lot to talk about.
 Welcome home.  Well,look at you.
Yeah. What do you think?
Well,it looks great. It's just..
I'm wearing the same thing underneath,so..
You see what I mean?
Hey! How come your door's locked?
 Just a second!  No,no,no!
Joey can't know I'm here.
Why not?
Because I didn't know how to tell him that
I couldn't go to the Knicks game..
so I told him I had to stay in Tulsa.
So you lied to him?
It's always better to lie than to have the complicated discussion.
Except with you.
Hey,open the door! What's going on?
 What are you..?  Hi.
Why are you dressed like that?
Because Chandler's gonna be home in a couple of days..
so I thought I would just,
you know,practice the art of seduction.
I thought I heard a man's voice before.
No,I was just doing Chandler's side of the conversation.
You know,like,
"Hi,how do I look?"
"Really sexy. Could I be any more turned on?"
You know?
Okay. Wait a minute.
Why are there two glasses of wine out?
Because one of them is for you!
Cheers! Okay,byebye.
You know,it's funny.
I've been practicing the art of seduction myself.
 You might wanna keep practicing.  Yeah.
 It's Joey.  What?
 Hey,Joe.  Dude,come home!
 What? Why?  Come home!
Look,I can't. What's going on?
I don't know how to tell you this,
but I think Monica's cheating on you!
I told you,you shouldn't have married
someone hotter than you!
If you can't deal with this,
then I'm gonna.
 No!  I just heard him!
Can you hear him now?
No. All right,I'm going in.
 No,wait!  I heard him again!
All right,just stay there.
I'm coming home.
Ok, great, I'll see you when you get here.
I'll wait out in the hall in case he comes out.
Is that really necessary?
Absolutely. You'd do it for me.
Not that you ever have to,
because I know how to keep my women satisfied.
Shouldn't the pizza be here by now?
I mean,they said 30 minutes or less.
Well,how long has it been?
Eleven minutes.
And now 12.
 So you like the beer?  I do. I do.
Although,it's actually a lager.
What's the difference between beer and lager?
I don't know.
We could look it up.
Things are about to get wild.
Oh,God,remember the girls' nights we used to have..
sitting around talking about you and Ross?
Oh,God! It seems like forever ago.
I know.
So,what's going on with you and Ross?
Well,I don't know.
I mean,for a long time,nothing.
But you know,actually,right before you picked me up..
Ross and I had a little thing.
Oh,my God! I love things!
What happened?
Well,first he told me he liked how I looked.
And then we had a little..
eye contact.
Eye contact?
I hope you were using protection.
Excuse me,
these are from the two gentlemen at the end of the bar.
Should we send them something back?
Let's send them mashed potatoes!
No,wait! Don't do that!
That'll make them think they can come over.
So,what if they do?
We're not here to meet guys.
You have a boyfriend. I have a baby and a Ross.
Yeah,but nothing has to happen.
We're just having fun.
You know,not everything has to go as far as eye contact.
Chandler,you have to tell Joey
you're not in Tulsa.
Isn't it better for him to think you're cheating on me..
than for him to think I'm cheating on him?
I heard it.
I don't want him to think I'm having an affair.
All right,I've got a plan.
I'll go down the fire escape..
Because all good plans start with,
"I'll go down the fire escape."
Hear me out,woman!
I'll go down the fire escape and I'll wait for a while.
Then when I come up the stairs
it'll be like I just got back from Tulsa.
Joey and I will come in and see
that there's no guy in here.
Aren't you afraid that Joey's gonna figure all this out?
I heard it.
I'm just gonna wait for a little while.
The scary pigeon's back?
It's huge.
Oh, my god. I can't believe you live in that building.
My grandmother lives in that building!
Ida Greene? No sense of personal space..
kind of smells like chicken,looks like a potato.
"Spuds" is your grandmother?
That's my bubbe!
So we're on our way to a couple of parties.
Maybe we could get your numbers
and call if we find something fun?
I'm sorry,
we weren't really looking for anything
to happen with you guys.
I have a boyfriend.
 All right.  It's no big deal.
So she has a boyfriend. What is your situation?
Well,it's complicated. I don't actually have a boyfriend,but..
Then can I have your number?
I'm sorry,no.
Okay.
Oh,sure!
Oh,my God,you're giving your real number!
Okay,thanks. I'll give you a call later tonight.
 Great.  Bye.
Bye.
So that's great.
You,Bill,Ross and Emma
are gonna be so happy together.
What were you thinking?
I don't know. He was cute,
and he liked me. It was an impulse.
But what about Ross? What about your moment?
 Don't you wanna talk to him?  No.
No,because I know exactly
how the conversation's gonna go.
"Hey,Ross,you know,
I think we had a moment before."
"Yeah. Me too."
"Well,but I'm not sure
I really want to do anything about it."
"Yeah. Me neither."
"Should we just live together..
and not tell each other how we're feeling?"
"Yeah,that works for me."
Yeah,I see what you mean.
By the way,nice Ross imitation.
Your Rachel wasn't whiny enough.
 Well.. Hey!  Better.
The point is maybe I should just stop waiting around
for moments with Ross.
You know? I should just move on with my life.
So really,you're moving on from Ross?
I don't know. Do I have to decide right now?
You kind of just did.
That guy is gonna call you tonight.
Ross will pick up the phone,
and that's a pretty clear message.
Oh,my God,Ross!
Ross is gonna pick up the phone.
I have to get my number back.
Oh,my God,he's gone!
"Oh,I have to get my number back!
Oh,my God! He's gone!" Dead on.
 You know,I'm gonna take off.  So soon?
 Yeah.  Okay.
Well,thanks.. Thanks for the beer.
You mean lager?
Yeah. Good times.
 Hello?  Hey,Mike,it's me.
Listen,is.. Is Ross near you?
No,I just left.
Well,you have to go back in.
What? Go back? To the land where time stands still?
I'm so sorry,honey,but..
Okay,Rachel gave this guy her number..
and she doesn't want Ross to answer the phone.
So you have to intercept all his calls.
I can't do that!
 He says he can't do that.  Give me the phone.
Hi,Mike. Hi,listen,
I know that this is a lot to ask,
but you know what? If you do this,
Phoebe will do anything you want.
Seriously,I'm talking dirty stuff.
Hello?
Hi,I'm sorry about her.
But actually,she wasn't wrong about the dirty stuff.
All right,I'll do it.
But really,how much dirtier can it get?
Oh,Mike.
Bye.
Hey,buddy.
 Can I come back in?  Why?
Well,I was just thinking about
how much more we have to talk about.
But you left.
That didn't take long.
I thought you said Tulsa was,like,a threehour flight?
Well,you're forgetting about the time difference.
Chandler,you're home!
That's right! Your husband's home!
So now the sex can stop!
What are you saying?
Joey said you're here with another man!
There's no man in here!
How dare you accuse me of that!
All right. Then maybe you won't mind
if me and my friend take a look around.
What's he doing?
I arranged some pillows on the bed to look like a guy.
Bedroom's clear.
Although you might need some new pillows.
All right,well,I'll check the guest room.
Why do I smell men's cologne?
I think that's you.
Oh,yeah.
I rubbed a magazine on myself earlier.
There's nobody here,Joe.
I guess not.
I can't believe you thought I was cheating.
You owe me an apology.
You're right. Monica, I'm so sorry.
It's an honest mistake.
It could happen to anybody. See you.
Wait a minute,wait a minute.
If you just got back from Tulsa,
how did your suitcase beat you here?
I climbed down the fire escape,
and you can't put that in the closet?
So,with the exception of the fermentation process..
beer and ale are basically the same thing.
Fascinating,isn't it?
Maybe you should look up "fascinating."
I'll get it!
Hello? Ross' place. Mike speaking.
It's for you.
I don't understand what just happened here.
What's going on?
I'm sorry.
I told you I was in Tulsa because
I wanted to spend the night with Monica..
and I didn't know.. I didn't think you'd understand.
You think I'm too dumb to understand
a husband needs to be with his wife?
You think I'm,like..
 Joey?  Yeah.
I don't know what to say.
We shouldn't have lied to you.
I feel so bad.
Is there anything I can do to make it up to you?
You could go to the game with me.
Even though you said you couldn't.
But then you lied to me and tricked me
and gave me a bump on the head.
I'm sorry,that's the one thing I can't do.
I promised I'd be with Monica.
All right.
 You can go.  What?
You should go to the game.
It's okay. I want you to.
Really? You gonna be okay?
Yeah,I'll be fine.
You know,maybe I'll stay here
and practice the art of seduction.
You're gonna put sweats on and clean, aren't you?
It's gonna be so hot!
 Bye.  Bye.
Thanks.
Here's your ticket.
Thanks. Hey,listen..
I'm never gonna lie to you again,okay?
And I want you to know
that nobody thinks you're stupid.
Thanks,man.
Where you going?
Game's tomorrow night,Joe.
So glad you're back!
So,what did you guys do?
You know,we just drank some beer.
Mike played with the boundaries of normal social conduct.
It's true,I did.
 Well,goodbye.  Okay.
Bye. That was fun,Phoebe.
I know. It was fun.
See you,guys.
Lock the door! Lock the door,seriously.
Shoot,I forgot to pay Phoebe for the drinks.
Wait,wait. Wait,sorry.
Did he call? Did that guy call?
No,just his mom.
Around 8:30?
 Yeah.  Then again at 9:00?
Hello?
No,she's not here right now. Can I take a message?
Bill from the bar?
Okay,Bill from the bar,
I'll make sure she gets your number.
So.. So how was it?
Did you guys..? You guys have a good time?
We had so much fun. It felt so good to be out.
Rach?
Yeah?
Never mind.
 Hey,you guys.  Hey!
I'll be right back. I gotta go to the bathroom.
Stout. That's a kind of beer.
He sprang to his sleigh to his team gave a whistle
And away they all flew Like the down of a thistle
But I heard him exclaim Ere he drove out of sight
"Merry Christmas to all
And to all a good night."
Wow! That was great!
You really wrote that?
Uhhuh
Say goodbye,elves. I'm off to Tulsa.
I can't believe you won't be here for Christmas.
You're really not coming back?
We have this paperwork
that needs to be filed by the end of the year.
If I don't get it done,I'll be fired.
It's so unfair.
You don't even like your job.
So. Who does?
 I like my job.  I love my job.
I can't wait to go back to work.
I can't get enough dinosaurs.
I'm sorry I won't be here.
It's hard enough not seeing you during the week..
but for Christmas..
If this is what you have to do,I understand.
Thanks.
I'll see you New Year's Day.
You're not gonna be here New Year's Eve?
 Did I not mention that?  No.
And to all a good night!
Friends S09E10 The One With Christmas In Tulsa
All right,everybody. I know it is Christmas Eve..
and you'd rather be with family,
but there is no call for writing..
"Screw you,Mr. Bing"
on the back of my chair.
By the way,you can all call me Chandler.
 Hey.  Hey. Where you been?
I was checking out
that insurance company's Christmas party on three.
It was really beautiful.
They have decorations and this huge tree.
And I just thought,to hell with them,
we have to work.
So I stole their ham.
Hear that? You may not be with your families..
but at least it's gonna smell like ham in here.
My kid's in a play right now.
You know what? I know what will cheer you up.
I had a talk with the boys in New York.
I told them about all your hard work you've been doing.
and that a little Christmas bonus may be in order.
"A donation has been made in your name
to the New York City Ballet."
Well,that's like money in your pocket.
All right,you want me to say it?
This sucks.
Being here sucks. This work sucks!
Now it feels like Christmas.
I'm sorry.
At least you get to go home
and be with your families tonight.
I have to go to an empty hotel room
and lay down.. on a very questionable bedspread.
Then tomorrow morning,
you get to have Christmas in your own houses.
Which,by the way,none of you have invited me to.
 You can come to my house.  No,thanks.
 It was a nice pep talk.  Thanks.
I'm actually thinking about becoming a motivational speaker.
So if you were home right now,
what would you be doing?
Typical Christmassy stuff,you know.
Our holidays are pretty traditional.
So here's a very special holiday song..
that I wrote for some very important people to me.
Went to the store Sat on Santa's lap
Asked him to bring my friends all kinds of crap
Said all you need is To write them a song
Now you haven't heard it yet So don't try to sing along
No,don't sing along
Monica,Monica Have a happy Hannukah
Saw Santa Claus
He said hello to Ross
And please tell Joey
Christmas will be snowy
And Rachel and Chandler
Happy holidays,everybody.
Phoebe,look in the kitchen.
I'll look in the back closet.
I can save you time,ladies.
I'm right here.
Yeah. Chandler,why don't you take a walk.
This doesn't concern you.
We are looking for our Christmas presents from Monica.
What? That's terrible.
No,no. We do it every year.
Well,that makes it not terrible.
No. Yeah,we never find them.
She's always bested us,that wily..
minx.
Don't worry. We're gonna search here for an hour..
and then we'll go to Joey's and search. Okay?
No,not okay.
You can't look for Monica's presents.
 No,we have to.  No,you don't have to.
And you can't,because I live here too.
 Well,then you should look with us.  Why?
Chandler, Aren't you worried about
what to get Monica for Christmas?
No,I have a great idea for a present for her.
That's it? "A great idea"?
That's not enough.
What if she gets you a great present..
two medium presents and lots of little presents..
and you got her one great present?
That's gonna make her feel bad.
Why would you do that to her, Chandler?
Why? Why?
If I helped,we could find them faster!
Right.
We have a live one!
It's a Macy's bag!
Who's it for?
"Dear Losers: Do you really think
I'd hide presents under the couch?
P.S. Chandler,
I knew they'd break you."
Rach,these are for you.
Wiper blades. I don't even have a car.
No,
but with this newcar smell,
you'll think you do.
Okay,Phoebe,your turn.
Toilet seat covers!
Is that what you were doing
while I was getting gas?
You guys.
And for Ross,Mr. Sweet Tooth.
 You got me a cola drink?  And.. a lemonlime!
Well,this.. This is too much.
I feel like I should get you another sweater.
And last but not least..
They're ribbed,for your pleasure.
Well,hey,Ben?
What if the Holiday Armadillo told you
all about the Festival of Lights?
Cool!
Come on,Ben.
Years and years ago,
there were these people called the Maccabees!
Merry Christmas!
Santa!
What are you doing here,Santa?
Well,I'm here to see my old buddy Ben.
What are you doing here..
weird turtleman?
I'm the Holiday Armadillo,your partJewish friend.
You sent me here to give Ben some presents.
Remember?
What?
Ben,why don't you open some more presents.
Santa,the armadillo and I will have a talk in the kitchen.
There's a sentence I never thought I'd say.
What are you doing?
You called and said
you had trouble finding a Santa costume..
so I borrowed one from a guy at work.
Thank you,but you gotta leave.
 Why?  Because..
I'm finally getting him excited about Hanukkah.
And you're wrecking it.
But I didn't get to
shake my belly like a bowl full of jelly.
I'm sorry,Chandler,
but this is really important to me.
Okay,fine. I'll give the suit back.
Hey,you think you can keep it another night?
Santa? Really?
Yeah,is that okay?
Did your dad ever dress up like Santa?
 No.  Then it's okay!
You know what,everybody?
Go home. You should be with your families.
It's bad enough we're working New Year's Eve.
Did I not tell anyone about New Year's Eve?
All right,look,go.
Go home,okay? Merry Christmas.
 Merry Christmas.  Peace on earth.
Bye.
Good. Godspeed,good people.
You're not gonna go?
No. I couldn't leave you alone.
Thanks.
Besides,I can't leave until
that Christmas party downstairs clears out.
There are some pissedoff insurance people
looking for that ham.
Chandler Bing.
Hi,honey. We're all here.
We want to wish you a merry Christmas.
 Merry Christmas!  Merry Christmas!
Merry Christmas. I miss you guys.
So is it horrible? Is everybody working really hard?
Well,no,it's just me and Wendy.
Wendy? That sounds like a girl's name.
It is. Did I not tell you about her?
About the time you told me about New Year's Eve.
 Where's everybody else?  I sent them home.
You are such a good boss. Is she pretty?
Answer faster. Answer faster.
I don't know.
Answer better. Answer better.
I don't think of her that way.
I mean,she's a colleague.
What does she do there?
She's regional vice president.
 She's just below me.  She did what?
Below me.
Wait,is Wendy the
runnerup Miss Oklahoma?
What?!
Well,she didn't win.
All right,maybe I should let you..
and the second prettiest girl in Oklahoma
get back to work.
Second prettiest that year.
Of all the girls in Oklahoma,she's probably..
Chandler,stop talking.
Honey,there's really nothing to worry about.
 Okay.  I'm serious.
Okay.
 Merry Christmas.  Merry Christmas.
 Merry Christmas,you guys.  Merry Christmas.
 The wife says hi.  Fun conversation?
Well,she's just got this weird idea that..
because you and I are alone
something's gonna happen.
Really?
Would that be so terrible?
This is probably the wrong thing to be worrying about..
but you're getting ham on my only tie.
 Back off,missy!  Missy?
I don't know.
I'm not used to girls making passes at me.
Wait a minute. Am I sexy in Oklahoma?
 You are to me.  No. No. No!
Look,I'm married.
So? I'm married.
I'm happily married.
What's that like?
Right. So I'm sorry,but..
Seriously? Happily married?
So that phone call before,that was happy?
Well,look,it's not easy to spend this much time apart.
She's entitled to be a little paranoid.
Or,in this case,right on the money.
You know,she's amazing and beautiful and smart.
And if she were here right now,
she'd kick your ass.
Look,you're a really nice person,
hamstealing and adultery aside.
But what I have with my wife is pretty great.
So nothing's ever gonna happen between us.
Okay,let me ask you something.
If what you and your wife have is so great..
then why are you spending Christmas with me?
You were the most beautiful woman in the room tonight.
 Really?  Are you kidding?
You're the most beautiful woman in most rooms.
What's going on? You and I just made out.
 You and I are making out?  Well,not anymore.
But we don't do that.
I know. I just thought it would be fun.
How drunk are you?
Drunk enough that I wanna do this.
Not so drunk that you should feel
guilty about taking advantage.
That's a perfect amount.
 You know what's weird?  What?
 This doesn't feel weird.  I know.
You're a really good kisser.
Well,I have kissed over four women.
 You wanna get under the covers?  Okay.
Wow,you are really fast.
It bodes well for me that speed impresses you.
 We're gonna see each other naked.  Yep.
 You want to do it at the same time?  Count of three?
 One.  Two.
Three.
Well,I think it's safe to say that
our friendship is effectively ruined.
We weren't that close anyway.
Are you really gonna go out with that nurseman?
Well,you and I are just goofing around.
I thought,why not just goof around with him?
I don't know if you've ever looked up the term
"goofing around" in the dictionary.
Well,I have.
And the technical definition is two friends..
who care a lot about each other and have amazing sex..
and just want to spend more time together.
If you have this newfangled dictionary
that gets you mad at me..
then we have to,you know,
get you my original dictionary.
I am so bad at this.
I think you're better than you think you are.
Really? Okay. So if..?
Know when to stop.
I sensed that I should stop.
 So we're okay?  Yeah.
 Don't do the dance.  Right.
I can't get married
without something old,something new..
something borrowed,something blue.
Okay,okay. Okay.
Here's something blue and new.
You are so efficient. I love you.
 Let's go.  No,no,wait!
We need something old.
Okay. I have a condom in my wallet
that I've had since I was 12.
That'll work!
I don't think so.
Okay. Now we just need something borrowed.
 Here,just take this.  That's stealing.
We'll bring it back. Just put it under your dress.
Okay,one thing at a time.
Listen..
I've been thinking.
It's not fair for me to ask you
to spend all of your money on our wedding.
I mean,you work.. You work really hard for that.
Well,you work for that.
Look,I've thought about it too. And..
I'm sorry.
I think we should spend all of the money on the wedding.
You do?
Yeah. I'm putting my foot down.
Yeah,look,when I proposed..
I told you that I would do anything to make you happy.
And if having the perfect wedding
makes you happy,then..
Then that's what we're gonna do.
You are so sweet.
But wait. What about our..?
What about the future and stuff?
Forget about the future and stuff.
So we only have two kids.
You know,we'll pick our favorite,
and that one will get to go to college.
 You've thought about that?  Yeah.
How many kids were we gonna have?
Four. A boy,twin girls..
and another boy.
 What else did you think about?  Well..
stuff like where we'd live,you know.
Like a small place outside the city
where our kids could ride bikes and stuff.
And we could have a cat that had a bell on its collar..
and we could hear it every time
it ran through the little kitty door.
We'd have an apartment over the garage
where Joey could grow old.
You know what?
I don't.. I don't want a big,fancy wedding.
 Sure you do.  No.
I want everything that you've just said.
I want a marriage.
You sure?
 I love you so much.  I love you.
I love it!
Really? You're not gonna return it?
Well,not this second.
Hey,look,you guys. It's snowing!
 Wow,it's so beautiful.  Wow,it really is.
Wendy's a fatgirl name.
Aren't we done with that?
Okay,fine. Fine. Let's talk about snow.
Do you think it's snowing in Tulsa
where my husband's having sex on a copier?
 Hey.  Oh,my God.
Look at that. That's a Christmas miracle!
What are you doing here?
I wanted to be with you.
I missed you so much.
 Hey,hey. Who'd you miss the most?  Monica.
Gotcha.
I never want to leave you again.
I thought if you left,you'd get fired.
Turns out they can't fire me.
Because I quit.
 What?  What? You..? You really quit your job?
Yeah. It was a stupid job,
and I could not stand leaving you.
Why should I be the only one
who doesn't do what he really wants to do?
Well,what do you really wanna do?
I have not thought this through.
Oh,my God.
I know. I should've talked to you first about it.
No,I think that this is what you wanna do.
I think it's great!
Thanks.
Chandler,your being here
is the best Christmas present I could ever imagine.
 Now give me my real gift.  Yeah.
 Thank you.  Here,pass those around.
"A donation has been made in your name
to the New York City Ballet."
How did you know?
What? Are you kidding?
I can't return this.
It's time we started thinking about other people.
And besides,this gift still says,
"I love you guys."
Mine says,"To Lillian Myers."
I don't have a job.
Actuary? No.
Bookkeeper? No.
Topless dancer?
Hey,you know what I just realized?
You are the sole wage earner.
You are the head of the household.
I don't do anything. I'm a kept man!
You are.
Honey,here's 20 bucks.
Go buy yourself something pretty
while I'm at work tomorrow.
Good morning,tiger.
I'm making you a big breakfast,
so you can keep up your strength for tonight.
You're gonna get me good and pregnant.
I've got nowhere to go this morning. I'm unemployed.
I don't know what I'm gonna do with my life.
Well,I just lost my erection.
No,I mean,what am I supposed to do with myself?
You're supposed to find your passion in life.
You can be whatever you want to be now.
It's exciting.
Yeah,but it's all so overwhelming.
I don't know where to start.
Wait a second. I can help you with this.
You just need to be organized.
We can make a list of your qualifications..
and categorize jobs by industry.
There could be folders and files..
Hey,this is where your hyperorganized
painintheass stuff pays off.
I know!
My erection is back!
Friends S09E11 The One Where Rachael Goes Back to Work
Thank you.
Phoebe,have you ever been
bitten by a hungry Italian?
I'm sorry. It's just,I'm a little short on cash.
If you want,I could loan you some money.
Oh,no. no. I learned
never to borrow money from friends.
That's why Richard Dreyfuss
and I don't speak anymore.
Hey,how about this?
Wanna be an extra on my show?
 You could do that?  Yeah
The pay's pretty good,
and you could do it for as long as you need.
Oh,my God. I'm gonna be on TV!
Okay,now..
I gotta tell you,being on TV isn't
as glamorous and exciting as you think.
Really?
No,it is awesomer.
Hey,guys.
Why are you all dressed up?
Rach and I are bringing Emma to Ralph Lauren today
to introduce her to everyone.
Doesn't she look cute?
She sure does.
Why does she have a
pink bow taped to her head?
Because if one more person says,
"What a cute little boy"..
I'm gonna whip them with a car antenna.
I think she's gonna be the hit of the office.
Yeah,she's gonna be hotter than
peasant blouses and Aline skirts.
Can I get a blue bow?
Okay. I have looked through a bunch of career guides..
photocopied and highlighted key passages..
and put them into alphabetical folders,
so you can make an informed decision.
How long was I in there?
Okay,let's start with the A's. Advertising.
Wait. Advertising,that's a great idea.
Don't you wanna look through the rest?
I don't think I have to hear the rest.
Advertising makes perfect sense.
Sorry you had to waste all this time.
You call eight hours alone
with my label maker wasted time?
Now I'll get to use my shredder!
I mean,I could write slogans.
How hard could it be,right?
"Cheese. It's milk that you chew."
"Crackers. Because your cheese needs a buddy."
"A grape. Because who can get a watermelon in your mouth?"
I got one.
"Socks.
Because your family's feet deserve the best."
Honey,leave it to the pros.
I actually know someone in advertising.
I grew up with a guy
who is a vice president at a big agency.
Maybe I can get him to meet you.
Give me the phone.
"The phone. Bringing you closer to people who have phones."
"Marriage. It's not for everybody."
That went well.
Almost everybody knew that she was a girl.
Yeah,after you punched that one guy who got it wrong,
word spread.
I'm just gonna go in my office and pick up some stuff.
 Who the hell are you?  Who the hell are you?
I'm the hell person whose office this is.
Good one,Rach.
I'm Gavin Mitchell,
the person who's taking over your job.
Excuse me?
Your baby's so cute.
But why would you
put a pink bow on a boy?
Hey,Joey. Look at me.
I'm a nurse.
Yes,you are.
I think it might be time for my sponge bath.
Sorry,I'm just so used to hitting on the extras.
So are you excited about your scene?
Yeah,but I'm a little nervous.
Relax. Don't be. You will be fine.
They'll probably just make you stand in the background.
OK. OK. OK
You. Here,come here. Here.  OK
Take this tray,stand on this yellow mark.
You're gonna move on "action."
Walk over to the operating table,stop on the blue mark
and put the tray down.
Don't walk too fast.
But don't dawdle.
Okay. Now,what?
And,action!
Cut! Cut.
I'm sorry. I'm just a little nervous.
Well,don't be.
Okay,that helps.
And,action!
Cut!
You know what? Don't worry about it,Phoebe.
It usually takes me three takes too.
All right,eight.
And,action!
So do you have any other questions about advertising?
No. But let me show you what I can do.
"Bagels and doughnuts.
Round food for every mood."
Monica warned me you might do that.
I think we might have something for you at the agency.
Really? That's great.
It's an unpaid internship.
That's funny. When you said "unpaid,"
it sounded like you said "unpaid."
Come on,now. Monica has a good job.
It's not like you have a family to support.
Actually,we're trying.
I don't think Monica is gonna want to postpone it.
We're supposed to have sex tonight.
Actually,she's probably at home,
naked right now.
I tend to keep talking till somebody stops me.
 I can just picture her on the bed.  Stop!
OK.
Wait a minute.
What do you mean you're taking over my job?
While you were on your baby vacation,
I was doing your job.
A vacation? My idea of a vacation does not involve..
something sucking on my nipples until they are raw.
Clearly,you've never been to Sandals Paradise lsland.
All right. Don't get too comfortable there,
because I'm back in two weeks.
I want everything back the way it was.
I can't say I care too much
for the way you've rearranged my office.
I can't say I care too much for that smell you've brought in.
Excuse me?
Rach,we have a code brown situation.
Honey,could you please take care of it for me?
All right,but you're gonna have to do one sometime.
Let me just get this straight.
So I go have a baby,
and they send some guy in to do my job?
Well,there was talk of shutting down Ralph Lauren altogether.
Okay. Right. You're very cheeky for a temp.
I'm not a temp.
I was transferred here from another department.
And what department was that? The jerk department?
They didn't tell me about your quick wit.
Well,did they mention
that I'm rubber and you're glue?
Gavin,Ralph loved your ideas.
Hi,Mr. Zelner.
Rachel. I see you've met Gavin.
When you left us,
we weren't sure what we were gonna do.
But then,Gavin to the rescue. Super Gavin.
Well,that's great. that's great.
So now,Super Gavin,when I come back..
where do you plan on flying off to?
That's up to Mr. Zelner.
I'm sure he'll make the right decision.
Super asskissing power.
Incidentally,when are you coming back?
Today.
You said two weeks.
No,I said today.
See,for a superhero,
not so much with the listening.
So,what'd he say?
He can be a little rough around the edges..
so I'm gonna replace a word
he used a lot with the word "puppy."
So he said,"If your puppy friend
doesn't get her puppy act together..
I am gonna fire her motherpuppy ass."
I'm sorry. I can't do this.
I'm just not an actor.
That's right. You're not. You're a nurse.
 You're Nurse With Tray.  No,Joey..
No, no. Nurse With Tray doesn't know Joey.
She has no time for friends.
She gets in that operating room
and she carries that tray to the doctor..
because if she doesn't,people die.
Who dies?
Man With Eye Patch!
Now,you get in there,and you do your job.
 Yes,doctor. OK
Okay,let's try this one more time.
Hang in there,Man With Eye Patch.
Your tray is coming.
And,action.
Yes,I did it! I nailed it!
What's next?
The rest of the scene.
Okay,from the top,people.
Listen,sudden change of plans.
My maternity leave just ended.
They said if I didn't come back today,
they'd fire me.
What? No,that's illegal.
I'll have the Labor Department here so fast,they won't..
All right,calm down,Norma Rae.
They didn't actually say that.
I'm just afraid if I don't come back now,
this guy will try and squeeze me out.
But what about Emma?
I mean,we don't have a nanny.
I know. We're just gonna have to figure out a plan tonight.
Can you please just take care of her for today?
Absolutely. Just give me your breasts,
and we'll be on our way.
Come on. I don't know what else to do.
Fine. Fine.
We'll have fun,won't we?
Yes,we will. Yes,we..
Ross.
You're pretty.
Whatever I decide to do,
I'm gonna be starting a new career from scratch.
It's gonna be a while before I make a living at it.
Maybe now's not the right time to be starting a family.
So you have to tell Monica
you don't want to have a baby right now?
Yeah.
Goodbye.
Okay,it's baby time. Pants off,Bing.
Didn't see you there,Geller.
Ross is here,so..
And I was really hoping that maybe I could hang out.
You know,what do you feel like doing?
Well,we're gonna have sex.
I don't feel like having sex.
Maybe.. I don't know.
Maybe we can watch a movie or something.
Let me put it this way:
We're having sex whether you're here or not.
Pants off,Bing.
All right. Now that I'm back,
why don't you just fill me in
on what you've been up to.
Well,I've changed your screen saver from that picture of NSYNC.
Hey,they were popular when I left.
Mostly I've just been working on
this big presentation for tomorrow.
I should be involved in that,so get me up to speed.
That'll take weeks.
Why don't you just let me take care of the presentation.
No. I see what you're doing here,all right?
Listen, this is my job,buddy.
I've had it for five years,and I know how it works.
 So why don't you just catch me up.  Fine.
Oh,God.
You've totally messed with the back support on my chair.
How do you fix this?
You've been here five years.
 You figure it out.  Fine,I will.
All right,fill me in.
Do you have a blue tie that would go with this?
Emma spit up on mine.
Yeah,but you have to give it back if I get a job.
Of course,by that time, future ties will be obsolete..
and we'll all be wearing silver jumpsuits.
Hey,good morning,lover.
I gotta say,after last night,
I'm a little weak in the knees.
Here's an idea. You walk into a room,
take a quick scan.
Sorry.
But I kind of have this feeling
that we may have made a baby last night.
Oh,God,I have to tell you something.
You're not pregnant.
What are you talking about?
Well,that thing that I have to do to make a baby?
I faked it.
What? You faked it?
You know what?
I don't need a tie.
I mean,it's better open collar,you know?
It's more casual.
Joey. Listen,I can't do this.
It doesn't make any sense.
Yesterday I was a nurse,and today I'm a waitress at a cafe?
Sometimes we use the same extras
for different parts. It's okay.
Well,it's not okay,
because I gave a very memorable performance as the nurse.
And now,suddenly,I'm the waitress?
That's gonna confuse my fans.
Well,maybe you are a nurse..
but you moonlight as a waitress.
Because I'm a single mother supporting my two children.
Nice.
Wait a minute.
Dr. Drake Ramoray
and I work at the same hospital.
Wouldn't I come say hi to him?
No. No,see,you and Drake are having a fight.
About what?
He slept with you..
And then never called you.
And I just wanted a new daddy for Davey and Becky.
Okay. Okay,from the top.
And,action.
So I'm surprised you agreed to have lunch with me.
I'm surprised too. But yet,here I am.
Cut! Cut!
What, what are you doing?
I'm very angry at him because he slept with me
and never called me back.
 Me too.  Me too!
Calm down. She means on the show.
We need some new extras around here.
Wow. You're here already.
Yes. Emma and I came in a little early
to do research on the presentation.
Actually,I made a few changes.
I think I'm caught up on everything.
So ask me anything.
 How do you fix the chair?  Except that!
Hello,Mr. Zelner.
We are all ready for our presentation this afternoon.
Good,because it's in 10 minutes.
What? I can't do that. I have the baby.
Ross is not gonna pick her up for an hour.
Then Gavin can give the presentation, ok?
We have to do it now.
Ralph needs to leave early today.
He's going helicopter shopping.
Well,there you go,you win. You win.
You get to do the presentation. You'll knock them dead.
No one will remember that I worked here,
and then Ralph will buy his helicopter..
and Super Gavin will just fly right alongside of him.
You can do the presentation.
No,I can't. I have a baby.
I'll watch her.
Why would you do that?
Because you worked really hard, and it's your job.
And you're a little crazy.
That's really nice.
I should tell you that
crying women make me very uncomfortable.
Well,you're not gonna like what's coming.
I'm sorry,I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
God.
Thank you. Thank you.
I'm really fine. Don't worry.
I'm great with children.
Gavin Mitchell. Pleased to meet you.
Please don't fire my friend.
Just let me talk to her.
Okay,but this is her last chance.
Thank you.Thank you.
How about I do something for you?
Tomorrow,I'll bring you a hat,
cover up the bald.
Listen,Phoebe. I was just talking to the director..
and he was thinking maybe this time you don't hit Drake.
You just wait on the tables.
I can't do that.
I'm an actor. I have a process.
You're a masseuse. You have a table with a hole in it.
Wait,I see what's happening here.
You're threatened.
What?
I'm so good in the scene that I'm stealing focus from you.
Rise to the challenge,Tribbiani,
because I just raised the bar.
Come join me up here.
Yeah,you can fire her,but I would call security.
She won't go easy.
You faked it? You couldn't have faked it.
Yes,you can. You just make the faces and the noises.
Guys can fake it?
Unbelievable. The one thing that's ours.
Why would you fake it
when we're trying to have a baby?
Well,that's actually why.
Look,I'm starting a whole new career now.
I'm not saying I don't want a baby.
I'm just saying maybe we could wait a little while.
Like a month?
Or a year?
Really? You wanna wait a year?
It could be less than a year.
I mean,you've heard my stuff.
"Pants. Like shorts but longer."
It'll probably be more than a year.
I really wanna have a baby.
Well,yeah,me too.
Look,I'll just get my old job back.
No,I want you to have a job that you love..
not statistical analysis and data reconfiguration.
I quit,and you learn what I do?
I think there's never gonna be
a right time to have a baby.
Now you're unemployed,and in a little while..
you'll find a new job that'll keep you really busy.
There's always gonna be a reason not to do this..
but I think once the baby comes,
we'll forget about all those reasons.
I guess.
I mean,it's always gonna be scary when we have a baby.
It's gonna be really scary.
I mean,God,when we have a baby..
there's gonna be so much that we're not able to control.
I mean,the apartment's gonna be a mess.
I won't have time to clean it.
What if the baby gets into the ribbon drawer..
and messes up all the ribbons?
What if there's no room for a ribbon drawer..
because the baby's stuff takes up all the space?
Where will all the ribbons go?
Should we go make a baby before you change your mind?
 Yes,please!  Okay.
And I promise I will not fake it this time.
Well,I wish I could say the same.
I'm a little shook up.
I know you botched that operation on purpose.
I can't prove it yet,
but when I do,
you'll be going to jail for murder.
I don't care if you are my brother.
I'm not your brother.
What about my children,Drake?
No! No! No!
God!
 Where's Mon?  She's at home..
putting up decorations for Rachel's birthday party tonight.
 You're not helping?  I tried..
but apparently
singing "I Will Survive" in a helium voice,not helping.
 Hey,guys.  Hey.
Happy birthday to...
Don't say that loud. Gunther's gonna want to hug me.
Good news,everyone. We finally found a nanny.
This is Molly.
Molly,Chandler,Joey.
Somebody's getting a little fussy.
You're damn right I am.
I've been waiting for a cookie for seven minutes.
Okay. You know what,I'm just gonna take her outside.
No,you stay. I'll do it.
Okay. Thank you.
 Nice to meet you guys.  Yeah,you too.
 Wow,Molly's just great.  Yeah.
Yes,bravo on the hot nanny.
What? You really think she's hot?
Are you kidding?
If I wasn't married,she'd be rejecting me right now.
Joey?
How do you think she's doing?
Am I the only one that doesn't think she's hot? Ross?
I mean,she's not unattractive,but..
but hot?
Thank you.
Now that Rachel's gone?
So hot,I cried myself to sleep last night.
Friends S09E12 The One With Phoebe's Rats
Hey,Mike,what's the capital of Peru?
 Lima.  No.
It starts with a V and ends with an X.
And hopefully with a TO in the middle.
You know,come to think of it,
the capital of Peru is "Vtox."
 Oh,God!  What?
Okay. I don't want to freak you out or anything..
but I just saw a rat in your cupboard.
Oh,yeah. No,that's Bob.
Well,he's your pet rat?
Well,not so much a pet as,you know,an occasional visitor..
who I put food out for. Kind of like Santa.
Except Santa doesn't poop on the plate of cookies.
You can't keep a rat in your apartment.
They're extremely unsanitary.
I mean,they transmit leptospirosis and hantavirus.
What are those?  I don't know..
but they don't sound like spa treatments.
 You have to get rid of it.  Okay,fine.
If it means that much to you,I'll get rid of Bob.
Thank you.
It's so weird you think he's so gross,
yet you're willing to eat his crackers.
Gavin,I just want to say thank you again..
for watching Emma yesterday during the presentation.
I really owe you an apology.
For what?
When we first met,you know..
I thought you were pompous and arrogant and obnoxious.
Is this your first apology?
No,I just mean,you know,
first impressions don't mean anything.
And I think you're a really good guy.
And I'm sorry that I misjudged you.
 Morning.  Hello.
But you know what? Hey,new day,new leaf.
I am just really,really happy..
I'm sorry. Obviously,
Heather's ass has something more important to say..
so I'll just wait till it's finished.
 What?  I was giving you an apology..
and you were totally checking her out.
I wasn't. I'm in fashion.
I was looking at her skirt.
Or was it pants? I didn't really see
what happened below the ass area.
Wow,you are really.. You're really a creep.
What do you care if I was looking at her?
Are you jealous?
Oh,yeah. I'm jealous.
"Oh,Gavin. Please,please look at my ass."
Stop looking at my ass!
I mean,I just think you are totally inappropriate. Okay?
This is a work environment. She's your subordinate.
But it was okay when you slept with your old assistant,Tag?
That is totally different for two reasons.
One: I didn't know that you knew that.
And two: I wasn't some creep staring at his ass.
We had a.. We had a deep,meaningful relationship.
What was Tag's last name?
It was..
Oh,my God.
He didn't.. He didn't.. He didn't have a last name.
It was just Tag,you know,like Cher or..
you know,Moses.
But it was a deep,meaningful relationship.
You know what? My first impression of you was absolutely right.
You are arrogant. You are pompous.
Morgan! Morgan!
 Tag's last name was Morgan!  It was Jones.
What are you,his boyfriend?
Man,I wish I had a nanny like you.
You mean when you were a baby?
Sure.
Would you stop staring at her?
I wasn't staring.
I was leering.
What's the big deal with her?
Maybe she's attractive in an obvious kind of way.
Yeah,obvious beauty's the worst.
You know,when it's right there in your face.
Me,I like to have to work to find someone attractive.
Makes me feel like I earned it.
Looks like Joey's doing all right with her.
Yeah. Hey,that was nice of you guys to back off..
and let Joey get the girl for once.
I'm gonna take her to the apartment.
Okay. I'll be home right after work.
 Okay.  Okay,bye,Emma.
I love you.
 Bye.  Bye.
They've elected me to talk to you
about the baby talk.
It's not so good.
I think it's sweet.
Bye,Emma!
Hey,listen,Joey. About Molly,
I would really prefer if you didn't go after her.
Why not?
It took months to find a good nanny.
And I wouldn't want anything to,you know,drive her away.
So you think I'm just gonna sleep with her..
and never call her again,
and things are gonna get uncomfortable?
Yeah,that sounds about right.
Come on,there are plenty of other women out there.
Just forget about her,okay? She's offlimits.
Oh,man! What'd you have to go and say that for?
Now that you told me I can't have her,
makes me want her even more!
 What are you,a child?  Yes!
Look,Joey,come on now. For me,please.
Just try to focus your sexual energy on someone else.
Fine.
Take me home.
 Hey,Mikey.  Hey,Phoebe.
 What are you doing?  Setting rattraps.
To kill Bob?
No. No,to test his neck strength.
No,I don't want to kill him.
I thought we were gonna capture him..
and,you know,set him free in the countryside..
where he could meet a friendly possum..
and a wisecracking owl.
Okay,okay. I'll throw away the traps.
All right,I'll find Bob. I'll get him.
Bob? Bob?
Robert?
Wait,I think I hear him.
Oh,my God! Bob had babies! Bob's a mom!
We'll have to think of a new name.
I don't know,I kind of like "Bob" for a girl.
No,no. I mean,I'm not sure that we..
Oh,my God. We killed Bob?
Well,maybe it wasn't Bob. Maybe it was a mouse.
Susie?
What's up?
Seriously,dude. Three years ago.
Listen,can you do me a favor?
I'm gonna be out today.
Can you keep an eye on Joey..
make sure nothing happens between him and Molly?
 You don't trust him?  Well,no.
Some woman who sounded a lot like Joey
called earlier..
and asked for her daughter,the "hot nanny."
Is this your longterm plan,for me to run interference?
Because I could get a job any day now.
You do appear right on the cusp of something.
Look,come on,man.
I'm sure he'll lose interest in a week or two..
but for now,could you please just do this for me?
Fine,but don't blame me if it doesn't work.
Because you know once Joey sets his mind on something..
more often than not,he's going to have sex with it.
Well,I mean,we've gotta do something. Okay?
Nannies like her don't grow on trees.
 Picturing that tree?  I am,yes.
Where you going,Joe?
For a walk.
You mind if I join you?
Actually,I'd rather be alone.
You know,I really need to organize my thoughts.
Your thoughts?
Plural?
All right,fine. I only have one thought.
It's about the hot nanny! I gotta see her!
I'm afraid I can't let you do that,Joe.
Now you're saying I can't see her?
You're killing me!
She's forbidden fruit! It's like,like..
like she's the princess and I'm the stable boy.
Why are you doing this,huh?
Did Ross tell you not to let me go over there?
Yes,as a matter of fact,he did.
So I can't let you go.
Interesting. Now there are obstacles.
Hot nanny and me against the world!
This is the stuff great novels are made of.
Great novels?
Fine. Mediocre porn.
Gavin Mitchell's office.
Rachel Greene's office.
Give me that phone.
Hello,this is Rachel Greene. How can I help you?
Okay then. I'll pass you back to your son.
Hey,Mom. No,that's just my secretary.
Excuse me,Gavin.
I have a question I need to ask you.
Mom,I'll call you later. Yeah.
 Yes?  If you like looking at butts so much..
why don't you just go look in a mirror?
Thank God you finally said that.
I saw you make a note on your pad three hours ago.
Man,I really bug you. Don't I?
Oh,no. Please..
I don't care about you enough to bug me.
In fact,from now on,
I'm going to take the high road..
and I'm going to be very,very nice to you,you mama's boy..
starting right now.
 Hey,Rach.  Hi.
Ready for your birthday lunch?
I am. I am.
But first,Monica,I would like to introduce you..
to my very talented colleague and more importantly..
my wonderful friend,Gavin Mitchell.
 Pleased to meet you.  Pleased to meet you.
Are you coming to Rachel's party?
Oh,no,no,no,no.
Gavin can't. He already has plans..
most likely with his mother.
I don't mind. I'll cancel them.
I would never miss my secretary's birthday.
Why did you invite him?
I can't stand that guy!
You were being so nice to him.
I was faking it.
Can't you tell when I'm being fake?
Hey,Mr. Phillips. Nice suit.
Right there. That was so fake!
I still can't believe you invited Gavin.
He is just the last person I want to see.
You're welcome for the party.
I'm glad you're having a good time.
I hope he doesn't show up.
Of course he won't,the guy hates me.
 Does he?  What?
Maybe he keeps bothering you so much because he likes you.
It's like in first grade
when Skippy Lange would always push me on the playground
because he secretly had a crush on me.
Monica,you think Skippy liked you?
Honey,all those boys had a bet
to see if he could knock you over.
She's out. I'm gonna take her home.
Okay. Thank you.
Bye,sweetheart.
Do you see what all the guys see in her?
Wouldn't kick her out of bed.
No more vodka for me.
Hey,Rach.
So can I sing "Happy Birthday" to you now?
 Yeah,sure.  All right.
Happy birthday to....
See you later.
Hey,Rach. Somebody got you shoes.
Give me!
 Wow. Wow. Oh,my God!  Careful! Careful!
These are my rat babies!
Yeah. We have rat babies now.
You brought rats to my birthday party?
So this is what a stroke feels like.
Well,I had to bring them. We killed their mother.
They're our responsibility now.
You know,they require constant care.
You should know that, Rachel, you're a mother.
Are you comparing my daughter to a rat?
No. Seven rats.
We should take them home.
We need to feed them.
You're gonna leave my party
to take care of a box of rats?
Well,I'm sorry,Rachel,
but I'm not like you. Okay?
Not everyone can afford help.
Hey,where the hell are Joey and Molly?
I asked you to watch them.
I'm sorry. I got a little preoccupied.
Look,we have to stop them before something happens.
Right behind you,big guy.
So you see,Molly,what people don't understand..
is that acting is a discipline.
It takes a lot of hard work.
So where'd you study?
I didn't go to college.
No,where'd you study acting?
Molly,people don't study acting.
Molly,do you mind giving us just a minute?
 Sure. I'll go check on Emma.  Thanks.
Will the stable boy never get the princess?
What do you think you were gonna do,
have sex with her right here on my couch?
No. The leather sticks to my ass.
You know, This isn't fair.
What makes you think I'm gonna sleep with her..
and then blow her off,huh?
Can't you guys open your minds to the possibility
that I actually like her..
and might want something real?
Look,the truth is,
I haven't felt this way
about anyone since Rachel.
Okay? I didn't think I could ever love again.
 Come on!  Joe!
Hi. Is Molly here?
Yeah,yeah. Come on in. Molly?
 Hey. Guys,this is Tabitha.  Hey.
 I'll see you tomorrow.  Okay.
Well,Joey,I guess we have no problem.
It's like my favorite fairy tale come true.
The princess,the stable boy and the lesbian.
Okay. Okay,you start preparing the formula..
and I'll start changing the box.
And then we gotta put them straight to bed.
When did we become one of those couples..
whose lives revolve around their rats?
Well,you know what? They're our responsibility now.
Okay,fine. These rats are our responsibility.
What happens when they mate and there are hundreds?
Mate? They're all brothers and sisters.
Yeah,not such a problem with rats.
No,they're more of a "love the one you're with" kind of animal.
No. Really?
Oh,my.. Get off your sister!
Oh,my God. What are we gonna do?
The.. We have seven rats.
So,what if each of them has seven rats..
and then each of those has seven rats? That's like..
That's math I can't even do!
What are we gonna do?
Well,I know this is gonna sound crazy..
but we could not let the box of rats
ruin our lives.
Yeah,okay. I guess you're right.
All right,so we should just give them away.
But to nice families with children
and reducedfat Wheat Thins.
Those were Bob's favorites.
It's gonna be okay.
You must think I'm crazy.
No,I think you're sweet.
Good. This is just so hard.
It's hard for me to let them go.
I guess it just brings back memories,you know..
from when I gave birth to my brother's triplets
and I had to give them up.
I haven't told you about that yet,have I?
Thanks for the party,honey.
Should I help you clean up?
No way. You had your party. Now I have mine.
 Is everything all right?  I just get bummed..
when my birthday's over.
Well,at least you have one thing to be happy about.
That jerk,Gavin,from your office didn't show up.
Yeah,I hate him.
We weren't talking about you. We were..
No. No way to recover. No. Okay.
 Fun party.  Well,it was.
And you would have seen it if you didn't show up at..
9:30?! God! This party was lame.
Again,you're welcome!
Look,I'll just give you this and go.
You bought me a present. Why?
Let me explain how birthday parties usually work.
There are presents..
and a cake,perhaps a fourth or fifth person.
Okay,I..
I got you the present
to make up for being such a jerk to you.
Well,okay. Well,that's very nice.
And you wrote a card.
 "From Gavin."  I really mean it.
It's beautiful.
If you don't mind..? Let me.
Well,what do you know,it fits.
See,Gavin. You're capable of being a nice guy.
Why do you give me such a hard time?
I'm not sure.
Well,Monica seems to think
it's because you have feelings for me.
I do have feelings for you.
You do?
Yes. I feel that you're a little annoying.
See,why? Gavin,why?
Right when I'm about to change my opinion of you,
you go and you..
And you do that.
Hey. Listen,I think I left something here.
Well,somebody left this. Is this yours?
No,but I like it.
No,I think I left one of my rat babies.
Well,no. I haven't seen it,
but if I do,I'll let you know.
Rat baby! Rat baby!
Rat baby! Rat baby!
Maybe that's him.
- Hey.  - Yeah. Yeah, okay. Sure.
Look, can we talk about
what happened here last night?
Sure. Just give me a second
to get all huffy and weird like you.
You believe that whoever did something last night
did what they did or didn't do? Come on!
Okay, you really don't know what I'm talking about?
- No.  - Okay. Last night, after the party...
I saw Rachel kissing that jerk
from her office out on your balcony.
Our balcony? Seriously?
That's so funny. I told Monica
we should put lights on our balcony
and she said, ''No, no. It's too cold.
Nobody will go out there.'' And I said:
'Maybe if we put some lights out there they will.
Right, that's what I came over to talk about.
I saw Rachel kissing some guy.
on your balcony, even though there were no lights!
So are you gonna talk to her?
Why? Why should I?
I mean, if she wants to move on, that's fine.
You know when ''that's fine'' sounds true?
When someone yells it and spits.
No, I'm serious.
I mean, if she wants to date people,
fine. I don't care.
But at least she could have told me.
You know, I've been putting my life on hold
and concentrating on Emma.
But if she wants to go out there kissing guys
she barely knows, then so will I.
Very funny! Ross is gay!
No, no. Good, so you're moving on.
Do you have any idea where you're moving on to?
I've got plenty of opportunities.
Just now, there was some woman at the coffeehouse smiled at me.
And then the other day on the subway, a woman
''accidentally'' sat on my hand.
Dude, don't rub my face in your crazy single life.
And there's an anthropologist at school who totally came on to me
during the interdepartmental potluck dinner.
Why did I get married?
Friends S09E13 The One Where Monica Sings
Hey, let me ask you guys something.
I'm having new headshots taken tomorrow.
The photographer said she thinks
I should have my eyebrows waxed.
Is that weird for a guy?
- Well, it depends.  - On?
On how far along he is in the sex-change process.
No, I totally disagree.
I think it's fine for a guy to do something like that.
Especially an actor.
I mean, not that you need to. Your eyebrows are....
Stop it, you guys. Stop staring, you're freaking me out.
Your knuckles are kind of hairy too.
Oh, man, now I have to get those done too?
Wow, talk about high maintenance.
You dye your hair.
- I'm a woman.  - Double standards!
Before I forget, are you coming to Mike's piano bar tonight?
Only if I don't have to get up and sing.
But everybody sings. It's so fun.
Last time, this adorable old man got up there,
forgot all the words, flipped out
and everyone booed him off the stage. It was so funny.
Look, I'm not good at singing.
Oh, what's the matter? You scared?
You afraid I'm a better singer?
You afraid I'm gonna beat you at singing?
Nope. Nope. It's not working on me.
Wow, I must be growing up.
Okay, fine. Just please come and support Mike.
You don't have to sing.
So I don't have to sing,
and I can just sit there and pass judgment on others?
- While drinking.  - I'm there.
Hi, you guys. Listen, I really need your help.
I think I did something really stupid.
Well, yes, Rachel, but you got something so beautiful out of it.
No, not that. I kissed Gavin last night.
- My God.  -You kissed him?
Yeah, it was after the party, we were on the balcony
Wait, wait, wait. I was at home the whole time.
How did I miss that?
Well, it was the end of the party. You were probably ironing wrapping paper.
Oh, yeah.
So how did you end up kissing?
We were all alone and he was being really nice...
and he gave me this scarf.
I thought you hated him.
Well, there is a thin line between love and hate...
...and it turns out that line is a scarf.
Are you thinking of starting something up with this guy?
I don't know. lt's so complicated. I work with this guy.
I have the baby, and I have Ross.
I don't know what to do.
And I have to be at the office and see Gavin in 10 minutes.
Sounds like you need to think about
what you want and talk to Gavin.
And you definitely should talk to Ross.
Or...
...I could call in sick and not deal with it at all.
Wow! Five months maternity leave, you're back for four days...
kiss a co-worker and call in sick.
They are lucky to have you.
- Hi.  - Hi.
I'm here for my eyebrow appointment.
Name?
Chandler Bing.
Okay, very good.
Have a seat right here, Mr. Bing,
and Sonya will be right with you.
Okay. Thanks.
I touched the stuff.
I'll take care of it.
Thanks.
So do you...? Do you get a lot of guys in here?
- Oh, absolutely.  - Oh, good.
You looking to meet somebody?
All right, let's just do this.
Okay, we'll get to the wax in a minute.
First, I want to tweeze some of the strays, okay?
Now, this may sting just a little bit.
Please, I have an extremely high threshold
Holy Mother of God! Oh, my face! My face!
I'm all right. I'm all right. I'm all right.
It's just a bit of shock, that's all.
- But I'll be fine. You can go again.   - Okay.
Sorry.
Damn it, woman!
It's the most eligible man in New York.
How's the moving on going?
Not well. I went on the subway again and someone did sit on my hand...
but that person was neither female nor wearing pants.
Maybe you're going about this the wrong way. I mean, think about it:
Single white male, divorced three times,
two illegitimate children.
The personal ad writes itself.
You know, that's funny. Yeah.
So do you think you'll ever work again?
What are you doing? You know I can only dish it out.
I can't believe Rachel just moved on
and didn't say anything to me.
Maybe she didn't move on.
Maybe that kiss was just an impulsive,
one-time birthday thing.
No, a month ago,
she gave her number to some guy in a bar.
Did she go out with him?
No. When he called
I threw the message away.
The high road.
All right, you know what? Enough.
Enough talking. I have to get moving.
Hey, check out those two blonds over there. Hey, come with me.
Are you trying to get everybody divorced?
You don't have to do anything.
It'll just be easier if it's two of us.
Like college, remember?
First, you break the ice with some kind of a joke
so they know you're the funny one.
I swoop in with interesting conversation...
so they'll see that I'm the brilliant, brooding, sexy one.
I thought I got to make the jokes.
Don't you have to be at work?
Oh, come on.
Hello. Hi, my name's Chandler.
This is my friend Ross right here.
We were wondering
if you're up for it,
we only need six more people for a human pyramid.
Swoop. Swoop.
Hey, I notice you're reading the paper.
Another flood in Europe, huh?
Here's a question:
Would you rather drown or be burned alive?
- I'm sorry, we're just leaving. - Okay.
We still got it.
Who is it?
Gavin. I brought you some soup.
- Why? - I heard you were sick.
Oh, right! Hold on, let me just clean up in here a little bit.
Hello, Gavin.
I missed you at work. How you feeling?
I'm not gonna lie to you, I'm pretty sick.
Oh, good. Because I was having a totally paranoid moment
where I thought you called in sick to avoid me.
Oh, no, no, no.
So I had fun last night.
So did I.
Exactly how contagious is this thing you have?
Is it a cold from standing on the balcony,
or did a monkey bite you?
- It's just a cold.  - Do you have a fever?
Let me see.
What? What is it? What's the matter?
What's Ross doing to you in that picture?
Oh, he's dusting me with a fossil brush.
He thought it would be funny.
- Right. Right.  - Yeah.
- Ross. - Yeah.
What's the deal with you guys?
I don't wanna get in the middle of anything.
You're not getting in the middle of anything.
Don't worry about Ross.
Hide! That's Ross! Hide!
Hide! Hide!
Yeah, but you said not to worry
I lied and I'm not sick either!
Just stay behind the curtain!
- Hi.  - Oh, Molly. You're not Ross.
No. I'm here to take Emma to your mother's, remember?
Right. Yes, yes.
- Don't panic.  - What?
There is a man behind your curtain.
I have Mace in my purse.
No, that's okay! No, no, no.
This is my business associate Gavin being silly.
Come out from behind there.
Hi. Gavin. Pleased to meet you.
It was my idea to stand there.
- Hello. I'll just go get Emma.  - Okay.
So...
why did I have to hide?
I thought it was Ross.
So what if it was?
I thought there was nothing going on between you.
There isn't. There totally isn't.
You hear keys in the hall
and you jump like a bronco coming out of the chute for the first time.
I used to be a rodeo clown.
All right, Iook, Gavin
I guess I felt guilty that you were here
which I shouldn't.
You know, Ross and I are not in a relationship
but he is the father of my child. And, you know
we do live together. And plus, there's just so much history, you know?
It's just-- I don't know.
I'm sorry. I'm just all over the place.
It's okay.
It's probably not my place,
but can I give you a piece of advice?
Yes.
I think you should talk to Ross about all this.
People keep saying that.
I'm sorry, Gavin.
Don't be.
It's just bad timing.
So seriously, rodeo clown?
One of the best, ma'am. One of the best.
"No time for losers,
'cause we are the champions of the world...!"
Thank you!
Oh, she's my girlfriend. That's not just how we do it here.
I'm gonna take a little break, and when we come back
.we've got Kenneth singing ''I Touch Myself.''
I'm not here to judge.
You have got to sing.
No, I told you I can't.
But you would have so much fun. And you have a really nice voice.
When have you heard me sing?
All the time, when you're cooking.
- What?  - Yeah, you're always singing:
Yummy, yummy, yummy I've got love in my tummy
Yeah, I do rock that one.
Isn't there just a little part of you that wants to get up there?
Just a little. But, God, it's so scary.
I don't even know what I would sing.
Well, I've got a book around
''Delta Dawn.''
Hi. I couldn't help but notice,
but that's an unusual necklace.
You already hit on me an hour ago.
Right. So that's a firm no?
I don't believe this. I just keep striking out.
I don't get it either.
I mean, you're obviously desperate.
You're asking women how they wanna be killed.
This is great. Rachel's gonna keep kissing guys
...until she finds the one she wants, and I'm gonna die alone.
By drowning or...?
Why would he break up with me?
I don't know, sweetie.
All I ever wanted was to just love him and have him love me back.
I mean, am I so unlovable?
- Wow. - I know.
All right. That was Kenneth with his
much too literal rendition of ''I Touch Myself.''
Coming up next, we've got Monica singing
''Delta Dawn.''
Wait. I can't sing in front of all these people.
Just pretend they're not even here. It's okay.
Once that spotlight hits you, it's so bright,
you won't see anyone anyway.
Hi, I'm Monica. And l'm going to be singing ''Delta Dawn.''
"Delta Dawn, what's that flower you have on?
Could it be a faded rose from days gone by? ..."
Can you totally see through her shirt?
Like an x-ray.
Bad day not to wear a bra.
"To take you to his mansion in the sky-y?"
I need your help.
Wow, it seems serious.
What seems to be the problem, Ashley Judd?
I'm getting new headshots taken. So I went to get my eyebrows shaped.
I'm sorry. Moment to make fun of that, please.
I may be a sissy, but I'll still pound you into the ground.
Look, it hurt so bad, I could only let her do one eyebrow, and now
they don't match!
It's like a baby caterpillar chasing its mama.
You got to help me out, okay? Look, I have a magic marker.
Fill in the skinny one so I don't look stupid for my pictures.
Okay, first of all, this is green.
What the hell am I supposed to do?!
All right, I will help you out...
but you have to promise you won't tell anyone what I'm about to tell you.
What? What?
Okay.
You know how most kids get their allowance
from mowing the lawn or taking out the garbage?
Well, I earned mine
by plucking the eyebrows of my father and his ''business partners.''
Oh, my God.
Yeah, well, I guess you don't need my help, Victor-Victoria.
No, no, no. I do. I do. I need your help.
But, Chandler, I don't know if I can
take any more plucking. It hurt so bad.
Not with my combination of ice cubes, aloe vera and my gentle.
self-loathing touch.
"To take you to his mansion in the sky-y?"
I'm sorry, the song's over.
Did you see me up there?
Every little bit of you.
I can't believe I sang in front of people
and they liked me.
Did you hear that guy shouting,
''Look at those tips''?{\r}\N{\fnTahoma\fs10\bord1\shad1\1c&HC0C0C0&\b0}tips:意同乳头
I mean, did I really help you get a lot of tips?
Sure.
Mon, not that you didn't sound good
Good?
Didn't you hear them? I was great!
Thank you so much for making me do this.
That is the best gift ever.
Also a good gift: underwear.
Thank you so much for letting me do this.
Public bathrooms freak me out.
I can't even pee, let alone do anything else.
But what's great is you don't mind talking about it.
It is so amazing
that I met you on the same day that Eric broke up with me
because it's like, you lose a boyfriend, and you get a boyfriend.
No, don't worry. This is not some rebound thing.
I am totally over Eric.
Good choice, Ross.
Hey. Hi. There you are.
I've been looking for you everywhere.
Hello. Well, here I am.
My mom is not bringing the baby back until 9:00.
So I was hoping you and I could have a chance to kind of--
Somebody here?
Oh, yeah. That's Michelle.
Who?
Oh, just this woman I've been seeing.
You've been seeing someone?
Yeah, didn't I mention that?
I mean, we haven't been going out too long...
but there's this amazing connection between us.
I mean, in fact just before you came in, she called me her boyfriend.
I thought it was a little too soon, but also, it felt kind of nice.
What are you taking amoxicillin for?
How great is this? You're already comfortable enough
to look through my stuff.
I'm sorry, Michelle, this is my roommate, Rachel.
And I'm also Emma's mother.
Who's Emma?
I told you about my daughter.
This is your daughter?
I could be your new mommy.
And done.
Oh, my God.
I didn't feel a thing. Hey, are you still looking for a job?
Because you could tweeze circles around
that sadistic bitch at the salon.
Thanks. Wanna see what it looks like?
Yeah.
They totally match. They look great.
They look great. How you doing?
Yeah, I think it looks pretty good.
I was a little worried I was
uncovering a birthmark right about there
but it turned out to be a little piece of chocolate.
Chandler, thank you so much.
No problem.
Listen, that was a pretty girlie hour we just spent.
We should do something manly to make up for it.
Yeah.
- Curl my eyelashes.  - Yeah!
For my next song,
I think I'll sing something a little more upbeat, all right?
How about the Pointer Sisters' ''I'm So Excited''?
And make it bouncy.
Well, you can probably take care of that on your end.
I'm sorry I'm late.
You'll understand when you see Joey.
Honey, you're just in time. I'm about to sing another song.
Really? In front of all these people?
And they love me.
Oh, my God.
She gives the people what they want.
All right, watch.
"Tonight's the night we're gonna make it happen,
tonight we'll put all other things aside.
Give in this time and show me some affection..."
Are those my wife's nipples?
Isn't that funny? I didn't see that before.
I wouldn't have let her go up again.
I've gotta stop this.
Who cares? They still love me.
You, touching yourself! Out!
Wow! She does that a lot.
Ross, you didn't tell me you were a doctor.
Wait a minute. You haven't even told her you are a doctor yet?
How long have you known her, like an hour?
Actually, about an hour and a half.
I told you it wasn't long, but there's an amazing connection between us.
You feel that too?
I thought that that was just me.
Are you kidding?
Do you wanna go away this weekend?
We'll see.
Ross, what's going on here?
Are we just bringing strange women back to the apartment now?
I don't know.
Are we just kissing guys on balconies?
How do you know about that?
Through the magic of sight.
I was here, putting our child to sleep
Emma.
When I looked through the window and saw you kissing a guy...
you've known for what, a week?
God, is that what this is all about?
You bring her up here to get back at me?
No, actually, see, I had to pee
because I can't use public bathrooms...
because of the doody parasites.
Okay, Michelle, it's time to go.
- Well, call me.  - Okay.
Wait, you don't have my phone number.
You know what? If it's meant to be, I'll guess it.
Bye-bye.
Score.
Did you not like her? Because I was hoping we could come
to your kissing parties on the balcony.
I can't believe you are making a big deal about this.
It was one kiss!
- One guy. One time! - Oh, really?
- Yeah. - Oh, really?
Oh, yeah.
- What about the guy from the bar?  - Who?
The guy you gave your number to.
How do you know about that?
Because he called here looking for you.
So don't tell me kissing this guy from work is a one-time thing.
Because you've been out there in bars and on balconies
for over a month now.
And you don't even have the courtesy to tell me.
- Why didn't I get that message?  - What?
From the guy in the bar? Why didn't I get that message?
Because I folded it up and put it in my pants pocket.
Do you not look there?
Ross.
I never gave it to you.
Why?
I don't know.
Oh, God, you know what? I don't
Who do you think you are? Who are you to decide
what messages I should or should not get?!
- Who am I?  -Yes
I'm the guy who's taking care of our baby...
while you're at bars meeting guys!
I cannot believe you.
I actually came in here hoping to have a mature conversation with you about us.
But I can't do that with someone who hides my messages
and brings crazy women back to my apartment!
Hey, none of the sane ones wanted to come back with me!
That's not the point, okay? The point is
you are the one who moved on and didn't tell anyone.
Oh, God, Ross, this is just so messed up.
What is wrong with us?
When people hear about our situation, they ask:
''You live together, but you're not a couple,
yet you have a baby? Isn't that weird?''
And I say, ''No. It's not, because it works for us.''
But you know what? This doesn't work.
ln fact, this is the opposite of working.
Clearly.
And you know...
we said that we would live together
as long as this makes sense
and maybe this just doesn't make sense anymore.
Yeah, maybe not.
So, what do you wanna do?
Hi.
Can Emma and I live here for a while?
God.
- Of course.  - Thank you.
Your eyebrows look weird.
"Jeremiah was a bullfrog.
Was a good friend of mine,
never understood a single word he said,
but I helped him drink his wine."
So you'll just touch yourself for anything, then?
- Morning, roomie.  - Hey!
You remembered to put clothes on this morning.
Fifth day's a charm.
Oh Joey, it's so great to be back here.
You're making it so easy on me and Emma.
It's great having you back.
Stay as long as you want.
And when does she stop
crying all night?
Hey! You're not naked.
Rach, when will we expect to see you tonight?
I probably be back around 6.
But she's in the bedroom, all ready to go.
But she did fell back to sleep, so
She's probably exhausted from
all that adorable screaming she did last night.
- Bye.  - Bye.
Hey, I hope Emma isn't making it too hard on you.
No, hey, it's been great.
I just want you to know that with Rachel staying here...
all my feelings from before are totally over.
And even if they weren't
when you walk in on a woman using a breast pump
- Yeah, that'll do it.  - Wow!
So how are you?
- I'm okay.  - Really?
Sure. I mean, do I wish
me and Rachel living together would have worked out?
Of course. You know, I'm disappointed,
but it's not like it's a divorce.
Well, actually it
It's not a divorce. It is not a divorce!
Anyway, I think Rachel and I need to get on with our lives.
Maybe start seeing other people.
Wow. Really?
Sure, why not?
In fact, if you know anyone that'd be good for me...?
Sure. I know lots of girls.
Any names come to mind?
Names?
Friends S09E14 The One With The Blind Dates
I was about to eat. Want something?
What you got?
Okay, let's see, we got strained peas, strained carrots...
strained plums. We haven't tried that yet!
Goody!
Thanks.
So how is it living with Rachel again?
I mean, apart from the great food?
I'm fine, I'm fine. It's just....
It's just weird what's happening with her and Ross.
Yesterday he asked me to fix him up with somebody.
Rachel asked me if I knew anyone for her too.
- Why are they doing this?  - I don't know.
They're so perfect for each other. It's crazy.
You know what's crazy?
These jars. It's like two bits in here?
I just wish they'd realize they should be together.
I know, I know. When they moved in together,
I figured that's where things were headed.
I know. They should be a family.
They should marry and have more children.
Yes. And they should name one of their kids Joey.
I may not have kids.
Someone's gotta carry on the family name.
You know what? Maybe once they start dating
and see what's out there
they'll realize how good they are for each other.
Yeah, because it is slim pickings.
I had this date last night. Yuck!
But we should probably keep it down, she's still in the bedroom.
So, what are we gonna do?
Are we just gonna set them up with people?
I know, that just pushes them further and further apart.
I know what we can do.
We could set Ross and Rachel up on horrible dates...
so they'll realize how good they are together.
- That's a great plan.  - Yeah.
You know what the best part of it is?
I get to do my plan laugh.
Okay, shh! Not so loud. We don't want to wake up
Hi. You guys aren't doing anything tonight, are you?
See, now, why would you assume that?
Just because we're married?
I mean, I will have you know that we are very hip, happening people.
Now if you'll excuse me,
I have to get back to reading the obituaries.
I was just asking because I need someone to watch Emma tonight.
Sure we'll do it. What are you up to?
Well, Phoebe set me up on a date.
Oh, my God.
Why? What's the big deal?
I figured because you and Ross are--
What? Slept together a year and a half ago?
Yeah, I'm all set.
I think it's great you're going on a date.
It sounds healthy.
I mean, you have needs.
Embrace your womanhood.
You want a job?
Turn off Oprah and send out  resume.
I'll bring her by around 7, okay?
That's perfect.
You guys are gonna have so much fun.
She's at such a cute age.
A couple things. Now that she eats solid food,
she poops around the clock.
And watch out for your hair because she likes to grab it.
She's also in this phase
where if you leave the room, she screams, but....
Thanks, you guys. Have fun.
Suddenly I wish I was reading my own name.
Joey, hey. I'm so excited.
I set Rachel up with the worst guy.
All right. Who is he?
It's a guy I used to massage. By ''massage'' ...
I mean hold down so he wouldn't turn over and flash me.
Wait till you hear who I got for Ross.
Oh, yeah.
Okay. She's this really boring woman. She's a teacher.
A teacher?
She's into history and foreign movies.
And she loves puzzles.
Come on, who loves puzzles?
Well, Ross does.
You're ruining the plan!
Joey, you fixed him up with his perfect woman.
- Oh, my God, you're right!  - Yeah.
She even reads for pleasure!
How do you know a woman like that?
I'm not allowed to know smart women?
Joey?
We met at the library. I went in to pee.
- So now what do we do?  - Well, okay.
I'll call her and tell her the date's canceled
and find him somebody else.
What if we don't find him somebody else?
We'll just tell her the date's off...
...but we don't tell Ross.
He'll go to the restaurant and get stood up.
I hear that's bad.
So this is great. Rachel's gonna have a terrible date
Ross gets stood up,
and then they'll realize how good they have it together.
Yes, the plan.
It's not Santa's plan.
No, it's....
Yeah, you know, it's not that fun.
No, I think we killed it.
Emma? Emma, look at me!
Well, I think I'll go downstairs for a while.
No, no, no! It's okay! It's okay! I didn't go!
Don't cry, it's just a bit!
I'm your Uncle Chandler.
Funny is all I have!
Okay, just so you know, I'm gonna be ovulating from tomorrow until the 6th.
So don't touch yourself
for the next 48 hours.
I don't do that.
I'll try to stop.
- Did you say until the 6th?  - Yeah.
Today is the 6th.
No, it's not.
Yes, it's also 2003.
Oh, my God. Today's the 6th?
I may be done ovulating!
I may have also served some very questionable meat at the restaurant.
- Go take the test, see if we're okay.  - Okay.
Tough crib.
Hey, where are all my ovulation sticks?
There's only one here.
I might have checked to see
if I was ovulating a couple times.
Chandler!
I'm not working! There's not much to do around here!
Excuse me.
Is there a woman waiting at the bar?
Someone average height, dark hair?
Or perhaps doing a puzzle?
There's a drunk Chinese guy.
Well, if I'm still here in an hour,
buy him a drink on me.
Can I get you another glass of wine?
I don't know if I should. I don't want to be drunk when I...
...go home alone tonight.
Got stood up, huh?
It's no big deal. It's just a blind date.
Are you worried your date came,
saw you and left?
No!
We're okay. I'm still ovulating.
Oh, good, because as of 4:00 this afternoon,
I am not.
So let's do this.
- I don't think I can.  - Oh, come on.
I know you're not 18 anymore,
but give it a minute.
- Because of Emma.  - Oh, my God, Emma.
Oh, sweetie, I forgot you were here.
You're right, we can't do this.
We can't leave her alone.
Sorry.
Unless...
maybe we do it here.
I mean, how much can she even be aware of at this age?
She's aware when we leave a room.
She may notice if we start...
...canoodling in it.
Canoodling?
Well, I can't say hump or screw...
in front of the B-A-B-Y.
I don't know, I guess having sex in front of a baby...
- isn't so....  - Horrifying? Scarring?
Something people go to jail for?
- I guess you're right.  - You guess I'm right?
When we at that bed-and-breakfast,
you wouldn't have sex with me
because you thought
a deer was staring through the window.
Well, what kind of a sick bastard
wants to do it in front of a deer?
Wow, everything looks so good.
I think I'm gonna have the chicken.
I just have to say this.
You're really beautiful.
Wow, that's very sweet. Thank you.
I'm kind of funny-looking.
- What?  - Look, I mean, come on...
...you're way out of my league.
Everybody in here knows it.
I bet that guy over there is probably saying:
''Why's she out with him?"
"He must be rich.''
Well, I'm not.
What do you think you want to order?
I'm real excited about that chicken.
I'm not funny, either.
So if you were thinking,
"Well, he's not that good-looking..."
"but maybe we'll have some laughs,''
that ain't gonna happen.
Well, come on, Steve,
let's not rule out nervous laughter.
Hey, now, wait a minute, Phoebe told me
that you owned your own restaurant. That's impressive.
I lost it to drugs.
I silk-screen T-shirts now.
Really? What's that like?
It's really fulfilling doing something
you hate for no money.
That's right. I have no money, I'm not funny...
I live in a studio apartment
with two other guys.
And I'm pretty sure l'm infertile.
Now, come on. Come on, Steve.
There must be something that you like about yourself.
I do like my hair.
Really?
- Hello?  - Phoebe, it's me!
I'm going to hunt you down and kill you.
Hey, Rach!
This is the worst date ever!
How could you set me up with this creep?
You know, you are talking about
one of my dear, dear friends.
I don't care. This guy is a nightmare.
All right, so he gets a little crazy
when he's stoned.
He's not stoned.
Did he go out for a cigarette?
- Yeah. Four times.  - My dear, sweet Rach.
Well, our plan is working.
Rachel's having a miserable time...
and Ross is stood up somewhere at a restaurant
all alone.
Pretty soon they'll be back together.
By the time anyone's figured out what we've done,
we'll be in sunny Mexico.
Oh, wait, that's the end of a different plan.
She's asleep. Chandler?
What are you doing?
Emma was doing it.
She's asleep.
She's asleep. That means we can....
Yes. But we have to be fast.
Oh, okay, I'll try.
And you can't make any noise.
Okay, I'll try.
Hello?
Emma?
Hey! Hi!
How are you? How are you?
Where are your babysitters, huh?
Why is the bedroom door closed?
You can't have S-E-X
when you're taking care of a B-A-B-I-E.
I've got bad news. The Chinese guy left.
If it was meant to be,
it's meant to be.
Look, you got stood up. Who cares?
We're gonna show you a good time.
Sit and relax.
In fact, let me bring you
a crab-cake appetizer on the house.
Wow, free crab cakes? Well, that's nice.
Although I was hoping to have sex tonight.
Just the crab cakes.
What are you doing? Are you trying to get him to stay?
You can't do that.
Just get out of here, okay?
I'm sorry, what's going on?
Okay, the waiters have a little pool going.
We have a bet on how long it'll take
before you give up and go home.
What?!
You're making money off my misery?
Well, if you stay till 9:20, I am.
This is unbelievable.
I have never been so insulted in my life.
Now, if you'll wrap up my free crab cakes,
I'll be on my way.
Well, that was weird.
You were loud and I was fast.
I think we may have really done it this time.
I wish l didn't have to wait to take a pregnancy test.
You may want to get some more of those too.
Where's Emma?
Oh, my God, where's Emma? Where's Emma?
Don't ask me.
I was in there canoodling you.
Okay. Okay. I'm sure that Rachel came home early
and picked up Emma.
You go look across the hall, and I'll call her cell.
You better hope we're pregnant...
because one way or another,
we're giving a baby back to Rachel!
I can't believe I'm crying in front of you.
You must think I'm so pathetic.
No, no, no, I admire a man who can cry.
- Really?  - Don't touch my coat.
Sorry, that's my phone.
- Hello?  - Hey, Rach, how's it going?
Oh, my God, this is the worst date ever.
Oh, come on.
Look, you know what, I'm sorry,
but did you really think that this was going well?
- What's up?  - Hey, did you stop by here?
- No.  - Oh, my God! Then....
Thank God! Emma, there you are!
What? What do you mean, ''there you are''?
Where was she?
We were playing peekaboo.
She loves it when I'm dramatic.
Why the hell did you take her?
Because you two were having sex!
- No, we weren't.  - Don't you lie to me.
I can tell by Chandler's hair.
You are so lazy. Can't you get on top for once?
All right. All right, we were.
We're trying to make a baby.
Monica's ovulating.
It's unacceptable that you'd have sex
with Emma in the next room.
I'll have to tell Rachel about this.
Please don't. She will kill us.
Hey, I gotta. Unless....
Unless what?
Unless you name
your first-born child Joey.
What? Why?
Hey, I may never have kids...
and somebody's gotta carry on
my family name.
Your family name is Tribbiani.
You almost had me.
Look...
I think I know the answer to this question,
but...
would you like to make love to me?
Really, really not.
It's just as well.
It doesn't work anyway.
All right, well, that's good to know. Good night, Steve.
Hey, what's wrong?
I just had a rough night.
Crab cake?
Well, what happened?
This is kind of weird to talk to you about this, but--
Monica told me you had a blind date.
- Yeah.  - I did too.
But is it technically a date
if the other person doesn't show up?
Oh, no. Do you think she walked in, saw you and left?
Why does everyone keep saying that?
If it makes you feel any better,
I wish my date hadn't shown up.
That bad?
Well, he makes T-shirts for a living...
...and he thought it would be appropriate to give me...
this.
''Female Body Inspector''?\NFBI:也是联邦调查局Federal Bureau of Investigation的缩写
What size is that?
Now wait a minute. So they're gonna
name their first child Joey?
How do I get them
to name the next one
after me?
It's easy. You just walk in
on them having sex.
Oh, so they owe me, like, three Phoebes.
Oh, my God! Look, it's Ross and Rachel!
The plan is working!
Don't do the plan laugh.
The first dates we've had in months,
and they were both such disasters.
You know, it is weird...
...that Phoebe would set me up on a date that was awful...
...on the same night
Joey set you up on a date
that didn't even show.
Wait a minute.
You don't think it was intentional?
I mean, that's just stupid.
We're geniuses.
Look at them! They're really bonding.
They're falling in love all over again.
Oh, they see us.
Oh, they look mad.
They figured it out.
They're coming. Run!
- Where?  - Mexico!
Can you believe they're still not here?
I know. A double blind date
and we both get stood up.
What are the chances?
I know, I'm so bummed.
Could we have our free crab cakes now?
- What?  - We've been stood up.
And we want our free crab cakes.
Guys, give it a rest.
Nobody's betting on you tonight.
Although we do have a pool going to see
how long it takes that guy to cry.
I have such fat hands!
Guys! Guys! I've got great news. Guess what.
Monica's pregnant!
Really?
Let's get past the moment.
- What's your news?  - Thank you.
I got a job in advertising.
Honey, that's incredible!
Gosh, what's the pay like?
Oh, come on, people.
If I don't know who makes the most
how do I know who I like the most?
Hi, Joey.
It pays nothing. It's an internship.
We have interns at Days of Our Lives.
Right. So it'll be the same,
except less sex with you.
What do you think they'll have you do there?
It's a training program,
but they hire the people
they like.
That's great!
Yeah, I mean, there's probably gonna be
some grunt work...
which will stink. A grown man getting people coffee
is humiliating.
Humiliating and noble.
Thank you.
You know, if I didn't already have a job
I would've been good in advertising.
Ross, you did not come up with:
"Got Milk?"
Yes, I did! I did!
I should've written it down.
Friends S09E15 The One With The Mugging
Where's Chandler?
I want to wish him good luck on his first day.
And I smelled bacon.
- He just left.  - Who did?
Joey, you're never gonna believe it! She called!
- She did?  - You got it!
- I did?  - What is she talking about?
I don't know, but it sounds great!
Your agent called.
You got that audition!
- With Leonard Hayes?  - Yes!
Oh, my God, that is great!
It's for a play on Broadway.
And in a real theater.
Not that little one underneath the deli like last time.
- Is it a good play?  - It must be.
I read it
and didn't understand a single word!
Leonard Hayes is starring in it.
Yeah, and directing.
He was so good in that movie of Macbeth
You saw that?
No, but I saw the previews.
They played it right before Jackass.
He's done some amazing work.
Oh, yeah.
I loved him in those phone commercials.
When the monkey hits him in the face
with the giant rubber phone....
Maybe the monkey will be at the audition.
Don't make me more nervous than I already am!
Good morning, everybody.
Can I get you a cup of coffee, sir?
Oh, no, no. I'm an intern, just like you guys.
Except for the tie, the briefcase
and the fact that I can rent a car.
Seriously, you're an intern?
I'm heading in a new career direction
and you gotta start at the bottom.
Dude.
I know I'm a little older than you guys,
but it's not like I'm Bob Hope.
The comedian. USO.
It's U.S.A., sir.
This is Joey Tribbiani.
Joey, these are the producers.
And as you probably already know,
this is Leonard Hayes.
It is so amazing to meet you.
l am such a big fan of your work.
I've been blessed with a lot of great roles.
Tell me about it, huh?
''Unlimited nights and weekends!''
Are you making fun of me?
Because I am not a sellout.
I didn't do it for money.
I believe in those phones!
I almost lost a cousin because of bad wireless service.
No, I wasn't making fun of you.
Honestly, I think you were great in those commercials.
Really?
Yeah.
Well, I do bring a certain credibility to the role.
That's true.
Are you kidding? When they shoot you out of that cannon--
''Hang up that phone!''
- One take.  - Wow.
So shall we read?
Oh, yeah, sure.
Top of Act 2. This is my entrance. You got it?
What the hell are you still doing here?
- I think you know.  - Bastard!
I am what you made me. You know what?
I could go right now.
- Go! Go!  - I can't.
Oh, I want to, Long Pause
but I can't.
So sorry. You're not supposed to say ''long pause.''
Oh! Oh, I thought that was your character's name. You know?
I thought you were, like, an Indian or something,
you know, with the....
No. Thank you so much for coming in.
We appreciate it. Thank you.
You don't want me to do it again?
- I could do an accent.   - No.
You know, Southern.
''I could go right now, mon!'' Huh?
My God in heaven.
Joey, hang on.
Leonard, can we talk to you for a moment?
Yes? You've got to be kidding.
He can't act.
I don't care if you think he's hot.
lf you want to sleep with him, do it on your own time.
This is a play.
If you insist on this...
I will call my agent so fast
on a cell phone connection so clear, he's gonna think I'm next door!
Hi, thank you so much for whispering for my benefit.
Tell me what I did wrong. I'd love to work on it
and try it again for you.
And also, how you doing?
Give me another chance.
I really want to get better. Please?
If you want to come back the end of today.
here are my notes.
- Ready?  - Yeah.
You're in your head.
You're thinking way too much.
I really doubt that.
No, no. It's that you're not connected with anything in your body.
There's no urgency.
The scene is a struggle.
It's a race. Also,
what you did was horizontal.
Don't be afraid to explore the vertical.
And don't learn the words.
Let the words learn you.
Couldn't I just sleep with the producer?
Hey, do you want to go to dinner tonight?
l can't. l've got a date with that waitress, Katie.
l know we've only gone out, like, twice, but l don't know...
l have a good feeling about her.
Oh, l hear divorce bells.
Give me your wallets, and there won't be a problem.
What?
l have a gun.
Okay, relax, Phoebe. Just stay calm.
Oh, my God, l can't find my wallet!
All right, lady, now give me your purse.
No.
What do you mean ''no''?
l knew you'd be my death, Phoebe Buffay!
Lowell, is that you?
Phoebe?
Oh, my God!
Unbelievable! Oh, my God!
l'm sorry. Ross,
this is my old friend, Lowell, from the streets!
Lowell, Ross.
Ross, nice to meet you.
Yeah, a real pleasure.
lt's been so long! Oh, so long.
l can't believe you're still doing this.
l know. But l quit smoking.
Good for you.
You look like you're doing well.
l guess your mugging days are behind you.
Oh, my God. Phoebe, you used to mug people?
Excuse me, Ross, old friends catching up.
How'd the audition go?
They want to see me again, but...
...Leonard Hayes did not like me.
What happened?
He said l wasn't urgent enough.
Everything l did was horizontal,
and l should be more vertical.
He said that l should think less.
Well, so far so good.
Honey, l'm old!
What's wrong?
I am so much older than these other interns.
I can't compete with them.
So you're a little older.
Look at the positive. You have all this life experience.
Yes, but I don't think life experience
is gonna help me with these.
Wow! It's like they're on fire!
What are they?
Prototype sneakers.
I need ideas on how to sell them. Which I can't do...
...because no self-respecting adult
would ever wear these.
I'll give you $500 for them.
What am I supposed to do?
Come on, sneakers are easy.
You wear them all the time.
They're not called sneakers anymore.
They're called ''kicks'' or ''skids.''
I think I heard somebody say ''slorps.''
They've got wheels that pop out from the bottom
so you can roll around...
because apparently walking is too much exercise.
''Kids! Kids!
Roll your way to childhood obesity!''
Would you help me try to sell these?
Okay. Have you considered using a girl with huge knockers?
That's not what they're looking for.
Hey, that would work on me.
Why do you think I buy Mrs. Butterworth's?
You'll never guess what just happened.
- Phoebe and I got mugged!  - Are you okay?
Yeah. Phoebe knew the mugger.
How do you know a mugger?
I'm sorry, I have friends
outside the six of us.
Know how she knew him?
Because Phoebe used to mug people.
Seriously?
Well, I'm not proud of it,
but, you know...
...when I was living on the street
and I needed money for food and stuff....
Phoebe, that is awful.
I wasn't rich like you guys, okay?
I didn't eat gold and have a flying pony.
I had a hard life.
My mother was killed by a drug dealer.
Your mother killed herself.
She was a drug dealer.
Anyway, it was a good thing she knew him.
I was about to do some serious damage.
Okay.
This must have brought back some bad memories for you, Ross.
- Why?  - Ross was mugged as a kid.
- You were?  - Yeah.
And it was pretty traumatic.
It was outside St. Mark's Comics.
I was minding my business,
seeing what kind of trouble Spider-Man was into.
Wonder Woman.
Anyway, I was heading towards this bakery...
to pick up a couple of dozen linzer tortes for someone...
when out of nowhere, this thug with a pipe jumps out
and says:
''Give me your money, punk!''
Oh, my God.
I know. And the worst part was,
they took my backpack...
...which had all the original artwork
I did for my own comic book,
Science Boy.
Oh, yeah! What was his super power again?
A super-human thirst for knowledge.
I better get to class.
Are there any more of your friends
I should look out for? Phoebe.
No. Actually, you might want to stay away from Jane Street.
That's where Stabby Joe works.
- I think we have a problem here.  - What?
Back in my mugging days,
I worked St. Mark's Comics.
- Yeah?  - A pipe was my weapon of choice...
...and preteen, comic-book nerds were my meat.
So?
There was one kid
who had a sticker on his backpack that said:
- Geology rocks!  - Geology rocks!
Oh, my God!
I know! I mugged Ross!
- You're late.  - I know. I'm sorry.
But can I just run to the bathroom?
No. Leonard doesn't wait.
But I am bursting with Yoo-hoo!
Joey, here we go!
Let's go. Very quickly.
I really need--
We must go now, quickly.
- Yeah. Yes, sir.  - Ready?
What the hell are you still doing here?
I think you know!
Oh, you sick bastard!
I  am what you made me! Know what?
What?
I could go right now.
Then go. Go!
Oh, I can't. I want to, but I can't!
Cut. That was good!
Very good. You did everything I asked.
I did?
Yes. Plus which, you've got this, I don't know, this squirmy quality
you bring to the character I couldn't have imagined.
Here's what we're gonna do:
Come back tomorrow for the final callbacks.
Do all of this, what you got going now. But you know what?
More. More. Can you do that?
Sure. I don't have time to say thank you
because I really gotta go!
Look at that! Still in character. I like him.
I plant seeds. I can't explain it. I don't know.
Hey. What are you doing?
Putting on the sneakers...
to get in the young mindset,
see if it sparks anything.
- Oh, anything yet?  - Yes, how's this?
''They're so uncomfortable,
it's like getting kicked in the nuts for your feet.''
You're probably wondering what I'm doing.
No, that seems about right.
Yesterday at my audition, I really had to pee.
Apparently, having to pee makes me a good actor.
I got a callback,
so I'm drinking everything. Oh, by the way...
that eggnog in our fridge was great!
Joey, that was formula.
We gotta get more of that.
These aren't half bad.
You should suggest these to Ralph Lauren.
Okay, first of all, that's stupid.
Second, I'm not allowed to talk to Ralph.
All right. I feel younger already.
Yeah, I think I broke my hip.
Hey, you!
Hey.
Hey. How was class?
No one asks me that. What's wrong?
- Nothing. I really want to know.  - Oh.
Well, there was actually a rather lively discussion
about the Pleistocene--
All right, nothing is worth this.
I have a confession to make.
Okay, you know that girl that mugged you when you were a kid?
What are you talking about? It wasn't a girl.
It was this huge dude.
You don't have to lie anymore. I know that it was a 14-year-old girl.
No, it wasn't.
Yes, it was.
You don't think I would have defended myself against a 14-year-old--?
''Give me your money, punk!''
Oh, my God, it was you!
I can't believe it. You mugged me?
Yeah. And I'm so, so sorry, Ross. I'm sorry.
But, you know, if you think about it, it's kind of neat.
I mean, well,
it's just that I've always felt kind of like an outsider.
You know, the rest of you have connections that go way back...
...and, you know, now you and I have a great one.
It's not the best!
I know. Please forgive me.
I don't know what to say.
There's nothing you can say!
That was the most humiliating thing ever.
Even more humiliating than--
Let's not do this!
And then, at the end of the commercial,
the girls get out of the hot tub...
...and start making out with each other.
That's interesting.
Just one thought:
You didn't mention the shoes.
Who's next? Chandler.
You start on the image of a guy putting on the shoes.
He's about my age.
- Your age?  - Aha!
He's rolling down the street and he starts to lose control.
Maybe he falls.
Maybe he hurts himself.
Just then,
a kid comes flying by wearing the shoes.
He jumps over the old guy and laughs.
And the line reads:
''Not suitable for adults.''
Well, Chandler, that's great.
Thank you, sir.
Or, man who's two years younger than me.
You see, that has a clear selling point.
It appeals to our key demographic.
How did you come up with that?
I don't know! I don't know!
I was just trying to get into a young mindset,
and stuff started to flow.
That is great. Good work.
Thank you.
We'll see all of you tomorrow.
The cold weather hurts my hip.
Hey, Ross. I know you're still mad at me,
but can I just talk to you for a sec?
Sure, go ahead. Oh, sorry.
Sure, go ahead.
I just really wanted to apologize again.
And also show you something
I think you'll find very exciting.
Oh, my God!
''Crap from the street!''
Look, Ross. In this box...
...are all the things I got from mugging
that I thought were too special to sell...
or smoke.
Anyway, I was looking through it, and I found...
Science Boy.
Oh, my God!
I never thought I'd see this again.
It's all here!
What made you save it all these years?
I guess I just thought it was really good.
And maybe it would be worth something one day.
You really thought Science Boy was worth saving?
Yeah. But you should know
I also have a jar of Vaseline
and a cat skull in here.
Still, this is amazing!
Oh, my God. Thank you, Phoebe.
You're welcome. Thank you for Science Boy.
I learned a lot from him.
You're welcome.
I need an answer!
I can't tell you something I don't know.
You know!
I don't know!
I need an answer now!
You want an answer? The answer is....
She never loved me. She only loved you.
You knew this all along and you never told me?
You never told me?
I can never forgive you.
I can never forgive you myself.
I have nothing to live for. Bang! And scene!
Absolutely amazing.
The part is yours.
Thanks! Now I really gotta go.
No, wait! Congratulations! You did it.
You did it. You can relax now. Yeah.
Wow! That's a big cable bill.
You don't have a job,
but you have no problem ordering porn.
On a Saturday afternoon?
I was in the house!
Hey. Phoebe didn't by any chance mention that--
She was the huge guy that mugged you? Yeah.
I see. You didn't happen to tell--
Everybody we know? Yeah.
Great. Thanks.
Have you seen our bank statement?
Can this be right?
I know. God,
I haven't seen my savings take a hit like this...
since I was a kid and they came up with Double Stuf Oreos.
What happened to all of our money?
I'm not sure exactly what they did...
but I'm inclined to blame Enron.
I guess with you doing the internship,
we're spending more than we're bringing in.
Yeah, maybe I should quit
and get a job that pays.
But you're finally doing something that you love.
I mean, I can't ask you to give that up.
Although it would be nice if the thing that you loved
was finding gold.
You know, I think we're making too big a deal out of this.
We'll pay our bills late this month.
Next month we'll cut back on a few things.
And maybe we start eating out of Joey's refrigerator
for a change.
You're a chef.
What can you make out of baking soda and beer?
Worst-case scenario is,
we borrow some money from my parents.
No, and we're not borrowing money.
- Why not? -We don't do that.
We are Bings.
If there's one thing my father taught me, it was...
well, to always knock
before going into the pool house.
The other thing is, never borrow money.
I had no idea you had this much pride.
That's right, I do. I am your man.
I'm gonna get us through this situation...
even if it means you working twice as hard.
Friends S09E16 The One With The Boob Job
- I'm gonna go.  - Why?
I haven't been home in days,
and I need to get more clothes.
You don't have to go.
I have something that'll fit you.
I put that tube top on as a joke.
I want you to stay.
I want to stay too.
But I've got as much use out of these boxers as I can.
- Why don't you turn them inside  - Done it.
I'll be back in a couple of hours.
All right. I'll miss you.
Me too.
You know what? I just realized something.
I don't want to go home.
Great! Okay, I'll go get the tube top.
No, no, what I mean is...
I hate going back to my apartment now.
Partly because I live above a known crack den...
...but, you know, mostly because when I'm there,
I really miss you.
So...
do you want to move in together?
Wow, Mike Hanigan...
...you sure know how to make a girl say ''Hell, yeah.''
So we're doing it?
Yeah, let's do it. Let's live together.
We're really gonna move in together?
Yeah.
I've always wanted to live with a guy.
Pick up your socks.
Put down the toilet seat.
No, we are not having sex anymore.
It's gonna be fun.
- Hey, Joey.  - Hey.
Listen, I need to know that what
I'm about to ask you...
will never get back to Chandler.
I'd be lying if I said I hadn't
thought about it myself.
But Chandler is my best friend.
It would be wrong.
Good, but wrong.
Okay, first of all, it would be great.
But that's not what I'm here to talk to you about. I need to borrow money.
Oh, I don't know, Monica. You know
lending friends money is always a mistake.
But Chandler lent you money.
And he would tell you it was a mistake.
Come on, I just....
I need it for some rent and some other bills.
Well, how much?
Two thousand dollars?
Two thousand dollars?
What do you think I am, a soap opera star?
- Yeah.  - That's right, I am.
- Hi, you guys.  - Hey.
What's in the bag?
You know how Emma started crawling?
I realized that this place is very unsafe for a baby...
...so I went to the store
and I got some stuff to baby-proof the apartment.
Oh, God, baby-proofing.
Why is it such a big deal now?
You know, when I was a kid, it was like:
''Whoops, Joey fell down the stairs.''
Or, ''Whoops, Joey electrocuted himself again.''
Anyway, are you going to get a handyman to install this stuff?
No, I was just gonna do it myself.
- You're gonna do it?  - Yeah. Why?
You don't think a woman can do this?
Women can. You can't.
Monica, will you please tell Joey that he is a pig.
You're a pig. And you can't do this.
What?
What? Come on, I found the hardware store all by myself.
The store's right down the street.
There is a hardware store right down the street?
Hey, you guys? Okay, we've got great news.
Phoebe and I are moving in together.
Congratulations.
I know, it's so exciting. You know, I've never lived with a guy before.
Well, it's just like living with a girl,
only they don't steal your makeup.
Unless they're playing
''This Is What My Sister Would Look Like.''
Yeah, she's not so cute.
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
Well, you put down the toilet seat.
Yes, dear.
Is that a bit you guys do?
Uh-huh. We're playing you two.
We don't do that.
Tell her we don't do that.
Yes, dear.
I can't believe you're moving in together.
I'm happy for you guys.
I hear wedding bells.
Monica, slow down, okay?
I'm just excited to be living with him.
You know, I mean, I don't know...
...can I see someday being married to Mike?
Sure. Yeah.
I could picture myself
walking down the aisle in a wedding dress...
.that highlights my breasts
in an obvious yet classy way.
But do I want
that house in Connecticut near
the good schools...
...where Mike and I could
send little Sophie and Mike Jr.?
Oh, my God, I do.
I had no idea you were so conventional.
I know. I guess I am.
Oh, my God, load up the Volvo,
I want to be a soccer mom.
You ready to go?
Yeah, you bet, roomie.
Don't you mean ''groomie''?
- What are you talking about?  - Please.
These guys. We haven't even moved in yet,
and they have us picking out china patterns.
China patterns!
This is easy. ''Can't do this....''
Wow, seriously. Can't do this.
- Hey, Joe.  - Hey.
Look, I need to ask you a favor,
and we can't tell Monica anything about it.
I thought you guys didn't have secrets.
That will remain the official party line.
Look, Monica and I are having a little financial trouble.
Yeah, I know.
What? How do you know?
I just figured it out, you know?
I mean, you're not working, and the economy is bad.
Oh, right.
That is the fastest I have ever thought.
Anyway...
I need to borrow some money.
Oh, sure. Yeah, how much? Two thousand dollars?
Yes, $2000 exactly.
How did you know that?
I know how much you used to make,
and I know how much your rent is.
Oh, okay.
I am on fire.
Listen, this is really nice.
Did you write a check
to Monica for $2000?
Did Monica borrow money from you?
Kind of.
I can't believe her.
Did she tell you we were having money problems?
No, no, no. It wasn't because of your money problems.
It was for something for her.
What?
Something personal.
What would she get for $2000
that she wouldn't tell me about?
Excuse me.
Boob job.
A boob job? She doesn't need that.
That's crazy.
Well, it's not that crazy, okay?
Making them smaller, that would be crazy.
Oh, hey, I wanted to ask you about
Monica's little ''groomie'' joke.
Well, I think the reason people laughed is
that it's a play on the word ''roomie.''
I get the joke. Sophisticated as it was.
No, the thing I want to say is....
Maybe we should've talked about this before.
Us living together,
you're not expecting a proposal, right?
- Oh, no, no. Not at all.  - Okay.
We're just moving in right now.
We'll see where it goes.
Yeah, well, that's the thing.
For me, it's as far as it can ever go.
What do you mean?
Look, Phoebe, I....
I love you very much. But I never want to get married again.
It's just, my first marriage was...
you know, such a disaster that I kind of lost faith in the whole idea.
Was it that bad?
At one point, near the end...
she deliberately defecated on my
Okay, well, that's bad. Yeah.
But don't you think it might be different
with someone else? Perhaps...
a blond
who always uses the toilet?
Except for once in the ocean.
Look, it's not about who I would marry.
I was certain the first time I got married
it'd last forever. I was wrong.
But, it just
Look, Phoebe, it's not about you.
I just never want to get married again.
I'm sorry.
Are you okay with that? If not,
maybe us moving in together isn't the best idea.
No. Oh, I definitely don't want to get married.
I just wanted to make sure you didn't want to, too.
Because if we move in
and you start changing your mind...
...there is gonna be hell to pay, mister.
Trust me. I will never
Yeah, I get that. Yeah.
Hi. So you gave in and decided to call someone?
Yeah. I don't know who I was kidding.
I can barely use chopsticks.
- You're all set.  - Oh, thank you so much.
Wait. You forgot your...
...game.
Thank you.
Hey, Rach.
There she is, my perfectly proportioned wife.
Don't look at me. I never get his jokes.
- Thank you?   -No, no. Don't thank me.
Thank you. Do you know
there is not one thing I would change about you?
Not one single thing. And definitely not...
two single things.
Okay, you're being weird.
Do you want sex, or did you do something bad?
No. No. No. I just love the way you look. I am warm
for your form.
Okay, you know the old classics like, you know, ''You look nice''?
They're still okay.
But ''you look nice'' could mean that I'm saying,
''Your face looks nice.''
I want to compliment your body.
I mean, I wouldn't change it at all.
And more specifically,
I wouldn't want anything to get any bigger.
- Okay.  - I mean...
...you wouldn't want any part of me to get any bigger,
would you?
Don't answer that.
Just when you thought that dude couldn't get any weirder.
Why do you think he was so worried about me getting bigger?
I don't know. I mean, what brought that on?
Oh, my God. You know what, we're trying to get pregnant...
...so he's probably starting to freak out that my body's gonna change.
You think that's what it is?
You heard him.
''No bigger. You're perfect.
Just don't get any bigger.''
My God, he sounded just like
my high-school wrestling coach.
I'm gonna have to talk to Chandler.
Yeah. If you don't, I will.
Of course your body's gonna change.
Your breasts are gonna get bigger...
...your ass is gonna get bigger...
.you're gonna lose bladder control.
God, it's just such a magical time.
Hi. Listen, I wanted to ask you something about marriage.
Oh, great. Now you're seeking me out to make jokes?
I mean, I can see
if we're all hanging out,
but to come to my home....
No, I really want to know how you feel about it.
Why?
Mike doesn't ever want to get married.
- Never? - Never.
Wow. Are you still gonna move in with him?
I want to, but I wanted you to tell me
that marriage really isn't that big a deal.
You know, that I won't be missing out on anything.
That marriage stinks.
Yeah, marriage stinks.
I mean, if you want to see
a man gain weight and a woman stop shaving
get them married.
That's not how you really feel, is it?
No, I'm sorry.
I know it's not what you want to hear,
but I can't help it. I love marriage.
Seriously, you? ''Divorce-o''?
If you have to call me a name,
I'd prefer ''Ross, the Divorcer.''
It's just cooler.
Look, I know my marriages didn't exactly work out...
but, you know, I loved being that committed to another person.
And Carol and I had some good times
before she became a lesbian.
And once afterward.
Anyway, I'm sorry.
It's okay. That's how you feel.
But, come on, I mean, living together will be great.
I mean, you guys have so much fun.
And you love Mike.
I do love Mike.
Yeah, see?
And you were so excited about moving in together before...
...and you know what, you should be.
It's a big deal.
Yeah, I guess you're right.
Yeah, thanks. This helped. Thanks.
The Divorcer to the rescue.
- It's not cooler.  - Yeah, I just heard it.
Rach?
Rachel?!
So I can't do anything I like?!
Hey, Rach.
Perfection. Wouldn't change a thing. Not a thing.
- Honey?  - Yeah?
About that.
I'm going to change.
Yes, but, honey, you don't have to.
I'm gonna get bigger.
Honey, I....
I love your breasts the way they are.
Fascist.
My breasts are gonna get bigger
whether you like it or not.
And it's not just my breasts.
My ass is gonna get bigger too.
Your ass?!
And don't be surprised if her hands and her feet get bigger too.
- They do that?  - It's kind of a package deal.
God, why?
Why would you want to do that to yourself?
I thought it was something that we both wanted.
If it means that much to you,
I may be able to get onboard with the boobs...
but the giant ass and the big clown feet?
Oh, my God, Chandler.
If you can't handle this,
what will you be like in the hospital...
...with the blood and screaming
and the little person that's shooting out of her?
What?
Joey, why did you tell Chandler
that Monica was getting a boob job?
Because she is.
Chandler knows I borrowed the money.
For your boob job.
- Joe... - It's over.
Okay, so I'm out $4000
and nobody's boobs are getting any bigger?
Hey. Hey, what do you guys think about this:
Ross, the Divorce Force.
- Better.  - Yeah?
Very cool.
Hey, Pheebs? You know, I'm really glad
you came to talk to me the other day...
...and I hope I was a little helpful.
Yeah, you were helpful.
- Yeah. No, thank you.  - Good. Good.
Because the more I thought about it, the more I realized...
...I don't think marriage is necessarily the right path for you.
What do you mean?
I know the other day in the coffeehouse...
you were all caught up in the whole soccer-mom thing...
...but is that really you?
I mean, can you honestly picture yourself in a Volvo?
They are awfully boxy.
I mean, I don't know, you'd be so bored with marriage.
I mean, it's so normal.
Yeah.
Hey, can I help?
Well, we climbed up four flights of stairs,
maneuvered a narrow hallway...
dodged a rabid pit bull.
But these last three feet are where it gets really tricky.
You know, sometimes your words, they hurt.
Hey, where do you guys want this?
Yeah, seriously, because this is really heavy.
I mean, not for me, because I'm only
pretending to hold it, but for these guys.
Just one last time on the marriage thing.
There's no wiggle room?
None at all?
No, but you don't want to get married either, right?
Right.
Except that I do want to get married.
Couldn't have had this conversation down at the truck, huh?
What? You want to get married?
Someday.
And...hernia.
I haven't had a normal life.
And I never felt like I was missing out on anything.
But it feels like now it's my turn
to have some of the regular stuff.
Why didn't you say something before?
I didn't know how much I wanted it.
And I love you, and I wanted to live with you.
I want to live with you too. I mean, let's do that.
But I don't think I can.
It was okay to move in
when I didn't know what was gonna happen.
But I can't move in knowing nothing is
ever gonna happen.
Can we at least try living together?
You might change your mind about marriage.
Are you gonna change yours?
No.
Me neither.
I think I need to be with someone who wants what I want.
But I don't want this to end.
No, I don't want it to end either.
I can't believe this is gonna end.
I guess I'll have my stuff picked up.
Yeah. Okay.
Okay, so....
Goodbye.
- Take it easy, Mike.  - Bye, Mike.
I'm so sorry, Pheebs.
We're all sorry.
Look on the bright side.
At least you won't have to live with this ugly chair.
That was here already, huh?
I love you.
I did it! I did it!
All right.
I'd better take all I can carry.
Who knows when I'll be able to get in here again, huh?
You ready to go?
Let me just finish this.
Hey, Ross. Check this out.
Yeah, I can't do that.
What are you doing?
Have you seen this?
It's our new alumni website for college.
You can post messages for people,
let everyone know what you're up to.
Oh, great. A faster way to tell people
that I'm unemployed and childless.
It's actually interesting to find out what people are doing.
Remember Andrea Rich?
That tall girl that wouldn't sleep with you?
Well, her Internet company went under,
and she lost an ear in a boating accident.
Bet she'd sleep with you now.
No, I already e-mailed her.
Let me see what you wrote about yourself.
Doctor of paleontology, two kids.
Wait a second. You split with Carol
because you had different interests?
I think you split with Carol
because you had one very similar interest.
I'm gonna finish this later, okay? Let me just grab my coat.
Okay!
What, did you think you learned how to do it in the last two minutes?
Maybe we finish this for him.
Also, I cloned a dinosaur in my lab.
She is now my girlfriend.
I don't care what society says,
it's the best sex I've ever had.
And send.
No, no-- You can't do that to him.
- All right, let's go.  - Dude!
I think you made it clear you can't be trusted
with the ball inside the house.
And send.
Friends S09E17 The One With The Memorial Service
Hey. How was basketball?
It was fun.
Right up until Chandler got a finger in the eye.
Oh, no! Who did that?
Chandler. Yeah.
Hey!
- Rach?  - Yeah?
What's Huggsy doing in the crib with Emma?
She was just crawling around and found him,
so I just let her sleep with him.
- That's all right, isn't it?  - Of course. Yeah.
It's a stuffed animal, you know?
It's for kids. Not for adults.
I know that.
Joey, you're sure? I mean, I know how much you love him.
Rachel, let's be clear on this, okay?
I do not love Huggsy.
I like him a normal amount.
All right. Well, Emma loves him.
Yeah. Well, why wouldn't she? He's a wonderful person!
- Hi.  - Hey, Phoebe. How you doing?
- You feeling better?  - Breaking up sucks.
- Oh, I really miss Mike.  - Oh, I'm so sorry.
I've tried everything to feel better.
I even tried writing a song about it...
but I can't think of anything that rhymes with:
Hey, Monica, I'm gonna need your help getting through this.
You're saying you're not gonna need my help?
No. When I get to the point where I'm ready...
...to hear cruel, mocking jokes about Mike,
I'm gonna come to you.
Oh, good, because I've already thought of three.
Four! I just thought of a fourth!
Okay. I mean, I know I did the right thing.
Mike never wants to get married...
...and I shouldn't be in a relationship that has no future.
But pretty soon, I'm gonna miss him so much...
...I'm gonna want to see him again,
and you have to stop me.
Okay, you got it.
Unless.... Am I being too crazy about this?
All right, so there's no future.
But that doesn't mean we still can't have fun.
You know what? Forget what I said.
Really?
All right, if that's what you want.
That was a test, and you just failed.
Damn it! Rookie mistake!
I have sex with dinosaurs?
I believe I read that somewhere.
Not only is it not funny,
it's physically impossible! Okay?
Depending on the species,
I'd have to have a 6-foot-long--
It's not funny!
I respectfully disagree.
I can't believe you put that
on my alumni page.
Who cares? Nobody reads those.
You better hope not...
...because I just read what you put on your page today.
I don't have a page.
Oh, I respectfully disagree!
Look at you. All sweet and innocent,
sleeping like an angel.
With Emma's chubby little hands wrapped around you.
It's okay, Emma. You stay asleep.
Step away from the crib! I have a weapon!
It's okay! It's okay, Rach! It's me!
Put down the scrunchie.
What are you doing?
Well, I heard Emma stirring...
...so I came in to make sure
she could reach Huggsy.
Oh, thanks. All right, well, now that I'm up, I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
Okay, there you go, sweetie.
This isn't over!
Wait a second. Why would Ross tell everyone in your class
that you are ''as gay as the day is long''?
Because I told everyone he slept with dinosaurs.
Well, that's clearly a joke.
This could easily be true.
Would you get that, please?
People have been calling to congratulate me all day.
Hello?
No, he's not here. Yeah, this is his wife.
Yeah. Well, it came as quite a shock to me too!
Well, I guess I should've known.
He just kept making me watch Moulin Rouge.
Hang up! Hang up!
And that was a great movie.
I'm so gonna get back at Ross.
Oh, yeah, this'll show him. Here we go.
What are you doing?
Oh, you'll see, my friend!
I'm dead?
And so young.
Posting that I died? That really isn't funny.
Well, how you died was funny.
Oh, please. Hit by a blimp?
It kills over one Americans every year.
Unbelievable. My classmates are gonna think I'm dead.
My professors.
My parents are gonna get phone calls!
You're messing with people's feelings here.
You wanna talk about people's feelings?
You should have heard how hurt
Professor Stern was when I told him
I wouldn't be able to go to Key West!
You've really crossed a line here. But that's okay.
Because I'm on my way to buy some Photoshop software...
...and a stack of gay porn.
That's right. Your coming-out is about to get real graphic!
God, I wish Mike were here.
Okay, if Mike were here,
what would the two of you be doing?
What are you, animals? It's 4:00 in the afternoon.
I gotta call him.
Just to talk to him. There's no harm in that.
That's how it starts.
''I don't need to eat the cake, I'll just smell the icing.
Why not just a little sliver?''
Or, ''Okay, just a slice or two.''
The next thing you know, you're 210 pounds...
...and you get wedged in going down the tunnel slide!
Phoebe, honey, I know this is hard.
But look, if you talk to him,
then you're gonna want to see him.
And if you see him, you're gonna wanna get back together.
And I know that's not what you want.
All right, so give me your phone.
Here.
- And now your cell.  - Okay.
There you go.
- This is your cell phone?  - Yes.
This is your current cell phone?
Yes. It reminds me of a simpler time.
Phoebe? Where's your purse?
- Hey! No!  - No!
- Give it to me!  - You can't have it!
- Give it to me!  - No!
- I'll go in there!  - Oh, yeah.
- Phoebe, come here!  - No!
- Give it to me!  - You're crazy!
Damn you, Monica Geller hyphen Bing!
Hey, look who's here.
It's Joey. And he brought home a friend.
Joey! Emma's right here.
You promised not to bring girls home in the middle of the day!
No, no, no, it's not a girl. It's...
...a brand-new Huggsy!
Oh! Oh, that's so great! Now Emma has two Huggsies!
No, no. Oh, no. No, Emma has one Huggsy.
The new Huggsy.
The other Huggsy,
I don't know, I guess I'll just take him back.
You know what? When I was a little girl,
I had a little pink pony named Cotton.
Oh, I loved her so much.
I took her everywhere.
I would braid her tail--
Make the transfer!
Should I be concerned that a button
fell off the old Huggsy
and I can't find it?
No, don't worry about it. I swallowed that years ago. Hey!
Oh, what? I don't think she likes the new Huggsy.
But he's the same.
I think she wants the old one back.
Yeah, but he's the same.
Joey, come on.
But he's the same!
You're not the same.
You know, it's a lot less surprising to do that
after I've buzzed you into the building.
So, Phoebe, why are there men's shoes by the door?
Those are my shoes.
Well, when you get over this breakup, we need to go shopping.
Look, Monica,
I really appreciate you checking in on me.
- But I'm actually feeling a lot better.  - You are?
Yeah, I just kind of want to be alone right now.
- Who's that?  - I ordered Chinese food.
What are the chances?!
One billion Chinese people, and they send Mike!
What are you doing here?
Phoebe called me.
- Phoebe!  - I'm sorry. I broke down.
I wanted to see him.
Damn it, Phoebe,
how did you even call him?
There's a speakerphone on the base unit.
Base unit. Think, Monica, think!
Look, if I want to see Phoebe, and she--
This doesn't concern you!
Sorry. I guess I was thrown off by the mention of my name.
Look, guys, you can't do this.
It's gonna make getting over each other harder.
Not if nothing happens.
Why can't we just hang out as friends?
Sure. If you're just gonna hang out as friends,
then maybe I'll join you.
You know, I'm your friend and Mike's friend.
Sit down.
Make room for your friend.
So how have you been?
I've been pretty good.
You look really beautiful.
Thanks. You look good too.
No, no, no. This is dangerous territory. Keep it clean.
So how's the piano playing going?
Actually, I've been playing a lot of love songs lately.
- I've missed you.  - I've missed you too.
You know, on the way over here,
I saw this drunk guy throw up.
And then a pigeon ate it.
Hey. Ross.
Look, I just wanted to apologize.
Don't tell me you actually made those gay pictures of me.
Check this out.
So that's what I'd look like if I worked out.
And was being serviced by a policeman.
You're not gonna actually send these out, are you?
Actually, I don't need to, because your little ''Ross is dead'' joke
didn't work.
Okay? There were no responses.
Nobody posted anything on the website,
nobody called my parents,
so the joke is on you.
Nobody called, nobody wrote anything,
nobody cares that I'm dead.
Oh, my God.
Nobody cares that I'm dead?
Oh, come on, you know that's not true.
What are you talking about? You get 60 responses...
just for coming out of the closet.
I didn't get one response, and I'm dead!
Well, the gay community is a lot more vocal than the dead community.
I can't believe this. Not even my geology lab partner.
And I carried that guy!
Look, let's think about this, okay?
You think people are gonna disturb your family
at this tragic time?
That people are gonna post condolences on a website?
This isn't about people not caring.
This is about people not having a decent outlet for their grief.
- You're right. There isn't a decent outlet.  - Right.
I'm sure if you had a funeral or memorial service, tons of people would come.
Exactly!
Ross, what are you doing?
You're having a memorial service for yourself?
No, that would be stupid. You're having it for me.
Ross, don't press send. Don't press--
No, too late. Too late. It's sent.
Sorry, so is that picture of you and the policeman.
I'm trying to put Emma down for a nap.
Have you seen Huggsy?
Original or crappy?
- Original.  - No. Sorry. Haven't seen him.
Then what's that big lump under your covers?
It's Monica, okay?
That's not Monica!
All right, fine! It's original Huggsy!
I know Emma wants him,
but he's mine and I need him.
She's being unreasonable.
Joey, there is a reason that Emma loves that stupid penguin so much!
Oh, don't cover its ears!
It's because it reminds her of her Uncle Joey.
- It does?  - Yeah.
And she's comforted by him
because she loves her Uncle Joey so much.
- Really? She loves me?  - Oh, yeah.
But you know what?
If you need Huggsy, don't worry.
Emma will totally understand. I won't, but whatever.
Okay, wait a minute, Rach. I mean, if....
If Huggsy means that much to Emma, then....
Well, she can have him.
Oh, sweet, I knew Uncle Joey would step up.
Look, Emma. Look who's back.
No, forget it! Forget it! I can't do it!
Are you--? You're gonna take Huggsy away from a little child?
How do you think
I got him in the first place?
All right, you two. I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
I don't want anything going on while I'm gone.
Here's a few things you can discuss:
Mucus, fungus, and the idea of me and Ross doing it.
I've missed you so much.
I won't ask you to get back together.
I know we want different things, but....
Just to be with you one more night.
I want that too.
But is that gonna make it too hard?
It can't be any harder than this.
I mean, if  had known the last time I saw you
would be the last time, I--
I would have stopped to memorize your face,
the way you moved.
Everything about you.
If I had known the last time I kissed you would be the last time...
I never would have stopped.
Kiss him, you fool!
- What?  - Didn't you hear that speech?
If you don't kiss him, then I will.
I missed you so much.
- I knew you'd be here!  -Crap.
- Who is this?  - My friend Manny.
I asked him to keep me away from you.
Hey, that's what I'm doing for Phoebe.
Well, you're not doing a very good job.
- Excuse me?  - What's with the kissing?
Hey, at least I knew where my guy was.
Yeah, thank God
you were here to oversee all the kissing.
You didn't hear the speech.
I've heard the speech.
If he knew it was gonna be the last time--
Hey, it was very moving. You're just heartless!
- You're weak!  -You're weird!
Your pants are undone.
Where'd they go?
- Damn it.  - Well, we blew it.
I blame myself.
And I blame you too.
It's been an hour,
and not one of my classmates has shown up?
I tell you, when I actually die,
some people are gonna get seriously haunted.
There you go. Someone came.
Okay. Okay. I'm gonna go hide.
This is so exciting. My first mourner!
Hi. Glad you could come.
Please come in.
Hi. You're Chandler Bing, right?
I'm Tom Gordon. I was in your class.
Oh, yes. Yes, let me take your coat.
Thanks. I'm so sorry about Ross, it's....
No, at least he died doing what he loved.
Watching blimps.
Who is it?
You know some guy, Tom Gordon?
I don't remember him.
But then again, I touched so many lives.
So did you know Ross well?
Actually, I barely knew him.
I came because I heard Chandler's news.
Do you know if he's seeing anyone?
Yes, he is. Me.
What? You mean--?
Can I ask you a personal question?
How do you shave your beard so close?
Okay, Tommy! That's enough mourning for you.
Here we go. Bye-bye. All right.
- Hey, listen. Call me.  - Okay.
I'm dead and no one cares?
I look like a man?
Please, one ridiculous problem at a time.
This isn't ridiculous. Look around, no one's here.
You gave them one day's notice.
Not everyone checks the website every day.
And Monica, it's probably the way you stand!
I guess you're right.
Still, somebody must have seen it.
I went to that school for four years
and I didn't have an impact on anyone?
Well, that's not true. You had an impact on me.
I mean, it's 15 years later
and we're still best friends.
Doesn't that count for something?
Oh, great, more party boys for Chandler.
I'm sure it's somebody for you. Now go hide.
Hi. I'm here for Ross Geller's memorial service.
- Kori? Kori Weston?  - Yeah.
- You look amazing.  - And you are?
Chandler. Chandler Bing.
And I'm not gay. I'm not gay at all.
You are married, though.
Don't listen to him. He's in a really bad mood.
I can't believe that Ross is gone. It is just so sad.
I didn't know Ross and you were so close.
Oh, we weren't. But we had one class together.
He was such a great guy.
And he talked so passionately about science.
I always remembered him.
I'm sure that would mean a lot to him.
And if heaven has a door...
...I'm sure he's pressing his ear up against it and listening intently.
I thought so many times about calling him and asking him out.
I guess I really missed my chance.
No, you didn't!
I'm still alive!
Kori, I know this is a big surprise for you.
It's a long story.
But the things you just said
really made my day.
The fact that you're here means more to me...
...than if this room were filled with people.
You sick freak! Who does that?
I can't believe I had a crush on you.
Did you hear that?
Kori Weston had a crush on me!
No, Mom, I am not dead.
I know it's not something to kid about.
It was just a practical joke between Chandler and me,
but it's over, okay?
Actually, no. Even if I had died,
you would not be left childless.
Monica?
Monica? Hey, can I borrow the Porsche?
- Okay.  - All right!
But what is it not?
A place to entertain my lady friends.
And what else is it not?
A place to eat spaghetti.
Very good. What do you need it for anyway?
The Powerball lottery is up to 300 million...
and they don't sell tickets here.
So you're driving up to Connecticut?
Yeah, Connecticut. Not West Virginia.
Maybe I'll drive you up there.
I'd like to buy some tickets myself.
Yeah, with Chandler not getting paid, we could really use $300 million.
Yes, because if I was at my old job,
we'd say, ''300 million? No, thank you.''
Will you get me tickets too?
Yeah, me too.
- Sure.  - I have an idea.
Why don't we all pitch in 50 bucks, we'll pool our money together...
and then if we win, we'll split it.
That's a great idea!
No, thanks.
You don't wanna win the lottery?
Sure I do.
I also want to be king of my own country...
...and find out what happened to Amelia Earhart.
Still on Amelia Earhart?
The woman just vanished!
Seriously, you don't want in on this?
No. Do you know what
your odds are of winning the lottery?
I mean, you have a better chance of being struck by lightning 42 times.
But there's six of us,
so we'd only have to get struck 7 times.
I like those odds!
Seriously, you guys, I can't believe
you're gonna spend $250 on the lottery.
I mean, that's such a bunch of boo-hockey.
I'll ask.
''Boo-hockey''?
Oh, we think Emma's about to start talking...
...so we're trying to be careful about what words we use in front of her.
So get ready to hear a lot of boo-hockey...
...gosh darn it and brother pucker.
How do you know she's gonna start talking?
When I talk to her,
I almost feel like she understands what I'm saying.
Kind of like Joey.
What's that now?
Friends S09E18 The One With The Lottery
God, look at all these tickets. It's so exciting.
I haven't won anything
since sixth grade.
Pie-eating contest?
You assume because I was heavy
that's the only way I could win something?
No, I saw a picture of you covered in blueberries.
- That was a good day.  - Yeah.
They're towing your car!
I'm parked in a garage on Morton.
They're towing a car.
And I am seeing spots.
Ross, you don't have Emma!
Rachel, you don't have Emma!
Where's Emma? Who has Emma?
Joey, relax.
My mother picked her up two hours ago. You were there.
I was?
Yes, and you talked to her.
- I did?  - She dropped off a casserole.
Oh, yeah, the casserole lady.
Did you come by to watch us win the big bucks?
Yeah. And then I figured after you win,
we can all go out to the balcony...
and see a night rainbow with gremlins dancing on top of it.
Don't touch the phone! I'll get it!
- You think he washed his hands?  - Hello?
Hey, Charlie, what do you know?
What's going on?
Chandler's supposed to find out
if he's getting a job at his agency.
But out of 15 interns,
they're only hiring three.
- Tough odds.  - Yeah.
If only it were a sure thing
like your 24-state lottery.
Yeah, look who's coming around!
Damn it. All right, call me when you know more.
- Did you get it?  - One of the slots got filled.
- By you?  - Sense the tone.
No, that kid Nate got it.
Oh, I hate that guy.
I mean, come on,
kid, pull up your pants!
Well, there's two spots left, right?
Yeah. I mean, I want this so much. I wanna get one.
I want my friend Charlie to get one.
Except I don't care about Charlie.
- Hey, you guys.  - Hey!
You are not gonna believe this.
I just saw my psychic.
and she said I was definitely gonna win the lottery tonight!
That's reminds me.I thought we could use some extra luck...
...so I brought a wishbone home from work.
A psychic and a wishbone?
Guys, give someone else a chance.
All right, who wants to do it?
Can I?
Vegetarians never get to do the wishbone.
It's really not fair. Just because we don't eat the meat...
...doesn't mean we don't like to play with the carcasses.
All right. Rach?
I don't want that turkey smell all over my hands.
I'll do it! It'll get the casserole stink off of mine.
- I hope I win.  - Well, it doesn't really matter.
You're both wishing for the same thing.
I can't tell you what I'm wishing for,
or else, you know, it won't come true.
Right. But we know what you're wishing for.
- I can't really say.  - I understand.
But you're wishing for what we think, aren't you?
I'm not really comfortable with these questions!
- Please!  - Just do it!
Okay. One, two, three.
I won! Hey!
You know what?
I'm sure your wish is gonna come true.
But, you guys, just in case,
maybe a genie will come out if we rub this lamp.
That thing gets hot!
Ross, just keep making your jokes.
How are you gonna feel if we actually do win?
You're not gonna win.
I know the odds are against us...
...but somebody has to win,
and it could be us. And then how you gonna feel?
We're gonna be like, ''Everybody, let's take our helicopters up to the Cape.''
And you're gonna be all, like, ''Oh, I can't, guys.
I'll have to meet you up there. I gotta gas up the Hyundai.''
Okay, I've heard myself on tape,
and I sound nothing like that.
I can see the headline now:
''Lottery Winners' Friend,
Filled With Regret, Eats Own Arm.''
Why would I eat my own arm?
Well, you wouldn't,
but we own the paper. We can print whatever we want.
You know what? I'm gonna throw in 50 bucks for you.
- Why?  - Because I know that you think...
that the lottery is boo-hockey...
...but we're all here, and we're gonna watch the numbers and have fun.
And you're my brother, and I want you to be a part of this.
You don't have to do that. I mean, I'll pay for myself.
But just the fact that you want me to have fun with you guys,
that's so sweet.
Come here.
Get a room.
So now that you're in,
what are you gonna do if we win?
I don't know. I'll probably just invest it.
Calm down.
Seriously, that's your fantasy?
To invest it?
Oh, I'm sorry. Did I say, ''invest it''?
I meant, ''Be cool and piss it all away.''
I know! We should pool all our money
and buy the Knicks!
I don't really care about the Knicks.
You will when I pick you as starting forward.
You would do that? I never get picked!
I'm not sure a sports team is the way to go.
You won't let me buy the Knicks?
I can't believe you're taking this away.
You're right, it has been your dream for over 15 seconds.
How long until they announce the numbers, Mommy?
I'll take this one too. ''Mommy''?
Oh, I've gotten into the habit of calling Rachel...
...''Mommy'' when we're around Emma.
Which I now realize we are not.
I'm hoping that if she hears it enough, it'll be her first word.
Although if we're gonna do that,
we should probably call me ''Daddy'' too.
I like that, Daddy.
I was just talking about Rachel.
Is Daddy getting angry?
Is Daddy gonna spank me?
Well, that depends.
Have you been a bad--?
No, I can't.
Hello? Hello? Hey, Charlie. Did anybody else hear?
What? Susan got it? How?
Oh, man, I would've slept with him!
All right, bye.
Dude, I'm sorry. But hey,
there's one spot left, right?
Well, Charlie's gonna get that.
Hey, don't say that.
You've got just as good a chance of getting that job.
He is the boss' son.
- Come on, lottery!  - Yeah!
It starts in, like, 20 minutes.
Okay, here we go.
We need to sort through the tickets quickly to see if we've won.
So does anybody have any ideas how to organize this?
Okay, how about this:
We divide them into six groups of 40.
The remaining 10 can be read by whoever finishes first.
I have another idea.
I'm sorry, idea time is over.
- Well, are all the tickets in the bowl?  - Yeah.
What about the ones on the nightstand?
There are no tickets there.
Yes, there are. I just saw them a few minutes ago.
No, you didn't. You must be mistaken.
There are 20 tickets on the nightstand.
Chandler, sense the tone.
Well, well, well. Look what Mommy found.
Okay, fine. I bought 20 extra tickets for me and Chandler.
The psychic also said that I would be betrayed.
I can't believe this. I thought we were all in this together.
Hey, you just got in five minutes ago!
Three minutes ago!
I don't know why that's important.
I was with you the whole time.
When did you even get those?
When you were reading the dirty magazines without taking off the plastic.
I'll show you how.
Okay. Well, Monica,
suppose one of your special tickets wins?
How are you gonna feel when you win and lose your friends?
Please. If I win the lottery,
you guys are not gonna leave me.
Someone gave me muffins last week,
and I couldn't get rid of you for three days!
Chandler, would you just tell her what she did was wrong?
She's right.
You shouldn't have bought tickets just for us.
Let me finish.
However, it doesn't look like I'm gonna get this job...
...so I can't afford to have principles.
So screw you! The tickets are ours!
There's the man I married.
All right. Believe me, if you win the lottery
it's the last you're gonna hear from us.
Fine. Don't be my friends.
I'll buy new friends.
Yeah, and then I'll pay for their plastic surgery
so they look just like you!
You know what? I want my share of the tickets.
I want my tickets too!
And I'm buying the Knicks!
And Steffi Graf!
Cool. Then I want mine too!
And if I win...
I'm gonna put it all into a very low-yield bond!
No. You guys, we gotta keep all the tickets together.
No. No, we should divide them up...
...and I should get extra
because we used my car!
Hey! Hey! If anybody gets extra tickets,
it should be me!
This whole thing was my idea!
Yeah. Thanks for inventing the lottery!
Just give them to me, and I'll split them up!
Hey, hey!
God, I can't take it anymore!
I'm putting an end to this!
Okay, if she jumps, I get her tickets!
Wait, no, no! Hey!
If we're not doing this together, we're not doing it at all.
Say goodbye to your tickets.
No! No! No!
Do not come any closer!
Can I come a little bit closer?
Valuable things are getting squished.
Now, what's more important,
your friends or money?
- Friends!  - Money!
Friends.
Hey, Monica, what about your extra tickets?
They're all in there.
Even these five that I hid in my bra.
Monica!
Okay. Good. You guys were so scared.
There is no way I was gonna dump this--
God! No!
I think I broke your bowl.
Go! Go! Go!
What a beautiful night to be running around the street, looking for tickets.
And the wind sure made it fun.
Phoebe, we lost half of them.
So what?
Monica, we have the winning ticket.
My psychic said I was gonna win, remember?
Weird your psychic didn't mention
anything about the scary pigeon.
As a matter of fact, she said that's how I'm going to die.
So excuse me for being a little skittish.
There's two messages. This could be from work.
- Oh, play them.  - Okay. Here we go.
Hello. This is the pigeon from the balcony
calling to apologize.
I shouldn't have knocked the tickets
out of the pretty lady's hand.
It was all my fault. Not hers. Bye.
Well, I bet that was very hard for him to do.
Hey, Chandler, it's Charlie.
This is it.
Listen, it turns out I got the last spot.
I'm really sorry, man. It was a lot of fun working with you.
Give me a call if you want.
Gosh, I'm so sorry, honey.
Sorry, Chandler.
It is so unfair. It's like that time
they promoted Saundra over me at work.
Was she related to Ralph Lauren?
No, she was just much better at her job than me.
You guys, the drawing's about to start.
We should call my mom's
and say good night to Emma...
- before she goes down.  - Good idea.
Honey, you're being really strong about this.
I know how badly you wanted that job.
Yeah, you know, I really thought I deserved it.
But let's go win the lottery.
I mean, we still have a 130 chances to win, right?
Hundred and thirty-one.
Yeah, good night, sweetheart. I love you.
And remember, you're Daddy's little girl.
Phoebe's totally ruined that for me.
Hi, Mom. Put her back on.
Rach, they're announcing the numbers!
My God, I can already feel myself changing.
Here are your official Powerball numbers. We have 53.
- I've got that.  - We have one too!
We are on the road, people!
Come on!
Mom, please,
I know you love your new lips,
but I can barely understand you.
Would you please just let me say good night to my daughter?
And here we go. The Powerball is seven.
All right, check your numbers! Make me rich.
You guys, you're not gonna believe this.
I was just saying good night to Emma,
and she said her first words.
- What?  - Well, what did she say?
She said, ''Gleba'' !
Make me rich!
Isn't that amazing?
Oh, yeah. No, no, no, that's great.
Why aren't you more excited?
Rach, gleba is not a word.
Well, of course it is.
Okay. What does it mean?
Well, I don't know all the words.
You know, I'm just glad I didn't miss my daughter's first word.
Yes you did! Gleba is a word!
Okay. Use it in a sentence.
Okay. Emma just said, ''Gleba.''
It's not a word.
Okay, fine. I'm gonna look it up.
Okay, great.
While you're at it, she said another word the other day.
Why don't you look up:
All right. Okay. Okay. Gleba...
Here it is! ''The fleshy, spore-bearing inner mass of a certain fungi.''
She's gonna be a scientist.
- Damn it. Anybody got anything?  - No.
I'm still looking through mine.
Just double-checking. No.
No. No.
No!
Hello? Hold on.
It's your boss.
The ''I'm sorry I rejected you'' phone call.
I'm not used to getting these from guys.
- Hey, Steve.  - Chandler, hi.
I'm sure you've heard we filled the three positions.
We felt that with your maturity and experience...
you wouldn't be happy being someone's assistant.
I'd love to be somebody's assistant. Answering phones...
...getting coffee, I live for that stuff.
And I'm not too mature.
Farts, boobies, butt cracks!
Chandler, you were the strongest person in the program.
We're offering you the position of junior copywriter.
Me? That guy who just said, ''butt cracks''?
Yes, that's right.
We're excited about the level of sophistication...
...you'll be bringing to the job.
Okay. Well, thanks, you won't regret it. I'll see you tomorrow.
What?
Oh, yeah, I'm gonna be a junior copywriter.
Congratulations! Oh, sweetie, I'm so proud of you.
Thanks. Does that mean I get the good loving tonight?
You bet. No TV or anything.
Hey, that is so great about the job.
Thanks, man.
I'd like to think I had something to do with it.
Really? Why?
Well, before with the wishbone.
I didn't wish we would win the lottery.
I wished you'd get the job.
Oh, yeah?
Listen, don't tell Monica. She'll rip your heart right out.
Well, you know what? There was a little part of me...
...that really thought we were gonna win.
Me too. So much for my
dinosaur/ Amelia Earhart theme park.
You guys? What was the Powerball number again?
- Seven.  - We won.
- What?  - We won!
-Let me see! Let me see! -Don't tear it!
Phoebe, you don't have any of the first five numbers!
I know that, but look, we got the Powerball number.
We won $3!
Wow, you think we should get that over 20 years
or go for the big payout?
I don't care. I've never won anything before.
I can't believe this!
So, Pheebs, what are you gonna do with your $3?
Well, it's not all mine.
We all get 50 cents.
You know what? You can have mine.
- Me too.  - Me too.
Me too.
Well, I guess if everybody else is.
Hey, guys. So I just called the Powerball hot line.
Can you believe it? Nobody won.
I beg to differ.
Maybe nobody won the jackpot,
but there was this guy in here earlier...
...and he found a ticket on the street right outside
and won $ 10,000.
Again, don't blame the pretty lady.
It was not her fault. It was me, the pigeon.
Seriously, stop staring at her.
God, you're beautiful.
Why are we fighting this?
You know you want it to happen as much as l do.
l want you. l need you.
Let me make love to you.
l don't wanna stand in the way of true love or anything...
...but l think a cantaloupe
might hurt less.
No, l'm rehearsing my lines.
They're giving me a romantic story
on Days of Our Lives.
lt's the first time my character's gotten one.
l'm nervous. l want it to be good.
l haven't seen you this worked-up
since you did that dog-food commercial...
...and you thought you were gonna be
with a real talking dog.
Yeah, that was a disappointment.
You wanna come down to the set and tell me if l'm doing okay?
- Are you serious? - Yeah.
You just have to promise not to get thrown out again.
- That was an honest mistake. - Right.
''Oh, my God. ls this the men's room? l feel so foolish.
Have you always known you wanted to be an actor?''
Yeah, that was an awesome day.
Friends S09E19 The One With Rachel's Dream
- Hey. - Hey.
So do you guys wanna come eat dinner
at the restaurant sometime in the next few weeks?
- Sure. - l'd love to.
Well, you can't.
We're booked solid for the next month.
Well, l can't give you a massage...
...because my license has been revoked again.
Phoebe, what happened?
Well, it was an accident, you know.
lt's a lot of oil
and sometimes the hand just slips.
Have l got a surprise for you.
Pack your bags.
Oh, no.
You guys aren't supposed to get divorced for seven years.
What? No, l'm taking Monica
to a romantic inn in Vermont.
Oh, good.
Okay, good for you. Trying to recapture the magic.
So what do you say? Can you get out of work?
Honey, l can't.
Things are crazy at the restaurant.
You're really that busy?
Yeah. l'm sorry, l really am.
That's okay. l'll just try and reschedule.
Hi, this is Chandler Bing.
l made a reservation there...
...and l need to change it.
What do you mean, it's nonrefundable?
Well, can l just come some other time?
Can't you make an exception?
Tell them l'm a chef
at a big New York restaurant.
Tell them that in two weeks,
l will once again be a masseuse in good standing.
Look, this is ridiculous.
l'm not paying for that room, okay?
Well, thank you very much.
Yeah, l'm going to Vermont.
Don't worry, use your travel insurance.
l don't have travel insurance.
Well, this is what happens
when people live on the edge.
Why don't you take Ross?
Don't you think that'll be a little weird?
l mean, two guys in a romantic inn?
No, not if the room has two beds.
l guess.
lt still seems a little-- ''Moonlight boat ride''?!
Joey,
is this the bed where Olivia lost her virginity?
l don't know, but one of the extras sure did.
Listen, Rach.
Thanks again for coming down to watch my scenes.
Please, honey.
Just the fact that you want me here to support you, l'm--
Oh, my God. ls that Christian Saunders?
He is so gorgeous!
And also, so gay.
Well, in my head,
he's done some pretty not-gay stuff.
Well, at the Christmas party,
him and Santa
did some definitely-gay stuff.
Joey? Joey, we're ready for you.
Okay. All right, wish me luck.
Okay. Not that you need it,
but good-- God! ls that Chase Lassiter?
He's straight, right?
Rach, I got to say, if you weren't here wondering...
...if these guys were gay,
l don't know if l could do this.
l'm sorry, you're right.
l'm sorry. Good luck.
On a bell, please. Quietly.
And action!
Drake, what are you doing here?
Stopping you from marrying the wrong man...
...and making the biggest mistake of your life.
Get out.
You don't love him.
What do you know about love?
l know what l felt that night
when we kissed under the bridge.
That kiss never happened.
Well, what about this one?
Now, l told you to get out.
Fine, l'll go.
But let me ask you one question.
You look real familiar. Have we--?
Shh! He's asking her a question.
Can you live the rest of your life
never knowing what we could have been?
l don't have a choice.
Yes, you do.
Yes, you do.
l'm the one who doesn't have a choice
because l....
Because l can't stop loving you.
Don't say that.
Tell me to stop.
Just...
...tell me to stop.
- Cut! - No!
Or, cut. You know, that's your call.
Everything was delicious.
Thank you.
lt was. The duck in particular was superb.
Thank you.
You haven't said anything.
Actually, l do have one small complaint.
Well, please, l welcome criticism.
The musician right outside the restaurant
is kind of a mood killer.
What musician?
And there's a country called Argentinaaaa,
it's a place I've never seeeeen.
But I'm told for fifty pesos you can buy a human spleen.
Humaaan spleeeeen. Ol?
What are you doing here?
You said you had customers lined up in the street,
so l'm here to entertain.
Great.
Yeah, it really has been great too.
They must have seen me play before...
...because they requested a bunch of my songs.
Yeah, ''You Suck'' ...
...and ''Shut Up and Go Home.''
Listen, Phoebe.
You know how much l love listening to your music...
...but....
But what?
This is kind of a classy place.
Okay, say no more.
It wasn't just that she was fat
the woman smelled like garbage!
Everyone!
It wasn't just that she was fat,
the woman smelled like garbaaaaaage!
Classy, huh?
Hi, Chandler Bing.
l have a reservation.
Welcome to the Chestnut lnn.
Where are you joining us from?
New York.
The Big Apple.
I'm sorry, he's a little wound up.
We had to stop at every maple-candy stand on the way here.
l ate all my gifts for everybody.
l'm sorry, there's no record of your reservation in the computer.
That's impossible.Can you check again, please.
Check again, please.
l'm sorry, it's not here.
lt's not there.
Let me get this straight.
l called to try to
cancel my reservation...
...was told it's not refundable.
Then we drove six hours all the way up here...
...and now we don't have a reservation?
l don't know what to say.
She doesn't know what to say.
Just give us the cheapest room you have.
The only thing we have available is our deluxe suite.
The rate is $600.
That's insane.
lt's totally insane.
Dude, let's drive home.
We'll hit all the maple-candy stores
on the way back...
...and if they're closed,
then maybe we'll tap a tree
and make some ourselves.
Does that room have a closet
l can lock him in?
We'll take it.
Great.
They are totally ripping us off!
Dude, don't worry about it.
l know how to make your money back.
This is a nice hotel.
Plenty of amenities.
We just load up on those.
Like those apples. lnstead of taking one...
...l take six.
Great. At $ 100 an apple, we're there.
Come on, you get the idea.
You know, we'll make our money back in no time.
Dude, you're shaking.
lt's the sugar.
Could you hold the apple?
- Hi. - Hey.
Joey, l gotta tell you,
l have been thinking all day about that scene you did.
l mean, you were amazing.
You know, the writing was good.
And the director's good.
And my costar's good.
But they're not as good as me!
You have to tell me what happens tomorrow.
l'm going over the script now.
Wanna read lines with me?
Me? Oh, l'm not an actress.
All right, l can ask Monica.
Screw her! That part is mine!
Okay, so just from the top of the page right here.
Okay.
Hello, Drake. l'm surprised to see you here.
l can't believe you married him.
Well, what choice did l have?
He was keeping my sister in a dungeon.
So, what about us?
Everything we feel for each other?
lt's over. You have to accept that.
How can l, knowing l'll never hold you
in my arms again...
...or touch your skin or feel your lips...
...knowing l'll never make love to you?
How can l accept
that l can never kiss you again...
...when it's all l can do
not to kiss you right now?
Kiss me.
What?
Kiss me.
Rach, it doesn't say that.
No, l'm saying it.
But--
Just don't talk.
Well, that's new.
Hi, this is Ross Geller in suite 206.
I think l've forgotten a couple of things.
Could you have some complimentary toiletries
sent up to my room?
Thank you. Okay, a toothbrush, toothpaste...
...razor, mouthwash, deodorant,
floss, Band-Aids, shaving cream, after-shave.
And l feel like l'm forgetting something.
ls there anything else you have that l haven't asked for already?
Yeah, go ahead, send up some tampons.
What'd you get?
USA Today.
Nice. Put it with the others.
And l also got two more apples.
We're four short of a bushel!
God, l feel so alive.
l love being in the country!
Also, got these great salt and pepper shakers...
...from the restaurant.
That's not cool.
Dude, none of this is cool.
Look, Chandler, you have to find the line between stealing...
...and taking what the hotel owes you.
For example: A hair dryer, no, no.
But shampoos and conditioners, yes, yes.
Now, the salt shaker is off limits.
But the salt....
l wish l'd thought this through.
l think l get what you mean, though.
Like, the lamp is the hotel's...
...but the bulbs-- Oh, you already got that.
Not my first time in a hotel, my friend.
Okay, how about this?
No, no, no.
You can't take the remote control.
Yes, but the batteries.
Thank you. Thank you very much.
Let's celebrate with some maple candy.
No!
At least tell me where you hid it.
- Can l ask you a question? - Yeah.
Have you ever had any...
...weird, romantic dreams?
Let me think.
When l was younger,
l used to dream that l got married to Mayor McCheese.
And on our wedding night, l ate his head.
Okay.
Well, this is like that...
...in no way.
l had a dream last night that l wanted to kiss Joey.
Wow! You mean like ''kiss him'' kiss him?
Oh, yeah. l mean, it was pretty intense.
- What brought that on? - l don't know.
Maybe it had to do with the fact l saw him do a love scene.
- A love scene? With who? - Olivia.
Olivia?!
l thought she was marrying Connor?!
Oh, right. Real life more important.
You think my dream means anything?
l don't know.
l mean, you saw him do a love scene.
So maybe you don't have a thing for Joey.
Maybe you have a thing for Drake.
Well, it was Joey reading
Drake's lines in the dream.
Of course it was. Trust me,
when it comes to psychology...
...l know what l'm talking about.
l took two psych classes in college.
You took the same class twice.
lt was hard!
l know.
Hey.
Hi, Phoebe.
Here, Monica,
look what l got to wear
when l play at your restaurant.
Wait.
Right? l think this might even class up
''The Ballad of the Uncircumcised Man.''
Phoebe...
...maybe l wasn't clear before.
l really love listening to your music here.
But my restaurant, it's sort of an upscale place.
Right, yeah, okay.
l'll ask the butler to fetch
my diamonds out of the vault.
Phoebe, it's not what you wear.
lt's sort of your songs.
l just don't think you should play at the restaurant anymore.
Okay. Fine, l'll just--
l'll take the hat back.
There.
Hey, so, you guys, the funniest thing happened at work the--
My songs aren't good enough for your restaurant?
Okay, we're still on that.
l didn't say they weren't good enough.
Then what's wrong with them?
What, they don't go with your
tiny portions of pretentious food?
- Tiny portions? - Yeah, well, ''Excuse me.
l ordered the smoked salmon appetizer,
but l can't see it. l can't see it.''
Phoebe, it's not about quantity.
Well, it's not about quality.
Oh, really? You wanna talk about quality?
Have you ever heard of a ''key''?
lt's what some people sing in.
Well, at least all my songs don't taste like garlic.
Yeah, there are other ingredients, Monica.
So that's what we're doing.
When l'm in a coffeehouse bopping along to one of your songs...
...l'm wearing earplugs.
Earplugs or cloves of garlic?
You know what? l take back what l said before.
Keep playing at the restaurant,
because with your music driving people inside...
...my bar sales have gone up like crazy.
What are people having, the garlic martini?
Here's your bill.
We hope you enjoyed your stay.
Oh, we did.
And you still have all your lamps.
l didn't factor in the room tax.
Dude, don't worry about it.
l found an unattended maid's cart.
We're way ahead of the game.
-Oh, my God. -What?
There's something new in the bowl.
Look, we have enough. Just walk away.
No, but l want the pine cones.
There's a forest right outside.
lt's not the same.
Okay, go quick.
Thank you for a delightful stay.
My maple candy!
Food here at 'Javu'.. will kill you..
the food here at 'Javu' ... will kill you..
lt's just you. l thought someone
was swinging a bag of cats against the wall.
You'd better get back in that kitchen.
The garlic's not gonna overuse itself.
Okay, you have to stop playing now.
Why?
The only person my playing is bothering is you.
Oh, yeah? Let's settle this. Come on.
Get your garlic peelers off me.
Excuse me? Excuse me?
Hi, l'm Monica Geller. l'm the head chef here.
Okay, l was actually expecting a little applause there,
but whatever.
Quick question. By a show of hands...
...how many of you were bothered
by this woman's singing outside?
Okay, okay.
How many of you enjoyed the music outside?
Let me ask you this question.
How many thought the music was fine...
...but not in keeping with the tone of the restaurant?
Okay, well, who identified this restaurant's tone as
''pretentious-comma-garlicky''?
Okay, who thinks the food is delicious
and a little pretension never hurt anyone?
Okay, well, all right,
who thinks the food is fine, the music was fine...
...but your evening was ruined
by this incessant poll-taking?
Excuse us.
All right, here's a question.
Who was so worried about her restaurant being fancy...
...that she made a big deal
about her friend playing her music...
...and feels really bad about it now?
Well, who was so stupid and stubborn...
...that she lashed out against her friend's cooking...
...which she actually thinks is pretty great?
l'm sorry.
l'm sorry too.
Hey, you wanna stick around
and l'll whip you up some dinner?
Yeah, as long as it's free.
The food here is ridiculously overpr--
Who hopes the hand-raising thing
is still cute enough that you won't hate me?
Hey.
Hey.
Joey, do you have peanut butter on the back of your head?
Oh, man. l thought l got it all.
How...?
How?
l was making a peanut butter smoothie, right?
l couldn't find this little plastic thingy
that goes in the top of the blender.
And l thought,
''Well, you know, how important can that be?'' Right?
Turns out, very.
Wow, definitely just Drake.
What?
How's it going with Drake?
l don't think it's going very well.
What?
That scene l saw was so good.
Well, l'm feeling really insecure
about the one we're shooting tomorrow.
ls this that thing you do
when you say you're bad so l'll give you a compliment?
A little.
No, l really am worried.
l have to make it convincing
that l'm in love with Olivia.
So?
So l've never played that.
Oh, honey,
it can't be that hard.
l mean, you've been in love before.
Well, just once...
...with you.
Okay. Well, this could be a little awkward.
l'm just gonna blow past it.
Well, look, can't you just use that method-actor thing...
...where you use your real-life memories
to help you in your performance?
What the hell are you talking about?
All right, look, just try to remember
how you felt when you were in love...
...and think about that when you're playing the scene.
Okay. Yeah, l think l can do that.
Yeah. Okay, there's this party scene coming up.
And Olivia and her husband are there...
...and all Drake wants to do is grab her
and kiss her, but he can't.
That makes me think about those times
l wanted to grab you and kiss you...
...but you didn't know,
so l would just pretend everything was cool...
...but really it was killing me.
Joey, you never talked about that before.
Hey, you know what else l could use?
There's this scene
where Drake sneaks into Olivia's bedroom...
...and she doesn't know he's there,
which never happened with us.
l mean, he knows he shouldn't be there,
but he just wants to look at her.
You know?
And l remember all those mornings
before you even put on your makeup...
...when l would think to myself, ''My God, she is beautiful.''
And it hurt so much because l knew
l could never tell you.
But it was worth it
just to be there looking at you.
Thanks, dude. This is great!
l got you something from Vermont.
Besides tampons and salt?
Oh, my God.
Maple candy. That's so sweet of you.
That's weird, it's empty.
Hi, you guys. What's going on?
You guys wanna hang out or...?
Do you guys hear a buzzing?
Hey, you guys?
What are you doing tomorrow night?
Oh, well, let me see. l believe l'm....
Yes, falling asleep in front of the TV.
Well, my agent hooked me up
with six tickets to a great play.
l could fall asleep at a play.
What is it?
lt's a one-woman play called:
Why Don't You Like Me?
A Bitter Woman's Journey Through Life.
That sounds interesting.
That does sound interesting.
To listen to a woman complain for two hours.
l don't think it gets bet--
l know! l know. We can drive.
We can vote. We can work.
What more do these broads want?
Well, you guys will have a great time.
l promise.
What? How come you don't have to go?
l wish l could, but l found out...
...that l have to be at work really early the next day,
so l can't go.
But take the extra ticket
and invite whoever you want.
Let's see. Who do l hate?
Oh, sorry.
Oops, sorry.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay. Up we go.
Oh, gosh, okay!
Can l ask you a question?
Do you think it's possible
for two friends to fool around...
...and not have it be a big deal?
No, l don't think that ever works. Why?
No reason.
No, no. Rachel?
Who do you want to fool around with?
Nobody! Forget it.
Joey?
Maybe.
You can't.
Why?
Because!
Okay, seriously,
did not understand a word you just said.
ln the hall.
Okay.
You wanna fool around with Joey?
Yeah.
Ever since l had that dream about him,
l can't get it out of my head.
l mean, what's the big deal?
People do it all the time.
Who? Who do you know that are friends that just fool around?
Okay. Off the top of my head....
Don and Janet.
Who are they?
l know them from work.
Both of them?
No, just one of them.
Which one?
l don't know.
What were the names l just said?
No, Rachel,
things could get incredibly complicated.
All right. You're right.
l won't do anything with Joey.
l just thought it--
Okay, so that's two cups of tarragon,
one pound of baking soda and a red onion?
What the hell are you cooking?
Friends S09E20 The One With The Soap Opera Party
You guys won't believe
what l have to do for work today.
Yes, but, Ross,
you chose a career
of talking about dinosaurs.
There are these two professors
who are joining my department...
...and l have to meet them here
and show them around campus.
What's so bad about that?
l just know they'll be
a couple of old windbags...
...wearing tweed jackets
with suede elbow patches.
Ross?
What? These aren't suede.
Excuse me.
l'm looking for someone.
You don't, by any chance,
know a Ross Geller?
No.
Hi. Hi, l'm Ross Geller.
Oh, hi. l'm Professor Wheeler.
Oh, that's-- That's-- That's nice.
lt's good to meet you.
Thank you so much for
taking the time to show me around.
No, it's no big deal.
lf l weren't doing this,
l'd just, you know,
be at the gym working out.
ls he gonna introduce us?
l think we're just blurry shapes to him now.
By the way, l really enjoyed your paper...
...on the connection between geographic isolation and rapid mutagenesis.
l wrote that in one night.
Twenty bucks says
they're married within the month.
Well, we should probably get going.
You know, we've got a lot of ground to cover.
lsn't another professor
supposed to come with us?
l don't think so.
l'm pretty sure.
A Professor Spafford from Cornell?
Well, he's obviously late,
and the rule in my class is:
lf you can't come on time,
then don't come at all.
An option that many of my students use.
Shall we?
We shouldn't wait for him?
You know what, he's a big boy.
l'm sure he'll find us, okay?
Professor Geller?
Oh, damn it!
Hi, Joey, it's Jan Rogers.
Can't wait for your party tonight.
Listen, l forgot your address.
Can you give me a call? Thanks. Bye.
What's happenin'?
lt's a real shame you can't make it
to that one-woman show tonight.
l'd love to,
but l gotta get up so early the next day.
You know me, work comes first.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Hi, Joey, it's Jan Rogers.
Can't wait for your party tonight.
Stupid Jan Rogers!
You are having a party tonight?
l'm kind of having a thing for
the Days of Our Lives people.
And you weren't gonna tell us?
How did you think you were gonna get away with that?
l do it every year.
You do that every year?!
l didn't have to tell you that!
God, l'm stupider than Jan Rogers!
Why wouldn't you invite us to your parties?
You're fine, okay?
But everyone else acts
like an idiot around famous people.
Well, then, so just invite me.
Please, l was trying to be nice.
You're the worst one.
Joey, come on! Please, please?
Let me come. l will behave. l promise.
l will behave. Please, please, please.
Okay, fine. You can come.
But don't tell anybody else.
lt's up on the roof at 8.
A soap-opera roof party?!
l'm going to a soap-opera roof party!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
And it's out of my system.
And then my wife and l went on a cruise to the Galbagos.
There was a seafood buffet
you wouldn't believe.
There were clams and mussels and oysters...
...and cracked crab...
...and snow crab...
...and king crab.
lt's a pity l'm allergic to shellfish.
So where did you get your undergraduate degree?
And that's not all l'm allergic to.
Oh, it's not over.
l'm also allergic to peanuts and cashews...
...and almonds and filberts--
So basically all nuts!
lnterestingly, no.
Kinda playing fast and loose with
the word "interesting"
lf you'll excuse me,
l'm going to use the restroom.
Oh, my God!
l've lost the will to live.
Let's ditch him.
What?
While he's still in the bathroom.
l am begging you.
Okay. Okay, fine,
but l just have one question for you.
When we exit,
should we walk or run...
...or prance or stroll--?
Stop it! Stop it!
He talks slow, but he might pee fast.
Okay, let's move!
Oh, hey, you guys, this is Charlie.
Charlie, this is Phoebe
and my sister, Monica.
Hi.
Charlie will be joining my department.
You're a paleontologist too?
Yeah.
Oh, okay. Now, what do you think...
...of Renyard's new theory of
species variegation in segmented arthropods?
Well, l think he's a little out there,
but he does have some interesting ideas.
Oh, l'm sorry. l have to take this.
Excuse me.
Renyard's theory of species variegation?
l saw the article on your coffee table.
l memorized the title to freak you out.
So did you two have fun?
Oh, my God. She's great.
We have so much in common,
and she's just cool, you know? And funny.
And l don't know if you've noticed,
but she's a hottie!
Hi!
Hi, you guys. Listen, you know what,
l'm not feeling really well...
...and l don't think l'm gonna get to go to the play.
Really? What's wrong?
l don't know. l think it's kind of serious.
You know, l was watching this thing on TV this morning...
...about Newcastle disease,
and l think l might have it.
Newcastle disease is
a secretion-borne virus...
...that only affects chickens and other poultry.
Okay, who's this?
l'm sorry. Rachel,
this is Charlie Wheeler. She's a colleague.
Hi. Well, l would shake your hand...
...but l'm sure you don't want to
get my chicken disease.
Rachel, can l see you for a second?
Sure.
You're not sick.
What? Yes, l am!
Okay, then why are you all dressed up?
When you're sick, you do whatever you can
to make yourself feel better.
You just want to stay home
so you can make a move on Joey.
No, l heard you before.
That is so not what this is.
Okay, then what is this?
Okay.
Joey is having a secret
Days of Our Lives party up on the roof.
And he sent you guys to
the play to get rid of you.
What?!
What? What's going on?
Joey is having a secret
Days of Our Lives party up on the roof!
He didn't want you to know about it,
but l came over here to tell you.
You came to say you were sick.
All right, professor or detective?
Wait, Joey's having a party,
and he wasn't gonna invite us?
He does it every year.
That's why he's sending you to the play.
That's why he sent us to that medieval restaurant
and to that button factory.
And that horrible museum tour?
No, l arranged that.
Hey, you guys, l'm turning in.
Have fun.
We know about your party, Joey.
What party?
The game's over. Take off your robe.
Okay, l mean....
Close it up! Close it up!
Nice to meet you.
Hey, you made it! All right!
Glad you could make it. Thanks for coming.
Oh, my God. Kyle Lowder!
Hi.
l love you!
Hey. That's why l didn't invite you.
You have to calm down, all right?
Just go get yourself a drink or something.
Oh, yeah, that's what you want.
My inhibitions lowered.
Oh, my God, can you believe
we're surrounded by all this?
l can barely control myself.
Monica,
you might want to remember that you're married.
Where is Chandler anyway?
Oh, my God! Chandler!
Where the hell is everybody?
Why Don't You Like Me?
Chapter 1 : My First Period.
Hey, Joey said no autographs.
But if she's getting one, l want one too!
''To Monica.''
And none of this ''best wishes'' crap.
l want ''love.''
Okay, actually, Mon,
Matthew was giving me his phone number.
Oh, man! lf l had known
l was coming to this party...
...l never would've gotten married!
lt was nice to meet you. Rachel.
Nice to meet you.
Call me.
We will!
Look at you with all the guys!
l guess you've forgotten all about Joey.
Yeah, well, l guess l have forgotten about Joey.
And clearly,
you've forgotten about Chandler.
Please. Chandler's the love of my life.
Oh, leather pants! Have mercy!
So it's probably gonna be hard for you
to leave Boston, huh?
Actually, l'm kind of happy to be leaving.
l just broke up with someone.
Oh, so sad.
Still, it can't be easy
for you to leave Harvard.
Especially after working with
a Nobel Prize winner like Albert Wintermeyer.
Actually, Albie is the guy l broke up with.
You dated Albert Wintermeyer?
Yeah.
And you called him "Albie"?
l mean, that's like calling Albert Einstein....
Albie.
Yeah, well, he is a brilliant man.
You think? l mean, you went out with the guy...
...who improved the accuracy of radiocarbon dating
by a factor of 10!
Yes, and while that is everything
one looks for in a boyfriend...
...he had a lot of issues.
Oh, like what?
l'm sorry. l don't mean to pry.
lt's just that this must be...
...what regular people experience when they watch Access Hollywood.
Okay, you want the dirt?
Albie was seriously insecure.
He was really intimidated
by the guy l dated before him.
Who's intimidating to a guy
who won the Nobel Prize?
A guy who won two.
Two? What--?
Don't tell me you dated Benjamin Hobart?
Yeah, for three years.
Oh, my God.
Have you ever been in a relationship
with someone who hasn't won the Nobel Prize?
No.
But there was my first boyfriend, Billy.
Oh, yeah? No Nobel Prizes for him?
No, but he did just win
the MacArthur ''genius grant.''
What a loser.
Some more wine?
Hey, Ross. How's it going with Charlie?
Oh, great. After l finish my wine...
...l'm gonna blow my average-sized brains out.
What's the matter?
She only dates geniuses
and Nobel Prize winners.
Oh, my God,
at the Chinese restaurant earlier today...
...l put chopsticks in my mouth
and pretended to be a woolly mammoth.
l always loved that.
Of course you would!
Your brains are smaller than mine!
l can't compete with the guys she goes out with.
They're so out of my league.
Oh, my God!
Worse?
Oh, much, much worse.
l did my impression of Joan Rivers as one of the earliest amphibians.
''Can we walk?''
Oh, you like that?
No.
What?
Come on! l think that's funny!
Woolly mammoth.
lt's good!
l bet you're thinking that now would be a great time
for an intermission, huh?
Oh, yes. God, yes.
Well, you're not gonna get one!
Because in life,
there are no intermissions, people!
Now, Chapter 7:
Divorce is a Four-Letter Word!
How could he leave me?!
l don't know. You seem lovely.
Ross, this is one of my costars, Dirk.
Dirk, this is my good friend Ross.
Nice to meet you.
So, what show are you on?
l'm not an actor.
l'm a professor of paleontology.
That's science.
Hey, well, listen,
l play a scientist on Days.
Yeah, my character just won a Nobel Prize.
Ross, Dirk was wondering about the woman
you brought and if you guys are together?
Well, no, but....
l mean, she only goes out with really, really smart guys.
Hey, l got a 690 on my SATs.
l'd lead with that.
That's it. Just sign right on the bra.
Monica!
Don't worry, Joe. l won't come next year!
What the--?
What do you got there?
Just some boys gave me their phone numbers.
Oh, really? Let me see.
Damn, that's a lot of guys.
Are you a little slutty?
l think l am.
Let me see if l approve of any of these clowns.
This guy wears a rug.
Well....
This guy's Canadian.
Oh, and this guy is in a cult, okay?
lt'll cost you $5000 to get to level three,
and l don't feel any different.
Pass. Pa-- Oh, pass. Pass.
Why? What's wrong with these guys?
Well, nothing major.
lt's just that, you know, they're not really good enough for you...
...and you deserve the best.
Joey, you're so sweet.
lt's true, but it doesn't matter.
l already know who you're going home with.
Who?
Me.
What?
Really?
Yeah, because we live together.
lt's a joke! lt's a joke.
Right! That's funny! l get it!
Got you!
You're funny, Joey.
Oh, my God.
So how did you enjoy the play?
Oh, my God. Honey, l am so, so, so, so sorry.
Well, you should be.
You missed the most powerful three hours
in the history of the theater.
You really liked it?
Oh, yeah. l mean, at first l hated it.
But why wouldn't l?
Because as a man,
l've been trained not to listen!
But after Chapter 16:
Fat, Single and Ready to Mingle...
...l was uplifted.
Oh, really?
Oh, yeah.
l had no idea the amazing journey
you go through as a woman.
Tell me--
Tell me about your first period.
No!
Did somebody sign your bra?
So l got it when l was 13. Very difficult.
Hey, Ross? So listen,
about you and the dinosaur girl?
Are you really just gonna
let a couple of Nobel Prizes scare you off?
What is that? Come on, a piece of paper?
lt's actually a million-dollar prize.
Go, Charlie!
But my point is...
...okay, so she dated them,
but she also broke up with them.
Maybe she's looking to, you know,
slum it with some average Joe Ph.D.
Yeah, maybe,
and l do have my whole career in front of me.
l mean....
l could still win a Nobel Prize.
Although the last two papers l've written
were widely discredited.
You're so much more than just brains.
You are sweet and kind and funny.
And sexy.
Okay, well, give her a chance to see all that.
Yeah. Yeah. You're right.
Thanks. l'm gonna go find her.
Good for you.
And your paper on punctuated equilibrium
in the Devonian Era was topnotch.
Stop going through my stuff!
l just wanted to let you know
l've changed my mind.
l'm gonna do it.
l'm gonna kiss Joey.
No! You can't!
Friends hooking up is a bad idea.
Please! What about you and Chandler?
That's different. l was drunk and stupid.
Well, hello?
What about all the guys that you got the phone numbers from?
Why don't you just kiss one of them.
l could...
...but l don't want to. l want to kiss Joey.
All right. l think it's a big mistake,
but it's your decision.
l'm gonna do it.
And l can't stop you?
No.
Well, can l at least have the phone numbers.
Hey, Rach,
have you seen Charlie anywhere?
l'm smarter than him!
Hey, thank you so much for these tickets, Chandler.
This was a really important experience for me
and l wanted to share it with you.
You're so wonderful.
Why Don't You Like Me?
Chapter 1 : My First Period.
l can't believe you guys bought that.
Enjoy your slow death.
lt's so weird.
How did Joey end up kissing Charlie last night?
l thought you'd end up kissing Charlie.
l thought l'd end up kissing Charlie too.
But surprise!
l missed most of the party.
Charlie's a girl, right?
Yeah,
she's this new professor in my department
that l did not kiss.
l don't know why Joey had to kiss her.
Of all the girls at the party, God!
Why do you care so much?
Yes, Rachel. Why do you care so much?
Because Ross is the father of my child.
You know, and l want him to
hook up with lots of women.
All l'm saying is,
l don't think that Joey and Charlie
have anything in common.
l don't know.
They seemed to have a shared interest
in each other's tonsils.
Wow. Joey and a professor.
Can you imagine if they had kids?
And if the kids got her intelligence...
...and Joey's raw sexual magnetism...
...those nerds would get laid!
All right. So, Ross, you're okay with all this?
l mean....
lt's no big deal.
l just met her.
l'm fine with it.
God, l forgot how hot she was.
l'm gonna get some more coffee.
Oh, you know, l'll come with you.
Okay.
So a professor, huh?
Yeah. She is cool. And she's so smart.
Her mind is totally acrimonious.
Guess that's not how she used it.
l feel like l owe you an explanation.
l don't ordinarily go around kissing guys at parties.
l'm....
Well, l'm kind of embarrassed.
l really hope you don't think less of me.
Think less of you?
No. l don't think less of you.
l mean, you saw someone you liked
and you kissed them.
Those people who like someone
and don't kiss them...
...those people are stupid.
l hate those people.
Actually, l'm a little surprised at myself.
l mean, Joey's so different from
the guys l usually date.
They're all professors, intellectuals.
Paleontologists mostly.
You know, very cerebral--
Yeah, l know the type.
lf we want to grab a bite before work,
we'd better get acrimonious.
No? Am l getting close?
Friends S09E21 The One At The Fertility Clinic
-Hey! -Hi.
Hey, you guys. Look what l just got.
Oh, wow! l love those!
Where did you get them?
l bought them off eBay.
They used to belong to the late Shania Twain.
Phoebe, Shania Twain is still alive.
Oh, then l overpaid.
Hey, what's this?
Oh, it's a gift certificate
to this new spa in SoHo.
You can't show Phoebe this.
She hates those corporate massage chains.
What, now l can't get a massage?
There are so many things that she disapproves of.
l can't eat veal.
l can't wear fur.
l can't go hunting.
Do you want to go hunting?
l would like to have the option.
What's that? Hey, Rachel?
No, you can't go there!
You know how l feel about these big massage places.
They're putting people like me out of business.
She wants to go hunting too!
Phoebe, come on, l don't want to waste it.
lt would be like throwing away 100 bucks.
Okay, this is not about the money. Okay?
lt's about corporate greed destroying our hearts...
...and leaving us hollow shells.
l don't care about any of that.
Well, do you care about friendship?
l feel really strongly about this.
Please don't use this gift certificate.
l'm asking you as a friend.
Oh, not as a friend. Phoebe!
Fine. l won't use it.
Promise?
l promise.
Thank you.
Well, l am going hunting.
Hey, honey. l missed you today.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah. Hey.
What do you wanna do tonight?
Oh, well, maybe we could....
Okay, trying to turn me on
by making a mess?
Know your audience.
Besides,
tomorrow we're doing those fertility tests.
Until then, you need to
keep your tadpoles in the tank.
Do we really need to take those tests?
We've been trying to have a baby for a year.
l think it's a good idea
to find out if everything's okay.
Just a few routine tests.
But l don't want to do it in a cup.
What is the big deal?
lt's weird! You're in a doctor's office.
lt's not okay to do it in a doctor's office...
...but it is okay to do it in a parked car
behind a Taco Bell?
l cannot believe Ross told you that.
And in my defense,
it was a Wendy's.
Look, l don't want to do these tests either.
But l really do think it's a good idea.
l'm sure a doctor's office can't be worse...
...than on a class trip
to the Hershey factory.
Oh, yeah! Rachel talks too!
Who says wine has to cost more than milk?
Hey!
Hi.
Come on in. How are you?
l'm good.
Can l offer you a drink?
Please.
l have been crazed all day.
l had a meeting with the dean,
my syllabus for summer school's due...
...and l'm writing the foreword for a friend's book.
l had a pretty hectic day at work too.
Today l had to open a door and go:
So l am just so excited to be here.
l can't wait to explore the city.
lf you need a tour guide....
Oh, you mean it?
That would be so fun.
Oh, yeah, definitely. Definitely. Okay.
What do you want to see first?
We could go see the Kronos Quartet
at Avery Fisher Hall.
Okay.
There's a collection of Walt Whitman letters
on display at the public library.
l know.
But first, l have to see the Met.
Okay, let me stop you right there.
The Mets suck, okay?
You wanna see the Yankees.
No. No, not the Mets.
The Met. Singular.
Which one? They all suck.
The museum.
l don't think so.
Hi there.
Hello. Welcome to Lavender Day Spa.
How may l help you?
Hi. l have a massage appointment
under Rachel Green.
Okay.
And here is my gift certificate.
This has been torn up.
And taped back together.
Okay. Well, l'll call you as soon as
your massage therapist is ready.
Okay.
Have a seat through the glass doors.
Through the glass doors.
Through the glass doors.
All righty then.
Phoebe, your next client's
in the waiting room.
Do we have to talk like that
when they're not around?
Oh, no. No, no.
Listen,
is there someone who can fill in for me?
Sorry. Everyone is booked.
That woman can't know l work here.
She's a friend of mine
and l made this big stink...
...about how awful these massage chains are.
Then why do you work here?
Because it's good money.
But that doesn't change the fact...
...that this is an evil, bloodsucking corporate machine.
Well, l think this is a great place to work.
Okay, are they listening?
Ross. Hey.
Hi.
l need to talk to you about Charlie.
Oh, do you? Do you really?
Yeah, l'm kind of having a little problem.
Look, if you don't know
what the word ''acrimonious'' means,
just don't use it.
Look, you know Charlie, right?
She's cool, funny, her body is so--
Get to the problem.
Right. She's just so much smarter
than all the girls l've ever dated.
Combined.
You know? And l just-- l don't want her to
think l'm stupid.
Are you wearing two belts?
Hey, what do you know?
You were saying
you didn't want to seem stupid.
Well, she wants to go to
all these cultural places...
...and l don't know how to talk about that stuff.
You gotta help me out.
l really don't want to get involved in your guys' relationship.
Oh, dude, please.
Come on, you're the smartest person l know.
And l really like this girl, okay?
l don't want to lose her.
Fine.
Thanks.
Okay. Let's see.
Oh, you should take her to the Met.
The Mets.
No, no, no. The Met.
The Metropolitan Museum of Art.
Oh, that's what she meant.
lf they're gonna shorten it,
they should call it the ''Muse,'' you know?
Short for ''museum'' and avoid all the confusion.
Yeah, most days the place is packed with confused,
angry baseball fans.
Okay. All right, so l'll take her to the Met.
Yeah. Okay. There's this great rare bookstore
on Madison Avenue.
You know what? She loves architecture.
You should take a walk down Fifth
to the St. Patrick's Cathedral.
And there, there's this great little pastry shop
that she'd love.
Jeez. Sounds like you should be
going on this date.
But l'm not.
And you know what--?
Okay, slow down.
You're going way too fast. Okay?
Just go back to the Met.
So you gotta tell me exactly what to do there.
When you walk into the museum,
take a right, okay?
That's the antiquities wing.
Ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia,
up to the Byzantine Empire.
Okay. So l walk in the door and make a right.
l have a weird feeling about this place.
How do l know...
...they won't secretly videotape me
and put it all over the lnternet?
Because, honey,
and l mean this in the sweetest way possible...
...nobody's gonna wanna watch that.
Mr. Bing? Here you are.
Go into that room
and deposit your specimen into the container.
Deposit my specimen?
l usually have to call a 900 number
for that kind of talk.
Thanks. Got it.
All right. Honey,
my tests are down the hall.
Are you sure you're gonna be okay?
Yeah, l guess.
Look, l know this is embarrassing,
but nobody cares.
No one here even knows you.
Oh, my God!
Oh, come on!
How great is this?
We're probably fertile.
Let's go home.
Why are you here?
Sid and l are trying again
and we had trouble last time
because apparently we...
No, no, no. l mean, why?
Why is she here?
Oh, someone's a little cranky today
because they have to do it in a cup.
Oh, they gave you the kiddie size.
What?
This was fun.
But l've got an invasive vaginal exam to get to.
l'd love to stay
but l've got a hot date.
Please go.
Just let me know if you need a hand.
l think it just fell off.
Hello, ja.
lt's time for your massage, ja?
Put your face in the hole.
A Swedish massage from a real Swedish person.
Okay, then l'm Swedish.
So, what's your name?
lt's a normal Swedish name.
lkea.
Wow. What an interesting name.
Yeah.
You know, l--
Time for your scalp massage.
Wow. l really love your--
ls something wrong?
No, it's just....
lt just feels so good...
...lkea.
Hey, say, you'll know this.
What's the capital of Sweden?
Stockholm.
Damn. l wish l knew if that was right.
Note the painterly lines
and subtle impasto on this canvas.
Monet painted quickly,
and usually outdoors...
...as his elusive subject was light itself.
Now, do you have any idea what you just said?
No, no. My mouth says the words,
my brain is thinking "monster trucks."
Now, remember,
when you get to the museum...
...Monet is not spelled M-O-N-A-Y. l just--
l wrote that out phonetically for you.
Phonetically?
Yeah, that means--
We just don't have time for this.
l gotta say, l'm really impressed
you were able to memorize
all this so quickly.
l'm an actor. l can memorize anything.
Last week on Days, l had to say:
''Frontal temporal zygomatic craniotomy.''
Wow. What does that mean?
No idea.
But the guy l said it to
dies in the next scene...
...so l guess it means,
''You'll get eaten by a bear.''
Okay.
So let's move on to the Renaissance.
Okay.
Caravaggio uses chiaroscuro here...
...to highlight the anguish of the central figure.
Touch it. lt's really bumpy.
No, no, no. No ad-libbing.
And, dude, you can't touch the paintings.
Come on.
No. No!
My specimen's in the room.
l just want to thank whoever knocked on the door
while l was in there.
Really helped speed the process along.
Janice, you're not gone?
Sid is still in his room.
l don't allow porn at home,
so this is like a vacation for him.
So did you do it?
Did you make your deposit?
Yeah. The hard part's over.
That's not the hard part, honey.
The hard part's what comes next.
Aren't you worried about the results?
l haven't even thought about the results.
l just assumed everything would be okay.
Well, you know what?
lt probably is.
But what if it's not okay?
l mean, what if there's a reason we can't have a baby?
Chandler. Look,
you and Monica are meant to have children.
l'm sure it's gonna be just fine.
Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Thanks.
l can't believe l didn't even think of that.
l guess l was so worried about
having to come here and do that.
You can do it in a Taco Bell parking lot...
...but you can't do it at a doctor's office?
lt was a Wendy's!
And that's the Swedish national anthem.
Thank you for asking.
Wow, lkea.
What a rich culture.
You know what?
l have a friend who's a masseuse.
Oh? Ja, ja?
Ja. She's not very good, though.
And why do you think that is?
l don't know.
Maybe it's because she's got such callousy fingers...
...from playing crummy guitar.
Or maybe she has trouble loosening your knots...
...because you're such a high-maintenance tight-ass.
Phoebe!
You know it's me?
Well, for like a half an hour!
Man, you can lie about Sweden!
How can you come here?
Why didn't you tell me you work here?
l don't have to tell you everything!
You do if you're gonna make me
feel guilty for getting a free massage.
Tip's not included.
Why did you lie to me about working here?
Because l was ashamed, okay?
l sold out for the cash.
And they give me benefits,
like medical and dental and a four-oh-wunk.
But, you know, you pay a price.
Now l'm this corporate stooge...
...and punching a clock...
...and paying taxes!
Phoebe, honey, if you hate it so much...
...you should walk out there right now and quit.
Be true to what you believe in.
Honey, you have principles,
and l so admire that.
l don't have any.
You know what? You're right.
l am gonna quit.
lt's time l took my life back.
Good for you, Pheebs.
lf you guys have microphones in there too,
l didn't mean any of that.
l love you.
Got you! Die! Die! Die!
Respectfully, Professor R. Geller.
Hey.
Hi.
Hey, how was the Met?
The museum was amazing.
Yeah, Joey really knows his art, huh?
Not so much, no.
He had clearly memorized all this stuff to say...
...and some of it didn't even make any sense.
What do you mean?
Well, for one...
...he was talking about paintings
that were nowhere around.
Wait a minute.
When you guys walked into the Met,
did you go to the right?
No. No, we went to the left.
Oh, Joey, Joey, Joey.
Still, it seems like you guys are
having a great time together.
Yeah. Yeah, it's fun.
What?
Actually, Joey's your friend...
...and you don't know me that well.
lt'd be weird.
Well, l mean, a little.
But no, what? Go on.
Well....
l'm thinking that maybe Joey isn't
the right guy for me right now.
You know,
maybe l should be with someone...
...l have more in common with.
You know what l mean?
Yeah.
Yeah, but you know what?
l think you should give Joey a chance.
l mean, he's a great guy.
And sure, he doesn't know that much about art...
...but you can always talk about that with someone else.
l guess that's true.
lf you think about it...
...he memorized all that stuff
because he thought it was important to you.
You know, that's the kind of guy Joey is.
He is very sweet.
Plus, he is hot!
That was gonna be my next argument.
You ready?
Yeah. Let's go.
Wow!
Thanks, Ross.
Yeah.
Hey, Ross. That art stuff worked.
You hooked me up.
Glad l could help, man.
Some of the stuff wasn't where you said it would be,
but l made it work.
lt is not okay that l'm aroused by this now.
Hello?
Oh. Hi, Dr.Connelly.
No. Well, she's not here...
...but l can tell her.
Should l be sitting down for this?
Well, so, what does that mean?
Okay. Okay, thank you.
Thanks.
Hey, sweetie.
Dr.Connelly just called.
With good news?
Of course it's not good news.
You said, ''Dr. Connelly just called.''
lf it was good, you'd have said,
''Dr. Connelly just called!''
So, what is it? ls it...?
ls there a problem?
ls there a problem with me, or with you?
Actually, it's both of us.
What?
Apparently, my sperm have low motility...
...and you have an inhospitable environment.
Well, what does that mean?
lt means that my guys won't get off their Barcaloungers...
...and you have a uterus
that is prepared to kill the ones that do.
lt means--
Wait, Chandler.
lt means that we can keep trying...
...but there's a good chance this may never happen for us.
Oh, my God.
l'm sorry.
l'm sorry too.
Well...
...we're gonna figure this out.
l know.
Good morning, Phoebe.
Good morning, receptionist.
Here's your schedule for the day.
Your first client is in Room 1 .
''Rachel Greene.''
Son of a bitch! She came back?
Are you ready for your Scottish massage?
Put your face in the hole, lassie!
Oh, that feels so good.
Oh, lucky me.
Coffee and a live sex show.
l'm sorry, what?
l'm sorry.
Nothing. l was just reading to Emma.
From Cosmo?
Yeah. Yeah, it's:
''Climax Your Way to Better Skin.''
So l have to go shopping today,
which is my least favorite thing.
l'm so bad at picking out clothes.
So you need someone who knows fashion
to tell you what looks good.
Not me...
Oh, hey, Rach?
Yeah?
Maybe you could take Charlie shopping?
Oh, well....
l'm sure you have better things to do.
You kidding?
Rachel loves to shop,
and she has great taste.
She's the one that taught me,
you don't wear white after Labor Day...
...and to always, always, always
put on underwear when trying on clothes.
lf you have the time,
l'd really appreciate the help.
Okay. Yeah, let's shop.
Okay, you are gonna come back
with some very classy clothes.
And some slutty lingerie. Slutty!
Okay, great. All right, bye.
Pain in the ass!
That's off, right?
What's the matter, Pheebs?
Mike's sister just invited me
to a party tonight
and he's gonna be there.
She was like, ''Don't worry.
l asked him
and he's totally okay with seeing you.''
So now l have to go so he'll think
that l'm totally okay with seeing him.
Which you're not.
Because you're hung up on him.
Exactly.
You want him to eat his heart out,
so you have to look fabulous.
l didn't even think about that.
Sexual politics!
Pheebs, l'm taking Charlie shopping.
Come and l'll help you find something.
That'd be great.
Oh, isn't that nice? The three of you,
trying on slutty lingerie together.
That's not what we're gonna do.
Why'd you ruin it?
Who was l hurting?
Friends S09E22 The One With The Donor
Fortunately, she has a very pretty face.
l still can't believe this.
My uterus is an inhospitable environment?
l've always tried so hard
to be a good hostess.
l can't believe my sperm have low motility.
Because let me tell you, while l was growing up,
they sure seemed to be in a hurry to get places.
Hi there.
Hi.
l'm sorry there wasn't better news
from your tests last week...
...but l wanted to talk to you
about your options.
Okay.
Well,first of all.
Even though your chances of conceiving
through natural means aren't great...
...you never know,
so keep having sex on a regular basis.
Oh, damn it!
Don't worry.
After a while, you'll tune it out.
Given your situation,
the options with the greatest chances for success...
...would be surrogacy or insemination using a sperm donor.
Ok.
lf you feel that neither of those
is right for you,
you could always adopt.
ls that a hint?
Because we love you, Dr.Connelly,
but we don't want you to be our child.
Wow!
Talk about an inhospitable environment.
Hi. Okay, you ready to go pick up Phoebe
and go shopping?
Let's do it.
All right, have a good time.
Not gonna find any clothes in there.
Hey, you guys.
Hi.
Guess who's up for keynote speaker
at the National Paleontology Conference?
Chris Bailey?
Yeah, right.
When was the last time
he made a submission deadline for an abstract?
Why are you laughing?
Just seeing what it'd be like
to be a paleontologist.
lt's fun. Yeah.
So you're up for keynote speaker?
Who's deciding?
Professor Sherman.
l'm meeting with him today.
He's a pretty tough guy to impress.
l think l know how to dazzle him.
You're not gonna to do a magic trick,
are you?
No.
Hey, guys.
Wait a minute, you guys.
l want to ask you something.
l may get to speak at this paleontology convention.
lf l do, l'd love for you guys
to come and hear me.
l think l can safely say that
we all have family issues, work and/or are sick.
lt's in Barbados.
But you come first.
l'm there.
See you later.
Okay, bye.
Bye. See you.
Bye.
So how did it go at the fertility clinic?
Not as much fun as last time.
Apparently, you only get porn
if you're giving a sperm sample.
So, what did the doctor say?
There's surrogacy, but Monica's dreamt
her whole life of carrying a child...
...and she just felt that watching
a surrogate would be too hard for her.
So you're ruling out surrogacy?
Yeah.
So l don't have to learn what that means?
Aside from adoption,
the only other choice is insemination...
...so we're talking about sperm donors.
Enough said. l'm there for you, man.
Where is she, upstairs?
So how do you feel about all this?
l wish there was an easier way
for us to have a child,
but there isn't one.
Come on, Ross, be a good guy.
Step up and do it.
What?
What?! No! l'm not gonna give them Ben!
The data we're receiving
from MRl scans and DNA testing...
...of these fossils are staggering.
l mean, we've been accepting
Leakey's dates as a given.
But if they're off
by even a 100,000 years or so...
...then you can just throw most of our assumptions...
...you know, right in the trash.
So, what l'm saying is....
ls that....
ls that repercussions could be huge.
l mean, not just in paleontology,
but if you think about it...
...in evolutionary biology, genetics, geology.
l mean, truly, the mind boggles.
Well, that's not what you want.
lncentive for Men?
l'll take some of that.
Pheebs, that's for men.
l know.
When l go to the party later...
...Mike will know l'm over him
because l'll smell like another guy.
Okay.
Oh, good, l'm dating a Russian cabdriver.
Seriously, does anyone buy this?
l smell like beets.
So, you know what,
l really like those jackets
with the shoulder pads in them.
Where do you think those would be?
On Melanie Griffith in Working Girl.
l think what you want is over here.
See, l told you l needed someone.
By the way, as a thank you,
l would really love to take you out.
Really?
Yeah!
Actually Joey and I
are going to the movies tonight,
wanna come?
Oh, l can't.
Because l've seen them.
You've seen all the movies?
Yeah. l'm a big fan.
Of the movies.
You know, motion pictures.
The talkies.
Rach,
will you come with me to a dressing room?
Sure.
Okay.
Maybe we could do something else.
You know, that depends on what it is.
l've done a lot of stuff.
So, what were you doing out there?
Do you not like Charlie?
She's okay.
l don't know,
l just don't get a really good vibe from her.
Why?
l don't know.
You know, just the way
she waltzed in here all smart...
...and tall, you know...
...and just swept Joey off his feet.
Nobody else has a chance.
Who else?
Anybody.
You. Me.
You know, Monica's mom.
You like Joey?!
Phoebe!
All right, look, l do.
l have a little thing for him. Just--
Oh, my God.
lt's just physical.
l have it totally under control, okay?
lt's just when l see them together...
...sometimes, l just get a little jealous.
Wow. lsn't that ironic that he liked you,
and now you like--?
l get it!
All right, as long as it's under control.
You can't do anything about it.
He's already dating her.
She is a nice person.
That wouldn't be right.
l know, l know. So it's just not a big deal.
So can we keep this between us?
Sure.
Great, because l gotta get out of here.
The smell of beets is killing me.
Any chance Charlie has a deaf twin?
Hi, honey.
Hey.
l brought a friend home for dinner.
This is Zack from work.
Oh, of course.
lt's so nice to see you again, Zack.
You too.
You guys haven't actually met before.
But, boy, you're both polite.
Have a seat. l'll get you a beer.
l got it.
Thanks.
So Zack's pretty nice, huh?
Yeah, l guess.
So how would you like to have a baby
that's half yours and half his?
Excuse me?
We're talking about sperm donors,
and Zack may be the guy.
Look. He's intelligent, he's healthy,
he's athletic.
l mean, he's sperm-tastic!
Chandler, this is crazy.
Well, what did you even say to him?
''Come up. Meet my wife.
Give us your sperm.''
l invited him to dinner
so you'd get a chance to get to know him.
I mean, if we go through with a sperm bank,
you never meet the guy,
get to check him out.
Chandler!
l'm telling you, he's great.
l mean, even if my sperm worked fine,
l think he'd be the way to go.
l'm not going to be a part of this.
You can't bring some random guy home
and expect him to be our sperm donor.
Okay.
Zack?
Thanks.
Do you have a coaster?
l don't want to make a ring.
Tell me about yourself, Zack.
Oh, God, do you think she heard?
lt'd be so bad if she heard.
Maybe she didn't hear.
l'll go into that dressing room and talk.
You stay in here.
and I'll talk and see if you can hear me.
Okay, great.
Oh, thank God,
l can't hear a word that you're saying.
l didn't say anything yet.
Well, get back in there and talk.
l'm Rachel.
lt's so annoying
when l put Emma on the phone
to talk with my friends.
What?
Well, some things are just hard
to say to your face.
Okay, well, l heard that.
Which means that she heard it too.
We have a problem.
Oh, what are we gonna do?
Just be honest with her.
Oh, my God!
And it is annoying when parents
put their baby on the phone...
All right, enough out of you!
Hello?
l need to talk to Charlie.
ls she there?
No, she went shopping with Rachel.
Why? What's up?
l'm meeting with Professor Sherman
about my being the keynote speaker.
How's it going?
lt could be better.
He fell asleep.
What? But l already bought
my ticket to Bermuda!
Barbados.
Fine, l'll rent a car and drive.
You have to get that job.
What am l supposed to do?
He's out cold.
ln fact,
he was just talking in his sleep before...
...and evidently he wants someone named Fran
to ''spank him harder.''
Well, just wake him up.
l can't.
lf he realizes that l'm the one
who put him to sleep, l won't get the job.
That's a tough one.
Oh, wait a minute.
This happened to me before.
Yeah, l was auditioning for a play,
and the producer fell asleep. l--
No, wait a minute.
lt was me who fell asleep.
l mean, hey, Shakespeare,
how about a chase scene once in a while?
Hey, guys, dinner's ready.
l'm gonna go wash up first.
Thanks.
What do you think?
l want his genes for my kid.
Those eyes, those cheekbones.
Okay, there's enthusiastic,
and there's just plain gay.
You don't like him.
l think he's fine.
But we don't know anything real about him.
l wish we could get more information.
All right, just follow my lead.
You guys have a great place here.
Thanks. l'm crazy about our place.
Hey, speaking of crazy...
...do you have a history
of mental illness in the family?
No. Although, l did have an uncle
who voted for Dukakis.
That's really not the kind of thing
we're looking for.Zack.
Okay.
So tell me, how'd you guys meet?
Oh, friends first, drunk in London,
you know the story.
l've got a better question for you:
Do you or any of your
blood relatives have diabetes?
No.
Heart disease? Alzheimer's? Gout?
You guys don't have people
for dinner a lot, huh?
We're just making conversation.
Yeah, well, okay. l heard a joke today.
lt's pretty funny.
You know what's not funny?
Male pattern baldness.
You guys have shown a lot of interest in me tonight,
and l'm flattered...
...and quite frankly, a little frightened.
Can we just talk about something else?
Sure.
All right.
This ravioli's delicious.
l notice you're enjoying that ravioli
with a beautiful set of teeth.
Did you have braces as a child?
No, l didn't.
Yes!
We're teeth people, Zack.
All right.Let's just do it.
Let's just go over there and see if she heard.
Good plan.
Okay.
What? Where are you going?
Oh, l'm sorry, Rachel.
l don't have time
for your childish games, okay?
l still have to find
something incredible to wear...
...so l can beat Mike
at ''Who's More Over Who'' !
Where have you been?
Trying on clothes.
Oh, really? ln the dressing room?
Well, that's so weird.
Phoebe and l were in the dressing room.
Gosh, it's just such a small world.
Rachel, l heard you two guys whispering.
Oh, God, you did, you heard.
Okay, look, let me explain.
There's nothing to explain.
l heard you.
Phoebe likes Joey.
Yeah.
l don't understand it.
l mean, Phoebe likes Joey...
...and then she's here to buy a dress
to impress another guy?
Yeah, that's Phoebe.
That's Phoebe. You know,
she just wants them all.
lt's, like, she's nympho.
Wow!
Yeah.
You know, by the way,
l heard you tell her not to do anything.
Thanks for sticking up for me.
God, you are such a nice person.
l try.
Oh, my God, you really want me
to be the keynote speaker?
Thank you!
You're welcome.
Wow! You look...
...stop-eating hot!
Which is like the highest level of hotness.
Okay, are you sure?
Because l am really dreading going to this party.
Then don't go.
Mike knows l'm coming.
lf l don't show up,
he'll think it's because of him...
...and then l'm gonna lose face.
That's a very serious thing in my culture.
All right, then you go to that party,
and you pretend to be over Mike.
Afterward, you come to my place
and l'll get you good and drunk.
You got it. Okay.
But not on the wine that you made, okay?
Because l just don't want to
go back to the emergency room.
David?
Phoebe! Hi.
Oh, my God!
Hi.
Wow! You look unbelievable.
Oh, yeah, well....
What are you doing here?
Well, l'm back from Minsk. Permanently.
Well, what happened?
Remember how l was trying to achieve...
...the positronic distillation of subatomic particles?
Yeah.
Well, after eight years of research,
l discovered...
...that it can't be done.
Well...
...great that you're back.
How are you?
Good. Good. Life is good.
Good.
Well, l'm seeing someone.
Good for you.
Yeah.
She's also a scientist,
so she's very smart and pretty and....
lt's actually because of you really
that we're together.
l mean, l saw what you had
with that Mike guy...
...and l just said, ''Boy, l want that.''
Mike and l broke up.
You're kidding me.
Because l'm not seeing anybody.
l just totally made that up.
Really?
l don't know why,
l'm sorry.
l guess l just didn't want to lose face.
l understand.
Yeah. Okay. So then, okay....
So we're both living in New York,
not seeing anyone.
That's so not like us.
Yeah, l know.
Well, this is probably a stupid question,
seeing that you look like that...
...but do you have someplace
that you need to be right now?
Well....
No.
Well, do you want to get a drink?
l'd love to.
Great.
Okay.
Do you smell beets?
All right, stay upwind of me.
Hey, there's Phoebe.
ls that Mike she's with?
No, that's David.
There's a third guy?
Tip of the iceberg.
l'm gonna take off now.
You're gonna let me go home, aren't you?
Sure you don't want to stay a little longer?
No, l should get home.
l'm kind of tired.
Are you just tired now?
Or are you always tired?
Because that could be
a sign of clinical depression.
No, it's tiring to figure out the age at
which all my grandparents died.
l'll see you tomorrow.
Okay.
Bye.
l think we found our sperm.
He does seem pretty perfect.
Yeah? You think so?
Should l ask him?
No.
Why not?
Just because his
great-grandmother was obese?
Our kid's gonna get that from you anyway.
No, that's not it.
lt's just that when we were asking him
all those questions before...
...l just realized l don't care
if he is the most perfect guy in the world.
He's not you.
Yeah, he's better!
No, he's not.
lf l can't get pregnant with you,
then l don't want to get pregnant by him...
...or anyone else.
Really? Are you sure?
Yeah, l'm sure.
Thank God,
because l don't wanna do this either.
l was just doing it
because l thought that was what you wanted.
You know, l'm the husband.
l'm supposed to bring the sperm.
That is so sweet.
l love you.
So you know this leaves us with....
Adoption.
How do you feel about that?
l think l feel okay about it.
Actually, l think l feel really good about it.
Me too.
l wanna find a baby that needs a home,
and l wanna raise it with you.
And l wanna mess it up
in our own specific way.
So this is it?
We're really gonna adopt?
Yeah.
Oh, my God! We're gonna be parents!
We are gonna be great parents.
And it could be soon.
l mean, think about it.
Right now, somewhere out there...
...our baby could be being conceived.
Wait. lf we're lucky,
and we're really, really, really quiet...
...we may be able to hear
the sound of a condom breaking.
Hey, Zack.
Hey, Chandler.
l wanted to apologize for last night.
l got the feeling we made you a little uncomfortable.
No, you didn't.
Really?
No, you did.
My wife and l have some boundary issues.
Sometimes we ask inappropriate questions.
We're working on it.
Here are the boards for Friday's pitch.
Thank you.
You wouldn't know if Jeanette's planning on
keeping her baby, would you?
Hey! l'm all packed and ready to go.
That's right.
Daddy and Uncle Joey are going on a trip today.
We're going to a conference in Barbados.
Right? Can you say, ''Barbados''?
Barbados.
Okay. l've gotta say,
it means so much to me
that you guys are coming...
...all the way over there
to hear me give my speech.
And l have a surprise.
l had to pull some strings...
...but l was able to get everyone passes
to the entire conference. That's right!
These babies will get you into
all the paleontology lectures and seminars.
Do you have anything
that will get us out of them?
We're excited to hear the speech,
but the rest of the time...
...we're gonna want to do island stuff.
David will probably want to hear a few lectures.
Right, because he's a scientist.
No, no.
He's been in Minsk for eight years.
lf he gets too much direct sunlight...
...he'll die.
Okay, we'd better go.
Yeah?
So we'll see you guys tomorrow.
All right, let's do it.
A five-hour flight with Charlie,
have a couple drinks...
...get under that blanket
and do what comes natural.
lt's a blanket, Joe,
not a cloak of invisibility.
Friends S09E23E24 The One In Barbados
Wow, this place is beautiful!
Look at all these paleontologists!
l know.
There are gonna be some pasty folks
by the pool tomorrow.
My God,
l can't believe you're here!
l think l've been recognized.
This happens all the time.
Dr.Geller? l am such a huge fan.
That never happens.
l've been following your career for years.
l can't wait for your keynote speech.
Wow! This is very flattering.
l would love your autograph.
Well, sure.
''Dear...?''
Sarah.
''Sarah. l dig you.''
''Dr. Ross Geller.''
Oh, thank you so much.
Sure. Sarah, l'd like you to introduce you
to my colleague, Professor Wheeler.
And this is Joey Tribbiani.
Are you a paleontologist?
No, God, no, no. l'm an actor.
You probably recognize me from a little show
called The Days of Our Lives.
Dude, it's just Days of Our Lives.
There's no ''the.''
Okay, Ross.
Boy, you.... Yeah.
No, no. l play Dr. Drake Ramoray.
l'm sorry. l don't own a TV.
You don't own a TV?
What's all your furniture pointed at?
David, can you help me?
l'm trying to explain to Chandler
how a plane stays in the air.
Certainly.
That's a combination of Bernoulli's Principle...
...and Newton's third law of motion.
See?
Yeah.
That's the same as,
''lt has something to do with wind.''
l'm gonna go pick up
a few things for the trip.
l should go too.
Now, tomorrow do you guys want to share a cab to the airport...
That's a blast from the past, huh?
No, it's okay. Honest mistake.
lt really doesn't mean anything.
l mean, you know...
...Monica refers to Chandler
as Richard all the time.
She does?
Let's get you out of here.
Well, at least you took me down with you.
l'm so sorry.
l just-- l keep thinking about Mike.
l'm crazy about David,
and we're having so much fun together.
Why? Why do l miss Mike?
That's just-- That's gonna go away, right?
Well, l guess. ln time.
Yeah.
l mean, my feelings for Richard
are certainly gone.
You just did it again.
Chandler.
Your feelings for Chandler
are certainly gone.
Boy, Phoebe's still pretty hung up on that Mike, huh?
l wouldn't read too much into it.
Still, a girl calls you
by her ex-boyfriend's name...
...that's not a good thing, right?
David, let me stop you there.
Because l think l see where this is going.
l'm not very good at giving advice.
See, if you want advice,
go to Ross or Monica. Or Joey...
...for advice about pizza toppings
or a burning sensation when you pee.
l'm sorry,
l just wish there was something l could do,
you know?
Well, you know Phoebe--
Seriously, we're gonna do this?
l'm sorry,
l just wish l could make her
forget about Mike already.
Why did Phoebe and Mike break up?
Because his penis was too big.
l'm sorry. That's the kind of thing l do.
They broke up because
Mike didn't want to get married.
What if you let Phoebe know
you'd be open to marriage?
That's great. That's great. l'll propose to her.
What?
l was probably going to do it at some point.
No, l didn't mean now.
Well, why not? lt's brilliant.
''Goodbye, Mike.
We'll see you at the wedding, fella.
Well, we probably won't invite you to the wedding,
but--''
Well, thank you, Chandler. Sincerely.
Well, you're welcome.
Glad l could help.
How do you think l should propose?
David, l'm pretending to read here.
l'm sorry.
Yeah. How you doing?
Hey, how are you?
You said you were gonna wear a thong.
Where's the thong?
l didn't mean a thong.
l meant thongs.
You really should have been more clear about that.
You're never gonna guess
who l just saw downstairs.
Britney Spears!
Yeah. She never misses
these conferences.
No, l just saw Dr. Kenneth Schwartz!
Oh, my God!
l know!
Did you talk to him?
Oh, yeah. What am l
gonna say to Kenneth Schwartz?
You could say,
''Hey, Kenny,
how come you're not Britney Spears?''
You ready to go?
You're gonna go now?
l thought we could hang out.
l can't. l have seminars all day.
l promised Ross l'd look at his speech.
But maybe we could have dinner later?
Out on the balcony?
lt'll be romantic.
Will you wear a thong?
l will if you will.
You got yourself a very weird deal.
l'm good. l have dinner plans.
So you gonna be okay?
Yeah, yeah.
l got tons of stuff l could do.
l'm gonna hit the beach, go swimming.
Joe, have you looked outside?
No. Why?
Oh, man.
There's an indoor pool.
You could swim there.
Yeah.
l wasn't gonna swim. l was gonna dig a hole.
That Mike thing was interesting.
l don't know what's gonna happen...
...with Phoebe and David.
l do. Want a hint, huh?
l do.
l do.
Okay, l'm sensing this is
some kind of wordplay...
...because you are pink
with barely controlled glee.
David's gonna propose to Phoebe.
What? Why?
Because we were talking about ways
he could beat Mike...
...and l told him Phoebe
wanted to get married.
Chandler, we have talked about this.
You are not supposed to give people advice!
Couldn't you have made some inappropriate joke?
l did!
A penis one!
Just so l know,
what was so wrong about what l said?
They've only been going out for a few weeks.
Phoebe is completely hung up on Mike.
l mean, she'll say no...
...David's heart will be broken,
it'll be too hard for them to recover...
...and then Phoebe will end up alone again.
Man, that's some bad advice.
Oh, hey. Thank God. You guys are here.
What's going on?
Everything is upside-down here.
lt rains all day long and nobody watches TV,
and Ross is famous.
l don't want to alarm anybody...
...but Monica's hair is twice as big as it was
when we landed.
Okay. When l go places with high humidity...
...it gets a little extra body, okay?
That's why our honeymoon photos
look like me and Diana Ross.
l'll show you guys where to check in.
Oh, honey?
Can you make sure we get a king-size bed?
Oh, David, get one for us too. Oh,
and see if they have a heart-shaped one.
And with mirrors on the ceiling.
And make sure our room
isn't next to theirs.
Oh, you guys are so lucky
you're here with people.
You know, it's just such a romantic place.
l just wish l could share it with a guy.
Not Joey.
Not Joey. No.
l was just lusting after Chandler.
Yeah, right.
So.... l'm proposing to Phoebe tonight.
Tonight?
lsn't an engagement ring supposed to have a diamond?
Oh, there it is.
Yes, well, being a failed scientist
doesn't pay quite as well as you might think.
That's one-seventieth of a carat.
And the clarity is quite poor.
Nice.
Monica, can l talk to you for a second?
Okay.
David's gonna propose to Phoebe tonight.
See what happens
when you give people advice?
Well, l hope you told him not to.
That would be advice!
Okay, fine. l'll handle this.
Phoebe?
Yeah?
l need to talk to you.
Are you leaving the Supremes?
Okay, my husband just gave your boyfriend
some very bad advice.
David's gonna propose to you tonight.
Wow, really?
That's fantastic!
What? Are you serious?
You want to marry him?
What about Mike?
Oh, okay, you want me to marry Mike?
Let's just gag him and handcuff him...
...and force him down the aisle, okay?
l can just see it.
''Mike, do you take Phoebe?''
You know? lt's every girl's dream.
Do you really think
marrying someone else is the right answer?
Sure. Look, okay, bottom line?
l love Mike-- David!
David! l love David.
Don't look at me that way,
Roseanne Roseannadanna.
''By using CT scans and computer imaging,
we can, in a very real way...
...bring the Mesozoic Era into the 21 st century.''
lt's great.
You'll be the hit of the conference.
lt'll be even better tomorrow...
...because l won't be constantly interrupted by Joey...
...checking to see
if they put chocolates on my pillow yet.
Hey, guys.
The chocolates aren't here.
Damn it!
Ross just read me his speech.
lt's fantastic.
Oh, is it on the computer?
Because l'd love to give it a read.
lf you want to check your e-mail, just ask.
What? May l?
What's with the rain, Geller?
l mean, when l signed up for dino week...
...nobody said anything about it being monsoon season.
The wet season is June to December.
lt's not the time, Charlie.
Oh, no. No, no! Dear God, no!
What,
did someone outbid you for the teapot?
Secret teapot.
Your computer.
l don't know what-- Everything's gone.
What do you mean?
Must be a virus.
l think it erased your hard drive.
What? Oh, my God. What did you do?
Someone l don't know sent me an e-mail
and l opened it.
Why? Why would you open it?
Well, it didn't say, ''This is a virus.''
What did it say?
''Nude--''
"Pictures of Anna Kournikova."
l'm so sorry.
What am l gonna do?
My speech is gone! Chandler.
lt's not gone.
l'm sure you printed out a copy.
You have a hard copy? Right?
No, l don't!
Well, you must be pretty mad at yourself right now.
lt's really gone?
Yep.
l'd like to thank you guys for coming down here...
...to complain about the rain
and ruin my career.
l just feel awful.
Yeah, you should.
Nude pictures of Anna Kournikova?
She's never even won a major tournament.
Well, l tried Billie Jean King, but--
You know, you and Monica have the same
l'm-gonna-kill-you look.
l can usually make it go away
by kissing her.
Get out.
You know, this happens all the time
to my computer at work.
What do you do?
l usually go...
...play Tetris on somebody else's computer.
l can't believe this is happening.
l have to give the keynote speech tomorrow.
l have to stand up in front of all these people.
What am l gonna say?
You can use a speech
l memorized for auditions.
l don't think your monologue from Star Wars
is gonna help me right now.
Ross, we can solve this.
l just heard your speech.
We can re-create it.
We've got all night.
What, you really think we can do that?
Oh, wait.
Joey and l are supposed to have dinner.
Don't worry about that.
l mean, Ross needs you.
Rachel and l will stay and help any way we can.
All right. Okay, let's do it.
Well, l know we start by
discussing the shortcomings of carbon dating.
And then l move on to
what is clearly the defining moment...
...of the Mesozoic Era,
the breakup of Pangaea. Hello?
And then there's the overview of the Triassic.
Any chance any of this happened
in a galaxy far, far away?
Hello?
Okay, Mike?
Enough is enough.
You love Phoebe, and she loves you.
So get over your
l-never-wanna-get-married thing...
...and step up!
Who is this?
This is Monica, Phoebe's friend.
Listen, Phoebe is back with David.
He's gonna propose,
and she's gonna say yes... ...but l know
she really wants to be with you.
He's gonna propose?
l'm sorry, did you say something?
l can't hear through all this damned hair!
lf Phoebe wants to marry David,
she should.
l'm not gonna stand in the way of that.
Neither should you.
You don't tell me what to do.
l tell you what to do.
Just call her.
She's at the Paradise Hotel in Barbados.
And while l've got you, you've got curly hair.
What do you do in the humidity?
Damn it!
Well, l hope you're happy.
l hope you're happy too, honey.
Phoebe's going to say yes to David.
That's what happens when you meddling people's lives.
Phoebe's gonna say yes? That's great.
No, it's not. She's still in love with Mike.
There's no chance that will work?
No, l called.
lt's not gonna happen.
Meddler! Meddler!
lf you hadn't meddled to start with...
...then l wouldn't have had to
go in and meddle myself.
No matter how much we meddle,
we'll never be able to unmeddle...
...the thing that you meddled up in the first place!
This vacation sucks!
l'm so bored.
Stupid rain.
We can't do anything.
Well, l brought some books.
We could read.
Hey, it hasn't come to that yet.
Hey, hey, hey, don't mind if l do.
l'm sorry, sir,
these are for the pharmaceutical convention.
You feel like going to a convention?
We can't.
We're not pharmacists.
l know we're not...
...but Frank Madaio and Eva....
Kate Miller.
Kate Miller it is.
Okay.
Oh, good--
And that's the most sex
l'm gonna have this weekend.
Well, in that case,
should l make sure it's on real good?
Thank you.
Oh, and then you said that
thing about bringing the Mesozoic Era...
...into the 21 st century.
Well, yeah. That's it?
Oh, my God. We did it.
Actually, l did it, ross.
You remembered shockingly little
of your own speech.
Yes, but l did make a pyramid
out of the bath products.
Oh, this is amazing. Thank you.
Thank you so much.
That's a pretty necklace.
Thank you.
Hey, what do you say we celebrate?
Champagne?
Yeah! Save the cork,
and that way, we can fill the bottle with water...
...and put it back so they don't charge you.
Oh, my God, l love you.
This is such a cute picture of Emma.
And is this your son...
...or just some kid whose picture
you bring on vacation?
That's Ben, my son from my first marriage.
Your first marriage?
Yeah.
You've been married more than once?
No.
So why'd you break up?
Oh, it was--
lt's complicated, you know? She was...
...gay.
Oh, my God.
This is so cool!
Okay. Odd thing to get excited about.
No, it's just that l was engaged to a guy
who turned out to be gay.
Hey! High-five!
Didn't you feel so stupid
that you didn't see the signs?
My fiance was always going on
long weekends with his ''tennis partner.''
My wife had a workout friend
she went to the gym with every day for a year.
She didn't get any fitter.
Everybody's like, ''l knew all along.''
l know. lf you knew, why didn't you tell me?
l mean, call, leave a note.
''Hi. Just dropped by to say your wife's gay.''
l know.
And then--
And then you try to make the best of a bad situation...
...so you float the idea of a threesome.
l didn't do that.
Me neither.
Well, who knew?
Pharmacists are fun.
l know. That old lady at the end
was ready to take you home.
Not enough pills in the world, Rach.
What about you, huh? You're the single one.
See anybody in there you like?
Well, let's see.
There was that really big guy
that l was talking to...
...with the really nice breasts.
But what about back home?
Anything going on there?
Anybody you like?
No.
There is. You're blushing.
No, l'm not blushing...
...and l'm sunburned.
From, you know, the rain.
You like someone. Tell me who.
No. Joey.
Who do you like?
You're not getting away that easy.
Who do you like?
Joey, come on!
lt doesn't matter, you know?
lt's not like anything's gonna happen.
What? Why not?
Rach, who can you not get?
Okay. Okay.
You really want to know who it is?
Yeah. Who is it?
Do you?
Oh, hey.
l just left you a message.
Ross and l were gonna go grab a bite...
...but now that you're here,
we could have that dinner.
Right! Of course.
Hey, did you guys finish the speech?
Yep! We got it. We got it.
Thank you so much.
l had a great time.
Yeah.
This isn't over,
because l really want to know--
Later. Later.
So shall we?
Yeah.
Okay.
Good night.
Good night.
Okay, good night.
Good night, Ross.
l can't believe she's gonna say yes to David.
She's clearly in love with Mike.
You know, it's very hard to
take you seriously when you look like that.
Phoebe, l have something l want to say.
Oh, God, he's gonna do it.
l cannot watch this. Let's go.
l think we have time.
Have you heard him talk?
''Phoebe, l would be honored if--''
Spit it out, David!
Phoebe.
You're an amazing woman,
and the time we spent apart was unbearable.
Of course, the sanitation strikes
in Minsk didn't help.
Sure. Okay. Yeah.
But, well, now that we're together again,
l don't ever want to be apart.
So to that end....
Oh, my God, Mike.
lt's David, actually.
No, Mike's here.
Oh, hey, Mike.
Hi, David.
Chandler. Monic-- Oh!
lt's the humidity!
Hi, Phoebe.
What are you doing here?
l have a question l need to ask you.
l have a question
l was kind of gonna ask her myself.
Yeah, l understand, but before you do,
she really needs to hear this.
Okay.
Would you care for my seat as well?
Actually, yeah, that'd be great.
Well, that's fair,
you've had a long trip.
Phoebe, l love you.
l've missed you so much
these last few months.
l thought we were apart for a good reason...
...but l realized that
there was no reason good enough...
...to keep me from spending
the rest of my life with you.
Kind of steps on the toes of what l was going to say.
l'm sorry, David,
but she really has to know this.
All right, when you're through,
l want to see you outside.
lf it stops raining.
You're the most incredible woman l've ever met.
How could l lose you?
Now, l don't actually have a ring.
l have a ring.
l wouldn't brag about that, big guy.
But, Phoebe...
...will you marry me?
No.
l love you,
but l never needed a proposal from you.
l just needed to know we were headed somewhere.
That we had a future.
We can have any future you want.
Okay, well, l'm gonna take off.
David, l'm so sorry. l'm sorry.
Just so l know, if l had asked first...?
Yeah, l might have said yes,
but that would've been wrong.
Please, you don't have to explain.
l mean, perhaps if l hadn't gone to Minsk...
...things would have worked out for us,
and l wouldn't have ruined my career.
Or lost that toe to frostbite.
lt was a good trip.
ls it okay if l hug you now?
Oh, yes.
Because of our meddling! All right?
Oh, isn't this nice?
lt's so quiet. l could just lie here all day.
Oh, l know.
Open your drapes! Open your drapes!
So glad we got adjoining rooms.
The sun is out!
Hey! Remember when l had corneas?
Go to the pool and reserve chairs.
l will get the magazines and the lotion.
Ladies? Ross' speech is in 45 minutes.
No!
Damn it!
Walls are pretty thin, guys.
''Then we have to weigh the data from recent MRl scans
and DNA testing...
...which call into question information
gathered from years of carbon dating.''
Look at the woman sitting out
by the pool getting tan.
She's all leathery and wrinkled.
l'm so jealous!
''Finally, factor in the profusion of new species recently discovered.
Giganotosaurus.
Argentinosaurus.''
Not to mention Coldsaurus.
''And that's just the herbivores.
l'm not even gonna discuss the carnivores.
Their heads are already too big.
Which is ironic,
considering their stunted cerebral development.''
Really?
''But all kidding aside,
in much the same way...
...that Homo ergaster is thought to be
a separate species from Homo erectus....''
What?
He said "erectus."
You're kidding, right?
No, he really said it.
''And while there are certainly vast differences...
...between these Mesozoic fossils
and the example of Homo erectus....''
Erectus?
Homo.
Right.
''ln a very real way,
we can bring the Mesozoic Era
into the 21 st century.''
Thank you.
Really great.
Oh, thanks, guys.
l thought it was wonderful.
Jarvis Oberblau. Cornell.
l mean, the ideas you put forth,
and from someone so young and....
Okay, now we're just holding hands.
Alrighty. We're gonna hit the beach.
That was really great.
Oh, thank you.
Yeah. Oh, and so funny.
Take it easy.
All right, thanks. Thanks so much.
l can't tell you how much it means
that you were here.
You kidding? We wouldn't have missed it.
l'm back.
Okay. Well, excuse me?
Well?
You were incredible.
You blew them away.
l can't tell you how great it was
to look in the crowd and see your face.
l mean, did you know you were
mouthing the words along with me?
l was not.
No, it's okay.
lt made me feel like a rock star.
Oh, my God.
l'm your groupie.
Hey, l better not find you naked
in my hotel room.
Look, l took it too far.
l can't believe it's raining again.
lt's so unfair.
Well, on the bright side,
now we won't have to see...
...all these paleontologists with their shirts off.
Not you guys.
You've got it going on.
What will we do today?
They have a game room downstairs.
They have Ping-Pong and stuff.
Ping-Pong? Honey, they have Ping-Pong.
Let's play.
l don't think so.
Why not?
You know how competitive you get.
And while l say it's cute,
others disagree, and l'm lying.
l'm not always that bad.
Oh, yeah?
What happened when we played last time?
l punched you.
And?
Phoebe.
And?
l clunked your heads together.
There you are.
Hey. Listen.
As soon as it stops raining,
we have got to go snorkeling.
Some kid told me about this sea turtle.
lf you blow bubbles in his face...
...he chases you.
l'm sorry, l can't.
l'm running a discussion group all afternoon.
That's okay. l'll find someone else to do it.
l'd do it alone, but...
...l don't know what happens
if the sea turtle catches you.
You know, l feel so bad.
l haven't seen you this whole trip.
Especially last night--
Don't worry about it. lt was fine.
l end up had the best time with Rachel.
l just felt bad for you,
stuck in that room working on Ross' speech.
Actually, it turned out to be a lot of fun.
Oh, well, at least
we're both having fun, right?
ls it weird that it's not with each other?
Yeah.
A little bit, yeah.
l think we need to talk.
Yeah, l think we do.
About what?
Come on, you guys, it'll be fun!
All right.
l'll play if we don't keep score.
Well, then how do we know who wins?
Nobody wins.
So we're just four losers. Super.
Well, l'm not playing with her.
l'm out.
l'll play you.
Okay.
You don't know what you're doing.
She gets crazy.
This scar? That's from Pictionary.
l think l'll be all right.
You want to volley a bit for serve?
Sure, if you want to.
Oh, by the way, l'm awesome.
Oh, dear God, there's two of them.
You ready to play?
Hell, yeah.
Did you know this about him?
No idea. l thought he was soft like you.
Want to make it more interesting?
How much you thinking?
Ten bucks a game?
Make it 50.
l'll make it 1 00.
One thousand--
Okay!
We'll flip to see who goes first.
You got a quarter?
No. Either of you girls got a quarter?
Honey, try to focus the trash talk on him.
Monica, you call it.
Heads. No, tails! Heads!
Tails.
Oh, what are the chances?
My point!
Oh, no, l don't think so.
According the standard rules:
lf at any time a player
uses his nonracket-bearing hand...
...to touch the playing surface,
he or she forfeits the point.
He was a lawyer.
All the East Coast is having beautiful weather.
ln New York, it's 72 and sunny.
Weather bitch.
lt's open.
Hi, Joe.
Hey.
What? ls everything okay?
Charlie and l broke up.
No. Why?
Well, she said we have nothing in common.
That's crazy.
No, it's not. We have nothing in common.
Yeah, that's true.
Yeah.
l mean, she should be
with someone more like Ross. You know,
l mean he uses all those big words too.
Man, smart people are dull.
Well, hey!
Okay, Rach.
l feel so stupid, you know?
Why do l keep going after the wrong girls?
What are you talking about?
Oh, come on.
l mean, there's you,
then there's Charlie.
lt's like.... What the hell's my problem?
l just....
Okay. Maybe you're not always
going after the wrong girl.
l'm telling you, Rach,
Charlie is not right for me.
l'm not talking about her.
Well, then, who?
The waitress l went out with last month?
You know what? Forget it.
No, no, no, no.
Who are you talking about?
No, l don't--
l actually don't know
who l'm talking about, so....
Okay.
Yeah.
Well, l'm gonna go see
if l can get a room for tonight.
And l'll see you later.
Yeah, sure. Okay.
You like me?
Okay.
Let's not make a big thing about this.
lt's a huge thing!
Okay, not working with me, Joe.
Look, here's the thing.
Lately, l have been having thoughts.
Musings, if you will.
Well, for how long?
Oh, only like a month.
A month?
Well--
Dial it down.
Listen, maybe they're crazy thoughts,
but sometimes l do.
l have been thinking about, you know, us.
Okay, dial it up a little.
Oh, you're right. Okay.
l just have a question. Shoot.
What the hell are you doing?
l'm not trying to do anything.
lt's just, we have such a good time
when we're together, you know?
And l mean, aren't you just a little curious
what it would be like?
Am l curious? l mean, l'm as curious as...
...George!
Who?
Curious George! You know,
the monkey and the guy with the yellow hat.
Yes. Of course. l remember him.
He had a paper route.
Yeah, he did.
See, this is what l'm talking about.
No, l know. We're great!
But, Rach, no, this can't happen.
Can't it just happen a little bit?
No! lt can't happen at all!
Why not?
Because, look,
no one wants this to happen more than me, okay?
l have gone over this moment
in my head 100 times...
...and not once did l ever say no.
l couldn't do it to Ross.
But that wasn't gonna stop you before.
l know. l know...
...but l've thought about it a lot since then,
and it just wouldn't be right.
l'm sorry.
l'm sorry too.
Oh, God, l shouldn't have said anything.
No, no.
No, no, no, no. Hey, we'll be fine.
Like you said, it's no big deal.
lt's not a big deal.
No big deal.
lt's so not a big deal.
l'll see you later. All right, hey.
Okay, great.
Okay--
Oh, l'm sorry, l think--
l think that may have missed the table.
Oh, do you?
Yeah. Do you?
Yeah. Do you?
Yeah!
You really find this attractive on him?
Oh, yeah.
Are you telling me you're not even a little turned on
by Monica right now?
This is the first time in our marriage
that l've felt like the more attractive one.
All right, come on, Mike.
You can beat her.
Knock that dog off her head.
Damn it!
l sleep with him!
Game point.
Don't get too cocky.
Remember, l won the last one.
Oh, by the way,
how did that feel, losing to a girl?
You should look in the mirror
before you call yourself that.
No! No! No!
And that's how it's done.
Okey-dokey.
You've each won a game,
and l've lost what's felt like a year of my life.
Everybody goes home a winner.
Best of three?
That's what l'm thinking.
Should l use my invisibility
to fight crime or for evil?
Serve the ball, chump.
''Serve the ball, chump.''
Okay, better comebacks,
Mike. Better comebacks.
l'm just saying,
l have a cabin in the Adirondacks.
lf you ever want to get away from the city, well,
that'd be...
...just nifty.
Well, l've kind of got a lot on my plate right now.
Not that l wouldn't love a weekend
in the country with a strange man.
Jarvis?
Oh, you're back.
This is my wife, Nancy.
Well, get out!
Ross? Can l talk to you for a minute?
Yes, please.
So, what's going on?
Well, Joey and l broke up.
Oh, my God. What happened?
Joey is a great guy...
...but we're just--
We're so different.
l mean, like, during your speech,
he kept laughing at ''Homo erectus.''
l knew that was him!
Anyway, l just....
l think it's for the best.
Hey. Hey, you okay?
l guess.
There was....
There was another reason that
l thought it was time to end it with Joey.
l started to realize that
l was having feelings for someone else.
Okay, Geller. Last day of the conference.
You know what happens to the keynote speaker.
Professor Klarik,
we're in the middle of a conversation here.
Can't you throw him in the pool later?
Or we could throw you both in now.
Okay, gentlemen, please.
Aren't we a little old for this?
l mean, we're scientists, all right?
We're academics...
...and most importantly,
you will have to catch us first.
Go! Go! Go!
Okay, so it's tied again, 41 to 41 .
Okay, look, enough is enough.
No.
l just have two more points to beat him.
Monica, that was also true an hour ago!
l mean, please, look at you.
Your hand is blistered,
you can barely stand,
your hair is inexplicable!
You've already proven
you're just as good as he is.
We missed our dinner reservations,
so let's just go upstairs...
...order room service,
take a shower and shave your head!
l can't just walk away.
l've put in four hours.
You knew this about me
when you married me.
You agreed to take me
in sickness and in health.
Well, this is my sickness!
What about the obsessive cleaning?
That's just good sense.
You okay?
No, honey, l'm okay.
Shake it off.
Oh, no shaking....
Oh, my God. l can't play.
So you forfeit?
Mike wins?
l can't believe it. l lost.
No, you didn't.
What?
Because l'm gonna play for you.
You can't do that.
lt's okay.
l don't care which of them l beat.
Okay, we're taking that paddle home, mister.
Honey, you don't have to do this.
Yes, l do.
l may not understand
why you have to win so badly...
...but if it's important to you,
it's important to me.
Because l love you.
But you suck.
You're welcome, sweetheart.
All right, let's get this over with.
Sudden death.
Whoever wins this point, wins.
Okay.
Oh, my God. You're good.
lt's like watching porn.
And that's how it's done.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. That was so amazing.
Well, when did you--?
Hold on, l almost forgot. Loser.
When did you stop sucking?
l never sucked.
l just didn't want you...
Why?
l don't know.
Well, this is so great.
Now we can enter doubles tournaments.
That's why.
They still looking for us?
Yeah.
The bartender said
they split up into two search parties.
The herbivores and the carnivores.
You know, we, as a group, are not the coolest.
Oh, look out.
l don't think they saw us.
l don't think they did.
So l started to tell you something earlier.
There was another reason that
l realized it was time to end it with Joey.
l kind of realized
l was starting to have feelings...
...for someone else.
And can l ask who?
l think you know.
l think l know too,
but l've been really wrong
about this stuff in the past, so....
l'm sorry, we can't.
All right. All right.
l mean, you just went out
with my best friend, you know?
l just think
it would be a really, really bad idea.
Or not. l mean--
What?
