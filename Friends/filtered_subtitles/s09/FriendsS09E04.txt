那是谁的错呢012---And whose fault is that?
又没有什么大不了的012---What's the big deal?
你忘了  她忘了012---You forgot,she forgot.
或许那晚你床上表现不佳  嘿012--- Maybe you were having an off night.  Hey!

再约她出去呢012---and ask her out again?
你们都是荡货012---You're both so slutty,
你们根本都不记得跟谁上过床012---you don't remember who you slept with.
你们是天生的一对012---You're made for each other.
真有趣012---Interesting.
好吧  我会再跟她出去012---Well,I'll go out with her again
然后忘了过去012---and I'll try to get past it.
不能吃盐  会胀气012---No salt! Bloaty!
乔伊 干嘛012--- Joey?  What?

我想他会离开的012---Which he will.
而这一切都没有关系012---And,you know,that's okay.
我只不过会永远孤单而已012---So I'll just be alone forever.
都没关系了  一切都会没事的012---You know,all right. It'll be fine. It'll be fine.
我就跟寡妇还有同性恋一起出去玩嘛012---I'll go on walking tours with widows and lesbians.
