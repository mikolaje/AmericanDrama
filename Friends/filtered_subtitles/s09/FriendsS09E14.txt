-室友早  -早012---- Morning, roomie.  - Hey!
你今天早上终于记得穿衣服了012---You remembered to put clothes on this morning.
事不过五嘛012---Fifth day's a charm.
乔伊  能搬回来真好012---Oh Joey, it's so great to be back here.
你真帮了我跟艾玛一个大忙012---You're making it so easy on me and Emma.
你能回来也很好012---It's great having you back.
要待多久就待多久012---Stay as long as you want.
就是她什么时候才不会012---And when does she stop
整宿的哭呢012---crying all night?
你居然没有光着屁股012---Hey! You're not naked.
瑞秋  你今晚什么时候回来012---Rach, when will we expect to see you tonight?
我大概六点回来吧012---I probably be back around 6.
她在房间里呢  已经收拾好了012---But she's in the bedroom, all ready to go.
可她又睡着了  所以012---But she did fell back to sleep, so
她可能因为昨晚忙着012---She's probably exhausted from
制造美妙的哭声累坏了012---all that adorable screaming she did last night.
-再见  -再见012---- Bye.  - Bye.
希望艾玛没有给你带来太多麻烦012---Hey, I hope Emma isn't making it too hard on you.
没  一切都很好012---No, hey, it's been great.
我得跟你说  虽然瑞秋住在这012---I just want you to know that with Rachel staying here...
但是我之前对她的感觉  已经没了012---all my feelings from before are totally over.
即使本来还有012---And even if they weren't
当你看到一个女人用吸奶器012---when you walk in on a woman using a breast pump
-是啊  效果显着  -哇012---- Yeah, that'll do it.  - Wow!
那你怎样呢012---So how are you?
-不错啊  -真的吗012---- I'm okay.  - Really?
当然  要是问我  有没有希望过012---Sure. I mean, do I wish
可以和瑞秋幸福地生活在一起012---me and Rachel living together would have worked out?
当然有012---Of course. You know, I'm disappointed,
我只是有点失望  可毕竟这又不是离婚012---but it's not like it's a divorce.
事实上这…012---Well, actually it
这不是离婚  这不是离婚012---It's not a divorce. It is not a divorce!
反正我跟瑞秋  都应该过自己的新生活了012---Anyway, I think Rachel and I need to get on with our lives.
或许应该开始跟其他人交往012---Maybe start seeing other people.
哇  真的吗012---Wow. Really?
当然  为何不呢012---Sure, why not?
其实  你认不认识适合我的人012---In fact, if you know anyone that'd be good for me...?
当然  我认识很多女生012---Sure. I know lots of girls.
想到谁了  说个名字012---Any names come to mind?
还要名字012---Names?
《老友记》  第九季 第14集  相亲012---Friends S09E14 The One With The Blind Dates
我正要吃东西  你要吗012---I was about to eat. Want something?
有什么012---What you got?
我看看  有豆泥 胡萝卜泥…012---Okay, let's see, we got strained peas, strained carrots...
梅子泥  还没有试过这个012---strained plums. We haven't tried that yet!
好棒012---Goody!
谢谢012---Thanks.
跟瑞秋重新住一起感觉如何012---So how is it living with Rachel again?
当然  除了有很多好吃的之外012---I mean, apart from the great food?
很好  很好  只是...012---I'm fine, I'm fine. It's just....
她跟罗斯之间真的是很诡异012---It's just weird what's happening with her and Ross.
昨天他居然要我介绍女生给他012---Yesterday he asked me to fix him up with somebody.
瑞秋也问我有没有男生可以介绍给她012---Rachel asked me if I knew anyone for her too.
-他们为什么要这样呢  -不知道012---- Why are they doing this?  - I don't know.
他们彼此再适合不过了  真是神经012---They're so perfect for each other. It's crazy.
你知道什么才神经  这些罐子是怎样012---You know what's crazy?
才两口就没了012---These jars. It's like two bits in here?
真希望他们可以发现  他俩是天生一对012---I just wish they'd realize they should be together.
他们又住在一起的时候012---I know, I know. When they moved in together,
我以为事情就解决了012---I figured that's where things were headed.
我知道  他们应该是一家人012---I know. They should be a family.
结婚生更多的小孩012---They should marry and have more children.
是啊  还该把其中一个取名叫乔伊012---Yes. And they should name one of their kids Joey.
我或许不会有小孩012---I may not have kids.
总是要有人帮我把我的姓传下去012---Someone's gotta carry on the family name.
或许他们一旦开始跟别人约会012---You know what? Maybe once they start dating
知道别人是怎样的012---and see what's out there
他们就会发现彼此是多么适合012---they'll realize how good they are for each other.
因为他俩真是绝配啊012---Yeah, because it is slim pickings.
我昨晚约会的女生遭透了  讨厌012---I had this date last night. Yuck!
但我们说话小声点  她还在房间里012---But we should probably keep it down, she's still in the bedroom.
那我们该怎么办012---So, what are we gonna do?
难道真要帮他们介绍别人吗012---Are we just gonna set them up with people?
那只会使他们渐行渐远012---I know, that just pushes them further and further apart.
我知道要怎么做了012---I know what we can do.
我们帮罗斯跟瑞秋介绍糟糕的约会对象012---We could set Ross and Rachel up on horrible dates...
可以使他们意识到彼此才是归宿012---so they'll realize how good they are together.
-真是好计划  -没错012---- That's a great plan.  - Yeah.
你知道最棒的是什么吗012---You know what the best part of it is?
我终于可以用到计划笑声了012---I get to do my plan laugh.
停  不要那么大声  不要吵醒那个谁012---Okay, shh! Not so loud. We don't want to wake up
你们今晚没事  对吗012---Hi. You guys aren't doing anything tonight, are you?
你凭什么这么以为呢012---See, now, why would you assume that?
就因为我们是已婚吗012---Just because we're married?
我要让你知道 我们可是非常时髦又充实的012---I mean, I will have you know that we are very hip, happening people.
现在  不好意思012---Now if you'll excuse me,
我要继续读报上的讣告了012---I have to get back to reading the obituaries.
我就是问问  因为今晚我需要人帮我带艾玛012---I was just asking because I need someone to watch Emma tonight.
我们当然帮你带  你要干什么去012---Sure we'll do it. What are you up to?
菲比帮我安排一个约会012---Well, Phoebe set me up on a date.
我的天012---Oh, my God.
怎么了  有什么不对吗012---Why? What's the big deal?
我以为你跟罗斯是...012---I figured because you and Ross are--
是怎样  一年半前上过床吗012---What? Slept together a year and a half ago?
是啊  我已经好了012---Yeah, I'm all set.
我觉得你去约会是件好事012---I think it's great you're going on a date.
听起来很健康012---It sounds healthy.
你也有你的需要012---I mean, you have needs.
放手拥抱你的女性特质吧012---Embrace your womanhood.
你要找工作吗012---You want a job?
少看欧普拉  多投简历去012---Turn off Oprah and send out  resume.
我大概七点带她过来好吗012---I'll bring her by around 7, okay?
没问题012---That's perfect.
你们会过很开心的012---You guys are gonna have so much fun.
她现在正是可爱的时候012---She's at such a cute age.
几件事注意一下  现在她会吃固体食物了012---A couple things. Now that she eats solid food,
所以会按时排便012---she poops around the clock.
还有小心你的头发  她喜欢抓着不放012---And watch out for your hair because she likes to grab it.
她这个年龄阶段012---She's also in this phase
还会在你离开房间的时候拼命尖叫  但是...012---where if you leave the room, she screams, but....
谢啦  祝你们玩得开心012---Thanks, you guys. Have fun.
突然间  我希望读到讣告里有自己的名字012---Suddenly I wish I was reading my own name.
乔伊  我好兴奋012---Joey, hey. I'm so excited.
我给瑞秋找了一个最糟糕的男人012---I set Rachel up with the worst guy.
好的  他怎么样012---All right. Who is he?
是我按摩过的一个男客户  按摩时012---It's a guy I used to massage. By ''massage'' ...
我得按住他  让他不能转身露鸟012---I mean hold down so he wouldn't turn over and flash me.
等你听听我给罗斯介绍的谁再说吧012---Wait till you hear who I got for Ross.
喔  好啊012---Oh, yeah.
这个女人特别无聊  是个老师012---Okay. She's this really boring woman. She's a teacher.
老师012---A teacher?
她喜欢历史跟外国影片012---She's into history and foreign movies.
而且她还喜欢益智游戏012---And she loves puzzles.
拜托  谁会喜欢益智游戏呢012---Come on, who loves puzzles?
嗯  罗斯喜欢啊012---Well, Ross does.
你把计划给毁了012---You're ruining the plan!
乔伊  你这是要给他介绍完美伴侣呢012---Joey, you fixed him up with his perfect woman.
-我的天  你说的没错  -是啊012---- Oh, my God, you're right!  - Yeah.
她甚至还喜欢读书012---She even reads for pleasure!
你怎么会认识那种女人的012---How do you know a woman like that?
我就不能认识聪明的女人吗012---I'm not allowed to know smart women?
乔伊012---Joey?
我到图书馆里去上厕所认识的012---We met at the library. I went in to pee.
-那我们现在该怎么办呢  -嗯  好吧012---- So now what do we do?  - Well, okay.
我打电话跟她取消012---I'll call her and tell her the date's canceled
然后再找别人吧012---and find him somebody else.
要是我们不找别人呢012---What if we don't find him somebody else?
我们只跟女的说约会取消了012---We'll just tell her the date's off...
但是不告诉罗斯012---...but we don't tell Ross.
他就会在餐厅等着被放鸽子了012---He'll go to the restaurant and get stood up.
你好坏哦012---I hear that's bad.
太棒了  瑞秋会有个糟糕的约会012---So this is great. Rachel's gonna have a terrible date
罗斯被放鸽子012---Ross gets stood up,
之后  他们会意识到对方有多么好012---and then they'll realize how good they have it together.
是的  好计划012---Yes, the plan.
这不是圣诞老公公的计划012---It's not Santa's plan.
不  是这样…012---No, it's....
有点不太好玩了012---Yeah, you know, it's not that fun.
是不好玩  被我们弄僵了012---No, I think we killed it.
艾玛  看着我012---Emma? Emma, look at me!
那么  我要下楼待一会012---Well, I think I'll go downstairs for a while.
不要  没事的  我没有去012---No, no, no! It's okay! It's okay! I didn't go!
别哭  我是开玩笑的012---Don't cry, it's just a bit!
我是你的钱德勒姑父012---I'm your Uncle Chandler.
我只会搞笑啊012---Funny is all I have!
告诉你  我从明天开始到六号都在排卵012---Okay, just so you know, I'm gonna be ovulating from tomorrow until the 6th.
所以接下来的四十八小时012---So don't touch yourself
你不要自慰012---for the next 48 hours.
我不自慰的012---I don't do that.
我会试着克制自己012---I'll try to stop.
-你是说到六号吗  -是啊012---- Did you say until the 6th?  - Yeah.
今天就是六号012---Today is the 6th.
不  不是012---No, it's not.
是的  而且是2003年012---Yes, it's also 2003.
我的天  今天是六号了012---Oh, my God. Today's the 6th?
我可能已经停止排卵了012---I may be done ovulating!
我也可能在餐厅卖了有问题的肉012---I may have also served some very questionable meat at the restaurant.
-去做测试  看是不是还排  -好的012---- Go take the test, see if we're okay.  - Okay.
定力不错啊012---Tough crib.
其他的排卵测试棒呢012---Hey, where are all my ovulation sticks?
这只剩下一个了012---There's only one here.
我可能拿了几个012---I might have checked to see
测我是不是在排卵012---if I was ovulating a couple times.
钱德勒012---Chandler!
我没有工作  没事做很痛苦的012---I'm not working! There's not much to do around here!
不好意思012---Excuse me.
有没有女人在吧台那等人呢012---Is there a woman waiting at the bar?
中等身高  黑发012---Someone average height, dark hair?
可能在玩猜谜游戏012---Or perhaps doing a puzzle?
只有一个中国醉汉012---There's a drunk Chinese guy.
如果我一小时之后还在这里012---Well, if I'm still here in an hour,
给他上杯酒  算我账上012---buy him a drink on me.
您要不要再点一杯红酒012---Can I get you another glass of wine?
不知道  我不想喝到醉醺醺的  然后...012---I don't know if I should. I don't want to be drunk when I...
独自回家012---...go home alone tonight.
被放鸽子了  是吗012---Got stood up, huh?
没有什么  只不过是跟陌生人约会012---It's no big deal. It's just a blind date.
你是担心那个女的012---Are you worried your date came,
进来看你一眼就走了吗012---saw you and left?
没有012---No!
还好  我还在排卵012---We're okay. I'm still ovulating.
很好  因为今天下午四点的时候012---Oh, good, because as of 4:00 this afternoon,
我没有在排卵012---I am not.
那我们搞起来吧012---So let's do this.
-我想我没办法  -不是吧012---- I don't think I can.  - Oh, come on.
我知道你不再是十八岁了012---I know you're not 18 anymore,
给它一点时间嘛012---but give it a minute.
-因为艾玛在  -天啊  艾玛012---- Because of Emma.  - Oh, my God, Emma.
亲爱的  我忘记你在这里了012---Oh, sweetie, I forgot you were here.
说的对  我们不能这么做012---You're right, we can't do this.
也不能把她单独留在这里012---We can't leave her alone.
对不起012---Sorry.
除非…012---Unless...
或许我们可以在这里做012---maybe we do it here.
她这个年纪懂什么012---I mean, how much can she even be aware of at this age?
她已经能意识到  我们有没有离开房间012---She's aware when we leave a room.
或许她也会注意到我们…012---She may notice if we start...
在滚床单012---...canoodling in it.
滚床单012---Canoodling?
嗯  我总不能在一个娃娃面前说…012---Well, I can't say hump or screw...
做爱或是上床吧012---in front of the B-A-B-Y.
我想  在婴儿面前做爱…012---I don't know, I guess having sex in front of a baby...
-并没有那么...  -可怕  吓人012---- isn't so....  - Horrifying? Scarring?
让人蹲监狱的错012---Something people go to jail for?
-大概你说得对  -大概我说得对012---- I guess you're right.  - You guess I'm right?
那次住在宾馆的时候012---When we at that bed-and-breakfast,
你不肯和我做爱012---you wouldn't have sex with me
是因为你觉得012---because you thought
有只鹿站在窗外盯着看012---a deer was staring through the window.
什么变态混蛋012---Well, what kind of a sick bastard
会想在一只鹿面前做爱啊012---wants to do it in front of a deer?
哇  看上去都挺好吃012---Wow, everything looks so good.
我要点个鸡肉012---I think I'm gonna have the chicken.
我必须要说012---I just have to say this.
你可真美012---You're really beautiful.
嘴真甜  谢谢你012---Wow, that's very sweet. Thank you.
我长得有点可笑012---I'm kind of funny-looking.
-什么  -我是说  拜托012---- What?  - Look, I mean, come on...
你可不是我可以高攀的起的012---...you're way out of my league.
这里人人都看得出来012---Everybody in here knows it.
我敢说那边那个人  正在这么说012---I bet that guy over there is probably saying:
"她怎么会跟他约会呢"012---''Why's she out with him?"
"一定是他很有钱"012---"He must be rich.''
可是  我没钱012---Well, I'm not.
你想吃点什么012---What do you think you want to order?
我好想吃这家的鸡肉012---I'm real excited about that chicken.
我也不风趣012---I'm not funny, either.
所以如果你是在想012---So if you were thinking,
"他长得不怎么样"012---"Well, he's not that good-looking..."
"但也许他是个幽默的人"012---"but maybe we'll have some laughs,''
那你就错了012---that ain't gonna happen.
别这样  史提夫012---Well, come on, Steve,
别打断我紧张的苦笑012---let's not rule out nervous laughter.
等等  菲比告诉我012---Hey, now, wait a minute, Phoebe told me
你自己有家餐厅  很了不起啊012---that you owned your own restaurant. That's impressive.
已经没了  因为吸毒012---I lost it to drugs.
我现在卖印的T恤012---I silk-screen T-shirts now.
真的啊  工作怎么样012---Really? What's that like?
做一个你痛恨  又赚不到钱的工作012---It's really fulfilling doing something
真是非常充实啊012---you hate for no money.
没错  我没有钱  我不风趣012---That's right. I have no money, I'm not funny...
我还住在一个  只有一室的房子里012---I live in a studio apartment
还是跟两个男人合租的012---with two other guys.
我还很确定  我有不育症012---And I'm pretty sure l'm infertile.
别这样  别这样  史提夫012---Now, come on. Come on, Steve.
你肯定有对自己满意的地方012---There must be something that you like about yourself.
我倒是挺满意我的头发012---I do like my hair.
真的吗012---Really?
-哈啰  -菲比  是我012---- Hello?  - Phoebe, it's me!
我一定要追杀到你  然后把你给剁了012---I'm going to hunt you down and kill you.
嘿  瑞秋012---Hey, Rach!
这真是史上最烂的约会012---This is the worst date ever!
你怎么给我介绍这么个怪胎012---How could you set me up with this creep?
听着  你说的可是012---You know, you are talking about
我最要好  最要好的朋友012---one of my dear, dear friends.
我才不管  这人简直就是个恶梦012---I don't care. This guy is a nightmare.
好了  他只在嗑完药的时候012---All right, so he gets a little crazy
才有点失常012---when he's stoned.
他没嗑药012---He's not stoned.
他有出去抽烟吗012---Did he go out for a cigarette?
-有啊  四次  -我亲爱的甜姐儿瑞秋012---- Yeah. Four times.  - My dear, sweet Rach.
我们的计划奏效了012---Well, our plan is working.
瑞秋现在如坐针毡012---Rachel's having a miserable time...
而罗斯被人放了鸽子012---and Ross is stood up somewhere at a restaurant
正在某家餐厅里呆坐012---all alone.
他们很快就会重归于好012---Pretty soon they'll be back together.
等到大家发现我们做的好事时012---By the time anyone's figured out what we've done,
我们早就在阳光普照的墨西哥了012---we'll be in sunny Mexico.
等等  这是另一个计划的结局012---Oh, wait, that's the end of a different plan.
她睡着了  钱德勒012---She's asleep. Chandler?
你在做什么呢012---What are you doing?
艾玛也这样做啊012---Emma was doing it.
她睡着了012---She's asleep.
她睡了  那就表示我们可以…012---She's asleep. That means we can....
是的  但是我们动作必须要快012---Yes. But we have to be fast.
好的  我尽量012---Oh, okay, I'll try.
那你不能发出任何声音012---And you can't make any noise.
好啦  我尽量012---Okay, I'll try.
有人吗012---Hello?
艾玛012---Emma?
嘿  嗨012---Hey! Hi!
你好吗  你好吗012---How are you? How are you?
你的保姆们呢  嗯012---Where are your babysitters, huh?
卧房的门怎么关了012---Why is the bedroom door closed?
在照顾哇哇的时候012---You can't have S-E-X
怎么能上床啊012---when you're taking care of a B-A-B-I-E.
有个坏消息  那个中国人走了012---I've got bad news. The Chinese guy left.
命里有时终须有012---If it was meant to be,
命里无时莫强求012---it's meant to be.
被放鸽子又能怎么样012---Look, you got stood up. Who cares?
让我们来好好招待你012---We're gonna show you a good time.
你就坐着享受吧012---Sit and relax.
事实上  我要免费招待您一个012---In fact, let me bring you
蟹肉饼开胃菜吧012---a crab-cake appetizer on the house.
哇  免费的蟹肉饼吗  真是周到012---Wow, free crab cakes? Well, that's nice.
虽然我本来希望今晚可以嘿咻一下的012---Although I was hoping to have sex tonight.
只要蟹肉饼就行了012---Just the crab cakes.
你在干嘛  是要让他留下来吗012---What are you doing? Are you trying to get him to stay?
你不能这样做012---You can't do that.
不要多管闲事好吗012---Just get out of here, okay?
很抱歉  这是怎么回事012---I'm sorry, what's going on?
服务生们都在打赌012---Okay, the waiters have a little pool going.
赌你会等多久012---We have a bet on how long it'll take
才会放弃回家去012---before you give up and go home.
什么012---What?!
你竟然拿我的痛苦来赢钱012---You're making money off my misery?
只要你待到九点二十的话  我就赢了012---Well, if you stay till 9:20, I am.
太离谱了012---This is unbelievable.
我一生从未被如此羞辱过012---I have never been so insulted in my life.
现在  如果你帮我把蟹肉饼打包012---Now, if you'll wrap up my free crab cakes,
我就马上离开012---I'll be on my way.
真是奇怪012---Well, that was weird.
