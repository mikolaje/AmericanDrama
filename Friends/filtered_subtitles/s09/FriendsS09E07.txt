你那天晚上唱的歌是什么012---What was that one you sang the other night
大家都很喜欢的那首012---that everybody just loved?
《变态游行》吗012---"Pervert Parade"?
《阴毛颂》吗  停止012--- "Ode to a Pubic Hair"?  Stop.
噢  天啊  这是小牛肉吗012---Oh,God. Is that veal?
妈  我以为我跟你说过012---Mom,I thought I told you,
菲比是素食者012---Phoebe's a vegetarian.
不  没关系  没关系012---No,that's okay. That's okay.
我是说  我是素食者012---I mean,I am a vegetarian..
不过我吃小牛肉 是的  我爱吃小牛肉012---except for veal. Yeah. No. Veal I love.
菲比  你可以不用吃的012---Phoebe,you don't have to eat that.
不不不  事实上012---No, no, no, actually

好吃012---Yummy.
那012---So..
你们觉得如何呢012---what do you think?
所以你从理查的公寓偷了这卷带子012---So you stole that tape from Richard's apartment?
听听  色情片明星竟然在批评我012---Listen to the judgment from the porn star!
那带子本来就不该让012---That tape was never meant to be seen by..

你为什么要拿这卷带子呢012---Why in the world would you take this tape?
而且为什么要看呢012---And why would you watch it?
因为我就是这样的人  好吗012---Because that's who I am. Okay?
我相信像理查那样成熟的男人012---I'm sure a man like Richard
可以看这样的带子  而且不会被说教012---could see a tape like that and not be bothered.
那只不过是个黄色小插曲012---It'd just be another saucy anecdote..
让他可以在男性俱乐部里012---for him to share at his men's club
喝着白兰地  摸着胡子  和兄弟们分享012---over brandy and mustaches.
你闹来闹去  就因为你不能长胡子吗012---Is all of this about you not being able to grow a mustache?
此事是跟你和理查有关012---This is about you and Richard.
他明显没有忘记你012---He's clearly not over you.
他保留这带子012---He keeps a tape
是为了在任何想看的时候就看012---so he can look at it whenever he wants.
那不是很可悲吗012---Isn't that sad?
你看不出来这是多可悲的事吗012---Can't you see how pathetic that is?
别吃醋了  你应该为他感到可怜012---Don't be jealous. You should feel bad for him.
是啊  可怜的理查  他012---Yeah,well,poor Richard,he..
我可以长胡子的012---I can grow a mustache.

骑上去  牛仔女012---Ride 'em,cowgirl!

花钱买新的空白带子嘛  医生012---Spring for a new blank tape,doctor!

嗨  亲爱的012---Hello,dear.
怎么了012---What's going on?
我们只是随便聊聊012---We were just chitchatting.

拜托  亲爱的  老实说吧012---Please,darling,let's be honest.
你跟她也可以享受水手般的激烈性爱的012---You can have all the sailor fun you want with that one.
但是我们要面对现实  好了  停012--- But let's be real.  All right,stop.
菲比今晚所做的一切012---All Phoebe has done tonight
都是为了要让你们喜欢她012---is try and get you to like her.
或许你们没看出她的意图012---Maybe it hasn't been clear all the time

那又如何  如果我都无所谓了012---So what? If I can get past that,
你们有什么好在意的012---it shouldn't bother you.
你们没必要去喜欢她012---You don't have to like her.
只需要接受我喜欢她的事实就可以012---Just accept the fact that I do.
如果你们无法善待我爱的女人012---If you can't even be civil to the woman I love..

我爱的女人012---The woman I love.
我爱你012---I love you.
不过我第一次对你说这句话012---Just something I probably shouldn't say for the first time,
或许不该当着我父母的面012---in front of my parents..
以及汤姆跟苏的面012---and Tom and Sue.
对了  顺便说一句012---Who are,by the way,
他们是我一生中遇过的最无聊的人012---the most sinfully boring people I've ever met in my life.
