你可以发布状态012---You can post messages for people,
让大家知道你的近况012---let everyone know what you're up to.
太好了  一个更快速方式012---Oh, great. A faster way to tell people
昭告大家  我失业又没小孩012---that I'm unemployed and childless.
知道大家的近况挺有意思的012---It's actually interesting to find out what people are doing.

不肯跟你上床的那个高个子女生吗012---That tall girl that wouldn't sleep with you?
她的网络公司倒闭了012---Well, her Internet company went under,
还在游艇事故里失去一只耳朵012---and she lost an ear in a boating accident.
我敢说她现在一定会跟你上床了012---Bet she'd sleep with you now.
不行  我已经发邮件问过她了012---No, I already e-mailed her.

古生物学博士  有两个小孩012---Doctor of paleontology, two kids.
等等  你跟卡罗尔分开的原因012---Wait a second. You split with Carol
是因为兴趣不同吗012---because you had different interests?
我认为你跟她分开的原因012---I think you split with Carol
是因为某个兴趣相同012---because you had one very similar interest.
我等一下再写好了  去拿件外套012---I'm gonna finish this later, okay? Let me just grab my coat.
好的012---Okay!
怎样  你花了两分钟就能学会吗012---What, did you think you learned how to do it in the last two minutes?

我不在乎世俗的眼光012---I don't care what society says,
它给了我最棒的性生活012---it's the best sex I've ever had.
然后  发布012---And send.
不  你怎么能这么对他012---No, no-- You can't do that to him.
-好了  我们走  -老兄012---- All right, let's go.  - Dude!
我想你很清楚的证明了012---I think you made it clear you can't be trusted
不能让你在室内碰球012---with the ball inside the house.
然后  发布012---And send.
《老友记》  第九季 第17集  罗斯的"追悼会"012---Friends S09E17 The One With The Memorial Service
嘿  篮球打得怎么样012---Hey. How was basketball?
很好玩012---It was fun.
一直玩到钱德勒的眼睛被手指戳到012---Right up until Chandler got a finger in the eye.
哦  天啊  是谁弄的012---Oh, no! Who did that?
钱德勒自己012---Chandler. Yeah.
嘿012---Hey!
-瑞秋  -怎样012---- Rach?  - Yeah?
哈格吉为什么会在艾玛的婴儿车里012---What's Huggsy doing in the crib with Emma?
她到处爬的时候看到了012---She was just crawling around and found him,
所以我就让他们一起睡觉觉012---so I just let her sleep with him.
-没关系吧  -当然  没关系012---- That's all right, isn't it?  - Of course. Yeah.
只是填充玩具而已012---It's a stuffed animal, you know?
是给小孩玩的  不是给大人的012---It's for kids. Not for adults.
这点我知道012---I know that.
乔伊  你确定吗  我知道你很爱他012---Joey, you're sure? I mean, I know how much you love him.
瑞秋  我们说清楚012---Rachel, let's be clear on this, okay?
我没有很爱他012---I do not love Huggsy.
我只是以正常的程度喜欢他012---I like him a normal amount.
好吧  但是艾玛爱死他了012---All right. Well, Emma loves him.
是啊  能不爱嘛  他那么好012---Yeah. Well, why wouldn't she? He's a wonderful person!
-嗨  -嘿  菲比  你还好吗012---- Hi.  - Hey, Phoebe. How you doing?
-你感觉好点了吗  -分手真是难受012---- You feeling better?  - Breaking up sucks.
-我真的好想迈克  -真遗憾012---- Oh, I really miss Mike.  - Oh, I'm so sorry.
我已经试过所有疗伤法了012---I've tried everything to feel better.
甚至还想要写首歌012---I even tried writing a song about it...
但是我不想出任何韵律  可以配这个调的012---but I can't think of anything that rhymes with:
莫妮卡  我需要你帮我渡过这段时期012---Hey, Monica, I'm gonna need your help getting through this.
你不需要我帮忙吗012---You're saying you're not gonna need my help?
暂不  当我准备好012---No. When I get to the point where I'm ready...
要听糗死迈克笑话时012---...to hear cruel, mocking jokes about Mike,
我会来找你的012---I'm gonna come to you.
很好  因为我已经想出三个了012---Oh, good, because I've already thought of three.
四个  我刚刚又想出第四个012---Four! I just thought of a fourth!
好了  我知道我的决定是正确的012---Okay. I mean, I know I did the right thing.
迈克再也不想结婚012---Mike never wants to get married...
而我也不陷进一段没有未来的感情012---...and I shouldn't be in a relationship that has no future.
但没多久  我就会很想他012---But pretty soon, I'm gonna miss him so much...
很想再见到他012---...I'm gonna want to see him again,
到时候你一定要阻止我012---and you have to stop me.
好的  没问题012---Okay, you got it.
除非… 我是不是太小题大做了012---Unless.... Am I being too crazy about this?
好吧  就算没有未来又如何012---All right, so there's no future.
那不表示我们不会快乐啊012---But that doesn't mean we still can't have fun.
算了  就当我没说过012---You know what? Forget what I said.
真的吗012---Really?
好吧  如果你想的话012---All right, if that's what you want.
那是个测试  你没及格012---That was a test, and you just failed.
该死的  新手才会犯的错012---Damn it! Rookie mistake!
我和恐龙做爱012---I have sex with dinosaurs?
我好像有所耳闻012---I believe I read that somewhere.
不只不好笑012---Not only is it not funny,
而且从生理角度上这不可能  好吗012---it's physically impossible! Okay?
由于物种不同012---Depending on the species,
我必须要有六尺长的…012---I'd have to have a 6-foot-long--
这一点儿不好笑012---It's not funny!
对此我保留反对意见012---I respectfully disagree.
你竟然在我的校友主页上012---I can't believe you put that
写这些东西012---on my alumni page.
谁在乎呢  没人会去看的012---Who cares? Nobody reads those.
最好没有012---You better hope not...
因为我刚刚看了你主页上发布的消息012---...because I just read what you put on your page today.
我没有主页012---I don't have a page.
哦  对此我保留反对意见012---Oh, I respectfully disagree!
瞧瞧你  甜美天真的样子012---Look at you. All sweet and innocent,
睡得像天使一样012---sleeping like an angel.
被困在艾玛的肥手里012---With Emma's chubby little hands wrapped around you.
没关系  艾玛  你继续睡012---It's okay, Emma. You stay asleep.
不要靠近婴儿床  我有武器012---Step away from the crib! I have a weapon!
没关系  瑞秋  是我012---It's okay! It's okay, Rach! It's me!
快把发卷放下012---Put down the scrunchie.
你在干嘛012---What are you doing?
我听到艾玛这有声音012---Well, I heard Emma stirring...
所以我过来确定一下012---...so I came in to make sure
让她可以抓到哈格吉012---she could reach Huggsy.
谢谢  反正醒了  我要去上厕所012---Oh, thanks. All right, well, now that I'm up, I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
好的  拿去  亲爱的012---Okay, there you go, sweetie.
这事没完012---This isn't over!
等等  为什么罗斯要跟班里每个人说012---Wait a second. Why would Ross tell everyone in your class
你始终就是个同性恋012---that you are ''as gay as the day is long''?
因为我告诉大家  他跟恐龙上床012---Because I told everyone he slept with dinosaurs.
那明显就是个笑话012---Well, that's clearly a joke.
但是这有可能是真的012---This could easily be true.
你能接一下吗012---Would you get that, please?
一整天  大家不断打电话恭喜我012---People have been calling to congratulate me all day.
你好012---Hello?
不  他不在家  我是他老婆012---No, he's not here. Yeah, this is his wife.
是啊  我也被吓了好大一跳012---Yeah. Well, it came as quite a shock to me too!
嗯  我早该猜到的012---Well, I guess I should've known.
他总是逼我看《红磨坊》012---He just kept making me watch Moulin Rouge.
挂掉  挂掉012---Hang up! Hang up!
而且那是部好电影012---And that was a great movie.
我一定报复罗斯012---I'm so gonna get back at Ross.
来吧  让他尝尝我的厉害  开始啦012---Oh, yeah, this'll show him. Here we go.
你在做什么呢012---What are you doing?
你等着看好戏吧  我的朋友012---Oh, you'll see, my friend!
我死了012---I'm dead?
英年早逝012---And so young.
发布说我死了  这一点都不好笑012---Posting that I died? That really isn't funny.
死法才比较好笑012---Well, how you died was funny.
拜托  被胖子撞死012---Oh, please. Hit by a blimp?
美国每年都有一个人因此丧命012---It kills over one Americans every year.
难以置信  我同学们会以为我死了012---Unbelievable. My classmates are gonna think I'm dead.
我的教授012---My professors.
我...我的父母会接到许多电话的012---My parents are gonna get phone calls!
你在玩弄大家的感请012---You're messing with people's feelings here.
还跟我谈大家的感情012---You wanna talk about people's feelings?
你该听听  当我告诉史登教授012---You should have heard how hurt
不能跟他一起去基韦斯特度假时012---Professor Stern was when I told him
他有多受伤012---I wouldn't be able to go to Key West!
你玩过界了  但没关系012---You've really crossed a line here. But that's okay.
因为我要去买个PS软件012---Because I'm on my way to buy some Photoshop software...
和一叠的同志色情照片012---...and a stack of gay porn.
没错  你的出柜将会是图文并茂012---That's right. Your coming-out is about to get real graphic!
天啊  我真希望迈克在这里012---God, I wish Mike were here.
好了  如果迈克在这012---Okay, if Mike were here,
你们会做什么012---what would the two of you be doing?
你们是动物吗  现在才下午四点012---What are you, animals? It's 4:00 in the afternoon.
我给他打个电话012---I gotta call him.
只是说说话  没大碍的012---Just to talk to him. There's no harm in that.
开头都是这样012---That's how it starts.
我不吃蛋糕  我只是要闻一下012---''I don't need to eat the cake, I'll just smell the icing.
就吃一点点012---Why not just a little sliver?''
或是  好吧  一两块就好012---Or, ''Okay, just a slice or two.''
然后你就210磅了012---The next thing you know, you're 210 pounds...
连过个通道都会被卡住012---...and you get wedged in going down the tunnel slide!
菲比  亲爱的  我知道这很难012---Phoebe, honey, I know this is hard.
但是如果你跟他说话012---But look, if you talk to him,
你就会想见他了012---then you're gonna want to see him.
如果你见了他  你就会想跟他复合了012---And if you see him, you're gonna wanna get back together.
我知道  这不是你想要的012---And I know that's not what you want.
好了  把电话给我012---All right, so give me your phone.
给012---Here.
-还有你的手机  -好吧012---- And now your cell.  - Okay.
拿去012---There you go.
-这是你的手机  -是啊012---- This is your cell phone?  - Yes.
这是你现在用的手机012---This is your current cell phone?
是的  它让我想起简单的往日012---Yes. It reminds me of a simpler time.
菲比  你的包呢012---Phoebe? Where's your purse?
-嘿  不行  -不012---- Hey! No!  - No!
-给我  -不给你012---- Give it to me!  - You can't have it!
-给我  -不要012---- Give it to me!  - No!
-我会伸进去拿的  -哦  是哦012---- I'll go in there!  - Oh, yeah.
-菲比  过来  -不012---- Phoebe, come here!  - No!
-给我  -你疯了012---- Give it to me!  - You're crazy!
去你的  莫妮卡·盖勒  宾氏012---Damn you, Monica Geller hyphen Bing!
瞧瞧是谁来了012---Hey, look who's here.
是乔伊带回来一个新朋友012---It's Joey. And he brought home a friend.
乔伊  艾玛在这呢012---Joey! Emma's right here.
你答应过白天不带女生回来012---You promised not to bring girls home in the middle of the day!
不  不是女生  是…012---No, no, no, it's not a girl. It's...
全新的哈格吉012---...a brand-new Huggsy!
太棒了  现在艾玛有两个哈格吉了012---Oh! Oh, that's so great! Now Emma has two Huggsies!
不  艾玛有一个哈格吉012---No, no. Oh, no. No, Emma has one Huggsy.
新的哈格吉012---The new Huggsy.
另外那个哈格吉012---The other Huggsy,
我不知道  还是我把他拿回去好了012---I don't know, I guess I'll just take him back.
你知道吗  小时候012---You know what? When I was a little girl,
我有一只粉红色的小马叫棉花糖012---I had a little pink pony named Cotton.
我非常喜欢她012---Oh, I loved her so much.
去哪我都带着012---I took her everywhere.
给她的尾巴编辫子012---I would braid her tail--
赶紧换过来012---Make the transfer!
旧哈格吉身上有个钮扣不见了012---Should I be concerned that a button
我找不到012---fell off the old Huggsy
不会出事吧012---and I can't find it?
不  不用担心  几年前我吞下去012---No, don't worry about it. I swallowed that years ago. Hey!
怎么了  我想她不喜欢新哈格吉012---Oh, what? I don't think she likes the new Huggsy.
但他们是一样的啊012---But he's the same.
我想她要旧的哈格吉012---I think she wants the old one back.
是哦  但他们一模一样啊012---Yeah, but he's the same.
乔伊  拿来012---Joey, come on.
根本是一样的嘛012---But he's the same!
你才不像他012---You're not the same.
你这样吓不到我012---You know, it's a lot less surprising to do that
别忘了是我放你上楼的012---after I've buzzed you into the building.
菲比  为什么门口有男人的鞋子呢012---So, Phoebe, why are there men's shoes by the door?
那是我的鞋子012---Those are my shoes.
看来你复元之后  我该带你购物了012---Well, when you get over this breakup, we need to go shopping.
听着  莫妮卡012---Look, Monica,
我真的很感激你这样关心我012---I really appreciate you checking in on me.
-我已经觉得好多了  -真的012---- But I'm actually feeling a lot better.  - You are?
是  现在我想一个人待会儿012---Yeah, I just kind of want to be alone right now.
-是谁  -我叫了中餐外卖012---- Who's that?  - I ordered Chinese food.
真是太巧了012---What are the chances?!
十亿中国人民把迈克派来了012---One billion Chinese people, and they send Mike!
你来这里做什么呢012---What are you doing here?
菲比打电话给我012---Phoebe called me.
-菲比  -抱歉  我忍不住了012---- Phoebe!  - I'm sorry. I broke down.
我想要见他012---I wanted to see him.
该死的  菲比012---Damn it, Phoebe,
你是怎么给他打的电话012---how did you even call him?
电话主机有免提012---There's a speakerphone on the base unit.
主机  用脑啊  莫妮卡  用用脑012---Base unit. Think, Monica, think!
听着  如果我想见菲比  而她…012---Look, if I want to see Phoebe, and she--
没你的事儿012---This doesn't concern you!
抱歉  我只是听到有人提到我的名字012---Sorry. I guess I was thrown off by the mention of my name.
听着  你们不能这样做012---Look, guys, you can't do this.
不然分手就更难了012---It's gonna make getting over each other harder.
如果我们什么都不做012---Not if nothing happens.
像朋友一样相处不行吗012---Why can't we just hang out as friends?
当然可以  如果你们只是朋友012---Sure. If you're just gonna hang out as friends,
那我也可以加入012---then maybe I'll join you.
我是你的朋友  也是迈克的朋友012---You know, I'm your friend and Mike's friend.
坐下吧012---Sit down.
给朋友让个位置012---Make room for your friend.
你过得好不好012---So how have you been?
我还挺不错的012---I've been pretty good.
你真的很美012---You look really beautiful.
谢谢  你看起来也不错012---Thanks. You look good too.
不对  这太危险了  说话注意点012---No, no, no. This is dangerous territory. Keep it clean.
钢琴弹得怎么样了012---So how's the piano playing going?
我最近弹了许多情歌012---Actually, I've been playing a lot of love songs lately.
-我好想你  -我也想你012---- I've missed you.  - I've missed you too.
来这的路上012---You know, on the way over here,
我看到一个酒鬼吐了一地012---I saw this drunk guy throw up.
然后一只鸽子还去吃012---And then a pigeon ate it.
嘿  罗斯012---Hey. Ross.
听着  我想跟你道歉012---Look, I just wanted to apologize.
别告诉我  你真的在做我的同志照012---Don't tell me you actually made those gay pictures of me.
瞧瞧这个012---Check this out.
原来如果我有健身  就是这样的啊012---So that's what I'd look like if I worked out.
而且还是警察先生为我服务012---And was being serviced by a policeman.
你不会真的发出去吧012---You're not gonna actually send these out, are you?
不会了  因为你"罗斯死了" 的笑话012---Actually, I don't need to, because your little ''Ross is dead'' joke
根本没效果012---didn't work.
好吗  根本就没有人回应012---Okay? There were no responses.
网上没人发布任何东西012---Nobody posted anything on the website,
没人打电话给我父母012---nobody called my parents,
该笑话你才对012---so the joke is on you.
没人打电话  没人写信012---Nobody called, nobody wrote anything,
没人在乎我死了012---nobody cares that I'm dead.
哦  我的天啊012---Oh, my God.
没有人在乎我死了吗012---Nobody cares that I'm dead?
哦  别这样  你知道不是那样的012---Oh, come on, you know that's not true.
说什么  你不过发布个出柜的消息012---What are you talking about? You get 60 responses...
就有六十个回复012---just for coming out of the closet.
我连一个回复都没有  我可是死了012---I didn't get one response, and I'm dead!
嗯  同志社团比死人社团话多012---Well, the gay community is a lot more vocal than the dead community.
不敢相信  连我地质学搭档都没有回复012---I can't believe this. Not even my geology lab partner.
以前都是我罩他的012---And I carried that guy!
我们重新想一下  好吧012---Look, let's think about this, okay?
大家在这悲伤的时刻012---You think people are gonna disturb your family
忍心打扰你的家人吗012---at this tragic time?
有人会在网站上张贴哀悼辞吗012---That people are gonna post condolences on a website?
不是说大家不在乎012---This isn't about people not caring.
而是没有合适的渠道悼念012---This is about people not having a decent outlet for their grief.
-说的对  的确没有合适的渠道  -没错012---- You're right. There isn't a decent outlet.  - Right.
你要是办追悼会   我肯定很多人会来的012---I'm sure if you had a funeral or memorial service, tons of people would come.
就是这样012---Exactly!
罗斯  你要干嘛012---Ross, what are you doing?
你要帮自己办追悼会012---You're having a memorial service for yourself?
不  那得多傻  是你帮我办的012---No, that would be stupid. You're having it for me.
罗斯  不要发出去  不要发…012---Ross, don't press send. Don't press--
不  太迟了  已经发了012---No, too late. Too late. It's sent.
对不起  还有你跟警察先生的照片012---Sorry, so is that picture of you and the policeman.
我刚要哄艾玛睡一下012---I'm trying to put Emma down for a nap.
你有看到哈格吉吗012---Have you seen Huggsy?
原版的还是不好的那个012---Original or crappy?
-原版的  -没有  抱歉  没有看到012---- Original.  - No. Sorry. Haven't seen him.
那你床单下面那个鼓包是什么012---Then what's that big lump under your covers?
是莫妮卡  行了吗012---It's Monica, okay?
那才不是莫妮卡012---That's not Monica!
好啦  没关系  是原版的哈格吉012---All right, fine! It's original Huggsy!
我知道艾玛要他012---I know Emma wants him,
但他是我的  而我需要他012---but he's mine and I need him.
她真不讲理012---She's being unreasonable.
乔伊  艾玛爱那个蠢企鹅是有原因的012---Joey, there is a reason that Emma loves that stupid penguin so much!
别捂他耳朵012---Oh, don't cover its ears!
因为这会让她想起乔伊叔叔012---It's because it reminds her of her Uncle Joey.
-真的  -当然012---- It does?  - Yeah.
她喜欢抱着他012---And she's comforted by him
是因为她是非常爱乔伊叔叔012---because she loves her Uncle Joey so much.
-真的  她爱我  -当然啦012---- Really? She loves me?  - Oh, yeah.
但是你知道吗012---But you know what?
如果你需要哈格吉  没关系012---If you need Huggsy, don't worry.

看来你做得还真差012---Well, you're not doing a very good job.
-你说什么  -这个吻怎么回事012---- Excuse me?  - What's with the kissing?

是啊  感谢上帝012---Yeah, thank God
有你在这里监看他们亲吻012---you were here to oversee all the kissing.
你没有听到他说的话012---You didn't hear the speech.

你只给他们一天的时间012---You gave them one day's notice.
又不是每个人天天都上网012---Not everyone checks the website every day.
而有莫妮卡  或许因为你的站像012---And Monica, it's probably the way you stand!

我在学校上了四年012---I went to that school for four years

你这变态  谁会做这种事012---You sick freak! Who does that?
