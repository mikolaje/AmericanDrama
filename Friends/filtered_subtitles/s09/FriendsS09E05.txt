噢  嘿  你们大家012---Oh,hey,you guys?
我生日当天晚上订不到餐厅012---I couldn't get a reservation for the night of my birthday..
所以我们要改到星期四晚上012---so we'll have to do dinner Thursday night instead.
星期四  但那是万圣节耶012---Thursday? But that's Halloween.
那又怎样012---So?
只不过是很诡异而已012---It's just spooky,that's all.
那  麦克也会跟我们吃晚餐吗012---So,is Mike coming to dinner?
不会  我第一次可以跟男朋友过生日012---No. It's my first birthday with a boyfriend,
他却要上班012---and he has to work.
我很想对他发脾气012---I'd get mad at him,
但是我想这会太快露出我的本性012---but I think it's too soon to show my true colors.
菲比  你只预定5个人的餐位就可以了012---Oh phobs, I would make the reservation for five.
我们其中一个要留下来照顾艾玛012---Because one of us has to stay with Emma.
我们俩应该谁去呢  瑞秋012--- Which one of us should go to dinner?  Rachel!
事实上  我想或许我们两个都可以去012---Actually,I was thinking maybe both of us could go.
哦  真好012---Oh, yeah
谢谢  我会多用点心准备你的礼物012---Thanks. I'll put a lot of extra thought into your gift.
好了  太棒了  我们全部都可以去012---All right,so great,we can all go now.
真棒  你们知道吗012---That is fun! Hey! You know what?
我们六个人已经很久没有这样在一起了012---We all haven't been together,the six of us,in such a long time.
你在说什么呢012---What are you talking about?
我们现在就在一起啊012---We're together now.
莫妮  钱德勒并不在这里012---Mon? Chandler's not here.
噢  老天012---Oh,dear God.

现在  在我们开始之前012---Now,before we get started,
有什么问题要问吗012---are there any questions?
很好  肯  对吧  没错012--- Yes. Ken,is it?  That's right.
有传闻说你之所以会来塔尔萨012---Is it true the reason you're in Tulsa is,
是因为你在开会的时候睡着012---you fell asleep in a meeting..
然后随口接下此份工作012---and took the job
其实你根本搞不清是来干什么的  对吧012---without realizing what you were saying yes to?
别道听途说  肯012---Well,don't believe everything you hear,Ken.
但是没错  那是真的012---But yeah,that's true.
好了  我们先开始012---All right,let's get started
看一下上一季的数字012---by taking a look at last quarter's figures.
克劳蒂亚  你该先012---Claudia,aren't you supposed
问一下老板可不可以抽烟吧012---to blow smoke up the boss's ass?
我很抱歉  你介意我抽烟吗012---I'm sorry. Does the smoke bother you?
不  我抽了好多年  然后戒了012---No. I smoked for years. Then I quit.
现在也忘了为什么要戒012---Right now,I can't remember why.
在办公室不准抽烟的  不是吗012---You're not allowed to smoke in this office,right?
可以的  在奥克拉荷马012---Yes,in Oklahoma

如果你们其他人也想抽012---But if the rest of you want to light up,
请便  没关系的012---go ahead,it's fine.
原来你们全部都抽烟012---So,you all smoke,then?
其实  我不抽烟反而看起来很没礼貌012---You know,it's almost rude that I'm not smoking.
没那回事  如果你不想012---That's not true. If you don't want..
肯  拜托012---Ken,please!
不  不行  我不能抽烟012---No,I can't. I can't smoke.
如果我抽烟  我老婆会杀了我012---If I smoke,my wife would kill me.
不好意思  但你老婆不是在纽约吗012---I'm sorry,but isn't your wife back in New York?
我一直都很喜欢你  肯012---I've always liked you,Ken.
不给糖就捣蛋012---Trick or treat.
嘿  真是大饱眼福呀012--- Hey.  And "treat" it is.
哇  幸好我有换衣服012---Wow. So glad I changed.
我差一点就穿上那件012---I almost wore my threadbare robe
连胸部都遮不住的破睡袍012---that can't contain my breasts.
我不是要穿这件出门  我正在排卵012---This is not what I'm wearing. I'm ovulating..
而钱德勒很快就回来了012---and Chandler's gonna be home.
所以我觉得可以在晚餐前尝试受孕012---So,I thought we would try before dinner.
等一下  这表示你们会迟到吗012---Wait,does this mean you'll be late?
相信我  钱德勒和我012---Believe me, Chandler and I
已经超过一个星期没有见面了012---haven't seen each other in over a week.
我们可能会是第一个到的012---We'll probably be the first ones there.
好了  待会见  祝你们搞的愉快012---Okay. See you there. Happy humping.

那个小孩穿过他爷爷那个广告012---Where the little kid walks through Grandpa?
真是吓死人了012---It's chilling!
我搞砸了012---I messed up.
当时正开会  每个人都在抽烟012---It was a meeting. Everybody was smoking.
那又如何  你难道没有任何意志力吗012---So what? Don't you have any willpower?
意志力012---Willpower?
我看过你吃巧克力的家庭录影带012---I've watched home movies of you eating Ding Dongs..
连包装纸都来不及打开012---without taking the tinfoil off!
你说那看起来很性感012---You said that was sexy!
好了  好了  可不可以算了012---Okay,look,can we just drop this?

钱德勒  别开玩笑  好吗012---Chandler,don't joke with me. Okay?
我现在非常非常地不高兴012---I'm very,very upset right now.
现在是你最不高兴的时候吗012---Is this the most upset you could be?
我想应该是的012---I think so.
那  我何不就012---Well,then I might as well..
这样做012---do this.
不确定接下来要干什么012---Not really sure what to do now.
我告诉你我们接下来要做什么012---I'll tell you what we're gonna do.
我们已经迟了012---We're already late
赶不上菲比的生日晚餐了012---for Phoebe's birthday dinner.
所以你要把香烟熄掉012---So you're going to put out that cigarette..
我们先暂停吵架  先上床再说012---we're gonna put this fight on hold,and go have sex.
好  什么012---Fine. What?
上床  今天是我排卵的最后一天012---Sex! This is the last day I'm ovulating.

噢  是的012---Oh,yeah!
随便  做就做  但我不跟你说话012---All right,fine,I'll do it,but no talking!
而且没有抱抱  而且不亲吻你脖子012--- And no cuddling.  And no kissing your neck.

我等不了那么久012---I can't wait that long.
你得想想办法  把门撞倒吧012---You have to do something. Knock that door down!
我也想  但是我就跟桃子一样容易撞伤012---I would,but I bruise like a peach.
而且  你知道  一切都会没事的012---Besides,you know,everything's gonna be fine.
宝宝在睡觉012---The baby's sleeping.
万一她跳出摇篮呢012---What if she jumps out of the bassinet?
根本连头都抬不起来  还想跳012---Can't hold her head up,but jumped.
噢  天啊  我水龙头还开着012---Oh,my God! I left the water running!
瑞秋  你没有让水龙头开着012---Rach, you did not leave the water running.
拜托  冷静一点  好吗012---Please,pull yourself together,okay?
那  我有把炉子开着吗012---Well,did I leave the stove on?
1996年之后你就没有煮过饭了012---You haven't cooked since 1996.
窗户有开着吗  如果开着012---Is the window open? If the window's open
鸟可能会飞进来然后012---a bird could fly in and..
天啊  你知道吗  我想你说对了012---My God,you know what? I think you're right.
我觉得  其实  听  听012---I think, you know what, listen, listen
是鸽子  不  等等  不012---A pigeon. No. No,wait,no.
是老鹰飞进去了012---An eagle flew in!
飞到炉子上然后着火了012---Landed on the stove and caught fire!
宝宝看到这一切012---The baby,seeing this,
从公寓这边跳过去帮助老鹰012---jumps across the apartment to the mighty bird's aid.
而老鹰却误认为那是个攻击的行动012---The eagle,however,misconstrues this as an act of aggression..
用爪子捉住婴儿012---and grabs the baby in its talon.
就在这时候  水龙头的水012---Meanwhile,the faucet
充满了整间公寓012---fills the apartment with water.
宝宝跟老鹰正熊熊燃烧012---Baby and bird,still ablaze,
双方被死亡的陷阱困住012---are locked in a death grip..
在公寓内的漩涡里旋转着012---swirling around the whirlpool that fills the apartment!
天  如果这一切是真的你就死定了012---Boy,are you gonna be sorry if that's true.
你们好 嗨012--- Hello.  Hi.

领班要我问你们012---The maitre d' asked
是否要考虑换到小桌子012---if you'd reconsider switching to a smaller table.
或许我们应该先用餐012---Maybe we should just eat now.
在人还没有到齐之前你们不能点餐012---You can't order until the entire party's arrived.
餐厅规定012---Restaurant policy.
好  那如果说另一桌离开了012---Well,how about this? Another table leaves,right..
但是他们的餐盘里还有食物012---but there's still some food left on their plates.
那么  餐厅有规定012---Okay,what's the restaurant's policy
不能吃那些食物吗012---about people eating that?
那很恶心  但还是会发生啊012--- It's frowned upon.  But it happens.

听着  我做不到012---Look,I can't do this.
我现在没办法跟你做爱012---I can't make love to you
我们正吵架呢012---while we're fighting this way.
噢  是啊  现在你可真敏感012---Oh,sure. Now you're Mr. Sensitivity.
那当初你想在我叔叔丧礼之后做爱时012---But when you wanted to have sex after my uncle's funeral..
那是庆祝生命012---That was a celebration of life!
好了  我不想这样做  听到了吗012---All right,I'm not gonna do this. all right?
你真希望我们的孩子在这种情况下受孕吗012---Is this the way you want our baby to be conceived?
不  你是对的012---No,you're right.
我们不应该在这种情况下做012---We shouldn't do it like this.
反正  我很抱歉012---For what it's worth,I'm sorry.
我不应该对你抽烟这件事如此刁难012---I shouldn't have come down on you so hard about the smoking.
你是抽了几根烟012---So you had a few cigarettes.
又不代表世界末日012---It's not the end of the world.
真的吗  是的012--- Really?  Yeah.
你真不可思议012---You are incredible.
听着  我不会再抽烟了012---And listen,I'm not gonna smoke again.
如果我抽  我保证也会012---And if I do,I promise I will
隐藏到让你看不出来012---hide it so much better from you.
想吗  我们来庆祝生命012--- Want to?  Let's celebrate life!

我再也不会离开她了012---I'm never leaving her again.
我了解  分离是很煎熬的012---I understand. Separation is hard.
有一次我要离开罗斯去美容院012---One time I was about to leave Ross to go to the beauty parlor.
他就变得很不开心  他把衣服脱光012---And he got so upset he took off all his clothes..

然后哭喊012---and cried out,
"妈咪  我是女生 带我跟你去"012---"Mommy,I'm a girl. Take me with you."
然而  时光飞逝012---Somehow,over time,
现在跟你分开已经变得容易很多了012---it got easier to be apart from you.
不客气012---You are welcome.
老实说  我们还是不要说话012---You know what? Let's not talk.
什么012---What?
我对你抽烟的事还是很生气012---I am still so mad at you for smoking!
但你说你已经原谅我了012---But you said you forgave me.
只不过是几根烟  没什么大不了的012---It was just a couple of cigarettes,no big deal.
我那样说是因为我正在排卵012---I just said that because I was ovulating
而你却说012---and you said
如果我们在吵架  你是不会跟我做爱的012---you wouldn't have sex if we were fighting.
你骗我跟你上床012---You tricked me to get me into bed?
没错  我得到我想要的了012---That's right. I got mine.
我觉得被利用了012---I feel so used.
