乔伊012---Joey?
我的天啊012---Oh,my God.
好吧012---Okay.
那么012---So..
我想  我们该正式一点  对吧012---I guess we should make it official,huh?
听着  瑞秋  我012---Look,Rach,I..
嘿  罗斯来了012---Hey,Ross is here!
嘿  瞧我的好朋友罗斯来了012---Hey,look,it's my good friend Ross!
嘿  罗斯  嘿  乔伊012--- Hey,Ross.  Hey,Joey.
嘿  你好 嘿  你好012--- Hey,you.  Hey,you.
他还送花呢012---And he brought flowers!
谢了  罗斯012---Thanks,Ross.
我倒是那种喜欢送糖果的人012---I'm really more of a candy kind of guy.
你今天真诡异012---You're weird today.
听着  我有事想跟你谈012---Listen,I wanted to talk to you about something.
事实上  我也需要跟你谈谈012---Yeah. Actually,I kind of need to talk to you too.
乔伊  你可以回避一下吗 不行012--- Joey,could you give us a minute?  No.
什么  我很抱歉  我是说做不到012--- What?  I'm sorry. I meant,"No."
嘿  瞧瞧谁来了012---Hi. Hey,look who's here.
我的孙女在哪012---Where's my granddaughter?
我一直在练习变魔术012---I've been practicing my magic tricks.
他从我耳后变出一个硬币012---He pulled a quarter out of my ear.
嘿  妈呢  她去接莉蒂阿姨012--- Hey,where's Mom?  She went to pick up Aunt Liddy.
莉蒂阿姨要来012---Aunt Liddy's coming?
那我们又可以得到5块零花钱啦012---That means we get $5 each!
我何时才可以见到艾玛012---So when do I get to meet Emma
然后表演这个给她看012---and show her this:
好耶  哇012---Okay,wow.
艾玛在育婴室012---Emma's in the nursery.
如果你要看她  我现在就带你去012---I'll take you now if you want.
但是我真的想要跟你谈谈012---But I really want to talk to you.
我知道  我也要跟你谈谈012---I know. I still need to talk to you.
但是在你们谈之前  我需要跟你谈谈012---But before you guys do that,I need to talk to you.
还有罗斯  我也要跟你谈谈012---And Ross,I need to talk to you.
那我需要跟你谈谈 谈什么012--- And I need to talk to you.  About what?
看你知不知道他们是要谈什么012---To see if you know what these guys are talking about.
《老友记》  第九季 第1集   无人求婚012---Friends S09E01 The One Where No One Proposes
她真是漂亮012---Isn't she beautiful?
瞧瞧她  我第一个孙子012---Look at her,my first grandchild.
那本算什么012---What about Ben?
本  当然也是012---Well,of course,Ben.
我指的是我的第一个孙女012---I meant my first granddaughter.
你有想过跟瑞秋之间的可能性吗012---Have you thought any more about you and Rachel?
当然012---Yeah
事实上我刚才正准备跟她谈012---actually I was gonna talk to her
结果你们都涌进来了012---when you guys came in the room.
真是太好了012---That's so exciting!
即使我们在  你也可以开口啊012---You could've done that with us there.
是啊  没错  当然  是啊012--- Yeah,right.  Sure. Okay.
你能在我们面前自摸012---You can touch yourself in front of us,
却不能在我们面前跟瑞秋谈  什么012--- but you can't talk to Rachel. What?
我何时在你们面前自摸过012---When have I ever touched myself in front of you guys?
拜托  之前你在客厅睡着时012---Oh,please. Just before,when you were asleep in the lounge.
那些亚美尼亚人都不看电视  反而在看你012---That Armenian family was watching you instead of the TV.
这倒提醒了我012---That reminds me.
我的游戏机还在贺斯梅先生那里012---That Mr. Hazmegian still has my Game Boy.
钱德勒  我可以跟你谈一下吗  当然012--- Chandler,can I talk to you for a second?  Sure.
兄弟  我刚做了一件很恶劣的事012---Dude,I just did something terrible.
是你放的屁吗  我以为是杰克012---That was you? I thought it was Jack.
不  那确实是杰克放的012---No,no. That was Jack.
瑞秋以为我向她求婚012---Rachel thinks I asked her to marry me.
什么  她为什么会那样以为呢012---What? Why does she think that?
因为当时看着确实像那么回事儿012---Because it kind of looked like I did.
再问一次  什么012---Again,what?
好啦  我当时单膝跪在地上012---Okay,I was down on one knee
手中拿着戒指...012---with the ring in my hand..
是个男人都会偶尔那样练习一下的012---As we all are at some point during the day.
那不是我的戒指  是从罗斯的夹克掉出来的012---It wasn't my ring. It fell out of Ross' jacket..
当我蹲下去要把它捡起来时012---and when I knelt down to pick it up,
瑞秋以为我是在求婚012---Rachel thought I was proposing.
罗斯准备了戒指  他要求婚吗012---Ross had a ring? And he was gonna propose?
我想是吧  而你抢在他之前先做了012--- I guess.  And you did it first?
他会痛不欲生的012---This is gonna kill him.
你知道他有多爱向人求婚012---You know how much he loves to propose.
我知道  我知道  真是太糟糕了012---I know. I know. It's awful.
那她说了些什么012---Well,what did she say?
她说"我愿意"012---She said,"Yes."
罗斯知道吗012---Does Ross know?
我的天啊 我该怎么告诉他呢012---Oh,my God. What the hell am I gonna tell him?
或许你根本什么都不用告诉他012---Maybe you don't have to tell him anything.
我喜欢  甚合我意012---I like that. Yeah.
如果你先去跟瑞秋解释清楚012---If you clear things up with Rachel,
罗斯就永远不需要知道了012---Ross never needs to find out.
但你必须赶快行动012---But you have to do it now
别等他发现  然后痛扁你012---before he hears about it and kicks your ass.
好吧  我们别扯得太远012---All right,let's not get carried away.
我想要个小孩012---I want a baby.
亲爱的  我们已经讨论过了012---Honey,we've been over this.
我必须要先转过来才行012---I need to be facing the other way.
来嘛  来嘛  如果我们再做爱012---Come on, come on, If we have sex again,
那我怀孕的机率就会增加一倍012---it'll double our chances of getting pregnant.
更衣室现在似乎仍是空的  我好累012--- I think that closet's still available.  I am so tired.
好啦  但是说好没有前戏哦  没问题012--- Yeah,okay,but no foreplay.  Deal!
爸  你又放屁012---Dad,seriously!
你应该要找医生检查看看了012---You know,you really should see someone about that.
知道了012---Noted.
我要去找瑞秋谈谈012---I wanna go talk to Rachel for a minute.
你自己一个人在这里没问题吧012---Are you gonna be okay alone for a bit?
你在开玩笑吗012---Are you kidding me?
我可以目不转睛地看着她到永远012---I could stay and look at her forever.
事实上012---Actually..
你还好吗012---Are you all right?
我想我刚订婚了 天啊  他真求婚了吗012--- I think I just got engaged.  Oh,my God! He did it?
什么  你知道他要求婚吗012---What? Did you know he was gonna ask me?
开什么玩笑  就是我说服他去做的012---Are you kidding? I'm,like,the one who talked him into it.
我喜欢自诩为老友团里的玩偶操纵大师012---I like to think of myself as the puppet master of the group.
你真认为这是个好主意吗012---And you really think this is a good idea?
我才刚说服了他012---I just talked him into it.
别连你也要我说服才行012---Don't tell me I have to do you too?
操纵师也会累的  拜托  好吧012--- The puppet master gets tired,people.  Okay.
我不知道  总觉得怪怪的012---I don't know. It just doesn't feel right.
为什么  你们简直是天生一对012---Why? You two are so meant to be together.
大家都这么认为012---Everybody thinks so.
真的吗  即使罗斯也那样认为吗012---Really? Even Ross?
特别是罗斯012---Especially Ross.
嘿  菲比 我等一下再来012---Hey,Phoebe. You know what? I'll come back later.
小病房真是拥挤呢012---Kind of a full house here.
我想  我  等一下再来012---I guess I'll just.. I'll come back.
他走了  你的未婚夫012---There he goes. Your fiance.
我想是吧012---I guess so.
不过他会在睡着的时候自摸012---Although he does play with himself in his sleep.
我一点也不惊讶012---I can't say I'm surprised.
爸  你在做什么012---Dad,what are you doing?
有两个人在里面做爱012---There are people in there having sex.
不可能是我  我人站在这里012---It can't be me. I'm standing right here.
想要偷看吗  不要012--- Wanna peek?  No!
别这样012---Come on.
你知道吗  我讨厌妈不在你身边的时候012---You know what? I don't like you without Mom.
走吧012---Come on.
我们不偷看吗012---We're not peeking?
我还是要偷看012---Well,I'm peeking.
我的天啊012---Oh,my God!
你好先生  你认识莫妮卡的012---Hello,sir. You know Monica.
嘿  可以进来吗  当然可以012--- Hey,is it okay to come in?  Of course.
乔伊  瞧这戒指  我...012---Joey,this ring, I..
真是太美了  我好喜欢012---It's beautiful. I love it.
是啊  听着  瑞秋012---Yeah. Look, Rach,
有件事我必须要告诉你012---there's something I gotta tell you.
你准备好要再试喂母乳了吗012---Are you ready to try nursing again?
是啊  嗨  艾玛012---Yeah. Hi,Emma.
你觉得她为什么不吸我的奶呢012---Why do you think she won't take my breast?
没关系的  婴儿需要一点时间适应012---It's all right. It takes babies a while to get it.
不过别担心  她会吸的  好吧012--- But don't worry,it'll happen.  Okay.
来吧  亲爱的  你可以办得到的012---Okay,sweetie,you can do it.
张开嘴巴  然后把它放到嘴里012---Just open up and put it in your mouth.
救命啊  上帝012---Dear Lord.
我很抱歉  亲爱的  你刚想说什么012---I'm sorry,honey,what were you saying?
噢  对  听着  我想...012---Yeah,look,I think that..
瞧  她又转开了012---Look! She's pulling away again.
会不会是我的乳头对她而言太大了呢012---Do you think my nipples are too big for her mouth?
她像是被吓到了012---She looks scared.
她看起来是不是像被吓到了呢012---Doesn't she look scared?
你知道的  我跟她又不是很熟012---You know,I don't really know her.
我们试试看按摩胸部来刺激乳汁分泌012---Why don't we try massaging the breast to stimulate the flow?
好的  你在玩我吗012--- Okay.  Are you kidding me?
真是好沮丧012---This is so frustrating.
她为什么不喜欢我的乳房呢012---Why doesn't she want my breast?
我不知道  或许她发疯了012---I don't know! Maybe she's crazy!
嘿  等一下 嗨012--- Hey,wait up.  Hi.
恭喜了012---Congratulations.
我不想在乔伊面前说出来012---I didn't want to say anything in front of Joey.
因为我不清楚他是否已经知道012---I didn't know if he knew.
知道什么  我们有了个孩子吗012---What? That we had a baby?
我们别太低估他的消息灵通度了012---Now let's give him a little credit.
虽然他之前才吃了一个塑料水果012---Although he did eat a piece of plastic fruit earlier.
不  我是说你跟瑞秋订婚的事012---No,no,that you and Rachel are engaged.
什么  噢  那是秘密吗012--- What?  Oh,it's a secret?
太棒了  我们很久都没有玩秘密游戏了012---Goody. Yes! We haven't done the secret thing in a long time.
菲比  没有什么秘密  好吗012---Phoebe,there is no secret,okay?
我都没有求婚012---I didn't propose.
你在说谎吗012---Are you lying?
是不是又跟上次一样012---Is this like that time
你要骗我们你是医生（博士）012---you tried to convince us you were a doctor?
我的确是博士012---I am a doctor!
算了  我要自己去跟瑞秋谈012---You know what? I'm just gonna go and talk to Rachel myself.
好吧  我也去012---All right. Well,me too.
要不要叫醒她012---Well,should we wake her up?
不  别这样  让她睡012---No. No. Come on,let her sleep.
她真的是累坏了  而且真的是订婚了012--- She's so exhausted.  And so engaged.
我的天  她以为我们订婚了012---Oh,my God. She thinks we're engaged!
为什么  她为什么认为我们订婚了呢012---Why? Why,why would she think we're engaged?
或许是因为你给了她订婚戒指吗012---Perhaps because you gave her an engagement ring?
话说  罗斯  博士应该要是很聪明的012---You know,Ross,doctors are supposed to be smart.
我没有给她那个戒指  你没有吗012--- I didn't give her that ring.  You didn't?
没有   那是谁的戒指呢012--- No!  So whose ring is it?
是我的012---It's mine.
那是订婚戒指吗  是啊012--- Is it an engagement ring?  Yes.
但是你并没有拿给她  没有012--- But you didn't give it to her?  No.
但你本来是要求婚的  不是012--- But you were going to propose?  No!
我可能对这件事没兴趣了012---I might be losing interest in this.
听着  我妈给我那个戒指...012---Look. Look,my mom gave me that ring..
是因为她要我跟瑞秋求婚012---because she wanted me to propose to Rachel.
但是我只想要知道...012---But all I wanted to do was see..
她是否愿意再重新开始012---if she maybe,kind of wanted to start things up again.
不温不火的恋爱感觉真美好012---What beautiful lukewarm sentiment.
听着  我不想要冲动行事012---Look. I didn't want to rush into anything.
似乎她也不想要那样012---It seemed like she didn't want to either.
但我不明白怎么会变成现在的状况012---But I don't understand how any of this happened.
难道是她在我的夹克里找到戒指012---What,did she find the ring in my jacket,
然后就认为我要求婚012---assume I was gonna propose..
便急着戴上戒指  向大家宣布吗012---throw it on and just start telling people?
不  她说你有向她求婚012---No,no. She said you actually proposed to her.
我没有  我没有求婚012---Well,I didn't! I didn't propose!
除非...012---Unless..
我有吗012---Did I?
我已经40个小时没睡觉...012---I haven't slept in 40 hours and..
那听起来的确像是我会做的事012---It does sound like something I would do.
听着  我们不能永远躲在这里012---Look,we can't stay in here forever.
我只是不敢相信我爸看到我们在做爱012---It's just,I still can't believe that my dad saw us having sex.
我的钢琴独奏会他都一次没去过012---He didn't make it to one of my piano recitals,
但他却看到这个012---but this he sees!
没关系的  我们都是大人了012---This is okay. We're all adults here.
没有什么好丢人的012---There's nothing to be ashamed of.
现在  我们把内裤放到口袋里012---Now,let's put our underwear in our pockets
然后大胆走出去012---and walk out the door.
嗨  爸012---Hi,Dad.
我还是可以叫你爸  对吧012---I can still call you that,right?
当然  我永远都是你爸012---Of course. I'll always be your dad.
我只想让你知道012---I just want you to know that
你刚刚目击的行为  并非是为了爽而已012---what you witnessed in there,that wasn't for fun.
不爽吗  为什么  为什么你...012--- It wasn't fun?  Why,why,why would you..?
我只是不想让你认为012---Look,I just don't want you to think..
我们像动物一样  随地交配撒欢012---that we're animals who do it whenever we want.
我没那样想012---Well,I don't think that.
在今天之前  我从未想过你们会做爱012---Before today,I never thought of you two having sex at all.
之前的想法要单纯的多012---It was a simpler time.
事实是  爸  我们正在努力012---The truth is,Dad,we're trying.
什么  是啊  我们正在努力弄大肚子012--- What?  Yeah,we're trying to get pregnant.
我的天啊  真是太好了012---Oh,my God,this is so exciting.
快进去继续"努力"  我来看门012---Well,get back in there! I'll guard the door!
没关系  爸  我们可以等会儿再说012---That's okay,Dad,we can wait until later.
我可不同意 你不是正在排卵吗012---I don't think so. Aren't you ovulating?
爸012---Daddy!
你要把握时机  小公主012---You gotta get at it,princess.
当年你妈跟我试着要怀你的时候012---When your mother and I were trying to conceive you..
只要她在排卵  我们就做012---whenever she was ovulating,bam,we did it!
所以我现在臀部都落下了病根012---That's how I got my bad hip.
真好笑   你们的对话简直012---That's funny. This conversation's
让我的脑袋像被子弹打穿一样012---how I got the bullet hole in my head.
有一次我把膝盖架到洗手台上012---This one time I had my knee on the sink,
而你妈...012---and your mother, she was..
我想我们不需要知道012---I don't think we need to hear
你跟我妈的特殊体位012---the specific positions you and Mom had.
没错  现在的问题是你们的体位012---You're right. This is about your positions.
我刚看到你们在更衣室里012---Now,what I saw in the closet
采用的并非是最佳受孕体位012---is not the optimum position..for conceiving a child.
虽然那感觉可能会很爽012---Although it might feel good.
我现在感觉非常不爽012---I don't feel good right now.
但是快感是很重要的012---But pleasure is important,
而且如果女人达到高潮  受孕会更容易012---and it helps if the woman has an orgasm.
你能完成任务吗  猛男012---You up to the task,sailor?
我需要告诉你一件事012---Oh,I need to tell you something.
现在正是时候012---Well,now's a good time.
我正要去把我的耳朵切掉012---I'm on my way to have my ears cut off.
乔伊要我嫁给他012---Joey asked me to marry him.
什么  乔伊向我求婚012--- What?  Joey proposed to me.
他疯了吗  你才刚生下罗斯的孩子012---Is he crazy? You just had Ross' baby!
我答应了012---Well,I said yes.
什么  你疯了吗012---What,are you crazy?
你才刚生下罗斯的孩子012---You just had Ross' baby!
那太不合适了  不  比那更恶劣012---It's so inappropriate. No,it is worse than that.
简直是有违道德  简直012---It is wrong. It's...
钻戒比我的大多了012---It is bigger than mine!
我知道012---I know.
《我们的日子》 真是太感谢电视了012---Days of our Lives,thank you very much.
你不能嫁给他  为什么不能012--- You can't marry him.  Why not?
我不想要一个人苦撑012---Come on,I don't want to do this alone,
而且他是个好人012---and he's such a sweet guy.
而且他很爱我012---And he loves me so much.
那你爱他吗012---Well,do you love him?
当然012---Sure.
当然  是啊  我是说  随便啦012--- Sure?  Yeah,I mean,whatever.
亲爱的  问题是012---Honey,the question is..
你是真的想嫁给乔伊吗012---do you really want to marry Joey?
不012---No.
不  我不想012---No,I don't.
你能行行好帮我去告诉他吗012---Could you be a dear and go tell him?
你还没告诉瑞秋你当时不是在求婚吗012---You still haven't told Rachel you weren't proposing?
没  她戴上了戒指012---No. She had the ring on..
她看起来很兴奋  然后她露出胸部012---she seemed so excited,and then she took her breast out.
乔伊  你得告诉她真相012---Joey,you have to tell her what's going on.
胸部看起来怎样012---And what did it look like?
我没看到012---I didn't look at it.
大部分都被那死小孩的头给挡住了012---The stupid baby's head was blocking most of it.
马上去跟瑞秋说  别等罗斯发现012---Go and tell Rachel right now,before Ross finds out.
听着  事情没那么简单012---Look,it's not that easy.
她说她想要嫁给我012---She said she wanted to marry me.
我不想伤害她012---I don't want to hurt her.
好啦  反正  就温和地告诉她012---Okay,look,just do it gently.
你说的没错  很有道理012---You're right. You're right.
我得在罗斯知道之前赶快说清楚012---I'll go tell her now before Ross finds out,
而且我会很温和的012---and I'll be gentle.
我办得到的  我是个温和的人012---I can do that. I am a gentle person.
对了  有两个人在里面胡搞012---By the way,two people screwing in there
你可以饱饱眼福012---if you want to check that out.
我听说订婚的事了012---Listen,I heard about the engagement.
惊讶吧012---Surprised?
而且很困惑012---And confused.
瑞秋  亲爱的012---Rach,sweetie..
我没有向你求婚012---I didn't propose to you.
我知道012---I know.
我觉得你并不知道012---I don't think you do.
你没有向我求婚012---You didn't propose to me.
是乔伊向我求婚012---Joey did.
可怜的宝贝  你累坏了012---Poor baby,you're so tired.
瑞秋  我没有向你求婚012---Rach,I didn't propose to you.
乔伊没有向你求婚012---Joey didn't propose to you.
钱德勒也没有向你求婚012---And Chandler didn't propose to you.
你没有向我求婚012---You didn't propose to me.
钱德勒没有向我求婚012---Chandler didn't propose to me.
但是乔伊有012---But Joey did.
乔伊向你求婚012---Joey proposed to you?
我可以等一下再来  等等  等等012--- I can come back.  Wait. Wait. Wait.
乔伊  你有向她求婚吗  没有012--- Joey,did you propose to her?  No.
你有  事实上  严格说来  我没有012--- Yes,you did.  Actually,technically,I didn't.
那你为什么给我戒指呢  等一下012--- Well,then,why did you give me a ring?  Wait.
戒指是你给她的?012---You gave her the ring?
没有  而且我也没向她求婚012---No,and I did not ask her to marry me.
有  你有  不  我没有012--- Yes,you did.  No,I didn't.
你有  我没有012--- Yes,you did.  No,I didn't.
你有  别再说你没有了012---Yes,you did,and don't you say you didn't!
他当时就在床前012---He was right there.
单膝跪地  然后向我求婚012---He got down on one knee and he proposed.
你单膝跪地  是啊  形象全毁012--- You were down on one knee?  Yeah,that looks bad.
但是我并没有求婚012---But  I didn't, I didn't propose.
那到底是怎么回事012---Then what did happen?
是啊  到底是怎么回事012---Yeah,what did happen?
是这样的  当时戒指掉到了地上012---Okay,the ring fell on the floor,
然后我蹲下去捡012---and I went down to pick it up..
然后你就以为我是在求婚012---and you thought I was proposing.
但是你嘴里说着"嫁给我好吗"012---Yeah,but you said,"Will you marry me?"
不  我没说  有  你有012--- No,I didn't.  Yes,you did.
不  我没有012---No,I didn't.
有  你有  噢  天啊  你并没有012---Yes,you did. Oh,my God,you didn't.
你为什么不早点说呢012---Why didn't you tell me that before?
我也想啊  但是一直有人进来打断012---Well,I tried.. but people kept coming in,
然后你又露出胸部012---and then you took your breast out.
你看到她的胸部了012---You saw her breast?
我待会再告诉你  冷静点012---I'll tell you about it later. Be cool.
那乔伊你拿个戒指搞什么012---Then Joey, what the hell were you doing with an engagement ring?
那不是我的戒指  是罗斯的012---It wasn't my ring! It's Ross' ring.
正因此我才觉得好内疚  瑞秋012---That's why I felt so bad, Rach,
因为他本来是打算求婚的012---because he was gonna propose.
什么012---What?!
你本来要向我求婚012---You were gonna propose to me?
没有012---No.
噢  这下尴尬了012---Well,this is awkward.
但是我本来是要问你012---But I was going to see if,you know,
是否愿意跟我重新开始012---maybe you wanted to start dating again.
但  我是说  仅此而已  瑞秋012---But that,I mean,that was all,Rach.
老兄  勇敢点吧  我都求婚了012---Dude,step up. I proposed.
不  你没有012---No,you didn't.
没错  发生太多事了012---That's right. There's a lot going on here,
我之前一定是吃了什么腐坏的水果012---and I think I ate some bad fruit earlier.
嘿  她刚醒来  而且饿了012---Hey,she just woke up. She's hungry.
我们再来试试看吧012---Why don't we give this another try?
我不敢相信你竟然告诉她我要求婚012---I can't believe you told her I was gonna propose.
我不敢相信你竟然不打算求婚012---I can't believe you're not gonna propose.
嘿  我才不要头脑发热一时冲动呢012---Hey,I am not gonna rush into anything.
是啊  老兄  我完全理解012---Yeah,dude,I totally understand.
在跟一个女人有了小孩之后012---Usually after I have a baby with a woman,
才想着要放慢脚步012---I like to slow things down!
噢  天啊   怎么了012--- Oh,my God!  What?
她在吸了  她在吸奶了  瞧啊012---She's doing it! She's breastfeeding! Look.
真是太美了012---It's beautiful.
我等一下再回来抱她  好的012--- I'll come back for her later. OK
谢谢你012---Thank you.
哇  感觉好怪012---Wow,this feels weird.

简直爽透了012---Wonderful weird.

我很抱歉  我搞出来的闹剧012---And I'm sorry about everything.
亲爱的  别担心  是我的错012---Honey,don't worry,it was my mistake.
不  瑞秋  我应该早点告诉你的012---No,Rach,I should've told you sooner.
只不过...012---It's just that..

她真是完美012---She's perfect.
我们真幸运012---We're so lucky.
我们确实很幸运012---We really are.
听着  我知道那不是求婚012---Look,I know it's not a proposal,
我也不知道你的意思如何012---and I don't know where you are..
但是有了艾玛之后  我...012---but with everything that's been going on and with Emma,I'm..
我一直感到...  是的  我懂012--- I've been feeling..  Yeah,I know.

那么或许我们可以再考虑在一起012---Then maybe at least we can talk about us again?
是啊  或许吧012---Yeah. Maybe.
那  很好  好的012---Well,good. Okay.
我想着  如果我们  如果...012---I kind of think,you know,if we,if..
你手上戴着戒指012---You're wearing the ring.
你说什么012---What's that?
你告诉菲比你订婚了012---And you told Phoebe you were engaged.
不好意思  你说什么012---I'm sorry,what?
当你以为乔伊是在求婚012---When you thought Joey proposed..
你有答应吗012---did you say yes?
孩子们  我找了一下医生012---Kids,I spoke to a doctor
拿了些受孕教育手册012---and picked up these pamphlets on how to get pregnant.
嗨  爸  嗨012--- Hey,Dad.  Hi.
