这只小猫叫手套  这只是费修012---This kitty is Mittens. This one is Fitzhugh.
然后住在猫公寓的小公猫是金吉012---And this little guy in the cat condo is Jinkies.
好多猫噢  裘琳012---That's a lot of cats,Jo Lynn.
你是单身吧012---Single,are you?
钱德勒·宾012---Chandler Bing.
为什么是你自己接电话呢012---How come you're answering your own phone?
你的疯狂助理去哪了012---Where's your crazy assistant?
什么事  乔伊012---What's up,Joe?
有什么事是我们一直想一起做的012---Ok, What have we always wanted to do together?
帮彼此编辫子  然后在海边骑马吗012---Braid each other's hair and ride horseback on the beach?
不不不  你明晚回家时012---No. No. No. When you get home tomorrow night..
你跟我要去看奇才队对尼克斯队球赛012---you and I are gonna be at the WizardsKnicks game,
场边座位012---courtside!
场边座位  我的天啊  是啊012--- Courtside? Oh,my God!  Yeah!
或许迈克尔·乔丹会扑过来抢球012---Maybe Michael Jordan will dive for the ball
然后用他的膝盖撞断我的下巴012---and break my jaw with his knee!
真是太酷了  我来告诉莫妮卡012---That is so cool. I'll let Monica know.
喂  乔伊刚打电话来012--- Hello?  Joey just called.
他帮我买到了012---He's got courtside
明晚尼克斯队比赛的场边座位012---Knicks tickets for him and me tomorrow night.
是吗012---Really?
但是明晚是我唯一012---But tomorrow night's the only night
不用上班的晚上012---I get off from the restaurant.
如果你去看球赛012---If you go to the game,
我们会有一星期没有办法在一起012---we won't have a night together for another week.
但是亲爱的  那是场边座位012---But honey,it's courtside!
啦啦队就在正前012---The cheerleaders will be right in..
这样可不能说服你012---That's not the way to convince you.
我不想要成为那种老婆  老是说012---I don't wanna be one of those wives that says:
"你不能去看球赛  你要陪我"012---"You can't go to the game. You have to spend time with me."
所以如果你自己能够意识到012---So if you could just realize it on your own..
我知道  你说的对012---I know. You're right.
我也想要见到你012---I wanna see you too.
我得要想想怎么告诉乔伊012---I gotta figure out a way to tell Joey.
他是满心期待着012---He's looking forward to this.
告诉他你很久没有见到老婆了012---Tell him you haven't seen your wife in a long time.
告诉他长距离关系012---Tell him that having a longdistance relationship
是很难维系的012---is really difficult.
告诉他我们有限的相处时间012---Tell him that what little time we have together
是很宝贵的012---is precious.
我会想想别的012---I'll think of something.
《老友记》  第九季 第9集  瑞秋的电话号码012---Friends S09E09 The One With Rachel's Phone Number
你看起来012---You look..

菲比的麦克吗  是啊012--- Phoebe's Mike?  Yeah.
我不知道你们很熟  我们没有012--- I didn't know you hung out.  We don't..
但是我想要多了解他012---but I'd like to get to know him.
或许用点晚餐  喝点酒  然后聊聊天012---Maybe have a little dinner,drinks,conversation.
太有爱了 罗斯跟麦克的第一次约会012---That's so cute. Ross and Mike's first date.
那会不会很尴尬  你们要聊些什么呢012---Will that be awkward? What are you gonna talk about?
我不知道  但是你知道的012---I don't know. But you know,
我们有许多共同点  明白吗012---we have a lot in common,you know?
他会弹钢琴  我在大学弹过电子琴012---He plays piano. I played keyboards in college.
他离过婚  我在那方面也有些经验012---He's been divorced. I have some experience in that area.
请进  嗨012--- Yeah?  Hi!
果真是女人之夜012---Girl's night out indeed.
我想艾玛今晚可能已经睡了012---So I think Emma is probably down for the night..
但是如果你们需要012---but if you need anything..
瑞秋  我们会没事的012---Rach, We'll be fine.
祝你们玩得愉快  好的  你们也是012--- You go have fun.  Okay,you too.

欢迎造访012---So,welcome.
我有啤酒  我有瓶装母乳012--- I got beer.  I got bottled breast milk.
我看我们先喝啤酒好了 好的012--- Why don't we start with the beer.  Okay.
菲比告诉我你会弹钢琴  是啊012--- So Phoebe tells me you play piano.  Yeah.
我在大学的时候也会弹电子琴012---You know,I used to play keyboards in college.
你这里有吗012---Do you have one here?
没有012---No.
好吧012---Okay.
你知道的  我离过婚012---You know,I'm divorced.
菲比  菲比说你  你也离过婚012---Phoebe.. Phoebe says you're.. You've been divorced?
是的  是啊012---Yeah,yeah.
很抱歉  我真的不太喜欢谈那事012---Yeah,I'm sorry. I don't really like to talk about it.
没关系  我们可以聊别的012---That's okay. We'll talk about something else.
你是古生物学家  是吗  是啊012--- So you're a paleontologist,right?  Yeah.
我表哥也是古生物学家012---My cousin's a paleontologist.
他跟我可能会有较多话题可以聊012---Well,he and I would probably have a lot to talk about.
欢迎回家  瞧瞧你012--- Welcome home.  Well,look at you.
是啊  觉得怎样呢012---Yeah. What do you think?
看起来很棒  只不过012---Well,it looks great. It's just..
我里面穿的也跟你一样  所以012---I'm wearing the same thing underneath,so..
你知道我的意思吗012---You see what I mean?
嘿  为什么你的门是锁着的012---Hey! How come your door's locked?
等一下  不不不012--- Just a second!  No,no,no!
不能让乔伊看到我在这里012---Joey can't know I'm here.
为什么不能012---Why not?
因为我不知道怎么告诉他012---Because I didn't know how to tell him that
我不能去看尼克斯队的球赛012---I couldn't go to the Knicks game..
所以我跟他说我要留在塔尔萨012---so I told him I had to stay in Tulsa.
所以你跟他说谎012---So you lied to him?
说谎比费口舌解释要好太多了012---It's always better to lie than to have the complicated discussion.
除了跟你之外012---Except with you.
嘿  开门  是怎么回事012---Hey,open the door! What's going on?
你在干么  嗨012--- What are you..?  Hi.
你为什么穿成这样呢012---Why are you dressed like that?
因为钱德勒几天以后就要回来了012---Because Chandler's gonna be home in a couple of days..
所以我觉得自己可以...012---so I thought I would just,
先  练习一下妩媚的技巧012---you know,practice the art of seduction.
我刚刚好像听到有男人的声音012---I thought I heard a man's voice before.
没有  我只是在扮钱德勒说话012---No,I was just doing Chandler's side of the conversation.
你知道的  就像是012---You know,like,
"嗨  我看起来如何"012---"Hi,how do I look?"
"真性感  我还能比现在更性奋吗"012---"Really sexy. Could I be any more turned on?"
明白吗012---You know?
好的  等一下012---Okay. Wait a minute.
为什么有两杯酒呢012---Why are there two glasses of wine out?
因为有一杯是要给你的012---Because one of them is for you!
干杯  好了  再见012---Cheers! Okay,byebye.
真有意思012---You know,it's funny.
我自己也一直在练习勾引的技巧012---I've been practicing the art of seduction myself.
你最好继续加强练习  是噢012--- You might wanna keep practicing.  Yeah.
是乔伊  什么012--- It's Joey.  What?
嘿  乔伊  老兄  快回家012--- Hey,Joe.  Dude,come home!
什么  为什么  快回家012--- What? Why?  Come home!
听着  我不行  是怎么回事012---Look,I can't. What's going on?
我不知道要怎么开口012---I don't know how to tell you this,
但是我觉得莫妮卡有外遇012---but I think Monica's cheating on you!
早就告诉过你  你不应该娶一个012---I told you,you shouldn't have married
比你性感那么多的人012---someone hotter than you!
如果你没有办法回来处理这事012---If you can't deal with this,
那我去处理012---then I'm gonna.
不  我刚听到他的声音了012--- No!  I just heard him!
你现在有听到他的声音吗012---Can you hear him now?
没有  好了  我要进去了012---No. All right,I'm going in.
不  等等  我又听到他了012--- No,wait!  I heard him again!
好了  你就待在那里别动012---All right,just stay there.
我要回家了012---I'm coming home.
很好  等你回来的时候见012---Ok, great, I'll see you when you get here.
我会在门外守着  以免他逃了012---I'll wait out in the hall in case he comes out.
有那个必要吗012---Is that really necessary?
当然  你也会为我这样做的012---Absolutely. You'd do it for me.
不是说你会有机会那样做012---Not that you ever have to,
因为我知道要如何满足我的女人012---because I know how to keep my women satisfied.
披萨不是早就该到了吗012---Shouldn't the pizza be here by now?
我是说  他们说不用30分钟就会到012---I mean,they said 30 minutes or less.
已经多久了呢012---Well,how long has it been?
11分钟012---Eleven minutes.
现在是12分钟012---And now 12.
你喜欢这啤酒吗  是的  我喜欢012--- So you like the beer?  I do. I do.
不过  这事实上是窖藏啤酒012---Although,it's actually a lager.
那普通啤酒跟窖藏啤酒有什么不同呢012---What's the difference between beer and lager?
我不知道012---I don't know.
我们可以查一查012---We could look it up.
真是越来越失控了012---Things are about to get wild.
天啊  还记得以前的女生之夜吗012---Oh,God,remember the girls' nights we used to have..
坐在一起讨论你跟罗斯的事吗012---sitting around talking about you and Ross?
噢  天啊  感觉好像是上辈子的事012---Oh,God! It seems like forever ago.
我知道012---I know.
那  你跟罗斯是怎样了呢012---So,what's going on with you and Ross?
噢  我不知道012---Well,I don't know.
我是说  好长时间都无事发生012---I mean,for a long time,nothing.
但是  事实上  就在你来接我之前012---But you know,actually,right before you picked me up..
罗斯跟我有个小小的"火花"012---Ross and I had a little thing.
噢  我的天  我最爱小火花012---Oh,my God! I love things!
发生什么事012---What happened?
他先是告诉我  他喜欢我的样子012---Well,first he told me he liked how I looked.
然后我们来了个小小的012---And then we had a little..
眼神接触012---eye contact.
眼神接触012---Eye contact?
我希望你们有用避孕措施012---I hope you were using protection.
打扰一下012---Excuse me,
这些是吧台最后那两位先生请的012---these are from the two gentlemen at the end of the bar.
我们应该回请他们什么的吗012---Should we send them something back?
我们请他们吃土豆泥好了012---Let's send them mashed potatoes!
不  等等  别那么做012---No,wait! Don't do that!
那样他们就会认为他们可以过来012---That'll make them think they can come over.
所以呢  过来又如何呢012---So,what if they do?
我们不是来这里钓男人的012---We're not here to meet guys.
你有男友  我有小孩还有罗斯012---You have a boyfriend. I have a baby and a Ross.
是啊  但又不会发生什么事012---Yeah,but nothing has to happen.
只是玩玩而已012---We're just having fun.
不是每件事都得发展到眼神接触地步的012---You know,not everything has to go as far as eye contact.
钱德勒  你得告诉乔伊012---Chandler,you have to tell Joey
你不在塔尔萨012---you're not in Tulsa.
让他认为是你在欺骗我012---Isn't it better for him to think you're cheating on me..
总比他认为我在欺骗他好吧012---than for him to think I'm cheating on him?
我可听说过012---I heard it.
我不想让他误会我有外遇012---I don't want him to think I'm having an affair.
好了  我有个计划012---All right,I've got a plan.
我会从防火梯爬下去012---I'll go down the fire escape..
所有"完美计划"都是从012---Because all good plans start with,
"我会从防火梯爬下去"开始的012---"I'll go down the fire escape."
听我说完  女人012---Hear me out,woman!
我会从防火梯爬下去  然后等着012---I'll go down the fire escape and I'll wait for a while.
然后我从楼梯走上来012---Then when I come up the stairs
就像是我刚从塔尔萨回来一样012---it'll be like I just got back from Tulsa.
然后乔伊跟我进屋012---Joey and I will come in and see
看到这里根本没有男人012---that there's no guy in here.
你难道不怕乔伊会识破吗012---Aren't you afraid that Joey's gonna figure all this out?
我可听说过012---I heard it.
我要等一下012---I'm just gonna wait for a little while.
可怕的鸽子又回来了吗012---The scary pigeon's back?
超大的012---It's huge.
天啊  我不敢相信你住在那栋公寓012---Oh, my god. I can't believe you live in that building.
我奶奶也住在那栋公寓012---My grandmother lives in that building!
艾达·格林  完全不懂尊重个人空间012---Ida Greene? No sense of personal space..
闻起来像鸡  看起来像马铃薯012---kind of smells like chicken,looks like a potato.
"洋芋"是你奶奶012---"Spuds" is your grandmother?
那就是我"阿奶"012---That's my bubbe!
我们要再去几个派对012---So we're on our way to a couple of parties.
或许可以把你们的号码给我们012---Maybe we could get your numbers
如果遇到好玩的  打电话给你们012---and call if we find something fun?
我很抱歉012---I'm sorry,
我们并不期望012---we weren't really looking for anything
和你们会有艳遇发生012---to happen with you guys.
我有男朋友了012---I have a boyfriend.
好的  没关系012--- All right.  It's no big deal.
所以她有男朋友  那你的情形是怎样呢012---So she has a boyfriend. What is your situation?
有点复杂  我并没有男朋友  但是012---Well,it's complicated. I don't actually have a boyfriend,but..
那我可以跟你要电话号码吗012---Then can I have your number?
我很抱歉  不行012---I'm sorry,no.
好的012---Okay.
当然可以012---Oh,sure!
噢  天啊  你给他的电话是真的012---Oh,my God,you're giving your real number!
好的  谢谢  我今晚会打给你012---Okay,thanks. I'll give you a call later tonight.
太好了 再见012--- Great.  Bye.
再见012---Bye.
那真的太棒了012---So that's great.
你  比尔  罗斯  艾玛012---You,Bill,Ross and Emma
会很幸福地生活在一起012---are gonna be so happy together.
你在想什么呢012---What were you thinking?
我不知道  他很可爱012---I don't know. He was cute,
又喜欢我  我冲动之下就给他了012---and he liked me. It was an impulse.
那罗斯怎么办  你们的小火花呢012---But what about Ross? What about your moment?
你不想跟他谈谈吗  不想012--- Don't you wanna talk to him?  No.
不想  因为我非常清楚012---No,because I know exactly
谈话的结果会是怎样012---how the conversation's gonna go.
"嘿  罗斯012---"Hey,Ross,you know,
我觉得我们刚刚有点小火花"012---I think we had a moment before."
"是啊  我也这么认为"012---"Yeah. Me too."
"但是我不太确定012---"Well,but I'm not sure
我是不是想再更进一步"012---I really want to do anything about it."
"是啊  我也不确定"012---"Yeah. Me neither."
我们是不是就住在一起012---"Should we just live together..
然后不要告诉彼此  我们互相的感受012---and not tell each other how we're feeling?"
"是啊  我没意见"012---"Yeah,that works for me."
是啊  我懂你的意思012---Yeah,I see what you mean.
对了  你模仿罗斯真像012---By the way,nice Ross imitation.
但你模仿的瑞秋不够爱发牢骚012---Your Rachel wasn't whiny enough.
嗯嘿  好多了012--- Well.. Hey!  Better.
重点是我或许应该停止等待012---The point is maybe I should just stop waiting around
跟罗斯之间的小火花012---for moments with Ross.
我是说  我要继续过我自己的生活了012---You know? I should just move on with my life.
真的  你要放弃罗斯了012---So really,you're moving on from Ross?
我不知道  我得现在就做决定吗012---I don't know. Do I have to decide right now?
你好像已经做了012---You kind of just did.
那男的今晚会打电话给你012---That guy is gonna call you tonight.
罗斯会接起电话012---Ross will pick up the phone,
那传达的讯息已经很明显了012---and that's a pretty clear message.
噢  天啊  罗斯012---Oh,my God,Ross!
罗斯会接起电话012---Ross is gonna pick up the phone.
我得拿回我的电话号码012---I have to get my number back.
噢  天啊  他走了012---Oh,my God,he's gone!
"我得拿回我的电话号码012---"Oh,I have to get my number back!
噢  天啊  他走了"模仿的真棒012---Oh,my God! He's gone!" Dead on.
我想我该走了  这么快吗012--- You know,I'm gonna take off.  So soon?
是啊  好的012--- Yeah.  Okay.
嗯  谢谢你带啤酒过来012---Well,thanks.. Thanks for the beer.
你是说窖藏啤酒吧012---You mean lager?
是啊  快乐时光012---Yeah. Good times.
喂  嘿  麦克  是我012--- Hello?  Hey,Mike,it's me.
听着  罗斯在你旁边吗012---Listen,is.. Is Ross near you?
不在  我刚走012---No,I just left.
你得再回去012---Well,you have to go back in.
什么  回去  回到时光暂停之地吗012---What? Go back? To the land where time stands still?
我很抱歉  亲爱的  但是012---I'm so sorry,honey,but..
瑞秋把自己的号码给了一个男人012---Okay,Rachel gave this guy her number..
她不希望罗斯去接电话012---and she doesn't want Ross to answer the phone.
所以你必须拦截他所有的电话012---So you have to intercept all his calls.
我不能那样做012---I can't do that!
他说他不能那样做  电话给我012--- He says he can't do that.  Give me the phone.
麦克  听着012---Hi,Mike. Hi,listen,
我知道这个要求很过分012---I know that this is a lot to ask,
但是你知道吗  如果你照做012---but you know what? If you do this,
菲比会做一切你想要她做的事012---Phoebe will do anything you want.
真的  我说得是很下流的事012---Seriously,I'm talking dirty stuff.
喂012---Hello?
嗨  我替她道歉012---Hi,I'm sorry about her.
但事实上  关于下流的事  她说的没错012---But actually,she wasn't wrong about the dirty stuff.
好了  我照做012---All right,I'll do it.
但说真的  能有多下流呢012---But really,how much dirtier can it get?
噢  麦克012---Oh,Mike.
再见012---Bye.
嘿  老兄012---Hey,buddy.
我可以回来吗  为什么012--- Can I come back in?  Why?
我只是在想  我们012---Well,I was just thinking about
还有很多东西可以聊012---how much more we have to talk about.
但是你都走了012---But you left.
你倒是挺快的012---That didn't take long.
你不是说塔尔萨到这里要飞三小时吗012---I thought you said Tulsa was,like,a threehour flight?
你忘了把时差算进去了012---Well,you're forgetting about the time difference.
钱德勒  你回来了012---Chandler,you're home!
没错  你老公回来了012---That's right! Your husband's home!
所以现在性爱派对可以停止了012---So now the sex can stop!
你在说什么012---What are you saying?
乔伊说你跟另一个男人在一起012---Joey said you're here with another man!
这里根本没有男人012---There's no man in here!
你怎么敢这样诬赖我012---How dare you accuse me of that!
好吧  那或许你不介意012---All right. Then maybe you won't mind
我和我的朋友到处看看012---if me and my friend take a look around.
他在做什么012---What's he doing?
我把枕头做成人形在床上012---I arranged some pillows on the bed to look like a guy.
卧室没有人012---Bedroom's clear.
不过你们可能需要换新的枕头了012---Although you might need some new pillows.
好了  那我去检查客房012---All right,well,I'll check the guest room.
我为什么闻到男人的古龙水味012---Why do I smell men's cologne?
我想那是你的味道012---I think that's you.
噢  对噢012---Oh,yeah.
我刚刚才用杂志磨擦到自己身上012---I rubbed a magazine on myself earlier.
里面没有人  乔伊012---There's nobody here,Joe.
