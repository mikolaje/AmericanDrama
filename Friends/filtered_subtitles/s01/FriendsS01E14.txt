不用我再说第三位了吧012---I don't think we need a third.
打扰了，可以给颗全蛋吗 有壳的那种012---Excuse me. Could we get an egg over here, still in the shell?
蛋？012---An egg?
对，你就上前跟她说 蛋还你012---Yeah. Go up to her and say, "Here's your egg back. I'm returning your egg."

罗杰明晚要约她出去012---Roger wants to take her out.
菲比，不行，你难道忘了 当初为什么甩掉他的012---No. Pheebs. Don't you remember why you dumped the guy?
因为他让人毛骨耸然012---Because he was creepy.
刻薄 又让人有点害怕012---And mean. And a little frightening.

- 今晚呢 - 不行，不准反悔012---- Oh. Uh, listen, about tonight... - No, no, don't you dare bail on me.
她答应跟我约会，就是因为 我答应帮她朋友找伴012---She's only going out with me because I'm bringing a friend for her friend.
但她朋友听来似乎是…012---But her friend sounds like such a...
可悲惨又很糟 这我知道，但…012---Pathetic mess. I know, but...
别这样啦，老兄，她很渴望 很脆弱012---Come on, man, she's needy, she's vulnerable.
我想呢012---I'm thinking:
谢了012---Thanks.

是珍妮丝012---Hey, it's Janice.
我要逃走了 从窗户出去012---Okay, I'm making a break for it. I'm going out the window.
别走啦，拜托 我想约洛莲好久了012---No, don't, please. I've been waiting for forever to go out with Lorraine.
- 冷静点 - 冷静？012---- Just calm down. - Calm down? Calm down?
一个五个月内被我甩过两次的女人 你硬把我们凑成对012---You set me up with a woman I've dumped twice in the last five months.
喂012---Hey.
别对我吼好吗 这让我好紧张012---Can you stop yelling? You're making me nervous...
我一紧张就尿不出来012---...and I can't go when I'm nervous.
抱歉，你说的没错012---I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You're right.
快点，快尿 快尿012---Come on! Do it, do it, do it! Come on!
好啦，罗杰是很怪 但跟皮特卡尼比起来不算什么012---Okay, Roger was creepy, but he was nothing compared to Pete Carney.
- 皮特·卡尼谁？ - 爱哭鬼皮特？012---- Which one was he? - Pete the Weeper?
每次做爱都会哭的家伙 还记得吗？012---Remember the guy that used to cry every time we had sex?
〝你也舒服吗？〞012---"Oh, was it good for you?"
小哭一下何妨 总比不服输霍华〝强〞012---Well, I'd take a little crying any day over Howard, the "I win" guy.
〝我赢了，我赢了〞012---"I win. I win."
跟他约会两个月 都没赢过012---I went out with him for two months. I didn't get to win once.
我们人这么好 怎会找到这些混蛋呢？012---How do we end up with these jerks? We're good people.
不知道，可能是因为 我们拥有特别磁力012---I don't know. I think we're like some kind of magnets.
我确定我有 所以我才不能戴数位手表012---I know I am. That's why I can't wear a digital watch.
你那瓶酒比较多，对吧？012---There's more beer, right?
记得我那个 把头理光的朋友艾比吗？012---Oh. You know my friend Abby who shaves her head?

情人节 很适合012---It's Valentine's Day. It's perfect.
怎样的仪式012---Okay, well, what kind of ritual?
像是把他们送的东西烧掉012---Okay, we can, um, burn the stuff they gave us.
或者…？012---Or?
或者可以脱光了又唱又跳 拿根木棍012---Or we can chant and dance around naked, you know, with sticks.
- 烧束西比较好 - 烧东西比较好012---- Burning's good. - Burning's good.
我有可以烧的东西012---RACHEL: I've got stuff to burn.
这个呢012---You know...
打从我小时候 我就有办法用脚趾捡硬币012---...ever since I was little, I've been able to pick up quarters with my toes.
是吗？好了不起012---Yeah? Good for you.
几枚硬币 还是整捆硬币？012---Uh, quarters or rolls of quarters?
顺道一提，钱德 照片上有你的都被我剪了012---By the way, Chandler, I cut you out of all of my pictures.
如果你想要的话 有一整袋子都是你的头012---So if you want, I have a bag with just your heads.
不用了012---That's okay.
真的吗？因为可以拿来 作成小玩偶012---Are you sure? Because you could make little puppets out of them.
然后放在残酷剧场演戏012---And you could use them in your Theater of Cruelty.
不能这样012---We can't do that.
啥？不能怎样？012---What? What can't you do?
可以私下一聊？ 到那边？012---Uh, can I talk to you for a second? Over there?
我们想走了012---Uh, we might be leaving now.
你是说我跟你的我们012---Tell me it's you and me "we."
她说想在我全身涂抹东西 再舔掉012---She said she wants to slather my body with stuff and then lick it off.
但我连涂抹是什么意思都不懂012---I'm not even sure what slathering is.
但我很想试试012---But I definitely want to be a part of it.
你不可以这样对我012---Okay, you cannot do this to me.
没错，抱歉 没错012---You're right. I'm sorry. You're right.

裤子拉链跑出来012---...of your zipper since you came back from the bathroom.
不好意思012---Excuse me.
你好012---How you doing?
我们这算是误交损友吗？012---So do we have the best friends, or what?
乔伊算不上朋友 他是…012---Joey's not a friend. He's...
把信用卡留给我们用的笨蛋012---...a stupid man who left us his credit card.
再来一杯？点心？ 大屏幕电视机？012---Another drink? Some dessert? A big-screen TV?

你觉得012---Hey, do you think...?
我邀卡萝过来 一起吃好吗？012---Would it be too weird if I invited Carol over to join us?

我想我们不适合012---I just don't think things are gonna work out.
没关系012---That's fine.
真的吗012---It is? - Mm-hm.
因为我知道还没完012---Because I know that this isn't the end.
事实上，是完了012---Oh, no. You see, actually, it is.
不，才没有 因为你不会允许的012---No, it isn't. Because you won't let that happen.
你到现在还不明白吗012---Don't you know it yet?
你是爱我的，钱德宾012---You love me, Chandler Bing.

她去厕所多久了012---How long has she been in the bathroom?
我猜她应该不在厕所 她外套都拿走了012---Uh, I don't think she's in the bathroom. Her coat is gone.
可能是因为里头冷012---Well, maybe it's cold in there.
看来我毁了九年来 第一次有的约会012---Maybe I screwed up the first date I had in nine years.

我知道你想说什么 你爱女生012---No, no, I know what you're gonna say. You're a lesbian.
但暂时把那搁下来如何012---But what do you say we just put that aside for now, you know?
把它先放在一旁好吗012---Let's just stick a pin in it, okay?
因为我们很处得来012---Because we're great together, you know?
这你不否认吧012---You can't deny it.
何况你肚里还有我的小孩012---And besides, you're carrying my baby.

我爱你012---I love you.
我也爱你012---I love you too.
- 但… - 别说但是012---- But... - No "but." No "but."
你知道这件我们搁下的事 怎么样了吗？012---You know that thing we put over here with the pin in it?
迟早会浮现的012---It's time to take the pin out.
耶012---Yeah.
你会找到合适的人的，一定会 有个人在等着你012---You'll find someone. I know you will. The right woman is waiting for you.
说的简单 因为你有人了012---It's easy for you to say. You found one already.
只要有个喜欢男人的女人 就好了012---All you need is a woman who likes men and you'll be set.
不是她012---Not her.
我们午夜结束 过来接你们如何012---We get off around midnight. Why don't we pick you up then?
