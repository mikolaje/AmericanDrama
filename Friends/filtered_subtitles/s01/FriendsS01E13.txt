- 抱歉 - 天啊，我受够了012---- I'm sorry. - Oh, my God. That's it.
你不敲门就闯进来012---You just barge in here and you don't knock?
难道你不尊重别人的隐私权012---You have no respect for anybody's privacy.
- 瑞秋，你等一下   - 不，你等一下012---- Rachel, wait.  - No, you wait.
- 我能说一件事吗    - 什么事012---- Can I just say one thing? - What? What?
这块布编得非常松 我仍能看见…012---That's a relatively open weave and I can still see your...
- 你的两点   - 哦！012---...nippular area. - Ugh!
《老友记》 第一季 第13集：乳房风波012---Friends S01E13: The One with the Boobies
亲爱的，告诉他们你病人的故事012---Honey, honey, tell them the story about your patient...
那个人如何把事想成另一件事012---...who thinks things are other things.
你知道吗012---You know?
例如电话响时她就去洗澡012---Like when the phone rings and she takes a shower...
差不多就是那样012---That's pretty much it.
但你说得很好，甜心012---But you tell it really well, sweetie.
谢谢012---Thanks. Okay.
快走开 这样我们才能谈你012---Now go away so we can talk about you.
好吧 我会想念你的012---Okay. I'll miss you.
他很不错吧012---Isn't he great?
他好可爱，也好像很喜欢你012---He's so cute. And he likes you so much.
我知道012---I know. I know.
他人很好，而且很复杂，知道吗？012---He's so sweet. And so complicated, you know?
以一位精神科医师来讲 不会太神经质012---And for a shrink, he's not too "shrinky." You know?
他会在沙发上做吗012---So you think you'll do it on his couch?
我不知道…有点奇怪012---Oh. I don't know. That's a little weird.
聚乙稀做的012---It's vinyl.
好，大家还想要别的东西吗012---Okay. You guys want anything else? - Oh, yes.
- 要，我要… - 抱歉，卖完了012---- Could I have...? - Sorry, we're all out.
其他人呢？012---Anybody else? - Okay.
我是否错过什么事012---Did I, uh, miss something?
她很生气 因为我看见她的乳房012---No, she's still upset because I saw her boobies.
你是怎么看到她的乳房的012---What were you doing seeing her boobies?
那是意外012---It was an accident.
这跟拿望远镜 和甜甜圈过街的感觉不同012---I wasn't across the street with a telescope and a box of doughnuts.
能换个话题吗012---Can we change the subject, please?
没错，因为那不是她的乳房 而是她的胸部012---Because, hello? These aren't her "boobies." These are her breasts.
菲比，我要的不只是改变说法012---Pheebs, I was hoping for more of a change.
你为什么要难为情呢？ 你的乳房还蛮不错的012---I don't know why you're embarrassed. They were very nice boobies.
〝不错〞？012---"Nice"?
它们很〝不错〞？012---They were "nice"?
就这样？手套也很不错012---That's it? I mean, mittens are "nice."
好，我真是…012---Okay. Rock, hard place...
左右为难012---...me.
你真搞笑012---You're so funny.
他真的很搞笑012---He's really funny.
他不讲笑话的时候 我可不想待在这里012---I wouldn't want to be there when the laughter stops.
等等，回去上一句012---Whoa, whoa. Back up there, sparky.
那是什么意思？012---What did you mean by that?
你似乎有亲密上的问题012---It seems that maybe you have intimacy issues...
你用你的幽默和人保持距离012---...that you use your humor to keep people at a distance.
呵012---Huh.
我是说，我才刚认识你 我也从来没听说过你012---I mean, hey, I just met you. I don't know you from Adam.
独生子，对吧？012---Only child, right?
父母在你青春期前离婚？012---Parents divorced before you hit puberty.
你怎会知道？012---Uh-huh. How did you know?
典型课本范例012---It's textbook.
各位012---Hey, you guys.
你们都认识我爸吧？012---You all know my dad, right?
- 打算在纽约待多久？ - 就几天012---- How long are you in the city? - A couple of days.
我在市中心有工作012---I got a job midtown.
我想和我儿子一起住012---I figure I'm better off staying with the kid...
比来回坐渡轮好012---...than hauling my ass back and forth on the ferry.
我没见过他012---I don't know this one.
- 他是我朋友罗杰 - 嗨012---- Oh. This is my friend Roger. - Hi.
- 幸会，罗杰 - 彼此彼此012---- Good to meet you. ROGER: You too.
玩布偶的那个怎么了？012---What happened to the, uh, puppet guy?
爸012---- Dad, uh... - Oh, oh.
抱歉012---Excuse me.
罗斯，你老婆还好吗012---So, Ross, uh, how's the wife?
哪壶不开提哪壶了012---Oh for two, huh? Heh.
钱德，快点，说点好笑的012---Uh, Chandler, quick, say something funny.
我得挂电话了 我也想你012---Gotta go. Ha, ha. I miss you too.
我爱你，但现在很晚了012---I love you, but it's getting late now...
让我向她打声招呼 嘿，妈012---Let me say hi. Hey, Ma.
我和包西达大夫约了时间 而且…012---Listen, I made the appointment with Dr. Bassida and...
什么012---Excuse me?
你知道这不是妈妈吗012---Did you know this isn't Ma?
她叫罗妮012---Her name's Ronni.
她从事宠物殡葬业012---She's a pet mortician.
好012---Sure.
你和她多久了…012---So how long have you been...
记得小时候我常带你 去海军军港…012---Remember when you were a kid, I'd take you to the Navy yard...
看大船？012---...and show you the big ships?
- 从那时候就开始了  - 没有，才六年012---- Since then? - No, it's only been six years.
我只想勾起你美好的回忆012---I wanted to give you a nice memory...
让你不会觉得 我一直是个王八蛋012---...so you'd know I wasn't always such a terrible guy.
乔伊，你爱过吗？012---Joe, have you ever been in love?
我不知道012---I don't know.
那就是没有012---Then you haven't.
- 你的蕃茄烧焦了 - 你还好意思说我012---- You're burning your tomatoes. - Hmm. You're one to talk.
乔，你老爸爱得无法自拔012---Joe, your dad's in love, bigtime.
最糟的是我爱上两个不同的女人012---And the worst part is, it's with two different women.
天啊，拜托你告诉我 其中一个是妈012---Oh, man. Please tell me one of them is Ma.
当然其中一个是你妈 你秀逗了？012---Of course one of them's Ma. What's the matter with you?
这就像你某天起床突然发现012---It's like if you woke up one day and found out...
你老爸是个双面人012---...your dad was leading this double life.
好像是为中央情报局工作的间谍012---He's, like, actually some spy working for the CIA.
那到挺酷的012---That'd be cool.
这实在是太逊了012---This blows.
我知道，为何父母就不能 好好当父母012---I know. Why can't parents just stay parents?
为何他们就得成为一般人012---Why do they have to become people?
为何他们要…012---Why do they have...?
为什么…012---Why...
你能不能不要一直盯着 我的胸部看012---...can't you stop staring at my breasts?
什么？012---What?
什么？012---What?
那一天你还看得不够吗？012---Didn't you get a good enough look the other day?
好了…我们都已是成年人012---All right, we're all adults here.
此事只有一个解决方法012---There's only one way to resolve this.
既然你看过她的乳房012---Since you saw her boobies...
你应该让她看你的小鸡鸡012---...I think, uh, you're gonna have to show her your pee-pee.
想都别想012---You know, I don't see that happening.
快点，他说得没错 以眼还眼012---Come on. He's right. Tit for tat.
我不会让你看的012---Well I'm not showing you my tat.
谁啊？012---Hello?
- 是菲比 - 还有罗杰！012---PHOEBE: It's Phoebe. ROGER: And Rog.
快上来012---Come on up.
这下可好，罗杰来了012---Oh, good. Rog is here.
- 罗杰怎么了  - 没什么，小事012---- What's the matter with Rog? - Nothing. It's a little thing.
我讨厌这家伙012---I hate that guy.
为什么 因为他太善于分析 这是职业病啊012---What? So he was a little analytical. That's what he does.
拜托，他没那么糟012---Come on, he's not that bad.
你这里错了！ 如果当初我感觉到她是蕾丝边…012---That's where you're wrong. Why would I marry her...
我何必和她结婚呢？012---...if I thought on any level that she was a lesbian?
我也不确定012---I don't know.
或许你想让你的婚姻失败012---Maybe you wanted your marriage to fail.
- 呵呵 - 为什么 我为什么会这么做012---- Ha, ha. - Why? Why would I? Why?
为什么…为什么012---Why? Why? Why?
我也不确定，或许自信心不足012---I don't know. Maybe low self-esteem?
或许是弥补你抢兄弟姊妹风头的事情 或许…012---Maybe to compensate for overshadowing a sibling. Maybe...
等等，回到兄弟姊妹的话题012---Wait. Go back to that "sibling" thing.
嗯，我不知道012---Well, I don't know.
你让你的婚姻碰壁012---It's conceivable that you sabotaged your marriage...
好显示你兄弟姊妹在父母面前 没那么失败012---...so the sibling would be less of a failure in the parents' eyes.
这太荒谬了 她不成才我一点都不会感到内疚012---That's ridiculous. I don't feel guilty for her failures.
- 你认为我不成才  - 他不错吧012---- Oh, so you think I'm a failure? - Isn't he good?
不，我不是那个意思012---Yeah. No. That's not what I was saying.
多年来我以为你支持我012---All these years, I thought you were on my side...
但或许你婚姻失败的目的是 想巴结爸妈012---...but maybe you were sucking up to Mom and Dad...
好让他们更心疼你012---...so they'd favor you.
嘿，我娶蕾丝边 是想让你看起来更好012---Hey, I married a lesbian to make you look good.
你说得对012---You're right.
我说，你说得对012---I mean, you're right.
那不是威伯的问题 而是威伯游乐宫012---It wasn't just the Weebles, but it was the Weeble Play Palace...
和威伯游轮的问题012---...and the Weeble's Cruise Ship...
它上面的救生艇让威伯能缓缓驶出012---...which had this little lifeboat for the Weebles to wobble in.
那很难受012---That's tough, tough stuff.
菲比，我们现在该走了 不然就赶不上电影了012---Pheebs, if we're gonna catch that movie, we gotta go.
希望你好过一点，瑞秋012---Okay. Feel better, okay?
菲比，我们快来不及了 甜心012---We're gonna be late, sweetie. - Okay.
- 谢谢你做的一切，摩妮卡 - 不客气012---- Listen, thanks for everything, Mon. - No problem.
各位，很高兴和各位再度见面012---It was great seeing you again.
摩妮卡，饼干别吃太多012---Mon, uh, easy on those cookies, okay?
切记，那些东西只是食物…012---Remember, they're just food...
不是爱012---...they're not love.
我讨厌这家伙012---I hate that guy.
晚安，各位012---JOEY: Good night, you guys.
看，这是我们订的女人012---Oh, look. It's the woman we ordered.
嘿，需要帮忙吗012---Hey. Can, uh... Can we help you?
不用，谢谢，我在等乔伊崔比亚尼012---Oh. No, thanks. I'm just waiting for, uh, Joey Tribbiani.
我就是乔伊崔比亚尼012---I'm Joey Tribbiani.
喔，不是你，是老乔伊012---Oh. Oh, no, not you. Big Joey.
天啊012---Oh, my God.
你比照片上帅多了012---You're so much cuter than your pictures.
我是罗妮012---I'm Ronni.
想吃起起司片吗？012---Cheese Nip?
乔伊的脑子有点秀逗了012---Uh, Joey's having an embolism...
但我要起司片012---...but I'd go for a Nip.
大部分人在宠物过世后012---You see, most people, when their pets pass on...
希望他们像睡觉那样躺着012---...they want them laid out like they're sleeping.
但有时有些人要他们摆出姿势012---But occasionally you get a person who wants them in a pose.
像追自己的尾巴012---Like, uh, chasing their tail.
或跳起来接住飞盘012---Or, uh, jumping to catch a Frisbee.
乔伊，如果我先走一步 我的姿势要像找钥匙一样012---Joey, if I go first, I want to be looking for my keys.
- 好好笑！ - 嗨！乔012---- That's a good one. - Hey, Joe.
嗨，爸爸，罗妮来了012---Hey, Dad. Ronni's here.
- 嗨 - 嘿012---- Huh? - Hi.
- 嘿 - 嘿012---- Hey. - Hey.
嘿，亲爱的012---Hello, babe.
你来做什么012---What are...? What are you doing here?
你的假发留在我的住处012---Oh, uh, you left your hair at my apartment.
我想你明天开会用得上012---I figured you'd need it for your meeting.
谢谢012---Thank you. Uh...
谁想玩大老二012---So who's up for a big game of Kerplunk?
听着，我…012---Look, I, uh...
我不该来这里012---I shouldn't have come.
我该走了，我不想错过最后一班地铁012---I gotta go. I'll miss the last train.
不，我不想让你这么晚还搭地铁012---No, I don't want you taking that thing this late.
- 那我要睡哪里  这里吗  - 喔012---- Where am I gonna stay? Here? - Whoa.
我们去住饭店012---We'll go to a hotel.
我们去住饭店012---We'll go to a hotel.
- 不行 - 不行012---- No, you won't. - No, we won't.
你们去饭店就一定会嘿咻012---If you go to a hotel, you'll be doing stuff.
我要你们待在这里 这样我就可以盯着你们012---I want you right here, where I can keep an eye on you.
你要盯着我们012---You're gonna keep an eye on us?
没错，先生012---That's right, mister.
不管你年纪多大 只要住在我家屋檐下…012---I don't care how old you are, while you're here...
一切就得听我的012---...you're gonna live by my rules.
那就是不准你和 你女朋友睡在一起012---And that means no sleeping with your girlfriend.
哇，他好严格012---Wow, he's strict.
爸，你睡我房问012---Dad, you'll be in my room.
罗妮 你睡钱德的房问012---Ronni, uh, you can stay in Chandler's room.
谢谢 你真是个好孩子012---Thanks. You're a good kid.
来，我带你去看我房间012---Come on. I'll show you to my room.
感觉真奇怪 你没说 〝不，谢了，时候不早了〞012---That sounds weird when it's not followed by, "No, thanks, it's late."
好，只有今晚而已 明天你就得做出改变012---Okay. This is just for tonight. Starting tomorrow, you gotta change.
- 六年时间可不短 - 什么改变？012---- Six years is long enough. - What kind of change?
- 和罗妮分手 - 我不能！012---- Break up with Ronni... - I can't.
要不就和我妈离婚 这样是不对的012---Then come clean with Ma. This is not right.
- 对，但是… - 我不想听，快进我房里012---I don't wanna hear it. Now go to my room.
嘿，踢踏舞者012---Hey, kickie.
- 你在干什么？ - 想让自己舒服一点012---- What are you doing? - Trying to get comfortable.
- 穿着内裤我睡不着 - 你非穿不可012---- I can't sleep in my underwear. - Well, you're gonna.
我一直在想…012---I've been thinking...
我总是看见女人叠在女人上面012---...about how I'm always seeing girls on top of girls.
她们是尾对尾相接 还是是像煎饼一样叠起来012---Are they end-to-end, or tall, like pancakes?
你知道我什么意思 这些和我约过会的女人012---You know what I mean. How I date all these women.
因为我总是想 当真命天女出现时012---I always figured, when the right one comes along...
我就会勇往直前，坚持到最后012---...I'll be able to be a standup guy and go the distance, you know?
但如今看见我爸 我想…012---Now I'm looking at my Dad thinking...
你不是他，你是你自己012---You're not him, you're you.
当他们希望你继承你爸的事业时 你有屈服吗012---When they wanted you to go into your father's business, did you cave?
- 没有 - 没有012---- No. - No.
你决心从事没有工作的 演艺事业012---You decided to go into the out-of-work-actor business.
这不是一件容易的事 但你办到了012---That wasn't easy, but you did it.
我也相信 当真命天女出现时012---And I believe that when the right woman comes along...
你会有勇气对她说012---...you'll have the guts to say:
〝抱歉，我已婚〞012---"No thanks, I'm married."
你真的这样认为012---You really think so?
真的，我真的这样认为012---Yeah. I really do.
- 谢谢，钱德 - 滚开012---- Thanks, Chandler. - Get off.
- 嗨 - 嗨012---- Hi. - Hi.
有事吗？012---May I help you?
乔伊说我能用你的浴室 因为钱德正在用我们的012---Uh, Joey said I could use your shower since, uh, Chandler's in ours.
好，你是谁？012---Okay. Who are you?
我叫罗妮 罗妮·罗普拉诺012---- Oh, uh, I'm Ronni. Ronni Rapalono. - Uh-huh.
情妇？012---The mistress?
- 请进 - 谢谢012---- Um, come on in. - Thanks.
我叫瑞秋，浴室在那里012---Hi, I'm Rachel. Bathroom's up there.
嘿，听好，罗妮012---Hey, Ronni.
钱德进浴室多久了？012---How long has Chandler been in the shower?
大约五分钟012---Oh. Like, uh, five minutes.
太好了012---Perfect.
请系好安全带012---Fasten your seat belts...
看小鸡鸡的时间到了012---...it's pee-pee time.
嘿，崔比亚尼先生012---Hey, Mr. Trib.
嘿，早安，亲爱的012---Hey. Good morning, dear.
钱德宾，该换我看你的小东西了012---Chandler Bing, it's time to see your thing.
- 你是怎么搞的  - 我以为你是钱德012---- What's the matter with you? - I thought it was Chandler.
你应该在浴室 这样我才能看见你的小东西012---You were supposed to be in there so I could see your thing.
抱歉，我的小东西在里面 和我在一起012---Sorry, my thing was in there with me.
- 嘿 - 嘿，菲比012---PHOEBE: Hey. ALL: Hey, Pheebs.
- 还好吧？ - 不错012---MONICA: How's it going? - Good. Oh, oh.
罗杰想邀大家一起吃晚餐012---Roger's having a dinner thing and he wanted me to invite you guys.
- 怎么了？ - 没事012---- So, what's going on? - Nothing.
只是…012---It's just that, uh...
是罗杰012---It's Roger.
我不知道，有些事…012---Um, ahem, I don't know. There's something about... Ahem.
基本上我们认为他…012---Basically, we just feel that he's, uh...
我们讨厌他012---We hate that guy.
我们讨厌他012---We hate him.
- 菲此，我们很抱歉 - 好吧012---We're sorry, Pheebs.
嗯哼，对012---Uh-huh. Okay.
是不是他太有洞察力012---Don't you think maybe it's just that he's so perceptive...
所以吓到你们了012---...that it freaked you out?
不，我们讨厌他…012---- No, I hate him. - No, we hate him.
抱歉012---I'm sorry.
妈，你来干什么？012---Ma. What are you doing here?
我把这个带给你012---I came to give you this...
还有这个012---...and this. - Ow.
你的大戒指打到很痛！012---Big ring.
你为什么要对你爸讲一大堆012---Why did you fill your father's head with that garbage...
关于改邪归正的废话呢？012---...about making things right?
- 切事情本来都很好012---Things were fine the way they were.
里面有鸡肉，放冰箱冰好012---There's chicken in there. Put it away.
拜托，乔伊，真的012---For God's sake, Joey. Really.
等一下，你都知道012---Hold on. You knew?
我当然知道  你认为呢012---Of course I knew. What do you think?
你爸又不是詹姆士庞德012---Your father is no James Bond.
你应该听听他的谎言012---You should have heard his cover stories.
〝我在会计家里睡〞012---"I'm sleeping over at my accountant's."
那是什么屁话 拜托012---I mean, what is that? Please.
你怎能…012---So then, how could you...?
记得你爸以前的模样吗012---Do you remember how your father used to be?
总是大呼大叫，总是不开心012---Always yelling. Nothing made him happy.
连工作室和 瓶内的小船也无法让他开心012---Not that wood shop, not those stupid little ships in the bottle.
现在他很开心012---Now he's happy.
这样很好，他好歹有个嗜好012---I mean, it's nice. He has a hobby.
妈，我无意冒犯 但是…012---Ma, I don't mean to be disrespectful, but...
你到底在说什么012---...what the hell are you talking about?
- 我是说，那你怎么办？ - 我很好啊012---- I mean, what about you? - Me? I'm fine.
听着，亲爱的…012---Look, honey...
在理想的世界中012---...in an ideal world...
没有她 而且你爸是个大帅哥012---...there'd be no her and your father would look like Sting.
再告诉你别的012---And I'll tell you something else:
自从那贵妇犬一样的女人出现后012---Ever since that poodle-stuffer came along...
他感觉很羞耻 变得对我很用心012---...he's been so ashamed of himself that he's been more attentive.
并且开始对我体贴012---He's been more loving.
每天都像我们的结婚纪念日012---It's like every day is our anniversary.
我该为你高兴？012---I'm happy for you?
不必了012---Well, don't be.
因为现在全搞砸了012---Because now everything's screwed up.
我只想回到像从前一样012---I just want it the way it was.
妈，对不起012---JOEY: Ma, I'm sorry.
我以为我做了你想做的事012---I just did what I thought you'd want.
我知道，亲爱的，我知道012---I know you did, cookie. Oh, I know you did.
告诉我012---So tell me...
你见到她了吗012---Did you see her?
见到了012---Yeah.
你比她漂亮十倍都不止012---You're 10 times prettier than she is.

你和你爸谈过了012---So you talked to your dad, huh?
