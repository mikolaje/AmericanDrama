《老友记》  第一季  第1集  序集012---Friends S01E01: The Pilot
没什么好说的！他只不过是我的同事012---There's nothing to tell. It's just some guy I work with.
少来了，和你交往的男人…012---Come on. You're going out with a guy.
多多少少一定有点问题！012---There's gotta be something wrong with him.
他既驼背又戴假发？012---So does he have a hump and a hair piece?
等一下，他是不是会吃粉笔？012---Wait. Does he eat chalk?
我只是不希望你 重蹈我和卡尔的覆辙012---I don't want her to go through what I went through with Carl. Oh.
各位放轻松，这不算约会012---Okay, everybody relax. This is not even a date.
不过是两个人一起出去吃晚餐 而且不上床012---It's just two people going out to dinner and not having sex.
对我来说这就是约会012---Sounds like a date to me.
做了个梦，在中学时代 我站在餐厅中央…012---I'm back in high school, in the middle of the cafeteria...
突然发现自己全身赤裸012---...and I realize I'm totally naked.
- 对，没错 - 我做过那样的梦012---- Oh, yeah. - I've had that dream.
我低头一看，看见有一个电话…012---Then I look down and I realize there is a phone...
在那里012---...there.
- 而不是… - 没错012---- Instead of... - That's right!
- 我没做过那样的梦 - 没有012---MONICA: That one, I've never had. PHOEBE: No.
突然，那个电话响了012---All of a sudden, the phone starts to ring.
结果是我妈妈打来的012---And it turns out it's my mother.
这非常奇怪 因为她从来都不会打电话给我！012---Which is very, very weird because she never calls me.
嗨012---Hi.
这家伙说〝嗨〞的时候 我却想杀了我自己012---This guy says "hello," I wanna kill myself.
你还好吧，亲爱的？012---Are you okay, sweetie?
我就感觉好像某人伸手进我的喉咙 抓住我的小肠，从我的嘴里拉出来012---I feel like someone grabbed my small intestine, pulled it out of my mouth...
- 再在我的脖子上打结… - 要吃饼干吗？012---...and tied it around my neck. - Cookie?
卡萝今天搬走了她的东西012---Carol moved her stuff out today.
哦012---PHOEBE & JOEY: Oh.
- 我给你拿杯咖啡 - 谢谢012---- Let me get you some coffee. - Thanks.
呃012---Ew. Unh.
不，不要！ 不要清理我的光环！012---No. No, don't! Stop cleansing my aura.
不要管我的光环，好吗？012---Just leave my aura alone, okay?
我会没事的，好吗？真的 我希望她开心012---I'll be fine. All right? Really. I hope she'll be very happy.
- 不，你并不希望 - 是的，我不希望！012---- No, you don't. - No, I don't.
叫她去死，是她离开了我！012---To hell with her. She left me!
你从来都不知道她是女同性恋012---And you never knew she was a lesbian.
不知道！行了吧！012---No! Okay?
为什么每个人老是要提出来？012---Why does everyone keep fixating on that?
她都不知道，我又怎么会知道？012---She didn't know. How should I know?
有时候我希望我是女同性恋…012---Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian.
我讲得很大声吗？012---Did I say that out loud?
没事的，罗斯 你现在感到很痛苦012---All right, Ross. Look, you're feeling a lot of pain right now.
你很生气，很伤心012---You're angry. You're hurting.
我能告诉你解决方法是什么吗？012---Can I tell you what the answer is?
脱衣舞厅！012---Strip joints!
别这样，你单身了！有需求的！012---Come on, you're single. Have some hormones.
我不想单身，好吗？012---See, but I don't want to be single, okay?
我只想…再次结婚！012---I just wanna be married again.
而我只想要一百万美金！012---And I just want a million dollars!
瑞秋！012---Rachel?
噢，老天爷，摩妮卡 感谢上帝！012---Oh, God, Monica! Hi! Thank God!
我刚到你那里去，而你不在 那个拿着大锤子的家伙说012---I went to your building and this guy with a hammer said...
你可能在这里 你真在这里！012---...that you might be here, and you are.
- 你想喝点咖啡吗？ - 无咖啡因的012---- Can I get you some coffee? - Decaf.
好了，各位，这位是瑞秋 另一个林肯高中的幸存者012---Okay, everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor.
这就是各位 这是钱德、菲比012---This is everybody. This is Chandler and Phoebe...
乔伊，还有 你还记得我哥哥罗斯吗？012---...and Joey. And remember my brother, Ross?
- 当然，嘿！ - 嘿012---- Sure! - Hey.
- 嗨 - 天啊012---- Hi. - Oh, God.
那你现在可以告诉我们了吗 还是说我们在等着四位湿漉的伴娘?012---So you wanna tell us now, or are we waiting for four wet bridesmaids?
好吧，大概在婚礼前半个小时012---Oh, God! Well, it started about a half-hour before the wedding.
我在礼物间里012---I was in this room with all the presents...
看着那个肉汁壶012---...and I was looking at this gravy boat.
那是个非常好看的肉汁壶012---This really gorgeous Limoges gravy boat.
然后，突然…　有代糖吗？012---When all of a sudden... Sweet 'N Low?
我发现…012---- I realized...
我对这个肉汁壶 比对巴瑞更有冲动！012---...I was more turned on by this gravy boat than by Barry.
然后我吓呆了 然后这个想法突然出现在脑中：012---Then I got really freaked out, and that's when it hit me:
巴瑞看起来多像洋芋头先生啊012---How much Barry looks like Mr. Potato Head.
我总是觉得他眼熟，但是…012---You know, I mean, I always knew he looked familiar, but...
总之 我必须离开那里，我在想：012---Anyway, I just had to get out of there, and I started wondering:
〝我为什么这样做，我为谁这样做？〞012---"Why am I doing this?" And "Who am I doing this for?"
我不知道该去哪里 而且我知道我和你有点疏远了012---Anyway, I just didn't know where to go, and I know you and I have drifted apart...
但你是我这个城市里唯一认识的人012---...but you're the only person I know in the city.
而且没有受邀参加你的婚礼012---Who wasn't invited to the wedding.
噢，我希望你不会把它当一回事…012---Oh, I was kind of hoping that wouldn't be an issue.
我猜他给她买了个管风琴012---I'm guessing he bought her the big pipe organ...
而她很不喜欢那个012---...and she's really not happy about it.
老爸，我就是无法和他结婚012---Daddy, I just... I can't marry him.
对不起012---I'm sorry.
我只是不爱他了012---I just don't love him.
这对我很有关系！012---Well, it matters to me.
她真不应该穿那条裤子012---CHANDLER: She should not be wearing those pants.
我觉得应该把她推下楼012---I say push her down the stairs.
把她推下楼…012---ALL: Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs!
爸爸，听我说！012---Come on, Daddy, listen to me!
这就好像在我一生中 所有人都告诉我：〝你是鞋子！〞012---It's like all of my life, everyone's always told me, "You're a shoe!
〝你是鞋子…〞012---You're a shoe! You're a shoe! You're a shoe!"
然后今天，我停下来对自己说： 〝如果我不想成为鞋子呢？012---Then today I stopped and said, "What if I don't wanna be a shoe?
如果我想成为一个包包？012---What if I wanna be a purse? You know?
或一顶帽子？〞012---Or a hat?"
不，我不是要你给我买帽子 我是说我是帽子012---I don't want you to buy me a hat, I am a hat.
这是个比喻，爸爸！012---It's a metaphor, Daddy!
你看得出他哪里听不懂012---You can see where he'd have trouble.
爸爸，这是我的生活012---Look, Daddy, it's my life.
也许我可以和摩妮卡住在一起012---Well, maybe I'll just stay here with Monica.
我猜我们已经确定 她要和摩妮卡住在一起了…012---I guess we've established she's staying with Monica.
也许那是我的决定012---Well, maybe that's my decision.
也许我不需要你的钱012---Well, maybe I don't need your money.
等等！我说也许！012---Wait! Wait! I said maybe!
呼吸，呼吸 好，就这样012---Okay. Just breathe, that's it.
试着想一些让你镇定的事…012---Just try to think of nice, calm things.
玫瑰上的雨滴，还有猫的胡须012---Raindrops on roses And whiskers on kittens
门铃和雪橇铃，还有手套…012---Doorbells and sleigh bells And something with mittens
啦啦啦，还有一些条状物…012---La la la something With string
我现在好多了012---I'm all better now.
我帮上忙啦012---I helped.
瞧，这也许对你来讲是最好的 知道吗？012---MONICA: Look, this is probably for the best, you know?
独立了，把握自己的生活012---Independence. Taking control of your life.
还有，你还需要什么 你可以随时来找乔伊012---And, hey, if you need anything, you can always come to Joey.
我和钱德就住在对面 而且他经常不在012---Me and Chandler live right across the hall. And he's away a lot.
乔伊，不要再对她放电了 今天是她结婚的日子！012---Joey, stop hitting on her. It's her wedding day.
怎么啦，难道这还有什么规定吗？012---What? Like there's a rule or something?
请不要再按了 那是很恐怖的声音012---Please don't do that again. It's a horrible sound.
- 我是保罗 - 让他进来！012---PAUL: Uh, it's Paul. - Buzz him in.
- 谁是保罗？ - 保罗，红酒达人，保罗？012---- Who's Paul? - Paul, the wine guy, Paul?
也许012---Maybe.
等等，你今晚的〝不是真正约会〞 是和红酒达人保罗？012---Wait a minute. Your "not a real date" is with Paul, the wine guy?
- 他终于约你出去啦？ - 是的！012---- He finally asked you out? - Yes.
真是个可以写入日记的时刻012---Ooh. This is a "Dear Diary" moment.
瑞秋，等等，我可以取消…012---Rach, wait, I can cancel.
不用 你去吧，我不会有事的！012---Please, no. Go, I'll be fine.
罗斯，你没事吧？ 你希望我留下来吗？012---Ross, are you okay? I mean, do you want me to stay?
能留下就太好了…012---That'd be good.
- 真的？ - 不，去吧！那可是红酒达人保罗耶！012---- Really? - No, go on! It's Paul, the wine guy.
进来，保罗，这是…012---MONICA: Hi, come in. Paul, this is...
大家 各位，这是保罗012---...everybody. Everybody, this is Paul.
保罗！红酒达人！012---JOEY: Paul, the wine guy.
- 红酒达人！ - 我没听清楚你的名字，是保罗吗？012---- Wine guy. - I didn't catch your name. Paul, was it?
- 请坐，两秒钟就好 - 好012---- Okay. Sit down. Two seconds. - Okay.
我刚拔掉四根睫毛不是个好兆头012---Ooh, I just pulled out four eyelashes. That can't be good.
那么瑞秋，你今晚…打算做什么？012---So, Rachel, what are you up to tonight?
我本来应该到阿鲁巴度蜜月012---Well, I was supposed to be headed for Aruba on my honeymoon...
所以，没事做！012---...so, nothing.
对呀，你连蜜月都无法去012---Right. You're not even getting your honeymoon.
不过，阿鲁巴，这个时候？012---God. No, no. Although, Aruba. Heh. This time of year? Eh.
你可以谈论一下…012---Talk about your...
大蜥蜴012---...big lizards.
总之 如果今晚你不想自己一个人的话012---Anyway, if you don't feel like being alone tonight...
乔伊和钱德要过来 帮我组装我的新家具012---...Joey and Chandler are helping me with my furniture.
对，而且我们为此感到兴奋012---Yes, and we're very excited about it.
谢谢了，不过我想今晚 还是留在这里吧012---Actually, thanks, but I'm just gonna hang out here tonight.
- 今天真是漫长的一天 - 是呀，好吧012---- It's been a long day. - Oh, sure. Okay. Sure.
菲比，你要来帮忙吗？012---Hey, Pheebs, you wanna help?
噢，我希望我能，但是我不想012---Oh, I wish I could, but I don't want to.
我应该把支架固定在侧面012---I'm supposed to attach a bracket-y thing to the side things...
用螺纹蜗轮012---...using a bunch of these little worm guys.
我没有支架，没有看到螺纹蜗轮012---I have no bracket-y thing, I see no worm guys whatsoever...
而且我的腿麻了012---...and I cannot feel my legs.
这是什么？012---What's this?
我不知道012---I have no idea.
- 搞定书架了！ - 完工了！012---- Done with the bookcase. - All finished.
这是卡萝最喜欢的啤酒012---This was Carol's favorite beer.
她总是直接从罐子喝，我该知道的012---She always drank it out of the can. I should have known.
罗斯，我来问你一个问题012---Hey. Ross, let me ask you a question.
她得到家具、音响、超赞的电视…012---She got the furniture, the stereo, the good TV.
那你得到了什么？012---What did you get?
你们啊012---You guys.
- 天呀 - 你被耍了012---- Oh, God. Oh, my God. - You got screwed.
- 我的老天！ - 我知道，我真是个笨蛋012---- Oh, my God. - I know, I know. I'm such an idiot.
当她一个礼拜见四、五次牙医 我就该知道了012---I should've caught on when she went to the dentist four and five times a week.
谁的牙齿需要这么干净？012---I mean, how clean can teeth get?
我哥哥正在克服这种事呢 他真是一团糟012---My brother's going through that. He's such a mess.
你是怎么克服的？012---How did you get through it?
他可以试着砸烂她的一些贵重的东西012---He might try accidentally breaking something valuable of hers.
- 比如她的… - 腿？012---- Say her... - Leg?
那样也可以！012---Heh. That's one way of going through it, yeah.
我则是砸了她的手表012---Me, I went for the watch.
你真的砸了她的手表？012---- You actually broke her watch? - Mm.
巴瑞，对不起，对不起012---Barry, I'm sorry. I am so sorry.
我知道你可能认为和那天我对你说 跟你穿袜子做爱有关，但不是的012---You probably think it's about making love with your socks on, but it isn't.
这和我有关，我只是…012---It isn't, it's about me. And I...
嘿，机器又把电话挂断了 不管怎样…012---Hi. Machine cut me off again. Anyway...
知道什么最吓人的吗？ 如果每个人只有一个女人适合他呢？012---You know what's scary? What if there's only one woman for everybody?
我是说 如果你得到一个女人，就这样012---I mean, what if you get one woman, and that's it?
不幸的是，以我的例子来讲 是她…得到一个女人012---Unfortunately, in my case, there was only one woman for her.
你在说什么？ 〝一个女人〞？012---What are you talking about? One woman.
那就好像你只吃一种口味的冰淇淋012---That's like saying there's only one flavor of ice cream for you.
让我告诉你，罗斯 还有很多种口味012---Let me tell you something, Ross. There's lots of flavors out there.
有碎糖口味、饼干口味 然后还有香草口味012---There's rocky road and cookie dough and bing cherry vanilla.
还可以加糖条、果仁 或者鲜奶油一起吃！012---You can get them with jimmies or nuts or whipped cream.
这是你一生中最棒的时刻了！012---This is the best thing that ever happened to you.
你难道是八岁结婚的？012---You got married. You were like, what, 8?
欢迎回到现实里！拿起汤匙！012---Welcome back to the world. Grab a spoon.
我真不知道我是饿了 还是饥渴012---I honestly don't know if I'm hungry or horny.
离我的冰箱远点！012---Then stay out of my freezer.
从她离开我之后，我…012---Ever since she walked out on me, I...
怎么啦？012---What? What?
你想边吃面条边讲出来？012---You wanna spell it out with noodles?
不，这本该在和你 第五次约会时才能说出来的012---No, it's more of a fifth date kind of revelation.
噢，所以会有第五次约会罗？012---Oh, so there's gonna be a fifth date?
会有吗？012---Isn't there?
我觉得会有012---Yeah, yeah. I think there is.
你要说什么？012---What were you gonna say?
好吧012---Well... Er, uh...
自从她离开我之后…012---Ever since she left me, um...
我就一直…012---...I haven't been able to perform...
无法行房012---...sexually.
天啊，对不起012---Oh, God! Oh, God! I am so...
- 对不起… - 没关系012---- I'm so sorry. - It's okay.
被人吐水应该不是你现在需要的012---Being spit on is probably not what you need right now.
唔…012---Um...
多久了？012---How long?
两年012---Two years.
哇！012---Wow!
我真高兴你砸了她的手表！012---I'm glad you smashed her watch.
那你还希望有第五次约会吗？012---So you still think you might want that fifth date?
是的012---Yeah.
是的，我希望012---Yeah, I do.
我乔安妮接受查理斯为我的合法丈夫012---I, Joanie, take you, Charles, as my lawful husband.
- 你是否接受乔安妮… - 看吧012---MINISTER: Do you take Joanie...? - Oh! See.
可是乔安妮爱佳奇！就是这里不同！012---But Joanie loved Chachi. That's the difference.
〝拿起汤匙〞012---"Grab a spoon."
你知道我多久没拿汤匙了吗？012---Do you know long it's been since I grabbed a spoon?
〝比利，别逞英雄〞 这句话对你有没有意义？012---Do the words, "Billy, don't be a hero," mean anything to you?
是这样的，就算我想…012---You know, here's the thing. Even if I could get it together enough...
约一个女人出来012---...to ask a woman out...
我该约谁？012---...who am I gonna ask?
是不是很不可思议？012---Isn't this amazing?
我以前从来没泡过咖啡012---I mean, I have never made coffee before in my life.
- 是很不可思议 - 恭喜你012---- That is amazing. - Congratulations.
你现在刚好有心情 有没有想做个蛋饼之类的东西…012---While you're on a roll, if you feel like you gotta make a Western omelet or something...
不过我还不太饿…012---Although, actually I'm really not that hungry this morning.
- 早安 - 早安012---- Good morning. MONICA: Good morning.
- 早安  - 早安012---- Morning.  - JOEY: Morning.
- 早安 - 早安，保罗012---- Morning. JOEY: Morning, Paul.

我昨晚很开心012---MONICA: I had a really great time last night.
谢谢你!太感谢你了!012---PAUL: Thank you. Thank you so much.
- 再聊 - 好的012---- We'll talk later, okay? - Yeah.
谢谢012---Thank you.
那不是真正的约会！012---That wasn't a real date.
那你真正的约会都在干什么？012---What the hell do you do on a real date?
- 闭嘴，把我的桌子搬回去 - 好的！012---- Shut up and put my table back. JOEY: Okay.
好啦，孩子们，我要去工作啦012---All right, kids, I gotta get to work.
不过如果我不把那些数字输入 也不会有什么差别012---If I don't input those numbers, it doesn't make much of a difference.
你们都有工作吗？012---So, like, you guys all have jobs?
对，我们都有012---Yeah, we all have jobs.
这样我们才有钱买东西012---See, that's how we buy stuff.
对，我是演员012---Yeah, I'm an actor.
哇，我有见过你的作品吗？012---Wow. Would I have seen you in anything?
哦，应该没有，大部分是地方性节目012---Oh, I doubt it. Mostly regional work.
等等，除非你看过 翻拍的《木偶奇遇记》012---Unless you happened to catch the Wee One's production of Pinocchio.
〝瞧，老木匠，我是个真正的小男孩〞012---"Look, Geppeto. I'm a real live boy."
别这样羞辱我012---I will not take this abuse.
没错，对不起012---You're right. I'm sorry.
我曾经是个小木偶…012---Once I was a wooden boy A little wooden boy
你今天怎么样？睡得好吗？012---MONICA: So how are you doing today? Did you sleep okay?
和巴瑞谈过吗?我无法停止微笑012---Did you talk to Barry? I can't stop smiling.
看得出来，就好像你睡觉时 有个衣架在你嘴里012---I can see that. You look like you slept with a hanger in your mouth.
我知道，他只是太…012---I know. He's just so...
你还记得你和托尼多马哥吗？012---Remember you and Tony De Marco?
- 是的，记得 - 就好像那样，但有感觉012---- Oh, yeah. - Well, it's like that. With feelings.
哇，你有麻烦了012---Oh, wow, are you in trouble!
好，我要醒过来，去工作012---Okay, okay. I am just going to get up, go to work...
而且不要整天想着他012---...and not think about him all day.
或者只是站起来去工作012---Or else I'm just gonna get up and go to work.
- 喔，祝我好运！ - 为什么？012---- Oh, wish me luck! - What for?
我要去找工作之类的事012---I'm gonna go get one of those job things.
嘿，摩妮卡！ 嘿，弗兰妮，欢迎回来！012---- Hey, Monica. - Hey, Franny. Welcome back.
佛罗里达怎么样？012---How was Florida?
你跟人上床了，对吧？012---You had sex, didn't you?
你怎么知道的012---How do you do that?
- 那么，是和谁？ - 你认识保罗吗？012---- So, who? - You know Paul?
保罗，红酒达人？012---Paul, the wine guy?
是的，我认识保罗012---Oh, yeah, I know Paul.
你认识他就好像我认识他一样？012---You mean, you know Paul like I know Paul?
你开玩笑吧？保罗还欠我人情呢012---Are you kidding? I take credit for Paul.
在我之前，他两年都无法行房012---Before me, there was no snap in his turtle for two years.
那当然是谎言！012---Of course it was a line.
为什么？为什么有人会做这样的事情？012---Why? Why would anybody do something like that?
我想更精确的答案是012---We're looking for an answer more sophisticated than:
〝为了和你上床〞012---"To get you into bed."
是因为我吗？012---Is it me?
是因为我会散发某种信号吗？012---Is it like I have some sort of beacon that only dogs...
只有狗和有感情问题的男人 才会成应到？012---...and men with severe emotional problems can hear?
好啦，过来这里，把你的脚给我012---All right, come here. Give me your feet.
我只是以为他是个好人012---I just thought he was nice, you know?
我真不敢相信 你不知道那是谎言！012---I can't believe you didn't know it was a line.
猜猜怎么样？012---Guess what.
- 你找到工作啦？ - 开玩笑吗？012---- You got a job? - Are you kidding?
我一点经验都没有！012---I'm trained for nothing.
我今天被十二个面试员嘲笑012---I was laughed out of 12 interviews today.
而且你还这么高兴012---Yet you're surprisingly upbeat.
你也会高兴的 如果你发现名牌皮靴特价…012---Well, you would be too if you found Joan and David boots on sale...
打五折！012---...50 percent off.
