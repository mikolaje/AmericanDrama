你们有事情想跟大家分享吗012---Is it something that you'd like to share with the group?
没有，没事012---No. No, that's okay.
你们有事情如此重要 非得在我弹奏时讨论…012---Come on, if it's important enough to discuss while I'm playing...

然后你就开始大吼了012---Then that's when you started yelling.
好，我们休息片刻012---Okay, we're gonna take a short break.
那家伙带回家的 应该不只是教训而已012---I think that guy's going home with more than a note.
过来，．马塞尔，坐着012---ROSS: Come here, Marcel. Sit here.
菲比，我不敢相信 他还没亲你012---Pheebs, I can't believe he hasn't kissed you yet.
我跟巴洛约会六次后…012---I mean, God, by my sixth date with Paolo...
他已经替我的胸部取小名了012---...I mean, he had already named both my breasts.

他不会伤害它们 不是吗012---Look, he's not gonna hurt them, right?
你一定要把他 带来这里吗012---Do you always have to bring him here?
我不想把他单独留在家012---Look, I didn't want to leave him alone, all right?
我们今早吵了第一次架012---We had our first fight this morning.
我觉得是因为我加班的关系 我说了不该说的话012---I think it has to do with my working late. I said some things that I didn't mean.
他就朝我扔一坨屎012---He threw some feces.
如果你加班 我可以替你照顾他012---You know, if you're gonna work late, I can look in on him for you.
太好了，好…012---Oh, that would be great. Okay.
如果你去，一定要假装 你是去找他012---But if you do, make sure it seems like you're there to see him, okay?
而不是帮我忙012---And you're not, like, doing it as a favor to me.
好，但是他如果问 我就要直话直说了012---Okay. But if he asks, I'm not going to lie.
但我们仍无法测试这个理论012---But you can't actually test this theory.
因为现今粒子加速器的速度…012---Because today's particle accelerators are nowhere near powerful enough...

- 好，那我有个问题 - 请说012---- Okay. All right. I have a question then. - Yeah.
你有打算要亲我吗012---Were you planning on kissing me ever?

有012---...would be yes.
我有这个打算012---Yes, I was.
但我要这非凡的吻…012---But see, I wanted it to be this phenomenal kiss...
发生在非凡的时刻 因为是要亲你012---...that happened at this phenomenal moment because, well, it's you.
当然  耶012---Sure. Yeah.
对，但是我等得愈久 这个亲吻得更加非凡012---Right. But, see, the longer I waited, the more phenomenal the kiss had to be.
现在，已经变成…012---And now, we've reached a place...
我得…012---...where it's just got to be one of those things where I...
把桌子的东西都扫光 把你丢上去012---...sweep everything off the table and throw you down on it.
而我并不是那样的人012---And I'm not really a sweeping sort of fella.
大卫，我认为你正是那样的人012---Oh, David, I think you are a sweeping sort of fella.
只是你困在物理学家的体内罢了012---I mean, you're a sweeper trapped inside a physicist's body.
- 是吗 - 没错 我很肯定012---- Really. - Oh, yeah. I'm sure of it.

- 你现在比较像在打扫 - 好吧，管他的012---- So now you're just kind of tidying up. - Okay, what the hell? What the hell?
- 你要我把你丢上去还是你自己跳  - 我可以跳012---- You want me to actually throw you...? - I can hop.
告诉我，〝没有约会的约定〞 对你们的意义为何012---Now, tell me something, what does the phase "no-date pact" mean to you?
我真的很抱歉，好吗？012---Look, I'm sorry, okay?
只是钱德约了人 菲比也约了人012---It's just that Chandler has somebody and Phoebe has somebody.
我就想说问问好笑巴比012---I thought I'd ask Fun Bobby.

别这样，我们会办个大派对 没有人会知道谁的伴是谁012---Oh, come on. We'll have a big party, and no one will know who's with who.
我现在真的不需要应付这些012---Hey, you know, this is so not what I needed now.
- 怎么了 - 噢，是马塞尔012---- What's the matter? - Oh, it's Marcel.
他一直拒我于门外012---He keeps shutting me out, you know?
老是拖着双手，走来走去012---He's walking around all the time, dragging his hands.
太奇怪了，我前几晚 跟他玩得很开心012---That's so weird. I had such a blast with him the other night.
