对，因为我上个室友基普…012---Yes, it's just that, with my last roommate...
基普的事我全知道012---Oh, I know all about Kip.
我们合买了日式小炭炉012---We bought a hibachi together,
后来他结婚搬出去012---and then he ran off and got married...
我们闹得很不愉快012---...and things got pretty ugly.
我问你012---So let me ask you something.
基普是个比我好的室友吗？012---Was Kip a better roommate than me?
求你别问012---Oh, don't do that.

有些人喜欢脱衣…裸体012---I mean, some people prefer, you know, to take off...
喔！裸体012---Ooh, oops! Being naked.
我无法想像你不愿知道012---I can't believe you don't want to know.

行012---Fine.
鸟呢012---What about the birds?
我不知道  鸟不会说：012---I don't know. Birds just don't say:
哈罗，坐这儿，吃点东西012---"Hello, sit here. Eat something."
你挑一张吧012---You pick one.
好，瓢虫呢012---How about the ladybugs?
抛下鸟不管，只因红色昆虫 可以增加食欲？012---Oh, so forget about the birds, but big red insects suggest fine dining?
行，你想买鸟，就买鸟吧012---Fine. Do you want the birds? Get the birds.
别以为我不会012---Not like that, I won't.

天啊012---Mm, my God.
我怎么没吃过012---Why have I never tasted these before?
我并不常做012---Oh, I don't make them a lot...
因为这样 对其他饼干太不公平了012---...because I don't think it's fair to the other cookies.
嗯，老天012---Ahem, God.
你说得对，这是我吃过 最好吃的燕麦葡萄干饼干012---Well, you're right. These are the best oatmeal-raisin cookies I've ever had.
- 这证明我绝不说谎 - 没错012---- Which proves that I never lie. - I guess you don't.

那，你认为如何012---So, what do you think?
这是我见过最漂亮的桌子012---I think it's the most beautiful table I've ever seen.
我知道012---I know.
怎么用？012---So how does this work?
打算用这些小头平衡盘子012---Gonna balance the plates on these little heads?
谁在乎 我们在水槽吃 来吧012---Who cares? We'll eat at the sink. Come on.
加油，罗斯012---Heads up, Ross.

我觉得自己好愚蠢012---Ugh! I feel so stupid.
我想起前几天和你们在一起时012---I think about the other day, with you guys, you know.
我总是说：“保罗，他好棒012---And I was all, "Oh, Paolo. He's so great.
他让我好…” 噢！012---He makes me feel so..." Ugh!
天012---God.
真是丢人012---I'm so embarrassed.
我也觉得丢人012---I'm so embarrassed.
他的目标是我012---I'm the one he hit on.
菲比，都是我造成的 如果我不认识他012---I unleashed him on you. If I'd never met him...
你就不会发生这种事012---...this would've never happened.
- 对不起 - 不，对不起…012---- I'm so sorry. - No, I'm sorry.
对不起012---BOTH: No, I'm sorry.
等等012---Oh, wait. Oh.
- 我们在抱歉什么？ - 我也不知道012---- What are we sorry about? - I don't know.
对，他是一条猪012---Right. He's the pig.
- 大色猪 - 他是一头大色猪012---- Such a pig. - Oh, God, he's such a pig.

为何我之前没感觉到012---How did I not see this?
我知道了012---Oh, I know!
因为…012---Because...
他是个迷死人的012---...he's gorgeous.
大帅哥012---And he's charming.

我不该告诉你吗012---Should I not have told you?
不，相信我 还是让我知道比较好012---No, trust me, it's much better that I know.
但我比较喜欢从前 从前比较好012---Uh, I just liked it better before. It was better.
我想她已坦然接受012---I think she took it pretty well.
保罗在那儿012---You know, Paolo's over there right now, so...
我们该过去看她的情况如何012---Yeah, we should get over there and see if she's okay.
等等012---Just one second.
- 喔，得分 - 我们赢了012---- Whoo! Score. - Game. Us.
是啊012---Yes.
走吧，菲比012---Come on, Pheebs.
呼012---Whoo.
看来我们痛宰你们了012---Well, it looks like, uh, we kicked your butts.
才怪，是她痛宰我们012---No, no. She kicked our butts.
你只能算是观众012---You could be on the Olympic "Standing There" team.
来嘛，两个对一个012---Come on. Two on one.
你为何还待在这儿？ 她刚和人分手012---What are you still doing here? She just broke up with the guy.
现在正是你趁虚而入的时候012---It's time for you to swoop in.
什么？现在？012---What? Now?
没错，现在趁虚而入012---Yes. Now is when you swoop.
你得成为保罗走后012---You gotta make sure that when Paolo walks out...
瑞秋看见的第一个男人012---...the first guy Rachel sees is you.
她必须知道你拥有 他没有的一切012---She's got to know that you're everything he's not.
就像“反保罗”一样012---You're like... Like the anti-Paolo.
我这位天主教朋友说得没错012---My Catholic friend is right.
她伤心欲绝时 你在她身旁守候着012---She's distraught. You're there for her.
收拾残局 然后堂堂迈入012---You pick up the pieces, and then you usher in:
“罗斯年代”012---The Age of Ross.
等等…012---RACHEL: See this? See?
- 怎么了？ - 别看012---- How's it going? MONICA: Don't stare.
她刚把衣服倒完012---She just finished throwing his clothes off the balcony.
现在只剩“短兵相接”012---Now there's just a lot of gesturing and arm-waving.
这是代表“你竟敢” 或是“波霸”012---Okay, that is either, "How could you?" Or "Enormous breasts."
他进来了012---Here he comes.
我是…012---Uh, I am, uh...
…来道别的012---...to say goodbye.
再见012---Oh, okay, bye-bye.
保罗012---Paolo.
我痛恨你背叛瑞秋 但我还有五份012---I really hate you for what you did to Rachel. But I still have five of these...
所以以375度加热 直到起司冒泡012---...so heat it at 375 until the cheese bubbles.
谢谢012---Thanks
保罗，我只想告诉…012---Paolo, I just wanna tell you...
我代表大家发言…012---...and I think I'd speak for everyone when I say...
你们看她012---PHOEBE: Oh. Just look at her.
各位，我认为一个人…012---Oh, you guys, I really think only one of us should go out there...
…应该出去安慰她 - 你说的对012---...so she's not overwhelmed. - Oh, right.
而且那个人就是我012---And I really think it should be me.
嘿012---BOTH: Hey.
你还好吧012---You all right?
好多了012---Oh. I've been better.
过来012---Come here.
听着012---Listen...
你应得到更好的对象012---...you deserve so much better than him.
懂吗  我是说，一个…012---You know? I mean, you...
懂得珍惜你的人在一起012---You should be with a guy who knows what he has when he has you.
罗斯012---Ross...
什么？012---What?
我已对男生感到厌烦012---I'm so sick of guys.
我不要再看到男生了012---I don't want to look at another guy.
不要再想男生012---I don't want to think about another guy.
