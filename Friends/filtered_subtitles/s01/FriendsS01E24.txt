忘了她吧012---Forget about her.
他说得对，你要忘了她，快点去中国吧 去吃些好吃的中国菜012---He's right, man. Please move on. Go to China. Eat Chinese food.
当然中国人不会说 自己吃的是〝中国菜〞012---Of course, there they just call it food.
大概吧，我不知道012---Yeah? I guess. I don't know.
好吧，那就帮我 把这个交给她，好吗？012---All right, just give her this for me, okay?
老兄，我们是为了你好012---Listen, we're just looking out for you.

我觉得你是个好人012---I just think you're nice.
我们是那时候开始 经营水果篮生意的012---Anyway, that's when me and my friends started this fruit-basket business.
我们称自己为 〝篮子三剑客〞012---We call ourselves "The Three Basketeers." Ha, ha.

那本书伴我度过 许多艰困的日子012---That book got me through some tough times.
这男人心中住着一个小孩012---There is a little child inside this man.

我跟他说这枚胸针 跟我小时候奶奶的胸针很像012---I told him it was just like one my grandmother had when I was little.
真不敢相信 他竟然还记得012---Aw! I can't believe he remembered!
可是你能在飞机上玩那个吗012---Well, sure, but can you play it on a plane?
好美喔！012---Oh, it's so pretty.
- 定花了他很多钱 - 真是不敢相信012---- This must've cost him a fortune. - I can't believe he did this.
你们记得上大学时 罗斯爱上卡萝…012---Ross? Remember when he fell in love with Carol...

你刚说什么012---What did you just say?
水晶鸭012---Crystal duck.

我们的生活从此面临巨大转变012---Uh-uh. I don't think any of our lives will ever be the same ever again.
想办法让这女人闭嘴好吗012---Is there a mute button on this woman?
我觉得这样很棒 你跟罗斯在一起很棒！012---I think this is so great! I mean, you and Ross!
- 你之前知道吗  - 不知道012---- Did you have any idea? - No, none.
我到纽约的第一个晚上 他说过要约我出去…012---My first night in the city, he mentioned asking me out...
可是一直都没有发生 所以我以为…012---...but nothing ever happened, so I just...
他还说了什么 他有说想跟我约会吗012---What else did he say? Does he want to go out with me?
他既然那么爱你…012---Given that he's desperately in love with you...
应该不介意跟你喝杯咖啡吧012---...he wouldn't mind getting a cup of coffee or something.
罗斯012---Ross?
他一直都喜欢我012---All this time?
- 我得去找他谈谈  - 他人在中国（亦指瓷器）啊012---- I've gotta talk to him. - He's in China!

瑞秋，你要对他说什么012---What are you gonna say to him?
我不知道012---I don't know.
那你就不该去012---Maybe you shouldn't go.
对 如果你是去伤他的心 那就不用急于一时012---Right, because if you're gonna break his heart, that can wait.
对 但如果是好消息 那就马上去告诉他012---Yeah, but if it's good news, tell him now.
搞不好等我看到他就会知道012---Maybe I'll know when I see him.
好吧，这样有帮助吗012---Here, look. All right, does this help?
没有012---No.
我只知道我等不了一个礼拜 这件事太让人震撼了012---All I know is, I cannot wait a week. This is just too big.

抱歉 没有登机证就无法进去012---Sorry, you're not allowed on the jetway unless you have a boarding pass.
我知道 他刚进去 就在那里 穿蓝色外套的那个 我可以…012---He just went on. He's right there, in the blue jacket! Can I just...?
抱歉，这是联邦法律规定！012---I'm sorry. Federal regulations!
好，那你可以帮我传话吗012---All right, um, then could you please just give him a message for me?
拜托，我有重要的事跟他说012---Please? This is very important.
好吧，你想说什么？012---All right. What's the message?

不要跟我冷战012---Don't give me that deep freeze!
噢，乔伊、乔伊、乔伊！012---Oh, Joey, Joey, Joey!
我想我刚失去了知觉012---I think I blacked out there for a minute.
这不算什么啦012---It was nothing.
现在换你享受罗012---Well, now we gotta find something fun for you!
等等012---Ahh, you know what?
别管我了 你再来一次吧012---Forget about me. Let's, uh... Let's give you another turn.
我再一次012---Me, again?
有何不可012---Sure. Why not?
哇，有人明天 会拿到一个超大的水果篮！012---Boy! Somebody's gonna get a big fruit basket tomorrow!
我得说，乔伊 你跟我想像中的完全不一样012---I gotta tell you, you are nothing like I thought you would be.
什么意思？012---How do you mean?
我以为你是 凡事只想到自己的男人012---I just had you pegged as one of those guys who are always, "Me, me, me!"
- 哈哈 - 可是你012---- Ha, ha. - But you...
竟然这么替别人着想012---...you're a giver.
你是我碰过最大方体贴的男人012---You're, like, the most generous man I ever met.
你根本就是个女人012---I mean, you're practically a woman.
瑞秋 你要把包装纸留起来吗012---So, uh, Rach, do you want to save this wrapping paper?
只有点破012---It's only a little torn.
你想跟罗斯在一起吗 还是我该把这东西给丢了012---Are you gonna go for it with Ross, or should I throw it out?
我不知道、我不知道012---I don't know.
我去的时候一直在想…012---Thought about it all of the way there...
回来的时候也一直想…012---...and I thought about it all the way back and, uh...
竟然是罗斯012---You know, it's Ross!
你们知道我的意思吗 我跟罗斯耶012---You know what I mean? It's Ross.
- 是啊！ - 是啊012---- Sure! - Sure.
我不知道 我的直觉告诉我…012---I don't know. This is just my initial gut feeling...
我想012---...but I'm thinking...
这样应该会很棒012---...it'd be really great.
天啊，我也这样觉得耶！ 我们会变成朋友兼亲家！012---Oh, my God, me too! Oh, we'd be like friends-in-law!
最棒的是 你对他已经很了解012---The best part is you already know everything about him.
感觉就像第十五次约会012---It's like starting on the 15th date.
对啊，一开始就像 已经约会十五次了一样012---But it would be like starting on the 15th date.
说的好012---Another good point.
我的意思是…012---No, I mean...
通常约会到第十五次 双方就应该已经在交往012---At the 15th date, you're already in a "relationship-y" place.
确定要在一起了012---You're committed.
呵012---Huh.
如果事情不成怎么办？012---What happens if it doesn't work out?
- 为什么会不成？ - 不知道，有时候就是会这样012---- Why isn't it working out? - I don't know, sometimes it doesn't.
他不够帅吗？ 还是赚的钱不够多？012---Is he not cute enough for you? Does he not make enough money?
- 不是啦，我只是… - 也许她有别的对象012---- No, I'm just... - Maybe there's someone else.
是吗？你还有别的对象吗？012---Is there? Is there someone else?
- 没有啊，没有别人 - 那你干嘛012---- No, there is no one else. - Then why the hell...
甩掉我哥？  - 什么？012---...are you dumping my brother?  - Wha...?
- 嘿，大… - 嘘！012---- Hey, big... - Shh!
慈善家012---Spender.
她还在睡觉012---She's still asleep.
- 结果怎样？ - 太神奇了012---- So how'd it go? - It was amazing.
你知道那种自认很行的感觉吗？012---You know how you think you're great in bed?
你会问我那种问题 就代表你根本不了解我012---The fact you'd even ask shows how little you know me.
昨晚我没办法表现012---Well, it's like, last night I couldn't do the thing...
拿手的技巧012---...that usually makes me great.
所以我只好想别的办法012---So I had to do all this other stuff.
结果我得到的回应超赞的！ 老兄，不是我想自夸！012---And the response I got! Man, oh, man.
好像去参加碎纸花游行一样开心012---It was like a ticker-tape parade!
我知道，我房间 离游行路线非常非常近012---Yes I know. As it happens, my room is very close to the parade route.
那种感觉真的很棒，不只是她 我也觉得超赞的012---It was amazing, and not just for her. Uh-uh. For me too.
那种感觉就像是 我突然间看不见了…012---It's like, all of a sudden, I'm blind...
可是其他的感官却都变敏锐012---...but all my other senses are heightened.
我好像可以体会到…012---You know? It's like, I was able to appreciate it...
另一种层次的喜悦012---...on another level.
我不知道你还有层次可言012---I didn't know you had another level.
对啊，我之前也不知道！012---I know. Neither did I!
哇，这件裙子真漂亮 是你的生日礼物吗？012---- Hey, great skirts! Birthday present? - Yeah.
- 谁送的？ - 你送的012---- From who? - From you.
我把你送的衬衫拿去换了012---I exchanged the blouse you got me.
心意最重要012---Well, it's the thought.
罗斯的班机不是快到了吗？012---Doesn't Ross' flight get in in a couple hours?
我记得是在登机门二十七B012---At gate 27B?
对012---Uh, yeah.
摩妮卡，我想了很久012---Monica, you know, I've been thinking about it.
我觉得我不该跟罗斯在一起012---I've decided this Ross thing is not a good idea.
- 为什么？ - 因为我会觉得012---- Why? - Because I feel...
我不只是在跟他交往012---...like I wouldn't just be going out with him.
你们大家都会变成我约会的对象012---I would be going out with all of you.
- 我会有压力… - 没有压力、没有压力的！012---- Ugh, there'd be all this pressure and... - No pressure, no pressure!
摩妮卡，我们八字都还没一撇 你就已经这么…012---Nothing has even happened yet and you're already so...
我哪有！好吧012---I'm not "so."
一开始我是觉得有点怪…012---I was a teensy bit weird at first...
可是我发誓不会给你们压力012---...but I'll be good. I promise.
是谁？012---Who is it?
是我，卡尔012---CARL: It's me, Carl.
上来吧012---Come on up.
你背着我哥偷吃？012---Behind my brother's back?
像这种话 我绝不可能会对你说的012---Is the kind of crazy thing you won't be hearing from me.
- 七百块！ - 太棒了！你办到了！012---- Seven hundred bucks. - All right, you did it.
家里有水果吗？012---Do we have any fruit?
真是可怕的两个礼拜012---Man, hell of a two weeks, huh?
你知道吗？ 我觉得我从中学到很多012---You know what, though? I really feel I learned something.
你还要继续 〝凡事以她为主〞吗？012---So you'll stick with this "it's all for her" thing?
你疯了吗？012---What, are you crazy?
- 个盲人恢复视觉之后 还会这样走路吗？012---When a blind man gets his sight back, does he walk around like this?
我只是说 如果再让我看到…012---I'm just saying, if I see one more picture of Ed Begley Jr...
艾德贝格利在电动车里的照片012---...in that stupid electric car...
我就会自杀！012---...I'm gonna shoot myself!
我并不是反对环保…012---Don't get me wrong. I'm not against environmental issues, per se...
我只是讨厌那个家伙！012---...it's just that guy!
没想到你竟然宁愿跟他出去 而不是我012---I can't believe you'd rather go out with him than me.
抱歉，我正在约会耶012---Excuse me, please. I'm trying to have a date here.
好，那就停止想我啊012---Fine, just stop thinking about me.
做不到是吧？012---Can't do it, can you?
我是在想你，那又怎样？012---So I'm thinking about you. So what?
