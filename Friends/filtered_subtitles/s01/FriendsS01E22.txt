在真正开始过夜之前…012---Uh, before we get into any staying-over stuff...
有些事要先让你知道012---...there's something you should know.
好，是类似 〝我明天早上有一堂很早的课〞的事…012---Okay. Is this like "I have an early class tomorrow"...
还是〝我已经跟一头山羊秘婚了〞？012---...or "I'm secretly married to a goat"?
介于两者之间012---Well, it's somewhere in between.
严格来说，我不算是…012---You see, in a strictly technical sense, of course, I'm not, uh...
