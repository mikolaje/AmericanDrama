还没生出来的宝宝012---The baby that hasn't been born yet?
这是否代表你…012---Uh, wouldn't that mean you're...
疯了？012---...crazy?
你不相信他们在里面 听得到声音？012---What, you don't think they can hear sounds in there?
你不是认真的吧  你真的跟胎儿说话012---You're not serious. I mean, you really talk to it?
对，常常 我要宝宝认得我的声音012---Yeah, all the time. I want the baby to know my voice.
那你… 你有提到我吗012---Do you, uh...? Do you talk about me?
有，常提 真的？012---- Yeah, yeah. All the time. - Really?
不过，我们都是称你为 〝捐精子的泡泡先生〞012---But, um, we just refer to you as "Bobo the sperm guy."
如果她有对胎儿说话，我想 我也要争取一点肚皮时间012---Look, if she's talking to it, I just think I should get some belly time too.
并非我相信这一套012---I mean, not that I believe any of this.
我信，我想宝宝可以听到 所有的声音012---Oh, I believe it. I think the baby can totally hear everything.
- 真的？ - 我可以证明给你看012---- Really? - I can show you.
也许有点怪012---This will seem a little weird.
不过只要你把头 放到这只火鸡里面012---But you put your head inside this turkey...
然后我们大家都来说话 你就可以听到我们说的话012---...and then we'll all talk, and you'll hear everything we say.
我想表达 我对这项实验的支持012---I'd just like to say I'm totally behind this experiment.

我嘴里…我记得的很清楚 还塞满南瓜派012---I have... And I remember this part vividly. - A mouthful of pumpkin pie.
然后我父母就告诉我 他们要离婚了012---And this is the moment my parents choose to tell me they're getting divorced.
哦，我的天！012---Oh, my God.
一旦你尝过完全相反的滋味 就很难去享受感恩节大餐012---It's very difficult to enjoy Thanksgiving dinner once you've seen it in reverse.

我还以为我们要弄成泥 然后再加进一些豆子和洋葱012---I thought we could have them whipped and then add some peas and onions.
为什么要加？012---Why would we do that?
因为我妈死前012---Then they'd be just like my mom used to make it...

马铃薯毁了、马铃薯毁了 马铃薯毁了012---Potatoes are ruined. Potatoes are ruined. Potatoes are ruined.
我来喽012---Here we come
走在…012---Walkin' down the...
这味道不像妈的厨房012---This doesn't smell like Mom's.
是不像，对吧？你要有颗粒的？012---No, it doesn't, does it? But you wanted lumps, Ross?
给你，兄弟，这就是你的颗粒012---Well, here you go, buddy. You got one.
天，这下可好012---Oh, God, this is great.
飞机跑了 我想我只好跟你们卡在这里了012---The plane is gone, so I guess I'm stuck here with you guys.
嘿，我们都有较好的计划 这又不是大家的首选012---Hey, we all had better plans, okay? This was nobody's first choice.
哦，真的吗？012---Oh, really?
那我干嘛忙得要死012---So why was I busting my ass...
想弄出一顿美味的大餐？012---...to make this delicious Thanksgiving dinner?!
- 这叫美味吗？ - 给我闭嘴！012---- You call that delicious? - You be quiet!
别吵了，别吵了，别吵了！012---All right, stop it, stop it, stop it!
这样子感觉才像感恩节012---Now, this feels like Thanksgiving.
干嘛？012---PHOEBE: Ew. - What?
丑陋的裸男 从烤箱里把他的火鸡拿出来了012---PHOEBE: Ugly Naked Guy's taking his turkey out of the oven.
哟012---JOEY, ROSS & MONICA: Eh.
哦，我的天，他有人陪012---PHOEBE: Oh, my God. He's not alone.
丑陋的裸男…012---Ugly Naked Guy...
跟丑陋的裸女 共享感恩大餐012---...is having Thanksgiving dinner with Ugly Naked Gal.
这我得瞧瞧012---JOEY: I gotta see this.
喔012---ALL: Aw.
丑陋的裸男，好家伙012---All right, Ugly Naked Guy.
丑陋的裸舞012---Ooh, ugly naked dancing.
他有伴真的很好012---It's nice that he has someone.
我可以开始切了吗？012---Shall I carve?
请便012---By all means.
好012---CHANDLER: All right.
谁要白起司 谁要黑起司的？012---Okay, who wants light cheese and who wants dark cheese?
我根本不想问什么叫黑起司012---I don't even wanna know about the dark cheese.
- 有人要分吃这块吗？ - 我要012---- Does anybody wanna split this with me? - Ooh, I will.
你们得许愿才行012---Mm. You guys have to make a wish.
- 许愿？ - 得了，你们是知道的，就感恩节啊012---- Make a wish? - Come on, you know, Thanksgiving.

举杯了012---- A little toast here. Ding, ding, ding. ALL: Mm.
我知道这也许不是 你们大家想要的感恩节012---This isn't exactly the kind of Thanksgiving you planned...
可是对我来说 今天的感恩节真的很棒012---...but for me this has been really great, you know?
我想这是因为今天没有人离婚012---I think because it didn't involve divorce...
也没有人大吐特吐012---...or projectile vomiting.
如果你去维尔滑雪012---I was just thinking, if you'd gone to Vail...
或你们去跟家人相聚 或者要不是你得到…012---...or if you guys had been with your family, or if you didn't have...
梅毒或什么的012---...syphilis and stuff...
我们就不可能在此相聚012---...we wouldn't be all together, you know?
我想我真正想说的是…012---So I guess what I'm trying to say...
我很感恩 你们大家的感恩节全毁了012---...is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.
太感人了012---RACHEL & JOEY: That's so sweet.
谢谢012---RACHEL: Thank you.
