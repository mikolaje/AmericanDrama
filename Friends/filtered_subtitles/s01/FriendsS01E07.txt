但我不会那么做012---But I won't.
天啊，他第一次对着我笑012---God. The first time he smiled at me...
那三秒钟比我跟巴瑞 在百慕达度过的三星期刺激012---...those three seconds were more exciting than three weeks in Bermuda with Barry.
你们有租摩托车吗？012---Did you rent mopeds?
因为我听说…012---Because I've heard...
那不是现在的重点012---Oh, it's not about that right now. Okay.
我知道这超肤浅的 而且我们没有共通点012---I know it's totally superficial, and we have nothing in common...
连说的语言都不一样012---...and we don't even speak the same language...
但是天啊012---...but, God.
巴洛，嗨012---Paolo, hi.

重点是瑞秋跟我应该…012---The point is that, uh, Rachel and I should be, uh...
