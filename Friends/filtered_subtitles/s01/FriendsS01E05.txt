得了，那没什么大不了的012---Would you let it go? It's not a big deal.
没什么？简直是太神奇了012---ROSS: Not a big deal? It's amazing.
只要把手伸进去弄一弄012---You just reach in, there's one little maneuver, and bam!
一件胸罩 就直接从袖子里出来012---A bra. Right out the sleeve.
据我所知，这种事012---As far as I'm concerned...
男人根本就做不来，对吧？012---...there is nothing a guy can do that comes close. Right?
拜托！你们男人可以站着小便012---Come on! You guys can pee standing up.
我们可以吗？ 好，我会试试012---We can? Okay, I'm trying that.
知道我想到什么了吗？012---You know what blows my mind?
女人随时可以看到胸部012---Women can see breasts anytime they want.
只要往下一看 就在那里012---You just look down, and there they are.
真不懂你们哪有办法 专心做事012---How you get any work done is beyond me.
我知道了…我不懂男人怎能 做出许多残忍的事情…012---What I don't get is the way guys can do so many mean things...
却完全不在乎012---...and then not even care.

约会的日子！ 周六夜，周六夜！012---Date night! Saturday night. Saturday night!
- 你没节目，对吧？ - 一个也没有！012---- No plans, huh? - Not a one.
连跟珍妮丝分手的计划也没有？012---Not even, say, breaking up with Janice?
对，对，闭嘴012---Oh, right, right. Shut up.
钱德，没人喜欢跟别人分手012---Chandler, nobody likes breaking up with someone.
- 只是你非做不可 - 我知道，不过真的很难012---- You just gotta do it. - I know. But it's just so hard.
你就跟她坐在一起 她浑然不觉012---You're sitting with her. She has no idea what's happening.
终于你鼓起勇气 开始行动012---You finally get up the courage to do it.
当你把纸条传给她时 气氛很僵012---There's that awkward moment when you've handed her the note.
你干嘛非得跟她分手不可？012---Why do you have to break up with her?
像个男人，不要再打电话就好了012---Be a man. Just stop calling.
如果你需要的话 我可以跟你一起做012---If you want, I'll do it with you.
谢谢，不过她会觉得 我们在联合起来对付她012---Thanks, but she'd feel like we were ganging up on her.
不，我是说是你甩珍妮丝 我甩东尼012---I mean you break up with Janice. I'll break up with Tony.
你要跟东尼分手？012---You're breaking up with Tony?
他很甜，不过已经不好玩了012---I know. He's sweet, but it's just not fun anymore.
我不晓得原因在于我 或在于他的绝食012---I don't know if it's me or his hunger strike. I don't know.
你们还要点些什么吗？012---Does anybody want anything else?
对了，你们上礼拜有一种有很好吃的 核桃巧克力的蛋糕或派的一种…012---Yeah. Last week you had a wonderful nutty, chocolate-y, kind of cake-y pie thing that...
不用了，我不饿012---Nothing. I'm fine.
怎么了？ 干嘛苦瓜脸？012---What's the matter? Why so scrunchie?
我爸要给我一辆宾士敞篷012---It's my father. He wants to give me a Mercedes convertible.
那家伙，真是令我火大012---That guy, he burns me up.
对，是宾士 只要我搬回家去012---Yeah, well, it's a Mercedes if I move back home.
真讨厌！ 他还叫我〝小姑娘〞012---It was horrible! He called me "young lady."
我爸爸那样叫我时 我也很气012---Ooh, I hate when my father calls me that.
他是否又念些 〝你不可能办到〞之类的？012---Did he give you that whole "You're not up to this" thing again?
我听到的是加长版 有一句不断重复的副歌是…012---Yeah, I got the extended disco version with three choruses of:
〝靠你自己是不可能成功的〞012---"You'll never make it on your own."
哦 噢012---Uh-huh, uh-huh
嘿，乔伊012---Hi, Joey.
哦，我的天！安琪拉！012---Oh, my God. Angela.
哇！被你甩掉 对她显然是好事012---Wow. Being dumped by you obviously agrees with her.
- 你要过去吗？ - 不012---- Are you gonna go over there? - No.
好，不012---Yeah. No.
可以，不过时候未到 我不想显得太饥渴012---Okay, but not yet. I don't wanna seem too eager.
一下下、两下下…012---One Mississippi, two Mississippi...
三下下 这样似乎就很酷了012---...three Mississippi. That seems pretty cool.
嘿，安琪拉012---Hey, Angela.
乔伊012---Joey.
你看起来很性感012---You look good.
那是因为我穿着一件 特别强调胸部的衣服012---Because I'm wearing a dress that accents my boobs.
可不是吗012---You don't say.
那，瑞秋，你晚上有何计划？012---So, Rachel, what are you doing tonight?
晚上可精彩了 我跟摩妮卡要去自助洗衣店012---Big glamour night. Me and Monica at Launderama.
噢012---Oh.
你想听一件诡异的巧合吗？012---You wanna hear a freakish coincidence?
猜猜还有谁也会去？012---Guess who's doing laundry there too?
- 谁 - 我012---- Who? - Me.
这样还不够清楚吗？012---Was that not clear?
何不…？012---Hey, why don't...?
我何不加入你们两个人的行列？012---Why don't I just join you both there?
你住的大楼 不就有一间洗衣室？012---Don't you have a laundry room in your building?
对012---Yes.
我那里有一间洗衣室012---I do have a laundry room in my building.
不过，那里有老鼠出没012---Um... But there's a rat problem.
他们显然对烘干机的芳香片 很有兴趣012---Apparently, they're attracted to the dryer sheets.
他们进去的时候都还好好的 出来的时候就…012---They're going in fine, but they're coming out all...
蓬蓬的了012---...fluffy.
总之，七点左右好吗？012---Anyway, 7-ish?
当然012---Sure.
少来，我现在跟鲍柏在一起了012---Forget it, Joey. I'm with Bob now.
鲍柏？鲍柏是谁？012---Bob? Who the hell's Bob?
鲍柏很棒012---Bob is great.
他很聪明、见过世面 而且有正当工作012---He's smart, he's sophisticated, and he has a real job.
你一个月试镜三次 就说自己是演员，鲍柏则…012---You go on three auditions a month and you call yourself an actor. But Bob...
拜托！我们在一起时很快乐012---Come on. We were great together.
不只是享乐的时候 比如说，谈话的时候也不错012---And not just at the fun stuff, but, like, talking too.
抱歉，你说过〝我们就当朋友〞012---Sorry, Joey. You said, "Let's just be friends."
你猜结果呢？012---So guess what?
- 怎样？ - 我们就只是朋友012---- What? - We're just friends.
好吧，好吧012---Fine. Fine.
今天我们四个人 何不一块吃饭？就朋友嘛012---So why don't the four of us go out and have dinner tonight? You know, as friends.
哪四个〝我们〞？012---What "four of us"?
你跟鲍柏 我跟我的女朋友…012---You and Bob, and me and my girlfriend, um...
摩妮卡012---...Monica.
摩妮卡，我告诉你 这家伙很适合你012---JOEY: Monica, I'm telling you, this guy is perfect for you.
甭想！自从你那个打嗝天王亲戚后 我就不再相信你了012---Forget it! Not after your cousin who could belch the alphabet.
拜托，这家伙很棒 他叫鲍柏，他是安琪拉的…012---Come on, this guy's great. His name's Bob. He's Angela's...
兄弟012---...ahem, brother.
他很聪明又见过世面…012---He's smart, he's sophisticated...
而且他有正当工作012---...and he has a real job.
我一个月试镜三次 就说我是个演员，不过他是…012---Me, I go on three auditions a month and call myself an actor, but Bob is...
- 老天爷啊 - 干嘛？012---- Oh, God, help us. - What?
丑陋裸男在铺厨房地砖012---Ugly Naked Guy is laying kitchen tile.
呕012---BOTH: Ew!
我是在请你帮忙012---Look, I'm asking a favor here.
只要我帮她兄弟这个忙012---I'm thinking if I do this for her brother...
安琪拉也许就会回到我身边012---...maybe Angela will come back to me.
你干嘛？ 你的女朋友加起来有几卡车012---What's going on here? You go out with tons of girls.
我知道，不过…012---I know, but...
我犯了一个大错 我不该跟她分手的012---Look, I made a huge mistake. I never should've broke up with her.
你帮帮我好吗？拜托？012---Will you help me? Please?
好，再见012---Okay. Bye.
摩妮卡不去了 只剩下我跟瑞秋012---Monica's not coming. It's just gonna be me and Rachel.
等等，你这黄鼠狼 你仔细思考过了吗？012---Hold on there, camper. You sure you've thought this through?
只是去洗衣服 不太需要用到大脑吧012---It's laundry. The thinking through is pretty minimal.
只有你跟瑞秋？ 只有你们两个？012---It's just you and Rachel? Just the two of you?
这是约会 你们要去约会了012---This is a date. You're going on a date.
恩-啊012---Nuh-uh.
呀-哈012---Yeah-huh.
你觉得呢？012---What are you saying?
我该再刮一下胡子 或拿瓶酒过去吗?012---I should shave again? Pick up some wine? What?
嗯，你也许需要 再考虑一下你的脏内裤012---Well, you may wanna rethink the dirty underwear.
这将是她首次目睹你的内裤 你希望是脏脏的吗？012---It's the first time she'll see your underwear. You want it to be dirty?
不希望012---No.
还有柔衣精呢？012---And the fabric softener?
好，我的柔衣精又碍到谁了？012---Okay, okay. Now, what is wrong with my Snuggles?
怎样？这代表我是一个 感性、温暖的男人012---What? It says I'm a sensitive, warm kind of guy.
知道吗？就像一只毛绒绒的小熊012---You know, like a little fuzzy bear.
我在路上再买别的好了012---I can pick something else up on the way.
谢谢012---MONICA: Thank you.
这个鲍柏长什么样子？ 他是高还是矮？012---So what does this Bob guy look like? Is he tall, short?
对012---Yep.

那个拥抱感觉很残酷 对012---Yeah, the hug looked pretty brutal.
你又不在场012---Okay, you weren't there.
别挡路，让开，让开！012---WOMAN: Coming through! Move! Move!
不好意思！我在用这部机器012---Excuse me! I was kind of using that machine.
对，嗯，现在你好像没在用了012---Yeah, well, now you're kind of not.

什么？012---What?
没有洗衣粉就不能保留，好吗？012---No suds, no save, okay?
- 什么事？ - 嗨012---- What's going on? - Hi.

好，戏演完了012---All right. Show's over.
没什么好看的了012---Nothing to see here.
好，我们开始洗衣服了012---Okay. Let's do laundry.
太厉害了！ 我连不是我点的汤都不敢退还012---That was amazing! I can't even send back soup.
那是因为你是如此甜美、温柔…012---Well, that's because you're such a sweet, gentle...

瑞秋，你这些要分开吗？012---Rach, do you...? Are you gonna separate those?
哦，天012---Oh, God. Ugh.
我很洗衣白痴，对不对？012---Am I being like a total laundry spaz?
我是否该把上衣跟裤子 分别放入不同的洗衣机？012---Am I supposed to use one machine for shirts and another for pants?
你从来没洗过衣服吗？012---Have you...? Have you never done this before?
哦，我是没有啦 可是我认识一些洗过衣服的人012---Well, not myself. But I know other people that have.
好，被你逮到了 我是个洗衣处女012---Okay. You caught me. I'm a laundry virgin.
不要害怕 我会慢慢来012---Don't worry. I'll use the gentle cycle.
好吧012---Okay...
基本上，你得把所有白色的 放在一部机器里012---Basically, you wanna use one machine for all your whites.
白色的，好012---Whites. Okay.
- 有颜色的放入另一部 - 有颜色的012---- A whole other machine for your colors. - Colors.

贴身衣物 也就是你的胸罩…012---...delicates. And that would be your bras...
你的小内裤之类的012---...and your underpanty things.
这些是白色的棉质内裤012---Okay, well, these are white cotton panties.
是要跟白色的衣物放一起 还是跟贴身衣物呢？012---Would they go with whites or with delicates?
这得靠你自由心证了012---That would be a judgment call.
他好可爱！012---He's so cute!
你们在哪里长大的？012---So where did you guys grow up?

你跟安琪拉在一起，是吧？012---So you and Angela, huh?

- 你是个幸运的男人 - 是啊012---- You're a lucky man. - Yeah.
知道我最想念她哪里吗？012---You know what I miss the most about her?
她吃东西时发出的 可爱的小噪音012---That cute nibbley noise she makes when she eats.
就像一只快乐的小松鼠…012---Like a happy little squirrel...
或是黄鼠狼012---...or a weasel.
我没注意到012---I never really noticed.
哦，有 有，你要注意听012---Oh, yeah, yeah. Listen for it.
摩妮卡 摩妮卡很正012---Monica. Monica is great.
对，她是啊012---Yeah. Yeah, she is.
不过，不会长久012---But it's not gonna last.
对我而言 她在床上需求太多了012---She's too much for me in bed.
嘿咻方面012---Sexually.
我得告诉你 鲍柏超棒的012---I've gotta tell you, Bob is terrific.
对，说的可不是？012---Yeah, isn't he?
能遇到一个聪明、有趣012---It's so great to meet a guy who's smart and funny...
成熟度超过八岁的男人真好012---...and has an emotional age beyond 8.
还有你知道吗？ 他在床上的表现让人难以置信！012---You know what else? He's unbelievable in bed!
哇012---Wow!
我哥连他几岁失去童贞 都没告诉过我012---My brother never even told me when he lost his virginity.
呵012---Huh.
那很好啊012---That's nice.
你可以的 就像扯下OK绷一样012---You can do this. It's like pulling off a Band-Aid.
动作快点 伤口就会露出来了012---Just do it really fast, and then the wound is exposed.
快！快去！012---Go! Go!
珍妮丝012---Janice...
嗨，珍妮丝012---Hi, Janice.
好，开始了 我想我们不该再交往下去了012---Okay, here we go. I don't think we should go out anymore.

好的012---All right.
好吧012---Well...
好，你说了012---Well, there you go.
停，停，停012---Stop it, stop it, stop it.
我知道说来有点蠢…012---RACHEL: Okay, I know this is gonna sound really stupid...
不过我觉得 如果我今天能成功…012---...but I feel that if I can do this...
如果我真的能洗我自己的衣服…012---...if I can actually do my own laundry...
这世上就没有我办不到的事了012---...there isn't anything I can't do.
我倒觉得 这句话一点也不蠢012---That does not sound stupid to me.
卡萝离开我后 我第一次自己煮东西时…012---No, it's like... The first time I had to make dinner for myself after Carol left me...
对不起，我们的时间到了 下一次《罗斯秀》…012---I'm sorry, that's all the time we have. Next on Ross...

啊哦！衣服洗好了012---Uh-oh, the laundry's done
怎么了嘛？012---What's the matter?
没什么012---Nothing. Nothing.
衣服洗好了012---The laundry's done
得了，让我看012---Come on, show me.
只是你的白衣服里有一只红袜子 所以就…012---It's just that you left a red sock in with your whites, and now...
统统变成有点粉红的012---...everything's kind of pink. - Oh.
统统变成粉红的？012---Everything's pink?
只有那只红袜子例外 还是红的012---Except for the red sock, which is still red.
别难过 这种事大家都会遇到的012---Don't be upset. It can happen to anyone.
可是这次发生在我身上012---But it didn't. It happened to me.
天哪，我会变成 - 只粉红凯蒂猫！012---God, I'm gonna look like a big Marshmallow Peep!
我在干什么？012---What am I doing? What am I doing?
我爸爸说的对！ 我无法独立012---My father's right! I can't live on my own.
我连洗衣服都不会！012---I can't even do laundry!
那个超狗气球出状况了012---Something went wrong with Underdog...
他们又没办法帮狗头充气012---...and they couldn't get his head to inflate.
总之…012---So anyway...
狗头就在百老汇上 直直滚下去，对吧？012---...his head is, like, flopping down Broadway.
我就在想012---And I'm thinking...
这真的是不对劲012---...how inappropriate this is.
我的眼里有东西 乔伊，我们到灯光下看看好吗？012---I've got something's in my eye. Joey, could we check it in the light, please?
- 哦，我的天！ - 干嘛？012---- Oh, my God! - What?
我们坐在同一桌吗？ 简直说是…012---Hello! Were we at the same table? It's like...
近亲乱伦012---...cocktails in Appalachia.
- 他们很亲密 - 亲密？她的舌头都跑到他耳朵里了012---- Come on, they're close. - Close? She's got her tongue in his ear.
你跟罗斯就没胡闹过012---Like you've never got a little rambunctious with Ross.
乔伊，这很病态 很恶心、很…012---Joey, this is sick. It's disgusting. It's...
这不是真的，对不对？012---...not really true, is it?
谁晓得什么才是真的？012---Who's to say what's true?
你在想什么？012---What were you thinking?
这没什么好得意的，好吗？012---Look, I'm not proud of this, okay?
嗯，也许是有一点啦012---Well, maybe I am a little.
噢 噢012---- Oh. - Ow!
- 我要走了！ - 等一下！012---- I'm out of here! - Wait! Come on!
