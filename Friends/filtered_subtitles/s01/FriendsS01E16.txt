能坏到哪去呢012---How bad could it be?
有答案了012---I think we have an answer.
她来干嘛？012---What's she doing here?
这是上帝的旨意 要我们在家用餐别乱跑012---This could be God's way of telling us to eat at home.
- 她被瑞夫餐馆开除了吗  - 昨晚我们去时…012---- Think she got fired at Riff's? - No, we were there last night.
她一直送箭鱼来 你有要去…012---She kept bringing swordfish. Are you gonna go?

- 绝对是她没错 - 对012---- It's definitely her. - Yeah.
真难以置信012---I can't believe you.
结果你还是无法开除她012---You still haven't told that girl she doesn't have a job yet?
你也没拆圣诞灯啊012---Well, you still haven't taken down the Christmas lights.
恭喜喔，你刚找了个 最难吵起来的话题012---Congratulations. I think you found the world's thinnest argument.
我只是想等到适当时机012---I'm just trying to find the right moment.
应该不难 因为你们现在交往012---Oh, well, that shouldn't be so hard, now that you're dating.
〝亲爱的，你被开除了 不过上班前我们快快来一下如何〞012---"Sweetheart, you're fired. But how about a quickie before I go to work?"
- 好 - 好012---- Hey. - Hey.

我天花板很吵012---I can hear you through the ceiling.
我的猫睡不着012---My cats can't sleep.
你根本没养猫啊012---You don't even have cats.
我本来可能养的012---I could have cats.
再见，黑考斯先生012---Goodbye, Mr. Heckles.
我们会小声点012---We'll try to keep it down.
菲比，可以帮个忙吗012---Phoebe, can you do me a favor?
试穿一下看合不合身012---Try this on to make sure it fits.
我这辈子第一次收到的生日礼物 真的很…012---Oh, my first birthday present. Oh, this is really...

你们玩真的012---Wow, this is serious.
我从没见过你肯 为女朋友花钱012---I've never known you to pay money for any kind of capade.
不知道，我就是喜欢她啊012---I don't know. I like her.
她跟别人不同 她有某种特质012---She's different. There's, uh, something about her...
让你迷上她 懂了，你喜欢她，很好012---That you like. We get it. You like her. Great.
菲比，我事先问过你 你说没意见的啊012---Hey, Phoebe, I asked you, and you said it was okay.
但现在有意见了012---Well, maybe now it's not okay.
好吧012---Okay.
但现在我对你有意见这事 很有意见了012---Well, maybe now I'm not okay with it not being okay.
好吧012---Okay.

她还在012---She's still here.
是，她还在012---Yes. Yes, she is.
我不是有附纸条给你报告过012---Didn't I memo you on this?
我开除她后，她的心理医师 法兰医师012---See, after I let her go, uh, I got a call from her psychiatrist, Dr. Flanen...
发蓝医师012---...Dr. Flanan, Dr. Flan.
告知我，她对开除一事 适应不良012---And, uh, he informed me that she took the news rather badly.
还用了非常激动这样的字眼012---In fact, he, uh, mentioned the word "frenzy."
少开玩笑了 她明明就很…012---You're kidding. She seems so...
没有，妮娜吗？她…012---Oh, no, no. Nina? She's:
要是你去问她012---In fact, if you asked her now...
她对被开除一事 完全没有印象了012---...she'd have no recollection of being fired at all.
太不可置信了012---That's unbelievable.
却又很可信012---And yet believable.
所以我决定 在确定她不会伤害自己012---So I decided not to fire her again...
或其他人之前 不要再开除她一次012---...until I'm sure she will be of no threat to herself or others.
好吧，人对事情的反应 真的很难预料012---I see. Hmm. You never really know what's going on inside a person's head.
所以才有心理学吧 老板012---Well, I guess that's why they call it psychology, sir.
这声音是爸妈都终生难忘的012---NARRATOR [ON TV]: The sound Mom and Dad will never forget.

刚才那女人…012---What that woman...
的表现012---...did.
我才不要经历那种事012---I am not doing that. Heh.
只要宝宝不生出来就好了 那就一切依旧012---It'll have to stay in, that's all. Everything will be the same.
- 只要不生出来 - 卡萝，亲爱的012---- It'll just stay in. Ha, ha. - Carol, honey. Shh.

可以把这肉块 从这推出去吗012---Mind if we push this pot roast through it?"
卡萝，亲爱的012---Carol, sweetie.
深呼吸吐气012---Cleansing breath.
我知道这很吓人 但往想远一点012---I know it's frightening. But big picture:
生产不过是那短短一天012---The birth part is just one day...
等生完后，我们这辈子 就成了人家的父母了012---...and when it's over, we'll all be parents for the rest of our lives.
这么辛苦不就是为了这点吗012---SUSAN: I mean, that's what this is all about, right?
对吧，罗斯012---Ross?

你可以办到的012---Oh, you're gonna be great.
你怎么知道012---How could you say that?
我连叫马塞尔别吃浴室踏垫 都没办法了012---I can't even get Marcel to stop eating the bathmat.
要怎么养育小孩012---How will I raise a kid?
科学家说…012---You know, Ross, some scientists are now saying...
猴子和小孩是不一样的012---...that monkeys and babies are actually different.
- 去哪  - 出去012---- Where are you going? - Out.

有没012---Yet?
虽然这不干你事012---Well, not that it's any of your business...
但还没，可以吗012---...but no, we haven't, okay?
你是指做爱对吧012---You meant sex, right?
- 有空吧 - 有，妮娜，怎么了012---- Do you have a sec? - Uh, sure, Nina. What's up?
不知道，过去几天 大家都躲着我012---I don't know. For the past couple days, people have been avoiding me...
看到我表情都怪怪的012---...and giving me these really strange looks.
喔，可能是因为…012---Oh, well, uh, maybe that's because...
大家都嫉妒我们吧012---...they're, uh, jealous of us.
可能012---Maybe.
但他们收走剪刀 就说不通了吧012---But that doesn't explain why they keep taking my scissors.
