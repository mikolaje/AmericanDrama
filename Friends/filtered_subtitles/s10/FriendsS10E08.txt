-嗨  -嗨012---- Hey, guys. - Hey.
-嗨  -嗨012---- Hi. - Hey.
我们有点事和你们谈谈012---We need to talk about something.
我们觉得012---Yeah. We don't feel like
今年我们不能再作东感恩节晚餐了012---we can host Thanksgiving this year.
-什么... -你是在开玩笑吧012---- What... - Are you kidding?
连带工作  还有领养孩子的压力012---Well, it's just with work and the stress of adoption...
我们只是觉得没有精力弄了012---...we don't feel like we have the energy.
而且每年都让我们受累012---Plus, we don't think it's fair
这不公平012---that every year the burden falls on us.
这口气不像你啊012---That doesn't sound like you.
这像是莫妮卡的话012---That's Monica talking.
不  不  这是我们两个人的决定012---No, no, we made this decision together.
你把她放你嘴里的话  又说了一遍012---She's putting words in your mouth.
你不应该把话放到我们口中012---Don't you put words in people's mouths.
而是把火鸡放到我们口中012---You put turkey in people's mouths.
我真不敢相信012---I can't believe this.
这可是艾玛的第一个感恩节012---This is Emma's first Thanksgiving.
才不是...012---No, it's not.
不是吗  她什么时候出生的012---It's not? When was she born?
我个人认为012---Well, personally,
你们是应该休息一下子了012---I think it's great you're giving yourself a break.
谢谢  菲比012---Thank you, Pheebs.
不客气  这样倒好012---Sure. It's just as well.
我是说  去年的晚餐也没那么好012---I mean, last year wasn't very good.
她已江郎才尽  今年不会更好了012---I think she's losing her touch.
什么  你大错特错了  女士012---What? You are way off, lady.
是么  真的吗  是么012---Am l? Really? Am l?
那你就再做一次感恩节大餐012---Well, why don't you cook Thanksgiving dinner
证明我错了012---and prove me wrong.
你好好想想012---Well, think about it.
你这是在跟去年的你比拼012---You'd be trying to top what you did last year.
你是在和...自己竞争012---You'd be in competition with yourself.
大爱啊012---That's my favorite kind.
好吧  今年我们继续012---Okay, we are doing this.
别让自己这么容易被左右012---Don't let yourself get manipulated this way.
不关你的事  钱德勒012---Stay out of this, Chandler.
这是"我"和"我"之间的事情012---This is between me and me.
这件事012---We are supposed to
我们应该一起决定啊012---make these decisions together.
还记得我给你录的菲尔医生怎么说的么012---Did you not watch the Dr. Phil I taped for you?
《老友记》  第十季  第8集 感恩节晚餐大家都迟到了012---Friends S10E08 The One With The Late Thanksgiving
-嗨  -嗨  感恩节快乐012---- Hey. - Hi. Happy Thanksgiving.
火鸡殉难日快乐012---Happy Needless Turkey-Murder Day.
我从布利克012---You guys, I ordered some chocolate pies
订了些巧克力派012---from that bakery on Bleeker.
你们能帮我去取回来么012---Could you pick them up for me?
你不自己作派吗012---You're not making the pies?
不  我不做巧克力派的012---I don't make chocolate pies.
我小时候012---When I was younger,
参加过一个吃派比赛012---I entered this pie-eating contest.
吃得太多了012---I ate so many
导致我一想就恶心012---that the thought of them makes me sick.
那你赢了没有012---Did you at least win the contest?
两分钟吃了12个外加1片012---Two minutes, twelve pies and a part of one tin.
好吧  我们4点见012---Okay, I'll see you guys at 4.
很让人期待哦012---Can't wait.
今年的晚餐一定棒极了012---This dinner is gonna be so great.
去年的莫妮卡  我要你好看012---In your face, last-year me.
-嗨  瑞秋  -嗯012---- Hey, Rach? - Yeah.
艾玛今天的行程是什么012---What's Emma doing today?
我们看看啊012---Well, let's see,
我只知道她今天要和律师见面012---I know that she has a meeting with her lawyer...
然后呢  她要拉个大便012---...and then she has to make a very big poop.
怎么了012---Why?
我想让她参加婴儿选美012---Well, I want to enter her in a baby pageant.
哦  天呐012---Oh, my God.
这是我听说过的最让人毛骨悚然的事情了012---That's the creepiest thing I've ever heard.
在你拒绝之前  听我说012---Okay, but before you say no,
我朋友苏珊娜带她的孩子参加了012---my friend Suzanne is entering her kid.
和艾玛比起来012---And compared to Emma,
那小家伙就像只小狗012---she's a real dog.
哦  菲比  所有孩子都是美丽的012---Phoebe, all babies are beautiful.
好吧012---Oh, okay.
不  菲比012---No. Phoebe,
难道我们只是为了一个奖杯012---just the idea of pitting one baby against another...
就把孩子们比来比去012---...l mean, you know,
决定谁更漂亮012---and judging who's cuter just for a trophy...
还有一千块奖金012---And a thousand dollars.
对此我很感兴趣012---...is something I'm very interested in.
对了  千万别告诉罗斯012---Oh, please, do not tell Ross.
他还是相信012---He still believes that
内在的东西才重要012---what's on the inside is important.
对了艾玛得012---Okay. And Emma needs a cowgirl outfit
穿牛仔装参加比赛012---for the competition.
感恩节我上哪儿找牛仔装啊012---Where am I gonna get a cowgirl outfit on Thanksgiving?
我在想...012---Well, I was thinking--
把乔伊的椰菜娃娃的衣服扒了012---Take the clothes off Joey's Cabbage Patch Kid!
又有人把指挥棒给掉了012---Did someone drop the baton again?
为什么从堪萨斯那么老远来012---Why come all the way from Kansas
就为了做这个012---to do that?
老娘不是越来越老  而是越来越好012---I don't get older, I just get better.
你知道我刚想到什么012---You know what just occurred to me?
这可能是最后一次012---This could be our last Thanksgiving
只有我们两个人一起过感恩节了012---just the two of us.
我是说  我们很快就会有个孩子了012---I mean, we could be getting a baby soon.
你怎么知道012---You don't know that.
有人会选择我们的012---Somebody's gonna pick us.
可是这几周012---But we haven't heard a thing
我们都没收到领养消息012---from the adoption agency.
我告诉你  肯定会的012---I'm telling you, it's gonna happen.
明年会是012---Next year,
你我还有小海明威·宾012---it's gonna be you, me and little Hemingway Bing.
干嘛  他是我最喜欢的作家012---What? He's my favorite author.
说出他一本书的名字012---Name one of his books.
《企业》012---The Firm?
好吧  火鸡已经在烤箱里了012---Okay, let's see. Okay, the turkey's in the oven.
添料也准备好了012---The stuffing is ready.
你知道么012---You know,
你总是自己弄这些东西012---you always cook this meal all by yourself.
今年让我帮帮你吧012---Let me help this year.
钱德勒  这太好了012---Oh, Chandler, that's sweet.
但你不用一直按菲尔医生说的做012---But you don't have to do everything Dr. Phil tells you to do.
我是认真的  让我做点什么吧012---I'm serious, let me do something.
不是给火鸡填馅  做点不难的东西  .012---Just not the turkey. Nothing high-profile.
我想想...012---Okay, let's see.
啊  酸梅酱012---Oh, the cranberry sauce.
很容易做012---It's easy to make,
而且大家也不是很在意那东西012---and no one really cares about it.
还有呢012---Tell me more.
我去对门儿检查别的012---I'm gonna go check on something across the hall.
你先把这个洗干净吧012---You start by washing these.
别用洗涤剂012---Not with soap!
你肯定没吃过我沐浴液洗过的土豆012---You obviously haven't tasted my Palmolive potatoes.
嘿  猜猜乔伊拿到了什么012---Hi. Hey, guess what Joey has.
三张今天纽约流浪者的票012---Three tickets to today's Rangers game!
兄弟  我是让他猜的012---Dude, I wanted him to guess.
哦  天哪012---Oh, my God.
是啊  而且都是好座位哦012---Yeah, they're great seats too.
猜猜什么位置012---Guess where they are.
正中间012---Center ice.
我是不是和你有什么过节012---Did I do something to you?
比赛一点开始012---The game's at 1.
怎样012---So?
晚饭四点开始  我们赶不回来的012---Dinner's at 4. We'll never make it back.
那我们就提前退场012---So we'll leave before it's over.
我们会准时回来的012---We'll be back in time.
你现在这么说012---You said that now.
可是到时候必定要花很多时间回来的012---But it could take us a long time to get back home.
另外乔伊可能会迷路012---Plus, Joey could get lost
他们还得喊我们把他领会来012---and they could have to page us to go pick him up.
老兄  事不过三012---Dude, two times that happened!
莫妮卡为了做晚饭忙了一整天012---Look, Monica's been working hard all day.
她一开始的时候是不想做的012---She didn't want to host in the first place.
我们不该去的012---We shouldn't go.
他说得没错儿012---He's right, man.
好吧  那么四点钟见012---Yeah, I guess. So we'll see you at 4.
嗯012---Okay.
准备好品尝012---And get ready to taste
我的特制酸梅酱哦012---my very special cranberries.
或者  应该叫做"钱式酸梅"012---Or should I say "Chan-berries"?
伙计  你真够搞笑的012---That's some gentle comedy, dude.
我们还是要去看比赛的  对吧012---We're still going to the game, right?
是的012---Yeah.
嘿012---Hey.
菲比  我想走了012---Phoebe, listen, I think we gotta go.
这地方让我坐立不安012---This place is freaking me out.
你看到那边那个人了么012---I've been watching this guy over there.
我可不认为他带来的是个孩子012---I don't think he came with a kid.
但你现在不能离开啊012---But we can't leave now.
有一个叫黑利的小孩012---There was this one baby, Haley,
是夺冠的大热门012---who was favored to win...
得了哮喘  不得不待在家里012---...she got croup, so she had to stay home.
这次比赛才大开方便之门  家长们012---This competition just blew wide-open, folks.
菲比  这太奇怪了012---Phoebe, it's just too weird.
我看见一个一岁的小孩穿连裤袜012---I just saw a 1 -year-old with pantyhose on.
我知道  我们准备的确实不够充分012---Oh, I know. We should've been more prepared.
没事儿  我觉得012---It's okay. Now, the way I see it,
咱们最有力的竞争对手是卡梅伦012---our real competition now is Cameron.
天呐  她的衣服被脱掉了012---My God, they just took her sweater off.
看他的手臂  你好  米其林先生012---Look at those arms. Hello, Michelin Man.
菲比012---Phoebe, come on.
已经都三点了012---You know what, it's already 3:00.
他们还没有评审到艾玛这一组012---They haven't even gotten to Emma's group yet.
我们该走了  回去吃饭012---We got dinner.
但是艾玛的条件都具备了012---But Emma's got what it takes.
她一定能走到最后012---She could go all the way!
菲比  冷静点012---Phoebe, you have to calm down.
好吧012---Okay.
瑞秋  三州交界地区012---Rachel, the hottest babies in the tri-state area
最漂亮的宝贝们都在这里了012---are in this room right now.
而我听见一个评审说012---I overheard a judge say
没人比得过艾玛012---that not one of them holds a candle to Emma.
-真的么  -没错012---- Really? - Yeah.
你听见他们这么说012---You heard him say that?
对012---Yeah.
好吧  那就让我们012---All right. Okay. All right,
给其他的孩子们一点悲惨的回忆012---let's give these babies something to cry about.
太好了  开工吧012---Good. Let's get down to business.
艾玛需要化妆012---Emma needs some makeup.
什么012---What?
不化妆跟其它孩子比起来会逊色三分的012---She's gonna look washed-out next to the others.
菲比  我不会让你给我的孩子化妆的012---No, Phoebe, I'm not letting you put makeup on my baby.
为什么不012---Why not?
因为我已经给她化过了012---Because I already did.
太逊了  快下场吧  你个白痴012---You suck! Get off the ice, you idiot!
-太精彩了  -没错  耶012---- What a game. - I know. Yeah.
钱德勒错过了这场比赛真遗憾啊012---I can't believe Chandler's missing this.
我也替他觉得遗憾012---I'm sorry he's not here.
但我不得不说012---But I gotta say,
我真的很喜欢这个"玉米片"座012---I am really enjoying nacho chair.
嗯  要是你不总是把我的手打开012---Yeah, I'd probably enjoy it more
我也许会更喜欢些012---if you didn't keep batting my hand away.
这位置太棒了012---These seats are great.
是啊  没错012---I know, I know.
上次在这看假期冰上节目012---When I was here for "Holidays on lce" ...
座位太远了012---...l was sitting so far away,
关颖珊根本就看不到我举的条幅012---Michelle Kwan couldn't read my banner.
我们该走了啦012---We'd better get going.
现在不走  回去吃饭就晚了012---If we don't leave now, we're gonna be late.
可比赛太精彩了012---But it's a tie game.
回去晚点应该可以吧012---So we're a little late.
女生们会在那的012---The girls will be there.
再进一个球再走啦012---Let's just stay for one more goal.
-不好吧  -再有人打一架012---- I don't know. - One more fight.
-好吧  -好吧012---- Okay. - Okay.
大家都哪里去了012---Where is everybody?
他们迟到了45分钟012---They're 45 minutes late.
我真不敢相信他们还没来012---I can't believe they're not here.
我那么辛苦这一天是为了什么012---I slave and I slave for what?
他们毁了我的酸梅酱日012---They've ruined Cranberry Day.
我们迟到了多久012---How late are we?
45分钟012---Forty-five minutes.
-给  -好的.012---- Here. - Okay.
瑞秋和菲比应该已经到了012---Rachel and Phoebe are already there,
所以他们可能已经开始了012---so they probably started without us.
我们溜进去012---We could just slip in,
这样谁都不会注意我们的012---and no one needs to know where we were.
你不把这个泡沫大手指扔掉么012---You may want to lose the foam finger.
哦  才不呢012---Oh, no, no, no.
你只是想把它套在你手上012---You just want to put it on your hand.
你们没在里面012---You're not at Thanksgiving?
没  我们迟到了012---No, we're late.
你们在这里干什么012---What are you doing here?
我们也迟到了012---We're late too.
我们本以为我们可以迟到012---We figured we could be late
因为你们会准时到012---because you'd be on time.
别用这个指着我  姓崔的012---Don't point that thing at me, Tribbiani.
那...里面没人012---So nobody's here?
莫妮卡会杀了我们的012---Monica's gonna kill us.
你们到什么地方去了012---Yeah, where were you?
奖杯怎么来的012---Yeah, what's with the trophy?
嗯  我们去参加拼字大赛了012---Well, we were at a spelling bee.
我赢了012---And I won.
你在感恩节这天012---You won an adult
赢得了一场成人拼字游戏012---Thanksgiving Day spelling bee?
是  Y-E-S  是012---Yes. Y-E-S. Yes.
让我看看...012---Let me see this.
纽约区超级无敌小可爱012---"Grand Supreme Little Darling, New York Division"?
那便是我012---That's me.
你们让艾玛参加了选美比赛012---You entered Emma in a beauty pageant?
而且看起来她还给她化了妆012---And it looks like she put makeup on her.
等等...012---Wait a second...
我好像在什么地方见过这身牛仔...012---Where have I seen that cowgirl outfit before?
无法置信012---I can't believe this.
她是我们的女儿012---She's our daughter.
你把她当成观赏狗一样012---That you would treat her like some kind of show dog
不可饶恕012---is inexcusable.
她为我们赢得了一千美元012---She won a thousand dollars.
这比赛是一年一次的吗012---So this is an annual thing?
啊  这是艾莉西亚·梅·埃默里的服装012---That's Alicia May Emory's outfit!
伙计们  有人在里面012---Guys, there are people in there
要发火了012---who are not getting any happier.
我们该怎么办012---What are we gonna do?
我不知道  你们想办法012---I don't know, you guys figure it out.
我先把艾玛送回去睡觉012---I gotta put Emma down for a nap.
哦  瑞秋  你进去012---And, Rach, while you're in there,
给艾莉西亚·梅穿件衣服012---throw something on Alicia May.
好吧  我们该怎么说012---All right, what are we gonna say?
我们可以说  我们被抢劫了012---We'll say that we were mugged.
当有人被抢了的时候012---You can't get mad at someone
你怎么还会生他气012---who's been mugged.
不错  但你看起来不像被抢过012---Good. But you don't look like you were mugged.
不像  这样才像012---No. Here.
嘿012---Hey!
你有没有听到什么012---Do you hear something?
-他们都在外面  -让我看看012---- They're out there. - Let me see.
我真不敢相信012---I can't believe this.
他们迟到了一小时012---They're an hour late,
还在那里聊天012---and they're just standing there talking.
一切都乱套了012---Everything's so distorted.
乔伊有只大手012---It looks like Joey has a giant hand.
上面写"流浪者"012---That says "Rangers" on it.
他们去看比赛了012---They went to the game.
这下我饶不了他们012---Oh, they are in for a world of pain.
罗斯的衬衫撕坏了012---Ross' shirt is torn.
他们不但迟到  而且衣衫不整012---They're late and they're sloppy.
好了  艾玛睡下了012---All right, Emma's napping.
你的衬衫怎么了012---What happened to your shirt?
我被抢了012---I got mugged,
他们还抢走了我的口袋012---and they stole my pocket.
我们是在找借口012---We're just trying to figure out an excuse.
这样如何012---How about this?
我们可以说012---We could say that
莫妮卡告诉我们是5点  而不是4点012---Monica told us 5:00, not 4:00.
这样我们就没迟到而且很准时012---That way we're right on time.
或者  我们可以在房间里藏些迷药012---Or we could plant PCP in the apartment
打电话让警察把她抓了012---and call the cops on her.
嗯  这的确是个012---That would be a good way
下迷药的好办法012---to get rid of all the PCP we have lying around.
你可以就说她说的是5点012---We'll just say that she said it was 5:00.
保持自然些012---We'll just act casual.
所以我们根本没有迟到012---We're not late, we're right on time.
"我们知道你们在外面"012---"We know you're out there."
你觉得这是谁写的012---Who do you think it's from?
天啊  糟了  简直太糟了012---Oh, God, this is bad. This is so bad.
好吧  让我们进去面对他们吧012---Well, let's just go in there and face them.
我不要先进去012---I'm not going in first.
莫妮卡前额上的青筋肯定快爆裂了012---I bet that vein on Monica's forehead is popping like crazy.
我也讨厌啊012---I hate that thing.
那张脸就像扭曲的闪电一样012---It's like a bolt of lightning.
我有主意了012---I have an idea.
我们可以玩石头剪子布012---Why don't we play Rock, Paper, Scissors,
输了的先进去012---and whoever loses, goes in first.
-好吧  我参加  -准备012---- All right, I'm in. - Ready.
啊  我赢了012---I win.
这是什么012---What is that?
火焰  赢过一切012---That's fire. It beats everything.
真的么  能赢过一个水球么012---Oh, really? Does it beat water balloon?
好极了  菲比·布菲  玩得真好012---Well-played, Phoebe Buffay. Well-played.
好啦好啦012---All right, enough,
让我们一起进去算了012---let's all go in at the same time.
-好  -好012---- Okay. - Okay.
锁住了012---It's locked.
什么  他们现在倒把门锁上了012---What? Oh, sure, now they lock it.
当他们在沙发上做爱时012---When they're having sex
就像是在说012---on the couch, it's like:
"快进来  快进来  我的屁股上毛好多  "012---"Come on in, my butt is surprisingly hairy!"
好吧  别闹了  里面的两位012---All right, come on. All right, you guys,
很抱歉我们迟到了012---we're so sorry we're late.
让我们进去一起吃晚餐吧012---Please let us in so we can have dinner together.
不  东西都凉了012---No, everything's cold.
火鸡干了  馅也松了012---The turkey's dried out and the stuffing's all soggy.
嗯  而且那碗酸梅酱也……012---Yeah, and there's a bowl of cranberry sauce that's--
酸梅酱怎么了012---What happens to cranberry sauce?
没事儿  很好012---Nothing, it's fine.
哦  谢天谢地012---Oh, thank God.
好啦  伙计们  真的抱歉012---Come on, you guys, we're sorry.
回来的路上  地铁坏了012---Our subway broke down.
说谎012---That's a lie!
你们去看比赛了012---You went to the game.

真不敢相信012---Well, I cannot believe this.
你们强迫我做饭012---You forced me to make dinner,
又迟到一小时012---you're an hour late...
居然还忘记了012---...and you forget the one little thing

真的  女孩子们  这就是你们不对了012---Really, girls, not cool.
好吧  你们男人又好到哪里去012---Well, you man-heads aren't any better.
你们说谎  去看比赛012---You lied about going to the game.
明知道会迟到012---You knew it'd make you late,

好吧  我们走012---Fine, let's just go.
我们可以不在这里吃饭012---I don't need your stupid dinner.
如果你没流口水的话012---That would be a lot more convincing
你的话可能更可信点012---if you weren't drooling.
哦  原来是你的口水012---Oh, is that what that is?
