The way you crushed Mike at Ping-Pong was such a turn-on.
You wanna...?
You know, I'd love to, but I'm a little tired.
I'll put a pillowcase over my head.
You're on.
- Hey. - What's up?
Well, Mike's taking a shower,
which,by the way, there's no law against.
And then we're gonna grab some food. So if you want--
- Finally. - Is that Ross?
Yeah. You can hear everything through these stupid walls.
Sounds like he's with someone.
He could be alone.
This morning I heard him do pushups
and then talk to his triceps.
Wait a minute, I think Phoebe's right.
Yeah, I hear someone else in there with him.
- Dr. Geller! - God, you're amazing.
I didn't even have to ask you to call me that.
Oh, my God, that's Charlie!
She's cheating on Joey with Ross!
Oh, that tart! Floozy! Giant!
I'm not sure about this.
Yeah, you're right.
This is none of our business.
I'm not sure it's the best way  to hear everything.
Some one give me a glass!
No, I'm not gonna do this, okay?
I'm not gonna eavesdrop on my friend.
I love Barbados.
I can't believe I'm kissing you.
I'm kissing Rachel!
I know. I'm her.
Rachel and Joey! It's Rachel and Joey!
- What? - Get over here!
Oh, my God! I love how thin these walls are!
Thank you.
Friends S10E01 The One After Joey and Rachel Kiss
Hey, before, you said that nothing could happen
between us. What changed?
Well, I only said that because of Ross.
And then I saw him kissing Charlie.
What?
Ross and Charlie?
Wow! She's really making her way
through the group, huh?
- Eh, who am I to talk?  - Yeah.
I can't believe this. Rachel and Joey?
How about the dinosaur twins
in the other room?
- No one is manning that wall! - I'm on it!
- Anything?  - I think I hear curtains closing.
We've got shoes being kicked off over here.
Bedsprings! Unmistakable!
You realize that's your brother.
Not until you said it. Somebody switch!
Wow! Wait a minute.
Ross and Charlie. Joey and Rachel.
Phoebe and Mike.
We're the only ones leaving with the person we came with!
That's not true. I came with Monica,
I'm leaving with Weird Al.
Okay, I've had it with the hair jokes.
Tomorrow I'm going to the salon.
Okay, Buckwheat.
You gotta hear this,
it's great! It's like free porn.
Is everything okay?
It's just-- I don't think I can do this.
Oh, is it because of what might be on the bedspread?
I saw that report, with the infrared--
No! No.
No.
Look, I need to talk to Joey.
I mean, you guys just broke up.
Before anything more happens between us,
I need to know he's okay with it.
I completely understand.
All right, I'm gonna go find him.
I just need a second before I can, you know....
Grandma...
- Okay, I'll see you later. - Okay!
That's the door. He's gone.
And she's turning on the TV...
...and watching Miss Congeniality.
Honey? If you know it
through a wall, you know it too well.
Hey, what are you guys doing?
We're just-- We're sad to go,
so we're  just saying goodbye to the hotel.
I love you
Paradise Hotel Golf Resort and Spa.
Yeah. We had a great time, thank you.
Bye.
Okay. Hey, have you guys seen Joey anywhere?
He's probably in his room
with his current girlfriend, Charlie.
That's the situation as we know it.
If you see him,
could you tell him I'm looking for him?
- You got it.  - Thanks.
Thank you.
Other wall, people! Other wall!
Rach, you there?
Oh, my God, that's Ross!
What are we gonna do?
Okay, just be calm.
For all he knows, we're just hanging out.
All right? So just be nonchalant.
That's not nonchalant!
No idea what it means.
Okay, just hide.
- Rach?  - Coming! Try under the bed.
There's no room under the bed
- Is everything okay?  - Yeah.
- Hey. Do you know where Joey is?  - Hi.
I really don't.
Can I talk to you for a minute?
Yeah. Sure.
I don't believe this. Have you guys been--?
This is the listening side of the wall.
Then she told me
that she and Joey had broken up
and part of the reason was she had feelings for me.
Right. Yeah.
You know I've wanted to ask Charlie out
since the day I met her.
Oh, I know, I know.
That's been really hard for you.
Anyway, one thing led to another, and...
...before you know it, we were kissing.
How angry do you think Joey's gonna be?
That is hard to say, Ross.
That is hard to say.
I gotta find him.
He's gotta be here someplace.
You would think.
Joey?
- Is he gone?  - How are you doing this?
What? Hey!
What are you--? What is this?
Have you been listening this entire time?
Yeah!
Now, what is this?
What is this? Well, let's see.
We kissed for 10 minutes...
...and now we're talking to our friends about it,
so I guess this is sixth grade.
No, no. Have you thought about
how complicated this could get?
What about Ross?
Look, he's with Charlie now.
Yeah, but he wants to talk to you
before anything really happens with her.
And as his friend,
I mean, don't you think
he deserves the same from you?
You're a pain in my ass, Geller.
All right, you guys.
Look, we appreciate all the advice...
...but this is between Joey and me.
And I think We can handle it.
We'll go.
Will you do one thing for us,
the people that care about you?
- Sure.  - Enunciate.
Get out!
Are they right?
Probably, yeah. I mean, maybe we should
hold off until we talk to Ross.
Yeah. Yeah. We can wait.
We don't have to do anything tonight.
Yeah, I think that would be best.
So, I'm gonna-- I'm gonna take off.
- Although--  - I like "although."
I mean, you know....
Ross and I haven't dated in, like...
...six years.
Six years?
Wow. That's almost as long as high school.
Plus, you know, he is with Charlie now.
Absolutely.
- He's not thinking about you.  - No.
I'm thinking about you.
Yeah.
- Let's forget about Ross.  - It's forgotten.
- What's wrong?  - Nothing.
Seriously, what is it?
Nothing. It's really...
it's nothing. Come here...
What's wrong?
Sorry, I just...
I can't seem to get Ross out of my head.
Well, maybe I can help.
Your lips are so soft. Do that again.
Yeah, we need to talk to Ross. Yeah.
Hey. You guys ready to go?
Not quite. Monica's at the salon,
and I'm just finishing packing.
Dude, you're not taking your Bible?
You're not supposed to take that.
Besides, it's a New Testament.
What are you gonna do with it?
Learn about Jesus.
- Hey!  - So did you talk to Joey?
No. I couldn't find him.
I'm just gonna talk to him on the plane.
Okay. Sounds like a good idea, Dr. Geller.
Stop it.
Ph.D.
You're filthy.
Hey. Have you guys seen Monica?
Actually, I think she went to the salon.
Oh, yeah. Oh, she went to the salon, all right.
Check it out!
Whose day just got better?
Chandler!
Hey!
- What do you think?  - I think...
I think I can see your scalp.
Don't you just love it?
Yeah. Yeah, you got shellfish in your head.
It's something. You go, girlfriend.
- You never said that in your life. - Not once.
I thought so.
Oh, and listen to this.
What do you know? It's a treat for the eyes
and the ears.
Wow, it's kind of weird that
I'm sitting next to Charlie after we broke up.
Yeah. It's almost as if Air Barbados
doesn't care about your social life.
Does someone mind switching
and sitting with Charlie?
Oh, I mean, l-- Dude,
I spent the whole conference with Charlie.
- I understand.  - No, I'll do it.
Wish I could switch.
I really don't want to
sit with Allen lverson over there.
Once we're in the air
and the captain turns off the seat belt sign
...you feel free to roam about my cabin.
And you should be careful
when checking your overhead bins.
Because items may shift during--
Oh, you're not good at this.
You don't have to go home tonight, do you?
Yea, I think I can come over.
It's Saturday, right?
What?
I can't do anything tonight.
Why not?
I have a date.
You have a...you have a date? With who?
Oh, it's my girlfriend.
- You have...you have a girlfriend?  - Yeah.
Well, when you and I broke up,
I started seeing someone.
- Well, for how long?  - Three months.
Three months?
Okay.
This is none of my business,
but how long are you gonna keep seeing her?
I'll tell her that it's over tonight at dinner.
I promise.
Oh, okay, good. You do that.
When you get home,
maybe there'll be a special delivery package
waiting for you.
Maybe I'll sign for it, tear it open.
Pull out the packing material--
You know what. We'll have sex.
Let's leave it there.
All right, I'm gonna go talk to Joey.
I think this is the right time.
He's in a good mood after the flight attendant says "duty-free."
Okay. Good luck.
Ross is coming over.
I think now would be a good time to talk to him.
I guess so. I'm just--I'm really nervous.
Well, keep in mind that by the time you're done...
...they'll probably be serving dinner.
Still nervous?
I'm gonna get the lasagna.
- Hey, Rach?  - Yeah?
Do you mind if I sit here for a sec?
Yeah. Yeah, sure. Yeah.
Good luck.
- Hey.  - Hey.
So l...
I kind of need to talk to you about Charlie.
Yeah?
Last night, after you guys broke up....
So sorry to hear about that, by the way.
Well, Charlie and I were talking, and...
You kissed.
Wh-- What?
What? What would give you that idea?
- I saw you.  - Yeah, we kissed.
But nothing else.
Nothing else happened, okay?
- Ross...It's okay.  - What?
It's okay. You know, look...
...l totally understand, all right? You guys...
...make way more sense than her and I ever did, you know?
And....
- I want you to be happy. - Are you serious?
Yeah.
- Now I have something--  - I am speechless.
I mean, the fact that you would
put my happiness first like that, I mean....
You're an incredible friend,
do you know that?
- Well, look, before you go--  - No, I mean it.
I mean, you're so loyal, man.
And selfless and generous.
I am those things, yeah.
I've known Chandler longer,
so I think of him as my best friend. But now...
...l may have to rethink some stuff.
Dude!
Hey, if there is ever anything I can do for you....
I can't think of anything.
- Thanks.  - Yeah.
- So hi.  - Hi.
So you talked to Joey?
Oh, yeah. We had a really good talk.
- Oh, that's great.  - Yeah.
So everything's okay?
Oh, no, it's great.
It's great. He's an amazing guy.
Oh, well, obviously, I think so too.
Well, I'm so excited about this.
Really? Excited?
What, are you kidding?
I have had some very dirty dreams about this.
Excuse me.
You didn't tell him, did you?
I couldn't.
He was saying all these really nice things about me.
I didn't want him to get mad
and take them back.
I'm gonna edge out Chandler!
Fine. Yon know what Joey. Forget it.
When we go back to New York, I will tell him.
Thank you. Yeah, I appreciate that.
- Hi, Mike's place.  - Hey, it's Mike.
- That was fast.  - Oh, no, she's not here yet.
You know, I'm just gonna take off
and break up with her over the phone.
You can't do that. Oh, come on,
Mike, strap on a pair.
Why don't you tell her that we got back together.
You know, women appreciate honesty.
We also appreciate gentle spanking
once in a while, just FYl.
One more thing.
There might be a picture of Precious on my coffee table.
Her name's Precious?
Is she a pure breed,
or did you pick her up at the pound?
Any way, I just want to give you a heads up.
Okay. And if she gets upset.
...just scratch her tummy
and give her a liver snap.
Hi. I'm Precious. Who are you?
- I'm Phoebe.  - Phoebe?
Mike's ex-girlfriend, Phoebe?
The love of his life? That Phoebe?
Oh, I can't wait for everyone at work to see these!
You go back to work tomorrow night?
Yeah.
So if you want people to see them...
...you're not having them taken out, say, at the break of dawn?
Well, if I had them taken out,
then I wouldn't be able to do this.
You like that, right?
What are you singing?
It's "Bolero" from 10.
It's "Ride of the Valkyries" from Apocalypse Now.
Here's the thing. The cornrows were
a solution to your frizzy-hair problem.
Now that we're home,
you don't have that problem.
If you think about it...
I hate them.
What? You said you liked them.
Did l? Let's refresh.
I believe what I said was
that I could see your scalp.
Well, fine. So you don't like them.
Everybody else does.
Again, let's journey back.
As I recall, Rachel said
she had never noticed the shape of your skull before.
And Joey?
Well, Joey didn't realize there was anything different.
You know what? I don't care.
I like it like this, and I'm gonna keep it.
You're just jealous
because your hair can't do this.
- Get yourself in the tooth? - And the eye.
Hi! There she is! Hi, Emma.
Oh, my God, I missed you.
Oh, Emma, I missed you so much. Hi.
Did you have a good time with Grandma Green? Huh?
Did she give you a bottle of antidepressants again
to use as a rattle?
That was one time, Ross,
and they were only, like, five milligrams.
Hey, Emma, Daddy has some presents for you, okay?
I want you to wait right here.
Come here, sweetie.
Ross, actually, there's something that
I really need to talk to you about.
Okay, shoot.
- Okay. All right, here's the deal.  - Oh, no!
What is it?
Oh, major shampoo explosion!
Look, Ross, this really isn't easy.
Oh, it's all over everything!
Why? Why me?
Because you took 300 bottles of shampoo?
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You were saying?
Well, yeah. Look, it's about me and--
Oh, not another one!
Oh, my--Oh, and this is moisturizer!
It's even harder to clean!
Why?
Why do bad things happen to good people?
Wow. Clearly this is not a good time.
You think?
Okay. Bye.
All right, so Mike's on his way over.
You thought you were meeting here,
he thought at the restaurant, so....
It doesn't matter who's right or wrong.
The point is, I'm gonna take off.
Wait. I'm not letting you leave
until you tell me what's going on here.
I mean...
...are you guys getting back together or something?
All right.
Susie-- Can I call you Susie?
My name is Precious.
I can't say that.
Susie, I'm gonna be straight with you.
Mike and I are back together.
And unfortunately...
...that effectively ends your relationship with him.
He's very sorry about that,
and wishes you the best luck in all your endeavors.
I just can't believe this. Why?
Well, I don't--
Why would he do this?
What's wrong with me?
There's nothing wrong with you.
What the hell am I supposed to do now?
Damn it, woman! Pull yourself together!
Have some pride, for the love of God!
Okay, not a fan of the tough love.
I just can't believe
that Mike didn't give me any warning.
He didn't know.
He wasn't planning on coming to Barbados
and proposing to me.
He proposed to you?
This is the worst birthday ever!
Look, Precious...
Mike's not worth this.
You're an attractive intelligent woman...
...and let's face it, Mike's kind of a wang.
He proposed to me while he was still seeing you.
He was gonna break up with you on your birthday?
I don't like to kiss and tell,
but he cheated on you a lot this weekend.
Oh, my God, you know, maybe you're right.
Maybe I don't need him.
I deserve to be treated with respect.
Screw you, Mike.
You're a coward and a bastard,
and I hope you rot in hell!
You're welcome.
Honey? You've been in there for a long time.
Is everything okay?
Not really.
I have a problem.
Really? What happened?
Well, I was dancing around and singing "No Woman, No Cry" ...
...and I got stuck.
You can't move at all?
Oh, I can move.
If I untangle you,
will you please get rid of the cornrows?
I guess so.
Some of these look a little frayed.
Yeah, I tried to gnaw myself free.
- Hey. - Hi.
- So? Did you tell Ross?  - Well, I tried...
...but then he had a shampoo-related emergency.
- So I guess now it's your turn again.  - No...
I think it's better if you tell him.
You know, it's easier for a woman.
That way, you know, if he gets mad, all you have to do is go
I didn't mean it.
I'm so sorry
Yeah, 'cause that's what we do.
Alright, alright, okay, uhm... How about this? Tomorrow...
Tomorrow we'll both go
and we'll tell him together.
Okay, that sounds fair.
That just means, once again, we can't--
I know...
That's okay.
I mean, we can control ourselves.
We're not animals.
- No! Of course, we can wait.  - Yeah.
All right, so I guess that means good night then.
Yep. Good night.
Good night.
Good night.
Seriously, good night.
Stop saying good night.
I'm so sorry.
Look what I found in the drawer.
And you said I'd never wear this.
Now that I untangled you,
how about you do a little something for me?
Sure. What did you have in mind?
I think you know.
Really? I don't-- I don't really feel like it.
This is what I want to do.
Okay.
I just don't get why you like it so much.
She's a FBI agent,
posing as a beauty contestant.
Okay, Ross.
I realize that you didn't expect to walk in and see that, but...
Let me explain, okay?
We weren't doing anything!
Rach, he just saw us.
But what you saw,
that is the extent of it, okay?
One kiss.
No, come on. That's a lie! We also kissed in Barbados.
Dude, chill!
Okay, we also kissed in Barbados...
...but we didn't plan it. Ok?
The only reason that that happened...
...was because I saw you kiss Charlie.
Yeah, you started it!  I have got to chill.
Look, we probably should
have talked to you about this before it ever happened.
But....
Oh, we feel so terrible about this, Ross.
Yeah. But it did happen.
So...
Ross?
Ross?
Can we just close the door?
Friends S10E02 The One Where Ross Is Fine
Ross, say something.
Anything.
So you two are...?
- Yeah. - Yeah.
And have you had...?
- No... - No...
But if I hadn't walked in here, would you...?
Probably--No. No.
Ross, this is not how we wanted you
to find out about this.
You have every right to go nuts.
I'm not going nuts.
Do you see me going nuts?
No, but you know what I mean.
If you two are happy...
...then I'm happy for you.
I'm fine.
- Really? - Absolutely.
I'm fine.
Totally fine.
I don't know why it's coming out
all loud and squeaky...
...because, really, I'm fine.
I'm not saying I wasn't a little surprised
to see you guys kissing.
I mean, at first I was like:
But now that I've had time to absorb it...
Loving this.
- Ross. - It's all working out.
Me and Charlie. And you two.
You know what we should do?
Calm ourselves?
No.
We should all have dinner.
Yes, we'll do it tomorrow night. I'll cook!
Look, don't you think that would be a little weird?
Weird? What? What's weird?
The only thing weird would be if someone didn't like Mexican food...
...because I'm making fajitas!
I do like fajitas.
God, this adoption stuff is so overwhelming.
There's inter-country adoption, dependency adoption.
There's so many ways to go,
and this is, like, the biggest decision of our lives.
There's a hair in my coffee.
Hey, guys.
Have you seen Frank Jr.?
He's meeting me here with the triplets.
It's funny, every time you say "triplets" ...
...l think of three hot, blond 19-year-olds.
That's sweet.
Drink your hair.
Hey, what's all this stuff?
They're brochures from different adoption agencies.
Babies! Oh, this one is so cute.
Get this one.
That's not really how it works.
- Oh, how does it work?  - I don't know!
If you're having a hard time,
you should talk to my friends...
...Bill and Colleen.
They adopted a kid.
I'm sure they'd help you.
Thanks, that would be great.
Hey, honey, wouldn't that be great?
All right, all right. Remember what we talked about.
When we're in a public place, there are certain rules.
That's not what we talked about!
- Hi, Frank. - Hi.
- Good to see you. - Good to see you too.
- Hi, Frank.  - Hi. Hey, how you doing?
Oh, my goodness, they've all gotten so big.
Which one is which again?
Well, that's Frank Jr. Jr...
...pulling the tampons out of the lady's purse.
And that's Chandler climbing on Chandler.
That's Leslie throwing bagels at him.
"Willing to adopt triplets?"  No.
Can I just say, I know we're doing this for Ross
and that's cool.
But if it was up to me,
this is not what we'd be doing on our first date.
Well, what would we be doing?
I'd take you out for a romantic night.
Some champagne, fancy dinner,
feel you up on the carriage ride home.
Feel me up?
In a carriage.
- Hey, Charlie! - Hi.
- Hi. - Hey.
So...
- ...dreading this?  - Oh, you bet.
So did you bring a little something for Ross?
Actually, it's some stuff you left at my apartment.
Well, thanks.
And you can just give me my stuff whenever you want.
Yeah, I didn't throw any of that out.
I thought I heard voices.
Hi, Charlie.
Hey, Joey.
And, oh, you're gonna have to introduce me to your new girlfriend.
I'm just kidding. I know Rachel. I know.
Come. Please come in. Come in.
Okay. Well, we brought you some wine.
That is so thoughtful.
She's a keeper.
And what did you bring me, huh?
Actually, that's--
Underwear, a toothbrush
...and a Van Halen CD.
I can use all these things!
Gosh, Ross, you know, you seem a little--
What? Fine? Because I am.
Aren't you? Aren't you? Aren't--? You see?
Who else is fine?
Come on.
Listen. Why don't you try to relax.
Maybe have a drink.
You know what, that is a very good idea.
I'm gonna go make a pitcher of margaritas.
Oh, God.
So adorable.
Look at them, sleeping there like angels.
Yeah, I really cherish these moments...
...because before you know it,
they're gonna be awake again.
Well, they may be a handful...
- ...but they're so cute.  - Yeah.
Oh, God, last time I babysat them,
they did the funniest thing.
I haven't slept in four years.
That's a long time.
You just don't know how hard it is, Phoebe.
There's just so many of them.
You know, two I could handle.
Two's great. You just hold one in each hand.
What do I do when the third one runs at me
with his bike helmet on?
I got no more hands to protect my area.
There's three of them, Phoebe. Three.
Yeah, I know, Frank.
I counted them
when they were coming out of my area.
Sometimes, I think that--
Oh, no, no, no, I can't say it.
It's too horrible. No.
What?
No, no, I can't.
Oh, my God, Frank.
Are you thinking of leaving?
Because I didn't have those triplets
so you could run out on them.
Oh, no, I would never do that. No. I just...
...was thinking that, you know,
maybe you could take one.
What?
You can't separate them,
that's terrible! Which one?
Thank you so much for seeing us.
Phoebe has told us
great things about you guys.
Please, we're happy to help.
We went through the same thing when we were adopting.
So a lot of malfunctioning
wee-wees and hoo-hoos in this room, huh?
I mean, you have a lovely home.
We appreciate anything you can tell us.
Well, actually, I think this might help.
It's pretty much...
...all the information you need.
Oh, my God.
Everything is broken into categories,
then cross-referenced.
Then color-coded to correspond with the forms in the back.
Thank you.
I think I just had a tiny orgasm.
I know the process is frustrating,
but it's so worth it.
Adopting Owen was the best thing
that ever happened to us.
That's great. Can I see the book?
You want me to wash my hands first, don't you?
It's just so pretty and white.
Bathroom is down the hall to your left.
I would have told him to do it too.
Can I adopt you?
- Hey, you must be Owen.  - Yeah.
I'm Chandler. Hey, I was in the Scouts too.
You were?
Yeah. In fact, my father was a den mother.
You know how to use a compass?
I have a badge in it.
You do? That's fantastic.
You want to see it?
I'd love to,
but I gotta get back to your parents.
They're telling us about
how they adopted you.
What?
What?
I'm adopted?
I got nothing.
Well, that first batch of margaritas was not so great...
...but this second batch is good.
Well, maybe the next batch,
we could all get some.
Oh, God, this is fun, isn't it?
You know, just the four of us.
Just hanging.
Dude, are you okay?
And when are the fajitas gonna be ready?
I'm fine, okay? I'm great.
I'm just--I'm just proud of us.
You know? There's no weirdness,
no tension.
No awareness.
We make a great foursome.
We should do more stuff together.
Let's take a trip!
Okay, where do you think we can go?
My fajitas!
Look, Charlie, I just want you to know...
...Ross is just having a little trouble
adjusting to the thought of Joey and me.
You know, he normally doesn't drink like this.
You know what, this is nothing.
My father is a raging alcoholic.
I'm sorry,
have I made this evening uncomfortable?
Fajitas! Be careful! Very hot plate! Very hot!
Ross, you don't even have oven mitts on.
That is gonna hurt tomorrow.
Okay, well, this is crazy.
We can't seriously be talking about
me taking one of your kids, can we?
Oh, no, of course we're not.
- That's insane. - I know.
Alice would never go for it.Right?
I don't know. She's pretty tired too.
I think we could get her on board.
Well, just for argument's sake, you know,
hypothetically...
...which one would you be willing to give up?
Frank Jr. Jr.?
You'd be getting a really good one.
He's really funny.
Like, the other day, he made up this joke:
What's green and says,
"Hey, I'm a frog"?
A talking frog.
Oh, no, you can't have him, he's too funny.
Well, all right, that's fine. What about Leslie?
Oh, no, no, not Leslie. No.
She's the only one that knows
how to burp the alphabet.
All right, so that leaves Chandler.
No, no, you can't have Chandler.
No, no. She's my little genius.
I got big hopes for her.
She's gonna be a doctor or a realtor.
Wow, Frank, I think we just ran out of kids.
Oh, I think you're right.
Oh, wow. Phoebe,
I don't think I can give one of them up.
I mean, you know, they drive me crazy,
but they're my babies.
I'm sorry, Frank,
I didn't realize things were so bad.
You know, I'll help out more.
I can baby-sit anytime you want.
You name the day and I'll be there.
How about tomorrow?
Well, that's not good.
But I can move some stuff around and I'll be there.
You and Alice just take the whole day together.
You'd do that for us?
Are you kidding?
That's what sisters are for.
Oh, look at them.
I love you so much.
Oh, crap, don't wake up...
Where are Bill and Colleen?
They are in the kitchen, getting something to eat.
Can you believe how nice they are?
We have to leave.
Why? What did you do in the bathroom?
I didn't get to the bathroom.
I bumped into Owen on the way.
He didn't know he was adopted.
There's a slight chance...
...l may have told him.
Oh, my God, where's my purse?
No, I can replace everything in there.
- Get that binder and let's go!  - Hi.
Some little snacks for everybody.
You don't have to eat the sour worms. Those are for Owen.
I'll go get him in a second.
By the way, you should know,
we haven't told him he's adopted yet.
But kids are so intuitive.
Don't you think, on some level, he already knows?
- I'm adopted?  - See? Intuitive.
What? Where did you hear that?
He told me.
And he paid me 50 dollars not to tell.
Which, technically, now you should give back.
You told him he's adopted?
I'm sorry.
But You should have a sign out there or something.
Or at least whisper it to people when they come in the door.
"Owen doesn't know he's adopted,
and he also thinks Santa is real."
He isn't?
We have to get out of here, baby.
Everyone, I would like to make a toast...
...to Rachel and Joey.
And to love.
Ah, love!
L-O-V-E. Love.
L is for "life."
And what is life without love?
Oh, my God, are we supposed to answer?
O is for...
"Oh, wow!"
The V is for this...
...very surprising turn of events...
...which I am still fine with, by the way.
E...
...is for how...
...extremely normal I find it...
...that you two...
...are together.
And that one day you might get married...
...and have children of your own.
- Dude, are you okay? - Totally.
Ross, you don't seem okay.
I'm sorry,
it must be the pressure of entertaining.
I think everyone would feel better if we had some flan.
Wait, Ross. Ross, l--I have to take off.
- No!  - I'm sorry.
I have an early class in the morning.
But this has been lovely.
Wasn't it? And you thought it would be awkward with Joey.
And that you never really liked Rachel.
You are on fire!
I'll call you in the morning, okay?
- Okay. - All right.
God, Rachel, what Ross just said, that's just--
That's okay. Girls tend not to like me.
Fine.
Okay. I guess it's just flan for three.
Hey, that rhymes.
You know what, Ross, I think we're gonna take off too.
Of course. God, I'm so stupid.
You guys are a couple now.
I mean, you probably just want to be alone.
No, it's just getting late--
It's fine. It's totally fine.
I've got plenty of margaritas. It's all good.
I don't even know what that's for.
You know what?
I think I'm gonna stay here and make sure he's okay.
That's probably a good idea.
I'll see you in the morning.
Okay.
Yeah, you know, Joey, l--
I don't think he's ever gonna
be okay with this.
It doesn't look good, does it?
Morning.
- Here you go.  - Thanks.
- Did you stay here all night?  - Yeah.
So you took off my pants and shoes?
No...
You actually did that when you  were
dancing to the Chicago soundtrack.
Look, Ross...
...about Rachel and l.
Listen, you don't have to worry about that...
...because nothing's gonna happen.
What do you mean?
She and I said from the beginning...
...we weren't gonna do anything
unless you were okay with it.
And clearly--
What are you talking about? I'm fine.
It's okay, Ross. You know, I totally understand.
Of course you're not fine. You're...
You're Ross and Rachel.
Yeah, except we're not.
I mean, we haven't been a couple in, like...
...six years.
My God, is that right?
Has it been that long?
That's what I hear, yeah.
This is crazy.I mean, six years...
...and because of me, you guys aren't gonna be together?
Can I ask you something?
Really...
...what is this thing with you and Rachel?
Come on, you know me. You know...
Joey.
I'm crazy about her.
And she feels the same way?
I think so.
Well, then...
...maybe it's time we all moved on.
Yeah, but, Ross, I mean, you're not okay with it, so--
No, but I want to be.
I will be.
Besides, I'm with Charlie, right?
Oh, my God, I'm still with Charlie, aren't l?
- She didn't see the dance, did she?  - No...
No, that was--That was just for me.
Hey, you...?
You sure about this?
Yeah, I'm sure.
And...
...we're okay?
- Hey, Pheebs. - Hey.
We just want to give you a heads up.
- Bill and Colleen hate us.  - Why?
Owen didn't know he's adopted
and Monica told him.
What?
Still, he had to find out sometime.
How would you like it
if someone told the triplets
that you gave birth to them?
I'm gonna go tell Emma
she was an accident.
- So you and Rachel tonight, huh? - Yeah.
Yeah, it's actually our first official date.
Wow, so tonight may be the night.
You nervous?
No. This is the part I'm actually good at.
What must it be like not to be crippled by fear and self-loathing?
It's okay.
How can you be so confident?
Well, I know exactly what I'm gonna do.
Really? Like, you have a routine?
No. See, each woman is different.
You have to appreciate their uniqueness.
- Really? - No, I do six things.
First, I look deep into her eyes,
then I kiss her.
Next, I take my hand
and I softly graze her thigh.
You mean like this?
No, not like that. No, no. No, like this:
I see what you mean.
That's quite nice.
- More foosball? - And beer.
Friends S10E03 The One With Ross's Tan
- Hey. - Hey.
Hey, sweetie.
Hey, stop staring at my wife's legs.
No, no. Stop staring at your sister's legs.
I'm sorry, it's just-- How'd you get so tan?
She went to one of those spray-on tan places.
You got a spray-on tan?
Chandler gets pedicures!
What? You do?
Like, with the toe separators?
Why? Why?
I can't believe that's sprayed on.
I mean, it looks really good.
I wonder if I should get one.
Sure, then you should get a miniskirt so you can really show it off.
So do you get colors or just French tips?
- Here. Here's their card. - Thanks.
Hey, I know where this place is.
It used to be an X-rated video--
Florist.
- Hey. - Hey, Pheebs.
You won't believe who moved back to town.
I know. Amanda.
She called me too. She's the worst.
Who's Amanda?
She's this girl who lived in the building
before you did.
Then she moved to England
and picked up this fake British accent.
On the machine, this is her message:
"Monica, darling, it's Amanda calling."
Are you trying to do a British accent?
Chandler gets pedicures.
Just so I know,
how many more of those can I expect?
Know what Amanda said
when she called me?
"Oh, so sorry to catch you on your mobile."
If-if you don't wanna get me on my mo-Bile,
don't call me on my mo-Bile.
I know. And she always brags about
all the famous people she's met.
Oh, I know!
"I slept with Billy Joel."
All right, who hasn't?
What are we gonna do?
I don't wanna see her.
Let's just cut her out.
- What? - Cut her out of our lives.
Just ignore her calls
and dodge her till she gets the point.
Well, I guess we could try that.
But it seems so harsh.
Have you ever done that?
No. Had it done to me, though.
Feels good.
All right, Mr. Geller, right this way.
So how dark do you wanna be?
We have one, two or three.
Well, I like how you look. What are you?
Puerto Rican.
Two. I think a two.
You'll face the red light.
When the light's on,
the spraying's about to start,
so close your eyes.
When the spraying stops, count to five...
...pat yourself to avoid drip marks,
then turn to get your back. Got it?
Spray, count, pat and turn.
Spray, count and pat.
You catch on quick.
Well, I have a Ph.D., so...
One Mississippi, two Mississippi, three--
Wait... I'm not--I'm not finished counting!
You sprayed my front twice!
You never turned?
No! I barely got to "three Mississippi"!
Mississippi? I said count to five.
Mississippi-less-ly?
Well, how bad is it?
Not that bad yet.
But it gets darker for the next four hours.
So how dark will it get?
You got sprayed with two twos and--
I'm a four?
Yeah, but your back's a zero.
You'll wanna even that out.
Really?
You might wanna get back in there.
Oh, okay!
Wait a minute,
there's no light on the back wall.
How do I know when it's gonna start? Hello?
My eyes!
The same thing happened again!
- You got two more twos? - I'm an eight!
Thanks for dinner.
I thought you paid.
Guess we won't be going back there.
- So... - Yeah.
Hey, what do you say
we move this onto the likes of the couch?
I say cheesy line, but okay.
- What's the matter? - I don't know. I'm sorry.
- I don't know why I did that. - Okay.
Sorry.
I'm sorry. Again,
I don't know what happened.
I must be nervous.
I don't get it. Chandler loved it.
I promise. I won't do it again.
I really do. This is gonna be great.
- Okay. - Okay.
Was that good for you?
No, don't get it. Let the machine pick up.
Yeah, it could be Rachel
asking if someone could babysit again.
- It could be Amanda. - Oh, you're right.
I was just kidding about Rachel.
Babysitting's a gas.
Hello, Monica. It's Amanda calling again.
I'm in the neighborhood,
hoping I could pop by your flat.
You're from Yonkers!
Your last name is Buffamonteezi!
Let's see. So should you get this directly...
...ring me back on my mobile.
Okay, don't hold thy breath.
Hello? Is someone on the line?
Yes. I was looking for Monica.
Hang on, she's right here.
Someone's on the phone for you.
We weren't picking up. It's Amanda.
I get pedicures.
Hi, Amanda.
Actually, now is not a good time.
Dinner tomorrow night?
Okay, Phoebe and I will see you then.
Why? Why? Why didn't you just say no?
Well, I said no to her coming over now.
I couldn't say no twice.
I got this uncontrollable need to please people.
Fine. Fine. You would not hold up well under torture.
- Oh, and you would? - I did.
- Rach, are you sure you wanna do this? - Absolutely.
It's just a little weird. It's you, and it's me.
- It'll just take some getting used to. - Okay.
Okay, well, how can we make it easier?
Okay. Let's work from the top down.
Just work the bra, Joe.
Okay, got it, yeah. Absolutely.
- Okay. - Okay.
- Is this thing welded shut? - Okay.
All right, turn around.
I gotta get a look at this thing.
Sorry.
Well, this is romantic.
I'm sorry.
This has never happened to me before.
I'm an expert at taking off bras.
I could do it with one hand.
I could do it with my eyes closed.
Once I just looked at one...
...and it popped open.
I blame your bra!
It's a standard issue bra clasp!
Then I blame you.
Yeah. That's right.
You threw me off with all your slapping.
Okay, look, I'm really sorry about that, Joey.
But do you think maybe, on some level,
you don't want to take off my bra?
No, I don't have another level.
Hold on. There's something different.
I went to that tanning place your wife suggested.
Was that place the sun?
Oh, and it gets worse.
Oh, my God, you can do a duet of
"Ebony and Ivory" all by yourself.
How could you mess this up?
It's so easy.
You go in the booth,
count to five and turn around.
How do you count to five?
One, two, three--
Damn it!
I know!
What is up with Miss Hawaiian Tropic?
How was your date with Joey?
Well, it was good,
until we got back to our apartment.
And then we were fooling around
and he started to put his hand up my leg...
...and I kept slapping it away.
You didn't like that?
Well, it wasn't just me, all right?
He freaked out too.
He couldn't even undo my bra.
Really? One time he just looked at my bra
and it popped open.
I do not know what's wrong with us.
We've kissed before and that's been great.
But this time it was leading somewhere...
...and I was very aware of the fact that it was Joey touching me.
You guys have been friends forever.
The first time you kissed Ross,
how weird that was.
You couldn't stop laughing.
You got through that.
Okay. That's true. That's true,
we can do this.
You're right. We can do this.
We'll just power through.
Chandler, can I talk to you for a second?
No need, problem solved.
We are powering through.
Chandler, stop. It's not going to pop open.
You don't know.
- Hi, Phoebe. - Hey.
- Is Amanda here yet? - No.
I'm sorry for screwing up
that "cutting her out" plan,
but I have a new plan.
Chandler will call in a few minutes
with an emergency.
Okay, what kind of emergency
gets us both out of here?
What do you think of Mike and Chandler
being in a car accident?
- Are you kidding? I love it! - Okay.
- Hi. - Hi.
Hello!
It's so nice to see you.
Both of you, look at me.
Look how young I look!
Oh, gosh, we have so much to catch up on.
But first things first. Touch my abs.
I don't exercise at all.
Oh, gosh. So, Monica, you're married.
Yeah, his name is Chandler and he's--
Oh, smell my neck.
It's not perfume.
It's me. It's my natural scent.
Musty.
Gosh, this is brilliant.
Gosh, it's just like old times.
I'm so happy you two are friends again.
When were we not friends?
Well, it was 1992.
And I remember, because that was the year
I had sex with Evel Knievel.
We were friends in 1992.
No, I distinctly remember you were dodging her calls...
...and trying to avoid seeing her.
You were going to cut me out?
Well, kind of.
- Oh, my God! - Oh, bugger.
Should I not have said that?
I feel like a perfect arse.
Well, in America, you're just an ass.
Hello?
Chandler, what's wrong?
Oh, my God, are you all right?
Yeah, I'll be right there.
I'm so sorry, but Chandler was in a car accident.
- Oh, my God. - Yeah.
- Was Mike with him? - Nope.
Got the champagne?
Yes. Ready to power through.
Excellent.
Stick it in the ice bucket,
the phone is off the hook...
...and, in the interest of powering through....
Okay, sexy...
...very sexy. Sexy. All right, let's do it!
Okay, you're scaring me a little bit.
Get over it, soldier, we gotta do this.
- Okay. You like that, huh? - Oh, yeah.
You like that? Let's kick this into high gear, huh?
Yeah, baby! I'll show you how we do it!
No...
You kneed me in my misters!
What? Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.
Joey? Are you okay?
Soldier down.
We are not friends with Phoebe anymore.
If she asks, I protested a little, but okay.
Chandler, thank God you're alive.
Monica, can I talk to you outside?
I have nothing to say to you.
My flat is twice this size.
Please, Monica, in the hall?
Oh, that accident must have been terrible.
You look positively ghastly.
Well, aren't you a treat.
I can't believe you tried to cut me out.
Why, Phoebe? Why?
It was right after we were living together...
...and you were driving me crazy, okay?
You were really controlling
and compulsive and shrill.
Well, I'm still all those things!
You're also so generous
and kind and scrappy.
I am scrappy.
Exactly. No matter what I tried to do,
I couldn't keep you out of my life.
Of all the people I've cut out...
...you were the only one
who ever clawed her way back in.
That's because I'm scrappy.
Yeah, you are,
and I'm so glad
that you fought your way back in...
...because I don't know what I would do without you.
I don't know what I would do without you.
Well, I guess we should go back in.
I mean, you gave me another chance.
We should do the same for Amanda.
Yeah, I guess you're right.
Can you believe it?
I've never had any professional dance training.
Now, let me explain how this works.
You go into the booth and--
I'm gonna stop you right there, Glenda. Okay?
Does it look like this is my first time?
Now, I want four two's,
and I want them all on my back.
Okay.
Wait. There's two sets of nozzles!
Which one is it? Which one is it?
Oh, son of a bitch!
What is the matter with us?
Well, I know what's the matter with me.
No, I mean with us, you know?
I mean, is it supposed to be this...
...difficult?
I don't know.
That fake British woman's a real bitch,
but she sure can dance.
- Hey. - Hi.
Hey, listen, can I ask you a question?
When you and Monica first hooked up...
...was it weird going from friends to more than that?
Kind of.
Sneaking around, having to hide from you guys--
No, no, no. No, I mean...
...sexually.
Yeah, was there a part of you that felt like it was...
...really wrong?
Actually, no. No, it felt right, you know?
If felt like,
"l can't believe we haven't been doing this
the whole time."
I can tell from your expressions
that's the good news you were hoping for.
Well,
I'm gonna go continue to spread the joy.
Just because it happened that way for them
doesn't mean it has to for us.
Yeah. Yeah, absolutely.
I mean, just because something's difficult
doesn't mean that you quit.
- Right, totally. - Yeah. And so...
...we'll just keep trying and trying
until we do it.
If not, we'll just be
a couple that never has sex.
That's a plan.
- I did not see this coming. - I know.
I don't know, I don't get it.
I mean, I was so sure this is what I wanted.
Me too.
Well, how come Monica and Chandler could do it?
I guess they weren't
as good friends as we are.
I bet you're right.
So...
Yeah.
I love you.
Love you too.
- All right, I'm going to bed. - Yeah, me too.
Yeah. I'm not going anywhere for a while.
Dude, it's Chandler. Let me in.
Go away!
I don't wanna see anybody!
I know, I went to the tanning place
and the same thing happened to me.
You have to let me in.
Really?
Did you count Mississippi-ly?
You're not tan.
No. I just had to get a picture of this.
I'll see you later.
- Hey, guys. - Hey.
Honey, I got us that room
at the Woodford lnn this weekend.
That place in Vermont? You can take a hint.
You can't go away this weekend.
It's Emma's birthday.
We're having a party.
Can't you have the party when we get back?
No. It won't be her real birthday.
Gee, if only she were 1
and had no idea what the hell a birthday was.
Come on, you guys, this is really important to us.
Sorry, but Chandler and l could really
use a weekend away...
...you know, to reconnect, emotionally.
There's this thing I really want us to do.
I read about it in Maxim.
Well, can't you just go to Vermont the next day?
Yeah, we want everyone to be there.
As much as I hate to delay your doing
weird sex stuff to my little sister.
And, I mean, you know, you guys, this is a big deal.
How can we have her first birthday party
without her aunt and her uncle?
All right, we'll stay.
We can just drive up after the party.
Fine. But if we end up
not doing this Maxim thing because of this party--
Believe me, that is not why we won't be doing that.
Friends S10E04 The One With The Cake
You know, Pheebs,
when I was little, on my birthday...
...my daddy would hide a present
in every room of the house.
And then he would draw a treasure map
to help me find them all.
I love family traditions like that.
When Ursula and I were kids,
on our birthday...
...our stepdad would sell his blood
to buy us food.
- Hey, guys. - Hi.
I brought the camera for Emma's video.
Oh, good!
We had this idea to make a birthday video for Emma...
...and we'll give it to her when she's 18.
Oh, cool.
- Wow, it's like a time capsule. - Yeah.
Oh, just think, she's gonna be watching that video on a TV...
...that hasn't even been invented yet...
...with friends who, right now, are just, like, babies.
And they'll be living in a floating city that the humans built...
...to escape the ant people.
That's the hope.
So is Emma awake yet?
No, it's still naptime.
But she'll be up soon.
Where's Joey?
I said, it's still naptime.
- Hey, there's Uncle Joey. - Hey.
Hey, say something to Emma on her 18th birthday.
- Eighteen, huh? - Joey, no!
What? What? It's for her hot friends.
When they see this, you'll be 52.
And starting to think about settling down.
Joey, will you please set this up for people
to put Emma's presents on?
Love to. Yeah.
We were supposed to bring presents?
Yeah. I wrote Emma a song.
Oh, yeah. How was I supposed to know?
Joey, it's a birthday party.
Yeah, but for a 1-year-old.
What's the point?
The other day she laughed for an hour at a cup.
Just a cup with a picture of Elmo on it, dressed as a farmer.
And he's standing next to this cow, and the cow says, "El-moo."
Man, that's a funny cup.
- Hey. - Hey.
Where's the birthday girl?
Oh, she's still napping.
She was probably up all night excited about the party
she knows is happening.
I know you guys really want to get to Vermont,
and this isn't a big deal to you.
But it really is to us, okay?
Emma will never have a first birthday again.
You're right. We're sorry.
Let's wake up Emma
and get the fun time started!
She didn't sleep well last night, so we can't wake her.
Are you frigging kidding me, Greene?
- Hi! - Hey!
I'm so glad you came.
I can't believe Emma's already 1.
I remember your first birthday.
Ross was jealous of all the attention we were giving you.
He pulled on his testicles so hard...
...we had to take him to the emergency room.
There's something you didn't know about your dad.
Hey, Mr. And Mrs. Geller.
Let me help you with that.
- Thank you. - Oh, man, this is great, huh?
The three of us together again.
You know what would be fun?
If we gave this present
to Emma from all of us.
Which one are you?
I can't believe Emma's still asleep.
I know. What are we gonna do?
I've got a plan. I've got a plan.
I'm going to ram this platter
really hard into your ribs.
You're gonna scream out,
and that'll wake her up.
I'm not going to Vermont with this Monica.
Hey, Pheebs? You know what?
I was thinking since you wrote a song...
...maybe I could do something for Emma using my talents.
So you're gonna hit on her?
No, no, no. My talents as an actor.
You know, I could, like, maybe....
I could do a dramatic reading of one of her books.
Or you could stick a fork in an apple.
Hey, I think Emma might like it.
Oh, Emma might like what?
- My present. - What did you get her?
We prepared performances.
Separate performances.
But equally real.
That sounds like fun.
People are getting a little antsy
waiting for Emma to wake up from her nap.
So would you mind performing them once now?
- Sure, yeah! - Okay.
Okay. All right. Everybody, let's get this party started.
Joey and Phoebe are gonna perform a little something for us.
Oh, great.
Aren't you gonna be embarrassed
having nothing prepared?
I do it every week
with three cameras pointed at me
and a whole crew waiting.
So, Joey, what are you gonna do for us?
I will be doing a dramatic reading of one of Emma's books.
Oh, okay. Which one?
Well, it's one of her favorites.
"Riding the Storm Out: Coping With Postpartum Depression."
Love You Forever.
"Love You Forever, by Robert Munsch.
Published by Firefly Books. Printed...
...in Mexico.
A mother held her new baby
and very slowly rocked him...
...back and forth,
back and forth, back and forth.
And while she held him, she sang,
I'll love you forever.
I'll like you for always.
As long as I'm living...
...my baby you'll be.
"And while he rocked her, he sang:
I'll love you forever.
I'll like you for always.
As long as I'm living...
...my baby you'll be.
Oh, wow!
That was amazing.
Thank you so much for that gift.
I was not ready for this today.
- Amazing. Amazing. - Phoebe, I'm sorry.
Phoebe has prepared something as well.
That's right.
I prepared a song for Emma,
from my heart to hers.
For there's no greater gift than the gift of music.
Emma Your name poses a dilemma
'Cause not much else rhymes with "Emma"
Maybe the actor Richard Crenna
He played the commanding officer in Rambo
Happy birthday, Emma
Is that it?
No, of course not.
No, I've also, you know, prepared a reading.
"Sex and the Single Mother."
- "Finding your G-spot." - Oh, no, no, no!
Hello, Emma. Happy 18th birthday.
Right now, that seems so far away, 17 years.
Yes. You'll be all grown up by then,
and we'll be....
Well, your grandfather and l might not be here.
That's true. This message could be coming to you...
...from beyond the grave, Emma.
After all, my parents died very young.
And my cholesterol's off the charts.
Remember, Emma,
heart disease kills women too.
Okay, cut! Great. Great. That was just....
Oh, good.
Ross, don't forget to get a shot of Emma's cake.
- It's in a box in the fridge. - Okay, sure.
You're gonna love this cake.
I got it from a bakery in New Jersey,
Carino's.
Oh, my God, that place has the creamiest frosting!
I used to hitchhike there when I was a kid.
Well, anyway,
they make these great novelty cakes...
...in all different shapes.
And if you give them a photo,
they'll copy it in icing.
Did you do a picture of Emma?
Yes. On a cake shaped like a bunny.
Rach?
Does this bakery by any chance also bake...
...erotic cakes?
Say, for bachelorette parties?
Ross, what are you talking--? Oh, my God!
They put my baby's face on a penis!
Now it's a party!
Wait, you guys, this isn't funny.
If I wanted this cake to be a disaster,
I would have baked it myself!
Is it okay
that I still think it looks delicious?
Jack, look at this.
I know what you're thinking, Judy.
The resemblance is uncanny.
I am this close to tugging on my testicles again.
No, no, this is not what I ordered, okay?
I went all the way to New Jersey
so that I could have the perfect cake...
...for my daughter's birthday. And I need a bunny cake right now!
Ask them if it would be faster
if we cut the baby's face off the penis...
...so we could put it on the bunny.
That is a weird sentence.
Oh, believe you me, I am going to bring this cake back.
I don't even want it in my home.
Joey. Don't touch it!
I'm so confused!
Yes, I still want my daughter's picture,
but on a bunny cake!
Yellow cake, chocolate frosting with nuts!
To be fair, this one does have nuts.
Mon, it was nice of you to loan Rachel your car...
...so she could get the cake.
It was nice of her to pull my hair...
...till I dropped the key.
Well, while we're waiting,
you could tape your message to Emma...
...for her 18th birthday, huh? Okay?
Hi, Emma. It's the year 2020.
Are you still enjoying your nap?
We're Aunt Monica and Uncle Chandler, by the way.
You may not recognize us...
...because we haven't spoken
to your parents in 17 years.
We used to be married.
But then we missed a weekend away together,
and things kind of unraveled...
...because of you.
Happy birthday.
Ross, Rachel promised
it would be over by now.
We seriously have to go
if we want to get to Vermont.
I called them,
the last train leaves in a half-hour.
And I have a massage client soon.
You guys, just, please, a little bit longer.
I promise,
Rachel will be back with the cake any minute.
Monica, remember the frosting, huh?
All right, five more minutes.
Hello?
Oh, no, what happened?
Okay, okay, where are you?
Okay, I'll be right there.
Was that Emma?
Is she up?
Rachel got pulled over for speeding.
She forgot her license.
I have to bring it to her.
If you're leaving, I'm definitely going.
Wait, if anybody gets to go, it's us!
We've been complaining the longest!
No, wait, you guys. No, you can't leave.
Rachel already feels bad that the cake's messed up.
How do you think she'll feel
when she comes back and you're gone?
I don't know. You'll tell us on Monday.
Joey, you're in charge, okay?
You make sure nobody leaves.
Got it!
Hey! Where do you think you're going?
To the bathroom.
Well, the rest of you get comfortable,
because we are gonna be here for a--
Wait, there's a window in there.
No! He's not getting away that easy!
What are you doing?
Get the hell out of here!
Well, that one did not have Emma's face on it.
- No, it did not. - No.
Well, we'd better get going. It's late.
Jack can't drive at night anymore.
He has trouble staying in his lane.
Last winter I went up on a church lawn
and drove right through a manger scene.
The papers thought it was a hate crime.
- Anyway, it was lovely seeing you. - Okay.
- Bye. Bye, dear. - Nighty-night.
- Nighty-night. - Bye.
How could you just let them leave?
Hey, hey, hey.
I'm not gonna mess with Jack.
He's a great man. He fought for our country.
No, he didn't.
He pretended to be a Quaker
to get out of Korea.
Well, that's it. He's the last one to go.
I'm locking you guys in.
You do know I can just turn them
the other way around, right?
Oh, I forgot you used to live here.
- Hello? - Joey, it's Estelle.
- Hey. - So how'd your audition go today?
What audition?
The one I told you about last week.
What? You never said anything about an audition.
Let me start over.
I just got a call about an audition.
I think you can still make it.
It's down at the Astor Theater,
and you need to have a monologue prepared.
A monologue? I don't have a--
I got it.
So I'm gonna take off.
What?
No, wait! You don't get to leave.
I've got a massage client waiting outside my door any minute.
And we paid for a room
that we're supposed to be in right now!
Well, okay, now...
...only one of us has to stay with Emma.
Okay, and as the person who realized that, I get to go.
No...
Let's figure out a fair way to decide who's staying.
Oh, I got it.
Okay, everyone pick a number from one to 10, all right?
Whoever gets the highest number gets to go first.
Okay, 10.
Okay, Monica picks 10. I call nine.
Anyone else?
- No, let's just draw straws. - Okay.
Or we could flip a coin and multiply the answer--
- I'm begging you to stop. - Right.
Okay, how about this?
We got wind-up toys for Emma.
We can make them race,
and whoever comes in last stays.
Yeah, let's do that!
That sounds more fun than the thing
we were gonna do in Vermont!
Okay, everybody, pick your toys!
Okay. I want the dolphin!
- That's a bear! - I'm too excited!
Phoebe, you get the bear.
Joey, you get the robot.
Oh, yeah.
And Chandler and I get the dog.
And the race is going to go from here to here.
Now, the one who comes in last stays!
Okay, ladies and gentlemen,
wind your toys.
Okay. On your mark, get set, go!
Go! Go!
Come on, robot!
What are you barking at?
Well, how is that gonna help?
I bought you!
How did I forget that that's all you do?
Way to go, robot!
Good job, Alan.
Hey, good race, you guys.
Yeah, see you later.
No. No, no. Wait.
We didn't lose.
The rules clearly stated that
the last one to cross the finish line was the loser.
Well, our dog never crossed
the finish line. So technically--
They left.
There isn't time to go to the bakery.
We're gonna come home.
Everybody left?
All right. Well, just tell Emma
that we'll be there as soon as we can. Bye.
- Rachel! - Oh, God, sorry!
I can't believe they gave you a ticket.
You're such a good driver.
- Emma's awake. - Yeah?
I can't believe this.
This is her first birthday,
she's awake, we're not even there.
Everybody left.
We still have this stupid obscene cake.
Hey, maybe I can fix that.
You know, try to turn it into something else.
Oh, don't even bother.
We've already ruined her first birthday.
And do you know
how important these early experiences are,
Ross? Very!
According to the back cover of that book that you gave me.
Rach, she's not gonna remember this.
I guess.
Oh, I just had such an idea
of what this day would be like, you know?
Emma laughing...
...and everybody gathered around her cake,
singing "Happy Birthday."
And then we would all--
Hey, get out of the road,
you stupid student driver!
They have to learn.
- Hey. - What?
This is not bad.
Oh, my God. Look, you made it into a bunny.
How did you do that?
Well, I just made these two things cheeks.
And then I split this to make ears.
Well, I am very impressed.
Some can sing, some can dance.
I, apparently, can turn phallic cakes
into woodland creatures.
Now, another way to organize your stuffed animals
is by size.
I'm sorry, is this a game
for Emma or for Monica?
Game?
Emma, do you even know it's your birthday today?
You're 1.
One year old. That's little.
That's my girl.
That's how old you are.
Did I teach her that?
Did I just impart wisdom?
I want one.
Me too.
There's no one around.
Why don't we just take this one?
- And head to Canada. - I was kidding.
I wasn't. Let's get going.
Hey, are Ross and Rachel back?
No, not yet.
Oh, good, I didn't miss the party.
What about your massage client?
I just felt so bad missing this.
So I just slipped him a little something, you know.
As long as I'm back in five or six hours,
it'll be all right.
Okay.
If Ross and Rachel ask,
I've been here the whole time. The whole time.
I've been here the whole time.
Joey, we just saw you come in.
You ran past us on the stairs.
I don't care that you left.
I'm just glad that you're here.
Thanks, you guys.
Hey, guys, come on.
You gotta see what Emma just did.
- What? - Emma, how old are you?
How old are you today?
Emma, that's right. You're that many.
Oh, my God, our daughter's a genius.
- This means-- - No! No science camp!
Damn it! I'll put a candle on the cake.
Oh, and, Emma, look at your stuffed animals
lined up so neatly.
Thanks.
Okay, here we go.
Emma's first birthday cake.
Go ahead, Emma, blow out the candle.
Come on, Emma. You can do it.
What's wrong? Are you okay?
Oh, yeah, nothing.
These are happy tears.
This is just what I wanted.
Hey, you made it into a bunny.
What is wrong with me?
It looked more delicious when it was a penis.
- Okay, you ready? - Yeah.
- And record. - Okay.
Hi, Emma.
Well, your first birthday is over, and--
Go! Go! Come on!
Go! Go! Come on!
Go! Go, Alan! Run, you hairy bastard!
You know, I'm thinking about letting Emma have her first cookie.
Her first cookie?
She has cookies all the time.
I've never given her a cookie.
- Have you? - No.
No. And for the record,
I've also never given her frosting from a can.
Hey, Rach, the adoption agency needs letters of recommendation...
...and we wondered if you would write one for us?
Of course. I would be honored.
Thank you.
I think there's been an oversight.
We would have asked you.
We thought you wouldn't be interested.
It's just that we don't think of you
as really being so much with the words.
Clearly, we were wrong.
I got a lot of nice stuff
to say about you guys, okay?
I know how much you want to have a baby...
...and I would love to help you get one.
You know what? Joey. Then we want you to do it.
Thank you. All right. Let me see how I'm gonna start.
"Dear Baby Adoption Decider People...."
So excited about your letter.
- Hey. - Hey, Phoebe.
- Wow, don't you look nice. - Yes, I do.
Today's Mike and my one-year anniversary.
What's it the anniversary of?
Your first date, your first kiss, first time you had sex?
Yeah.
So you must be going somewhere fancy to celebrate.
A Knicks game.
Aren't you a little overdressed?
I've never had a one-year anniversary before...
...so no matter where we go, I'm wearing something fancy...
...I'm gonna put on my finest jewelry...
...and we're gonna have sex in a public restroom.
You guys do that?
Chandler won't even have sex in our bathroom.
That's where people make number two.
Friends S10E05 The One Where Rachel's Other Sister Babysits
So, you know, I have a little time
if you want to....
I'd love to, but I really have to grade these papers.
Fine. It's fine.
I'll just shower by myself.
B...
You gave a B to a Pottery Barn catalog.
Well, it had some good ideas.
Take off your shirt.
- Damn it. - Rachel, open up! It's your sister!
I have to talk to you.
Hi, Amy.
- You're not Rachel. - Still sharp as a tack.
Charlie, this is Rachel's sister Amy.
Amy, this is Charlie.
- Hi. Nice to meet you. - Hi, hi.
And you are?
Ross? I grew up on your block?
We had Thanksgiving together last year?
I had a baby with your sister?
No. I....
Did I buy a falafel from you yesterday?
Yes. Yes, you did.
Hi, Rachel. Here's your sister Amy.
She thinks I need pec implants.
Amy? Hi.
- You remember Joey. - Yeah. Hey, sure.
- The Days of our Lives guy. - That's right, yeah.
You are not good.
Always nice to meet a fan.
So, now, what are you doing here?
Well, I have huge news.
Sorry, hold on. Let me check on the baby.
This is important. Can't Ella wait?
Her name is Emma.
Why did you change it?
Ella was so much prettier.
What do I know?
I just sell Middle Eastern food from a cart.
Hey, your English is getting better.
- Oh, my God. - I know.
She may be the hottest girl I've ever hated.
What you working on?
Monica and Chandler's recommendation.
I want it to sound smart,
but I don't know any big words or anything.
Why don't you use your thesaurus?
What did I just say?
Watch.
Here, highlight the word you want to change,
go under "tools" ...
...and the thesaurus generates-- Gives.
Gives a whole list of choices.
You can pick the word that sounds smartest.
My God, that's great. I'm smart.
No, no, I'm:
"Brainy, bright, clever." I love this thing!
Look out, ladies!
Joey Tribbiani's got the whole package!
God...
...so beautiful.
I know, isn't she?
No, I was talking about your bedding.
All right, what's your news, Amy?
Well...
...I'm getting married.
Wow! Oh, my God!
- To who? - This guy.
He has a killer apartment.
- And...? - And it's on Fifth.
And the elevator opens up right into the living room.
- No, what's he like? - Oh, he's okay.
Do you remember my old boyfriend Mark?
- Yeah. - It's his dad.
- Wow, so he's gotta be-- - Old? Yeah.
But he travels a lot,
so he's hardly ever there.
Sweetie, I gotta tell you,
it sounds a little bit like...
...you like the apartment more than you like--
Myron.
Yeah, I told you he was old.
Sit down.
Honey, you know...
...l once also almost married somebody that I didn't love.
- Do you remember Barry? - Remember him?
God, we used to make out all the time after you went to sleep.
Sometimes just nodding is okay.
But anyway, listen.
Not marrying Barry was the best decision that I ever, ever made.
Honey, Amy, you deserve true love.
Your soul mate is out there somewhere.
Someone that is your age, that is smart, that is fun...
...and that you care about.
You're right.
- You're right. I'm gonna do it. - Okay.
I'm gonna marry Myron
and keep looking for Mr. Right.
Okay, let's keep talking.
Excuse me. Anniversary.
Excuse me. Anniversary.
Sir, could you move your nachos?
They're in my seat.
It's my anniversary.
Here we are.
I can't believe it's been a whole year.
I know.
This has been the best year....
This has been the best year of my life!
Me too!
I never thought I could love someone this much!
I feel the same way!
You're so generous and kind,
and you're amazing in bed!
It's our anniversary.
Knicks fans, please turn your attention
to the big screen on the scoreboard.
Someone has a special question to ask.
How lame. It's so tacky and impersonal.
Really?
It's the worst way to propose.
Excuse me.
I finished my recommendation. Here.
And I think you'll be very, very happy.
It's the longest I ever spent on a computer
without looking at porn.
I don't understand.
Some of the words a little too sophisticated for you?
It doesn't make any sense.
Well, of course it does.
It's smart. I used a thesaurus.
On every word?
Yep.
All right, what was this sentence originally?
"They are warm, nice people with big hearts."
And that became,
"They are humid, prepossessing Homo sapiens...
...with full-sized aortic pumps."
Yeah. Yeah. And hey, I really mean it, dude.
All right, Joey, I don't think we can use this.
- Why not? - Well, because you signed it:
"Baby Kangaroo Tribbiani."
Why don't you stop worrying about sounding smart
and just be yourself.
You don't need a thesaurus. Just write from here.
Your full-sized aortic pump.
- Amy. Hi. - I took your advice.
- I left Myron. - Good for you!
I know. I'm Erin Brockovich.
Yes, you are.
- I'm so proud of you. - Thank you.
So can I stay with you?
But Erin Brockovich had her own house.
Look who's back.
Why do you have bags?
Rach,why does she have bags?
I'm staying with you guys.
- What? - We're gonna be roomies!
Come on.
- You slept out here? - Yeah.
Amy kept kicking me in her sleep,
yelling, "Myron, get off!"
But we're getting rid of her, right?
Rachel,please tell me we're getting rid of her?
- Joey, I can't do that. - Oh, come on.
Last night I was finishing off a pizza,
and she said
"A moment on the lips, forever on the hips."
I don't need that kind of talk in my house!
Joey, look, I know that she's difficult...
...but I think it's really good that she's here.
Because we'll appreciate it more when she's gone?
No, it's just-- Look, when I first moved to this city,
I was a lot like her.
I was spoiled, self-centered.
And you guys really took care of me.
Yeah. Monica made us.
Well, whatever. I really appreciate it...
...because I don't think I would be the person I am today...
...if it wasn't for you guys.
So I want to help Amy
the way you guys helped me.
And I know it's gonna take patience,
but that's okay.
- Good morning. - Yeah.
That's what I'm wearing today.
That's why I hung it on the door.
Oh, sweetie, you can't pull this off.
You know what?
I was thinking that maybe now would be a good time...
...for us to sit down and, you know, talk about your future.
Oh, I can't, honey.
I'm gonna go get my eyebrows shaped.
I am not happy.
Sure you want to eat that?
I'm curvy and I like it!
- Hi. - Hi.
I just had the worst anniversary ever.
I doubt that.
Tell her about us last year.
Well, I bought Chandler a $500 watch,
and he wrote me a rap song.
- Seriously? - Word.
Mine was worse than that.
Well, what happened?
We were at the game.
This guy proposed to his girlfriend on the big screen thing.
That is so tacky.
Well, that's what I said.
But it turns out Mike was planning on
proposing to me the same way last night.
Oh, my God. Mike was gonna propose?
That's huge.
Do you want to marry him?
Yeah, I really do. Yes.
But after I dumped on the way he was gonna do it...
...l don't think he'll ever ask again.
I said no in Barbados, and now this?
She's right. If I were a guy and....
Did I just say, "lf I were a guy"?
You don't need him to propose to you.
Maybe you could propose to him.
Oh, I don't know.
I don't know. Isn't that a little desperate?
I proposed to Chandler.
All right, moving on.
I don't think it was desperate.
It was amazing.
Thank you.
Well, do you think I should propose?
I think it could be kind of great.
Absolutely.
You'll love the feeling.
There's nothing like it.
Okay. Okay. So how should I do it?
How about at a game on the big screen?
How about at a Foot Locker?
What? What, he obviously thinks
that's a nice way to be proposed to.
Plus, he'd never suspect it.
Yeah, that does make sense.
Okay, now, would you two like that?
Sounds good to me.
But what would a guy think?
- Nana's on the phone. - Wow.
That's interesting,
since she died seven years ago.
She did?
Who got her condo in Boca?
Hello?
It's our nanny.
Hi.
Oh, God, I hope you feel better. Okay. Bye.
That's Molly. She's sick.
Can you watch Emma today?
I can't. I have back-to-back classes.
Did Molly say what she had?
Because my throat's been hurting.
Menstrual cramps.
I don't think that's what this is.
Can any of you watch Emma?
No, I'm sorry, sweetie.
No, I've got work, and then I'm proposing.
Great. Shoot. What am I gonna do?
Well, I could do it.
Well, actually....
Can I talk to you for a second?
I do not want her babysitting our child.
Why not?
For one thing, she keeps calling her Ella.
Ella's a nice name.
Fine, we'll call the next one Ella.
- The next one? - Okay.
I don't want her watching our baby.
Ross, I am trying to help her become a better person.
This is a huge breakthrough for her.
She just offered to do something
for another human being.
You know, I don't know.
Ross, I'm telling you...
...she's giving up getting her eyebrows shaped to do this, all right?
Do you understand
how important that is in our world?
Listen, I couldn't help but overhear,
because I was trying to.
Listen, let me do this.
I really want to help you guys out.
And plus, Rachel's been so wonderful to me.
- Absolutely. - Oh, great!
So how much does it pay?
Hi,Joe.
How's the second draft of the letter coming?
Great. I'm finished.
In fact, I just dropped it off at the agency.
- You dropped it off? - Yeah.
Can we read it?
Can you print out another copy?
No can do, amigo.
No, I didn't use the computer.
It felt more personal to handwrite it.
- You handwrote it? - Yeah, and don't worry.
I didn't try to sound smart at all.
See you later.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
That letter is gonna go in our file.
We're never gonna get a kid.
We're gonna be one of those old couples...
...that collects orchids or has a lot of birds.
It's okay. You know what?
I will just call the agency
and tell them to throw out the letter.
Okay, good.
Hello, this is Chandler Bing.
Someone just dropped off
a handwritten recommendation letter and....
Okay.
Thank you. Goodbye.
We're screwed, aren't we?
You know what?
Just tell me on the way to the bird store.
- They loved it. - What?
They thought it was very smart of us
to have a child write the letter.
They thought Joey was a child?
She guessed 8, 9, based on his drawings.
- Hi. - Hey, what'd you guys do today?
Ella wanted to go out,
so we went shopping and got some sushi.
- That sounds like fun. - Yeah, not really.
Babies are dull.
- Hey. Hi, how's my girl? - I'm fine.
And I got you a present
for letting me stay with you.
- Ready? - Yeah.
You pierced her ears?
Doesn't it make her nose look smaller?
You pierced her ears?
How could you do this without telling me?
If I had told you,
then it wouldn't have been a surprise, now would it?
I think she looks cute.
But I am wrong.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Here comes Ross.
He's gonna flip out.
Why, did something happen
to his falafel cart?
- Hey, guys. - Ross!
Hi, Emma.
Why is she wearing her hat so low?
She can barely see.
I don't really want her to see.
Why not?
Because there are so many terrible sights in this world.
Like war. Or that thing in Joey's refrigerator. Remember?
It was in a milk carton, but it looked like meat?
Come here.
There she is. Hi.
- What? - Nothing.
Hi.
What--?
Please tell me those are clip-ons!
Oh, they're real.
Did she do this to her?
I told you
we shouldn't have left Emma with her!
I know, I know. And you were right, Ross.
Okay? You are so irresponsible!
I am never letting you babysit again!
You know what? This kid needs me, okay?
She needs to have a cool, fun aunt.
I'm a cool, fun aunt.
Okay.
Hey! Monica can be cool and fun
at organized indoor projects.
All I wanted to do was help you
try to figure out what to do with your life.
This is how you repay me?
I don't need you to help me.
Because I already know what I'm gonna do with my life.
- Oh, yeah? Since when? - Since today.
I am going to be a baby stylist.
- What? - That's not a thing!
Well, it should be.
I'm gonna help babies learn how to accessorize...
...what colors to wear,
what clothes are slimming.
Babies don't care if they're slim!
Enter Amy.
Amy, l-- I just-- I just wanna--
What? What are you gonna do?
No more falafel for you!
Great game, huh?
Why do you keep looking at the screen?
I'm not. I'm praying.
Please let the Knicks win.
Thank you, Thor.
Where are you going?
I'm going to the bathroom.
Well, I think you should wait.
Why?
Well, if you don't hold it in,
you don't get all the nutrients.
Knicks fans, please turn your attention
to the big screen on the scoreboard.
Someone has a special question to ask.
Mike Hannigan, will you marry me?
Get a load of this. She's proposing to him!
Guess we know who wears the pants in that family.
Well, that's not very enlightened.
Boo us? Boo you!
Hello? Yeah, this is Joey Tribbiani.
Oh, hi.
Well, I'm glad you liked my letter.
No, my mommy and daddy aren't home right now.
Okay, bye-bye.
She was nice.
Joey, get Amy's bags. She is moving out.
You're kicking me out?
You put holes in my baby's ears.
At least now people will know she's a girl!
I can't believe I ever even tried to help you.
- You are so beyond help! - You know what?
Ever since I got here, you have been nothing but negative.
- Excuse me? - You didn't want me...
...to marry the old guy with the great apartment.
Then I tried to help your daughter de-emphasize her flaws...
...and suddenly I'm the bad guy?
Joey, where are those bags?
She has a lot of crap!
You know? When I moved in here,
I thought, "This will be so great.
Just us sisters back together again like when we were kids."
Except without that stupid Jill.
Who has gotten fat, by the way.
Seriously?
Mom said she gained, like, 15 pounds.
- Hips or thighs? - Ass and face.
Oh, my God! I thought she was on Atkins.
She was. Carbs found her.
See? This is what I wanted.
Two sisters talking about real stuff.
Oh, I can give you that.
- You can? - Yeah.
I kept trying to make you a better person, but you're....
You're already a pretty perfect version of what you are.
Thank you.
You gotta admit, Emma does look cute.
Did you just say, "Emma"?
Oh, I'm sorry. Ella.
That woman didn't know what she was talking about, Mike.
Obviously, you have balls.
Please, let's forget the whole thing.
I would love it.
Consider it forgotten.
Thank you.
But just so you know....
However and whenever you decide to propose,
I promise I'll say yes.
Whether, you know, it's at a basketball game...
...or in skywriting...
...or, you know, like some lame guy in a cheesy movie...
...who hides it in the cake.
It's in the cake, isn't it?
Where else would lame Mr. No Balls hide it?
What's the matter with me?
Why do I keep ruining this?
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
No, it's my fault.
I keep trying to propose in these stupid ways...
...and I just wanna tell you I love you,
and I wanna spend my life with you....
I'm gonna do this now.
Oh, my God.
Phoebe, l--
Wait. Oh, wait.
Oh, no.
Okay.
Ready? Okay.
Phoebe, I love you.
There's no one else in the world
I would ask to marry me three times.
But I want to take care of you...
...have babies with you...
...and grow old with you.
Phoebe Buffay, will you marry me?
Yes.
- I love you. - I love you more.
Not possible.
She's gonna be Mrs. No Balls!
So how's the baby-styling business going?
Not that great.
It's almost as if people don't want
to hear that their babies are ugly.
That's shocking.
There's Ross. Hey, Ross.
Hello, Ross?
He's rude.
- Hey. - Hi.
Pheebs, what's wrong?
I'm just so exhausted from dragging around
this huge engagement ring.
Oh, my God.
Congratulations.
So did he get on one knee?
Did he have a speech prepared?
Oh, did he cry?
Yeah, big surprise, I like proposals.
Well, it was really sweet,
and, like, the most romantic thing ever.
Here's to Phoebe,
who's found the greatest guy in the world.
To Phoebe and--
I want to say "Mike"?
To Phoebe and Mike.
Thank you.
Oh, and I have something for you.
It's my little black book.
It's got the numbers of all the guys I've dated.
Oh, Phoebe, that's nice,
but you know what? I think I'm okay.
Why don't you just give it
to one of your other single girlfriends.
I would, but you're the last one.
Give me the book!
"Pablo Diaz.
Brady Smith.
Guy in Van"?
Oh, my first love.
What is the red X next to
Bob Gremore's name mean?
Dead.
Oh, it's okay. No, he was old. Yeah.
And he lived a full life.
He was in the first wave at Omaha Beach.
oh, I'm sorry. I should've given you guys my black book
when I got married.
Although, it wasn't so much a book
as a napkin.
With Janice's phone number on it.
Phoebe, isn't Jethro Tull a band?
Oh, yes, they are.
Friends S10E06 The One With Ross's Grant
Hey, honey.
Hey, sweetie.
- Is Monica not here? - No.
Then I'll tell you.
My agency was bidding for a big account, and they got it.
It's my first national commercial.
Cool.
And I don't want to brag,
but a lot of the ideas were mine.
Hell, you weren't there.
All the ideas were mine.
That's great.
Hey, can you cast me in it?
I really don't think you're right for the part.
What do you mean? I can do anything.
I'm a chameleon.
I'm old.
I'm tired.
Oh, I am hot. I'm cold.
Come on, what can't I do?
First of all, bravo.
But I don't think you're right for this.
The part's a stuffy college professor.
I can do that.
Hello, I'm your professor.
When I'm not busy thinking of important things,
or professing...
...l like to use-- What's the product?
Software that facilitates inter-business networking e-solutions.
I'm cold.
- Hey. - Hey.
Guess who's a finalist
for a huge research grant?
I'll give you a hint.
He's looking right at you.
Well, unless it's the creepy guy
with his hand up his kilt...
...I'm gonna say, "Congratulations."
I'm so excited.
Apparently, I beat out hundreds of other applicants...
...including five guys I went to graduate school with.
Not that I'm keeping score, or anything. Five.
- Wow, that's great. - Yeah.
So tell me about the grant.
Well, okay, it's for $25,000.
And if I get it,
I'll be able to complete my field research.
And there will be an article about me
in the Paleontology Review.
It'll be the first time my name is in there...
...without people raising serious questions about my work.
Are you talking about the Dewer Grant?
Yeah. Why?
Benjamin Hobart is administering that grant.
- Your ex-boyfriend? - Yeah.
So your ex-boyfriend is gonna determine
if your new boyfriend gets this grant?
Wow, your new boyfriend is screwed.
No. No, we ended on great terms.
I mean if anything,
I think this could help you. You know what?
Why don't we all go out to dinner,
and I can introduce you.
If you think it'd help.
Yeah, absolutely. I'll call him.
Now, is there anything I could do to butter him up?
Anything he really likes?
He does have a pretty serious latex fetish.
We'll see how dinner goes.
- Hey. - Hey, you want to go see a movie?
I told you I had to spend all day clearing out stuff
so Mike could move in.
- Oh, right. - Yeah.
Now that I'm here,
I might as well help with the cleaning and organizing.
I just happen to have my label maker.
Oh, it's so hard to get rid of stuff.
Did you and Chandler make compromises
when you moved in together?
Chandler did.
What does he want you to give up?
A bunch of stuff.
And the worst one,
he wants me to get rid of Gladys.
Who's Gladys?
What a tragic loss.
Yeah, I really hate to give her up.
Oh, I know. Oh, you should take her.
I don't know.
What, you don't like her?
Of course I do. What's not to like?
I'd take her in a minute.
But I think that you're giving up too easy.
Honey, I think that you need to fight for her.
- Really, you think? - Absolutely.
You say to him,
"I'm sorry, Mike, I can't live without her.
She means too much to me."
Okay, I'll fight for her. Okay.
Oh, wait. I just realized, if I do that,
that means you don't get her.
Damn it, I did not think this through.
- Hey, guys. - Hey.
Oh, any word on casting yet?
I told you, you're not right for the part.
What do you mean?
Rach, don't I seem like a professor
you'd buy some kind of e-crap from?
I'm sorry,
this sounds like something I'm never gonna be interested in.
Look, come on, please?
It's not like I'm asking you for some crazy favor.
This is what I do for a living.
I am a professional actor.
Man, I'm two hours late for work.
Here's a copy of my reel.
It's got all the commercials that I've been in.
- Joe-- - Just watch it.
If you don't like it,
don't pass it on to your bosses.
- Fine. - Thank you.
- Work, Joe. - Damn it.
What am I gonna do now?
Just pass the tape along.
He's not right for the part.
If I suggest him,
my bosses will think I'm an idiot.
And that's something they should learn on their own.
Just tell Joey that you watched the tape...
...and you liked it, but your bosses didn't.
Then that way, you're the good guy,
and they're the bad guy.
That's good. I liked it, they didn't.
Joey, for God's sake, go to work.
I can't believe I'm about to meet Benjamin Hobart.
I've always thought of him as someone I'd invite...
...to my fantasy dinner party.
Do you think there's any chance
he'll bring Christie Brinkley or C-3PO?
Sorry, it looks like it's just him.
Charlie.
My God, you look absolutely stunning.
Well, I am having a good hair day.
- It's so good to see you. - Oh, you too.
I'm okay.
I'm sorry. Ross Geller, Benjamin Hobart.
It's an honor to meet you.
I can't tell you how long...
...I've been an admirer of your work. I mean, that Nobel Prize.
I mean, I have to tell you
that you're one of the reasons I got into the field.
Well, likewise.
Actually not likewise.
I'd never heard of you until this morning.
But it's nice to be nice.
- Shall we? - Yeah. Thank you.
I can't believe that you chose this restaurant.
Do you remember the night?
Oh, my God. I completely forgot.
Oh, my God, I can't believe they let us back in this place.
You weren't there.
No, but, you know, it's just a funny image.
You know, the two of you in this restaurant with the....
Ross, why don't you tell Benji
about your proposal while I go to the ladies' room.
So tell me about it.
Okay. Well, I would like to do a dig in the Painted Desert.
There are still several areas that haven't been fully excavated.
- Break up with Charlie. - What?
What?
Did you just say, "Break up with Charlie"?
Well, yes and no.
Yes, I did say it. And no, I didn't not say it.
Kind of inappropriate, don't you think?
Listen, I'm sorry.
I just haven't seen her for so long,
all these feelings are rushing back.
I'm starting to realize
how much I've missed her.
And I'm gonna need you to break up with her.
Are you serious?
If you say, yes, then I'm serious.
If you say, no, then I'm joking.
- No. - Joking it is.
Hi, sorry I'm late.
Hey, how'd it go with Mike?
Is he gonna let you keep the painting?
No, he really hates it.
But he's gonna let me keep my box of human hair.
So you gotta pick your battles.
But the good news is, Gladys is yours.
Wow, what's the bad news?
Who's Gladys?
Oh, she's that work of art I made.
You know, with the woman coming out of the frame.
And Monica gets to keep her?
In her house? I am so jealous.
I didn't know you wanted her too.
Well, I mean, sure, of course.
But you already gave that to Monica, so....
You know, I would give her up for you.
No, I couldn't let you do that.
- No, but I want to. - But I don't want you to.
- But I insist. - But I insist harder.
Girls. Girls. Stop. Okay, we'll flip a coin.
Heads, she's Rachel's.
Tails, she's Monica's.
Tails. Monica, she's yours.
No, that landed in your food.
No, no, that's okay.
You won fair and square. I'm so sad.
Hey, Joe?
- What's up? - Bad news.
I watched the tape
and passed it along to my bosses
and they weren't interested.
I'm sorry, man.
But you watched the tape?
Yeah, I liked it.
But my bosses didn't go for it.
Stupid sons of bitches.
You didn't watch the tape.
What? Of course I did.
Look, it's one thing not to cast me,
but to lie to me?
I'm not lying to you. I watched it.
You lied again.
- I watched it. - Keep going, Pinocchio.
- I did. - No, you didn't.
I'm telling you, I watched the tape.
- Did you watch the tape? - No.
All right. The selection committee has chosen
the three of you as our finalists.
The ultimate decision will be based on the answers
you give to the questions I ask.
We're gonna go ahead and start with Dr. Li.
Dr. Li, you claim the field is too reliant
on the Linnaean taxonomic system.
How do you propose to correct this problem?
Well, I believe that the answers
lie in the osteological evidence.
- I plan to begin there. - Interesting.
I guess.
Dr. Biely, your proposal includes some fieldwork.
Where might that take place?
Primarily in the Pierre Shale region of South Dakota.
Certainly. Very well.
And Dr.Geller, when is my birthday?
What? I--
Care to venture a guess?
- May 12? - That's not even kind of close.
Dr. Li, how many graduate students you'd be needing?
Half a dozen.
I see. And Dr. Biely?
Three for excavation, and two for analysis.
Certainly. Dr. Geller, which 1965 Shirelles hit...
...was later covered by a popular British Invasion band?
What? I need six graduate students.
No, I'm sorry.
We were looking for "Baby It's You."
"Baby It's You."
What? Wait just a minute.
None of my questions have anything to do with paleontology.
You're right, I apologize.
Scratch the last question.
Spell "Boscodictiasaur."
I've never heard of a "Boscodictiasaur."
Yeah, I just made it up. Spell it.
Okay. B-O-S-
No, it starts with a silent M.
Oh, come on!
I can't believe Joey.
I hate being called a liar.
But you are a liar.
What did I just say?
Are you still here?
Yes. And I have to say.
And I'm not just hurt, I'm insulted.
When I tell somebody I did something--
Okay, hold on, let me just stop you right there, okay?
First, you lied. Right?
Then you lied about lying, okay?
Then you lied about
lying about lying, okay?
So before you lie about
lying about lying about lying about lying....
Stop lying.
Why are you so sure
I didn't watch this tape?
You wanna know why?
You wanna know why?
Well, this is going well.
Here's how I know you didn't watch.
If you had seen what was on this tape,
believe me, you'd have some comments.
All right, remember, I got paid a lot of money for this...
...and it only aired in Japan.
Ichiban.
Ichiban, lipstick for men.
Ichiban, lipstick for men.
And that's how I know you didn't watch the tape.
He really is a chameleon.
Well, Gladys, say hello to your new home.
- Oh, my. - Wow.
Oh, she is so nice and big.
Oh, Monica, where are you going to display Gladys,
oh, so proudly?
I haven't really settled on a spot yet.
How about right above the TV?
That way, it will be the first thing that you see
when you walk in the door.
Yeah, yeah,
and you can get rid of that French poster.
- I like that poster. - Really?
It doesn't have anything coming out of it.
Or maybe there's someplace for her in your bedroom?
There's nothing above your bed.
Are you still here?
Oh, hi. Hello.
Have you come to ask me some more paleontology-related questions?
Your grandmother's nickname, perhaps?
Aunt Margaret's pants size?
I've come here to apologize.
I think I may have let my feelings...
...for Charlie interfere with the interview process.
No. Stop.
Anyway, I decided to offer you the grant.
Really?
There is just one small stipulation.
I have to break up with Charlie?
Hey, you got one right.
You're crazy.
Crazy or romantic?
Crazy.
- Or? - Get out!
Oh, my God.
What?
Joey, what is this thing doing here?
I got her from Monica.
She sold it to me for a very reasonable price.
Joey, we're not keeping this.
But it's an original Buffay.
All right, fine. You can keep it.
As long as you don't mind that she's haunted.
Hey, what? What?
Well, legend has it, Joey,
that she comes alive when you're asleep.
She climbs out of the frame...
...and then drags her half-a-body
across the floor...
...just looking for legs to steal.
And then with her one good hand...
...she slowly reaches up...
...and turns your doorknob.
Get that legless witch out of here!
Hey, I sold that to Joey.
Yeah, well, I told him it's haunted.
Two can play at this game.
Too late. You can't give it back.
Oh, yes, I can.
No, you can't, she's yours.
- She's yours. - She's yours.
She's yours.
Hey.
- She's mine. - She's mine.
- She's mine. - She's mine.
You guys, you don't have to fight over her anymore.
Whoever doesn't get Gladys,
gets Glynnis.
- I want Gladys. - She's mine.
- She's mine. - She's mine.
I know. Look, I'm sorry I didn't give them your tape.
And I promise next time to submit you,
whether I think you're right or not.
That's not the point, Chandler.
The point is that you lied.
I know. You're right.
What's it gonna take for you to forgive me?
Oh, my God.
Excellent.
Now what do you say?
Lying is wrong.
And? And?
I'm a pretty little girl.
I knew it.
Your ex-boyfriend is insane.
Did you get the grant?
No. And you wanna know why?
Because your ex-boyfriend is still in love with you.
- What? - Yeah.
He wouldn't give me the grant,
because I wouldn't give you up.
Benji isn't in love with me.
I mean, he broke up with me.
And besides, he's a very ethical man.
Really?
Is it ethical to ask someone in a grant review:
"Who was the voice of Underdog?"
I'm sure he was just joking, Ross.
If you don't believe me, let's go talk to him.
I'm telling you,
he didn't ask me one paleontological question.
Seriously?
Oh, I'm sorry. No, he did ask me one:
"How do you spell Boscodictiasaur?"
Well, if it's like the Lake Mbosco in Congo,
then M-B-O--
Damn it.
Dr. Geller. Charlie, what are you doing here?
I want you to tell her everything.
About the deal you tried to make with me,
about the crazy questions you--
Wally Cox. That's the voice of Underdog.
Like I tried to tell you in the interview...
...this grant is not based on
your knowledge of pretty useless trivia.
No, don't do that.
I want you to look her in the eyes
and tell her the truth.
Benji?
All right. It's true.
I behaved horribly,
but it's only because I still love you.
And I would do anything
to have you back in my life.
Too little, too late, Benji.
I can't believe this.
I never should've broken up with you.
I think about you all the time.
Do you ever still think about me?
No.
- Yes. - What?
I don't know what to say, Benji.
This is all so...
...romantic.
Or?
I know I may be way out of bounds here...
...but is there any chance you would take me back?
Maybe.
Sweetie, this conversation is starting to
make me a little uncomfortable.
Oh, God. I am so sorry, but--
I mean, there's so much history between us, you know?
I'm sorry too.
I love you.
I love you too.
Okay, that's it, we are seeing other people.
Gladys?
For the third time this week.
Man, this does not get old.
You're mean!
Oh, don't be such a baby. Please.
Hey, you guys. Hey, what are you doing?
Figuring out our wedding plans.
Funny. We were doing the same thing.
It's really crazy. The hall, the dress, the food.
I had no idea how expensive this was.
Yeah, it is really pricey.
I freaked when I heard the numbers.
So, what did you two do about it?
It was simple.
I came up with some cost-cutting solutions...
...wrote out a list, and Monica told me to go to hell.
There's no way around it.
Just accept that this is gonna cost a lot of money.
I heard that weddings are, like, a $40 billion-a-year industry.
Yeah. And I'm responsible for just, like, half of that.
But really, it does seem like this money could be put to better use.
Are you serious?
Yeah. How would you feel
if we gave all the wedding money to charity...
...and we just got married at City Hall?
I think it would make me wanna marry you even more.
I gotta say, you guys, that's an incredible gesture.
Maybe you do that next time you get married.
No, no, no. The next time's gonna be Hawaii at sunset.
But maybe the time after that.
Friends S10E07 The One With The Home Study
- Hey. What's going on? - Hey.
Our adoption social worker is coming,
so we're cleaning the apartment.
"We"?
You know you don't want me to help.
You can't have it both ways.
Is this the person who decides
whether or not you get a baby?
Kind of. She's coming by to interview us and see where we live.
And it has to go perfectly,
because if she doesn't like something about us
she can keep us off
every adoption list in the state.
Hey, maybe I should stop by.
She could be a soap opera fan.
It's very impressive
when the little people know a celebrity.
"Little people"?
"Celebrity."
So I think I'm just about done here.
Unless you have any bad stuff hidden somewhere,
like porn or cigarettes?
What?
- No. - Chandler.
I don't,
and I'm offended by the insinuation.
So there's not a magazine under the couch...
...or cigarettes taped to the back of the toilet tank...
...or a filthy video in the VCR?
I'll admit to the cigarettes and magazine.
But that tape is not mine.
It isn't mine.
I guess we'll never know whose it is.
May I help you?
Yes. We're here
to make a rather sizable donation to the children.
Any contribution, large or small,
is appreciated.
I think you're gonna appreciate
the crap out of this one.
Well, this is very generous.
And we don't want any recognition.
This is completely anonymous.
Completely anonymous. From two kind strangers.
Mr. X and Phoebe Buffay.
Well if you like,
we can include your names in our newsletter.
Not necessary.
Buffay is spelled B-U-F-F-A-Y.
And X is spelled "Mike Hannigan."
Well, on behalf of the children, thank you both very much.
I'm glad we did this. It feels so good.
It does. It feels really good.
Oh, look. And we get these free T-shirts.
Actually, that's the shirt I wore to the gym.
It's moist.
Hi. Emma will be up in a minute.
Oh, good.
Hey, Ross, listen. I heard about you and Charlie.
I'm really sorry.
That's okay.
I'm sure there are tons of other beautiful paleontologists out there.
Absolutely.
There was one. She's it.
All the rest look like they should live under a bridge.
So, what are you gonna do today?
I was thinking of taking Emma to the playground.
Oh, my God. What?
Like I said, I was thinking of
taking Emma to the Museum of Knives and Fire.
Okay, look, Ross.
I do not want Emma going to the playground.
Because...?
All right, if you must know, I had a traumatic...
...swing incident when I was little.
- Seriously? - Yes. I was 4 years old.
And I was on the swing...
...and then all of a sudden my hair got tangled in the chain.
And to get me out,
my mom had to cut a big chunk of my hair.
And it was uneven for weeks.
And you made it through that?
I wonder who's gonna play you in the movie.
Okay, fine, you can make fun of me.
I do not want Emma going there.
And I was thinking Claire Danes.
Look, I'm sorry to hear about your tragedy.
But the swings are perfectly safe.
And besides, Emma loves them.
You should come, and you'll see.
Those things go, like, 40 miles an hour.
And there's that moment when you're at the top...
...when you just don't know if you're gonna return back to Earth.
Space is filled with orbiting children.
Look, please, just come on.
When you see the look on Emma's face,
I swear, you won't regret it.
- All right. - Good.
You don't wanna be a mom
who passes her irrational fears to her children.
"Irrational," huh?
I'll remember that next time
you freak out about a spider in your apartment.
That's the same. I'm sure there are 30
different species of poisonous swings.
Oh, my God. The adoption lady is early.
Okay. Okay. Here we go. Here we go.
Stand up straight.
Big smile.
Hello. Is this the Creepy residence?
We're waiting for the adoption lady.
But I'm glad you're here.
I was cleaning this morning
and I found this.
I don't know if you wanna use it, but....
Oh, this is so sweet of you.
But you know what?
I won't be needing a veil,
I actually won't be wearing a dress at all!
I told you,
I am not coming to a naked wedding!
No. We're not having a big reception.
we took the money we were gonna spend on a wedding
and we donate them to the children charity.
That's crazy!
I'm sorry. I can't imagine giving up
my one wedding day like that.
Well, we're different.
I don't care about having a huge party.
This is really nice for you, but....
Oh, please. I put this on and I just look like--
Well, radiant.
All right, but who cares?
I don't need a pretty veil and a fancy dress.
That's right. You're making a commitment.
You know, that's the same whether you do it at the Plaza or....
- Where you gonna do it? - City Hall.
Oh, that sounds nice.
I was just there for jury duty.
They've really spruced that place up.
Okay. It's okay...
I've made my decision.
What I really want is a great big wedding.
But you gave all the money to charity.
Well, I'll just ask for it back.
I don't think you can do that.
Why not?
This is her wedding day.
That's way more important than some stupid kids.
That's sweet, honey,
but save something for the adoption lady.
- All right, okay. Be careful. - Okay.
Careful. Watch her hair. Watch her hair!
Rach, she's got, like, three hairs.
I know. I know.
But they're just so beautiful.
Oh, my God, I just pulled one out.
I promise you she's safe.
Watch how much she loves this.
Okay. Okay.
Are you ready, sweetie? Here we go.
Okay, careful. Okay.
She's smiling.
Look at that, she does like it.
See, I told you.
Oh, my God.
Look at her, she's a little daredevil.
Oh, God. Let me push. Can I push?
Oh, absolutely.
Oh, God. Okay, get the camera.
It's in the diaper bag.
Okay.
See? Scared of the swings.
I bet you feel pretty silly.
We're asking for the money back?
It's for our wedding day.
Now, is this guy gay or straight?
Because one of us has to start flirting.
You here to make another donation the same day?
I don't think that's ever happened before.
Gay. Go.
Oh, my God, I love your shirt.
The donation we made earlier?
Well, we want it back.
Excuse me?
Okay, that money was for a big wedding
we thought we didn't want.
But it turns out we do.
So you're asking us
to refund your donation to the children?
Yeah.
This feels really good.
I'm sorry. I am.
But this wedding's just really important to me.
Hey, it's none of my business.
Besides, this is probably a good thing.
We've really been spoiling the children,
what with all the food and warm clothing.
That's not fair.
A person's wedding is important.
And especially to me.
I didn't have a graduation party.
And I didn't go to prom.
And I spent my sweet 16 being chased around a tire yard...
...by an escaped mental patient
who, in his own words, wanted to:
"Kill me, or whatever."
So I deserve a real celebration.
And I'm not gonna let some sweaty little man
make me feel badly about it.
She could've been talking about either one of us.
Hi, I'm Laura.
I'm here for your adoption interview.
Hi, I'm Monica. And this is Chandler.
- Please come in. - Thank you.
Would you like something to drink?
Water would be fine.
We're so glad that you're here.
We're excited about getting this process started.
Because we love kids. Love them to death.
Well, not actually to death.
That's just a figure of speech.
We love kids the appropriate amount...
...as allowed by law.
- Your place is just lovely. - Thank you.
Yes, this building does have a wholesome,
family feel to it.
I feel like I've been here before.
Any other couples in the building adopting?
Is that that couple on the first floor?
Because we should get a baby before them.
That guy tried to sell me drugs.
But other than that,
wholesome, wholesome building.
What?
I realized why I remember this place.
Really? What is it?
Oh, it's nothing.
I went on a date with a guy who lived in this building.
It didn't end very well.
That wouldn't, by any chance, be Joey Tribbiani?
- Yes! - Of course it was.
We had a great night.
In the morning, he promised he'd call
and he didn't.
Rat bastard!
So you're not friends with him?
Oh, God, no.
No, no, no.
No. Nope.
No...
No...
No...
No...
No...
Well, I'm sorry I brought it up.
So are either one of you planning on staying at home?
Hello? Anybody in there order a celebrity?
What was that?
That's just some crazy guy who roams the halls here.
He's great with kids, though.
Ross. Oh, my God, are you okay?
Son of a bitch!
Oh, relax. I didn't say the F-word.
Ross, see,
I told you! Those swings are evil!
That is it.
That's the last time Emma is getting on
one of those things for her entire life.
No, no, no. Okay, it wasn't the swing's fault.
It was my fault.
And kind of that kid's fault.
Who is still laughing. Nice.
Come on. Can we just get out of here
before somebody else gets hurt?
No. Wait. Ok, ok. I have an idea.
I want you to get on the swing...
...and you'll see that there's nothing to be afraid of.
I know what this is all about.
You've always been jealous of my hair.
I just think you're an adult, okay?
And you should get over your silly fears.
All right, fine. I'll do it.
Good.
If you hold a spider.
Where?! Where?!
If you hold a spider.
I know.
Guys, is everything okay?
It's me, Joey.
Adoption!
What's going on?
Oh, it's just like I said, that crazy...
...Bert, roaming the halls.
Guys?
Keep on roaming, Bert!
We don't want any crazy today!
What's going on?
We'll talk later! Bert. Everything's fine!
Everything doesn't sound fine.
Is he all right out there by himself?
Oh, yeah. He has a caretaker.
His older brother...
...Ernie.
Bert and Ernie?
You can't make this stuff up.
You never told me about that guy
and your sweet 16.
I'm sorry about that.
Oh, it ended okay.
One of my friends shot him.
At least you'll get a proper wedding.
You really deserve that.
Yeah, I really do.
You know, I had nothing growing up.
Just like the kids I took the money from.
No... I see where this is going.
Don't make me go back there.
Look, I can't have a wedding with this money now.
It's tainted.
Fine, we'll give the money back.
If that guy at the charity
gives us a hard time...
...my friend hasn't shot anyone in a really long time.
I must say this seems like
a lovely environment to raise a child in.
You are welcome to look under
any of the furniture...
...because, believe me,
you won't find any porn or cigarettes under there.
Before we look around,
let me make sure
I have everything I need up to here.
Why don't I show you the baby's room.
What are you doing?
You wouldn't let me in.
I thought you were in trouble.
Well, we're not.
But you called me "Bert."
That's our code word for danger.
We don't have a code word.
We don't?
We really should.
From now on,
"Bert" will be our code word for danger.
So that was the baby's room.
What room should we see next?
Any room that isn't behind this couch.
Some people don't get him,
but I think he's really funny.
I did not care for that.
You have to leave.
You slept with our social worker
and never called her back.
She is still pissed,
so she can't see you.
Okay, okay.
- What? - I forgot my bat.
Oh, my God.
And for the last time,
we do not want to be friends with you!
And we don't wanna buy your bat!
What are you doing here?
Bert...
Are you friends with him?
I can explain.
Joey?
All right. Okay.
You have got some nerve coming back here.
I can't believe you never called me.
Excuse me?
You probably don't even remember my name.
It's Joey, by the way.
And don't bother telling me yours,
because I totally remember it, lady.
I waited weeks for you to call me.
I gave you my number.
You never called me.
Don't try to turn this around on me.
I am not some kind of social work...
...that you can just...
...do.
I'm pretty sure I gave you my number.
Really? Think about it. Come on.
You're a beautiful woman.
Smart, funny.
We had a really good time.
If I had your number,
why wouldn't I call you?
I don't know.
Well, maybe I'm wrong.
I'm sorry.
Hey, too late for apologies. Okay?
You broke my heart.
You know how many women
I had to sleep with to get over you?
- Joey, wait-- - No!
I waited a long time!
I can't wait anymore.
I'm sorry that you had to see that.
I'm so embarrassed.
Oh, that's really okay.
Yeah. We totally understand.
Dating is hard.
Boy, you people are nice.
And I've got to say...
...l think you're going to make excellent parents.
Laura!
We're back.
Are you here to take more money?
Because I think what you're looking for is an ATM.
No, no, we're here to give the money back.
Yeah. Because you know what?
It's all about the children.
Although it's also about the wedding.
All right, here.
No. Oh, God.
If I haven't said so already,
sir, congratulations.
Enough, all right?
I'm stepping in and putting my foot down.
As your future husband,
I'm gonna make this decision for us.
What do you think we should do?
You know what. It's not your decision anymore.
What?
On behalf of the children of New York,
I reject your money.
But we're giving you this.
And I'm giving it back to you.
Come on. Consider it a contribution.
Well, this is very generous.
Please take the check.
Have a great wedding
and a wonderful life together.
Sounds good to me.
We can save up, come back in a few years...
...and make an even bigger donation.
Absolutely. And when you do, make sure you ask for Brian.
- Oh, is that you? - No.
Hello?
Oh, hi.
Oh, my God, really?
I can't wait to tell Chandler.
Okay. Goodbye.
Wrong number?
That was Laura.
She gave us a great report
and we're officially on the waiting list.
That's great.
Now we just wait for a call...
...and someone tells us
there's a baby waiting for us.
Hello?
Have you seen Joey's bat?
Okay. I got a spider.
There were two, I picked the bigger one.
- Okay. - Okay.
This feels perfectly normal.
Okay, get on the swing.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
See?
All right. I can do this.
There you go. Good for you.
You know what? I'm getting used to this little guy.
I don't even feel him in here anymore.
That's because he's on your neck.
- Hey, guys. - Hey.
- Hi. - Hey.
We need to talk about something.
Yeah. We don't feel like
we can host Thanksgiving this year.
- What... - Are you kidding?
Well, it's just with work and the stress of adoption...
...we don't feel like we have the energy.
Plus, we don't think it's fair
that every year the burden falls on us.
That doesn't sound like you.
That's Monica talking.
No, no, we made this decision together.
She's putting words in your mouth.
Don't you put words in people's mouths.
You put turkey in people's mouths.
I can't believe this.
This is Emma's first Thanksgiving.
No, it's not.
It's not? When was she born?
Well, personally,
I think it's great you're giving yourself a break.
Thank you, Pheebs.
Sure. It's just as well.
I mean, last year wasn't very good.
I think she's losing her touch.
What? You are way off, lady.
Am l? Really? Am l?
Well, why don't you cook Thanksgiving dinner
and prove me wrong.
Well, think about it.
You'd be trying to top what you did last year.
You'd be in competition with yourself.
That's my favorite kind.
Okay, we are doing this.
Don't let yourself get manipulated this way.
Stay out of this, Chandler.
This is between me and me.
We are supposed to
make these decisions together.
Did you not watch the Dr. Phil I taped for you?
Friends S10E08 The One With The Late Thanksgiving
- Hey. - Hi. Happy Thanksgiving.
Happy Needless Turkey-Murder Day.
You guys, I ordered some chocolate pies
from that bakery on Bleeker.
Could you pick them up for me?
You're not making the pies?
I don't make chocolate pies.
When I was younger,
I entered this pie-eating contest.
I ate so many
that the thought of them makes me sick.
Did you at least win the contest?
Two minutes, twelve pies and a part of one tin.
Okay, I'll see you guys at 4.
Can't wait.
This dinner is gonna be so great.
In your face, last-year me.
- Hey, Rach? - Yeah.
What's Emma doing today?
Well, let's see,
I know that she has a meeting with her lawyer...
...and then she has to make a very big poop.
Why?
Well, I want to enter her in a baby pageant.
Oh, my God.
That's the creepiest thing I've ever heard.
Okay, but before you say no,
my friend Suzanne is entering her kid.
And compared to Emma,
she's a real dog.
Phoebe, all babies are beautiful.
Oh, okay.
No. Phoebe,
just the idea of pitting one baby against another...
...l mean, you know,
and judging who's cuter just for a trophy...
And a thousand dollars.
...is something I'm very interested in.
Oh, please, do not tell Ross.
He still believes that
what's on the inside is important.
Okay. And Emma needs a cowgirl outfit
for the competition.
Where am I gonna get a cowgirl outfit on Thanksgiving?
Well, I was thinking--
Take the clothes off Joey's Cabbage Patch Kid!
Did someone drop the baton again?
Why come all the way from Kansas
to do that?
I don't get older, I just get better.
You know what just occurred to me?
This could be our last Thanksgiving
just the two of us.
I mean, we could be getting a baby soon.
You don't know that.
Somebody's gonna pick us.
But we haven't heard a thing
from the adoption agency.
I'm telling you, it's gonna happen.
Next year,
it's gonna be you, me and little Hemingway Bing.
What? He's my favorite author.
Name one of his books.
The Firm?
Okay, let's see. Okay, the turkey's in the oven.
The stuffing is ready.
You know,
you always cook this meal all by yourself.
Let me help this year.
Oh, Chandler, that's sweet.
But you don't have to do everything Dr. Phil tells you to do.
I'm serious, let me do something.
Just not the turkey. Nothing high-profile.
Okay, let's see.
Oh, the cranberry sauce.
It's easy to make,
and no one really cares about it.
Tell me more.
I'm gonna go check on something across the hall.
You start by washing these.
Not with soap!
You obviously haven't tasted my Palmolive potatoes.
Hi. Hey, guess what Joey has.
Three tickets to today's Rangers game!
Dude, I wanted him to guess.
Oh, my God.
Yeah, they're great seats too.
Guess where they are.
Center ice.
Did I do something to you?
The game's at 1.
So?
Dinner's at 4. We'll never make it back.
So we'll leave before it's over.
We'll be back in time.
You said that now.
But it could take us a long time to get back home.
Plus, Joey could get lost
and they could have to page us to go pick him up.
Dude, two times that happened!
Look, Monica's been working hard all day.
She didn't want to host in the first place.
We shouldn't go.
He's right, man.
Yeah, I guess. So we'll see you at 4.
Okay.
And get ready to taste
my very special cranberries.
Or should I say "Chan-berries"?
That's some gentle comedy, dude.
We're still going to the game, right?
Yeah.
Hey.
Phoebe, listen, I think we gotta go.
This place is freaking me out.
I've been watching this guy over there.
I don't think he came with a kid.
But we can't leave now.
There was this one baby, Haley,
who was favored to win...
...she got croup, so she had to stay home.
This competition just blew wide-open, folks.
Phoebe, it's just too weird.
I just saw a 1 -year-old with pantyhose on.
Oh, I know. We should've been more prepared.
It's okay. Now, the way I see it,
our real competition now is Cameron.
My God, they just took her sweater off.
Look at those arms. Hello, Michelin Man.
Phoebe, come on.
You know what, it's already 3:00.
They haven't even gotten to Emma's group yet.
We got dinner.
But Emma's got what it takes.
She could go all the way!
Phoebe, you have to calm down.
Okay.
Rachel, the hottest babies in the tri-state area
are in this room right now.
I overheard a judge say
that not one of them holds a candle to Emma.
- Really? - Yeah.
You heard him say that?
Yeah.
All right. Okay. All right,
let's give these babies something to cry about.
Good. Let's get down to business.
Emma needs some makeup.
What?
She's gonna look washed-out next to the others.
No, Phoebe, I'm not letting you put makeup on my baby.
Why not?
Because I already did.
You suck! Get off the ice, you idiot!
- What a game. - I know. Yeah.
I can't believe Chandler's missing this.
I'm sorry he's not here.
But I gotta say,
I am really enjoying nacho chair.
Yeah, I'd probably enjoy it more
if you didn't keep batting my hand away.
These seats are great.
I know, I know.
When I was here for "Holidays on lce" ...
...l was sitting so far away,
Michelle Kwan couldn't read my banner.
We'd better get going.
If we don't leave now, we're gonna be late.
But it's a tie game.
So we're a little late.
The girls will be there.
Let's just stay for one more goal.
- I don't know. - One more fight.
- Okay. - Okay.
Where is everybody?
They're 45 minutes late.
I can't believe they're not here.
I slave and I slave for what?
They've ruined Cranberry Day.
How late are we?
Forty-five minutes.
- Here. - Okay.
Rachel and Phoebe are already there,
so they probably started without us.
We could just slip in,
and no one needs to know where we were.
You may want to lose the foam finger.
Oh, no, no, no.
You just want to put it on your hand.
You're not at Thanksgiving?
No, we're late.
What are you doing here?
We're late too.
We figured we could be late
because you'd be on time.
Don't point that thing at me, Tribbiani.
So nobody's here?
Monica's gonna kill us.
Yeah, where were you?
Yeah, what's with the trophy?
Well, we were at a spelling bee.
And I won.
You won an adult
Thanksgiving Day spelling bee?
Yes. Y-E-S. Yes.
Let me see this.
"Grand Supreme Little Darling, New York Division"?
That's me.
You entered Emma in a beauty pageant?
And it looks like she put makeup on her.
Wait a second...
Where have I seen that cowgirl outfit before?
I can't believe this.
She's our daughter.
That you would treat her like some kind of show dog
is inexcusable.
She won a thousand dollars.
So this is an annual thing?
That's Alicia May Emory's outfit!
Guys, there are people in there
who are not getting any happier.
What are we gonna do?
I don't know, you guys figure it out.
I gotta put Emma down for a nap.
And, Rach, while you're in there,
throw something on Alicia May.
All right, what are we gonna say?
We'll say that we were mugged.
You can't get mad at someone
who's been mugged.
Good. But you don't look like you were mugged.
No. Here.
Hey!
Do you hear something?
- They're out there. - Let me see.
I can't believe this.
They're an hour late,
and they're just standing there talking.
Everything's so distorted.
It looks like Joey has a giant hand.
That says "Rangers" on it.
They went to the game.
Oh, they are in for a world of pain.
Ross' shirt is torn.
They're late and they're sloppy.
All right, Emma's napping.
What happened to your shirt?
I got mugged,
and they stole my pocket.
We're just trying to figure out an excuse.
How about this?
We could say that
Monica told us 5:00, not 4:00.
That way we're right on time.
Or we could plant PCP in the apartment
and call the cops on her.
That would be a good way
to get rid of all the PCP we have lying around.
We'll just say that she said it was 5:00.
We'll just act casual.
We're not late, we're right on time.
"We know you're out there."
Who do you think it's from?
Oh, God, this is bad. This is so bad.
Well, let's just go in there and face them.
I'm not going in first.
I bet that vein on Monica's forehead is popping like crazy.
I hate that thing.
It's like a bolt of lightning.
I have an idea.
Why don't we play Rock, Paper, Scissors,
and whoever loses, goes in first.
- All right, I'm in. - Ready.
I win.
What is that?
That's fire. It beats everything.
Oh, really? Does it beat water balloon?
Well-played, Phoebe Buffay. Well-played.
All right, enough,
let's all go in at the same time.
- Okay. - Okay.
It's locked.
What? Oh, sure, now they lock it.
When they're having sex
on the couch, it's like:
"Come on in, my butt is surprisingly hairy!"
All right, come on. All right, you guys,
we're so sorry we're late.
Please let us in so we can have dinner together.
No, everything's cold.
The turkey's dried out and the stuffing's all soggy.
Yeah, and there's a bowl of cranberry sauce that's--
What happens to cranberry sauce?
Nothing, it's fine.
Oh, thank God.
Come on, you guys, we're sorry.
Our subway broke down.
That's a lie!
You went to the game.
I can see Joey's hand.
For the love of God, take it off!
Guys, it doesn't matter why we're late.
We're all here now.
Please let us in so we can
have some of your delicious turkey.
I had a dream once
about a fax machine that did that.
That's all the turkey you're gonna get.
How are we gonna decide who gets this?
Water balloon!
What are we gonna do?
I'm starving.
I just remembered,
we do have something to eat.
Monica put something
in our oven this morning.
You touch that, and you will be sorry!
Guys, I'd listen to her.
The vein is bigger than I've ever seen it!
Oh, my God, it's Brussels sprouts!
That's worse than no food.
All you got was Monica's stinky Brussels sprouts.
Stinky?
Please let me stay on this side of the door.
Oh, I know! I still have my old key.
We can just unlock the door.
I don't know if that's a good idea.
They don't wanna be with us.
You know what.
I don't wanna be with them either...
...but it's Thanksgiving,
and we should not want to be together together.
If I could just get in there,
make a face-to-face apology...
...look them in the eye,
I could get them to forgive us.
I don't know.
I'm telling you...
...l can do it.
Yeah, he can do it.
It all looks so beautiful.
The turkey, the stuffing.
The cranberries.
Enough! A monkey could've made them.
Hey, listen, guys, we feel really terrible.
He's doing that weird eye-contact thing.
Don't look at him.
Come on, you guys.
We want you to know we're very, very sorry.
Right, guys?
- I feel terrible. - Oh, so sorry.
But let's not ruin this day.
You've worked so hard.
Let's move past this
and try to have a nice meal all together, huh?
The floating heads do make a good point.
Yeah, they do seem to feel pretty bad.
So bad.
So bad.
Okay.
Okay, you two go get the dessert,
and I'll let you in.
Dessert?
Yeah, I asked you and Phoebe to pick up the pies.
You did remember, right?
Pies. Oh, we thought you said "prize."
Here.
"Grand Supreme Little Darling"?
Congratulations!
Oh, my God, you forgot the pies?
Well, I cannot believe this.
You forced me to make dinner,
you're an hour late...
...and you forget the one little thing
that I asked you to do.
Really, girls, not cool.
Well, you man-heads aren't any better.
You lied about going to the game.
You knew it'd make you late,
and you went anyway.
Hey, I'm getting a little tired of this.
We said we're sorry.
It's Thanksgiving, for Pete's sakes!
A day of forgiveness.
It's a day to be thankful.
Don't make me come up there!
It's too late for apologies.
Fine, let's just go.
I don't need your stupid dinner.
That would be a lot more convincing
if you weren't drooling.
Oh, is that what that is?
Sorry.
Come on, you guys, let's just do our own Thanksgiving.
Yeah, I'll cook.
Yeah, let's go out.
Yeah, you three have a nice Thanksgiving.
The three of us?
Yeah. You, Chan and the vein.
I'm stuck.
Joey, that is not gonna work.
No, seriously.
I'm really wedged in here.
I'll pull you through.
Okay.
Stop.
I'm worried about damaging my head.
It's a little late for that.
Hurry up, you gotta do something.
All right, well, this does not change anything.
We need to get something
to grease the sides of his face
We got turkey grease.
Bring it.
I just want to say that I'm sorry
I referred to the vein as a separate person.
Here you go.
Oh, that smells good.
- Okay? - Okay, try it.
It isn't working.
We're gonna have to unscrew the chain.
Hurry, I can't feel my ears.
Can you ever feel your ears?
Interesting.
Chandler, where are your tools?
Oh, I left them on my bulldozer.
I don't have tools.
Well, I do, but Rachel borrowed them.
I lent them to Ross.
I gave them to Joey.
I left them at the park.
I'm finding it really hard not to mess with him.
I stuffed Brussels sprouts down his pants.
Nice.
Okay, I have to get that.
Now, when I get back,
I want you and your friends to be gone.
Thanksgiving is over.
The vein has spoken.
It's really starting to hurt.
Look, I'm gonna pull on the door...
...and you guys push.
Maybe we can get enough room to wiggle him out, okay?
Okay, so push.
Just a sec.
We're kind of in the middle of something here.
Hey, stop putting things down my pants.
Come on, guys, push!
Yeah, come on, push!
Push! Push!
My cranberries!
Man, I got food all over me.
I can't believe what you did.
Monica's gonna kill you.
Look! Look! Look
what the-- Look what the floating heads did!
I don't care.
What's going on?
That was the adoption agency.
And?
We're getting a baby!
Are you serious?!
There's a pregnant woman in Ohio,
and she picked us.
Oh, my God, that's great!
That's incredible.
I'm so happy for you.
This Thanksgiving kicks last Thanksgiving's ass!
To Monica and Chandler
and that knocked-up girl in Ohio.
I'm just so happy
you guys are finally getting a kid.
I know. Have you considered pageanting?
I can't believe they called.
I mean, we're actually getting a baby.
I know how you feel.
- Really? - Sure.
I went through the exact same thing
with Alicia May Emory.
The waiting, the wondering.
Then one day,
I get that call from Toys"R"Us.
She was in stock.
That is the exact same thing.
- Hey.  - Hey.
We're here to say goodbye.
We're off to Ohio.
Oh, right, your adoption interview.
Yep. We'll meet the lady who could be carrying our baby.
I can't believe it. When you come back,
you'll have a baby. That is so weird.
And so incorrect.
She's only a couple months pregnant.
She liked our application
but might not like us.
Come on, she's gonna love you guys.
Thank you.
But we're trying not to get our hopes up.
A lot could still get in our way.
She could decide against adoption,
like another couple better.
What are you gonna name it?
I could develop a condition
in which I talk and talk
and no one hears a word.
But just think, okay? What if everything goes right?
What if this woman does pick you guys?
Oh, my God. She's gonna pick us!
So we're standing firm on
"not getting our hopes up"?
No. I know things could still go wrong,
but if they don't...
...if this works out,
we're gonna have a baby. A baby!
Yes. But--
Oh, my God. It's gonna work!
We're gonna make it work!
I'm gonna be a mommy,
and you're gonna be a daddy!
All right, I'll see you suckers.
I'm gonna go get me a baby!
Screw it. I'm gonna be a daddy!
Friends S10E09 The One With The Birth Mother
Hey, who's Phoebe with?
I wanna say,
"Someone I'm gonna have sex with."
- Hey. - Hey.
So who's your friend?
Oh, that's Sarah.
No. Don't you get any ideas.
I'm not setting you up with
any more of my friends.
Why? Why?
Because you'll date her once...
...sleep with her, then forget she exists.
Name one friend of yours I did that with.
- Mandy.  - Mandy, huh?
Really hot blond, big boobs?
No.
Might be why I don't remember, huh?
Do you think I'm someone else?
Look, I may not have treated
your friends well in the past.
But I have grown up a lot.
Really. Honest. Rach?
Yeah, believe it or not, it's true.
I mean, when Joey and I were together...
...he was wonderful.
He was thoughtful and mature.
And for the one week that we went out...
...he didn't sleep with anybody else.
Growth.
Fine, I'll give you her number.
Okay. Thank you.
And I promise you I will not forget this one.
- Mandy.  - Sarah!
Sarah.
- Hey.  - Hi.
Hey.
Hey, guys, I need some fashion advice.
How does this look?
Well, it's-- It's a little low. Pick it up a little.
A little bit more.
A little bit more.
There you go.
Now throw it away.
Come on! This looks good.
Ross, please trust me.
I buy 30 fashion magazines a month.
Now I don't know who's running for president
or who that NATO guy is...
...but I do know that
you have to get far away from that hat.
Damn it. God....
I have this date tomorrow night,
and I have to look cool.
If you need fashion help,
Rachel and l are going shopping tomorrow.
You're more than welcome to come with us.
Really? That would be great.
I mean, I have to do something.
She kind of teased me about how I dress.
I can see why. Nice shirt.
You're wearing the same shirt.
Stupid Gap on every corner!
Make yourselves comfortable,
and I'll be back with Erica.
Okay, thank you.
Well, this is it.
Are you okay?
Yeah, it's just weird, you know?
It's like, "Hi, I'm Chandler.
May I have the human growing inside you?"
You're gonna be great.
You're gonna be great.
Well, obviously.
Monica? Chandler?
I'd like you to meet Erica.
Hi.
Hi. It is so, so nice to meet you.
- Hi. - Thank you for agreeing to see us.
- Hi.  - I'll let you get acquainted.
Okay.
So it's Monica and Chandler?
I only know you as "File CRW33815-D."
That's what our friends call us.
Gosh, you know, you're just such an amazing couple. It's...
...kind of intimidating.
I don't know about that.
Are you kidding me?
I mean, it's enough that you're a doctor.
But on top of it, you're married to a reverend?
I don't think that's exactly--
Let her finish, doctor.
- Hey.  - Hey.
My friend Sarah had a great time last night.
Yeah.
Yeah, so you gonna call this one back?
No.
What are you talking about? Sarah's great.
Oh, really? You want to know
what your "great" friend did?
We're out to dinner, okay?
We were getting along,
having a really nice time.
I was thinking she was really cool.
And then, out of nowhere...
That's it?
That's why you won't go out with her again?
So she took some fries. Big deal.
Hey, look, it's not about a few fries.
It's about what the fries represent.
- What?  - All food!
Well, I'm sorry.
I can't believe I set you up
with such a monster!
Hey, look, I take a girl out...
...she can order whatever she wants.
The more the better, all right?
Just don't order
a garden salad and then eat my food!
That's a good way to lose some fingers.
Thank God you're here. Listen to this.
What?
Joey and my friend are out last night,
having dinner, and she reaches over...
- ...and takes a few of his fries--  - Oh, no!
What?
You know about the plate thing?
Oh, yeah, yeah. No, Joey doesn't share food.
I mean, just last week we were having breakfast...
...and he had a couple grapes on his plate.
You wouldn't let her have a grape?
No, not me.
Emma.
Joey doesn't share food!
Well, I still think that is a stupid reason
not to call someone again.
You are calling her, okay?
And if you need to,
then just get an extra plate of fries for the table.
I like that.
A sharing buffer. Yeah.
Yeah, I'll order some extra fries.
Maybe a plate of onion rings.
Yeah. Yeah.
And a shrimp cocktail.
And some Buffalo wings.
Maybe.... Maybe an individual pizza, huh?
And some mozzarella sticks.
What were we talking about?
Wow, this place is awesome.
We should just go.
I'm not gonna find anything here.
This stuff is ridiculous.
Oh, this place is great!
Rach, come on, I'm not gonna wear any of this.
Nothing silver.
- Why?  - Okay, nothing with hair.
And nothing with padlocks on it!
Ross, look. Look,
I know that some of this stuff is out there.
But I mean, come on, look at this.
Look at this sweater.
I mean, this is just beautiful.
Wow, this is really soft.
350 dollars?
Down from 700.
You're saving, like, 200 bucks.
Both logic and math
are taking a serious hit today.
Hey, check this out. It's totally you.
Wow. Actually, this looks pretty good.
Yeah.
"Boys will be boys"?
- What? They will be!  - All right.
That's it, I'm getting out of here.
No, Ross, wait, come on.
There's other stuff here.
There's some nice shirts, these nice pants.
Actually, these might look pretty good on me.
Yes, they will. You know what you should do?
Go take a walk.
All right? I know your size,
and I'll pick out some really good stuff for you.
- Really?  - Yes.
I know what looks sexy on guys.
Just wear what I suggest,
and she is gonna go nuts for you.
So you're saying...
...if I wear these pants,
I might be getting into hers?
Why do men keep talking to me like this?
So the fact that I'm a doctor
and my wife's a reverend...
...that's important to you?
Yeah. I read some great applications...
...but I thought,
"Who better than a minister to raise a child?"
Amen.
Plus, I thought the baby would be in good hands with a doctor.
Good hands.
Healing hands.
Reverend, can I ask?
Does the Bible say anything about adoption?
It says, "Do it."
"And behold, she did adopt unto them a baby.
And it was good."
- Wow.  - Yeah, wow.
I was wondering-- You both have such serious jobs.
Would you have time to take care of a baby and your flock?
Oh, no, my flock? My flock is good.
Yeah. My flock pretty much takes care of themselves by this point.
Good flock. Flock...
But being a doctor, that must take up a lot of time.
Not for me it doesn't.
So how's everything going in here?
We're great.
I think I may have asked all my questions.
Good. Do you have questions for Erica?
Yeah, actually.
So you read a file that you liked...
...and then you gave the agency the serial number
and they contacted us?
Yes. Our system ensures total anonymity.
We're very proud of it.
You should be.
You're really on top of stuff.
Well then, if there's nothing else,
then the two of us should talk.
I actually....
- I don't think we have to. - We don't?
Yeah, when I read about you two,
I was pretty sure I wanted you...
...but I just thought we should meet face to face.
I've made my decision.
I choose them.
Oh, my God, this is great.
This is so great. Did you hear that?
Yeah, I did.
Hey.
Thank you. Thank you so much.
You are so going to heaven!
We got some really great stuff.
Yeah.
Yeah, but I'm not sure about some of the bras I got.
Really? Do you want to try some of them on for me?
Okay.
Wait, are we in Joey's imagination?
Oh, no. I took one of Ross' bags by mistake.
And one of mine is missing.
Ross probably has it.
You'll get it from him later.
So, what do you think?
I think we're not wearing the same shirt anymore.
Yeah. Yeah, Rachel picked it out for me.
She told me to trust her, and you know what?
I'm glad I did.
I turned quite a few heads on my way over here.
Dude, I really don't think you should be wearing that.
I see.
Somebody's afraid of a little competition with the ladies?
Looks like someone is the ladies!
You're just jealous because you couldn't pull this off.
Yeah. Now if you'll excuse me, I have a date.
See? All eyes on me!
We are not signing those papers.
Why not?
It's wrong. They made a mistake.
They think we're somebody else.
God works in mysterious ways.
You have got to stop.
But she liked us.
She likes Doctor Chandler
and Reverend Monica.
If you think about it,
I'm kind of like a reverend.
I mean, as a chef, I serve God
by feeding the hungry and poor.
Your veal chop is 34.95!
Come on,
I just-- I think we've been given an opportunity.
The mistake's already made.
They're writing up the papers now.
But we're not the ones she chose.
How can you feel okay about this?
Because.
We may not be who she thinks we are...
...but no one will ever love that baby more than us.
- I know.  - I mean, who knows...
...how long it's gonna take for someone else
to give us a baby?
What if no one ever picks us?
Oh, honey....
Please?
Please. We are so close.
Monica, I want a baby too.
But this woman is giving away her child.
She deserves to know who it's going to.
Okay. You're right.
So we'll tell the truth.
And who knows, you know?
Maybe she'll like us for us.
Maybe she will.
Why couldn't I have been a reverend?
You're Jewish.
Technicality!
Garden salad for the lady.
Oh, that looks great. Good ordering.
Seafood platter for the gentleman,
and extra fries.
Enjoy.
Those fries look delicious.
I didn't know you liked French fries.
Help yourself. What's mine is yours.
Wow, are those stuffed clams?
Yes, they are my stuffed clams.
How about those fries, though, huh?
- They are delicious.  - Yeah.
You are beautiful, you know that?
That is so sweet.
Okay, then.
Now look what you did!
What? What is the matter with you?
I don't like it
when people take food off of my plate, okay?
But you said, "What's mine is yours."
Well, I didn't mean it!
Fine. Sorry,
I didn't think it was that big a deal.
No, I'm sorry. I....
I'm overreacting, okay?
It's just, when it comes to food, l...
...have certain rules...
...okay? I mean...
...there are things you do,
and, you know, things that you don't do.
Wow, this place looks great.
Oh, you are gonna love it.
And I'm so glad we're finally doing this.
- Me too.  - Here.
So this was fun.
I really am sorry about, you know, before.
And I want to make sure you know
I really do like you.
Sure, just not as much as clams.
Well, stuffed clams....
Chocolate torte for the lady.
Cheesecake for the gentleman.
Excuse me, sir.
There seems to be some sort of red crap on my cheesecake.
Yes, that's a raspberry coulis.
I'm so stupid ordering cheesecake,
trying to be healthy.
Oh, no.
This is work. I should call in.
Can you excuse me?
Yeah, sure. No problem.
What are you doing?
I thought you don't share food?
Sure I do.
Coulis?
No. If I can't have your clams,
you can't have my dessert.
This is a two-way street.
Really?
Really.
Now this all better be here when I come back.
Yeah, of course. I can control myself.
Stop staring at me!
Just a tiny little....
I'm not even sorry.
- Hi.  - Hey.
So these are the preliminary forms for an open adoption.
There's a lot to go over,
but I'll explain as we go through.
- Is that a picture? - Yeah.
It's a sonogram they took of the baby last week.
I thought you might want to see it.
Look, doctor.
Look, before we sign anything,
we really have to talk.
We're not who you think we are.
I don't understand.
The agency must have made a mistake.
My wife is not a reverend,
and I'm not a doctor.
- What? - That's impossible.
I could perform an operation on you
and prove it if you'd like.
I have to check your file. Excuse me.
So who are you?
Our names really are Monica and Chandler. We're from New York.
Yeah, but the important thing to know about us...
...is how much we would care for this little baby.
So you lied to me before?
Well, we "bore false witness."
See? I could be a reverend.
I can't believe this.
But we were hoping that since we told you the truth...
...that you still might consider--
Giving you my baby?
You think I'd give you my child after this?
You don't have to decide now.
If you look at our file--
I don't want to look at your file. This is over.
Erica, wait.
I have nothing to say to you.
Look, you have every reason to be upset.
We did lie.
But only because we've been waiting
and trying to have a baby for so long.
And we don't know how long it's gonna be
before we get another chance again.
Why don't you ask the reverend to pray on it?
Erica, please.
Just consider us.
Ask them to see our file.
Our last name's Bing.
My wife's a chef, and I'm in advertising.
Oh, yeah.
I actually liked you guys.
But it doesn't matter.
Because what you did was wrong.
But you did like us.
And you should.
My wife's an incredible woman.
She is loving, and devoted and caring.
And don't tell her I said this,
but the woman's always right.
I love my wife more than anything in this world.
And it...
It kills me that I can't give her a baby.
I really want a kid.
And when that day finally comes,
I'll learn how to be a good dad.
But my wife...
...she's already there.
She's a mother...
...without a baby.
Please?
You still want that baby?
God bless you, Chandler Bing!
Turns out this sweater is made for a woman.
So why are you still wearing it?
Because it's soft.
Hey, so how was your date?
Not so good.
Well, looks like it's just the two of us tonight,
huh, buddy?
Yeah. And you know what?
We could do a lot worse.
- Yeah. - Yeah.
Joey doesn't share food!
This cake is amazing!
My God,
get a room.
I would get a room with this cake.
I think I could show this cake a good time.
If you had to,
what would you give up,
food or sex?
Sex.
Seriously,
answer faster.
Oh, I'm sorry, honey.
But when she said "sex,"
I wasn't thinking about sex with you.
It's like a giant hug.
Ross, how about you?
Which would you give up?
Food.
How about sex or dinosaurs?
Oh, my God,
it's like Sophie's Choice.
Oh, God.
What about you, Joe?
What would you give up, sex or food?
I don't know, it's too hard.
No, you gotta pick one.
Food. No, sex.
Food. Sex. Food. Sex--
I don't know! Oh, God, I want both!
I want-- I want girls on bread!
Friends S10E10 The One Where Chandler Gets Caught
You gotta see these pictures of Emma.
Oh, how cute!
She looks just like a little doll.
Oh, no, that is a doll.
Oh, thank God,
because that thing's really creepy.
Look, there's Chandler.
Who's the blond?
She's pretty.
He's having an affair.
He is not having an affair!
I'm always right about these things.
No, you're not.
Last week, you thought Ross was trying to kill you.
Well, sorry,
but it's hard to believe
that anyone would tell a story that dull...
...just to tell it.
There's something going on with them.
Look! He's getting into the car with her.
That doesn't mean anything.
Oh, yeah? Well, let's see.
Okay, duck down.
- Hello? - Hi, Chandler. It's Phoebe.
I know that Monica is working today...
...so I was wondering if you wanted to
come to the movies with me and Rachel.
Oh, I have to work too.
Yeah, I'm stuck here at the office all day.
Well, it's a shame that you'll miss the movie...
...because we were gonna see, you know,
either Liar Liar...
...or Betrayal or An Affair to Remember.
Those are all really old.
Okay, then maybe it'll be--
Dude, Where's My Car?
- What? - They're in a car.
Okay. Well, talk to you later, okay? Bye.
Okay, quick.
We gotta find a cab and follow them.
Yeah, okay.
Let me just grab my night-vision goggles and my stun gun.
I got them.
- Hey. - Hey. Hi, sweetie.
Hey, you smell like perfume and cigarettes.
I was in the car with Nancy.
Nancy doesn't smoke.
Well, at least the perfume's not mine.
Be thankful for that.
So.... What did you think of the house?
It's everything we've been looking for.
Isn't it? And what about the amazing wanes coating...
...the crown molding and the dormer windows in the attic?
And the wiggle woms and the zip zorps!
What were the things you said?
Don't you love the huge yard?
The fireplace in the bedroom.
And Nancy said it's really underpriced...
...because the guy lost his job
and has to move in with his parents!
This is bringing out a lovely color in you.
So do you think we should get it?
I don't know. What do you think?
I think we should.
I do too.
This is huge.
How bad do you wanna smoke right now?
I don't know what you mean,
giant, talking cigarette.
Phoebe called as I was getting
into Nancy's car.
If she asks you, I was at work all day.
Got you. When do we tell them?
We don't. Not until it's 100 percent.
Why upset everybody over nothing?
Okay. Right.
Oh, my God, that is gonna be so hard.
I know. Good luck with it.
I just can't see Chandler cheating.
I'm telling you guys, we followed them
out to a house in Westchester.
They went in for 45 minutes,
and then they came out looking pretty happy.
Chandler?
Forty-five minutes?
Well, something's not right.
I can't believe he'd do this to Monica.
I know, and with the baby coming?
So should we tell her?
I don't know.
Phoebe, if one of us saw Mike with another woman,
would you want us to tell you?
Why? Who'd you see him with?
No one. I'm just saying if we did--
Tell me what you know!
No one! Nothing!
Mike's a great guy! It was hypothetical!
All right. He is a good guy.
You're right. He wouldn't cheat.
If I did see him with someone,
there's no way l--
Who did you see him with?
Oh, look at her. So happy.
If only there were a smaller one
to clean this one.
Hey, is Chandler here?
No, he's picking up dinner.
Why? What's up?
Look, whatever happens,
we're here for you, and we love you.
All right.
Chandler might be having an affair.
What?
Phoebe and I saw Chandler...
...with a blond woman today
outside on the street.
And then we followed them
to a house in Westchester.
They went in together.
I'm so sorry.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, that's awful.
What did you think of the house?
What?
Monica, you understand
what we're saying, right?
Yeah. Sure.
I mean, I'm devastated, obviously.
Did you think the neighborhood was homey?
Hey.
You son of a bitch.
Is it me,
or have the greetings
gone downhill around here?
Phoebe and Rachel saw you
with Nancy today.
They think you're having an affair.
Who's Nancy?
What's going on?
Okay....
All right, you better sit down.
This is-- This is pretty big.
Yeah.
I'm not having an affair.
Nancy is our realtor.
I knew he couldn't be with a woman
for 45 minutes!
Why do you have a realtor?
She's been showing us houses
outside of the city.
What?
Are you serious?
When we found out
that we were gonna get this baby...
...Chandler and I decided
we didn't want to raise a kid in the city.
So you're-- So you're gonna move?
Oh, my God.
Shouldn't we all vote on stuff like this?
What is wrong with raising a kid in the city?
I'm doing it.
Ross is doing it.
Sarah Jessica Parker is doing it!
And that's great for you guys,
but we want a lawn and a swing set.
A street where our kids
can ride their bikes...
...and maybe an ice-cream truck can go by.
So you want to buy a house in the '50s.
Have you thought about
what you're giving up?
You can't move out of the city. What if--?
What if you want Chinese food at 5 a.m.?
Or a fake Rolex
that breaks as soon as it rains?
Or an Asian hooker
sent right to your door?
You know what?
If you want to look for a house, that's okay.
No! No, it's not! Don't listen to him.
I'm gonna thump you.
It's okay,
because they have to get it out of their system.
Okay? But you're gonna realize
this is the only place you want to be.
Actually...
...we already found a house we love.
What?
About an hour ago,
we made an offer.
Bet you wish I was having
an affair now, huh?
You put an offer on a house?
It's so sweet.
It really is.
It has this big yard
that leads down to this stream.
And then there's these old maple trees.
Oh, again with the nature.
What are you, beavers?
Look, I know this is really hard,
and we're really sorry.
Is this because I come over here
without knocking and eat your food?
Because I can stop doing that.
I really, really think I can.
You know that's not the reason, Joe.
I think if you saw it,
you'd understand.
You guys were there.
It's beautiful, isn't it?
Yeah, it is.
What the hell are you doing?
Well, it is, all right?
When we were out there today,
all I kept thinking was:
"l can't believe Chandler's
screwing this woman...
...but, man, this would be a nice place to live!"
Yeah, but so is this.
Yeah. I mean,
if you move there,
you have to leave here.
I mean, how can you leave this place?
Come on, Daddy, listen!
All my life, everyone's always told me,
"You're a shoe!"
"You're a shoe!
You're a shoe.
You're a shoe!"
I stopped and said,
"What if I don't want to be a shoe?
What if I want to be a purse?
Or a hat?"
I don't want you to buy me a hat, l--
I'm saying I am a ha-
It's a metaphor, Daddy!
You can see where he'd have trouble.
Well, maybe I'll just stay here with Monica.
I guess we've established
she's staying with Monica.
Your money's mine, Greene.
Your fly's open, Geller.
You know what I just realized?
"Joker" is "poker" with a "J"!
Coincidence?
That's "joincidence" with a "C"!
Look!
Ugly Naked Guy lit a bunch of candles.
That had to hurt!
Hey, it's your Thanksgiving too.
Instead of watching football,
you could help.
We know.
Rachel, you want to put the marshmallows
in concentric circles.
No, Mon.
You want to put them in concentric circles.
I want to do this.
Every year.
It's stuck!
Step.
How did it get on?
I put it on to scare Chandler.
Oh, my God!
Monica's going to totally freak out!
Plus, it smells really bad in here.
Of course it smells bad.
You have your head up a turkey's ass.
Monica.
Did you get the turkey--?
Oh, my God!
Who is that?
It's Joey.
I got it!
If we win,
they have to get rid of the rooster.
That's interesting!
If you win...
...we give up the bird.
But if we win...
...we get your apartment.
- Deal! - What?
"What was Monica's nickname
when she was a hockey goalie?"
- Big Fat Goalie. - Correct!
"Rachel claims it's her favorite movie."
Dangerous Liaisons.
Correct, "Her actual favorite movie is...?"
Weekend at Bernie's.
"Monica categorizes her towels.
How many categories are there?"
- Everyday use. - Fancy.
- Guest. - Fancy guest.
- Two seconds. - Eleven?
Eleven! Unbelievable! Eleven is correct.
"Chandler was how old
when he first touched a girl's breast?"
- 14? - No, 19.
Thanks, man.
"Joey had an imaginary childhood friend.
- His name was...?" - Maurice!
Correct! "His profession was...?"
Space cowboy!
"What is Chandler Bing's job?"
Ten seconds.
You need this or you lose.
Something to do with transponding.
He's a transpons...transponster!
That's not even a word!
You are mean boys
who are just being mean!
Don't get mad!
No one forced you to raise the stakes.
That is not true! She forced me!
Hey, we would still be living here
if you hadn't gotten the question wrong!
It was a stupid, unfair question!
Don't blame the questions!
Stop yelling in our apartment!
You are ruining moving day for us.
Chandler!
I saw what you were doing in the window!
I saw what you're doing to my sister!
Get out here!
Listen, we had a good run.
What was it? Four, five months?
I mean that's more
than most people have in a lifetime.
So, goodbye, take care, byebye.
Hey, Ross.
What's up, bro?
What the hell are you doing?
What's going on?
I think...I think Ross knows about me and Monica.
Dude, he's right there.
I thought you were my best friend!
This is my sister!
My best friend and my sister!
I cannot believe this!
We're not just messing around.
I love her.
I'm in love with her.
I'm so sorry
that you had to find out this way.
I'm sorry, but it's true.
I love him too.
My best friend and my sister!
I cannot believe this!
This is the last box of your clothes.
I'm just gonna label it
"What were you thinking?"
I was gonna go across the hall
and write that on Chandler.
Guys, I don't mean to make things worse, but...
...l don't want to live with Rachel anymore.
-What? -What?
You're so mean to each other.
I don't wanna end up like that with Rachel.
I still like you.
That's fine because I'm not moving.
Phoebe, you gotta take her.
You know, I know I said some bad stuff...
...but Rachel has qualities
that make her a good roommate.
She gets tons of catalogs and she folds
she folds down the pages of things she thinks I'd like.
What else?
When I take a shower...
...she leaves me notes on the mirror.
I do. I do do that.
That's nice.
I like having things to read in the bathroom.
When I fall asleep on the couch...
...she covers me with a blanket.
Well, you know, I don't want you to be cold.
And when I told her
that I was gonna move in with Chandler...
...she was really supportive.
You were so great.
You made it so easy.
And now you have to leave.
And I have to live with a boy!
- She really left. - I know.
- Thank you. - No problem, roomie.
- Can I ask you a question? - Sure.
What the hell is that dog doing here?
A little toast here. Ding, ding!
I know this isn't exactly
the kind of Thanksgiving you planned...
...but for me this has been really great.
You know, I think because
it didn't involve divorce...
...or projectile vomiting.
Anyway, I think if
you had gone to Vail...
...or if you had been with your family,
or if you didn't have...
...syphilis and stuff...
...we wouldn't be all together.
So I guess what I'm trying to say is...
...that I'm very thankful
that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.
- That's so sweet! - Thank you.
Here's to a lousy Christmas!
And a crappy New Year!
Hear, hear!
You can't move.
You just-- You just can't.
Rachel's right.
This is where you guys belong.
Yeah.You don't wanna live in Westchester.
That's the worst of the Chesters.
You know,
sometimes when I'm alone in my apartment,
I look over here...
...and you guys are just having dinner...
...or watching TV or something...
...but it makes me feel better.
And now when I look over,
who am I gonna see?
The Gottliebs? The Yangs?
They don't make me feel so good.
Yeah. So don't move, okay?
Just stay here...
...and maybe close your blinds at night.
Hey.
Hello?
It's Nancy. They responded to our offer.
And?
Okay. Thanks.
They passed.
They said they won't go a penny under the asking price.
- We can't afford that. - I know.
Well, there you go.
I'm really sorry, you guys.
Yeah, I'm sorry too.
I'm even more sorry that phone call didn't come...
...before I told you about looking through the window.
Yeah. Well, we're gonna let you be alone.
You gonna be okay?
Yeah, we'll be okay.
Love you guys.
You know, I'm really sorry
I wasn't more supportive before.
That's okay.
We understand.
Yeah, and about this Nancy....
If you're not sleeping with her, should l?
I know there'll be other houses, but I just--
- I love that one so much. - Yeah.
Well, it's a good thing we got it then.
- What? - We got the house.
Oh, my God.
I didn't wanna tell you in front of them.
Oh my god, we got it?! We got the house?!
We're getting a house!
- We're getting a house. - And a baby.
We're growing up.
We sure are.
- Who's gonna tell them? - Not it!
Not it! Damn it!
Rachel, this is yours.
Why? What are these for?
You'll see.
All right, everybody open them.
Wow, this is so beautiful!
These are the ones I was looking at in the store!
- I know. - Oh, I love this!
A meatball sub!
Thanks!
Seriously, guys, what's going on?
What are these for?
Well, I didn't know how to tell you before...
- ...but we got the house. - Enjoy!
What did they say?
Hey, guys--
Wait! Let me tell them.
- Sure. - Joey's gonna be...
...a celebrity guest on a game show.
Really? Which one?
Fish. Seaweed.
- A sunken ship. - Things you find in the ocean.
- You're gonna be on Pyramid! - Yeah.
That was our favorite game show ever.
Except for Match Game.
Or Win, Lose or Draw.
What did I marry into?
You guys wanna come
and watch me tape the show?
Oh, we can't.
We're throwing Phoebe a bachelorette party.
Yeah. Sorry, boys, this ride's closing.
And Chandler and I have this stupid college alumni thing.
I can't believe you get to meet Donny Osmond.
Seriously?
Ross and I
always wanted to be Donny and Marie.
You guys just keep getting cooler and cooler.
Yeah, we used to perform
for our family and friends.
Oh, God, that's right. I blocked that out.
I'm leaving you.
Friends S10E11 The One Where The Stripper Cries
It's so weird to
see all these people again.
Oh, my God, look.
There's Jeffrey Klarik.
Who?
He was roommates with John Rosoff.
He went out with Andrea Tamborino.
She dumped him for Michael Skloff.
Did I go to this school?
Hey, there's Missy Goldberg.
You gotta remember her.
Sure. Nice.
Dude, you're married to my sister.
You're right.
By saying "nice,"
I'm virtually licking her.
Hey, I hear she's single again.
You think I should ask her out?
Are you asking permission
to break the pact?
Yes, please.
Hey. Hey, check out the fliers for the band.
I made them on a Macintosh in the computer room.
Awesome.
The name really stands out.
Thanks to a little something called Helvetica Bold 24-point.
Man, we're gonna rock that Asian Student Union.
- Hey, guys. - Hey, Missy.
Our band is playing on Friday.
Yeah, you should come check us out.
We're called Way/No Way.
- No way. - Way.
- Great. I'll be there. - Fresh.
- Boss. - Mint.
- She's gone. - I know it.
I am totally gonna ask her out.
Dude, I was gonna ask her out.
I said it first, bro.
Well, I thought it first, Homes.
Look, if you date--
Wait! Wait! What are we doing?
What we have is too important
to mess it up over some girl.
I mean, we can get laid any time we want.
Totally.
I had sex in high schoo.
Me too. I'm good at it.
All right, I say we make a pact.
Neither of us will go out with Missy Goldberg.
You got it.
That's Missy Goldberg, Phoebe Cates
and Molly Ringwald...
...who we can't go out with.
Those are the pacts.
And Sheena Easton.
But we probably couldn't get her anyway.
Maybe not you.
Well, I officially give you permission
to break the pact.
Thank you.
All right. Here I go.
Hey, remember how scary it used to be
going up to girls in college?
Your hands are shaking.
I know. And I can't stop sweating.
Five, four, three. Applause.
Yeah!
Welcome.
It is Soap Opera Week here on Pyramid.
Let's meet our contestants.
First, Gene Lester is a database specialist.
He's gonna be playing with
Days of Our Lives star
Joey Tribbiani.
I know it can be intimidating
for regular people to be around celebrities...
...but relax.
I'm just like you,
only better-looking and richer.
She'll be playing with
star of General Hospital, Leslie Charleson.
Welcome, everybody. Good luck to all of you.
Let's play Pyramid.
All right? Now, we flipped a coin
before the show.
Gene, you won the toss, so you'll start.
Which category would you like?
I will take "You Crossed the Line."
"You Crossed the Line." Joey...
...describe for Gene these things that have lines.
Give me 20 seconds on the clock, please.
Ready? Go.
Okay, it's a store like a supermarket.
I see what I did there.
Okay, okay. I'm writing in my....
Diary.
No, more like a notebook.
If I'm building a house, the plan...
...isn't called a "shmooprint" ....
I can't do that either?
In high school,
I once had sex with a girl
right in the middle of the...?
Cafeteria?
Yeah, but they're not looking for that.
Thank you so much for this.
You like it?
Oh, my God, it's all so elegant.
When's the dirty stuff starting?
What?
You know.
The strippers and the guys dancing...
...and, you know, pee-pees flying about.
Pheebs, l....
There isn't gonna be any "flying about."
We actually thought we were a little too mature
for stuff like that.
Oh, okay.
I see what you're doing. That's fine.
This is all there is. Just tea. Okay.
Raunchy.
Seriously, Pheebs,
it's not gonna be that kind of a party.
Really? So this is...?
This is my big sendoff into married life?
Rachel, this is the only bachelorette party I'm ever gonna have.
I've got a big wad of ones in my purse.
Really? I mean, really? It's just tea?
No.
Phoebe, of course there's more.
Okay.
I mean, let me just go talk to Monica...
...and get an ETA on the pee-pees.
Now, Gene, I must remind you,
you need all six of these to stay in the game.
Describe for Joey
"things you find in your refrigerator."
They might as well just give us the points.
Give me 20 seconds on the clock.
Ready? Go.
You put this in your coffee.
A spoon. Your hands. Your face.
It's white.
Paper. Snow. A ghost!
It's heavier than milk.
A rock. A dog. The Earth.
Pass.
You put it on a sandwich.
Salami. Anchovies. Jam.
It's white.
Paper. Snow. A ghost!
It's made from eggs.
Chickens?
Pass.
You put this on a hamburger.
Ketchup! Relish!
Stop!
Oh, time's up. Well,
Joey, you were...
...almost on a roll there. Gene...
...you'll have a chance to go to the Winner's Circle,
but now...
...Henrietta,
you're going to the Winner's Circle to try your luck for $ 10,000...
...right after this. Don't go away.
And we're out.
Oh, so we didn't win.
But it's fun to play the game, right?
I got a kid starting college.
I have to get surgery on my knee.
You just lost me 10 grand.
Oh, wow.
I'm so sorry.
Okay, I promise, we'll do better next time.
Well, I will,
because I won't be playing with you.
Hey, some of those are pretty hard.
Like, why would there be a ghost in my fridge?
Yeah.
- So Saturday night? - I'd love to.
Great.
So how come it took you so long to ask me out?
Oh, well, this is gonna sound kind of silly...
...but do you remember my roommate, Chandler Bing?
Sure. He was in your "band."
It's been 16 years,
but the air quotes still hurt.
Sorry.
That's okay. Anyway....
Well, he and I both really liked you a lot...
...but we didn't want it
to jeopardize our friendship,
so we made a pact...
...that neither of us could ask you out.
- Really? - Yeah, why?
Well, Chandler and I used to make out.
A lot.
- You did? - Yeah.
We'd go to the science lab after-hours.
And on my turf?!
Hey, where is this guy?
It's been over an hour.
He's coming from Jersey.
He said he'd get here as fast as he could.
- Who is it? - It's the police.
The police!
That's right. It's Officer Goodbody.
What's the matter, officer?
Has someone been bad?
That's a lot of stairs.
Boy.
You should warn people there's no elevator.
I should not have had that Mexican food for lunch.
Are you gonna be okay, Officer...?
Goodbody.
If you say so.
So where's the young lady...
...who I am supposed to take downtown?
Oh, God.
Somebody show me where to plug in my box...
...and we'll get this party started.
- Over here? - Yeah.
- All right. - Rachel?
- Yeah? - Are you kidding?
We didn't know you wanted a stripper,
so we went to the phone book...
...and got the first name we could find.
How old's your phone book?
Oh, my God,
this man is gonna get naked in my apartment.
God, no.
I don't wanna see him take his clothes off.
Are you talking about me?
No.
I mean, obviously we wanna see you take your clothes off.
You big piece of eye candy.
Okay. Okay, ladies,
can I have your attention, please?
Oh, yeah.
Did someone call for the long arm of the law?
I should warn you,
I have a concealed weapon.
I hope you're familiar with this state's penal code.
Okay, okay. Enough teasing.
Now for some pleasing.
She cringed.
This is how I look when I'm turned-on.
You were talking about me before.
Look, I don't need this.
I'm out of here. Where's my hat?
Look, I've been in this business for a long time.
Shocking.
Now, if you'll just pay me my $300,
I'll be on my way.
$300? Are you kidding?
That's okay. Let me get my checkbook.
No. You're not gonna pay him.
He didn't do anything.
Didn't do anything?
I took a bus all the way from Hoboken.
I climbed, I don't know, like, a billion stairs.
And it's not like
I can take them two at a time.
I don't care.
We're not paying you $300 for this.
It's not my fault
if you're too uptight to appreciate...
...the male form in all its glory.
Okay, I'm uptight.
That's why I don't wanna watch a middle-aged guy...
...dance around in what I can only assume
is a child's Halloween costume.
I may have borrowed this from my nephew...
...but let me assure you,
what's underneath is all man.
I'm sorry,
did you say "all man" or "old man"?
You're mean.
- Look, officer-- Sir? - Damn it.
Big surprise.
The hunk of beef has feelings.
Applause.
Okay, Henrietta,
you picked "Jack and Jill Went Up The Hill."
My friend Rachel has a kid.
I totally know nursery rhymes.
Joey, describe these things associated
with the United States Congress.
Give me 20 seconds on the clock, please.
Ready? Go.
Pass.
Pass.
Pass.
- The thing hanging in your throat. - Uvula.
Then pass.
Okay. Henrietta,
you didn't get all the points you needed...
...so that means,
Gene, you are going to the Winner's Circle to try for $ 10,000.
And you're gonna be going there with Joey Tribbiani.
You made out with Missy Goldberg?
How could you do that after you promised me?
Excuse me.
That didn't make us sound gay at all.
You broke the pact.
Ross, that was 16 years ago.
That doesn't matter.
We're talking about the foundation of our friendship.
I believe the foundation of our friendship was unfortunate hair.
All right, look.
If we're really gonna do this,
it's not like you never broke one of the pacts.
- I didn't. - Oh, really?
- No. - Oh, really?
- No. - Adrienne Turner.
Yes?
- Hey, Adrienne. - Hey, Adrienne. Hey.
I never did anything with Adrienne Turner.
Oh, please.
And you knew how much I liked her.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Really? Remember that party freshman year?
A week before Christmas vacation? I do.
You had some visitors.
I can't believe we're at a real college party.
I have to pee so bad.
This is so awesome.
College guys are so cute.
Hey, you've got a boyfriend.
I know.
But if a guy who looks like Corey Haim wants to kiss me,
I am so gonna let him.
Hey, look, there's Chandler.
That stupid friend of Ross'
who said I was fat.
You know, I've already lost four pounds.
You can so totally tell.
I know!
Well, let's see,
maybe he knows where Ross is.
Hey, how's it going?
- Aren't you...? - Yeah, Rachel.
And this is Ross' sister, Monica.
We met at Thanksgiving.
Right. So how you doing?
Bitchen.
- Hi, Monica. - Hi, Chandler.
It's really nice to see you. Not!
Okay.
I'll see if I can find Ross.
Oh, my God, Rach. Beanbag chairs.
Do not let me sit in one of those.
We'll be here for days.
Listen, Adrienne,
you can't tell Chandler about this.
Oh, believe me, Ross,
I won't be telling anybody about this.
Cool.
I didn't know you knew about that.
Well, I did. And it hurt.
That's when I wrote the song "Betrayal in the Common Room."
Man, I'm sorry.
Look, that was a long time ago.
So I made out with Adrienne,
and you made out with Missy.
Well, I guess we're even.
We are even, right?
One more thing.
I was so pissed at you that night,
I wanted to get back at you.
So I thought,
"Who does Ross like more than anybody?"
What did you do to my mom?
Not her.
I am so drunk.
That's weird.
I've had the same number of beers as you
and don't feel anything.
So you girls having fun?
For your information, ass-munch...
...I've lost four pounds.
Maybe even five with all the dancing.
- Somebody order a pizza? - Oh, that's me!
I am so not gonna do good on my SATs tomorrow.
Well, maybe you could go to school here next year
and we could totally hang out.
Oh, yeah. There's a plan.
Why don't I just start taking my smart pills now.
Well, maybe you could get in on a beauty scholarship.
What a line.
- So where are you applying to? - Well...
You know,l think it's kind of really important
that I go somewhere where there's sun.
So I'm sort of-- Hey!
I'm in college, and I'm in a band.
Yeah, okay.
What's the matter?
You never saw
a 50-year-old stripper cry before?
You know, it's fine.
We'll pay you.
No, no, you're right.
Who am I kidding?
I should have hung up that breakaway jockstrap years ago.
What am I gonna do? I mean...
...this has been my life for 32 years.
Taking my clothes off in front of people is all I know.
No, wait, there's got to be something else that you can do.
I mean, what skills do you have?
I don't know.
I can make my pecs dance.
I can pick up a dollar bill with my butt cheeks.
I can go to that special place inside me
where I feel no shame.
So maybe something in an office.
Or you could-- You could teach stripping.
You know, share your gift. Pass the torch.
You know, actually, that's not a bad idea.
I could do it out of my apartment.
I don't think my mom would mind.
There you go.
Okay. You think you're gonna be okay?
- Yeah. Yeah. - Yeah.
This is so weird.
You never know when it's gonna be
your last dance.
And I didn't even get a chance to finish it.
Finish it.
- What? - Your last dance. Do it for us.
- Really? - Really?
Yeah. Yeah, he deserves to do
the thing he loves one last time.
Okay. All right. Get ready, ladies.
Okay.
Oh, this is so hot!
Oh, no, don't stop.
Have to.
Welcome to the Winner's Circle.
Joey, Gene, you guys ready?
- Yeah. - Sure.
Okay. Give me 60 seconds on the clock, please.
Ready? Go.
Oak. Maple. Elm. Birch.
I don't know. Types of trees...?
Buenos dias. Enchilada. Por favor.
Oh, I'm so sorry, I don't know any Spanish words.
A match. A candle.
Things that go: when you put them out.
A torch. A bonfire.
- Your pee. - Things that burn.
"I'd like to go for a walk."
"Scratch my belly."
Dude. Dude, I think you're losing it.
"I have fur." "I like to bark."
What a dog says.
- Pepperoni. - Pizza toppings!Next.
Cindy Crawford. Christie Brinkley.
Heidi Klum. Claudia Schiffer.
Christy Turlington. Kate Moss.
Girls Chandler could never get?
- Supermodels. - Where?
Hey. Where's Rachel?
She and Phoebe took the stripper to the hospital.
Did you know Chandler kissed Rachel?
What? When was this?
1987.
The weekend you guys visited me at school.
Oh, my God. That's wild.
But it was, like, a million years ago.
- It doesn't matter. - It matters to me.
Why?
Because the night you kissed Rachel...
...was the night I kissed Rachel for the very first time.
You kissed her that night too?
Two guys in one night?
Oh, I thought she became a slut
after she got her nose fixed.
Seriously, where did this happen?
Okay...
...after you told me she was passed out in our room...
...l went in there to make sure she was all right.
She was lying on my bed,
all buried in people's coats.
I went to kiss her on the forehead...
...but it was so dark,
I accidentally got her lips.
I started to pull away,
but then I felt her start to kiss me back.
It was only for a second, but it was amazing.
And now I find out that you kissed her first.
Wait, what bed did you say she was on?
Mine.
I'm sure I put her on my bed.
No, she was definitely on my bed.
Why would I kiss a girl and then put her on your bed?
Well, then who was on my bed?
Oh, oh, oh...
No! No! No!
Yes!
You were under the pile of coats?
I was the pile of coats!
Oh, my God!
You were my midnight mystery kisser?!
You were my first kiss with Rachel?!
You were my first kiss ever?!
What did I marry into?!
Crap!
- Oh, hey, Joey. - Mmm.
- Hey. - Listen, I need to ask you something.
You know how my stepdad's in prison?
- Yeah. - Yeah.
He was supposed to get a weekend furlough so he could go to the wedding.
But he just called and...
Well, apparently stabbing Iceman in the exercise yard couldn't wait till Monday.
- So he can't come? - No.
And so there's no one to walk me down the aisle. And...
Well, I would just really love it if you would do it.
- Seriously? - Yeah.
You've, you know, sort of been like a dad to me.
You've always, you know, looked out for me and shared your wisdom.
I am pretty "wisdomous."
So, what do you say?
Are you kidding? Phoebe, I would be honored.
PHOEBE: Oh, thank you.
I hope...
I hope you know how much you mean to me.
Listen, I hope...
I hope that you know...
I don't want you to see your father cry. Go to your room!
Friends S10E12 The One With Phoebe's Wedding
- Oh. - Oh, no, no, no. Let your dad get this.
Oh. It's my wedding planner. She's driving me crazy!
Hello? Okay, stop screaming!
Okay, so halibut.
All right, so salmon. Either way. I don't...
- It doesn't matter to me. - Well, it matters to me!
Well, I don't care. So you pick.
Did you just hang up on me?
All right, look, I need you at the rehearsal dinner tonight at 1800 hours.
Okay. What time is that?
You don't know military time?
I must have been in missile training the day they taught that.
Just subtract 12.
Okay, so 1800 minus 12...
...is 1788.
- Six o'clock! - Okay.
Hold on. Yeah? Geller here.
No, I said it has to be there by 4:00. Goodbye.
How hard is it to make an ice sculpture?
That sounds really fancy.
I told you, I just want a simple wedding.
Please, honey, leave the details to me.
Now, I wanna make this day as special for you as I can.
I was thinking the harpist should wear white.
Harpist? My friend Marjorie is playing the steel drums.
- Oh, she backed out. - She did? Why?
I made her.
Steel drums don't really say "elegant wedding."
- Nor does Marjorie's overwhelming scent. - Hey!
She will shower when Tibet is free.
CHANDLER: Hey. You look great. PHOEBE: You too.
I'm glad we're having a rehearsal dinner. I rarely practice my meals before I eat.
What did we say was your one gift to us?
No stupid jokes, but I thought that was for the actual wedding.
Rehearse it.
Hi.
- Thanks for coming, you guys. - Oh, yeah...
I was... I was going for a handshake.
That why your hand's against my crotch?
- That is why. MIKE: Yeah.
So, Rach, where's Emma?
Monica made me send her to my mom's.
Apparently, babies and weddings don't mix.
Are you still crying about your damn baby?
Pheebs, you got to keep the line moving. Remember, 20 seconds per person.
You see these clowns all the time.
- Hey, you're Mike's parents, right? - Yes, we are.
Gosh, our little ones are growing up fast, aren't they?
- How's that? - You know...
...on one hand, you're happy for them. On the other, it's hard to let go.
Who in God's name are you?
I'm not that fond of you either, buddy. I'm just trying to be nice for the kids.
You know what? We have no idea what we're doing in the wedding tomorrow.
I thought we'd be groomsmen. They would have asked us by now.
When did they ask you to be a bridesmaid?
- November. - I wanna say it's not looking good.
- Hey, Pheebs? - Huh?
You haven't told these guys what they're doing in the wedding yet.
Um, well, they're not in the wedding.
What?
Well...
...this is really awkward.
Oh, and I can leave.
I'm sorry, you guys. But Mike's got his brother and his friends from school.
So, you know, you were...
If it helps, you were next in line. You just missed the cut.
Oh, man.
This is like figure skating team all over again.
I mean, synchronized swimming.
I mean... I mean, the balance beam.
- Help me. - Football.
Thank you.
Oh, Pheebs, spit that out. That has pork in it.
Oh! Oh!
I thought the pot stickers were supposed to be vegetarian?
Yeah, I changed them. I sent you a fax about it.
I don't have a fax machine.
Huh. Well, then there are gonna be a few surprises.
I can't believe we're gonna be the only people not in the wedding.
- I know. I hate being left out of things. - And it's a wedding.
It'll be weird if I'm not in it.
- Hey, guys, how's it going? - Fine.
We're sitting here, alone, doing nothing. It's our rehearsal for tomorrow.
Look, about tomorrow, I've got a question for you.
I found out one of my groomsmen had an emergency and can't make it.
- What happened? - Who cares? And?
And I was wondering if one of you guys...
- I'll do it! - Me!
You both wanna do it? There's only room for one.
Pick me. I look great in a tux, and I won't steal focus.
No, Mike. No, no, you wanna pick me. I mean... Watch.
Huh?
You know, I really don't feel very comfortable making this decision.
You know, Phoebe knows you better. I'm gonna let her choose.
Well, if Phoebe's choosing, then say hello to Mike's next groomsman.
Oh, I will. But I will need a mirror...
...as he is me.
- Please. You're going down. - You are going "downer."
They say that on the figure skating team?
I wouldn't know. I didn't make it.
You know I'm filling in for Phoebe's stepdad tomorrow, right?
- Yeah. Yeah. Hey, thanks for doing that. - Oh, hey, my pleasure.
So, what are your intentions with my Phoebe?
- I intend to marry her. - Oh, a wiseacre.
I understand you plan to support your wife by playing the piano?
Isn't that kind of unstable?
- No more so than acting. - Strike two.
You're right. She probably will support me.
Hey, unless we move in with you, Dad.
Strike three.
You only get one more, Mike.
So? What did you decide?
I decided to pee.
You have to choose one of us to be in your wedding.
- One of the groomsmen fell out. - Oh, no, no.
I can't choose between you two. I love you both so much.
Just not enough to put us in the original wedding party.
But I don't wanna choose. It's...
- Okay, wait. Rach? - Yeah?
Listen, I have a very special bridesmaid task for you to do.
Goody! What is it?
Well, there's a spot open for only one groomsman...
...and you have to choose between Ross and Chandler. So good luck with that.
What? What, what, what? No, I don't wanna do that.
I guess I have to find a new bridesmaid.
I'll do it!
Okay, it's 2100 hours.
- Time for your toast. - Do I have time to go to the bathroom?
You had a bathroom break at 2030. Pee on your own time, Mike.
In regards to the toasts, okay, you wanna keep them short.
Nothing kills a rehearsal dinner like long speeches. Okay.
You just get in, do your thing, and get out.
Is that what you say to Chandler?
It's 2101, and I am not amused.
Okay.
The bride and groom have a few words they'd like to say.
Okay. Hello, everyone.
And thank you all for being here tonight. So tomorrow's the big event.
Some of you might not know, but Mike and I didn't get off to the best start.
Yeah. My friend Joey and I...
...decided to fix each other up with friends. So I...
Oh, okay. I...
I thought about it, and I fixed him up with my friend Mary Ellen...
...who couldn't be here tonight, because... It's not...
It's not important. Well, she's in rehab.
Anyway. So Joey said that he was fixing me up with his friend Mike...
...only he didn't have a friend Mike, so he just brought my Mike. And... And...
[CLEARS THROAT]
But despite, you know... It got good.
I wanna take a moment to mention my mother, who couldn't be here.
Oh, God.
And... And moment's over.
So okay... Oh, no, forget that.
I can forget that. Oh, this is funny.
Oh, but you need to know that to get that.
So... Oh, well, okay.
I... Okay.
Okay, Monica, I can't do it like this!
This is my wedding, okay? I don't want this...
Or this... Or this...
Okay? I just wanted a simple wedding...
...where my fiancé can go to the bathroom any time he wants!
- You know what? You're done. - What?
You're fired!
Cheers.
- Hey. - Happy wedding day.
Happy my wedding day to you.
Joey, listen, this is gonna be bridesmaid central, all right?
We're gonna have hair and makeup in the bathroom.
I had to move a couple things in the fridge to make room for the corsages.
Man! I wouldn't have had breakfast if I knew there was gonna be corsages.
Hi.
About last night...
I know you're under a lot of stress, and...
Well, even though the things you said hurt me a little bit...
My point is...
Well, I'm willing to take my job back.
Oh, well, that's okay.
I think you and I will do much better if you're just here as a bridesmaid.
Oh, is that so?
Okay.
If that's really what you want, then here.
I give you the headset. I don't really wanna give you the headset.
I guess if you're taking over, then you should probably return these messages.
- This is a lot. - Uh-huh.
But I'm sure you can handle this. I have won awards...
...for my organizational skills. But I'm sure you'll do fine.
- You've won awards? - I printed them out on my computer.
- Hey. - Hi.
- Where's Rach? - She's in her room. Why?
I have to talk to her about this groomsman situation.
I'm not gonna watch Chandler up there while I'm in the seats like some chump.
My God, you're breathtaking.
What do you want?
You haven't by any chance chosen a groomsman yet, have you?
Ross, please don't make this harder than it already is.
I'm not. I'm making it easier. Pick me.
- Chandler said it's important to him too. - Listen. Listen.
Whoever you pick is gonna walk down the aisle with you.
Now, I promise I won't say a word. But if you pick Chandler...
...he's gonna be whispering stupid jokes in your ear the whole time.
Oh, you are the lesser of two evils.
Yes!
Sven, I don't understand what you're saying. What is wrong with the flowers?
"Lorkins"? What the hell are "lorkins"?
I know.
- Hey. - Mike, if you were Swedish...
...and you were saying the word "lorkins," what flower would that be?
- Orchids? - Right there!
That's why I'm marrying you.
Hello, Michael.
Joseph.
May I have a word with you, please?
This is...
...great.
Have a seat.
Last night...
...I tried to welcome you into my family.
And instead, you disrespect me.
I cannot allow this.
Are you rehearsing for some really bad Mafia movie?
More back talk.
And yes, I may be borrowing a few lines from my recent unsuccessful audition...
...for Family Honor 2: This A-Time It's A-Personal.
Joey, I kind of have a lot to do today. What do you want?
I want you to take this seriously!
Phoebe is very, very important to me, okay?
I wanna make sure you are gonna take care of her.
Joe, I love Phoebe.
She's the most important thing in my life.
I'd die before I let anything happen to her.
That's what I wanted to hear.
Because she's family, okay?
And now you're gonna be family.
And there's nothing more important in the whole world than family.
That must have been one lousy movie.
That was me!
- Hi. - Let's talk about this groomsman thing.
If you pick Ross, he'll walk you down the aisle just fine.
But if you choose me...
...you'll be getting some comedy.
Even so...
...I think I'm gonna pick Ross.
Okay.
See, when I was a kid, you know, I was always left out of everything...
...and it really made me feel insecure.
I was always picked last in gym...
...even behind that fat exchange student who didn't know the rules to baseball.
I mean, this guy would strike out and then run to third.
Anyway, if I'm the only one left out of this wedding...
...I just know that all those feelings are gonna come rushing back.
All right, fine, I pick you.
Yes!
Make "groom" for Chandler.
Oh, my.
No, we're gonna do it my way. Because your way is stupid.
All right, I got to go. I have another call, Reverend.
Hello?
- I'm glad we had this little talk. - Yes.
And thanks for all the wedding night advice.
That didn't make me uncomfortable at all.
All right, so I'll see everybody tonight.
- Okay. - Bye.
Did you guys know that there's a giant ice sculpture in the hall?
PHOEBE: Oh, my God, what's it doing here?
I guess it got sent to the billing address as opposed to the shipping address.
- What a pickle. - Oh, my God, everything's such a mess.
Why is this happening to me?
How bad do you wanna stick your tongue on that?
- How's it going? ROSS: Good.
I'm just getting some coffee so I'm alert for the wedding.
That's what I was doing too.
Well, you have fun tonight.
- You too. - Oh, I will.
Me too.
Wait a minute. I know why I'm being such an ass. Why are you?
- I'm not supposed to tell you. - I'm not supposed to tell you.
You told us both we could be in the wedding?
In my defense, you weren't supposed to tell each other!
Rachel, only one of us can do it. You have to choose.
You and me together again.
Rach, Rach? Knock-knock.
- Who's there? - I'll tell you at the wedding.
Hey, I forgot my scarf.
I can't do this. I don't know which one of you guys to pick.
Oh, you haven't picked yet? Oh, good, because I had an idea.
I thought it would be fun if the third groomsman was my family dog, Chappy.
What? A dog? No. Rachel gets to choose.
Wow, this is a tough one.
I think I'm gonna have to go with the dog.
So, what you're saying is that the chef is at the Hamilton Club...
...but the food is not? And the drinks are there but the bartender is not?
Are you freaking kidding me?
How's it going?
- Help me. - What?
I want you to be crazy bitch again.
Really?
Please?
- You really want me to come back? - More than I wanna get married.
Okay, people, we are back in business!
Oh, God, I have missed you so much. Okay.
Get your hair and makeup done. I'll take care of everything.
- Hey, what are you guys gonna do? - About what?
The blizzard. I just saw on the news...
...it's the worst snowstorm in 20 years.
They already closed all the bridges and tunnels.
But the band and the photographer are coming in from New Jersey.
I don't think they are.
Ha-ha! Looks like you're not gonna be in the wedding, either.
So sorry, Pheebs.
- Well, the club lost its power. - The news said most of the city did.
- Since when do you watch the news? - For your information...
...since they hired a very hot weather girl.
I can't believe you aren't getting married today.
PHOEBE: I know.
It's so beautiful out there. You always wanted to get married outside.
- Why don't you just do it on the street? - What?
Well, look, it's hardly snowing anymore.
I mean, you couldn't ask for a more romantic setting.
This could be the simple wedding you've always wanted.
What do you think?
I think I wanna get married to you today.
Me too. Monica, do you think we could do it?
Affirmative!
Okay, let's get these chairs out here!
Gunther, hit the Christmas lights.
Ah.
Okay, who left the ice sculpture on the steam grate?
MRS. HANNIGAN: Michael. MIKE: Hey, you made it. Great. Chappy!
- There you go. MIKE: Hi. Hi.
I know getting married in the street isn't what you approve of.
No, it's lovely. The lights and the snow. I could look at them forever.
I crushed a pill and put it in her drink.
Come on, sweetheart.
You know, Chappy's too small to handle all this snow.
Someone has to walk him down the aisle.
- Would this person be in the wedding? - I guess.
- I'll do it! - I'll do it!
Chandler, hello? I mean, aren't you scared of dogs?
I'm not scared. I'll just take little Chappy and...
He can sense my fear! My throat is exposed!
Well, I guess I'm in the wedding then.
He stinks.
Level one alert! I repeat, level one, this is not a drill!
We have a situation. The minister called. He's snowed in, he can't make it.
- Oh, no. - Hey, don't worry.
- I'm still ordained from your wedding. - Really?
Yeah. You think I'd give up being a minister and pay to ride the subway?
Ministers don't ride the subway for free.
I had to read the Bible pretty carefully, but, yeah, we do.
We have to find someone else to walk Phoebe down the aisle.
I'll do it!
Okay, Mike and Joey, get in position.
Chandler, come with me.
Okay, Joey's doing the ceremony, and Chandler's giving you away.
Oh, okay. Hi, new Dad.
- So you ready to do this? - Oh, my God. This is really happening.
- Uh-huh. I'm so happy for you, honey. PHOEBE: Thank you.
I love you. Wait, wait! No hugs! The dresses!
- Oh, what the hell. - Oh, come on.
- I love you guys. - I love you.
Okay, it's zero hour! All teams execute on my count!
Let's get this bad boy on the road!
Is it okay I want you to wear that headset in bed?
I have you scheduled for nudity at 2300 hours.
Oh, yeah.
Okay, Marjorie, hit it.
- Jeez, Ross. You could've showered. - It's the dog.
Groomsman? Why are you standing there? Where's your bridesmaid?
We've got a broken arrow! Bridesmaid down!
Oh, that's me.
- Ready? - Okay.
Oh, wait. Oh, no. Wait.
Wow. Aren't you gonna be cold?
I don't care.
I'll be my "something blue."
- You look beautiful. - Thank you.
My God.
- Aren't you freezing? - Nuh-uh.
Friends. Family.
Dog.
Thank you all for being here to witness this blessed event.
The cold has now spread to my special place...
...so I'm gonna do the short version of this.
Phoebe and Mike are perfect for each other.
And I know I speak for everyone here...
...when I wish them a lifetime of happiness.
Who has the rings?
Okay.
When I was growing up, I didn't have a normal mom and dad...
...or a regular family like everybody else.
And I always knew that something was missing.
But now I'm standing here today...
...knowing that I have everything I'm ever gonna need.
You are my family.
Phoebe, you are so beautiful.
You're so kind. You're so generous.
You're so wonderfully weird.
Every day with you is an adventure.
And I can't believe how lucky I am.
And I can't wait to share my life with you forever.
Oh, wait! Oh, I forgot. And...
...I love you.
And you have nice eyes.
I love you too.
- Joey? - Yeah?
Chappy's heart rate has slowed way down.
Okay. Phoebe...
...do you take this man to be your husband?
I do.
Oh...
Mike, do you take this woman to be your wife?
I do.
I now pronounce you...
...husband and wife.
I got married!
Could someone get me a coat? I'm frigging freezing.
- It really was an incredible wedding. - It was.
I kind of don't want it to end. Hey...
...you wanna come in for a drink and a bite of corsage?
I'd love to, but it's 2300 hours...
...and I'm about to have the most organized sex anyone's ever had.
- Whatever happened to Ross? - I don't know.
Maybe he hooked up with that hot girl he talked to.
Come on, Chappy! Do your business! Make!
[CHAPPY WHIMPERING]
Make!
I did not sign on for this.
Hi!
- Hey! - Hi!
- How was the honeymoon? - Oh, incredible!
Champagne, candle-lit dinners,
moonlight walks on the beach.
It was so romantic.
- Where's Mike? - He's at the doctor.
He didn't poop while we were there.
I'm glad you're back. I need your help.
Oh, why, what's up?
I have an audition for this play,
and I have to speak French...
...which, according to my resume,
I'm fluent in.
Joey, you shouldn't lie on your resume.
Yeah, you really shouldn't.
By the way,
how was that yearlong dig in Cairo?
It was okay.
I did not know you spoke French.
You're so sexy.
Well, so will you help me?
I really wanna be in this play.
Sure.
Seriously, stop it.
I'm gonna jump on you.
Friends S10E13 The One Where Joey Speaks French
- Hey. - Hi.
Why are you wearing my apron?
I'm making cookies for Erica.
We have to leave soon.
Her plane comes in in about an hour.
When she gets here,
is it okay if I introduce you two as my wife...
...and the woman who's carrying my child?
No?
Divorce?
- Hey. - Hey.
You know where Rachel is?
No, we haven't haven't seen her since morning.
It's unbelievable.
She was supposed to meet me
a half-hour ago with Emma.
- Hey! - Hey!
These are for Erica!
She's gonna eat all those cookies?
Well, I want the baby to come out
all cute and fat!
So why is Erica coming to visit?
We wanna get to know her better.
And she's never been to New York,
so she wants to see the tourist spots:
Statue of Liberty, Empire State Building.
Oh, those places! There's always so many people,
and they're being corralled like cattle.
And, you know, there's always some idiot who goes, "Moo."
Well, if it annoys you so much,
then why do you do it?
Oh, hi. Hi. Thanks for showing up
30 minutes late.
Ross.
No, I'm sure you have a great excuse.
What was it, a hair appointment?
A mani-pedi?
Was there a sale at Barneys?{
My father had a heart attack.
While I was at Barneys.
- Oh, my God, Rach. - Honey?
- I'm so sorry. - Is he okay?
Yeah, he's gonna be fine,
but he's heavily sedated.
Okay, I'm gonna go to Long lsland with you.
I mean, you can't be alone right now.
No, come on, I'm totally okay.
I don't need you to come.
I can totally handle this on my own.
Still, still, let me come for me.
Okay. If you really need to.
I bet someone could use
one of Monica's freshly baked cookies.
Oh, I really could.
All right, it seems pretty simple.
Your first line is, "My name is Claude."
So just repeat after me.
- Well, let's try it again. - Okay.
It's not...
...quite what I'm saying.
Really? Sounds exactly the same to me.
- It does, really? - Yeah.
- Let's just try it again. - Okay.
- Really listen. - Got it.
- Hey, you guys! - Hi.
I want you to meet someone really special.
Phoebe, this is Erica. And this is the baby!
- Joey, Erica, baby. - Hi.
Everyone, Erica! Baby!
Monica. Calm. Self.
- Hey, sit down. - Thank you.
It's really nice to meet you guys.
I can't believe I'm here.
Well, welcome to New York City, or should I say:
Why would you say that?
Okay. What are you gonna be doing today?
Well, I wanna see everything!
Times Square, Coney lsland, Rockefeller Center.
Oh, you know what you should do?
You should walk to
the top of the Statue of Liberty.
- Oh, yeah, let's do that. - Great.
This baby better be really good.
Hi. Excuse me,
I'm here to see my father.
My name is Rachel Green.
And I'm Dr. Ross Geller.
Ross, please, this is a hospital.
That actually means something here.
- So can we please go in? - Absolutely.
Rach, I think I'm gonna wait out here...
...because my throat is feeling a little scratchy.
I don't wanna infect him.
Ross, please. Don't be so scared of him.
I am not scared of him. I'm really sick.
He's under sedation,
so he's pretty much out.
I'm feeling better.
Oh, my God.
That ear and nose hair trimmer I got him
was just money down the drain, huh?
Ms. Green?
Your father's doctor's on the phone
if you'd like to speak to him.
Oh, great. Are you gonna be okay?
He's unconscious. We'll be just fine.
Okay.
- Did the TV wake you? - No.
When you put your feet up on my bed,
you tugged on my catheter.
What are you doing here, Geller?
Well, I came with Rachel,
who should be back any second.
So, what's new?
Oh, I had a little heart attack.
Right. Is it painful?
What, the heart attack
or sitting here talking to you?
Let's see if we can get that Rachel back in here.
So, what's new with you?
Knocked up any more of my daughters lately?
Nope. Just the one. Rach!
No!
Okay, maybe if we just break it down.
Okay, let's try it one syllable at a time.
Okay, so repeat after me.
Great! Okay, faster.
Okay, it's too hard. I can't teach you.
What are you doing?
I have to go
before I put your head through a wall.
Don't go, I need you!
My audition is tomorrow!
Hey. I was gonna make us some dinner...
...but all I found in your dad's fridge
was bacon and heavy cream.
I think we solved
the mystery of the heart attack.
Did you call your parents?
Oh, yeah. Emma's doing great.
Oh, good.
- What? - I just can't believe...
...I'm in Rachel Green's room.
What do you mean?
You've been in my room before.
Yeah, sure, right.
Like I'd ever be in Rachel Green's room.
Okay, I gotta tell you,
it's really weird when you use my whole name.
Sorry.
- You okay? - Yeah.
- Yeah, you had a rough day. - Yeah.
It's just so weird seeing him like that, you know?
I mean, he's a doctor.
You don't expect doctors to get sick.
But we do.
He's gonna be okay, Rach.
I don't want him to wake up alone.
I should go to the hospital.
What? No, no. Hey, hey, look.
What?
They gave him a lot of medication.
He wouldn't even know if you were there.
We'll go see him first thing in the morning. Ok?
Really? I shouldn't feel guilty?
No-- God, hey.
Rach, you've been an amazing daughter, okay?
Right now you need to get some rest.
Okay, maybe you're right.
Good night.
Wait, wait, wait.
Would you stay here
with me for a little while?
- Sure. - Okay.
Thank you for coming with me today.
Oh, of course.
Rachel Green is very happy you're in her room.
Me too. Come here.
I just don't wanna be alone tonight.
Okay, well,
I can maybe grab a sleeping bag or--
No, Rach!
I'm sorry,
I just don't think this is a good idea.
Well, we won't know that until we do it,
will we?
No, look, uh.
You are upset about your father,
and you're feeling vulnerable...
...and I just don't feel it
would be right.
I feel like I'd be, you know,
taking advantage of you.
What--? Taking advantage?
I am giving you the advantage. Enjoy!
Look, I'm sure it would be great...
...but I think one of us has to be thinking clearly.
So I'm gonna go.
Okay.
I'll see you in the morning.
I haven't had sex in four months.
I should get a medal for that!
Thanks so much for taking me to all those places.
I had a great time.
I'm glad.
Listen, I wanna apologize about Chandler, though.
I just did not see this coming.
New York is awesome!
What is with you?
You know, I've been to these places before...
...but I've never really seen them.
Yeah, you miss a lot when you're mooing.
Thank you for showing me around.
Oh, it was our pleasure.
We're so much enjoying getting to know you.
Well, if there's anything else you wanna know....
Okay.
Can we ask you some questions
about the father?
Oh, sure. Yeah.
Well, he was my high-school boyfriend,
captain of the football team, really cute.
Got a scholarship and went to college.
That's great.
Yeah, it's almost definitely him.
How's that, now?
Well, there's a chance it's another guy.
I mean, I've only ever been with two guys...
...but they sort of overlapped.
So, what does the other guy do?
Does he go to college too?
No, he's in prison.
Was he falsely accused of something?
No.
He killed his father with a shovel.
Other than that, he's a great guy.
I'll bet his dad doesn't think so.
- Are you awake? - Of course I'm awake.
Assume from now on that I'm always awake.
All right, we don't know that it's him.
I mean, it could be the football guy.
Honey, it's us.
Of course it's the shovel killer.
Well, all right, let's say that it is him.
Would we not want the baby? No.
Would we treat him any differently?
I'd keep an eye on him.
We have to find out who the father is.
- How? - I don't know.
They have tests for these things, right?
Yes, but maybe we're just overreacting.
Easy for you to say.
He's a father killer.
He probably loves his mommy.
He's probably got a tattoo
that says "Mom" on his shovel-wielding arm.
We'll now count from one to five.
- Good job. - Thank you.
- Hey. - Hey, Joey.
Listen, I feel really badly about yesterday,
and I thought about it a lot.
No, I was too impatient.
So let's try it again.
That's okay. I don't need your help.
I worked on it myself,
and I gotta say I am pretty good.
Really, can I hear some of it?
Sure, sure.
Okay.
See?
You, you're not--
You're not-- You're--
Again, you're not speaking French!
Oh, well, I think I am.
Yeah, and I think I'm definitely gonna get the part.
How could you possibly think that?
For one thing.
The guy on the tape
said I was doing a good job!
Hey, Rach, can you grab me a cup of coffee?
Sure.
You've been quiet all morning.
Is everything okay?
- You sure you're all right? - Yep.
Okay.
Well, I'm gonna go grab us some breakfast.
FYI.
There it is.
In the future...
...when a girl asks for some ill-advised sympathy sex,
just do it.
Wait, wait, you're mad at me about last night?
I was just trying to do the right thing.
Really?
It seems to me.
If you had done the right thing...
...l wouldn't have woken up
feeling stupid and embarrassed.
I would've woken up feeling comforted and satisfied.
- Well-- - Oh, stop that!
I can't believe this. What you...
I was just being a good guy.
I treated you with respect and understanding.
Oh, that is so hot.
Hey, I was looking out for you.
Oh, really? Well, Ross,
you know what? I am a big girl.
I don't need someone telling me
what is best for me.
I gotta say, I've not had sex a lot of times before.
This is the worst ever!
Oh, really? Really?
Well, it wasn't very good for me either.
Okay, you know--?
Hey, hey, you know what?
To avoid this little thing in the future...
...let's just say you and me?
Never having sex again.
What?
That's right! Sex is off the table!
I am never having sex with you again!
Dr. Green, are you feeling better?
Hey. How was lunch?
We had a good time.
By the way,
I wanted to ask you something.
It would really mean a lot to me if the baby was a boy...
...that you name him after my father...
...Jiminy Billy Bob.
- Oh, really? - No!
You were right. That was fun.
I'm gonna go finish packing.
So is she gonna take the test?
No, she doesn't have to.
I found out who the father is.
Oh, God.
It's Shovely Joe, isn't it?
No, it's not.
How do you know?
Erica didn't pay attention in sex ed class...
...because the things
she did with that prison guy?
It'd be pretty hard to make a baby that way.
Oh, God, what was it?
The thing we hardly ever do,
or the thing we never do?
The thing we never do.
Shovely Joe.
Whenever you're ready, Joey.
Right.
I'm sorry, what's going on?
Dude, come on, French it up.
Joey, do you speak French?
You know what? I think this audition is over.
Excuse me?
I am Regine Phalange.
I was passing by
when I heard this man speaking...
...the regional dialect of my French town of Estee Lauder.
You really think this man is speaking French?
Good job, little buddy.
That was some really good French.
But I think we're gonna go with
someone else for the part.
All right, but my French was good?
It was great.
See?
Emma's down for the night.
Oh, good.
- So I guess I'm gonna take off. - Okay.
Hey, listen, just before you go--
I just wanna say thank you
for coming with me.
Oh, no problem.
And also, you know, l--
I was thinking about what you said,
you know, about the whole sex thing....
Probably not a great idea to go down that road again.
Thank you. I'm glad you agree.
It's a shame, though.
When we did it, it was pretty good.
Yeah.
Yeah, that's true.
Hey, do you remember that one really great time?
- Oh, yeah! - You know?
It was Valentine's Day.
It was your birthday.
- Oh, yeah. - Oh, yeah.
Well, I guess that's all in the past now.
- Not even one more time. - Not even once.
No matter how much we want it.
Even if we want it...
...really bad.
That's what we decided.
Right.
It's kind of hard, though. You know?
Yeah.
You know. When two people have a connection,
you know, that's--
Just seems like...
...such a...
...waste.
I hate waste.
- Ross? - Yes?
Just so you know...
...with us...
...it's never off the table.
Damn it, it's never off the table.
Okay, can you really tap-dance?
No.
It's off the resume.
- Archery? - No.
- Horseback riding? - Would fall off a lot.
You can drink a gallon of milk in 10 seconds?
That I can do.
Come on,
you can drink a gallon of milk in 10 seconds?
All right, watch me.
Okay, you time me, ready?
Ready, go!
You did it!
Thank you guys for having us over.
Yeah, this is fun, couples night.
I don't know why we don't hang out...
...with married couples more often.
Because every time we do...
...you make jokes about swinging
and scare them away.
You mean that Portuguese couple?
Yeah, like you wouldn't have done it.
Hey, you guys, I have great news.
We're kind of in the middle of dinner.
Oh, well, I already ate, but sure.
Guess what happened at work today.
A dinosaur died a million years ago?
Try 65 million years ago. And then try...
My tenure review board met today,
and I hear it's looking really good.
Yeah, do you have any idea
what this means in academic circles?
I am gonna get laid.
- Hi, you guys. - Hey.
Oh, ltalian.
No one-- No one wanted seconds, right?
No, I'm good.
Guys, you're never gonna believe it.
This headhunter called me.
I have a meeting tomorrow with Gucci.
Gucci wants me.
- I'm up for tenure. - Congratulations.
You too. What are the odds?
Guess what?
I finally got that seed out of my teeth.
I don't know who I'm happiest for.
I do. He's been working on that all day.
Friends S10E14 The One With Princess Consuela
Hey, Mon, was it weird
changing your name to Geller Bing?
No. No, it felt nice to acknowledge this.
- Where'd you go to do it? - The--
The Ministry of Names...
...Bureau.
You never did it.
I'm sorry. It's just the idea of--
Of being an official Bing.
Hey, I will have you know that--
Who am I kidding? Let's call the kid Geller
and let Bing die with me.
- Here you go. - Thanks.
Honey, would you want me to take your name?
Oh, it's up to you.
It's your name.
You've gotta live with it.
Let's see. Call me Mrs. Hannigan.
Mrs. Hannigan?
What? Can't you see I'm in the middle of something?
I like it.
- Hey, guys. - Hey, Joe.
We've got a couple of things
we've got to check out at the new house.
You want to come?
No, thank you.
You're not happy about us moving...
...but you're the only one who hasn't seen the house.
Yeah, come with us.
You'll see how close it is.
No, it's not close.
You said it was in escrow.
I couldn't even find that on the map.
Joey, please come.
It would mean so much to us.
You know what?
You are my friends.
I want to be supportive.
I will come with you. Shotgun.
Damn it.
See you guys later.
We'll pick you up at 11.
So glad you're coming.
All right.
Good for you.
That was really mature.
What? No, the only reason I'm going...
...to their stupid house is
to point out everything wrong with it...
...so they don't move.
I'm gonna make them stay here.
You're a strange kind of grownup.
Joey, you can't make someone do something
they don't want to do.
Believe me.
There's something I've been trying to
get Mike to do in bed, and--
Can we not talk about that now?
All right. Prude.
Look, Monica and Chandler
really love this house.
You are not gonna talk them into staying here.
Hey, I can convince people to do anything, you know?
I bet I could even get Mike to do that thing.
What is it?
I am not gonna help you do that!
Oh, my God.
Hi. I'm here to see Mr. Campbell, with Gucci.
The reservation's probably under Gucci.
It's spelled like "Gukki"
which can be confusing.
Mr.Campbell's not here yet.
Let me show you to his table.
Oh, my God. That's my boss.
You have to seat us somewhere else.
I'm sorry,
that's always Mr.Campbell's table.
But my boss cannot see me.
I'm interviewing for another job.
I know. With "Gukki."
- Rachel? - I'm on a date.
That's great.
Yeah, it is.
Yeah, you know, it's tough.
Single mom. Career.
You gotta get out there.
Well, you've got a good energy.
- Rachel? - Yes, hi.
- James Campbell. - Hi.
- Excuse us. - Please.
He's cute.
So...
...your resume is quite impressive.
My resume?
I wouldn't-- I wouldn't call
my online dating profile a resume.
Dating profile?
No, I'm-- I'm talking about the work resume.
Whatever happened to
just singing for no reason?
Maybe people found it weird.
So....
Why do you want to leave Ralph Lauren?
What?
- I...I don't. - You don't?
No, I love-- I love it there.
Well, if you don't want to leave,
why are we having this lunch?
What?
That's Hugo Boss?
This place is so depressing.
If I had to work here,
I'd kill myself.
But you obviously haven't.
How can I help you?
I need to change my name, please.
See, I need to change it because I'm hiding from the law.
You're fun.
You need to fill out this form.
Okay. Well, just so I know--
I don't know how it works. My name is Buffay...
...and my husband's name is Hannigan.
So is it supposed to be "Buffay-Hannigan"
or "Hannigan-Buffay"?
It can be anything you want.
Well, not anything.
Yeah. Anything.
Oh, this could take a while.
- Get out of my line. - Okay.
- Hey. - Hey, Pheebs.
Oh, not anymore. I changed it today.
Oh, I'm sorry, Mrs. Hannigan.
Wrong again.
Apparently, you can change it to anything.
So I thought, "All right,
here's an opportunity to be creative."
So meet Princess Consuela Banana Hammock.
That's what we were gonna name the baby.
- Phoebe. - Princess Consuela.
You seriously changed your name to that?
Okay, so from now on,
we have to call you Princess Consuela?
No, I'm gonna have my friends call me Valerie.
- Hey, how did the interview go? - Not good.
You know. I always feel that way after an interview.
I'll bet it went better than you think.
Well, I didn't get the job at Gucci
and I got fired from Ralph Lauren.
That is a bad interview.
What are you talking about?
How did this happen?
My boss was at the same restaurant
where I was having my interview...
...and he heard everything.
Later, he calls me into his office
and tells me he'll have to let me go...
...because I'm not a team player.
And I said, "Wait a minute. Yes, I am."
And then I had to sit there for 45 minutes...
...while he proved that that, in fact, was true.
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.
Hey.
What--? What's this?
Why, it's a bottle of champagne.
Why is this here?
- Ross. - I guess it's here...
...because I got tenure!
- Congratulations. - Congratulations.
This is the single greatest day of my professional career.
- Gunther. Six glasses. - Six?
You want me to join you?
I thought Joey was here.
Five is good.
Wow, I'm gonna have a loogey in my coffee tomorrow.
Israeli champagne.
And it's vanilla.
I got tenure. I didn't win the lottery.
Hey, Rach, so how did your thing go?
Good.
But I'm not going to hear about that for a couple days.
Oh, you know what, you're gonna get it.
I can feel it.
Can you?
All right, everybody, here's to Ross.
And to years of hard work finally paying off.
And to knowing that your career
doesn't mean everything.
But also knowing it means a lot.
But more importantly, to full, well-rounded lives.
That center around work.
- To Ross. - To Ross.
You know what the best part about this is?
I can never be fired.
- Oh, God. - No, seriously.
I have job security for life.
You know? I mean, I never have to worry.
Oh, look at you. Look how happy you are for me.
No, it's not that. I got fired today.
And I didn't get the other job.
Rach, I'm so sorry.
Great, I feel like an idiot.
No, it's okay. You didn't know.
Little heads-up would've been nice.
Thank you for letting us see the house again.
And thank you for explaining to us what escrow means.
I've already forgotten what you said,
but thank you.
Take as long as you want.
Just let me know when you're through.
So glad you decided to come.
Me too. Yeah, this place is great.
So happy for you guys.
Although, you know, I hope you like fungus.
- What? - Fungus.
Yeah. Place is full of it.
No, it's not.
We had an inspection
and they didn't find anything.
Okay. Then I guess I have dry eyes
and a scratchy throat for no reason.
Maybe it's because you hung your head
out the window like a dog...
...the whole ride here.
Maybe.
So this is the living room, huh?
It's pretty dark.
No, it's not.
Are you kidding?
I think I just saw a bat in the corner.
When your head was hanging out the window,
it didn't hit a mailbox, did it?
Maybe.
Look, I just think you guys can do
better than this house, you know?
Or any other house for that matter.
Oh, Joey.
We know you're having a hard time with this, but we--
We love it here.
Fine! Ok. If you love this house so much...
...you should live here. Okay?
I hope you get used to that weird humming sound.
- Joey, we know that's you. - No...
...it's not.
- Welcome back. - I missed you.
- Oh, me too. - So, what's new?
Well, I am no longer Phoebe Buffay.
That's great. You changed your name?
Yes, I did.
Meet Princess Consuela Banana Hammock.
- You're kidding, right? - Nope.
- You really did that? - Yep.
You can't do that.
Why?
Why? It's fun.
It's different. No one else has a name like it.
Then I'm gonna change my name.
Great. Okay, what are you gonna change it to?
Crap Bag.
Mike Crap Bag?
No. No "Mike." No, just "Crap Bag."
First name: Crap. Last name: Bag.
You're not serious, right?
Yeah, I'm serious.
It's fun, it's different,
and no one else has a name like that.
Well, then great.
If you love it, I love it.
I do love it. And I love your name.
I love Princess Consuela.
And I love Crap.
- Who are you? - Oh, hi. I'm Joey.
My stupid friends are buying this house.
Who are you?
I'm Mackenzie.
My stupid parents are selling this house.
I hate my parents.
I hate my friends.
Look, there's gotta be a way
that we can stop this from happening.
Like what?
Okay, you come with me and you tell them that the house is haunted.
What are you, 8?
Okay. Let's hear your great idea.
I don't have any great ideas.
I am 8.
There's gotta be a way. I mean, you know...
...if Monica and Chandler move here,
and Phoebe's married to Mike...
...that just leaves me and Ross and Rach.
You know what I mean?
I really don't.
What am I gonna do?
I feel like I'm losing my friends.
My parents say I'll make new friends.
Yeah, sure, easy for you.
You're young. Me? I'm set in my ways.
This is what my mom was talking about.
Whiners are wieners.
Look, you want your friends to be happy, right?
Yeah. Yeah, I guess. Yeah.
Well, if moving here is gonna make them happy,
don't you want them to do it?
Yeah. Maybe.
Then you've gotta let them go.
Oh, I hate to admit it, but you're--
You're probably right.
How'd you get to be so smart?
I read a lot.
Just when I thought we could be friends.
Oh, hey, Rach. I just heard. I'm so sorry.
Oh, thank you....
You still don't know my name, do you?
Well, now I don't have to.
Ross, what is taking you so long?
I'm sorry. It's almost as if
this wasn't built for a quick getaway.
Rachel?
Mark? Oh, my God.
How have you been?
Fantastic. You remember Ross.
Sure.
What's with the chair?
You know, you can't always
get a seat on the subway, so....
Clever.
So how are you?
You're not catching me on my best day.
Yeah, a box full of your desk stuff doesn't say "big promotion."
No, but it's good.
You know, I'm gonna take some time off...
- ...and do charity work. - Are you sure?
We may have something at Louis Vuitton.
Screw charity work. What do you got?
Why don't we have dinner and talk?
- Great. I'll call you. - Okay.
Nice to see you again.
Yeah. Yeah. I got tenure.
Oh, my God.
See? I told you something good would come along.
And he seemed really nice.
I've met him before?
Ross, that's Mark.
From Bloomingdale's?
You were insanely jealous of him.
- That is Mark? - Yes.
I hate that guy.
No, no, no.
You cannot go to dinner with him.
What? You don't want me to get a job?
Yeah, I'm sure he'll give you a job.
Maybe make you his "sex-cretary."
I'm serious. I just don't trust that guy, okay?
Ross. You know what--?
Okay, let's talk about it later. There comes security.
Oh, I love this street.
The trees and the big front yards and the actual picket fences.
Man, those two dogs are going at it.
Hey. Where you been?
Oh, just, you know, looking around.
But you know what?
This house is great.
Really? What changed your mind?
The little girl who lives here made me feel better about the whole thing.
Joey? There was a little girl who lived here,
but she died, like, 30 years ago.
What?
I'm just messing with you.
That's not funny.
You know I'm afraid of little-girl ghosts.
Now that you're okay with the house,
do you want to go see your room?
What?
I get my own room?
You don't think we'd buy a house
and not have a Joey room, do you?
Oh, my God.
Hey, can I have an aquarium?
And a sex swing?
No.
Why not? I'll keep the tank clean.
After you, Ms. Bananahammock.
Thank you, Mr. Bag.
- Oh, hi, Rita. - How are you?
Good. Oh, Rita's a massage client.
Yeah.
Why don't you introduce me?
Rita, this is my husband.
Why don't you tell her my name?
Okay, I will. This is-- This is my husband, Crap Bag.
Crap Bag?
If you need an easy way to remember it,
just think of a bag of crap.
- Okay. Excuse me. - Yeah.
Okay, fine, you made your point.
Can you please just be Mike Hannigan again?
Only if you'll be Phoebe Buffay.
How about--? How about Buffay-Hannigan?
Really?
Yeah.
I'm Phoebe Buffay-Hannigan-Banana Hammock.
Do you even know what a banana hammock is?
It's a funny word.
It's a Speedo.
Oh, crap.
- Hey, is Rachel here? - Nope.
She's still at dinner?
I guess. Why, who's she with?
That guy, Mark...
...from Bloomingdale's.
She thinks he's just being nice to her.
But I know he really wants to sleep with her.
It's seven years ago.
My time machine works.
We ran into him on the street today,
and he said he might have a job for her.
But I know he just wants to get into her pants.
So, what if he wants to sleep with her?
I mean, she's single, and he's cute.
Excuse me?
Oh, please.
Yesterday, on the subway, you couldn't stop staring...
...at that woman with the big breasts the whole time.
For your information, I was staring at her baby.
We're about to be parents.
Oh, sorry.
- Hi, you guys. - Hi. So...
...how was dinner?
Oh, it was great. Mark is so sweet.
Oh, yeah? Yeah, I wonder why?
What could that smarmy letch possibly want?
Oh, Ross. Come on. He is happily married.
His wife just had twins.
Should we send something?
How did the job stuff go?
He offered me one.
- That's great. - Congratulations.
I know, it's amazing.
It's amazing. It's so much better
than what I had at Ralph Lauren.
- The money is great. - Can we--?
Can we just stop for a second?
Who said something better would come along?
You didn't believe me.
I told you everything was gonna work out.
You know what?
This calls for a bottle of lsrael's finest.
The job is in Paris.
I mean, this soap opera is a great gig...
...but am I missing opportunities?
You know, I've always thought of myself as a serious actor.
Should I be trying to do more independent movies?
I don't know.
But you know what?
I'm gonna put you on with my bear.
Hold on.
Hey, Bailey, I need some career advice.
Previously on Friends:
How did the job stuff go?
He offered me one!
You know what?
This calls for a bottle of lsrael's finest!
The job is in Paris.
Oh, God, please, somebody say something.
So if you take this job,
you'll be moving to Paris?
Or facing a bitch of a commute.
I know, it's huge,
and it's scary
and it's really far away from you guys.
But this is such an incredible opportunity for me.
I've already told them about our situation with Emma...
...and they said they'll do whatever we need to make us feel comfortable.
I mean, I'll fly back and forth,
they'll fly you out.
Anything we want.
My boss said I might be getting a new lamp
in my cubicle.
All right. We'll work it out.
Oh, thank you. Thank you.
You sure this is what you want?
I think it is.
What's going on?
I got a really incredible job offer.
- Hey, great! All right! - Good for you!
- It's in Paris. - What?
No...
No, too much is changing, okay?
First Phoebe getting married.
Congratulations.
And then these two move in to
a stupid house in the stupid suburbs.
Earlier, you said you'd be supportive.
It comes and goes. I wouldn't trust it!
You guys, this is really,
really important to me.
It means a lot
if you could try to get onboard.
Of course we can. Congratulations.
Thank you.
Joey?
No, my hugs are reserved for people staying in America!
Joey, it would mean--
No! Get your France-going arms away from me!
Are you okay with this?
Well, it makes me feel sad, but--
Talking to Ross.
I see.
Rachel moving to another country?
Not being able to see her every day?
How could I be okay with this?
But what are we gonna do?
She really needs this job.
Do you think if Ralph Lauren offered her her old job back,
she would take it?
How's that gonna happen?
Is this the best way to use one of your three magic wishes?
Like, I don't know,
I could talk to her boss. Yeah.
I met him at that Christmas party.
I mean, we really hit it off.
The guy who kept calling you "Ron"?
I didn't say we were brothers!
Friends S10E15 The One Where Estelle Dies
Hey, Phoebe. Hey.
Hi.
The house next door to the one
that we're buying just went on the market.
I wanna take a look at it,
but Chandler doesn't.
We close escrow tomorrow.
Seeing another house can only confuse us.
We're easily confused.
We're not very bright.
But what if it's better than ours?
Shouldn't we look?
What do you think, Pheebs?
Well, I think that shirt makes you look like
you should work at a Baskin-Robbins.
Anyway....
Hey, isn't Joey's agent Estelle Leonard?
Yeah.
- She died. - You're kidding!
- That's terrible. - Yeah, last Saturday.
Wow! She was the first black man
to fly solo across the Atlantic!
Wait a minute, I read the wrong one.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah, she was just an agent.
Joey's gonna be so upset.
I know. He always wanted to be
the first black man to cross the Atlantic.
We cannot tell Joey about this.
He's already flipping out
about everything changing.
This'll push him over the edge.
You don't think we should tell him?
Not for a while.
Let's just give him a few days
to get used to everything else.
What if he reads the paper?
Unless Snoopy says it to Charlie Brown,
I think we're okay.
May I help you?
Yeah. I'm a friend of Rachel Green's.
Actually, we met at the Christmas party about two years ago.
- Oh, right. Don? - Close. Ron.
Well, what can I do for you?
Well, I'm here to see
if you'll give Rachel her job back.
Did she ask you to come here and do this?
First I have to get you to agree...
...then we'll see if she wants to come back.
Wow, that is tempting.
She loved her job here.
Let's face it, you're not gonna find anyone...
...who did it as well as she did. Isn't that true?
- She is good. - I took a shot there.
But I'm sorry, there's nothing I can do.
Oh, that's not true. There's nothing I want to do.
I see.
Thanks very much.
- Is this your son? - Yeah, his name is Ross.
What?
Nothing, it's just that it's close to Ron.
Does little Ross like dinosaurs, by any chance?
Yeah, they're all he talks about. Why?
How would he like to
come with me to the Museum of Natural History...
...after everyone else has left,
just the two of us...
...and he can touch anything he wants?
I just heard it how you must have heard it, and that's not good.
Let me start again. I'm a paleontologist.
You'll be there with us, and the touching refers only to bones-- fossils!
You could really arrange that?
You let Rachel come back and it's done.
I guess having Rachel back wouldn't be the worst thing in the world.
Yes! Thank you! This is great! Thank you so much.
I swear, your kid's gonna have the time of his life.
That's great. I worry about little Ross.
He's always reading,
collecting rocks and he's obsessed with dinosaurs.
He'll be fine!
- Hey, Pheebs. - Hey.
Everything okay?
I'm just mad at my agent.
Estelle? Why?
There's a part in this TV movie that I would be perfect for...
...and I didn't even get put up for it. She better have a good reason.
I'm guessing she does.
Well, I wanna hear it, because she keeps doing this.
No, wait, wait, wait! All right, I gotta go.
Just listen. Promise me that you will wait a minute before you call her.
Well, okay. Why?
Because a promise between friends means never having to give a reason.
I love that saying!
- Hello? - Joey, it's Estelle.
I was just gonna call you. That's weird.
It's a little coincidental, but believable.
Listen, I'm sure you're wondering
why I didn't get you...
...an audition for that TV movie.
Yeah, actually I am.
I guess I dropped the ball there.
That's it?
You know, it seems like all you do lately is drop the ball.
Don't take that tone with me.
Who do you think you are?
Alan Lemon,
the first black man to fly solo across the Atlantic?
No, look, all I'm saying is you're my agent...
...and you're not getting me any auditions
and I'm tired of it.
What are you saying?
I'm saying that this isn't working for me anymore, okay, Estelle?
You're fired. Goodbye.
Man, tough week for Estelle.
- Hi. - Hi.
Emma left her stuffed T. Rex at my house.
You know she can't sleep without it.
Well, she's asleep now.
Stop forcing that thing on her.
Okay.
You're not gonna believe what happened to me today!
Ralph Lauren called and gave me my job back!
- No! - I mean, it was the weirdest thing.
They fire me and then out of nowhere, they just hire me back.
I mean, that place must just be falling apart without me!
So you're not going to Paris?
No, I'm still going!
What?
Well, when the Louis Vuitton people found out...
...that Ralph Lauren wanted me back,
they offered me more money!
Ross, isn't that great?
Hi. We're buying the house next door.
Could we just take a look around?
Sure,
I'm showing it to someone else right now,
but please, look around.
I feel like we're cheating on our house.
If we cheat, shouldn't it
be with a hot, younger house...
...that does stuff that our house won't do?
Ours is so much better!
This living room is smaller,
the dining room looks like a cave.
What a hole!
- So, what do you think? - Love it!
We already have one offer.
I think the lady upstairs will make another one.
They could be our neighbors. What are they like?
The woman upstairs is nice.
She and her husband have two kids.
He's on Wall Street, and she's a--
Oh... my... God!
Sure.
Hey, Joey, you wanna come with me to--?
Are you okay?
Yeah, I just feel bad about firing Estelle.
This has gotta be killing her.
No, that wouldn't kill her.
A coronary embolism might.
I don't know. She's gotta be taking it hard. I was her only client.
Except for this guy who eats paper.
And I'm guessing he eats more money than he makes.
Look, I know she's not a great agent,
but she did stick with me for 10 years.
I'm gonna call her and hire her again.
No, no, no! Don't call her.
- You wait for her to call you. - Why?
Because patience is the road to understanding.
Which is the key to a happy heart.
You blow me away.
All right, so promise you're gonna wait for her to call you?
- I promise. - Okay.
And that means never having to give a reason.
What a small world!
And yet I never run into Beyonce.
You two know each other?
We go way back.
Before Monica made an honest man out of him...
...Chandler used to be my little love muffin.
So are you guys thinking of getting this house too?
Are we gonna have a bidding war?
I better warn you, I'm a toughie.
Don't...
Don't do that.
No, actually, we are buying the house next door.
Why?
I don't know why.
Oh, that decides it, then! I was on the fence.
But knowing that you two would be our neighbors?
Now we have to get it!
Ellen, we're gonna talk numbers.
This cannot be happening.
The realtor said another couple made an offer.
Maybe the Janices won't get it!
Maybe the other couple will.
The only way that'll happen is
if the other couple are the Hitlers!
Okay, okay! All right, what if we get both houses?
We can turn this one into a guesthouse!
That's a great idea!
By the way, I don't mean to sound distasteful...
...but when did you start crapping money?
- You come up with an idea. - All right.
We've still got three hours till escrow closes on our house.
We can still get out.
But we love our house.
Will we love it so much with her next door?
And she's gonna be louder out here too!
Just the crickets and, "Oh... my... God!"
Okay. But if we don't get this house,
she'll still show up wherever we go.
At least if she's here,
it eliminates the element of surprise.
Never again will you have to hear the three words...
...that make your balls jump back up inside your body!
Well, we have to do something.
We can't have her living next door.
Oh, that does it too.
Who is it?
It's me. Ron.
Look, I know Rachel turned you down...
...but I think there's a way you might be able to get her to come back.
This may surprise you,
but rehiring fired employees is not my main job.
Just hear me out.
How would you feel about offering her a raise?
Not good, Ron.
Perhaps I can persuade you.
What if you could give your son...
...this genuine pterodactyl egg replica.
Wow! That's pretty cool.
So? Do we have a deal?
- Okay, you got it. - Yes! Yes!
This is gonna make me very popular.
Believe me, the ladies, they love it.
I meant with my son.
Good, because the ladies, not so much.
Joey, this is Al Zebooker, the guy who eats paper.
I'm sure you've heard that Estelle passed away.
I wanted to let you know there's a memorial for her...
...at the Westside Chapel tomorrow at 1O.
Hope you can make it.
Oh, my God.
- Hello? - Joey, it's Estelle.
Estelle?
Yeah, I wanted to call and tell you
that there's no hard feelings for firing me.
Okay. I just-- I can't believe you're calling me.
I didn't think I should just drop by.
No, no! Don't drop by! Don't drop by!
Anyway, you did what you had to do. I'm okay.
Can I ask you something?
What's it like there?
It's all right.
Look, kiddo, I gotta go.
Good luck with the career. You're gonna be huge!
Thanks for everything, Estelle. Bye.
"Out of area." Boy, I'll say!
Well, I just talked to Sid.
We are definitely putting in an offer on the house.
And I'll bet we get it!
The Hitlers will be so disappointed.
All right, I gotta run. Tell Monica I say goodbye.
I'll see you later, neighbor.
Wait!
I just want you to know that I'm so happy you're going to be here.
Oh, me too!
Because...
...that way...
...we can pick up where we left off.
I never stopped loving you.
- Oh... my-- - Yeah...
I want you.
I need you.
I must have you,
Janice Litman-Goralnik ne Hosenstein.
Chandler, what are you talking about?
Now that you live next door, we can be together every day.
Sid and Monica never have to know a thing.
I don't know what to say.
I mean, you know, obviously we have this heat between us.
Obviously.
But I love my husband.
And I know you love your wife.
I don't think we should get this house now.
Don't say that. Don't dangle the dream and take it away.
Chandler, one of us has got to be strong.
I understand.
Although....
Maybe just one last moment of weakness.
Goodbye, Chandler Bing.
They're never coming down now!
- Hi. - Hi!
You are never going to believe what happened to me today.
What?
Ralph Lauren called, again,
and they offered me more money.
- They did? - Yes! It was the weirdest thing.
Zelner called me and said, "We will do anything we can to get you back."
And that I should thank some "Ron."
I don't even know what department that guy's in!
- So, what are you gonna do? - Well, I took it!
That's great! So you're staying in New York!
You're excited, right?
You know, the money's great.
- It's certainly the easier choice. - Right.
But, you know, I mean, was I looking forward to going to Paris? Sure.
Was I excited about working in the fashion capital of the world?
Oh, absolutely.
Yeah, but you know, this is....
It's fine. I'm fine going back to a job where I've pretty much...
...gotten everything out of it that I possibly can.
I had no idea--
I had no idea you were so excited about Paris.
I mean, you said you were scared.
I mean, it was "good" scared, though, you know?
I mean, like "when I moved to New York" scared.
Or "when I found out I was gonna have Emma" scared.
But this is fine. This is gonna be good.
You should go.
What?
It's what you want. You should go.
You really think so?
I really do.
But I already told Zelner that I would come back.
I'm sure he'll understand.
All right. All right! I'm gonna do it! I'm gonna go to Paris!
- Yeah. - Yeah.
I'm going to Paris!
- Thank you, Ross. - Yeah, yeah.
Oh, I'm so happy.
Then I'm happy too.
Thank you all for coming.
We're here today to pay our respects to a wonderful agent...
...and a beautiful woman.
Inside.
As Estelle's only two clients,
we would like to say a few words.
Dude, where's my speech?
That is entertaining.
Al Zebooker, everybody!
All right, let's play one more time, okay?
And remember, if I win,
you do not move to Paris.
Okay.
I can't believe I'm risking this again,
but you're on.
All right, Joe, you remember the rules.
Heads, I win. Tails, you lose.
Just flip.
- Tails! - Damn it!
So we thought we'd throw you a little
going-away party around 7.
Oh, that sounds good.
Hey, Rach, you're leaving tomorrow.
Shouldn't you be packing?
- It's all done. - Oh, yeah, right.
And after I took a shower this morning,
I just threw my towel on the floor.
Oh, God, it hurts to even joke about it.
I know.
Honey, seriously, I did it all.
The luggage that I'm taking is in the bedroom.
This is Emma's Paris stuff.
These are the boxes that I'm having shipped...
...and that's the sandwich I made for the plane.
Okay, so you've done some good work.
Yeah.
What about your carryons?
Oh, well, everything that I need is in here...
...and my travel documents are on the counter...
...organized in the order that I will be needing them.
Oh, my God. I have nothing left to teach you.
Where's your passport?
It should be next to my plane ticket.
Well, it's not.
What? Well, maybe I put it in here?
Oh, it's not in there!
Oh, no,
I must have packed it in one of these boxes!
- Here, let me help you. - Shoot.
I can't believe i did this.
At what point did
it stop being funny that I took her passport?
Friends S10E16 The One With Rachel's Going Away Party
Oh, wow, can you believe you're only three weeks away?
I know.
You don't mind me touching your belly?
No. I don't mind you touching my belly...
...but your hand's kind of blocking the part
where the baby's gonna come out.
- Hey! - Hey.
Hi, Erica. Welcome back to town.
Wow, look how big you've gotten.
That's because I'm pregnant.
- Right. No, I understand. - Oh, okay.
I'm just always afraid
that people think I'm just fat with big breasts.
No, no, I knew.
Okay, well, stop staring at them.
She brought them up.
I didn't realize you were coming back so soon.
In a couple weeks I won't be able to travel.
And I wanted her to get to know the doctors
and get settled into the hotel.
Why isn't she staying with you guys?
Because we're moving in a couple days
and it just didn't make sense.
Plus, hotels are fun!
My room has this little fridge
full of free snacks.
Erica, those things aren't free.
They have one of the highest markups of any consumer product--
Ross, she's giving us her baby.
She can eat you if she wants.
I'll be right back.
Oh, man, I can't believe you guys are leaving this place.
I know...
You know, you could take it if you want.
The lease is still in Nana's name.
No, no. This will always be your place.
It would be too sad.
Plus, how much a month does it cost to feed Joey?
Yeah, it takes two incomes.
Is Chandler here?
We talked about catching a movie.
Oh, no, he doesn't have time for that.
You can go help him
and Joey pack up the guest room.
Packing. Sexy cheerleader comedy.
Helpful brother.
Creepy loner at teen movie.
What are you guys doing?
Try it. I can't feel a thing.
Are you kidding?
This is packing?
We're taking a break.
From?
Jumping on the bed.
All right, Rachel's party is in a couple of hours,
and there's a lot to do.
Ross, you've got Geller blood.
You're in charge of these yahoos.
- You got it. - All right.
All right, she's right. We gotta get serious.
Let's put Styrofoam peanuts down his pants
and kick him!
No, guys, she's right. We should get to work.
I'll take stuff out of the closet.
Joey, you pack them,
and Ross, you repack whatever Joey packs.
You guys hear a ringing?
What the hell is this?
Hey, handcuffs. And fur-lined. Nice.
I didn't know you guys had it in you.
Chandler, you don't have a sister,
so you can't understand...
...how much this bums me out.
I didn't know Monica had these.
Maybe she used them with another boyfriend.
Maybe Richard.
Why would she use them with Richard and not me?
I can be kinky.
I once did a naked dance
for her with scarves.
Bumming hard, guys. Bumming hard.
- Hey. - Hey. Where's Mike?
Oh, he has a gig.
It's kind of like being married
to a rock star, you know?
My husband has a gig.
Yeah? Where is it?
Oh, he's playing organ
for a children's roller-skating party.
Rock on!
Wow, this is quite a spread.
What is all this stuff?
I thought this would be a great opportunity to use up all the food...
...that I don't want to move to the new house with me.
So enjoy.
Smoked oyster casserole with a breakfast-cereal crust.
Kidney beans in their own juices,
and for dessert, a questionable orange.
Where's Rach?
She's putting Emma down.
She'll be over in a second.
It just hit her that she's leaving.
She's kind of emotional,
so no one say anything to set her off, okay?
- Hey, Rach. - Hey.
There she is.
Hi, you guys.
What did I just say?
Oh, no, no, no, it's okay. It's okay. I'm gonna be fine.
- Come here, I'll make you a drink. - Okay.
Oh, man, I can't believe she's actually leaving.
How am I gonna say goodbye to Rachel?
I know, she's been such a big part of my life.
It feels like when Melrose Place got cancelled.
I mean....
Forget it, I miss Melrose Place.
- I had a chance to stop her too. - Yeah?
Who loses 57 coin tosses in a row? You know?
Heads, she wins. Tails, I lose.
Wait a minute.
Yes, Joe?
I forgot to pick up my dry cleaning.
So you doing okay?
Well, I've been better.
You guys are gonna come visit, right?
Yes! You know,
in six months, the statute of limitations runs out...
...and I can travel internationally again.
- I'm gonna miss you so much. - I know.
You know what?
I have some goodbye stuff that I wanted to say...
...to each of you. I was gonna save it till the end of the night,
but come here.
Hey, what do you think they're doing in there?
If I had to guess, I'd say...
...Rachel's putting on the bubble wrap,
and Phoebe's doing the punching.
Pheebs, I don't even know where to start.
Okay, well, before you do,
I know we weren't supposed to get you presents...
...but I do have something for you.
What is it?
Well, it's a cotton swab...
...with a bit of my saliva on it...
...so that if they perfect the cloning process
while you're over there...
...you can use the DNA
to create your own Pheebs.
I'm gonna throw this away...
...but thank you so much for the gesture.
Chandler?
I was just in our bedroom, and I found these on my pillow.
Oh, yes, I decided to leave those out for you
in case Richard stops by...
...and you want to engage in a little light bondage and mustache play.
What? These aren't mine.
Oh, yeah, right!
Good luck getting another scarf dance from me.
That would be a terrible punishment.
But I'm serious,
I've never seen these before.
Really?
Then what are they doing in our guest room?
Rachel used to live in that room.
Rachel. With handcuffs.
Interesting.
Joey's bare ass.
Well played.
- I love you, Phoebe. - I love you too.
Please....
Please don't--
Don't turn into, you know, a French bitch.
I won't.
All right. Well, if I'm gonna do this,
I better keep going.
- Okay. - Okay.
- Monica? - Yeah?
- Will you come with me for a minute? - Sure.
- Are you wearing waterproof mascara? - No.
Oh, you're so screwed.
Hey.
What was that all about?
She's gonna say goodbye
to each of us individually.
Are you kidding? Oh, my God.
Yeah, I know.
It's gonna be even worse for you. God.
Well, just get ready to do some serious crying.
Man, I'm not gonna be able to handle this.
Now I know how my students feel
at the end of each year.
And why they act out
by giving me such bad evaluations.
Mon. Okay.
I better just say what it is I'm gonna say.
None of the amazing things
that have happened to me in the last 10 years...
...would have happened if it wasn't for you.
No one has been more like a sister to me.
I know what you mean.
You're like a sister to me too.
I don't know what I'm going to do without you.
You're the greatest friend I ever had.
--Seeing you every day.
What?
I--
--see you every day!
That is so sweet!
Oh, no, she took down Monica.
And I'm the crier in the family.
Oh, God, I could be next.
Maybe she won't talk to me
if it looks like we're deep in conversation.
Oh, so that thing you said about the thing...
...it really made me think about that other thing.
Rach?
Oh, it's okay, Chandler's talking to her.
I really made you think about that thing, huh?
Rach, I think I have something that belongs to you.
I'm sure gonna miss pretending to laugh at your weird jokes
that I don't get.
No, no, they're really yours.
We found them in your old room.
These aren't mine.
Maybe Monica used to use them with--
Don't say Richard.
Well, if they're not Monica's
and they're not yours, then whose are they?
I think you're forgetting
the kinkiest former resident of that room.
- Pheebs! - Yeah!
I think these are yours.
These are not mine. Look how flimsy they are. Come on.
My God, you try to hang a guy from a water pipe with these...
...they'll snap like a piece of licorice.
- Can I talk to you alone for a minute? - Sure.
You don't really handcuff guys to water pipes do you?
Where do you think Mike really is?
Oh, honey....
Let me just saying something
because once we get into this...
...I'm gonna get all uncomfortable
and probably make some stupid joke.
I just want to say that l-- I love you.
And I'm gonna miss you.
And I'm so sad that you're leaving.
Oh, you know what?
Let's not say anything else.
I love you.
Not so tight.
I'm sorry, give me one more chance.
Okay.
Okay.
I'm sorry. Just go. Just go. I can't. I can't.
So I guess you're next. You ready?
I don't think so.
Oh, you're definitely not.
I haven't cried like that in years.
You cried yesterday at the 6:00 news.
That old woman was being scammed by her mechanic.
God, I can't believe she saved me for last.
Why are they taking so long?
I don't know.
But, God, Joey seems to be handling it surprisingly well.
- No! - No! Joey!
Okay, here we go.
- Well.... - Yeah.
I think I'm gonna take off.
Oh, you guys, this was an amazing night.
Thank you so much.
I love you.
Good night.
What?!
I don't get a goodbye?
Lucky bastard.
Unbelievable.
She says goodbye to everyone but me!
Well, maybe she thought that with all of your history,
it could be...
...you know, implicit.
Well, it needs to be "plicit."
All right, let's think about this.
I mean, there's gotta be an explanation.
Did you do anything to make her mad?
No, I don't think so.
You know, maybe she was just really spent from our talk.
- It was pretty intense. - Yeah, mine too.
- Mine was a humdinger. - Okay!
I mean, don't I deserve anything?
I mean, a few tears, a cursory hug?
Not from you!
Ross, if you're this upset,
you should go and talk to her.
And say what? You owe me a goodbye?
I mean, he's got more pride than that.
The hell I do!
- I don't get a goodbye? - What?
Everyone gets a goodbye but me?
What do I gotta do to get a goodbye?
Be best friends with you? Go out with you?
Have a baby with you?
Oh, wait a minute. Wait a minute!
I did all those things!
Ross--
Or maybe I'm just not giving you...
...enough credit.
I mean, it is difficult to say goodbye to five people.
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, g--
It's physically impossible!
You know what?
After all we've been through...
...l can't believe this is
how you want to leave things between us.
Have a good time in Paris.
I hope Ross isn't too upset.
I'm sure he's not more bummed out...
- ...than I am. - Tell me about it.
Well, you can't say
we don't know how to throw a party.
I think I'm gonna head out.
Where do you think you're going?
I thought I was going home to bed...
...but I'm sensing
there's something less fun for me to do here.
We're moving in a couple of days,
and we got a lot of packing to do.
It'd be great if you guys could pitch in.
Joey and I can finish up the guest room.
Yeah, good idea.
Oh, no. You and Phoebe are gonna help me in here.
You couldn't be cool.
We're gonna start in the kitchen.
Plates get put into plate protectors
and stacked 10 to a box.
The silverware gets bundled in rubber bands
and then bubble wrapped. Got it?
Yeah.
Good. I need you to be careful...
...and efficient. And remember, if I'm harsh with you...
...it is only because you're doing it wrong.
Hey, Mon, I think I figured out whose handcuffs they are.
You did? How?
Well, I was cleaning out the closet...
...and I found some pictures of them...
- ...being used. - Oh, my God, let me see.
Who's that dirty old lady?
Monica's grandmother.
Nana liked it rough!
- Hi. - Hey.
- Oh, here, have a seat. - Yeah.
- How was your night? - Oh, it was okay.
I went to a movie with my cousin
then out for dinner.
We went to this place that had--
Anyway, they had these really amazing cheeseburgers.
Erica, are you okay?
Yeah, you know, maybe I ate too much.
I keep getting these stomachaches.
They come and go every few minutes.
Oh, my God.
Relax, we'll just get her some antacids.
She doesn't have a stomachache! She's in labor!
Oh, my God!
Yeah, you gotta get to the hospital!
Chandler, get the coats! Erica, let's go!
Phoebe and Joey, keep packing!
Oh, my God, we're gonna have a baby.
We're gonna have a baby!
Oh, my God, we're gonna have a baby!
Oh, God, I've gotta sit down!
I've gotta sit down!
Honey, it's gonna be okay.
You can do this. Just breathe.
Okay. Okay.
Okay, I feel a little better.
Are you sure?
Yes, I'm sure. Oh, honey, let's go.
Okay.
Okay, bye, everyone!
- We're having a baby! - Good luck!
- Chandler, wait, wait, wait! - What?
If you get a second,
find out where she got that cheeseburger.
You think I didn't say goodbye to you
because I don't care?
That's what it seemed like.
I cannot believe that after 10 years
you do not know one thing about me!
Then why didn't you say something?
Because it is too damn hard, Ross!
I can't even begin to explain to you
how much I am gonna miss you.
When I think about not seeing you every day,
it makes me not want to go.
Okay? So if you think that
I didn't say goodbye to you...
...because you don't mean as much to me
as everybody else, you're wrong.
It's because you mean more to me.
So there, all right? There's your goodbye!
- Rach! - What?
- You keep-- You can't-- - What?
- A little more. - Okay.
- A little more. A little more. - All right.
Little more.
All right. All right, let's do this.
All right, ready?
Yep. Now give me your best shot.
All right. Here goes.
Doesn't work.
Previously on Friends:
Erica, are you okay?
Yeah, you know, maybe I ate too much.
I keep getting these stomachaches. They come and go, like, every few minutes.
-Oh, my God. -Relax, we'll just get her some antacids.
She doesn't have a stomachache! She's in labor!
Oh, my God!
If you think that I didn't say goodbye...
...because you don't mean as much to me as everybody else, you're wrong.
It's because you mean more to me.
-Rach! -What?
Hey.
Go back to sleep. I have to go home.
Oh, God. This was amazing.
It really was.
You've learned some new moves.
Yeah, well, this guy at work gave me "Sex for Dummies"
as a joke.
- Who's laughing now? - I am.
Friends S10E17E18 The Last One
Breathe...
Okay. Good.
Next time, can I say "breathe"?
No. Last time, you said it like Dracula,
and it scared her.
Can I get you anything? You want some more ice chips?
No, I'm okay.
All right. I'll be right back.
- Where you going? - To use the bathroom.
- You can't leave me alone with her. - What?
This is exactly the kind of social situation...
...that I am not comfortable with.
What kind of social situation are you comfortable with?
It's just that we've never spent any time, you know, alone together.
You'll be fine.
You won't, but I'll be back in two minutes.
Okay.
So any plans for the summer?
I don't know. Maybe church camp.
May not want to mention this.
So you ever wonder which is worse?
You know, going through labor or getting kicked in the nuts?
- What? - Oh, it's just interesting.
Because no one will ever know
because no one can experience both.
One of life's great unanswerable questions.
Who knows? Maybe there's something
even more painful than those things.
Like this.
- Come in. - Morning.
- Hey. - What's that?
Oh, it's my housewarming present for Monica and Chandler.
That's a baby chick and duck.
And I named them Chick Jr. And Duck Jr.
I did not see that coming.
They'll love it at that new house.
It has that big backyard.
When they're old,
they'll go to that farm...
...that Chandler took the other chick and duck to.
- Yes. - Yeah.
It's a shame people can't visit there.
That is the rule though.
Guess what. You're almost an uncle.
What?
Erica went into labor last night.
Monica and Chandler are at the hospital right now.
- Oh, my God! - I have a feeling it's gonna be a girl.
Phoebe, you were sure Ben was gonna be a girl.
Have you seen him throw a ball?
- Is Rachel here? - I think she's still asleep.
How did it go with you guys last night?
She seemed pretty pissed at you.
We worked things out.
What's that smile?
Did something happen with you two?
Hey, I'm not one to kiss and tell.
But I'm also not one to have sex and shut up.
We totally did it.
Oh, my God. You and Rachel?
I know, it's pretty great.
So, what does that mean?
Are you guys getting back together?
Oh, I don't know.
We didn't really get to talk.
But do you want to get back together?
I don't know.
It was incredible.
I mean, it just felt so right.
When I was holding her,
I mean, I never wanted to let her go.
Know what? Yeah, I do. I want to be together.
So is she still going to Paris?
Wow, I hadn't thought of that. I hope not.
This is, like, the best day ever. Ever.
You guys might get back together.
Monica and Chandler get their baby.
There are chicks and ducks...
...in the world again.
I feel like I'm in a musical.
Morning.
Guess you'll never know how it ends.
- Hey. - Hi.
- Hi. How'd you sleep? - Good. You?
- Good. - I'll bet you did.
Would you guys mind giving us a minute?
Sure. Just keep an eye on the chick and duck.
Chick and the duck? Didn't they die--?
Dive. Yeah, they dove. Headfirst into fun on the farm.
So....
- Morning. - You too.
Last night was just wonderful.
Oh, it really was.
I woke up today with a big smile in my face.
I know, me too. It was....
You know, it was one of those things
you think is never going to happen.
And then it does,
and it's everything you want it to be.
I know. It was just....
It's just the perfect way to say goodbye.
Just a little bit more, honey.
Oh, man, this hurts!
Is it really that bad?
I think it's time to kick you in the nuts
and see which is worse.
The baby's head is crowning.
Oh, my God!
That is the most beautiful top of a head I have ever seen.
- Chandler, you have to see this. - I'm okay.
Chandler. You don't want to miss this.
This is the birth of your child.
- It's the miracle of life. - All right.
Wow, that is one disgusting miracle.
Start pushing. Here we go.
Here come the shoulders.
It's a boy.
- Is he okay? - He's just fine.
You did it.
It's a baby.
A beautiful little baby.
And some other stuff I'm gonna pretend I don't see.
- Would you like to cut the umbilical cord? - Okay.
Well, that's spongy.
Hey, handsome.
I'll love you so much that
no woman is ever gonna be good enough for you.
- We are so lucky. - I know.
He has your eyes.
I mean, I know that's not possible,
but he does.
We'll just get him cleaned up a bit.
Oh, my God, he's beautiful.
Thank you so much.
I'm really happy for you guys.
- How do you feel? - I'm tired.
You don't have that much time to relax.
The other one will be along in a minute.
I'm sorry, who should be along in a what, now?
The next baby should be along in a minute.
We only ordered one.
- You know it's twins, right? - Oh, yeah.
These are the faces of two people in the know.
I can't believe you didn't know it's twins.
This has never happened before.
Well, gosh. That makes me feel so special and good.
Wait. Did you know it was twins?
It's here in the paperwork we got from the clinic in Ohio.
- Did anybody tell you? - I don't think so.
They did mention two heartbeats,
but l thought it was just mine and the baby's.
They said, "Both heartbeats are strong."
And I thought, "Well, that's good, because I'm having a baby."
This is unbelievable.
Twins actually run in my family.
Interesting.
Can I see you for a second?
What do we do?
What do you mean, "What do we do?"
Twins!
Twins!
Chandler, you're panicking.
Join me, won't you?
What do you say we keep one
and then just have an option on the other one?
- We can't split them up. - Why not?
We could give each of them half a medallion.
And then years later, they'll find each other...
...and be reunited.
I mean, that's a great day for everybody.
What if the person who adopts the other one is horrible?
What if they're not?
What if it's adopted by a king?
Yeah. Because I hear the king is looking to adopt.
Monica, we are not ready to have two babies.
That doesn't matter.
We have waited so long for this.
I don't care if it's two babies.
I don't care if it's three babies.
I don't care if the entire cast of "Eight Is Enough" comes out of there.
We are taking them home
because they are our children.
Okay.
- Okay. - Okay!
Okay.
It looks like we're about ready over here.
Come on, Erica.
Start pushing again now.
- Here she comes. - She? It's a girl?
Yeah.
Well, now we have one of each.
And that's enough.
And then she said it was the perfect way to say goodbye.
Oh, my God. What did you say?
Nothing. What do you say to that?
You've got to tell her how you feel.
- No way. - Well, you can't just give up.
Is that what a dinosaur would do?
What?
Dude. I'm just trying to speak your language.
Ross, Rachel doesn't know that you even wanna get back together.
If she did, she might feel differently.
She might not even go.
- You really think so? - I'm telling you!
Oh, ok, this is the part of the musical
where there'd be a good, convincing song.
Hi.
Can't a girl finish a song around here?
- Hey. - Hi. I dropped Emma off at my mom's.
- Okay. - You're not taking her tonight?
No. We decided I'd set up, then my mom would bring Emma to Paris on Sunday.
Eight-hour flight with a one year old.
Good luck, Mom.
You kidding?
Eight hours with my mom talking about Atkins.
Good luck, Emma.
All right. You know what? You're right.
I should at least tell her how I feel.
- Ross. Wait, wait. - What? What?
Could you get me a muffin?
- Rachel? - Yeah?
I know you're leaving tonight,
but I just have to tell you.
I love you.
Now, I don't know if that changes your plans at all.
But I thought you should know.
Gunther.
I love you too.
Probably not in the same way.
But I do.
And when I'm in a cafe having coffee...
...or I see a man with hair brighter than the sun...
...I'll think of you.
- Bye, you guys. - Bye.
Oh, my God!
Unbelievable.
Hey, you know what might help?
I'm not getting you a muffin!
Do you think they recognize each other
from in there?
Maybe. Unless they're like people who've lived in apartments...
...next to each other for years, then one day they're pushed through a vagina...
...and they meet.
We're going to take Erica to Recovery now.
There's something that we wanted to tell you.
We decided to name the girl baby Erica.
Oh, my God, that's just like my name!
Son of a gun, it is.
Anyway, I'm gonna go get some rest.
I'm really glad I picked you guys.
You're gonna make great parents.
Even Chandler.
- Okay, well, bye. - Bye.
- We'll call you. - Okay.
Have fun at church camp.
- Look at these little bunnies. - I know.
You ready to trade?
- Okay. - Okay.
Okay. Let's see.
- We could trade later. - Yeah, I'm good.
Hey, what are you working on?
A "welcome home" sign for the baby.
How sweet! Oh, is that the baby?
No, I sat in the paint.
- Hey. - So did you talk to Rachel?
- No. And I'm not going to. - What?
Why not?
She's just gonna shoot me down.
You guys saw what happened with Gunther.
That did not look like fun.
How can you compare yourself to Gunther?
I mean, sure, he's sexy
in a more obvious way.
You have a relationship with her.
You slept together last night.
Yeah, and she still wants to go.
It's pretty clear where she is.
I know what you mean. I mean, sometimes--
- Joe. - Damn it!
If I were gonna tell her,
I don't have to do it now.
Okay? I'll be seeing her again. We've got time.
No, you don't. She's going to Paris!
She is going to meet somebody.
Do you know how many hot guys there are in Paris?
It's a city of Gunthers.
- Hey. - Hey.
What do you have there?
Oh, I made a little something.
If I had more time to work on it, it'd be better, but....
Oh, my God, you did that yourself?
Honey, that's gorgeous.
You know, the baby can't read, Mike.
Hi. You guys. The car service just got here.
I can't believe they're not home yet!
I have to catch my stupid plane.
I want to see the baby.
Monica just called from the cab.
She said they should be here any minute.
Apparently, there's some big surprise.
Yeah, did she sound happy about it?
Because my friend Ethel's baby was born
with a teeny-tiny beard.
- Welcome home. - Oh, my God.
- Oh, my gosh. - Hey.
Hey.
Hey, so, what is the big surprise?
- Oh, my God! - How did this--?
Okay, awkward question.
The hospital knows you took two, right?
Yes. It's twins.
Oh, my-- They are so cute.
Now, what kinds are they?
This is a boy. And that's a girl.
Her name is Erica.
Hey, that pregnant girl's name was Erica.
Yeah. It's a shame you two didn't get to spend more time together.
Yeah, and we named the boy Jack,
after Dad.
He's gonna be so happy.
Jack Bing. I love that.
It sounds like a '40s newspaper guy.
You know, "Jack Bing, Morning Gazette.
I'm gonna blow this story wide open."
Oh, my gosh.
So beautiful.
I want one.
Oh, yeah? Well, tell me which one.
I'll try to slip it in my coat.
Seriously.
I mean, you want to make one of those?
One? How about a whole bunch?
Really?
Yeah. We can teach them to sing,
and we could be like the von Trapp family.
Only without the Nazis.
Although that sounds kind of dull.
I can't believe this.
If I don't leave now,
I'm gonna miss my plane.
I'm so glad you got to see the babies.
Me too.
I'm just sorry I'm not gonna be around
to watch you two attempt to handle this.
All right. Oh, I can't say goodbye to you guys again.
- I love you all so much. - Love you.
- We love you. - Call us when you get there.
I will. Ross, come here.
I just want you to know...
...last night...
...I'll never forget it.
Neither will l.
All right. Now I really have to go.
Okay, au revoir.
They're gonna really hate me over there.
So you just let her go?
Yeah.
- Hey, maybe that's for the best. - Yeah?
Yeah. You know, you just-- Look, you gotta--
You gotta think about last night the way she does.
Okay? You know, maybe....
Maybe sleeping together was the perfect way to say goodbye.
Now she'll never know how he feels.
Maybe that's okay, you know?
Maybe it is better this way.
I mean, now.... Now you can move on.
I mean, you've been trying to for so long.
Maybe now that you're on different continents....
Right?
Maybe now you can actually do it, you know.
You can finally get over her.
Yeah, that's true.
Except....
I don't want to get over her.
What?
I don't. I want to be with her.
Really?
Yeah. I'm going to go after her.
Yeah, you are!
Wait! Wait! Get your coat! Get your coat!
- My coat. - This is so cool!
I have no idea what's going on,
but I am excited!
What do you think she's gonna say?
I don't know.
Even if she shoots me down,
at least I won't spend my life wondering...
...what would have happened. Where is my coat?
You didn't bring one!
My cab's downstairs.
I'll drive you to the airport.
- Wish me luck. - Hurry!
Good luck!
There's no seat belts!
That's okay. If we hit anything...
...the engine will explode,
so it's better if you're thrown from the car.
- All right, all right. Let's do this. - Okay!
- Hey! - 80th and East End.
No. I don't take passengers.
The law makes you accept any fare.
You don't understand. This cab isn't real.
What's your medallion number?
My medallion number is, get out of the cab!
- What? - Get out of the cab!
Oh, hey, can I give you guys my housewarming gift now?
- Now, that you can do. - All right.
Chick Jr.? Duck Jr.?
Don't hide from Mama!
You can open your eyes now.
- Are we off the bridge? - Yes!
Is the old woman on the bicycle still alive?
Yeah, she jumped right back up.
Oh, my God. Phoebe, slow down!
Do you want to get to Rachel in time?
Yes, but I don't want to die in your cab.
You should have thought of that before you got in!
- Tollbooth. - What?
Tollbooth!
Four bucks. There are quarters in the glove compartment.
Hurry!
Okay.
Damn, that window's clean.
We were wondering what was taking so long...
...but now we understand. You were doing this.
Okay. I wanted to surprise you, but....
For your housewarming gift,
I got you a baby chick and a baby duck.
Really? You got us a chick and a duck?
Oh, great.
Just what you want for
a new house with infants. Bird feces!
But they must've jumped off the table.
Now they're gone!
Don't worry, we'll find them.
Actually, I'm gonna go check on the twins.
Oh, God! What did I just step on?
It's okay. It's just an egg roll.
You stepped on my egg roll?!
I'm sorry.
I didn't know to look for Chinese food on the floor.
Just put it on a plate and leave.
- Okay. Let's find these birds. - All right.
Wait, wait. You hear that?
They're in the table!
Well, that can't be good.
- We gotta get them out of there! - How?
Maybe we can lure them out. You know any birdcalls?
Oh, tons. I'm quite the woodsman.
Well, maybe we can just tip the table a little.
Joey, wait! The ball!
So, what do we do?
Maybe we can open this up somehow.
Okay.
No. It's all glued together.
Does that mean we have to bust it open?
- I don't know. Maybe. - Oh, my God.
I know. It's-- It's the foosball table.
All right, you know what? We don't have a choice.
It's like I would have said in that sci-fi movie
if I'd have gotten the part.
Those are our men in there, and we have to get them out...
...even if I have to sacrifice the most important thing in my life...
...my time machine.
- Did that movie ever get made? - It did not.
Ross, where are you going?
To talk to Rachel.
Isn't that why we took a ride in the death cab?
You're walking up to her at the gate?
Have you never chased anyone through the airport before?
Not since my cop show got canceled.
You have to get a ticket to get past security.
What? We're never gonna make it.
Not with that attitude. Now, haul ass!
Okay, if you could all walk slower,
that'd be great.
- Madame, your passport, please. - Oh, my God.
I was afraid I wouldn't remember my high school French.
But I understood every word you just said.
- Your boarding pass, please. - Oh, sure.
Shoot, I had it. Oh, I can't believe this.
Madame, if you don't have your--
I have it, I have it!
Okay, I can't find it,
but I remember that I was in seat 32C...
...because that's my bra size.
Madame. You must have your boarding pass--
Ok, fine. But you know what?
If I was in 36D, we would not be having this problem.
- Hi. I need a ticket. - Just one?
I drive you here,
and I don't get to see how it works out?
Fine. Two tickets. I need two tickets.
We're on our honeymoon.
And the destination?
I don't care. Whatever's the cheapest.
I'm so lucky I married you.
Oh, shoot. Damn it. Where is it?
I found it. I found it. I told you I would find it.
In your face. You're a different person.
Sorry.
Okay. Flight 421, Paris.
I don't see it. Do you see it?
No. Did we miss it?
No, no, it's impossible. It doesn't leave for another 20 minutes.
Maybe we have the flight number wrong.
God.
- Hello. - Hey, it's me. Here's Ross.
What?
Hey. Hey, listen--
You wouldn't believe the cute noises the twins are making.
Wait, listen.
But Monica--
Monica...
I'm sorry. They were doing it before.
That's all right. Listen, listen.
Oh, wait, wait. Here they go again.
Monica...
- <i>Monica? - Isn't that cute?
That is precious! Listen....
I need Rachel's flight information.
<i>Oh, okay.
All right, it's flight 421. Leaves at 8:40.
Yes, that's what I had . It's not on the board.
That's what it says here.
Flight 421. Leaves at 8:40. Newark Airport.
- What? - Newark Airport.
Why? Where are you?
JFK.
Don't worry, you guys!
We're gonna get you out of there!
And we're also gonna buy you tiny bird hearing aids.
Okay. Here goes.
What's the matter?
I need to say goodbye to the table first.
I understand.
Okay.
Table...
...you have given us so many great times.
And you guys, Jordan, Victor, Joel....
All of you guys. What can I say?
You guys make us look good.
- You want to say anything? - I don't know.
Except that, for one last time....
Good game...
Good game.
Okay. Here we go.
I can't do it.
Well, I can't do it either.
Hey. Did you find them?
Yeah. They're stuck inside the table.
And we have to bust it open, but neither of us can do it.
Oh, well, sure. It's got to be so hard.
I'll do it. Give me.
Phoebe!
No, no, no!
Wow, I've never gone this fast before.
Phoebe, forget it, okay?
Newark is, like, an hour away.
There's no way we'll make it in time.
She's got her cell. You could call her.
I am not doing this over the phone.
You don't have any other choice.
- Hello? - Rachel. Oh, good.
By the way, did you just get on the plane?
- Yeah. - For what is worse, we would have caught her...
...if we were at the right airport.
- Rachel, hang on. - <i>No. No. No.
Phoebe, is everything okay?
Actually, no. No. You have to get off the plane.
- What? Why? - I have this feeling that...
...something's wrong with it.
Something is wrong with the left phalange.
Oh, honey, I'm sure there's nothing wrong with the plane.
Look, I have to go.
I love you, and l will call you the minute I get to Paris.
What was that?
Oh, that was just my crazy friend.
She told me to get off the plane
because she had a "feeling" that there...
...was something wrong with the left phalange.
Okay. That doesn't sound good.
Oh, I wouldn't worry about it.
She comes up with this stuff,
and she's almost never right.
But she is sometimes.
Well....
What are you doing?
I can't take this plane now.
Excuse me, sir. Where are you going?
I have to get off this plane.
Her friend has a feeling
something's wrong with the left phalange.
Could I get some peanuts?
What's wrong with the plane?
There's nothing wrong.
The left phalange.
There's no "phalange."
Oh, my God. This plane doesn't even have a phalange.
- I'm not flying on it. - Ma'am. Please sit down.
What's going on?
We're getting off. There is no phalange!
This is ridiculous. I--
Yeah, okay.
All right. My job here is done.
That was impressive.
Yeah. You didn't even use the tools for most of it.
Yeah, they were just slowing me down.
All right. I gotta get back to the babies.
See you girls later.
- Sorry about the table, man. - Yeah.
You gonna buy a new one?
Probably not. No.
I don't know how much I'm gonna want to play
after you go.
- At least we got these little guys out. - Yeah.
We were worried about you.
I guess I better get used to things
crapping in my hand, huh?
I'm gonna miss these little guys.
It was nice having birds around again.
Hey, you know what?
Maybe we should keep them here with you.
What?
Yeah. We got a lot going on right now.
And plus, here, they'd have their own room.
I could get a goose!
You know, I think you're set with the poultry.
Thanks, man. You hear that, you guys?
You're gonna get to stay here.
And it's good...
...you know, because....
Because now you have a reason
to come visit.
I think there may be another reason.
So....
Awkward hug or lame cool-guy handshake?
Yeah, well, you know,
lame cool-guy handshake.
Ma'am, I assure you, the plane is fine.
And you fixed the phalange?
Yes. The phalange's fixed.
As a matter of fact,
we've put a whole lot of extra phalanges onboard,
just in case.
- Where is she? - I don't see her.
- Rachel! Rachel Green! - There she is!
Rachel! Rachel!
Whoa, do you have a boarding pass?
No. I just have to talk to someone.
I'm sorry. You need a boarding pass.
- No, no. But you don't-- - Rachel!
What? Oh, my God.
What are you guys doing here?
Okay. You're on.
What? What, Ross?
Okay, you're scaring me. What's going on?
- Okay. Thing is.... - Yeah.
- Don't go. - What?
Please, please stay with me.
I am so in love with you. Please don't go.
- Oh, my God. - I know. I know.
I shouldn't have waited till now to say it,
but-- That was stupid, okay? I'm sorry.
But I'm telling you now.
I love you.
Do not get on this plane.
Miss, are you boarding the plane?
Hey, hey.
I know you love me. I know you do.
- Miss. - I....
l.... I have to get on the plane.
- No, you don't. - Yes, I do.
- No, you don't. I do. - They're waiting for me, Ross.
I can't do this right now,
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Rachel.
I'm so sorry.
I really thought she'd stay.
I know.
I'm sorry.
Well, that's it.
Everything's packed.
This is weird.
I know.
Yeah.
Does this mean there's nothing to eat?
I put three lasagnas in your freezer.
I love you.
Hey.
Hey. Did you guys make it in time?
Yeah, yeah.
He talked to her, but she got on the plane anyway.
Where's Ross?
He went home. He didn't want to see anybody.
<i>Ross. Hi, it's me.
<i>I just got back on the plane,
<i>and I just feel awful.
<i>That is so not how I wanted
<i>things to end with us.
<i>It's just that I wasn't expecting
<i>to see you.
<i>And all of a sudden you're there
<i>and saying these things.
<i>Now I'm just sitting here
<i>and thinking...
<i>...of all the stuff I should have said
<i>and I didn't.
<i>I mean, I didn't even get to tell you
<i>that I love you too.
<i>Because of course I do. I love you.
<i>I love you.
<i>I love you.
<i>What am I doing? I love you.
<i>I've got to see you.
<i>I've got to get off this plane.
Oh, my God.
<i>Okay, excuse me.
<i>Miss, please sit down.
<i>No, I'm sorry. I'm really sorry,
<i>but I need to get off the plane.
<i>I need to tell someone that I love them.
<i>Miss, I can't let you off.
Let her off the plane!
<i>I am afraid you are gonna have to take a seat.
<i>Oh, please, Miss. <i>You don't understand.
Try to understand!
<i>Come on, miss, isn't there any way
<i>that you can just let me off the--<i>?
No! No!
Oh, my God. Did she get off the plane?
Did she get off the plane?
I got off the plane.
You got off the plane.
I do love you.
I love you too,
and I am never letting you go again.
Okay. Because this is where I want to be.
No more messing around.
I don't want to mess this up again.
Me neither. We're done being stupid.
Okay. It's you and me, all right? This is it.
This is it. Unless we're on a break.
Don't make jokes now.
Okay, please be careful with that.
It was my grandmother's. Be careful.
Thank you.
If that falls off the truck,
it wouldn't be the worst thing.
I know.
Seems smaller somehow.
Has it always been purple?
Look around, you guys.
This was your first home.
And it was a happy place,
filled with love and laughter.
But more important,
because of rent control, it was a frigging steal.
Hey, do you realize that, at one time or another,
we all lived in this apartment?
Oh, yeah. That's true.
I haven't.
What about that summer during college
that you lived with Grandma...
...and you tried to make it as a dancer?
Do you realize we almost made it 10 years
without that coming up?
Oh, honey, I forgot.
I promised Treeger that we'd leave our keys.
Oh, okay.
- So I guess this is it. - Yeah.
I guess so.
This is harder than I thought it would be.
Oh, it's gonna be okay.
Come on.
Do you guys have to go to the new house now,
or do you have some time?
We got some time.
- Okay. Should we get some coffee? - Sure.
Where?
