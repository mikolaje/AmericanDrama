会有一个派对012---We're having a party.
能不能等我们回来再举办呢012---Can't you have the party when we get back?
不要啊  那就不是她真正的生日012---No. It won't be her real birthday.
如果她就一岁012---Gee, if only she were 1
也不知道生日到底是什么就好了012---and had no idea what the hell a birthday was.
这对我们很重要呢012---Come on, you guys, this is really important to us.
很抱歉  我和钱德勒真的012---Sorry, but Chandler and l could really
希望一起度个假日012---use a weekend away...

我在《马克西姆》杂志看到的012---I read about it in Maxim.
你们可以选择其他日子吧012---Well, can't you just go to Vermont the next day?
我们非常希望大家都能来...012---Yeah, we want everyone to be there.

对我妹妹做那些奇怪性事012---weird sex stuff to my little sister.
你们听着  这是一件大事呢012---And, I mean, you know, you guys, this is a big deal.

你知道吗  菲比012---You know, Pheebs,
我小的时候过生日...012---when I was little, on my birthday...
我爸会在家里012---...my daddy would hide a present
每个房间藏礼物012---in every room of the house.
然后会给我们"宝藏地图"012---And then he would draw a treasure map
叫我们自己找012---to help me find them all.
我喜欢这种家庭习俗012---I love family traditions like that.

-嗨  大家  -嗨012---- Hey, guys. - Hi.
我带了摄像机  来录艾玛的派对012---I brought the camera for Emma's video.
喔  好呢012---Oh, good!
我们想要录艾玛的派对012---We had this idea to make a birthday video for Emma...
当她十八岁时  再拿给他看012---...and we'll give it to her when she's 18.
酷012---Oh, cool.
-就像一个"时空胶囊"  -是啊012---- Wow, it's like a time capsule. - Yeah.
想象一下  到时她就会用一个现在还未发明的012---Oh, just think, she's gonna be watching that video on a TV...
电视机来看这个影带012---...that hasn't even been invented yet...
跟现在和她一样还是婴儿的朋友一起看012---...with friends who, right now, are just, like, babies.
然后  他们住在一个浮起来的城市012---And they'll be living in a floating city that the humans built...
为了逃避蚂蚁人012---...to escape the ant people.
希望是如此012---That's the hope.
所以  艾玛起来了吗012---So is Emma awake yet?
没有  现在午睡时间012---No, it's still naptime.
不过  马上她就醒了012---But she'll be up soon.
乔伊在哪里呢012---Where's Joey?
我说过了  现在是午睡时间012---I said, it's still naptime.
-嗨  乔伊叔叔来了  -嘿012---- Hey, there's Uncle Joey. - Hey.
说句话给十八岁生日的艾玛吧012---Hey, say something to Emma on her 18th birthday.
-十八岁了  -乔伊  不要012---- Eighteen, huh? - Joey, no!
怎么啦  怎么啦  是要给她很辣的朋友012---What? What? It's for her hot friends.
当她们看到这个  你已经是五十二岁了012---When they see this, you'll be 52.
就是我开始想稳定下来的时候呢012---And starting to think about settling down.
乔伊  帮我把这个支起来012---Joey, will you please set this up for people
这样就可以放艾玛的礼物012---to put Emma's presents on?
非常愿意呢012---Love to. Yeah.
我们要给她礼物吗012---We were supposed to bring presents?
是啊  我写了一首歌给艾玛012---Yeah. I wrote Emma a song.
我怎么会知道呢012---Oh, yeah. How was I supposed to know?
这是一个生日派对啊012---Joey, it's a birthday party.
是啊  但她仅一岁而已012---Yeah, but for a 1-year-old.
有什么意义012---What's the point?
那天她对着杯子大笑一个多小时012---The other day she laughed for an hour at a cup.
只是一个普通杯子上面有阿母穿的像农夫的图案012---Just a cup with a picture of Elmo on it, dressed as a farmer.
阿母站在牛旁边  牛说  "阿母..."012---And he's standing next to this cow, and the cow says, "El-moo."
真是好笑的杯子012---Man, that's a funny cup.
-嗨  -嗨012---- Hey. - Hey.
生日的女主角呢012---Where's the birthday girl?
她还在睡觉呢012---Oh, she's still napping.
当然  她昨晚知道要办一个派对012---She was probably up all night excited about the party
肯定太兴奋了  睡不着012---she knows is happening.
我知道你们很想去佛蒙特012---I know you guys really want to get to Vermont,
对你们也是一件大事012---and this isn't a big deal to you.
但这对我们也是一件大事  好吗012---But it really is to us, okay?
艾玛不会再有第二次的一岁生日012---Emma will never have a first birthday again.
好的  你对  我们很抱歉012---You're right. We're sorry.
那把艾玛叫醒012---Let's wake up Emma
开始派对吧012---and get the fun time started!
她昨晚睡不好所以我们不能叫醒她012---She didn't sleep well last night, so we can't wake her.
你是不是在跟我开玩笑啊  姓格林的012---Are you frigging kidding me, Greene?
-嗨  -嗨012---- Hi! - Hey!
很高兴你们来了012---I'm so glad you came.
真不敢相信  艾玛已经一岁了012---I can't believe Emma's already 1.
我还记得你的一岁生日012---I remember your first birthday.
罗斯很嫉妒我们把注意力都放在你身上012---Ross was jealous of all the attention we were giving you.
他很用力地去拉他的蛋蛋012---He pulled on his testicles so hard...
我们不得不要带他去看急诊012---...we had to take him to the emergency room.
有些关于你爸爸的事情你还不知道012---There's something you didn't know about your dad.
盖勒先生和太太012---Hey, Mr. And Mrs. Geller.
我帮你放下来吧012---Let me help you with that.
-谢谢  -太好了012---- Thank you. - Oh, man, this is great, huh?
我们三个又聚在一起012---The three of us together again.
你们怎样会更有趣吗012---You know what would be fun?
就当做这礼物是我们三个人012---If we gave this present
一起送给艾玛的012---to Emma from all of us.
你是哪一位啊012---Which one are you?
真不敢相信  艾玛还在睡012---I can't believe Emma's still asleep.
我知道  怎么办啊012---I know. What are we gonna do?
我有计划  一个好计划012---I've got a plan. I've got a plan.
我会把这个盘子012---I'm going to ram this platter
很用力的砸到你肋骨上012---really hard into your ribs.
那你会痛的哇哇大叫012---You're gonna scream out,
这样会吵醒她012---and that'll wake her up.
我不会和这种莫妮卡去佛蒙特的012---I'm not going to Vermont with this Monica.
嗨  菲比  你知道吗012---Hey, Pheebs? You know what?
即然你写了歌给艾玛012---I was thinking since you wrote a song...
那我也可以用我的才能给艾玛做些事012---...maybe I could do something for Emma using my talents.
所以  你要去泡她012---So you're gonna hit on her?
不是  不是啦  我的才能是表演啊012---No, no, no. My talents as an actor.
我可以  可以...012---You know, I could, like, maybe....
给她边读本书边演出来012---I could do a dramatic reading of one of her books.
或是  你可以把一个叉子叉在苹果上012---Or you could stick a fork in an apple.
我想艾玛会喜欢的012---Hey, I think Emma might like it.
艾玛会喜欢什么012---Oh, Emma might like what?

分开的的表演呢012---Separate performances.

你知道吗  因为大家很不耐烦012---People are getting a little antsy
要等艾玛起来012---waiting for Emma to wake up from her nap.
所以  你们可以现在表演一个吗012---So would you mind performing them once now?

上礼拜我和你是过的啊012---The one I told you about last week.
什么  你根本没有说过任何试镜012---What? You never said anything about an audition.
那我重新说012---Let me start over.
我刚接到一个试镜通知012---I just got a call about an audition.
你现在去还来得及012---I think you can still make it.
就在紫苑戏院012---It's down at the Astor Theater,
还要自己带独白012---and you need to have a monologue prepared.
独白  我没有...012---A monologue? I don't have a--

那我要走了012---So I'm gonna take off.

我有按摩客户会随时到我家门外呢012---I've got a massage client waiting outside my door any minute.
房间的钱我们已经付了012---And we paid for a room
我们早该在里面012---that we're supposed to be in right now!
好好012---Well, okay, now...
只要有一个人照顾艾玛就行了012---...only one of us has to stay with Emma.
因我刚发现这点所以我可以走了012---Okay, and as the person who realized that, I get to go.
不行...012---No...
那我们想一个较公平的方法来决定谁要留下来012---Let's figure out a fair way to decide who's staying.
有了012---Oh, I got it.
大家选择一到十的数字012---Okay, everyone pick a number from one to 10, all right?
谁选到最大的数字可以先走012---Whoever gets the highest number gets to go first.
好喔  我选"十"012---Okay, 10.
莫妮卡选"十"  那我选"九"012---Okay, Monica picks 10. I call nine.
还有其他的吗012---Anyone else?
-大家来抽签吧  -好012---- No, let's just draw straws. - Okay.
或是可以扔硬币  答对次数...012---Or we could flip a coin and multiply the answer--
-拜托你  不要讲话了  -好  .012---- I'm begging you to stop. - Right.
这样好啦  我们从艾玛的012---Okay, how about this?
生日礼物选一个发条玩具012---We got wind-up toys for Emma.
拿来赛跑012---We can make them race,
哪个跑最后的  就要留下来012---and whoever comes in last stays.
好吧  就这样012---Yeah, let's do that!
这好像比我们要012---That sounds more fun than the thing
在佛蒙特做的事情好玩012---we were gonna do in Vermont!

不  不  你们等一下012---No. No, no. Wait.
我们没有输呢012---We didn't lose.
规则是说012---The rules clearly stated that
最后跑到终点才是输家012---the last one to cross the finish line was the loser.
那我们的狗012---Well, our dog never crossed
没有跑到终点  所以...012---the finish line. So technically--
他们已经走了012---They left.
根本没时间去面包店012---There isn't time to go to the bakery.
所以我们现在回家了012---We're gonna come home.
大家已经走了012---Everybody left?
好吧  告诉艾玛012---All right. Well, just tell Emma
我们会尽快回家  再见012---that we'll be there as soon as we can. Bye.
-瑞秋  -喔  天啊  抱歉012---- Rachel! - Oh, God, sorry!
真不敢相信  他们给了你一个罚单012---I can't believe they gave you a ticket.
你是多好的驾驶员012---You're such a good driver.
-艾玛醒了  -是喔012---- Emma's awake. - Yeah?
真不敢相信012---I can't believe this.
在她的一岁生日012---This is her first birthday,
她醒来时我们不在012---she's awake, we're not even there.
大家也都走了012---Everybody left.
还加上这个烂蛋糕012---We still have this stupid obscene cake.
也许我可以弄好这蛋糕012---Hey, maybe I can fix that.
试试看  改成别的形状嘛012---You know, try to turn it into something else.
已经无所谓了012---Oh, don't even bother.
我们已经毁了她的第一个生日012---We've already ruined her first birthday.
你不知道012---And do you know
这些早期的经验对她有多重要吗012---how important these early experiences are,
罗斯  非常重要012---Ross? Very!
你给我的那本书背面是这么说的012---According to the back cover of that book that you gave me.
瑞秋  她不会记得这些012---Rach, she's not gonna remember this.
也许吧012---I guess.
我本来想像着012---Oh, I just had such an idea
今天会是怎样的一天012---of what this day would be like, you know?
艾玛在笑012---Emma laughing...
大家围绕着蛋糕012---...and everybody gathered around her cake,
唱"生日快乐"012---singing "Happy Birthday."
然后我们...012---And then we would all--
嘿  不要挡老娘的路012---Hey, get out of the road,
白痴新手012---you stupid student driver!
他们总要学这点012---They have to learn.
-嘿  -什么012---- Hey. - What?

天啊  你把它变成小兔子了012---Oh, my God. Look, you made it into a bunny.
你怎么弄的012---How did you do that?
我把这俩东西改成脸颊012---Well, I just made these two things cheeks.
把这东西分成两份  变成耳朵012---And then I split this to make ears.
我非常感动呢012---Well, I am very impressed.
有些人会唱歌  有些人会跳舞012---Some can sing, some can dance.
我显然的可以012---I, apparently, can turn phallic cakes
把"小弟弟"改成兔子蛋糕012---into woodland creatures.
还有另外一种方法来整理玩具012---Now, another way to organize your stuffed animals
就是按照大小012---is by size.
对不起  这是给艾玛玩的游戏012---I'm sorry, is this a game
还是给莫妮卡012---for Emma or for Monica?
游戏012---Game?
艾玛 你知道今天是你生日吗012---Emma, do you even know it's your birthday today?
你一岁了012---You're 1.
就是一岁  这么小012---One year old. That's little.
好丫头012---That's my girl.
这就是你的年龄012---That's how old you are.
是我教她的吗012---Did I teach her that?
我传授智慧给她012---Did I just impart wisdom?
我也想要有一个012---I want one.
我也是012---Me too.
这里又没人012---There's no one around.
干脆我们把这个带走012---Why don't we just take this one?
-然后跑去加拿大  -我在开玩笑012---- And head to Canada. - I was kidding.
我可没有呢  快点出发吧012---I wasn't. Let's get going.
嘿  罗斯和瑞秋回来了吗012---Hey, are Ross and Rachel back?
还没有呢012---No, not yet.
喔  好耶  我没错过派对嘛012---Oh, good, I didn't miss the party.
那你的按摩客户呢012---What about your massage client?
我觉得很内疚如果错过这派对012---I just felt so bad missing this.
所以我给他吃了点东西012---So I just slipped him a little something, you know.
只要我五或六个小时后012---As long as I'm back in five or six hours,
能回去就行012---it'll be all right.
好012---Okay.
如果罗斯和瑞秋问起我012---If Ross and Rachel ask,
就说我一直待在这里  一直012---I've been here the whole time. The whole time.
我一直待在这里的012---I've been here the whole time.
乔伊  我们刚看到你进来012---Joey, we just saw you come in.
而且你跑上来时  在楼梯有超过我们012---You ran past us on the stairs.
我不管你有没有离开012---I don't care that you left.
我很高兴你们现在在这里012---I'm just glad that you're here.
谢谢大家012---Thanks, you guys.

天啊  我们女儿是一个天才012---Oh, my God, our daughter's a genius.
-这表示...  -不要有科学的说教了012---- This means-- - No! No science camp!
真是的  我把蜡烛放到蛋糕上012---Damn it! I'll put a candle on the cake.
艾玛  看看你的娃娃012---Oh, and, Emma, look at your stuffed animals
排得如此整齐012---lined up so neatly.

这就是我想要的012---This is just what I wanted.
蛋糕已变成兔子形状的012---Hey, you made it into a bunny.
我怎么啦012---What is wrong with me?
为什么我觉得"小弟弟"的形状时看来比较好吃012---It looked more delicious when it was a penis.
