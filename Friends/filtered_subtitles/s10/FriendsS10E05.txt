嘴巴爽一秒  屁股胖一生012---"A moment on the lips, forever on the hips."
在我家不需要这种屁话012---I don't need that kind of talk in my house!
乔伊  我知道她难相处012---Joey, look, I know that she's difficult...
但她来这里也不错012---...but I think it's really good that she's here.
这样她滚蛋后我们才能更欢喜012---Because we'll appreciate it more when she's gone?
不  只是  我刚来这城市的时候012---No, it's just-- Look, when I first moved to this city,
还不是一样012---I was a lot like her.
被惯坏  自我中心012---I was spoiled, self-centered.

你知道吗012---You know what?
现在我们也许应当坐下来012---I was thinking that maybe now would be a good time...
好好谈谈你的将来012---...for us to sit down and, you know, talk about your future.
我没空012---Oh, I can't, honey.
我要去修眉012---I'm gonna go get my eyebrows shaped.

给她讲讲我们去年怎么过的周年012---Tell her about us last year.
我给钱德勒买了一只500块的表012---Well, I bought Chandler a $500 watch,
而他  给我写了首饶舌歌012---and he wrote me a rap song.
-真的  -用的办公软件012---- Seriously? - Word.
我的比你还逊012---Mine was worse than that.
怎么啦012---Well, what happened?
球赛时012---We were at the game.
有人在大屏幕上求婚012---This guy proposed to his girlfriend on the big screen thing.
老套012---That is so tacky.
我也是那么说012---Well, that's what I said.
结果呢  原来迈克昨晚上就想用012---But it turns out Mike was planning on
这种方式向我求婚012---proposing to me the same way last night.
天  迈克要求婚012---Oh, my God. Mike was gonna propose?
大件事012---That's huge.
你想嫁他吗012---Do you want to marry him?
当然想啦012---Yeah, I really do. Yes.
结果我那句话把他堵回去了012---But after I dumped on the way he was gonna do it...
我想他一辈子都不会求婚了012---...l don't think he'll ever ask again.
在巴贝多斯我拒绝过他一次了  现在又一次012---I said no in Barbados, and now this?
没错  如果我是男人012---She's right. If I were a guy and....
我刚才是不是说  如果我是男人012---Did I just say, "lf I were a guy"?
别等他求婚了012---You don't need him to propose to you.
主动出击吧012---Maybe you could propose to him.
哦  不知道012---Oh, I don't know.
我又不是想嫁想疯了012---I don't know. Isn't that a little desperate?
我向钱德勒求的婚012---I proposed to Chandler.
好吧  继续讲012---All right, moving on.
我不觉得你想嫁想疯了012---I don't think it was desperate.
我觉得你很棒012---It was amazing.
谢谢012---Thank you.
你们都认为我该求婚012---Well, do you think I should propose?
那一定很棒012---I think it could be kind of great.
当然012---Absolutely.
世上再没有比求婚012---You'll love the feeling.
更美妙的感觉了012---There's nothing like it.
好  那么以何种方式呢012---Okay. Okay. So how should I do it?
就在球赛的大屏幕上啊012---How about at a game on the big screen?
那去体育用品专卖店吧012---How about at a Foot Locker?
他既然选择过大屏幕求婚012---What? What, he obviously thinks
可见他能接受这种方式012---that's a nice way to be proposed to.
而且他也不会起疑心012---Plus, he'd never suspect it.
有理012---Yeah, that does make sense.
你们会喜欢吗012---Okay, now, would you two like that?
我喜欢012---Sounds good to me.
不过男性会怎么想012---But what would a guy think?
-奶奶电话  -哇012---- Nana's on the phone. - Wow.
有趣012---That's interesting,
她七年前就死了012---since she died seven years ago.

今天你看艾玛可以吗012---Can you watch Emma today?
不行  我要连堂上课012---I can't. I have back-to-back classes.
莫利说她生什么病012---Did Molly say what she had?
我的喉咙也不舒服012---Because my throat's been hurting.
痛经012---Menstrual cramps.
我可能不是这毛病012---I don't think that's what this is.

抱歉  亲爱的012---No, I'm sorry, sweetie.

我可以帮忙012---Well, I could do it.

能跟你说句话吗012---Can I talk to you for a second?
我不想让她看我们的孩子012---I do not want her babysitting our child.
为啥012---Why not?
首先  她老是把我们的孩子喊成"艾拉"012---For one thing, she keeps calling her Ella.
这名字也不错嘛012---Ella's a nice name.
好  下一胎叫"艾拉"012---Fine, we'll call the next one Ella.
-下一胎  -好012---- The next one? - Okay.
我不赞成她帮我们看孩子012---I don't want her watching our baby.
我只是想改造她012---Ross, I am trying to help her become a better person.
这是个好机会012---This is a huge breakthrough for her.
她刚刚主动要求012---She just offered to do something
帮助别的人类了012---for another human being.
我不确定012---You know, I don't know.
罗斯  我是说012---Ross, I'm telling you...
她宁愿牺牲修眉的时间看孩子012---...she's giving up getting her eyebrows shaped to do this, all right?
你知道这件事012---Do you understand
对我们女人来说牺牲多重大吗012---how important that is in our world?
我不小心听到你们的谈话012---Listen, I couldn't help but overhear,
因为我想听012---because I was trying to.
就让我带孩子吧012---Listen, let me do this.
我真心想帮你们012---I really want to help you guys out.
