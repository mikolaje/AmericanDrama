Friends, family, we're gathered to celebrate here today...
...the joyous union of Ross and Emily.
Now Ross, repeat after me.
I, Ross.
I, Ross.
Take thee, Emily.
Take thee, Rachel.
Emily.
Heh. Emily.
Uh, shall I go on?
He said "Rachel", right?
Do you think I should go up there?
Yes. Yes. Do go on.
I think we'd better start again.
Ross, repeat after me.
I, Ross.
Take thee, Emily.
Take thee, Emily.
Ha, ha. Like there'd be anybody else.
As my lawfully wedded wife, in sickness and in health...
...till death parts us.
As my lawfully wedded wife, in sickness and in health...
...until death parts us.
Really, I do. Emily.
Do you have the rings?
Emily, place this ring on Ross' finger...
...as a symbol of your bond everlasting.
Ross, place this ring...
...on Emily's hand as a symbol...
...of the love that encircles you forever.
Happy to.
Ross and Emily have made their declarations...
...and it gives me great pleasure to declare them husband and wife.
You may kiss the bride.
This is worse than when he married the lesbian.
Just keep smiling.
Okay...
Well, that went well. Yeah.
It could've been worse. He could've shot her.
Ha, ha. That was pretty funny, wasn't it?
Friends  S05E01  The One After Ross Says Rachel
You spoiled everything. It's like a nightmare.
All my friends and family are out there. How can I face them?
How could you do this to me?
Hey, no matter what happens with Ross and Emily...
...we still get cake, right?
That's all right. No, no. You take your time, sweetie.
I'll be out here. Ha, ha.
She's just fixing her makeup.
I hate you.
And I love you.
Boy, a bad time to say the wrong name, huh, Ross?
That's true. Thanks, Dad.
People should be dancing, huh?
Hey, this is a party. Come on.
Joey. Dance.
Yes, Waltham Interiors.
Hello, this is Ross Geller's personal physician, Dr. Phalange.
Who?
Yeah, I discovered that Ross forgot to take his brain medicine.
Um, now, without it, uh, in the brain of Ross...
...uh, women's names are interchangeable.
Through no fault of his own.
Oh, my God. Phoebe.
No, not Phoebe. Dr. Phalange.
Oh, no. You have it too.
Hello?
Hey. Hey.
Wow, I hope you don't take this the wrong way...
...but I know we had plans to meet up tonight and...
Ugh. I'm just kind of worried about what it might do to our friendship.
I know.
Ugh. How could we have let this happen? Seven times.
You know, look. We were away.
In a foreign, romantic country. Right.
I blame London.
Bad London.
So look, um...
...while we're still in London, I mean, we can keep doing it, right?
Well, I don't see that we have a choice.
But when we're back home, we don't do it.
Only here.
You know, I saw a wine cellar downstairs.
I'll meet you there in two minutes. Okay.
Mon? Mon, I got to ask you something. Now?
Ross said my name up there. I mean, come on.
I just can't pretend that didn't happen can I?
I don't know.
Monica, what should I do? Just do the right thing.
What?
Tow the line. Thread the needle. Think outside the box.
Monica, wait, listen. I'm gonna talk to Ross about what he thinks it meant.
Wait. Rachel, no.
He's married.
Married.
If you don't realize that, I can't help you.
Okay. You're right.
You're right. You can't help me.
Jack, is it all our fault? Were we bad parents?
Yes.
Oh yeah? Well, who serves steak when there's no place to sit?
I mean, how are you supposed to eat this?
Hey, what's up?
Where were you? We were supposed to meet.
Forget it. That's off. Why?
The next tour of the wine cellar...
...will commence in two minutes.
Joey, what are you doing?
You promised Phoebe you wouldn't eat meat until she has the babies!
Well, I figured we're in another country, so it doesn't count.
That's true. The man's got a point.
Oh, hi.
Hi. Hi.
I'm sorry things aren't working out so well.
Oh, no. Ha, ha. It could be better. It's gonna be okay, right?
Oh, yeah. Of course. I mean, she's gonna get over this, you know?
I mean, so you said my name.
You know, you just said it because you saw me there.
If you'd seen a circus freak, you would've said:
I take thee Circus Freak.
It didn't mean anything. It's just a mistake.
It didn't mean anything.
Right? No, no.
Of course it didn't mean anything.
I mean, uh well, I can understand why Emily would think it meant something...
...you know, because it was you.
But it absolutely didn't. It didn't! It didn't!
Ross, hey, the band's ready outside for your first dance with Emily,
Oh. Oh, the band's ready.
Well, we got to do what the band says.
I don't care about the stupid band!
You spit on me, man.
I'm sorry.
Emily is taking kind of a long time, huh? Heh.
Y'know When I locked myself in the bathroom at my wedding...
...it was because I was trying to pop the window out of the frame.
Right. Get the hell out of there. You know?
Emily.
I'm coming in.
Oh, look at that. Same thing.
In the middle of everything...
...if I scream the word "yippee," just ignore me.
Huh! Oh, my God. Rachel. Oh, hello, Rachel.
Ross said my name.
Okay? My name.
Ross said my name up there.
That obviously means that he still loves me.
Okay, don't believe me. I know I'm right.
do you guys want to go downstairs and get a drink?
Yes, we do.
But we have to change first.
Yes, I want to change.
why don't you go down and get us a table? Yeah, We'll be down in five minutes.
Fifteen minutes. Ha, ha.
Hello.
Oh, Pheebs. It's Phoebe.
Oh, hey, hey. Oh, great.
Hi.
So, what happened?
Well, Ross said my name.
Yeah, I know, but I don't think that means anything.
Okay, Pheebs, y'know what, let's look at this objectively.
All right, ninth grade, right?
The obsession starts.
All right? Summer after ninth grade...
...he sees me in a two-piece for the first time.
His obsession begins to grow, right?
Hey, listen, why don't we go change in my room?
My clothes are... Oh.
Wow, you look... No time for that.
Okay.
Hey, dude. Let me in. I got a girl out here.
Well, I've got a girl in here.
No, you don't. I just saw you go in there with Monica.
Well, we're hanging out in here.
Which one of us is gonna be having sex in there? Me or you?
Well, I suppose I would have to say you.
What if we're watching a movie in here? Which we are.
And we've already paid for it. It's My Giant.
My Giant? I love that movie.
You really think this is okay?
Well, Ross and Emily aren't gonna use it.
Oh, it's so beautiful.
You know, I don't feel right about this.
Oh, Monica...
This is the honeymoon suite.
The room expects sex.
The room would be disappointed if it didn't get sex.
All the other honeymoon suites would think it was a loser.
Okay.
Emily? Nope. Not under here.
You didn't find her? No, I've looked everywhere.
Well, you couldn't have, or else you would've found her.
I think you should keep looking. Yeah. For about, uh, 30 minutes?
Or 45?
Wow, in 45 minutes, you could find her twice.
No. For all I know, she's trying to find me...
...but couldn't because I kept moving around.
No, from now on, I'm staying in one place.
Right here.
It's getting late. Yeah, We're going to go.
Actually...
...do you guys mind staying here for a while?
Ugh. You know, we got to get up early and catch that plane to New York.
Yeah, it's a very large plane.
That's cool.
But we'll stay here with you.
Thanks, guys. Ha, ha.
I really appreciate this, you know, but you don't need to rub my butt.
We have to leave for New York in an hour.
I know. I've been looking at those doors.
They look pretty soundproof, don't you think?
We can't do that. That's insane.
I mean, A, he could wake up. And B, you know...
...let's go for it.
Emily? Emily.
Emily! Nope.
Forget about Emily. She's not with us. We've come for her things.
Where is she?
She's in hiding. She's utterly humiliated. She doesn't want to see you ever again.
We're very sad that it didn't work out between you and Emily, monkey.
But I think you're absolutely delicious.
Excuse me, I'm standing right here.
Oh, yes.
There you are.
Hey. Hey, you guys. Hurry up. Get some. There's a whole cart outside.
Goodbye, Geller. Now, hold on. Hold on.
Look, look. Your daughter and I...
...are supposed to leave tonight for our honeymoon.
Now, you tell her that I'm gonna be at that airport...
...and I hope that she'll be there too.
Yeah, I said Rachel's name, but it didn't mean anything.
She's just a friend. That's all. Now, look, just tell Emily I love her...
...and that I can't imagine spending my life with anyone else.
Please, promise me that you'll tell her that.
All right, I'll tell her.
Come on, bugger face.
Call me.
You spend half your life in the bathroom.
Why do you never go out the bloody window?
Well, maybe it's best we never got to do it again.
Yeah, it kind of makes that one night special.
You know, technically, we still are over international waters.
I'm going to the bathroom. Maybe I'll see you there in a bit?
Okay.
Hey, can I ask you something?
Uh, no.
Felicity and I, we were watching My Giant. And I was thinking...
...I'm never gonna be as good an actor as that giant.
Do you think I'm just wasting my life with this acting thing?
No.
I mean, the giant's like five years younger than me.
You know, you think I'll ever get there?
Yes.
Thanks, man. Okay, man.
But what about how much taller he is than me?
I mean, there's no way I can make myself taller now.
And who knows what science will come up with in the future...
...but, Chandler, what if I die an unsuccessful, regular-size man?
Hey, Monica. Wow, you've been in the bathroom for, like, a half-hour.
I know.
Had the beef tips, huh?
Hey.
You ate meat!
You had sex!
No, we didn't. I know you didn't.
I was talking about Monica.
Phoebe, I did not have sex.
Oh, this pregnancy is throwing me all off.
I'm gonna say hi to the chick and duck. Oh, me too.
Why would you need to say hi? You've been feeding them for four days.
Oh, right. Maybe I'll just go home.
Well, we certainly are alone.
Yes! Good thing we have that "not New York" rule.
Right.
Um, listen, since we're on that subject...
...um, I just wanted to tell you that, um...
Well, I was going through a really hard time in London...
...what with my brother getting married and that guy thinking I was Ross' mother.
Right.
Well, anyway, I just...
That night meant a lot to me. And I guess I'm trying to say thanks.
Oh.
You know, that night meant a lot to me too.
And it wasn't because I was in a bad place or anything.
It just meant a lot to me because you're really hot.
Is that okay? Ha, ha. That's okay.
And I'm cute too?
And you're cute too. Thank you.
All right, I got to go unpack. Okay.
Bye.
I'm still on London time. Does that count?
Oh, that counts. Oh, good.
Rach.
Rach. Hi.
What are you doing here?
Well, I've been on standby for a flight home for hours.
Oh. Oh. So no sign of Emily, huh?
Not yet.
So, um...
What time are you supposed to leave?
This is the last call for Flight 1066 to Athens.
The last call.
Pretty soon, I guess.
I'm sorry.
I just... I don't understand. I mean, how could she do this?
What, am I like a complete idiot...
...for thinking she'd actually show up?
No.
You're not an idiot, Ross.
You're a guy very much in love.
Same difference.
All passengers for Flight 1066 to Athens should now be onboard.
I get it!
Well, that's that.
No, you know what?
I think you should go.
What? Yeah, I do think you should go...
...by yourself. Get some distance.
Clear your head. I think it would be really good.
Oh, I don't know.
Oh, come on, Ross. I think it would be really good for you.
I could. I could do that.
Yeah.
I can't even believe her.
You know what? I am going to go.
Good. Why not?
Right? Right. Right.
Thanks. Okay, I'll see you back at home.
If I ever get a flight out of here.
Hey, well...
No. What? Wait, what?
Why don't you come?
I mean, I have two tickets. Why not?
Well, I don't know, Ross. Really?
Yeah, yeah. It'd be great. I mean, you can...
You can lay on the beach...
...and I can cry over my failed marriage.
You see how I make jokes? Uh-huh.
Really. I mean...
God, I could use a friend.
Oh, wow. Okay, maybe.
Yes, I can do that.
Cool. All right, cool.
Okay, we're going to Greece. Yeah, okay.
Aah, aah. I forgot my jacket.
Well, you tell them to wait. Okay.
Wait. Wait. Okay.
Emily.
Oh, no, no, no.
No! No!
Emily!
Ah, yes. I will have a glass of the Merlot...
...and he will have a white-wine spritzer.
Hey, look at that. The airport's moving.
Hey, are we moving?
Are we moving? Why are we moving?
They... Um...
Yeah, does the captain know that we're moving?
Oh, my gosh.
Cheers. Cheers.
You look cute in bubbles.
Ahh, you're just all liquored up.
Hey, it's me. I'm coming in.
I've had a very long, hard day.
Ahh, I'm gonna go get some chicken. Want some?
Ahh, no thanks. No chicken, bye-bye then.
You sure? Some extra crispy? Dirty rice? Beans?
For the last time, no! Get out, Get out, Joey!
All right.
Are you okay? I'm so sorry, he wouldn't leave.
He kept asking me if I wanted chicken.
Chicken?
I could eat some chicken.
Hey, Joe!
Yeah, can I get a, uh, three-piece, some coleslaw, some beans and a Coke?
Aah! Diet Coke.
Friends  S05E02  The One With All The Kissing
Hey. Hey.
Morning, Pheebs. I have to tell you this story.
Okay, I was coming over and this cabdriver...
Was his name Angus?
What?
He was a cabdriver we had in London.
All right. Anyway...
What was that pub he took us to?
The Wheat Sheaf!
And they had that beer...
Boddington's. Boddington's.
Ooh, uh, Pheebs was going to tell a story.
Yeah, so, he had a really funny hat.
I don't want to talk about it.
Hey. Hey, Ross!
Boddington's!
Oh, man!
That was good beer. Y'know, I'd walk back to London for another frosty one of those bad boys.
Y'know, I think they have those at that British pub near the trade center.
Later!
Isn't Rachel supposed to be back by now?
Yeah, but her plane got delayed in Athens.
But actually, she should be here by now.
Oh, so-so you talked to her. Did she, did she sound mad?
No. But she likes me.
You abandoned her on a plane to Greece.
Okay, I did not "abandon" Rachel. Okay?
Emily showed up at the airport.
I had to go after her. I mean, I-I did what I had to do!
She's my wife. Rachel is my wife.
Y'know—Emily!
Emily is my wife.
Man, what is that?
So you still hadn't heard from Emily?
No, Not since I lost her at the airport.
I can't believe she can out run you man!
Hey! She's fast, okay?
Oh! You think you can beat me? Let's go! Outside!
Hi!
Hi! Rachel!
Rach, I am so sorry. I am so, so sorry.
Come on. You just did what you had to do.
Hi, Pheebs.
That's it? You're not mad? I mean, It must've been terrible.
Terrible? Hell, I was in Greece!
There was a nice hotel, nice beach, met the nice people.
It's not too shabby for Rachel.
So, what, that's it?
Well, yeah. We're cool. Totally cool.
Thanks, Rach. You're the best.
Oh, no. You're the best.
Oh, I got to go to the flower store.
Check it out, No one will tell me where Emily is...
...so I'm gonna send 72 long-stemmed, red roses to her parents' house.
one for each day that I've known and loved her.
That oughta get her talking to me again.
Oh, Ross,When you make out the card, be sure to make it out to "Emily."
Rach, that's great! It's so good that you had a good time in Greece!
What?
I didn't have a good time in Greece!
Ross abandoned me!
Okay, I couldn't get a plane out. so I had to stay in their honeymoon suite
with people coming up to me all the time going, "Oh, Mrs. Geller, why are you crying"
I mean, it was so humiliating!
I felt like such an idiot!
It's all my fault. And you know why,
Because I make very bad decisions.
Oh, that's not true.
Yes, it is true. I went,I went after Ross in stupid London!
London is stupid! Stupid!
Phoebe, you were right. I should've never gone to London.
and from now on, you make all my decisions for me.
Oh, no. I did that for someone once.
I'm not comfortable having that kind of power and control over someone's life.
I'll do it.
That's fine. So Monica, you are now in charge of my love life.
Okay. I got to go to work.
And, uh, Rachel, great to have you back.
Pheebs!
Always a pleasure.
Rachel? Sweetie, look.
it's a really cute picture of Joey and you at the reception.
Ohh, He's married.
Ross is married. I can't-I still can't believe it.
Honey, sweetie, by the edges.
I mean, y'know I'm just gonna have to accept it
I mean, it's my fault.
Sweetie! Edges! Fingers! Smudgey!
Oh, my God!
Okay. That's okay. I know that you're very upset right now.
I know, I know that wasn't about me.
I bet it was about her a little.
If you'd stop thinking about Ross for one minute...
...you'd notice there are great guys everywhere.
you look. Gunther.
He's nice. He's cute.
Yeah. I guess Gunther is...
What about that guy over there?
Remember? That's the guy you flirted with at the counter that time.
Oh, I don't know. I don't know.
You're going to talk to him.
Y'know what? We made a deal, I make your decisions and I say you're going to talk to him.
All right.
You're the boss. I guess. I got to do what you tell me.
Say that to him, and you're golden.
Hey. Hey.
Hey, Pheebs. We got our pictures back from London.
Here's all of us at the Tower of London...
Here we all are.
Yeah, There's Ross and Joey and you and...
And me.
y'know what, we've been talking about London too much haven't we?
No. I'm sorry. it's just because I couldn't be there.
'Cause all I ever get to do now is pregnant stuff, it just bums me out.
I'm sorry. Sorry.
What happened? Well, y'know, A little of this, a little of that.
Got myself a date tomorrow night.
See? Didn't I tell you? You're getting over Ross already.
Get out.
What took you so long?
I got caught up at work. But I'm quitting tomorrow.
So thanks for having me over.
Rach...
Pheebs...
See you, man.
What the hell was that?
Probably some European goodbye thing he picked up in London.
That's not European.
Well, It felt French.
Oh God, I really had a good time.
Yeah, me too.
So...
I guess this is it.
Yeah, um...
Unless you want to come inside? Yeah!
Oh, uh, wait a minute. You know what? I can't decide this.
Okay. Just hold on a second.
Um, hi.
Hi.
Is Monica around? I have to ask her something.
Doing her laundry.
What's that?
It came in the mail today.
it's uh, 72 long-stemmed, red roses.
One for each day that I've known and loved Emily...
...cut up into mulch.
Oh, honey that's awful.
It's not so bad.
Monica's going to make potpourri.
I think I'm going to go wander out in the rain for a while.
It's not raining.
I can't catch a break.
Y'know what Ross? You're not going anywhere. Sit right here.
I'm gonna make you a cup of tea and we're gonna talk this thing whole out.
All right?
Okay.
Hey, Dave. Yeah.
Umm, listen, I'm gonna need to take a rain check, my roommate is just really sick.
Okay. Bye.
Honey, listen.
I know things seem so bad right now..
...and that they won't get any...
Can I talk to for just a minute?
I dropped some socks.
Yeah.
What is the matter with you? Do you want to fall into the trap? Do you want to fall into the trap?!
You did not drop any socks!
I just ran into Dave, and he told me that you blew him off!
I mean, You listen to me!
Now, I'm calling the shots! I say you leave Ross and go get Dave.
What the hell were you trying to do?
Well, ultimately I was trying, you know, I wanted...
...tell him y'know, that I'm still in love with him..
What? You cannot tell him that!
Why? Why not?
People love to hear that!
I make the decisions and I say no!
Well, You know what? No, you don't make my decisions, because...
...you're fired.
You can't fire me.
I make your decisions, and I say, "I'm not fired!" Ha!
Well...
Rachel! Come on, let me in!
Having some trouble?
Rachel locked the door.
I'll kick that door in if you give me some sugar.
Rachel! Let me in!
Thank you.
Rachel? Can I talk to you outside for a sec?
No.
We really need to talk to you.
Well, then talk.
Okay, I will.
Remember that thing we just discussed that you wanted to do?
Yes.
What thing?
Rachel wants to take swing dance lessons.
Which I think is a really stupid idea.
It's dangerous. she's never gonna get what she wants.
And who knows who she might end up hurting?
Monica's right. Swing dancing can be tricky.
I have to use the phone.
I got to cancel those five, giant teddy bears I sent to Emily.
My God. Think of the massacre.
I'm going to do it.
Rachel, I know-I know you think I'm crazy.
But before you tell him you love him, just-just try to find one person...
...who thinks it's a good idea. I bet you can't. But I…
Please?
All right. Fine.
Joey! I'm in!
All right. Good deal.
Pheebs! Hey! Pheebs!
Uh, okay, Pheebs? Yeah?
Um, y'know how the other day you were talking about how you didn't get to go to London ...
...and you were feeling left out? Yeah.
Well, we all felt really bad about that so...
...we decided to take a little trip together.
Oh, that's so nice!
How great! where? Where's the trip?
Well, we thought we would all go to a picnic...
...in Central Park! Central Park?
Yeah, All of us. All day.
That sucks!
That's not a trip! I just came from the park!
What are we gonna high five about at the stupid Central Park?
It's right by my house. All right!
I'm going home to bask in the triumph of my Central Park idea.
Hold on a sec there, Mr. Kissy.
Y'know, I've been meaning to talk to you about...
...this whole, little, new European thing you've got going on.
and I just need to tell you that it makes me very uncomfortable...
...and I just, you know, just stop it!
I was just trying to bring a little culture to the group.
That's fine. Just don't bring it in my mouth.
Makes me wanna puke!
Hey, everybody! Pheebs is here!
Phoebe! Whoo! Okay. Whoo! Hi!
Okay, Pheebs, we decided that the picnic idea was a little...
It didn't have any... Well, it blew.
So, we thought that this afternoon we'd all go away for the whole weekend...
...to Atlantic City.
Ooh, Atlantic City! Oh, that's a great plan! Whose plan was that?
Mine!
Wait. It was my plan. No...
...I said we needed a new plan.
And I came up with Atlantic City.
Which is the new plan.
Okay, well, why don't we all meet upstairs in an hour?
Okay.
I'm going to go pack. I'm going to go pack my ass off.
Come on Rach, let's go.
Yeah, y'know what? I'm-I'm gonna meet you upstairs in a minute.
No! Rachel, you didn't find anyone, so you can't tell him.
Well, You know what? That doesn't matter.
Okay, Rachel, do you have any idea how painful it is to tell someone you love them...
...and not have them say it back?
I don't care.
Okay...
I can't watch.
What you reading?
Paper.
Yeah? What's it about?
The events from around the globe.
Okay...
Uhh, Ross, there's something that I-that I have to talk to you about
and everybody's saying that I shouldn't tell you,
But I think they're wrong. I mean, and you know how people can be wrong.
Sure. Once at work...
...I thought carbon dating is fossilized...
I'm really trying to tell you something here.
Go ahead.
Umm, okay, I think I'm-I'm just gonna-just gonna say it.
Just gonna say it. Uhh,
I'm still in love with you, Ross.
Huh. I'm...
Wow. Umm...Huh...I'm-I'm not sure what to do with that right now.
What? Was that a joke? Because it's mean.
I'm so dead serious.
I'm totally serious.
Why are you laughing?
Because I just heard it!
I heard it! And it's ridiculous!
I mean...
You're married!
You're married, and it's just ridiculous.
and it's like, When I said it, I sort of floated up out of my body.
y'know? And then I heard myself say it, and then the floating Rachel...
I was like, "You are such an idiot!"
Well, I am married. I know.
Even though I haven't spoken to my wife since the wedding.
I'm sorry. That's not funny.
Actually, it kind of is.
My wife won't return my calls.
I don't know where my wife is.
"Hey, Ross! Where's the missus?" "Don't know!"
Oh, God.
Okay.
You know what? do you think that you just forget that I told you this?
Well, I kind of have to.
I mean, Because the thing is...
The thing is, you know, that you're married to Emily.
That is what the thing is.
Oh, God.
Ross, Things won't be weird between us, right? Was that stupid?
Me telling you that?
No, no. I'm glad you did.
Look, If nothing else...
...it's always great when someone tells you they love you.
That's what I said!
Thank you for being so nice. No. Thank you for...
Thank you.
Okay, let's go! Yeah, Atlantic City!
Come on!
Atlantic City, baby!
Let's roll some bones. Hey, Joey!
High-five for rolling bones.
Uh, Pheebs, you're leaking.
Oh, my God. Your water broke.
Oh! Okay!
Well, don't worry. I call shotgun.
Pheebs, we have to take you to the hospital now.
Pheebs, the babies are coming now.
Honey! High-five! The babies are coming!
Wait, wait,Remember when my water broke?
I can't believe Phoebe's going to have her babies.
I know. It's beautiful and amazing.
Y'know what else I can't believe? I had to kiss Phoebe and Rachel every time I left the room.
I mean it's too bad they didn't see us having sex.
Do you know anything about women?
No.
It's all right. Okay.
Hi. Hi.
Hi. Yeah, hi. I'm, um, Phoebe Buffay and I have babies coming out.
Okay. Have you started having contractions?
Not yet. Um, I heard they really hurt. do they hurt?
Well... Oh, my God.
And now, Which of you is the father?
Oh no, None of them are. The father is my brother.
Okay.
I am so gonna miss watching you freak people out like that!
Okay, uh Pheebs,
Look! This is for the babies to look at someday.
so is-is there anything you want to say? Y'know before it all starts?
Okay. Um...
Hi, kids! Um, it's me, Aunt Phoebe.
Can't wait to see you. Please don't hurt me.
What took you so long?
Your cab left when ours did.
We went back because I forgot my jacket.
You-you're not wearing a jacket.
Oh, man! I did it again!
Okay, so umm, somebody has to call Frank and Alice.
And then My mom might... Joey, What are you doing?
I've got to get the before shot.
Friends  S05E03  The One Hundredth
Hi, Pheebs? Okay, so just spoke to the nurse. The reason your doctor is late...
...is because, uh, she's not coming.
What? Apparently she fell in the shower and hit her head.
Oh, my God. She's so stupid!
Pheebs-Pheebs it's going to be okay.
That's easy for you to say, I don't see three kids coming out of your vagina.
Listen. y'know what? The nurse said the doctor is wonderful.
Yeah, He's head of the department.
All right. Ooh. Oh, dear God, save me.
I'm having my first contraction.
Oh, it's not bad. Okay.
And so the miracle of birth begins. And I...
You okay?
Something hurts.
Ooh, it's sympathy pains. Oh, that's so sweet.
Are they? I didn't know I cared that much.
Hello. Hi.
Phoebe, I'm Dr. Harad. I'll be delivering your babies.
I want you to know, you're gonna be in good hands. I've been doing this for a long time.
I'll be back in a minute to do your internal,
in the meantime, just relax because everything here looks great.
And also, I love Fonzie.
Did he just say he loves Fonzie?
That's what it sounded like.
All right.
Hey!
Hey! Am I late? Am I late? Nobody came out yet, right?
No-no-no! we haven't started yet. Where's Alice?
Uh, Delaware. She's on her way though, so until she gets here, I'm gonna be your coach.
But don't worry, She told me about the LaMazda stuff.
Yeah, that's when if you get the babies out by the end of the month..
...they give you 2% financing.
Yeah.
Monica, you're going to be very proud of me.
I just got us dates with two unbelievably cute nurses.
Oh, my.
They're male nurses.
Heh, heh. Not in my head.
Anyway, they want to take us out Saturday night. What do you say?
Um...
I don't think so. What?
What are you talking about?
You-you're the one who's been telling me to get over Ross and move on.
I'm moving on, and you're moving on with me. Come on,
give me one good reason why you don't wanna go.
Umm, why don't you give me something that would be a good reason ...
...and-and then I'll tell you if it's true.
What? Harder than it sounds, isn't it?
Okay, you're coming with me, and I also told them that if we're still here when they get off ...
...that we'll go down to the cafeteria and have some Jell-O with them.
Yep. There's always room for Jello.
Joey, how do you make that dirty?
It's easy. I can do it with anything. Watch uh,
Grandma's chicken salad...
Ross!
Get a shot of this.
Hey, babies, these are the headlines when you were born.
Okay, now girl baby, turn away. And boy babies...
...check it out.
This is what naked women looked like the month you were born.
All right, now let's dive right into the good stuff
Oh, okay, I'm having another one!
Ooh, I was kind of hoping that was it.
Hey, where are Monica and Rachel anyway?
A couple of nurses asked them out. Maybe they're with them.
Really? Male nurses?
Yeah, I was bummed too.
So they're going on dates?
When? I think Saturday.
What's with him? Um, sympathy pains.
I thought it was really sweet at first, but now I think he's trying to steal my thunder.
Okay.
Let's see what we got here.
Oh, you know, Fonzie dated triplets.
This-this Fonzie person you keep referring to...
...is that another doctor?
Oh no-no-no.
Fonzie is the nickname of Arthur Fonzerelli.
The Fonz.
All right.
Soon.
It's not that weird, is it?
It's very weird.
I don't want some guy down there telling me I'm "dilated-a-mundo."
To be fair, He doesn't seem to be impersonating Fonzie...
What are you doing?
Why are you defending him? Just get me another doctor...
...One who is not crazy and who is not Fonzie!
Again, it's not that he…Aah! Aah!
Oh-hey-hey-hey! there you are.
Um, listen there's something I think you should know.
Is this about you dating the nurse? Joey told me.
and I am so-so fine. I mean, you and I we're just, y'know, we're nothing
Just goofing around.
Umm, actually I was about to tell you that I was, I was going to get out of it,
but hey, if we're just goofing around then uh, maybe I will go out with him.
Fine. Maybe I will too.
Hey, you guys! Look what I found in the gift shop...
Oh. Get up! Get up! Get up!
Okay, Pheebs?
This is Dr. Oberman.
He has no strong feelings about Fonzie...
...or any of the Happy Days gang.
Hi! you're going into what grade?
I'm actually a first-year resident. but I get that a lot, you see, I-I graduated early…
Uh-huh. Me too.
Ross, maybe I should've specified that I'd be needing a grown up doctor.
Really, I'm fully qualified...
Shh, Doogie. Shh.
Doesn't anybody understand that I'm going to be having babies soon? Huh?
Go! Go little boy, go!
Oh, cool. You made him cry!
Mr. Tribbiani, I'm afraid you've got kidney stones.
Uh, well, what else could it be?
It's kidney stones.
Or...
Kidney stones.
All right, You're getting there.
Oh, and y'know, These babies are very, very lucky.
They are? Why?
They have the honor of being born on The Fonz's half-birthday.
Happy birthday.
Just to clarify.
I'm not Fonzie.
Honey, y'know I just gotta tell you,I think this is such a terrific thing you're having these babies for Frank and Alice.
I know, it is. Yeah.
Can I tell you a little secret? Yeah.
I want to keep one.
Oh, I'm going to be on the news.
Okay, Phoebe, honey, you gotta be kidding.
You know you can't keep one of these babies.
Why not? Maybe I can. You don't know.
Yes! Yes! Yes, I do! I do know! Frank and Alice will want to keep all their children.
Maybe not. You know?
Seriously, three babies are a handful.
maybe they're y'know, looking for a chance to unload one of them.
Listen, I-I hate to miss an opportunity because I didn't ask.
Phoebe, no. This is insane.
Just ask him.
What? Me?
I can't ask him!
Do you have any idea how inappropriate that would be?
All I'm saying is, just talk to Frank. Okay?
Just, y'know, feel him out!
No! Forget it! I am not gonna ask Frank to give you one of his kids.
You're right.
Tell him it's for you.
Feeling better, sweetie?
Maybe a little.
Wish you hadn't seen me throw up.
Me too.
Hey. I just heard. What's up?
Kidney stones.
Ordinarily, Mr. Tribbiani, we try to break the stones up with shock waves.
But they're too close to the bladder now.
Which means we can either we wait for you to pass them or else go up the urethra...
No, no, no. Nothing is going "up," okay?
"Up" is not an option. What's a urethra?
Are you crazy?
So did you ask him?
No, I haven't had a chance to be alone with him yet.
I'm kind of on a clock here.
Oh, Fonzie.
You know who I always liked? Mork.
Undo it. Undo it. Undo it.
Fonzie met Mork.
Mork froze Fonzie.
Yeah...
Yes...
...but Fonzie was already cool.
So he wasn't hurt. Right?
Yeah, that's right.
How you doing?
Okay. Doctor says any minute now.
You know, Alice is going to be here so soon.
You couldn't just do me a favor and, like, hold them in?
Sorry Frank, I'm kinda in the middle of the last favor you asked me to do.
Hey, Rachel. Hi!
Monica. This is Dan, one of the guys we're going out with on Saturday.
Dan, Monica.
Nice to meet you.
Hello, Dan.
I'm really looking forward to Saturday night. Really! Really!
So Dan...
Nurse, not a doctor, huh?
Kind of girlie, isn't it?
Chandler. That's okay.
I'm just doing this to put myself through medical school.
And it didn't feel "girlie" during the Gulf War.
Sure.
Thanks for doing that for us, by the way.
So, Why wait till Saturday? Are you free tomorrow?
Sure. I'll get somebody to cover my shift.
Aw, great.
Hey, how 'bout it? You, me, Saturday night?
No. All right, very good!
This is a big one.
Unh! Get these things out of me!
Breathe! Breathe through the pain.
I want the drugs, Ross! I want the drugs!
I do too! I do too!
Yeah, I love you. Okay, bye.
Hi. Hi.
That was Alice's mom. she said she left five hours ago.
She should be here by now!
Oh, honey, She's gonna make it on time.
Yeah. Yeah.
So Frank...
Three babies. Whoo, that just seems like a lot, huh?
Not to me.
Yeah, fair enough.
Okay, You're at 10 centimeters. Time to start having some babies.
All right,I want only the father here.
We love you. Good luck.
Bye, Dan! Uh, bye, Monica.
All right, I need a clamp, a sterile towel and Channel 31.
What is that?
Oh, my God!
Oh, no, no! It's a good one. Fonzie plays the bongos.
All right, Ready? Time to try pushing.
Are you ready? Time to try peeing.
Wait, wait, wait, wait! It's almost time to try peeing.
Okay, now push! That's it push! Just concentrate on pushing!
Yeah, here we go!I see the head.
Yes, it is a head!
All right. Keep pushing. Come on.
I can't believe somebody's coming out of you right now.
There's somebody coming out of you!
Is it? It's my son.
All right.
Here's your first baby.
Yes!
Yes! We got a baby boy!
Frank Junior, Junior!
Oh, How does he look?
So gross!
Okay. You ready to push again?
I already had a baby. Leave me alone.
Come on, you can do it. You can do it.
Yeah!
Little Leslie's here! We got another one!
Oh, my God! I can't believe I have two children.
How scary is that?
Come on, little Chandler, it's time to be born. Come on little Chandler! Come on!
He's coming! Yes, he's coming!
Hey, where's his thing?
Chandler's a girl!
Oh, God. Kindergarten flashback.
They musta read the sonogram wrong. 'Cause they, 'cause they thought it was a boy,
But Chandler's a girl! Chandler's a girl!
Okay, keep saying it.
Am I too late? No, no. Everything's okay.
Everybody's healthy there's 30 fingers and 30 toes.
We have our babies?
Yeah.
We have our babies.
Oh, my God.
You did it, man.
Would you like to see them?
They're so small.
So, I'll call you tomorrow. Great.
So, are you really gonna go out with that nurse man?
Well uh, You and I are just "goofing around."
I thought, why not "goof around" with him?
Y'know, I don't know if you've ever looked up the term goofing around in the dictionary
Well, I have...
...and the technical definition is:
"Two friends who care a lot about each other...
...and have amazing sex...
...and just want to spend more time together."
But if you have this new fangled dictionary that gets you made at me, ...
...then we have to, y'know, get you my original dictionary.
I am so bad at this.
I think you're better than you think you are. Really?
Okay. So if...
Know when to stop. I sensed that I should stop.
So we're okay? Yeah.
I'm gonna go tell Dan that it's not going to happen.
Don't do the dance. Right.
I think you're my favorite.
Which one do you have? I don't care.
Hi.
Hey.
So uh, Frank and Alice wanted me to tell you that they're still outside making phone calls.
But umm, I mean, did you talk to them about, you know...
Yeah, um...
No, honey.
It was a long shot.
Hey, You guys? Can I just have a second alone with the babies?
Yeah.
So here you are.
Seems like yesterday I was talking to you in that little petri dish.
Everyone said labor was the hardest thing I'd ever have to do,
But they were wrong. This is.
Well, I had the most fun with you guys.
I wish I could take you home and see you every day.
Okay, I'll settle for being your favorite aunt.
I know Alice's sister has a pool, but you lived in me.
Okay, so we're cool.
We're going to be great.
Little high-fives.
Well, if you're going to cry...
Phoebe, we are so proud of you. You're amazing!
I know.
So does it really hurt as bad as they say?
Yeah. You won't be able to take it.
So uh, now that little Chandler turned out to be a girl, what are they gonna name her?
They'll call her Chandler.
Kind of a masculine name, don't you ...
Works on you.
Come in.
I've been waiting for you.
Hi, I just...
Ah! Oh, my God! Monica!
Oh, my God!
I'm sorry! I was...
I was taking a nap.
Since when do you take naps in that position?
Oh God Monica, tell me you were waiting for a guy! Please tell me you were waiting for a guy!
Yes, I was. A guy.
From work.
I'm seeing a guy from work! Ha!
That cute waiter guy from your restaurant.
The one that looks like a non-threatening Ray Liotta?
Aha. That one!
Y'know what, just give me a second and I'll be out of your hair. I'm just going to grab a jacket.
When I get back, I want every little detail.
Maybe that's him.
Okay, um... Okay, um...
It's just Joey and Ross.
Why aren't you at the movie?
We were, but Ross was talking so loud on his phone, they threw us out.
I had to talk loud because the movie was loud!
He's talking to London. My God.Did he get in touch with Emily?
Well no, not yet. He's calling everyone on her side of the family
...hoping someone will help him get in touch with her.
I don't care if I said some other girl's name, you prissy old twit!
Ross.
Way to suck up to the family!
I'm so glad you guys are all here! My office finally got wrinkle-free fax paper!
Friends  S05E04  The One Where Phoebe Hates PBS
Hey Oh, no, no! Vomit tux! No, no! Vomit tux!
Don't worry, I had it dry-cleaned.
Vomit tux?
Who vomited on...
You know what? What you up to, Joe?
They're doing this telethon thing on TV.
And my agent got me a job as co-host!
That's great!
A little good deed for PBS, plus some TV exposure.
That's the kind of math Joey likes to do.
Oh, PBS!
What's wrong with PBS? What's right with them?
Why don't you like PBS?
Okay, 'cause right after my mom killed herself,I was just in this really bad place, you know, personally.
So I just thought it would make me feel better if I wrote to Sesame Street.
Because they were so nice when I was a little kid.
No one ever wrote back.
Well y'know a lot of those Muppets don't have thumbs.
All I got was a lousy key chain! And by that time I was living in a box.
I didn't have keys!
I'm sorry, Pheebs.I just wanted to
do a good deed, like you did with the babies.
This isn't a good deed.
You just want to get on TV. This is totally selfish.
What about you having those babies for your brother?
Talk about selfish!
What are you talking about?
Well, yeah, it was a really nice thing and all, but it made you feel really good right?
Yeah, so?
It made you feel good so that makes it selfish.
Look, there's no unselfish good deeds. Sorry.
Yes, there are totally good deeds that are selfless!
May I ask for one example?
Yeah, it's... You know, there's...
No, you may not!
That's because all people are selfish.
Are you calling me selfish?
Are you calling you people?
Sorry to burst that bubble, Pheebs, but selfless good deeds don't exist.
Okay?
And you know the deal on Santa Claus, right?
I'm gonna find a selfless good deed. I'm going to beat you, you evil genius!
Hello? Hello, Ross?
Emily?
Oh, my God! Oh my God, It's Emily!
It's Emily, everyone! Shh! Shh! Shh!
Ross, I'm only ringing to say stop harassing my relatives. Goodbye.
Wait! Okay,Okay, you can hang up, but I'm gonna keep calling! I'm gonna, I'm gonna call everyone in England
if that's what it takes to get you to talk to me!
Really? About what?
Look, you're my wife. We're married.
You know, I love you.
I really miss you.
I miss you too.
Well, at least I think I do.
She's talking.
Hey, Joey, When you said "the deal with Santa Claus," you meant?
That he doesn't exist.
Right.
So Chandler, have you heard about Monica's secret boyfriend?
Uhh, yeah. She uh, she uh, she might have mentioned him.
So, Mon, when are we going to meet this new, secret waiter man?
He's really shy. I don't think he's up to meeting everyone yet.
Yeah, I don't think he's up to meeting everyone yet.
I don't care, I wanna meet this guy who's the best sex she ever had.
Really?
That's what you heard? You said that?
I might have said that.
Why is that funny?
Because I'm very happy for him.
And you! You lucky dog!
Hi. Hey.
Well, Emily's willing to work on the relationship.
That's great! Yes!
In London.
What? She wants me to move to London.
But you live here.
You know that.
What-what-what are you gonna do?
I bet if I talked to Carol and Susan...
...I could convince them to move to London with Ben.
I'm sure your ex-wife would be more than happy to move to another country...
...so you can patch things up with your new wife.
It could happen.
How you doing? Welcome. Good to see you.
This'll be your phone.
That's great.
But I'm not really expecting a lot of calls.
No, you answer it and take pledges.
But I'm the host.
No, Gary Collins is the host. You'll be answering the phone.
You don't seem to understand. See, I was Dr. Drake Ramoray.
Well, here's your phone, doctor.
I can't believe I can't find a selfless good deed.
You know that really old guy that lives next door to me?
I snuck over there and raked up all the leaves on his front stoop.
But he caught me, and he force-fed me cider and cookies.
Then I felt wonderful. That old jackass!
Maybe Joey's right. Maybe all good deeds are selfish.
I will find a selfless good deed. Because I just gave birth to three children...
...and I will not let them be raised in a world where Joey's right!
Hey, Monica? Can I ask you a cooking question?
Sure. If you're cooking on the stove...
...does that mean that your new secret boyfriend is better in bed than Richard?
Chandler.
Is he?
Well, y'know I think I'm going to respect the privacy of my new, secret boyfriend.
Why?
I mean If this guy was me...
...and it's me who'd learned that it was me who was the best you'd ever had...
...I'd be going like this
All right, Emily.
As much as I love you...
...I'm sorry, I can't move to London without Ben.
I understand that would be difficult.
Would you please consider moving here? I mean You were moving here anyway.
Why can't you just do that?
I don't know. It's just...
Okay, okay, but I know that even though I've been a complete idiot up till now...
...you have to come here.
You have to, so we can work this out together.
All right.
All right? Did you just say "all right"?
I did. Now I'm the idiot.
Emily, that is so great!
It's gonna be so great!
We're going to be like two idiots in love!
Ross, there's one thing that really scares me still.
Yes, tell me. You have to understand...
...how humiliating it was for me up on that altar...
...in front of my entire family, all my friends.
I know. I am so sorry.
And then, after deciding to forgive you...
...seeing you at the airport, catching our plane with her.
Again, very sorry.
I mean, I can't be in the same room as her.
It drives me mad thinking of you being in the same room as her.
Emily, there is nothing between Rachel and me.
Okay?
I love you.
All right.
I'll come to New York and we'll try to make this work.
That is so great!
As long as you don't see Rachel anymore.
So I asked Emily if she would come to New York.
And she said yes.
Yes! Ooh-ohh! No, no, no.
Only if I promise never to see Rachel again.
What? You can't...
What did you tell her?
I told her I'd have to think about it.
I mean, how the hell am I supposed to make this kind of a decision?
I'm actually asking you!
Well, you can't just not see Rachel anymore.
She's one of your best friends.
But he can't not see Emily, I mean that's his wife!
That's true! Yeah, right?
But you've known Rachel since high school and you cannot just cut her out of your life.
That's true! No, you cannot.
Thanks for the help. Problem solved!
Hello? Hey, Mon.
Oh, hey, Joey. We've been watching all day. When are you gonna be on TV?
See, There was kind of a mix-up in my agent's office...
...but I'm still on TV, and that's good exposure.
You're not on TV.
Oh, okay. How about now?
Yeah! There he is! There he is!
Hello, New York!
Now maybe just put the whole duck right in there. Who cares? y'know?
Now I got the legs.
How many times have I told you guys to never watch the cooking channel?
Hi, Chandler. Hey.
Listen, I need that broiling pan that Joey borrowed the other day.
That was yours?
We used it when the duck was throwing up caterpillars.
Williams-Sonoma, fall catalog, page 27.
Expect it in 4 to 6 weeks.
Umm, hey, umm, Joey's gonna be at the telethon for the rest of the day.
We have the whole place to ourselves.
Yeah, so?
Well I just, thought maybe you'd want to book some time with "the best you've ever had."
You know what, champ?
I think I'll pass.
Why? Why?
What's your point?
PBS Telethon.
Hey, Joey.
I just wanted to let you know that I found a selfless good deed.
I went down to the park and I let a bee sting me.
What good is that going to do anybody?
It helps the bee look tough in front of his bee friends.
The bee is happy, and I am definitely not.
You know, the bee probably died after he stung you.
Damn it!
Back on in 30 seconds, people!
Excuse me, would you mind switching with me?
No way. I'm in the shot, man.
Come on man! You've been here all day! I'm taking pledges.
And we're on three, two...
Welcome back to our fall telethon.
Now If you've been enjoying the performance of Cirque du Soleil...
...and you'd like to see more of the same kind of programming, it's very simple.
All you have to do is call in and pledge...
...and at that time tell one of our volunteers what type of programming you...
Okay.
That's it. I cannot make this decision. It is too difficult.
So I'm just going leave it entirely up to the gods of fate.
A Magic 8 Ball?
You can't be serious, you can't make this decision with a toy!
Ooh, it's not a toy.
I don't know what else to do!
I either keep my wife and lose one of my best friends...
...or I keep my friend and get divorced for the second time before I'm 30.
So if anyone else has a better suggestion, let's hear it.
Because I got nothing! Don't be shy.
Any suggestion will do.
Okay, then.
Here we go.
Magic 8 Ball...
...should I never see Rachel again?
"Ask Again Later."
Later is not good enough!
"Ask Again Later."
What the hell?
This is broken! It is broken!
Let me see.
Will Chandler have sex tonight?
"Don't Count On lt."
Seems like it works to me.
PBS Telethon.
Hi, Joey.
Hey, Pheebs.
I'd like to make a pledge.
I would like to donate $200.
Two hundred dollars?
Are you sure Pheebs? I mean, after what Sesame Street did to ya?
I'm still mad at them, but I also know that they bring happiness...
...to lots of kids whose moms didn't kill themselves.
You know, so...
...by supporting them, I'm doing a good thing, but I'm not happy about it.
So there! A selfless good deed.
And you don't feel a little good about donating the money?
No, it sucks. I was saving up to buy a hamster.
A hamster? Those things are, like, 10 bucks.
Not the one I had my eye on.
It looks like we have surpassed last year's pledge total.
Thank you!
And the pledge that did it was taken by one of our volunteers.
Oh, boy! And may I say, one of our sharpest dressed volunteers.
Mr. Joseph Tribbiani!
Oh, look!
Joey's on TV!
Isn't that great?
My pledge got Joey on TV! That makes me feel so...
Oh, no!
Look...
...maybe I got carried away before, but there's something you gotta know.
If I'm the best, it's only because you made me the best.
Keep talking.
I was nothing before you.
Call the other girls and ask.
Which wouldn't take long.
But when I'm with you, and we're together...
...oh, my God!
Really? Oh, my God!
Now, I understand if you never want to sleep with me again.
But that would be wrong.
We're too good.
We owe it to sex!
Well, if we owe it!
Oh, my!
When is Joey gonna be home?
I was kind of hoping we could do this without him.
No, no, no! Leave the gloves on.
But I just cleaned the bathroom.
Yeah, why don't we lose the gloves? Yeah.
All right. Let's show them how it's done.
Okay. Ow!
Y'know that wasn't part of it? I know.
Hi. You ready? We're going to be late.
For what? For Stella, remember?
She's getting her groove back in 20 minutes.
Yeah, I totally forgot about that.
Mind if I take a rain check? I'm waiting for a call from Emily.
Sure, I guess.
Hey, I hear you don't have to go to London. Yay.
It's not that easy. There's still a lot of relationship stuff.
Like what?
Just stuff.
You know, kind of what Emily wants.
Well, Why don't you talk to me about it? Maybe I can help.
No, no, you can't help.
I mean, I kind of have to do this without your help.
Well, I...
I know you can do that too. I'm just saying if you need somebody to talk to...
Hi.
Thanks.
Ross, look, whatever this relationship stuff is that Emily wants...
...just give it to her.
The bottom line is that you love her.
So just fix whatever she wants fixed.
Just do it.
You're going to have to try. You'll just hate yourself if you don't.
Come on, answer it! It's driving me crazy.
Hello?
Hi, sweetie.
Good.
Look. Yes, I've been thinking...
...about that thing you wanted me to do...
...and I can do it.
So will you come to New York?
What?
Never done that before. Nope.
Hey. Hey
Monica?
What time is it?
Uh, 9.
But it's dark out.
Um, well, that's because you always sleep till noon, silly.
This is what 9 looks like.
I guess I'll get washed up then.
Watch that sunrise.
I'm really getting tired of sneaking around all the time.
I know, me too. Hey, Y'know what if we went away for the whole weekend? Y'know we'd have no interruptions
And we could be naked the entire time.
All weekend? That's a whole lot of naked.
Yeah, I could say I have a conference and you can say you have a chef thing.
Oh, I've always wanted to go to this culinary fair in Jersey!
Ha, ha, okay. You know you're not, though.
Right. Okay. Let's go.
Wait. What about Joey?
Friends  S05E05  The One With All the Kips
Hey, guess what I'm doing this weekend.
Going to this culinary fair in Jersey.
How weird! Chandler just told us he's got a conference there.
Oh, that's funny
Seems like Chandler's conference could've been in Connecticut or Vermont.
I'm not in charge of where the conference is held.
Do you want people to think it's a fake conference? It's a real conference.
Hey. Hey.
Is Rachel here? I gotta talk to her.
No, she's out shopping.
Damn. What's going on?
I told Emily to come.
And I just need to, you know, talk to Rachel about it.
Wait a minute.
So when Emily comes, you're just, you're not gonna see Rachel anymore?
Well look, I'm just trying to focus on the "I get to see my wife," part, all right?
And not the part that makes me do this.
Wow, so you guys are, you're never gonna be in the same room together?
How is that even gonna work?
I have no idea.
But-but I assure you I will figure it out.
It doesn't seem like it's gonna work.
Hi, guys. Hi.
Hey. Hey.
What's going on?
We're flipping Monica's mattress.
So I'm thinking, basically, we pick it up, and then we flip it.
That's better than my way.
Oh, hey, guys, would you flip mine too?
Oh, man.
Oh, look! A letter from my mom.
So, Rach?
You know how Emily's coming, right?
Oh, yeah. I know.
Can you hear anything?
Oh, yeah, somebody just said, "Can you hear anything?"
Hey, Joey's ass.
What are you doing?
Well, remember when they got in that big fight and broke up and we were all stuck in her all night with no food or anything?
Well, when Ross said "Rachel" at the wedding, I figured it was gonna happen again.
You know? So I hid this in here.
Ooh, candy bars, crossword puzzles...
Ooh, Mad Libs. Mine!
Condoms?
Hey, you don't know how long we're gonna be in here.
We may have to re-populate the Earth.
And condoms are the way to do that?
Anyway, it all boils down to this.
The last time I talked to Emily... Aah! Oh, my God! Our dog died!
What? Oh, my God. LaPooh, our dog!
LaPooh's still alive?
Oh! It says he was hit by an ice-cream truck
and dragged for 19 blocks!
Oh! Oh, my God.
Sweetie, we heard you crying. Please don't cry.
It's LaPooh!
I know, it's LaPooh right now but it'll get better.
I can't believe it! We're here!
Ooh, chocolates on the pillows! Oh, I love that!
You should live with Joey. Roll-os everywhere.
Oh. Okay, be right back.
Oh, yes!
Monica, get in here. It's a high-speed car chase on!
We're switching rooms.
Oh, dear God, they gave us glasses!
They gave us glasses with lipstick on them.
If they didn't change the glasses, who knows what else they didn't change.
Oh, come on, sweetie. I just want this weekend to be perfect, okay?
We can change rooms, can't we? Okay.
Okay, but let's do it now, though, because Chopper 5 just lost its feed!
Hey, so, uh...
You know how there was something I wanted to talk to you about?
Oh, yeah.
Well...
...you know I'm trying to work things out with Emily.
Well, there's this...
...one thing.
Okay, here goes.
I made a promise that
Oh hey! What? Your nose is bleeding.
Oh, God! You're bleeding.
No! Oh not again! This happened when my grandfather died.
It's... Ugh, sorry.
Oh, gross, unh.
Okay. So I'm sorry. What did you wanna tell me?
Sorry. Sorry.
Okay.
I can't see you anymore.
Yeah, I know, it's ridiculous. I can't see you, either.
I think you'll find this room more to your liking.
Okay, great.
They say he's only got half a tank left.
Half a tank? We still got a lot of high-speed chasing to do!
We're switching rooms again. What? Why?
This is a garden-view room and we paid for an ocean-view room.
Our last ocean-view room was unacceptable to you.
Excuse me. Um, can I talk to you over here for just a second?
Chandler. Yeah?
Look, these clowns are trying to take us for a ride. I won't let them.
We're not a couple of suckers.
I hear you, Mugsy.
But, look, all these rooms are fine.Okay? Can you just pick one so I can watch the...
Have a perfect, magical weekend together with you?
Okay, this one I like. Nothing.
Nothing. It's over.
Damn it, this is regularly scheduled programming!
Can we turn the TV off, okay?
Do we really want to spend the entire weekend like this?
I'm sorry, am I getting in the way of all the room-switching fun?
Ha, ha, don't blame me for ruining tonight.
Who should I blame? The nice bellman who had to drag our luggage to 10 rooms?
I don't know, how about the idiot who thought he could drive...
...from Albany to Canada on a half a tank of gas?
Do not speak ill of the dead.
We're supposed to be spending a romantic weekend together.
it-it, What's the matter with you?
I just wanna watch a little television. What's the big deal?
Jeez, relax, Mom.
What did you say?
I said, "Jeez, relax, Mon."
Hey.
Hey. Rachel, I-I-I've been wanting to tell you something for a while now
and I really, I just have to get it out.
Okay. All right. What's up?
Okay.
You know how you told me I should do whatever it takes to fix my marriage?
Yeah, I told you to give Emily whatever she wants.
And while that was good advice, you should know that what she wants...
Yeah?
...is for me not to see you anymore.
Well, that's crazy. You can't do that.
What are you gonna tell her?
Oh, my God.
Oh, you've already agreed to this, haven't you?
It's awful, I know. Uh, it's.
I mean, I feel terrible, but I have to do this if I want my marriage to work.
And I do. I have to make this marriage work. I have to.
But the good thing is, we can still see each other until she gets here.
Oh, lucky me!
Oh, my God! That is good news, Ross!
I think that's the best news I've heard since LaPooh died!
You have no idea what a nightmare this has been. Uh, this is so hard.
Oh, yeah, really? Is it, Ross?
Well, let me make this a little easier for you.
What are you doing? Storming out.
Rachel, this is your apartment.
Yeah? Well, that's how mad I am!
Damn Rolos!
Hey, you're back. Hey.
How was your conference?
It was terrible. I fought with my colleagues for the entire time.
Are you kidding with this?
Uh, so your weekend was a total bust?
Uh, no, I got to see Donald Trump waiting for an elevator.
Hi. Hey, you're back too.
Yeah. Um, Chandler, could I talk to you outside for a second?
How was your chef thing? Ugh. It was awful.
I guess some people don't appreciate really good food.
Maybe it was the kind of food that tasted good at first...
...but then made everybody vomit and have diarrhea.
Chandler. Monica.
Okay, I'd like to know how much the room was because I'd like to pay my half.
Okay, fine. $300.
Three hundred dollars? Yeah. Just think of it as $25 per room.
What are you guys woofing about?
Chandler stole a 20 from my purse!
No!
You know what? Now that I think about it...
...I constantly find myself without 20s, and you always have lots.
You should've seen the look on her face.
I don't want Rachel to hate me. I don't know what to do.
You want my advice? Yes. Please.
You're not gonna like it. That's okay.
You got married too fast.
That's not advice. I told you.
I'm going to the bathroom.
Man, if anyone asked me to give up any of you, I don't think I could do it.
Me neither.
Maybe I could do it.
Hi. Hey.
I know you guys heard about the whole thing with me and Ross.
But I've been obsessing about it all day and would love not to talk about it.All right?
Uh, I don't know if this falls under that category...
...but, uh, Ross is right back there.
That's not Ross. Oh, no, not that guy.
He does look like him, though.
Okay. Ross is in the bathroom.
Oh, my God. It's happening. It's already started.
I'm Kip.
What? Yeah, you're not Kip.
Do you even know who Kip is?
Who cares? You're Rachel.
Who's Kip?
Kip, my old roommate. We all hung out together.
Oh, that poor bastard.
See? You told me the story.
He and Monica dated when they broke up they couldn't even be in the same room together
You all promised you'd stay his friend.And what happened?
He got phased out.
You're not gonna be phased out.
Well, of course I am.It won't happen to Ross. He's your brother,
your old college roommate.
It was a matter of time before someone had to leave the group. I just always assumed Phoebe would be the one to go.
Honey, come on, you live far away, you're not related.
You lift right out.
Hey.
Hey, Mr. Bing.
That, uh, hotel you stayed at called.
Said someone left an eyelash curler in your room.
Yes, that was mine.
I figured you hooked up with some girl and she left it there.
Yes, that would have made more sense.
You know, I don't even feel like I know you anymore, man.
All right, uh, look, I'm just gonna ask you this one time, all right?
And whatever you say, I'll believe you.
Were you or were you no on a gay cruise?
Phoebe.
I'm sorry about the whole lifting-out thing.
You gotta come with me.
Come where? Wherever I go.
Come on, you and me, we'll start a new group. We're the best ones.
Okay, but try to get Joey too.
Pheebs, do you mind if I speak to Rachel alone for a sec?
Oh, sure, yeah.
Bye, Ross.
Forever.
Hi. Hi.
What are you doing here?
Isn't this against the rules?
I talked to Monica.
Look, I'm the one who made the choice.
I'm the one who's making things change.
So I should be the one to, you know, step back.
Oh, Ross... No, no, it's okay. Really.
Plenty of people just see their sisters at Thanksgiving,and just see their college roommates at reunions
...and just see Joey at Burger King.
So is, is that better?
No, it's not better.
I still don't get to see you.
Well, what would you do, Rach? If you were me, what would you do?
Well...
...for starters, I would have said the right name at my wedding.
I can't believe this is happening.
I know.
I am so sorry.
I know that too.
Ahem. Hey, Rach? Sorry to interrupt
but, uh, Phoebe said you wanted to talk to me about a trip or something.
Hey. Hi.
Hi
I just came over to drop off...
...nothing.
So that weekend kind of sucked, huh?
Yeah, it did.
So I guess this is over?
What? Well, you know, you and me.
I mean, it had to end sometime.
Why exactly?
Because of the weekend. We had a fight.
Chandler, that's crazy.
If you give up every time you have a fight with someone,you'd never be with anyone longer than...
So
this isn't over?
You are so cute!
No, no. It was a fight.
You deal with it and you move on.
It's nothing to freak out about.
Really? Okay, great.
Welcome to an adult relationship.
We're in a relationship?
I'm afraid so. Okay.
Hey. Hey.
Oh, hey, Monica, I heard you saw Donald Trump at your convention.
Yeah, saw him waiting for an elevator.
Rach, can I borrow your eyelash curler? I think I lost mine.
Yeah, it's in the bathroom.
Joey, can I talk to you for a second?
Yes.
Yes.
You? And you?
Yes, but you cannot tell anyone. No one knows.
But how? When?
It happened in London. In London!
The reason we didn't tell anyone was we didn't wanna make a big deal out of it.
But it is a big deal!
I have to tell someone!
No, no, no. You can't.
Please? Please?! We just don't want to deal with telling everyone, okay?
Please, just promise you won't tell.
All right.
Man, this is unbelievable!
I mean, it's great! But...
I know. It's great!
Oh, I don't wanna see that!
We're so stupid.
Do you know what's going on in there?
They're trying to take Joey.
"The most popular Phoebe in tennis is called the overhand Phoebe. Heh.
If you win, you must slap your opponent on the Phoebe and say, 'Hi, Phoebe!"'
Oh, that's cute. We really all enjoyed it.
But you know it doesn't count. Count for what?
Just count in our heads as good Mad Libs.
I guess fun time's over. Yeah, I'm done.
Wait, guys, if we follow the rules,it's still fun and it means something.
I'm gonna take off.
Guys, rules are good!Rules help control the fun.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
None of that. Not while you're living under my roof.
What?
Look, just because I know about you two doesn't mean I like looking at it.
Aren't you supposed to be at an audition for another hour?
Well, I'm sorry if I'm not a middle-aged black woman.
And I'm also sorry if sometimes I go to the wrong audition.
Okay, look, if I have to pretend I don't know about you two,then you two are gonna have to pretend there's nothing to know about.
Okay, sorry.
I can hear that.
Rachel's at work.
I can still hear you.
Friends  S05E06   The One With The Yeti
Hey. Hey.
Hey. What's that?
Yeah, my mom sent me a family heirloom that once belonged to my grandmother.
Can you believe it?
A year ago I didn't even have a family,and now I have heirlooms for crying out loud.
Oh, God!
Oh, soft.
Is this mink?
Yeah! Why would my mother send me a fur?
Doesn't she know me but at all?
Plus, I have a perfectly fine coat that no innocent animals suffered to make.
Yeah, just some 9-year-old Filipino kids who worked their fingers bloody...
...for 12 cents an hour.
That didn't happen, I made that up.
Hey. Ross?
Ross, you can't put up flyers in here.
How come? Everybody else does.
You can't.
What is that?
Oh, uh, I'm getting rid of a couple of things.
This is all of your things.
Yes, yes, it is.
No, but it's good. Emily thinks we should get all new stuff.
Stuff that's just ours. Together, you know, brand new.
So basically this is a "getting rid of anything Rachel ever touched" sale.
Touched, used, sat on, slept on...
I'll take it all.
Hey, Ross, you're okay with that?
Look, if I can just do what Emily wants,and get her to New York, I'm sure everything will be fine.
Okay, but don't you think that's a little extreme?
After what I did, can you blame her?
Oh, my God. You got off easy.
When my friend Sylvie's husband said someone else's name in bed,she cursed him and turned his thingy green.
What is he doing?
Emily thinks Ross' furniture has got Rachel cooties?
Calm down, Joey. No.
Everything's getting all messed up, you know?
Emily won't let Ross see Rachel.
We're not gonna stop seeing Rachel, hence, Ross stops seeing us.
Oh, I hate this. Everything's changing.
Yeah, I know. We're losing Ross, Joey said "hence."
I'm not happy about this either,
but, you know, if Ross says he's happy...
...then we just have to keep our feelings about Emily to ourselves.
Are you cool with that?
No.
But, you know, I'm an actor.
I'll act cool.
Ooh. Oh, God, storage rooms give me the creeps.
Monica, please, hurry up, honey, please.
Rachel, if you want the little round waffles, you gotta have to wait until I find the little waffle iron.
I want the little round waffles. All right.
Here it is.
Right underneath the can of bug bomb.
I wonder if the best place to put something that cooks food is underneath the can of poison?
Okay, you know what? I'll have toast.
Oh my God! Fog him! Fog him!
I don't know what I'm gonna do about this coat.
I'll take it.
That might work. Oh, yeah
Huh? All right, what do you think?
You're on in five, Ms. Minnelli.
No, no, no, it's just a bit sudden.
No, it's great, okay? I am totally on board.
I love you too. All right, bye.
What's the matter, Ross?
Nothing. Oh, actually, great news!
Um, just got off the phone with Emily,and looks like I'm moving to a new apartment.
Why? Well, her thought is... And I agree.
Fresh new furniture, why not a fresh new apartment?
Her cousin has this great place to sublet.
It's got a view of the river on one side and Columbia on the other.
That's way uptown. That's like three trains away...
...which is great.
I love to ride that rail.
So you're really okay with this?
Yes, yes. I mean, it's kind of far from work...
...but, uh, you know, I'll get so much done on the commute.
I've been given the gift of time.
That's so funny, because last Christmas I got the gift of space.
We should get them together and make a continuum.
Now he's moving?
Man, what is Emily doing to him? Ow!
He's not even here.
You guys. You guys.
We were just in the storage area and we saw this really creepy man.
He was like this crazy-eyed, hairy beast-man.
He was like a Bigfoot or a yeti or something.
He came at us with an ax, so Rachel had to use the bug bomb on him.
Yeah, I pulled the tab and I just fogged his yeti ass.
Uh, like, dark hair, bushy beard? Yeah.
Yeah, you fogged Danny.
Ugh, please. We did not fog Danny.
Who's Danny?
Danny just moved in downstairs.
He just got back from this four-month trek in the Andes. Nice fella.
Oh, he's nice. He's nice. You know, you always stick up for the people we fog.
Yeah? Hi.
You might not remember us, but we are the girls that fogged you.
We're really sorry we fogged you.
Okay.
Hi, uh, just so you know, we didn't mean to fog you.
We actually thought you were like a yeti or something.
Okay.
Yes?
Hi. Ahem, sorry to bother you...
...but I don't think that we can accept your acceptance of our apology.
It just doesn't really seem like you mean it.
Yeah
Okay.
Wow. That guy is so rude.
Really. What is with that guy?
I mean, you'd forgive me if I fogged you.
Well, you did, a little bit.
Oh, my God, honey. I'm so sorry.
I totally forgive you.
Really?
Hey. Hey.
So listen, you know my friend Chris who owns the crematorium?
Crematorium Chris? Sure.
Well, he said that he would cremate my fur coat for free...
...if I, um, you know, bring in the next person I know who dies.
Oh, my God.Oh, my God. Look at these pelts.
Don't get too attached. She's having it cremated.
What...?
Phoebe? Ha. Honey?
Honey, I know you're quirky, and I get a big kick out of it. We all do, actually.
But if you destroy a coat like this,I mean, that is like a crime against nature.
Not nature. Fashion.
This is fashion?
Okay, so to you, death is fashion?
That's really funny.
Here's Phoebe umm, sporting uh, y'know, cutting edge hairy carcass
...from, you know, the steel traps of wintry Russia.
I mean, you really think this looks good?
Because I do.
I know, I miss you too. I can't wait to see you.
I love you. Bye.
Okay, what is in here, rocks?
No, this is my collection of, uh, fossil samples.
So rocks.
I'm really gonna miss this apartment. Heh.
You know, Ben took his first steps right over there.
Hey, remember when I ran into this thing and it kind of knocked me out a little?
I love this place.
To tell you the truth, I wish I didn't have to move.
Uh, are you saying that you're not entirely happy about this?
Well, I mean, if, uh, Emily gave me a choice. You do have a choice.
Ross, why are you listening to her? Are you crazy?
What?
It's not right what Emily wants you to do
She is totally
Stop pinching me.
You guys said I only had to keep my mouth shut as long as Ross was happy, right?
Well, he just told me that he's not entirely happy.
What's going on?
We all hate Emily.
No. No, Ross, we do not hate Emily.
We just think that you're having to sacrifice a whole lot to make her happy.
Yeah.
We just think that maybe she's being a little unreasonable.
Yes, yes, unreasonable.
Unreasonable?
How about we have this conversation when one of you guys gets married?
You have no idea what it takes to make a marriage work.
It's about compromise. Do you always like it? No.
Do you do it? Yes.
Because it's not all laughing, happy, candy in the sky,drinking coffee at Central Perk all the time
It's real life, okay?
It's what grownups do.
I think he's right.
You guys hang out at the coffeehouse way too much.
God, I feel so guilty about Ross.
I know.
I kind of feel like it's my fault.
Kind of?
If you just kept this to yourself, none of this would have happened.
Well, I'm keeping so many things to myself these days,something was bound to slip out.
Well, I think it's very brave what you said.
I can't sit here anymore. I have to walk places.
Pheebs, what are you doing with the coat? How about the whole animal rights thing?
Well, ahem, I've been reading up, and for your information...
...minks are not very nice.
Okay, I admit it. I love this coat, okay?
It's the best thing I've ever had wrapped around me, including Phil Huntley.
Remember Phil Huntley? He was fine.
Hi.
So you like the short hair better?
What?
Yeti? Uh, Danny?
I had to cut my hair to get rid of the,fogger smell.
Listen, I'm so sorry. I would have never fogged you...
...you know, if you hadn't looked so... You know, um...
Absolutely.
Some people are just into appearances.
What? That's cool. That's cool.
What...? Hey, whoa, no, no, no, that is not cool.You don't even know me.
Come on. You got the shopping bags and the Saks catalogue.
So from that, you think you've got me all figured out?
Well, you don't.
You know, I could have toys for underprivileged kids in here.
Do you?
Well, you know, if kids like to play with capri pants.
Okay.
And stop saying that. I hate that.
Okay.
Fine! I judged you.
I made a snap judgement. But you did it too!
and you're worse...
...because you are sticking to your stupid snap judgment.
You can't even open up your mind for a second to see that you might be wrong.What does that say about you?
That pizza place across the street any good?
What? I'm hungry. You wanna get some pizza?
You can keep yelling if there's more.
Okay.
Okay. Stop saying that. I hate that.
Uh, Ross?
Are you still mad at us? Yup.
Oh, good, because we have an "I'm Sorry" song. Ha, ha.
You know what? I'm really not in the mood.
Look, Ross.I feel really bad.
I mean, you're going through all this stuff,and I just acted like a jerk.
Yeah, we are so sorry.
You're stepping on the song.
Look, we were way out of line, all right? We totally support you.
Whatever you decide, whatever you do.
Okay, now you're just taking lines right out of the song.
Look, this is hard enough, okay?
I really need you guys right now.
Yes, exactly. And that's why...
Why don't you come over tonight, and I'll make you your favorite dinner? Come on.
Okay.
Thanks, you guys.
Pheebs, are you wearing fur?
Okay, let's get some perspective, people.It's not like I'm wearing a seeing-eye dog coat.
You know, Ross, I, uh, think I kind of understand why I lost it today.
You do, huh?
Yeah, you see, um...I'm an actor, right?
So I gotta keep my emotions right at the surface, you know?
I got a lot of balls in the air, you know what I mean?
It's tough. Guys like me, you know, you wander around, you're alone.
What are you talking about?
I'm not sure.
Hi. Hey, look at you. Where have you been?
Oh, I went to have pizza. With Danny.
How did that happen?
That yeti is one smooth talker.
I hope you're not too full, because dinner's almost ready.
Yeah, you know, I think I'm probably just gonna hang out in my room.
Oh, no. Why?
Come on, you guys.
Listen, if Emily knew I was here having dinner with you,
she would flip out, and you know it.
It's okay. I really... I don't mind.
Wait, wait, wait. You know what? Just stay.
Please.
It would really mean a lot for me if you stay.
Ross, I just...Rachel, please, just have dinner with us.
Okay, Joey, it's okay. Settle down.All right. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
You see, Rach, I'm an actor.
Hey. Hey, look. Ugly naked guy's back.
We haven't seen him in so long.
Oh, God. I really missed that fat bastard.
Wow. This is so weird.
I just realized this may be the last time we're all hanging out together.
It's almost as if he knew.
I'll get it.
Hello?
Hi, Emily.
Yeah, uh, you tracked him down. Hold on one second.
Hey.
Yeah, yeah, we're, uh, just having dinner.
Uh, yeah, sure, hold on.She wants to say hi.
Hold on.
Hi, Emily.
Hello, everyone.
So who am I saying hello to?
Well, uh, I don't know about who's here,but I can tell you for damn sure who's not here, and that's Rachel.
Well, I should hope not.
Ross knows better than that by now.
You know what? Uh, Rachel is here.
She's there?
Oh, yeah, there she is.
Yeah. Yeah, she's here.
Ross, take me off speakerphone.
Hi. How could you do this to me?
I thought I'd made my feelings about Rachel perfectly clear.
Look, Emily, I'm just having dinner with my friends, okay?
You obviously can't keep away from her.
That's ridiculous.
Look, I'm moving for you.
I'm cutting friends out of my life for you.
Please, just get on the plane and come to New York, okay?
You'll see you're the only person I want to be with.
I'll feel better when I'm there
and I can know where you are all the time.
Well, you can't know where I am all the time.
Look, this marriage is never gonna work if you don't trust me.
You're right.
So... can you trust me?
No.
I think it's going okay.
Looks like he's smiling.
How can you tell? You can only see the back of his head.
You can totally tell.
Here, look, watch me.
Smile. Frown. Smile. Frown.
Smile.
Well, I guess that's it.
Why? What happened?
My marriage is over.What?
Oh, sweetie.
Oh, look at you, you're shivering.
Here.
Ross, honey, is there anything we can do?
Yeah.You can help me get my furniture back from Gunther.
Okay, stop tormenting me.
This is mink, okay? They're mean,
and they hate squirrels.
And, you know, most of these probably wanted to be coats.
All right, fine. No, I get it.
Here.
You take it.
Are you happy now? I'm cold.
Are you looking at naked tribeswomen?
No, look.
That's a pig.
I know, I know, But look at the knobs on it!
Hey. Hey.
Emily's cousin kicked me out.
What? Why?
when you're subletting an apartment from your wife's cousin
and then you get a divorce
sometimes the cousin suddenly wants his apartment back.
How can he do that?Didn't you sign a lease?
Who needs a lease when it's "family"?
Hey, You can stay with us.
We'll take care of ya! Oh, yeah! Absolutely!
Anything you need man!
But you have to promise me the second you are feeling better
so that we can make fun of your hair!
You got it. Okay.
Thanks, I really appreciate this.
All right,I'm going to get packing again.Man
I've been moving around so much that I feel like a nomad.
What? He thought you said gonad.
Friends  S05E07  The One Where Ross Moves In
Wow, Monica. if every restaurant is as clean as yours,
I'd have a tough time making a living.
Ha, oh, Larry!
Um, do health inspectors work on commission?
No, bribes.
Ha-ha-ha, it's okay to laugh?
I was just kidding.
I'll check the kitchen floor.
Knock yourself out.
Yummy! Heh.
Larry? Yeah, I'd let him check out my kitchen floor.
A 98.
I deducted 2 points because you are not wearing your chef's hat,
That is a Section 5 violation.
Oh. Now look, Larry, honey, ha, ha.
Um, I wrote the book on Section 5.
I know that you don't have to wear your hat unless you're in the kitchen.
Where's your hat? In the kitchen. I'll get it.
Ah, there's the two points!
You should really read that book you wrote.
You saw the hat in the kitchen
and knew that she'd have to go in there hatless to get it.
You could have your own health inspector detective show.
Ah, I don't know about that.
But then I could be your sidekick, Voonda, heh.
Maybe uh, Vunda could give me her number and I can ask her to dinner sometime.
She would love that...Y'know
...since you know all the clean places to eat, heh.
I'll call you.
He's so funny! Whoa, oh.
Thank you. Thanks.
How's Ross doing since all the Emily stuff?
He's not great. .
But, um, he's dealing with it
Oh. Wait, you're not...
Oh, I can't get started with all that Ross stuff again
I mean, he's gonna screwed up for a looong time.
Besides, I don't go for guys right after they get divorced.
Right, you only go for them five minutes before they get married.
Two pounds of mocha java.
It's Danny. Are you guys ever gonna go out again?
I don't know.
He hasn't called me since that one time when we went out.
I see him in the hallway. We flirt.
I'm all...and then nothing.
Hey. Hi, Danny.
Wow, thirsty, huh?
ctually, actually, I'm having a party at my place on Saturday, it's sort of a house warming kind of thing.
Oh, fun. Oh, great!
I'm really looking forward to it. Yeah.
Okay, See you!
Well, I guess we won't be warming his house.
Okay. All right, I see what he's doing!
He's not asking me out because he wants me to ask him out.
And you won't do that. That's right!
Cause that would give him the control.
So now he's all ooh, coming up with this whole I've got a party thing y'know.
trying to get me to hint around for an invitation.
Blew up in his face, didn't it? Ha.
So there is no party?
No, there's a party. There's a party.
But the power?that is still up for grabs.
You follow me?
I think so.
So he's not inviting you to his party because he likes you?
Exactly!
Ross?
Hey, roomies!
I love what you've done with the place.
Oh, I know it's a lot of boxes.
but again I really appreciate you guys letting me stay here.Not a problem.
And listen, hey! Since you're gonna be here for a while, .
why don't―I was thinking we uh, put your name on the answering machine.
Oh, I, uh, hope you don't mind...
...but I kind of already jazzed it up a little, ha, ha.
Check it out.
We will We will call you back
Pretty cool, huh?-Oh, yes.
You're fake laughing too, right?
The tears are real..
You look beautiful this evening. Heh.
Show me the badge again.
Shiny, ha, ha.
Oh, you mind if I wash up? Because I came straight from work .
and who knows where these babies have been
You are just nonstop, ha-ha-ha!
We're out of here. Why?
Just walking past the kitchen I saw 10 violations!
I'm shutting this place down!
You have the power to do that?.
This does
Shut it down.
Hey.
What are you doing?
Nothing.
You built a fort, didn't you?
Kind of, heh.
Oh, my God! The air purifier. Ross' air purifier.
All I heard for four years through college was...
You should have gone out once in a while.
I hate this thing!
Come on, Chandler. Ross is our friend.
He needs us right now.
So why don't you be a grownup and come watch TV in the fort?
Oh, hi, Danny.
Hey, guys. I just uh, wanted to invite you to the party tomorrow night
Oh, thanks, I'll try to stop by.
Uh, Actually, I think, ahem, I'm going to be busy.
You are?
Yeah.Remember? I've got that, uh, gala.
What's the gala for?
It's, uh, a regatta gala.
Really! You-you sail?
No-no, but I support it.
Okay, hope I see you tomorrow night. Okay.
Take care. Okay.
Walked right into that one didn't he?
What one?
You wanted him to invite you to the party and he did it!
He waited until the last minute.
So if I said yes, he would know I had nothing better to do than wait around for an invitation to his stupid party.
I said, "No!" Which puts me right back in the driver seat.
Great. So the ball is in his court?
Ball? No, there's no ball.
Joey, please.
Sorry.
Hello, children. Hey.
You want to play some foosball? Please?
Okay. No, no, no.
We moved the table into my room
because of all the boxes, ha, ha.Come on!
All right, I have one question.
What is the deal with this?
Bye-bye, little puppet Joey hand?
No, the quiet down thing.
Oh. You mean this.
I don't know how much more I can take.
Did you know he taped over my Baywatch tape with a show about bugs?
My God! What if that had been porn? Oh!
All right look, y'know, this may be tough...
come on...but it's Ross. I survived college with him.
Right,I guess I can hold out a little longer.
Let's have a game. Okay.
Don't be scored on. No, no, no.
Uh, fellas?
Okay, so he's out of here.
Hey. Hey.
You guys got anything to eat?
I just went down to Johnos for some chicken and it was closed!
Oh, I took Larry there, but it was all violated, so we shut it down.
Pheebs, if this guy keeps closing down all of our favorite places,
where will we eat?
I don't know. Clean places?
It's Danny.
Don't let him in! I'm supposed to be at a regatta gala.
We'll be right there.
Can't you say it's later?
What kind of a regatta gala starts at night?
The fake kind.
Um, I need a ladle. You got a ladle?
We have a ladle.
Thanks, see you at the party. Okay, great.
Hey, guys, you know what Larry would say?
He'd say, "See you ladle"
Well, I-I-I'm done with this. You want anything Ross? Sports? International? Apartment listings?
I'll take sports. Mine!
All right, uh, international.That's mine too.
I'm Italian.
Well, I guess I can check out those apartment listings, even though there's never anything in here.
Not even on page seven?
Oh, yeah. you're right!
Oh, here's an affordable place. Two bedroom, close to work..
Ooh, it's available in five weeks
What about that circled one?
Ooh, I don't know. It's kind of expensive for a studio.
But it's available now.
Isn't it?
Yes, it is.
Let's go look at it, heh!
Oh, okay. Let's go. There we go! Yay!
Oh-oh-ooh, hey guys, I was wondering if you guys would uh,
maybe chip in on some new air filters for the air purifier?
I mean, after all, we are all using it.
Let's go quicker!
Oh, my God! Mm.
Oh, look at this kitchen, slash bathroom.
Well that's great! Y'know so you can cook while in the tub.
Somebody was using his head.
Let's check out the rest of the place.
I think this is it.
I don't know. Maybe we should keep looking.
But hey, Ross, this place is available now!
Yeah, you don't want to be stuck with us for five weeks.
So you think I should go ahead take this place?
Oh, it's perfect!
How about you?
Kitchen, slash, bathroom.
Ah, I see what you guys are saying.
I'll, uh, go downstairs and fill out an application.
We are bad people.
He knew we were trying to get rid of him.
He knew!
Could we get a bathtub in our kitchen?
Hey, ready for dinner?
Ooh, absolutely. Great.
You wanted to go to the Italian place on Bleecker St?
Oh, I love that place, ha, ha.
So no. Oh.
How about Mama Lozetti's? Enh.
Sure!
I wonder how long has that milk been sitting out?
Oh, no-no, this place is totally healthy.
That—this milk is mine.
I bought this today, 'cause I was thirsty for milk, y'know.
Okay, let's go.
Hey, buddy.
Health Code 11-B of the Health Code that requires all refuse material out the back exit?
But then I'd have to go all the way around the dry cleaner place.
Oh, so you're saying you'd choose convenience over health?!
Okay, stop! Larry,
okay, can't you just be Larry and not Larry the health inspector guy?
Y'know I mean it was really exciting at first
But now, it's like, okay, so where are we going to eat ever?
Well, I suppose I could give him a warning.
Thank you.
Go, go!
Now, If, after dinner, you still need to bust someone...
...I know a hot dog vendor who picks his nose.
Maybe we did a good thing, helping Ross get back on his feet.
Yes, That was a nice place.Yeah!
No closet space, but he could hang his stuff out the window in a bag.
What are we gonna do?
I don't know.
Maybe pizza?
About Ross! Oh.
Hello.
Oh, yeah.It's the apartment manager. Ross put us as references.
Ross is the greatest guy you'll ever meet!  He's very reliable...
Of course, he has a big, huge dog
that, uh, barks into the night.
Well, who doesn't love dogs?
Uh, he's a tap dancer.
Yes, some would say that is a lost art.
He's a pimp!
There you go. Yes, He's a pimp.
He's a big, tap-dancing pimp!
Hello?
Shh, this is never going to work. He's right there.
Just go say hi.
I have to go downstairs and come back up, as if I'm coming home from the gala.
So just go distract him. But don't be sexy.
Hey, Danny. Hey.
This is a great party. Great food, ha, ha.
Oh, you know, most parties, it's, uh, all chips and salsa, chips and salsa.
So, um...
What's this?
Salad. Ooooh!
And what's this?
Bread.
Aren't you a chef?
Hey, Rachel. Hey.
Oh, right, tonight was your party.
You look great! I'm glad you made it.
Oh, well, you know, the gala had to end sometime.
Don't go anywhere. I'll be right back.
Yeah, sure. All right?
All right.Whose court is the ball in now?
I thought there wasn't a ball.
Come on. He's glad that I came. He doesn't want me to go anywhere.
Ball's flying all over the place.
This is my friend, Tom.
This is the girl I told you about.
Oh, come on! You telling people about me?
You two could really hit it off!
I'm gonna go mingle.
So you work at Bloomingdale's, huh?
My mom calls it "Bloomies."
Yeah, okay.At ease, soldier, heh.
I'm sorry?
No, it's all right, you can just drop the act Tommy. I know what's going on here. .
You're Danny's wingman, right?
You guys are best buds, frat bros.
I'm going to go talk to, uh, a friend.
Yeah, you go talk to your friend.
Go tell him, "Nice try."
Man! y'know, He just keeps lobbing them up and I just keep knocking them right out of the park!.
I think I need a drink. Yeah!
Ninety-eight...ninety-nine..one hundred!
Okay. Go.
Dude, I'm telling you, I'm fine.
Here we go, here we go.
Hey. Hey.
So I, uh, I didn't get that apartment.
Some problem with my application.
You're kidding? You're kidding, no!
But, the good news is that Phoebe said I could stay at her place for a while, so...
But you can't stay with Phoebe, Ross! We're-we're roomies!
Look, you guys don't need me here taking up your space.
We got plenty of space.
There's still some over there by that speaker.
Please, just stay.
Are you guys sure about this? Definitely!.
Yes! Ross, you have to stay!
All right. All right, buddy.
So I'm a pimp, huh?
It's okay.
Look, I know that sometimes I can be a pain in the ass. But you just have to talk to me.
Tell me if something bothers you.Okay?
And for my part I will do everything I can to keep my annoying habits just
Well, I see you've had a very productive day.
The cowboy hat's a little much.
Come on, it's fun!
All right.
Isn't this a woman's hat?
Dude, stop talking crazy, and make us some tea!
Monica, that was the best Thanksgiving dinner ever.
It was so good. I think you killed us.
I couldn't possibly eat another bite.
I need something sweet.
Does anyone wanna watch TV? Yeah. Sure.
Monica, your remote doesn't work.
Phoebe, you have to lift it and point.
Oh.
forget it.
Hey, you know what we should all do?
We should play that game where everyone says one thing they're thankful for.
Oh, I... I am thankful for this beautiful fall we've been having.
Very nice. Sweet, Joe.
Yeah, the other day, I was at the bus stop...
...and this lovely fall breeze came in out of nowhere...
...and blew this chick's skirt right up.
Oh, which reminds me, I'm also thankful for thongs.
Friends  S05E08 The One With The Thanksgiving Flashbacks
It's not so much an underpant as it is a feat of engineering.
It's amazing how much they can do with so little material.
And the way they play with your mind. I mean, is it there? Is it not there?
Are you aware that you're still talking?
Is anyone thankful for anything else besides a thong?
I don't know what to pick. Am I more thankful for my divorce, or my eviction?
Wow, see, and I didn't think you'd be able to come up with anything.
I'm sorry. It's just this is the worst Thanksgiving ever.
No, no, no. I am the king of bad Thanksgivings.
You can't just swoop in here with your bad marriage...and take that away from me.
You're not gonna tell the whole story  about how your parents got divorced, are you?
Come on. I want to hear it.
It wouldn't be Thanksgiving without Chandler bumming us out.
It's a tradition, like the parade.
If the parade decided it was gay, moved out and abandoned its entire family.
Now, Chandler, dear.
Just because your father and I are getting a divorce...
...doesn't mean we don't love you.
It just means he would rather sleep with the houseboy than with me.
More turkey, Mr. Chandler?
You're right, yours is worse. You are the king of bad Thanksgivings.
I don't know about that. I've got one that's worse.
Really? Worse than:"More turkey, Mr. Chandler?"
Did the little rich boy had a problem with the butler? Yes, mine's worse.
More bandages! More bandages!
Please, can I get some more bandages in here? This man is... Aah!
Oh, no.
In this life, Phoebe.
Oh, this life.Oh, okay. No, Chandler's is worse.
Man, it must be so cool remembering stuff like that.
I don't have any past life memories.
Of course, you don't, sweetie. You're brand-new.
I know Monica's worst Thanksgiving.
Oh, let's not tell this story. Oh, come on.
Oh, no! I know! I know!
It's the one where Joey got Monica's turkey stuck on his head.
What? What? Joey got a turkey stuck on his head?
Hey, it's not like it sounds. It's exactly like it sounds.
Hello?
Hello?
Phoebe?
Joey? What's going on?
Oh, my God. I know.It's stuck.
Step. How did it get on?
I put it on to scare Chandler.
Oh, my God. Monica's going to totally freak out.
Well, then help me get it off.
Plus, it smells really bad in here.
Of course it smells really bad. You have your head up a dead animal.
Hey, did you get the turkey...? Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Who is that? It's Joey.
What are you doing? Is this supposed to be funny?
No, it's not supposed to be funny. It's supposed to be scary.
Get that off now.
I can't. It's stuck.
Well, I don't care. That turkey has to feed 20 people.
They're not going to eat it off your head.
Hold on, okay? Let's just all think.
Okay, I got it. Phoebe?
All right. You pull.
I'm gonna spread the legs as wide as I can.
Joey, now is not the time. Yeah. Sorry. Right, sorry.
Okay, count to three. One, two...three.
It worked. I scared you. I knew it. Ha, ha!
I'm over here, big guy.
Yeah, you are. Ha, ha!
I scared you. Whoo!
You did look like an idiot.
Hey, I wasn't the only one who looked like an idiot, all right?
Remember when Ross tried to say "butternut squash"...
...and it came out, "squatternut bosh"?
Yeah, that's the same.
That's it. That's my worst Thanksgiving.
Oh, wait. That can't be the one that Rachel was talking about...
...because she didn't even know that that happened.
So, what's yours? What was it?
Um, I really don't wanna tell this story.
Oh, come on, Monica.
Reliving past pain and getting depressed is what Thanksgiving's all about.
You know, for me, anyway. And, of course, the Indians.
Look, of all people, you do not want me to tell this story.
What is that supposed to mean?
Monica, I think Rachel's here.
I'll get it.
Happy Thanksgiving.
Not for me.Chip and I broke up.
Oh. Why? Well, what happened?
You know how my parents are out of town, and Chip was gonna come over?
Yeah, yeah. And you were gonna give him, you know...your "flower."
Okay, Monica, can you just call it sex?
It really creeps me out when you call it that.
Okay, and by the way...
...while we're at it, a guy's thing is not called his "tenderness."
Believe me.
Hi.Hi, Rachel.
Happy Thanksgiving. You too, sweetheart.
Uh, everyone...this is Chandler.
My roommate and lead singer of our band. Heh.
Ross?
Oh. This is Monica.Hi, I'm Ross' little sister.
Okay.
I'm so glad you could come, Chandler.
We've got plenty of food, so I hope you're hungry.
Oh, Mom, no, no, Chandler hates Thanksgiving and doesn't eat any Thanksgiving food.
Oh. Well, I'm so glad you brought him here, then.
Hey, Chandler, If you want, I can make you some macaroni and cheese for dinner.
As long as the Pilgrims didn't eat it, then I'm in.
Damn it.
So, uh, Rach...
Does it...? Does it feel weird around here now?
You know, since I've been away at college?
Oh.No, not really. That's cool.
So...
Ugh! I cannot believe Chip dumped me for that slut, Nancy Branson.
I am never going out with him again.
I don't care how much he begs.
I think his begging days are over, now that he's with Nancy Branson.
You know what? I've just had it with high-school boys.
They're just silly.They're just silly, stupid boys.
I'm gonna start dating men.
Uh, I'm sorry, Judy.I couldn't find that bowl you and Jack were looking for.
Call them Mom and Dad, you loser.
Monica.
Hey, Chandler?
Did you like the macaroni and cheese?
Oh, yeah. It was great. You should be a chef.
Okay.
Guess what. All this stuff about Nancy Branson being a slut was all a rumor.
Chip dumped her, and he wants to come over to my house tonight.
Oh, that is so great. I know.
Oh, gosh. Listen, if you and Chip do it tonight...
...um, promise me you'll tell me everything?
Oh, totally, totally. It's not that big a deal. We already kind of did it once, you know.
I know, but this time you're gonna definitely know whether or not you did it.I know.
Oh, and Chip promised that this time it would last at least for an entire song.
So I'm thinking of asking Rachel out tonight.
You know, maybe playing her that song we wrote last week.
"Emotional Knapsack"?
Yes. Right on.
Oh, uh, but don't take long, okay?
Because we're testing our fake ID's tonight.
Right, Clifford Alvarez?
Listen, Roland Cheng...
...if things go well, I may be out with her all night.
Dude, don't do that to me.
Oh, no. It's cool, you can stay here. My parents won't mind.
It's not that. I don't wanna be stuck here all night with your fat sister.
Monica, why don't you finish off these pies?
I don't have any more room in the fridge.
No.No, thank you.
Well, Judy, you did it. She's finally full.
I called you fat? I don't even remember that.
Well, I do.
I'm so sorry. I really am. But, come on, I was an idiot back then.
I rushed the stage at a Wham! Concert, for crying out loud.
Oh, I can't believe you called her fat.
I can't believe you let George Michael slap you.
I am really sorry.That is so terrible. I'm so, so sorry.
Actually, that's not the Thanksgiving I was talking about.
Yes, it was. No, it wasn't. It was actually...
Ok. Thanksgiving's over. Get ready for Christmas.
Who wants to get a Christmas tree?
Oh, no. I have the cutest Christmas story.
We wanna hear Monica's Thanksgiving story.
Fine, all right. Mine had a dwarf that got broke in half.But, you know, whatever.
So, Rachel, your mom tells me you changed your major again?
Oh, yeah, I had to.There was never any parking by the Psychology building.
Hi, Rachel. Oh, hi.
Wow. Love your new nose. Jack.
What? Dr. Wolfson's an artist.
He removed my mole cluster.Want to see?
No, God. Please, let me.
Happy Thanksgiving. Hi.
God, your hair sure is different.
Yeah, we were just talking about that.
Can't we can't believe how stupid we used to look.
So, uh, where's Monica?
She's upstairs. Monica. Come down, everyone's here.
Ross, Rachel and the boy who hates Thanksgiving.
Hi, Chandler.Oh, my God.
What's the matter? Is there something on my dress?
You just... You look so different. Terrific.
That dress, that body...
Dude. Sorry.
Yes, yes, Monica is thin. It's wonderful.
But what we really want to hear about is Ross' new girlfriend.Oh, Mom...
Okay. Um, ahem, her name is Carol...
...and she's really pretty and smart.
And, uh, she's on the lacrosse team and the golf team.Can you believe it?
She plays for both teams.
So, Chandler, I guess I'll see you at dinner.
Dude. Sorry.
Oh, my God.
That was so awesome.
You totally got him back for calling you fat.
He was just drooling all over you.
That must have felt so great.
Well, it didn't. What?
Yeah, I mean, I look great.
And yeah, I feel great, and, yeah, my heart's not in trouble anymore.
I just don't feel like I got him back, you know?
I mean, I just want to humiliate him.
I want him to be, like, naked...
...and I want to point at him and I wanna laugh.
Okay. That, we may be able to do.
How?
Well, guys tend to get naked before they're gonna have sex.
What? I mean, I didn't work this hard and lose all this weight...
...just so I could give my flower to someone like him.
Okay, first of all, if you keep calling it that, no one is ever gonna take it.
And then second of all, you're not gonna actually have sex with him.
You're just gonna make him think that you are.
Yeah. Yeah.
And then when he's naked...
...I can throw him out, lock the door...
...and all our neighbors will just humiliate him.
And then you will definitely get him back.
Okay, so how do I make him think I want to have sex with him?
Uh, Oh! Here's what you do.
Just act like everything around you turns you on.
What do you mean? Well, like, anything can be sexy.
Like, um... Oh, okay. Like this dish towel.
This feels so good against my cheek.
And if I get a little hot, I can just dab myself with it.
Or I can bring it down to my side and maybe run it through my fingers while I talk to him.
I can do that. Okay, good, good, good.
Get busy. He's coming. He's coming.
Hey, what's up? Hey.
Monica. I was wondering if you could make me some mac and cheese like last year?
I'd love to.
Ooh.I love macaroni and cheese.
I love the way this box feels against my cheek.
Okay. Ooh, and I love carrots.
Sometimes I like to put them between my fingers.
Like this. And hold them down here while I talk to you.
Um, and, you know, if I get really hot...
...um, I like to pick up this knife. And, um, I put the cool steel against
...my body.
Are you all right?
I'm fine.
What do got? Twenty-year-old male.
He's got a severed toe on his right foot.
Could you please not do that feet first?
You know where his injury is. Severed toe, you just said it!
It says here the knife went right through your shoe.
Of course it did. They're made of wicker.
Did you bring the toe? Oh, yes.
I have it right here on ice.
Don't worry, son. We'll just reattach it and then...
What is it?
You brought a carrot.
What? This isn't your toe.
This is a small, very cold piece of carrot.
You brought a carrot?
Oh, my God.There's a toe in my kitchen.
God, I'm sorry. I'll go back and get it.
It's too late. All we can do is sew up the wound.
Without my toe? I need my toe. Okay.
No, no, no. I can go really fast. Dad, give me the keys to your Porsche.
Oh, I'm not falling for that one.
That's why I lost my toe? Because I called you fat?
I didn't mean to cut it off. It was an accident.
That's why for an entire year people called me Sir Limps-a-lot?
I'm sorry. It wasn't your whole toe.
Yeah, well, I miss the tip.It's the best part.
It has the nail.
Chandler...
Sir Limps-a-lot.I came up with that.
You're a dork.
I can't believe this.
Chandler, I said I was sorry.
Yeah, well, "sorry" doesn't bring back the little piggy that cried all the way home.
I hate this stupid day and everything about it.
I'll see you later. Wait, Chandler.Come here.
Is there anything I can do? Anything?
Yeah, just leave me alone for a little while.
Oh, I'm a duck. I go quack-quack. I'm happy all the time.
Nice try.Wait, wait, wait.
Look, Monica... Look.
This is not gonna work.
I bet this will work.
You're so great. I love you.
What?
Nothing. I said you're so great, and then I just stopped talking.
You said you loved me. I can't believe this.
No, I didn't.
Yes, you did. No, I didn't.
You love me. No, I don't.
Stop it, stop it, stop it.
Gauze! Gauze! I need to get some gauze in here!
Can I please get some more gauze?
This is getting ridiculous.
What am I sitting on?
Top of the world? Dock of the bay?
I'm out.
Oh, ew, undies! Oh.
All right, whose are they?
Whose are they?
Not mine.
Joey's. Got to be Joey's.
They're mine.
See, Joey's. They're Joe-Joe-Joey's.
Why are they here?
I don't know, uh...
I'm Joey.
I'm disgusting.I take my underwear off in other people's homes.
Get them out of here. What's wrong with you?
Yeah. Yeah.
Take them! I got them.
Joey, You can touch them. They're your underwear.
Chandler? A word? Yeah.
That's it! I'm tired of covering for you two. .
This has got to stop. Aah
Ahh! And tighty-whiteys!
What are you, 8?
Thank you, Joey, so much.
You're not welcome, okay?
Look, I hate this.
You guys keep embarrassing me.
Yesterday, Rachel found your razor in our bathroom.
and I didn't know what to say,
so I said it was mine
and-and that I was playing a woman in a play.
Then one thing led to another and...
And around the ankles, that is a tough spot.
Yeah, It was. All right, listen...
All this lying has been hard on us too.
Yeah, I bet all the sex makes it easier.
Yeah, actually.
We'll be more careful.
we don't want everyone to know because this is going really well
and maybe the reason it's going really well is because it's a secret..
I know it sounds really weird, but we're so bad at relationships.
We are. Help us. Help.
All right. But,
you do it with me once.
Joey! Didn't think so.
Friends  S05E09 The One With Ross's Sandwich
Hey, Phoebe.
Hey, Pheebs.
What are you reading?
Um, Wuthering Heights.
I'm taking a literature class at the New School and I have to finish it for the first session tomorrow.
I didn't know you were taking a class. That is so cool.
I really liked that Lamaze class I took.
Y'know and this time I thought I'd go for something, y'know a little more intellectual,
...with a less painful final exam.
Honey that sounds like fun.
Yeah! Oh, you should come with me!
Oh yeah, Then I'll have someone to sit with.
Okay.
Yeah! Okay―ooh, but are you going to have time to read it?
Oh, I read that in high school.
This is going to be so much fun! .
Okay-shhh, I have to finish
Hi.
What's wrong, buddy?
Someone at work ate my sandwich.
What did the police say?
My Thanksgiving leftover sandwich.
I can't believe someone ate it.
Ross, It's just a sandwich.
Just a sandwich?
Look, I am 30 years old, okay? I'm about to be divorced twice and I just got evicted!
That sandwich was the only good thing going on in my life!
Someone ate the only good thing going on in my life!
I have enough stuff for one more sandwich,
I was going to eat it myself, but...
Mon, that would be incredible. Thank you so much.
I still can't believe someone ate it!
Look, I left a note and everything.
"Knock-knock." "Who's there?"
"Ross Geller's lunch."
"Ross Geller's lunch, who?"
"Ross Geller's lunch. Please don't take me. Okay?"
I'm surprised you didn't go home wearing your lunch.
Okay, look you wanna hold onto your food?
You gotta scare people off. I learned that living on the street.
Really? So what would you say Pheebs?
Stuff like, uh, "Keep your mitts off my grub."
Say Ross, when you picture Phoebe living on the street, is she surrounded by the entire cast of Annie?
Okay, This'll keep them away from your stuff.
Whoa! Ohh!!
Phoebe, you are a badass!
Someday I'll, tell you about the time I stabbed the cop.
Phoebe. He stabbed me first!
The Bronte sisters were remarkable women for their time.
They lived in a patriarchal society.
Sorry I'm late, but I left late.
Ahem. Okay.
So Pheebs, what is the book about?
Didn't you read it in high school?
Well yeah, but then I remembered I started it and there was this pep rally and I was,
I was on top of the pyramid .
but anyway.umm, what is this book about?
Okay, umm, It's a tragic love story between Cathy and Heathcliff.
and umm, It takes place on these creepy moors in England.
Which I think represent the wildness of Heathcliff's character.
I totally get symbolism.
How would you characterize the theme of this book?
Uh, let's see... Rachel Green?
Umm, well I would have to say that it's a tragic love story.
That's sort of a given...but, yes.
Anyone else?
Oh, oh, oh. Symbolism!
And uh, the-the uh, wildness of the mores...
which I think is mirrored in the wildness of  Heathcliff's character.
Excellent!
What Rachel has shrewdly observed here...
You completely stole my answer!
Honey, that was pretty obvious.
Well how would you know? You didn't read it!
What do you think?
Uh, you in the blue shirt?
I think that, um, yours is a question with many possible answers.
Would you care to venture one?
Would you care to venture one?
Are you just repeating what I'm saying?
Are you just repeating what I'm saying?
All right. Let's move on.
Okay, then.
Why didn't you say you hadn't read the book?
because I didn't want him to think I was stupid.
That was really embarrassing, what happened to you.
Phoebe! Phoebe! Yeah?
Your note? Amazing!
Not only did no one touch my sandwich...
...but people at work are actually afraid of me.
A guy called me "Mental.""Mental Geller."
I've always wanted a cool nickname like that.
The best you got in high school was, uh, "Wet Pants Geller."
That was the water fountain, okay?
Anyway...people are writing reports for me...
...uh, pushing back deadlines to fit my schedule.
I tell you, you get tough with people and you can get anything you want.
Hey, Tribbiani! Give me that coffee! Now!
This was really fun.
I've been wondering if you'd ask me out.
So you, uh, still wondering?
No. We just went out.
You're smart.I like that.
Oh, candles!
What is that, a blanket?A video camera? Oh, my God!
No, no, no. Wait.
I can't believe you thought you'd video tape us having sex on the first date!
Hi.
Joey, is what she just said, um...
Oh, my God!You're actually gonna
What is going on here?
And with Chandler in the next room. What are you, what are you sick?
I'm Joey.
I mean, I'm disgusting.
I make low-budget adult films.
You guys promised to be more careful!
I mean, come on! The good Joey name is being dragged through the mud here!
We're so sorry.
Well, I'm telling everyone about you!
That's the only way to explain the underwear and the video camera that doesn't make me look like a pig!
No-no, wait! There's got to be a better explanation.
You can tell them you had to make an adult film for your...adult film class.
Yeah, I like that. But no-no,
how does that explain why Rachel found my underwear at your place?
I don't know.
Well, get ready to come out of the non-gay closet!
Okay, just wait, please.I promise to come up with something.
Just give us a little more time.
All right Hey, but it better make me look really, really good.
Oh, and another thing, the video camera?
Nice!
Umm, Ross. May I have a word with you?
Of course, Donald.
We've been getting reports of some very angry behavior on your part.
What? .
Threatening letters..refusal to meet deadlines.
Apparently people now call you Mental.
Yeah.
We want you to speak to a psychiatrist.
Oh, no. Uh, you...You don't understand. This is so silly.
Um, this is all just because of a sandwich.
A sandwich?
You see, my sister makes these amazing turkey sandwiches.
Her secret is, she puts an extra slice of gravy-soaked bread in the middle.
I call it "The Moistmaker."
Anyway, I put my sandwich in the fridge...
Ha-ha-ha. Oh, you know what?
I'm sorry.I believe I ate that.
You ate my sandwich?
A simple mistake. It can happen to anyone.
Oh, really?
Did you confuse it with your own turkey sandwich with a Moistmaker?
No, I...Do you, perhaps, remember...seeing a note on top of it?
There may have been a joke or limerick of some kind.
That said it was...my sandwich!
Now calm down.
Come look in my office, some of it my still be in the trash.
What?
Well, it was quite large.
I-I-I-I-I had to throw most of it away.
You-you-you-you threw my sandwich away?
My sandwich?
Hi. Hi.
So umm, What's this book about?
You didn't read it, either?
Well, I was going to, but I, uh, accidentally read something else.
What?
Vogue.
Hey, So tell me about Jane Eyre.
No, You should've read it yourself!
Come on Phoebe! don't be such a goody-goody.
Fine.
Okay, all right. So Jane Eyre? First you'd think she's a woman, but she's not.
She's a cyborg.
A cyborg? Isn't that like a robot?
Yeah, This book was light years ahead of its time.
Sorry I'm late. Let's get started.
So, What did you think of Jane Eyre?
Um, Rachel and I were discussing it, and she actually had very interesting insights.
Go ahead, Rachel.
Um, thank you, Phoebe.
Umm, well, What struck me most when reading Jane Eyre...
...was, uh, how the book was so ahead of its time.
If you're talking about feminism, I think you're right.
Well, feminism, yes. But also the robots.
Hey. Hey.
Since that video camera thing didn't work out...
...I thought that I would give you just a little preview.
You're naked in this picture!
I know!
Ross?
Hey, Chandler.
Monica!
Ross, Are you okay?
I'm fine.
I saw a psychiatrist at work today.
Why?
On account of my rage.
Which, if I may say, right now is out of control.
He gave me a pill for it.
A pill?
Uh-huh. When the psychiatrist told me to take a leave of absence...
...because I yelled at my boss,
I started to get worked up again.
So he offered me a tranquilizer.
And I thought it was a good idea.
So I took it.
Wait a minute, They're making you take time off work?
And you're okay with that?
I don't know.
It's going to be weird not having a job for a while.
But I definitely don't care about my sandwich.
That's so embarrassing! I can't believe you let me go on like that!
I'm sorry.
It was just so funny when you started comparing Jane Eyre to Robocop.
That was not funny!
I snapped, okay?
You weren't taking the class seriously.
Phoebe, Come on! What is the big deal?
I thought it'd be something we could do together.
Y'know, I thought it would be fun.
Well, yeah! Fun is good.
but y'know I also wanted to learn.
People talk about what they learned in high school. I never went to high school.
Ohh. Oh, So you really wanted to learn.
Yeah, y'know, Pheebs, I just wanted to have fun.
Ohh, you know who you should go with?
I know! I know! I know!
Monica, you asked the question.
Oh, my God, that's Monica!
Oh, no, no, no!
You get away from me, You sick, sick, sick, sick-o!!
What's going on?
Joey has got a secret peephole!
Oh, no, no, no, no!
Yes! He has a naked picture of Monica!
He takes naked pictures of us,
then he eats chicken and looks at them!
Look. Oh! Dude, that's my sister!
Give me that! All right, Wait! Everybody just calm down. Okay?
Let's give our friend Joey a chance to explain why he's such a big pervert!
No! I am not a pervert! Okay?
It's just...I just kind of...
All right, look! Look. I think I can explain this.
Thank you.
Joey's a sex addict.
What? No, I'm not!
It's okay! It's good! It's good.
It's a disease.
No! No! I am not a sex addict!
Yes, you are!
That's the only way to explain all this stuff!
No, it isn't. No, it's not.
Because you could also explain it with the truth!
What is the truth?
What's up? What's going on?
I slept with Monica.
Well, let's see what everybody thinks of that.
Oh, no.
You slept with my sister?
Uh, yes, but it was...We just did it once, uh, in London.
This is not good for my rage.
Monica.Is this true?
Of course, it's true.
How else would you explain all the weird stuff that's been going on?
Yes, it's true.
Okay, but if it only happened that one time,
how come we found your underwear in our apartment the other day?
That was the underwear I was wearing that night in London. Right Monica?
I guess I wanted to keep it...as a souvenir.
My God, Monica!
Are you sure Joe? Are you sure you're not just a sex addict?
No! If anyone's a sex addict here, it's Monica!
Yeah. She has been trying to get me back in the sack ever since London!
That's why she gave you a naked picture of herself.
That makes sense.
And the video camera?
Uh, Monica?
I guess I set up the video camera to try and entice Joey.
But, sadly, I could not be enticed.
Unbelievable! You really kept Joey's underwear?
Why? Why would you do that?
I'm Monica.
I'm disgusting.
I stalk guys and keep their underpants.
Well, I think we've all learned something about who's disgusting and who's not. Eh?
All right. Now, I'm going to get back to my bucket.
I'm only eating the skin, so the chicken's up for grabs.
I really thought you making a good point.
I mean y'know, until you got cut off.
What's up with that girl Monica?
I don't know. I didn't come with her.
Hey, everybody! Everybody, guess what!
I just convinced Carl to give us a test next week!.
Test?
Come on! Tests make us all better learners!
Oh, yeah! We should have essay questions!
What are you doing? I reorganized the fridge, heh.
See? Uh, bottom shelf, meats and dairy.
Middle shelf, fruits and vegetables.
And top shelf, expired products.
Why are you doing this? Because I am bored out of my mind.
I've already been to the bank, post office and dry cleaners.
Dude, you just described seven days worth of stuff.
Gotta spread it out a little, you know. Haven't you ever been unemployed?
I am not unemployed. I'm on sabbatical.
Hey, don't get religious on me, okay?
A guy in your position needs to be a little better at relaxing, you know.
Why do you think we have the comfortable chairs, huh? Here, sit down.
Ready? Watch.
And then...
AW, yeah! Huh?
So, what? We just sit? Oh, no, no.
We're not gonna just sit. Watch.
Hello. Chandler Bing.
Hello, Mr. Bing.
I love you.
All right, whoever this is, stop calling me.
It's been six months! It's not funny!
But I love you.
Leave me alone! For the love of God, leave me alone!
And that's Wednesday. Ah!
Friends  S05E10  The One With The Inappropriate Sister
Hey, you guys. Guess what?
The British are coming'
Oh, you and your ways.
Since it's Christmas, I'm gonna be one of those people collecting donations.
Yeah. I already have my bell, and later on I get my bucket.
Yeah, yeah. I'll be spreading joy to the people.
Last year I spread a little joy, but not enough.
So this year, I'm gonna do the whole city. Heh.
I knew a girl in high school who did that. She was very popular.
Uh, so, Pheebs, where are you doing your bell ringing?
They gave me a great spot right by Macy's.
They never give such a good corner to a rookie...
...but I'm the only one who can say "Merry Christmas" in 25 languages.
I lied.
Oh, my God. Okay, you guys, here's Danny.
Just watch this.
See? Still pretending he's not interested.
Okay, he's coming over. Pretend we've forgotten who he is.
Hey, guys. Hey, Danny.
Oh, Danny! Hey!
Oh, uh...
Danny, you know Rachel. She's nice. She's not bad to look at, right?
Thanks, Mon. Of course.
Do you wanna go out on a date with her? Monica.
Absolutely. ls Friday okay?
Oh, my God.
Friday is perfect. She can't wait.
On the date, I will be able to talk to her directly, right?
See you Friday.
Okay, what the hell was that? You know what? Don't answer me.
I have a date with Danny. Ha!
How could I not get the part?
The play was about a 29-year-old Italian actor from Queens.
Well, Talia Shire suddenly became available.
She's a woman!
What can I say? She nailed it.
Uh, okay. ls there anything else?
Well, you're just gonna say no again, but...
---gay porn?
Happy holidays!
[Speak in Spanish]
And Merry Christmas.
Oh, thank you, sir. Here's some joy.
Hey. How's it going?
Well, it's going okay.
Oh, good. Here, let me help you out. Oh, thanks.
Yeah. Wow. Ha, ha.
Is that a new suede jacket? It looks really expensive.
Yeah. I guess.
Just get your nails done?
Yes, Phoebe, but this is all I have, okay?
Okay, thanks. Happy holidays.
Here's your joy. Thank you.
Thank you. Happy holidays and-Wait.
You can't take the money out. I'm making change for the bus.
Can't you leave the dollar? This money's for the poor.
I'm poor. I gotta take the bus.
Okay. Seasons greetings and everything. But still--
Bite me, blondie!
Oh, I'm gonna give him something besides joy. Just--
That part was perfect for me. I can't believe I didn't get it.
I'm sorry, man.
You know what you should do?
You should make something happen for yourself.
You know, like write a play.
Write a movie, huh? What about those Good Will Hunting guys?
Come on, Ross. Be realistic, you know? If I did write something...
...what are the chances I could get those guys to star in it?
Wait a second. I could star in it! Or that.
I can't write, you know. I mean, I'm an actor.
I don't have the discipline that it takes, you know. I can't do it.
I'll help you.
Yeah. I'll make up a schedule and make sure you stick to it.
Plus it'll give me something to do.
Really? You'd do that for me? Thanks. Yeah.
We'll start off slow. The only thing you have to do tonight...
...is come up with the name of your main character.
Done. And it can't be Joey.
It's not. Or Joseph.
Hi. What's up?
I just saw Danny getting on the subway with a girl...
...and he had his arm around her.
Oh, honey, I'm sorry.
Well, you should be. This is all your fault.
You meddled in our relationship.
You had no relationship.
No, but I was doing my thing, and everything...
...was going according to the plan!
Oh, God. Stop with the plan.
Unh. So what if you saw him with a girl?
Who cares? That doesn't mean anything.
You'll go out on a date with Danny and be so charming he'll forget all about...
...that stupid subway girl.
She was kind of stupid.
You're right. All right. I'm just gonna go on the date.
I'm just gonna go on the date. That is the new plan.
Hurry, hurry!
Hey, how do you spell "suspicious"? Why?
Because I think this character is gonna be suspicious about stuff.
Yes!
Chandler Bing, seven, Chandler Bing, zero.
You're driving me crazy with that.
Okay, I'll stop. No, don't stop.
Move the bowl further away. Ross could make that shot.
Well, you suck. But at least you suck at a man's game now.
You wanna play? I can't be playing games.
Ross will be home soon. I have to write five pages to stick to his schedule.
Well, so play for the next 30 minutes, then you can write until he gets home.
All right.
But, listen, what do you say we, uh...
...crank it up a notch?
I'm intrigued.
All right. All we need is a little lighter fluid.
Okay, but be careful. I wanna get our security deposit back.
Yeah, I think we said goodbye to that when we invented hammer darts.
Do you remember which part of the wall is not spackle?
Uh, yeah, right here.
Thank you. Happy holiday.
No, that's trash, young lady. No, you can't--
Hey. Stop that young lady! She donated trash!
Hey.
The charity's on fire!
Help! Good, thank you. I need that.
What is this? It's 9:00 in the morning.
All right. "A room.
A man enters. He looks suspicious."
That's it?
Joey, you were supposed to have five pages done by now...
...including an exciting incident.
What is all this? "The Official Rulebook of Fireball."
Yeah, that's the game we played.
Yeah, it's great. You take a tennis ball, a bowl and lighter fl--
This is helping your career, huh? You wanted to be an actor.
Not the creator of Crazy Lawsuit Game.
You're right, you're right. I'll get back to work.
And shame on you. You should know better. Joey needs to work.
Now come on. Hey.
No, uh-uh. You can have this back when the five pages are done, huh?
I had a really nice time tonight. So did I.
I'm really glad Monica asked us out.
I'd love to ask you in but my sister's visiting.
I think she's asleep on the couch. Your sister?
Your sister's asleep on the couch?
Ah, I saw you with her on the subway and now she's asleep on the couch.
Oh, I thought I heard you. Oh, hey, great, you're up.
Rachel, my sister Krista. Krista, Rachel.
Hi. Nice to meet you.
Wish you told me we were having company. I'd have fixed myself.
Like it would help. You are so bad.
You are. You are.
You are. You are. You are. You are!
You are so dead. Ha.
I'm gonna get you. Aah!
Um, it's very nice to meet you.
Nobody. Nobody respects the bucket.
You wouldn't believe what people put in here.
Look. Okay, does this look like...
...a garbage can to you? No.
Does it look like an ashtray? No.
Does it look like a urinal?
Ew!
So, Pheebs, you gonna go back out there? Yeah, but I'm not gonna take any more crap.
Okay? No more Mrs. Nice Bucket.
Yeah, good for you. You're tough. You lived on the street.
Yeah, I'm gonna go back to being Street Phoebe.
Yeah. Oh, but you know what? I can't go totally back...
...because Street Phoebe really wouldn't be friends with you guys.
Hey. Hey.
Um, can I ask you guys something? Sure.
Urn, I don't have any brothers so I don't know, but did you guys wrestle?
Oh, yeah. All the time.
In fact, I was undefeated.
Well, you weighed 200 pounds.
Still, I was quick as a cat.
Well, I met Danny's sister yesterday.
Uh, that was the girl on the subway. Oh, you're kidding.
And they were very, you know...
...wrestle-y.
But I guess that's normal?
We don't wrestle now.
Not since I got too strong for you. Ha, ha.
Too strong for me? Yeah.
You wanna go right now?
Because I'll take you right now, buddy. You wanna go?
Oh, fine.
Ready?
Wrestle!
Okay, you know what, um?
Actually, that's great. That helps a lot. Thanks.
Guys, come on, let's go. The puck drops in 20 minutes. Come on. Joey.
Joey's not going. I didn't finish my five pages.
Why can't you finish them tomorrow?
Because tomorrow he's redoing yesterday's pages.
Yesterday's pages did not reflect my best work.
Why don't you cut him a little slack? Maybe if he relaxes, he'll get some work done.
I think he's been relaxing enough, thanks to you...
...and Fireball.
If you think Fireball's relaxing, you obviously have never played.
The only reason you're doing this to Joey is you're bored.
It's not his fault that you're unemployed.
I am not unemployed. I'm on sabbatical.
Look, look. Guys, don't fight.
And the reason I'm doing this is because I am Joey's friend.
And if you were a good friend, you'd be doing the same thing.
So being a good friend means acting like a jerk?
If it does, then you're an amazing friend of mine.
Hey, guys. How about we settle this over a friendly game of Fireball, huh?
I'll go unhook the smoke detectors. How about we settle this right now?
There. Now no one's going to the game. Ha-ha-ha.
I paid for those tickets. No, you didn't.
You said you would, but you never did. Oh, yeah.
So we finally get to the top of the mountain, ahem...
...and airhead here forgets the camera.
You know, that same thing happened to me one time.
When did that happen to you?
Don't you remember? We were jogging in the park, we saw that pretty bird.
And I wanted to take a picture but I didn't have my camera.
Okay. First of all, chasing the churro guy is not jogging.
Oh, this is so good. You have got to try it.
That is good.
Oh, damn. I got it on my pants. Here, I'll get it.
We better take these off or that stain will set.
I wanna wear these pants on our date tonight. Oh, great.
Okay, bye. Oh, my God.
That was unbelievable. Okay, see? I told you.
Yeah, wow. Sorry, Rash. I don't believe they're brother and sister.
They're brother and sister?
Wait a minute. Open your hand. Let me take a look.
Quarter, dime. Lint? Not interested in that.
What's this? A Canadian coin? Get out of here!
Gosh.
Whoa. No drinks near the bucket.
Set it down over there and then you can make a contribution.
And you can leave the "hurt bunny" look over there too.
Hi, Bob. I thought I told you to get out of here!
Uh, Phoebe, we've been getting complaints.
And we're gonna move you to a less high-profile spot.
What?
Uh, Ginger's gonna take over this corner. That chick can't handle my corner.
Look, either you leave or we remove you.
Fine.
All right, I'll give you one pointer. Look out for that bitch.
Oh, hey, Rach. I thought we said 7. Yeah, uh, you know what? Uh, let's skip it.
What? Uh, why?
Um... Look.
You and your sister seem to have, um, a very special bond--
Oh, great. That "special bond" again.
Why do women have such a problem with the fact that I'm close with my sister?
Okay, look, I don't know, but-Do you have brothers?
No, I have two sisters, but one of them actually has a very masculine energy.
Are you close with them? No, no. They're not very nice people.
Okay, come here. Listen.
I really like you, okay? I think this could go somewhere.
So what if I'm close to my family? You gonna let that stand in the way of us?
Well, I-I don't know...
See, when you put it that way, you know--
Danny, hurry up. The bath's getting cold.
What? Yeah, okay, I'll see you later.
Oh, hey. There's some kids playing in the street.
You wanna go down there, give them a project, ruin their day?
Hey, if they have a ball, maybe you could stick razor blades in it...
...and teach them a new game: "Gonna-Need-Stitches Ball."
Hey, guys. I was at the library all morning and I already finished my five pages for today.
Great. Now we can go to the Ranger game last night.
No, dude. Ross tore up the tickets.
I guess when you don't have so many distractions, it's easier for you to focus, huh?
Yeah, or also when you don't have somebody breathing down your neck all the livelong day!
Well, that's fine, but the important thing is I finished it. And I think it's really good.
But you know what would help me, is if I could hear it. Would you guys read it for me?
Yeah, all right. All right.
Okay. "It's a typical New York City apartment.
Two guys are hanging out." Ross?
"Hey, man." "What is up?"
"About yesterday. I was really wrong. I am sorry."
"No, it was me. I'm sorry. I overreacted."
"Maybe it was both of us. But we had our best friend's inter--
But we had our best friend's interest at heart."
"Could I be more sorry?"
"I don't know. I am one sorry...
...polontologist."
All right, Joey, we get it.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry too.
Oh, no, no, no. Keep reading. The good part's coming up. Keep going.
"I am sorry, Chandler."
"I am sorry, Ross."
Ahem. "A handsome man enters."
"Hey. How's it going, guys?
I don't know what you two are talking about, but I'd just like to say thanks to both of you.
You. You wouldn't let me give up on myself.
And you. Well, you co-created Fireball.
The End." Yeah.
This took you all day?
No, no, this only took five minutes.
I spent the rest of the day coming up with New Ultimate Fireball. Ha, ha!
Okay. "it's a typical New York apartment.
Two girls are just hanging out." Go.
"Hi, how are you doing, Kelly?" "I'm doing just fine.
God, Tiffany, you smell so great."
"it's my new perfume.
Why don't you come closer where you can really appreciate it?"
Oh, you know, Joey, you are sick. This is disgusting.
I'm not reading this.
What? Wait, wait, wait. The handsome man was about to enter!
Is there any entertainment there? What are people doing?
All right. Here we go. 1999, the year of Joey.
We're very happy for you.
What's the matter?
We wanted to kiss at midnight, but nobody else is going to so, you know...
All right, I'll take care of it. Oh, no.
Joey.
Thirty-three, 32, 31. Ross, Ross, Ross.
Listen, who are you kissing at midnight? Rachel or Phoebe?
What? Well, you gotta kiss someone.
Can't kiss your sister. Who's gonn但a kiss my sister?
Chandler. Oh, man. Really?
Who would you rather have kiss your sister? Me or Chandler.
That's a good point. Yeah.
Uh, well, since I have that whole history with Rachel, I guess Phoebe.
Okay, great. Pheebs, Pheebs. Listen. Ross wants to kiss you at midnight.
So obvious. Why doesn't he just ask?
Rash, Rash. Listen, I'm going to kiss you at midnight.
What? You can't kiss Ross. You got the history.
So? So?
Would you prefer me or Chandler? Oh, good point.Yeah.
Three, two, one.
Happy New Year!
Happy New Year. Happy New Year.
Happy New Year, Pheebs. You too.
Happy New Year, Joey.
So that do anything for you?
Friends  S05E11 The One With All The Resolutions
You know what?
I'm going to go out on a limb and say, "No divorces in '99."
But your divorce isn't even final yet.
Just the one divorce in '99.
You know what? I'm gonna be happy this year.
I'm gonna make myself happy.
Do you want us to leave the room or...?
Every day, I am going to do one thing I have never done before.
That, my friends, is my New Year's resolution.
Ooh. That's a good one. Yeah?
Mine is to pilot a commercial jet.
That's a good one too. Now you only have to find a planeload of people...
...whose resolution is to plummet to their deaths.
Maybe your resolution should be not to make fun of your friends.
Especially the ones who may soon be flying you to Europe for free...
...on their own plane.
She has a better chance of sprouting wings and flying up your nose...
...than you do of not making fun of us.
In fact, I'll bet you 50 bucks you can't go the whole year without making fun of us.
You know what? Better yet, a week.
I'll take that bet, my friend.
And you know what? Paying me the 50 bucks can be...
...the "new thing you do" that day.
And it starts right now.
All right, my New Year's resolution is to learn how to play guitar.
Really? How come? Ah.
You know those special skills I have listed on my resume?
I would love it if one of those was true.
Do you want me to teach you? I'm a great teacher.
Really? Who have you taught?
Well, I taught me and I loved me.
That'd be great. Yeah, thanks, Pheebs.
Oh, look. Blaire forgot her glasses.
She's gonna be needing these to keep an eye on that boyfriend.
Who, from what I hear, needs to keep his stapler...
...in his desk drawer, if you know what I'm talking about.
Hey, Rach, maybe your resolution should be to, urn, gossip less.
What? I don't gossip.
Maybe sometimes I find out things.
Or I hear something and I pass that information on.
You know, kind of like a public service.
Doesn't mean I'm a gossip. I mean, would you call Ted Koppel a gossip?
Well, if Ted Koppel talked about his coworkers' botched boob jobs...
...yeah, I would.
Well, they were like this.
I'll see you tomorrow. Okay.
Hey. Hey.
I just asked that girl out.
Nice. Nice. Yeah.
Is that part of your resolution, your "new thing" for today?
Yes, it is. See?
"Elizabeth...
...Hornswoggle"?
That's right.
Elizabeth Hornswoggle.
Hornswoggle.
You okay, Chandler? ls there something--?
Something funny about that name?
No, no, I just think that maybe I've heard it somewhere before.
Oh, really? Where?
Somewhere funny I'll bet.
Hey, Pheebs. Guess what? Hey.
Uh, I have a date with, uh, Elizabeth Hornswoggle.
Hornswoggle?
Oh, this must be killing you.
All right, see you later. See you.
All right, Pheebs, I am ready for my first lesson.
Okay. Oh, no, no, you don't touch the guitar.
No, no. First you learn here, then you learn here.
Oh. Okay. Okay.
Okay. Lesson One: Chords. Ah.
Now, um, I don't know the actual names of the chords, um...
But I made up names for the way my hand looks while I'm doing them.
So then, this is "Bear Claw."
Okay, "Turkey Leg"...
...and "om Lady."
What an interesting approach to guitar instruction.
You know, some might find it amusing. I myself find it regular.
Hey, everybody.
Rachel was so good today. She didn't gossip at all.
I didn't. Even when I found out, um--
All right, let's just say I found out something about someone...
...and let's just say...
...she's gonna keep it.
Hey, Pheebs. Check this out.
Ooh. You nailed the Old Lady. Oh!
Hey, listen, I thought I was getting better...
...so on my way home today I stopped by this guitar store--
Did you touch any of the guitars while you were there?
Did you?
No.
Give me your hands.
Strings.
Pick.
Do you want to learn to play guitar?
Yes. Then don't touch one!
Hi. Hi.
Hi, Ben. Auntie Monica.
Ross is wearing leather pants.
Does nobody else see that Ross is wearing leather pants?
Someone comment on the pants.
I think they're very nice. I really like them a lot.
Not what I had in mind.
See, people like Ross don't generally wear these types of pants.
You see, they're very tight.
Maybe there's something in that area?
I think they look really good. I like them.
Yeah, where did you get them?
See, I needed a new thing for today.
And there's this leather store I go by that always smells so good.
And I thought to myself, "Wow. You know, I've never owned...
...a really good-smelling pair of pants before."
Oh, come on.
Okay, seriously. What do you think?
You look like a freak. Yeah, awful. Awful.
Hey. What are you doing? What are you doing?
It's my New Year's resolution. To blind my child?
No, to take more pictures of all of us together.
I really think it's the best resolution. Everyone can enjoy them.
Well, everyone will enjoy my music as well.
My God, these pants. I'm burning up.
Oh, God. She wants to snuggle now? What, is she trying to kill me?
It's like a volcano in here.
Are you hot? No.
Okay, it must just be me then.
That was just the pants and the couch.
Um, hey, do you mind if I use your bathroom?
Oh, go ahead. Thanks.
Hey, my favorite part's coming up.
0key-
Oh, my God!
Tiger. Dragon.
Iceberg.
Joseph, did you even study at all last night?
Yes. Yes, I did. Then do Iceberg.
G-sharp. G-sharp?
Have you been studying the real names of the chords?
Have you?
Oh, my God.
What? I didn't touch a guitar.
No, but you're questioning my method.
No, I'm not questioning it, Phoebe. I'm saying it's stupid.
What?
Thank you.
You know, none of my other student...
...thought I was stupid.
Your other student was you!
Yeah, well, you know, maybe you just need to try a little harder.
Maybe I need to try a real teacher.
Right here. Here. Andy Cooper. He teaches guitar.
And look. Ooh, there's a picture of him with a kid.
Yeah, and the kid's got a guitar!
Fine. You go learn from your qualified instructor.
But don't come crying to me when everyone is sick and tired...
...of hearing you play "Bad, Bad Leroy Brown."
Baddest man in the whole damn town
Oh, fine. Take his side.
I can 'I' wait to be with you.
I'll sneak over as soon as Ross picks up Ben.
I'll tell Rachel I'm gonna be doing laundry for a couple hours.
Laundry. Huh. Is that my new nickname?
Aw.
You know what your nickname is, Mr. Big--
Hello? Joey, it's Ross. I need some help.
Uh, Chandler's not here.
Well, you can help me.
Okay. Listen.
I'm in Elizabeth's bathroom.
Nice.
No, I got really hot in my leather pants so I took them off.
But they must have shrunk from the sweat or something.
Or my legs expanded from the heat.
I can't get them back on, Joey. I can't.
Oh. That is quite a situation.
Uh, do you see any, like, powder?
Powder. Yeah, yeah, I have powder.
Good, good. Okay.
Sprinkle some on your legs. It'll absorb moisture.
Then you can get your pants back on.
Yeah, hold on.
They're not coming on, man.
Um, you see any--? Oh, Vaseline?
I see lotion. I have lotion. Will that work?
Yeah, sure, throw some of that on there. Hold on.
ROSS, you okay?
They're still not coming on, man.
And the lotion and the powder have made a paste.
Really?
Uh, what color is it?
What difference does that make?
Well, if the paste matches the pants, you can make yourself paste pants...
...and she won't know the difference.
Joey, do you have a minute?
Dude, what am I--?
Rachel's here, so good luck, man. Let me know how it works out.
Oh, Joey, I have such a problem.
Oh, well, your timing couldn't be better.
I'm putting out fires all over the place.
Okay, okay. Joey, I have got to tell you something.
What is it? What is it?
Oh, my God. It's so huge. But you have to promise me, you cannot tell anyone.
No, no, no. I don't want to know. What?
Yes, yes, yes. You do want to know. This is unbelievable.
I don't care, Rach. Look, I'm tired of being the guy who knows all the secrets...
...and can't tell anyone.
You know secrets? What are they?
And you're not supposed to be gossiping.
No, I know, I can't keep this in. So I pick upthe phone--
I'm not listening to you.
Ross? Um...
You've been in there for a long time.
I'm starting to get kind of freaked out.
All right, I'm coming out.
Hey, can you turn the lights off?
No. Let's just leave the lights on.
Oh, my God.
I had a problem.
Hey, Pheebs.
Oh, I can't talk to you. I don't have a fancy ad in the yellow pages.
Look.
Pheebs, I just...
I want to apologize for saying your method was stupid.
And maybe, ask you to be my teacher again?
And I promise, I won't touch a guitar until you say I'm ready.
You really think I'm ready? Uh-huh.
Wow, cool.
0Key-
Was the chord at least right before--? No.
Oh, my God.
We heard about your pants. I'm so sorry.
This year was supposed to be great.
Well, it's only the second day, and I'm a loser...
...with stupid leather pants that don't even fit.
You're not a loser.
Look at me.
Hey, look. Look, Ross.
Ben drew a picture of you.
Huh? You're a cowboy.
Because of the leather pants?
Ben doesn't think you're a loser. He thinks you're a cowboy.
I mean, that's something.
It really is something. Howdy, partner. Hey.
Maybe I should get another pair.
Ooh, you know, they had some...
...with fringe all down the sides.
I'm gonna go kiss Ben good night.
I can't believe he thinks I'm a cowboy.
I would make a good cowboy.
Okay, now that everything's wrapped up here, I'm gonna go do my laundry.
Yeah, me too. You know, if this shirt is dirty. Yep.
Okay, I'm gonna go to.
I'm gonna go to the airport. If I hang around there long enough...
...someone's bound to leave one of those planes unattended.
Good luck, honey. Bye.
Hey, uh, Joey, remember that big thing I was going to tell you about?
I'm not gonna tell you. But if you found out on your own...
...that would be okay, and then we could talk about it, right?
Well, then it wouldn't be a secret. So, yeah, that would be okay. Yeah, yeah.
Hey, Joe, would you mind going over into Chandler's bedroom...
...and getting that book back that he borrowed from me?
Now? You want me to go over there now?
Yeah.
Do you know something? Do you know something?
I might know something. I might too something too.
What's the thing you know? You tell me what you know.
I can't tell you. Then I can't.
Okay, fine.
You don't know.
How about I go there and walk into Chandler's bedroom and see the thing...
...that I think I know is actually the thing I think I know.
You know. And you know.
Yeah, I know.
Chandler and Monica? Oh, this is unbelievable.
How long have you known? Too long. Oh, my God.
Rach, I've been dying to talk to someone about this for so long.
Listen, listen. You can't say anything to anybody. They're so weird about that.
Listen. Hey, Phoebe. Hey.
It's raining. I don't like to fly in the rain so...
Oh, I am going to go for a walk in the rain. Ha, ha.
Oh, yeah, me too.
That's weird.
I bet they're doing it.
Oh, good. Okay, look. I can't take it anymore. I can't take it anymore.
So you win. Okay? Here.
Pheebs? Flying a jet? Better make it a spaceship...
...so you can get back to your home planet.
And Ross. Phone call for you today. Tom Jones. He wants his pants back.
And Hornswoggle? What, are you dating a character from Fraggle Rock?
Come on, Joey!
Rach, I told you everything I knew last night.
It's not that big a deal. So Monica and Chandler are doing it.
I cannot believe you would say that!
Sorry. Monica and Chandler are "making love."
No, I mean, come on. This is a huge deal!
I need more details. Who initiated the first kiss?
I don't know.
Is he romantic with her?
I don't know.
Are they in love?
I don't know. Ugh.
You don't know anything.
Oh! I know one thing. What?
They did it right there on the couch.
Friends  S05E12  The One With Chandler's Work Laugh
Hey, Ross. Yeah.
Gunther, could I have a scone, please?
Want to hear some good news?
Someone I know is getting married.
Yeah, weddings are happy occasions. Oh, by the by, it's my ex-wife, Emily!
Sorry, man.
Here's your scone. Thanks, Gunther.
Thanks.
Stupid British snack food!
Did they teach you that in anger management class?
You know what might help deal with it? Think of it this way.
You and Emily are in the past. You can't be mad about the past.
Are you still mad about, you know, the Louisiana Purchase?
I don't think anybody's mad about that. Exactly! Because it's in the past.
Anybody going to eat that?
Look at us all dressed up for the big office party! By the way, what are we celebrating?
We had a lot of liquor left over from the Christmas party.
I think this is cool. Because none of our friends are here.
We can be a real couple. We don't have to hide.
I know. I can do this. Ooh.
And I can do this.
We can't do that. We can't do that.
Hey, Bing! Ha-ha-ha.
Whoa! Who's the pretty lady, and what the hell is she doing with you?
Ha-ha-ha! I ask myself that very question. This is Monica.
My boss, Doug. This is Monica. Hi, nice to meet you.
Hi! This is my wife, Kara. Nice to meet you.
Bing! Okay!
Did you hear about the new law firm working for us?
No, sir. Yeah, Dewey, Cheatem & Howe.
Come on, let's go drink our body weight.
What was that? What?
That noise you just made?
Oh, that was my work laugh. Your work laugh?
believe me, to survive this party, you're gonna have to come up with one too.
All right. Check me out. Okay.
He says, "$30, Father. Same as in town." Ha!
Hey, everybody at work loved you last night.
Really? And they like me more...
...just because I was with you.
think you repaired a lot of the damage from when they met Joey.
Doug wants us to play tennis. He's never talked to me outside of work.
Except for that time when we bumped into each other at that strip club.
Strip church.
Anyway, I'm gonna go try to find a racket. I thought you had one.
I used to, but then Joey thought it'd be fun to go to Central Park and hit rocks...
...at bigger rocks.
Hey, Rach, do you have a tennis racket? Hey.
Oh, um, I lent it to Joey and I've never gotten it back.
Okay, good luck with that.
Ahem. Hey. Hey.
What's up?
What are you doing here? I thought you had to do inventory all day.
Well I do, but I decided I'd take a long lunch...
...and spend some time with my friend, Monica.
You know, I feel like we don't talk anymore.
How are you?
What is new with you?
Not much. Um, work's good.
We don't have to talk about work. We could talk about anything.
Okay. Um...
Hey! You know what?
Let's talk about relationships.
Okay. What's going on with you? Nothing.
You go.
Well, I... There was this guy at the bank that I thought was cute.
Um, but I don't anymore.
Wow, that's, uh, juicy. Ahem, um...
You know what? I actually do have a lot of work to do.
You're sure there's just not anything else?
Yes, I'm sure. Is there something you want to talk to me about?
No.
I...
If there was, I wouldn't tell you.
Okay, then what happened?
Ah-ah, you'll get your turn.
Hey, Pheebs. What's going on? Hey. Nothing.
This is not over.
No, no, no! What?
Ugh, I was up all night writing this really nasty letter to Emily.
It was perfect, and now it's all covered in...
Actually, thanks!
All right! Everybody ready to go to the movies?
Uh, actually, I think I'm gonna skip it.
Really? I'm gonna stay and read my book.
I just want to be alone right now.
Oh. Sure you don't want to come?
Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan. They get mail and stuff.
That's okay, Joe. All right.
Let's go, Pheebs.
Oh, God!
Bing!
Game!
Yeah, I gotta tell you, that partner of yours is a real tiger.
Are you all right?
We'll just get a little sip of water.
Am I on fire today or what?
Those birds are browned, basted and ready to be carved.
Okay, easy, Martina.
I think we should let them win the next game.
I'm sorry, I don't understand what you just said.
Let them win one.
Are you crazy? We own those two. Look at them!
He can't even breathe, and she's popping pills.
You're not giving them a chance.
They have rackets, don't they?
Uh, Bing, I think we're gonna make this the last game.
Yes, sir. Put me out of my misery.
Are you sure you never played pro? Ha-ha-ha.
Please let them win.
I'll take it down to 95 percent, but that's the best I can do.
Oopsie! Missed it! I got it!
Nice shot.
I got it!
Long!
I can't believe you let them win.
Yeah, well, at least you hid your feelings well about it.
I was frustrated. It was my racket.
I was frustrated with you!
If we hadn't lost, they would never have invited us to dinner tomorrow.
What bothers me...
...is how different you act around them.
The throwing the tennis games, the fake laugh...
...the "See you later, Bing!" "Not if I see you first, Doug!"
I gotta tell you, I don't like "work Chandler." The guy's a suck-up.
You know what? Because you said that...
...I'm not putting out tonight!
I'm telling you,Something's wrong. My brother does not stay out all night.
Maybe we should check the trash chute.
Ross couldn't fit down the trash chute.
That's right. He almost could.
Which is exactly how I got stuck there.
Oh, my God!
Where the hell have you been?
Just, you know, out.
Oh, out! God, I don't know why we didn't think to check there.
What were you doing?
I, uh, went to a bar and then...
...I just, uh, walked around for a while.
You walked around all night in the city by yourself?
He hooked up!
He hooked up with someone.
I don't have to answer your questions. Okay? I'm a big boy.
I can do whatever I want.
He hooked up!
Tell us about her!
Ross, you left your scarf...
Hey, you guys.
Okay. Okay.
I know what you all are thinking, but Chandler is in Yemen.
I'm a young woman. I have needs. I can't wait forever.
Yeah, no, that's what I was thinking.
So I'm asking you, please just take a moment before you judge me.
Oh, nobody's judging you.
Oh.
Okay, you, Mr. Right-place-at-the-right-time...
...call me.
Okay, look, I know what you guys are going to say.
You two would have very hairy children.
I didn't know you'd say that.
Ross! Janice?
All right. Hold on, hold on, hold on.
This is Ross. Okay?
He's our friend. He obviously went crazy.
He obviously lost his mind.
I didn't lose my mind, okay? Janice and I have a lot in common.
We've both been divorced. We both have kids.
Are you actually going to see her again?
Don't put ideas in his head! I am gonna see her again.
Damn it, Phoebe!
Okay, I have to tell you something that I have never admitted during our entire friendship
But, when we were in high school I made out with James Farrell even when I knew that you liked him!
Wow! That feels so good to get off my chest. Okay, you go.
My turn? What are you talking about? Ugh.
Monica...
I know about you and Chandler.
What?
I overheard you on the phone the other day.
You said, "I'll tell Rachel I'm doing laundry for a couple of hours."
And he said, "Laundry? Is that my new nickname?"
And you said, "No.
You know what your nickname is, Mr. Big."
Well, heh...
Sounds like you're writing yourself a little play there, Rach.
Wow, I... Let me know how that one turns out.
I wouldn't know because I got so freaked out I hung up the phone.
Well, if you had kept listening, ha-ha-ha...
...you would have heard me call him Mister Big...
...ot. What?
Mr. Bigot.
Ha, ha. He tells the most racist jokes.
All right. So that's it.
You're telling me there's nothing going on between you and Chandler?
Me and Chandler?
Put your $20 down. Okay.
First one to find the tasty treat wins.
Okay? All right. Mm-hm.
Let's get the contestants out of their isolation booths.
And they're off!
Whoa.Get your foot off my contestant! Judge?
Judge rules no violation.
Hey, guys. Yeah.
It's so weird to say this, but I just had a great date with Janice.
What? Are you serious?
Yeah. I opened up to her about all the terrible stuff that's been happening to me.
I mean, I talked for hours.
It is amazing...
...to have someone give you such focused attention.
You don't need Janice for that. You've got us.
And the duck gets the Nutter Butter! No! Agh!
That's not a Nutter Butter. That's an old won ton!
Judge rules...
...Nutter Butter. Ugh.
Tough call. Yeah.
Seriously, I strongly believe that we should all support President Clinton...
...and her husband, Bill.
So how do you like your coffee?
None for me. Just a little bit of sugar.
Well, maybe I'll bring it out and have Monica stick her finger in it.
That ought to sweeten it up.
How does that laugh not give you a headache? You get used to it.
I don't think that I can.
So if you don't mind, maybe this will be it for me on the work things.
So I laugh at my boss's jokes. What's the big deal?
I'd rather hang out with a sniveling work weasel guy
...when I could be hanging out  with my boyfriend, who I actually respect.
Oh.
Ah, heh.I gotta apologize for Kara's coffee.
I'd feel sorry for it if it got in a fight.
It's not strong enough to defend itself. Ha-ha-ha!
Did you hear what I said Bing?
What?
It's a joke, Bing. What's the matter with you?
Well, I just didn't think it was funny, sir.
Excuse me?
Well, I just... Honey?
I just don't think you understood the joke.
Really? Yeah.
I mean, it was really funny. I just don't think that you got it.
Heh, you see, Kara's coffee is weak-tasting.
But what Doug did was imply that it was weak physically.
You get it now, honey? I think I do!
Thank you, Monica. I thought you could use the help.
Coffee in a fight!
Hey, Rach.
You mind if I read my comic books in here?
Sure. Why?
Chandler and Monica are over there. It's kind of hard to concentrate.
What? She just called and said she was going to be working late.
She keeps lying to me.
That's it! I'm gonna go over there and I'm confronting them right now.
So you're telling me that I have to tell racist jokes now?
I'm just not very good at this.
I'm a terrible liar. I hate having to lie to Rachel.
But we're not ready to tell yet. I know.
Ever since high school, Rachel was the one person that I told everything to.
I miss that so much now.
She's my best friend.
Joey?
Oh, my God, Rachel! Hey!
Hi!
What are you doing here?
Well, I actually came over here to borrow this lamp...
...to, um, look at my books.
You know, see them a little better. Heh.
Okay, great. Great. Um... Yeah.
Well, what I was doing in Chandler's room is that, um...
...I was cleaning it.
In fact, he pays me to clean it. Oh!
What a great way to make some extra pocket money.
When I said to you earlier that I was at work, um...
...I'm at my new work.
Good enough. Right?
Okay, well, um...
I'm gonna go look at my books.
Okay. Go get back to my new job. Okay.
Okay.
Congratulations on your new job!
Man, she is really gullible.
Here you go. Thanks.
Actually, I should get going. You're sure?
I can stay out as late as you want.
I told you I'm on sabbatical from work...
Yes, yes. You did. Ha-ha-ha.
Oh, man! What is wrong now?
This isn't what I ordered.
Man! Can't anything go right in my life?
First, my marriage falls apart, and then...
I know, I know!
You lose your apartment, then you lose your job...
...then your ex-wife gets married so fast! And now the coffee!
Ross...
...we need to talk. Okay.
Sometimes I feel... No, no, don't.
I'm going to talk.
I believe...
...that the sun has set...
...on our day in the sun.
What? You're a very sweet person, Ross.
Unfortunately...
...I just don't think I can take another second of you whining!
Let me make sure I'm hearing this right.
You're ending this with me because...
...I'm too whiny?
So you're saying...
...I've become so whiny...
...that I...
...annoy you...
...Janice.
Well, yeah!
Oh, my God!
Are you gonna be okay? I am now.
Okay.
Hi. Oh, hi.
Well...
I guess, that's two out of three...
...Joey!
Dude, we gotta talk. Okay.
I want to tell you something before you heard it from someone else.
I hope this isn't too weird but, uh...
...I had a thing with Janice.
You're not mad?
Why would I be mad?
Because there's certain rules about this kind of stuff.
You don't, uh... You don't fool around with your friends' ex-girlfriends...
...or, uh...
...possible girlfriends or girls they're related to.
I am mad.
But you know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna forgive you.
Because that's what friends do.
They forgive their friends when they do everything you just said.
All the things on the list there. Thank you.
But I want you to remember...
...that I forgave you.
Okay. I also want you to remember...
...that I let you live here rent-free.
All right. And I want you to remember...
...that I gave you 27 dollars.
No strings attached!
If you can't remember that...
...I think we should write it down. Let's write it down!
Ah, I can't believe we've never done this before! It's sooo good!
So good for Monica!
Oh! Look at that, Time's up! My turn.
That was half an hour? It's your timer.
Okay. All right.
I don't like to brag about it, but I give the best massages.
All right, then massage me up right nice!
It's so good, isn't it?
It's so good I don't know what I've done to deserve it!
Say goodbye to sore muscles!
Goodbye, muscles!
Friends  S05E13  The One With Joey's Bag
She gives the worst massages ever.
It was like she was torturing me for information.
I wanted to give it up. I just didn't know what it was!
If it hurts that bad, you should tell her.
For the first time in my life, I'm in a real relationship.
I won't screw that up by telling the truth.
Dude, look out!
You almost crushed my hat.
Sorry.
And the bunny got away.
This would be the place where you explain the hat.
There's this play, right?
I'm up for the part of this cool,
suave, international guy.
A clothes horse, so I figure...
..everyone at the audition
is gonna be wearing wear ultra-hip, high fashion stuff.
And you'll make them disappear?
Like you could find something this sophisticated.
Done!
Joey，If you want to look good, why don't you just come down to the store?  I'll help you out.
Great! Thanks! Sure.
God, please take those off!
Hey, Pheebs. How's it going?
Um, only okay. Because I just got back from the hospital.
Are you all right?
I'm fine. But, uh, my grandma sort of died.
Pheebs, sorry. It's okay.
She had a really incredible life.
It's not like I won't see her again. y'know she's gonna visit.
Well maybe, Maybe she's with us right now.
Right. her first day on a new spiritual plane and she'll come to the coffeehouse.
Guys! Guys! I just saw two people having sex in a car right outside!
Uh, Pheebs' grandmother just died.
Oh, my God! I'm so sorry.
It's okay. Actually y'know what, it's kind of cool. 'Cause it's like ...
...you know, one life ends and another begins.
Not the way they're doing it.
What, What happened? How did she die?
We were in the market...
...and she bent down to get some yogurt and she just never came back up again.
Pheebs, I'm so sorry.
It was really sweet. The last thing she said to me was:
"Okay dear, you go get the eggs and I'm gonna get the yogurt and we'll meet at the checkout counter"
You know what?
We will meet at the checkout counter.
Okay now Joey, y'know that since you're returning all of this stuff.
right after the audition you're gonna have to wear underwear?
All right. You'd better show me some of that too then..
It's missing something.
Oh, I know. Um, okay.
Really? A purse?
It's not a purse. It's a shoulder bag.
It looks like a woman's purse. No.
Trust me, all the men are carrying them in the spring catalog.
See, look. Men carrying the bag.
See, look. Women carrying the bag.
But it is odd how a woman's purse looks so good on me, a man.
Exactly. Unisex!
Maybe you need sex. I had sex a couple days ago.
No, Joey. U-N-I sex.
I ain't going to say no to that!
Who is it? It's Phoebe.
Oh, great!
Oh, you.
Um, what's up?
Um, well, I sort of have some bad news. Can I come in?
Um, no, thanks.
Well, um, Grandma died today. Wow!
Didn't she die like five years ago?
No, she just died today.
Um, we're having a memorial service tomorrow.
Okay, I know I went to that already.
No, you didn't!
Then who's been dead?
Lots of people!
 Look, are you coming to memorial service or not?
Um, no.
See I already thought she was dead so I kinda made my peace with it.
Plus, I'm going to a concert tomorrow.
I'd invite you, but, um, I only have two tickets left.
Fine. Okay, enjoy your concert. Thanks. Enjoy your funeral!
Hey. Hey.
You look just like your son, Mrs. Tribbiani.
What? Are you referring to my man's bag?
At first, I thought it just looked good, but it's practical too. Check it out!
It's got compartments for all your stuff.
Your wallet, keys, address book... Your makeup.
Joey, what are you doing with the bag? You're audition is not until tomorrow.
Yeah, but sandwich time is right now.
Joey, y'know you get any mustard on that bag, you can't return it.
Why would I return this? I love this bag!
All right, then you owe me $350. Fine.
Do you take Vasa or Mooster Card?
Joey...
All right relax
look I'll pay you with the money from the acting job I am definitely gonna get thanks to you.
What's the part? Auntie Mame?
Don't listen to them. I think it's sexy.
You-and-I sexy?
Hello, Mrs. Pinilla. Thank you so much for coming!
Here's your, um, 3-D glasses.
 Reverend Pong will tell you when to put them on.
Hi, sweetie.
How are you holding up? Fine.
Hey, Pheebs. I'm so sorry.
You know what? My grandma had the exact same bag!
I brought you flowers.
Oh, thanks!
Pulling flowers out it makes the bag look a lot more masculine.
I'm sorry. Excuse me, is this the, uh, memorial?
Welcome.
Here's your 3-D glasses.
All right.
So how did you know Frances?
Actually, I hadn't seen her for years.
But, um, I was pretty tight with her and her daughter.
Really?! What's your name?
Frank Buffay.
Y'know what? Strike that. My name uh, actually is-is Joe.
Um, uh, Joe, uh, Hill.
You're Frank Buf... Shh. No! Joe Hill.
You just said...
I got to go. Thank you so much for coming.
But...
Oh, my God!
What happened?
That was my dad.
Oh, my God! What? Check it out!
It's like it's coming right at me.
Did you catch him? What did he say?
He said, um, "Nice to meet you, Glenda."
Well, obviously I couldn't give him my real name?
Why? Why not?
Come on, you saw the way he ran out of here!
What do you think? He's gonna stick around and talk to the daughter he abandoned!
What did you say to him?
Well, I said, I told him y'know, that I was the executor person of Francis' will and that I needed to talk to him so
I'm gonna meet him at the coffee house later.
Could everyone take their seats?
I just can't think about that now.
I want to say goodbye to my grandma. Okay.
Let's go say goodbye.
I'm off to my audition. How do I look?
I think you look great! Joey.That bag is gonna get you that part.
And a date with a man.
You know what? Make fun all you want. This is a great bag.
And it's as handy as it is becoming.
Now, Just because you don't understand something, doesn't make it wrong.
All right, So from now on you guys are gonna have to get used to the fact that Joey
...comes with a bag!
All right, I'd better go too. I have to go talk to my dad.
Ooh, Pheebs, what are you gonna say? Are you gonna tell him who you are?
Not at first. I don't want to freak him out.
But aren't you pissed at him?
This guy abandoned you.
I gotta tell you if this were me, this guy would be in some serious physical danger!
I mean I-I-I'd walk in there and I'd be like, "Yo, dad!!
You and me, outside. Right now!"
I kinda scared myself.
Well, at least you scared someone.
Y'know it's funny, you'd think I'd be angry.
I mean, you'd think I'd wanna rip his tiny little head off.
Fortunately, I'm past it.
You do seem a little tense. Here, let me help you.
Oh, get off! Ow!
Stop it! Why are you doing that to me?
What are you talking about?
As a masseuse and a human...
...I'm begging you, never do that to anyone.
I give good massages.
I used to give them to Rachel all the time before she got allergic!
And Chandler, he loves them! Watch.
He does not like it. He's in pain!
No, he's not. Yes, he is!
What? I'm sorry but, ow!
You've been lying to me?
I can't believe you'd do that.
Well, maybe he just didn't want to hurt your feelings..
But the minute we start to lie to each other...
And by "we"...
...I mean society.
Anytime you're ready.
Ahem, well, you must be new here.
Maybe we get a table, I buy you a drink.
I'm sorry, Could you try it without the purse?
Yeah, sure.
Ahem, well, you must be new here. Maybe we sit...
I'm sorry, Can I ask you something? Sure. What?
Well, first, it's not a purse.
Okay...
Anytime.
If you think it's a woman's bag, it's not.
It's a man's bag.
Okay. And go.
Let me show you the catalog.
Look. See?
Huh? It's the latest thing.
Everyone's got one. Men, women, children. Everyone's carrying them!
Do you sell these bags?
No, these babies sell themselves.
Thank you. That was great.
But I didn't read anything.
I think we've seen enough.
All right, I'll see you.
We got it. We got it.
Is Rachel here? No.
Listen, I just wanted to apologize about this afternoon and the whole massage thing.
I really like them.
Please stop.
we're supposed to be honest with each other
I-I just wish you could tell me―just say, "I don't like your massages."
I don't like your massages.
See? It's no big deal.
But now you're crying.
I'm not crying about that. I'm crying about something at work.
My boyfriend said he didn't like my massages.
You don't have to be best at everything.
Oh, my God! You don't know me at all!
Okay...
You give the worst massages in the world.
I'm crying here!
Look, hear me out.
You give the best bad massages.
If anybody was looking for the best bad massage...
and they were thinking to themselves, "Who's the best of that?"
They'd have to go to you.
So you're saying that if there was an award...
...for the best bad massage... Who would get that?
It would be you!
You, Monica! And you'd get all the votes.
So maybe they could umm, call the award the Monica?
Absolutely.
Okay...
I suck!
Thank you for meeting with me.
Thank you.
Come sit.
Sit.
Sit!
Um, alrighty. Um, before we get started, I need you...
...to state for the official record that you are, in fact, Frank Buffay.
Yes, I am. Mm-hm.
Okay. So, what did Frances leave me?
Huh? That's why you wanted me to come.
Oh, yes.
Yes, she did. She left you, um...
...this lipstick.
Oh, it's, ew, used.
Uh, cool.
Okey. I have just a few questions to ask, so I'll get out my official forms.
So question one:
You were married to Frances' daughter, Lilly. is that correct?
Yes, I was.
Okay, um, question two: Um, did that marriage end...
...A, happily...
...B, medium...
...or, C, in the total abandonment...
...of her and her two children?
It really says that?
Yeah, see?
I guess then I would have to say C.
Total abandonment.
Reasons for abandonment:
Um, A, top secret government work...
...B, amnesia...
...or, C, you're just a selfish, irresponsible...
...bad, bad man.
Y'know, I don't think I want the lipstick that much.
Would you do me a favor?
Would you give Lilly...
...that, please? What?
When you see Lilly, would you give her that, that note?
Because I wanted to talk to her at the memorial but,
well I pictured her getting mad at me the way you got mad at me and I well, I chickened out.
So, uh, I wrote her that note, would you give it to her please?
But you came to see Lilly?
Yeah. Why?
Lilly's dead.
She what?
She's dead.
Are you sure?
If she isn't, cremating her was a big mistake.
I can't believe this. I just can't believe...
How? Oh, my God.
How long ago?
Seventeen years ago.
What about the girls?
Well, Ursula is a waitress and she lives in Soho.
And Phoebe...
...is on this couch.
Yep, lipstick and a daughter. Big day for you.
Phoebe, I, um...
It's just, I don't know what to say.
I just can't believe that you're my daughter. You're so pretty.
Yes, well, that's neither here nor there.
Would it make you feel better if I said...
...that I was very, very sorry I left?
Y'know what, it doesn’t matter what you say it's not gonna make a difference anyway,
So you can just go.
Well, you know, in my defense, I was a lousy father.
That's your defense? Yes, it is.
I burned the formula, and I put your diapers on backwards.
I made up a song to sing you to sleep,, but that made you cry even more.
You make up songs?
Well, no, just that one. But it was stupid.
Let's see, how did it go? Um...
Sleepy girl, sleepy girl
Why won't you go to sleep?
Sleepy girl, sleepy girl
You're keeping me up
I'm not very good at this.
Well, I am.
Not yet. No.
Hey.
Hey! How'd the audition go?
Estelle said I didn't get it.
What? Why? Joey, you were so ready for it.
I thought so too...
...but the casting people had problems with me.
What kind of problem?
To tell you the truth...
...they had a problem with the bag! Oh, my God!
You know what? It was a stupid play anyway.
It's time to give up the bag.
I don't want to give up the bag.
I don't have to give it up, do I, Rach?
You think I should give up the bag!
Joey, I'm sorry. I mean as terrific as I think you are with it ...
...I just don't know if the world is ready for you and your bag.
I can't believe I'm hearing this!
Wait a minute! Wait a minute! I'm not saying that you shouldn’t have a bag,
I just—it's just there are other bags that are a little less umm ...
...controversial.
Yeah, um, they're called wallets.
Oh, hey, you guys, look. Ugly Naked Guy's putting stuff in boxes.
Huh. I'd say from the looks of it, our naked buddy is moving.
Ironically, most of the boxes seem to be labeled "Clothes."
Aw, I'm going to miss that big old squishy butt.
And we're done with the chicken fried rice.
Hey. Hey, if he's moving, maybe I should try to get his place.
Oh, yeah. Good idea.
It would be so cool to live across from you guys.
Yeah, hey, then we could do that telephone thing...
...you know, where you have a can, we have a can...
...and it's connected by a string.
Or we could do the actual telephone thing.
Friends  S05E14  The One Where Everyone Finds Out
Oh, my God. I love this apartment.
Isn't it perfect?
I can't believe I never realized how great it is.
That is because your eye immediately goes to the big naked man.
It's amazing.
You better hurry up and fill out an application, or I'll beat you to it.
Well, I never thought I'd say this, but I'm gonna go use Ugly Naked Guy's bathroom.
Oh, look. There's Monica and Chandler. Hey!
Hey, you guys! Hey!
Aah! Chandler and Monica. Chandler and Monica.
Oh, my God.
Chandler and Monica! Oh, my God!
Oh, my eyes! My eyes!
Phoebe. Phoebe. Ow!
It's okay. It's okay.
No, they're doing it! I know.
I know. I know. You know?
Yes, I know, and Joey knows, but Ross doesn't...
...so you have to stop screaming!
Hey, what's going on?
What? Nothing.
Oh, God, we're just so excited that you might get this apartment.
Actually, it looks really good. Aah! It looks pretty good!
Get in here! Come on!
You mean whenever Monica and Chandler were, like...
...doing laundry or going grocery shopping...?
All that time Monica spent on the phone with sad Linda from camp?
Uh-huh. Doing it, doing it, phone doing it.
I can't believe it.
I mean, I think it's great. For him.
She might be able to do better.
Hey, you guys. Joey, come here. Come here.
Phoebe just found out about Monica and Chandler.
You mean how they're friends and nothing more?
No. No, Joey, she knows.
We were at Ugly Naked Guy's apartment and saw them doing it through the window.
Actually, we saw them doing it up against the window.
Okay, so now they know you know, and they don't know Rachel knows?
Yes, but you know what? It doesn't matter who knows what.
Now enough of us know that we could just tell them we know.
Now all the lying and the secrets will finally be over.
Or we could not tell them we know and have a little fun of our own.
Well, what do you mean?
You know, every time they say they're doing laundry...
...we'll give them laundry to do.
Oh, I would enjoy that. No, no, no.
Wait, Rach, you know what would be even more fun? Telling them.
Yeah, no, I want to do Phoebe's thing. I can't take any--
You don't have to do anything. Just don't tell them that we know.
No. I can't take any more secrets.
I got your secrets, I got their secrets. I got secrets of my own, you know.
You don't have any secrets. Oh, yeah?
Well, you don't know about Hugsy, my bedtime penguin pal.
So, ahem, um...
How are we going to mess with them?
Well, you could use your position，you know,as the roommate.
And then I would use, you know, the strongest tool at my disposal.
My sexuality.
Hello, children. Hey.
Okay. Watch, learn, and don't eat my cookie.
Hey. Hey.
Ooh. Wow, that jacket looks great on you.
Really? Yeah. The material looks so soft.
Oh, hello, Mr. Bicep.
You've been working out?
Well, I try to, you know, squeeze things.
Are you okay?
Well, if you really wanna know--
Oh, I can't tell you this.
Phoebe, it's me, you can tell me anything.
Well, actually, you're the one person I can't tell this to.
And the one person I want to the most.
What's going on?
I think it's just, you know, that I haven't been with a guy in so long...
...and you know how sometimes you're looking for something...
...and you don't see that it's right there in front of you, sipping coffee...
Oh, no. Have I said too much?
Well, just something to think about. I know I will.
You are so cute. Heh.
How did you get to be so cute?
Well, my grandfather was Swedish.
And my grandmother was actually a tiny little bunny.
Okay, now you're even cuter.
You know, that is a popular opinion today, I must say.
What?
The weirdest thing happened at the coffeehouse.
I think Phoebe was hitting on me.
What are you talking about?
I'm telling you, I think Phoebe thinks I'm foxy.
It's not possible. Ow.
I'm sorry, it's just Phoebe's just always thought you were charming...
...in a sexless kind of way.
Oh, well, you know, I can't hear that enough.
I'm sorry, I just think you misunderstood her.
No, I didn't misunderstand, okay? She was all over me.
She touched my bicep, for crying out loud.
This bicep?
Well, it's not flexed right now.
Hey, Mon, what are you doing? Want to come see a movie with us?
Uh, actually, I was going to do some laundry.
Chandler, you want to do it with me? Sure, I'll do it with you.
Okay, great. Hold on a second.
Unh. Here you go.
You don't mind, do you? That would really help me out a lot. Thanks.
Ha, ha. You know what? I don't think I have enough quarters.
Oh, I have quarters.
Hey. Hey, Ross, any word on the apartment yet?
Well, I called over there, and it turns out Ugly Naked Guy is subletting it himself.
And he's already had like 100 applicants.
Oh. No, no, I've got the edge.
I know it's not exactly ethical, but I sent him a bribe...
...to tip the scales in my direction.
Yeah. Check it out, you can see it from the window.
Oh, is it that pinball machine with the big bow on it?
No.
That new mountain bike?
No.
Well, what did you send?
A basket of mini muffins.
There's a whole table of mini muffin baskets.
Which one did you send?
The small one.
What? You actually thought that basket was gonna get you the apartment?
Well, yeah.
Someone sent us a basket at work once and people went crazy over those muffins.
It was the best day.
Your work makes me sad.
Oh, man, I want that place so much.
And I was so sure that was going to work.
There's 12 bucks I'll never see again.
All right, we'd better go if we're gonna catch that movie.
Bye. Bye.
Bye, Chandler. I miss you already.
Okay, did you see that? With the inappropriate, and the pinching?
Actually, I did.
So now do you believe that she's attracted to me?
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. She knows about us.
Are you serious?
Phoebe knows, and she's just trying to freak us out.
That's the only explanation for it.
Okay, but what about my pinchable butt and my bulging biceps?
She knows.
Joey.
Yeah?
Phoebe knows about us.
Well, I didn't tell them.
Them? Who's "them"?
Uh, Phoebe and Joey.
Joey.
And Rachel.
Look, I would have told you, but they made me promise not to tell.
Oh, man. I'm sorry.
But, hey, it's over now, right?
Because you can tell them you know they know...
...and I can go back to knowing absolutely nothing.
Unless-No, not "unless." This must end now.
Oh, man, they think they are so slick messing with us.
But they don't know that we know that they know.
So. Ah, yes.
The messers become the mes-sees.
Oh, Ross, honey, you gotta stop torturing yourself.
Why don't you just find another apartment?
I've already looked at like a thousand apartments this month.
None of them even compares to that one.
You know what you should do?
You should find out what his hobbies are and then use that to bond with him.
Yeah. Like if I wanted something from Joey...
...I would strike up a conversation about, say, urn, sandwiches...
...or, uh, my underwear.
I'm listening.
See?
That is a great idea.
And I know Ugly Naked Guy because we've been watching him for five years.
So that gives me back my edge. Ha, ha.
Let's see now. He had the trampoline.
But he broke that. Well, he had gravity boots.
Yeah, he broke those too.
So he likes to break stuff.
Okay, I've got to go pick up Ben, but I will figure something out.
Hey, didn't he used to have a cat?
I wouldn't bring that up. It would probably just bum him out.
Poor cat never saw that big butt coming.
Hello?
Oh, yeah, hey. Hold on a second, she's right here.
It's Chandler.
Hello, you.
Hello, Phoebe, I've been thinking about you all day.
Well, you know that thing you said before? I'd be lying if I said I wasn't intrigued.
Really?
Yeah. Listen, Joey won't be here tonight.
Why don't you come over and I'll let you, uh, feel my bicep.
Or maybe more.
I'll have to get back to you on that. Okay, bye.
Oh, my God. He wants me to come over and feel his bicep and more.
Are you kidding? No.
I cannot believe he would do that to Mon--
Joey? Do they know that we know?
No. Joey?
They know you know. Ooh, I knew it.
Oh, I cannot believe those two.
God, they thought they can mess with us! They're trying to mess with us?! 
They don't know that we know they know we know.
And, Joey, you can't say anything.
I couldn't even if I wanted too.
Good evening, sir. My name is Ross Geller.
I'm one of the people who applied for the apartment...
...and I realize that the competition is fierce, but...
I'm sorry, I can't help but notice that you're naked and...
I applaud you-
Man, I wish I was naked.
I mean, this-this looks so great.
That is how God intended it.
Look at them. They're panicked. Oh, yeah, they're totally gonna back down.
Oh, yeah.
All right, if he wants a date, he's going to get a date.
I'm going to go in. Okay, okay.
Be sexy.
Please.
So, Chandler, I'd love to come by tonight.
Really?
Oh, absolutely. Should we say around 7?
Yes.
Good. I'm really looking forward to you and me having sexual intercourse.
Hey, hey, check it out, check it out. Ugly Naked Guy's got a naked friend.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, my God. That's our friend.
It's Naked Ross. It is Ross!
Showtime.
Okay, Rachel, get me perfume.
And, Joey, could't you get me a bottle of wine and glasses?
All right, it'll be great.
You just make her think you want to have sex with her and it'll freak her out.
Okay, listen, how far am I gonna have to go with her?
Relax, she's gonna give in way before you do.
How do you know? Because you're on my team.
And my team always wins.
At this?
Just go get some. Go.
Okay, honey, now, I'm gonna try to listen from right here.
Okay. Okay. Oh, wait.
Good idea. Yeah.
Don't give away the farm. Okay.
Phoebe.
Chandler. Come on in.
I was going to.
Um, I brought some wine. Would you like some?
Sure.
So here we are. Nervous?
Me? No. You?
No. I want this to happen.
So do I.
I'm going to put on some music.
Maybe-Maybe I'll dance for you.
You look good.
Thanks. Heh.
You know, when you say things like that, it makes me wanna...
...rip that sweater vest right off.
Well, why don't we move this into the bedroom?
Really? Oh, do you not want to?
No. No.
I just, you know, first, I wanna take off all my clothes...
...and have you rub lotion on me.
Well, that would be nice.
I'll go get the lotion.
This is totally getting out of hand, okay? She wants me to put lotion on her.
She's bluffing. Look, she's not backing down.
She went like this--
He's not backing down. He went to get lotion.
Oh, man, aren't you guys done yet?
I want to sit in my chair.
Joey, look at it this way, the sooner Phoebe breaks Chandler...
...the sooner this is all over and out in the open.
Ooh, I like that.
Oh, okay. Show him your bra. He's afraid of bras. Can't work them.
Joey!
Wow, you didn't rip off any buttons.
It's not my first time.
You go back out there and you seduce her till she cracks.
Okay. Give me a second.
Did you clean up in here? Of course.
Oh, you're, uh-You're going?
Um, not without you, lover.
So this is my bra.
It's very, very nice.
Well, come here.
I'm very happy we're gonna have all the sex.
You should be. I'm very bendy.
I'm gonna kiss you now. Not if I kiss you first.
Well, I guess there's nothing left for us to do but kiss.
Here it comes.
Our first kiss.
Okay, okay, okay. You win.
Ha! I can't have sex with you.
And why not? Because I'm in love with Monica.
You're-You're what?
Love her. That's right. I love her.
I love her.
I love you, Monica.
I love you too, Chandler.
I just thought you guys were doing it. I didn't know you were in love.
Dude.
Hats off to Phoebe. Quite a competitor.
And may I say your breasts are still showing?
God.
All right. So that's it?
It's over. Everybody knows.
Well, actually, Ross doesn't.
Yes, and we'd appreciate it if no one told him yet.
A new place for a new Ross.
I'm gonna have you and all the guys from work over...
...once it's, you know, furnished.
I must say, it's nice to see you back on your feet.
Well, I am that, uh, and the whole rage thing is definitely behind me.
I wonder if it's time for you to rejoin our team at the museum.
Oh, Donald, that would be great.
I am totally ready to come back to work. l__
What? No.
What are you doing?
Get off my sister!
Chandler! Chandler!
Chandler! I saw what you were doing through the window.
I saw what you were doing to my sister, now, get out here!
Well, listen, we had a good run.
You know? What was it? Four, five months?
I mean, that's more than most people have in a lifetime.
So goodbye, take care, bye-bye then.
What are you doing? Oh, I'm going on the lam.
Come on, Chandler. Come on. I can handle Ross.
Hold on.
Hey, Ross. What's up, bro?
What the hell are you doing?
Hey, what's going on?
Well, I think-I think Ross knows about me and Monica.
Dude, he's right there.
I thought you were my best friend. This is my sister.
My best friend and my sister. I cannot believe this.
We're not just messing around. I love her.
Okay? I'm in love with her.
I'm so sorry that you had to find out this way.
I'm sorry, but it's true. I love him too.
My best friend and my sister.
I cannot believe this.
You guys want to probably get some hugs in too, huh? Big news.
Oh, no, that's okay. We've actually known for a while.
What? What? You guys knew?
You all knew and you didn't tell me?
Well, Ross, we were worried about you,okay?
We didn't know how you were going to react.
You were worried about me?
You didn't know how I was gonna react?
Okay. All right. Whew.
What do you say we all, uh, clear out of here...
...and let these two love birds get back down to business.
Hey, hey, hey. I'm just talking here. He's the one doing your sister.
Friends  S05E15 The One With The Girl Who Hits Joey
Hey, you know what I just realized?
If you guys ever have kids-Whoa, whoa, whoa. We're having kids?
I call godfather.
You can't just call godfather.
Don't you think her brother should be godfather?
Sure. If you cared enough to call it first.
Guys, you're a few steps ahead of us. Yeah, big zero-gravity moon steps.
Oh, oh, I just thought of the greatest wedding gift to get you.
Oh, I'll go in on that with you. I couldn't think of anything.
Hey, Katie.
Hey, everyone, this is Katie. Hi.
Hi. You ready to go?
Yeah, just gotta run to the bathroom. Oh sure, right back there.
Hey, where are we going to lunch? I was thinking maybe Chinese food.
I love Chinese.
How did you know I love Chinese?
She is so cute.
You could fit her right in your little pocket.
I don't know. I mean, I like her a lot, and she's really nice, but...
But what?
She keeps punching me.
In the cute little, sweet way she just did?
Hey, it's a lot harder than it looks, okay?
She-she-she's hurting me.
I know what you need. You need a bodyguard.
Hey, Ross, what is Ben doing after preschool?
Okay, come on, Joey is having a problem. There's a little girl who's beating him up.
Aw, Joey, come here. Look.
Honey, I know. This must be really, really difficult for you, and--
Oh, I'm sorry, am I hurting you?
Hey. Hey.
I brought you some housewarming gifts. Oh.
Salt, so your life always has flavor. Ah.
Bread, so you never go hungry. Oh.
And a scented candle for the bathroom.
Because, well, you know.
Well, thanks. Thanks. And thanks, I guess.
Hi. Welcome to the building. I'm Steve Cera, President of the tenants' committee.
Oh, hi. Ross Geller. And, uh, this is my friend Phoebe.
Hi, Phoebe. Mr. President.
I, uh, came to talk to you about Howard.
Howard?
Yeah, he's the handyman. He's gonna be retiring next week...
...and everyone who lives here is kicking in a hundred bucks...
...as a "thank you for all the hard work" type of thing.
Oh, that's nice. Yeah.
So you want to give me a check, or...?
You don't have to give it to me now. You can slip it under my door.
No, no, it's not that. It's just-I just moved in.
Well, the guy's worked here for 25 years.
Yes, but I've lived here for 25 minutes.
Oh.
Okay, I get it.
No wait, look. Look! I'm sorry, it's just I've never even met Howard.
I mean, I don't know Howard.
Howard's the handyman.
Yes, but to me he's just "man."
Okay. Fine. Whatever.
Welcome to the building.
Can you believe that guy?
Yeah. I really like his glasses.
So then President Steve told everyone I was a Cheapskate...
...and now the whole building hates me.
A little kid spit on my knee.
You know what? I'm gonna throw a party. That's right, for everyone in the building.
And I'm gonna sit them all down and explain to them that I am not a bad guy.
I am not a cheap guy. I'm just a guy...
...who stands up for what he believes in.
A man with principles.
Sounds like a fun party. Mm.
Look, Ross, if you want your neighbors to like you...
...why don't you just pay the hundred bucks?
A party's gonna cost you way more. That doesn't matter.
It's my principles. We're talking about my principles.
Okay, I thought it was about your neighbors liking you.
Oh, they'll like me once they come to my awesome par-tay.
Okay, I gotta run. I gotta go get some nametags.
And that crazy party animal will be your brother-in-law.
Very, very funny. But don't say things like that in from of Monica.
I don't want you putting any ideas in her head.
Um, Chandler, you do realize that those ideas...
...are probably already in Monica's head?
Why?
Well, because she loves you and because you love her.
Yeah, so? What's that supposed to mean?
Hey, Chandler, don't freak out. I'm telling you something you already know.
Come on. She broke up with Richard because he didn't want to have babies.
And she's a woman, and she's almost 30, and, you know, it's Monica.
I don't see it that way. Okay? I see two Monicas:
The one that was my friend who lives across the hall and wanted a lot of babies.
And the new Monica who I started to date. Now, who is to say what she wants?
I'm right. I'm right. Am I right?
Yeah, you're right.
You are absolutely right. I mean, that makes everything different.
0key.
It's not different, is it?
Not unless "different" means the same.
You were so funny with that waiter. You're such a nut.
You know, breads-tick fangs are always funny.
No, you make them funny. You're the funny one.
Uh, look, Katie, uh, listen, we need to talk, okay?
Um, look, I like you. I really do. I like you a lot, okay?
But sometimes when you playfully punch me like that...
...it feels like someone's hitting me with a very tiny, but a very real bat.
Oh. Like I could hurt you.
Are you making fun of my size? No.
Don't make fun of me because of my size.
Isn't this great? Mm.
Couldn't you just stay like this forever?
Chandler?
Couldn't you just stay here forever?
Yeah, here, somewhere else. You know, wherever. Ha, ha.
Are you okay? Yeah. I'm cool.
Casual.
What are you doing?
Just hanging out. Having fun, you know, uh, with the girl that I'm seeing casually.
Man, I knew it. I knew you were going to do this.
What?
Get all freaked out because everybody was joking around about marriage.
Well, you do want all that stuff, right?
And you know what I want?
Yes. You want babies. You have baby fever.
I do not have baby fever.
Oh, please. You are obsessed with babies and marriage...
...and everything that's related to babies and marriage.
You know what? Why don't we turn the heat down on this pressure cooker?
Have you lost your mind?
Chandler, this isn't about me.
This is about you and all your weird relationship commitment crap.
Uh-uh. I know you, okay? I know the thoughts that you have in your head.
Well, you don't know everything.
Did you know I'm going outwith Rachel tonight instead of you? Hmm?
And that the only baby around here is you?
And did you know I can't even look at you right now?
Yeah, well, I did not know that.
It's gonna be okay, right? I mean, she's not gonna leave me. This is fixable.
Yeah, sure. Absolutely.
By me? Oh, no, no, no.
Well, unless you make some kind of big gesture.
Yeah, big, though.
Shh. The missus.
Gunther, can I get a coffee?
To go.
Monica--
I'm still not done not wanting to talk to you.
Just tell me what I need to do to make things right.
What? That's what we do.
I mess up, you tell me how to fix it and I do.
And then, you know, you think I'm all cute again.
I'm really tired of being your relationship tutor.
You're gonna have to figure this out for yourself.
You know what? If you're too afraid to be in a real relationship...
...then don't be in one.
Phoebe.Phoebe.
Oh, hi, Ross.
What are you doing here?
Oh, I thought this was your party, and it turns out it's a party for Howard.
He's the sweetest little man.
See you, Phoebe. Oh, and, hey, thanks for chipping in.
Oh, sure.
You chipped in?
Yeah, uh-huh, hundred dollars.
Phoebe, I can't believe you gave him money.
I thought you agreed it was unreasonable that they asked me for that money.
Yeah, but they didn't ask me, you know?
This way I'm just, you know, the exotic, generous stranger.
That's always fun to be.
Yeah, but you're making me look bad.
No, I'm not. No, if anything, I'm making you look better.
They'll see you talking to me, and I'm a hit.
Hey, Pheebs. Hey.
Oh, hey, Ross.
Urn, say, I was thinking maybe you two could switch apartments.
Because Phoebe is more our kind of people.
Something to think about it.
Yeah, okay, my bad.
Hey. Hi.
Wow. You look big.
Thanks, I've been working out.
Hey, listen, is it obvious I'm wearing six sweaters?
Uh,yeah.
But it's not obvious why.
Well, look, I'm breaking up with Katie, so I had to put on some extra padding.
You know, I mean, if she hits me when she's happy...
...can you imagine how hard she's gonna hit me...
...when I tell her I'm taking away the Joey love?
Hey.
Hey. Hey, cute jacket.
Oh, thanks.
That's so sweet. Whoa. Ow.
Oh, "OW."
Did Joey tell you to say that? You guys are too much.
You know what? I gotta tell you...
...I think you're the one that is too much.
Joey has the nicest friends.
And the nicest girlfriend.
You're so sweet.
You're so sweet. Ow!
Joey?
She just kicked me.
Well, aren't you gonna do something?
You better do something or I'm gonna walk out that door right now.
Well, are you gonna?
Nah.
Phoebe? Ha, ha. That's what I was saying.
Phoebe? Phoebe?
This is a disaster. Can't I please just go?
No. no. I'm talking you up to people.
Just give it a little time, all right? Relax. Get something to eat.Okey.
So, uh, what did you tell them about me?
Um, I told them about you and Emily. You know, trying to get some sympathy.
But somehow you came off as the bad guy.
What? Yeah, I think I told it wrong.
We should talk about that...
...because I don't totally understand what happened there.
Oh. This cake is really good.
Okay, see? Things are looking up already.
Oh, my God. Someone cut Howard's cake.
Who would do a thing like that?
3-B.
Okay, you got your free food, you ruined everyone's fun.
Don't you think it's time you went home? Yeah.
Yeah, go back to 3-B, 3-B.
All right, everyone, calm down. Everyone, calm down.
I have something that I would like to say.
Who here likes Ross?
Of course you don't like him.
He didn't give you any money.
He raised his own hand when I asked, "Who here likes Ross?"
And he's wearing two nametags.
I'll be honest with you guys. When I first met Ross, I didn't like him at all.
But then once I got to know him, I saw that he's really sweet...
...and caring and very generous.
I mean, all I'm saying is don'tjudge Ross before you get to know him, all right?
You know, I like all of you guys now. But when I first met you, you know...
Kurt? I thought, you know, abrasive drunk.
Um, Lola, mind-numbingly stupid.
And, okay, you guys: Gold digger, cradle-robbing perv.
So I think you all know what I mean.
Obviously, I didn't think they were gonna start throwing things.
I just thought if I kept insulting them you would jump in and defend everyone.
Then you could look like the hero.
Oh, wow, yeah.
See, I did not get that.
Where's Monica? Where is she? I need to talk to her, it's urgent. Is she here?
I'm Monica. I need to talk to you. It's urgent.
Okay. Okay, I've been doing a lot of thinking...
...about us. You know, a lot of, uh, "us" thinking.
And, uh, well, I guess there's only one way to do this.
Wait, wait. What are you doing? Monica--
No, no, no. Don't do it.
Will you marry me?
Oh, no, no, no. What a bad idea.
Oh, I can't not look at it.
Chandler, why are you doing this?
I don't know.
But I know I'm not afraid to do this.
Chandler.
I'm doing this because I'm sorry?
Do you, urn, really think the best reason to get married is because you're sorry?
Oh, no, the best reason to get married is pregnancy.
Sorry is pretty much fourth, behind being ready and actually wanting to get married.
Will you be my wife?
Chandler, um, I want you to take just a minute...
...and I want you to think about how ridiculous this sounds.
Yeah, I'm kind of wishing everyone wasn't here right now.
You know that none of that stuff came from me.
I mean, I never said that I wanted to have babies and get married right now.
Yeah, I know, I was really confused, and then I talked to these guys.
Who? Two divorces and Joey?
Hey. She's right, you know.
Yeah, but still, cheap shot.
You know when I said that I want you...
...to deal with relationship stuff all on your own?
Well, you're not ready for that. I didn't think I was.
Oh, my God.
What would you have done if I had said yes?
Well, I would've been happy because...
...I would have been able spend the rest of my life with the woman I love.
Or you would have seen a Chandler-shaped hole in that door.
Hey, Ross, will you pass me that knife? No, I will not.
It's okay. You don't have to be so mean about it.
You're right. I'm sorry. Will you marry me?
Oh, and I was going to ask you to marry me...
...because I forgot to say hello to you last week.
Oh, no, wait, Pheebs. I think with something like that...
...you just ask them to move in with you. But I'm not sure. Chandler?
Ha, ha, okay, how long is this gonna go on?
Well, I think the length of teasing...
...is directly related to how insane you were.
So a long time.
This is fun. Oh, hey, Rach, remember that whole "we were on a break" thing?
Well, I'm sorry, will you marry me'?
That's not funny.
Hey. Hey.
What are you guys doing up? We wanted to finish the crossword before bed.
Do you know a six-letter word for "red"?
Dark-red.
I think that's wrong, but there's a connect-the-dots in here for you later.
Hey, how, uh, about maroon?
Yes! You are so smart! Ha-ha-ha.
Aw.
You guys are so cute.
I know.
All right. I'll see you in the morning.
Okay.
You know, I love doing crossword puzzles with you, honey.
Oh, me too.
Now, let's finish this and go to bed. Okay.
There's only one left.
Three-letter word. Not dog, but...
Cat.
Yes. Ha.
You are so smart!
I love you.
I love you too.
Friends  S05E16  The One With A Cop
We still need a tip.
All right. Hold on.
I got it.
Nickel.
How much more do we need? A couple of bucks.
Okay, dime.
You guys should probably keep talking. This could take a while.
Wait, lookit!
Whoa!
Oh, my God. This is a police badge!
 Oh that's so cool! Why would a cop come in here though? They don't serve donuts. Ha.
Y'know what actually, could you discover the badge again?
I think I can come up with something better than that.
Phoebe, I bet somebody's missing that badge.
Yeah, I should take it back. Ooh,  but you know what? While I'm at the police station, ...
...I could check their Ten Most Wanted list.
because my friend Fritzi's been Number 11 forever. so this could be her year! 
Hey, you guys. Hey, Joey.
Hey. Hey.
Hey. That uh, that my sweatshirt?
Yes, it is. I'm sorry. I borrowed it. I was cold. I hope it's okay.
It's just that, uh, if you wear someone's sweatshirt...
...shouldn't it be your boyfriend's?
And I'm not him.
I'm sorry. I'll give it back.
No, no. No.
I mean it's gonna be all smelling like Monica!
Are you saying I smell bad?
No. No.
You smell like a meadow.
I'm sorry.
What's with him?
Oh, y'know what? The last time Joey went to a meadow, his mother was shot by a hunter.
Yeah, I still don't know.
I'm sorry I just wanna make sure that I bought the right couch. I need a couch that says:
"Kids welcome here," but that also says
"Come here to me."
What? You say that to kids?
No, no, no.
The "Come here to me" is, you know, for the ladies.
Ross, honey, it's a nice couch, not a magic couch.
Well, you picked a great couch.
Yeah? Yeah.
Yeah. Could you just sign right here please? Oh, sure.
Oh, what's, heh--?
The delivery charge is almost as much as the couch!
That's ridiculous. He lives three blocks away.
You know what? I'll take it myself. Thank you.
All right, Rash, come on. Let's go.
Yeah.
Are you kidding?
Come on. It's only three blocks. Uh, it's not very heavy. Try it. Come on! Come on!
Oh, I can do it. Yeah.
You two will really enjoy that couch.
We're, uh, not together.
Oh, okay. Yeah. Ha-ha-ha.
Something didn't quite add up there.
Ross.
What's that supposed to mean? Ross.
Well, you. Her. Heh.
I mean, she's very...
...you know.
And you're, like...
"NQU know'?
Not that it's any of your business, but we did go out.
Really? You two?
Yeah. Rash'?
Come on, I don't really want to be doing this right now. I am carrying a very heavy couch.
Then tell him quickly.
Fine. We went out.
Not only did we go out...
...we did it 298 times!
Ross.
Oh, WV"
Ugh, you kept count? You are such a loser!
A loser you did it with 298 times!
Oh. Oh!
Excuse me, ma'am. You can't put your cigarette out on a tree.
Yeah, I can. It worked well.
But you shouldn't. So don't ever do that again.
I won't till I have my next cigarette.
Hold it!
NYPD. Freeze, punk!
What?
That's right. You are so busted.
Book 'em.
Who are you talking to? Save it, red!
Unless you want to spend the night in the slammer, you apologize to the tree.
I am not going to apologize to a tree.
You apologize to the tree right now, or I am calling for backup.
Backup! Backup!
I'm sorry! Sorry!
Okay, cancel backup! Cancel backup!
Okay.
Ross, didn't you say that there was an elevator in here?
Uhh, yes I did but there isn't. Okay, here we go.
Okay, go left.
Left. Left.
Okay, you know what? There is no more left, left!
Oh okay, y'know lift it straight up over your head!
Straight up over your head. You can do it!
You can do it!
Okay. You got it? Yeah.
Go, go. Good, good.
You got it, right? You got it, right? You got--
Any chance you think the couch looks good there?
...so this guy was all...
And I'm all, "Buffay! Homicide!"
It was just so cool! Ha-ha-ha.
Phoebe, you were supposed to take that back.
I know, but I'm having so much fun doing good deeds.
Okay, but impersonating a police officer is a serious thing. You can get arrested.
You could get arrested right now!
All right, yeah, I'd better take it back. I'm totally drunk with power.
Hey. Hey.
Hi, Joe.
Yeah. I didn't know you guys were gonna be here.
Hey Joey, do me a favor, sweetie. Taste this. What? Why?
What is going on with you? Nothing.
Oh, come on! You've been acting strange all day.
All right. There is something. I, uh...
I kind of had a dream.
But I don't want to talk about it.
Oh, whoa. What if Martin Luther King had said that?
I kind of have a dream.
I don't want to talk about it.
Look, it involved Monica.
You had a dream about a girl I'm seeing? Oh, that is so cool.
I can't tell you how many times I dreamt about a girl he was seeing.
Anyway, we were talking about your dream. I love you. Your dream?
Don't worry, there wasn't any sex in it. I haven't dreamt about her like that...
...since I found out about you two-ish.
What was the dream about?
Well, okay.
You were my girlfriend. We were doing the crossword puzzle.
Y'know like you guys were doing last night.
So that's it. I'm in love with Monica and I'll be moving out.
Wait, Joey, come on. That doesn't mean that you're in love with me.
It doesn't?
It could mean anything. Like, uh...
...all of a sudden you're jealous that I've become the apartment stud.
That kinda sounds like your dream, dude.
Or it could mean you saw Chandler and me together, and we y'know were being close and stuff...
...and then you just want to have that with someone too.
In the dream I did enjoy the closeness.
Okay, look.
Are you attracted to Monica?
Right here, right now, are you attracted to her?
Not really. There you have it!
Heh. Well, sure! I'm just wearing sweats!
But that's good!
You're not in love with me. because you just want a girlfriend!
No, I don't think it's just about getting a girlfriend.
Yeah, Y'know? I mean, I could get a girlfriend.
Yeah, we could sit in the chair and do crossword puzzles.
But y'know are we ever gonna have y'know the closeness like you guys have?
Monica and I were friends before we started dating. Maybe that's it.
Friends first?
That's interesting.
You become friends after? No, never done that either.
Um, do you guys have a tape measure?
Oh, yeah. It's actually in my bedroom.
That's right.
What's up, Joey?
How you doing?
Excuse me. Is this your car? Yeah.
Well, I don't think it's nice of you to park here. You're blocking the entrance.
Don't worry about it. It's not a problem.
It's a problem for me, which means it's a problem for you because I'm a cop.
So am I.
Oh, no.
Oh, okay. so you're a cop which means you can park anywhere,
'cause I know that 'cause I'm a cop too. 
So, all right, keep up the good work. Ten-four.
Hey, wait a second! So wait, what precinct are you with?
I'm with the, um, the 57th.
I know a guy in Homicide up there. I'm in Vice.
Yeah, In fact, I'm undercover right now. I'm a whore.
Who else is in Vice up there?
Um, do you know, um...
...Sipowitz?
Sipowitz? No, I don't think so.
Yeah. Sipowitz. Yeah. Big guy, kind of bald.
I don't know him.
Don't try to call him or anything. Because he's not there. He's out.
His, um, partnerjust died.
Tell Sipowitz I'm real sorry for his loss.
I sure will. Take care.
Hey, by the way, I'm sure Sipowitz is gonna be all right.
I heard that kid from Silver Spoons is really good.
And where did you find my badge?
Hey, Joey, would you mind giving me and Ross a hand moving his couch?
Aw, I'd love to but I got acting class. But you know what?
I guess I could blow that off for you.
Thanks.
Uh, hey, Rach let me ask you something.Uh, I was just over there talking to Monica and Chandler, 
Boy, they are really tight.
I know.
Yeah that's not such a bad situation they got going over there. 
I'm thinking of getting me one of those.
What's up, Joe?
The reason I think Monica and Chandler are so great...
...is because they were friends first, you know?
So I asked myself, who are my friends? You and Phoebe.
I saw you first, so...
What are you saying? I'm saying maybe you and I crank it up a notch.
You know, honey, um...
..as, uh, flattered as I am...
...that you saw me first...
...uhh, I just, I-I don't think we should be cranking anything up.
I'll treat you real nice.
Yeah. Well, you know, um...
Listen, I think it's a great idea to become friends with someone before you date.
But I think the way you do it is you meet someone, become their friend...
...build a foundation, then ask them out on a date.
Don't hit on your existing friends.
Won't that take longer?
Yeah. Yeah.
Oh, but once you find it...
...it's so worth the wait.
Yeah.
I understand. I understand.
Good.
Man, I wish I saw Phoebe first.
Come here to me.
No, no. You come here to me.
Hey, Ross.
Ahem, I brought reinforcements. Oh, great! You brought Joey?
 Well, I brought the next best thing. Heh.
Hey-
Chandler?!  You brought Chandler? The next best thing would be Monica!
Y'know, I would be offended, but Monica is freakishly strong...
Look, I drew a sketch of how we'll do it.
Okay ,Rach, that's you.
That's the couch.
Oh, what's that?
Oh, that's me.
 You certainly think a lot of yourself.
No. That's my arm.
Oh, I see. I thought you just really, really liked your new couch.
Just follow my lead.
0key.
Come on, Chandler.
All right. Okay.
Here we go.
All right. Ready?
Turn! Okay.
Turn!
Turn!
I don't think we can turn anymore! I don't think it'll fit!
Yeah, it will. Come on! Up, up, up!
UP! Yes!
Here we go! Pivot!
Pivot!
Pivot!
Pivot!
Pivot!
Pivot!
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!
I don't think it's gonna pivot anymore.
You think?
All right, let's, uh, bring it back down and try again.
I think it's really stuck now.
I can't believe that didn't work. I know. Me neither.
I mean, you had a sketch.
What did you mean when you said "pivot"?
Hey. Hey.
How's it going? Did you make any new friends?
Yeah. I met this woman.
Hey. Whoa, whoa.
What's she like?
Uh, well, she's...
...really good in bed.
Joey, I thought you were going to try to be friends first.
Well look, hey, it's all your fault. What? Why?
Well because you didn't give me advice. No! You gave me a pickup line.
As soon as I told her I wanted to y'know, "build a foundation and be friends first."
I suddenly, through no fault of my own, I became irresistible to her!
And her roommate!
What about the "closeness"?
Closeness, schmosness! There was three of us, for crying out loud!
All right! Hey, Who wants pizza?
I do! I do! I do!
Oh, great! Can you believe I found this on the second floor?
Who is it? NYPD.
Oh, my God! Oh, my God.
Uh, just a minute, officer!
I'm looking for Phoebe Buff ay. My God, it's him! It's that cop!
I can't believe he found me! Oh my God, Phoebe,Are you going to go to jail?
Well, If I'm going down, you guys are going down with me.
Harboring a fugitive? That's one-to-three years minimum.
Good luck, Chandler.
Okay, you can arrest me, Fine. but you'll never make it stick and you know it.
Yeah, but I kinda don't have a choice, it's my job. You understand, right?
Yeah, as long as you understand that I'm gonna call my lawyer.
And once he puts you on the stand, he's gonna make you look like a fool! Like a fool!
I don't like looking foolish.
Y'know what? Maybe, uh, I don't arrest you today. Maybe I came by and you weren't here.
I would love it if I weren't here!
Okay, so since umm, you're not going to jail tonight, I was wondering if you'd, um...
...like to go to dinner with me?
Me? Yeah.
Ever since you flashed my badge at me, I kind of can't stop thinking about you.
You're the prettiest fake undercover whore I've ever seen.
Nice.
Wow, I didn't see that coming. You're asking me out.
Yeah, I could've done it better, but these people keep staring at me.
Um, yeah, I'd like to go out with you, officer.
Gary. Gary.
Okay, so it's a date. Yeah.
Yeah! So--ooh, I gotta ask you, though. How did you know where to find me?
Your fingerprints were all over my badge so I ran them through the computer.
This was listed as your last known address so I checked it out.
Oh, impressive.
Not as impressive as you. I looked at your record and you've done some weird stuff.
We'll talk at dinner.
0key.
So I'll come by in a couple hours and pick you up?
All right, I can't wait. Okay.
Don't worry, I won't just take you out for doughnuts.
He has a gun!
I'd like to return this couch. I'm not satisfied with it.
You want to return this couch?
It's cut in half.
That's what I'm telling you. Did you out this couch in half?
This couch is cut in half!
I would like to exchange it for one that is not cut in half.
You're telling me this couch was delivered to you like this?
Look, I'm a reasonable man.
I will accept store credit.
I'll give you store credit in the amount of $4.
I Will take it.
Good! You guys are all here. Hey, what's up?
Well, I have a job interview at Ralph Lauren tomorrow.
Oh! Congratulations!
Oh, boy. That guy's underwear sucks!
What? Well, I got this pair marked "XS."
Let me tell you, there was no room for excess anything in there.
Anyway, I'm gonna be the coordinator of the women's collection.
I'll work right under the director. It's the perfect job for me.
Wow. Well, if you nail the interview, you'll get it.
Yeah. Want to work on your interview skills?
Okay! Okay!
Let's start with the handshake.
Hi. Hi.
Very good handshake. Good wrist action. Thank you.
Let me try. Okey.
Oh, my God! What did I ever do to you?
Did I squeeze too hard?
Let's just say I'm glad I'm not Chandler.
Friends  S05E17 The One With Rachel's Inadvertant Kiss
That's right, Ross. I can see you in your new apartment.
And you can see me!
Same as yesterday, same as the day before.
Is he doing his "shark attack" bit yet?
No. Oh, wait! There he goes.
Very funny, Ross.
Very lifelike and funny. Okay.
Oh, no, no, no. I wasn't waving at you, lady.
Whoa, maybe I was.
Hey! Monica, this hot girl in Ross' building is flirting with me.
Get in there, man. Flirt back. Mix it up!
Yeah, I'm down with that.
Okay, here it goes.
How...
...you...
...doing?
It worked! She's waving me over.
I'll be right over
.Let's see, she's on the third floor...
She is pretty, huh? Tell me about it, huh?
Oh, no, no. No, no! I'm not with her.
Oh, that's just Monica.
Hey, Joey!
Great stuff, huh?
This is your place?
Yeah, of course it is. Oh, come on in. Ooh, ohh. Uh, 
go by the window. You can pretend to be surfing.
But I counted. You're not supposed to live here.
Oh, man!
Unh! What happened?
I ended up at Ross' place. I must have miscounted or something.
Damn! She's not there anymore.
Oh, look, Ross is doing his "watching TV" bit.
No, Joe, I think he's just watching TV.
We've lost visual contact with the suspect.
Okay, now I really have to go.
It's so unfair that our date has to get cut short...
...just because some guy shot at a store clerk.
I know, but it's my job. Then maybe I could come too?
Suspect has just emerged naked from the sewer.
All right, you go.
Bye-bye. Okay. Bye.
Oh, God! What?
Oh, I just miss him so much!
For just a week you guys are really close, huh?
Yeah, it's weird. I can't help it, though. He's so sweet.
He's like this little puppy dog, you know?
But like a really tough one who shoots bad guys.
Ugh, I just love the beginning parts of relationships, you know?
You can't keep your hands off each other.
I know. It is the best. Ha, ha. Ha, ha.
So-so how long did that last for you and Chandler?
What? It's still going on.
Come on, seriously. When did it end?
I am serious. We're all over each other all the time.
Okay, you know where you are better than I do. I was just curious.
Why don't you just calm down, Phoebe, all right?
Why don't you just get all your facts before you run around telling everybody that you're the only hot couple!!
God, I woke the beast. Um...
I was wrong obviously. I just misspoke. It's okay.
Well, it is okay. I mean...
As long as you know Chandler and I are also hot and fiery.
I mean, just as hot as you.
I mean, our flame...
Whoo! It is on fire!
Monica, here's your broom back.
You are so cute.
Oh, hey! How'd the interview go? Ugh!
Horrible! I did the stupidest, most embarrassing thing.
Did you tell the guy you wanted to have sex with his wife then fall off your chair?
No. So, what happened?
Ugh, it was horrible! And the interview part went so well.
You know, like, I even made him laugh.
He said something about a boat...
...and I was like, "Well, yeah, if you've got enough life jackets."
Trust me. It was actually very funny.
Anyway, so we were saying goodbye and, uh... Ugh.
What happened?.
All right, we were shaking hands..
...and he kind of leaned in toward me.
Maybe he was going to open the door.
But I totally misread him and I, uh...
You kissed him?
I didn't know what else to do!
Well, you could have tried...
...not kissing him.
Thanks, Chandler.
Hey, Rach, a guy from Ralph Lauren called. You got a second interview.
I can't believe it! I got a second interview. Yes!
That kiss isn't looking like such a mistake now, is it?
Wait a minute, wait. You don't think that's why he wants me back?
Yeah!
No?
Kiss? What are you talking about?
Ugh, I accidentally kissed him in the interview...
...and now he wants me back y'know of course...
...because, "Let's bring back the girl who kisses everybody"!
Come on, Rach.
Oh my God! What if he thinks I'm the kind of girl that'll just sleep with him?
He probably wants you back because you're right for the job.
Maybe. I don't know. Oh, God! How could I be so stupid?
Oh, Rachel, look, don't say that.I think you just need a hug from Joey. Heh.
Come on. Come on, ha-ha-ha.
She's back! Hot girl's back!
Aw, well, I'm not totally back yet. but thank you.
No, in Ross' building. She's back! She's back!
Okay, wait there. I'll be over in a second.
One, two, three. Got it!
I gotta check out this hot girl.
There she is!
Damn it! Did you move?
Yes.
I lived with you guys for a while. Then I found this place.
I'm Ross.
Yes?
Do you happen to have a hot girl in there?
No, I'm all alone.
Yeah. Sorry about that.
Oh. Hey, little girl.
Is your mommy or sister or babysitter by any chance, a hot girl?
Daddy! Later, girl! Aah.
Oh, man!
Hot girl?
Hot girl!
Hi, Rachel. Come on in. Hi. Okay.
Ahem. It's nice to see you again. Thank you.
Oh, Rachel, uh...
What? .
Just, uh..
Excuse me? Yeah, let me...
Whoa, eh, oh!All right. Okay, I see what's going on here. Now, listen, look...
...I am sorry if I gave you the wrong impression.
But I am not some hussy who will just sleep around to get ahead.
Even though I kissed you, that does not give you...
...the right to demand sex from me! I do not want this job that bad.
Good day, sir.
Ugh, you are not gonna believe...
...what that sleazeball from Ralph Lauren did to me.
Okay, that's amazing. How did you know that?
You got ink on your lip.
Oh.
What do you say, maybe, sometime I hold your gun?
I don't know. We're not supposed to do that.
What could happen? I mean...
Yeah. I'm gonna say no.
Phoebe, do you want to see a movie after dinner tonight? Oh, we can't. We already have plans.
What are you doing?
Um, well, same thing we did all day. Just hang out at Gary's apartment.
He is so amazing. We never left the bedroom.
But have fun at the movie.
Uh, ha, ha. Well, we're not seeing a movie.
You're not? Why did you ask us if we wanted to go?
Oh, um, because I just wanted to know what you were doing...
...so y'know walk in on me and Chandler...
...while we were, y'know,doing it all night.
Will you excuse me just a second? Okay. Yeah.
Chandler? Can I see you for a second? Uh, yeah.
We have got to beat them! Why?
Because Gary and Phoebe think they're a hotter couple than we are.
Oh! So? So?
So! So we've got to go upstairs and have a lot of sex to prove them wrong!
Monica, you have got to stop this competitive thing. It's crazy.
Just to impress Gary and Phoebe.you want me to go upstairs and have sex over and over.
...and I'm saying no to this why? Get your coat!
Hey. Hi.
Excuse me.
You should check this out. Tell the other tenants.
Apparently, he's running around looking for some kind of hot girl.
Who isn't?
I don't think we've met. I'm Ross.
I know. You're the guy who wouldn't chip in for the handyman.
Never mind.
No, I actually thought it was unfair the way everyone reacted.
I mean, you had just moved in.
I had just moved in!
Thank you!
Listen, um...
Jen. Jen.
I know this may sound a little:
But, uh, would you want to grab a cup of coffee sometime?
Sure, that would be nice.
My number's on there. Give me a call.
I will give you a call. Heh.
I'll see you later. Okay.
I forgot my paper.
That was amazing. Ugh.
Phoebe and Gary are so gonna hear about this at dinner.
That was amazing.
We are the hottest, huh?
No one is hotter than we are.
We're the best. No, you're the best.
No, you're the best. No, you're the best.
I am the best.
Hey, guys.
What you been doing?
Hey, Joey, isn't that the girl who waved at you the other day?
I don't know, but I can see through your sheet.
Yeah. Yeah, that's her.
But you know what? It doesn't matter.I'm never gonna meet her anyways. Why?
Because it's impossible to find her apartment!
She lives in some hot-girl parallel universe or something.
What are you talking about?
She lives on the 2nd floor, 7th apartment from the left.
No, no, no, she lives on the 3rd floor, 8th apartment from the left.
No. Those first two windows, that's the lobby.
And y'know the other one over there, that's the stairway. You've been counting wrong.
I did not know that! Thank you, Monica.
 I can't believe，I almost lost another girl because of counting!
So, uh, you ready? Yeah, I'll just get my coat. Okay.
Could you get that? Sure.
Joey...?
Aah! No! No!
Uh, first, I would like to say thank you for agreeing to see me again.
That's, uh, quite all right.
But I feel obligated to tell you that this meeting is being videotaped.
Okay. Um.Well, first, I would like to start by apologizing for kissing you...
...and, uh, for yelling at you.
Fair enough.
Now, you're probably going to hire one of the people who, uh...
Who did... Who did not, um, ahem...
...yell at you and storm out.
And I think that's a big mistake. And here's why.
I made a huge fool of myself, and I came back. That shows courage.
When I thought you wanted sex in exchange for this job, I said no.
That shows integrity.
And I was not afraid to stand up for myself...
...and that shows courage.
Okay, ahem.Now, I know that I've already said courage...
...but you've got to have courage.
And, um, finally when I thought you were making sexual advances in the workplace...
...I said no, and I was not litigious.
So there you go. You got courage...
...you got integrity, you got courage again...
...and not litigious.
Look, Mr...
Zelner. Zelner! I knew that.
I knew that!
I really, really want this job.
And I think I would be really good at it.
You know what?
I may regret this, but, uh...
...I'm gonna give you a shot.
Oh, you are? Really?
Oh, thank you. Oh, God!
Oh, would it be completely inappropriate to give you a hug?
Yes. Okay.
Well, how about a handshake? Ha-ha-ha.
Aah! Oh, God! I'm sorry!
Oh, God, I did not mean to touch that! I mean, you!
There! Uh, there. Um...
Okay, so, thank you.
I'm gonna leave. Thank you very much. Thank you so much.
Hey, I'll see you Monday.
You tired Chandler?
You better believe he's tired, after the day we had!
If you know what I mean. Do you know what I mean?
Honey? The tortilla chips know what you mean.
So, uh, Chandler, do you like that badge I got you?
Oh, yeah, it's so cool.
Now, I gotta go. Officer Bing's got a 10-100.
That's pee-pee.
Phoebe, you have a twig in your hair.
We kind of took a detour on our way over here.
we took a little stroll in the park and no one was around, so...
You didn't. We did!
Ha, ha. We violated section 12, paragraph 7 of the criminal code.
The park, huh? Ha, ha.
Public place. Uh-huh.
I hear you. Can you excuse me for a second?
Hi, Chandler.
Monica, this is the men's room.
Isn't it?
Yes, it is.
But see, I've always found the men's bathroom very sexual. Haven't you?
No.
And if I did, I don't think we'd be going out.
This is getting ridiculous.
Come on, we can't let them win! Uh...
Ugh, we have already proved that we are hot! Okay? So why-why are you getting so obsessed about this thing?!
Phoebe and Gary are in that
"can't keep their hands off each other" phase!
So? So.
It makes me really sad that we're not really there anymore.
Oh, is that what this has all been about?
Wasn't it a lot more exciting when we were, you know...
...all over each other all the time?
Yeah, that was great. That was really great.
But to tell you the truth, I'm more excited about where we are now.
Really? Yeah.
I've never been in a relationship that's lasted this long before.
Y'know to get past the beginning and still be around each other all the time, 
I think that's pretty incredible.
And the fact that this is all happening with you...
...I think that's pretty exciting.
That's so sweet.
I know that I was acting a little crazy...
...but I feel the same way. Mm?
You know what I just realized?
You just freaked out about our relationship.
Pfft, I did not. Yes, you did!
Admit it. You freaked out!
I freaked out a little.
A little? You freaked out bigtime, okay?
And I fixed it! We have switched places.
I am the relationship king, and you are the crazy, irrational screwup!
And now we're back.
I cannot believe Ross is buying this.
Thank God. I can't watch him anymore. Ha-ha-ha.
You guys ready for the movies? Yeah.
Oh, by the way, thank you for loaning us Pamela and Yasmine.
Man, they cannot get enough!
Okay, Pick a card. Okay.
All right. Now memorize it.
You got it? Oh, yes.
Okay. Is that your card?
Yes. Ha, ha.
Hey, guys. Hi there.
Guess what. Ben is gonna be in a TV commercial.
What are you talking about? Well, it's not for sure.
But, uh, we met this guy in the park who thought Ben was really cute.
You know, which he is.
Um, anyhoo, he gave us his card and told us to bring him down for this commercial he's auditioning.
Whoa.The guy's like the biggest commercial casting director in town.
Ben takes one lousy walk in the park and gets an audition?
I mean, way to go, Ben!
Man, I've been in that park a million times. No one's ever offered me an audition.
I know, it's crazy. We were just pushing Ben on the swings...
I'm always on the swings.
What am I doing wrong?
That.
Friends  S05E18  The One Where Rachel Smokes
Okay, gotta go. Wish me luck. Good luck.
Hey, Rach, now that you working at Ralph Lauren, can you bring me back some of those polo shirts?
Uh, well, you know what? I don't know if I'd feel comfortable stealing on my very first day.
Unwilling to steal from work.
Interesting.
Besides, if anybody is gonna get free stuff, it's me.
Okay, guys, way to wish me luck.
Good luck! Go get 'em!
Okay, let's discuss Rachel's birthday.
I say we throw a surprise party this weekend.
Whoa, whoa. But her birthday's not for another month.
Okay, but if we throw her a party on her birthday, then it's not a surprise.
I think that's a great idea.
We can have a dinner party and invite her close friends.
Ross. We're having a surprise party for Rachel.
Okay. Done.
Okay, great. So do you wanna do it together? I would love to do it together.
They're gonna do it together.
Dude, that's my girlfriend.
So I gotta shut it down now?
All right, I gotta take off. 
I'm picking up Ben and then we're off to the big audition.
It's gonna be weird to watch some actor pretending to be Ben's dad.
Yeah. Weirder than his two moms making out?
Whoa, whoa. Dad? There's a dad in the commercial?
Yeah. The dad and Ben eat soup and pretend to enjoy it.
Well, maybe I'll go with you and see if I can audition as the dad.
I mean, who better to play Ben's father than his godfather?
You're not his godfather. What?
Are you kidding?
Of course I am.
Okay, let's go, godfather. All right. Ha, ha.
Hey, I'm in. They're gonna let me audition.
Really? That's great.
I know, I know. One of the casting ladies has actually seen me in a play. So I steered clear of her.
That kid looks familiar.
Yeah, he's done tons of commercials.
I've seen him in Sugar Smacks, PlayStation...
...and that one for the phone company.
In fact, he was so good in that one. He actually convinced me to switch phone companies.
Chandler was mad.
Yeah, well, he's not gonna get this one. All right? Ben is way cuter than that kid.
I mean, look at him.
That's great. Listen, wouldn't it be great if I got to play Ben's dad?
Joey, you look nothing like Ben.
I look more like him than you do.
Well, I really don't know you well enough for you to do that.
So it's down to these two.
Nancy, I know you like this one and I think I agree.
Rachel, what do you think?
Well, um, that one is pretty...
...but I just love this fabric. Sorry.
Oh, don't be sorry. That's part of your job here, to give your opinions.
And then I take credit for them. I'm kidding. Ha, ha.
She is kidding. But don't ever disagree with her again.
Okay, now I'm kidding. Oh, ha, ha.
Oh, what a fun office.
I don't know which one. But I do know I need a cigarette.
So, what do you say we take a break, go outside and figure this out when we come back.
Rachel?  Yeah.
You smoke? No.
My dad's a doctor. And he would always tell me just horror stories...
About ghosts and goblins...
...who totally supported the princess' right to smoke.
And then they came back from smoking and they'd made all of the decisions without me.
That doesn't seem fair. I know.
It's like I'm being punished for not having this disgusting, poisonous habit.
Yeah, it is the best.
I mean, what if this keeps happening?
Y'know, they'll-they'll be outside smoking, making all the decisions...
...and I'll just be up in my office breathing in my stupid clean air.
You know? And then when the day comes when Kim wants to promote one of us,who do you think she's gonna pick?
Me or Smokey Smokerson?
Rachel, you can go down there, you don't have to smoke.Just say you wanna get some fresh air.
Yeah, I could do that.
Yeah, or you could just do the easy thing and smoke.
Hey. Rachel，Do you wanna go get coffee? Hey.
Oh, I would love to. Oh, good.
I'm gonna go too, babe. Oh, good.
Oh, I changed my mind.
Okay, let's talk about the party. I have so many ideas.
Ooh, me too. Oh!
Yeah! Oh, look at that.
All right. This is a little sketch of the cake. Uh-huh. Wow.
See? Um, some sample menus.
Um, you know, I thought we'd start with a Tuscan-style finger food.
Okay. And for music, here's an alphabetized list of all of my CDs.
I've highlighted the ones that'll go really good with the food.
What happened to the intimate dinner party? Oh, we're not doing that.
Okay? So... Wow. All right.
Looks like you took care of everything. Thanks a lot, cohost.
Wait. I didn't take care of everything.there's-there's plenty of things for you to do!
Uh-huh? Like what?
Cups.
Cups. You're giving me cups?
And ice.
Cups and ice? Oh, I get to be in charge of cups and ice?
All right.
Fine. Okay, I will be in charge of cups and ice.
Wait, I can get ice at the restaurant...
I got it! Mine!
Hi. Hey.
How did the audition go? Not so good.
Wait a minute. Are you doing Joey's:
"The audition didn't go so well."
Yeah, it did!
Yeah, I am!
Yeah, Ben got a second audition. Oh, great.
Yeah, I had to teach Ross my bit because I actually didn't get a callback.
You got a callback too, didn't you?
Yeah, I did!
Hey, Rachel. What are you doing out here?
You know, it got kind of lonely up there, so I just thought I would come out here and get some fresh air.
We were talking about the fall collection. Oh, great.
So anyway, we really...
I'm sorry. We're smoking all over you. That's okay.
No, no, no. We'll move. You stay there.
I sent the designs to Ralph. He was excited about it.
That's great. You are the best.
Excuse me. Can I bum one of those?
Y'know what, actually this one's...
Okay, okay, okay. What's so funny over here?
I thought you didn't smoke.
You know, I thought you guys meant marijuana cigarettes.
You know what I mean? Like, doobies?
Actually, I thought to myself, "Those guys are crazy."
But no, actually, I smoke the regular ones all the time.
We get high.
Me too.
I'm kidding. Oh!
Me too.
Oh, God. This is so nerve-racking. How do you do this?
Well, fortunately, I don't get many callbacks so...
Is it a good sign that they asked us to hang around after the audition?
Who knows?
Okay. We have narrowed it down to Raymond, Ben, Kyle and Joey.
The rest of you, thank you very much.
Yes! I knew it!
Ah. Bye-bye.
So long.
Later.
This is great. I might actually get to play Ben's dad.
Actually, that can't happen.
Because you all have such different looks...
...we're putting you with Raymond and Kyle with Ben.
So it'll either be you two or you two.
Oh, man.
This is gonna be kind of weird. Yeah, it is.
Yeah. It's gonna be weird.
No. We're like best friends. That's why it's weird.
I thought we were just talking.
Hey. Hey.
Is it okay if I leave this stuff here till Rachel's birthday party?
Uh, sure. What's in them? Um, cups.
Oh, good, because we got Rachel 800 gallons of water.
Seriously, that's a lot of cups.
Yeah, well, that's 'cause in charge of cups and ice,
And Monica's gonna rue the day that she put me in charge of cups and ice.
You know, I rued the day once. Didn't get a whole lot else done.
Okay, time to bring up the rest of the cups.
Hey, Joey. Hey, Pheebs.
Hey. Ross, good, I'm glad you're here.
I want to talk to you about something. Oh. What's up?
Well, I've been thinking about this whole commercial thing.
You know me against Ben. The two of us competing.
Well, that can't lead to anything good. So, 
I think I'm just gonna step aside. I'm gonna tell them that I won't audition.
Wow. Uh...Joey, that's great. Thanks, man.
That's it?
You're gonna let me do this? This is my career we're talking about here.
But you just I just said that so you wouldn't let Ben do it.
Look, Ross, if anyone should step aside, it should be Ben.
What? Chandler, tell him.
Well, let me get the door first.
Oh, hi, no one.
Why should Ben step aside?
It was his audition in the first place.
You just tagged along. You're like the tag-along dad.
At least I care about his feelings.
What?
Do you know how hard this is gonna be on him when he doesn't get it?
And why wouldn't he get it?
Oh, come on.Have you seen what my kid can do? Huh?
I mean, he dials phones, he eats tortilla chips.
He plays soccer with the cartoon tiger.
Are you saying your kid eats soup better than my kid?
You just give him a spoon, baby.
Oh, yeah? I guess we'll see. Yeah.
Because this commercial belongs to me and Mitch.
Your kid's name is Raymond. Yeah? So is yours.
How did work go? Oh, it was great. It was great.
I went down there just like you said.
And we talked business. And Kim totally took my opinions.
You stink.
Thanks. No, I'm serious.
That's because I went down there and they were smoking.
This is actually the smell of success.
But there's something different, though.Oh, my God. You smoked.
I did not. Yes, you did.
You look happy and sick. You smoked.
All right, fine. But I had to. I had to do it for my career.
I wish I had to smoke for my career.
That's so gross.
Well, no, it's not that bad, you know?
I mean, yeah, my tongue feels a little fuzzy and my fingers sort of smell.
I actually feel like I could throw up.
But you gotta push past this, okay? Because it's about to get so good.
Chandler.
I have to tell you, you smell so smoky, I have to get up.
I'm not kidding.
I think you smell great.
So we're decided. No on plaid, yes on pink.
Absolutely.
I'm so onboard.
Rachel, didn't you just light that?
Yeah. But you know what? I'm just really, really trying to cut back, you know.
Good luck, Rach.
I've actually been thinking about quitting.
Oh, well, sure. Every Sunday night, I tell myself I'm quitting.
Every Monday morning, it's like:
Tell me about it.
Well, let's quit. We'll just quit. Let's all quit.
It does sound appealing.
I never could do it. But you could. You can. Absolutely.
We can help each other out.
We could get those patches. We could be like the Patch Sisters.
You know, we really should quit. Okay, let's quit.
Yes. Great. Give me those cigs. Come on. Give it. Give it. Out. Done. Quit. Whoo!
My late husband gave me that lighter.
I'm not kidding.
Okay, then. Okay.
Mm, soup.
Mm, soup.
Mm, soup.
Joey, Ross is gonna be here any second.
would you mind watching Ben for me while I use the ladies' room?
Yeah, no problem. Thanks.
Hi, Ben.
So you want to be an actor, huh?
Well, I gotta tell you, it's no picnic.
There's tons of rejection.
No stability.
I mean, one day, you're Dr. Drake Ramoray.
The next day, you're eating ketchup right out of the bottle.
Joey.
Ross.
Ben.
I mean, Ben. Ben.
Okay, Raymond, Joey, you're up.
Hi. Okay.
All right, well, let's try one. Whenever you guys are ready.
Uh-oh. Is there a problem?
Well, this is noodle soup. And I've been working with tomato.
But that's okay. No problem. No problem.
Mm, noodle soup.
You know, that's fine. But the line is, "Mm, soup."
Oh. What'd I say? Mm, noodle soup.
How's that different?
Oh. Right. Yeah.
All right. Let's try one.
Mm, noodle soup.
Okay. Let's do it again. Okay.
Mm, soup.I mean, noodle soup. I mean, soup.
Come on!
You know what? We need to move on.
Oh, no, I could do it one more time.See, look.
Mm, noodle soup.
Damn it.
Hey. Hey.
Uh-oh. Busted.
Come on, you guys. What are you doing? I thought we were the Patch Sisters.
Yeah, that didn't work out.
Rachel, we tried to quit. But it was too hard.
Well, y'know, if you started smoking again, you could have at least told me.
Come on, give me one of those. What are we talking about?
No, you're doing great. Don't give up.
That's why we didn't tell you, and we are not gonna drag you down with us.
Oh, wait. No, no. Drag me down. Drag me down.
Forget it, Rachel. We're both so proud of how well you're doing.
I'm not gonna let you blow it.
In fact, if I catch you, you're fired.
So go on, get out of here. Go on. I don't want you breathing this stuff. Go on.
So okay. So you'll come with me on the Paris trip?
Oh, man.
Hey, check it out. Cup hat, cup banner...
...cup chandelier and the thing that started it all. The cup.
Great job with the cups, Pheebs. Ha, ha.
Why don't you just go out with her?
Did you notice the ice? Look.
We have it all. We have crushed, cubed and dry. Watch.
Mystical.
Everyone--no one's eating my Tuscan finger food 'cause they're all filling up on Phoebe's snow cones!
There are snow cones?
Snow cones. Yuck.
Y'know…go! Go! Right there!  Thank you.
Look, look. Surprise.
What? My birthday is not for another month.
That's the surprise.
Oh, my God, you guys. This is so great.
It's so unexpected.I mean, Chandler's birthday's even before mine.
Surprise.
Wow. This is so great. Look at all these...
...cups. This is so weird.
I was in charge of cups.
Oh, okay. Not so weird.
Hey. Hey.
Listen, man. I'm sorry the audition didn't go well.
Yeah, right.
No, really. I am, Joey. I feel bad.
Well, look, Ross. You don't have to, okay?
It's not your fault I suck.
What kind of an actor can't even say, "Mm, noodle soup"?
Hey, you know what? Maybe you didn't mess up your audition because you suck.
Maybe you messed up because you care more about your godson.
What do you mean? I think, subconsciously...
Whoa, you lost me.
I think, on some level,
you sabotaged your own audition
so Ben would get the part.
Well, your way sounds a lot better than mine.
Yeah.
Yeah. It's not that I'm a bad actor. No.
No, it's just that, uh, I care so damn much about little Ben...
...that, uh, it was more important for me to see him succeed.
There you go. Thank you. Thank you.
So did he get it? No.
Ah, what are you gonna do?
Oh, hi. Excuse me. Is Rachel Green here? I'm supposed to meet her for lunch.
Oh, she doesn't come down anymore. You can find her up on 10.
Okay, great.
So we talked about the  whole presentation yesterday at lunch and he wondered if one person would be enough  to get a take on the trip
And I said, "Yeah, absolutely."
I'll catch you guys later.
Hey. Hey.
Wow, you look nice. What's the occasion?
Monica and I are celebrating our 10-month anniversary.Got reservations at Jean-George. Wow.
How'd you get in? Oh.
Made a few calls, pulled some strings
and they agreed to seat us at 11:30 if we both had the chicken and didn't get desert.
Hi, Chandler. Hey, Caitlin.Somebody got a haircut.
Ugh. I hate it. I look like an 8-year-old boy.
If that was true, gym class would've been  a lot more interesting.
It's, uh, $27 even. Oh, okay. Here you go.
Where's the chicken? Oh, it's in the back. The duck pissed him off.
He said that eggs came first.
Ha, ha, thanks. I'll see you later. Okay. Bye.
What the hell was that? What?
The flirting.
Aren't you supposed to be going out with, hmm, let's see,
my sister?
I was not flirting. It was totally flirting!
"Somebody got a haircut "
First of all, the impression? Uncanny.
And second, that wasn't flirting. That was just casual conversation between two people. That is all.
Oh! Yeah, right.
You wanna see flirting? I'll show you flirting.
I'm good. I'm okay.
Friends  S05E19  The One Where Ross Can't Flirt
I am so proud of Joey.
He's gonna be on Law and Order! I know.
But don't you think it should be called Order and Law?
No because first they arrest the guy and then they try him.
Yeah. Don't get me started on that.
I was not flirting. And on your anniversary. For shame!
What's going on? Chandler was hitting on the hot delivery girl.
I was not. And oh, God! Shh!
I'm sorry, but you were.
Okay? And besides, if anyone should be hitting on her ..it's the guy who's single
the guy that who-who-who can do something about it.
Sounds like someone wants to be Mr. Pizza Delivery Girl.
Well... Is that what this is about? You like Caitlin?
Ha, ha, Ross, we broke up two years ago. You've been married since then.
I think it's okay that we see other people.
Well, I-I was watching her the other day at the pizza place.
And she was just so sexy and funny
and has the cutest little
Okay, y'know what? We don't need her measurements. Ha, ha.
Okay Pepperoni, pepperoni, pepperoni.
Ross, I know she's pretty and you love her, but is she stupid?
She forgot my vegetarian.
This is perfect.
She'll have to come back here with your pizza.
And when she does, I will turn on the charm "au" Ross.
Oh, I am so glad you don't eat meat. Ha, ha.
See? Vegetarianism benefits everyone. Mm.
Hey, everybody, look who's here! You remember my grandmother.
Big night! Yeah, it's so cool.
Joey on Law and Order. You must be very proud.
Chandler, she doesn't understand a word of English.
Ha, ha, I thought you were Joey's other grandmother.
I've done it again.
Nonnie's my biggest fan.
Yeah, She's the only one in the family who's always believed in me.
Big star. My big fat Joey star.
Yeah, I weighed, like, 27 pounds when I was born.
Hey. Happy anniversary. Happy anniversary, 10 months.
So umm, when I was in the shower I was thinking about our first night in London.
Oh, uh, Joey's grandmother's right there.
Is that the one that speaks English or the one that doesn't?
The one who doesn't.
That was some hot love you gave me. Ha-ha-ha.
I'll get ready. Hey, why don't you wear those earrings I gave you?
Oh, that's a great idea. I was saving them for something special. Okay.
You've got to go home.
But I like it here.
You gotta go home and get the earrings that you borrowed from me okay? Chandler wants me to wear them tonight.
Okay, well I think that they're in my purse. 
Why don't you go get dressed and I'll look for them. Okay.
Ahem, Rach. Hi.I need those earrings you borrowed.
Okay. Yeah, I'll be right back. Okay.
Wow, Pheebs, you speak Italian?
I guess so.
Here you go. Thanks.
Oh, what,you-you want both of them? Ha, ha.
Rachel Karen Green, where's the other earring?
Okay, okay. Look, just don't freak out,
but I kind of lost it. Oh, I know it's in the apartment, but I definitely lost it.
Well, what am I going to tell Monica? She wants to wear them tonight!
Tell her to wear her own earrings. These are her earrings.
Nooo! Nooooo!
You lent me Monica's earrings? I'm not allowed to borrow her stuff.
Why not? Because I lose her stuff!
He, uh, left a little after 2.
Okay, You see that blind guy right there?
I'm gonna bash his head in later.
Oh, uh, my big scene's coming up. Uh, the big scene coming up.
If you said, "Big lima bean bubbling up," Would she understand the difference?
Rach, what are you doing?
Oh, I just can't watch. It's too scary.
Huh. It's a diaper commercial.
Oh, yeah, well, you know me. Babies, responsibilities，ahhh!!!
Pizza delivery. I'll get it! I will get that!
Hi. Hi.
 One uh, vegetarian pizza.
That's $12.15. Ah.
Uh, by the way, if it makes you feel any better, uh  I happen to like 8-year-old boys.
What?
Oh, I mean  No, no, no. The, uhYour hair. Before. Your hair.
You said you thought your hair looked like an 8-year-old boy's
and I'm just saying I like it.
The hair.
Oh. Thanks.
You want to see, I don't actually like 8-year-old boys.
All I'm looking for is the money.
Here you go. Now, stop bringing us pizzas, you.
I'm gonna try. Ha, ha. Okay.
You're welcome.
You couldn't let me have her, could you?
What?
This is a girl I really like and you had to swoop in there!
What's going on? Chandler was totally flirting with the hot delivery girl.
Thank you for that.
I was not flirting.
It's okay. I don't care. Ha, ha. It's fine.
Really? Really?
It's no big deal. I do it all the time.
So, uh  Ahem. You flirt with guys all the time?
Sure. It doesn't mean anything. Just like I know it doesn't mean anything with you.
But there's a big difference. Sorry, You are a lot hotter than I am.
True story.
Ha, ha. Chandler, This actually bothers you?
Yes, it does bother me! And I think it'd bother a lot of people.
When you were going out with Ross,
did it bother you when he flirted with other women?
Uh, no. No, it bothered me when he slept with other women.
And thank you for that.
But I never had anything to worry about.Ross was never very good at the flirting thing.
What ? What ? Ha, ha.
What are you talking about? It worked with you.
Oh! Y'know what? you're right.
Oh! We met, you flirted and then, bam, nine years later, you had me.
All right. All right.You know what I'm gonna do?
I am gonna order another pizza. And when Caitlin gets here
you-you--I will show how well I flirt. 
Yeah! I will, I will get her phone number! Oh, well
And not the one on the menu.
I found it. Oh, thank God! Where was it?
On your dresser.
Okay, that is the one we already have. Oh.
Okay, here's my big scene. My big scene's here.
Anybody home?
Oh, my God. What?
Okay, everybody just keep smiling.
It'll kill my grandmother if she finds out. Ha, ha.
Oh, what is it? Uh, they cut me out of the show.
What?
Are you sure?
Maybe your scene's coming up.
Not likely. Because you see that body bag right there?
Yeah. I'm in it.
This is terrible, what are you going to do?
I don't know.
This little, old lady lives for my career.
When they dumped me off Days of Our Lives, she almost died.
That's not good.
You're not smiling. Not that face! Smile, everybody smile! Ha, ha.
Joey，Why don't you just tell her what happened? It's not your fault.
If we keep talking this way, aren't we gonna freak her out soon?
Oh, uh, soon. I'm gonna be on soon.
There I am!
No.Sam Waterston!
Oh, no, no. That's me. That's me!
No. Sam Waterston.
Crime Misdemeanor, Capricorn One.
She doesn't know "hello," but she knows Capricorn One.
Phoebe! I have to have those earrings, we're going to leave as soon as the show is over
But I already gave them back to you.
No, you didn't.
All right, I already didn't gave them back to you. That's what I said.
Ahem. Rachel，Where's that other earring?
It's not here, Pheebs. It's not here. Oh!
I went to Joey and Chandler's last night!
Okay! Make sure you check Chandler's jewelry box.
Wait a minute, Chandler has a jewelry box?
Okay, we have like ten minutes. Do you want me to get into that now?!
Hey Pheebs! How's that uh, vegetarian pizza working out for ya?
You and those vegetables have a real thing going on, huh?
Why are you being weird?
Do you like it?
No. That would be, "Why are you being cute?"
Okay. I'm working on my flirting.
Oh! I did not get that.
So, uh, Monica,do you like the Law & Order?
Yeah, it's good. Oh.
See, I'm finding out all this stuff about you today,
like you like the Law & Order 
and that you flirted with every guy in the Tri-State area!
Okay, let me get this straight. It's okay for you to flirt, but not for me?
Oh, I'm so glad we cleared that up.
Look, I'm sorry, but some things are different for men and women.
Go on, teach me about men and women.
Okay. I've already taught you so much already, but whatever.
See when you flirt with a guy
you think, "I'm just flirting, no big deal."
But the guy thinking, "Finally! Somebody who wants to sleep with me."
No way! It's true.
Well, that's pathetic. Again, true.
This goes for all guys? All guys that are awake.
Then we go to sleep.
All guys from the other end of the world wake up and behave the exact same way.
All right. It's another commercial and I still haven't told her.
Joey, This is like the last commercial. Look, You've got 10 minutes left.
I know! What am I gonna do? Oh!
No! You are not gonna run out and leave her here.
Yeah, all right. Oh!
Joey?
Uh, Joey's gonna be right back.
Right back?
Meanwhile, let's-let's-let's talk about you. 
So, you're old and small.
Hey. Did you find it?
The earring? No. But look, I found my sunglasses under the couch!
I've been looking for these since last summer.
Those are my sunglasses. You borrowed them from me.
Okay. Calm down. Here they are.
Phoebe.
What do we do? I don't know. I don't know!
We'll just have to tell Monica, that's all.
Oh, God! She's gonna kill me.
I suppose I could tell her it's just all my fault.
Oh, that'd be great.
Mon, could I talk to you?
Yeah. What is it? Um
I lost one of your earrings. I'm sorry. I am so, so sorry.
All right, well, I mean, what can you do? If you lost it, you lost it.
I'll replace it, I promise. I feel so terrible.
That's fine. You didn't do it on purpose. No.
Look at you. Come here.
You feel better? Ha, ha. Yeah. You're the best.
Okay, wait a minute.
Wait a minute, I can't do this.
Listen, honey, it's not Phoebe's fault.
She lent me the earrings. I lost it. I'm so sorry, honey.
I feel terrible too.
That is exactly why I do not lend you stuff!
Okay?! I mean, first it's my jewelry! And if it's not my jewelry, it's-it's my blue sweater!
And if it's not my sweater, it's my sunglasses.
Your sunglasses? Yes.
Oh, right.
Pizza. Oh, mine! Mine! Mine!
Okay, here goes.
Prepare yourselves for some class-A flirting.
Okay, hold on.
Okay.
Honey, you have nothing to prove.
If you really like this girl, I don't think flirting is the right way
You'll see.Okay.
Oh, what's her name?
Caitlin!
Caitlin.
Hey.
Oh, we can't keep eating like this. Ha, ha.
Heh. It's, uh, $12.50.
Okay, um
So
Do you make the pizzas in one of those, uh, wood-burning ovens?
No, actually, I think they're gas.
Gas? Wow, ha, ha.
Intense.
If this is the way all the Gellers flirt,
we don't have a problem.
Hey, uh You know that smell gas has?
Yeah.
They put that in. What?
The gas is odorless.
But they add the smell so you know when there's a leak.
Well, okay.
A lot of other gas smells.
Oh, the humanity.
Methane smells
You know what? Um, actually, I really should go.
Oh, but I haven't paid you yet.
Y'know what? That's okay. You guys have ordered so many that this one's on me.
Was I talking to her about gas?
More so than anything else.
I-I-I found it interesting.
I'm sorry. Look, no-no, Hey, hey. 
Don't worry about it.
In nine years, she and I will be right there! Ha, ha.
Okay. Well, I'm gonna clear out some of these boxes.
Ross? Yeah?
What else do they add smell to?
Caitlin! Caitlin! Hi.
Hi, I'm Rachel. Oh.
From upstairs, people with all the pizza.
Oh, was there a problem? No. No. Every thing's--they're fine.Great pizza.
But, actually, um, my friend Ross
he just gets really nervous when he's flirting.
Oh, my God! That was flirting?  Yeah.
I know, I know.
but uh just, I'm telling you,  once, once you get past that part,
where it just feels like you wanna die
he's-he's really a good person.
The guy with the gas? Yeah.
I'm-I'm telling you， he's really sweet and really funny
and he's just, oh, got a good heart.
And besides, I think he really likes you. Really?
Well,y'know, we have seven people and 10 pizzas. What do you think?
I just, I thought Joey was there.
You've got till Monday. Then I move to dismiss.
Hey, Ross?
Um, I just ran into Caitlin in the hallway and-and 
Uh, you must be getting better at this flirting stuff than I thought. Ha, ha.
What do you mean?
I don't get it but she wanted me to give you her phone number.
And she just gave you this? Yeah!
Rach, thanks. But I don't need you doing me any favors.
 I-I-I didn't! I didn't. She thought you were cute.
Well, that I can believe.
Hey,
is the show still on?.
Almost over, man
Oh! Is that the Pope?
Why am I looking?
Oh, Nonnie, here I am! This is my big scene.
All right, back off!
I got a gun!
I'm not afraid to use it.
Oh, Joey. That's right, Nonnie.
You couldn't have at least changed your shirt?
Now, I want a suitcase filled with $100,000
Filled with $100,000 in small bills.
And if I don't get  Shoo!
And if I don't get it
I'm gonna shoot this duck!
Oh, no!
I'm coming out!
And she's supposed to buy this?
Joey, bravo!

Tonight? You-you didn't say it was going to be at nighttime.
Friends  S05E20  The One With The Ride Along
Hey. Hey.
I'm so glad you're home, I thought tonight we could finally organize these photos!
Oh, thank God. Finally.
Okay, I've broken them down into categories.
We got holidays, birthdays, candids...
And then what I've done is I've cross-referenced them by subject. Right?
So if you're looking up, oh let's say birthdays and dogs,
you get photo 152.
See?
Oh, it's me and LePoo.
Wow, I miss that dog.
You can also find him under umm, dog and dead.
Great. Thanks.
All right, Hand me that other box of photos.
that's the very last one. Okay.
Oops.
Sorry.
Well, good thing you number all of them, huh?
I hadn't. Photo 152 was a prototype.
Ohhhh. Honey, honey, honey, it's okay, it's okay honey. I'm gonna fix you a drink, huh? Maybe a margarita?
Ross has the blender.
Everything's just falling apart.
No honey, it's okay!
Listen, I'll got to Ross's and get the blender, you get all the margarita stuff ready.
All right, he's keys are in the drawer. 
Y'know what? I also need some cash.
Okay, you want me to stop at the ATM?
Nah, while you're at Ross's if you see any lying around¡­
What?
What?! I-I-I don't, I don't do that! 
That was so cool, man. The way you leaned on that guy.
It is starting to get dark out there.
He told you everything. I mean you totally cracked him.
Yeah well, being that he was the victim, they're usually pretty talkative.
Okay, but it is officially nighttime.
Oh hey, Gary, want me to grab the berry for ya?
It's called the cherry.
 It's the—Chandler!!
Okay, I got it! This place makes the best sandwich in the world!
Hey Joe does it have meatballs on it? Oh-ho, yeah!
Does it have melted cheese and marinara sauce?
Yeah, you can't eat that in my car.
Yeah, okay.
Even though my tax dollars paid for this car.
Your tax dollars?
Yeah, okay.
Wow! That sandwich really does smell good.
Did I say you could smell it?
I can't smell your sandwich?
Half the taste is in the smell.
You-you're sucking up all the tastiness!
Okay, I'll give them back.
Look! What is so great about that sandwich?
Okay. Imagine the best sex you ever had. Okay.
Are you thinking about Monica? Yeah.
Yeah, what's that like?
Ohh please don't be from a real dinosaur. Please, please.
Please, please, please.
"Made in Mexico." Yes!
Who would buy this?
Rach, it's me. Pick up.
Hey! What's up?
I need a few more things to make the margaritas.
Uhh, I need some salt, some margarita mix, and tequila.
So all we have is ice?
See if he has ice.
Okay.
Hello Ross? It's Emily.
I know this is out of the blue
but uh, I'm getting married tomorrow.
Well, maybe I am. I keep thinking about you
and I'm wondering if-if we made a mistake giving up so fast.
Are you thinking about me?
Of course you're not.
But if you are, call me tonight.
Okay, bye.
So where are we going next?
This witness won't return my calls so we're gonna see if we can surprise him coming home.
Surprise him? We're not gonna make anybody mad, are we?
Come on, man.
Listen so uh, are you gonna squeeze the perps shoes a little bit before he lawyers up?
He's a witness, not a perp. And no one talks like that.
Yeah. No one talks like that.
Oh, what, like you're Mr. Cop?
I'm more cop than you two.
How do you figure that?
Hello! I'm in the front seat,  okay?
I'm Gary's partner.
Y'know, When you say "partner," it doesn't sound cop.It sounds gay.
Um, jealous.
Hey, do you mind? We're under cover here.
Oh, yeah. No problem
Ross. Sorry. Sorry! Oh, 
There.
Hey, Gary. Who am I?
Phone home.
Look at Officer Ross riding back here with the visitors.
Yeah, What's up with that, Serpico?
Are you thinking about me?.
No, of course you're not
But if you are, call me tonight.
Okay, bye.
No.
I know.
Well thank God you were here!  We have to erase that.
What? We can't do that.
We have to.
what if Ross's hears that and then calls her back and then they get back together?
Is that what you want?
Ross back with that controlling, neurotic, crazy Emily?
The Emily that wouldn't let him see you?
No. Oh, no, no.God, no.
He should not get back with her.
I know that, you know that. Even Ross knows that.
But that still doesn’t give us the right to erase his message!
I'm his sister. okay? 
and I love him. I don't want to see him get hurt.
Come on! Doesn't that give me the right to control him...
Help him?
I don't think he's the one who needs help.
No, look, she's obviously unstable, okay?
I mean she's thinking about running out on her wedding day.
Okay, fine! But I mean, look at the position she's putting him in!
What's he gonna do?
Ross is gonna run over there on the wedding day and break up the marriage?!
I mean, who would do that?!
Okay, fine. All right. but that's y'know, it's different! 
Although it did involve a lot of the same people.
Y'know what, this is obviously some kind of twisted joke she's trying to play on him.
Okay, you are crazy!
I'm sorry, but she sounded generally upset!
I mean, listen!
Your messages have been erased.
Noooooooo!
Okay, y'know, we-we're safe right? I mean nothing bad can go down!
No. But that reminds me. Sign this.
What is it?
Oh it's nothing, it just says that you can't sue the city if you scrap your knee or y'know, get your head blown off.
Oh, hurry up. I want to sign that.
Okay, Here he comes.
What is he doing? What the hell is he doing?
What? What? What? What is it?
Is everything okay? What's going on?
Okay, he sees us. Now don't move. Don't look at him.
Hey, it's okay. It was just a car backfire.
Hey, look at that. You tried to save your buddy.
You see that? You see what he did?
You okay, man?
Uh-huh. Thanks, Joey.
Uh... Hello?
Hi.
All right, I guess we should go.
No, wait. wait.
Oh, yeah. Right.
No. Monica.
Monica, we have to fix this.
There's nothing we can do. You erased the message!
Yeah well unless we tell him.
Well, if you're gonna be totally rational about this, I can't argue with you!
All right? Fine, if you wanna tell him, tell him. I just don't want to be a part of it.
Oh, maybe that's Emily calling back to leave the exact same message.
Hey Ross! It's you! I just want you to remember this feeling.
You are lucky to be alive.
So live every day to the fullest.
Love yourself, okay?
Oh, and also get stamps. Bye!
Wow! Play that message for Emily, and this problem goes away.
Right?
Hey, anybody want to meet a hero?
John Glenn is here?
No. Joey.
Pheebs, We had the most incredible night. Okay,
so, we're in the car... Wait. Hold on.
Hi. Hi.
Okay, go ahead.
Okay, okay, So we're in the car, Right?
And bang! A shot was fired.
And Joey with no regard for his own safety throws himself on me!
My God, Joey!
It was a car backfire.
Yeah, But he didn't know that.Yeah, I didn't know that.
And it could've just as easily have been a bullet.
Hey Joe, you ever think about joining the force? We could use a guy like you.
Who jumps at loud noises.
Wow. I could have died tonight.
Yeah! If the car that backfired had run over you.
I think I'll go home before Ross starts rambling about his newfound respect for life.
I do have a newfound respect for life.
Oh, my God.
So you wanna get some dinner?
Yeah, sure.
Oh, y'know what? If I heard a shot right now, I'd throw my body on you.
Oh yeah? Well maybe you and I should take a walk through a bad neighborhood.
Okay.
Bye. Bye.
Cut it out Ross!
I hate to have to save your life and kick your ass in the same day!
Dude.
How come you took off?
Oh, I just went for a walk, around the living room. Whatever¡­
Is something wrong?
No. No, I'm just tired.Y'know, from-from the walk.
Okay. You dove in front of Ross! Ross!
Ross.
That's what this is about.
Oh, my God. You hate Ross.
I don't hate Ross. Of course you do.
I saved him. You're mad at me. It all adds up.
You want Ross out of the picture. What picture?
I don't know. But I don't like what I'm hearing.
Look I'm very glad that you saved Ross from the car backfire,
but y'know, it could've been a bullet and you y'know, you didn't try to save me!
Ohh, you're upset because you think I chose Ross over you.
No, I knew you could take care of yourself.
You know? I mean, Ross needs help. He's not "street" like us.
When it comes down to it, you would risk your life for Ross before you would for me.
That's the bottom line.
Well, no, not exactly! 
All right, look, I, I wasn't trying to save Ross.
Okay?
My sandwich was next to Ross.
All right?
I was, I was trying to save my sandwich.
From a bullet?
I know it doesn't make much sense.
"Much" sense?
Look Chandler, it was instinct. Okay? I just went for it!
So you risked your life, for a sandwich!
I know it sounds crazy...
...but Chandler this is the greatest sandwich in the world.
So you didn't uh, choose Ross before me.
No. I would never do that.
You're like my brother.
Really?  Yeah. In fact, to prove how much you mean to me...
Here.
Thanks. No, eh, oh-oi, easy, it's not a hot dog!
How good is that?
See?
Oh-whoa-hey, dude, What are you doing?
I thought you were showing me how much you mean to me.
Yeah. With a bite!
Gee-e-e-eez!
Hi.
Rach, what uh, what are you doing here?
Hey, you know what? You are in our apartment all the time.Okay? This is, this is just a drop in the bucket mister!
It doesn't matter. The important thing is that you're here.
You're my friend and you're here.
Okay, just a little scared. What's going on Ross?
The most amazing thing happened tonight.
I thought my number was up.
I had an actual near-death experience.
What?! What? What happened?!
Okay, okay, we were on the ride along with Gary, right? 
and somebody took a shot at me.
Really?
No. A car backfired.
But I thought somebody was taking a shot at me.
And, Rach...I survived.
And I was filled with this great respect for life.
Y'know? I-I want to experience every moment.
I want to seize every opportunity.
I-I am seeing everything so-so clearly now.
Because a car backfired?
Okay. Why are you here?
Well, I-I-I don't know how this fits into your whole "seizing" thing...
...but Emily called you today.
You talked to her? No, She left a message.
But it kind of got erased.
I mean,  There's just ... something wrong with your machine.
Well, okay, what-what did she say?
Well,something about having second thoughts about the wedding.
And did you guys make a mistake breaking up?
And she wants you to call her.
Now, that-that was a good thing that I told you, right?
Yeah. Yes. Of course.
Okay, thank you. Thank you.
Because...I'm gonna tell Monica I was right.
Because y'know what?  she didn't want...Not important.
Point is, I was right. Your decision.
Okay? I was right. Your decision.
Right.
I guess I should call Emily.
No, that's not the right decision.
That's not right. Ross, come on.
I mean, that woman made you miserable!
Okay, Ross? Do you really want to get back into that?
Okay, look. Yesterday...I wouldn't have even considered calling her back.
But my ex-wife calls on the same day...I have a near-death experience?
I mean, that-that has got to mean something!
That was not a near-death experience. That was barely an experience.
You weren't there.
 Okay, Maybe this is something that I'm supposed to seize, you know?
Okay. You know what?
Maybe this is not about seizing stuff.
Maybe this is about escaping stuff.
Okay? Look at today.I mean, you escaped...
...death.
y'know? And maybe this is a chance for you to escape getting back together with Emily.
That does make sense.
Because I do want to seize some opportunity...
...but I really don't want to see or talk to her.
Well, there you go.
Yeah, maybe today's just close-call day.
Hey, thanks, Rach.
Oh, honey. No problem.
Oh wait-wait-wait! The message is blinking.
Maybe you didn't erase it.
Hey, Ross, it's you...
Oh yeah, no that's-that's an old message,
Nobody needs to hear that. No.
Hey, um, was Monica here? Yeah.
I want my money back.
Yeah, uh You probably need that for stamps, right?
Hey, Pheebs? Has Gary ever been shot at for real?
Yes, once.
Yeah, a little. 
He kind of did it to himself. It's not really a good story.
I wonder how I'd react under fire.y'know?
And not backfire...but-but heavy fire, 
like I was in a war or something.
Man, I would be great in a war.
I mean, I really, I think I'd make a fantastic military leader.
I mean, I know I'd make general before any of you guys.
Before or after you were shot by your own troops?
I know where Joey would be.
He would be down in the foxhole protecting all of us.
Yes, if the foxhole was lined with sandwiches.
Yeah, hero sandwiches.
Well you all know I'm a pacifist, so I'm not interested in war in any way.
But y'know what? when the revolution comes, I'll have to destroy you all.
Not you, Joey.
Would you like some more coffee, baby-doll?
I'm fine. Thanks.
Yeah, see, I can't pull of "baby doll," can I?
No, I think we learned that from the "sugar lips" incident.
I'm gonna get some tea. Okay.
How you doing, pumpkin?
Nope.
So it looks like it's going really well for you two, huh?
I know. Really well. In fact, I'm gonna ask Phoebe to move in with me.
Oh, my God. What do you think?
I think that it's so great. When are you gonna ask her?
Tonight. But don't say anything, okay?
I swear. I promise. I promise.
My God, I'm so excited.
All right, listen let me tell you, do not get her flowers. Okay?
Because y'know, she cries when they die, and there's the whole funeral
I'll see you after work, sweetie. Okay. Bye.
So, what movie should we see?
Gary's gonna ask you to move in with him.
What? Really? He just told me at the counter.
He made me promise not to tell but I couldn't hold it in any longer.
I can't believe this. Right? Because it's fast. Because it's so fast. It's fast.
Relax. It's Phoebe, not you. Oh.
Good for you, Pheebs. Way to go.
No, but it is fast, isn't it? No.
I like him a lot but I don't think I'm ready.
So, what are you gonna do? I don't know. I'll just handle it.
I'll ask you to talk to him.
Me? Why me?
Because you are so afraid of commitment.
You talk to him. Make him scared like you,
make him a man.
I'll try, but I'm not sure what good it would do...
...because I'm less afraid of commitment than I used to be.
That is so sweet.
Still terrified. I'll take care of it no problem.
Friends  S05E21  The One With The Ball
Hey, Ross, is, uh, Staten Island really an island?
Uh-huh. That's why they call it Staten "Island."
Oh, I thought it was like Long Island.
Also an island.
Hey, what time is it? Two seventeen.
Wow, you realize we've been throwing this ball
without dropping it for an hour?
Are you serious?
Yeah, I realized it a half-hour ago, but I didn't wanna say anything because I didn't wanna jinx it.
Wow, we are pretty good at this.
Hey, we totally forgot about lunch.
I think that's the first time I've ever missed a meal.
Yeah, my pants are a little loose!
Hey, you guys. Uh, is Monica here?
No. No.
All right listen umm, I just bought something I'm not sure she's gonna like it,
And it's gonna seem crazy...
...but this is something I've wanted since I was a little girl.
You bought Shaun Cassidy.
No. I wish.
Okay, you ready? Yeah.
OK
Check it out.
Oh, my God. What is it? What the hell is that?
It's a cat.
That is not a cat.
Yes, it is.
Why is it inside out?
Excuse me,
but this is a purebred, show-quality sphinx cat.
How much did you pay for that?
Well, it was a little extravagant, but I got a pretty good deal.
Yeah, how much?
A thousand bucks.
On a cat?
It's not a cat.
All right. Listen, ball boys.
My grandmother had one of these when I was little. and it was the sweetest thing.
I mean, it was so cute, it would sit in my lap and just purr all day long...
...and I would drag a shoe string on the ground and it would chase it.
Free cats do that too, you know.
It's not a cat.
Look, guys, I'm really excited about this, okay? I don't care what you think.
I'm gonna go set up a little litter box for Mrs. Whiskerson.
Well, what am I gonna call her? Fluffy?
Hey, do you wanna get something to eat
or, uh..do you wanna see how long we can throw this ball back and forth? Huh?
Uh, the ball thing. Yeah?
Hey, Ross, wouldn't it be great if we could go for like two straight hours without dropping it?
Uh, yeah, it would.
Let's do it. Okay.
Uh-oh. What?
I have to pee. And Rachel's in the bathroom.
Man, I didn't think we were gonna make it.
I know.
Don't switch hands, okay?
Hey, ladies. What are you in here for?
Hey, Chandler, what are you doing here?
Gary, I am here to report a crime. Yeah?
It is a crime that you and I don't spend more time together.
Ha, ha. What's up?
Uh, well, I heard that you were thinking about asking Phoebe to move in with you...
...and I thought maybe we should have a talk, you know, man to... well, me.
Sure, okay.
Um, are you crazy?
Are you insane? If you live with Phoebe, you two are gonna be, you know, living together.
Yeah, I considered that. I just know it'd make me happy.
Heh. You mean scared. No, I mean happy.
Scared happy.
Chandler, what are you doing?
I am trying to open your eyes, my man! Don't you see,
if you lived with Phoebe she's always gonna be there.
You're gonna get home, she's there. You go to bed, she's there.
You wake up and oh, yes, she's there.
I know. I can't wait.
Were your parents happy or something?
Listen, Chandler, the way I see it. I was lucky enough to find someone that I really love.
I just wanna be around her as much as I can.
Wow, you know, when you say it, it doesn't sound so scary.
So you know what I'm talking about? Yeah, I think I do.
You know what? You move in with her.
You move in right with her right now.
Maybe I should move in with Monica.
No, it's too soon for you guys.
Yeah, you're right about that.
…now when they found the remains of the Mesozoic mastodon...
...they discovered what appeared to be the remains of a Paleozoic amphibian in its jaws.
How did it get there?
Maybe this should be more of a quiet game.
Hey, guys. Hey.
Joey, I left my watch on the counter last night.
 It was right here, Where is it?
I don't know. Well, come on, I'm late for work.
How do you know? You don't have a watch.
Guys, could you stop throwing the ball for one minute and just help me find it?
Oh, I don't know. Yeah, can't do it.
What?
Whatever you do, do not drop that ball
Yeah, we haven't dropped it in...
Two hours, 27 minutes.
Really?
I'm not gonna be able to make it in to work today. Um, I don't feel very good.
Yes!
Wow, uh, for a second there, I thought I was feeling better, but I'm not.
Hey, Rach. Hey.
Check it out. Almost three hours without dropping it.
Wow, congratulations. That's quite a waste of time.
Rach. Yeah.
You have scratches all over you. What happened?
Well, it's my cat. What?
Oh, yeah, I got a cat. I don't want a cat.
Oh, don't worry, it's not a cat. Yeah.
You guys, this cat is nothing like my grandmother's cat.
It's not sweet. It's not cute.
I even dragged a string on the ground...
...and it just flipped out and scratched the hell out of me.
And I swear... I know this sounds crazy,
but every time this cat hisses at me I know it's saying, "Rachel."
Doesn't sound as crazy as paying $1000 for a cat.
You paid $1000 for a cat when you owe me 300?
Well, I was gonna let you play with it.
Hey.
Hmm, Did you talk to Gary about the moving in thing?
Yes, I did, and I think you should do it.
What?
He's a great guy, y'know? and he loves you a lot. You are a very lucky lady.
You are useless.
Freaking out about commitment is the one thing you can do...
The one thing! And you can't even do that right! God!
Sorry.
If he asked me, I'd move in with him.
get out of here, good-for-nothing.
Hey, Chandler. Hey, Gar.
Hey, sweetie.
Can I talk to you for a second? Yeah. .
Okay
You look very pretty today.
Thanks. Okay.
Here's the thing. Yeah.
You know, I really want this relationship to move forward.
Because if you're not moving forward, you know, you're just moving backwards.
Now, that's not true. If you're not moving forward, you're staying still.
And staying still is good. Watch this.
Phoebe? Yeah?
I want you to move in with me.
That is so sweet.
But don't you think that it's a little it's too soon?
I mean, there's so much we don't know about each other.
Oh, okay. I get it.
I just—I don't want us to jump into something that we're not ready for, you know.
I really don't want to mess up what we have.
I'm just—I'm worried it's gonna be a big mistake.
Yeah.
Which is why my answer is yes.
Really? Uh-huh.
Uh-huh! You're so happy.
Monica, stop throwing it so hard.
We're on the same team.
Four hours? You guys have been doing this for four hours?
That's right, baby.
All right. Let me in. No, no. Don't do it.
What?
He's a dropper.
Oh, yeah. That's right.
I'm not a dropper.
It's really a three-person game, you know?
It's throwing and catching.
All right.
Oh, oh, it's so hard.
Don't worry, guys. It's not a cat.
Oh, my... Oh, good God.
I give up, you guys. I don't know what I'm gonna do with this thing.
Baking it didn't help, huh?
Why don't you just take it back to where you got it?
I tried. They won't take her back.
Maybe that's because she's a minion of the Antichrist.
Rach, why won't they take it back?
Well, they said they would, but would only give me store credit.
What am I gonna do, get a thousand regular cats?
If you want, you can keep it until you find out what to do with it.
No, Mon, that's not the point.
I'm out a thousand dollars.I'm all scratched up
and I'm stuck with this stupid cat that looks like a hand.
Oh, my God. The cat's made my eyes water.
Don't throw it to me.
My vision's been compromised.
Oh, God. Okay. Okay.
It's okay. Man, that was close.
Yeah, you almost overreacted to something.
We have great news. We're moving in together. Isn't it great?
Congratulations. That's great.I know, I'm so excited.
So am I.
Well, you're not more excited than I am. No way. I'm the most excited. Ha.
Okay, I'll see you at the station later.
Okay, yeah, I'll see you later. Don't forget about the moving-in.
So you're moving in with him? What happened?
I couldn't tell him no. He got so sad.
But maybe it'll be all right.
I do really like him a lot. and probably do it eventually anyway.
And plus, think of all the money I'll save on stamps.
Why, do you write him a lot?
No, I just heard when people live together, they split the cost of stamps. Don't they?
Yeah, yeah. That's right.
Oh, I'm sorry, the oven mitts really freaked me out.
Hey, honey.
Okay, so did you find any apartments? Anything in Brooklyn Heights?
No, nothing.
Oh, really? Yeah.
Nothing at all? No.
As soon as something opens up, we'll move right in.
Unless it doesn't have a pool. I need a pool.
Phoebe, can I talk to you for a second? Uh-huh.
Take a seat. Okay.
You okay? You feel all right?
Yeah, I feel great because we're moving in together.
So you, uh.You checked the paper for listings in Brooklyn Heights, right?
You-you checked the Post?
Yeah, uh-huh, there was nothing.
Can I get some water? In a minute.
You checked today's Post?
Um, yeah, today's.
Hmm. Because, uh, this is today's Post.
And, uh, these are the listings I found.
Brooklyn Heights, two bedrooms.
Brooklyn Heights, one bedroom.
Brooklyn Heights, Brooklyn Heights, Brooklyn Heights.
Oh, are these for rent?
I thought people were just bragging.
Let me tell you what I think might be going on here.
No, no, don't look at the table. Look at me.
Okay, I think somebody asked someone to move in with him.
And I think someone said yes, but now she's having doubts...
...because things are moving too fast for someone.
Does that sound at all possible to you?
Yes, yes. Yes, fine, I am someone.
You want me to say it? I have doubts.
I'm sorry.
Phoebe. Yeah?
Phoebe, it's okay that you feel this way.
I mean, it is soon, and there's a lot of things we don't know about each other.
I just figured everything I know about you, I really like.
The things I don't know, I get to learn in a place with both our names on the mailbox.
That's so sweet.
Sweetheart,
but none of that matters if it's too soon for you.
It's fine. We don't have to move in together. I just want you to be happy.
Living with you would make me happy.
Phoebe, you don't have to say that.
No, I really wanna live with you. I wanna move in with you.
Are you sure?
Yes. Definitely, yes.
Let's live in an apartment that we both live in.
Oh, that's great.
Oh, wait, one sec. One sec.
Hey, you. Behind the glass.
Who are you looking at?
I've always wanted to say that every time I was in one of these rooms...
...which was never.
Show cat. Quality show cat.
Show cat. Oh, my God.
What's wrong with your baby?
That's not a baby. That's a cat.
Ew, it's creepy looking. .
Oh, no. no, it's actually very sweet. It's very sweet. Look.
Yeah. Do you want it?
Ha, ha. No, I hate cats.
Well, so then what are you doing to me? Okay? Just get out of here, all right? Move on.
Jeez
Wow, what an unusual cat.
Yes, thank you. Exactly. You want it?
Maybe. I was thinking about getting a cat. I was just gonna go to the shelter, but...
Okay. Why not?
Oh, terrific. That'll be $2,000.
Ha. What? Okay, a thousand.
I thought you wanted me to adopt your cat?
Well, I do, but you're gonna have to look at this as more of an investment than a cat.
Okay, yeah. I just wanted a cat.
Okay, okay, okay.
Obviously, you know how to haggle...
...so I'm not gonna try and take you on, okay?
So $800, and I don't call the copswhich I should because you are robbing me blind.
Blind. Just take the cat, leave the money and run away. Just run away.
Damn it. Ugh.
Can't you at least smile or something?
Okay, did anybody just hear that? Anybody?
I'm starving.
Come on, guys. Suck it up. We're closing in on 10 hours.
It's gut-check time.
I don't know who made you the boss. We invented this game.
Please. I made this game what it is.
Not fun anymore?
I'm still hungry.
All right, there's some pizza at my place. We can eat with one hand, right?
Are you with me? I am.
All right, let's go. Come on.
Let's go, Team Monica.
All right, we can work out the name later.
Rachel, what is your cat doing in one of my bowls?
It's not. I'm defrosting a chicken.
Oh, I sold, uh, Mrs. Whiskerson.
Oh, thank God.
Did you get your money back?
Yeah, $1500.
Wow, you made a profit?
I just came for the red velvet pillow.
Oh yeah, There you go. Thanks, Rachel.
And, uh, don't forget, you can come visit her any time you want.
Oh, good. Great. I'll keep that in mind.
Ahem, hey. So what is this? some kind of snake or something?
I really like waking up with you. I like waking up with you too.
Oh, it's such a beautiful morning.
I could stay here all day.
That would be great.
We could have breakfast in bed.
Wait, just a second.
Oh, no.
All right. Come on, Monica. Look alive. Come on, look alive.
Oh, good. You're all up.
Phoebe, it's six o'clock in the morning. Why aren't you at Gary's?
Oh, yeah. That's over. What?
Come on, Gary's such a great guy. Whatever the problem, you can work it out.
He shot a bird. Oh, that is over.
I'm sorry. That's terrible.
Phoebe， Are you okay?
Yeah, yeah, I'll be all right.
Oh, hey, here, Pheebs.
Oh. Nah, I don't feel like playing.
It's okay. It's okay.
Just pretend that it didn't happen, okay? No one needs to know.
Phoebe's not an official ball player.I mean, only official ball players can drop the ball.
All right. Okay. I'm starving!
Phoebe, honey, you wanna get breakfast?
Yeah. Okay. Okay, let's race. First one there wins. Ha, ha.
You guys wanna eat here? Yeah.
Oh, man, that was great, huh?
Can you believe how long we threw that ball around?
Yeah, It is amazing it lasted that long.
I know. My arm is killing me.
No, I meant with the dropper over here.
You know, how did I get this reputation as a dropper? Okay?
I am anything but a dropper.
Ross.
What's going on?
Well, my eye is a little itchy.
Uh, mine too. Yeah.
Wow, it's really red. You should go see my eye doctor.
Richard? I'm not gonna go see your ex-boyfriend.
Richard, that's all I ever hear. Richard, Richard, Richard.
Since we've been going out, I think I've mentioned his name twice.
Okay. So Richard, Richard.
It's not Richard, okay? It's this new guy. He's really good.
I'm sorry. I'm not going to an eye doctor.
Oh, God. Here we go. What?
Any time anything comes close to touching her eye or anyone else's.she, like, freaks out.
Watch.
Ross, come on.
All right, fine. I have a weird thing with my eye. Can we not talk about it please?
All right.
Hey, Rach. You know that great song?
Um, "Me, myself and eye."
Aah! Monica. Come on.
Does anyone wanna get some lunch? All those in favor, say "eye."
Ross, stop it. Come on.
How much did I love The King and "Eye."
Chandler.
Me too, me too.
Just stop it. That's enough. Come on.
You okay there, man? Yeah. I got too excited.
Friends  S05E22  The One With Joey's Big Break
All right, I gotta go. I'm taking Ben to the park.
Oh, give him a kiss for me. All right. Bye.
Bye. Bye. Later.
I am so sorry you got caught in the middle of that.
I didn't mean to be so out there, but I am furious with him.
Calm down?
I'm trying, but, man, that guy can push my buttons.
Why are you so mad at him?
Look, I don't wanna talk about it, okay? Well, it seems like...
You wanna be on my list too? Keep talking.
Has anyone seen my list, by the way?
Uh, no. What's it look like?
Um, a piece of paper and it says "Ross."  I see.
Hey. I just got off the phone with Estelle. and guess what.
I got the lead in a movie.
You got the lead in a movie? That's amazing! What's the movie about?
Oh, it's called Shutterspeed. It's really cool.
Yeah, um, I meet this girl in the subway and we fall in love in, like, a day, right?
And then she disappears. But I find out where she lives.
And when I get there, this old lady answers the door. I say, "Where's Betsy?"
Right? And she says, "Betsy's been dead 10 years."
Ooh. Chilling.
Oh, and the best part is we're filming in the desert outside of Vegas.
You know what that means, buddy. Yeah, I know that means buddy
Road trip. Yeah, we can rent a car. I just have to be there by Tuesday.
Oh, wait. My grandmother's dead.
Well, uh, we can talk about that too, Pheebs.
No, no, her cab.
She probably won't be using it. You could drive it to Las Vegas.
All right. Thanks, Pheebs.
What are we gonna do about my job?
Oh, uh, not go. All right, great. Road trip, baby.
Is this okay with you?
Chandler, you don't have to ask for my permission.
You can go. Thank you.
Hey, Rach, come on, We're gonna be late for the eye doctor appointment
All right. Let's get this over with. Ugh.
Oh, no.
Look what I did.
I mean, look at this mess.I mean, we're gonna probably have to clean this up, you know?
I mean, we're gonna have to reschedule.
If you thought that this mess was gonna bother me, you are wrong.
All right, let's go, Blinky.
Chandler.
Oh, hey, Joey. What's up?
I can't decide which route to take to Vegas.
Hey, you've traveled a lot, right? Yeah, I've been around. Okay.
So which route should I take? The northern route or the southern route?
Ooh, if you take the north route, there's a man in Illinois with a beard of bees.
Great. Problem solved.
But on the southern route, there's a chicken that plays tic-tac-toe.
Well, back to square one.
Oh, I know a way that you can decide.
All right, I'm gonna ask you a series of questions and you answer as quickly as you can.
Yes.
Good. But wait.
Here we go. Now I want you to relax.
Take a deep breath.
Clear your mind.
Which do you like better peanut butter or egg whites? Peanut butter.
Which would you rather be a fireman or a swimmer?
Swimmer.
Who would you rather sleep with Monica or Rachel?
Monica.
I always thought it'd be Rachel.
No thinking, no thinking.
Tie or ascot? Ascot.
North route or south route? North.
Bam, there you go. Huh? Wow.
That was incredible. Beard of bees here I come.
Hey. Oh, this guy again.
Hey, what's up?
Uh, not much. You guys wanna see a movie tonight?
Sure. What do you wanna see?
I don't know. Um...
I know how we can decide. Phoebe, show him your game.
Um, no, thank you.
What's with her?
I don't know. But I know how we can decide.
Okay, I'm gonna ask you questions and you answer real quick, okay?
What do you like better action or comedy?
Action.
Who would you rather sleep with, Monica or Rachel?
Dude, you are sick.
Oh. I'm sorry. I forgot you had that whole Rachel thing.
Oh, my God. What does that thing do?
Uh, that's an eye removal machine.
All right, I'm out of here. I'm kidding. I'm kidding.
Hi, Rachel, I'm Dr. Miller.Monica told me you were a little nervous,
but don't worry everything's gonna be just fine.
So we're done then. Almost, but first we gotta start.
This is the glaucoma test.  Uh-huh.
Sit down.
Okay.
Put your chin here.
Now, you'll feel a small puff of air in each eye.
Uh, a what?
A small puff of air. Now, come on.
Here we go. All right.
One, two, three.
I'm sorry. All right.
Ha, ha, I'm gonna stay in here this time. Okay.
Ready? Uh-huh.
One, two... I'm sorry.
Y'know what, I'm gonna hold her head.
That's okay. Okay.
One two... Oh! I'm sorry.
You know what? You're young. You probably don't have glaucoma.
Great!! It was very, very nice to meet you, sir.
Ow! Hey, What are you doing?! Are you crazy? 
Okay. You got a small, minor infection in that left eye.
I want you to take these drops three times a day and you'll be as good as new.
Yeah, no, I don't-I don't put things in my eye.
Okay then. I guess we'll see you back here in three months.
Great. And I'll fit you for a glass eye.
Okay, just give me the damn drops.
Dr. Miller?
P-E-C-F-D.
Very good, Monica.
You know where they are. I sure do.
And you don't get one.
Y'know, I-I gotta tell ya, those eye drops are a miracle. My eye is a 100% better.
They're still in my coat. Damn.
Hey. Hey, you ready to go? Yeah, Listen, how cold is it gonna be there?
Do I need a coat or will all these sweater vests be enough?
What? I love you.
Man, I wish Ross was coming with us. Y'know? I'm gonna miss him.
Thanks a lot. I just got that jerk out of my mind.
Hey, so where are we staying? Is the movie putting us up in a big hotel suite?
Uh, no, not really. It's an independent film. y'know? So we don't have a real big budget.
I figured I'd just stay in your room.
I see, but once you get your first paycheck, you'll be springing a big hotel suite, right?
Lead in the movie, they must be paying you a lot.
Oh, yeah. Check this out.
For every dollar Shutterspeed makes one penny of it goes right in Joey's pocket.
So you don't get paid unless the movie makes money?
Did you not hear the plot of the movie?
"She's been dead for 10 years."
I'm gonna be a millionaire.
Hey. Hey.
I just wanted to say goodbye to you guys.
And to see if maybe you guys will place a little bet for me.
Twenty bucks on black 15.
You got it. All right.
All right. Bye-bye, now.Bye, you guys.
I'm gonna say goodbye at the car. Okay.
Anybody wanna say goodbye to me at the car?
Oh, honey, I'll say goodbye to you at the car if you don't mind the pus.
See you.
But wait a minute. The pus is good. It means it's healing.
Hey, Pheebs. What you reading?
Pheebs?
Hello?
Phoebe?
Phoe-Phoebe! Come on.
Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't see you there.
Pheebs, are you mad at me or something?
'Cause if are please, tell me what it is I did!
Well, if you don't know, I can't help you. Well, I don't know.
Well, I can't help you.
Okay, well, whatever it is, I am very, very sorry. Okay?
Apology accepted.

All right.
Phoebe now come on!  will you please tell me what it is that made you so mad at me?
I don't know. I don't remember.
Well, if you can't remember, can't we just forget about this?
Oh, no. I am mad at you. I know that much.
But I am sorry about the "fat ass" thing because you actually have a very sweet little heinie.
Man, I'm getting pretty tired. You're might have to take over soon.
We've been driving for a half-hour.
And you haven't looked at the road once.
Don't worry. It's out there.
I think I just need lunch. Yeah.
You wanna eat? My treat.
Isn't that Ross' money?
Yeah, okay. Ross' treat.
Where do you wanna eat? I don't know.
Oh, hey, I know how we can decide.
All right, uh, I'm gonna ask you questions.and then you have to answer real fast, okay?
So, uh, clear your mind. Clear it right out. Clear it out.Okay.
Would you rather be too wet or too dry? Too dry.
Do you believe in ghosts?  yes or no?  No.
Is this movie gonna be my big break? No.
What? Yes.
Dude, you said no.
I also said yes.
You don't think this is gonna be a big break for me? No! Ahhh!!!
I don't believe this.
Look, Joe, I just, I just don't want you to get your hopes up too high.
What are you talking about? I'm the lead in a movie.
They're not even paying you.
This doesn't even sound like a real movie.
Y'know what? I don't need this! Okay? I don't know why you're dumping all over my big break.
Because, Joe, I don't think this is going to be your big break.
Is that why you're on this trip? Huh? To make me feel like a loser?
'Cause if it is, I'll tell ya, I-I-I'd rather be alone.
You don't want me on the trip? Not if you're like this.
Tell you what,the next time you ask me a question like that, I'll lie.
Yeah, I don't want you on the trip.
All right, fine. Why don't you pull over? I'll get out now.
Fine.
Get out. You're not supposed to stop on a bridge.
Get out. Fine.
Wait. Wait. There's no sidewalk.
Yeah. I'm gonna die here.
Okay, are you mad at me because my hair gel smells?
No.
Are you angry with me because I said your handwriting is childlike?
No, that made me feel precious.
Oh, I know. Is it because he's always correcting people's grammar?
You know, "whom, whom."
Sometimes it's "who."
Yeah? Sometimes it's...
Oh, did you beat him at a board game?He turns into such a baby when he starts to lose.
Okay, I'm the baby.
Hey. Stop it
Hey. Chandler! What are you doing here?
Joey kicked me out of the car on the George Washington bridge!
Why?
I don't know. He went crazy. Y'know, We were playing that game where you ask a question and you answer it really fast.
Oh, that game should not be played without my supervision.
Well, I don't know what made him mad.
All I said was that, uh, I didn't think this was gonna be his big break...
...that this movie wasn't gonna do anything for him...
...and that uh, y'know it didn't sound like a real movie.
Okay, he should've pushed me off the bridge.
What's in the bag?
Oh, I figured you guys would all be mad at me...
...so I got you some gifts that I found on the side of the road.
Who wants the teddy bear with one leg? I do.
Okay.
Not even close. Okay, then y'know what? I need help! I can't do this!
Okay! All right! Let's do it!
All right. Sit down.
All right, put your head back. All right. Yes. Okay.
Now, open your eyes. Okay, they are.
How many fingers am I holding up? Four.
Oh, my God, I was thinking four.
Really? Yes.
All right, y'know what? why don't we start with a practice one, okay?
No drops. Great.
On three. One, two, three.
Now my pillow's all wet.
Well, well, you said it was practice!
Then why did you move? Because I knew you were lying.
All right. Come here. Come on. What are you doing?
Monica, Stop it! Oh, my God, stop it.
I am going… I'm going--Turn it over!
Aah!I am going to get Get these drops in your eye.
Oh, my God. You really are freakishly strong.
Aah! Aah! Monica, stop it!
Damn, it's empty.
Wow. y'know if Joey and Chandler walked in right now, we could make a fortune.
Ooh, that is definitely Chandler, Joey or Ross.
Or Rachel.
Hello?
It's Joey.
I'm so glad you called. Chandler told me what happened. He's really upset.
Not as upset as he's gonna be when he finds out what I did with his sweater vests.
What did you do to his sweater vests?
Let's just say there's a well-dressed pack of dogs in Ohio.
Monica, listen, is Phoebe there? I gotta ask her something about the car.
Yeah, she's here. Hold on a second.
Hey, dude. Hey, Pheebs.
Listen, this wooden box keeps sliding out from under the seat. What is it?
Oh, that's my grandma.
And thanks, Joey. She's having a really great time.
Is that Joey? Is that Joey? Let me talk to him.
Joey, Chandler's here. He was wondering if...
Okay, I guess he ran out of change.
Y'know, He won't even talk to me. How am I gonna apologize to him if he won't even talk to me?
Maybe you should send him something.
So when he gets to Las Vegas, he'll know that you're sorry.
That's a good idea. I wonder where I could get a basket of porn?
Oh, no,  don't-don't say I'm sorry with porn! Really?
You know what you should send him? A carton of cigarettes. 'Cause that why he could trade it for protection. 
No. That's prison.
Okay, Pheebs. I know how we're gonna figure this out.
Okay. Clear your mind...
...and answer the first thing that comes into your head.
Okay?
What do you like better flora or fauna Fauna. Fauna.
Who would you rather be Simon or Garfunkle? Garfunkel.
Why are you mad at me? You said I was boring. Oh.
When did I say you were boring?
Oh, my God, I remember now. We were playing chess.
Phoebe, you and I have never played chess.
Oh, come on! Yes, remember that time on the frozen lake? We were playing chess, you said I was boring,
and then you took off your energy mask and you were Cameron Diaz!.
Okay, there's a chance this may have been a dream.
Hey. Stanley. Hey.
Your leading man is here. Let's get to work.
Um, slight change of plans. We've shut down.
What? Why?
It's a money thing. We don't have any.
Ha, ha. You're kidding, right? No.
What?
It's probably just temporary.
We're hoping to get more money soon, so if you could just, uh, hang out.
Hang out? How long?
I don't know. A week. Maybe two.
The money'll turn up. People always wanna invest in movies.
Hey, you're not rich, are you? No.
Worth a shot.
Well, Joey, let me know where you're staying, okay?
Hey, pal. Are you Joey Tribbiani? Yeah.
These got left for you. Thanks.
"Congratulations on your big break."
Hello?
Monica, it's Joey.
Hey, Joey.Aw, you remember me even though you're a big star.
Aw, come on. It'll be years before I forget you.
Joey, what's it like on a movie set, huh?
Do you have a dressing room? Do you have a chair with your name on it?
Uh, yeah, yeah, I got all that going on.
Listen, uh, make sure you tell Chandler he couldn't have been more wrong.
Uh-oh, I gotta go, Monica. My, uh, sushi's here.
Sorry about that. Thanks for waiting. Okay.
Everybody smile. Okay. Thanks a lot.
Enjoy your stay at Caesar's. We hope it's toga-rific.
Ugh. Kill me. Kill me now.
Hey, Rach, can you pass me the TV Guide?  Yeah.
Go!
What are you doing?
Get off! Oh, my God!
Hold it open. Okay. Aah!
We'll see you in about three or four hours.
Hello?
Hey, Joey! Hey, Pheebs. Listen, uh Can you do me a favor?
I forgot the PIN to my ATM card. Can you get it for me?
Sure. Where is it? Uh, I scratched it on the ATM machine on the corner.
Oh, so you're 5-6-3-9?
That's it! Thanks Pheebs!
Do you wanna talk to Chandler?
Is that Joey? Let me talk to him.
No. He didn't believe in my movie...
...which is a big mistake, because it is real. Real.
Y'know what? I've tried to apologize in all week. If I can't do it on the phone,
I'll go down there and do it in person.
Uhh Pheebs, I heard that. Uh, can you put him on?
Yeah.
Hey. Don't come out here.
No-no-no-no, I support you 100 percent and I wanna prove that to you in person.
I got that. I forgive you. Don't come out here.
Forgive me? You haven't taken my calls for a week.
Well, I'm totally over it Chandler. Friends forever.
Don't come out here.
Would you mind doing a picture with us?
Uh, what was that?
Uh, Entertainment Tonight.
Yeah, okay so, good talking to you and don't come out here. All right.
Friends  S05E23  The One In Vegas
Monica? I'm sorry I'm late.
Monica?
Phoebe?
I'm so sorry.
Have you been here long? That's okay.
What the hell took you so long?
Okay, you can't tell Chandler.
That I ran into Richard.
Which Richard? The Richard.
Richard Simmons? Oh, my God!
No, my ex-boyfriend Richard.
You know, the tall guy, mustache.
Okay, that actually makes more sense.
How was it?
It was, it was really nice. We started talking 
and I-I ended up having lunch with him.
That is so weird! I had a dream that you'd have lunch with Richard.
Really? But again, Simmons.
Go on. The strange part was he was really nice...
and he looks great, but I didn't feel anything at all!
 Ooh! So now why can't we tell Chandler?
Because it would totally freak him out
and tomorrow's our anniversary. I don't wanna spoil that.
Oh, I can't believe you guys lasted a whole year!
Wow, I owe Rachel 20 bucks.
What? On a totally different bet.
Hey!
It's almost our anniversary!
I know.
Can you believe it? One year ago today, I was just your annoying friend Chandler.
Aw, now you're just my annoying friend Chandler.
Huh.  I got you a present! Oh, but it's not 'til tomorrow!
I know, but you have to open it today. Okay.
Okay! There you go!
It's two tickets to Vegas! Wow.
Yeah! For this weekend!
Oh gosh, it would be perfect, we get to see Joey plus we get to start our anniversary celebration on the plane.
We can call it our "Plane-a-versary."
We have to?
No.
Okay this is great, but Joey said he didn't want any of us out there.
Oh, he just doesn't want us to go through any trouble.
Think of how excited he'll be when we go out and surprise him! 
Plus, we get to have our own "Anna-Vegas-ry"!
"A-Nevadaversary!"
Yeah, I think we should see other people.
We can go, right?
Yes. Okay! Great idea.
Okay, I'm gonna go too!
Y'know Pheebs, it's kind of our anniversary.
Oh please, you are not gonna ditch again like you did with London.
Ditch you?  Phoebe, you were pregnant with the triplets!
Uh-huh. Great story. I'm going.
Hi. Hey.
Hey, you guys, Listen, this weekend we're all gonna go to Las Vegas to surprise Joey!
Including me!
You wanna go?!
I can take a couple days off work.
Of course you can take a couple days off, because this trip includes me!
Oh no, wait a minute, wait, I've got a presentation tomorrow. I can't miss that.
I've got tickets to the Van Gogh exhibit. I've been waiting like a year for this.
So Rach，you and I could fly out together Saturday.
Sounds great. Yeah? All right I'll call the airlines. Okay.
Yeah, Y'know，that would be nice actually, to have the apartment to myself for a night.
Oh yeah, so you can walk around naked.
No, so I can be by myself. Y'know? Have a little alone time.
Naked alone time.
No! Phoebe Just because I'm alone doesn't mean I wanna walk around naked.
You live alone, you don't walk around naked.
Uh-huh. Why does it takes me so long to answer the door?
So far, is this trip to Las Vegas better or worse than the trip to London?
So far, it's pretty much the same, Pheebs.
Okay, What about after I give you these candies?
Yeah, I guess it's a little better now. Ha, ha.
Ah-ha! Okay, Las Vegas, 1. London, 0.
I'll be back.
Happy Plane-a-versary.
Aww! I love you!
Can I give you your present now? Okay!
Oh man! don't tell me I did this.
I love "I forgot the present" fake-out!
How do you feel about the, "I really did forgot the present, please forgive me" not fake out?
Oh that's okay. Don’t worry about it, you can give it to me when we get back.
Ohh that's the worse thing that can happen on an anniversary ever!
Oh good! All right, so you decided to tell him about the Richard thing.
What-what Richard thing?
Oh, no.
What "Richard thing"? Simmons. Go with Simmons.
Okay, I umm, I ran into Richard yesterday.
and he asked me if I wanted to go for a bite and I did.
The only reason I didn't tell you because.
I knew you'd get mad and I didn't want to spoil our anniversary.
I'm not mad.
Really? Oh yeah! 
Yeah,so you-you bumped into Richard! You grabbed a bite!
No big deal.
Great.
Okay, London, 1.
Oh, look what happened.
Huh, check me out.
I'm in my kitchen...
...naked.
I'm picking up an orange.
I'm naked.
lighting the candles.
naked, and carefully.
Oh, my God! That's Rachel, naked!
I can't look at that. I am looking at this.
Okay, vivid colors, expressive brush strokes.
Unless she wants me to be looking at that.
She knows I'm home.
She knows I can see her.
What kind of game is she playing?
I think maybe someone's lonely tonight.
Oh, Dr. Geller.Stop it. You're being silly. Ha, ha.
Or am I?
Darn it!
Hey.
May I come in?
Uh, yeah, if you want to.
Do you want me to?
Yeah, sure?
So do I.
Okay, Rach, before anything happens...
...I wanna lay down a couple of ground rules.
This is just about tonight.
I won't go through with this if it'll raise the question of "us."
Okay? I just want this to be...
...about what it is.
And, um...what is that, Ross?
The physical act of love.
What, are you crazy?
Oh so-so you weren't trying to entice me just now with your nakedness?
Oh, God. You saw me?
You weren't trying to entice me with your nakedness?
Noo!! No! You thought, you actually thought I wanted to have sex with you?
No.
No!
No, no, no, no.
Hey, you guys, wait!
You guys. This place is so much better than London. Okay?
This lady dressed like Cleopatra gave me a coupon,
Ninety-nine cent steak and lobster dinner. Huh.
Phoebe, You don't eat animals.
For ninety-nine cents I'd eat you.
Okay, I can totally settle down here. It's got everything I could ever want.
Including Joey! Look!
Oh! Look! Hey! Oh, my God.
Hey, Joey!
Hey!! Wow! Hi.
Love your condoms, my man.
What-what are you guys doing here? I thought I told you not to come.
Why are you dressed as a gladiator?
Uh, because I'm shooting a scene right now.Yeah, I uh, I play a gladiator.
Uh, y'know what? Hold-hold on a second.
Can we cut? My friends are here. I'm gonna take a break.
Who are you talking to?
The director.Uh, her.
All right, all right, it's not a gladiator movie. I work here.
Why? What happened?
The movie shutdown because they ran out of money,
so I'm working here 'til it starts up again, if it ever does.
I'm so sorry. Such a drag.
Look, I'm sorry I didn't tell ya. I'm sorry man.
No-no, that's okay, apparently there's a new policy where we don't have to share everything with everybody.
I knew you weren't okay with that.
So you're a gladiator!
Yeah, what-what's going on?
Monica had lunch with Richard.
Dawson?
No...But that would've been so cool!
Her boyfriend Richard.
It meant nothing. Okay? After all this time, how can you not trust me?
When you go lunching with hunky moustache men and don't tell me about it!
You're right. I'm sorry. I should've told you.
Thanks. Aww, there we go.
Now I love Vegas.
I promise you next time I absolutely will tell you.
"Next time"?
Ooh, so close.
There's not gonna be a next time! You can not ever see him again!
I cannot see him? You can't tell me what to do.
That's so funny, because I think I just did!
Oh y'know what? If you act like this, I don't even want to be around you. Fine with me!
Fine! Happy Anniversary!
Whoa! Whoa! Guys! Please! Come on, come on.This is obviously a misunderstanding.
No, it's not. What're you talking about?
Hey-hey don't look at me! I just work here!
Okay, um, Ross? I'm a little warm, so I'm gonna be taking off my sweater. Now, 
I'm just letting you know...this is not an invitation to the physical act of love.
Yep, that's hilarious.
I'm sorry. I'm done. I'm done.
You know, last night was embarrassing for you too.
No, not really. I mean I just don't embarrass that easily.
What? You totally get embarrassed.
No, I don't. Ross, I think I'm just a more secure person than you are.
Is that so? Yeah.
Hey, lady! I don't care how much you want it, okay?
I am not gonna have sex with you in the bathroom!
Hey, You know, in Roman times, this was more than just a hat.
Really? Yeah, sure, sure.
They would scrub the floors with it!
They'd use it to get the mud off their shoe.
And sometimes underneath the horse would get dirty.So they would stick it right...
Joey, I uh! I can't believe this is how I'm spending my anniversary.
I'll take you someplace nice.
Look! A guy tipped me $100 bucks today. Whoa!
Yeah-yeah, He was playing blackjack for an hour and he won $5000.
Can you believe that? $5,000!
Y'know, If I won $5000, I'd join a gym.
y'know build up my upper body and hit Richard from behind with a stick.
Wait a minute! Why don't I do what that guy did?
I'll take this $100, and turn it into $5000
...And then I'll turn that into enough money to get my movie going again!
Good luck.
Chandler! I don't need luck.
I've thought this through. I see.
Thank you. Thanks.
I can't believe this. This is like the worst night ever.
Y'know Monica you had a minor setback in your relationship with Chandler.
Big deal. It's only Chandler.
I am so sorry.
This is crazy! it's such a stupid argument. I don't even wanna see Richard again.
So go fix it. Go find Chandler! He's probably up in your room.
Tell him that you're sorry and that you love him.
You're right, Phoebe. You're right. Thank you. Sure.
Yeah! Las Vegas! Number one!
Anybody lose this? Coming out.
Place your bet.
Dice her out.
Double or nothin'! Pay the front line!
So, uh, I'm on my way back to the bathroom.
All right, all right. Just keep walking, all right?
Ross! What are you... I am sorry, sir. I think he just really likes you.
Hey...You know that teacher who had a baby with her student?
What the? What…
Miss? Can I help you?
Yes. I'm sorry. Do you have any extra pants?
Uh, my friend seems to have had a little accident.
Can I change 100?  Changing 100.
Good luck, sir. Thanks.
Let's ride.
Thirteen. Hit me!
Oh, man!
Wait!
Chandler! You are not gonna believe this!
I have found my identical hand twin.
What?
My identical hand twin!
What's an identical hand twin?
It was incredible. The dealer's hands were exactly like mine.
It-it was like looking at my hands in a mirror!
Are you sure you weren't looking at your hands in a mirror?
Don't you see what this means?
I can forget about that stupid movie.
I'm gonna be a millionaire!
How?
Look, I don't have it all worked out yet.But it's gotta mean big money.
Come on, identical hands!
Again, I must go back to...how?
This is Vegas, man.
People will pay to see freaky stuff!
Okay, How much would you pay to see this hand...twice? Huh?
Y'know, I-I can't really put a price on that Joe.
Hey, are you un-supporting me again?
No. No.I support you 100 percent. I just didn't, I didn't get it right away. 
Now I'm caught up. Identical hand twins.
It's a million-dollar idea!
Hey! Pheebs!
I found my identical hand twin!
Oh, you're so lucky!
So where's Monica? Did you guys make up? No.
But she just came up here.
That was Joey.
I wonder where she is? It's so weird.
Yeah, well, She's probably talking to Richard.
Would you stop that?
Do you wanna know the first thing she said when she came back from her lunch with Richard? 
She didn't feel anything for him. She loves you.
Really? Yes.
She feels terrible.
She really wants to make up. You've gotta find her.
Okay.
Good.
I should really start wearing hats.
Welcome to Las Vegas.
Thank you! Enjoy your flight? Yes, I did. Thank you very much, it was excellent. 
Hope you had a nice flight. Oh, it was the best.
Previously on Friends:
Don't come out here.
you don't tell Chandler.I ran into Richard. Which Richard?
My ex-boyfriend.
That's the worse thing that can happen on an anniversary ever!
Oh good! All right, so you decided to tell him about the Richard thing.
Oh, no.
You can not ever see him again! You can't tell me what to do.
That's so funny, because I think I just did!
I have found my identical hand twin. What's an identical hand twin?
A guy with my identical hands. I'm gonna be a millionaire!
you actually thought I wanted to have sex with you?
No.
You know, last night was embarrassing for you too.
I just don't embarrass that easily.
I think the check-in is that way. Ah.
Ah, kids love me.
Hey! Phoebe! Hi. You guys are here!
Yay! What'd you do? Did you go to a costume party?
Let me guess. Um, Pancho Villa.
And you're Bob Saget.
Pancho Villa?
What are you talking about, Pheebs? I don't--
Oh, my God! You drew on me?
Hey, you wet my pants!
Whoa, what kind of party was this?
Ross, I've been walking around like this since the plane! I can—you have so crossed a line.
Rash, wait. The men's room is that way.
Oh! What?
That's like the third time that lady's won on a machine I was playing.
Oh. I bet she's one of those people.
M-M-Mole people?
What? No, a lurker.
Oh. What's a lurker?
Okay when you're playing a machine and it hasn't paid out,
...a lurker waits for you to give up and then
Kills you?
No, they swoop in and steal your jackpot.
Oh. Mm-hm.
How do you know about this? My nana used to do it.
That's how she paid for my dance-Karate lessons.
Dance karate?
Yes, it's a deadly...
...but beautiful sport.
It won't come off. What?
It won't come off.
Oh, my God. Rash, are-are-are you sure?
No, actually I took it off then I drew it back on.
Hey-hey-hey you made it!
Who's your friend? He's hot.
Thanks, man.
Listen, I talked to Chandler, and I'm sorry about the movie.
Don't be sorry.
I don't need it anymore. I found my identical hand twin.
Your what?
My identical hand twin. The person whose hands are exactly like mine!
This is a gold mine.
What?
That won't make you any money.
Okay. Well, if that's how you feel about it, fine.
None of you will live with me in my hand-shaped mansion.
Except, uh, you. You can live in the thumb.
Friends  S05E24  The One In Vegas

Wait Chandler, What are you doing?
What's it look like? I'm going home.
What? Wait! Why?
Chandler.
Chandler, wait.
I’m sorry, I was just playing for one second.
I was trying to find you to tell you that, look if you don't want me to see Richard again, I won't.
He means nothing to me.
Oh, come on. I was there.
I know he's the love of your life.
Not anymore.
Really?
Really.
All right?
Let's forget about going home stuff and celebrate our anniversary.
Okay, this is empty.
Yeah, I wanted to make a dramatic scene, but I hate packing.
Uhh, hey. Where's the other guy?
Which guy?
He's kinda tall, dark hair, hand looks exactly like this? See?
I don't know about the hands, but the guy that was here before me just went to the bathroom.
0Kay.
How you doing? Very busy.
Right. Okay.
Yes, hello. I have a question.
Um, I used your pen to draw on my friend's face.
A beard and a mustache.
Thank you.
No, she didn't think so.
I know. It's like-Anyway...

What do we do?
Yeah. Uh-huh.

Yeah, it's not coming off.
What? What else did he say?
Um, he said he thought I was funny.
Okay, look. Let's just go downstairs...
...we'll have some fun, and you will forget all about it.
Ross, no! There's no way I am leaving this room looking like this!
Come on, Rach. It's not that bad.
Ross, I am a human doodle!
Look, Just because some idiot drew on your face doesn't mean you shouldn't have any fun! Okay?
And besides, hey-hey-hey no one is even gonna look at you. Okay? 
This is Vegas. Hello? There are tons of other freaks here.

Come on. No one will notice. I swear.

But who cares, because it's all on me.
That is one big drink.
Macadamia nut?
Um, wow! That's some pricey nut.
Really like those macadamia nuts, huh?
Nope.
Get out of here, you lurker!
