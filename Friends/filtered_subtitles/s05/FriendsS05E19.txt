我真替乔伊感到骄傲012---I am so proud of Joey.
他竟然要演《法网游龙》  我知道012---He's gonna be on Law and Order! I know.
可是你不觉得  叫《网法游龙》比较对吗012---But don't you think it should be called Order and Law?
不对  得先有法律才能去网啊012---No because first they arrest the guy and then they try him.

很抱歉  但有就是有012---I'm sorry, but you were.
而且就算有  谁要跟她搭讪  也应该是个单身的男人012---Okay? And besides, if anyone should be hitting on her ..it's the guy who's single
也应该是个有搞头的人嘛012---the guy that who-who-who can do something about it.

抱歉  我以为你是乔伊的另一个阿妈012---Ha, ha, I thought you were Joey's other grandmother.
我还猛说英文012---I've done it again.
她是我的头号影迷012---Nonnie's my biggest fan.

好像不见了  还在公寓里  但一定是不见了012---but I kind of lost it. Oh, I know it's in the apartment, but I definitely lost it.
那我要怎么跟摩妮卡说  她今晚就要戴012---Well, what am I going to tell Monica? She wants to wear them tonight!
叫她戴自己的耳环  这就是她的耳环012---Tell her to wear her own earrings. These are her earrings.
不  不会吧012---Nooo! Nooooo!
你把摩妮卡的耳环借我   我不能借她的东西012---You lent me Monica's earrings? I'm not allowed to borrow her stuff.
为什么  因为我都会弄丢的012---Why not? Because I lose her stuff!

谢谢012---Oh. Thanks.
你知道  我不是真的喜欢八岁男孩012---You want to see, I don't actually like 8-year-old boys.
我在等着你找钱012---All I'm looking for is the money.
拿去  别再帮我们送彼萨了012---Here you go. Now, stop bringing us pizzas, you.
我都快哭了012---I'm gonna try. Ha, ha. Okay.
不客气012---You're welcome.
你就是不想看我得手  对吧012---You couldn't let me have her, could you?
什么012---What?
我真的很喜欢这个女孩  你干嘛要来凑热闹012---This is a girl I really like and you had to swoop in there!
怎么了   钱德冲着外送辣妹打情骂俏012---What's going on? Chandler was totally flirting with the hot delivery girl.
真是多谢你了012---Thank you for that.
我没有打情骂俏012---I was not flirting.
没关系   我不在意  无所谓012---It's okay. I don't care. Ha, ha. It's fine.
什么  真的012---Really? Really?
小事一桩  我动不动也是这样012---It's no big deal. I do it all the time.
你动不动就跟人打情骂俏012---So, uh  Ahem. You flirt with guys all the time?
是啊  那又不代表什么  你不是也不代表什么意义吗012---Sure. It doesn't mean anything. Just like I know it doesn't mean anything with you.
对啊  但是有一点很不一样  你比我辣多了012---But there's a big difference. Sorry, You are a lot hotter than I am.
这是真的012---True story.
钱德  你真的介意012---Ha, ha. Chandler, This actually bothers you?
对  我是介意  我想很多人都会介意012---Yes, it does bother me! And I think it'd bother a lot of people.
瑞秋  你和罗斯在一起那时012---When you were going out with Ross,
他跟别的女人打情骂俏  你会不会介意012---did it bother you when he flirted with other women?
不会  他跟别的女人上床  我才会介意012---Uh, no. No, it bothered me when he slept with other women.
真是多谢了012---And thank you for that.
但其实我没啥好担心的  罗斯从来就不太会打情骂俏012---But I never had anything to worry about.Ross was never very good at the flirting thing.
什么  什么012---What ? What ? Ha, ha.
你在说什么  对你不就有效012---What are you talking about? It worked with you.
你说的真是对极了012---Oh! Y'know what? you're right.
我们认识  你对我打情骂俏  九年后你终于追到我了012---Oh! We met, you flirted and then, bam, nine years later, you had me.
好  好  就这么办012---All right. All right.You know what I'm gonna do?
我再来点个披萨  等凯特琳来的时候012---I am gonna order another pizza. And when Caitlin gets here
我来让你们见识一下  我有多会打情骂俏012---you-you--I will show how well I flirt. 
我还能要到她的电话号码012---Yeah! I will, I will get her phone number! Oh, well
不是彼萨店的电话啦012---And not the one on the menu.
我找到了 谢天谢地  在哪里找到的012---I found it. Oh, thank God! Where was it?
在你的梳妆台上012---On your dresser.
那是原来的那一个012---Okay, that is the one we already have. Oh.

有人在吗012---Anybody home?

我祖母发现一定会难过到死掉012---It'll kill my grandmother if she finds out. Ha, ha.
怎么了   我那段被剪掉了012---Oh, what is it? Uh, they cut me out of the show.
什么012---What?
你确定012---Are you sure?
或许现在才轮到你上012---Maybe your scene's coming up.
不太可能  看到那个装尸体的袋子没012---Not likely. Because you see that body bag right there?
有啊  里头装的是我012---Yeah. I'm in it.
太糟糕了  你要怎么办012---This is terrible, what are you going to do?
不知道012---I don't know.
我的老祖母活着  就是为了看我演戏012---This little, old lady lives for my career.
上回《我们的日子》不要我  她差点难过到死掉012---When they dumped me off Days of Our Lives, she almost died.
那样很不妙012---That's not good.
你没在笑  别用那种表情  笑啊  大家继续笑012---You're not smiling. Not that face! Smile, everybody smile! Ha, ha.
乔伊  你怎么不实话实说   那又不能怪你012---Joey，Why don't you just tell her what happened? It's not your fault.
如果我们继续这样说话  会不会吓到她012---If we keep talking this way, aren't we gonna freak her out soon?
很快  马上就轮我上场了012---Oh, uh, soon. I'm gonna be on soon.
那就是我012---There I am!
不  山姆瓦特斯顿012---No.Sam Waterston!

她听不懂 〝你好〞  却知道《摩羯一号大行动》012---She doesn't know "hello," but she knows Capricorn One.
菲比  我要那副耳环  节目一演完我们就要出去了012---Phoebe! I have to have those earrings, we're going to leave as soon as the show is over
可是我已经还你了啊012---But I already gave them back to you.
不  没有啊012---No, you didn't.
好  我已经没还给你  我就是这样说的啊012---All right, I already didn't gave them back to you. That's what I said.
瑞秋  另一个耳环在哪里012---Ahem. Rachel，Where's that other earring?
菲比  不在这里012---It's not here, Pheebs. It's not here. Oh!
我昨晚有去钱德和乔伊那里012---I went to Joey and Chandler's last night!
好  记得要检查钱德的珠宝盒012---Okay! Make sure you check Chandler's jewelry box.
慢着  钱德有珠宝盒012---Wait a minute, Chandler has a jewelry box?
好了  时间紧迫  你要我现在就跟你解释012---Okay, we have like ten minutes. Do you want me to get into that now?!
嘿  菲比  那个素食彼萨  你吃得还习惯吗012---Hey Pheebs! How's that uh, vegetarian pizza working out for ya?
你和那些蔬菜  还真是有两下子  是吧012---You and those vegetables have a real thing going on, huh?
你干嘛怪里怪气的012---Why are you being weird?
你喜不喜欢012---Do you like it?
不喜欢  否则我就会问 〝你干嘛装可爱〞了012---No. That would be, "Why are you being cute?"
好吧  我在练习打情骂俏012---Okay. I'm working on my flirting.
原来如此  我没看出来012---Oh! I did not get that.
摩妮卡  你喜欢看 《法网游龙》吗012---So, uh, Monica,do you like the Law & Order?
喜欢  很好看012---Yeah, it's good. Oh.
我今天发现到了新的你012---See, I'm finding out all this stuff about you today,
好比你爱看《法网游龙》012---like you like the Law & Order 
还有你到处跟人打情骂俏012---and that you flirted with every guy in the Tri-State area!
好  我来问个清楚  你可以打情骂俏  我却不行012---Okay, let me get this straight. It's okay for you to flirt, but not for me?
真高兴我们把话说清楚了012---Oh, I'm so glad we cleared that up.
抱歉  但你听我说  男女有些事是不一样的012---Look, I'm sorry, but some things are different for men and women.
继续   教我一些男女的差别012---Go on, teach me about men and women.
虽然我已经教过你很多了  不过012---Okay. I've already taught you so much already, but whatever.
你跟男人打情骂俏的时候012---See when you flirt with a guy
你觉得只是打情骂俏  没啥大不了的012---you think, "I'm just flirting, no big deal."
但对方会觉得  他终于找到人上床了012---But the guy thinking, "Finally! Somebody who wants to sleep with me."
不可能  这是真的012---No way! It's true.
真可悲  这也是真的012---Well, that's pathetic. Again, true.
男人都这样吗   醒着的男人都适用012---This goes for all guys? All guys that are awake.
等我们上床睡觉后012---Then we go to sleep.
世界另一边的男人起床  继续做一模一样的事012---All guys from the other end of the world wake up and behave the exact same way.
好  又进广告了  我还是没跟她说012---All right. It's another commercial and I still haven't told her.
乔伊  这是像最后一段广告  你只剩十分钟012---Joey, This is like the last commercial. Look, You've got 10 minutes left.

嘿  找到没012---Hey. Did you find it?
耳环是没有  但我在沙发底下  找到我的太阳眼镜012---The earring? No. But look, I found my sunglasses under the couch!
我从去年夏天找到现在012---I've been looking for these since last summer.
那是我借你的太阳眼镜012---Those are my sunglasses. You borrowed them from me.
好  别激动  还你就是了012---Okay. Calm down. Here they are.
菲比012---Phoebe.
我们要怎么办   我不知道012---What do we do? I don't know. I don't know!
我们只好老实跟摩妮卡说了012---We'll just have to tell Monica, that's all.
老天  她一定会杀了我012---Oh, God! She's gonna kill me.
我可以跟她说是我弄掉的012---I suppose I could tell her it's just all my fault.
那就太好了012---Oh, that'd be great.
摩妮卡  我有话要跟你说012---Mon, could I talk to you?
好  什么事012---Yeah. What is it? Um
我弄丢了你一只耳环  对不起  我真的很抱歉012---I lost one of your earrings. I'm sorry. I am so, so sorry.
好吧  都弄丢了还能怎样012---All right, well, I mean, what can you do? If you lost it, you lost it.
我保证会赔你一副新的  我真的很愧疚012---I'll replace it, I promise. I feel so terrible.
没关系  你又不是故意的  不是012---That's fine. You didn't do it on purpose. No.
瞧你难过的  来012---Look at you. Come here.
好点了没  有啊  你最棒了012---You feel better? Ha, ha. Yeah. You're the best.
好  等一等012---Okay, wait a minute.
等一等  我不能这样012---Wait a minute, I can't do this.
听着  其实不是菲比弄丢的012---Listen, honey, it's not Phoebe's fault.
她把你的耳环借我  是我弄丢的  我真的很抱歉012---She lent me the earrings. I lost it. I'm so sorry, honey.
我也觉得好愧疚012---I feel terrible too.
所以我才不借给你东西012---That is exactly why I do not lend you stuff!
先是我的首饰  不是首饰  就是我的蓝色毛衣012---Okay?! I mean, first it's my jewelry! And if it's not my jewelry, it's-it's my blue sweater!
不是蓝色毛衣  就是我的太阳眼镜012---And if it's not my sweater, it's my sunglasses.
你的太阳眼镜  对012---Your sunglasses? Yes.
对啊012---Oh, right.

等等012---Okay, hold on.
我准备好了012---Okay.
你犯不着这样012---Honey, you have nothing to prove.
如果你真的喜欢这个女孩  我也不觉得打情骂俏是好方法012---If you really like this girl, I don't think flirting is the right way
等着看就知道  好吧012---You'll see.Okay.

你们做彼萨  是用烧木头的炉子吗012---Do you make the pizzas in one of those, uh, wood-burning ovens?
不是  其实是瓦斯炉012---No, actually, I think they're gas.
瓦斯炉012---Gas? Wow, ha, ha.

如果连盖勒家的人都这样打情骂俏的话012---If this is the way all the Gellers flirt,
我们就没有问题了012---we don't have a problem.
嘿  你知道瓦斯的味道吗012---Hey, uh You know that smell gas has?
知道012---Yeah.
那是加进去的  什么012---They put that in. What?
瓦斯其实是无色无味012---The gas is odorless.
加上味道  是为了让人在瓦斯漏气时能闻得出来012---But they add the smell so you know when there's a leak.
好吧012---Well, okay.
很多气体都有味道012---A lot of other gas smells.
