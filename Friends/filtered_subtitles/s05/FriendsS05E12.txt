脱衣舞教堂012---Strip church.
我要去找支球拍  你不是有支012---Anyway, I'm gonna go try to find a racket. I thought you had one.

你好吗012---How are you?
有什么新变化012---What is new with you?
变化不多  工作很顺利012---Not much. Um, work's good.
我们不必聊工作嘛  什么都可以聊012---We don't have to talk about work. We could talk about anything.
好吧012---Okay. Um...
这样吧012---Hey! You know what?
我们来聊感情012---Let's talk about relationships.
好  你最近怎样  没人追012---Okay. What's going on with you? Nothing.
该你了012---You go.
我原本觉得银行有一个人很帅012---Well, I... There was this guy at the bank that I thought was cute.
现在不觉得了012---Um, but I don't anymore.
真精彩012---Wow, that's, uh, juicy. Ahem, um...
不过  我确实很忙012---You know what? I actually do have a lot of work to do.
你确定没别的了012---You're sure there's just not anything else?
确定啊  你有什么事想说吗012---Yes, I'm sure. Is there something you want to talk to me about?
没有012---No.
我012---I...
有也不告诉你012---If there was, I wouldn't tell you.
好  然后呢012---Okay, then what happened?

糟糕  怎么了012---No, no, no! What?
我熬了一整晚写信骂艾蜜莉012---Ugh, I was up all night writing this really nasty letter to Emily.

谢了012---Actually, thanks!
可以去看电影了吗012---All right! Everybody ready to go to the movies?
我想我不去了012---Uh, actually, I think I'm gonna skip it.
你不去  对  我要留下来看书012---Really? I'm gonna stay and read my book.
我现在只想静一静012---I just want to be alone right now.
你真的不去012---Oh. Sure you don't want to come?
汤姆汉克斯  梅格莱恩  写信什么的012---Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan. They get mail and stuff.

宾012---Bing!
赢了012---Game!
说真的  你的搭档真是快狠准012---Yeah, I gotta tell you, that partner of yours is a real tiger.
你还好吗012---Are you all right?
我们喝口水012---We'll just get a little sip of water.
我今天很猛吧012---Am I on fire today or what?
那两只肉鸡已经烤好了  等着被切来吃了012---Those birds are browned, basted and ready to be carved.
别激动  网球名将012---Okay, easy, Martina.
我觉得下一场应该让他们赢012---I think we should let them win the next game.
对不起  你刚说的话我听不懂012---I'm sorry, I don't understand what you just said.
让他们赢一场012---Let them win one.
你疯了吗  他们任我们宰割  你看他们012---Are you crazy? We own those two. Look at them!
他喘不过气来  她在吃药012---He can't even breathe, and she's popping pills.
你根本不给他们机会012---You're not giving them a chance.
他们有球拍  不是吗012---They have rackets, don't they?
宾  我想打完这场就收了012---Uh, Bing, I think we're gonna make this the last game.
了解  我求之不得012---Yes, sir. Put me out of my misery.
你真的没打过职业012---Are you sure you never played pro? Ha-ha-ha.
拜托让他们赢012---Please let them win.
我顶多只能把战斗力降到95%012---I'll take it down to 95 percent, but that's the best I can do.
糟糕  漏掉了  我来012---Oopsie! Missed it! I got it!
好球012---Nice shot.
我来012---I got it!
出界012---Long!
你居然让他们赢012---I can't believe you let them win.
至少你把不爽掩饰得很好012---Yeah, well, at least you hid your feelings well about it.
我很沮丧  这是我的球拍012---I was frustrated. It was my racket.
是你让我沮丧012---I was frustrated with you!
如果没输那场球  他们也不会找我们去吃饭012---If we hadn't lost, they would never have invited us to dinner tomorrow.
我最困扰的是012---What bothers me...
你在他们身边整个人都变了012---...is how different you act around them.
故意输球  工作笑012---The throwing the tennis games, the fake laugh...
"回头见  宾"  "不回头就不见"012---...the "See you later, Bing!" "Not if I see you first, Doug!"
我告诉你  我不喜欢"工作的钱德"  那家伙是个狗腿012---I gotta tell you, I don't like "work Chandler." The guy's a suck-up.
因为你这些话012---You know what? Because you said that...
我晚上不跟你玩了012---...I'm not putting out tonight!
绝对有问题  我哥从来不彻夜不归012---I'm telling you,Something's wrong. My brother does not stay out all night.
也许应该去看看垃圾槽012---Maybe we should check the trash chute.
罗斯挤不进垃圾槽012---Ross couldn't fit down the trash chute.
没错  就差那么一点点012---That's right. He almost could.
所以我之前卡住过012---Which is exactly how I got stuck there.
天哪012---Oh, my God!
你死哪去了012---Where the hell have you been?
就是去外面了012---Just, you know, out.
外面  天哪  我们怎么没去那里找012---Oh, out! God, I don't know why we didn't think to check there.
你都在做什么012---What were you doing?
我先去喝酒  然后012---I, uh, went to a bar and then...
就晃了一下012---...I just, uh, walked around for a while.
你整夜一个人在外面乱晃012---You walked around all night in the city by yourself?
他嘿咻了012---He hooked up!
他跟某人嘿咻了012---He hooked up with someone.
我不必回答你们的问题  我是个大人012---I don't have to answer your questions. Okay? I'm a big boy.
爱怎样就怎样012---I can do whatever I want.
他嘿咻了012---He hooked up!
聊聊她嘛012---Tell us about her!
罗斯  你把围巾掉在012---Ross, you left your scarf...
你们好012---Hey, you guys.
好012---Okay. Okay.
好  我知道你们在想什么  但钱德在也门012---I know what you all are thinking, but Chandler is in Yemen.
我还年轻  我有需求  我不能等一辈子012---I'm a young woman. I have needs. I can't wait forever.
我也是这么想的012---Yeah, no, that's what I was thinking.
所以我求求你们  在批评我之前先想一下012---So I'm asking you, please just take a moment before you judge me.
没有人在批评你012---Oh, nobody's judging you.
喔012---Oh.
好  你  天时地利人和先生012---Okay, you, Mr. Right-place-at-the-right-time...

我知道你们要说什么012---Okay, look, I know what you guys are going to say.
你们的孩子会毛茸茸的012---You two would have very hairy children.
我不知道你会说那个012---I didn't know you'd say that.
罗斯  珍妮丝012---Ross! Janice?
等一下  等一下012---All right. Hold on, hold on, hold on.
这是罗斯012---This is Ross. Okay?
他是我们的朋友  他显然是疯了012---He's our friend. He obviously went crazy.
脑筋秀逗了012---He obviously lost his mind.
没那么夸张  好吗  珍妮丝和我有很多共同点012---I didn't lose my mind, okay? Janice and I have a lot in common.
我们都离过婚  我们都有小孩012---We've both been divorced. We both have kids.
你真的要再见她012---Are you actually going to see her again?
别影响他  我确实要再见她012---Don't put ideas in his head! I am gonna see her again.
你看啦  菲比012---Damn it, Phoebe!
我要说出一件我没坦承过的事012---Okay, I have to tell you something that I have never admitted during our entire friendship
高中时我知道你喜欢詹姆法洛  但我还是跟他上了床012---But, when we were in high school I made out with James Farrell even when I knew that you liked him!
哇  说出来的感觉真好  好  该你了012---Wow! That feels so good to get off my chest. Okay, you go.
该我了  什么意思012---My turn? What are you talking about? Ugh.
摩妮卡012---Monica...
我知道你和钱德的事012---I know about you and Chandler.
什么012---What?
我那天听到你们在讲电话012---I overheard you on the phone the other day.
你说 "我会告诉瑞秋  我要花两个小时洗衣服"012---You said, "I'll tell Rachel I'm doing laundry for a couple of hours."
他说 "洗衣服  那是我的新绰号吗"012---And he said, "Laundry? Is that my new nickname?"
然后你说 "不是012---And you said, "No.
你明知你的绰号是大鹏"012---You know what your nickname is, Mr. Big."
这个嘛012---Well, heh...
原来你正在写剧本012---Sounds like you're writing yourself a little play there, Rach.
记得把结局告诉我012---Wow, I... Let me know how that one turns out.
我不知道  因为我吓到了  把电话挂掉了012---I wouldn't know because I got so freaked out I hung up the phone.
如果你听完012---Well, if you had kept listening, ha-ha-ha...
你会听到  我是叫他大012---...you would have heard me call him Mister Big...
碉堡  什么012---...ot. What?
大碉堡012---Mr. Bigot.
他喜欢讲碉堡的笑话012---Ha, ha. He tells the most racist jokes.
好  所以就这样012---All right. So that's it.
你是说你和钱德之间没什么012---You're telling me there's nothing going on between you and Chandler?

你们好  嗯012---Hey, guys. Yeah.
说也奇怪  我今天跟珍妮丝过得很开心012---It's so weird to say this, but I just had a great date with Janice.
什么  真的假的012---What? Are you serious?
没错  我跟她诉说近来的惨事012---Yeah. I opened up to her about all the terrible stuff that's been happening to me.
我说了好几个小时012---I mean, I talked for hours.
有人专心012---It is amazing...
听你倾诉的感觉真好012---...to have someone give you such focused attention.
那你何必找她  你有我们012---You don't need Janice for that. You've got us.
鸭子找到花生酱饼干了  不012---And the duck gets the Nutter Butter! No! Agh!

你们的咖啡要怎么上012---So how do you like your coffee?
我不要  谢谢  我要点点糖012---None for me. Just a little bit of sugar.
那就让摩妮卡把指头伸进去012---Well, maybe I'll bring it out and have Monica stick her finger in it.
应该就会甜了012---That ought to sweeten it up.
你那样笑怎么不会头痛  久了就习惯了012---How does that laugh not give you a headache? You get used to it.
我不觉得我会习惯012---I don't think that I can.
我以后就不甩这套了012---So if you don't mind, maybe this will be it for me on the work things.
老板说笑我就笑  这又有什么呢012---So I laugh at my boss's jokes. What's the big deal?
如果能跟我尊敬的男友在一起012---I'd rather hang out with a sniveling work weasel guy
我干嘛陪一个没尊严的马屁精012---...when I could be hanging out  with my boyfriend, who I actually respect.
嗯012---Oh.
我得为卡拉煮的咖啡道歉012---Ah, heh.I gotta apologize for Kara's coffee.
如果它去打架012---I'd feel sorry for it if it got in a fight.
连自己都保护不了012---It's not strong enough to defend itself. Ha-ha-ha!
你听到我的话了吗012---Did you hear what I said Bing?
什么012---What?
那个笑话啊  你是怎么了012---It's a joke, Bing. What's the matter with you?
我只是觉得不好笑012---Well, I just didn't think it was funny, sir.
你说什么012---Excuse me?
我只是  亲爱的012---Well, I just... Honey?
我觉得你没听懂012---I just don't think you understood the joke.
是吗  是啊012---Really? Yeah.
很好笑嘛  你一定是没听懂012---I mean, it was really funny. I just don't think that you got it.
卡拉煮的咖啡很稀012---Heh, you see, Kara's coffee is weak-tasting.
但道格是在暗示它很虚弱012---But what Doug did was imply that it was weak physically.
现在你懂了吗  我懂了012---You get it now, honey? I think I do!
谢谢你  莫尼卡  我觉得你需要解释012---Thank you, Monica. I thought you could use the help.

钱德和摩妮卡在一起  我很难专心012---Chandler and Monica are over there. It's kind of hard to concentrate.
什么  她刚打来说她要加班012---What? She just called and said she was going to be working late.
她一直骗我012---She keeps lying to me.
够了  我现在就过去  揭穿他们012---That's it! I'm gonna go over there and I'm confronting them right now.
所以我得讲碉堡的笑话012---So you're telling me that I have to tell racist jokes now?
对不起  我不太会圆谎012---I'm just not very good at this.
我很不会骗人  我又很讨厌骗瑞秋012---I'm a terrible liar. I hate having to lie to Rachel.
但我们还不能公开  我知道012---But we're not ready to tell yet. I know.
只是从高中起  我什么事都告诉瑞秋012---Ever since high school, Rachel was the one person that I told everything to.
我好怀念那种感觉012---I miss that so much now.
她是我最要好的朋友012---She's my best friend.

我在钱德的房间里是因为012---Well, what I was doing in Chandler's room is that, um...
我在帮忙打扫012---...I was cleaning it.
实际上  是他付钱请我打扫  是喔012---In fact, he pays me to clean it. Oh!
真是个赚零用钱的好办法012---What a great way to make some extra pocket money.
之前我说要加班012---When I said to you earlier that I was at work, um...
就是指我的这个新工作012---...I'm at my new work.
真不错  对吧012---Good enough. Right?
好  那012---Okay, well, um...
我要去看书了012---I'm gonna go look at my books.

我说过我为什么休长假吧012---I told you I'm on sabbatical from work...
对  你说过012---Yes, yes. You did. Ha-ha-ha.
真是的  又怎么了012---Oh, man! What is wrong now?
我不是点这个012---This isn't what I ordered.
我的人生就不能顺利一点吗012---Man! Can't anything go right in my life?
先是我的婚姻破裂  然后012---First, my marriage falls apart, and then...
我知道  我知道012---I know, I know!
然后你被赶出你家  工作没了012---You lose your apartment, then you lose your job...
你的前妻很快就再婚了  现在咖啡又错了012---...then your ex-wife gets married so fast! And now the coffee!
