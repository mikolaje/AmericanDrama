喔  内裤012---Oh, ew, undies! Oh.
老实说  谁的012---All right, whose are they?
谁的012---Whose are they?
不是我的012---Not mine.
是乔伊的   一定是他的012---Joey's. Got to be Joey's.
的确是我的012---They're mine.
看吧  就是乔伊的  乔...伊的012---See, Joey's. They're Joe-Joe-Joey's.
怎么会在这里012---Why are they here?
我不知道...012---I don't know, uh...
因为我是乔伊012---I'm Joey.
我生性龌龊  随便在别人家脱内裤012---I'm disgusting.I take my underwear off in other people's homes.
快拿走  你有病啊012---Get them out of here. What's wrong with you?
对啊  好恶心012---Yeah. Yeah.
拿去啊  好...012---Take them! I got them.
乔伊  你干嘛不敢碰  这是你自己的内裤012---Joey, You can touch them. They're your underwear.
钱德  借步说话  好012---Chandler? A word? Yeah.
我受够了  不想再帮你们说谎了012---That's it! I'm tired of covering for you two. .
这种鸟事不能再发生了012---This has got to stop. Aah
而且还是白色紧身三角裤012---Ahh! And tighty-whiteys!
你8岁吗012---What are you, 8?
谢谢你  乔伊  感激不尽012---Thank you, Joey, so much.
我一点都不情愿012---You're not welcome, okay?
我讨厌这样012---Look, I hate this.
你们总是害我出丑012---You guys keep embarrassing me.
昨天瑞秋在这的浴室  看到你的剃毛刀012---Yesterday, Rachel found your razor in our bathroom.
我不知道怎么回答012---and I didn't know what to say,
只好说是我的012---so I said it was mine
还说我要在话剧里演女人012---and-and that I was playing a woman in a play.
结果还得一不做二不休012---Then one thing led to another and...
哇  连脚踝周围都剃光了  那里很不好刮啊012---And around the ankles, that is a tough spot.
没错  告诉你们  我不能...012---Yeah, It was. All right, listen...
要说谎我们也不好受012---All this lying has been hard on us too.
是啊  不过至少你们有上床012---Yeah, I bet all the sex makes it easier.
那倒是012---Yeah, actually.
我们下次一定会更小心012---We'll be more careful.
因为我们实在太顺利了  所以还不想让别人知道012---we don't want everyone to know because this is going really well
搞不好就是保密才能这么顺利012---and maybe the reason it's going really well is because it's a secret..
我知道你觉得很怪  但我们都不太会处理感情问题012---I know it sounds really weird, but we're so bad at relationships.
没错  帮帮忙  拜托012---We are. Help us. Help.
好吧  不过...012---All right. But,
你要跟我上一次床012---you do it with me once.

我唯一美好的事物  竟然给人偷吃掉012---Someone ate the only good thing going on in my life!
我还有材料可以再做一个012---I have enough stuff for one more sandwich,
我本来自己要吃...012---I was going to eat it myself, but...
太好了  真是谢谢你012---Mon, that would be incredible. Thank you so much.
我到现在还不相信有人偷吃了012---I still can't believe someone ate it!
我还留了一张纸条在上面012---Look, I left a note and everything.
喂  谁啊012---"Knock-knock." "Who's there?"

你没被扁  就该偷笑了012---I'm surprised you didn't go home wearing your lunch.
不想让别人偷吃你的东西012---Okay, look you wanna hold onto your food?
那就得吓吓他们  这是我在街头流浪学到的012---You gotta scare people off. I learned that living on the street.
真的  你会怎么说  菲比012---Really? So what would you say Pheebs?
比如 "脏手少碰我的馊水"012---Stuff like, uh, "Keep your mitts off my grub."
罗斯  你以为菲比当年是在演《安妮》吗012---Say Ross, when you picture Phoebe living on the street, is she surrounded by the entire cast of Annie?
贴上这张纸条就没人敢偷吃了012---Okay, This'll keep them away from your stuff.
哇...012---Whoa! Ohh!!
菲比  你真狠012---Phoebe, you are a badass!
下次再告诉你们  我拿刀捅条子的事012---Someday I'll, tell you about the time I stabbed the cop.

好吧012---Ahem. Okay.
菲比  这本书说什么012---So Pheebs, what is the book about?
你说你高中念过012---Didn't you read it in high school?

我又是啦啦队的队长012---I was on top of the pyramid .
就是这样啦  到底在说什么012---but anyway.umm, what is this book about?
这是凯西跟希克里夫的悲惨爱情故事012---Okay, umm, It's a tragic love story between Cathy and Heathcliff.
故事发生在英国一座恐怖的山庄012---and umm, It takes place on these creepy moors in England.
场景就代表  男主角性格中狂野的一面012---Which I think represent the wildness of Heathcliff's character.
我对象征主义很有一套012---I totally get symbolism.
这本书的主题是什么012---How would you characterize the theme of this book?
看看找谁  瑞秋葛林012---Uh, let's see... Rachel Green?
这是个爱情悲剧012---Umm, well I would have to say that it's a tragic love story.
非常明显  不过你说得也没错012---That's sort of a given...but, yes.
还有谁有意见012---Anyone else?
还有象征性的意义012---Oh, oh, oh. Symbolism!
狂野的场景...012---And uh, the-the uh, wildness of the mores...
我觉得反映出  男主角性格中桀骜的一面012---which I think is mirrored in the wildness of  Heathcliff's character.
非常好012---Excellent!
瑞秋读得相当透彻012---What Rachel has shrewdly observed here...

亲爱的  随便看看就知道了012---Honey, that was pretty obvious.
你哪晓得  你根本没看过012---Well how would you know? You didn't read it!
你有意见012---What do you think?
穿蓝衬衫这位同学012---Uh, you in the blue shirt?
我认为这个问题  有很多可能的答案012---I think that, um, yours is a question with many possible answers.
那就麻烦你举出一个012---Would you care to venture one?
你愿意说一个吗012---Would you care to venture one?
你是重复我的话吗012---Are you just repeating what I'm saying?
你是重复我的话吗012---Are you just repeating what I'm saying?
好吧  我们继续012---All right. Let's move on.
好012---Okay, then.
你为什么不直接说你没看过012---Why didn't you say you hadn't read the book?
我不希望他认为我很蠢012---because I didn't want him to think I was stupid.
你看看你多蠢啊012---That was really embarrassing, what happened to you.
菲比  什么012---Phoebe! Phoebe! Yeah?
你那张纸条  真是了不起012---Your note? Amazing!
不但没人敢碰我的三明治012---Not only did no one touch my sandwich...
而且还开始对我敬畏三分012---...but people at work are actually afraid of me.
还有人叫我 "疯子"  "疯子盖勒"012---A guy called me "Mental.""Mental Geller."
我一直梦想有这种超酷的外号012---I've always wanted a cool nickname like that.
以前你最酷的外号  就是 "尿裤子盖勒"012---The best you got in high school was, uh, "Wet Pants Geller."
那是饮水机喷到的012---That was the water fountain, okay?
现在有人愿意帮我写报告012---Anyway...people are writing reports for me...
我爱什么时候交就什么时候交012---...uh, pushing back deadlines to fit my schedule.
原来对人耍狠  就可以呼风唤雨012---I tell you, you get tough with people and you can get anything you want.
崔比亚尼  咖啡拿来012---Hey, Tribbiani! Give me that coffee! Now!
今天真有意思012---This was really fun.
我本来还怀疑你会不会约我012---I've been wondering if you'd ask me out.
你还在怀疑吗012---So you, uh, still wondering?
不  我们刚刚才约过会啊012---No. We just went out.
你真聪明  我喜欢012---You're smart.I like that.
还有蜡烛啊012---Oh, candles!
这是什么  毯子  摄影机  我的天啊012---What is that, a blanket?A video camera? Oh, my God!
不是这样...等等啊012---No, no, no. Wait.
不敢相信你竟然在第一次约会  就想拍下我们上床过程012---I can't believe you thought you'd video tape us having sex on the first date!
你好012---Hi.
乔伊  她刚说的...012---Joey, is what she just said, um...
天啊  你还真打算...012---Oh, my God!You're actually gonna
这是怎么回事012---What is going on here?
而且钱德还在家  你是...你变态吗012---And with Chandler in the next room. What are you, what are you sick?
我是乔伊啊012---I'm Joey.
我本来就很恶心012---I mean, I'm disgusting.
还拍低成本的色情片012---I make low-budget adult films.
你们答应我  要更小心的012---You guys promised to be more careful!
乔伊的好名声都给你们毁了012---I mean, come on! The good Joey name is being dragged through the mud here!
对不起  抱歉012---We're so sorry.
我要把你们的事情说出去012---Well, I'm telling everyone about you!
否则内裤跟摄影机的事  只会让人觉得  我是变态猪啰012---That's the only way to explain the underwear and the video camera that doesn't make me look like a pig!
不-不  等一下  一定有其他方法012---No-no, wait! There's got to be a better explanation.
你可以说你在拍色情片  因为你在...上色情片的课012---You can tell them you had to make an adult film for your...adult film class.
这理由还不错  不行012---Yeah, I like that. But no-no,
瑞秋在你家  发现我内裤的事又怎么说012---how does that explain why Rachel found my underwear at your place?
不知道012---I don't know.
看来你们得出柜承认了012---Well, get ready to come out of the non-gay closet!
拜托你等等  我保证一定会想出理由012---Okay, just wait, please.I promise to come up with something.
再让我们多缓几天012---Just give us a little more time.
好吧  最好让我能保住面子012---All right Hey, but it better make me look really, really good.
还有...摄影机012---Oh, and another thing, the video camera?
了不起012---Nice!
罗斯  可以跟你谈谈吗012---Umm, Ross. May I have a word with you?
当然  唐诺012---Of course, Donald.
有同事抱怨你最近脾气火爆012---We've been getting reports of some very angry behavior on your part.
什么012---What? .
写信威胁大家  拒绝按时交报告012---Threatening letters..refusal to meet deadlines.
还有人叫你是 "疯子"012---Apparently people now call you Mental.
是啊012---Yeah.
我们希望你找精神科医生谈谈012---We want you to speak to a psychiatrist.
不  你不懂  其实是误会012---Oh, no. Uh, you...You don't understand. This is so silly.
一切要从我的三明治说起012---Um, this is all just because of a sandwich.
三明治012---A sandwich?
我妹妹非常会做火鸡三明治012---You see, my sister makes these amazing turkey sandwiches.
她的秘诀就是  多夹一片浸过肉汁的面包在中间012---Her secret is, she puts an extra slice of gravy-soaked bread in the middle.
我称那片为 "多汁秘方"012---I call it "The Moistmaker."
有一次我把三明治放在冰箱012---Anyway, I put my sandwich in the fridge...
你知道吗  什么012---Ha-ha-ha. Oh, you know what?
对不起  应该是我吃掉了012---I'm sorry.I believe I ate that.
你吃了我的三明治012---You ate my sandwich?
我一时看错  谁都可能拿错012---A simple mistake. It can happen to anyone.
是吗012---Oh, really?
难道你的三明治  也有"多汁秘方"012---Did you confuse it with your own turkey sandwich with a Moistmaker?
没有  难道你没看到上面的纸条012---No, I...Do you, perhaps, remember...seeing a note on top of it?
我以为那是有人开玩笑  或是随手写的打油诗012---There may have been a joke or limerick of some kind.
上面清楚写着那是我的三明治012---That said it was...my sandwich!
你别激动012---Now calm down.
可以到我办公室找找  可能垃圾筒里还有剩012---Come look in my office, some of it my still be in the trash.
什么012---What?
那个三明治很大012---Well, it was quite large.
我必须丢掉一大半012---I-I-I-I-I had to throw most of it away.
你...丢掉我的三明治012---You-you-you-you threw my sandwich away?
我的三明治012---My sandwich?
嗨  嗨012---Hi. Hi.
这本书在讲什么012---So umm, What's this book about?
这本你也没看012---You didn't read it, either?
我本来是要看  结果却看了其它的书012---Well, I was going to, but I, uh, accidentally read something else.
什么012---What?
时尚杂志012---Vogue.
跟我说这本《简爱》是在说什么012---Hey, So tell me about Jane Eyre.
不行  你应该自己看012---No, You should've read it yourself!
菲比  别这么假正经嘛012---Come on Phoebe! don't be such a goody-goody.
好吧012---Fine.
简爱呢  你会以为她是女人  其实不然012---Okay, all right. So Jane Eyre? First you'd think she's a woman, but she's not.
她是生化人012---She's a cyborg.
生化人  就是机器人012---A cyborg? Isn't that like a robot?
这本书在当时超级先进012---Yeah, This book was light years ahead of its time.
抱歉迟到  开始上课吧012---Sorry I'm late. Let's get started.
大家对《简爱》有何感想012---So, What did you think of Jane Eyre?
瑞秋刚跟我讨论过  她有些看法非常有趣012---Um, Rachel and I were discussing it, and she actually had very interesting insights.
请说  瑞秋012---Go ahead, Rachel.
谢谢你  菲比012---Um, thank you, Phoebe.
《简爱》最让我震惊的就是012---Umm, well, What struck me most when reading Jane Eyre...
这本书非常惊世骇俗012---...was, uh, how the book was so ahead of its time.
如果你指的是女性主义  这么说也成012---If you're talking about feminism, I think you're right.
当然有写到女性主义  不过还有机器人012---Well, feminism, yes. But also the robots.
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
既然上次拍摄不成功012---Since that video camera thing didn't work out...
我先给你一点预告片段012---...I thought that I would give you just a little preview.
你在照片中没穿衣服012---You're naked in this picture!
我知道012---I know!
罗斯012---Ross?
钱德012---Hey, Chandler.
摩妮卡012---Monica!
罗斯  你没事吧012---Ross, Are you okay?
我很好012---I'm fine.
我今天上班去看过精神医生012---I saw a psychiatrist at work today.
为什么012---Why?
因为我脾气太暴躁012---On account of my rage.
而且最近越来越严重012---Which, if I may say, right now is out of control.
所以他开药丸给我012---He gave me a pill for it.
药丸012---A pill?
医生说我对上司大吼大叫012---Uh-huh. When the psychiatrist told me to take a leave of absence...
所以应该请假012---...because I yelled at my boss,
我又开始暴跳如雷012---I started to get worked up again.
所以他要我吃颗镇定剂012---So he offered me a tranquilizer.
我觉得这主意不错012---And I thought it was a good idea.
所以就吃了012---So I took it.
等等  他们逼你请假012---Wait a minute, They're making you take time off work?
而且你也同意012---And you're okay with that?
我不知道012---I don't know.
刚开始不工作可能不习惯012---It's going to be weird not having a job for a while.
不过我已经不在乎三明治了012---But I definitely don't care about my sandwich.
我丢脸丢大了  你竟然还让我一直说下去012---That's so embarrassing! I can't believe you let me go on like that!
对不起012---I'm sorry.
你把简爱比成机器战警  实在太爆笑了012---It was just so funny when you started comparing Jane Eyre to Robocop.
一点也不好笑012---That was not funny!
我太气了012---I snapped, okay?
你根本不想好好上课012---You weren't taking the class seriously.
菲比  这有什么了不起012---Phoebe, Come on! What is the big deal?
我以为我们就是一起出去012---I thought it'd be something we could do together.
上课打发时间闹着玩012---Y'know, I thought it would be fun.
好玩很重要012---Well, yeah! Fun is good.
但是我也想学点东西012---but y'know I also wanted to learn.
大家老说在高中学东学西  我却没上过高中012---People talk about what they learned in high school. I never went to high school.
所以你真的想学东西012---Ohh. Oh, So you really wanted to learn.
但是  菲比  我只想找点乐子012---Yeah, y'know, Pheebs, I just wanted to have fun.
你知道你该拉谁去吗012---Ohh, you know who you should go with?
我知道...012---I know! I know! I know!
摩妮卡  问题是你提的012---Monica, you asked the question.
天啊  是摩妮卡012---Oh, my God, that's Monica!
不是这样...你别误会012---Oh, no, no, no!
离我远点  你这个大变态012---You get away from me, You sick, sick, sick, sick-o!!
怎么啦012---What's going on?
乔伊有偷窥癖012---Joey has got a secret peephole!
天啊...012---Oh, no, no, no, no!
对  他有摩妮卡的裸体照片012---Yes! He has a naked picture of Monica!
他拍下我们裸体的样子012---He takes naked pictures of us,
还一边吃鸡块一边看012---then he eats chicken and looks at them!
你们看  那是我老妹啊012---Look. Oh! Dude, that's my sister!
给我  等下  大家先别激动012---Give me that! All right, Wait! Everybody just calm down. Okay?
要给我们的老友乔伊  有机会解释他为何如此变态012---Let's give our friend Joey a chance to explain why he's such a big pervert!
我不是变态好吗012---No! I am not a pervert! Okay?
只是...我...其实...012---It's just...I just kind of...
大家听我说  我可以帮他解释012---All right, look! Look. I think I can explain this.
谢谢012---Thank you.
乔伊是性爱狂012---Joey's a sex addict.
什么  才怪012---What? No, I'm not!
没关系  不怪你012---It's okay! It's good! It's good.
这只是一种病012---It's a disease.
胡说  我才不是性爱狂012---No! No! I am not a sex addict!
你明明就是012---Yes, you are!
这才能解释最近这一连串的事012---That's the only way to explain all this stuff!
事实不是这样012---No, it isn't. No, it's not.
你也可以说出真相012---Because you could also explain it with the truth!
什么真相012---What is the truth?
怎么回事  你在说什么012---What's up? What's going on?
我跟摩妮卡上床了012---I slept with Monica.
听听大家怎么说012---Well, let's see what everybody thinks of that.
天啊012---Oh, no.
你跟我老妹上床012---You slept with my sister?
对  只在伦敦发生过一次012---Uh, yes, but it was...We just did it once, uh, in London.
这会让我开始抓狂012---This is not good for my rage.
摩妮卡  是真的吗012---Monica.Is this true?
当然是真的012---Of course, it's true.
否则怎么解释这些怪事012---How else would you explain all the weird stuff that's been going on?
是真的012---Yes, it's true.
如果只发生过一次012---Okay, but if it only happened that one time,
你的内裤  怎么会出现在我们家012---how come we found your underwear in our apartment the other day?
那件内裤是我当天在伦敦穿的  对不对  摩妮卡012---That was the underwear I was wearing that night in London. Right Monica?
我想留下来...当纪念品012---I guess I wanted to keep it...as a souvenir.
天啊  摩妮卡012---My God, Monica!
你确定  乔伊  你确定你不是性爱狂012---Are you sure Joe? Are you sure you're not just a sex addict?
不  要是有人是性爱狂  那也是摩妮卡012---No! If anyone's a sex addict here, it's Monica!
没错  打我们从伦敦回来  她就想再勾引我上床012---Yeah. She has been trying to get me back in the sack ever since London!
所以她才拍裸照给你012---That's why she gave you a naked picture of herself.
这样说得通012---That makes sense.
录影机呢012---And the video camera?
摩妮卡012---Uh, Monica?
我架好录影机是为了引诱乔伊上钩012---I guess I set up the video camera to try and entice Joey.
可惜我不吃这套012---But, sadly, I could not be enticed.
不可思议  你还留下乔伊的内裤012---Unbelievable! You really kept Joey's underwear?
为什么  你为什么这么做012---Why? Why would you do that?
因为我是摩妮卡012---I'm Monica.
生性下流012---I'm disgusting.
我会跟踪男人  留下他们的内裤012---I stalk guys and keep their underpants.
现在终于知道谁是恶心鬼了012---Well, I think we've all learned something about who's disgusting and who's not. Eh?
好了  我要开始吃炸鸡了012---All right. Now, I'm going to get back to my bucket.
我只吃鸡皮  你们可以吃鸡肉012---I'm only eating the skin, so the chicken's up for grabs.
你说得很有道理012---I really thought you making a good point.
可惜后来被打断012---I mean y'know, until you got cut off.
我知道  那个摩妮卡哪里有病啊012---What's up with that girl Monica?
谁晓得  她不是我朋友012---I don't know. I didn't come with her.
好消息  各位  你们猜怎么了012---Hey, everybody! Everybody, guess what!
我说服卡尔下周考试012---I just convinced Carl to give us a test next week!.
考试012---Test?
开心点  有考试才有进步012---Come on! Tests make us all better learners!
对了  应该考申论题012---Oh, yeah! We should have essay questions!
