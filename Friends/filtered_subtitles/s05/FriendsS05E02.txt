刚才载我来的司机012---Okay, I was coming over and this cabdriver...

他的帽子很好笑012---Yeah, so, he had a really funny hat.
我不想说了012---I don't want to talk about it.
嘿  嘿  罗斯012---Hey. Hey, Ross!
伯丁罕012---Boddington's!
是啊012---Oh, man!
要是能再喝一杯  要我走回伦敦都行012---That was good beer. Y'know, I'd walk back to London for another frosty one of those bad boys.
世贸附近的英国酒馆好像有012---Y'know, I think they have those at that British pub near the trade center.
回头见012---Later!
瑞秋不是该回来了吗012---Isn't Rachel supposed to be back by now?
是啊  那趟班机在雅典误点了012---Yeah, but her plane got delayed in Athens.
不过  现在也该到了012---But actually, she should be here by now.
你跟她通过电话  她很生气吗012---Oh, so-so you talked to her. Did she, did she sound mad?
不会  那是因为她喜欢我012---No. But she likes me.
你丢她独自飞到希腊去012---You abandoned her on a plane to Greece.
我才没有 "丢下" 瑞秋012---Okay, I did not "abandon" Rachel. Okay?
艾蜜莉出现在机场012---Emily showed up at the airport.
我当然得去追她  我别无选择012---I had to go after her. I mean, I-I did what I had to do!
她是我的太太  瑞秋是我太太012---She's my wife. Rachel is my wife.
是艾蜜莉012---Y'know—Emily!
艾蜜莉是我老婆012---Emily is my wife.
我这是怎么了012---Man, what is that?
你还没有艾蜜莉的消息012---So you still hadn't heard from Emily?
我在机场追丢之后就没有了012---No, Not since I lost her at the airport.
她竟然跑得比你快012---I can't believe she can out run you man!
她是飞毛腿  好吗012---Hey! She's fast, okay?
你以为你可以打击我   现在就出去单挑012---Oh! You think you can beat me? Let's go! Outside!
嗨012---Hi!
嗨   瑞秋012---Hi! Rachel!
瑞秋  我很抱歉  非常对不起你012---Rach, I am so sorry. I am so, so sorry.
别这样  你迫不得已012---Come on. You just did what you had to do.
嗨  菲比012---Hi, Pheebs.
就这样  你不生气  你一定很难受012---That's it? You're not mad? I mean, It must've been terrible.
难受   我到的可是希腊啊012---Terrible? Hell, I was in Greece!
那儿有豪华的酒店  迷人的沙滩  人又和善012---There was a nice hotel, nice beach, met the nice people.
对我瑞秋来说可不差啊012---It's not too shabby for Rachel.
那  就这样了012---So, what, that's it?
对  我们和好了  我没生你的气012---Well, yeah. We're cool. Totally cool.
谢谢  瑞秋  你是最棒的012---Thanks, Rach. You're the best.
哦  不  你才是最棒的012---Oh, no. You're the best.
我要去花店一趟012---Oh, I got to go to the flower store.
看来  大家都不肯说艾蜜莉在哪里012---Check it out, No one will tell me where Emily is...
所以我决定买72朵长茎红玫瑰  寄到艾蜜莉爸妈家012---...so I'm gonna send 72 long-stemmed, red roses to her parents' house.
每朵代表我认识她   并且深爱她的每一天012---one for each day that I've known and loved her.
她一定会感动的012---That oughta get her talking to me again.
对了  罗斯  写卡片时别忘了  对方是 "艾蜜莉"012---Oh, Ross,When you make out the card, be sure to make it out to "Emily."
瑞秋  太棒了  幸好你在希腊玩得开心012---Rach, that's great! It's so good that you had a good time in Greece!
什么012---What?
我在希腊才不开心012---I didn't have a good time in Greece!
罗斯丢下我一人012---Ross abandoned me!
我买不到机票回来  只好住在他们的蜜月套房012---Okay, I couldn't get a plane out. so I had to stay in their honeymoon suite
每个人都要来问我 "盖勒太太  你哭什么"012---with people coming up to me all the time going, "Oh, Mrs. Geller, why are you crying"
简直丢死人了012---I mean, it was so humiliating!
我就像个白痴012---I felt like such an idiot!
这都是我的错  你们知道为什么吗012---It's all my fault. And you know why,
因为我的决定都不对012---Because I make very bad decisions.
不要这么说012---Oh, that's not true.
就是这样  我没胡说  我跑去愚蠢的伦敦追罗斯012---Yes, it is true. I went,I went after Ross in stupid London!
伦敦的确是个蠢地方  太蠢012---London is stupid! Stupid!
菲比你是对的  我根本不该去伦敦012---Phoebe, you were right. I should've never gone to London.
从今开始   由你帮我做决定012---and from now on, you make all my decisions for me.
不行  我以前就这么做过012---Oh, no. I did that for someone once.
我不喜欢主宰别人的生活012---I'm not comfortable having that kind of power and control over someone's life.
那我来012---I'll do it.
很好  摩妮卡  以后由你主宰我的感情生活012---That's fine. So Monica, you are now in charge of my love life.
好  我该去上班了012---Okay. I got to go to work.
瑞秋  很高兴看到你回来012---And, uh, Rachel, great to have you back.
菲比012---Pheebs!
看到你真开心012---Always a pleasure.
瑞秋  你看012---Rachel? Sweetie, look.
这是你跟乔伊在招待会的照片012---it's a really cute picture of Joey and you at the reception.
他已经结婚了012---Ohh, He's married.
罗斯结婚了  我到现在还不敢相信012---Ross is married. I can't-I still can't believe it.
亲爱的  抓旁边就好012---Honey, sweetie, by the edges.
看来我只好接受事实了012---I mean, y'know I'm just gonna have to accept it
这都要怪我012---I mean, it's my fault.
亲爱的  抓边上  指纹弄脏照片012---Sweetie! Edges! Fingers! Smudgey!
天啊012---Oh, my God!
算了  我知道你心情低落012---Okay. That's okay. I know that you're very upset right now.
不是故意找我麻烦012---I know, I know that wasn't about me.
我看她就是跟她作对012---I bet it was about her a little.
你要是肯放下罗斯一分钟012---If you'd stop thinking about Ross for one minute...
就会发现这里到处有帅哥012---...you'd notice there are great guys everywhere.
你看  阿甘012---you look. Gunther.
他既善良又可爱012---He's nice. He's cute.
阿甘的确...012---Yeah. I guess Gunther is...
还有那边那个家伙012---What about that guy over there?
记得吗  你以前  跟他在柜台打情骂俏过012---Remember? That's the guy you flirted with at the counter that time.
我不知道  我不知道012---Oh, I don't know. I don't know.
你现在就去跟他说话012---You're going to talk to him.
我们说好了  由我发号施今  我决定你去跟他说话012---Y'know what? We made a deal, I make your decisions and I say you're going to talk to him.
好吧012---All right.
你说了算  看来我只好照办012---You're the boss. I guess. I got to do what you tell me.
他听到这句话  肯定上钩012---Say that to him, and you're golden.
嘿  嗨012---Hey. Hey.
菲比  伦敦的照片洗出来了012---Hey, Pheebs. We got our pictures back from London.
这张是所有人在伦敦塔拍的012---Here's all of us at the Tower of London...
大家都在照片中012---Here we all are.
有罗斯  乔伊  你...012---Yeah, There's Ross and Joey and you and...
和我012---And me.
你一定听烦我们说伦敦的事了012---y'know what, we've been talking about London too much haven't we?
是我不好  因为我去不了012---No. I'm sorry. it's just because I couldn't be there.
我只能大着肚子  烦都快烦死了012---'Cause all I ever get to do now is pregnant stuff, it just bums me out.
可怜啊  真抱歉012---I'm sorry. Sorry.
怎么样  总之我们东扯西扯012---What happened? Well, y'know, A little of this, a little of that.
明天晚上要出去约会012---Got myself a date tomorrow night.
看吧  早告诉过你  你能忘了罗斯的012---See? Didn't I tell you? You're getting over Ross already.
滚出去012---Get out.
你怎么去了那么久012---What took you so long?
公事担搁了  不过我明天就辞职012---I got caught up at work. But I'm quitting tomorrow.
谢谢你邀我过来012---So thanks for having me over.
瑞秋012---Rach...
菲比012---Pheebs...
再见012---See you, man.
他发什么神经012---What the hell was that?
可能在伦敦学到的欧洲风俗012---Probably some European goodbye thing he picked up in London.
那才不是欧洲风俗012---That's not European.
比较像法式热吻012---Well, It felt French.
我玩得好开心012---Oh God, I really had a good time.
我也是012---Yeah, me too.
那012---So...
到此为止012---I guess this is it.
是啊012---Yeah, um...
除非你想进来  好012---Unless you want to come inside? Yeah!
等等  我做不了主012---Oh, uh, wait a minute. You know what? I can't decide this.
等我一下012---Okay. Just hold on a second.
嗨012---Um, hi.
嗨012---Hi.
摩妮卡在吗  我有事要问她012---Is Monica around? I have to ask her something.
她去洗衣服012---Doing her laundry.
那是什么012---What's that?
我今天收到的包裹012---It came in the mail today.
72朵长茎红玫瑰012---it's uh, 72 long-stemmed, red roses.
每朵代表我认识她  并且深爱她的每一天012---One for each day that I've known and loved Emily...
却给剪成了碎片012---...cut up into mulch.
真是糟糕012---Oh, honey that's awful.
还好啦012---It's not so bad.
摩妮卡要用它来做香料012---Monica's going to make potpourri.
我要出去淋雨散散心012---I think I'm going to go wander out in the rain for a while.
外面没下雨012---It's not raining.
连老天都不赏脸012---I can't catch a break.
罗斯  你哪也别去  就坐这里012---Y'know what Ross? You're not going anywhere. Sit right here.
我给你泡茶  然后我们聊聊012---I'm gonna make you a cup of tea and we're gonna talk this thing whole out.
好吗012---All right?
好012---Okay.
大卫  怎么样012---Hey, Dave. Yeah.
听着  改天再请你进来  我的室友病得很重012---Umm, listen, I'm gonna need to take a rain check, my roommate is just really sick.
好  再见012---Okay. Bye.
亲爱的  听着012---Honey, listen.
我知道事情感觉很糟012---I know things seem so bad right now..
看起来不会好012---...and that they won't get any...
我可以跟你谈谈吗012---Can I talk to for just a minute?
我掉了几只袜子012---I dropped some socks.
好的012---Yeah.
你想惹麻烦吗  你又想老调重弹  又想跳回去自找苦吃012---What is the matter with you? Do you want to fall into the trap? Do you want to fall into the trap?!
你根本没掉袜子012---You did not drop any socks!
我刚碰到大卫  他说你打发他走012---I just ran into Dave, and he told me that you blew him off!
你给我听好012---I mean, You listen to me!
我要发号施令了  我要你离开罗斯去追大卫012---Now, I'm calling the shots! I say you leave Ross and go get Dave.
你到底想怎么样012---What the hell were you trying to do?
其实我想  我打算012---Well, ultimately I was trying, you know, I wanted...
告诉他我还爱他012---...tell him y'know, that I'm still in love with him..
什么  你不准说012---What? You cannot tell him that!
为什么  为什么不准012---Why? Why not?
大家都喜欢听到这种话012---People love to hear that!
这里由我做决定  我不准你说012---I make the decisions and I say no!
你知道吗  你不能帮我做决定   因为...012---Well, You know what? No, you don't make my decisions, because...
我要开除你012---...you're fired.
你不能开除我012---You can't fire me.
你的事情由我来决定  我说 "我没被开除"012---I make your decisions, and I say, "I'm not fired!" Ha!
既然如此012---Well...
瑞秋  让我进去012---Rachel! Come on, let me in!
怎么了012---Having some trouble?
瑞秋把我锁在门外012---Rachel locked the door.
你肯亲我  我就帮你撞开012---I'll kick that door in if you give me some sugar.
瑞秋  让我进去012---Rachel! Let me in!
谢谢012---Thank you.
瑞秋  我可以去外面跟你谈谈吗012---Rachel? Can I talk to you outside for a sec?
不可以012---No.
我真的有话要跟你说012---We really need to talk to you.
那就说啊012---Well, then talk.
那我就说了012---Okay, I will.
记得我们刚说你要做的事吗012---Remember that thing we just discussed that you wanted to do?
记得012---Yes.
什么事012---What thing?
瑞秋要去学摇摆舞012---Rachel wants to take swing dance lessons.
我非常不赞成012---Which I think is a really stupid idea.
因为这种舞很危险  她一定学不会012---It's dangerous. she's never gonna get what she wants.
而且搞不好还会撞伤人012---And who knows who she might end up hurting?
摩妮卡说得对  摇摆舞有点危险012---Monica's right. Swing dancing can be tricky.
我要打电话012---I have to use the phone.
我要取消五只  送给艾蜜莉的熊宝宝012---I got to cancel those five, giant teddy bears I sent to Emily.
否则熊宝宝难逃死劫012---My God. Think of the massacre.
我就是要说012---I'm going to do it.
瑞秋  我知道你认为我疯了012---Rachel, I know-I know you think I'm crazy.
但是在你告诉他之前  至少找到一个...012---But before you tell him you love him, just-just try to find one person...
同意你想法的人  我打赌你找不到  但是012---...who thinks it's a good idea. I bet you can't. But I…
拜托012---Please?
好吧012---All right. Fine.
乔伊  我已经进来了012---Joey! I'm in!
那好012---All right. Good deal.
菲比  嘿012---Pheebs! Hey! Pheebs!
菲比  怎样012---Uh, okay, Pheebs? Yeah?
你上次说你都不能去伦敦012---Um, y'know how the other day you were talking about how you didn't get to go to London ...
觉得自己遭到大家遗弃  如何012---...and you were feeling left out? Yeah.
我们对这事很愧疚012---Well, we all felt really bad about that so...
决定大家一起去旅行012---...we decided to take a little trip together.
太好了012---Oh, that's so nice!
太棒了  要去哪里012---How great! where? Where's the trip?
我们可以一起去野餐012---Well, we thought we would all go to a picnic...
就去中央公园   中央公园012---...in Central Park! Central Park?
对  大家一起去  一整天012---Yeah, All of us. All day.
什么鸟地方012---That sucks!
那根本不算旅行  我才刚从公园过来012---That's not a trip! I just came from the park!
大家去中央公园有什么好兴奋012---What are we gonna high five about at the stupid Central Park?
好啊  就在我家旁边012---It's right by my house. All right!
我决定回家反省这个烂主意012---I'm going home to bask in the triumph of my Central Park idea.
等一下  热吻先生012---Hold on a sec there, Mr. Kissy.
我一直想跟你讨论012---Y'know, I've been meaning to talk to you about...
你新学的欧洲民情012---...this whole, little, new European thing you've got going on.
你搞得我非常不自在012---and I just need to tell you that it makes me very uncomfortable...
拜托  你别再亲了012---...and I just, you know, just stop it!
我只是想  介绍大家认识欧洲文化012---I was just trying to bring a little culture to the group.
只要不要介绍到我嘴里就好了012---That's fine. Just don't bring it in my mouth.
我都快吐了012---Makes me wanna puke!
各位  菲比来了012---Hey, everybody! Pheebs is here!
菲比  大家好012---Phoebe! Whoo! Okay. Whoo! Hi!
菲比  我们认为野餐的主意012---Okay, Pheebs, we decided that the picnic idea was a little...
实在是没什么意思  不去了012---It didn't have any... Well, it blew.
所以今天下午决定  到大西洋城012---So, we thought that this afternoon we'd all go away for the whole weekend...
去度周末012---...to Atlantic City.
大西洋城  太好了  谁想到的012---Ooh, Atlantic City! Oh, that's a great plan! Whose plan was that?
我的012---Mine!
等等   是我提议的  错012---Wait. It was my plan. No...
我说我们应该想个新的计划012---...I said we needed a new plan.
然后我想到要去大西洋城012---And I came up with Atlantic City.
这就是新的计划啊012---Which is the new plan.
大家一小时后楼上见012---Okay, well, why don't we all meet upstairs in an hour?
好012---Okay.
我要去打包了  我要摇着大屁股好好打包012---I'm going to go pack. I'm going to go pack my ass off.
瑞秋  我们走吧012---Come on Rach, let's go.
我等一下再上去找你012---Yeah, y'know what? I'm-I'm gonna meet you upstairs in a minute.
不行  瑞秋  没有人支持你  所以你不能说012---No! Rachel, you didn't find anyone, so you can't tell him.
无所谓012---Well, You know what? That doesn't matter.
你知道对方不能回应你的爱意012---Okay, Rachel, do you have any idea how painful it is to tell someone you love them...
会有多痛苦吗012---...and not have them say it back?
我不在乎012---I don't care.
好吧012---Okay...
可是我看不下去012---I can't watch.
你在看什么012---What you reading?
报纸012---Paper.
上面说了什么012---Yeah? What's it about?
世界各地的新闻012---The events from around the globe.
是啊012---Okay...
我有件事要告诉你012---Uhh, Ross, there's something that I-that I have to talk to you about
虽然大家都叫我别说012---and everybody's saying that I shouldn't tell you,
但是他们都错了  有时候别人就是看不清楚012---But I think they're wrong. I mean, and you know how people can be wrong.
有一次上班时012---Sure. Once at work...
我说放射性碳测定法太老旧012---...I thought carbon dating is fossilized...
我真的有话跟你说012---I'm really trying to tell you something here.
说吧012---Go ahead.
我这就说了012---Umm, okay, I think I'm-I'm just gonna-just gonna say it.
现在就告诉你012---Just gonna say it. Uhh,
我还爱着你  罗斯012---I'm still in love with you, Ross.
嗯  我012---Huh. I'm...
我不知道现在该怎么回答012---Wow. Umm...Huh...I'm-I'm not sure what to do with that right now.
怎么了  你跟我开玩笑  这就太恶劣了012---What? Was that a joke? Because it's mean.
我很正经012---I'm so dead serious.
不能再正经了012---I'm totally serious.
那你笑什么012---Why are you laughing?
因为我刚听到自己的话012---Because I just heard it!
我听到了  而且觉得很荒谬012---I heard it! And it's ridiculous!
毕竟...012---I mean...
你已经结婚012---You're married!
你已经结婚  我说这话太可笑012---You're married, and it's just ridiculous.
我说话时似乎灵魂出壳012---and it's like, When I said it, I sort of floated up out of my body.
我的灵魂听到肉身说话012---y'know? And then I heard myself say it, and then the floating Rachel...
灵魂认为  自己实在很白痴012---I was like, "You are such an idiot!"
我的确已经结婚   我知道012---Well, I am married. I know.
虽然婚礼后就没跟老婆说过话012---Even though I haven't spoken to my wife since the wedding.
抱歉  这不好笑012---I'm sorry. That's not funny.
其实  还蛮好笑的012---Actually, it kind of is.
我老婆不回我电话012---My wife won't return my calls.
