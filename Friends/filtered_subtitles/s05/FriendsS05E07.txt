嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
艾蜜莉的表妹  竟然把我赶出来012---Emily's cousin kicked me out.
什么  为什么012---What? Why?
当你跟老婆的表妹分租公寓012---when you're subletting an apartment from your wife's cousin
要是之后又离婚012---and then you get a divorce
表妹就会突然把房子要回去012---sometimes the cousin suddenly wants his apartment back.
怎么可以这样  你们没签约吗012---How can he do that?Didn't you sign a lease?
谁跟亲戚租公寓还签约012---Who needs a lease when it's "family"?
嘿  你可以跟我们住012---Hey, You can stay with us.
我们照顾你  没错012---We'll take care of ya! Oh, yeah! Absolutely!

哇  摩妮卡  要是每家餐厅  都跟你的一样干净012---Wow, Monica. if every restaurant is as clean as yours,
我就没饭吃了012---I'd have a tough time making a living.
别说了  赖瑞012---Ha, oh, Larry!
卫生稽查员收佣金吗012---Um, do health inspectors work on commission?
不  不过收红包012---No, bribes.
我可以笑吧012---Ha-ha-ha, it's okay to laugh?
当然  我开玩笑的啦012---I was just kidding.
我去检查厨房地板012---I'll check the kitchen floor.
请自便  赖瑞012---Knock yourself out.
真可口012---Yummy! Heh.
你说赖瑞   我也愿意让他检查我厨房地板012---Larry? Yeah, I'd let him check out my kitchen floor.
98分012---A 98.
你没戴帽子  所以扣两分012---I deducted 2 points because you are not wearing your chef's hat,
因为违反第五条规定012---That is a Section 5 violation.
听着  赖瑞  亲爱的012---Oh. Now look, Larry, honey, ha, ha.
我写过第五条条文的书012---Um, I wrote the book on Section 5.
在厨房才要戴帽子012---I know that you don't have to wear your hat unless you're in the kitchen.
那你的帽子呢  在厨房  我进去拿012---Where's your hat? In the kitchen. I'll get it.
就这里扣两分012---Ah, there's the two points!
你真该读读你自己写的书012---You should really read that book you wrote.
哇  你看到帽子在厨房012---You saw the hat in the kitchen
知道她进去拿时没戴帽子012---and knew that she'd have to go in there hatless to get it.
你可以主演  卫生稽查员兼侦探的电视剧了012---You could have your own health inspector detective show.
你太客气了012---Ah, I don't know about that.
而我可以演你的助手薇达012---But then I could be your sidekick, Voonda, heh.
或许薇达可以留电话给我  我就能约她出去吃饭012---Maybe uh, Vunda could give me her number and I can ask her to dinner sometime.
好  她一定会很高兴012---She would love that...Y'know
因为你知道哪家餐厅才卫生012---...since you know all the clean places to eat, heh.
我再打给你012---I'll call you.
他真幽默012---He's so funny! Whoa, oh.
谢了 谢谢012---Thank you. Thanks.
摩妮卡  罗斯还好吧  还在为艾蜜莉伤心吗012---How's Ross doing since all the Emily stuff?
心情不太好012---He's not great. .
不过还撑得下去012---But, um, he's dealing with it
等等  你该不会  拜托  不可能012---Oh. Wait, you're not...
我不可能再跟罗斯交往012---Oh, I can't get started with all that Ross stuff again
他还要失魂落魄很久的时间012---I mean, he's gonna screwed up for a looong time.
况且你也知道  我不喜欢追离婚的男人012---Besides, I don't go for guys right after they get divorced.
对  快结婚的人你才要012---Right, you only go for them five minutes before they get married.
我要两磅爪哇摩卡咖啡012---Two pounds of mocha java.
是丹尼  你们还会出去吗012---It's Danny. Are you guys ever gonna go out again?
不知道012---I don't know.
上次出去一次之后  他就没再打给我012---He hasn't called me since that one time when we went out.
我们只在走廊上打情骂俏012---I see him in the hallway. We flirt.
我笑得下巴掉下来  结果却没下文012---I'm all...and then nothing.
嘿  嗨  丹尼012---Hey. Hi, Danny.
你很渴吧012---Wow, thirsty, huh?
我周六要办派对  庆祝我搬新家012---ctually, actually, I'm having a party at my place on Saturday, it's sort of a house warming kind of thing.
真有意思  真好012---Oh, fun. Oh, great!
我非常期待  是啊012---I'm really looking forward to it. Yeah.
那我走了012---Okay, See you!
看来他新家不欢迎我们012---Well, I guess we won't be warming his house.
很好  我知道他在玩什么把戏012---Okay. All right, I see what he's doing!
他故意不约我  因为他要我主动约他012---He's not asking me out because he wants me to ask him out.
可是你不鸟他  没错012---And you won't do that. That's right!
否则主导权就落在他手里012---Cause that would give him the control.
他现在故意说什么要办派对012---So now he's all ooh, coming up with this whole I've got a party thing y'know.
要我暗示他约我012---trying to get me to hint around for an invitation.
可是我当场给他好看  对吧012---Blew up in his face, didn't it? Ha.
所以他根本没有要办派对012---So there is no party?
有  当然有  当然有012---No, there's a party. There's a party.
不过谁是老大还不知道呢012---But the power?that is still up for grabs.
你听得懂吗012---You follow me?
应该吧012---I think so.
你是说他故意不约你  是因为他喜欢你012---So he's not inviting you to his party because he likes you?
就是这样012---Exactly!
罗斯012---Ross?
嘿  室友们012---Hey, roomies!
你把家里布置得真温馨012---I love what you've done with the place.

真是闪闪发亮012---Shiny, ha, ha.
我可以去洗个手吗  因为我下班就直接过来了012---Oh, you mind if I wash up? Because I came straight from work .
谁晓得这两个宝贝碰过什么呢012---and who knows where these babies have been
你真是耍宝的要命啊  哈啊012---You are just nonstop, ha-ha-ha!
我们必须立刻离开这里  为什么012---We're out of here. Why?
我刚经过厨房就看到了有十项违规了012---Just walking past the kitchen I saw 10 violations!
我要勒令他们停业012---I'm shutting this place down!
你有权限可以这样做吗012---You have the power to do that?.
有这个就可以012---This does
那就让他们停业吧012---Shut it down.
嘿012---Hey.

你造了一座城堡   对吧012---You built a fort, didn't you?
差不多012---Kind of, heh.
天啊  空气清净器  是罗斯的空气清净器012---Oh, my God! The air purifier. Ross' air purifier.
我大学四年只听得到…012---All I heard for four years through college was...

我讨厌这东西012---I hate this thing!
钱德  罗斯是我们的好友012---Come on, Chandler. Ross is our friend.
他现在需要我们帮忙012---He needs us right now.

喔  嗨  丹尼012---Oh, hi, Danny.

谢了  我们有时间就过去012---Oh, thanks, I'll try to stop by.
不过我可能有事012---Uh, Actually, I think, ahem, I'm going to be busy.
是吗012---You are?
对  记得我上次跟你说  要参加开幕酒会012---Yeah.Remember? I've got that, uh, gala.
什么开幕酒会012---What's the gala for?

我这招打得他满脸豆花012---Walked right into that one didn't he?
哪一招012---What one?
你希望他邀你参加派对  他也来啦012---You wanted him to invite you to the party and he did it!
可是  他是等到最后一刻才来012---He waited until the last minute.
如果我答应  他就知道  我没事可做  等着去那白痴派对012---So if I said yes, he would know I had nothing better to do than wait around for an invitation to his stupid party.
我说不去  所以还是我占上风012---I said, "No!" Which puts me right back in the driver seat.
正点  所以换他出招了012---Great. So the ball is in his court?
出招  不  他没招可出了012---Ball? No, there's no ball.
乔伊  麻烦你012---Joey, please.

你是说  这样啊012---Oh. You mean this.
我不知道我还能憋多久012---I don't know how much more I can take.
你知道他竟然拿我的海滩游侠录影带  去录什么怪小虫吗012---Did you know he taped over my Baywatch tape with a show about bugs?
天啊  要是里面录的是A片呢012---My God! What if that had been porn? Oh!
好  听着  这样也许不好过012---All right look, y'know, this may be tough...
但是  是罗斯  我和他一起度过大学生活的012---come on...but it's Ross. I survived college with him.

菲比  这家伙不断关掉大家喜欢去的餐馆012---Pheebs, if this guy keeps closing down all of our favorite places,
以后我们上哪吃饭012---where will we eat?
不晓得  干净的地方吧012---I don't know. Clean places?

不然看看租屋广告吧  不过报上向来没什么好屋子012---Well, I guess I can check out those apartment listings, even though there's never anything in here.
第7页也没有吗012---Not even on page seven?
有啊  你说得对012---Oh, yeah. you're right!
有个地方价钱很公道  两房  上班也近012---Oh, here's an affordable place. Two bedroom, close to work..
可是还要五周才能搬进去012---Ooh, it's available in five weeks

对啊  你不会愿意  继续跟我们住五周012---Yeah, you don't want to be stuck with us for five weeks.

我今天买的  我突然想喝牛奶012---I bought this today, 'cause I was thirsty for milk, y'know.
我们走吧012---Okay, let's go.

你知道卫生规则  11条B款吗  垃圾应该从后门拿出去012---Health Code 11-B of the Health Code that requires all refuse material out the back exit?
可是这样就得从干洗店绕路012---But then I'd have to go all the way around the dry cleaner place.
你宁可方便也不顾卫生012---Oh, so you're saying you'd choose convenience over health?!
够了  赖瑞012---Okay, stop! Larry,
你能不能当赖瑞就好  而不是卫生稽查员赖瑞012---okay, can't you just be Larry and not Larry the health inspector guy?
开始还很刺激012---Y'know I mean it was really exciting at first
