听着  我们玩得很开心012---Well, listen, we had a good run.
总共4个或5个月之久012---You know? What was it? Four, five months?
比很多人一辈子加起来都久012---I mean, that's more than most people have in a lifetime.
再见  保重  再见了012---So goodbye, take care, bye-bye then.
你干什么  我要跑路了012---What are you doing? Oh, I'm going on the lam.
过来  钱德  过来  我应付得了罗斯012---Come on, Chandler. Come on. I can handle Ross.

罗斯老哥  你好吗012---Hey, Ross. What's up, bro?
你干了什么好事012---What the hell are you doing?
发生什么事了012---Hey, what's going on?
我想  罗斯发现我和摩妮卡的事了012---Well, I think-I think Ross knows about me and Monica.
他人就在那里012---Dude, he's right there.
我以为你是我最好的朋友  这是我妹妹啊012---I thought you were my best friend. This is my sister.
我最要好的朋友和我妹妹  我真不敢相信012---My best friend and my sister. I cannot believe this.
我们不是玩玩而已  我爱她012---We're not just messing around. I love her.
我爱着她012---Okay? I'm in love with her.
抱歉让你这样发现012---I'm so sorry that you had to find out this way.
对不起  但是真的  我也爱他012---I'm sorry, but it's true. I love him too.
我最要好的朋友和我妹妹012---My best friend and my sister.
我真不敢相信012---I cannot believe this.
你们也想抱抱吧  这可是个  大消息啊012---You guys want to probably get some hugs in too, huh? Big news.
不用了  我们知道一阵子了012---Oh, no, that's okay. We've actually known for a while.
什么  什么  你们知道012---What? What? You guys knew?
你们都知道  却没告诉我012---You all knew and you didn't tell me?
是啊  罗斯  我们很担心你012---Well, Ross, we were worried about you,okay?
不知道你会有什么反应012---We didn't know how you were going to react.
你们担心我012---You were worried about me?
不知道我会有什么反应012---You didn't know how I was gonna react?
好吧012---Okay. All right. Whew.
你们说  我们要不要清个场012---What do you say we all, uh, clear out of here...
让这对小情人继续办事012---...and let these two love birds get back down to business.
我只是说说  上你妹的是他啊012---Hey, hey, hey. I'm just talking here. He's the one doing your sister.
老友记  第五季  第15集  情海生波012---Friends  S05E15 The One With The Girl Who Hits Joey
你们猜我想到什么012---Hey, you know what I just realized?
要是你们生了小孩  我们生小孩012---If you guys ever have kids-Whoa, whoa, whoa. We're having kids?
教父是我的012---I call godfather.
哪能这样说的012---You can't just call godfather.
你不觉得应该由她哥哥当吗012---Don't you think her brother should be godfather?
当然  你有心就应该先喊012---Sure. If you cared enough to call it first.
你们想得太远了  十万八千里的远012---Guys, you're a few steps ahead of us. Yeah, big zero-gravity moon steps.
我刚想到一样最棒的结婚礼物012---Oh, oh, I just thought of the greatest wedding gift to get you.
我跟你送  我什么都想不到012---Oh, I'll go in on that with you. I couldn't think of anything.
凯蒂012---Hey, Katie.
各位  这是凯蒂  嘿012---Hey, everyone, this is Katie. Hi.
嘿  可以走了吗012---Hi. You ready to go?
可以  我先上个厕所  往后走012---Yeah, just gotta run to the bathroom. Oh sure, right back there.
我们午餐要吃什么  我想吃中国菜012---Hey, where are we going to lunch? I was thinking maybe Chinese food.
我最爱吃中国菜了012---I love Chinese.
你怎么知道我爱吃中国菜012---How did you know I love Chinese?
她真可爱012---She is so cute.
可以塞进口袋里012---You could fit her right in your little pocket.
我不知道  我很喜欢她  她人很好  但是012---I don't know. I mean, I like her a lot, and she's really nice, but...
但是怎样012---But what?
她老爱打我012---She keeps punching me.
用她刚才那种可爱的方式012---In the cute little, sweet way she just did?
力道比表面上看大多了  好吗012---Hey, it's a lot harder than it looks, okay?
她把我打痛了012---She-she-she's hurting me.
我知道了  你需要保镖012---I know what you need. You need a bodyguard.
罗斯  班下课后有事吗012---Hey, Ross, what is Ben doing after preschool?
别这样  乔伊有烦恼了  他被个小女孩揍了012---Okay, come on, Joey is having a problem. There's a little girl who's beating him up.
乔伊  过来012---Aw, Joey, come here. Look.
亲爱的  我知道你一定  一定非常难受012---Honey, I know. This must be really, really difficult for you, and--
抱歉  我握痛你了吗012---Oh, I'm sorry, am I hurting you?
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.

浴室用香精蜡烛012---And a scented candle for the bathroom.
你知道的012---Because, well, you know.
谢谢  谢谢  再次感谢012---Well, thanks. Thanks. And thanks, I guess.
欢迎你搬进来  我是史提夫沙拉  管委会主席012---Hi. Welcome to the building. I'm Steve Cera, President of the tenants' committee.
你好  我是罗斯盖勒  这是我朋友菲比012---Oh, hi. Ross Geller. And, uh, this is my friend Phoebe.
菲比  你好  主席先生012---Hi, Phoebe. Mr. President.
我来跟你谈霍华的事012---I, uh, came to talk to you about Howard.
霍华012---Howard?
是的  他是这里的杂工  下星期退休012---Yeah, he's the handyman. He's gonna be retiring next week...
这里的住户决定每人交一百元012---...and everyone who lives here is kicking in a hundred bucks...
作为"感谢他多年来的辛劳"012---...as a "thank you for all the hard work" type of thing.
真有人情味 是啊012---Oh, that's nice. Yeah.
所以你想开支票还是012---So you want to give me a check, or...?
你不必现在给我  你可以塞进我家门口012---You don't have to give it to me now. You can slip it under my door.
不  不是那样的  我才刚搬来012---No, no, it's not that. It's just-I just moved in.
他在这里工作了25年012---Well, the guy's worked here for 25 years.
但我才搬进来25分钟012---Yes, but I've lived here for 25 minutes.
好012---Oh.
我懂了012---Okay, I get it.
等等  我很抱歉  但我甚至没见过霍华012---No wait, look. Look! I'm sorry, it's just I've never even met Howard.
我不认识霍华012---I mean, I don't know Howard.
霍华是杂务工人012---Howard's the handyman.
但对我来说他只是个人012---Yes, but to me he's just "man."
好  随便012---Okay. Fine. Whatever.
欢迎你搬进来012---Welcome to the building.
真是有够扯的012---Can you believe that guy?
是啊  我很喜欢他的眼镜012---Yeah. I really like his glasses.
史提夫主席逢人就说我吝啬012---So then President Steve told everyone I was a Cheapskate...
现在整栋楼的人都讨厌我012---...and now the whole building hates me.
有小孩朝我的膝盖吐口水012---A little kid spit on my knee.
你们猜怎样  我要办一场派对  邀请整栋楼的人012---You know what? I'm gonna throw a party. That's right, for everyone in the building.
我要请他们坐下  告诉他们  我不是坏人012---And I'm gonna sit them all down and explain to them that I am not a bad guy.
不是吝啬  我只是个012---I am not a cheap guy. I'm just a guy...
坚持理念012---...who stands up for what he believes in.
有原则的人012---A man with principles.
听起来真好玩012---Sounds like a fun party. Mm.
罗斯  如果你希望邻居喜欢你012---Look, Ross, if you want your neighbors to like you...
为什么不付钱算了012---...why don't you just pay the hundred bucks?
办一场派对更花钱  那不重要012---A party's gonna cost you way more. That doesn't matter.
这是原则问题  重点是我的原则012---It's my principles. We're talking about my principles.
好  我以为重点是讨邻居喜欢012---Okay, I thought it was about your neighbors liking you.
等他们参加过我的派对  就会喜欢我了012---Oh, they'll like me once they come to my awesome par-tay.
我得走了  我要去买名牌012---Okay, I gotta run. I gotta go get some nametags.
那个派对动物会是你的大舅子012---And that crazy party animal will be your brother-in-law.
真幽默  但别对着摩妮卡讲012---Very, very funny. But don't say things like that in from of Monica.
别让她有那些念头012---I don't want you putting any ideas in her head.
钱德  你应该知道012---Um, Chandler, you do realize that those ideas...
她可能本来就有那种念头了012---...are probably already in Monica's head?
为什么012---Why?
因为她爱你  你也爱她012---Well, because she loves you and because you love her.
那又怎样呢012---Yeah, so? What's that supposed to mean?
钱德  你不要被吓到  我只是在讲你知道的事012---Hey, Chandler, don't freak out. I'm telling you something you already know.
她因理查不要小孩而跟他分手012---Come on. She broke up with Richard because he didn't want to have babies.
她是个女人  快30了  而且她是摩妮卡012---And she's a woman, and she's almost 30, and, you know, it's Monica.
我不是那样看的  我看到两个摩妮卡012---I don't see it that way. Okay? I see two Monicas:
朋友的摩妮卡住在对面  想生一大堆小孩012---The one that was my friend who lives across the hall and wanted a lot of babies.
另一个新的摩妮卡跟我交往  谁晓得她想要什么012---And the new Monica who I started to date. Now, who is to say what she wants?
我说得没错  我说得没错吧012---I'm right. I'm right. Am I right?
你说得对012---Yeah, you're right.
你说得一点也没错  情况确实完全不同012---You are absolutely right. I mean, that makes everything different.
好吧012---0key.
一点也没有不同  对吧012---It's not different, is it?
除非 "不同"等于一样012---Not unless "different" means the same.
你跟那个服务生好逗喔  你真是个疯子012---You were so funny with that waiter. You're such a nut.
扮吸血鬼本来就好笑012---You know, breads-tick fangs are always funny.
是你让它变好笑的  是你好笑012---No, you make them funny. You're the funny one.
凯蒂  听着  我们得沟通一下012---Uh, look, Katie, uh, listen, we need to talk, okay?
我喜欢你  我真的很喜欢你012---Um, look, I like you. I really do. I like you a lot, okay?
但当你开玩笑打我012---But sometimes when you playfully punch me like that...
感觉就像被一根很小  但很结实的球棒打到012---...it feels like someone's hitting me with a very tiny, but a very real bat.
我哪能把你打痛012---Oh. Like I could hurt you.
你在取笑我的身材吗  没有啊012---Are you making fun of my size? No.
不要取笑我的身材012---Don't make fun of me because of my size.
这种感觉真好012---Isn't this great? Mm.
真想永远这样012---Couldn't you just stay like this forever?
钱德012---Chandler?
你想不想永远这样012---Couldn't you just stay here forever?
这样  那样  哪样都可以012---Yeah, here, somewhere else. You know, wherever. Ha, ha.
你还好吗  我很好012---Are you okay? Yeah. I'm cool.
很随性012---Casual.
你在干什么012---What are you doing?
只是随便混混玩玩  跟你随性的交往012---Just hanging out. Having fun, you know, uh, with the girl that I'm seeing casually.
我就知道  我就知道你会这样012---Man, I knew it. I knew you were going to do this.
怎样012---What?
被大家讨论和开玩笑的事吓到012---Get all freaked out because everybody was joking around about marriage.
你的确想要那些事吧012---Well, you do want all that stuff, right?
你知道我想要什么012---And you know what I want?
没错  你想要小孩  你是孩子狂012---Yes. You want babies. You have baby fever.
我才没有孩子狂012---I do not have baby fever.
拜托  你超迷恋小孩和婚姻012---Oh, please. You are obsessed with babies and marriage...
和一切跟小孩和婚姻有关的事012---...and everything that's related to babies and marriage.
我有个提议  让这个压力锅减压一下吧012---You know what? Why don't we turn the heat down on this pressure cooker?
你疯了吗012---Have you lost your mind?
这不是我的问题012---Chandler, this isn't about me.
是你不敢做出承诺012---This is about you and all your weird relationship commitment crap.
少来  我了解你  我知道你脑袋里在想什么012---Uh-uh. I know you, okay? I know the thoughts that you have in your head.
你并非什么都知道012---Well, you don't know everything.
你知道我今晚要跟瑞秋出去吗012---Did you know I'm going outwith Rachel tonight instead of you? Hmm?
你知道最幼稚的是你吗012---And that the only baby around here is you?
你知道我连看都不想看你吗012---And did you know I can't even look at you right now?
那我倒是不知道012---Yeah, well, I did not know that.
不会有事吧  她不会离开我吧  这是可以解决的012---It's gonna be okay, right? I mean, she's not gonna leave me. This is fixable.
是的  当然012---Yeah, sure. Absolutely.
我可以解决  不  不可能012---By me? Oh, no, no, no.
除非你有大动作012---Well, unless you make some kind of big gesture.
要非常大012---Yeah, big, though.
女主角来了012---Shh. The missus.
阿甘  我要一杯咖啡012---Gunther, can I get a coffee?
外带012---To go.
摩妮卡012---Monica--
我还不想跟你说话012---I'm still not done not wanting to talk to you.
告诉我怎样弥补012---Just tell me what I need to do to make things right.
什么  我们都这样012---What? That's what we do.
我做错事  你教我怎么补救  我补救完012---I mess up, you tell me how to fix it and I do.
然后  你又觉得我很可爱012---And then, you know, you think I'm all cute again.
我不想再当你的爱情指导了012---I'm really tired of being your relationship tutor.
这次你得自己想  好吗012---You're gonna have to figure this out for yourself.
你要知道  如果你懒得好好经营感情012---You know what? If you're too afraid to be in a real relationship...
就别谈感情012---...then don't be in one.
菲比  菲比012---Phoebe.Phoebe.
罗斯012---Oh, hi, Ross.
你在干什么012---What are you doing here?
我以为这是你的派对  结果是替霍华办的派对012---Oh, I thought this was your party, and it turns out it's a party for Howard.
他真是个老可爱012---He's the sweetest little man.
菲比  再见  谢谢你出钱012---See you, Phoebe. Oh, and, hey, thanks for chipping in.
不客气012---Oh, sure.
你出了钱012---You chipped in?
对啊  一百块钱012---Yeah, uh-huh, hundred dollars.
菲比  你居然给他们钱012---Phoebe, I can't believe you gave him money.
你不是也同意他们要我出钱  是很不合理的012---I thought you agreed it was unreasonable that they asked me for that money.
对啊  但他们没有要我出012---Yeah, but they didn't ask me, you know?
当性感大方的陌生人012---This way I'm just, you know, the exotic, generous stranger.
最好玩了012---That's always fun to be.
但你让我很难堪012---Yeah, but you're making me look bad.
不  谁说的  我是在帮你加分012---No, I'm not. No, if anything, I'm making you look better.
他们会看见你在跟我说话  我又很红012---They'll see you talking to me, and I'm a hit.
菲比012---Hey, Pheebs. Hey.
罗斯012---Oh, hey, Ross.
你们或许可以交换住处  012---Urn, say, I was thinking maybe you two could switch apartments.
菲比跟我们比较扎堆012---Because Phoebe is more our kind of people.
你考虑一下012---Something to think about it.
是我不好012---Yeah, okay, my bad.
嘿  嗨012---Hey. Hi.
哇  你看起来好壮012---Wow. You look big.
谢谢  最近有在练012---Thanks, I've been working out.
看得出来我穿六件毛衣吗012---Hey, listen, is it obvious I'm wearing six sweaters?
看得出来012---Uh,yeah.
但看不出来为什么012---But it's not obvious why.
我要跟凯蒂分手  所以得多加几层护垫012---Well, look, I'm breaking up with Katie, so I had to put on some extra padding.
你知道的  她平常高兴就会打我012---You know, I mean, if she hits me when she's happy...
现在我要收回乔伊之爱012---...can you imagine how hard she's gonna hit me...
她岂不是打得更用力012---...when I tell her I'm taking away the Joey love?
嘿012---Hey.
嘿  好可爱的外套012---Hey. Hey, cute jacket.
谢谢012---Oh, thanks.
你真好  哇哦012---That's so sweet. Whoa. Ow.
哇啊012---Oh, "OW."
是乔伊要你叫的吗  你们真是够了012---Did Joey tell you to say that? You guys are too much.
你知道吗  说真的012---You know what? I gotta tell you...
我觉得你才够了012---...I think you're the one that is too much.
乔伊的朋友真棒012---Joey has the nicest friends.
女朋友更棒012---And the nicest girlfriend.
你真好012---You're so sweet.
你才好  哇哦012---You're so sweet. Ow!
乔伊012---Joey?
她踢我012---She just kicked me.
你不替我出头吗012---Well, aren't you gonna do something?
你最好替我出头  否则我现在就走人012---You better do something or I'm gonna walk out that door right now.
你要不要012---Well, are you gonna?
不要012---Nah.
菲比   我就是这个意思012---Phoebe? Ha, ha. That's what I was saying.
菲比  菲比012---Phoebe? Phoebe?
这真是人间地狱  我走了好不好012---This is a disaster. Can't I please just go?
不行  我正在帮你说好话012---No. no. I'm talking you up to people.
再等一下下  放轻松  拿东西吃  好吗012---Just give it a little time, all right? Relax. Get something to eat.Okey.
你跟他们说了什么012---So, uh, what did you tell them about me?
我说了你和艾蜜莉的事  好争取同情心012---Um, I told them about you and Emily. You know, trying to get some sympathy.
但说着说着  你怎么就成了坏人012---But somehow you came off as the bad guy.
什么  我想我说的方式不对012---What? Yeah, I think I told it wrong.
我们应该先聊聊012---We should talk about that...
我不太知道前因后果012---...because I don't totally understand what happened there.
这个蛋糕真好吃012---Oh. This cake is really good.
看吧  情况已经在好转了012---Okay, see? Things are looking up already.
天哪  有人切了霍华的蛋糕012---Oh, my God. Someone cut Howard's cake.
谁会做这种低级的事012---Who would do a thing like that?
3B012---3-B.
你白吃白喝  扫了大家的兴012---Okay, you got your free food, you ruined everyone's fun.
是不是该回家了  没错012---Don't you think it's time you went home? Yeah.
快滚  回3B去  3B012---Yeah, go back to 3-B, 3-B.
大家安静一下  拜托  安静一下012---All right, everyone, calm down. Everyone, calm down.
我有话要说012---I have something that I would like to say.
这里有谁喜欢罗斯012---Who here likes Ross?
你们当然不喜欢他012---Of course you don't like him.
他不交钱012---He didn't give you any money.
我问"有谁喜欢他"  他自己举手012---He raised his own hand when I asked, "Who here likes Ross?"
他还贴两个名牌012---And he's wearing two nametags.
老实说  刚开始我也不喜欢他012---I'll be honest with you guys. When I first met Ross, I didn't like him at all.
但了解他之后  我就发现他012---But then once I got to know him, I saw that he's really sweet...
很好  也很大方012---...and caring and very generous.
请不要还不了解他  就论断他  好嘛012---I mean, all I'm saying is don'tjudge Ross before you get to know him, all right?
我现在很喜欢你们  但是刚见面时012---You know, I like all of you guys now. But when I first met you, you know...
寇特  粗鲁的酒鬼012---Kurt? I thought, you know, abrasive drunk.
萝拉  笨得令人傻眼012---Um, Lola, mind-numbingly stupid.
还有你们  淘金女  老牛吃嫩草的变态012---And, okay, you guys: Gold digger, cradle-robbing perv.
你们懂我的意思吧012---So I think you all know what I mean.
我没想到他们会扔东西012---Obviously, I didn't think they were gonna start throwing things.
我想说我一直羞辱他们  你就会跳出来帮他们012---I just thought if I kept insulting them you would jump in and defend everyone.
你就可以变成英雄012---Then you could look like the hero.
对喔012---Oh, wow, yeah.
太深奥了012---See, I did not get that.
摩妮卡呢  她在哪儿  我有急事找她  她在吗012---Where's Monica? Where is she? I need to talk to her, it's urgent. Is she here?
我是摩妮卡  我有急事要找你  好012---I'm Monica. I need to talk to you. It's urgent.
我想了很多012---Okay. Okay, I've been doing a lot of thinking...
我们的事  很多  你和我的事012---...about us. You know, a lot of, uh, "us" thinking.
我猜只有一个补救的办法012---And, uh, well, I guess there's only one way to do this.
等等  你要干什么  摩妮卡012---Wait, wait. What are you doing? Monica--
不  拜托  不要012---No, no, no. Don't do it.
你愿意嫁给我吗012---Will you marry me?
毁了  什么馊主意012---Oh, no, no, no. What a bad idea.
我不敢看012---Oh, I can't not look at it.
钱德  你为什么要这样012---Chandler, why are you doing this?
我不知道012---I don't know.
但是我知道我不怕012---But I know I'm not afraid to do this.
钱德012---Chandler.
因为我  很抱歉012---I'm doing this because I'm sorry?
你真的觉得结婚的最好理由  是因为你很抱歉012---Do you, urn, really think the best reason to get married is because you're sorry?
不  最好的理由是奉子成婚012---Oh, no, the best reason to get married is pregnancy.
抱歉大约排第四  在准备好了跟真的想结婚后面012---Sorry is pretty much fourth, behind being ready and actually wanting to get married.
你愿意做我的妻子吗012---Will you be my wife?
钱德  你先静下来012---Chandler, um, I want you to take just a minute...
想想这件事有多荒谬012---...and I want you to think about how ridiculous this sounds.
我的确有点希望他们都不在012---Yeah, I'm kind of wishing everyone wasn't here right now.
这些事都不是我扯出来的012---You know that none of that stuff came from me.
我从来没说现在就想结婚生子012---I mean, I never said that I wanted to have babies and get married right now.
但我真的很乱  后来又跟他们谈过012---Yeah, I know, I was really confused, and then I talked to these guys.
谁啊  离婚两次的人和乔伊012---Who? Two divorces and Joey?
她说得对012---Hey. She's right, you know.
但这种奚落算什么012---Yeah, but still, cheap shot.
你知道吗   我不是要你012---You know when I said that I want you...
自己想该怎么做012---...to deal with relationship stuff all on your own?
你还做不到这点  我也这么认为012---Well, you're not ready for that. I didn't think I was.
天哪012---Oh, my God.
要是我答应了呢012---What would you have done if I had said yes?
那我会很开心012---Well, I would've been happy because...
能跟心爱的人共度下半生012---...I would have been able spend the rest of my life with the woman I love.
又或者你会在那扇门上  看到我的人形洞012---Or you would have seen a Chandler-shaped hole in that door.
罗斯  请把刀子给我  不  我才不要012---Hey, Ross, will you pass me that knife? No, I will not.
你不必这么凶吧012---It's okay. You don't have to be so mean about it.
你说得对  对不起  嫁给我好吗012---You're right. I'm sorry. Will you marry me?
我正想向你求婚012---Oh, and I was going to ask you to marry me...
因为我上星期忘了跟你打招呼012---...because I forgot to say hello to you last week.
不  等等  菲比  那种情况012---Oh, no, wait, Pheebs. I think with something like that...
应该只需要同居  但我也不确定  钱德012---...you just ask them to move in with you. But I'm not sure. Chandler?
好  我还要被笑多久012---Ha, ha, okay, how long is this gonna go on?
那得看你012---Well, I think the length of teasing...
做的事有多扯012---...is directly related to how insane you were.
所以  会很久012---So a long time.
真好玩  记得〝我们分手了〞风波吗012---This is fun. Oh, hey, Rach, remember that whole "we were on a break" thing?
我很抱歉  嫁给我好吗012---Well, I'm sorry, will you marry me'?
不好笑012---That's not funny.
