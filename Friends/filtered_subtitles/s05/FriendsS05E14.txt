你们看  丑裸男在收拾东西012---Oh, hey, you guys, look. Ugly Naked Guy's putting stuff in boxes.
看样子  我们的裸友要搬家了012---Huh. I'd say from the looks of it, our naked buddy is moving.
讽刺的是大部分的箱子  都标示着"衣服"012---Ironically, most of the boxes seem to be labeled "Clothes."
我会怀念那个大屁股的012---Aw, I'm going to miss that big old squishy butt.
鸡肉炒饭吃不下了012---And we're done with the chicken fried rice.
嘿  如果他要搬走  也许我可以去把那里租下来012---Hey. Hey, if he's moving, maybe I should try to get his place.
对啊  好主意012---Oh, yeah. Good idea.
跟你们遥遥相对多好玩啊012---It would be so cool to live across from you guys.
那我们就可以玩电话游戏012---Yeah, hey, then we could do that telephone thing...
你一个罐子  我们一个罐子012---...you know, where you have a can, we have a can...
中间有一条线012---...and it's connected by a string.
或者我们也可以打真的电话012---Or we could do the actual telephone thing.
老友记  第五季  第14集  恍然大悟012---Friends  S05E14  The One Where Everyone Finds Out
天哪  我爱死这间公寓了012---Oh, my God. I love this apartment.
很完美吧012---Isn't it perfect?
我居然没发现这里有这么棒012---I can't believe I never realized how great it is.
因为你的目光会马上移到丑裸男身上012---That is because your eye immediately goes to the big naked man.
太棒了012---It's amazing.
你最好赶快去申请  否则我会抢先012---You better hurry up and fill out an application, or I'll beat you to it.
没想到会有这么一天  我要去用丑裸男的厕所了012---Well, I never thought I'd say this, but I'm gonna go use Ugly Naked Guy's bathroom.
你看  是摩妮卡和钱德  喂012---Oh, look. There's Monica and Chandler. Hey!
喂  你们好  喂012---Hey, you guys! Hey!
钱德和摩妮卡  钱德和摩妮卡012---Aah! Chandler and Monica. Chandler and Monica.
天哪012---Oh, my God.
钱德和摩妮卡  天哪012---Chandler and Monica! Oh, my God!
我要瞎了  我要瞎了012---Oh, my eyes! My eyes!
菲比  菲比  嗯012---Phoebe. Phoebe. Ow!
没事的  没事的012---It's okay. It's okay.
不  他们搞在一起了  我知道012---No, they're doing it! I know.
我知道  我知道  你知道012---I know. I know. You know?
对  我知道  乔伊也知道  但罗斯不知道012---Yes, I know, and Joey knows, but Ross doesn't...
所以你别再叫了012---...so you have to stop screaming!
怎么了012---Hey, what's going on?
怎么了 没事012---What? Nothing.
我们只是好兴奋  你要搬到这里来012---Oh, God, we're just so excited that you might get this apartment.
这里的确很棒  很棒012---Actually, it looks really good. Aah! It looks pretty good!
到这儿来  快过来啊012---Get in here! Come on!
你是说每次摩妮卡和钱德  像这样012---You mean whenever Monica and Chandler were, like...
去洗衣服或买东西012---...doing laundry or going grocery shopping...?
她每次跟伤心的琳达讲电话012---All that time Monica spent on the phone with sad Linda from camp?
嘿咻  嘿咻  色情电话012---Uh-huh. Doing it, doing it, phone doing it.
真不敢相信012---I can't believe it.
我是说  真是太好了  对男方来说012---I mean, I think it's great. For him.
女方可以有更好的对象012---She might be able to do better.
你们好  乔伊  快过来  过来012---Hey, you guys. Joey, come here. Come here.
菲比发现摩妮卡和钱德的事了012---Phoebe just found out about Monica and Chandler.
就是说他们是朋友  如此而已012---You mean how they're friends and nothing more?
不  乔伊  她知道了012---No. No, Joey, she knows.
我们刚才在丑裸男的公寓  看到他们隔着窗户在做012---We were at Ugly Naked Guy's apartment and saw them doing it through the window.
应该说是  靠着窗户在做012---Actually, we saw them doing it up against the window.
他们知道你知道  但是不知道瑞秋知道012---Okay, so now they know you know, and they don't know Rachel knows?
对  但现在这些都不重要了012---Yes, but you know what? It doesn't matter who knows what.
我们有三个人知道  就可以告诉他们了012---Now enough of us know that we could just tell them we know.
我再也不必说谎保密了012---Now all the lying and the secrets will finally be over.
或者我们也可以不告诉他们  自己来找点乐子012---Or we could not tell them we know and have a little fun of our own.
什么意思012---Well, what do you mean?
譬如每次他们说要洗衣服012---You know, every time they say they're doing laundry...
我们就给他们一堆衣服洗012---...we'll give them laundry to do.
我喜欢  不  不012---Oh, I would enjoy that. No, no, no.
等等  瑞秋  你知道怎么更好玩吗  告诉他们012---Wait, Rach, you know what would be even more fun? Telling them.
不  我想照菲比的做法  我没办法再012---Yeah, no, I want to do Phoebe's thing. I can't take any--
你只要别说我们知道就行了012---You don't have to do anything. Just don't tell them that we know.
不要  我没办法再保密了012---No. I can't take any more secrets.
我有你们的秘密  他们的秘密  还有我自己的秘密012---I got your secrets, I got their secrets. I got secrets of my own, you know.
你才没有秘密  是吗012---You don't have any secrets. Oh, yeah?
你就不知道  我有个企鹅抱枕叫抱宝012---Well, you don't know about Hugsy, my bedtime penguin pal.
所以012---So, ahem, um...
我们要怎么耍他们012---How are we going to mess with them?
你可以利用室友的身份012---Well, you could use your position，you know,as the roommate.
我就运用我最大的本钱012---And then I would use, you know, the strongest tool at my disposal.
我的性感012---My sexuality.
孩子们  嘿012---Hello, children. Hey.
仔细看  学着点  别吃我的饼干012---Okay. Watch, learn, and don't eat my cookie.
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
你穿这件外套真好看012---Ooh. Wow, that jacket looks great on you.
是吗  对  这个料子摸起来好软012---Really? Yeah. The material looks so soft.
你好啊  二头肌先生012---Oh, hello, Mr. Bicep.
你在健身吗012---You've been working out?
我在挤牙膏012---Well, I try to, you know, squeeze things.
你还好吗012---Are you okay?
如果你真的想知道012---Well, if you really wanna know--
我不能告诉你012---Oh, I can't tell you this.
菲比  是我  你什么都可以告诉我012---Phoebe, it's me, you can tell me anything.
事实上  我就是不能告诉你012---Well, actually, you're the one person I can't tell this to.
但我又最想告诉你012---And the one person I want to the most.
怎么了012---What's going on?
因为我很久没跟男人在一起了012---I think it's just, you know, that I haven't been with a guy in so long...
有时你一直寻寻觅觅012---...and you know how sometimes you're looking for something...
却没发现他就在你眼前喝咖啡012---...and you don't see that it's right there in front of you, sipping coffee...
我说太多了吗012---Oh, no. Have I said too much?
总之你考虑一下  我就会考虑012---Well, just something to think about. I know I will.
你好可爱012---You are so cute. Heh.
你怎么会这么可爱012---How did you get to be so cute?
我爷爷是瑞典人012---Well, my grandfather was Swedish.
我奶奶其实是只拇指兔012---And my grandmother was actually a tiny little bunny.
你变得更可爱了012---Okay, now you're even cuter.
这简直是今天的民意012---You know, that is a popular opinion today, I must say.
什么012---What?
今天在咖啡厅发生了件怪事012---The weirdest thing happened at the coffeehouse.
我觉得菲比在钓我012---I think Phoebe was hitting on me.
你在说什么012---What are you talking about?
是真的  菲比觉得我很有魅力012---I'm telling you, I think Phoebe thinks I'm foxy.
不可能012---It's not possible. Ow.
抱歉  只是在菲比眼中012---I'm sorry, it's just Phoebe's just always thought you were charming...
你的迷人是无性的012---...in a sexless kind of way.
这种话真是百听不厌012---Oh, well, you know, I can't hear that enough.
抱歉  你应该误解她的意思了012---I'm sorry, I just think you misunderstood her.
我没有误解  好吗  她只差没扑上来012---No, I didn't misunderstand, okay? She was all over me.
她还摸我的二头肌呢012---She touched my bicep, for crying out loud.
这块二头肌012---This bicep?
是  我现在没挤它012---Well, it's not flexed right now.
摩妮卡  你要干什么  要不要一起去看电影012---Hey, Mon, what are you doing? Want to come see a movie with us?
事实上  我正要去洗衣服012---Uh, actually, I was going to do some laundry.
钱德  要不要起去  好啊  我跟你一起去012---Chandler, you want to do it with me? Sure, I'll do it with you.
太好了  等一下012---Okay, great. Hold on a second.
拿去012---Unh. Here you go.
不介意吧  这样我就轻松多了  谢了012---You don't mind, do you? That would really help me out a lot. Thanks.
这样  我的硬币应该不够012---Ha, ha. You know what? I don't think I have enough quarters.
我这里有012---Oh, I have quarters.
嘿  罗斯  公寓申请得怎样012---Hey. Hey, Ross, any word on the apartment yet?
我打过去问  原来丑裸男要自己转租012---Well, I called over there, and it turns out Ugly Naked Guy is subletting it himself.
而且已经有一大堆申请者012---And he's already had like 100 applicants.
总之差别是我占了优势012---Oh. No, no, I've got the edge.
我知道这样有点奸诈  但我送了点东西012---I know it's not exactly ethical, but I sent him a bribe...
去贿赂他012---...to tip the scales in my direction.
从窗户搞不好看得到012---Yeah. Check it out, you can see it from the window.
是那个打了蝴蝶结的弹珠台吗012---Oh, is it that pinball machine with the big bow on it?
不是012---No.
那辆新的登山车012---That new mountain bike?
不是012---No.
那你送什么012---Well, what did you send?
一篮小英式松饼012---A basket of mini muffins.
但桌上全都是小英式松饼012---There's a whole table of mini muffin baskets.
哪一篮是你送的012---Which one did you send?
小的那一篮012---The small one.
什么  你真以为那篮松饼  能帮你争取到公寓012---What? You actually thought that basket was gonna get you the apartment?
对012---Well, yeah.
我们办公室曾经收到一篮  大家都爱得不得了012---Someone sent us a basket at work once and people went crazy over those muffins.
那天真的很高兴012---It was the best day.
你的工作让我觉得好悲惨012---Your work makes me sad.
真是的  我好想要那间公寓012---Oh, man, I want that place so much.
我还以为一定会成功012---And I was so sure that was going to work.
那12块算是丢到水里了012---There's 12 bucks I'll never see again.
好了  想看电影就得快了012---All right, we'd better go if we're gonna catch that movie.
再见  再见012---Bye. Bye.
钱德  再见  我已经开始想你了012---Bye, Chandler. I miss you already.
你看到她了  嗲里嗲气  还捏我吗012---Okay, did you see that? With the inappropriate, and the pinching?
看到了012---Actually, I did.
你相信她对我有意思了吧012---So now do you believe that she's attracted to me?
天哪  她知道我们的事了012---Oh, my God. Oh, my God. She knows about us.
真的还假的012---Are you serious?
菲比知道了  她想吓我们012---Phoebe knows, and she's just trying to freak us out.
这是唯一的解释012---That's the only explanation for it.
那我好捏的屁股和激凸的二头肌呢012---Okay, but what about my pinchable butt and my bulging biceps?
她知道了012---She knows.
乔伊012---Joey.
怎样012---Yeah?
菲比知道我们的事了012---Phoebe knows about us.
我没告诉她们012---Well, I didn't tell them.
她们  "她们"是谁012---Them? Who's "them"?
菲比和乔伊012---Uh, Phoebe and Joey.
乔伊012---Joey.
和瑞秋012---And Rachel.
我想告诉你们  但她们逼我不能说012---Look, I would have told you, but they made me promise not to tell.
天哪  对不起012---Oh, man. I'm sorry.
那现在没事了吧012---But, hey, it's over now, right?
你们可以告诉她们你们知道了012---Because you can tell them you know they know...
我就可以恢复我状况外的本色了012---...and I can go back to knowing absolutely nothing.
除非  没有"除非"  现在就要了结012---Unless-No, not "unless." This must end now.
她们还自以为高明012---Oh, man, they think they are so slick messing with us.
她们不知道我们知道她们知道012---But they don't know that we know that they know.
所以  没错012---So. Ah, yes.
耍人的要变成被耍的了012---The messers become the mes-sees.
罗斯  别再折磨自己了012---Oh, Ross, honey, you gotta stop torturing yourself.
你为什么不去找别的公寓嘛012---Why don't you just find another apartment?
我这个月已经看了上千间公寓012---I've already looked at like a thousand apartments this month.
没有哪一间比得上那一间012---None of them even compares to that one.
你知道你应该怎么做012---You know what you should do?
你应该找出他的嗜好  拿来跟他套交情012---You should find out what his hobbies are and then use that to bond with him.
例如我对乔伊有所求012---Yeah. Like if I wanted something from Joey...
我就会聊  三明治012---...I would strike up a conversation about, say, urn, sandwiches...
或是我的内衣012---...or, uh, my underwear.
我在听012---I'm listening.
看吧012---See?
好棒的主意012---That is a great idea.
而且我了解丑裸男  因为我们偷窥了他5年012---And I know Ugly Naked Guy because we've been watching him for five years.
所以我又重新占了上风012---So that gives me back my edge. Ha, ha.
好  他有一张跳床012---Let's see now. He had the trampoline.
被他跳坏了  他有双倒吊鞋012---But he broke that. Well, he had gravity boots.
也被他穿坏了012---Yeah, he broke those too.
所以他喜欢破坏东西012---So he likes to break stuff.
好  我得去接小班  不过我会想出来的012---Okay, I've got to go pick up Ben, but I will figure something out.
他之前不是有一只猫012---Hey, didn't he used to have a cat?
别提那个  会害他心情不好012---I wouldn't bring that up. It would probably just bum him out.
可怜的猫咪  没看到大屁股压下来012---Poor cat never saw that big butt coming.
喂012---Hello?
在  等一下  她就在旁边012---Oh, yeah, hey. Hold on a second, she's right here.
钱德找你012---It's Chandler.
你好012---Hello, you.
菲比  我一整天都在想你012---Hello, Phoebe, I've been thinking about you all day.
你之前的提议  说我不心动是骗人的012---Well, you know that thing you said before? I'd be lying if I said I wasn't intrigued.
是吗012---Really?
对  听着  乔伊晚上不在012---Yeah. Listen, Joey won't be here tonight.
你要不要过来  我让你模我的二头肌012---Why don't you come over and I'll let you, uh, feel my bicep.
或者是别的地方012---Or maybe more.
我待会再给你答覆  再见012---I'll have to get back to you on that. Okay, bye.
天哪  他找我去模他的二头肌和别的地方012---Oh, my God. He wants me to come over and feel his bicep and more.
不会吧  是真的012---Are you kidding? No.
他居然背着摩妮卡012---I cannot believe he would do that to Mon--
乔伊  他们知道我们知道吗012---Joey? Do they know that we know?
不知道  乔伊012---No. Joey?
他们知道你们知道了  我就知道012---They know you know. Ooh, I knew it.
那两个人真扯012---Oh, I cannot believe those two.
他们以为他们可以耍我们  想耍我们是吧012---God, they thought they can mess with us! They're trying to mess with us?! 
他们不知道我们知道  他们知道我们知道了012---They don't know that we know they know we know.
乔伊  你不能说012---And, Joey, you can't say anything.
我也不想说了012---I couldn't even if I wanted too.
你好  我是罗斯盖勒012---Good evening, sir. My name is Ross Geller.
我也申请要租你的公寓012---I'm one of the people who applied for the apartment...
我知道竞争很激烈  但是012---...and I realize that the competition is fierce, but...
抱歉  我注意到你光着身体012---I'm sorry, I can't help but notice that you're naked and...
我为你鼓掌012---I applaud you-
我也好想光着身体012---Man, I wish I was naked.
看起来好舒服012---I mean, this-this looks so great.
这正是上帝造人的本意012---That is how God intended it.
你看她们多慌  她们绝对会退缩012---Look at them. They're panicked. Oh, yeah, they're totally gonna back down.
没错012---Oh, yeah.
好  他敢约我  我就敢去012---All right, if he wants a date, he's going to get a date.
我要过去了  好012---I'm going to go in. Okay, okay.
性感一点012---Be sexy.
拜托012---Please.
钱德  我晚上可以过去012---So, Chandler, I'd love to come by tonight.
真的012---Really?
当然  就7点吧012---Oh, absolutely. Should we say around 7?
好012---Yes.
很好  我很期待跟你发生性关系012---Good. I'm really looking forward to you and me having sexual intercourse.
快来看  丑裸男有裸友来访012---Hey, hey, check it out, check it out. Ugly Naked Guy's got a naked friend.
真的012---Oh, yeah.
天哪  那是我们的朋友012---Oh, my God. That's our friend.
是裸罗斯  是罗斯012---It's Naked Ross. It is Ross!
上场喽012---Showtime.
瑞秋  拿香水来012---Okay, Rachel, get me perfume.
乔伊  帮我拿一瓶酒和两个酒杯012---And, Joey, could't you get me a bottle of wine and glasses?
放心好了012---All right, it'll be great.
只要让她以为你想跟她上床  她绝对会吓到012---You just make her think you want to have sex with her and it'll freak her out.
那么  听着  我到底得撑到什么程度012---Okay, listen, how far am I gonna have to go with her?
别紧张  她会比你先投降012---Relax, she's gonna give in way before you do.
你怎么知道  因为你跟我同队012---How do you know? Because you're on my team.
我这一队总是赢012---And my team always wins.
赢这种事012---At this?
总之去吓她  快去012---Just go get some. Go.
好  我会站在门外听012---Okay, honey, now, I'm gonna try to listen from right here.
好  等下012---Okay. Okay. Oh, wait.
好主意  等等012---Good idea. Yeah.
别把料都爆光了  好012---Don't give away the farm. Okay.
菲比012---Phoebe.
钱德  进来吧012---Chandler. Come on in.
我正要进去012---I was going to.
我带了酒来  你要吗012---Um, I brought some wine. Would you like some?
好啊012---Sure.
总算要开始了  紧张吗012---So here we are. Nervous?
我不会  你呢012---Me? No. You?
不会  这样正合我意012---No. I want this to happen.
我也是012---So do I.
我去放点音乐012---I'm going to put on some music.
那我 我跳舞给你看好了012---Maybe-Maybe I'll dance for you.
你真美012---You look good.
谢谢012---Thanks. Heh.
你说这种话让我好想012---You know, when you say things like that, it makes me wanna...
扯掉你的毛衣背心012---...rip that sweater vest right off.
不如进房里再说吧012---Well, why don't we move this into the bedroom?
真的吗  你不想吗012---Really? Oh, do you not want to?
不是  不是012---No. No.
只是我想先脱掉衣服012---I just, you know, first, I wanna take off all my clothes...
让你替我擦乳液012---...and have you rub lotion on me.
听起来不错012---Well, that would be nice.
我去拿乳液012---I'll go get the lotion.
情况完全失控了  她要我帮她擦乳液012---This is totally getting out of hand, okay? She wants me to put lotion on her.
她在吓你  她没打算放弃012---She's bluffing. Look, she's not backing down.
她还这样012---She went like this--
他没打算放弃  他去拿乳液了012---He's not backing down. He went to get lotion.
真是的  你们还没好吗012---Oh, man, aren't you guys done yet?
我想坐我的椅子012---I want to sit in my chair.
乔伊   菲比一突破钱德的心里防线012---Joey, look at it this way, the sooner Phoebe breaks Chandler...
这一切就结束公开了012---...the sooner this is all over and out in the open.
我喜欢012---Ooh, I like that.
我知道  让他看你的胸罩  他怕胸罩  他解不开012---Oh, okay. Show him your bra. He's afraid of bras. Can't work them.
乔伊012---Joey!
你没把扣子都挑开012---Wow, you didn't rip off any buttons.
老经验了012---It's not my first time.
你给我回去  色诱她让她屈服012---You go back out there and you seduce her till she cracks.
好  等一下012---Okay. Give me a second.
你打扫过吗  当然喽012---Did you clean up in here? Of course.
你…要走了012---Oh, you're, uh-You're going?
除非你跟我走  爱人012---Um, not without you, lover.
这是我的胸罩012---So this is my bra.
非常  非常好看012---It's very, very nice.
过来012---Well, come here.
我很高兴我们要做爱了012---I'm very happy we're gonna have all the sex.
你是该高兴  我的身体很柔软012---You should be. I'm very bendy.
我要吻你了  除非我先吻你012---I'm gonna kiss you now. Not if I kiss you first.
接下来就只能接吻了012---Well, I guess there's nothing left for us to do but kiss.
