我要点咖啡外带  洋娃娃  你也要吗012---Would you like some more coffee, baby-doll?
不用了  谢谢012---I'm fine. Thanks.
我不能叫你洋娃娃吧012---Yeah, see, I can't pull of "baby doll," can I?
对  从那次甜甜嘴事件  我们已经学到教训了012---No, I think we learned that from the "sugar lips" incident.
我去点茶来喝012---I'm gonna get some tea. Okay.
小亲亲  你好吗012---How you doing, pumpkin?
行不通012---Nope.
你们俩看起来越来越好了呢012---So it looks like it's going really well for you two, huh?
我知道  真的很好  其实我正想要菲比搬来我家012---I know. Really well. In fact, I'm gonna ask Phoebe to move in with me.
天啊  你觉得呢012---Oh, my God. What do you think?
我觉得这真是太棒了  你什么时候要问她012---I think that it's so great. When are you gonna ask her?
今晚  你先别透露啊012---Tonight. But don't say anything, okay?
我发誓不说  人格担保012---I swear. I promise. I promise.
天啊  我超兴奋的012---My God, I'm so excited.
我跟你说  记得不要送她花012---All right, listen let me tell you, do not get her flowers. Okay?
因为花谢了  她会哭  还会帮花办葬礼之类的012---Because y'know, she cries when they die, and there's the whole funeral
亲爱的  下班后再见  好  再见012---I'll see you after work, sweetie. Okay. Bye.
我们应该去看什么电影012---So, what movie should we see?
盖瑞要请你搬过去跟他住012---Gary's gonna ask you to move in with him.
什么  真的吗  他刚才在吧台上跟我说的012---What? Really? He just told me at the counter.
他要我保证不会说出去  但我实在是憋不住了012---He made me promise not to tell but I couldn't hold it in any longer.
我不敢相信  对  因为太快了  太快012---I can't believe this. Right? Because it's fast. Because it's so fast. It's fast.
别激动  是菲比  又不是你012---Relax. It's Phoebe, not you. Oh.
菲比  很厉害  有一套012---Good for you, Pheebs. Way to go.
不过真的是很快  对吧  才不是呢012---No, but it is fast, isn't it? No.
我是很喜欢他  没错  但我还没有准备好要同居012---I like him a lot but I don't think I'm ready.
那你打算怎么办  不知道  兵来将挡012---So, what are you gonna do? I don't know. I'll just handle it.
干脆找你去疏通他012---I'll ask you to talk to him.
我   为何是我012---Me? Why me?
因为给予承诺  你最怕了012---Because you are so afraid of commitment.
你去跟他说说  让他也跟你一样怕012---You talk to him. Make him scared like you,
让他成为一个  男人012---make him a man.
我会去试试   但我不确定会多有用012---I'll try, but I'm not sure what good it would do...
因为比起以前  我现在已经很不害怕承诺了012---...because I'm less afraid of commitment than I used to be.
真是太甜蜜了012---That is so sweet.
还是很怕  但我会处理  没问题012---Still terrified. I'll take care of it no problem.
老友记  第五季  第21集  掷球游戏012---Friends  S05E21  The One With The Ball
罗斯   斯塔顿岛真的是岛吗012---Hey, Ross, is, uh, Staten Island really an island?
是啊  所以才叫斯塔顿〝岛〞012---Uh-huh. That's why they call it Staten "Island."
我还以为那跟长岛一样012---Oh, I thought it was like Long Island.
长岛也是岛012---Also an island.
几点了  2点17分012---Hey, what time is it? Two seventeen.
你知道吗  我们丢这个球012---Wow, you realize we've been throwing this ball
连续一小时都没有漏接落地012---without dropping it for an hour?
你说真的012---Are you serious?
对  我半小时前就发现了  我怕坏了好事才没说012---Yeah, I realized it a half-hour ago, but I didn't wanna say anything because I didn't wanna jinx it.
哇  我们还真会丢接球呢012---Wow, we are pretty good at this.
我们完全忘了吃午饭012---Hey, we totally forgot about lunch.
这是我第一次忘记吃饭012---I think that's the first time I've ever missed a meal.
对  我的裤子都有点松了012---Yeah, my pants are a little loose!
嗨  两位  摩妮卡在吗012---Hey, you guys. Uh, is Monica here?
不在  不在012---No. No.
听着  我带了东西回来  我不确定她会喜欢012---All right listen umm, I just bought something I'm not sure she's gonna like it,
听起有点奇怪012---And it's gonna seem crazy...
那个东西我从小就想要了012---...but this is something I've wanted since I was a little girl.
你带史恩卡希迪来012---You bought Shaun Cassidy.
不是  我也希望是012---No. I wish.
你们准备好了没   好了012---Okay, you ready? Yeah.
那好012---OK
请看012---Check it out.
那是啥啊  什么鬼东西012---Oh, my God. What is it? What the hell is that?
这是猫啊012---It's a cat.
这才不是猫012---That is not a cat.
这就是猫啊012---Yes, it is.
他的皮怎么翻出来了012---Why is it inside out?
帮帮忙012---Excuse me,
这可是展示级的  纯种狮身人面猫012---but this is a purebred, show-quality sphinx cat.
你花了多少钱买的012---How much did you pay for that?
有点奢侈  但我谈到了很好的价钱012---Well, it was a little extravagant, but I got a pretty good deal.
是吗  多少钱012---Yeah, how much?
一千美元012---A thousand bucks.
买一只猫012---On a cat?
那才不是猫012---It's not a cat.
你们这两个玩球的  给我听好了012---All right. Listen, ball boys.
我小时候祖母就养了这种猫  他们最讨人喜欢了012---My grandmother had one of these when I was little. and it was the sweetest thing.
超可爱的  躺在我的膝盖上  整天满足地喵喵叫012---I mean, it was so cute, it would sit in my lap and just purr all day long...
我还会拿鞋带在地上拖  让他追着跑012---...and I would drag a shoe string on the ground and it would chase it.
不要钱的猫也会那样啊012---Free cats do that too, you know.
那才不是猫012---It's not a cat.
反正我买得很兴奋  我才不管你们怎么想012---Look, guys, I'm really excited about this, okay? I don't care what you think.
我要去帮威丝克森太太   张罗出一个小猫砂盒012---I'm gonna go set up a little litter box for Mrs. Whiskerson.
不然我要叫他〝毛毛〞吗012---Well, what am I gonna call her? Fluffy?
你要去吃点东西吗012---Hey, do you wanna get something to eat
还是要看我们能来回丢多久012---or, uh..do you wanna see how long we can throw this ball back and forth? Huh?
继续丢球  是啊012---Uh, the ball thing. Yeah?
罗斯  若我们连丢两小时不落地  那样是不是很棒012---Hey, Ross, wouldn't it be great if we could go for like two straight hours without dropping it?
当然啦012---Uh, yeah, it would.
来吧  好012---Let's do it. Okay.
怎么了012---Uh-oh. What?
我要尿尿  但瑞秋在厕所里012---I have to pee. And Rachel's in the bathroom.
没想到这样也行012---Man, I didn't think we were gonna make it.
是啊012---I know.
你别换手喔012---Don't switch hands, okay?
小姐们  你们在这里干嘛012---Hey, ladies. What are you in here for?
钱德  你来这里干嘛012---Hey, Chandler, what are you doing here?
盖瑞  我是来报案的  是吗012---Gary, I am here to report a crime. Yeah?
我们俩不常聚在一起  是一种罪012---It is a crime that you and I don't spend more time together.
你有什么事012---Ha, ha. What's up?
听说你在考虑要菲比跟你同居012---Uh, well, I heard that you were thinking about asking Phoebe to move in with you...
我心想我们或许应该聊聊  男人跟我的对话012---...and I thought maybe we should have a talk, you know, man to... well, me.
好啊  没问题012---Sure, okay.
你在发什么神经012---Um, are you crazy?
你疯了  若你和菲比同居  你们两个就会住在一起了012---Are you insane? If you live with Phoebe, you two are gonna be, you know, living together.
对  我考虑过了  我知道这会让我快乐012---Yeah, I considered that. I just know it'd make me happy.
你是说害怕吧  不  我是说快乐012---Heh. You mean scared. No, I mean happy.
害怕  快乐012---Scared happy.
钱德  你在干嘛012---Chandler, what are you doing?
我在让你张开眼睛啊  你看不出来吗012---I am trying to open your eyes, my man! Don't you see,
若你和菲比同居  她就永远都会在012---if you lived with Phoebe she's always gonna be there.
你回家会看到她  你上床也会看到她012---You're gonna get home, she's there. You go to bed, she's there.
你起床呢  对  她还是在012---You wake up and oh, yes, she's there.
我知道  我都等不及了012---I know. I can't wait.
你父母的婚姻很幸福  对吧012---Were your parents happy or something?
钱德  我看这件事的角度是  我很幸运能找到我的真爱012---Listen, Chandler, the way I see it. I was lucky enough to find someone that I really love.
我想要尽量多跟她在一起012---I just wanna be around her as much as I can.
怪了  这件事从你嘴里说出来  感觉就没那么恐怖了012---Wow, you know, when you say it, it doesn't sound so scary.
所以你懂我的意思吧   对  我想我懂012---So you know what I'm talking about? Yeah, I think I do.
这样吧  跟她同居012---You know what? You move in with her.
马上  就去跟她同居012---You move in right with her right now.
或许我也应该和摩妮卡同居012---Maybe I should move in with Monica.
不成  你们不能操之过急012---No, it's too soon for you guys.
是啊  你说的对012---Yeah, you're right about that.
他们找到中生代乳齿象化石012---…now when they found the remains of the Mesozoic mastodon...
却在嘴部发现到  类似古生代两栖类的构造012---...they discovered what appeared to be the remains of a Paleozoic amphibian in its jaws.
怎么会牛头不对马嘴012---How did it get there?
或许这个游戏应该安静一点012---Maybe this should be more of a quiet game.
嗨  嗨012---Hey, guys. Hey.
乔伊  我昨晚把手表放在柜子上012---Joey, I left my watch on the counter last night.
本来还在这里  到哪儿去了012--- It was right here, Where is it?
我不知道  别闹了  我上班快迟到了012---I don't know. Well, come on, I'm late for work.
你怎么知道  你又没戴表012---How do you know? You don't have a watch.
你们能不能停一下再丢球  先帮我找表012---Guys, could you stop throwing the ball for one minute and just help me find it?
不知道  没办法喔012---Oh, I don't know. Yeah, can't do it.
怎样啦012---What?
怎样都好  千万别把球掉地上012---Whatever you do, do not drop that ball
我们保持球不落地已经012---Yeah, we haven't dropped it in...
2小时27分钟012---Two hours, 27 minutes.
真的啊012---Really?
我今天没办法去上班  我人不太舒服012---I'm not gonna be able to make it in to work today. Um, I don't feel very good.
漂亮012---Yes!
我刚才突然觉得自己好多了  但其实没有012---Wow, uh, for a second there, I thought I was feeling better, but I'm not.
瑞秋  嗨012---Hey, Rach. Hey.
快来看  球不落地接近三小时012---Check it out. Almost three hours without dropping it.
恭喜了  真是浪费时间012---Wow, congratulations. That's quite a waste of time.
瑞秋  怎么了012---Rach. Yeah.
你身上都是抓痕  怎么了012---You have scratches all over you. What happened?
是我的猫  什么012---Well, it's my cat. What?
对了  我养了只猫  我不想养猫了012---Oh, yeah, I got a cat. I don't want a cat.
别担心  那不是猫  没错012---Oh, don't worry, it's not a cat. Yeah.
这只猫跟我祖母养过的猫  完全不一样012---You guys, this cat is nothing like my grandmother's cat.
既不讨人喜欢  也不可爱012---It's not sweet. It's not cute.
我在地上拉着线逗他玩012---I even dragged a string on the ground...
他竟然发飙  把我抓得乱七八糟012---...and it just flipped out and scratched the hell out of me.
我知道这听来很疯狂  但我发誓012---And I swear... I know this sounds crazy,
这只猫每次嘘我的时候  我知道他都在说〝瑞秋〞012---but every time this cat hisses at me I know it's saying, "Rachel."
花一千美元买一只猫  比刚才那些话更疯狂012---Doesn't sound as crazy as paying $1000 for a cat.
你欠我三百美元不还  还拿一千美元去买猫012---You paid $1000 for a cat when you owe me 300?
我本来打算让你跟他玩的012---Well, I was gonna let you play with it.
嗨012---Hey.
你跟盖瑞聊过同居的事没012---Hmm, Did you talk to Gary about the moving in thing?
聊过了  我觉得你应该答应012---Yes, I did, and I think you should do it.
什么012---What?
他很棒  他也很爱你  你非常幸运012---He's a great guy, y'know? and he loves you a lot. You are a very lucky lady.
你真没用012---You are useless.
害怕承诺是你唯一会做的事012---Freaking out about commitment is the one thing you can do...
你竟然连那件事都做不好  天啊012---The one thing! And you can't even do that right! God!
抱歉012---Sorry.
换做我都愿意和他同居012---If he asked me, I'd move in with him.
窝囊废  你滚吧012---get out of here, good-for-nothing.
嘿  钱德  嘿  盖瑞012---Hey, Chandler. Hey, Gar.
亲爱的012---Hey, sweetie.
能不能先聊下  好啊012---Can I talk to you for a second? Yeah. .
好012---Okay
你今天很美012---You look very pretty today.
谢谢  好吧012---Thanks. Okay.
是这样的  好012---Here's the thing. Yeah.
我很想让这段关系更进一步012---You know, I really want this relationship to move forward.
因为不进则退012---Because if you're not moving forward, you know, you're just moving backwards.
不是那样的  真的  如果不进  就是静止不动012---Now, that's not true. If you're not moving forward, you're staying still.
静止不动是很好的  你看012---And staying still is good. Watch this.
菲比  是012---Phoebe? Yeah?
我要你搬来一起住012---I want you to move in with me.
那真是太甜蜜了012---That is so sweet.
但你不觉得稍微太快了点吗012---But don't you think that it's a little it's too soon?
我们彼此  还有很多地方并不太了解012---I mean, there's so much we don't know about each other.
好吧  我懂了012---Oh, okay. I get it.
我只是  不希望我们操之过急  你懂吧012---I just—I don't want us to jump into something that we're not ready for, you know.
我不想搞砸我们现在的一切012---I really don't want to mess up what we have.
我担心同居会铸成大错012---I'm just—I'm worried it's gonna be a big mistake.
是啊012---Yeah.
所以我的答案是  我答应012---Which is why my answer is yes.
真的吗012---Really? Uh-huh.
你好高兴012---Uh-huh! You're so happy.
摩妮卡  别用那么大力气012---Monica, stop throwing it so hard.
我们是同一队012---We're on the same team.
四个小时  你们就这样丢了四小时012---Four hours? You guys have been doing this for four hours?
宝贝  没错012---That's right, baby.
好  让我加入  不  不行012---All right. Let me in. No, no. Don't do it.
什么012---What?
他是漏球大王012---He's a dropper.
对  没错012---Oh, yeah. That's right.
我才不是漏球大王012---I'm not a dropper.
这其实是三个人的游戏012---It's really a three-person game, you know?
还不就是你丢我接012---It's throwing and catching.
好吧012---All right.
喔  好难啊012---Oh, oh, it's so hard.
别紧张  那不是猫啊012---Don't worry, guys. It's not a cat.
我的  天啊012---Oh, my... Oh, good God.
我放弃了  我不知道要怎么处理这玩意儿012---I give up, you guys. I don't know what I'm gonna do with this thing.
送他进烤箱也没用012---Baking it didn't help, huh?
送回你买的地方呢012---Why don't you just take it back to where you got it?
我试过了  他们不收012---I tried. They won't take her back.
或许是因为他是反基督的爪牙012---Maybe that's because she's a minion of the Antichrist.
瑞秋  店家为什么不收012---Rach, why won't they take it back?
他们说要收回可以  但只退我店里的购物券012---Well, they said they would, but would only give me store credit.
我用它来买什么呢   一千只普通的猫不成012---What am I gonna do, get a thousand regular cats?
不然你先留着  等到你找到处理的方法012---If you want, you can keep it until you find out what to do with it.
不行  那不是重点012---No, Mon, that's not the point.
我花费一千美元  却搞得全身都是抓痕012---I'm out a thousand dollars.I'm all scratched up
还跟长得像手的蠢猫困在一起012---and I'm stuck with this stupid cat that looks like a hand.
天啊  那只猫害我流眼泪了012---Oh, my God. The cat's made my eyes water.
别给我丢球012---Don't throw it to me.
我的视力受损了012---My vision's been compromised.
天啊  好了012---Oh, God. Okay. Okay.
现在好了  真是惊险012---It's okay. Man, that was close.
是啊  你的反应也太大了点012---Yeah, you almost overreacted to something.
我们有个好消息  我们要同居了  是不是很棒012---We have great news. We're moving in together. Isn't it great?
恭喜  是啊  我好兴奋012---Congratulations. That's great.I know, I'm so excited.
我也是012---So am I.
你才没有我兴奋  不可能  我是最兴奋的012---Well, you're not more excited than I am. No way. I'm the most excited. Ha.
好  晚点在局里见012---Okay, I'll see you at the station later.
好  晚点见  别忘了同居的事012---Okay, yeah, I'll see you later. Don't forget about the moving-in.
你要搬去跟他住  怎么了012---So you're moving in with him? What happened?
我不忍心拒绝他  看他伤心成那样012---I couldn't tell him no. He got so sad.
或许不会有事的012---But maybe it'll be all right.
我真的很喜欢他  同居八成也是迟早的事012---I do really like him a lot. and probably do it eventually anyway.
想想也可以省下不少邮票钱012---And plus, think of all the money I'll save on stamps.
怎么着  你常写信给他012---Why, do you write him a lot?
不是  只是我听说同居的人  会分担邮票的费用  不是吗012---No, I just heard when people live together, they split the cost of stamps. Don't they?
是啊  没错012---Yeah, yeah. That's right.
抱歉  耐热手套吓了我一跳012---Oh, I'm sorry, the oven mitts really freaked me out.
嘿  亲爱的012---Hey, honey.
你找到公寓没有  布鲁克林高地有吗012---Okay, so did you find any apartments? Anything in Brooklyn Heights?
没有  没找到012---No, nothing.
真的  是啊012---Oh, really? Yeah.
问都没有  没有012---Nothing at all? No.
只要有公寓招租  我们马上搬进去012---As soon as something opens up, we'll move right in.
不过要有附泳池的  我需要泳池012---Unless it doesn't have a pool. I need a pool.
菲比  可以跟你聊一下吗012---Phoebe, can I talk to you for a second? Uh-huh.
请坐  好012---Take a seat. Okay.
你没事吧  还好吧012---You okay? You feel all right?
我很好啊  因为我们要同居了012---Yeah, I feel great because we're moving in together.
报上布鲁克林高地的租屋广告  你都看过了012---So you, uh.You checked the paper for listings in Brooklyn Heights, right?
《邮报》你有查过吗012---You-you checked the Post?
有查啊  啥都没有012---Yeah, uh-huh, there was nothing.
我能喝点水吗   等下012---Can I get some water? In a minute.
你查过今天的《邮报》吗012---You checked today's Post?
对  我是看今天的012---Um, yeah, today's.
这是今天的《邮报》012---Hmm. Because, uh, this is today's Post.
我找到了这些租屋广告012---And, uh, these are the listings I found.
布鲁克林高地  两房012---Brooklyn Heights, two bedrooms.
布鲁克林高地  一房012---Brooklyn Heights, one bedroom.
布鲁克林高地区  布鲁克林高地区  布鲁克林高地区012---Brooklyn Heights, Brooklyn Heights, Brooklyn Heights.
这些是要租的吗012---Oh, are these for rent?
我以为他们是在炫耀自己的房子有多棒012---I thought people were just bragging.
我来告诉你  我的想法012---Let me tell you what I think might be going on here.
不要看桌子  看着我012---No, no, don't look at the table. Look at me.
好吧  一个男生要求一个女生同居012---Okay, I think somebody asked someone to move in with him.
女生本来说好  现在反悔了012---And I think someone said yes, but now she's having doubts...
因为女生觉得这样太快了012---...because things are moving too fast for someone.
你觉得是不是这样012---Does that sound at all possible to you?
对  好  我就是那个女生012---Yes, yes. Yes, fine, I am someone.
你要我说老实话  对  我是不确定012---You want me to say it? I have doubts.
对不起012---I'm sorry.
菲比  什么事012---Phoebe. Yeah?
菲比  你有这种感觉也没关系012---Phoebe, it's okay that you feel this way.
这真的是很快  我们彼此有许多地方不了解012---I mean, it is soon, and there's a lot of things we don't know about each other.
我只是觉得  我知道的你  我都很喜欢012---I just figured everything I know about you, I really like.
我还不知道的你  就等同居后再慢慢了解012---The things I don't know, I get to learn in a place with both our names on the mailbox.
那样好甜蜜啊012---That's so sweet.
亲爱的012---Sweetheart,
如果你觉得这样太快了  就不行的话012---but none of that matters if it's too soon for you.
