什么  我买了条超小号的内裤012---What? Well, I got this pair marked "XS."
我告诉你吧  里面根本塞不下多余的东西012---Let me tell you, there was no room for excess anything in there.
反正我的工作是女装部的联络人012---Anyway, I'm gonna be the coordinator of the women's collection.
我直接在主管底下做事  这是我梦寐以求的工作012---I'll work right under the director. It's the perfect job for me.
如果你通过面试就成了  是啊012---Wow. Well, if you nail the interview, you'll get it.
要不要练习一下面试技巧012---Yeah. Want to work on your interview skills?

我来试试  好的012---Let me try. Okey.
好的  天啊  我是哪里对不起你了012---Oh, my God! What did I ever do to you?
我握得太用力吗012---Did I squeeze too hard?
这么说吧  好在我不是钱德012---Let's just say I'm glad I'm not Chandler.

没错  罗斯  我能看到你在新公寓012---That's right, Ross. I can see you in your new apartment.
你也看得到我012---And you can see me!
跟昨天一样  跟前天也一样012---Same as yesterday, same as the day before.
他开始演鲨鱼攻击了没有012---Is he doing his "shark attack" bit yet?
还没开始  等等  他开始了012---No. Oh, wait! There he goes.
罗斯  很好笑012---Very funny, Ross.
栩栩如生  又好笑012---Very lifelike and funny. Okay.
不  不  小姐  我不是向你挥手012---Oh, no, no, no. I wasn't waving at you, lady.
哇  或许我是啊012---Whoa, maybe I was.
嘿  摩妮卡  罗斯那栋楼里  有个辣妹在勾引我012---Hey! Monica, this hot girl in Ross' building is flirting with me.
你去啊  勾引回来  瞎搅和012---Get in there, man. Flirt back. Mix it up!
人家知道啦012---Yeah, I'm down with that.
好  来喽012---Okay, here it goes.
你012---How...
好012---...you...
吗012---...doing?
有反应了  她挥手要我过去012---It worked! She's waving me over.
我马上过去012---I'll be right over
我看看  她住在三楼012---.Let's see, she's on the third floor...
哇  她真的很美啊  这还用你说012---She is pretty, huh? Tell me about it, huh?
不  不  不  我跟她没关系012---Oh, no, no. No, no! I'm not with her.
她只是摩妮卡012---Oh, that's just Monica.
嘿  乔伊012---Hey, Joey!
我很会演吧012---Great stuff, huh?
这是你家012---This is your place?
当然是  请进  对了012---Yeah, of course it is. Oh, come on in. Ooh, ohh. Uh, 
经过窗户能假装在冲浪012---go by the window. You can pretend to be surfing.
可是我数过啊  这里住的不应该是你012---But I counted. You're not supposed to live here.
要命012---Oh, man!
怎么了012---Unh! What happened?
我最后跑到罗斯家去了  一定是我数错了012---I ended up at Ross' place. I must have miscounted or something.
可恶  她不在了012---Damn! She's not there anymore.
你看  罗斯在演"看电视"那段012---Oh, look, Ross is doing his "watching TV" bit.
不  乔伊  我觉得他真的在看电视012---No, Joe, I think he's just watching TV.
嫌犯已失去踪迹012---We've lost visual contact with the suspect.
好  我现在非走不可了012---Okay, now I really have to go.
这真是太不公平了  有人开枪打店员012---It's so unfair that our date has to get cut short...
我们的约会就得中断012---...just because some guy shot at a store clerk.
亲爱的  我知道  但这是我的工作  好吧  不如我一起去012---I know, but it's my job. Then maybe I could come too?
嫌犯刚从水沟中裸体现身012---Suspect has just emerged naked from the sewer.
好吧  你去就好012---All right, you go.
再见  好  再见012---Bye-bye. Okay. Bye.
天啊  怎么了012---Oh, God! What?
我好想念他012---Oh, I just miss him so much!
才几星期  就这么认真了012---For just a week you guys are really close, huh?
是啊  说来很奇怪  可是我没办法  他真的很体贴012---Yeah, it's weird. I can't help it, though. He's so sweet.
他像是只小狗狗  你知道012---He's like this little puppy dog, you know?
却很强悍  还会开枪打坏人012---But like a really tough one who shoots bad guys.
我最喜欢刚开始恋爱的感觉012---Ugh, I just love the beginning parts of relationships, you know?
彼此难分难舍012---You can't keep your hands off each other.
我知道  热恋是最棒的012---I know. It is the best. Ha, ha. Ha, ha.
你和钱德的热恋持续了多久012---So-so how long did that last for you and Chandler?
什么  我们还在热恋啊012---What? It's still going on.
少来  老实说  何时结束的012---Come on, seriously. When did it end?
我是很老实啊  我们总是黏在一起012---I am serious. We're all over each other all the time.
好吧  你们的事你最清楚  我只是好奇罢了012---Okay, you know where you are better than I do. I was just curious.
菲比  你别发神经了  好不好012---Why don't you just calm down, Phoebe, all right?
先把事实搞清楚  不要逢人便说全天下只有你们在热恋012---Why don't you just get all your facts before you run around telling everybody that you're the only hot couple!!
天啊  睡狮被我吵醒了012---God, I woke the beast. Um...
显然是我错了  我失言012---I was wrong obviously. I just misspoke. It's okay.
没事了  没事了012---Well, it is okay. I mean...
只要你知道我和钱德  也和你们一样012---As long as you know Chandler and I are also hot and fiery.
火热缠绵就好012---I mean, just as hot as you.
我们的欲火012---I mean, our flame...
简直可以燎原012---Whoo! It is on fire!
摩妮卡  扫把还你012---Monica, here's your broom back.
你真可爱012---You are so cute.
喔  嘿  面试顺不顺利012---Oh, hey! How'd the interview go? Ugh!
糟透了  我犯了最蠢最丢人的错误012---Horrible! I did the stupidest, most embarrassing thing.
你跟考官说要跟他老婆上床  然后又从椅子上跌下来了012---Did you tell the guy you wanted to have sex with his wife then fall off your chair?
不是  那是怎么了012---No. So, what happened?
真是糟糕透顶  原本面试都很顺利012---Ugh, it was horrible! And the interview part went so well.
我还把大家逗笑了012---You know, like, I even made him laugh.
考官说到什么船的事012---He said something about a boat...
我回答说 "只要救生衣够多就行"012---...and I was like, "Well, yeah, if you've got enough life jackets."
相信我  当时真的很逗012---Trust me. It was actually very funny.
反正到了最后说再见012---Anyway, so we were saying goodbye and, uh... Ugh.
怎么了啦012---What happened?.
我们当时正要握手012---All right, we were shaking hands..
他缓缓朝我靠过来012---...and he kind of leaned in toward me.
他也许是要帮我开门012---Maybe he was going to open the door.
但是我完全误会了  所以我就012---But I totally misread him and I, uh...
你亲了上去012---You kissed him?
我又没有别的办法012---I didn't know what else to do!
你可以试着012---Well, you could have tried...
别去亲他012---...not kissing him.
钱德  真是多谢你012---Thanks, Chandler.
瑞秋  拉夫罗伦的人来电  要你去第二关面试012---Hey, Rach, a guy from Ralph Lauren called. You got a second interview.
不敢相信  我还能去第二关面试  对啊012---I can't believe it! I got a second interview. Yes!
我看那一吻没那么糟嘛012---That kiss isn't looking like such a mistake now, is it?
慢着  他要我回去面试  不是因为那一吻吧012---Wait a minute, wait. You don't think that's why he wants me back?
是啊012---Yeah!
不是吗012---No?
吻  你们在说什么吻012---Kiss? What are you talking about?
我在面试中  意外地亲了考官012---Ugh, I accidentally kissed him in the interview...
他现在还要我回去012---...and now he wants me back y'know of course...
"把那逢人便亲的女孩带来"012---...because, "Let's bring back the girl who kisses everybody"!
瑞秋  你别乱想了012---Come on, Rach.
天啊  万一他觉得我是那种随便跟他上床的人怎么办012---Oh my God! What if he thinks I'm the kind of girl that'll just sleep with him?
他要你回去面试  或许是因为你适合那工作012---He probably wants you back because you're right for the job.
或许吧  我不知道  天啊  我怎么会那么蠢012---Maybe. I don't know. Oh, God! How could I be so stupid?
瑞秋  快别那么说了  乔伊给你个抱抱就好012---Oh, Rachel, look, don't say that.I think you just need a hug from Joey. Heh.
来  来呀012---Come on. Come on, ha-ha-ha.
她回来了  辣妹回来了012---She's back! Hot girl's back!
还不完全是  但是谢谢你012---Aw, well, I'm not totally back yet. but thank you.
不是说你  是罗斯那栋的辣妹  她回来了012---No, in Ross' building. She's back! She's back!
等一下  我  马上过去012---Okay, wait there. I'll be over in a second.
一  二  三  知道了012---One, two, three. Got it!
我来看看她有多辣012---I gotta check out this hot girl.
辣妹在这里012---There she is!
可恶  你搬家啦012---Damn it! Did you move?
是啊012---Yes.
我跟你们住了一阵子  然后搬到了这里012---I lived with you guys for a while. Then I found this place.
我是罗斯012---I'm Ross.
有什么事012---Yes?
你家里有住辣妹吗012---Do you happen to have a hot girl in there?
没有  我一个人住012---No, I'm all alone.
是啊  我很遗憾012---Yeah. Sorry about that.
小女孩  你好012---Oh. Hey, little girl.
你妈妈  姊姊或是褓姆  有没有谁正好是辣妹012---Is your mommy or sister or babysitter by any chance, a hot girl?
爹地  下次再聊012---Daddy! Later, girl! Aah.
真要命012---Oh, man!
辣妹012---Hot girl?
辣妹012---Hot girl!
嗨  瑞秋  请进  好012---Hi, Rachel. Come on in. Hi. Okay.
很高兴再次见到你  谢谢012---Ahem. It's nice to see you again. Thank you.
瑞秋012---Oh, Rachel, uh...
什么012---What? .
那上面012---Just, uh..
你说什么  我来帮你012---Excuse me? Yeah, let me...
好  我知道是怎么回事了  听着012---Whoa, eh, oh!All right. Okay, I see what's going on here. Now, listen, look...
抱歉让你误会了012---...I am sorry if I gave you the wrong impression.
但我不是那种随便的女孩  为了工作出卖肉体012---But I am not some hussy who will just sleep around to get ahead.
虽然我亲过你  你也没有权利012---Even though I kissed you, that does not give you...
要我跟你上床  这份工作我也没有那么想要012---...the right to demand sex from me! I do not want this job that bad.
再会  先生012---Good day, sir.
说了你们一定不信012---Ugh, you are not gonna believe...
拉夫罗伦的那个杂碎对我做了什么012---...what that sleazeball from Ralph Lauren did to me.
不可思议  你们怎么知道012---Okay, that's amazing. How did you know that?
你嘴唇上沾到墨水012---You got ink on your lip.
喔012---Oh.
改天让我拿拿你的枪如何012---What do you say, maybe, sometime I hold your gun?
不知道  照理说不能那样012---I don't know. We're not supposed to do that.
又不会怎样012---What could happen? I mean...
我看答案是  不行012---Yeah. I'm gonna say no.
菲比  晚餐后要去看电影吗  不行  我们已经有计划了012---Phoebe, do you want to see a movie after dinner tonight? Oh, we can't. We already have plans.
你们要去干嘛012---What are you doing?
就跟每天一样啊  腻在盖瑞的公寓里012---Um, well, same thing we did all day. Just hang out at Gary's apartment.
他好厉害  我们都没离开过卧室012---He is so amazing. We never left the bedroom.
祝你们看电影愉快012---But have fun at the movie.
我们不是要去看电影012---Uh, ha, ha. Well, we're not seeing a movie.
不去  那你干嘛问我们要不要去012---You're not? Why did you ask us if we wanted to go?
我想知道你做什么  是因为012---Oh, um, because I just wanted to know what you were doing...
我怕你不小心闯进我房问  因为我和钱德012---...so y'know walk in on me and Chandler...
会做上一整晚的012---...while we were, y'know,doing it all night.
失陪以下  好吗012---Will you excuse me just a second? Okay. Yeah.
钱德  方便私下说几句话吗  好012---Chandler? Can I see you for a second? Uh, yeah.
我们定要打败他们  为什么012---We have got to beat them! Why?
因为盖瑞和菲比  觉得他们比我们还火热012---Because Gary and Phoebe think they're a hotter couple than we are.
所以呢  所以012---Oh! So? So?
所以我们上楼去大干一场  证明他们是错的012---So! So we've got to go upstairs and have a lot of sex to prove them wrong!
摩妮卡  你别再比来比去了  这真是太疯狂了012---Monica, you have got to stop this competitive thing. It's crazy.
只为了让盖瑞和菲比难看  我们就要上楼大战数十回合012---Just to impress Gary and Phoebe.you want me to go upstairs and have sex over and over.
我干嘛说不  快去拿外套012---...and I'm saying no to this why? Get your coat!
嘿  嗨012---Hey. Hi.
借过012---Excuse me.
你们应该看一看  通知其他的住户012---You should check this out. Tell the other tenants.
这家伙一直在找什么辣妹的012---Apparently, he's running around looking for some kind of hot girl.
谁不是呢012---Who isn't?
我们可能还没见过  我是罗斯012---I don't think we've met. I'm Ross.
我知道  你就是那个不愿意分担工友费的人012---I know. You're the guy who wouldn't chip in for the handyman.
算了012---Never mind.
不  其实我觉得大家的反应不公平012---No, I actually thought it was unfair the way everyone reacted.
因为你才刚搬进来而已嘛012---I mean, you had just moved in.
我是刚搬进来而已012---I had just moved in!
谢谢你012---Thank you!
等等012---Listen, um...
我是珍  珍012---Jen. Jen.
这听来可能有点012---I know this may sound a little:
不如哪天一起喝杯咖啡012---But, uh, would you want to grab a cup of coffee sometime?
当然  没问题012---Sure, that would be nice.
上面有我的电话  打给我012---My number's on there. Give me a call.
我一定打012---I will give you a call. Heh.
那后会有期  好012---I'll see you later. Okay.
我忘记拿报纸了012---I forgot my paper.
刚才真是太棒了012---That was amazing. Ugh.
等到吃晚饭的时候  我一定要说给菲比和盖瑞听012---Phoebe and Gary are so gonna hear about this at dinner.
刚才真是太棒了012---That was amazing.
我们才是热恋第一名012---We are the hottest, huh?
没人比我们更热恋012---No one is hotter than we are.
我们是最棒的  不  最棒的是你012---We're the best. No, you're the best.
不  你才是  不  你才是012---No, you're the best. No, you're the best.
我是最棒的012---I am the best.
两位012---Hey, guys.
你们刚才在干嘛啊012---What you been doing?
嘿  乔伊  那不是前几天  跟你挥手的女孩吗012---Hey, Joey, isn't that the girl who waved at you the other day?
不知道  但你的床单是透明的012---I don't know, but I can see through your sheet.
对  是她  没错012---Yeah. Yeah, that's her.
不过算了吧  我无缘跟她见面  为什么012---But you know what? It doesn't matter.I'm never gonna meet her anyways. Why?
因为我找不到她的公寓012---Because it's impossible to find her apartment!
她就像是住在  辣妹黑洞里012---She lives in some hot-girl parallel universe or something.
你在说什么012---What are you talking about?
她明明就住在二楼  左边数过来第七间012---She lives on the 2nd floor, 7th apartment from the left.
才不是  她住在三楼  左边数过来第八间012---No, no, no, she lives on the 3rd floor, 8th apartment from the left.
才怪  前两个窗户是大厅的012---No. Those first two windows, that's the lobby.
过去那边的是楼梯间窗户  你数错了012---And y'know the other one over there, that's the stairway. You've been counting wrong.
我之前不知道  摩妮卡  谢谢你012---I did not know that! Thank you, Monica.
不敢相信我因为数数  差点就失去了另一个女孩012--- I can't believe，I almost lost another girl because of counting!
你好了吗  好了  我去拿外套  好的012---So, uh, you ready? Yeah, I'll just get my coat. Okay.
你能帮我去开门吗  没问题012---Could you get that? Sure.
乔伊012---Joey...?
不  不012---Aah! No! No!
首先  我要谢谢你  同意再次见我012---Uh, first, I would like to say thank you for agreeing to see me again.
不要紧012---That's, uh, quite all right.
但我有义务告诉你  这次的面试有录影存证012---But I feel obligated to tell you that this meeting is being videotaped.
好  首先我要向你道歉  我不小心亲了你012---Okay. Um.Well, first, I would like to start by apologizing for kissing you...
还有  对你大吼的那件事012---...and, uh, for yelling at you.
很合理012---Fair enough.
你或许还会想要雇用012---Now, you're probably going to hire one of the people who, uh...
不曾  不曾012---Who did... Who did not, um, ahem...
对你大吼或是夺门而出的人012---...yell at you and storm out.
不过那样可就大错特错了  原因是这样的012---And I think that's a big mistake. And here's why.
我大出洋相之后  还敢回来  这说明我有勇气012---I made a huge fool of myself, and I came back. That shows courage.
我以为你要我用性来交换工作  当时我拒绝了012---When I thought you wanted sex in exchange for this job, I said no.
这表示我有骨气012---That shows integrity.
我不害怕挺身为自己辩护012---And I was not afraid to stand up for myself...
这表示我有勇气012---...and that shows courage.
我知道  我已经说过勇气了012---Okay, ahem.Now, I know that I've already said courage...
不过勇气总是多多益善嘛012---...but you've got to have courage.
最后当我以为你  想趁工作之便占我便宜012---And, um, finally when I thought you were making sexual advances in the workplace...
我拒绝了  但是没打算告你012---...I said no, and I was not litigious.
所以你看  我有勇气012---So there you go. You got courage...
有骨气  双重勇气012---...you got integrity, you got courage again...
而且又不告你012---...and not litigious.
您是012---Look, Mr...
塞纳  塞纳  我知道012---Zelner. Zelner! I knew that.
我知道012---I knew that!
我真的很想要这份工作012---I really, really want this job.
我想我一定会做得很好012---And I think I would be really good at it.
这样吧012---You know what?
虽然我可能会后悔012---I may regret this, but, uh...
但我要让你试试看012---...I'm gonna give you a shot.
你要  真的012---Oh, you are? Really?
谢谢你  喔  老天012---Oh, thank you. Oh, God!
我现在抱你会不会很不得体012---Oh, would it be completely inappropriate to give you a hug?
会  那好吧012---Yes. Okay.
握手可以吗012---Well, how about a handshake? Ha-ha-ha.
天啊  对不起012---Aah! Oh, God! I'm sorry!
我不是故意要摸那个的  摸你012---Oh, God, I did not mean to touch that! I mean, you!
我是说  那里012---There! Uh, there. Um...
好吧012---Okay, so, thank you.
那谢谢你  我先离开  非常感谢012---I'm gonna leave. Thank you very much. Thank you so much.
那就星期一见了012---Hey, I'll see you Monday.
钱德  你累了012---You tired Chandler?
今天疯成那样  他不累才怪012---You better believe he's tired, after the day we had!
如果你们懂的话  你们懂吧012---If you know what I mean. Do you know what I mean?
亲爱的  连墨西哥脆片都懂012---Honey? The tortilla chips know what you mean.
钱德  我给你的警徽还喜欢吗012---So, uh, Chandler, do you like that badge I got you?
喜欢  很酷012---Oh, yeah, it's so cool.
宾警官得要先行告退  执行10一100勤务012---Now, I gotta go. Officer Bing's got a 10-100.
去尿尿012---That's pee-pee.
菲比  你头发里有树枝012---Phoebe, you have a twig in your hair.
来这里的路上 我们绕了一点路012---We kind of took a detour on our way over here.
对  我们去公园里散步 看四下无人就012---we took a little stroll in the park and no one was around, so...
不会吧  真的有012---You didn't. We did!
我们违反了犯罪条例  第12条第7款012---Ha, ha. We violated section 12, paragraph 7 of the criminal code.
在公园  是吧012---The park, huh? Ha, ha.
公共场所012---Public place. Uh-huh.
我听到了  失陪一下012---I hear you. Can you excuse me for a second?
嗨  钱德012---Hi, Chandler.
摩妮卡  这是男厕012---Monica, this is the men's room.
没错吧012---Isn't it?
没错012---Yes, it is.
我一直都觉得男厕很性感  你不觉得吗012---But see, I've always found the men's bathroom very sexual. Haven't you?
  不觉得012---No.
否则我们就不会在一起了012---And if I did, I don't think we'd be going out.
得了吧  这越搞越离谱了012---This is getting ridiculous.
别这样  我们不能让他们赢012---Come on, we can't let them win! Uh...
我们已经证明我们在热恋了  为何你走火入魔成这样012---Ugh, we have already proved that we are hot! Okay? So why-why are you getting so obsessed about this thing?!
因为菲比和盖瑞012---Phoebe and Gary are in that
不仅难分难舍  还在公园里做了那档子事012---"can't keep their hands off each other" phase!
所以呢  所以呢012---So? So.
所以我很难过  因为我们激情不再了012---It makes me really sad that we're not really there anymore.
原来是为了这档事012---Oh, is that what this has all been about?
我们成天腻在一起的那时012---Wasn't it a lot more exciting when we were, you know...
不是让人兴奋吗012---...all over each other all the time?
对啊  那时很棒  真的很棒012---Yeah, that was great. That was really great.
但是老实跟你说  我们现在的状况让我更兴奋012---But to tell you the truth, I'm more excited about where we are now.
真的  是啊012---Really? Yeah.
我从没谈过这么久的恋爱012---I've never been in a relationship that's lasted this long before.
过了刚开始的激情期了  还想跟对方相处在一起012---Y'know to get past the beginning and still be around each other all the time, 
我觉得这是很不平凡的012---I think that's pretty incredible.
而且还是和你在一起012---And the fact that this is all happening with you...
这让我很兴奋012---...I think that's pretty exciting.
真甜012---That's so sweet.
我知道我表现得有点过火012---I know that I was acting a little crazy...
但是我的感觉跟你一样  真的012---...but I feel the same way. Mm?
你知道我刚领悟到什么吗012---You know what I just realized?
我们的关系让你惊慌012---You just freaked out about our relationship.
才没有  就是有  承认吧012---Pfft, I did not. Yes, you did!
你很惊慌012---Admit it. You freaked out!
好啦  我是有一点惊慌012---I freaked out a little.
岂止有一点  你超级惊慌的012---A little? You freaked out bigtime, okay?
是我救你的  我们角色互换了012---And I fixed it! We have switched places.
我现在是国王  你是搞砸又发疯的输家012---I am the relationship king, and you are the crazy, irrational screwup!
现在又回到原位了012---And now we're back.
没想到罗斯还真的相信012---I cannot believe Ross is buying this.
谢天谢地  我再也看不下去了012---Thank God. I can't watch him anymore. Ha-ha-ha.
你们准备好去看电影没有  好了012---You guys ready for the movies? Yeah.
对了  多谢你把潘蜜拉和洁丝敏借给我们012---Oh, by the way, thank you for loaning us Pamela and Yasmine.
要命  她们还真是看不腻012---Man, they cannot get enough!
