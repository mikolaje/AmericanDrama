你要我去自动柜员机领吗012---Okay, you want me to stop at the ATM?
不用  到罗斯家里拿就好012---Nah, while you're at Ross's if you see any lying around¡­
什么012---What?
什么  我不做那种事的012---What?! I-I-I don't, I don't do that! 
你逼问那家伙的方式  真是太酷了012---That was so cool, man. The way you leaned on that guy.
天色越来越黑了012---It is starting to get dark out there.
他什么都招了  他对你毫不保留012---He told you everything. I mean you totally cracked him.
对  他是受害者  他们通常话都很多012---Yeah well, being that he was the victim, they're usually pretty talkative.
好  正式进入夜晚了012---Okay, but it is officially nighttime.
盖瑞  要我帮你拿红灯吗012---Oh hey, Gary, want me to grab the berry for ya?

有融化的起司和大蒜蕃茄酱吗012---Does it have melted cheese and marinara sauce?
有  那就不能在我的车上吃012---Yeah, you can't eat that in my car.
好吧012---Yeah, okay.
买这部警车的钱   我缴的税也有一份012---Even though my tax dollars paid for this car.
你缴的税012---Your tax dollars?
好啦  你的钱012---Yeah, okay.
这个三明治还真香012---Wow! That sandwich really does smell good.
我有说你可以闻吗012---Did I say you could smell it?
闻个三明治都不行012---I can't smell your sandwich?
香味就占去了好吃的一半012---Half the taste is in the smell.
你把好吃的都吸光了012---You-you're sucking up all the tastiness!
好吧  还给你012---Okay, I'll give them back.
这三明治到底棒在哪里012---Look! What is so great about that sandwich?

什么事012---Hey! What's up?
我做玛格莉特还缺材料012---I need a few more things to make the margaritas.
我要盐  玛格莉特调汁  还有龙舌兰酒012---Uhh, I need some salt, some margarita mix, and tequila.
我们家里只有冰块啊012---So all we have is ice?
看看他有没有冰块012---See if he has ice.
好吧012---Okay.
喂  罗斯  我是艾蜜莉012---Hello Ross? It's Emily.
我知道这很突然012---I know this is out of the blue
但是我明天就要结婚了012---but uh, I'm getting married tomorrow.
或许啦  我一直在想你012---Well, maybe I am. I keep thinking about you
不知道我们匆忙地放弃对方  是不是一个错误012---and I'm wondering if-if we made a mistake giving up so fast.
你有在想我吗012---Are you thinking about me?
一定没有012---Of course you're not.
如果有的话  今晚打给我012---But if you are, call me tonight.
好吧  再见012---Okay, bye.
下一站是哪里012---So where are we going next?
这个目击证人不回我电话  我们去他家堵他012---This witness won't return my calls so we're gonna see if we can surprise him coming home.
去堵他  他不会生气吧012---Surprise him? We're not gonna make anybody mad, are we?
得了吧你012---Come on, man.
那你会在那贼人的律师出现前  先从他身上挤出一些汁来012---Listen so uh, are you gonna squeeze the perps shoes a little bit before he lawyers up?
那是目击证人  不是贼人  而且没有人会那样说话012---He's a witness, not a perp. And no one talks like that.
是啊  没人会那样说话012---Yeah. No one talks like that.
难道你是警察012---Oh, what, like you're Mr. Cop?
我比你们两个都像警察012---I'm more cop than you two.
这是什么道理012---How do you figure that?
醒醒吧  我坐在前座012---Hello! I'm in the front seat,  okay?
我是盖瑞的搭档012---I'm Gary's partner.
你说搭档的时候不像警察  倒像是同志012---Y'know, When you say "partner," it doesn't sound cop.It sounds gay.
爱吃醋012---Um, jealous.
麻烦  别张扬  我们这是秘密出勤012---Hey, do you mind? We're under cover here.
好  没问题012---Oh, yeah. No problem
罗斯  抱歉012---Ross. Sorry. Sorry! Oh, 
好了012---There.
盖瑞  我是谁012---Hey, Gary. Who am I?
打电话回家012---Phone home.
看看这位罗斯警官  被打入后座了012---Look at Officer Ross riding back here with the visitors.
是啊  这是怎么一回事呢012---Yeah, What's up with that, Serpico?
你有在想我吗012---Are you thinking about me?.
一定没有012---No, of course you're not
如果有的话  今晚打给我012---But if you are, call me tonight.
好吧  再见012---Okay, bye.
不会吧012---No.
我知道012---I know.
幸好先被你听到了  我们一定要把这留言洗掉012---Well thank God you were here!  We have to erase that.
什么  我们不能那样012---What? We can't do that.
非这样不可012---We have to.
万一罗斯听到了  回电给她  他们又会合了怎么办012---what if Ross's hears that and then calls her back and then they get back together?
你希望那样吗012---Is that what you want?
看到罗斯跟那个控制欲超强  神经兮兮的疯子艾蜜莉复合012---Ross back with that controlling, neurotic, crazy Emily?
那个不让罗斯见你的艾蜜莉012---The Emily that wouldn't let him see you?
不行  万万不可012---No. Oh, no, no.God, no.
绝对不能和她复合012---He should not get back with her.
你知  我知  就连罗斯都知道012---I know that, you know that. Even Ross knows that.
但我们还是没有权力  擅自洗掉给罗斯的留言012---But that still doesn’t give us the right to erase his message!
我可是他的妹妹012---I'm his sister. okay? 
我爱他  不想看他受到伤害012---and I love him. I don't want to see him get hurt.
得了  我这样还没有权控制012---Come on! Doesn't that give me the right to control him...
帮助他吗012---Help him?
我觉得需要帮忙的不是他012---I don't think he's the one who needs help.
艾蜜莉非常不稳定012---No, look, she's obviously unstable, okay?
她竟然想在结婚当天落跑012---I mean she's thinking about running out on her wedding day.
好啦  但你看看  她让罗斯陷入了什么处境012---Okay, fine! But I mean, look at the position she's putting him in!
你要罗斯怎么办012---What's he gonna do?
难道让罗斯在艾蜜莉结婚当天  跑去破坏婚礼012---Ross is gonna run over there on the wedding day and break up the marriage?!
谁做得出那种事012---I mean, who would do that?!
好啦  不过这是两码子事012---Okay, fine. All right. but that's y'know, it's different! 
虽然有很多人都是重复的012---Although it did involve a lot of the same people.
艾蜜莉显然想用变态的笑话  来恶整罗斯012---Y'know what, this is obviously some kind of twisted joke she's trying to play on him.
够了  你疯了012---Okay, you are crazy!
她听起来真的很沮丧012---I'm sorry, but she sounded generally upset!
你听听就知道012---I mean, listen!
您的留官已经删除012---Your messages have been erased.
不会吧012---Noooooooo!
好  我们很安全  对吧  不可能会有厄运降临012---Okay, y'know, we-we're safe right? I mean nothing bad can go down!
对  不过我倒想起来了  签一下这个012---No. But that reminds me. Sign this.
这是什么012---What is it?
没什么  只是断腿或脑袋开花  也不能告到市政府头上012---Oh it's nothing, it just says that you can't sue the city if you scrap your knee or y'know, get your head blown off.
快点喔  我要签012---Oh, hurry up. I want to sign that.
好  他来了012---Okay, Here he comes.
他在干嘛  搞什么鬼啊012---What is he doing? What the hell is he doing?
什么   怎么了012---What? What? What? What is it?
没事吧  发生什么事012---Is everything okay? What's going on?
他看到我们了  别动  不要看他012---Okay, he sees us. Now don't move. Don't look at him.
没事的  只是车子熄火了012---Hey, it's okay. It was just a car backfire.
看看  你想用身体掩护朋友012---Hey, look at that. You tried to save your buddy.
看到没有  他冒死拯救朋友012---You see that? You see what he did?
你没事吧012---You okay, man?
乔伊  谢了012---Uh-huh. Thanks, Joey.
那我呢012---Uh... Hello?
嗨012---Hi.
我们应该走了012---All right, I guess we should go.
不  等等012---No, wait. wait.
喔  对了012---Oh, yeah. Right.
不是啦  摩妮卡012---No. Monica.
摩妮卡  我们得补救这个012---Monica, we have to fix this.
我们无能为力啊  你已经把留言删掉了012---There's nothing we can do. You erased the message!
我可以老实跟他说啊012---Yeah well unless we tell him.
如果你想要这么明理的话  我也争不过你012---Well, if you're gonna be totally rational about this, I can't argue with you!
好啦  你要说就说  我不想介入012---All right? Fine, if you wanna tell him, tell him. I just don't want to be a part of it.
或许又是艾蜜莉打来的  她想说一样的话012---Oh, maybe that's Emily calling back to leave the exact same message.
嘿  罗斯  是你啊  我只是要你记得这种感觉012---Hey Ross! It's you! I just want you to remember this feeling.
活着是一种幸运012---You are lucky to be alive.
所以每一天都要活得精彩012---So live every day to the fullest.
珍爱自己  好吗012---Love yourself, okay?
好吧  也别忘了买邮票  再见012---Oh, and also get stamps. Bye!
哇  只要把这留言放给艾蜜莉听  所有的问题就都解决了012---Wow! Play that message for Emily, and this problem goes away.
可不是吗012---Right?
谁要来见见英雄012---Hey, anybody want to meet a hero?
约翰葛林来了012---John Glenn is here?
不  是乔伊012---No. Joey.
菲比  今晚真是太不可思议了012---Pheebs, We had the most incredible night. Okay,
我们在警车里   慢着012---so, we're in the car... Wait. Hold on.
嗨  嗨012---Hi. Hi.
好  继续说012---Okay, go ahead.
好  我们在警车里  012---Okay, okay, So we're in the car, Right?
突然"砰"一声  有人开枪012---And bang! A shot was fired.
乔伊完全不顾自己的安危  扑到我身上保护我012---And Joey with no regard for his own safety throws himself on me!
天啊  乔伊012---My God, Joey!
那是汽车熄火放屁的声音012---It was a car backfire.
对  但是当时他并不知道  对  我不知道012---Yeah, But he didn't know that.Yeah, I didn't know that.
那很有可能是子弹012---And it could've just as easily have been a bullet.
乔伊  有没有想过要当警察   警界很需要你这种人012---Hey Joe, you ever think about joining the force? We could use a guy like you.
听到巨响就吓得跳起来012---Who jumps at loud noises.
我今晚有可能丧命的012---Wow. I could have died tonight.
对  如果那部放屁的车  把你碾过去的话012---Yeah! If the car that backfired had run over you.
我先回家去了  省得罗斯大谈人生新发现012---I think I'll go home before Ross starts rambling about his newfound respect for life.
我的人生的确有了新发现012---I do have a newfound respect for life.
天啊012---Oh, my God.
你要吃晚餐吗012---So you wanna get some dinner?
好啊  当然012---Yeah, sure.
你知道吗  若现在听到枪声  我一定会扑倒你身上012---Oh, y'know what? If I heard a shot right now, I'd throw my body on you.
是吗  那我们或许应该  去穷山恶极的社区散步012---Oh yeah? Well maybe you and I should take a walk through a bad neighborhood.
好啊012---Okay.
再见  再见012---Bye. Bye.
罗斯  你别再闹了012---Cut it out Ross!
我不想在同一天里  先是救你然后又痛扁你一顿012---I hate to have to save your life and kick your ass in the same day!
兄弟012---Dude.
你刚才怎么先闪了012---How come you took off?
我只是去散步  在客厅里绕来绕去012---Oh, I just went for a walk, around the living room. Whatever¡­
有什么不对吗012---Is something wrong?
没有  我只是累了  走路走累了012---No. No, I'm just tired.Y'know, from-from the walk.
好吧  你扑上去救罗斯012---Okay. You dove in front of Ross! Ross!
罗斯012---Ross.
原来是这么一回事012---That's what this is about.
天啊  你恨罗斯012---Oh, my God. You hate Ross.
我没有恨罗斯  你当然有012---I don't hate Ross. Of course you do.
我救了他  你生我的气  这样全都说得通了012---I saved him. You're mad at me. It all adds up.
你想铲除罗斯  铲除什么012---You want Ross out of the picture. What picture?
不知道  但是你说的话很吓人012---I don't know. But I don't like what I'm hearing.
我很高兴你在汽车放屁事件中  救了罗斯一命012---Look I'm very glad that you saved Ross from the car backfire,
但那如果真的是子弹怎么办  你竟然救他不救我012---but y'know, it could've been a bullet and you y'know, you didn't try to save me!
原来你是在气这个  你以为我觉得罗斯比你重要012---Ohh, you're upset because you think I chose Ross over you.
不是这样的   我知道你能照顾自己012---No, I knew you could take care of yourself.
罗斯需要别人帮忙  他不像你我见过大场面012---You know? I mean, Ross needs help. He's not "street" like us.
话说到头  你宁愿先去救罗斯  也不来救我012---When it comes down to it, you would risk your life for Ross before you would for me.
这才是重点012---That's the bottom line.
不完全是这样012---Well, no, not exactly! 
其实我那不是要救罗斯012---All right, look, I, I wasn't trying to save Ross.
好吗012---Okay?
我的三明治在罗斯旁边012---My sandwich was next to Ross.
真的012---All right?
我是要救我的三明治012---I was, I was trying to save my sandwich.
怕它被枪打到012---From a bullet?
我知道这么说  像是没啥道理012---I know it doesn't make much sense.
岂止没啥道理012---"Much" sense?
钱德  那是本能反应  我就扑过去了012---Look Chandler, it was instinct. Okay? I just went for it!
所以你冒死  去救三明治012---So you risked your life, for a sandwich!
我知道这听起来很夸张012---I know it sounds crazy...
但是  钱德  这可是世界上最棒的三明治012---...but Chandler this is the greatest sandwich in the world.
所以你并不觉得罗斯比我重要012---So you didn't uh, choose Ross before me.
才不  我绝对不会那样012---No. I would never do that.
你就像是我的亲兄弟012---You're like my brother.
真的  对  为了证明你对我的意义012---Really?  Yeah. In fact, to prove how much you mean to me...
给你012---Here.
谢了  轻点啊  这不是热狗012---Thanks. No, eh, oh-oi, easy, it's not a hot dog!
是不是很好吃012---How good is that?
看吧012---See?
慢着  你在干嘛012---Oh-whoa-hey, dude, What are you doing?
你不是要证明我对你的意义012---I thought you were showing me how much you mean to me.
是啊  用一口来证明012---Yeah. With a bite!
你也帮帮忙012---Gee-e-e-eez!
嗨012---Hi.
瑞秋  你在这里干嘛012---Rach, what uh, what are you doing here?
别动不动就往我们公寓跑  我这只是小巫见大巫而已012---Hey, you know what? You are in our apartment all the time.Okay? This is, this is just a drop in the bucket mister!
没关系啦  重点是你来了012---It doesn't matter. The important thing is that you're here.
你是我朋友  而你来到了这里012---You're my friend and you're here.
好  我有一点点害怕  罗斯  你是怎么了012---Okay, just a little scared. What's going on Ross?
今晚发生了最不寻常的事012---The most amazing thing happened tonight.
我还以为自己要去见阎王了012---I thought my number was up.
我真正面临到了濒死的经历012---I had an actual near-death experience.
什么  什么  怎么回事012---What?! What? What happened?!
好  我们不是跟盖瑞坐警车兜风吗012---Okay, okay, we were on the ride along with Gary, right? 
有人朝着我开枪012---and somebody took a shot at me.
真的吗012---Really?
不是  是车子放屁012---No. A car backfired.
但是  我当时以为是有人对我开枪012---But I thought somebody was taking a shot at me.
瑞秋  我劫后余生012---And, Rach...I survived.
我的人生拥有了全新视野012---And I was filled with this great respect for life.
我要真切体验每一刻012---Y'know? I-I want to experience every moment.
我要把握每一个机会012---I want to seize every opportunity.
现在的一切都变得好清晰012---I-I am seeing everything so-so clearly now.
全都是因为汽车放屁012---Because a car backfired?
好吧  你来这里干嘛012---Okay. Why are you here?
我不知道这件事符不符合  你所谓的〝把握每一个机会〞012---Well, I-I-I don't know how this fits into your whole "seizing" thing...
不过艾蜜莉今天打电话给你012---...but Emily called you today.
你跟她说了话  没有  她在你电话里留言012---You talked to her? No, She left a message.
不过留言被删掉了012---But it kind of got erased.
我是说  你的答录机有问题012---I mean,  There's just ... something wrong with your machine.
那她说了什么012---Well, okay, what-what did she say?
说什么对结婚的事有点反悔012---Well,something about having second thoughts about the wedding.
说你们分手是个错误012---And did you guys make a mistake breaking up?
她要你回电012---And she wants you to call her.
现在  我跟你说这件事很对吧012---Now, that-that was a good thing that I told you, right?
是啊  当然是这样012---Yeah. Yes. Of course.
好  谢谢你012---Okay, thank you. Thank you.
我要去跟摩妮卡说  我这样做是对的012---Because...I'm gonna tell Monica I was right.
因为你知道吗  她不希望  那不重要012---Because y'know what?  she didn't want...Not important.
重点是  我是对的  你自己决定012---Point is, I was right. Your decision.
好  我是对的  你自己决定要不要回电012---Okay? I was right. Your decision.
对012---Right.
我猜我应该回电给艾蜜莉012---I guess I should call Emily.
不对  你的决定不对012---No, that's not the right decision.
罗斯  你清醒一点012---That's not right. Ross, come on.
那个女人把你给整惨了012---I mean, that woman made you miserable!
罗斯  你真的想要再来一次012---Okay, Ross? Do you really want to get back into that?
如果她是在昨天打来的  我压根不会想回电012---Okay, look. Yesterday...I wouldn't have even considered calling her back.
但在我面对濒死经历的同一天  我的前妻正好打电话来012---But my ex-wife calls on the same day...I have a near-death experience?
这一定有所含意吧012---I mean, that-that has got to mean something!
罗斯  那不是濒死经历  就连经验都谈不上012---That was not a near-death experience. That was barely an experience.
当时你并不在场012---You weren't there.
或许这就是我应该把握的事012--- Okay, Maybe this is something that I'm supposed to seize, you know?
好吧  你知道吗012---Okay. You know what?
或许这无关把握或是不把握012---Maybe this is not about seizing stuff.
或许这是关于逃避012---Maybe this is about escaping stuff.
就拿今天来说  你逃过了012---Okay? Look at today.I mean, you escaped...
死亡012---...death.
或许这是你逃避的机会  不去和艾蜜莉复合012---y'know? And maybe this is a chance for you to escape getting back together with Emily.
这还蛮有道理的012---That does make sense.
因为我要把握住这个机会012---Because I do want to seize some opportunity...
但是我真的不想她见面或联络012---...but I really don't want to see or talk to her.
这不就结了012---Well, there you go.
或许今天只是〝千钧一发〞日012---Yeah, maybe today's just close-call day.
嘿  瑞秋  谢了012---Hey, thanks, Rach.
亲爱的  甭客气012---Oh, honey. No problem.
等等   留言灯在闪呢012---Oh wait-wait-wait! The message is blinking.
或许留言没被删掉012---Maybe you didn't erase it.
罗斯  是你啊012---Hey, Ross, it's you...
这是旧的留言012---Oh yeah, no that's-that's an old message,
没什么好听的  没错012---Nobody needs to hear that. No.
摩妮卡有来过吗  有啊012---Hey, um, was Monica here? Yeah.
要她把我的钱还来012---I want my money back.
是要用来买邮票的吧012---Yeah, uh You probably need that for stamps, right?
菲比  盖瑞有真的中枪过吗012---Hey, Pheebs? Has Gary ever been shot at for real?
有  一次012---Yes, once.
小小的一次012---Yeah, a little. 
算是他自己打的  这故事没什么好讲的012---He kind of did it to himself. It's not really a good story.
不知道我置身战火会怎样012---I wonder how I'd react under fire.y'know?
不是汽车放屁  是枪林弹雨012---And not backfire...but-but heavy fire, 
好比我在战场上之类的012---like I was in a war or something.
我去打仗一定很厉害012---Man, I would be great in a war.
一定会是很棒的军事领袖012---I mean, I really, I think I'd make a fantastic military leader.
跟你们这些人比起来  我一定会最先当上将军012---I mean, I know I'd make general before any of you guys.
在你被自己的部下枪杀前还是之后啊012---Before or after you were shot by your own troops?
我知道乔伊会在哪里012---I know where Joey would be.
他一定会在散兵坑里保护大家012---He would be down in the foxhole protecting all of us.
对  如果那个散兵坑  是用三明治围起来的话012---Yes, if the foxhole was lined with sandwiches.
没错  英雄三明治012---Yeah, hero sandwiches.
你们知道我主张和平  我对什么战争都没兴趣012---Well you all know I'm a pacifist, so I'm not interested in war in any way.
不过等到革命的那一天来临  我一定要把你们消灭光光012---But y'know what? when the revolution comes, I'll have to destroy you all.
乔伊  你例外012---Not you, Joey.
