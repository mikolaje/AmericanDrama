太好了  再见012---Okay, great. Bye.
猜猜谁要来吃感恩节晚餐012---So guess who's coming to Thanksgiving dinner.
薛尼鲍迪012---Sidney Poitier? Ha, ha.
我怀念瑞秋012---I miss Rachel.
不  是我爸妈012---No, my parents.
太好了  我搬进来之后  他们还没来过012---Oh, That’s great, they haven't seen the place since I moved in.
对  要是你能不提同居的事  就太好了012---Yeah, and y'know, if you could not mention that we live together, that'd be great.
我打算四点左右开动012---I was thinking we'd eat around 4.
为什么不能提同居的事012---Why can't I tell them we live together?
因为他们不知道我们在交往  要在厨房吃吗012---Because they don't know we're dating. Do you think we should eat in the kitchen? 
你为什么没有告诉他们012---Why haven't you told them?
我本来要说  真的012---Um, well, I was going to. I really was.
但是后来不知怎的  就没说了012---But, urn, then somewhere, just out of nowhere, I didn't.
你为什么没说   他们会不开心吗012---Why haven't you told them? Wouldn't they be happy?
四点左右厨房开动   到时候见012---So, dinner in the kitchen around 4. I'll see you then.
他们为什么会不开心012---Why wouldn't they be happy?
因为012---Well, um, because...
主要是012---...mainly, um...
他们不喜欢你012---...they don't like you.
对不起  什么   为什么012---I'm sorry. What? Why? Why?
也许是因为你以前很冷漠012---Maybe because you used to be aloof...
很尖酸刻薄   老爱开玩笑012---...or that you're really sarcastic or that you joke around all the time...
或许是因为你脱了衣服喜欢乱丢012---...or that you take off your clothes and throw them on the couch.
这是他们的还是你的看法012---Is this why they don't like me or why you don't like me?
我知道我应该告诉他们  我不该在意他们012---I know I should have told them. I know I shouldn't care what they think.
对不起012---I'm sorry.
其实没关系   等他们来了  我会表现得很迷人012---You know, it'll be okay, because when they come over, I will be charming.
我会让他们爱上我   然后我们再说012---I will make them love me, then we'll tell them.
你真的觉得可行012---You really think that'll work?
我也可以很有魅力  我不就赢得了你的心012---Hey, I can be pretty charming, babe. I won you over, didn't I?
你应该不会把他们灌得那么醉吧012---I don't think you'll ever get my parents that drunk.
老友记  第六季  第9集  感恩的季节012---Friends  S06E09  The One Where Ross Got High
嘿  太好了  罗斯  你爸妈喜欢我  对吧012---Hey. Oh, good, Ross. Your parents like me, right?
他们当然喜欢你012---Yes, of course they like you.
摩妮卡说他们不喜欢我012---Monica told me they don't.
对  他们不喜欢你012---Yeah, they don't like you.
你知道原因吗012---Do you know why?
也许是因为你很尖酸刻薄  或者是因为012---Maybe it's because you're really sarcastic, or maybe it's because you--
不知道就不要乱猜012---If people don't know, they shouldn't just guess.
帅啊  又一个不值得感恩的感恩节012---This is great, Another Thanksgiving with nothing to give thanks for.
也许我可以感恩你闭嘴012---Maybe I could give thanks for you shutting up, huh?
也许我也可以感恩  你把我的电动送到我的新家012---Maybe I give thanks by taking my PlayStation to my new apartment.
也许我爱你012---Maybe I love you.
嗨  嗨012---Hi. Hi.
你们好012---Hey, guys.
不要  我不想打电动  乔伊012---No, I don't want to play video games, Joey.
你们要去钱德家过感恩节吗012---Are you guys going to Chandler's for Thanksgiving?
对  怎么了012---Yeah, why, what's up?
我和几个舞者朋友想一起庆祝012---Well, me and my dancer friends are thinking of doing Thanksgiving uptown.
我想说你们可能想去012---I thought you guys might like to come.
真的去012---For real?
你们是该去钱德家  我们没有人会做菜012---No, but you should go to Chandler's. Because none of us knows how to cook,
最后八成都在喝酒012---We'll probably just drink all day.
我们去  好012---We go to yours. Yeah.
对  我们得过去露个面  毕竟她是我妹妹012---Yeah, see, we have to stop across the hall because it's my sister.
不过有个妹妹是好事啊012---But, you know, actually, uh, growing up with a sister was nice...
让我很了解女人心012---...because it really helped me understand women.
你应该告诉你的朋友们012---Yeah, you should tell your friends that.
好012---0Kay.
真不知道你怎么能骗到三个老婆012---How you got three women to marry you, I'll never know.
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
菲比  你看  感恩节甜点012---Pheebs, check it out. For my dessert...
我决定做酒果酱松糕012---...I have chosen to make a traditional English trifle.
听起来好棒   摩妮卡你的呢012---Wow, that sounds great. And what are you making, Monica?
万一瑞秋的甜点  好吃的被我吃光光012---In case Rachel's dessert is so good that I eat all of it...
别人会没有吃的了012---...and there's none left for anybody else.
我不做012---Nothing.
你不做012---Nothing?
对  我信任你012---No, sweetie. I trust you.
所以要是我搞砸了  就没有甜点了012---So if I mess this up, there's nothing else for dessert?
你不会搞砸的012---You're not gonna mess it up.
摩妮卡  我好高兴  你真的对我有信心  谢谢012---Wow, Monica, I love that. You really have faith in me. Thank you.
技术问题  这些奶油什么时候好012---Technical question: How do you know when the butter is done?
两分钟前  大约变成这样012---Well, it's done about two minutes before it looks like that.
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
菜闻起来好香  这里布置得真漂亮012---Oh. The food smells great, Mon. And the place looks so nice.
感恩节快乐  感恩节快乐012---Hey, happy Thanksgiving, everybody. Happy Thanksgiving.
感恩节快乐012---Happy Thanksgiving.
真是开心  再见012---Well, this has been great. See you.
你们要去哪里012---Where you going? Oh, oh.
我们说过  要去参加乔伊的室友的聚会012---We did say we'd stop by this little thing Joey's roommate is having.
火辣舞者吉宁012---Oh, Janine, the really hot dancer girl?
有些人会说她很有魅力012---Some would say she's attractive, yes.
还有谁会去012---Who else is going to be there?
她的几个朋友   全是舞者朋友012---Uh, some of her friends. Her dancer friends?
对啦  好不好012---Yes. All right?
她的性感舞者朋友都会去的012---All of her hot dancer friends are gonna be there...
她们会喝酒跳舞  我们真的很想去012---...and they'll be drinking and dancing and we really want to go.
都快成功了012---Dude, we were good.
你们哪儿也不准去  你们说要来吃饭就别想跑012---You're not gonna go anywhere, You said you'd eat here and you'll eat here.
扔下我们去看性感舞者012---Yeah, and leaving us to go see hot dancer girls...
就是不太感恩的012---...is not very Thanksgiving-y.
但是012---Oh, but it is.
第一个感恩节就是这样  印地安人和清教徒共进晚餐012---Uh, it's like the first Thanksgiving when the Indians and Pilgrims sat down.
对  然后印地安人告诉清教徒012---Yeah, and then the Indians taught the Pilgrims...
新世界的性感定义是什么012---...what it meant to be hot in the New World.
大家好  嗨012---Hello, everybody. Hi.
爸  妈012---Hi, Dad. Morn.
看  这谁啊  钱德啊012---Look. Look who it is. It's Chandler.
当然了  钱德  你好012---Oh, yes, of course. Hello, Chandler.
伯父  伯母  你们的气色真好012---Mr. and Mrs. Geller, you look wonderful.
欢迎  外套给我们吧012---It is great to have you here. Let us take your coats.
外面在下雪吗012---Whoa, it snowing out there?
没有012---No.
摩妮卡  菜看起来都好棒啊012---Monica, all this food looks wonderful.
你应该考虑走这一行012---You should think about doing this for a living.
就算我有头皮屑  你也不必指着我笑012---Okay, I have dandruff. There's no need to laugh and point.
爸  钱德是在笑你的笑话012---Dad, Chandler was laughing at yourjoke.
我的笑话又不好笑012---My joke wasn't funny.
瑞秋  我刚刚想到012---Rach, I just remembered.
我昨晚梦到盖勒先生012---I had a dream about Mr. Geller last night.
真的吗012---Really?
对  我梦到他把我从火场救出012---Yeah. I dreamt that he saved me from a burning building...
他好英勇好强壮012---...and he was so brave and so strong.
我对他完全改变了看法012---And it's making me look at him totally differently.
他以前只是 "杰克盖勒  摩妮卡和罗斯的爸爸"012---You know, I mean, he used to be just "Jack Geller, Monica and Ross' dad."
现在他是 "杰克盖勒  梦中情人"012---Now he's "Jack Geller, dream hunk."
不知道  对我来说他永远都是杰克盖勒012---I don't know. To me, he'll always be "Jack Geller...
在你换衣服时闯进来012---...walks in while you're changing."
爸  钱德是罗斯最要好的朋友之一012---You know, Dad, Chandler is one of Ross' very best friends.
罗斯是个好青年012---Ross sure is a great guy.
我一直觉得儿子012---You know, I've always felt that how a young man turns out...
是父亲的翻版012---...is a reflection on his father.
我也有同感   请问你爸是做什么的012---I always thought that too. Tell me, what does your father do?
他是同志歌舞秀012---He's a headliner of a...
的头牌012---...gay burlesque show.
瑞秋  你急死人了  快上甜点啦012---Rash, you're killing us. Will you serve the dessert already?
酒醉的舞者都在等我们012---There's drunken dancers a-waiting.
你们看  很漂亮吧012---Look at it. Isn't it beautiful?
是啊  这是什么012---Yeah. What is it?
酒果酱松糕  有很多层012---It's a trifle. It's got all these layers.
先是一层小松糕   然后是果酱012---First there's a layer of ladyfingers, then a layer of jam...
然后是我自己做的乳蛋糕012---...then custard, which I made from scratch...
然后是覆盖盆子  然后又是小松糕012---...then raspberries, more ladyfingers...
然后是豌豆洋葱炒嫩牛肉012---...then beef sauteed with peas and onions...
然后又有一点乳蛋糕012---...then a little bit more custard...
然后是香蕉   最后再涂上鲜奶油012---...then bananas and then I put whipped cream on top.
香蕉前面是什么012---What was the one right before bananas?
炒牛肉吗  我也觉得有点奇怪012---The beef. Yeah, that was weird to me too.
不过我想说  "连甜肉馅饼都有了"012---But then, y'know, I thought, "Well, there's minced meat pie."
那是一种英式甜点012---That's an English dessert.
英国人都放一堆怪东西012---These people just put very strange things in their food.
对了  可以跟你借兰姆酒吗012---By the way, can I borrow rum from your place?
当然可以012---Yeah, sure.
我不在的时候你们可别偷吃012---And while I'm gone, don't you boys sneak a taste.
好  好012---okay. okay
甜点加牛肉012---Beef in a dessert?
不  不  不可能的012---No, no, no. There is no way.
就是啊  而且果酱才一层012---I know. And only one layer of jam?
有没有搞错012---What is up with that?
天哪  这012---Oh, my God.
两页黏在一起了  钱德012---The pages are stuck together. Chandler.
天哪  她做了酒果酱松糕加012---Oh, my God. She made half an English trifle and...
肉馅马铃薯泥饼012---...half a shepherd's pie.
完了  她得重做了012---Man, now she's gonna start all over.
我们没办法带那些辣妹  认识新世界了012---We're never gonna get to introduce the hot girls to the New World.
不  我们可以  不要告诉她就是了012---No, no, we will. We just won't tell her she messed up.
然后让她上那个牛肉乳蛋糕012---Just let her serve the beef-custard thing?
对  这会是一个有趣的感恩节回忆012---Yeah. It'll be like a funny Thanksgiving story.
呕吐的回忆  的确很有趣012---Vomiting stories are funny, I guess.
乔伊  天哪  你家热死了012---Joey. God, your apartment is like a hundred degrees.
你会不会想脱到只剩下内衣012---Did it make you want to walk around in your underwear?
不会012---No.
还不够热012---Still not hot enough.
瑞秋  怎样  你看他012---Rachel. Okay, look at him.
你看那双有力的手012---Look at those strong hands.
我真想当那瓶…炼乳012---Oh, what I wouldn't give to be that can of condensed milk.
妈  钱德说你的毛衣很好看012---Mom, uh, Chandler was just saying how beautiful your sweater is.
谢谢你  这是新衣服012---Oh, thank you, Chandler. I just bought it.
是吗  很漂亮  米色的  很紧012---Oh. Yes, well, it's very beautiful and it's cream-colored and tight and...
我不是指很紧  不会很紧  我没有在看012---I don't mean tight. It's not too tight. Not that I was looking at...
他是怎么搞的012---What's the matter with him?
大概又嗑药了012---I think he's stoned again.
什么  什么012---What? What?
我有事要告诉你012---Dude, I need to talk to you a sec.
我大概知道  我爸妈为什么不喜欢你了012---Okay, I think I might know why my parents don't like you.
是吗  为什么  记不记得我们年轻的时候012---You do? Why? Okay, remember we were young. Heh.
大二的春假  我在房间里吸麻012---Spring break, sophomore year, I got high in my bedroom...
我爸妈走进来闻到了012---...and my parents walked in and smelled it...
于是我就说你吸了麻   跳窗走了012---...so I told them that you had gotten stoned and jumped out the window.
什么  你为什么要赖给我012---What? Why did you do that?
我不知道  我第一个想到你012---I don't know. Uh, yours was the first name that popped into my head.
对不起  我以为不会怎样012---I'm sorry. I didn't think it'd matter.
怎么可能不会怎样012---How could it not matter?
我怎么知道我们会变成死党012---How was I to know we'd be friends after college...
更别提你会跟我妹同居012---...let alone you'd be living with my sister?
那些 "生死之交"的豪语呢012---What about all that "friends forever" stuff?
不晓得  我当时正嗨012---I don't know. I was all high.
爸妈叫我来看看  你是不是想找罗斯嗑药012---Mom and Dad just sent me to find out if you were trying to get Ross stoned.
罗斯大学吸麻被他们逮到  他居然赖给我012---Your parents caught Ross smoking pot in college, and he blamed it on me.
罗斯  你怎么能这样012---Ross, I can't believe you'd do that.
他们讨厌我  我们才没公开  麻烦你搞定012---We haven't told them we're together because they hate me, okay? So you fix this.
好啦  我会说吸麻的不是钱德012---Okay, okay, I'll tell them it wasn't Chandler who got high.
那我要说是谁呢012---Now, who should I say it was?
你  这又没什么  你现在又没有嗑药012---You. It's not like it's a big deal. You don't still do it or anything.
好啦  好啦  那我要说是谁骗我这么做的012---All right. Now, who should I say tricked me into doing it?
爸012---Dad.
请别在这里剔牙012---Dad, please don't pick your teeth out here.
如果你要翘脚  怎么不坐   摩妮卡  不要烦他012---And if you're gonna put your feet up-Monica, leave him alone.
你快点  好吗012---Will you hurry up?
你之前没听到我说  吉宁的朋友都是舞者吗012---Did you not hear me when I told you that all of Janine's friends are dancers?
而且她们会喝很多酒012---Huh? And that they're gonna be drinking a lot?
我是听到了  不过你再说一次  好浪漫012---No, I did. But tell me again because it's so romantic.
你打得好慢  不能快一点吗012---You're whipping so slow. Can't you do it any faster?
乔伊  我不想犯错012---Joey, come on, I don't want to make any mistakes.
甜点只有这一道   要是我搞砸   大家会说012---This is the only dessert. If I screw it up, everybody's gonna be like:
"记得那次感恩节  瑞秋把酒果酱松糕做坏了"012---"Oh, remember that Thanksgiving when Rachel screwed up the trifle?"
所以让我来做  你只管担心吃的部分012---So just let me worry about making the trifle and you just worry about eating it.alright?
我是很担心012---Oh, I am.
罗斯  你再不说  我就要说了  好啦012---Ross, if you don't tell them, then I will. Okay. Fine.
罗斯  你可以来一下吗012---Ross, can I talk to you for a second? Oh, uh...
等一下好吗   乔伊  我有事要告诉我爸吗012---Can it wait a second, Joey? I have to tell my parents something.
不能等  好吧012---No, it can't? Okay.
我觉得我们应该告诉瑞秋  她甜点做错了012---Okay, look, I think we have to tell Rachel she messed up her dessert.
什么  大家都是怎么了012---What? What is with everybody?
今天是感恩节  不是012---It's Thanksgiving, not...
告秘日012---...Truth Day.
等大家吃到那道香蕉肉甜点012---Look, when everyone eats that banana-meat thing...
一定会取笑她  那样的话也好吗012---...they'll all make fun of her. Do you want that?
好  我们就叫大家假装喜欢012---Okay. We'll just get everyone to act like they like it.
那样就不会有人取笑她012---That way, no one makes fun of her...
我们也可以去找那些小辣椒012---...and we still get to go to sweet potato pie.
兄弟  别把她们物化012---Dude, they're not objects.
好012---Oh.
开玩笑的  我去告诉大家  你把瑞秋拖开012---Just kidding. I'll talk to them. You distract her.
瑞秋  可以出去谈一下吗012---Hey, Rach, can I talk to you outside for a sec'?
好吧012---0Kay.
什么事  罗斯012---What's up, Ross?
所以012---So, um...
感恩节012---Thanksgiving.
岁末季节又来了012---The holiday season is upon us, hmm?
是啊012---Yeah.
还有012---And, um...
你今天很漂亮012---...you look nice today.
不  不  罗斯  不要这样  什么012---Oh, no. No, Ross, don't do this. What?
我觉得我们不适合复合了012---I just don't think us getting back together is a good idea.
嗯012---Huh?
我早就料到会这样012---I thought this might happen today.
罗斯  我知道逢年过节特别难熬012---Ross, I know the holidays can be rough...
而且你一个人八成很辛苦012---...and it's probably really hard for you to be alone right now.
你也是一个人012---You're alone.
不  我跟菲比住012---No, I live with Phoebe.
你就真的只有一个人012---I mean, you're alone-alone.
好吗  但这个时机真的不对   抱歉012---And it's just not the time for us. I'm sorry.
我总得试试看012---Oh, well. Can't blame a guy for trying.
要是有人不知道怎么装012---And, uh, if anyone needs help pretending to like it...
我在表演课学过  你们可以摸摸肚子012---...I learned some things in acting class. Try, uh, rubbing your stomach.
或是说 "嗯"012---Or, uh, saying "Mm."
加上微笑012---And, uh, oh, smiling.
好啊012---Okay?
我再也不花钱  让你去上表演课了012---Yeah, I'm not gonna pay for those acting classes anymore.
瑞秋  你回来了  快上甜点吧012---Rachel, there you are. Come on, Let's serve that dessert already.
乔伊   别再催我了  你知道吗   罚你不准吃012---Joey, you have to stop rushing me. You know what? You don't get any dessert.
是么012---Really?
骗你的  我才不会虐待你012---No, just kidding. I would never do that to you.
好  各位  酒果酱松糕时间到012---Okay, everybody, it's trifle time.
这是英式酒果酱松糕  对吧012---So, now, Rach, this is a traditional English trifle, isn't it?
一点也没错012---It sure is. Wow.
那你是加牛肉还是茄子012---So did you make it with beef or eggplant?
牛肉  我不能吃  你也知道我不吃肉012---Beet I can't have any. I don't eat meat. Oh.
哦012---Aw.
摩妮卡  我要你第一个品尝012---Monica, I want you to have the first taste.
是吗012---Really?
等等  你只挖了鲜奶油012---Wait, you only got whipped cream.
你得挖到每一层012---You gotta take a bite with all the layers.
好012---0Kay.
等等  你掉了一颗豌豆012---You dropped a pea.
怎么样012---Well?
嗯012---Mm.
好好吃012---It's good.
真的吗  多好吃012---Really? How good?
好吃到012---It's so good that I feel really selfish...
我一个人吃会过意不去012---...about being the only one who's eating it.
我们应该让每个人都享用012---I think we should have everyone taste how good it is.
尤其是罗斯012---Especially Ross.
真是太好吃了  我要去阳台吃012---Yeah. This is so good that I'm gonna go enjoy it on the balcony.
边看风景边享用012---So that I can enjoy the view whilst I enjoy my dessert.
我要去房里打电话012---I've gotta call my friend...
告诉我的朋友玛丽有多好吃012---...and tell her how good this is from Monica's room.
我帮你拨号012---I'll help you dial.
我要去浴室012---I'm gonna go into the bathroom...
边吃边照镜子012---...so I can look at it in the mirror as I eat it.
这是怎么回事  不好吃吗012---Okay, what was that all about? Does it not taste good?
我吃吃看  什么  不行012---Let me try it. No, no.
都没了012---All gone.
好好吃012---So good.
也许钱德还有剩的012---Maybe Chandler has some left.
味道好像洗脚水012---It tastes like feet.
我喜欢012---I like it.
不是吧012---Are you kidding?
有什么不好  乳蛋糕  赞012---What's not to like? Custard, good.
果酱  赞  牛肉  赞012---Jam, good. Meat, good.
一只乌就这样一把抢过去012---So a bird just grabbed it...
想带着它飞走012---...and then tried to fly away with it...
结果就掉到马路上了012---...and then just dropped it on the street?
对  不过值得安慰的是  掉下去之前012---Yes, but, if it's any consolation, before the bird dropped it...
他好像吃得很开心012---...he seemed to enjoy it.
瑞秋  来一下012---Rachel, come here.
好012---0Kay.
我刚刚小睡了一觉  又梦到杰克012---I was just taking my Thanksgiving nap and I had another dream about Jack.
菲比  我会想听吗  我不知道  你听听看012---Phoebe, do I want to hear this? I don't know, let's see.
所以  我梦到我们正要结婚012---Okay, I dreamt we were getting married...
结果他离开去救火012---...and he left because he had to go fight a fire.
所以我去一家夜总会  却看到他在跟一个女孩亲热012---And, um, so, okay, I went to a nightclub and I saw him making outwith a girl.
天哪  他在梦里背叛你012---Oh, my God, he dream-cheated on you.
对  但这时贾克库斯托出现012---Yeah. But then Jacques Cousteau came...
帮我教训了他一顿012---...and he kicked his ass for betraying me.
好酷喔012---It was so cool.
然后他带我去潜水  跟我介绍他养的海马012---Then he took me diving and introduced me to his pet sea horse...
他一直对我献殷勤  但是怎么可能012---...who was coming on to me. And, please, that is not gonna happen.
幸好我今天系了大皮带012---Boy, I'm glad I wore the big belt today.
五分钟前  那种话会让我神魂颠倒012---Five minutes ago, a line like that would have floored me.
现在却毫无作用   一点点啦  我毕竟是女人012---But now, nothing. Well, not nothing. I am still a woman.
罗斯  来吧012---Ross? Let's go.
关于告诉爸妈这件事012---Oh, yeah. About telling Mom and Dad...
我考虑用写信的方式012---...I was thinking about maybe writing a letter.
够了  我给过你机会012---You know what? That's it. You've had your chance.
妈  爸  罗斯大学吸过麻012---Mom, Dad. Ross smoked pot in college.
什么  什么012---What? What?
你这个告密者012---You are such a tattletale.
妈  爸012---Mom, Dad, heh...
记得你们在我房里012---...you remember that time you walked in my room...
闻到大麻的事吗012---...and smelled marijuana?
记得 记得012---Yes. Yes.
我说吸麻的是钱德012---I told you it was Chandler...
其实012---...who was smoking the pot but...
是我  对不起012---...it was me. I'm sorry.
是你012---It was you?
还有  害他被革职的邮差012---And, Dad, you know that mailman that you got fired?
他没有偷你的《花花公子》   是罗斯偷的012---He didn't steal your Playboys. Ross did.
前廊的秋千椅不是暴风雨弄坏的  是摩妮卡坐坏的012---Well, Hurricane Gloria didn't break the porch swing. Monica did.
罗斯已经离开博物馆一年了012---Ross hasn't worked at the museum for a year.
摩妮卡和钱德在同居012---Monica and Chandler are living together!
罗斯在赌城娶了瑞秋  然后又离婚了  又一次012---Ross married Rachel in Vegas. And got divorced. Again!
我爱贾克库斯托012---I love Jacques Cousteau.
酒果酱松糕里不该放牛肉的012---I wasn't supposed to put beef in the trifle.
我想走啦012---I want to go!
这三十秒真是高潮不断啊012---That's a lot of information to get in 3O seconds.
好  乔伊  你想走就走吧012---All right. Joey, if you want to leave, just leave.
瑞秋  这道甜点的确不能放肉012---Rachel, no, you weren't supposed to put beef in the trifle.
一点也不好吃012---It did not taste good.
菲比  很抱歉012---Phoebe, I'm sorry...
贾克库斯托已经死了012---...but I think Jacques Cousteau is dead.
摩妮卡  我真不懂  你为何012---Monica, why you felt you had to hide the fact...
要隐瞒一段重要的感情012---...that you're in an important relationship is beyond me.
其实秋千椅的事我们心里有数012---And we kind of figured about the porch swing.
罗斯012---Ross.
嗑药012---Drugs?
三度离婚012---Divorced again?
你是怎么了  儿子012---What happened, son?
我都是遭人哄骗012---L-I, uh-I got tricked into all those things.
钱德  你一直是罗斯的好朋友012---Chandler, you've been Ross' best friend all these years...
在他嗑药时仍不放弃他012---...stuck by him during the drug problems...
现在你又照顾起摩妮卡012---...and now you've taken on Monica as well.
我不知道该说什么012---Well, I don't know what to say.
你真是个大好人012---You're a wonderful human being.
谢谢你  不012---Thank you. No.
是谢谢你012---Thank you.
摩妮卡  罗斯  我真不知道该拿你们怎么办012---Monica and Ross, I don't know what I'm gonna do about the two of you.
我会跟他们谈012---I'll talk to them.
各位  香蕉012---You guys, it was bananas...
奶油加牛肉012---...cream and beef.
你们居然因为怕我难过而吃掉012---I just cannot believe that you ate that so that I wouldn't feel bad.
其实我没吃  还放在浴室里012---Well, actually, I didn't eat mine. It's still in the bathroom.
没有  我吃掉了012---No it isn't, I ate that.
我们的在摩妮卡的房里012---And we left ours in Monica's bedroom.
没有  被我吃了  你的也是012---Nope, got it and got yours too.
