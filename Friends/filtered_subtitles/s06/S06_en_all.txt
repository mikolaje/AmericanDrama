Okay, this is it.
You sure you wanna do this?
Hello, Mrs. Ross. Woo-hoo!
Well, hello, Mr. Rachel.
Whoa! Oh, my God.
Come on, Pheebs, hurry! Hurry, hurry, hurry.
Okay! Okay!
Oh, my God! Is everybody getting married?
Agh. No running in the chapel.
Hey, don't you give me any of your... Hey!
Hi. Hey!
What are you doing here?
Ross and Rachel left us a message saying they were getting married!
Isn't that why you guys are here? Yes.
Why else would we be here? Ha-ha-ha.
Well, what happened? Did we miss it?
We actually missed it.
Well, Maybe you wouldn't have if you could run in the chapel!
This is insane.
What's the big deal? It's not like it's a real marriage.
What?
If you marry in Vegas, you're only married in Vegas.
What are you talking about? If you get married in Vegas you’re married everywhere.
Really?
Yeah.
Oh, my God.
Oh, well.
Friends  S06E01  The One After Vegas
Why are we in bed together?
I don't know.
Do you have any clothes on?
Yes.
Really? No.
But we didn't have...
...sex, did we?
I don't remember much about last night.
It was such a blur. Ha, ha. Oh.
I remember laughing. I laughed a lot. Uh-huh?
Then we didn't have sex.
Oh, I mean, we were really drunk.
I'm glad we didn't do anything stupid.
Tell me about it.
Morning, Pheebs. Mm.
Well, my movie has been officially canceled.
Mm. Joey, I'm so sorry. You want some of my breakfast?
Nah, I’m too depressed to eat.
I'll probably eat in, like, five minutes.
So I guess I'll fly home with you. What time is your flight?
What about my cab? I don't need that anymore.
No, Joey! you borrowed my cab. You have to drive it back.
I don't wanna drive back by myself. I get lonely.
Oh, ooh. How about if you come with me?
I don't know, it's a long trip. That would be great.
We could talk and play games.
This could be our chance to, like, renew our friendship.
Are you asking me to have a "frienaissance"?
Sure?
Heh. All right, although I don't think we need one. I never stopped loving you.
Hey. Hey.
So, has anyone talked to Dr. and Mrs. Geller yet?
Mm-hm. They left me a message. They'll be here.
Where is the waitress? I'm starving.
It's a buffet, man.
Here's where I win all my money back!
I gotta talk to you.
Sure.
What's up?
Monica and I almost got married last night.
My God!
That's huge! Ha-ha-ha, hey.
Wait a minute. Why wasn't I invited?
And who was gonna be your best man? Don't say Ross. Do not say Ross.
I just don't think that Monica and I are ready to get married yet! Y’know? I mean, I love her...
...but seeing Ross and Rachel come out of that chapel...
...was like a wake-up call that Monica and I are moving so fast, you know.
How do I tell her without crushing her?
Tell her she's not marriage material.
What?
Girls say it to me all the time.
And believe me, And if she's anything like me, she's just gonna be relieved.
How do I tell Chandler that it's too soon?
It’s gonna break his heart, he’s not gonna think that I don’t love him anymore.
Well, you don't. Yes, I do.
Good. I was just testing you.
Hey. Oh, hi.
Y’know, We were just talking about bacon.
No, we were talking about tennis.
Tennis is more believable.
Hey.
Hi. Thank you.
Coffee. Heh. Mm.
What? Are we gonna talk...
...about what you guys did last night, or?
What do you mean "last night"? Nothing, uh, happened last night.
Uh-huh. Ross invited us all to watch.
Rach, we weren't gonna miss our friends marrying.
Huh, who got married?
You did?
What? Heh.
Wh...? Hello. We didn't get married. No, we didn't. That’s ridiculous!...
Wait, wait, wait. I remember being in a chapel.
They would not let us get married when we were that drunk.
They let you get married when you’re drunk!
Most people who marry in Vegas are drunk.
Heh, I'm drunk right now.
I can't have a mimosa with breakfast? I'm on vacation.
What are you gonna do?
Well, I guess we find a divorce lawyer. Uh-huh.
Well, I think, I think Ross already has one.
Now, this one's free, right?
Because you paid for the first two, third one free.
Laugh it up, but the joke's on you...
...because we don't need to get divorced.
We're just gonna get an annulment. an annulment?
Ross, I don't think surgery is the answer here.
Oh, that's your thing!
What?
Your thing, Y’know? that you're the guy who gets divorced.
Oh, yeah.
No, no, that's not "my thing."
I do not love getting divorced.
Yes, you do. This is your third divorce.
You love divorce so much, you're probably gonna marry it...
...and then it won't work out, so you're gonna have to divorce it, divorcing guy.
I'm so drunk.
So, what should we do? I don't know.
I know I love you.
I know I love you. Heh.
So where are we on the whole "going back...
...to where they have the marriages" thing? I love you.
That's a good question.
Look umm, Last night we let the dice decide.
Maybe we should leave it up to fate again. I love you!
Yes, We don't get married unless there's a sign.
Okay? So say, uh...
You roll another eight, then there’s a definite sign that we should get married.
All right. Eight we get married...
...but 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, we don't get married.
Sounds great. Okay.
Hey, we got a shooter.
Money, please.
Ready? Ready.
Come on, eight.
Yes, yes, eight.
Eight, easy eight.
Wow, I can't believe I rolled an eight. That was so unlikely.
Well, let's get married. I guess. Aah.
Wait a minute. That wasn't hard eight!  Last night I rolled a hard eight.
That’s right! It was the wrong kind of eight. No wedding! Damn it!
Agh! Aah! Unh, I wanted it so bad!
Wanna go pack? Yeah.
We're doing the right thing, right? Oh, of course we are.
Heh, we left it up to fate.
If we were supposed to get married, there would be a clear-cut sign.
Okay, you have 19 questions left. Use them wisely.
Come on, Joey. You can't win if you don't ask any...
questions!
What? You promised me a fun road trip.
We've been on the road for 6 hours, and you've been asleep for 5 and a half.
We are switching at the next rest stop and you are going to drive all the way back!
That will be your punishment, you greedy sleeper.
All right. All right.
Yeah. And until then, you are going to sing to me.
Because the radio's broken, and you are selfish, but you have a nice voice.
Really? Sing!
Man, this is a long drive.
Are my eyes open?
No!
Morning. Aah!
Hey. Hey, hubby. Heh.
Yeah. Actually, um, I wanted to talk to you...
...about that whole annulment thing. Uh-huh?
Yeah, I'm not gonna do that.
Okay. Heh.
So we'll just stay married.
Yes, exactly.
And I will make everyone call me Mrs. Geller.
Wow, this is so amazing.
I, uh, really thought I'd have to talk you into this more.
Okay, see now I’m scared because I don't actually think you're kidding.
I'm not kidding.
Look, I... I... Heh.
I can't have three failed marriages.
I can't, okay?
I am not gonna be that guy.
So, what, we just stay married forever?
Okay, how...?
How is this going to affect you, really?
I mean, you fill some form out once in a while...
...instead of checking the box "Miss," you check the box that says, "Mrs."
It's right next to it.
Ohh, Okay. I'm sorry, you're right. You know what?
We absolutely can stay married, ...
...because I was under the impression that the boxes boxes were far away from each other.
All right. Look, just...
...please take a moment here...
...and think about what you're asking of me. Okay?
I am asking you to do me a favor.
You are asking me to be your wife.
And, as my wife, I think you should grant me this favor.
That kid kicked me really hard.
Well, you did pull his hair.
He took my snack. I'm not getting into this again.
All right, you know what? Hurts really bad.
Well, I told you not to walk. Here.
There. There. Okay.
This doesn't mean anything, does it? No.
Okey.
How could you pick up a hitchhiker?
He could be a rape... He could be a rapist or a killer or something.
Don't you think I asked him that before he got in?
Y’know what? I'm not talking to you. You go back to sleep.
And, you, are you a rapist? No.
Do you like car games?
Yeah, you know the, uh, license plate game?
I love the license plate game!
Ooh, I'll play. I'll play.
No, you need your sleep. Night-night. Shh.
Hey. Hey.
Listen. I know you wanted to talk to me...
...but I have an idea that may make you wanna stay married.
We register and you get to keep all the presents.
No, Ross, come on. No, listen.
look I've thought about how to tell you this, and, um,
the bottom line, Ross...is we cannot stay married.
I don't know if that's true... Oh, but it is.
Ahem. Okay. You know what this is?
This is a difference of opinion.
When that happens in a marriage... Oh, Ross, come on!
This is not, this is not a marriage! This is the world's worst hangover!
Ross, listen, if you do not get this annulment, I will.
All right. All right, I'll do it.
Thank you.
Hey, hey, um...
...uh, is there any such thing as an annulment shower?
Wait! Wait! There's the train station, where I get off.
Well, I have your address and phone number.
And I have your name and the fact that you're a drifter.
So ball's pretty much in your court.
All right. See you, Pheebs.
Come on, Pheebs, I can't take this anymore.
Please talk to me.
Let me make it up to you, huh?
Stop it! Stop it! No.
That's not fair. You know I can't resist that beautiful voice.
Pheebs, look, I am so sorry.
I know I promised you a fun road trip with your friend...
...and I didn't deliver, okay?
But-but-but now I know that you think being awake is an important part of friendship.
So I will strive to stay awake for as long as I know you.
You can still sleep at night and stuff.
Thank you.
So can we play 20 Questions now?
I got a good one. I thought about it since Kansas.
Okay.
Is it...
...a kind of hot sandwich?
Yes.
Is it a meatball sub?
That is incredible!
You are the master!
Aah! Bug!
Ah! That's funny. You look like you're... Don't say it!
Don't even think it.
All right.
Okay Chandler, enjoy your handful.
All right, should we just, should we just get married?
Y’know? I mean should we just do it? All the signs are telling us to do it.
I'm sick of the signs.
It’s too fast, I'm happy the way things are. Me too.
I don't want things to change! do you? No.
All right then, then nothing changes! Everything is great!  Everything stays the same!
And you go unpack because it’s been three days and it’s driving me insane!
Jeez, relax, it's not like we're mar... Aah, agh.
You know, I was thinking, what if I, uh...
...unpack here?
All your stuff would be here.
Well...
What if all my stuff was here?
Then you'd be going back and forth all the time.
it doesn’t make any sense.
Okay.
What if we live together, and you understand what I'm saying?
Live together?
There've been no signs for that.
Me asking is kind of a sign.
Yes! Yes! Yes! Okay!
Yes.
Okay. Okay, wait. Wait, wait, wait.
Okay. Here's your key. Here's your key.
Now go out and christen it!
Go out and come back in!
Door hasn't been locked in five years, but okay.
Ready? Ready!
Okay, a little problem. The key broke in the lock and I can’t get in!
Wait. Oh, my God, I can't get out!
This isn't a sign! No, it’s not a sign! it's a very old key!
It's an old key! Oh, my God, it's old.
I love you.
I love you.
Are you hugging the door right now?
No.
Yeah, yeah, me neither.
Hey.
So did everything go all right with the annulment?
Oh, yeah. No problems. It's all taken care of.
Ross, thank you.
 Hey, do you guys wanna go see a movie?  Oh yeah, why not?
Pheebs?
No thanks, I've already seen one.
Okay, um, I'm gonna get my sweater. Okay.
Okay. You uh, you wanna wanna hear something weird?
Always.
I didn't get the annulment.
What? We're still married.
Don't tell Rachel. See you later.
What are you doing?
Key is stuck in the lock.
I can fix it. Hold on.
Watch out, watch out.
It still doesn't work.
I'm not finished. Oh.
Nice job, Joe. You are quite the craftsman.
Hi. Hey.
So, uh, did everything go okay with the annulment?
Oh, yeah. No problems. It's all taken care of.
Ross, thank you. Ah.
You guys want to go see a movie? Yeah, why not?
Let me get my sweater. Okay.
You uh, you want to hear something weird?
Always.
I didn't get the annulment.
What? We're still married.
Don't tell Rachel. See you later.
Hey, do you have any gum? Oh? Yeah!
Wait! Wait! Hi. Listen, Ross, can I just talk to you for just a second?
Oh but Phoebe, we'll be late for the movie.
Oh, there's a cab. Taxi!
Oh, that's great.
What timing! My God, huh? There you go.
Yeah, we’re, we’re actually just gonna walk‘cause it’s right up there at the Angelika.
Oh, the Angelika! Go! Go!
You didn't get the annulment?
I know. Ross!
Well, I tried, but when I got to my lawyer's office, all I heard was:
"Three divorces! Three divorces!"
Look, I just don't want my tombstone to read "Ross Geller: Three Divorces."
Don't worry about that. Your tombstone can say whatever you want.
It can say, "Ross Geller: Good at Marriage."
You know? Mine's gonna say, "Phoebe Buffay: Buried Alive."
All I know is, I can't have another failed marriage.
So you're gonna be married to a girl who doesn't even know about it?
Woman. Sorry.
Well, okay, so I don't have it all worked out quite yet.
Just don't say anything to Rachel. please? Rachel is one of my closest friends.
Although, being the only one that knows about this makes me feel special. Okay.
Okay, Stop, stop! Phoebe?
Hey, Rach!
What was that?
Sorry. Mix-up.
Hey, How was the movie?
I haven't seen it yet.
Well then you’d better hurry! The Angelika! Go. Go!
No!
Friends  S06E02  The One Where Ross Hugs Rachel
Y’know when we move in together, can I get a gumball machine?
Of course. Joey wouldn't let you have one?
No, when it comes to sweets, he's surprisingly strict.
Hey, have you figured out a way to tell him you’re moving out? 
No, no, I keep trying. And I can get out "Joey, I have to--"
Then I lose my nerve and I finish with "--go to the bathroom."
He may think I'm sick.
I really have to tell Rachel, but I-We just gotta get it over with.
Y’know, the next time we see them, we'll just tell them. Okay? That's it.
That's how it'll work now? You’re just gonna order me around all the time?
Pretty much. All right.
Hey, Monica. Hey, man, you feeling better?
Joey.
We have something to tell you.
Oh, my God!
You're pregnant!
NO! No?
No. No!
Look, Joe, here's the thing. Um--
Monica and I have decided to live together, here.
So I'm gonna be moving out, man.
Oh, uh, hey!
I'm really happy for you guys. Congratulations. See you later.
Joey! Joey! Are you okay? Yeah.
I gotta go. I've got an acting job.
Like you'd believe that.
This sucks!
Look, I-I’m just gonna be right across the hall. And I promise you...
...the minute Monica and I break up, I'm moving right back in.
Okay! Look-look-look, uh, If you're gonna move in with him...
...I feel it is my responsibility to tell you the truth about him.
He's a terrible roommate. Terrible.
He, uh, forgets to, um...
He always, he always, uh...
Oh, who am I kidding! He's the best roommate ever!
Hey, Pheebs. Have you seen Rachel? Hey.
No, why? I have some exciting news.
You're pregnant.
No!
Chandler and I are moving in together.
Oh, that's good!
Wow! But now if you were pregnant, what would you name it? Hint, Phoebe.
Hey. Hey.
What's up? Well, um...
Chandler and I are moving in together.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my little sister and my best friend...
...shacking up.
That's great. That's great. Mwah.
Guys, I'm happy too. Okay, come here.
Big day, huh? People moving in. People getting annulled.
Okay, I gotta go find Rachel. But, um--
if you guys see her could you please try to give her some really bad news so that mine doesn’t seem so bad? 
Okay, bye.
Hmm. Something bad to tell Rachel.
Bad news for Rachel. What could that be?
Could ya just, could ya just lay off, please?
All right? My life is an embarrassment. I should just go live under somebody's stairs.
Ross, It's not that big a deal. So you’ll been divorced three times.
you’ll still have a life, you’ll go on dates...
No! No, I won't. I'll be at the bottom of the dating barrel now.
The only guys below me will be Four-Divorce Guy...
...uh, Murderer Guy...
...and geologists.
Ross, you're being ridiculous. Okay? You are cute and smart and sweet.
and that is much more important than three stupid divorces.
Oh yeah? Have you dated anyone who's been divorced three times?
that’s not really fair. Y’know? Most guys who have been divorced three times are like 60.
Nobody cares about this except you.
This embarrassment thing is all in your head.
Here, I'll show you. Come here. What?
Hi. Listen, My friend Ross is about to be divorced for the third time.
But wouldn't you date him?
And if you wait right here, I'll go get Ross.
Hey. Agh. Thought you were Rachel.
What gave me away? I just tell her,
I have to get it over with. I told Ross and Phoebe. She's the only one left.
Okay, so that’s it, everybody knows! It's official. We're moving in together.
No turning back.
Are you scared? Are you?
No.
That was my scariest voice. You're brave.
Hey. Ugh. Hey.
The worst day.
Y’know, you think finally making progress at work, then your boss calls you Racquel.
Hey listen, for the first four years of my work everybody called me Sha-la-lap...
Seriously. I believe you.
So, it was right in the middle of a staff meeting so of course no one else wants to correct.
So everyone's calling me Racquel.
By the end of the day, the mailroom guys were calling me Rocky.
Well, I still think you're very, very nice and very pretty.
What?
All yours, babe.
Rachel, come here.
Have a seat.
0Kay.
Listen, urn, Chandler and I...
...are going to live together.
Here.
Oh, my God.
That's so great!
I'm so happy for you guys!
Really?
And that was so sweet of you to ask.
Oh my God, The three of us are gonna have such a good time living together!
Yes, we are.
And Chandler, you’re gonna have to watch those long showers you take in the morning...
...because you know Racquel can't be late.
Rach. He'll work on that.
Oh. Aw, this is so exciting!
Oh, wow.
Come and knock on our door
We'll be waiting for you
See? Once you know the stories, it's not that bad.
First marriage: Wife's hidden sexuality. Not my fault.
Second marriage: Said the wrong name at the altar.
A little my fault.
Third marriage: well they really shouldn’t allow you get married...
...when you're drunk and have writing on your face.
Nevada's fault.
Okay, So what do you think, ladies? Who wouldn’t be interested? Who wouldn't want to date him?
Well the divorces don’t bother me, I'd date him.
But not while he's still married.
Okay, what about you?  wouldn't you want a date?
Actually, I'm not dating at all anymore.
See, I figured out that I was only dating guys that were like y’know bad for me,
So I decided that until I work that--
Good. Good. Whatever.
What about you, Meg?
Well, I don't care about the divorces either.
But I wouldn't date him.
It's just that he's obviously still in love with this Rachel girl.
What?
She said, "He's obviously still in love with this Rachel girl."
This is crazy. I mean, yes, Rachel is my good friend.
And I have loved her in the past...
...but now, she is just my wife.
Phoebe, will you help me out here?
Well, I thought you loved her when you-when you married her.
We were drunk! I would've married Joey with that amount of alcohol.
Hey! You could do a lot worse than Joey Tribbiani!
I'm sorry, but you guys are wrong.
I just don't want to be divorced three times.
Yes, and now he's using this three-divorces reason...
...because he wants to stay married to her because he loves her.
I must say, well done. Bravo, Meg.
Okay, Fine! Fine! If this is what you think...
...forget about the whole three-divorce thing.
Okay, I-I’ll go to my lawyer’s office right now and get this marriage annulled. Okay?
She means nothing to me.
Noth-Nothing!
Okay, now I wouldn't date you because you seem a little creepy.
I am so attracted to him right now.
Okay, when are we gonna tell Rachel what is actually gonna happen?
Soon.
I just couldn't before. You saw how upset Joey got.
I couldn't do it. She's my best friend.
Joey's my best friend.
I'm not your best friend?
You just said--!
Of course, you're my best friend.
Would you please tell Rachel? Okay.
All right. At least I'm prepared. Okay.
Oh, yes. Hey!
Hey, hey
They're not for you. Are you upset? I am now.
Hey, roomie.
Okay, bye.
Rash. Ahem.
There's something, urn, important I have to tell you.
Are you pregnant?
No, but I'm throwing this shirt away.
I think there was a little misunderstanding before.
When I said that, uh, Chandler and I wanted to live together...
...we meant alone together.
Oh, my God. That's funny. I can't believe I did that.
No, sweetie. You know what? This is my fault.
I wasn't clear.
I'm really sorry.
Listen, you take as much time as you need to move out, okay?
There's absolutely no rush.
0Kay.
0Kay.
Don't you want a cookie?
Sure.
Thanks.
Do you need a tissue?
Monica, Where did you get these? I made them.
Oh, God, they're so yummy!
God, it’s gonna so weird like when I come home and you’re not here.
Y’know? No more Joey and Chan's.
No more J and C's.
Want to go to Joey and Chandler's? Can't. It's not there.
Look, I’m just gonna be across the hall, We can still do all the same stuff.
We won't be able to like get up in the middle of the night and have those long talks...
...about our feelings and the future.
Not once did we do that.
Hi. Hey.
So I told Rachel that it's just gonna be the two of us.
Oh, yeah? Well, how'd she take it?
Really well. Yeah.
Surprisingly well.
She didn't cry. She wasn't angry or sad.
And you're upset because you didn't make your best friend cry?
All I'm asking for is just a little emotion.
Is that too much to ask after six years?
I mean what? Are-are-are Rachel and I not as close as you guys?! 
I mean, did we not have as much fun? Don't I deserve a few tears?
When we told Joey, he cried his eyes out.
Hey! I did not cry my eyes out!
Come on, it's like the end of an era.
No more J-Man and Channy's!
Okay, I gotta ask, who calls us that?
You got married again?
Yes.
So that's your second marriage in two years?
Yes. Second in two years.
Third, overall.
Ross, I have been a divorce attorney for 23 years...
...and never have I had so much business from one client.
Why don't you tell me what happened?
Basically, Rachel and I were in Vegas, and we got drunk.
I'm sorry, is this the same Rachel whose name you said...
...at the altar in the second marriage?
Yes, yes, yes. Heh.
But I do not love her.
Oh.
That's better then.
This was just a drunken mistake, and I need to get it annulled.
I see.
Have you considered therapy?
I think just the annulment for today.
There are some forms to fill out. Easy.
We'll need witnesses who can testify that you were not of sound mind.
No problem. Heh.
And we'll need you and Rachel to testify before a judge.
There's no way to do this without her?
Because I kind of already told her it was taken care of.
Of course you did.
Look Ross, you can't get an annulment unless you and Rachel are both there.
What about someone who looks like Rachel?
I will think about the therapy.
Hey. Hey.
So, um, I was thinking that maybe we should start dividing up our stuff.
0Kay.
No point in dragging it out.
Dragging out the long process of you moving out...
...and us not living together anymore.
0Kay.
Hey, Rach. Yeah?
What about this? Who gets this?
See, I don't know if I want it because it might be too many memories.
What is that? I don't know.
Rachel.
How about this? I want you to have the big plate.
Wow, Monica, thanks. I love this plate.
Something to remember me by.
Mon, you're not dying. I'm just moving out.
We're gonna see each other all the time.
But still, it's a big change.
The end of an era, you might say.
Are you okay? You're not blinking.
I'm fine. I was thinking about how it's an end of an era.
Oh, all right.
But y’know I gotta say, I don’t, I don’t think six years counts as an era.
An era is defined as a significant period of time.
It was significant for me. Maybe it wasn't significant to you!
What is the matter with you? What is the matter with you?
Why aren't you more upset?
Aren’t you gonna be sad that we’re not gonna be living together anymore?!
Aren't you gonna miss me at all?
Monica, all right. But don't get mad at me.
It's just a little hard to believe.
What's hard to believe?
I mean, it's you guys. You do this kind of stuff, you know?
You were gonna get married in Vegas, and then you backed out.
I'm not upset because I don't see you going through with it. I'm sorry.
Rachel.
It's going to happen.
Chandler is gonna move in here.
But I-No, wait. Just let me finish, okay?
This isn't something that we just impulsively decided to do in Vegas.
This is something that we both really want.
And it is going to happen.
It is?
Really?
Yeah, sweetie.
You mean, we're not gonna live together anymore?
No.
Well...
Oh, my God. I'm gonna miss you so much.
I'm gonna miss you.
I mean, it's the end of an era!
I know!
Okay, bye. Oh, no.
So did you get the annulment?
I couldn't. I knew it. Because you love Rachel.
It's not that. Annulments are more complicated--
Complicated because of the love.
 I… I do, I do not love Rachel..
I’m gonna tell her right now about the whole thing ...
...so we can get this marriage annulled as fast as possible.
Okay? Would I do that if I loved her?
I've never been more convinced of your love for her.
I do not have feelings for Rachel, okay?
Oh, what's wrong?
Monica and Chandler are moving in here...
...and I have to move out and everything is changing.
Oh, my, come here, come here. It's okay.
Aw, everything's gonna be okay.
Thank you.
Of course.
So Ross and Rachel got married.
Monica and Chandler almost got married.
You think you and I should hook up?
Oh, we do. Ha, ha.
But not just yet.
Really? Well, when?
Okay. Um.
Ahem, well, first Chandler and Monica will get married...
...and be filthy rich, by the way.
But it won't work out. Wow.
I know.
Then I'm gonna marry Chandler for the money.
And you'll marry Rachel and have the beautiful kids.
Great.
But then we ditch those two and we get married.
We'll have Chandler's money and Rachel's kids.
Getting custody will be easy because of Rachel's drinking problem.
Ooh, ooh, what about Ross?
I don't want to go into the whole thing, but, um...
...we have words and I kill him.
Hey. Hey, check it out. This is unbelievable.
Joey has been holding his breath for almost four minutes.
Dude! You trying to kill me?!
Pheebs, I wanna ask you something. Uh-huh, what?
Um, well, since I'm moving out and you're so beautiful...
...how about I move in with you?
Well, that would be great, but then what do we do about Denise?
Who's Denise? My roommate.
You have a roommate? Yes, Denise. Denise.
Hey, what is with the secrecy, Phoebe? Huh?
And what about this Denise? She cute?
How can you have a roommate that none of us know about?
Maybe because you never listen to anything I say.
I talk about her all the time. Denise!
Hey Rach, listen,  I was thinkin’ uh, I'm gonna have an extra room over at my place.
Oh, that's true. Yeah, Why don't you move in with me?
It'll be great. We can stay up late talking, watch movies.
And you know about naked Thursdays, right?
Yeah, yeah, I think I'm gonna find my own place.
Hey, hey. I thought naked Thursdays was just our thing, man.
Friends  S06E03 The One With Ross’s Denial
Hey. Hey.
So, what did Rachel say when you told her you were still married to her?
Oh, that. Um, she took it really well.
Oh. You didn't tell her, did you? No.
Of course not, Because you're in love with her. I am not in love with her.
She was very upset about having to move out.
So I didn't tell her we were still married, because she'd only get more upset.
I-I just comforted her, As a friend.
What do you mean, "comforted her"? It was nothing. I gave her a hug.
Aha. A classic sign of love, the hug.
It's also a sign of friendship.
Yeah, not in your case, Lovey Loverson.
It was a hug.
Just tell me this, did you or did you not smell her hair?
Smell her hair? Well, what if I did?
Ninety percent of a woman's pheromones come out the top of her head.
That’s why, that's why women are shorter.
So that men will fall in love when they hug them.
Come on, Ross, you're a scientist.
I was hugging her as a friend,
It's not my fault her hair got in my face.
She's got a lot of it, and it smells all, uh...
...you know, coconutty.
What? Oh. It doesn't mean I have feelings for Rachel.
Maybe it means I have feelings for coconuts.
Okay, whatever you say. But just be careful. Rachel's not in the same place you are.
Okay, if the place you're referring to is being in love...
...then she is in the same place as me, because I am not in that place.
Okay, I didn't understand that.
But maybe that's because you were speaking the secret language of love.
Hey. Hey.
Dude, some guy just called for you. Who was it?
I don't know.
How about "Thanks for taking the message"? Jeez.
Hey, listen.
When you move in, Rachel's room's gonna be empty.
You wanna talk about what we wanna do with it?
Sure. Okay.
I think we should have a beautiful guest room, right? 
...with a mahogany sleigh bed and bedside tables with flowers on them all the time! 
Then we could have a rolltop desk with comment cards...
...so people can tell us how much they love staying here.
Whatever, you know, I really haven't thought about it that much.
Well, I like that idea, obviously. Ha, ha.
But I was thinking maybe-maybe-maybe it could be a game room, you know?
I mean, you can buy old arcade games...
...like "Space invaders" and "Asteroids" for $200.
The real ones. The big, big, big ones.
No.
Okay, so you mean "no" as in, "Gee, Chandler, what an interesting idea.
Let's discuss it before we reject it completely."
Oh. I'm sorry. Of course.
Yes. Interesting idea, um, talk about it, but no.
So that's it?
Well, I just don't think that arcade games go in the beautiful guest room.
The beautiful guest room's gonna be filled with antiques.
Which is why "Asteroids" is perfect. It's the oldest game.
What do you have against the beautiful guest room
I don't have anything against the guest room.
Especially since everybody that we know lives about 30 seconds away.
Are you mocking me?
No, I'm not mocking you or your beautiful guest room.
What's up?
Nothing. Monica and I had a stupid fight.
But you're still moving in together, right? Because my ad came out today.
"Wanted: Female roommate, nonsmoker, nonugly."
Nice. Ah?
I just figured y’know, after living with you...
...it'd be an interesting change of pace to have a female roommate.
You know? Someone I could learn from. Someone who's different than me.
And what's more different than me, a guy who's not 19...
...than, say, a girl who is 19?
Not just a hat rack, my friend.
Pheebs, I have to ask you-Shh. I'm swamped right now.
You're just staring into space.
Um, I'm trying to move that pencil.
This one? It worked!
Pheebs, this whole apartment thing is a nightmare.
Every place that I can afford comes with a roommate who is a freak.
Look at this.
"Wanted: Female roommate, nonsmoker, nonugly."
it's just there's nothing. This city is full. Wait, no, look at this.
"Two-bedroom, two-bath. Must be nonsmoker.
Satan worshipers okay."
Oh. Yeah, but it's on the ground floor.
Hey. Hey.
Rach, are you still looking for a place? Yeah, why?
Okay, there's this guy Warren from the museum...
...and he's going on a dig for like two years.
And he's got this great place he needs to sublet.
So you interested?
That sounds great. I'd love to live at Warren's. I love Warren.
Thank you. Oh, don't thank me.
You wanna thank someone, thank the volcano...
...that erupted thousands of years ago...
...killing but perfectly preserving an entire civilization.
Here's Warren's number.
Oh, this is great. I am gonna call him right now.
Oh, okay. Oh. Thank you. Ha, ha.
Okay, you go call him.
I saw it.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I'm talking about that which you already know but won't admit.
You know, that you love her again. You relove her.
Look, I do not relove her.
I can't believe you won't just admit it.
Okay, just promise me that you won't do anything stupid.
Look, we're just friends now, okay? Why would I do anything stupid?
Ugh. Well, the apartment is already subletted.
I mean, this is just hopeless. I'm never gonna find anything.
You can live with me.
What? What?
What?
Oh, my God, are you serious? Uh-huh.
I would love to live with you, Ross. That's great. Thank you.
I'm just glad I could, you know, help you out.
Wow, I'm so happy for you guys. This is so, so not stupid.
Ross, Ross, you have no idea what this means to me.
I mean, I was gonna be homeless. You've just saved me. You're my hero.
Hero? I don't know. Well, all right.
Oh. I have to go tell Monica what a wonderful brother she has.
Aw. Mwah. Oh, please.
You're gonna say things now, aren't you?
No. No, I won't.
But I should tell you this.
This exact same thing happened to my roommate, Denise.
She moved in with a guy...
...who was secretly married to her and said he didn't love her but really did.
and it just blew up!
And that's how she ended up living with me.
Okay, that's a lie.
Hi. Hi.
Hi. Listen, I'm sorry about before. I don't need to have a game room.
When I was a kid, I only played those games because I couldn't get girls.
Now I can get--
Now I have you.
No, not that I think that I have you...
...or think of you as property in any sort of way.
I see women-Stop it, Chandler.
I'm sorry too.
Really? Yeah. Oh, yes.
Oh.
Listen, we don't have to make that a guest room.
we can think of something to do with the room together. That's a great idea.
We can easily think of a way for us both to enjoy the room.
Totally.
We don't have to come up with this now. Oh, good.
Hey, y’know what? Why don't we think about changes that we can make in the living room?
Changes?
Yeah, I mean, we're gonna have to move some furniture to make room for my chair.
You're gonna bring the Barcalounger over here?
Is that a problem? Well...
It's just that they're a set and they should probably stay together.
Oh, that's cool. Then I'll just bring them both over.
See, now you're taking them away from their home.
Okay, I get it. So I get nothing. Nothing here is mine. Everything is yours.
I'll get up in the morning, put on your clothes, and head off to work.
Yeah. Yeah, you know what? That's it. That's it.
Everything will be mine. Nothing will be yours.
Oh, come on. Chandler! I'm talking about the Barcalounger.
It just, It doesn't match. Where is it gonna go?
In the game room.
Look, it is not my fault that your chairs are incredibly ugly.
That's fine. That’s fine! I won't bring over the chairs. I won't bring anything over.
I wouldn't wanna ruin the ambiance over here at Grandma's place!
Everything on your application looks really good.
Oh, just one last question.
Are you and your friends gonna be over here all the time like partying and hanging out?
Oh, don't worry. I'm not really a party girl.
Whoa.
Now, don't just be blurting stuff out.
I want you to really think about your answers.
You can call off the roommate search. Hi. I'll be living here.
Oh, don't listen to him.
He's just some guy who wants the apartment.
But I don't think he's gonna get it.
Why did you take the shower curtain down?
That thing was a hazard.
I'm very safety-conscious.
Hey. Hey.
Oh, I was just clearing some space for your stuff.
Oh, thanks.
But listen, I was just at Monica's...
...and she and Chandler had a big fight and they're not moving in.
What do you mean, not moving in? They're still moving in, right?
No, no, they just had a big blowout over what to do with my room.
What? Over a stupid room?
y’know，I feel kind of bad for them...
...but I'm also really psyched because I don't have to move in here.
Oh, no. Yeah. No, that part's great.
What's all this about you guys fighting?
Is this really over a room?
I mean, that is so silly.
Ross, we can handle this. Well, apparently not.
And I can't just stand by and watch two people I care about so much...
...be hurt by something that is so silly.
I mean, enough of the silliness. Why don't you tell her to stop being silly?
Okay, okay.
Two very good points.
Look, I've known you both a long time.
And I've never seen either of you one-millionth as happy...
...as you've been since you got together.
Do you really wanna throw that all away over a room?
That is so silly.
What's more important, love...
...or silliness?
Well, we are fond of the silliness.
But we also have a soft spot for the love.
Love is the best medicine. That's laughter.
Why do you do it? I don't know.
Now, Chandler, you wanna live with Monica, right?
Yeah, I do.
And, Mon, you wanna live with Chandler, don't you?
Yes.
Good. A verbal contract is binding in the state of New York.
So I understand you're looking for a place?
No, no, I'm staying put. Oh.
I was going to offer you my apartment.
Why? Where are you going?
I don't know.
Hey, Rach. Hi.
Uh, you're never gonna believe it. Monica and Chandler are moving in again.
That's great news, right? I mean, for them, right?
Oh, wow.
But on the bright side, we get to be roommates again.
Yeah. You know, about that, um...
Ross, ahem, I really appreciate your offer to let me move in and everything...
...but don't you think it's gonna be weird?
Why? Why? Why would it--? Why would it be weird?
Well, you know, because of us.
Because of our history.
No. No?
No, no.
It would only be weird if we were still in that place.
I mean, are you still in that place?
No, not at all. Good. Me neither.
So it's not a problem.
We're just two friends who happen to be roommates.
Okay, but, Ross, eventually, you and I are gonna be dating.
Really? We are?
Well, yeah. I'm gonna have a boyfriend and you're gonna have a girlfriend.
Oh. Heh.
That'd be great.
But if you think it's gonna be okay, we'll just work out a system.
It'll be like in college. I'll hang a hanger on the door and put a sign:
"Come back later. I'm getting lucky."
Yeah, I didn't think of that.
So are you sure about this whole moving-in thing?
I mean, it's a really big step. And what's the rush?
That's very funny.
He's being silly because he knows we enjoy the silliness.
No, I'm serious, okay? I mean, think about it.
You move in, you start fighting over stupid game rooms...
...next thing you know, you break up.
Ross, you were right before. It was just a stupid fight about a room.
Okay, there are no stupid fights.
This isn't about the room.
This is about what the room represents.
And unfortunately, this room could destroy you.
Yeah, I'm not so worried. Yeah, no, me neither.
Fine. It's your life.
I just don't wanna see you break up. y’know 
Which you will do if you move in together.
But if that's what you want, there's nothing I can do.
Don't do it!
You still wanna move in together, right? Of course.
Ross didn't scare you?
Scared me out of ever wanting to live with him.
Come here, I gotta show you something. Okay.
Oh, my God, someone's killed Square Man.
This is where the Barcalounger could go.
You see, you can see the TV, and still, it's walking distance to the kitchen.
Oh, that's so sweet.
I wanna show you something too! Okay!
You know those big-big uh, road signs that say "merge"?
You know? So I was thinking we could get one of those signs...
...and hang it over our bed.
Because that's you and I together.
"Merge."
Oh, my God, I love that. Really?
"No."
Thank you.
If you wanna receive e-mails about my upcoming shows...
...then please give me money so I can buy a computer.
So, uh... Ahem.
Where are the other guys?
Well, let's see, Monica and Chandler are occupied.
Fighting? No, the other thing.
I really think it's great they worked things out.
Yeah, there's no breaking them up, is there?
Hey, can I borrow the key to your house so I can make a copy? Sure!
Here. Thank you.
Now, are you sure?
Because once I make a copy, there's no turning back.
Yeah, I'm sure.
Now get out of here before I change my mind.
Uh, listen, Ross.
do you really think this moving in with Rachel is a good idea?
I've been back and forth.
Yeah, well, maybe you should go back, okay?
Rachel moves in, and before you know it...
...you're where you don't wanna be, back together.
Yeah, I don't think so.
She's already talking about, you know, dating other guys.
That's not gonna work out.
Then she's gonna come home all weepy, and you'll be telling her:
"Oh, that's okay. You'll find someone."
And then, barn, she finds you.
Huh. Oh, maybe you're right.
I am telling you, Ross, she is definitely gonna fall in love with you again.
Now, is that what you want?
Heh. Is that what I want? Yes.
Here she comes. I'm gonna make your life much easier.
All right, well, the place was closed, I’ll just copy it later.
Or not.
Uh, Rach, why don't you just move in with me?
Whoa, whoa, Joey. No, no, no. It's okay.
I mean Look, Rach, I know I scared you off with that whole naked-Thursdays thing...
...but we don't have to do that.
Well, it would be easier to move just right across the hall.
Wait a minute, unless you're thinking about naked Wednesdays.
Thursday's clearly not good for you. Pick a day.
Hi. Hi.
Come on in. Thanks for coming back.
Okay, there have been a lot of people interested in the room.
But I have narrowed it down, and you are one of the finalists.
Great. Okay, now, before I make my decision...
...I just wanna make sure that our personalities match, okay?
So I made up a little test.
Now, I'm gonna say a word, and then you say the first thing that comes to mind.
I can do that. Okay, here we go.
Pillow. Fight.
Very good.
Okay. G.
String? Excellent.
Okay. Um...
DOQQV -
Kitten? Ooh, sorry.
No, no, no. So close, though. But, you know, okay, bye-bye.
Monica, which of all of this kitchen stuff is mine?
This bottle opener.
And...? And it's a magnet.
Look at that.
How weird is that? You know, you're moving in with me...
...and you have the one thing I don't have. Ha, ha.
It's like, in a way, you complete me. Huh?
Kitchen. What?
You complete me kitchen, matey.
Ross, I know what you're thinking. What?
That she's gonna move in with you...
...and then maybe fall in love with you, and then...
...when she finds out you're already married, oh, she'll be happy.
You know? You're just-You're very sad.
Oh, my God.
I see what this is. You are in love with Rachel.
What? Of course. It all adds up.
I mean, you're obsessed with her. It's always:
"Ross, what are you gonna do about Rachel?
Ross, why are you moving in with Rachel?
When are you gonna confess your secret marriage to Rachel?"
You want her. No!
Uh-oh. Saved by the bell.
Hello.
Hey, Rach. Aren't these Candlesticks mine?
No, no, I bought those.
Oh, right. I forgot. Yeah.
That you're a liar.
No, no, that's great. I'll be there Monday. And thank you again.
0Kay.
Um, that was the head of the paleontology department...
...at NYU.
Wow. What did he say?
Uh, remember that paper I had published last year on sediment flow rate?
Well, they loved it. Well, who wouldn't?
I know!
Anyway, they asked me to be a guest lecturer.
I mean, it's temporary, but if they like me, it could lead to a full-time job.
How great would that look on the mailbox, huh? Professor Geller.
Yeah. Professor and Mrs.
And Mrs.?
Oh, yeah, you know, you and Ross are still married.
What?
Just kidding.
Oh, God.
Saved your ass.
Friends  S06E04  The One Where Joey Loses His Insurance
Hey. Hi.
Hey. What's the matter?
Well, ahem.
You know that psychic I see? Yeah?
She told me that I'm gonna die this week...
...so I'm kind of bummed about that.
What? I know you don't know about readings...
...but that one is pretty much the worst one you can get.
Phoebe, that's crazy.
I can't believe she'd say that to you?
Yeah, honey, you don't believe her, do you?
I don't know. She, you know, said that I'd have triplets...
...but she also said one of them would be black.
Just out of curiosity, did she tell you how you were gonna go?
No, because she didn't tell me I was gonna die till the end of the session.
And I was not gonna waste a whole other hour there.
I mean, I've only got a week left, you know?
I've really gotta start living now.
Hey, everyone. Oh, hi.
Hey. Hey. Well, today's my first lecture...
...and I kind of wanted to try it out on you guys. Do you mind?
No, that'd be great.
0Kay.
"There are three primary theories concerning sediment flow rate.
Each of these theories can be further subcategorized into two"
Oh, this is it. This is what's gonna kill me.
"Subcategories. The first of these subcategories is"
Um, Ross? Heh.
Are there, uh, naked chicks on that piece of paper?
No. Why?
Well, I just never seen a guy stare so hard at paper...
...that didn't have naked chicks on it.
Oh, okay. Okay.
"There are three primary theories...
...concerning sediment flow rate.
Each of these theories...
...can be further subcategorized into--"
Why don't you open with a joke?
Open with a joke? It's a university, not a comedy club.
Wait a minute, hold the phone.
You're not talking about Chuckles University?
0Kay.
Ohh! We’re kidding! Come on, we're kidding.
hey you know what might make it less boring?
Thank you.
Some, um-Some visual aids.
Oh, oh! You know what's a good visual aid?
Please don't say naked chicks.
Why not?
I don't even know why I bothered to even talk to you guys about it.
You know, I'm just gonna do it on my own, with no naked chicks.
That's the way I did it till I was 19.
Hey. Hey
Any good mail?
Yes, you got something from the Screen Actors Guild.
Ooh, it's probably a residual check. Hey, can you open it? I got...
"Benefits lapsed." Hmm. That's weird.
I don't remember being in a movie called Benefits Lapsed.
Okay, it's not a check.
They're saying your health insurance expired because...
...you didn't work enough last year. Let me see that.
All right.
Oh, I can't believe this.
This sucks.
When I had insurance, I could get hit by a bus...
...or catch on fire, you know?
And it wouldn't matter. Now I gotta be careful?
I'm sorry, man. There's never a good time to have to...
...stop catching on fire.
All right, well...
...I guess I gotta go get a job. I'm gonna see my agent.
Okay, make sure to look both ways before you cross the street.
"Make sure to look both ways before you cross the street."
Hey. Hey, Pheebs, you're still alive.
How are you feeling?
It's so exhausting, waiting for death.
Oh, by the way, do you think you--
Pheebs, what are you doing?
I was preparing you for-Didn't you think I was dead?
Did that not come off?
Oh, yeah, scared the hell out of me. I thought we'd lost you forever.
Pheebs, you wanna lie down? Yeah, thanks.
And listen, can you do me a favor?
Could you just wake me up in a couple hours.
You know, if you can.
Monica?
Did you take these back?
No-no, I-I just, I liked them so much that I went out and bought some for myself.
Oh, yeah, they're really great, aren't they?
I love them. Yeah.
Nice try.
Hello. Hey, how'd the lecture go?
It went great.
And I didn't need any jokes or naked chicks either.
Oh, that's great. I'm sorry we weren't supportive before.
I knew all I had to do was let the material speak for itself.
Everyone's all, uh, "Ross, you have to be funny and sexy."
Well, I proved them wrong.
And now I'm gonna pass the news on to Joey and Chandler.
That you're not funny or sexy? That's right.
Hey, Estelle, listen-Well, well, well.
Joey Tribbiani.
So you came back, huh?
They think they can do better, but they all...
...come crawling back to Estelle.
What are you talking about?
I never left you. You've always been my agent.
Really? Yeah.
Oh, well, no harm, no foul.
Look, Estelle, you gotta get me some work. I lost my health insurance.
All right, first thing we gotta do: damage control.
Why? Well, I think, uh...
...someone out there...
...may have been bad-mouthing you all over town.
The bastard.
Hey. Hey.
So Estelle lined up a bunch of auditions for me tomorrow.
And I'll have my health insurance back in no time.
That's great, but shouldn't you be on the toilet right now?
What? What's wrong with you?
Nothing.
Well, I got this blinding pain in my stomach when I was lifting weights before.
And then I, uh, passed out...
...and, uh, I haven't been able to stand up since. Ha, ha.
But I don't think it's anything serious.
This sounds like a hernia. You have to-Go to the doctor.
No way.
If I'm gonna go to the doctor for anything...
...it's gonna be for this thing sticking out of my stomach.
That's a hernia.
Why'd I have to start working out again?
Damn you, 15s.
We're a little early. The lecture doesn't end for 15 minutes.
Yeah, but we can sneak in and watch. Yeah. Good.
Oh, hey, look. There's some Kappa Kappa Deltas.
I was a Kappa. Hey, sisters.
Wow, we really are bitches.
Right. So when Rigby got his samples...
...back from the laboratory...
...he made a startling discovery.
What he believed to be igneous was, in fact, sedimentary.
Imagine his consternation when--
Oh, bloody hell.
What the hell are you doing?
Look, I was nervous.
You guys had me all worried I was gonna be boring.
I got up there and they were all, like, staring at me.
I opened my mouth and this British accent just came out.
Yeah, and not a very good one.
Will you, please...?
Dr. Geller? Kurt Rathman.
I'm a professor in the paleontology department here.
Do you have a moment to talk about your lecture?
I'm sorry, I've got plans with my sister.
Monica Geller.
Right. Will you excuse us for one moment?
What are you doing?
You can have an accent, but I can't?
Top of the morning to you, laddies.
Would you just please stop?
Yes.
Bombay is very, very nice this time of year.
Hey, will you grab me a cruller?
Sit down.
Will you go to the hospital? Dude, hernia operations cost, like...
...a lot probably, okay?
Besides, it's getting darker and more painful.
That means it's healing.
Look, I will loan you the money.
Just go to the hospital and let's just get that thing...
...pushed back in.
Thank you, but it'd take me forever to pay you that money back.
And I don't want that hanging over my head, okay?
Besides, as soon as my insurance kicks in...
...I can get all the free operations I want.
I think I'll probably start with that laser eye surgery.
Hey. Hey.
Hey. What's going on?
Well, Joey's got a bad hernia...
...but it's nothing a little laser eye surgery won't fix.
Look, I'm telling you, if I put my hand on my stomach right here...
...it doesn't hurt that bad. Ah.
Hey, maybe you'll die.
Chandler, I'm scared.
No, we can go together.
Just don't wait too long, though...
...because I'm out of here sometime before Friday.
But I don't want to die.
No, no. It'll be fun.
We can come back and we can haunt these guys.
Give me them. No, they are mine.
You stole them from me. You stole them from me.
Give me them.
You just wanna each take one?
Yeah, that seems fair. We never use them.
Look, I really need some help, okay?
Why? Why did I have to speak in a British accent?
What do I do?
Well, why don't you phase it out? Yeah, phase the accent out.
People will think that you're adjusting to life in America.
Yeah, I mean, come on. No one will even notice.
I mean, they're probably not even listening to you.
They're not listening to me?
Of course they're listening to you.
Everybody listens to you.
Monica, do you really think I should try this phasing-out thing?
I think you look fine.
Whenever you're ready. Okay.
Hey, Timmy.
I've got a surprise...
...for you.
Hold it. I'm sorry.
The surprise is a new swing set. If you could play it less intense.
Oh, yeah. Sure, no problem. Just hold on one second.
Hey, Timmy.
I've got a surprise for you.
Oh, my God!
So that's why I feed my dog Purina One.
Pick up a bag today.
That's where you pick up the bag. Exactly.
No, the line is, "Pick up a bag," so you need to pick up the bag.
Or I could just point to it. Huh?
Blah, blah, blah. Purina One. Point to a bag today.
I didn't get it, did I? No.
Yeah, okay.
Hi.
I'm Joey Tribbiani.
I'm hereto audition for "Man."
You mean "Dying Man."
Yes.
Okay, come on. Do it one more time. Really? Really? Okay.
Ross, this is Dr. McNeely...
...from Fake Accent University.
We'd like you to come on board with us full-time.
Hey. Hey.
Listen to this.
My reading was wrong. I'm not going to die.
Really? How do you know? Because my psychic is dead.
She must have read the cards wrong. Oh, I'm sorry.
Ah, better her than me.
Hey, let's bake cookies!
Listen, I'm really glad you got the part.
Are you sure you can do this? Yeah.
And, hey, thanks for coming with me.
And thanks again for helping me take a shower.
Now, is that "never talking about it again"?
Hey, Joey. We're ready for you.
Joey, this is Alex. He's gonna be playing your son.
Hi, Alex.
And, uh, as you can see, my hands are not in my pants.
0Kay.
All right, uh, Alex. Now, when Joey says his line:
"Take good care of your mama, son," that's your cue to cry. Got it?
All right, let's do this.
Scene five, take one.
And action.
Take good care of your mama, son.
Take good care of your mama, son.
Come on, son.
Your mama's good people.
Cut.
Alex, remember, you're supposed to cry.
Can you cry for us this time? Okay.
All right. From the top.
Scene five, take two.
Take 36 is up.
Let's try this again.
You ready, Joe?
Uh, one thing, is it all right with you if I scream...
...right up until you say, "Action"?
Sure. Okay.
Action! Take good care of your mama, son.
Cut. Aah!
I'm sorry. Hey, hey. Joe, why don't you lift up your shirt?
Take a look at this, kiddo.
We have a crying child! Roll the damn cameras!
Hello. Hello, is Ross there?
No, he's not. Can I take a message?
Yes, this is Russell, Ross' divorce lawyer.
Just tell him that since I haven't heard from him...
...I assume he's decided to give the marriage a try.
Ross got married again? Aah! No.
All right, keep going. We are phasing the accent out.
Phasing it out.
"So without retesting their results in the laboratory...
...the team would never haveidenfified".
...the initial errors in their carbon dating analysis."
Were there any questions at this point?
Yes. What's happening to your accent?
Come again? What's this nonsense?
All right. I'm not English.
I'm from Long Island.
I was really nervous, and the accent...
...just, um-Just came out.
Ha, ha. I'm sorry.
So if we could just get back to the lecture.
Um, were there any questions?
About paleontology?
All right, look, I was just trying to make a good first impression.
Obviously, I screwed up.
But what you guys think of me is really important...
...because I'm hoping to get a permanent job here.
So if you'd just give me another chance to make a good impression--
Ross. Are you crazy?
I am still your wife? What, were you just never gonna tell me?
What the hell is wrong with you?
Ugh, I could just kill you!
Well, hello, Rachel.
You've really done this before? Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
You just take a big, big swing, okay?
Now, don't hold back.
Hey. Hey.
What are you doing?
We're just celebrating that Joey got his health insurance back.
Oh, all right.
Oh, I cannot believe that you didn't tell me we are still married.
Look, I was going to tell you.
When? After the birth of our first secret child?
Ross didn't get the annulment. We are still married.
You're kidding? Oh, my God.
Ross.
Okay, maybe it wasn't my best decision...
...but I couldn't face another failed marriage.
Let me just jump in and ask.
At what point did you think this was a successful marriage?
Rach, come on. If you think about it, it's actually kind of funny.
Okay, maybe it's best not to think about it.
Oh, this is inexcusable. I'm shocked to my very core.
Phoebe, I told her you already knew.
Another lie. You have a sickness.
Ross, just for my own peace of mind...
...you're not married to any more of us, are you?
Friends  S06E05  The One With Joey's Porsche
Oh, hey, someone left their keys.
Ooh, to a Porsche.
Hey, Gunther, are these yours? Yeah. That's what I drive.
I make 4 bucks an hour. I saved up for 350 years.
Hey, did anybody lose their keys?
Joey, why don’t you put them in the lost and found?
There's a lost and found?
My Shoe!
You left a shoe here?
Well, I didn't realize till I got home.
I wasn't gonna walk all the way back down here with one shoe.
I'm gonna go find that guy's car and leave a note on the windshield.
Oh, good. When he comes back for his keys, I'll be sure to give him your shoe.
Great. Thanks.
Oh, good, good. You guys are here. Listen.
How would you like to spend tomorrow...
...taking care of three incredibly cute little puppies?
Oh, my God. What a fun day. That sounds great.
Yeah, all right.
Okay, well, I'll bring them by tomorrow morning.
Okay, and by the way, they're not actually puppies.
They're Frank and Alice's triplets. Okay, see you.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What?
Please, please, please? Frank and Alice...
...asked me to baby sit the triplets and I’m nervous ‘cause I’ve never done that before by myself!
Don’t worry about it Phoebe, we’ll absolutely do it.
Yeah, I'm gonna pass, because I was kind of iffy when it was puppies.
Come on, Chandler. Come on, it'll give us great practice for when...
...people with babies come to visit.
Nice car.
Yeah, it's, uh-It's not mine.
I love your car. Yeah. It's mine.
I bet it's fast. Me too. Yeah.
And comfortable.
Do you, uh, like leather seats? Yeah.
It's got them.
So, I still have boxes here.
I still have boxes at Ross'.
And I have nowhere to live.
Wow, I could so easily freak out right now.
What about me?
I just found out Denise is leaving town for a while. I don't have a roommate.
Well, maybe I could be your roommate, Pheebs.
Maybe you could be my roommate.
Well, there's an idea. Yeah.
That would be great. Oh.
Wait, how long is Denise gone for? Um, she said she'd be back December 26th.
Oh! December 26th.
Heh, maybe she's Santa Claus.
Oh, look who it is. My husband, the apple of my eye.
Okay, I got us a court date for tomorrow at 2...
...and I picked up all the forms.
I'll take care of everything.
Sure, if you say you're gonna take care of everything...
...I have no reason to doubt you.
Give me those forms.
All right, now, I'm gonna do this my way, and I don't wanna hear a peep out of you.
Okay, Rash, but--Ah, you're peeping.
Ross, you know what? I just got--
Why? Why did you do this? Look, I told you--
I don't wanna hear "three failed marriages."
Look, if you'd had two failed marriages, you'd understand.
Well, you know what? Thanks to you, I'm half way there.
Oh, I am so mad, Ross. I don't think I've ever been this angry.
What about the time I said we were on a break?
Oh.
Pheebs, how's it going?
I'm doing okay. Do you think they're having fun? Am I talking too fast?
No. You sound like me.
It's going great. Look at Chandler with Little Baby Girl Chandler.
Little Baby Girl Chandler. Where have I heard that before? Oh, right, Coach Rubin.
You know what, Pheebs?
When you're done over there, we've got a kind of situation over here too.
Uh-uh. No. We are all responsible for our own babies.
See, that's where I think you're wrong. We've been playing them man-to-man.
We should really be playing a zone defense.
What do you mean?
I just think things will go smoother...
...if we each have our own zone, you know? Phoebe, you can be in charge of wiping.
And, Mon, you can be in charge of diapering.
And I can be in charge of looking at how cute they are when they put their hands...
That sounds really great, but you should be in charge of wiping.
Okay, I'm a rookie. I should not be in the end zone.
Wow, this is so great.
This is exactly how we set the plates at the restaurant.
Yeah? Well, this is not what I ordered.
Hey, guys. Hey.
Hey, babies.
I'm having the best morning.
That, uh, Porsche I've got the keys to? Still there.
Shocking, since you still have the keys.
You should see the treatment I get when I'm with that car.
People are friendly. They wanna talk. And not just about the car.
One guy advised me on my equity investments.
What equity investments?
The ones that got me the Porsche. Will you keep up?
I figured, if people keep seeing me just standing there...
...they're gonna start to think I don't own it.
So I figure I'll wash it, right? Monica, you got a bucket and some soap?
Oh, yeah. I got soap and sponges and rags...
...and carnauba wax and polishing compound.
You don't even have a car.
I know. But one time there was this dirty car parked in front of the building...
...so I washed it.
And? And six others.
There you are.
Yeah, she tops out at 130. Wow.
And that's just in the city. I get her up to 160 upstate.
Really? You got a place upstate?
Sure.
Well, I'll see you later. Okay. Take it easy.
Hey. That's my car.
Really? Oh, uh...
Just give me five more minutes.
What are you doing?
Well, I found the keys, and now I'm just polishing her up.
But it's my car. Yeah, but it's my wax.
Listen, I don't come to the city much.
And I don't know if you're crazy or if this is some kind of street theater...
...but could I have my keys?
Sure. Yeah. I'll save your parking spot.
I'm not coming back.
Why not? I live upstate.
Yeah, so did I.
I don't know why I was so nervous about this...
...and I don't know why Frank and Alice are always complaining. This is so easy.
Yeah, two hours, a lifetime, that's the same.
Check it out. Check it out. When the babies wake up...
...they can meet Krog.
What are you doing? That thing could put someone's eye out.
He can do more than that. He can destroy the universe.
No, Chandler, they could swallow one of those little parts.
And also, look at his smooth area. That's just gonna mess them up.
They're not gonna swallow anything. You're too overprotective.
When I was a kid, my mom used to just throw me into a pile of broken glass.
What? Glass, sand, whatever.
Oh, look at little Leslie stretching in her sleep.
Oh, it's so cute.
I wonder what age it is when you stop putting both legs behind your head.
Oh, I can still do that.
How are you still single?
All right, ahem. I thought about it, and maybe you're right.
Maybe Krog is not a safe toy.
Good. What made you change your mind? I swallowed his sonic blaster gun.
How did that happen?
Well, I was trying to prove that I was right, you know?
And it turns out I was wrong...
...and now it's lodged in my throat.
Damn it, this whole time we were concentrating on the babies...
...and no one was watching Chandler.
Okay, you two are asking the court for an annulment?
Yes, Your Honor. And here are our forms, all filled out.
So based on your petition...
...you are seeking an annulment on the grounds...
...that "Mr. Geller is mentally unstable."
Fine. I'm mentally unstable.
And based on the fact that "Mr. Geller is an intravenous drug user."
What? Uh, yes. Heroin and crack.
Crack isn't even an intravenous drug.
Well, you would know.
Now, it also says here that you:
"Lied about your sexual preference before marriage."
Oh, come on. Ross, please. I found the magazines.
And, finally, that you were "unable to consummate the marriage."
Well, that makes sense since you're gay and addicted to heroin.
Okay, you know, I'm sorry, this is insane.
I'm not addicted to heroin, I'm not gay, and there is no problem...
...with my ability to consummate anything.
Look, I'll consummate this marriage right here, right now.
That won't be necessary.
And when we were dating, we consummated like bunnies.
Now, if you two were involved in a serious relationship, that really creates a problem.
Your Honor, rest assured, that relationship ended two years ago.
And can you please strike "consummated like bunnies" from the record.
Is there anything in this record that is actually true?
Uh, well, yes. We got married in Vegas.
And, uh, the names, I think.
Well, based on what I've heard...
...you two certainly don't qualify for an annulment.
If you don't wanna be together, you'll have to file for divorce.
That's great. You happy now? Look what you did with your funny, funny form.
What? Me? What about you and your "consummated like bunnies" nonsense?
And what--? What are you typing that for?
She already said we don't get the annulment.
Don't type that. What--?
Stop typing. Hey.
Stop typing.
Stop typing, "stop typing"
Okay, okay, do you see what you're keeping me married to?
You need to get out of my chambers.
All right, lady, here's the deal.
I came here for an annulment, and I'm not leaving here until I get one.
Would you like to spend the night in jail? Thank you for your time.
That Porsche guy took his car back.
But you found the keys to his clothes?
No, I just, uh...
I love the way it feels when everybody thinks I own a Porsche.
People would think you own a Porsche because of the clothes?
Of course.
Only an idiot would wear this stuff if he didn't have the car.
That is true.
Yeah, but only a genius would swallow a sonic blaster gun.
Oh, I've been there.
I am gonna go drive my Porsche.
Joey, you know you don't actually have one.
Come on. What are you doing? I'm in character. Will you talk to her?
Ah, I think it just moved. It's really poking me.
That's it. We're going to the emergency room.
What? No, you can't leave me here with them. We're babysitting.
The babies are asleep. I'm sure you'll be okay on your own.
But you can't leave me with them. We're a team.
We're playing a zone. They're gonna triple-team me.
He's got something plastic in his throat. We gotta go to the hospital.
But, no, because a doctor won't be able to help him. And it's just gonna, you know...
...naturally pass through his system in, like, seven years.
I think that's gum. I'm pretty sure it's gun.
Okay, listen, this really hurts. Let's go.
But no. A real man wouldn't just run to the hospital.
No. What would Krog do?
Why isn't that valet back with my Porsche?
Maybe because you've got the keys?
That was totally your fault. My fault? You threatened the judge.
Well, you ripped the paper out of the court reporter's machine.
That was the only way I could get him to stop typing!
Hi. How are the Gellers?
Don't call us that.
The judge wouldn't let us get an annulment. Now we gotta get a divorce.
Did a Porsche throw up on you?
Hey
It's "Porsche."
Me taking care of you is no problem, huh?
You guys feel safe, right?
Okay, I'm gonna take that spit bubble as a "Yeah, I do."
Let's get rid of this dirty diaper, Leslie. I'll set you up with a nice clean one.
Okay, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you. I just have to clean that up, okay?
Because, let's face it, we're at Monica's.
I broke it. All right. Well, that's just the way things go.
Okay. Good.
Why are there only two of you?
Where's Leslie?
Well, you can't answer. Leslie? Where are you, Leslie?
Leslie, now would be a good time for your first words.
Well, look at you.
Hey.
You are a little bit mischievous. My gosh.
Oh, you're a lot mischievous.
Well, it'll dry.
Okay, you sit with your brother and sister now...
...who aren't there.
Hey. How do you feel?
Well, let's just say that Krog will be equipped to destroy the universe again...
...in 12 to 14 hours.
Okay, so I totally took care of the babies all by myself.
I fed them, bathed them and put them to bed.
And protected them from a tornado?
Oh, my God.
I know. The babies are asleep.
Phoebe, what happened here?
I did it. I took care of the babies all by myself.
But my apartment. Was the setting of Phoebe's triumph.
But the mess.
Is not as important as the fact that Phoebe took care of the babies all by herself.
You're right. You're right, I shouldn't freak out.
‘Cause this is what will happen when you and I have babies!
When will that be?
Phoebe, would you take a look at this mess?
Oh, honey, thank God you're home. I was getting worried.
I picked up the divorce papers.
Uh, I've already signed everything. And I put little X's where you need to sign.
Oh, little X's. Great. That makes up for everything.
You know, you've done a lot of stupid stuff too, okay?
Oh, name one stupid thing that is as stupid as this one.
Okay, how about you flew to London to stop my wedding?
How about you told me you loved me after I was married?
Wait a minute, that was different.
I did those things because I was in love with you.
Yeah. Right.
You're right. That's very different.
So let's just sign the papers.
What? Nothing.
Okay, can we just sign, please?
Congratulations.
Okay, wait, Ross. Wait a minute. Um...
I, uh, kind of have a little confession.
What?
Uh, well, you know, this whole marriage thing.
Kind of my idea.
Excuse me?
Well, remember how we were too drunk to remember anything...
...the night we were married?
Yeah?
And yeah, I didn't really wanna say anything...
...but it just kind of kept coming back to me.
Um, remember, we were in the casino...
...and for some reason, you thought it'd be funny to eat a lot of grapes.
And I thought it would be funnier if we got married.
So, ahem, as a compromise, we decided first to get married and then...
...(Ross joins in) to eat a lot of grapes.
So, um...
Sorry I got us into this whole thing.
So then, I mean, if you think about it...
...this is all your fault.
Yeah, don't push it, though.
I gotta say...
...I know I divorce a lot of women.
Never thought I'd be divorcing you.
I know.
I always thought if you and I got married, that would be the one that stuck.
And it wouldn't be a secret...
...and we wouldn't have our wedding dinner at Pizza Hut.
Did I even treat?
No, it was on the house. It was a newlywed special.
That may be the most depressing thing I've heard in my life.
Well, I should probably get these to my lawyer's office.
Hey, thanks, Ross, for taking care of all this.
Ah, no problem. Yeah.
I'm gonna need a copy of those. Totally.
Yeah.
Hey, hey, hey. Careful around my Porsche.
Hi, Joey. Hey.
How you doing?
He has the most amazing Porsche under there.
I'd love to show you, but I just tucked her in. She's sleeping.
Hey, would you two girls like to go for a drink?
Okay. Aah.
Listen, I'm gonna be moving out, so you are gonna be in charge of paying the rent.
Right, and when is that due? First of the month.
And that's every month?
No, just the months you actually want to live here.
Ah.
Okay, here's the phone bill.
Oh, my God!
That's our phone number.
Look, I know I kind of sprung this whole me-moving-out-on-you thing.
So why don't I just cover you for a while? No, no. No way.
Joey Tribbiani does not take charity...
...anymore.
It's not charity, Joe. No, forget it.
Okay? I mean, thanks, but I'm done taking money from you.
All right? I can take care of myself. Now, what's next? Come on.
Okay, uh, here's the electric bill.
This is how much we pay for electric? Well, yeah.
So we'll do the rest of the bills later, then?
Friends  S06E06  The One With Joey's Porsche
So is Joey gonna have to give up the apartment?
I hope not. I tried to offer him money, but he wouldn't take it.
How much do you think he needs?
I figure $1500 would cover him for a few months, you know...
...but I have to trick him into taking it so I don't hurt his pride.
Yeah. Well, why don't you hire him as an actor?
You could have him dress up and put on little skits whenever you want.
Well, that would help the pride thing.
Hey. Hey.
Wow, you look great. Do you wanna move in with me tomorrow?
okay. okay
What do you girls have planned for tonight?
Instead of being sad that tonight's my last night with Rachel...
...we thought we'd go out and celebrate:
Rachel's moving in with Phoebe.
And also my birthday. Ha, ha.It's not your birthday.
What a mean thing to say.
I would never tell you it was not your birthday.
Hey. Hey.
Hey, so you guys have anything planned for the big last night?
Well, instead of just hanging out, we figure we'd do nothing.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Knicks' season opener tonight.
I thought maybe you guys would come and watch it.
I don't know, Ross.
Not if you talk about how you gave up basketball...
...to become a paleontologist.
I did give up a career in basketball to become a paleontologist.
Pheebs, I was wondering. You're not dressed yet?
We're supposed to start having fun in 15 minutes!
Well, and clearly, not a minute sooner.
Rachel, you are packed, though, right? I mean, please tell me you're packed.
Of course I'm packed. Monica, relax.
I wanted to ask Phoebe for her opinion on what I should wear.
My God, I cannot get a minute of peace.
Oh, my God.
Monica's just gonna kill you.
I know.
What you're wearing is fine for that.
You're not packed!
You're not packed even a little bit.
Surprise.
What? Don't get mad, because, look, this is what happened.
So I started packing, and then I realized, "What am I doing?"
I am lousy at packing, right?
But you love packing.
So as a gift to you on our last night...
I'll be coordinator.
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry. I didn't get you anything.
Oh.
Look, everybody has to help. Phoebe, you can help, can't you?
I have plans.
You have plans with us. That's right.
All right. Chandler can make boxes, Ross can wrap, and Joey can lift things.
Tell the guys they have to help out. Okay.
Okay. My God, thank you.
Hurry! Monica's gonna make you pack. She's got jobs for everyone.
Now, it's too late for me, but save yourselves.
Okay.
The movers will be here in 11 hours. Rachel has not packed.
Now, everybody has to help. Chandler--
No, I have plans with Joey.
I thought you said you were doing nothing. Yes, but for the last time.
Okay, fine. Now, Ross--
Oh, but I can't do it. Why not?
 I’ve got Ben. Because, because I’ve got Ben.
It's almost 8:00, it's almost past his bedtime. Where is he?
He's at a dinner party.
Is he really coming? Because I can see into your apartment.
Of course he is. Uh,
You think I'd just use my son as an excuse?
What kind of father do you think I am?
All right. Sorry.
I gotta go make a fake Ben.
Here it is. Our last pizzas together as roommates.
I wish I'd known you were gonna do that. I ordered Chinese.
Oh. Oh, that's okay.
Hey, actually, in a way it's kind of nice. You know?
Our last dinner together. Me, bringing the food of my ancestors...
...you, the food of yours.
Say, Joe, I had a strange idea for what to do on our last night.
What do you say we play a little, uh, foosball for money?
Are you crazy? You haven't beaten me once since my injury-plagued '97 season.
It'd be easier if you'd just give me your money.
Yes, it would.
Ahem. What do you say to $50?
Okay, you're on. Okay, let's play.
The big game. Italy versus...
...China, apparently.
Oh, look, it's the Rollerblades.
Oh, God.
You remember when we got these?
No.
Oh, I guess you weren't there.
You guys, we said we were gonna have fun.
Come on. Hey, ha, ha, remember the time...?
You don't remember?
Sorry, Pheebs. I guess I'm just really sad that I'm leaving.
I'm gonna miss you so much.
Well, this doesn't have to be so sad though, you know?
Maybe instead of just thinking about how much you’re gonna miss each other...
...you should, like, think about some of the things you're not gonna miss.
I don't think there's anything.
Come on, there's gotta be something.
Nope. She's perfect.
I have one.
Good. Great. Okay, you can go first.
Uh, well, I guess I'm not gonna miss the fact...
...that you're never allowed to move the phone pen. Ha, ha.
That's a good one. Okay, Monica, anything?
You know, does Rachel move the phone pen?
Aw, sometimes. Ha, ha.
Always, actually.
Good. There you go. Doesn't everyone feel better?
Not just the phone pen. 
I never get my messages.
You get your messages.
Well, I don't think it counts if you have to read them off your hand...
...after you've fallen asleep on the couch.
So you missed a message from who? Chandler?
Or your mom?
Or Chandler?
Or your mom?
Great, it worked. No one's sad. Heh.
Yes. Ah.
I win again. Ha, ha, that's, like, 500 bucks you owe me. Woo-hoe!
Man. Five hundred dollars.
That is a lot of electricity, huh? Woo-hoo!
Ooh, I gotta buy some food.
Okay, okay. Give me a chance to win my money back. Sudden death...
...one goal, $1000.
You serious? Oh, yes.
0Key.
Get ready to owe me. Okay.
Okay, here we go. Ready?
No, no, no! No, no, no!
one can beat me.
See, now that's why only the little fake men are supposed to do the kicking.
Hello?
Oh, hi, Ross. See, other people call me.
Ooh, your brother. Score.
What's up? I'm here with Ben.
Thought we'd say hi.
Put him on. Ben, say hi to Aunt Monica.
Oh, I guess he doesn't feel like talking right now.
Uh, he's smiling, though.
Okay, talk to you later.
I think it was better when you guys were sad.
Hey, oh, remember the Rollerblades? Oh.
You know what else I'm not gonna miss? "I'm Monica.
I wash the toilets 17 times a day, even if people are on it."
"Hi, I'm Rachel. ls my sweater too tight? No?
Oh, I'd better wash it and shrink it."
"I'm Monica. I don't get phone messages from interesting people. Ever."
Hey, I call her.
"Oh, my God. I love Ross. I hate Ross. I love Ross. I hate Ross."
"Oh, my God. I can't find a boyfriend.
So I guess I'll just stumble across the hall and sleep with the first guy I find in there."
Yeah, we should get a move on if we want to make those dinner reservations.
Still broken?
It sucks, man.
Your last night here, and I lose the two most important things in my life,
The foosball table...
...and $500.
Well, you know, there are other ways you can win back your money,how about a little uh.
a little Blackjack? Ah, not my game.
Okay, uh, how about--you know what? We could play a new game.
A new game. It's fun. What's it called?
Cups.
I don't know how to play Cups. I’ll teach ya! Come on, come on, really easy and really, really fun..
All right. Okay, here you go.
I have two queens. What do you have?
A two and a five. Whoa, you win. Fifty dollars.
Really? Oh, yeah. Okay, let's play again. Ready?
What have you got? A four and a nine.
You're kidding, right?
No. Why? Well, that's a full cup.
Damn, I am good at Cups.
I'm not talking to her.
One of you has to take the first step...
...and it should be you because she's the one who's leaving.
It's harder for her.
Maybe you're right.
She made fun of my phone pen.
I know. I took it hard too.
Listen, Rachel, I feel bad about what happened--
What are you doing? I'm unpacking.
What? I'm not moving. Is that picture straight?
It needs to go about 2O blocks to the left.
Hey, you know what?
You're the one who wants this big change and move in with Chandler.
You should be the one to go! Why do I have to leave?
Because It's my apartment! Well, it's mine too. What else you got?
How about: You're moving!
No, no, no. Yes, yes, yes.
Okay, Monica--
This is ridiculous.
We should be packing you.
Hey, how you guys doing? Great. Monica's moving.
I am not!
Oh, really? Well, how come all your stuff is in this box?
Okay, you guys, you guys, I think I know what's going on here.
Okay? You guys? Stop!
I know that, I know that you're acting mad because you think that will make it easier to leave.
But deep down, you're still really sad. Deep, deep down.
No, Phoebe, I am mad! Well, deep, deep, deep down.
Yeah, I'm just mad.
Then keep running.
You win.
What did you have? Doesn't matter. Nothing beats...
...a three and a six.
That, my friend, is "D Cup."
Okay, now, how much have you won so far?
Wow. Seven hundred. Not 700 exactly?
Yeah. Heh. Double it.
What? Yeah, see, in Cups, once you get $700...
...you have to double it.
Really? Hey, I didn't make up the rules.
Okay, so now, after you receive the doubling bonus, you get, uh, one card.
Now, that one card could be worth $100, which brings your total to 1500.
Ooh. No, no, no.
Don't get too excited, because that's not gonna happen unless you get the-No way.
Well, this is the last box of your clothes.
I'm just gonna label it "What were you thinking?"
Funny, I was just gonna go across the hall and write that on Chandler.
Okay, you guys, I don't mean to make things worse, but...
...I don't wanna live with Rachel anymore.
What? You're just so mean to each other.
And I don't wanna end up like that with Rachel. I still like you.
Well, Phoebe, that's fine because I'm not moving.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Phoebe, you gotta take her.
You know, I know I said some bad stuff...
...but Rachel does have some qualities that make her a good roommate.
Oh, really? Like what, Monica?
You know how she has 147,000 pair of boots?
Oh, yeah, good start, Mon.
She lets you borrow them. Yeah.
And you stretch them out with your big old clown feet.
Do you wanna live outside? Because it's getting cold.
She gets tons of catalogs...
...and, um, she'll fold down the pages of the things she thinks I'd like.
What else? Uh...
When I take a shower...
...she leaves me little notes on the mirror.
Yeah, I do. I do do that.
That's nice. I like having things to read in the bathroom.
When I fall asleep on the couch after reading...
...she covers me over with a blanket.
Well, you know, I don't want you to be cold.
And when I told her I was gonna be moving in with Chandler...
...she was really supportive.
You were so great.
You made it so easy.
And now you have to leave.
And I have to live with a boy!
It's gonna be fine.
Okay, Rachel. Now I can't wait to live with you.
You know what we should do?
Bring Monica, and then we can all live there together.
We'll have so much fun!
But, honey, I think she's moving in with Chandler.
Oh, that's right.
You're still set on that?
Kind of.
Oh, my God.
Hello? Hey, Mon.
How's the packing going?
Ben? He's fine. Yeah, he's right-Oh, my God.
Get your head out of your shirt there, son.
What?
Yeah, it's a pumpkin. I'll come pack.
Hey.
What's wrong? Ross and I were helping the girls pack...
...took a little break. I lost $1500 to him in Cups.
Wha--? How did you lose at Cups?
The same way you lost.
I started outwith the king and the queen. Barn. Ross gets a two and a three.
Then I get a jack and a king. Boom. Ross gets a four and five.
Even Ross was getting the Cup card, the D Cup...
...the sitting-down bonus. Meanwhile, I didn't even get a half cup. Nothing.
Oh, man.
He never played before either.
You know what I think? I think beginner's luck, very important in Cups.
Let's just play one more hand. One more hand.
No, no more. I cannot lose another dime. I'm serious this time.
In fact, look. There's-I wanna give you something, okay?
And let me give it to you now before I pawn it for Cups money.
Now, I want you to have the big, white dog...
...as a-Kind of a thank-you for being such a great roommate.
I can't take the big, white dog. You love it.
It's "him." Not "it."
Well, what if I bought it from you, you know?
And then your nice gesture would be giving it to me at a reasonable price.
Say $1500?
Wait a second. I see what you're trying to do here.
You're trying to give me money again.
When did I try to give you money?
Before, over there with the bills.
You tried to give me charity, I said no, you dropped it.
Okay, then we had a nice last night together.
We had some fun, we gambled, nobody tried to give anybody any money.
Now, out of the blue, you start with the charity thing again.
I'm just trying to help you out, okay? I wanna make sure that you're okay.
I will be okay. Look, Chandler.
You gotta get it out of your head that I can't take care of myself, okay?
Look, I'm not gonna miss you helping me outwith money.
The only thing I'm gonna miss...
...is you.
And now the dog.
Hey.
Call me when you get there, okay? Okay.
I'm really gonna miss you.
Oh, I have your key.
Here you go. Thanks.
Oh, God, this is silly. I'm gonna see you in a couple of hours.
Bye,house.
'Bye-bye. Bye.
Hey.
She really left. I know.
Thank you. No problem, roomie.
Can I ask you a question? Sure.
What the hell is that dog doing here?
I invented the game of Cups as a way to give Joey money.
And now you want that money back? Exactly.
Chandler, what kind of idiot do you take me for?
It's not a real game. I made it up.
I'm sorry you lost your money. But I won it fair and square.
At a fake game!
Now, if you wanna try to make some of it back...
...I'd be glad to play you for it. But I should warn you.
I am very good at Cups.
Okay, now, I assume the saucer card came up when you played last?
No. Hmm.
Let's see if it comes up this time.
Ready? Yeah.Okay. 
Hi. it's... Rachel. and...Phoebe's.
Please. Leave.
Leave.
But I just said "leave."
Yeah, I know, because you have all the good words.
What do I get? I get "it’s," "and" oh I'm sorry, I have "A." Forget it.
Phoebe, that's silly. All right. So let's switch.
No, I have all the good words.
Okay, fine, fine. We can switch.
okay. okay
Hi. Everybody.
It's. Rachel.
And. Phoebe's.
Pleas-Wait. How did you do that?
What?
Oh, you're no ordinary roommate, are you?
Phoebe, come on, can we finish this later? I wanna go running before it gets dark.
Why don't you come with me? Really?
Yeah, oh, it'll be fun.
We'll run in the park. It'll be like our first, you know, roommate-bonding thing.
Okay, let's go running!
Yeah, and there's cute guys there. Let's run towards them!
0Kay.
Wait just one more second.
Hi, it's Phoebe and Rachel's. Please leave a message. Thanks!
Now, wait a minute. You just took all the words.
Uh-huh. You've met your match, Rachel Green.
Friends  S06E07  The One Where Phoebe Runs
So I just finished this fascinating book. Hmm.
By the year 2030, there'll be computers...
...that can carry out the same amount of functions as an actual human brain.
So, theoretically, you could download...
...your thoughts and memories into this computer...
...and live forever as a machine.
And I just realized I can sleep with my eyes open.
Hey. Hey.
Honey, it was a great idea, nailing the boxes to the floor.
I didn't nail the boxes to the floor. Oh, so you can move them.
Yes, and while I'm doing that, Ross has a great computer story for you.
Hey, everybody. Uh, I'd like you to meet Janine.
She's gonna be my new roommate.
Hi. Hi.
And she's gonna live with me!
It's nice to meet you. Janine...?
Lecroix. Janine Lecroix.
I didn't know that. What a pretty last name.
So, uh, where are you from?
Australia. I just moved here a couple of weeks ago.
From the land down under? Yeah.
I didn't know that either.
So, what do you do?
I'm a dancer. You're a dancer?
She's a dancer.
Well, I think I'll go and unpack. Here, let me--
Joey? Yeah?
Did you even interview this woman before you asked her to move in?
Of course I did. Uh-huh.
What exactly did you ask her?
When can you move in?
Thank you for bringing her into our lives.
Unbelievable.
Oh. Oh, so you like her too, Chandler?
Hey, look at all the boxes.
I cannot wait to ask her out.
Wait a minute, Joey. Joey, you can't ask her out.
She's your roommate. It'll be way too complicated.
Yeah, man, don't do it.
I mean, if you date her, then I can't date her.
Think about it. Remember when you were going out with Donna and you broke up...
...remember how horrible it was when you bumped into her at the supermarket?
Oh, God, yeah.
Now imagine you live at the supermarket.
0Kay.
No, no. Oh. Oh.
You're right. I don't want that. I can't date her.
And you'd better watch the flirting too, because in close quarters...
...it could be trouble. Well, that's gonna be tough, Mon.
I mean, it's hard for me to be around an attractive woman and not flirt.
Heh. Well, you're around me all the time, and you don't flirt.
A little sad about that, sweetie?
I have to tie my shoes, so you go ahead. I'll catch up.
Okay. Okay.
Come on, that's not running. Let's go!
You guys, I'm telling you, when she runs...
...she looks like a cross between Kermit the Frog...
...and the Six Million Dollar Man.
Monica had such a crush on him. Ha, ha.
She used to kiss his poster every night before she went to bed.
I used to do that too.
Oh,my God. Did you also have his album, It's Not Easy Being Green?
Oh, Mon.
So Phoebe runs weird, huh?
Yeah. And you know what? And I know she's gonna want to run again.
I don't know how to get out of it. I mean, I live with her.
Why don't you just be straight with her? Tell her the truth.
You're right. You're right. I should just tell her the truth.
Hey. Hey.
Hey, Pheebs, Monica tripped me. I don't think I can ever run again, ever.
Why? Why would you do that?
I don't know.
Rachel, I'm sorry that I hurt your ankles.
Ankle. We'll see.
Okay. I am officially unpacked.
Thanks for helping me, man.
JOe?
Well, I guess Joey went home.
Oh, and look, there is still one box that I have to unpack.
I got you.
Oh, my God, you almost gave me a heart attack.
It was so hard not to laugh, I'll tell you.
Hey, the place looks great.
Yeah, not bad, right?
You know what? Monica's working late, so I'm gonna make this place spotless.
You know what else I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna go downstairs, I'm gonna get her some flowers.
Now, who would not want to live with me?
I don't.
No, I want to live with the super-hot Australian dancer.
How's that going, though? Are you okay with the not-flirting thing?
Yeah, so far. Yeah. But it's tough, you know?
I've got all this built-up flirting energy, and I don't know how to get rid of it.
How you doing?
Oh, man.
Sorry. There's just more room out here.
Oh, no, no, you just, uh, reminded me that I have to do my stretches too.
Why don't you try to be...? Aah!
What's wrong? Uh, nothing.
I just-I didn't want you to touch me...
...because I'm all sweaty from the workout. Ha, ha.
I'm gonna hit the shower.
Oh, my God.
Oh, sorry about that stuff hanging in there.
It's just my thongs are too delicate for the dryer.
Aah! Hi.
Oh, yeah, uh-huh, it's me.
I saw you grab your running shoes this morning and sneak out.
You lied so you could run by yourself.
No, Phoebe, no. I was-No.
I was actually just checking...
...to see...
...if I could run. And I can.
Please, Rachel, I'm not an idiot.
No, wait. Phoebe?
Wow. Couples who live together do start to look alike.
So, Mondler...
Uh...
What, uh--? What are you doing?
What does it look like? I am cleaning.
Did you get Monica's authorization to move all of her stuff?
Authorizat. I don't need that. I'm gonna put everything back.
Put it back exactly where you found it?
Yes. I'm gonna put it back exactly where I found it.
Okay, first of all, that attitude is not helping.
She won't care if I put her stuff back in the same stupid place.
Hello? Did you just meet Monica?
She's gonna recognize that I did a nice thing...
...and appreciate it.
Huh. No, actually, this will work out well.
Because when you have to move back with Joey...
...Joey's hot new roommate can come live with me.
Oh, I see, I see. You're trying to freak me out.
Look, Chandler, Monica is really weird about this kind of stuff, all right?
Believe me, I lived with her for 16 years. She's going to freak out.
Oh, my God. She's going to sit on you.
No, she is not, okay? I'll prove it to you.
I'm gonna call her right now.
Phone's done.
Hi. Hey, Mon. How's it going?
Terrible. If I want something done right, I have to do it myself.
Other people just wreck stuff.
I really think I might kill someone tonight.
Oh, come on, come on, it can't be that bad.
It's worse. The only thing getting me through...
...is knowing I'm gonna see you soon.
I might get out of here early. No. No, no, no.
No, no, it sounds like they need you there.
You're just hanging outwith Ross? It's all good. Okay, bye, Mon.
She's gonna kill me.
The phone was facing the other way.
And that goes back up there.
Know what we should do? We should start with the big stuff.
That'll be the easiest. So, uh, let's start with the couch.
I got it.
Yeah, that doesn't look right.
What are you talking about? The couch is perfectly in line with the carpet.
Then I can just walk over here and casually just put my feet right up on...
Okay, here's what we do.
We just move the couch closer to the coffee table.
But then the back of the couch won't line up with the back of the carpet.
Okay, well, here, we'll just, uh, move the coffee table...
...closer to the couch.
No, whoa, whoa! But then the coffee table won't be centered in the seating area.
But the coffee table doesn't match the table-Ross.
Hi. Look, what am I gonna do?
I'm not flirting, but still I'm drawing her to me like a moth to a flame.
What the hell's going on over here?
Monica's gonna kill you.
Look, I need your help, okay?
I have to do something to repel this woman.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
You guys repel women all the time.
Hey, I've been married three times.
No, no, no, I've seen it happen.
You get a rapport going with a woman, but somehow you manage to kill it.
What's your secret?
Look, we do not repel women,
Okay? That is completely untrue.
Oh, yes, we do, my man.
Remember back in college when we went to that dance...
...and you walked right up to that girl you liked and couldn't stop talking...
...about the Irish potato famine?
Yeah, well, what about you? You weren't so hot in college either.
After everything he said, he'd go:
Yeah, Monica doesn't like that either. Maybe I should stop doing that.
You know what? Girls don't like it when I start talking about science.
That's not specific to girls.
This is great. This is great. What else?
They don't like you correcting their grammar.
And they don't like it when you explain why your jokes are funny.
You know, they don't like it when you keep asking them if they like you.
Man, I am so lucky I have Monica. I'm never gonna find love again.
Hey
Phoebe, can I talk to you for a second? Sure.
Okay. Um, I--
Phoebe, look, I just wanted to say that I'm sorry, okay?
I handled the situation horribly.
And I should not have lied to you.
So what should you have done?
Well, I should have told you the truth.
Uh-huh. Which is?
Well, you know, the reason that I didn't want to go running with you is...
...because, urn...
...well, you know, the way that you run is just a little...
So? Well, it's embarrassing.
People were looking at us like we were crazy.
Why do you care? Because they're people.
But people that you don't know and will never see again.
Yes, but still they are people...
...with eyes.
Well, I didn't get embarrassed running next to Miss:
Choo, choo, choo, choo.
But, oh, okay.
No, no, I can see why running with me would be embarrassing to you.
Yeah, okay. You're uptight.
What? I am not uptight. Whoa.
Listen, I am not uptight, man.
That's okay, Rachel. I'm not judging you. That's just who you are.
Me, I'm more free, you know? I run like I did when I was a kid...
...because that's the only way it's fun, you know?
I mean, didn't you ever run so fast you thought your legs would fall off...
...you know, like, when you were running towards the swings...
...or running away from Satan?
The neighbor's dog.
Okay, is this lamp in the right place?
Who cares? I repel women.
No, no, no! You can't come in here.
Ross is naked!
What? What?
I couldn't say that I was naked, because she's allowed to see me naked.
Why does anyone have to be naked?
Why is Ross naked?
I had to show Chandler something.
Naked?
Yeah, I uh...
I guess I have, a, uh...
A guy problem.
Is it the same thing that Chandler had?
Look, just come back later.
We'll get everything squared away, and you can come back later.
Okay. Hey, listen.
There's still some of Chandler's medicine left under the sink in the bathroom.
Bye. Bye.
Thank God.
Dude, what'd you have?
Look, we have no time, okay? We must focus.
We've got to get everything back into its original place.
The photo album.
There were millions of pictures of the apartment in the photo album.
We just go through it and match everything to the pictures.
That's perfect. That's brilliant. Yeah.
So really, what did you have?
Hey, Joey. I've got some beer for you.
Uh, don't you mean "for whom"?
Sure.
Listen, I was gonna order some pizza. You wanna share one?
Pizza? It's not like I never had that before.
Is there something wrong?
All right, all right.
Let's just get this out in the open, okay?
You're hot.
I'm lovable.
Clearly, there's a vibe going on between us.
But we're roommates...
...and it's a huge mistake for us to continue down this road.
Joey-No, no, no. I'm telling you.
Imagine yourself living in a supermarket and you'll understand.
Okay? So the question is, what do we do?
Well, I don't think there is anything to do.
I mean, I think you're really sweet.
But I'm just not interested in you like that.
Oh.
No, I mean...
You're a really nice guy, and I'm happy to be your roommate and your friend.
I'm just, you know, I just...
...don't feel that way about you.
Oh.
I see what happened. Ha, ha.
It's because I was trying to repel you.
Right? Believe me, you'd feel a lot different if I turned it on.
I don't think so. Oh, I do.
How you doing?
I'm okay.
What?
What?
Oh, dear God.
Hey! Hi!
I'm so sorry. You're right. This feels great.
See? And you don't care if people are staring.
It's just for a second, because then you're gone.
It's amazing, Pheebs. I feel so free and so graceful.
Oh!
Ha! Hey, look out for the horse.
Sorry.
Is it okay for me to come in now?
Uh-huh.
Why is everything different? Bye.
I don't see anything different...
...other than the fact that the room got so much brighter when you came into it.
Well, the end table is wrong, the couch looks bizarre...
...and don't even get me started on the refrigerator magnets.
Okay, look, don't be mad, okay?
But after I unpacked the boxes, I wanted to do something nice for you...
...so I cleaned the apartment.
So I moved everything around, and then I forgot...
...where it went back. And I'm sorry, I'm very sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
That's okay.
Chandler, are you afraid of me or something?
Do you want me to be afraid of you?
Of course not.
My gosh, Chandler, what you did is a wonderful thing...
...and I really appreciate it.
I know I have this thing where I want everything in the perfect place.
But I'd never expect you to worry about that.
Really?
Of course.
Oh, you're the best.
You come here to me.
Hold on, okay? First things first.
Okay. Now...
Did Ross sit anywhere while he was naked?
So it said that by the year 2030...
...there will be computers carrying out the same number of functions...
...as an actual human brain.
So theoretically, you could download your thoughts...
...and your memories into this computer--
And live forever as a machine.
Uh, so, Janine, do you know what we're doing right now?
You and I, we're interfacing.
Yeah. I gotta go.
Hi, my name's Chandler. I just moved in next door.
Would you like to battle me in a post-apocalyptic world...
...for control of the galaxy's last remaining energy source?
Sure, neighbor. Come on in.
So, is Janine around?
Uh, no, she’s at dance class.
Can I check my room?
Yeah, but, hey look, don't go through her stuff. She gets really mad.
Oh, my God.
What is th...it's like a guy never lived in here.
Look, you’ve got to be careful. This girl thing is dangerous. It's spreading already..
It is?
Yeah, Is this your pretty pink pillow on the couch?
No.
Is that your tiny little box that's too small to put anything in?
No. No.
Okay, this is not good. You are a guy, okay?
This is a "guy's" place.
If you let this go, you’re going to be sitting around with your fingers soaking in stuff..
All right, you're right. I'll talk to her. Talk to her. Be a man.
I'm a man. Defend yourself.
Chandler come on. We have to hem the new dust ruffle.
Be right there, sweetums.
A totally different situation.
Friends  S06E08  The One With Ross's Teeth
Hey, guys.
Hey, How was breakfast with Hillary? It was okay.
She's still kind of depressed because she broke up with her boyfriend.
Well, Is this Hillary, your hot assistant chef, Hillary?
Yeah. The one that always stares at me when I come in?
No. The one who looked at you once because you got in her way.
Still, I could tell. She was into me.
Well, Why don't you set us up?
Ooh, are you setting Ross up with someone?
Does she have a wedding dress?
Hey. Hey.
Rachel, Yeah. I'm making up flyers trying to get new massage clients.
So can I come to Bloomingdale's and use the copy machine?
Well, sure, but they might think it's weird considering I don't work there anymore.
Oh, my God. What happened?
I got a job at Ralph Lauren.
Well, that's great. Congratulations.
A year ago.
You've lasted all year. Good for you.
But, Pheebs, you could still use the copy machine where I actually work.
But come by at lunch so my boss doesn't see you.
Kim will freak out. She already doesn't like me.
I don't think my boss likes me. I don't think mine likes me either.
Maybe it's a universal thing.
Or maybe because you're all hanging around here at 11:30 on a Wednesday.
Yeah, let's head off to work.
Thank you. Sure.
Now you will not believe this.
But, I was in the copy room, making copies, and Ralph Lauren came in.
Oh, my God. Did you talk to him?
Yeah, a little. He seems really nice.
Good kisser. What?
What?
You kissed him? Totally.
Phoebe, are you serious?
Yeah, I was just in there, he came in and introduced himself.
The next thing I know, we're making out.You know.
Phoebe,I mean, you do know he's married?
No.
Phoebe.
What am I supposed to do, ask every guy I make outwith if he's married?
No, yeah, I should.
Hey, Joey. Hey.
Uh, can I talk to you for a second? This, uh, kid in this picture. 
Do you, uh, know this kid?  Is that like a relative or something?
No. I just thought it was cute.
Yeah, that's what I was afraid of. Okay, uh...
Look, Janine, I really want you to feel at home here, but...
...some of this new stuff, it's too girlie.
Oh. Like what?
Uh, like this. Pictures of cute babies we don't know.
We can't have that.
Joey, it's Anne Geddes. She's a famous artist.
I don't know this baby. I don't know if she's a famous artist or not.
I don't want to be a jerk, but you're changing too much around here.
I'm sorry. I just thought I'd try and make the place a little nicer.
Yeah, but it's too much stuff.
You know, you got the candles and the "foofy schmoofer" thing here.
Over here, you got a picture of a watering can.
I just thought-I'm sure it's a famous watering can.
But come on.
And what is with the really hot stick in the bathroom?
It's a curling iron.
Oh. Well, that's okay then.
Okay, my towels, for instance. I come into the bathroom...
...and my towel is not on the floor, where I keep it.
It's up here on some hook. And it smells different.
It's clean. Yeah, well, it feels different.
It's dry.
All right, I can make my peace with the clean, dry towels.
Okay, also, what is with these chips you bought?
No, no, no. It's potpourri. You're supposed to smell it.
Well, that's like summer in a bowl.
Kim, hi.
So you know, I…I handed in that marketing report and I never got to hear what you thought.
I didn't read it. Ah.
So, wow, the spring line's really gonna be great this year, huh?
Yeah.
So I hear, uh, Ralph Lauren fooled around with someone in the copy room.
Tell me everything.
Hey, guysHey.
What's up?
You know...
Oh, my God.
What happened to your teeth?
I whitened them.
Really?
Yeah, what do you think?
I think I shouldn't look directly at them.
Come on, seriously.
They're really, really, really white. What was wrong with your old...
...human teeth?
I did leave the gel on a little longer than it said to.
How much longer? A day.
Ross you know that tonight is your date with Hillary?
I know. That's why I did it. Come on, are they really that bad?
No. No, no, no.
You'll be fine. Hillary's blind, right?
She will be after tonight.
Oh, Rach. Uh, do you notice anything--?
Your teeth? Yes, I saw them from outside.
You guys are never gonna believe this...
...but Phoebe made out with Ralph Lauren.
What? Oh, my God.
She ran into him at my office, and they just made out.
The craziest thing is, now my boss likes me because...
...I told her about it and she said it was the best gossip she’d heard all year.
I am proud of all my friends today.
Rachel, I can't believe Phoebe made out with Ralph Lauren.
Ugh. I'm so jealous.
Hi, I'm Chandler, your live-in boyfriend.
Chandler, please. Come on.
Look at him.
Well, I am no woman, but that is one tasty dish.
Hey.
Here. Ooh.
Who's the silver fox'?
That is your make-out buddy. Don't you recognize him?
Oh, wait. "Ooh, Phoebe, I love you. Kiss me, please."
That's not Ralph Lauren. It sounds like him, though.
What?
Yeah, no, Ralph doesn't look like that guy.
He's young, and he's got long hair and a beard and a Hacky Sack--
Oh, my God. That's not Ralph Lauren. That's Kenny the copy guy.
What?
Oh, God-I told my boss that someone made out with Ralph Lauren.
If she finds out that I lied to her, she is gonna hate me even more. Phoebe!
Why would the copy guy say he's Ralph Lauren?
To get you to make out with him.
Oh.
Okay, maybe this will make them look less white.
Nope.Heh.
Okay, so colors that don't work are...
...blue, yellow, green, red, black, white, orange and purple.
I don't know what I'm gonna do. That date starts in like an hour.
Ross, maybe if your skin was lighter, your teeth wouldn't look so bright.
Oh, great. So all I need to do is get some new skin. Thank you.
I’m just saying, If we put just a little bit of makeup on you--
Whoa, whoa.
We're not 13 anymore.
Ross, this is the only thing left that has a shot at working.
Won't she notice I have makeup on?
Please. Half the guys out there have makeup on.
What?
Half the people-I mean-Just try it and see.
No, I am not putting on makeup.
Hello? Ross, could you put up some of these flyers for me?
No! Demon! Demon!
Now our drawers will smell nice, and we didn't waste these pantyhose.
God forbid we throw out old underwear.
You know what? I'm gonna go over to Joey's.
We're supposed to organize the wrapping paper.
Yes, but I've really gotten in touch with my feminine side enough today.
You know. In fact I think we're two sachets away from becoming a lesbian couple.
This has been kind of a girlie day. You're right. I'm sorry.
Nah, Nah, it’s okay. I feel like I need to be in guy place....
..You know, do kind of like a man thing.
Yeah. Go over to Joey's. Go over to Joey's and...
...drink some beer and hammer up some dry wall.
You know when guys hang out, they don't just drink beer and hammer up dry wall.
When girls hang out, we don't have pillow fights in our underwear.
I'm sorry. We do. We do.
I don't know why I said that.
Hey, Chandler.
Come on in. We're knitting potholders.
No, thanks, Josephine.
Ross, I was wondering if--
Oh, my God. Where are all the men?
Oh. Hi, Kim. Hi, Rachel.
Yeah, remember that thing I told you that happened yesterday? Well, it didn't happen.
You didn't cancel the fabric order from Taiwan?
Okay, two things didn't happen.
Remember I told you someone made out with Ralph Lauren in the copy room?
Well, it turns out that's not true.
It's not true? Oh, that's interesting.
Because I checked. Only one keycard was used to access the copy machine...
...yesterday during lunch, and that keycard belonged to you, Rachel.
Oh, no. No, no, no. Oh, God, you think I made outwith him?
Listen to me, if you think sleeping with Ralph is gonna get you my job...
..you are sadly mistaken.
Oh, no. I don't want your job. I don't.
Oh, this is such a mistake. I didn't make outwith him.
Nobody made out with him. I did not use my keycard yesterday.
I don't even know how to use my keycard.
Hi, Ralph. Hi, Kim.
Yeah. Nothing happened.
You could cut the sexual tension in here with a knife.
After that, what could I do except become a chef?
And someday soon, I hope to open my own restaurant.
Mm.
You know, you're a really great listener.
Most guys I go outwith, they just talk and talk.
After a while, it's like, "Shut your mouth." You know?
I've probably been talking too much. Why don't we talk about you?
Come on, I want to know.
Okay. I'm from Long Island.
I came to the city for college.
Um, I, uh, have a 5-year-old son, and in my spare time...
...I like to read spy novels. But let's talk more about you. Hmm?
So what's really neat. if you sear the stems of the flowers first in a frying pan...
...your arrangement will look fresh much longer.
Joey, that is such a great tip.
Monica, can you excuse us? I need to talk to the girl with the flowers.
Okay, but, Joey, come over later.
I'm gonna teach you how to make a bird feeder...
...out of just a pine cone and some peanut butter.
Aw. I love birds.
What is the matter with you?
What? You're arranging flowers.
You got dead flowers.
You've got a picture of a baby dressed like flowers.
This is not Joey.
Hey, hey, look, I am still Joey, okay?
Flowers, they're just, you know, nice to look at.
And that happens to be a picture by a famous artist of a famous baby.
You're turning into a woman.
No, I'm not.
Why would you say that? That's just mean.
Now I've upset you? What did I say?
It's not what you said. It's the way you said it.
Oh, my God.
I'm a woman.
So now she thinks that I made out with him and that I did it to get her job.
Why didn't you just tell the truth? I did.
but she doesn’t think anyone would be stupid enough to confuse Kenny the copy guy with Ralph Lauren.
Well, hey, what if Kenny were the real brains behind the whole company?
You know. What if Kenny hired that Ralph guy to be the pretty front man, huh?
Did she ever think of that?
You were with Kenny today, weren't you?
Just for a second. Ugh.
Phoebe, what am I gonna do? Well...
The only thing you can do. Sleep with Ralph Lauren.
I'm not gonna sleep with Ralph Lauren. I mean, I could, but I wouldn't.
Ooh. Sleep with Kenny.
That wouldn't help me. Oh, yes, it would.
I've had a really good time tonight. Mm-hm.
You know, I rarely connect with someone this much on the first date.
Me neither.
Uh, I've had a really good time too, you know.
Are you gonna eat that bread?
Oh, I just like the smell.
You make me laugh.
Would you like to move over to the couch?
Mm-hm.
Maybe I'll just turn down the lights a little?
How about all the way?
0Kay.
Wow, cool poster.
Or should I say, "groovy poster"?
So, uh...
...where were we?
Are those your teeth?
Oh.
You can see them, huh?
Yes. They're insanely white.
I did that for you.
What's the matter with you?
What's the matter with me? You've got a black light. It's 1999.
Oh, good. Kim, hi.
Hi, Rachel. Oh. I wanted to ask you, have you seen the new Ralph Lauren sheets?
What am I thinking? Of course you have.
Okay, look.
I'm sorry that I lied to you before.
You were right. Ralph and I were an item, but we're not anymore.
Oh, really?
Yeah, he dumped me.
He said, "Rachel, I can't do this.
Even though you're a very, very...
...very beautiful woman...
...I can't do this. I'm married and I'm sorry."
And I don't know why, but he said, "And you will never get promoted...
...especially not above Kim, who is an integral cog...
...in the Ralph Lauren machine."
You expect me to believe--
Hi, Ralph. Hi, Kim.
Oh, my God.
He just gave you the coldest look I've ever seen. It's like he hates you.
Then it is true.
Of course it's true. And it hurts so bad.
Oh, honey, come here.
Oh, it'll be okay.
We've all been there.
You and Ralph?
Kenny the copy boy.
Hey. Hey.
Uh, I need to talk to you. What's the matter? You upset?
I'm sorry, but we gotta get rid of all this girlie stuff in here.
I, uh-I gotta be a man.
Okay? The living room has to remain a guy place, okay?
That's just the way it has to be.
If that's what you want, I'll just put it all in my room.
Good. Great.
And, uh, thanks for being so understanding.
I didn't want to make a big deal out of this. you know.
But you could, uh, put the picture of the famous baby in my room.
I mean, if you want to.
0Kay.
And, uh, maybe the watering can there.
Sure.
And a couple of these little tiny boxes.
Joey, do you want me to put it all in your room?
0Kay.
Okay, great. Bye.
So guess who's coming to Thanksgiving dinner.
Sidney Poitier? Ha, ha.
I miss Rachel.
No, my parents.
Oh, That’s great, they haven't seen the place since I moved in.
Yeah, and y'know, if you could not mention that we live together, that'd be great.
I was thinking we'd eat around 4.
Why can't I tell them we live together?
Because they don't know we're dating. Do you think we should eat in the kitchen? 
Why haven't you told them?
Um, well, I was going to. I really was.
But, urn, then somewhere, just out of nowhere, I didn't.
Why haven't you told them? Wouldn't they be happy?
So, dinner in the kitchen around 4. I'll see you then.
Why wouldn't they be happy?
Well, um, because...
...mainly, um...
...they don't like you.
I'm sorry. What? Why? Why?
Maybe because you used to be aloof...
...or that you're really sarcastic or that you joke around all the time...
...or that you take off your clothes and throw them on the couch.
Is this why they don't like me or why you don't like me?
I know I should have told them. I know I shouldn't care what they think.
I'm sorry.
You know, it'll be okay, because when they come over, I will be charming.
I will make them love me, then we'll tell them.
You really think that'll work?
Hey, I can be pretty charming, babe. I won you over, didn't I?
I don't think you'll ever get my parents that drunk.
Friends  S06E09  The One Where Ross Got High
Hey. Oh, good, Ross. Your parents like me, right?
Yes, of course they like you.
Monica told me they don't.
Yeah, they don't like you.
Do you know why?
Maybe it's because you're really sarcastic, or maybe it's because you--
If people don't know, they shouldn't just guess.
This is great, Another Thanksgiving with nothing to give thanks for.
Maybe I could give thanks for you shutting up, huh?
Maybe I give thanks by taking my PlayStation to my new apartment.
Maybe I love you.
Hi. Hi.
Hey, guys.
No, I don't want to play video games, Joey.
Are you guys going to Chandler's for Thanksgiving?
Yeah, why, what's up?
Well, me and my dancer friends are thinking of doing Thanksgiving uptown.
I thought you guys might like to come.
For real?
No, but you should go to Chandler's. Because none of us knows how to cook,
We'll probably just drink all day.
We go to yours. Yeah.
Yeah, see, we have to stop across the hall because it's my sister.
But, you know, actually, uh, growing up with a sister was nice...
...because it really helped me understand women.
Yeah, you should tell your friends that.
0Kay.
How you got three women to marry you, I'll never know.
Hey. Hey.
Pheebs, check it out. For my dessert...
...I have chosen to make a traditional English trifle.
Wow, that sounds great. And what are you making, Monica?
In case Rachel's dessert is so good that I eat all of it...
...and there's none left for anybody else.
Nothing.
Nothing?
No, sweetie. I trust you.
So if I mess this up, there's nothing else for dessert?
You're not gonna mess it up.
Wow, Monica, I love that. You really have faith in me. Thank you.
Technical question: How do you know when the butter is done?
Well, it's done about two minutes before it looks like that.
Hey. Hey.
Oh. The food smells great, Mon. And the place looks so nice.
Hey, happy Thanksgiving, everybody. Happy Thanksgiving.
Happy Thanksgiving.
Well, this has been great. See you.
Where you going? Oh, oh.
We did say we'd stop by this little thing Joey's roommate is having.
Oh, Janine, the really hot dancer girl?
Some would say she's attractive, yes.
Who else is going to be there?
Uh, some of her friends. Her dancer friends?
Yes. All right?
All of her hot dancer friends are gonna be there...
...and they'll be drinking and dancing and we really want to go.
Dude, we were good.
You're not gonna go anywhere, You said you'd eat here and you'll eat here.
Yeah, and leaving us to go see hot dancer girls...
...is not very Thanksgiving-y.
Oh, but it is.
Uh, it's like the first Thanksgiving when the Indians and Pilgrims sat down.
Yeah, and then the Indians taught the Pilgrims...
...what it meant to be hot in the New World.
Hello, everybody. Hi.
Hi, Dad. Morn.
Look. Look who it is. It's Chandler.
Oh, yes, of course. Hello, Chandler.
Mr. and Mrs. Geller, you look wonderful.
It is great to have you here. Let us take your coats.
Whoa, it snowing out there?
No.
Monica, all this food looks wonderful.
You should think about doing this for a living.
Okay, I have dandruff. There's no need to laugh and point.
Dad, Chandler was laughing at yourjoke.
My joke wasn't funny.
Rach, I just remembered.
I had a dream about Mr. Geller last night.
Really?
Yeah. I dreamt that he saved me from a burning building...
...and he was so brave and so strong.
And it's making me look at him totally differently.
You know, I mean, he used to be just "Jack Geller, Monica and Ross' dad."
Now he's "Jack Geller, dream hunk."
I don't know. To me, he'll always be "Jack Geller...
...walks in while you're changing."
You know, Dad, Chandler is one of Ross' very best friends.
Ross sure is a great guy.
You know, I've always felt that how a young man turns out...
...is a reflection on his father.
I always thought that too. Tell me, what does your father do?
He's a headliner of a...
...gay burlesque show.
Rash, you're killing us. Will you serve the dessert already?
There's drunken dancers a-waiting.
Look at it. Isn't it beautiful?
Yeah. What is it?
It's a trifle. It's got all these layers.
First there's a layer of ladyfingers, then a layer of jam...
...then custard, which I made from scratch...
...then raspberries, more ladyfingers...
...then beef sauteed with peas and onions...
...then a little bit more custard...
...then bananas and then I put whipped cream on top.
What was the one right before bananas?
The beef. Yeah, that was weird to me too.
But then, y'know, I thought, "Well, there's minced meat pie."
That's an English dessert.
These people just put very strange things in their food.
By the way, can I borrow rum from your place?
Yeah, sure.
And while I'm gone, don't you boys sneak a taste.
okay. okay
Beef in a dessert?
No, no, no. There is no way.
I know. And only one layer of jam?
What is up with that?
Oh, my God.
The pages are stuck together. Chandler.
Oh, my God. She made half an English trifle and...
...half a shepherd's pie.
Man, now she's gonna start all over.
We're never gonna get to introduce the hot girls to the New World.
No, no, we will. We just won't tell her she messed up.
Just let her serve the beef-custard thing?
Yeah. It'll be like a funny Thanksgiving story.
Vomiting stories are funny, I guess.
Joey. God, your apartment is like a hundred degrees.
Did it make you want to walk around in your underwear?
No.
Still not hot enough.
Rachel. Okay, look at him.
Look at those strong hands.
Oh, what I wouldn't give to be that can of condensed milk.
Mom, uh, Chandler was just saying how beautiful your sweater is.
Oh, thank you, Chandler. I just bought it.
Oh. Yes, well, it's very beautiful and it's cream-colored and tight and...
I don't mean tight. It's not too tight. Not that I was looking at...
What's the matter with him?
I think he's stoned again.
What? What?
Dude, I need to talk to you a sec.
Okay, I think I might know why my parents don't like you.
You do? Why? Okay, remember we were young. Heh.
Spring break, sophomore year, I got high in my bedroom...
...and my parents walked in and smelled it...
...so I told them that you had gotten stoned and jumped out the window.
What? Why did you do that?
I don't know. Uh, yours was the first name that popped into my head.
I'm sorry. I didn't think it'd matter.
How could it not matter?
How was I to know we'd be friends after college...
...let alone you'd be living with my sister?
What about all that "friends forever" stuff?
I don't know. I was all high.
Mom and Dad just sent me to find out if you were trying to get Ross stoned.
Your parents caught Ross smoking pot in college, and he blamed it on me.
Ross, I can't believe you'd do that.
We haven't told them we're together because they hate me, okay? So you fix this.
Okay, okay, I'll tell them it wasn't Chandler who got high.
Now, who should I say it was?
You. It's not like it's a big deal. You don't still do it or anything.
All right. Now, who should I say tricked me into doing it?
Dad.
Dad, please don't pick your teeth out here.
And if you're gonna put your feet up-Monica, leave him alone.
Will you hurry up?
Did you not hear me when I told you that all of Janine's friends are dancers?
Huh? And that they're gonna be drinking a lot?
No, I did. But tell me again because it's so romantic.
You're whipping so slow. Can't you do it any faster?
Joey, come on, I don't want to make any mistakes.
This is the only dessert. If I screw it up, everybody's gonna be like:
"Oh, remember that Thanksgiving when Rachel screwed up the trifle?"
So just let me worry about making the trifle and you just worry about eating it.alright?
Oh, I am.
Ross, if you don't tell them, then I will. Okay. Fine.
Ross, can I talk to you for a second? Oh, uh...
Can it wait a second, Joey? I have to tell my parents something.
No, it can't? Okay.
Okay, look, I think we have to tell Rachel she messed up her dessert.
What? What is with everybody?
It's Thanksgiving, not...
...Truth Day.
Look, when everyone eats that banana-meat thing...
...they'll all make fun of her. Do you want that?
Okay. We'll just get everyone to act like they like it.
That way, no one makes fun of her...
...and we still get to go to sweet potato pie.
Dude, they're not objects.
Oh.
Just kidding. I'll talk to them. You distract her.
Hey, Rach, can I talk to you outside for a sec'?
0Kay.
What's up, Ross?
So, um...
Thanksgiving.
The holiday season is upon us, hmm?
Yeah.
And, um...
...you look nice today.
Oh, no. No, Ross, don't do this. What?
I just don't think us getting back together is a good idea.
Huh?
I thought this might happen today.
Ross, I know the holidays can be rough...
...and it's probably really hard for you to be alone right now.
You're alone.
No, I live with Phoebe.
I mean, you're alone-alone.
And it's just not the time for us. I'm sorry.
Oh, well. Can't blame a guy for trying.
And, uh, if anyone needs help pretending to like it...
...I learned some things in acting class. Try, uh, rubbing your stomach.
Or, uh, saying "Mm."
And, uh, oh, smiling.
Okay?
Yeah, I'm not gonna pay for those acting classes anymore.
Rachel, there you are. Come on, Let's serve that dessert already.
Joey, you have to stop rushing me. You know what? You don't get any dessert.
Really?
No, just kidding. I would never do that to you.
Okay, everybody, it's trifle time.
So, now, Rach, this is a traditional English trifle, isn't it?
It sure is. Wow.
So did you make it with beef or eggplant?
Beet I can't have any. I don't eat meat. Oh.
Aw.
Monica, I want you to have the first taste.
Really?
Wait, you only got whipped cream.
You gotta take a bite with all the layers.
0Kay.
You dropped a pea.
Well?
Mm.
It's good.
Really? How good?
It's so good that I feel really selfish...
...about being the only one who's eating it.
I think we should have everyone taste how good it is.
Especially Ross.
Yeah. This is so good that I'm gonna go enjoy it on the balcony.
So that I can enjoy the view whilst I enjoy my dessert.
I've gotta call my friend...
...and tell her how good this is from Monica's room.
I'll help you dial.
I'm gonna go into the bathroom...
...so I can look at it in the mirror as I eat it.
Okay, what was that all about? Does it not taste good?
Let me try it. No, no.
All gone.
So good.
Maybe Chandler has some left.
It tastes like feet.
I like it.
Are you kidding?
What's not to like? Custard, good.
Jam, good. Meat, good.
So a bird just grabbed it...
...and then tried to fly away with it...
...and then just dropped it on the street?
Yes, but, if it's any consolation, before the bird dropped it...
...he seemed to enjoy it.
Rachel, come here.
0Kay.
I was just taking my Thanksgiving nap and I had another dream about Jack.
Phoebe, do I want to hear this? I don't know, let's see.
Okay, I dreamt we were getting married...
...and he left because he had to go fight a fire.
And, um, so, okay, I went to a nightclub and I saw him making outwith a girl.
Oh, my God, he dream-cheated on you.
Yeah. But then Jacques Cousteau came...
...and he kicked his ass for betraying me.
It was so cool.
Then he took me diving and introduced me to his pet sea horse...
...who was coming on to me. And, please, that is not gonna happen.
Boy, I'm glad I wore the big belt today.
Five minutes ago, a line like that would have floored me.
But now, nothing. Well, not nothing. I am still a woman.
Ross? Let's go.
Oh, yeah. About telling Mom and Dad...
...I was thinking about maybe writing a letter.
You know what? That's it. You've had your chance.
Mom, Dad. Ross smoked pot in college.
What? What?
You are such a tattletale.
Mom, Dad, heh...
...you remember that time you walked in my room...
...and smelled marijuana?
Yes. Yes.
I told you it was Chandler...
...who was smoking the pot but...
...it was me. I'm sorry.
It was you?
And, Dad, you know that mailman that you got fired?
He didn't steal your Playboys. Ross did.
Well, Hurricane Gloria didn't break the porch swing. Monica did.
Ross hasn't worked at the museum for a year.
Monica and Chandler are living together!
Ross married Rachel in Vegas. And got divorced. Again!
I love Jacques Cousteau.
I wasn't supposed to put beef in the trifle.
I want to go!
That's a lot of information to get in 3O seconds.
All right. Joey, if you want to leave, just leave.
Rachel, no, you weren't supposed to put beef in the trifle.
It did not taste good.
Phoebe, I'm sorry...
...but I think Jacques Cousteau is dead.
Monica, why you felt you had to hide the fact...
...that you're in an important relationship is beyond me.
And we kind of figured about the porch swing.
Ross.
Drugs?
Divorced again?
What happened, son?
L-I, uh-I got tricked into all those things.
Chandler, you've been Ross' best friend all these years...
...stuck by him during the drug problems...
...and now you've taken on Monica as well.
Well, I don't know what to say.
You're a wonderful human being.
Thank you. No.
Thank you.
Monica and Ross, I don't know what I'm gonna do about the two of you.
I'll talk to them.
You guys, it was bananas...
...cream and beef.
I just cannot believe that you ate that so that I wouldn't feel bad.
Well, actually, I didn't eat mine. It's still in the bathroom.
No it isn't, I ate that.
And we left ours in Monica's bedroom.
Nope, got it and got yours too.
Let me ask you, Why is everybody using these tiny, little lights nowadays?
I remember when people used big lights.
That's a good story, Grandpa.
Hey. Hey.
Wow. Monica's letting other people help decorate her tree?
Did someone get her drunk again, or...?
Having a perfectly decorated tree is not what Christmas is about.
It's about being with the people that you love.
That is nice. And we're done. Ta-da!
I dunno what it is, It just doesn't quite feel like Christmas to me.
Oh, here.
See, now it feels like Christmas.
Friends  S06E10  The One With The Routinue
And that's the story of the dreidel.
Now, Some people trace the Christmas tree back to the Egyptians...
...who'd bring palm branches into huts on the shortest day of the year...
...symbolizing life's triumph over death.
And that was, like, 4000 years ago.
So, pretty much around the same time that you started telling this story.
Hey, you guys. Hey. What's up?
I had to get out of the apartment. Janine's stretching all over the place.
Everywhere I look she's like...
I can see why that's hard to resist.
I like her so much.
Aw, I'm sorry sweetie that she doesn’t feel the same way.
I know. And she's so sweet.
I just want to feed her grapes and brush her hair.
You are aware that she's not a monkey, right?
I am so over Janine.
I mean, Yeah, at first I thought she was hot, but now she's like old news.
Hey, guys. Janine!
I'm gonna be a dancer on a TV special for New Year's Eve.
It's called some sort of Dickin' Rockin' Dicky Eve.
Hold it.
Are you talking about Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve?
Yeah, that's what I said.
Oh, my God, we love that show!
Ross and I have been watching it since I can remember.
Ah, you're still just a little fat girl inside, aren't you?
Well I'm gonna be on it this year. I'm gonna be one of the party people.
You're gonna be a party person? Those guys rock the most!
Well they said to bring someone. Do you wanna be my dance partner?
Totally! I would love to spend New Year's with you.
Well actually they're taping tomorrow. I don't understand why--
Well, how it works is...
...the part with Dick Clark in Times Square is actually live.
But they tape some of the party stuff ahead of time.
Yeah, Not a lot of people know that.
Do you guys want to come too?
Are you serious? We are there!
What are you laughing at?
Well, I used to date him, but you're still going outwith her.
Thanks. Great, so we can all go together.
I gotta run. catch you later.
Bye, Janine.
Did she just ask me out on a date?
I don't think so.
What are you talking about? She invited him to the biggest party of the millennium.
Yeah, but she also invited you and Ross.
Yeah, honey, I'm sorry, I don't think that that was a romantic thing.
Well, maybe. But, hey, I know how I can find out.
We're going to a New Year's Eve party, right? 
So at midnight, I can kiss her. And if she kisses me back, great.
If she says, "Dude, what the hell are you doing?"
I can say, "it wasn't me, it was New Year's."
Well, that's a lot better than Ross kissing me in high school...
...and saying that he did it because he needed Chap Stick.
It was a dry day.
We are going to Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Okay, I've been on sets before...
...so let me give you a little advice, alright?
It's a show, but we're just dancing. It's no big deal.
Important thing to remember: Stay cool.
Got it. Okay.
Oh, my God! It's just like I dreamed it!
Everyone! Gather up!
Excuse us! Excuse us!
Here's what's gonna happen.The music's gonna start, you're gonna dance...
...we'll tape it. Don't look at the camera. Any questions?
Uh, yeah, I have a question. Uh, when is this gonna air?
Yeah. Now, uh, you guys dance over there...
...you guys, over there. and I want you two right around here,
And everyone else, spread out. Ross.
So when is it gonna air?
Okay, you look in the kitchen, I will look in the back closet.
I can save you time, ladies. I'm right here.
Yeah. Chandler why don't you take a walk? This doesn't concern you.
We're looking for our presents from Monica.
 What? That's terrible!
No-no, we do it every year!
Oh, well, that makes it not terrible.
No, yeah, we never find them.
She's always best at us that wily minx.
Don't worry, we're just gonna search here for an hour..
...and then we'll go to Joey's and search, okay?
No not okay, You can't look for Monica's presents.But we have to!
No, you don’t have to, And you can't, because I live here too.
Well, then you should look with us.
Why?
Chandler, Aren't you worried about what to get Monica for Christmas?
No, I have a great idea for a present for her.
Oh, that's it? A great idea? Oh, yeah?
Chandler, that's not enough. I mean what if she gets you a great present...
...two medium presents, and a bunch of little presents?
And you've just gotten her one great present? I mean that's just gonna make her feel bad.
Why would you do that to her Chandler? Why? Why?
If I help, we can find them faster! That's right!
Ooh! Ooh! We have a live one!
Oh, it's a Macy's bag! Yeah.
Aw! Ooh! Who's it for?
"Dear Losers, do you really think I'd hide presents under the couch?
P.S. Chandler, I knew they'd break you."
Uh-oh. She may be onto us.
We are so gonna find them this year.
Y'know when you guys said you were gonna go across the hall and look. you don’t, you don’t do that every year do you?
Yeah.
You don't, like go into the back of my closet...
...and look under my gym bag or anything?
No. Never do that.
Because that's where Joey gave me some stuff to store that I've never seen before in my life! 
Okay, that did not just happen.
Okay, here comes another camera.
Right. No biggie. Stay loose.
Why do they keep doing that? Ugh!
If we wanna get on camera, I think we have to get up on one of those platforms. 
They've been taping those people up there all day.
Right.
Hey, what'd you guys do to get up on there?
We learned how to dance.
Oh yeah? Well when you learned how to dance did you forget how to put on underpants?
Yeah!
Hey, you're a good dancer. Really?
Yeah, well you’d be better if you just loosened your hips a little.
What do you mean? Like this.
That's it. Feel the rhythm. That's better.
Okay, you’re dancing with that girl over there.
No-no-no-no-no we're together. Yeah, we came together.
I don't see it.
You are dancing with the tall guy over there. Tall Guy, raise your hand!
No-no hey buddy, please let me dance with that girl, I really like her and I think I have a shot..
Really, you think so? I don't.
I couldn't find anything at Joey--Hey-hey, oh hey!
Yeah, we found them.
They were in the guest room closet behind some coats.
Yeah, and you have nothing to worry about 'cos they're all crap!
Those are my gifts, I got them for you.
Oh. Thanks, Chandler, they're great!
Well Chandler, what is this very weird, urn, metal A-Z thing?
Those are book ends. That's a great gift.
Oh. Okay, I'm sorry. Thank you for my "az."
Make sure you put all that stuff back in the closet. okay.
Yes, okay.
By the way, I just gotta say, I think it's really nice of you that even after you moved...
...you still keep storing that stuff for Joey.
Hey, dancing girl?
Can I go to the bathroom?
Here we go. Yeah.
Looking good, Gellers!
We know!
Hey, see that snippy guy over there? He's the one who decides who gets up on the platform.
We should go dance by him. Okay.
Okay, everybody, hold!
Next on the platforms are...
You two! And... Yes!
You two! Cool!
Excuse me? Sir?
Would it help if I weren't wearing underpants? Monica! 
Would it?
Hey, Tall Guy!
listen, I want to talk to you about that girl you're dancing with.
She's nice, huh? To think I almost brought my wife to this.
Yeah. Yeah. Okay.
Uh, look buddy, I came with that girl, okay?
and I had this plan to kiss her at the new years countdown.
I'm trying to win her over. you know--
No I don’t think so.
Oh come on man, you can dance with my partner.
she's real, uh, mellow!
Look, are you dating this girl you came with?
I was hoping after tonight that maybe I could you know...
No. No. She's fair game if you ask me. Sorry, buddy.
All right. Hey.
y'know fair is fair,if you're right, you're right, what can I say,
but hey oh no!
Are you in second grade?
Hey, man. You're the one who wet his pants.
Hey!
Man, this sucks.
If Mom and Dad don't see us on TV after we made them jealous...
...then who's gonna be the losers then?
Hey, I know what'll get us up on a platform. What?
The routine!
Ross, we haven't done the routine since middle school.
Hey, when the snippy guy sees the routine...
...he'll want to build us our own platform.
Was it that good?
We got honorable mention in the brother-sister dance category!
It's almost fake midnight. Do we really have any other choice?
Okay, let's do it.
Mom and Dad are gonna be so faced!
Five, six, seven, eight!
So do we really need to ask who's going up on the platform next?
Oh no! You get up there and do that again, exactly like that.
Yeah! Ooh!
Make sure you get this, they’re gonna want it for the bloopers show.
All right, cut! Listen up, everyone!
When we start, it'll be the countdown to new years...
...so I want to see everybody's excitement!
Hey, guy!
You got three seconds to get away from my partner.
What’s going on over here?
Take a look at the guy's pants!
I mean, I know you told us to show excitement, but don't you think he went a little overboard?
What's the matter with you?  Get out of here!
Yeah, take a hike, wet pants!
Can you believe this?
We're gonna be on the platform for the Millennium moment!
I know!
Hey, you haven't been practicing the routine, have you?
No.
Me too!
When the music starts up again...
...I was thinking of maybe goind into the robot, y'know?
Ross? We should stick to the routine. We don't want to look stupid.
All right, we're back! Ten seconds left here we go!
Ten. Nine, eight, seven.
Okay, it all comes down to this.
Whatever happens, happens.
Destiny.
three, two, one!
"Cut! “No!
Year!
Happy No Year!
Okay, here's where we go to the live shot of Times Square,nice work everyone that's a wrap!
Hey, look who I found.
On, hi, guys!
Y'know, Birds have a very good sense of direction.
and I thought maybe they could help us find where the presents are hidden.
Yes, if the presents are hidden south for the winter.
Or we could just follow your clever jokes. Any ideas? Didn't think so.
Come on, show us where the presents are.
Oh, the duck seems to think that Monica got me garbage.
I wonder what I could get Monica that's as good as garbage.
Hmm. How about my “at”?
Hey. This is hollow. What?
This bench, it's hollow. I can't believe I never knew that!
Oh, the presents! Don't look directly at them!
What?
All right, no, we could look at them.
This one's for me!
This one's for Chandler. Here.
And the big one's for me! Oh, let's open them!
Wait a minute. We can't do this. Why?
I don't want to know what Monica got me.Y'know? I mean,look.
I'm sure she worked hard at getting it and wanting to surprise me.
And you guys are gonna ruin that.and I,
look we have to put them back. this is not what Christmas is about.
Whatever, Linus. I'm opening mine.
Nobody is opening anything, okay?
I want to see the look on Monica's face when I give her my present.
I'm sure she wants to see the look on my face when I get mine.
So, please, please, can we just...? Can we put them back?
Will you get us better gifts? Fine.
Hey, guys.
You found the presents?
Chandler, you let them find the presents?
Great.
Do you know how long it took me to find you that water purifier?
That's what you got me? Yes, I see. That look is priceless.
Home sweet home, huh?
Nice to, uh, get back to reality.
Plus, we, uh, know how the New Year's gonna go off.
I guess there's no reason for all that Y2K panic, you know?
Anyway, good night.
Joey? Yeah?
Three...
...two, one.
Happy New Year.
What was that for?
Tonight when they yelled "cut" and we didn't get to kiss...
...I was really, really disappointed, and I just...
I just really wanted to kiss you.
Really?
In the moment, I really wanted to kiss you too. In the moment.
In the moment. But only in the moment.
So do you, uh, want to kiss again?
Sure. New Year's Eve is only two weeks away.
Can you wait?
No.
Me neither.
Three, two...
Joey, you don't have to count down every time we kiss.
Oh. Okay.
Except I sort of felt like I needed a couple seconds to get ready.
We were on the platform, ready to dance into the new millennium...
...and the guy yells "cut!"
So you guys are telling me that you actually did...
...the routine from eighth grade?
Yeah! But of course we had to update it a little bit.
Hey, by the way, quick thinking about catching me.
‘Cos I was gonna say there's no way you could've done the end...
...the way you guys did it back then.
What? We could do it.
I don't know. You were a lot bigger-I mean, stronger back then.
I can do it, okay?
Come on, let's go! Come on.
One, two, three, four...
...five, six, seven, eight.
I can't do it! Ahh!
Now, you do that, you're on TV.
Hey.
Hey. Hey.
Listen, uh...
do you guys think I have a chance with Janine?
Honey, we have been through this before!
Yeah. Don't do this to yourself.
She’s made it pretty clear, it is not going to happen.
All right, then. I guess I shouldn't get too excited about the fact...
...that I just kissed her!
Are you serious? That's great!
Yeah, well, we'll see.
You kissed her?
Oh, we kissed it up real nice.
So you kissed her, What happened after that?
I came over here to tell you guys.
So she's just waiting over there for ya?
Yeah.
Friends  S06E11  The One With The Apothecary Table
I gotta go. Okay
I'm gonna be really late for dance class!
0Kay.
Okay, now I'm really leaving. Okay, I'm all right.
But can you just...
...just leave your lips?
Bye. Bye.
Have you kissed her yet?
It's awesome!
I could do it forever.
You know what? She kisses better than my mom cooks.
I'm so glad you said "cooks." Right?
Oh hey Rachel, sweetheart? you've got to tell the post office that you've moved.
Okay? We are still getting all your bills and stuff.
Oh! Oh! Pottery Barn! You can throw the rest away.
I'm not your garbage man.
I'm your mailman.
Monica, look! Look-look-look!
Here is that table that I ordered. Ah!
You got it from Pottery Barn? Yeah. It's an apothecary table.
Does anyone even know what an apothecary is?
A pharmacist.
A pharmacist.
Rach, Phoebe hates Pottery Barn.
I hate Pottery Barn too.
They kicked me out just because I sat on a bed.
You took off your pants and got under the sheets.
I was tired.
Phoebe hates Pottery Barn?
Yeah, she hates all mass produced stuff.
She thinks her furniture should have a history, a story behind it.
Well this has a story behind it.
I mean they had to ship it all the way from the White Plains store.
It’s gotta be one of a kind.
Y'know like umm, y'know uh, what's that God awful ceramic fruit bowl she has on her counter?
Hey! I made that for her.
You made pottery? Yeah.
I made it out of a fruit bowl I found in the garbage.
I'm telling -- If you put that in her apartment, you'll never hear the end of it.
Okay fine! I'll-I'll just tell her that it's an antique apothecary table.
She doesn't have to know where it came from.
Ah, I love these drawers.
Oh, look! It says that it holds 300 CDs.
Ah, just like the apothecary tables of yore.
So the farmer says:
"That's not a cow, and you're not milking."
I am so glad you guys got together,
Chandler and I are always looking for a couple to go out with and now we have one.
We're a couple of couples.
I had so much fun tonight. What a great restaurant!
And Chandler, I can't believe I let you pay for this one.
Thanks again, man.
So do you guys gonna come over tomorrow? I'll make that pasta thing I was telling you about.
That'd be great! Okay.
Oh, but hey look, at least let us bring the wine.
Joey, you don't have too! Ah, I insist.
You'll get the wine, right? Yeah.
Okay, good night. See you tomorrow.
Can't wait.
How are we going to get out of that one?
What? I can't handle two nights in a row...
...with them.
What-what’s wrong with Monica and Chandler?
I don’t know, they're just a little...
...blah!
Blah?
Well, you know, he's blah. She's just...
She's very loud for such a small person.
Uh, they're my best friends.
Are you saying we can't hang out with them? 'Cause that'd be a problem.
No! Of course we can still hang out with them.
Just y'know, not two nights in a row.
Okay? I guess.
Thank you.
If you want, I'll sell my friends and use the money to buy you presents.
Hey. Hey.
Ooh! What a great table! Where did you get it?
Guess.
Um, a flea market?
Ha, See, I knew, I knew you would get it on the first guess.
Isn't it cool? It's an apothecary table.
Wow!
Oh you can just imagine that this is where...
...they kept all their stuff to make potions.
You know? Ooh, yes.
Ooh, you can almost smell the opium.
Almost.
Oh, how much was it?
Just only 500 bucks.
500 bucks at a flea market?
Oh, okay see I thought,I thought you meant how much was it...
...when it was new, y'know like back then
Oh, no. Yeah, no.
I mean it was at a flea market, so it was y'know, it was like a dollar.
A dollar? And fifty?
So it was like one and fifty dollars.
Ohh, okay, they gave you the old-time pricing. Yeah.
Well, what period is it from?
Uh, it's from yore.
Like, the "days of yore," you know?
Yes, I do.
It's just perfect. Oh, good.
Wow! I bet it has a great story behind it too.
Did they tell you anything? Like y’know where it was from or...
Yes, that I know. This is from, uh, White Plains.
White Plains. Mm-hm.
Ooh, it sounds like such a magical place.
Hey! I'm here. Hi!
Oh, my God!
You like it? Oh, my God!
It's my new apothecary table!
Ross! Phoebe'll be here any second. She can't see this.
Well why not?! She'll love it. It's the real thing.
I got it at Pottery Barn.
I know you did! I bought the same one.
And if she sees your table she's gonna know that I lied to her. 
I told her ours was an original. Why did you do that?
Because she hates Pottery Barn.
She hates Pottery Barn?
I know! I know, She says it's all mass-produced...
...nothing is authentic, and everyone winds up having the same stuff.
So come on! she's gonna be here any second! Can we please just cover this up with something?! Please?
What? No, no.
I am not gonna hide it from Phoebe.
Although I did get some great Pottery Barn sheets.
Ooh, I forgot they made sheets!
Heh, yeah.
I still can't believe she hates Pottery Barn.
Ross, get over it! It's not like she hates you.
Yeah, but Pottery Barn?
You know what I think? It's just she-she's weird.
Y’know it’s because she's a twin. Twins are weird.
Ross, she's not weird. She just wants her stuff to be one-of-a-kind.
Huh. You know what's not one-of-a-kind? A twin!
Ooh, Phoebe's here! Okay, let's turn out the lights and watch the movie.
Okay. Hey, ooh, cool sheet! You like it?
You want to know where I got it? Sure.
At a flea market.
You buy your sheets at a flea market?
Ross come on, you gotta loosen the purse strings a little.
Hey. Hey.
The dinner will be ready in 20 minutes. This is so exciting.
And here is the bottle of wine for you to bring over tonight.
You were also gonna buy Monica flowers...
...but you couldn't afford it,because you paid for dinner last night.
Thanks. But, uh, it's just gonna be me tonight.
What happened to Janine? She's, uh, really sick.
That's too bad. Yeah, she's been in there all day.
Uh, high fever, nose problem. It's...
Phlegm, phlegm, phlegm, phlegm, phlegm.
Monica! Chandler!
I'm really-really sorry about tonight. I don't know if Joey told you...
...I just couldn't get out of going to this play. I'm sorry.
Have a great time, huh?
That's funny, I saw no phlegm.
Oh, no, she really is sick.
Then why is she going to a play?
Uh, well, you know, "Starve a fever...
...go to a play for a cold."
Joey! Why is Janine not coming over for dinner?
Uh, she didn't want to hang out with you guys two nights in a row.
I'm so sorry.
Why doesn't she want to hang out with us?
Because she, uh, she-she thinks that you are "blah."
And that, uh, you, Monica, are too loud.
What?!
What?
So she was just pretending to have a good time last night? 
She was lying to our faces?
I can't believe this.
Who is she to judge us?
We couldn't have been nicer to her. And I am not "blah." I am a hoot!
I know, I know.
Come on, please, you guys. Don't be mad.
I'm sure she just, she just said that stuff ...
because she was nervous and you guys are like my best friends!
Y’know? And it was our first date.
Plus, she's really sick.
No, you sh—No you said you made that up!!
I know, but don't you think the "sick" thing is way better than the "play" thing?
Eh, they're both good. I generally just go with, "Monica's drunk again."
Come on you guys, please just give her another chance.
She'll come around, I promise. Of course we will.
Come on, we gotta make dinner. Okay.
I do not like that woman!
I can hear you!
I am loud!
Isn't it good?
Hey Pheebs, could you please not put your feet up on my new...
...old sheet.
Oh, sure.
My apothecary table!
What? No!
Ross, where did you get this? I got it at Pottery Barn!! Okay?!
Oh, my God! Phoebe,
Pottery Barn has ripped off the design of our antique!
Wow! Oh my God, well if they've ripped off our table...
...ours must be worth much more than one and fifty dollars.
Well this doesn’t even smell like opium.
Of course not, it smells like wine, which you spilled! 
And thanks for wrecking my sheet by the way.
Ross, calm down. I'll give you the 80 cents.
Okay, one more time.
Chandler, would you like some more orange juice?
Perfect decibel. I know!
Hey. Hey.
Uh, what are you guys doing?
Nothing. We're just talking. You know, blah-blah-blah.
Look, come on you guys, you said you were gonna try!
I came over here to invite you guys to a movie with me and Janine.
What do you say? I'd like to...
...but I'm not sure if we have the time.
Ha, very funny. I don't know what to do.
I really want you guys to get along.
Just please, come to the movie with us. I mean you owe me!
We owe you? That's right.
I helped you guys out a lot in the start of your relationship.
I helped you guys sneak around for like six months.
I looked like an idiot.
And I was humiliated.
And I only made $200.
We didn't give you any money.
You don't think I know that?
see I can't decide whether it would go better next to the new wicker dining chair..
...the Sahara desk...
...or the Parker console table.
Wow! I didn't know that there was a Pottery Barn up here.
I know, I know. I went a little crazy. A little?
Your place looks like page 72 of the catalog.
Look at that!
The ornamental birdcage! Large. Ha, ha.
Hey. Hey.
Oh, Ross? Be careful. That is very old.
Okay? Early Colonial bird merchants used to bring their birds to market in that.
Fascinating.
Another amazing find! Wow.
Oh I bet this has a great story too. It does.
It is a room-separating apparatus from Colonial times.
Huh, a lot of this stuff is from the Colonial times.
What are some other time periods, Rachel?
Well, there's yore.
Ahem, and, uh, you know, yesteryear.
Yeah no, I'm telling you Rachel has such a good eye for this stuff.
Ross, y'know if you ever decide to redecorate--
and I think you should--
you should ask Rachel to help.
Oh honey, he doesn't need my help.
Oh, come on! I think he's ready to get rid of the. What'd you call it?
The, uh, "cheap knockoffs and dinosaurjunk"?
Really?
You know, since you have such a great sense of what I need--
Uh, here's 60 bucks.
Why don't you take Phoebe down to that Colonial, uh, flea market...
...and get me some stuff?
Y'know what? I don't, I don't think Phoebe wants to come.
No! I do want to! She does want to.
She does want to. Yeah!
Pheebs, I don't know what to say.I guess the flea market was just better last time.
Well, at least I got these sheets for Ross. Yeah.
Ugh, look at this. Pottery Barn.
Ugh, yeah, you know what? Don't look at it.
Seriously, don't look at it. No! Look-look!
 There's the coffee table they stole from us.
Oh, those bastards! Let's go.
That fan kind of looks like ours, and the birdcage, and...
Wait a second, this is our exact living room!
 No! No it’s not! 
No it’s not! Come on, Phoebe, ours is totally different.
I mean, we don't have the - We don't have the…that lamp! .
And-and that screen is y'know, on the other side.
Oh, my God. This is where you got all our stuff.
Pottery Barn! Oh, my God! No. no.
Okay-okay look—no I did,, all right? I'm sorry.
I just wanted this stuff and I know how you feel about Pottery Barn.Just...
Come on don't be mad. No-no-no, but I am mad!I am mad!
Because this stuff is everything that is wrong with the world...
And it’s all sitting up in my living room...
...and all I can think about is how I don't have that lamp!
Well, then, honey, buy the lamp.
We have that 60 bucks from Ross.
I can't! I can't!
Unless...
Well are you saying that-that you would move out if-if I didn't buy that lamp?
No, I'm not gonna move out!
But are you saying that you would move out if I didn't buy that lamp?
Oh. Yes! I would so move out. Okay then I don't have a choice!
I have to buy that lamp! That's right.
But at least the apothecary table is real.
Well, this-this-this was great. Didn't everybody have a great time?
I did. I really did. And you guys, I've got to say...
I'm sorry if I was a little weird after the last time we went out.
I guess I was just nervous or something.
That’s totally understandable. Don't worry about it.
So we can go out again?
Oh yeah! Absolutely.
Okay, well, good night. Good night.
See,huh?
Wasn't that fun?
We have got to move.
What?
I knew it!
Y'know, you're not so quiet yourself, missy!
And I'm blah? Listen, The only thing more boring than watching modern dance...
...is having to listen to you talk about it.
"Oh, Chandler...
...I just lost myself in the movement."
You know, I know you're talking...
...but all I hear is blah-blah-blah-blah-blah.
All right, you and me! Let's go, right now!
All right! All right! Enough! Enough! 
Enough! Enough! You two, go home. I gotta talk to Janine.
Y'know I think you can take her.
You'd better hope I don't see you in the hallway!
All right. Uh...
we've got a little bit of a problem here.
These people are my friends; you can't treat them that way.
They said stuff to me too. I know, I know! I'll talk to them about it.
They mean so much to me.
They're like my family, you know?
If you guys are gonna be fighting all the time...
I don't think we can be together.It just, it just can't work,okay?
It can't.
I'm very upset.
0Kay. Okay.
Would, would it help if I went over and apologized?
Yeah! Yeah!
That would be very helpful! Yeah.
What did I tell you about the hall?
I was just coming over here to apologize for my behavior!
I'd really like it if we could be friends.
Well, I know that would make Joey happy, so...
...I would like that too.
Great. Now, come on.
Well, I'm glad we worked it out. Me too.
Okay. I'll see you. Bye.
Or I'll hear you. That's it, big girl.
Wait!
You'd better run!
Did you hear that? Yeah uh,
What am I gonna do? Yeah, I'm sorry man.
Want to go watch? Yeah!
Hey. Hey.
How you doing? So, uh, did she move out?
Pretty much, yeah.
I cannot believe you broke up with her just like that.
Well, When it's not right, you know it.
You okay? Yeah! Yeah. I'll be all right.
You know what'd cheer you up? What?
I'm giving this lecture on erosion theories tomorrow night.
I think you should come.
You're right, that did cheer me up.
Hey. You're not going to believe this.
I made up a joke and sent it in to Playboy.
They printed it. Yeah.
 I didn't know Playboy prints jokes.
Yeah, they print jokes, interviews, hard-hitting journalism.
It's not just about the pictures.
It didn't work on Mom, it's not gonna work on us.
Here, check it out. It's the first one too.
Right there.
Ha, ha.
That is funny.
It was also funny when I made it up.
What? I made that joke up.
Uh, Oh, Oh. No, you didn't. I did.
Uh, uh, oh. Yes, I did. I told Dan at work, and he said it was the funniest joke he'd ever heard.
Hey, tell Dan thanks.
What?
I'm sorry. I was just reading the joke below it. Man, that one is funny.
Monica, you remember me telling you that joke, right?
No. Seriously?
You tell a lot of jokes.
Look, Chandler, it's my joke.
But if it makes you feel any better, they don't print the name.
So it doesn't really matter who gets credit. right?
Yeah, I guess.
Hey, guys. Joey, Playboy printed my joke!
No, it's my joke, it's mine. giveing call them, they'll tell you.
My joke! My joke!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Jokes?
You guys know they have naked chicks in there, right?
Friends  S06E12  The One With The Joke
Dude! You have got to turn on Behind The Music.
The band Heart is having a really tough time and they may break up.
Let’s go watch it at your place.
Nah, Monica's watching some cooking show. Come on, I don't want to miss when they were skinny.
Hey, Chandler, Chandler. You know what we should do?
You and I should go out and get some new sunglasses.
What? No, I want to watch this.
Did your cable go out? No. No, that's VH1.
I gotta tell you, the music these kids listen to today...
...It's like a lotta noise to me. I don't know...
Joey, Why is your cable out?
Uh... Oh, because I haven't really paid the bill. Heh, heh.
If you need money, would you please-please let me loan you some money?
No, Chandler. Look, forget about it, okay?
I know things have been tight since Janine moved out. God, was she hot.
Whoa. I know, yeah.
Look, I can handle it, all right? I can listen to the radio.
And Ross gave me this great book.
All right, you want to see if the joke stealer will let us watch the show at his place?
Sure.
Paid your phone bill? Not so much.
Hey. Oh.
It's only you.
What are you doing? We are looking at a Playboy.
I want to look too!
Yikes!
So do you think these pictures are trying to tell a story?
Oh, yeah, sure. I mean, Like in the case of this young woman...
...she has lost her clothes.
So she rides naked on the horse, she's crying out, "Where are they? Where are they?"
Well, she's not going to find them, lying in the grass like that.
Oh. Yeah.
Remember the days when you'd go out to the barn...
...lift up your shirt and bend over? Yeah.
You see, now, I would date this girl.
She's cute, she's outdoorsy.
And she knows how to build a fire. That'll come in handy.
I got a question.
If you had to pick one of us to date, who would it be?
I don't know. Me neither.
Rachel.
What?
I don't know.
Me neither.
You know, you forget how many great songs Heart had.
Yeah.
You know, "Barracuda" was the first song I learned to play on the keyboard.
So you heard it, you repeated it...
...so that must mean you wrote it.
Oh, you guys with this joke. Well, I gotta say...
...I know I cracked up, but I'm not even sure I got it.
What?
You didn't get it?
The doctor is a monkey.
And monkeys can't write out prescriptions.
You are not allowed to laugh at my joke.
Your joke?
Well, I think "the Hef" would disagree.
Which is why he sent me a check...
...for $100.
So you stole my joke and you stole my money?
Well, I was gonna stick it in the ATM.
But now I think I'll show the sexy teller...
...that I am a published writer.
Well, she'll know that you stole the joke.
Oh, what are you going to do, follow me down there?
Yeah. I'm not gonna go now.
0Kay.
Here you go. Oh.
Ah.
Uh, Gunther?
I can't pay for this now, because I'm not working.
I've had to cut down on some luxuries like...
...paying for stuff, so...
Well, if you want, you can work here.
Uh, I don't know.
It's just...
See, I was a regular on a soap opera, you know?
And to go from that to this, it's just...
And plus, I'd have to wait on all my friends.
Okay. But the money's good.
Plus, you get to stare at Rachel as much as you want.
What?
Flexible hours.
Maybe I could be a waiter.
Could I use the phone?
She picked Rachel.
I mean, she tried to back out of it, but it was obvious. She picked Rachel.
He took my joke. He just took it.
This is wrong. You know what else is wrong?
Phoebe picking Rachel.
You know who else picked Rachel? Ross.
You know what else Ross did? He stole my joke.
I'm gonna get a joke journal, you know?
And document the date and time of every single one of my jokes.
Good idea. Know what's a bad idea?
Picking Rachel. That's right.
Did you hear something?
Maybe it's the sound of Ross climbing into my brain and stealing my thoughts.
It's coming from the living room.
I finished my book.
Hey. Hey.
Don't you guys look cute.
You guys make a cute couple.
Monica, what are you doing?
Nothing, Just trying to re-create some of the fun that we had at my place the other day.
Remember? When you picked Rachel over me?
That was funny. Ha, ha, ha.
It was kind of funny. It wasn't funny at all!
Why would you do that?
Why didn't you pick me?
Fine.
The reason I was leaning a little bit more toward Rachel than you...
...is just, you know, you're...
...high maintenance. Let's go to lunch.
That is completely untrue.
You think I'm high maintenance? Okay, Prove it.
I want you write out a list, and we're going to go through it point by point.
No, you're right, you're easygoing.
You're just not as easygoing as Rachel. you know, She's just more...
...flexible and mellow. That's all.
Well, people are different.
Ya, you know, Rachel...she'll do whatever you want. Y'know, you can just walk all over her.
What? Wait a minute. What are you saying, that I'm a pushover? I'm not a pushover.
Oh, okay. You're not a pushover.
You think I'm a pushover. Well, watch this.
you know what? You're not invited to lunch!
What do you think of that? I think that's pretty strong.
that's what I think. Come on, Monica, let's go to lunch.
You start working on that list.
I cannot believe her. I know. Where do you want to eat?
Oh-Oh, I love that Japanese place. I'm sick of Japanese. Not going there.
Wherever you want to go is cool. All right.
Oh, hey, Gunther...
...check this out.
Yeah, that-that Chandler cracks me up.
Hey Ross, listen, you want anything to drink,‘cause I’m heading up there.
Yeah. I'll take a coffee. Thanks. man.
Coffee? No.
Coffee? ‘Cause I’m going up there.
No. No, thank you.
You guys need anything, ‘cause I’m heading up there.
I'd love ice water.
You got it.
Joey, what are you doing?
Just being friendly.
Joey, honey, I don’t think you’re supposed to go back there.
No, it's okay. Right, Gunther?
Don't wink at me.
And put on your apron.
Okay. Heh, heh.
but I don’t see you asking other paying customers to put on aprons.
Joey, do you work here? No.
Waiter. Yeah!
Joey, what's going on'? Why didn't you tell us you work here?
Uh...
It's kind of embarrassing. I mean, I was an actor, now I'm a waiter.
It's supposed to go in the other direction.
So's your apron. You're wearing it like a cape.
I mean, the job's easy and the money's good, you know?
I guess I'm going to be hanging out here anyway. I might as well get paid for it, right?
I just feel kind of weird serving you guys, you know?
It'll be great.
Come on, I did it and it was fine.
Why would it be weird?
Hey, Joey? Can I get some coffee?
Okay. It doesn't seem that weird.
Seriously, I asked before. You still haven't gotten it.
See, now it's weird again.
I think it's great that you work here. You're gonna make a lot of money. Here's your first tip.
Don't eat yellow snow. Ha, ha, ha.
2:15, coffeehouse.
Well, you know This is great. Finally, I have someone I can pass my wisdom to.
Let me tell you about a couple of things I learned while working at the coffeehouse.
First of all, the customer is always right.
A smile goes a long way.
And if anyone is ever rude to you, sneeze muffin.
Thanks, Rash.
Hey, look, you guys are just terrific, you know?
How about clearing out so I can get some new customers, huh?
It's all about turnover.
Joey.
Seriously, can I get my coffee?
Oh, I'm sorry, Ross.I'll get it for you right now.
And since I made you wait, I'll toss in a free muffin.
Phoebe, we'd like to talk to you for a second.
0Kay.
So, maybe I am a little high maintenance.
And maybe Rachel is a little bit of a pushover.
But you know what we decided you are?
Yes, we are very sorry to tell you this, but you, Phoebe, are flaky.
That's true, I am flaky.
So, what, you're just okay with being flaky?
Yeah, totally.
Then I'm okay with being high maintenance.
Yeah. And I am okay with being a pushover.
That's great. Good for you guys.
I am not high maintenance! I am not a pushover!
Who said you were? You did!
I'm flaky. I'll say anything.
Hey, Gunther.
Can you uh, can you cover for me?  I just got an audition.
No, I'm leaving to get my hair dyed.
Really? I like your natural color.
Come on man, It's a great part. Check it out. I'm the lead guy's best friend.
I wait for him in this bar and save his seat. Listen.
"I'm sorry, that seat's saved."
That's the whole part? Okay, maybe he's not his best friend, but...
Okay, I'll see you in an hour.
Oh, man.
I could totally get that part. "I'm sorry, this seat is taken."
Oh, excuse me. No, no, I didn't mean you. 
But you believed me, huh?
I believed you were saving this seat for someone.
So you'd hire me, right?
For what?
Exactly! All right, everybody listen up!
The coffeehouse is going to be closed for about an hour.
What?
It's for the kids.
Yeah, to keep the kids off drugs.
Yeah. It's a very important issue in this month's Playboy.
I'm sure you all read about it.
It's my joke. It's my joke.
It's my joke.
Y'know, I don't think  we're gonna settle this.
No. Let's have Monica decide. Yeah.
Hey, Mon! Mon, get out here!
Monica? Okay.
You have to help us decide whose joke this is.
Why do I have to?
You're the only one that can be fair. Yeah.
I can't be. You're my boyfriend.
But I'm your brother. We're family.
That's the most important thing in the world.
Don't try to sway her.
I'm your only chance to have a baby.
Okay, let's go. All right.
We'll each tell you how we came up with the joke...
...and then you decide which one of us is telling the truth—me.
Chandler, you go first.
Okay, I thought of the joke two months ago at lunch with Steve.
Oh, wait, is he the guy I meet him at Christmas? Can I finish my story?
Do you want me to pick you?
See, I would never snap at you like that.
Two babies.
Continue. Okay.
Steve said he had to go to the doctor. And his doctor's name is Dr. Mompey.
I said, "Dr. Monkey?" And that is how the whole Dr. Monkey thing came up.
Are you kidding?
Okay, look, I study evolution.
Remember? Evolution.
Monkey into man.
Plus, I'm a doctor. And...
...I had a monkey.
I'm Dr. Monkey!
I'm not arguing with that. All right.
I've heard enough. I've made my decision.
Oh! Okay, so what--? Do tell.
You are both idiots.
The joke is not funny, and it's offensive to women.
And doctors. And monkeys.
You shouldn't argue over who gets credit.
You should be arguing over who gets blamed for inflicting this horrible joke upon the world.
Now, let it go.
The joke sucks.
It's your joke. It is not.
Oh, my God, Chandler, there you are. Hi.
Hey, it's Phoebe and Rachel.
Why don't you tell them...
...what you were telling me earlier about me not being high maintenance.
Monica is a self-sufficient, together lady.
Being with her has been like being on a vacation.
And what may be perceived as high maintenance...
...is merely attention to detail...
...and...
...generosity of spirit.
Wow. You know what? That is the best fake speech I think I've ever heard.
Really? I've heard better.
Wait, he came up with that himself. Tell them, Chandler.
I'm out of words. Should I just say the whole thing again?
Look, I am not high maintenance!
I am not. Chandler!
You're a little high maintenance.
You are on my list!
Look, I'm sorry, but you're not--
You're not easygoing, but you're passionate.
And that's good.
And when you get upset about little things, I think I'm pretty good...
...at making you feel better about that.
That's good too. They say you're high maintenance...
...but it's okay, because I like...
...maintaining you.
I didn't even tell him to say that.
Aw. Okay.
All right, you're off my list. I'm off the list.
Phoebe?
It's okay that you don't want me to be your girlfriend.
Because I have the best boyfriend.
You know, suddenly I find you very attractive.
Hey, buddy boy, How'd the audition go?
Oh, not good. No.
I didn't get the part. And I lost my job here, so...
Wow, that is a bad audition.
Well, how did you lose your job here?
Well, I had the audition...
...but Gunther said I had to stay here and be in charge so he could get his hair dyed.
So I went anyway, and he fired me.
He left work in the middle of the day to do a personal errand...
...and left you in charge when you've been here two days?
That's not right.
What are you gonna do?
Joey, you can't let him get away with that.
Ya know what, I won't let him get away with that. I'm gonna say something to him--
No, I really shouldn't say anything. No, I should say something to him!
Gunther? I want you to give Joey his job back.
That is really not fair that you have to fire him-Okay.
What? He can have his job back.
That's right, he can have his job back.
Glad we got that all straightened out.
There you go, Joey.
Got your job back. That's great. Thanks, Rach.
Pretty nice, huh? Now who's a pushover?
Rach, you're in my seat. I'm sorry.
Hey, I never got to hear who you'd pick to be your girlfriend.
I'd pick you, Phoebe. Yeah, definitely you, Pheebs.
Yeah, I kind of thought.
Never. It would totally be you.
Hey.
Hey. Oh, I have a question. If-if-if one of you had to pick one of the other two to go out with...
...who would you pick?
No way. I'm not answering.
Joey.
No way, I'm not answering that.
Okay, Rash, that's muffin and espresso, 4.50.
Ross, double latte, 2.75. Chandler, coffee and a scone, 4.25.
And, Pheebs, herbal tea, 1.25.
So all together that's 12.75.
This coming from the man who couldn't split our $80 phone bill in half.
Hi. Hi.
How much do I owe you for the muffin and the latte?
Oh, that's on the house, courtesy of Joey Tribbiani.
Oh. Great. Well, tell him thanks.
And since Joey seems like such a nice guy, maybe we could go on a date sometime?
Well, he's not used to women being so forward with him...
...but uh, I good check with him—He says it's okay.
Great. Thanks. Bye-bye.
Hey, Joey, how come our stuff isn't free?
It will be when you look like that in a tight skirt.
This is great. I'm getting more dates than ever.
Wait, you're only giving away free stuff to the pretty girls?
Yeah，Joey, that is so gross.
Hmm. How about a scone on the house, baby?
I'm pretty.
Friends  S06E13  The One With Rachel's Sister
Hey, does anyone have any gum? Oh, I do.
Here. Sorry.
Oh, you know what?
No.
Wait a second.
I know it's in here somewhere. You know what? I'm good. I'm good.
Hey. Hey.
What are you doing here? Shouldn't you be at work?
They sent me home. They said I can't work if I'm sick.
Aw.
I'm so sorry that you're sick. I'm not sick.
I don't get sick.
Getting sick is for weaklings. It's for pansies.
Honey, no one thinks that you're a pansy.
But we do think that you need a tissue.
I have not been sick in over three years.
I'm gonna grab you some tissue. I don't need a tissue. I'm fine.
When you put a D at the end of "fine," you're not fine.
I'm fine.
I'm fine.
You know, it's a really hard word to say.
Yes? Hi. ls Rachel here? I'm her sister.
Oh, my God, Jill. Oh, my God, Rachel.
Oh, my God, introduce us.
This is Chandler. Hi.
And you know Monica and Ross.
Hi. And that's Phoebe, and that's Joey.
Hey. How you doing? Don't.
Honey, what are you doing here? Oh.
Which sister is this?
Is this the spoiled one or the one that bit her?
Daddy cut me off. Never mind, I got it.
And you know what I said to him?
I said, "I'm gonna hire a lawyer, and I'm gonna sue  you and take all your money...
...and then I'm gonna cut you off."
What did he say? He said he wouldn't pay for my lawyer.
Then he told me to come  here and learn about the value of money...
...from the one daughter he's actually proud off.
Did you hear that? My dad's proud of me. My dad's proud of me. Ha, ha.
Rash'? Oh, yeah, sorry.
Hey, honey, so, what did you do that made Dad cut you off?
Okay, I bought a boat. You bought a boat?
Yeah, but it wasn't for me, it was for a friend.
Boy, did we make friends with the wrong sister.
Jill, honey, I think this is the best thing that could've ever happened to you.
You've needed to get out on your own anyway.
And you know, when I did it, at first I was scared...
...but then look at me now.
I am the only daughter that Dad is proud of.
Okay, well, this is what you're gonna do. You're gonna get a job.
You're gonna get an apartment. And I'll help you.
You can stay with us. Right? Phoebe，She can stay with us?
Of course, yeah. Oh, that's so great.
Okay, I'm really gonna do this. I don't know how to thank you guys.
Aw. I like cars.
You all finished here? Yes.
Great.
Okay, here are the tips for this morning. Mm.
Jen gets 50, 5O for me, and Joey owes $8.
What? For all the free food you gave away.
Well, if it's free food, how come you're charging me for it'?
We don't give anything away unless it's someone's birthday.
Oh. What if they came in third in a modeling contest?
No. Oh. Sorry.
I just had the hardest day. Some of these are so heavy.
Jill, how did you pay for all this? I thought your dad took your credit card.
Oh, please, I memorized those numbers when I was 15.
But look at all the cool make-it-on-my-own stuff I got.
This is my "Please hire me" sweater.
And these are my "Don't you want to rent me this apartment?" pants.
I don't think charging clothes to your dad qualifies as making it on your own.
Oh, Mr. Scientist has to get all technical.
I don't think Rachel's gonna think it's a good idea.
So who made her queen of the world? I would love that job.
Hey. What's going on? Hey.
Jill.
Did you shop?
No.
They did.
Yeah, we went shopping. Yeah, we went shopping. Yeah.
You went shopping?
Then you came in here and paraded it right under Jill's nose...
...when you know she's trying to quit.
Wow. You guys, that's terrible.
Sorry, Jill. Sorry, Jill.
It's okay.
So, what did you get? Oh, well, all right. I got-Thank you.
I got, um, this, you know, "I want a job" sweater.
Oh.
And then I got, uh... These are apartment pants.
Apartment pants?
Yeah, you've never heard of them?
No, of course. Of course I've heard of them.
Ross, what did you get? Huh?
I got this...
This.
A pashmina? Yeah.
Oh, I love these babies.
Really? Mm-hm.
Ross, what's a pashmina?
It's a rug.
Jill?
I'm sorry, Rachel.
Oh, come on, you really think that's gonna work on me?
I invented that.
Oh, right. But I am sorry.
All right, it's okay. One little setback is okay.
But don't let it happen again, all right? Okay.
Now, since Daddy paid for all this stuff, I should take it all away.
But I'm just gonna take the pashmina.
And the pants.
You know what? I'm just gonna take it all, because that way, you'll learn the lesson.
All right
I'm gonna run a couple of errands, and I will see you at dinner.
She took all my stuff.
Yeah. Everything but the little blue one.
That's the best one.
Oh, my God. Thank you so much. Oh. Well, hey.
Oh, my gosh, that was so lame. Like a pashmina could be a rug.
Oh, yeah? Well, how about you with the:
"I'm sorry." Shut up. I wasn't like that at all.
What about what I said, you know, about the apartment pants?
How dumb was I?
Were you this cute in high school? Oh, stop.
No, you stop. No, you stop.
You stop.
Okay-okay, why don't I sit here and then you'll both stop it?
Okay, so, what do you wanna do? Let's do something crazy.
I know, let's rest and drink lots of fluids.
Okay, I'll rest.
But, you know, if I'm going to bed, then you're coming with me.
See, that would be impossible to resist if you weren't all drippy here.
Are you saying that you don't wanna get with this?
Yeah, I don't think you should say that even when you're healthy.
Oh. Come on.
Don't take this personally, okay?
It's just that I just can't have sex with a sick person.
I'm with you, Chandler.
I can't have sex with a sick person either. That's disgusting.
But I'm not sick. Let me prove it to you.
We are two healthy people in the pribe of libe.
See, that's the thing. I would like to stay in...
...the prime of mwha-ah-libe.
Hey.
Hey. What's up?
Um, I think there's something you should maybe know.
Well, it’d better not be about the apartment pants...
...because I just pitched the idea to my boss at Ralph Lauren, and she loved it.
No, no. It's just, I was, um...
I was with Ross and Jill after you left...
...and I'm pretty sure I saw a little spark between them.
What? Yeah, I mean, it's probably nothing.
But I just wanted to warn you that there might be something there.
With Ross and Jill? Yeah.
With Ross and my sister?
Yeah.
With my sister Jill and my ex-boyfriend Ross?
Yeah.
Oh, there is no way. Okay, then.
Oh, my God. I cannot believe that.
I don't really like it when Ross goes out with anyone, but my sister?
Isn't that like incest or something?
Oh, my God, and they're gonna have sex. Oh, no. What if he marries her too?
Oh, this is just terrible. This is just terrible.
And I can't stop it. I don't own Ross, you know?
And Jill, she should be able to do whatever it is she wants to do.
Oh, my God, I can't believe Ross is marrying my little sister.
This is just--
Oh, my God, this is just the worst thing that could've ever happened to me.
But great news about the apartment pants, huh?
That'll be 3.85.
What do you mean? Yesterday you said I was too pretty to pay for stuff!
It's just I can't, because my manager said that I--
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday, dear Annie-Amy.
Am.
Happy birthday to you
Hey. Hey, that's weird, today's my birthday too.
Yeah, not in here it isn't.
Sorry I'm late. What's up?
On, hey. Uh...
You know, I just wanted to see if there were any leads on the old job front.
Oh. No. But I just walked past three sales and I didn't go in.
How strong am I? Oh.
That is great.
Hey, you know who doesn't have to job-hunt?
Ross. He works at the university. Yeah?
Oh so you know that, you guys talked about that, so you get along, so you think you’re gonna go out?
Me go out with Ross? No. God, no. What would make you think that?
I just, Phoebe...
...said she, you know, thought she saw something between you guys.
No. I mean, he's nice. Yeah.
He's the kind of guy you're friends with but not the kind of guy you date.
I mean, he's the kind of guy you date, because you did, but me?
Hmm, not so much.
Oh, not so much? What do you mean?
I mean, is there something wrong with Ross?
Oh, no, no, no. He's just--
I don't know. You know, he's just a little bookish.
Are you saying he's a geek? You think so too?
No. No. Ross is not a geek.
Fine. Then let's just say he's not my type.
What, handsome is not your type?
Smart, kind, good kisser? What, those things aren't on your list?
Ross is a great guy. You would be lucky to be with him.
Well, okay, if it means that much to you, I'll ask him out.
Oh, no, no, no. That's not what I meant. I was just--
You know what, Rachel? You're right. You know, he has been really nice to me.
Yeah, but he's not your type.
But maybe that's a good thing.
You know, I'm doing all these different things.
Maybe I should just try dating a geek too.
Yeah, but you don't, you know-You don't wanna try too much too fast.
I mean, you do remember what happened to the little girl...
...who tried too much too fast, don't you?
What?
She died, Jill.
Chandler.
What is it, honey? You need some tea? Some soup?
Oh. Oh.
Calling Dr. Big. Dr. Big to the bed.
Oh, jeez, honey, I thought, I thought you were asleep.
How could I be asleep knowing that you were in the next room?
I was asleep.
Oh, no, no, no, honey. You know what's sexy? Layers.
Layers are sexy.
And blankets are sexy. And, oh, hot water bottles are sexy.
Come on, get into bed. I wanna prove that I'm not sick.
I wanna make you feel as good as I feel.
Would you please get some rest? I'm fine.
Happy birthday to you
You're paying for that. What? No, no, it's her birthday.
You've sung "Happy Birthday" to 20 different women today.
But it-You are no longer authorized...
...to distribute birthday muffins.
Damn it.
Rash .
Hi. Hi. Ahem.
Did you tell your sister to ask me out?
Well, yeah. Oh, wow. I mean, wow.
I think she's cute...
...but I never would've thought of going out with her. Never.
Really? Yeah.
But after you said it was okay, I figured, why not?
Oh, so not really "never." Heh.
I have to say, you are a much bigger person than I am.
I mean, after all we've been through. I just--
You know what? I wish I had a brother to reciprocate.
Aw.
Hey, if you ever wanna go out with Monica, you have my blessing.
And mine.
Chandler?
I think I'm sick.
Really?
Struck down in the...
prime of libe.
Okay, fine, I admit it. I feel terrible.
Will you please rub this on my chest? Okay.
No, no, no. You are not getting me this way.
Come on, I really need your help here. No, no, no.
Fine, I'll rub it on myself. Okay.
So you're just kind of rubbing it on yourself?
Yeah. It's nice.
Are you kidding me? Is this turning you on?
Yes.
I can't believe it. Is it the rubbing or the smell?
It's all very, very good.
So you wanna go, uh...
...mix it up?
Not now, I'm sick. Oh, come on, you big faker.
What about your rule about never sleeping with sick people?
Well, that was before all the vaporizing action.
Okay, if you really wanna have sex. Okay.
Worked like a charm.
Hi. Hi.
What are you doing here?
This is where Ross and I are meeting for our date. So, what do you think?
I don't like it.
Really? It's kind of slutty.
It's yours.
Yeah, well, I'm a slut.
Me too.
Hi, Jill. Hey.
Hi...
Rachel. Rachel.
Heh. You're not at home, you're right here.
Yeah, I know.
And I bet you thought it would be weird. But it's not.
0Kay.
So, Well, I'll, um...
I'll have her home by midnight. Ha, ha.
Why aren't you home yet?
ls someone there?
Oh, yeah, it's me. Sorry.
What are you doing here?
Uh, I'm just looking out your window at the view.
What are you guys doing?
We got some VapoRub in some places.
Oh. He brought her back to his apartment.
Who?
Is that your sister?
Ugh. She is a slut.
God. Ross is on a date with your sister. How weird is that?
Oh, my God, look, he's taking off her clothes.
He's taking off her coat.
Oh, this is just terrible.
Oh, no, it's not. It was the first date. I'm sure that nothing is gonna...
Hoo-hoo. He's gonna get some.
Of the glare...
...from the Streetlight out of his apartment.
You know, so, urn, he's closed the drapes there...
...so he can have a nice pleasant conversation with your little sister.
Well, I'm off to bed.
Oh. Uh, hey, Rach. I was just coming over here to, uh...
Oh, wait, I don't have to lie to you, you don't live here anymore.
I'm eating their food. What are you doing?
Ross is on a date with my sister.
They shut the drapes two and a half hours ago.
Whoa, I didn't know we could date your sister.
Joey, we know you steal our food.
I'm good.
Oh, are the drapes still closed hon?
Yeah. And y'know who should've shut their drapes is that perverted couple two doors over.
Is that a swing? Oh, don't even ask.
I can't believe Ross is going out with Rachel's sister.
When Chandler made out with my sister, I was mad at him for 1O years.
That was like five years ago. Yeah, you got five years left.
Joey-You wanna make it six?
Friends  S06E14  The One Where Chandler Can't Cry
Oh, Ross, hey. Hi, how are you? There you are.
Hey.
Can I get a cup of coffee?
So how was your big date last night?
Uh, it was okay. Yeah, it was fun.
It was fun? Yeah.
Great.
So, uh... So did you guys hit it off?
I guess so. So, uh... So did anything happen?
Because rumor has it you guys shut the drapes. Heh.
No, no, nothing happened.
I shut the drapes to show her slides of my favorite fossils.
Oh, slides. Ha, ha.
So really nothing happened.
Something could've happened, all right? She really dug my slides.
Mm. And she was definitely giving me the vibe.
Was it the "Please don't show me another picture of a trilobite" vibe?
Anyway...
If she wasn't into me, why would she ask me out again?
She asked you out again? Yeah, uh-huh.
Tomorrow night. Hmm.
Valentine's Day. The most romantic day of the year.
Who knows what could happen?
I might not be shutting my drapes to show her my slides, if you know what--
Okay, okay, okay, I got it, I got it.
I can't-I can't go with the you-and-my-sister thing.
I just can't. It's just too weird, all right?
I imagine the two of you together, I freak out.
It just freaks me out, and I can't do it. Okay, okay, okay. No-Yes. It's okay.
It's okay.
Hey, it's too weird for you. I won't see her again.
Thank you. I-Yeah. I mean, after tomorrow night.
No, no, no. Please, Ross. I can't do it. It's gonna freak me out.
Okay, okay, okay.
Okay. I'll tell her tonight I can't see her anymore.
Ross, thanks.
You want me to call her right now? Oh, no. No, no, no.
I mean, come on, that's craz-I mean, that's crazy.
So, what's going on with you? What is going on with you?
Well, um... Oh.
I may teach another class this semester. Yeah, do it now. Call her right now.
This is my favorite part. Yeah, me too.
Oh, you know what's sadder than this? Bambi.
I cried for three days with that movie. No, wait, two.
Because on the third day, my mother killed herself, so I was partly crying for that.
Well, see, now, that I can see crying over, but Bambi is a cartoon.
You didn't cry when Bambi's mother died?
Yes, it was very sad when the guy stopped drawing the deer.
Chandler, There's nothing wrong with crying. You don't have to be so macho all the time.
I'm not macho.
Yeah, you're right.
I don't know what I was thinking.
I guess I just never really cried, you know? I'm not a crying kind of guy.
Come on, man, there's gotta be something that gets you choked up.
Like, uh...
What if you saw a three-legged puppy?
I'd be sad, sure, but I wouldn't cry.
Okay, what if the puppy said, "Help me, Chandler.
All the other puppies pick on me."
Cry? I just found a talking puppy. I'm rich.
Oh. I've got it. I have got it. Pictures from your childhood.
This will get you going good.
All right, what's going on there? Oh, that's Parents' Day, first grade.
That's me with the janitor, Martin.
Where are your parents? Oh, they didn't wanna come.
Oh, Chandler. You poor thing.
So that story doesn't make you cry?
No. Look, I don't cry. It's not a big deal, okay?
No. It's not okay. It's not okay at all.
You're dead inside.
Excuse me. Yeah?
Are you Phoebe Buffay? Yeah.
Can I get your autograph? I'm your biggest fan.
Oh, you're my biggest fan? I've always wanted to meet you. Hi. Ha, ha.
Sure, yeah. Wow.
Wow, thanks a lot.
I just wanna say I think you're really talented.
You're just saying that because you're my biggest fan.
Joey, listen, take good care of that guy. okay? He's a fan.
Bye.
So you saw me on Days of Our Lives, huh?
Want me to, want me to do a little Dr. Drake Ramoray for you?
I have no idea what you're talking about.
But I just got Phoebe Buffay's autograph.
Oh. You're Phoebe's fan. Oh, yeah. I've seen all her movies.
Movies? That was Phoebe Buffay, the porn star.
I don't think so. No, no, it was.
She was in Sex Toy Story 2...
...Lawrence of a Labia.
And I got her autograph.
The guys at the comic-book store aren't gonna believe this.
Gunther.
Hey, don't let that guy in here anymore. He just said Phoebe's a porn star.
Well, I wouldn't call her a star, but she's really good.
You should check out Inspect Her Gadget.
Hey. Hey.
You'll never believe what just happened.
Ross totally blew me off and didn't even tell me why.
Oh, well. You know what, honey?
The best thing to do to get over a guy is to start dating someone else.
Oh. Oh, there is this great guy you will just love at work named Bob.
He's a real up-and-comer in Human Resources.
Y'know, thanks for trying to cheer me up, but I’m not gonna date some random guy from your work.
Not random. Bob.
It's probably because I'm not mature enough or smart enough.
Maybe he doesn't like the way I dress.
No, that can't be it. It's really gotta be the smart thing. Ugh.
I'm so stupid.
I'm just this, like, incredibly pretty, stupid girl.
No, honey.
0Kay.
Okay. You wanna know why Ross canceled the date?
Because I asked him to.
You asked him to? Mm-hm.
Why? Because you are my sister...
...and Ross and I have this huge history.
I don't understand, do you want to go out with Ross? No.
You don't want him, but you don't want me to have him?
You know, Bob in Human Resources... Ugh.
I cannot believe you did this to me. You had me doubting how smart I was.
You had me doubting my fashion sense.
This is not that big a deal. You just don't date Ross.
There's a million other guys out there. Hey! You have no right to tell me what to do.
I'm not telling you what to do. I am telling you what not to do.
Why are you always so jealous of me? This is not about me being jealous of you.
This is about you being a brat, wanting what you can't have.
Can't have?
Excuse me, the only thing I can't have is dairy.
All right, all right. You just blew your chances at dating Bob.
Who? In Human Resources!
I am jealous of her?
I mean, who does she think she is, Princess Caroline?
You're jealous of Princess Caroline? Do I have my own castle?
Hey. Phoebe's not here, is she?
No. Oh, great, did you get a movie?
Uh...
Yeah. Yeah.
But, uh, I don't think it's the kind you're gonna like.
You didn't get more movies that are gonna have us reaching for the tissues all night, did you?
Sort of.
Guys, what's going on?
Phoebe's a porn star.
What? Yeah.
What are you talking about? Where?
"Phoebe Buffay in Buffay the Vampire Layer."
Oh, my God. Ha, ha. That's Phoebe. Where did you get that?
Down at the adult video place on Bleecker.
And I saw Joey was about to go in, so I ran in ahead of him...
...to surprise him.
And then-Ha, ha. Then I pretended that I didn't know he was in there.
Wow. I mean, I just can't-I can't believe this.
You know? I mean, you think you know someone.
even, Even Phoebe, who's always been somewhat of a question mark.
This is so bizarre.
I guess it kind of makes sense, though. She had such a terrible childhood.
Hey, I had a terrible childhood and I don't do porn.
Yes, but you're dead inside. Ah.
All right, well, I'd better take that back. What? Why? Why?
We can't watch that. I mean, that's Phoebe.
Yeah you’re right, We shouldn't watch this. Absolutely not. That goes back.
But, you know, maybe a little bit. How about just the first half?
Hey, no, this is wrong, you guys. Phoebe's our friend.
I'm not gonna watch it. Yeah.
Good for you, Joe. Yeah.
Ah. I thought I'd find you here, Nosferatool.
Buffay, are you going to plunge your stake into my dark places?
Actually, I was kind of hoping it would be the other way around.
Hold on, what is that on her ankle? Her ankle is what you're watching?
Well, it's hard to tell. Ooh.
Oh, God, if she would just stop moving.
She's just doing her job.
You sick bastards.
Oh. It's a tattoo. That's weird. Phoebe doesn't--
Wait, that's Ursula. That's not Phoebe. That is Ursula.
Wait, wait. I can watch that. Rewind it. Rewind it.
Hey. Oh.
What's up? Oh, my God. What am I doing?!
Hey, sweetie. Hey.
Chicken Soup for the Soul?
There's no back to this couch.
Why are you reading this? You hate this kind of stuff.
Yeah I know, but I figured a shot y'know? 
Maybe one of those stories would make me cry.
Then you wouldn't think I was all dead inside.
Aw, that's so sweet.
Chandler, I don't care if you can't cry. I love you.
Oh, that makes me feel so warm in my hollow tin chest.
Stop it. I mean, come on, seriously. Think about it.
We get married, I'm up at the altar, and I'm like this:
I won't care.
Because I know that you'll be feeling it all in here.
Yeah? Yeah.
And if we have a baby one day...
...and the doctor hands it to you in the delivery room...
...and you don't cry, so what?
And if we take him to college and we come home...
...and we see his empty room for the first time...
...and you got nothing?
Won't matter to me.
0Kay.
Well, I won't worry about this anymore, then.
Yeah. And, you know, if I die...
...from a long illness...
...and you're writing out my eulogy...
...and you open the desk drawer and find a note from me that says:
"I will always be with you"...
...and you still can't shed one tiny tear...
...I know you'll be crying a river inside.
Aw, I love you, sweet-What is wrong with you?
What? What?
You can't shed a tear for your dead wife?
I mean, I left you a note from the beyond.
So you didn't mean any of that? No, you robot!
You damn kids. You ring my bell one more time, I swear to--
Oh, uh, Jill. Um...
That's just a little game I play with the kids down the hall.
They've really taken a liking to me.
What's the matter?
Rachel and I had a really big fight. Can I come in?
I know we're not supposed to see each other anymore. I'm okay with that.
I don't know anybody in the city, and I need somebody to talk to about it.
Oh, of course. What happened? I don't wanna talk about it.
Okay. Um...
But you know what might really cheer me up? What?
Seeing some more of your super-cool slides.
Wow, really? Totally. I loved them.
And maybe you could finish telling me about all the different kinds of sand.
I'd love to. You wait right here. I'll go get the projector and my notes.
Oh, great. Thanks, Ross. You're such a good friend.
Oh.
Hey. Have you guys seen Jill? I can't find her anywhere.
No, I haven't. ls Ross home?
Maybe I'll just call him and see if he's actually seen her.
Who is it?
It's Phoebe, "Phoebe."
Hey. Oh, God.
So you're making porn movies. No, I'm not.
We're still rolling.
You're making one right now.
Let's go, Phoebe. And you're using my name.
Yeah, can I help you with something?
Phoebe, come on.
Look, I'm talking right now. You're-You mean her. Oh.
You know, twin stuff is always a real big seller.
What?
Yeah. I could talk them into giving you like $30.
No. No way. No.
And stop using my name. And shame on you.
And shame on all of you. You're disgusting.
Especially you, with that.
Slides are almost ready.
Yeah. Ooh, I know what this is missing.
Alcohol.
Okay, well, there's wine in the kitchen. Oh, great.
Hello?
What is my sister doing there, and why are the drapes shut?
Okay. Rash, calm down, okay?
She's really upset. We're just talking.
I think she's trying to make something happen with you to get back at me.
Oh, so that's the only reason she could be here, huh?
It couldn't have anything to do with the fact that I'm a good listener...
...and I put on a great slide show?
Ross, I am telling you, she is using you to get back at me.
You know, I think I can take care of myself. I'll talk to you later. Goodbye.
Uh, that was your sister, actually.
She thinks you're just using me. Heh.
So?
Hey. Hey.
So I just came from the company Ursula works for.
Oh, no, not you too.
No, no. I went to pick up Phoebe Buffay's checks.
There were a lot of them.
Nice. Mm-hm.
And I won't have to go back there anymore...
...because I gave them my "correct address."
That's great, but isn't it gonna bother you that people think you're a porn star?
Oh, no, no. I know how to handle it.
Good. Yeah.
You're trying to figure out where you know me from?
All right, I'll give you a hint. From porn. Okay?
Yeah, your pervert boyfriend watched me in a porno movie!
See? Yeah.
Hey.
You, uh, may have been right about Jill. Oh, I knew it. What happened?
Um, she kissed me. What? You kissed?
Maybe we should give them some privacy. Shh!
Look, I tried not to kiss her, okay?
It doesn't sound like it. It's pretty easy not to kiss someone.
You just don't kiss them. See? Look at us right now, not kissing.
Let me finish, okay?
She started kissing me, and I didn't stop it.
I guess I just wasn't thinking.
Yeah,  that's right you weren't thinking! Y'know what? Let me give you something to think about.
Hold on.
But then I started thinking and I stopped the kissing.
Oh, well, thank you for taking your tongue out of my sister's mouth long enough to tell me that.
Look, I realized if anything were to happen with me and Jill...
...then nothing could ever happen with us.
What? No, I mean...
Look, I don't know if anything is ever going to happen with us again, ever.
But I don't wanna know that it never could.
So I stopped it...
...and she got mad and broke my projector.
Wow.
I don't even know what to say.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Oh, my God, are you crying?
I just don't see why those two can't work things out.
All right, I'm leaving. I'm not gonna spend one more day...
...with someone who's out to sabotage my every move.
That's you, Rachel.
Yeah, I got that.
And you. I throw myself at you, and you say no?
How gay are you?
You take care, Jill.
Okay, see you. Bye-bye.
I can't believe Jill's gone.
I can't help it. I opened a gate.
Hey, you guys, guess what?
Barry and Mindy are getting a divorce.
What is the matter with you?
No. Barry and Mindy.
Oh, sorry. I hear "divorce," I immediately go to Ross. Heh.
Who's Barry and Mindy?
Barry was the guy I almost married, and Mindy was my best friend.
Wasn't he cheating on you with her?
Yeah, but that just means he was falling asleep on top of her instead of me.
Could you imagine if I actually married him?! I mean how different would my life be?
I know what you mean, I've always wondered how different my life would be...
...if I'd never gotten divorced.
Which time? The first time!
No seriously, imagine if Carol hadn't realized she was a lesbian.
I can't. I keep seeing it the good way.
I'd bet I'd still be doing my kara-tay.
Towards the end of our marriage, I was doing a lot of kara-tay as a way of releasing the tension...
...from, you know, not doing anything else physical.
Maybe the problem was pronouncing it "ka-ra-tay."
And what if I was still fat?
Well, You wouldn't be dating me, that's for sure.
Sure I would.
What? You guys really think that I'm that shallow?
No, I think Monica was that fat.
Hey, imagine if I'd never gotten fired off Days of Our Lives.
Hey. Hey, there's Carol again.
What if I had had the guts to quit my job?
I'd probably be writing for The New Yorker, being paid to be funny.
But my job's fun too. I mean, tomorrow...
...I don't have to wear a tie.
What if I'd taken that job at Merrill Lynch?
What? Merrill Lynch?
Yeah, I had a massage client who worked there and-and he said I had a knack for stocks.
Well why didn't you take the job?
Because at that time, you see, I thought that everything that rhymed was true.
So I thought y'know that if I'd work with stocks,...
...I'd have to live in a box and only eat lox and have a pet fox.
Hey, do you guys think that if all those things happened, we'd still hang out?
Friends  S06E15  The One That Could Have Been
Oh, my God. Rachel Green?
Aah! Rob Tilman!
No, heh, no, it's me. Ross.
Oh, I'm sorry. Ross Tilman.
No. No, no. Ross Geller. Of course! Monica's brother.
Yeah. Right. Wow! How are you?
Good. Good, I'm married. Oh! Me too! Ha, ha.
Isn't it the best? Oh, it's the best. Heh.
So, um, how's Monica? Really, really great.
Actually, she's right down the street. Um, you should stop by and say hi.
Oh, I would love to. Yeah, she'd be so excited.
Oh, okay. Come on.
Wait, don't you have to pay for your...
...Busty Ladies?
No, that's okay. Some kid asked me to pick it up for him, but I...
So, Monica, still going outwith Dr. Boring, huh?
He's not boring. He's just...
He's just low-key.
Here you go, one hazelnut latte. Thank you.
You know, the hazelnut, actually not a nut.
It's a seed.
Wow.
Can anyone else name a well-known seed that's been masquerading as a nut?
Oh, dear God. Let me think.
Hey.
Oh, no. What's the matter?
I got another rejection letter.
They said my writing was funny, just not "Archie Comic funny."
Y'know what honey? I gotta get back to the hospital.
All right. Okay.
Bye. 'Bye-bye.
Oh, uh, by the way, the answer is the Brazil nut.
Was his question what's more boring than him?
Hey, man. Sorry about that Archie thing.
You, uh, need me to give you some money?
Hey, I may have no money, but I still have my pride.
Really?
Eh.
Maybe Joey doesn't have to give you money.
TV stars have assistants, right? That's an idea.
If I hire an assistant, would you take money from her?
No, Joey. Chandler could be your assistant.
See, he could answer your fan mail and stuff.
That's great! That would be great! Let's do that!
I could use the money. Give me time to write.
Oh right great! Welcome aboard. Okay!
All right. Now hey, I need to use the bathroom.
Since I don't need any assistance in there, take a break!
All right.
Hey. Hey, Phoebe.
Guess what? What?
Joey just hired Chandler to be his assistant.
Oh, that's so sweet.
Oh! Hang on!
Hang on!
Go!
No.No,no. I said sell when it hits 50!
5-0, It's a number! It comes after four-nine!
No, it's okay. It's okay. You're allowed one mistake.
Just kidding. You are of course fired.
Hey, Mon? Hey.
Mon, look who I ran into.
Oh, my God, Rachel!
God, you look terrific! Oh, so do you!
Thanks.
Did you lose weight? You are so sweet to notice.
Yes, I lost 3 and a half pounds.
And, and uh, you-you remember my friend Chandler? Hi.
And that's Phoebe over there!  Hi.
Oh my God, sit down. Sit down. How long's it been since we've seen each other?
1987, the day after Christmas. Uh, at Sean McMahon’s party.
I played you one of my songs. "Interplanetary Courtship Ritual."
Oh, yeah. Right.
So, now, do you, do you still do music? Well, sometimes.
you should come over. Sometime I'll play you one of my other... Oh, my God!
Joey Tribbiani from Days of Our Lives just walked in here!
Rach, he's a friend of ours. You are friends with Dr. Drake Ramoray?
Well it's kinda hard to be friends with Drake...
...because of his busy schedule and the fact that he's not real.
Hey, or I could bring my keyboard here sometime.
He's coming over. Joey?
I know. Here, here.
Oh.
No. This is my friend Rachel. We went to high school together.
Ha, ha, hi. Hi.
I--
I love you on that show.
Oh. I watch you every day.
I mean, when you took out your kidney to save your ex-wife...
"eventhough she tried to kill you...
It's always nice to meet fans.
She's not crazy, is she? No.
So, uh, how you doing?
Hang on.
Hang on. Hang on.
Go!
Who's this?
Oh, you're gonna like working for me.
What's your name? What kind of name is Brindy?
L-Uh, whatever.
Stop talking.
All right, from now on your name is Joan.
You can pick your own last name.
Hey, there you are. Uh-oh, it's my boss.
All right, here's a list of things for you to do today.
This is gonna be so great. Thank you so much.
All right, I gotta go to work. I'm delivering twins, but only one of them is mine.
"Drop off my dry cleaning. Pick up my vitamins."
Teach me how to spell vitamins.
"Wear in my new jeans."
You realize what you are, don't you? What?
You're his bitch.
No, no! No!
Wait! You didn't sit on my Kit Kats did you?
No, there was a little, little dip in the market...
...and I lost $13 million.
But the Kit Kats are all right?
What am I gonna do?! What am I gonna do? I can't call my office, they'll kill me.
I can't call my clients, they'll kill themselves!
All right, now my chest hurts. What?
My chest hurts. Ugh.
Ugh! And now, I can't breathe. Phoebe, are you having a heart attack?!
If I were, would I have shooting pains up and down my left arm?
Yes. Then, yes. That is what I'm having.
Oh, my God!
Come on, Pheebs, it's not that bad.
Y'know most people'd be excited if they didn't work for a couple weeks.
Most people don't like their jobs. I love my job.
I've been not working for three hours, and I'm already going crazy.
I miss Joan.
Honey, having a heart attack is nature's way of telling you to slow it down.
I always thought having a heart attack was nature's way of telling you to die. Heh.
but you're not gonna die.
I mean, you are going to die, but you're not gonna die today.
I wish I was dead.
Let's take a walk.
Y'know maybe you should consider writing for Talking Out of Your Ass magazine.
So what's going on with you?
Well, um, I've been doing a lot more of my karate.
Still going through that dry spell with Carol? Yeah.
How long has it been since you've had sex?
Well, last weekend... That's not so bad.
...will be two months...
...since I stopped trying.
Maybe you need to spice things up a little.
What do you mean? I don't know.
You could tie her up. You could eat stuff off each other.
Oh.
Dirty talk,  menage a trois, toys... Wow.
Role-playing. You could be the warden; she could be the prisoner.
You could be the pirate; she could be the wench. Okay, I think I got it.
Yeah! Or too, you could be two Stockbrokers, and you're-you're-you're rolling naked on the trading floor...
...and everybody's watching.
It never happened.
All right, And over there is Brady's Pub...
...where I unwind after a long day of "surgeoning."
Wow! This is so amazing. What else?
Well, that is a large piece of television equipment.
And, uh, that is an old man.
Hey, old man! Hey.
All righty. What do you say we head back to my place?
Well, wow. Um, you know, I would really love to, but I shouldn't.
Why? Why can't the world stop turning?
Just for a moment. Just for us.
Isn't that a line from the show?
Uh, yeah, but, uh...
...I may have said those things before, but...
...I never truly meant them until now.
That's a line from the show too!
Okay, you watch too much TV.
Joe, here's the freshly-squeezed orange juice you asked for.
Thanks. Hi.
Yeah, there's pulp in that.
Yeah? Heh.
I thought we talked about this. I don't like pulp.
No pulp. Pulp isn'tjuice. All juice. Okay?
I'm sorry. I guess I just like the pulp.
God, I'm sorry. I am being so rude.
Rachel, would you like a soda or something?
Because Chandler will run right out and get it.
Yeah, well, sure, iced tea would be great.
Iced tea.
Okay. Anything for you, sir?
Did I not just tell him?
Okay, look, Chandler, if this is gonna work...
...you have got to listen.
You're gonna throw that juice at me, aren't you?
It's not all juice.
Honey, this morning was fun, huh?
Me hopping in on you in the shower there?
Yeah, maybe someday we could get a place with two bathrooms.
Look, Carol, um, I was thinking maybe...
...maybe we can spice things up a little.
What do you mean? Carol, our sex life. It's just not--
Dad! Hey there, little fella!
Hey, why don't we get some shoes on you?
Hey, why don't you show dad how you put your shoes on in your room.
Seriously, our sex life.
I was thinking maybe, I don't know...
...we could try some new things, you know, for fun.
Like what? Well, I don't know. Um...
What if we, uh, were to...
...tie each other up?
Um, some people eat stuff off one another.
Yeah.
Um, you know, we could try dirty talk. Uh, heh.
Um, we could have a threesome. I love that idea!
Who sold a story to Archie Comics?
Oh, my God, that's so great. Oh, wow!
You're a published writer. I wish I had a present for you.
Aw. Wait a minute.
My last Kit Kat bar.
You want to share it? Okay!
Hey. Hey.
Hey Chandler look, I know you're mad. but I just want to say I'm sorry.
I was a total jerk. Completely over the line.
I just-I hate pulp.
You know how Monica feels about low-fat mayonnaise?
It's not mayonnaise!
Okay, uh, anyway, I just wanted to say I'm sorry, and here.
What's this? Fresh-squeezed orange juice, with pulp.
Just the way you like. Aw, thanks, man.
Hey, Joey? Chandler sold a story to Archie Comics.
Oh, my God, that's great! Congratulations! What's the story?
Oh, you wouldn't care. It's just a stupid comic book story.
Are you kidding me? I love Archie and the whole gang.
Well, um, Archie needs money to fix his jalopy.
Uh, but he doesn't want Reggie to just give him the money.
So Reggie hires him as his assist--
As his butler.
And makes him do crazy things...
...like bring him milk shakes that can't have lumps.
Wait a minute. That sounds a little familiar.
Did they already do that? I think I read it!
Monica, listen. I have to ask.
Okay, Joey Tribbiani invited me back to his apartment.
Does he do this with a lot of girls? Yeah, a lot. A lot, a lot.
Ah! And I'm one of them.
Wow.
I just cannot believe this. I mean, Joey Tribbiani.
Well, y'know it's none of my business, but aren't you married?
Yeah.
I wish we could just not be married for a little bit.
You know, I just wish we could be, like, on a break.
Well, you're not.
It's easy for you. You get to have sex with whoever you want.
Yeah, I can. Ha.
Don't think I don't. I do.
I mean, all the time. You bet!
Monica? Hmm?
You've done it, right?
Of course I have. What do you think, I'm like some 30-year-old virgin?
Oh, my God. You're a 30-year-old virgin.
Say it louder, I don't think the guy in the back heard.
Yeah, I heard it.
It's not like I haven't any opportunity. I mean, y'know, 
I'm waiting for the perfect guy. Mm-hm.
I'm seeing this guy Roger. all right? He's not perfect...
...but, uh, I'm thinking maybe I should get it over with.
give him my flower.
Oh, my God, do it! Honey, you've waited long enough.
You know what? You are right. Yes!! I mean sex does not have to be a big deal.
There shouldn't be all these rules and restrictions.Y'know,
People should be able to sleep with whoever they want, whenever...
Rachel. I'm never gonna think it's okay for you to cheat on your husband.
Oh, what do you know, virgin?
Phoebe?
Why is smoke coming out of the bathroom?
Oh, yeah. The doctor said that could be one of the side effects.
 Phoebe! Put that cigarette out.
No, it's not a cigarette. The smoke is coming out of me!
Put it out. Okay, okay!
I'm so glad you're here. Come on.
I got it. I got it. Give it to me! Give it!
Hello?
No, she can't come to the phone now.
Oh, right. No problem. Okay, bye-bye.
Was it work? Were they mad? Was it Jack? Did he yell?
No, just relax. Nobody yelled.
Jack was making sure you were getting better.
Thank God.
Yeah, she's fired.
You've done all you can, Dr. Wesley.
You've got to let her go.
Goodbye and Godspeed, Hope Brady.
Not so fast, Wesley.
Ramoray. That's right, Wesley.
I just stopped by to say that you're not a real doctor.
And that woman's brain is fine.
Oh, thank God. Oh, thank God.
Hope? Hope? Drake.
You're not dying, Hope.
You're gonna live a long, healthy life. With me.
Oh, Drake.
0Kay.
Here we go.
Okay. Ahem.
Hi, Joey? It's Rachel.
Um, I am free tomorrow night.
Yeah, sure, sure I can bring some sandwiches.
Friends  S06E16  The One That Could Have Been
So, honey, this, uh...
This threesome thing? Uh, heh.
I mean how-how are you gonna start to find...
Actually, I'm making a list of women I know who might be into this.
Oh. Wow.
Boy.
Well, someone's been doing their homework.
Yeah. Oh, and I know Gail Rosten is in there twice...
...but she is so...
Oh, I know. Ha, ha.
You know, just-just talking about it is getting me kind of...
I know. Me too. Yeah?
Well, I think Ben's asleep.
Oh, um...
You know, I think it'll be better if we just save it.
Yeah. Heh.
Right. Save it. I can do that.
Hey, Pheebs. Hey.
How's it going?
I've got to get out of this bed. I'm going crazy here! Crazy!
Here you go, sweetie.
What the hell is this, herbal tea? I hate herbal tea.
But, I put some honey in it.
She doesn't know she was fired yet, does she? No, the doctors say it may kill her.
What are you two girls whispering about over there?
But I think we should tell her.
Ugh, I mean, it's just so realistic.
I know. Yeah.
His name's Pat. Pat the dog.
Oh! Oh! I get it! Ha, ha!
Oh, God.
You, uh...? You...
...ready for a refill? Oh, I probably shouldn't.
Oh. So I Will! Ha.
It's like it's raining. Pretty cool, huh?
But if you thinking you can put a fish in there and it wouldn't get sucked into the mechanism...
...well, you'd be wrong.
Um, can I use your bathroom?
It's, uh, right through there. Okay. Ah.
God  y'know, I gotta tell you.
If someone told me a week ago...
...that I would be peeing in Joey Tribbiani's apartment
Life's pretty great, isn't it?
I hope you're hungry.
We're starting with oysters.
And y'know  what they say about oysters, don't you?
They have parasites?
No. Ha, ha.
Um, well, some people say that oysters are an aphrodisiac.
What people? People.
People say it.
Come here.
So, oysters, huh? Ha-ha-ha.
And then we're gonna have a little Middle Eastern couscous.
Something we can eat...
...with our hands.
Y'know, it's funny, but when we were studying communicable diseases--
No, no, no.
It's sensual.
Oh. Didn't know. Okay. Okay.
Oh, no!
I'm sorry, it's the hospital.
The food looks great. maybe save me some?
I can't promise anything.
We're really gonna do this, huh?
Looks like it.
Y'know, If this is too weird for you, you can still back out--
" Got it! 'Okay
Susan, hi. Hey.
Thank you so much for coming. I wouldn't have missed it for the world.
I'm-I'm Ross by the way.
Hello, Ross.
I love what you've done with this space. Thank you so much. Heh.
How hot is this?
I'm sorry you're here with me instead of Roger.
Yeah, me too.
Well, I could make it seem like he's here.
"Here's some little-known facts about cous-cous:
They didn't add the second 'cous' until 1979."
Stop it! That's not funny! Okay.
I'm sorry, okay? It's just...
...tonight was supposed to be, you know, it was supposed to be a big deal.
What was tonight? You don't want to know what tonight was.
0Kay.
What was tonight?
Tonight was—was going to be my first time.
With Roger?
Not just with Roger? Oh, my God.
All right, relax, Mr. I've-Had-Sex-Four-Times!
Four different women!
I've had sex way more times.
How many?
Nine.
Waiting for the perfect guy.
Well, good. Good for you. You really think Roger's the perfect guy?
No, but he's not a horrible guy.
That's what I tell girls about me.
Chandler, I'm gonna die a virgin!
No, you're not. You are sweet and wonderful...
...and this is gonna happen for you.
Oh, really? When? Do you want to do it with me?
0Kay.
I was kidding.
So was I.
Joey.
You're such an amazing actor.
How do you know where Dr. Drake Ramoray leaves off...
...and Joey Tribbiani begins?
Well, with Dr. Drake...
...they always tell me what to say.
And with Joey, I pretty much have to make it up on my own.
Tell me something Joey. Whoa!
I just fell right off the couch there. Yeah, you did.
I'm okay.
Here you go. Let me ask you a question. Whoops. Yeah.
When was the last time...
...someone told you just how beautiful you are?
I can't feel my hands.
Come on. Come here.
We can't do this. No!
Oyster? Yeah.
If-If! If we did do this, there'd be a lot of pressure on me.
y’know? Because you've been waiting a very long time, and I wouldn't want to disappoint you.
Yeah but see I have nothing to compare it to.
So even if you were horrible, how would I know?
I do like that.
It's harder for me. I have four other women to compete with.
Well, if it helps, there were only three.
So it'd just be for tonight?
Absolutely. It would just be one friend helping out another friend.
Stop it. We're not doing this.
Let's do it! No!
"Okay! "Okay!
So, um...
Do you have any, uh, moves?
I have some moves.
I have no moves. Okay.
Oh, okay, what you doing there?
Oh y'know what? I'm sorry, this is just too weird. Yeah, forget it.
What if I turn out the lights? Okay.
Oh, yeah.
Chandler? Yeah?
That's the couch.
Oh, my God!
I know!
I'll tell you something.
We are gonna do that again!
Ah! Okay.
Morning.
Oh, right. Yeah.
Oh, God.
Oh, I can't believe Joey Tribbiani heard me throw up.
He actually saw you a little bit too.
No.
Oh, God, we-We didn't, uh...?
No. No. no.
Not after seeing that.
God, I'm just a horrible person.
Well, why? Because I'm married.
That's right, I'm a married woman.
I came to a TV star's apartment to have an affair. Ugh!
That's ridiculous.
I'm not a "star."
I'm just a regular famous actor.
And I'm a horrible, horrible person.
Rachel, will you stop saying that?
Hey. Hey, look.
Remember on the show when Capri was dying?
And she gave me-- The ring from the cave. Yeah.
Uh, okay, well...
Oh, my God! They let you keep that stuff?
Sure. As long as they don't find out, you can keep whatever you want.
And I want you to have it.
No, I couldn't. Yes. Yes.
And every time you look at it...
...I want you to remember that you are a good person.
Okay, you've had the chance to cheat...
...and with me.
But you didn't. And that's what this ring stands for.
But I thought that ring stood for Capri's undying love for her brother.
Look, you want the ring or not? Yeah!
Hey, look at you! You're up!
All right. I thought I'd try to take a walk.
You pour me some water. I'll be back soon.
Whoa, whoa. You're not gonna use the pay phone to call work, are you?
No. I've learned my lesson.
Let's go. Come on. Move it.
Phoebe, come on!
Shoes, briefcase. Thanks, Lou. Good luck with the gallbladder.
Hey, Joe...
...did you ever have a threesome?
Well uh, look Ross. I think Carol's great, and I'm sure you're a very attractive man, but...
No, I--
No. The reason I'm asking is that...
...I sort of had one last night.
You? Yeah.
Wow. All right. Yeah.
So? Was it amazing?
It was, heh...
okay.
Just okay? Did you do it right?
Look, it's just, did you ever go to a party and think:
"Would anyone really miss me if I weren't here?"
But still, Ross.
Your worst day with two women, pretty much better than any other day.
Oh, oh, no, absolutely.
Yeah. Yeah.
It's just...
...my part seemed to be over pretty quickly...
...and then there was a lot of waiting around.
But you got to be with both of them, right?
Not really.
Eh, just Carol.
Not the other one? No, she kept kicking me away.
You don't want that. No.
Well hey, at least you got to see a lot of stuff.
Oh, I saw a lot of stuff.
You get a little bored? A little.
Yeah. Made a snack. Yeah?
What'd you have? Just a sandwich.
Turkey. A little mustard.
Sounds good. It really was.
Hey. Hey.
Let me tell you about this chick I scored with last night.
Oh, no, wait a minute, that was you. Heh.
Hey, check me out. I'm a slut!
So you, uh, want to do something tonight?
Oh, I can't. Dr. Roger's coming over again.
Oh. Oh, right. Right.
Because you're still seeing him, and, uh, he's a good guy.
I remember a time...
Are you okay? Yeah, totally.
Totally. Are you?
Great. It's so amazing.
Y'know, Last time Dr. Roger came over, I was so nervous.
But after being with you, I'm like, "Can the doctor see me now?"
I'll bet he can.
"I don't have an appointment, but I sure could use a physical." Ha, ha.
You sure you're okay? Oh yeah! Yeah! Don't worry about me, I'll be fine.
My God! Barry!
You said you'd be away all weekend! Oh!
That's right, I'm sorry. I am early!
Finish, please!
Surprise, look who's back.
Hey, Pheebs. Hey.
Call security.
Pheebs, uh, didn't you get fired?
Heh, I don't think so.
Phoebe? Jack! Hey. Ha,ha.
What are you doing here? All better. Back to work.
Except this clown from research told me I was fired.
He should do his research, huh? Ha-ha-ha.
Well, you were fired.
Nuh-uh.
I told that guy who answered your phone.
Oh, okay. I didn't get that message. So this doesn't count.
Anyway, I'll be in my office. Ah, heh.
Phoebe, you don't have an office.
All right, I'll work right here.
This is good. Next to this plant.
Phoebe, let's-- You're in my office.
Look, I've made a lot of cash for this company. I am talking big bucks!
Pesos! Yen! Rubles! You make one little mistake--
You lost 13 million dollars.
So now this is all about money?
You know, it's bad enough that-- Ow!
Oh, you have got to be kidding.
Are you all right? I'm having another heart attack.
What? I'm having another heart attack!
Call 911!
Dumb-ass!
Pheebs, how's it going?
They fired me, and I'm having a heart attack.
Well, welcome back. Yeah.
Hi, Ross. Hi, Rachel.
Is Joey Tribbiani here? Um, no.
Well, if you see him, will you please tell him that I'm looking for him...
...and that this time I am not gonna throw up!
Are you okay? Me? I'm great!
I'm fine! I'm so good.
But you know who's not great?
Men!
You're a man, right, Ross? Yeah.
Sit down. Okay.
Let me, uh, ask you something.
Do wedding vows mean squat to you people?
And why is it that the second we tell you we're going out of town...
...bam, there you are in bed with the neighbor's dog-walker?
We're sorry.
No, seriously. Seriously. What has happened to the sanctity of marriage?
Didn't you spend last night at Joey's? Oh, what are you, a detective?
I don't know what's going on with you and your husband...
...and what is hopefully an adult dog-walker.
Look, can I just say, not all men are like that.
Ugh. Hey, there are some men...
...who'll do whatever to make their marriage work.
There are some men who will stand by and watch...
...as their wives engage in what can only be described as a "twosome"...
...with some woman she barely knows from the gym!
Who are these men?
Just men. A guy I know.
Well, you might want to tell him it sounds like his wife...
...is gay.
She is not...
She's gay-
Oh, my God.
She is so gay!
I can't believe this.
Good day for married people, huh?
I'm sorry your husband cheated on you.
I'm sorry your wife is gay.
I guess women aren't that great either. Try telling my wife that.
Okay to come in? Yeah, come in, eat, whatever you want.
Dr. Roger got beeped again.
Yeah, I know. Guess who beeped him?
What? I'm the ruptured spleen. Ha, ha!
Why would you do that? Because you shouldn't be with him.
You should be with me.
Really? When you were talking about Roger...
...that was killing me. Look.
Things like last night don't just happen.
At least not to me. I mean, with the other two women...
...in the morning, y'know I was just lying there and I couldn't wait to just go hang outwith my friends.
But with you...
...heh, I was, you know, already with a friend.
Chandler. I know you probably don't want to go out with me.
I make too many jokes, I've never been in a serious relationship...
...and I guess I'm not technically a "doctor."
There was just one woman, wasn't there?
No, there were two.
Including me? Oh, yeah.
It only takes two heart attacks To finally make you see
One of them won't do it But the second will set you free
Tell all your hate and anger. It's time to say goodbye
And that is just what I will do
Soon as those bastards I worked for die
Hey, remember when I had a monkey?
Yeah. Mm-hm.
Yeah. what, What was I thinking?
Hey, so, what's with the 20 percent tip? Did I do something wrong?
Twenty percent is a pretty generous tip. Joe.
You know what's more generous than that? Fifty percent.
You know what's even more generous? I see where you're going.
What's up with the greed, Joe? All right, look, I'm sorry, you guys.
but it's just that I gotta get these new headshots made...
...and they're really expensive, you know.
I'm down to like three.
Actually, two, because one of them I kind of blackened in some teeth.
Why'd I do that? Ugh.
Well, isn't there something you can do to earn a little extra money?
I mean, can't you pick up, I don't know, an extra shift here?
Or, you know, I used to beg for money.
Of course, it helps if you've got, you know, a little of this going on.
Wow, I still have it. Ha, ha. Yeah.
Oh, wait! wait! don't you have an audition today? Yeah. Maybe you'll get that job.
Oh, ha-ha-ha.
Oh, wait a minute.
I used to get medical experiments down on me all the time.
Ah, finally, an explanation.
No, I used to get paid for all kinds of medical stuff, remember?
Let's see. Uh... Well, I don't wanna donate sperm again.
I really prefer doing that at the home office, you know?
Ooh, ooh, maybe they want some of my blood or spit or something, huh?
Joey. Yeah?
What did I tell you about talking to your friends while you're working?
Uh, do it?
That guy's been waiting for his coffee for 1O minutes.
He's complained about you three times.
Well, where was I?
Friends  S06E17  The One With The Unagi
Hey. Hey.
Hey, what have you been up to? Oh. We went to a self-defense class today.
Wow.
Yeah. Kicking a guy in the crotch all morning really takes it out of you.
Takes it out of you? Heh.
No, now we can kick anybody's ass. Yeah.
After one class? I don't think so.
What, you wanna see me self-defend myself?
Go over there and pretend you're a sexual predator.
Go on, I dare you.
Well, Of course you can defend yourself from an attack you know is coming.
That's not enough.
Look, I studied kara-tay for a long time.
And there's a concept you should really be familiar with.
It's what the Japanese call unagi.
Isn't that a kind of sushi?
No, it's a concept. Yeah, it is, it is. It's freshwater eel.
All right, maybe it means that too.
Oh, I would kill for a salmon-skin roll right now.
You know what? Fine, get attacked. I don't even care.
Come on, Ross, we're sorry. Please tell us what it is.
Unagi is a state of total awareness.
Okay? Only by achieving true unagi...
...can you be prepared for any danger that may befall you.
In case someone's trying to steal your bamboo sleeping mat...
...or your kettle of fish?
All I'm saying is, it's one thing being prepared...
...for an attack against, like, each other.
Whole other story being prepared for an attack, I don't know--
A surprise!
All right, you knew that was coming, but that doesn't mean you have unagi.
Ooh! Y'know what? if we made reservations, we could have unagi in about a half-hour.
You know what?
Hey, hey, is Monica here? No.
Okay, look, I need your help. I don't know what to get for Valentine's Day.
Well, Valentine's Day was two weeks ago, so I wouldn't get her a calendar.
Heh. She was working on Valentine's Day, so we're celebrating it tonight.
Oh, hey, why don't you book a day for both of you at one of those romantic spas?
Ooh, Joey, that's actually a really good idea.
Yeah, and of course, crotchless panties.
Well, as appealing as that does sound to her boyfriend...
and her brother.
I can't do that we promised we'd make each other gifts this year.
Oh, I love that. You guys.
You can't make crotchless panties? You take--
You take a pair of scissors and just cut-Okay, okay, okay.
So making things, that sounds so much fun.
Yeah, I thought so to until I paper mached one of my eyes shut.
Oh, I love paper mache! What did you make?
I made a:
What is that? Nothing.
So, what are you gonna do?
Have you guys made anything that maybe I can take credit for?
Ooh, I have, I have. I started making these little sock bunnies.
Oh, for crying out loud.
Hey, wait a minute. That is my sock.
Now it's your little bunny friend.
0Kay.
This, this actually is a...
Hey. Hey, honey.
Can I ask you a question about the Valentine's Day gifts?
Oh, yeah. Do we have to make the entire thing?
Yes. Why, did you—you forget to make yours?
Of course, Of course not.
I just have to, uh, go over to the place where I-I made it and pick-pick it up.
okay. okay
I can't wait. It's gonna be the best Valentine's Day ever.
I can't believe it. Make the presents. Make the presents.
What? Just so excited to make the presents!
Shoot
Hi, I'm Joey Tribbiani.
And with all do respect, I'd like to donate some fluids.
We're actually at the end of one of our research cycles...
...so we're not looking for applicants now.
That's too bad. I've kind of been saving up.
Uh, are you sure there's no studies I can participate in?
Well, here's a schedule of what's coming up.
Ah, thanks.
Oh, but this one starts now.
That one is available now, but only identical twins are eligible.
It's a twin study. But it's $2000.
Sorry. Oh.
Well, how about this one?
"Testing the Effects of Joey Tribbiani on Attractive Nurse Receptionists."
We already got the results back on that one, and they're not good.
That was good. Wasn't that a blast?
Danger! Danger! God, Ross!
What the hell was that?
A lesson in the importance of unagi.
You're a freak.
Perhaps.
Now, I'm curious.
At what point during those girlish screams would you have begun to kick my ass?
All right, so we weren't prepared.
I'm sorry I had to take such drastic measures to make my point.
But, but I—look, I just want you guys to be safe.
Danger!
Ah, huh? Unagi.
Two thousand bucks is a lot of money.
Oh, I wish I had a twin.
Where could I find someone...
...who looks exactly like me?
Hey.
Chandler.
I sensed it was you.
What?
Unagi.
I'm always aware.
Okay, are you aware that unagi is an eel?
What's up? I can't figure out what to make Monica.
Oh. Why don't you make her one of your little jokes?
I'm going crazy, okay?
Do you have anything around here that looks homemade?
Oh, you know what? She'd love this.
It's an exact replica of Apollo 8. I made it in the sixth grade.
Yeah, I guess I could use that. I could say, "Your love sends me to the moon."
Yeah, yeah. Except Apollo 8 didn't actually land on the moon.
But you could write, urn:
"Your love lets me orbit the moon twice and return safely."
Wait, I can't give this to her.
Why not? It says "Captain Ross" on the side.
And it says "I hate Monica" on the bottom. Oh.
Danger! Aah!
Ah. Salmon-skin roll.
Okay, okay.
Yes, honey, I made it myself.
I can't do it. I can't do it.
Oh, oh. A mixed tape. A mixed tape.
Hey, hi. Hey.
You ready to exchange gifts? Sure. Okay, you go first.
Okay, come here, come here. Okay.
Okay, now, it's not wrapped, because I just finished it.
0Kay.
But I made you a tape of what I think are all romantic songs.
What a great gift.
Is "The Way You Look Tonight" on it?
Maybe. We'll have to listen and see.
Oh, I love it. Thank you so much. Mwah. Aw. Okay. Mwah.
Okay, you ready to open yours?
Yeah. Okay.
It's a sock bunny.
Ha, ha. Yeah, yeah. Remember how I call you "bunny"?
Not really.
Well, I did one time. And I wanna start doing it more.
See that's what this is about. I see.
You know, urn, Phoebe makes sock bunnies.
No. No, she doesn't.
Phoebe, what she makes, that's-They're sock rabbits.
They're completely different. Okay, okay. Okay!
Okay, I didn't make it. I'm sorry. I totally forgot about tonight...
...and that we were supposed to make the presents.
Oh, it's okay. I don't-No, no, it's not okay. It's not.
I mean you were just... You're so incredible!
You went through all this time and effort to make this tape for me.
You know, I'm just gonna-I'm gonna make this up to you. I will.
I am going to cook you anything you want in here.
And I'm going to do anything you want in there.
Well, I did put a lot of thought into the tape.
You are way too young to have seen that. Oops. Ha, ha.
Your birthday's in a month and a half.
What do you say I forget to get you a present for that too?
You are totally and completely 100 percent forgiven.
We have got to wash that. Yeah.
Hey, do you remember that jacket that you loved so much...
...that you thought was too expensive? You have done enough.
Ha, ha. I'm gonna wake up early and get it for you.
No, you don't have-Get it in black, not brown.
Oop. Your cake is ready. Oop.
It's like that old saying, "have some sex, eat some cake."
Hey, Mon. Hey, Chan. Just getting a soda.
Who the hell are you?
I'm Joey.
How are you doing?
No, no, no!
Mow you doing?
"How you doing?" Damn it, Carl. Go wait in the hall.
Look, I got to apologize on behalf of Carl. Who the hell is Carl?
Oh, did I not mention?
Carl is a guy I hired to be my identical twin for a medical research project.
You know, sometimes the good ideas are just right in front of you, aren't they?
Look, I know it sounds crazy, but I think it might work.
But the only problem is Carl's acting is:
The only problem?
Yeah. He's the reason I didn't get that big Minute Maid commercial a couple of years ago remember?
We were supposed to be brothers, but he messed it up.
Hey. Can I get a little piece of that cake?
Pizza. We like pizza. Get out!
Pat Sajak? Yep.
Alex Trebek? Oh, of course.
Chuck Woolery? Definitely.
Phoebe, you will not find a single game-show host...
...whose ass I cannot kick.
Say it. Say we are unagi.
It's not something you are, it's something you have.
Say it.
I could easily get out of this...
...but there's a chance you could get very, very hurt.
All right, Carl, we're next. Now, remember, what is this not gonna be?
Another Minute Maid fiasco. That's right.
And what are you not gonna do?
I'm not gonna talk, because-Ah. Damn it, Carl.
Can I have the next one, please?
Thank you.
Joey and Tony Tribbiani.
That's us.
But, uh, this is a study for identical twins.
That's right. Two thousand dollars.
But you're not identical twins.
Damn it, Carl.
Oh, my good God.
Hey. Continuing the countdown of your favorite meals.
Tonight, number three:
macaroni and cheese with cut-up hot dogs.
Look, you have done enough, okay? You have to stop this now.
I will, but not tonight.
For dinner music, I thought we could listen to that tape that you made me.
Oh, the mixed tape. Mm-hm.
Oh. "The Way You Look Tonight" is on here.
Dance with me.
You are just the sweetest.
I love the way you look every night, Chandler.
That's why I made you this tape.
Happy birthday. Love, Janice. Mwah.
No, you're the sweetest.
Okay, ladies, that ends today's class. Let's remember, let's be safe out there.
Great class. Heh. Thanks, man.
Yeah, yeah. I was watching.
Um, hey, a couple of questions, though.
Um, you know that last move...
...where that woman tripped you and then pinned you to the floor?
What would you do next?
Well, then she'd take her keys and jam them in your--
No, no, no. What would you do next?
Who, me, the attacker? Yes, that's right.
Why?
I tried attacking two women. Did not work.
What? No, I mean, it's okay.
I mean, they're my friends. In fact, I was married to one of them.
Let me get this straight. You attacked your ex-wife?
Oh, no, no, no. Heh.
I tried.
But I couldn't. That's why I'm here.
Maybe we could attack them together.
That's a no.
I am so, so, so sorry.
Oh! And I will cook anything you want in here...
...and do anything you want in there.
Yeah, you will, and are you kidding me?
Come on, Monica, it's our Valentine's Day.
Please, please, please?
okay. okay
So are we going in there? I am.
Nowhere to run.
I don't like sitting up here. I'm gonna go over--
No, Rachel, they got here first.
Why is Ross doing that? Danger!
Oh, my God. Why is he jumping on those women?
We should help them.
I don't think they need any help.
Hey.
I just got my teacher evaluations. Check out what this one student wrote.
"I loved Dr. Geller's class. Mind-blowing lectures.
Dr. Geller, you are definitely the hottie of the Paleontology Department."
Ah, "Hotties of the Paleontology Department."
There's a big-selling calendar, huh?
Who wrote it?
Oh, I wish I knew, but the evaluations are all anonymous.
Do you still have their final exams? Yeah.
Oh,‘cause you can just match the evaluation to the exam with the same handwriting and boom, there's your admirer.
A hot girl's at stake and all of a sudden he's Rain Man.
Hey, wait a minute, wait a minute. Why are we so sure that this is a girl?
It's a girl.
Anyway, it wouldn't matter, okay?
Because I'm a teacher. She's a student. Oh, is that against the rules?
No, but it is frowned upon. I see.
Besides, there's a big age difference. Think of it like this. When you're 90--
I know, when I'm 90, she'll be 80...
..and it won't seem like such a big difference.
No, that's not what I was gonna say at all.
What I was gonna say is when you're 90...
...you'll still have the memory of what it was like to be with a 20-year-old.
Friends  S06E18  The One Where Ross Dates A Student
Hey Chandler! you know that girl you went to college with who became a movie director?
Oh, yeah, Dana Keystone. She was in my movement class.
What's a movement class?
It's Chandler's way of pretending he didn't take mime.
Oh well listen, anyway, she's directing the new Al Pacino movie.
You gotta get me an audition. Oh. I don't know man.I haven't talked to her in like 10 years.
Oh, no, no, no. please-please Chandler I-I-I would owe you so much.
You do owe me so much. You owe me 3400--
Hey, hey, dude. Why you changing the subject? What?
Will you make the call or what? Okay, I'll try.
All right. Thanks, you're the best.
The last day of auditions is Thursday, so I gotta get in by Thursday.
Just remember Thursday. Thursday. Can you remember Thursday?
Yeah, so Tuesday?
Thursday. Look, if you need help remembering, just think of it like this.
The third day. All right? Monday, one day.
Tuesday, two day.
Wednesday, when, huh, what day? Thursday.
The third day, okay?
Thank you. Okay.
Hey, Mon, I'm gonna check my messages. You just thought of that in there?
Sure, you know, nature called. She wants to see who else did.
Hello?
Uh...
Rachel.
You guys, someone is in our apartment. Call the cops.
You're on the phone.
Oh, my God. What?
Oh, my God. Thank you. That was the Fire Department.
There was a fire at our place. Oh, my God. How bad was it?
He didn't say, but it was a fire. I'm guessing not very good.
Come on, we gotta go. Phoebe, come on.
What are you smiling about? What is so funny?
The part I wanna audition for is a fireman. This is so meant to be.
Wow. Looks like you were very generous with your grades this semester.
Professor Geller? Yeah? Huh?
I wanted to say how much I enjoyed your class.
Oh, thank you. Thanks very much. Ow.
I'm a little embarrassed about calling you a hottie on my evaluation.
That was you? Yeah.
I felt a little weird about it. You're a teacher. I'm a student.
But would you maybe wanna go out with me sometime?
Oh, I-Heh. I don't think that would be the best idea.
Oh, because I was thinking, um, the semester's over.
You're not my teacher anymore. What time?
Oh, you know what? Forget it. I see you already gave me an A.
Gotcha. I'm kidding. Ha-ha-ha.
Oh. Ha-ha-ha. Ha-ha-ha.
So seriously, what time?
Coming through. Oh. Coming through. Oh. Hello. Hi.
No, right. Corning through.
Oh. Okay. Well, it's not so bad.
Yeah, Most of the damage is pretty mostly contained to the bedrooms.
Oh, my God.
Hey, buddy, you think I could borrow your uniform this Thursday?
Excuse me? Joey. He's working.
You would look good in that.
Uh-oh. How bad is it? Oh, it's bad, it's really bad.
The only thing that isn't burned is an ax, which I do not remember buying.
How's your room, Rach? Everything's ruined.
My bed, my clothes. Look at my favorite blue sweater.
Isn't that mine?
Fine. I'm sorry for your loss.
So uh, you're not gonna be able to live here for a while.
You ladies have a place to stay? Oh. Wow.
Okay, look, pal...
...I am not in the mood to be hit on right now.
But if you give me your number, I will call you some other time.
Yes, they can stay with us.
Have you figured out what started the fire, Mr. Fireman?
Well, uh, do either of you smoke?
No, not usually.
But yeah, I could use one now. Thanks. No, no.
Do you light candles, burn incense? Yes, I do all the time. I love them.
Oh, my God, I did it. It's me, it's me.
I burned down the house. I burned down the house!
Okay, Phoebe, calm down. There's no need to place blame. Okay?
I warned her about those candles.
It's great to catch up. I can't believe how long it's been.
Hey, Chandler, is that...?
Oh, that's great. Good for you. So, hey, hey, is it...?
Okay, so, yeah, maybe we can get together, um...
Can you hold on for one second, please?
What?
When you're off the phone, you wanna get a pizza?
Hi, I'm back.
Yeah, that sounds great. Okay, well, we'll do it then. Okay, bye.
Hey, listen, so when's my audition? I know it's Thursday, but what time?
Hi. We didn't get to the audition.
I'm gonna take her to coffee and do it then. Ah.
Wow, so now you're going on a date with this girl?
Not a date. I haven't talked to her in 10 years.
You can't call somebody you haven't talked to in 10 years and ask for a favor.
There are rules, you know? You gotta put in some time.
You're right, I'm sorry.
It's not like you're going out with an ex. No, we only went out once.
You dated her?
Not once.
Great. Why don't I just go outwith an ex, you know, and do Joey a favor?
Hey, you wanna do Joey a favor? Maybe you go out with Joey.
Oh. That's great. My friend Joey's in the movie business.
Mm. You know who I ran into from school? Howie.
Hmm. My friend's name is Joey. Heh.
Apparently, Howie's editing now.
Yeah, he calls me up and asks me if he can edit my new movie.
Heh. Can you believe that?
You know, I haven't spoken to him in, what, 10 years...
...and he asks me for a favor?
Yeah, I've always hated that Howie.
No "How you doing?" Heh.
Man, I mean, not even a cup of coffee first.
Heh. The nerve, huh? Yeah.
Refill?
Now, this is last-minute, so I want to apologize for the mess.
Oh.  Who cares?
Oh, my God.
It sure didn't look this way when I lived here.
I know.
Now look, There's only one problem, though.
There's only room for one, so I guess one of you will have to stay at Joey's.
Well, since the fire was kind of my fault, I guess you should get to stay here.
Hey, hey, hey, now.
this was no one's fault, Pheebs, okay? It was an accident.
Well no, It was my fault. You should get the nice room.
Okay. Whoo!
So, Rach, you're the first guest at Hotel Monica.
Hotel Monica.
Umm, you'll just have to tell me how you like your eggs in the morning.
I thought I'd bring them to you, you know, in bed.
Aw. You've been through so much.
I have.
This right here is where I keep the pizza.
And that's where the napkin is.
What's that smell? I know. I don't...
Oh, please, it was such a big class. You never even noticed me.
What? Of course I did. You sat next to Sleepy Sleeperson.
Who?
Oh. I had trouble remembering everyone's names...
...so I came up with nicknames.
Like the guy on the other side of you was Smelly von Brown-Shirt.
Oh, yeah. Ha, ha.
So, um, did you have a nickname for me? Uh, no. No.
Yes, you did. What was it?
Um, it's...
Cutie McPretty.
Oh, that's so sweet.
Listen, I gotta tell you, I'm having a great time.
You know how before you said it might be weird, the whole student-teacher thing?
And to be frank, I thought it would be too. But it's not. I mean, it's not at all.
Dr. Geller. Burt.
So did you sleep well last night?
I did. Yeah?
I did. Monica was so sweet. She left a little mint on my pillow.
Know what Joey left on my pillow?  What?
Gum.
Well, we determined the cause of the fire. Yeah, I know. It was my candle, my candle.
No, there was an appliance left on in the bathroom.
It looks like a curling iron.
I don't use a curling iron. Well, someone does.
Well, don't look at me! my hair's straight. Straight, straight, straight.
It could've been a hair-straightener. Oh.
This is where I keep the pizza.
And-Hey, where'd the napkin go?
There you go. I wouldn't want my best guest to strain her eyes.
Thanks, Monica.
Does that smell bother you? What, the smell from Joey's?
No, I can hardly smell it over here.
Well, you let me know if you can. Because I can bake a pie to cover it.
I can smell it a little. Bake the pie. Okay.
Hello?
Oh, yes, one minute, please. It's for you. It's the fire inspector.
Oh. Hello? Yeah, this is Phoebe.
Really?
Yeah, so it turns out that it wasn't the hair-straightener...
...that started the fire.
No, no. It was the candles.
Yeah. It's very not good leaving candles unattended.
In fact, one of the first things they teach you in fire school is--
Uh...
Uh, okay, well, I have to go now.
We had such a great time. She's incredible.
I thought the age difference might be a problem, but it wasn't.
It wasn't at all. Elizabeth is very mature for her age.
A concept lost on some people.
So it's okay to date a student?
Well, not really.
I mean, technically, it's not against the rules or anything.
But it is frowned upon...
...especially by that professor we ran into last night.
Judgy von Holier-Than-Thou.
Well Ross, you be careful now. 
You don't wanna get a reputation as y'know Professor McNails-His-Students. Ha, ha.
Yeah. What should I do? Well, Ross, it seems pretty clear.
I mean, what's more important, what people think or how you feel? Huh?
Ross, you gotta follow your heart. Joey, that is so sweet.
Hey. Hey, hey. So how'd it go with Dana?
Any reason I should leave a block of time open, say, Thursday?
I couldn't do it. You couldn't do it?
Relax, I just need more time. We're going to dinner.
What? You're going outwith her again?
Going out with who? Dana Keystone, from college.
Oh, yeah. Wasn't she, uh, mm...?
No, that was Dana Kaplan.
Oh. Ah.
Joey, you didn't even know her. Yeah, whatever.
Great story again.
The yarns that you weave.
You know, uh, actually, I should get going.
Oh, no, no, no, stay, stay, because you should--
You should stay.
Oh, I am really flattered.
But I just... I don't feel that way about you.
Oh, no, no, no. That's not-No, no, no. I'm sorry, Chandler.
You know, you are such a sweet guy, and I don't wanna hurt you.
Oh, I wish there were something I could do to make you feel better.
No, no, no-Really?
Of course.
Well, it just hurts so bad, I, uh...
Oh, I'm sorry.
Well, maybe there is one thing you can do. What? Anything. Anything.
Well, I mean, this is just off the top of my head now. Um...
Ahem. But I have this friend, uh, this actor friend...
...and he would kill me if he knew that I was doing this, um...
...but, um, would it be possible for him to get an audition for your movie...
...say, on Thursday?
Absolutely.
But you'd really feel better about me rejecting you...
...if your friend can audition for my movie?
Well, the heart wants what it wants. I'll see you later.
Hey. How's it going?
Well, not much has changed in the last five minutes.
Yes, it has. I made cookies.
That's all right. I'm still full from your homemade potato chips, so...
Oh. But you should eat them now because they're hot from the oven.
Okay. Oh. But not in here.
Can't eat them in bed, remember? No crummies.
Oh.
I'll be out in a second.
0Kay.
What are you doing? This doesn't lock, does it'?
Oh. Joey, sorry. Oh. Oh, it's all right, don't worry about it.
No, but look. Oh, that's gonna leave a stain.
Rach, hey, it's fine. You're at Joey's.
Really? Yeah, look.
I've never lived like this before. I know.
All right, well, don't waste it. I mean, it's still food.
What do you wanna do now, huh? You wanna go get a drink?
Uh, I can't.
Oh, you have some studying to do? No, I have some turning 21 to do.
Okay. Ha, ha.
You know, I remember when I was in college, we used to--
What are you doing? Nothing, I'm just--
I'm so comfortable with you.
Do you not wanna be seen with me? What?
No, of course I do. Are they gone?
No, they're still here. But I think I'm about to leave.
What? No, no, wait, wait.
You're right, this is stupid. Who cares what people think?
I mean, we like each other, right? There's nothing wrong with that.
Come on.
Burt. Lydia. Mel.
This is Elizabeth. Hi.
Aren't you in my Popular Culture class?
That's right, Lydia. Elizabeth here is a student.
And we're dating.
And you may frown upon that...
...but we're not gonna hide it anymore.
You are so fired.
What? They're gonna fire you.
You can't date a student. It's against the rules.
Really? It's not just frowned upon?
Oh. Ah. Ah!
I love it at Joey's.
There you go.
Ooh. Thanks. Nice.
So you busy Thursday? Oh, very funny.
I don't know if you remember, but my audition was supposed to be Thursday.
You got me the audition?
Yeah. Oh, let's hug it up.
Okay, okay, okay.
What are you gonna do to me if you get the part?
Hey. Hey.
Hi. Hi.
Yeah, okay, I need to talk to you. Uh-huh.
Now, I know that they said that the hair-straightener started the fire...
...but I think I'm partly at fault.
You see, I didn't tell you, but, um, I had recently refilled the tissues.
And so, you know, let's face it, that's just kindling.
So I think it's better that I stay at Joey's.
No, no, no, Phoebe, this was my fault.
Besides, you know what? I'm fine here. Okay.
Oh, Chandler, Monica's looking for you. Really?
Yeah, she said something about crummies. No, no, no. I was so careful.
Okay. You have to switch with me. Monica is driving me crazy.
That's right. All the ladies wanna stay at Joey's.
No, Phoebe, come on, I don't wanna switch.
Please. Come on, I can throw wet paper towels here.
No, but at Monica's, you can eat cookies over the sink.
I know. I'm sorry.
All right, fine.
This looks like so much fun. Ha, ha.
God, what a mess.
Wow, it actually is in the handbook.
I can't date you or have a hot plate in my office.
Oh, I can't believe we have to stop seeing each other.
For what it's worth, I did appreciate you standing up for me.
That felt really nice.
Kind of made me like you even more.
I know, I know. I really like you too. But we can't date.
It's against the rules. It's forbidden.
What? Just hearing you describe it...
...as forbidden, it's really hot.
Really?
Yeah.
Well, I don't care how hot it is, it's, uh-it's wrong.
Stop it. No, no. It's wrong. it's--
It's naughty.
It's...
...taboo.
Shut the book.
Hey. Let's also get a hot plate. Oh.
Hey. Hey.
So? So...?
It's Thursday. How was the audition? It's Thur--?
Monday, one day. Tuesday, two day. Wednesday, when, huh, what day? Thur--
Well, that thing's clearly in the way.
All right. A-ha. Heh.
Damn fridge!
Hi, Joey. How you doing? Great...
...roomie. Ah!
Yeah, I guess we are roommates now. Yeah! Well, now that you brought it up...
...uh, our fridge is broken. We have to get a new one.
Now, I checked around and your half is $400. Thanks a lot.
I'm not paying for half of that.
I'm only staying here until my apartment gets fixed.
Look, Rach, my parents bought this fridge just after I was born. Okay?
Now, I have never had a problem with it. Then you show up and it breaks!
What does that tell you?
That refrigerators don't live as long as people?
All right, now you know that the ATM only lets you take out 300 at a time...
...so I'll take a check for the other 100.
Heh. You're joking, right?
Of course I'm joking. I don't take checks.
Thank God you're pretty.
Friends  S06E19  The One With Joey's Fridge
Hey! Hey.
Hey, do You guys know any cute guys?
Well, of course, I do. My good friend, Joey, over here.
Oh, I'm sorry. Thank you, Chandler.
Anyway, there's this big charity ball this weekend and Ralph Lauren bought a table...
...so I kind of have to go.
What's the charity? I don't know.
Something, either trees or disease,
Ralph mumbles a lot.
Does Ralph mumble when you're not paying attention? Yeah. It's weird.
But the thing is, I need to find a date.
Well, What kind of guy are you looking for?
Well, Someone that has his own tux or has the ability to rent a tux.
So he has to be a male who has at least $50.
Ooh, so close.
Hey, everybody. Hey.
Uh, this is Elizabeth. Hi, Elizabeth.
I'm the student. Ha-ha-ha.
Isn't she cute?  No.
Y'know, this is probably none of my business, but weren't you guys supposed...
...to not be seen in public together? Oh, we're not together.
No. We're just two people who happen to have run into each other...
...here at the coffee house. Heh, this is--
Oh, sly.
Well, I really wanted to meet you guys, but I have to run.
I'll see you later? Okay.
Bye, Ross. Bye. See you.
Oops! I did not mean to run into you like that, sir. That is quite all right, ma'am.
Bye.
So why's she leaving? Is it a school night and she has a lot of homework to do?
Yes. Her molecular epidemiology paper is due tomorrow.
Well, tell her "good luck" with that.
Anyone else, huh? Bring them on.
Oh! When's her birthday? I don't know, Rachel. Why?
Well, you know it's just been so long since I've been to Chuck E. Cheese.
I like Elizabeth. Well, thanks.
In fact, I like her so much that you tell her I want my cookies early this year.
Y'know, A box of Thin Mints and some Tag-a-longs.
Hey-hey come on you guys, give him a break. Ross, seriously, how's it going with her?
Well, actually it's been great.
She's 20, so she's not looking for anything too serious...
...which is perfect for me right now.
Well, that is great. And seriously, she seems very nice.
Thanks. I know you guys like to give me a hard time and all,
...but it really means a lot to me that you like her.
Just knowing that you guys are, like. Okay, I got a good one.
Okay, um-Heh.
What is she, like, 12?
Chandler, do you think we talk about our relationship enough?
Yeah. Do we have any Fruit Roll Ups?
Hey. Hey.
Okay, I just thought of the perfect guy for Rachel to take to her thing.
Oh that's so funny, we found someone too.
Oh that's good. I guess she'll have a choice between my guy and your weirdo.
Why would our guy be a weirdo? Because that's just your taste.
See, Rachel's not gonna pick your stupid guy.
Oh, yeah? Yeah.
My guy is a lawyer who does volunteer work.
And he has one of these.
A face ass?
A chin dimple. Well, uh, our guy works with Chandler.
And he's really nice and smart and he's a great dresser.
Have you seen your guy's body? No. Our guy's just a floating head.
Well, my guy is spectacular, okay? He's a massage client.
And one time, um, when he was on the table, I looked at it. And I mean, all of it.
You're not supposed to look. Yeah, like there are police for that.
Wait! you look? You massaged me. I know.
All right, your guy may have a great body, but our guy...
is really funny. Chandler funny?
Our guy's a great dancer. My guy's well-read.
Our guy has great hair. My guy has great teeth.
Our guys smells incredible.
Do you want our guy to be your guy?
Hey. Hey.
Well, you don't look good, Joe.
Well, the fridge broke, so I had to eat everything.
Cold cuts, ice cream, limes.
Hey, what was in that brown jar?
That's still in there? Not anymore.
Ahem, so, anyway, how do you want to pay me?
Is this a service you're providing me?
No, for my new fridge. For our new fridge.
Our new fridge?
I don't live here anymore. So what?
Look, okay, suppose we were a, uh, divorced couple.
Uh-huh. And I got custody of the kid. Right?
Now, suppose the kid dies and I gotta buy a new kid.
0Kay.
Give me $400!
Professor Geller? Hmm?
Oh, a student I don't know.
I was wondering if I could talk to you for a moment?
Yes, of course. What would this be regarding?
Making out in your office. Wh-Shh!
Uh, of course. Why don't we go inside.
Mm-Oh, oh.
What? Doorknob. Doorknob.
Sorry. Ha-ha-ha.
Um, I actually do need to talk to you. Oh. Okay, what about?
Spring vacation. Spring vacation?
Yeah, we have time off, and a lot of people are going on trips--
Professor Geller. Yes, Professor Fiesenstinlender?
I'll be with you in one moment.
So I will take one box of the Thin Mints.
You don't understand. Elizabeth was about to ask me to go on a trip with her.
Is that taking it slow? I'm not ready for this, okay?
What do I tell her? Tell her the truth. You're not ready.
I could do that.
Well, what if she gets upset? Then you distract her with a Barbie doll.
Or...
...you could just, you know, you...
What the hell are you doing?
What?
What the hell am I doing? You just broke my fridge!
What? How do you know if-How do you know it's even broken?
Oh, you think I don't know what breaks my fridge?
Excuse me.
Well, what do you know? Broken!
That'll be $400.
Joey, I saw you push him.
You pushed him.
Joey, I did not break this. Okay? That has been broken for a while.
All right. Chandler, do you remember how I told you about our fridge? Uh-huh.
I still haven't gotten the check for your half yet.
Do not give him any money.
I'm not talking to you! You broke my fridge!
You wanted to see me, Professor Geller? Yes. Yes. Please come in.
Mm, ooh, ooh.
Doorknob? Yeah. It kind of grows on you.
Actually, I wanted to finish talking to you about spring vacation.
Oh, good.
Look, L...
Look, I've been having a great time with you.
And I just don't want us to move too fast or put too much pressure on us.
So I'm sorry, I just don't think we should go away together yet.
It's too soon.
Uh, Ross, I think you misunderstood what I was saying.
I just wanted to tell you that I'm going to Florida for a couple weeks.
No.
I think you misunderstood what I was saying.
What I meant was... You are so adorable.
That. Let's talk about that.
Hey. Hey.
How did it go with Elizabeth? Huh? Oh, oh.
it was fine. It was just a misunderstanding. She didn't want me to go with her.
She just wanted to let me know that she's going to Florida for spring vacation.
Wait, is she going for spring vacation or going for spring break.
What's the difference?
A spring vacation, you're doing nice things with your grandparents.
Spring break, you're doing frat guys.
Hey, you know what? Not all spring breaks are like that.
What did you do on yours? I went to Egypt with my dad.
I can see it now. "Look, Dad, it's the Sphinx."
I think Elizabeth is a little more serious than, "Spring break!"
All right? Come on, she's taking my class.
And slept with the professor. I'm gonna call her.
Hey, you guys, I want you to meet Sebastian.
Hi. We just, uh--
We just met at the newsstand. We both grabbed for the last Field and Stream. Ha!
What, I read that.
Can I get you a cup of coffee? Oh, yes. Thank you.
Rachel, what the hell is this? What?
You ask us to find you a guy, and then you come in here with a guy of your own.
You found me a guy? Yes.
We found you a really cute, funny guy from Chandler's work.
Yeah, and I found you one, too, who is not a weirdo.
You know what though, guys, I really appreciate that...
...but I'm just gonna take Sebastian to the charity.
Are you sure? Because our guy smells incredible.
Would you stop it with that already?
Here you go. Sure. Oh, thank you.
So, Sebastian, do you do any volunteer work?
Uh, no, not really. Why? No reason.
It's just I know a single guy who does care about other people.
Are you funny?
Excuse me? What are you guys doing?
Are you funny? Tell us a joke!
Look, I just wanted to have coffee with Rachel.
Well, so do a lot of people.
Actually, uh, I gotta get going. Oh, but you--
Give me a call sometime. But you didn't give me your number.
Okay, see you later.
Turns out he is kind of funny.
I cannot believe you guys!
He was really nice and he just left because of you!
Yeah, but, "Sebastian"? What is that, a cat's name?
You know what I noticed, Rachel, he scares easy.
Now, is that the kind of guy you want to take to a ball?
"Sebastian, would you like to dance?"
"Uh, okay. I gotta go. Aah!"
All right, guys stop it. Rachel, we're very sorry.
That is a very insensitive thing for us to do.
You know what? Let us make it up to you. We've two really great guys for you.
Yeah, what have you got to lose?
Y'know you might even end up with someone really special. If you pick my guy.
All right. Okay. So you will meet our guys?
Yes, I'll meet them.
It doesn't matter which one you choose. y'know? It's completely up to you.
Our guy is perfect.
Or you could go out with the guy Phoebe deemed...
...not good enough to go outwith herself. Ugh!
Phoebe, there you are! Okay, you broke my fridge.
You owe me 400 bucks.
Okay, sure. Really?
Ooh, technically, you owe me $600 for sending out happy thoughts...
...on your last 10 auditions.
Call it even?
0Kay.
There you are. So, what did Elizabeth say?
Well, turns out she is going to Daytona for "spring break, woo-hoo."
That means wet T-shirt contests, guys doing shots off of girls' bodies...
...waking up next to people you don't even know.
Man, she is gonna have a great time!
Is she staying at the Hotel Corona?
You know the hotels? Sure! I was there, Spring Break '81! Woo-hoo!
In 1981, you were 13.
So what? I drove down, sold T-shirts. I had a blast.
And y'know who knows how to party? Drunk college chicks.
Okay, she can't go.
Ross, You can't tell her not to go. You just started dating.
Then what am I supposed to do? Nothing. Just be cool with it.
What if she goes down there and sleeps with a bunch of guys?
Well, maybe you don't marry this one.
I'm so glad you're going on this trip.
Yeah, I've been working so hard this semester.
I really need to go crazy, you know? Blow off some steam.
Sure. Sure.
Look, I don't know if your plans are finalized yet...
...but I know another great way to blow off steam.
What? Are you into crafts at all?
Ross, are you okay? Uh, yeah. Of course I'm okay.
Heh, I'm just being, uh, supportive.
Supportive of you and this whole trip...
...and what-What is, uh--? What's this?
It's a bathing suit? To wear in front of people?
Is that supportive? Is this?
Hey. Good, good, good.
Hey. Hi.
We're glad you decided to meet our guy. Oh.
You're gonna like him so much.
So umm, when do you want to meet him? I don't know.
I don't work late tomorrow night. Tomorrow night is good.
but uh, y'know what? why put off something till tomorrow that you can do right now. Ha-ha-ha.
Eldad, come here! What?
Eldad, this is Rachel. How are you?
A little blind-sided, but, you know, good.
Eldad, sit down. Move over. Move over now.
There you go. There you are.
Okay! Okay! we can take a hint! Ha-ha-ha.
Wait. What are you doing here? This is Patrick.
Hi. Hi.
Okay, you're too late okay? because she's already with our guy.
Oh, my God, you're right, I am too late. They're sitting on the couch and talking.
Come on.
Rachel?  Yeah?  This is Patrick. Yeah?
Oh. Hi. Hi.
This is the guy I was telling you about.
Believe me, this suit does not do justice to what's underneath it.
0Kay.
But Pheebs, Yeah? I'm just sort of in the middle of something.
Oh, okay. That's okay. Have a seat.
You can't do that! Maybe I should go.
Just sit down, we're winning.
Okay, you know what? Maybe I should go.
No, no! Have a Seat! Have a seat!
Rachel, Rachel, you haven't touched Eldad's hair.
It is the softest hair. Touch it. Yeah, I'm good.
Rachel, Patrick is really rich. Give her some money.
Y'know what Phoebe? this isn't really worth the free massage.
That's right, Patrick. Bye-bye.
Eldad is much more cooperative and he can dance.
You dance for Rachel.
No-no! don't dance for me, please! Don't!
What is the matter with you guys'?
Yeah, okay, let's talk it out.
Am I the only one that this is embarrassing for?
I'm a little embarrassed. Shh, shh.
I'll tell you who should be embarrassed. It's you guys. Come on! This is ridiculous!
Thank you very much, but I do not need you to get me a date.
Then why did she ask us to help-I am still talking!
Then you chase away the one guy that I actually liked.
I mean, no offense to you guys. Really, congratulations on...
...all the cash.
And you really-Wow, you do have very soft hair.
But I'd much rather go to the ball all by myself than go through any more of this!
Good bye.
Now, do you use some sort of special conditioner on that hair?
Yes, papaya extract. Thank you.
So, uh, have a great time down there. I will.
Did you pack that bathing suit? Yeah.
It was pretty funny when I hid it for a while, huh?
Anyway. Um...
I am worried about that bathing suit.
Not because it's revealing, which I'm fine with.
No, I'm concerned about your health.
Um, sun exposure.
Oh, don't worry, I have plenty of sun block.
It's SPF 30. All right.
Well, if what's in the bottle is actually 30.
I mean, sometimes you get 30, sometimes it's 4, and I swear...
...more often than not, it's just milk.
Ross, it's gonna be okay.
I'm not going down there to hook up with a bunch of guys.
I really like you. I like how things are going between us.
Really? Yeah.
I'm just going down there to relax and hang outwith my friends.
Okay. Cool. Heh.
Oh, here they are. Hey, Elizabeth!
Bye!
Call me!
Rachel, we're sorry for pushing those guys on you.
That's all right. I ended up having a really good time.
Y'know, the charity was a big success, they raised a lot of money and awareness.
So, what was it for, anyway?
I wanna say a disease.
Hey. Hey.
I just got this weird message from Ross. He said turn on MTV. I don't know.
Oh, my God, look! That's Elizabeth! Ha-ha-ha.
Oh, oh, Professor Geller.
Ah, to be 13 again. Yeah.
"We've got three minutes till the reactor blows.
We'll never make it!"
"You've got to get out of here! Save yourself!"
"No, I won't leave you."
"Don't worry about me. I'm a robot. I'm just a machine!"
"No, you're not. Not to me." Oh, my God.
What? I am extremely talented.
Yeah. You're great. Yeah.
Okay, let's take it from... No, I mean, I was really acting my ass off.
I thought I was pretty good too.
Yeah, you're solid. You're just no me.
You know what? I think that's enough for now.
I don't want to be over-rehearsed. Ha-ha-ha.
Fine. I'll do it without you!
I don't need you or anybody else!
I'm gonna make it on my own!
You'll see! You'll all see!
Friends  S06E20  The One With Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.
So, what's this thing you're auditioning for?
It's a new TV show. Yeah.
I'm up for the part of Mac, Machiavelli, or "Mac"!
I'm a detective and I solve crimes with the help of my robot partner.
He's a computerized, humanoid...
...electronically enhanced secret enforcer.
Or, "C.H.E.E.S.E."
So, Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.? That's the title!
They really lucked out that the initials spell "cheese."
That is lucky.
Huh. Wait so Joey, if you get this, you're gonna be, like...
...the star of your own TV show.
I mean, you'll be like the "Big Cheese" or the "Big Mac." Hey, you love those!
Well, don't get your hopes up, because probably not gonna happen.
Now-now, why would you say that, Joseph?
Well, I mean, come on, you guys. My own TV show? I just...
I don't know if I'm good enough. I am. Heh.
Joey, What are you talking about? You're a terrific actor.
You really think so? How can you even ask that question?
She's pretty. Yeah. And she's really nice too.
She taught me all about, you know, how to work with cameras...
...and "smell the fart" acting.
I'm sorry, what'd you say? Joey, Excuse me?
It's like, you got so many lines to learn so fast...
...that sometimes you need a minute to remember your next one.
So while you're thinking of it, you take this big pause where you look all intense.
You know, like this:
Oh. Okay.
Here's my scene! Here's my scene!
Mrs. Wallace? I'm Dr. Drake Ramoray, your sister's neurosurgeon.
You sister is suffering from a...
Well, Eva, we've done some excellent work here.
And I would have to say, your problem is quite clear.
I play Al Pacino's butt.
All right? He goes into the shower and then, I'm his butt.
Oh, my God. Come on, you guys.
This is a real movie and Al Pacino's in it, and that's big!
No, it's terrific. You deserve this after all your years of struggling...
...you've finally been able to crack your way into show business.
Okay, fine, make jokes. I don't care. This is a big break for me.
No, you're right, it is. Yeah.
So, you gonna invite us all to the big opening?
All right, I'm out of here. Wish me luck.
Good luck, good luck We all wish you good luck
Yeah, whatever.
It's your turn.
Oh, are we playing this?
Hey. Hey. How did the audition go?
Terrible. I messed up every line. I shouldn't even be an actor.
Wait a minute, are you doing that thing where you pretend it didn't go well...
...but it really did go well?
Yeah, did I fool you? Totally!
So, it did go well? It went amazingly well!
Great. That's great.
Yeah-yeah, It's down to me and two other guys. Oh, my God.
And I know both of them, and they're really good.
One of them is the guy from those allergy commercials who's always being chased...
...by those big flowers. Oh, I love that guy.
Oh. What are you doing?
What am I doing?
I'm so nervous, you know? The callback isn't till tomorrow at 5.
I feel like my head's gonna explode.
Well, it is overdue.
Don't worry, okay? You're gonna be fine.
Yeah, but it's so much pressure.
I mean no offense, but what you guys all do is very different.
I don't know if you'd understand.
Yeah, none of the rest of us have to deal with pressure at our jobs.
Yes, I know what time it is...
...but I'm looking at the WENIS and I'm not happy.
Well, I'm tearing the lettuce.
Uh-huh? Is it dirty? No, don't worry, I'm gonna wash it.
Don't. I like it dirty.
That's your call.
So, uh, what are you going to do next?
Well, I thought that I would cut up the tomatoes.
Are they firm?
They're all right.
You sure they haven't gone bad? You sure they're not very, very bad?
No, really. They're okay.
You gonna slice them up real nice?
Ahem. Actually, I was gonna do them julienne.
I'm out of here.
Monica, I'm quitting. I just helped an 81-year-old woman put on a thong...
...and she didn't even buy it.
I'm telling you I'm quitting. That's it. I'm talking to my boss right now.
Yes, I am. Yes, I am.
Okay, bye. Call me when you get this message.
Well, what happened?
Well, he came in for a massage, and everything was fine until...
Oh, my God.
And all of a sudden, his hands weren't the problem anymore.
Was it? Oh, Boy Scouts could've camped under there.
You ate my sandwich.
It was a simple mistake. It could happen to anyone.
Oh, really?
Now calm down.
Come look in my office. Some of it may still be in the trash.
What? Well, it was quite large.
I had to throw most of it away.
You threw my sandwich away?
My sandwich?
My sandwich!
It's just, I want this part so much, you know?
If I don't get this part, I'm never gonna eat macaroni and cheese again.
No, I didn't say that. That doesn't count.
Come on, guys. It's not like I moved to Europe.
I just moved across the hall.
And we would have you over all the time...
...if it weren't for Monica's allergies.
You're right, I could never lie to you.
She hates you.
Should I get that? Ha-ha-ha.
Hello? Uh, no, Joey's not here right now.
Can I take a message?
Yeah, okay. So the audition's been moved from 5 to 2:30?
Okay, great. Bye.
Aren't you dressed yet? Am I naked again?
We're supposed to meet my parents in 15 minutes.
Okay. I was just talking to the guys. Just look at them.
I mean, is it okay if they come visit?
What about my allergies?
Right. Your allergies.
All her. She hates you.
Yes! All right.
How cool would it be if you could watch like a real life-size version of this?
I mean, how crazy would that be? As crazy as soccer?
Hello?
What are you talking about? The audition's not till 5.
Well, nobody told me.
Who'd you talk to?
Never mind.
You mean you didn't get it from this?
The allergy guy got the part. Thanks.
Well, maybe we can fix it, you know?
Maybe we can send him some big, big flowers and scare him!
How could you do this to me Chandler?!
This part could've turned my whole career around.
I messed up, okay? I'm sorry. I really messed up.
You don't even live here anymore. Why'd you answer my phone?
I have a machine! Which I bought for you.
Taught you how to use it. You thought it was a copier.
If there was anything I could do, I would do it, okay?
But everybody's allowed one mistake, right?
He could have gotten me a VCR. He could have gotten me golf clubs.
But no, he has to get me the woman repeller.
The eyesore from the Liberace House of Crap!
it's not that bad. Oh, yeah, easy for you to say.
You don't have to walk around sporting some reject from the Mr. T Collection.
Chandler. Chandler.
I pity the fool who puts on my jewelry! I do! I do!
I pity the fool that--
Hi.
When you were late last night, Kathy and I got to talking and...
...one thing led to another and...
And what? Did you sleep with her?
No! No, I just kissed her. What? That's even worse!
How is that worse? I don't know! But it's the same!
You're right, I have no excuses. I was totally over the line.
"Over the line?"
You're so far past the line that you can't even see the line!
Yeah, the line is a dot to you!
Look, I'm not saying that you should magically forgive me.
But you're not perfect. You've made some errors in judgment too.
Name one.
What happened?
Aw, man! He promised he wouldn't take the chairs!
What the hell happened? How were you locked in?
And where the hell's all of our stuff?
Well, this guy came by to look at the unit...
...and he said he didn't think big enough to fit a grown man.
So you got in voluntarily?
I was trying to make a sale!
Oh, man, if I ever run into that guy again, you know what I'm gonna do?
Bend over?
There's Lorraine.
Okay, now remember, no trading. You get the pretty one, I get the mess.
Hi, Joey. Hey.
Well, well. Look what you brought.
And what did you bring?
She's checking her coat.
Joey, I'm gonna go wash the cab smell off my hands.
Will you get me a white Zinfandel and a glass of red for Janice?
Janice?
Janice?
Oh, my God!
Joey's tailor took advantage of me.
What?
No way. I've been going to the guy for 12 years.
He said he was gonna do my inseam...
...then he ran his hand up my leg and then there was definite...
What?
Cupping.
That's how they do pants!
Ross, will you tell him?
Isn't that how a tailor measures pants? Yes, yes, it is. In prison!
I said name one!
I can't believe I did this. What an idiot. Stop beating yourself up.
People make mistakes. These things happen.
There aren't any messages you've forgotten to give me, are there?
Apparently, you're not very good at it.
Do you think he'll ever forgive me? Of course he will.
Chandler, the most important thing is that you forgive yourself.
You know what, I kind of have. Already?
That was pretty bad, what you did.
You know what? He will forgive you.
And I like to bring a pad with me when I go answer the phone, just in case. Okay.
You didn't see how mad he was, you know?
I'm sure he will forgive you.
Look, we've all been there, you know? You fight, you make up.
That's the way it works.
It took two people to break up this relationship!
Yeah! You and that girl from the copy place...
...which yesterday you took full responsibility for!
I didn't know what I was taking responsibility for, okay?
I didn't finish the whole letter.
What? I fell asleep.
You fell asleep?
It was 5:30 in the morning.
And you had rambled on for 18 pages.
Front and back!
And by the way? Y-O-U, apostrophe R-E means, "you are."
Y-O-U-R means "your."
Y'know I can't believe I thought of getting back together with you.
We are so over!
Fine by me!
And hey! just so you know, it's not that common...
...it doesn't happen to every guy, and it is a big deal!
I knew it!
You had no right to go out with him. That is the most ridiculous--
You sold me out! I did not sell you out!
Yes, you did! You absolutely sold me-Would you let me talk?
Did you just flick me?
Okay, well, you wouldn't let me finish and I was just-Ow!
Stop it! Ow! Ow!
stop. Stop.
All right. No, let's not do this. No!
Happy thoughts. No!
Stop it! Oh! Oh!
Okay, now I'm gonna kick some ass!
Ow. Ow. Ow. I know, I know.
All right. Now, I will let go if you both stop.
Fine. Fine.
There we go.
Ha. You know what? If we were in prison, you guys would be like my bitches.
Okay, buddy boy, here it is.
You hide my clothes? I'm wearing everything you own.
Oh, my God!
Look at me, I'm Chandler! Could I be wearing any more clothes?
Maybe if I wasn't going "commando."
Yeah. Whew, it's hot with all of this stuff on. I better not do any, I don't know, lunges. 
Joey?
Got you the Joey special. Two pizzas!
Joey?
Hello? Damn it!
Hello?
No, Joey's not here right now, but I can take a message. I think.
He's still got a chance for the part? Oh, That's great news!
Well, no, obviously not for the actor who was mauled by his dog.
Oh well, that's great. I will give Joey the message. Thank you.
Yes!
0Kay.
Mac...
...audition...
...at 2.
Allergy...
...actor...
...attacked.
By dog...
...not...
...flowers.
Hey. Please tell me you got the message.
What message? The actor playing Mac couldn't do it.
They needed to see you at 2:00. What? It's 6:00!
Look! I wrote it! I wrote it on the board!
I wrote it on the board, then went looking all New York City looking for you!
I went to Ross's, I went to the coffee house.
I went to any place that they make sandwiches!
I can't believe this, Chandler! I'm sorry.
I don't know what to say!
Well you-you-you-you might say congratulations!
I saw the board, I went to the audition, I got the part!
Is that supposed to be funny? I was really worried over here.
Oh, well I'm  sorry. Y'know, sometimes that fake out thing is just mean!
Okay, man. I'm sorry. I did not mean to make you feel bad.
Well, that's good.
Because you didn't. And I'm incredibly happy for you!
That's mean!
You had me going there! We could do this all day.
Yeah, you're right.
Okay look, listen, let's talk about what a huge star I'm gonna be.
You are gonna be a huge star. I'm gonna hug you.
You hug me. All right.
Hey, do we do this too much? I think so.
Yeah. Get off me. Yeah.
"Come on, C.H.E.E.S.E., I'm not leaving without you.
Try routing your backup power source through your primary CPU."
"I can't! My circuits are fried! They're fried, I tell you!"
"Well, then I'll just have to carry you."
"That'll be a neat trick...
...when you're dead!"
Ross, you don't have to yell.
There was just an explosion, okay? My hearing would be impaired.
I thought you were excellent.
In fact, for a minute there, I was like, "Ooh, where did Ross go?"
Thank you. And I have to say that first scene where you meet Mae...
Yeah. Oh, my God. I mean...
You know what?
I think that's enough for today. Thanks for your help.
Holding us back. Totally.
Okay, Chandler. Okay.
And your horoscope says:
"On the 5th, a special someone is going to give you a gift."
Oh, well, thank you in advance. Mm. Ha, ha.
"But the 12th brings a lover's spat."
You're going to make a joke about my special present.
Why would you do that?
Oh, wait and "On the 19th, a secret crush announces itself."
Hey, guys. Hey
Oh, my God! It's Joey Tribbiani of Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.
That's right. It's your first day.
So are you psyched to fight fake crime with your robot sidekick?
Am I psyched? The lead in my own TV series?
I've dreamed about this for years.
Why have I not been preparing?
No, Joey, you're gonna be great.
But I gotta act with a robot. Pheebs, I don't know anything about technology.
I can't even use Chandler's computer, except to find porn.
And that's only because it's there when you turn it on.
Our lover's spat will start a little early this month.
I'll be waiting.
Friends  S06E21  The One Where Ross Meets Elizabeth's Dad
Are you judging them by their covers? Because you're really not supposed to do that.
No, I'm just deciding which one to use. I'm going to start writing another book.
Because the last one was such a big seller?
Well, if you must know, I have written 14 books.
And as I'm the only one who has read them...
...I can tell you that they have all been very well received.
Hey. Hey.
Hi. What are you doing later?
Oh, Rachel and I have to get our hair cut.
We do? I want to see what he wants first.
I just found out Elizabeth's dad wants to meet me.
Wait a minute. Hold the phone.
You're not Elizabeth's dad?
Come on, guys. I really want this guy to like me.
It would really help me out if you guys could be here...
...to make me look good. Of course we'll help.
We'll be here. Thanks.
We know how tough those parent-teacher conferences can be.
So here's your office set. Wow, huh?
Mac Machiavelli, Private Investigator. Eh?
Let's get you to wardrobe for a fitting. Okay.
Hey, uh, when do I get to meet the robot?
I'm sorry, why don't we do that right now? He's right here.
Okay. Joey Tribbiani, this is--
Wow! He's so lifelike.
Unbelievable.
This is Wayne, the man who created and operates C.H.E.E.S.E.
How do you do there, buddy?
I'll let you two guys get acquainted, huh? Okay.
Sorry about that.
Uh, so where's C.H.E.E.S.E.? C.H.E.E.S.E. is right here.
Nice to meet you, Mac.
This is the temporary robot, right? No. Why?
Well, I just thought it was gonna be a really cool robot. y'know? 
Like the Terminator, or, uh, when I first saw you.
I spent two years developing this machine. It's absolutely state of the art.
I'm sorry. it just—I don't know it doesn't really look like it can do anything.
It can do this.
Hey-Oh, ha, ha.
This is my father, Paul Stevens. Dad, this is Ross Geller.
It's great to meet you, Paul.
I prefer that Liz's boyfriends to address me as Mr. Stevens.
Uh, Of course, of course. Mr. Stevens.
Good. So, Ross...
...what's your problem?
Excuse me?
Why can't you get a girlfriend your own age?
Heh. It's funny...
Um, it's not funny.
I don't like you going out with my daughter, Ross.
Okay, urn, I can see that.
But I think if you give me, urn, one chance, I can change your mind.
Okay. What?
Okay. I'll give you one chance to change my mind.
You've got one minute.
Daddy. Fine.
Two minutes. Go.
A minute and 50 seconds.
Okay, um--
I want you to know, I have never done anything like this before.
I mean, I've been in, urn, relationships in general.
But I've never done it with a student. I mean, not...
Not "it." We haven't done "it."
Uh-We, I mean-I mean, we've done stuff...
Okay. Okay. A joke. A joke. Lighten the mood.
Um, two guys go into a bar. One of them is Irish.
I'm Irish. And the Irish guy wins the joke.
Ross? Ross!
How crazy that we would run into you. Oh, my God! Thank you.
Um, uh--
Mr. Stevens, I'd like you to meet my friends.
This is Phoebe, Monica, and Chandler.
So you're Elizabeth's father, huh? I can see now where she gets her...
...rugged handsomeness.
Is there a Mrs. Stevens?
There's a Mr. Bing!
No, unfortunately, Lizzie's mom passed away shortly after she was born.
I raised her by myself. Oh...
I get that a lot.
Okay, urn, why don't we all take a seat, you know? Heh.
And, uh, I'll get us all some, uh, coffees.
Yeah, why don't you-Ahem. Uh...
And you guys can talk about whatever you want.
Whatever pops into your head.
It is so strange seeing Ross here, this time of day...
...because usually he's at the children's hospital.
Yeah. But not looking for dates.
So, um, Monica is Ross' sister.
He's a great brother!
I had a sister. Oh.
She passed away. Oh...
You don't have to do that every time.
But, uh, Ross is a great guy. I was roommates with him in college.
Funny story, heh, ha, ha...
Your roommate in college died, didn't he?
A part of him did, yes.
Okay! Here we are, Paul, Elizabeth.
I hope you guys were finding something to talk about.
Yes. We were just-Sorry I'm late.
But I am ready, ready to talk you up. Heh.
When does Liz's father get here? I'm already here.
Oh, Ross is so great.
Honey, you got the kind with the little girl. You said we'd get the kind with the baby.
You said the baby creeps you out. No, The little girl creeps me out.
You said the baby. Why would the baby creep me out?
Why would the little girl creep you out?
I'm sorry. Can you please talk a little slower.
This is going in your book? Yeah, It's about relationships.
You know, the traps, the pitfalls, what not to do.
Keep going. This stuffs great. What?
Excuse me.
And how none of it matters when the people really love each other.
And how people will believe anything you tell them as long as it's a compliment.
Oh, hi! Hi. Hi. Hi.
I left my keys here somewhere. Oh, well, let's look for them.
Under here-Oh, hey!
Hey! Are these them?
No.
All right. Oh.
Here they are. Good.
Thanks for your help. Wait! Sorry!
Mr. Paul? Just call me Paul.
Paul. Um, I just wanted you to know that...
...you know, Ross really is a great guy.
Maybe you could date him then. it would save me the trouble of killing him.
Are you okay?
You just don't look old enough to have a 20-year-old daughter.
Well, we were very young when we had her.
Ah. We? Yeah, it usually takes two people to...
Oh, no! Yes! Of course. I know that.
What I meant was are you still "we" or are you just you?
I'm just me. Yeah.
My wife died shortly after Lizzie was born.
Oh.
So you raised her all on your own? Yes, I did.
Oh...
Hey. Hey.
How was your first day? Great.
Except I got a little attitude from the robot.
Damn those robots. They're supposed to be our faithful servants!
It wasn't the robot, it was the guy who controls him.
He doesn't like me. He had C.H.E.E.S.E. knock over the sandwich table...
...right when I was reaching for one. Ugh.
Why don't you get him fired?
I may have to. I hate to do it. But I'm the star, you know?
There's a limit to how many sandwiches I can eat off the floor.
Excuse me.
Joey Tribbiani.
Joe! I'm glad I found you! I got an audition for you.
Wow. The thing is, it's kind of on the q.t.
The actor who has the part doesn't know he might be fired.
It's the lead in a series.
Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.
I'm the lead in Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.
Uh-oh.
Joey?
Hi, Ross.
I was just getting him to like you.
Joey?
Joey! Hey, Ross.
Ross, Joey is not here.
Okay, I'll just wait for him in here!
Ross, it's okay. You can come out.
Yeah, Ross. It's okay. It's me...
...Mr. Stevens.
Oh, I didn't... Oh, my gosh. I didn't even see you.
Sure you did. You came in, got all awkward and ran to the bedroom.
You were shouting, "Joey, Joey!"
Bye, Rachel. Bye.
I'll call you later. Okay. See you!
Bye, Ross. Ah, hoo. Ha, ha.
What-what-what the—how da-how did-what the-how did-what?!
Well, You know, he lost his keys. So he was looking for them.
In your mouth?
No.
Downstairs. And we got to talking...
...for two hours. I really liked him. I invited him for a cup of coffee.
You were at the coffee house!
Ross, what's the big deal? So I kissed the guy.
He's my girlfriend's father. Okay? It's weird!
You dated my sister. That was different!
What? Why? This is weird for me!
Ross, look. look this is good for you, okay?
Let's face it. So far the guy's not loving you.
But I can turn that around. I've got the inside track.
We could all go out to dinner. y'know? And I could talk you up.
Plus the guy is a very, very successful lawyer.
How is that important? Oh, it's important.
Apparently, there's a million guys out there that can play Mac ...
...and there's only one robot.
And this one guy who controls it. I didn't know he could get me fired.
What am I gonna do? Well, Joey.
You're a pretty charming guy.
Thanks. But I have a problem to deal with.
No, sweetie. You've got to win over the guy who controls C.H.E.E.S.E.
Go back there and kiss some serious robot ass!
That's not a bad idea!
If I have to turn on the charm tomorrow, I'm not wasting any of it on you guys.
Oh, actually I got a little bit saved for you, Pheebs.
So do you think, uh, Joey is more charming than me'?
Yeah. That's why I'm sleeping with him on the side.
Yeah, you wish.
"You wish." Phoebe, stop writing about us.
I'm not writing about you. I'm writing about other people.
Who? Marsha and Chester.
Okay, fine. Fine. Then you know what? I will just write about Phyllis.
Hmm. Huh.
"Phyllis is sitting in the chair." I see what you're doing.
"Phyllis sees what I'm doing." Oh, ho.
Ooh, I have tasted my own medicine and it is bitter.
Morning! Hey!
How's my favorite genius and his robot buddy?
Don't touch him! Okay. All right. Um...
Wayne, level with me. Okay? I keep hearing all these rumors that I might get fired.
Okay, they even have actors coming in to read for my part.
Come on, man. You gotta give me a second chance.
I love this little guy-Aah.
Okay. That's why you didn't want me to touch him, right? There you go.
Stupid! I can't believe this! God.
Hey, how are you doing?
So it seemed that my prom date had stood me up.
So Ross selflessly offered to take me.
What a nice story. Heh.
So Ross was in college...
...and decided to jump at the chance to take a young girl to her prom.
Wow. I definitely did not see that one backfiring.
I'm gonna go to the bathroom. Yeah. Take your time.
Just so you know, I was a freshman and she was a senior. So it wasn't as bad as--
Ross, look. I know I've been giving you a lot of jabs.
It's partly because I'm very protective of Lizzie...
...and partly because well, they just keep coming to me.
But I have to admit that after all the wonderful things Lizzie has told me...
and the many, many, many stories that Rachel has told me...
that, well
you're not
all bad.
"Not all bad."
And anyhow, I'm sorry I was so harsh before, But you have to understand.
I still look at Lizzie like she's a 12-year-old girl.
You know, I know what you mean. I do that, too.
I beg your pardon? No! No! Not—I don't mean I-I see her as a 12-year-old girl.
I mean, I have a son who's, um, 6, and I still think of him as a baby.
You have a son? Yeah. My ex-wife and I...
...uh, share custody of Ben. And, uh--
Just so you know, Carol and I are on excellent terms...
...as I'm sure you are with your wife.
Oh! I'm sorry.
It's unbelievable!
Don't worry about it, I just didn't realize you were married.
Oh, we were. But that was just a...
I mean, that was just a big drunken mistake.
You're back.
You two were married?
Oh, whoops. I'm sorry. You were talking about Emily.
Chandler, we said we would meet at the coffee house at 6:00.
We said 7:00. We said 6:00!
The only way that I said 6:00...
...would be if I said the sentence, "Let's meet at 7:00, not at 6:00."
If I had said 7:00, maybe I would have said something like:
"Wow, my boyfriend is such a wiseass. 7:00!"
Hi! Oh my God!
I know what time you said. What?
Well, actually I know what time Chester and Marsha said.
What time? Quite an interesting turn of events.
Suddenly it's my book to the rescue, huh? Let's see.
Ooh. Very interesting.
Yeah, well this certainly clears things up.
What does it say? I will tell you...
...as soon as you thank me for writing my book.
Thank you for writing your book. It's a great book...
...and you are the queen of everything.
Thanks. So are you.
I told you I should not wear this color.
"Monica-Marsha and Chester are planning on seeing a movie Sunday night.
"Marsha thinks they're supposed to meet at 6:00.
Chester thinks it's at 7:00."
So you knew we would miss the movie? That's right.
Instead of telling us, you decided to write it in your stupid book?
"Marsha and Chester are mad at Phyllis."
I can't believe I'm gonna lose this job.
I'm so sorry, man. ls there anything I can do?
Yeah. Help me get this mini-fridge past the security guard.
Hey, Joey, I want to talk to you.
Yeah? I don't want to talk to you, Wayne. I hate you. You ruined my life.
Oh, Chandler, Wayne. Wayne, Chandler. Hi. How are you?
Joey, I'll get you your job back if you help me out.
Why should I help you out?
The reason he just said. What do you need?
I saw you on stage talking to that beautiful woman.
You know, Sarah. I wish I could talk to her.
Are you in love with her? Yeah.
Her. All of them. Anyone.
Yeah. I've been there, my friend.
Listen, I guarantee you keep your job...
...if you can teach me how to talk to women like you do.
Oh, Wayne, it's not something you can teach y'know? It's pretty much something you're born with--
You can teach it. I can show you right now.
I mean, if you think about it...
...I mean Ross did learn something from each marriage.
How to make the next one even shorter? Oh.
Now wait a minute. That's not fair.
He was married to me a hell of a lot longer than he was to Emily.
He just didn't tell me.
Maybe I have to pee again.
Well, this is fun.
So Ross...
...did you kill any of these wives?
You know what? I--
I have had enough of this. Y'know, I care a great deal about your daughter.
And I have treated her with nothing but respect.
So if you've got a problem with me. frankly... Are you yelling at me'?
God, no.
You know what, Daddy? If you don't like Ross, that's fine.
It doesn't matter to me. I'm gonna go outwith him anyway.
Really?
Well, if it doesn't matter to her...
...it doesn't matter to me. Still not yelling.
Well, what can I say?
This doesn't make me like you better.
That's okay. I'm not so crazy about myself right now either.
Then we agree? Yeah, I guess so.
Neither of us like Ross. I like Ross.
Oh, heh, kids!
Wait. I just thought of another story about how nice Ross is.
That's okay, Rach. We're not liking Ross right now.
Oh! Well, I got a lot of those, too. Uh
Well, it turns out you were right, C.H.E.E.S.E.
That shipment never made it to Omaha? You got it.
And the rabbi's beard? 100 percent horse hair.
Nice catch, C.H.E.E.S.E.
It's your line, C.H.E.E.S.E.
Wayne! Wayne!
Hi, you guys. Hey.
What's the matter?
Well, it's just... It's one of these situations that I just hate.
You know, a massage client gave me three tickets...
...to the Helmut Peltz Exhibit at the Morgan Chase Museum.
Now you're thinking you gotta sleep with him.
No. No, it's just that he gave me three tickets and there are six of us.
I'll give up my ticket. Me too.
Okay. That's so generous.
And I think Ross is generous too.
Great. Okay. Then it's just us girls.
Great. Yeah.
So, what is the exhibit?
It's mostly just photographs...
...of, um, lesbian love scenes interspersed with video games and free sandwiches.
Oh, man.
Hi. Hi. Hi there.
Hey, Ross, listen.
Chandler got you out of going to the lesbian sandwich museum this weekend.
Thanks? But I have plans. Uh, Elizabeth and I are going out of town.
Oh, that's great. Yeah.
Think about all the money that you're gonna make.
Why? What?
Well, her father pays you for babysitting, right?
Uh-oh. Ha, ha.
No, no. That's funny. But maybe it's time to move on.
You know, let it go. Stop it.
Besides, Rachel's going out with Elizabeth's father.
So, uh, he's much older than she is.
Looks like I'm not the only one interested in fossils. Huh?
I means, all that does is remind us that you are interested in fossils.
Okay, okay.
Uh, well, Rachel's gonna to need to yell sweet nothings in his ear. Huh?
Ross? Oh, come on, that's funny, you know?
he's need— he's got, like, a hearing aide, you know?
‘cause-‘cause y'know, ‘cause he's all old.
One second.
Okay, look, Ross.
Just so you know, since Lizzie likes you so much...
...I accept the fact that you're going out with her.
Really? Okay, that's great.
Yeah. But then I changed my mind.
I'm funny like that.
So I've told Lizzie and now I'm telling you.
I don't want you seeing my daughter anymore.
All right, look. I realize it upsets you.
Yes, it does.
But Elizabeth and I are both adults...
...and so I don't think there's really anything you can do about it.
I'll tell the university about your relationship and have you fired.
Oh, a man with a plan.
Friends  S06E22  The One Where Paul's The Man
This is so exciting. You get your picture back up on the wall of fame.
I know. It was so cool when it was up there before.
Me and Jim Belushi would just be cracking up about something.
Then I get fired off Days of Our Lives and he takes me down.
Now he's just laughing at me.
Look at him. That smug Belushi bastard.
Oh. Okay. Maybe when they put your picture back up...
...they could put you next to Matt Lauer.
Look at him just smiling at me. Hee-hee.
Yeah, I know. We'd be great together.
Hey. So I'm back. Who are you?
Joey Tribbiani.
From the wall?
Okay, maybe this will jog your memory, huh?
Huh?
Okay, anyway.
I'm ready to go back up on the wall. I'm the star of a new TV show.
Show me in the TV book. Oh, well, it's not on TV yet.
Well, then it's not on the wall yet.
Okay, fine. I will bring you a tape. Huh?
So, um, now, do you have any of Matt Lauer's clothes here?
Maybe just ones that haven't been cleaned yet?
God.
Oh, I love museums.
Soaking up all the culture. Yeah.
Where do you want to start? Ooh, the gift shop.
Yeah.
Hey, and then lunch. Oh, wait, yes, but I can't eat too much.
Paul's taking me out to dinner tonight. He said he has a big surprise planned.
Ow, wow. What do you think? Maybe he's gonna tell you he's gay?
What? No, why?
No reason. That would just be a really big surprise, right?
You could put the aisle over here and then have the wedding ceremony here.
I didn't know you could get married here.
This would be a beautiful place to get married.
Yeah, but I wouldn't put the aisle there. And I'd never have the ceremony there.
You'd have the ceremony under this big, beautiful arch.
May I help you?
Oh, sorry. Didn't mean to interrupt. It's just such a beautiful space.
Do you do a lot of weddings here? Yes, we're very popular.
There's a two-year waiting list. Sorry.
Monica, you should totally put your name down for this place.
What? Are you crazy?
I'm not getting married. I'm not even engaged.
Yeah, but there's a two-year wait. What if you get engaged in two years?
Then you've gotta wait another two years for this place?
That's four years. Chandler's not gonna wait that long.
He's gonna find somebody else, you know?
Someone, someone who did put their name on the list. Mm-hm.
Yeah. Honey, it can't hurt to put your name down.
If in two years you're not engaged, you just don't use it.
Well, I guess there is no harm in putting my name down.
I'm gonna do it too. Me too.
Really? Who would you marry?
I don't know. I don't have anyone right now, you know?
Oh, Pheebs.
Don't feel too sorry for me. At least my boyfriend isn't gay.
Phoebe, that's not... Don't even get me started on yours.
Hey.
So, did you watch the tape of my show? I did.
All right. Let's get me back up there. No. You don't go up on the wall.
What? But you saw the show. Yes. It was very offensive to my people.
Dry cleaners?
Russians. It showed them as terrorists and villains.
Okay, okay. Look, you got Harrison Ford up there.
That's right. Mr. Ford is a very good customer.
He brings us a lot of clothes. You bring us nothing.
Okay, well, that may be true.
But, in-in .Air Force One. okay, the Russians  were terrorists and evil.
And plus, he kills a bunch of them. That's offensive to Russians.
I've never seen it. Oh, you should. It's great.
This place is really beautiful.
Yeah. I've been coming here since I was a kid. This used to be my grandma's.
Wow. The only thing I got from my grandmother was her eyes. Heh.
I mean, not her actual eyeballs.
But people say that my eyes look...
Do you want to make out? Sure. Ha, ha.
Are you okay?
What's wrong? Uh...
Yeah, I was just thinking about your father.
Well, whatever works for you. No.
No, no. Uh, he just really freaked me out before.
Oh.
Well, so we have to hide our relationship from one more person.
Big deal. Besides, we've had fun hiding it.
Yeah.
Hey. Yeah.
Um, you brought protection, right?
Why? Are there, like, bears or something?
No. Oh, uh...
Oh, protection, yeah. No. That I forgot.
Ha, ha. I'll just run to the store and get some.
No. Hey, hey. I'm the guy. I'll get it.
Do you know where the store is? No.
Do you want to ride around town on my little pink bicycle?
A little bit.
I'll be back in 10 minutes. Okay.
Why don't you get in the hot tub and I'll meet you there.
Oh, okay.
Oh, my God. What a great surprise. This is such a beautiful house.
Thank you. It used to be my mother's. So this is the kitchen.
You've reached Monica and Chandler's.
If you're listening to this message, we're probably screening.
Yeah, we are.
Hi, this is Hildy from the Morgan Chase Museum.
I'm calling for Monica Geller.
I want to let her know there was a cancellation.
If she's still interested in having the Bing-Geller wedding at our facility...
...it is available.
This is Chandler Bing. This is Chandler Bing.
Yes, the groom. No, not the groom!
It's so secluded up here.
I know. That's why I like it here. Mm-hm.
I feel like we're the only two people in the world.
Whoops. Sorry.
What's the matter, honey?
Did you see a little mouse? No. Big bear. Big bear outside.
I think I...
Actually, would you go check on that?
Honey, we don't have any bears here.
Well, okay.
Well, okay. Would-would you get me a Diet Coke?
Okay. I'll be right back. Okay.
What are you doing here? What are you doing here?
I came with Paul. Yeah. I recognized the ankles.
Hurry up. Get out.
Here you go, honey.
Ah. Thank you. Diet Coke.
Oh. Ice.
I need ice.
Okay.
Thank you. Be right back.
Okay.
You and your ice. Oh.
Get out. Get out. Go. Come on.
Quick.
No, not in there! Not in there! He's in there!
Did you really hear a bear? Go!
Here you go, honey.
One Diet Coke with ice.
Oh, thank you.
I am so happy that you're here.
Here I am. Elizabeth.
Oh, look. Elizabeth's here.
Who were you talking to?
You guys?
How did you know we were here?
Um... Well, she obviously saw the tire tracks...
...that were leading up to the closed garage.
Obviously. Heh.
Elizabeth, what are you doing here?
Did you come up here to work on that term paper or something?
Yeah. Yeah.
Well, why don't you, you know, go in that room and do your homework?
Oh, I wouldn't do it in there. Um, that's my dad's bedroom.
That's your dad's bedroom.
Ha, ha. That's your dad's bedroom.
Why are you yelling? Oh!
That Diet Coke, I think, went straight to my head. Whoo!
Hi, honey.
See you later.
Wait. I bought groceries. I was gonna make you dinner.
Well, next time, ask.
Or at least wait for me to ask.
Hi, this is Hildy from the Morgan Chase Museum.
I'm calling for Monica Geller.
Oh, no.
I wanna let her know there's been a cancellation.
If she's still interested in having the Bing-Geller wedding at our facility...
...it is available.
Please. He didn't hear it. He didn't hear it.
This is Chandler Bing. This is Chandler Bing.
No!
Can I help you?
Uh, yeah. Where's the guy who decides whose pictures go up on the wall?
He's not here right now. Oh, you're kidding me.
All right, well, make sure you tell him that Joey Tribbiani stopped by to drop off these clothes.
Okay? I'm an actor. I'm trying to get my picture up there on the wall.
You know, there are two people who could get your picture up there.
Oh, really?
Well, maybe you and I go out for drinks.
You're the other one, right?
So, Lizzie, are-are-are you planning on staying the night?
Oh, no, no. Believe me, I'm leaving as soon as possible.
Good, good. Not that we don't want you to stay. Obviously, you're welcome.
How much more homework do you have?
Uh, I just have one problem left that I do not know how to solve.
Uh, Rachel, maybe you want to come upstairs and help me figure it out?
Really?
Okay.
Okay, I'll go upstairs...
...if you get me something from the car.
What do you need from the car?
Surprise me.
Okay. Okay.
So you're gonna be in the car. I will be upstairs.
And that's where everybody's gonna be.
Just relax. Just relax, Paul. You're doing great.
She likes you. She...
I think she likes you. She likes you.
You know why? Because you're a neat guy.
You are the man. You are the man.
Still got it.
Still sexy.
You're just a love machine.
I'm just a love machine
So proud of what you have, baby
Showtime.
I'm just a love machine Hey, baby
Phoebe? Yeah?
Have you seen Chandler? No, why?
The woman from the museum called and said that there was a cancellation...
...and we could move up our wedding. and Chandler heard.
I know. How bad is this?
Well, with a regular guy, it's bad. With Chandler, oh, dear God.
I know. I know. He totally freaked out and I can't find him anywhere.
Well, what are you gonna do? I'm never listening to you again, that's for sure!
"Y'know, harm can it do to put your name down?"
Rachel said that. Well, Rachel's not here!
Ooh, here it is.
Ooh, Joey, why did you sign it, "son of a bitch"?
I didn't do that. Who would've done that? Son of a bitch.
Okay. Maybe ask this guy.
You. Get out of my shop.
What did he do? He went out with my wife.
Joey. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey, I did not go out with your wife. Okay?
I went out with her. That's my wife.
Get out!
Well, we should go. Yeah.
Ross? Ross?
Elizabeth.
Okay. Okay. I'm gonna go out this window.
I'll meet you at the front door.
Just tell them you're going home, okay? Okay.
Wait, wait. No, don't go in there.
Don't go in there. I need another soda.
Ross.
Oh, my God. Ross, what in heaven's name are you doing here?
And that is why we cannot see each other anymore.
Ross, you and I are gonna have to have a little talk.
Daddy, I... You're next.
Okay. I didn't know he was here.
Let me just see if I got this straight.
I tell you to stay away from my daughter or I'll have you fired.
What you heard was: "Take my daughter...
...come up to my country house and ruin my weekend with Rachel."
Okay. Please, Paul. Just let me explain. No. Let me explain. Fired.
Okay, fine. Fine. Have me fired.
But, uh, I want you to know...
...that you and I are not all that different. I mean...
...l, too, am a neat guy.
What?
And I, too...
...am just a love machine.
Ross.
Let me show you where the guest room is.
I'm so sorry. Please stop freaking out.
I'm not freaking out.
Why would I freak out?
A woman named Hildy called and said we were getting married.
But that happens every day. Ah-ah-ah!
Honey, we were at this beautiful place.
And I just put our names down for fun.
I mean, what's the harm in that? Right here.
Chandler, please don't think I was trying to pressure you.
Phoebe and Rachel just thought... Phoebe and Rachel?
So the people that knew about our wedding before me were you...
...Phoebe and Rachel, Hildy...
...and apparently some band called Star Light Magic Seven...
...who are available, by the way.
It was a mistake.
Please don't take this to mean anything, because it doesn't.
Okay.
Really?
Yes. If it really doesn't mean anything, because you know I'm just not ready.
I know. I know.
Okay.
All right.
Now, I'm gonna go tell Joey that you're back.
We were really worried about you.
Hey, did she buy it? Totally.
So did Hildy show you the place? Yeah. It's beautiful.
I can't believe you're gonna ask Monica to marry you.
I know.
Hey, Gunther. Take these cappuccinos to Table 11.
And that guy over there wants some biscotti.
Oh. Well, I just actually came in for a cup of coffee to go.
Do you still work here?
No, no. I quit a long time ago.
Did I forget to tell you that? I'm sorry.
Oh, that's cool, I was gonna fire you anyway. Great.
Pheebs, can you help me pick an engagement ring for Monica?
I can't figure this out. It's so hard.
Should I get her a Tiffany cut, or a princess cut or a--
Ow! Paper out!
Now, have you told anyone else?
No, I don't want to tell anybody else because I don't want Monica to find out.
You told me.
Well, that's because I trust you, and we're best friends...
...and you walked in on me while I was looking at ring brochures.
Yeah well, once again, not knocking pays off.
I only wish you hadn't been on the toilet. Me too.
Hey. Hey.
So Chandler, wanna go to the coffeehouse? Oh, all right.
Oh, perfect. We were just gonna see if you wanted to go.
Oh, well, we don't, because we got the other place.
How rude.
Oh, I'm sorry. You want a bite?
Friends  S06E23  The One With The Ring
So how are things going with Paul?
Good. Huh.
Although, you know, he's a private guy. Mm-hm.
You know, I wish I could get him to open up a bit. Share some feelings.
That's easy. You just have to think of him as a jar of pickles that won't open.
So, what are you saying?
I should run him under hot water and bang his head against a table?
No, that's what you do when you want to get the truth out of someone.
Hi. Hi.
How are you? Watch this.
Hey, Paul. Hi, Phoebe.
So how are things going with you?
Can't complain.
Hey! Hi.
Great to-Ross, good to see you too.
Good. Bye. You take care.
Hey, Pheebs, what was the deal with you and Chandler blowing us off before?
Ah, that was so weird, huh?
Phoebe, why did you do it?
I didn't do it. It was Chandler.
He's-He's mad at you.
What? Why? Oh, please. I think you know why.
I can't think of anything.
Come on, Ross. You're a paleontologist. Dig a little deeper.
Wait a minute, is it because Joey and I didn't invite him to that Knicks game...
...a couple weeks ago?
Do you think that's something that he'd be mad at you for?
I guess it could. Well, then I think that's it.
Well, if he's angry, he really shouldn't just cover it up.
I wish he'd just tell me the truth.
Oh, if that's what you want...
...then you really should run him under hot water and bang his head against the table.
Honey, I made a reservation at China Garden. Is that okay?
Yeah, that's great.
But first, wait, talk to me, talk to me. Tell me about your day.
It was fine.
0Kay.
Hey, what are you thinking? What are you thinking right now?
I'm thinking that you are looking really fine in that dress.
Yeah, that's great, Paul. But, you know...
I want to know what-Wow, those are really great.
I just want to know...
...what is behind this strong, silent exterior?
You know, they say that still waters run deep...
...and I want to swim in yours.
Are you talking about having sex?
No, PauL
I don't know anything about you.
You know, like your childhood. Tell me about your childhood.
Normal.
Okay, well, then how about puberty? Come on. That's always a painful time.
You know, your friends invite you to a slumber party...
...and stick your hand in warm water...
...while you're sleeping so that you pee in your sleeping bag.
No, that never happened to me.
Well, you're lucky you never met that bitch, Sharon Majeski.
Anyway...
The rest of your life, you know. Any regrets?
No.
All right, Paul. I'm not asking for a lot here.
Okay? Just give me something. Anything.
okay. okay
When I was 6 years old... Mm-hm.
...I wanted a Big Wheel.
And instead, my parents got me this little...
...plastic chicken that you hop around on.
It was embarrassing. Kids made fun of me.
That was a pretty tough year.
That's great. See? Heh.
I already feel like I know you a little better. Thank you.
Okay, come on. Now we can go eat. Let's go.
It was horrible.
They called me "Chicken Boy."
In fifth grade, I got in a fight. Well, it wasn't really a fight.
Richard Danville bit me on the nose.
I fell down, still have a little scar right here. You can see it.
Yeah, yeah. I see the scar.
Listen, Paul, I think this is really great that, you know, you've shared your feelings.
It's really... It's beautiful.
But, urn, what do you say we go share some food?
No, I couldn't eat now.
What are you talking about? You love their Kung Pao chicken.
Chicken?
Chicken Boy! I'm sorry. I didn't mean to do that.
Well, this is the nine millionth ring store we've been to...
...and I can't find the perfect ring.
Ugly ring, ugly ring, ugly ring...
It's a beautiful selection.
Okay, so maybe you don't get her a ring.
Maybe you do something different, you know?
Maybe you get her an engagement bracelet. Or an engagement tiara.
Ooh! An engagement Revolutionary War musket.
You know, I'm so glad I picked you to help me with this.
Can't you imagine getting down on one knee...
...and handing her this gorgeous piece of weaponry?
Yeah, I'm gonna stick with the ring.
Oh, this one's nice. I like it this one.
Sir? Kind sir, can I see this one?
Wait a minute. This is the reason you brought me, okay?
I know how to haggle. So let me handle this from here on out.
Can I help you?
Yes, I would like to see that ring, please. Or not. Whatever.
This ring is from the 1920s.
It's a one-and-a-half karat diamond with sapphires on either side.
Sir, could I ask you to, um...?
Could you hold out that ring and ask me to marry you?
Okay. Okay.
Will you marry me?
Oh, my God, that's it. That's the ring.
How much is it? Chandler, I will handle this.
How much is it?
Eight thousand six hundred.
We will give you $10.
Are you interested in this ring? Yes. Yes.
But I can only pay $8000.
Okay. I can let it go for 8. We stand firm at $10.
How would you like to pay? Uh, credit card.
Oh, no. No, no, but I lent my credit card to Joey.
Okay, I'll go get it. You guard the ring. Okay.
Listen, I'm sorry about before.
Do you have anything here for $10?
Uh, yes. I have these two rather beautiful...
...five-dollar bills.
I'll give you $1 for them.
Hey, remember how Chandler and Phoebe blew us off yesterday?
No.
Remember, you were eating pizza? Yeah.
Well, apparently Chandler's angry at us...
...for not getting him a ticket to that Knicks game a couple weeks ago.
What, we were supposed to just get him a ticket?
That guy is always mooching off of us. Yeah.
Anyway, I still think we should try to patch things up, you know?
Like, maybe we could get him tickets to another Knicks game and invite him.
Wow, that's a great idea. And I still have his credit card.
Here you go.
Hey, hey. I got this one. Here you go.
You know, I gotta tell you, sometimes I just don't get Chandler.
You know, me and him do stuff all the time without you...
...and you don't get all upset.
All the time? All the time.
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Still crying? Like a little girl.
I know, I know, I know. This is all my fault.
I wanted him to open up.
But God, I didn't know that I was gonna unleash...
...this weepy, clingy, moist monster.
You know, I only know of two sure-fire ways to shut a man up.
And one of them is sex.
What's the other? I Don't know.
I never had to use the other one.
I'm just saying, you know, if we're having sex, he's not talking.
Ah, that's right. You're the talker.
Anyway, uh, great idea. Yeah.
Um, I gotta go to the store. I told him that I would buy him some more tissues.
Uh, we have some here. No, you don't.
Okay. Um, I'd also like to try on the tiara.
Oh, yeah. Okay.
Wow, what do you think? Too much?
A tad.
Then take the tiara back...
...and let me hold the musket again.
Something's missing.
Let me see the ring that my friend picked out.
Where's the 1920s princess-cut ring?
I just sold it to that gentleman.
Oh, my God!
Wait, no!
Let me out! Now!
Rachel?
No.
How are you, Paul? Okay.
Chandler...
...did your dad ever hug you? No. Did he hug you?
No. No.
It's just that my dad never did.
I miss my dad.
Well, you can see my dad in Vegas kissing other dads.
Hey, Chandler? Yeah?
Would you...?
Would you hug me?
I'm a little busy here, Paul. That's exactly what my dad used to say.
Okay. A quick one. Come on, hug it out.
Hey. Hey.
There you go.
0Kay.
Five more seconds-Okay.
Joey! What? Hey, what--?
Hi. Paul, is it?
Do you have my credit card? Yeah. It's in my...
In my pocket.
My back pocket. Back pocket. Thank God.
Listen, I got tickets to the Knicks tonight. I can't go.
Come on, it'll be fun.
Me, you, Ross and... Paul, probably.
Chandler, I found the perfect ring.
Oh, that's pretty nice, but I'm gonna go with the one I picked first.
Oh, wake up, Chandler. The one you picked is gone. It's over.
What?
Some guy bought it. I'm sorry. I tried to stop him but they put me in jail.
They put you in jail? The little jail between the doors!
Phoebe, I asked you to guard the ring. I know. I'm sorry.
But, you know, this ring is better. And Monica never even saw the other ring.
Yeah. But when he proposed to me with the ring, I got goose bumps.
Maybe it was the guy. It was the ring.
Hey, so was he excited about the tickets? No. He blew us off.
What? I know.
I can't believe it.
Can I tell you something?
I'm a little mad at him now.
Can I tell you something?
Me too.
You know what? He didn't want to talk to us about being angry?
Well, maybe we don't talk to him at all.
Freeze him out. That's right.
I like it. Ah? We'll show him.
From now on, it's gonna be Joey and Ross, best friends.
Okay, we're gonna be the new Joey and Chandler. Ha, ha.
Hi, I'm back.
Hey! I have so much more to tell you. I've written it all down.
Oh, that's great.
No, actually, that's...
That's great. That's really great.
You know, I gotta tell you, writing, all that writing, it gets me, uh...
It gets me kind of hot.
Wait, wait. Listen to this:
Know what I wanted to be when I was that age?
A lover?
A surfer. Oh, yeah. A surfer?
I wanted to be one with the waves-Honey, hold on real quick.
Hold on a second. Let me just get a little more comfortable here.
Wait, now wait a second,
This isn't too revealing, is it? No.
Whatever happened to that little dude?
So full of dreams.
I don't care about the little dude.
I can't. I cannot listen to any more of this.
Y'know, the only person who'd listen to this is a mental health professional.
And that's only because they get paid $100 an hour.
Do you know how much money I could've made listening to you?
Two thousand dollars.
And you know when I figured that out? While you were talking.
I can't believe you're trying to stifle me, when just 14 hours ago...
...we figured out that that's exactly what my mother was trying to do to me.
I'm sorry.
I don't mean... I didn't mean to stifle you.
This is all just a little overwhelming.
Oh, Rachel.
I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean to overwhelm you.
It's just that when those gates open...
...it's hard to close them.
But they are closed now. Believe me.
I'm so glad. I'm so glad you shared.
And I'm glad that you're done.
So, what do you say we, um...
I'd really like that. Mm-hm.
That was so good.
Hey. I can't believe you talked me into...
...buying this stupid gumball-machine-looking ring.
It's not a stupid gumball-machine-looking ring. It's a beautiful ring.
No, it's not.
When I looked at the other ring...
...I could see Monica's face when I gave it to her...
...and I could see her saying yes.
When I look at this ring, all I see is a ring.
Unless I look at it really closely, and then I can see my own eye.
Look, this is the most important thing I'm gonna do in my life.
I want to make sure it's perfect.
Okay. There may be a way that we could get the other ring back.
Because I heard the guy tell the jeweler where he was gonna propose.
So maybe we could get him to trade rings or something.
I can't do that.
Well, you certainly can't give her that stupid gumball ring.
There he is.
Okay, and he hasn't proposed yet. She has no ring on her finger.
Wow, you're good. After this, we should solve crimes.
Yeah. Okay. Go get him.
Oh, okay.
Excuse me, sir. Could you come with me, please? You have a phone call.
Who is it? It is your office.
Do you know who at my office? John.
Oh, John. Great.
There he is. Hi. Hi. Okay.
Okay, there was a mix-up at the jewelry store.
The ring you're about to propose with was supposed to be held for me.
So I'm gonna need to have that back.
But in exchange, I'm willing to trade you this beautiful, more expensive ring.
Wow, I would trade.
It is beautiful, but I'm gonna use this one. Now, if you'll excuse me.
No, no. See, this is my fiancée, and her heart was set on that ring.
You don't want to break her heart now, do you?
Yeah. Do you want to break a dying woman's heart?
You're dying?
Yeah, she's dying...
...of a cough, apparently.
It's my dying wish to have that ring. See, if I'm not buried with that ring...
...then my spirit will wander the netherworld--
Okay, that's enough, honey.
Oh, I don't know.
Let me see the ring. Great. Okay, here.
All right, I'll do it. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
And you are about to marry a wonderful man.
Hey, I'm marrying a dead woman.
Guys?
I got something important to tell you.
Guys.
Guys?
Guys?
I'm gonna ask Monica to marry me.
I think we gotta end the freeze-out.
Wait a minute. Is this for real?
Yeah. Check out the ring.
Oh, my God.
So you two are really serious?
Yeah, pretty much.
You're gonna get married? I mean...
We're gonna be brothers-in-law. Come here!
And we're gonna be friends again. Hey.
What?
Water under the bridge. Forget it! Okay.
I was gonna wait till it was official, you know, but I got so excited I just had to tell you guys...
...because you're my best friends.
I think I'm gonna cry. Oh. No more crying.
Please, I just dumped one cry baby. I'll dump you too.
I'm gonna ask Monica to marry me.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Oh, Chandler. You guys are gonna be so happy.
I know. Where's all the tissues?
Check out the ring.
Oh, nice. One-and-a-half karat, easy.
Hey. Hey, Pheebs.
Chandler's gonna ask Monica to marry him.
I know. I helped pick out the ring.
You told her before you told us?
Well, she walked in while I was looking at ring brochures.
You can understand that, right?
Guys?
Guys?
That is the most beautiful engagement ring ever!
Yeah? Well, you should know, you bought like a billion of them.
Yeah, you didn't get one.
Okay, well tonight's the big night. Okay listen, how are you gonna ask her?
It is going to be perfect. I am taking her to her favorite restaurant.
I'm going to get her a bottle of the champagne she really loves, therefore knows how expensive it is.
Then, when the glasses are full, instead of proposing a toast, I'm just gonna propose.
Aw. Sounds perfect!
You're gonna mess it up let me do it.
I'm not gonna mess it up.
If she says no, can I have the ring?
She's not gonna say no. If?
Hey. Hey.
Hey, Monica.
Give me it! It's gone.
Phoebe.
Hey. Hey, Monica!
We're practically kissing.
Friends  S06E24  The One With The Proposal

Wait a minute. Does everyone feel this way?
Yeah. Yeah, sort of. I'm sorry.
Uh, wow. Uh, I thought you guys were just like making jokes, I had no idea.
What you know what? You guys are wrong. Yes, there is a chronological age difference.
But I never notice it, You know why? because she is very mature.

Joey, it is an auction. You don't guess. You buy!
What?
I don't have $20,000.
Congratulations on your new boat, Joey Tribbiani.
Joey, sit down.

Yeah. I'm okay.
I'm a little cold. Can I have yourjacket?

Because then I would be cold.
If you thought you'd be cold, you should have brought a jacket.
Uh, other than that, are you okay?
Are you sure you're okay?
Yes. I'm fine.
In fact, I've been fine for a long time now and I think...
...the reason is you.
That's sweet.
Okay. Um.
Before I met you, I had really little life.
And I couldn't imagine growing old--
Oh, my God.
I know. But let me say it. Oh, my God. Richard.
What? I'm Chandler.
Oh, that's Richard.
Oh God, Maybe he won't see us. Richard!
Monica. Chandler. Hey.
I don't know why I did that.
It's good to see you. You too. You let your hair grow.
Yeah. Oh, that's right, you always wanted me to.
I see your mustache is back.
Well, my nose got lonely.
And you don't have a mustache, which is good. Ha, ha.
I'm Chandler. I make jokes when I'm uncomfortable.
I'm sorry. Lisa, Monica, Chandler. We used to date.
Richard! No one's supposed to know about us!
See, I did it again.
Chandler, wh-why don't we sit down? Yeah, I'll sit down.
Good to see you.
Your table is ready, sir.
Oh. Good to see you guys. Yes.
If you prefer, this table's available.
That might be fun.
What were you thinking?
I didn't know it was an auction.
I figured I'd take a guess.
Help a charity. Free boat!
Why would a charity give away a free boat?
I don't know. Charity? Oh!
Well, just buy the damn boat.
Phoebe, don't you think you've had enough to drink?
I'm just helping the kids.
How is you drinking helping the kids?
Because the more I drink, the less there is for the kids to drink.
Mr. Tribbiani. Your contribution brings us...
...a big step closer to building the youth center.
Just out of curiosity, how much is that boat worth?
I think it was valued at 19,000.
Hey, I was pretty close.
Uh, so, bad news.
Um, I can't buy the boat. I don't have any money.
Joey! Joey, good one!
Good! Very good!
So uh listen, I think I'm gonna take off now. Hey! You can't leave, Joey!
You agreed to buy that boat. all right! It is a contract.
Plus, if you leave, my boss is gonna kill me.
Well, what am I gonna do, Rach? I don't have that kind of money.
I know. Okay, okay, okay, okay.
This is what we'll do.
We'll go to the next highest bidder, and we'll let them buy it.
Then you're just gonna pay the difference.
0Kay.
Look, I don't know why the kids need a youth center anyway.Y'know?
They should just watch TV after school like I did. And I turned out fine.
Not great.
And so, we're hiding in the bathroom...
And-and then I sneak out. But before Monica can, her parents come in.
So I hide in the shower, next thing you know...
...they're going at it right on the bathroom floor.
Oh, my God!
I got a good one. I got a good one.
I once walked in on both my parents making love to the same guy.
It's so great seeing you guys again. I'd like to make a toast.
Uh, as a poet once said, "In the sweetness of friendship...
...let there be laughter and sharing of pleasures for...
...in the dew of little things...
...the heart finds its morning and is refreshed."
Aw.
What?
Oh, my God! You guys!
Before you say anything, have we got a story for you. Guess who we bumped into at dinner!
Who? Richard!
Oh. Oh.
I thought you were going out with Elizabeth.
Yeah, I was but uh, she was a little busy with a water balloon fight.
Oh Ross, sometimes grownups have commitments they just can't get out of.
Maybe she is too young for me.
When I was over there and she was running around with her friends, I felt like I was a babysitter.
I finally see what you were talking about. I don't know what to do.
Why don't you just weigh the good stuff about the relationship against the bad stuff.
That's what I did when I first started weighing stuff.
Okay, urn, bad stuff. Well, I'm- I'm 12 years older than she is.
If the school finds out you're fired.
She's leaving for three months. For camp.
Okay, good stuff. Um...
Well, she's sweet and pretty and...
Look Ross, the only question you need to ask is, do you see a future?
Do you see yourself marrying her?
My God. You did it already. You married her, didn't you?
No! No! I didn't do that. It's just...
Okay, Honestly, no, I don't, I don't see a big future with her.
Okay, I think that's your answer.
I gotta talk to her. I hate this part.
Forget Elizabeth. I mean if you're not careful...
...you may not get married at all this year.
Rash , Rash.
Next highest bidder is at table one. Great.
Oh and uh the guy who got the Paris trip is at table four. Oh, okay.
Why do you care about the guy who won the Paris trip?
It's a trip for two.
Excuse me.
Excuse me. ls the person who won the Paris trip at this table?
That was me. Oh. en chante.
Uh, excuse me is there a Mr. Bowmont at this table?
That's me. Ah.
Oh well, Hello. This is your lucky day, Mr. Bowmont.
The, uh, Gentleman Daysailer has become available again.
and I believe you made a bid of $18,000?
You have to pay that. It's not just a guess.
I was actually relieved, uh, I didn't win the boat.
My wife would've killed me.
Are you kidding? She'll love this boat!
Y-Yeah! What is your wife's name? It's Pam.
Pam. Oh God okay, Just imagine this. The Pam.
Aw.
I don't think she'd like that.
Okay. Uh, imagine this: The Mr. Bowmont.
I don't think so.
Okay, look. Let me paint you a little picture. All right.
You are setting sail up the Hudson. You've got the wind in your ha-Arms.
You get all that peace and quiet that you've always wanted.
You get back to nature. You can go fishing.
You get one of those hats, and people call you captain.
And then when you're old, Cappy.
What the hell. It's for a good cause. All right!
No way! It's mine! What?
The stuff you said, I want that!
But, Joey, you don't have $20,000!
Who cares? I'll make payments! whatever it takes, I want the Mr. Bowmont!
Oh, my God! You're back!
Let me see your hand!
Why do you want to see my hand?
I want to see what's in your hand, I wanna see the trash.
Ew, it's all dirty. You should throw this out.
0Kay.
What did you  guys just do? What happened?
Richard was there. I couldn't do it. Oh, no.
I was gonna do it tomorrow y'know,and surprise her. but now you've ruined it.
We didn't ruin it!
Who walks into a room and asks to see a person's hands?
Well, a palm reader, a manicurist, a hand doctor.
Glove salesman. Good one!
This is terrible. What am I gonna do?
Look, she only suspects something okay? She doesn’t know for sure, so just throw her off the track.
That’s right, I'll make her think, uh, marriage is the last thing on my mind.
Yeah. Convince her you're scared of commitment.
I can do that. I've had 30 years of practice.
Hey, being you is finally gonna pay off!
I had to go to the basement...
...some idiot keeps stuffing the chute with pizza boxes.
That guy's still doing that?
Hey. My God, you're here, let me see your hand!
No, you're too late! She already took out the trash!
Wow. I have never had such a healthy breakup.
She was such a grownup about it.
She didn't seem too immature for me.
Did I just make a huge mistake?
Ross? Wait!
Elizabeth, thank God. I was just thinking about--
You suck!
What?
0Kay.
Breakup's still on.
Okay, okay, Here she comes.
How do I look? Do I look like a guy who doesn't want to get married?
Yeah.
And, also, a little like a French guy.
I never noticed that before.
Hey, guys. Hey.
What are you up to?
Just hanging out. Talking about, uh, web sites.
Ha.
Ahem. We saw this really interesting website about marriage.
and how totally unnecessary it is.
and how it's just a way for governments to keep tabs on you.
Yeah, Big Brother. Ha, ha.
That's a little crazy.
Although I am y'know glad to hear that you're branching out on what you look at on the Internet.Yeah, well…
Y'know, it just got me thinking though, why would anybody want to get married?
Why? To celebrate the relationship. To solidify the commitment.
To declare your love for one another to the world.
Eh.
Okay. Well, that's good to know.
The Mr. Bowmont's here!
Hey Monica, there's a customer wants to compliment the chef, Shall I let him in?
Sure! I love this part!
Come on in. Hi.
Richard.
Actually, I'm not here to compliment the chef.
Oh. that's okay I hate when people come back to compliment the chef.
Like I've nothing better to do.
So what's up?
Well, it was great seeing you the other night.
Good to see you too.
Did you come down here to tell me that?
No. Came here to tell you something else.
Came here to tell you I still love you.
