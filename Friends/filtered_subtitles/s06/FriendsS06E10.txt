嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
摩妮卡让别人布置她的圣诞树012---Wow. Monica's letting other people help decorate her tree?
谁又把她灌醉了吗012---Did someone get her drunk again, or...?
圣诞节的意义不在于圣诞树012---Having a perfectly decorated tree is not what Christmas is about.
而在于  与所爱的人共度012---It's about being with the people that you love.
真好  布置好了012---That is nice. And we're done. Ta-da!
我总觉得它少了一股圣诞味012---I dunno what it is, It just doesn't quite feel like Christmas to me.
那这样呢012---Oh, here.
这样才像圣诞节012---See, now it feels like Christmas.

那是4千年前的事了012---And that was, like, 4000 years ago.
你开始讲古代  也差不多是那个时候012---So, pretty much around the same time that you started telling this story.
大家好  乔伊  怎么了012---Hey, you guys. Hey. What's up?
我不出门不行啊  吉宁在房间到处拉筋折腾012---I had to get out of the apartment. Janine's stretching all over the place.
随便一转头就看到她在012---Everywhere I look she's like...
难怪你无法抗拒012---I can see why that's hard to resist.
我好喜欢她012---I like her so much.
可惜她对你没感觉012---Aw, I'm sorry sweetie that she doesn’t feel the same way.
就是啊  她好可爱012---I know. And she's so sweet.
我好想喂她吃葡萄  帮她梳头012---I just want to feed her grapes and brush her hair.
你知道她不是猴子吧012---You are aware that she's not a monkey, right?
我已经对吉宁没感觉了012---I am so over Janine.
我原来觉得她火辣性感  但现在  没这回事了012---I mean, Yeah, at first I thought she was hot, but now she's like old news.
你们好  吉宁012---Hey, guys. Janine!

叫什么狄克摇滚狄奇之夜的012---It's called some sort of Dickin' Rockin' Dicky Eve.
慢着012---Hold it.
是《狄克克拉克新年摇滚之夜》吗012---Are you talking about Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve?
那不是我说的吗012---Yeah, that's what I said.
天哪  我们爱死那个节目了012---Oh, my God, we love that show!
从我有记忆以来  罗斯和我每年都看012---Ross and I have been watching it since I can remember.
内心深处的你还是个小胖妹  对吧012---Ah, you're still just a little fat girl inside, aren't you?
我今年要去  我要当狂欢派对来宾012---Well I'm gonna be on it this year. I'm gonna be one of the party people.
你要去当派对来宾   那些人最酷了012---You're gonna be a party person? Those guys rock the most!
他们叫我带人去  你愿意当我的舞伴吗012---Well they said to bring someone. Do you wanna be my dance partner?
当然了  我很愿意跟你跨年012---Totally! I would love to spend New Year's with you.
明天就要录影了  我也不太懂012---Well actually they're taping tomorrow. I don't understand why--
流程是这样的012---Well, how it works is...
时代广场的部分是现场直播012---...the part with Dick Clark in Times Square is actually live.
但他们会预录狂欢派对的画面012---But they tape some of the party stuff ahead of time.
知道的人并不多012---Yeah, Not a lot of people know that.
你们也想去吗012---Do you guys want to come too?
真的还假的  一言为定012---Are you serious? We are there!
你笑什么笑012---What are you laughing at?
我跟他交往过  但你还跟她在一起012---Well, I used to date him, but you're still going outwith her.
谢谢  那我们就一起去012---Thanks. Great, so we can all go together.
我得走了  回头见012---I gotta run. catch you later.
再见  吉宁012---Bye, Janine.
她是不是约我出去012---Did she just ask me out on a date?
应该不是012---I don't think so.
什么啊  她找他参加的可是千禧年最盛大的晚会啊012---What are you talking about? She invited him to the biggest party of the millennium.
但她也找了你和罗斯012---Yeah, but she also invited you and Ross.
很抱歉  那应该不算约会012---Yeah, honey, I'm sorry, I don't think that that was a romantic thing.
或许吧  但我有一个办法012---Well, maybe. But, hey, I know how I can find out.
我们不是要参加跨年晚会012---We're going to a New Year's Eve party, right? 
到了午夜  我可以亲她  要是她也回吻  漂亮012---So at midnight, I can kiss her. And if she kisses me back, great.
要是她说 "你干什么"012---If she says, "Dude, what the hell are you doing?"
我就说 "不是我  都是新年害的"012---I can say, "it wasn't me, it was New Year's."
比高中时罗斯想亲我要好012---Well, that's a lot better than Ross kissing me in high school...
他说他需要护唇膏012---...and saying that he did it because he needed Chap Stick.
那天很干燥012---It was a dry day.
我们要上《狄克克拉克新年摇滚之夜》012---We are going to Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve!
我的天哪012---Oh, my God!
我的天哪012---Oh, my God!
我的天啊012---Oh, my God!
听着  我录过影012---Okay, I've been on sets before...
我有些建议012---...so let me give you a little advice, alright?
虽然只是上电视  我们只管跳舞  没什么大不了的012---It's a show, but we're just dancing. It's no big deal.
最重要的是  耍酷012---Important thing to remember: Stay cool.
了解  好012---Got it. Okay.
天哪  跟我梦想的一样012---Oh, my God! It's just like I dreamed it!
全体集合012---Everyone! Gather up!
借过  借过012---Excuse us! Excuse us!
我们的做法是  音乐一放  你们就跳舞012---Here's what's gonna happen.The music's gonna start, you're gonna dance...
我们会录影  你们不要看镜头  有问题吗012---...we'll tape it. Don't look at the camera. Any questions?
我有  什么时候播出012---Uh, yeah, I have a question. Uh, when is this gonna air?
好  你们去那边跳012---Yeah. Now, uh, you guys dance over there...
你们  去那边跳  你们两个在这里012---...you guys, over there. and I want you two right around here,
其他人散开  罗斯012---And everyone else, spread out. Ross.
什么时候播出012---So when is it gonna air?
你找厨房  我找后面的柜子012---Okay, you look in the kitchen, I will look in the back closet.
不必浪费时间了  我在这里012---I can save you time, ladies. I'm right here.
钱德  你出去一下  这件事与你无关012---Yeah. Chandler why don't you take a walk? This doesn't concern you.
我们在找摩妮卡送的圣诞礼物012---We're looking for our presents from Monica.
什么  太差劲了012--- What? That's terrible!
不会  我们每年都找012---No-no, we do it every year!
那就不差劲了012---Oh, well, that makes it not terrible.
但我们从来就没找到过012---No, yeah, we never find them.
她老是打败我们  奸诈的查某012---She's always best at us that wily minx.
放心  我们找个l小时012---Don't worry, we're just gonna search here for an hour..
就会换到乔伊那边找  好吗012---...and then we'll go to Joey's and search, okay?
不好  你们不能找她送的礼物  我们一定要找012---No not okay, You can't look for Monica's presents.But we have to!
你们不一定要找  也不能找  因为我也住在这里012---No, you don’t have to, And you can't, because I live here too.
那你应该跟我们一起找012---Well, then you should look with us.
为什么012---Why?
钱德  你都不愁要送摩妮卡什么吗012---Chandler, Aren't you worried about what to get Monica for Christmas?
不会  我有个很棒的构想012---No, I have a great idea for a present for her.
就只有  很棒的构想  嗯012---Oh, that's it? A great idea? Oh, yeah?
那样是不够的  要是她送你一个大礼012---Chandler, that's not enough. I mean what if she gets you a great present...
两个普通礼和一堆小礼呢012---...two medium presents, and a bunch of little presents?
而你只送她一个大礼  她一定会很难过012---And you've just gotten her one great present? I mean that's just gonna make her feel bad.
那你为什么要让她难过  为什么  为什么012---Why would you do that to her Chandler? Why? Why?
有我帮忙  找得更快  没错012---If I help, we can find them faster! That's right!
逮到一个了012---Ooh! Ooh! We have a live one!
是梅西百货的袋子  对012---Oh, it's a Macy's bag! Yeah.
这是给谁的012---Aw! Ooh! Who's it for?
"亲爱的  你们真以为我会藏在沙发下012---"Dear Losers, do you really think I'd hide presents under the couch?
还有  钱德  我就知道你会让步"012---P.S. Chandler, I knew they'd break you."
她可能已经发现了012---Uh-oh. She may be onto us.
我们今年一定要找到012---We are so gonna find them this year.
你们刚才说会到对面去找   该不会是每年都去吧012---Y'know when you guys said you were gonna go across the hall and look. you don’t, you don’t do that every year do you?
是啊012---Yeah.
你们没有到我的柜子里面012---You don't, like go into the back of my closet...
翻我的健身袋底下吧012---...and look under my gym bag or anything?
没有  从来没有012---No. Never do that.
乔伊会托我保管东西  我看都没看过012---Because that's where Joey gave me some stuff to store that I've never seen before in my life! 
刚才的事是幻觉012---Okay, that did not just happen.
又有摄影机来了012---Okay, here comes another camera.
好  小意思  放轻松012---Right. No biggie. Stay loose.
他们为什么一直避开012---Why do they keep doing that? Ugh!
想上镜头就得上那些平台012---If we wanna get on camera, I think we have to get up on one of those platforms. 
他们一直拍平台上的人012---They've been taping those people up there all day.
没错012---Right.
你们为什么能上去012---Hey, what'd you guys do to get up on there?
我们有练过012---We learned how to dance.
你练舞时也忘了穿内裤吗012---Oh yeah? Well when you learned how to dance did you forget how to put on underpants?
对嘛012---Yeah!
你跳得很好嘛  是吗012---Hey, you're a good dancer. Really?
臀部再放松一点会更好012---Yeah, well you’d be better if you just loosened your hips a little.
怎么说   像这样012---What do you mean? Like this.
就是这样  跟着节奏摆动  好多了012---That's it. Feel the rhythm. That's better.
你去跟那个女生跳012---Okay, you’re dancing with that girl over there.
不  我们是一起来的  我们是一起的012---No-no-no-no-no we're together. Yeah, we came together.
我看不出来012---I don't see it.
你去跟那个高个子跳  高个子  举手012---You are dancing with the tall guy over there. Tall Guy, raise your hand!
不  老兄  拜托让我跟她跳  我很喜欢她  我觉得我有机会012---No-no hey buddy, please let me dance with that girl, I really like her and I think I have a shot..
真的  你觉得有  我觉得没有012---Really, you think so? I don't.
乔伊那里什么都没   等一下012---I couldn't find anything at Joey--Hey-hey, oh hey!
我们找到了012---Yeah, we found them.
在客房衣橱的外套后面012---They were in the guest room closet behind some coats.
你不必担心了  都是些烂东西012---Yeah, and you have nothing to worry about 'cos they're all crap!
那是我要送给你们的礼物012---Those are my gifts, I got them for you.
谢谢  钱德  好棒喔012---Oh. Thanks, Chandler, they're great!
这个奇怪的金属AZ是什么012---Well Chandler, what is this very weird, urn, metal A-Z thing?
那是书挡  是很棒的礼物012---Those are book ends. That's a great gift.
好  抱歉  谢谢你送的AZ (AZ音近屁股ass)012---Oh. Okay, I'm sorry. Thank you for my "az."
记得都放回衣柜里  好吧012---Make sure you put all that stuff back in the closet. okay.
好吗  好啦012---Yes, okay.
对了  你人真好  都搬家了012---By the way, I just gotta say, I think it's really nice of you that even after you moved...
还帮着乔伊保管东西012---...you still keep storing that stuff for Joey.
喂  舞女012---Hey, dancing girl?
我想上厕所012---Can I go to the bathroom?
来转一下012---Here we go. Yeah.
很辣喔  盖勒兄妹012---Looking good, Gellers!
还用你说012---We know!
你看那个脾气急躁的人  他专门指定上平台的人012---Hey, see that snippy guy over there? He's the one who decides who gets up on the platform.
我们应该去他面前跳  好012---We should go dance by him. Okay.
全部暂停012---Okay, everybody, hold!
接下来上平台的舞者有012---Next on the platforms are...

你们两个  酷012---You two! Cool!
请问一下012---Excuse me? Sir?
如果我不穿内裤会入选吗  摩妮卡012---Would it help if I weren't wearing underpants? Monica! 
会吗012---Would it?
高个子012---Hey, Tall Guy!
我想跟你聊聊你的舞伴012---listen, I want to talk to you about that girl you're dancing with.
她真不赖   我还差点带老婆来012---She's nice, huh? To think I almost brought my wife to this.
是啊  好012---Yeah. Yeah. Okay.
老兄   我和她是一起来的012---Uh, look buddy, I came with that girl, okay?
我想在新年倒计数时吻她012---and I had this plan to kiss her at the new years countdown.
我想追她012---I'm trying to win her over. you know--
不行012---No I don’t think so.
拜托啦  你可以跟我的舞伴跳012---Oh come on man, you can dance with my partner.
她跳得超级棒012---she's real, uh, mellow!
你在跟这个女生交往吗012---Look, are you dating this girl you came with?
我希望过了今晚可以012---I was hoping after tonight that maybe I could you know...
不  不  那就公平竞争  抱歉012---No. No. She's fair game if you ask me. Sorry, buddy.
好吧  嘿012---All right. Hey.
公平竞争  你说的对  我还能说什么012---y'know fair is fair,if you're right, you're right, what can I say,
嘿  不012---but hey oh no!
你是小学生吗012---Are you in second grade?

要是弄得老爸老妈如此嫉妒  最后却没上电视012---If Mom and Dad don't see us on TV after we made them jealous...
到时候谁是失败者012---...then who's gonna be the losers then?
我知道怎么上平台了  怎样012---Hey, I know what'll get us up on a platform. What?
跳招牌舞012---The routine!
我们中学毕业后就没跳过了012---Ross, we haven't done the routine since middle school.
等那个贱人看过我们的招牌舞012---Hey, when the snippy guy sees the routine...
搭都会帮我们搭一座平台012---...he'll want to build us our own platform.
有那么赞吗012---Was it that good?

假午夜快到了  我们还能怎样012---It's almost fake midnight. Do we really have any other choice?

你是叫我们要嗨  但他也嗨过头了吧012---I mean, I know you told us to show excitement, but don't you think he went a little overboard?

你们好012---On, hi, guys!
乌类的方向感很好012---Y'know, Birds have a very good sense of direction.
或许他们可以帮忙找出礼物012---and I thought maybe they could help us find where the presents are hidden.
如果礼物藏在南方过冬的话012---Yes, if the presents are hidden south for the winter.
顺着你的笑话去找也行  你知道在哪里吗  当然不知道012---Or we could just follow your clever jokes. Any ideas? Didn't think so.
来  把礼物找出来012---Come on, show us where the presents are.
鸭子似乎认为摩妮卡送我垃圾012---Oh, the duck seems to think that Monica got me garbage.
什么样的回礼能跟垃圾一样好012---I wonder what I could get Monica that's as good as garbage.
我的AZ如何012---Hmm. How about my “at”?
这是空的  什么012---Hey. This is hollow. What?
这排座椅  是空心的  我居然都不知道012---This bench, it's hollow. I can't believe I never knew that!

我不想知道摩妮卡送我什么012---I don't want to know what Monica got me.Y'know? I mean,look.
她一定很用心的替我找礼物  想给我惊喜012---I'm sure she worked hard at getting it and wanting to surprise me.
你们这样会坏了情绪012---And you guys are gonna ruin that.and I,
我们得把礼物放回去  这样不叫圣诞节012---look we have to put them back. this is not what Christmas is about.
谁理你  我要拆我的012---Whatever, Linus. I'm opening mine.
谁也不准拆012---Nobody is opening anything, okay?
但我想看摩妮卡  收到礼物的表情012---I want to see the look on Monica's face when I give her my present.
她一定也想看  我收到礼物的表情012---I'm sure she wants to see the look on my face when I get mine.
所以求求你们放回去  好吗012---So, please, please, can we just...? Can we put them back?

真是的012---Great.
你知道那个滤水器多难找吗012---Do you know how long it took me to find you that water purifier?
你送我滤水器  这下我懂了  那种表情无价012---That's what you got me? Yes, I see. That look is priceless.
甜蜜的家012---Home sweet home, huh?
回到现实真好012---Nice to, uh, get back to reality.
我们也知道新年会怎样了012---Plus, we, uh, know how the New Year's gonna go off.

你  想再亲一次吗012---So do you, uh, want to kiss again?
想啊  离除夕只有两个星期012---Sure. New Year's Eve is only two weeks away.
