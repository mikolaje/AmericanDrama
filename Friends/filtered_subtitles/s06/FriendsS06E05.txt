你居然没告诉我  我们还是夫妻012---Oh, I cannot believe that you didn't tell me we are still married.
我这不是正准备告诉你么012---Look, I was going to tell you.
什么时候   第一个私生子出生后012---When? After the birth of our first secret child?
罗斯没办注销   我们还是夫妻012---Ross didn't get the annulment. We are still married.
什么  我的天哪012---You're kidding? Oh, my God.
罗斯012---Ross.
或许这个决定不太好012---Okay, maybe it wasn't my best decision...
但我无法面对另一次失败婚姻012---...but I couldn't face another failed marriage.
我插个嘴012---Let me just jump in and ask.
你觉得这段婚姻哪里成功了012---At what point did you think this was a successful marriage?
瑞秋  别这样  其实想想  还蛮好笑的012---Rach, come on. If you think about it, it's actually kind of funny.
还是不要想好了012---Okay, maybe it's best not to think about it.
这真是不可原谅   我真是震惊到了极点012---Oh, this is inexcusable. I'm shocked to my very core.
菲比  我已经说你知道了012---Phoebe, I told her you already knew.
又在骗人  你真的有病012---Another lie. You have a sickness.
罗斯   我只是随便问问012---Ross, just for my own peace of mind...
你没娶我们其他人吧012---...you're not married to any more of us, are you?
老友记  第六季  第5集  名车狂想曲012---Friends  S06E05  The One With Joey's Porsche
有人掉了钥匙012---Oh, hey, someone left their keys.
是保时捷012---Ooh, to a Porsche.
阿甘  这是你的吗   是啊  我开保时捷012---Hey, Gunther, are these yours? Yeah. That's what I drive.
我时薪4块钱   存了350年012---I make 4 bucks an hour. I saved up for 350 years.
嘿  有人掉钥匙了吗012---Hey, did anybody lose their keys?
你可以放进失物招领箱012---Joey, why don’t you put them in the lost and found?
这里有失物招领箱012---There's a lost and found?
我的鞋子012---My Shoe!
你掉了一只鞋在这里012---You left a shoe here?
我回到家才发现012---Well, I didn't realize till I got home.
我才不要光着一只脚再回来012---I wasn't gonna walk all the way back down here with one shoe.
我要去找那辆车  然后留言012---I'm gonna go find that guy's car and leave a note on the windshield.
等他来了  我会把你的鞋子给他012---Oh, good. When he comes back for his keys, I'll be sure to give him your shoe.
太好了  谢谢012---Great. Thanks.
太好了  你们在这里  听着012---Oh, good, good. You guys are here. Listen.
明天起要不要一起照顾012---How would you like to spend tomorrow...
三只超可爱的小狗012---...taking care of three incredibly cute little puppies?
好棒啊  听起来好好玩012---Oh, my God. What a fun day. That sounds great.
好吧012---Yeah, all right.
好  我明早带他们过来012---Okay, well, I'll bring them by tomorrow morning.
对了  其实不是小狗012---Okay, and by the way, they're not actually puppies.
是法兰克的三胞胎  好  再见012---They're Frank and Alice's triplets. Okay, see you.
什么  什么012---Whoa, whoa, whoa. What?
拜托  法兰克他们012---Please, please, please? Frank and Alice...
托我带小孩  我好紧张  我一个人没带过012---...asked me to baby sit the triplets and I’m nervous ‘cause I’ve never done that before by myself!
放心  菲比  我们一定会帮忙012---Don’t worry about it Phoebe, we’ll absolutely do it.
我就不了  如果是狗狗我就很犹豫了012---Yeah, I'm gonna pass, because I was kind of iffy when it was puppies.
好啦  钱德  这是练习的好机会啊012---Come on, Chandler. Come on, it'll give us great practice for when...
总会有客人带小孩来012---...people with babies come to visit.
好车012---Nice car.
但不是我的012---Yeah, it's, uh-It's not mine.
我喜欢你的车  它是我的012---I love your car. Yeah. It's mine.
一定很能跑  我想也是012---I bet it's fast. Me too. Yeah.
而且很舒服012---And comfortable.
你喜欢皮椅吗  喜欢012---Do you, uh, like leather seats? Yeah.
它有皮椅012---It's got them.
这里还有我的东西012---So, I still have boxes here.
罗斯家也有我的东西012---I still have boxes at Ross'.
而我却没地方住012---And I have nowhere to live.
我现在应该要发狂才对啊012---Wow, I could so easily freak out right now.
那我呢012---What about me?
我刚发现狄妮丝要出远门  我没室友了012---I just found out Denise is leaving town for a while. I don't have a roommate.
也许我可以当你的室友  菲比012---Well, maybe I could be your roommate, Pheebs.
也对啊  可以啊012---Maybe you could be my roommate.
有办法了  没错012---Well, there's an idea. Yeah.
太好了012---That would be great. Oh.
狄妮丝要去多久  她说她12月26日回来012---Wait, how long is Denise gone for? Um, she said she'd be back December 26th.
12月26日012---Oh! December 26th.
也许她是圣诞老公公012---Heh, maybe she's Santa Claus.
看  是谁  我老公  我的心肝宝贝012---Oh, look who it is. My husband, the apple of my eye.
我已经约好明天2点出庭012---Okay, I got us a court date for tomorrow at 2...
表格也都拿了012---...and I picked up all the forms.
我会搞定012---I'll take care of everything.
当然   既然你说你会搞定012---Sure, if you say you're gonna take care of everything...
我当然没理由怀疑你了012---...I have no reason to doubt you.
拿来啦012---Give me those forms.
好吧  我要照我的方式去做  你不准叽叽歪歪012---All right, now, I'm gonna do this my way, and I don't wanna hear a peep out of you.
好  但是  你在叽叽歪歪嘛012---Okay, Rash, but--Ah, you're peeping.
你知道吗  我实在是012---Ross, you know what? I just got--
你为什么要这样  我说过012---Why? Why did you do this? Look, I told you--
我不想听 "三次失败的婚姻"012---I don't wanna hear "three failed marriages."
如果你失败过两次  就会了解了012---Look, if you'd had two failed marriages, you'd understand.
多亏了你   我现在只差一次012---Well, you know what? Thanks to you, I'm half way there.
我快气死了  罗斯  我从来没有这么气过012---Oh, I am so mad, Ross. I don't think I've ever been this angry.
我说我们分手了的那次呢012---What about the time I said we were on a break?
哦012---Oh.
菲比  你那边怎样012---Pheebs, how's it going?
还好  你觉得他们开心吗  我讲话太快了吗012---I'm doing okay. Do you think they're having fun? Am I talking too fast?
不会  跟我差不多012---No. You sound like me.
一切都很好  你看钱德和小女生钱德012---It's going great. Look at Chandler with Little Baby Girl Chandler.
小女生钱德   我在哪里听过   对了  鲁本教练012---Little Baby Girl Chandler. Where have I heard that before? Oh, right, Coach Rubin.
菲比012---You know what, Pheebs?
等你那边忙完  我们这里也有状况了012---When you're done over there, we've got a kind of situation over here too.
不行  自己的小孩要自己照顾012---Uh-uh. No. We are all responsible for our own babies.
那你就错了  我们一直采取人盯人战术012---See, that's where I think you're wrong. We've been playing them man-to-man.
但我们应该打区域联防的012---We should really be playing a zone defense.
什么意思012---What do you mean?
我觉得一人守一区012---I just think things will go smoother...
会比较顺畅   菲比  你可以负责擦屁屁012---...if we each have our own zone, you know? Phoebe, you can be in charge of wiping.
摩妮卡  你负责包尿布012---And, Mon, you can be in charge of diapering.
我就负责看他们抓着我的手012---And I can be in charge of looking at how cute they are when they put their hands...
好主意  也许你才应该擦屁屁012---That sounds really great, but you should be in charge of wiping.
我是菜鸟   不该守球门区012---Okay, I'm a rookie. I should not be in the end zone.
哇啊哦  真好012---Wow, this is so great.
餐厅都应该这样准备餐点的012---This is exactly how we set the plates at the restaurant.
是吗  我可不是点的这个012---Yeah? Well, this is not what I ordered.
大家好  嗨012---Hey, guys. Hey.
宝宝们好012---Hey, babies.
早上真过瘾012---I'm having the best morning.
钥匙在我这儿的那辆保时捷  还在012---That, uh, Porsche I've got the keys to? Still there.
不会吧  毕竟钥匙在你手上012---Shocking, since you still have the keys.
你应该看看  大家对我的态度012---You should see the treatment I get when I'm with that car.
每个人都很友善  找我聊天  而且不只是聊车子012---People are friendly. They wanna talk. And not just about the car.
还有人教我投资策略012---One guy advised me on my equity investments.
什么投资策略012---What equity investments?
赚到保时捷的股票投资  你跟上好吗012---The ones that got me the Porsche. Will you keep up?
但要是我光杵在那里012---I figured, if people keep seeing me just standing there...
别人会觉得那不是我的车012---...they're gonna start to think I don't own it.
所以我要洗车  摩妮卡  你有水桶和肥皂吗012---So I figure I'll wash it, right? Monica, you got a bucket and some soap?
有  我有肥皂  海绵  抹布012---Oh, yeah. I got soap and sponges and rags...
亮光腊和打腊工具组012---...and carnauba wax and polishing compound.
你根本没有车012---You don't even have a car.
对  但是有一次  楼下停过一辆很脏的车012---I know. But one time there was this dirty car parked in front of the building...
我就把它给洗了012---...so I washed it.
还有呢  还有另外六辆012---And? And six others.
这就对了012---There you are.
它可以飙到130012---Yeah, she tops out at 130. Wow.
这还是在市内  出了市区到上州可以飙到160012---And that's just in the city. I get her up to 160 upstate.
是吗  你在上州也有房子012---Really? You got a place upstate?
当然012---Sure.
改天见  好  慢走012---Well, I'll see you later. Okay. Take it easy.
喂  那是我的车012---Hey. That's my car.
是吗012---Really? Oh, uh...
再给我5分钟012---Just give me five more minutes.
你在干什么012---What are you doing?
我捡到钥匙  现在帮它打腊012---Well, I found the keys, and now I'm just polishing her up.
但这是我的车  这是我的腊012---But it's my car. Yeah, but it's my wax.
听着  我很少进市区012---Listen, I don't come to the city much.
我不知道你是疯子  还是在演街头剧012---And I don't know if you're crazy or if this is some kind of street theater...
但请把钥匙还给我012---...but could I have my keys?
拿去  我帮你占了车位012---Sure. Yeah. I'll save your parking spot.
我不回来了012---I'm not coming back.
为什么  我住在上州012---Why not? I live upstate.
是啊  我本来也是012---Yeah, so did I.
我之前不晓得在紧张什么012---I don't know why I was so nervous about this...
法兰克他们为什么会抱怨  带孩子太容易了012---...and I don't know why Frank and Alice are always complaining. This is so easy.
是啊  2小时和一辈子能一样嘛012---Yeah, two hours, a lifetime, that's the same.
你们看  宝宝醒来后012---Check it out. Check it out. When the babies wake up...
可以认识克洛格012---...they can meet Krog.
你在干什么   那个东西会害人的012---What are you doing? That thing could put someone's eye out.
不止害人  他还能毁灭宇宙012---He can do more than that. He can destroy the universe.
不  钱德  宝宝可能会误食那些零件012---No, Chandler, they could swallow one of those little parts.
而且  那个光滑的部位  会误导他们012---And also, look at his smooth area. That's just gonna mess them up.
他们才不会误食什么  你们这叫保护过度012---They're not gonna swallow anything. You're too overprotective.
我小时候   我妈都把我扔在碎玻璃堆里012---When I was a kid, my mom used to just throw me into a pile of broken glass.
什么  玻璃  沙子  还不都一样嘛012---What? Glass, sand, whatever.
小莱丝莉边睡边伸懒腰012---Oh, look at little Leslie stretching in her sleep.
好可爱喔012---Oh, it's so cute.
不知道要到几岁  才没办法把腿举到头上012---I wonder what age it is when you stop putting both legs behind your head.
我现在还是可以012---Oh, I can still do that.
你怎么会还没结婚012---How are you still single?
好吧   我想或许你们说得对012---All right, ahem. I thought about it, and maybe you're right.
或许克洛格不够安全012---Maybe Krog is not a safe toy.
你为什么改口了  我吞了音波死光枪012---Good. What made you change your mind? I swallowed his sonic blaster gun.
怎么会这样012---How did that happen?
我想证明我是对的012---Well, I was trying to prove that I was right, you know?
结果   我错了012---And it turns out I was wrong...
现在它还卡在我的喉咙里012---...and now it's lodged in my throat.
真是的  我们光顾着带小孩012---Damn it, this whole time we were concentrating on the babies...
都忘了要看着钱德了012---...and no one was watching Chandler.
两位  要申请注销婚姻012---Okay, you two are asking the court for an annulment?
是的  申请表  都填好了012---Yes, Your Honor. And here are our forms, all filled out.
根据申请书所言012---So based on your petition...
你申请注销的理由是012---...you are seeking an annulment on the grounds...
盖勒先生的精神状况不稳定012---...that "Mr. Geller is mentally unstable."
好  我精神状况不稳定012---Fine. I'm mentally unstable.
而且  他使用静脉注射毒品012---And based on the fact that "Mr. Geller is an intravenous drug user."
什么  是的  海洛因与快克012---What? Uh, yes. Heroin and crack.
快克根本不是静脉注射毒品012---Crack isn't even an intravenous drug.
你当然知道012---Well, you would know.
这上面还说012---Now, it also says here that you:
"你在婚前隐瞒性向"012---"Lied about your sexual preference before marriage."
拜托  罗斯  我发现那些杂志了012---Oh, come on. Ross, please. I found the magazines.
还有  你"无法履行夫妻间的义务"012---And, finally, that you were "unable to consummate the marriage."
这也难怪  你是同志  又打海洛因012---Well, that makes sense since you're gay and addicted to heroin.
很抱歉  这也太夸张了012---Okay, you know, I'm sorry, this is insane.
我没有打海洛因  我不是同志012---I'm not addicted to heroin, I'm not gay, and there is no problem...
我履行什么都没问题012---...with my ability to consummate anything.
我现在就可以在这里履行  现在012---Look, I'll consummate this marriage right here, right now.
没有这个必要012---That won't be necessary.
我们交往时  简直跟兔子有得一拼012---And when we were dating, we consummated like bunnies.
如果你们曾经认真交往  那就有问题了012---Now, if you two were involved in a serious relationship, that really creates a problem.
大人  我们2年前就分手了012---Your Honor, rest assured, that relationship ended two years ago.
可以删掉 "跟兔子有得一拼" 吗012---And can you please strike "consummated like bunnies" from the record.
这份申请书有任何实话吗012---Is there anything in this record that is actually true?
有  我们确实在赌城结婚012---Uh, well, yes. We got married in Vegas.
名字应该也没错012---And, uh, the names, I think.
好吧  但从刚才的话来听012---Well, based on what I've heard...
两位不符合注销资格012---...you two certainly don't qualify for an annulment.
如果你们不想在一起   就必须办理离婚012---If you don't wanna be together, you'll have to file for divorce.
太好了  你高兴了吗  都是你的搞笑表格害的012---That's great. You happy now? Look what you did with your funny, funny form.
什么  我的表格   你那句"跟兔子有得一拼"呢012---What? Me? What about you and your "consummated like bunnies" nonsense?
那  你打什么打012---And what--? What are you typing that for?
你没听到嘛  我们不能办注销了012---She already said we don't get the annulment.
不要打了012---Don't type that. What--?
别再打了012---Stop typing. Hey.
别再打了012---Stop typing.
别打了  "别打了"012---Stop typing, "stop typing"
你看你  让我嫁的是什么人啊012---Okay, okay, do you see what you're keeping me married to?
请两位离开我的办公室012---You need to get out of my chambers.
好  你给我听着012---All right, lady, here's the deal.
我是来办注销的  没办成我绝对不走012---I came here for an annulment, and I'm not leaving here until I get one.
你们想在牢里过夜吗   耽误您了012---Would you like to spend the night in jail? Thank you for your time.
保时捷的主人把车开走了012---That Porsche guy took his car back.
但你捡到的是他的衣橱钥匙012---But you found the keys to his clothes?
不是  我只是012---No, I just, uh...
我只是喜欢  大家以为我有保时捷的感觉012---I love the way it feels when everybody thinks I own a Porsche.
你穿这样   别人就会以为你有了012---People would think you own a Porsche because of the clothes?
那当然012---Of course.
白痴才会没车还穿成这样子012---Only an idiot would wear this stuff if he didn't have the car.
那倒是012---That is true.
不过应该只有天才  才会误食音波死光枪012---Yeah, but only a genius would swallow a sonic blaster gun.
我也误食过012---Oh, I've been there.
我要去开我的保时捷了012---I am gonna go drive my Porsche.
乔伊   你知道你没有保时捷吧012---Joey, you know you don't actually have one.
拜托  你搞什么  我正在入戏   你说说她012---Come on. What are you doing? I'm in character. Will you talk to her?
感觉它动了  它真的在戳我啊012---Ah, I think it just moved. It's really poking me.
够了  我们去挂急诊012---That's it. We're going to the emergency room.
什么  不  你们不能把我扔给他们  我们正在带孩子012---What? No, you can't leave me here with them. We're babysitting.
宝宝都睡了  你撑一下应该没问题啊012---The babies are asleep. I'm sure you'll be okay on your own.
但你们不能把我扔给他们  我们是一队的012---But you can't leave me with them. We're a team.
在打区域联防  他们会以三打一012---We're playing a zone. They're gonna triple-team me.
他的喉咙卡了个塑胶玩具  我们必须去医院啊012---He's got something plastic in his throat. We gotta go to the hospital.
但医生也帮不了他  反正012---But, no, because a doctor won't be able to help him. And it's just gonna, you know...
过个7年就会自动排出012---...naturally pass through his system in, like, seven years.
那是口香糖   我确定是死光枪012---I think that's gum. I'm pretty sure it's gun.
听着  真的很痛啊  我们走吧012---Okay, listen, this really hurts. Let's go.
男子汉才不会冲去医院012---But no. A real man wouldn't just run to the hospital.
克洛格会怎么做012---No. What would Krog do?
泊车小弟怎么还没  把我的保时捷开来012---Why isn't that valet back with my Porsche?
也许因为钥匙在你手上嘛012---Maybe because you've got the keys?
都是你的错  我的错  你威胁法官012---That was totally your fault. My fault? You threatened the judge.
你把书记员的打字纸撕下来012---Well, you ripped the paper out of the court reporter's machine.
那样才能让他打不下去012---That was the only way I could get him to stop typing!
盖勒夫妇好吗012---Hi. How are the Gellers?
不要那样叫012---Don't call us that.
法官不准我们办注销  我们只能去办离婚了012---The judge wouldn't let us get an annulment. Now we gotta get a divorce.
你被保捷附身了吗012---Did a Porsche throw up on you?
嘿012---Hey
是"保时捷"啊012---It's "Porsche."
我完全可以照顾你们  对吧012---Me taking care of you is no problem, huh?
你们觉得很安心吧012---You guys feel safe, right?
吐泡泡就表示〝安心〞012---Okay, I'm gonna take that spit bubble as a "Yeah, I do."
我扔了脏尿布  就帮你换一块干净的012---Let's get rid of this dirty diaper, Leslie. I'll set you up with a nice clean one.
抱歉  我不是故意的  我得先清理一下012---Okay, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you. I just have to clean that up, okay?
这是摩妮卡的家012---Because, let's face it, we're at Monica's.
破了  反正东西迟早都会坏012---I broke it. All right. Well, that's just the way things go.
好  就这样012---Okay. Good.
为什么只剩两个012---Why are there only two of you?
莱丝莉呢012---Where's Leslie?
你们不会说话  莱丝莉  你在哪里012---Well, you can't answer. Leslie? Where are you, Leslie?
莱丝莉  现在是开口说话的好时机012---Leslie, now would be a good time for your first words.
你看看你012---Well, look at you.
嘿012---Hey.
你有点点调皮喔  真是的012---You are a little bit mischievous. My gosh.
是非常皮012---Oh, you're a lot mischievous.
反正会干的012---Well, it'll dry.
去跟哥哥妹妹躺在一起012---Okay, you sit with your brother and sister now...
他们不在012---...who aren't there.
你还好吗012---Hey. How do you feel?
再过12到14小时  克洛格就又能012---Well, let's just say that Krog will be equipped to destroy the universe again...
毁灭宇宙了012---...in 12 to 14 hours.
我一个人把孩子都带好了012---Okay, so I totally took care of the babies all by myself.
喂奶  洗澡  哄他们睡觉012---I fed them, bathed them and put them to bed.
还保护他们躲过龙卷风012---And protected them from a tornado?
我的天哪012---Oh, my God.
对啊  宝宝都睡了012---I know. The babies are asleep.
菲比  家里是怎么了012---Phoebe, what happened here?
我做到了  我一个人照顾宝宝012---I did it. I took care of the babies all by myself.
但是我的房子  成了菲比胜利的战场012---But my apartment. Was the setting of Phoebe's triumph.
但是这里乱的012---But the mess.
比起菲比的辛劳实在不算什么012---Is not as important as the fact that Phoebe took care of the babies all by herself.
你说得对  我不该大惊小怪012---You're right. You're right, I shouldn't freak out.
等我们有了孩子  也会这样012---‘Cause this is what will happen when you and I have babies!
那得等到什么时候呢012---When will that be?
菲比  你看你弄得多乱012---Phoebe, would you take a look at this mess?
亲爱的  你总算回来了  我都开始担心了012---Oh, honey, thank God you're home. I was getting worried.
我去领了离婚证书012---I picked up the divorce papers.
该签的我都签了 你要签的地方我也画了叉012---Uh, I've already signed everything. And I put little X's where you need to sign.
画叉  真好  这样就前嫌尽释了012---Oh, little X's. Great. That makes up for everything.
你也干过很多蠢事  好吗012---You know, you've done a lot of stupid stuff too, okay?
有哪一件事情跟这次一样蠢012---Oh, name one stupid thing that is as stupid as this one.
你飞去伦敦阻止我结婚怎么说012---Okay, how about you flew to London to stop my wedding?
我已经结婚了  你还说你爱我012---How about you told me you loved me after I was married?
慢着  那不一样012---Wait a minute, that was different.
我做那些事  是因为我爱你012---I did those things because I was in love with you.
正是012---Yeah. Right.
你说得对  的确很不一样012---You're right. That's very different.
总之赶快签一签吧012---So let's just sign the papers.
怎样  没事了012---What? Nothing.
请签名012---Okay, can we just sign, please?
恭喜你012---Congratulations.
罗斯   等一下012---Okay, wait, Ross. Wait a minute. Um...
我有一件事要坦白012---I, uh, kind of have a little confession.
什么事012---What?
你知道  结婚这件事012---Uh, well, you know, this whole marriage thing.
算是我的主意012---Kind of my idea.
什么012---Excuse me?
我们不是醉到那天晚上的012---Well, remember how we were too drunk to remember anything...
什么事都想不起来012---...the night we were married?
怎样012---Yeah?
我很不想说012---And yeah, I didn't really wanna say anything...
但是我的记忆一直回来012---...but it just kind of kept coming back to me.
记不记得  我们在赌场012---Um, remember, we were in the casino...
你突然觉得   狂吃葡萄会很好玩012---...and for some reason, you thought it'd be funny to eat a lot of grapes.
然后我觉得  我们结婚一定会更好玩012---And I thought it would be funnier if we got married.
于是我们折衷  先去结婚012---So, ahem, as a compromise, we decided first to get married and then...
然后再去吃很多葡萄012---...(Ross joins in) to eat a lot of grapes.
因此012---So, um...
抱歉  惹出这些麻烦012---Sorry I got us into this whole thing.
所以  仔细想想012---So then, I mean, if you think about it...
这一切都是你的错012---...this is all your fault.
不要得寸进尺012---Yeah, don't push it, though.
我知道012---I gotta say...
我跟很多女人离过婚012---...I know I divorce a lot of women.
却从来没想过会跟你离婚012---Never thought I'd be divorcing you.
我知道012---I know.
我总觉得要是我们结婚   一定会天长地久012---I always thought if you and I got married, that would be the one that stuck.
不会是秘密结婚012---And it wouldn't be a secret...
更不会在必胜客请吃酒席012---...and we wouldn't have our wedding dinner at Pizza Hut.
我有请客吗012---Did I even treat?
没有  那是免费的  新婚夫妇特惠012---No, it was on the house. It was a newlywed special.
我没听过这么令人沮丧的事012---That may be the most depressing thing I've heard in my life.
我去律师那里送件012---Well, I should probably get these to my lawyer's office.
谢谢你  罗斯  把事情都办妥了012---Hey, thanks, Ross, for taking care of all this.
不客气012---Ah, no problem. Yeah.
我要份副本  没问题012---I'm gonna need a copy of those. Totally.
嗯012---Yeah.
嘿   嘿   别在我的保时捷旁边乱跑012---Hey, hey, hey. Careful around my Porsche.
乔伊  嘿012---Hi, Joey. Hey.
你们好吗012---How you doing?
他有一辆最拉风的保时捷012---He has the most amazing Porsche under there.
我很想给你们看看  但我刚刚哄她睡着了012---I'd love to show you, but I just tucked her in. She's sleeping.
嘿  两位  要不要去喝杯酒啊012---Hey, would you two girls like to go for a drink?
