嘿012---Hey.
我刚拿到教师评监表  你们听这个学生写的012---I just got my teacher evaluations. Check out what this one student wrote.
"我爱盖勒博士的课   令人大呼过瘾"012---"I loved Dr. Geller's class. Mind-blowing lectures.
"盖勒博士  您是古生物学系的猛男"012---Dr. Geller, you are definitely the hottie of the Paleontology Department."
"古生物学系的猛男"012---Ah, "Hotties of the Paleontology Department."
做成月历一定好卖012---There's a big-selling calendar, huh?
谁写的012---Who wrote it?
我也想知道  但评监表是匿名的012---Oh, I wish I knew, but the evaluations are all anonymous.
期末考卷还在吗   在啊012---Do you still have their final exams? Yeah.
你可以拿考卷来对笔迹   就知道仰慕者是谁了012---Oh,‘cause you can just match the evaluation to the exam with the same handwriting and boom, there's your admirer.
只要和女色有关  他就成了大天才012---A hot girl's at stake and all of a sudden he's Rain Man.
等等  等等  为何确定一定是个女生012---Hey, wait a minute, wait a minute. Why are we so sure that this is a girl?
是女生012---It's a girl.
对啊  总之没差012---Anyway, it wouldn't matter, okay?
因为我是老师  她是学生  那要违反校规的012---Because I'm a teacher. She's a student. Oh, is that against the rules?
不会  但是会有争议  了解012---No, but it is frowned upon. I see.
而且年龄相差那么多  你就这么想  等你90岁012---Besides, there's a big age difference. Think of it like this. When you're 90--
我知道  我90她就80012---I know, when I'm 90, she'll be 80...
感觉就差不多了012---..and it won't seem like such a big difference.
不是  我不是要说这个012---No, that's not what I was gonna say at all.
我是说等你90岁012---What I was gonna say is when you're 90...
还能拥有跟20岁小妹妹恋爱的回忆012---...you'll still have the memory of what it was like to be with a 20-year-old.
老友记  第六季  第18集  师生恋情012---Friends  S06E18  The One Where Ross Dates A Student
嘿  钱德  你知道你那个当上电影导演的大学同学吗012---Hey Chandler! you know that girl you went to college with who became a movie director?
知道  黛娜基史东  我们一起修过动作课012---Oh, yeah, Dana Keystone. She was in my movement class.
什么是动作课012---What's a movement class?
钱德在假装他没修过默剧012---It's Chandler's way of pretending he didn't take mime.
总之  她要导艾尔帕西诺的新片012---Oh well listen, anyway, she's directing the new Al Pacino movie.
你得帮我争取试镜  我不知道  我们10年没联络了012---You gotta get me an audition. Oh. I don't know man.I haven't talked to her in like 10 years.
不  求求你  钱德  就当我欠你012---Oh, no, no, no. please-please Chandler I-I-I would owe you so much.
你本来就欠我   你欠我3千4百012---You do owe me so much. You owe me 3400--
嘿   老兄   你干嘛转移话题   什么012---Hey, hey, dude. Why you changing the subject? What?
你打不打电话  好吧  我试试看012---Will you make the call or what? Okay, I'll try.
万岁  谢了  你最好了012---All right. Thanks, you're the best.
试镜是星期四截止   我星期四之前得过去012---The last day of auditions is Thursday, so I gotta get in by Thursday.
记得星期四   就对了  你记得是星期四吗012---Just remember Thursday. Thursday. Can you remember Thursday?
星期二吗012---Yeah, so Tuesday?
是星期四  你如果记不住  就记是012---Thursday. Look, if you need help remembering, just think of it like this.
第三天  好吧  星期一   一天012---The third day. All right? Monday, one day.
星期二   二天012---Tuesday, two day.
星期三   三小  哪一天星期四012---Wednesday, when, huh, what day? Thursday.
第三天   好吗012---The third day, okay?
谢谢你  不客气012---Thank you. Okay.
嘿  摩妮卡  我要听留言  你在厕所里想到这个012---Hey, Mon, I'm gonna check my messages. You just thought of that in there?
当然  生理需求结束  她想知道还有谁需要她012---Sure, you know, nature called. She wants to see who else did.
喂012---Hello?
嗯012---Uh...
瑞秋012---Rachel.
我们家有人  快报警012---You guys, someone is in our apartment. Call the cops.
你在用电话012---You're on the phone.
天哪  天哪   什么012---Oh, my God. What?
天哪  谢谢你  是消防队012---Oh, my God. Thank you. That was the Fire Department.
家里失火了  天哪   有多严重012---There was a fire at our place. Oh, my God. How bad was it?
他没说  但失火总是不太妙嘛012---He didn't say, but it was a fire. I'm guessing not very good.
快走吧  快走  菲比  快点012---Come on, we gotta go. Phoebe, come on.
笑什么笑   有什么好笑的012---What are you smiling about? What is so funny?
我要应征的角色是消防队员   这真是天意012---The part I wanna audition for is a fireman. This is so meant to be.
哇  你这学期的成绩给得很大方啊012---Wow. Looks like you were very generous with your grades this semester.
盖勒教授  是012---Professor Geller? Yeah? Huh?
我只是要说   我很喜欢你的课012---I wanted to say how much I enjoyed your class.
谢谢你  非常感谢012---Oh, thank you. Thanks very much. Ow.
很不好意思   在评监表说你是猛男012---I'm a little embarrassed about calling you a hottie on my evaluation.
那就是你   对012---That was you? Yeah.
我后来觉得怪怪的  你是老师  我是学生012---I felt a little weird about it. You're a teacher. I'm a student.
但或许你愿意和我约会012---But would you maybe wanna go out with me sometime?
喔   我想  这样恐怕不太好吧012---Oh, I-Heh. I don't think that would be the best idea.
我想说学期结束后012---Oh, because I was thinking, um, the semester's over.
你就不是我的老师了  什么时候012---You're not my teacher anymore. What time?
当我没说   你已经给我A了012---Oh, you know what? Forget it. I see you already gave me an A.
了解   开玩笑的012---Gotcha. I'm kidding. Ha-ha-ha.
哇哦  哈哈哈012---Oh. Ha-ha-ha. Ha-ha-ha.
说真的  什么时候012---So seriously, what time?
借过  借过  你好012---Coming through. Oh. Coming through. Oh. Hello. Hi.
不  不对  借过012---No, right. Corning through.
还好嘛012---Oh. Okay. Well, it's not so bad.
灾情主要集中在卧房012---Yeah, Most of the damage is pretty mostly contained to the bedrooms.
天哪012---Oh, my God.
老兄   这星期四可以跟你借制服吗012---Hey, buddy, you think I could borrow your uniform this Thursday?
什么   乔伊   人家在忙012---Excuse me? Joey. He's working.
你穿一定很帅012---You would look good in that.
灾情如何   很惨  非常的惨012---Uh-oh. How bad is it? Oh, it's bad, it's really bad.
只有一把斧头没被烧到   我根本不记得有买过012---The only thing that isn't burned is an ax, which I do not remember buying.
瑞秋  你的呢  东西都烧光了012---How's your room, Rach? Everything's ruined.
床铺  衣服  你看我最喜欢的蓝毛衣012---My bed, my clothes. Look at my favorite blue sweater.
那不是我的吗012---Isn't that mine?
好吧   我对你的损失深表遗憾012---Fine. I'm sorry for your loss.
这里暂时不能住人了012---So uh, you're not gonna be able to live here for a while.
你们有地方去吗012---You ladies have a place to stay? Oh. Wow.
好  你听着012---Okay, look, pal...
老兄   我现在没心情跟人搭讪012---...I am not in the mood to be hit on right now.
不过要是你给我电话   我改天会打给你012---But if you give me your number, I will call you some other time.
她们可以跟我们住012---Yes, they can stay with us.
请问起火原因是什么   消防员012---Have you figured out what started the fire, Mr. Fireman?
你们有人抽烟吗012---Well, uh, do either of you smoke?
没有012---No, not usually.
不过现在来一根也好   谢谢  不012---But yeah, I could use one now. Thanks. No, no.
你们有人点蜡烛烧香吗   有  我常点  我很喜欢012---Do you light candles, burn incense? Yes, I do all the time. I love them.
天哪  是我害的  是我  是我012---Oh, my God, I did it. It's me, it's me.
我把房子给烧了   我把房子给烧了012---I burned down the house. I burned down the house!
菲比  别激动  没有必要怪谁  好吗012---Okay, Phoebe, calm down. There's no need to place blame. Okay?
我警告过她012---I warned her about those candles.
能聊聊真好   居然这么久了012---It's great to catch up. I can't believe how long it's been.
钱德   是不是012---Hey, Chandler, is that...?
太好了  恭喜你  听着012---Oh, that's great. Good for you. So, hey, hey, is it...?
好  我们可以见个面012---Okay, so, yeah, maybe we can get together, um...
你等我一下怎样012---Can you hold on for one second, please?
什么012---What?
等你讲完   要不要叫彼萨012---When you're off the phone, you wanna get a pizza?
嗨   我回来了012---Hi, I'm back.
听起来不错   好  就这么决定  好  再见012---Yeah, that sounds great. Okay, well, we'll do it then. Okay, bye.
我什么时候试镜  我知道是星期四  但是几点012---Hey, listen, so when's my audition? I know it's Thursday, but what time?
嗨  嘿  我们没聊到那个012---Hi. We didn't get to the audition.
我带她去喝咖啡时再说吧  好012---I'm gonna take her to coffee and do it then. Ah.
哇  你要跟这个女生约会012---Wow, so now you're going on a date with this girl?
这不是约会  我们失联10年了012---Not a date. I haven't talked to her in 10 years.
总不能一通电话过去  就要人家帮忙吧012---You can't call somebody you haven't talked to in 10 years and ask for a favor.
要讲人情世故   花点时间客套012---There are rules, you know? You gotta put in some time.
没错  对不起012---You're right, I'm sorry.
你又不是去见旧情人  不  我们只约过一次会012---It's not like you're going out with an ex. No, we only went out once.
你跟她交往过012---You dated her?
一次也没有012---Not once.
干脆我也去找个前男友  来帮乔伊的忙012---Great. Why don't I just go outwith an ex, you know, and do Joey a favor?
想帮乔伊的忙   就跟乔伊约会012---Hey, you wanna do Joey a favor? Maybe you go out with Joey.
真好   我朋友乔伊也在电影圈012---Oh. That's great. My friend Joey's in the movie business.
你猜我那天遇见谁   豪伊012---Mm. You know who I ran into from school? Howie.
我的朋友叫乔伊012---Hmm. My friend's name is Joey. Heh.
显然  豪伊在当剪接师012---Apparently, Howie's editing now.
他打来问我能不能剪我的新片012---Yeah, he calls me up and asks me if he can edit my new movie.
你相信吗012---Heh. Can you believe that?
我们10年没联络012---You know, I haven't spoken to him in, what, 10 years...
他居然来找我帮忙012---...and he asks me for a favor?
我一向很讨厌那家伙012---Yeah, I've always hated that Howie.
连声好都没问过012---No "How you doing?" Heh.
连先喝一杯咖啡都没有012---Man, I mean, not even a cup of coffee first.
好大胆   就是啊012---Heh. The nerve, huh? Yeah.
续杯吗012---Refill?
这是等待已久的时刻   但是抱歉  房里一团乱012---Now, this is last-minute, so I want to apologize for the mess.
没人介意啊012---Oh.  Who cares?
天哪012---Oh, my God.
我住的这儿的时候   绝对不是长这样012---It sure didn't look this way when I lived here.
我知道012---I know.
问题是  这里012---Now look, There's only one problem, though.
只能睡一个人  另一个人得去住乔伊家012---There's only room for one, so I guess one of you will have to stay at Joey's.
既然火算是我放的   你就睡这里吧012---Well, since the fire was kind of my fault, I guess you should get to stay here.
嘿   嘿   嘿012---Hey, hey, hey, now.
谁也没有错  菲比  那只是个意外012---this was no one's fault, Pheebs, okay? It was an accident.
不  是我害的  你应该睡这里012---Well no, It was my fault. You should get the nice room.
好吧012---Okay. Whoo!
瑞秋   你是摩妮卡饭店的首位贵客012---So, Rach, you're the first guest at Hotel Monica.
摩妮卡饭店012---Hotel Monica.
你得告诉我早餐想吃什么蛋012---Umm, you'll just have to tell me how you like your eggs in the morning.
我打算端到床上给你012---I thought I'd bring them to you, you know, in bed.
你吃了这么多苦012---Aw. You've been through so much.
就是啊012---I have.
这是我放彼萨的地方012---This right here is where I keep the pizza.
那里  放纸巾012---And that's where the napkin is.
什么味道  就是啊  不清楚012---What's that smell? I know. I don't...
拜托  那么大一个班   你根本没有注意到我012---Oh, please, it was such a big class. You never even noticed me.
什么啊   当然有  你坐在昏昏欲睡的瞌睡虫旁边012---What? Of course I did. You sat next to Sleepy Sleeperson.
谁012---Who?
我记不住全班的名字012---Oh. I had trouble remembering everyone's names...
就取绰号代替012---...so I came up with nicknames.
像你的另一边是   臭臭冯党卫队012---Like the guy on the other side of you was Smelly von Brown-Shirt.
没错012---Oh, yeah. Ha, ha.
你给我取过绰号没有   没有012---So, um, did you have a nickname for me? Uh, no. No.
你肯定有   是什么012---Yes, you did. What was it?
嗯012---Um, it's...
可爱麦美眉012---Cutie McPretty.
哦  太可爱了012---Oh, that's so sweet.
真好  说真的  今晚真的很开心012---Listen, I gotta tell you, I'm having a great time.
你之前说师生约会很奇怪012---You know how before you said it might be weird, the whole student-teacher thing?
其实我也有同感   但结果不是这样   一点也不奇怪012---And to be frank, I thought it would be too. But it's not. I mean, it's not at all.
盖勒博士  伯特012---Dr. Geller. Burt.
你昨晚睡得好吗012---So did you sleep well last night?
很好   对啊012---I did. Yeah?
很好  摩妮卡太好了  在我枕头旁  放了一小片薄荷012---I did. Monica was so sweet. She left a little mint on my pillow.
你猜乔伊在我枕头上放了什么   什么012---Know what Joey left on my pillow?  What?
口香糖012---Gum.
找到起火原因了  我知道  是我的蜡烛害的012---Well, we determined the cause of the fire. Yeah, I know. It was my candle, my candle.
不是  浴室有个电器没拔掉012---No, there was an appliance left on in the bathroom.
好像是卷发器012---It looks like a curling iron.
我没用卷发器   那是总有人在用012---I don't use a curling iron. Well, someone does.
别看我  我的头发是直的  直的直的直的012---Well, don't look at me! my hair's straight. Straight, straight, straight.
也可能是直发夹012---It could've been a hair-straightener. Oh.
彼萨都放这里012---This is where I keep the pizza.
纸巾呢012---And-Hey, where'd the napkin go?
好了  可不能让贵客眼睛疲劳012---There you go. I wouldn't want my best guest to strain her eyes.
谢谢  摩妮卡012---Thanks, Monica.
你怕那个味道吗  什么  乔伊家的味道012---Does that smell bother you? What, the smell from Joey's?
不怕啊  这里又闻不到012---No, I can hardly smell it over here.
闻得到就说  我可以烤个派把它盖过去012---Well, you let me know if you can. Because I can bake a pie to cover it.
有点闻得到   烤个派吧  好啊012---I can smell it a little. Bake the pie. Okay.
喂012---Hello?
在  请稍候  火场调查员找你012---Oh, yes, one minute, please. It's for you. It's the fire inspector.
喂  我是菲比012---Oh. Hello? Yeah, this is Phoebe.
是吗012---Really?
是的  调查结果出来了  不是直发夹012---Yeah, so it turns out that it wasn't the hair-straightener...
引起的火灾012---...that started the fire.
不  不  是因为蜡烛012---No, no. It was the candles.
点燃蜡烛后不注意   实在太糟糕了012---Yeah. It's very not good leaving candles unattended.
消防学校最先教的事情之一就是这个012---In fact, one of the first things they teach you in fire school is--
嗯012---Uh...
好  我该挂了012---Uh, okay, well, I have to go now.
我们玩得好开心  她好棒012---We had such a great time. She's incredible.
我以为年龄会成为问题   结果不会012---I thought the age difference might be a problem, but it wasn't.
一点也不会   就她的年纪来说   伊丽莎白非常成熟012---It wasn't at all. Elizabeth is very mature for her age.
有些人就是不懂012---A concept lost on some people.
所以师生可以约会012---So it's okay to date a student?
好吧  也不全是012---Well, not really.
技术上讲呢   没触犯校规或什么的012---I mean, technically, it's not against the rules or anything.
但是会受到争议012---But it is frowned upon...
尤其是我们昨晚遇见的教授012---...especially by that professor we ran into last night.
属于自以为是的学者012---Judgy von Holier-Than-Thou.
罗斯  小心一点012---Well Ross, you be careful now. 
别被叫成爱泡麦学生教授012---You don't wanna get a reputation as y'know Professor McNails-His-Students. Ha, ha.
我该怎么办   罗斯   这很清楚啊012---Yeah. What should I do? Well, Ross, it seems pretty clear.
什么更重要   别人的看法还是你的感觉012---I mean, what's more important, what people think or how you feel? Huh?
你得忠于你的内心  乔伊   说得真好012---Ross, you gotta follow your heart. Joey, that is so sweet.
嘿   嘿   你跟黛娜谈得怎样012---Hey. Hey, hey. So how'd it go with Dana?
我星期四该不该腾出时间来012---Any reason I should leave a block of time open, say, Thursday?
我说不出口  你说不出口012---I couldn't do it. You couldn't do it?
别急  我需要更多的时间  我们晚上要吃饭012---Relax, I just need more time. We're going to dinner.
什么   你还要跟她出去012---What? You're going outwith her again?
跟谁出去   大学的黛娜基史东012---Going out with who? Dana Keystone, from college.
喔   对   她不是012---Oh, yeah. Wasn't she, uh, mm...?
不   那是黛娜卡普林012---No, that was Dana Kaplan.
哦  嗯012---Oh. Ah.
乔伊   你根本不认识她   那又怎样012---Joey, you didn't even know her. Yeah, whatever.
故事真的好棒012---Great story again.
好错综复杂012---The yarns that you weave.
我该走了  真的  我得走了012---You know, uh, actually, I should get going.
不  不  不   留下来吧012---Oh, no, no, no, stay, stay, because you should--
你该留下来012---You should stay.
我真的很受宠若惊012---Oh, I am really flattered.
只是  我对你没那种感觉012---But I just... I don't feel that way about you.
不  不  不  我不是  不是  钱德  对不起012---Oh, no, no, no. That's not-No, no, no. I'm sorry, Chandler.
你人很好   我也不想伤害你012---You know, you are such a sweet guy, and I don't wanna hurt you.
真希望我可以做点什么让你好过点012---Oh, I wish there were something I could do to make you feel better.
不  不  真的吗012---No, no, no-Really?
当然012---Of course.
我真是太伤心了  我012---Well, it just hurts so bad, I, uh...
对不起012---Oh, I'm sorry.
或许你可以做一件事   什么事   你尽管说012---Well, maybe there is one thing you can do. What? Anything. Anything.
我是刚刚才想到的012---Well, I mean, this is just off the top of my head now. Um...
我有个演员朋友012---Ahem. But I have this friend, uh, this actor friend...
他要是知道我这么做的话   一定会杀了我012---...and he would kill me if he knew that I was doing this, um...
可以的话  能不能给他一次参加你的新电影试镜的机会012---...but, um, would it be possible for him to get an audition for your movie...
比如说  星期四012---...say, on Thursday?
没问题012---Absolutely.
但是我让你的朋友来试镜012---But you'd really feel better about me rejecting you...
真的能让你好过一点012---...if your friend can audition for my movie?
这是我的心愿   再见012---Well, the heart wants what it wants. I'll see you later.
嘿  怎么样啊012---Hey. How's it going?
这5分钟都没什么太大的变化012---Well, not much has changed in the last five minutes.
其实有  我烤了饼干012---Yes, it has. I made cookies.
算了   我还在消化你做的薯片012---That's all right. I'm still full from your homemade potato chips, so...
但是饼干刚烤好   应该趁热吃012---Oh. But you should eat them now because they're hot from the oven.
好  但不能在这里吃012---Okay. Oh. But not in here.
床上不能吃饼干  记得吗  不能掉屑屑012---Can't eat them in bed, remember? No crummies.
好吧012---Oh.
好  我马上出去012---I'll be out in a second.
好吧012---0Kay.
你在干什么  门锁不起来  对吧012---What are you doing? This doesn't lock, does it'?
乔伊  对不起  没关系  别担心012---Oh. Joey, sorry. Oh. Oh, it's all right, don't worry about it.
但是你看   会留下污渍012---No, but look. Oh, that's gonna leave a stain.
瑞秋   没关系   这是乔伊家012---Rach, hey, it's fine. You're at Joey's.
真的吗  当然  你看012---Really? Yeah, look.
我没有这样吃过东西   我知道012---I've never lived like this before. I know.
好吧   别浪费了  我是说它还能吃呢012---All right, well, don't waste it. I mean, it's still food.
接下来要干嘛   要不要去喝杯酒012---What do you wanna do now, huh? You wanna go get a drink?

我以前念大学时  我们都经常012---You know, I remember when I was in college, we used to--
你干什么  没事   我只是012---What are you doing? Nothing, I'm just--
只是觉得和你在一起很舒服012---I'm so comfortable with you.
你怕被别人看见吧   什么啊012---Do you not wanna be seen with me? What?
不  当然不是  他们走了吗012---No, of course I do. Are they gone?
没有  他们还在  不过我想我该走了012---No, they're still here. But I think I'm about to leave.

你说得对   这样太蠢了  管别人怎么想012---You're right, this is stupid. Who cares what people think?
我们情投意合  对吧   这样并没有错012---I mean, we like each other, right? There's nothing wrong with that.
来吧012---Come on.

我们在约会012---And we're dating.
你们可以皱眉摇头012---And you may frown upon that...
但我们不会再躲躲藏藏的了012---...but we're not gonna hide it anymore.
你肯定会被解雇的012---You are so fired.
什么   你会被解聘012---What? They're gonna fire you.
你不能和学生约会   这违反校规012---You can't date a student. It's against the rules.
真的  不只是受到争议012---Really? It's not just frowned upon?
哦  嗯012---Oh. Ah. Ah!

嗨  嗨012---Hi. Hi.
我有事要找你012---Yeah, okay, I need to talk to you. Uh-huh.
我知道他们说直发夹是起火源012---Now, I know that they said that the hair-straightener started the fire...
但我也有责任012---...but I think I'm partly at fault.
你看嘛   我没有告诉你   我最近刚刚换过厕纸012---You see, I didn't tell you, but, um, I had recently refilled the tissues.
所以  我们得正视这个问题   那个太容易着火了012---And so, you know, let's face it, that's just kindling.
我想我还是住乔伊家比较好012---So I think it's better that I stay at Joey's.
不  不  菲比  都是我不好012---No, no, no, Phoebe, this was my fault.
而且你知道吗   我在这里感觉太好了   好吧012---Besides, you know what? I'm fine here. Okay.
钱德   摩妮卡在找你   是嘛012---Oh, Chandler, Monica's looking for you. Really?
她好像说跟饼干屑有关   不会吧   我那么小心012---Yeah, she said something about crummies. No, no, no. I was so careful.
好  你一定要跟我换  摩妮卡快把我逼疯了012---Okay. You have to switch with me. Monica is driving me crazy.
没错  小姐们都想住乔伊家012---That's right. All the ladies wanna stay at Joey's.
不要  菲比  少来啊  我不想换012---No, Phoebe, come on, I don't wanna switch.
拜托啦   我在这里可以扔湿纸巾玩012---Please. Come on, I can throw wet paper towels here.
但是在摩妮卡那边   你只可能在水槽边吃饼干012---No, but at Monica's, you can eat cookies over the sink.
我知道  对不起012---I know. I'm sorry.
好吧   算了012---All right, fine.
这个好像很好玩012---This looks like so much fun. Ha, ha.
天呐  湿答答的012---God, what a mess.
校规里真的有写啊012---Wow, it actually is in the handbook.
我不能和你约会   或是在研究室用电磁炉012---I can't date you or have a hot plate in my office.
我们居然不能再见面了012---Oh, I can't believe we have to stop seeing each other.
不管值不值得   谢谢你为我挺身而出012---For what it's worth, I did appreciate you standing up for me.
这种感觉真好012---That felt really nice.
我更喜欢你了012---Kind of made me like you even more.
我知道  我也很喜欢你  但是我们不能再继续交往了012---I know, I know. I really like you too. But we can't date.
校规明文禁止师生恋012---It's against the rules. It's forbidden.
怎么了  光听你说校规 "禁止"012---What? Just hearing you describe it...
就觉得好冲动012---...as forbidden, it's really hot.
真的012---Really?
对啊012---Yeah.
不管有多冲动   这都是错的012---Well, I don't care how hot it is, it's, uh-it's wrong.
别再说了   不  不  这是错的012---Stop it. No, no. It's wrong. it's--
这不太合适012---It's naughty.
这是012---It's...
禁忌012---...taboo.
把书关上012---Shut the book.
