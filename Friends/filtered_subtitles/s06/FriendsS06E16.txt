你准备怎么约女人呢012---I mean how-how are you gonna start to find...
我把可能有兴趣的女人  都列了出来012---Actually, I'm making a list of women I know who might be into this.
哇012---Oh. Wow.

但是她好棒012---...but she is so...
我知道012---Oh, I know. Ha, ha.
光嘴上说说   就让我有点蠢蠢欲动012---You know, just-just talking about it is getting me kind of...
看得出来  我也是012---I know. Me too. Yeah?
是吗  我想班已经睡了012---Well, I think Ben's asleep.
哇 啊哦012---Oh, um...
我觉得我们最好储存精力012---You know, I think it'll be better if we just save it.

她还不知道她被开除了对吧  对  医生说她会没命012---She doesn't know she was fired yet, does she? No, the doctors say it may kill her.
你们两个女生在窃窃私语什么啊012---What are you two girls whispering about over there?
不过  我觉得应该告诉她012---But I think we should tell her.

所以我要喝012---Oh. So I Will! Ha.
感觉好像下雨啊   很酷吧012---It's like it's raining. Pretty cool, huh?
要是你以为把鱼扔进去   不会卡进机器里012---But if you thinking you can put a fish in there and it wouldn't get sucked into the mechanism...
那你就错了012---...well, you'd be wrong.
可以借用洗手间吗012---Um, can I use your bathroom?
就在那里面012---It's, uh, right through there. Okay. Ah.
我给你说吧012---God  y'know, I gotta tell you.
要是一个星期前有人对我说012---If someone told me a week ago...
我会在乔伊崔比亚尼家撒尿012---...that I would be peeing in Joey Tribbiani's apartment
人生真美妙啊   对吧012---Life's pretty great, isn't it?
希望你饿了012---I hope you're hungry.
我们先吃生蚝012---We're starting with oysters.
你知道生蚝的作用吧012---And y'know  what they say about oysters, don't you?
它有寄生虫012---They have parasites?

我可以让你感受到他的存在012---Well, I could make it seem like he's here.
关于库司库司的小常识012---"Here's some little-known facts about cous-cous:
第二个库司  是1979年才加的012---They didn't add the second 'cous' until 1979."
别闹了  一点也不好笑012---Stop it! That's not funny! Okay.
好  对不起012---I'm sorry, okay? It's just...
今晚原本应该很重要的012---...tonight was supposed to be, you know, it was supposed to be a big deal.

等待完美的对象012---Waiting for the perfect guy.
很好  这样很好啊  你真的觉得罗杰是那个人012---Well, good. Good for you. You really think Roger's the perfect guy?
不是  但他也不算太糟啊012---No, but he's not a horrible guy.
我也都那样自我介绍的012---That's what I tell girls about me.
钱德   我会死于处女之身012---Chandler, I'm gonna die a virgin!

你怎么分辨雷莫瑞医生012---How do you know where Dr. Drake Ramoray leaves off...
跟乔伊崔比亚尼的转换012---...and Joey Tribbiani begins?
雷莫瑞医生012---Well, with Dr. Drake...
有现成的台词可说012---...they always tell me what to say.
乔伊就得自己办了012---And with Joey, I pretty much have to make it up on my own.
你告诉我  乔伊012---Tell me something Joey. Whoa!
我刚刚从沙发上摔下来   没错012---I just fell right off the couch there. Yeah, you did.
我没事012---I'm okay.
坐好了  我问你一件事  好012---Here you go. Let me ask you a question. Whoops. Yeah.
上次有人012---When was the last time...
称赞你很美丽   是什么时候012---...someone told you just how beautiful you are?
我的手麻了012---I can't feel my hands.
手给我012---Come on. Come here.
我们不能这么做  没错012---We can't do this. No!
吃生蚝   好012---Oyster? Yeah.
要是我们做了  我压力会很大012---If-If! If we did do this, there'd be a lot of pressure on me.
因为你等了很久  我不想让你失望012---y’know? Because you've been waiting a very long time, and I wouldn't want to disappoint you.
但是我没得比较012---Yeah but see I have nothing to compare it to.
就算你很差劲   我哪会知道啊012---So even if you were horrible, how would I know?
我做这个好啊012---I do like that.
我还比较累  我得跟另外四个女人比012---It's harder for me. I have four other women to compete with.
其实  只有三个012---Well, if it helps, there were only three.
所以只有今晚  对吧012---So it'd just be for tonight?
没错   只是朋友在帮朋友的忙012---Absolutely. It would just be one friend helping out another friend.
别说了  我们不能这样做012---Stop it. We're not doing this.
做吧  不行012---Let's do it! No!
好吧  好吧012---"Okay! "Okay!
那012---So, um...
你知道步骤吗012---Do you have any, uh, moves?
知道一些012---I have some moves.
我就不知道  好012---I have no moves. Okay.
你在干什么012---Oh, okay, what you doing there?
对不起  真的太奇怪了  是啊  还是算了012---Oh y'know what? I'm sorry, this is just too weird. Yeah, forget it.

我们一定要再来一次012---We are gonna do that again!
没问题012---Ah! Okay.
早安012---Morning.
对喔  没错012---Oh, right. Yeah.
天哪012---Oh, God.
居然让乔伊崔比亚尼  听到我吐012---Oh, I can't believe Joey Tribbiani heard me throw up.
其实他也看到了一点012---He actually saw you a little bit too.
不会吧012---No.
天哪  我们没有012---Oh, God, we-We didn't, uh...?
没有  没有012---No. No. no.
看完就没兴致了012---Not after seeing that.
天啊  我真的是很糟糕012---God, I'm just a horrible person.
为什么  因为我已经结婚了012---Well, why? Because I'm married.
没错  我是有夫之妇012---That's right, I'm a married woman.
还跑到一个电视明星家搞外遇012---I came to a TV star's apartment to have an affair. Ugh!
别傻了012---That's ridiculous.
我才不是明星012---I'm not a "star."
只是一般的名演员012---I'm just a regular famous actor.
而我是一个很糟糕的人012---And I'm a horrible, horrible person.
瑞秋  你别再自责了012---Rachel, will you stop saying that?
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey, look.
你记不记得在节目中  卡普丽临死前012---Remember on the show when Capri was dying?
给了我  石洞里的戒指  记得012---And she gave me-- The ring from the cave. Yeah.
好012---Uh, okay, well...
天哪  他们能让你留着它012---Oh, my God! They let you keep that stuff?
当然  只要不被发现  想留什么都行012---Sure. As long as they don't find out, you can keep whatever you want.
我要把它送给你012---And I want you to have it.
不  不要  要012---No, I couldn't. Yes. Yes.
我让你每次看到它012---And every time you look at it...
就是要记住你是个好人012---...I want you to remember that you are a good person.
你有机会外遇012---Okay, you've had the chance to cheat...
而且还是跟我012---...and with me.
但是你没有  这就是这枚戒指的意义012---But you didn't. And that's what this ring stands for.
我以为它是代表  卡普丽对哥哥永不止息的爱012---But I thought that ring stood for Capri's undying love for her brother.
你到底要不要  我要012---Look, you want the ring or not? Yeah!
嘿  看看你  你醒了012---Hey, look at you! You're up!
太好了  我想出去走一走012---All right. I thought I'd try to take a walk.
你们帮我倒杯水  我马上回来012---You pour me some water. I'll be back soon.
你不是想打公共电话回公司吧012---Whoa, whoa. You're not gonna use the pay phone to call work, are you?
不是  我已经学到教训了012---No. I've learned my lesson.
快点  动作快012---Let's go. Come on. Move it.
菲比  快012---Phoebe, come on!
鞋子  公文包  谢了  祝你的胆囊早日康复012---Shoes, briefcase. Thanks, Lou. Good luck with the gallbladder.
嘿  乔伊012---Hey, Joe...
你玩过3P吗012---...did you ever have a threesome?
罗斯  我觉得卡萝很漂亮  我也相信你很有魅力  但是012---Well uh, look Ross. I think Carol's great, and I'm sure you're a very attractive man, but...
不是  我012---No, I--
我之所以问你是因为012---No. The reason I'm asking is that...
我昨晚玩了3P012---...I sort of had one last night.
你  对啊012---You? Yeah.
哇啊  漂亮012---Wow. All right. Yeah.
还  过瘾吗012---So? Was it amazing?
还好啦012---It was, heh...
还好012---okay.
只有还好  你的玩法对吗012---Just okay? Did you do it right?
你有没有在参加派对时觉得012---Look, it's just, did you ever go to a party and think:
"少了我  会有什么差别吗"012---"Would anyone really miss me if I weren't here?"
不过  罗斯012---But still, Ross.
跟两个女人玩得再难玩  也胜过其他日子012---Your worst day with two women, pretty much better than any other day.
你懂吧  那当然012---Oh, oh, no, absolutely.
对  对012---Yeah. Yeah.
只是012---It's just...
我这个部分很快就结束了012---...my part seemed to be over pretty quickly...
然后我就一直等012---...and then there was a lot of waiting around.
你两个都有做到吧012---But you got to be with both of them, right?
没有012---Not really.
我只有跟卡萝做012---Eh, just Carol.
另一个没做  没有  她直接就把我踹开了012---Not the other one? No, she kept kicking me away.
那样很讨厌  就是啊012---You don't want that. No.
不过至少你开了眼界012---Well hey, at least you got to see a lot of stuff.
是大大的开了眼界012---Oh, I saw a lot of stuff.
你后来有点无聊  有一点012---You get a little bored? A little.
我弄了点吃的  是吗012---Yeah. Made a snack. Yeah?
你弄了什么  就是三明治012---What'd you have? Just a sandwich.
火鸡肉  加一点芥末酱012---Turkey. A little mustard.
好像很赞  是很赞012---Sounds good. It really was.
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
跟你说  我昨晚跟一个女生到达本垒了012---Let me tell you about this chick I scored with last night.
等等  就是你嘛012---Oh, no, wait a minute, that was you. Heh.
你看我  我是个堕落的女人012---Hey, check me out. I'm a slut!
晚上要不要找点事情做012---So you, uh, want to do something tonight?
不行  罗杰医生又要来了012---Oh, I can't. Dr. Roger's coming over again.
也对012---Oh. Oh, right. Right.
因为你还在跟他交往  他人很好012---Because you're still seeing him, and, uh, he's a good guy.
我记得有一次012---I remember a time...
你还好吧  好得很012---Are you okay? Yeah, totally.
好得很  你呢012---Totally. Are you?
棒呆了  真的好神奇012---Great. It's so amazing.
上次罗杰来的时候  我好紧张012---Y'know, Last time Dr. Roger came over, I was so nervous.
但是跟你过后  我变成了  "医生可以来看我了吗"012---But after being with you, I'm like, "Can the doctor see me now?"
一定可以012---I'll bet he can.
我虽然没有预约  但是我需要你来体检012---"I don't have an appointment, but I sure could use a physical." Ha, ha.
你真的没事  没事  别管我  我很好012---You sure you're okay? Oh yeah! Yeah! Don't worry about me, I'll be fine.
天哪  巴瑞012---My God! Barry!

菲比  你不是被开除了吗012---Pheebs, uh, didn't you get fired?
我可不这么认为012---Heh, I don't think so.
菲比  杰克  嘿012---Phoebe? Jack! Hey. Ha,ha.
你来干什么  我好多了  回来上班012---What are you doing here? All better. Back to work.
但这个研究部猪头说我被开除了012---Except this clown from research told me I was fired.
他应该用功一点012---He should do his research, huh? Ha-ha-ha.
你是被开除了012---Well, you were fired.
没有012---Nuh-uh.
我跟帮你接电话的人说了012---I told that guy who answered your phone.
喔  我没收到留言  所以不算012---Oh, okay. I didn't get that message. So this doesn't count.
那我先进办公室了012---Anyway, I'll be in my office. Ah, heh.
菲比  你没有办公室了012---Phoebe, you don't have an office.
没关系  我在这里工作012---All right, I'll work right here.
这里很好  旁边有植物012---This is good. Next to this plant.
菲比  你闯入我的办公室了012---Phoebe, let's-- You're in my office.
我替这家公司赚了很多钱  而且是大钱012---Look, I've made a lot of cash for this company. I am talking big bucks!
披索  日圆  卢布  我才犯了一个小错012---Pesos! Yen! Rubles! You make one little mistake--
你损失了1千3百万元012---You lost 13 million dollars.
原来一切都是为了钱012---So now this is all about money?
我已经够012---You know, it's bad enough that-- Ow!
别闹了吧012---Oh, you have got to be kidding.
你还好吗  我心脏病又发作了012---Are you all right? I'm having another heart attack.
什么   我的心脏病又发作了012---What? I'm having another heart attack!
叫救护车012---Call 911!
猪头012---Dumb-ass!
菲比  你好吗012---Pheebs, how's it going?
我被开除  心脏病发作012---They fired me, and I'm having a heart attack.
欢迎归队  好012---Well, welcome back. Yeah.
嗨  罗斯  嗨  瑞秋012---Hi, Ross. Hi, Rachel.
乔伊崔比亚尼在吗  不在012---Is Joey Tribbiani here? Um, no.
如果你见到他  请转告他我在找他012---Well, if you see him, will you please tell him that I'm looking for him...
这一次  我不会吐了012---...and that this time I am not gonna throw up!
你还好吗  我  我很好啊012---Are you okay? Me? I'm great!
我很好  我好的不得了012---I'm fine! I'm so good.
但是你知道  谁不好吗012---But you know who's not great?
男人012---Men!
你是男人  对吧  罗斯  对012---You're a man, right, Ross? Yeah.
坐下  好012---Sit down. Okay.
我问你一件事012---Let me, uh, ask you something.
婚誓对你们来说是个屁吗012---Do wedding vows mean squat to you people?
为什么我们一说要出门012---And why is it that the second we tell you we're going out of town...
砰  你们就跟邻居的遛狗小妹上床012---...bam, there you are in bed with the neighbor's dog-walker?
我们很抱歉012---We're sorry.
我说真的  婚姻的神圣性呢012---No, seriously. Seriously. What has happened to the sanctity of marriage?
你昨晚不是跟乔伊在一起  你是侦探吗012---Didn't you spend last night at Joey's? Oh, what are you, a detective?
我不知道你和你丈夫怎么了012---I don't know what's going on with you and your husband...
希望那位遛狗妹已经成年012---...and what is hopefully an adult dog-walker.
但我要说  男人并非都是那样012---Look, can I just say, not all men are like that.
有些男人012---Ugh. Hey, there are some men...
愿意尽全力挽回婚姻012---...who'll do whatever to make their marriage work.
有些男人愿意退到一边012---There are some men who will stand by and watch...
看老婆跟健身房刚认识的女人打得火热012---...as their wives engage in what can only be described as a "twosome"...
旁若无人012---...with some woman she barely knows from the gym!
这些男人是谁012---Who are these men?
就是我认识的一个人012---Just men. A guy I know.
你可能要告诉他  听起来他的老婆012---Well, you might want to tell him it sounds like his wife...
像是同性恋012---...is gay.
她才不是012---She is not...
她是同性恋012---She's gay-
天哪012---Oh, my God.
她好同性恋啊012---She is so gay!
我真不敢相信012---I can't believe this.
已婚者的黄道吉日012---Good day for married people, huh?
很遗憾你老公不忠012---I'm sorry your husband cheated on you.
很遗憾你老婆是同性恋012---I'm sorry your wife is gay.
看来女人也没那么好  去告诉我老婆啊012---I guess women aren't that great either. Try telling my wife that.
我可以进来吗  进来  吃饭  随你便012---Okay to come in? Yeah, come in, eat, whatever you want.
罗杰医生又被叫走了012---Dr. Roger got beeped again.
我知道  你猜是谁叫走他的012---Yeah, I know. Guess who beeped him?
