嘿  瑞秋  我只是过来012---Oh. Uh, hey, Rach. I was just coming over here to, uh...
等等  我没必要向你撒谎  你都搬走了012---Oh, wait, I don't have to lie to you, you don't live here anymore.
我在吃他们的东西  你呢012---I'm eating their food. What are you doing?
罗斯跟我妹约会012---Ross is on a date with my sister.
窗帘已经拉上2个半小时了012---They shut the drapes two and a half hours ago.
我们能跟你妹妹约会吗012---Whoa, I didn't know we could date your sister.
乔伊  我们知道你在偷东西吃012---Joey, we know you steal our food.
不用了012---I'm good.
窗帘还没拉开012---Oh, are the drapes still closed hon?
对  其实隔开两户的变态老夫妇  才应该拉上窗帘的012---Yeah. And y'know who should've shut their drapes is that perverted couple two doors over.
那是秋千吗  不要问012---Is that a swing? Oh, don't even ask.
罗斯居然跟瑞秋的妹妹约会012---I can't believe Ross is going out with Rachel's sister.
钱德跟我妹亲热   我气了他10年012---When Chandler made out with my sister, I was mad at him for 1O years.
那是5年前的事  对  你还剩5年012---That was like five years ago. Yeah, you got five years left.
乔伊  你想再加1年吗012---Joey-You wanna make it six?
老友记  第六季  第14集  谁是AV女优012---Friends  S06E14  The One Where Chandler Can't Cry
罗斯  你好吗  你在这里012---Oh, Ross, hey. Hi, how are you? There you are.
嘿012---Hey.
一杯咖啡012---Can I get a cup of coffee?
昨晚的约会怎样啊012---So how was your big date last night?
还不错  很开心012---Uh, it was okay. Yeah, it was fun.
是吗  对啊012---It was fun? Yeah.
太好了012---Great.
所以  你们合得来吗012---So, uh... So did you guys hit it off?
应该吧  所以  那后来你们又怎么样嘛012---I guess so. So, uh... So did anything happen?
听说你们把窗帘拉上了012---Because rumor has it you guys shut the drapes. Heh.
不  不  我们没怎么样012---No, no, nothing happened.
我是要放映我最爱的化石幻灯片012---I shut the drapes to show her slides of my favorite fossils.
幻灯片啊012---Oh, slides. Ha, ha.
所以你们真的没怎么样012---So really nothing happened.
我们可以有怎么样  对了  她很喜欢我的幻灯片012---Something could've happened, all right? She really dug my slides.
而且她绝对对我有放电012---Mm. And she was definitely giving me the vibe.
是 "别再给我看三叶虫照片" 的电吗012---Was it the "Please don't show me another picture of a trilobite" vibe?
总之012---Anyway...
要是她不喜欢我   为什么要再约我012---If she wasn't into me, why would she ask me out again?
她又约你了  对啊012---She asked you out again? Yeah, uh-huh.
明天晚上012---Tomorrow night. Hmm.
一年之中最浪漫的日子  情人节012---Valentine's Day. The most romantic day of the year.
谁知道会怎样012---Who knows what could happen?
到时候我拉上窗帘   或许就不是要放幻灯片了  你懂吧012---I might not be shutting my drapes to show her my slides, if you know what--
当然   我懂  我懂了012---Okay, okay, okay, I got it, I got it.
我不能接受你跟我妹交往012---I can't-I can't go with the you-and-my-sister thing.
我就是不能  那样太奇怪了  好吗012---I just can't. It's just too weird, all right?
一想到你们在一起  我就抓狂012---I imagine the two of you together, I freak out.
我会疯掉的  我受不了  我受不了  好了  好了  别激动012---It just freaks me out, and I can't do it. Okay, okay, okay. No-Yes. It's okay.
没事的012---It's okay.
如果你受不了  我就不再见她012---Hey, it's too weird for you. I won't see her again.
谢谢你  我是说过了明晚之后012---Thank you. I-Yeah. I mean, after tomorrow night.
不不不  求求你  罗斯  我受不了  我真的会捉狂的012---No, no, no. Please, Ross. I can't do it. It's gonna freak me out.
好吧  好吧012---Okay, okay, okay.
好  我今晚就告诉她  我不能再跟她见面了012---Okay. I'll tell her tonight I can't see her anymore.
罗斯  谢谢012---Ross, thanks.
你要我现在打给她吗  不  不用012---You want me to call her right now? Oh, no. No, no, no.
那样太夸张了012---I mean, come on, that's craz-I mean, that's crazy.
怎样啊  你最近在干嘛012---So, what's going on with you? What is going on with you?
这个嘛012---Well, um... Oh.
我这学期可能会再开一堂课  好啊  现在就打给她012---I may teach another class this semester. Yeah, do it now. Call her right now.
我最喜欢这段了  我也是012---This is my favorite part. Yeah, me too.
你们知道什么更催泪  《小鹿斑比》012---Oh, you know what's sadder than this? Bambi.
那部片让我哭了3天  不  是2天012---I cried for three days with that movie. No, wait, two.
第三天我妈自杀了  我也在哭那件事012---Because on the third day, my mother killed herself, so I was partly crying for that.
为了那个哭我可以了解   但是《小鹿斑比》是卡通片啊012---Well, see, now, that I can see crying over, but Bambi is a cartoon.
斑比的母亲死了  你没哭012---You didn't cry when Bambi's mother died?
对啊  动画师不再画母鹿了  的确很可怜012---Yes, it was very sad when the guy stopped drawing the deer.
钱德   哭没什么不对  你不必老是那么男子汉012---Chandler, There's nothing wrong with crying. You don't have to be so macho all the time.
我哪有男子汉啊012---I'm not macho.
也对012---Yeah, you're right.
我不知道我在想什么012---I don't know what I was thinking.
反正我就是没哭过   我不是那种会哭的人012---I guess I just never really cried, you know? I'm not a crying kind of guy.
少来啊   你总会遇见令你鼻酸的事012---Come on, man, there's gotta be something that gets you choked up.
像012---Like, uh...
如果你看到一只三脚小狗呢012---What if you saw a three-legged puppy?
我是会难过   但是不会哭012---I'd be sad, sure, but I wouldn't cry.
要是那只小狗说  "钱德救救我012---Okay, what if the puppy said, "Help me, Chandler.
其他的狗狗都欺负我"012---All the other puppies pick on me."
哭啊  我发现了一只会说话的狗   我发了012---Cry? I just found a talking puppy. I'm rich.
我知道了  你小时候的照片012---Oh. I've got it. I have got it. Pictures from your childhood.
你看了一定会哭012---This will get you going good.
那张是什么  那是年级的家长会012---All right, what's going on there? Oh, that's Parents' Day, first grade.
我和校工马丁的合影012---That's me with the janitor, Martin.
你爸妈呢   他们不想去012---Where are your parents? Oh, they didn't wanna come.
钱德  好可怜啊012---Oh, Chandler. You poor thing.
这件事不会让你哭吗012---So that story doesn't make you cry?
不会  我就是不会哭  这没什么  好吗012---No. Look, I don't cry. It's not a big deal, okay?
不  不好  一点也不好012---No. It's not okay. It's not okay at all.
你的心是死的012---You're dead inside.
请问一下  什么事012---Excuse me. Yeah?
你是菲比布非吗   是我012---Are you Phoebe Buffay? Yeah.
可以帮我签名吗   我是你的超级粉丝012---Can I get your autograph? I'm your biggest fan.
你是我的超级粉丝  我一直想认识你   你好012---Oh, you're my biggest fan? I've always wanted to meet you. Hi. Ha, ha.
没问题012---Sure, yeah. Wow.
谢谢你012---Wow, thanks a lot.
我只想说  你真的很有天分012---I just wanna say I think you're really talented.
你是因为崇拜我才这么说的012---You're just saying that because you're my biggest fan.
乔伊   好好招呼那个人  他是个影迷012---Joey, listen, take good care of that guy. okay? He's a fan.
再见012---Bye.
你看过我演的《我们的日子》012---So you saw me on Days of Our Lives, huh?
要我来一段  德瑞克雷莫瑞医生吗012---Want me to, want me to do a little Dr. Drake Ramoray for you?
我不知道你在说什么012---I have no idea what you're talking about.
不过我刚拿到菲比布非的签名012---But I just got Phoebe Buffay's autograph.
你是菲比的影迷  没错  她的电影我都看过012---Oh. You're Phoebe's fan. Oh, yeah. I've seen all her movies.
电影  那是菲比布非  AV巨星012---Movies? That was Phoebe Buffay, the porn star.
不是吧  不  不  是她012---I don't think so. No, no, it was.
她演过《性玩具总动员》012---She was in Sex Toy Story 2...
《女人国的劳伦斯》012---...Lawrence of a Labia.
而我拿到了她的签名012---And I got her autograph.
漫画店的人一定不会相信012---The guys at the comic-book store aren't gonna believe this.
阿甘012---Gunther.
以后别让那个人进来   他说菲比是AV巨星012---Hey, don't let that guy in here anymore. He just said Phoebe's a porn star.
说巨星有点夸张了  不过她真的很猛012---Well, I wouldn't call her a star, but she's really good.
你应该去看《G歪神探》012---You should check out Inspect Her Gadget.
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
说了你一定不信012---You'll never believe what just happened.
罗斯刚刚回绝我  又没说原因012---Ross totally blew me off and didn't even tell me why.
这个嘛  你知道吗012---Oh, well. You know what, honey?
忘掉一个男人最好的办法   就是跟其他人交往012---The best thing to do to get over a guy is to start dating someone else.
我们公司有个鲍伯  你一定喜欢012---Oh. Oh, there is this great guy you will just love at work named Bob.
他是人力资源部的明日之星012---He's a real up-and-comer in Human Resources.
谢谢你替我打气   但我不想随便跟某个阿猫阿狗交往012---Y'know, thanks for trying to cheer me up, but I’m not gonna date some random guy from your work.
不是阿猫阿狗  是鲍伯012---Not random. Bob.
可能是因为我不够成熟  不够聪明012---It's probably because I'm not mature enough or smart enough.
或许他不喜欢我的打扮012---Maybe he doesn't like the way I dress.
不可能的   一定是我不够聪明012---No, that can't be it. It's really gotta be the smart thing. Ugh.
我好笨012---I'm so stupid.
我是个美得冒泡的笨女人012---I'm just this, like, incredibly pretty, stupid girl.
不是012---No, honey.
好吧012---0Kay.
你知道罗斯为何取消约会012---Okay. You wanna know why Ross canceled the date?
是我要求的012---Because I asked him to.
你要求的   嗯嗯012---You asked him to? Mm-hm.
为什么   因为你是我妹妹012---Why? Because you are my sister...
而罗斯和我有一大段爱的渊源012---...and Ross and I have this huge history.
我不懂   你想跟罗斯交往吗  不想012---I don't understand, do you want to go out with Ross? No.
你不要他  又不要我拥有他012---You don't want him, but you don't want me to have him?
人力资源部的鲍伯012---You know, Bob in Human Resources... Ugh.
你居然这样对我   你害的我怀疑我的智商012---I cannot believe you did this to me. You had me doubting how smart I was.
你害的我怀疑我的穿着品味012---You had me doubting my fashion sense.
这又不是什么大事  我只是叫你不要跟罗斯约会012---This is not that big a deal. You just don't date Ross.
世上的男人那么多  你没有资格教我做什么012---There's a million other guys out there. Hey! You have no right to tell me what to do.
我不是在教你做   我是在教你不要做012---I'm not telling you what to do. I am telling you what not to do.
你为什么老是这么嫉妒我   不是我嫉妒你012---Why are you always so jealous of me? This is not about me being jealous of you.
是你太任性  不能吃还想吃012---This is about you being a brat, wanting what you can't have.
不能吃012---Can't have?
很抱歉   我不能吃的东西只有乳制品012---Excuse me, the only thing I can't have is dairy.
好  你和鲍伯的事吹了012---All right, all right. You just blew your chances at dating Bob.
谁  人力资源部的啦012---Who? In Human Resources!
我嫉妒她012---I am jealous of her?
她以为她是谁  卡洛琳公主吗012---I mean, who does she think she is, Princess Caroline?
你嫉妒卡洛琳公主  我有自己的城堡吗012---You're jealous of Princess Caroline? Do I have my own castle?
嘿   菲比不在吧012---Hey. Phoebe's not here, is she?
不在  真好  你们租了片子012---No. Oh, great, did you get a movie?
嗯012---Uh...
耶012---Yeah. Yeah.
但是  我想你们应该不会喜欢吧012---But, uh, I don't think it's the kind you're gonna like.
你该不会又租那种  整夜消耗纸巾的片子吧012---You didn't get more movies that are gonna have us reaching for the tissues all night, did you?
也可以这么说012---Sort of.
到底怎么了012---Guys, what's going on?
菲比是AV女优012---Phoebe's a porn star.
什么  对012---What? Yeah.
你在说什么啊   哪里有012---What are you talking about? Where?
"菲比布非之《魔法欲女》"012---"Phoebe Buffay in Buffay the Vampire Layer."
天哪  这是菲比  你在哪里租的012---Oh, my God. Ha, ha. That's Phoebe. Where did you get that?
布里克街的成人录影店012---Down at the adult video place on Bleecker.
我看到乔伊正要进去  就先跑进去012---And I saw Joey was about to go in, so I ran in ahead of him...
准备吓他012---...to surprise him.
然后我又假装不知道他也在012---And then-Ha, ha. Then I pretended that I didn't know he was in there.
天哪  我真是不敢相信012---Wow. I mean, I just can't-I can't believe this.
真是知人知面不知心啊012---You know? I mean, you think you know someone.
虽然菲比一直是个问号012---even, Even Phoebe, who's always been somewhat of a question mark.
好诡异啊012---This is so bizarre.
不过  毕竟她的童年那么悲惨012---I guess it kind of makes sense, though. She had such a terrible childhood.
我童年悲惨也没去拍A片啊012---Hey, I had a terrible childhood and I don't do porn.
对  但是你的心死了012---Yes, but you're dead inside. Ah.
好吧  我还是拿去还了吧  什么  为什么012---All right, well, I'd better take that back. What? Why? Why?
我们不能看  那是菲比演的012---We can't watch that. I mean, that's Phoebe.
你说得对  我们不该看  没错  拿去还012---Yeah you’re right, We shouldn't watch this. Absolutely not. That goes back.
看一点好了  就看前半段012---But, you know, maybe a little bit. How about just the first half?
嘿  这样不对啊   菲比是我们的朋友012---Hey, no, this is wrong, you guys. Phoebe's our friend.
我不看   没错012---I'm not gonna watch it. Yeah.
有义气   乔伊  对012---Good for you, Joe. Yeah.
我就知道你在这里  纳斯佛拉吐012---Ah. I thought I'd find you here, Nosferatool.
布非  你要把你的尖棍   深深插进我的体内吗012---Buffay, are you going to plunge your stake into my dark places?
其实  我有点希望是你来插我012---Actually, I was kind of hoping it would be the other way around.
等等  她的脚踝上是什么  你在看她的脚踝012---Hold on, what is that on her ankle? Her ankle is what you're watching?
很难看得出来012---Well, it's hard to tell. Ooh.
她能不能不要动了012---Oh, God, if she would just stop moving.
她只是在尽本分012---She's just doing her job.
你们这些变态012---You sick bastards.
是刺青  怪了  菲比可没有012---Oh. It's a tattoo. That's weird. Phoebe doesn't--
等等   那是乌苏拉  不是菲比  是乌苏拉012---Wait, that's Ursula. That's not Phoebe. That is Ursula.
等等  我可以看了  快倒带012---Wait, wait. I can watch that. Rewind it. Rewind it.
嘿  哇哦012---Hey. Oh.
你们在干麻  天哪  我在干什么012---What's up? Oh, my God. What am I doing?!
亲爱的  嘿012---Hey, sweetie. Hey.
《心灵鸡汤》012---Chicken Soup for the Soul?
这张沙发背后是空的012---There's no back to this couch.
你看它干嘛  你不是讨厌这种书嘛012---Why are you reading this? You hate this kind of stuff.
我想试试看012---Yeah I know, but I figured a shot y'know? 
也许有某个故事会让我哭012---Maybe one of those stories would make me cry.
你就不会觉得我的心死了012---Then you wouldn't think I was all dead inside.
你真有心012---Aw, that's so sweet.
钱德  你不会哭也无所谓  我爱你012---Chandler, I don't care if you can't cry. I love you.
这话温暖了我空空如也的胸口012---Oh, that makes me feel so warm in my hollow tin chest.
别闹了  拜托  你想嘛012---Stop it. I mean, come on, seriously. Think about it.
哪天我们结婚了  来到神父面前  我却是这样012---We get married, I'm up at the altar, and I'm like this:
我不在乎012---I won't care.
因为我知道你内心充满喜悦012---Because I know that you'll be feeling it all in here.
是吗  当然012---Yeah? Yeah.
要是有一天我们生小孩012---And if we have a baby one day...
医生在产房把宝宝交给你012---...and the doctor hands it to you in the delivery room...
而你没有哭   那又怎样012---...and you don't cry, so what?
要是我们送他去念大学  然后回家012---And if we take him to college and we come home...
第一次看到他的空房012---...and we see his empty room for the first time...
而你却没反应012---...and you got nothing?
我也不在意012---Won't matter to me.
好012---0Kay.
那我就不那么担心了012---Well, I won't worry about this anymore, then.
那么  如果要是我死了012---Yeah. And, you know, if I die...
久病弃世012---...from a long illness...
你在写哀悼词012---...and you're writing out my eulogy...
然后打开抽屉  看到我留了一张字条写道012---...and you open the desk drawer and find a note from me that says:
"我会永远与你同在"012---"I will always be with you"...
而你还是挤不出一滴眼泪012---...and you still can't shed one tiny tear...
我会知道  你的心早已泪流成河012---...I know you'll be crying a river inside.
我真爱你  怎么搞的012---Aw, I love you, sweet-What is wrong with you?
什么  什么012---What? What?
你居然无法为亡妻流一滴眼泪012---You can't shed a tear for your dead wife?
我死后留了字条给你012---I mean, I left you a note from the beyond.
所以刚才都不是真心话   废话  死机器人012---So you didn't mean any of that? No, you robot!
死小孩  再乱按电铃  我就012---You damn kids. You ring my bell one more time, I swear to--
吉儿012---Oh, uh, Jill. Um...
我在跟走廊那头的小朋友玩012---That's just a little game I play with the kids down the hall.
他们越来越喜欢我了012---They've really taken a liking to me.
有什么事吗012---What's the matter?
瑞秋和我大吵了一架   我可以进去吗012---Rachel and I had a really big fight. Can I come in?
我知道我们不能再见面   我也可以接受012---I know we're not supposed to see each other anymore. I'm okay with that.
只是我人生地不熟  又很需要找个人谈一谈012---I don't know anybody in the city, and I need somebody to talk to about it.
好啊  怎么了  我不想谈012---Oh, of course. What happened? I don't wanna talk about it.
好012---Okay. Um...
不过有一件事会让我比较开心   什么事012---But you know what might really cheer me up? What?
再多看几张你的超酷幻灯片012---Seeing some more of your super-cool slides.
真的吗   绝对的  我爱死了012---Wow, really? Totally. I loved them.
你还可以继续讲解  那几种不同的沙子012---And maybe you could finish telling me about all the different kinds of sand.
没问题  你等一下  我去拿投影机和讲义012---I'd love to. You wait right here. I'll go get the projector and my notes.
太好了  谢谢你  你真是个好朋友012---Oh, great. Thanks, Ross. You're such a good friend.
哇啊012---Oh.
嘿  你们有看到吉儿吗   我到处都找不到她012---Hey. Have you guys seen Jill? I can't find her anywhere.
没看到   在罗斯家吗012---No, I haven't. ls Ross home?
我打过去问他好了012---Maybe I'll just call him and see if he's actually seen her.
哪一位012---Who is it?
是菲比   "菲比"012---It's Phoebe, "Phoebe."
嘿  天哪012---Hey. Oh, God.
所以你在拍A片  没有  我没有啊012---So you're making porn movies. No, I'm not.
摄影机还在拍012---We're still rolling.
你现在就在拍012---You're making one right now.
菲比  快点  而且还用我的名字012---Let's go, Phoebe. And you're using my name.
对  有什么事吗012---Yeah, can I help you with something?
菲比  快点012---Phoebe, come on.
我在跟别人说话   你是在叫她012---Look, I'm talking right now. You're-You mean her. Oh.
双胞胎的题材一向很卖012---You know, twin stuff is always a real big seller.
什么012---What?
我可以帮你谈到30块钱012---Yeah. I could talk them into giving you like $30.
不要  想都别想012---No. No way. No.
别再冒用我的名字  你真丢脸012---And stop using my name. And shame on you.
你们真丢脸   恶心死了012---And shame on all of you. You're disgusting.
尤其是你那个样子012---Especially you, with that.
幻灯片快好了012---Slides are almost ready.
好  我知道还少了什么012---Yeah. Ooh, I know what this is missing.
酒012---Alcohol.
好  厨房有红酒  太好了012---Okay, well, there's wine in the kitchen. Oh, great.
哈罗012---Hello?
我妹妹为什么在你家   窗帘为什么拉上了012---What is my sister doing there, and why are the drapes shut?
好  你别激动012---Okay. Rash, calm down, okay?
她心情很差   我们只是在聊天012---She's really upset. We're just talking.
罗斯  她想借此跟你发生关系   来报复我012---I think she's trying to make something happen with you to get back at me.
所以她来  只是为了这个012---Oh, so that's the only reason she could be here, huh?
会不会是因为我很善于倾听012---It couldn't have anything to do with the fact that I'm a good listener...
而且放的幻灯片又很好看呢012---...and I put on a great slide show?
罗斯  是真的  她在利用你来报复我012---Ross, I am telling you, she is using you to get back at me.
我自己可以应付  回头再聊  再见012---You know, I think I can take care of myself. I'll talk to you later. Goodbye.
是你姐姐打来的012---Uh, that was your sister, actually.
她觉得你在利用我012---She thinks you're just using me. Heh.
所以呢012---So?
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
我刚去过了乌苏拉的公司012---So I just came from the company Ursula works for.
连你  你也下海了012---Oh, no, not you too.
不  我是去领菲比布非的支票012---No, no. I went to pick up Phoebe Buffay's checks.
有很多张啊012---There were a lot of them.
漂亮012---Nice. Mm-hm.
而且我以后不必再去了012---And I won't have to go back there anymore...
我留了我的 "正确" 地址012---...because I gave them my "correct address."
太好了  但别人还是会误会   你不会困扰吗012---That's great, but isn't it gonna bother you that people think you're a porn star?
不   不会的   我有办法012---Oh, no, no. I know how to handle it.
是吗  没错012---Good. Yeah.
想知道你在哪里见过我012---You're trying to figure out where you know me from?
给你一个提示  成人A片  好吗012---All right, I'll give you a hint. From porn. Okay?
没错  你的变态男朋友  在A片里看过我012---Yeah, your pervert boyfriend watched me in a porno movie!
看吧  对啊012---See? Yeah.
嘿012---Hey.
你对吉儿的看法或许没错   我就知道  怎么了012---You, uh, may have been right about Jill. Oh, I knew it. What happened?
她吻了我   什么  你们都亲嘴了012---Um, she kissed me. What? You kissed?
也许我们应该回避一下012---Maybe we should give them some privacy. Shh!
我尽量不去亲她012---Look, I tried not to kiss her, okay?
听起来不像   想不亲一个人012---It doesn't sound like it. It's pretty easy not to kiss someone.
不要亲就对了  我们现在  就没有亲012---You just don't kiss them. See? Look at us right now, not kissing.
让我说完好吗012---Let me finish, okay?
她过来亲我   我没有阻止012---She started kissing me, and I didn't stop it.
而且我也没有多想012---I guess I just wasn't thinking.
是啊   没有多想   我来让你好好想一想012---Yeah,  that's right you weren't thinking! Y'know what? Let me give you something to think about.
等等012---Hold on.
后来我一想  就把她推开了012---But then I started thinking and I stopped the kissing.
谢谢你把舌头  从我妹的嘴里缩回来告诉我012---Oh, well, thank you for taking your tongue out of my sister's mouth long enough to tell me that.
我是想到  如果我跟吉儿怎样012---Look, I realized if anything were to happen with me and Jill...
我们就再也不能怎样了012---...then nothing could ever happen with us.
什么  不  我是说012---What? No, I mean...
我不知道  我们还会不会怎样012---Look, I don't know if anything is ever going to happen with us again, ever.
但我不想断绝这个可能性012---But I don't wanna know that it never could.
于是我喊停012---So I stopped it...
然后  她气得摔坏了我的投影机012---...and she got mad and broke my projector.
哇哦012---Wow.
我都不知道该说什么了012---I don't even know what to say.
谢谢你012---Thank you.
不客气012---You're welcome.
我的天哪   你在哭吗012---Oh, my God, are you crying?
这两个人为何就是不能在一起012---I just don't see why those two can't work things out.
好  我要走了  我要远离某个012---All right, I'm leaving. I'm not gonna spend one more day...
一直害我的人012---...with someone who's out to sabotage my every move.
就是你   瑞秋012---That's you, Rachel.
我知道012---Yeah, I got that.
还有你  我投怀送抱  你却不要012---And you. I throw myself at you, and you say no?
你够同性恋的啊012---How gay are you?
你自己保重   吉儿012---You take care, Jill.
好  再见  再见012---Okay, see you. Bye-bye.
吉儿居然走了012---I can't believe Jill's gone.
我忍不住了  我一发不可收拾012---I can't help it. I opened a gate.
