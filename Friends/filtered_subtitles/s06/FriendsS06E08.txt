想不想跟我在末日世界012---Would you like to battle me in a post-apocalyptic world...
争夺银河系仅存的能源012---...for control of the galaxy's last remaining energy source?
好啊  邻居  请进012---Sure, neighbor. Come on in.
吉宁在吗012---So, is Janine around?
她去上舞蹈课了012---Uh, no, she’s at dance class.
我可以看看她的房间吗012---Can I check my room?
可以  但是别翻她的东西  她会发疯012---Yeah, but, hey look, don't go through her stuff. She gets really mad.
天哪012---Oh, my God.
一点男人住过的痕迹都没有012---What is th...it's like a guy never lived in here.
小心  这个女性风格很危险  它已经扩散了012---Look, you’ve got to be careful. This girl thing is dangerous. It's spreading already..
是吗012---It is?
这个粉红小抱枕是你的吗012---Yeah, Is this your pretty pink pillow on the couch?
不是012---No.
那个什么都不能装的小盒子呢012---Is that your tiny little box that's too small to put anything in?
也不是012---No. No.
没错  情况很不妙  你是个男人  好嘛012---Okay, this is not good. You are a guy, okay?
这是个"男人"的家012---This is a "guy's" place.
你一旦失去自我  就会开始修指甲012---If you let this go, you’re going to be sitting around with your fingers soaking in stuff..
你说得对  我会找她谈  找她谈谈  做个男子汉012---All right, you're right. I'll talk to her. Talk to her. Be a man.
我是男子汉  保护好你自己012---I'm a man. Defend yourself.
钱德  快点  要缝新的除尘布012---Chandler come on. We have to hem the new dust ruffle.
我马上过去012---Be right there, sweetums.
情况完全不同012---A totally different situation.
老友记  第六季  第8集  罗斯洗牙012---Friends  S06E08  The One With Ross's Teeth
嘿  你们好012---Hey, guys.
跟希拉蕊早餐吃得怎样   还好啊012---Hey, How was breakfast with Hillary? It was okay.
她还是有点因为失恋而沮丧012---She's still kind of depressed because she broke up with her boyfriend.
就是你的性感二厨  希拉蕊吗012---Well, Is this Hillary, your hot assistant chef, Hillary?
没错  我每次进去都盯着我的那个012---Yeah. The one that always stares at me when I come in?
是你挡着路  而看过你一眼的那个012---No. The one who looked at you once because you got in her way.
我还是看得出来  她对我有点意思012---Still, I could tell. She was into me.
你帮我们安排一下嘛012---Well, Why don't you set us up?
你要帮罗斯找对象012---Ooh, are you setting Ross up with someone?
她有婚纱吗012---Does she have a wedding dress?
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
瑞秋  是这样  我在做传单找新客人012---Rachel, Yeah. I'm making up flyers trying to get new massage clients.
我可以去布鲁明岱尔   用复印机吗012---So can I come to Bloomingdale's and use the copy machine?
可以啊   但他们会觉得奇怪   因为我已经离职了012---Well, sure, but they might think it's weird considering I don't work there anymore.
天哪  怎么回事012---Oh, my God. What happened?
我跳槽到罗夫罗兰了012---I got a job at Ralph Lauren.
太好了  恭喜你012---Well, that's great. Congratulations.
都一年了012---A year ago.
你撑了一年  很好012---You've lasted all year. Good for you.
但是  菲比  你还是可以去我现在的公司复印012---But, Pheebs, you could still use the copy machine where I actually work.
午休时间来  免得我老板看到012---But come by at lunch so my boss doesn't see you.
否则金会发疯  她本来就不太喜欢我012---Kim will freak out. She already doesn't like me.
怪了  我的上司也不喜欢我   我的也是012---I don't think my boss likes me. I don't think mine likes me either.
或许这是共通的现象012---Maybe it's a universal thing.
又或许现在是上班时间   你们却在这里打混012---Or maybe because you're all hanging around here at 11:30 on a Wednesday.
上班去吧012---Yeah, let's head off to work.
谢谢  不客气012---Thank you. Sure.
说了你一定不信012---Now you will not believe this.
我在复印时   罗夫罗兰走了进来012---But, I was in the copy room, making copies, and Ralph Lauren came in.
天哪  你有跟他说话吗012---Oh, my God. Did you talk to him?
一点点  他人蛮好的012---Yeah, a little. He seems really nice.
吻功超棒  什么012---Good kisser. What?
什么012---What?
你亲了他   没错012---You kissed him? Totally.
菲比  真的还是假的012---Phoebe, are you serious?
真的  我在里面  他进来自我介绍012---Yeah, I was just in there, he came in and introduced himself.
然后  我们就亲热了  就这样012---The next thing I know, we're making out.You know.
菲比  你知道他已婚吧012---Phoebe,I mean, you do know he's married?
不知道012---No.
菲比012---Phoebe.
难道每次跟男人亲热都要先问012---What am I supposed to do, ask every guy I make outwith if he's married?
不  我是该问012---No, yeah, I should.
嘿  乔伊  嘿012---Hey, Joey. Hey.
可以跟你谈一下吗  你认识照片里012---Uh, can I talk to you for a second? This, uh, kid in this picture. 
这个小孩吗  他是你的亲戚吗012---Do you, uh, know this kid?  Is that like a relative or something?
不是  我只是觉得很可爱012---No. I just thought it was cute.
我就怕这样  好012---Yeah, that's what I was afraid of. Okay, uh...
吉宁  我希望你住得愉快  但是012---Look, Janine, I really want you to feel at home here, but...
你有些东西  太女孩子气了012---...some of this new stuff, it's too girlie.
像什么012---Oh. Like what?
像这个   我们又不认识的可爱宝宝的图片012---Uh, like this. Pictures of cute babies we don't know.
我们不能挂这种东西012---We can't have that.
那是安吉帝斯  她是名艺术家012---Joey, it's Anne Geddes. She's a famous artist.
我不认识这个宝宝  我也不知道她是不是名艺术家012---I don't know this baby. I don't know if she's a famous artist or not.
我不想刁难你  但你做的改变太多了012---I don't want to be a jerk, but you're changing too much around here.
对不起  我只是想让家里舒服一点012---I'm sorry. I just thought I'd try and make the place a little nicer.
但是也太多了012---Yeah, but it's too much stuff.
你摆了蜡烛和那个什么东西012---You know, you got the candles and the "foofy schmoofer" thing here.
这里  还有一幅花洒的画012---Over here, you got a picture of a watering can.
我以为  我相信这个花洒一定很有名012---I just thought-I'm sure it's a famous watering can.
但是拜托啦012---But come on.
浴室那个很烫的棒子是什么012---And what is with the really hot stick in the bathroom?
那是烫发器012---It's a curling iron.
那就没关系012---Oh. Well, that's okay then.
像我的浴巾  我走进浴室012---Okay, my towels, for instance. I come into the bathroom...
我的浴巾却不在地板上012---...and my towel is not on the floor, where I keep it.
而是挂在钩钩上  味道也不一样012---It's up here on some hook. And it smells different.
它变干净了  摸起来也不一样012---It's clean. Yeah, well, it feels different.
它变干了012---It's dry.
好吧  我可以接受干净的浴巾012---All right, I can make my peace with the clean, dry towels.
还有  这些碎片是怎样012---Okay, also, what is with these chips you bought?
不  不  那是干燥花   是用来闻的012---No, no, no. It's potpourri. You're supposed to smell it.
就好像夏天被放在碗里012---Well, that's like summer in a bowl.
金  你好012---Kim, hi.
我一直不知道  你对我的行销报告的看法012---So you know, I…I handed in that marketing report and I never got to hear what you thought.
我没看012---I didn't read it. Ah.
今年的春装一定很棒吧012---So, wow, the spring line's really gonna be great this year, huh?
对012---Yeah.
我听说罗夫罗兰在复印室   跟某人亲热012---So I hear, uh, Ralph Lauren fooled around with someone in the copy room.
从头说起012---Tell me everything.
你们好012---Hey, guysHey.
怎样啊012---What's up?
就是012---You know...
我的天哪012---Oh, my God.
你的牙齿怎么了012---What happened to your teeth?
我漂白了012---I whitened them.
是吗012---Really?
你们觉得呢012---Yeah, what do you think?
我觉得我不该直视它012---I think I shouldn't look directly at them.
少来啊  我是说真的012---Come on, seriously.
确实也白得太夸张了  你的人类012---They're really, really, really white. What was wrong with your old...
的牙齿呢012---...human teeth?
我的确把漂白胶上得太久了012---I did leave the gel on a little longer than it said to.
太久有多久啊   一整天012---How much longer? A day.
你知道  罗斯  今晚要跟希拉蕊约会吧012---Ross you know that tonight is your date with Hillary?
知道  所以我才漂白牙齿  真的  有那么糟吗012---I know. That's why I did it. Come on, are they really that bad?
不  不  不会012---No. No, no, no.
放心好了  希拉蕊是瞎子吧012---You'll be fine. Hillary's blind, right?
过了今晚就是了012---She will be after tonight.
瑞秋  你有没有发现012---Oh, Rach. Uh, do you notice anything--?
你的牙齿  我在外面就看到了012---Your teeth? Yes, I saw them from outside.
说了你们绝对不信012---You guys are never gonna believe this...
菲比跟罗夫罗兰亲热012---...but Phoebe made out with Ralph Lauren.
什么  我的天哪012---What? Oh, my God.
她去我的办公室  然后他们就亲热了012---She ran into him at my office, and they just made out.
最扯的是  我因此赢得老板欢心012---The craziest thing is, now my boss likes me because...
她说这是一整年最棒的八卦012---...I told her about it and she said it was the best gossip she’d heard all year.
今天   我真以我的朋友们为荣012---I am proud of all my friends today.
瑞秋  不敢相信   菲比居然跟罗夫罗兰亲热012---Rachel, I can't believe Phoebe made out with Ralph Lauren.
真是忌妒死了012---Ugh. I'm so jealous.
我是钱德  你活生生的男朋友012---Hi, I'm Chandler, your live-in boyfriend.
钱德  拜托012---Chandler, please. Come on.
你自己看012---Look at him.
我不是女人  不过他还真是秀色可餐啊012---Well, I am no woman, but that is one tasty dish.
嘿012---Hey.
拿去012---Here. Ooh.
那个银发老帅哥是谁012---Who's the silver fox'?
那是你的亲热对象  你不认得吗012---That is your make-out buddy. Don't you recognize him?
等等  "菲比  我爱你  吻我"012---Oh, wait. "Ooh, Phoebe, I love you. Kiss me, please."
那才不是罗夫罗兰   不过声音有点像012---That's not Ralph Lauren. It sounds like him, though.
什么012---What?
不  罗夫跟他一点也不像012---Yeah, no, Ralph doesn't look like that guy.
他很年轻  长发落腮胡  背个大包包012---He's young, and he's got long hair and a beard and a Hacky Sack--
天哪   那不是罗夫罗兰   那是复印小弟肯尼012---Oh, my God. That's not Ralph Lauren. That's Kenny the copy guy.
什么012---What?
完了   我还跑去告诉我老板012---Oh, God-I told my boss that someone made out with Ralph Lauren.
要是她发现我骗她   一定会更讨厌我   菲比012---If she finds out that I lied to her, she is gonna hate me even more. Phoebe!
那个小弟为什么自称罗夫罗兰012---Why would the copy guy say he's Ralph Lauren?
好骗你跟他亲热啊012---To get you to make out with him.
啊哦012---Oh.
也许这件能压住你的白牙012---Okay, maybe this will make them look less white.
不行012---Nope.Heh.
好  没有用的颜色有012---Okay, so colors that don't work are...
蓝  黄  绿  红  黑  白  橘和紫012---...blue, yellow, green, red, black, white, orange and purple.
离约会只剩1小时  我该怎么办012---I don't know what I'm gonna do. That date starts in like an hour.
要是你的肤色白一点  牙齿就不会那么显眼012---Ross, maybe if your skin was lighter, your teeth wouldn't look so bright.
太好了  所以我去换肤就行了  谢谢你012---Oh, great. So all I need to do is get some new skin. Thank you.
我是说你可以化一点妆012---I’m just saying, If we put just a little bit of makeup on you--
哇哦012---Whoa, whoa.
我们已经不是13岁了012---We're not 13 anymore.
罗斯  只剩这个可行的办法012---Ross, this is the only thing left that has a shot at working.
她不会发现我有化妆吗012---Won't she notice I have makeup on?
拜托  半数的男人都有化妆012---Please. Half the guys out there have makeup on.
什么012---What?
半数的人  你就试试看嘛012---Half the people-I mean-Just try it and see.
不要  我死也不化妆012---No, I am not putting on makeup.
罗斯  帮我贴几张传单好吗012---Hello? Ross, could you put up some of these flyers for me?
魔鬼  魔鬼012---No! Demon! Demon!
这样抽屉就会闻起来香香的  旧裤袜也没浪费012---Now our drawers will smell nice, and we didn't waste these pantyhose.
是啊  扔旧内衣会遭天打雷劈012---God forbid we throw out old underwear.
我要去乔伊那边012---You know what? I'm gonna go over to Joey's.
我们还要整理包装纸抽屉012---We're supposed to organize the wrapping paper.
对  但我今天已经够女性化了012---Yes, but I've really gotten in touch with my feminine side enough today.
要是再缝两个香袋   我们就要变成女同志了012---You know. In fact I think we're two sachets away from becoming a lesbian couple.
今天的确很女孩子气  你说得对  抱歉012---This has been kind of a girlie day. You're right. I'm sorry.
不会  我只是想去男人的家012---Nah, Nah, it’s okay. I feel like I need to be in guy place....
做男人做的事012---..You know, do kind of like a man thing.
没错  去乔伊家吧012---Yeah. Go over to Joey's. Go over to Joey's and...
去乔伊家喝啤酒槌墙壁012---...drink some beer and hammer up some dry wall.
男人并非只会喝酒槌墙壁012---You know when guys hang out, they don't just drink beer and hammer up dry wall.
女生也不会只穿内衣打枕头仗012---When girls hang out, we don't have pillow fights in our underwear.
对不起  我们会012---I'm sorry. We do. We do.
我不知道为什么说不会012---I don't know why I said that.
钱德012---Hey, Chandler.
进来  我们在织隔热手套012---Come on in. We're knitting potholders.
不了  乔瑟芬012---No, thanks, Josephine.
罗斯  我想说012---Ross, I was wondering if--
天哪  男人都死哪去了012---Oh, my God. Where are all the men?
金  瑞秋012---Oh. Hi, Kim. Hi, Rachel.
记得我昨天说的事吗  其实没那回事012---Yeah, remember that thing I told you that happened yesterday? Well, it didn't happen.
你没有取消台湾的布料订单012---You didn't cancel the fabric order from Taiwan?
嗯  有两件事不是那么回事012---Okay, two things didn't happen.
我不是说有人在复印室  跟罗夫罗兰亲热012---Remember I told you someone made out with Ralph Lauren in the copy room?
结果是假的012---Well, it turns out that's not true.
是假的  那就好玩了012---It's not true? Oh, that's interesting.
因为我去查过   昨天午休时间012---Because I checked. Only one keycard was used to access the copy machine...
刷卡进复印室的  只有你一个  瑞秋012---...yesterday during lunch, and that keycard belonged to you, Rachel.
不  天哪  你以为我跟他亲热012---Oh, no. No, no, no. Oh, God, you think I made outwith him?
听着  要是你以为跟罗夫上床  就能坐上我的位子012---Listen to me, if you think sleeping with Ralph is gonna get you my job...
你就错了012---..you are sadly mistaken.
我不想坐你的位子   真的012---Oh, no. I don't want your job. I don't.
这真是天大的误会  我没跟他亲热012---Oh, this is such a mistake. I didn't make outwith him.
没人跟他亲热   我昨天没用我的卡012---Nobody made out with him. I did not use my keycard yesterday.
我连刷卡都不会012---I don't even know how to use my keycard.
罗夫  金012---Hi, Ralph. Hi, Kim.
是啊  没跟他亲热012---Yeah. Nothing happened.
刚才的情欲张力一触即发012---You could cut the sexual tension in here with a knife.
之后  我也只能去当厨师012---After that, what could I do except become a chef?
我将来想自己开餐厅012---And someday soon, I hope to open my own restaurant.
嗯012---Mm.
你很善于倾听012---You know, you're a really great listener.
我交往过的男人  多半讲个不停012---Most guys I go outwith, they just talk and talk.
听到后来  真想叫他们闭嘴012---After a while, it's like, "Shut your mouth." You know?
我说太多了  来聊聊你吧012---I've probably been talking too much. Why don't we talk about you?
说嘛  我想知道012---Come on, I want to know.
好  我是长岛人012---Okay. I'm from Long Island.
来纽约念书012---I came to the city for college.
我有个5岁的儿子  平常喜欢012---Um, I, uh, have a 5-year-old son, and in my spare time...
看看谍报小说  再来聊聊你吧012---...I like to read spy novels. But let's talk more about you. Hmm?
如果先把花茎底部  在平底锅上烤一下012---So what's really neat. if you sear the stems of the flowers first in a frying pan...
花就能开得更久  是不是很棒012---...your arrangement will look fresh much longer.
好棒的小秘诀012---Joey, that is such a great tip.
摩妮卡  请你出去一下  我有事找那位插花的女士012---Monica, can you excuse us? I need to talk to the girl with the flowers.
乔伊  你待会过来012---Okay, but, Joey, come over later.
我教你  用松果和花生酱012---I'm gonna teach you how to make a bird feeder...
做喂鸟器012---...out of just a pine cone and some peanut butter.
我最喜欢鸟了012---Aw. I love birds.
你是怎么搞的012---What is the matter with you?
什么  你在插花012---What? You're arranging flowers.
你放枯掉的花012---You got dead flowers.
你装扮成一朵花的宝宝照片012---You've got a picture of a baby dressed like flowers.
这不是乔伊012---This is not Joey.
嘿  我还是乔伊   好吗012---Hey, hey, look, I am still Joey, okay?
花  只不过是很好看012---Flowers, they're just, you know, nice to look at.
那是一个名摄影师照的  宝宝也很有名012---And that happens to be a picture by a famous artist of a famous baby.
你正在变成女人012---You're turning into a woman.
我没有012---No, I'm not.
你怎么这么说   好恶劣啊012---Why would you say that? That's just mean.
我惹你生气了  我说了什么012---Now I've upset you? What did I say?
不是你说了什么   是你的口气012---It's not what you said. It's the way you said it.
天哪012---Oh, my God.
我是女人012---I'm a woman.
现在她觉得我跟他上床  好把她踢下去012---So now she thinks that I made out with him and that I did it to get her job.
你怎么不跟她说实话  我说了012---Why didn't you just tell the truth? I did.
但是她觉得不会有人蠢到  把复印小弟当成罗夫罗兰012---but she doesn’t think anyone would be stupid enough to confuse Kenny the copy guy with Ralph Lauren.
如果肯尼才是公司的首脑呢012---Well, hey, what if Kenny were the real brains behind the whole company?
搞不好罗夫罗兰也只是个门面012---You know. What if Kenny hired that Ralph guy to be the pretty front man, huh?
她想过吗012---Did she ever think of that?
你今天跟肯尼约会了吧012---You were with Kenny today, weren't you?
只有一下下了012---Just for a second. Ugh.
菲比  我该怎么办012---Phoebe, what am I gonna do? Well...
你只好跟罗夫罗兰上床了012---The only thing you can do. Sleep with Ralph Lauren.
我才不跟罗夫罗兰上床   我可以  但是我不会012---I'm not gonna sleep with Ralph Lauren. I mean, I could, but I wouldn't.
跟肯尼上床012---Ooh. Sleep with Kenny.
那样对我也没好处  好处可大了012---That wouldn't help me. Oh, yes, it would.
今晚真的很开心012---I've had a really good time tonight. Mm-hm.
我很少第一次约会   就这么心有灵犀012---You know, I rarely connect with someone this much on the first date.
我也是012---Me neither.
我也很开心012---Uh, I've had a really good time too, you know.
你要吃那块面包吗012---Are you gonna eat that bread?
我只是喜欢闻012---Oh, I just like the smell.
你好搞笑啊012---You make me laugh.
要不要去沙发上坐坐012---Would you like to move over to the couch?
嗯  嗯012---Mm-hm.
我把灯光调暗一点好了012---Maybe I'll just turn down the lights a little?
干脆关灯如何012---How about all the way?
好012---0Kay.
好酷的海报012---Wow, cool poster.
还是要说 "好抢眼的海报"012---Or should I say, "groovy poster"?
那个012---So, uh...
刚才聊到哪里012---...where were we?
那是你的牙齿吗012---Are those your teeth?
对012---Oh.
你看得见是吧012---You can see them, huh?
对  白得很吓人012---Yes. They're insanely white.
我特地为你漂白的012---I did that for you.
你有毛病吗012---What's the matter with you?
我有毛病  你还装黑光灯咧   都1999年了012---What's the matter with me? You've got a black light. It's 1999.
太好了   金012---Oh, good. Kim, hi.
瑞秋  我一直想问你  你看过新的罗夫罗兰床单吗012---Hi, Rachel. Oh. I wanted to ask you, have you seen the new Ralph Lauren sheets?
我在想什么  你当然看过012---What am I thinking? Of course you have.
