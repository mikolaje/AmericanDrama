快看  你们一定不信012---Hey. You're not going to believe this.
我编了一则笑话寄到《花花公子》012---I made up a joke and sent it in to Playboy.
结果登出来了012---They printed it. Yeah.
我不知道《花花公子》也登笑话012--- I didn't know Playboy prints jokes.
他们有笑话   专访   扎实新闻报导012---Yeah, they print jokes, interviews, hard-hitting journalism.

你的笑话一大堆啊012---You tell a lot of jokes.
钱德  那是我的笑话012---Look, Chandler, it's my joke.
他们没有印投稿人  这样你会觉得好过一点吧012---But if it makes you feel any better, they don't print the name.
所以是谁的并不重要   对吧012---So it doesn't really matter who gets credit. right?
大概是吧012---Yeah, I guess.

通通都很吵012---...It's like a lotta noise to me. I don't know...
乔伊  第四台为什么断了012---Joey, Why is your cable out?
因为我没缴钱012---Uh... Oh, because I haven't really paid the bill. Heh, heh.
你若缺钱   拜托让我借你好吗012---If you need money, would you please-please let me loan you some money?

电话费缴了吗   没怎么缴够012---Paid your phone bill? Not so much.

我也想看012---I want to look too!
好嗯012---Yikes!
这些照片是有故事性吗012---So do you think these pictures are trying to tell a story?
当然有啊  像这位年轻小姐012---Oh, yeah, sure. I mean, Like in the case of this young woman...
她的衣服没了012---...she has lost her clothes.
所以  她光溜溜的骑着马大喊   "我的衣服呢  我的衣服呢"012---So she rides naked on the horse, she's crying out, "Where are they? Where are they?"
光躺在草地上是找不到的012---Well, she's not going to find them, lying in the grass like that.

她很可爱   也很阳光012---She's cute, she's outdoorsy.
而且她会生火  可以派上用场012---And she knows how to build a fire. That'll come in handy.
我有一个问题012---I got a question.
如果要在我们当中挑女朋友  你们会选中谁012---If you had to pick one of us to date, who would it be?
不知道   我也不知道012---I don't know. Me neither.
瑞秋012---Rachel.
什么012---What?
不知道012---I don't know.
我也不知道012---Me neither.
我都忘了《红心合唱团》  有那么多经典012---You know, you forget how many great songs Heart had.
对啊012---Yeah.
《海狠》是我练键盘学的第一首歌012---You know, "Barracuda" was the first song I learned to play on the keyboard.
你听过  弹过012---So you heard it, you repeated it...
所以  那首歌是你写的了012---...so that must mean you wrote it.
你们怎么还在争啊  老实说012---Oh, you guys with this joke. Well, I gotta say...
我是有大笑   可是我还是看不太懂012---...I know I cracked up, but I'm not even sure I got it.
什么012---What?
你看不懂012---You didn't get it?
那个医生是一只猴子012---The doctor is a monkey.
猴子没办法开处方012---And monkeys can't write out prescriptions.
我的笑话不准你笑012---You are not allowed to laugh at my joke.
你的笑话012---Your joke?
"海夫纳"（花花公子创始人）可不同意012---Well, I think "the Hef" would disagree.
所以他寄了这张012---Which is why he sent me a check...
百元支票给我012---...for $100.
你偷我的笑话  还偷我的钱012---So you stole my joke and you stole my money?
我本来要在柜员机里存进去的012---Well, I was gonna stick it in the ATM.
现在我决定  让那位性感女柜员012---But now I think I'll show the sexy teller...
知道我是个作家012---...that I am a published writer.
她会知道笑话是你偷来的012---Well, she'll know that you stole the joke.
你想怎么样   跟着我去吗012---Oh, what are you going to do, follow me down there?

像付帐之类的  所以012---...paying for stuff, so...
你可以来这里工作012---Well, if you want, you can work here.
我不知道012---Uh, I don't know.
是这样的012---It's just...
我演过连续剧012---See, I was a regular on a soap opera, you know?
从明星到服务生  我实在012---And to go from that to this, it's just...
而且  还得招呼我所有的朋友012---And plus, I'd have to wait on all my friends.
明白  但这里薪水很高012---Okay. But the money's good.
还可以看瑞秋看个够012---Plus, you get to stare at Rachel as much as you want.
什么012---What?
工作时间很弹性012---Flexible hours.
也许可以啊012---Maybe I could be a waiter.
我可以用电话吗012---Could I use the phone?
她选瑞秋012---She picked Rachel.
她想改口  但是很明显   她选瑞秋012---I mean, she tried to back out of it, but it was obvious. She picked Rachel.
他偷了我的笑话  就这么偷走了012---He took my joke. He just took it.
这是错误的  还有什么是不对的012---This is wrong. You know what else is wrong?
菲比选了瑞秋012---Phoebe picking Rachel.
还有谁会选瑞秋  罗斯012---You know who else picked Rachel? Ross.

我要买一本笑话日记本012---I'm gonna get a joke journal, you know?
记录我每次讲笑话的日期时间012---And document the date and time of every single one of my jokes.
好主意  知道什么主意不好012---Good idea. Know what's a bad idea?
选择瑞秋   没错012---Picking Rachel. That's right.
什么声音012---Did you hear something?
也许是罗斯爬进我的脑袋   窃取我的思维012---Maybe it's the sound of Ross climbing into my brain and stealing my thoughts.
是客厅传来的012---It's coming from the living room.
我的书看完了012---I finished my book.
大家好  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
你们好可爱012---Don't you guys look cute.
真是可爱的情侣012---You guys make a cute couple.
摩妮卡  你在干嘛012---Monica, what are you doing?
没什么  我只是想重温前两天的乐趣012---Nothing, Just trying to re-create some of the fun that we had at my place the other day.
记得吗  就是你选瑞秋  不选我那次012---Remember? When you picked Rachel over me?
多好玩啊012---That was funny. Ha, ha, ha.
是蛮好玩的   一点也不好玩012---It was kind of funny. It wasn't funny at all!
你为什么选她012---Why would you do that?
为什么不选我012---Why didn't you pick me?
好012---Fine.
我之所以稍微倾向瑞秋012---The reason I was leaning a little bit more toward Rachel than you...
是因为你012---...is just, you know, you're...
有点难搞   我们去吃饭吧012---...high maintenance. Let's go to lunch.
哪有这回事啊012---That is completely untrue.
你觉得我难搞   证明给我看012---You think I'm high maintenance? Okay, Prove it.
你列一张清单  我们逐条讨论012---I want you write out a list, and we're going to go through it point by point.
不   你说的对  你很好相处012---No, you're right, you're easygoing.
只是没有瑞秋那么好相处  她比较012---You're just not as easygoing as Rachel. you know, She's just more...
有弹性  比较圆融   就这样012---...flexible and mellow. That's all.
每个人都不一样012---Well, people are different.
瑞秋什么都好  怎么欺负她都行012---Ya, you know, Rachel...she'll do whatever you want. Y'know, you can just walk all over her.
慢着  你是说我没个性吗  我有个性012---What? Wait a minute. What are you saying, that I'm a pushover? I'm not a pushover.
好  你有个性012---Oh, okay. You're not a pushover.
天哪   你觉得我没个性012---You think I'm a pushover. Well, watch this.
你听着  我们不跟你去吃饭了012---you know what? You're not invited to lunch!
怎么样   够强硬了吧012---What do you think of that? I think that's pretty strong.
我就是这么想的  快点  摩妮卡  我们去吃饭012---that's what I think. Come on, Monica, let's go to lunch.
清单给我列出来012---You start working on that list.
她真是太扯了  就是啊  你想吃什么012---I cannot believe her. I know. Where do you want to eat?
我很喜欢那家日本料理   我吃腻日本菜了  不去那家012---Oh-Oh, I love that Japanese place. I'm sick of Japanese. Not going there.

没关系啦  对吧  阿甘012---No, it's okay. Right, Gunther?
别跟我使眼色012---Don't wink at me.
把围裙穿上012---And put on your apron.
穿就穿012---Okay. Heh, heh.
你怎么不叫其他客人穿围裙012---but I don’t see you asking other paying customers to put on aprons.
乔伊  你在这里打工吗  没有012---Joey, do you work here? No.
服务生  什么事012---Waiter. Yeah!
乔伊  怎么回事  为什么不告诉我们你在这里打工012---Joey, what's going on'? Why didn't you tell us you work here?
嗯012---Uh...
这件事其实挺尴尬的  我之前是演员  现在是服务生012---It's kind of embarrassing. I mean, I was an actor, now I'm a waiter.
一般应该反过来才对啊012---It's supposed to go in the other direction.
你的围裙反穿了  成披风了012---So's your apron. You're wearing it like a cape.
这份工作很简单   薪水很高012---I mean, the job's easy and the money's good, you know?
反正我也在这儿混   干脆赚个钱012---I guess I'm going to be hanging out here anyway. I might as well get paid for it, right?
只是要招呼你们   感觉上很怪012---I just feel kind of weird serving you guys, you know?
怎么会呢012---It'll be great.
乔伊  我也做过  还好啊012---Come on, I did it and it was fine.

确实没那么怪012---Okay. It doesn't seem that weird.
我说真的   我点的咖啡还没来012---Seriously, I asked before. You still haven't gotten it.
看嘛  现在又变怪了012---See, now it's weird again.
你来这里工作是好事   你会赚大钱   先给你一个忠告012---I think it's great that you work here. You're gonna make a lot of money. Here's your first tip.

菲比  我们想跟你谈谈012---Phoebe, we'd like to talk to you for a second.
行啊012---0Kay.
或许  我是有点难搞012---So, maybe I am a little high maintenance.
或许  瑞秋是有一点没个性012---And maybe Rachel is a little bit of a pushover.
但你知道  你是什么吗012---But you know what we decided you are?
很抱歉这么说   但是你   菲比  是个怪人012---Yes, we are very sorry to tell you this, but you, Phoebe, are flaky.

那我难搞也无所谓了012---Then I'm okay with being high maintenance.
我没个性也无所谓012---Yeah. And I am okay with being a pushover.
太好了  无所谓就好012---That's great. Good for you guys.
我才不难搞   我才不会没个性012---I am not high maintenance! I am not a pushover!
谁说你们是了  你啊012---Who said you were? You did!
我是怪人  专门乱说话012---I'm flaky. I'll say anything.
阿甘012---Hey, Gunther.

"抱歉  这个位子有人坐"012---"I'm sorry, that seat's saved."
就这些  对啊  或许不是他的死党  但是012---That's the whole part? Okay, maybe he's not his best friend, but...
好吧  1小时后见012---Okay, I'll see you in an hour.
天哪012---Oh, man.
我绝对能拿到那个角色  "抱歉  这个位子有人坐"012---I could totally get that part. "I'm sorry, this seat is taken."
抱歉  不  我不是说你012---Oh, excuse me. No, no, I didn't mean you. 
但你以为这是真的吧012---But you believed me, huh?
我以为你在帮别人占位子012---I believed you were saving this seat for someone.
所以你会用我啦012---So you'd hire me, right?
用你干嘛012---For what?
就是说嘛  各位请注意012---Exactly! All right, everybody listen up!

让摩妮卡决定吧  好吧012---No. Let's have Monica decide. Yeah.
小妹  亲爱的  出来一下012---Hey, Mon! Mon, get out here!
摩妮卡  好012---Monica? Okay.
你来帮我们决定   这个笑话是谁的012---You have to help us decide whose joke this is.

因为你才能客观公正012---You're the only one that can be fair. Yeah.
我不能   你是我男朋友012---I can't be. You're my boyfriend.
但我是你哥  我们是一家人012---But I'm your brother. We're family.

钱德   你先说012---Chandler, you go first.
好  我是2个月前  跟史提夫吃饭时想到的012---Okay, I thought of the joke two months ago at lunch with Steve.
就是圣诞节遇到的那家伙吗   让我说完好吗012---Oh, wait, is he the guy I meet him at Christmas? Can I finish my story?

两个小孩012---Two babies.
请继续  好012---Continue. Okay.
史提夫说他要去看医生   他的医生姓侯奇012---Steve said he had to go to the doctor. And his doctor's name is Dr. Mompey.
我就说  "猴子医生"   所以才会有猴子医生这个笑话012---I said, "Dr. Monkey?" And that is how the whole Dr. Monkey thing came up.
你开什么玩笑012---Are you kidding?
我是学进化论的012---Okay, look, I study evolution.
记得吧  进化论012---Remember? Evolution.

可以了  我决定好了012---I've heard enough. I've made my decision.
哦  好吧   请说012---Oh! Okay, so what--? Do tell.
你们两个都是白痴012---You are both idiots.
那个笑话不但不好笑   还冒犯了女性012---The joke is not funny, and it's offensive to women.
还有医生   还有猴子012---And doctors. And monkeys.
你们不该争笑话是谁的012---You shouldn't argue over who gets credit.
应该争的是  谁让这世界受这种罪012---You should be arguing over who gets blamed for inflicting this horrible joke upon the world.
别再争了012---Now, let it go.
那个笑话烂透了012---The joke sucks.
那是你的笑话   不是012---It's your joke. It is not.
钱德  天呐  你在这里  嘿012---Oh, my God, Chandler, there you are. Hi.
嘿  是菲比和瑞秋012---Hey, it's Phoebe and Rachel.
你要不要告诉她们012---Why don't you tell them...
你刚才说我并不难搞012---...what you were telling me earlier about me not being high maintenance.
摩妮卡是个自信沉着的女性012---Monica is a self-sufficient, together lady.
跟她在一起就像是在度假012---Being with her has been like being on a vacation.
至于所谓的难搞嘛012---And what may be perceived as high maintenance...
只是注重小细节012---...is merely attention to detail...
和012---...and...
心灵的慷慨012---...generosity of spirit.
哇  这真是我所听过的  最棒的假话012---Wow. You know what? That is the best fake speech I think I've ever heard.
真的  我还听过更棒的012---Really? I've heard better.
等等   那是他自己说的  你告诉她们  钱德012---Wait, he came up with that himself. Tell them, Chandler.
我已经词穷了  可不可以重复012---I'm out of words. Should I just say the whole thing again?
我一点也不难搞012---Look, I am not high maintenance!
一点也不难搞   钱德012---I am not. Chandler!
你只有一点点难搞012---You're a little high maintenance.
你上我的黑名单了012---You are on my list!
对不起  你并不012---Look, I'm sorry, but you're not--
你并不好相处  但你很热情012---You're not easygoing, but you're passionate.
这样就很好012---And that's good.
当你为小事不高兴时   我觉得我特别能012---And when you get upset about little things, I think I'm pretty good...
安抚你的012---...at making you feel better about that.
那样也很好  所以她们说你难搞012---That's good too. They say you're high maintenance...
也没错   因为我喜欢012---...but it's okay, because I like...
搞定你012---...maintaining you.
我没叫他说这些012---I didn't even tell him to say that.
好吧012---Aw. Okay.
你从黑名单除名了  我被除名了012---All right, you're off my list. I'm off the list.
菲比012---Phoebe?
你不找我当女朋友也没关系012---It's okay that you don't want me to be your girlfriend.
因为我有最棒的男朋友012---Because I have the best boyfriend.
我突然觉得你好迷人012---You know, suddenly I find you very attractive.
兄弟  试镜结果如何012---Hey, buddy boy, How'd the audition go?
不  不太好012---Oh, not good. No.
我没拿到那个角色  这里的工作也没了  所以012---I didn't get the part. And I lost my job here, so...
好惨烈的试镜012---Wow, that is a bad audition.
这里的工作为什么没了012---Well, how did you lose your job here?
我要去试镜012---Well, I had the audition...
但阿甘叫我看店  他好去染头发012---...but Gunther said I had to stay here and be in charge so he could get his hair dyed.
但我还是去了  他就炒我鱿鱼012---So I went anyway, and he fired me.
他扔下工作去办私事012---He left work in the middle of the day to do a personal errand...
叫才来两天的你看店012---...and left you in charge when you've been here two days?
这样不对吧012---That's not right.
但是能怎么办012---What are you gonna do?
乔伊  你不能就这么算了012---Joey, you can't let him get away with that.
我绝不放过他   我要去教训他012---Ya know what, I won't let him get away with that. I'm gonna say something to him--
不  我不该多事  不  我要去教训他012---No, I really shouldn't say anything. No, I should say something to him!
阿甘  让乔伊继续在这里打工012---Gunther? I want you to give Joey his job back.
你这样解雇他  很不好012---That is really not fair that you have to fire him-Okay.
什么  他可以继续工作012---What? He can have his job back.
没错  他可以继续工作012---That's right, he can have his job back.
说开了就好了012---Glad we got that all straightened out.
好了  乔伊012---There you go, Joey.
你可以继续工作了  太好了  谢谢你  瑞秋012---Got your job back. That's great. Thanks, Rach.
不赖吧  谁没个性了012---Pretty nice, huh? Now who's a pushover?
瑞秋  你坐到我的位子了  抱歉012---Rach, you're in my seat. I'm sorry.
你们都没说会找谁当女朋友012---Hey, I never got to hear who you'd pick to be your girlfriend.
我选你  菲比  没错   绝对是你012---I'd pick you, Phoebe. Yeah, definitely you, Pheebs.
我也这么觉得012---Yeah, I kind of thought.
没错  绝对是你012---Never. It would totally be you.
嘿012---Hey.
我有个问题   如果你们要找其中一个人当男朋友012---Hey. Oh, I have a question. If-if-if one of you had to pick one of the other two to go out with...
你们会找谁012---...who would you pick?
少来  我拒绝回答012---No way. I'm not answering.
