罗斯和瑞秋留言  说要结婚012---Ross and Rachel left us a message saying they were getting married!
你们不是来找他们的吗  当然是012---Isn't that why you guys are here? Yes.
不然我们来这儿干什么啊012---Why else would we be here? Ha-ha-ha.
怎么样  我们来晚了吗012---Well, what happened? Did we miss it?
我们也没赶上012---We actually missed it.
可能都是因为教堂里不能奔跑012---Well, Maybe you wouldn't have if you could run in the chapel!
真是太扯了012---This is insane.
有什么关系呢  又不是真结婚012---What's the big deal? It's not like it's a real marriage.
什么012---What?
在赌城结婚  只在赌城内有效012---If you marry in Vegas, you're only married in Vegas.
你在说什么  在赌城结婚到处都有效012---What are you talking about? If you get married in Vegas you’re married everywhere.
真的012---Really?
是啊012---Yeah.
我的妈呀012---Oh, my God.
啊  随便啦012---Oh, well.
老友记  第六季  第1集  离开拉斯维加斯012---Friends  S06E01  The One After Vegas
我们为什么躺在一起012---Why are we in bed together?
我不知道012---I don't know.
你有穿衣服吗012---Do you have any clothes on?
有012---Yes.
真的  没有012---Really? No.
但是我们没有012---But we didn't have...
嘿咻吧012---...sex, did we?
我不太记得昨晚的事012---I don't remember much about last night.
一切都好模糊012---It was such a blur. Ha, ha. Oh.
我记得我有笑   我一直笑012---I remember laughing. I laughed a lot. Uh-huh?
而且我们没怎样012---Then we didn't have sex.
我们真的醉得很惨012---Oh, I mean, we were really drunk.
幸好没干什么蠢事012---I'm glad we didn't do anything stupid.
可不是吗012---Tell me about it.
菲比  早012---Morning, Pheebs. Mm.
我的电影取消拍摄了012---Well, my movie has been officially canceled.
哇啊  乔伊  好可惜喔  你要不要吃我的早餐012---Mm. Joey, I'm so sorry. You want some of my breakfast?
算了  我沮丧的吃不下啊012---Nah, I’m too depressed to eat.
过五分钟再说吧012---I'll probably eat in, like, five minutes.
我只好跟你们回去了  飞机是几点012---So I guess I'll fly home with you. What time is your flight?
我的计程车呢  我用不着了012---What about my cab? I don't need that anymore.
乔伊  你跟我借车  就要开回去012---No, Joey! you borrowed my cab. You have to drive it back.
我不想自己开回去  太寂寞了012---I don't wanna drive back by myself. I get lonely.
干脆你来陪我012---Oh, ooh. How about if you come with me?
我不知道   要开很久  一定很好玩012---I don't know, it's a long trip. That would be great.
我们可以聊天玩游戏012---We could talk and play games.
这是让友谊变新鲜的好机会012---This could be our chance to, like, renew our friendship.
你要我跟你〝友谊复兴〞012---Are you asking me to have a "frienaissance"?
是吧012---Sure?
好吧   虽然没这个必要  但我一直爱着你012---Heh. All right, although I don't think we need one. I never stopped loving you.
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
有谁跟盖勒博士夫妇讲过话啊012---So, has anyone talked to Dr. and Mrs. Geller yet?
他们有留言给我   应该快到了012---Mm-hm. They left me a message. They'll be here.

摩妮卡和我昨晚差点结婚012---Monica and I almost got married last night.
天哪012---My God!
这可是大事012---That's huge! Ha-ha-ha, hey.
等等  为什么没找我去012---Wait a minute. Why wasn't I invited?
谁要当你的伴郎  不要说罗斯  不准说罗斯012---And who was gonna be your best man? Don't say Ross. Do not say Ross.
我觉得我们还没准备好  我很爱她012---I just don't think that Monica and I are ready to get married yet! Y’know? I mean, I love her...
但看到罗斯他们从教堂冒出来012---...but seeing Ross and Rachel come out of that chapel...
我突然惊觉  我们进展得太快了012---...was like a wake-up call that Monica and I are moving so fast, you know.
我要怎么讲才不会让她心碎012---How do I tell her without crushing her?
就说她不是结婚的料012---Tell her she's not marriage material.
什么012---What?
女生都这么对我说012---Girls say it to me all the time.
相信我   要是她和我一样  一定会如释重负012---And believe me, And if she's anything like me, she's just gonna be relieved.
我该怎么说  这样太快了012---How do I tell Chandler that it's too soon?
他一定会心碎  觉得我不爱他了012---It’s gonna break his heart, he’s not gonna think that I don’t love him anymore.
你是不爱他了  我爱012---Well, you don't. Yes, I do.
很好  我只是在测试你012---Good. I was just testing you.
嘿  噢  嗨012---Hey. Oh, hi.
我们刚才聊到培根012---Y’know, We were just talking about bacon.
不对  我们是在聊网球012---No, we were talking about tennis.
网球比较像真的012---Tennis is more believable.
嘿  嘿012---Hey.
嗨  谢谢012---Hi. Thank you.
咖啡012---Coffee. Heh. Mm.

昨晚的事吗012---...about what you guys did last night, or?
昨晚什么事  昨晚又没怎样012---What do you mean "last night"? Nothing, uh, happened last night.
罗斯把大家都找去看了012---Uh-huh. Ross invited us all to watch.
瑞秋  我们不可能错过朋友的婚礼012---Rach, we weren't gonna miss our friends marrying.
谁结婚了012---Huh, who got married?
你们啊012---You did?
什么012---What? Heh.
我们哪有结婚  怎么可能  别闹了012---Wh...? Hello. We didn't get married. No, we didn't. That’s ridiculous!...
等等  我们  我记得去过教堂012---Wait, wait, wait. I remember being in a chapel.
我们醉成那样  不可能被批准结婚的012---They would not let us get married when we were that drunk.
醉成那样  也当然可能012---They let you get married when you’re drunk!
在赌城结婚的人通常都醉了012---Most people who marry in Vegas are drunk.
我现在就醉了012---Heh, I'm drunk right now.
早餐不能喝鸡尾酒啊  我在度假012---I can't have a mimosa with breakfast? I'm on vacation.
你们要怎么办012---What are you gonna do?
看来得找个离婚律师了012---Well, I guess we find a divorce lawyer. Uh-huh.
我想罗斯已经有一个了012---Well, I think, I think Ross already has one.
这次会免费吧012---Now, this one's free, right?
你办了两次  所以会送一次012---Because you paid for the first two, third one free.
你笑吧  丢脸的是你012---Laugh it up, but the joke's on you...
我们不必离婚012---...because we don't need to get divorced.
只要办理注销  住校012---We're just gonna get an annulment. an annulment?
罗斯  学校可帮不了你012---Ross, I don't think surgery is the answer here.
那是你的正字标记012---Oh, that's your thing!
什么012---What?
你的正字标记  你是专门离婚的人012---Your thing, Y’know? that you're the guy who gets divorced.
没错012---Oh, yeah.
那才不是我的正字标记012---No, no, that's not "my thing."
我并不爱离婚012---I do not love getting divorced.
你当然爱  这是你第三次离婚012---Yes, you do. This is your third divorce.
你爱离婚爱到搞不好会娶它012---You love divorce so much, you're probably gonna marry it...
然后婚姻破裂  你又得离婚  离婚名人012---...and then it won't work out, so you're gonna have to divorce it, divorcing guy.
我醉得好厉害012---I'm so drunk.
你觉得我们该怎么办  我不知道012---So, what should we do? I don't know.
但我知道我爱你012---I know I love you.
我也知道我爱你012---I know I love you. Heh.
那我们还要012---So where are we on the whole "going back...
回过头去结婚吗  我爱你012---...to where they have the marriages" thing? I love you.
问得好012---That's a good question.
昨晚我们让骰子决定012---Look umm, Last night we let the dice decide.
也许应该再让命运决定一次  我爱你012---Maybe we should leave it up to fate again. I love you!
没错   有征兆我们才结婚012---Yes, We don't get married unless there's a sign.
好吗  那么012---Okay? So say, uh...
要是你又掷出8来  就表示我们绝对应该结婚012---You roll another eight, then there’s a definite sign that we should get married.
好  8就结婚012---All right. Eight we get married...
其他就不结012---...but 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, we don't get married.
听起来不错  好012---Sounds great. Okay.
有人要掷了012---Hey, we got a shooter.
请押注012---Money, please.
好了吗  好了012---Ready? Ready.
来个8吧012---Come on, eight.
没错  8012---Yes, yes, eight.
8   3加5是8012---Eight, easy eight.
哇   居然真的是8  真是太不可能了012---Wow, I can't believe I rolled an eight. That was so unlikely.
那就结婚吧  我猜012---Well, let's get married. I guess. Aah.
等等   那不是双四八  我昨晚掷的是双四八012---Wait a minute. That wasn't hard eight!  Last night I rolled a hard eight.
没错  这个8不对  不能结婚了  妈的012---That’s right! It was the wrong kind of eight. No wedding! Damn it!
我好想结婚喔012---Agh! Aah! Unh, I wanted it so bad!
收拾行李去  好012---Wanna go pack? Yeah.
我们没做错吧  当然  没错012---We're doing the right thing, right? Oh, of course we are.
我们让命运决定012---Heh, we left it up to fate.
如果我们应该结婚  一定会有明确的征兆012---If we were supposed to get married, there would be a clear-cut sign.
好  你还剩十九个问题  要好好把握012---Okay, you have 19 questions left. Use them wisely.
快点  乔伊  你不能赢了  如果你不问012---Come on, Joey. You can't win if you don't ask any...
问题012---questions!
怎样啦  你说会很好玩012---What? You promised me a fun road trip.
结果我们开了六小时  你就睡了五个小时半012---We've been on the road for 6 hours, and you've been asleep for 5 and a half.
到下一个休息站就换手  你给我一路开回去012---We are switching at the next rest stop and you are going to drive all the way back!
这是对你的惩罚   贪睡鬼012---That will be your punishment, you greedy sleeper.
好啦  好啦 012---All right. All right.
现在你得唱歌给我听012---Yeah. And until then, you are going to sing to me.
因为收音机坏了  你又很自私  但歌声很好听012---Because the radio's broken, and you are selfish, but you have a nice voice.
是喔  快唱012---Really? Sing!
真是开也开不完012---Man, this is a long drive.
我的眼睛  睁开了吗012---Are my eyes open?
没有012---No!
早安012---Morning. Aah!
嘿  老公012---Hey. Hey, hubby. Heh.
我想找你讨论012---Yeah. Actually, um, I wanted to talk to you...
注销婚姻的事012---...about that whole annulment thing. Uh-huh?
我不打算去办012---Yeah, I'm not gonna do that.
好012---Okay. Heh.
那我们就维持婚姻关系012---So we'll just stay married.
是的  没错012---Yes, exactly.
我会请大家叫我盖勒太太012---And I will make everyone call me Mrs. Geller.
真是太棒了012---Wow, this is so amazing.
我还以为得加把劲说服你012---I, uh, really thought I'd have to talk you into this more.
我现在怕了  因为你好像不是在说笑012---Okay, see now I’m scared because I don't actually think you're kidding.
我不是啊012---I'm not kidding.
听着  我012---Look, I... I... Heh.
我不能有三次失败的婚姻012---I can't have three failed marriages.
我不能  好吗012---I can't, okay?
我不要当那个人012---I am not gonna be that guy.
所以  我们要永远这样下去012---So, what, we just stay married forever?
好  这012---Okay, how...?
说真的  你有什么影响012---How is this going to affect you, really?
我是说  偶尔填表格要打勾时012---I mean, you fill some form out once in a while...
你就勾〝已婚〞那一格012---...instead of checking the box "Miss," you check the box that says, "Mrs."
就在〝未婚〞旁边012---It's right next to it.
好  抱歉  你说得对  我们确实012---Ohh, Okay. I'm sorry, you're right. You know what?
可以维持现状012---We absolutely can stay married, ...
我还以为那两格离得很远012---...because I was under the impression that the boxes boxes were far away from each other.
好  你就012---All right. Look, just...
请你冷静下来012---...please take a moment here...
想一想  你在叫我做什么012---...and think about what you're asking of me. Okay?
我在请你帮我一个忙012---I am asking you to do me a favor.
你是要我当你的老婆012---You are asking me to be your wife.
而身为我的老婆  你应该帮我这个忙012---And, as my wife, I think you should grant me this favor.
那个小孩踢得好用力012---That kid kicked me really hard.
是你扯他的头发012---Well, you did pull his hair.
他拿我的零食  我不想再争了012---He took my snack. I'm not getting into this again.
好啦  说真的  真的很痛012---All right, you know what? Hurts really bad.
我就叫你不要走路  来012---Well, I told you not to walk. Here.
来吧012---There. There. Okay.
这没有任何含意吧  没有012---This doesn't mean anything, does it? No.
好012---Okey.
你怎么可以让人搭便车012---How could you pick up a hitchhiker?
他搞不好是强  强暴犯或杀人犯什么的012---He could be a rape... He could be a rapist or a killer or something.
你以为我没有先问过吗012---Don't you think I asked him that before he got in?
我不理你了  你睡你的觉012---Y’know what? I'm not talking to you. You go back to sleep.

我们登记注册  礼物都给你012---We register and you get to keep all the presents.
不行  罗斯  你听我说012---No, Ross, come on. No, listen.
我一直在想要怎么表达012---look I've thought about how to tell you this, and, um,
罗斯  总之我们不能维持婚姻关系012---the bottom line, Ross...is we cannot stay married.
那可不一定  当然一定012---I don't know if that's true... Oh, but it is.
你知道吗012---Ahem. Okay. You know what this is?
这就叫做意见不合012---This is a difference of opinion.
在婚姻中遇到这种状况  罗斯012---When that happens in a marriage... Oh, Ross, come on!
这不是  这不是婚姻  这是全世界最惨的宿醉012---This is not, this is not a marriage! This is the world's worst hangover!

我有你的住址和电话号码012---Well, I have your address and phone number.

拜托啦  菲比  我受不了了012---Come on, Pheebs, I can't take this anymore.
求求你跟我说话012---Please talk to me.

闭嘴  够了012---Stop it! Stop it! No.
不公平   你明知我无法抗拒  你那美妙的歌声012---That's not fair. You know I can't resist that beautiful voice.
菲比  我真的很抱歉012---Pheebs, look, I am so sorry.
我答应让你旅途愉快012---I know I promised you a fun road trip with your friend...

我们要不要干脆结婚算了012---All right, should we just, should we just get married?
就这么做  反正所有的征兆都叫我们结012---Y’know? I mean should we just do it? All the signs are telling us to do it.
我不想理会什么征兆了012---I'm sick of the signs.

嘿  我去穿毛衣  好012---Okay, um, I'm gonna get my sweater. Okay.
想不想听一件奇怪的事012---Okay. You uh, you wanna wanna hear something weird?
当然012---Always.
我没去办注销012---I didn't get the annulment.
什么  我们还是夫妻012---What? We're still married.
不要告诉瑞秋   待会儿见012---Don't tell Rachel. See you later.
你在干什么012---What are you doing?
钥匙断在钥匙孔里了012---Key is stuck in the lock.
我会修  等下012---I can fix it. Hold on.
让开  让开012---Watch out, watch out.
还是打不开012---It still doesn't work.
我还没弄完  噢012---I'm not finished. Oh.
漂亮   你的技术真好012---Nice job, Joe. You are quite the craftsman.
嗨 嘿012---Hi. Hey.
手续办得还顺利吗012---So, uh, did everything go okay with the annulment?
没问题  都办好了012---Oh, yeah. No problems. It's all taken care of.
罗斯  谢谢你012---Ross, thank you. Ah.
你们要不要去看电影  好啊012---You guys want to go see a movie? Yeah, why not?
我去穿毛衣  好012---Let me get my sweater. Okay.
想不想听件奇怪的事012---You uh, you want to hear something weird?
当然012---Always.
我没去办注销012---I didn't get the annulment.
什么  我们还是夫妻012---What? We're still married.
不要告诉瑞秋  待会见012---Don't tell Rachel. See you later.
你有口香糖吗  有012---Hey, do you have any gum? Oh? Yeah!
等等  罗斯  可以跟你谈一下吗012---Wait! Wait! Hi. Listen, Ross, can I just talk to you for just a second?
但是菲比  电影快开演了012---Oh but Phoebe, we'll be late for the movie.
那里有计程车  计程车012---Oh, there's a cab. Taxi!
太好了012---Oh, that's great.
来得正好  天呐  上车吧012---What timing! My God, huh? There you go.
我们想走着去前面的安洁丽戏院012---Yeah, we’re, we’re actually just gonna walk‘cause it’s right up there at the Angelika.
安洁丽戏院  开车012---Oh, the Angelika! Go! Go!
你没去注销012---You didn't get the annulment?
我知道  罗斯012---I know. Ross!
我试过  但在律师楼我只听到012---Well, I tried, but when I got to my lawyer's office, all I heard was:
"离婚三次  离婚三次"012---"Three divorces! Three divorces!"
我不希望我的墓碑上刻着  "罗斯盖勒  离婚三次"012---Look, I just don't want my tombstone to read "Ross Geller: Three Divorces."
你不必担心那个  你爱刻什么就刻什么012---Don't worry about that. Your tombstone can say whatever you want.
你可以刻  "罗斯盖勒  婚姻高手"012---It can say, "Ross Geller: Good at Marriage."
我的会刻  "菲比布非  活埋在此"012---You know? Mine's gonna say, "Phoebe Buffay: Buried Alive."
反正我不能再添一次失败婚姻012---All I know is, I can't have another failed marriage.
所以你要娶个不知情的女生012---So you're gonna be married to a girl who doesn't even know about it?
女人  抱歉012---Woman. Sorry.
可是  我还没想好要怎么做012---Well, okay, so I don't have it all worked out quite yet.
拜托你先别告诉瑞秋  瑞秋也是我最要好的朋友之一012---Just don't say anything to Rachel. please? Rachel is one of my closest friends.
不过当唯一知情的人感觉不赖  好吧012---Although, being the only one that knows about this makes me feel special. Okay.
停车  菲比012---Okay, Stop, stop! Phoebe?
嘿  瑞秋012---Hey, Rach!
你在搞什么012---What was that?
抱歉  弄错了012---Sorry. Mix-up.
电影好看吗012---Hey, How was the movie?
我还没看012---I haven't seen it yet.
那就赶快去啊  安洁丽戏院  开车  开车012---Well then you’d better hurry! The Angelika! Go. Go!
不012---No!
老友记  第六季  第2集  瑞秋的反应012---Friends  S06E02  The One Where Ross Hugs Rachel
等我们同居  我可以买一台泡泡糖机吗012---Y’know when we move in together, can I get a gumball machine?
当然可以  乔伊不让你买012---Of course. Joey wouldn't let you have one?
对  他对甜食要求特别严012---No, when it comes to sweets, he's surprisingly strict.
你想好要怎么说了吗012---Hey, have you figured out a way to tell him you’re moving out? 
还没  我试了好几次  我只能说出 "乔伊  我得"012---No, no, I keep trying. And I can get out "Joey, I have to--"
然后就退缩改成说  "去上厕所"012---Then I lose my nerve and I finish with "--go to the bathroom."
他可能以为我有病012---He may think I'm sick.
我真的得告诉瑞秋了  早死早超生012---I really have to tell Rachel, but I-We just gotta get it over with.
下次见到他们  我们就说  就这么决定012---Y’know, the next time we see them, we'll just tell them. Okay? That's it.
以后你都要这样指使我  是吧012---That's how it'll work now? You’re just gonna order me around all the time?
差不多  好012---Pretty much. All right.
嘿  摩妮卡 你有没有好一点012---Hey, Monica. Hey, man, you feeling better?
乔伊012---Joey.
我们有事要说012---We have something to tell you.
天哪012---Oh, my God!
你怀孕了012---You're pregnant!
不是  没有吧012---NO! No?
不是  没有012---No. No!
乔伊  是这样的012---Look, Joe, here's the thing. Um--
摩妮卡和我决定  在这里同居012---Monica and I have decided to live together, here.
所以我会搬出来012---So I'm gonna be moving out, man.
哇哦  嘿012---Oh, uh, hey!
我真替你们高兴  恭喜  回见012---I'm really happy for you guys. Congratulations. See you later.
等等  乔伊  你还好吗  很好012---Joey! Joey! Are you okay? Yeah.
我得走了  我还有戏要演012---I gotta go. I've got an acting job.
你们会信才怪012---Like you'd believe that.
真讨厌012---This sucks!
我只是要搬到对面  我保证012---Look, I-I’m just gonna be right across the hall. And I promise you...
摩妮卡和我一分手  我就回去跟你住012---...the minute Monica and I break up, I'm moving right back in.
好  如果你要跟他住012---Okay! Look-look-look, uh, If you're gonna move in with him...
我有责任揭穿他的真面目012---...I feel it is my responsibility to tell you the truth about him.
他是个很烂的室友  很烂012---He's a terrible roommate. Terrible.
他会忘记012---He, uh, forgets to, um...
他老是012---He always, he always, uh...
我骗谁啊  他最棒了012---Oh, who am I kidding! He's the best roommate ever!
菲比  你有看到瑞秋吗  嘿012---Hey, Pheebs. Have you seen Rachel? Hey.
没有  怎样  我有个好消息012---No, why? I have some exciting news.
你怀孕了012---You're pregnant.
不是012---No!
钱德和我决定同居012---Chandler and I are moving in together.
太好了012---Oh, that's good!
不过如果你有宝宝  要叫什么  提示  菲比012---Wow! But now if you were pregnant, what would you name it? Hint, Phoebe.
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
怎么样  嗯012---What's up? Well, um...
钱德和我要住在一起012---Chandler and I are moving in together.
天哪012---Oh, my God.
我妹妹和我的死党012---Oh, my little sister and my best friend...
搞在一起012---...shacking up.
太好了  太好了012---That's great. That's great. Mwah.
喂  我也很高兴  好  起来012---Guys, I'm happy too. Okay, come here.
今天真热闹  有人要同居  有人办注销012---Big day, huh? People moving in. People getting annulled.
我要去找瑞秋了  不过…012---Okay, I gotta go find Rachel. But, um--
你们见着她  能不能先灌些坏消息给她  减轻一些冲击012---if you guys see her could you please try to give her some really bad news so that mine doesn’t seem so bad? 
好的  再见012---Okay, bye.
讲给瑞秋听的坏消息012---Hmm. Something bad to tell Rachel.
坏消息  什么是她的坏消息012---Bad news for Rachel. What could that be?
你能不能别再提了012---Could ya just, could ya just lay off, please?
我的人生很难堪  我应该去住在别人的楼梯底下012---All right? My life is an embarrassment. I should just go live under somebody's stairs.
罗斯  根本没那么严重  离婚三次又怎样012---Ross, It's not that big a deal. So you’ll been divorced three times.
你还是会有  和生活约会012---you’ll still have a life, you’ll go on dates...
才不会  我的约会指数降到谷底012---No! No, I won't. I'll be at the bottom of the dating barrel now.
比我低的只有离婚四次的人012---The only guys below me will be Four-Divorce Guy...
杀人犯012---...uh, Murderer Guy...
和地质学家012---...and geologists.
罗斯  你别傻了  你可爱聪明又体贴012---Ross, you're being ridiculous. Okay? You are cute and smart and sweet.
这比离婚三次重要多了012---and that is much more important than three stupid divorces.
是吗  你交过离婚三次的男朋友吗012---Oh yeah? Have you dated anyone who's been divorced three times?
这样问不公平  离三次婚的人通常都六十了012---that’s not really fair. Y’know? Most guys who have been divorced three times are like 60.
只有你自己在意012---Nobody cares about this except you.
什么难堪啊  都是你在想像012---This embarrassment thing is all in your head.
我证明给你看  过来  干嘛012---Here, I'll show you. Come here. What?
你好  我朋友罗斯即将三度离婚012---Hi. Listen, My friend Ross is about to be divorced for the third time.
但你们会和他约会吗012---But wouldn't you date him?
你们稍候  我去找罗斯来012---And if you wait right here, I'll go get Ross.
嘿  我还以为你是瑞秋012---Hey. Agh. Thought you were Rachel.
我哪里露出破绽了  我得赶快告诉她012---What gave me away? I just tell her,
我已经告诉罗斯和菲比  只剩她了012---I have to get it over with. I told Ross and Phoebe. She's the only one left.
所以大家都知道了  我们确定要同居了012---Okay, so that’s it, everybody knows! It's official. We're moving in together.
不能反悔012---No turning back.
你怕吗  怕吗012---Are you scared? Are you?
不怕012---No.
那是我最可怕的声音  你真勇敢012---That was my scariest voice. You're brave.
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Ugh. Hey.
今天真惨012---The worst day.
你以为自己终于受重视了  结果老板却叫你拉壳儿012---Y’know, you think finally making progress at work, then your boss calls you Racquel.
我进公司前四年  大家都叫我夏拉拉012---Hey listen, for the first four years of my work everybody called me Sha-la-lap...
是真的  我相信012---Seriously. I believe you.
当时正在开员工大会  当然不会有人纠正她012---So, it was right in the middle of a staff meeting so of course no one else wants to correct.
于是大家都叫我拉壳儿012---So everyone's calling me Racquel.
到了下班前   收发室的人已经叫成洛基了012---By the end of the day, the mailroom guys were calling me Rocky.
我还是觉得你很好  很漂亮012---Well, I still think you're very, very nice and very pretty.
什么012---What?
交给你了012---All yours, babe.
瑞秋  过来012---Rachel, come here.
坐012---Have a seat.
好012---0Kay.
听我说  钱德和我012---Listen, urn, Chandler and I...
要一起住012---...are going to live together.
住在这里012---Here.
天哪012---Oh, my God.
真是太棒了012---That's so great!
我真替你们高兴012---I'm so happy for you guys!
真的012---Really?
你真好  还先问我012---And that was so sweet of you to ask.
天哪  我们三个在一起一定会很开心012---Oh my God, The three of us are gonna have such a good time living together!
是啊012---Yes, we are.
钱德  你早上不能慢慢冲澡了012---And Chandler, you’re gonna have to watch those long showers you take in the morning...
因为拉壳儿不能迟到012---...because you know Racquel can't be late.
瑞秋  他会注意的012---Rach. He'll work on that.
好兴奋喔012---Oh. Aw, this is so exciting!
是啊  哇012---Oh, wow.
来敲我的门012---Come and knock on our door
我们等着你012---We'll be waiting for you
看吧   一旦知道内情   就没那么糟了012---See? Once you know the stories, it's not that bad.
第一次  老婆隐瞒性取向  不是我的错012---First marriage: Wife's hidden sexuality. Not my fault.
第二次  宣誓时叫错人012---Second marriage: Said the wrong name at the altar.
有一点点是我的错012---A little my fault.
第三次  怎么能让012---Third marriage: well they really shouldn’t allow you get married...
脸上涂鸦的醉鬼结婚012---...when you're drunk and have writing on your face.
内华达州的错012---Nevada's fault.
你们觉得怎样  谁会没兴趣  谁会不想和他约会012---Okay, So what do you think, ladies? Who wouldn’t be interested? Who wouldn't want to date him?
离婚无所谓   我会和他约会012---Well the divorces don’t bother me, I'd date him.
但他得先恢复自由身012---But not while he's still married.
那你呢  你也想吧012---Okay, what about you?  wouldn't you want a date?
事实上我再也不约会了012---Actually, I'm not dating at all anymore.
我老是看上对我不好的男人012---See, I figured out that I was only dating guys that were like y’know bad for me,
在我解决这个012---So I decided that until I work that--
好吧  好吧  随便啦012---Good. Good. Whatever.
梅格  你呢012---What about you, Meg?
我也不在意离婚的事012---Well, I don't care about the divorces either.
但我不会和他约会012---But I wouldn't date him.
他显然还爱着这个瑞秋012---It's just that he's obviously still in love with this Rachel girl.
什么012---What?
她说  "他显然还爱着这个瑞秋"012---She said, "He's obviously still in love with this Rachel girl."
这话太扯了  没错   瑞秋是我的好朋友012---This is crazy. I mean, yes, Rachel is my good friend.
我过去确实爱过她012---And I have loved her in the past...
但现在  她只是我的妻子012---...but now, she is just my wife.
菲比  帮我说句话好吗012---Phoebe, will you help me out here?
你娶她时  我也以为你爱她012---Well, I thought you loved her when you-when you married her.
我们喝醉了  喝那么多我连乔伊都会娶012---We were drunk! I would've married Joey with that amount of alcohol.
嘿  比乔伊崔比亚尼烂的人多得是012---Hey! You could do a lot worse than Joey Tribbiani!
很抱歉  但是你们错了012---I'm sorry, but you guys are wrong.
我只是不想离三次婚012---I just don't want to be divorced three times.
没错  他以此为藉口012---Yes, and now he's using this three-divorces reason...
不想离婚  因为他爱她012---...because he wants to stay married to her because he loves her.
我必须说  梅格  干得好012---I must say, well done. Bravo, Meg.
好  如果你们这么想012---Okay, Fine! Fine! If this is what you think...
那我就不管了012---...forget about the whole three-divorce thing.
我现在就去找律师办注销012---Okay, I-I’ll go to my lawyer’s office right now and get this marriage annulled. Okay?
因为我一点也不爱她012---She means nothing to me.
一点也不爱012---Noth-Nothing!
现在是你的神经质  让我发毛012---Okay, now I wouldn't date you because you seem a little creepy.
我突然觉得他好有魅力012---I am so attracted to him right now.
我们什么时候要跟瑞秋说实话012---Okay, when are we gonna tell Rachel what is actually gonna happen?
快了012---Soon.
我刚才说不出口  你也看到乔伊多难过012---I just couldn't before. You saw how upset Joey got.
我不忍心伤害  我最好的朋友012---I couldn't do it. She's my best friend.
乔伊也是我最好的朋友012---Joey's my best friend.
我不是吗012---I'm not your best friend?
你自己刚才说012---You just said--!
你当然是012---Of course, you're my best friend.
但请你告诉瑞秋  好吗012---Would you please tell Rachel? Okay.
好啦  至少我现在有准备  好012---All right. At least I'm prepared. Okay.
漂亮  嘿012---Oh, yes. Hey!
嘿  嘿012---Hey, hey
不是给你的  你有不开心吗  现在有了012---They're not for you. Are you upset? I am now.
嘿  室友012---Hey, roomie.
好  再见012---Okay, bye.
瑞秋012---Rash. Ahem.
我有重要的事  要告诉你012---There's something, urn, important I have to tell you.
你怀孕了012---Are you pregnant?
没有  但我要扔掉这件衣服012---No, but I'm throwing this shirt away.
刚才有一些误会012---I think there was a little misunderstanding before.
我说钱德和我想住在一起012---When I said that, uh, Chandler and I wanted to live together...
意思是只有我们两个人012---...we meant alone together.
天哪  真好笑  我居然会误会012---Oh, my God. That's funny. I can't believe I did that.
不  亲爱的  都是我不好012---No, sweetie. You know what? This is my fault.
我没说清楚012---I wasn't clear.
真的很抱歉012---I'm really sorry.
听着  你可以慢慢找房子012---Listen, you take as much time as you need to move out, okay?
一点也不用急012---There's absolutely no rush.
好012---0Kay.
好012---0Kay.
你不吃饼干吗012---Don't you want a cookie?
好啊012---Sure.
谢谢012---Thanks.
需要面纸吗012---Do you need a tissue?
莫妮卡  这是哪里的饼干  我做的012---Monica, Where did you get these? I made them.
天哪   真好吃012---Oh, God, they're so yummy!
回到家你人却不在   感觉一定会很奇怪012---God, it’s gonna so weird like when I come home and you’re not here.
没有乔伊和钱德家了012---Y’know? No more Joey and Chan's.
没有乔和钱家了012---No more J and C's.
"要不要去乔伊和钱德家"  "不行  已经不在了"012---Want to go to Joey and Chandler's? Can't. It's not there.
我只是搬到对面  我们还是可以跟以前一样012---Look, I’m just gonna be across the hall, We can still do all the same stuff.
但以后就不能半夜起来  促膝长谈012---We won't be able to like get up in the middle of the night and have those long talks...
我们的感觉和未来了012---...about our feelings and the future.
我们一次也没做过012---Not once did we do that.
嗨  嘿012---Hi. Hey.
我告诉瑞秋  我们要自己住了012---So I told Rachel that it's just gonna be the two of us.
是吗  她还好吗012---Oh, yeah? Well, how'd she take it?
非常好012---Really well. Yeah.
令人意外的好012---Surprisingly well.
没有哭  也没有生气或难过012---She didn't cry. She wasn't angry or sad.
你很不爽  没把你最好的朋友弄哭012---And you're upset because you didn't make your best friend cry?
我只求一点真情流露012---All I'm asking for is just a little emotion.
我们是六年室友啊012---Is that too much to ask after six years?
我们没你们要好吗012---I mean what? Are-are-are Rachel and I not as close as you guys?! 
没你们开心吗  我不值得她掉几滴泪吗012---I mean, did we not have as much fun? Don't I deserve a few tears?
乔伊一听到  就哭得死去活来012---When we told Joey, he cried his eyes out.
嘿  我才没有哭得死去活来012---Hey! I did not cry my eyes out!
这就像一个时代的结束012---Come on, it's like the end of an era.
再也没有乔兄和钱哥了012---No more J-Man and Channy's!
我一定要问  有谁那样叫我们012---Okay, I gotta ask, who calls us that?
你又结婚了012---You got married again?
对012---Yes.
这是你两年内第二次结婚012---So that's your second marriage in two years?
对   两年两次012---Yes. Second in two years.
总共三次012---Third, overall.
罗斯  我当了二十三年离婚律师012---Ross, I have been a divorce attorney for 23 years...
没有一个客户比你捧场012---...and never have I had so much business from one client.
告诉我怎么回事012---Why don't you tell me what happened?
基本上   瑞秋和我在赌城   我们喝醉了012---Basically, Rachel and I were in Vegas, and we got drunk.
抱歉  她就是你上次结婚012---I'm sorry, is this the same Rachel whose name you said...
叫错的那个瑞秋012---...at the altar in the second marriage?
对   对   对012---Yes, yes, yes. Heh.
但是我并不爱她012---But I do not love her.
噢012---Oh.
这就好多了012---That's better then.
这只是酒醉犯错   我要办注销012---This was just a drunken mistake, and I need to get it annulled.
我懂了012---I see.
你考虑过接受治疗吗012---Have you considered therapy?
我想今天办注销就好了012---I think just the annulment for today.
要填几份表格  简单012---There are some forms to fill out. Easy.
必须有证人证明   你们当时神智不清012---We'll need witnesses who can testify that you were not of sound mind.
没问题012---No problem. Heh.
你和瑞秋得向法官说明012---And we'll need you and Rachel to testify before a judge.
不能不找她吗012---There's no way to do this without her?
我已经告诉她事情都办妥了012---Because I kind of already told her it was taken care of.
当然  你可以这么说012---Of course you did.
罗斯  你和瑞秋都在场  才能办理注销012---Look Ross, you can't get an annulment unless you and Rachel are both there.
那找一个长得像瑞秋的人呢012---What about someone who looks like Rachel?
我会考虑接受治疗012---I will think about the therapy.
嘿   嘿012---Hey. Hey.
我想我们应该开始分东西了012---So, um, I was thinking that maybe we should start dividing up our stuff.
好吧012---0Kay.
没必要拖拖拉拉的012---No point in dragging it out.
我是说你搬走012---Dragging out the long process of you moving out...
我们分开的事012---...and us not living together anymore.
好的012---0Kay.
瑞秋  怎样012---Hey, Rach. Yeah?
这是什么  这个要归谁啊012---What about this? Who gets this?
我不知道我想不想要  它有太多回忆012---See, I don't know if I want it because it might be too many memories.
那是什么  我不知道012---What is that? I don't know.
瑞秋012---Rachel.
大盘子呢  我要你留着大盘子012---How about this? I want you to have the big plate.
谢谢  莫妮卡  我很喜欢这个盘子012---Wow, Monica, thanks. I love this plate.
这样你就会记得我012---Something to remember me by.
你又不是快死了  我只是要搬出去012---Mon, you're not dying. I'm just moving out.
我们还是会常常见面012---We're gonna see each other all the time.
但这是个大转变012---But still, it's a big change.
甚至是一个时代的结束012---The end of an era, you might say.
你还好吗  眼睛都没眨012---Are you okay? You're not blinking.
我很好  我只是在想一个时代要结束了012---I'm fine. I was thinking about how it's an end of an era.
好吧012---Oh, all right.
但老实说  六年应该称不上一个时代012---But y’know I gotta say, I don’t, I don’t think six years counts as an era.
一个时代就是一段重要的日子012---An era is defined as a significant period of time.
我觉得重要  或许你不觉得重要012---It was significant for me. Maybe it wasn't significant to you!
你是怎么了  你刚才怎么了012---What is the matter with you? What is the matter with you?
你为什么没有更不开心012---Why aren't you more upset?
我们要分开了  你不难过吗012---Aren’t you gonna be sad that we’re not gonna be living together anymore?!
你都不会想我吗012---Aren't you gonna miss me at all?
好吧  说出来你别生气012---Monica, all right. But don't get mad at me.
我只是有点难以相信012---It's just a little hard to believe.
难以相信什么012---What's hard to believe?
你们啊  你们就是这样012---I mean, it's you guys. You do this kind of stuff, you know?
你们在赌城说要结婚  又不结了012---You were gonna get married in Vegas, and then you backed out.
我并不认为你们会真的同居  对不起012---I'm not upset because I don't see you going through with it. I'm sorry.
瑞秋012---Rachel.
事情已经确定了012---It's going to happen.
钱德会搬进来012---Chandler is gonna move in here.
但是  你先听我说完012---But I-No, wait. Just let me finish, okay?
这不是在赌城的一时冲动012---This isn't something that we just impulsively decided to do in Vegas.
我们真的想要住在一起012---This is something that we both really want.
我们会住在一起012---And it is going to happen.
是吗012---It is?
真的012---Really?
没错012---Yeah, sweetie.
我们不能再住在一起了012---You mean, we're not gonna live together anymore?
不行了012---No.
嗯012---Well...
天哪  我会好想你012---Oh, my God. I'm gonna miss you so much.
我也是012---I'm gonna miss you.
这是个时代的结束012---I mean, it's the end of an era!
我知道012---I know!
再见  又来了012---Okay, bye. Oh, no.
你去办注销了吗012---So did you get the annulment?
我办不了  我就知道   因为你爱瑞秋012---I couldn't. I knew it. Because you love Rachel.
不是那样的  事情比想像中复杂012---It's not that. Annulments are more complicated--
爱让它变得复杂012---Complicated because of the love.
我不爱瑞秋012--- I… I do, I do not love Rachel..
我现在就去告诉她012---I’m gonna tell her right now about the whole thing ...
好尽快把手续办好012---...so we can get this marriage annulled as fast as possible.
我如果爱她  会这么做吗012---Okay? Would I do that if I loved her?
我现在更确信你爱她012---I've never been more convinced of your love for her.
我对瑞秋没有感觉  好吗012---I do not have feelings for Rachel, okay?
怎么了012---Oh, what's wrong?
摩妮卡和钱德真的要同居了012---Monica and Chandler are moving in here...
我得搬出去  一切都要变了012---...and I have to move out and everything is changing.
过来  别难过012---Oh, my, come here, come here. It's okay.
不会有事的012---Aw, everything's gonna be okay.
谢谢你012---Thank you.
不客气012---Of course.
罗斯和瑞秋结婚了012---So Ross and Rachel got married.
摩妮卡和钱德差点结婚012---Monica and Chandler almost got married.
我们要不要也勾搭勾搭012---You think you and I should hook up?
要012---Oh, we do. Ha, ha.
但不是现在012---But not just yet.
是吗  那是什么时候012---Really? Well, when?
好012---Okay. Um.
首先  钱德和摩妮卡会结婚012---Ahem, well, first Chandler and Monica will get married...
还会发大财012---...and be filthy rich, by the way.
但婚姻会破裂  天哪012---But it won't work out. Wow.
是啊012---I know.
然后我会为钱嫁给钱德012---Then I'm gonna marry Chandler for the money.
你会娶瑞秋生几个漂亮小孩012---And you'll marry Rachel and have the beautiful kids.
太好了012---Great.
接着我们就抛弃他们结婚012---But then we ditch those two and we get married.
我们会有钱德的财产  瑞秋的孩子012---We'll have Chandler's money and Rachel's kids.
监护权很好抢  因为瑞秋酗酒012---Getting custody will be easy because of Rachel's drinking problem.
那罗斯呢012---Ooh, ooh, what about Ross?
我不想多说  不过012---I don't want to go into the whole thing, but, um...
我们吵架  我杀了他012---...we have words and I kill him.
嘿  你看  太不可思议了012---Hey. Hey, check it out. This is unbelievable.
乔伊已经憋气将近四分钟了012---Joey has been holding his breath for almost four minutes.
猪头  你想闷死我啊012---Dude! You trying to kill me?!
菲比  我问你件事  什么事012---Pheebs, I wanna ask you something. Uh-huh, what?
既然我要搬出去  你又这么美丽012---Um, well, since I'm moving out and you're so beautiful...
我搬去跟你住如何012---...how about I move in with you?
太好了  但是狄妮丝怎么办012---Well, that would be great, but then what do we do about Denise?
谁是狄妮丝  我的室友012---Who's Denise? My roommate.
你有室友  对  狄妮丝012---You have a roommate? Yes, Denise. Denise.
你干嘛啊  菲比  这么神秘012---Hey, what is with the secrecy, Phoebe? Huh?
这个狄妮丝  她可爱吗012---And what about this Denise? She cute?
我们怎么会不知道你有室友012---How can you have a roommate that none of us know about?
也许是因为都没人在听我讲话012---Maybe because you never listen to anything I say.
我一天到晚都提起她   狄妮丝012---I talk about her all the time. Denise!
瑞秋  我在想  我那里会多一个房间012---Hey Rach, listen,  I was thinkin’ uh, I'm gonna have an extra room over at my place.
没错  你何不搬来跟我住012---Oh, that's true. Yeah, Why don't you move in with me?
多好啊  我们可以熬夜谈心  看电影012---It'll be great. We can stay up late talking, watch movies.
你知道赤裸星期四的规定吧012---And you know about naked Thursdays, right?
我还是自己找房子好了012---Yeah, yeah, I think I'm gonna find my own place.
我以为赤裸星期四  是我们的专利012---Hey, hey. I thought naked Thursdays was just our thing, man.
老友记  第六季  第3集  爱与不爱012---Friends  S06E03 The One With Ross’s Denial
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
你没办注销  瑞秋怎么说012---So, what did Rachel say when you told her you were still married to her?
那个啊  她还蛮平静的012---Oh, that. Um, she took it really well.
你没说  对吧  没有012---Oh. You didn't tell her, did you? No.
当然没有  因为你爱她  我并不爱她012---Of course not, Because you're in love with her. I am not in love with her.
她在为搬家的事难过012---She was very upset about having to move out.
所以我就没说  免得她更不开心012---So I didn't tell her we were still married, because she'd only get more upset.
我只是以一个朋友的身份安慰她012---I-I just comforted her, As a friend.
什么叫安慰她  也没什么  我抱了抱她012---What do you mean, "comforted her"? It was nothing. I gave her a hug.
拥抱  正是爱的表示012---Aha. A classic sign of love, the hug.
也是友情的表现012---It's also a sign of friendship.
在这里不是  痴情男012---Yeah, not in your case, Lovey Loverson.
那只是个拥抱012---It was a hug.
告诉我   你有没有闻她的头发012---Just tell me this, did you or did you not smell her hair?
闻她的头发   如果有呢012---Smell her hair? Well, what if I did?
九成女性的荷尔蒙散发自头部012---Ninety percent of a woman's pheromones come out the top of her head.
所以女人都比较矮012---That’s why, that's why women are shorter.
好让男人在拥抱时爱上她们012---So that men will fall in love when they hug them.
拜托  罗斯  你还是个科学家呢012---Come on, Ross, you're a scientist.
我是以一个朋友的身份抱她012---I was hugging her as a friend,
又不是把脸埋进她的头发里012---It's not my fault her hair got in my face.
她的头发很多  有一股012---She's got a lot of it, and it smells all, uh...
你知道的  椰子香012---...you know, coconutty.
又怎样么  那不代表我对她有感觉012---What? Oh. It doesn't mean I have feelings for Rachel.
或许我是对椰子有感觉012---Maybe it means I have feelings for coconuts.
好  随你怎么说  但你要小心  瑞秋的心情和你不同012---Okay, whatever you say. But just be careful. Rachel's not in the same place you are.
如果这个心情是指的爱情012---Okay, if the place you're referring to is being in love...
那她和我的心情一样   因为我不是那个心情012---...then she is in the same place as me, because I am not in that place.
好  我听不懂012---Okay, I didn't understand that.
但或许是因为  你讲得是爱的秘语012---But maybe that's because you were speaking the secret language of love.
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
刚才有你的电话  是谁012---Dude, some guy just called for you. Who was it?
我哪知道012---I don't know.
你怎么不 "谢我帮你留言"012---How about "Thanks for taking the message"? Jeez.
听着012---Hey, listen.
等你搬进来   瑞秋的房间就空出来了012---When you move in, Rachel's room's gonna be empty.
要不要来讨论一下  怎么利用啊012---You wanna talk about what we wanna do with it?
当然  好012---Sure. Okay.
我想我们应该弄个漂亮的客房012---I think we should have a beautiful guest room, right? 
有红木雪橇床  床头桌上永远插着鲜花012---...with a mahogany sleigh bed and bedside tables with flowers on them all the time! 
再摆张卷盖式书桌   放上留言卡012---Then we could have a rolltop desk with comment cards...
让客人表达他们的开心012---...so people can tell us how much they love staying here.
之类的  总之我还没有想到太多012---Whatever, you know, I really haven't thought about it that much.
我喜欢这个主意   当然喜欢012---Well, I like that idea, obviously. Ha, ha.
我在想或许可以弄个游戏房  怎么样012---But I was thinking maybe-maybe-maybe it could be a game room, you know?
我们可以买旧的游戏机012---I mean, you can buy old arcade games...
像《太空入侵者》和《小行星》  只要两百元012---...like "Space invaders" and "Asteroids" for $200.
像真正的街机  那些大的  大的一台012---The real ones. The big, big, big ones.
不要012---No.
你的意思是  "天哪  钱德  太有趣的主意了012---Okay, so you mean "no" as in, "Gee, Chandler, what an interesting idea.
我们先讨论再全盘否定"012---Let's discuss it before we reject it completely."
对不起  当然啦012---Oh. I'm sorry. Of course.
确实是很有趣的主意  不过谈过了  还是不要012---Yes. Interesting idea, um, talk about it, but no.
就这样了012---So that's it?
对啊  漂亮的客房不适合放游戏机012---Well, I just don't think that arcade games go in the beautiful guest room.
倒是应该有很多古董才对012---The beautiful guest room's gonna be filled with antiques.
所以《小行星》才适合   那是最古老的游戏机012---Which is why "Asteroids" is perfect. It's the oldest game.
你对漂亮的客房有什么意见012---What do you have against the beautiful guest room
我没有意见012---I don't have anything against the guest room.
尤其是我们认识的人都住在方圆数公尺内012---Especially since everybody that we know lives about 30 seconds away.
你在嘲笑我吗012---Are you mocking me?
我没有在嘲笑你   也没有嘲笑你漂亮的客房012---No, I'm not mocking you or your beautiful guest room.
怎么了012---What's up?
没事  摩妮卡和我吵架了012---Nothing. Monica and I had a stupid fight.
但你们还是要同居吧  对吧  我的广告今天出来了012---But you're still moving in together, right? Because my ad came out today.
"诚征女性室友  不抽烟  不丑"012---"Wanted: Female roommate, nonsmoker, nonugly."
漂亮012---Nice. Ah?
我想说在你之后012---I just figured y’know, after living with you...
换个女室友想着还挺有趣的012---...it'd be an interesting change of pace to have a female roommate.
一个我可以学习   和我不一样的人012---You know? Someone I could learn from. Someone who's different than me.
谁和我最不一样   年过十九的男人012---And what's more different than me, a guy who's not 19...
还是十九岁的女孩012---...than, say, a girl who is 19?
我可不是草包  朋友012---Not just a hat rack, my friend.
菲比  我想问  嘘  我正在忙012---Pheebs, I have to ask you-Shh. I'm swamped right now.
你只是在发呆012---You're just staring into space.
我想移动那支铅笔012---Um, I'm trying to move that pencil.
这支吗  成功了012---This one? It worked!
菲比  找房子真是恶梦012---Pheebs, this whole apartment thing is a nightmare.
我租得起的地方都有怪胎室友012---Every place that I can afford comes with a roommate who is a freak.
你看嘛012---Look at this.
"诚征女性室友  不抽烟  不丑"012---"Wanted: Female roommate, nonsmoker, nonugly."
没房子了  纽约都住满了  等等   这里有012---it's just there's nothing. This city is full. Wait, no, look at this.
"两房两卫  不抽烟012---"Two-bedroom, two-bath. Must be nonsmoker.
拜撒旦者可"012---Satan worshipers okay."
不过是一楼012---Oh. Yeah, but it's on the ground floor.
嘿   嘿012---Hey. Hey.
瑞秋  你还在找房子  对  怎样012---Rach, are you still looking for a place? Yeah, why?
好  我们博物馆有个华伦012---Okay, there's this guy Warren from the museum...
要去参与挖掘工作两年时间012---...and he's going on a dig for like two years.
他有个漂亮的家要转租012---And he's got this great place he needs to sublet.
你有兴趣吗012---So you interested?
听起来好棒  我愿意住华伦家   我爱华伦012---That sounds great. I'd love to live at Warren's. I love Warren.
谢谢你  别谢我012---Thank you. Oh, don't thank me.
要谢就谢那座火山吧012---You wanna thank someone, thank the volcano...
几千年前爆发012---...that erupted thousands of years ago...
毁灭却也保存了整个文明012---...killing but perfectly preserving an entire civilization.
这是华伦的电话012---Here's Warren's number.
太好了  我现在就打给他012---Oh, this is great. I am gonna call him right now.
噢  好  谢谢你012---Oh, okay. Oh. Thank you. Ha, ha.
好  快去吧012---Okay, you go call him.
我看到了012---I saw it.
我不知道你在说什么012---I don't know what you're talking about.
我在说你知道却不肯承认的事012---I'm talking about that which you already know but won't admit.
你又爱上她了  你重复爱她012---You know, that you love her again. You relove her.
真的  我没有重复爱她012---Look, I do not relove her.
你居然这么嘴硬012---I can't believe you won't just admit it.
总之  你千万别做蠢事012---Okay, just promise me that you won't do anything stupid.
我们现在只是朋友  我为什么要做蠢事012---Look, we're just friends now, okay? Why would I do anything stupid?
房子已经租出去了012---Ugh. Well, the apartment is already subletted.
没希望了  我找不到房子了012---I mean, this is just hopeless. I'm never gonna find anything.
你可以来跟我住012---You can live with me.
什么  什么012---What? What?
怎么样012---What?
天哪  你是说真的吗012---Oh, my God, are you serious? Uh-huh.
我求之不得  太好了  谢谢你012---I would love to live with you, Ross. That's great. Thank you.
很高兴  能帮到你就好012---I'm just glad I could, you know, help you out.
我都替你们高兴  这真是太聪明了012---Wow, I'm so happy for you guys. This is so, so not stupid.
罗斯  这对我太重要了012---Ross, Ross, you have no idea what this means to me.
我差点就要流落街头  你救了我  你是我的英雄012---I mean, I was gonna be homeless. You've just saved me. You're my hero.
说英雄就太那个  好吧012---Hero? I don't know. Well, all right.
我要去告诉摩妮卡  她的哥哥有多棒012---Oh. I have to go tell Monica what a wonderful brother she has.
别这样  拜托012---Aw. Mwah. Oh, please.
你又有话要说了吧012---You're gonna say things now, aren't you?
没有012---No. No, I won't.
但是我告诉你012---But I should tell you this.
我的室友狄妮丝就是这样的012---This exact same thing happened to my roommate, Denise.
她搬去跟一个偷娶她的人住012---She moved in with a guy...
他嘴上说不爱  其实很爱她012---...who was secretly married to her and said he didn't love her but really did.
后来事情爆发012---and it just blew up!
所以她才搬来跟我住012---And that's how she ended up living with me.
好吧  我骗你的012---Okay, that's a lie.
嗨  嗨012---Hi. Hi.
刚才很抱歉   我不需要游戏房012---Hi. Listen, I'm sorry about before. I don't need to have a game room.
我以前找不到女孩才去打游戏的012---When I was a kid, I only played those games because I couldn't get girls.
现在我得到了012---Now I can get--
现在我有了你012---Now I have you.
不  我并不是把你当成012---No, not that I think that I have you...
或者想成一件财产012---...or think of you as property in any sort of way.
我对女人  别再说了  钱德012---I see women-Stop it, Chandler.
我也很抱歉012---I'm sorry too.
真的  对012---Really? Yeah. Oh, yes.
当然012---Oh.
我们不必去弄一个客房012---Listen, we don't have to make that a guest room.
我们可以一起想想  要怎么利用  好主意012---we can think of something to do with the room together. That's a great idea.
要做到皆大欢喜很容易012---We can easily think of a way for us both to enjoy the room.
就是啊012---Totally.
我们不必现在就想  好吧012---We don't have to come up with this now. Oh, good.
不如来想想  客厅要怎么变化012---Hey, y’know what? Why don't we think about changes that we can make in the living room?
变化012---Changes?
对  我们得移动一些家俱  来放我的椅子012---Yeah, I mean, we're gonna have to move some furniture to make room for my chair.
你要把懒人椅搬过来012---You're gonna bring the Barcalounger over here?
有问题吗  嗯012---Is that a problem? Well...
那是一组的  应该摆在一起012---It's just that they're a set and they should probably stay together.
那好  那我就统统搬过来012---Oh, that's cool. Then I'll just bring them both over.
你是要它们离开老家012---See, now you're taking them away from their home.
好  我懂了  这里没我的东西  只有你的东西012---Okay, I get it. So I get nothing. Nothing here is mine. Everything is yours.
我早上起床  就穿上你的衣服   然后去上班012---I'll get up in the morning, put on your clothes, and head off to work.
没错  这里  这是我说的012---Yeah. Yeah, you know what? That's it. That's it.
只有我的东西  没有你的012---Everything will be mine. Nothing will be yours.
拜托  我是在讲懒人椅012---Oh, come on. Chandler! I'm talking about the Barcalounger.
它跟这里不搭  你要摆哪里012---It just, It doesn't match. Where is it gonna go?
游戏房里012---In the game room.
你的椅子丑到爆  又不是我的错012---Look, it is not my fault that your chairs are incredibly ugly.
好  我不搬椅子过来  我什么都不搬过来012---That's fine. That’s fine! I won't bring over the chairs. I won't bring anything over.
我可不想破坏老奶奶家的调调012---I wouldn't wanna ruin the ambiance over here at Grandma's place!
你的条件看起来很好啊012---Everything on your application looks really good.
最后一个问题012---Oh, just one last question.
你和你朋友  会不会常来这里狂欢聚会012---Are you and your friends gonna be over here all the time like partying and hanging out?
放心  我不太爱玩012---Oh, don't worry. I'm not really a party girl.
嗯012---Whoa.
别想都不想就说012---Now, don't just be blurting stuff out.
我要你想清楚再答012---I want you to really think about your answers.
你不必找室友了  你好  我要住在这里012---You can call off the roommate search. Hi. I'll be living here.
别理他012---Oh, don't listen to him.
他很想住进来012---He's just some guy who wants the apartment.
但我不会选他012---But I don't think he's gonna get it.
你干嘛把浴帘拿掉012---Why did you take the shower curtain down?
那个东西很危险012---That thing was a hazard.
我很注重安全012---I'm very safety-conscious.
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
我正在清理些空间给你012---Oh, I was just clearing some space for your stuff.
谢谢012---Oh, thanks.
但我刚去找了摩妮卡012---But listen, I was just at Monica's...
她和钱德大吵了一架  不同居了012---...and she and Chandler had a big fight and they're not moving in.
什么叫不同居了  他们还是要同居吧012---What do you mean, not moving in? They're still moving in, right?
不  他们为了怎么利用空房间   大吵了一架012---No, no, they just had a big blowout over what to do with my room.
就为了一个烂房间012---What? Over a stupid room?
我也有点替他们可惜012---y’know，I feel kind of bad for them...
但是又很高兴  可以不必搬过来了012---...but I'm also really psyched because I don't have to move in here.
没错  这一点的确很棒012---Oh, no. Yeah. No, that part's great.
你们两个是在吵什么012---What's all this about you guys fighting?
真的就为了一个房间嘛012---Is this really over a room?
那真是太傻了012---I mean, that is so silly.
罗斯  我们自己可以摆平  显然不行012---Ross, we can handle this. Well, apparently not.
我不能坐视两个我关心的人012---And I can't just stand by and watch two people I care about so much...
为了这么傻的事伤感情012---...be hurt by something that is so silly.
别再傻了  你叫她别傻啊012---I mean, enough of the silliness. Why don't you tell her to stop being silly?
好  好012---Okay, okay.
双方都有理012---Two very good points.
我认识你们两个很久了012---Look, I've known you both a long time.
你们在一起之后012---And I've never seen either of you one-millionth as happy...
比以前快乐一百万倍012---...as you've been since you got together.
你们真的要为了一个房间   放弃这一切012---Do you really wanna throw that all away over a room?
太傻了啊012---That is so silly.
什么比较重要  爱情012---What's more important, love...
还是傻气012---...or silliness?
我们喜欢傻气012---Well, we are fond of the silliness.
但面对爱情也会心软012---But we also have a soft spot for the love.
爱是万灵药  欢笑才是吧012---Love is the best medicine. That's laughter.
你为什么这样  我不知道012---Why do you do it? I don't know.
好了  钱德  你想跟摩妮卡住吧012---Now, Chandler, you wanna live with Monica, right?
对  我想啊012---Yeah, I do.
摩妮卡  你想跟钱德住吧012---And, Mon, you wanna live with Chandler, don't you?
对012---Yes.
很好  口头契约  在纽约州有约束力012---Good. A verbal contract is binding in the state of New York.
我听说你在找房子012---So I understand you're looking for a place?
不  我不搬了012---No, no, I'm staying put. Oh.
我本来打算找你来我家住012---I was going to offer you my apartment.
那为什么  你要去哪里012---Why? Where are you going?
我不知道012---I don't know.
嘿  瑞秋  嗨012---Hey, Rach. Hi.
说了你一定不信  钱德和摩妮卡又要同居了012---Uh, you're never gonna believe it. Monica and Chandler are moving in again.
真是太好了  对他们来说  对吧012---That's great news, right? I mean, for them, right?
对啊012---Oh, wow.
不过好处是  我们又能当室友了012---But on the bright side, we get to be roommates again.
是啊  关于这件事012---Yeah. You know, about that, um...
我很感谢你主动提议012---Ross, ahem, I really appreciate your offer to let me move in and everything...
但是你不觉得会很怪吗012---...but don't you think it's gonna be weird?
为什么  为…为什么会怪啊012---Why? Why? Why would it--? Why would it be weird?
因为我们012---Well, you know, because of us.
我们的过去012---Because of our history.
不会  不会吗012---No. No?
不  不会012---No, no.
除非我们还余情未了012---It would only be weird if we were still in that place.
你还余情未了吗012---I mean, are you still in that place?
一点也没有  很好  我也没有012---No, not at all. Good. Me neither.
那就没问题了012---So it's not a problem.
我们只是刚好是室友的朋友012---We're just two friends who happen to be roommates.
好  但我们迟早会约会012---Okay, but, Ross, eventually, you and I are gonna be dating.
是吗  我们吗012---Really? We are?
是啊  我会有男朋友  你会有女朋友012---Well, yeah. I'm gonna have a boyfriend and you're gonna have a girlfriend.
哇哦012---Oh. Heh.
那太好了012---That'd be great.
不过如果你觉得无所谓  我们就想一套做法012---But if you think it's gonna be okay, we'll just work out a system.
就像大学时代   我在门上挂个牌子012---It'll be like in college. I'll hang a hanger on the door and put a sign:
"暂且回避  正在炒饭"012---"Come back later. I'm getting lucky."
我想都没想过012---Yeah, I didn't think of that.
你们确定要住在一起012---So are you sure about this whole moving-in thing?
这是很大的进展   急什么呢012---I mean, it's a really big step. And what's the rush?
真好笑012---That's very funny.
他在装傻  因为他知道我们喜欢傻气012---He's being silly because he knows we enjoy the silliness.
不  我是说真的  你们想想012---No, I'm serious, okay? I mean, think about it.
你搬进来  你们为了游戏房的事吵架012---You move in, you start fighting over stupid game rooms...
接下来就会分手012---...next thing you know, you break up.
罗斯  你说得对  吵那种架真的很蠢啊012---Ross, you were right before. It was just a stupid fight about a room.
一点也不蠢012---Okay, there are no stupid fights.
重点不是房间012---This isn't about the room.
而是房间代表什么012---This is about what the room represents.
很不幸的  这个房间会毁了你们012---And unfortunately, this room could destroy you.
我没那么担心  我也是012---Yeah, I'm not so worried. Yeah, no, me neither.
好吧  这是你们的人生012---Fine. It's your life.
我只是不想看到你们分手012---I just don't wanna see you break up. y’know 
你们要是同居就会分手012---Which you will do if you move in together.
但你们想这样  我也没办法012---But if that's what you want, there's nothing I can do.
不要同居012---Don't do it!
你还是想搬进来吧  当然012---You still wanna move in together, right? Of course.
罗斯没吓到你吧012---Ross didn't scare you?
吓得我死也不敢跟他住012---Scared me out of ever wanting to live with him.
过来  我给你看样东西  好012---Come here, I gotta show you something. Okay.
天哪  正方形人被杀了012---Oh, my God, someone's killed Square Man.
我觉得懒人椅可以放这里012---This is where the Barcalounger could go.
你可以看电视  离厨房又够近012---You see, you can see the TV, and still, it's walking distance to the kitchen.
真周到012---Oh, that's so sweet.
我也有事要说  好012---I wanna show you something too! Okay!
你知道道路会合的标志吧012---You know those big-big uh, road signs that say "merge"?
我想我们可以弄一个012---You know? So I was thinking we could get one of those signs...
挂在床头上012---...and hang it over our bed.
因为你和我就是那样012---Because that's you and I together.
合而为一012---"Merge."
天哪  我好喜欢啊  真的012---Oh, my God, I love that. Really?
才怪012---"No."
谢谢012---Thank you.
如果想收到我的演出电邮讯息012---If you wanna receive e-mails about my upcoming shows...
请捐钱给我   让我买电脑012---...then please give me money so I can buy a computer.
嗯012---So, uh... Ahem.
其他人呢012---Where are the other guys?
摩妮卡和钱德在忙012---Well, let's see, Monica and Chandler are occupied.
吵架  不  是忙别的012---Fighting? No, the other thing.
真高兴他们能和好012---I really think it's great they worked things out.
谁也别想拆散他们  对吧012---Yeah, there's no breaking them up, is there?
可以跟你借钥匙去配一副吗   当然可以012---Hey, can I borrow the key to your house so I can make a copy? Sure!
拿去  谢谢012---Here. Thank you.
你确定吗012---Now, are you sure?
配了钥匙  就不能反悔了012---Because once I make a copy, there's no turning back.
我确定012---Yeah, I'm sure.
趁我改变心意前快去吧012---Now get out of here before I change my mind.
听着  罗斯012---Uh, listen, Ross.
跟瑞秋住真的好吗012---do you really think this moving in with Rachel is a good idea?
我也在摇摆不定012---I've been back and forth.
也许你应该摆回去012---Yeah, well, maybe you should go back, okay?
瑞秋搬进去012---Rachel moves in, and before you know it...
不知不觉间  你们就又复合了012---...you're where you don't wanna be, back together.
应该不会012---Yeah, I don't think so.
她已经在谈交男朋友的事了012---She's already talking about, you know, dating other guys.
不会有结果的012---That's not gonna work out.
她会哭着回家  你会告诉她012---Then she's gonna come home all weepy, and you'll be telling her:
"没关系   你会找到好男人"012---"Oh, that's okay. You'll find someone."
接着砰  她找到了你012---And then, barn, she finds you.
也许你说得对012---Huh. Oh, maybe you're right.
她绝对会再爱上你  这样你也愿意吗012---I am telling you, Ross, she is definitely gonna fall in love with you again.
是你想要的嘛012---Now, is that what you want?
是我想要的嘛  是的012---Heh. Is that what I want? Yes.
她来了  我来替你省点事012---Here she comes. I'm gonna make your life much easier.
五金行打烊了  改天再打012---All right, well, the place was closed, I’ll just copy it later.
或是别打了012---Or not.
瑞秋  你就搬来跟我住嘛012---Uh, Rach, why don't you just move in with me?
乔伊  等等  没关系012---Whoa, whoa, Joey. No, no, no. It's okay.
瑞秋  我知道赤裸星期四把你吓跑了012---I mean Look, Rach, I know I scared you off with that whole naked-Thursdays thing...
但是我们也可以不做012---...but we don't have to do that.
搬到对面确实比较轻松012---Well, it would be easier to move just right across the hall.
慢着  除非你想改成赤裸星期三012---Wait a minute, unless you're thinking about naked Wednesdays.
你不喜欢星期四  那就挑一天012---Thursday's clearly not good for you. Pick a day.
嗨  嗨012---Hi. Hi.
请进  谢谢你再跑一趟012---Come on in. Thanks for coming back.
有很多人想租012---Okay, there have been a lot of people interested in the room.
但我经过筛选  你是最后人选之一012---But I have narrowed it down, and you are one of the finalists.
太好了  在做决定之前012---Great. Okay, now, before I make my decision...
我想确定一下  我们合不合得来012---...I just wanna make sure that our personalities match, okay?
所以我发明了一个小测验012---So I made up a little test.
我说一个词  你就说出第一个联想012---Now, I'm gonna say a word, and then you say the first thing that comes to mind.
没问题  好  那我们开始012---I can do that. Okay, here we go.
枕头  仗012---Pillow. Fight.
很好012---Very good.
好  丁字012---Okay. G.

好012---Okay. Um...
狗012---DOQQV -
猫  很抱歉012---Kitten? Ooh, sorry.
就差那么一点点  再见012---No, no, no. So close, though. But, you know, okay, bye-bye.
摩妮卡  厨房有哪些东西是我的012---Monica, which of all of this kitchen stuff is mine?
这个开罐器012---This bottle opener.
还有呢  还有上面的磁铁012---And...? And it's a magnet.
你看012---Look at that.
多巧啊  你要搬来跟我住012---How weird is that? You know, you're moving in with me...
而我就缺一个开罐器012---...and you have the one thing I don't have. Ha, ha.
彷佛是你让我变得完整012---It's like, in a way, you complete me. Huh?
我是说厨房  什么012---Kitchen. What?
你让我的厨房变得完整   室友012---You complete me kitchen, matey.
罗斯  我知道你在想什么  什么012---Ross, I know what you're thinking. What?
她搬去跟你住之后012---That she's gonna move in with you...
或许会爱上你012---...and then maybe fall in love with you, and then...
等她发现你们还有婚姻关系  就会很高兴012---...when she finds out you're already married, oh, she'll be happy.
你真的很悲哀012---You know? You're just-You're very sad.
我的天哪012---Oh, my God.
我终于知道了  你爱上瑞秋了012---I see what this is. You are in love with Rachel.
什么  没错  这就对了012---What? Of course. It all adds up.
你迷恋她012---I mean, you're obsessed with her. It's always:
"罗斯  瑞秋的事怎么办"012---"Ross, what are you gonna do about Rachel?
"罗斯  你为何要跟瑞秋住"012---Ross, why are you moving in with Rachel?
"你何时要承认没办注销"012---When are you gonna confess your secret marriage to Rachel?"
你想要她  乱讲012---You want her. No!
电话救了你一命012---Uh-oh. Saved by the bell.
你好012---Hello.
瑞秋  这对烛台不是我的吗012---Hey, Rach. Aren't these Candlesticks mine?
不   那是我买的012---No, no, I bought those.
对喔   我忘了  对012---Oh, right. I forgot. Yeah.
忘了你是个骗子012---That you're a liar.
不会  太好了  我星期一过去  再次谢谢你012---No, no, that's great. I'll be there Monday. And thank you again.
好的012---0Kay.
是纽约大学   古生物学的012---Um, that was the head of the paleontology department...

他…说…什么012---Wow. What did he say?
记得我那篇沉积速率论文吗012---Uh, remember that paper I had published last year on sediment flow rate?
他们很喜欢  有谁会不喜欢012---Well, they loved it. Well, who wouldn't?
就是嘛012---I know!
总之   他们要聘我当客座教授012---Anyway, they asked me to be a guest lecturer.
是暂时的  但表现好就可能转任正职012---I mean, it's temporary, but if they like me, it could lead to a full-time job.
标在信箱上可帅了  盖勒教授012---How great would that look on the mailbox, huh? Professor Geller.

嘿  嗨012---Hey. Hi.
嘿   怎么了012---Hey. What's the matter?
嗯012---Well, ahem.
我不是在看巫师（通灵的或有特异功能）吗   是啊012---You know that psychic I see? Yeah?
她说我这个星期会死012---She told me that I'm gonna die this week...
所以我有点沮丧012---...so I'm kind of bummed about that.
什么  对   我知道你们不太懂通灵术012---What? I know you don't know about readings...
但这应该算是最糟糕的预言了012---...but that one is pretty much the worst one you can get.
菲比   这也太夸张了012---Phoebe, that's crazy.
她居然咒你死012---I can't believe she'd say that to you?
亲爱的  你不会相信吧012---Yeah, honey, you don't believe her, do you?
我不知道  她预言过我会生三胞胎012---I don't know. She, you know, said that I'd have triplets...
但她也说会有一个黑宝宝012---...but she also said one of them would be black.
纯属好奇啊   她有提到死法吗012---Just out of curiosity, did she tell you how you were gonna go?
没有   她到最后才告诉我012---No, because she didn't tell me I was gonna die till the end of the session.
我不想再跟她多耗一小时了012---And I was not gonna waste a whole other hour there.
我只剩下一星期了012---I mean, I've only got a week left, you know?
我得开始享受人生了012---I've really gotta start living now.
大家好  嗨012---Hey, everyone. Oh, hi.
嘿   我今天第一次上课012---Hey. Hey. Well, today's my first lecture...
想找你们演练一下  可以吗012---...and I kind of wanted to try it out on you guys. Do you mind?
好啊   没问题012---No, that'd be great.
好吧012---0Kay.
沉积速率有三个主要理论012---"There are three primary theories concerning sediment flow rate.
每一个还可以细分为两个012---Each of these theories can be further subcategorized into two"
我就是这样死的012---Oh, this is it. This is what's gonna kill me.
类别  第一个是012---"Subcategories. The first of these subcategories is"
罗斯012---Um, Ross? Heh.
你那张纸上有裸女吗012---Are there, uh, naked chicks on that piece of paper?
没有  怎么了012---No. Why?
我没见过纸上没有裸女012---Well, I just never seen a guy stare so hard at paper...
男人还会死盯着看012---...that didn't have naked chicks on it.
好  好012---Oh, okay. Okay.
沉积速率012---"There are three primary theories...
有三个主要理论012---...concerning sediment flow rate.
每一个还可以012---Each of these theories...
细分为两个012---...can be further subcategorized into--"
不如以笑话来开场012---Why don't you open with a joke?
以笑话开场   那是大学啊   不是喜剧俱乐部012---Open with a joke? It's a university, not a comedy club.
等一下  且慢012---Wait a minute, hold the phone.
是咯咯窃笑大学吗012---You're not talking about Chuckles University?
好012---0Kay.
开玩笑的啦012---Ohh! We’re kidding! Come on, we're kidding.
你知道怎么搞才会比较有趣吗012---hey you know what might make it less boring?
谢谢你012---Thank you.
运用影像辅助012---Some, um-Some visual aids.
你知道  哪种影像辅助最好吗012---Oh, oh! You know what's a good visual aid?
别跟我说裸女012---Please don't say naked chicks.
为什么不行啊012---Why not?
我真不知道干嘛要找你们商量012---I don't even know why I bothered to even talk to you guys about it.
我自己解决   不必用裸女012---You know, I'm just gonna do it on my own, with no naked chicks.
我十九岁之前就是那样012---That's the way I did it till I was 19.
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey

"保险中止"   太奇怪了012---"Benefits lapsed." Hmm. That's weird.
我不记得演过这部片子012---I don't remember being in a movie called Benefits Lapsed.
这不是支票012---Okay, it's not a check.
信上说由于你去年工作的不够012---They're saying your health insurance expired because...
你的医疗保险过期了   我看看012---...you didn't work enough last year. Let me see that.
好012---All right.
不会吧012---Oh, I can't believe this.
好烂喔012---This sucks.
有保险时   我可以被车撞012---When I had insurance, I could get hit by a bus...
或是被火烧012---...or catch on fire, you know?
我都无所谓   现在却得小心了012---And it wouldn't matter. Now I gotta be careful?
真可惜   被火烧这种事012---I'm sorry, man. There's never a good time to have to...
停了总是不好012---...stop catching on fire.
好吧012---All right, well...
我得找工作了  我去见经纪人012---...I guess I gotta go get a job. I'm gonna see my agent.
过马路要小心左右来车012---Okay, make sure to look both ways before you cross the street.
"过马路要小心左右来车"012---"Make sure to look both ways before you cross the street."
嘿   菲比  你还活着012---Hey. Hey, Pheebs, you're still alive.
感觉如何012---How are you feeling?
等死好累啊012---It's so exhausting, waiting for death.
对了   你能不能012---Oh, by the way, do you think you--
菲比  你干什么012---Pheebs, what are you doing?
我在替你做心理   你没有以为我死了吗012---I was preparing you for-Didn't you think I was dead?
我装得不像吗012---Did that not come off?
真像啊  吓死我了  我还以为我们永别了012---Oh, yeah, scared the hell out of me. I thought we'd lost you forever.
菲比  你要不要睡下  好  谢谢012---Pheebs, you wanna lie down? Yeah, thanks.
对了  帮我一个忙012---And listen, can you do me a favor?
两个小时后叫我012---Could you just wake me up in a couple hours.
如果还能叫得醒的话012---You know, if you can.
摩妮卡012---Monica?
这是你摆回去的012---Did you take these back?
不  不是  我很喜欢  就去买了一对012---No-no, I-I just, I liked them so much that I went out and bought some for myself.

想耍诈012---Nice try.
哈罗   课上得怎样012---Hello. Hey, how'd the lecture go?
很顺利啊012---It went great.
既不需要笑话   也不需要裸女012---And I didn't need any jokes or naked chicks either.
太好了  抱歉之前没有好好帮忙012---Oh, that's great. I'm sorry we weren't supportive before.
我就知道   教材充实最重要012---I knew all I had to do was let the material speak for itself.
每个人都说  "你得表现的既风趣又性感"012---Everyone's all, uh, "Ross, you have to be funny and sexy."
我证明他们错了012---Well, I proved them wrong.
我现在就去告诉乔伊和钱德012---And now I'm gonna pass the news on to Joey and Chandler.
说你既不风趣也不性感   没错012---That you're not funny or sexy? That's right.
伊斯特  听着  哇012---Hey, Estelle, listen-Well, well, well.
乔伊崔比亚尼012---Joey Tribbiani.
回来了  是吧012---So you came back, huh?
每个人都以为走比较好  但最后012---They think they can do better, but they all...
还不都爬回来求伊斯特012---...come crawling back to Estelle.
你在说什么012---What are you talking about?
我哪有离开  你一直是我的经纪人012---I never left you. You've always been my agent.
是吗  是啊012---Really? Yeah.
我没恶意   你别在意012---Oh, well, no harm, no foul.
伊斯特  你得帮我找工作  我的医保没了012---Look, Estelle, you gotta get me some work. I lost my health insurance.
好  首先我们得做伤害控制012---All right, first thing we gotta do: damage control.
为什么  我觉得012---Why? Well, I think, uh...
可能有人012---...someone out there...
在到处中伤你012---...may have been bad-mouthing you all over town.
不要脸012---The bastard.
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
明天伊斯特帮我排了一堆试镜012---So Estelle lined up a bunch of auditions for me tomorrow.
我很快就能重新加入医保012---And I'll have my health insurance back in no time.
太好了  但你现在应该去蹲马桶吧012---That's great, but shouldn't you be on the toilet right now?
什么  你是怎么了012---What? What's wrong with you?
没什么012---Nothing.
我刚才举哑铃时  肚子突然一阵剧痛012---Well, I got this blinding pain in my stomach when I was lifting weights before.
然后就昏倒了012---And then I, uh, passed out...
而且一直就站不起来012---...and, uh, I haven't been able to stand up since. Ha, ha.
不过  应该没什么012---But I don't think it's anything serious.
这应该是疝气   你得去看医生012---This sounds like a hernia. You have to-Go to the doctor.
我才不要012---No way.
就算要去看医生012---If I'm gonna go to the doctor for anything...
也是因为肚子这里突出来012---...it's gonna be for this thing sticking out of my stomach.
那就是疝气012---That's a hernia.
我为什么要恢复健身呢012---Why'd I have to start working out again?
烂哑铃012---Damn you, 15s.
我们提早到了  还要十五分钟才会开始012---We're a little early. The lecture doesn't end for 15 minutes.
对   但我们可以偷偷溜进去看  是啊012---Yeah, but we can sneak in and watch. Yeah. Good.
你看  是姊妹会的人012---Oh, hey, look. There's some Kappa Kappa Deltas.
我以前也是会员  嘿  姊妹们012---I was a Kappa. Hey, sisters.
哇  我们以前真是犯贱012---Wow, we really are bitches.
好   瑞格比  从实验室012---Right. So when Rigby got his samples...
取回样本后012---...back from the laboratory...
有了惊人的发现012---...he made a startling discovery.
他原以为那是火山物质   其实  是沉积物012---What he believed to be igneous was, in fact, sedimentary.
他的惊愕012---Imagine his consternation when--
糟糕012---Oh, bloody hell.
你在搞什么啊012---What the hell are you doing?
我很紧张012---Look, I was nervous.
你们害我担心  我会很无聊的012---You guys had me all worried I was gonna be boring.
我上了台   学生都盯着我看012---I got up there and they were all, like, staring at me.
结果我一开口  满嘴的英国腔012---I opened my mouth and this British accent just came out.
而且还很锉012---Yeah, and not a very good one.
别再说了012---Will you, please...?
盖勒博士   我是寇特拉斯曼012---Dr. Geller? Kurt Rathman.
古生物学系教授012---I'm a professor in the paleontology department here.
可以聊聊你的课吗012---Do you have a moment to talk about your lecture?
抱歉了   我和我妹妹有约012---I'm sorry, I've got plans with my sister.
摩妮卡 盖勒012---Monica Geller.
是的  失陪一下012---Right. Will you excuse us for one moment?
你干什么012---What are you doing?
你能装  我就不能装了012---You can have an accent, but I can't?
小伙子  早啊012---Top of the morning to you, laddies.
别闹了012---Would you just please stop?
是的012---Yes.
这个季节的孟买   气候非常怡人012---Bombay is very, very nice this time of year.
帮我点个小煎饼012---Hey, will you grab me a cruller?
坐下啦012---Sit down.
拜托你去看医生  大哥  疝气手术012---Will you go to the hospital? Dude, hernia operations cost, like...
应该很贵吧012---...a lot probably, okay?
而且  它越来越黑  越来越痛012---Besides, it's getting darker and more painful.
就表示在好转012---That means it's healing.
我借你钱012---Look, I will loan you the money.
赶快去医院  把它012---Just go to the hospital and let's just get that thing...
塞回去012---...pushed back in.
谢谢  但我要很久才能还你钱012---Thank you, but it'd take me forever to pay you that money back.
我又不想惦记这件事012---And I don't want that hanging over my head, okay?
而且  只要医保恢复012---Besides, as soon as my insurance kicks in...
我就可以动各种免费手术012---...I can get all the free operations I want.
我打算先去做眼睛的雷射激光手术012---I think I'll probably start with that laser eye surgery.
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
嘿  怎么了012---Hey. What's going on?
乔伊的疝气很严重012---Well, Joey's got a bad hernia...
不过动了个眼睛雷射手术就好了012---...but it's nothing a little laser eye surgery won't fix.
真的   我跟你讲  把手压在这里012---Look, I'm telling you, if I put my hand on my stomach right here...
就不痛了012---...it doesn't hurt that bad. Ah.
搞不好你会死012---Hey, maybe you'll die.
钱德   我怕了012---Chandler, I'm scared.
我们可以一起走012---No, we can go together.
但不要拖的太久012---Just don't wait too long, though...
因为星期五之前我就会挂掉012---...because I'm out of here sometime before Friday.
但是我不想死012---But I don't want to die.
不  会很好玩的012---No, no. It'll be fun.
我们可以回来   吓吓他们012---We can come back and we can haunt these guys.
给我  不要   这是我的012---Give me them. No, they are mine.
是你偷我的  你才偷我的012---You stole them from me. You stole them from me.
拿来012---Give me them.
要不要一人一个012---You just wanna each take one?
很公平   反正也没用过012---Yeah, that seems fair. We never use them.
听着  你们真的得帮我012---Look, I really need some help, okay?
为什么   为什么我要说英国腔012---Why? Why did I have to speak in a British accent?
我该怎么办012---What do I do?
慢慢的把口音改掉012---Well, why don't you phase it out? Yeah, phase the accent out.
别人会以为你在适应美国生活012---People will think that you're adjusting to life in America.
是啊  根本不会有人注意012---Yeah, I mean, come on. No one will even notice.
搞不好根本没人在听012---I mean, they're probably not even listening to you.
没人在听我讲话012---They're not listening to me?
当然有在听你讲话012---Of course they're listening to you.
每个人都在听你讲话012---Everybody listens to you.
莫妮卡  你真的觉得我该慢慢改吗012---Monica, do you really think I should try this phasing-out thing?
我觉得你很帅啊012---I think you look fine.
好了  开始了  好012---Whenever you're ready. Okay.
提米012---Hey, Timmy.
我要给你一个012---I've got a surprise...
惊喜012---...for you.
停   抱歉012---Hold it. I'm sorry.
这个惊喜是一组新秋千  别演得这么凝重012---The surprise is a new swing set. If you could play it less intense.
好的   没问题   等我一下012---Oh, yeah. Sure, no problem. Just hold on one second.
嘿  提米012---Hey, Timmy.
我要给你一个惊喜012---I've got a surprise for you.
天哪012---Oh, my God!
所以我都喂我的狗吃跑路012---So that's why I feed my dog Purina One.
今天就去搬一包吧012---Pick up a bag today.
这时候你要把它搬起来  没错012---That's where you pick up the bag. Exactly.
不是  台词是"搬一包"   所以你得把它搬起来012---No, the line is, "Pick up a bag," so you need to pick up the bag.
或是用指的012---Or I could just point to it. Huh?
跑路   跑路  今天就去指一包吧012---Blah, blah, blah. Purina One. Point to a bag today.
我没过   对吧  没有012---I didn't get it, did I? No.

预言错了   我不会死了012---My reading was wrong. I'm not going to die.
真的  你怎么知道   因为我的预言巫师死了012---Really? How do you know? Because my psychic is dead.
她一定是看错牌了  我很遗憾012---She must have read the cards wrong. Oh, I'm sorry.
总比我死好012---Ah, better her than me.

谢谢你陪我来012---And, hey, thanks for coming with me.
还有谢谢你帮我洗澡012---And thanks again for helping me take a shower.
这样叫 "绝口不提"吗012---Now, is that "never talking about it again"?
乔伊   都准备好了012---Hey, Joey. We're ready for you.
这是亚历   他演你的儿子012---Joey, this is Alex. He's gonna be playing your son.
你好  亚历012---Hi, Alex.

"好好照顾你妈"   你就要哭  懂吗012---"Take good care of your mama, son," that's your cue to cry. Got it?
好的   来吧012---All right, let's do this.

抱歉  乔伊  你把衣服掀开来012---I'm sorry. Hey, hey. Joe, why don't you lift up your shirt?
小鬼你看这里012---Take a look at this, kiddo.
有个小孩哭了  摄影机  快拍012---We have a crying child! Roll the damn cameras!
喂   罗斯在吗012---Hello. Hello, is Ross there?
他不在   你要留言吗012---No, he's not. Can I take a message?
好   我是罗斯的离婚律师012---Yes, this is Russell, Ross' divorce lawyer.
我一直没有他的回音012---Just tell him that since I haven't heard from him...
他应该是想试着经营这段婚姻012---...I assume he's decided to give the marriage a try.
罗斯又结婚了  不会吧012---Ross got married again? Aah! No.
好吧   继续   慢慢改掉口音012---All right, keep going. We are phasing the accent out.
改掉口音012---Phasing it out.
要不是进实验室重新化验结果012---"So without retesting their results in the laboratory...
研究小组也不会发现012---...the team would never haveidenfified".
原先的碳14定年结果有误012---...the initial errors in their carbon dating analysis."
到这里有问题吗012---Were there any questions at this point?
请说  你的口音怎么没了012---Yes. What's happening to your accent?
再说一次  你说什么012---Come again? What's this nonsense?
好吧   我不是英国人012---All right. I'm not English.
我是长岛人012---I'm from Long Island.
我一紧张  就会冒出012---I was really nervous, and the accent...
那个腔调了012---...just, um-Just came out.
很抱歉012---Ha, ha. I'm sorry.
回到课堂上来012---So if we could just get back to the lecture.
有任何问题吗012---Um, were there any questions?
古生物学的问题012---About paleontology?
我只是想留下良好的第一印象012---All right, look, I was just trying to make a good first impression.
很显然  我搞砸了012---Obviously, I screwed up.
但你们对我的看法很重要012---But what you guys think of me is really important...
因为我想成为专职教授012---...because I'm hoping to get a permanent job here.
如果你们愿意再给我一次机会  制造好感012---So if you'd just give me another chance to make a good impression--
罗斯  你疯了吗012---Ross. Are you crazy?
我还是你的老婆  你想瞒我一辈子吗012---I am still your wife? What, were you just never gonna tell me?
你是哪里有病012---What the hell is wrong with you?
我真想宰了你012---Ugh, I could just kill you!
瑞秋  你好012---Well, hello, Rachel.
你真的玩过了  真的012---You've really done this before? Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
你就用力打下去  用力  好012---You just take a big, big swing, okay?
不要手软012---Now, don't hold back.
嘿   嘿012---Hey. Hey.
你们在干嘛012---What are you doing?
庆祝乔伊的医保恢复了012---We're just celebrating that Joey got his health insurance back.
好012---Oh, all right.
你居然没告诉我  我们还是夫妻012---Oh, I cannot believe that you didn't tell me we are still married.
我这不是正准备告诉你么012---Look, I was going to tell you.
什么时候   第一个私生子出生后012---When? After the birth of our first secret child?
罗斯没办注销   我们还是夫妻012---Ross didn't get the annulment. We are still married.
什么  我的天哪012---You're kidding? Oh, my God.
罗斯012---Ross.
或许这个决定不太好012---Okay, maybe it wasn't my best decision...
但我无法面对另一次失败婚姻012---...but I couldn't face another failed marriage.
我插个嘴012---Let me just jump in and ask.
你觉得这段婚姻哪里成功了012---At what point did you think this was a successful marriage?
瑞秋  别这样  其实想想  还蛮好笑的012---Rach, come on. If you think about it, it's actually kind of funny.
还是不要想好了012---Okay, maybe it's best not to think about it.
这真是不可原谅   我真是震惊到了极点012---Oh, this is inexcusable. I'm shocked to my very core.
菲比  我已经说你知道了012---Phoebe, I told her you already knew.
又在骗人  你真的有病012---Another lie. You have a sickness.
罗斯   我只是随便问问012---Ross, just for my own peace of mind...
你没娶我们其他人吧012---...you're not married to any more of us, are you?

我回到家才发现012---Well, I didn't realize till I got home.
我才不要光着一只脚再回来012---I wasn't gonna walk all the way back down here with one shoe.
我要去找那辆车  然后留言012---I'm gonna go find that guy's car and leave a note on the windshield.

什么  什么012---Whoa, whoa, whoa. What?
拜托  法兰克他们012---Please, please, please? Frank and Alice...
托我带小孩  我好紧张  我一个人没带过012---...asked me to baby sit the triplets and I’m nervous ‘cause I’ve never done that before by myself!
放心  菲比  我们一定会帮忙012---Don’t worry about it Phoebe, we’ll absolutely do it.
我就不了  如果是狗狗我就很犹豫了012---Yeah, I'm gonna pass, because I was kind of iffy when it was puppies.
好啦  钱德  这是练习的好机会啊012---Come on, Chandler. Come on, it'll give us great practice for when...
总会有客人带小孩来012---...people with babies come to visit.
好车012---Nice car.

我现在应该要发狂才对啊012---Wow, I could so easily freak out right now.
那我呢012---What about me?
我刚发现狄妮丝要出远门  我没室友了012---I just found out Denise is leaving town for a while. I don't have a roommate.
也许我可以当你的室友  菲比012---Well, maybe I could be your roommate, Pheebs.
也对啊  可以啊012---Maybe you could be my roommate.
有办法了  没错012---Well, there's an idea. Yeah.
太好了012---That would be great. Oh.
狄妮丝要去多久  她说她12月26日回来012---Wait, how long is Denise gone for? Um, she said she'd be back December 26th.
12月26日012---Oh! December 26th.
也许她是圣诞老公公012---Heh, maybe she's Santa Claus.
看  是谁  我老公  我的心肝宝贝012---Oh, look who it is. My husband, the apple of my eye.
我已经约好明天2点出庭012---Okay, I got us a court date for tomorrow at 2...

你知道吗  我实在是012---Ross, you know what? I just got--
你为什么要这样  我说过012---Why? Why did you do this? Look, I told you--
我不想听 "三次失败的婚姻"012---I don't wanna hear "three failed marriages."
如果你失败过两次  就会了解了012---Look, if you'd had two failed marriages, you'd understand.
多亏了你   我现在只差一次012---Well, you know what? Thanks to you, I'm half way there.
我快气死了  罗斯  我从来没有这么气过012---Oh, I am so mad, Ross. I don't think I've ever been this angry.

小女生钱德   我在哪里听过   对了  鲁本教练012---Little Baby Girl Chandler. Where have I heard that before? Oh, right, Coach Rubin.
菲比012---You know what, Pheebs?
等你那边忙完  我们这里也有状况了012---When you're done over there, we've got a kind of situation over here too.
不行  自己的小孩要自己照顾012---Uh-uh. No. We are all responsible for our own babies.
那你就错了  我们一直采取人盯人战术012---See, that's where I think you're wrong. We've been playing them man-to-man.
但我们应该打区域联防的012---We should really be playing a zone defense.
什么意思012---What do you mean?
我觉得一人守一区012---I just think things will go smoother...
会比较顺畅   菲比  你可以负责擦屁屁012---...if we each have our own zone, you know? Phoebe, you can be in charge of wiping.
摩妮卡  你负责包尿布012---And, Mon, you can be in charge of diapering.
我就负责看他们抓着我的手012---And I can be in charge of looking at how cute they are when they put their hands...
好主意  也许你才应该擦屁屁012---That sounds really great, but you should be in charge of wiping.
我是菜鸟   不该守球门区012---Okay, I'm a rookie. I should not be in the end zone.
哇啊哦  真好012---Wow, this is so great.
餐厅都应该这样准备餐点的012---This is exactly how we set the plates at the restaurant.
是吗  我可不是点的这个012---Yeah? Well, this is not what I ordered.
大家好  嗨012---Hey, guys. Hey.
宝宝们好012---Hey, babies.
早上真过瘾012---I'm having the best morning.
钥匙在我这儿的那辆保时捷  还在012---That, uh, Porsche I've got the keys to? Still there.
不会吧  毕竟钥匙在你手上012---Shocking, since you still have the keys.
你应该看看  大家对我的态度012---You should see the treatment I get when I'm with that car.
每个人都很友善  找我聊天  而且不只是聊车子012---People are friendly. They wanna talk. And not just about the car.
还有人教我投资策略012---One guy advised me on my equity investments.
什么投资策略012---What equity investments?
赚到保时捷的股票投资  你跟上好吗012---The ones that got me the Porsche. Will you keep up?
但要是我光杵在那里012---I figured, if people keep seeing me just standing there...
别人会觉得那不是我的车012---...they're gonna start to think I don't own it.
所以我要洗车  摩妮卡  你有水桶和肥皂吗012---So I figure I'll wash it, right? Monica, you got a bucket and some soap?
有  我有肥皂  海绵  抹布012---Oh, yeah. I got soap and sponges and rags...
亮光腊和打腊工具组012---...and carnauba wax and polishing compound.
你根本没有车012---You don't even have a car.
对  但是有一次  楼下停过一辆很脏的车012---I know. But one time there was this dirty car parked in front of the building...
我就把它给洗了012---...so I washed it.
还有呢  还有另外六辆012---And? And six others.
这就对了012---There you are.
它可以飙到130012---Yeah, she tops out at 130. Wow.
这还是在市内  出了市区到上州可以飙到160012---And that's just in the city. I get her up to 160 upstate.
是吗  你在上州也有房子012---Really? You got a place upstate?
当然012---Sure.
改天见  好  慢走012---Well, I'll see you later. Okay. Take it easy.
喂  那是我的车012---Hey. That's my car.
是吗012---Really? Oh, uh...
再给我5分钟012---Just give me five more minutes.
你在干什么012---What are you doing?
我捡到钥匙  现在帮它打腊012---Well, I found the keys, and now I'm just polishing her up.
但这是我的车  这是我的腊012---But it's my car. Yeah, but it's my wax.
听着  我很少进市区012---Listen, I don't come to the city much.
我不知道你是疯子  还是在演街头剧012---And I don't know if you're crazy or if this is some kind of street theater...
但请把钥匙还给我012---...but could I have my keys?
拿去  我帮你占了车位012---Sure. Yeah. I'll save your parking spot.
我不回来了012---I'm not coming back.
为什么  我住在上州012---Why not? I live upstate.
是啊  我本来也是012---Yeah, so did I.
我之前不晓得在紧张什么012---I don't know why I was so nervous about this...
法兰克他们为什么会抱怨  带孩子太容易了012---...and I don't know why Frank and Alice are always complaining. This is so easy.
是啊  2小时和一辈子能一样嘛012---Yeah, two hours, a lifetime, that's the same.
你们看  宝宝醒来后012---Check it out. Check it out. When the babies wake up...
可以认识克洛格012---...they can meet Krog.
你在干什么   那个东西会害人的012---What are you doing? That thing could put someone's eye out.
不止害人  他还能毁灭宇宙012---He can do more than that. He can destroy the universe.
不  钱德  宝宝可能会误食那些零件012---No, Chandler, they could swallow one of those little parts.
而且  那个光滑的部位  会误导他们012---And also, look at his smooth area. That's just gonna mess them up.
他们才不会误食什么  你们这叫保护过度012---They're not gonna swallow anything. You're too overprotective.
我小时候   我妈都把我扔在碎玻璃堆里012---When I was a kid, my mom used to just throw me into a pile of broken glass.
什么  玻璃  沙子  还不都一样嘛012---What? Glass, sand, whatever.
小莱丝莉边睡边伸懒腰012---Oh, look at little Leslie stretching in her sleep.
好可爱喔012---Oh, it's so cute.
不知道要到几岁  才没办法把腿举到头上012---I wonder what age it is when you stop putting both legs behind your head.
我现在还是可以012---Oh, I can still do that.
你怎么会还没结婚012---How are you still single?
好吧   我想或许你们说得对012---All right, ahem. I thought about it, and maybe you're right.
或许克洛格不够安全012---Maybe Krog is not a safe toy.
你为什么改口了  我吞了音波死光枪012---Good. What made you change your mind? I swallowed his sonic blaster gun.
怎么会这样012---How did that happen?
我想证明我是对的012---Well, I was trying to prove that I was right, you know?
结果   我错了012---And it turns out I was wrong...
现在它还卡在我的喉咙里012---...and now it's lodged in my throat.
真是的  我们光顾着带小孩012---Damn it, this whole time we were concentrating on the babies...
都忘了要看着钱德了012---...and no one was watching Chandler.
两位  要申请注销婚姻012---Okay, you two are asking the court for an annulment?
是的  申请表  都填好了012---Yes, Your Honor. And here are our forms, all filled out.
根据申请书所言012---So based on your petition...
你申请注销的理由是012---...you are seeking an annulment on the grounds...
盖勒先生的精神状况不稳定012---...that "Mr. Geller is mentally unstable."
好  我精神状况不稳定012---Fine. I'm mentally unstable.
而且  他使用静脉注射毒品012---And based on the fact that "Mr. Geller is an intravenous drug user."
什么  是的  海洛因与快克012---What? Uh, yes. Heroin and crack.
快克根本不是静脉注射毒品012---Crack isn't even an intravenous drug.
你当然知道012---Well, you would know.
这上面还说012---Now, it also says here that you:
"你在婚前隐瞒性向"012---"Lied about your sexual preference before marriage."
拜托  罗斯  我发现那些杂志了012---Oh, come on. Ross, please. I found the magazines.
还有  你"无法履行夫妻间的义务"012---And, finally, that you were "unable to consummate the marriage."
这也难怪  你是同志  又打海洛因012---Well, that makes sense since you're gay and addicted to heroin.
很抱歉  这也太夸张了012---Okay, you know, I'm sorry, this is insane.
我没有打海洛因  我不是同志012---I'm not addicted to heroin, I'm not gay, and there is no problem...
我履行什么都没问题012---...with my ability to consummate anything.
我现在就可以在这里履行  现在012---Look, I'll consummate this marriage right here, right now.
没有这个必要012---That won't be necessary.
我们交往时  简直跟兔子有得一拼012---And when we were dating, we consummated like bunnies.
如果你们曾经认真交往  那就有问题了012---Now, if you two were involved in a serious relationship, that really creates a problem.
大人  我们2年前就分手了012---Your Honor, rest assured, that relationship ended two years ago.
可以删掉 "跟兔子有得一拼" 吗012---And can you please strike "consummated like bunnies" from the record.
这份申请书有任何实话吗012---Is there anything in this record that is actually true?
有  我们确实在赌城结婚012---Uh, well, yes. We got married in Vegas.
名字应该也没错012---And, uh, the names, I think.
好吧  但从刚才的话来听012---Well, based on what I've heard...
两位不符合注销资格012---...you two certainly don't qualify for an annulment.
如果你们不想在一起   就必须办理离婚012---If you don't wanna be together, you'll have to file for divorce.
太好了  你高兴了吗  都是你的搞笑表格害的012---That's great. You happy now? Look what you did with your funny, funny form.
什么  我的表格   你那句"跟兔子有得一拼"呢012---What? Me? What about you and your "consummated like bunnies" nonsense?
那  你打什么打012---And what--? What are you typing that for?
你没听到嘛  我们不能办注销了012---She already said we don't get the annulment.
不要打了012---Don't type that. What--?
别再打了012---Stop typing. Hey.
别再打了012---Stop typing.
别打了  "别打了"012---Stop typing, "stop typing"
你看你  让我嫁的是什么人啊012---Okay, okay, do you see what you're keeping me married to?
请两位离开我的办公室012---You need to get out of my chambers.
好  你给我听着012---All right, lady, here's the deal.
我是来办注销的  没办成我绝对不走012---I came here for an annulment, and I'm not leaving here until I get one.
你们想在牢里过夜吗   耽误您了012---Would you like to spend the night in jail? Thank you for your time.
保时捷的主人把车开走了012---That Porsche guy took his car back.
但你捡到的是他的衣橱钥匙012---But you found the keys to his clothes?
不是  我只是012---No, I just, uh...
我只是喜欢  大家以为我有保时捷的感觉012---I love the way it feels when everybody thinks I own a Porsche.
你穿这样   别人就会以为你有了012---People would think you own a Porsche because of the clothes?
那当然012---Of course.
白痴才会没车还穿成这样子012---Only an idiot would wear this stuff if he didn't have the car.
那倒是012---That is true.
不过应该只有天才  才会误食音波死光枪012---Yeah, but only a genius would swallow a sonic blaster gun.
我也误食过012---Oh, I've been there.
我要去开我的保时捷了012---I am gonna go drive my Porsche.
乔伊   你知道你没有保时捷吧012---Joey, you know you don't actually have one.
拜托  你搞什么  我正在入戏   你说说她012---Come on. What are you doing? I'm in character. Will you talk to her?
感觉它动了  它真的在戳我啊012---Ah, I think it just moved. It's really poking me.
够了  我们去挂急诊012---That's it. We're going to the emergency room.
什么  不  你们不能把我扔给他们  我们正在带孩子012---What? No, you can't leave me here with them. We're babysitting.
宝宝都睡了  你撑一下应该没问题啊012---The babies are asleep. I'm sure you'll be okay on your own.
但你们不能把我扔给他们  我们是一队的012---But you can't leave me with them. We're a team.
在打区域联防  他们会以三打一012---We're playing a zone. They're gonna triple-team me.
他的喉咙卡了个塑胶玩具  我们必须去医院啊012---He's got something plastic in his throat. We gotta go to the hospital.
但医生也帮不了他  反正012---But, no, because a doctor won't be able to help him. And it's just gonna, you know...
过个7年就会自动排出012---...naturally pass through his system in, like, seven years.
那是口香糖   我确定是死光枪012---I think that's gum. I'm pretty sure it's gun.
听着  真的很痛啊  我们走吧012---Okay, listen, this really hurts. Let's go.
男子汉才不会冲去医院012---But no. A real man wouldn't just run to the hospital.
克洛格会怎么做012---No. What would Krog do?
泊车小弟怎么还没  把我的保时捷开来012---Why isn't that valet back with my Porsche?
也许因为钥匙在你手上嘛012---Maybe because you've got the keys?
都是你的错  我的错  你威胁法官012---That was totally your fault. My fault? You threatened the judge.
你把书记员的打字纸撕下来012---Well, you ripped the paper out of the court reporter's machine.
那样才能让他打不下去012---That was the only way I could get him to stop typing!
盖勒夫妇好吗012---Hi. How are the Gellers?
不要那样叫012---Don't call us that.
法官不准我们办注销  我们只能去办离婚了012---The judge wouldn't let us get an annulment. Now we gotta get a divorce.
你被保捷附身了吗012---Did a Porsche throw up on you?
嘿012---Hey
是"保时捷"啊012---It's "Porsche."
我完全可以照顾你们  对吧012---Me taking care of you is no problem, huh?
你们觉得很安心吧012---You guys feel safe, right?
吐泡泡就表示〝安心〞012---Okay, I'm gonna take that spit bubble as a "Yeah, I do."
我扔了脏尿布  就帮你换一块干净的012---Let's get rid of this dirty diaper, Leslie. I'll set you up with a nice clean one.
抱歉  我不是故意的  我得先清理一下012---Okay, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you. I just have to clean that up, okay?
这是摩妮卡的家012---Because, let's face it, we're at Monica's.
破了  反正东西迟早都会坏012---I broke it. All right. Well, that's just the way things go.
好  就这样012---Okay. Good.
为什么只剩两个012---Why are there only two of you?
莱丝莉呢012---Where's Leslie?
你们不会说话  莱丝莉  你在哪里012---Well, you can't answer. Leslie? Where are you, Leslie?
莱丝莉  现在是开口说话的好时机012---Leslie, now would be a good time for your first words.
你看看你012---Well, look at you.
嘿012---Hey.
你有点点调皮喔  真是的012---You are a little bit mischievous. My gosh.
是非常皮012---Oh, you're a lot mischievous.
反正会干的012---Well, it'll dry.
去跟哥哥妹妹躺在一起012---Okay, you sit with your brother and sister now...
他们不在012---...who aren't there.
你还好吗012---Hey. How do you feel?
再过12到14小时  克洛格就又能012---Well, let's just say that Krog will be equipped to destroy the universe again...
毁灭宇宙了012---...in 12 to 14 hours.
我一个人把孩子都带好了012---Okay, so I totally took care of the babies all by myself.
喂奶  洗澡  哄他们睡觉012---I fed them, bathed them and put them to bed.
还保护他们躲过龙卷风012---And protected them from a tornado?
我的天哪012---Oh, my God.
对啊  宝宝都睡了012---I know. The babies are asleep.
菲比  家里是怎么了012---Phoebe, what happened here?
我做到了  我一个人照顾宝宝012---I did it. I took care of the babies all by myself.
但是我的房子  成了菲比胜利的战场012---But my apartment. Was the setting of Phoebe's triumph.
但是这里乱的012---But the mess.
比起菲比的辛劳实在不算什么012---Is not as important as the fact that Phoebe took care of the babies all by herself.
你说得对  我不该大惊小怪012---You're right. You're right, I shouldn't freak out.
等我们有了孩子  也会这样012---‘Cause this is what will happen when you and I have babies!
那得等到什么时候呢012---When will that be?
菲比  你看你弄得多乱012---Phoebe, would you take a look at this mess?
亲爱的  你总算回来了  我都开始担心了012---Oh, honey, thank God you're home. I was getting worried.
我去领了离婚证书012---I picked up the divorce papers.
该签的我都签了 你要签的地方我也画了叉012---Uh, I've already signed everything. And I put little X's where you need to sign.
画叉  真好  这样就前嫌尽释了012---Oh, little X's. Great. That makes up for everything.
你也干过很多蠢事  好吗012---You know, you've done a lot of stupid stuff too, okay?
有哪一件事情跟这次一样蠢012---Oh, name one stupid thing that is as stupid as this one.
你飞去伦敦阻止我结婚怎么说012---Okay, how about you flew to London to stop my wedding?
我已经结婚了  你还说你爱我012---How about you told me you loved me after I was married?
慢着  那不一样012---Wait a minute, that was different.
我做那些事  是因为我爱你012---I did those things because I was in love with you.
正是012---Yeah. Right.
你说得对  的确很不一样012---You're right. That's very different.
总之赶快签一签吧012---So let's just sign the papers.
怎样  没事了012---What? Nothing.
请签名012---Okay, can we just sign, please?
恭喜你012---Congratulations.
罗斯   等一下012---Okay, wait, Ross. Wait a minute. Um...
我有一件事要坦白012---I, uh, kind of have a little confession.
什么事012---What?
你知道  结婚这件事012---Uh, well, you know, this whole marriage thing.
算是我的主意012---Kind of my idea.
什么012---Excuse me?
我们不是醉到那天晚上的012---Well, remember how we were too drunk to remember anything...
什么事都想不起来012---...the night we were married?
怎样012---Yeah?
我很不想说012---And yeah, I didn't really wanna say anything...
但是我的记忆一直回来012---...but it just kind of kept coming back to me.
记不记得  我们在赌场012---Um, remember, we were in the casino...
你突然觉得   狂吃葡萄会很好玩012---...and for some reason, you thought it'd be funny to eat a lot of grapes.
然后我觉得  我们结婚一定会更好玩012---And I thought it would be funnier if we got married.
于是我们折衷  先去结婚012---So, ahem, as a compromise, we decided first to get married and then...
然后再去吃很多葡萄012---...(Ross joins in) to eat a lot of grapes.
因此012---So, um...
抱歉  惹出这些麻烦012---Sorry I got us into this whole thing.
所以  仔细想想012---So then, I mean, if you think about it...
这一切都是你的错012---...this is all your fault.
不要得寸进尺012---Yeah, don't push it, though.
我知道012---I gotta say...
我跟很多女人离过婚012---...I know I divorce a lot of women.
却从来没想过会跟你离婚012---Never thought I'd be divorcing you.
我知道012---I know.
我总觉得要是我们结婚   一定会天长地久012---I always thought if you and I got married, that would be the one that stuck.
不会是秘密结婚012---And it wouldn't be a secret...
更不会在必胜客请吃酒席012---...and we wouldn't have our wedding dinner at Pizza Hut.
我有请客吗012---Did I even treat?
没有  那是免费的  新婚夫妇特惠012---No, it was on the house. It was a newlywed special.
我没听过这么令人沮丧的事012---That may be the most depressing thing I've heard in my life.
我去律师那里送件012---Well, I should probably get these to my lawyer's office.
谢谢你  罗斯  把事情都办妥了012---Hey, thanks, Ross, for taking care of all this.
不客气012---Ah, no problem. Yeah.
我要份副本  没问题012---I'm gonna need a copy of those. Totally.
嗯012---Yeah.
嘿   嘿   别在我的保时捷旁边乱跑012---Hey, hey, hey. Careful around my Porsche.
乔伊  嘿012---Hi, Joey. Hey.
你们好吗012---How you doing?
他有一辆最拉风的保时捷012---He has the most amazing Porsche under there.
我很想给你们看看  但我刚刚哄她睡着了012---I'd love to show you, but I just tucked her in. She's sleeping.
嘿  两位  要不要去喝杯酒啊012---Hey, would you two girls like to go for a drink?
好012---Okay. Aah.
我要搬过去了  房租就给你缴了012---Listen, I'm gonna be moving out, so you are gonna be in charge of paying the rent.
也对  什么时候要缴  每月1号012---Right, and when is that due? First of the month.
是每个月吗012---And that's every month?
不是  你想住的月份才要缴012---No, just the months you actually want to live here.
啊012---Ah.
这是电话费012---Okay, here's the phone bill.
天啊  要死了012---Oh, my God!
那是电话号码012---That's our phone number.
是我突然决定要搬走的012---Look, I know I kind of sprung this whole me-moving-out-on-you thing.
所以我先帮你挡一阵子吧  不  不  不  不行012---So why don't I just cover you for a while? No, no. No way.
乔伊崔比亚尼不接受施舍012---Joey Tribbiani does not take charity...
再也不了012---...anymore.
这不是施舍  乔伊  不行  别再说了012---It's not charity, Joe. No, forget it.
谢谢  但我不想再拿你的钱了012---Okay? I mean, thanks, but I'm done taking money from you.
我可以照顾自己  还有什么012---All right? I can take care of myself. Now, what's next? Come on.
好  这是电费012---Okay, uh, here's the electric bill.
用个电要这么多钱  对啊012---This is how much we pay for electric? Well, yeah.
其他的帐单  待会儿再看了012---So we'll do the rest of the bills later, then?
老友记  第六季  第6集  最后一夜012---Friends  S06E06  The One With Joey's Porsche
那乔伊得搬出去吗012---So is Joey gonna have to give up the apartment?
希望不用  我想给他钱  但是他不收012---I hope not. I tried to offer him money, but he wouldn't take it.
你觉得他需要多少012---How much do you think he needs?
我想1千5应该够他活几个月了012---I figure $1500 would cover him for a few months, you know...
但我得骗他收下  免得伤到他的自尊012---...but I have to trick him into taking it so I don't hurt his pride.
你怎么不雇他当演员啊012---Yeah. Well, why don't you hire him as an actor?
你可以叫他装扮成演短剧   怎样都行012---You could have him dress up and put on little skits whenever you want.
那样对自尊确实有帮助012---Well, that would help the pride thing.
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
你真是响当当啊  明天要不要搬来跟我住012---Wow, you look great. Do you wanna move in with me tomorrow?
好啊  好012---okay. okay
你们女生今晚要做什么012---What do you girls have planned for tonight?
与其难过我和瑞秋要分开012---Instead of being sad that tonight's my last night with Rachel...
还不如我们出去吃饭庆祝012---...we thought we'd go out and celebrate:
瑞秋要搬去跟菲比住012---Rachel's moving in with Phoebe.
还有我的生日  今天不是你的生日012---And also my birthday. Ha, ha.It's not your birthday.
你这样讲好恶劣012---What a mean thing to say.
我就不会戳穿你012---I would never tell you it was not your birthday.
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
你们男生有什么节目吗012---Hey, so you guys have anything planned for the big last night?
与其一起打混   我们决定什么也不做012---Well, instead of just hanging out, we figure we'd do nothing.
今晚是《尼克队》开慕战012---Whoa, whoa, whoa. Knicks' season opener tonight.
我以为你们想来我家看012---I thought maybe you guys would come and watch it.
不知道  罗斯012---I don't know, Ross.
我怕你又吹嘘  说你放弃打球012---Not if you talk about how you gave up basketball...
去当古生物学家了012---...to become a paleontologist.
我本来就放弃了打球  去当古生物学家012---I did give up a career in basketball to become a paleontologist.
菲比  我在想  你还没换衣服012---Pheebs, I was wondering. You're not dressed yet?
我们15分钟后就要去玩了012---We're supposed to start having fun in 15 minutes!
而且  早1分钟都不行012---Well, and clearly, not a minute sooner.
瑞秋  你都打包好了吧  拜托  你说是012---Rachel, you are packed, though, right? I mean, please tell me you're packed.
我当然打包好了  莫妮卡  别紧张啊012---Of course I'm packed. Monica, relax.
我只是想问问菲比  我该穿什么012---I wanted to ask Phoebe for her opinion on what I should wear.
天哪  我真是一刻也不得闲012---My God, I cannot get a minute of peace.
我的天哪012---Oh, my God.
摩妮卡会宰了你012---Monica's just gonna kill you.
我知道012---I know.
你穿这样蛮适合惨死的012---What you're wearing is fine for that.
你没打包012---You're not packed!
你根本没打包012---You're not packed even a little bit.
惊喜012---Surprise.
什么  你别发飚啊  是这样的012---What? Don't get mad, because, look, this is what happened.
我开始打包  然后想到  "我在干嘛"012---So I started packing, and then I realized, "What am I doing?"
我最不会打包了  对吧012---I am lousy at packing, right?
但你最爱打包了012---But you love packing.
所以做为我的临别赠礼012---So as a gift to you on our last night...
我可以当总指挥012---I'll be coordinator.
天啊  对不起  我没帮你准备礼物012---Oh, my God, I'm so sorry. I didn't get you anything.
哦012---Oh.
大家都要帮忙  菲比  你可以帮忙吧012---Look, everybody has to help. Phoebe, you can help, can't you?
我有事012---I have plans.
你是跟我们有约  没错012---You have plans with us. That's right.
钱德可以贴纸箱  罗斯封箱  乔伊搬东西012---All right. Chandler can make boxes, Ross can wrap, and Joey can lift things.
菲比  去通知男生帮忙  好012---Tell the guys they have to help out. Okay.
天哪   谢谢你012---Okay. My God, thank you.
快逃   摩妮卡要叫你们收东西   她把工作都分好了012---Hurry! Monica's gonna make you pack. She's got jobs for everyone.
我是躲不掉了  你们快逃012---Now, it's too late for me, but save yourselves.
那最好了012---Okay.
搬家公司11个小时后会来   瑞秋还没打包012---The movers will be here in 11 hours. Rachel has not packed.
每个人都得帮忙  钱德012---Now, everybody has to help. Chandler--
不行  我和乔伊有事012---No, I have plans with Joey.
你不是说你们没事   这是最后一次了嘛012---I thought you said you were doing nothing. Yes, but for the last time.
好吧  罗斯012---Okay, fine. Now, Ross--
我没办法帮忙   为什么012---Oh, but I can't do it. Why not?
班要来   因为班要来012--- I’ve got Ben. Because, because I’ve got Ben.
都快8点了  他都快上床了  他在哪里012---It's almost 8:00, it's almost past his bedtime. Where is he?
他去参加晚宴了012---He's at a dinner party.
他真的要来吗   到时候我能看得到你家了012---Is he really coming? Because I can see into your apartment.
当然是真的012---Of course he is. Uh,
难道我会拿儿子当借口012---You think I'd just use my son as an excuse?
你把我当成哪种爸爸了012---What kind of father do you think I am?
好吧  对不起012---All right. Sorry.
我得回家做个班的复制品了012---I gotta go make a fake Ben.
来了  室友时代最后的彼萨012---Here it is. Our last pizzas together as roommates.
我不知道你会买披萨  我叫了中国菜012---I wish I'd known you were gonna do that. I ordered Chinese.
没关系012---Oh. Oh, that's okay.
其实这样蛮好的012---Hey, actually, in a way it's kind of nice. You know?
我们最后的两人晚餐  我  带我祖先的食物012---Our last dinner together. Me, bringing the food of my ancestors...
你  带你祖先的食物012---...you, the food of yours.
乔伊  我有个比较奇怪的想法012---Say, Joe, I had a strange idea for what to do on our last night.
我们来打几盘   赌钱如何012---What do you say we play a little, uh, foosball for money?
你疯了  自97年伤后复出  你就没赢过我012---Are you crazy? You haven't beaten me once since my injury-plagued '97 season.
你拿钱送我还比较快012---It'd be easier if you'd just give me your money.
是啊012---Yes, it would.
你觉得50元如何012---Ahem. What do you say to $50?
好  赌了  好  开赛012---Okay, you're on. Okay, let's play.
世纪之战   意大利对012---The big game. Italy versus...
当然是中国队012---...China, apparently.
看  是直排轮鞋012---Oh, look, it's the Rollerblades.
天哪012---Oh, God.
记得我们什么时候买的吗012---You remember when we got these?
不记得012---No.
那你应该不在012---Oh, I guess you weren't there.
喂  我们说过要开心的012---You guys, we said we were gonna have fun.
别这样  记不记得那次012---Come on. Hey, ha, ha, remember the time...?
你们不记得吗012---You don't remember?
对不起  菲比  要搬走了我真的很难过012---Sorry, Pheebs. I guess I'm just really sad that I'm leaving.
我会很想你012---I'm gonna miss you so much.
其实  不必这么难过012---Well, this doesn't have to be so sad though, you know?
别再想你们会想念对方了012---Maybe instead of just thinking about how much you’re gonna miss each other...
想想你们不会怀念的事012---...you should, like, think about some of the things you're not gonna miss.
我觉得没有012---I don't think there's anything.
拜托  总会有两件012---Come on, there's gotta be something.
没有  她太完美了012---Nope. She's perfect.
我有一件012---I have one.
很好  你先说012---Good. Great. Okay, you can go first.
我不会想念012---Uh, well, I guess I'm not gonna miss the fact...
你不准我把留言笔拿走012---...that you're never allowed to move the phone pen. Ha, ha.
说得好  摩妮卡  你有吗012---That's a good one. Okay, Monica, anything?
瑞秋会把留言笔拿走吗012---You know, does Rachel move the phone pen?
有时候会012---Aw, sometimes. Ha, ha.
其实  每次都会012---Always, actually.
这就对了  这样不是好多了012---Good. There you go. Doesn't everyone feel better?
不只是留言笔012---Not just the phone pen. 
我老是收不到留言012---I never get my messages.
你收到啦012---You get your messages.
趁你在沙发上睡着012---Well, I don't think it counts if you have to read them off your hand...
去看你的手背应该不算012---...after you've fallen asleep on the couch.
那你是没接到谁的留言  钱德012---So you missed a message from who? Chandler?
还是你妈012---Or your mom?
还是钱德012---Or Chandler?
还是你妈012---Or your mom?
太好了  成功了  没人难过了012---Great, it worked. No one's sad. Heh.
万岁012---Yes. Ah.
我又赢了  你已经欠我5百了012---I win again. Ha, ha, that's, like, 500 bucks you owe me. Woo-hoe!
5百元了012---Man. Five hundred dollars.
5百元值很多电012---That is a lot of electricity, huh? Woo-hoo!
我得买点吃的012---Ooh, I gotta buy some food.
给我捞本的机会  骤死赛012---Okay, okay. Give me a chance to win my money back. Sudden death...
一球  1千012---...one goal, $1000.
真的  当然012---You serious? Oh, yes.
好012---0Key.
准备欠我钱吧   好012---Get ready to owe me. Okay.
来吧  好了吗012---Okay, here we go. Ready?
不  不  不012---No, no, no! No, no, no!
要想赢我012---one can beat me.
看吧  所以只有小假人可以出脚012---See, now that's why only the little fake men are supposed to do the kicking.
哈罗012---Hello?
罗斯  看吧  还有别人会打来012---Oh, hi, Ross. See, other people call me.
你老哥  了不起012---Ooh, your brother. Score.
怎样  我跟班在一起012---What's up? I'm here with Ben.
想跟你问个好012---Thought we'd say hi.
叫他听  班  跟摩妮卡姑姑打招呼012---Put him on. Ben, say hi to Aunt Monica.
看来他现在不想说话012---Oh, I guess he doesn't feel like talking right now.
不过他在笑012---Uh, he's smiling, though.
好  待会再聊012---Okay, talk to you later.
我觉得你们难过时比较好012---I think it was better when you guys were sad.
记得这双直排轮鞋吗012---Hey, oh, remember the Rollerblades? Oh.
你知道我还不会想念什么  "我是摩妮卡012---You know what else I'm not gonna miss? "I'm Monica.
我一天刷十七次马桶  有人在上也照刷"012---I wash the toilets 17 times a day, even if people are on it."
"我是瑞秋  我的毛衣太紧了吗  不会012---"Hi, I'm Rachel. ls my sweater too tight? No?
那我得洗一洗  让它缩水"012---Oh, I'd better wash it and shrink it."
"我是摩妮卡  都没有有趣的人给我留言"012---"I'm Monica. I don't get phone messages from interesting people. Ever."
我会打给她012---Hey, I call her.
"天哪  我爱罗斯  我恨罗斯   我爱罗斯   我恨罗斯"012---"Oh, my God. I love Ross. I hate Ross. I love Ross. I hate Ross."
天哪  我交不到男朋友012---"Oh, my God. I can't find a boyfriend.
干脆到对面去  看到谁就上谁"012---So I guess I'll just stumble across the hall and sleep with the first guy I find in there."
如果想赶去餐厅  就得快了012---Yeah, we should get a move on if we want to make those dinner reservations.
还是不能玩012---Still broken?
真是烂透了012---It sucks, man.
你在这里的最后一晚   我却失去两样最重要的东西012---Your last night here, and I lose the two most important things in my life,
手足球桌012---The foosball table...
和5百元012---...and $500.
有别的办法可以把钱赢回去  要不要012---Well, you know, there are other ways you can win back your money,how about a little uh.
玩21点  我不喜欢玩21点012---a little Blackjack? Ah, not my game.
那就玩  我们可以玩个新游戏012---Okay, uh, how about--you know what? We could play a new game.
新游戏  很好玩  叫什么名字012---A new game. It's fun. What's it called?
杯牌012---Cups.
我不会玩杯牌  我教你  来嘛  简单又好玩012---I don't know how to play Cups. I’ll teach ya! Come on, come on, really easy and really, really fun..
好吧  好  拿牌012---All right. Okay, here you go.
我有两张皮蛋  你呢012---I have two queens. What do you have?
二和五  你赢了  50元012---A two and a five. Whoa, you win. Fifty dollars.
真的  没错  再玩  好了吗012---Really? Oh, yeah. Okay, let's play again. Ready?
你是什么牌  四和九012---What have you got? A four and a nine.
开玩笑  不会吧012---You're kidding, right?
怎么了  那是满杯012---No. Why? Well, that's a full cup.
我真是杯牌高手012---Damn, I am good at Cups.
我不要跟她说话012---I'm not talking to her.
总得有人先开口啊012---One of you has to take the first step...
这个人应该是你   因为她要搬走012---...and it should be you because she's the one who's leaving.
她比较难过012---It's harder for her.
也许吧012---Maybe you're right.
但她嘲笑我的留言笔012---She made fun of my phone pen.
我知道  我也觉得很过分012---I know. I took it hard too.
瑞秋  刚才的事我很012---Listen, Rachel, I feel bad about what happened--
你在干什么  把东西拿出来012---What are you doing? I'm unpacking.
什么  我不搬了  这幅画正吗012---What? I'm not moving. Is that picture straight?
离左边差了十万八千里012---It needs to go about 2O blocks to the left.
你知道吗012---Hey, you know what?
是你要改变  跟钱德同居012---You're the one who wants this big change and move in with Chandler.
你才应该走  为什么要我走012---You should be the one to go! Why do I have to leave?
因为这是我的房子  它也是我的  还有呢012---Because It's my apartment! Well, it's mine too. What else you got?
还有就是  你要搬出去012---How about: You're moving!
不  不  不  要  要  要012---No, no, no. Yes, yes, yes.
好了  摩妮卡012---Okay, Monica--
这样太可笑了012---This is ridiculous.
我们应该帮你打包012---We should be packing you.
你们谈得怎样  很好  摩妮卡要搬走012---Hey, how you guys doing? Great. Monica's moving.
我才没有012---I am not!
是吗  那为什么你的东西都在这个箱子里012---Oh, really? Well, how come all your stuff is in this box?
好  我知道是怎么回事了012---Okay, you guys, you guys, I think I know what's going on here.
喂  停012---Okay? You guys? Stop!
你们是假装生气   就怕相互舍不得012---I know that, I know that you're acting mad because you think that will make it easier to leave.
其实内心深处  你们还是很难过的012---But deep down, you're still really sad. Deep, deep down.
不  菲比  我很生气   最最最深处012---No, Phoebe, I am mad! Well, deep, deep, deep down.
我就是很生气012---Yeah, I'm just mad.
那就继续追吧012---Then keep running.
你赢了012---You win.
你是什么牌  不重要  什么都比不上012---What did you have? Doesn't matter. Nothing beats...
三和六012---...a three and a six.
那叫D罩杯012---That, my friend, is "D Cup."
你目前为止  赢了多少012---Okay, now, how much have you won so far?
哇  7百  不是正好7百吧012---Wow. Seven hundred. Not 700 exactly?
是啊  再加7百012---Yeah. Heh. Double it.
什么  在杯牌里   一旦赢到7百012---What? Yeah, see, in Cups, once you get $700...
就得自动加码012---...you have to double it.
真的  规则又不是我订的012---Really? Hey, I didn't make up the rules.
拿到加码奖金后  你可以拿一张牌012---Okay, so now, after you receive the doubling bonus, you get, uh, one card.
那张牌有可能值1百元  让你总共赢得1千5012---Now, that one card could be worth $100, which brings your total to 1500.
哇啊  不  不  不012---Ooh. No, no, no.
别太兴奋   除非你拿到  不会吧012---Don't get too excited, because that's not gonna happen unless you get the-No way.
这是最后一箱衣服012---Well, this is the last box of your clothes.
我会在上面注明  "你在想什么"012---I'm just gonna label it "What were you thinking?"
有意思  我正想到对面  在钱德身上那样写012---Funny, I was just gonna go across the hall and write that on Chandler.
两位  不是我想雪上加霜  但是012---Okay, you guys, I don't mean to make things worse, but...
我不想跟瑞秋住了012---...I don't wanna live with Rachel anymore.
什么  你们对对方太刻薄012---What? You're just so mean to each other.
我不想跟瑞秋翻脸   我还是喜欢你012---And I don't wanna end up like that with Rachel. I still like you.
没关系   菲比  因为我不搬了012---Well, Phoebe, that's fine because I'm not moving.
菲比  你一定要收留她012---Whoa, whoa, whoa. Phoebe, you gotta take her.
我说了很多她的坏话012---You know, I know I said some bad stuff...
但瑞秋也有一些好室友的特质012---...but Rachel does have some qualities that make her a good roommate.
是吗  像什么  摩妮卡012---Oh, really? Like what, Monica?
她有几千双靴子012---You know how she has 147,000 pair of boots?
真是个好的开始012---Oh, yeah, good start, Mon.
她会借给你穿012---She lets you borrow them. Yeah.
然后你再用你的大脚把它撑大012---And you stretch them out with your big old clown feet.
你想睡路边吗  天气要变冷了012---Do you wanna live outside? Because it's getting cold.
她有一大堆目录012---She gets tons of catalogs...
她会把我会喜欢的部分折起来012---...and, um, she'll fold down the pages of the things she thinks I'd like.
还有呢012---What else? Uh...
我洗澡时012---When I take a shower...
她会在镜子上留言给我012---...she leaves me little notes on the mirror.
那倒是012---Yeah, I do. I do do that.
真好  我喜欢浴室里有东西可读012---That's nice. I like having things to read in the bathroom.
我在沙发上看书看到睡着012---When I fall asleep on the couch after reading...
她会帮我盖毯子012---...she covers me over with a blanket.
我不希望你冷到012---Well, you know, I don't want you to be cold.
我说我要跟钱德同居时012---And when I told her I was gonna be moving in with Chandler...
她非常支持我012---...she was really supportive.
你真好012---You were so great.
让我无后顾之忧012---You made it so easy.
现在你要走了012---And now you have to leave.
我得跟一个男生住了012---And I have to live with a boy!
不会有事的012---It's gonna be fine.
瑞秋  我真希望你赶快搬进来012---Okay, Rachel. Now I can't wait to live with you.
而且我们应该012---You know what we should do?
把摩妮卡也一起带来012---Bring Monica, and then we can all live there together.
一定会很好玩012---We'll have so much fun!
但是她要跟钱德住012---But, honey, I think she's moving in with Chandler.
也对012---Oh, that's right.
你还是要跟他住吗012---You're still set on that?
应该吧012---Kind of.
我的天哪012---Oh, my God.
哈罗  嘿  摩妮卡012---Hello? Hey, Mon.
打包顺利吗012---How's the packing going?
班  他很好  他就在  妈呀012---Ben? He's fine. Yeah, he's right-Oh, my God.
把头从衣服里伸出来  儿子012---Get your head out of your shirt there, son.
什么012---What?
对  是南瓜  我过去帮忙012---Yeah, it's a pumpkin. I'll come pack.
嘿012---Hey.
怎么了  罗斯和我帮忙打包012---What's wrong? Ross and I were helping the girls pack...
休息时  我跟他玩杯牌输了1千5012---...took a little break. I lost $1500 to him in Cups.
玩杯牌  怎么会输那么多012---Wha--? How did you lose at Cups?
跟你输的方式一样012---The same way you lost.
我先拿到老K和皮蛋  砰  罗斯拿到2和3012---I started outwith the king and the queen. Barn. Ross gets a two and a three.
然后我拿到杰克和老K  砰  罗斯拿到4和5012---Then I get a jack and a king. Boom. Ross gets a four and five.
罗斯拿到满杯   D罩杯012---Even Ross was getting the Cup card, the D Cup...
和自动加码   我连半副杯牌都凑不到012---...the sitting-down bonus. Meanwhile, I didn't even get a half cup. Nothing.
天哪012---Oh, man.
他之前也没玩过012---He never played before either.
我觉得玩杯牌都靠新手的牌运012---You know what I think? I think beginner's luck, very important in Cups.
好  我们再玩一把012---Let's just play one more hand. One more hand.
不要  我1毛钱也输不起了  我是说真的012---No, no more. I cannot lose another dime. I'm serious this time.
事实上  我要送你一样东西012---In fact, look. There's-I wanna give you something, okay?
现在先送  免得我因为赌债拿去当给你012---And let me give it to you now before I pawn it for Cups money.
我要把大白狗送给你012---Now, I want you to have the big, white dog...
谢谢你这些年来的照顾012---...as a-Kind of a thank-you for being such a great roommate.
我不能收  你很喜欢这个雕像012---I can't take the big, white dog. You love it.
他不是雕像   他是活的012---It's "him." Not "it."
要是我跟你买呢012---Well, what if I bought it from you, you know?
你可以以合理的价格卖给我012---And then your nice gesture would be giving it to me at a reasonable price.
1千5如何012---Say $1500?
等一下  我知道你想干嘛了012---Wait a second. I see what you're trying to do here.
你又想塞钱给我012---You're trying to give me money again.
我什么时候塞钱给你了012---When did I try to give you money?
之前看帐单的时候012---Before, over there with the bills.
你想施舍我  我说不要  你也就算了012---You tried to give me charity, I said no, you dropped it.
然后  我们开心地度过最后一晚012---Okay, then we had a nice last night together.
说笑  赌钱  谁也没塞钱给谁012---We had some fun, we gambled, nobody tried to give anybody any money.
现在你  突然又想来这套012---Now, out of the blue, you start with the charity thing again.
我只是想帮助你   我想确定你的生活没有问题012---I'm just trying to help you out, okay? I wanna make sure that you're okay.
我会没问题的  听着  钱德012---I will be okay. Look, Chandler.
你不能老觉得我无法照顾自己012---You gotta get it out of your head that I can't take care of myself, okay?
我不会怀念你借钱给我012---Look, I'm not gonna miss you helping me outwith money.
我唯一会怀念的012---The only thing I'm gonna miss...
就是你012---...is you.
现在还有这只狗012---And now the dog.
嘿012---Hey.
到了后打电话给我  好吗  好的012---Call me when you get there, okay? Okay.
我真的会很想你012---I'm really gonna miss you.
钥匙要还你012---Oh, I have your key.
拿去   谢谢012---Here you go. Thanks.
天哪   多好笑  再过几小时就会见面了012---Oh, God, this is silly. I'm gonna see you in a couple of hours.
再见  房子012---Bye,house.
再见012---'Bye-bye. Bye.
嘿012---Hey.
她真的走了  我知道012---She really left. I know.
谢谢你  不客气  室友012---Thank you. No problem, roomie.
我可以问你个问题吗  当然可以012---Can I ask you a question? Sure.
那只狗怎么会在这里012---What the hell is that dog doing here?
我捏造了杯牌   这样好塞钱给乔伊012---I invented the game of Cups as a way to give Joey money.
现在你想把钱要回去  没错012---And now you want that money back? Exactly.
钱德  你以为我是白痴吗012---Chandler, what kind of idiot do you take me for?
没有那种牌  那是我捏造的012---It's not a real game. I made it up.
很遗憾  你输了钱  但我赢得光明正大012---I'm sorry you lost your money. But I won it fair and square.
游戏是假的012---At a fake game!
如果你想赢一点回去012---Now, if you wanna try to make some of it back...
我愿意陪着你玩  但我必须警告你012---...I'd be glad to play you for it. But I should warn you.
我是杯牌高手012---I am very good at Cups.
好  你上次玩  有出现杯盘牌吧012---Okay, now, I assume the saucer card came up when you played last?
没有012---No. Hmm.
看看这次会不会出现012---Let's see if it comes up this time.
好了吗   好了012---Ready? Yeah.Okay.

在哔声后012---Leave.
在哔声后  那个我说过了012---But I just said "leave."
我知道  因为你都分到好的字012---Yeah, I know, because you have all the good words.
而我呢  "这是"  "和"  还有"留言"  我不要012---What do I get? I get "it’s," "and" oh I'm sorry, I have "A." Forget it.

你不是普通角色   对吧012---Oh, you're no ordinary roommate, are you?
菲比  待会再录好吗  我想在天黑前去慢跑012---Phoebe, come on, can we finish this later? I wanna go running before it gets dark.
你也一起来跑嘛  真的012---Why don't you come with me? Really?
对   一定很好玩的012---Yeah, oh, it'll be fun.
去公园跑步  当做室友间第一次联络感情012---We'll run in the park. It'll be like our first, you know, roommate-bonding thing.
好  我们去跑步012---Okay, let's go running!
而且  那里还有帅哥  那我们就朝那边跑012---Yeah, and there's cute guys there. Let's run towards them!
好012---0Kay.

老友记  第六季  第7集  菲比跑步012---Friends  S06E07  The One Where Phoebe Runs
我刚看完一本很棒的书012---So I just finished this fascinating book. Hmm.
到了2030年  有些电脑012---By the year 2030, there'll be computers...
能执行跟人脑一样多的命令012---...that can carry out the same amount of functions as an actual human brain.
所以  理论上  你可以把思想记忆012---So, theoretically, you could download...
下载到这种电脑上012---...your thoughts and memories into this computer...
然后以机器的形态长生不老012---...and live forever as a machine.
我刚发现我能睁着眼睛睡觉012---And I just realized I can sleep with my eyes open.
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
把箱子钉在地上真是聪明012---Honey, it was a great idea, nailing the boxes to the floor.
我没把箱子钉在地上   所以你可以搬走了012---I didn't nail the boxes to the floor. Oh, so you can move them.
可以  我这就搬   罗斯有个很好听的电脑故事012---Yes, and while I'm doing that, Ross has a great computer story for you.
嘿  大家好   这是吉宁012---Hey, everybody. Uh, I'd like you to meet Janine.
她是我的新室友012---She's gonna be my new roommate.
你好012---Hi. Hi.
她要来跟我住012---And she's gonna live with me!
很高兴认识你  吉宁012---It's nice to meet you. Janine...?
勒夸  吉宁勒夸012---Lecroix. Janine Lecroix.
我都不知道  好好听的姓啊012---I didn't know that. What a pretty last name.
你是哪里人012---So, uh, where are you from?
澳洲人  两星期前刚到012---Australia. I just moved here a couple of weeks ago.
来自于南半球  对012---From the land down under? Yeah.
这个我也不知道012---I didn't know that either.
你做哪一行012---So, what do you do?
我是个舞者  你是个舞者012---I'm a dancer. You're a dancer?
她是个舞者012---She's a dancer.
我要去整理东西了  我帮你开门012---Well, I think I'll go and unpack. Here, let me--
乔伊   在012---Joey? Yeah?
你叫她搬来之前有先面试过吗012---Did you even interview this woman before you asked her to move in?
有  当然有啊012---Of course I did. Uh-huh.
你到底问了些什么012---What exactly did you ask her?
你什么时候可以搬来012---When can you move in?
谢谢你把她带到我们身边012---Thank you for bringing her into our lives.
好个大美人012---Unbelievable.
你也喜欢她  钱德012---Oh. Oh, so you like her too, Chandler?
你看这堆箱子012---Hey, look at all the boxes.
我好想赶快约她012---I cannot wait to ask her out.
等等  乔伊  乔伊  你不能约她012---Wait a minute, Joey. Joey, you can't ask her out.
她是你的室友  那样的话太复杂了012---She's your roommate. It'll be way too complicated.
没错  千万不要012---Yeah, man, don't do it.
你约了她   我就不能约她了012---I mean, if you date her, then I can't date her.
你之前跟一个叫唐娜的交往  后来分手了012---Think about it. Remember when you were going out with Donna and you broke up...
记得你们在超市巧遇的尴尬吗012---...remember how horrible it was when you bumped into her at the supermarket?
没错012---Oh, God, yeah.
想像你住在超市里012---Now imagine you live at the supermarket.
好啊012---0Kay.
不   不   不是012---No, no. Oh. Oh.
你说得对   那样很不好   我不能约她012---You're right. I don't want that. I can't date her.
最好也别跟她调情  住得这么近012---And you'd better watch the flirting too, because in close quarters...
太可怕了  可能会出事012---...it could be trouble. Well, that's gonna be tough, Mon.
太难了  毕竟美女当前   我很难不打情骂俏012---I mean, it's hard for me to be around an attractive woman and not flirt.
我老是在你面前  你也没怎样么012---Heh. Well, you're around me all the time, and you don't flirt.
有点难过  是吧012---A little sad about that, sweetie?
我要绑鞋带  你先跑  我就来012---I have to tie my shoes, so you go ahead. I'll catch up.
好  好012---Okay. Okay.
拜托   那哪叫跑步啊   快点012---Come on, that's not running. Let's go!
我是说真的  她跑步的时候012---You guys, I'm telling you, when she runs...
就像大嘴蛙012---...she looks like a cross between Kermit the Frog...
和生化机器人合体012---...and the Six Million Dollar Man.
摩妮卡以前好喜欢他012---Monica had such a crush on him. Ha, ha.
她睡觉之前都会亲他的海报012---She used to kiss his poster every night before she went to bed.
我也会012---I used to do that too.
你有他的专辑 《全身绿色的烦恼》吗012---Oh,my God. Did you also have his album, It's Not Easy Being Green?
摩妮卡012---Oh, Mon.
所以菲比的姿势很怪012---So Phoebe runs weird, huh?
对  而且她还想再去跑012---Yeah. And you know what? And I know she's gonna want to run again.
我跟她住在一起  躲不掉012---I don't know how to get out of it. I mean, I live with her.
你就实话实说嘛012---Why don't you just be straight with her? Tell her the truth.
你说得对  我应该跟她直说012---You're right. You're right. I should just tell her the truth.
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
菲比  摩妮卡把我绊倒了   我再也不能跑步了012---Hey, Pheebs, Monica tripped me. I don't think I can ever run again, ever.
为什么  你为什么要绊倒她012---Why? Why would you do that?
我不知道012---I don't know.
瑞秋  抱歉害你两个脚踝受伤012---Rachel, I'm sorry that I hurt your ankles.
只有一个  等着瞧012---Ankle. We'll see.
好  东西都拿出来了012---Okay. I am officially unpacked.
多谢帮忙012---Thanks for helping me, man.
乔伊012---JOe?
看来他回家了012---Well, I guess Joey went home.
看  还有一个箱子没拆012---Oh, and look, there is still one box that I have to unpack.
你被骗了012---I got you.
天哪  我差点被吓出心脏病012---Oh, my God, you almost gave me a heart attack.
我想笑想得好辛苦012---It was so hard not to laugh, I'll tell you.
很像一回事嘛012---Hey, the place looks great.
不赖吧012---Yeah, not bad, right?
摩妮卡今天要加班   我要把这里打扫得一尘不染012---You know what? Monica's working late, so I'm gonna make this place spotless.
还有  还有012---You know what else I'm gonna do?
我还要下楼去  买花送她012---I'm gonna go downstairs, I'm gonna get her some flowers.
谁不想跟我住012---Now, who would not want to live with me?
我不想012---I don't.
我想跟性感的澳洲舞者住012---No, I want to live with the super-hot Australian dancer.
情况如何  你能不打情骂俏吗012---How's that going, though? Are you okay with the not-flirting thing?
目前  还可以  但是好累啊012---Yeah, so far. Yeah. But it's tough, you know?
我的调情能量一直在累积  无处发泄012---I've got all this built-up flirting energy, and I don't know how to get rid of it.
你好吗012---How you doing?
天哪012---Oh, man.
抱歉   客厅比较宽012---Sorry. There's just more room out here.
不   不是  我只是想到  我也该拉拉筋了012---Oh, no, no, you just, uh, reminded me that I have to do my stretches too.
你应该012---Why don't you try to be...? Aah!
怎么了  没事012---What's wrong? Uh, nothing.
你不要碰我012---I just-I didn't want you to touch me...
我拉筋拉得全身都是汗012---...because I'm all sweaty from the workout. Ha, ha.
我去洗个澡012---I'm gonna hit the shower.
我的天哪012---Oh, my God.
抱歉在浴室晾衣服012---Oh, sorry about that stuff hanging in there.
我的丁字裤很娇贵  不能烘干012---It's just my thongs are too delicate for the dryer.
啊嗯012---Aah! Hi.
没错  是我012---Oh, yeah, uh-huh, it's me.
我看到你抄着慢跑鞋就溜出来了012---I saw you grab your running shoes this morning and sneak out.
你骗我   好自己跑步012---You lied so you could run by yourself.
不是  菲比  我没有  我是012---No, Phoebe, no. I was-No.
我只是跑跑看看012---I was actually just checking...
看看我012---...to see...
能不能跑   结果还可以012---...if I could run. And I can.
拜托  瑞秋  我又不是白痴012---Please, Rachel, I'm not an idiot.
不  等等  菲比012---No, wait. Phoebe?
同居真的会让人越来越像012---Wow. Couples who live together do start to look alike.
摩德012---So, Mondler...
嗯012---Uh...
你在干什么012---What, uh--? What are you doing?
你说呢  我在打扫012---What does it look like? I am cleaning.
你动她的东西有经过她同意吗012---Did you get Monica's authorization to move all of her stuff?
同意  没必要吧  我会把东西都放回去012---Authorizat. I don't need that. I'm gonna put everything back.
完全恢复原状吗012---Put it back exactly where you found it?
当然是  完全恢复原状012---Yes. I'm gonna put it back exactly where I found it.
这种态度对你没有帮助012---Okay, first of all, that attitude is not helping.
她才不会在乎有没有恢复原状012---She won't care if I put her stuff back in the same stupid place.
你是刚认识摩妮卡吗012---Hello? Did you just meet Monica?
她会认同我的体贴的012---She's gonna recognize that I did a nice thing...
而且会感到贴心012---...and appreciate it.
其实  这样也蛮好的012---Huh. No, actually, this will work out well.
等你必须搬回去跟乔伊住012---Because when you have to move back with Joey...
乔伊热辣的新室友就可以跟我来住012---...Joey's hot new roommate can come live with me.
我懂了  你想吓我012---Oh, I see, I see. You're trying to freak me out.
钱德  摩妮卡对这种事有怪癖012---Look, Chandler, Monica is really weird about this kind of stuff, all right?
相信我  我跟她住了16年  她会捉狂的012---Believe me, I lived with her for 16 years. She's going to freak out.
天哪  她会压在你身上012---Oh, my God. She's going to sit on you.
她才不会  好吧   我证明给你看012---No, she is not, okay? I'll prove it to you.
我现在就打给她012---I'm gonna call her right now.
电话擦好了012---Phone's done.
摩妮卡  你好吗012---Hi. Hey, Mon. How's it going?
烂透了  什么事都得我自己来012---Terrible. If I want something done right, I have to do it myself.
其他人只会搞砸012---Other people just wreck stuff.
我今晚可能会杀人012---I really think I might kill someone tonight.
别这样  没那么糟吧012---Oh, come on, come on, it can't be that bad.
是非常的糟  想到快见到你了012---It's worse. The only thing getting me through...
我才撑得下去012---...is knowing I'm gonna see you soon.
我搞不好会设法早退  不  不要012---I might get out of here early. No. No, no, no.
不  不  餐厅似乎很需要你012---No, no, it sounds like they need you there.
你跟罗斯在一起吗  一切都很好  再见012---You're just hanging outwith Ross? It's all good. Okay, bye, Mon.
她会宰了我012---She's gonna kill me.
电话放反了012---The phone was facing the other way.
相框应该摆在上面012---And that goes back up there.
知道怎么搞嘛  我们从大型家俱复原开始012---Know what we should do? We should start with the big stuff.
会比较简单  先搬沙发012---That'll be the easiest. So, uh, let's start with the couch.
我没问题012---I got it.
位置好像不对012---Yeah, that doesn't look right.
什么意思  沙发刚好跟毯子对齐012---What are you talking about? The couch is perfectly in line with the carpet.
我可以走到这边  轻松的把脚翘在012---Then I can just walk over here and casually just put my feet right up on...
好  就这样012---Okay, here's what we do.
那就把沙发往茶几那边推012---We just move the couch closer to the coffee table.
那沙发的背后  就不会跟毯子边缘对齐了012---But then the back of the couch won't line up with the back of the carpet.
那就把茶几往012---Okay, well, here, we'll just, uh, move the coffee table...
沙发那边推012---...closer to the couch.
不  那茶几就不在座位区正中央了012---No, whoa, whoa! But then the coffee table won't be centered in the seating area.
那茶几就配不上桌子了  罗斯012---But the coffee table doesn't match the table-Ross.
我该怎么办012---Hi. Look, what am I gonna do?
我不调情  但还像火吸引着飞蛾一样吸引着她  012---I'm not flirting, but still I'm drawing her to me like a moth to a flame.
这里是怎么了012---What the hell's going on over here?
摩妮卡会宰了你012---Monica's gonna kill you.
我需要你们的帮忙012---Look, I need your help, okay?
我得想办法把这个女人吓跑012---I have to do something to repel this woman.
等等   等等012---Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
你们最会把女人吓跑了012---You guys repel women all the time.
我可是结过三次婚012---Hey, I've been married three times.
不  不  我亲眼见识过012---No, no, no, I've seen it happen.
你们跟女人开始都交往得好好的   最后还是都搞砸012---You get a rapport going with a woman, but somehow you manage to kill it.
你们的秘诀是什么012---What's your secret?
我们不会把女人吓跑012---Look, we do not repel women,
完全没有这么回事012---Okay? That is completely untrue.
不过  我们确实会012---Oh, yes, we do, my man.
记不记得  大学参加春季舞会012---Remember back in college when we went to that dance...
你瞄上了那个女生  走过去却不停地大谈012---...and you walked right up to that girl you liked and couldn't stop talking...
爱尔兰的马铃薯饥荒012---...about the Irish potato famine?
那你呢  当年也没那么酷012---Yeah, well, what about you? You weren't so hot in college either.
他每次说完话  都会加叭噜锵砰012---After everything he said, he'd go:
摩妮卡也不喜欢  也许我应该改掉012---Yeah, Monica doesn't like that either. Maybe I should stop doing that.
对了  女生都不喜欢我聊科学012---You know what? Girls don't like it when I start talking about science.
不止是女生012---That's not specific to girls.
太好了  还有呢012---This is great. This is great. What else?
她们不喜欢你纠正她们的文法012---They don't like you correcting their grammar.
她们不喜欢你解释你的笑话哪里好笑012---And they don't like it when you explain why your jokes are funny.
她们不喜欢你一直问她们   喜不喜欢你012---You know, they don't like it when you keep asking them if they like you.
天哪  幸好我有摩妮卡  我再也别想谈恋爱了012---Man, I am so lucky I have Monica. I'm never gonna find love again.
嘿012---Hey
菲比  可以跟你谈谈吗  好啊012---Phoebe, can I talk to you for a second? Sure.
好  我012---Okay. Um, I--
菲比  我只是想跟你道歉012---Phoebe, look, I just wanted to say that I'm sorry, okay?
我不擅长处理这类事情012---I handled the situation horribly.
而且我不该骗你012---And I should not have lied to you.
那你应该怎样012---So what should you have done?
我应该跟你说实话012---Well, I should have told you the truth.
就是012---Uh-huh. Which is?
我之所以不想跟你跑步012---Well, you know, the reason that I didn't want to go running with you is...
是因为012---...because, urn...
你跑步的姿势有点012---...well, you know, the way that you run is just a little...
所以呢   很尴尬012---So? Well, it's embarrassing.
别人都当我们是疯子012---People were looking at us like we were crazy.
你干嘛在意呢   因为他们是人012---Why do you care? Because they're people.
你既不认识  也不会再见到的人012---But people that you don't know and will never see again.
但他们依旧是人012---Yes, but still they are people...
有眼睛012---...with eyes.
我就不怕012---Well, I didn't get embarrassed running next to Miss:
跟喘气小姐跑步012---Choo, choo, choo, choo.
但是  好吧012---But, oh, okay.
难怪你会觉得跟我跑步很尴尬012---No, no, I can see why running with me would be embarrassing to you.
是啊  你完全放不开012---Yeah, okay. You're uptight.
什么  我哪有放不开啊012---What? I am not uptight. Whoa.
我才不会放不开  老兄012---Listen, I am not uptight, man.
没关系  瑞秋  我不是在批评你  你就是这样的012---That's okay, Rachel. I'm not judging you. That's just who you are.
对  我就比较自由  从小就是这样跑012---Me, I'm more free, you know? I run like I did when I was a kid...
因为这样才好玩012---...because that's the only way it's fun, you know?
你从来没有往前冲到腿好像快要断了吗012---I mean, didn't you ever run so fast you thought your legs would fall off...
例如要跑去玩荡秋千012---...you know, like, when you were running towards the swings...
或是玩在躲魔鬼时012---...or running away from Satan?
邻居的狗012---The neighbor's dog.
这盏灯没摆错吧012---Okay, is this lamp in the right place?
管他的  我会把女人吓跑012---Who cares? I repel women.
不  不行  你不能进来012---No, no, no! You can't come in here.
罗斯光着身子的012---Ross is naked!
什么  什么012---What? What?
我不能说我光着身子   她可以看我光着身子012---I couldn't say that I was naked, because she's allowed to see me naked.
为什么一定要有人光着身子012---Why does anyone have to be naked?
罗斯为什么光着身子012---Why is Ross naked?
我要给钱德看一个东西012---I had to show Chandler something.
光着身体看012---Naked?
对012---Yeah, I uh...
我好像有012---I guess I have, a, uh...
男人病012---A guy problem.
跟钱德的一样吗012---Is it the same thing that Chandler had?
待会儿再回来012---Look, just come back later.
我们搞定了  你再回来012---We'll get everything squared away, and you can come back later.
好吧012---Okay. Hey, listen.
浴室洗手台底下  还有钱德的药012---There's still some of Chandler's medicine left under the sink in the bathroom.
再见  再见012---Bye. Bye.
谢天谢地012---Thank God.
你有什么病012---Dude, what'd you have?
没时间了  我们必须专心012---Look, we have no time, okay? We must focus.
要把一切都恢复原状012---We've got to get everything back into its original place.
相册012---The photo album.
相册里一定有一大堆这里的照片012---There were millions of pictures of the apartment in the photo album.
我们可以拿来对比012---We just go through it and match everything to the pictures.
太好了  好主意012---That's perfect. That's brilliant. Yeah.
说真的  你有什么病012---So really, what did you have?
乔伊  我帮你买了啤酒012---Hey, Joey. I've got some beer for you.
是 "帮谁"吧012---Uh, don't you mean "for whom"?
好012---Sure.
我正想叫彼萨  你要一起吃吗012---Listen, I was gonna order some pizza. You wanna share one?
披萨  我又不是没吃过  叭噜砰锵012---Pizza? It's not like I never had that before.
有什么问题吗012---Is there something wrong?
好吧  好吧012---All right, all right.
我就明说了012---Let's just get this out in the open, okay?
你很火辣012---You're hot.
我很俊俏012---I'm lovable.
显然  我们两个很有感觉012---Clearly, there's a vibe going on between us.
但我们是室友012---But we're roommates...
我们不能走上这条路012---...and it's a huge mistake for us to continue down this road.
乔伊  不  我是说真的012---Joey-No, no, no. I'm telling you.
想像你住在超市里  这样你就懂了012---Imagine yourself living in a supermarket and you'll understand.
好吧  所以  我们该怎么办012---Okay? So the question is, what do we do?
不怎么办012---Well, I don't think there is anything to do.
我觉得你人很好012---I mean, I think you're really sweet.
但是我对你没兴趣012---But I'm just not interested in you like that.
嗯012---Oh.
不是012---No, I mean...
你人真的很好  我很高兴能当你的室友和朋友012---You're a really nice guy, and I'm happy to be your roommate and your friend.
只是  我对你012---I'm just, you know, I just...
没有那种感觉012---...don't feel that way about you.
嗯012---Oh.
我知道了012---I see what happened. Ha, ha.
因为我一直想把你吓跑012---It's because I was trying to repel you.
真的  相信我   一旦我放电  情况就大不同了012---Right? Believe me, you'd feel a lot different if I turned it on.
应该不会   绝对会012---I don't think so. Oh, I do.
你好吗012---How you doing?
我很好012---I'm okay.
什么012---What?
怎么了012---What?
我的天哪012---Oh, dear God.
嘿   嘿012---Hey! Hi!
对不起  你说得对  感觉好爽012---I'm so sorry. You're right. This feels great.
对吧  你不要在意别人的目光012---See? And you don't care if people are staring.
才几秒钟  你就跑不见了012---It's just for a second, because then you're gone.
没错  感觉真的好棒  菲比  我觉得好自由好优雅012---It's amazing, Pheebs. I feel so free and so graceful.
嗯012---Oh!
嘿   小心那匹马012---Ha! Hey, look out for the horse.
抱歉012---Sorry.
我可以进去了吗012---Is it okay for me to come in now?
嗯012---Uh-huh.
为什么东西都变了  再见012---Why is everything different? Bye.
没有变啊012---I don't see anything different...
只不过你一进来  房里变得更亮了012---...other than the fact that the room got so much brighter when you came into it.
小茶几位置不对  沙发怪怪的012---Well, the end table is wrong, the couch looks bizarre...
更别提冰箱上的磁铁了012---...and don't even get me started on the refrigerator magnets.
你别生气012---Okay, look, don't be mad, okay?
我整理完东西  想做点让你高兴的事012---But after I unpacked the boxes, I wanted to do something nice for you...
所以我就大扫除了012---...so I cleaned the apartment.
我把东西乱搬  却忘了012---So I moved everything around, and then I forgot...
该怎么复原  对不起  对不起012---...where it went back. And I'm sorry, I'm very sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
没关系012---That's okay.
钱德   你在怕我吗012---Chandler, are you afraid of me or something?
你要我怕你吗012---Do you want me to be afraid of you?
当然不要012---Of course not.
拜托   钱德  你做了这么棒的事012---My gosh, Chandler, what you did is a wonderful thing...
我真的很开心012---...and I really appreciate it.
我知道我对东西的摆设有怪癖012---I know I have this thing where I want everything in the perfect place.
但我万万没想到  你会担心012---But I'd never expect you to worry about that.
真的012---Really?
当然是真的012---Of course.
你最好了012---Oh, you're the best.
过来我抱抱012---You come here to me.
等等  先做该做的事012---Hold on, okay? First things first.
那个012---Okay. Now...
罗斯光着身子时坐过哪里012---Did Ross sit anywhere while he was naked?
书上说到了2030年012---So it said that by the year 2030...
有些电脑能执行跟人脑012---...there will be computers carrying out the same number of functions...
一样多的指令012---...as an actual human brain.
所以理论上   人可以把思想记忆012---So theoretically, you could download your thoughts...
下载到这种电脑上012---...and your memories into this computer--
然后以机器的形态长生不老012---And live forever as a machine.
吉宁  你知道我们现在在做什么吗012---Uh, so, Janine, do you know what we're doing right now?
我们在连结012---You and I, we're interfacing.
我该走了012---Yeah. I gotta go.
你好  我叫钱德  刚搬到对面012---Hi, my name's Chandler. I just moved in next door.
想不想跟我在末日世界012---Would you like to battle me in a post-apocalyptic world...
争夺银河系仅存的能源012---...for control of the galaxy's last remaining energy source?
好啊  邻居  请进012---Sure, neighbor. Come on in.
吉宁在吗012---So, is Janine around?
她去上舞蹈课了012---Uh, no, she’s at dance class.
我可以看看她的房间吗012---Can I check my room?
可以  但是别翻她的东西  她会发疯012---Yeah, but, hey look, don't go through her stuff. She gets really mad.
天哪012---Oh, my God.
一点男人住过的痕迹都没有012---What is th...it's like a guy never lived in here.
小心  这个女性风格很危险  它已经扩散了012---Look, you’ve got to be careful. This girl thing is dangerous. It's spreading already..
是吗012---It is?
这个粉红小抱枕是你的吗012---Yeah, Is this your pretty pink pillow on the couch?
不是012---No.
那个什么都不能装的小盒子呢012---Is that your tiny little box that's too small to put anything in?
也不是012---No. No.
没错  情况很不妙  你是个男人  好嘛012---Okay, this is not good. You are a guy, okay?
这是个"男人"的家012---This is a "guy's" place.
你一旦失去自我  就会开始修指甲012---If you let this go, you’re going to be sitting around with your fingers soaking in stuff..
你说得对  我会找她谈  找她谈谈  做个男子汉012---All right, you're right. I'll talk to her. Talk to her. Be a man.
我是男子汉  保护好你自己012---I'm a man. Defend yourself.
钱德  快点  要缝新的除尘布012---Chandler come on. We have to hem the new dust ruffle.
我马上过去012---Be right there, sweetums.
情况完全不同012---A totally different situation.
老友记  第六季  第8集  罗斯洗牙012---Friends  S06E08  The One With Ross's Teeth
嘿  你们好012---Hey, guys.
跟希拉蕊早餐吃得怎样   还好啊012---Hey, How was breakfast with Hillary? It was okay.
她还是有点因为失恋而沮丧012---She's still kind of depressed because she broke up with her boyfriend.
就是你的性感二厨  希拉蕊吗012---Well, Is this Hillary, your hot assistant chef, Hillary?
没错  我每次进去都盯着我的那个012---Yeah. The one that always stares at me when I come in?
是你挡着路  而看过你一眼的那个012---No. The one who looked at you once because you got in her way.
我还是看得出来  她对我有点意思012---Still, I could tell. She was into me.
你帮我们安排一下嘛012---Well, Why don't you set us up?
你要帮罗斯找对象012---Ooh, are you setting Ross up with someone?
她有婚纱吗012---Does she have a wedding dress?
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
瑞秋  是这样  我在做传单找新客人012---Rachel, Yeah. I'm making up flyers trying to get new massage clients.
我可以去布鲁明岱尔   用复印机吗012---So can I come to Bloomingdale's and use the copy machine?
可以啊   但他们会觉得奇怪   因为我已经离职了012---Well, sure, but they might think it's weird considering I don't work there anymore.
天哪  怎么回事012---Oh, my God. What happened?
我跳槽到罗夫罗兰了012---I got a job at Ralph Lauren.
太好了  恭喜你012---Well, that's great. Congratulations.
都一年了012---A year ago.
你撑了一年  很好012---You've lasted all year. Good for you.
但是  菲比  你还是可以去我现在的公司复印012---But, Pheebs, you could still use the copy machine where I actually work.
午休时间来  免得我老板看到012---But come by at lunch so my boss doesn't see you.
否则金会发疯  她本来就不太喜欢我012---Kim will freak out. She already doesn't like me.
怪了  我的上司也不喜欢我   我的也是012---I don't think my boss likes me. I don't think mine likes me either.
或许这是共通的现象012---Maybe it's a universal thing.
又或许现在是上班时间   你们却在这里打混012---Or maybe because you're all hanging around here at 11:30 on a Wednesday.
上班去吧012---Yeah, let's head off to work.
谢谢  不客气012---Thank you. Sure.
说了你一定不信012---Now you will not believe this.
我在复印时   罗夫罗兰走了进来012---But, I was in the copy room, making copies, and Ralph Lauren came in.
天哪  你有跟他说话吗012---Oh, my God. Did you talk to him?
一点点  他人蛮好的012---Yeah, a little. He seems really nice.
吻功超棒  什么012---Good kisser. What?
什么012---What?
你亲了他   没错012---You kissed him? Totally.
菲比  真的还是假的012---Phoebe, are you serious?
真的  我在里面  他进来自我介绍012---Yeah, I was just in there, he came in and introduced himself.
然后  我们就亲热了  就这样012---The next thing I know, we're making out.You know.
菲比  你知道他已婚吧012---Phoebe,I mean, you do know he's married?
不知道012---No.
菲比012---Phoebe.
难道每次跟男人亲热都要先问012---What am I supposed to do, ask every guy I make outwith if he's married?
不  我是该问012---No, yeah, I should.
嘿  乔伊  嘿012---Hey, Joey. Hey.
可以跟你谈一下吗  你认识照片里012---Uh, can I talk to you for a second? This, uh, kid in this picture. 
这个小孩吗  他是你的亲戚吗012---Do you, uh, know this kid?  Is that like a relative or something?
不是  我只是觉得很可爱012---No. I just thought it was cute.
我就怕这样  好012---Yeah, that's what I was afraid of. Okay, uh...
吉宁  我希望你住得愉快  但是012---Look, Janine, I really want you to feel at home here, but...
你有些东西  太女孩子气了012---...some of this new stuff, it's too girlie.
像什么012---Oh. Like what?
像这个   我们又不认识的可爱宝宝的图片012---Uh, like this. Pictures of cute babies we don't know.
我们不能挂这种东西012---We can't have that.
那是安吉帝斯  她是名艺术家012---Joey, it's Anne Geddes. She's a famous artist.
我不认识这个宝宝  我也不知道她是不是名艺术家012---I don't know this baby. I don't know if she's a famous artist or not.
我不想刁难你  但你做的改变太多了012---I don't want to be a jerk, but you're changing too much around here.
对不起  我只是想让家里舒服一点012---I'm sorry. I just thought I'd try and make the place a little nicer.
但是也太多了012---Yeah, but it's too much stuff.
你摆了蜡烛和那个什么东西012---You know, you got the candles and the "foofy schmoofer" thing here.
这里  还有一幅花洒的画012---Over here, you got a picture of a watering can.
我以为  我相信这个花洒一定很有名012---I just thought-I'm sure it's a famous watering can.
但是拜托啦012---But come on.
浴室那个很烫的棒子是什么012---And what is with the really hot stick in the bathroom?
那是烫发器012---It's a curling iron.
那就没关系012---Oh. Well, that's okay then.
像我的浴巾  我走进浴室012---Okay, my towels, for instance. I come into the bathroom...
我的浴巾却不在地板上012---...and my towel is not on the floor, where I keep it.
而是挂在钩钩上  味道也不一样012---It's up here on some hook. And it smells different.
它变干净了  摸起来也不一样012---It's clean. Yeah, well, it feels different.
它变干了012---It's dry.
好吧  我可以接受干净的浴巾012---All right, I can make my peace with the clean, dry towels.
还有  这些碎片是怎样012---Okay, also, what is with these chips you bought?
不  不  那是干燥花   是用来闻的012---No, no, no. It's potpourri. You're supposed to smell it.
就好像夏天被放在碗里012---Well, that's like summer in a bowl.
金  你好012---Kim, hi.
我一直不知道  你对我的行销报告的看法012---So you know, I…I handed in that marketing report and I never got to hear what you thought.
我没看012---I didn't read it. Ah.
今年的春装一定很棒吧012---So, wow, the spring line's really gonna be great this year, huh?
对012---Yeah.
我听说罗夫罗兰在复印室   跟某人亲热012---So I hear, uh, Ralph Lauren fooled around with someone in the copy room.
从头说起012---Tell me everything.
你们好012---Hey, guysHey.
怎样啊012---What's up?
就是012---You know...
我的天哪012---Oh, my God.
你的牙齿怎么了012---What happened to your teeth?
我漂白了012---I whitened them.
是吗012---Really?
你们觉得呢012---Yeah, what do you think?
我觉得我不该直视它012---I think I shouldn't look directly at them.
少来啊  我是说真的012---Come on, seriously.
确实也白得太夸张了  你的人类012---They're really, really, really white. What was wrong with your old...
的牙齿呢012---...human teeth?
我的确把漂白胶上得太久了012---I did leave the gel on a little longer than it said to.
太久有多久啊   一整天012---How much longer? A day.
你知道  罗斯  今晚要跟希拉蕊约会吧012---Ross you know that tonight is your date with Hillary?
知道  所以我才漂白牙齿  真的  有那么糟吗012---I know. That's why I did it. Come on, are they really that bad?
不  不  不会012---No. No, no, no.
放心好了  希拉蕊是瞎子吧012---You'll be fine. Hillary's blind, right?
过了今晚就是了012---She will be after tonight.
瑞秋  你有没有发现012---Oh, Rach. Uh, do you notice anything--?
你的牙齿  我在外面就看到了012---Your teeth? Yes, I saw them from outside.
说了你们绝对不信012---You guys are never gonna believe this...
菲比跟罗夫罗兰亲热012---...but Phoebe made out with Ralph Lauren.
什么  我的天哪012---What? Oh, my God.
她去我的办公室  然后他们就亲热了012---She ran into him at my office, and they just made out.
最扯的是  我因此赢得老板欢心012---The craziest thing is, now my boss likes me because...
她说这是一整年最棒的八卦012---...I told her about it and she said it was the best gossip she’d heard all year.
今天   我真以我的朋友们为荣012---I am proud of all my friends today.
瑞秋  不敢相信   菲比居然跟罗夫罗兰亲热012---Rachel, I can't believe Phoebe made out with Ralph Lauren.
真是忌妒死了012---Ugh. I'm so jealous.
我是钱德  你活生生的男朋友012---Hi, I'm Chandler, your live-in boyfriend.
钱德  拜托012---Chandler, please. Come on.
你自己看012---Look at him.
我不是女人  不过他还真是秀色可餐啊012---Well, I am no woman, but that is one tasty dish.
嘿012---Hey.
拿去012---Here. Ooh.
那个银发老帅哥是谁012---Who's the silver fox'?
那是你的亲热对象  你不认得吗012---That is your make-out buddy. Don't you recognize him?
等等  "菲比  我爱你  吻我"012---Oh, wait. "Ooh, Phoebe, I love you. Kiss me, please."
那才不是罗夫罗兰   不过声音有点像012---That's not Ralph Lauren. It sounds like him, though.
什么012---What?
不  罗夫跟他一点也不像012---Yeah, no, Ralph doesn't look like that guy.
他很年轻  长发落腮胡  背个大包包012---He's young, and he's got long hair and a beard and a Hacky Sack--
天哪   那不是罗夫罗兰   那是复印小弟肯尼012---Oh, my God. That's not Ralph Lauren. That's Kenny the copy guy.
什么012---What?
完了   我还跑去告诉我老板012---Oh, God-I told my boss that someone made out with Ralph Lauren.
要是她发现我骗她   一定会更讨厌我   菲比012---If she finds out that I lied to her, she is gonna hate me even more. Phoebe!
那个小弟为什么自称罗夫罗兰012---Why would the copy guy say he's Ralph Lauren?
好骗你跟他亲热啊012---To get you to make out with him.
啊哦012---Oh.
也许这件能压住你的白牙012---Okay, maybe this will make them look less white.
不行012---Nope.Heh.
好  没有用的颜色有012---Okay, so colors that don't work are...
蓝  黄  绿  红  黑  白  橘和紫012---...blue, yellow, green, red, black, white, orange and purple.
离约会只剩1小时  我该怎么办012---I don't know what I'm gonna do. That date starts in like an hour.
要是你的肤色白一点  牙齿就不会那么显眼012---Ross, maybe if your skin was lighter, your teeth wouldn't look so bright.
太好了  所以我去换肤就行了  谢谢你012---Oh, great. So all I need to do is get some new skin. Thank you.
我是说你可以化一点妆012---I’m just saying, If we put just a little bit of makeup on you--
哇哦012---Whoa, whoa.
我们已经不是13岁了012---We're not 13 anymore.
罗斯  只剩这个可行的办法012---Ross, this is the only thing left that has a shot at working.
她不会发现我有化妆吗012---Won't she notice I have makeup on?
拜托  半数的男人都有化妆012---Please. Half the guys out there have makeup on.
什么012---What?
半数的人  你就试试看嘛012---Half the people-I mean-Just try it and see.
不要  我死也不化妆012---No, I am not putting on makeup.
罗斯  帮我贴几张传单好吗012---Hello? Ross, could you put up some of these flyers for me?
魔鬼  魔鬼012---No! Demon! Demon!
这样抽屉就会闻起来香香的  旧裤袜也没浪费012---Now our drawers will smell nice, and we didn't waste these pantyhose.
是啊  扔旧内衣会遭天打雷劈012---God forbid we throw out old underwear.
我要去乔伊那边012---You know what? I'm gonna go over to Joey's.
我们还要整理包装纸抽屉012---We're supposed to organize the wrapping paper.
对  但我今天已经够女性化了012---Yes, but I've really gotten in touch with my feminine side enough today.
要是再缝两个香袋   我们就要变成女同志了012---You know. In fact I think we're two sachets away from becoming a lesbian couple.
今天的确很女孩子气  你说得对  抱歉012---This has been kind of a girlie day. You're right. I'm sorry.
不会  我只是想去男人的家012---Nah, Nah, it’s okay. I feel like I need to be in guy place....
做男人做的事012---..You know, do kind of like a man thing.
没错  去乔伊家吧012---Yeah. Go over to Joey's. Go over to Joey's and...
去乔伊家喝啤酒槌墙壁012---...drink some beer and hammer up some dry wall.
男人并非只会喝酒槌墙壁012---You know when guys hang out, they don't just drink beer and hammer up dry wall.
女生也不会只穿内衣打枕头仗012---When girls hang out, we don't have pillow fights in our underwear.
对不起  我们会012---I'm sorry. We do. We do.
我不知道为什么说不会012---I don't know why I said that.
钱德012---Hey, Chandler.
进来  我们在织隔热手套012---Come on in. We're knitting potholders.
不了  乔瑟芬012---No, thanks, Josephine.
罗斯  我想说012---Ross, I was wondering if--
天哪  男人都死哪去了012---Oh, my God. Where are all the men?
金  瑞秋012---Oh. Hi, Kim. Hi, Rachel.
记得我昨天说的事吗  其实没那回事012---Yeah, remember that thing I told you that happened yesterday? Well, it didn't happen.
你没有取消台湾的布料订单012---You didn't cancel the fabric order from Taiwan?
嗯  有两件事不是那么回事012---Okay, two things didn't happen.
我不是说有人在复印室  跟罗夫罗兰亲热012---Remember I told you someone made out with Ralph Lauren in the copy room?
结果是假的012---Well, it turns out that's not true.
是假的  那就好玩了012---It's not true? Oh, that's interesting.
因为我去查过   昨天午休时间012---Because I checked. Only one keycard was used to access the copy machine...
刷卡进复印室的  只有你一个  瑞秋012---...yesterday during lunch, and that keycard belonged to you, Rachel.
不  天哪  你以为我跟他亲热012---Oh, no. No, no, no. Oh, God, you think I made outwith him?
听着  要是你以为跟罗夫上床  就能坐上我的位子012---Listen to me, if you think sleeping with Ralph is gonna get you my job...
你就错了012---..you are sadly mistaken.
我不想坐你的位子   真的012---Oh, no. I don't want your job. I don't.
这真是天大的误会  我没跟他亲热012---Oh, this is such a mistake. I didn't make outwith him.
没人跟他亲热   我昨天没用我的卡012---Nobody made out with him. I did not use my keycard yesterday.
我连刷卡都不会012---I don't even know how to use my keycard.
罗夫  金012---Hi, Ralph. Hi, Kim.
是啊  没跟他亲热012---Yeah. Nothing happened.
刚才的情欲张力一触即发012---You could cut the sexual tension in here with a knife.
之后  我也只能去当厨师012---After that, what could I do except become a chef?
我将来想自己开餐厅012---And someday soon, I hope to open my own restaurant.
嗯012---Mm.
你很善于倾听012---You know, you're a really great listener.
我交往过的男人  多半讲个不停012---Most guys I go outwith, they just talk and talk.
听到后来  真想叫他们闭嘴012---After a while, it's like, "Shut your mouth." You know?
我说太多了  来聊聊你吧012---I've probably been talking too much. Why don't we talk about you?
说嘛  我想知道012---Come on, I want to know.
好  我是长岛人012---Okay. I'm from Long Island.
来纽约念书012---I came to the city for college.
我有个5岁的儿子  平常喜欢012---Um, I, uh, have a 5-year-old son, and in my spare time...
看看谍报小说  再来聊聊你吧012---...I like to read spy novels. But let's talk more about you. Hmm?
如果先把花茎底部  在平底锅上烤一下012---So what's really neat. if you sear the stems of the flowers first in a frying pan...
花就能开得更久  是不是很棒012---...your arrangement will look fresh much longer.
好棒的小秘诀012---Joey, that is such a great tip.
摩妮卡  请你出去一下  我有事找那位插花的女士012---Monica, can you excuse us? I need to talk to the girl with the flowers.
乔伊  你待会过来012---Okay, but, Joey, come over later.
我教你  用松果和花生酱012---I'm gonna teach you how to make a bird feeder...
做喂鸟器012---...out of just a pine cone and some peanut butter.
我最喜欢鸟了012---Aw. I love birds.
你是怎么搞的012---What is the matter with you?
什么  你在插花012---What? You're arranging flowers.
你放枯掉的花012---You got dead flowers.
你装扮成一朵花的宝宝照片012---You've got a picture of a baby dressed like flowers.
这不是乔伊012---This is not Joey.
嘿  我还是乔伊   好吗012---Hey, hey, look, I am still Joey, okay?
花  只不过是很好看012---Flowers, they're just, you know, nice to look at.
那是一个名摄影师照的  宝宝也很有名012---And that happens to be a picture by a famous artist of a famous baby.
你正在变成女人012---You're turning into a woman.
我没有012---No, I'm not.
你怎么这么说   好恶劣啊012---Why would you say that? That's just mean.
我惹你生气了  我说了什么012---Now I've upset you? What did I say?
不是你说了什么   是你的口气012---It's not what you said. It's the way you said it.
天哪012---Oh, my God.
我是女人012---I'm a woman.
现在她觉得我跟他上床  好把她踢下去012---So now she thinks that I made out with him and that I did it to get her job.
你怎么不跟她说实话  我说了012---Why didn't you just tell the truth? I did.
但是她觉得不会有人蠢到  把复印小弟当成罗夫罗兰012---but she doesn’t think anyone would be stupid enough to confuse Kenny the copy guy with Ralph Lauren.
如果肯尼才是公司的首脑呢012---Well, hey, what if Kenny were the real brains behind the whole company?
搞不好罗夫罗兰也只是个门面012---You know. What if Kenny hired that Ralph guy to be the pretty front man, huh?
她想过吗012---Did she ever think of that?
你今天跟肯尼约会了吧012---You were with Kenny today, weren't you?
只有一下下了012---Just for a second. Ugh.
菲比  我该怎么办012---Phoebe, what am I gonna do? Well...
你只好跟罗夫罗兰上床了012---The only thing you can do. Sleep with Ralph Lauren.
我才不跟罗夫罗兰上床   我可以  但是我不会012---I'm not gonna sleep with Ralph Lauren. I mean, I could, but I wouldn't.
跟肯尼上床012---Ooh. Sleep with Kenny.
那样对我也没好处  好处可大了012---That wouldn't help me. Oh, yes, it would.
今晚真的很开心012---I've had a really good time tonight. Mm-hm.
我很少第一次约会   就这么心有灵犀012---You know, I rarely connect with someone this much on the first date.
我也是012---Me neither.
我也很开心012---Uh, I've had a really good time too, you know.
你要吃那块面包吗012---Are you gonna eat that bread?
我只是喜欢闻012---Oh, I just like the smell.
你好搞笑啊012---You make me laugh.
要不要去沙发上坐坐012---Would you like to move over to the couch?
嗯  嗯012---Mm-hm.
我把灯光调暗一点好了012---Maybe I'll just turn down the lights a little?
干脆关灯如何012---How about all the way?
好012---0Kay.
好酷的海报012---Wow, cool poster.
还是要说 "好抢眼的海报"012---Or should I say, "groovy poster"?
那个012---So, uh...
刚才聊到哪里012---...where were we?
那是你的牙齿吗012---Are those your teeth?
对012---Oh.
你看得见是吧012---You can see them, huh?
对  白得很吓人012---Yes. They're insanely white.
我特地为你漂白的012---I did that for you.
你有毛病吗012---What's the matter with you?
我有毛病  你还装黑光灯咧   都1999年了012---What's the matter with me? You've got a black light. It's 1999.
太好了   金012---Oh, good. Kim, hi.
瑞秋  我一直想问你  你看过新的罗夫罗兰床单吗012---Hi, Rachel. Oh. I wanted to ask you, have you seen the new Ralph Lauren sheets?
我在想什么  你当然看过012---What am I thinking? Of course you have.
好012---Okay, look.
很抱歉之前对你说谎012---I'm sorry that I lied to you before.
你猜得没错  罗夫和我交往过  但已经结束了012---You were right. Ralph and I were an item, but we're not anymore.
是吗  对啊012---Oh, really?
他甩了我012---Yeah, he dumped me.
他说  "瑞秋  我不能这样"012---He said, "Rachel, I can't do this.
"虽然你真的很美012---Even though you're a very, very...
很美"012---...very beautiful woman...
"我不能这样  我有家室  对不起"012---...I can't do this. I'm married and I'm sorry."
然后不知为何他又说  "你永远也不会升职012---And I don't know why, but he said, "And you will never get promoted...
尤其不可能高过金   她是罗夫罗兰体系012---...especially not above Kim, who is an integral cog...
不可或缺的重要人物"012---...in the Ralph Lauren machine."
你以为我会相信012---You expect me to believe--
罗夫  金012---Hi, Ralph. Hi, Kim.
天哪012---Oh, my God.
他看你的眼神好冷酷  彷佛对你恨之入骨012---He just gave you the coldest look I've ever seen. It's like he hates you.
所以是真的了012---Then it is true.
当然是真的  我好难过012---Of course it's true. And it hurts so bad.
哦  亲爱的  过来012---Oh, honey, come here.
你会没事的012---Oh, it'll be okay.
大家都一样012---We've all been there.
你和罗夫012---You and Ralph?
复印小弟肯尼012---Kenny the copy boy.
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
我有事要说  怎么了  你心情不好012---Uh, I need to talk to you. What's the matter? You upset?
我很抱歉   我们得把这些女生的东西扔掉012---I'm sorry, but we gotta get rid of all this girlie stuff in here.
我得当个男人012---I, uh-I gotta be a man.
好吗  客厅必须维持男人的风格012---Okay? The living room has to remain a guy place, okay?
就是这样012---That's just the way it has to be.
既然如此  我就拿回我房里012---If that's what you want, I'll just put it all in my room.
好012---Good. Great.
很好   谢谢你的谅解012---And, uh, thanks for being so understanding.
我不想搞得很难看012---I didn't want to make a big deal out of this. you know.
宝宝的照片可以挂在我房里012---But you could, uh, put the picture of the famous baby in my room.
如果你要的话012---I mean, if you want to.
好012---0Kay.
花洒的画也可以012---And, uh, maybe the watering can there.
行012---Sure.
还有这对小盒子012---And a couple of these little tiny boxes.
乔伊   要不要都放到你房里012---Joey, do you want me to put it all in your room?
好吧012---0Kay.
太好了  再见012---Okay, great. Bye.
猜猜谁要来吃感恩节晚餐012---So guess who's coming to Thanksgiving dinner.
薛尼鲍迪012---Sidney Poitier? Ha, ha.
我怀念瑞秋012---I miss Rachel.
不  是我爸妈012---No, my parents.
太好了  我搬进来之后  他们还没来过012---Oh, That’s great, they haven't seen the place since I moved in.
对  要是你能不提同居的事  就太好了012---Yeah, and y'know, if you could not mention that we live together, that'd be great.
我打算四点左右开动012---I was thinking we'd eat around 4.
为什么不能提同居的事012---Why can't I tell them we live together?
因为他们不知道我们在交往  要在厨房吃吗012---Because they don't know we're dating. Do you think we should eat in the kitchen? 
你为什么没有告诉他们012---Why haven't you told them?
我本来要说  真的012---Um, well, I was going to. I really was.
但是后来不知怎的  就没说了012---But, urn, then somewhere, just out of nowhere, I didn't.
你为什么没说   他们会不开心吗012---Why haven't you told them? Wouldn't they be happy?
四点左右厨房开动   到时候见012---So, dinner in the kitchen around 4. I'll see you then.
他们为什么会不开心012---Why wouldn't they be happy?
因为012---Well, um, because...
主要是012---...mainly, um...
他们不喜欢你012---...they don't like you.
对不起  什么   为什么012---I'm sorry. What? Why? Why?
也许是因为你以前很冷漠012---Maybe because you used to be aloof...
很尖酸刻薄   老爱开玩笑012---...or that you're really sarcastic or that you joke around all the time...
或许是因为你脱了衣服喜欢乱丢012---...or that you take off your clothes and throw them on the couch.
这是他们的还是你的看法012---Is this why they don't like me or why you don't like me?
我知道我应该告诉他们  我不该在意他们012---I know I should have told them. I know I shouldn't care what they think.
对不起012---I'm sorry.
其实没关系   等他们来了  我会表现得很迷人012---You know, it'll be okay, because when they come over, I will be charming.
我会让他们爱上我   然后我们再说012---I will make them love me, then we'll tell them.
你真的觉得可行012---You really think that'll work?
我也可以很有魅力  我不就赢得了你的心012---Hey, I can be pretty charming, babe. I won you over, didn't I?
你应该不会把他们灌得那么醉吧012---I don't think you'll ever get my parents that drunk.
老友记  第六季  第9集  感恩的季节012---Friends  S06E09  The One Where Ross Got High
嘿  太好了  罗斯  你爸妈喜欢我  对吧012---Hey. Oh, good, Ross. Your parents like me, right?
他们当然喜欢你012---Yes, of course they like you.
摩妮卡说他们不喜欢我012---Monica told me they don't.
对  他们不喜欢你012---Yeah, they don't like you.
你知道原因吗012---Do you know why?
也许是因为你很尖酸刻薄  或者是因为012---Maybe it's because you're really sarcastic, or maybe it's because you--
不知道就不要乱猜012---If people don't know, they shouldn't just guess.
帅啊  又一个不值得感恩的感恩节012---This is great, Another Thanksgiving with nothing to give thanks for.
也许我可以感恩你闭嘴012---Maybe I could give thanks for you shutting up, huh?
也许我也可以感恩  你把我的电动送到我的新家012---Maybe I give thanks by taking my PlayStation to my new apartment.
也许我爱你012---Maybe I love you.
嗨  嗨012---Hi. Hi.
你们好012---Hey, guys.
不要  我不想打电动  乔伊012---No, I don't want to play video games, Joey.
你们要去钱德家过感恩节吗012---Are you guys going to Chandler's for Thanksgiving?
对  怎么了012---Yeah, why, what's up?
我和几个舞者朋友想一起庆祝012---Well, me and my dancer friends are thinking of doing Thanksgiving uptown.
我想说你们可能想去012---I thought you guys might like to come.
真的去012---For real?
你们是该去钱德家  我们没有人会做菜012---No, but you should go to Chandler's. Because none of us knows how to cook,
最后八成都在喝酒012---We'll probably just drink all day.
我们去  好012---We go to yours. Yeah.
对  我们得过去露个面  毕竟她是我妹妹012---Yeah, see, we have to stop across the hall because it's my sister.
不过有个妹妹是好事啊012---But, you know, actually, uh, growing up with a sister was nice...
让我很了解女人心012---...because it really helped me understand women.
你应该告诉你的朋友们012---Yeah, you should tell your friends that.
好012---0Kay.
真不知道你怎么能骗到三个老婆012---How you got three women to marry you, I'll never know.
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
菲比  你看  感恩节甜点012---Pheebs, check it out. For my dessert...
我决定做酒果酱松糕012---...I have chosen to make a traditional English trifle.
听起来好棒   摩妮卡你的呢012---Wow, that sounds great. And what are you making, Monica?
万一瑞秋的甜点  好吃的被我吃光光012---In case Rachel's dessert is so good that I eat all of it...
别人会没有吃的了012---...and there's none left for anybody else.
我不做012---Nothing.
你不做012---Nothing?
对  我信任你012---No, sweetie. I trust you.
所以要是我搞砸了  就没有甜点了012---So if I mess this up, there's nothing else for dessert?
你不会搞砸的012---You're not gonna mess it up.
摩妮卡  我好高兴  你真的对我有信心  谢谢012---Wow, Monica, I love that. You really have faith in me. Thank you.
技术问题  这些奶油什么时候好012---Technical question: How do you know when the butter is done?
两分钟前  大约变成这样012---Well, it's done about two minutes before it looks like that.
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
菜闻起来好香  这里布置得真漂亮012---Oh. The food smells great, Mon. And the place looks so nice.
感恩节快乐  感恩节快乐012---Hey, happy Thanksgiving, everybody. Happy Thanksgiving.
感恩节快乐012---Happy Thanksgiving.
真是开心  再见012---Well, this has been great. See you.
你们要去哪里012---Where you going? Oh, oh.
我们说过  要去参加乔伊的室友的聚会012---We did say we'd stop by this little thing Joey's roommate is having.
火辣舞者吉宁012---Oh, Janine, the really hot dancer girl?
有些人会说她很有魅力012---Some would say she's attractive, yes.
还有谁会去012---Who else is going to be there?
她的几个朋友   全是舞者朋友012---Uh, some of her friends. Her dancer friends?
对啦  好不好012---Yes. All right?
她的性感舞者朋友都会去的012---All of her hot dancer friends are gonna be there...
她们会喝酒跳舞  我们真的很想去012---...and they'll be drinking and dancing and we really want to go.
都快成功了012---Dude, we were good.
你们哪儿也不准去  你们说要来吃饭就别想跑012---You're not gonna go anywhere, You said you'd eat here and you'll eat here.
扔下我们去看性感舞者012---Yeah, and leaving us to go see hot dancer girls...
就是不太感恩的012---...is not very Thanksgiving-y.
但是012---Oh, but it is.
第一个感恩节就是这样  印地安人和清教徒共进晚餐012---Uh, it's like the first Thanksgiving when the Indians and Pilgrims sat down.
对  然后印地安人告诉清教徒012---Yeah, and then the Indians taught the Pilgrims...
新世界的性感定义是什么012---...what it meant to be hot in the New World.
大家好  嗨012---Hello, everybody. Hi.
爸  妈012---Hi, Dad. Morn.
看  这谁啊  钱德啊012---Look. Look who it is. It's Chandler.
当然了  钱德  你好012---Oh, yes, of course. Hello, Chandler.
伯父  伯母  你们的气色真好012---Mr. and Mrs. Geller, you look wonderful.
欢迎  外套给我们吧012---It is great to have you here. Let us take your coats.
外面在下雪吗012---Whoa, it snowing out there?
没有012---No.
摩妮卡  菜看起来都好棒啊012---Monica, all this food looks wonderful.
你应该考虑走这一行012---You should think about doing this for a living.
就算我有头皮屑  你也不必指着我笑012---Okay, I have dandruff. There's no need to laugh and point.
爸  钱德是在笑你的笑话012---Dad, Chandler was laughing at yourjoke.
我的笑话又不好笑012---My joke wasn't funny.
瑞秋  我刚刚想到012---Rach, I just remembered.
我昨晚梦到盖勒先生012---I had a dream about Mr. Geller last night.
真的吗012---Really?
对  我梦到他把我从火场救出012---Yeah. I dreamt that he saved me from a burning building...
他好英勇好强壮012---...and he was so brave and so strong.
我对他完全改变了看法012---And it's making me look at him totally differently.
他以前只是 "杰克盖勒  摩妮卡和罗斯的爸爸"012---You know, I mean, he used to be just "Jack Geller, Monica and Ross' dad."
现在他是 "杰克盖勒  梦中情人"012---Now he's "Jack Geller, dream hunk."
不知道  对我来说他永远都是杰克盖勒012---I don't know. To me, he'll always be "Jack Geller...
在你换衣服时闯进来012---...walks in while you're changing."
爸  钱德是罗斯最要好的朋友之一012---You know, Dad, Chandler is one of Ross' very best friends.
罗斯是个好青年012---Ross sure is a great guy.
我一直觉得儿子012---You know, I've always felt that how a young man turns out...
是父亲的翻版012---...is a reflection on his father.
我也有同感   请问你爸是做什么的012---I always thought that too. Tell me, what does your father do?
他是同志歌舞秀012---He's a headliner of a...
的头牌012---...gay burlesque show.
瑞秋  你急死人了  快上甜点啦012---Rash, you're killing us. Will you serve the dessert already?
酒醉的舞者都在等我们012---There's drunken dancers a-waiting.
你们看  很漂亮吧012---Look at it. Isn't it beautiful?
是啊  这是什么012---Yeah. What is it?
酒果酱松糕  有很多层012---It's a trifle. It's got all these layers.
先是一层小松糕   然后是果酱012---First there's a layer of ladyfingers, then a layer of jam...
然后是我自己做的乳蛋糕012---...then custard, which I made from scratch...
然后是覆盖盆子  然后又是小松糕012---...then raspberries, more ladyfingers...
然后是豌豆洋葱炒嫩牛肉012---...then beef sauteed with peas and onions...
然后又有一点乳蛋糕012---...then a little bit more custard...
然后是香蕉   最后再涂上鲜奶油012---...then bananas and then I put whipped cream on top.
香蕉前面是什么012---What was the one right before bananas?
炒牛肉吗  我也觉得有点奇怪012---The beef. Yeah, that was weird to me too.
不过我想说  "连甜肉馅饼都有了"012---But then, y'know, I thought, "Well, there's minced meat pie."
那是一种英式甜点012---That's an English dessert.
英国人都放一堆怪东西012---These people just put very strange things in their food.
对了  可以跟你借兰姆酒吗012---By the way, can I borrow rum from your place?
当然可以012---Yeah, sure.
我不在的时候你们可别偷吃012---And while I'm gone, don't you boys sneak a taste.
好  好012---okay. okay
甜点加牛肉012---Beef in a dessert?
不  不  不可能的012---No, no, no. There is no way.
就是啊  而且果酱才一层012---I know. And only one layer of jam?
有没有搞错012---What is up with that?
天哪  这012---Oh, my God.
两页黏在一起了  钱德012---The pages are stuck together. Chandler.
天哪  她做了酒果酱松糕加012---Oh, my God. She made half an English trifle and...
肉馅马铃薯泥饼012---...half a shepherd's pie.
完了  她得重做了012---Man, now she's gonna start all over.
我们没办法带那些辣妹  认识新世界了012---We're never gonna get to introduce the hot girls to the New World.
不  我们可以  不要告诉她就是了012---No, no, we will. We just won't tell her she messed up.
然后让她上那个牛肉乳蛋糕012---Just let her serve the beef-custard thing?
对  这会是一个有趣的感恩节回忆012---Yeah. It'll be like a funny Thanksgiving story.
呕吐的回忆  的确很有趣012---Vomiting stories are funny, I guess.
乔伊  天哪  你家热死了012---Joey. God, your apartment is like a hundred degrees.
你会不会想脱到只剩下内衣012---Did it make you want to walk around in your underwear?
不会012---No.
还不够热012---Still not hot enough.
瑞秋  怎样  你看他012---Rachel. Okay, look at him.
你看那双有力的手012---Look at those strong hands.
我真想当那瓶…炼乳012---Oh, what I wouldn't give to be that can of condensed milk.
妈  钱德说你的毛衣很好看012---Mom, uh, Chandler was just saying how beautiful your sweater is.
谢谢你  这是新衣服012---Oh, thank you, Chandler. I just bought it.
是吗  很漂亮  米色的  很紧012---Oh. Yes, well, it's very beautiful and it's cream-colored and tight and...
我不是指很紧  不会很紧  我没有在看012---I don't mean tight. It's not too tight. Not that I was looking at...
他是怎么搞的012---What's the matter with him?
大概又嗑药了012---I think he's stoned again.
什么  什么012---What? What?
我有事要告诉你012---Dude, I need to talk to you a sec.
我大概知道  我爸妈为什么不喜欢你了012---Okay, I think I might know why my parents don't like you.
是吗  为什么  记不记得我们年轻的时候012---You do? Why? Okay, remember we were young. Heh.
大二的春假  我在房间里吸麻012---Spring break, sophomore year, I got high in my bedroom...
我爸妈走进来闻到了012---...and my parents walked in and smelled it...
于是我就说你吸了麻   跳窗走了012---...so I told them that you had gotten stoned and jumped out the window.
什么  你为什么要赖给我012---What? Why did you do that?
我不知道  我第一个想到你012---I don't know. Uh, yours was the first name that popped into my head.
对不起  我以为不会怎样012---I'm sorry. I didn't think it'd matter.
怎么可能不会怎样012---How could it not matter?
我怎么知道我们会变成死党012---How was I to know we'd be friends after college...
更别提你会跟我妹同居012---...let alone you'd be living with my sister?
那些 "生死之交"的豪语呢012---What about all that "friends forever" stuff?
不晓得  我当时正嗨012---I don't know. I was all high.
爸妈叫我来看看  你是不是想找罗斯嗑药012---Mom and Dad just sent me to find out if you were trying to get Ross stoned.
罗斯大学吸麻被他们逮到  他居然赖给我012---Your parents caught Ross smoking pot in college, and he blamed it on me.
罗斯  你怎么能这样012---Ross, I can't believe you'd do that.
他们讨厌我  我们才没公开  麻烦你搞定012---We haven't told them we're together because they hate me, okay? So you fix this.
好啦  我会说吸麻的不是钱德012---Okay, okay, I'll tell them it wasn't Chandler who got high.
那我要说是谁呢012---Now, who should I say it was?
你  这又没什么  你现在又没有嗑药012---You. It's not like it's a big deal. You don't still do it or anything.
好啦  好啦  那我要说是谁骗我这么做的012---All right. Now, who should I say tricked me into doing it?
爸012---Dad.
请别在这里剔牙012---Dad, please don't pick your teeth out here.
如果你要翘脚  怎么不坐   摩妮卡  不要烦他012---And if you're gonna put your feet up-Monica, leave him alone.
你快点  好吗012---Will you hurry up?
你之前没听到我说  吉宁的朋友都是舞者吗012---Did you not hear me when I told you that all of Janine's friends are dancers?
而且她们会喝很多酒012---Huh? And that they're gonna be drinking a lot?
我是听到了  不过你再说一次  好浪漫012---No, I did. But tell me again because it's so romantic.
你打得好慢  不能快一点吗012---You're whipping so slow. Can't you do it any faster?
乔伊  我不想犯错012---Joey, come on, I don't want to make any mistakes.
甜点只有这一道   要是我搞砸   大家会说012---This is the only dessert. If I screw it up, everybody's gonna be like:
"记得那次感恩节  瑞秋把酒果酱松糕做坏了"012---"Oh, remember that Thanksgiving when Rachel screwed up the trifle?"
所以让我来做  你只管担心吃的部分012---So just let me worry about making the trifle and you just worry about eating it.alright?
我是很担心012---Oh, I am.
罗斯  你再不说  我就要说了  好啦012---Ross, if you don't tell them, then I will. Okay. Fine.
罗斯  你可以来一下吗012---Ross, can I talk to you for a second? Oh, uh...
等一下好吗   乔伊  我有事要告诉我爸吗012---Can it wait a second, Joey? I have to tell my parents something.
不能等  好吧012---No, it can't? Okay.
我觉得我们应该告诉瑞秋  她甜点做错了012---Okay, look, I think we have to tell Rachel she messed up her dessert.
什么  大家都是怎么了012---What? What is with everybody?
今天是感恩节  不是012---It's Thanksgiving, not...
告秘日012---...Truth Day.
等大家吃到那道香蕉肉甜点012---Look, when everyone eats that banana-meat thing...
一定会取笑她  那样的话也好吗012---...they'll all make fun of her. Do you want that?
好  我们就叫大家假装喜欢012---Okay. We'll just get everyone to act like they like it.
那样就不会有人取笑她012---That way, no one makes fun of her...
我们也可以去找那些小辣椒012---...and we still get to go to sweet potato pie.
兄弟  别把她们物化012---Dude, they're not objects.
好012---Oh.
开玩笑的  我去告诉大家  你把瑞秋拖开012---Just kidding. I'll talk to them. You distract her.
瑞秋  可以出去谈一下吗012---Hey, Rach, can I talk to you outside for a sec'?
好吧012---0Kay.
什么事  罗斯012---What's up, Ross?
所以012---So, um...
感恩节012---Thanksgiving.
岁末季节又来了012---The holiday season is upon us, hmm?
是啊012---Yeah.
还有012---And, um...
你今天很漂亮012---...you look nice today.
不  不  罗斯  不要这样  什么012---Oh, no. No, Ross, don't do this. What?
我觉得我们不适合复合了012---I just don't think us getting back together is a good idea.
嗯012---Huh?
我早就料到会这样012---I thought this might happen today.
罗斯  我知道逢年过节特别难熬012---Ross, I know the holidays can be rough...
而且你一个人八成很辛苦012---...and it's probably really hard for you to be alone right now.
你也是一个人012---You're alone.
不  我跟菲比住012---No, I live with Phoebe.
你就真的只有一个人012---I mean, you're alone-alone.
好吗  但这个时机真的不对   抱歉012---And it's just not the time for us. I'm sorry.
我总得试试看012---Oh, well. Can't blame a guy for trying.
要是有人不知道怎么装012---And, uh, if anyone needs help pretending to like it...
我在表演课学过  你们可以摸摸肚子012---...I learned some things in acting class. Try, uh, rubbing your stomach.
或是说 "嗯"012---Or, uh, saying "Mm."
加上微笑012---And, uh, oh, smiling.
好啊012---Okay?
我再也不花钱  让你去上表演课了012---Yeah, I'm not gonna pay for those acting classes anymore.
瑞秋  你回来了  快上甜点吧012---Rachel, there you are. Come on, Let's serve that dessert already.
乔伊   别再催我了  你知道吗   罚你不准吃012---Joey, you have to stop rushing me. You know what? You don't get any dessert.
是么012---Really?
骗你的  我才不会虐待你012---No, just kidding. I would never do that to you.
好  各位  酒果酱松糕时间到012---Okay, everybody, it's trifle time.
这是英式酒果酱松糕  对吧012---So, now, Rach, this is a traditional English trifle, isn't it?
一点也没错012---It sure is. Wow.
那你是加牛肉还是茄子012---So did you make it with beef or eggplant?
牛肉  我不能吃  你也知道我不吃肉012---Beet I can't have any. I don't eat meat. Oh.
哦012---Aw.
摩妮卡  我要你第一个品尝012---Monica, I want you to have the first taste.
是吗012---Really?
等等  你只挖了鲜奶油012---Wait, you only got whipped cream.
你得挖到每一层012---You gotta take a bite with all the layers.
好012---0Kay.
等等  你掉了一颗豌豆012---You dropped a pea.
怎么样012---Well?
嗯012---Mm.
好好吃012---It's good.
真的吗  多好吃012---Really? How good?
好吃到012---It's so good that I feel really selfish...
我一个人吃会过意不去012---...about being the only one who's eating it.
我们应该让每个人都享用012---I think we should have everyone taste how good it is.
尤其是罗斯012---Especially Ross.
真是太好吃了  我要去阳台吃012---Yeah. This is so good that I'm gonna go enjoy it on the balcony.
边看风景边享用012---So that I can enjoy the view whilst I enjoy my dessert.
我要去房里打电话012---I've gotta call my friend...
告诉我的朋友玛丽有多好吃012---...and tell her how good this is from Monica's room.
我帮你拨号012---I'll help you dial.
我要去浴室012---I'm gonna go into the bathroom...
边吃边照镜子012---...so I can look at it in the mirror as I eat it.
这是怎么回事  不好吃吗012---Okay, what was that all about? Does it not taste good?
我吃吃看  什么  不行012---Let me try it. No, no.
都没了012---All gone.
好好吃012---So good.
也许钱德还有剩的012---Maybe Chandler has some left.
味道好像洗脚水012---It tastes like feet.
我喜欢012---I like it.
不是吧012---Are you kidding?
有什么不好  乳蛋糕  赞012---What's not to like? Custard, good.
果酱  赞  牛肉  赞012---Jam, good. Meat, good.
一只乌就这样一把抢过去012---So a bird just grabbed it...
想带着它飞走012---...and then tried to fly away with it...
结果就掉到马路上了012---...and then just dropped it on the street?
对  不过值得安慰的是  掉下去之前012---Yes, but, if it's any consolation, before the bird dropped it...
他好像吃得很开心012---...he seemed to enjoy it.
瑞秋  来一下012---Rachel, come here.
好012---0Kay.
我刚刚小睡了一觉  又梦到杰克012---I was just taking my Thanksgiving nap and I had another dream about Jack.
菲比  我会想听吗  我不知道  你听听看012---Phoebe, do I want to hear this? I don't know, let's see.
所以  我梦到我们正要结婚012---Okay, I dreamt we were getting married...
结果他离开去救火012---...and he left because he had to go fight a fire.
所以我去一家夜总会  却看到他在跟一个女孩亲热012---And, um, so, okay, I went to a nightclub and I saw him making outwith a girl.
天哪  他在梦里背叛你012---Oh, my God, he dream-cheated on you.
对  但这时贾克库斯托出现012---Yeah. But then Jacques Cousteau came...
帮我教训了他一顿012---...and he kicked his ass for betraying me.
好酷喔012---It was so cool.
然后他带我去潜水  跟我介绍他养的海马012---Then he took me diving and introduced me to his pet sea horse...
他一直对我献殷勤  但是怎么可能012---...who was coming on to me. And, please, that is not gonna happen.
幸好我今天系了大皮带012---Boy, I'm glad I wore the big belt today.
五分钟前  那种话会让我神魂颠倒012---Five minutes ago, a line like that would have floored me.
现在却毫无作用   一点点啦  我毕竟是女人012---But now, nothing. Well, not nothing. I am still a woman.
罗斯  来吧012---Ross? Let's go.
关于告诉爸妈这件事012---Oh, yeah. About telling Mom and Dad...
我考虑用写信的方式012---...I was thinking about maybe writing a letter.
够了  我给过你机会012---You know what? That's it. You've had your chance.
妈  爸  罗斯大学吸过麻012---Mom, Dad. Ross smoked pot in college.
什么  什么012---What? What?
你这个告密者012---You are such a tattletale.
妈  爸012---Mom, Dad, heh...
记得你们在我房里012---...you remember that time you walked in my room...
闻到大麻的事吗012---...and smelled marijuana?
记得 记得012---Yes. Yes.
我说吸麻的是钱德012---I told you it was Chandler...
其实012---...who was smoking the pot but...
是我  对不起012---...it was me. I'm sorry.
是你012---It was you?
还有  害他被革职的邮差012---And, Dad, you know that mailman that you got fired?
他没有偷你的《花花公子》   是罗斯偷的012---He didn't steal your Playboys. Ross did.
前廊的秋千椅不是暴风雨弄坏的  是摩妮卡坐坏的012---Well, Hurricane Gloria didn't break the porch swing. Monica did.
罗斯已经离开博物馆一年了012---Ross hasn't worked at the museum for a year.
摩妮卡和钱德在同居012---Monica and Chandler are living together!
罗斯在赌城娶了瑞秋  然后又离婚了  又一次012---Ross married Rachel in Vegas. And got divorced. Again!
我爱贾克库斯托012---I love Jacques Cousteau.
酒果酱松糕里不该放牛肉的012---I wasn't supposed to put beef in the trifle.
我想走啦012---I want to go!
这三十秒真是高潮不断啊012---That's a lot of information to get in 3O seconds.
好  乔伊  你想走就走吧012---All right. Joey, if you want to leave, just leave.
瑞秋  这道甜点的确不能放肉012---Rachel, no, you weren't supposed to put beef in the trifle.
一点也不好吃012---It did not taste good.
菲比  很抱歉012---Phoebe, I'm sorry...
贾克库斯托已经死了012---...but I think Jacques Cousteau is dead.
摩妮卡  我真不懂  你为何012---Monica, why you felt you had to hide the fact...
要隐瞒一段重要的感情012---...that you're in an important relationship is beyond me.
其实秋千椅的事我们心里有数012---And we kind of figured about the porch swing.
罗斯012---Ross.
嗑药012---Drugs?
三度离婚012---Divorced again?
你是怎么了  儿子012---What happened, son?
我都是遭人哄骗012---L-I, uh-I got tricked into all those things.
钱德  你一直是罗斯的好朋友012---Chandler, you've been Ross' best friend all these years...
在他嗑药时仍不放弃他012---...stuck by him during the drug problems...
现在你又照顾起摩妮卡012---...and now you've taken on Monica as well.
我不知道该说什么012---Well, I don't know what to say.
你真是个大好人012---You're a wonderful human being.
谢谢你  不012---Thank you. No.
是谢谢你012---Thank you.
摩妮卡  罗斯  我真不知道该拿你们怎么办012---Monica and Ross, I don't know what I'm gonna do about the two of you.
我会跟他们谈012---I'll talk to them.
各位  香蕉012---You guys, it was bananas...
奶油加牛肉012---...cream and beef.
你们居然因为怕我难过而吃掉012---I just cannot believe that you ate that so that I wouldn't feel bad.
其实我没吃  还放在浴室里012---Well, actually, I didn't eat mine. It's still in the bathroom.
没有  我吃掉了012---No it isn't, I ate that.
我们的在摩妮卡的房里012---And we left ours in Monica's bedroom.
没有  被我吃了  你的也是012---Nope, got it and got yours too.
请问现在为何都用小灯泡012---Let me ask you, Why is everybody using these tiny, little lights nowadays?
我记得以前都用大灯泡012---I remember when people used big lights.
钱德爷爷话当年012---That's a good story, Grandpa.
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
摩妮卡让别人布置她的圣诞树012---Wow. Monica's letting other people help decorate her tree?
谁又把她灌醉了吗012---Did someone get her drunk again, or...?
圣诞节的意义不在于圣诞树012---Having a perfectly decorated tree is not what Christmas is about.
而在于  与所爱的人共度012---It's about being with the people that you love.
真好  布置好了012---That is nice. And we're done. Ta-da!
我总觉得它少了一股圣诞味012---I dunno what it is, It just doesn't quite feel like Christmas to me.
那这样呢012---Oh, here.
这样才像圣诞节012---See, now it feels like Christmas.
老友记  第六季  第10集  舞林高手012---Friends  S06E10  The One With The Routinue
这就是犹太陀螺的由来012---And that's the story of the dreidel.
有些人说圣诞树源自古埃及012---Now, Some people trace the Christmas tree back to the Egyptians...
在每年白昼最短的日子  他们会把棕榈枝带进屋里012---...who'd bring palm branches into huts on the shortest day of the year...
象征生命战胜死亡012---...symbolizing life's triumph over death.
那是4千年前的事了012---And that was, like, 4000 years ago.
你开始讲古代  也差不多是那个时候012---So, pretty much around the same time that you started telling this story.
大家好  乔伊  怎么了012---Hey, you guys. Hey. What's up?
我不出门不行啊  吉宁在房间到处拉筋折腾012---I had to get out of the apartment. Janine's stretching all over the place.
随便一转头就看到她在012---Everywhere I look she's like...
难怪你无法抗拒012---I can see why that's hard to resist.
我好喜欢她012---I like her so much.
可惜她对你没感觉012---Aw, I'm sorry sweetie that she doesn’t feel the same way.
就是啊  她好可爱012---I know. And she's so sweet.
我好想喂她吃葡萄  帮她梳头012---I just want to feed her grapes and brush her hair.
你知道她不是猴子吧012---You are aware that she's not a monkey, right?
我已经对吉宁没感觉了012---I am so over Janine.
我原来觉得她火辣性感  但现在  没这回事了012---I mean, Yeah, at first I thought she was hot, but now she's like old news.
你们好  吉宁012---Hey, guys. Janine!
我刚接到除夕特别节目的通告012---I'm gonna be a dancer on a TV special for New Year's Eve.
叫什么狄克摇滚狄奇之夜的012---It's called some sort of Dickin' Rockin' Dicky Eve.
慢着012---Hold it.
是《狄克克拉克新年摇滚之夜》吗012---Are you talking about Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve?
那不是我说的吗012---Yeah, that's what I said.
天哪  我们爱死那个节目了012---Oh, my God, we love that show!
从我有记忆以来  罗斯和我每年都看012---Ross and I have been watching it since I can remember.
内心深处的你还是个小胖妹  对吧012---Ah, you're still just a little fat girl inside, aren't you?
我今年要去  我要当狂欢派对来宾012---Well I'm gonna be on it this year. I'm gonna be one of the party people.
你要去当派对来宾   那些人最酷了012---You're gonna be a party person? Those guys rock the most!
他们叫我带人去  你愿意当我的舞伴吗012---Well they said to bring someone. Do you wanna be my dance partner?
当然了  我很愿意跟你跨年012---Totally! I would love to spend New Year's with you.
明天就要录影了  我也不太懂012---Well actually they're taping tomorrow. I don't understand why--
流程是这样的012---Well, how it works is...
时代广场的部分是现场直播012---...the part with Dick Clark in Times Square is actually live.
但他们会预录狂欢派对的画面012---But they tape some of the party stuff ahead of time.
知道的人并不多012---Yeah, Not a lot of people know that.
你们也想去吗012---Do you guys want to come too?
真的还假的  一言为定012---Are you serious? We are there!
你笑什么笑012---What are you laughing at?
我跟他交往过  但你还跟她在一起012---Well, I used to date him, but you're still going outwith her.
谢谢  那我们就一起去012---Thanks. Great, so we can all go together.
我得走了  回头见012---I gotta run. catch you later.
再见  吉宁012---Bye, Janine.
她是不是约我出去012---Did she just ask me out on a date?
应该不是012---I don't think so.
什么啊  她找他参加的可是千禧年最盛大的晚会啊012---What are you talking about? She invited him to the biggest party of the millennium.
但她也找了你和罗斯012---Yeah, but she also invited you and Ross.
很抱歉  那应该不算约会012---Yeah, honey, I'm sorry, I don't think that that was a romantic thing.
或许吧  但我有一个办法012---Well, maybe. But, hey, I know how I can find out.
我们不是要参加跨年晚会012---We're going to a New Year's Eve party, right? 
到了午夜  我可以亲她  要是她也回吻  漂亮012---So at midnight, I can kiss her. And if she kisses me back, great.
要是她说 "你干什么"012---If she says, "Dude, what the hell are you doing?"
我就说 "不是我  都是新年害的"012---I can say, "it wasn't me, it was New Year's."
比高中时罗斯想亲我要好012---Well, that's a lot better than Ross kissing me in high school...
他说他需要护唇膏012---...and saying that he did it because he needed Chap Stick.
那天很干燥012---It was a dry day.
我们要上《狄克克拉克新年摇滚之夜》012---We are going to Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve!
我的天哪012---Oh, my God!
我的天哪012---Oh, my God!
我的天啊012---Oh, my God!
听着  我录过影012---Okay, I've been on sets before...
我有些建议012---...so let me give you a little advice, alright?
虽然只是上电视  我们只管跳舞  没什么大不了的012---It's a show, but we're just dancing. It's no big deal.
最重要的是  耍酷012---Important thing to remember: Stay cool.
了解  好012---Got it. Okay.
天哪  跟我梦想的一样012---Oh, my God! It's just like I dreamed it!
全体集合012---Everyone! Gather up!
借过  借过012---Excuse us! Excuse us!
我们的做法是  音乐一放  你们就跳舞012---Here's what's gonna happen.The music's gonna start, you're gonna dance...
我们会录影  你们不要看镜头  有问题吗012---...we'll tape it. Don't look at the camera. Any questions?
我有  什么时候播出012---Uh, yeah, I have a question. Uh, when is this gonna air?
好  你们去那边跳012---Yeah. Now, uh, you guys dance over there...
你们  去那边跳  你们两个在这里012---...you guys, over there. and I want you two right around here,
其他人散开  罗斯012---And everyone else, spread out. Ross.
什么时候播出012---So when is it gonna air?
你找厨房  我找后面的柜子012---Okay, you look in the kitchen, I will look in the back closet.
不必浪费时间了  我在这里012---I can save you time, ladies. I'm right here.
钱德  你出去一下  这件事与你无关012---Yeah. Chandler why don't you take a walk? This doesn't concern you.
我们在找摩妮卡送的圣诞礼物012---We're looking for our presents from Monica.
什么  太差劲了012--- What? That's terrible!
不会  我们每年都找012---No-no, we do it every year!
那就不差劲了012---Oh, well, that makes it not terrible.
但我们从来就没找到过012---No, yeah, we never find them.
她老是打败我们  奸诈的查某012---She's always best at us that wily minx.
放心  我们找个l小时012---Don't worry, we're just gonna search here for an hour..
就会换到乔伊那边找  好吗012---...and then we'll go to Joey's and search, okay?
不好  你们不能找她送的礼物  我们一定要找012---No not okay, You can't look for Monica's presents.But we have to!
你们不一定要找  也不能找  因为我也住在这里012---No, you don’t have to, And you can't, because I live here too.
那你应该跟我们一起找012---Well, then you should look with us.
为什么012---Why?
钱德  你都不愁要送摩妮卡什么吗012---Chandler, Aren't you worried about what to get Monica for Christmas?
不会  我有个很棒的构想012---No, I have a great idea for a present for her.
就只有  很棒的构想  嗯012---Oh, that's it? A great idea? Oh, yeah?
那样是不够的  要是她送你一个大礼012---Chandler, that's not enough. I mean what if she gets you a great present...
两个普通礼和一堆小礼呢012---...two medium presents, and a bunch of little presents?
而你只送她一个大礼  她一定会很难过012---And you've just gotten her one great present? I mean that's just gonna make her feel bad.
那你为什么要让她难过  为什么  为什么012---Why would you do that to her Chandler? Why? Why?
有我帮忙  找得更快  没错012---If I help, we can find them faster! That's right!
逮到一个了012---Ooh! Ooh! We have a live one!
是梅西百货的袋子  对012---Oh, it's a Macy's bag! Yeah.
这是给谁的012---Aw! Ooh! Who's it for?
"亲爱的  你们真以为我会藏在沙发下012---"Dear Losers, do you really think I'd hide presents under the couch?
还有  钱德  我就知道你会让步"012---P.S. Chandler, I knew they'd break you."
她可能已经发现了012---Uh-oh. She may be onto us.
我们今年一定要找到012---We are so gonna find them this year.
你们刚才说会到对面去找   该不会是每年都去吧012---Y'know when you guys said you were gonna go across the hall and look. you don’t, you don’t do that every year do you?
是啊012---Yeah.
你们没有到我的柜子里面012---You don't, like go into the back of my closet...
翻我的健身袋底下吧012---...and look under my gym bag or anything?
没有  从来没有012---No. Never do that.
乔伊会托我保管东西  我看都没看过012---Because that's where Joey gave me some stuff to store that I've never seen before in my life! 
刚才的事是幻觉012---Okay, that did not just happen.
又有摄影机来了012---Okay, here comes another camera.
好  小意思  放轻松012---Right. No biggie. Stay loose.
他们为什么一直避开012---Why do they keep doing that? Ugh!
想上镜头就得上那些平台012---If we wanna get on camera, I think we have to get up on one of those platforms. 
他们一直拍平台上的人012---They've been taping those people up there all day.
没错012---Right.
你们为什么能上去012---Hey, what'd you guys do to get up on there?
我们有练过012---We learned how to dance.
你练舞时也忘了穿内裤吗012---Oh yeah? Well when you learned how to dance did you forget how to put on underpants?
对嘛012---Yeah!
你跳得很好嘛  是吗012---Hey, you're a good dancer. Really?
臀部再放松一点会更好012---Yeah, well you’d be better if you just loosened your hips a little.
怎么说   像这样012---What do you mean? Like this.
就是这样  跟着节奏摆动  好多了012---That's it. Feel the rhythm. That's better.
你去跟那个女生跳012---Okay, you’re dancing with that girl over there.
不  我们是一起来的  我们是一起的012---No-no-no-no-no we're together. Yeah, we came together.
我看不出来012---I don't see it.
你去跟那个高个子跳  高个子  举手012---You are dancing with the tall guy over there. Tall Guy, raise your hand!
不  老兄  拜托让我跟她跳  我很喜欢她  我觉得我有机会012---No-no hey buddy, please let me dance with that girl, I really like her and I think I have a shot..
真的  你觉得有  我觉得没有012---Really, you think so? I don't.
乔伊那里什么都没   等一下012---I couldn't find anything at Joey--Hey-hey, oh hey!
我们找到了012---Yeah, we found them.
在客房衣橱的外套后面012---They were in the guest room closet behind some coats.
你不必担心了  都是些烂东西012---Yeah, and you have nothing to worry about 'cos they're all crap!
那是我要送给你们的礼物012---Those are my gifts, I got them for you.
谢谢  钱德  好棒喔012---Oh. Thanks, Chandler, they're great!
这个奇怪的金属AZ是什么012---Well Chandler, what is this very weird, urn, metal A-Z thing?
那是书挡  是很棒的礼物012---Those are book ends. That's a great gift.
好  抱歉  谢谢你送的AZ (AZ音近屁股ass)012---Oh. Okay, I'm sorry. Thank you for my "az."
记得都放回衣柜里  好吧012---Make sure you put all that stuff back in the closet. okay.
好吗  好啦012---Yes, okay.
对了  你人真好  都搬家了012---By the way, I just gotta say, I think it's really nice of you that even after you moved...
还帮着乔伊保管东西012---...you still keep storing that stuff for Joey.
喂  舞女012---Hey, dancing girl?
我想上厕所012---Can I go to the bathroom?
来转一下012---Here we go. Yeah.
很辣喔  盖勒兄妹012---Looking good, Gellers!
还用你说012---We know!
你看那个脾气急躁的人  他专门指定上平台的人012---Hey, see that snippy guy over there? He's the one who decides who gets up on the platform.
我们应该去他面前跳  好012---We should go dance by him. Okay.
全部暂停012---Okay, everybody, hold!
接下来上平台的舞者有012---Next on the platforms are...

请问一下012---Excuse me? Sir?
如果我不穿内裤会入选吗  摩妮卡012---Would it help if I weren't wearing underpants? Monica! 
会吗012---Would it?
高个子012---Hey, Tall Guy!
我想跟你聊聊你的舞伴012---listen, I want to talk to you about that girl you're dancing with.
她真不赖   我还差点带老婆来012---She's nice, huh? To think I almost brought my wife to this.
是啊  好012---Yeah. Yeah. Okay.
老兄   我和她是一起来的012---Uh, look buddy, I came with that girl, okay?
我想在新年倒计数时吻她012---and I had this plan to kiss her at the new years countdown.
我想追她012---I'm trying to win her over. you know--
不行012---No I don’t think so.
拜托啦  你可以跟我的舞伴跳012---Oh come on man, you can dance with my partner.
她跳得超级棒012---she's real, uh, mellow!
你在跟这个女生交往吗012---Look, are you dating this girl you came with?
我希望过了今晚可以012---I was hoping after tonight that maybe I could you know...
不  不  那就公平竞争  抱歉012---No. No. She's fair game if you ask me. Sorry, buddy.
好吧  嘿012---All right. Hey.
公平竞争  你说的对  我还能说什么012---y'know fair is fair,if you're right, you're right, what can I say,
嘿  不012---but hey oh no!
你是小学生吗012---Are you in second grade?

要是弄得老爸老妈如此嫉妒  最后却没上电视012---If Mom and Dad don't see us on TV after we made them jealous...
到时候谁是失败者012---...then who's gonna be the losers then?
我知道怎么上平台了  怎样012---Hey, I know what'll get us up on a platform. What?
跳招牌舞012---The routine!
我们中学毕业后就没跳过了012---Ross, we haven't done the routine since middle school.

搭都会帮我们搭一座平台012---...he'll want to build us our own platform.
有那么赞吗012---Was it that good?
我们得了兄弟姊妹组的特别奖012---We got honorable mention in the brother-sister dance category!
假午夜快到了  我们还能怎样012---It's almost fake midnight. Do we really have any other choice?

我也有012---Me too!
回到现场时012---When the music starts up again...

你们好012---On, hi, guys!
乌类的方向感很好012---Y'know, Birds have a very good sense of direction.
或许他们可以帮忙找出礼物012---and I thought maybe they could help us find where the presents are hidden.
如果礼物藏在南方过冬的话012---Yes, if the presents are hidden south for the winter.
顺着你的笑话去找也行  你知道在哪里吗  当然不知道012---Or we could just follow your clever jokes. Any ideas? Didn't think so.
来  把礼物找出来012---Come on, show us where the presents are.
鸭子似乎认为摩妮卡送我垃圾012---Oh, the duck seems to think that Monica got me garbage.
什么样的回礼能跟垃圾一样好012---I wonder what I could get Monica that's as good as garbage.
我的AZ如何012---Hmm. How about my “at”?
这是空的  什么012---Hey. This is hollow. What?
这排座椅  是空心的  我居然都不知道012---This bench, it's hollow. I can't believe I never knew that!
我们的礼物  不要直视它们012---Oh, the presents! Don't look directly at them!
什么012---What?
没事  不  可以看012---All right, no, we could look at them.
这是我的012---This one's for me!

我不想知道摩妮卡送我什么012---I don't want to know what Monica got me.Y'know? I mean,look.
她一定很用心的替我找礼物  想给我惊喜012---I'm sure she worked hard at getting it and wanting to surprise me.
你们这样会坏了情绪012---And you guys are gonna ruin that.and I,
我们得把礼物放回去  这样不叫圣诞节012---look we have to put them back. this is not what Christmas is about.
谁理你  我要拆我的012---Whatever, Linus. I'm opening mine.
谁也不准拆012---Nobody is opening anything, okay?
但我想看摩妮卡  收到礼物的表情012---I want to see the look on Monica's face when I give her my present.
她一定也想看  我收到礼物的表情012---I'm sure she wants to see the look on my face when I get mine.
所以求求你们放回去  好吗012---So, please, please, can we just...? Can we put them back?
你会送我们更好的礼物吗   好啦012---Will you get us better gifts? Fine.
我回来了012---Hey, guys.

你知道那个滤水器多难找吗012---Do you know how long it took me to find you that water purifier?
你送我滤水器  这下我懂了  那种表情无价012---That's what you got me? Yes, I see. That look is priceless.

乔伊  怎样012---Joey? Yeah?

这是干什么012---What was that for?
今晚当他们喊卡  我们没能接吻012---Tonight when they yelled "cut" and we didn't get to kiss...
我真的很失望  我真的012---...I was really, really disappointed, and I just...
真的很想亲你012---I just really wanted to kiss you.
真的012---Really?
那时候  我也很想亲你  那时候012---In the moment, I really wanted to kiss you too. In the moment.
那时候  只有那时候012---In the moment. But only in the moment.
你  想再亲一次吗012---So do you, uh, want to kiss again?
想啊  离除夕只有两个星期012---Sure. New Year's Eve is only two weeks away.
你能等吗012---Can you wait?
不能012---No.
我也是012---Me neither.
3   2012---Three, two...
乔伊  不必每次接吻都倒数012---Joey, you don't have to count down every time we kiss.
好012---Oh. Okay.
但我觉得  我需要几秒钟做准备012---Except I sort of felt like I needed a couple seconds to get ready.
我们在平台上  准备带全世界跳进千禧年012---We were on the platform, ready to dance into the new millennium...
那家伙却喊了卡012---...and the guy yells "cut!"
等等  你们真的跳了012---So you guys are telling me that you actually did...
八年级的招牌舞012---...the routine from eighth grade?
对  不过当然得稍做修正012---Yeah! But of course we had to update it a little bit.
你反应真快  知道要接住我012---Hey, by the way, quick thinking about catching me.
我正想说  你们绝不可能012---‘Cos I was gonna say there's no way you could've done the end...
照以前的结尾跳012---...the way you guys did it back then.
什么  当然可以012---What? We could do it.
不行吧  你以前胖的 壮的多了012---I don't know. You were a lot bigger-I mean, stronger back then.

嘿012---Hey.
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
我想知道012---Listen, uh...
你们觉得我追得到吉宁吗012---do you guys think I have a chance with Janine?
我们讨论过这件事了012---Honey, we have been through this before!
对啊  别折磨自己了012---Yeah. Don't do this to yourself.
她已经明确表示不可能了012---She’s made it pretty clear, it is not going to happen.
那我刚刚吻了她012---All right, then. I guess I shouldn't get too excited about the fact...
也不该太兴奋了012---...that I just kissed her!
真的假的啊  太好了012---Are you serious? That's great!
还得观察012---Yeah, well, we'll see.

幸好你说的是厨艺  对吧012---I'm so glad you said "cooks." Right?
瑞秋  你得通知邮局你搬家了012---Oh hey Rachel, sweetheart? you've got to tell the post office that you've moved.

瑞秋  菲比最讨厌陶瓷货仓了012---Rach, Phoebe hates Pottery Barn.
我也讨厌陶瓷货仓012---I hate Pottery Barn too.
我才在床上坐坐  就被赶了出去012---They kicked me out just because I sat on a bed.

我很困啊012---I was tired.
菲比讨厌陶瓷货仓012---Phoebe hates Pottery Barn?

她觉得她的家俱  应该要有历史  要有典故012---She thinks her furniture should have a history, a story behind it.
这有典故啊012---Well this has a story behind it.
这是大老远从白原店运来的012---I mean they had to ship it all the way from the White Plains store.
她喜欢独一无二012---It’s gotta be one of a kind.
就像她那个丑到爆的水果陶碗012---Y'know like umm, y'know uh, what's that God awful ceramic fruit bowl she has on her counter?
那是我做的012---Hey! I made that for her.
你会捏陶   对012---You made pottery? Yeah.
是从垃圾堆捡来的啦012---I made it out of a fruit bowl I found in the garbage.
你把桌子搬回家  肯定会被念到死012---I'm telling -- If you put that in her apartment, you'll never hear the end of it.
好  我就说那是古董012---Okay fine! I'll-I'll just tell her that it's an antique apothecary table.
她也不必知道它的出处012---She doesn't have to know where it came from.
你看  我爱死这些小抽屉了012---Ah, I love these drawers.
上面说可以放三百张CD012---Oh, look! It says that it holds 300 CDs.
正如往昔的药师桌012---Ah, just like the apothecary tables of yore.
然后农夫说012---So the farmer says:
"那不是母牛  你也不是在挤奶"012---"That's not a cow, and you're not milking."
你们能在一起真好012---I am so glad you guys got together,

摩妮卡和钱德有什么不好012---What-what’s wrong with Monica and Chandler?
不晓得  他们就是有点012---I don’t know, they're just a little...
哈啦012---...blah!
哈啦012---Blah?
他很哈啦  她012---Well, you know, he's blah. She's just...
她很娇小  嗓门却很大012---She's very loud for such a small person.
他们是我最要好的朋友012---Uh, they're my best friends.
我们不能跟他们往来吗  那可就麻烦了012---Are you saying we can't hang out with them? 'Cause that'd be a problem.
不是  往来当然可以012---No! Of course we can still hang out with them.
只是不要连续两晚012---Just y'know, not two nights in a row.
好吗  好吧012---Okay? I guess.
谢谢012---Thank you.
要我卖了朋友  给你买礼物都行012---If you want, I'll sell my friends and use the money to buy you presents.
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
好棒的桌子  在哪里买的012---Ooh! What a great table! Where did you get it?
你猜012---Guess.
跳蚤市场012---Um, a flea market?
我就知道你会一猜即中012---Ha, See, I knew, I knew you would get it on the first guess.
很酷吧   这是药师桌012---Isn't it cool? It's an apothecary table.
哇哦012---Wow!
你可以想像  他们就是把药材012---Oh you can just imagine that this is where...
存放在这里面012---...they kept all their stuff to make potions.
你知道  对啊012---You know? Ooh, yes.
几乎能闻到鸦片的味道012---Ooh, you can almost smell the opium.
就是啊012---Almost.
多少钱012---Oh, how much was it?
才5百012---Just only 500 bucks.
跳蚤市场买的要5百012---500 bucks at a flea market?
我以为你是问012---Oh, okay see I thought,I thought you meant how much was it...
当年  全新时候的价钱012---...when it was new, y'know like back then
不是  就是说嘛012---Oh, no. Yeah, no.
因为是跳蚤市场   所以差不多1块钱012---I mean it was at a flea market, so it was y'know, it was like a dollar.
1块钱  再加50元012---A dollar? And fifty?
总共51元012---So it was like one and fifty dollars.
他们用古法算钱  对012---Ohh, okay, they gave you the old-time pricing. Yeah.
这是哪个年代的012---Well, what period is it from?
往昔年代012---Uh, it's from yore.
就是 "往昔的时代"  知道吗012---Like, the "days of yore," you know?
对  我知道012---Yes, I do.
天哪  真是太完美了012---It's just perfect. Oh, good.
这一定有很棒的典故012---Wow! I bet it has a great story behind it too.
卖方有提到它的出处或者012---Did they tell you anything? Like y’know where it was from or...
有  这个我知道  它来自白原012---Yes, that I know. This is from, uh, White Plains.
白原012---White Plains. Mm-hm.
听起来好神奇的一个地方012---Ooh, it sounds like such a magical place.
我来了012---Hey! I'm here. Hi!
我的天哪012---Oh, my God!
你喜欢吗   完了012---You like it? Oh, my God!
这是我的新药师桌012---It's my new apothecary table!
罗斯  菲比就快到了  不能让她看到012---Ross! Phoebe'll be here any second. She can't see this.
为什么  她一定会喜欢  这是好东西012---Well why not?! She'll love it. It's the real thing.
是在陶瓷货仓买的012---I got it at Pottery Barn.
我知道  我也买了一张012---I know you did! I bought the same one.
她看到你的桌子  就会知道我骗她012---And if she sees your table she's gonna know that I lied to her. 
我说我们的是原版  为什么012---I told her ours was an original. Why did you do that?
因为她讨厌陶瓷货仓012---Because she hates Pottery Barn.
她讨厌陶瓷货仓012---She hates Pottery Barn?
我也很惊讶  她说那是量产012---I know! I know, She says it's all mass-produced...
没有真品  大家买的都一样012---...nothing is authentic, and everyone winds up having the same stuff.
她随时都会进来  拿个东西先盖住  好吗012---So come on! she's gonna be here any second! Can we please just cover this up with something?! Please?
什么  不  不要012---What? No, no.
我才不要遮遮掩掩的012---I am not gonna hide it from Phoebe.
不过我也买了很漂亮的床单012---Although I did get some great Pottery Barn sheets.
我忘了他们也出床单012---Ooh, I forgot they made sheets!
废话012---Heh, yeah.
她居然会讨厌陶瓷货仓012---I still can't believe she hates Pottery Barn.
罗斯  别再念了  她又不是讨厌你012---Ross, get over it! It's not like she hates you.
但是  她讨厌陶瓷货仓嘛012---Yeah, but Pottery Barn?
我觉得  她根本就是怪胎012---You know what I think? It's just she-she's weird.
因为她是双胞胎  双胞胎都很怪012---Y’know it’s because she's a twin. Twins are weird.
罗斯  她不是怪胎  她只是希望她的东西独一无二012---Ross, she's not weird. She just wants her stuff to be one-of-a-kind.
什么才是最不独一无二的  双胞胎012---Huh. You know what's not one-of-a-kind? A twin!
菲比来了  把灯关掉  看电影吧012---Ooh, Phoebe's here! Okay, let's turn out the lights and watch the movie.
好漂亮的床单  喜欢是吧012---Okay. Hey, ooh, cool sheet! You like it?
想知道哪里买的吗  好啊012---You want to know where I got it? Sure.
在跳蚤市场买的012---At a flea market.
你去跳蚤市场买床单012---You buy your sheets at a flea market?
罗斯  别这么小气吧012---Ross come on, you gotta loosen the purse strings a little.
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
晚餐再过20分钟就好了  好兴奋喔012---The dinner will be ready in 20 minutes. This is so exciting.
这是你今晚要带过来的酒012---And here is the bottle of wine for you to bring over tonight.
你想送花给摩妮卡012---You were also gonna buy Monica flowers...
却买不起  因为你付了昨晚晚餐的钱012---...but you couldn't afford it,because you paid for dinner last night.
谢谢  但今晚只有我要过去012---Thanks. But, uh, it's just gonna be me tonight.
吉宁怎么了  她病得很重012---What happened to Janine? She's, uh, really sick.
真糟糕  对啊  她整天都在房里012---That's too bad. Yeah, she's been in there all day.
发高烧  鼻塞012---Uh, high fever, nose problem. It's...
痰痰痰痰痰012---Phlegm, phlegm, phlegm, phlegm, phlegm.
摩妮卡   钱德012---Monica! Chandler!
今晚真抱歉  乔伊说了吗012---I'm really-really sorry about tonight. I don't know if Joey told you...
有出戏我一定得去看  抱歉012---...I just couldn't get out of going to this play. I'm sorry.
玩得开心点  好012---Have a great time, huh?
怪了  没有痰啊012---That's funny, I saw no phlegm.
不  她真的病得很重012---Oh, no, she really is sick.
那她为什么要去看戏012---Then why is she going to a play?
你知道的  感冒想退烧012---Uh, well, you know, "Starve a fever...
就要去看戏012---...go to a play for a cold."
乔伊   吉宁为什么不来吃饭012---Joey! Why is Janine not coming over for dinner?
她不想连续两晚都陪你们012---Uh, she didn't want to hang out with you guys two nights in a row.
对不起012---I'm so sorry.
她为什么不想陪我们012---Why doesn't she want to hang out with us?
因为她觉得  你很哈啦012---Because she, uh, she-she thinks that you are "blah."
而摩妮卡  你的嗓门太大012---And that, uh, you, Monica, are too loud.
什么012---What?!
什么012---What?
所以她昨晚只是假装开心012---So she was just pretending to have a good time last night? 
她当面骗我们012---She was lying to our faces?
太扯了012---I can't believe this.
她凭什么批评我们012---Who is she to judge us?
我们对她多好  我才不是哈啦  我是谈笑风生012---We couldn't have been nicer to her. And I am not "blah." I am a hoot!
我知道  我知道012---I know, I know.
拜托啦  别生气012---Come on, please, you guys. Don't be mad.
她一定是012---I'm sure she just, she just said that stuff ...
紧张才会这么说  你们是我最好的朋友012---because she was nervous and you guys are like my best friends!
我们又是第一次约会012---Y’know? And it was our first date.
而且  她病得很重012---Plus, she's really sick.
你明明说那是假的012---No, you sh—No you said you made that up!!
但你不觉得"生病"比"看戏"好吗012---I know, but don't you think the "sick" thing is way better than the "play" thing?
都很好  我通常都说  摩妮卡又醉了012---Eh, they're both good. I generally just go with, "Monica's drunk again."
拜托啦  再给她一次机会012---Come on you guys, please just give her another chance.
她一定会喜欢你们的  我保证  当然好012---She'll come around, I promise. Of course we will.
回去煮饭吧  好012---Come on, we gotta make dinner. Okay.
我不喜欢那个女人012---I do not like that woman!
我听得见012---I can hear you!
我的嗓门真的很大012---I am loud!
真好笑012---Isn't it good?
菲比  别把脚翘在我的新012---Hey Pheebs, could you please not put your feet up on my new...
旧床单上012---...old sheet.
好012---Oh, sure.
我的药师桌012---My apothecary table!
什么  不012---What? No!
这张桌子是哪里买的  陶瓷货仓  好吗012---Ross, where did you get this? I got it at Pottery Barn!! Okay?!
天哪  菲比012---Oh, my God! Phoebe,
陶瓷货仓抄袭我们古董的设计012---Pottery Barn has ripped off the design of our antique!
天哪  要是他们会抄袭012---Wow! Oh my God, well if they've ripped off our table...
那张桌子一定不止值51元012---...ours must be worth much more than one and fifty dollars.
这张连鸦片的味道都没有012---Well this doesn’t even smell like opium.
当然没有  只有你洒出来的酒味012---Of course not, it smells like wine, which you spilled! 
谢谢你还毁了我的床单012---And thanks for wrecking my sheet by the way.
别激动  罗斯  我赔你80分就是了012---Ross, calm down. I'll give you the 80 cents.
再来一次012---Okay, one more time.
钱德  你还要柳橙汁吗012---Chandler, would you like some more orange juice?
音量刚刚好  就是啊012---Perfect decibel. I know!
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
你们在干什么012---Uh, what are you guys doing?
没什么  就是聊天哈啦012---Nothing. We're just talking. You know, blah-blah-blah.
别这样  你们说过要尽力的012---Look, come on you guys, you said you were gonna try!
我来找你们和吉宁一起去看电影012---I came over here to invite you guys to a movie with me and Janine.
你们觉得呢  非常乐意012---What do you say? I'd like to...
但是  我不确定有时间012---...but I'm not sure if we have the time.
真好笑  我也很无奈012---Ha, very funny. I don't know what to do.
我真的很希望你们处得来012---I really want you guys to get along.
拜托  你们跟我们去吧  这是你们欠我的012---Just please, come to the movie with us. I mean you owe me!
我们欠你  没错012---We owe you? That's right.
你们刚交往时  我帮了很多忙012---I helped you guys out a lot in the start of your relationship.
我还帮你们偷鸡摸狗6个月012---I helped you guys sneak around for like six months.
跟白痴一样012---I looked like an idiot.
还被羞辱012---And I was humiliated.
却只赚了2百012---And I only made $200.
我们没有给你钱012---We didn't give you any money.
你以为我不知道吗012---You don't think I know that?
我不知道该拿它配藤条餐桌椅012---see I can't decide whether it would go better next to the new wicker dining chair..
黄色书桌012---...the Sahara desk...
还是螺形托脚桌012---...or the Parker console table.
原来你们这里也有陶瓷货仓012---Wow! I didn't know that there was a Pottery Barn up here.
我知道  我有点买疯了  有点012---I know, I know. I went a little crazy. A little?
这里就像目录第72页012---Your place looks like page 72 of the catalog.
看012---Look at that!
装饰  鸟笼  大号的012---The ornamental birdcage! Large. Ha, ha.
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
罗斯  小心  那个很老了012---Oh, Ross? Be careful. That is very old.
殖民地时代早期的  鸟商  都用那个带 鸟上市场012---Okay? Early Colonial bird merchants used to bring their birds to market in that.
有意思012---Fascinating.
又一个惊人的发现012---Another amazing find! Wow.
它一定也有很棒的典故  没错012---Oh I bet this has a great story too. It does.
这是殖民地时期  分隔房间的装置012---It is a room-separating apparatus from Colonial times.
有好多东西都来自殖民地时期012---Huh, a lot of this stuff is from the Colonial times.
还有哪些时期呢   瑞秋012---What are some other time periods, Rachel?
有往昔012---Well, there's yore.
还有昨年012---Ahem, and, uh, you know, yesteryear.
瑞秋对这种东西真的很有眼光012---Yeah no, I'm telling you Rachel has such a good eye for this stuff.
罗斯  如果你家要重新布置012---Ross, y'know if you ever decide to redecorate--
我觉得很有必要重新布置012---and I think you should--
你应该找瑞秋帮忙012---you should ask Rachel to help.
他才不需要我的帮忙012---Oh honey, he doesn't need my help.
拜托  他早该扔掉那些  你是怎么说的012---Oh, come on! I think he's ready to get rid of the. What'd you call it?
廉价的赝品和恐龙垃圾012---The, uh, "cheap knockoffs and dinosaurjunk"?
是吗012---Really?
你知道吗  既然你这么清楚我的需求012---You know, since you have such a great sense of what I need--
我这里有60元012---Uh, here's 60 bucks.
你带着菲比去殖民时期跳蚤市场012---Why don't you take Phoebe down to that Colonial, uh, flea market...
帮我办货吧012---...and get me some stuff?
我觉得菲比不会想去012---Y'know what? I don't, I don't think Phoebe wants to come.
不  我想去  她想去012---No! I do want to! She does want to.
她想去  没错012---She does want to. Yeah!
菲比  我不知道该说什么  上次跳蚤市场还比较逛得012---Pheebs, I don't know what to say.I guess the flea market was just better last time.
至少我帮罗斯买了床单  没错012---Well, at least I got these sheets for Ross. Yeah.
看  是陶瓷货仓012---Ugh, look at this. Pottery Barn.
你不懂  别看了012---Ugh, yeah, you know what? Don't look at it.
真的  别看了  你看012---Seriously, don't look at it. No! Look-look!
他们抄袭我们的咖啡桌012--- There's the coffee table they stole from us.
那些混蛋  我们走012---Oh, those bastards! Let's go.
那台电风扇跟我们的有点像  还有那个乌笼和012---That fan kind of looks like ours, and the birdcage, and...
等一下  这简直就像是我们的客厅012---Wait a second, this is our exact living room!
不  才不像呢012--- No! No it’s not! 
菲比  我们的完全不一样012---No it’s not! Come on, Phoebe, ours is totally different.
我们没有   我们没有那盏灯012---I mean, we don't have the - We don't have the…that lamp! .
还有那扇屏风  是在另一边012---And-and that screen is y'know, on the other side.
天哪  那些都是陶瓷货仓的东西012---Oh, my God. This is where you got all our stuff.
陶瓷货仓  我的天哪  不是012---Pottery Barn! Oh, my God! No. no.
好啦  你说对了  对不起012---Okay-okay look—no I did,, all right? I'm sorry.
我想要这些东西  又知道你讨厌陶瓷货仓012---I just wanted this stuff and I know how you feel about Pottery Barn.Just...
你不要生气  但是我气死了  气死了012---Come on don't be mad. No-no-no, but I am mad!I am mad!
这代表世间所有丑恶的东西012---Because this stuff is everything that is wrong with the world...
都在我的客厅里012---And it’s all sitting up in my living room...
而我却只想着我没有那盏灯012---...and all I can think about is how I don't have that lamp!
那就买下那盏灯012---Well, then, honey, buy the lamp.
我们有罗斯给的60元012---We have that 60 bucks from Ross.
不行  不行012---I can't! I can't!
除非012---Unless...
你是说我不买那盏灯   你就要搬走吗012---Well are you saying that-that you would move out if-if I didn't buy that lamp?
不  我不会搬走012---No, I'm not gonna move out!
你是说我不买那盏灯  你就要搬走吗012---But are you saying that you would move out if I didn't buy that lamp?
没错  我一定会搬走  那我就没办法了012---Oh. Yes! I would so move out. Okay then I don't have a choice!
那我就得买那盏灯  没错012---I have to buy that lamp! That's right.
不过至少那张药师桌是真货012---But at least the apothecary table is real.
真好  大家都很尽兴吧012---Well, this-this-this was great. Didn't everybody have a great time?
我很尽兴  真的  我想说012---I did. I really did. And you guys, I've got to say...
很抱歉上次聚会后  我态度怪怪的012---I'm sorry if I was a little weird after the last time we went out.
可能是紧张吧012---I guess I was just nervous or something.
我们完全可以理解  别放在心上012---That’s totally understandable. Don't worry about it.
那么我们可以再一起出去了012---So we can go out again?
当然可以  当然012---Oh yeah! Absolutely.
那就晚安  晚安012---Okay, well, good night. Good night.
看吧012---See,huh?
很好玩吧012---Wasn't that fun?
我们非搬家不可012---We have got to move.
什么012---What?
我就知道012---I knew it!
你的嗓门也不小  死丫头012---Y'know, you're not so quiet yourself, missy!
我哈啦  比看现代舞更无聊的012---And I'm blah? Listen, The only thing more boring than watching modern dance...
就是听你聊现代舞012---...is having to listen to you talk about it.
"钱德012---"Oh, Chandler...
我刚才看得浑然忘我"012---...I just lost myself in the movement."
我知道你在说话012---You know, I know you're talking...
但我只听到  叽哩呱啦叽哩呱啦012---...but all I hear is blah-blah-blah-blah-blah.
好  你和我  现在出去  单挑012---All right, you and me! Let's go, right now!
好了  好了  够了  够了012---All right! All right! Enough! Enough! 
够了  你们回去吧  我要跟吉宁谈一谈012---Enough! Enough! You two, go home. I gotta talk to Janine.
你绝对可以撂倒她012---Y'know I think you can take her.
别让我在走廊上碰到你012---You'd better hope I don't see you in the hallway!
好了012---All right. Uh...
我们有个小小的问题012---we've got a little bit of a problem here.
他们是我的朋友  你不能对他们无礼012---These people are my friends; you can't treat them that way.
他们也对我出言不逊   我知道  我会找他们谈012---They said stuff to me too. I know, I know! I'll talk to them about it.
他们对我很重要012---They mean so much to me.
就像我的家人012---They're like my family, you know?
如果你们一见面就吵012---If you guys are gonna be fighting all the time...
我们就不可能在一起  这是行不通的012---I don't think we can be together.It just, it just can't work,okay?
行不通的012---It can't.
我很不开心012---I'm very upset.
好  好吧012---0Kay. Okay.
要是我过去道歉呢012---Would, would it help if I went over and apologized?
好啊012---Yeah! Yeah!
那就太好了012---That would be very helpful! Yeah.
我说过在走廊上碰到会怎样012---What did I tell you about the hall?
我只是要过去向你们道歉012---I was just coming over here to apologize for my behavior!
我很希望能跟你们做朋友012---I'd really like it if we could be friends.
我知道那样会让乔伊很高兴  所以012---Well, I know that would make Joey happy, so...
我也愿意012---...I would like that too.
太好了  来吧012---Great. Now, come on.
很高兴能达成共识  我也是012---Well, I'm glad we worked it out. Me too.
回头见  再见012---Okay. I'll see you. Bye.
听都听得见  够了012---Or I'll hear you. That's it, big girl.
慢着012---Wait!
你最好快逃012---You'd better run!
你听见了吗  听见了012---Did you hear that? Yeah uh,
我该怎么办  难为你了012---What am I gonna do? Yeah, I'm sorry man.
要去看吗  当然012---Want to go watch? Yeah!
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
大家好  她搬出去了吗012---How you doing? So, uh, did she move out?
差不多了012---Pretty much, yeah.
你居然就这样跟她分手了012---I cannot believe you broke up with her just like that.
不适合就是不适合012---Well, When it's not right, you know it.
你还好吧  死不了012---You okay? Yeah! Yeah. I'll be all right.
我有办法让你开心  什么办法012---You know what'd cheer you up? What?
我明晚要教侵蚀理论012---I'm giving this lecture on erosion theories tomorrow night.
你应该来听听012---I think you should come.
你说的对  我确实开心多了012---You're right, that did cheer me up.
快看  你们一定不信012---Hey. You're not going to believe this.
我编了一则笑话寄到《花花公子》012---I made up a joke and sent it in to Playboy.
结果登出来了012---They printed it. Yeah.
我不知道《花花公子》也登笑话012--- I didn't know Playboy prints jokes.
他们有笑话   专访   扎实新闻报导012---Yeah, they print jokes, interviews, hard-hitting journalism.

也许可以啊012---Maybe I could be a waiter.
我可以用电话吗012---Could I use the phone?
她选瑞秋012---She picked Rachel.
她想改口  但是很明显   她选瑞秋012---I mean, she tried to back out of it, but it was obvious. She picked Rachel.
他偷了我的笑话  就这么偷走了012---He took my joke. He just took it.

选择瑞秋   没错012---Picking Rachel. That's right.
什么声音012---Did you hear something?
也许是罗斯爬进我的脑袋   窃取我的思维012---Maybe it's the sound of Ross climbing into my brain and stealing my thoughts.
是客厅传来的012---It's coming from the living room.
我的书看完了012---I finished my book.

记得吗  就是你选瑞秋  不选我那次012---Remember? When you picked Rachel over me?
多好玩啊012---That was funny. Ha, ha, ha.
是蛮好玩的   一点也不好玩012---It was kind of funny. It wasn't funny at all!
你为什么选她012---Why would you do that?
为什么不选我012---Why didn't you pick me?
好012---Fine.
我之所以稍微倾向瑞秋012---The reason I was leaning a little bit more toward Rachel than you...
是因为你012---...is just, you know, you're...
有点难搞   我们去吃饭吧012---...high maintenance. Let's go to lunch.
哪有这回事啊012---That is completely untrue.

不   你说的对  你很好相处012---No, you're right, you're easygoing.
只是没有瑞秋那么好相处  她比较012---You're just not as easygoing as Rachel. you know, She's just more...
有弹性  比较圆融   就这样012---...flexible and mellow. That's all.
每个人都不一样012---Well, people are different.
瑞秋什么都好  怎么欺负她都行012---Ya, you know, Rachel...she'll do whatever you want. Y'know, you can just walk all over her.

你听着  我们不跟你去吃饭了012---you know what? You're not invited to lunch!
怎么样   够强硬了吧012---What do you think of that? I think that's pretty strong.
我就是这么想的  快点  摩妮卡  我们去吃饭012---that's what I think. Come on, Monica, let's go to lunch.
清单给我列出来012---You start working on that list.

别跟我使眼色012---Don't wink at me.
把围裙穿上012---And put on your apron.
穿就穿012---Okay. Heh, heh.
你怎么不叫其他客人穿围裙012---but I don’t see you asking other paying customers to put on aprons.
乔伊  你在这里打工吗  没有012---Joey, do you work here? No.
服务生  什么事012---Waiter. Yeah!
乔伊  怎么回事  为什么不告诉我们你在这里打工012---Joey, what's going on'? Why didn't you tell us you work here?
嗯012---Uh...
这件事其实挺尴尬的  我之前是演员  现在是服务生012---It's kind of embarrassing. I mean, I was an actor, now I'm a waiter.
一般应该反过来才对啊012---It's supposed to go in the other direction.

或许  我是有点难搞012---So, maybe I am a little high maintenance.
或许  瑞秋是有一点没个性012---And maybe Rachel is a little bit of a pushover.

很抱歉这么说   但是你   菲比  是个怪人012---Yes, we are very sorry to tell you this, but you, Phoebe, are flaky.

史提夫说他要去看医生   他的医生姓侯奇012---Steve said he had to go to the doctor. And his doctor's name is Dr. Mompey.
我就说  "猴子医生"   所以才会有猴子医生这个笑话012---I said, "Dr. Monkey?" And that is how the whole Dr. Monkey thing came up.
你开什么玩笑012---Are you kidding?
我是学进化论的012---Okay, look, I study evolution.

还有医生   还有猴子012---And doctors. And monkeys.
你们不该争笑话是谁的012---You shouldn't argue over who gets credit.
应该争的是  谁让这世界受这种罪012---You should be arguing over who gets blamed for inflicting this horrible joke upon the world.

那个笑话烂透了012---The joke sucks.

嘿  是菲比和瑞秋012---Hey, it's Phoebe and Rachel.
你要不要告诉她们012---Why don't you tell them...
你刚才说我并不难搞012---...what you were telling me earlier about me not being high maintenance.
摩妮卡是个自信沉着的女性012---Monica is a self-sufficient, together lady.
跟她在一起就像是在度假012---Being with her has been like being on a vacation.
至于所谓的难搞嘛012---And what may be perceived as high maintenance...
只是注重小细节012---...is merely attention to detail...
和012---...and...
心灵的慷慨012---...generosity of spirit.
哇  这真是我所听过的  最棒的假话012---Wow. You know what? That is the best fake speech I think I've ever heard.
真的  我还听过更棒的012---Really? I've heard better.
等等   那是他自己说的  你告诉她们  钱德012---Wait, he came up with that himself. Tell them, Chandler.
我已经词穷了  可不可以重复012---I'm out of words. Should I just say the whole thing again?
我一点也不难搞012---Look, I am not high maintenance!
一点也不难搞   钱德012---I am not. Chandler!
你只有一点点难搞012---You're a little high maintenance.
你上我的黑名单了012---You are on my list!
对不起  你并不012---Look, I'm sorry, but you're not--
你并不好相处  但你很热情012---You're not easygoing, but you're passionate.
这样就很好012---And that's good.
当你为小事不高兴时   我觉得我特别能012---And when you get upset about little things, I think I'm pretty good...
安抚你的012---...at making you feel better about that.
那样也很好  所以她们说你难搞012---That's good too. They say you're high maintenance...
也没错   因为我喜欢012---...but it's okay, because I like...
搞定你012---...maintaining you.
我没叫他说这些012---I didn't even tell him to say that.
好吧012---Aw. Okay.
你从黑名单除名了  我被除名了012---All right, you're off my list. I'm off the list.
菲比012---Phoebe?
你不找我当女朋友也没关系012---It's okay that you don't want me to be your girlfriend.
因为我有最棒的男朋友012---Because I have the best boyfriend.
我突然觉得你好迷人012---You know, suddenly I find you very attractive.
兄弟  试镜结果如何012---Hey, buddy boy, How'd the audition go?
不  不太好012---Oh, not good. No.
我没拿到那个角色  这里的工作也没了  所以012---I didn't get the part. And I lost my job here, so...
好惨烈的试镜012---Wow, that is a bad audition.
这里的工作为什么没了012---Well, how did you lose your job here?
我要去试镜012---Well, I had the audition...
但阿甘叫我看店  他好去染头发012---...but Gunther said I had to stay here and be in charge so he could get his hair dyed.
但我还是去了  他就炒我鱿鱼012---So I went anyway, and he fired me.
他扔下工作去办私事012---He left work in the middle of the day to do a personal errand...
叫才来两天的你看店012---...and left you in charge when you've been here two days?
这样不对吧012---That's not right.
但是能怎么办012---What are you gonna do?
乔伊  你不能就这么算了012---Joey, you can't let him get away with that.
我绝不放过他   我要去教训他012---Ya know what, I won't let him get away with that. I'm gonna say something to him--
不  我不该多事  不  我要去教训他012---No, I really shouldn't say anything. No, I should say something to him!
阿甘  让乔伊继续在这里打工012---Gunther? I want you to give Joey his job back.
你这样解雇他  很不好012---That is really not fair that you have to fire him-Okay.
什么  他可以继续工作012---What? He can have his job back.
没错  他可以继续工作012---That's right, he can have his job back.
说开了就好了012---Glad we got that all straightened out.
好了  乔伊012---There you go, Joey.
你可以继续工作了  太好了  谢谢你  瑞秋012---Got your job back. That's great. Thanks, Rach.
不赖吧  谁没个性了012---Pretty nice, huh? Now who's a pushover?
瑞秋  你坐到我的位子了  抱歉012---Rach, you're in my seat. I'm sorry.
你们都没说会找谁当女朋友012---Hey, I never got to hear who you'd pick to be your girlfriend.
我选你  菲比  没错   绝对是你012---I'd pick you, Phoebe. Yeah, definitely you, Pheebs.
我也这么觉得012---Yeah, I kind of thought.
没错  绝对是你012---Never. It would totally be you.
嘿012---Hey.
我有个问题   如果你们要找其中一个人当男朋友012---Hey. Oh, I have a question. If-if-if one of you had to pick one of the other two to go out with...
你们会找谁012---...who would you pick?
少来  我拒绝回答012---No way. I'm not answering.
乔伊012---Joey.
少来  我拒绝回答012---No way, I'm not answering that.
瑞秋  松饼加浓缩咖啡4块5012---Okay, Rash, that's muffin and espresso, 4.50.
罗斯  双份拿铁2块75  钱德  咖啡和司康4块25012---Ross, double latte, 2.75. Chandler, coffee and a scone, 4.25.
菲比  花茶1块25012---And, Pheebs, herbal tea, 1.25.
总共是  12块75012---So all together that's 12.75.
他以前都不知道80块电话帐单的一半是多少呢012---This coming from the man who couldn't split our $80 phone bill in half.
嗨  嗨012---Hi. Hi.
我的松饼和拿铁多少钱012---How much do I owe you for the muffin and the latte?
你的由乔伊崔比亚尼免费招持012---Oh, that's on the house, courtesy of Joey Tribbiani.
真好  帮我谢谢他012---Oh. Great. Well, tell him thanks.
既然乔伊人这么好  也许我们可以约个会012---And since Joey seems like such a nice guy, maybe we could go on a date sometime?
他不太习惯女人这么主动012---Well, he's not used to women being so forward with him...
不过我问过他了  他说同意了012---...but uh, I good check with him—He says it's okay.
太好了  谢谢  再见012---Great. Thanks. Bye-bye.
乔伊  为什么我们的不是免费012---Hey, Joey, how come our stuff isn't free?
等你穿窄裙也那么辣就有了012---It will be when you look like that in a tight skirt.
真好  我的约会次数又要破纪录了012---This is great. I'm getting more dates than ever.
慢着  你只为美女免费012---Wait, you're only giving away free stuff to the pretty girls?
对啊  乔伊  好恶心啊012---Yeah，Joey, that is so gross.
要不要来一块免费司康012---Hmm. How about a scone on the house, baby?
我是美女012---I'm pretty.
老友记  第六季  第13集  瑞秋的妹妹012---Friends  S06E13  The One With Rachel's Sister
有人有口香糖吗   我有012---Hey, does anyone have any gum? Oh, I do.
对不起  拿一下012---Here. Sorry.
好像是012---Oh, you know what?
不是012---No.
等一下012---Wait a second.
我记得我有   算了  不用了012---I know it's in here somewhere. You know what? I'm good. I'm good.
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
你怎么回来了  不是在上班吗012---What are you doing here? Shouldn't you be at work?
他们叫我回家  说什么感冒不能做菜012---They sent me home. They said I can't work if I'm sick.
这样012---Aw.
真可怜  我没有感冒012---I'm so sorry that you're sick. I'm not sick.
我才不会感冒012---I don't get sick.
软弱和娘娘腔的人才会感冒012---Getting sick is for weaklings. It's for pansies.
没有人觉得你娘娘腔012---Honey, no one thinks that you're a pansy.
但我们觉得你需要面纸012---But we do think that you need a tissue.
我已经3年多没感冒了012---I have not been sick in over three years.
我帮你拿几张面纸  我不需要面纸  我很好...哪012---I'm gonna grab you some tissue. I don't need a tissue. I'm fine.
好的后面还加个哪   就不好哪012---When you put a D at the end of "fine," you're not fine.
我很好…哪012---I'm fine.
我很好…哪012---I'm fine.
这句话很难说012---You know, it's a really hard word to say.
哪位  瑞秋在吗  我是她的妹妹012---Yes? Hi. ls Rachel here? I'm her sister.
天哪  吉儿  天哪  瑞秋012---Oh, my God, Jill. Oh, my God, Rachel.
天哪  介绍一下吧012---Oh, my God, introduce us.
这位是钱德  你好012---This is Chandler. Hi.
你认识摩妮卡和罗斯012---And you know Monica and Ross.
嗨  那是菲比  那是乔伊012---Hi. And that's Phoebe, and that's Joey.
你好吗  不准012---Hey. How you doing? Don't.
你怎么来了012---Honey, what are you doing here? Oh.
这是哪个妹妹012---Which sister is this?
被宠坏的还是咬她的那一位012---Is this the spoiled one or the one that bit her?
老爸断了我的财源  我知道了012---Daddy cut me off. Never mind, I got it.
你知道我怎么说012---And you know what I said to him?
我说 "我要请一个律师  把你的钱都告过来012---I said, "I'm gonna hire a lawyer, and I'm gonna sue  you and take all your money...
然后断了你的财源"012---...and then I'm gonna cut you off."
那他怎么说  他说不帮我付律师费012---What did he say? He said he wouldn't pay for my lawyer.
还叫我来跟他唯一自豪的女儿012---Then he told me to come  here and learn about the value of money...
学学金钱的价值012---...from the one daughter he's actually proud off.
你们听到了吗   我爸以我为荣   我爸以我为荣012---Did you hear that? My dad's proud of me. My dad's proud of me. Ha, ha.
瑞秋  好  抱歉012---Rash'? Oh, yeah, sorry.
爸为什么不给你钱012---Hey, honey, so, what did you do that made Dad cut you off?
我买了一艘船   你买了一艘船012---Okay, I bought a boat. You bought a boat?
不是我要的  是要送一个朋友的012---Yeah, but it wasn't for me, it was for a friend.
男生们  我们跟这个可怜的妹妹交个朋友吧012---Boy, did we make friends with the wrong sister.
吉儿  我觉得对你  这是一次最好的教训012---Jill, honey, I think this is the best thing that could've ever happened to you.
反正你也得独立012---You've needed to get out on your own anyway.
我刚开始独立时  也很害怕012---And you know, when I did it, at first I was scared...
结果现在呢012---...but then look at me now.
我是唯一让老爸骄傲的女儿012---I am the only daughter that Dad is proud of.
你现在要做的是找一份工作012---Okay, well, this is what you're gonna do. You're gonna get a job.
找一间公寓  我会帮你012---You're gonna get an apartment. And I'll help you.
你可以跟我们住  对吧  菲比  可以吧012---You can stay with us. Right? Phoebe，She can stay with us?
当然可以  太好了012---Of course, yeah. Oh, that's so great.
好吧  那我就来独立独立  真不知道该怎么感谢你们012---Okay, I'm really gonna do this. I don't know how to thank you guys.
我喜欢汽车012---Aw. I like cars.
你还要用吗  不要了012---You all finished here? Yes.
太好了012---Great.
早上的小费出来了012---Okay, here are the tips for this morning. Mm.
珍50  我50  乔伊欠8块钱012---Jen gets 50, 5O for me, and Joey owes $8.
什么  因为你到处免费送吃的012---What? For all the free food you gave away.
既然是送的  为什么跟我要钱012---Well, if it's free food, how come you're charging me for it'?
我们只免费招待寿星012---We don't give anything away unless it's someone's birthday.
那模特儿比赛第三名呢012---Oh. What if they came in third in a modeling contest?
不行  抱歉012---No. Oh. Sorry.
我今天好惨  这些袋子好重012---I just had the hardest day. Some of these are so heavy.
吉儿  你怎么有钱了  你爸不是把信用卡都收走了吗012---Jill, how did you pay for all this? I thought your dad took your credit card.
拜托   我15岁就会背卡号了012---Oh, please, I memorized those numbers when I was 15.
你们看我买的这些 "独立"行头012---But look at all the cool make-it-on-my-own stuff I got.
这是 "请雇用我" 毛衣012---This is my "Please hire me" sweater.
这是  "你不想把房子租我吗" 裤子012---And these are my "Don't you want to rent me this apartment?" pants.
叫你爸付你的置装费不算独立012---I don't think charging clothes to your dad qualifies as making it on your own.
大科学家就是这么死板012---Oh, Mr. Scientist has to get all technical.
瑞秋真的也不会赞成的012---I don't think Rachel's gonna think it's a good idea.
谁封她当女王了  我超想当女王的012---So who made her queen of the world? I would love that job.
怎么样啊  嘿012---Hey. What's going on? Hey.
吉儿012---Jill.
你跑去逛街吗012---Did you shop?
没有012---No.
是他们012---They did.
对  我们跑去逛街  对  我们跑去逛街012---Yeah, we went shopping. Yeah, we went shopping. Yeah.
你们跑去逛街012---You went shopping?
然后大包小包提回来  在吉儿面前炫耀012---Then you came in here and paraded it right under Jill's nose...
你们明知她想过节俭的生活012---...when you know she's trying to quit.
你们两个家伙  真差劲012---Wow. You guys, that's terrible.
抱歉  吉儿  对不起  吉儿012---Sorry, Jill. Sorry, Jill.
没关系012---It's okay.
你们买了什么  我买了  谢谢012---So, what did you get? Oh, well, all right. I got-Thank you.
我买了这件   "我要工作"毛衣012---I got, um, this, you know, "I want a job" sweater.
哇哦012---Oh.
还买了这条公寓裤012---And then I got, uh... These are apartment pants.
公寓裤012---Apartment pants?
对  你没听说过吗012---Yeah, you've never heard of them?
当然听过012---No, of course. Of course I've heard of them.
罗斯  那你呢012---Ross, what did you get? Huh?
我买了这个012---I got this...
这个012---This.
喀什米尔  对012---A pashmina? Yeah.
我爱死它了012---Oh, I love these babies.
是吗012---Really? Mm-hm.
罗斯  喀什米尔是什么012---Ross, what's a pashmina?
一种小毯子012---It's a rug.
吉儿012---Jill?
瑞秋  对不起012---I'm sorry, Rachel.
拜托  你真以为我会上当012---Oh, come on, you really think that's gonna work on me?
泪眼攻势是我发明的012---I invented that.
也对  但我真的很抱歉012---Oh, right. But I am sorry.
算了   走一次回头路还算好012---All right, it's okay. One little setback is okay.
就是别再犯了  好吗  好012---But don't let it happen again, all right? Okay.
既然这是老爸付的钱  我应该全都没收012---Now, since Daddy paid for all this stuff, I should take it all away.
不过我没收披肩就好012---But I'm just gonna take the pashmina.
还有那条裤子012---And the pants.
还是统统没收好了  这样你才能得到教训012---You know what? I'm just gonna take it all, because that way, you'll learn the lesson.
好了012---All right
我有事要忙  晚餐见012---I'm gonna run a couple of errands, and I will see you at dinner.
都被她拿走了012---She took all my stuff.
没错   除了这个蓝色小袋子012---Yeah. Everything but the little blue one.
这一样最棒了012---That's the best one.
天哪  太谢谢你  这个嘛012---Oh, my God. Thank you so much. Oh. Well, hey.
天哪  你好差劲   喀什米尔怎么会是小毯子012---Oh, my gosh, that was so lame. Like a pashmina could be a rug.
那你呢012---Oh, yeah? Well, how about you with the:
"对不起"  闭嘴  我哪有那么恶心012---"I'm sorry." Shut up. I wasn't like that at all.
我那个公寓裤呢012---What about what I said, you know, about the apartment pants?
够蠢吧012---How dumb was I?
你高中时有这么可爱吗   别闹了012---Were you this cute in high school? Oh, stop.
你才别闹了   你才别闹了012---No, you stop. No, you stop.
你别闹了012---You stop.
好   我坐中间   你们都别闹了012---Okay-okay, why don't I sit here and then you'll both stop it?
你想做什么  我们来疯一下012---Okay, so, what do you wanna do? Let's do something crazy.
我知道  我们来  多休息多喝水012---I know, let's rest and drink lots of fluids.
好  我休息012---Okay, I'll rest.
不过如果我要上床  你也得跟我来012---But, you know, if I'm going to bed, then you're coming with me.
我本来很难说不  但是你鼻水流不停012---See, that would be impossible to resist if you weren't all drippy here.
你是说你不想要我吗012---Are you saying that you don't wanna get with this?
你最好连健康时都不要像这样012---Yeah, I don't think you should say that even when you're healthy.
来嘛012---Oh. Come on.
我不是针对你012---Don't take this personally, okay?
我就是没办法跟病人上床012---It's just that I just can't have sex with a sick person.
我也是  钱德012---I'm with you, Chandler.
我也不跟病人上床   那样好恶心012---I can't have sex with a sick person either. That's disgusting.
但是我没病   我可以证明给你看012---But I'm not sick. Let me prove it to you.
我们身强体壮  青春正盛012---We are two healthy people in the pribe of libe.
我就是想  继续012---See, that's the thing. I would like to stay in...
身强体壮012---...the prime of mwha-ah-libe.
嘿012---Hey.
嘿  怎么样啊012---Hey. What's up?
有件事或许你应该知道012---Um, I think there's something you should maybe know.
最好不是公寓裤的事012---Well, it’d better not be about the apartment pants...
因为我的上司爱死这个构想了012---...because I just pitched the idea to my boss at Ralph Lauren, and she loved it.
不  不是  我刚刚012---No, no. It's just, I was, um...
你走了后  我跟罗斯和吉儿在一起012---I was with Ross and Jill after you left...
我相当确定  他们之间有火花012---...and I'm pretty sure I saw a little spark between them.
什么  或许没事012---What? Yeah, I mean, it's probably nothing.
我只是想提醒你  他们或许有什么012---But I just wanted to warn you that there might be something there.
罗斯跟吉儿  对012---With Ross and Jill? Yeah.
罗斯和我妹妹012---With Ross and my sister?
嗯012---Yeah.
我妹吉儿和我的前男友罗斯012---With my sister Jill and my ex-boyfriend Ross?
嗯012---Yeah.
不可能的  那好吧012---Oh, there is no way. Okay, then.
我的天哪   我真不敢相信012---Oh, my God. I cannot believe that.
我不是反对罗斯交女朋友  可居然跟我妹012---I don't really like it when Ross goes out with anyone, but my sister?
这不是等于乱伦吗012---Isn't that like incest or something?
天哪  而且他们会上床  要是他还娶她呢012---Oh, my God, and they're gonna have sex. Oh, no. What if he marries her too?
太恐怖了  真是太恐怖了012---Oh, this is just terrible. This is just terrible.
而我又不能阻止  罗斯又不是我的012---And I can't stop it. I don't own Ross, you know?
而且吉儿有她的行动自由012---And Jill, she should be able to do whatever it is she wants to do.
我的天哪  罗斯居然要娶我妹012---Oh, my God, I can't believe Ross is marrying my little sister.
这简直012---This is just--
天那  这真是我这一生最悲惨的遭遇012---Oh, my God, this is just the worst thing that could've ever happened to me.
不过公寓裤的事真是太好了012---But great news about the apartment pants, huh?
总共3块85012---That'll be 3.85.
什么意思   昨天你还说我太美可以免费的012---What do you mean? Yesterday you said I was too pretty to pay for stuff!
现在我不能请客   因为经理说我012---It's just I can't, because my manager said that I--
祝你生日快乐012---Happy birthday to you
生日快乐012---Happy birthday to you
祝安妮生日快乐  艾美012---Happy birthday, dear Annie-Amy.
艾美012---Am.
祝你生日快乐012---Happy birthday to you
嘿  真巧  今天也是我的生日012---Hey. Hey, that's weird, today's my birthday too.
不  在这里不是012---Yeah, not in here it isn't.
抱歉迟到了  什么事012---Sorry I'm late. What's up?
哦   嘿012---On, hey. Uh...
我只是想问你工作找得怎样012---You know, I just wanted to see if there were any leads on the old job front.
没进展  但我经过三家折扣店都没进去012---Oh. No. But I just walked past three sales and I didn't go in.
我很坚强吧  嗯012---How strong am I? Oh.
太好了012---That is great.
你知道谁不必找工作012---Hey, you know who doesn't have to job-hunt?
罗斯  他在大学教书  是啊012---Ross. He works at the university. Yeah?
所以你知道  你们聊过  你们很投缘  你们要约会吗012---Oh so you know that, you guys talked about that, so you get along, so you think you’re gonna go out?
我跟罗斯约会  当然不会  你哪来的念头012---Me go out with Ross? No. God, no. What would make you think that?
就菲比012---I just, Phoebe...
觉得你们有什么012---...said she, you know, thought she saw something between you guys.
没有  他人是很好  是啊012---No. I mean, he's nice. Yeah.
你想和他做朋友  但不想和他交往012---He's the kind of guy you're friends with but not the kind of guy you date.
你会  你跟他交往过  而我呢012---I mean, he's the kind of guy you date, because you did, but me?
就没什么兴趣012---Hmm, not so much.
没什么兴趣   什么意思012---Oh, not so much? What do you mean?
罗斯有哪里不好吗012---I mean, is there something wrong with Ross?
没有  只不过012---Oh, no, no, no. He's just--
我不知道  他有点书呆子吧012---I don't know. You know, he's just a little bookish.
你觉得他是怪胎  你也有同感012---Are you saying he's a geek? You think so too?
不  罗斯不是怪胎012---No. No. Ross is not a geek.
好  就当他不是我喜欢的类型012---Fine. Then let's just say he's not my type.
什么  你不喜欢帅哥012---What, handsome is not your type?
聪明  好心  吻功一流  难道这些不是你的条件012---Smart, kind, good kisser? What, those things aren't on your list?
罗斯人很好  能跟他在一起是你的福气012---Ross is a great guy. You would be lucky to be with him.
好  既然你这么在意  我就约他012---Well, okay, if it means that much to you, I'll ask him out.
不  不  不   我不是那个意思012---Oh, no, no, no. That's not what I meant. I was just--
你知道吗  瑞秋  你说得对  他对我确实很好012---You know what, Rachel? You're right. You know, he has been really nice to me.
但他不是你的菜012---Yeah, but he's not your type.
或许这是个好事012---But maybe that's a good thing.
我正在做各种不同的尝试012---You know, I'm doing all these different things.
或许也应该跟怪胎约会看看012---Maybe I should just try dating a geek too.
但你也别一下子做太多的尝试012---Yeah, but you don't, you know-You don't wanna try too much too fast.
你记不记得   一下子做太多尝试的012---I mean, you do remember what happened to the little girl...
那个小女孩012---...who tried too much too fast, don't you?
什么012---What?
她死了  吉儿012---She died, Jill.
钱德012---Chandler.
什么事  你想喝茶  还是喝汤012---What is it, honey? You need some tea? Some soup?

呼叫大鹏医生  大鹏医生请上床012---Calling Dr. Big. Dr. Big to the bed.
天哪  我以为你睡了012---Oh, jeez, honey, I thought, I thought you were asleep.
知道你在外面  我怎么睡得着啊012---How could I be asleep knowing that you were in the next room?
我倒是睡着了012---I was asleep.
不  不  你知道怎么穿才性感   多穿几层012---Oh, no, no, no, honey. You know what's sexy? Layers.
多穿几层才性感012---Layers are sexy.
被子才性感   热水袋更性感012---And blankets are sexy. And, oh, hot water bottles are sexy.
快点  上床啦   我想证明我没生病012---Come on, get into bed. I wanna prove that I'm not sick.
我想让你跟我一样舒服012---I wanna make you feel as good as I feel.
我拜托你休息下  我没事哪012---Would you please get some rest? I'm fine.
祝你生日快乐012---Happy birthday to you
你出钱  不  今天是她的生日012---You're paying for that. What? No, no, it's her birthday.
你已经对20个不同女人唱 "生日快乐"了012---You've sung "Happy Birthday" to 20 different women today.
但是  你失去了012---But it-You are no longer authorized...
送生日松饼的权限了012---...to distribute birthday muffins.
妈的012---Damn it.
瑞秋012---Rash .
嗨  嗨012---Hi. Hi. Ahem.
你叫你妹约我吗012---Did you tell your sister to ask me out?
对  哇  真是的012---Well, yeah. Oh, wow. I mean, wow.
我觉得她很可爱012---I think she's cute...
但我从来没想过要跟她约会  从来没想012---...but I never would've thought of going out with her. Never.
真的  对啊012---Really? Yeah.
不过既然你都说行  我心想  何不试试012---But after you said it was okay, I figured, why not?
所以  也不算 "从来没想"过012---Oh, so not really "never." Heh.
你真的  比我大方多了012---I have to say, you are a much bigger person than I am.
我们经历过那么多过去  我012---I mean, after all we've been through. I just--
真希望我有兄弟   也可以来交换012---You know what? I wish I had a brother to reciprocate.
嗯012---Aw.
如果你想跟摩妮卡交往  我绝对祝福012---Hey, if you ever wanna go out with Monica, you have my blessing.
我也是012---And mine.

好啦   我承认  我很不舒服012---Okay, fine, I admit it. I feel terrible.
帮我在胸口抹点药膏   好012---Will you please rub this on my chest? Okay.
不  不行  你别想骗我上钩012---No, no, no. You are not getting me this way.
拜托  我真的需要你帮我  不  不行012---Come on, I really need your help here. No, no, no.
好  那我就自己抹  好012---Fine, I'll rub it on myself. Okay.
你在往身上抹药膏012---So you're just kind of rubbing it on yourself?
怎么样  蛮好的012---Yeah. It's nice.
不会吧  这样你也会兴奋012---Are you kidding me? Is this turning you on?
对012---Yes.
真是不敢相信   是抹的动作还是味道012---I can't believe it. Is it the rubbing or the smell?
感觉都很赞啊012---It's all very, very good.
想不想012---So you wanna go, uh...
嘿咻一下012---...mix it up?
现在不行  我病了  少来了  大骗子012---Not now, I'm sick. Oh, come on, you big faker.
你不是不跟病人上床012---What about your rule about never sleeping with sick people?
那是在那个令人酥麻的动作之前012---Well, that was before all the vaporizing action.
好吧  如果你真的想做  好的012---Okay, if you really wanna have sex. Okay.
有够灵的012---Worked like a charm.
嗨  嗨012---Hi. Hi.
你来这里干什么012---What are you doing here?
我跟罗斯约在这里  看看  我的打扮怎么样012---This is where Ross and I are meeting for our date. So, what do you think?
我不喜欢012---I don't like it.
是吗  有点下贱012---Really? It's kind of slutty.
这是你的衣服012---It's yours.
是嘛  那我是个贱人012---Yeah, well, I'm a slut.
我也是012---Me too.
嗨  吉儿  嘿012---Hi, Jill. Hey.
嗨012---Hi...
瑞秋  瑞秋012---Rachel. Rachel.
你不在家   你在这里012---Heh. You're not at home, you're right here.
我知道012---Yeah, I know.
你一定会以为很怪   其实不会012---And I bet you thought it would be weird. But it's not.
对012---0Kay.
那么  我012---So, Well, I'll, um...
我午夜之前会送她回家012---I'll have her home by midnight. Ha, ha.
你为什么还没回家012---Why aren't you home yet?
外面有人吗012---ls someone there?
有  是我  抱歉012---Oh, yeah, it's me. Sorry.
你来干什么012---What are you doing here?
我只是在看窗外的风景012---Uh, I'm just looking out your window at the view.
你们在干什么012---What are you guys doing?
我们身上沾到药膏012---We got some VapoRub in some places.
他把她带回家了012---Oh. He brought her back to his apartment.
谁012---Who?
那是你妹妹吗012---Is that your sister?
她真是个贱人012---Ugh. She is a slut.
天呐  罗斯在跟你妹约会  多奇怪啊012---God. Ross is on a date with your sister. How weird is that?
天哪  看  他在脱她的衣服012---Oh, my God, look, he's taking off her clothes.
他在帮她脱外套012---He's taking off her coat.
真是太糟糕了012---Oh, this is just terrible.
不会啦  才第一次约会   一定不会有012---Oh, no, it's not. It was the first date. I'm sure that nothing is gonna...
他有福了012---Hoo-hoo. He's gonna get some.
能看到屋外012---Of the glare...
街灯的灯光012---...from the Streetlight out of his apartment.
所以  他就把窗帘拉上了012---You know, so, urn, he's closed the drapes there...
好跟你妹好好聊一聊012---...so he can have a nice pleasant conversation with your little sister.
我去睡了012---Well, I'm off to bed.
嘿  瑞秋  我只是过来012---Oh. Uh, hey, Rach. I was just coming over here to, uh...
等等  我没必要向你撒谎  你都搬走了012---Oh, wait, I don't have to lie to you, you don't live here anymore.
我在吃他们的东西  你呢012---I'm eating their food. What are you doing?
罗斯跟我妹约会012---Ross is on a date with my sister.
窗帘已经拉上2个半小时了012---They shut the drapes two and a half hours ago.
我们能跟你妹妹约会吗012---Whoa, I didn't know we could date your sister.
乔伊  我们知道你在偷东西吃012---Joey, we know you steal our food.
不用了012---I'm good.
窗帘还没拉开012---Oh, are the drapes still closed hon?
对  其实隔开两户的变态老夫妇  才应该拉上窗帘的012---Yeah. And y'know who should've shut their drapes is that perverted couple two doors over.
那是秋千吗  不要问012---Is that a swing? Oh, don't even ask.
罗斯居然跟瑞秋的妹妹约会012---I can't believe Ross is going out with Rachel's sister.
钱德跟我妹亲热   我气了他10年012---When Chandler made out with my sister, I was mad at him for 1O years.
那是5年前的事  对  你还剩5年012---That was like five years ago. Yeah, you got five years left.
乔伊  你想再加1年吗012---Joey-You wanna make it six?

罗斯  你好吗  你在这里012---Oh, Ross, hey. Hi, how are you? There you are.
嘿012---Hey.
一杯咖啡012---Can I get a cup of coffee?
昨晚的约会怎样啊012---So how was your big date last night?
还不错  很开心012---Uh, it was okay. Yeah, it was fun.
是吗  对啊012---It was fun? Yeah.
太好了012---Great.
所以  你们合得来吗012---So, uh... So did you guys hit it off?
应该吧  所以  那后来你们又怎么样嘛012---I guess so. So, uh... So did anything happen?
听说你们把窗帘拉上了012---Because rumor has it you guys shut the drapes. Heh.
不  不  我们没怎么样012---No, no, nothing happened.
我是要放映我最爱的化石幻灯片012---I shut the drapes to show her slides of my favorite fossils.
幻灯片啊012---Oh, slides. Ha, ha.
所以你们真的没怎么样012---So really nothing happened.
我们可以有怎么样  对了  她很喜欢我的幻灯片012---Something could've happened, all right? She really dug my slides.
而且她绝对对我有放电012---Mm. And she was definitely giving me the vibe.
是 "别再给我看三叶虫照片" 的电吗012---Was it the "Please don't show me another picture of a trilobite" vibe?
总之012---Anyway...
要是她不喜欢我   为什么要再约我012---If she wasn't into me, why would she ask me out again?
她又约你了  对啊012---She asked you out again? Yeah, uh-huh.
明天晚上012---Tomorrow night. Hmm.
一年之中最浪漫的日子  情人节012---Valentine's Day. The most romantic day of the year.
谁知道会怎样012---Who knows what could happen?
到时候我拉上窗帘   或许就不是要放幻灯片了  你懂吧012---I might not be shutting my drapes to show her my slides, if you know what--
当然   我懂  我懂了012---Okay, okay, okay, I got it, I got it.
我不能接受你跟我妹交往012---I can't-I can't go with the you-and-my-sister thing.
我就是不能  那样太奇怪了  好吗012---I just can't. It's just too weird, all right?
一想到你们在一起  我就抓狂012---I imagine the two of you together, I freak out.
我会疯掉的  我受不了  我受不了  好了  好了  别激动012---It just freaks me out, and I can't do it. Okay, okay, okay. No-Yes. It's okay.
没事的012---It's okay.
如果你受不了  我就不再见她012---Hey, it's too weird for you. I won't see her again.
谢谢你  我是说过了明晚之后012---Thank you. I-Yeah. I mean, after tomorrow night.
不不不  求求你  罗斯  我受不了  我真的会捉狂的012---No, no, no. Please, Ross. I can't do it. It's gonna freak me out.
好吧  好吧012---Okay, okay, okay.
好  我今晚就告诉她  我不能再跟她见面了012---Okay. I'll tell her tonight I can't see her anymore.
罗斯  谢谢012---Ross, thanks.
你要我现在打给她吗  不  不用012---You want me to call her right now? Oh, no. No, no, no.
那样太夸张了012---I mean, come on, that's craz-I mean, that's crazy.
怎样啊  你最近在干嘛012---So, what's going on with you? What is going on with you?
这个嘛012---Well, um... Oh.
我这学期可能会再开一堂课  好啊  现在就打给她012---I may teach another class this semester. Yeah, do it now. Call her right now.
我最喜欢这段了  我也是012---This is my favorite part. Yeah, me too.
你们知道什么更催泪  《小鹿斑比》012---Oh, you know what's sadder than this? Bambi.
那部片让我哭了3天  不  是2天012---I cried for three days with that movie. No, wait, two.
第三天我妈自杀了  我也在哭那件事012---Because on the third day, my mother killed herself, so I was partly crying for that.
为了那个哭我可以了解   但是《小鹿斑比》是卡通片啊012---Well, see, now, that I can see crying over, but Bambi is a cartoon.
斑比的母亲死了  你没哭012---You didn't cry when Bambi's mother died?
对啊  动画师不再画母鹿了  的确很可怜012---Yes, it was very sad when the guy stopped drawing the deer.
钱德   哭没什么不对  你不必老是那么男子汉012---Chandler, There's nothing wrong with crying. You don't have to be so macho all the time.
我哪有男子汉啊012---I'm not macho.
也对012---Yeah, you're right.
我不知道我在想什么012---I don't know what I was thinking.
反正我就是没哭过   我不是那种会哭的人012---I guess I just never really cried, you know? I'm not a crying kind of guy.
少来啊   你总会遇见令你鼻酸的事012---Come on, man, there's gotta be something that gets you choked up.
像012---Like, uh...
如果你看到一只三脚小狗呢012---What if you saw a three-legged puppy?
我是会难过   但是不会哭012---I'd be sad, sure, but I wouldn't cry.
要是那只小狗说  "钱德救救我012---Okay, what if the puppy said, "Help me, Chandler.
其他的狗狗都欺负我"012---All the other puppies pick on me."
哭啊  我发现了一只会说话的狗   我发了012---Cry? I just found a talking puppy. I'm rich.
我知道了  你小时候的照片012---Oh. I've got it. I have got it. Pictures from your childhood.
你看了一定会哭012---This will get you going good.
那张是什么  那是年级的家长会012---All right, what's going on there? Oh, that's Parents' Day, first grade.
我和校工马丁的合影012---That's me with the janitor, Martin.
你爸妈呢   他们不想去012---Where are your parents? Oh, they didn't wanna come.
钱德  好可怜啊012---Oh, Chandler. You poor thing.
这件事不会让你哭吗012---So that story doesn't make you cry?
不会  我就是不会哭  这没什么  好吗012---No. Look, I don't cry. It's not a big deal, okay?
不  不好  一点也不好012---No. It's not okay. It's not okay at all.
你的心是死的012---You're dead inside.
请问一下  什么事012---Excuse me. Yeah?
你是菲比布非吗   是我012---Are you Phoebe Buffay? Yeah.
可以帮我签名吗   我是你的超级粉丝012---Can I get your autograph? I'm your biggest fan.
你是我的超级粉丝  我一直想认识你   你好012---Oh, you're my biggest fan? I've always wanted to meet you. Hi. Ha, ha.
没问题012---Sure, yeah. Wow.
谢谢你012---Wow, thanks a lot.
我只想说  你真的很有天分012---I just wanna say I think you're really talented.
你是因为崇拜我才这么说的012---You're just saying that because you're my biggest fan.
乔伊   好好招呼那个人  他是个影迷012---Joey, listen, take good care of that guy. okay? He's a fan.
再见012---Bye.
你看过我演的《我们的日子》012---So you saw me on Days of Our Lives, huh?
要我来一段  德瑞克雷莫瑞医生吗012---Want me to, want me to do a little Dr. Drake Ramoray for you?
我不知道你在说什么012---I have no idea what you're talking about.
不过我刚拿到菲比布非的签名012---But I just got Phoebe Buffay's autograph.
你是菲比的影迷  没错  她的电影我都看过012---Oh. You're Phoebe's fan. Oh, yeah. I've seen all her movies.
电影  那是菲比布非  AV巨星012---Movies? That was Phoebe Buffay, the porn star.
不是吧  不  不  是她012---I don't think so. No, no, it was.
她演过《性玩具总动员》012---She was in Sex Toy Story 2...
《女人国的劳伦斯》012---...Lawrence of a Labia.
而我拿到了她的签名012---And I got her autograph.
漫画店的人一定不会相信012---The guys at the comic-book store aren't gonna believe this.
阿甘012---Gunther.
以后别让那个人进来   他说菲比是AV巨星012---Hey, don't let that guy in here anymore. He just said Phoebe's a porn star.
说巨星有点夸张了  不过她真的很猛012---Well, I wouldn't call her a star, but she's really good.
你应该去看《G歪神探》012---You should check out Inspect Her Gadget.
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
说了你一定不信012---You'll never believe what just happened.
罗斯刚刚回绝我  又没说原因012---Ross totally blew me off and didn't even tell me why.
这个嘛  你知道吗012---Oh, well. You know what, honey?
忘掉一个男人最好的办法   就是跟其他人交往012---The best thing to do to get over a guy is to start dating someone else.
我们公司有个鲍伯  你一定喜欢012---Oh. Oh, there is this great guy you will just love at work named Bob.
他是人力资源部的明日之星012---He's a real up-and-comer in Human Resources.
谢谢你替我打气   但我不想随便跟某个阿猫阿狗交往012---Y'know, thanks for trying to cheer me up, but I’m not gonna date some random guy from your work.
不是阿猫阿狗  是鲍伯012---Not random. Bob.
可能是因为我不够成熟  不够聪明012---It's probably because I'm not mature enough or smart enough.
或许他不喜欢我的打扮012---Maybe he doesn't like the way I dress.
不可能的   一定是我不够聪明012---No, that can't be it. It's really gotta be the smart thing. Ugh.
我好笨012---I'm so stupid.
我是个美得冒泡的笨女人012---I'm just this, like, incredibly pretty, stupid girl.
不是012---No, honey.
好吧012---0Kay.
你知道罗斯为何取消约会012---Okay. You wanna know why Ross canceled the date?
是我要求的012---Because I asked him to.
你要求的   嗯嗯012---You asked him to? Mm-hm.
为什么   因为你是我妹妹012---Why? Because you are my sister...
而罗斯和我有一大段爱的渊源012---...and Ross and I have this huge history.
我不懂   你想跟罗斯交往吗  不想012---I don't understand, do you want to go out with Ross? No.
你不要他  又不要我拥有他012---You don't want him, but you don't want me to have him?
人力资源部的鲍伯012---You know, Bob in Human Resources... Ugh.
你居然这样对我   你害的我怀疑我的智商012---I cannot believe you did this to me. You had me doubting how smart I was.
你害的我怀疑我的穿着品味012---You had me doubting my fashion sense.
这又不是什么大事  我只是叫你不要跟罗斯约会012---This is not that big a deal. You just don't date Ross.
世上的男人那么多  你没有资格教我做什么012---There's a million other guys out there. Hey! You have no right to tell me what to do.
我不是在教你做   我是在教你不要做012---I'm not telling you what to do. I am telling you what not to do.
你为什么老是这么嫉妒我   不是我嫉妒你012---Why are you always so jealous of me? This is not about me being jealous of you.
是你太任性  不能吃还想吃012---This is about you being a brat, wanting what you can't have.
不能吃012---Can't have?
很抱歉   我不能吃的东西只有乳制品012---Excuse me, the only thing I can't have is dairy.
好  你和鲍伯的事吹了012---All right, all right. You just blew your chances at dating Bob.
谁  人力资源部的啦012---Who? In Human Resources!
我嫉妒她012---I am jealous of her?
她以为她是谁  卡洛琳公主吗012---I mean, who does she think she is, Princess Caroline?
你嫉妒卡洛琳公主  我有自己的城堡吗012---You're jealous of Princess Caroline? Do I have my own castle?
嘿   菲比不在吧012---Hey. Phoebe's not here, is she?
不在  真好  你们租了片子012---No. Oh, great, did you get a movie?
嗯012---Uh...
耶012---Yeah. Yeah.
但是  我想你们应该不会喜欢吧012---But, uh, I don't think it's the kind you're gonna like.
你该不会又租那种  整夜消耗纸巾的片子吧012---You didn't get more movies that are gonna have us reaching for the tissues all night, did you?
也可以这么说012---Sort of.
到底怎么了012---Guys, what's going on?
菲比是AV女优012---Phoebe's a porn star.
什么  对012---What? Yeah.
你在说什么啊   哪里有012---What are you talking about? Where?
"菲比布非之《魔法欲女》"012---"Phoebe Buffay in Buffay the Vampire Layer."
天哪  这是菲比  你在哪里租的012---Oh, my God. Ha, ha. That's Phoebe. Where did you get that?
布里克街的成人录影店012---Down at the adult video place on Bleecker.
我看到乔伊正要进去  就先跑进去012---And I saw Joey was about to go in, so I ran in ahead of him...
准备吓他012---...to surprise him.
然后我又假装不知道他也在012---And then-Ha, ha. Then I pretended that I didn't know he was in there.
天哪  我真是不敢相信012---Wow. I mean, I just can't-I can't believe this.
真是知人知面不知心啊012---You know? I mean, you think you know someone.
虽然菲比一直是个问号012---even, Even Phoebe, who's always been somewhat of a question mark.
好诡异啊012---This is so bizarre.
不过  毕竟她的童年那么悲惨012---I guess it kind of makes sense, though. She had such a terrible childhood.
我童年悲惨也没去拍A片啊012---Hey, I had a terrible childhood and I don't do porn.
对  但是你的心死了012---Yes, but you're dead inside. Ah.
好吧  我还是拿去还了吧  什么  为什么012---All right, well, I'd better take that back. What? Why? Why?
我们不能看  那是菲比演的012---We can't watch that. I mean, that's Phoebe.
你说得对  我们不该看  没错  拿去还012---Yeah you’re right, We shouldn't watch this. Absolutely not. That goes back.
看一点好了  就看前半段012---But, you know, maybe a little bit. How about just the first half?
嘿  这样不对啊   菲比是我们的朋友012---Hey, no, this is wrong, you guys. Phoebe's our friend.
我不看   没错012---I'm not gonna watch it. Yeah.
有义气   乔伊  对012---Good for you, Joe. Yeah.
我就知道你在这里  纳斯佛拉吐012---Ah. I thought I'd find you here, Nosferatool.
布非  你要把你的尖棍   深深插进我的体内吗012---Buffay, are you going to plunge your stake into my dark places?
其实  我有点希望是你来插我012---Actually, I was kind of hoping it would be the other way around.
等等  她的脚踝上是什么  你在看她的脚踝012---Hold on, what is that on her ankle? Her ankle is what you're watching?
很难看得出来012---Well, it's hard to tell. Ooh.
她能不能不要动了012---Oh, God, if she would just stop moving.
她只是在尽本分012---She's just doing her job.
你们这些变态012---You sick bastards.
是刺青  怪了  菲比可没有012---Oh. It's a tattoo. That's weird. Phoebe doesn't--
等等   那是乌苏拉  不是菲比  是乌苏拉012---Wait, that's Ursula. That's not Phoebe. That is Ursula.
等等  我可以看了  快倒带012---Wait, wait. I can watch that. Rewind it. Rewind it.
嘿  哇哦012---Hey. Oh.
你们在干麻  天哪  我在干什么012---What's up? Oh, my God. What am I doing?!
亲爱的  嘿012---Hey, sweetie. Hey.
《心灵鸡汤》012---Chicken Soup for the Soul?
这张沙发背后是空的012---There's no back to this couch.
你看它干嘛  你不是讨厌这种书嘛012---Why are you reading this? You hate this kind of stuff.
我想试试看012---Yeah I know, but I figured a shot y'know? 
也许有某个故事会让我哭012---Maybe one of those stories would make me cry.
你就不会觉得我的心死了012---Then you wouldn't think I was all dead inside.
你真有心012---Aw, that's so sweet.
钱德  你不会哭也无所谓  我爱你012---Chandler, I don't care if you can't cry. I love you.
这话温暖了我空空如也的胸口012---Oh, that makes me feel so warm in my hollow tin chest.
别闹了  拜托  你想嘛012---Stop it. I mean, come on, seriously. Think about it.
哪天我们结婚了  来到神父面前  我却是这样012---We get married, I'm up at the altar, and I'm like this:
我不在乎012---I won't care.
因为我知道你内心充满喜悦012---Because I know that you'll be feeling it all in here.
是吗  当然012---Yeah? Yeah.
要是有一天我们生小孩012---And if we have a baby one day...
医生在产房把宝宝交给你012---...and the doctor hands it to you in the delivery room...
而你没有哭   那又怎样012---...and you don't cry, so what?
要是我们送他去念大学  然后回家012---And if we take him to college and we come home...
第一次看到他的空房012---...and we see his empty room for the first time...
而你却没反应012---...and you got nothing?
我也不在意012---Won't matter to me.
好012---0Kay.
那我就不那么担心了012---Well, I won't worry about this anymore, then.
那么  如果要是我死了012---Yeah. And, you know, if I die...
久病弃世012---...from a long illness...
你在写哀悼词012---...and you're writing out my eulogy...
然后打开抽屉  看到我留了一张字条写道012---...and you open the desk drawer and find a note from me that says:
"我会永远与你同在"012---"I will always be with you"...
而你还是挤不出一滴眼泪012---...and you still can't shed one tiny tear...
我会知道  你的心早已泪流成河012---...I know you'll be crying a river inside.
我真爱你  怎么搞的012---Aw, I love you, sweet-What is wrong with you?
什么  什么012---What? What?
你居然无法为亡妻流一滴眼泪012---You can't shed a tear for your dead wife?
我死后留了字条给你012---I mean, I left you a note from the beyond.
所以刚才都不是真心话   废话  死机器人012---So you didn't mean any of that? No, you robot!
死小孩  再乱按电铃  我就012---You damn kids. You ring my bell one more time, I swear to--
吉儿012---Oh, uh, Jill. Um...
我在跟走廊那头的小朋友玩012---That's just a little game I play with the kids down the hall.
他们越来越喜欢我了012---They've really taken a liking to me.
有什么事吗012---What's the matter?
瑞秋和我大吵了一架   我可以进去吗012---Rachel and I had a really big fight. Can I come in?
我知道我们不能再见面   我也可以接受012---I know we're not supposed to see each other anymore. I'm okay with that.
只是我人生地不熟  又很需要找个人谈一谈012---I don't know anybody in the city, and I need somebody to talk to about it.
好啊  怎么了  我不想谈012---Oh, of course. What happened? I don't wanna talk about it.
好012---Okay. Um...
不过有一件事会让我比较开心   什么事012---But you know what might really cheer me up? What?
再多看几张你的超酷幻灯片012---Seeing some more of your super-cool slides.
真的吗   绝对的  我爱死了012---Wow, really? Totally. I loved them.
你还可以继续讲解  那几种不同的沙子012---And maybe you could finish telling me about all the different kinds of sand.
没问题  你等一下  我去拿投影机和讲义012---I'd love to. You wait right here. I'll go get the projector and my notes.
太好了  谢谢你  你真是个好朋友012---Oh, great. Thanks, Ross. You're such a good friend.
哇啊012---Oh.
嘿  你们有看到吉儿吗   我到处都找不到她012---Hey. Have you guys seen Jill? I can't find her anywhere.
没看到   在罗斯家吗012---No, I haven't. ls Ross home?
我打过去问他好了012---Maybe I'll just call him and see if he's actually seen her.
哪一位012---Who is it?
是菲比   "菲比"012---It's Phoebe, "Phoebe."
嘿  天哪012---Hey. Oh, God.
所以你在拍A片  没有  我没有啊012---So you're making porn movies. No, I'm not.
摄影机还在拍012---We're still rolling.
你现在就在拍012---You're making one right now.
菲比  快点  而且还用我的名字012---Let's go, Phoebe. And you're using my name.
对  有什么事吗012---Yeah, can I help you with something?
菲比  快点012---Phoebe, come on.
我在跟别人说话   你是在叫她012---Look, I'm talking right now. You're-You mean her. Oh.
双胞胎的题材一向很卖012---You know, twin stuff is always a real big seller.
什么012---What?
我可以帮你谈到30块钱012---Yeah. I could talk them into giving you like $30.
不要  想都别想012---No. No way. No.
别再冒用我的名字  你真丢脸012---And stop using my name. And shame on you.
你们真丢脸   恶心死了012---And shame on all of you. You're disgusting.
尤其是你那个样子012---Especially you, with that.
幻灯片快好了012---Slides are almost ready.
好  我知道还少了什么012---Yeah. Ooh, I know what this is missing.
酒012---Alcohol.
好  厨房有红酒  太好了012---Okay, well, there's wine in the kitchen. Oh, great.
哈罗012---Hello?
我妹妹为什么在你家   窗帘为什么拉上了012---What is my sister doing there, and why are the drapes shut?
好  你别激动012---Okay. Rash, calm down, okay?
她心情很差   我们只是在聊天012---She's really upset. We're just talking.
罗斯  她想借此跟你发生关系   来报复我012---I think she's trying to make something happen with you to get back at me.
所以她来  只是为了这个012---Oh, so that's the only reason she could be here, huh?
会不会是因为我很善于倾听012---It couldn't have anything to do with the fact that I'm a good listener...
而且放的幻灯片又很好看呢012---...and I put on a great slide show?
罗斯  是真的  她在利用你来报复我012---Ross, I am telling you, she is using you to get back at me.
我自己可以应付  回头再聊  再见012---You know, I think I can take care of myself. I'll talk to you later. Goodbye.
是你姐姐打来的012---Uh, that was your sister, actually.
她觉得你在利用我012---She thinks you're just using me. Heh.
所以呢012---So?
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
我刚去过了乌苏拉的公司012---So I just came from the company Ursula works for.
连你  你也下海了012---Oh, no, not you too.
不  我是去领菲比布非的支票012---No, no. I went to pick up Phoebe Buffay's checks.
有很多张啊012---There were a lot of them.
漂亮012---Nice. Mm-hm.
而且我以后不必再去了012---And I won't have to go back there anymore...
我留了我的 "正确" 地址012---...because I gave them my "correct address."
太好了  但别人还是会误会   你不会困扰吗012---That's great, but isn't it gonna bother you that people think you're a porn star?
不   不会的   我有办法012---Oh, no, no. I know how to handle it.
是吗  没错012---Good. Yeah.
想知道你在哪里见过我012---You're trying to figure out where you know me from?
给你一个提示  成人A片  好吗012---All right, I'll give you a hint. From porn. Okay?
没错  你的变态男朋友  在A片里看过我012---Yeah, your pervert boyfriend watched me in a porno movie!
看吧  对啊012---See? Yeah.
嘿012---Hey.
你对吉儿的看法或许没错   我就知道  怎么了012---You, uh, may have been right about Jill. Oh, I knew it. What happened?
她吻了我   什么  你们都亲嘴了012---Um, she kissed me. What? You kissed?
也许我们应该回避一下012---Maybe we should give them some privacy. Shh!
我尽量不去亲她012---Look, I tried not to kiss her, okay?
听起来不像   想不亲一个人012---It doesn't sound like it. It's pretty easy not to kiss someone.
不要亲就对了  我们现在  就没有亲012---You just don't kiss them. See? Look at us right now, not kissing.
让我说完好吗012---Let me finish, okay?
她过来亲我   我没有阻止012---She started kissing me, and I didn't stop it.
而且我也没有多想012---I guess I just wasn't thinking.
是啊   没有多想   我来让你好好想一想012---Yeah,  that's right you weren't thinking! Y'know what? Let me give you something to think about.
等等012---Hold on.
后来我一想  就把她推开了012---But then I started thinking and I stopped the kissing.
谢谢你把舌头  从我妹的嘴里缩回来告诉我012---Oh, well, thank you for taking your tongue out of my sister's mouth long enough to tell me that.
我是想到  如果我跟吉儿怎样012---Look, I realized if anything were to happen with me and Jill...
我们就再也不能怎样了012---...then nothing could ever happen with us.
什么  不  我是说012---What? No, I mean...
我不知道  我们还会不会怎样012---Look, I don't know if anything is ever going to happen with us again, ever.
但我不想断绝这个可能性012---But I don't wanna know that it never could.
于是我喊停012---So I stopped it...
然后  她气得摔坏了我的投影机012---...and she got mad and broke my projector.
哇哦012---Wow.
我都不知道该说什么了012---I don't even know what to say.
谢谢你012---Thank you.
不客气012---You're welcome.
我的天哪   你在哭吗012---Oh, my God, are you crying?
这两个人为何就是不能在一起012---I just don't see why those two can't work things out.
好  我要走了  我要远离某个012---All right, I'm leaving. I'm not gonna spend one more day...
一直害我的人012---...with someone who's out to sabotage my every move.
就是你   瑞秋012---That's you, Rachel.
我知道012---Yeah, I got that.
还有你  我投怀送抱  你却不要012---And you. I throw myself at you, and you say no?
你够同性恋的啊012---How gay are you?
你自己保重   吉儿012---You take care, Jill.
好  再见  再见012---Okay, see you. Bye-bye.
吉儿居然走了012---I can't believe Jill's gone.
我忍不住了  我一发不可收拾012---I can't help it. I opened a gate.
你们猜怎样012---Hey, you guys, guess what?
巴瑞和敏蒂要离婚了012---Barry and Mindy are getting a divorce.
天哪   你是怎么搞的012---What is the matter with you?
不  是巴瑞和敏蒂012---No. Barry and Mindy.
对不起  我一听到离婚就觉得是罗斯012---Oh, sorry. I hear "divorce," I immediately go to Ross. Heh.
谁是巴瑞和敏蒂012---Who's Barry and Mindy?
巴瑞是我差点要嫁的人   敏蒂是我最要好的朋友012---Barry was the guy I almost married, and Mindy was my best friend.
他们不是有一腿嘛012---Wasn't he cheating on you with her?
对   但那只表示他做到一半   会在她身上睡着012---Yeah, but that just means he was falling asleep on top of her instead of me.
要是我真的嫁给他   我的人生会多么不同012---Could you imagine if I actually married him?! I mean how different would my life be?
我懂你的意思   我也总是在想012---I know what you mean, I've always wondered how different my life would be...
要是我没有离婚会怎么样012---...if I'd never gotten divorced.
哪一次   第一次啦012---Which time? The first time!
真的  要是卡萝没发现  她是同性恋012---No seriously, imagine if Carol hadn't realized she was a lesbian.
我无法想像  我老是朝好的方面去想012---I can't. I keep seeing it the good way.
那我一定还在练控手道012---I'd bet I'd still be doing my kara-tay.
后来在我婚姻末期   我经常练控手道012---Towards the end of our marriage, I was doing a lot of kara-tay as a way of releasing the tension...
好发泄一下因缺乏肉体运动而多余的精力012---...from, you know, not doing anything else physical.
也许你不把空手道  念成控手道就没事了012---Maybe the problem was pronouncing it "ka-ra-tay."
如果我还是很胖呢012---And what if I was still fat?
你一定不会跟我交往  当然会012---Well, You wouldn't be dating me, that's for sure.
少来了012---Sure I would.
什么啊  你们真的觉得我那么肤浅012---What? You guys really think that I'm that shallow?
不  我只是觉得摩妮卡太胖012---No, I think Monica was that fat.
要是我没被 《我们的日子》开除呢012---Hey, imagine if I'd never gotten fired off Days of Our Lives.
卡萝又出现了012---Hey. Hey, there's Carol again.
要是我有勇气辞职呢012---What if I had had the guts to quit my job?
我可能在帮《纽约客》写稿   拿搞笑来赚钱012---I'd probably be writing for The New Yorker, being paid to be funny.
现在的工作也很有趣   而且明天012---But my job's fun too. I mean, tomorrow...
上班也不必打领带012---...I don't have to wear a tie.
要是我去美林证券上班呢012---What if I'd taken that job at Merrill Lynch?
什么   美林证券012---What? Merrill Lynch?
对   我有个客人在那上班   他说我天生具有炒股的头脑012---Yeah, I had a massage client who worked there and-and he said I had a knack for stocks.
那你怎么不去012---Well why didn't you take the job?
因为当时我很相信押韵这回事012---Because at that time, you see, I thought that everything that rhymed was true.
我觉得要是我去做股票  就得住地窖012---So I thought y'know that if I'd work with stocks,...
只能吃安眠药  养三脚猫012---...I'd have to live in a box and only eat lox and have a pet fox.
你们觉得如果有这些事   我们还会在一起吗012---Hey, do you guys think that if all those things happened, we'd still hang out?
老友记  第六季  第15集  假想篇外篇（上集）012---Friends  S06E15  The One That Could Have Been

很好   很好   我结婚了  我也是012---Good. Good, I'm married. Oh! Me too! Ha, ha.
结婚真好  不是吗   就是啊012---Isn't it the best? Oh, it's the best. Heh.
摩妮卡好吗   好  真的非常好012---So, um, how's Monica? Really, really great.
事实上  她就在前面  你应该过去打个招呼012---Actually, she's right down the street. Um, you should stop by and say hi.
好啊  我喜欢  她会很高兴的012---Oh, I would love to. Yeah, she'd be so excited.
好  走吧012---Oh, okay. Come on.
等等   你不是要买012---Wait, don't you have to pay for your...
《巨乳女郎》012---...Busty Ladies?
没关系  有个小孩托我帮他买012---No, that's okay. Some kid asked me to pick it up for him, but I...
摩妮卡  你还在跟无聊医生交往012---So, Monica, still going outwith Dr. Boring, huh?
他才不无聊   他只是012---He's not boring. He's just...
只是比较低调012---He's just low-key.
你的榛果拿铁  谢谢012---Here you go, one hazelnut latte. Thank you.
其实榛果不是果实012---You know, the hazelnut, actually not a nut.
而是种籽012---It's a seed.
哇哦012---Wow.
还有谁能说出一种  假装是果实的常见种籽012---Can anyone else name a well-known seed that's been masquerading as a nut?
天哪  我想想看012---Oh, dear God. Let me think.
嘿012---Hey.
你怎么了012---Oh, no. What's the matter?
我又被退稿了012---I got another rejection letter.
他们说我的东西很有趣   只是不符合《阿奇漫画》风012---They said my writing was funny, just not "Archie Comic funny."
亲爱的  我得回医院了012---Y'know what honey? I gotta get back to the hospital.
好012---All right. Okay.
再见  再见012---Bye. 'Bye-bye.
对了  答案是巴西果012---Oh, uh, by the way, the answer is the Brazil nut.
他的问题比他的人更无趣012---Was his question what's more boring than him?
老兄  退稿的事真可惜012---Hey, man. Sorry about that Archie thing.
你要我给你一些钱吗012---You, uh, need me to give you some money?
我穷归穷   还是有骨气012---Hey, I may have no money, but I still have my pride.
是吗012---Really?
是012---Eh.
也许乔伊不必给你钱012---Maybe Joey doesn't have to give you money.
电视明星都有助理  对吧  可行012---TV stars have assistants, right? That's an idea.
要是我请助理转交   你会收吗012---If I hire an assistant, would you take money from her?
不是啦  乔伊  钱德可以当你的助理012---No, Joey. Chandler could be your assistant.
他可以帮你回信给影迷012---See, he could answer your fan mail and stuff.
太好了  好主意   就这么办吧012---That's great! That would be great! Let's do that!
我有钱领   还有时间写作012---I could use the money. Give me time to write.
漂亮  欢迎加入  感谢012---Oh right great! Welcome aboard. Okay!

我上厕所不用人帮   你休息吧012---Since I don't need any assistance in there, take a break!
好吧012---All right.
嘿   嘿   菲比012---Hey. Hey, Phoebe.
你猜怎样   怎样012---Guess what? What?
乔伊找钱德当他的助理012---Joey just hired Chandler to be his assistant.
真太好了012---Oh, that's so sweet.
等一下012---Oh! Hang on!
等我一下012---Hang on!
说012---Go!
不对   不对  我是说一到50点就卖012---No.No,no. I said sell when it hits 50!
50是一个数字  在49后面012---5-0, It's a number! It comes after four-nine!
没关系   一次错误可以接受012---No, it's okay. It's okay. You're allowed one mistake.
开玩笑的   你当然被开除了012---Just kidding. You are of course fired.
嘿  摩妮卡  嘿012---Hey, Mon? Hey.
你看我遇见谁了012---Mon, look who I ran into.
天哪  瑞秋012---Oh, my God, Rachel!
你好漂亮  你也是012---God, you look terrific! Oh, so do you!
谢谢012---Thanks.
你是不是瘦了  这你都注意到了012---Did you lose weight? You are so sweet to notice.
没错  我瘦了三磅半012---Yes, I lost 3 and a half pounds.
记得我的朋友钱德吧  嗨012---And, and uh, you-you remember my friend Chandler? Hi.
那位是菲比  嗨012---And that's Phoebe over there!  Hi.
天哪  快坐下  我们多久没见面了012---Oh my God, sit down. Sit down. How long's it been since we've seen each other?
1987年  圣诞节第二天   西巴麦克曼的派对012---1987, the day after Christmas. Uh, at Sean McMahon’s party.
我弹了我的创作曲给你听  《星际求爱仪式》012---I played you one of my songs. "Interplanetary Courtship Ritual."
喔  对012---Oh, yeah. Right.
你还在玩音乐吗  当然了  偶尔012---So, now, do you, do you still do music? Well, sometimes.

可惜在这里的是我  不是罗杰012---I'm sorry you're here with me instead of Roger.
就是啊012---Yeah, me too.
我可以让你感受到他的存在012---Well, I could make it seem like he's here.
关于库司库司的小常识012---"Here's some little-known facts about cous-cous:
第二个库司  是1979年才加的012---They didn't add the second 'cous' until 1979."
别闹了  一点也不好笑012---Stop it! That's not funny! Okay.
好  对不起012---I'm sorry, okay? It's just...
今晚原本应该很重要的012---...tonight was supposed to be, you know, it was supposed to be a big deal.

是四个不同的女人012---Four different women!
次数就多的太多了012---I've had sex way more times.
几次012---How many?
九次012---Nine.
等待完美的对象012---Waiting for the perfect guy.
很好  这样很好啊  你真的觉得罗杰是那个人012---Well, good. Good for you. You really think Roger's the perfect guy?
不是  但他也不算太糟啊012---No, but he's not a horrible guy.
我也都那样自我介绍的012---That's what I tell girls about me.
钱德   我会死于处女之身012---Chandler, I'm gonna die a virgin!
你不会的  你很好  很棒012---No, you're not. You are sweet and wonderful...

雷莫瑞医生012---Well, with Dr. Drake...
有现成的台词可说012---...they always tell me what to say.
乔伊就得自己办了012---And with Joey, I pretty much have to make it up on my own.
你告诉我  乔伊012---Tell me something Joey. Whoa!
我刚刚从沙发上摔下来   没错012---I just fell right off the couch there. Yeah, you did.
我没事012---I'm okay.
坐好了  我问你一件事  好012---Here you go. Let me ask you a question. Whoops. Yeah.
上次有人012---When was the last time...
称赞你很美丽   是什么时候012---...someone told you just how beautiful you are?
我的手麻了012---I can't feel my hands.
手给我012---Come on. Come here.
我们不能这么做  没错012---We can't do this. No!
吃生蚝   好012---Oyster? Yeah.
要是我们做了  我压力会很大012---If-If! If we did do this, there'd be a lot of pressure on me.
因为你等了很久  我不想让你失望012---y’know? Because you've been waiting a very long time, and I wouldn't want to disappoint you.
但是我没得比较012---Yeah but see I have nothing to compare it to.
就算你很差劲   我哪会知道啊012---So even if you were horrible, how would I know?
我做这个好啊012---I do like that.
我还比较累  我得跟另外四个女人比012---It's harder for me. I have four other women to compete with.
其实  只有三个012---Well, if it helps, there were only three.
所以只有今晚  对吧012---So it'd just be for tonight?
没错   只是朋友在帮朋友的忙012---Absolutely. It would just be one friend helping out another friend.
别说了  我们不能这样做012---Stop it. We're not doing this.
做吧  不行012---Let's do it! No!
好吧  好吧012---"Okay! "Okay!

你知道步骤吗012---Do you have any, uh, moves?
知道一些012---I have some moves.
我就不知道  好012---I have no moves. Okay.
你在干什么012---Oh, okay, what you doing there?
对不起  真的太奇怪了  是啊  还是算了012---Oh y'know what? I'm sorry, this is just too weird. Yeah, forget it.

早安012---Morning.
对喔  没错012---Oh, right. Yeah.
天哪012---Oh, God.
居然让乔伊崔比亚尼  听到我吐012---Oh, I can't believe Joey Tribbiani heard me throw up.
其实他也看到了一点012---He actually saw you a little bit too.
不会吧012---No.
天哪  我们没有012---Oh, God, we-We didn't, uh...?
没有  没有012---No. No. no.
看完就没兴致了012---Not after seeing that.
天啊  我真的是很糟糕012---God, I'm just a horrible person.
为什么  因为我已经结婚了012---Well, why? Because I'm married.
没错  我是有夫之妇012---That's right, I'm a married woman.
还跑到一个电视明星家搞外遇012---I came to a TV star's apartment to have an affair. Ugh!
别傻了012---That's ridiculous.
我才不是明星012---I'm not a "star."
只是一般的名演员012---I'm just a regular famous actor.
而我是一个很糟糕的人012---And I'm a horrible, horrible person.
瑞秋  你别再自责了012---Rachel, will you stop saying that?
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey, look.
你记不记得在节目中  卡普丽临死前012---Remember on the show when Capri was dying?
给了我  石洞里的戒指  记得012---And she gave me-- The ring from the cave. Yeah.
好012---Uh, okay, well...
天哪  他们能让你留着它012---Oh, my God! They let you keep that stuff?
当然  只要不被发现  想留什么都行012---Sure. As long as they don't find out, you can keep whatever you want.
我要把它送给你012---And I want you to have it.
不  不要  要012---No, I couldn't. Yes. Yes.
我让你每次看到它012---And every time you look at it...
就是要记住你是个好人012---...I want you to remember that you are a good person.
你有机会外遇012---Okay, you've had the chance to cheat...
而且还是跟我012---...and with me.
但是你没有  这就是这枚戒指的意义012---But you didn't. And that's what this ring stands for.
我以为它是代表  卡普丽对哥哥永不止息的爱012---But I thought that ring stood for Capri's undying love for her brother.
你到底要不要  我要012---Look, you want the ring or not? Yeah!
嘿  看看你  你醒了012---Hey, look at you! You're up!
太好了  我想出去走一走012---All right. I thought I'd try to take a walk.
你们帮我倒杯水  我马上回来012---You pour me some water. I'll be back soon.
你不是想打公共电话回公司吧012---Whoa, whoa. You're not gonna use the pay phone to call work, are you?
不是  我已经学到教训了012---No. I've learned my lesson.
快点  动作快012---Let's go. Come on. Move it.

嘿  乔伊012---Hey, Joe...
你玩过3P吗012---...did you ever have a threesome?
罗斯  我觉得卡萝很漂亮  我也相信你很有魅力  但是012---Well uh, look Ross. I think Carol's great, and I'm sure you're a very attractive man, but...
不是  我012---No, I--
我之所以问你是因为012---No. The reason I'm asking is that...
我昨晚玩了3P012---...I sort of had one last night.
你  对啊012---You? Yeah.
哇啊  漂亮012---Wow. All right. Yeah.
还  过瘾吗012---So? Was it amazing?
还好啦012---It was, heh...
还好012---okay.
只有还好  你的玩法对吗012---Just okay? Did you do it right?
你有没有在参加派对时觉得012---Look, it's just, did you ever go to a party and think:
"少了我  会有什么差别吗"012---"Would anyone really miss me if I weren't here?"
不过  罗斯012---But still, Ross.
跟两个女人玩得再难玩  也胜过其他日子012---Your worst day with two women, pretty much better than any other day.
你懂吧  那当然012---Oh, oh, no, absolutely.
对  对012---Yeah. Yeah.
只是012---It's just...
我这个部分很快就结束了012---...my part seemed to be over pretty quickly...
然后我就一直等012---...and then there was a lot of waiting around.
你两个都有做到吧012---But you got to be with both of them, right?
没有012---Not really.
我只有跟卡萝做012---Eh, just Carol.
另一个没做  没有  她直接就把我踹开了012---Not the other one? No, she kept kicking me away.
那样很讨厌  就是啊012---You don't want that. No.
不过至少你开了眼界012---Well hey, at least you got to see a lot of stuff.
是大大的开了眼界012---Oh, I saw a lot of stuff.
你后来有点无聊  有一点012---You get a little bored? A little.
我弄了点吃的  是吗012---Yeah. Made a snack. Yeah?
你弄了什么  就是三明治012---What'd you have? Just a sandwich.
火鸡肉  加一点芥末酱012---Turkey. A little mustard.
好像很赞  是很赞012---Sounds good. It really was.
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
跟你说  我昨晚跟一个女生到达本垒了012---Let me tell you about this chick I scored with last night.
等等  就是你嘛012---Oh, no, wait a minute, that was you. Heh.
你看我  我是个堕落的女人012---Hey, check me out. I'm a slut!
晚上要不要找点事情做012---So you, uh, want to do something tonight?
不行  罗杰医生又要来了012---Oh, I can't. Dr. Roger's coming over again.
也对012---Oh. Oh, right. Right.
因为你还在跟他交往  他人很好012---Because you're still seeing him, and, uh, he's a good guy.
我记得有一次012---I remember a time...
你还好吧  好得很012---Are you okay? Yeah, totally.
好得很  你呢012---Totally. Are you?
棒呆了  真的好神奇012---Great. It's so amazing.
上次罗杰来的时候  我好紧张012---Y'know, Last time Dr. Roger came over, I was so nervous.
但是跟你过后  我变成了  "医生可以来看我了吗"012---But after being with you, I'm like, "Can the doctor see me now?"
一定可以012---I'll bet he can.
我虽然没有预约  但是我需要你来体检012---"I don't have an appointment, but I sure could use a physical." Ha, ha.
你真的没事  没事  别管我  我很好012---You sure you're okay? Oh yeah! Yeah! Don't worry about me, I'll be fine.
天哪  巴瑞012---My God! Barry!
你说你周末都不在012---You said you'd be away all weekend! Oh!
没错  对不起  我回来早了012---That's right, I'm sorry. I am early!

嘿  菲比  嘿012---Hey, Pheebs. Hey.
通知警卫012---Call security.
菲比  你不是被开除了吗012---Pheebs, uh, didn't you get fired?
我可不这么认为012---Heh, I don't think so.
菲比  杰克  嘿012---Phoebe? Jack! Hey. Ha,ha.
你来干什么  我好多了  回来上班012---What are you doing here? All better. Back to work.
但这个研究部猪头说我被开除了012---Except this clown from research told me I was fired.
他应该用功一点012---He should do his research, huh? Ha-ha-ha.
你是被开除了012---Well, you were fired.
没有012---Nuh-uh.
我跟帮你接电话的人说了012---I told that guy who answered your phone.
喔  我没收到留言  所以不算012---Oh, okay. I didn't get that message. So this doesn't count.
那我先进办公室了012---Anyway, I'll be in my office. Ah, heh.
菲比  你没有办公室了012---Phoebe, you don't have an office.
没关系  我在这里工作012---All right, I'll work right here.
这里很好  旁边有植物012---This is good. Next to this plant.
菲比  你闯入我的办公室了012---Phoebe, let's-- You're in my office.
我替这家公司赚了很多钱  而且是大钱012---Look, I've made a lot of cash for this company. I am talking big bucks!
披索  日圆  卢布  我才犯了一个小错012---Pesos! Yen! Rubles! You make one little mistake--
你损失了1千3百万元012---You lost 13 million dollars.
原来一切都是为了钱012---So now this is all about money?
我已经够012---You know, it's bad enough that-- Ow!
别闹了吧012---Oh, you have got to be kidding.
你还好吗  我心脏病又发作了012---Are you all right? I'm having another heart attack.
什么   我的心脏病又发作了012---What? I'm having another heart attack!
叫救护车012---Call 911!
猪头012---Dumb-ass!
菲比  你好吗012---Pheebs, how's it going?
我被开除  心脏病发作012---They fired me, and I'm having a heart attack.
欢迎归队  好012---Well, welcome back. Yeah.
嗨  罗斯  嗨  瑞秋012---Hi, Ross. Hi, Rachel.
乔伊崔比亚尼在吗  不在012---Is Joey Tribbiani here? Um, no.
如果你见到他  请转告他我在找他012---Well, if you see him, will you please tell him that I'm looking for him...
这一次  我不会吐了012---...and that this time I am not gonna throw up!
你还好吗  我  我很好啊012---Are you okay? Me? I'm great!
我很好  我好的不得了012---I'm fine! I'm so good.
但是你知道  谁不好吗012---But you know who's not great?
男人012---Men!
你是男人  对吧  罗斯  对012---You're a man, right, Ross? Yeah.
坐下  好012---Sit down. Okay.
我问你一件事012---Let me, uh, ask you something.
婚誓对你们来说是个屁吗012---Do wedding vows mean squat to you people?
为什么我们一说要出门012---And why is it that the second we tell you we're going out of town...
砰  你们就跟邻居的遛狗小妹上床012---...bam, there you are in bed with the neighbor's dog-walker?
我们很抱歉012---We're sorry.
我说真的  婚姻的神圣性呢012---No, seriously. Seriously. What has happened to the sanctity of marriage?
你昨晚不是跟乔伊在一起  你是侦探吗012---Didn't you spend last night at Joey's? Oh, what are you, a detective?
我不知道你和你丈夫怎么了012---I don't know what's going on with you and your husband...
希望那位遛狗妹已经成年012---...and what is hopefully an adult dog-walker.
但我要说  男人并非都是那样012---Look, can I just say, not all men are like that.
有些男人012---Ugh. Hey, there are some men...
愿意尽全力挽回婚姻012---...who'll do whatever to make their marriage work.
有些男人愿意退到一边012---There are some men who will stand by and watch...
看老婆跟健身房刚认识的女人打得火热012---...as their wives engage in what can only be described as a "twosome"...
旁若无人012---...with some woman she barely knows from the gym!
这些男人是谁012---Who are these men?
就是我认识的一个人012---Just men. A guy I know.
你可能要告诉他  听起来他的老婆012---Well, you might want to tell him it sounds like his wife...
像是同性恋012---...is gay.
她才不是012---She is not...
她是同性恋012---She's gay-
天哪012---Oh, my God.
她好同性恋啊012---She is so gay!
我真不敢相信012---I can't believe this.
已婚者的黄道吉日012---Good day for married people, huh?
很遗憾你老公不忠012---I'm sorry your husband cheated on you.
很遗憾你老婆是同性恋012---I'm sorry your wife is gay.
看来女人也没那么好  去告诉我老婆啊012---I guess women aren't that great either. Try telling my wife that.
我可以进来吗  进来  吃饭  随你便012---Okay to come in? Yeah, come in, eat, whatever you want.
罗杰医生又被叫走了012---Dr. Roger got beeped again.
我知道  你猜是谁叫走他的012---Yeah, I know. Guess who beeped him?
什么  我就是那个脾脏破裂的病人012---What? I'm the ruptured spleen. Ha, ha!
你为什么要这样  因为你不该和他在一起012---Why would you do that? Because you shouldn't be with him.
你应该和我在一起012---You should be with me.
是吗  对  听你聊罗杰012---Really? When you were talking about Roger...
让我好痛苦012---...that was killing me. Look.
昨晚的事不能过了就算了012---Things like last night don't just happen.
至少对我来说不是  我是说  你和其他两个女人不同012---At least not to me. I mean, with the other two women...
和她们上床  通常我都早起  急着出去见朋友012---...in the morning, y'know I was just lying there and I couldn't wait to just go hang outwith my friends.
但是跟你012---But with you...
我就像是跟朋友在一起012---...heh, I was, you know, already with a friend.
钱德  你八成不想跟我交往012---Chandler. I know you probably don't want to go out with me.
因为我太爱开玩笑  也没认真谈过感情012---I make too many jokes, I've never been in a serious relationship...
又不是一个 "医生"012---...and I guess I'm not technically a "doctor."
你只有一个女人  对不对012---There was just one woman, wasn't there?
真的  有两个012---No, there were two.
一个是我  正是012---Including me? Oh, yeah.
发了两次心脏病  才终于让你认清012---It only takes two heart attacks To finally make you see
一次死不了  但第二次会让你解脱012---One of them won't do it But the second will set you free
告诉你的恨意与愤怒  是该道别了012---Tell all your hate and anger. It's time to say goodbye
只要我的老板们一死012---And that is just what I will do
我就会这么做012---Soon as those bastards I worked for die
嘿  记得我之前不是养过猴子吗012---Hey, remember when I had a monkey?
对  啊012---Yeah. Mm-hm.
对  我在想什么012---Yeah. what, What was I thinking?
小费怎么才20%   我做错什么事了吗012---Hey, so, what's with the 20 percent tip? Did I do something wrong?
20%很大方了  乔伊012---Twenty percent is a pretty generous tip. Joe.
你知道多少更大方吗   50%012---You know what's more generous than that? Fifty percent.
你知道怎样更大方吗   我知道你想说什么了012---You know what's even more generous? I see where you're going.
你干嘛这么贪心  乔伊   好吧   对不起  只是012---What's up with the greed, Joe? All right, look, I'm sorry, you guys.
我得照新的大头照了012---but it's just that I gotta get these new headshots made...
你们知道  那玩意太贵了012---...and they're really expensive, you know.
我只剩下三张了012---I'm down to like three.
其实是两张  有一张的牙齿被我涂黑012---Actually, two, because one of them I kind of blackened in some teeth.
我干吗拍那玩意啊012---Why'd I do that? Ugh.
你就不能做点什么赚些外快吗012---Well, isn't there something you can do to earn a little extra money?
你能不能  我不知道  例如在这里多轮一班012---I mean, can't you pick up, I don't know, an extra shift here?
也许  你们知道我曾经乞讨过012---Or, you know, I used to beg for money.
当然  如果你能表演这个就肯定有用012---Of course, it helps if you've got, you know, a little of this going on.
我现在还会  对012---Wow, I still have it. Ha, ha. Yeah.
等等  你今天不是有试镜  说不定会被选中012---Oh, wait! wait! don't you have an audition today? Yeah. Maybe you'll get that job.
哈哈哈012---Oh, ha-ha-ha.
等等012---Oh, wait a minute.
我以前常参加医学类实验012---I used to get medical experiments down on me all the time.
难怪变成这样012---Ah, finally, an explanation.
不是  我以前常靠这个赚钱  记得吗012---No, I used to get paid for all kinds of medical stuff, remember?
我想想  我不想再捐精子了012---Let's see. Uh... Well, I don't wanna donate sperm again.
那种事在家做比较好012---I really prefer doing that at the home office, you know?
也许医院会要我的血  口水或其它什么的012---Ooh, ooh, maybe they want some of my blood or spit or something, huh?
乔伊  怎样012---Joey. Yeah?
我说过工作时跟朋友聊天会怎样012---What did I tell you about talking to your friends while you're working?
干得好012---Uh, do it?
那个人等咖啡等了10分钟012---That guy's been waiting for his coffee for 1O minutes.
他抱怨了你三次012---He's complained about you three times.
我讲到哪里012---Well, where was I?
老友记  第六季  第17集  鳗鱼力量012---Friends  S06E17  The One With The Unagi
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
你们在忙什么   我们今天去学了防身术012---Hey, what have you been up to? Oh. We went to a self-defense class today.
哇哦012---Wow.
对  踢了一早上男人的胯部   感觉像是在报复你012---Yeah. Kicking a guy in the crotch all morning really takes it out of you.
报复你012---Takes it out of you? Heh.
现在我们谁都能修理了   没错012---No, now we can kick anybody's ass. Yeah.
就上一堂课   我看不见得012---After one class? I don't think so.
什么  想试试我的防身术吗012---What, you wanna see me self-defend myself?
现在就去  假装你是个性侵犯者012---Go over there and pretend you're a sexual predator.
来吧   你敢吗012---Go on, I dare you.
如果你知道会有攻击   当然会保护自己012---Well, Of course you can defend yourself from an attack you know is coming.
这还不够012---That's not enough.
听着  我学了很久的控手道012---Look, I studied kara-tay for a long time.
有个概念你们一定要了解012---And there's a concept you should really be familiar with.
日文叫做 Unagi012---It's what the Japanese call unagi.
那不是一种寿司吗012---Isn't that a kind of sushi?
不是  那是一种概念  是寿司没错  那是鳗鱼012---No, it's a concept. Yeah, it is, it is. It's freshwater eel.
或许是同一个字吧012---All right, maybe it means that too.
我现在好想吃鲑鱼握寿司012---Oh, I would kill for a salmon-skin roll right now.
好  被攻击活该   我才不在乎012---You know what? Fine, get attacked. I don't even care.
好啦   罗斯  对不起  快告诉我们那是什么啊012---Come on, Ross, we're sorry. Please tell us what it is.
Unagi是一种全知的境界012---Unagi is a state of total awareness.
只有达到真正的Unagi012---Okay? Only by achieving true unagi...
才能应付任何可能出现的危险012---...can you be prepared for any danger that may befall you.
你是说有人要偷你的竹席012---In case someone's trying to steal your bamboo sleeping mat...
或鱼壶的时候吗012---...or your kettle of fish?
我是说  应付彼此攻击012---All I'm saying is, it's one thing being prepared...
是一回事012---...for an attack against, like, each other.
应付偷袭又是另外一回事  我不知道012---Whole other story being prepared for an attack, I don't know--
比如意外012---A surprise!
好  这次你们料到了  但不表示你们有Unagi012---All right, you knew that was coming, but that doesn't mean you have unagi.
你知道吗   现在订位子  半小时后就能吃到鳗鱼012---Ooh! Y'know what? if we made reservations, we could have unagi in about a half-hour.
算了012---You know what?
嘿   摩妮卡在吗  不在012---Hey, hey, is Monica here? No.
帮个忙   我不知道该送什么情人节礼物012---Okay, look, I need your help. I don't know what to get for Valentine's Day.
情人节已经过两星期了  反正是我就不会送她日历012---Well, Valentine's Day was two weeks ago, so I wouldn't get her a calendar.
那天她要上班   我们改今晚庆祝012---Heh. She was working on Valentine's Day, so we're celebrating it tonight.
嘿   要不去帮你们一起订个浪漫的SPA嘛012---Oh, hey, why don't you book a day for both of you at one of those romantic spas?
乔伊   这个主意很棒012---Ooh, Joey, that's actually a really good idea.
还要前面开档的性感内裤012---Yeah, and of course, crotchless panties.
这样  对她的男友来说很有吸引力012---Well, as appealing as that does sound to her boyfriend...
也许包括她的哥哥012---and her brother.
我不能那么做  我们说好了  今年要自己做礼物012---I can't do that we promised we'd make each other gifts this year.
我喜欢  真好012---Oh, I love that. You guys.
你要是不会做开档的内裤  你就012---You can't make crotchless panties? You take--
就拿把剪刀给它剪开   好了012---You take a pair of scissors and just cut-Okay, okay, okay.
不过做礼物   听起来好好玩啊012---So making things, that sounds so much fun.
我也这么认为  直到我的眼睛糊到纸黏土012---Yeah, I thought so to until I paper mached one of my eyes shut.
我喜欢纸黏土  你做了什么012---Oh, I love paper mache! What did you make?
我做了＠#%&!012---I made a:
那是什么啊   什么也不是012---What is that? Nothing.
那你要怎么办012---So, what are you gonna do?
你们有没有做个什么能借给我用012---Have you guys made anything that maybe I can take credit for?
我有  我有  我做了袜子兔012---Ooh, I have, I have. I started making these little sock bunnies.
了不起吧012---Oh, for crying out loud.
等等  那是我的袜子012---Hey, wait a minute. That is my sock.
现在它是你的兔兔朋友了012---Now it's your little bunny friend.
好012---0Kay.
这是一个012---This, this actually is a...
嘿   嘿   甜心012---Hey. Hey, honey.
我能不能问你个情人节礼物的事012---Can I ask you a question about the Valentine's Day gifts?
可以啊  全都要自己做吗012---Oh, yeah. Do we have to make the entire thing?
当然  难道你忘了做了012---Yes. Why, did you—you forget to make yours?
当然  当然没有012---Of course, Of course not.
我只是要去做的地方把它拿回来而已012---I just have to, uh, go over to the place where I-I made it and pick-pick it up.
好的   好的012---okay. okay
我好期待   这会是最棒的情人节012---I can't wait. It's gonna be the best Valentine's Day ever.
我居然忘了  要做礼物  要做礼物012---I can't believe it. Make the presents. Make the presents.
什么   要做礼物好兴奋啊012---What? Just so excited to make the presents!
真是的012---Shoot
你好   我是乔伊崔比亚尼012---Hi, I'm Joey Tribbiani.
我诚心诚意  想捐赠一些体液012---And with all do respect, I'd like to donate some fluids.
我们的研究项目已经快要结束了012---We're actually at the end of one of our research cycles...
目前我们不再需要志愿者了012---...so we're not looking for applicants now.
真可惜   我都存了好一阵子了012---That's too bad. I've kind of been saving up.
真的没有我能参加的研究嘛012---Uh, are you sure there's no studies I can participate in?
这是接下来的研究项目表012---Well, here's a schedule of what's coming up.
谢谢012---Ah, thanks.
可是这个已经开始了012---Oh, but this one starts now.
没错  但只限于双胞胎012---That one is available now, but only identical twins are eligible.
那是双胞胎研究   但是有两千块钱012---It's a twin study. But it's $2000.
抱歉012---Sorry. Oh.
那这个怎么样012---Well, how about this one?
"乔伊崔比亚尼对美女接待的影响力实验呢"012---"Testing the Effects of Joey Tribbiani on Attractive Nurse Receptionists."
结果已经出来了  不太理想012---We already got the results back on that one, and they're not good.
那真的不错  很棒对不对012---That was good. Wasn't that a blast?
危险  危险  天啊   罗斯012---Danger! Danger! God, Ross!
你搞什么啊012---What the hell was that?
让你们认识unagi的重要性012---A lesson in the importance of unagi.
你这个变态012---You're a freak.
或许吧012---Perhaps.
现在  我很好奇012---Now, I'm curious.
你们要尖叫到什么时候   才敢要修理我啊012---At what point during those girlish screams would you have begun to kick my ass?
好吧   我们没有准备好012---All right, so we weren't prepared.
抱歉啊  使用这么激烈的方式来传达我的观点012---I'm sorry I had to take such drastic measures to make my point.
不过我  看嘛  是为你们的安全着想012---But, but I—look, I just want you guys to be safe.
危险012---Danger!
嗯哼  Unagi012---Ah, huh? Unagi.
两千块钱好多啊012---Two thousand bucks is a lot of money.
真想有个双胞胎兄弟012---Oh, I wish I had a twin.
到哪里才能找到012---Where could I find someone...
跟我长得一样的人啊012---...who looks exactly like me?
嘿012---Hey.
钱德012---Chandler.
我感觉到是你012---I sensed it was you.
什么012---What?
Unagi012---Unagi.
我永远全知012---I'm always aware.
你知道Unagi是鳗鱼吗012---Okay, are you aware that unagi is an eel?
什么事  我不知道该给摩妮卡做什么礼物012---What's up? I can't figure out what to make Monica.
你可以给她讲个笑话012---Oh. Why don't you make her one of your little jokes?
我快急死了  知道吗012---I'm going crazy, okay?
有没有什么看起来像是自制的东西012---Do you have anything around here that looks homemade?
知道吗   这个她一定会喜欢012---Oh, you know what? She'd love this.
这是阿波罗八号的模型  我六年级做的012---It's an exact replica of Apollo 8. I made it in the sixth grade.
这个也许可以用   我可以说 "你的爱让我飞上月亮"012---Yeah, I guess I could use that. I could say, "Your love sends me to the moon."
对  可是阿波罗八号没有登陆过月球012---Yeah, yeah. Except Apollo 8 didn't actually land on the moon.
不过你可以写012---But you could write, urn:
"你的爱  让我绕月球两圈后顺利返航"012---"Your love lets me orbit the moon twice and return safely."
等等  我不能送这个012---Wait, I can't give this to her.
为什么  因为旁边写着 "罗斯队长"012---Why not? It says "Captain Ross" on the side.
底下写着  "我讨厌摩妮卡"012---And it says "I hate Monica" on the bottom. Oh.
危险  危险012---Danger! Aah!
鲑鱼握寿司012---Ah. Salmon-skin roll.
好012---Okay, okay.
没错   甜心  这是我自己做的012---Yes, honey, I made it myself.

我录了一盒浪漫情歌给你012---But I made you a tape of what I think are all romantic songs.
好棒的礼物012---What a great gift.
有《你今晚的模样》吗012---Is "The Way You Look Tonight" on it?
或许听了就知道了012---Maybe. We'll have to listen and see.
我好喜欢喔   谢谢你  不客气012---Oh, I love it. Thank you so much. Mwah. Aw. Okay. Mwah.
你要拆你的了吗012---Okay, you ready to open yours?

对  我不是有叫你小兔兔012---Ha, ha. Yeah, yeah. Remember how I call you "bunny"?
有吗012---Not really.
我叫过你一次   以后我想多叫012---Well, I did one time. And I wanna start doing it more.
所以做了袜子兔   我懂了012---See that's what this is about. I see.
菲比也做袜子兔012---You know, urn, Phoebe makes sock bunnies.
不   不   她没有012---No. No, she doesn't.
菲比做的是袜子兔子012---Phoebe, what she makes, that's-They're sock rabbits.
完全不一样   好啦  好啦012---They're completely different. Okay, okay. Okay!
这不是我做的  对不起   我完全忘了今晚012---Okay, I didn't make it. I'm sorry. I totally forgot about tonight...
和做礼物的事了012---...and that we were supposed to make the presents.
没关系  我也  不  不  当然有关系了012---Oh, it's okay. I don't-No, no, it's not okay. It's not.
你那么  你那么的用心012---I mean you were just... You're so incredible!
花那么多心血录情歌给我012---You went through all this time and effort to make this tape for me.
我要补偿你  我一定会的  一定要012---You know, I'm just gonna-I'm gonna make this up to you. I will.
我会下厨房煮你想吃的菜012---I am going to cook you anything you want in here.
进卧室玩你想玩的花样012---And I'm going to do anything you want in there.
我的确花了很多心血012---Well, I did put a lot of thought into the tape.
你还小  不该看的012---You are way too young to have seen that. Oops. Ha, ha.
再1个半月就是你的生日012---Your birthday's in a month and a half.
要是我又忘记准备礼物呢012---What do you say I forget to get you a present for that too?
我百分之百完全原谅你012---You are totally and completely 100 percent forgiven.
那个得拿去洗   没错012---We have got to wash that. Yeah.
你不是看上一件外套012---Hey, do you remember that jacket that you loved so much...
嫌它太贵   你对我已经够好了012---...that you thought was too expensive? You have done enough.
我要一大早跑去买来送你012---Ha, ha. I'm gonna wake up early and get it for you.
你不必买黑色   别买咖啡色012---No, you don't have-Get it in black, not brown.
你的蛋糕好了012---Oop. Your cake is ready. Oop.
俗话说得好  "做做爱爱  吃吃蛋糕"012---It's like that old saying, "have some sex, eat some cake."
小摩   老钱   我来拿汽水012---Hey, Mon. Hey, Chan. Just getting a soda.

我代替卡尔道歉  卡尔是谁012---Look, I got to apologize on behalf of Carl. Who the hell is Carl?
我没说吗012---Oh, did I not mention?
我找卡尔来演我的双胞胎兄弟   好参加医学研究012---Carl is a guy I hired to be my identical twin for a medical research project.
有时妙计就在眼前  是吧012---You know, sometimes the good ideas are just right in front of you, aren't they?
我知道这有点疯狂   不过我认为也许能行得通012---Look, I know it sounds crazy, but I think it might work.
唯一的问题是卡尔的演技012---But the only problem is Carl's acting is:
唯一的问题012---The only problem?
对  他害我两年前  痛失那条果汁大广告  记得吗012---Yeah. He's the reason I didn't get that big Minute Maid commercial a couple of years ago remember?
我们演兄弟   他却搞砸了012---We were supposed to be brothers, but he messed it up.
嘿   我可以吃一小块蛋糕吗012---Hey. Can I get a little piece of that cake?

不是你是不是  是你有没有012---It's not something you are, it's something you have.
快说012---Say it.
我可以轻易挣脱012---I could easily get out of this...
但你们可能会死得很惨012---...but there's a chance you could get very, very hurt.
好  卡尔  接着就是我们  记住  这次不能怎样012---All right, Carl, we're next. Now, remember, what is this not gonna be?
重蹈那次果汁广告的覆辙  没错012---Another Minute Maid fiasco. That's right.
你不能怎样012---And what are you not gonna do?
我不能讲话  因为  你还讲  卡尔012---I'm not gonna talk, because-Ah. Damn it, Carl.

我看得很仔细012---Yeah, yeah. I was watching.
嘿  不过我有一些问题012---Um, hey, a couple of questions, though.
刚才最后012---Um, you know that last move...
那个女人把你绊倒  压在地上012---...where that woman tripped you and then pinned you to the floor?
你接下来会怎么做012---What would you do next?
她会拿钥匙来刺012---Well, then she'd take her keys and jam them in your--
不  不是  是你会怎么做012---No, no, no. What would you do next?
你是说攻击者  是的012---Who, me, the attacker? Yes, that's right.

我想偷袭两个女人  却没成功012---I tried attacking two women. Did not work.
什么  没关系012---What? No, I mean, it's okay.
她们是我的朋友  我还跟其中一个结过婚012---I mean, they're my friends. In fact, I was married to one of them.
说白了  你偷袭你的前妻012---Let me get this straight. You attacked your ex-wife?
不  不是012---Oh, no, no, no. Heh.
我试图偷袭012---I tried.
却打不过她   所以才来找你012---But I couldn't. That's why I'm here.
或许我们可以一起对付她们012---Maybe we could attack them together.
你不要012---That's a no.
我非常非常非常对不起012---I am so, so, so sorry.
我会下厨房煮你想吃的菜012---Oh! And I will cook anything you want in here...
进卧室玩你想玩的花样012---...and do anything you want in there.
你当然得煮   你想得美012---Yeah, you will, and are you kidding me?

瑞秋  是他们先来的012---No, Rachel, they got here first.
罗斯在干嘛   危险012---Why is Ross doing that? Danger!
天哪  他干嘛扑向那两个女人012---Oh, my God. Why is he jumping on those women?
我们应该去帮她们012---We should help them.
我看她们不需要帮忙012---I don't think they need any help.
嘿012---Hey.
我刚拿到教师评监表  你们听这个学生写的012---I just got my teacher evaluations. Check out what this one student wrote.
"我爱盖勒博士的课   令人大呼过瘾"012---"I loved Dr. Geller's class. Mind-blowing lectures.
"盖勒博士  您是古生物学系的猛男"012---Dr. Geller, you are definitely the hottie of the Paleontology Department."
"古生物学系的猛男"012---Ah, "Hotties of the Paleontology Department."
做成月历一定好卖012---There's a big-selling calendar, huh?
谁写的012---Who wrote it?
我也想知道  但评监表是匿名的012---Oh, I wish I knew, but the evaluations are all anonymous.
期末考卷还在吗   在啊012---Do you still have their final exams? Yeah.
你可以拿考卷来对笔迹   就知道仰慕者是谁了012---Oh,‘cause you can just match the evaluation to the exam with the same handwriting and boom, there's your admirer.
只要和女色有关  他就成了大天才012---A hot girl's at stake and all of a sudden he's Rain Man.
等等  等等  为何确定一定是个女生012---Hey, wait a minute, wait a minute. Why are we so sure that this is a girl?
是女生012---It's a girl.
对啊  总之没差012---Anyway, it wouldn't matter, okay?
因为我是老师  她是学生  那要违反校规的012---Because I'm a teacher. She's a student. Oh, is that against the rules?
不会  但是会有争议  了解012---No, but it is frowned upon. I see.
而且年龄相差那么多  你就这么想  等你90岁012---Besides, there's a big age difference. Think of it like this. When you're 90--
我知道  我90她就80012---I know, when I'm 90, she'll be 80...
感觉就差不多了012---..and it won't seem like such a big difference.
不是  我不是要说这个012---No, that's not what I was gonna say at all.
我是说等你90岁012---What I was gonna say is when you're 90...
还能拥有跟20岁小妹妹恋爱的回忆012---...you'll still have the memory of what it was like to be with a 20-year-old.

什么是动作课012---What's a movement class?
钱德在假装他没修过默剧012---It's Chandler's way of pretending he didn't take mime.
总之  她要导艾尔帕西诺的新片012---Oh well listen, anyway, she's directing the new Al Pacino movie.

你本来就欠我   你欠我3千4百012---You do owe me so much. You owe me 3400--
嘿   老兄   你干嘛转移话题   什么012---Hey, hey, dude. Why you changing the subject? What?
你打不打电话  好吧  我试试看012---Will you make the call or what? Okay, I'll try.
万岁  谢了  你最好了012---All right. Thanks, you're the best.

嘿  摩妮卡  我要听留言  你在厕所里想到这个012---Hey, Mon, I'm gonna check my messages. You just thought of that in there?
当然  生理需求结束  她想知道还有谁需要她012---Sure, you know, nature called. She wants to see who else did.
喂012---Hello?
嗯012---Uh...
瑞秋012---Rachel.
我们家有人  快报警012---You guys, someone is in our apartment. Call the cops.
你在用电话012---You're on the phone.
天哪  天哪   什么012---Oh, my God. What?
天哪  谢谢你  是消防队012---Oh, my God. Thank you. That was the Fire Department.
家里失火了  天哪   有多严重012---There was a fire at our place. Oh, my God. How bad was it?
他没说  但失火总是不太妙嘛012---He didn't say, but it was a fire. I'm guessing not very good.
快走吧  快走  菲比  快点012---Come on, we gotta go. Phoebe, come on.
笑什么笑   有什么好笑的012---What are you smiling about? What is so funny?
我要应征的角色是消防队员   这真是天意012---The part I wanna audition for is a fireman. This is so meant to be.
哇  你这学期的成绩给得很大方啊012---Wow. Looks like you were very generous with your grades this semester.
盖勒教授  是012---Professor Geller? Yeah? Huh?
我只是要说   我很喜欢你的课012---I wanted to say how much I enjoyed your class.
谢谢你  非常感谢012---Oh, thank you. Thanks very much. Ow.
很不好意思   在评监表说你是猛男012---I'm a little embarrassed about calling you a hottie on my evaluation.
那就是你   对012---That was you? Yeah.
我后来觉得怪怪的  你是老师  我是学生012---I felt a little weird about it. You're a teacher. I'm a student.
但或许你愿意和我约会012---But would you maybe wanna go out with me sometime?
喔   我想  这样恐怕不太好吧012---Oh, I-Heh. I don't think that would be the best idea.
我想说学期结束后012---Oh, because I was thinking, um, the semester's over.
你就不是我的老师了  什么时候012---You're not my teacher anymore. What time?
当我没说   你已经给我A了012---Oh, you know what? Forget it. I see you already gave me an A.
了解   开玩笑的012---Gotcha. I'm kidding. Ha-ha-ha.
哇哦  哈哈哈012---Oh. Ha-ha-ha. Ha-ha-ha.
说真的  什么时候012---So seriously, what time?
借过  借过  你好012---Coming through. Oh. Coming through. Oh. Hello. Hi.
不  不对  借过012---No, right. Corning through.
还好嘛012---Oh. Okay. Well, it's not so bad.
灾情主要集中在卧房012---Yeah, Most of the damage is pretty mostly contained to the bedrooms.
天哪012---Oh, my God.
老兄   这星期四可以跟你借制服吗012---Hey, buddy, you think I could borrow your uniform this Thursday?
什么   乔伊   人家在忙012---Excuse me? Joey. He's working.
你穿一定很帅012---You would look good in that.
灾情如何   很惨  非常的惨012---Uh-oh. How bad is it? Oh, it's bad, it's really bad.
只有一把斧头没被烧到   我根本不记得有买过012---The only thing that isn't burned is an ax, which I do not remember buying.
瑞秋  你的呢  东西都烧光了012---How's your room, Rach? Everything's ruined.
床铺  衣服  你看我最喜欢的蓝毛衣012---My bed, my clothes. Look at my favorite blue sweater.
那不是我的吗012---Isn't that mine?
好吧   我对你的损失深表遗憾012---Fine. I'm sorry for your loss.
这里暂时不能住人了012---So uh, you're not gonna be able to live here for a while.
你们有地方去吗012---You ladies have a place to stay? Oh. Wow.
好  你听着012---Okay, look, pal...
老兄   我现在没心情跟人搭讪012---...I am not in the mood to be hit on right now.
不过要是你给我电话   我改天会打给你012---But if you give me your number, I will call you some other time.
她们可以跟我们住012---Yes, they can stay with us.
请问起火原因是什么   消防员012---Have you figured out what started the fire, Mr. Fireman?
你们有人抽烟吗012---Well, uh, do either of you smoke?
没有012---No, not usually.
不过现在来一根也好   谢谢  不012---But yeah, I could use one now. Thanks. No, no.
你们有人点蜡烛烧香吗   有  我常点  我很喜欢012---Do you light candles, burn incense? Yes, I do all the time. I love them.
天哪  是我害的  是我  是我012---Oh, my God, I did it. It's me, it's me.
我把房子给烧了   我把房子给烧了012---I burned down the house. I burned down the house!
菲比  别激动  没有必要怪谁  好吗012---Okay, Phoebe, calm down. There's no need to place blame. Okay?
我警告过她012---I warned her about those candles.
能聊聊真好   居然这么久了012---It's great to catch up. I can't believe how long it's been.
钱德   是不是012---Hey, Chandler, is that...?
太好了  恭喜你  听着012---Oh, that's great. Good for you. So, hey, hey, is it...?
好  我们可以见个面012---Okay, so, yeah, maybe we can get together, um...
你等我一下怎样012---Can you hold on for one second, please?
什么012---What?
等你讲完   要不要叫彼萨012---When you're off the phone, you wanna get a pizza?
嗨   我回来了012---Hi, I'm back.
听起来不错   好  就这么决定  好  再见012---Yeah, that sounds great. Okay, well, we'll do it then. Okay, bye.
我什么时候试镜  我知道是星期四  但是几点012---Hey, listen, so when's my audition? I know it's Thursday, but what time?
嗨  嘿  我们没聊到那个012---Hi. We didn't get to the audition.
我带她去喝咖啡时再说吧  好012---I'm gonna take her to coffee and do it then. Ah.
哇  你要跟这个女生约会012---Wow, so now you're going on a date with this girl?
这不是约会  我们失联10年了012---Not a date. I haven't talked to her in 10 years.
总不能一通电话过去  就要人家帮忙吧012---You can't call somebody you haven't talked to in 10 years and ask for a favor.
要讲人情世故   花点时间客套012---There are rules, you know? You gotta put in some time.
没错  对不起012---You're right, I'm sorry.
你又不是去见旧情人  不  我们只约过一次会012---It's not like you're going out with an ex. No, we only went out once.
你跟她交往过012---You dated her?
一次也没有012---Not once.
干脆我也去找个前男友  来帮乔伊的忙012---Great. Why don't I just go outwith an ex, you know, and do Joey a favor?
想帮乔伊的忙   就跟乔伊约会012---Hey, you wanna do Joey a favor? Maybe you go out with Joey.
真好   我朋友乔伊也在电影圈012---Oh. That's great. My friend Joey's in the movie business.
你猜我那天遇见谁   豪伊012---Mm. You know who I ran into from school? Howie.
我的朋友叫乔伊012---Hmm. My friend's name is Joey. Heh.
显然  豪伊在当剪接师012---Apparently, Howie's editing now.
他打来问我能不能剪我的新片012---Yeah, he calls me up and asks me if he can edit my new movie.
你相信吗012---Heh. Can you believe that?
我们10年没联络012---You know, I haven't spoken to him in, what, 10 years...
他居然来找我帮忙012---...and he asks me for a favor?
我一向很讨厌那家伙012---Yeah, I've always hated that Howie.
连声好都没问过012---No "How you doing?" Heh.
连先喝一杯咖啡都没有012---Man, I mean, not even a cup of coffee first.
好大胆   就是啊012---Heh. The nerve, huh? Yeah.
续杯吗012---Refill?
这是等待已久的时刻   但是抱歉  房里一团乱012---Now, this is last-minute, so I want to apologize for the mess.
没人介意啊012---Oh.  Who cares?
天哪012---Oh, my God.
我住的这儿的时候   绝对不是长这样012---It sure didn't look this way when I lived here.
我知道012---I know.
问题是  这里012---Now look, There's only one problem, though.
只能睡一个人  另一个人得去住乔伊家012---There's only room for one, so I guess one of you will have to stay at Joey's.
既然火算是我放的   你就睡这里吧012---Well, since the fire was kind of my fault, I guess you should get to stay here.
嘿   嘿   嘿012---Hey, hey, hey, now.
谁也没有错  菲比  那只是个意外012---this was no one's fault, Pheebs, okay? It was an accident.
不  是我害的  你应该睡这里012---Well no, It was my fault. You should get the nice room.
好吧012---Okay. Whoo!
瑞秋   你是摩妮卡饭店的首位贵客012---So, Rach, you're the first guest at Hotel Monica.
摩妮卡饭店012---Hotel Monica.
你得告诉我早餐想吃什么蛋012---Umm, you'll just have to tell me how you like your eggs in the morning.
我打算端到床上给你012---I thought I'd bring them to you, you know, in bed.
你吃了这么多苦012---Aw. You've been through so much.
就是啊012---I have.
这是我放彼萨的地方012---This right here is where I keep the pizza.
那里  放纸巾012---And that's where the napkin is.
什么味道  就是啊  不清楚012---What's that smell? I know. I don't...
拜托  那么大一个班   你根本没有注意到我012---Oh, please, it was such a big class. You never even noticed me.
什么啊   当然有  你坐在昏昏欲睡的瞌睡虫旁边012---What? Of course I did. You sat next to Sleepy Sleeperson.
谁012---Who?
我记不住全班的名字012---Oh. I had trouble remembering everyone's names...
就取绰号代替012---...so I came up with nicknames.
像你的另一边是   臭臭冯党卫队012---Like the guy on the other side of you was Smelly von Brown-Shirt.
没错012---Oh, yeah. Ha, ha.
你给我取过绰号没有   没有012---So, um, did you have a nickname for me? Uh, no. No.
你肯定有   是什么012---Yes, you did. What was it?
嗯012---Um, it's...
可爱麦美眉012---Cutie McPretty.
哦  太可爱了012---Oh, that's so sweet.
真好  说真的  今晚真的很开心012---Listen, I gotta tell you, I'm having a great time.
你之前说师生约会很奇怪012---You know how before you said it might be weird, the whole student-teacher thing?
其实我也有同感   但结果不是这样   一点也不奇怪012---And to be frank, I thought it would be too. But it's not. I mean, it's not at all.
盖勒博士  伯特012---Dr. Geller. Burt.
你昨晚睡得好吗012---So did you sleep well last night?
很好   对啊012---I did. Yeah?
很好  摩妮卡太好了  在我枕头旁  放了一小片薄荷012---I did. Monica was so sweet. She left a little mint on my pillow.
你猜乔伊在我枕头上放了什么   什么012---Know what Joey left on my pillow?  What?
口香糖012---Gum.
找到起火原因了  我知道  是我的蜡烛害的012---Well, we determined the cause of the fire. Yeah, I know. It was my candle, my candle.
不是  浴室有个电器没拔掉012---No, there was an appliance left on in the bathroom.
好像是卷发器012---It looks like a curling iron.
我没用卷发器   那是总有人在用012---I don't use a curling iron. Well, someone does.
别看我  我的头发是直的  直的直的直的012---Well, don't look at me! my hair's straight. Straight, straight, straight.
也可能是直发夹012---It could've been a hair-straightener. Oh.
彼萨都放这里012---This is where I keep the pizza.
纸巾呢012---And-Hey, where'd the napkin go?
好了  可不能让贵客眼睛疲劳012---There you go. I wouldn't want my best guest to strain her eyes.
谢谢  摩妮卡012---Thanks, Monica.
你怕那个味道吗  什么  乔伊家的味道012---Does that smell bother you? What, the smell from Joey's?
不怕啊  这里又闻不到012---No, I can hardly smell it over here.
闻得到就说  我可以烤个派把它盖过去012---Well, you let me know if you can. Because I can bake a pie to cover it.
有点闻得到   烤个派吧  好啊012---I can smell it a little. Bake the pie. Okay.
喂012---Hello?
在  请稍候  火场调查员找你012---Oh, yes, one minute, please. It's for you. It's the fire inspector.
喂  我是菲比012---Oh. Hello? Yeah, this is Phoebe.
是吗012---Really?
是的  调查结果出来了  不是直发夹012---Yeah, so it turns out that it wasn't the hair-straightener...
引起的火灾012---...that started the fire.
不  不  是因为蜡烛012---No, no. It was the candles.
点燃蜡烛后不注意   实在太糟糕了012---Yeah. It's very not good leaving candles unattended.
消防学校最先教的事情之一就是这个012---In fact, one of the first things they teach you in fire school is--
嗯012---Uh...
好  我该挂了012---Uh, okay, well, I have to go now.
我们玩得好开心  她好棒012---We had such a great time. She's incredible.
我以为年龄会成为问题   结果不会012---I thought the age difference might be a problem, but it wasn't.
一点也不会   就她的年纪来说   伊丽莎白非常成熟012---It wasn't at all. Elizabeth is very mature for her age.
有些人就是不懂012---A concept lost on some people.
所以师生可以约会012---So it's okay to date a student?
好吧  也不全是012---Well, not really.
技术上讲呢   没触犯校规或什么的012---I mean, technically, it's not against the rules or anything.
但是会受到争议012---But it is frowned upon...
尤其是我们昨晚遇见的教授012---...especially by that professor we ran into last night.
属于自以为是的学者012---Judgy von Holier-Than-Thou.
罗斯  小心一点012---Well Ross, you be careful now. 
别被叫成爱泡麦学生教授012---You don't wanna get a reputation as y'know Professor McNails-His-Students. Ha, ha.
我该怎么办   罗斯   这很清楚啊012---Yeah. What should I do? Well, Ross, it seems pretty clear.
什么更重要   别人的看法还是你的感觉012---I mean, what's more important, what people think or how you feel? Huh?
你得忠于你的内心  乔伊   说得真好012---Ross, you gotta follow your heart. Joey, that is so sweet.
嘿   嘿   你跟黛娜谈得怎样012---Hey. Hey, hey. So how'd it go with Dana?
我星期四该不该腾出时间来012---Any reason I should leave a block of time open, say, Thursday?
我说不出口  你说不出口012---I couldn't do it. You couldn't do it?
别急  我需要更多的时间  我们晚上要吃饭012---Relax, I just need more time. We're going to dinner.
什么   你还要跟她出去012---What? You're going outwith her again?
跟谁出去   大学的黛娜基史东012---Going out with who? Dana Keystone, from college.
喔   对   她不是012---Oh, yeah. Wasn't she, uh, mm...?
不   那是黛娜卡普林012---No, that was Dana Kaplan.
哦  嗯012---Oh. Ah.
乔伊   你根本不认识她   那又怎样012---Joey, you didn't even know her. Yeah, whatever.
故事真的好棒012---Great story again.
好错综复杂012---The yarns that you weave.
我该走了  真的  我得走了012---You know, uh, actually, I should get going.
不  不  不   留下来吧012---Oh, no, no, no, stay, stay, because you should--
你该留下来012---You should stay.
我真的很受宠若惊012---Oh, I am really flattered.
只是  我对你没那种感觉012---But I just... I don't feel that way about you.
不  不  不  我不是  不是  钱德  对不起012---Oh, no, no, no. That's not-No, no, no. I'm sorry, Chandler.
你人很好   我也不想伤害你012---You know, you are such a sweet guy, and I don't wanna hurt you.
真希望我可以做点什么让你好过点012---Oh, I wish there were something I could do to make you feel better.
不  不  真的吗012---No, no, no-Really?
当然012---Of course.
我真是太伤心了  我012---Well, it just hurts so bad, I, uh...
对不起012---Oh, I'm sorry.
或许你可以做一件事   什么事   你尽管说012---Well, maybe there is one thing you can do. What? Anything. Anything.
我是刚刚才想到的012---Well, I mean, this is just off the top of my head now. Um...
我有个演员朋友012---Ahem. But I have this friend, uh, this actor friend...
他要是知道我这么做的话   一定会杀了我012---...and he would kill me if he knew that I was doing this, um...
可以的话  能不能给他一次参加你的新电影试镜的机会012---...but, um, would it be possible for him to get an audition for your movie...
比如说  星期四012---...say, on Thursday?
没问题012---Absolutely.
但是我让你的朋友来试镜012---But you'd really feel better about me rejecting you...
真的能让你好过一点012---...if your friend can audition for my movie?
这是我的心愿   再见012---Well, the heart wants what it wants. I'll see you later.
嘿  怎么样啊012---Hey. How's it going?
这5分钟都没什么太大的变化012---Well, not much has changed in the last five minutes.
其实有  我烤了饼干012---Yes, it has. I made cookies.
算了   我还在消化你做的薯片012---That's all right. I'm still full from your homemade potato chips, so...
但是饼干刚烤好   应该趁热吃012---Oh. But you should eat them now because they're hot from the oven.
好  但不能在这里吃012---Okay. Oh. But not in here.
床上不能吃饼干  记得吗  不能掉屑屑012---Can't eat them in bed, remember? No crummies.
好吧012---Oh.
好  我马上出去012---I'll be out in a second.
好吧012---0Kay.
你在干什么  门锁不起来  对吧012---What are you doing? This doesn't lock, does it'?
乔伊  对不起  没关系  别担心012---Oh. Joey, sorry. Oh. Oh, it's all right, don't worry about it.
但是你看   会留下污渍012---No, but look. Oh, that's gonna leave a stain.
瑞秋   没关系   这是乔伊家012---Rach, hey, it's fine. You're at Joey's.
真的吗  当然  你看012---Really? Yeah, look.
我没有这样吃过东西   我知道012---I've never lived like this before. I know.
好吧   别浪费了  我是说它还能吃呢012---All right, well, don't waste it. I mean, it's still food.
接下来要干嘛   要不要去喝杯酒012---What do you wanna do now, huh? You wanna go get a drink?
哦   我不行012---Uh, I can't.
你要念书   不是   我要满21岁才行012---Oh, you have some studying to do? No, I have some turning 21 to do.
好吧  呵呵012---Okay. Ha, ha.
我以前念大学时  我们都经常012---You know, I remember when I was in college, we used to--
你干什么  没事   我只是012---What are you doing? Nothing, I'm just--
只是觉得和你在一起很舒服012---I'm so comfortable with you.
你怕被别人看见吧   什么啊012---Do you not wanna be seen with me? What?
不  当然不是  他们走了吗012---No, of course I do. Are they gone?
没有  他们还在  不过我想我该走了012---No, they're still here. But I think I'm about to leave.
什么  不  不  等一下012---What? No, no, wait, wait.
你说得对   这样太蠢了  管别人怎么想012---You're right, this is stupid. Who cares what people think?
我们情投意合  对吧   这样并没有错012---I mean, we like each other, right? There's nothing wrong with that.
来吧012---Come on.
伯特  莉蒂亚  梅尔012---Burt. Lydia. Mel.

你不是在修我的流行文化课嘛012---Aren't you in my Popular Culture class?
没错   莉蒂亚  伊丽莎白是学生012---That's right, Lydia. Elizabeth here is a student.
我们在约会012---And we're dating.
你们可以皱眉摇头012---And you may frown upon that...
但我们不会再躲躲藏藏的了012---...but we're not gonna hide it anymore.
你肯定会被解雇的012---You are so fired.
什么   你会被解聘012---What? They're gonna fire you.
你不能和学生约会   这违反校规012---You can't date a student. It's against the rules.
真的  不只是受到争议012---Really? It's not just frowned upon?
哦  嗯012---Oh. Ah. Ah!
我最喜欢住乔伊这012---I love it at Joey's.
继续012---There you go.
漂亮   谢谢012---Ooh. Thanks. Nice.

是你帮我争取到的012---You got me the audition?
来来  我们抱一抱012---Yeah. Oh, let's hug it up.
好了  好了012---Okay, okay, okay.
要是你入选的话  打算对我做个什么啊012---What are you gonna do to me if you get the part?
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
嗨  嗨012---Hi. Hi.
我有事要找你012---Yeah, okay, I need to talk to you. Uh-huh.
我知道他们说直发夹是起火源012---Now, I know that they said that the hair-straightener started the fire...
但我也有责任012---...but I think I'm partly at fault.
你看嘛   我没有告诉你   我最近刚刚换过厕纸012---You see, I didn't tell you, but, um, I had recently refilled the tissues.
所以  我们得正视这个问题   那个太容易着火了012---And so, you know, let's face it, that's just kindling.
我想我还是住乔伊家比较好012---So I think it's better that I stay at Joey's.
不  不  菲比  都是我不好012---No, no, no, Phoebe, this was my fault.
而且你知道吗   我在这里感觉太好了   好吧012---Besides, you know what? I'm fine here. Okay.
钱德   摩妮卡在找你   是嘛012---Oh, Chandler, Monica's looking for you. Really?
她好像说跟饼干屑有关   不会吧   我那么小心012---Yeah, she said something about crummies. No, no, no. I was so careful.
好  你一定要跟我换  摩妮卡快把我逼疯了012---Okay. You have to switch with me. Monica is driving me crazy.
没错  小姐们都想住乔伊家012---That's right. All the ladies wanna stay at Joey's.
不要  菲比  少来啊  我不想换012---No, Phoebe, come on, I don't wanna switch.
拜托啦   我在这里可以扔湿纸巾玩012---Please. Come on, I can throw wet paper towels here.
但是在摩妮卡那边   你只可能在水槽边吃饼干012---No, but at Monica's, you can eat cookies over the sink.
我知道  对不起012---I know. I'm sorry.
好吧   算了012---All right, fine.
这个好像很好玩012---This looks like so much fun. Ha, ha.
天呐  湿答答的012---God, what a mess.
校规里真的有写啊012---Wow, it actually is in the handbook.
我不能和你约会   或是在研究室用电磁炉012---I can't date you or have a hot plate in my office.
我们居然不能再见面了012---Oh, I can't believe we have to stop seeing each other.
不管值不值得   谢谢你为我挺身而出012---For what it's worth, I did appreciate you standing up for me.
这种感觉真好012---That felt really nice.
我更喜欢你了012---Kind of made me like you even more.
我知道  我也很喜欢你  但是我们不能再继续交往了012---I know, I know. I really like you too. But we can't date.
校规明文禁止师生恋012---It's against the rules. It's forbidden.
怎么了  光听你说校规 "禁止"012---What? Just hearing you describe it...
就觉得好冲动012---...as forbidden, it's really hot.
真的012---Really?
对啊012---Yeah.
不管有多冲动   这都是错的012---Well, I don't care how hot it is, it's, uh-it's wrong.
别再说了   不  不  这是错的012---Stop it. No, no. It's wrong. it's--
这不太合适012---It's naughty.
这是012---It's...
禁忌012---...taboo.
把书关上012---Shut the book.
要不  再去弄个电磁炉吧012---Hey. Let's also get a hot plate. Oh.
嘿   嘿012---Hey. Hey.
怎样啊  怎样012---So? So...?
今天是星期四   试镜结果如何012---It's Thursday. How was the audition? It's Thur--?
星期一  一天  星期二  二天   星期三三小  星期四012---Monday, one day. Tuesday, two day. Wednesday, when, huh, what day? Thur--
这玩意儿显然没用了012---Well, that thing's clearly in the way.
好吧  嗯哼012---All right. A-ha. Heh.
死冰箱012---Damn fridge!
嗨  乔伊  你好吗  很好啊012---Hi, Joey. How you doing? Great...
室友012---...roomie. Ah!
我们现在的确是室友  没错  你这么一提醒012---Yeah, I guess we are roommates now. Yeah! Well, now that you brought it up...
那个  我们的冰箱坏了  得买台新的012---...uh, our fridge is broken. We have to get a new one.
我打听过  你付一半400元   感激不尽012---Now, I checked around and your half is $400. Thanks a lot.
我才不付呢012---I'm not paying for half of that.
等我公寓修好了  我就搬回去了012---I'm only staying here until my apartment gets fixed.
瑞秋  这台冰箱是我出生之后  父母给买的012---Look, Rach, my parents bought this fridge just after I was born. Okay?
我用一直都没问题   你一来它就坏了012---Now, I have never had a problem with it. Then you show up and it breaks!
这说明什么012---What does that tell you?
说明冰箱不能和人一样长寿012---That refrigerators don't live as long as people?
好了  你也知道自动提款机一次只能提300元012---All right, now you know that the ATM only lets you take out 300 at a time...
剩下的100   我就收支票了012---...so I'll take a check for the other 100.
你在开玩笑   对吧012---Heh. You're joking, right?
那当然  我不收支票012---Of course I'm joking. I don't take checks.
幸好你还长的帅012---Thank God you're pretty.

我也得去012---...so I kind of have to go.
为什么募捐啊   不知道012---What's the charity? I don't know.
不是某种树   就是某种病012---Something, either trees or disease,
罗夫很会碎碎念012---Ralph mumbles a lot.
罗夫都趁你不专心时碎碎念吗   对呀   好奇怪012---Does Ralph mumble when you're not paying attention? Yeah. It's weird.
总之  我得找个男伴012---But the thing is, I need to find a date.
你想找什么样的人012---Well, What kind of guy are you looking for?
自己有晚礼服或租得起晚礼服012---Well, Someone that has his own tux or has the ability to rent a tux.
必须是男人  身家起码要有50元012---So he has to be a male who has at least $50.
噢  只差一点点012---Ooh, so close.
大家好   嗨012---Hey, everybody. Hey.
这是伊丽莎白  嗨012---Uh, this is Elizabeth. Hi, Elizabeth.
我就是那个学生012---I'm the student. Ha-ha-ha.
真可爱啊  才怪012---Isn't she cute?  No.
也许我不该多嘴   但你们不是不想在公共场所012---Y'know, this is probably none of my business, but weren't you guys supposed...
被别人看到在一起吗   我们没有在一起012---...to not be seen in public together? Oh, we're not together.
没有  我们只是  在咖啡馆012---No. We're just two people who happen to have run into each other...
巧遇的两个人而已012---...here at the coffee house. Heh, this is--
噢  真狡猾012---Oh, sly.
我真想好好认识你们   不过我该走了012---Well, I really wanted to meet you guys, but I have to run.
改天见  好012---I'll see you later? Okay.
罗斯  再见  再见012---Bye, Ross. Bye. See you.
我不是故意撞到你的  先生  没关系  女士012---Oops! I did not mean to run into you like that, sir. That is quite all right, ma'am.
拜012---Bye.
她干吗走了   要上晚自习还要去赶作业012---So why's she leaving? Is it a school night and she has a lot of homework to do?
对  她明天要交分子流行病学报告012---Yes. Her molecular epidemiology paper is due tomorrow.
帮我祝她好运012---Well, tell her "good luck" with that.
还有吗   别客气012---Anyone else, huh? Bring them on.
她什么时候生日   我不知道   瑞秋  干吗问呢012---Oh! When's her birthday? I don't know, Rachel. Why?
我好久没吃儿童生日餐了012---Well, you know it's just been so long since I've been to Chuck E. Cheese.
我喜欢伊丽莎白  谢谢012---I like Elizabeth. Well, thanks.
我真的很喜欢她   叫她今年早点送曲奇饼干来012---In fact, I like her so much that you tell her I want my cookies early this year.
要薄荷巧克力饼和巧克力派012---Y'know, A box of Thin Mints and some Tag-a-longs.
你们别整他了  说真的  你们交往得怎样012---Hey-hey come on you guys, give him a break. Ross, seriously, how's it going with her?
非常好啊012---Well, actually it's been great.
她才20岁   还不想太认真012---She's 20, so she's not looking for anything too serious...
最适合现在的我012---...which is perfect for me right now.
太好了  她真的好像很不错012---Well, that is great. And seriously, she seems very nice.
谢谢   我知道你们喜欢涮我012---Thanks. I know you guys like to give me a hard time and all,
但我真的希望你们能喜欢她012---...but it really means a lot to me that you like her.
只要知道你们  我想到一个很棒的012---Just knowing that you guys are, like. Okay, I got a good one.
好012---Okay, um-Heh.
她是才12岁吗012---What is she, like, 12?
钱德   你觉得我们的沟通够吗012---Chandler, do you think we talk about our relationship enough?
够了  有水果卷吗012---Yeah. Do we have any Fruit Roll Ups?
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
好  我刚想到一个人  很适合当瑞秋的男伴012---Okay, I just thought of the perfect guy for Rachel to take to her thing.
有意思  我们也找到人了012---Oh that's so funny, we found someone too.
那好  她可以在我的人和你们的怪胎之中选一个012---Oh that's good. I guess she'll have a choice between my guy and your weirdo.
为什么我们的人是怪胎   因为你们的品味012---Why would our guy be a weirdo? Because that's just your taste.
瑞秋才不会选你的蠢人012---See, Rachel's not gonna pick your stupid guy.
是吗  没错012---Oh, yeah? Yeah.
我这个是一个做义工的律师012---My guy is a lawyer who does volunteer work.
而且他有这个东西012---And he has one of these.
脸屁股012---A face ass?
下巴窝啦   我们的这个是钱德的同事012---A chin dimple. Well, uh, our guy works with Chandler.
他人好  聪明  又会打扮012---And he's really nice and smart and he's a great dresser.
你们看过他的身体吗  没有  他是一颗飘来飘去的头012---Have you seen your guy's body? No. Our guy's just a floating head.
我这个身材很赞   他是我的按摩客人012---Well, my guy is spectacular, okay? He's a massage client.
有一次他在按摩台上  就被我看个精光光的012---And one time, um, when he was on the table, I looked at it. And I mean, all of it.
你不是不能偷看吗   报警啊   来抓我啊012---You're not supposed to look. Yeah, like there are police for that.
等等  你也给我按摩过  你会偷看  没错012---Wait! you look? You massaged me. I know.
好  你那个或许有好身材  但我们这个012---All right, your guy may have a great body, but our guy...
相当幽默   钱德式的幽默012---is really funny. Chandler funny?
我们这个舞功高强   我这个饱读诗书012---Our guy's a great dancer. My guy's well-read.
我们这个一头靓发   我这个两排洁牙012---Our guy has great hair. My guy has great teeth.
我们这个香的不得了012---Our guys smells incredible.
我们说的是一个人吗012---Do you want our guy to be your guy?
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
你的脸色不太好   乔伊012---Well, you don't look good, Joe.
冰箱坏了  我得把里面的东西都吃掉012---Well, the fridge broke, so I had to eat everything.
冷盘  冰淇淋  橙汁012---Cold cuts, ice cream, limes.
嘿   咖啡色罐子里装的是什么012---Hey, what was in that brown jar?
那个还在  已经不在了012---That's still in there? Not anymore.
那么  你准备付我多少钱012---Ahem, so, anyway, how do you want to pay me?
你要提供某种服务吗012---Is this a service you're providing me?
不是  是我要买新冰箱   我们的新冰箱012---No, for my new fridge. For our new fridge.
我们的新冰箱012---Our new fridge?
我都不在这里住了   那又怎样012---I don't live here anymore. So what?
假设我们是离婚的夫妻012---Look, okay, suppose we were a, uh, divorced couple.
我取得了孩子的监护权012---Uh-huh. And I got custody of the kid. Right?
结果孩子死了  我总得买个新孩子012---Now, suppose the kid dies and I gotta buy a new kid.
好012---0Kay.
给我400元012---Give me $400!
盖勒教授012---Professor Geller? Hmm?
喔   一名我不认识的学生012---Oh, a student I don't know.
我想问下   能不能跟您谈一会儿012---I was wondering if I could talk to you for a moment?
当然可以  是哪方面的事012---Yes, of course. What would this be regarding?
在你的研究室亲热一下  好012---Making out in your office. Wh-Shh!

抱歉012---Sorry. Ha-ha-ha.
我真的有事要讲   好  什么事012---Um, I actually do need to talk to you. Oh. Okay, what about?
春游   春游012---Spring vacation. Spring vacation?
对   学校没课  很多人要出去旅行012---Yeah, we have time off, and a lot of people are going on trips--
盖勒教授  是  菲森死盯个乐教授012---Professor Geller. Yes, Professor Fiesenstinlender?
等我一分钟  我马上就好012---I'll be with you in one moment.
那我就买一盒薄荷巧克力饼012---So I will take one box of the Thin Mints.
你们不懂   伊丽莎白想找我跟她去旅行012---You don't understand. Elizabeth was about to ask me to go on a trip with her.
你这样叫慢慢来吗   我还没准备好012---Is that taking it slow? I'm not ready for this, okay?
我该怎么说   实话实说  说你还没准备好012---What do I tell her? Tell her the truth. You're not ready.
我可以试试012---I could do that.
要是她不高兴呢   你就拿芭比娃娃逗她012---Well, what if she gets upset? Then you distract her with a Barbie doll.
或者012---Or...
你也可以  你知道的012---...you could just, you know, you...
你这是在干什么012---What the hell are you doing?
什么012---What?
我干什么  你刚弄坏了我的冰箱012---What the hell am I doing? You just broke my fridge!
什么  你怎么知道它坏了012---What? How do you know if-How do you know it's even broken?
它怎么坏的我会不知道吗012---Oh, you think I don't know what breaks my fridge?
等一下012---Excuse me.
看嘛   坏了012---Well, what do you know? Broken!
要赔400元012---That'll be $400.
乔伊  我看见你推他了012---Joey, I saw you push him.
是你推的012---You pushed him.
乔伊  我没把它弄坏  它早就坏了012---Joey, I did not break this. Okay? That has been broken for a while.
钱德   记不记得我提过这是我们的冰箱012---All right. Chandler, do you remember how I told you about our fridge? Uh-huh.
我到现在还没收到你那一半钱012---I still haven't gotten the check for your half yet.
不要给他钱012---Do not give him any money.
你少插嘴   弄坏冰箱的家伙012---I'm not talking to you! You broke my fridge!
盖勒教授   你找我  是的  请进012---You wanted to see me, Professor Geller? Yes. Yes. Please come in.
噢  哦012---Mm, ooh, ooh.
门把手  对  有点玩上瘾了012---Doorknob? Yeah. It kind of grows on you.
事实上  我想和你谈谈春游的事012---Actually, I wanted to finish talking to you about spring vacation.
喔   好012---Oh, good.
听着  我012---Look, L...
我跟你在一起很开心012---Look, I've been having a great time with you.
我不想进展得太快   那样会给大家压力012---And I just don't want us to move too fast or put too much pressure on us.
所以很抱歉   我们还不能一起出去旅行012---So I'm sorry, I just don't think we should go away together yet.
那样太快了012---It's too soon.
罗斯  你误会我的意思了012---Uh, Ross, I think you misunderstood what I was saying.
我只是想告诉你   我要去佛罗里达州两星期012---I just wanted to tell you that I'm going to Florida for a couple weeks.
不012---No.
是你误会我的意思了012---I think you misunderstood what I was saying.
我的意思是  你真的好可爱012---What I meant was... You are so adorable.
这个  我们来谈谈可爱吧012---That. Let's talk about that.
嘿   嘿012---Hey. Hey.
和伊丽莎白谈得怎么样了  喔012---How did it go with Elizabeth? Huh? Oh, oh.
没事  只是一场误会  她不是要我一起去012---it was fine. It was just a misunderstanding. She didn't want me to go with her.
她只是要告诉我   她准备去佛州春游012---She just wanted to let me know that she's going to Florida for spring vacation.
等等   她是去春游  还是去度春假012---Wait, is she going for spring vacation or going for spring break.
有什么差别吗012---What's the difference?
春游就是跟爷爷奶奶一起共享天伦012---A spring vacation, you're doing nice things with your grandparents.
春假嘛   就是跟兄弟会的人上床012---Spring break, you're doing frat guys.
不是每个人的春假都那样012---Hey, you know what? Not all spring breaks are like that.
那你是怎么过的   我跟我爸去了埃及012---What did you do on yours? I went to Egypt with my dad.
我能想像   "看  爸爸  狮身人面像"012---I can see it now. "Look, Dad, it's the Sphinx."
我想伊丽莎白那么正经   不会去"春假"012---I think Elizabeth is a little more serious than, "Spring break!"
好吗   她修了我的课012---All right? Come on, she's taking my class.
还跟教授上床   我给她打电话012---And slept with the professor. I'm gonna call her.
各位  这是塞巴斯蒂012---Hey, you guys, I want you to meet Sebastian.
我们刚刚012---Hi. We just, uh--
在报摊认识   我们同时抓起了一本《原野与河流》012---We just met at the newsstand. We both grabbed for the last Field and Stream. Ha!
呃   我读过012---What, I read that.
我去给你拿杯咖啡   好啊   谢谢012---Can I get you a cup of coffee? Oh, yes. Thank you.
瑞秋  你这是什么意思  什么012---Rachel, what the hell is this? What?
你叫我们帮你找男伴   却自己带了个人来012---You ask us to find you a guy, and then you come in here with a guy of your own.
你们帮我找到人了  对012---You found me a guy? Yes.
在钱德的公司  看中了一个可爱风趣的人012---We found you a really cute, funny guy from Chandler's work.
我也找了一个   至少不是怪人012---Yeah, and I found you one, too, who is not a weirdo.
我真的很感激你们012---You know what though, guys, I really appreciate that...
不过我还是带塞巴斯蒂一起去舞会好了012---...but I'm just gonna take Sebastian to the charity.
你确定   我们的这个浑身异香012---Are you sure? Because our guy smells incredible.
别再提那个了好吗012---Would you stop it with that already?
你的咖啡   谢谢012---Here you go. Sure. Oh, thank you.
塞巴斯蒂   你是义工吗012---So, Sebastian, do you do any volunteer work?
不是  怎么了  没事012---Uh, no, not really. Why? No reason.
只是我认识一个   关心别人的单身好男人012---It's just I know a single guy who does care about other people.
你风趣吗012---Are you funny?
什么  你们这是在干吗012---Excuse me? What are you guys doing?
你风趣吗   讲个笑话来听听012---Are you funny? Tell us a joke!
我只是想和瑞秋喝杯咖啡012---Look, I just wanted to have coffee with Rachel.
是啊   很多人都想012---Well, so do a lot of people.
说实话   我想我该走了012---Actually, uh, I gotta get going. Oh, but you--
有空打电话   不过你没给我电话号码012---Give me a call sometime. But you didn't give me your number.
那好  改天见012---Okay, see you later.
原来他蛮风趣的012---Turns out he is kind of funny.
我简直不能相信012---I cannot believe you guys!
他这么好   就这样被你们赶走了012---He was really nice and he just left because of you!
"塞巴斯蒂"   听起来像猫的名字012---Yeah, but, "Sebastian"? What is that, a cat's name?
你知道我发现了什么   瑞秋  他很胆小012---You know what I noticed, Rachel, he scares easy.
你难道带这样的人去舞会012---Now, is that the kind of guy you want to take to a ball?
"塞巴斯蒂   要不要跳舞"012---"Sebastian, would you like to dance?"
"好  我得走了"012---"Uh, okay. I gotta go. Aah!"
够了  别说了   瑞秋  对不起012---All right, guys stop it. Rachel, we're very sorry.
我们太过分了012---That is a very insensitive thing for us to do.
这样吧  让我们补偿你   我们有两个好男人让你挑012---You know what? Let us make it up to you. We've two really great guys for you.
对啊   你有什么损失012---Yeah, what have you got to lose?
如果你选我这边的人   搞不好会认识让你心动的人012---Y'know you might even end up with someone really special. If you pick my guy.
好吧  好   你愿意见我们找的人012---All right. Okay. So you will meet our guys?
是啊   我愿意012---Yes, I'll meet them.
你选谁都行   你自己决定012---It doesn't matter which one you choose. y'know? It's completely up to you.
我们这个才叫完美012---Our guy is perfect.
或者你也可以选012---Or you could go out with the guy Phoebe deemed...
菲比看不上眼的人012---...not good enough to go outwith herself. Ugh!
菲比  你在这儿   你弄坏我的冰箱012---Phoebe, there you are! Okay, you broke my fridge.
欠我400元012---You owe me 400 bucks.
好吧  真的012---Okay, sure. Really?
技术上来说   你欠我600元   你最近十次的试镜012---Ooh, technically, you owe me $600 for sending out happy thoughts...
我都有给你祝福012---...on your last 10 auditions.

回来了  伊丽莎白怎么说012---There you are. So, what did Elizabeth say?
她真的是要去德通纳  渡"春假  呼呼"012---Well, turns out she is going to Daytona for "spring break, woo-hoo."
那就有湿衫美女大赛   男生会向女生身上射水012---That means wet T-shirt contests, guys doing shots off of girls' bodies...
第二天醒来甚至不知道一起睡的是谁012---...waking up next to people you don't even know.
看来  她会玩得很爽了012---Man, she is gonna have a great time!
她要住可乐娜酒店吗012---Is she staying at the Hotel Corona?
你熟悉那酒店  当然  我参加过81年春假  呼呼012---You know the hotels? Sure! I was there, Spring Break '81! Woo-hoo!

那又怎样  我开车过去  卖了T恤  玩得好开心012---So what? I drove down, sold T-shirts. I had a blast.
你们知道谁最会疯   醉酒的女大学生012---And y'know who knows how to party? Drunk college chicks.
知道了  她不能去012---Okay, she can't go.
罗斯  你不能阻止她去  你们这才交往多久啊012---Ross, You can't tell her not to go. You just started dating.
那我该怎么办  不怎么办   你只能冷处理哦012---Then what am I supposed to do? Nothing. Just be cool with it.
要是她跑去跟一堆人上床呢012---What if she goes down there and sleeps with a bunch of guys?
那这次   你就别娶她了012---Well, maybe you don't marry this one.
我真为你能去旅行而高兴012---I'm so glad you're going on this trip.
就是啊   我这学期这么用功012---Yeah, I've been working so hard this semester.
真的需要疯狂一下   好好缓解下压力012---I really need to go crazy, you know? Blow off some steam.
当然   当然需要了012---Sure. Sure.
我不知道你的计划到底定了没有012---Look, I don't know if your plans are finalized yet...
但我知道  还有一个办法可以缓解压力012---...but I know another great way to blow off steam.
什么办法  你喜欢做手工艺吗012---What? Are you into crafts at all?
罗斯  你还好吗  我当然很好012---Ross, are you okay? Uh, yeah. Of course I'm okay.
我只是在表示  支持012---Heh, I'm just being, uh, supportive.
支持你和你的旅行012---Supportive of you and this whole trip...
还有   这是这是什么012---...and what-What is, uh--? What's this?
是泳衣啊   你要穿着它去见人012---It's a bathing suit? To wear in front of people?
你这样算支持吗   这样是吗012---Is that supportive? Is this?
嘿  太好了012---Hey. Good, good, good.

我明晚不加班   明晚不错012---I don't work late tomorrow night. Tomorrow night is good.
不过  现在能做的事  为什么要拖到明天012---but uh, y'know what? why put off something till tomorrow that you can do right now. Ha-ha-ha.

嗨  嗨012---Hi. Hi.
你来晚了  她跟我们那个在一起了012---Okay, you're too late okay? because she's already with our guy.
天哪  对啊  我是来晚了  他们正坐在沙发上聊天呢012---Oh, my God, you're right, I am too late. They're sitting on the couch and talking.

懂了012---0Kay.
但是菲比  什么  你们这样让我好为难012---But Pheebs, Yeah? I'm just sort of in the middle of something.
没事的   没关系   你坐过来012---Oh, okay. That's okay. Have a seat.
你不能这样   也许我得走了012---You can't do that! Maybe I should go.
你坐下   我们赢定了012---Just sit down, we're winning.
好吧  也许我该走了012---Okay, you know what? Maybe I should go.
不  不要  你也给我坐下  坐下012---No, no! Have a Seat! Have a seat!
瑞秋  你还没摸过艾达的头发012---Rachel, Rachel, you haven't touched Eldad's hair.
超柔顺的  你摸摸看  不必了012---It is the softest hair. Touch it. Yeah, I'm good.
瑞秋  派屈克很有钱   拿钱砸她012---Rachel, Patrick is really rich. Give her some money.
菲比   这个免费按摩的代价太高了012---Y'know what Phoebe? this isn't really worth the free massage.
没错   派屈克   再见012---That's right, Patrick. Bye-bye.
艾达绝对是个好舞伴012---Eldad is much more cooperative and he can dance.
跳个舞给瑞秋看看012---You dance for Rachel.
不   拜托   别跳了012---No-no! don't dance for me, please! Don't!
你们这是怎么搞的012---What is the matter with you guys'?

该尴尬的是你们  这真是可笑012---I'll tell you who should be embarrassed. It's you guys. Come on! This is ridiculous!
谢谢你们   但我不需要你们给我安排约会012---Thank you very much, but I do not need you to get me a date.
那你为什么叫我们  我还没说完012---Then why did she ask us to help-I am still talking!
你们还把我真正喜欢的人赶走012---Then you chase away the one guy that I actually liked.
我没有冒犯的意思  真的  恭喜你012---I mean, no offense to you guys. Really, congratulations on...
你那么有钱012---...all the cash.
还有你   哇   你的头发真柔顺012---And you really-Wow, you do have very soft hair.
但我更愿意跟我自己选择的人参加晚会012---But I'd much rather go to the ball all by myself than go through any more of this!
再见012---Good bye.
你用什么特别的润发露吗012---Now, do you use some sort of special conditioner on that hair?
有  木瓜粹取液  谢谢012---Yes, papaya extract. Thank you.

你带那套泳衣了吗   带了012---Did you pack that bathing suit? Yeah.
我刚才把它藏起来了   蛮好玩的012---It was pretty funny when I hid it for a while, huh?
总之012---Anyway. Um...
我还是担心那套泳装012---I am worried about that bathing suit.
倒不是因为太暴露   那个呢我不在意012---Not because it's revealing, which I'm fine with.
对  我是关心你的健康012---No, I'm concerned about your health.
怕你晒到012---Um, sun exposure.
放心  我带了一大堆防晒油012---Oh, don't worry, I have plenty of sun block.
防晒系数达到30   好吧012---It's SPF 30. All right.
如果里面装的真能到30就好了012---Well, if what's in the bottle is actually 30.
有时候买的是30   里面只能达到4   我发誓012---I mean, sometimes you get 30, sometimes it's 4, and I swear...
有很多  都只是牛奶而已012---...more often than not, it's just milk.
罗斯  你放心012---Ross, it's gonna be okay.
我不是要去跟一堆男生鬼混012---I'm not going down there to hook up with a bunch of guys.
我真的很喜欢你  我珍惜我们的关系012---I really like you. I like how things are going between us.
真的  对啊012---Really? Yeah.

对  你跟个石头似的  你不如我012---Yeah, you're solid. You're just no me.
我看就先这样吧012---You know what? I think that's enough for now.
我不想排练过头012---I don't want to be over-rehearsed. Ha-ha-ha.
没关系   我一个人自己演012---Fine. I'll do it without you!
没你或其它人  我照样演012---I don't need you or anybody else!

就像你一下要背很多台词012---It's like, you got so many lines to learn so fast...
有时得停下来想下一句012---...that sometimes you need a minute to remember your next one.
在你想的时候  要来个大停顿  表情专注故作严肃012---So while you're thinking of it, you take this big pause where you look all intense.

其实很顺利吧012---...but it really did go well?
对  你们上过当了吗  完全被骗了012---Yeah, did I fool you? Totally!
所以  一切很顺利   顺利的不得了012---So, it did go well? It went amazingly well!

很抱歉   但你们所面临的和我不一样012---I mean no offense, but what you guys all do is very different.
我不知道你们能不能体会012---I don't know if you'd understand.
是啊  我们的工作都没有压力012---Yeah, none of the rest of us have to deal with pressure at our jobs.
是的  我知道现在几点了012---Yes, I know what time it is...

这个角色能扭转我的整个演艺生涯012---This part could've turned my whole career around.
是我的错  对不起  我真的搞砸了012---I messed up, okay? I'm sorry. I really messed up.
你都已经不住在这里了  干嘛要接听我的电话012---You don't even live here anymore. Why'd you answer my phone?
我可以录音的  是我买给你的012---I have a machine! Which I bought for you.
还教你怎么用   你还以为它是复印机012---Taught you how to use it. You thought it was a copier.
我愿意尽全力挽救这个错误   我一定会做  知道吗012---If there was anything I could do, I would do it, okay?
但是人起码可以犯一次错错  不是吗012---But everybody's allowed one mistake, right?
他可以送我录影机  或是一对高尔夫球杆012---He could have gotten me a VCR. He could have gotten me golf clubs.
可是  他偏偏要送我这个  吓跑女人012---But no, he has to get me the woman repeller.
看着碍眼  戴着碍事儿的东西012---The eyesore from the Liberace House of Crap!
没那么严重啦  你当然说得容易了012---it's not that bad. Oh, yeah, easy for you to say.
你又不必戴着  被某个老粗淘汰的金饰到处跑012---You don't have to walk around sporting some reject from the Mr. T Collection.
钱德  钱德012---Chandler. Chandler.
我真同情戴这个手饰的人  真的012---I pity the fool who puts on my jewelry! I do! I do!
我真同情戴这个  你好012---I pity the fool that--
嘿012---Hi.
你昨晚迟到后   凯西和我聊了起来  然后012---When you were late last night, Kathy and I got to talking and...
事情演变到后来就012---...one thing led to another and...
就什么  你跟她上床012---And what? Did you sleep with her?
没有  我只是吻了她  什么  那更糟012---No! No, I just kissed her. What? That's even worse!
怎么会更糟   我不知道  反正都一样012---How is that worse? I don't know! But it's the same!
你说得对  我无话可说  我太过分了012---You're right, I have no excuses. I was totally over the line.
"过分"012---"Over the line?"
你根本就过分到  连过分见到你012---You're so far past the line that you can't even see the line!
都会说你过分012---Yeah, the line is a dot to you!
我不奢望你马上原谅我012---Look, I'm not saying that you should magically forgive me.
但你也不完美   你也做过错误的判断012---But you're not perfect. You've made some errors in judgment too.
举个例子012---Name one.
怎么回事012---What happened?
他答应不拿沙发椅的012---Aw, man! He promised he wouldn't take the chairs!
怎么回事   你怎么会被关进去呢012---What the hell happened? How were you locked in?
我们的东西呢012---And where the hell's all of our stuff?
有一个人过来看柜子012---Well, this guy came by to look at the unit...
他说他不相信能塞下一个大人012---...and he said he didn't think big enough to fit a grown man.
所以  你就自愿进去012---So you got in voluntarily?
我想把柜子卖出去嘛012---I was trying to make a sale!
要是让我碰上他  你猜我会怎样012---Oh, man, if I ever run into that guy again, you know what I'm gonna do?
把屁股翘起来012---Bend over?
她来了012---There's Lorraine.
记住  不准交换  美女是你的  失恋女是我的012---Okay, now remember, no trading. You get the pretty one, I get the mess.
嗨  乔伊  嘿012---Hi, Joey. Hey.
他就是你带来的人012---Well, well. Look what you brought.
你又带谁来了012---And what did you bring?
她在寄放外套012---She's checking her coat.
乔伊   我要去洗个手012---Joey, I'm gonna go wash the cab smell off my hands.
你帮我叫一杯白酒   帮珍妮丝叫一杯红酒012---Will you get me a white Zinfandel and a glass of red for Janice?
珍妮丝012---Janice?
珍妮丝012---Janice?
我的天哪012---Oh, my God!
乔伊的栽缝吃我豆腐012---Joey's tailor took advantage of me.
什么012---What?
不可能   我找他做了12年衣服012---No way. I've been going to the guy for 12 years.
拜托啦   他说要量裤管内侧012---He said he was gonna do my inseam...
然后他的手一路摸上来   然后就012---...then he ran his hand up my leg and then there was definite...
怎样012---What?
包住了012---Cupping.
裤子就是那样量的012---That's how they do pants!
罗斯  你告诉他012---Ross, will you tell him?
裤子不都是那样量的  是啊  是啊  在监狱里012---Isn't that how a tailor measures pants? Yes, yes, it is. In prison!
叫你举一个就好012---I said name one!
我居然这么粗心  我真白痴  别再自责了012---I can't believe I did this. What an idiot. Stop beating yourself up.
人都会犯错   这是难免的012---People make mistakes. These things happen.
你没有忘记帮我记留言吧012---There aren't any messages you've forgotten to give me, are there?
显然  你不太会记留言012---Apparently, you're not very good at it.
你们觉得他会原谅我吗  当然会012---Do you think he'll ever forgive me? Of course he will.
钱德  但最重要的是  你得原谅自己012---Chandler, the most important thing is that you forgive yourself.
其实我已经原谅自己了  这么快012---You know what, I kind of have. Already?
你犯的错蛮严重的012---That was pretty bad, what you did.
你知道吗  他会原谅你的012---You know what? He will forgive you.
我接电话时都会带便条纸  以防万一  好啦012---And I like to bring a pad with me when I go answer the phone, just in case. Okay.
你没看到他气成什么样子012---You didn't see how mad he was, you know?
他一定会原谅你的012---I'm sure he will forgive you.
我们都有这种经验  吵架  和解012---Look, we've all been there, you know? You fight, you make up.
就是这样012---That's the way it works.
感情破裂  往往是两个人的错012---It took two people to break up this relationship!
对  你和复印店那个女的012---Yeah! You and that girl from the copy place...
你昨天表明愿意负责012---...which yesterday you took full responsibility for!
我不知道我负的是什么责012---I didn't know what I was taking responsibility for, okay?
我没把信看完012---I didn't finish the whole letter.
什么   我睡着了012---What? I fell asleep.
你睡着了012---You fell asleep?
当时是早上5点半012---It was 5:30 in the morning.
你一废话就废话了十八页012---And you had rambled on for 18 pages.
正反面都写满了012---Front and back!
还有 "你得"是指 "你必须"012---And by the way? Y-O-U, apostrophe R-E means, "you are."
"你的"是所有格012---Y-O-U-R means "your."
我居然想要跟你复合012---Y'know I can't believe I thought of getting back together with you.
我们根本就完了012---We are so over!
无所谓012---Fine by me!
顺便告诉你   那种事并不常见012---And hey! just so you know, it's not that common...
不是男人都会那样   没有什么大不了的012---...it doesn't happen to every guy, and it is a big deal!
我就知道012---I knew it!
你没有权利和他约会   这真是太荒谬了012---You had no right to go out with him. That is the most ridiculous--
你出卖了我   我没有出卖你012---You sold me out! I did not sell you out!
不  你出卖了  你当然出卖了我   你还让我说话吗012---Yes, you did! You absolutely sold me-Would you let me talk?
你弹了我的额头吗012---Did you just flick me?
你不让我说完   我只是想  我很012---Okay, well, you wouldn't let me finish and I was just-Ow!
够了  够了012---Stop it! Ow! Ow!
住手  住手012---stop. Stop.
好  不要这样  不要啊012---All right. No, let's not do this. No!
想想快乐的事   不012---Happy thoughts. No!
别打了012---Stop it! Oh! Oh!
好了   我就要踢屁股了012---Okay, now I'm gonna kick some ass!
痛  痛  我知道012---Ow. Ow. Ow. I know, I know.
好  你们住手  我就放手012---All right. Now, I will let go if you both stop.
好吧  好吧012---Fine. Fine.
这样多好012---There we go.
你知道吗   如果在监狱  你们就是我的喽罗了012---Ha. You know what? If we were in prison, you guys would be like my bitches.
好吗   兄弟   你瞧瞧怎么样012---Okay, buddy boy, here it is.
你敢藏我的衣服    我就把你衣服都穿上012---You hide my clothes? I'm wearing everything you own.
我的天哪012---Oh, my God!
看啊  我是钱德   我还能再多穿点衣服吗012---Look at me, I'm Chandler! Could I be wearing any more clothes?
或许我要去玩野战游戏012---Maybe if I wasn't going "commando."
穿这么多衣服真热   我最好别蹲什么弓箭步012---Yeah. Whew, it's hot with all of this stuff on. I better not do any, I don't know, lunges. 
乔伊012---Joey?

喂012---Hello?
乔伊现在不在   我可以帮你留言吧012---No, Joey's not here right now, but I can take a message. I think.
他还有机会得到那个角色   真是个好消息012---He's still got a chance for the part? Oh, That's great news!
很明显不是因为  那位被狗咬伤的演员而幸灾乐祸012---Well, no, obviously not for the actor who was mauled by his dog.
太好了  我会转告乔伊   谢谢012---Oh well, that's great. I will give Joey the message. Thank you.

这时候在这里遇见罗斯  真怪啊012---It is so strange seeing Ross here, this time of day...
通常他都要在儿童医院012---...because usually he's at the children's hospital.
对   都没有约会012---Yeah. But not looking for dates.
摩妮卡是罗斯的妹妹012---So, um, Monica is Ross' sister.
他是个了不起的大哥012---He's a great brother!
我也有个妹妹012---I had a sister. Oh.
她过世了   哦012---She passed away. Oh...
你们不用每次都表示同情012---You don't have to do that every time.
不过  罗斯人真的很好  我们是大学室友012---But, uh, Ross is a great guy. I was roommates with him in college.
相当的有趣012---Funny story, heh, ha, ha...
你的大学室友一定死了  对吧012---Your roommate in college died, didn't he?
他算是半死不活  对012---A part of him did, yes.
来吧   保罗  伊丽莎白012---Okay! Here we are, Paul, Elizabeth.
希望你们能找到愉快的话题012---I hope you guys were finding something to talk about.
我们正在愉快   抱歉  我来晚了012---Yes. We were just-Sorry I'm late.
不过我已经准备好了  帮你美言几句012---But I am ready, ready to talk you up. Heh.
丽莎的爸爸什么时候来   我已经到了012---When does Liz's father get here? I'm already here.
罗斯人最好了012---Oh, Ross is so great.
甜心  你买了印着小女生的这种  不是说好买印着婴儿的那种吗012---Honey, you got the kind with the little girl. You said we'd get the kind with the baby.
你说的那个婴儿的让你害怕   不  是小女生的才恐怖012---You said the baby creeps you out. No, The little girl creeps me out.
你是说婴儿的  婴儿的为什么会让我害怕012---You said the baby. Why would the baby creep me out?
那小女生有什么好怕的012---Why would the little girl creep you out?
抱歉  你们讲慢点好吗012---I'm sorry. Can you please talk a little slower.
你要写进书里  对  这是探讨两性关系的书012---This is going in your book? Yeah, It's about relationships.
尔虞我诈  各种禁忌012---You know, the traps, the pitfalls, what not to do.
接着说   太精彩了  什么012---Keep going. This stuffs great. What?
再说一遍012---Excuse me.
还有就是  真爱无敌012---And how none of it matters when the people really love each other.
还有   人人都喜欢听好话012---And how people will believe anything you tell them as long as it's a compliment.
喔   嗨   嗨012---Oh, hi! Hi. Hi. Hi.
我的钥匙掉在这里什么地方了  那赶快找啊012---I left my keys here somewhere. Oh, well, let's look for them.
在这里  嘿012---Under here-Oh, hey!
嘿  是这串吗012---Hey! Are these them?
不是012---No.
好吧012---All right. Oh.
是这串  太好了012---Here they are. Good.
多谢帮忙   等等012---Thanks for your help. Wait! Sorry!
保罗先生   叫我保罗就好012---Mr. Paul? Just call me Paul.
保罗  我只是想说012---Paul. Um, I just wanted you to know that...
罗斯人真的很好012---...you know, Ross really is a great guy.
不如你跟他交往   省得我宰了他012---Maybe you could date him then. it would save me the trouble of killing him.
你没事吧012---Are you okay?
你不像是个有20岁女儿的人012---You just don't look old enough to have a 20-year-old daughter.
我们生她的时候很年轻012---Well, we were very young when we had her.
我们  对啊   通常一男一女才能生孩子啊012---Ah. We? Yeah, it usually takes two people to...
当然是  两个人才能生孩子  我知道012---Oh, no! Yes! Of course. I know that.
我是问  现在是"我们"   还是只剩下你单身012---What I meant was are you still "we" or are you just you?
只有我  单身012---I'm just me. Yeah.
丽莎出生没多久   我老婆就死了012---My wife died shortly after Lizzie was born.
喔012---Oh.
你一手把她带大  对  没错012---So you raised her all on your own? Yes, I did.
哦012---Oh...
嘿   嘿012---Hey. Hey.
第一天顺利吗   还不错012---How was your first day? Great.
只是机器人有点闹别扭012---Except I got a little attitude from the robot.
该死的机器人   它们本该是人类忠实的仆人012---Damn those robots. They're supposed to be our faithful servants!
也不是机器人的问题   是操纵他的家伙012---It wasn't the robot, it was the guy who controls him.
他不喜欢我   我正要去拿三明治012---He doesn't like me. He had C.H.E.E.S.E. knock over the sandwich table...
他却操纵吉事  打翻了餐桌012---...right when I was reaching for one. Ugh.
你为啥不解雇了他012---Why don't you get him fired?
搞不好我会  我也不想这样  但我是个明星012---I may have to. I hate to do it. But I'm the star, you know?
总不能老捡地上的三明治来吃吧012---There's a limit to how many sandwiches I can eat off the floor.
抱歉012---Excuse me.
乔伊崔比亚尼012---Joey Tribbiani.
小子  总算找到你了  我帮你联系了一个试镜012---Joe! I'm glad I found you! I got an audition for you.
哇   不过这事还没公开012---Wow. The thing is, it's kind of on the q.t.
那个演员不知道   他可能会被换掉012---The actor who has the part doesn't know he might be fired.
是一部连续剧的主角012---It's the lead in a series.
麦克与吉事012---Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.
我就是《麦克与吉事》的主角012---I'm the lead in Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.
哦012---Uh-oh.
乔伊012---Joey?
嗨  罗斯012---Hi, Ross.
我只想让他更喜欢你012---I was just getting him to like you.
乔伊012---Joey?
乔伊  嘿  罗斯012---Joey! Hey, Ross.
罗斯  乔伊不在012---Ross, Joey is not here.
那好   我就在这儿等等他012---Okay, I'll just wait for him in here!
罗斯   没关系   你可以出来012---Ross, it's okay. You can come out.
罗斯  没关系  是我啊012---Yeah, Ross. It's okay. It's me...
史提芬斯先生012---...Mr. Stevens.
哦  天哪   我刚才没看见你012---Oh, I didn't... Oh, my gosh. I didn't even see you.
你肯定看见了  你走进来  表情古怪  然后就跑进了卧房012---Sure you did. You came in, got all awkward and ran to the bedroom.
还一直喊   "乔伊  乔伊"012---You were shouting, "Joey, Joey!"
再见  瑞秋  再见012---Bye, Rachel. Bye.
我会再打给你  好  再见012---I'll call you later. Okay. See you!
罗斯  再见012---Bye, Ross. Ah, hoo. Ha, ha.
你在   你怎么了  你在怎么012---What-what-what the—how da-how did-what the-how did-what?!
他的钥匙掉了  到处在找012---Well, You know, he lost his keys. So he was looking for them.
在你的嘴里找012---In your mouth?
不012---No.
在楼下找  我们聊了2小时012---Downstairs. And we got to talking...
我很喜欢他  就请他上来喝杯咖啡012---...for two hours. I really liked him. I invited him for a cup of coffee.
你们就在咖啡厅里012---You were at the coffee house!
罗斯  就算我亲了他  这有什么大不了的012---Ross, what's the big deal? So I kissed the guy.
他是我女朋友的爸爸   这样子很怪012---He's my girlfriend's father. Okay? It's weird!
你还跟我妹约会呢   那不一样012---You dated my sister. That was different!
什么  有什么不一样  我觉得怪012---What? Why? This is weird for me!
罗斯  听好  这样对你有好处012---Ross, look. look this is good for you, okay?
承认吧  目前保罗一点也不喜欢你012---Let's face it. So far the guy's not loving you.
但我可以改变他的看法   我有门路012---But I can turn that around. I've got the inside track.
我们可以一起出去吃饭   我替你美言012---We could all go out to dinner. y'know? And I could talk you up.
况且他是个超有名的律师012---Plus the guy is a very, very successful lawyer.
很重要吗   绝对重要012---How is that important? Oh, it's important.
很明显  能扮演麦克的人多如牛毛012---Apparently, there's a million guys out there that can play Mac ...
机器人只有一个012---...and there's only one robot.
能控制他的人更是独一无二   没想到他竟有生杀大权012---And this one guy who controls it. I didn't know he could get me fired.
我该怎么办  乔伊012---What am I gonna do? Well, Joey.
你是一个魅力男012---You're a pretty charming guy.
谢了  但我现在面临困难012---Thanks. But I have a problem to deal with.
宝贝  你得征服那个操作员012---No, sweetie. You've got to win over the guy who controls C.H.E.E.S.E.
还得用力拍机器人的马屁012---Go back there and kiss some serious robot ass!
好主意012---That's not a bad idea!
既然明天要施展魅力  今天就不跟你们这伙人浪费了012---If I have to turn on the charm tomorrow, I'm not wasting any of it on you guys.
不过菲比  我为你留了一点012---Oh, actually I got a little bit saved for you, Pheebs.
你觉得  乔伊比我有魅力012---So do you think, uh, Joey is more charming than me'?
对   不然我怎么会跟他睡觉012---Yeah. That's why I'm sleeping with him on the side.
你想得美012---Yeah, you wish.
"你想得美"   菲比  别再写我们了012---"You wish." Phoebe, stop writing about us.
我没写你们   我写别人呢012---I'm not writing about you. I'm writing about other people.
谁  摩莎和钱特012---Who? Marsha and Chester.
好吧  写吧  我也要写菲莉丝的故事012---Okay, fine. Fine. Then you know what? I will just write about Phyllis.
哼   嗯012---Hmm. Huh.
"菲莉丝坐在椅子上"  我知道你想干嘛012---"Phyllis is sitting in the chair." I see what you're doing.
"菲莉丝知道我想干嘛"012---"Phyllis sees what I'm doing." Oh, ho.
哇  我终于自食恶果了012---Ooh, I have tasted my own medicine and it is bitter.
早  嘿012---Morning! Hey!
我最欣赏的天才和我的机器人搭档  好吗012---How's my favorite genius and his robot buddy?
不许碰它  好  行了012---Don't touch him! Okay. All right. Um...
韦恩  你老实说  我一直听说我会被换掉012---Wayne, level with me. Okay? I keep hearing all these rumors that I might get fired.
他们还找人来试我这个角色012---Okay, they even have actors coming in to read for my part.
拜托啦   再给我一次机会012---Come on, man. You gotta give me a second chance.
我爱死这个小家伙了012---I love this little guy-Aah.
好吧  难怪你从不让我碰他  拿去吧012---Okay. That's why you didn't want me to touch him, right? There you go.
白痴  真是的012---Stupid! I can't believe this! God.
嘿  你好吗012---Hey, how are you doing?
看样子我是被放鸽子了012---So it seemed that my prom date had stood me up.
罗斯还大方的提议要带我去012---So Ross selflessly offered to take me.
好动听的故事啊012---What a nice story. Heh.
罗斯上大学时012---So Ross was in college...
想趁虚而入  就带一名少女参加高中舞会012---...and decided to jump at the chance to take a young girl to her prom.
哇  我倒从没从这个角度想过这事012---Wow. I definitely did not see that one backfiring.
我去下洗手间   你慢慢上012---I'm gonna go to the bathroom. Yeah. Take your time.
其实我读大一   她高中毕业   所以倒也不是差很多012---Just so you know, I was a freshman and she was a senior. So it wasn't as bad as--
罗斯  听着  我知道我一直在找你麻烦012---Ross, look. I know I've been giving you a lot of jabs.
因为我爱女心切012---It's partly because I'm very protective of Lizzie...
而且情不自禁012---...and partly because well, they just keep coming to me.
但我得承认  丽莎一直都在夸你012---But I have to admit that after all the wonderful things Lizzie has told me...
瑞秋又说了那么那么多故事012---and the many, many, many stories that Rachel has told me...
看来012---that, well
你也不是012---you're not
那么坏012---all bad.
"压根儿就不坏"012---"Not all bad."
很抱歉之前对你那么苛刻   你得体谅我012---And anyhow, I'm sorry I was so harsh before, But you have to understand.
丽莎在我眼里还是个12岁的小女孩012---I still look at Lizzie like she's a 12-year-old girl.
我懂  我也有同感012---You know, I know what you mean. I do that, too.
你说什么  不  我不是把她当成12岁小女孩012---I beg your pardon? No! No! Not—I don't mean I-I see her as a 12-year-old girl.
我是说  我有个6岁大的儿子  在我眼里就还当是个小婴儿012---I mean, I have a son who's, um, 6, and I still think of him as a baby.
你有儿子  对   我和前妻012---You have a son? Yeah. My ex-wife and I...
共有孩子的监护权012---...uh, share custody of Ben. And, uh--
还有  卡萝和我早已达成共识012---Just so you know, Carol and I are on excellent terms...
相信你和你太太也是012---...as I'm sure you are with your wife.
抱歉012---Oh! I'm sorry.
真是的012---It's unbelievable!
没事   我只是没意识到你结过婚012---Don't worry about it, I just didn't realize you were married.
我们是结过婚   但那只是012---Oh, we were. But that was just a...
只是酒后胡闹罢了012---I mean, that was just a big drunken mistake.
你回来了012---You're back.
你们俩结过婚了012---You two were married?
抱歉  不好意思  你在讲艾蜜莉那次012---Oh, whoops. I'm sorry. You were talking about Emily.
钱德   我们不是约好六点在咖啡馆碰头吗012---Chandler, we said we would meet at the coffee house at 6:00.
约的是7点   约的6点012---We said 7:00. We said 6:00!
我如果有提到6点012---The only way that I said 6:00...
应该是说  "我们约7点   不要约6点"012---...would be if I said the sentence, "Let's meet at 7:00, not at 6:00."
我如果有提到7点   应该会说012---If I had said 7:00, maybe I would have said something like:
"我男朋友真是自作聪明  什么7点"012---"Wow, my boyfriend is such a wiseass. 7:00!"
嗨  天哪012---Hi! Oh my God!
我知道你们约几点  什么012---I know what time you said. What?
我知道摩莎和钱特约的几点012---Well, actually I know what time Chester and Marsha said.
几点  风水轮流转012---What time? Quite an interesting turn of events.
我的书突然成了救星  对吧012---Suddenly it's my book to the rescue, huh? Let's see.
有意思012---Ooh. Very interesting.
这下  真相大白了012---Yeah, well this certainly clears things up.
到底是几点   你们先012---What does it say? I will tell you...
谢谢我写这本书   我就说012---...as soon as you thank me for writing my book.
谢谢你写书  这真是一本好书012---Thank you for writing your book. It's a great book...
你是女王中的女王012---...and you are the queen of everything.
谢谢   你也是012---Thanks. So are you.
我就说我不该穿这个颜色012---I told you I should not wear this color.
"摩 摩莎和钱特  打算星期天晚上去看电影012---"Monica-Marsha and Chester are planning on seeing a movie Sunday night.
摩莎觉得应该约6点012---"Marsha thinks they're supposed to meet at 6:00.
而钱特觉得电影是7点"012---Chester thinks it's at 7:00."
你知道我们会赶不上电影   没错012---So you knew we would miss the movie? That's right.
你不警告我们   而只是把它写在这本白痴书里012---Instead of telling us, you decided to write it in your stupid book?
"摩莎和钱特很生菲莉丝的气"012---"Marsha and Chester are mad at Phyllis."
没想到我竟会失去这份工作012---I can't believe I'm gonna lose this job.
真可惜   我能帮你什么忙吗012---I'm so sorry, man. ls there anything I can do?
能  帮我把那个小冰箱搬走  不要被保安发现012---Yeah. Help me get this mini-fridge past the security guard.
乔伊   我想和你谈谈012---Hey, Joey, I want to talk to you.
是吗  我可不想理你  韦恩  我恨你  你毁了我的一生012---Yeah? I don't want to talk to you, Wayne. I hate you. You ruined my life.
钱德  韦恩  韦恩  钱德  嗨  你好012---Oh, Chandler, Wayne. Wayne, Chandler. Hi. How are you?
乔伊  如果你帮我  我就帮你拿回角色012---Joey, I'll get you your job back if you help me out.
我为什么要帮你012---Why should I help you out?
理由他已经说了  帮你什么012---The reason he just said. What do you need?
我看到你跟那个美女搭讪012---I saw you on stage talking to that beautiful woman.
你认得萨拉   我也想和她搭讪012---You know, Sarah. I wish I could talk to her.
你爱上她了吗  对012---Are you in love with her? Yeah.
所有的美女   谁都好012---Her. All of them. Anyone.
我是过来人  我的朋友012---Yeah. I've been there, my friend.
你教我怎样跟女人搭讪012---Listen, I guarantee you keep your job...
我就保证让你留下来012---...if you can teach me how to talk to women like you do.
韦恩  这种事怎么教法  不过是一种天生的本领012---Oh, Wayne, it's not something you can teach y'know? It's pretty much something you're born with--
你能学得   我来教你012---You can teach it. I can show you right now.
我是说   罗斯其实从每次婚姻中012---I mean, if you think about it...
都学到了一点东西012---...I mean Ross did learn something from each marriage.
学到如何让婚姻变短吗012---How to make the next one even shorter? Oh.
等等   这么说不公平012---Now wait a minute. That's not fair.
我们的婚姻比他和艾蜜莉的长012---He was married to me a hell of a lot longer than he was to Emily.
他只是没告诉我012---He just didn't tell me.
看样子我还得上趟洗手间012---Maybe I have to pee again.
真有意思012---Well, this is fun.
罗斯012---So Ross...
有哪个老婆被你杀了吗012---...did you kill any of these wives?
你知道吗012---You know what? I--
我受够了  我很喜欢你的女儿012---I have had enough of this. Y'know, I care a great deal about your daughter.
我一直很尊重她012---And I have treated her with nothing but respect.
要是你对我有意见  说实话  你在对我吼叫吗012---So if you've got a problem with me. frankly... Are you yelling at me'?
天啊  绝对没有012---God, no.
你知道吗  爸  如果你不喜欢罗斯  也无所谓012---You know what, Daddy? If you don't like Ross, that's fine.
我才不管   我还是要跟他交往012---It doesn't matter to me. I'm gonna go outwith him anyway.
真的012---Really?
要是她不管012---Well, if it doesn't matter to her...
那我也不管   我没有吼叫012---...it doesn't matter to me. Still not yelling.
我还能说什么呢012---Well, what can I say?
我对你仍然没什么好感012---This doesn't make me like you better.
这没什么  我对自己也不是很满意012---That's okay. I'm not so crazy about myself right now either.
那我们达成共识  对  可以这么说012---Then we agree? Yeah, I guess so.
我们没有人喜欢罗斯   我喜欢罗斯012---Neither of us like Ross. I like Ross.
哦  你还小012---Oh, heh, kids!
等等  我又想到罗斯人很好的故事了012---Wait. I just thought of another story about how nice Ross is.
没关系  瑞秋  我们现在不喜欢罗斯了012---That's okay, Rach. We're not liking Ross right now.
这种故事倒是很多012---Oh! Well, I got a lot of those, too. Uh
结果你是对的  吉事012---Well, it turns out you were right, C.H.E.E.S.E.
那批货根本没抵达奥马哈   没错012---That shipment never made it to Omaha? You got it.
而且那个拉比的胡子  100%是马毛012---And the rabbi's beard? 100 percent horse hair.
干得好   吉事012---Nice catch, C.H.E.E.S.E.
吉事   该你说话了012---It's your line, C.H.E.E.S.E.
韦恩  韦恩012---Wayne! Wayne!
我回来了  嘿012---Hi, you guys. Hey.
怎么了012---What's the matter?
又是那种很讨厌的状况012---Well, it's just... It's one of these situations that I just hate.
有一个客人送我三张票012---You know, a massage client gave me three tickets...
是去摩根大通博物馆看展览的012---...to the Helmut Peltz Exhibit at the Morgan Chase Museum.
所以  你觉得你得陪他睡觉012---Now you're thinking you gotta sleep with him.
不  不是  他只给了三张票  但是我们有六个人012---No. No, it's just that he gave me three tickets and there are six of us.
我弃权  我也是012---I'll give up my ticket. Me too.
你们真大方012---Okay. That's so generous.
罗斯也应该很大方的012---And I think Ross is generous too.
太好了  就我们女生去012---Great. Okay. Then it's just us girls.
很棒  对012---Great. Yeah.
那个  是什么展览012---So, what is the exhibit?
主要是图片展012---It's mostly just photographs...
女同的性爱摄影展  视频游戏  送免费三明治012---...of, um, lesbian love scenes interspersed with video games and free sandwiches.
都是你012---Oh, man.
大家好  嘿012---Hi. Hi. Hi there.
嘿  罗斯  听着012---Hey, Ross, listen.
钱德刚把你周末去女同三明治博物馆的机会给让出去了012---Chandler got you out of going to the lesbian sandwich museum this weekend.
谢谢   我另有安排了  伊丽莎白和我要出城去012---Thanks? But I have plans. Uh, Elizabeth and I are going out of town.
太好了  对啊012---Oh, that's great. Yeah.
你要发财了012---Think about all the money that you're gonna make.
什么意思012---Why? What?
是她爸付钱请你当保姆  对吧012---Well, her father pays you for babysitting, right?
哇哦012---Uh-oh. Ha, ha.
不  真好笑   是不是该放我们一马了012---No, no. That's funny. But maybe it's time to move on.
够了  别再闹了  不许再提012---You know, let it go. Stop it.
再说了   瑞秋不是也在和她爸交往嘛012---Besides, Rachel's going out with Elizabeth's father.
而且他比瑞秋老太多了012---So, uh, he's much older than she is.
看来不只是我对化石有兴趣啊012---Looks like I'm not the only one interested in fossils. Huh?
罗斯  这种话只会提醒我们  你的确对化石有兴趣012---I means, all that does is remind us that you are interested in fossils.
好吧  好吧012---Okay, okay.
嗯  以后瑞秋想和他甜言蜜语   要大吼大叫了012---Uh, well, Rachel's gonna to need to yell sweet nothings in his ear. Huh?
罗斯  拜托  难道你们不觉得好笑012---Ross? Oh, come on, that's funny, you know?
他需要戴助听器了012---he's need— he's got, like, a hearing aide, you know?
因为他太老了012---‘cause-‘cause y'know, ‘cause he's all old.
失陪一下012---One second.
听着  罗斯012---Okay, look, Ross.
因为丽莎很喜欢你012---Just so you know, since Lizzie likes you so much...
所以我决定接受你们交往的事实012---...I accept the fact that you're going out with her.
真的  那太好了012---Really? Okay, that's great.
是啊  但现在我改主意了012---Yeah. But then I changed my mind.
我就是这么善变012---I'm funny like that.
我已经警告了丽莎   现在我警告你012---So I've told Lizzie and now I'm telling you.
不许再跟我女儿见面了012---I don't want you seeing my daughter anymore.
好吧   我知道你很不满意012---All right, look. I realize it upsets you.
没错  很不满意012---Yes, it does.
但丽莎和我都是成年人了012---But Elizabeth and I are both adults...
所以我想  你也无可奈何012---...and so I don't think there's really anything you can do about it.
我会告诉校方   让师生恋曝光   你就会被开除012---I'll tell the university about your relationship and have you fired.
有备而来啊012---Oh, a man with a plan.
老友记  第六季  第22集  大逆转012---Friends  S06E22  The One Where Paul's The Man
太帅了   你的照片又重返名人墙了012---This is so exciting. You get your picture back up on the wall of fame.
是啊  之前贴在墙上好酷啊012---I know. It was so cool when it was up there before.
我经常和吉姆贝路西有说有笑012---Me and Jim Belushi would just be cracking up about something.
后来我被《我们的日子》开除   照片就被拿下来012---Then I get fired off Days of Our Lives and he takes me down.
到现在他都在嘲笑我012---Now he's just laughing at me.
你看那个  自呜得意的混蛋012---Look at him. That smug Belushi bastard.
也许他们可以   把你挂在012---Oh. Okay. Maybe when they put your picture back up...
麦特劳尔旁边012---...they could put you next to Matt Lauer.
你看他在冲我微笑012---Look at him just smiling at me. Hee-hee.
我知道   我们俩一定合拍012---Yeah, I know. We'd be great together.
我回来了  你是谁012---Hey. So I'm back. Who are you?
乔伊崔比亚尼012---Joey Tribbiani.
之前上过名人墙的012---From the wall?
也许这样   你会想起来012---Okay, maybe this will jog your memory, huh?
嗯012---Huh?
总之012---Okay, anyway.
我可以返回墙上了  我主演了一出新戏012---I'm ready to go back up on the wall. I'm the star of a new TV show.
翻给我看   还没演呢012---Show me in the TV book. Oh, well, it's not on TV yet.
那你就不能上墙了012---Well, then it's not on the wall yet.
这样吧   我拿录影带给你看  可以吧012---Okay, fine. I will bring you a tape. Huh?
你手边有麦特劳尔的衣服吗012---So, um, now, do you have any of Matt Lauer's clothes here?
或许还有没洗过的012---Maybe just ones that haven't been cleaned yet?
天啊012---God.
哦  我好喜欢到博物馆012---Oh, I love museums.
来接受文化薰陶012---Soaking up all the culture. Yeah.
你想先去哪里   去礼品部012---Where do you want to start? Ooh, the gift shop.
好啊012---Yeah.
然后去用餐   等等  我不能吃太多012---Hey, and then lunch. Oh, wait, yes, but I can't eat too much.
保罗今晚要带我去吃饭   他说会有个大惊喜012---Paul's taking me out to dinner tonight. He said he has a big surprise planned.
他会不会告诉你说  他是个同性恋012---Ow, wow. What do you think? Maybe he's gonna tell you he's gay?
什么啊  不可能  你为什么这么说012---What? No, why?
不为什么   这样才真是个大惊喜啊012---No reason. That would just be a really big surprise, right?
红毯可以铺在这边   然后在这边举办婚礼仪式012---You could put the aisle over here and then have the wedding ceremony here.
原来这里可以办婚礼012---I didn't know you could get married here.
作为婚礼场所   这里太美了012---This would be a beautiful place to get married.
但我不会把红毯铺在那边   更不会在那边举办婚礼仪式012---Yeah, but I wouldn't put the aisle there. And I'd never have the ceremony there.
应该在这个漂亮的拱门下宣誓012---You'd have the ceremony under this big, beautiful arch.
有什么事吗012---May I help you?
抱歉打断你   这地方太美了012---Oh, sorry. Didn't mean to interrupt. It's just such a beautiful space.
常办婚礼吗  是的  这里很受欢迎012---Do you do a lot of weddings here? Yes, we're very popular.
预约都已经排到两年后了   抱歉012---There's a two-year waiting list. Sorry.
摩妮卡  你也应该去报名预约012---Monica, you should totally put your name down for this place.
什么   你疯了吗012---What? Are you crazy?
我又不结婚   甚至还没订婚012---I'm not getting married. I'm not even engaged.
对啊   反正要等两年嘛   要是你两年内订了婚才报名012---Yeah, but there's a two-year wait. What if you get engaged in two years?
不是还得再等两年才能在这里办嘛012---Then you've gotta wait another two years for this place?
加起来就四年了   钱德才不会等那么久012---That's four years. Chandler's not gonna wait that long.
他会去找别人了012---He's gonna find somebody else, you know?
找某个预约报了名的女人012---Someone, someone who did put their name on the list. Mm-hm.
亲爱的  先预约又不会怎样012---Yeah. Honey, it can't hurt to put your name down.
要是两年内没订婚   就放弃不用了012---If in two years you're not engaged, you just don't use it.
有道理   先预约的确不会怎样012---Well, I guess there is no harm in putting my name down.
我也要预约   我也要012---I'm gonna do it too. Me too.
真的  你要嫁给谁012---Really? Who would you marry?
不知道   我现在还没有对象012---I don't know. I don't have anyone right now, you know?
噢  菲比012---Oh, Pheebs.
别为我难过  至少我的男朋友不是同性恋012---Don't feel too sorry for me. At least my boyfriend isn't gay.
菲比  这种事  别招惹我批评你家那个啊012---Phoebe, that's not... Don't even get me started on yours.
嘿012---Hey.
看过我拿来的带子了吗   看过了012---So, did you watch the tape of my show? I did.
怎样  我能上墙了吗  不行  你不能上墙 012---All right. Let's get me back up there. No. You don't go up on the wall.
什么  但你是看了我的片子  对  你那片子冒犯了我们012---What? But you saw the show. Yes. It was very offensive to my people.
冒犯了干洗店一族012---Dry cleaners?
冒犯了俄国人   把他们都当成恐怖分子和恶棍012---Russians. It showed them as terrorists and villains.
好  你看  你墙上还有哈里逊福特012---Okay, okay. Look, you got Harrison Ford up there.
没错   福特先生是个好顾客012---That's right. Mr. Ford is a very good customer.
他能带很多衣服来洗  而你却两手空空012---He brings us a lot of clothes. You bring us nothing.
说得也许对012---Okay, well, that may be true.
但《空军一号》里   俄国人是恐怖分子  很邪恶012---But, in-in .Air Force One. okay, the Russians  were terrorists and evil.
他还杀了一堆俄国人  那才是冒犯俄国人呢012---And plus, he kills a bunch of them. That's offensive to Russians.
我没看过  你应该要看  很赞012---I've never seen it. Oh, you should. It's great.
这里真的好漂亮012---This place is really beautiful.
对啊  我从小就常来  这里以前是我奶奶家012---Yeah. I've been coming here since I was a kid. This used to be my grandma's.
可我只遗传了我奶奶的眼睛012---Wow. The only thing I got from my grandmother was her eyes. Heh.
我不是说她的眼珠子012---I mean, not her actual eyeballs.
但大家都说我的眼睛长得像012---But people say that my eyes look...
你要不要亲热   要啊  好啊012---Do you want to make out? Sure. Ha, ha.
你还好吗012---Are you okay?
怎么了012---What's wrong? Uh...
我只是想起了你爸爸012---Yeah, I was just thinking about your father.
只要能让你兴奋就好  不是012---Well, whatever works for you. No.
不  不  不是  是他有点把我吓到了012---No, no. Uh, he just really freaked me out before.
哦012---Oh.
那我们还得再多瞒着一个人012---Well, so we have to hide our relationship from one more person.
那又怎样  而且  我们也喜欢这样偷偷摸摸着玩012---Big deal. Besides, we've had fun hiding it.
也对012---Yeah.
嘿   嗯012---Hey. Yeah.
你有带防护用具吗012---Um, you brought protection, right?
怎么了  这里有熊出没吗012---Why? Are there, like, bears or something?
不是  那个012---No. Oh, uh...
你是说那个  没有  我简直忘了012---Oh, protection, yeah. No. That I forgot.
那我赶快去商店里买012---Ha, ha. I'll just run to the store and get some.
不   嘿  我是男人  应该我去买012---No. Hey, hey. I'm the guy. I'll get it.
你知道商店在哪里   不知道012---Do you know where the store is? No.
那你想骑我粉红脚踏车满城转悠吗012---Do you want to ride around town on my little pink bicycle?
有点想012---A little bit.
我十分钟后回来  好012---I'll be back in 10 minutes. Okay.
那不如你先泡个热澡   在浴缸里等我012---Why don't you get in the hot tub and I'll meet you there.
好012---Oh, okay.
天哪   好棒的惊喜  这房子真漂亮012---Oh, my God. What a great surprise. This is such a beautiful house.

我只是觉得预约多好玩的012---And I just put our names down for fun.
也不会怎么样的嘛   是吗012---I mean, what's the harm in that? Right here.
钱德   千万别以为我想逼婚012---Chandler, please don't think I was trying to pressure you.
菲比和瑞秋觉得   菲比和瑞秋012---Phoebe and Rachel just thought... Phoebe and Rachel?
所以她们比我早知道   我们要结婚的012---So the people that knew about our wedding before me were you...
菲比和瑞秋   希蒂012---...Phoebe and Rachel, Hildy...
和一个叫《星光魔力》的乐团都先知道的012---...and apparently some band called Star Light Magic Seven...
只有他们有空012---...who are available, by the way.
是我错了012---It was a mistake.
这没什么意义   别当真012---Please don't take this to mean anything, because it doesn't.
好吧012---Okay.
真的吗012---Really?
如果你真的没有那个意思  你知道的我也还没准备好012---Yes. If it really doesn't mean anything, because you know I'm just not ready.
我知道  我知道012---I know. I know.
好012---Okay.
好012---All right.
我去告诉乔伊你回来了012---Now, I'm gonna go tell Joey that you're back.
我们刚才好担心012---We were really worried about you.
她信了吗   确信无疑012---Hey, did she buy it? Totally.
希蒂有带你参观场地了吗  有  美仑美奂012---So did Hildy show you the place? Yeah. It's beautiful.
你居然要跟摩妮卡求婚了012---I can't believe you're gonna ask Monica to marry you.
就是啊012---I know.
阿甘  把这些卡布奇诺瑞到11号桌012---Hey, Gunther. Take these cappuccinos to Table 11.
那个男的点了小甜饼012---And that guy over there wants some biscotti.
我只是要外带一杯咖啡012---Oh. Well, I just actually came in for a cup of coffee to go.
你还在这里上班吗012---Do you still work here?
没有  我早就不做了012---No, no. I quit a long time ago.
我忘了通知你   抱歉012---Did I forget to tell you that? I'm sorry.
算了  反正我也打算开除你  太好了012---Oh, that's cool, I was gonna fire you anyway. Great.
菲比   你能帮我挑个订婚戒指给摩妮卡吗012---Pheebs, can you help me pick an engagement ring for Monica?
我没法决定   好难挑啊012---I can't figure this out. It's so hard.
我要选第凡内切割法的  还是公主方切割法的还是012---Should I get her a Tiffany cut, or a princess cut or a--
噢噢   被纸切割法012---Ow! Paper out!
你跟其他人说了吗012---Now, have you told anyone else?
没有  我没告诉其他人  我不想让摩妮卡发现012---No, I don't want to tell anybody else because I don't want Monica to find out.
可你告诉我了012---You told me.
因为我信任你   你是我最好的朋友之一012---Well, that's because I trust you, and we're best friends...
还有我正在看戒指广告的时候   你进来了012---...and you walked in on me while I was looking at ring brochures.
下次我不敲门进来的话012---Yeah well, once again, not knocking pays off.
我只希望你不要刚好在蹲马桶就好了  我希望也是012---I only wish you hadn't been on the toilet. Me too.
嘿   嘿012---Hey. Hey.
钱德  要不要去喝咖啡  好啊  走吧012---So Chandler, wanna go to the coffeehouse? Oh, all right.
好极了  我们正想找你们一块去012---Oh, perfect. We were just gonna see if you wanted to go.
不了  我们去另外一家012---Oh, well, we don't, because we got the other place.
真没礼貌012---How rude.
抱歉  你想咬一口吗012---Oh, I'm sorry. You want a bite?
老友记  第六季  第23集  订婚戒指012---Friends  S06E23  The One With The Ring
你和保罗交往得怎么样012---So how are things going with Paul?
很好啊012---Good. Huh.
只不过   他不太爱说话012---Although, you know, he's a private guy. Mm-hm.
真想让他稍微敞开点心胸   好分享他的感受012---You know, I wish I could get him to open up a bit. Share some feelings.
这太容易了   把他当成一罐打不开的泡菜012---That's easy. You just have to think of him as a jar of pickles that won't open.
你是说012---So, what are you saying?
我应该把他泡进热水里   然后把他的头往桌子上撞012---I should run him under hot water and bang his head against a table?
不是  那是严刑逼供012---No, that's what you do when you want to get the truth out of someone.
嗨  嗨012---Hi. Hi.
你好吗   看我的012---How are you? Watch this.
嘿  保罗  嘿   菲比012---Hey, Paul. Hi, Phoebe.
你最近好吗012---So how are things going with you?
没说的012---Can't complain.
嘿   嘿012---Hey! Hi.
嗨  罗斯  我也很高兴见到你012---Great to-Ross, good to see you too.
我很好   拜  保重012---Good. Bye. You take care.
菲比   你们在搞什么鬼   钱德还放我们鸽子012---Hey, Pheebs, what was the deal with you and Chandler blowing us off before?
很奇怪  对吧012---Ah, that was so weird, huh?
菲比   为什么要这么做012---Phoebe, why did you do it?
不是我   是钱德012---I didn't do it. It was Chandler.
他  他在生你的气012---He's-He's mad at you.
什么   为什么  拜托   你明知故问012---What? Why? Oh, please. I think you know why.
我想不起来012---I can't think of anything.
罗斯  你是古生物学家  再往下挖深一点012---Come on, Ross. You're a paleontologist. Dig a little deeper.
等等   是不是因为两个星期前   乔伊和我没找他012---Wait a minute, is it because Joey and I didn't invite him to that Knicks game...
去看纽约尼克斯队的球赛012---...a couple weeks ago?
你觉得他会为这种事生气吗012---Do you think that's something that he'd be mad at you for?
应该会  那好  我也是这么想012---I guess it could. Well, then I think that's it.
如果他生气了  他为什么不说呢012---Well, if he's angry, he really shouldn't just cover it up.
我希望他能告诉我012---I wish he'd just tell me the truth.
那你应该抓着他的头012---Oh, if that's what you want...
泡进热水里  再把他的头往桌子上撞012---...then you really should run him under hot water and bang his head against the table.
亲爱的   我在中国花园订了位   你好了吗012---Honey, I made a reservation at China Garden. Is that okay?
可以啊   太棒了012---Yeah, that's great.
先等等   给我说说说   你今天好不好012---But first, wait, talk to me, talk to me. Tell me about your day.
蛮好的012---It was fine.
好吧012---0Kay.
嘿   你在想什么  你此刻在想什么012---Hey, what are you thinking? What are you thinking right now?
我在想你穿这条裙子真漂亮012---I'm thinking that you are looking really fine in that dress.
太好了  保罗  但是012---Yeah, that's great, Paul. But, you know...
我想知道  哇  好结实012---I want to know what-Wow, those are really great.
我想知道012---I just want to know...
在这坚强平静的外表下面到底隐藏着什么012---...what is behind this strong, silent exterior?
俗语说静水深流012---You know, they say that still waters run deep...
我想在你的心中畅游012---...and I want to swim in yours.
你是说做爱012---Are you talking about having sex?
不  保罗012---No, PauL
我一点也不了解你012---I don't know anything about you.
比如你的童年   跟我聊聊你小时候的事吧012---You know, like your childhood. Tell me about your childhood.
很普通012---Normal.
好吧  那青春期呢  如何  那是一段痛苦的时光012---Okay, well, then how about puberty? Come on. That's always a painful time.
你的朋友请你参加聚会012---You know, your friends invite you to a slumber party...
趁你睡着   把你的手放进热水里012---...and stick your hand in warm water...
让你尿在睡袋里012---...while you're sleeping so that you pee in your sleeping bag.
我没碰过那种事012---No, that never happened to me.
那是你走运   没碰上那个贱人莎朗麦杰斯基012---Well, you're lucky you never met that bitch, Sharon Majeski.
总之012---Anyway...
你有后悔过吗012---The rest of your life, you know. Any regrets?
没有012---No.
好吧   保罗  我要求得不多012---All right, Paul. I'm not asking for a lot here.
你就告诉我点什么   随便什么都行012---Okay? Just give me something. Anything.
好吧  好012---okay. okay
我6岁那年012---When I was 6 years old... Mm-hm.
想要一辆大脚踏车012---...I wanted a Big Wheel.
父母却送我一只  塑料小鸡012---And instead, my parents got me this little...
骑着到处跳的那种012---...plastic chicken that you hop around on.
太难为情了  小朋友都取笑我012---It was embarrassing. Kids made fun of me.
那一年  真够难过的012---That was a pretty tough year.
太好了  你看吧012---That's great. See? Heh.
我觉得我更了解你了   谢谢012---I already feel like I know you a little better. Thank you.
好  我们去吃饭吧   走吧012---Okay, come on. Now we can go eat. Let's go.
我好惨012---It was horrible.
他们都叫我 "小鸡孩"012---They called me "Chicken Boy."
五年级我跟别人打架   其实也不算真打了012---In fifth grade, I got in a fight. Well, it wasn't really a fight.
理查达伦一拳打在我鼻子上012---Richard Danville bit me on the nose.
我摔倒了  这里留了个小伤疤  你看嘛012---I fell down, still have a little scar right here. You can see it.
有  我看见了012---Yeah, yeah. I see the scar.
保罗  你听我说  你能分享这些感受真是太好了012---Listen, Paul, I think this is really great that, you know, you've shared your feelings.
真的很棒012---It's really... It's beautiful.
但是你刚才说我们去吃什么012---But, urn, what do you say we go share some food?
我现在吃不下012---No, I couldn't eat now.
说什么啊   你最爱吃宫保鸡丁了012---What are you talking about? You love their Kung Pao chicken.
鸡012---Chicken?
鸡弟弟  天哪  对不起  我不是故意的012---Chicken Boy! I'm sorry. I didn't mean to do that.
逛了几百家首饰店   一无所获012---Well, this is the nine millionth ring store we've been to...
还是找不到完美的戒指012---...and I can't find the perfect ring.
难看  难看  难看012---Ugly ring, ugly ring, ugly ring...
漂亮  精品012---It's a beautiful selection.
要不然   你不要送戒指012---Okay, so maybe you don't get her a ring.
送点不一样的012---Maybe you do something different, you know?
例如订婚手镯   或是订婚皇冠012---Maybe you get her an engagement bracelet. Or an engagement tiara.
或者  一把订婚独立战争毛瑟枪012---Ooh! An engagement Revolutionary War musket.
真高兴选你来帮忙012---You know, I'm so glad I picked you to help me with this.
想像一下你单膝跪地012---Can't you imagine getting down on one knee...
向她献上这把漂亮的武器012---...and handing her this gorgeous piece of weaponry?
我看   还是送戒指好了012---Yeah, I'm gonna stick with the ring.
这只好漂亮   我喜欢这只012---Oh, this one's nice. I like it this one.
先生  大哥  我可以看这枚戒指吗012---Sir? Kind sir, can I see this one?
等等   你找我来就是因为012---Wait a minute. This is the reason you brought me, okay?
我会砍价  所以接下来交给我处理012---I know how to haggle. So let me handle this from here on out.
有什么需要吗012---Can I help you?
有  我想看那枚戒指   要么什么都不看  随便012---Yes, I would like to see that ring, please. Or not. Whatever.
这是一只20年代的戒指012---This ring is from the 1920s.
上面有1点5克拉钻石   两侧各镶有蓝宝石012---It's a one-and-a-half karat diamond with sapphires on either side.
先生  你能不能012---Sir, could I ask you to, um...?
拿出这只戒指向我求婚012---Could you hold out that ring and ask me to marry you?
好啊   好012---Okay. Okay.
你愿意嫁给我吗012---Will you marry me?
天哪  就是它了  就选这个012---Oh, my God, that's it. That's the ring.
多少钱   钱德   让我来012---How much is it? Chandler, I will handle this.
多少钱012---How much is it?
8千6百元块美元012---Eight thousand six hundred.
我们出10块012---We will give you $10.
你到底想不想买啊  想  想012---Are you interested in this ring? Yes. Yes.
但我只能出8千块012---But I can only pay $8000.
好  8千可以  我们坚持只付10块钱012---Okay. I can let it go for 8. We stand firm at $10.
您用什么付帐   刷信用卡012---How would you like to pay? Uh, credit card.
喔   糟了  我的卡在乔伊那边了012---Oh, no. No, no, but I lent my credit card to Joey.
没事  我回去拿   你守住戒指  好的012---Okay, I'll go get it. You guard the ring. Okay.
刚才的事很抱歉啊012---Listen, I'm sorry about before.
你们这里有10块钱的东西吗012---Do you have anything here for $10?
有啊   我有两张崭新的012---Uh, yes. I have these two rather beautiful...
5元钞票012---...five-dollar bills.
我出1块钱跟你买012---I'll give you $1 for them.
嘿  记得钱德和菲比昨天把我们甩了吗012---Hey, remember how Chandler and Phoebe blew us off yesterday?
不记得012---No.
记得吗  你当时在吃披萨   对啊012---Remember, you were eating pizza? Yeah.
很明显  钱德在生气012---Well, apparently Chandler's angry at us...
就为我们两星期前   没帮他买纽约尼克斯队的球票012---...for not getting him a ticket to that Knicks game a couple weeks ago.
我们为什么要帮他买票012---What, we were supposed to just get him a ticket?
那家伙老是揩我们的油   就是啊012---That guy is always mooching off of us. Yeah.
但不管怎么样   我想我们该做点什么012---Anyway, I still think we should try to patch things up, you know?
也许我们可以给他搞张尼克斯队比赛的票和他一起去看012---Like, maybe we could get him tickets to another Knicks game and invite him.
好主意   而且他的信用卡也在我这里012---Wow, that's a great idea. And I still have his credit card.
您的帐单012---Here you go.
嘿  嘿  我有卡  拿去吧012---Hey, hey. I got this one. Here you go.
我跟你说  有时候我真搞不懂钱德012---You know, I gotta tell you, sometimes I just don't get Chandler.
我们一直背着你出去玩012---You know, me and him do stuff all the time without you...
你也不会生气012---...and you don't get all upset.
一直   一直012---All the time? All the time.
我的天哪   我的天哪012---Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
还在哭   跟小女生一样012---Still crying? Like a little girl.
我知道   我知道都是我不好012---I know, I know, I know. This is all my fault.
是我要他敞开心胸的012---I wanted him to open up.
但是我不知道我会放出一头012---But God, I didn't know that I was gonna unleash...
哭哭啼啼又黏人的怪物012---...this weepy, clingy, moist monster.
我只知道有两种方法可以让男人闭嘴012---You know, I only know of two sure-fire ways to shut a man up.
其中一种是性爱012---And one of them is sex.
另外一个是呢   不知道012---What's the other? I Don't know.
我从来不需要用到另一种012---I never had to use the other one.
我只是说  如果作爱就没时间讲话012---I'm just saying, you know, if we're having sex, he's not talking.
没错  话多的是你012---Ah, that's right. You're the talker.
不管怎么说  是个好主意  对012---Anyway, uh, great idea. Yeah.
我得去趟商店   我答应去帮他买纸巾012---Um, I gotta go to the store. I told him that I would buy him some more tissues.
我们这里有  不  你们没有012---Uh, we have some here. No, you don't.
好  我还想试试这顶王冠012---Okay. Um, I'd also like to try on the tiara.
太好了012---Oh, yeah. Okay.
你觉得怎么样   太花了012---Wow, what do you think? Too much?
有点点012---A tad.
好吧  把皇冠放回去012---Then take the tiara back...
再让我试试那把枪012---...and let me hold the musket again.
少了点什么012---Something's missing.
好   把我朋友挑的戒指拿给我看看012---Let me see the ring that my friend picked out.
那枚20年代的钻戒呢012---Where's the 1920s princess-cut ring?
刚刚卖给那位先生了012---I just sold it to that gentleman.
完蛋了012---Oh, my God!
等等   别走012---Wait, no!
放我出去   快点012---Let me out! Now!
瑞秋012---Rachel?
不是012---No.
保罗  你好吗   还好012---How are you, Paul? Okay.
钱德012---Chandler...
你爸抱过你吗   没有  他抱过你吗012---...did your dad ever hug you? No. Did he hug you?
没有  没有012---No. No.
我父亲从来没拥抱过我012---It's just that my dad never did.
我好想念我爸012---I miss my dad.
你可以去赌城   看我爸亲别人的爸爸012---Well, you can see my dad in Vegas kissing other dads.
嘿   钱德   怎样012---Hey, Chandler? Yeah?
你能不能012---Would you...?
你能不能抱抱我012---Would you hug me?
我现在有点忙  保罗  我爸以前都这么说012---I'm a little busy here, Paul. That's exactly what my dad used to say.
好啦  就一下下  来吧  快点012---Okay. A quick one. Come on, hug it out.
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
行了吧012---There you go.
好了012---0Kay.
再多5秒钟   够了012---Five more seconds-Okay.
乔伊  什么   嘿012---Joey! What? Hey, what--?
嗨   保罗  是吧012---Hi. Paul, is it?
你拿了我的信用卡  是  在我的012---Do you have my credit card? Yeah. It's in my...
我的口袋里012---In my pocket.
后面的口袋  后袋  幸好012---My back pocket. Back pocket. Thank God.
听着  我买了今晚尼克斯队的票  我不能去012---Listen, I got tickets to the Knicks tonight. I can't go.
去啦   会很好玩的012---Come on, it'll be fun.
我  你  罗斯  也许还有保罗012---Me, you, Ross and... Paul, probably.
钱德   我找到了最完美的戒指012---Chandler, I found the perfect ring.
真不错   但我还是想买之前挑重的那款012---Oh, that's pretty nice, but I'm gonna go with the one I picked first.
天哪  钱德  你挑的那只戒指不在了  没了012---Oh, wake up, Chandler. The one you picked is gone. It's over.
什么012---What?
对不起  被人买走了  我想拦住他  却被他们关进监狱里012---Some guy bought it. I'm sorry. I tried to stop him but they put me in jail.
把你关进监狱里   就是两道门之间的小监狱012---They put you in jail? The little jail between the doors!
菲比  我要你看着那只戒指  我知道  对不起012---Phoebe, I asked you to guard the ring. I know. I'm sorry.
你看  这只更漂亮   摩妮卡莫不会看到其他戒指的012---But, you know, this ring is better. And Monica never even saw the other ring.
是啊  但是他用那只戒指向我求婚时  我起了鸡皮疙瘩012---Yeah. But when he proposed to me with the ring, I got goose bumps.
也许是因为那个男人  是因为那枚戒指012---Maybe it was the guy. It was the ring.
嘿  他听到票的事兴奋吗  不  他回绝了012---Hey, so was he excited about the tickets? No. He blew us off.
什么  真的012---What? I know.
真不敢相信012---I can't believe it.
告诉你012---Can I tell you something?
我现在真的有点生他的气012---I'm a little mad at him now.
告诉你012---Can I tell you something?
我也是012---Me too.
他生气不告诉我们012---You know what? He didn't want to talk to us about being angry?
那好吧  我们也什么都不要告诉他012---Well, maybe we don't talk to him at all.
把他打入冷宫   没错012---Freeze him out. That's right.
我喜欢  给他好看012---I like it. Ah? We'll show him.
从今以后  就是乔伊与罗斯  最佳拍档012---From now on, it's gonna be Joey and Ross, best friends.
我们将是新的乔伊与钱德012---Okay, we're gonna be the new Joey and Chandler. Ha, ha.
嗨  我回来了012---Hi, I'm back.
我把想说的话都写下来了012---Hey! I have so much more to tell you. I've written it all down.
真好012---Oh, that's great.
其实  这个012---No, actually, that's...
真是太好了  真的好棒012---That's great. That's really great.
说真的  写字  写东西  会燃起012---You know, I gotta tell you, writing, all that writing, it gets me, uh...
燃起我的欲火012---It gets me kind of hot.
等等  你听这个012---Wait, wait. Listen to this:
你知道我小时候想当什么吗012---Know what I wanted to be when I was that age?
情圣012---A lover?
冲浪运动员   是吗  冲浪运动员012---A surfer. Oh, yeah. A surfer?
我想与海浪为伍  停一停012---I wanted to be one with the waves-Honey, hold on real quick.
等一下  让我坐得更舒服一点012---Hold on a second. Let me just get a little more comfortable here.
等一下012---Wait, now wait a second,
我这样是不是太暴露了  不会012---This isn't too revealing, is it? No.
当年那个小家伙呢012---Whatever happened to that little dude?
充满了梦想012---So full of dreams.
我不在乎那个什么小家伙012---I don't care about the little dude.
我没办法   我听不下去了012---I can't. I cannot listen to any more of this.
只有心理医师才想听这些话012---Y'know, the only person who'd listen to this is a mental health professional.
因为他们听这个每1小时赚1百元012---And that's only because they get paid $100 an hour.
你知道我听到现在可以赚多少012---Do you know how much money I could've made listening to you?
2000块钱012---Two thousand dollars.
你知道我什么时候算出来的   就在你说话的时候012---And you know when I figured that out? While you were talking.
你居然想让我闷死吗  14个小时前012---I can't believe you're trying to stifle me, when just 14 hours ago...
我们刚刚谈到我妈就是想这么对我的012---...we figured out that that's exactly what my mother was trying to do to me.
对不起012---I'm sorry.
我不是有意的  我不是想把你闷死012---I don't mean... I didn't mean to stifle you.
我只是没办法控制自己012---This is all just a little overwhelming.
瑞秋012---Oh, Rachel.
对不起012---I'm so sorry.
我不是故意的012---I didn't mean to overwhelm you.
只不过情绪一发泄012---It's just that when those gates open...
就容易一发不可收拾012---...it's hard to close them.
不过现在没事了  真的012---But they are closed now. Believe me.
我很高兴  你跟我分享这些事012---I'm so glad. I'm so glad you shared.
也很高兴你说完了012---And I'm glad that you're done.
那我们要不要012---So, what do you say we, um...
我求之不得012---I'd really like that. Mm-hm.
真是太棒了012---That was so good.
嘿   我居然听了你的话012---Hey. I can't believe you talked me into...
买了这只造型怪异的廉价戒指012---...buying this stupid gumball-machine-looking ring.
它才不廉价呢   看它多漂亮啊012---It's not a stupid gumball-machine-looking ring. It's a beautiful ring.
才不漂亮呢012---No, it's not.
另外一枚戒指012---When I looked at the other ring...
我能看见拿给摩妮卡时的表情012---...I could see Monica's face when I gave it to her...
还能看到她点头答应012---...and I could see her saying yes.
看看这只戒指   怎么看它都是一只戒指012---When I look at this ring, all I see is a ring.
只有近看  才能看到我的眼睛012---Unless I look at it really closely, and then I can see my own eye.
这是我这辈子要做的最重要的一件事012---Look, this is the most important thing I'm gonna do in my life.
我希望做的完美无缺012---I want to make sure it's perfect.
好   那我们或许还有办法把那只戒指要回来012---Okay. There may be a way that we could get the other ring back.
我偷听到那人告诉珠宝店  他准备求婚的地方012---Because I heard the guy tell the jeweler where he was gonna propose.
或许我们可以说服他交换或怎么样012---So maybe we could get him to trade rings or something.
我做不到012---I can't do that.
你总不能给她那只廉价的戒指吧012---Well, you certainly can't give her that stupid gumball ring.
他在那012---There he is.
还好  他还没求婚   那个女的没有戴戒指012---Okay, and he hasn't proposed yet. She has no ring on her finger.
你真行   下次我们应该一起来破案012---Wow, you're good. After this, we should solve crimes.
没错  去请他过来012---Yeah. Okay. Go get him.
好吧012---Oh, okay.
抱歉   先生  请您过来一下  有您的电话012---Excuse me, sir. Could you come with me, please? You have a phone call.
是谁   是你的办公室打来的012---Who is it? It is your office.
你知道是谁吗  约翰012---Do you know who at my office? John.
约翰啊  太好了012---Oh, John. Great.
他来了   你好012---There he is. Hi. Hi. Okay.
是这样  珠宝店搞错了012---Okay, there was a mix-up at the jewelry store.
你打算用来求婚的戒指是我预订的012---The ring you're about to propose with was supposed to be held for me.
所以我想把它换回来012---So I'm gonna need to have that back.
不过作为交换   我愿意拿这只更漂亮更值钱的戒指和你交换012---But in exchange, I'm willing to trade you this beautiful, more expensive ring.
哇  要是我就换了012---Wow, I would trade.
的确很漂亮   但是我就想用这只求婚  失陪了012---It is beautiful, but I'm gonna use this one. Now, if you'll excuse me.
不  不  这位是我的未婚妻   她就是要这枚戒指012---No, no. See, this is my fiancée, and her heart was set on that ring.
你不会想伤她的心吧012---You don't want to break her heart now, do you?
对啊   你想伤一位垂死女人的心吗012---Yeah. Do you want to break a dying woman's heart?
你要死了012---You're dying?
她快死了012---Yeah, she's dying...
很明显  她快咳死了012---...of a cough, apparently.
对  这是我临死前的愿望  如果我不能戴着这只戒指安息012---It's my dying wish to have that ring. See, if I'm not buried with that ring...
我就会变成孤魂野鬼游荡在阴间012---...then my spirit will wander the netherworld--
好了  够了  亲爱的012---Okay, that's enough, honey.
我不知道012---Oh, I don't know.
让我看看戒指   当然  看吧012---Let me see the ring. Great. Okay, here.
好吧  谢谢  谢谢  谢谢012---All right, I'll do it. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

我要送她一瓶她最爱的香槟   那她就知道那里有多贵了012---I'm going to get her a bottle of the champagne she really loves, therefore knows how expensive it is.
然后等酒斟好了  在祝酒之前  我会向她求婚012---Then, when the glasses are full, instead of proposing a toast, I'm just gonna propose.
听起来好棒啊012---Aw. Sounds perfect!
你会搞砸的   让我来吧012---You're gonna mess it up let me do it.

我们去找出价第二高的人  然后让他们去买012---We'll go to the next highest bidder, and we'll let them buy it.
你只要出差价就行了012---Then you're just gonna pay the difference.
好吧012---0Kay.
我不明白这些小孩要活动中心干嘛012---Look, I don't know why the kids need a youth center anyway.Y'know?
放了学跟我一样看电视  像我现在也蛮好的012---They should just watch TV after school like I did. And I turned out fine.
但是不优秀012---Not great.
所以  我们就躲在洗手间里012---And so, we're hiding in the bathroom...
然后我溜了出来  但摩妮卡还没出来  她父母就进去了012---And-and then I sneak out. But before Monica can, her parents come in.
于是我躲到浴帘后面  你知道吗012---So I hide in the shower, next thing you know...
他们就在浴室地板上做起来了012---...they're going at it right on the bathroom floor.
我的天哪012---Oh, my God!
我有一个  我有一个012---I got a good one. I got a good one.
我有一次撞见我父母  跟同一个男人做爱012---I once walked in on both my parents making love to the same guy.
很高兴再见到你们   我想敬酒012---It's so great seeing you guys again. I'd like to make a toast.
正如一位诗人所说  "在友谊的甜蜜里012---Uh, as a poet once said, "In the sweetness of friendship...
让我们尽情欢笑   分享欢乐吧012---...let there be laughter and sharing of pleasures for...
人心正是从每一件小事中012---...in the dew of little things...
获得朝气  使我们的心灵充满活力"012---...the heart finds its morning and is refreshed."
哦012---Aw.
什么012---What?
天哪  你们两个012---Oh, my God! You guys!
在你开口之前  我们有事要说  猜猜我们吃饭时遇见谁了012---Before you say anything, have we got a story for you. Guess who we bumped into at dinner!
谁  理查012---Who? Richard!
哦  哦012---Oh. Oh.
我以为你要和伊丽莎白约会012---I thought you were going out with Elizabeth.
本来是的   不过当时她忙着打水仗012---Yeah, I was but uh, she was a little busy with a water balloon fight.
听着  罗斯  有时大人也不会兑现他们的承诺012---Oh Ross, sometimes grownups have commitments they just can't get out of.
也许她对我是年轻了点012---Maybe she is too young for me.
当我看到她跟朋友这么打闹   我觉得我就像个保姆012---When I was over there and she was running around with her friends, I felt like I was a babysitter.
我终于开始明白你们说的话了   我不知道该怎么办012---I finally see what you were talking about. I don't know what to do.
你可以衡量一下这段感情的利弊012---Why don't you just weigh the good stuff about the relationship against the bad stuff.
就是我该先做什么  衡量一下012---That's what I did when I first started weighing stuff.
好吧   坏的方面   我比她大12岁012---Okay, urn, bad stuff. Well, I'm- I'm 12 years older than she is.
学校发现   会开除你012---If the school finds out you're fired.
她要离开3个月  去参加夏令营012---She's leaving for three months. For camp.
然后   好的方面012---Okay, good stuff. Um...
她很可爱  很漂亮012---Well, she's sweet and pretty and...
罗斯  唯一的问题是问你自己  你看得见未来吗012---Look Ross, the only question you need to ask is, do you see a future?
你能想像跟她结婚吗012---Do you see yourself marrying her?
天哪  你做了  你已经娶她了  对不对012---My God. You did it already. You married her, didn't you?
没有啦  我并没有  只是012---No! No! I didn't do that. It's just...
好吧  老实说  我觉得我们没什么未来012---Okay, Honestly, no, I don't, I don't see a big future with her.
这就是你的答案了012---Okay, I think that's your answer.
我得告诉她   我最恨这一步了012---I gotta talk to her. I hate this part.
忘了伊丽莎白  你要是不小心012---Forget Elizabeth. I mean if you're not careful...
今年可能会结不到婚012---...you may not get married at all this year.
瑞秋  瑞秋012---Rash , Rash.
出第二高价的人在一号桌  太好了012---Next highest bidder is at table one. Great.
竞标到巴黎之旅的人坐4号桌  噢  好极了012---Oh and uh the guy who got the Paris trip is at table four. Oh, okay.
你干嘛管谁赢到巴黎之旅啊012---Why do you care about the guy who won the Paris trip?
那是双人之旅012---It's a trip for two.
失陪了012---Excuse me.
抱歉  竞标到巴黎之旅的人  在这一桌吗012---Excuse me. ls the person who won the Paris trip at this table?
我就是012---That was me. Oh. en chante.
抱歉  有没有一位波芒先生012---Uh, excuse me is there a Mr. Bowmont at this table?
我就是012---That's me. Ah.
你好  你今天走运了  波芒先生012---Oh well, Hello. This is your lucky day, Mr. Bowmont.
那艘帆船又要卖了012---The, uh, Gentleman Daysailer has become available again.
你开了1万8的价格  不是吗012---and I believe you made a bid of $18,000?
你必须要付钱   这不是个竞猜012---You have to pay that. It's not just a guess.
没竞标到船   实际上我还松了一口气012---I was actually relieved, uh, I didn't win the boat.
我老婆会宰了我012---My wife would've killed me.
不会吧   她会爱上这艘船的012---Are you kidding? She'll love this boat!
是啊  尊夫人芳名  她叫潘012---Y-Yeah! What is your wife's name? It's Pam.
潘  天哪  想像一下叫  "潘号"012---Pam. Oh God okay, Just imagine this. The Pam.
哇喔012---Aw.
我想她不会喜欢的012---I don't think she'd like that.
那想像一下叫  "波芒先生号"012---Okay. Uh, imagine this: The Mr. Bowmont.
还是不要了012---I don't think so.
让我给你描绘一下  行吗012---Okay, look. Let me paint you a little picture. All right.
你正在哈德逊河上航行  风吹过你的（头） 胳膊012---You are setting sail up the Hudson. You've got the wind in your ha-Arms.
你在享受着企盼已久的平静和安宁012---You get all that peace and quiet that you've always wanted.
你回到大自然的怀抱   你可以钓鱼012---You get back to nature. You can go fishing.
你还可以戴顶帽子   别人会叫你船长012---You get one of those hats, and people call you captain.
等你老了就是  老船长012---And then when you're old, Cappy.
管他的  不买说不过去  我买了012---What the hell. It's for a good cause. All right!
别想  船是我的  什么012---No way! It's mine! What?
你刚说的那些  也是我想要的012---The stuff you said, I want that!
但是乔伊  你没有两万元012---But, Joey, you don't have $20,000!
管他的  我分期  无论如何我都要 "波芒先生号"012---Who cares? I'll make payments! whatever it takes, I want the Mr. Bowmont!
天哪  你回来了012---Oh, my God! You're back!
让我看  让我看你的手012---Let me see your hand!
为什么要看我的手012---Why do you want to see my hand?
我想看你手上拿的什么  我想看垃圾012---I want to see what's in your hand, I wanna see the trash.
好脏啊  你最好拿去扔了012---Ew, it's all dirty. You should throw this out.
好012---0Kay.
你们搞什么啊  怎么回事012---What did you  guys just do? What happened?
理查也在  我无法开口  不会吧012---Richard was there. I couldn't do it. Oh, no.
我要拖延到明天  给她个惊喜  却被你们破坏了012---I was gonna do it tomorrow y'know,and surprise her. but now you've ruined it.
我们没有破坏012---We didn't ruin it!
谁会一进门就要看别人的手012---Who walks into a room and asks to see a person's hands?
算命师  修指甲的小姐  手部医生012---Well, a palm reader, a manicurist, a hand doctor.
手套推销员  漂亮012---Glove salesman. Good one!
真惨  我该怎么办012---This is terrible. What am I gonna do?
她只是在怀疑  又不确定  你可以唬她012---Look, she only suspects something okay? She doesn’t know for sure, so just throw her off the track.
也对  我可以让她觉得  我完全不考虑结婚012---That’s right, I'll make her think, uh, marriage is the last thing on my mind.
没错  让她相信你很害怕承诺012---Yeah. Convince her you're scared of commitment.
这我做得到  我都练了30年了012---I can do that. I've had 30 years of practice.
你这个人总算有点价值了012---Hey, being you is finally gonna pay off!
我还得跑去地下室扔012---I had to go to the basement...
某个白痴小孩老是用披萨盒  把垃圾槽堵住012---...some idiot keeps stuffing the chute with pizza boxes.
那个家伙还是没改012---That guy's still doing that?
天哪  你们回来了  我看看你的手012---Hey. My God, you're here, let me see your hand!
不  来不及了   她已经把垃圾拿去扔了012---No, you're too late! She already took out the trash!
我跟别人分手还没这么平和过012---Wow. I have never had such a healthy breakup.
她表现得好成熟012---She was such a grownup about it.
一点也不幼雅012---She didn't seem too immature for me.
难道我犯了个大错012---Did I just make a huge mistake?
罗斯   等等012---Ross? Wait!
伊丽莎白  太好了   我在想012---Elizabeth, thank God. I was just thinking about--
该死的012---You suck!
什么012---What?
好012---0Kay.
分手还是有效012---Breakup's still on.
她来了012---Okay, okay, Here she comes.
怎么样   我像不像个不想结婚的人012---How do I look? Do I look like a guy who doesn't want to get married?
像012---Yeah.
而且  还有点像法国人012---And, also, a little like a French guy.
我还第一次发现012---I never noticed that before.
大家好   嘿012---Hey, guys. Hey.
你们在干什么012---What are you up to?
瞎混时间   讨论讨论   互联网012---Just hanging out. Talking about, uh, web sites.
是的012---Ha.
有一个讨论婚姻的网站还挺有趣的012---Ahem. We saw this really interesting website about marriage.
说婚姻是多么无用啊012---and how totally unnecessary it is.
说那只不过是政府监视你的方式012---and how it's just a way for governments to keep tabs on you.
是啊   老大哥012---Yeah, Big Brother. Ha, ha.
是有点夸张012---That's a little crazy.
不过我很高兴  你们能在网上了解更多的内容012---Although I am y'know glad to hear that you're branching out on what you look at on the Internet.Yeah, well…
我就想   为什么会有人想要结婚012---Y'know, it just got me thinking though, why would anybody want to get married?
为什么  因为要赞颂彼此的感情  巩固彼此的承诺012---Why? To celebrate the relationship. To solidify the commitment.
要向全世界宣布你们彼此的爱012---To declare your love for one another to the world.
呃012---Eh.
真高兴知道这些012---Okay. Well, that's good to know.
"波芒先生号" 来了012---The Mr. Bowmont's here!
摩妮卡  有位客人想向主厨你致意  让他进来吗012---Hey Monica, there's a customer wants to compliment the chef, Shall I let him in?

进来吧   嘿012---Come on in. Hi.
理查012---Richard.
其实我不是来向主厨致意的012---Actually, I'm not here to compliment the chef.
没关系  我最讨厌客人跑来致意012---Oh. that's okay I hate when people come back to compliment the chef.
好像我很闲似的012---Like I've nothing better to do.
你好吗012---So what's up?
那天晚上遇见你很开心012---Well, it was great seeing you the other night.
我也很开心012---Good to see you too.
你就是来说这个的012---Did you come down here to tell me that?
不是  我是来说其它事的012---No. Came here to tell you something else.
我来想告诉你  我仍然爱着你012---Came here to tell you I still love you.
