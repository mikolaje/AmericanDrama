嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
抱歉迟到了  没错过什么吧012---Sorry I'm late. Did I miss anything?
乔伊在嘴里放了15块奥立奥饼干012---Joey stuffing fifteen Oreos in his mouth.
15片012---Fifteen?
刷新个人纪录哦012---Your personal best! Ha, ha.
你到哪儿去了012---So Where were you?
赴了个约会012---On a date.
我去逛城郊的博物馆  在火车上认识了一个女孩012---I met this girl on a train going to a museum upstate.
哪间博物馆  你是怎么认识她的012---Oh, Which museum? Oh, yeah! How'd you meet her?
不用理我  回答他的问题012---No. Answer his.
好吧  火车后厢就我们两个人012---Okay, it was just me and her at the back of the train,
我的座位靠门  她要换车的话012---and I sat near the door so she'd have to pass by me
就得从我边上过  她拿我没办法012---...if she wanted to switch cars. She was totally at my mercy.
你迟到是因为和她神侃吗012---Were you so late because you were burring this woman?
不是  我赶紧回来了  因为她住在Poughkeepsie（纽约州东南部）012---No, I'm getting back down 'cause she lives in Poughkeepsie.
她看上去真的很不错  住在2个半小时的路程之外012---She seems really great, but she lives two and a half hours away.
都住在Poughkeepsie了  怎么还会很棒012---How can she be great if she's from Poughkeepsie? Ha-ha-ha.
到Albany（纽约州首府）就没笑话可讲了012---That joke would have killed in Albany.
好了  我吃下去了012---Done! I did it!
现在谁才傻啊012---Heh, Who's stupid now?
老友记  第四季  第10集  乱点鸳鸯谱012---Friends S04E10  The one with the girl from Poughkeepsie
嘿  看这个  今晚他们要点亮这棵大圣诞树012---Hey, look at this! They're lighting the big Christmas tree tonight.
那是两周前的报纸012---Um, that paper is two weeks old.
是谁老是把旧报纸  丢在垃圾桶里的012---All right, Who keeps leaving old newspapers in the trash?
我本来想带凯西去看  没想到居然错过了012---I really wanted to take Kathy to this. I can't believe I missed it.
嘿  你至少还有人可以和你一起“错过”机会012---Hey, y'know, at least you have somebody to miss that stuff with!
我已经孤独整整一年了012---I hate being alone this time of year.
接着我又要一个人过情人节012---Next thing it'll be Valentine's Day...
我的生日  然后又是"嗙"012---...then my birthday, then bang!
在你反应过来之前  又是圣诞节了012---before you know it, they're lighting that damn tree again.
噢  我想有人陪012---Ohh, I want somebody!
我要个真正的"男人"012---You know, I want a man!
我是说  哪怕不是正式的交往  而只是"逢场作戏"一次也好012---I mean, it doesn't even have to be a big relationship. y'know, just like a fling would be great.
真的  我还以为女孩子从来不想搞"一夜情"的呢012---Really?! I didn’t think girls ever just wanted a fling.
我告诉你  我很早以前就来过"一夜情"了012---Let me tell you, it's been a long time since I've been flung.
噢  那我知道圣诞节要送你什么了012---Well, I know what I'm giving you for Christmas.
我有几个同事挺不错的  要不要帮你介绍一下012---There are nice guys in my office. Want me to set you up?
好啊012---Yeah.
好啊  等等  我已经单身好久了  你以前为什么不提012---Yeah! Wait a minute, it's been a long time that I've been single. How come you never offered this before?
我现在有女朋友了  很快乐012---Well, I have a girlfriend, I'm-I'm happy.
所以  我不再需要把快乐建筑在他人的痛苦之上了012---So, I no longer feel the need to go out of my way to stop others from being happy.
好012---Okay.
我不要会计师012---No accountants.
也不要律师  我不喜欢工作无聊的男人012---And no one from "legal." I don't like boring jobs.
噢  罗斯工作不无聊吗  他是驯兽师么012---Oh and Ross was like what? A lion tamer?
怎么回事  莫妮012---What's wrong, Mon?
餐馆的所有人都恨我012---Ohh, everybody at the restaurant still hates me.
本来我想我的人缘好起来了012---I thought I was making headway.
大家都冲着我微笑  下班后012---Everyone was smiling at me all day, and then I get off work
才发现他们在我帽子上写了这个012---and find out that they wrote this on my chef's hat.
也许他们想写的是 "婊子  快住嘴"012---Hey, maybe they meant to write, "Quiet, Bitch."
嘿  亲爱的  怎么了012---Hey, honey! What's the matter?
干嘛  火气这么大012---Fine! Just trying to be nice.
从幼儿园后  我就没被这么捉弄过了012---I haven't been picked on this much since kindergarten.
当时他们找了个国中生 来监视我012---And they brought in someone from junior high to do the see-saw with me.
他们想尽办法赶我走012---I mean they're trying to do everything they can to make me quit,
换做是别的工作  我早就不干了012---and if there were any other job, I would.
但是这是我一生都想从事的职业012---This is something I've been waiting for my whole life.
哦  等等  你是老大012---Well, wait a minute, you're the boss.
为什么不吼他们  或干脆炒了他们012---Why don't you just yell at them? Or, fire them?
我也很想这样  可是我做不到  我最不会处理这种冲突012---I would love to, but I can't. you know that I'm not good at confrontation.
嘿  你知道你该怎么办么012---Hey, You know what you can do?
我记得我曾读过一个导演的书  好像是奥森威尔斯 ("公民凯恩"的导演)012---I remember read about this director, I think it was Orson Wells,
他会在电影开拍前  雇一个人012---who at the beginning of the movie would hire somebody,
然后当着大伙的面  解雇他012---just so he could fire them in front of everybody.
这样那些人就会明白  谁才是头儿012---Then they would all know who was boss.
嘿  莫妮卡  反正我没事  你干脆开除我算了012---Hey, Mon! I'm not doing anything, why don't you fire me?
好主意  你知道怎么当服务生吗012---I's a good idea! do you know waiter?
反正你要开除我  管那么多干嘛012---Good enough to get fired.
好  我决定用你了012---All right. You're hired!
嘿012---Hey!
难怪我上个礼拜被开除  奥森威尔斯是不是也掌管汉堡包的生意012---Hey! That must be why I got fired last week! Does this Orson Wells guy direct Burger King commercials?
有012---Yes.
我说的是  德  你现在有没有人约会012---I say, Drew? Are you seeing anybody right now?
哦  我不是在帮我自己问012---Og-ee-op, I'm not asking for me.
我  我  我不是同性恋  我不是想约你012---I’m… I mean… No, I'm-I'm not gay, I'm not asking you out.
我不是同志012---I'm not gay. Okey!
我从不认为你是同性恋012---I didn't think you were gay.
不过现在拿不准了012---I do now.
我朋友瑞秋  希望我帮她介绍个男人012---See my friend-my friend, Rachel, she wants to be set up.
我才刚刚跟前女友分手012---Ahh,I just got out of a big relationship.
我现在不想跟谁交往012---I'm not looking for any thing serious.
你知道么  哪怕是“逢场作戏”都行  没问题的012---Oh, y'know what, that might be okay even if it was just kind of a fling, that might be all right with Rachel.
喔  喔  喔  是不是你曾带到圣诞晚会上的那个 "火辣瑞秋"吗012---Whoa, whoa, whoa. Is this "Hot Rachel" that you took to the Christmas Party? Rachel?
没错  那就是她的全名012---Oh, By the way, that is her full name.
我有空   帮我介绍一下吧012---Wow! I'm free for her.
等等  我又没说我没空012---Oh, wait a second! I didn't say I wasn't free.
嘿  钱德  我们在明天"游骑兵"队的比赛上谈谈这个事呢012---Hey, Chandler, I'll talk so at the Ranger game tomorrow?
打住  我刚得到一盒古巴雪茄012---Hold on. y'know I just got a box of Cubans.
也许我可以拿到你办公室去  5点钟怎么样012---maybe I bring them by your office around uh, five?
这个么  我平常不会待到这么晚  不过可以破个例012---that's uh, a little later than I uh, generally care to stay, but sure!
也许比赛前012---Maybe, before the game
我们可以去享受两瓶8年陈酿的巴素海顿波本012---we can enjoy some eight year old some small batch Basel Hadens.
天晓得那是什么东东  但好吧012---Well, I don't really know what that is, but let's!
嘿  你们几个  我为所有人写了个节日歌  你们想听么012---Hey! You guys, I'm writing a holiday song for everyone. Do you want to hear it?
好啊  好012---Yeah! Yes!
摩妮卡  光明节快乐012---Happy Hanukkah, Monica
乔伊  愿你圣诞节瑞雪纷飞012---May your Christmas be snowy, Joey
钱德  罗斯  新年快乐012---Happy New Year, Chandler and Ross
瑞秋  快来转陀螺012---Spin the dreidel, Rachel
菲比  真好听  太棒了012---Pheebs, that's great! Oh, yay!
但是瑞秋跟陀螺不押韵012---But you know, uh, Rachel doesn't rhyme with dreidel.
我知道  但是你的垃圾名字实在很难找到压韵的词012---I know, but it's so hard. Nothing rhymes with your stupid name!
不会呀  跟瑞秋押韵的字多得很012---What are you talking about? Lots of things rhyme with Rachel:
如贝果  信件  监狱  保释金  第四台…012---Bagel, mail, jail, bail, cable.
五月柱…012---Maypole.
那些都不错  谢了012---All good. Thanks.
你有没有比较容易押韵的外号什么的012---Do you maybe have a nickname that's easier to rhyme?
你爸以前  不是常叫你小南瓜吗012---Didn't your dad call you "Pumpkin"?
对  没错012---Oh, yeah.
Pumpkin  好吧  但他有没有叫过你布道夫012---Pumpkin? Yeah. But did he ever call you "Budolph"?
大家好  嘿012---Hello, children. Hey.
我帮你找了50个候选男人012---Have I got the 50 guys for you!
真的么  我不过把你的照片亮给他们看012---Really? Oh yeah, I just showed this a picture of you and
他们就全都蜂拥而上012---guys were throwing themselves at me!
他们又是请我喝酒  又是送我东西012---They're buying me drinks! They're giving me stuff!
今晚看球赛  当然  座位在哪儿012---Knicks tonight? Sure! Where are the seats?
随你挑  我有20张票012---Wherever! I've got 20.
那么  他们中有没有适合我的012---So, will I like any of these guys?
你知道的  我想再多…012---You know, I'm going to, uh...
观察阵子  钱德012---...play the field a little bit more. Chandler...
他们甚至把401-k（养老基金）受益人都填成我啦012---Guys are signing over their 401 Ks to me.
你的同事都是机器人(不要养老金)啊012---You work with robots?
你说的对012---Yes.
其中有个叫派崔克的小伙  我想你应该会喜欢他012---Yes. Okay, there's this one guy, Patrick, I think you're gonna like him,
他人好  风趣  还是个游泳健将012---He's really nice, funny and a swimmer.
我爱死游泳健将的身材了012---I like swimmers' bodies.
而且他老爸还发明了  信用卡背面的识别磁条012---Yes, and his father invented that magnetic strip on the back of credit cards.
我也爱死信用卡了012---Op, I like credit cards!
你看  这事我办得不错吧012---See, I'm not bad at this fixing up thing, huh?
他是做什么工作的  他在精炼食品部门工作012---Well, so what does he do? Oh, he works in the Fine Foods division.
你公司还做精炼食品  这可是家大公司  如果你  我012---You have a fine foods division? It's a big company,I don't—if you—I…
等等  又做精炼食品又做机器人012---Now, wait a second. You make food and robots?
不是啦  机器人是帮忙工作的012---No, the robots just work for them.
好了  我得上班去了012---All right, I'm going to work.
有人有意见吗012---Does anybody have a problem with that?
是的  小姐  我有意见012---Yeah, lady. I do!
我就是有意见012---I got a problem with that!
你有意见  就别怪我不客气了012---You want a problem? I'll give you a problem!
你想怎样  开除我012---Oh, what are you gonna do? You're gonna fire me?
你个蠢驴  我解雇你了012---You bet your ass I'll fire you!
回头见  谢谢012---See you later. Thank you.
噢  喔  我得走了  今晚有约会012---Oh, wow! I should get going. I-I got a date tonight.
是么  跟谁012---Oh yeah! With who?
还记得那个住在  波放浦夕的女孩吗  记得012---You know that girl I told you about who lives up in Poughkeepsie? Yeah.
不是她012---Not her.
我又认识了一个女孩012---Yeah, this is someone else,
现在左右为难012---and I-I can’t decide between the two of them.
波敔浦夕那个女孩  虽然得坐2小时火车才能看到她  但漂亮012---The one from Poughkeepsie, even though she's a two hour train ride away, is really pretty...
聪明又有趣012---...really smart and a lot of fun.
但另一个女孩  就住在上城区012---But this other girl, well，she lives right uptown.
她也很漂亮012---Y'know she's, well she's-she's just as pretty,
可能也聪明012---I guess she's smart.
但是一点也不风趣012---She's not fun.
一点也不风趣  你为什么还要跟她约会012---she's no fun, why date her at all?
我想再给她一个机会  对吧  她住的这么近012---Well, I-I want to give her a chance. y'know? She lives so close.
而且上次约会的最后  另一次  她曾说了些...012---And, at the end of the date, the other time, she-she said something that...
如果是在开玩笑的话  那她就佷风趣012---if she was kidding, was very funny.
否则她不仅无聊  而且愚蠢  还有种族歧视012---On the other hand, if she wasn't kidding, she's not fun. She's stupid and kind of a racist.
嘿  嘿  伙计012---Hey. Hey. Hey, man!
第一天在餐厅工作  情况如何012---Hey! Ooh, How was your first day working at the restaurant?
可恶012---Damn!
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
你的制服怎么了012---What happened to your fancy chef's jacket?
被他们烤了012---They baked it.
我再也受不了了012---I can't take this anymore.
今晚要开个会  然后解雇你  没问题012---I'm gonna call a meeting tonight, I'm gonna fire you tonight.You got it. Oh, oh!
你在干嘛012---What are you doing?
你衣服上还有火星012---It's still a tiny bit on fire there.
谢谢  你应该已经拍灭了吧012---Thanks. I think you got it!
钱德  你对男人的品味一流012---Chandler, you have the best taste in men.
有其父必有其子012---Well, Like father, like son.
派崔克和我昨晚玩得好开心012---Patrick and I had such a great time last night!
说不定能发展出一段  认真的感情012---I mean I think this could maybe turn into something serious.
是么  好像不是想要跟谁交往的呀  你只想“放荡”一下012---Really?! I-I thought you weren't looking for something serious? I thought you were looking for some kind of a fling.
噢  好像是这样012---Well, you know, possibly.
你没告诉他吧012---You didn't tell him that, though, right?
没有  我已经说了012---Ummmmmmmm, no.
你告诉他我只是想搞"一夜情"012---You told this guy that I was looking for a fling?
你怎么能告诉他012---You don't tell the guy that!
为什么不行  如果我知道那个火辣的女孩想要  我会兴奋得发抖…012---Why not?I'd be thrilled if I heard that some hot girl was just looking to get
噢  我明白了012---I see.
你告诉他我想“一夜情”012---Oh, between you telling him that I wanted to have a fling
而我想跟他长期交往012---and me putting out on the first date
他一定会误会的012---oh, he's so gonna get the wrong idea.
乔伊  把芝士递过来么012---Hey, Joey, could you pass the cheese?
好的  我想你还是别叫我乔伊012---Yeah. Listen uh, I'd prefer you didn't call me Joey.
因为这没人认识我  所以我想帮自己取了个超炫的外号012---Since I don't know anyone here, I thought it'd be cool to try out a cool work nickname.
嘿  龙哥012---Hey, Dragon!
这是你周一和周二2天赚的小费012---Here's your tips from Monday and Tuesday.
天啊  有三百块耶012---There's like-there's like 300 bucks in this one!
过节时客人总是特别大方012---Yeah, People get generous around the holidays.
穿紧身裤的效果更是很棒012---And it never hurts to wear tight trousers.
请服务生集合一下  交代一下今晚的特价菜012---Okay. Could the waiters gather around to hear tonight's specials?
首先是用芒果佐味的智利黑鲈012---Okay, first there's Chilean sea bass with a mango relish on a bag
你们为什么没人用笔记一下012---Why is nobody writing these down?
因为我们能记住012---We can remember them.
因为你们这样就能象以前一样随口捏造假的特价菜  然后让我来弄012---Because you'll make up fake specials and make me cook them like you did the other night?
哦  没错  也有这个原因012---Well, Sure, that too.
好吧  先把特价菜放到一边  是这样的…012---Okay, Forget the specials for a minute. Umm, all right here's the thing...
过去两周里  我试着想012---For the last two weeks I have, uh...
努力营造一个愉快的工作环境012---...tried hard to create a positive atmosphere.
听不到012---Can't hear you!
愉快的工作环境012---positive atmosphere!
但是现在我对此不抱希望了012---But I've had it up to here.
从现在开始  要么按我说得去做012---From now on, it is going to be my way
要么就滚蛋012---...or the highway. All right?
有人有意见吗012---Does anybody have a problem with that?
嘿  新来的012---Hey, new guy.
我说有人有意见吗012---I said, does anybody have a problem with that?
没有012---No, ma'am.
嘿  他有名字  他叫龙哥012---Hey! He has a name. It's Dragon.
想知道你的名字吗  看看你的帽子012---You want to know your name? Check your hat.
我们写在上面了  是吧012---We did the hat, right?
刚刚那是怎么回事  真的很抱歉012---What the hell just happened? I am so-so-so sorry.
我真的很想配合你012---I was going to do it.Really!
但我一手拿着327块012---But I was standing there with $327 in one hand...
另一手拿着238块 我在想...012---...and $238 in the other. And I was thinking...
我很久没拿到…012---"Wow! It's been a long time since I had…
327块加238块  这么多钱了012---...327 plus $238!
乔伊  我们说好的  我用你就是为了开除你012---Joey, We had a deal! That-that's why you're here. I've got to fire you!
但是我要付房租的012---And I got to pay rent!
这样吧  你别开除我012---how-how about this? You don't fire me,
我留在这里争取他们的信任012---instead I stay here, I gain their trust.
我说你的好话  他们就听得进去了012---and they'll start listening to all the nice things I've been saying about you.
什么好话012---What nice things?
还没有  他们恨死你了 我想跟他们打成一片012---Well Nothing yet. they really hate you and I want to fit in.
钱德  摩妮卡  光明节快乐  圣诞012---Happy Hanukkah, Chandler and Monica, Merry, merry...
菲比  你知道吗012---Oh, y'know, y'know what Pheebs?
我不是犹太人  所以...012---I'm not Jewish so...
罗斯也没有用绒毛装饰他的圣诞树012---So! Ross doesn't really decorate his tree with floss,
他有没有跟你抱怨过  天啊012---but you don't hear him complaining do you? God!
做恶梦啦012---Bad dream?
我根本没睡着012---I wasn't sleeping.
是吗  那菲比刚刚在唱什么歌012---Oh yeah, then uh, what was Phoebe's song about?
关于小猫什么的012---The one with the cat.
我得走了  又有约会012---I got to go. I've got another date.
那么  你选谁了012---So, did you pick one yet?
没有  现在反而城里的那个女孩开始讲笑话012---No, it turns out the one from uptown was making a joke.
但是我根本不懂她的笑话  而且没那么好笑012---But it was a different joke than I thought—it wasn't that funny.
我还是两头跑  左右为难012---So I'm still torn.
你看  你根本不喜欢城里的那个女孩012---Well look, you don't really like the one from uptown
为了跟波敔浦夕妞约会  累得疲惫不堪012---and you're too exhausted from dating the one up in Poughkeepsie,
所以跟他们两个都分手  怎么样012---so I say you just end them both. Okay?
坐火车去波敔浦夕跟她分手012---You take a train up to Poughkeepsie and break up with her,
然后回来的路上跟城里的那个姑娘也分手012---and on your way back you break up with uptown.
到家时一切都解决了  搞定012---And then by the time you get home tonight, you're done!
对  你说得对  谢谢012---Y'know, You're right. Thank you.
我在布拉格也碰到过这种问题012---Umm, well I had a similar problem when I lived in Prague.
布拉格  还有很多事你不知道呢012---Prague? So much you don't know.
钱德012---Chandler?
派崔克刚刚跟我分手了012---Patrick just, uh, ended things with me.
你有没有告诉他  我想认真谈段感情012---Did you or did you not tell him that I was looking for a serious relationship?
我说了  当然说了012---I did! I absolutely did!
你个白痴012---You idiot!
我知道你说得对  但是  为什么012---I'm sure you're right. But why?
你不该告诉他我要谈段认真的感情  你不该告诉他的012---You don't tell a guy that you're looking for a serious relationship! You don't tell the guy that!
你看  把他吓跑了012---Now you scared him away!
噢  伙计  我非常遗憾  我非常非常遗憾012---Oh, man. I'm sorry, I'm so-so sorry.
应该禁止你跟别人说话012---Y'know, You should never be allowed to talk to people!
我知道  没错012---I know, I know!
噢  我又回到起点了012---Oh! See just I'm now right back where I started!
超难过012---Aww, this sucks!
孤孤单单的真难过012---Being alone sucks!
呃  你知道  你迟早会遇见意中人012---Well, y'know, you're-you're gonna meet somebody!
你是个好对象012---You're a great catch!
你知道么  我跟同事形容你时  根本不需要美化你012---Y'know when I was telling all those guys about you, I didn't have to lie once.
真的吗  真的012---Really? Yeah.
你是从Magma Ku Laude毕业的  是吧012---You graduated magna cum laude, right?
