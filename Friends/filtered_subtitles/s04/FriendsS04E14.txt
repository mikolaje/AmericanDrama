我待在湖上  整整三天没洗澡012---Yeah, three days on the lake without a shower.

约书亚约我今晚去一家刚开业的高级夜总会012---Joshua invited me to this fancy club opening tonight.
可我已经答应沃森先生012---But I already told Mr. Waltham...
带他的侄女去看什么破歌剧012---...that I would take his niece to the dumb old opera.
唉  怎么办呢012---So, what are you gonna do?
我也不知道  亲爱的  不行  帮帮我012---I don't know, sweetie. No. Help me.
我不行  我要上班  菲比012---I can't. I have to work. Phoebe?
我倒是很想  可我晚上有妊娠反应012---I would, but I get my morning sickness in the evening.
除非  她想整晚上都过不安生012---Ooh, no, unless she wants to spend the night holding my hair back for me.
拜托  天哪  你们  我一定要去见约书亚012---Ugh. Gosh, you guys, come on. This is... I have to meet Joshua.
这是唯一的机会  让他看看有趣的瑞秋012---This is my one chance for him to see the fun Rachel.
也许 他会想 "要是瑞秋是我老婆该多好呀"012---You know, the "Wouldn't it be great if she were my wife?" Rachel.
算了  乔伊和钱德回来了吗012---Ohh, all right! Are Joey and Chandler back?
没有  钱德还在第一阶段  乔伊身上的味道你总该闻见了吧012---Oh, Chandler's still in phase one, and Joey's that thing you smell.

你要我带一个不认识的女生  去看歌剧012---You want me to take some girl I've never met to the opera...
好让你去夜总会  跟某个男人打情骂俏012---...so you can go to a club and flirt with some guy?
真难决定啊012---Hmm. Yeah, that is a toughie.
她在四处张望012---Oh, she's looking down the hall.
她在看我012---Oh! She looked right at me.
等等  这洞从外面看不进来  对吧012---Oh, wait, you can't see people through that little hole, can you?
你好啊012---Hello.
你好012---Hello? Aah!
我马上出来  罗斯  拜托啦  帮帮忙吧012---Oh, I'll be right there. Okay, Ross, please. Come on.
我以为我们之间的事都过去了012---I thought we had moved on.
我以为我们可以彼此相互祝福了012---I thought we'd gotten to a place where we could be happy for each other.
难道只是我这样想么012---I mean was that just me?
好吧  我答应你  谢谢你  谢谢你  谢谢你012---All right, I'll do it. Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you.
艾蜜莉  是012---Emily? Yes.
我是瑞秋葛林  谢天谢地012---I'm Rachel Green. Thank goodness.
计划有小小的变动  我晚上没空  所以…012---There's been a teeny-teeny change in plans. It turns out that I'm not free tonight. So…
是吗012---Really? Heh.
真是太巧了  不是么  我一定是没接到你的电话  虽然我整天都没出门012---Well, that's just lovely, isn't it? I must've missed your call, even though I didn't leave the flat all day.
不  其实我  不  不  不  还算好啦012---Well, no, I... No, no, no, that's not rude.
我这一路上012---It's perfectly in keeping with a trip...
差点儿被你们热狗车撞倒012---...where I've already been run down by one of your wiener carts...
在约翰F肯尼迪机场  又被脱衣搜身012---...and been strip-searched at John F. Kennedy Airport.
显然  我长得就像012---Apparently, I look like someone...
屁股里塞满了可卡因012---...who's got a balloon full of cocaine stuffed up their bum.
我-我-我觉得你很漂亮啊012---I-I-I think you look great.
再见  很高兴认识你们012---Good night. It was very nice to meet you all.
我去追她012---I'll get her.
快去  好012---Please hurry. Okay.
他们讲话好好玩012---Don't you just love the way they talk?
怎么了  踢我了  孩子踢我了012---What? It kicked. I think the baby kicked.
天啊  上帝呀  噢012---Oh, my God. Ha, ha.
不对  是内裤的松紧带断了012---Oh, no, wait. Oh. That was the elastic in my underwear busted.
完了  我睡过头了012---Oh, my God. I overslept.
通告是半小时前就要到场的  我得赶快012---I was supposed to be on the set a half an hour ago. I gotta get out of here.
你不能这样出去吧  你好臭012---What? Joey, you can't go like that. You stink.
没办法啊  我还没洗澡就睡着了  现在没时间了012---Look, I know I feel asleep before I could shower and now I don't have time!
才十条街  用跑的还来得及012---They're 10 blocks away. If I run, I can make it.
那是  跑10个街区  你会更臭了012---Yeah, run 10 blocks. That'll help the smell.
慢一点  算了  快跑012---Hey. Whoa! Slow down. No, keep moving. Whoa.
昨晚怎么样啊  我没见到约书亚012---So how did it go with Joshua last night? Oh. Well, I didn't see Joshua.
但我揍了一个女生一拳012---But I did punch a girl in the face.
什么   为什么012---What? Why?
昨晚真的很倒楣   倾盆大雨012---The whole night was horrible. It was pouring rain.
到了现场  名单上没有瑞秋葛林  只有瑞秋葛皮012---and when I got there, there was no Rachel Green on the list, but there was a Rachel Greep.
那你见到她了么012---Oh. So did you get to meet her?
没有  根本没这个人  但有个女生听到了012---No, there is no Rachel Greep. But then this other girl overheard us.
大声嚷嚷 "我就是瑞秋葛皮  我就是"  结果她就进去了012---And she was all, "I'm Rachel Greep, I'm Rachel Greep," and he let her in.
然后你就朝她脸上打了一拳  没有  她已经进去了012---So you hit her in the face? No, she was already in.
不过后面有个肥婆想偷我的伞012---But then this big bitch behind me tried to steal my umbrella...
被我一拳揍在脸上012---...so I clocked her.
我真不敢相信012---Ugh. I can't believe this.
我只是想在下班后  跟约书亚相处一下012---All I wanted was just a few hours outside of work to see Joshua...
好让他有机会爱上我012---...so that he could go ahead and start falling in love with me.
菲比012---Aw. Pheebs.
亲爱的  那是你的名字012---Honey, that's your name.
我以为那是我们之间的昵称012---That's short for Phoebe? I thought that's what we called each other.
你穿上裤子了  没错012---Hey, you're wearing pants. That's right.
男人们都到哪里去了  我准备好了 要买醉看脱衣舞012---Where are the guys? I'm ready to get drunk and see strippers.
才早上9点半  他们那里有自助早餐的012---It's 9:30 in the morning. They got a breakfast buffet.
喂  罗斯  让我跟他说012---Hello? Oh, hey, Ross. Ooh. Let me talk to him.
天哪012---Oh, my God.
我能不能  等等  什么012---Can't I just...? Shh. Wait, what?
我的电话  她还嘘我  别吵啦012---It's my phone and she's shush... Shh. Please.
他说什么012---What's he saying?
他跟艾蜜莉在佛蒙特的一个旅馆012---He's with Emily at a bed and breakfast in Vermont.
什么  哦  天哪012---What? Oh, my God.
艾蜜莉是谁  不会吧012---What? Who the hell is Emily? Noooo!!
他们在佛蒙特  怎么会这样012---They're in Vermont? How did this happen?
嗷012---Ow.
他怎么会跟那个巫婆去佛蒙特012---How—How did he end up in Vermont with that awful witch?
也许她没有一直打他吧012---Maybe she doesn't hit him all the time.
我们见到她时…012---When we first met her...
她湿透了  连脚都是湿的012---...she was soaking, her feet were wet.
谁能比她更可怜012---Who wouldn't be miserable?
是真的  我给她换了双鞋后  她完全变了个人012---I'm telling you when I got her into a dry pair of shoes, she was a totally different person.
罗斯  快来  外面有只驯鹿在吃果园的水果012---Ross, come quickly. There's a deer outside eating fruit from the orchard.
我要挂了  外面有只驯鹿在吃果园的水果012---I gotta go! There's a deer outside eating fruit from the orchard!
他挂了  外面有只驯鹿在吃果园的水果012---He had to go, there's a deer just outside eating fruit from the orchard.
真想不通   她那么讨厌012---I don't get this. She was horrible.
我要去站在那边012---Okay, I'm gonna go stand over there.
你干嘛这么在乎  我才不在乎012---Why do you care so much, anyway? I don't care.
我只是有点儿心烦  我跟约书亚没任何进展012---You know what? I'm just upset that I'm getting nowhere with Joshua.
但哪有人刚认识  就跑去佛蒙特鬼混的012---Know what? Still, you do not just meet someone and go flitting off to Vermont.
你和贝瑞一认识就飞到维尔去了012---Well, when you first met Barry, you flitted off to Vail.
你能不能偶尔有一次  不要记得这些琐碎小事012---Ugh. You know, could you just for once not remember every little thing?
你知道他什么时候回来么012---So, you know, when's he getting back?
几天后吧  我就知道会这样012---A couple of days. Know what? I knew something like this was gonna happen.
你干什么012---What are you doing?
钱德  你不能让阶段倒流012---Chandler. You can't just go back a phase.
可以  你说的是时间  你不能让时光倒流012---Yes, you can. You're thinking about time. You can't go back in time.
你为什么不  不继续你的第二阶段呢012---Why don't you just...? Why don't you do your phase-two strip-club thing with us?
对呀  来吧  我们可以当男生  不  你们不行012---Yeah, come on, we can be guys. Heh. No, you can't.
怎么了  不就是扮男的嘛  也许我们本来就想当012---Come on, let us be guys. Maybe we wanna be guys.
你们才不会想当男的012---You don't wanna be guys.
男人浑身是毛  而且短命012---You'd be all hairy and you wouldn't live as long.
你  你012---You know, you...
你别再唧唧歪歪了  把运动裤脱了012---Would you just stop being such a wuss and get those off?
跟我们去看裸女跳舞012---And you come with us and watch naked girls dance around.
好012---Okay.
对不起012---I'm sorry.
我是乔伊崔比亚尼  我来了 我来了012---Hey, Joey Tribbiani. I'm here, I'm here.
别急  来得及  进度有点落后012---Calm down, we got time. We're running a little late.
准备好了012---All set.
你看  却尔登希斯顿在嚼甘草012---Look at that. Charlton Heston eating a licorice whip.
他很爱嚼甘草  我从没见过他…012---Yeah, he loves them. I've never seen him with...
哇  这儿怎么了  什么东西这么臭012---Whoa. Yeah. What the hell is that? What smells so bad?
是你012---You. Oh.
难怪你会这么想  你知道实际上我怎么想的吗012---I could see why you would think that. But actually, you know who I think it is?
你么  不  是希斯顿012---You? No, no. It's Heston.
什么  就是他身上的臭012---What? The man reeks.
闻起来像是去钓了三天的鱼  现在还嚼甘草012---Smells like he went on a three-day fishing trip and then ate licorice. Ick.
不可能是他呀012---There's no way he smells.
只有他的休息室有浴室012---He's the only one around here with a shower in his dressing room.
真的  浴室  嗯  是哪间012---Really? A shower, huh? And, uh, which room might that be?
门口有写 "希斯顿"的那间012---The one with "Heston" on it.
有意思012---Interesting.
我换了零钞  你要不要去放到她的小裤裤里啊012---Hey. I got some ones. You wanna put them in her panties?
不用了  谢谢  老妈012---No, thanks, Mom.
啊  哦  别  那个012---Oh. No. Um, hi. That, that.
抱歉  你得把烟掐掉  我怀孕了012---You have to put that out because I'm pregnant, so...
也许你和你的孩子应该去别家脱衣舞夜总会了012---Well, maybe you and your baby ought to go to another strip club.
呵-呵  这不是我的孩子  呵-呵-呵012---Heh, heh. It's not my baby. Heh, heh.
很好  很好012---Very good. Yes. That was so good.
太棒了  我喜欢  很火辣012---Really, really enjoyed it. Very exotic.
我查过留言  约书亚没打来过012---Well, I just checked our messages, and Joshua didn't call.
我还以为我没去他的夜总会  他会担心呢012---I mean you'd think he'd be worried about me not showing up at his club.
更糟的是  罗斯还在佛蒙特风流快活012---Ugh. And you know what makes it worse? Ross is all happy in Vermont.
拜托  你在看脱衣舞啊012---Come on, look where you are.
麻烦给我们每人一杯鸡尾酒  别忘了  我还要个处男012---When you get a sec, another round of daiquiris.Remember, virgin for me, please.
记得提醒我  问那个帅哥的名字012---Oh, and don't let me leave without getting the name of that carpet guy.
拜托012---Oh, come on.
算了  我这就回家给凯西打电话012---You know what? I'm just gonna go home and call Kathy.
如果有用的话  不  我只是试试012---Well, if you think it'll help. No. That was a test.
再过几小时  我就会烂醉如泥  想打给凯西012---In a couple hours, I'm gonna get drunk and wanna call Kathy...
你们得阻止我呀012---...and you have to stop me.
然后我醉的一塌糊涂了  说不定还会给珍妮丝打电话012---Then I'm gonna be so drunk, I'm gonna wanna call Janice.
你是该打  她好吗012---You should. How is she? Oh!
我想有人肯定会觉得表演还不够过瘾012---I think somebody needs another lap dance.
哈罗  谁在里面012---Hello? Who's in there?
你好吗012---How you doing?
你到底是谁012---Who in the hell are you?
我说寇克道格拉斯  你不会信吧012---Uh, guess you wouldn't believe me if I said I was Kirk Douglas, huh?
把裤子穿上  我好踢你屁股012---Put some pants on, kid, so I can kick your butt.
不  等等  你有所不知012---No, no, no, wait. You don't understand.
我是个演员012---You see, I'm an actor.
乔伊崔比亚尼  今天跟你有一场戏012---Joey Tribbiani. I'm doing a scene with you today.
但是我很臭（演得很烂）012---And, well, I stink.
你有演这部片  对  对012---You're in this picture? Yeah, yeah.
我演不肯跟你合作的警察  因为你的倔脾气012---I'm one of the cops who won't work with you because you're a loose cannon.
总之  我很抱歉  但我真的很臭（演得很烂）012---Anyway, look, I'm really sorry, but I just... I stink.
乔伊  是吧  对012---Joey, right? Yeah.
每个演员或多或少…012---Every actor, one time or another... Ah.
都会觉得自己很臭012---Every actor thinks he stinks.
连劳伦斯奥立佛  有时也会这么想012---Even Laurence Olivier sometimes thought he stank.
劳勃瑞福甚至都不敢正眼瞧自个儿  不  不  不  你没明白我012---Bob Redford won't even watch himself. No, no, no, you don't understand.
听我说  是  好的012---Listen to me. No... Yeah.
我就不相信任何一个称职的演员012---I don't know one actor worth his salt...
在演艺生涯中都不曾说过 "天哪  我真的太臭了"012---...who one time in his career didn't say, "God, I stink."
