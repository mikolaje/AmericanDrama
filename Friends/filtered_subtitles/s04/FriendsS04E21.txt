要是我死了  大家只会从这张椅子的屁股印上012---If I died, the only way people would know I was here...
知道我存在过012---...would be by the ass print on this chair.
我们得有所作为  做一件大事012---Look, we have to do something. Okay? Something huge.
我们可以去爬圣母峰 (珠穆朗玛峰)012---We could climb Mount Everest.

只不过很陡012---It's just steep.
对012---Yeah.
我们去攻顶  在山顶留屁股印一定很爽012---We're going to Everest. Okay? It'd be nice to leave an ass print on Everest.

那个圣母峰录影带只能邮购012---That Everest thing is only available through mail order.
这样啊012---Oh, well.

对啊  对啊012---Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
不过我要告诉你  总有一天012---But I'll tell you something. one of these days...

你以为看你们在一起很好受吗012---You think it's easy for me to see you with Julie?
问题的重点是我不想要这样012---Well, the point is I don't need this right now.
好吗  来不及了012---Okay? It's too late.
我有别人了  我很快乐  这艘船已经开了012---I'm with somebody else. I'm happy. This ship has sailed.

去吃点冷冻优格什么的012---Let's get some frozen yogurt or something.

当然可以012---Yes, you can very much.
你给我走  滚  不要  不012---I want you to leave. Get outta here! No. No.
我想留下来  我想留下来谈一谈012---I wanna stay. I wanna talk about this.
好  她功夫如何012---Okay! All right. How was she?
什么  她厉害吗012---What? Was she good?
不要回答012---Don't answer that.
你说你想谈  那就谈啊  她功夫怎么样啊012---You said you wanted to talk about it. Let's talk about it. How was she?
她…012---She was...
很差  什么也比不上你  不好012---Awful. She was not good, not good.
不能跟你比012---Nothing compared to you.
她不一样012---She was different.
好的  还不一样012---Good different?
没有人喜欢改变012---Nobody likes change.
别再说了012---Oh! Just stop.
你这么坦然认错012---The way you owned up to everything...
证明你真的成长了不少012---...it just showed me how much you've grown, you know?
我妈一直觉得我们无法复合012---I mean, my mom never thought this would work out.
她说  "出轨一次  就会有第二次 "012---She was all, "Once a cheater, always a cheater."
真希望没有这四个月的空白012---I just wish we hadn't lost those four months.
但要是时间能让你看清楚一点012---But if time was what you needed just to gain a little perspective...
我们当时分手了012---We were on a break!
你似乎真的很喜欢她012---You seem to really like her.
我能怎么办  我们说好只在一起两周012---Yeah, but what am I gonna do? We both agreed that it was gonna be a two-week thing,
不要有承诺012---You know? No commitment.
罗斯  那个女孩整晚都跟你的朋友012---Ross, that girl just spent the entire evening talking to your friends...
嚷着要听你的事012---...asking to hear stories about you...
还看摩妮卡的相册012---...looking through Monica's photo albums.
如果你只想在一起两周  你才不会这么做012---I mean, you don't do that if you're just in it for two weeks.
你这么想012---You think? Heh.
她还有14个小时才要去机场012---You've got like 14 hours until she has to be at the airport.
你却坐在走廊上012---And you're sitting here in a hallway...
陪着一个28岁  嘴肿起来的老啦啦队长浪费时间012---...with a 28-year-old cheerleader with a fat lip.
你说得对  对012---Yeah, you're right. Yeah.

太浪漫了012---It's so romantic.
想得真周到012---Hey, pretty smart.
还有面巾纸012---Tissue paper.
参加婚礼  当然会哭012---You're at the wedding. You have to cry.
需要手帕吗  不  我有喜帖012---Handkerchief? No, I got my invitation.
看啊  真可爱012---Oh, look, isn't this adorable?
罗斯让班写给我的信封012---Ross let Ben address mine.
哈罗  嘿012---Hello. Hey.
嘿   嘿012---Hey. Hey.
你收到罗斯的婚礼喜帖了吗012---Hey, did you get your invitation to Ross' wedding?
没收到012---No.

太嫉妒了  你们都要去012---I'm so jealous you're all going.
怀孕九个月居然不能坐飞机012---I can't believe I never knew you can't fly in your third trimester.
从来都不知道  我也不知道012---I never knew that. I didn't, either.
我知道012---I knew that.
我也不知道  但你们的表情太喜感了012---So didn't know that. But you should see your faces.
嗨  你们在干嘛  嘿012---Hi, guys. What's up?
也没干嘛012---We're hanging out.
这是什么  罗斯的喜帖012---What's this? Is this Ross' wedding invitation?
也许该藏的是那一张012---Maybe that's the one we should have actually hidden.
不  不  不必那样012---Oh, no. No, you guys, come on. You don't have to do that.
我替他高兴啊012---I'm happy for him.
真的  我  我很…012---I am. I really... I'm... I'm ha...
我会调节的012---I'll work on it.
对不起  甜心012---I'm sorry, honey.
瑞秋  你会去吧012---Rach, you're going to come though, aren't you?
喔  甜心  我不知道012---Oh, honey, I don't know. I...
该不会  "她不去  我们就不去吧"012---This isn't one of those "If she doesn't come, we don't come"?
我已经买票了012---Because I already bought my ticket...
你不去才会真的很奇怪012---You know what would be real weird? If you weren't there.
你就考虑下吧  我会的  我会考虑的012---Just say you'll think about it, okay? No, I'll think about it. Yeah.
这是谁送的  罗斯送的012---Who's this from? That's Ross'.

记得什么012---Remembered what?
好几个月前  我们经过一家古董店012---It was like months ago. We were walking by this antique store.
我看到这个别针  对他说  小时候我奶奶012---I saw this pin, and I told him it was just like one my grandmother had...
有一个一模一样的012---...when I was a little girl. Oh.
他居然记得012---I can't believe he remembered.
他肯定花了不少钱012---This must have cost him a fortune.
他居然这么大方012---I can't believe he did this.
罗斯 记得他大学爱上卡萝时012---Ross? Remember back in college when he fell in love with Carol...
就送了她一只超贵的水晶鸭012---...and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck?
你刚才在说什么012---What did you just say?
我的天哪012---Oh, my God.
来自北京的457号班机  刚刚抵达012---Flight number 457 from Beijing now arriving.

我很替你和你的猫012---And I'm really happy for you...
高兴012---...and your cat.
所以很显然  我已经放下你了012---So obviously, I am over you.
我已经放下你了012---I am over you.
而那样的话  我的朋友  就叫了结012---And that, my friend, is what they call closure.

我跟复印店女生的事吧012---...about me and the girl from the copy place.
对不起012---I'm sorry.
我不该说吗012---Was I not supposed to?
是你要分手的  记得吗012---You're the one who ended it.
因为我很气你  不是因为我不爱你了012---Yeah, because I was mad at you. Not because I stopped loving you.
你还爱我012---You still love me?
没有012---No.
什么意思  你想复合吗012---What does this mean? What do you...? I mean, do you want to get back together?

我只是觉得012---I just... I feel...
我居然会想跟你复合  我们根本就完了012---I can't believe I even thought of getting back together with you. We are so over.
无所谓012---Fine by me!
顺便告诉你  这种事并不常见012---And, hey, just so you know, it's not that common...
并非男人都会这样  这是很严重的012---...it doesn't happen to every guy, and it is a big deal!
我就知道012---I knew it!
瑞秋来了  她是不是很美啊012---Rachel's coming up. Doesn't she look pretty, Jack?
天哪012---Oh, my God.

我有个好主意012---I have a wonderful idea.
你带瑞秋去参加舞会012---You should take Rachel to the prom.
看够了  关掉吧012---We've seen enough. Let's turn it off.

看吧  他是她的龙虾012---See? He's her lobster.
不会吧012---No.
你真的不去  对012---You're really not going? Yeah.
我会很难面对012---It's just going to be too hard.
毕竟012---You know, I mean...
他是罗斯012---...it's Ross.
我怎么能看着他结婚012---How can I watch him get married?
这样最好  真的012---You know? It's just for the best, you know? It is.
而且总得有人陪菲比012---Plus somebody's got to stay here with Phoebe.
