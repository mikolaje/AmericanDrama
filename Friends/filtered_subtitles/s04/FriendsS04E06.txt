是的  你拿出帐单前她根本没哭012---Well, it seems like there weren't any tears 'til you showed her the bill.
菲比  她的声音真的让我难受012---Phoebe, she sounded pretty upset to me.
她现在看上去似乎没事了012---She seems fine now.
那么  你真的就走了  她家就真的那么脏012---So you just left? Her place was really that bad?
你知道  下班回家会把夹克扔到椅子上012---You know how you throw your jacket on a chair at the end of the day?
就象这样  在她家是扔到一堆垃圾上012---Well, like that, only instead of a chair, it's a pile of garbage.
那也不是夹克  是一堆垃圾012---And instead of a jacket, it's a pile of garbage.
也不是下班回家   简直是世界末日012---And instead of the end of the day, it's the end of time...
幸存的只有垃圾012---...and garbage is all that has survived.
拿去  谢了012---Here. Wow. Thanks.
然后呢012---So, uh, what happened?
哪有然后  我逃之天夭012---What do you mean? Nothing happened! I had to get out of there.
好  下次  你就带她去你家012---All right, so... next time, you take her to your place.
不  我试过了  她说我家有怪味012---No, I tried that. She says it has a weird smell.

好  听着  你喜欢她  对么  对012---All right, listen, Ross... you like this girl, right? Yeah.
你想再跟她见面  对么012---You wanna see her again, right?
那你就得在垃圾里跟她做012---So you're gonna have to do it in the mess!
好吧   你说得对012---Yeah, okay. You're right.
我是说  稍微乱一点  谁又在乎一点脏东西012---I mean, uh, who... who cares about a little sloppiness?
其实蛮可爱的  真的  那就好012---It's, uh... it's endearing, really. All right!
现在就去找这头漂亮的猪012---Now you go get that beautiful pig!
好  我花了一下午替凯西找了一件012---Okay, all right. I just spent the entire afternoon looking for a present...
比这只兔子好的礼物012---...for Kathy that would be better than the rabbit.
找到了吗012---Any luck?
有  我找到一家店  叫"送给凯西的隐形礼物"012---Oh, yeah. Yeah, I found this great place called "Invisible things for Kathy."
你能不能帮我一把012---Can you give me a hand with all this stuff?
好  这样  你为什么不退掉这本书  让乔伊送她那支时钟笔012---All right, look. Why don't you just return the book, let Joey give her the clock pen...
你送个更差的东西  比如…012---...and you get her something worse than that...
一支普通的笔012---...like a regular pen.
她真的会喜欢这个  你知道012---She's really going to love this, you know?
重要的是把这个送给她012---The bottom line is I want her to have it...
即使她不知道是谁送的012---...even if I don't get to be the one who gives it to her.
啊  亲爱的  好感人啊012---Aw, honey, that's so sweet.
你不觉得很可悲吗012---Yeah? You don't think it's just pathetic?

是一本书012---It's a book.
书012---A book?
是书也是保险盒012---Is it a book that's also a safe?
它就是一本书012---No, it's a book that's just a book, okay?

没问题012---You got it.
谢谢你  我欠你一次012---Thanks man. Thanks for doing this. I owe you one.
给你的20块没有找钱  是吧012---Oh, hey! There wasn't any change from that twenty, was there?
没有  不只20块呢012---No, it came out to an even twenty.
哇  跟新书差不多贵012---Wow. That's almost as much as a new book.
还是没要到  对吧012---You didn't get the money, did you?
也许我该在间断的时候去012---Maybe I can try at intermission?
菲比  拜托  你知道  我们就走吧012---Phoebe, come on... you know what? Let's just go!
不行  钱没拿到不能走012---No! Hey, we're not leaving until we get paid!

但我们提供了服务  就该得到报酬012---Um, but we provided a service, and we deserve to be paid...
因为你们吃都吃了012---...because you ate that service.
钱没付清之前  我们不会走的012---and, um, we are not leaving here until we're paid every penny. ...
知道为什么吗  女士  我们只是临时承包  没别的地方可以去012---'Cause you know what, lady? We're part time caterers, and we have no place else to go.
好  我去拿皮包012---All right. I'll get my bag.
