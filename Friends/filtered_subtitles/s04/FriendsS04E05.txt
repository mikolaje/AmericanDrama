贾许穿你的皮衣  看起来好帅012---I just saw Josh. He looked so yummy in your leather jacket.
来  我不吃鸡  所以只有汤012---Here, now I don't eat chicken, so it's just noodle soup.
熬汤时又没放鸡  跟水没什么两样012---And there's no chicken in the broth either, so it's really just... noodle water.
谢谢你菲比  当然012---Thank you so much Phoebe. Sure.

她不是我的型012---She's not really my type.
不是你的型  大美女啊012---Not your type? She's gorgeous.
知道吗  因为她穿网袜012---You know what I think it is? It's the fishnet stockings.
看到女生穿网袜  我就想到...012---Whenever I see a girl in fishnet stockings it reminds me of...
我爸穿网袜的样子012---my father in fishnet stockings.
我有点了解  你为何单身了012---Okay. Understanding a little more why you're single.
我有个很漂亮的朋友  可以一起约会012---I have a friend you would like, she's really pretty. And then we could double date!
不必了012---No, thanks.
我也有几个丑朋友   没有对象012---Okay, I've got some ugly friends, and they're all available too.
我去叫酒012---Listen, I-I'm gonna grab a beer.
马上回来012---I'll be right back.
你什么意思  什么012---What was that? What?
凯西在示好  你却掉头就走012---Kathy was being really nice and you just walked away. I thought we had a deal.
你要我怎样012---Hey, look, what do you want from me?
我要你喜欢她012---I want you to like her.
要是太难了  你起码可以装一下012---But if that's too damned difficult for you, then the least you can do is pretend.
我正在装啊  再像一点012---I am pretending. Then do it better.
不如我过去说  很喜欢她012---Okay, what do you saw I go over there and say how much I like her?
不  我可以说我一直在想她012---No-no it'll be good, I can tell her much I've been thinking about her.
认识以后  我就一直想着她012---That I haven't stopped thinking about her since the moment I met her.
我无可救药  简直想掐死自己012---That I'm so fantastically, over-the-top, wanna-slit-my-own-throat...
每一天每一分每一秒都爱着她012---in love with her, that for every minute of every hour of every day...
我都在怨恨  为何是你先认识她012---I can't believe my own damn bad luck that you met her first!
很不错012---That's pretty good.
但是别那么夸张012---But you might want to tone it down a little.
是亚曼达载我来的012---So Amanda just dropped me off.
我就喜欢她这一点012---That's one of the things I love about her.
成年人可以开车012---She's old enough to drive.

亚曼达呢012---Well where's Amanda?
瑞秋  能帮我拿咳嗽药水012---Hey Rach, could you get me some cough drops?
我在想你可以带她012---I mean you know, I'm thinking. You could bring her...
去你的旧房间  然后不上床012---and you guys could go up to your old room, and not make out.
罗斯  给我咳嗽药水012---Ross, cough drops, please?
至少她跟我出去012---At least I know she's not going out with me...
不是为了看限制级电影012---to get into R-rated movies.
你干脆娶她算了012---Why don't you just marry her?
我忘了  你不行  她不是同性恋012---Oh no, wait a minute you can't, I'm sorry I forgot, she's not a lesbian.
亚曼达和我  什么都不是012---You see Amanda and I have a very special... You have nothing!
你们根本没在约会  你是她的保姆012---You're not even going out! You're her baby sitter!
你在做小女生做的事012---You have a 12-year-old girl's job!
真可悲啊012---That is so sad.
你笑什么  你男朋友还不是爱喝酒012---And what are you laughing at, Miss My-keg-sucking-boyfriend...
又偷钱012---is-stealing-from-me?
他偷了几块钱012---So he stole a couple bucks from me. Big deal!
他买东西给我012---At least he got me something with it.
那是我的012---That's mine!
你们两个成熟一点好吗012---Now, would you both please start acting like adults?
把咳嗽药水拿给我012---And give me my cough drops!
好  对不起012---Fine. Sorry.
拿去012---Here.
谢谢012---Thank you.

没012---No.
我们接吻了  不是我主动的  但我也没阻止012---We kissed. I didn't initiate the kiss, but I also didn't stop it.
我一直觉得很内疚012---and I've been feeling guilty.
好012---Okay.
所以...012---So...
我们没事吧012---are we cool?
好012---Okay.
我就知道你会谅解012---I knew you'd understand.
