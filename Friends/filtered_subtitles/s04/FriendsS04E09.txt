是啊  什么叫八百年没狂欢  跟我在一起就很快乐啊012---Really. And what do you mean you never have fun anymore? You have fun with me.
记不记得那次看脱衣舞  你给我50美元要我吞书012---Remember the time we saw those strippers and you paid me 50 bucks to eat that book?
乔伊  你会喜爱这个人的  就像是"舞会魔法师"012---Joey, you are gonna love this guy. Gandalf is like the party wizard.
你们干嘛叫他"甘道夫"   魔法师甘道夫啊012---Well, why do you call him Gandalf? Gandalf the wizard.
喂  你高中难道没看过"指环王"吗012---Hello? Didn't you read Lord of the Rings in high school?
没有  但我高中上过床来着012---No, I had sex in high school.

淑女服饰的采购助理有空缺012---There's an opening for an assistant buyer in Junior Miss
那我岂不是连降三级了012---Okay, but that would actually be a big step down for me.
不是啦  事实上  我是说我挺合适的012---No, actually, I meant for me.
招聘委员会每天都在面试012---The hiring committee is meeting people all day and...
我很希望我能拒绝  但我总不能让你当我一辈子的助理吧012---Oh. Well, I wish I could say no, but I guess you can't stay my assistant forever.

真的啊  那样的话012---Really? Well, in that case
我非常高兴你同意了  没什么问题了012---And that's why I'm so glad there's no problem.
那好吧  其实我也是招聘委员会的一员  你去起码能看到一张熟面孔012---That's fine, actually I'm on the hiring committee, so there'll be at least one friendly face.
噢  太好了012---Oh, that's great.
你知道  我也是从淑女部干起的012---You know, Junior Miss is where I started.
噢  那时为了得到那份工作  不得不跟最丑的男人上床012---I had to sleep with the ugliest guy to get that job.

是真的012---Yeah.
我是说  假的啦012---I mean, no. No, no, no. Ha, ha. No. Ha, ha.
别担心  我可以肯定  以你的资历  不用跟男人上床也能得到这份工作012---don't you worry, I'm sure with your qualifications you won't need to sleep with some guy to get that job.
虽然我对此并不十分信服012---Although, uh, I might need some convincing.
哦  我  开玩笑的012---Um... Oh. Kidding. Ha, ha.
天啊  我今天还真有点兴奋012---God, I feel wild today. Aah!

能不能冷静点  他不过是个普通人而已012---Will you calm down? He's just a human guy.
你不明白的  甘道夫超神的012---Look, you don't understand. Gandalf is amazing.
你将无法知道下一步将发生什么012---Y'know you're never know what's gonna end up happening,
你开始只不过是跟他去喝两杯   醒来竟然正在坐渔船去加拿大012---You go out for a couple of beers and end up on a fishing boat to Nova Scotia.

好012---Okay.
喂012---Hello?

他在芝加哥被耽搁了  没办法来012---He's not gonna make it. He's stuck in Chicago.
要命012---Oh, man.
芝加哥  真是太走运了012---Chicago, is sooo lucky!
我还蠢得去换了这些加拿大元币012---Stupid, useless Canadian money.
葛林小姐  你的工作经历还不错012---You have a very impressive resume, Ms. Green.
我认为您这里提到的文件归档系统非常棒012---I especially like what I see here about implementing a new filing system.
谢谢012---Thank you.
文件归档系统  就是你弄在文件夹上那些彩色标签012---Filing system? Oh, you mean those-those little colored labels you put on all the folders?
那倒是的确给档案柜增色不少012---It certainly did brighten up the inside of the filing cabinets.
标签的作用不止于此012---Well, they, uh... they-they did more than that.
我看到你肩负了许多重要职责012---I notice that you've been entrusted with a lot of important responsibilities.
对  乔安娜确实对我有知遇之恩012---Yes. Joanna really has been an incredible mentor to me.
瑞秋每天早上给我送百吉饼  做得也非常不错012---Oh. And Rachel has been really incredible at getting my morning bagel.
不可思议  她几乎每次都不会买错012---It's amazing how she gets it right almost every time.
我  我  我当然  还有其他更多的职责012---I-I-I of course, I have more responsibilities than that.
没错  还有咖啡也是  瑞秋一次能拎两样东西012---Oh, yes, of course. There's the coffee too. Rachel can carry two things at once.
相当优秀012---That's, uh, very good.
现在这个工作的很大一部分012---Now a uh, a big part of this job...
是建立同他人的关系  特别是和设计师012---...is cultivating personal relationships, especially with designers.
对  我意识到… 这点瑞秋没问题012---Yes, Yes, I realize that... Rachel shouldn't have any problem with that.
唯一的问题就是怕她打得太火热  如果你们知道我说的012---Her only problem might be getting a little too friendly, if you know what I mean.
我最喜欢和设计师共事了012---I love working with designers.
共事或共枕  又有什么差别呢  瑞秋012---With them, under them, what's the difference, eh, Rach?
我第一篇美食评论上报了  哦  《切尔西报道》012---Hey. My first review is out. Oh! Oh, the Chelsea Reporter, ohh,
以前我都拿它来盖在身上御寒012---Ah. These used to keep me so warm.

好   "我还会再去光顾亚历山卓吗  当然  但我会点两份餐012---Okay. "Would I go back to Allesandro's? Sure, but I would have to order two meals.
一份给我   一份给那个用枪指着我的头逼我再到这个餐厅的人"012---One for me, and one for the guy pointing the gun to my head."
哇  你真把这家店批得一文不值012---Wow, you really laid into this place.
报社付我钱  又不是要我广结朋友012---Hey, they don't pay me a penny a word to make friends.
我得走了  我找到一个人  他可以修咱们外面的货车012---Ooh, I gotta go. I found a guy who could fix up the van for catering.
要不要我跟你一块去  不用  没事012---Oh. Do you need me to go with you? No, no, it's okay.
但你确定我们不要那张水床了么012---But are we sure we don't want the waterbed?
我们不是早就说好了  对啦012---Haven't we made this decision? Yeah.
再见  再见012---Bye. Bye.
谁啊012---Who is it?
我是亚历山卓餐厅的老板012---It's Allesandro, from Allesandro's.
天啊012---Oh, my God.
我想跟你谈谈你的那篇评论  哦  天啊  天啊012---I wanna talk to you about your review. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
你打电话给我012---Call me on the phone.
为什么  那样你可以随时挂掉电话012---Why? So you could hang up on me?
我不会让你上来的  你还是走吧012---But I'm never gonna let you up, so you may as well just go away.
给我个机会012---Just give me a chance to...
你要进去么  来吧012---Hey, Do you need to get in? Here you go.
菲比  不行啦  嗨  摩妮卡012---No, Phoebe! Oh, hey, Monica.
我要你收回你的评论  我们的食物绝非"难以下咽"012---I want a retraction. Our food is not "inedible swill."
我就吃不下去012---I couldn't eat it.
我那五个朋友也难以下咽  虽然他们中的一个连书都能吃012---I have five friends who couldn't eat it, and one of them eats books.
那么  至少我们的服务  也不是"宾至如衰"012---Well, our service is not "grossly incompetent."
你们的服务员把面包棒塞在裤子里012---The waiter carried the breadsticks in his pants.
你还写  我们店里接受发现卡012---Well, you said that we accept the Discover Card
其实不行012---which we do not.
好啊  那句话我可以收回012---All right, that I'll retract.
但我坚持我的观点  我懂美食  但决不是你们那样012---But I stand by my review. I know food, and that wasn't it.
你们的意式沙拉  尝起来就像是番茄汁012---Your marinara sauce tastes like tomato juice.
你们应该加些伏特加酒与芹菜末012---You should serve it with vodka and a piece of celery.
我以店里那果汁为荣  很美味012---Hey, I'm proud of that sauce. It's delicious.
天啊012---Oh, my God.
你是开意大利餐厅的  竟然认为那样很美味012---You own an Italian restaurant and you think that tastes good?
你从哪来的012---Where are you even from?
黎巴嫩012---Lebanon.
把那些蕃茄递给我012---Hand me those tomatoes.
我来示范纯正的味道是怎样来的  给我012---I'm gonna show you what it should taste like. Come on.
你要弄多久啊  我还要去骂另一个美食评论家012---How long is this gonna take? 'Cause I got another critic I gotta go yell at.
乔安娜  我想跟你谈谈面试的事012---Ahem. Uh, Joanna, I wanna talk about that interview.
我觉得你的面试不错啊012---I thought it went very well.
不  它很差  我就是要跟你说这件事012---No, it didn't. That's what I wanna talk to you about.
现在  简单点说012---Now, just to brief you
我可能会哭出来012---I may cry.
并不是因为伤心和生气012---But they are not tears of sadness or of anger
而是因为我要你跟讨论这件事012---but just of me having this discussion with you.
瑞秋  请不要这样012---Rachel, please, don't make a scene.
这里又没人012---There's nobody here.
苏菲  你进来012---Sophie, get in here.
看吧  你让苏菲尴尬了012---You see? Now you're making Sophie uncomfortable.
我没有尴尬啊012---She's not making me uncomfortable.
恭喜  你总算有点作用了  出去012---Congratulations, You now just crossed the line into completely useless. Get out.
你是要我辞职吗012---Do you want me to quit?
什么  你怎么会这样想012---What? What would make you think that?
因为那些你在面试时说的话012---Well, all of those things you said in the interview.
如果里面有你的真心话  那我一定不是个好助理012---I mean If you believe any of them, I must not be a very good assistant.
不如这样吧012---You know what?
我收拾下办公桌012---I am just going to pack up my desk
今天下班后就走人012---and I will be gone by the end of the day.
我想没必要耗到今天下班了012---Well, I guess there's no use me sticking around till the end of the day.
你等等…012---Wait, wait, wait.
把那可怜的小松糕放回抽屉里012---You can put your sad little muffin back in its drawer.
如果你要听实话的话  我不想失去你这完美的助理012---If you must know the truth, I didn't wanna lose a perfectly good assistant.
什么012---What?
所以我才瞎掰出你轻浮和酗酒的事012---That's why I said all those things about your flirting and your drinking.
我酗酒012---My drinking?
那我一定是在你离开后说的012---Oh. I must have said that after you left.
你到底说了什么012---Said what, exactly?
你时不时喜欢酗酒...012---That you enjoyed the occasional drink...
酒后乱性012---...ing binge.
天啊  够了  我得离开这012---Oh, my God. Oh. That is it. I'm leaving.
你太可怕了  不要  等等012---You are just a horrible person. No, wait, wait, wait.
如果你真的在意这个职位的话012---Now, if you're gonna get all sensitive about it.
我真不想失去你012---I don't want to lose you.
不如  我给你创造这么个职位怎样012---What if I create a position for you?
我让你在这部门里  担任采购助理012---I'll make you assistant buyer in this department.
再多说一点012---Say more things like that. Um...
你有自己独立的办公室  外带加薪  明天就生效012---You can have your own office and a raise, effective tomorrow.
我需要公费报销  没问题012---I'd need an expense account. Done.
还要有助理  苏菲  进来012---And an assistant. Sophie, get in here.
嘿  你们怎么在这里012---Hey, what are you guys doing here?
我以为你们和甘到夫狂欢了012---I thought you'd be partying with Gandoldorf.
是甘道夫  他不来了012---It's Gandalf, and he's not coming.
那你们一早都呆坐在这里  没有012---So you've been sitting here all morning? No.
我刚刚把帐算好了012---I balanced my checkbook.
对  我给所有的足球桌里的小人都起了名字012---Yeah, and I gave first names to all the foosball players.
不敢相信甘道夫竟然没来012---I can't believe he didn't come.
他不来又怎样  我们还是可以自己出去狂欢啊012---So what if he didn't come? We can still go out and party ourselves.
哦  不  有甘道夫在  我们一整晚都有的玩的012---Oh, no, you know, with Gandalf, we'd be out all night.
而且还能和一堆陌生人一起混  跟他们待在外面不回来012---Yeah, we'd meet total strangers and hang out with them.
我们也可以啊012---Well, we can do that.
他还有其他的绝招012---There was other stuff too.
我们都会啊  而且更好012---We'll do it all, and better.
瞧着吧  今晚过后  就换我们带甘道夫去狂欢  兄弟们012---Look, after tonight, Gandalf will wanna party with us, dude.
来吧012---Come on.
对  对012---Yeah. Yeah.
好像我们不会狂欢似的  好了么  我们走012---It's not like we don't know how to party. Yeah. All right. Let's go.
最后再到一次船上如何012---And may-maybe we could end up on a boat again?
好耶012---Yeah! All right!
哈012---Ah!

摩妮卡  问你个小问题  采购助理穿这套装如何012---Hey Mon, little question for ya! How do you think this suit will look on an assistant buyer?
亚历山卓的老板上门来吼我012---Okay, the owner of Allesandro's came over to yell at me,
但我趁机做了些沙拉给他  结果他就雇我当他的首席大厨012---but instead I made him some sauce, and he offered me the job as head chef!!
天啊012---Oh, my God.
你毁了我在回家路上练了好久的好戏  但我真是替你高兴012---You just ruined the thing I was practicing the whole way home, but I'm so happy.
