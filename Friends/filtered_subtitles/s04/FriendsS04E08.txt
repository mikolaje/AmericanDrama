但我还是想在电话里给你道歉  我…012---I just thought I'd try and apologize over the phone...All I...
喂012---Hello?
听着  我不该亲你的女朋友  但我…012---Look, I never should've kissed your girlfriend, but I'm...

看  各位  这就是感恩节的精神012---Look, everyone, it's the spirit of Thanksgiving.
你和乔伊好点了吗012---So are things with you and Joey any better?
糟糕透了  昨晚我给他拨了8个小时的电话012---They couldn't be worse. I spent eight hours calling him last night,
想让他和我说说话012---just trying to get him to talk to me.
哇  8小时012---Oh, wow. Eight hours.
你一定用的着那种配在电话上的小耳机012---So you could probably really use one of those plug-in telephone headsets, huh?
我们都会收到  你从办公室偷来的圣诞礼物吗012---Should we all expect Christmas gifts that can be stolen from your office?
没你的份012---You shouldn't.
说到圣诞节012---Speaking of Christmas...
摩妮卡和我刚开业  没什么钱012---since Monica and I are starting a new business and have like no money...
今年可以来个秘密的圣诞  我们每人就买一个礼物012---this year maybe we could do Secret Santa and then we each only buy one gift.
这样还多了个神秘感  看谁送给谁012---And-and there's the added mystery of, you know, who gets who.
是谁抽到〝哪个人〞012---Who gets "whom."
我不知道为什么这么做012---I don't know why I do that.
我得睡一会  火鸡让我犯困了012---Oh, I'm gonna take a nap. Turkey makes me sleepy.
我们还没吃那012---We haven't eaten yet.
我知道  但你们一直在准备  那我就…012---I know, but all that work you're doing to get it ready, and I just...
你们谁打算抽到瑞秋吗  因为我想送她个礼物012---Hey, by any chance did either of pick uh Rachel for your secret Santa, Because I wanna trade for her.
我抽到她  谢天谢地幸好你要她012---I picked her. Oh, thank God, you want her.Ooh!
为什么你这么不想送她礼物012---Wow, why do you wanna get rid of her so badly?
因为她收到什么礼物都拿去换012---Because she exchanges every gift she ever gets,
根本没法送给她她想要的东西012---It's like impossible to get her something she likes.
来吧  咱俩换换012---Come on, let's trade.
不会的  哪有这回事  她很喜欢我送她的那个背包的012---That's not true. That's not true. I got her that backpack and she loved it.
记得有只大狗叼走的时候  她哭的多伤心…012---I remember how much she was crying the day that big dog ran off with it…
根本没有什么大狗012---There was no big dog.
不管这个了  我已经给她买了个皮包  还在上面印上了R.G…012---All right this sucks, because I already got her this briefcase and I had "R.G." put on it.
是她的姓名缩写012---Her initials. Oh.
也许你可以送给别人  像罗斯盖勒  一样的缩写012---Maybe you can give it to somebody else. Oh. Like Ross Geller.
但那是个女用公事包012---Oh, you know what, though? It's a girlie briefcase.
那又怎样  他在博物馆上班012---Who cares? He works in a museum.
嘿  几点了  球赛要开始了012---Hey, what time is it? The big game's about to start.
罗斯和乔伊又不在  没必要这样  愿意的话就看游行呗012---You don't have to do that, Ross and Joey aren't here. watch the parade if you want.
谢了012---Thanks.
这个冷冻室出什么毛病了  嗷  嗷012---What is wrong with this freezer? Ow! Ow!
怎么了  天啊  冰渣进我眼睛了012---God, what happened? Oh, my God, ice just got in my eye.
有人还想在这儿睡觉012---People are trying to sleep in here.
摩妮卡的眼睛进冰渣了  很疼012---Monica got ice in her eye and it hurts.
睁开  让我看看  不行  太疼了012---Open it up. Let me see. Oh, I can't. It really kills.
或许应该冰敷012---Well, maybe you should put some ice on it.
好像很严重  也许该送你去看医生012---Ooh, it looks bad. Honey, Maybe we should take you to a doctor.
不行  我的眼科医生是理查012---No, my eye doctor is Richard.
没有男朋友我不能去见他的012---I can't go to him when I don't have a boyfriend.
他对病人的确够挑剔的012---He's really picky about his patients.
你非去不可  他诊所电话号码是多少012---Okay, you've gotta go. What's his office number?
我哪会记得012---Oh, like I remember his office number.
试试快捷键7012---Speed dial 7.
嗨  我是代表摩妮卡盖勒的眼睛在说话012---Hi, yeah, I'm calling on behalf of Monica Geller's eye, and...
理查柏克今天在上班吗012---Is Richard Burke in today?
他出城了   她愿意见其他随叫随到的医生么012---He's out of town. but does she wanna see the on-call doctor?
愿意  愿意  她非常兴奋012---Yes. Yes. She's very excited about that.
太酷了012---This is so cool.
摩妮卡回来之前  我是主厨  所有决定都由我来做012---Till Monica gets back, it's like I'm head chef and I get to make all the decisions.
嘿  嘿  我想她跟你说了  让你按照食谱来012---Hey, hey, I thought she told you to follow the recipe exactly.
滚出我的厨房012---Okay, get out of my kitchen.
好  我想我跟乔伊之间有进展了012---All right, okay. I think I'm making some progress with Joey.
我进房的时候  他直接回他的卧室012---When I went into the apartment, he went straight into his bedroom...
他只摔了一下门012---...but he only slammed the door once!
不过摔门的时候  对我比了中指012---I mean, yeah, he gave me the finger while doing it.
好吧  我得打电话问问我妈左撇子做菜的问题012---All right I… I gotta call my mom and ask her a left-handed cooking question.
听着  我抽到送摩妮卡礼物012---So listen, I picked Monica for Secret Santa...
但我光明节送过她了012---...but I'm getting her something for Hanukkah.
你想和我换换012---I was wondering if you wanna switch.
知道么  我是想要送给你012---Oh y'know what, I was already trying to trade for ah, well, you.
真的  有意思  打算送我什么012---Really?! Wow! That's so nice, what are you gonna get me?
不晓得  R.G  办公室里用的女式用品012---I don't know, R.G. I was thinking something girlie for your office.
也许菲比愿意跟我换012---Yeah. Well, maybe Phoebe will switch with me.
最好不要  那你会抽到瑞秋  她什么礼物都会拿去换012---Oh no-no-no, you don't want to do that,Then you're gonna get stuck with Rachel, and she exchanges every gift she ever gets.
不可能  我送她很多东西她都留着的012---Oh, that's not true. I got her lots of stuff she never took back.
比如012---Like?
比如像我去年送的金项链012---Like that gold necklace I got her last year.
你最后一次看到她带着是什么时候012---When was the last time you saw her wear it?
她整个圣诞都带着  然后…012---Well, she wore it all Christmas day and then, uh...
大狗012---Big dog?
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
你在干什么012---What are you doing?
把钱德内疚买的东西全部退回去012---Sending back all this stuff that Chandler bought out of guilt.
全部  包括电视  不  电视要搬进我房里012---Everything? Even the TV? No, I'm put that in my room.
听着  乔伊  我知道他做错了012---Listen, Joey. I know what he did was wrong.
但你就不能听他解释吗012---But don't you think you could at least hear the guy out?
你和瑞秋在一起时012---Back when you and Rachel were together...
要是钱德吻了她  你会听他解释吗012---...if Chandler had kissed her, would you hear him out?
说得好012---That's a good point.
那你要惩罚他多久012---So uh, how long are you gonna punish him?
五年012---Five years.
你在判他刑012---You've sentenced him?
嘿  若要人不知  除非己莫为012---Hey, don't do the crime if you can't do the time.
但是乔伊  他可是你最好的朋友  不  那是以前012---But, Joey, the guy's your best friend. No, was my best friend.
你干嘛拼命替他说情012---Anyway, I don't know why you're pushing for him so hard.
少了他  我"最要好的朋友"就空出来了012---With him out of the way as my best friend, there's a spot open.
谁  我吗  对012---Who, me? Yeah.
当然  真荣幸012---Wow. I'm honored.
那么作为你最好的朋友  我该做的第一件事就是012---And you know what I'm gonna do as my first act as your best friend?
我得让你去跟钱德说话012---I'm gonna get you to talk to Chandler.
好啦012---All right.
除非你是我最好的朋友…012---Oh, but if you weren't my best friend...
天哪  真的那么严重012---Oh, my God. Is it really that bad?
我进了门  他根本不理我012---I walk in the room, and he won't even talk to me.
他只是用意大利语在那儿嘟囔012---He just mumbles something in Italian.
我知道他只会那些骂人的词儿012---And I know he only knows the bad words.
阿甘  有没有看到钱德012---Hey, Gunther, have you uh, have you seen Chandler?
我以为你才是钱德012---I thought you were Chandler.
你们其中一个在那边012---But, um, one of you is over there.
嘿  乔伊012---Hey, Joe.
请稍等一下  好吗012---I'll be right with you, okay?
谢谢你012---Thanks
天哪  这个代诊医生真帅012---Oh, my God. How cute is the on-call doctor?
够帅啊  帅到我想拿笔插我的眼睛012---Oh. So cute that I'm thinking about jamming this pen in my eye.
柏克医生在等你012---Dr. Burke will see you now.
不  不   柏克医生不在  出城去了012---Oh, no, no, no, not Dr. Burke. Dr. Burke's out of town.
现在我要看的是另一个医生012---The on-call doctor will see me now.
理查柏克医生不在012---Dr. Richard Burke is out of town.
他儿子提摩西柏克医生帮你看012---Dr. Timothy Burke, his son, will see you now.
准备好了吗012---Ready?
对不起  刚才…012---Hey, I'm sorry. That...
你要去哪里  我爸妈家012---Where you going? My folks'.
什么时候回来012---Oh, uh, when-when are you coming back?
不知道012---I don't know.
待一段时间  顺便再去找个新房子住012---I might stay there for a few days while I look for an apartment.
什么012---What?
原先我以为我们可以谈开来  然后和好012---Yeah, you know, at first I thought we could talk about this, work it out.
但一看到你俩在一起  我就……012---but uh, seeing you two together I don't think I…
那你想让我说什么  说我不去见她了吗012---Hey, look, what do you want me to say? Do you want me to say I'll stop seeing her?
跟她无关  好吗012---Look, It's not about her. Okay?
一看到你俩  就让我想起你的所作所为012---But seeing you two together just reminds me of what you did.
我不跟一个不懂朋友道义的人  住在一起012---And I don't wanna live with someone who doesn't know what it is to be a friend.
我告辞了  我懂朋友道义012---So I'll see you. Hey, look, I know what it is to be a friend.
我只是  只是搞砸了  对  没错012---I just-I just screwed up! Yeah, you did.
所以我要搬走012---And that's why I'm leaving.
听着  你不为我留下来  至少要为它们留下来012---All right look, if you're not gonna stay for me, then at least stay for them.
它们这一年很不顺  还有那次抢劫012---Okay? They have had a very difficult year, what with the robbery and all.
那个家伙在抢我们东西的时候012---When that guy was robbing us...
我在柜子里被关了六小时012---...and I was locked in the entertainment unit for six hours...
你知道我当时在干嘛吗012---do you know what I was doing in there all that time?
我是在想  我多么的对不起你012---I was thinking about how I let you down.
对012---Wow. Yeah.
早知道你会见色忘友  我根本不会那样做012---Yeah! But if would've know what kind of friend you were gonna turn out to be, I wouldn't have worried about it so much!
再见012---See you around.
等一下   再给我个机会012---Just wait one second. There has to be something that I can do.Something!
要是还有那个柜子012---If we still had that entertainment unit...
我宁愿在里面待上6个小时  检讨我是怎样的对不起你012---...I would get in there for six hours and think about how I let you down.
怎么了012---What?
这儿有个箱子012---We got a box.
我记得上次见到你012---I remember the last time I saw you.
是我离家去学校的那天早上012---It was the morning I left for college.
你站在乳品皇后店外面012---And You were just standing outside the Dairy Queen.
可能是在等它开门012---Heh. Just probably waiting for it to open.
我得说  你现在好漂亮012---I gotta tell you, you look great now.
你也很帅  你真是个与众不同的病人012---You look great too. You're an excellent patient.
伤痕明显么012---So how does it look?
角膜上还有点伤  你得带个眼罩保护两三天012---You've got a little scratch on your cornea. You're gonna have to wear a patch for a couple of days.
像海盗那样012---Like a pirate?
大致是那样012---If that helps you.
你跟你爸一起工作多久了012---Ahem. So how long have you been working with your dad?
别这样  咱俩总有一个要提起他012---Come on, one of us had to mention him.
两个月前搬回来的012---I moved back here a couple months ago.
晚上有个家庭聚餐吧012---Oh. Big family dinner tonight?
不是吧012---No way.
我本来打算在女朋友家过感恩节的012---I was gonna have Thanksgiving at my girlfriend's.
但我们分手了012---Oh. But we broke up.
她对恋爱本身态度并不严肃012---She-she wasn't ready for a serious commitment.
所以你把她从甲板上弄下去了  是吧  水手012---Oh. So you made her walk the plank, aye, matey?
你还没带上眼罩呢012---You're not wearing the patch yet.
我知道012---I know.
他要来我们这儿过感恩节  对啊  好变态啊012---He's coming here for Thanksgiving? I know. It's sick.
为什么变态  因为他是理查的儿子012---Why is it sick? Because it's Richard's son.
简直是把希腊悲剧故事邀请来了012---It's like inviting a Greek tragedy over for dinner.
菲比  你理解我  对吧012---Hey, come on, Phoebe, you understand, don't you?
可以说是  但做为你好友就得说  不012---Yeah, I can see where I'd be your best shot but, no.
对不起  但我认为你把事情弄乱了012---I'm sorry, but I think it's twisted.
什么事儿乱了  我跟理查的儿子约会012---What's twisted? Oh. Me going out with Richard's son.
好嗯012---Ewwwww!!
嗯 嗯 嗯012---Ew, ew, ew.
听起来是不怎么样012---Sounds like a really bad idea to me.
他在里面没事儿吧012---Is he okay in there?
他很好012---He's fine.
要是你跟理查的儿子真的成了012---Hey, y'know, Mon, if things wrong out between you and Richard's son, ...
你就能对你们的孩子说  你和他们的祖父上过床012---...you'll be able to tell your kids that you slept with their grandfather.
好  随你们怎么批评  不过012---Fine! Judge all you want to but,
和女同性恋结婚  临阵逃婚  迷上滑冰舞的同性恋012---married a lesbian, left a man at the altar, fell in love with a gay ice dancer...
把女生的木腿丢进火里  住在箱子里012---...threw a girl's wooden leg in the fire, live in a box.
那么  这个箱子是什么用意012---So, now, ahem, what exactly is the point of the box?
钱德012---Chandler?
箱子的用意有三点012---The meaning of the box is three fold.
一是  让我有时间好好反思我的所作所为012---One, it gives me the time to think about what I did.
二是  说明我是多么在乎跟乔伊的友谊012---Two, it proves how much I care about my friendship with Joey.
三是012---And three
会痛012---it hurts.
嘿  喔012---Oh, hey, hey, uh... Hmm?
还记得我去年送你的项链吗012---you remember the necklace I gave you last year?
能给我看看么012---Can I see it?
为什么012---Why?
只是想看看而已012---I just wanna check something.
好012---Okay.
等着瞧吧012---Now we'll see.
没气了  没气了012---Air hole! Air hole!
在这里  我很喜欢  整天带着012---Here it is. I love it. I wear it all the time.
我送你的是金项链  这个是银的012---The necklace I got you was gold. this is silver.
也许它012---Huh. Well, maybe, it, uh
变色了012---it changed.
天哪  你真的把它给换了012---Oh, my God. You actually exchanged it.
换一个我喜欢又常用的东西012---Well isn't it better that I exchanged it for something that I enjoy
这样不好吗012---and that I can get a lot of use out of?
你换了什么012---What did you get?
存款012---Credit.
我来开  我来开  我来开012---I'll get it, I'll get it, I'll get it.
嗨  提姆  嗨012---Hi, Tim. Hi.
嗨  谢谢  来见见我的朋友012---Hi. Thank you. Come meet my friends.
这是菲比  幸会012---This is Phoebe. Hi, nice to meet you.
乔伊  你好012---And Joey. Hey.
乔伊  我哥哥罗斯012---Joey. My brother, Ross.
你好  还有瑞秋012---Hey. And Rachel.
你好012---Hi. Ahem.
那是钱德  你好012---That's Chandler. How do you do?
这是  他在012---What's...? Um, well, he's, um...
他在反省012---He's doing some thinking.
他得分了012---He's got it.
耶  耶012---Yes! Yeah!
怎么了  怎么了  你亲了我的女友012---What happened? What happened?! You kissed my girlfriend.
喔  我喜欢那些太阳镜012---Ooh, I like those sunglasses.
"真的喜欢"  还是喜欢它们012---"Like them" like them...
还是喜欢它们带来的存款012---...or "I'd like to get store credit for that amount" like them?
好了各位  火鸡上桌了012---All right, everybody. This turkey is ready.
在哪洗手  这里012---Where can I wash up? Here.
我带你去012---Let me show you.
毛巾在水池旁边  你能用那块高级香皂012---Okay, the towels are hanging next to the sink, and umm, you can use the fancy soap.
谢谢012---Thank you.
高级香皂  我还以为是为教皇准备的012---Fancy soap? I thought we were saving that for the Pope.
他不错  是吧012---See? He's nice, right?
是的  不过莫妮卡  你是否想过发展下去  就能这么说了012---Yeah, but Monica, do you actually want to be in a relationship where you can actually use the phrase,
"你父亲以前可不这么做"012---"That's not how your dad used to do it"?
哇  真丰盛  我坐哪儿012---Wow, everything looks great. Where should I sit?
我帮你留了个位子012---Saved you a seat.
变态-变态-变态-变态012---Sick-sick-sick-sick.
我来开门012---Oh, I'll get it.
被我骗了012---Gotcha.
这听起来不像是在为我反思012---That doesn't sound like thinking to me.
对不起  我可不认为你应该说话012---Sorry. Y'know I don't think you should be talking at all in there!
要反思那么多事情  应该没空说话和开玩笑的012---I think you got too much thinking to do to be talking and making jokes.
好  好  遵命012---Okay, okay, you got it.
罗斯  递给我红薯  好么012---Ross, could you pass me the yams? Sure.
你想换的话  乔伊那里还有土豆泥012---Oh, and Joey's got the mashed potatoes if you want to exchange them.
够了  你到底怎么了012---Will you stop? What is the matter with you?
有客人喔012---Oh-ho-ho, We've got company.
我没什么事儿012---There's nothing the matter with me.
可我不缺乏情感012---See, I'm not completely devoid of sentiment.
我有感受的012---See, I have feelings.
好  很好012---Okay, fine.
你们都哑巴了吧  我来缓解一下气氛012---You can't tell, but I'm trying to break the tension by mooning you guys.
好  听着012---All right, look.
如果你把它当成笑话  那就算了  好吗012---If this is just a big joke to you, then forget about it, all right?
这对我不是玩笑012---This means something to me.
你要是觉得无所谓  那你马上走012---And if it doesn't mean anything to you, then you should get out of there.
除非你是个愿意呆在箱子里的傻瓜012---Otherwise, you're just an idiot in a box.
你说的对  我错了  这事对我很重要012---You're right. I'm sorry. This means a lot to me.
我要让你重新成为我的朋友  我发誓  今晚不再说一个字了012---I want you to be my friend again. I swear I won't say another word tonight.
你真的会当回事  绝对会012---So you're gonna take this thing seriously? Absolutely.
又说话了012---That sounds like another word to me.
你真的会当一回事吗012---Are you gonna take this seriously?
很好012---Okay.
不要说我没有情感啊012---Don't say that I have no sentiment.
这是第一次  我们约会的电影票根012---This is a movie stub from our first date.
这是第一次  你为我做床上早点的蛋壳012---This is an eggshell from the first time you made me breakfast in bed.
这是从博物馆的拿  我们第一次…012---This is from the museum, the first time we...
在一起的时候012---...were together.
对  也许我是常把礼物换掉  但有意义的东西我会留012---Okay, maybe I exchange gifts sometimes, but I keep the things that matter.
我不知道该说什么好  对不起012---I don't know what to say. I'm sorry.
不过012---Though
你不该把这个拿走012---you're not supposed to take these.
它有差不多百万年的历史012---It's like a million years old.
事实上  我们还派专人去找过的012---we, we actually, we had people looking for that.
老是会卡住012---Oh, this always happens.
