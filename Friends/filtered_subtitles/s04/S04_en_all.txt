Okay, so we went to the beach
because Phoebe found out about this lady who knew her mom and dad
and I don't really know what happened with that.
I'm your mother.
Oh, and then Monica joked that she wouldn't go out with a guy like Chandler
and he couldn't let it go, and... I don't really know what happened with that either.
And then Ross's new girlfriend, Bonnie, shows up
and Rachel convinced her to save her head. And then Ross and Rachel kiss
and now Ross has to choose between Rachel and the bald girl.
and I don't know what happened there either...
You know what, hold on, let me go get Chandler.
Hi.
Hi. Hey.
Rachel was just helping me out. My head got all sunburned.
Thanks a million. Oh, you're welcome a million.
Okay, I'll see you in our room.
Oh my God.
I know.
Okay, I gotta go.
What?. Why?.
I got to go break up with Bonnie.
Here? Now?
Yeah. I can't stay here all night.
and if I go in there she's-she's gonna wanna...
do stuff.
Well, can't you tell her that you are not in the mood?
No, she likes that.
Yeah. Faking sleep doesn't work either.
I can't tell you how many mornings I woke up with her...
Yeah, why am I telling you that?  I don't know.
It wasn't every morning... Making it worse.
Friends S04E01  The one with the jellyfish
So I guess you'd like to know how it all happened.
I think I can figure it out.
I guess You know I was born, and everyone started lying their asses off.
No. It wasn't like that I...
Remember how I told you how Lily, Frank, and I we were, we were close.
We were very close.
How close?
The three of us we were, kind of, a couple.
I don't even know how that would work.
Well, we were... I'm not asking.
Well, any how, some how I got pregnant...
and I was...
scared. I was stupid and selfish...
I was 18 years old. I mean, you remember what it's like to be eighteen years old?
Yeah. Let's see, my had Mom killed herself, and my Dad had run off,
and I was living in a Gremlin with a guy named Cindy who talked to his hand.
Well, I'm so sorry. I thought I was leaving you with the best parents in the world.
I didn't even hear about your Mom and Dad til a couple of years ago.
and by then you were already grown up.
I don't know, you're here, and I would, I would really, I would like to get to know you.
Yeah, well, everybody does.
I'm a really cool person.
And You know you had 29 years to find that out, but you didn't even try.
You know what, you walked out on me, and I'm just, I'm gonna do the same thing to you.
Wait. I don't ever want to see you again.
Where's my purse?
Shoot. We're out of soda.
I'll go out and get you some. Really?
Nope. Because I'm not your boyfriend.
Hey, Pheebs, how'd it go?
My Mom's friend, Phoebe, is actually my birth Mom.
I found a dried up seashores.
Sweety, what are you talking about?
My new mom, who's a big fat abandoner.
Wait, Pheebs, wait a second. Don't you wanna stay here and talk about it?
No. I'm just, I wanna, I need to be alone.
Monica.
It's over.
Was it awful?
It was long.
I didn't realize how late it was...
until I noticed the 5 o'clock shadow on her head.
Anyway, she didn't want to stay. I called a cab; she just left.
I wrote you a letter.
Oh, thank you.
I like mail.
It's just some things I've been thinking about. Some things about us.
and before we can even think about the two of us getting back together...
I just need to know how you feel about this stuff.
Okay.
It's 5:30 in the morning.
So I'd better get cracking on this baby.
Well, I'll be waiting for you, just come up when you're done.
Okay, I'll be up in...
18 pages.
Front and back.
Very exciting.
What happened to you? Why didn't you come up?
Done.
You just finished? Well, I wanted to be thorough.
I mean this-this is clearly very, very important to you, to us.
And so I wanted to read every word carefully,
Twice.
So...Does it?
I'm sorry?
Does it?
Does it? Does it?
Yeah, I wanted to give that whole 'Does it?' part just another glance.
What are you talking about, Ross, you just said that you read it twice.
Look, You know what, either it does or it doesn't, and if you have to even think about it...
No, Rach, No, I don't have to think about it.
In fact...
l've decided. I've decided that...
that it...
does.
Are you sure? Sure, I'm sure.
There's a nuclear holocaust. I'm the last man on earth.
Would you go out with me?
I've got canned goods.
Hey, you guys. Take a look at this.
Check this baby out, dug me a hole.
Excellent hole, Joe.
Oh, no. My hole.
My foot.
What?.. What is it?.
Jellyfish sting. Oh, it hurts. It hurts.. It hurts..
Well, can we help?. You want us to take you back to the house?.
It's like two miles.
Yeah, and I'm a little tired from digging the hole.
Damn the jellyfish.
Damn all the jellyfish.
We've got to do something.
Well, there's really only one thing you can do.
What?. What is it?.
You're gonna have to pee on it.
What?.. Gross..
Don't blame me, I saw it on The Discovery Channel.
You know what, he's right. There's something like ammonia in that...
that like kills the pain.
Well forget it. It doesn't hurt that.
If you want some privacy you can use my hole.
Well, I'm ready to get the hell out of here.
Are you...?
That's so great.
Not for Bonnie.
But for you.
How was the beach? Nothing. I don't know.
What happened? Nothing.
I'm gonna take a shower. Me too.
Me too.
Okay, I'm gonna put this in the car.
I have to go pack.
And it really does? It does.
It really and truly does.
It so does not.
She wants me to take responsibility for everything that went wrong in our relationship.
I mean she goes on for five pages about, about how I was unfaithful to her.
We were on a break.
Oh my God. If you say that one more time, I'm gonna break up with you.
Fine. But this break-up was not all my fault, and she, she says here...
"If you accept full responsibility...
I can begin to trust you again.
Does that seem like something you can do. Does it?
No.
Look, Ross, you have what you want, you're back with Rachel.
If you bring this up now you're gonna wreck the best thing that even happened to you.
Yeah, I know. You're right.
Yeah I guess I'll let it go.
But you-you understand how-how hard it is to forget about this.
Sure, it's hard to forget.
But that doesn't mean you have to talk about it.
A lot of things happened on that trip...
that we should never, ever talk about.
What the hell happened on that beach?.
It's between us and the sea, Ross.
Hi, Ursula.
Okay, well I know that we haven't talked in a long time
but okay, our Mom is not our birth Mom. This-this other lady is our birth Mom.
Right, okay, the one that lives in Montuak.
You know her?
No. I read about her in Mom's suicide note.
There was a suicide note? Do you still have it?
Hang on.
I can't believe you didn't tell me there was a suicide note.
Yeah, so how have you been doing?
I...Shut up
"Goodbye, Phoebe and Ursula. I'll miss you.
P.S. Your mom lives in Montauk."
You just wrote this.
It's pretty much the gist.
Well, except for the poem. You read the poem, right?
No
All right. Hang on.
Pass the cheese, please.
My God, you can't even look at me, Can you?
Nope
Hey， Phoebe， We can talk to Phoebe.
No. I'm-I'm to depressed to talk.
I'll give you a thousand dollars to talk to us.
You guys. what do you think about making that beach trip an annual thing?
No
All right, that's it, you guys， What happened out there?
What? We took a walk. Nothing happened.
I can back with nothing all over me.
Come on. What happened? Joey?
All right. No.
Joey, we swore we'd never tell.
They'll never understand.
Well, we have to say something, We have to get it out. It's eating me alive.
Monica got stung by a jellyfish. All right.
I got stung.
Stung bad.
I couldn't stand.
I couldn't walk.
We were two miles from the house.
We were scared and alone.
We didn't think we could make it.
I was in too much pain.
And I was tired from digging the huge hole.
And then Joey remembered something.
I'd seen this thing on The Discovery Channel...
Wait, I saw that.
On The Discovery Channel, yeah. About jellyfish and how if you...
You peed on yourself?
You can't say that. You don't know.
I mean I thought I was gonna pass out from the pain.
Anyway I tried, but I couldn't...
bend that way.
So...
That's right. I stepped up.
She's my friend and she needed help.
If I had to, I'd pee on any of you.
Only...
I couldn't.
I got the stage fright.
I wanted to help, but there was too much pressure.
So I turned to Chandler.
Joey kept screaming at me, "Do it now. Do it. Do it now."
Sometimes, late at night, I can still hear the screaming.
That's 'cause sometimes I just do it through my wall to freak you out.
Thank you, thank you.
And I invite you to count the colours in your bedroom.
Except for you. You go away.
I'll go in a second.
I just wanted to tell you that...
there hasn't been a day where I didn't regret giving you up.
Okay, bye.
No, I'm not done.
I just want you to know that I, the reason I didn't look you up was because...
well I was afraid that you'd react...
just well like, the way, the way you're reacting right now.
and can't we just, You know, start from here?
No.
Sorry.
But, it's not like we're losing anything.
You know? You came looking for family.
I'm family.
I'm it.
Now I'm done.
But, it's not like we're losing anything. You know?
Yeah, I guess you're right.
It's not like we know each other or have anything in common.
Well, I don't know. I mean it's not like...
we don't have anything in common.
I mean, I like pizza.
I like pizza.
You do?. Wait, I like umm, the Beetles.
Oh, my God. So do I.
Wait-wait-wait, wait. Puppies. Cute or ugly?
So cute.
You see?
But I'm still mad at you.
I know.
I'm mad at me too.
Well, do you wanna get something to eat? I'm kinda hungry.
Hey. Me too.
All right, stop it. Now you're just doing it to freak me out.
I missed you.
I missed you too.
I was so nervous about that letter.
But the way you owned up to everything...
it just showed me how much you've grown. You know?
I suppose.
You have, Ross. You should give yourself credit.
I mean my Mom never thought this would work out.
She said, "Once a cheater, always a cheater."
I just wish we hadn't lost those four months.
but if time was what you needed just to gain a little perspective...
We were on a break.
Coffee house? You bet.
And for the record, it took two people to break up this relationship..
Yeah. You and that girl from that copy place, which yesterday you took full responsibility for.
I didn't know what I was taking full responsibility for. Okay?
I didn't finish the whole letter.
What?  I fell asleep.
You fell asleep?
It was 5:30 in the morning.
And you had rambled on for 18 pages.
Front and back.
By the way, Y-O-U-apostrophe-R-E means "you are."
Y-O-U-R means "your."
You know I can't believe I even thought about getting back together again. We are so over..
Fine by me.
Those little spelling tips will come in handy when you're at home on Saturday nights...
playing Scrabble with Monica..
Sorry.
I just feel bad about all that sleep you're gonna miss wishing you were with me.
No...don't you worry about me falling asleep.
I still have your letter.
And hey. Just so you know, it's not that common.
It doesn't happen to every guy.
And it is a big deal..
I knew it.
Gin.
We were playing gin?
You know if we were a couple, we could play this game naked.
Would you stop? Okay. All right.
Okay. All right.
I think you're great.
I think you're sweet, and you're smart...
and I love you.
But you will always be the guy who peed on me.
Wow. That ripped.
That ripped real nice!
How many times do I have to tell you? You turn and slide.
Turn and slide.
You don't turn and slide.
You throw it out!
I'm tired of having to get a tetanus shot every time I get dressed!
Look, we're not throwing it out! I built this thing with my own hands!
How about we sell it?
All right.
But, you're gonna have to tell them.
Do you mind if we stick you in another cabinet? They seem all right with it!
Friends S04E02  The one with the cat
Hey, Monica. It's Chip.
Who's Chip?
Good running into you at the bank today
so here's my number, 555-9323. Give me a call. Later.
"Chip" is Chip Matthews.
The guy who took Rachel to the prom? Why is he calling you?
Because I ran into him at the bank. He is still so cute.
Monica, you're so lucky! He's like the most popular guy in school!
I know!
Chip? Hi, it's Monica.
Okay, good-bye.
Oh, my God! We just had the best conversation!
I was just leaving.
Good.
Because I've got a product report to read
It's like eight pages, I hope I don't fall asleep.
Why? Did you write it?
Look at that!
Chip Matthews called. I wonder what he wants.
Well, actually...
I bet he sensed that I was ready to have sex with another guy.
Why don't you give him a call?
Okay!
Are you sure you want to hear this? I'm sure.
Chip! Hi, it's Rachel.
Rachel Greene.
Yeah, You left me a message?
Yes, you did. My roommate wrote it down.
Monica Geller?
Oh, that's right!
He called to ask out Monica.
That's got to be embarrassing.
Dumb drunken bitch
Thank you! Thanks!
Hey, here's a question
where did you guys get the finest oak East of the Mississippi?
First you tell us where you got the prettiest lace in all the land.
I'm reading your ad.
Looks good?
"Stunning entertainment center, fine...
Fine Italian craftsmanship."
Oh my God, you guys are selling the entertainment center?
Why? I love it.
You want it? No.
Gepetto?
Five thousand dollars?
Are you insane?
Hey, the ad alone cost 300 bucks!
All right look, I'm changing it to 50 bucks, or your best offer.
What kind of profit is that? And you call yourself an accountant?
No?
What do you do?
I can't believe you don't know what I do for a living!
Yeah, I actually don't know
Oh, my God, no! Shoo, kitty!
Come on, you!
Crazy!
Oh, my God! What?
Nothing. Nothing.
What? What's wrong?
I just, I just have this really strong feeling that this cat is my Mother.
You mean the mom you met in Montauk. She was a cat.
No. She was a human lady.
This is the spirit of my mom, Lilly. The one that killed herself.
Are you sure she's in the cat, or have you been taking your grandma's glycoma medicine again?
No, Dr. Skeptismo.
I'm sure. First of all, okay, there's the feeling.
Okay, and for another, how about the fact that she went into my guitar case
which is lined with orange felt.
My mother's favorite fish was orange roughy.
Cats like fish.
Hi, Mommy!
I haven't seen this smile in 17 years.
Dude, Phoebe's mom has got a huge peni... Let it go!
When were you gonna tell me that you're going out with Chip Matthews?
Now?
Is it okay if I go out with Chip Matthews?
No. It's not okay! I can't believe you would want to after what he did to me!
What, that little thing at the prom?
Monica! I couldn't find him for two hours! He was having sex with Amy Welch!
Come on, that was back in high school! How could that still bother you?
I mean why, of all people would you want to go out with Chip?!
Look, you and I went to different high schools...
Okay, that doesn't help me, because we went to the same high school.
You went to one where you were popular.
and you got to ride off Chip's motorcycle, and wear his letterman jacket.
I went to one where I wore a band uniform they had to have specially made.
They had to have that specially made?!
It was a project for one of the Home Ec classes.
Oh my God, they told us that was for the mascot!
Back then, I thought that I would never, ever get the chance to go out with a Chip Matthews.
and now he's-he's called me up and asked me out.
And the fat girl inside of me really wants to go. I-I owe her this.
I never let her eat.
You go out with him. Really?
Just, if it's possible, could you leave him somewhere and go have sex with another guy?
I'll try.
So you guys having any luck getting rid of the entertainment center?
Well, there were a couple of calls last night, but ah, I don't think any of them are gonna work out.
Yes, Joey has a very careful screening process.
Apparently, not everyone is qualified to own wood and nails.
Stop it! Stop it!
She keeps squirming, trying to get away! Just like when she was alive.
So Pheebs, how long is your mom gonna be with us?
I'm not sure.
I mean, I guess until she You know, gets used to the fact that there's...
a new mom.
I think she's worried that You know, she's gonna, she's gonna be replaced.
That's not going to happen, is it?
Okay, I have to return a call in the other room.
Why can't you use the phone in here?
Well, I'm returning a call from a certain mom at the B-E-A-C-H.
I just spelled the wrong word.
So, guys, am I crazy, or does Phoebe's mom remind anyone of a cat?
Ross, don't start. Come on.
You can't tell me you actually believe that-that there's a woman inside that cat!
I believe it.
No, you don't.
Yes, I do.
No, you...
You know what?
You won't suck me into this.
Oh sure I am, because you always have to be right.
I do not always have...Okay, okay.
Jurassic Park could happen.
That's pretty nice.
"Pretty nice"?
You'll have to pardon my roommate, he wanted to marry this.
We don't have 50 bucks, but would you be willing to trade for it?
We got a canoe.
You know, I, I really don't think we need a canoe.
You gotta take the canoe!
All right, just, just take the entertainment center.
and then when you get home, throw the canoe away!
We're not throwing it away! I built that canoe!
Good for you!
You guys, you're never gonna believe what I just found tacked up on a telephone pole!
Look kinda familiar?
Apparently Phoebe's mother also goes by the name "Julio".
You guys, there's a little girl in Soho looking for this cat. I mean, you know what that means?!
Yeah! $200 reward split five ways!
Do we have to tell her?
Yes, we have to tell her!  Oh, but it's made her so happy.
Little girl misses her cat.
Crazy lady thinks her mother is in a cat.
Okay, You know what, I have to go have dinner with my son.
Can I trust that when you see Phoebe, you will tell her.
Thank you.
I hate when Ross is right.
He is right, isn't he?
You know what, I think this might be one of the times he's wrong.
You think? Oh, no. He's right.
Pheebs, about your mom...
How's that going?
So great. We took a nap together today.
and my Mom fell asleep on my tummy and purred.
That's so sweet.
I'm gonna get some coffee.
What'd you say, Joe? I'll be right there.
Pheebs...I just feel so...
All right! I'm coming already!
Not yet, not yet, not yet...
Hello, Chip. Hey, Rach! How you doing?
I'm great!
I've got a great job at Bloomingdale's, have wonderful friends.
and eventhough I'm not seeing anyone right now, I've never felt better about myself.
So, Monica ready yet?
She'll be out in a second.
So, Chip, how's Amy Welsh?
Amy Welsh? I haven't seen her since...
So, Monica about ready?
This is the unit for you my friend.
Sturdy construction, tons of storage compartments,
Some big enough to fit a grown man.
What? Yeah, I got in there myself once.
My roommate bet me five bucks that I couldn't.
and then he stuck a board through the handles that locked me in.
It was funny 'til I started feeling like I was in a coffin.
No, you can't fit in that thing. That's not deep enough.
Oh, yeah?
If I can't...
I'll knock five bucks off the price off the unit.
All right, you have yourself a deal.
See? I told you.
Sometimes I get in here just to get away from it!
Hey, a nickel!
Here we are.
Oh my God! You still have the Chipper!
The what?
That's what we used to call your ah, your motorcycle in high school.
You know how a motorcycle is a Chopper.
and you're Chip. Nevermind.
Never mind.
I think it's cute.
A lipper from Chipper.
So you still in touch with anyone from high school?
Well, there's Rachel, and...
that's it. How about you?
I still hang with Simmons and Zana, You know. I see Spindler a lot. Devane, Kelly.
and I run into Goldie from time to time.
Steve Brown, Zuchoff, McGwire, J.T., Breadsly.
J.T., Beardsley.
Is that all?
You know after high school, you just kinda lose touch.
Oh yeah! I ran into Richard Dorfman.
How is he? Not so good, Simmons and I gave him a wedgie.
Isn't he an architect now?
Yeah, they still wear underwear.
Oh, my God!
What?
Are you all right? Yeah.
What happened?
Oh, man, he promised he wouldn't take the chairs!
What the hell happened? How were you locked in? And where the hell is all of our stuff?
Well, this guy came by to look at the unit...
and-and he said he didn't think big enough to fit a grown man!
So you got in voluntarily?
I was trying to make a sale!
If I ever run into that guy again, do you know what I'm gonna do?
Bend over?
And then Zana just let one rip!
Look, not that I enjoy talking about people who I went to high school...
because I do.
but, maybe we could talk about something else?
Like you, I don't even know where you work?
You know where I work. I do?
The movie theater. You used to come in all the time.
You still work at the multiplex?
Oh, like I'd give up that job!
Free popcorn and candy, anytime I want.
I can get you free posters for your room.
Thanks, I'm set.
Do you still live with your parents?
Oh yeah, but I can stay out as late as I want.
They really got you guys. Your T.V. The chairs.
Yeah, your microwave. The stereo.
Man, he took the five of spades!
No, here it is.
Oh, my God! What happened?
Joey was born, and then 28 years later, I was robbed!
So how was your date?
Well, You know how I always wanted to go out with Chip Matthews in high school?
Well, tonight, I actually went out with Chip Matthews in high school.
Honey, I'm sorry.
No, it's okay, not only did I get to go out with Chip Matthews...
I got to dump Chip Matthews.
That's so great! I know.
So, what did the insurance company say?
They said, "You don't have insurance here, so stop calling us."
You didn't tell her?
Okay, fine.
Pheebs? Listen...
this cat belongs to a little girl.
There are flyers all over the place.
I'm sorry, sweetie.
Hey, we can take her back with you if you want.
But, you know, she chose to find me.
I mean, I have to respect her decision. Right?
That's a good call. Right.
No! No! Look--Hey, enough is enough!
Look, I am sorry that you feel guilty or whatever about spending time with your new mom
but this is not your old mom.
This is a cat! Okay?
Julio the cat! Not mom! Cat!
Not Mom! Cat.
Ross, how many parents have you lost?
None.
Okay, then you don't know what it feels like when one of them comes back. Do you?
I believe this is my mother.
Even if I'm wrong, who cares?
Just be a friend, okay? Be supportive.
I'm sorry.
Okay.
I don't know what to say.
You could say...you're sorry to her mom.
I think she would like that.
Come here. Here, come here.
Mrs. Buffay?
Sorry about what I said.
It was insensitive of me to say...
that you were just a cat...
when, clearly, you are also...
the reincarnated spirit...
of my friend's mother.
Thank you.
We both forgive you.
So honey, what are you gonna do about the little girl?
Yeah, okay, listen
Mom, I hope you know you still mean a lot to me.
And you're welcome to come back anytime.
Pheebs, if she could come back as a couch, we'd really appreciate it.
Come on, Mom, I'll take you home.
I'll go with you.Me too.
You know, I've got an extra futon.
Dude, you don't have to brag! We got nothing here!!
Hey, We are so in luck!
Treeger said that we could have all this cool stuff from the basement.
Wait right there.
Oh, no. I'm paddling away.
Really?! We get all this rusty crap for free?
This and a bunch of bubble wrap. And, some of it is not even popped!
Could we be more white trash?
Friends S04E03  The one with the "cuffs"
How desperate am I?
Good thing Chandler's not here, he always wins at this game.
I just told my Mom I'd cater a party for her.
How come? -Because I need the money
and I thought that it'd be a great way to get rid of that last little schmidgen of self-respect.
Come on, I think this is a good thing.
I don't think Mom would've hired you if she didn't think you were good at what you do.
You don't have to stick up for her. She can't hear you.
Do you have any juice?
Just pickle.
Hey, Rach, funny story. I, bumped into Joanna on the street yesterday.
My boss, Joanna? That must have been awkward.
Well, no, actually she uh, asked me if I wanted to get a drink.
You, you didn't say 'Yes' to that did you?
No! No!
Hello, Rachel.
Well, not at first.
What is she doing here?
I don't understand! Last time you went out with her you said she was a 'big, dull dud.'
Well, I think I judged her too quickly,
and this time we were able to take the relationship to the next level.
Well, last time I almost got fired. You must end it, you must end it now!
Oh, come on! It's not like this is an everyday occurrence for me!
I mean usually I'm pretty much just in there by myself.
Chandler! Promise me.
you will end this now.
Okay, I promise, I'll end it. Thank you.
I hope you know what I'm giving up for you
because she's not just the boss in your office, if you know what I mean.
Sorry. I knew what he meant.
How's the hired help?
Doing great. Quiches are coming along.
What's this? Blue nail polish?
Yeah, I thought it was cute.
Ha. It's what your grandmother's hands looked like when we found her.
Let me ask you a question.
Why did you hire me?
Well Richard raved about the food at his party...
of course you were sleeping with him.
Then I heard the food at that lesbian
wedding was very nice.
I assume you weren't sleeping with anybody there.
Though, at least that would be something.
Oh, my God! Did you hear that?
She hired me because she thinks I'm good.
I didn't hear that.
Oh yeah, she didn't hire me out of pity.
it wasn't so she could pick on me in front of her friends,
she actually thinks I'm good.
Wow! And hey, it's cool if you're a lesbian!
Good afternoon, are you the decision maker of the house?
Do you currently own a set of encyclopedias?
No, but try the classifieds. People sell everything in there.
Actually, I'm not buying. I'm selling.
Let me ask you one question.
Do your friends ever have a conversation...
and you just nod along, even though you're not really sure what they're talking about?
I'm telling you, it's totally unconstitutional.
I hear you. Yeah it is. I totally agree.
I think he deserves a Nobel Prize.
No.
It was like the Algonquin kids table.
Excuse me. I'm sorry.
You haven't said anything for about two minutes.
Are you at all interested?
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, oh, yeah. Come on in.
That's weird. What?
Your nails.
I know, I never wear fake ones.
I just did it so my Mom wouldn't give me grief about me biting them.
No, I meant that it's weird that you only have nine now.
Oh, my God!
Wait a minute.
I had them when I put...
Oh, my God! It's in the quiche!
Oh, my God! Okay, don't panic.
I'm gonna go to the store, I'm gonna get you another set of nails.
No one's gonna know, and you're gonna look great.
Oh. Oh, it's because they're gonna eat... That's the problem.
Honey, don't bite your nails.
Okay, please don't freak out.
but, there's a blue fingernail in one of the quiche cups.
And there's no way to know which one.
And whoever finds it wins the prize!
I'm not freaking out.
Then why are you laughing? It's nothing, it's just that now your Father owes me five dollars.
What? You bet I'd lose a nail?
Don't be silly. I just bet that I'd need these.
Frozen lasagnas? Mm.
You bet that I'd screw up?
So all that stuff about hiring me because I was good was...
No, that was all true.
This was just in case you "pulled a Monica."
You promised Dr. Weinburg, you'd never use that phrase.
Oh honey, come on, have a sense of humour
you've never been able to laugh at yourself.
That's right.Ha, ha.
My mom doesn't have any faith in me. Oh, that's hilarious.
I don't get it.
No. I have faith.
No. You have lasagnas!
The ruined quiches are ready.
It just doesn't...feel like we're breaking up.
No, we are. I'm sad.
Okay!
Yes.
Can't you wait until tomorrow? All right.
Unbelievable!
Thanks.
No, no, that was my boss. I have to go.
What are you doing?
I'm getting dressed. Why?
When I walk outside naked people throw garbage at me.
Wait. I want to show you something.
What is it?
Just a little gag gift somebody gave me.
Put your hands together.
You're not the boss of me.
Yeah, you are.
Saucy!
I'll be back in two minutes.
You're going to leave me like this?
Knowing you're here waiting for me. I think that's kind of exciting.
Okay. But if you don't come back soon...
there's pretty much nothing I can do about it!
I brought you back a macaroon!
Oh great! I'll keep it in my butt with your nose.
That's weird. She locked the door.
You know why? She's got the Christmas bonus list in there.
I saw her working on it this morning.
Okay, swear you won't tell.
but when Mark left he gave me a key to Joanna's office.
You want to see the list? Yeah.
Hi.
How are you?
Hello, Joanna...
...'s office.
I'm really sorry but I may be a little while longer.
How little? A couple of hours, I feel awful.
Look, this isn't funny! You get back here right now!
I can't! Why not?
I'm in my boss's car!
What?  Tunnel!
What?
Rachel, could I see you for a moment?
Okay, here's the situation...
The keys to the cuffs are on the back of the door.
Could you be a doll...
and grab them and scoot on over here and unlock me?
And on a totally different subject, that is a lovely pantsuit.
You promised you would break up with her.
I did break up with her! She just took it really, really well!
And the fact that you were jeopardising my career never entered your mind?!
It did enter my mind.
But then something happened that made it shoot right out.
You know what Chandler, you got yourself into those cuffs, you get yourself out of them.
No..I can't get myself right out of them!
You must have me confused with the "Amazing Chandler"!
Come on, you have to unlock me,
she could be gone for hours, and I'm cold, and...
Ugh! Chandler. All right! This is it!
Never see her again.
Never!
You never come into this office again! Fine!
You give me back my Walkman!
I...never borrowed your Walkman.
Well, then I lost it. You buy me one!
You got it! Here we go! Come on! This is great!
Does it hurt?
No, I just always see guys doing this when they get handcuffs taken off them.
Hello, sweet pants!
Wait a minute! What are you gonna tell Joanna?
About what?
When she sees that you're gone, she's gonna know that I let you out,
and that I was in here, and I'm gonna get fired!
I'll make something up! I'm good at lying!
I actually did borrow your Walkman!
No, there's nothing to make up, she's gonna know that I have a key to her office.
I've got to get you locked up back the way you were!
Oh, I don't think so.
Well, this is much better.
So, here's somebody interesting, Joey.
What do you know about Van Gogh?
He cut off his ear. And?
I'm out.
He painted that.
That's pretty nice.
I thought he cut off his ear because he sucked.
What else you got in there? Let's see...
Where does the Pope live? In the woods.
No wait-wait, that's the joke answer.
Actually, it's Vatican City.
Now, what do you know about vulcanized rubber?
Spock's birth control.
You need these books.
Hey.  Hi.
This used to be your room?
Wow. Oh, you must have been in really good shape as a kid.
I'm such an idiot!
I can't believe I thought she could change.
Well, who cares what your Mom thinks?
So you "pulled a Monica."
Good, I'm glad that's catching on.
No but, why does that have to be a bad thing. Just change what it means.
You know? Go down there and prove your Mother wrong.
Finish the job you were hired to do, and we'll call that "pulling a Monica."
What?
Okay, if a kid gets straight A's, his parents would say,
"Yeah, he pulled a Monica." You know?
Or a fireman saves a baby, and they go, "Yeah I know, he pulled a Monica."
Or someone hits a homerun and the announcer says, "Yeah, that one's outta here."
Because some things don't change.
All right. I'll go down there.
But, I'm not gonna serve the lasagna. I'm gonna serve something I make.
My breasts are really strong.
Chandler, please, I have to get you locked up back the way you were, I am sooo gonna lose my job!
She's very private about her office!
Now I know why!
Look, you're in trouble either way! Okay?
If she comes back and sees me locked to this instead of the chair...
she's gonna know you were in here. So you might as well just let me go.
What if I clean your bathroom for a month? It still wouldn't be clean.
All I want is my freedom.
Foot rubs for a month! Freedom!
I'll take all of your photos and put them into photo albums! Freedom! I want my freedom!
Why won't you hear me! Sophie, help me!
Sophie, sit!
No! God, would you just calm down!
I'm gonna say this for the last time.
Would you please just...
There's a lot I didn't know about vomit.
In a minute.
So what do you say? Joe?
You get the whole set of encyclopedias for twelve hundred dollars
That works out to just 50 bucks a book.
Twelve hundred dollars?
You think I have $1200?
I'm home during the day...
and I got patio furniture in my living room.
I guess there's a few things you don't get from book learnin'.
Well, what can you swing?
How about zero down and zero a month for a long, long time?
You don't have anything?
You want to see what I got? Okay!
I've got a baby Tootsie Roll...
a movie stub, keys, a Kleenex...
a rock...
and an army man.
Okay, I get the picture. Thanks for your time.
And a fifty.
These must be Chandler's pants.
For 50 bucks, you can get one book!
What will it be? A? B? C?
I think I'm gonna stick with the V.
I want to see how this bad boy turns out. Heh.
I, will buy and wrap all of your Christmas gifts. No.
I...I'll squeeze you fresh orange juice every morning!
With extra pulp? Yeah.
No!
I've got it!
You don't have it.
I have so got it!
There's gonna be rumours about this, there's no way to stop it.
Sophie knows, Monica and Phoebe know.
How do Monica and Phoebe know? I called them.
And when they ask me what I saw...
I can be very generous...
or very stingy.
Go on.
I can make you a legend.
I can make you this generatiors Milton Berle.
And Milton erle has a... Not compared to you.
They're not even touching the lasagna!
Really? Oh, they love your casserole.
Yes!
It's hard to believe that just a little while ago this was nothing but ingredients.
Well, everyone seems to be enjoying your dish.
And you?
I thought it was...
quite tasty.
So if everyone liked it, and you liked it...
that would make this a success. Which would make you…
A bitch?
Well, I was going for "wrong", but we can use your word.
Yes, well, I was wrong.
And I have to say...
you really impressed me today.
You might even say that she "pulled a Monica."
She doesn't know we switched it.
And the next time you cater for me...
there will be nothing but ice in the freezer.
Well, That really means a lot.
Mom, don't bite your nails!
Hello. Hey.
Hello, Chandler.
I love you.
What's going on?
No, he doesn't!
Two hours, that lasted.
So did you break up with Joanna?
I think so.
Well, it's good thing you got out when you did, before she blew up like that Vesuvius.
The volcano? Yeah.
Yeah. And speaking of volcanoes, man are they a violent igneous rock formation.
What?
Oh yeah, lava spewing, hot ash,
of course some are dormant.
Why are you talking about volcanoes all of the sudden?
Well, we can talk about something else.
What do you want to talk about? Vivisection?
The Vasdeferens?
The Vietnam War?
Did anybody see that-that documentary on the Korean War?
Korea's a beautiful country.
With such a sad history. Yeah.
Could there be more Kims?
Who's out there? It's me, Good morning.
Rachel, could you come in here for a moment, please?
Yeah, sure. they didn't have poppy seed bagels,
so I have sesame...Oh, my word!
I seem to have had a slight office mishap.
Could you please get the key off the back of the door for me.
Yeah, yeah! Okay!
I'm so sorry.
You tell your friend Chandler that we're definately broken up this time.
Okay.
Hey! New wallet, huh?
Yeah, It was time. The old condom ring in the leather just doesn't say 'cool' anymore.
Rachel, you just put an empty carton back in the fridge.
I know, but the garbage was full.
Have you ever taken out the trash?
Well, I thought you liked doing it.
Third door on the left. Right!
Hey, Mr. Treeger.
What are you doing?
I'm sorry.
It's a little old but…
No! You're clogging up the chute that I spent a half-hour unclogging!
I'm sorry.  I didn't—I don't come in here a lot.
Oh yeah, of course you don't! 'Cause you're a little princess!
Daddy, buy me a pizza.
Daddy, buy me a candy factory.
Daddy, make the cast of Cats sing "Happy Birthday" to me.
You think you can come here...
make a mess and the big man in coveralls will come in here and clean it up, huh?
Well, why don't think of someone else for a change?
Okay, I'm sorry.
God, if you're going to cry about it!
Friends S04E04  The one with the ballroom dancing
Whoa, whoa! Treeger made you cry?
Yes! And he said really mean things that were only partly true.
I'm gonna go down there and teach that guy a lesson.
Joey, please don't do that. I think it's best that we just forget about it.
That's easy for you to say. You weren't almost just killed!
All right, that's it. School is in session!
My God! Is this a gym card?
Oh, yeah, gym member.
I try to go four times a week, but I've missed the last...
1200 times.
So why don't you quit?
You don't think I've tried?
You think I like having 50 dollars taken out of my bank account every month?
No, they make you go all the way down there!
Then they use all of these phrases and peppiness to try and confuse you!
And then they bring out Maria.
Who is Maria? Oh, Maria!
You can't say no to her.
she's like this lycra spandex covered gym…treat.
Do you need me to go with you and hold your hand?
No!  So you're strong enough to face her on your own?
Oh no, you'll have to come.
Tribbiani. Hold on.
I'll get the plunger.
You hold on pal! Now you made my friend, Rachel, cry.
So now, you're gonna go up there and apologize to her...
unless you want me to call the landlord.
And tell him what?
Have you heard about a little something called "not making girls cry."
Yeah. Well maybe you have heard about the Rent Stabilization Act of 1968!
I have actually not heard of that.
Yeah, well your friends are in violation of it.
I've been a nice guy up until now, but, I don't need this grief.
I'm gonna call the landlord...
and tell him that Monica is illegally subletting here grandmother's apartment.
Your friends are out of here, pal.
Why don't you tell me something I don't know!
Oh please, somebody tell me I don't have to go to work today!
What's the matter?
My first massage today is this incredibly gorgeous guy.
and every time I see him I just want to...
do things to him that I'm not allowed to charge for.
So do them for free.
No, it is forbidden.
No-no, Mrs. Potter fires people for fooling around with clients.
And it's against my oath as a masseuse.
They make you take an oath? No, I made myself take an oath.
Yeah, no fooling around with clients...
and always be prepared.
Yeah, that one's actually from the Boy Scouts, but it just makes good sense.
Why don't you just give him to somebody else?
No, I can handle it. No, I'm a professional.
Oh Pheebs, is that a new ankle bracelet?
And you got a petticure. Your feet are all dressed up.
Because that's the only part of you he can see when he's on the table!
You're gonna do some feet flirting!
I don't know what you're talking about.
Then how do you explain the toe ring?!
Because it's Arabian princess day at work! Okay?! Leave me alone!
My hero! What happened?
Well, I went down there and told him that no one treats my friends like that.
and that he'd better come up here and apologize. I'll see you later.
Wait a minute.
What did he say?
He said that he wasn't gonna apologize because you guys are living here illegally.
so instead what he's gonna do is have you evicted-I'll see you later.
What?! You got us evicted! I told you not to go down there!
He made Rachel cry!
Rachel always cries!
That's not true!
You go down there and you suck up to him
I mean you suck like you've never sucked before!
All right, I'll try.
But if I can't, you can stay with Chandler and I until you get settled.
Go! All right, all right.
I mean I'll have to check with him first, but I'll think he'll be cool with it.
Now remember what we talked about, you gotta be strong.
Yes! Yes!
One more time.
"Hey, don't you want a washboard stomach and rock hard pecs?"
No! I want a flabby gut and saggy man breasts!
Good! That's good.
I want to quit the gym.
You want to quit?
I want to quit the gym.
You do realize that you won't have access to our new full service Swedish spa.
I want to quit the gym.
Okay, Dave in the membership office, handles quitters.
Excuse me. Are you a member?
Me?
No!
Sorry. Members only.
I want to quit the gym!
It's okay, man. Be strong.
So, are you a member of any gym.
No! And I'm not gonna be, so you can save you little speech.
Okay, no problem.
Could you come here for a second?
Hi, I'm Maria.
You have really pretty feet.
These old things.
Would you mind spending some time on my siadic area, it's been killing me today.
You mean the...
Okay by siadic, you mean the...
towel-covered portion?
Sure, yeah, no I can do that, yeah.
because, you know, the muscles in the siadic area can get you know...
real nice and tight.
So tell me, Rick, how did you injure the area?
A 16-hour sit-in for Greenpeace.
Did you just bite me? No!
What?
Please don't kick Monica and Rachel out, this wasn't there fault, it was mine.
You want me to kick you guys out instead?
No you can't do that, where would the chick and the duck live?
You have pets? No! no!
Those are nicknames.
I'm the "chick," and Chandler's the "duck."
I would've thought it was the other way around.
Come on man, just-just let the girls stay.
I'll do whatever you want.
Really? You'd do anything?
Yeah, absolutely.
Yeah, I've got something you can do.
What is it?
Can you be my dancing partner?
That's not prison lingo, is it?
His dancing partner?
Yeah, there's this superintendent's dance "The Super Ball."
and he wants to impress Marge, this lady super that he's a crush on.
Well, why doesn't he practice with a girl?
Well, he's too shy
He doesn't thing he's good enough to dance with girls yet.
Yeah, right.
He almost danced me right down that garbage chute.
Would you let it go already? You're fine.
So, did you quit?
No, I almost did.
couldn't leave Ross there without a spotter!
Wait, now so you joined the gym?
And that's funny, why?
I was just, you know, picturing you working out, and...
Well, that's it.
We're doomed. Okay,
They're gonna take 50 bucks out of our accounts for the rest of our lives.
What are we gonna do?
Well, you could actually go to the gym.
Or we could go to the bank...
close our accounts and cut them off at the source.
You're a genius.
Oh, man! But then, we won't be bank buddies.
Now there's two reasons.
You guys, remember that cute client I told you about?
I bit him.
Where? On the tushy.
And that's not against your oath?
No, I know! I'm sorry, but the moment I touch him
I just wanna throw out my old oath and take a new, dirty one.
Well, next time your massaging him, you should try and distract yourself.
Yeah! Yeah! like when I'm doing something exciting...
and I don't wanna get too...
excited.
I just, you know try to thing of other things like ah sandwiches...
and baseball...
and Chandler.
Thank you, Joey. Oh, no, thank you.
All right, I'm here. Let's get this over with.
Okay, well...
just follow my lead.
Don't we need to do some kind of preparation first?
Like get really drunk?
Come on. Hey, just put your arms around me.
I'm sorry.
No. It's okay. But if I'm Marge...
my breasts are coming out my back.
Forget it! I'm not being any good at this.
My mom was right.
I'm just a big potato with arms and legs and a head.
Come on, man. You're not a potato.
I'm sure as hell not a dancer. It's no use.
Marge will never go for me.
Come on, Treeger. Don't say that.
You just need more practice.
Here, Come on. Let's try it again.
Plus, it was probably mostly my fault anyway.
I mean, you know, I'm not really that comfortable dancing with a...
So how goes the dancing? Gay yet?
You guys owe me bigtime.
What was that?
You just did a little dancy thing.
No, I didn't. Yes, you did.
You did like a little hop.You are soo enjoying this.
No, I'm not.
And it wasn't a hop it was a pademarie.
You know the words!
You are so into this!
All right, well maybe I'm enjoying it a little bit. I mean I'm getting pretty good at it.
This is so sweet. Joey, our little twinkletoes.
Hold on, this isn't some kind of like girly dance.
All right, it's like a sport, it's manly!
All right, then show me some manly moves. All right.
I don't know how to lead.
Hello.
We'd like to close our accounts.
Close your accounts? Is there some kind of problem?
No, we'd just like to close them.
Okay, Ms. Lambert handles all our closures.
Would you come over here please?
Hi, I'm Karen.
I want to quit the bank!
Okay. Baseball.
Rick playing baseball. He slides into second.
Maybe even his pants come down a little.
No, no, wait...
Okay, sandwiches. Sandwiches.
Okay, on a plate.
Maybe Rick's pants come down a little.
Chandler.
Okay, Chandler. That's working!
Chandler's knees.
Chandler's ankles.
Chandler's ankle hair.
Oh, no!
Okay, you're all set.
Wow! That was amazing!
Was that really just an hour? Yeah.
In really long-hour world.
What?
I have an enormous crush on you.
But because you're a client, I can't ask you out...
even though you give me you know, the feeling.
I had no idea.
But you know, I could always find another masseuse.
Really?
Yeah, really.
What?
Suddenly I'm very aware I'm naked.
Okay, quit down.
Mr. Simors been waiting for...Oh, my God!
Why wasn't I offered that?
I'd definitely pay more for that.
Phoebe, we have rules here, this isn't that kind of place.
Oh yeah, oh and I know, but this isn't what it looks like...
because Rick is my...husband.
Oh, really?
Well, then you'd better tell his other wife
because she called three times asking where he is.
Yes, I will tell her.
So you didn't leave the bank?
No! And somehow, we ended up with a joint checking account.
What are you ever gonna use that for?!
To pay for the gym.
So I had a great day.
Rick and I really hit it off, and we started making out,
and then my boss walked in and fired me for being a whore.
You got fired? Oh, my gosh!
It's so weird, I have never been fired from anything before!
Sweetie.
I just started walking around not knowing what to do next.
I started asking people on the street if they wanted massages.
Then these policemen, thought I was a whore too
It's really been a bad day, whore-wise.
Hey, Duck. Is Chick here?
Yeah, Bunny Rabbit.
So you, ready for our last practice?
Yeah, but you know, I think the reason we're not getting that spin right is
because my apartment's too small.
Look, you wanna use our place? No, I had another idea.
We did it!
I know, we did it!! Hey, that was incredible, huh?!
That was amazing! I mean, we totally nailed it, it was beautiful.
Hey, listen. Thanks a lot, Tribbiani.
Oh, my God! Look at the time.
I got to catch the bus to the ball.
Good luck.
Unless you wanna practice the Foxtrot again? Or-or the Tango?
Thanks, but no.
You see, I think I'm ready to dance with girls.
Go get them, Treeger. Right.
You want to come? Marge has a girlfriend.
Really? Yeah!
You could dance real good with her, she's the same size as me.
No, I'm good.
So it looks like you've got some great experience here.
Let's see, reason for leaving last job?
Yeah, they thought I was a whore.
Okay, we'll give a call if anything comes up.
Great! Thank you very much.
Hello!
What's this?
Oh, right! It's that girl's phone number.
There it is. Just a phone number...
a really hot girl gave me.
It's no big deal. I mean, it is her home phone number, but...
Almost lost this baby!
The lovely Amanda gives me her number, and I go and drop it.
Thank you.
Friends S04E05  The one with Joey's new girlfriend 
Rachel? Yeah?
When's your birthday? May fifth, why?
I'm just making a list of people's birthdays.
Mine's December... Yeah, whatever.
She's pretty!
Pretty, pretty girl. The pretty...She's pretty.
Go ask her out.
What's the worst that could happen? I could die.
Yeah, it's tough being single.
That's why I'm so glad I found Amanda.
Ross, you guys went out once.
You took your kids to Chuck E. Cheese, and you didn't even kiss her.
I tell people secrets.
It makes them like me.
Phoebe.
You're sick, you shouldn't play. You should just go home, get in bed, and stay there.
But I'm unemployed.
my music is all I really have now.
Well music, and making my own shoes. Pretty, huh?
All right, I'm gonna do it.
I'm gonna go get shot down.
Any advice?
Just be yourself...
but not too much.
Wish me luck.
Good luck!
Wish it!
Hi, I was just sitting over there and...
Chandler. My name is Chandler. Did I say that?
No, you didn't. Hi, I'm Kathy.
Kathy with a K or a C? With a K.
You are really good at this!
Hey, come on, give me a break, I'm out on a limb here.
I'm sorry, you're right, I apologize.
But I should tell you, I'm waiting for a date.
And there he is now!
I see you guys already met.
Yes-yes, I was just trying to figure out a way to...
demonstrate how I could get my exceptionally large feet...
into my even bigger mouth.
Didrt I tell you?
Always showing off.
Before I start, I just wanna say that, I have a cold.
So if I sneeze in the middle of song, it's not on purpose.
Except the last verse of "Pepper People."
Smelly cat, smelly cat
What are they feeding you?
This chick sounds good.
Smelly cat
Hey Gunther, be a good little boy and bring me a whiskey.
Jeez, at 2:30 in the morning, I didn't expect to have to fight over the remote.
I'm sorry, it's just this Ernie Cofax thing on in a few minutes I wanted to watch.
Oh my God! That's why I got up too!
You're kidding? I love him!
Hey, listen, I'm sorry about this afternoon, if I would've known you guys were...I never would've...
Oh, please.
So, Joey tells me you two met in acting class.
Yeah, they teamed us up as partners. Joey picked three scenes for us to do.
all of them had us making out.
That's a good thing actually, because ah, he used to have me rehearse with him.
Is it on? No, but this Wonder Broom is amazing!
Oh, my God!
It's on!
Here we go, little fella.
What about the duck?
The duck can swim.
My sticky shoes
My sticky, sticky shoes
Why you stick on me?
Baby
Thanks for the lights, honey.
Way to go!
Your cold makes you sound great.
It's fun. God, I love how sexy I am!
Kath, we should get going. We're going to buy hamsters.
I love them.
No, it's not like that. I work for a medical researcher.
Well, have fun. Okay.
Well, I think it's great that the medical community is finally trying to help sick hamsters.
You know what? I like Kathy. Yeah.
Yeah! me too! She's so cool and pretty.
She is.
She's smart and funny.
you know? We were up all last night talking, she said the funniest thing about...
What?
You love her.
No, I don't.
Yes, you do. Chandler loves Kathy.
Come on, Pheebs just lay off him. Thank you. Ross.
Yeah, he's a little sensitive right now, because he's so in love.
All right.
Kathy, I love you!
So, I need to write some depressing stuff to go along with my new floozy voice
but nothing that sad has ever really happened to me.
How about your mom dying?
Or having to live on the streets when you were 14?
I could write about the time my hair did that "Woo-hoo" thing.
So I'm going over to Amanda's tonight!
Rachel's not here.
How's it going with her?
Great, actually. I'm thinking tonight may be the night.
I mean, the kids are gonna play together and then when they're asleep...
I'm thinking Amanda and I break open a bottle of wine...
do a little playing ourselves.
Hi, guys! This is Josh.
Josh, these are my friends.
And that's Ross.
Hi, Josh.
Dudes.
So, did you play in college?
I still do. Next year, I hope to make varsity.
Ross, didn't you ah, play soccer in High School?
No, wait. that's right. You just organized their game schedules on your Commodore 64.
Well, it's getting late, I've got to get to the game, so I'm gonna...head
I'll miss you.
Dope!
Wow! Cute one.
Very cute. I know. Isn't he great?
So nice to finally be in a fun relationship, you know?
There's nothing boring about him.
and, I bet he's never set foot in a museum.
Well maybe he'll get to go soon
Like on a class trip or something.
You know what else is great about him?
what is the word for the adult...
that doesn't have dinosaur toys in their bedroom?
What was that?
Monica knows.
It's this dumb thing that Ross made up to try to fool our parents.
It's a way of giving the finger without actually having to give it.
I remember I cried the night you made it up.
because it was the first time that I realized that I was actually cooler than my older brother.
Well, I'm gonna go get ready...
for my date tonight...
so I'll just "head."
Yeah, I should go too. because I'm playing in one hour.
You guys should come hear me.
Hear me.
My sticky shoes
I lost my sexy phlegm!
Hi, Ben.
You look great! Thanks.
Hey, Tommy!
I am so glad that you could come over tonight.
Oh, no. It's my pleasure.
Okay, well, my cell phone number is right here on the counter.
Please, help yourself to anything in the fridge.
I appreciate this so much. I have been trying to go out with...
this guy for like a month.
I don't mean to be a square, but I'd really appreciate it if you wait and drink your wine...
after the kids are asleep.
Thanks for this. I hope I can do the same for you sometime.
Who wants to make some long-distance calls?
Kathy! Kathy! Hi!
Kathy! Kathy!
Kathy!
Fetch! Fetch it!
Kathy! Kathy!
Kathy!
Kathy!
Kathy!
Chandler, what are you doing here?
I just wanted to say, "Hey!"
Hey.
Okay.
Oh, You're making it sound worse than it actually was.
Her date tipped me $10
Pheebs, what are you doing?
Okay, I wanna be sexy again so I'm trying to catch a cold.
Should be easy. They're pretty common.
Phoebe, You'll catch pneumonia!
Okay, you were right. I'm in love with Joey's girlfriend.
What? Are you serious?
How is that possible? You barely know her.
I don't know. I just...
I can't get her out of my head.
I'm a very bad person. I'm a very, very bad person.
I'm a horrible person.
"No you're not Chandler! We still love you Chandler!"
Oh gosh, Phoebe, I think I caught your cold.
You mean you stole it!
Don't cover your mouth when you do that!
We were just talking about you.
Really?
Yeah-yeah, I told her about the time you got drunk and fell asleep...
with your head in the toilet.
Right in there!
Ninety-nine...
a hundred. Ready or not, here I come!
All right, let's go over the concept one more time.
Hey guys.  Listen, you wanna get some dinner with me and Kathy tonight?
You know what? I already ate.
It's 4:30.
You know I had a big meal on Monday.
So that's just gonna get me straight through the week.
Okay, I see what's going on here.
You do? Yeah.
You don't like Kathy.
You got me.
Yeah, you've been avoiding her ever since we started going out.
Look, I made an effort to like Janice,
now I think it's your turn to make an effort to like Kathy by going out to dinner with us. Right?
Yeah, right. Good. And hey, my treat.
But that's only because you're not eating anything, right? Right.
Ross isn't here.
Stop it!
So I'll see you at the party?
Beer's beer man, 24, 7!
I am so gonna marry that guy.
What?
I think he's stealing from me. Why?
Because he's stealing from me!
Hi, it's me...
and soup.
I just saw Josh. He looked so yummy in your leather jacket.
Here, now I don't eat chicken, so it's just noodle soup.
And there's no chicken in the broth either, so it's really just... noodle water.
Thank you so much Phoebe. Sure.
What are you doing with those?!
But, I need your germs! I want my cold back!
I miss my sexy voice.
Sorry, Phoebe.
It's okay.
How's the soup?
God, guys, check it out, you can see that girl's underwear!
Is she great, or what?
So? Huh? What do you think?
She's not really my type.
Not your type? She's gorgeous.
You know what I think it is? It's the fishnet stockings.
Whenever I see a girl in fishnet stockings it reminds me of...
my father in fishnet stockings.
Okay. Understanding a little more why you're single.
I have a friend you would like, she's really pretty. And then we could double date!
No, thanks.
Okay, I've got some ugly friends, and they're all available too.
Listen, I-I'm gonna grab a beer.
I'll be right back.
What was that? What?
Kathy was being really nice and you just walked away. I thought we had a deal.
Hey, look, what do you want from me?
I want you to like her.
But if that's too damned difficult for you, then the least you can do is pretend.
I am pretending. Then do it better.
Okay, what do you saw I go over there and say how much I like her?
No-no it'll be good, I can tell her much I've been thinking about her.
That I haven't stopped thinking about her since the moment I met her.
That I'm so fantastically, over-the-top, wanna-slit-my-own-throat...
in love with her, that for every minute of every hour of every day...
I can't believe my own damn bad luck that you met her first!
That's pretty good.
But you might want to tone it down a little.
So Amanda just dropped me off.
That's one of the things I love about her.
She's old enough to drive.
So uhh, I guess you're not going to mom and dad's tonight?
No, sorry.
Well where's Amanda?
Hey Rach, could you get me some cough drops?
I mean you know, I'm thinking. You could bring her...
and you guys could go up to your old room, and not make out.
Ross, cough drops, please?
At least I know she's not going out with me...
to get into R-rated movies.
Why don't you just marry her?
Oh no, wait a minute you can't, I'm sorry I forgot, she's not a lesbian.
You see Amanda and I have a very special... You have nothing!
You're not even going out! You're her baby sitter!
You have a 12-year-old girl's job!
That is so sad.
And what are you laughing at, Miss My-keg-sucking-boyfriend...
is-stealing-from-me?
So he stole a couple bucks from me. Big deal!
At least he got me something with it.
That's mine!
Now, would you both please start acting like adults?
And give me my cough drops!
Fine. Sorry.
Here.
Thank you.
At least I made $ 10 in my relationship.
You know...?
Parading goats are parading
Parading down the street
Parading goats are parading
Leaving little treats
Does it even work without my sexy voice?
I like it.
Gunther, kiss me. What?
Do it, deputy! Do something!
Now, we're not actually gonna be sleeping in her, but do you mind?
Can I sleep on your couch?
And I'm still waiting
For my papier-mache man
Thank you, my babies.
Rachel?
I don't know if you heard about what happened between me and Phoebe the other day?
No.
We kissed. I didn't initiate the kiss, but I also didn't stop it.
and I've been feeling guilty.
Okay.
So...
are we cool?
Okay.
I knew you'd understand.
So,Thanks for the delicious dinner. You're welcome for a delicious dinner.
Hey,What are you guys looking at?
Ross and the most beautiful girl in the world.
Yeah, come to Papa!
I know!
Probably the only time I'll say this...
...but did you see the ass on her?
What did you? When did you?
How did you? How did you get a girl like that?
Yeah, so what is she, like a... like a spokesmodel, or an aerobics instructor, what?
Actually, she's a paleontology doctoral candidate...
...specializing in the Cenozoic Era.
Okay, But that's, like, the easiest era.
I've seen her at work, but I always figured. ah-huh?
But, uh, I made her dinner.
We had a great time. And we're going out again tomorrow.
Well maybe she and her friends are just having a contest to see who can bring home the biggest geek.
Fine by me. Hope she wins.
Friends S04E06  The one with the dirty girl
Hey!
You guys have any wrapping paper?
Oo! Is it for my birthday present?
Phebes, it was your birthday, like, months ago.
Yeah, but remember you said you ordered something special, and it just hasn't come yet?
Well, I have a call in about that.
Actually, this is for Kathy's birthday. It's an early edition of her favorite book.
Oh! The Velveteen Rabbit!
Oh my God, When the boy's love makes the rabbit real...
Okay, but don't touch it, because your fingers have destructive oils.
Huh. Well, then you'd better keep it away from Ross's hair.
So this is pretty rare. How did you get that?
Oh, it wasn't a big deal. I just went to a couple of bookstores, talked to a couple of dealers.
called a couple of the author's grandchildren.
Oh, honey, that's so sweet.
Yeah, and what a great way to say, "I secretly love you, roommate's girlfriend."
It doesn't say that.
Does it?
How do you think it's gonna look when you get her something incredibly meaningful and expensive
and her boyfriend Joey gives her an orange?
Okay, all right, I'll just uh, make sure that uh, Joey gets her something really great.
It's gotta be better than that book.
Ooh! Like a crossbow!
Yeah, Once again, I am sorry.
Thank you. Bye.
I just had to turn down a job catering a funeral for sixty people.
Oh, my God! What happened?
Sixty guests.
So, uh, why did you have to turn it down?
Because I don't have the money or the equipment...
...to handle something that big on such short notice. I mean there's no way.
Wow, what is with all the negativity?
You sound like "Moni-can't," not "Moni-can"!
Moni-ca.
Look, you know, you have been playing around with this catering thing for over three years.
Do you want to be a caterer or not? I don't know.
There you go! That's the spirit!
Okay! Now, if you need money, I will lend you money, but just get moving!
Really? Cause I'd need like $500 for all the food and the supplies and stuff.
Okay! It's worth it, if it'll get you moving. You haven't worked in months!
Well, you're not working either.
Yes, but I'm doing this.
Yeah, that'd be great! Thank you!
Hey! Hey!
Can I borrow the keys to your apartment?
Why?
You can pee here.
haha.. yes I can, of course. Excuse me.
It's okay. The duck's using our bathroom anyway.
Hey Joe! What are you getting Kathy for her birthday?
We've only been going out for a couple of weeks, do you think I gotta get her something?
Yeah!
Yes, you have to get her something, and it should be something really nice.
Oh, I know... And not one of your coupons...
...for an hour of "Joey Love."
Ooh! A crossword! Can I help?
No!
I'm sorry, honey, it's just that last week I got all but three answers ...
...and I really want to finish a whole one without any help.
Fine.
But you can't help me develop my new universal language.
Hey! How'd it go?
Oh, my God! It was the best funeral ever!
I mean, everyone loved the food, and guess what?
I even got another funeral for tomorrow
The dead guy from today's best friend.
I mean, It's like I am the official caterer for that accident.
Mon, I'm so happy for you!
Thanks. Like, check out my new catering stuff.
Look at this! I'm an omelet station!
Omelet? Made to order? Ha!
I'll have one, please. Plus my money.
Oh. Well, I didn't realize that you needed it back right away.
I mean, you told me to go and be a caterer. So I went. I beed.
I... I used it to buy all this stuff.
But look--I've got another job tomorrow, so I'll pay you back with the money I make from that.
Oh. Okay. Oo, sorry I acted like a bank.
Um, would you like to come in?
Did homo-erectus hunt with wooden tools?
According to recent findings.
Here, Mitzi! Here, Mitzi!
Uh, Mitzi is?
My hamster.
I hope she's okay. I haven't seen her in a while.
Have a seat.
"Where?"
Uh, oh! Do you, uh...?
Do you have any, um, Cinnamon Fruit Toasties?
What? Well, I do.
Why don't we go back to my place, light a couple of candles,...
...break open a box of Cinnamon Fruit Toasties, uh...
I'd rather not. Oh, yeah? Why not?
Okay, um... Don't take this the wrong way...
...but your place kinda has a weird smell.
Oh, is everything in the car? Yes. Did you settle the bill?
No. I hate this part.
Oh, look what we almost left.
No, that's not mine.
Oh, all right. Oh! Look what we almost took!
Excuse me, Ms. Burkart?
Well, we're all cleaned up in the kitchen.
Oh. Good. Thank you.
Um, ahem...
Um, and, well there's the.. the the small matter of...
Dear? Just the matter of ...
...payment.
Jack used to handle the finances.
You know what we should all do?
Go see a musical.
Sure.
And you know which one we should see?
The 1996 Tony Award winner.
Do you happen to know the name of that one?
I don't know, um, Grease?
No.
Rent?
Yes! Rent!
Okay, so when do you want to go?
What? Oh, I'm sorry, I can't, I'm busy.
Hey...
Man, it is so hard to shop for girls. Ugh!
Yes, it is, at Office Max!
What did you get her?
A pen.
It's two gifts in one. It's a pen that's also a clock. Huh?
Ha, ha. You can't give her that. Why not?
Because she's not eleven!
And it's not the seventh night of Chanukah.
Okay, honey, what he means by that, is ...while this is a very nice gift...
...maybe it's just not something a boyfriend gives?
Sure, it is.
She needs a pen for work.
She's writing. She turns it over. "Whoa! It's time for my date with Joey!"
All right, look, look. What did... what did you get for Angela Delveccio for her birthday?
She didn't have a birthday while we were going out.
For three years?
Look, it's too late, and I got an audition.
I can't shop anymore! I...
All right. I will go out and I will try to find something for her, okay?
Thanks, man.
And oh, while you're at it, could you get her a card?
Would you like me to write her a little poem as well?
Or just get a card that has a poem already in it.
But Mon, you have to get our money! Oh, Phoebe, she couldn't stop crying!
With those thick glasses, her tears looked giant.
I know, it's tough.
You know what the first thing I did after my mom's funeral was?
What? Pay the caterer!
Look, I've had a lot of jobs, okay,
and there are some people who just always try to get out of paying.
It's either, you know, "That massage wasn't long enough"...
...or, "I don't recognize any of those songs,"
...or, you know, "these sombreros aren't big enough. Bad little white girl!"
Okay.
Okay. So what do you.... you think she's faking?
Well, it seems like there weren't any tears 'til you showed her the bill.
Phoebe, she sounded pretty upset to me.
She seems fine now.
So you just left? Her place was really that bad?
You know how you throw your jacket on a chair at the end of the day?
Well, like that, only instead of a chair, it's a pile of garbage.
And instead of a jacket, it's a pile of garbage.
And instead of the end of the day, it's the end of time...
...and garbage is all that has survived.
Here. Wow. Thanks.
So, uh, what happened?
What do you mean? Nothing happened! I had to get out of there.
All right, so... next time, you take her to your place.
No, I tried that. She says it has a weird smell.
What kind of smell? I don't know. Soap?
All right, listen, Ross... you like this girl, right? Yeah.
You wanna see her again, right?
So you're gonna have to do it in the mess!
Yeah, okay. You're right.
I mean, uh, who... who cares about a little sloppiness?
It's, uh... it's endearing, really. All right!
Now you go get that beautiful pig!
Okay, all right. I just spent the entire afternoon looking for a present...
...for Kathy that would be better than the rabbit.
Any luck?
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I found this great place called "Invisible things for Kathy."
Can you give me a hand with all this stuff?
All right, look. Why don't you just return the book, let Joey give her the clock pen...
...and you get her something worse than that...
...like a regular pen.
She's really going to love this, you know?
The bottom line is I want her to have it...
...even if I don't get to be the one who gives it to her.
Aw, honey, that's so sweet.
Yeah? You don't think it's just pathetic?
Oh, "pathetic"!
I'm meeting Kathy in ten minutes! I've been looking all over for you!
Where? Our place. The hall.I...
I got something for her.
It's a book.
A book?
Is it a book that's also a safe?
No, it's a book that's just a book, okay?
It's an early edition of the Velveteen Rabbit. It was her favorite book as a kid.
So, uh, just let me know if she likes it, okay?
You got it.
Thanks man. Thanks for doing this. I owe you one.
Oh, hey! There wasn't any change from that twenty, was there?
No, it came out to an even twenty.
Wow. That's almost as much as a new book.
You didn't get the money, did you?
Maybe I can try at intermission?
Phoebe, come on... you know what? Let's just go!
No! Hey, we're not leaving until we get paid!
I don't know who she thinks she is!
Enough is enough!
Okay, Widow!
Widow? Excuse me? Excuse me!
Thanks. Um, clearly this is a very, very hard time for you.
Um, but we provided a service, and we deserve to be paid...
...because you ate that service.
and, um, we are not leaving here until we're paid every penny. ...
'Cause you know what, lady? We're part time caterers, and we have no place else to go.
All right. I'll get my bag.
Good.
I'm gonna leave some cards here.
Please think of us for your next event.
So you want to come inside?
Yes.
Yes, I do.
I'll be right back. Make yourself comfortable.
Guess who. Uh...
Department of Sanitation?
It's me. Ha, oh!
Aw!
What?
Oh, Cheryl! Oh, Ross!
Oh! God!
Aah! Oh, my God!
No! No!
Wait! No! No! It's my hamster! It's Mitzi!
Oh my god! I'm so sorry, Cheryl. I must have freaked out.
Oh, thank god, it's not Mitzi.
It's just a rat.
I did it! Aah!
I finished it! I did it all by myself!
And there's nobody to hug.
Move!
Hey! Hey, you guys!
I finished the crossword all by myself! Hug me.
Uh... yay!
Oh, that's great! Congratulations! Thank you!
Hey, how'd the catering go? Oh, it was great!
The widow wouldn't pay, so Phoebe yelled at her 'til she did.
Yeah. I'm a hard ass.
And I'm a wuss.
And we should be partners.
Yeah. Hard Ass and Wuss. We could fight crime!
Wait a minute, Phoebe.
We should be partners.
We should be catering partners.
I mean, think about it! You're not working right now, and we have such a great time together!
Okay. I can cook and you can take care of the money.
Yeah. Oh! It'll be like I have a wife in the fifties!
Hey. Hey!
Hey, how'd it go? How'd she like the gift?
Oh, man, she loved it! She's over there showing Monica and Rachel right now.
Oh yeah? That's great!
Hey, listen, I gotta tell ya,
I feel kinda bad taking credit for this, because
man. am I gonna get a lot of credit for this!
Hey. Hey.
Hey. Happy birthday.
Thank you.
You know, uh... Chandler got you a gift, too.
No, he didn't.
Yeah, he did. Look, look, it's right there on the counter! Ha-ho-ho!
Happy birthday.
I'm sorry.
You really didn't have to.
See...You think it's just a pen, but you turn it over and it's also a clock.
Yeah. No, this is great.
Thank you, Chandler. Oh. Yeah.
Aw. Heh.
Wanna go to bed?
I'll be in in a minute.
Oh, uh... Don't forget your coupon.
Good night.
Um, thank you for the gift.
Oh, uh, I just knew that sometimes when you're writing...
you... you don't always know the exact time.
No, I... I didn't mean the pen. Thank you for the book.
Uh, the book?
The Velveteen Rabbit?
I kinda have the feeling you had something to do with it.
What do you mean?
Well, uh, when Joey gave it to me, he said,
"This is 'cause I know ya like Rabbits, and I know ya like cheese."
Thanks. I love it.
And I know how hard it must have been for you to find.
By the way, in case you missed that, that sound was, "Uhl, ell."
You must really like... Joey... to go to all that trouble for him.
Oh, yeah, he's my...
He's my best friend.
Well. Good night.
Hey, that coupon expires, you know.
Hi. Uh, you... you don't know me, I'm Monica Geller... Ross's sister.
Oh, yeah. Oh, you know, that's too bad that didn't work out.
Yeah. Anyway, he told me about your apartment.
And, um, I couldn't sleep, thinking about it.
So, uh, would it be okay if I cleaned it?
No?
I just walked in the bathroom and saw Kathy naked
It was like torture.
Y'know if we ever go to war and you're captured, you're in for a big surprise.
It just keeps getting worse and worse!
Y'know? I mean it's bad enough that I'm in love with my roommate's girlfriend
which by the way,I think she knows.
Because every time we're in the room together there's this weird like energy between us.
And call me crazy, but I think she likes me too.
And now I have seen her naked.
I mean at least when I've seen her with clothes on,
...I could imagine her body was like covered in boles or something.
But there are no boles. She's smooth.
Smooth!
Wow...
Could everyone totally see up his robe?
Oh, my God. Yeah.
Friends S04E07  The One Where Chandler Crosses a Line
Here you go.
Great. so I'll call you later.
Hey, hey. Who was that?
Casey. We're going out tonight.
Going out? huh? Wow! Wow!
So things didn't work out with Kathy, huh? Bummer.
No, things are fine with Kathy.
I'm having a late dinner with her tonight, right after my early dinner with Casey.
What? Yeah.
Yeah-yeah. And the craziest thing is that I just ate a whole pizza by myself!
Wait...  You're going out with Kathy.
Yeah. Why are you getting so upset
Well, I'm upset...
...for you.
I mean,having sex with an endless line of beautiful women must be very unfulfilling for you.
What's the big deal? It's not like we're exclusive.
Look, Joey.
Kathy is clearly not fulfilling your emotional needs.
But Casey...
I mean granted I only saw the back of her head,
But I got this sense that she's smart and funny...
...and gets you.
You got all that from the back of her head?
All right look, I think it's time for you to settle down.
Y'know? Make a choice, pick a lane.
Who's Elaine?
"Little, tiny Tarzan,
swinging on a nose hair. Swinging with the greatest of ease..."
Darn it! Now,I don't know who to get to the next verse.
Oh, you could just go uh,
"greatest of ease...
BAH-bah-bha-bhannn."
Then go right into it.
Yeah, ooh, I like that!
How do you know about "ba-ma-na-ma-na-ma"?
Well umm, y'know, I used to play.
Oh yeah, that's right, the keyboards, huh?
Yeah, just a little in high school, but then I really got into it in college.
I mean that's-that's when I really found my sound.
Oh God! Orange juice just came out of my nose, but it was totally worth it.
Oh, my God.
I completely forgot about your sound. Yeah.
He used to lock himself in the basement for hours.
No one was every allowed to hear, "The Sound."
I want to hear "The Sound."
Really? No. I mean, nah, I haven't played in so long,
and-and, well it's-it's really personal stuff, y'know?
Come on, play that funky music white boy.
Yeah, boy. No, you guys,
I mean my keyboards are all the way up in ... Oh Yeah, okay.
Okay, guys.
All right. Bring it on, you.
Here we go.
Y'know, I've-I've never played my stuff for anyone before,
so it's important that-that you understand
... it's about communicating...
...very private emotions.
Y'know, umm,
you should-you should think of umm, my work...
...as wordless sound poems.
That's what I'm.... Oh.my God! Play!
Boy, that was-that was, umm...
...terrific.
Really, bitchin'!
Wow, it was so -- wow!
Really?! I mean, really?!!
Yeah. I mean, you should play in public.
Wow, thanks, you guys. That's...ohhh,
I wanna, I wanna play you another piece!
Umm! Uh-oh!
I left my uh, helicopter sounds on another disk. I'll be right back! Okay?
This is so nice.  I'm -- I am so...
Oh God bless my dad sound proofing the basement!
I can't believe I ever let him touch me with those fingers.
What are you guys talking about? I loved it.
It was so moving.
Oh, plus it's just, it's so different from the stuff you usually hear.
You mean music?
Yeah, I know what you're thinkin'!
Yes, yes, your breasts are just as firm and juicy.
Come in.
Hey.
Oh, God. Is that Baywatch?
Uh yes, but uh, I just watch it for the articles.
So is Joey around?
No-no, he's not back yet, but he'll be here any minute.
So uh, come on in. Have a seat. Bow or stern?
I uh, don't really have a preference. You?
I like it in the stern.
Of the boat.
Hey, It's me. Listen Casey and I were on our way back and had a little car trouble.
What happened? We broke down on the Parkway,
so I have to walk back and get some transmission fluid.
And listen，you please tell Kathy that I'am sorry I'll be there as soon as I can.
Why can't you tell her? 'Cause I only have one quarter, and I think my time is about to--
Joey? Joey?
Yeah?
I thought your time ran out.
Me too, but I guess I do have a couple of more --
Uhh, that was Joey. He's running a little late, he says he's sorry.
So I guess it's just uh, you and me then.
Ok
Okay. Yeah, I think it is.
So what'd you do today?
Oh, I had an appointment to get my haircut...
Oh, it looks great! ...and then it got canceled.
Well, I could cut it.
Really?! You do that?
Yeah, I do. Of course, I learned at my aunt's dog grooming shop, but hey, what do you say?
Dog grooming huh?
Okay, just don't make my tail too poofy.
You have really great hair.
Well, thanks. I grow it myself.
Y'know who also has great hair is Joey!
Yes! Yeah! Joey has great hair!
Umm, I'm basically done here. Just let me get this off your neck.
What-what 'cha doin'?
Checking to see if it's even.
'Kay.
Looks good.
Oh the phone! The phone's making sounds.
Hello. Hey, dude, it's me.
Hey, it's Joey.
Listen uh, I'm really sorry, it looks like I'm gonna be stuck here for a while.
I got the transmission fluid, but when I went to put it in the car,
the transmission wasn't there!
What? Yeah, it must've fallen out a few blocks back.
I just figured we hit a dog.
Okay.
Listen uh, could you put Kathy on, I wanna apologize.
Oh yeah man.
Joey.
Hey...
No, it's fine. Don't worry about it.
Yeah-no, stop apologizing, it's okay.
Yeah! I'll talk to you tomorrow.
I should uh, probably go. Yeah.
Yeah. Yes! Yeah.
I forgot my purse.
Oh...
No, I really did forget my purse.No-no-no
No-no-no-no, this is bad! It's bad! This is bad!
Horrible!
Wait the uh, the kiss or the situation?
No-no-no, the kiss was good.
No, but that's bad! Ooh! Yes! Okay! Here's what we do,
we-we forget it happened. What?
Okay, we-we swallow our feelings.
Even if it means we're unhappy forever. Sound good?
Can you really do that?
I have to. He's my best friend.
And you're seeing him.
Chandler, I like Joey a lot.
But with you...
No, don't. Don't, see?
You're getting me confused. I'm starting to yearn.
I'm sorry.
If you want to pretend that nothing happened, I can try.
I think we have to.
Okay.
Bye. Bye.
Are you still out there?
No.
Electrifying
Emphatic time-time-time...
Y'know, there's a Starbucks about three blocks down.
It's so inspired! Look at him! Look at him go!
Thank you guys-guys-guys...
Hey, aren't you up next?
Oh no, I'm not playing tonight. Why not?
I can't follow Ross.
It'd be like those bicycle ridding chimps
that followed The Beetles. No....
Phoebe. Ross sucks.
Phoebe, the place has emptied because of him.
Oh my God, he's not even appreciated in his own time.
I'd give anything to not be appreciated in my own time.
Okay. Umm, Phoebe,
You suck too.
Yeah, Phoebe.
You're awful.
You guys.
You suck too.
Aww man! I can't believe I locked myself out again!
Hang on, buddy.
Oh my God! What happened here?
Did you do all this? I sure did.
Why? Well, I just thought it'd make me feel good to do something nice for my friend.
Well, you're amazing.
Oh no-no-no. This is amazing.
A TV as if it appears from nowhere!
That's the dream! Man,
how did you afford this stuff?
Well, y'know I'm 29. I mean who needs a savings account.
Oh, you are the best friends anyone has ever had.
Oh, I don't know.
Oh-no-no-no, you are!
You do this, you give me the great advice,
and hey listen, I was thinking about what you said yesterday about focusing on one woman,
I'm gonna do that.
You mean with Casey.
No-no-no, I think I'm gonna see how things go with Kathy. She's pretty cool.
Or Casey. No-no, Kathy.
Could be Casey.
No-no, Kathy.
Consider Casey.
Y'know what I think? I think somebody's got a little crush on Casey.
How 'bout I fix you two up? What do you think?
That all the pieces of my life are falling right into place.
Hey. Hey.
You were really great! You were really, really great!
Oh, thanks, thanks.
So Monica tells me that uh, you don't want to play anymore
because me....and y'know my talent.
Is that true?
Well, kind of, yeah. Pheebs...
Yeah, I-I can't --I mean y'know I was trying to be really y'know okay and upbeat about it...
...I just -- I feel so dwarfed by your musical gift. I...
See, but...
Pheebs that-that is the exact opposite intent of my music.
Y'know my music is-is meant to inspire,
If it bothers you this much...
...then I won't play anymore.
Oh no. No-no-no, don't do that!
How could I live with myself if I knew I was depriving the world of your music.
Yeah, okay.
Hey Chandler! Saw the new furniture. Very nice.
Yeah! Joey has the best boyfriend ever!
I kissed Kathy.
What? Are you serious?
Does Joey know? No.
Is there anyway, anyway you think he'll understand this?
You obviously haven't screwed over a lot of your friends.
Which we all appreciate.
No the-the sad thing is, if you had told him how you felt before you kissed her,...
...knowing Joey, he probably just would've just stepped aside.
Oh, don't say that! Don't say that. That's not true. Is it?
I think maybe, yeah. He loves you.
Then why didn't you tell me to do that?
Well, I said-I said something to Phoebe.
Yeah! No, that's right. And I thought it was a really good idea.
I know, I remember that! I remember you did.
God!! What am I gonna do?!
Well, Chandler, you're gonna have to tell him.
Why?! Why do I have to tell him?!
Because you do. Yeah, I know.
Hey, would it be okay if I wrote a song about this.
Hey. Hey.
Sambuca Margarita?
It that a real thing?
Well, we only had sambuca, so it is now.
Listen, Joe.
I-I need to, I need to talk to you about something.
What's up?
It's-it's about Kathy.
I like her.
I like her a lot, actually.
You do? Yeah.
Well, you're timing couldn't be better.
She's not my girlfriend anymore.
What?
Yeah, she broke up with me.
Oh uh, when?
Just now, after acting class.
At first I thought she was doing some kind of scene, that's why I let people watch.
Oh man, I am so sorry. Are, are you okay?
Well, I've been better. But, I'm all right. So you like her huh?
Yes, but I-I uh, don't have too.
No-no-no, no it's uh, it's okay.
Yeah? Yeah.
You know why? 'Cause you came to me first.
Well, I thought that would be the best thing to do.
But hey, listen just so you know, you might have you're work cut out for you.
'Cause when I talked to her, I kinda got the feeling that she's into some other guy. So...
See uh, that's-that's actually what I wanted to talk to you about.
I-I think I know who the other guy is.
Who?
It's me.
I'm the other guy.
What?
Yeah, I mean when you were late last night, Kathy and I got to talking, ...
...and one thing to another and...
And what? Did you sleep with her?
No! No! No! I just kissed her.
What? That's even worse.
How is that worse? I don't know! But it's the same!
Look, I'm sorry! But there's nothing I can do, I think I'm in love with her!
Who cares?
You went behind my back? I'd never do that to you.
You're right, I have no excuses! I was totally over the line.
Over the line?! You-you're-you're so far past the line,
that you-you can't even see the line!
The line is a dot to you!
Yes.
Yes! Right! And I feel horrible. You have to believe me!
Is that why you bought all this stuff!
Well, y'know what
I will not watch your TV.
I won't listen to your stereo.
and there's a cinnamon raisin loaf in the new bread maker that I'm not gonna eat! You know why?!
Probably because...
Because it's all tainted with your betrayal.
From now on this apartment is empty for me!
And I'm not happy about you either.
And just so you know...
...I made that bread for you.
Oh my God, he's lost it. He's totally lost it.
What?
Phoebe, his music could not get any worse.
There are rats in the basement that are hanging themselves.
Thank you. Thanks.
Yeah, I lost it.
Y'know, I'm not gonna play anymore, Would you...
Can you finish my set?
After that? Yeah!
No, I mean, if I can help.
Yeah, like I could lose it.
What? I played bad on purpose guys.
Okay, so you were trying to play bad this whole time.
Yeah. no, just that last song.
Hello?
Hey, It's me. I know you can't stand to be in the same room as me,
I just thought I'd try and apologize over the phone...All I...
Hello?
Look, I never should've kissed your girlfriend, but I'm...
Stop calling!
Hey! Hey! Hey! This is 92.3, WXRK, K-Rock...
...calling with our $1000 daily challenge.
All right.
What is the name of...
...your roommate who is very, very sorry and would do anything...?
Friends S04E08  The one with Chandler in a box
Ugh, turkey.
Ugh, giving thanks. Ugh.
Look, everyone, it's the spirit of Thanksgiving.
So are things with you and Joey any better?
They couldn't be worse. I spent eight hours calling him last night,
just trying to get him to talk to me.
Oh, wow. Eight hours.
So you could probably really use one of those plug-in telephone headsets, huh?
Should we all expect Christmas gifts that can be stolen from your office?
You shouldn't.
Speaking of Christmas...
since Monica and I are starting a new business and have like no money...
this year maybe we could do Secret Santa and then we each only buy one gift.
And-and there's the added mystery of, you know, who gets who.
Who gets "whom."
I don't know why I do that.
Oh, I'm gonna take a nap. Turkey makes me sleepy.
We haven't eaten yet.
I know, but all that work you're doing to get it ready, and I just...
Hey, by any chance did either of pick uh Rachel for your secret Santa, Because I wanna trade for her.
I picked her. Oh, thank God, you want her.Ooh!
Wow, why do you wanna get rid of her so badly?
Because she exchanges every gift she ever gets,
It's like impossible to get her something she likes.
Come on, let's trade.
That's not true. That's not true. I got her that backpack and she loved it.
I remember how much she was crying the day that big dog ran off with it…
There was no big dog.
All right this sucks, because I already got her this briefcase and I had "R.G." put on it.
Her initials. Oh.
Maybe you can give it to somebody else. Oh. Like Ross Geller.
Oh, you know what, though? It's a girlie briefcase.
Who cares? He works in a museum.
Hey, what time is it? The big game's about to start.
You don't have to do that, Ross and Joey aren't here. watch the parade if you want.
Thanks.
What is wrong with this freezer? Ow! Ow!
God, what happened? Oh, my God, ice just got in my eye.
People are trying to sleep in here.
Monica got ice in her eye and it hurts.
Open it up. Let me see. Oh, I can't. It really kills.
Well, maybe you should put some ice on it.
Ooh, it looks bad. Honey, Maybe we should take you to a doctor.
No, my eye doctor is Richard.
I can't go to him when I don't have a boyfriend.
He's really picky about his patients.
Okay, you've gotta go. What's his office number?
Oh, like I remember his office number.
Speed dial 7.
Hi, yeah, I'm calling on behalf of Monica Geller's eye, and...
Is Richard Burke in today?
He's out of town. but does she wanna see the on-call doctor?
Yes. Yes. She's very excited about that.
This is so cool.
Till Monica gets back, it's like I'm head chef and I get to make all the decisions.
Hey, hey, I thought she told you to follow the recipe exactly.
Okay, get out of my kitchen.
All right, okay. I think I'm making some progress with Joey.
When I went into the apartment, he went straight into his bedroom...
...but he only slammed the door once!
I mean, yeah, he gave me the finger while doing it.
All right I… I gotta call my mom and ask her a left-handed cooking question.
So listen, I picked Monica for Secret Santa...
...but I'm getting her something for Hanukkah.
I was wondering if you wanna switch.
Oh y'know what, I was already trying to trade for ah, well, you.
Really?! Wow! That's so nice, what are you gonna get me?
I don't know, R.G. I was thinking something girlie for your office.
Yeah. Well, maybe Phoebe will switch with me.
Oh no-no-no, you don't want to do that,Then you're gonna get stuck with Rachel, and she exchanges every gift she ever gets.
Oh, that's not true. I got her lots of stuff she never took back.
Like?
Like that gold necklace I got her last year.
When was the last time you saw her wear it?
Well, she wore it all Christmas day and then, uh...
Big dog?
Hey. Hey.
What are you doing?
Sending back all this stuff that Chandler bought out of guilt.
Everything? Even the TV? No, I'm put that in my room.
Listen, Joey. I know what he did was wrong.
But don't you think you could at least hear the guy out?
Back when you and Rachel were together...
...if Chandler had kissed her, would you hear him out?
That's a good point.
So uh, how long are you gonna punish him?
Five years.
You've sentenced him?
Hey, don't do the crime if you can't do the time.
But, Joey, the guy's your best friend. No, was my best friend.
Anyway, I don't know why you're pushing for him so hard.
With him out of the way as my best friend, there's a spot open.
Who, me? Yeah.
Wow. I'm honored.
And you know what I'm gonna do as my first act as your best friend?
I'm gonna get you to talk to Chandler.
All right.
Oh, but if you weren't my best friend...
Oh, my God. Is it really that bad?
I walk in the room, and he won't even talk to me.
He just mumbles something in Italian.
And I know he only knows the bad words.
Hey, Gunther, have you uh, have you seen Chandler?
I thought you were Chandler.
But, um, one of you is over there.
Hey, Joe.
I'll be right with you, okay?
Thanks
Oh, my God. How cute is the on-call doctor?
Oh. So cute that I'm thinking about jamming this pen in my eye.
Dr. Burke will see you now.
Oh, no, no, no, not Dr. Burke. Dr. Burke's out of town.
The on-call doctor will see me now.
Dr. Richard Burke is out of town.
Dr. Timothy Burke, his son, will see you now.
Ready?
Hey, I'm sorry. That...
Where you going? My folks'.
Oh, uh, when-when are you coming back?
I don't know.
I might stay there for a few days while I look for an apartment.
What?
Yeah, you know, at first I thought we could talk about this, work it out.
but uh, seeing you two together I don't think I…
Hey, look, what do you want me to say? Do you want me to say I'll stop seeing her?
Look, It's not about her. Okay?
But seeing you two together just reminds me of what you did.
And I don't wanna live with someone who doesn't know what it is to be a friend.
So I'll see you. Hey, look, I know what it is to be a friend.
I just-I just screwed up! Yeah, you did.
And that's why I'm leaving.
All right look, if you're not gonna stay for me, then at least stay for them.
Okay? They have had a very difficult year, what with the robbery and all.
When that guy was robbing us...
...and I was locked in the entertainment unit for six hours...
do you know what I was doing in there all that time?
I was thinking about how I let you down.
Wow. Yeah.
Yeah! But if would've know what kind of friend you were gonna turn out to be, I wouldn't have worried about it so much!
See you around.
Just wait one second. There has to be something that I can do.Something!
If we still had that entertainment unit...
...I would get in there for six hours and think about how I let you down.
What?
We got a box.
I remember the last time I saw you.
It was the morning I left for college.
And You were just standing outside the Dairy Queen.
Heh. Just probably waiting for it to open.
I gotta tell you, you look great now.
You look great too. You're an excellent patient.
So how does it look?
You've got a little scratch on your cornea. You're gonna have to wear a patch for a couple of days.
Like a pirate?
If that helps you.
Ahem. So how long have you been working with your dad?
Come on, one of us had to mention him.
I moved back here a couple months ago.
Oh. Big family dinner tonight?
No way.
I was gonna have Thanksgiving at my girlfriend's.
Oh. But we broke up.
She-she wasn't ready for a serious commitment.
Oh. So you made her walk the plank, aye, matey?
You're not wearing the patch yet.
I know.
He's coming here for Thanksgiving? I know. It's sick.
Why is it sick? Because it's Richard's son.
It's like inviting a Greek tragedy over for dinner.
Hey, come on, Phoebe, you understand, don't you?
Yeah, I can see where I'd be your best shot but, no.
I'm sorry, but I think it's twisted.
What's twisted? Oh. Me going out with Richard's son.
Ewwwww!!
Ew, ew, ew.
Sounds like a really bad idea to me.
Is he okay in there?
He's fine.
Hey, y'know, Mon, if things wrong out between you and Richard's son, ...
...you'll be able to tell your kids that you slept with their grandfather.
Fine! Judge all you want to but,
married a lesbian, left a man at the altar, fell in love with a gay ice dancer...
...threw a girl's wooden leg in the fire, live in a box.
So, now, ahem, what exactly is the point of the box?
Chandler?
The meaning of the box is three fold.
One, it gives me the time to think about what I did.
Two, it proves how much I care about my friendship with Joey.
And three
it hurts.
Oh, hey, hey, uh... Hmm?
you remember the necklace I gave you last year?
Can I see it?
Why?
I just wanna check something.
Okay.
Now we'll see.
Air hole! Air hole!
Here it is. I love it. I wear it all the time.
The necklace I got you was gold. this is silver.
Huh. Well, maybe, it, uh
it changed.
Oh, my God. You actually exchanged it.
Well isn't it better that I exchanged it for something that I enjoy
and that I can get a lot of use out of?
What did you get?
Credit.
I'll get it, I'll get it, I'll get it.
Hi, Tim. Hi.
Hi. Thank you. Come meet my friends.
This is Phoebe. Hi, nice to meet you.
And Joey. Hey.
Joey. My brother, Ross.
Hey. And Rachel.
Hi. Ahem.
That's Chandler. How do you do?
What's...? Um, well, he's, um...
He's doing some thinking.
He's got it.
Yes! Yeah!
What happened? What happened?! You kissed my girlfriend.
Ooh, I like those sunglasses.
"Like them" like them...
...or "I'd like to get store credit for that amount" like them?
All right, everybody. This turkey is ready.
Where can I wash up? Here.
Let me show you.
Okay, the towels are hanging next to the sink, and umm, you can use the fancy soap.
Thank you.
Fancy soap? I thought we were saving that for the Pope.
See? He's nice, right?
Yeah, but Monica, do you actually want to be in a relationship where you can actually use the phrase,
"That's not how your dad used to do it"?
Wow, everything looks great. Where should I sit?
Saved you a seat.
Sick-sick-sick-sick.
Oh, I'll get it.
Gotcha.
That doesn't sound like thinking to me.
Sorry. Y'know I don't think you should be talking at all in there!
I think you got too much thinking to do to be talking and making jokes.
Okay, okay, you got it.
Ross, could you pass me the yams? Sure.
Oh, and Joey's got the mashed potatoes if you want to exchange them.
Will you stop? What is the matter with you?
Oh-ho-ho, We've got company.
There's nothing the matter with me.
See, I'm not completely devoid of sentiment.
See, I have feelings.
Okay, fine.
You can't tell, but I'm trying to break the tension by mooning you guys.
All right, look.
If this is just a big joke to you, then forget about it, all right?
This means something to me.
And if it doesn't mean anything to you, then you should get out of there.
Otherwise, you're just an idiot in a box.
You're right. I'm sorry. This means a lot to me.
I want you to be my friend again. I swear I won't say another word tonight.
So you're gonna take this thing seriously? Absolutely.
That sounds like another word to me.
Are you gonna take this seriously?
Okay.
Don't say that I have no sentiment.
This is a movie stub from our first date.
This is an eggshell from the first time you made me breakfast in bed.
This is from the museum, the first time we...
...were together.
Okay, maybe I exchange gifts sometimes, but I keep the things that matter.
I don't know what to say. I'm sorry.
Though
you're not supposed to take these.
It's like a million years old.
we, we actually, we had people looking for that.
Oh, this always happens.
Here, let me, um...
Thank you.
You-you have a very beautiful
eye.
Y'know all my friends think this is weird.
Y'know I-I thought it was gonna be weird, I mean I almost called and canceled, but it really isn't.
I know. I mean, it's like me and your dad, that's a totally separate thing.
Oh, I totally agree.
we're just two people who find each other
very attractive.
Right?
What? Nothing, nothing.
No, no, really. Oh, was-was that not okay?
No, no, no, that was good.
That was, uh... That was a good kiss.
Oh, my God. It didn't remind you of my...? Oh, don't say it.
No, but it did! Didn't it?! Yes!
Oh, man.
I know.
I got it.
Hey. Hey.
Hey. Listen, I want you to know how sorry I am... It's okay.
That's okay. Chandler's the one I'm mad at. so...
Well, I'm so sorry.
Is he here? In the box.
Chandler?
Oh, he can't talk right now.
Why not? What's going on?
He's just trying to show Joey how much he means to him.
By being in a box? Joey had reasons.
They were threefold.
Oh. Well, uh...
you not being able to talk may make this easier.
Listen, um
Listen.
I don't wanna be someone who comes between two best friends.
I just... I can't stand seeing what this is doing to you guys.
And I don't wanna be the cause of that.So
I don't think we can see each other anymore.
I'm gonna go to my mom's in Chicago.
I'm gonna stay there for a while.
I think this could have been something really amazing.
But, you know, this is probably for the best.
You know?
I'm gonna miss you.
Goodbye, Chandler.
Open the box.
What? He can still catch her.
Hey, come on. Get out of there. Get out of there.
So...? Yeah, we're gonna be fine. Get out.
Yeah? Yeah.
Yeah, You did some real good thinking in there.
I mean, this is...
Now go. You could still catch her.
And merry Christmas from your Secret Santa.
All right, who got Chandler? Because I need to trade.
Oh, he sees her.
Aw, and he's catching up to her.
Oh, she sees him.
Oh, they're hugging. Aw.
He's taking her purse.
Uh, that's not them. I'm gonna go call the police.
Oh, there they are. Where?
All right, get a room.
Okay. Come on, no peeking.
Our eyes are closed, and we're about to cross the street. Very good.
Okay. Open up.
What did you want to show us? Because all I can see is this bitchen van.
Yeah, it's for our catering business.
Oh. I think I know that girl.
All right, umm, we're not gonna really keep it this way though. No?
We're gonna paint over the sword and replace it with a baguette.
Oh.
And also, we don't know what to do with this.
Oh, yeah, I definitely know her.
Friends S04E09  The one where they're gonna party
Remember that guy from cooking school I told you about that put cilantro with everything?
Oh, sure, Cilantro Larry.
Well, I'm gonna fill in for him as food critic for the Chelsea Reporter.
Wow. Monica, what an amazing opportunity to influence
...dozens of people.
How could you say yes, What about our catering business?
Oh, no, no, it's just one night a week.
and plus I get to take all of you out for a lot of free dinners.
Hey. Oh.
Oh, in that case—Yay!
That was me hopping onboard. Oh.
Hey, guys. Hey, Ross. Quick question for you.
Are you ready to party?
I don't know, I could maybe go out for a couple of beers.
But there's this thing about bumblebees on the Discovery Channel.
No, no, no, I don't think you heard me. Are you ready to party?
No.
Gandalf? Gandalf is coming to town?
Kathy's with her parents, I have nothing to do.
so tomorrow we are partying with Gandolf dude!
Dude, we are so gonna party. Yeah.
Wow, okay. Dude alert.
And who is this guy?
Mike "Gandalf" Ganderson. Only, like, the funnest guy in the world.
I'm gonna call and get off work tomorrow.
Oh. I'm gonna call after you.
This is gonna be so cool. Dude, we never party anymore.
Whoo! Whoo!
All right, were you guys smoking something in the back of our van?
Really. And what do you mean you never have fun anymore? You have fun with me.
Remember the time we saw those strippers and you paid me 50 bucks to eat that book?
Joey, you are gonna love this guy. Gandalf is like the party wizard.
Well, why do you call him Gandalf? Gandalf the wizard.
Hello? Didn't you read Lord of the Rings in high school?
No, I had sex in high school.
Oh. Uh, Joanna? I was wondering if I could ask you something.
There's an opening for an assistant buyer in Junior Miss
Okay, but that would actually be a big step down for me.
No, actually, I meant for me.
The hiring committee is meeting people all day and...
Oh. Well, I wish I could say no, but I guess you can't stay my assistant forever.
Neither can you, Sophie, but for different reasons.
God, I'm so glad you don't have a problem with this.
because if you did, I wouldn't even consider applying.
Really? Well, in that case
And that's why I'm so glad there's no problem.
That's fine, actually I'm on the hiring committee, so there'll be at least one friendly face.
Oh, that's great.
You know, Junior Miss is where I started.
I had to sleep with the ugliest guy to get that job.
Really? No. Ha, ha.
Yeah.
I mean, no. No, no, no. Ha, ha. No. Ha, ha.
don't you worry, I'm sure with your qualifications you won't need to sleep with some guy to get that job.
Although, uh, I might need some convincing.
Um... Oh. Kidding. Ha, ha.
God, I feel wild today. Aah!
Oh, man, I am so excited, I may vomit.
Will you calm down? He's just a human guy.
Look, you don't understand. Gandalf is amazing.
Y'know you're never know what's gonna end up happening,
You go out for a couple of beers and end up on a fishing boat to Nova Scotia.
Really? Oh, yeah, it's beautiful country up there.
Hey. Okay.
I got my passport, fresh socks, and a snakebite kit.
It's not gonna be exactly like last time.
All right, I'll see you guys.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
I have an audition, but I'll definitely hook up with you later.
Where you gonna be around noon? Heh.
Somewhere maybe along the equator?
Okay.
Hello?
It's Gandalf.
So are you in town?
Oh, well...
Well, maybe next time, then.
What happened?
He's not gonna make it. He's stuck in Chicago.
Oh, man.
Chicago, is sooo lucky!
Stupid, useless Canadian money.
You have a very impressive resume, Ms. Green.
I especially like what I see here about implementing a new filing system.
Thank you.
Filing system? Oh, you mean those-those little colored labels you put on all the folders?
It certainly did brighten up the inside of the filing cabinets.
Well, they, uh... they-they did more than that.
I notice that you've been entrusted with a lot of important responsibilities.
Yes. Joanna really has been an incredible mentor to me.
Oh. And Rachel has been really incredible at getting my morning bagel.
It's amazing how she gets it right almost every time.
I-I-I of course, I have more responsibilities than that.
Oh, yes, of course. There's the coffee too. Rachel can carry two things at once.
That's, uh, very good.
Now a uh, a big part of this job...
...is cultivating personal relationships, especially with designers.
Yes, Yes, I realize that... Rachel shouldn't have any problem with that.
Her only problem might be getting a little too friendly, if you know what I mean.
I love working with designers.
With them, under them, what's the difference, eh, Rach?
Hey. My first review is out. Oh! Oh, the Chelsea Reporter, ohh,
Ah. These used to keep me so warm.
All right, look at my on the back page. Ooh. Oh!
Okay. "Would I go back to Allesandro's? Sure, but I would have to order two meals.
One for me, and one for the guy pointing the gun to my head."
Wow, you really laid into this place.
Hey, they don't pay me a penny a word to make friends.
Ooh, I gotta go. I found a guy who could fix up the van for catering.
Oh. Do you need me to go with you? No, no, it's okay.
But are we sure we don't want the waterbed?
Haven't we made this decision? Yeah.
Bye. Bye.
Who is it?
It's Allesandro, from Allesandro's.
Oh, my God.
I wanna talk to you about your review. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Call me on the phone.
Why? So you could hang up on me?
But I'm never gonna let you up, so you may as well just go away.
Just give me a chance to...
Hey, Do you need to get in? Here you go.
No, Phoebe! Oh, hey, Monica.
I want a retraction. Our food is not "inedible swill."
I couldn't eat it.
I have five friends who couldn't eat it, and one of them eats books.
Well, our service is not "grossly incompetent."
The waiter carried the breadsticks in his pants.
Well, you said that we accept the Discover Card
which we do not.
All right, that I'll retract.
But I stand by my review. I know food, and that wasn't it.
Your marinara sauce tastes like tomato juice.
You should serve it with vodka and a piece of celery.
Hey, I'm proud of that sauce. It's delicious.
Oh, my God.
You own an Italian restaurant and you think that tastes good?
Where are you even from?
Lebanon.
Hand me those tomatoes.
I'm gonna show you what it should taste like. Come on.
How long is this gonna take? 'Cause I got another critic I gotta go yell at.
Ahem. Uh, Joanna, I wanna talk about that interview.
I thought it went very well.
No, it didn't. That's what I wanna talk to you about.
Now, just to brief you
I may cry.
But they are not tears of sadness or of anger
but just of me having this discussion with you.
Rachel, please, don't make a scene.
There's nobody here.
Sophie, get in here.
You see? Now you're making Sophie uncomfortable.
She's not making me uncomfortable.
Congratulations, You now just crossed the line into completely useless. Get out.
Do you want me to quit?
What? What would make you think that?
Well, all of those things you said in the interview.
I mean If you believe any of them, I must not be a very good assistant.
You know what?
I am just going to pack up my desk
and I will be gone by the end of the day.
Well, I guess there's no use me sticking around till the end of the day.
Wait, wait, wait.
You can put your sad little muffin back in its drawer.
If you must know the truth, I didn't wanna lose a perfectly good assistant.
What?
That's why I said all those things about your flirting and your drinking.
My drinking?
Oh. I must have said that after you left.
Said what, exactly?
That you enjoyed the occasional drink...
...ing binge.
Oh, my God. Oh. That is it. I'm leaving.
You are just a horrible person. No, wait, wait, wait.
Now, if you're gonna get all sensitive about it.
I don't want to lose you.
What if I create a position for you?
I'll make you assistant buyer in this department.
Say more things like that. Um...
You can have your own office and a raise, effective tomorrow.
I'd need an expense account. Done.
And an assistant. Sophie, get in here.
Hey, what are you guys doing here?
I thought you'd be partying with Gandoldorf.
It's Gandalf, and he's not coming.
So you've been sitting here all morning? No.
I balanced my checkbook.
Yeah, and I gave first names to all the foosball players.
I can't believe he didn't come.
So what if he didn't come? We can still go out and party ourselves.
Oh, no, you know, with Gandalf, we'd be out all night.
Yeah, we'd meet total strangers and hang out with them.
Well, we can do that.
There was other stuff too.
We'll do it all, and better.
Look, after tonight, Gandalf will wanna party with us, dude.
Come on.
Yeah. Yeah.
It's not like we don't know how to party. Yeah. All right. Let's go.
And may-maybe we could end up on a boat again?
Yeah! All right!
Ah!
Hey-hey-hey, when uh, when were we on a boat?
Remember that really cold morning
you woke up and those dogs were licking your face?
Yeah. those were seals, man.
Hey Mon, little question for ya! How do you think this suit will look on an assistant buyer?
Okay, the owner of Allesandro's came over to yell at me,
but instead I made him some sauce, and he offered me the job as head chef!!
Oh, my God.
You just ruined the thing I was practicing the whole way home, but I'm so happy.
Can you believe it? I finally get to run my own kitchen.
Oh, you've waited so long.
Hey. Hey, Pheebs. Quick question for you. yeah.
How do you think this suit would look on an assistant buyer at Bloomingdale's?
I don't know. It would totally depend on her coloring and...
You got the job! Yes!
Oh! You got the job? Why didn't you tell me?
Oh. It's gonna be so great. I'm gonna get to help decide what we sell.
I'm gonna have an office with walls and everything.
I'm gonna have walls. Aw.
Is this the day of good news or what? I got us a job.
The wedding reception.
Oh.
Um, Phoebe, I kind of need to talk to you about that.
well I-I-I think it might be time for me to take a step back from the catering.
But we've only had one job.
I know, but now we have this second one, and it just feels like it's snowballing.
Yeah, what are you saying?
I got offered the head-chef job at Allesandro's.
What? It's okay, 'cause y'know what? You don't really need me for the business.
You're the cook.
Without you, it's just me driving up to people's houses...
...with empty trays and asking for money.
All right.
But, um, well, I-I-I'll pay you back all the money you invested,
And you can keep the van. For what?
I can't believe this. I gotta get out of here.
Phoebe, wait a minute.
I'm an assistant buyer!
All right, we'll get a little coffee, get energized, then we'll head back out.
Yeah, all right. Okay.
So we're having fun, right? We don't need that wizard guy.
We hit a couple of clubs, talked to some strangers...
...then after this, we'll go down to the docks and see about that boat thing.
I'm kind of beat.
Actually...
...me too.
Are you serious?
Yeah.
Thank God. I'm exhausted.
So you guys want coffees?
Yeah, but I don't wanna be up too late, so I'll have a decaf.
Yeah, me too.
Actually, could I get some hot water with a little lemon?
I strained my voice screaming in there. Does it have to be so loud?
Oh. I can't hear a word you're saying, my ears are ringing so bad.
Huh. I was glad I brought that extra pair of socks, you know?
I used them as mittens.
I didn't wanna touch a thing in that last place.
How sad are we?
Yeah, I know.
You know what? We're not sad.
we're just not 21 anymore, you know?
I'm 29 years old, damn it.
I wanna sit in a comfortable chair, watch television...
...and go to sleep at a reasonable hour.
Yeah.
Yeah, and I like to hang out in a quiet place where I can talk to my friends.
Yeah.
And so what if I like to go home, throw on some Kenny G, and take a bath?
We're 29. We're not women.
Oh. There you are.
Hey, I'm glad that you decided to hear me out.
Okay, I'm hearing.
I've been doing a lot of thinking. A lot.
And, well, I came up with a whole bunch of businesses that you can do with your van.
Okay, um...
You could be a flower delivery person. What?
Or a bakery delivery person.
Pizza?
Monica.
All right, I got a whole bunch of stuff in this area...
...but I'm getting the feeling you don't wanna deliver.
No. Okay.
I'm guessing if you don't wanna deliver...
...you probably don't wanna pick up stuff either.
No.
You know what?
Let's do the catering business. Really? Are you sure?
Yeah. You know, I-I made a commitment to you.
Know what? Lt'd be fun. Oh, it will be fun.
Oh. Yay! Aw. Oh. Yay! Aw.
Okay. Ooh, let's plan the wedding reception. Okay.
Wow.
You really wanted me to do something with this van.
You know what? I want you to take the chefjob.
Really? Yeah.
That's what you really want.
Yeah, I don't wanna be the reason you're unhappy.
That would make me unhappy.
And I really don't wanna be the reason I'm unhappy.
Thank you.
Besides, it might be kind of fun to form the new A-Team.
Oh, hi, Mrs. Lynch. Is Joanna in already?
Oh, my goodness. You haven't heard.
Heard what?
Joanna passed away last night.
Oh, my God. How?
Well, she was leaving work, and she was hit by a cab.
Oh, my God. Oh, I cannot believe it.
I know. Oh, God.
Oh, God. Oh, God.
I didn't realize that you were so close.
Yes. So close.
Mrs. Lynch, I know that this is an emotional and difficult time for all of us.
But by any chance, did Joanna send any paperwork your way...
...before it happened?
No, nothing.
Imagine, if she'd just stepped off that curb a few seconds later...
Oh. Yes, yes, just a few seconds and she'd still be with us.
Nothing about an assistant buyer?
No, I'm sorry. I have to go.
Good morning.
Oh, Sophie, I guess you didn't hear about Joanna.
I sure did.
I'm so excited about having Monica come on board with us.
Although I do feel bad about having fired Chef Emilio.
It is like losing a member of the family.
Of course, that literally is the case for several of you.
Tony, Carlos, Marie...
...please tell your father how much we're going to miss him.
Now, I know that Monica has a lot of great ideas for this place.
Well, you all read the review. Ha, ha.
So without much further ado...
...I present to you our new head chef.
Um, I just wanna say, uh, that with a pinch of excitement...
...a dash of hard work, and a dollop of cooperation...
...we can have the recipe...
Are you going to kill me?
Hey. Hey.
Sorry I'm late. Did I miss anything?
Joey stuffing fifteen Oreos in his mouth.
Fifteen?
Your personal best! Ha, ha.
So Where were you?
On a date.
I met this girl on a train going to a museum upstate.
Oh, Which museum? Oh, yeah! How'd you meet her?
No. Answer his.
Okay, it was just me and her at the back of the train,
and I sat near the door so she'd have to pass by me
...if she wanted to switch cars. She was totally at my mercy.
Were you so late because you were burring this woman?
No, I'm getting back down 'cause she lives in Poughkeepsie.
She seems really great, but she lives two and a half hours away.
How can she be great if she's from Poughkeepsie? Ha-ha-ha.
That joke would have killed in Albany.
Done! I did it!
Heh, Who's stupid now?
Friends S04E10  The one with the girl from Poughkeepsie
Hey, look at this! They're lighting the big Christmas tree tonight.
Um, that paper is two weeks old.
All right, Who keeps leaving old newspapers in the trash?
I really wanted to take Kathy to this. I can't believe I missed it.
Hey, y'know, at least you have somebody to miss that stuff with!
I hate being alone this time of year.
Next thing it'll be Valentine's Day...
...then my birthday, then bang!
before you know it, they're lighting that damn tree again.
Ohh, I want somebody!
You know, I want a man!
I mean, it doesn't even have to be a big relationship. y'know, just like a fling would be great.
Really?! I didn’t think girls ever just wanted a fling.
Let me tell you, it's been a long time since I've been flung.
Well, I know what I'm giving you for Christmas.
There are nice guys in my office. Want me to set you up?
Yeah.
Yeah! Wait a minute, it's been a long time that I've been single. How come you never offered this before?
Well, I have a girlfriend, I'm-I'm happy.
So, I no longer feel the need to go out of my way to stop others from being happy.
Okay.
No accountants.
And no one from "legal." I don't like boring jobs.
Oh and Ross was like what? A lion tamer?
What's wrong, Mon?
Ohh, everybody at the restaurant still hates me.
I thought I was making headway.
Everyone was smiling at me all day, and then I get off work
and find out that they wrote this on my chef's hat.
Hey, maybe they meant to write, "Quiet, Bitch."
Hey, honey! What's the matter?
Fine! Just trying to be nice.
I haven't been picked on this much since kindergarten.
And they brought in someone from junior high to do the see-saw with me.
I mean they're trying to do everything they can to make me quit,
and if there were any other job, I would.
This is something I've been waiting for my whole life.
Well, wait a minute, you're the boss.
Why don't you just yell at them? Or, fire them?
I would love to, but I can't. you know that I'm not good at confrontation.
Hey, You know what you can do?
I remember read about this director, I think it was Orson Wells,
who at the beginning of the movie would hire somebody,
just so he could fire them in front of everybody.
Then they would all know who was boss.
Hey, Mon! I'm not doing anything, why don't you fire me?
I's a good idea! do you know waiter?
Good enough to get fired.
All right. You're hired!
Hey!
Hey! That must be why I got fired last week! Does this Orson Wells guy direct Burger King commercials?
Yes.
I say, Drew? Are you seeing anybody right now?
Og-ee-op, I'm not asking for me.
I’m… I mean… No, I'm-I'm not gay, I'm not asking you out.
I'm not gay. Okey!
I didn't think you were gay.
I do now.
See my friend-my friend, Rachel, she wants to be set up.
Ahh,I just got out of a big relationship.
I'm not looking for any thing serious.
Oh, y'know what, that might be okay even if it was just kind of a fling, that might be all right with Rachel.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Is this "Hot Rachel" that you took to the Christmas Party? Rachel?
Oh, By the way, that is her full name.
Wow! I'm free for her.
Oh, wait a second! I didn't say I wasn't free.
Hey, Chandler, I'll talk so at the Ranger game tomorrow?
Hold on. y'know I just got a box of Cubans.
maybe I bring them by your office around uh, five?
that's uh, a little later than I uh, generally care to stay, but sure!
Maybe, before the game
we can enjoy some eight year old some small batch Basel Hadens.
Well, I don't really know what that is, but let's!
Hey! You guys, I'm writing a holiday song for everyone. Do you want to hear it?
Yeah! Yes!
Happy Hanukkah, Monica
May your Christmas be snowy, Joey
Happy New Year, Chandler and Ross
Spin the dreidel, Rachel
Pheebs, that's great! Oh, yay!
But you know, uh, Rachel doesn't rhyme with dreidel.
I know, but it's so hard. Nothing rhymes with your stupid name!
What are you talking about? Lots of things rhyme with Rachel:
Bagel, mail, jail, bail, cable.
Maypole.
All good. Thanks.
Do you maybe have a nickname that's easier to rhyme?
Didn't your dad call you "Pumpkin"?
Oh, yeah.
Pumpkin? Yeah. But did he ever call you "Budolph"?
Hello, children. Hey.
Have I got the 50 guys for you!
Really? Oh yeah, I just showed this a picture of you and
guys were throwing themselves at me!
They're buying me drinks! They're giving me stuff!
Knicks tonight? Sure! Where are the seats?
Wherever! I've got 20.
So, will I like any of these guys?
You know, I'm going to, uh...
...play the field a little bit more. Chandler...
Guys are signing over their 401 Ks to me.
You work with robots?
Yes.
Yes. Okay, there's this one guy, Patrick, I think you're gonna like him,
He's really nice, funny and a swimmer.
I like swimmers' bodies.
Yes, and his father invented that magnetic strip on the back of credit cards.
Op, I like credit cards!
See, I'm not bad at this fixing up thing, huh?
Well, so what does he do? Oh, he works in the Fine Foods division.
You have a fine foods division? It's a big company,I don't—if you—I…
Now, wait a second. You make food and robots?
No, the robots just work for them.
All right, I'm going to work.
Does anybody have a problem with that?
Yeah, lady. I do!
I got a problem with that!
You want a problem? I'll give you a problem!
Oh, what are you gonna do? You're gonna fire me?
You bet your ass I'll fire you!
See you later. Thank you.
Oh, wow! I should get going. I-I got a date tonight.
Oh yeah! With who?
You know that girl I told you about who lives up in Poughkeepsie? Yeah.
Not her.
Yeah, this is someone else,
and I-I can’t decide between the two of them.
The one from Poughkeepsie, even though she's a two hour train ride away, is really pretty...
...really smart and a lot of fun.
But this other girl, well，she lives right uptown.
Y'know she's, well she's-she's just as pretty,
I guess she's smart.
She's not fun.
she's no fun, why date her at all?
Well, I-I want to give her a chance. y'know? She lives so close.
And, at the end of the date, the other time, she-she said something that...
if she was kidding, was very funny.
On the other hand, if she wasn't kidding, she's not fun. She's stupid and kind of a racist.
Hey. Hey. Hey, man!
Hey! Ooh, How was your first day working at the restaurant?
Damn!
Hey. Hey.
What happened to your fancy chef's jacket?
They baked it.
I can't take this anymore.
I'm gonna call a meeting tonight, I'm gonna fire you tonight.You got it. Oh, oh!
What are you doing?
It's still a tiny bit on fire there.
Thanks. I think you got it!
Chandler, you have the best taste in men.
Well, Like father, like son.
Patrick and I had such a great time last night!
I mean I think this could maybe turn into something serious.
Really?! I-I thought you weren't looking for something serious? I thought you were looking for some kind of a fling.
Well, you know, possibly.
You didn't tell him that, though, right?
Ummmmmmmm, no.
You told this guy that I was looking for a fling?
You don't tell the guy that!
Why not?I'd be thrilled if I heard that some hot girl was just looking to get
I see.
Oh, between you telling him that I wanted to have a fling
and me putting out on the first date
oh, he's so gonna get the wrong idea.
Hey, Joey, could you pass the cheese?
Yeah. Listen uh, I'd prefer you didn't call me Joey.
Since I don't know anyone here, I thought it'd be cool to try out a cool work nickname.
Hey, Dragon!
Here's your tips from Monday and Tuesday.
There's like-there's like 300 bucks in this one!
Yeah, People get generous around the holidays.
And it never hurts to wear tight trousers.
Okay. Could the waiters gather around to hear tonight's specials?
Okay, first there's Chilean sea bass with a mango relish on a bag
Why is nobody writing these down?
We can remember them.
Because you'll make up fake specials and make me cook them like you did the other night?
Well, Sure, that too.
Okay, Forget the specials for a minute. Umm, all right here's the thing...
For the last two weeks I have, uh...
...tried hard to create a positive atmosphere.
Can't hear you!
positive atmosphere!
But I've had it up to here.
From now on, it is going to be my way
...or the highway. All right?
Does anybody have a problem with that?
Hey, new guy.
I said, does anybody have a problem with that?
No, ma'am.
Hey! He has a name. It's Dragon.
You want to know your name? Check your hat.
We did the hat, right?
What the hell just happened? I am so-so-so sorry.
I was going to do it.Really!
But I was standing there with $327 in one hand...
...and $238 in the other. And I was thinking...
"Wow! It's been a long time since I had…
...327 plus $238!
Joey, We had a deal! That-that's why you're here. I've got to fire you!
And I got to pay rent!
how-how about this? You don't fire me,
instead I stay here, I gain their trust.
and they'll start listening to all the nice things I've been saying about you.
What nice things?
Well Nothing yet. they really hate you and I want to fit in.
Happy Hanukkah, Chandler and Monica, Merry, merry...
Oh, y'know, y'know what Pheebs?
I'm not Jewish so...
So! Ross doesn't really decorate his tree with floss,
but you don't hear him complaining do you? God!
Bad dream?
I wasn't sleeping.
Oh yeah, then uh, what was Phoebe's song about?
The one with the cat.
I got to go. I've got another date.
So, did you pick one yet?
No, it turns out the one from uptown was making a joke.
But it was a different joke than I thought—it wasn't that funny.
So I'm still torn.
Well look, you don't really like the one from uptown
and you're too exhausted from dating the one up in Poughkeepsie,
so I say you just end them both. Okay?
You take a train up to Poughkeepsie and break up with her,
and on your way back you break up with uptown.
And then by the time you get home tonight, you're done!
Y'know, You're right. Thank you.
Umm, well I had a similar problem when I lived in Prague.
Prague? So much you don't know.
Chandler?
Patrick just, uh, ended things with me.
Did you or did you not tell him that I was looking for a serious relationship?
I did! I absolutely did!
You idiot!
I'm sure you're right. But why?
You don't tell a guy that you're looking for a serious relationship! You don't tell the guy that!
Now you scared him away!
Oh, man. I'm sorry, I'm so-so sorry.
Y'know, You should never be allowed to talk to people!
I know, I know!
Oh! See just I'm now right back where I started!
Aww, this sucks!
Being alone sucks!
Well, y'know, you're-you're gonna meet somebody!
You're a great catch!
Y'know when I was telling all those guys about you, I didn't have to lie once.
Really? Yeah.
You graduated magna cum laude, right?
No.
Oh, it doesn't matter.
Hey, y'know what, I've got two tickets to tonight's Rangers game, you wanna come with me?
Cute guys in little shorts?
Sure.
Actually, it's a hockey team.
so it's angry Canadians with no teeth.
Well that sounds fun too. Thank you.
Have you ever been with a woman?
What?
Chandler, what is the matter with you?!
So there is no good time to ask that question.
The station is Poughkeepsie. Poughkeepsie!
Ross?
Ross?
Wake up!
Ross? Ross! Ross!
I need more swordfish.
Can you get me more swordfish? I don't speak English.
You did a minute ago!
well, I don't know what to tell you.
Fine.
Okay! Very funny!
Somebody let me out please?!
Come on, I'm cold!
And covered in marinara sauce!
Come on! Let me out!
You found that handle, did you?
It's not funny. Well, that's not true.
I'm a good person. And I'm a good chef.
and I don't deserve to have marinara sauce all over me!
If you want me to quit this bad then you all have...
Hey. Chef Geller?
Y'know that little speech you made the other day?
I got a problem with it!
You do? You bet I do!
I just, uh, wasn't listening then, that's all.
Well if you want a problem, I'll give you a problem!
What are you going to do? Fire me?
You bet I'll fire you! Get out of my kitchen!
Get out!
All right.

No, it's really good.
Good! Now, Take those salads to table four.

Now that I see them, I win!
What?
We're at my stop. But would you like to have coffee?
Are we really in Montreal?
Yes, we are.
So coffee?
Coffee sounds great.
Wait, so,
So you live in Montreal?
Oh, no. But it's a two hour ferry ride to Nova Scotia.
Well I guess I should've thought about my wife and kids...
...before I talked back to Chef Geller.
Thanks.
Yep! Looks like it's gonna be a leeeeean Christmas at the Dragon house this year.
Enough!
Lean, lean, lean!
Went to the store Sat on Santa's lap

Monica, Monica

He said hello to Ross
And please tell Joey
Christmas will be snowy
And Rachel and Chandler, have err-umm-glander!!
Happy holidays, everybody!
Oh my God! I can’t believe my little brother is married!
You guys, why didn’t you tell me you were eloping?
'Cause it just sorta happened, y'know we were at the courthouse, we were having lunch…
Wait, wait, why were you at the courthouse?
We were having lunch.
Yeah and then all of the sudden we were like,
"Hey! Y'know, we’re here, having lunch let’s get married! right!
Wow, a year and a half ago I didn’t even know I had a brother, and now I have a sister too.
Oh, it's so great.
Okay. Okay.
Stop it, don't. So,
I'll get you a gift now.
Is there anything you need?
Uh, yeah.
We've been trying to get pregnant. uh pretty much ever since we got engaged, we'd get a jump on things,
y'know no one's getting any younger. Ha-ha-ha.
Because the thing is, um, we're not able to, you know, uh, conceive.
And we've tried everything, we've seen a bunch of doctors.
Yeah, and they-and they say that our-that our only chance to have a baby ...
...is that if they take my sperm, her egg, and put it together in a dish...
...and put it into another girl.
So we were wondering if you could be that girl that we could put it into.
That's a really nice gift.
I was thinking of a gravy boat.
The One With Phoebe’s Uterus
Hey! You guys! Check it out, check it out! Guess what job I just got.
I don't know, but Donald Trump wants his blue blazer black.
What?
Blue blazer back. He wants it back.
You said "black." Why would he want his blue blazer black?
Well, you know what I meant.
No,You messed it up.
You're stupid.
So what job did you get Joe?
Oh, ah, tour guide at the museum. Yeah, Ross got it for me.
Well, how can you be a tour guide, don't you have to be a dinosaur expert or something?
No, not really. They give you all the information.
it's uh, it's like memorizing a script.
"And on your left, you have Tyrannosaurus Rex, a carnivore from the Jurassic period.
Very nice.
Yeah, actually, Joey, it's the Cretaceous Period.
Yeah but, I can pronounce Jurassic.
Hey!
Guess what. Frank Jr., and Alice got married!
Oh, my God!
And! And, they’re gonna have a baby!
And! And, they want me to grow it for them in my uterus.
My God! Are you serious?
Yeah.
You're thinking of having sex with your brother?
Ewww! And "Oh no!"
It's—they just want me to be the surrogate.
It's her-it's her egg and her sperm, and I'm-I'm just the oven, it's totally their bun.
What did you tell them?
Well, they said that I had to think about it first, but what is there to think about?
I'm gonna be giving them the greatest gift you can possibly give.
You'll carry their child, and get them a Sony PlayStation?
Honey, this really is an incredible thing to do for them,
But there are things to think about.
Yeah, you'd be pregnant. I mean pregnant.
I know.
Pheebs, you're talking about putting your body through an awful lot,
I mean morning sickness, uhh, labour,
and it's all for somebody else!
Yeah. What's your point?
Well, the stuff I just mentioned.
Wow! I don't know if I could ever do that.
Y'know I always figured the first time I had a baby was with somebody I love
and that baby would be a
...a keeper.
Y'know you guys were a lot more supportive when I wanted to make denim furniture.
No, Pheebs, listen, if you decide to do this, we'll be supportive like crazy.
We just want you to think it through.
Yeah, honey, maybe you can talk to somebody who's had a baby. Like your mom.
My mom never gave birth. Oh! But my birth mom did!
I love this tushy! Can I take it to work with me?
Oh, yeah, sure. It's not mine anyway. It came with the pants.
I am so jealous.
You guys are really right…there aren’t you?
Yes.
Right where?
In the beginning where it's all sex and talking...
...and sex and talking.and…
Yeah, you-you gotta love the talking.
And the sex?
All right, we haven’t had sex yet.
Okay, What's the big deal? Y'know? This is special,
and I want our love to grow before we move on to the next level.
Oh, Chandler, that is so nice.
That is really nice...
...lying!
No way is that the reason. Why?
Just because you're not mature enough to understand something like that?!
No, he's right, I'm totally lying.
Then what is it?
Well, Kathy's last boyfriend was Joey.
And you're afraid you won't be able to fill his shoes?
No, I'm afraid I won't make love as well as him.
Yeah, I was going for the metaphor.
Yes, and I was saying the actual words.
So big deal, so Joey's had a lot of girlfriends, it doesn't mean he's great in bed.
We share a wall.
So either he's great in bed, or she just likes to agree with him a lot.
Sweetie, with you it's gonna be different.The sex is gonna be great, 'cause you-you guys are in love.
Yeah? Yeah.
Just go for it Chandler.
Yeah, you should, really.
All right. all right, I'll sleep with my girlfriend.
But I'm just doing it for you guys.
Okay, now the Mastodon is from the semi-late Jurassic period.
Isn't the mastodon from the Pliocene Epoch?
Shh.This is a museum, no talking.
Right down here we have...
...a large foot.
And over here we have Ross Geller.
Everyone wave "hi" to Ross.
Ross is one of our most important scientists, look at him, hard at work.
Okay, moving right along.
Come on.
It's open! Come in!
I'm sorry I'm late. That's okay.
it gave me time to finish glazing my nipples.
Wow! You really go all out when you're expecting company.
No, I was working on my pottery.
Oh! Oh!
Oh! I didn't know that you did pot.
Well, yeah, Mostly nudes. It combines my two passions: Pottery and erotica.
Ooh, erotiery!
Hey! Okay!
Well thanks for coming out to see me. I just
I just thought it would be a very good idea to talk about this baby stuff in person.Okay.
I really don't think it's a very good idea, Phoebe.
Why not?
Well, because you'd be giving up a baby,
And I really don't...
I don't know if there's anything I can say...
...that could make you understand the pain of giving up a baby.
So...
No, no, I understand the pain. Don't-don't hurt the puppy.
No, no. The puppy is yours.
Oh, I get a puppy!
Well, yeah! I mean yeah, but only for three days.
Why?
Y'know. I realise I don't have any right to start get all parenty on you and everything now,
uhh… Phoebe, would you please look at me and not the puppy, it's very important.
Okay.
I mean, I know what I'm talking about.
I gave up two babies.
and I only wish I had someone there that had given up babies, that could tell me...
...how terrible it is to give up babies.
I just think that, it would be something you will regret every single day for the rest of your life.
So however hard it is for you to give up this puppy...
...it would be a million times harder to give up a child.
I really shouldn't have given you the puppy first.
Uhh, do you mind sitting there. I'm saving this seat for my friend Ross.
You mean Dr. Geller?
Doctor? Wow! I didn't know he had a nickname.
Oh, he won't sit here.
Only the people in the white coats sit over there,
and only the people in the blue blazers sit here.
Well, how-how come?
That's just the way it is.
That's crazy.
Maybe it's crazy in a perfect world: A world without lab coats and blazers.
But you not in a perfect world. You in a museum now.
See that scientist in the classes,
he and I used to play together all the time in grade school, but now…
Peter! Hey, Peter!
It's me, Rhonda from P.S. 129?
I shared my pudding with you, man!
I gave you my snack pack!
See? He pretend he don't even hear me!
I-I think everybody's pretending they don't hear you.
Anyway, look, I don't know about you and your jackets and your separate tables, ...
...but Ross is one of my best friends,
and if I save him a seat, I'm telling you, he will sit in it!
Ross. Ross.
Over here, man! I-I saved you seat.
That's okay, I'm cool over here. I'll catch up with you later, Joey.
Op, this is saved.
Gift shop.
Hey, uh, I'm really, really sorry about what happened in the cafeteria today.
It's no big deal. Hey, y'know, you do what you gotta do. Right?
But hey, it's not just me, I mean the scientists and the tour guides never sit together.
Whatever.
It's like that everywhere, Joey! Okay, Mon, back me up here.
Where you work the uh, waiters eat with the waiters, right?
And the chefs eat with the other chefs, right?
I eat by myself in the alley, because everybody hates me.
Look, Ross.
really it's-it's no big deal.
Y'know you wear a white coat, I wear a blue blazer,
If that means we can't be friends at work, then so be it.Y'know,
hey I understand. Y'know?
Hey, when I'm in a play and you're in the audience, I don't talk to you, right?
So it's, you know, it's, uh, cool.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Yeah, when we're in the audience he doesn't talk to us, but he does wave.
Hi.
Why's Phoebe singing to Karl Malden?
Ooh, y'know what, I think it's time for puppy to go out again.
Come on, let's go to the balcony. What?
Umm, the street. Come on, let's go to the street.
Ooh, listen, don't go onto the balcony until after I get back.
So did you do it?
Yes, yes, we had the sex.
Uh-oh. It was bad?
It was fine, y'know? But she didn't agree with me as strongly as she agreed with Joey.
She was more like, "I see you point, I'm all right with it."
Well, it was the first time. Y'know, there's not always a lot of agreement the first time.
Yeah. Not for girls, anyway. Guys agree like that.
Look, you have to help me. Okay?
I mean...
I know what to do with a woman, y'know, I know where everything goes, it's always nice.
But I need to know ...
...what makes it go from nice to...
..."My God! Somebody's killing her in there!"
All right, I'm gonna show you something a lot of guys don't know.
Rach, give me that pad, please?
All right.
Now.
Look, You don't have to draw an actual... Whoa, she's hot!
Now everybody knows the basic erogenous zones.
You got one, two, three...
...four...
...five, six and seven.
There are seven?
Let me see that.
Oh, yeah.
That's one?
It's kind of an important one!
Oh, y'know-y'know what, I was looking at it upside down.
Well, y'know, sometimes that helps.
Now, most guys will hit uh, 1-2-3 and then go to 7 and set up camp.
That's bad?
Well if you go to Disneyland, you don't spend the whole day on the Materhorn.
Well you might if it were anything like 7!
All right uh, the important thing is to take your time,
You want to hit them all...
... and you mix them up. You gotta keep them on their toes.
Oh, toes!
For some people.
All right.
You could, uh, start out with a little one.
A two.
A one, two, three.
A three.
A five.
A four.
A three, two.
Two. A two, four, six.
Two. Four, seven!
Five, seven! Six, seven!
Dr. Geller, there's a seat over here.
Thank you, Dr. Phillips.
But I'm having my lunch...
...at this table. Here in the middle.
I'm having lunch right here,
...with my good friend Joey,
If he'll sit with me.
I will sit with you, Dr. Geller.
You know...
...we work in a museum of natural history.
And yet, there is something...
...unnatural...
...about the way we eat lunch.
Now, I look around this cafeteria, and y'know what I see, I see-I see division.
Division between people in white coats and people in blue blazers.
and I ask myself,  "My God, why?"
Now, I say we shed these-these coats...
...that separate us.
And we get to know the people underneath.
I'm Ross!
I'm divorced and I have a kid!
I'm Joey! I'm an actor!
I don't know squat about dinosaurs!
I'm Ted, and I just moved here a month ago, and New York really scares me.
All right, there you go! Yeah, you hang in there Teddy!
I'm Andrew.
And I didn't pay for this pear.
Okay. good-good for you.
I'm Rhonda! And these aren't real!
Wow, Rhonda.
I'm Scott. Yeah, okay, Scott!
And I need to flip the light switch on and off 17 times before I leave a room...
...or my family will die.
My mom's gonna be here any minute.
I can't do this, I can't give him up.
Yes, no. I can.
I don't want to.
But I can.
No.
Oo, I can't watch this, It's like Sophie's Choice.
You know, I never saw that.
Oh, it was only okay.
I can't do this.
My mom was right. If I can't-if I can't give him up,...
...then there's no way I can give up a baby.
Ohh, God, Frank and Alice are gonna be so crushed.
What-what else, what else can I give 'em—a kidney!
Uhh, we were just in the neighbourhood, so…
Yeah, so we just thought we'd stop by and let you know there's still no pressure.
None.
But if there was something you wanted to tell us, we're just gonna be right over there having coffee.
Okay.
Oh, who's this little guy?!
He's so cute! He reminds me of my old dog, Tumor.
You are so precious, I could just take you home.
Hey, why don't you?
Are you serious?
Uh-huh. Yeah.
Oh, thanks.
What are you doing? No, I'm really okay with this.
You know why? Because look at them.
Look how happy they are.
And I made that, so... Y'know
it's gonna be like a million times harder to give up a baby but, oh my God,
it's gonna feel like a million times better, right?
I wanna do this.I wanna carry your baby.
Thank you so much!
You don't know what this means to us.
Oh my God, I think I'm gonna cry!
It's going to be so great.
Hi.
What's going on? Oh, I-I gave them the puppy
and it made them so happy that I decided I’m gonna carry their baby.
But Phoebe... No-no-no, I know,
but you and I are different people though,
and this is a totally different situation,
and I know that I am not gonna regret this
Oh, I-I-I understand all that,
but it's just—that was my puppy.
Would you ever be a surrogate for anyone?
It depends on who asked.
What if I asked?
Oh, Mon, sure!
Really? Yes.
You’re not asking are you? No.
Yes. Totally.
Thank you! Thank you!
Thank you!
Yes, thank you!
What the hell is that?
What the hell is that? Is that you?
Boy, you're really not a morning person. Just back off!
Get up! Get up! Get up!
What is that noise?
You.
It's the chick.
She's going through some changes.
What kind of changes?
Well, the vet seems to think that she's becoming a rooster.
We're getting a second opinion.
Friends S04E12  The One With The Embryos
Hey, what are you doing shopping at 8 in the morning?
Well, I've been up since 6...
...thanks to somebody's dumb-ass rooster.
You guys, you really should get rid of those animals.
They shouldn't be in an apartment.
Yeah! Especially not with all of these knives and cookbooks around
All right, I'm gonna go to the fertility doctor and, uh, see if I'm ready...
...to have Frank and Alice's embryo transferred into my uterus.
Now, how will they know if you're ready?
Oh, they're just gonna look and see if my endometrial layer is thick.
Oh, I can check that for you.
Okay, everyone, think "thick."
Good-bye! Good luck.
Hey. Wish me luck. Hey.
Oh, good luck. Good luck.
And I'm still right. so not true.
What?
She's mad because I know today's her laundry day...
...and that means she's wearing her old-lady underpants.
I can check that for you.
I just can't believe that you think that you and Chandler know me and Rachel...
...better than we know you.
Well, we do.
You can only eat Tic Tacs in even numbers.
Yeah, what's that about?
And you. Ross, I believe if you check Rachel's bag...
...you will find a half-eaten box of cookies in there.
You're good.
These are not.
I'm so not impressed. Everybody snacks when they shop.
Yeah. Oh, yeah?
Ross, how many items left in that bag?
Five. Okay.
Ten bucks says that we can name every item in that bag.
How many guesses do you get? Six.
Challenge extended.
Deal. Challenge accepted.
All right, we'll start with......apples.
We'll be starting with apples.
Stop that now.
Yes.
Okay. Uh, tortilla chips.
Yogurt. Diet soda.
Yes, yes, yes.
Orange juice. No, there's no orange juice in there.
We win. Ha, ha.
They have another guess.
Okay, well, we won that one.
Okay. The last thing is...
Ooh, ooh, ooh.
No, no. Not for, like, another two weeks.
I got it. Scotch...
...tape.
How did you know she would buy Scotch tape?
Well, we used up theirs last night making scary faces.
Oh, man.
All right. Ten bucks. Fork it over.
Cough it up. Pay the piper.
Give me it.
That does not mean you know us better. I want a rematch.
Yeah, and none of these stupid grocery questions. Real personal questions.
Yeah. And the winner gets 100 bucks.
Serious?
Are you scared?
No.
Okay, who makes up the questions?
Ross will do it.
Oh, sure, Ross will do it.
It's not like he has a job or a child or a life of his own.
Well, fine. We'll ask Phoebe.
No, no, no, I wanna play.
Looks like your uterus is ready for implantation.
Oh, I knew it. I knew it. I felt really thick this morning.
Ha, ha. Okay, so, what's now? Go get the eggs. Put them in there.
Okay. It'll take just a little while to prepare the embryos.
Embryos? As in more than one? Mm-hm. Five, actually.
Five? Okay, where am I giving birth
in a hospital or a big box under the stairs?
Ha, ha. We do five because that gives you a 25-percent chance...that at least one will attach.
That's it? Twenty-five percent?
That means that it's, like, 75-percent chance of no baby at all?
Yeah, you know, I was thinking, what are the odds
if, like, you stuff, like, 200 of them in there?
Sweetie, now...
she's a woman, not a gumball machine.
Okay, well, you know what? Don't worry.
I'm gonna do this as many times as it takes to get it right.
Well, see, the thing is, we kind of only have one shot.
Um, it costs $16,000 each time you do this.
So, um, we're kind of using all the money we have to do it just this one time.
Whoa.
That's... Okay, that's a lot of pressure on me and my uterus.
So... Well, okay.
So maybe there's something that I can do, you know, just to make sure I get pregnant.
No, I'm sorry.
Wow, you guys really don't know anything.
I know. Why doesn't she get drunk?
That worked for a bunch of girls in my high school.
Hey, guys. Do you realize that any minute now...
...Phoebe could be pregnant?
I know, I know.
It's such a huge, life-altering thing. I know.
The test is ready.
Okay. Each team will answer 10 questions.
The first team to answer the most questions wins.
The categories are "Fears And Pet Peeves"...
..."Ancient History"...
..."Literature"...

I knew that.
Rachel, use your head.
Actually, it's Miss Chanandler Bong.
Hello, teeny embryos.
Oh, I'm Phoebe Buffay. Hi.
I'm hoping to be your uterus for the next nine months.
You should know that we're doing this for Frank and Alice...
...who you know. You've been there.
You know, they want you so much.
So when you guys get in there, really grab on.
Okay, and I promise that I'll keep you safe and warm
until, you know, you're ready to have them take you home.
So...
Okay.
Oh, and also, next time you see me, if I'm screaming, don't worry.

Okay, so then play for some pepper. Stop spending my money.
I got it.
How about if we win, they have to get rid of the rooster.
Ooh, that's interesting.
Hey, no way. That rooster's family.
Throw in the duck too. What do you have against the duck? It doesn't make noise.
Well, he gets the other one all riled up.
Look, we are not... All right, hold on.
If you win

But if we win

Ooh!
Deal!

I call Monica's room. You can't just call Monica's room.

Damn.
Man, I feel like I'm coming down with something.
Oh. Yeah.
Bet you can't guess what color my tonsils are. I bet the apartment.
Oh, I would never bet this apartment. It's too nice.
Hey. Ooh, Pheebs, are they in there?
Um, yeah, uh-huh, I'm implanted.
How do you feel? Well, freaked.
Because it turns out the odds are, like, really sucky.
And this is Frank and Alice's, like, only shot.
I mean, they are, like, literally putting all their eggs in my basket.
Yeah, but I bet it works.
Really? How much?
All right, I'm gonna go take a pregnancy test right now.
Oh, wow. You can tell this soon?
Well, the doctor says it takes a couple days.
But, I mean, my body's always been a little faster than Western medicine, so...
Oh, my God. I can't believe you guys actually think you're moving in here.
Well, believe it, baby.
Well, I'm not moving.
What?
No. It was a stupid bet. We were just playing a game.
You just can't ignore the bet. It's a bet.
You bet on a bet, and if you lose, you lose the bet.
Rach, we have to move.
If we had lost, we would have made them get rid of the birds.
All right, look, I hate this as much as you, but if it makes you feel better...
this is all your fault.
What? Chanandler Bong.
Come on, we steal that TV Guide every week.
I knew it.
I don't care. I'm not going anywhere.
Cool. Girl roommate.
Well?
Nope, not knocked up yet.
It's only been a couple hours, so just give it some time.
Yeah, all right. Meanwhile, I'm gonna do whatever I can to help this...
...so I'm just gonna, you know, lie in your chair, okay?
You know, just...
Yeah, good. I'm gonna let gravity, you know, do its jobs.
Hey, Rach, can you give me a hand with this box?
No. Put that box down. We are not going anywhere!
This is my apartment and I like it.
This is a girl's apartment.
That is a boy's apartment. It's dirty and it smells.
This is pretty. It's so pretty.
And look, and it's purple.
And I'm telling you, you with your steady hand, I am not moving.
And now I have got the steady hand.
I'll take care of it. That's right.
You do what the hand says.
How'd it go? I lost our mattresses.
Are you in there, little fetus?
In nine months, will you come greet us?
I will buy you some Adidas
Hi. Hi.
Oh, hi, Phoebe?
Um, we were just at the drugstore, um, so we got you a little present.
Um, it's a lollipop and a home pregnancy test.
Hey, don't mix those up. You could really ruin that lollipop.
So, um, you feel like taking a test? There's only one question.
All right. I will. No, I will.
But, um, you know, just remember that it's still really early.
Okay, so if it says that I'm not pregnant...that doesn't mean I'm not gonna get pregnant, okay?
And just, please, just so I don't go completely nuts
just try not to put all your hopes on this, okay?
Okay.
Great.
You know what? You are mean boys who are just being mean.
Hey, don't get mad at us. No one forced you to raise the stakes.
That is not true. She did. She forced me.
We'd still be here if you hadn't got the question wrong.
Well, it was a stupid, unfair question!
Don't blame the questions!
Would you all stop yelling in our apartment?
You are ruining moving day for us.
Would you stop calling it your apartment? It is ours.
Guys, you guys, you're gonna have a baby.
They're gonna have a baby.
My sister's going to have my baby!
Okay, but this can't be good for the baby.
I can't find garbage bags.
Oh, I think I saw some in here.
What is it?
I don't know. But maybe if we keep that drawer shut, it'll die.
I can't believe we're living here.
What? What is it?
Did you see the size of the closets?!
I can't believe we live here.
Okay, she is the star of the play, and she is my girlfriend.
I get to have sex with the star of the play.
People can hear you. I know.
Wow, she looks great, doesn't she? Mm.
Hi. Hi.
That is one good-looking man.
Is it just me, or can you actually see his abs through his overcoat?
So, you been doing this long?
No. You're my first. Put the money on the table.
Oh, yeah.
Ooh, that's nice.
Dude.
Is that an expensive blouse? If you want it to be.
Here's your girlfriend's button.
Friends S04E13  The One With Rachel's Crush
Oh, hey, Mon, do you still have, like, your old blouses and dresses from high school?
Yeah, I think I have some around here somewhere. Why?
Well, it's just maternity clothes are so expensive.
Hey, Rach, I made a pile of your stuff on this side of your room.
If you could just... Ugh!
Throw your purses at it.
Bloomingdale's eliminated my department.
Oh, my God. Are you out of a job? No, they stuck me in Personal Shopping...
...which is just a huge step down.
Personal Shopping, what is that?
Like where you walk around with snooty rich people...
...and tell them what to buy?
Uh-huh. That sounds great.
Hey.
Um, excuse me, we switched apartments.
You can't eat our food anymore. That gravy train has ended.
There's gravy?
If you have the big apartment, then deal with people coming over all the time.
That fridge has got to be stocked, okay? That's your apartment now.
What are you doing? I think I left a doughnut up here.
Hey. Hey.
Oh, how was Kathy's play?
Well, Kathy gets half-naked and simulates sex...
...with a real good-looking guy.
Yeah, it was like somebody wrote down my worst nightmare...
...and then charged me $32 to see it.
That's a good idea for a business.
I'm totally screwed, okay? They're gonna be hot and heavy on-stage every night...
...and then they're gonna go to their cast parties, and he's gonna undermine me.
You know, he'll be like, "So where's your boyfriend? What's his name, Chester?"
And she'll go, "No, no, no. It's Chandler." He'll go, "Whatever. Ha-ha-ha."
That is a good trick.
All right, look, look. What am I gonna do?
Chandler, look, they're actors. They're there to do a job.
Just because they work together doesn't mean they'll get together.
Just because it happened with Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins...
...doesn't mean it's gonna happen with them.
Oh, oh. Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger.
Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman. Yeah.
Okay, Mel Gibson and Clint Eastwood.
They're not a couple.
Oh, okay, I get the game now.
Okay, look, look. Let me ask you a question.
When they were doing it on-stage, was it like really hot?
Huh. Oh, yeah.
Well, okay, so then you're fine.
Look, the rule is when two actors are actually doing it off-stage...
...then all the sexual tension between them is gone.
Okay? So as long as it's hot on-stage, you got nothing to worry about.
It's when the heat goes away, that's when you're in trouble.
Really?
You guys have been to every play I've been in.
Have I ever had chemistry on-stage?
No. No.
So, uh, man, are you gonna go see the play with me tonight?
You know what? I don't know how comfortable I am...
...going to see how hot the sex is between some guy and your girlfriend.
Yeah, I know... No, no, no, oh, I'm there.
Hey. Hey, Mon.
Want some pancakes? You made pancakes?
Yep. Grab a plate.
No, no. Stay right there.
Getting closer.
Don't worry...
...we also have cereals, muffins, waffles...
...and jams, jellies and marmalades, which I'm fairly certain are the same thing.
Also we're watching the game here Saturday, if people want to come over.
Oh, yeah.Oh.
I was having people over for the game.
Oh, yeah? Who's playing?
The players.
Somebody seems to be missing being the hostess.
Ha, ha. Please, it's a relief, is what it is, is what it is.
All right. Pheebs, stick out your plate.
Oh.
Monica, I'm quitting.
I just helped an 81-year-old woman put on a thong, and she didn't even buy it.
I'm telling you, I'm quitting, that's it. I'm talking to my boss right now.
Yes, I am. Yes, I am. Yes, I am.
Okay, bye. Call me when you get this message.
Oh! Mr. Waltham? I, uh, really need to talk to you.
In a moment, please. I'm in the middle of a task.
And you have a customer.
Hi. Hi. I'm Joshua.
Hi, I'm Rachel Green. What can I do for you, Joshua?
Well, I need a new wardrobe. My wife... Well, my ex-wife...
Oh, I'm so sorry.
Anyway, she burned all of my clothes.
So I got away with two things: This suit and what turned out to be a, uh, skirt. Heh.
Well, at least that's a great suit.
Yeah, it wasn't much fun dropping it off at the dry cleaners in the skirt.
So I need everything down to underwear.
So if you're willing, I'm, uh... I'm all yours.
Okay.
Rachel, you needed to speak to me?
No, no, that wasn't me.
Well, we should get started. Let me show you my underwear.
The selection of underwear that we carry.
Oh, I'm sorry. It's this way.It's this way? Sorry.
I'm right, right? There was, like, no chemistry between them.
Before, they had heat. And now there's no heat.
Now, you know what this means. Joey told us what this means.
Let's not jump to any conclusions, all right?
There was some sexual chemistry between them.
Oh, come on. It was like cousins having sex up there.
Here she comes. Don't say a word, okay? Just be cool. Don't be, you know, you.
Hey, you guys. Hey.
Oh, thank you so much for coming again.
Did you like it tonight? Absolutely.
Wasn't Nick funny when he couldn't get his match lit?
It's a good play, isn't it? Mm.
I loved the play. Uh, yeah, you were great.
And, uh, Nick, ditto.
Clearly, you're having sex with him.
Okay.
Clearly, I'm having sex with him?
Oh, come on. It was so obvious. There was no chemistry between you two.
Okay, let me just get this straight.
You're accusing me of cheating on you, and you're insulting my performance?
You know, I can see how this could happen.
You know, you're up there every night, naked, touching, kissing.
Acting. Chandler, this is my job.
I'm playing a part in a play. How can you not trust me?
Well, you can understand, given how we started.
I can't believe you're throwing that in my face.
Well, that is what happened, and I don't even see you denying this.
I'll tell you what, Chandler. Why don't you call me when you grow up?
Yeah, well, don't expect that to happen any time soon.
Oh, I have the best job in the entire world.
The most adorable guy came over today...
...and I got to dress him up all day.
Rachel has a new doll.
Oh, I wish he was a doll. Then I could get a Rachel doll and bump them together...
...and make kissing noises.
Oh, and he's got the most beautiful name. I never realized. Joshua.
Oh, Joshua.
Joshua, Josh.
Uh, hello?
Hi.
Ooh, what do I smell?
I don't know, but it smells good.
Fresh cookies. Hot from the oven. Ooh!
Please have some. Oh, yo.
I've just been fiddling around in here, making delicious treats for everyone.
Wow. The new Playboy.
Yeah, just something I picked up.
Cookies and porn? You're the best mom ever.
What? What?
Nothing, it's just something Joshua said about V-necks, but you had to be there.
How does, uh, Jason look in a V-neck?
It's Joshua. Oh, whatever.
Wait. Wait. This isn't takeout.
Well, hate to eat and run. No, wait, please don't go.
I've got porn for you too.
Yeah, I don't need it.
People are supposed to want to hang out here.
Why? Honey, what is the big deal?
I'm the hostess.
Not those guys. I'm always the hostess.
I mean, even when I was little, the girls brought their dollies to my tea party.
I served the best air.
Why did you make a whole big thing...
...out of everyone has to hang out in the big apartment?
'Cause they took our apartment, I wanted to punish them.
But I'm done now. They've suffered enough.
If you wanted to punish them, you should have just made them hang out here.
Yeah, that's true.
All right then, when I'm done with this place, it's gonna be ten times better than that place!
Oh, are we gonna trash their place?
Steps.
Slut.
You'll all be very happy to hear that Kathy is sleeping with that guy.
What? So you were right?
I confronted her, and she didn't deny it.
I don't live here.
Chandler. Chandler, what did she say?
Wait a minute. Come here.are you sure?
Well, I may be drunk, but I know what she said.
So then I went over to Beefsteak Chewley's...
Beefsteak Charlie's? Yes.
See, you and I have always been like:
Oops.
Hey, do you need help with that? No, I got it.
Oh, I just feel bad. I never vacuum.
Hey. Hey.
So I was with Joshua for an hour today, and he has not asked me out.
It's so frustrating. Why don't you ask him out?
Oh, yeah. Totally. That's such a turn-on.
Really? It doesn't seem desperate?
Ooh, that's the turn-on.
He just got a divorce, right? So he's probably really nervous around women.
You know? Maybe you just need to make the first move.
I've never asked a guy out before. You've never asked a guy out?
No, have you?
Thousands of times. Ha, ha.
That doesn't make me sound too good, does it?
I don't even know how I would go about it.
Oh, what I do is, uh, I look a woman up and down and I say:
"Hey.
How you doing?"
Oh, please.
Hey.
How you doing?
You know what? I'm gonna do that.
I'm gonna call him up and I'm gonna ask him out.
Yeah. I can do that. Ask him out.
"How you doing?"
Hi, Joshua?
It's Rachel Green, from Bloomingdale's.
Yeah, um, I was just wondering if you, um...
If you, um...
Left your wallet at the store today?
Oh, well, we found a wallet, and we...
The license? Oh, that is a good idea.
Uh, well, let's see. This license belongs to a, uh...
Uh, belongs to a Mr. Pheebs.
And, um, yeah.
So okay. So sorry to bother you at home. I'll see you tomorrow. Bye.
You've done that a thousand times? I've never done that.
Oh, God, I just got so nervous that he was gonna say no.
Well, you gotta give him something he can't say no too, like, uh, Knicks tickets.
Invite the guy to a Knicks game. You're guaranteed he'll say yes.
Really? You think that will work? Absolutely! And if it doesn't, can I get the extra ticket?
What the heck is that?
Did she call?
No. Sorry.
Well, maybe I should call her. No.
Forget her, man. You don't need her. Don't need that.
He's right. What she did was unforgivable.
Well, yeah, but you know, what if I was wrong?
How might you be wrong?
Well, you know, what if she didn't actually sleep with the guy?
Dude, tell me she actually told you this.
She did not have to tell me. I saw the play and there was no heat.
Back me up here, Ross. That's all your basing this on?
That's not backing me up.
You said, you know, with the off-stage and the heat...
...and the on-stage and the heat... Whoa, whoa.
That was just a theory. There's a lot of theories that didn't pan out.
Lone gunman, communism, geometry.
Oh, my God.
"Joshua, Would you like to go to a basketball game with..."
"You know, it's funny, basketball, because I happen to have tickets to..."
"Who likes the Knicks?"
What do you think? Oh.
Well, as a single woman, who is available...
...I think you look great.
Huh. Yeah? Yup.
Oh, yeah, you look great.
Oh, yeah. Yeah, this looks great.
Um, so you like it?
I do, I do. I love it. In fact, I think I'm gonna wear it home.
Great. Well, thank you so much for all your help.
Well, I guess, uh... I guess this is it. Yeah.
Thanks.
Maybe I'll see you in the spring with the... For the bathing suits.
You don't want to do that now?
Oh, that's okay.
Anyway, hopefully I'll see you around sometime.
Basketball.
Sorry?
I, uh...
I have two tickets to the Knicks game tonight if you're interested...
...just as a thank-you for this week.
Wow. That would be great.
Really? Yeah, That would be fantastic.
My nephew is crazy about the Knicks.
This is fantastic. Thank you so much, Rachel.
Good morning. Hi.
Hey. Hey.
Hey. I just, I just wanted to come over to-to say that I'm sorry.
You know, I acted like the biggest idiot in the world.
And I can completely understand why you were so upset.
I really wish you'd called me.
Yeah, I know. I wish I had too.
But, you know, I think this is a good thing. You know?
Because we've had our first fight, and now we can move on.
You know, I mean, I know for me, but...
Nick's pants?
Yeah.
Yeah. Well.
I think our second fight is going to be a big one.
Okay, for next time, what do you say? "I have an extra ticket."
"An extra ticket." Not "two tickets." I have and extra ticket.
So the first time you asked a guy out he turned you down?
He didn't turn me down. He's at the game, isn't he?
I got the date. I'm just not on it.
Okay, it's ready.
Come on. What's ready?
Just come.
Oh, my God.
Wow. Monica, this is beautiful.
Oh, did you work for two days straight?
Pretty much.
So, what do you think of the floor?
I don't know. Looks the same.
You used to have carpet.
Oh, yeah.
So I made snacks.
Please, just hang out, okay?
I'm just gonna rest my eyes for just a little bit.
Mon, do you want us to come back later?
Oh, no, no, no. Stay, stay, stay. Just keep talking.
I'm always the hostess.
Hey. How'd it go?
So? Well, she wasn't sleeping with him.
Oh, good. She is now.
What are you saying? I'm saying that she is a devil woman.
You think you know a person...
...then they turn around and they sleep with Nick.
Nick and his rock-hard pecs and his giant man-nipples.
I hate him. And I hate her.
Well, I don't hate her. I love her. This is all my fault, really.
Oh. How? How is it your fault?
Because, ugh, I should have called.
You know, if I'd just called her, she never would have gone out with Nick...
...and they wouldn't have ended up in bed together.
I threw her at his man-nipples.
Honey, this is not your fault.
Just because you guys had a fight does not justify her sleeping with someone.
Well, if she thought they were on a break...
Rachel, one of your customers seems to have left his billfold. A Joshua Burgen.
Really? Will you call him?
Yes, I will. Absolutely.
Hello, Rachel.
Hi, Joshua.
I left my wallet here on purpose.
Really?
Yes, I just wanted to see you again.
Oh, I'm glad.
Rachel, I'd like to say something to you.
Yes?
How you doing?
So, now, what is this, now?
Googlie Worm. Ha-ha-ha.
And this?
Glow Pop Jiggly Jam.
Bait is so funny.
Hey, um, what's this?
Oh, a hunk of sandwich from last year.
Oh, Geller's got one hooked. Oh! Looks like a big one. Oh! Oh!
It's the classic struggle between man...
Someone knocked over a lamp.
Hey, you know what's gonna be great about the fishing trip?
When my dad gives me that, "Joey, what are you doing with your life?" stuff...
...I can say, "Well, I'm doing a movie with Charlton Heston, Dad.
What are you doing with your life?" Aw.
Great!
You don't have to stop having fun just because I'm here.
Kathy didn't cheat on all of you.
Well, except you.
Hey, Joey, I don't think you should leave Chandler alone.
I mean it's only been two days since he broke up with Kathy.
Maybe you can go fishing next week.
Look, There's nothing I can do right now. He's still in his sweatpants.
That's only phase one.
You know? I'll be back for phase two. I would never miss phase two.
What's phase two?
Getting drunk and going to a strip club.
How does going to a strip club make him better?
There are naked ladies there.
It helps him get to phase three, picturing yourself with other women.
There are naked ladies there too. Yeah.
Would you give me one minute, please?
Friends S04E14  The One With Joey's Dirty Day
So these will match the jacket you picked out for me last week?
There we go.
There it is.
Oh, you know what I need? Yeah?
Gloves. Brown leather dress gloves. Oh, okay.
Uh, well, let's see. You're about a... Well, this one is large. Ha, ha.
And, uh, this one...
Also a large? Yeah. Okay.
Yeah. Two larges coming right up. Ha, ha.
Rachel, could I have a moment? Yes.
I was wondering, my niece, you see, is in town from London.
Uh-huh. Shropshire, really, but you know.
She's about your age, I'd say.
Anyway, I have tickets for the opera. Die Fledermaus.
and I was wondering if you would keep her company this evening.
Sure. You got it. Oh, good.
Count me in. Me, Fledermaus. Great. I really
Oh, yes, of course. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so very much.
So?
So...
Gloves? Oh, right. Sorry, I'll be right back.
Actually, you know what? I gotta take off.
But I was curious, do you have any plans for tonight?
No, nothing.
I invested in this night-club and it's opening tonight, Would you like to come?
Yeah, that would be great.
You're into hard-core S and M, right?
Well, I guess. I'm kidding.
I'm gonna get there early, but I'm going to put you on the V.I.P list, Look for me.
Yeah. Great. You betcha. I'll see you tonight.
Okay. Okay.
I almost forgot the tickets, didn't I? What?
For you and Emily. Tonight. Die Fledermaus.
Oh. Oh, right.
I think you'll like it. It has two of the Three Tenors.
Okay.
Y'know,I can't believe Kathy did this to me. I really thought that she was the one.
Well, I'll tell you what.
From now on, I am not getting out of this chair, ever.
Okay? From now on, this chair is the one.
You know what else is the one? My sweat pants.
Come on, man, just take the sweats off, okay?
Just take them off and we'll have some fun.
Hey. Hi.
Did you catch any big fish? Oh, my God, you guys have no idea.
Oh, wow. Oh, my God, you stink.
Oh, are you kidding?
Yeah, three days on the lake without a shower.
Plus, I fell into that big tub of worms at the bait stand.
Hey, how's he doing?
He hasn't gotten out of that chair in two days.
Ahem. Hey, buddy, how's it going?
You see that? He just needed his pal to come home.
All right, uh, I gotta go memorize my lines.
Me and Charlton Heston, bright and early tomorrow, baby.
Yeah. Yeah.
Hey. Hey.
Hey. Hey, Monica.
Uh-oh. What's the matter? Oh...
Joshua invited me to this fancy club opening tonight.
But I already told Mr. Waltham...
...that I would take his niece to the dumb old opera.
So, what are you gonna do?
I don't know, sweetie. No. Help me.
I can't. I have to work. Phoebe?
I would, but I get my morning sickness in the evening.
Ooh, no, unless she wants to spend the night holding my hair back for me.
Ugh. Gosh, you guys, come on. This is... I have to meet Joshua.
This is my one chance for him to see the fun Rachel.
You know, the "Wouldn't it be great if she were my wife?" Rachel.
Ohh, all right! Are Joey and Chandler back?
Oh, Chandler's still in phase one, and Joey's that thing you smell.
Hi.
Hi!
So?
No.
Oh, come on.
I think she's here. No, wait, wait, wait. Ross, please?
You want me to take some girl I've never met to the opera...
...so you can go to a club and flirt with some guy?
Hmm. Yeah, that is a toughie.
Oh, she's looking down the hall.
Oh! She looked right at me.
Oh, wait, you can't see people through that little hole, can you?
Hello.
Hello? Aah!
Oh, I'll be right there. Okay, Ross, please. Come on.
I thought we had moved on.
I thought we'd gotten to a place where we could be happy for each other.
I mean was that just me?
All right, I'll do it. Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you.
Emily? Yes.
I'm Rachel Green. Thank goodness.
There's been a teeny-teeny change in plans. It turns out that I'm not free tonight. So…
Really? Heh.
Well, that's just lovely, isn't it? I must've missed your call, even though I didn't leave the flat all day.
Well, no, I... No, no, no, that's not rude.
It's perfectly in keeping with a trip...
...where I've already been run down by one of your wiener carts...
...and been strip-searched at John F. Kennedy Airport.
Apparently, I look like someone...
...who's got a balloon full of cocaine stuffed up their bum.
I-I-I think you look great.
Good night. It was very nice to meet you all.
I'll get her.
Please hurry. Okay.
Don't you just love the way they talk?
What? It kicked. I think the baby kicked.
Oh, my God. Ha, ha.
Oh, no, wait. Oh. That was the elastic in my underwear busted.
Oh, my God. I overslept.
I was supposed to be on the set a half an hour ago. I gotta get out of here.
What? Joey, you can't go like that. You stink.
Look, I know I feel asleep before I could shower and now I don't have time!
They're 10 blocks away. If I run, I can make it.
Yeah, run 10 blocks. That'll help the smell.
Hey. Whoa! Slow down. No, keep moving. Whoa.
So how did it go with Joshua last night? Oh. Well, I didn't see Joshua.
But I did punch a girl in the face.
What? Why?
The whole night was horrible. It was pouring rain.
and when I got there, there was no Rachel Green on the list, but there was a Rachel Greep.
Oh. So did you get to meet her?
No, there is no Rachel Greep. But then this other girl overheard us.
And she was all, "I'm Rachel Greep, I'm Rachel Greep," and he let her in.
So you hit her in the face? No, she was already in.
But then this big bitch behind me tried to steal my umbrella...
...so I clocked her.
Ugh. I can't believe this.
All I wanted was just a few hours outside of work to see Joshua...
...so that he could go ahead and start falling in love with me.
Aw. Pheebs.
Honey, that's your name.
That's short for Phoebe? I thought that's what we called each other.
Hey, you're wearing pants. That's right.
Where are the guys? I'm ready to get drunk and see strippers.
It's 9:30 in the morning. They got a breakfast buffet.
Hello? Oh, hey, Ross. Ooh. Let me talk to him.
Oh, my God.
Can't I just...? Shh. Wait, what?
It's my phone and she's shush... Shh. Please.
What's he saying?
He's with Emily at a bed and breakfast in Vermont.
What? Oh, my God.
What? Who the hell is Emily? Noooo!!
They're in Vermont? How did this happen?
Ow.
How—How did he end up in Vermont with that awful witch?
Maybe she doesn't hit him all the time.
When we first met her...
...she was soaking, her feet were wet.
Who wouldn't be miserable?
I'm telling you when I got her into a dry pair of shoes, she was a totally different person.
Ross, come quickly. There's a deer outside eating fruit from the orchard.
I gotta go! There's a deer outside eating fruit from the orchard!
He had to go, there's a deer just outside eating fruit from the orchard.
I don't get this. She was horrible.
Okay, I'm gonna go stand over there.
Why do you care so much, anyway? I don't care.
You know what? I'm just upset that I'm getting nowhere with Joshua.
Know what? Still, you do not just meet someone and go flitting off to Vermont.
Well, when you first met Barry, you flitted off to Vail.
Ugh. You know, could you just for once not remember every little thing?
So, you know, when's he getting back?
A couple of days. Know what? I knew something like this was gonna happen.
What are you doing?
Chandler. You can't just go back a phase.
Yes, you can. You're thinking about time. You can't go back in time.
Why don't you just...? Why don't you do your phase-two strip-club thing with us?
Yeah, come on, we can be guys. Heh. No, you can't.
Come on, let us be guys. Maybe we wanna be guys.
You don't wanna be guys.
You'd be all hairy and you wouldn't live as long.
You know, you...
Would you just stop being such a wuss and get those off?
And you come with us and watch naked girls dance around.
Okay.
I'm sorry.
Hey, Joey Tribbiani. I'm here, I'm here.
Calm down, we got time. We're running a little late.
All set.
Look at that. Charlton Heston eating a licorice whip.
Yeah, he loves them. I've never seen him with...
Whoa. Yeah. What the hell is that? What smells so bad?
You. Oh.
I could see why you would think that. But actually, you know who I think it is?
You? No, no. It's Heston.
What? The man reeks.
Smells like he went on a three-day fishing trip and then ate licorice. Ick.
There's no way he smells.
He's the only one around here with a shower in his dressing room.
Really? A shower, huh? And, uh, which room might that be?
The one with "Heston" on it.
Interesting.
Hey. I got some ones. You wanna put them in her panties?
No, thanks, Mom.
Oh. No. Um, hi. That, that.
You have to put that out because I'm pregnant, so...
Well, maybe you and your baby ought to go to another strip club.
Heh, heh. It's not my baby. Heh, heh.
Very good. Yes. That was so good.
Really, really enjoyed it. Very exotic.
Well, I just checked our messages, and Joshua didn't call.
I mean you'd think he'd be worried about me not showing up at his club.
Ugh. And you know what makes it worse? Ross is all happy in Vermont.
Come on, look where you are.
When you get a sec, another round of daiquiris.Remember, virgin for me, please.
Oh, and don't let me leave without getting the name of that carpet guy.
Oh, come on.
You know what? I'm just gonna go home and call Kathy.
Well, if you think it'll help. No. That was a test.
In a couple hours, I'm gonna get drunk and wanna call Kathy...
...and you have to stop me.
Then I'm gonna be so drunk, I'm gonna wanna call Janice.
You should. How is she? Oh!
I think somebody needs another lap dance.
Hello? Who's in there?
How you doing?
Who in the hell are you?
Uh, guess you wouldn't believe me if I said I was Kirk Douglas, huh?
Put some pants on, kid, so I can kick your butt.
No, no, no, wait. You don't understand.
You see, I'm an actor.
Joey Tribbiani. I'm doing a scene with you today.
And, well, I stink.
You're in this picture? Yeah, yeah.
I'm one of the cops who won't work with you because you're a loose cannon.
Anyway, look, I'm really sorry, but I just... I stink.
Joey, right? Yeah.
Every actor, one time or another... Ah.
Every actor thinks he stinks.
Even Laurence Olivier sometimes thought he stank.
Bob Redford won't even watch himself. No, no, no, you don't understand.
Listen to me. No... Yeah.
I don't know one actor worth his salt...
...who one time in his career didn't say, "God, I stink."
Hell, I just did a scene out there. First take, I stunk the place up.
But the important thing that you must remember...
...no matter how badly you think you stink...
...you must never, ever bust into my dressing room and use my shower.
Do you understand me?
Yes, sir. Yes, sir. I'm very sorry. Wait a minute.
Take your pants. Yeah. Oh, yeah.
So we did okay at the strip club, right? Oh, yeah. That was great.
Thanks to you, the hottest cocktail waitress there is quitting...
...to teach the third grade.
I can't believe it. He still hasn't called.
Who, Josh? It's "Joshua."
What, he doesn't like "Josh"? No, I don't.
All right. Well, I'm gonna put my sweats back on.
Oh no! wait. You know what? You were right, you were right.
We really weren't great at being guys. But do you know why?
Because we're girls.
Yeah. Do you know what girls are good at?
Stripping.
No, listening. Sit.
You know, maybe it would really, really help if you would just talk.
Yeah, come on. What's going on in there?
And you know, if you wanna cry, that's okay too.
Okay, look, I'm gonna have to ask you all to leave.
Come on, Chandler.
Look, forget it. We tried, but phase three is a lost cause.
Okay? Those strippers were insanely hot...
...and I couldn't picture myself with any of them.
They really were pretty, weren't they? Oh.
I really liked that fighter pilot one. Oh, Candy?
Oh, she was so spunky. Yeah.
You know, I think if I were gonna be with a woman...
...it'd be with someone like Michelle.
She was... Oh, she was just so petite.
See, I don't know. For me, it would have to be Chantal.
Oh, Chantal, yeah. Chantal.
You know? Oh, my God. The... Oh.
She had the smoothest skin.
I mean, when I stuck that dollar bill in her G-string and grazed her thigh...Phase three!
I just achieved phase three!
Really?
I am totally picturing you with all those women.
That's not phase three. Well, I'm there too.
Well, are we all together? Like in a group? Stop it, you're killing me.
I think I just moved on to phase four.
Oh, what is that? What is that? Where I don't want a relationship ever.
I just wanna have sex with strippers and my friends.
Come on. Let me see that smile.
I don't wanna.
Please?
I wanted to go to the strip club.
I know, You're gonna have plenty of chances, okay?
There are thousands of women out there who are just waiting to screw me over.
Yeah, all right.
Hey. Hey.
Hey. Ooh, how was Vermont?
Emily is incredible.
I mean, there are no words to describe her.
The whole weekend was like a dream.
Oh. And you. Rach. Hey. Oh, hey.
You were so right. What?
What you said about us finally being in a place...
...where we could really be happy for each other.
Hmm. I mean, I...
I admit, I wasn't quite there. Mm-hm.
You know, I mean, the thought of you and that Josh guy...
"Joshua." Joshua guy at that club...
...dancing, having a good time.
the thought of it kinda
You know? Yeah.
But now, but now, I'm totally there.
I'm finally where you are.
Oh, thank goodness.
Yeah, and thank you for Emily.
Oh, no problem. I'm so glad I could help, you know?
I'm happy for you.
Happy for you.
Oh, no, happy for you.
All right, ladies, here's what we're gonna do.
You are gonna take off my clothes.
You two go get the oils.
And you constantly scream at the top of your voice:
"Chandler's the king! Chandler's the king!"
No, I wanna be with her. I like her.
Oh, that's fine. Go with your instincts. Go with your instincts.
Wait, what am I doing again?
Would you please pay attention? I could wake up at any moment.
Hi, I'm Joshua. I'm here to pick up Rachel.
No, no, no, that's not Joshua.
What do you want from me? I never met the guy.
So anyway, Rachel, I'm sorry you can't stay. The rest of us have a lot of work to do.
What are you doing?
All right, listen, I've got to wake up!
I'm can't believe I'm getting my nails done.
And you said it was gonna be fun.
Which it kind of is.
Also, you said there would be other guys here. There are no other guys here!
Chandler, there's a guy right over there. That's a mailman.
That's our mailman.
Hi, how are you?
Chandler, don't worry. This doesn't make you any less of a guy.
That does.
What am I sitting on?
Heh. I'd hate to think what this woman was scratching when this broke off.
Hey, you know who used to have nails like that? No.
Oh, my God.
Friends S04E05  The One With All The Rugby
Joey, let me ask you a question. This has been driving me crazy.
What does this light switch do? Oh, nothing.
Didn't it drive you crazy to have a switch and not know what it did?
I know what it did. Nothing.
They wouldn't have put it there if it didn't do something.
How can you not care? Like this:
Well, here's another question for you.
Do you know what that little silver knob on the toilet does?
Sure. It flushes it. Okay, good.
Now, since you know, when you come over, would you mind actually using it?
Hello. Hey. Aah!
Oh, my God. Wow. Guess who we ran into today?
Janice. Is this amazing?
How have you been? Well, um, I'm divorced.
Wow. Really?
Yeah, I'm riding the alimony pony.
And there it is.
I just came up to say hi. Hi.
You, sweetie, I'll see you later. Okay.
Mwah. I'll see you tonight.
Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye.
Bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Oh.
I can't stand the woman.
What? I thought you were crazy about her.
I know, you know all those little annoying things she did before we fell in love?
like her voice and her laugh and her personality?
Well, they're all back, you know.
And she's picked up like nine new ones.
So, what are you doing bringing her here? There's people here.
Don't worry about it. I'm taking care of it tonight.
You are not. You have never been able to break up with her.
Well, I don't have to break up with her this time.
We're not involved. I'm gonna do a preemptive strike.
I'm gonna end it with her before it starts.
My ass is, like, frozen.
Yeah, try sticking it in the freezer for 20 minutes.
I'm telling you.
I can't believe you really walk alone here at night.
I mean, you hear such stories about New York.
No, it's really not that bad.
I mean, I, for one, feel perfectly safe.
Help! Help! Help!
No, no, no, Ross. Ross, these are friends of mine from home.
Liam, Devon, this is Ross. Oh. Heh.
Hi, mate. Hey.
How are you, man? Ha, ha.
Oh hey, that was a good one, huh? I was like, "Help! Help!"
So how are you?
I've been meaning to ring you ever since I arrived...
...but, um, well, I've been rather busy.
Do you realize we have not seen each other since the night of that U2 concert?
Ah. Oh, my God, I think you're right.
Well, actually, the last time you and I saw each other was the next morning.
Ha, ha. Oh, Liam.
Heh. Oh, Liam.
So, what, were you guys playing soccer or something?
Or should I call it...
..."football"? Uh...
We were playing rugby.
In fact, we're playing a game at the park tomorrow. You're welcome to play too if you want.
Ha, ha. Ross play rugby? I don't think so.
Heh. What?
What's so funny about that?
Well, I mean, you're American to start with.
You don't really have rugby here.
Heh. Well, we didn't have freedom here until 1776 either, so...
So good then. We'll see you at Riverside Park at 2:00!
Cheers. Cheers.
Oh, boy. I just love to sing.
Yes, I know that you do.
but I think one of the reasons people were complaining...
...was because most of the people had paid to hear the actor sing "Old Man River."
Oh, look at us.
Who would've thought that Cupid had a station at 14th Street Nails?
Okay, we have to talk.
I'm just getting out of a very serious relationship.
I know. And I'm just getting out of a marriage.
I mean, talk about meant to be.
Right. But I just think this is happening too soon.
Oh, too soon, too schmoon.
Face it honey, I am not letting you get away this time.
I hear you. Ha, ha.
But unfortunately, my company...
...is transferring me overseas.
Oh, no.
Where to?
To Paris? No. No, not Paris.
To London? Oh. No, Rome? Vienna? Ooh, ooh. Barcelona?
Okay, could you just stop talking for a second?
Yemen.
That's right. Yes. I'm being transferred to Yemen.
When? I don't know exactly.
Well, I will just have to soak up every ounce of Chandler Bing...
...until that moment comes.
But I do know it's sometime tomorrow.
Done? Yep.
Hey. Hey.
What's up?
This switch thing has been driving me crazy.
So I turned it off and checked every outlet.
Now, four don't work, which means one of them has to be controlled by the switch.
So I plugged in things in all four outlets that make noise.
That way, when I turn it on, I just follow the noise...
...and find out which one it is.
I bet I stopped listening before you did.
You know, you also could have used lamps...
...and then followed the light.
Yeah, well, I'm using noise. Okay?
All right, so everybody ready?
Here we go.
There's something. I hear something. Where is it?
It's coming from Joey.
Oh, my God. That's so freaky. Turn him off.
With the set scrum in center field.
Oh, hey. Hi.
Could we put on the news? I think it might be raining.
No, just hold on a sec. I'm watching this rugby thing on ESPN.
I don't know what the big deal is. I'm man enough to play this sport.
Dude, you're not even man enough to order the channel that carries the sport.
Hey there, Ross.
Hey.
Janice.
You know, uh, you really didn't have to help me pack.
Oh. When you said all you were gonna be doing...
...between now and the time you leave is packing...
..you really didn't leave me much choice.Did you?
Well, I thought I did, but I guess I did not.
Hey. What's going on? Oh, I'm packing.
You know, I'm packing because I'm moving to Yemen tomorrow.
Thanks for telling me.
I'm only pretend-moving to Yemen, okay? It's the only way I can get rid of her.
Oh. Good one.
And Yemen. That actually sounds like a real country.
Hey, Chandler, come on.
I'm gonna show you how to roll your underwear and stuff it in your shoes.
It's a real space-saver. I do that because it makes me look taller.
Hey, Chandler. Come on.
Okay.
Joey, trade lives with me. Nope.
Man, look at this. Ross, I can't believe you said you'd play.
Look how brutal this is. Hey, I can handle it, all right?
Oh, please, Ross.
You got hurt playing badminton with my dad.
That's because your mom's dog kept looking at me.
Okay, Ross, look, look, look. Right here, it's called a "scrum," okay?
It's kind of like a huddle. And is a hum kind of like a scruddle?
Ross, they're gonna kill you.
Why are you doing this, anyway?
Well, you should've seen the guy that she used to go out with.
I mean, he's like Joe Rugby.
You're kidding. And he plays rugby? That's so funny.
Oh, I see. You did that. All right.
Anyway, she thought the very idea of me playing rugby with him was, like, hilarious.
So I'm gonna show her how tough I really am.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. You're right. You are a tough guy.
You're the toughest paleontologist I know.
All right, come on.
Look, Ross can take care of himself. It's not like he's Chandler.
Thanks.
Look, don't worry about me.
I'll just look real energetic and stay away from the ball.
I'll be that guy, right outside the circle.
Ooh. Oh!
Oh, jeez.
Oh. Well, maybe there was a dog looking at him.
Okay, Ross, Ross, Ross.
You're gonna wanna stay away from that guy and that guy and that one.
Dude, they're all huge.
They don't look any bigger than me.
That's because you're closer to you.
So you look bigger to you from where you are.
I'm just gonna go and say hello to the lads.
All right. Okay.
Hi.
Oh.
I kind of liked it.
Okay, I know what I've gotta do. I've gotta go Red Ross.
You know, Red Ross?
Totally don't know what you're talking about.
That time that we were all waiting in line for Dances With Wolves...
...and that one guy cut in front of us, and I just lost it?
Huh? Screamed at him, turned all red.
Red Ross!
No.
You'll see.
Liam, do me a favor.
Tell the lads to go easy on Ross. It's his first time.
You don't say?
Thanks. Okay.
Good luck, babe.
Ross. Ross, come on, get in here.
Ross, come on.
Ross.
Ross, come on, get in the bloody scrum.
Ross, get in.
Joey!
Oh. You are not gonna believe it. Joshua came in today, and guess what happened?
He asked you out? No.
But I was showing him some cuff links, and I felt his pulse.
Saucy.
What are these? Oh. Electrical plans for the building.
Okay, okay, okay, should I be scared?
I know that switch has gotta do something. So I went to City Hall and I got these.
All I had to do was pay $25 and wait in line for three hours.
Wow. If only more people knew.
You know, you really didn't have to take me to the airport.
Oh, please. Every moment is precious.
Besides, somebody had to ride in that other taxi with your luggage.
And your friends don't seem to care very much that you're leaving.
Well, we're not really that close.
Okay. So I guess this is, uh, you know, goodbye, then.
Oh, no, no.
It's not goodbye. I'm not leaving until you get on that plane.
Okay, well, I guess it's just "wait here," then.
Hi. I need a fake ticket to Yemen.
One ticket to Yemen? Oh, no, no, no.
I just need a pretend ticket.
I'm sorry, sir, I don't understand.
What would you give to a kid if he wanted a ticket to play with?
Are you traveling with a child?
No.
Oh. y'know what, She's gonna think that I'm handing you a credit card.
But what I'm really gonna do is hand you a library card.
Uh, sir, a ticket to Yemen is $2100, and we don't take library cards.
What's the matter? Is something wrong?
Do you have to stay?
American Express?
Ross!
Oh. Ah.
I can't believe they're doing that to him. I told them to go easy on him.
No offense, but sometimes it's hard to understand you...
...you know, with the accent, so...
That's just halftime. There's more of this. Oh.
Hey. Hey.
Hey.
Did you see me? I was pretty good, huh? That is one fun game.
Right. Do me a favor? Grab me a bottle of water?
Yeah. Thanks.
I think I'm dying. I really do. Oh, poor baby.
Tell my son that I love him.
Oh, excellent. Okay, gotta have some more fun.
Ross, they are killing you out there.
That's not true. She's right. You have to stop.
What? No. No, I'm not stopping. I'm Red Ross.
Dude, you go back out there, you're gonna be Dead Ross.
I don't care. I am not quitting. I am gonna finish this game.
All right. If you insist on doing this, at least let me help you.
God, no. That is no place for a woman. Those guys will grab anything.
That's not what I was saying.
I just might know a few things that could help you inflict some pain.
I like that. Yeah? Listen closely.
Devon has got a weak ankle. Huh?
One swift kick and he'll back off.
All right, bad ankle. Got it.
And that big bloke with the beard? Uh-huh.
He's got a trick hip. Ha, ha.
Yeah. And David over there, I heard that he doesn't wear a cup.
Real...? I could use that. Trick hip, no cup. Okay, okay.
And Liam. Liam's got bad knees.
You hit him right and he'll go down like a lamp.
But Liam's on my team.
I don't care. You just get him. Go get him.
Okay. I am going back in.
Red Ross. Yeah.
Hi. Hi.
What are these?
Oh, just some pictures I made and hung up.
I thought they'd brighten up the place. They do, don't you think?
Aah! No, no, don't, don't.
Oh!
I know that there's no hole there. I just really like that picture.
Oh, my God. Look at this.
But there is a wire back there. That switch is connected to something.
I don't care. The wires have come loose in your head.
I thought if I could follow the wire, I could find out what it did.
And did you? No.
It disappears back behind that baseboard.
For a minute there, I thought it went downstairs.
But it didn't.
Say hello to Mrs. Catrokis. Oh, my God.
Hello, darling. Hello, Mrs. Catrokis.
Are you sure you don't wanna go see a doctor?
Oh, no, that'll just bring me down.
This was great. I mean, I was great. This was a great day.
You know what? I'm buying everyone coffee.
Someone just grab my wallet. It's in my pocket.
Yeah, sure. No, not you.
Okay.
Look, your eye's still popping out a little. I'm gonna go get some ice.
Okay. Ooh, ice, yeah. I'm so in the mood for ice.
You were amazing out there. Oh.
I kind of was, wasn't I? Oh, my God.
I made a man twice my size cry.
I mean, I haven't done that since I was 4 and I washed my dad's Porsche with rocks.
You really enjoyed yourself, didn't you?
Please, are you kidding? I hurt three huge men.
I gave a guy a bloody nose.
I mean, I'm not proud of it...
...but I really am.
And it's all because of you.
Yeah. Wonderful, amazing you. I think you've got a concussion.
No, no, I'm serious. Thank you.
You're welcome.
I'm sorry. Did that hurt you? It's worth the pain.
You know what? You know what? It's not.
This is the final boarding call for Flight 664 to Yemen.
Well, I guess I gotta go.
Oh. My Bing-a-ling.
I'll wait for you.
Do you even know how long you're gonna be gone?
Well, just until we find an energy source to replace fuel.
Oh. Well, I'll write you every day.
15 Yemen Road, Yemen.
Okay. Goodbye.
Goodbye.
Chandler? No.
Chandler.
Janice. There you are. There you are. I had to have one last kiss.
And also, also, you said you were gonna leave right after I got on the plane.
No. No. I wanna see you take off.
Well, then I guess I'm going to Yemen.
I'm going to Yemen.
When we get to Yemen, can I stay with you?
All right. The super couldn't figure out what it did.
The $200-an-hour electrician couldn't figure out what it did.
I've had seven pretty serious shocks.
I officially give up. Thank God.
I guess Joey was right.
It does nothing.
See?
I'm doing it. I am totally doing it.
I lost it.
What is it?
Nothing. I can't find anything that I want to eat.
Everything makes me nauseous.
I'm telling you, being pregnant is no piece of cake. Oh, cake.
No.
Aw, honey, I'm sorry. God.
Ooh, what is that smell? It's coming from the bathroom.
Wow, pregnancy does give you some weird cravings.
Yeah. It's me. It's Phoebe.
Listen, there's something in here I want to eat. What?
What smells so good?
Is it the shampoo? It's guava.
No.
Ugh. Oh, wait, wait.
Is it my bologna sandwich?
Yes, yes, yes.
I can't believe it. The baby wants bologna. The baby wants me to eat meat.
I can't eat meat. Uh, wait, wait.
Maybe it's the pickle.
Friends S04E16  The One With The Fake Party
What are you writing?
Well, Joshua's coming in tomorrow...
...and since I don't have the guts to ask him out...
...I'm gonna sell him a coat and put this note in the pocket.
Oh, yeah? Oh.
"Joshua, give me a call sometime. Guys like you...
...never go out of style."
What did you throw away?
Hi, guys. Hey, what have you guys been up to?
Oh, we went to see a collection of Victorian doorknobs at the Cooper-Hewitt museum.
Without me?
My uncle dragged us there, but actually it turned out to be interesting.
Yeah. They were so ornate and beautiful.
I mean, look at that.
I don't know how museums work in England...
...but here, you're not supposed to take stuff.
I, uh... I got it from the gift shop.
They have really lax security there.
It's a joke.
Bye.
Right, I've got to be off. I'll see you. Bye-bye, then.
Bye.
Wow. Hey, you guys seem to be having a good time.
Oh, yeah, she is amazing, and she's so much fun.
And you know what? When I'm with her, I'm fun.
I even signed up for helicopter classes.
She's leaving in two days. I don't have to do it.
Aw, two days? You must be bummed. Yeah.
She's got to go back to London.
But you know what? I've been prepared for this from the start.
We both knew we had two weeks together and then that's it, you know?
Hey, that's what all my relationships are like.
Yes, but in Ross' case, they both know in two weeks that's it.
Pheebs, hey.
Hello, hello. Yeah, I know. Yeah.
So the baby is totally craving meat.
This afternoon, I tried tricking it.
I made it a soy burger so that maybe it'd think it was getting meat.
You know? And I got nauseous.
Well, maybe that's because soy burgers suck.
Being pregnant is hard on your tummy.
Hey, but at least you got that cool, pregnant-lady glow.
Oh, that's sweat. You throw up all morning, you'll have that glow too.
Okay. Uh, here's that trench coat you wanted.
Oh, great. Great.
Wow, yeah, it's comfortable. Yeah.
Man, you could really flash somebody in this thing.
Ha, ha. They don't want you to put your hands in the pockets...
...until you are out of the store.
Why not?
Well, because
we get a lot of
You know, they ruin it for everybody.
I know.
You know, I wore that cashmere sweater on a date last night.
Oh. It was the first date since the divorce.
Well, congratulations. So do you love her?
No, no, no. She's nice, but, you know, it made me realize...
...I'm just not ready to be dating, you know?
Huh.
Well, uh...
That's, uh... That's interesting.
What was that? Oh, that's just an antitheft device.
Then what's this?
Well, you need that too, because obviously a thief could just tear this up.
Listen, we have to have a party tonight.
We have to have one in five minutes, so everybody cancel your plans.
What? Yeah, what's going on?
We have to have a surprise bon-voyage party for Emily.
But it's actually for Joshua.
Look, he said he's not ready to date.
So I had to invite him to a party if I wanted to see him outside work.
And now I have created the perfect opportunity to seduce him.
Well, as much as I'd like to meet Josh and warn him...
...Emily and I aren't gonna be here, all right?
She's gonna come by first to say goodbye.
And then I've got a whole special evening planned. So sorry. No party.
Hello? Surprise!
Surprise!
No one's ever thrown me a surprise party before.
Well, it was all Ross' idea.
You're so sweet.
And I'm so surprised.
You really didn't know?
Why are you over here if Joshua's all the way over there?
Uh, because I'm trying to play hard-to-get.
Oh, quick. He's looking over here. Say something funny.
Like what? Ha-ha-ha.
What's so funny?
I said, "Like what?"
Now that's a thinker.
Okay, you know what? This playing-hard-to-get thing is not working.
Uh, hand me those cherries. Okay.
Okay.
Hi. Hey.
Care for a cherry? No, thanks.
You know, I can tie one of these into a knot using just my tongue.
You okay?
You all right?
So we should probably get going soon.
Oh, but the party's only just getting started.
Yeah, but we have to be at The Four Seasons for drinks in, oh, 15 minutes.
And then, uh, you know, then the Plaza for dinner.
So why did you plan a party at the same time?
No, no, no. Ha, ha.
Actually, American surprise parties are very short.
It's usually, "Surprise!" Then, "Oh, my God, I'm so surprised. Goodbye."
Ross, I'm having such a great time.
Your sister has just been telling me that you used to dressed up like old ladies...
...and host make-believe tea parties.
Monica said that, did she?
Oh, yeah. Then what are you going to put on top of that?
A little salami. Ooh, yeah. Yeah.
Then, um, what goes on top of the salami?
Pastrami. Oh, yeah.
You're a genius.
Can someone give me a hand with the zipper.
Up.
You changed? Yeah, I just needed my lucky dress.
And "lucky" means "more cleavage"? Does for me.
Oh, God, look at him. He's so cute.
I just want to go over there and grab him and kiss him.
How could I kiss him without letting him know that I like him?
Hey, I know how you can get him. Take off your bra.
What?
There was a scene in Footloose... Flashdance.
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, with that plumber girl? She was a welder.
Were you, like, in the movie?
Anyway, she takes off her bra under the shirt...
...and pulls it out the sleeve.
Very sexy. And classy.
Or if you wanna kiss him, um, you could use mistletoe.
It's not Christmas.
Or spin the bottle. And he's not 11.
Thank you so much for this. It was really so thoughtful of you.
You're leaving?
Yes, we have something we have to get to. Uh, yeah, I think I'm gonna take off too.
No, you guys, you can't leave yet. You have to stay.
We've got the whole big thing planned.
What big thing?
So, Spin-The-Bottle works like this.
I spin the bottle.
Lands on Gunther, so I would have to kiss Gunther.
All right.
Who wants to go first?
I'll go.
Welcome to America.
All right.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my gosh. Two in a row. You gotta use your tongues now.
All right.
What are the odds? What are the odds?
Okay, that's enough, you know. Ha, ha.
Let's let someone else play.
Hey, if you didn't want to play, then why'd you come to the party?
Okay, my turn.
Oh! Look at that.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. The baby just kicked.
It's okay, it's okay. If it kicked once, it'll kick again.
All right, well, everybody just remember where they were sitting.
It was a bug.
It doesn't matter how much I'm craving it.
You know why I'm never gonna eat meat? Because it's cold-blooded murder.
Okay.
There's a Phoebe on my sandwich.
Phoebe, what are you doing?
I can't help it.
I need the meat. The baby needs the meat.
You know how when you're dating someone...
..and you don't want to cheat on them unless it's with someone really hot?
Yeah, totally. All right, okay.
Well, this is the same kind of deal.
If you're gonna do something wrong...
...do it right.
Feel better?
Yeah, but at what cost?
Six more months, three meals a day?
I'm gonna eat like, you know, millions of cows.
Hey, what if I said I could even things out for you, meat-wise?
What? Well, I eat a lot of meat, right?
Yeah. But suppose, until the baby's born...
...I laid off it.
No extra animals would die. You'd just be eating my animals.
Joey, I can't believe you'd do that for me.
Absolutely. I could be a vegetarian.
There's no meat in beer, right?
Okay, we can still make dinner if we skip the appetizers...
...and ask for our check right away.
We can't go now. Looks like Rachel is going to put on a skit.
Oh, my God. Have you lost your mind?
No, no, no. I am finally thinking clearly.
My lucky dress wasn't working out too well for me.
But for four years, this baby never missed.
Rachel, wait, I can't let...
Actually, I kind of want to see what happens.
Hey. Hey.
Nice, uh, costume.
Oh, yeah.
Well, I wanted to give Emily a big American goodbye cheer.
So okay. Whoo!
Ready. Okay.
Give me an "E." GROUP: E.
Give me an "M." GROUP: M.
Give me an "I." GROUP: I.
Give me an "L." GROUP: L.
Give me a "Y." GROUP: Y.
What do you get?
Oh! Emily.
Whoo! Emily.
Okay. That's me as a cheerleader. Ta-da!
You all right? I just loosened a tooth.
It's no big deal. I have a dentist, you know?
I'm gonna go put some ice on it. Excuse me.
What do I do now? What do I do now? I think you're done.
Okay, time to take off the bra.
Uh, that was really great.
But I got to take off, actually.
Take the bra off.
All right, come on, let's go get your coat.
Okay.
Rachel's my girlfriend.
So this was really fun.
Oh, yeah, it was real fun.
You know, this bra...
...is really bothering me.
You know, this used to be my bedroom.
Yeah.
A lot of memories in here. Lot of memories.
If these walls could talk, you know what they'd say?
"Want to hear some memories?"
Need a...? Need a little hand there?
Oh, no, no, no. No, I got this all under control.
You really don't seem like you do.
God. Forget it! Oh, this is...
This is not how this was supposed to happen.
What was supposed to happen?
Can you not look at me when I say this?
I thought that if I could get you here...
...I could seduce you.
Uh, I don't wear suits to work...
...and I bought six of them from you.
Well, I'm sorry. I thought you needed them.
My point is, I kept coming back because I wanted to see you.
Why? Because I like you.
You like me?
Yeah.
I mean, you're beautiful and smart and sophisticated.
A lot of this isn't, you know, based on tonight.
But you like me?
Oh, my God. I can't believe this. All this time, I liked you and you liked me.
Oh!
But... No don't say "but."
"But" is never good. Let's leave it at "I like you and you like me."
Okay, uh...
However... No, that's a fancy "but."
My marriage, like, just ended.
And I'm really not ready to get into anything yet.
But...
I'm sorry. I just need a little time.
Okay.
Oh, there you are. I was looking for you before.
Joshua's gone, so you and Emily are free to go.
It's okay.
She's still in there enjoying her fake party.
And, uh, it's too late to do any of the stuff I had planned, so...
Ross.
I'm sorry. I completely ruined your evening.
Ahem. Yeah.
Well, if it makes you feel any better, I made a fool of myself.
Helps a little.
Is there a room on that step for a pathetic loser?
Yeah, have a seat.
I'm so sorry.
It's okay.
I mean, it was just a two-week thing anyway.
I just didn't want it to end this way, you know.
Or maybe you didn't want it to end?
What do you mean?
You seem to really like her.
Yeah, I really do.
Yeah, but what am I gonna do?
We both agreed it was gonna be a two-week thing.
You know? No commitment.
Ross?
That girl just spent the entire evening talking to your friends...
...asking to hear stories about you...
...looking through Monica's photo albums.
I mean, you don't do that if you're just in it for two weeks.
You think?
You've got, like, 14 hours until she has to be at the airport.
And you're sitting here in a hallway...
...with a 28-year-old cheerleader with a fat lip.
Hey, you're right. Yeah.
Thanks.
What photo album was it?
I don't know. It was you and a bunch of albino kids.
Oh, my God. Those weren't albino kids.
That was computer camp. Rach.
Hey. Hey.
You're a pathetic loser, right? Oh, yeah.
Sit.
Hi.
Oh, my God. Joshua.
Look.
All those things I said about not being ready...
They're not true? No, they're all true.
Oh.
But...
Oh.
Oh, I love that "but."
Um, do you want to go inside and get some coffee?
Yeah. Okay.
Every time.
Ooh, what do you got there? Pastrami.
Yeah.
Hey, you know what goes good with that? Mm-hm. Corned beef.
Ooh, I was going to say bologna. But that's better.
How about a little of that smoked turkey? Okay.
Oh, Mama.
When is the baby due? Six months.
Hey, now, if a cow should die of natural causes...
...I could have one of those, right?
Not if I get there first.
Oh, man.
What is that? Treeger's snaking the shower drain.
What in the name of hell?
Maybe he found your flip-flop.
Hey. Whoa.
Is this porn?
What did I do? I must have hit something on the remote.
Do we pay for this?
No, we didn't even pay our cable bill.
Maybe this is how they punish us.
Maybe we shouldn't pay our phone bill. Free phone sex.
Maybe we shouldn't pay our gas bill.
Whoa, hey, that lady's all kinds of naked.
Yeah, Joey just pressed something on the remote and it just came on.
It happened to me once. I was flipping through the channels and, bam.
It was like finding money. Finding money with naked people on it.
Then I made the mistake of turning off the TV.
I never got it back again.
And I'm sad.
Why would he turn off the TV?
Friends S04E17  The One With The Free Porn
All right, you know what? Do we really have to watch this while we eat?
No, no, no.
We don't know what could make this go away.
Yeah, so no one touches the remote, and no one touches the TV.
And no one touches the air around the TV.
Imagine a protective porn bubble, if you will.
I'm at least going to mute it. No, no, no.
We still have porn. Yeah.
Hi. Hey.
Honey, what are you doing?
That's too heavy. Give it here.Yeah.
Oh, God.
Okay.
I'm getting too pregnant for this... Lugging around a stupid massage table.
I have to find a job where I carry a smaller table.
Or a job where you don't have to carry a table.
You mean, like a doctor?
Pheebs, you're blocking the porn. Look out.
Oh, my.
Oh, that reminds me. I have to see my ob-gyn today.
Hi. Hi.
So, uh, Emily just went to the airport.
Aw. Why didn't you take her?
Ehh, her uncle had planned on doing it.
And you know, we said our goodbyes this morning, so...
You must feel horrible. Hey, the guys have free porn.
No.
Hey, cheer up. You're gonna see her again, right?
Well, that's the thing. I don't know.
I mean, whenever I brought it up with her, she said:
"This is so fantastic. Why do we have to talk about the future?
Let's enjoy..." Don't do the accent.
You've got to see her again.
Why do you care?
Because.
You could get to live out my fantasy.
You've had fantasies about Emily?
No. You know, the fantasy.
Meet someone from a strange land...
...fall madly in love and spend the rest of your lives together.
Is that why, in junior high...
...you were the only one who hung out with that Ukrainian kid?
Yeah, that, but plus his mom used to put sour cream on everything.
Do you love her?
We said it was only gonna be two weeks, you know?
You love her.
What is love, really?
I knew you loved her.
You need to go to the airport and tell her.
You're probably gonna catch her just as she's about to go to the gate.
You're gonna call out her name and yell, "I love you."
She's gonna say, "I love you too."
Then you guys are gonna have the most amazing kiss.
Everyone at the gate will applaud.
I am a good kisser.
Then you two can sneak into the cockpit.
Things will start to heat up.
And then a stewardess comes in...
I've been watching too much porn.
Is that the heartbeat? That's it.
Oh, my God.
Oh, wow. This is so cool.
Have we talked about the possibility of multiple births?
Why don't we just take care of this one?
And should I get pregnant again, I'll hold onto your card, okay?
No, I'm getting three separate heartbeats.
Three? You guys were worried I wouldn't even have one.
Doctors are wrong all the time. Well...
Well, so are you sure that there are three?
Definitely. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Ha, ha.
So in a few months...
...I'm gonna have three full-grown babies just walking around inside me?
Oh, oh. And it's gonna be like one of those log rides...
...when they just come shooting out.
Giving birth to three babies is not that different than giving birth to one.
What do you know?
Phoebe. Oh! Hi.
So how'd it go at the doctor's?
Oh, well, okay. Hey.
You know how, when you're, um, walking down the street...
...and you see three people in a row.
And you say "Oh, that's nice."
Yes. Okay.
Yeah, well, good news. You're gonna have three babies. Aah!
Three babies? Uh-huh.
Oh, oh!
I've finally got my band.
We're gonna have a big family! I always wanted a big family!
Oh, God. I'm so glad you guys are happy. I was so afraid you we're gonna be freaked.
Oh. Why would we be freaked?
No, because maybe it's harder to raise them and the added expense. Ugh!
Oh. Right.
No, back to happy. Back to happy!
No, no, no. It's gonna be fine...
...because, um...
Because I teach Home Ec.
And I can have 30 kids making baby clothes all year long.
You know, it'll be like my very own little sweatshop.
You know, I've been thinking
ever since you said that we're gonna have triplets.
The best thing for me to do is drop out of college and get a job.
Frank. No, you can't quit college. No.
You're in college? Really?
Yeah, refrigerator college. Yeah.
Yeah, you know, when we found out we were gonna have a baby...
...I figured, you know, I should have, like, a career, you know?
And I love refrigerators. Yeah.
You can't give up on your dream. Ugh.
No, it's okay. We're gonna have three kids.
And that's a different kind of dream.
Three kids and no money.
This is the boarding call for Flight 009.
Emily.
Oh, my God. What are you doing here?
I just... I had to see you one more time before you took off.
You are so sweet.
That's a big candy bar.
I had the most amazing time with you.
Me too.
This is the final boarding call for Flight 009.
Well, that's me.
Here, have this.
I'm only allowed one piece of carry-on anyway.
Wait, uh...
Listen, I have to tell you something.
I've been thinking.
I'm just going to come out and say it, okay? Uh...
I think
I love you.
Thank you.
It's no problem.
What is that song that has been in my head all day?
It's the theme from Good Will Humping.
You know who doesn't even like dirty movies?
My new boyfriend Joshua. Yeah, right.
No, he told me he prefers to leave certain things to the imagination.
Oh, oh, yeah. Did he also say that he thought some of the dialogue was corny?
And that he actually found it funny, not sexy?
Yes.
Yeah, he likes porn.
Where you going?
I'm gonna find out if he really thinks supermodels are too skinny.
Hey, Pheebs. Hi.
Hi. Hey. How'd it go with Frank and Alice?
Frank has to quit college...
...because his super-fertile sister is having three babies. Ugh.
I need to make a lot of money really fast.
And I had an idea that I wanted to talk to you about...
...because you work for a big company. Okay.
Insider trading.
What information is there that you can give me?
Well, actually, they don't really talk to us about that stuff.
I can get you some free White-Out, though.
Huh! Did you do what I said? Did you tell her?
I did. And what did she say?
"Thank you."
You're totally welcome. What'd she say?
She said, "Thank you."
I said, "I love you."
And she said, "Thank you."
Oh, wait. Did you say you love her?
Yeah, what were you trying to get her to do?
What do I do now?
You play hard-to-get.
She already lives in London.
So you go to Tokyo.
All right, look, forget it.
Okay, forget it. You told her you love her. It's over.
It is not over. You're over.
What?
You know.
Okay.
Good one.
It's not over because she's gonna call you and tell you she loves you.
The reason why she couldn't is because her feelings were so strong that it scared her.
Now, you go home and you wait for her call.
She could be calling you from the plane. Come on, go.
Okay, okay. But if she doesn't call, it is definitely over.
No, wait, wait. Unless, eventually, I call her, you know, to see what's going on...
...and she says she'll call me back, but then she doesn't.
Then it's over.
Way to be strong, man.
Hi. Hey.
Listen, can we watch cartoons on your television?
We need a porn break.
We spent the last two hours watching In and Out and In Again.
Well, so why don't you just turn it off?
Because then we'd be the guys who turned off free porn.
Oh, good, you're here.
Hey.
What you got there?
Oh, this? Well, I'm glad you asked.
Now, don't you hate it when you have to cut a tin can...
...with an ordinary steak knife?
Now, I know what you're thinking.
Pregnant woman slays four?
They didn't make you pay for those knives, did they?
No. Are you sure?
No.
You're not gonna make enough money to help Frank and Alice by selling knives.
No, no. I know that.
But I just need to make enough money for the second part of my plan.
What's the second part of your plan? My Saturn dealership.
Hello?
Ross?
Emily. Hi.
Uh, how was your flight?
It was dreadful.
Uh, I felt terrible about how I acted when you said those wonderful things.
No, no, that's all right. Um...
I'm just glad you called.
Ross, um, there's something that I've got to tell you.
There's someone else.
Does that mean the same thing in England as it does in America?
She doesn't know which one of us she wants.
Me or this "Colin" guy.
This isn't how it was supposed to go. I mean, there can't be another guy.
Well...
Of course there's another guy.
Heh. This is even more perfect.
Now you have to prove your love.
I'm not proving anything, okay? I'm done listening to you.
If I hadn't let you talk me into going to the airport in the first place...
...I wouldn't have put my fist through the wall.
You put your fist through the wall?
No, I missed and hit the door.
But it opened really hard.
You have to go to London. What?
Yep. You have to go fight for her.
Oh, yeah, sure. That makes sense.
Because you already told her you loved her, and she didn't say it back.
Then she called you and told you there was another guy.
So yeah. Go to London. That will scare her.
When Rachel was with Paolo, what did you do?
I made fun of his accent.
You sat back and let him have her. You didn't fight at all. Am I right?
You want the same thing to happen with Emily?
No. All right, then.
Go fight for her. Go to London.
I mean, that could be you and Emily.
That, but nicer.
Just go to London.
Really? Come on.
Surprise her. Show up at her doorstep. Don't let her go without a fight.
All right. All right. I'm going to do it. All right.
I'm gonna go to London, and I am gonna fight for her.
Okay. Good luck.
Ross, Ross. If you're going to the airport...
...can you pick me up another one of those Toblerone bars?
Oh, oh, I did it. I did it. I figured out a way to make money.
I'm gonna open up my own massage place and Frank's gonna help me.
And we can work it around his schedule, so he doesn't have to quit school.
La-la-la.
That sounds great. But how can you afford it?
We were walking down the street...
...and we saw that van you used for catering.
And we realized... I'm telling it. I'm telling it.
Okay, you know how people need transportation...
...but they also need massages to relax?
So I just figured we could combine the two. Okay, I give the massages and Frank drives.
I can fix up the van, bolt the table in the back and you know what I've got?
A place that no one will ever get out of alive?
No, think about it. It's a taxi that people take when they need to relax.
It's a Relaxi-Taxi.
The name was my favorite part.
Well, I came up with it. You did not!
No. You came up with Relaxi-Cab. That's not good.
Hello? Hey.
Oh, my God. Ross, are you in England? Was Emily surprised?
No, because she hasn't come home yet.
And she hasn't been home all night.
She's obviously staying with that other guy.
And I'm the stupid moron who spent the whole night outside her apartment.
All right, when is the next flight out?
About four hours.
Okay, just stay there a couple more hours. If she doesn't show up, come home.
Hey, tell him about Relaxi-Taxi.
And ask him if he thinks that is better than Relaxi-Cab.
It's not Relaxi-Cab. It's Relaxi-Cab. Like Taxi-Cab.
Ooh, that is better.
Are we in London?
Why are you doing here? You can't be here.
I've come to talk to Ross.
What?
Nothing. No, nothing.
I was gonna call him...
Oh, you came to tell him you love him. I knew it!
I was right! I'm right, right?
I'd really rather talk to him.
I've been to his apartment and he's not there.
And I need to talk to him.
So do you have any idea where he is?
Ross, are you there?
Ross, I don't know if you can hear this, but I'm gonna talk anyway.
I'm in the States with your sister and your friends.
And it's all over with Colin.
I came here to tell you that and to tell you...
Yes, Joey, you can have all the chocolate you want. Just take it.
I came here to tell you that I love you.
I love you too.
I'm gonna call you right now from the phone booth.
You can't hear me.
I wish I could know if you'd heard any of that.
I suppose I've either told you that I love you or given my neighbors a good laugh.
Mrs. Newman, if you're listening, bugger off. This is none of your business.
Suppose there's not much chance you did hear that.
And there's the call waiting
so I should go.
Oh, well.
Hello?
Hi.
Ross, I love you.
Thank you.
Hey. Hey.
I was just at the bank and there was this really hot teller.
And she didn't ask me to go do it with her in the vault.
Same kind of thing happened to me.
Woman pizza delivery guy comes over...
...gives me the pizza, takes the money and leaves.
What, no "Nice apartment, bet the bedrooms are huge"?
No, nothing.
You know what? We have to turn off the porn.
I think you're right.
All right, ready?
One. Two.
Three. Three.
That's kind of nice.
Yeah, that's kind of a relief. Yeah.
You want to see if we still have it? Yeah.
Free porn! We have free porn!
Hey. Hey. Wow, it is true what they say:
Pregnant bellies look like a drum.
Well, it's just I'm so pregnant that my guitar doesn't fit anymore.
So I thought, till I'm not, I'm gonna play my songs on this drum.
It sounds really cool.
Listen, listen. Ahem. Okay.
Smelly cat, smelly cat
What are they feeding you?
Wow, Pheebs, that sounds great.
I know, I know! And I've only been playing for, like, an hour.
Phoebe. Phoebe. Hi. Hey.
What are you doing here?
Um, actually I came down to ask you a big favor.
Oh, well, don't tell me you want to keep more of your stuff in my uterus.
No, no, no. Okay. Now, see. Ahem.
I want to name the girl baby Leslie.
And, um, Frank wants to name one of the boy babies...
...Frank Jr., Jr.
Wouldn't that be Frank III?
Don't get me started.
Anyway, um, since there are three babies...
...and, um, we both got to put our names in...
...we would be truly honored if you would name the other boy baby.
Oh, wow.
That's so nice. Oh, oh! Ha, ha.
Cougar.
You think about it.
Friends S04E18  The One With Rachel's New Dress
I left a bra drying on the shower rod.
You don't think your son will think it's yours and be traumatized?
Hey, Mommy can have a wife. Daddy can have a bra.
Oh, it's time to go.
Oh, no, no, no. See, that clock's a little fast.
Uh, we still have 17 minutes.
Huh. What can we do in 17 minutes...
...twice?
Well, that's ambitious.
Okay, you can ignore that. That's Carol with your son.
Uh, believe me, when he's older, he'll understand.
Ross. I'll be right there.
Hello. Hello. Hey. Hi.
Uh, Emily, this is Carol and Susan.
Hey, it's so nice to finally meet you. You too.
Susan's gonna be shooting a commercial in London next week.
I'm so excited. I've never been there.
Oh, well, I'll show you around. Great.
Also, I was hoping to catch a show. So if you can make any suggestions...
Oh, there's tons of terrific stuff.
I'll go with you. Oh.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Oh. Look at you two bonding.
Making us late for the airport so... Are you all right?
Oh, he's fine, he's fine. It's just us getting along is difficult for him...
...because he doesn't like me.
Ha, ha. Come on. That's...
It's true.
Hi. Hey. Hey, do we have a baby name yet?
Ugh, no. It's so hard.
I went through this whole book and found nothing.
I want a name that's really, like, you know, strong and confident.
You know? Like Exxon.
Well, it certainly worked for that Valdez kid.
Oh, oh, Pheebs. You want a strong name? How about The Hulk?
No, I'm not sure about Hulk...
...but I like the idea of a name starting with "The."
Well, you want a good name, heh, go with Joey.
Joey's your pal, Joey's your buddy.
Where is everybody? They're hanging out with Joey.
Know what? If you're gonna name him Joey...
...you should name him Chandler.
Oh, come on, Chandler's funny, he's sophisticated, and he's very lovable...
...once you get to know him.
Hey, Joey's lovable too.
But the thing about Joey is, if you need him, he'll be there.
Chandler will be there for you too. I mean, he might be a little late...
...but he'll be there. And he'll bring you some cold soda...
...if what you need him for is that you're really hot.
What do you say? What do you say?
Well, I like the idea of naming him after someone I love.
And Joey and Chandler are both great names.
All right, I don't...
Maybe I will just name him The Hulk.
I knew I shouldn't have mentioned it. That's what I wanted to name my kid.
Hey, Mon? If you were hoping to sleep with Joshua for the first time tonight...
...which one of these would you want to be wearing?
You know what? It really creeps me out choosing other people's sex clothes.
Sorry. I'm just so excited.
I've been waiting for this for months. I got my hair colored.
I got new sheets. I'm making him a very fancy meal.
What am I making him, by the way?
Well, you're making him a fris¨¦e salad with goat cheese and pine nuts...
...wild rice, roasted asparagus and salmon en croute.
I thought I was making him filet mignon.
Yeah, you were, but you decided to make salmon because you had some left over.
And then you realized if you bitched about it, then you would stop cooking...
...and you would have to make your famous baked potato and Diet Coke.
Wow, I really get crabby when I cook.
Hey. Hey.
Hey.
So, uh, Emily called last night.
And now you're giving me the message?
Turns out that Emily is just crazy about Susan.
Yeah. They're going to the theater together.
They're going to dinner.
They're going horseback riding.
God, Susan is so fun.
Look, this is just a little too familiar.
Okay, for, like, six months before Carol and I split up...
...all I heard was, "My friend Susan is so smart.
My friend Susan is so funny. My friend Susan is so great."
You actually think that something could happen between Emily and Susan?
Hey, they're going to the gym together.
Two women...
...stretching.
You know, they take a steam together, things get a little playful.
Didn't you see Personal Best?
No, but I'm gonna.
Hi. Hi. You're crazy.
Okay, this is Emily. Emily is straight.
How do you know?
I mean, we thought Carol was straight before I married her.
Yeah, definitely. I don't like the name Ross.
What a weird way to kick me when I'm down.
No, no, I just meant for the baby.
What's wrong with Ross?
It's just, you know, something like this...
...would never happen to The Hulk, you know.
Actually, that's not true.
In The Incredible Hulk, number 72, Dr. Bruce Banner found...
You know, never mind. My girlfriend's a lesbian.
So I decided I'm definitely gonna go with either Joey or Chandler.
Oh. oh, oh, oh.
You gotta pick Joey.
I mean, name one famous person named Chandler.
Raymond Chandler. Someone you didn't make up.
Okay, there are no famous Joeys. Except for, heh...
...Joey Buttafuoco.
Yeah, that guy really hurt us. Yeah.
Well, how about a compromise then? Okay, what if it's...
...you know, Chan-no-ey?
Okay, look, Joey? Come on, think about it. He'll never be president.
I mean, there's never gonna be a President Joey.
All right, look, I didn't want to bring this up.
But Chandler is the stupidest name I've heard in my life.
It's not even a name. It's barely even a word.
Okay, it's kind of like chandelier but it's not.
All right? It's a stupid, stupid, non-name.
You're right. I have a horrible, horrible name.
I'm sorry, man. I didn't... I'm sorry.
So I guess it's Joey, then. I mean...
This is so nice. Thank you for doing this.
Oh. Please. Cooking soothes me.
So dig in. All right.
Well, it all looks so good. Mm.
Oh, my God.
Oh, I know. My God, this rice is so...
I am so good.
Behind you.
Oh, yeah, sorry. They used to live here, and sometimes they migrate back over.
Is there, uh...? Is there some way that they could, uh, not be here?
It's just that, uh, farm birds really kind of freak me out.
Yeah. Okay, okay.
Here we go. Here we go. Whoa.
Whoa. Oh, sorry.
There you go.
Hey. How'd you do that?
Come on.
All gone. Heh.
So, farm birds, huh?
Yeah, it's my only weird thing, I swear.
And I would have told you about it but I didn't know that they'd be here.
So can I serve you a little...
What, what, what?
Nothing. Uh, it's just that I know that they're still out there.
They're across the hall. I mean, that's two doors away.
It's gonna take them a long time to peck their way back over here.
That's not funny.
Uh... Okay, you know...
Would you feel better if we went someplace else?
I mean, we could pack all this stuff up and, you know, go to your apartment.
Oh, they're working on it this week. It's a mess.
But, uh, I'm staying at my parents' house. We could go there.
Your parents'? They're out of town.
Oh.
It's a huge place, and it's got this gorgeous view of the park.
It'd be very, very romantic.
What do you say? Yeah, that works.
They can smell the fear.
Hey.
How's Ben?
Well, I asked him if he wanted to eat. He said no.
I asked him if he wanted to sleep. He said no.
I asked what he wanted to do. He said no.
So he's sweeping.
Hey, buddy. Hey.
So, um, any word from Susan?
Ooh, yeah, she said she's having so much fun with Emily.
Uh, by the by, did it ever occur to you that...
...I don't know, maybe they might be having a little too much fun?
What's too much fun?
You know, the kind of fun you and Susan had when we were married.
Oh, my God. You are so paranoid.
Am I? Yes.
Am I?
I can't speak for Emily...
...but Susan is in a loving, committed relationship.
Uh-huh. Carol, so were we.
All right, just imagine for a moment...
...that Susan meets someone, and they really hit it off.
Say they're coming back from the theater...
...and they stop at a pub for a couple of drinks.
They're laughing, you know.
Someone innocently touches someone else.
There's electricity.
It's new. It's exciting.
Are you telling me there isn't even the slightest possibility...
...of something happening?
Maybe. Oh, my God.
I didn't really believe it until you just said it.
None of the other kids believed me, I swear to God, that duck pushed me.
Wow. This place is fabulous.
Yeah, let me show you around. This is the downstairs living room.
There's two living rooms?
God, growing up here, this place must have been a real babe magnet.
Yeah, well, it would have been, but, uh, my parents just moved here.
Well, you should know this place is a real babe magnet.
Want to make out?
You know, here's an idea. Why don't I put the food in the fridge...
...and we can eat it later?
That sounds like a plan. Heh.
Um, is there a place that I could go freshen up?
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Um, just down the hall and, uh, second door to your left.
Oh, hi, darling. Mom, Dad, what are you guys doing here?
Oh, we cut the trip short. France sucks.
Um, this may be a little weird, but I've got a date here.
Say no more.
We'll just grab some food, take it with us upstairs and be out of your hair.
Oh, that'd be great. So you didn't even get to Italy?
Yep. Sucks.
Hi, you.
Oh, my God.
I know. I can do more than cook.
I like her. She seems smart.
Rachel, my parents.
So nice to meet you. Hello, hello.
Oh, Joshua, that $500 was for groceries.
What, this? Oh, no. That's not what it is.
Okay, I work in fashion.
See, and this is a real dress, actually.
They're wearing it in Milan.
So part of my job is to wear the clothes and then I see how people respond.
And then I report back to my superiors at Bloomingdale's, so...
And obviously, in this case...
...I am going to report back:
"U.S.A. Not ready."
Maybe in L.A. Yes.
There you go. So have you kids eaten yet?
Well, ahem, we were going to do that after. I mean, um...
Next. Well, we're starving.
Why don't we just all go get something to eat?
Yeah, well, ha, ha, no use wasting this baby just lying around the house.
So we'll go eat. Yeah.
You'll wear that.
We'll be eating and, of course, you'll be wearing that.
Dude, I am sorry about what I said.
Nope, nope, you're right. It is a ridiculous name.
It's not that bad. Yes, it is.
From now on, I have no first name.
So you're just Bing?
I have no name.
So, what are we supposed to call you?
Okay, uh, for now, temporarily, you can call me...
...Clint.
No way are you cool enough to pull off "Clint."
Okay, so, what name am I cool enough to pull off?
Um, Gene.
It's Clint. It's Clint.
See you later, Gene. Bye, Gene.
It's Clint. Clint!
What's up with Gene?
You wore your nightie to dinner? Oh, yeah.
And the best part though, was when the waiter spilled water down my back.
I jumped up and my boob popped out.
Oh, my God. Oh, no.
Yeah, it's all right. I got nice boobs.
So I just picked up a message from Emily.
She and Susan are going to a poetry reading together.
So? So?
Poetry?
Susan's gay.
They're being gay together.
Emily's straight. Oh, wake up.
Wow.
Carol really messed you up.
Excuse me?
She turned you into this untrusting, crazy, jealous sycophant.
All right, so I don't know what "sycophant" means, but the rest is right.
I don't know what you're talking about. I am not a crazy, jealous person.
What? She's totally right.
When we were together, you got all freaked out about Mark...
...and there was nothing going on. This makes sense.
It does not.
Sure it does. In high school, you weren't jealous at all...
...even though all your girlfriends were cheating on you.
All right, so up until '92, '93, he was very trusting.
Then '94 hit, Carol left him, and bam. Paranoid City.
Yeah.
Absolutely, absolutely.
This is so much fun.
This is not fun.
Look, all we're trying to say is...
...don't let what happened with Carol ruin what you've got with Emily.
The '92 Ross wouldn't.
I still think I was right about that whole Mark thing, though.
Wha...? Well, you know what? I hope Emily is a lesbian.
Drum roll.
Okay. Okay.
All right.
Help. Am I a Mark or a John?
Ehh, you're not tall enough to be a Mark.
But you might make a good Barney.
All right, look, I am serious.
Tomorrow at 3:30, I'm going to the courthouse.
You're actually going through with this?
Hey, look, this name has been holding me back my entire life.
Okay, it's probably why kids picked on me in school, and why I never do well with women.
So as of 4:00 tomorrow, I'm either gonna be Mark Johnson or John Markson.
You've got problems because of you, not your name.
This has got to stop. Chandler is a great name.
In fact...
Yes.
I'm sorry, I know you really wanted me to name the baby Joey.
But... So I'm gonna name the baby Chandler.
Really?
Yeah, but you have to keep the name too.
Okay, thanks. Okay.
You want to hug it out? Yeah.
Okay, I'm gonna go tell Frank and Alice right now.
Okay.
Bye, Pheebs. Okay, bye.
Flight 004 is now arriving at Gate 17.
Nice luggage. I was going to say.
Hey. Hi.
I missed you. Oh, I missed you too.
Thanks for everything, I had a great time.
Oh, so did I.
No tongue.
Morning's here
The morning's here
Sunshine is here
The sky is clear
The morning's here
Do you have to do that? It's Saturday!
Oh, come on!
Morning's here!
Morning's here
The morning's here
Sunshine is here
I hate this apartment!
I hate the color of these walls! I hate that this place still smells like bird!
I hate that singing guy!
Are you kidding? I love that guy!
Morning's here, morning is...
Stop it!
I will kill you.
I hate that my room is so small.
I have all the space I need. Just do what I did.
Monica, you don't even have a bed. You sleep in a ball on the floor!
You know what? I am tired of your bellyaching.
I've worked really hard at making this a nice place for us to live.
I know. I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry, okay?
See, This is a great apartment.
Shut up. This place is a hole.
Friends  S04E19  The One With All The Haste
Oh, blimey, I still can't believe you've got an earring!
I know, I know. Who am I? David Bowie?
He does that?
I don't know. Whatever. Ha, ha.
Well, I think it makes you look really dangerous.
Oh, I know. Ha-ha-ha.
You know what?
I never would've gotten this if it weren't for you.
No, really. When I'm with you, I'm like...
...this whole other guy. I love that guy!
I mean, I love you too. A lot.
But that guy!
I love that guy!
I love both of you. Ah, heh.
I wish I didn't have to go.
Then don't.
Stay here. Just don't go so soon to London,
Just one more day. Oh, Ross.
One more day. Please don't do this to me again.
You know I'd stay, but I've already missed so much work. They'll fire me.
So? Then you could stay as long as you want.
I wish I could.
Oh, no, don't... Don't... Don't start packing.
Come on.
I don't think you understand packing.
I don't want to leave it till the last minute.
Last time I packed in a rush, I left my knickers here.
Yeah, I know. I, uh, tried them on.
You didn't!
No, I didn't. I didn't want to be "that guy."
Hello.
Ho, ho, ho.
Excuse me? Your pants.
Oh, yeah! You like them?
I went to a used clothes store and got a bunch of maternity stuff.
These are so comfortable.
Uh, Pheebs, those are, uh, Santa pants.
What? Santa pants.
Santa Claus' pants.
Nuh-uh. They're maternity pants.
They even came with a list of baby names. See?
These names are good, and these are bad.
Hey! Hey.
Hey, Pheebs.
So, how are the elves?
I don't know. How are the, uh, you know?
Your clothes aren't funny.
Hey, guys, what should I wear to a Knicks game?
Uh, a T-shirt that says, "I Don't Belong Here"?
You have tickets?
Yeah, my mom got my dad's season tickets in the divorce, so she gave them to me.
Apparently, they're good seats.
Oh, my God! Those are almost on the floor!
Do you guys want these?
Yeah! Yeah, we do!
Well, you got them!
All right! Just give us our apartment back.
Whoa, I didn't see that coming.
Are you serious?
Come on. We know what these are worth.
Do you think we're stupid?
Not stupid. You're meaner than I thought.
What do you say? Forget it.
Okay? I'm not giving up my bachelor pad for some basketball seats!
Your "bachelor pad"?
Have you even had a girl here?
No.
But Joey has, and I usually talk to them in the morning time.
Yeah, you do.
Come on!
Yes,Gunther, can I get two cups of chino, please?
Good one.
Come on. Season tickets.
Season tickets! You know what that means?
Forget it. I'm not giving up the apartment.
Oh come—look,When I was a kid, my dad's company gave season tickets...
...to the Number 1 salesman every year. All right? My dad never won.
Of course, he wasn't in sales. But still, I never ever, ever forgot that!
Hey guys! Hey.
Oh, my God.
We don't make enough fun of you already?
Oh, yeah. Emily convinced me to do it.
You do know that Wham broke up?
I like it. And Emily likes it. And that's what counts.
So, uh, how are you guys doing?
Don't try and talk all normal with that thing in your ear.
Where's Emily?
Ugh, she's saying goodbye to her uncle.
Didn't she, like, just get here? Yeah! Yeah.
Easy, tiger.
I just hate this so much.
Every time I go pick her up at the airport, it's so great.
But I'm thinking, "I'll be right back in a couple of days, dropping her off."
So, what'll you do? There's nothing to do.
She lives there. I live here.
She'd have to move here.
She should move here.
What?
I can ask her to live with me. Are you serious?
Why not? I mean, why not? You've only known her six weeks!
I've got a carton of milk in my fridge I've had a longer relationship with.
Look, guys, when I'm with her, it's like...
Uh, she brings out this great side of me.
I mean, I love her, you know?
And I love the milk!
But I won't ask some British girl to move in with me.
Joey, you say things now.
Look, Ross. He's right. Emily's great.
She's great!
But this is too soon. You're only gonna scare her.
I don't wanna do that. No.
You don't want to wreck it. Don't go too fast.
No. You're right. I know, you're right.
I'm not going to do it.
Thanks guys. No problem.
Just remember to wake us up before you go-go.
It's too hard. Too hard!
All right, boys. Last chance for the tickets.
Otherwise, I give them to my new boyfriend, Joshua.
No, thank you.
Wait, wait. Come on, come on! Let's trade.
The timing's perfect! I just clogged the toilet!
Look, I want those basketball seats as much as you do! Okay, but we can't leave in the small apartment...
...after we've lived here! Ever read Flowers for Algernon?
Yes.
Ever read Sports Illustrated?
No, I didn't read yours!
We can go to the game tonight!
The only way I'll consider this...
...is if they offer more than just season seats.
It's the Knicks! Screw the Knicks.
I didn't mean that. I just meant...
...that the apartment is worth so much more.
And the Knicks rule all.
Yeah, the Knicks rule all!
Hey, so? Are you going to do it?
No. No. We're not gonna do that, y'know why? Because its not an even trade.
All right, look.
What if you could keep the apartment and the tickets?
Done!
Let me finish. I'm talking about a bet. Winner takes all.
Ooh, we could get nothing.
Or you can end up with everything. Oh, I like that.
What do you say?
No! Just do it!
Oh! Oh, I'm convinced!
Come on, man! You know I'd do it for you.
Because you're my best friend.
All right. But you can't use that again for a whole year.
I'm in.
This is so exciting! What are you going to bet?
Okay. Well, we should let Phoebe decide...
...because she's the only one who's impartial, and she's so pretty.
Okay. Ha, ha. Um...
Ooh, ooh. Oh, I have a game!
This is great! Okay. What's the game? What's the game?
Um, well, it doesn't have a name. No, okay. Phoebe Ball!
No, it doesn't have a name. Um...
Okay, Monica.
What is your favorite thing about trees?
They're green? Good! Good, five points!
All right, Joey...
Same question.
Oh! Heh. They're tall. Ooh, three points.
Both fine answers, but we were looking for leafy. Leafy.
That's not even a game.
Shut up. We're winning!
You want to finish this? We get a deck of cards.
High card wins. What do you say?
Let's do it! Oh, I have cards!
Oh, good. Yeah. Here.
No, these are the trick deck.
Okay. Here, yes.
Okay, you guys, uh, you pick first.
Okay. Okay?
Four. That's a low one!
Phoebe, you look. I can't do it.
What makes you think I can? That's okay.
Why are you screaming and hugging?
Because we won our apartment back!
What? Ace is high! Jack, queen, king, ace!
No! Ace is low! Ace, two, three, four!
I don't know.
Look it! Aah!
All right, come on, pick again! Okay.
Okay. Okay.
Come on, apartment! Come on, apartment!
Aah! I know queen is high!
Not as high as...
It worked! King!
We pick again! We pick again!
Why? I don't know.
Tickets, please. Ugh!
That's courtside, baby! Yeah, ha, ha.
Seriously, good game, though. Good game.
What are they so mad about? They got the apartment back.
No, they didn't.
Hey.
Packed while you were gone.
I left some knickers under your pillow.
Move in with me.
What?
Don't be scared. I-I know it sounds crazy and-and people will say it's too soon,...
...but just think. Think how great it would be.
I don't know.
Uh, oh, leaving London.
My whole family lives there... I know.
My job. You'll get a job here.
I mean, I'm always hearing about uh, them foreigners coming in here and stealing American jobs;
That could be you.
Yeah, but it's my whole life.
You come to England.
I can't. I would. I really would. But my son is here.
I can't leave him. Isn't—you don't think there's any way?
Oh, I don't think so.
I mean it would be different if it was way into the future...
...and we were getting married or something.
What?
Uh, no, right. I shouldn't have said "married."
Uh, please don't go freaky on me.
I didn't mean it. I didn't say it. I take it back.
No. Don't.
Why don't we?
Why don't we what?
Get married.
You are mad!
No, I'm not! It's perfect. It's better than you moving here.
It's us together forever, and that's what I want.
We've known each other six weeks! Yeah, I know.
So what? Who's to say? Does that mean we can't do it?
Look. I was with Carol for four years before we got married...
...and I wound up divorced from a pregnant lesbian.
I mean, this...
This makes sense for us.
Come on. Our first date, we ended up spending the whole weekend in Vermont.
I mean, last night I got my ear pierced. Me!
This feels right.
Doesn't it?
My parents are gonna be really mad.
Is that...? Are you saying "Yes"? Is that "Yes"?
Yes.
Yes! Yes?
We're getting married! Oh, my God!
Yes! Ha, ha. We're getting married!
Come here, come here.
Emily, will you marry me?
Yes.
Oh, it's a bit small.
Damn! I thought that'd be romantic as hell.
It was.
Those were, like, the best seats ever. Oh, yeah.
Hey, should we give these to the girls? Like a peace offering?
Oh yeah, that's very nice. Plus, y'know they were free and too small.
Oh, God.
Hey, you want a beer?
Whoa! I know!
Open up! Open up! Open up!
We'll discuss it in the morning.
What the hell is going on?
We took our apartment back!
I had nothing to do with it.
Okay, it was my idea. But I don't feel good about it.
We are switching back right now.
No, we're not. We're not leaving!
You'll have to. You both have jobs.
As soon as you do, we're switching back! There's nothing you can do to stop us.
Right, Joe?
I don't know.
What?
I don't want to move again, with...
I don't care! This is our apartment and they stole...
You stole!
Our apartment! We won it fair and square. Twice!
And I am getting it back right now! I'm getting it back right now!
All right.
We figured you might respond this way, so we have a backup offer.
Oh, no more offers. You can't offer anything to us!
Let us keep the apartment and... As a thank you...
...Rachel and I will kiss for one minute.
Totally worth it. That was one good minute.
Good night. Good night.
Men are such idiots. I know.
Can you believe something that stupid actually got us our apartment back?
That's so funny to think if you'd just done that right after the last contest,...
...no one would have had to move at all. Ha, ha.
Let's pretend that's not true. Yeah.
Okay. Scarf's done.
Come on. Come on, come on! Okay.
Hey! Hey.
What's going on?
Ross has some big thing to tell everyone.
Well, okay. It's, uh... Ahem.
Emily and I, we decided to, uh...
...to get married.
What? Oh, my God.
Oh, are you pregnant too?
No.
When did...? How did you...?
We just decided to go for it.
We know it's a bit hasty, but, uh...
...it just feels so right.
Um, I was just telling the guys...
Yeah, I heard.
I think it's great! Aah!
I'm so happy for you!
Well, yeah! Congratulations!
I can't believe you're getting married! Yeah.
Monica and Rachel made out.
Morning's here
The morning's here
Sunshine is here
The sky is clear
The morning's here
Hey, you're back! Hey!
Get into gear Breakfast is near
The dark of night has disappeared
I'll see you tomorrow morning! Okay!
Are you kidding me?
Joey?
Joey? Joey, Joey, Joey, Joey, Joey, Joey, Joey!
Joey. Joey. Joey.
Joey, Joey!
Yeah.
Oh. Oh, did-did-did I wake you?
Friends  S04E20  The One With All the Wedding Dresses
Gunther, could I get another cup of coffee? please?
So, uh, what do you do when you're not working here?
You don't need to fill these silences. Okay, thanks.
Chandler, that's your fourth cup of coffee.
Well, I am drinking lots of cups of coffee because I'm exhausted because Joey started snoring.
He's in a different room. He's really that loud?
Oh, you should hear me.
It's not something to be proud of. okay? You have to go to a sleep clinic!
Look, I told you, I'm not going to any clinic.
I don't have a problem. You're the one with the problem.
You should go to a "Quit-beinga-baby-and-leave-me-alone" clinic.
They don't have those. Yeah, they do.
Quit being a baby and leave me alone!
There, you just had your first class.
I used to go out with this guy that was a light sleeper.
And whenever I'd snore, he'd roll me over...
Oh, yeah.
He'd roll me over, and I'd stop snoring.
Next time you snore, I'm rolling you over!
I gotta do what I gotta do. You gotta do what you gotta do.
Hey, guys. Hey.
Oh, the Olympics!
Have you guys picked a date yet?
No. Not yet.
I still can not believe you're engaged.
Just 'cause its happening so fast; not 'cause you're such a loser.
Thanks. Uh, has anyone seen Rach?
Mm, she's upstairs not doing the dishes.
And I'll tell you, I'm not doing them this time.
I don't care if those dishes sit until they're covered...
I'll do them when I get home.
Yeah. Oh, hey.
Um, Emily found this wedding dress in London...
Already? Yeah, but it didn't fit.
Luckily, there's a store here with one left in her size.
But I'm the groom, I'm not supposed to see the dress…
I'll pick it up for you. Thank you.
She's got you running errands, picking up wedding dresses...
Ha-ha-ha. Wah-pah!
What's "wah-pah"?
You know. Whipped.
Wah-pah!
That's not whipped. Whipped is wh-tcssh!
That's what I did.
Wah-pah!
You can't do anything!
Hey, Mon.
I was just doing these dishes. Oh... Hey.
Hi. Do you, uh, have a minute?
Yeah, I was just about to take a break anyway.
So listen, uh...
...I know you and I haven't had a chance to talk...
...since, uh, Emily and I decided to get married.
And I was just wondering how you were.
Ahem. Oh.
If you were getting married, heh, I would feel kind of...
You know? Yeah, yeah.
It def... Uh, it definitely took me by surprise. But, you know...
...uh, I'm okay.
Yeah? Yeah.
I just wanted to check.
Oh, that's sweet. Thank you. Oh, ha, ha.
You're great. Hmm.
And I know someday this will happen for you too.
You just hang in there. Ahem.
"Hang in there"?
Oh, no, I didn't mean...
I mean maybe you didn't hear about a serious relationship called "me and Joshua"?
Oh, I thought you guys had just been on like four dates,
I didn't realize that had become anything.
Oh, yeah. Oh, no, it has become.
Yeah. Oh, no, those were four great dates.
Oh. Yeah? Oh, yeah.
I mean, and the connection! I mean, you know.
Emotionally, mentally. You know?
Physically.
Wow. That's incredible. I know, isn't it?
I'm right there with Joshua. You are right there with Emily.
And it's y'know, it's kind of like it's a tie.
Well, I gotta get, I gotta get back to the dishes.
I gotta get to work. Oh, yeah.
Hey, y'know, y'know make me really happy?
Oh, yeah, no, what's that?
If like the four of us could all y'know, hang out together.
Uh, in fact Emily's coming into town this weekend.
why don't you say we all have dinner? Say, Sunday night?
That would be great! Yeah?
All right. It's a date! Yeah.
"Hang in there." You hang in there.
Did you say something? No, just singing.
Oh, my God!
Oh, look at this one!
It's so beautiful. Yeah. Oof.
Yeah, but y'know, about half of these will end up getting divorced.
May I help you ladies?
Oh, yes, umm, I'm here to pick up a dress that you have on hold
Yes, what's the name, please?
Emily Waltham. Oh, yes, I have it right here.
Would you like to try it on, Miss Waltham?
Okay.
You're the most beautiful bride I've ever seen.
I am, aren't I?
Miss Waltham?
Yes? We're closing.
All right.
And could I get my ring back?
All right, buddy. Time to roll over.
No, no! No, no, no, no, no!
You are going to a clinic! You're going to a clinic!
And a pajama store!
Does she use the cups?
Yes, I believe she does.
Does she use the plates? Yes, I believe she does!
Thank you. Heh.
Thank you very much.
Oh, thank you for coming.
Uh, just a second. No, no! Let me in!
Phoebe? Yeah?
Can you just hold on for one minute? No!
You have to let me in right now!
Are you alone? Yes!
All right.
This sucks.
I have to stay up all night before I go to the stupid clinic.
I'm so tired.
It's 6:00.
Hi. Hey.
I hear you and Joshua are going out with Ross and Emily.
And I think... I think that's really cool.
Yeah, I think you're handling that really well.
"Handling it"
What do you mean? There's nothing to handle.
Maybe I would have a problem with this if it wasn't for me and Joshua.
Y'know, They're not gonna get married anyway. What?
Come on. They rushed into this thing so fast, it's ridiculous!
They'll be engaged for like what? A year?
And somewhere along the way, one of them is gonna realize what they've done...
...and call the thing off.
I'm telling you, you'll be dancing at my wedding before you dance at theirs.
You know, I don't dance at weddings.
Why not? Because weddings are a great place to meet women.
When I dance, I look like this.
Hey, man. Hey.
So, what are you guys doing four weeks from today?
Nothing. Nothing.
I am...
...free.
Great, Because Emily and I are getting married in a month!
What? Yup.
In a month? Yeah.
You mean 30 days? Yeah.
From now? Yeah.
That's great! Yeah, ha, ha.
Emily always wanted to get married in this beautiful place that her parents got married ...
...but it's gonna be torn down, so...
I know it's crazy, but everything up 'til now has been so crazy,...
...and I don't know, just feels right, you know?
Hey, that's the day after I start menstruating!
This isn't mine.
Ahem Hey, Rachel.
Hi.
What's up? Oh, heh.
Your voice sounded all squeaky on the phone.
Oh, nothing. I just wanted to see you.
See you and hug you.
Ha, ha. See you, heh.
Great. Yeah!
Sit.
You okay?
I'm more than okay. I am really, really happy.
Want to know why?
Do I?
Because I am really happy about us.
I think we are, I think we are so on the right track.
Y'know? I mean, I think we are working. I think we are clicking.
You know? Yeah, sure, sure.
We're... We're clicking. Yeah.
If there was just one little area...
...where I think we need to work on, I would think...
...it's that we're just not crazy enough.
I got to say, I'm not too sure I agree with that.
Well, yeah. You know, yeah, you're right.
I mean, we have our fun. Yeah?
But, uh...
We ju... I mean like craaaazy! You know?
Okay. All right.
This is gonna, this is gonna to sound, you know, a little, um, hasty.
But, uh, just go with me.
What if we got married?
What? Oh, I know. It's so totally like:
"Whoa, can we do this?" You know? I mean...
But it just feels right. Don't you think? It does.
I mean, it just feels right. Don't you...?
Rachel, um...
you're
a real
special lady.
But my divorce isn't final yet
and, and, and we've been on four dates.
So I'm thinking  no...
but
thanks.
You idiot!
Your name, please? Joey Tribbiani.
Mm-hm. and did you stay up all night in preparation for your sleep study.
Uh, sir?
Yes, he did.
All right. We'll call you in a few minutes.
Whoa. Hey.
Check out that girl. She is really hot.
Yeah, she is.
How you doing?
What? You're coming on to the entire room.
I'm Chandler. Hi. I'm Marjorie. Hi.
Do you mind if I sit? No, please.
So, uh, what are you in for?
I talk in my sleep.
What a coincidence. I listen in my sleep.
So why don't you give me your number?
Are you ready? Okay. Yeah.
I got it! Mine! Aah!
Congratulations! Thank you! Ha-ha-ha.
Okay, my turn, my turn! Okay!
Okay, ready?
Okay.
That was a terrible throw!
I won't throw it right to you. That's not real.
Look at me. My big concern is what's real?
Oh, my God.
We're really sad, aren't we?
Yeah, I think we are.
This isn't even my dress.
At least you didn't rent yours from a store called "It's Not Too Late."
I'm changing out of this. Me too.
In, like, a half an hour? Me too.
All right, now throw it straight this time. Okay.
I'm getting married next! Yay!
I hate my regular clothes now.
You know? I look down and I know...
...this isn't gonna be the most special day of my life.
Yeah. I mean, it was kind of fun for a while...
...but didn't you feel kind of silly?
I guess.
Oh, my God!
Oh, you're such a cheater!
Hello, little ones.
Hey. Hey.
So is Joey going to stop snoring? Yep!
And a beautiful woman agreed to go out with me.
Joey wanted to ask her out, but, uh, you know, she picked me.
How'd that happen?
Because I'm cooler.
No, seriously.
She's the kind of girl... Joey was unconscious.
Hey, you guys! What's happening?
Oh, my God.
What is that? Oh! They gave it to me at the sleep clinic.
And it's going to help me not to snore.
Well, are you asleep right now, Joe?
'Cause I don't think you have to wear it unless you are!
I know I don't have to.
It tastes good.
Plus, you look cool.
Well, I just called Joshua.
Oh, how'd it go?
I did my best to convince him that I'm not...
...some crazy girl who is dying to get married.
And I'm going through a hard time. What'd he say?
Well, uh, his answering machine was very understanding.
I feel blue. Ugh.
Aw. Sweety.
I bet you anything he'll call you again.
Yeah, maybe. But, you know, I don't think I even care.
I don't think he's the one I'm sad about.
I know I said I'm totally okay with Ross getting married.
But as it turns out...
...I don't think I'm handling it all that well.
Yeah, maybe.
And I'm just trying to figure out why.
Any luck?
Well, yeah. You know how Ross and I have always been...
...on-again, off-again, on-again, off-again?
I guess I just figured, somewhere down the road...
...we would be on-again.
Again.
You know what? I think we all did.
Hey. Hey.
Hey.
I got us reservations for Sunday night.
How about Ernie's at 9:00?
Yeah, well, you, uh, better make it for three.
See, I don't know if we're going to be hungry at 3:00.
Three people.
Joshua's not going to be there.
What happened? Um, well, I think he broke up with me.
No. Why?
Apparently, he scares easy.
Rachel, I'm sorry.
Eh, it's okay.
Sometimes things don't work out the way you thought they would.
Come here.
Oh, hey, don't you have to go pick up Emily?
Yeah. Yeah.
Are you okay? Yeah.
I got my girls.
Okay.
Hey, you know what might cheer you up?
What?
I got to tell you...
...this really does put me in a better mood.
Ah, I wish there was a job where I could wear this all the time.
Maybe someday there will be.
Oh, God, that's Chandler coming by to borrow candles for his big date.
No, Rachel, don't get it! He'll see us!
No, yeah! The groom cannot see the bride.
I'm not going to marry Chandler.
Not after this!
Okay guys, just relax.
I do!
I gotta go. Wait, Joshua!
Yeah, well, that ought to do it.
Food's here. Fair enough.
Fifteen-minute warning.
Late.
Dude, I am trying to sleep!
It seems like all of a sudden, so much is happening.
I know. Ross is getting married.
Phoebe's making people.
Everybody's doing stuff. We just sit here.
If I died, the only way people would know I was here...
...would be by the ass print on this chair.
Look, we have to do something. Okay? Something huge.
We could climb Mount Everest.
No, no. Not something stupid. Something huge.
No, no, no. I saw an ad for this video.
People climb that thing every day. We could totally do that.
Why not? I mean, it's just climbing.
It's just steep.
Yeah.
We're going to Everest. Okay? It'd be nice to leave an ass print on Everest.
Hey. Hey.
What's up? We're gonna climb Mount Everest.
Yeah, baby. Really?
I looked into that.
Yeah, but, I mean, it costs like $60,000, and, you know, you could die. And...
And you would die.
Oh, well.
We could get that Everest video.
Yeah, we could do that without, you know, risking our lives at all.
While we're down at the video store, we could rent Die Hard.
Oh. You know what? I just remembered.
That Everest thing is only available through mail order.
Oh, well.
So you guys will stay here and hang out with me?
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
But I'll tell you something. one of these days...
...we're gonna get off our butts and rent Die Hard again.
Yeah, we are.
Friends  S04E21  The One With The Invitation
So, what did we decide? Does your uncle Nathan get an invite or not?
Oh, God. Nobody likes him.
And he's so cheap. He'd never fly to London in a million years.
Yeah, invite him.
Hey, did I do these neat enough?
Yeah, they're fine. Yeah?
If anyone asks, we'll say that Ben addressed them.
Oh. So you invited Rachel then?
Sure, why not?
Really? Yeah.
Well, I don't think I'd be comfortable having any of my old lovers there.
Wait, wait, wait. Do you think we shouldn't invite her?
Oh, no, no, Ross, you know I absolutely adore Rachel.
It's just that, well, I thought it might be a bit awkward for you.
But it's absolutely your decision.
More tea? Yeah, sure.
Earl Grey? Huh?
Fine, yeah, invite whoever you want.
I don't want to be single, okay? I just want to be married again.
And I just want a million dollars.
Rachel?
Oh, God, Monica. Hi. Thank God. Hi.
Okay. Everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor.
This is everybody. This is Chandler and Phoebe...
...and Joey.
Do you remember my brother, Ross? Sure.
Hey. Oh, God. Hi.
You know, back in high school...
...I had a, um, major crush on you.
I knew. You did? Oh, okay.
I always figured you just thought I was Monica's geeky brother.
I did. Oh.
Listen, do you think...?
And try not to let my intense vulnerability become any kind of a factor here
but do you think it would be okay if I asked you out sometime maybe?
Yeah.
Maybe.
Okay.
Okay, maybe I will.
See, I see, uh...
...big passion in your future.
Really? I do.
Oh, Ross, you're so great. Aw...
It's never gonna happen.
Okay, I have a question.
Well, uh, actually, it's not so much a question...
...as more of a general wondering...
...ment.
Okay. Okay.
Um, well, for a while now, I've been wanting to, um...
Oh... Yes. Yes. That's...
Look at that little kitty. That's right.
What? That little kitty.
Listen, missy, if you want this cart, you're gonna have to take me with it.
Yes.
Did you see that? You were incredible.
A brand-new woman, ladies and gentlemen.
Thank you. I could not have done this without you.
Okay, um... Uh...
More clothes in the dryer?
I'm fine. I'm fine.
You had no right to tell me you ever had feelings for me.
What? I was doing great with Julie...
...before I found out about you.
I was doing great before I found out about you.
You think it's easy for me to see you with Julie?
Well, the point is I don't need this right now.
Okay? It's too late.
I'm with somebody else. I'm happy. This ship has sailed.
All right, fine. Go ahead and do that, all right, Ross?
I don't need your stupid ship.
Good. Good.
Ross do you realize this is the first time in my life I'm doing something I actually care about?
This is the first time in my life I'm doing something that I'm actually good at.
I mean. If you don't get that...
I get that. I get that bigtime. And I'm happy for you...
...but I'm tired of having a relationship with your answering machine.Okay,
I don't know what to do anymore. Well, neither do I.
Is this about Mark?
Oh, my God. Okay, it's not.
Oh, my God.
I cannot keep having this same fight over and over again, Ross.
No. You're making this too hard.
I'm making this too hard? What do you want me to do?
I don't know. I don't know. Look, maybe we should just take a break.
You're right. Let's take a break. Let's cool off, okay?
Let's get some frozen yogurt or something.
No.
A break from us.
Why we're rushing? You know the girlfriend I told you about last night?
It turns out that she, uh, wants to get back together with me.
Oh, I found it!
That's so great for you guys. Yeah.
Good luck with your girlfriend. Oh, thank you... Ah, hey.
Rachel!
You got my message? You are right on time.
So, what do you say? Can I be your girlfriend again?
Yes, you can very much.
I want you to leave. Get outta here! No. No.
I wanna stay. I wanna talk about this.
Okay! All right. How was she?
What? Was she good?
Don't answer that.
You said you wanted to talk about it. Let's talk about it. How was she?
She was...
Awful. She was not good, not good.
Nothing compared to you.
She was different.
Good different?
Nobody likes change.
Oh! Just stop.
The way you owned up to everything...
...it just showed me how much you've grown, you know?
I mean, my mom never thought this would work out.
She was all, "Once a cheater, always a cheater."
I just wish we hadn't lost those four months.
But if time was what you needed just to gain a little perspective...
We were on a break!
You seem to really like her.
Yeah, but what am I gonna do? We both agreed that it was gonna be a two-week thing,
You know? No commitment.
Ross, that girl just spent the entire evening talking to your friends...
...asking to hear stories about you...
...looking through Monica's photo albums.
I mean, you don't do that if you're just in it for two weeks.
You think? Heh.
You've got like 14 hours until she has to be at the airport.
And you're sitting here in a hallway...
...with a 28-year-old cheerleader with a fat lip.
Yeah, you're right. Yeah.
Oh, this is so amazing.
I can't believe my brother's getting married, and in London.
It's so romantic.
Hey, pretty smart.
Tissue paper.
You're at the wedding. You have to cry.
Handkerchief? No, I got my invitation.
Oh, look, isn't this adorable?
Ross let Ben address mine.
Hello. Hey.
Hey. Hey.
Hey, did you get your invitation to Ross' wedding?
No.
Don't worry, man, I get to bring a guest. We'll show him.
I'm so jealous you're all going.
I can't believe I never knew you can't fly in your third trimester.
I never knew that. I didn't, either.
I knew that.
So didn't know that. But you should see your faces.
Hi, guys. What's up?
We're hanging out.
What's this? Is this Ross' wedding invitation?
Maybe that's the one we should have actually hidden.
Oh, no. No, you guys, come on. You don't have to do that.
I'm happy for him.
I am. I really... I'm... I'm ha...
I'll work on it.
I'm sorry, honey.
Rach, you're going to come though, aren't you?
Oh, honey, I don't know. I...
This isn't one of those "If she doesn't come, we don't come"?
Because I already bought my ticket...
You know what would be real weird? If you weren't there.
Just say you'll think about it, okay? No, I'll think about it. Yeah.
Who's this from? That's Ross'.
Oh, my God.
He remembered.
Remembered what?
It was like months ago. We were walking by this antique store.
I saw this pin, and I told him it was just like one my grandmother had...
...when I was a little girl. Oh.
I can't believe he remembered.
This must have cost him a fortune.
I can't believe he did this.
Ross? Remember back in college when he fell in love with Carol...
...and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck?
What did you just say?
Oh, my God.
Flight number 457 from Beijing now arriving.
Oh, my God.
Well, Ross and I were in grad school together.We haven't seen each other since then.
Well, I land in China. Guess who's in charge of the dig?
Julie!
Julie! Isn't that great?
Isn't that just kick-you-in-the-crotch, spit-on-your-neck fantastic?
Oh, that is so sweet.
No... Heh.
No... Okay. No, you hang up.
No, you... Okay. Okay.
One, two, three.
Well you didn't hang up either
She didn't hang up either.
Okay, no.
No, you hang up.
You. You. Y...
Ross, hi.
It's Rachel.
I'm just calling to say that, um, everything's fine.
And I'm really happy for you...
...and your cat.
So obviously, I am over you.
I am over you.
And that, my friend, is what they call closure.
Rach, I got a message from you.
Oh, my God, no. Hang up the phone. Give me the phone.
Give me the phone, give me the phone. Give me the phone!
You're over me?
Oh, God.
What...? You're, uh? Oh, God.
You're over me?
When were you...
...under me?
Basically, ahem...
...lately, I've, uh...
Ahem. I've uh, sort of had feelings for you.
Okay, I need to lie down.
He broke up with Julie.
Well, go hug her, for God's sakes.
Really? Really.
It's always been you, Rach.
Oh, God.
Oh...
Listen, I'm sorry I had to work tonight.
Oh, that's okay.
You're worth the wait. Oh.
And I don't just mean tonight.
Oh, God!
Oh. Honey.
Oh, that's okay.
Oh, no, you just rolled over the juice box.
Gunther, please tell me you didn't say anything to Rachel...
...about me and the girl from the copy place.
I'm sorry.
Was I not supposed to?
You're the one who ended it.
Yeah, because I was mad at you. Not because I stopped loving you.
You still love me?
No.
What does this mean? What do you...? I mean, do you want to get back together?
No. Maybe.
I don't... I don't know. What?
I just... I feel...
I can't believe I even thought of getting back together with you. We are so over.
Fine by me!
And, hey, just so you know, it's not that common...
...it doesn't happen to every guy, and it is a big deal!
I knew it!
Rachel's coming up. Doesn't she look pretty, Jack?
Oh, my God.
You know what this is, This is us getting ready for the prom. Oh!
You know what? We don't have to watch this.
Yeah, we do.Come on.
Get a shot of Monica.
Wait, how do you zoom out?
There she is.
Shut up. The camera adds 10 pounds.
Huh, so how many cameras are actually on you?
Dad, turn it off.
It is off. Yeah.
Right, Ross?
Looking good, Mr. Kotter.
I can't go to my own prom without a date. I can't. It's too late.
If you're not going, then I don't wanna go either.
I have a wonderful idea.
You should take Rachel to the prom.
We've seen enough. Let's turn it off.
I want to see. Fine, I'm not going to watch, all right?
Come on, kid. Let's go.
Are you handsome.
Let's show them.
Okay, Dad. Rachel, ready or not.
Here comes your knight in shining...
Bye. Don't wait up. Okay, Chip, let's go.
Oh, dear.
Jack, how do I turn this off?
I can't believe you did that.
Yeah, well...
See? He's her lobster.
No.
You're really not going? Yeah.
It's just going to be too hard.
You know, I mean...
...it's Ross.
How can I watch him get married?
You know? It's just for the best, you know? It is.
Plus somebody's got to stay here with Phoebe.
She's going to be pretty big by then...
...and she'll need someone to help her tie her shoes.
Drive her to the hospital in case she goes into labor.
You don't have a car.
And your license expired.
Yeah. See, there's so much to do, and I have so little time to do it in.
All right, check it out. Check this out.
It says there's a place you can go to rent videos of all the museums.
"It's almost as good as being there."
It's better. You can't go to a museum in your underwear.
Well, you could, but probably just the one time.
I bet we could get videos of all the sights...
...get a VCR in our hotel room, we'd never even have to go outside.
If we do that, we've got to rent Die Hard.
Oh-ho, I bet the British version is good.
That's like the 10th time I've peed since I've been here.
It's also, like, the 10th time you've told us. Ha, ha.
Yeah, oh, I'm sorry, it must be hard to hear.
I'll tell you, it's a lot easier having three babies playing...
...Bringing in the Noise, Bringing in da Funk on your bladder!
I am so sick of being pregnant.
The only happiness I get is from a cup of coffee...
...which of course is decaf because, oh, I'm pregnant. Heh.
Pheebs, you want a cookie?
Thank you so much.
So, uh, Pheebs, honey, how are those mood swings coming?
I haven't really had any yet.
Friends  S04E22  The One With The Worst Best Man Ever
Hey, guys. Hey.
All right. Here's the ring.
Yes, yes. A thousand times, yes.
So, uh, any ideas for the bachelor party?
Before you start handing out rings and planning bachelor parties...
...don't you have to decide who your best man's gonna be?
Oh, it's awkward. It's awkward, it's awkward.
I sort of already asked Chandler.
What? He got to do it at your first wedding.
Joey, I figured you'd understand. I've known him a lot longer.
Come on, Ross. I don't have any brothers. I'm never gonna get to be a best man.
You can be the best man when I get married.
I'm never gonna get to be a best man.
Wait, wait.
So you get to be my best man twice, and I don't get to be yours at all?
Oh, no. Yeah, of course, you can be my best man.
What about me? You just said I could.
I'm not even getting married!
Okay, this is a question for science-fiction writers.
I can't believe you're not picking me.
Hey, how could it not be me? I'm not even...
I'm not even... All right, you know what? That's it.
From now on, Joey I want you to be my best man.
Yes. Shame about you, though.
Stop it. What?
One of the babies is kicking.
I thought that was a good thing. It's not kicking me.
It's kicking one of the other babies.
Oh. Don't make me come in there!
Hey. Hey.
Do you guys have, like, a big bowl I can borrow?
Yeah, there's one right under the cabinet.
Thanks. Why do you need it?
Oh, we're having a party tomorrow night. Later.
Hey, hey. Are you planning on inviting us?
No. No, no. Later.
Hey, get your ass back here, Tribbiani!
Hormones.
What Phoebe meant was...
...how come you're having a party and we're not invited?
Oh. It's Ross' bachelor party.
So? Are you bachelors?
No. Are you strippers?
No. Then you're not invited.
All right, fine. You're not invited to the party that we're gonna have either.
Oh, what party?
Well, um...
The baby shower for Phoebe.
Baby shower?
Wow. That so doesn't sound like something I want to do. Later.
I can't believe I'm going to have a party!
Ha, ha. That's so great. A party!
Yay! Ha, ha.
I don't know why. Oh.
This is what I got going for the party so far liquor-wise.
Get a lot of liquor. Great. Great.
Okay, now, uh, in terms of the invite list, obviously I got you, me and Chandler.
And I'm invite Gunther because, well, we've been talking pretty loud.
I'll be there.
Oh, listen. I know it's your party...
...but I'd really like to limit the number of museum geeks that are gonna be there.
Yeah. Tell you what. Let's not invite any anthropologists, okay?
Just the dinosaur dudes.
Okay, we'll need a six-pack of Zima.
Hey, guys, what are you doing?
Oh, just planning my bachelor party with my best man.
Yeah, well, good luck trying to top the last one.
I don't think it's gonna be that difficult, considering this one won't take place...
...in the basement of a Pizza Hut. Heh.
Oh, I'm Ross, I'm Ross.
I'm too good for the Hut. I'm too good for the Hut.
Look, I gotta go pick up Ben. Uh, everything so far sounds great, Joey.
Just remember, keep it on the mellow side, okay?
Just a couple guys hanging out playing poker.
No strippers or anything, okay? You got it.
Okay, see you later. Yeah.
Ha, ha. Have fun planning your mellow party.
There's gonna be strippers there.
He didn't say anything about no strippers.
He just said, "No strippers." Oh. I chose not to hear that.
Look what I got, look what I got, look what I got.
Can you believe they made these for little people?
Aw. Little Village People.
Aw, okay. Look at this one. This is my favorite.
Oh, that is so sweet.
Phoebe's gonna love dressing them in these.
Huh. Except, uh, Phoebe's not gonna be the one who gets to dress them.
I guess she's not gonna get to keep the babies.
Oh, my God, we are throwing the most depressing baby shower ever!
Wait a minute. Unless we give her all gifts that she can use...
...after she's done being pregnant. Like, um, regular coffee. Tequila.
Oh, and somebody can get her those leather pants she's always wanted.
Oh, she's gonna love that.
What the hell is this?
What, did you actually thought it'd make me feel better?
To give me something I can't even use for another two months?
This sucks! Oh!
All right, what's my next present?
I don't have anything.
Hey, listen, man, about the stripper...
Yeah? Good call.
A little announcement. A little announcement.
I've decided that my best man is my best friend Gunther.
What's my last name?
Central Perk?
Thanks for not marrying Rachel.
Oh-whoa-wait, Gunther. Don't forget your shirt.
Hey. Hey, what are those?
Little party favors. Check it out.
"Ross Geller, Bachelor Bash 1998"
"Best Man Joey Tribbiani"
Okay, little announcement.
I just want everybody to know the position of my best man is still open.
And, uh, you know, so is the position of the bride.
Great.
Smooth, man. Yeah. You got some chili on your neck.
Well, I just want to say thanks, everyone. This was great.
Okay? And hey, I'll see you guys Monday morning.
Thanks, Joey. Oh, hey. Don't forget your shirt.
Oh, thanks.
Ahem. Okay. Hey, museum geeks. Party's over.
Okay, wave bye-bye to the nice lady. There you go.
Back to your parents' basement. All right.
Come on, boys, come on out. Here you go.
Oh. Look at the birdies.
Are those yours? Yeah.
Wow, I didn't know they let you keep chickens and ducks as pets?
Oh, yeah, yeah. And I got the duck totally trained too.
Watch this. Stare at the wall.
Hardly move.
Be white.
You are really good at that.
Oh. So I had fun tonight.
You throw one hell of a party.
Thanks, thanks. Yeah, it was great meeting you.
And listen, if any of my friends ever get married or have a birthday or a Tuesday...
Yeah, that'd be great. Okay. Ha, ha.
So, I guess, um, good night.
Oh, unless you, uh... Unless you want to hang around.
Yeah? Yeah. I'll let you play with my duck.
Hey...
Stripper.
The stripper stole the ring!
Chandler, get up, get up! The stripper stole the ring!
What? The ring is gone!
Oh. Okay, just, like, give me a minute to wake up for this.
You lost the ring. You're the worst best man ever.
Dude, this isn't funny. What am I gonna do?
I go to sleep last night, everything's cool.
I wake up this morning, the stripper's gone, and the ring is gone!
You slept with the stripper? Of course!
Hi, guys.
Hi, Phoebe.
Ahem. I wanted to apologize if I, you know, seemed a tad edgy yesterday...
...at my shower.
You know, it's just the hormones. You know?
No, we... Hormones. Yeah. Hormones.
Anyway, I just wanted to say thank you. It was just... It was so sweet.
Oh, okay. So sweet.
Yeah. Wow, you seem to be doing much better.
That's great. How are things going? Good.
No, but... Okay, it feels like everything's been about me lately.
So, what's happening with you?
Oh. Well, actually, we were just talking about me not going to Ross' wedding.
Oh. It just might be too hard...
...given the history and all that.
Wow, this reminds me of the time when I was, um, living on the street.
And this guy offered to buy me food if I slept with him.
Well, how is this like that?
Well, let's see. It's not really like that.
Because, you see, that was an actual problem.
And, uh, yours is just, like, a bunch of high-school crap...
...that nobody really gives... Yeah.
Well, I'm sorry. I just thought...
All right, here come the waterworks.
Oh. I don't know what I'm gonna do.
I called the company that sent her, and they don't care.
And I called 911 and they yelled at me.
If this isn't an emergency, then what is?
Hey, guys. Hey.
I just wanted to thank you for last night. What a great party.
And the guys from work had a blast.
You know, one of them had never been to a bachelor party before.
Yeah, and another one had never been to a party before, so...
So, uh, hey, that wedding ring, huh?
Man, that is nice. Yeah. Yeah, right?
Yeah, I was thinking I might pick one of those babies up for myself.
Where might one get one of those?
That ring, when my grandmother first came to this country...
...that ring and the clothes on her back were all she had with her.
So you might say that the ring is irreplaceable.
Oh, absolutely. It's been in my family for generations.
And every bride who's worn it has lived a long and happy life.
So you might say it's a magic ring.
Yeah, the stripper stole it.
My ring? My wedding ring?
The stripper stole my wedding ring?
How? How could this happen?
Well, I think it all started when you said, "Hey, Joey, why don't you be my best man."
All right, all right. Fine. I'm gonna call the cops.
Dude, I screwed up. You don't have to turn me in.
Not on you, on the stripper. Oh, yeah, well, I already did that.
They said they're gonna look into it right after they solve all the murders...
Okay, we'll call the company that sent her.
I did that too.
They wouldn't give me her name or number.
They said if I bother them again, they'd call the police.
I said, "You talk to the police, you tell them I'm missing a ring."
So, what, Joey? What are you telling me? That there's nothing we can do?
How could this happen? Look, Ross, I am so, so sorry.
Well, what if we just, uh, called her...
...used a fake name and had her come to my office?
Oh, that sounds like fun, but we got a ring to find!
Here's your tea, Phoebe.
Mm. It's so good.
Oh, thanks. That's sweet.
Good. So glad you like it.
Oh. What?
What? She made the tea.
No, I think I just had a contraction.
You what? My God.
Yeah, I thought I felt one a couple minutes ago.
And now I know that definitely was one. Well, you can't have the baby here!
I haven't sterilized the apartment since the guys moved out!
It's okay. We're gonna be okay.
You know what? It's okay. I'm gonna boil some water and just rip up some sheets.
Ow, it's all right. It's probably false labor.
They said that, that can happen near the end. So just...
Somebody get the book. Rachel, get the book.
The book. Okay. Okay. Here.
The Bible? I don't know!
All right. Okay, okay. This is great.
Uh, Chandler, you get behind the desk.
And when she comes in, hopefully she won't recognize you because...
Well, why would she?
Uh, okay. And then you buzz Ross and I.
You be Mr. Gonzales, and I'll be Mr. Wong.
Diverse.
Anybody call for security?
You be cool.
Okay. Which one of you guys is Gunther Central Perk?
Hey, Joey.
Where's my ring? My dead grandmother's wedding ring! Where is it?
Way to be cool, man.
What's he talking about? Oh!
There was a ring in a box on my nightstand.
After you left, it was gone.
Wait, you guys think I stole some ring?
Yeah.
We know you took it! So just save yourself the time and confess.
Okay, Who are you, the Hardy Boys?
I don't need to steal some stupid ring.
I make $1,600 a week doing what I do.
Any of you guys make that?
Marry me.
I don't get it. It was in my room all night. If she didn't take it...
...and I didn't take it and you didn't take it. Then who did?
Shh. We're trying to think.
I still don't get how you know when it's false labor.
Well, do you see any babies?
How do you feel? Okay, I guess. I mean...
I don't know.
I guess I know it's going to be over soon so...
But isn't that a good thing?
I mean, you said you were sick of this. I know.
It's just usually, when you're done with the pregnant thing...
...then you get to do the mom thing.
I'm gonna be, you know, sitting around in my leather pants, drinking tequila.
Some moms do that.
Yeah, that's even sadder.
Look, I know what I got myself into, you know?
It's just that now that they're in me, it's like...
It's like I know them, you know, and...
It just not gonna be easy when, you know, these little babies have to go away.
Oh. I know, sweetie.
But it's not like you're not gonna have anything.
I mean, you're gonna have nieces and nephews.
In some ways, that's even better.
Yeah, okay. No, really.
Really, Pheebs.
I mean, you're not gonna be the one worrying about saving for college.
Or yelling at them when they're bad.
You know? Or deciding to put them on Ritalin...
...when they just won't calm down.
You know?
You're gonna be the one they come to when they run away from home.
And the one they talk to about sex.
You just get to be cool Aunt Phoebe.
Cool Aunt Phoebe.
I am pretty cool.
Yeah, and you know what else? Oh, my God, are they going to love you.
They are going to love me. Oh!
Thanks, you guys. Again. Aw.
Oh, sweetie.
Thanks. Oh! What? Oh, God.
Just kidding.
Ah! Oh, my God.
Got you again. You're so easy.
If anything should happen to him... Joey, the vet said it's a simple procedure.
So? Things can go wrong. You don't know. What if he doesn't make it?
He will, Joe. Yeah, but what if he doesn't?
He's such a good duck.
I'm so worried about him.
Somebody lose a ring? Aah!
Oh, my God. Thank you. Thank you so much. Aah!
How's the duck?
He's doing just fine, he's resting now, but you can see him in a little bit.
Oh. Great.
Oh, hey, listen, Ross, thanks for being so cool about this.
No, that's all right. No, it's not.
I mean, you made me your best man and I totally let you down.
Hey, come on. It's not your fault. Yeah, it is.
You wouldn't have lost the ring, right?
You know what? Ross, you were right from the start.
He should be your best man. No, you should.
Look, don't argue with me. Hey, hey, hey.
I get to choose my best man.
I want both you guys.
Really?
Both you guys should be up there with me.
I mean, you two are my...
I mean, I'm lucky to have just one good...
Well, thanks, man.
I got to go check something, okay?
What a baby. Total wuss.
You guys, hurry up. The flight leaves in four hours.
It could take time to get a taxi! There could be traffic! The plane could leave early.
When we get to London, there could be a line at customs. Come on.
Six-hour trip to London. That's a lot of Monica.
Passport, check. Camera, check. Traveler's checks, check.
Who are you saying "check" to? Myself.
For remembering to pack the thing.
You know, you do a good thing, you get a check.
My mom does it. I never realized it was weird.
Hey, my mom used to put her head in the oven, so...
Actually, she only did it the one time. But it was pretty weird.
Hey. Hey.
Hey. Are you ready yet?
Yep. You got the tickets? Oh, got them right here. Check.
It's all London, baby. Here we go.
You got your passport?
Yeah, in my third drawer of my dresser. You don't wanna lose that.
Oh. There it is.
Friends  S04E23  The One With Ross's Wedding Parts I
Okay, if you need the vacuum, it's in my closet on the left side.
The garbage bags are next to the refrigerator.
But Rachel's gonna be here too. Can't I just ask her?
Heh. Yeah, okay. Give that a try.
All right, let's do it. Woohoo.
Yeah. Cheerio. London, baby.
Because that's not gonna get annoying. London, baby!
Oh, you know what? I was wrong. Ha, ha.
Well, we're all here. I guess we should get going.
Oh, I wanna come over there and give you a hug...
...and wish you luck on your wedding, but I can't get up.
Oh, I'll come hug you. Great, can you bring me the newspaper?
Yeah.
Have a great wedding. Oh. Thanks.
Hey, Chandler, I wanna hug you too. Hey.
And you might as well bring me my book. It's on the counter in your apartment.
So we're off. Have fun.
Thanks. Oh.
Oh. I can't believe you're not gonna be there.
Oh, I know.
So come. Why don't you come? What?
To London. Come to London. Please? It would mean so much to me.
Yeah, well, I gotta work. I'm sorry.
Why can't you take a couple of days off? Because I can't. I told you. No, I can't.
This is my wedding.
All right, you know what? Now we are late. Let's go, let's go, let's go!
Fine, you'll watch it on video when we get back.
Here you go, Phoebe. Here you go, Phoebo, Phoobala, Phobayboo.
You. Ha, ha.
All right, let's go. Bye, Pheebs.
Bye. Bye, Pheebs.
Mwah. Goodbye. Mwah.
Bye. Safe flight.
London, baby.
Oh, God. Oh. Do you need a hug?
You don't have to bring me anything.
All right, Chandler, do something.
Come on, do something. I am. I'm ignoring you.
Okay, I'm gonna be the on-camera guy. All right.
First stop, Westminster Abbey.
Oh, what the hell is that? That's London, baby.
All right, the hotel's here.
Wait. No, we wanna go...
No.
I know.
I'm gonna have to go into the map.
Okay, if you see a little version of me in there, kill it.
I got it.
Here we go.
Okay, listen, listen, we're not gonna have to walk this way the entire time, are we?
Oh, man, you made me lose it.
…and that was all before 10 o'clock.
The caterer rang and said it was going to be Chicken Kiev instead of Chicken Tarragon.
The florist phoned to say there aren't any tulips.
Oh, and then the cellist has carpal tunnel syndrome...
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Emily, honey. Okay?
Well, up yours too. What?
No, no. That's "time-out." Sorry.
Sweetie, you gotta relax. Everything's gonna be great, okay?
Come on, come on.
Chicken kiev? Mm-hm.
Doesn't that sound delicious at the last minute?
I know, but something like salmon would just...
It would be so much more elegant than chicken.
And you wouldn't have to worry about the salmonella.
So, I can't wait to see where you're getting married.
Yeah. Yeah. Yes, This place is beautiful. Emily's parents got married here.
So, can't believe they're tearing it down.
It really is the most lovely building you'll ever see.
I mean, it's over...
Oh, my God.
It's nice.
Oh. Oh, my God.
How can this be happening? What are we gonna do?
It's all right! Everything's gonna be all right.
How is it gonna be all right? Uh-huh, I see that.
Okay, I talked to the guy with the shovel and I found out what happened.
What? What? They tore it down a few days early.
All right.
Westminster Abbey.
Hands down, best abbey I ever seen.
Hey.
Okay.
What do you think of the abbey, Chandler?
Oh, I think it's great. It's great. Y'know, They're thinking of changing the name of this place.
Really? To what? To "Put the Camera Away."
Man, you are Westminster Crabby.
Honey, don't get up. What do you need? Oh, no. Oh, nothing.
Come on. I'm here to take care of you. What do you need? Anything.
Okay, I have a wedgie.
Okay, that is all you.
So, what do you want for lunch?
Oh, I don't know.
I guess we have to eat. Yeah, I do.
What's the matter?
I'm just bummed the way I left things with Ross.
I wish I didn't lie to him about having to work.
He seemed so mad at me.
Ah, don't be so hard on yourself. If someone I was still in love with was...
Still in love with? Yeah.
I'm not in love with Ross.
No, no. Good.
Yeah, me neither.
Phoebe, I'm not going to Ross' wedding, because he's my ex-boyfriend...
...and that would be really uncomfortable.
Not because I'm still in love with him. Hey, I like Ross as much as the next guy.
You know, clearly I have feelings for him, but feelings don't mean love.
You know, I mean, do I still have loving feelings for Ross?
Yeah.
I have continuing feelings of love.
But that doesn't mean that I'm still in love with him.
You know, I mean, I have sexual feelings for him, but I do love him.
Oh, my God. Oh, my...
Why didn't you tell me?
We thought you knew. We?
Yeah, we all know. We talk about it all the time.
You all know? Does Ross know?
Oh, no. Ross doesn't know anything.
Oh. I cannot believe you didn't tell me.
Because we thought you knew. It's so obvious.
God, it would be like, you know, telling Monica:
"Hey," you know, "you like things clean."
Hi.
So, what are you fine gentlemen in the market for?
We've got scarves, souvenir postcards. Check this out, huh?
Oh, yeah.
That's the stuff. What do you think?
Well, I'm not gonna have to buy that "I'm with stupid" T-shirt anymore.
Well, I like it. Here you go.
All right, look, you're not really gonna buy that are you? Don't you think you've embarrassed me enough for one day?
Oh, I embarrass you?
How can I answer that when I'm pretending I don't know you?
He's just jealous. You'll fit right in. All Londoners wear them.
Oh, really? Then how come no one here anywhere is wearing one?
They're all tourists.
All right, look, if you insist on wearing that in public, you know...
...you're gonna spend the rest of the afternoon all by yourself.
Oh, yeah?
If you're gonna make me choose between you and the hat, I choose the hat.
Good choice. Thanks.
Okay, look. All right, that's it, okay?
I'm out of here. I'm not gonna be embarrassed anymore.
Hello? Hey.
I just spoke to your dad, and you know what?
He seems to think we'll be able to find a new place for the wedding
We don't have to. What, you found a place?
No, but Monica and I were talking...
...and I was so upset about the hall being knocked down...
...and she suggested that we just put the wedding off for a bit.
She said what? She said if I'm not happy...
...getting married somewhere we can find in a day, well, we should just postpone it.
Postpone it? Heh.
Emily, do you think Monica realizes how much our parents spent on this wedding?
Huh? Do you think my sister's teeny, tiny little brain comprehends...
...that people took time out of their lives...
...to fly thousands of miles to be here? Huh?
This isn't right.
I realize that people are going to be disappointed.
I'm sure they'll come back when we can do it right.
Well, I can't ask people to do that. Would you ask people to do that?
Don't you point your pants at me.
We have no choice.
Anywhere that's half-decent will have been booked months ago.
Ross, don't you understand? This is our wedding I'm talking about.
The only thing I understand is postponing it is not an option.
This is when we're getting married.
What are you saying, it's now or never? No, I'm saying it's now.
Or? There's no "or" in mine.
What is wrong with these pants?
It's not the pants. It's you who's backwards.
And if, and if you don't understand how important this is to me...
well then, perhaps we shouldn't be getting married at all.
Emily, no. Wait, stop. Emily, please...
Hey. Hi.
So did shopping help you feel any better about Ross?
Manhattan does not have enough stores.
Well, I think I can help you get over him.
You can? Yeah.
I just need you to bring me some photos of Ross...
...and, um, a small piece of chocolate...
...and a glass of tepid water.
Ooh. Is this one of those things where you throw stuff in a bag with graveyard dirt...
...and hang it from a north-facing tree?
Uh, only if you have the hiccups too.
The pictures are for you. The chocolate and water's for me.
I just didn't feel like getting up.
Okay. I'm gonna show you a picture of Ross, okay...
...and you're going to remember all the bad things about him, all right?
Really focus on his flaws. I can do that.
Certainly did that while we were going out. Heh.
Okay. Mm.
Before we get started, I just wanna say, for the record, I love Ross.
I think he's such a great guy.
Okay. Now close your eyes.
And imagine that you're with Ross. Mm-hm.
Okay, and imagine that you're kissing him. Mm-hm.
You're running your hands all over his body.
And then you run your hands through his hair...
...but, oh, ew, gross, it's some kind of grease, it's... Ugh.
I don't know.
I don't know, his hair never bothered me that much.
And you know, it was always more crunchy than it was greasy.
Okay. This is gonna be harder than I thought.
Um, ahem. Let's try some aversion therapy.
Okay. All right. Okay? All right.
Look at the picture. Okay.
All right, and, um...
Okay. How do you feel now? Well, I like you less.
Hey. Hey.
Oh. Sorry. No, no, you know what? I'm sorry.
I really shouldn't have said you that were embarrassing me.
That really wasn't cool.
And if it makes you feel any better, I've had a really lousy day.
Me too.
Yeah? No!
I had the best day ever.
Dude, check this out.
Say hi to my friend and tell him you like my hat.
Okay, so, what's your friend's name? Oh. Chandler.
Hi, Chandler.
That's... That's...
Oh, my God. That's Fergie, baby!
Joey says you don't really like his hat, but I think it's kind of dashing.
When did you...? How...?
I was trying to figure out how to get to Buckingham Palace, right?
So I'm in my map and...
Hey.
Hey. Hey.
I understand you had a little talk with Emily.
Ha, ha. Yes, I did.
And you are welcome.
Am I?
And was it your idea to postpone the wedding?
I'm gonna go to the bathroom. Wait up.
Hey, hey, since you're the fix-it lady, here's a pickle:
What do you do when the bride says she doesn't wanna have the wedding at all?
She said that? Yeah.
Why? I don't know.
I told her it was stupid to put off the wedding just because the hall was gone...
...and she, like, flipped out.
Oh, my God. You're even dumber than I am.
Excuse me?
Ross, how long have you been planning this wedding?
I don't know. A month?
Emily has probably been planning it since she was 5.
Ever since the first time she took a pillowcase and hung it off her head.
That's what we did.
We dreamed about the perfect wedding.
In the perfect place.
With the perfect four-tiered wedding cake.
With the little people on top.
But the most important part...
...is that we had the perfect guy...
...who understood just how important all that other stuff was.
I had no idea.
That pillowcase thing, I thought you guys were just doing The Flying Nun.
Sometimes we were.
Come on.
You gotta help me figure out what to do.
Okay? All right.
Come on.
Whoa. Pretty intense, huh? Yeah.
Hey, I hope Ross didn't think that we just went in there because we were uncomfortable being out here!
I hope he did.
Hello? Hey, Pheebs, it's Joey.
Hey, Joey. Hey. Ooh, ooh.
I just saw someone that looks just like you on the subway.
I was gonna go over and say hi, but then I figured he doesn't care he looks like you.
That just cost me 4 bucks.
I just called to see how the chick and the duck are doing.
They're having a great time with Aunt Phoebe.
Aunt Rachel hasn't been helpful at all.
So do you miss me?
Kind of, but I've just been having way too much fun.
Oh, so you're not homesick yet?
No, I don't think so.
All right, well, the seven of us miss you.
Who's seven? Well, you know, me, Rachel...
...the birds, the babies.
Aw, the babies miss me?
Ooh, pizza guy's here. What? You ordered pizza without me?
Yeah, but we were thinking about you. We ordered the Joey Special.
Two pizzas?
Yeah. Okay, gotta go. Talk to you later. Wait, wait. Where did you get it from?
Monica, why have you brought me here of all places?! You'll see.
I tell you, this wedding is not gonna happen.
Oh, Ross.
Okay? But imagine a lot more lights, okay, and, you know, fewer bricks...
...and flowers and candles.
Okay, and the musicians, they can go over here, okay?
And the chairs, they can face this way and...
You go.
But if you don't love this, then we'll do it any other place...
...any other time.
Really, it's fine. Whatever you want.
It's perfect.
And, I don't know, if it starts to rain... Well, then we'll get wet.
I don't even have a date.
Pheebs? Yeah?
Do you remember where the duck food is?
Yeah, it's in the guys' apartment, under the sink. Why?
Because I'm going to London.
What? What do you mean, you're going to London?
Yeah, I have to tell Ross that I love him.
Now, honey, you take care, and you don't have those babies till I get back. Mwah.
Rachel, you can't go. Ross loves Emily.
I know, I know, I know he does, but I have to tell him how I feel.
He deserves to have all of the information. Then he can make an informed decision.
That's not why you're going. You're going because you hope he'll say:
"Yeah, I love you too, Rach. Forget about that British chippie."
Do you think he will?
No, because he's in love with the British chippie.
Look, Rachel, if you go, you're just gonna mess with his head and ruin his wedding.
You know? It's too late. You missed your chance.
I'm sorry. I know this must be really hard.
But it's over.
You know what? No. It's not over until someone says "I do."
I do. I do! I do!
Yeah, like I can really chase you. I'm carrying a litter.
Previously on Friends:
I can't believe you won't be there. I know.
Why can't you take a couple of days off?
Because I can't. This is my wedding.
So,I can't wait to see this place you're getting married! Emily's parents got married here.
It really is the most lovely building you'll ever see. It's right over...
Oh, my God!
The only thing I understand is postponing is not an option.
I tell you, this wedding is not gonna happen.
If you don't love this, then we'll do it any other place or any other time. Really, it's fine.
It's perfect.
I'm going to London. What?
It's not over until someone says, "I do."
I do! I do! I do!
Rachel, no!
The Waltham residence.
Hi, is this Emily's parents' house?
This is the housekeeper speaking.
And, by the way, that is not how one addresses a person on the telephone.
First one identifies oneself...
...and then asks for the person with whom one wishes to speak.
Um, this is Phoebe Buffay.
I was wondering, please...
...if it's not too much trouble, please...
...um, might I speak with Miss Emily Waltham, please?
Miss Waltham is at the rehearsal dinner.
And it is not polite to make fun of people. Goodbye.
No, no! I'll be nice, I swear.
Could you just give me their number?
I'm afraid I'm not at liberty to divulge that information.
Ok, somebody is on their way to ruin wedding okay. And I have to warn somebody,
alright. So if you don't give me that number then I'm going to come over there...
...and I'll kick your snooty ass all the way to New Gloukenshire!
Hello? Hello? Oh!
Ooh, she knew I could kick her ass.

Hi, sweetheart.
Mom, Dad.
Oh, sorry, we're late.
My fault. I insisted on riding the tube.
Judy, the kids!

Dad, dad. We got it!! We Got It!!!
Oh! Here comes my dad and stepmom.
Mr. And Mrs. Geller.
This is Steven...
...and Andrea Waltham.
How do you do? Very nice to meet you.
Ha, ha! Eh, darling, the Gellers.
Darling, it's the Gellers.
She's very self-absorbed, you know. I should never have married her.
Sorry, what? It's the Gellers.
Where? That's one and that's another one.
Lovely to meet you.
Terribly nice of you to offer to pay for half the wedding.
Ohh forget it. Too hell with tradition, We're happy to do it.
Oh, we know how expensive weddings can be.
Besides, this may be the only wedding we get to throw.
Ha ha, a joke that's funny in all countries.
Sir?
What's in it? Goat cheese, watercress and pancetta.
That's not food.
No, I don't want it.
Everything's different here. I want to go home.
I miss my family, I miss the coffee house.
I can't even remember what Phoebe looks like.
Joey, it's been three days.
Okay, you're just a little homesick.
Okay. Would you just try to relax and just enjoy yourself?
You're different here too.
You're mean in England!
What the hell?
What's up, Dad?
This bill for my half of the wedding. it's insane.
How could it be so much? The reception's at their house.
Flowers, liquor. Re-carpet first floor?
New guest bath, landscaping.
I'm paying to remodel this guys house.
I'll give that son of a bitch a piece of my mind.
Dad, dad, please.
Look I don't want anything to upset Emily tonight.
Alright, She's had a hard enough couple of days as it is.
Now here, here, let me go talk to him, okay?
And you tell him no one takes advantage of the Gellers.
Ooh, Jack.
Sometimes I forget how powerful you can be.
And I'm going to go get drunk.
Hi. Hello.
Hello.
Um, when is your next flight to London?
There's one leaving in 30 minutes. Oh!
And I do have one seat left.
Oh, thank you, thank you.
The last-minute fare on this ticket is $2700.
Ugh. I just don't think I have enough left on my credit card.
Well you can split it with another credit card.
Okay, how about five?
Oh, thank you.
I'm just going to need to see your passport.
Okay, you know what? I don't have it, but I can tell you exactly where it is on my night stand,
and...okay. But you know what? I have my driver's license.
And I have a 20.
Look, Face it, my father is not gonna pay for the built-in barbecue.
And believe me, you can kiss your gazebo goodbye.
Now I might be able to get you the new lawn.
Ah! Then you have to give us the lawn ornaments.
I go back there with lawn ornaments, he'll laugh in my face.
Will you say something, Steven?
Don't take that tone with me.
All right, you can.
Hi, Pheebs. Oh, thank God!
Oh, you changed your mind. Ugh!
Oh, look I know you probably want to be alone, and you don't want to talk about it,
that's fine. I just want you to know, I think you are doing the right thing and...
Bye, Pheebs. Wait!! Where are you going?
What are you doing? No, wait.
Why am I always pregnant when she does that?
I'd like to toast Ross and Emily.
Of course, my big toast will be tomorrow at the wedding,
so this is kind of my little toast, or Melba toast, if you will.
Okay. I known Ross for a long time. In fact, I knew him when he was going out with his first girlfriend.
And I thought things were going to work out for him..Until the day he over inflated her.
Oh, dear God!
Hello, Waltham Interiors.
Oh! Hi, Mrs. Waltham.
I need to speak with ether one of the best men, or Ross's sister Monica.
Who is this? Oh, Phoebe, one of Ross' best friends.
If you're Ross' friend, why aren't you here?
Um, I can't fly. I'm having my brother's babies.
Am I on the radio?
No. Um...
...can I talk to one of them? It's very very important.
No, I'm bored of you now. I'm going to cut you off.
And I'm sure we're all very excited that Ross and Emily are getting married at Montgomery Hall.
I mean to think, my friend getting married in Monty Hall.
Oh, come on, Monty Hall!
Let's Make a Deal. Come on, you people!
All right, forget it. Congratulations, Ross and Emily.
Hey. Best man number two, Joey Tribbiani. Ha, ha.
I'm not good with the jokes like Chandler here.
But, uh...
I just want to say congratulations to the happy couple.
I first met Ross in this coffeehouse back home.
Home.
New York City.
Where everybody knows my name.
Uh, anyway...
...uh, I love you guys.
But not as much as I love America.
Can we please go home now?
Are you going home?
I was hoping to get to know you better.
I'm not going anywhere, sweetheart.
I was laughing.
Out loud?
I didn't want everyone to think I was stupid.
So how are you doing?
My mom's driving me crazy. But Ross is getting married! I'm happy.
I won't let anything spoil that.
I just want to say that Ross is a wonderful young man.
Oh, thanks. We like him. Ha, ha.
My God! You must have been a teenager when you had him.
There's no way in hell I'm paying for it.
Look, we're down to just one point.
Could we please，maybe just settle it after the wedding.
All-right fine, but I just want to say, I'm not paying for your wine cellar....
...You thieving, would be speaking German if it weren't for us, cheap little man.
The guy was hammered. okay? There's no way you look like Ross' mother.
Then why would he say it? Because he's crazy!
Okay? He came up to me earlier and thanked me for my very moving performance in Titanic.
My mother's right. I'll never get married.
Ha! You know what, that is...
Who wouldn't want you?
Please! I'm a single mom with a 30-year-old son.
I'm getting married today!
Morning. Ross.
I'm getting married today!
Yeah, you are. Woo-hoo!
Do you think he knew I was here?
Well I've-I've never done that with you before. Heh.
Nope. Ha, ha.
So, ahh, how are ya? How ya...How ya..
You okay?
Yeah, yeah.
You? Oh, yes, yes.
You?
We did you.
Well...
Well...I'd better get going. Oh yea yea, absolutely. Ha, ha.
Could you not look?
I don't want to look.
Uh, uh, excuse me. Yeah.
If you're planning on doing that the entire flight...
...please tell me now so that I can take a sedative.
Or maybe slip you one.
It's just, I'm, uh, kind of excited.
I'm, um, going to London to, uh, tell this guy that I love him.
Hello. Where the hell have you been?
I spent the night out. I met this cute bridesmaid. She is...
I don't want to hear about her!
Aw, Pheebs, you know you're still my number one girl.
No! No, we have an emergency. Okay? Rachel's coming to London.
Oh, great!
No it's not great. No, she's coming to tell Ross that she loves him.
But he loves Emily.
I know that!
You have to stop her. She's going to ruin the wedding.
Okay.
Okay, so I'm done my part, okay.
It's your responsibility now, The burden is off me, right?
Right.
So tell me about this girl.
Hey. Have you seen Monica?
I'm not seeing Monica.
What? What?
Look, we gotta find her.
Phoebe just called! Rachel's coming to tell Ross she loves him.
Oh, my God. I know. That's why we got to find Monica!!
You know where she is? No, okay?
What's with the third degree? Why don't you just shine a light in my eyes?
...And so then I realized. All this stuff I had been doing....
...proposing to Joshua, lying to Ross about why I couldn't come to the wedding. ...
...was all just a way of... Oh! Oh! Oh!
Oh, oh oh!! I'm sorry, Can I interrupt?
You know I just want to say that you are a horrible, horrible person.
Ehh, Pardon me?
You say you love this man, You're about to ruin the happiest day of his life.
I have to agree with your friend Pheebs.
This is a..this is a...terrible, terrible plan.
But he has to know how I feel. But why?
He loves this...this Emily person. No good can come of this.
Well I think you're wrong.
Oh, no!
And by the way, it seems to be perfectly clear that you were on a break.
Oh, my God!
It's like a fairyland.
I know. It's horrible, isn't it?
I love it. I only hope my wedding looks this good.
Ha! I just hope... You can let some go by.
Psst. Monica.
Alright, we really need to start looking out for Rachel.
I'll cover the front door. You watch that big hole at the back of the building
and I got Chandler covering Ross.
Why would I care where Chandler is? Heh.
You know, uh...
...sometimes I don't even like Chandler.
Okay. Heh.
I do.
I do. I do.
Oh yea, your right. It's the second one.
Right?
Hello, Joey.
Hey, Felicity.
Um, I thought about you all day.
Yeah? Ha, ha.
Talk New York to me again.
Forget about it. Heh.
How you doing?
There's nothing to discuss. We're not paying for your wine cellar.
You-you have to meet me in the middle here.
Hey, you keep pushing me on this, my foots going to meet the middle of your ass.
What's going on? Nothing, nothing. Everything's under control.
You want a piece of me? Is that what you're saying? You want a piece of me?
Okay! Okay! That's it!!
Parents! Parents! Back away!
All right, This is our wedding day!
From now on, everyone gets along.
And if I hear one more word...
...no grandchildren!
That's right!
Okay, okay.
Sorry, old boy.
Sorry. Sorry.
I could kill you with my thumb, you know.
What was that about?
It was this disagreement over...
My God! You look beautiful.
Oh! You were not meant to see me before the wedding. It's bad luck.
You know what, I think we've had all the bad luck we're going to have.
My God, heh, Rachel!
You're here. I can't believe it.
What happen? Why are you here?
I just came to...
I just needed to tell you...
...congratulations.
Waltham Interiors.
Mrs. Waltham? It's Phoebe.
Yea. Can I please, please, please talk to one of the best men? This is going to be the last time I promise.
There's a girl on the phone for you.
Oh, great!
Hello?
It's Phoebe.
Did you stop Rachel?
but it's okay. She just came in and gave him a hug, that it.
Nothing got ruined? No.
Oh, that's so great!

Still walking.
