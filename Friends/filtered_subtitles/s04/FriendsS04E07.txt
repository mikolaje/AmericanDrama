我刚才走进浴室  竟然看见凯西光着身体012---I just walked in the bathroom and saw Kathy naked
简直是种折磨012---It was like torture.
如果你曾当过战俘  才会惊讶的知道什么叫"折磨"012---Y'know if we ever go to war and you're captured, you're in for a big surprise.
情况变得越来越糟012---It just keeps getting worse and worse!
你知道么  够糟了  我居然爱上我室友的女朋友了012---Y'know? I mean it's bad enough that I'm in love with my roommate's girlfriend
而且  我觉得她也知道012---which by the way,I think she knows.
每次我们共处一室  空气就很诡异紧张012---Because every time we're in the room together there's this weird like energy between us.
更叫我疯狂的是  我觉得她也喜欢我012---And call me crazy, but I think she likes me too.
现在我又看到她的裸体012---And now I have seen her naked.
我是说  至少看见她穿衣服的时候012---I mean at least when I've seen her with clothes on,
我能想像她的身体是被树皮什么的给盖住的012---...I could imagine her body was like covered in boles or something.
结果没有  她是光着身子的012---But there are no boles. She's smooth.
光着的012---Smooth!
啊哦012---Wow...
他刚才那样子坐着都走光了012---Could everyone totally see up his robe?
天啊  我的天啊012---Oh, my God. Yeah.
《老友记》  第四季  第07集   钱德横刀夺爱012---Friends S04E07  The One Where Chandler Crosses a Line
拿去012---Here you go.
好  我待会打给你012---Great. so I'll call you later.
嘿  嘿  那是谁012---Hey, hey. Who was that?
那是凯希  我们晚上要约会012---Casey. We're going out tonight.
约会  哇  哇012---Going out? huh? Wow! Wow!
你跟凯西分手了  真可惜012---So things didn't work out with Kathy, huh? Bummer.
没有啊  我们很好012---No, things are fine with Kathy.
我跟她吃饭之前要先跟凯希吃012---I'm having a late dinner with her tonight, right after my early dinner with Casey.
什么012---What? Yeah.
是的  是的  更夸张的是我刚刚一个人吃了一整个披萨012---Yeah-yeah. And the craziest thing is that I just ate a whole pizza by myself!
慢着  你要跟凯西约会012---Wait...  You're going out with Kathy.
对  你怎么变得颠三倒四的012---Yeah. Why are you getting so upset
我是颠三倒四012---Well, I'm upset...
全是因为你012---...for you.
我是说  没完没了和各色美貌女子上床  恐怕很难满足你012---I mean,having sex with an endless line of beautiful women must be very unfulfilling for you.
那又怎样  又不是只有我们才这么干012---What's the big deal? It's not like we're exclusive.
听着  乔伊012---Look, Joey.
凯西很明显无法满足你的感情需求012---Kathy is clearly not fulfilling your emotional needs.
但是凯希…012---But Casey...
老实说  我只看到过她的后脑勺012---I mean granted I only saw the back of her head,
但是我感觉得到她聪明风趣012---But I got this sense that she's smart and funny...
而且很在乎你012---...and gets you.
你真能从后脑勺看出这么多东西012---You got all that from the back of her head?
好吧  听着  我想你真的应该安定下来了012---All right look, I think it's time for you to settle down.
做个选择  选条道路([e lein])012---Y'know? Make a choice, pick a lane.
谁是"伊莱恩"([i'lein])012---Who's Elaine?
小泰山东尼012---"Little, tiny Tarzan,
用鼻毛荡来荡去  悠闲的荡着秋千...012---swinging on a nose hair. Swinging with the greatest of ease..."
该死的  现在我不知道该怎么接下一段012---Darn it! Now,I don't know who to get to the next verse.
你可以唱012---Oh, you could just go uh,
"很悠闲呀012---"greatest of ease...
BAH-bah-bha-bhannn012---BAH-bah-bha-bhannn."
然后继续下去012---Then go right into it.
也对  我喜欢012---Yeah, ooh, I like that!
等一下  你是怎么知道的012---How do you know about "ba-ma-na-ma-na-ma"?
你知道  我过去也经常弹奏乐器012---Well umm, y'know, I used to play.
对了  对了  是电子琴012---Oh yeah, that's right, the keyboards, huh?
高中只是玩玩  到大学时就完全地沉迷其中了012---Yeah, just a little in high school, but then I really got into it in college.
我是说  我那是真的找到属于我的声音012---I mean that's-that's when I really found my sound.
我把果汁喷出来了  但是值得012---Oh God! Orange juice just came out of my nose, but it was totally worth it.
天哪012---Oh, my God.
我已完全忘记你的那种"声音"了  是啊012---I completely forgot about your sound. Yeah.
他常把自己锁在地下室好几个小时012---He used to lock himself in the basement for hours.
谁也不准听那个"声音"012---No one was every allowed to hear, "The Sound."
我想听那个 "声音"012---I want to hear "The Sound."
真的  不行  我很久没弹了012---Really? No. I mean, nah, I haven't played in so long,
那是很私密的东西012---and-and, well it's-it's really personal stuff, y'know?
来嘛  演奏你那恐怖的音乐吧  "小孩"012---Come on, play that funky music white boy.
是啊   不行啦012---Yeah, boy. No, you guys,
我的电子琴早就在我那  收起来了  好吧  我去拿012---I mean my keyboards are all the way up in ... Oh Yeah, okay.
可以了012---Okay, guys.
你竟然又找出来了012---All right. Bring it on, you.
我们开始吧012---Here we go.
你们要知道  我从未...从未在别人面前表演过我的作品012---Y'know, I've-I've never played my stuff for anyone before,
所以你们得清楚一件很重要的事012---so it's important that-that you understand
我将和大家交流012---... it's about communicating...
非常私人的感情012---...very private emotions.
你们还得知道012---Y'know, umm,
你们得...呃  你们要思考  我的作品012---you should-you should think of umm, my work...
就像是是无言的诗012---...as wordless sound poems.
我还要说...  噢  天呀  快弹012---That's what I'm.... Oh.my God! Play!
听啊  简直太...012---Boy, that was-that was, umm...

对  你应该到公众场合来弹012---Yeah. I mean, you should play in public.
谢谢你们  这真是…012---Wow, thanks, you guys. That's...ohhh,
我想再为大家演奏另一首曲子012---I wanna, I wanna play you another piece!
啊哦012---Umm! Uh-oh!
直升机音效在另一张磁片里  我去拿  我马上回来012---I left my uh, helicopter sounds on another disk. I'll be right back! Okay?
这太好了  我是说  我是如此012---This is so nice.  I'm -- I am so...
幸好老爸的地下室有隔音层012---Oh God bless my dad sound proofing the basement!
我不敢相信  他竟然用弹奏这种曲子的手指抚摸过我012---I can't believe I ever let him touch me with those fingers.
你们在说什么  我好喜欢012---What are you guys talking about? I loved it.
太动人了012---It was so moving.
而且它还同你们平常听的东西完全不一样012---Oh, plus it's just, it's so different from the stuff you usually hear.
你是说音乐吗012---You mean music?
我知道你在想什么012---Yeah, I know what you're thinkin'!
你的胸部也很结实而且诱人012---Yes, yes, your breasts are just as firm and juicy.
请进012---Come in.
天哪012---Hey.
那是《海滩游侠》吗012---Oh, God. Is that Baywatch?
对  是的  但我只是看看演员表而已012---Uh yes, but uh, I just watch it for the articles.
乔伊在吗012---So is Joey around?
不在  还没回来  但是他再过几分钟就回来了012---No-no, he's not back yet, but he'll be here any minute.
先请进  坐一会吧  船头还是船尾012---So uh, come on in. Have a seat. Bow or stern?
我无所谓坐哪  你呢012---I uh, don't really have a preference. You?
我喜欢后面012---I like it in the stern.
船尾012---Of the boat.
听着  是我  我和凯希在回来的路上出了状况012---Hey, It's me. Listen Casey and I were on our way back and had a little car trouble.
怎么了  我们在专属车道上抛锚了012---What happened? We broke down on the Parkway,
我得走回去找一些变速液012---so I have to walk back and get some transmission fluid.
听着  请告诉凯西  抱歉  我会尽快赶回来的012---And listen，you please tell Kathy that I'am sorry I'll be there as soon as I can.
你怎么不自己说  因为我只有一刻钟  而且我想投币时间快要...012---Why can't you tell her? 'Cause I only have one quarter, and I think my time is about to--
乔伊  乔伊012---Joey? Joey?
嗯012---Yeah?
我以为你时间不够了...012---I thought your time ran out.
我也以为  看来还有一点…012---Me too, but I guess I do have a couple of more --
是乔伊  他说他很抱歉  他得迟点到了012---Uhh, that was Joey. He's running a little late, he says he's sorry.
所以我想  现在只有你和我012---So I guess it's just uh, you and me then.
好012---Ok
噢  我想也是012---Okay. Yeah, I think it is.
那么今天你都干了些什么呢012---So what'd you do today?
我今天要去理发的012---Oh, I had an appointment to get my haircut...
你的发型很好看  后来没去成012---Oh, it looks great! ...and then it got canceled.
我可以帮你剪012---Well, I could cut it.
真的吗  你真的会012---Really?! You do that?
是的  我会理  我从我姑妈的狗儿理发店学的 怎么样012---Yeah, I do. Of course, I learned at my aunt's dog grooming shop, but hey, what do you say?
狗儿理发店012---Dog grooming huh?
好吧  只要别把我的"尾巴"搞得太脂粉气了012---Okay, just don't make my tail too poofy.
你的发质真的很好012---You have really great hair.
噢  谢谢  我自己种出来的012---Well, thanks. I grow it myself.
你知道么  乔伊的发质也很好012---Y'know who also has great hair is Joey!
对  乔伊的发质很好012---Yes! Yeah! Joey has great hair!
差不多完了  帮你清理一下脖子上的头发屑012---Umm, I'm basically done here. Just let me get this off your neck.
你在干什么012---What-what 'cha doin'?
检查看着是不是比较自然012---Checking to see if it's even.
怎么样012---'Kay.
看来没问题012---Looks good.
噢  是电话  电话在响012---Oh the phone! The phone's making sounds.
哈罗  老兄  是我012---Hello. Hey, dude, it's me.
是乔伊012---Hey, it's Joey.
听着  抱歉啊  看来我被困在这里了012---Listen uh, I'm really sorry, it looks like I'm gonna be stuck here for a while.
我弄到变速液了  但是要加时012---I got the transmission fluid, but when I went to put it in the car,
却发现变速器不见了012---the transmission wasn't there!
什么  可能是在前几个路口就掉了012---What? Yeah, it must've fallen out a few blocks back.
听到异响  我还以为撞到了狗012---I just figured we hit a dog.
好吧012---Okay.
请凯西来听  我想跟她道歉012---Listen uh, could you put Kathy on, I wanna apologize.
好012---Oh yeah man.
乔伊012---Joey.
嗨012---Hey...
噢  一切都还好  不用为我担心012---No, it's fine. Don't worry about it.
不用道歉  不要紧的012---Yeah-no, stop apologizing, it's okay.

不  不  不  不  这太差劲了  太差  太差劲了012---No-no-no-no, this is bad! It's bad! This is bad!
太糟糕了012---Horrible!
等等  你是说吻还是状况012---Wait the uh, the kiss or the situation?
不  不  不  这个吻很棒012---No-no-no, the kiss was good.
不  就是这个吻太可怕了  是的  我们应该012---No, but that's bad! Ooh! Yes! Okay! Here's what we do,
应该当什么都没发生过  什么012---we-we forget it happened. What?
好吧  我们得隐藏我们的感情012---Okay, we-we swallow our feelings.
即使这样会痛苦一辈子  听起来好些么012---Even if it means we're unhappy forever. Sound good?
你真的做得到012---Can you really do that?
我不得不  他是我最好的朋友012---I have to. He's my best friend.
而你在跟他交往012---And you're seeing him.
钱德  我很喜欢乔伊012---Chandler, I like Joey a lot.
但是跟你…012---But with you...
不  不  别说了012---No, don't. Don't, see?
你会把我搞乱  我已经开始渴望了012---You're getting me confused. I'm starting to yearn.
对不起012---I'm sorry.
要是你想假装没事  我可以试试看012---If you want to pretend that nothing happened, I can try.
我们非这么做不可012---I think we have to.
好吧012---Okay.
再见  再见012---Bye. Bye.
你是不是还没走012---Are you still out there?
没有012---No.
通电中...012---Electrifying
加重  时间  时间  时间012---Emphatic time-time-time...
你们知道么  过去三个街口有一家"星巴克"012---Y'know, there's a Starbucks about three blocks down.

谢谢大家  大家  大家...012---Thank you guys-guys-guys...
接着不是该你吗012---Hey, aren't you up next?
噢  不  我今晚不想弹了  为什么012---Oh no, I'm not playing tonight. Why not?
我不能接在罗斯后面012---I can't follow Ross.
就像披头士演完了012---It'd be like those bicycle ridding chimps
接着让骑自行车的黑猩猩演奏一样  不行012---that followed The Beetles. No....
菲比  罗斯简直太糟糕了012---Phoebe. Ross sucks.
菲比  他把客人都吓跑了012---Phoebe, the place has emptied because of him.
天哪  在他自己的时代都没有人欣赏他012---Oh my God, he's not even appreciated in his own time.
我巴不得能跟他一样的寂寞012---I'd give anything to not be appreciated in my own time.
好  菲比…012---Okay. Umm, Phoebe,
你也很差劲012---You suck too.
没错  菲比012---Yeah, Phoebe.
你也差到一定份上了012---You're awful.
你们俩012---You guys.
你们俩都很差012---You suck too.
天哪  简直无法相信  我又把自己锁在外面了012---Aww man! I can't believe I locked myself out again!
等一下  老兄012---Hang on, buddy.
天哪  出了什么事012---Oh my God! What happened here?
这都是你买的  我想是的012---Did you do all this? I sure did.
为什么  我只是认为  为我的朋友做点事  让我感觉很好012---Why? Well, I just thought it'd make me feel good to do something nice for my friend.
你简直太不可思议了012---Well, you're amazing.
不  不  不  这些东西才不可思议呢012---Oh no-no-no. This is amazing.
凭空冒出来的电视012---A TV as if it appears from nowhere!
简直象做梦一样  老兄012---That's the dream! Man,
你哪来这么多钱012---how did you afford this stuff?
我都29了  还存那么多钱干什么012---Well, y'know I'm 29. I mean who needs a savings account.
你是世界上最棒的朋友012---Oh, you are the best friends anyone has ever had.
那可不一定012---Oh, I don't know.
不  不  不  你是的012---Oh-no-no-no, you are!
你买这些东西  还给我忠告012---You do this, you give me the great advice,
听着  昨天你让我只对一个女孩子好012---and hey listen, I was thinking about what you said yesterday about focusing on one woman,
我决定照做012---I'm gonna do that.
是不是打算和凯希012---You mean with Casey.
不  不  不  我想继续跟凯西交往下去  她很酷012---No-no-no, I think I'm gonna see how things go with Kathy. She's pretty cool.
或者凯希  不  不  凯西012---Or Casey. No-no, Kathy.
凯希也行012---Could be Casey.
不  不  凯西012---No-no, Kathy.
考虑一下凯希012---Consider Casey.
你知道我怎么想么  看来有人喜欢凯希了012---Y'know what I think? I think somebody's got a little crush on Casey.
要不要我撮合你们俩呢  你怎么想012---How 'bout I fix you two up? What do you think?
那我的生活终于可以踏入正轨了012---That all the pieces of my life are falling right into place.
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
你太棒了  你真的  真的很棒012---You were really great! You were really, really great!
谢谢  谢谢012---Oh, thanks, thanks.
摩妮卡说你以后都不再想演奏了012---So Monica tells me that uh, you don't want to play anymore
因为我...和我的才华012---because me....and y'know my talent.
是真的吗012---Is that true?
哦  大概吧  是的  菲比012---Well, kind of, yeah. Pheebs...
是的  但我无法  我很想保持乐观无所谓的态度012---Yeah, I-I can't --I mean y'know I was trying to be really y'know okay and upbeat about it...
但是在你的才华面前  我自惭形秽012---...I just -- I feel so dwarfed by your musical gift. I...
但是…012---See, but...
菲比  这和我演奏的初衷完全相反了012---Pheebs that-that is the exact opposite intent of my music.
你知道  我的音乐是要鼓舞人心的012---Y'know my music is-is meant to inspire,
如果这样反而挫伤了你012---If it bothers you this much...
那我以后  就不再演奏了012---...then I won't play anymore.
不  不  不  千万不要012---Oh no. No-no-no, don't do that!
如果离开你的音乐  我怎么能活得下去呢012---How could I live with myself if I knew I was depriving the world of your music.
好吧012---Yeah, okay.
嘿  钱德  看到新家具了  非常漂亮012---Hey Chandler! Saw the new furniture. Very nice.
乔伊有你这个男朋友真好012---Yeah! Joey has the best boyfriend ever!
我吻了凯西012---I kissed Kathy.
什么  你是说真的012---What? Are you serious?
乔伊知道吗  不知道012---Does Joey know? No.
你们认为有没有可能  他能谅解吗012---Is there anyway, anyway you think he'll understand this?
你显然还没有深入了解你的室友012---You obviously haven't screwed over a lot of your friends.
这正是让我们都敬佩不已的012---Which we all appreciate.
不  最可悲的是  如果你在亲她之前告诉乔伊你的感受012---No the-the sad thing is, if you had told him how you felt before you kissed her,...
乔伊肯定会把她让给你的012---...knowing Joey, he probably just would've just stepped aside.
别  不要告诉我  不要告诉我  那是真的012---Oh, don't say that! Don't say that. That's not true. Is it?
我想可能  是真的  他爱你012---I think maybe, yeah. He loves you.
那你们怎么不告诉我012---Then why didn't you tell me to do that?
我跟菲比聊过012---Well, I said-I said something to Phoebe.
对  我觉得这是个好主意012---Yeah! No, that's right. And I thought it was a really good idea.
我就知道  我还记得  我也记得你告诉过我012---I know, I remember that! I remember you did.
天哪  我该怎么办012---God!! What am I gonna do?!
钱德  你得告诉他012---Well, Chandler, you're gonna have to tell him.
为什么  为什么非得告诉他012---Why?! Why do I have to tell him?!
因为你必须这么做  是的  我知道012---Because you do. Yeah, I know.
我为此写首曲子  能不能让你好过点012---Hey, would it be okay if I wrote a song about this.
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
要不要"茴香玛格丽特"鸡尾酒012---Sambuca Margarita?
那是什么东西012---It that a real thing?
哦   我们只剩茴香味力娇酒   所以就有“茴香玛格丽特”鸡尾酒了012---Well, we only had sambuca, so it is now.
听着  乔伊012---Listen, Joe.
我必须  必须要跟你谈谈了012---I-I need to, I need to talk to you about something.
什么事012---What's up?
是凯西的事012---It's-it's about Kathy.
我喜欢她012---I like her.
事实上  我非常喜欢她012---I like her a lot, actually.
真的么012---You do? Yeah.
那你现在的时机正好012---Well, you're timing couldn't be better.
她现在不是我的女朋友了012---She's not my girlfriend anymore.
什么012---What?
哦  她跟我分手了012---Yeah, she broke up with me.
什么时候的事012---Oh uh, when?
就刚才  表演课后012---Just now, after acting class.
开始我以为她只是在表演某个场景  我还叫大家来看012---At first I thought she was doing some kind of scene, that's why I let people watch.
哦  太可惜了  你还好吗012---Oh man, I am so sorry. Are, are you okay?
不太好  但我现在没事了  你喜欢她012---Well, I've been better. But, I'm all right. So you like her huh?
对  但是我可以算了012---Yes, but I-I uh, don't have too.
不  不  我没事的012---No-no-no, no it's uh, it's okay.
真的  对012---Yeah? Yeah.
你知道为什么  因为你先来告诉我012---You know why? 'Cause you came to me first.
我就知道这么干没错012---Well, I thought that would be the best thing to do.
但是  你听着  恐怕你还得努把力012---But hey, listen just so you know, you might have you're work cut out for you.
我跟她谈的时候  觉得她好像喜欢另一个人  所以..012---'Cause when I talked to her, I kinda got the feeling that she's into some other guy. So...
你知道么  这正是我想跟你谈的事情012---See uh, that's-that's actually what I wanted to talk to you about.
我想  我知道那个人是谁012---I-I think I know who the other guy is.
