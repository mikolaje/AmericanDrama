我怎么弄的  我一定是按了哪个键了012---What did I do? I must have hit something on the remote.
我们有付钱吗012---Do we pay for this?
没有  我们连第四台有线的都没付012---No, we didn't even pay our cable bill.
也许这是他们的处罚方式012---Maybe this is how they punish us.
也许我们应该欠电话费  免费色情电话012---Maybe we shouldn't pay our phone bill. Free phone sex.

你一定很难受  不过  隔壁有免费的A片看012---You must feel horrible. Hey, the guys have free porn.
不了012---No.
高兴点  你们会再见面的  对吗012---Hey, cheer up. You're gonna see her again, right?
是这样的  我就是不知道012---Well, that's the thing. I don't know.
每次我提起她就说012---I mean, whenever I brought it up with her, she said:
"这样就很棒啊  何必谈到未来012---"This is so fantastic. Why do we have to talk about the future?
就享受现在多好"   别学英国腔012---Let's enjoy..." Don't do the accent.
你得再见她一次012---You've got to see her again.
干嘛这么在意012---Why do you care?
因为012---Because.
你可以实现我的幻想012---You could get to live out my fantasy.
你对艾蜜莉有幻想012---You've had fantasies about Emily?
不是  就是  那个幻想嘛012---No. You know, the fantasy.

疯狂坠入爱河  然后共度余生012---...fall madly in love and spend the rest of your lives together.
所以  你国中时012---Is that why, in junior high...
老是跟那个乌克兰的男生混012---...you were the only one who hung out with that Ukrainian kid?
对  还有他妈妈总是把酸奶油抹在所有吃的上012---Yeah, that, but plus his mom used to put sour cream on everything.
你爱她吗012---Do you love her?
我们说好只在一起两星期012---We said it was only gonna be two weeks, you know?
你爱她012---You love her.
什么才是爱012---What is love, really?
我就知道你爱她012---I knew you loved her.
你得去机场告诉她012---You need to go to the airport and tell her.
你会在她登机前追上她012---You're probably gonna catch her just as she's about to go to the gate.
你会叫她的名字  大声喊 "我爱你"012---You're gonna call out her name and yell, "I love you."
她会说  "我也爱你"012---She's gonna say, "I love you too."
然后你们会有最深情的一吻012---Then you guys are gonna have the most amazing kiss.
登机门前掌声如雷012---Everyone at the gate will applaud.
我是很会接吻的012---I am a good kisser.
然后你们钻进驾驶舱012---Then you two can sneak into the cockpit.
热血澎湃012---Things will start to heat up.
再后来一个空姐进来012---And then a stewardess comes in...
我看成人A片太多了012---I've been watching too much porn.
那是心跳吗  没错012---Is that the heartbeat? That's it.
天哪012---Oh, my God.
太酷了012---Oh, wow. This is so cool.
我们谈过多胞胎的可能吗012---Have we talked about the possibility of multiple births?
先搞定这一胎012---Why don't we just take care of this one?
我要是想再怀孕   我会留住你的名片012---And should I get pregnant again, I'll hold onto your card, okay?
不是  我听到了三个不同的心跳音012---No, I'm getting three separate heartbeats.
三个  你们还担心我一个都怀不上呢012---Three? You guys were worried I wouldn't even have one.
医生经常犯错012---Doctors are wrong all the time. Well...
你确定有三个012---Well, so are you sure that there are three?
绝对的  天哪012---Definitely. Oh, my God.

再过几个月012---So in a few months...
就会有三个孩子在我肚子里转悠012---...I'm gonna have three full-grown babies just walking around inside me?
然后他们就像012---Oh, oh. And it's gonna be like one of those log rides...
连发炮一样冲出来012---...when they just come shooting out.
其实  生三个跟生一个一样012---Giving birth to three babies is not that different than giving birth to one.
你懂什么啊012---What do you know?
菲比  嗨012---Phoebe. Oh! Hi.

你们高兴就好  我还怕你们会吓坏了012---Oh, God. I'm so glad you guys are happy. I was so afraid you we're gonna be freaked.
为什么要吓坏呢012---Oh. Why would we be freaked?
可能因为三个养起来更累也更花钱012---No, because maybe it's harder to raise them and the added expense. Ugh!
也对012---Oh. Right.
别停   继续高兴  继续高兴012---No, back to happy. Back to happy!
不  没问题的012---No, no, no. It's gonna be fine...

而且我很喜欢冷冻库012---And I love refrigerators. Yeah.
你不能放弃梦想012---You can't give up on your dream. Ugh.
不  没关系  我们将有三个孩子012---No, it's okay. We're gonna have three kids.
这是另一种梦想012---And that's a different kind of dream.

说得好012---Good one.
还没完  因为她会给你打电话  告诉你她爱你012---It's not over because she's gonna call you and tell you she loves you.
而她先前不说原因是  她感觉太强烈了  她害怕012---The reason why she couldn't is because her feelings were so strong that it scared her.

艾蜜莉012---Emily. Hi.
旅途还顺利吗012---Uh, how was your flight?
糟透了012---It was dreadful.
你对我美好的告白  我却那么回应  我觉得难受极了012---Uh, I felt terrible about how I acted when you said those wonderful things.
不  不  没关系012---No, no, that's all right. Um...
我很高兴你能打来012---I'm just glad you called.
罗斯  我得告诉你这件事012---Ross, um, there's something that I've got to tell you.
我另外有一个人了012---There's someone else.
这句话在英国的意思  跟在美国一样吗012---Does that mean the same thing in England as it does in America?
她不知道她想要谁012---She doesn't know which one of us she wants.
我还是那个叫 "柯林" 的家伙.012---Me or this "Colin" guy.
不应该是这样的  不应该有别人012---This isn't how it was supposed to go. I mean, there can't be another guy.
真是的012---Well...

这样更完美012---Heh. This is even more perfect.
现在你得证明你的爱012---Now you have to prove your love.
我什么也不证明  我不听你的了012---I'm not proving anything, okay? I'm done listening to you.
如果我没先听你的跑到机场去012---If I hadn't let you talk me into going to the airport in the first place...
我就不会用拳头猛砸在墙上012---...I wouldn't have put my fist through the wall.
你用拳头猛砸在墙上012---You put your fist through the wall?
不  我没打着  砸在门上了012---No, I missed and hit the door.
但砸的那扇门晃的可厉害了012---But it opened really hard.
你得去伦敦   什么012---You have to go to London. What?
你得去争取她012---Yep. You have to go fight for her.
对啊  当然  太有道理了012---Oh, yeah, sure. That makes sense.
你说你爱她而她却没回应012---Because you already told her you loved her, and she didn't say it back.
然后打来电话告诉你另有其人了012---Then she called you and told you there was another guy.
对  去伦敦吧   吓死她012---So yeah. Go to London. That will scare her.
当瑞秋跟保罗在一起时   你做了什么012---When Rachel was with Paolo, what did you do?
我嘲笑他的口音012---I made fun of his accent.
你退缩了  你让他轻松得手  你完全没有去争取   没错吧012---You sat back and let him have her. You didn't fight at all. Am I right?
你想让艾蜜莉也被抢走012---You want the same thing to happen with Emily?
不想   那就好012---No. All right, then.
去伦敦吧  去为她而战012---Go fight for her. Go to London.

这样  比他们还美012---That, but nicer.
去伦敦吧012---Just go to London.
真的  快去012---Really? Come on.

啦  啦  啦012---La-la-la.
听起来很好  但你哪来的本钱012---That sounds great. But how can you afford it?
我们在街上012---We were walking down the street...
看见你们以前承包宴席办外烩的小巴车012---...and we saw that van you used for catering.
我们就想到  让我说  让我说012---And we realized... I'm telling it. I'm telling it.
你知道人们需要交通工具012---Okay, you know how people need transportation...
但也需要按摩来放松012---...but they also need massages to relax?
我们可以结合两者  我按摩  法兰克开车012---So I just figured we could combine the two. Okay, I give the massages and Frank drives.
我可以改装一下车子  在后面安个床  你们知道我的想法了012---I can fix up the van, bolt the table in the back and you know what I've got?
有进无出的死亡小巴012---A place that no one will ever get out of alive?
不是  你们想嘛  就是给想放松的人搭的出租车012---No, think about it. It's a taxi that people take when they need to relax.
叫轻松任你行012---It's a Relaxi-Taxi.
名字是最精彩的012---The name was my favorite part.
是我想出来的  你乱讲012---Well, I came up with it. You did not!
不是  你想的是轻松之行  一点也不好听012---No. You came up with Relaxi-Cab. That's not good.
哈罗  嗨012---Hello? Hey.
天哪  你在英国吗  艾蜜莉惊喜吗012---Oh, my God. Ross, are you in England? Was Emily surprised?
不  因为她还没回家012---No, because she hasn't come home yet.
她整晚都没回家012---And she hasn't been home all night.
很显然是跟那个人在一起012---She's obviously staying with that other guy.
而我则是一晚上站在她家门口的大白痴012---And I'm the stupid moron who spent the whole night outside her apartment.
好吧  下班飞机是几点012---All right, when is the next flight out?
大概4个小时后012---About four hours.
再等等几个小时  如果她还不出现  你就回来吧012---Okay, just stay there a couple more hours. If she doesn't show up, come home.
告诉他 "轻松任你行" 的事012---Hey, tell him about Relaxi-Taxi.
问问他  是不是听着比 "轻松之行" 好012---And ask him if he thinks that is better than Relaxi-Cab.
不是轻松之行   是轻松车行   就像出租车行012---It's not Relaxi-Cab. It's Relaxi-Cab. Like Taxi-Cab.
这个比较好012---Ooh, that is better.
