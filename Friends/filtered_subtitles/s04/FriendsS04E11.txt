啊  天呀  真不敢相信  弟弟你已经结婚了012---Oh my God! I can’t believe my little brother is married!
你们俩为什么不告诉我你们准备结婚012---You guys, why didn’t you tell me you were eloping?
因为我们之前也没有想过结婚这事  那天我们去法院  我们正在吃午饭012---'Cause it just sorta happened, y'know we were at the courthouse, we were having lunch…
等等  你们去法院做什么呀012---Wait, wait, why were you at the courthouse?
我们去吃午饭呀012---We were having lunch.
然后  我们突然之间意识到012---Yeah and then all of the sudden we were like,
嘿   我们正在法院吃饭  吃完饭我们去登记结婚吧012---"Hey! Y'know, we’re here, having lunch let’s get married! right!
哇  一年半以前我甚至都不知道自己有个弟弟  现在我还有弟媳了012---Wow, a year and a half ago I didn’t even know I had a brother, and now I have a sister too.
真是太棒了012---Oh, it's so great.
好了  够了012---Okay. Okay.
别再亲了012---Stop it, don't. So,
我得送你们新婚礼物才行012---I'll get you a gift now.
你们需要什么吗012---Is there anything you need?
嗯  有啊012---Uh, yeah.
我们俩一直努力想要个孩子  嗯  几乎从我们订婚那天就开始了  我们非常着急012---We've been trying to get pregnant. uh pretty much ever since we got engaged, we'd get a jump on things,
你也知道  我们都不年轻了012---y'know no one's getting any younger. Ha-ha-ha.
但情况是  嗯  她不能怀孕012---Because the thing is, um, we're not able to, you know, uh, conceive.
我们什么方法都试过了  也去看了不少医生012---And we've tried everything, we've seen a bunch of doctors.
医生说了  我们有孩子的唯一的机会就是012---Yeah, and they-and they say that our-that our only chance to have a baby ...
把我的精子和她的卵子  放在一个器皿里012---...is that if they take my sperm, her egg, and put it together in a dish...
再放进另一个女孩的子宫里012---...and put it into another girl.
因此我们在想  你可不可以成为那个女生  把它放进去012---So we were wondering if you could be that girl that we could put it into.
那真是一个美好的礼物012---That's a really nice gift.
我刚刚还以为是要放到酱油壶里呢012---I was thinking of a gravy boat.
老友记  第四季 第14集  菲比外借子宫012---The One With Phoebe’s Uterus
嘿  快来看看  快来看看  猜我找到什么工作了012---Hey! You guys! Check it out, check it out! Guess what job I just got.
不知道  但是Donald Trump（赌场大亨）想让他的蓝色运动夹克变黑所以借你穿脏点.012---I don't know, but Donald Trump wants his blue blazer black.
什么012---What?
我是说要回  他想要回他的夹克012---Blue blazer back. He wants it back.
你刚才是说 "变黑"   他为什么想把他的蓝色夹克变黑呢012---You said "black." Why would he want his blue blazer black?
你知道我的意思012---Well, you know what I meant.
不是  你弄混了012---No,You messed it up.
你真蠢012---You're stupid.
乔伊  你找到什么工作了012---So what job did you get Joe?
博物馆里的解说员   罗斯帮我争取到的012---Oh, ah, tour guide at the museum. Yeah, Ross got it for me.
要成为解说员  不得是恐龙或者是历史专家吗012---Well, how can you be a tour guide, don't you have to be a dinosaur expert or something?
不  其实不用  他们会把资料都给你012---No, not really. They give you all the information.
嗯  就跟背剧本一样012---it's uh, it's like memorizing a script.
"在您的左边  您看到的是暴龙  一种来自侏罗纪的肉食动物."012---"And on your left, you have Tyrannosaurus Rex, a carnivore from the Jurassic period.
不赖嘛012---Very nice.
嗯  其实暴龙是来自白垩纪012---Yeah, actually, Joey, it's the Cretaceous Period.
是  但我念得是侏罗纪012---Yeah but, I can pronounce Jurassic.
嗨012---Hey!
你们猜怎么了  法兰克和艾莉丝结婚了012---Guess what. Frank Jr., and Alice got married!
啊  天啊012---Oh, my God!
还有  还有  他们要生小孩了012---And! And, they’re gonna have a baby!
还有  还有  他们还要用我的子宫来生012---And! And, they want me to grow it for them in my uterus.
天啊  你没开玩笑吧012---My God! Are you serious?
是啊012---Yeah.
你在考虑和自己的弟弟上床012---You're thinking of having sex with your brother?
你好恶心  才不是012---Ewww! And "Oh no!"
他们只是要找我代孕012---It's—they just want me to be the surrogate.
用他们的精子和卵子  我只是烤炉  面包完全是他们的012---It's her-it's her egg and her sperm, and I'm-I'm just the oven, it's totally their bun.
那你答应了没012---What did you tell them?
他们说先让我考虑考虑  但是这有什么可考虑的呢012---Well, they said that I had to think about it first, but what is there to think about?
这是我能送出的最好的礼物012---I'm gonna be giving them the greatest gift you can possibly give.
你将要帮他们怀孩子  还给他们一台索尼PS012---You'll carry their child, and get them a Sony PlayStation?
亲爱的  为他们这么做  的确是一件惊人的喜事012---Honey, this really is an incredible thing to do for them,
但是有些事你得再想想012---But there are things to think about.
是呀  你将要怀孕  是怀孕呀012---Yeah, you'd be pregnant. I mean pregnant.
我知道啊012---I know.
菲比  你的身体将接受一段可怕的经历012---Pheebs, you're talking about putting your body through an awful lot,
我是说  如晨吐  嗯  分娩012---I mean morning sickness, uhh, labour,
还全都是为了别人012---and it's all for somebody else!
是啊  你的要点是什么012---Yeah. What's your point?
我刚才说的就是啊012---Well, the stuff I just mentioned.
不知道我这辈子会不会那么做012---Wow! I don't know if I could ever do that.
我一直在想  如果我第一次怀孕  一定是为一个我爱的人012---Y'know I always figured the first time I had a baby was with somebody I love
而且我得照顾…012---and that baby would be a
那个孩子012---...a keeper.
我当初想做家具时  你们可是很支持我的012---Y'know you guys were a lot more supportive when I wanted to make denim furniture.
不是  菲比  如果你决定要这么做  我们当然会全力支持你的012---No, Pheebs, listen, if you decide to do this, we'll be supportive like crazy.
我们只是要你考虑清楚012---We just want you to think it through.
对  亲爱的  也许你可以和生过孩子的人聊聊  例如你妈妈012---Yeah, honey, maybe you can talk to somebody who's had a baby. Like your mom.
我妈才没生过小孩呢  不过我的生母有012---My mom never gave birth. Oh! But my birth mom did!
我喜欢你的小屁屁  可以让我带去上班吗012---I love this tushy! Can I take it to work with me?
哦  没问题  反正不是我的 是买裤子附赠的012---Oh, yeah, sure. It's not mine anyway. It came with the pants.
我嫉妒死了012---I am so jealous.
你们俩正在那个阶段  对吧012---You guys are really right…there aren’t you?
是啊012---Yes.
哪个阶段012---Right where?
热恋期  一天到晚的甜言蜜语012---In the beginning where it's all sex and talking...
不眠不休的性生活  还有012---...and sex and talking.and…
聊天的部分很棒012---Yeah, you-you gotta love the talking.
那上床呢012---And the sex?
好  我们还没上过床012---All right, we haven’t had sex yet.
对  那又能怎么样  你知道  这次恋爱对我来说很特殊012---Okay, What's the big deal? Y'know? This is special,
我想充分培养感情  再更上一层楼012---and I want our love to grow before we move on to the next level.
钱德  你那么做好体贴呀012---Oh, Chandler, that is so nice.
是很体贴012---That is really nice...
骗人012---...lying!
不可能是你说的那个原因  为什么012---No way is that the reason. Why?
只是因为你还不够成熟  去理解像这样的事情012---Just because you're not mature enough to understand something like that?!
不  罗斯说的对  我是在骗人012---No, he's right, I'm totally lying.
那真相是什么012---Then what is it?
因为Kathy的前任男友是乔伊012---Well, Kathy's last boyfriend was Joey.
你担心自己…技不如人012---And you're afraid you won't be able to fill his shoes?
不  我担心自己床上功夫没他行012---No, I'm afraid I won't make love as well as him.
对  我刚刚在用比喻012---Yeah, I was going for the metaphor.
对  我刚刚是直接说出来012---Yes, and I was saying the actual words.
没事啦  乔伊交过一卡车女友  这也不表示他床功一流012---So big deal, so Joey's had a lot of girlfriends, it doesn't mean he's great in bed.
我们的房只隔着一面墙012---We share a wall.
因此  要么他在床上极强悍  要么就是她喜欢附和他012---So either he's great in bed, or she just likes to agree with him a lot.
亲爱的  她和你将会不同的  有爱做基础的性会更棒012---Sweetie, with you it's gonna be different.The sex is gonna be great, 'cause you-you guys are in love.
是吗  是啊012---Yeah? Yeah.
钱德  你大胆的向前012---Just go for it Chandler.
对  试试看就知道了012---Yeah, you should, really.
那好吧  我这就去和女朋友睡觉012---All right. all right, I'll sleep with my girlfriend.
但我这么做  全是为了你们012---But I'm just doing it for you guys.
接下来这头乳齿象  是来自侏罗纪中后期012---Okay, now the Mastodon is from the semi-late Jurassic period.
乳齿象不是来自上新世吗012---Isn't the mastodon from the Pliocene Epoch?
嘘嘘  这里是博物馆  不许讲话012---Shh.This is a museum, no talking.
这里的就是…012---Right down here we have...
大脚012---...a large foot.
这位是罗斯盖勒012---And over here we have Ross Geller.
大家挥手和罗斯打招呼  说 "嗨"012---Everyone wave "hi" to Ross.
罗斯是博物馆里最重要的科学家之一  快看看他  工作多努力012---Ross is one of our most important scientists, look at him, hard at work.
好  继续参观012---Okay, moving right along.
走吧012---Come on.
门开着呢  进来吧012---It's open! Come in!
抱歉迟到了  没关系012---I'm sorry I'm late. That's okay.
我正好有时间给乳头上釉012---it gave me time to finish glazing my nipples.
哇  你为了见客还真是拼命012---Wow! You really go all out when you're expecting company.
没有  我刚刚在做陶器012---No, I was working on my pottery.
哇  哦012---Oh! Oh!
我不知道你会做…罐子012---Oh! I didn't know that you did pot.
对  大部分是裸体的  它结合了我的两大嗜好  陶器和色情艺术012---Well, yeah, Mostly nudes. It combines my two passions: Pottery and erotica.
哦  就叫 "情色陶器" 吧012---Ooh, erotiery!
不错012---Hey! Okay!
谢谢你来看我  我只是012---Well thanks for coming out to see me. I just
我只是觉得生小孩这件事  还是当面聊比较好012---I just thought it would be a very good idea to talk about this baby stuff in person.Okay.
菲比  我真的认为你不应该那么做012---I really don't think it's a very good idea, Phoebe.
为什么012---Why not?
因为  你最后还得送走孩子012---Well, because you'd be giving up a baby,
我不知道…012---And I really don't...
我不知道怎么说才能让你理解012---I don't know if there's anything I can say...
送走孩子会有多么痛苦012---...that could make you understand the pain of giving up a baby.
所以012---So...
不   我了解那种痛苦  不要伤害小狗012---No, no, I understand the pain. Don't-don't hurt the puppy.
不  不是啦  这小狗是你的了012---No, no. The puppy is yours.
我有小狗012---Oh, I get a puppy!
对  但你只能拥有三天012---Well, yeah! I mean yeah, but only for three days.
为什么012---Why?
我知道我没有权利像母亲一样管你  但是012---Y'know. I realise I don't have any right to start get all parenty on you and everything now,
菲比  麻烦别看小狗  看着我  这事非常重要012---uhh… Phoebe, would you please look at me and not the puppy, it's very important.
好012---Okay.
我是说  我知道自己以前做了什么012---I mean, I know what I'm talking about.
我抛弃了2个孩子012---I gave up two babies.
而且我真的希望  当时身边能有个前辈告诉我012---and I only wish I had someone there that had given up babies, that could tell me...
抛弃自己的孩子会有多痛苦012---...how terrible it is to give up babies.
我只是在想  那么做的后果将会是遗恨终生012---I just think that, it would be something you will regret every single day for the rest of your life.
你到时候送走这条小狗的痛苦012---So however hard it is for you to give up this puppy...
还不及送走孩子的百万分之一012---...it would be a million times harder to give up a child.
早知道  我真不应该先给你小狗012---I really shouldn't have given you the puppy first.
你介意坐在别处吗  我帮朋友罗斯留着这个座呢012---Uhh, do you mind sitting there. I'm saving this seat for my friend Ross.
你是说盖勒博士012---You mean Dr. Geller?
博士  我不知道他还有一个绰号012---Doctor? Wow! I didn't know he had a nickname.
他才不会坐在这里012---Oh, he won't sit here.
穿白袍的都会坐在那里012---Only the people in the white coats sit over there,
穿蓝色外套的就只能坐这里012---and only the people in the blue blazers sit here.
为什么这样012---Well, how-how come?
这里就是这样012---That's just the way it is.
太荒唐啦012---That's crazy.
在完美的世界里  这或许是有些荒唐  一个不分研究员和解说员的世界012---Maybe it's crazy in a perfect world: A world without lab coats and blazers.
但你不是活在完美世界里   你是在这个博物馆012---But you not in a perfect world. You in a museum now.
看到那戴眼镜的科学家没012---See that scientist in the classes,
他和我以前在小学时总是在一起玩  现如今却....012---he and I used to play together all the time in grade school, but now…
彼德  嗨  彼德012---Peter! Hey, Peter!
我是朗姐  我们是同届的啊012---It's me, Rhonda from P.S. 129?
亏我把布丁分你吃过012---I shared my pudding with you, man!
我还把点心棒送给你吃012---I gave you my snack pack!
看到没  他甚至假装没听到我说的话012---See? He pretend he don't even hear me!
我想大家都在假装没听到你说话012---I-I think everybody's pretending they don't hear you.
总之  我不了解你  我才不管什么制服和餐桌的分别的事012---Anyway, look, I don't know about you and your jackets and your separate tables, ...
不过罗斯是我最好的朋友之一012---...but Ross is one of my best friends,
而且我要是为他留了座位  我告诉你  他肯定会坐在这里012---and if I save him a seat, I'm telling you, he will sit in it!
罗斯  罗斯012---Ross. Ross.
这里  我帮你留了个座位012---Over here, man! I-I saved you seat.
不用  我坐这边很好  我一会去找你012---That's okay, I'm cool over here. I'll catch up with you later, Joey.
这个位置有人坐了012---Op, this is saved.
礼品店的012---Gift shop.
今天在自助餐厅的事  我真的  真的非常抱歉012---Hey, uh, I'm really, really sorry about what happened in the cafeteria today.
没什么  嘿   真的  你是迫不得已  对吧012---It's no big deal. Hey, y'know, you do what you gotta do. Right?
不只是我而已  我是说科学家和解说员从来都不坐在一起012---But hey, it's not just me, I mean the scientists and the tour guides never sit together.
随便你啦012---Whatever.
到处都这样  摩妮卡  帮我说说话啊012---It's like that everywhere, Joey! Okay, Mon, back me up here.
在你工作那里  服务员也是和服务员一起吃饭  对吧012---Where you work the uh, waiters eat with the waiters, right?
并且厨师和厨师一起吃  对吧012---And the chefs eat with the other chefs, right?
我自己在走廊里自己吃饭  因为人人都讨厌我012---I eat by myself in the alley, because everybody hates me.
罗斯  你听我说012---Look, Ross.
真的  真的没什么012---really it's-it's no big deal.
你知道你穿白袍  我穿蓝色制服012---Y'know you wear a white coat, I wear a blue blazer,
如果那代表着我们不能在单位成为朋友  那就这样吧012---If that means we can't be friends at work, then so be it.Y'know,
我理解012---hey I understand. Y'know?
嘿  当我在舞台上  你在观众席上  我也没和你说话  对吧012---Hey, when I'm in a play and you're in the audience, I don't talk to you, right?
所以  你知道  没事012---So it's, you know, it's, uh, cool.
明天见012---I'll see you tomorrow.
对  当他在舞台上时是没有和我们说话  但他确实挥过手012---Yeah, when we're in the audience he doesn't talk to us, but he does wave.
嗨012---Hi.
菲比  为什么对着卡尔马登(电影演员)唱歌012---Why's Phoebe singing to Karl Malden?
我想现在又到遛狗的时间了012---Ooh, y'know what, I think it's time for puppy to go out again.
走  我们去阳台  什么012---Come on, let's go to the balcony. What?
哦  是街道  快点  我们上街去012---Umm, the street. Come on, let's go to the street.
听着  我回来之前别去阳台012---Ooh, listen, don't go onto the balcony until after I get back.
怎么样  你做了吗012---So did you do it?
是  是  我们做爱了012---Yes, yes, we had the sex.
糟糕  不好喔012---Uh-oh. It was bad?
还可以  但是她附和我的程度  不像附和乔伊那样强烈012---It was fine, y'know? But she didn't agree with me as strongly as she agreed with Joey.
感觉像是 "我了解  无所谓"012---She was more like, "I see you point, I'm all right with it."
没关系  你们毕竟是第一次嘛  不可能一开始就和谐的012---Well, it was the first time. Y'know, there's not always a lot of agreement the first time.
对啊  通常都是女人觉得还不够和谐  男人却很快就满足了012---Yeah. Not for girls, anyway. Guys agree like that.
看  你得帮帮我  行吗012---Look, you have to help me. Okay?
我是说…012---I mean...
我知道该做些什么  我也知道哪里总是让人感觉美妙012---I know what to do with a woman, y'know, I know where everything goes, it's always nice.
但我需要知道…012---But I need to know ...
要使得她从美妙到…012---...what makes it go from nice to...
"天呀  那家伙让她欲仙欲死"012---..."My God! Somebody's killing her in there!"
我来告诉你  很多男人不知道的 "密笈"012---All right, I'm gonna show you something a lot of guys don't know.
瑞秋  麻烦把那本子给我012---Rach, give me that pad, please?
好吧012---All right.
来012---Now.
你不用画的那么具体  哇  身材惹火012---Look, You don't have to draw an actual... Whoa, she's hot!
好  每个人都知道的  基本的性敏感带012---Now everybody knows the basic erogenous zones.
第1个  第2个  第3个012---You got one, two, three...
第4个…012---...four...
第5个  第6个还有第7个012---...five, six and seven.
一共有7个012---There are seven?
让我看看012---Let me see that.
对   没错012---Oh, yeah.
那里也算一个012---That's one?
那个还是一个挺重要的呢012---It's kind of an important one!
哦  什么啊  我看颠倒了012---Oh, y'know-y'know what, I was looking at it upside down.
有时候反过来也不错012---Well, y'know, sometimes that helps.
男人大多数爱抚过1-2-3   就直接跳到第七个  结束比赛012---Now, most guys will hit uh, 1-2-3 and then go to 7 and set up camp.
那样不好吗012---That's bad?
如果你去迪斯尼游乐园   你不会整天都玩过山车吧012---Well if you go to Disneyland, you don't spend the whole day on the Materhorn.
如果那是象7那样的东西  也许你可能会那么做012---Well you might if it were anything like 7!
嗯  重点是慢慢来012---All right uh, the important thing is to take your time,
你得把所有的敏感部位都照顾到012---You want to hit them all...
让它们全部保持兴奋状态  就像走路那样紧绷脚趾012---... and you mix them up. You gotta keep them on their toes.
脚趾012---Oh, toes!
对一些人有用012---For some people.
好吧012---All right.
你可以从一点点1012---You could, uh, start out with a little one.
再来2012---A two.
1  2  3 搭配012---A one, two, three.
一个3012---A three.
一个5012---A five.
一个4012---A four.
来个3和2012---A three, two.
2  再配个2  4  6012---Two. A two, four, six.
2  4和7012---Two. Four, seven!
5配7   6配7012---Five, seven! Six, seven!
盖勒博士  这里有个座位012---Dr. Geller, there's a seat over here.
菲利普斯博士  谢谢你012---Thank you, Dr. Phillips.
但我的午餐…012---But I'm having my lunch...
要在这张桌子上吃  中间这一张012---...at this table. Here in the middle.
就坐在这里吃午餐012---I'm having lunch right here,
和我的好朋友乔伊一起吃012---...with my good friend Joey,
如果他愿意和我坐在一起012---If he'll sit with me.
盖勒博士  我跟你坐012---I will sit with you, Dr. Geller.
你们知道吗…012---You know...
我们在自然史博物馆工作012---...we work in a museum of natural history.
然而有一件事…012---And yet, there is something...
却很不自然012---...unnatural...
我们吃中饭的方式很不自然012---...about the way we eat lunch.
现在  我环顾这间餐厅  你知道我看到什么吗  是隔阂012---Now, I look around this cafeteria, and y'know what I see, I see-I see division.
穿白大褂和蓝制服的人之间的隔阂012---Division between people in white coats and people in blue blazers.
我扪心自问 "天啊  为什么会这样"012---and I ask myself,  "My God, why?"
我建议大家脱掉…012---Now, I say we shed these-these coats...
造成我们隔阂的这些外套012---...that separate us.
真诚的相互了解012---And we get to know the people underneath.
我是罗斯012---I'm Ross!
我离过婚  还有个小孩012---I'm divorced and I have a kid!
