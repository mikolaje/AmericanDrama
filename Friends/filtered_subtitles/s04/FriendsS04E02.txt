不  她是一个人012---No. She was a human lady.
这是莉莉妈妈的灵魂自杀的那个012---This is the spirit of my mom, Lilly. The one that killed herself.
是她变成一只猫   还是你又偷吃外婆的青光眼药012---Are you sure she's in the cat, or have you been taking your grandma's glycoma medicine again?
没有  疑心病博士012---No, Dr. Skeptismo.

莫妮卡  我两小时找不到他  他跑去跟艾美·威奇嘿咻012---Monica! I couldn't find him for two hours! He was having sex with Amy Welch!
那是高中的事  你怎么还会在意012---Come on, that was back in high school! How could that still bother you?
我是说  你为什么偏要跟奇普约会012---I mean why, of all people would you want to go out with Chip?!
听着  我们的高中不一样012---Look, you and I went to different high schools...

那时候  我以为永远不可能跟奇普约会012---Back then, I thought that I would never, ever get the chance to go out with a Chip Matthews.
现在  他打来约我012---and now he's-he's called me up and asked me out.
我心中那个胖女孩真的很想去  这是我欠她的012---And the fat girl inside of me really wants to go. I-I owe her this.
我从不让她尽情的吃012---I never let her eat.
你去吧  真的012---You go out with him. Really?
如果可以  你能不能丢下他去跟别人做爱012---Just, if it's possible, could you leave him somewhere and go have sex with another guy?
我试试看012---I'll try.
你们的娱乐柜卖得怎样012---So you guys having any luck getting rid of the entertainment center?

菲比  你妈要跟我们在一起多久012---So Pheebs, how long is your mom gonna be with us?
我不确定012---I'm not sure.
直到她能接受我有了...012---I mean, I guess until she You know, gets used to the fact that there's...
新(妈妈)吧012---a new mom.
她很担心会被取代012---I think she's worried that You know, she's gonna, she's gonna be replaced.
才不会呢  对不对012---That's not going to happen, is it?
我去房里回个电话012---Okay, I have to return a call in the other room.
怎么不在这里打012---Why can't you use the phone in here?
我要打给住在(海边)的妈妈012---Well, I'm returning a call from a certain mom at the B-E-A-C-H.
我说反了012---I just spelled the wrong word.
是我疯了  还是有人也觉得菲比的妈像一只猫012---So, guys, am I crazy, or does Phoebe's mom remind anyone of a cat?
罗斯  别提了  拜托012---Ross, don't start. Come on.
你们真的相信  那只猫是一个女人变的012---You can't tell me you actually believe that-that there's a woman inside that cat!

我们有一艘独木舟012---We got a canoe.
我们不需要独木舟012---You know, I, I really don't think we need a canoe.
你们一定要收下独木舟012---You gotta take the canoe!
那好  你们就把柜子搬走吧012---All right, just, just take the entertainment center.
等你们到家  再把独木舟扔掉012---and then when you get home, throw the canoe away!
想都别想  那是我亲手造的012---We're not throwing it away! I built that canoe!
