跟罗斯住的感觉如何012---Hey, so, uh, how's it going living over at Ross'?
很不错012---It's good,
只不过他逼我们整天看探索频道012---except he makes us watch the Discovery Channel all day long.
你知道一个中世纪的丑八怪012---Did you know that something really boring happened
经历过一件很无聊的事吗012---to someone ugly in the Middle Ages.
谢谢  待会见012---Oh, thank you. I'll see you guys later.

那杯外带咖啡真是幸运012---That is one lucky togo cup of coffee.
亲爱的  我希望你能忘了她012---Honey, I wish you would get over her.
我讨厌看到你这个样子012---I hate seeing you like this.
有什么我能帮上忙的吗012---Is there anything I can do for you?
你想看看我的胸部吗012---Do you wanna look down my top?
谢谢  以后再说吧012---Thanks. Maybe later.

我希望跟我心爱的女人共度情人节012---I wanna be with the woman I love on Valentine's Day.
我希望她也同样爱我012---I want her to love me back.
知道我们永不可能在一起  令我痛彻心扉012---And I want just one moment of relief from the gutwrenching pain
我希望能从这种痛苦中有片刻解脱012---of knowing that that's never going to happen!
我们有红色百吉饼012---We have red bagels.
好吧012---Okay.

蒙娜对瑞秋搬过去有什么看法012---So, how does Mona feel about you and Rachel living together?
我正要告诉她012---Oh, I'm actually on my way to tell her right now.
她一整个星期都在父母家待着012---Yeah, she's been away all week visiting her parents,
但她会接受的  她一直都很支持我012---but she'll be cool. She's been so supportive.
她甚至帮宝宝买了件小T恤012---She even got the baby a tiny Tshirt that says
上面写着"化石是我朋友"012---"Fossils are my friends."
少来了  蒙娜  别拍马屁012---Come on, Mona. Don't kiss ass.
我得走了012---So I'm gonna take off.
糟糕  瑞秋想看这卷录影带012---Oh, shoot! Oh, shoot! Rachel wanted to see this tape.
那是什么  我朋友生孩子的录影带012--- What is it?  It’s a video of my friend giving birth.
你能带回家给她吗012---Could you take it to your apartment?
"糖果与饼干"012---"Candy and Cookie"?
糖果是妈妈  饼干是女儿012---Yeah. Candy's the mom, Cookie's the daughter.
她爸爸也叫饼干012---The father's name is also Cookie.
为什么我会跟这种人做朋友012---Why am I friends with these people?
菲比  过来012---Phoebe, come here.
你到卫生间来  我有样东西给你看012---I wanna show you something in the bathroom.
莫妮卡  成熟点吧012---Monica, grow up.
你背后藏了什么东西012---What's behind your back?
没什么012---Nothing. Just...
跟情人节有关  希望菲比能给点意见012---Just something I want Phoebe's opinion on for Valentine's Day.
你不想听我的意见吗  不要012--- You don't want my opinion?  Not really.
少来了  我是你哥哥  问我吧012---Come on, I'm your older brother. Ask me.
好吧  哥哥012---Okay, big brother.
你觉得你妹妹穿哪一件012---Which of these do you think would make
会更惹火012---your little sister look hotter,
让你的铁哥们更想干她012---so your best friend would want to do her?
红色那件012---The red one.
我知道你最近很沮丧012---Look, I know you've been really depressed lately,
所以我带了样东西来帮你打气012---so I brought someone to cheer you up.
现在门外就有一位活生生  毛茸茸的玩物012---Right outside is a real, live, furry playmate.
我不要再跟你朋友珍上床了012---No, I'm not sleeping with your friend Jane again.
是狗狗012---Hey, a dog!
你得承认  它长得有点象珍012---Who, you gotta admit, looks a lot like Jane.
这是世上最开心乐观的狗狗012---This is the happiest dog in the world.
我问朋友温蒂借来的012---I borrowed him from my friend Wendy.
你可以一直养着它  直到心情好转012---So you can keep him till he cheers you up.
它绝对会让你心情好转012---And he will cheer you up!
谢谢你  菲比  我们一定会玩得很开心012---Thanks so much, Pheebs. We are gonna have so much fun!
没错  不是那种"开心"012---Yes, we are. Oh, not that kind of fun.
情人节快乐012---Happy Valentine's!
我马上出去012---I'll be right out.
我在穿一件不是很舒服的衣服012---I'm slipping into something a bit less comfortable
但却很放荡012---and a bit more slutty.
"糖果与饼干"012---"Candy and Cookie"?
"糖果与饼干"012---"Candy and Cookie"?!
莫妮卡帮我租了黄片012---Monica got me porn?
女同志的片子012---Girlongirl porn?!
她一定很爱我012---She really must love me!
好吧  放轻松012---Yeah, just relax.
我爱你  圣瓦伦丁012---I love you, St. Valentine.
这画面可不太雅观012---Whoa, whoa, that's not pretty.
用力012---Now push!
天啊  好痛012---Oh, God, it hurts!
这是我看过最难看的黄片012---Worst porn ever! Worst porn ever!
快停下来  我在试呢012--- Oh, make it stop!  I am trying!
接球  准备好了吗  去接球012---Get the ball. Ready? Get the ball!
你很可爱  但脑袋可不怎么灵光012---You're cute, but you're not too smart.
这是我刚刚扔的吗012---Did I just throw this?
我不小心把这些跟我的东西混在一起带走了012---I accidentally packed these with my stuff.
这是谁啊  菲比朋友的狗012--- Who is this?  That's Phoebe's friend's dog.
我不知道它叫什么名字  我叫它马苏里拉（奶酪）012---I don't know what his real name is. I call him Mozzarella.
你好可爱  我希望能留下来陪你玩012---You are so cute. I wish I could play with you more,
但我得去上班了012---but I've gotta go to work.
我希望开会的时候不会这样说话012---I hope I stop talking like this before my market meeting.
对  没错012---Yes, I do. Yes, I do.
再见  乔伊  说真的  我改不过来了012---Byebye, Joey. Seriously, I can't stop it.
过来012---Come here! Hey!
她是瑞秋  以前她住在这里012---That's Rachel. She's the one who used to live here.
老实跟你说  我们爱她012---Might as well be honest with you. We love her.
但我们不能拥有她012---But we can't have her.
我真的很想她012---I really miss her.
你应该了解吧  你是男生012---Hey, you understand, right? You're a guy.
你曾经是012---Well, you used to be.
你觉得怎样012---So, what do you think?
我还是很惹火012---I've still got it.
你为什么要给我租这个  那是什么012--- Why did you get me this?  What is it?
里面充斥着尖叫  鲜血跟阴道扩张012---It's yelling, bleeding, dilating.
阴道扩张012---Oh, the dilating!
这是纪录生产的录影带012---Is this the video of the baby being born?
这是菲比的  你为什么要看012---Sweetie, It's Phoebe's. Why were you watching it?
我还以为你在情人节帮我租了黄片012---I thought maybe you got me porn for Valentine's Day.
如果你以为我会在情人节帮你租黄片...012---Chandler, If you thought I was gonna get you porn for Valentine's Day...
那么你说对了012---...you were right.
片中的女主角012---Apparently It's about a young girl
跑到大都市来追寻星梦012---who moves to the city in search of stardom...
最后跟很多男人上了床012---...but ends up having sex with a lot of guys.
它有四星级的评价012---It got four stars.
等一下  那些不是星星012---Wait a minute. Those aren't stars.
你要看一下吗012---Anyway, you wanna take a look?
我现在非常没有性致012---I'm not really in a sexy mood right now.
发生了什么事012---Hey, what's going on?
还记得你第一次看大白鲨...012---Remember the first time you saw Jaws...
你花了多长时间才敢再下水游泳012---...how long it took to go back in the water?
我们不能让这卷录影带毁了情人节012---We can't let this tape wreck Valentine's Day.
你不了解情况  你又没看过012---Okay. You don't know. You didn't see it.
生孩子是很自然的一件事  过程很美012---Childbirth is a natural thing. It's beautiful.
很美  真的吗012---Oh, beautiful? Really?
你觉得这叫美吗012---Really? You think this is beautiful?
天啊  难怪我妈恨我012---Oh, my God! No wonder my mother hates me!
瞧  亲爱的  别碰我012--- See, honey, there's...  Don't touch me!
大西洋城好玩吗  很好玩012--- How was Atlantic City?  Good.
我帮你买了礼物012---I brought you back a present.
你用不着这么客气012---Come, on. You didn't have to...
盐水太纪糖012---Saltwater taffy?!
谢谢012---Thanks.
有意思的是012---You know, it's interesting,
多数人以为里面添加了海水012---most people think this is made with seawater.
但事实上它是用加盐淡水做的012---But it's actually made with salted fresh water.
这一点意思都没有012---That's not interesting.
我觉得很有意思啊  我也是  我想你012--- I think it's interesting.  I do too. I missed you!
我也是012---Me too.
这星期你过得如何  非常好012--- So how was your week?  Good.
宝宝开始会动了  太棒了012--- Actually, the baby started kicking.  How exciting!
太神奇了  只可惜012---Yeah. it was amazing. The only thing sad is,
第一次我并不在场012---I wasn't around when it happened for the first time.
不是吧  我还错过了不少别的事情012--- Oh, no.  Yeah. I was missing out on all this other stuff too.
所以乔伊建议瑞秋搬过来跟我住012---So Joey suggested Rachel move in with me.
想得美012---Yeah, right.
怎么了  乔伊害我笑得肚子痛012--- What?  Joey cracks me up.
"让你前妻搬去跟你住吧012---It's like, "Yeah, why don't you have your exwife move in with you?
那一点也不别扭"012---That wouldn't be awkward at all."
想像一下  我才离开了几天012---Can you imagine, I go away for a few days...
回来时却发现男友012---I come back and my boyfriend
跟怀了他孩子的女人同居了012---is living with some woman he got pregnant.
你怎么跟他说的012---So, what'd you tell him?
你怎么会没告诉蒙娜瑞秋搬过去了012---How could you not tell Mona that Rachel is living with you?
她似乎觉得这个想法很不可思议012---I don't know. She seemed to think it was such a crazy idea.
而且她送了我太纪糖012---Plus, she got me taffy.
真的吗  我从没吃过  从没吃过012--- Taffy? Really? I've never had any.  Ever?
我妈忙着计划自杀  没空买盐水零食给我012---My mom was too busy planning her suicide to provide saltwater treats.
谢谢012---Thank you.
你打算一直瞒着她吗012---So what, you're just never going to tell her?
不  我会说的  但得先哄哄她012---No, no, no. I will. I just want to butter her up first.
我要带她去吃一顿丰盛的情人节晚餐012---I'm going to take her to an amazing Valentine's dinner,
做一些浪漫的事012---do all this romantic stuff.
当她觉得我是有史以来最棒的男朋友时012---And then just when she thinks I'm the best boyfriend in the world,
我会告诉她  我怀孕的前女友跟我同居了012---then I'm gonna tell her my pregnant exgirlfriend is living with me.
或许我之前没提过  她是个非常幸运的女人012---If I haven't said it before, she's a lucky, lucky lady.
我们...这个玩意是怎么回事012---So where are...? What the mother of crap is up with this stuff?
到底是口香糖还是食物  能不能咽下去012---God, is it gum? Is it food? What's the deal?
好好吃  我能尝尝粉红色的吗012---Oh, it's nice. May I try a pink one?
她跟我是朋友012---So between her and me being friends,
还跟罗斯交往过...012---and her history with Ross...
这种事绝不能发生012---...it just isn't gonna happen.
那就像是你爱上了一只猫012---It'd be like you falling in love with a cat.
哥们  我最喜欢的狗怎么样了012---Buddy, how's my favorite dog, huh?
我最喜欢的狗怎么样了012---How's my favorite dog?
你好压抑012---You're subdued.
你给它喝啤酒了吗  没有012--- Did you give him a beer?  No.
请回避一下  我们需要谈谈012---Will you excuse us? We need to talk for a moment.
没问题012---Yeah, sure.
是我  好吧012---Oh, me, right.
它很难过  怎么回事  没事012--- He's miserable. What happened to him?  Nothing.
我们不过是聊了些事情  什么事012--- We just talked about stuff.  What stuff?
关于瑞秋的事012---Rachel stuff.
乔伊  你害得它都抑郁了012---Oh, Joey, you bummed him out!
这可是世上最开心乐观的狗012---This is the happiest dog in the world.
它才陪了你半天  瞧它现在012---And he spends half a day with you, and look at him!
它还在喘气012---He's breathing.
我要把它送回温蒂家012---Okay, I'm going to take him back to Wendy's.
别啊  它好着呢  你看012---No, no, no. He's fine. Look, look, look.
快接球012---Here's your ball! Get your ball!
去接球  去接球012---Get your ball! Get your ball! Get your ball!
去...012---Get...
天啊  我对你做了什么012---God, what have I done to you?
我害了这只狗  菲比  我把它整崩溃了012---I broke the dog, Pheebs! I broke the dog!
我要去接蒙娜  今晚你要做什么012---I'm going to pick up Mona. What have you got going tonight?
我有个很棒的情人节计划012---Oh, I got big Valentine's plans.
我订了中国菜012---I got my Chinese food on the way,
还有盐水太纪糖可以吃012---and the rest of your saltwater taffy.
有意思的是  多数人以为里面添加了海水012---It's interesting! Most people think that's made with seawater,
但事实上...  罗斯012--- when in fact...  Ross,
我们是一起看的那部纪录片012---we actually watched the documentary together.
我的外卖来了  我去拿钱012---Oh, my Chinese food. I'll get my cash.
蒙娜012---Mona?
你怎么... 嗨012---What are...? Hi!
你怎么自己来了  我应该去接你的012---What are you doing here? I'm supposed to pick you up.
计划有变  我帮你做了特制情人节晚餐012---Change of plans. I made you a special Valentine's dinner.
大惊喜012---Surprise!
蒙娜  嗨  瑞秋012--- Oh! Hey, Mona!  Hi, Rachel.
她在这里做什么012---What's she doing here?
我不知道啊012---I have no idea.
如果你们要找我  我在房里看电视012---I'll be watching TV if anybody needs me.
她到底在这里做什么012---Seriously, what is she doing?
最近  她喜欢待在这里012---Lately she just likes hanging out here.
为什么  我觉得她很寂寞012--- Why?  I think she's lonely.
但今天是情人节012---Okay, but it's Valentine's Day.
我知道  我们能请她离开吗012--- I know.  Can't we ask her to go?
不行  她情绪波动太大了012---Well, no, she's way too emotional.
其实我是说  她神经失常了012---And by emotional, I mean crazy!
别管我  我的外卖来了012---I'm not here. That's just my Chinese food.
天啊  她还把外卖叫到这里来了012---Oh, my god. She has food delivered here?
对  虽说她情绪起伏  但却精力充沛012---Yes, she's emotional, but ballsy.
知道我怎么打算的吗012---You know what I'm going to do?
我要去换上运动服  躺在床上吃饭012---I'm gonna get in my sweats and eat this in bed.
你还以为她会妨碍到我们呢012---And you thought she was gonna be in our way!
你把香槟打开012---So, okay. Why don't you open the champagne,
我马上回来  我有个大惊喜给你012---and I will be right back. I've got a surprise for you.
你还有别的前妻也藏在里面吗012---You got another exwife back there?
请开始喝香槟吧012---Please start drinking.
我只是来拿电话  瑞秋  等一下012--- I'm just gonna grab the phone.  Rachel, wait.
我希望你不要误会012---I hope you don't take this the wrong way.
可你这是在干嘛012---But, what are you doing?
抱歉  你要用电话吗012---Sorry, do you need the phone?
不012---No, no.
罗斯太好心  没办法说出口012---Listen, Ross is too nice to say anything,
但这是他的公寓012---but this is his apartment.
我们需要隐私012---and, we gotta have some boundaries,
你为什么不回你家  给我们留点隐私呢012---so why don't you go back to your place and give us some privacy?
蒙娜  我住在这里012---But, Mona, I live here.
情人节快乐012---Happy Valentine's Day!
这也可以作为分手礼物012---Or, something to remember me by.
这次是多久  九十秒012--- How long has it been this time?  90 seconds.
有进步012---That's better.
九十秒没去想那个场景  已经很久了012---Ninety seconds is a long time not to think about it.
但其实我满脑子全是那些画面012---Except all I did was think about it.
我知道  我也忘不了012---I know. It haunts me.
我之前见识过最不堪入目的事012---Up till now, the worst thing I ever saw,
是我爸跟脱光的男仆把酒言欢012---was my father doing tequila shots off the naked houseboy.
看完这个  我甚至乐意把他们的照片做成屏保012---After this, I would gladly make that my screen saver.
我们得忘了这件事012---We have to get past this.
我们把录像带扔掉  假装不存在012---Why don't we get rid of the tape and pretend it never existed?
这点我能做到  好012--- I could do that.  Okay.
现在我们只要丢掉这张椅子就行012---Okay. Now all we gotta do is get rid of this chair.
谢天谢地  可不是嘛012--- Oh, thank God!  I know.
请进012---Come in!
抱歉破坏了你们的情人节012---Hi. I'm so sorry to barge in on your Valentine, but...
但我实在受不了他们吵来吵去012---I had to get away from the yelling.
蒙娜要跟罗斯分手012---Mona's dumping Ross.
天啊  可怜的罗斯012--- Oh, my God.  Poor Ross.
平时我们得看他穿内裤做瑜伽012---Great, we have to watch him do yoga in his underwear,
结果现在他却把窗帘拉上了012---but for this he closes the drapes.
瑞秋  关于你想看的那卷生产录影带012---Rach, you know that birthing tape you wanted to see?
在我这里012---It's here.
我们得在你看之前警告你012---We should warn you before you watch it.
千万别看012---Don't watch it.
你们看过了  很可怕吗012---You saw it? Is it scary?
讽刺的是  "生"孩子的画面012---Well, let's just say that it's ironic how footage
让人很想去"死"012---of someone being born can make you want to kill yourself.
现在我被吓住了  你们能跟我一起看吗012---Now I'm all freaked out. Come on, will you watch it with me?
不行  但我会把有我体味的毛衣012---No, but I'll leave a sweater that smells like me
放在你旁边012---right next to you.
说真的  你们不能让我一个人看这种东西012---Seriously, you guys, you're not gonna make me watch this alone.
她说得对  当然不行012---She's right. Of course not.
亲爱的  去拿录影带012---Honey, get the tape.
这个动作我想起了录影带里的某一段内容012---This reminds me of a very specific part of the tape.
来吧012---Here we go.
好吧012---Okay.
天啊012---Oh, my.
加油  为什么宝宝要折磨那个女人012--- Come on, come on.  Why is that baby torturing that woman?
为什么这种玩意我要连看三次012---Why have I seen this thing three times?
但还是很美好啊012---It's still beautiful.
好可怕012---It's horrible!
我知道  我为你感到难过  天啊012--- I know, I know! I'm so sorry for you!  Oh, my god.
你们快看   怎么  她屁股爆炸了吗012---You guys! You guys, look!  What? Did her ass explode?
不  宝宝出来了  你们看012---No, the baby's out. Look, look.
看看那些小手指跟小脚趾012---Look at those little fingers and toes.
看看妈妈现在有多高兴012---Look how happy the mom is now.
瑞秋  去你们的012--- Oh, Rach.  Screw you guys!
要生孩子的又不是你们012---You don't have to do it!
怎么了  蒙娜刚刚甩了我012--- What's up?  Mona just dumped me.
天啊  我很遗憾  为什么012---Oh, man, I'm sorry. Why?
从我最近的种种表现来看012---Well, with everything that's been going on lately,
我算不上个称职的男友012---I haven't exactly been the perfect boyfriend.
我没有告诉她  我让瑞秋怀孕了012---I didn't tell her I got Rachel pregnant.
我给了她我家的钥匙  然后换了锁012---I gave her a key to my apartment and then had the locks changed.
关于瑞秋搬到我家的事  我跟她撒了谎012---Then I lied to her about Rachel moving in with me.
其实  我想怪她不早点跟我分手012---In a way, I judge her for not breaking up with me sooner.
这打击太大了012---That really sucks, man.
特别是在情人节  是啊012--- Especially on Valentine's Day.  Yeah.
等一下  你在这里做什么012---Wait a minute. What are you doing here?
乔伊·崔比安尼在情人节却没有约会012---Joey Tribbiani without a date on Valentine's Day?
发生了什么事  遇上感情困扰了吗012---What's going on, huh? Girl trouble?
可以那么说  真的吗012--- Sort of.  Really?
你不必表现得这么高兴012---You don't have to seem so happy about it.
抱歉  或许我能帮忙012---Sorry. Maybe I can help.
不论发生了什么事  我相信我也有相同的经验012---Whatever it is, I am sure it has happened to me.
事实上 我有次在做爱过程中被甩了012---You know, actually, once I got dumped during sex.
到底发生了什么事012---So anyway, what is it?
算了  没什么大不了的012---Forget about it. It's no big deal.
少来了  怎么了  没事012--- Come on, Joey, what is it?  It's nothing.
