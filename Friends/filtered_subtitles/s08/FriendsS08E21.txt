伙计们  有个坏消息  什么012--- Hey, you guys. I got some bad news.  What?
这样怎么卖得出去报纸012---That's no way to sell newspapers.
试试"号外  号外  快来买啊"012---Try, "Extra! Extra! Read all about it!"
不  莫妮卡的餐厅在纽约邮报上的评价很差012---No. Monica's restaurant got a horrible review in the Post.
我不希望她看到012---I didn't want her to see it,
所以跑遍附近报摊买下了所有报纸012---so I ran around and bought all the copies I could find.
确实很糟糕  我一直都被批得很凶012---This is bad. And I've had my bad share of bad reviews.

都很差劲012---was simply terrible.

我的天啊012---Oh, dear God.

没有所谓的负面报导012---there's no such thing as bad press.
你不觉得"主厨做的鬼头刀难吃极了"012---You don't think that umm, "The chef's Mahi Mahi was awful awful,"
是负面报导吗012---is bad press?
那又不是我写的012---I didn't write it.
天啊  他说得对吗  我很逊吗   不012--- God, is he right? Am I awful?  Oh, no!
莫妮卡  听我说012---Monica, you listen to me, okay?
我这么说不是因为我是你朋友012---I'm not just saying this because I'm your friend.
而是因为这是事实012---I'm saying it 'cause it's the truth.
你的菜品无可救药012---Your food is abysmal!

我要报复他012---I'm getting my revenge.
你把他煮了012---You cooked him?
不  他在新校开了一堂美食鉴赏课012---No. He teaches a course on food criticism at the New School,
