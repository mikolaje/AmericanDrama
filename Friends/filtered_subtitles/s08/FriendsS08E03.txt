对  祝你们蜜月玩得愉快012---Yeah. Have a great honeymoon.
谢谢  我最好去打包行李012--- Thanks.  I better go pack.
不  我已经打好包了012---No, I already packed.
我只是找不到你的迷你泳裤了012---The only thing I couldn't find, though, was your Speedo.
我没有迷你泳裤012---Speedo? I don't have a Speedo.
我要去打包我那条普通的超长泳裤012---I'm gonna go pack my regular, long bathing suit.
很好  你还在012---Good, you're still here!
我想来祝你有个愉快的蜜月012---I wanted to tell you to have a good honeymoon.
谢谢012---Thank you!
我还要你们知道012---And I also wanted you guys to know that
今天我会告诉孩子他爸012---I am telling the father today.
怎么了012---What? What? What?
我们知道孩子他爸是罗斯012---We know it's Ross.
你怎么知道的012---How? How do you know?
那是他的毛衣  我们都又惊又喜012---It was his sweater. But, oh, my God!
我好希望罗斯是第一个知道的012---I so wanted Ross to know first.
但你们知道了  我真的松了一口气012---But I am so relieved that you guys know!
这真的是太棒了012---That is so great.
我要当姑姑了  我知道012--- And I'm gonna be your baby's aunt!  I know.
我要当阿姨了012---Me too!
我要当叔叔了  来吧012---And I'm gonna be an uncle! Come here.
你们要当孩子的姑姑  阿姨跟叔叔了012---You're all gonna be aunts and uncles.
对  但只有我跟孩子有血缘关系012---Yeah, but I'm the only one related by blood.
现在你们知道了  你们可以帮我012---Great! So now that you all know, you can help me.
建议我该怎么跟罗斯说012---Give me some advice on how to I'm gonna tell Ross.
你打算怎么说012---What were you gonna say?
我要告诉他我想留下孩子012---I was gonna tell him that I'm gonna have the baby,
他想怎么做都可以012---and he can be as involved as he wants.
听起来很不错012---Well, that sounds good.
对  但我该怎么开口呢012---Yeah, but, you know, how do I start?
我是说我的开场白应该是什么012---I mean, what's the first thing that I say?
好吧  太棒了  谢谢012---Okay, great. Thanks.
祝你好运   再见012--- Hey, good luck.  Yeah, bye.
刚才是怎么一回事012---Hey, what was that all about?
看来现在告诉你也没关系了012---Well, I guess there's no harm in telling you now.
瑞秋怀了罗斯的孩子012---Rachel and Ross are going to have a baby.
什么012---What?!
我完全不知道  你为什么不告诉我012---I didn't even know that...!Why didn't you tell me?
我为什么会这用这种声音说话012---Why am I talking like this?
我觉得你藏不住秘密012---I didn't think you could keep it a secret.
什么012---What?!
我的嘴可严了012---I am an excellent secretkeeper.
我一直保守着我们所有的秘密012---I have kept all our secrets.
什么秘密  不  乔伊012--- What secrets?  No, no, Joey.
我不会告诉你  因为我的嘴很严012---I'm not gonna tell you, because I am an excellent secretkeeper.
待会你会告诉我  你已经知道了012--- You'll tell me later?  You already know.
《老友记》  第八季  第3集  瑞秋告诉了罗斯012---Friends S08E03 The One Where Rachel Tells…
送别人去度蜜月  真的好浪漫012---It's so romantic to send people off on their honeymoon.
莫妮卡跟钱德勒结婚了012---You know, Monica and Chandler are married.
罗斯跟瑞秋就要生宝宝了012---Ross and Rachel are having a baby.
或许你跟我也该找些事来做012---Maybe you and I should do something.
别急  吾爱  等到合适的时机吧012---All in good time, my love. All in good time.
该死  我把吉他放在他们家了012---Shoot! I left my guitar in their apartment.
你待会能帮我开门吧012---Well, you can let me in later, right?
不行  我没有钥匙012---No, I don't have a key.
他们拿走我的钥匙说是要交给你012---They took mine to give to you.
什么  他们拿走我的说是要交给你012---What? They took mine to give to you.
他们为什么要拿走我们的钥匙012---Why would they take away our keys?
或许他们不信任我们012---Maybe they don't trust us.
不对啊  他们上次出城时012---That's not it. They let me keep my key
还让我帮他们保管钥匙012---the last time they were out of town.
那次你打破番茄酱瓶012---You mean the time you broke the ketchup bottle
拿莫妮卡给客人准备的毛巾来清理012---and cleaned it with Monica's guest towels?
我洗了毛巾  才没有012--- Hey, I washed those.  No, you didn't.
对  那听起来不像我的作风012---Yeah, that didn't sound like me.
我该怎么办  我真的要用吉他012---What am I gonna do? I really need my guitar.
我也有东西放在他们家012---I have stuff in there too.
什么东西  莫妮卡的奶酪鸡排012--- What stuff?  Monica's chicken parm.
我来想办法解决012---I'll take care of it.
崔格先生  我是乔伊·崔比安尼012---Hey, Mr. Treeger? It's Joey Tribbiani.
听着  我得去莫妮卡跟钱德勒家012---Listen, I need to get into Monica and Chandler's apartment.
有紧急事件012---It's an emergency!
煤气泄漏  带大蒜面包过来012---Gas leak. Oh, and bring garlic bread.
瑞秋找到你了吗  没有  怎么了012--- Did Rachel find you?  No, why?
她在找你012---She was looking for you.
那我待会再见她012---Well, I guess I'll catch up with her later.
她真的得马上跟你谈012---She really wanted to talk to you now.
对  似乎是有重要的事012---Yeah, it seemed pretty important.
不012---Oh, no.
怎么012---What?
我想我知道她要跟我谈什么了012---I think I might know what this is about.
真的吗012---Really?
对012---Yeah.
我们答应不会告诉任何人  但是...012---We promised we weren't gonna tell anybody this, but...
大约一个月前瑞秋跟我上床了012---About a month ago, Rachel and I slept together.
结果呢012---And?
我以为你们会大吃一惊012---Wow, I thought you'd be a little more shocked.
抱歉  结果呢012---Oh, sorry. And?!
我们说只做一次...012---Well, we said we'd just do it that one time...
我想她现在或许想要跟我复合012---...but now I think she may wanna start things up again.
我想不是那样的012---Yeah, I don't think that's what it is.
怎么  不然会是什么事012---Why? What else could it be?
我觉得不太舒服012---Oh, wow, I don't feel well.
我觉得就是那么一回事012---I'm telling you, I'm telling you, that's what it is.
难怪在婚礼上  她看我的眼神怪怪的012---No wonder she was looking at me all funny during the wedding.
她什么都没有告诉你们吗012---She didn't say anything to you?
或许你吃错东西了  有可能012--- Maybe it's something you ate.  Could be, yeah.
拜托  去跟瑞秋谈一谈  好吧012--- Please, just go and talk to Rachel.  Yeah, I guess I should.
你们知道我领悟到什么事吗012---Man, you know what I have to realize?
或许我是那种让女人一夜难忘的男人012---Maybe I'm not the type of guy women can have just one night with.
她们对我永远都觉得不满足012---You know, they always seem to want a little bit more.
我应该记住那一点012---I should remember that.
下一位012---Next.
他们在接吻  我们先过去吧012---They're kissing. Let's just go around them.
别打扰他们  他们深爱彼此012---Honey, leave them alone. They're in love.
我也爱你  不过爱得井然有序012---I'm in love too. But in an orderly fashion.
下一位012---Next.
你们能边走边接吻吗012---Hi. Can you do that and walk?
她说"下一位"了012---Because she said, "Next."
抱歉  我们没有听到012---Sorry, we didn't hear you.
我们要去度蜜月012---We're on our honeymoon.
让我来看一下012---Let me see what I can do.
头等舱还有位置012---There are some firstclass seats available.
你听到没有012---Did you hear that?
她让他们升级到头等舱012---They bumped them up to first class
因为他们要去度蜜月012---because they're on their honeymoon!
我们假装也要去度蜜月012---Come on. Let's act like we're on our honeymoon.
我们的确是要去度蜜月012---We are on our honeymoon.
快摸我屁股012---Grab my ass.
下一位  抱歉  我差点没听见012--- Next.  Hi. Sorry, I almost didn't hear you,
我深爱我的新婚丈夫012---because, you know, I'm just so in love with my new husband.
我们要去度蜜月012---We're on our honeymoon.
恭喜  谢谢012--- Congratulations.  Thanks.
好了  宾先生  你在25J012---Okay, Mr. Bing, you'll be in 25J,
宾太太是25K012---and Mrs. Bing, you're in 25K.
我们要去度蜜月012---We're on our honeymoon,
你能让我们升级到头等舱吗012---so can you do your little thing and bump us to first class?
抱歉  头等舱客满了012---I'm sorry, all the firstclass seats are taken.
刚刚那对夫妻拿走最后两个位置012---That couple got the last two.
看吧  如果你听我的话  插他们的队012---See? If we'd gone around them like I said,
她会给我们头等舱的位置  该死012---she'd have given us those tickets! Damn it!
25J跟K会不会刚好不连在一起012---25J and K, any chance those aren't together?
我还是不敢相信他们拿走了我的钥匙012---I still can't believe they took away my key.
你都把你的钥匙交给我保管012---I mean, you trust me with yours.
那当然  等清理钥匙的人把它擦干挣之后012---Of course I do! And I'm gonna get it back to you just as soon as
我就会还给你012---they're done with it at the keyshining place.
那是什么声音  我不知道012--- What the hell is that?  I don't know.
崔格  你在做什么012---Treeger, what are you doing?
你说有煤气泄漏012---You said there was a gas leak in here.
你为什么不用钥匙开门012---Why not use your key?
等我找到他们家的钥匙012---Because by the time I found it on this thing,
这间公寓可能都炸掉了012---the whole place might have exploded.
如果我管理的公寓再发生一次爆炸意外012---If that happens at another building I manage,
人们会开始问问题012---people will ask questions.
快一点012---Come on, hurry up!
要那么做我们也会012---Well, we could have done that.
你看  他们走进头等舱休息室了012---Look at that! They're going into the firstclass lounge.
你知道里面有什么吗  不知道012--- Do you know what they have in there?  No.
我也不知道  我们得进去才行012---Me neither. We have to get in!
装做你是头等舱的客人  天啊  有橘子012--- Just act like you belong.  Oh, my God! Oranges!
很高兴又跟你见面了012---Nice to see you again.
先生  麻烦出示你的机票012---Sir, may I see your tickets, please?
没问题012---Yes, of course.
抱歉  麻烦将你的姆指挪开012---I'm sorry. Would you move your thumb?
我看不到座位号码012---I can't see the seat number.
没关系  我已经背下来了  是1A012---That's all right. I have it memorized. It's 1 A.
这不是头等舱的机票  抱歉012---Sir, this isn't a firstclass ticket. I'm sorry.
没关系  不好意思012---Apology accepted. Excuse us.
先生  恐怕我得请你们离开012---Sir, I'm afraid I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.
好吧012---Fine.
快跑012---Go, go, go!
我想我们真的需要好好谈一谈012---I think there's something that we really need to talk about.
没错  我们先进去吧012---I think we do. Why don't we go inside.
我知道你为什么会来找我  真的吗012--- Look, I know why you're here.  You do?
对  为了让你别太尴尬012---Yeah, and to save you from any embarrassment...
我想或许应该我先说012---...I think maybe I should talk first.
好吧  好吗012--- Okay.  Okay?
罗斯跟瑞秋012---Ross and Rachel.
瑞秋跟罗斯012---Rachel and Ross.
很像是在玩跷跷板  对吧012---That's been one heck of a seesaw, hasn't it?
什么012---What?
我是说那晚012---I mean, look, that one night
我们过得既满足又尽性012---we had was fun and certainly passionate.
但你不觉得我们还是当朋友比较好吗012---But don't you think it's better if we just stay friends?
你是说...什么012---Seriously, what?
好吧  这样好了012---Okay, okay. You know what?
如果你想的话  我们可以再做一次012---If you want to, we can do it one more time.
我没有问题012---I mean, I'd be okay with that.
事实上我现在有空012---In fact, I have some time right now...
好了012---Okay.
你知道吗  我可以说话了吗012---You know what? Can I talk now?
当然可以 好吧012--- Oh, sure.  Okay.
我怀孕了012---I'm pregnant.
罗斯012---Ross?
罗斯012---Ross?
好吧  我等你准备好再说012---Okay, whenever you're ready.
对了  你是孩子他爸  你继续012---And you're the father, by the way. But you got...
你要喝水吗  我没事012--- Can I get you some water?  I'm good. I'm good.
罗斯  别觉得有什么压力  好吗012---Ross, there is no pressure on you, okay?
你想怎么做都可以的012---I mean, you can be as involved as you want.
对  我...012---Yeah, I...
我只是不知道... 我不明白...012---I'm just, I don't know. I don't understand...
怎么会发生这种事012---...how this happened.
我们有用安全套  我知道012--- We used a condom.  I know.
但安全套的避孕率只有97%012---But you know, condoms only work, like, 97 percent of the time.
什么012---What?
什么012---What?!
他们应该标示在包装上012---Well, they should put that on the box!
包装上有标示  才没有012--- They do.  No, they don't!
他们应该用又大又粗的字体标示在包装上012---Well, they should put it in huge block letters!
罗斯  别管安全套的事012---Ross, let's just forget about the condoms.
早知道当时也不用管了012---Well, I may as well have!
你知道吗  我发现自己怀孕时...012---Listen, you know what? I was really freaked out too...
也吓坏了  吓坏了  我才没有012---...when I found out.  Freaked...?Hey, I'm not freaked out.
作为消费者  我很愤怒012---I'm indignant as a consumer!
你知道吗  我们待会再谈012---You know what? Let's talk later.
不  我想现在谈012---No, I wanna talk now.
事实上我想...012---In fact, I wanna talk...
跟安全套公司的总裁谈012---...to the president of the condom company.
或许我该待会再来  好吧012---Okay, you know what? Maybe I should come back... Okay.
好吧  我按一012---Yeah, I'll press one!
我到处都检查过  没有煤气泄漏012---I looked everywhere. There's no gas leak.
我可以热一下这个吗012---So then I can heat this up?
总之我会帮他装扇新门012---Anyway, I'll get moving on that new door.
太棒了  你能帮我们一个忙012---Great. Listen, could you do us a favor
别跟钱德勒和莫妮卡提这件事吗012---and not tell Chandler and Monica about this?
因为他们没有自己的孩子...012---Because, you know, they don't have any kids of their own...
这扇门就像是他们的孩子012---...and this door was like a child to them.
我得装上新锁012---Well, I'm gonna have to put on a new lock.
他们一定会发现的012---They'll find out anyway.
不是吧012---Oh, no.
看样子要干一整天012---It's looking like an allday job.
我得去取消我的瑜伽课012---I'm gonna have to cancel my yoga class.
罗斯  麻烦你告诉茉莉012---Hey, Ross. Could you tell Jasmine
今天我没办法去上瑜伽课  没问题012--- I can't make it to yoga class today?  Sure.
再见  再见012--- Namaste.  Namaste.
天啊  门是怎么了012---Oh, my God! What happened to the door?
看来很明显012---So it's noticeable, huh?
瑞秋在这里吗  我得跟她谈一谈012---Look, is Rachel here? I need to talk to her.
你们不是谈过了吗012---Didn't you two already talk?
对  但是012---Yeah, but...
听着  你们知道  瑞秋跟我上过床012---Okay. Look, you guys know that Rachel and I slept together...
但除此之外还有别的事012---...but there's something else.
瑞秋怀孕了012---Rachel's pregnant.
我的老天爷  天啊  我不敢相信012--- Holy mother of God!  Oh, my God, I can't believe that!
她怀了我的孩子  我是第一次听到这件事012--- With my child.  That is brandnew information!
你们已经知道了对不对  知道一点012--- You already know, don't you?  Little bit.
你还好吗  我会没事的012--- How you doing?  Okay. I mean, I'll be okay.
我觉得自己处理得不够好012---It's just, I don't think I handled it very well.
你跟她说了什么  什么都没说012--- What'd you say to her?  Nothing.
但我跟安全套公司的客服部门倒是说了不少012---But the complaint department at the condom company got an earful.
我一转身才发现她走了  罗斯012--- Then when I turned around, she was gone.  Oh, Ross.
我知道  但我刚刚才发现012---I know. But in my defense,
安全套只有97%的避孕率012---I just found out that condoms are only, like, 97% effective.
什么  我得去找她012--- What?  I gotta go find her.
等一下  你是认真的吗012---Hey. Hold on! Are you serious?
所以安全套有3%的机率不起作用012---So, like, 3 percent of the time, they don't even work?
他们应该在包装上做标示012---They should put that on the box!
他们的确做了标示  什么012--- Evidently, they do.  What?!
我不敢相信我们到这里了012---I can't believe we're here.
开什么玩笑  怎么012--- You've gotta be kidding.  What?
为了庆祝你们新婚012---As a wedding gift to you,
酒店要帮你们升级到蜜月套房012---the hotel would like to give you the honeymoon suite.
不  你们一整天都跟我们过不去012---No! You have been screwing us all day!
你们是谁  我们就是你们012--- Who are you?  We're you.
只是迟了十秒钟012---Just 10 seconds later!
你们已经抢走头等舱的位置和休息室012---You already got the firstclass tickets, you got the lounge.
我们也应该得到免费招待012---We should get free stuff too!
不光是你们在度蜜月012---You're not the only ones on your honeymoon!
我们可以把蜜月套房让给你们012---You can have the suite if you want.
我们不在乎要睡在哪里012---We don't care about where we stay.
我们来这里纪念我们对彼此的爱012---We're here to celebrate our love for each other.
我们不需要免费招待012---We don't have to get free stuff.
我们只想在一起012---We just want to be together.
我们需要免费招待012---We need the stuff.
莫妮卡  我是乔伊012---Monica, it's Joey. Listen.
菲比跟我闻到你家有煤气味012---Phoebe and I smell gas coming from your apartment.
什么  真的吗  乔伊闻到有煤气味012---What? Are you serious? Joey smells gas.
还有什么新消息012---What else is new?
我们想进去看看  但你拿走了我们的钥匙012---We'd check it out, but you took our keys.
快想办法进去012---Well, do something. Get in there!
要怎么办呢  我可以把你家大门撞开012---How? I guess I could break down your door.
对  就那么做012---Yeah, do that.
你不会怪我们弄坏东西  不会012--- And you won't blame us for any damage?  No.
你在撞门了吗  我没有听到声音  快呀012---Are you doing it? I don't hear anything. Come on.
好吧  我来撞门了012---Okay, I'll break it down.
他正在撞门  他要把门撞开了012---Hi. He's doing it, he's breaking down the door.
好了  我们进来了012---Okay, we're in.
瑞秋  你感觉舒服吗012---Okay, Rachel, are you comfortable?
如果我说很舒服  你会另眼看我吗012---If I said I was, would you judge me?
医生马上过来帮你照超声波012---The doctor'll be here in a minute to do your sonogram.
好的012---Okay.
天啊  我发誓  如果他们在家具店卖这个012---Oh, man, I swear, if they sold these at Pottery Barn...
我们得谈一谈012---We need to talk.
现在吗  我现在的姿势有点不雅012---Right now? Because I kind of got an alfresco situation going on over here.
拜托  我真的...012---Please, I really...
我想为我刚刚的表现向你道歉012---I want to apologize for the way I acted earlier today.
没关系  麻烦你待在床头边012---Okay, Ross. That's fine. Can you stay up near my head?
什么  抱歉012---What? Oh, yeah, sorry.
我被冲昏头了  我只想到自己012---I think I went a little crazy. I was thinking about myself
我应该要为你着想012---when I should've been thinking about you...
没关系  待在床头这边  罗斯  好012--- Okay, head, Ross! Head, Ross!  Right.
我要你知道012---I want you to know that
我会一直陪在你身边  好吗012---I'm gonna be there through this whole thing. Okay?
来做产检  上拉梅兹呼吸课012---The doctor's appointments, the Lamaze classes,
在公寓里为宝宝安装保护措施012---babyproofing the apartment.
但我们可以等到婚后再担心那些事012---Although, we can worry about that after we get married.
婚后  对  我想我们应该结婚012--- Married?  Well, yeah, I think we should get married.
你一遇到问题就用结婚来解决吗012---Because that's your answer to everything?
不  那么做是对的012---No. Because that's the right thing to do.
或许吧  只要我们相爱012---Yeah, maybe, if you're in love.
可是罗斯  我们并不相爱  对吧012---But Ross, we are not in love, are we?
