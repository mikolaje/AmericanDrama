这是三分熟  这是五分熟  快去上菜012---This one's rare. This one's mediumwell. Go, go, go!
菲比  晚餐好吃吗012---Hey, Phoebe! How was dinner?!
晚餐很好吃  我只是来打招呼  我要走了012---Dinner was good! Just saying hi! Now I'm gonna go!
你好啊012---Well, hello there.
我在菜单上没看到这道美味012---I didn't see this on the menu.
提姆  她是菲比012---Tim, this is Phoebe.
菲比  他是新来的副厨师长提姆012---Phoebe, this is Tim, my new sous chef.
你是莫妮卡的老板  不  她是我的老板012--- So you're Monica's boss?  No, she's my boss.
"副"在法文里是"之下"的意思012---"Sous" is French for "under."
我副（明）白了012---I "sousstand."
提姆  我要一份乌贼跟一份凯撒沙拉012---Tim, I need a calamari and a caesar salad.
你可以把青酱递给我吗012---And could you get me the pesto?
青酱是你做的吗  没错012--- You made pesto?  Yes, I did.
你觉得你的青酱是最"棒"的吗012---Would you say your pesto is the besto?
我不知道  我会说它真的很"强"012---I don't know. I would say it's pretty goodo.
别忘了给我拿乌贼跟沙拉012---I still need the calamari and salad.
我喜欢你的项链012---I like your necklace.
这是我自己做的  你真的好有天份012--- I made it myself.  You are so talented.
还是不够"酱"012---Well, it's no pesto.
我们就别兜圈子了012---Alright, alright. Let's just cut to the chase.
你是单身  你也单身012---Okay. You're single. You're single.
他11点下班  她会等你的电话012---He gets off work at 11. She'll be waiting for your call.
我会把你的电话号码给他012---I'll give him your number if I could just get
只要你给我乌贼跟凯撒沙拉012---one calamari and one caesar salad!
我没有大叫  我不必被罚一块钱012---I did not yell. I am not putting a dollar in the jar.
《老友记》  第八季  第5集  瑞秋的约会012---Friends S08E05 The One With Rachel's Date
宾  你还在熬夜加班012---Wow, Bing! Burning the midnight oil.
你很了解我的  老板012---You know me, sir.
我正好有个问题问你012---I do have a question for you.
你知道要怎么避开公司的电脑网路012---Do you know how I can get around the office computer network...
看劲爆火辣的国际黄片吗012---...so I can access the really good Internet porn?
你真爱开玩笑  宾012---You're a joker, Bing.
那有什么好笑的012---What's funny about that?
抱歉让你等这么久012---Sorry I kept you waiting so long.
没关系  你想去哪里012---That's okay. Where do you wanna go?
我以为你知道我要去哪里012---I think you know where I wanna go.
硬石餐厅  对012--- The Hard Rock Cafe?  Yeah.
又要去  对012--- Again?  Yeah.
我真的很喜欢那里的食物012---I'm telling you, I like the food.
你是喜欢那里的紫雨展示品012---You like the Purple Rain display.
巴伯  托比  祝你今晚玩得开心012--- Hey, Bob.  Hey, Toby. Have a good night.
那家伙叫你托比012---Did that guy just call you Toby?
对  他以为那是我的名字012---Yeah, he thinks that's my name.
你为什么不更正他012---Why don't you correct him?
现在纠正有点太晚了012---It's been going on way too long now.
他第一次这么叫我  我们只是在走廊擦肩而过012---The first time he said it, we were just passing each other in the hallway,
所以我什么都没说012---so I didn't say anything.
第二次他说"托比  你要吃甜甜圈吗"012---The next time he said, "Hey, Toby, want a doughnut?"
我确实想吃甜甜圈012---I wanted the doughnut.
五年后甜甜圈早就消化光了 我还是托比012---Five years later, the doughnut's gone and I'm still Toby.
五年了  钱德勒  你得告诉他012---Five years. Chandler, you have to tell him.
不行  那多尴尬啊012---No. That would be so awkward.
再说  我们不在同一个楼层工作  他在六楼012---Besides, we don't work together. He's on the sixth floor.
他只是偶尔才会叫我一次托比  没什么012---So he calls me Toby once in a while. What's the big deal?
这已经算不错了  反正他不是叫我妙丽012---It could be worse. It's not like he's calling me Muriel.
妙丽  他为什么要叫你妙丽012---Muriel. Why would he call you Muriel?
天啊012---Oh, my God.
钱德勒·M·宾012---Chandler "M." Bing.
那不仅是个M  你的中间名是妙丽012---It's not just an "M." Your middle name is Muriel!
那是家族名字012---It is a family name.
钱德勒·妙丽·宾012---Chandler Muriel Bing.
你父母真是完全不给你留活路  对吧012---Your parents never even gave you a chance, did they?
德瑞克  我找出你丧失记忆的原因了012---Drake, I've discovered the reason for your memory loss.
为什么012---What is it?
你的脑部移植手术并未完全成功012---Apparently your brain transplant was not entirely successful.
你的身体在排斥洁西卡的脑部012---It seems your body's rejecting Jessica's brain.
很严重吗012---Is it serious?
如果我们可以从捐赠者的身体抽取组织...012---Not if we extract tissue from the original body...
合成抗体  将其导入你体内012---...and synthesize antibodies and introduce them to your system
以此来解除排异效应012---which could stop you from rejecting the brain.
听起来很简单  我们就按你说的做吧012---That sounds simple enough. Let's just do that.
我们可以那么做012---We would,
但我们想挖出洁西卡的尸体时012---but when we went to exhume Jessica's body...
发现它不见了012---...it was gone.
卡012---Cut.
非常不错  大伙们012---Very nice, people.
我换好衣服后  我们就可以去吃晚餐了012---Okay, let me just get changed and we can go to dinner.
洁西卡的尸体怎么了012---What happened to Jessica's body?
我不能剧透  你得看电视才会知道012---I'm not telling you. You'll have to see it on TV.
你不知道  对吧  对  我也不在乎012--- You don't know, do you?  No. couldn't care less.
你表现得很好  你也是012--- Good scene, man.  You too.
怎么  你根本不是演员012---What? You weren't in it.
凯许  她是我朋友瑞秋012---Kash, this is my friend Rachel.
二位互相认识一下012---Rachel, Kash. Kash, Rachel.
为什么之前我没有见过你012---Why haven't I seen you here before?
乔伊觉得我会丢他的脸012---Joey just thinks I'll embarrass him.
他认为我是肥皂剧脑残粉012---He thinks I'm a soap opera nut.
我才不是  真的012---Which I'm not. I'm not.
虽然我的确知道012---Although, I do know
你最喜欢胡桃奶油口味的冰淇淋012---your favorite ice cream flavor is butter pecan.
你的狗叫华利012---And your dog's name is Wally.
天啊  我在摸你的胳膊  我们走吧012--- Look, I'm just stroking your arm.  Here we go. Here we go.
再见  凯许  再见012--- Bye, Kash.  Bye.
帮我跟华利问好012---Say hi to Wally.
莫妮卡012---Monica.
昨晚我跟提姆玩得很开心012---Oh, my god. I had the best time with Tim last night.
他真的很体贴012---He is so sweet.
我等不及钻到他的身体"下"面去012---I can't wait to get "sousneath" him.
我得开除他  为什么012--- I have to fire him.  Why?
他很不称职  动作超慢  还会把食物烧焦012---He's terrible. He's slow. He burns things.
昨晚他还把我的甜点主厨烧着了012---Last night he lit my pastry chef on fire.
他可能是太紧张了  你老是凶巴巴的012---Maybe he was just nervous. You can be intimidating.
我见过你的甜点主厨012---Besides,  I've met your pastry chef,
她牛哄哄的  也该灭灭她的威风了012---and she can stand to be taken down a peg or two.
现在她没有眉毛了  任务完成012---Well, now she has no eyebrows. Mission accomplished.
莫妮卡  他热爱他的工作012---But, Monica, he loves his job so much.
你不能再给他一次机会吗  拜托012---Can't you just give him another chance, please?
好吧  但如果他再放火烧别人  他非走不可012---All right. But if he lights someone else on fire, he's out of there.
那很公平  谢谢你012---That's fair. Thank you so much. Thanks.
看起来他烧甜点主厨的时候012---Oops. Looks like when he got the pastry chef,
也烧到你了012---he got you a little bit too.
我这是花钱去做的头发012---I paid to have this done.
我喜欢012---Love it!
知道吗  凯许真的喜欢你012---Hey. You know, Kash really liked you the other day.
他觉得你很迷人012---He said he thought you were charming.
我以为自己蠢到家了  我站在你这边012--- I thought I was a complete idiot.  I'm with you.
他还问我你会不会愿意跟他约会012---He even asked me if I thought you'd go out with him.
我感觉快要吐了012---I think I'm gonna throw up a little.
你怎么说  我说不会012--- What did you say?  I said, "No."
什么012---What?
我觉得既然你怀孕了012---What? I just figured since you're pregnant,
就不会跟别人约会了012---you're not gonna be seeing people.
乔伊012---Okay, Joey.
首先  他是凯许·福特  不是一般人012---First of all, Kash Ford? Not people.
其次  你告诉他我怀孕了  他说了什么012---Second of all, what did he say when you told him I was pregnant?
我没告诉他  我不确定你要不要告诉别人012---I didn't tell him. I didn't know if you're telling people.
那时候我以为凯许只是"一般人"012---This back when I thought Kash was still "people."
很好  别告诉他012---Good, good. Don't tell him. Don't tell him.
让他打电话给我012---Just have him call me, okay?
瑞秋  我觉得这样不...012---Rach, look. I really don't think that's such a great...
照我的话做  不然我会回到摄影棚012---Okay. You go do it or I'll come back to that set.
泡其他的男演员  一个都不放过012---I'll meet more actors. I'll meet them all.
巴伯  我朋友托比今天还好吗012--- Hey, Bob.  How's my pal Toby doing today?
我看到他时会帮你问一下012---If I see him, I'll ask.
你刚刚在跟六楼的巴伯说话吗012---Was that Bob from six you were just talking to?
对  你们互相认识012--- Yeah.  Then you know each other?
我们知道彼此的名字而已012---We're on a semifirstname basis.
如果他加入我们的团队呢  巴伯吗012--- What do you think of adding him to our team?  Bob?
每天跟我们在这里一起工作012---Working here with us? Every day?
我不知道他有没有那个能耐012---Yeah. I don't know if he has what it takes.
是吗  六楼的人很喜欢他012---Really? They love him down on six.
但这里是11楼012---But this is 11.
这里的工作要难上两倍012---It's almost twice as hard up here.
好吧  我明白你的意思了012---Okay, I hear you loud and clear.
巴伯还是不能调职  我想那样最好012--- Bob will stay put.  I think it's best, sir.
但我们真的急需新鲜血液012---But we really do need to find someone up here.
工作开始越积越多了012---Work is starting to pile up.
我桌上的文件已经叠到这么高了012---I've got a stack of documents on my desk this high.
我给你出个主意  把它们丢到碎纸机里012---You know what we should do. Just toss them in the shredder
就说你从来没有收到它们012---and claim you never got them.
那真的很好笑  宾012---That's a good one, Bing.
我该怎么做他们才会觉得我是认真的012---What does a guy have to do to be taken seriously around here?
我又给了他一次机会  但提姆非走不可012---Okay, I gave him another chance, but Tim has got to go.
但...  不行  他太不称职了012--- But...  No, no, no. He is totally incompetent.
我打电话给推荐他给我的厨师012---I called the chef who recommended him to me.
他说"哈哈  整到你了"012---He said, "Ha, ha! Gotcha!"
但别今天开除他  为什么012--- Okay, okay. But you can't fire him today.  Why not?
因为今天我要甩掉他012---Because I'm dumping him today.
什么  你说他很体贴012---What? You said he was so sweet.
他确实体贴  但也太体贴了012---He is sweet. He's too sweet.
老是打电话给我012---He calls me all the time.
"你平安回家了吗012---"Did you get home from work okay?
你洗澡没出事吧"012---Did you get out of the shower okay?"
别接电话不就得了  那他会亲自过来012--- Just don't pick up your phone.  Then he comes over!
"我好担心你"  有点男子气概吧012---"I was so worried about you." Be a man!
所以现在我不能开除他012---So now I'm not allowed to fire him?
我们不能让他在同一天既失业又失恋012---We can't fire him and dump him on the same day.
他会自杀的012---He'll kill himself.
那我今天开除他012---Okay, well then, I'll fire him today,
你再跟他交往一星期012---and you go out with him another week.
你开什么玩笑  再跟他交往一个星期012---Are you kidding? Another week with that simp,
我会自杀的012---I'll kill myself.
我们都在今天跟他摊牌  让他自己想办法应付012---Okay, then we'll both do it today and he'll just have to deal with it.
好吧  但问题是谁要先说呢012---Okay. But the question is who's gonna go first?
后说的就是贱人012---Whoever goes second is the bitch.
什么意思  开除刚失恋的员工012--- What do you mean?   Come on, fire a guy that's just been dumped?
贱人  甩掉刚失业的恋人012---Bitch! And dump a guy that's just been fired?
金发贱人012---Blond bitch!
我几天前就想开除他  所以应该让我先说012---I wanted to do this days ago, so I think I should go first.
好吧  你说得有理012---All right, that makes sense.
去你的  我要先说012---But screw you! I'm going first!
托比  你有空吗  当然  什么事012--- Toby, you got a sec?  Sure. What's up?
我们刚开完会012---I just had a meeting.
我本想被调职到这里来012---I was actually hoping to get transferred up here,
但刚发现我的美梦破灭了012---but I just found out it's not gonna happen.
很明显有人认为我不是"11楼的材料"012---Apparently somebody thinks I'm not "11 thfloor material."
钱德勒到底是谁012---Say, who the hell is this Chandler?
今晚约会时哪个藉口012---What do you think is a better excuse
最适合我用来挡酒012---for why I'm not drinking on this date tonight?
"我正在戒酒"  "我是摩门教徒"012---"I'm a recovering alcoholic," "I'm a Mormon"...
或是"我昨晚喝太醉现在还在宿醉"012---...or "I got so hammered last night I'm still a little drunk"?
今晚你要做什么012---So, what do you want to do tonight?
安杰丽卡有部很棒的乌克兰电影上映012---There’s a Ukrainian film at the Angelica
听说很震撼人心  你想看吗012---that's supposed to be very powerful. Interested?
没兴趣012---No. No.
但我可以陪你看一般人看的电影012---But I'll go see a normalperson movie with you.
瑞秋  你要一起来吗012---Rach, you wanna come?
不行  我有约会012---Oh, no. I can't. I've got a date.
约会  对  怎么了  很奇怪吗012--- A date?  Yeah. Why, is that weird for you?
不  一点都不奇怪  那很正常012---Why, no. It's the opposite of weird. It's regular.
太普通了  事实上还有点无聊012---It's mundane. It's actually a little dull.
它可不是乌克兰电影012---It's no Ukrainian film.
耳环012---Earrings!
她有约会  对象是谁012---A date? She's got a date? With who?
我撮合她跟一个男演员012---I set her up with this actor on my show.
是你帮她牵的红线  不是012--- You set her up?  No.
乔伊  你在想什么012---Joey, what were you thinking?
我觉得应该没关系012---I was thinking that it would probably be okay...
因为你们两个已经分手五年了012---because Ross hasn’t gone out with Rachel in five years!
乔伊  我担心不是她  而是我的宝宝012---Joey, I'm not worried about her! I'm worried about my baby.
跟她约会的人  也在跟我的宝宝约会012---Whoever she dates, my baby dates.
这个"男演员"要带她去哪里012---Where is this "actor" taking them?
我也是"男演员"012---Hey! I'm an "actor" too.
他们大概要搭渡轮012---I'm not sure. I think they're taking the ferry
到史坦顿岛玩012---out to some Italian place on Staten Island.
渡轮  我的宝宝要搭渡轮012---A ferry? My baby's going on a ferry?
你知道那有多危险吗012---Do you have any idea how dangerous those are?
渡轮是指那种载车的012---Are we talking about one of those big boats
速度缓慢的大船吧012---that carry cars that go like five miles an hour?
他们为什么不去跳飞机  那多有意思012---Why not just jump out of an airplane. Thatthat's a fun date!
或点火柴把彼此烧了  也很有意思012---or burn each other with matches? That's fun, too.
乔伊  凯许  罗斯  他就是凯许012--- Hey, Joey.  Hey, Kash. This is Ross. Ross, this is Kash.
我听说今晚你们要去搭渡轮012---Hey, I hear you're going on a ferry tonight.
你挺大胆啊012---Bit of a daredevil, are we?
这件裙子是不是太露了  嗨   凯许012---Do you guys think this is too slutty? Hi, Kash.
瑞秋  你准备好了吗012---Hey, Rachel. You ready to go?
是的  待会见  好012--- Yeah. See you guys later.  Okay.
祝你们玩的愉快  谢谢012--- Have a great time, you guys.  Thank you.
那件裙子的确太露了012---And yes, it is too slutty!
我很高兴你打电话给我012---I'm so glad you called.
感觉之前一直是我打给你012---I feel like it's always me calling you.
什么事  菲比没事吧012---So, what's up? Is everything okay with Phoebe?
我待会就会没事012---It will be in a minute. Listen.
提姆  你真的很棒012---Tim, you're a really great guy.
那是因为我跟你在一起012---That's because I'm with you.
但我的人生现在走到了...012---It's just, I'm in a place in my life right now where...
抱歉  "刚刚有消息传过来"012---So sorry. "This just in."
是餐厅有急事呼我  莫妮卡要我马上赶过去012---Oh, it's 911 from the restaurant, that means Monica needs me right away.
不是的  我知道发生了什么事012---No, she doesn't! I know what that is.
你可以留下来012---You can stay.
我也会想你的  菲比012---I'll miss you too, Pheebs.
我会把你放在这里012---And I will be holding you right here.
你想看哪部电影012---So, what movie do you wanna see?
我不想看那种得认真看字幕的电影012---And not one I have to read, okay?
我受够看书了012---I get that from books.
书  好吧  汽车杂志  玉米片包装012--- Books?  Alright, car magazines, cereal boxes...
但那就够我受的了012---...but it's enough!
我们别去看电影了012---I tell you what. Why don't we just stay here?
就待在家里玩吧012---Let's not see a movie, we'll just and hang.
你要等瑞秋约会回来吗012---Just wait for Rachel to come back from her date?
如果你想那么做的话  我不会反对012---Hey, if that's what you wanna do, I'm not gonna say no.
哥们  你这是怎么了012---Dude, what is going on?
我得知道他们约会进行得怎样  为什么012--- I have to find out how it went.  Why?
他可能是我孩子的继父012---This guy could be my baby's stepfather.
才约会一次  你就担心他们要结婚了012---They go on one date and you're worried about them getting married?!
他又不是你012---He's not you!
我不敢相信她去约会了012---I just... I can't believe she's dating!
罗斯  你觉得她该怎么做呢012---Ross, what did you think she was gonna do?
我不知道012---I don't know.
我不敢相信会发生这种事012---I guess I just can't believe any of this is happening.
你是什么意思012---What do you mean?
我以为我再生个孩子012---It's just I always thought when I had another kid,
情况会不一样012---it'd be different.
我爱本012---I love Ben.
但每次送他到卡罗尔跟苏珊家012---But every time  I drop him off at Carol and Susan's...
我都会觉得很伤心012---...it breaks my heart a little.
我一直想像着  我跟未来的太太周末躺在床上012---I've always had this picture of me and my next wife in bed on Sunday,
我的孩子跑过来跳到床上012---my kid comes running in, leaps up on the bed
我们会一起看报纸012---and we all read the paper together, you know?
或许还会抢着看科学版012---Maybe fight over the science section.
很棒啊  你现在还是有机会过那样的生活012---That's a nice picture. You can still have that.
不  瑞秋跟别的男人约会去了012---No. No, I can't. Rachel's out with some guy.
我的孩子跟她一起去了012---My baby went with her.
那个梦想只会离我越来越远了012---If anything, that picture keeps moving further away.
我能问你一件事吗012---Hey, can I ask you something?
你想像你未来太太的时候012---In this picture of you and your wife,
她是瑞秋吗012---is your wife Rachel?
以前是的012---It used to be.
现在我梦里的人没有具体的相貌012---Now she doesn't really have a face.
但她的身材超火辣012---Smokin body, though.
说得好  但是罗斯  她已经不是瑞秋了012---Good call. But the face, Ross, the face isn't Rachel.
对  但如果是的话  事情会简单很多吧012---No. But how much easier would it be if it were?
我懂  但那不是她要的生活012---Yeah, I know, but I don't think that's not what she wants.
那也不是我想要的生活012---No, it's not what I want either.
我不能逼自己再爱上她012---I mean II can't force myself to fall in love with her again now.
罗斯  或许你需要新的展望012---Okay, Ross, maybe you need a new picture, okay?
它会跟你之前的梦想不一样012---It won't be what you thought.
但不论如何...012---But no matter what...
你都将迎来一个新的生命  你的孩子012---...there's gonna be a brandnew little baby. Your baby.
谁在乎梦想是什么样的呢012---Who cares what the picture looks like?
对012---Yeah.
我们一起出去找点乐子吧012---I tell you what. Let's you and me go out and have some fun.
你想做什么都行  来吧012---Whatever you want. Come on.

看他跟我有什么过节012---See what his problem is.
好吧  巴伯  听我说012---Okay, Bob. Listen.
是我害你无法调职012---I'm the reason you didn't get the job up here.
托比  不要  巴伯012--- Toby, don't.  Bob.
托比  别替他背黑锅了012---Toby, I'm not gonna let you cover for him.
你说任何话只会让我更气钱德勒012---Anything you say will just get me more upset with Chandler.
那还真是让我进退两难012---That puts me in a difficult position.
我收到你的寻呼了  没事吧012---I got your page. Is everything okay?
那得视情况而定012---That depends.
你跟菲比还好吧012---How are you and Phoebe?

你被开除了  为什么012--- You're fired.  Why?
抱歉  我还没有准备好跟别人长期交住012---I'm sorry. I'm not ready for a relationship right now.
我也很抱歉  但我喜欢凡事照我的方法来做012---I'm sorry too. But I like things done a certain way.
我们之间的化学反应不对012---The chemistry's just not right.
这个理由很好  我们也是一样012---Oh that's good, the chemistry thing for us too.
好吧012---Wow. Okay.
我知道我大黏人了012---I realize I came on a little strong,
那是因为我觉得你很棒012---but it's because I think you're so amazing.
我要告诉你012---I just wanna tell you how much
我很感激你给我这个机会012---I appreciate you giving me an opportunity here.

总之...012---Anyway...
提姆  等一下  什么事012--- Tim, wait.  Yeah?
我话说得太快了  这份工作需要时间学习012---I think I spoke too quickly. There's a learning curve with this job.
或许我们可以再试一次012---And maybe we could try it again.
真的吗  是的012--- Really?  Yeah.
谢谢  我知道我可以表现得更好  好012--- Thank you so much. I know I can be better.  Okay.

你好  嗨012--- Hello.  Hi.
你约会情况如何012---How was the date?
我现在孤身一人  还买了15块钱的糖果012---I'm alone and I just bought $ 15 wonth of candy bars.
你觉得呢012---What do you think?
发生了什么事012---What happened?
我不知深浅地告诉他我怀孕了012---I made the mistake of telling him I was pregnant.
他不能接受吗  他的反应比你强012--- He didn't take it so well?  Well, better than you.
但那还不是我想要的反应012---But still not what you want.
对  他变得举止怪异  语无伦次012---Yeah. He got all weird and sputtery.
然后他说"我听说长痔疮很烦人的"012---Then he said: "I hear those hemorrhoids are a bitch."
他听着很镇静  是吧012--- He sounds swell.  Doesn't he?
我给你讲点好笑的事情吧  好啊012--- You want a little cheering up?  Yeah.
坐下  好012--- Sit down.  Okay.

钱德勒·M·宾  天啊012---Chandler M. Bing. Oh, my God.
我很遗憾你的约会没有成功  没事的012--- I'm sorry about your date.  It's all right.
我猜我受够了约会012---I guess I'm just done with the whole dating thing.
那只是我生命中另一个翻天覆地的变化012---Just one more thing in my life that's suddenly completely different.
这真的很难  我了解012--- This is hard.  Yeah, I know.
但反过来说012---On the other hand,
再过七个月你就要拥有一个宝宝了012---in about seven months you're gonna have something...
你对他的爱012---...that you're gonna love
胜于你对任何约会对象的感觉012---more than any guy you've ever gone out with.
等着吧012---Just wait.
等到孩子第一次抓住你的手指012---Wait until the first time your baby grabs your finger.
那种感觉妙极了012---You have no idea.
谢谢你  亲爱的012---Thanks, sweetie.
你要喝杯咖啡吗012---You wanna grab some coffee?
不  我要回家吃掉10根棒棒糖012---No. I'm gonna go eat 10 candy bars.
