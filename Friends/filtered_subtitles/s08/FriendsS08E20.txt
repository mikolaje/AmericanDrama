有多少人会来参加宝宝的欢迎会012---So, what's the final head count on my baby shower?
大约有20个人  有些同事有事没空过来012---About twenty. Couple people from work had something else to do.
你的妹妹们打电话来说她们没办法来012---Also both of your sisters called and neither can make it.
什么  她们竟然不来参加012---What? You mean they're not coming to a social event
没有男人跟酒精的社交聚会012---where there's no men and no booze?
那真的是太稀奇了012---That's shocking.
我不在乎  只要我妈能来就行了012---I don't care, as long as my mom's here.
天啊  你妈012---Oh, my God. Your mother.
怎么  我妈不会来吗012---What? My mom's not gonna be here?
由于我们忘了邀请她012---Well, given that we forgot to invite her,
她要是能来那还真是天大的巧合呢012---it would be a big coincidence if she was.
我的天啊012---My God!
不是我的错  负责邀请来宾的是菲比012---It wasn't my fault, Phoebe was in charge of the invitations.
我没有妈妈  所以我常忘了012---I don't have a mother. So often I forget...
少来了你012---Oh, give it a rest.
所以说我妈不来参加宝宝的欢迎会吗012---So my mother is not coming to my baby shower?
对012---No.
我妈也不会来012---Neither is mine.
你别着急012---You know what? Don't worry.
我们会处理的  我们会打电话给她012---We'll take care of it. We'll call her.
你先回家做准备012---You go home and get ready.
确定她一定会来  这对我很重要  她是我妈012---Please, make sure she comes. It's really important to me. It's my mom.
我知道  她电话号码是多少  我不知道012--- I know. What's her number?  I don't know.
你去吧  我记在我的电话簿里了012---Go. I have it in my book. Go.
等等  如果你负责邀请来宾012---Wait a minute. If you're in charge of invitations,
那为什么是我打电话给她012---why am I the one who has to call her?

我的女儿们已经告诉我了012---I know, my daughter's told me about it
她们一个月前就接到欢迎会的"临时"请帖了012---when they received their impromptu invitations a month ago.
好吧  我很抱歉012---Okay, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
为什么呢  亲爱的012---For what, dear?
为了没有邀请我  还是说谎骗我呢012---For not inviting me, or for lying about it?
天啊  我的屁股在流汗012---Oh, my God! My ass is sweating.
拜托了  您能来吗  四点开始012---Please, please, can you come? It starts at 4:00.

我不建议让管家兼职012---Now I don't want you to use your housekeeper
因为那样她会分心的012---'cause it would just split her focus.
事实上  我不打算请奶妈012---Actually, I'm not gonna use a nanny.

参赛者不该相互交谈的012---I don't think the contestants aren't supposed to speak to each other.

她要搬过来跟我和罗斯住012---She wants to move in with me and Ross
以便帮忙照顾宝宝012---to help take care of the baby.
多久  八星期012--- For how long?  Eight weeks.
我爱我妈012---I love my mother,
但是跟她一起吃长午餐就是种折磨012---but, my God, a long lunch with her is taxing.
如果她想跟我住  我会觉得很荣幸012---I personally would be honored if she wanted to live with me.
她又听不到你拍马屁012---She can't hear you.
我该怎么样012---What am I gonna do?
如果不希望她搬过去  你该直说012---If you don't want your mother to move in with you, just tell her.
你说得对  我就快生了012---You're right. You're right. I'm about to have a baby.
我可以说我不希望她012---I can tell my mother that I don't want her
睡在我家沙发上012---to just be sleeping on my couch!
她会睡在我床上 绝不能让那种事发生012---She'll wanna sleep in my bed with me. This can't happen.
没错012---That's right. That is right.
你去告诉她012---You go over there and tell her
你不希望她搬过去跟你们住012---you don't want her to live with you.
一定要坚持立场  好012--- Do not take no for an answer.  Okay.
这简直太棒了  现在她会生瑞秋的气012---This is great! Now she's gonna be mad at Rachel!
我要趁虚而入012---And I'm just gonna swoop in there
当她的乖女儿讨好她012---and be like the daughter she never had.
我对钱德勒又产生了新的敬意012---I have new respect for Chandler.
好了  大伙们  该来拆礼物了012---All right, everybody! It's time to open the presents!
对  瑞秋要拆的第一样礼物...012---Yes! I think the first gift that Rachel opens...
应该是外婆送的礼物012---...should be from the grandmother of the baby.
因为你是这里最重要的人012---Because you're the most important person in this room!
也是全世界最重要的人012---And in the world!
我没有准备礼物012---I don't have a gift
因为我直到最后时刻才受到邀请012---because I wasn't invited until the last minute.

宝贝  我知道你会是个好妈妈012---Sweet heart, I know you're gonna be a terrific mom.
但我觉得一开始你还是需要有人帮忙012---I just think you need a little help, especially at the beginning.
我知道自己在做什么  我应付得来012---But mom, I really know what I'm doing. I can handle this.
真的吗  还记得亮亮吗012---Really? Remember Twinkles?
他是只仓鼠  我又不会拿吸尘器吸我的宝宝012---He was a hamster. I'm not gonna vacuum up my baby!

是尿布精灵  是用来放干净尿布的012--- It's a Diaper Genie.  It dispenses clean diapers!
那是放脏尿布的012---No. It's where you put dirty ones.
真恶心  为什么不直接把脏尿布012---That's gross. Why don't you take it outside
丢在外面的垃圾桶里012---and throw it in a dumpster?
你每天要丢十次吗012---You're gonna do that 10 times a day?
什么  宝宝一天可以拉十次012---What, it goes 10 times a day?
难道我们给她喂的是印度食物吗012---Are we feeding this baby Indian food?
不  宝宝都是那样的012---No, dear. That's what babies do.

再说  你去倒垃圾的时候012---Plus, what are you planning on doing with the baby
你的宝宝该怎么办012---while you're trotting out to the garbage ten times a day?
我不知道  把她放在尿布桌上012---I don't know, I'd leave it on the changing table?
怎么  我做错了什么012---What? What did I do? What did I do?
你不能丢下宝宝一个人012---You can't leave a baby alone.
我当然知道012---Of course, I know that!
千万不能丢下宝宝一个人012---Of course you never leave a baby alone.

她跟我这个菜鸟妈妈在一起也会不安全012---Not as safe as she would be with me, the baby dummy.
这样吧012---You know what?
现在拆礼物让我有点不知所措012---Opening the presents is a little overwhelming right now.
我待会再把礼物都拆开012---So I think I'm gonna maybe open them all a little bit later.
谢谢你们赶来  还送了礼物...012---But thank you for coming, and for these beautiful gifts...
这个篮子很漂亮012---...and this basket is beautiful.

我们把那些东西都删掉了 没有轮子或机会卡012---We've eliminated all that. No wheel. No cards.
为什么012---Why?

我会帮忙喂她吃饭012---I will be there to feed her...
帮她洗澡  换尿布012---...and bathe her and change her.
更重要的是  我愿意照顾她012---And more than that, I want to do all those things.

你真的太幽默了012---You're just so funny. You're so funny.
我到底该怎么办012---What do I do?
没什么  你跟她道过很多次歉了012---Nothing. You have apologized to her, like, a million times.
结果她对你的态度还是一样恶劣012---And she's been nothing but terrible to you.
别忘了  你刚刚帮她女儿012---And don't forget, you just threw her daughter
办了个稍显无聊的温馨欢迎会012---a lovely, albeit slightly boring, shower.
她甚至都没有谢谢你012---And she hasn't even thanked you for it.

得体的做法是接受道歉012---the decent thing to do is to accept it.
我对你的所作所为并非故意012---Because what I did to you, it wasn't on purpose!
但你对我的态度太恶毒了012---But what you're doing to me now is plain spiteful.
恶毒  没错012--- Spiteful?  That's right.
