好了  这是全新的一天012---All right, it's a new day.
关于瑞秋的那件事呢012---All that stuff about Rachel?
现在你没那种感觉了  那简直太疯狂了012---You don't feel that now. It was crazy.
你没事  你好的不得了012---You're fine. You're better than fine.
你就像朋友汤尼说的那样  "棒极了"012---You are, as your friend Tony would say, "Great!"
一切都很正常012---Everything's normal.
她只是你的朋友  瑞秋012---She's just your friend, Rachel.
你的朋友瑞秋012---Your friend, Rachel.
你的朋友瑞秋012---Your friend. Rachel.
嗨  亲爱的012---Hi, sweetie.
嗨  她是你女朋友瑞秋012---Hey, it's your girlfriend, Rachel!
《老友记》  第八季  第13集  钱德的泡泡浴012---Friends S08E13 The One Where Chandler Takes a Bath
你...你磕嗨了吗012---Are you...? Are you high?
我刚刚泡了一个超舒服的澡012---I just had the most amazing bath.
真的吗  我不喜欢泡澡012---Really? I don't like baths.
你喜欢跟我泡鸳鸯浴啊012---Wait. You like them with me.
亲爱的  我喜欢的不是泡澡012---Honey, it's not the bath I enjoy.
我是喜欢看全身湿答答的裸体女人012---It's the wet, naked lady.
泡澡能让你全身放松012---Baths are so relaxing.
真的吗  你在里面做什么012---Really? What do you do?
不过是坐在浴缸里  泡着自己洗过的脏水012---You just sit in there, stewing in your own filth.
你觉得我能有多脏呢012---How dirty do you think I am?
如果你点上蜡烛012---I'm telling you if you had some candles
配上泡泡跟音乐  你一定会爱上泡澡012---and some bubbles and some music, you would love it.
能帮你解除压力  一身轻松012---It would take all of your stress away.
现在是星期三下午两点  我正在看越野单车赛012---Honey, it's 2:00 on a Wednesday and I'm watching Road Rules.
你觉得我的压力会有多大012---How stressed do you think I am?
钱德勒012---Hey, Chandler.
你有空吗  我真的需要跟你谈一谈012---You got a minute? I really need to talk to you.
好  这场谈话是要配冷披萨012---Oh, yeah. Is this a coldpizza talk
还是配剩肉卷012---or a leftovermeat loaf talk?
都不是012---Well, neither.
天啊  发生了什么大事012---Oh, my God, what's up?
我不知道  只是...012---I don't know. It's just...
最近我觉得...012---Lately, I've been feeling...
好吧  事情是这样的012---Okay, here's what it is.
你知道吗  我觉得好多了  谢谢012---You know what? I feel a lot better. Thanks.
快回来告诉我012---Just come back.
好吧012---Okay.
你跟莫妮卡当了很久的朋友012---You and Monica, friends for a long time.
当然这是有规则的012---And sure, there are rules.
之后你们去了伦敦012---But then you went to London.
可是那不一样012---But that's different.
这也是有规则的  你理解我的意思吗012---There are rules there too, you know what I mean?
你自己理解吗012---Do you?
你们的情况和我不一样012---It was different for you guys.
你们刚好在同一个地方  对吧012---I mean, you were both in the same place, right? 
在伦敦  对012--- In London?  Yeah.
对  莫妮卡跟我在伦敦时我们刚好都在那里012---Yes, when Monica and I were in London, we were both in London.
我就不该来找你012---You know what. This is a bad idea.
算了  就当我什么都没说012---Forget it. Forget all about it.
帮我个忙  别把这件事说出去012---And listen, do me a favor, this conversation between you and me.
我会尽力的012---If that.
罗斯  别忘了明天我们要一起去产检012---Oh, Ross, don't forget we have that doctor's appointment tomorrow.
好  你们要知道宝宝的性别了吗012--- Right.  Hey, are you going to find out the sex of the baby?
不  我们不想知道012---No. We talked about it. We don't wanna know.
我们只在乎宝宝是不是健康快乐012---All we care about is that it's happy and healthy.
对  健康快乐  还有可爱012---Yep, happy and healthy. And cute.
聪明  万人迷012--- And smart.  Popular.
还要有科学精神012---With an aptitude for science.
你们两个说的是同一个宝宝吗012---Are you two talking about the same baby?
你们开始想名字了吗012---Hey, have you thought of names yet?
对  我想到一大堆012---Oh, yeah. I've come up with a bunch of ideas.
真的吗  我也是  我也是012--- Really? Me too.  Me too.
真的吗012---Really?
如果是女孩就叫菲比  如果是男孩就叫菲宝012---If it's a girl, Phoebe. And if it's a boy, Pheebo.
或许吧012---Maybe.
但多想些备用名字应该有益无害012---But it wouldn't hurt to have a backup, you know?
瑞秋  你都想到什么名字  好吧012--- Rach, what were you thinking?  Okay.
我想如果是女孩012---I was thinking if it's a girl...
叫她珊德妮好吗  这是法文012---...how about Sandrene? It's French.
很适合做工业溶剂公司的名字012---That's a really pretty name for an industrial solvent.
好吧  你想到什么012---Okay, fine. What do you have?
我想到一个男孩的名字012---It's for a boy.
我知道起这个名字有点疯狂012---I know it's a little out there, but...
达尔文012---...Darwin.
天啊  我们的孩子会在操场上被打死012---Oh, my God. Our child will be beaten to death in the schoolyard.
对  被珊德妮打死012---Yeah, by Sandrene.
你那么说是因为我不喜欢你想的名字012---You're just saying that because I said no to your name.
我是本来就不喜欢012---I'm really, really not.
你们各有五次否决权  如何012---How about you each get five vetoes?
听起来很公平012---That sounds fair.
不过我觉得你根本用不着否决  听着012---I don't think you'll need it though. Check this out.
如果是女孩就叫小雨012---If it's a girl, Rain.
否决012---Veto.
为什么012---Why?
小雨  "嗨  我叫小雨012---Rain? "Hi, my name is Rain.
我有自己的炉子  我的衣服是用麦子做的"012---I have my own kiln, and my dress is made out of wheat."
我认识她012---I know her!
我在死人秀里跟她买了一块手工肥皂012---I bought a homemade soap from her at a Dead show!
好  如果是男孩就叫撒切尔012---Okay. How about for a guy, Thatcher?
罗斯  你为什么那么恨我们的孩子012---Ross, why do you hate our child?
好吧  轮到你了  詹姆斯012--- Fine, you go.  Okay. James.
如果是女孩的话  否决012--- But only if it's a girl.  Veto.
我喜欢萝丝  你觉得呢012---How about... I like Ruth. What about Ruth?
抱歉  难道我们的宝宝89岁了吗012---Oh, I'm sorry. Are we having an 89yearold?
戴顿呢  否决  斯图亚特012--- How about Dayton?  Veto. Stewart.
否决  索耶012---Veto. Sawyer.
否决  海伦  否决012--- Veto. Helen.  Veto.
你们没觉得"否决"这个名字很好听吗012---Is it me, or is Veto starting to sound really good?
天啊  我为你准备了一个大惊喜012---Boy, do I have a surprise for you.
在阳台上做爱吗012---Sex on the balcony?
不  但某人一直放不下这个念头是吧012---No. But someone's really not gonna get over that idea, are they?
怎么了  我帮你放了洗澡水012--- What is it?  I drew you a bath.
我不喜欢泡澡012---I don't like baths.
你愿意跟我去阳台上做爱吗012---Could you draw me a picture of us having sex on the balcony?
拜托你试试看  我使出了全部绝招012---Please. Will you just try it for me. I used all my best stuff.
我点了蜡烛  放了音乐012---I lit some candles, I put on some music.
用了浴盐跟泡泡浴012---I used bath salts, plus bubble bath.
我还帮你找了个海军模型船012---And got you this little plastic Navy ship!
体现你的男性雄风012---So it's a boy bath.
确实稍微增添了点男人味012---This does butch it up a bit.
我发誓你试过后一定会爱上泡澡的012---I swear, if you try it, you will love it.
如果我答应泡澡012---If I do this,
我们能不能至少讨论在阳台上做爱的事012---can we at least discuss sex on the balcony?
当然可以012---Absolutely.
但我知道那场讨论会如何进行012---But I know how that discussiors gonna go.
好吧  还不赖012---All right, this isn't so bad.
我喜欢花香味012---I like the flowery smell.
这没什么不妥  因为我手上有船012---Which is okay, because I've got my boat.
怎么样  我的天啊012--- So?  Oh, my God.
我就说过你会喜欢泡澡嘛012---I told you you were a bath person.
等你洗完  我可以帮你做脸012---Hey, when you get out, maybe I can give you a facial.
我需要一艘更雄伟的船012---I'm gonna need a bigger boat.
我觉得你对萝丝这个名字不够开通012---I don't think you had an open mind about the name Ruth.
拜托嘛  小萝丝·盖勒  多可爱啊012---I mean, come on, little Ruthie Geller? How cute is that?
天啊  我仿佛听到了搓麻将的声音012---Oh, my God, I can practically hear the mahjong tiles.
好了  检查结果都很正常012---Okay. All your tests look fine.
你们想知道宝宝的性别吗012---Are you two interested in knowing the sex of the baby?
我们不想知道012---No, we're not.
但病历里面有记录012---But you have it right there in that file?
你可以告诉我们是男孩或是女孩012---You could tell us whether it's a boy or a girl?
戴顿或珊德妮  菲比或菲宝012---Dayton or Sandrene? Phoebe or Pheebo?
没错  如果你们不想知道012---That's right. But if you don't wanna know...
不  我们愿意等  对吧  对012--- No, we wanna wait. Right?  Right. Right.
我马上回来012---Oh, I'll be right back.
我知道自己不该多嘴012---I know it's really not my place...
但请不要给宝宝取名叫菲宝012---...but please don't name your child Pheebo.
你觉得哪个宝宝最丑012---So which of these babies do you think is the ugliest?
什么  瑞秋  你这么说太恶毒了012---What? Rach, come on, that's terrible.
他们是宝宝  都很可爱012---They're babies. They're all beautiful.
左起第三个012---Third one from the left?
对  他为什么要盯着我看012---Yeah. Why is it staring at me?
他大概知道我在说他坏话012---I think it knows I'm talking about it.
你不...  怎么了012--- Don't you...?  What?
你在偷看012---You're looking!
我没有  我看到了012--- I didn't!  I saw you!
好吧  我在偷看  但我什么都没有看到012---Fine, I did, but I didn't see anything. I swear.
你太可耻了  丑宝宝唾弃你012---Shame on you! Ugly baby judges you!
好吧  听我说  我没有...012---Okay. But Ross, listen to me, I didn't...
别告诉我  我不想知道012---No, no. Don't tell me! I don't wanna know!
我想说也没办法  因为我也不知道012---I couldn't even if I wanted to, because I don't know!
我发誓我什么都没看到012---I swear I didn't see anything!
我不想知道  刚刚我是一时糊涂012---I don't want to know. It was just a momentary lapse.
一时糊涂012---Momentary lapse?
你不懂得自制吗012---Don't you have any selfcontrol?
好吧  你要是能早几个月做这场说教就好了012---Okay. A couple months late on the lecture, Ross.
我回来了012---Hello?
我在浴室  你能进来一下吗012---I'm in the bathroom. Can you come in here?
我觉得不太对劲012---I think there's something wrong.
我还是在这里等着吧012---You know what? I think I'll wait out here.
我在浴缸里012---I'm in the bathtub.
怎么了012---What's wrong?
我自己放了洗澡水  但方法不对012---I drew my own bath, but I did it wrong.
水不冷不热  浴盐没有溶解012---The water's tepid, the salt didn't dissolve
现在都结块了012---and is now lodged places.
我用的几种香料闻起来很不协调012---And the scents I used don't compliment each other.
桉树加甘菊012---Eucalyptus and chamomile?
怎么了  浴盐012--- What?  Bath salts.
开始冒泡了012---They're starting to effervesce.
感觉完全不同012---It's different.
这感觉真有意思012---It's interesting.
好吧  我们谈谈别的事吧012---Okay. Let's talk about something else.
好  今天你过得还好吧012---Yeah. Sure. So, what was going on with you today?
乔伊今天跟我聊了一些很奇怪的事情012---I actually had the weirdest conversation with Joey.
他谈到规则  还有对错012---He was talking about rules and right and wrong.
我也跟他谈过这些012---I had the exact same conversation.
是吗  他到底在说什么012---You did? What was he talking about?
自从他演过《麦克白》之后012---I don't know. Joey hasn't had this much trouble
我还没见过他说不出话的样子012---getting out words since we saw him in Macbeth.
那可真是漫长的一夜012---That was a long night.
好吧  我们来分析一下012---All right, let's break this down.
他到底跟你说了什么012---What exactly did he say to you?
他说到规则012---Okay. He was talking about rules
对别人有了不同的感觉012---and looking at people differently.
他没有跟我说那个问题012---He didn't say anything about that to me.
他跟你说了什么012---What'd he tell you?
他问到你跟我在伦敦发生的事012---He was asking all this questions about you, me and London.
从头至尾都在谈规则012---And of course the glue that holds this all together, the rules.
好吧  你跟我在伦敦012---Okay. So you, me and London.
对别人有不同的感觉012---Looking at people differently.
或许他想跟某人发生你跟我在伦敦所做的事012---Maybe he wants to do what you and I did in London with someone.
但他说"规则"是什么意思012---But what'd he mean by "rules"?
等一下  菲比走进来时  他就不说了012---Wait a minute. He stopped talking the minute Phoebe came in.
因为他对她的感觉不同了012---Because he was looking at her differently.
菲比是他的朋友012---And Phoebe is his friend.
他觉得那样违反了规则012---So he thinks that would be breaking the rules.
天啊  他想跟菲比在伦敦上床012---My God, he wants to do it with Phoebe in London!
你们在哪里  等一下012--- You guys?  Just a minute!
崔比安尼太太来了012---That's Mrs. Tribbiani.
什么都别说012---You don't say anything.
我为什么要说012---Why would I say anything?
我们的两个好朋友012---That two of our friends could start
就要展开一段伟大恋情012---the greatest love affair of their lives?
他们将来可要谢我012---They would have me to thank.
然后我们可以一起开始怀孕生孩子012---Then we could all start having babies!
我不准你告诉她012---I'm not gonna let you say anything.
你就待在这里012---You just stay here.
天啊012---Oh, God!
莫妮卡  我拿熨斗来还你012---Hey, Monica, I brought back your iron.
是你拿走的吗  我还以为我弄丢了012---Oh, you had that? I thought I lost it.
一个月前  我买了个新的012---I got a new one a month ago.
太好了  我把这个弄坏了012---Oh, just as well. I broke this one.
怎么  没事012--- What?  Nothing.
好吧012---Okay.
我实在不该说  我不该说出来的012---I really shouldn't say. I'm really not supposed to.
好吧012---Fine.
这可是个好消息012---It's a humdinger.
可惜你不能告诉我012---Well, then it's really too bad that you can't tell me.
有人喜欢你012---Somebody likes you!
是钱德勒吗012---Is it Chandler?
不是  那叫他别再盯着我看了012--- No!  Then tell him to stop staring.
是乔伊012---It's Joey.
真的吗  乔伊  看不出来啊012---Really? Joey? You don't say.
你对他有意思吗012---Is it something you'd be interested in?
我不知道  我不知道012---I don't know, I don't know. I don't know.
我一方面会想"天啊  我可以跟他在一起吗"012---You know, I mean, on the one hand, "Mother, may I?"
但另一方面012---But, you know, on the other hand...
不行  我们是朋友012---No. No, I can't. We're friends.
不行  我不能拿我们现在的友谊冒险012---Oh, no. I don't wanna risk what we have.
你说得有道理012---I guess that makes sense.
你要跟他谈一谈吗012---You think you're gonna talk to him?
当然  他可是乔伊012---Sure. I mean, it's Joey.
我不希望他受伤害012---I don't want him to get hurt.
我简直是势不可挡啊012---Well, I must say, I am on fire!
先是钱德勒  现在又是乔伊012---First Chandler, now Joey.
没有钱德勒  只有乔伊  好吧012--- Not Chandler. Just Joey.  Sure.
你知道吗  我想过了012---You know what? I've been thinking about it.
我开始接受萝丝这个名字了012---I'm really coming around on the name Ruth.
我觉得可以考虑帮孩子取那个名字012---I think I would actually consider naming our child that.
瑞秋  这对我来说简直意义重大012---Rach, I can't tell you how much that means to me.
等一下012---Wait a minute.
等一下  你之前很讨厌萝丝这个名字012---Wait a minute. You hated the name Ruth.
你为什么会改变心意012---Why would you change your mind?
除非你知道我们根本用不上它012---Unless you know we're never gonna have to use it.
你看到病历了  知道自己怀的是男孩012---You did see the folder. You know it's a boy!
我什么都没有看到012---I didn't see anything.
我真的是改变了心意012---I actually changed my mind about the name.
我可不觉得  你答应让我选萝丝012---I don't think so. You're giving me Ruth...
如果你生了儿子 你就能帮他取名字了012---...so you get to name him when it's a boy.
到时候你会决定叫他海瑟012---That's when you'll swoop in and name him Heath
布兰恩或史奎亚012---or Blaine or Sequoia.
我会...史奎亚012---I would... Sequoia!
否决  好吧012--- Veto.  Fine.
除非...012---Unless...
你知道我会看穿你的阴谋012---...you anticipated that I would figure all this out...
而你知道自己怀的是女孩012---...and you know that it actually is a girl.
你真的希望她叫萝丝012---And you really do want her to be named Ruth.
我才不会上当  好吧012---Well, I'm not falling for that! Okay?
不要考虑萝丝了012---Ruth is off the table!
可是你想给孩子取这个名字啊012---But, Ross, you want the name Ruth.
我不会让你得逞012---Not like this!
怎么了012---What's up?
乔伊  我知道了  什么012--- Joey, I know.  What?
我知道了  什么012--- I know.  What?
我知道你的心思了012---I know about your feelings.
天啊  真的吗012---Oh, my God, did you?
对不起  虽然钱德勒跟莫妮卡终成眷属了012---Yes. I'm sorry. I know things worked out for Chandler and Monica,
但那是少之又少的例子012---but that's rare.
我知道  比起他们的情况012---I know. And this is so much more complicated
我的情况复杂多了012---than it was for those guys.
她可是瑞秋啊012---I mean, it's Rachel, for God's sakes.
天啊  是瑞秋012---For God's sakes, it's Rachel!
就是嘛  她不只是我的朋友012---I know! She's not only my friend,
她还怀孕了012---she's my pregnant friend.
她不仅怀孕了  还是罗斯的前女友012---She's my pregnant friend who's Ross' ex!
对  那是瑞秋012---Yeah, that's Rachel.
我哪能比得上她012---Beat me over the head with it.
我该怎么办012---What am I gonna do?
我努力克服对她的这种感觉012---I keep trying to get rid of these feelings.
昨晚我整夜没睡012---I stayed up all last night
写出所有我不喜欢她的地方012---and made a list of everything I don't like about her.
你想听听看吗  好012--- You wanna hear it?  Yeah.
"她要我改吃低卡美乃滋"012---"She made me switch to light mayo."
没了  我只想到这点012---That's it! That's all I got!
其实低卡的味道一样  而且我的裤腰变松了012---You know what? Tastes the same and my pants fit better.
乔伊  我觉得你是庸人自扰012---Joey, I think you're getting upset for nothing.
或许你对她只是一时好感012---This is probably just a crush.
你真的那么觉得吗012---You think?
没错  你对她顿生好感012---Absolutely. You get this rush of feelings,
但那种感觉会消失012---but then it goes away.
对  我对她只是一时好感012---Yeah, just a crush. That's all this is.
一时好感012---It's a crush!
我是乔伊  我才不会玩真的012---I'm Joey. I don't get deep feelings.
就是嘛  这种情况经常发生012---Right. There you go. Crushes happen all the time.
我对你们三个男生也有过那种感觉012---I know I've had them for all you guys.
除了罗斯跟钱德勒012---Except for Ross and Chandler.
我相信你对我们三个也是  不尽然012--- And I'm sure you've had them for us.  Not really.
你就不能可怜可怜我012---Throw me a bone here.
我打电话给医生了012---So I called the doctor.
现在我们都知道宝宝的性别了012---Now we both know the sex of the baby.
什么012---What?
没错  我青出于蓝胜于蓝012---That's right. The student has become the master.
罗斯  我发誓我真的不知道012---Ross, I swear. I don't know.
少来了  你知道是个女孩012---Oh, come on, you know it's a girl.
什么012---A what?
你真的不知道012---You really didn't know?
我们要有女儿了  不012--- We're having a girl?  No.
你就是那么说的  不012--- That's what you said.  No.
你说是女孩  是  我真的很抱歉012--- You said girl.  Yes. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
没关系  我们要有女儿了012---I'm not! We're having a girl!
有时候我不敢相信孩子他爸是你012---Sometimes I can't believe it's with you,
但我们要有女儿了012---but still, we're having a girl!
