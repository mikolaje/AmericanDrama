天啊  你打扫过了012---Oh, my God, you cleaned!
瞧这地板  你还擦了窗户012---Look at these floors! You did the windows!
我跟你提了好几个月  你真的打扫了012---I have been begging you for months! And you did, you cleaned.
看来唠叨还是有用的012---And nagging works!
不  事实上这不是我干的012---No, I didn't actually do this.
不是吧  我又梦游打扫了吗012---Oh, no. Was I cleaning in my sleep again?
不  也不是你012---No, it wasn't you.
那么是谁  我请了一个女佣  耶012--- Well, then, who?  I got a maid. Yay!
我希望你所说的"女佣"是指"情妇"012---I hope by "maid" you mean "mistress"
因为如果有其他女人在打扫咱家房子的话012---because if some other woman was cleaning...
亲爱的  我知道你不喜欢让出控制权012---Now, honey, I know you don't like to relinquish control.
"让出"就是"失去"的委婉说法吧012---"Relinquish" is just a fancy word for "lose."
她人真的很棒012---She's really nice, okay?
她还说她喜欢你摆放海绵的方式012---And she mentioned that she adored the way you arranged the sponges.
她真的那么说了吗012---Did she really say that?
对  我记得很清楚  因为我以为她在开玩笑012---Yes, I distinctly remember because I thought it was a joke.
给她一个机会  好吗012---Now, just give her a chance, okay?
好吧  我办得到012---Fine, I can do it.
怎么了012---What's the matter?
通常我一焦虑就会打扫012---Usually when I'm this anxious, I clean.
《老友记》  第八季  第7集  墨水印012---Friends S08E07 The One With The Stain
是谁的手机在响  吵死了012---Whose cell phone is that? It's just so annoying.
走到哪里都会发生这种事012---Everywhere you go.
我想声音是从你的包包里传出来的012---I think it's coming from your bag.
从来没有人会打电话给我012---I never get calls!
喂012---Hello?
嗨  我是万圣节派对上的艾力克012---Hi, it's Eric, from the Halloween party.
厄休拉的未婚夫012---Ursula's fiance.
天啊  艾力克  嗨012---Oh, my God, Eric, hi!
等一下  你怎么知道我的电话号码012---Wait, how'd you get this number?
我有个警察朋友  他帮我查到的012---I have a friend who's a cop, and he got it for me.
这严重侵犯了我的权利  但却让人又惊又喜012---Wow. What an incredible violation and wonderful surprise!
我想告诉你012---Listen, I just... I thought you should know
我跟厄休拉分手了012---I broke up with Ursula.
是吗  他办到了012---Oh, you did? He did it, he did it!
他做了什么  我在讲电话012--- What did he do?  I'm talking!
总之我很好奇012---Anyway, I was wondering
你平时吃不吃午餐012---if you were the sort of person who eats lunch?
你是在约我吗012---Are you asking me out?
因为那样会很奇怪012---Because it'd be kind of weird
你刚刚才跟我姐姐分手012---since you just broke up with my sister.
好吧  抱歉012---Yeah, okay. I'm sorry.
再见  不  等一下012--- Bye.  No, no. Wait!
我那么说是希望你觉得我是个好人012---I was just saying that so you'd think I was a good person.
努力争取我吧012---Fight for me.
我不会轻易接受你的拒绝012---I won't take "no" for an answer.
虽然表现不太好  但我们可以边吃午餐边练习012---Not great, but we can work on it at lunch.
我可以在两小时内赶到你家012---I can be at your apartment in two hours.
太棒了  你怎么知道我住在哪里012---Great. How do you know where I live?
我也有朋友012---I've got friends too.
好吧  再见  再见012--- Okay, bye.  Bye.
天啊  我要跟艾力克约会了012---Oh, my God, I'm going out with Eric!
今天比我想像中012---This day is really gonna be so much better
还要美好012---than I thought it was gonna be.
罗斯  我没办法跟你吃午餐了012---Oh, Ross, I can't make lunch.
很明显我午餐时间有空012---So apparently I'm available for lunch.
不行  我很忙  我在找房子012---I can't. I'm busy. I'm apartment hunting.
你要搬家012---You're moving?
孩子生下来后我不可能跟乔伊一起住012---I can't live with Joey once the baby comes.
我不希望我的孩子会说的第一句话是012---I don't want my child's first words to be,
"你好吗"012---"How you doing?"
乔伊知道你要搬家吗012---So does Joey know you're moving?
我还没有跟他谈  但我知道他会觉得如释重负012---I haven't discussed it with him, but I know he'll be relieved.
上星期他带了一个女孩回家012---Last week, he brought this girl over,
我跟她谈晨吐的问题012---and I talked to her about morning sickness.
还把我怀孕纪念册的照片拿给她看012---Then I showed her pictures from my pregnancy book.
内容不会很色情吧  不太会012--- That's not really porn?  Not so much.
既然你在找房子012---You know what? If you're looking for a place,
今早我在电梯里听说012---I just heard in the elevator this morning
我住的公寓里有个女住户过世了012---that a woman in my building died.
天啊  她年纪很老了吗012---Oh, my God. Was she old?
她的公寓景观好吗012---Does she have a view?
我不知道  但那样一定会很棒012---I don't know, but how great would that be?
你搬到我的公寓里来012---You living in my building?
我可以照顾宝宝  想过去就过去...012---I could take care of the baby, I could come over whenever I want...
当然得先得到你的允许012---...with your permission.
那就太好了  我们能去看看吗012---That really would be great. Well, can we see it?
或许我们不该那么做012---Maybe we shouldn't.
毕竟她今天早上才过世012---I mean, if she just died this morning out of respect.
对  你说得对012---Yeah. No. No, you're right.
我们去吧  好啊012--- Shall we?  Yeah.
有什么事吗012---Yes?
嗨  我是罗斯·盖勒  住在这栋公寓里012---Hi. I'm Ross Geller. I live in the building.
我是瑞秋  我很喜欢这栋公寓012---And I'm Rachel, an admirer of the building.
听说佛哈芬太太过世了012---I heard about Mrs. Verhoeven passing away,
我真的很遗憾012---and I am so sorry for your loss.
她没有过世  什么012--- She didn't pass away.  What?
我妈妈还活着012---My mother's still alive.
谢天谢地012---Oh, thank God!
她今天早上差点就过世了012---It looked like we were gonna lose her this morning,
但她是个意志力很强的老太婆012---but she's a tough old bird.
你跟她很熟吗012---Are you close with her?
当然  我们常常012---Of course. She and I would talk all the time...
在洗衣间聊天012---...in the laundry room.
你会说荷兰语吗012---You speak Dutch?
很荣幸见到我母亲的朋友（荷兰语）012---I'm very honored to meet a friend of my mother.
我会说  但说起来只会让我伤心012---You know, I would, but it's just too painful.
她真的没死012---So she's really not dead.
对  她还在坚持012---No. She's hanging in there.
你能告诉我她是在一房还是两房里坚持吗012---Could you tell me, is she hanging in in a onebedroom or a two?
宾太太  这个清洁剂太棒了012---Mrs. Bing, this tile cleaner is incredible.
你在哪里买的012---Where did you get it?
那是我自制的012---Oh, well... I make it myself.
两份的氨水加一份的柠檬汁012---It's two parts ammonia and one part lemon juice.
秘方是...012---The secret ingredient is...
你知道吗  我们才刚刚认识012---You know what? We just met.
好吧  我去洗衣间拿衣服012---Okay. I'm gonna go get the clothes from the laundry room now.
我回来后会打扫冰箱后面012---When I come back, I'll clean behind the refrigerator.
我爱她012---I love her.
我马上回来012---I'll be back in a minute.
好吧012---Okay.
看吧  我告诉过你012---See? I told you.
她偷了我的牛仔裤012---She stole my jeans!
什么012---What?
我找了一个星期  她正穿在身上012---I've been looking for them all week, and she is wearing them.
所以她偷了你的裤子012---So she stole your pants
然后当着你的面穿在身上012---and then came back and wore them in front of you?
你不明白吗  这是完美犯罪012---Don't you see? It's the perfect crime!
她一定计划了好几年012---She must have been planning this for years!
我会证明给你看012---I'll prove it to you, okay.
几周前  我穿着那条牛仔裤012---About a week ago I was wearing those jeans
我把钢笔掉在大腿上012---and I dropped a pen in my lap,
在裆部留下了墨水印子012---and it left an ink stain on the crotch.
她回来后012---When she comes back,
我就让你看看那个墨水印子012---I will find it and show you that stain!
亲爱的  卖那条牛仔裤的公司012---Honey, isn't it possible the company that sold the jeans
难道只做了一条牛仔裤吗012---made more than just the one pair?
说得有道理012---I guess.
我们应该先找找看012---So should't we give her the benefit of the doubt
再去看她的裆部吧012---before we go snooping around her crotch?
好吧  幸好我没告诉她我的秘方012---Fine. I'm just glad I didn't give her my secret ingredient.
我真的很好奇你的秘方是什么012---Out of curiosity, what is your secret ingredient?
你想得美012---Yeah.
请进  我很高兴你能过来012---Come in. I'm so glad you're here.
对  我也是012---Yeah. Me too.
但不像你那么震惊愤怒012---Not in the shaky, angry way that you are, though.
抱歉  我刚刚见过厄休拉012---Sorry. I just saw Ursula.
我得把订婚戒指拿回来012---I had to get the engagement ring back.
看到她  让我想起了一切012---Just seeing her brought it all back.
那些谎言  还有她是怎么利用我的012---All the lies, the way she used me.
我只是...012---I just...
光是看到她  我就觉得好生气...012---I get so angry, just looking at her...
我是说看到她的脸  对012--- Face.  Yeah. Yeah.
抱歉  我看到你的时候012---I'm sorry. It's just, when I look at you...
我就像是看到了她012---...I see her.
我看到她时012---And when I see her,
就会觉得很生气012---I get a little bit angry.
这样太奇怪了  等一下012--- Maybe this is too weird.  Wait.
只有我看着你的时候才会觉得生气012---There's only a problem when I look at you.
我知道了012---I got it. I got it.
不  别把你的眼睛挖出来012---No, don't tear out your eyes!
我只是要把隐形眼镜摘掉012---I was just gonna take out my lenses.
好吧  试试看012---Oh, yeah. Try that.
那样子好多了吗012---So is that better?
才怪012---Not really.
你看起来很模糊  还是很像厄休拉012---You're blurry, but you still look like Ursula.
你是"模糊的厄休拉"012---You're "Blursula."
好吧  等一下  也许012---Okay, wait. Maybe...
我暂时不看你012---If I just don't look at you for a while.
看吧  很有效果  我一点都不生气了012---See? It works. I'm not angry at all anymore.
这次约会很成功012---This is a great date!
听着  艾力克  转过来012---Look, Eric, turn around.
我喜欢你  但不应该这么纠结012---I like you, but it shouldn't be this hard.
这是我们第一次约会012---This is our first date.
第一次约会应该是兴奋刺激  火花四射012---First dates are supposed to be about excitement and electricity and...
"他刚刚摸了我的手  他是有意的吗 "012---..."He just touched my hand, did he mean to touch my hand"
还有初吻012---and you know first kisses...
第二次接吻012---Second kisses.
谢谢你的咖啡  或者说012---Thanks for the coffee, or:
谢谢你的咖啡  甘瑟（荷兰语）012---bedankt voor de koffie, Gunter.
你会说荷兰话吗  真厉害（荷兰语）012---You speak Dutch? That's cool.
你有亲戚在荷兰吗（荷兰语）012---Do you have relatives there?
我们聊完了012---Yeah, we're done.
混蛋（荷兰语）012---Ezel.
混蛋  混蛋012---Ezel. Ezel.
罗斯012---Hey, Ross. Listen.
你要去人工造浪池看新的立体巨幕电影吗012---You wanna go see that new IMAX movie on tide pools?
真的吗  才没有012--- Really?  No.
但我帮你  我跟钱德勒弄到了尼克队的门票012---But I got Knicks tickets for you, me and Chandler.
太棒了012---Sweet!
等你喝完咖啡  咱们就出发012---All right, well finish your coffee, let's go.
我得先回家一趟012---Okay. I have to stop by my place first.
你要录球赛吗  你每次都要录012---To tape the game? You do this every time, Ross.
你是不会上电视的012---You're not gonna be on TV!
不  我得去看看那间公寓是不是空出来了012---No, I have to see if this apartment became available.
你要换公寓吗012---You're switching apartments?
不是我  是瑞秋要搬家012---It's not for me, it's for Rachel.
她已经有公寓了012---Rachel has an apartment.
宝宝一出生  她就要搬家012---Yeah, but when the baby comes, she's gonna wanna move.
真的吗  对012--- She is?  Yeah.
你该不会希望她跟宝宝住在你那里吧012---You didn't expect her to live there with the baby, did you?
我没仔细想过012---I guess I didn't really think about it.
混蛋012---Ezel.
甘瑟  你才是个混蛋012---Hey, Gunther, you're an ezel.
你和混蛋性交了（荷兰语）012---You have sex with donkeys.
该死012---Damn it!
你的牛仔裤很漂亮  谢谢012--- Nice jeans.  Oh, thanks.
我喜欢你的上衣  你别想得手012--- I like your top.  Oh. You're not getting it.
发生了什么事  我睡着了012--- What happened?  Oh. I fell asleep!
我想要午休一下012---I was thinking about taking my lunch break.
你能擦一下橱柜上面吗012---Will you do the top of the cabinets?
那会让你午餐时食欲大增012---That'll work up your appetite for lunch.
好吧012---All right.
你好啊012---Hello.
发生了什么事012---What's going on?
抱歉  我以前没请过女佣012---I'm sorry. I've never had a maid before.
这样做不合适吗012---Is this not okay?
球赛怎么样012---How was the game?
还不错  我吃太多了012---It was okay. I ate way too much.
我跟罗斯谈过  他说你在找新公寓012---I was talking to Ross, and he said you were looking for a new place.
对  我希望能搬到对街去012---Yeah. Hopefully across the street.
如果那些荷兰人愿意让出公寓012---If certain Dutch people would just let go.
我希望你留下来012---I was kind of hoping you'd stay.
乔伊  我得搬走  这里容不下一个宝宝012---Joey, I have to go. There's no room for a baby here.
容不下  宝宝也就这么大吧012---No room? It's a baby. It's, like, this big.
你可以把他放在这里012---You could put it over here.
或是这里  很可爱吧012---Or we could put it right here. It's cute, right?
或是这里  你根本就不会注意到他012---Or put it over here. You wouldn't even notice it.
"宝宝在哪里 "  "他就在..."012---"Where's the baby?" "Oh, it's right over..."
亲爱的  问题不仅在于要把他放在哪里012---Honey, it's not just a matter of where you put it.
宝宝会让你的生活翻天覆地012---A baby changes everything.
他们总是哭个不停012---They cry all the time.
如果你带女孩回家012---Imagine bringing home some girl
想跟她上床时  宝宝却哭个不停012---and trying to score with a screaming baby around.
我可以接受这个挑战  算不上什么难事012---I could use a challenge. It's getting pretty easy.
你要我留下来  真的很贴心012---It's so sweet that you want me to stay,
但我不能那么对你012---but I can't do that to you.
那样会毁了你的生活012---It would disrupt your entire life.
只是...012---It's just...
我很喜欢跟你一起住012---I love living with you so much.
我希望一切都不必改变  我知道012--- I wish things didn't have to change.  I know.
这件事全怪罗斯012---You know, I blame Ross for this.
我也有点怪他012---I do too, a little bit.
我会想念你的012---I'm gonna miss you.
你是我遇过最辣的室友012---You're the hottest roommate I ever had.
不行  我得走了  有人预约我去按摩012---Oh, no, I have to go. I have a massage appointment.
别  留下来  我们继续吧012---No, stay here. We'll keep doing this.
我可以付钱给你012---I'll pay you.
不行  之前我因为这个惹上了大麻烦012---No, I've gotten in trouble for that before.
待会见  没问题012--- I'll see you later?  Absolutely.
我喜欢你的吻技012---I love the way you kiss.
真的吗  那是我最逊的方面012---Really? That's the thing I'm worst at!
你等着瞧吧012---You'll see.
我觉得布兰达需要加薪  为什么012--- Hey. I think Brenda needs a raise.  How come?
因为我把头放在她的双腿之间012---Because I put my head between her legs.
为了看她的裤子吗  那是我的裤子012--- To see her pants?  They're my pants!
你确定吗  你看到墨水印子了吗012---Are you sure? Did you see the stain?
没有  我才刚刚就位  就眼前一片漆黑012---No. I was getting into position, and then everything went dark.
她没有偷我们的东西  你能不能算了012---She is not stealing from us, okay. Will you let this go?
好吧012---Fine.
她穿着我的胸罩  天啊012--- She's wearing my bra!  Oh, dear God!
我的粉红色小花胸罩  我认得那条肩带012---My pink, flowered bra! I recognize the strap!
那你没意识到自己疯了吗012---Yet you don't recognize that you're crazy?
我有个计划012---Here's the plan.
我先离开  你去看布兰达的胸罩012---I'm going to leave, and you're gonna look at Brenda's bra.
我也有个计划012---Here's another plan.
不要012---No.
本可以由我来做  但她以为我喜欢她012---I would do it, but she thinks I'm attracted to her.
为什么012---Why?
你不知道刚刚我的头插到哪里了吗012---Did you not hear where my head was?
我们是一帮的  在这件事上应该同进退012---Come on, come on. We're a team. We're in this together.
我担心陪审团也会那么认为012---I fear a jury will see it the same way.
就算是为了我012---Do this for me.
我常抓到你在瞄女人胸部012---I catch you looking at womers breasts all the time.
你看到了吗012---You see that?
这样难道你看不到吗012---Do you see this?
好吧  我了解你的意思012---All right, yes. Okay. I get your point.
但如果那不是你的胸罩012---But if it's not your bra,
你能让她接着安心打扫吗012---will you just let the woman clean the apartment?
没问题012---Yes. Absolutely.
是不是我的你能分辨出来  因为在右罩杯上012---You'll know it's mine because on the right cup,
蕾丝的部分  有明显的开线012---the lacey part, there's a very noticeable rip.
你需要买新衣服了012---You need new clothes.
她还好吗  情况看起来不妙012--- Hi. How is she?  It's not looking good.
我带了一些花过来给她012---Well, I brought her some bloemen.
你太体贴了  你要跟她送别吗012---That's so sweet. Would you like to come in and say goodbye?
那对她来说一定意义重大012---I'm sure it would mean a lot to her.
这我还真没想到012---Oh, I don't know that it would.
她几乎不记得任何人了  那么好吧012--- Well, her memory is pretty much gone.  All right, then.
欢迎你回来012---Welcome back.
我们要继续吗012---Shall we pick up from where we left off?
今天下午过后  我还没缓过劲来012---I don't know. I'm still tired from this afternoon.
为什么  我们做爱了012--- Why?  The sex.
什么  你跟我做爱了012--- What sex?  Our sex.
我们没做爱啊012---We didn't have sex.
如果我没跟你做爱012---If I didn't have sex with you,
我一定是跟一个长得跟你很像...012---I had sex with somebody that looked an awful lot like...
不会吧012---Oh, no. Oh, no.
不会吧012---No, no, no.
你跟厄休拉做爱了  做了一点012--- You had sex with Ursula?  A little bit.
她走进来  我以为她是你  我吻了她...012---She walked in, I thought she was you and I kissed her and...
你没注意到衣服不一样吗012---You didn't notice different clothes?
我看到你太兴奋了012---I was just so excited to see you.
这真的是太奇怪了012---You know what? This is too weird.
不会的  我不想失去你012---No, it's not. I don't wanna lose you.
在做爱的时候012---It's like I was saying to Ursula
我以为厄休拉是你  我对她说...012---when I was making love to her and I thought she was you...
对  那太奇怪了012---Yeah. It's too weird.
那就到此为止吧012---So I guess this is it.
好012---Yeah.
或许这是最好的办法012---Maybe it's for the best.
你的味道跟她一样  对  你也是012--- You smell just like her.  Yeah, so do you.
你在做什么  我在屈伸012--- What are you doing?  I'm leaning.
我都在这里做屈伸运动012---This is where I lean.
好吧012---Okay.
布兰达  有蜜蜂  什么012--- Brenda, a bee!  What?
它飞进你上衣里了012---Yes! It's flown into your blouse,
你最好快解开扣子  免得被叮伤012---and you better undo your buttons lest it sting you.
我想我知道这是怎么一回事了  是吗012--- I think I know what's going on here.  You do?
你太太是女同志  我知道你一定很难受012---Look, I know it must be hard that your wife is a lesbian...
但这是不对的  你结婚了012---...but it's wrong. You're married.
我完全了解  太好了012--- I totally understand.  Okay, good.
我能看看你的胸罩吗012---Could I just see your bra?
你怎么会有那条牛仔裤  是你送我的012--- Where'd you get those jeans?  You gave them to me.
我才没有  好吧  是我自己拿的012--- No, I didn't!  All right, I took them.
我以为你不会介意012---I figured it'd be okay
因为在裆部的地方有一大块墨水印子012---because you've got a big ink stain on the crotch.
不要啊  你也拿走了我的胸罩吗012---Oh, no! Did you take my bra too?
什么胸罩012---What bra?

你是说你正穿的这件胸罩吗012---You mean the one you're wearing?
我不干了012---I quit!
可以理解012---Sounds about right.

我只是做一下大致构想012---This is just to give you an idea.
我们可以在这里装拉帘  给宝宝留有隐私012---We can put screens here so that the baby has privacy...
在摇篮上面装个音乐铃012---...and maybe a mobile over the crib...
这是宝宝监控器012---...and here's a baby monitor

天啊  你帮宝宝买了企鹅宝宝012---Oh, my God! And you gave the baby Hugsy!

快把它交给我吧  免得你误会了012---Why don't I hold on to him so there's no confusion.
乔伊  宝宝会哭的  那会非常地吵012---Joey, the baby is gonna be crying. It's gonna be loud.
我本身就很吵  他会整晚不睡012--- I'm loud.  It's gonna be up all night.
我也会  他会大便012--- I'm up all night.  It's gonna poop.

那你带回家的姑娘们怎么办012---What about all the women you wanna bring home?
如果我把一个姑娘带回家012---Look. If I'm bringing home a woman
她连和宝宝相处都做不到012---who can't stand being around a baby...
那或许我根本不该跟那个姑娘在一起012---...then maybe I don't wanna be with that woman.
或许我们该在酒吧的洗手间里做爱012---Or maybe we'll do it in the bathroom of the club!
乔伊  你确定吗012---Joey, are you sure?
对  听着  我知道有时候会很辛苦012---Yeah. Look, I know sometimes it'll be hard, okay...

好吧012---Okay!
那位老太大过世了  我怎么会知道呢012---Well, the old lady died. And how do I know?
因为她的遗愿是给她最后一吻012---Because her dying wish was for one last kiss.
但我不在乎012---But I don't care,
因为你拿到那间公寓了  太棒了012---because you got the apartment. Yes!
