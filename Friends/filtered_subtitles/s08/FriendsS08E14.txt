怎么了012---What's up?
我又忘拿吉他了012---I left my guitar here again.
好吧  没问题  好012--- Okay. No problem.  Okay.
好了  拿去吧012---Okay. Here you go.
好  好012--- Okay.  Okay.
怎么了  你想一起玩点什么吗012--- What?  You want to hang out or something?
菲比  你来的不是时候012---Phoebe. You caught me at a bad time.
你跟钱德勒...  没错012--- Are you and Chandler...?  Yes. Exactly.
好吧  要我帮你们伴奏吗  不必了012--- Okay. Do you guys want me to play for you?  No.
菲比  你好吗012---Hey, Pheebs, what's up?
你问了一个引人深思的问题  钱德勒·宾012---You ask an intriguing question, Chandler Bing.
天啊  你竟然请人帮你按摩012---Oh, my God! You're getting a massage?
你从来不让我帮你按摩012---You never let me massage you.
菲比  我可以解释012---Phoebe, I can explain.
你说过你讨厌按摩012---You told me you hate massages.
去买邮票  取干洗的衣服012---Buy stamps. Pick up dry cleaning.
别让菲比进来012---Don't let Phoebe in.
真不敢相信  你背着我这么做多久了012---I can't believe this! How long has this been going on?
亚丽珊卓...012---Well, Alexandra has...
她还有名字啊012---It has a name?
菲比  别生气012---Phoebe, don't get upset.
好吧  太迟了  我要走了012---Okay. Oh, too late! I'm leaving.
来吧  钱德勒  我们走012---Come on, Chandler, let's go.
我还是...012---Well, I thought I'd...
好吧  管它呢012---Yeah, what the hell.
《老友记》  第八季  第14集  神秘的储藏室012---Friends S08E14 The One With The Secret Closet
好了  继续用力  加油012---Oh okay, okay! One more push! One more push!
加油  亲爱的  就快生出来了012---Come on honey, we're almost there! We're almost there!
乔伊  真高兴我们能在一起012---Joey, I'm happy things worked out for us
我们就要有自己的孩子了012---and we're having this baby together.
我如此爱你012---I love you so much.
我也爱你012---I love you too.
希望现在说这种话不会太煞风景...012---I hope it's not an inappropriate time to say this...
你是我最棒的性伴侣012---...you're the best sex I've ever had.
这种话随时都可以说012---That's always appropriate.
来吧  继续用力  继续用力012---Okay, come on, one more push. One more push.
好了012---There we go.
你们的漂亮宝宝012---Here is your beautiful baby.
恭喜012---Congratulations.
希望你做爸爸比做朋友称职012---I hope you're a better father than you are a friend!
乔伊  怎么了012--- Joey! Joey!  What?
发生了什么事  快来摸摸我的肚子012--- What's going on?  Come feel my belly.
这是宝宝第一次踢我012---The baby's kicking for the first time.
你过来摸摸嘛012---Will you please come feel this?
真的吗  对012--- Really?  Yes.
要不还是你...012---You know what? Maybe you...
还是你过来吧  我没穿裤子012---Maybe you should come to me. I'm not wearing any bottoms.
天啊012---Oh, my God.
太不可思议了012---It's unbelievable!
她踢得好用力  她就像是...012---Wow, she is kicking so much. She's like...
那个讨厌的女足球员是谁来着012---Who's that kind of annoying girl soccer player?
米亚·汉姆  米亚·汉姆012--- Mia Hamm?  Mia Hamm!
太神奇了  一只手抓好床单  乔伊012--- It's amazing.  One hand on the sheet, Joe.
抱歉012---Sorry.
宝贝  亲爱的012--- Hey, babe.  Hey, honey.
刚收到巴伯跟菲伊宾送我们的结婚礼物012---We got a wedding gift from Bob and Faye Bing.
他们不喜欢我们  对吧012---They don't like us, do they?
谁说买不到六块以下的高级酒碗012---Who says you can't get a nice punch bowl for under $6?
我们可以退回去012---Maybe we can take it back.
上面都没写地址  怎么知道要退到哪里去012---No, it doesn't say where it came from. Where would we return it?
何不从阳台把它丢到街上012---How about to the street, from the balcony?
还是找个地方摆着吧012---Why don't we just find a place for it?
放在那个储藏室里怎样012---How about that cabinet?
那是放罐头食物的012---No. That's for canned goods.
你忘了每样东西都要放在固定位置吗012---Have you forgotten everything you learned at orientation?
那浴室旁边的储藏室呢012---How about the closet by the bathroom?
让我来吧  不  我来就行了012--- Okay. Let me do it.  No, I'll do it.
亲爱的  你得学会放手012---Honey, you have to learn to sit down and relax
偶尔把事情交给我来做012---and let your husband take care of things once and awhile.
上锁了  你得帮帮我012---It's locked. You have to help me.
为什么上锁了012---Why is it locked?
没有为什么  我把私人物品放在那里012---No reason. I keep private things in there.
我在这里住了一阵子了012---I've been here a while,
从没见过里面放的是什么东西012---and I've never seen what's inside that closet.
里面到底放了什么012---What is in there?
女性用品012---Feminine stuff.
你别以为说是女性用品就能唬住我012---Don't try to make me uncomfortable with feminine stuff!
钱德勒  那里面没有你喜欢的东西012---Chandler, there is nothing in there that concerns you!
你要是爱我  就忘了这件事吧012---If you love me, you'll just let it go.
好吧  谢谢012--- Fine.  Thank you.
爱你012---Love you.
钱德勒  今天天气真好啊012---Hello, Chandler. Lovely day, huh?
那谁012---You.
如果这话有帮助的话012---Phoebe, if it helps,
亚丽珊卓只帮她做了三年按摩012---Alexandra's only been massaging Monica for three years.
我说如果有帮助的话012---If! I said, if it helps.
你为什么不让我帮你按摩012---Why won't you let me massage you?
我会觉得尴尬012---I mean I'd just... I'd be selfconscious.
你是我朋友  我得脱光衣服012---You're my friend. I'd be naked.
莫妮卡  我们住在一起那么多年012---Monica, we lived together for years.
我看过你没穿衣服的样子012---I've seen you naked.
那不一样  我们当时是室友012---That's different. We were roommates.
你什么时候见过012---And when?
我对人体很好奇012---I'm curious about the human body.
菲比  你肯定明白我为什么会觉得别扭012---Come on, Phoebe. You can understand why this would be weird for me.
我是职业按摩师  技术一流012---I'm a professional and I'm really good.
如果你觉得不舒服  我就住手012---If you're uncomfortable, we can stop.
给我一个机会  拜托012---Just give me a chance. Please? Okay?
好吧  如果你这么看重这点的话012---Okay. If it means that much to you.
没错012---It does.
如果你没法分享你的厨艺  你会有什么感觉012---How would you feel if you couldn't share your cooking?
如果罗斯不能教我们012---Or imaging how Ross would feel
龙的知识他会有什么感觉012---if he couldn't teach us about dragons.
是恐龙  有什么区别012--- Dinosaurs.  Potato, potahto.
罗斯  宝宝会动了012---Ross, the baby's kicking.
什么  是吗012---What? It is?
她现在没在踢我012---It's not kicking right now.
不过我们倒是很想看你再摘一次手套012---Although we would love to see you do that again.
她什么时候动的  怎么回事012---When? When was it kicking? What happened?
昨晚我感觉到了  就跑到乔伊房间012---Last night. I just felt it and I went into Joey's room,
他在睡觉  但是没做梦012--- and he was sleeping.  A dreamless sleep.
天啊  宝宝会动了  真是太棒了012---My God, the baby's kicking. That's great.
不过我希望宝宝第一次胎动的时候012---Although I kind of wish I would have been there to feel
我能陪在你身边012---the kicking for the first time.
如果你真的想摸  我的肚子正在咕咕叫呢012---I got some stuff going on if you want to feel.
我不想再错过宝宝的一举一动了012---Look, I don't want to miss any more baby stuff.
这是我的新传呼号码012---So here's my pager number, okay?
只要发生跟宝宝有关的事立刻通知我012---Anytime anything pregnancyrelated happens, use it.
我随时恭候  凌晨三点也无所谓012---I'll be there. I don't care if it's three in the morning,
哪怕你只是想吃冰淇淋012---and all you want is ice cream.
我能抄一份吗012---Can I get a copy of that?
你裹上床单吗  对012--- Are you under the sheet?  Yes.
好了  我们开始吧012---Great, let's begin.
力道还可以吧012---How's the pressure?
很不错  菲比  你确实很厉害012---It's nice. Wow, Phoebe, you are good.
这是明摆着的事  不过还是谢谢夸奖012---Stating the obvious, but thank you.
一点都不奇怪  对吧  没错012--- And it's not weird, is it?  No.
没错  好好享受吧012---That's right, you just enjoy.
爽012---Oh, yeah!
爽啊  好吧012--- Oh, yeah!  Okay.
天啊  菲比012---Oh, God, Phoebe!
就这样  就是那里012---That's it! That's it, right there!
我没想打开你的储藏室012---I wasn't trying to open your closet.
我发誓  我没想打开你的储藏室012---I wasn't trying to open your closet, I swear.
莫妮卡管你很严  对吧012---Monica runs a pretty tight ship here, doesn't she?
你在做什么012---What are you doing?
莫妮卡有个秘密储藏室  她不肯让我看012---Monica has a secret closet. She won't let me see what's in it.
为什么  我不知道012--- Why not?  I don't know!
她能有什么要藏着不让我看的012---What could she possibly be hiding in here that I can't see?!
我不知道012---I don't know.
我敢说是理查德012---I bet it's Richard.
她为什么要把理查德关在里面012---Why would Monica be keeping Richard in here?
我的第一反应是012---Off the top of my head...
或者她想鱼与熊掌兼得012---...maybe she's having her cake and eating it too.
你是"熊掌"  理查德只是"鱼"012---You being the "cake," Richard being the "too."
或是...  又来了012--- Or...  And here we go.
我看过一部电影里有一扇门012---I saw this movie once where there was a door
没有人知道里面藏了什么012---Nobody knew what was behind it.
最后他们把门打开之后012---When they finally got it open,
数以百万只虫子蜂拥而出012---millions and millions and millions of bugs came pouring out
以人肉为食012---and they feasted on human flesh.
尊重你老婆的隐私要不了你的命012---It wouldn't kill you to respect your wife's privacy!
满是虫子的破储藏室012---Stupid closet full of bugs!
乔伊  我感觉怪怪的  不太对头012---Joey. Joey, something feels weird and not good weird.
我不...012---I don't...
别担心  没事012---Do not worry, ok?
我妹妹怀孕的时候012---When my sisters were pregnant...
她们有各种奇怪的感觉012---they got every weird feeling in the book,
结果根本没事012---and it was always nothing.
真的吗  没错012--- Really?  Absolutely.
但我们得到医院检查一下  确保没事012---But we'll stop by the hospital just to be sure.
我在路上呼罗斯  好012--- I'll page Ross on the way.  Okay. God!
瑞秋  看着我012---Okay Rach, Rach, Rach look at me, look at me,
一切都会没事的  相信我012---everything's gonna be fine, trust me. Okay.
来  握着我的手  我们走吧012---Come on. Take my hand. Here we go.
我快骨折了012---Crushing bones!
还好我们是要去医院012---Good thing we're going to a hospital.
怎么样  她没事012--- So?  She's fine.
她出现了假性子宫收缩012---She's experiencing BraxtonHicks contractions,
引起了子宫壁的轻度不适012---mild discomfort caused by contractions in the uterine wall.
轻度不适012---Mild discomfort?
这么说你也出现过假性宫缩喽012---So I take it you've had one of these Braxton thingies?
一切都正常吗  对012--- But everything's normal?  Absolutely.
她和宝宝都没有危险  对012--- And there's no danger to her or the baby?  No.
如果不明情况  宫缩会引起不安情绪012---Contractions can be unnerving if you don't know what they are,
但她没事012---but she's fine.
谢谢你  医生012---Thank you, doctor.
谢谢你这么好心冷静012---And thank you for being nice and calm.
我一点都不冷静012---Calm? I wasn't calm!
我从来没有这么害怕过012---I've never been more scared in my entire life.
你说一切都会没事的012---But wait you said everything was gonna be okay.
我知道什么  我又不是医生012---What do I know? I'm not a doctor.
但一切都没事  我很好啊  你确定012--- But everything is okay. I'm fine.  You sure?
对  我真希望那个医生的子宫也会收缩012---Yes. I got half a mind to contract that doctor's uterus though.
轻度不适  他没经历过  有什么资格发言012---Mild discomfort! What's he talking about?
你没事吧  没事012--- Is everything okay?  Yes, everything's fine.
你呼我说"赶到医院来"  发生了什么事012---Your page said, "Come to the hospital." What happened?
她出现了假性子宫收缩012---Something called Braxton Hicks contraction.
那没什么大不了的012---Thank god. That's no big deal.
很多女人都不会有感觉012---Most women don't feel them.
没有子宫就没有发言权012---No uterus, no opinion.
你买糖果干嘛  你呼我的时候012--- What's with the candy?  When you beeped me,
我正在电影院买零食012---I was at the concession stand at the movie theater.
你自己去看电影吗  蒙娜012--- You went to the movies by yourself?  Mona!
我得回检查室去012---I gotta go back in there.
发生了什么事012---Why? What's wrong?
没事  我只是得回去...012---No, everything's fine. I just gotta go back...
不  告诉我  怎么了012---No, really, tell me. What's up?
我把内裤落在里面了012---Look, I forgot my underwear.
谢谢你送她来医院012---Thanks so much for bringing her to the hospital.
别放在心上  没有什么大不了012---Don't worry about it. No big deal.
但应该由我送她来  我毕竟是孩子他爸012---But still, it should have been me. I'm the dad.
如果还有疑问012---If you have any questions,
这是假性宫缩的资料  谢谢012--- Here's information on Braxton Hicks.  Thanks.
对了  你送她过来是对的012---By the way, you did the right thing by bringing her in.
你会是个好爸爸012---You'll make a wonderful father.
我没有这家伙厉害  他买了糖果012---Hey, not as good as this guy. He brought Twizzlers.
一定会有办法012---There has got to be a way.
别紧张  寇克船长012---Easy there, Captain Kirk.{\r}\N{\fnTahoma\fs10\bord1\shad1\1c&HC0C0C0&\b0}
你有发夹吗  有012--- Do you have a bobby pin?  Yeah.
不对  我不是九岁的小女孩012---Oh, no, wait. I'm not a 9yearold girl.
那为什么你投球的时候很像012---Then why do you throw like one?
或许莫妮卡有发夹012---Maybe Monica has a bobby pin.
是啊  "莫妮卡"什么都有012---Oh, sure, "Monica."
你暗恋瑞秋那事怎么样了012---So, how's the hideously inappropriate crush on Rachel coming?
很不错  我该随时做好自杀的准备012---Really good. I should be ready to kill myself any day now.
你这么快就找到了012---Well, you sure found that quick.
我真希望对瑞秋的感觉能淡去012---I wish I didn't feel this way about Rachel any more.
我希望一切能恢复正常012---I wish things could go back to normal.
我喜欢跟她一起住012---I love living with her,
在怀孕期间照顾她感觉也很棒012---and helping out with the baby is amazing.
但罗斯会觉得自己像个局外人012---But now I think Ross feels left out.
我送瑞秋去医院012---When I took Rachel to the hospital,
医生还以为我是孩子他爸012---the doctor thought I was the father.
罗斯的表情很不自然012---You should have seen the look on Ross' face.
我不知道自己在干嘛012---By the way, I have no idea what I'm doing here.
我只知道锁越捅越紧012---For all I know, I'm just locking it more.
你试过用信用卡吗012---Did you try opening it with a credit card?
好点子  好012--- That's a good idea.  Okay.
罗斯有点失落是吧012---So Ross is kind of bummed, huh?
我感觉很过意不去  那不是你的错012--- I feel terrible.  It's not your fault.
不然你要怎么做  不送她去医院吗012---What are you gonna do, not take her to the hospital?
你没做错事012---You're doing nothing wrong.
但你不该爱上012---Except for harboring an all consuming love
怀着他孩子的女人012---for the woman whose carrying his baby.
理查德  如果你在里面012---Richard, if you're in there,
麻烦把信用卡递给我012---could you pass me my credit card?
你昨天的技术真的很棒012---I gotta tell you, yesterday was amazing.
按摩感觉舒服极了012---That massage felt so good.
我懂的012---No, I got that.
你能每星期帮我按摩一次吗012---So, what do you say we make it a weekly appointment?
好吧012---Okay.
但你得知道  我的时薪涨到两百块了012---You should know though, I've raised my rates to $200 an hour.
好吧  我是说五百块012--- Okay.  I mean 500.
什么  六百块012--- What?  600.
怎么回事012---What's going on?
我给你按摩你的时候  你会发出叫床声012---You make sex noises when you get massaged.
什么  我一下子就乱了手脚012--- What?  Yeah, and it really freaked me out!
之后我想用力弄痛你012---And after a while I even tried to hurt you
结果你叫得更大声012---and it just spurred you on.
你疯了吧012---What? You're crazy.
我的叫声一点都不淫荡012---There's nothing sexual about the noises I make.
是吗  这样一点都不淫荡吗012---Really? There's nothing sexual about this?
天啊012---Oh, God!
你看什么看012---What are you looking at?
我是说  嗨012---I mean, hi.
这简直太丢脸了012---This is so embarrassing.
我再也不按摩了012---Oh, my god. I'm never getting a massage again.
别让这个问题害你放弃按摩012---No, you can't let this stop you from getting massages.
我有很多客人012---Look, I have lots of clients
也会发出那种叫声012---that make the same noises as you do.
真的吗  他们不是客人  是床伴012--- Really?  Well, not clients. Lovers.
我们再试一次012---We'll try it again.
再来找我  我们想办法解决012---Come back, and we'll work through it.
你确定  对012--- You sure?  Yes.
好吧  太棒了  失陪一下012--- I guess.  Great! Now, if you'll just excuse me.
你刚才听到你中意的声音了吗012---So did you hear something you liked?
罗斯  你看  我学到了新把戏012---Hey, Ross, check it out! I learned a new trick.
我帮你买了午餐012---Hey, I brought you some lunch.
你真的太贴心了  美味啊012---Oh, that's so sweet of you. Oh, yum.
你放了腌黄瓜吗  对012--- Did you put pickles on this?  Well, yeah.
怎么  瑞秋  怎么了012---What? What? Rach, what?
发生了什么事012---What's going on?
我帮她带了最爱吃的腌黄瓜金枪鱼三明治012---I made her favorite, tuna salad with pickles.
腌黄瓜  那会让她恶心012---Pickle? Pickle makes her sick.
让她吃腌黄瓜就像让我吃沙拉012---Giving her pickle is like giving me salad.
抱歉  我不知道  你还好吗012---I'm sorry Rach, I didn't know. Are you gonna be okay?
我没事012---Yeah, I'll be fine,
趁我不在  谁能赶紧把那个三明治012---But could someone please make sure that sandwich is gone
给解决掉  我在吃了012--- when I get out there?  I'm on it!
怎么会这样012---I can't believe this.
我不该惹她恶心的012---I shouldn't be the one making her throw up.
放轻松  罗斯  谁都可能做出这种事012---Relax, Ross. It could happen to anyone.
你就不会  因为你了解她012---Yeah, not to you. 'Cause you know this stuff.
我什么都不知道  亏我还是孩子他爸012---I don't know any of it and I'm the father.
真希望自己能更多地参与其中012---I wish I could be more involved, you know?
谁帮我记下来012---Well, if anyone is keeping score,
我绝不会再吃金枪鱼了012---I no longer eat tuna.
我能跟你们谈一谈吗012---Can I talk to you guys for a second?
可以啊  怎么了012--- Yeah.  What's up?
坐吧  我想谈谈我们现在的情况012---Sit down. I wanna talk about our situation.
你要跟我们分手吗012---Are you breaking up with us?
我想说的是...012---The thing is...
因为我跟瑞秋一起住  我参与了不少事情012---...because I live with Rachel, I'm here for a lot of stuff.
而罗斯却不断错过  所以012---And Ross is missing everything. So...
怎么了012---Yeah?
也许你们两个应该住在一起012---Maybe you two should live together.
你要我搬出去吗  你不想让我住在这里了012---Are you asking me to move out? You don't want me here?
不是  我喜欢跟你一起住  只不过...012---No, I love living with you. It just seems that...
要找室友  也最好是孩子他爸012---...if you're gonna have a roommate, it may as well be the father.
乔伊  我觉得罗斯不希望012---But, Joey, I don't think Ross wants me to move into his apartment
我搬过去干扰他的生活012---and disrupt his life like that.
或许他希望我搬过去012---Or he does.
我很乐意照顾你跟宝宝012---I would love to be around for you and the baby.
我们可以先试一阵子012---We can just try it, like on a temporary basis.
但咱们有太多过往012---But Ross, it's you and me.
对  但我们不会有感情牵扯012---Sure, but it wouldn't be anything romantic.
我在和蒙娜交往  该死  又把蒙娜忘了012---I'm dating Mona. Damn it, Mona!
我跟她约好一小时前见面012---I was supposed to meet her an hour ago.
我这是怎么了012---What is wrong with me?
你们意下如何012---So, what do you think?
我不知道  那很疯狂吧  不012--- I don't know. Is it crazy?  No, no, it's not...
