菲比  快看窗边那个男的012---Phoebe. Will you check out that guy by the window.
他矮得出奇012---He's awfully short.
而且我觉得他在自言自语012---And I think he's talking to himself.
老实说  他的床上功夫不怎么样012---And to be completely honest, he's not that good in bed.
我最近是怎么了012---What is wrong with me lately?
我对看到的每个男人都心动012---It's like, every guy I see.
譬如说那个男的012---I mean, look at that guy, for example.
他不是我喜欢的那一型012---That's not someone I would be attracted to.
但凭我现在的感觉012---But right now, with the way I'm feeling,
我一心想撕开他的运动裤跟腰包012---all I want to do is rip off his sweatpants and fanny pack.
等一下012---Wait a second!
你怀孕大概四个月了吧012---This is about the fourth month of your pregnancy, right?
对  这再正常不过了012--- Yeah.  This is completely normal.
怀孕四个月时  你的荷尔蒙分泌会失控012---Around the fourth month, your hormones start going crazy.
真的吗  你当时也是这样吗  没错012--- Really? So this has happened to you?  Absolutely! Yeah.
别忘了我怀的是三胞胎012---And keep in mind now, I was carrying triplets.
从医学上来说  我的欲望要比你强三倍012---So in medical terms, I was thrice as randy.
原来是这么一回事012---Wow, this explains so much!
上周末我走遍每一家商店012---Last weekend, I went from store to store,
坐在圣诞老人的大腿上012---sitting on Santas' laps.
对  我记得我当时想要从健身房012---Yeah, I remember trying to steal a cardboard cutout...
偷走艾凡德·霍利菲尔德的人形立牌012---...of Evander Holyfield from a Foot Locker.
明天我得去看医生  我到时问问她012---Well, I go see my doctor tomorrow. I'll ask her about this.
或许她可以开个药给我吃012---Maybe she can give me a pill or something.
对  你正是需要吃药  对症"下药"012---Yeah, that's what you need. A good pill.
《老友记》  第八季  第11集  罗斯向前跨了一大步012---Friends S08E11 The One With Ross'Big Step Forward
我把我们到洛克菲勒中心的照片洗出来了012---I got our pictures developed from Rockefeller Center.
太棒了  乔伊  你想看我跟蒙娜012---Great. Hey, Joey, want to check out pictures
去溜冰的照片吗012---of me and Mona iceskating?
换做平常我会想看012---Ordinarily, I would love to,
但现在我真的好忙012---but I am just swamped right now.
那个怪怪的咸酥饼小贩012---Where are the pictures that
帮我们合拍的照片在哪里012---that creepy pretzel vendor took of us together?
对  或许在最后面012---Oh, yeah. Probably at the end.
天啊  他只拍了我的胸部012---Oh, my God! All he took were pictures of my breasts.
我也想看照片012---I'm missing picture time!
她长得也不错耶  罗斯012---You know, she has a face, Ross.
我们这张合照很不错012--- Okay, here's a good one of us.
这张真的很棒  看起来很像节日贺卡012---Wow, that is a good one! It looks like a holiday card.
中间有树  还有溜冰客和雪012---With the tree in the middle and the skaters and the snow.
每年我都说要寄节日贺卡012---Every year, I say I'm gonna send out
但从来都没着手去做012---holiday cards and I never do it.
你要跟我一起寄这张卡片吗012---Do you want to send this one out together?
一起寄我们的合照给大家012---Together? Like, to people?
对  "佳节愉快  蒙娜跟罗斯上"012---Yeah. "Happy holidays, from Mona and Ross."
一定会很棒  对吧012---It'll be cute, okay?
好吧012---Okay.
我得去上班了012---I gotta get to work.
待会打电话给我  没问题012--- Call me later?  Sure, sure.
大家再见  再见012--- Bye, guys.  Bye.
恭喜  你刚刚结婚了012---Congratulations! You just got married!
我知道  你敢相信吗012---I know. Can you believe that?
抱歉  一张贺卡有什么大不了的012---I'm sorry. What's the big deal about a holiday card?
已婚夫妻跟家人才会一起寄照片012---Married couples send out cards. Families send out cards.
约会了几个月的情侣012---People who have been dating for a couple of months
不会一起寄卡片012---don't send out cards.
她疯了吗012---What is she, crazy?
你说的人可是你老婆012---That's your wife you're talking about!
宾  还有宾太太012---Bing! And the Bingette!
老婆  你记得我老板道格吧  记得012--- Oh, honey, you remember my boss, Doug.  Yes. Hi.
好消息  我已经离婚了012---Hi. So, good news! The divorce is final.
我今天早上签了文件012---I signed the papers this a.m.
我不知道你跟卡拉离婚了  我很遗憾012---I didn't know you and Kara divorced. I'm sorry.
遗憾  我终于可以脱离苦海了012---Sorry? I finally chewed my leg out of that bear trap.
不过还是恭喜你们012---Congratulations to you guys, though.
我们感情好着呢012---No legchewing for us, sir.
等着瞧吧012---Well, give it time.
你们刚结婚  我刚离婚  该好好庆祝一番012---So the divorce, the marriage, we got a lot to celebrate.
我们何不明晚一起吃晚餐012---How about we all go out to dinner tomorrow night.
我想不出来我们明晚要做什么事012---I can't think of anything we're doing.
为什么我想不出来我们明晚要做什么事012---Why can't I think of anything we're doing?
那就定在明晚  我六点应该能离开法庭012---Tomorrow night it is. I should be out of court by 6.
他们一直拿性骚扰案扔给我012---They keep throwing sexual harassment cases at me...
我总能把他们打得毫无退路012---...and I keep knocking them out of the park!
好吧  明天见012---Okay, see you tomorrow.
你要知道  我们明天不能跟他见面012---Just so you know, we're not seeing him tomorrow.
我没办法再跟他共度一个夜晚012---I can't spend another evening with that man.
你记得他在我们的婚礼上做了什么吗012---Do you remember how he behaved at our wedding?
不记得  那是因为我们没有邀请他012--- No.  That's because he wasn't invited.
因为他在我们的订婚派对上为非作歹012---Because of the way he behaved at our engagement party.
对  小便直接喷中了冰雕  对吧012---Oh, yeah! Urine cuts right through an ice sculpture, doesn't it?
我去过照相馆了  你看012---Hi! I went by the photo shop. Take a look.
这是卡片的初稿  你觉得怎样012---Here is a mockup of our card. What do you think?
真的很棒012---Wow, that's great.
你觉得我们该写上"爱你们的罗斯跟蒙娜"吗012---Do you think it should say, "Love, Ross and Mona"?
我们还没有对彼此说过"爱"012---Well, we haven't said that to each other yet...
但我猜跟其他人说说应该没关系012---...but I guess it's okay to say it to other people.
你要多少张012---How many did you want?
我要100张  100张012--- I'll get 100. A hundred?
那我就要...012---Well, I guess I'll take...
蒙娜012---Mona?
我不确定印卡片这件事妥不妥012---I'm not sure about the whole card thing.
真的吗  为什么012---Really? Why not?
我们一起寄节日贺卡012---Sending out a holiday card together?
我不知道我们之间是不是到那个地步了012---I just don't know if we're really quite there yet.
我没想到那一点  你说得对012---I didn't think of it that way. You're right. You're right.
我能问你一个问题吗  好啊012--- So can I ask you a question?  Yeah.
我们到哪个地步了012---Where are we?
我们到哪个地步了012---You know, like where are we?
我们会有什么结局012---Where is this relationship going?
我喜欢跟你待在一起012---I mean, I love spending time with you.
我只是希望我们在往前走012---I just hope we're moving forward.
我们该谈一谈  你不觉得吗012---We should talk about that, don't you think?
我们一起印卡片吧012---Let's do the card!
什么  卡片  我想我们到这个地步了012--- What?  The card! I think we're there!
好吧  但我还是觉得我们应该谈一谈012---Okay. But I still think we should have this conversation.
真的吗012---Really? I mean...
印了卡片还是要谈吗012---Even with the card?
朗医生今天没办法过来012---Just so you know, Dr. Long can't be here today,
她有事去医院了  辛夫医生会帮你检查012---she was called to the hospital, so Dr. Schiff will be seeing you.
好吧  我能问你一个问题吗012---Oh, okay. Can I ask you a question?
是我的问题  还是帮我抽血的那个家伙012---Was it me, or was the guy who took my blood sample
真的很帅012---really cute?
你知道我在说谁吗012---You know who I'm talking about?
锅盖头  手指满是毛的家伙012---Bowl haircut, hairy fingers?
瑞秋吗  我是辛夫医生  是啊012--- Hi, Rachel? I'm Dr. Schiff.  Yes, you are.
情况如何012---So, how's it going?
真的很不错  但别谈我了012---It's going really good. But enough about me! Come on.
你是哪里人  你是做哪一行的012---Where are you from? What do you do?
我是医生  对  我是指...012--- I'm a doctor.  Right. I meant...
你有空的时候  你会煮饭或滑雪吗012---...in your spare time. Do you cook? So you ski?
还是会跟太太或女朋友一起出去玩012---Or just hang out with your wife, or girlfriend?
我没有太太或女朋友  但我很喜欢滑雪012---I don't have a wife or a girlfriend, but I do like to ski.
我也喜欢滑雪  我们简直太有缘了012---I love to ski! How amazing is this?
你最近有任何不适症状吗012---Are you experiencing any discomfort?
不  我非常舒服012---No, I'm very comfortable.
放屁会不舒服吗  不会012--- Any painful gas?  No!
辛夫医生  那是哪门子的问题012---No! Shoot, Dr. Schiff! What kind of question is that?
好吧  能麻烦你躺下来吗012---Okay, then. Would you like to lie down on the table?
你想让我躺下来吗012---Would you like me to lie down on the table?
抱歉  我们之间是不是有什么情况012---I'm sorry. Is there something going on here?
你也感觉到了吗012---Do you feel it too?
门诊看得如何012---So, how did your doctor's appointment go?
让我想一想012---Well, let's see,
今天他们派了一个"帅哥"医生给我012---they gave me "cute boy" doctor today.
检查到一半  我把小指放到他的下巴酒窝里了012---In the middle of the exam, I put my pinkie in his chin dimple.
天啊  你为什么要那么做012--- Oh, my God!  Why did you do that?
还记得我怀孕四个月时012---Remember that little problem
遇到的那个小问题吗012---I was having during my fourth month of pregnancy?
对  艾凡德·霍利菲尔德的人形立牌012---Oh, yeah! The Evander Holyfield phase.
天啊  你当时病急乱投医  甚至朝我扑过来012---Oh, man! You were so hard up, you practically came on to me.
少做梦了012---You wish.
如果我真的想要你  完全可以钓到你012---Hey, I could have had you if I wanted you.
是吗  来试试看吧012---Oh, yeah? Come and get it.
好了  连这段对话都能挑起我的欲望012---Okay, even this is turning me on...
罗斯012---Hey, Ross!
你跟蒙娜还好吧012---How's it going with you and Mona?
你们还在一起吗012---Are you guys still together?
对  我们有所进展  你们会收到我们的卡片012---Yeah, we're moving forward. You'll be getting our card.
你们要一起寄节日贺卡吗012---You're doing a holiday card together?
我们不只要寄节日贺卡012---We're not just doing a card.
她还要谈一谈012---She also wants to have the conversation...
我们会有什么结局012---...about where the relationship is going.
女人啊012---Women!
就是嘛  为什么你们想要谈这种问题012---I know! Why do you guys need to have this conversation?
懂得自我尊重的男人不会问女人012---No selfrespecting man would ask a woman,
"我们会有什么结局"012---"So where is this going?"
罗斯  你问过我012---Ross, you asked me that.
你像是本合上的书  好吗012---You were a closed book, okay?
我又不会读心术012---I'm not a mind reader!
而且我讨厌谈那种话题012---Besides, I hate those conversations.
我真的不大会应付那种对话012---I'm horrible at them. Really.
或许我需要暗示她012---Maybe I need some kind of a gesture...
我们的确有进展012---...something that says we're moving forward
而不必去谈这件事012---without having to talk about it.
像是请她搬去跟你一起住012---Like asking her to move in with you?
这有点过了012---Smaller than that.
帮她录集锦录音带  又欠点火候012--- Making her a mix tape?  Bigger than that.
给她你家的钥匙012---Give her a key to your apartment.
我们的感情还是更接近送录音带的程度012---Hello. We were closer with the mix tape.
你说过"我爱你"吗  你可以说"我爱你"012---Have you said, "I love you"? You could say, "I love you."
我觉得我还没有到那个地步012---I don't think I'm quite there yet.
但我可以说"我喜欢跟你在一起"012---But I could say, "I love spending time with you."
我们讨厌那句话012---We hate that.
简直就像是被人闪了一巴掌012---That is a slap in the face.
算了  我还是去跟她谈吧012---Forget it. You know what? I'll just have the conversation.
我会说我喜欢我们现在的样子012---I'll just say I like things the way they are,
并怀着最好的期待012---and hope for the best.
你觉得呢  瑞秋012---What do you think, Rach?
我想如果这里再冷一点012---I think if it was a little colder in here...
我可以看到你乳头凸显012---...I could see your nipples through that sweater.
宾  我们今晚八点出发012---Bing? We're all set for tonight, 8:00.
我们去不成了  莫妮卡得上班012---As it turns out, we can't do it. Monica has to work.
我前妻不上班012---My exwife didn't work.
除非你说回娘家是"上班"012---Unless you call turning into her mother "work."
好吧  那就明天晚上吧012---Fine. Tomorrow night then.
她明晚也不能来  为什么012--- Tomorrow's no good for her, either.  Why not?
草地保龄球巡回赛012---It's the semifinals...
要打半决赛012---...of her bocce ball tournament.
发生了什么事  宾012---What's going on, Bing?
你老婆不喜欢我吗012---Does your wife have a problem with me or something?
你这话说得太离谱了012---Well, now you're just talking crazy.
那我们三个为什么不能一起出去玩012---Then why can't the three of us go out together?
因为我们分居了012---Because we split up.
莫妮卡跟我分居了012---Monica and I split up.
抱着我012---Hold me.
天啊  宾  我倒也不觉得诧异012---Good God, Bing. Well, I can't say I'm altogether surprised.
我看到她看你的眼神  就知道她不爱你012---I saw the way she looked at you, and there was no love there.
而她看着我时却充满了爱欲012---And the way she looked at me, pure lust.
在这种时候  只有掐人脖子012---What would really help me through this tough time
才能让我泄愤  我能掐你吗012---is choking someone. Can I choke you?
宾  孩子  我得让你放下这件事012---Bing, my boy, we're gonna get you over this.
我有个计划012---Here's the plan:
拿着你的外套  我们去脱衣舞俱乐部012---Grab your coat, we're going to a strip club!
不  莫妮卡会生气的012---Oh, no! Monica would freak.
但谁管那个臭女人呢012---But to hell with that bitch!
咖啡来了012---Here we go.
蒙娜  我们该谈谈012---Mona, it's time we had a conversation
我们之间的关系了012---about where things are with us.
是啊  那还是我先提出来的012---Yeah, I think I suggested that.
我们简直...012---We are so...
我真的很喜欢你012---Well, I really like you.
我喜欢跟你在一起012---And I love hanging out with you.
和你相处  我非常开心012---And I'm having a lot of fun.
好吧012---Okay.
如果只是为了好玩  我们就不必交往了012---There's no point in spending time with someone if it's just fun.
我们得有结果  对吧012---It's gotta be going somewhere, right?
我们会有什么结果012---So where is it going?
这才是实质性的问题012---That's the real question.
答案是...012---And the answer is...
我们会相处得...012---...it's going somewhere...
很开心012---...fun.
我知道你在想什么012---I know what you're thinking.
如果是十年前  还可以找找乐子012---Fun was fine for you 10 years ago.
但现在你也不年轻了012---But you're not getting any younger.
我不是说你  不是你012---No! I mean, not you. Not you.
你越来越年轻了012---You are getting younger!
你每一秒都在变年轻012---You're getting younger by the second.
你有什么秘诀012---What's your secret?
抱歉  我们发展到哪一步了012---I'm sorry, so where are we?
总而言之...012---Well, to sum up...
我们相处得很开心012---...we're having fun.
你看起来很年轻012---You look young.
好吧...  但这还远远不够012--- Okay...  But that's not enough.
所以...012---So...
这是我家的钥匙012---...here's a key to my apartment.
真的吗  真的012--- Really?  Really.
你不觉得发展得太快了吗012---You don't think this is too fast?
你给了她你家的钥匙012---You gave her a key to your apartment?
不仅是那样  我把唯一的钥匙给了她012---Not just a key. I gave her the only key!
我现在是个陷入认真感情  无家可归的家伙012---I am now a homeless person in a very serious relationship!
罗斯  你们谈得如何012---Ross, how did the conversation go?
很棒  我现在流落街头了012---Great. I live on the street.
哪里012---Where?
好吧  莫妮卡  瑞秋...012---Okay, Monica, Rachel...
他是我朋友罗杰  嗨  罗杰012---...this is my friend Roger.  Hi, Roger.
罗杰012---Hi, Roger.
我去拿饮料  你能过来帮我吗012---I'll get us some drinks. Could you help me out?
好吧012---Yeah, okay.
他是来跟你做爱的012---He's here to have sex with you.
什么  别客气012--- What?  You're welcome.
菲比  不  没关系  他是个处男012--- Phoebe, no!  It's okay. He's a virgin.
瑞秋  我跟这个家伙聊天012---Rachel, I was talking to this guy.
我觉得他要跟你做爱012---I think he'll have sex with you.
让他们两个独处一下吧012---Let's leave these two alone.
不要  不管我的荷尔蒙怎么作祟012---No! I don't care what my hormones are doing!
我不会随便跟男人上床012---I won't do it with some random guy!
好吧  那么你去告诉罗杰012---Fine! Then you tell Roger,
因为他真的很期待这场艳遇012---because he was really looking forward to this!
宾  快看那对双胞胎姐妹一起跳舞012---Bing! Look at those twin sisters dancing together.
我出钱请她们在你大腿上跳艳舞吧012---Let me buy you a lap dance with those girls.
不用了  而且只有一个女孩在跳舞012---That's all right, sir. And that's just one girl.
宾  这是什么  那是我的手012--- Bing, what's this?  It's a hand.
用来帮你端酒的工具012---It's a thing you use as a Jack and Coke holder.
不  是婚戒  你得把它丢掉012---No. It's a wedding ring. You gotta get rid of it.
我们现在就到东河把它扔下去012---We're gonna go to the East River right now and throw it in there!
不要  要012--- No!  Yes!
我就那么做了  感觉好很多012---I did it, and I felt a lot better!
如果你仍得有准头  甚至可能会打中海鸥012---And if you whip it just right you might hit a seagull in the head.
好吧  我需要一堆备用钥匙012---Okay. I'm gonna need a bunch of extra keys.
很明显  我会毫无理由地把钥匙送人012---Apparently, I give them away for no reason at all.
罗斯  发生了什么事  你在换锁012---Ross, what's going on? You're changing the lock?
不是012---No.
是那个家伙在换锁012---That guy is.
我这就不懂了  你刚把你家的钥匙给我012---I don't understand. You give me a key to your apartment,
然后你就把锁换了012---and then you change the lock?
祝你好运  哥们012---Good luck, buddy.
我以为我们往前迈进了一步012---I thought we were moving forward.
而现在你却向我发送各种混乱讯息012---Now you're sending me all these mixed signals.
你到底想告诉我什么012---What are you trying to tell me?
我想告诉你...012---I'm trying to tell you...
我帮你录了一卷集锦录音带012---...I made you a mix tape.
什么  我爱你012--- What?  I love you.
我喜欢跟你在一起012---And I love spending time with you.
老婆  我回来了012---Hi, honey, I'm home.
从龙舌兰酒工厂回来的012---From the tequila factory?
感觉糟透了012---It was awful.
为了逃避跟道格的晚餐约会012---To get out of going to dinner with Doug,
我告诉他你跟我分居了012---I told him you and I split up.
他拖我去脱衣舞俱乐部  还有色情酒吧012---So then he took me to these strip clubs and sleazy bars.
我不肯把婚戒交给他012---When I wouldn't give him my wedding ring,
他就用汽水罐打小鸟012---he threw a soda can at a bird.
过来  我可以用嘴巴呼吸012---Come here. I can breathe through my mouth.
亲爱的  你知道最糟糕的是什么吗012--- Oh, sweetie. You know what the worst part was?
我预见到了没有你的生活是什么样子012---I got to see what my life would be like without you.
就像是《生活多美好》配上艳舞012---It was like It's a Wonderful Life with lap dances.
请答应我  你永远不会离开我012---Please promise me that you'll never leave me...
我们会一起变老012---...that we'll grow old together,
相伴一生012---and be with each other for the rest of our lives.
我答应你012---I promise.
说到相伴一生012---Speaking of together,
我们今年一起寄节日贺卡吧012---how about we send out a holiday card this year?
我不知道我们是不是到那个地步了012---I don't know if we're there yet.
我想订披萨  我能问你一个问题吗012---I'd like to order a pizza. Can I ask you a question?
今晚是那个金发帅哥外送吗012---Is the cute blond guy delivering tonight?
长得又酷又时髦的那个012---Very "Abercrombie & Fitch."
我再打给你  你在跟谁打电话012--- I'll call you back.  Who was that?
我在订披萨012---It's just the pizza place.
你竟然挂掉了订披萨的电话012---You hung up on the pizza place?
我可不会挂掉你朋友的电话012---I don't hang up on your friends.
抱歉  今天我过得不顺心012---Sorry, honey, I'm just having a rough day.
怎么了012---What's wrong?
你不会想听的012---You don't want to hear about it.
不然我为什么要问012---Then why did I ask?
这真的很丢脸012---Okay, this is really embarrassing,
但最近自从我怀孕后012---but lately, with this whole pregnancy thing...
我发现自己...012---...I'm just finding myself...
我该怎么说呢012---How do I put this?
春情大发012---Erotically charged.
那是"性饥渴"的学名吗012---Is that college talk for "horny"?
对  我心中充满了欲望012---Yeah. I have all of these feelings,
但却不知道该怎么处理012---and I don't know what to do about them.
我没办法像正常人去约会012---I can't date like a normal person,
这没关系  因为我不需要男朋友012---which is fine because I don't need a relationship.
我只想要一夜情  只有性爱就好012---All I really want is one great night! Just sex.
没有牵绊  不谈恋爱012---No strings attached. No relationship.
就跟我喜欢的人在一起012---With someone I feel comfortable with,
他懂得掌握分寸012---and who knows what he's doing.
只要共度一夜春宵012---For just one great night.
真的就那么难...012---I mean, is that really so hard...
找到吗012---...to find?
你今天过得如何012---So how was your day?
很好  我看见一只超大的鸽子012---Good. I saw a pretty big pigeon.
我还得早起  都快七点了012---Well, I gotta get up early, and it's almost 7:00.
我得回房了  晚安012--- I gotta go to my room.  Good night!
晚安012---Good night!
我不能那么做  我没有要你那么做012--- I can't do it!  I didn't ask you to do it!
你是瑞秋  你是乔伊012--- You're Rachel!  You're Joey!
你是我的朋友  你也是我的朋友012--- You're my friend!  Right back at you.
对  而且那样是不对的  怪异又恶劣012---Yeah. Plus, it would be wrong, and weird and bad!
太恶劣了  但我不知道你在说什么012---So bad! But I don't know what you're talking about.
因为我没要求你做什么事  我知道012--- Because I didn't ask you to do anything!  I know!
你想做吗  不想012--- You wanna do it?  No!
我也不想  我只是在考验你012---Me neither. I'm just testing you!
那这件事就到此为止了012---Well, that's the end of this conversation!
就当什么都没发生过  没错012--- This conversation never happened!  Never happened!
晚安  晚安012--- Good night!  Good night!
快回你房里012---Get back in there!
听着  关于罗杰的事  我很抱歉012---Listen, I'm sorry about that whole thing with Roger.
那么做很不合适  我想弥补你012---It really wasn't right. And I want to make it up to you.
我带了一样我觉得你会喜欢的东西来012---So I brought you something I think you'll really enjoy.
我只是借给你用  好吗012---Now this is just a loan, okay?
我还会把它拿回去012---I'm gonna want him back.
我得走了012---I'm gonna go now.
抱歉  我以为我办得到  但却不行012---I'm sorry. I thought I could do it, and I can't.
