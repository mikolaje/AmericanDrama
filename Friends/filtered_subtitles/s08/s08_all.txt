太棒了012---Great.
让我换一下底片  好012---Great. Just give me a sec to change film. Okay.
我知道你不希望我知道012---Okay. I know I'm not supposed to know,
但我知道了  我真为你感到高兴012---but I do and I'm so excited for you.
什么回事012---What's going on?
莫妮卡怀孕了012---Monica's pregnant.
天啊  所以说你们两个是奉子成婚012---Oh, my God. Is that why you guys had to get married?
我没有怀孕012---Guys, I'm not pregnant.
精子游得太慢了012---Oh, slow swimmers?
什么  你这是什么意思  你没有怀孕吗012---What?! What do you mean? You're not pregnant?
你没跑去跟别人说我怀孕了吧012---You didn't tell anybody I was, did you?
没有012---No.
我马上回来012---I'll be right back.
我们来拍张莫妮卡跟英勇士兵的合照012---Why don't we get a shot of Monica and the bloody soldier.
说起这点  乔伊你得在婚宴开始前换套衣服012---About that, Joey, you have to change before the party.
不行  我没带衣服来换012---I can't. I don't have any other clothes here.
那就拜托去找套衣服012---Find some, please.
别再穿着"我不幸战死于法国"的衣服了012---Anything that doesn't say, "I died tragically in France."
我们让新人跟伴娘们合照一些照片吧012---Why don't we see the bride and the groom, and the bridesmaids.
莫妮卡  你为什么告诉大家你没有怀孕012---Hey, Mon, why'd you tell the guys that you weren't pregnant?
因为我本来就没怀012---Because I'm not.
我们发现了你的验孕棒  如果你没有怀孕...012---We found your tests. If you're not pregnant...
那是因为我怀孕了012---...it's because I am.
你在胡说什么  菲比  你在胡说什么012---What are you talking about? Phoebe, what are you talking about?
对  我怀了孩子012---Yes, I am with child.
我不想说  因为今天是你们的大喜之日012---I didn't want to say anything because it's your day.
我不想抢了你的风采012---I didn't wanna steal your thunder.
于是你就告诉大家我怀孕了012---So you told people I was pregnant?
你觉得这种对话  我会想要记录下来吗012---Does this look like a conversation I want to remember?
孩子他爸是谁  对啊012---Who's the father? Yeah.
我不能说012---I can't say.
为什么   为什么不行012---Why? Why not?
我不能说  因为他是名人012---I can't say because he's famous.
天啊  是哪个名人012---Oh, my God. Who is it?
菲比  你得告诉我们012---Phoebe, come on, you have to tell us.
好吧  是詹姆斯.布洛林012---Okay, okay, it's James Brolin.
詹姆斯.布洛林是孩子的爸爸012---James Brolin is the father of my baby.
你指的是芭芭拉·史翠珊的老公詹姆斯·布洛林012---As in Barbra Streisand's husband James Brolin?
什么012---What?!
他从没跟我提过这事012---Well, he never said that to me.
《老友记》  第八季  第1集  在说了"我愿意"之后012---Friends S08E01 The One After I Do
莫妮卡  请你先到旁边012---Monica, if you step away,
我们要拍钱德勒跟伴娘的合照  好012---we'll get Chandler and the bridesmaids. Okay.
何不只拍伴娘的合照呢012---How about just the bridesmaids?
我是新郎  听说这个角色很重要012---You know, I am the groom. I was told it was a big deal.
没错  对012---It is. Yeah.
天啊012---Oh, my God.
谢谢你  我现在还没有办法处理这件事012---Thank you for that. I just can't deal with this just quite yet.
于是你告诉我莫妮卡怀孕了012---So instead you told me Monica was pregnant?
是你说她怀孕了  我只是没反驳你罢了012---You said she was. I just didn't disagree with you.
真狡猾  是啊012---Sneaky. Yeah.
笑一个  姑娘们012---Smile, ladies!
詹姆斯.布洛林  亏你想得出  我知道012---By the way, James Brolin? I know.
我脑海里只蹦出两个人名012---I could only think of two names:
他跟小艾德·贝格利012---Him and Ed Begley Jr. And then...
我记得他是男同志  所以...012---I remembered he's gay, so...
小艾德·贝格利不是男同志012---Ed Begley Jr. is not gay.
真的吗012---Really?
非常感谢012---Thank you very much.
先生们女士们  我非常荣幸地012---Ladies and gentlemen, it gives me great pleasure to introduce to you
首次向大家介绍  钱德勒·宾夫妇012---for the very first time: Mr. And Mrs. Chandler Bing.
到舞池前  我要送你一份礼物012---Before we go out there, I got a present for you.
我才不要把手伸到你的口袋里012---Honey, I'm not gonna put my hand in your pocket.
不是  我去上了舞蹈课  什么012---No. I've been taking dancing lessons. What?
我上了六星期的舞蹈课012---For the last six weeks.
我希望这一刻能让你永生难忘012---I wanted this to be a moment you'd never forget.
真的是太体贴了012---That is so sweet.
你愿不愿意以夫妻的身份跟我跳第一支舞012---So would you care to join me in our first dance as husband and wife?
我愿意012---Yes.
怎么了012---What's the matter?
我的新鞋太滑了012---It's these new shoes, they're all slippery.
你还能跳舞吗  不太行012---Are you gonna be able to do this? Not well.
好消息是我觉得没人在看我们012---Well, the good news is, I don't think anyone's looking at us.
你准备好要谈谈了吗012---So are you ready to talk about it?
没有012---No.
现在呢012---Now?
我不要谈012---No!
我们来谈别的事  谢谢012---We'll talk about something else then. Thank you.
孩子他爸是谁012---Who's the father?
亲爱的  我还没有告诉他012---Honey, I haven't told him yet...
我打算先告诉他  再告诉其他人012---...so, until I do, I don't think I should tell anybody else.
没关系  那很合理012---Yeah. That's fine. That's fair.
是泰格吗  菲比012---Is it Tag? Phoebe!
好吧  对不起  我不问了012---Okay, I'm sorry. I'll stop.
是罗斯吗  是罗斯吧012---Is it Ross? It's Ross, isn't it?
天啊  是乔伊  别说了  好吗012---Oh, my God, it's Joey! Stop it. Okay?
在告诉他之前我不会告诉你的012---I am not gonna tell you until I tell him.
至少我们知道他是个男的012---At least we know it's a him.
天啊012---Oh, sweet Lord.
对不起  好吗  我跑到礼品店012---I'm sorry, okay? I went down to the gift shop.
那里只卖这个跟浴袍012---It was either this or a bathrobe.
你更看重哪点呢  是我的穿着打扮012---Look. What's more important: the way I'm dressed,
还是我能出席你的婚礼012---or being with you on your special day?
我都懒得假装刚才在听你说话012---Honey, I'm not gonna even pretend I was listening. Hey! Hey!
我是罗斯  我们应该没有见过012---I'm Ross, I don't believe we met.
我是莫妮卡的哥哥012---I'm Monica's older brother.
我是她在餐厅的同事蒙娜012---Hi, I'm Mona from her restaurant.
你好  她在餐厅的同事蒙娜012---Hello, Mona from her restaurant.
蒙娜  这个名字很美012---Mona. What a beautiful name.
是吗  我一直都很讨厌这个名字012---You think so? I always kind of hated it.
少来了  蒙娜丽莎012---Come on! Mona Lisa.
蒙娜...012---Mona...
利格拉齐012---...Llegglachen.
她是着名的植物学家012---The famous botanist.
不  她...她死了  但是012---Oh, no, she's... Well, she's dead now, but...
她曾经是植物学界最性感的女人012---Supposedly she was once quite the hottie of the plant world.
真的吗012---Really?
我根本不认识她  琳达·利格拉齐012---See, I never knew about her. Linda Llegglachen...
你在几号桌012---So, what table are you at?
我也是012---Me too.
很好  那就有个喜欢我名字的人跟我同桌了012---Good. Now there'll be someone there who likes my name.
对  没错012---Yes, there will.
猜怎么着  莫莉·吉柏特012---Guess what, Molly Gilbert.
你刚刚被踢到一号桌了012---You've just been bumped up to table one.
如果你没有意见的话012---And if it's all right with you,
我要代替你坐到六号桌012---I'll take your place at table six.
马丁·利格拉齐012---Martin Llegglachen.
这样好多了  现在双手弯曲012---That's better. Now, just bend your arms a little bit.
眼睛看前方012---Now look straight ahead.
这次我要你臀部用力顶012---Okay, this time I want you to really put your ass into it.
钱德勒  你看我的男伴终于来了012---Chandler, darling, look, my date has finally arrived.
这位是丹尼斯·菲利浦斯012---I'd like you to meet Dennis Phillips.
恭喜  谢谢012---Congratulations. Thank you.
丹尼斯是我的老朋友...012---Yes, Dennis is a dear old friend...
还是个绝佳情人012---...and a fantastic lover.
太棒了  丹尼斯  谢谢你取悦我老妈012---Bravo, Dennis. Thanks for pleasing my mother so.
抱歉我没赶上婚礼  我在忙着试镜012---I'm so sorry I missed the ceremony. I was stuck at auditions.
对  丹尼斯正在执导一出百老汇新戏012---Yes, Dennis is directing a new Broadway show.
我们应该还没见过  乔伊·崔比安尼012---I don't believe we've met. Joey Tribbiani.
丹尼斯·菲利浦斯012---Dennis Phillips.
多年来我一直很欣赏你的作品012---I've admired your work for years.
你的作品真的很棒  谢谢012---You've done some really amazing stuff. Thank you.
失陪一下  我要去喝点东西012---If you'll excuse me, I'm gonna go get myself a drink.
我马上回来012---I'll be back in a moment.
丹尼斯·菲利浦斯  真是太棒了012---Dennis Phillips. That's great.
你们怎么认识的012---How did you guys meet?
那个故事说起来有趣012---Well, it's a funny story.
是惹人发笑  还是惨不忍睹012---Funny, "haha"? Or funny:
谢谢  非常感谢012---Thank you. Thank you very much.
大家请坐012---If everyone will please take your seats,
晚宴马上开始012---dinner will be served.
我以为你在六号桌  不  是九号桌012---I thought you were at table six. No. Nine.
你刚刚给我看时是那样拿的...012---See, before, when you showed it to me, you held it that way...
我被你误导了012---...which was misleading.
你们好012---Hello.
你能请你妈把我的履历表012---Will you see if your mom
拿给丹尼斯·菲利浦斯吗012---can give my resume to Dennis Phillips?
只要能演百老汇舞台剧  我就什么戏都演过了012---If I could get in a Broadway show, then I would've done it all.
电影  电视剧跟舞台剧012---Film, television and theater.
唯一的例外是广播剧012---The only thing left would be radio.
那是留给丑八怪演的012---But that's just for ugly people.
你穿几号鞋  11号  11号半012---What size shoes do you wear? 11, 11 half.
我的鞋子太滑没办法跳舞012---Great. My shoes give me a problem on the dance floor.
你的戏靴能借我吗012---Can I borrow your boots from your costume?
我真不知道把靴子丢到哪里去了  抱歉012---I don't really even know where I left those. Sorry.
你的脚不可能是11号半012---Those aren't 11 half.
好吧  我穿七号的鞋子012---Okay, fine, I'm a 7!
我的脚出奇的小012---I have surprisingly small feet.
但其它部份都很大  我可以露给你看012---But the rest of me is good. I'll show you.
你能相信菲比怀孕了吗012---Can you believe Phoebe got pregnant?
现在别谈那件事了012---You know what, honey? Let's not talk about that right now.
这可是爆炸性新闻012---This is so huge.
没错  但那也没有你的婚礼重要012---Sure, but as big as your wedding?
当然  我的婚礼最重要了012---Of course not. Nothing is.
说句悄悄话  到了这个时代...012---Between me and you, in this day and age...
谁会笨到让自己怀孕012---...how dumb do you have to be to get pregnant?
有时候你该做的都做了012---You know? Sometimes you can do everything right.
双方都戴上了该戴的东西012---Everyone wears what they're supposed to wear...
但有个小家伙还是攻过了城池012---...and one of those little guys just gets through.
怎么会呢012---How?
我不知道  或许它们有什么工具012---I don't know. Maybe they have tools.
我跟她谈过  她要把孩子生下来012---Well, I talked to her, and she's definitely gonna have the baby.
她说她要自己抚养孩子012---She said she's gonna raise it on her own.
或许那真的很勇敢012---Well, maybe that's really brave.
或许吧  我只是希望她知道那有多辛苦012---Maybe. I just hope she realizes how hard it's gonna be.
或许她没有想那么多012---Maybe she hasn't really thought it through that much.
的确有很多事需要考虑012---Well, there's a lot to think about.
她要怎么解决经济问题012---How is she gonna handle this financially?
她怎么能应付得了工作012---How is she gonna juggle work?
她知道她在未来的18年内012---Does she realize she's not gonna have a date again
都没法再去约会了吗012---for the next, like, 18 years?
我不知道012---I don't know.
你没事吧012---Are you okay?
我只是想到菲比怀了孕  可怜的菲比012---I'm just thinking about Phoebe. Poor, knockedup Phoebe.
要喝香槟吗012---Champagne?
好的  谢谢你012---Oh, yes! Thank you very much.
法国人都是那样喝香槟的012---That's actually how the French drink it.
我刚刚跟我的情人詹姆斯·布洛林通过电话012---Well, I just got off the phone with my lover James Brolin.
真的吗012---Oh, really?
他显然娶了一个歌手012---Yes. Apparently, he is married to some singer.
但他说他会为了我离开她012---But he said he'd leave her for me.
我说"詹姆斯·布洛林  你确定吗"012---And I said, "James, James Brolin, are you sure?"
詹姆斯·布洛林说...012---James Brolin said...
怀孕的人是瑞秋012---Rachel's really the one who's pregnant?
什么012---What?!
装得那么费劲干嘛012---Why bother?
你感觉如何  我不知道我有什么感觉012---How do you feel? I don't know. I don't know how I feel.
一切都发生得太快了012---This is all happening so fast.
我得做出许多我不想做的决定012---I have to make all these decisions that I don't wanna make.
谁快把这玩意拿走012---Someone just take this away from me!
冷静点  或许你没有怀孕  什么012---Calm down. Maybe you're not pregnant. What?!
我怀三胞胎的时候012---When I got pregnant with the triplets,
也验了三次孕才确定012---I took that test, like, three times just to make sure.
对  或许是假警报012---Yes. Maybe it's a false positive.
你确定你在验孕棒上尿的方式没错吗012---Are you sure you peed on the stick right?
不然我要怎么尿才对012---How many ways are there to do that?
我是说在没有百分之百确定前别大惊小怪012---I'm just saying, don't freak out until you're 100 percent sure.
好吧  我回家后会再验一次012---All right, I'll take it again when I get home.
你可以现在验012---You gotta take it now.
就当成送我的礼物吧012---Do it as a present to me.
好吧  谢谢你  好的012---Okay, thank you. Okay.
我去帮你买验孕棒012---I'll run out and get you one.
你们真是太好了012---You girls are so great.
等一下  孩子他爸是谁012---Wait a minute. Who's the father?
她不肯告诉我们012---She won't tell us.
快说吧  这可是我的婚礼012---Come on! It's my wedding.
你可以把这当做是送我的礼物012---That could be my present!
我刚刚答应为了你验孕012---I just gave you peeing on a stick.
看吧  所以一定要做礼物登记012---See, this is why you register.
又是椅子的声音  好吗  我没放012---It was the chair again. Okay? I'm not doing it!
这样吧012---It was... Look, you know what?
你想跳舞吗  好啊012---Would you like to dance? Sure.
太棒了012---Great.
盖勒博士  我没有放屁012---Dr. Geller. I wasn't farting!
那是我们那一桌玩的小游戏012---A little game from our table.
什么事  盖勒博士  你愿意跟我跳舞吗012---Yes? Dr. Geller, will you dance with me?
或许待会再说  现在我要跟这位小姐跳舞012---Maybe later. Right now, I'm about to dance with this lady.
好吧012---Okay.
除非这位小姐不介意让你插队012---Unless this lady wouldn't mind letting you go first.
我很乐意  你太好心了012---I'd be happy to. You are very sweet.
没错  我确实好心012---Yes, I am.
我们来试试我的绝招012---In fact, why don't we try my special way?
你可以踩在我的脚上跳舞012---You can dance on my feet.
没问题  是吗  跳上来吧012---Sure. Yeah? Hop on.
那个美丽的小姐在看吗  在012---Is the pretty lady looking? Uhhuh.
继续跳012---Keep dancing.
世上无人将欣赏到这般舞姿012---And the world will never know.
你跟丹尼斯提过我的事了吗012---Did you talk to Dennis about me yet?
我跟他提到你非常有天份012---Yes. I told him how talented you were
还有《我们的日子》的事012---and I told him all about Days of our Lives.
不不不  你不能把那种事告诉百老汇导演012---No, no, no! You don't tell a Broadway guy that!
现在他会以为我只是个肥皂剧演员012---Now he thinks I'm just a soap actor.
但你不只是肥皂剧演员012---But you're not just a soap actor.
你是长了双小脚的肥皂剧演员012---You are a soap actor with freakishly tiny feet.
谢谢  不  谢谢你  米兰达012---Thank you. No, thank you, Miranda.
是梅玲达  好吧012---Melinda. All right.
那简直太可爱了012---How cute was that?
你在看我们吗012---Oh, were you watching?
下一个能跟我跳吗012---Can I go next?
当然可以  来吧012---Of course you can. Hop on.
好吧  但我要排在她后面012---Okay, but I get to hop on after her.
我一定能"得分" 什么012---I am so gonna score. What?
我喜欢你的蝴蝶结012---I like your bow.
我要请大家举杯向莫妮卡及钱德勒致意012---I'd like to propose a toast to Monica and Chandler...
他们是全世界最般配的夫妻012---...the greatest couple in the world,
也是我最好的朋友012---and my best friends.
我刚听说他们要结婚时012---When I first found out they were getting married,
我有点生气012---I was... I was a little angry.
我心想"天啊  为什么012---I was like, "Why, God? Why?
你为什么要把他们从我身边抢走"012---How can you take them away from me!"
然后我回想起我们之间有过的回忆012---But then I thought back over all our memories together.
快乐的回亿012---Some happy memories.
还有悲伤的回亿012---And there were some sad memories.
对不起012---I'm sorry.
还有可怕的回亿012---And some scared memories.
然后我才发现  我永远都会是他们的朋友012---And then I realized I'll always be their friend.
他们这个朋友会说好几种方言012---Their friend who can speak in many dialects...
接受过舞台训练012---...and has training in stage combat
愿意拍部份裸露的戏份012---and is willing to do partial nudity.
敬这对金童玉女012---To the happy couple.
谢谢  刚才跳得很棒  艾许莉012---Thank you. That was very nice, Ashley.
我们能再跳一次吗   不行012---Can we do it again? No, no.
现在轮到我了吗  我是下一个012---So, is it my turn now? I'm next.
没关系  你可以先跟她跳012---That's okay, you can dance with her first.
你确定吗012---Are you sure?
好吧012---Okay.
你叫什么名字  葛特012---Okay, so, what's your name? Gert.
名字真美012---That's pretty.
你想要做什么  葛特012---What are you doing there, Gert?
跟其他女孩一样踩在你脚上跳舞012---Dancing on your feet like the other girls did it.
好吧012---Okay.
跳上来吧  葛特012---Hop on, Gert.
你的脚为什么不动012---Why aren't you moving your feet?
我在努力了012---I'm trying.
快一点  你跳得太慢了012---Faster. You're not going fast enough.
或许我该踩在你脚上012---Maybe I should stand on your feet!
你听到我的致词了吗012---So did you happen to catch my toast up there?
天啊  你那么做是为了我012---Oh, my God. That was for my benefit?
我那么做是为了所有人012---There was a little something for everyone.
我知道你在为新戏选角012---I know you're casting for this new show.
我觉得你不适合这部戏012---Look, Joey. I don't think you're right for this project.
你这就错了吧012---See, that's where you're wrong.
不论是什么戏  我都能演012---Whatever it is, I can do it.
如果你对刚刚的表演不满意  考考我012---If you didn't see it up there, just try me.
那出戏的演员全是中国人012---It's an all Chinese cast.
你可以变成中国人吗012---Can you be Chinese?
我不以此为荣  但是...012---Well, I'm not proud of this, but...
天啊  求求你别那么做012---Oh, my God. No, no, no. Please don't!
准备重回舞池了吗012---Ready to get back to the dance floor?
它变成沙地了吗012---Did it turn into sand?
我喜欢这首歌  你会跳得很好的012---Come on, I love this song. Come on. You'll be fine.
不  我跳不好012---No. No, I won't.
你知道为什么我要去上舞蹈课吗012---Do you know why I took all those lessons?
我不希望让别人看到012---For the first time, I didn't want you to be embarrassed
你跟一个跳梁小丑跳舞  丢光了脸012---to be seen on the dance floor with some clumsy idiot.
老公  你绝不会让我出丑012---Oh, sweetie, you could never embarrass me.
好吧  你很容易就会让我出丑012---Okay, you could easily embarrass me.
但那不重要  好吗012---But it doesn't matter, all right?
我嫁给你了012---I married you.
我要在新婚之夜跟我丈夫跳舞  来吧012---So I'm gonna dance on my wedding night with my husband. Come on.
尽量不要移动你的脚012---Just try not to move your feet at all.
这就对了012---There you go.
钱德勒  我要叫警察逮捕你  为什么012---Chandler, I'm gonna have you arrested. Why?
你偷了我的舞步012---You stole my moves!
还要多久  30秒012---How much longer? 30 seconds.
30秒  好吧012---Thirty seconds, okay...
我错过了吗012---Did I miss it?
瑞秋012---Rachel.
你要知道  如果是阳性反应  我们会...012---I want you to know that if it's positive, we're gonna...
我知道  你知道  好吧012---I know. I know. You do. Okay.
时候到了012---It's time.
别进来012---No!
来吧  瑞秋012---Go ahead, Rach.
等一下  我不敢看012---Wait. You know what? I can't look at it. I can't look at it.
谁帮我看一下告诉我012---Somebody else tell me. Somebody else tell me.
好吧012---Okay.
是阴性反应012---It's negative.
什么  是阴性反应012---What? It's negative.
真相大白了012---Well, there you go.
太棒了  这真是个天大的好消息012---That is... That's great. That is really great, great news.
因为这整件事...012---You know, because the whole...
我在经济方面还没有准备好  所以...012---...not being ready and, kind of, the financial aspects, all that...
事情本来就应该是这样的012---This is so just the way that this was supposed to be.
那就太棒了012---Then, great.
天啊  我真是太蠢了012---God, this is so stupid.
我怎么会为了我从未拥有过的东西难过012---How can I be upset over something I never had?
是阴性反应吗012---It's negative?
不  是阳性反应012---No, it's positive.
什么  不是阴性反应  是阳性反应012---What? It's not negative, it's positive.
你确定吗  对  我刚刚说了谎012---Are you sure? Yeah, I lied before.
天啊012---My god.
现在你知道自己的真实感受了012---Now you know how you really feel about it.
那可真是个危险的小把戏012---That's a risky little game.
你真的要把孩子生下来吗012---Are you really gonna do this?
对012---Yeah.
我要把孩子生下来012---I'm gonna have a baby.
我要有孩子了012---I'm gonna have a baby.
我要有孩子了012---I'm gonna have a baby!
孩子他爸是谁  不  现在还不是时候012---With who? No, it's still not the time.
我不知道接下来是首快歌012---I just didn't see the fast song coming.
别说话  我们送你回房间让你泡泡脚012---Don't try to talk, we'll get you up to your room, soak your feet.
你会没事的012---You'll be okay.
谢谢  那真的是太好心了012---Thank you. That is so sweet!
不  我是认真的  现在好男人不多了012---No, I mean it. There are so few genuinely nice guys out there.
可不是嘛012---Tell me about it.
我简直感觉自己是在孤军奋斗012---I feel like I'm holding down the fort by myself.
你是乔伊  对吧  对012---It's Joey, right? Yeah.
等一下  不要012---Wait a minute! No!
我才是好人012---I'm the nice one!
整晚跟孩子们跳舞的人是我012---I'm the one that danced with the kids all night. I...
你的脚好小啊012---How small are your feet?!
听着  先生  我最后一次告诉你012---Listen, you know what, sir, for the last time,
我不管电脑上登记了什么012---I don't care what the computer says.
我们没从房间冰箱拿走一包糖果012---We did not take a bag of Mashuga Nuts from the minibar.
我们也没看《热心"助"人的医生》012---And we did not watch Dr. DoMeALittle.
乔伊  昨晚你到过我们房间吗  没有012--- Joey, were you in our room last night?  No.
他们说电影片名不会出现在帐单上012---I was told the name of the movie would not appear on the bill.
我们要退掉新婚套房012---We're checking out of the bridal suite.
没错  我不再是新娘了012---That's right, I'm no longer a bride.
也永远都当不了新娘012---I'll never be a bride again.
现在我不过是某人的太太012---Now I'm just someone's wife.
而我是全世界最幸福的男人012---And I'm the happiest guy in the world.
亲爱的  别难过012---Come on. Honey, don't be upset.
我们的未来充满期待  可不是嘛012--- We still have so much to look forward to.  Yeah, right.
我们还要去度蜜月012---We got the honeymoon.
那还要等到星期四012---That's not till Thursday.
还有婚纱照012---The wedding pictures.
那得等上好几个星期012---It won't be ready for weeks.
但婚宴上用"即可拍"拍的照片马上可以洗好012---Not the disposable cameras from the tables.
没错  我就知道我嫁给你是有原因的012---That's true. I knew I married you for a reason!
听着  我拿照片去洗  你先回家吧012---Tell you what, I will go get them developed, and you can go home.
好012---Okay.
怎么  你拍了什么  没什么012--- What? What did you take a picture of?  Nothing.
绝对精彩哦012---It was something.
即可拍在罗斯那里  他还没有退房吗012---Ross has the cameras. Has he checked out yet?
你开什么玩笑  退房时间是中午012---Are you joking? Checkout is not till noon.
他还有11分钟  所以呢012--- And he has a good 11 minutes left.  So?
罗斯从来不会提早退房  一分钟都不浪费012---So Ross had never checked out of a room a minute before he had to.
我们在交往的时候  有一次延后退房012---One time, when we were dating, we got a late checkout.
他异常兴奋  那是我们最性福的一次012---He got so excited, it was the best sex we ever had.
结果他最后大喊"雷迪森酒店"  真扫兴012---Until he screamed out "Radisson" at the end.
好吧  我去找罗斯拿照相机012---Okay, well, I'm gonna get Ross, get the cameras
然后把底片拿去洗012---and get them developed.
乔伊  你都32岁了  别那么幼稚行吗012---32, Joe. You're 32!
这是你的帐单  谢谢012--- Here's a copy of your bill.  Thanks.
香槟  草莓...012---Champagne, strawberries...
天啊012---Oh, my God!
我不敢相信钱德勒在我们的新婚之夜看黄片012---I can't believe Chandler ordered porn on our wedding night.
对  真可悲012---Yeah, that's sad.
来点糖果吧012---Mashuga Nut?
《老友记》  第八季  第2集  红毛线衫012---Friends S08E02 The One With The Red Sweater
肥皂  洗发水  你真的要带这些东西吗012---Soaps, shampoos. Are you really taking all this stuff?
为什么不行  这全包含在房费里012---Why not? It's built into the price of the room.
对  但你不需要...  这是什么012---Yeah, but you don't need... What is this?
针线包012---Thread.
答对了012---Score!
即可拍在哪里012---Where are the disposable cameras?
什么即可拍012---What disposable cameras?
昨晚我把它们交给你保管012---The cameras. Remember last night I asked you to take them.
才没有  怎么没有  记得吗012--- No, you didn't.  Yes, remember?
在切蛋糕前  我找到你说...012---Right before we cut the cake, I went up to you and I said...
对  你问我能不能帮你一个忙012---Yeah, you asked me if I could do you a favor.
这时墨瑞叔叔走过来交给你一张支票012---Then my Uncle Murray came up to you and handed you a check.
然后你问"它为什么叫做支票012---Then you said, "Why is it called a check?
为什么不叫南斯拉夫人"012---Why not a Yugoslavian?"
对  然后你笑得魂不附体012---Yeah, then you did that,
即可拍不在你手上  没错  抱歉012--- So you don't have the cameras?  No, sorry, man.
那怎么办  相机不见了  莫妮卡会气疯的012---So, what? They're gone? Monica's gonna freak!
它们应该就在酒店里某个地方012---I'm sure they're somewhere here in the hotel.
我帮你找012---I'll help you look for that.
太棒了  再等三分钟012--- Great.  In three minutes.
你要丢下钱德勒  自己拆礼物吗012---Are you gonna open the presents without Chandler?
不  我只是012---No! I'm just...
它们在呼换我012---They're calling out to me.
这个小家伙甚至都爬到我大腿上了012---This little guy even crawled up in my lap.
我就拆一样礼物  钱德勒不会介意的012---Chandler wouldn't mind if I opened just one present.
你觉得这是什么012---What do you think it is?
是一面小镜子 只要你一照...012---A little mirror that, when you look into it...
就会发现自己变成了老太婆012---...you see yourself as an old woman.
是个迷你盐罐012---A tiny salt shaker!
天啊  是用来装迷你盐的012---Oh, my God, for tiny salt!
好吧  拆礼物真好玩  是啊012--- Oh, wow! Okay. Well, that was fun.  Oh, yeah.
我会等钱德勒回来012---Okay, I'll just wait for Chandler
一起拆其他礼物  好012--- to open up the rest of them.  Okay.
但这只是调味瓶组的一部分012---Although, you know, this is part of a saltandpepper set.
它只能算半份礼物  你觉得呢012---It may just count as only half a present. What do you think?
如果这是一套的012---I guess it's okay to open one more
再拆开一样应该没关系  就这个吧012---if it's part of a set. It's probably this one.
或是这个012---Or this one!
你感觉怎样  晨吐了吗012---How are you feeling? Got any morning sickness?
男生们还不知道吧012---The guys don't know yet, do they?
乔伊跟罗斯什么都不知道012---No, Joey and Ross don't know anything.
钱德勒还以为是菲比怀孕了012---And Chandler still thinks Phoebe's pregnant.
没错  钱德勒还以为是我怀孕了012---That's right. Chandler does still think I'm pregnant.
他没问我感觉如何 也没帮我提袋子012---He hasn't asked me how I'm feeling or offered to carry my bags.
我真替跟他在一起的女人觉得难过012---I feel bad for the woman who ends up with him.
我是指在你之后的女人012---After you, of course.
别担心  你只需要再假装怀孕几小时012---Don't worry. I promise you only have to be pregnant for a few more hours
因为今天我要告诉孩子他爸了012---...because I'm telling the father today.
他就住在这栋公寓吗012---Is it someone in the building?
是一楼那个高个子吗012---That tall guy on the first floor?
才不是呢012---No!
怎么  我觉得他很帅啊012---What? I think he's cute.
那你可以去怀他的孩子012---Then you have his baby.
相信我  我正在努力012---Believe me, I'm trying.
这种感觉真奇怪  你今天就要告诉这个男人012---It's so weird. You're gonna tell this guy today...
而他完全不知道会发生什么事012---...and he has no idea what's gonna happen.
你马上就要敲开他的门012---Yeah. You're just gonna knock on his door
永远改变他的生活012---and change his life forever.
你就像艾德·麦马汉012---You're like Ed McMahon,
只是手上没有拿大额支票012---except without the big check.
也缺乏原始的性吸引力012---Or the raw sexual magnetism.
对  这确实是个大消息012---Yeah, well, I guess it is pretty big news.
大消息  这可是个天大的消息012---Pretty big? It's huge!
天啊  这个男人什么都不知道012---God, this guy doesn't have a clue.
他走在街上心想012---He's just walking down the street thinking,
"我跟瑞秋·格林做爱了  我太帅了"012---"I had sex with Rachel Greene. I rock!"
然后  砰  他突然当了爸爸  一切都变了012---Then, bam! He's a father, everything's different.
除非他真的想当爸爸012---It's only different if he wants it to be.
我不会对他提出任何要求012---I'm not gonna ask him for anything.
他还是得做出重大的决定012---Okay, then. He still has this huge decision to make.
现在他边走边想012---Now he's walking around thinking,
"我要当爸爸吗"  然后  砰012---"Do I want to be a dad?" Then, bam!
这次怎么了012---What was that "bam"?
我不知道  他可能是被公车撞了012---I don't know. He's hit by a bus, or something.
乔伊  如果跟你上过床的女人012---Joey, what would you do if someone you slept with
告诉你她怀孕了  你会怎么办012---told you she was pregnant?
谁打电话过来了012---Who called here?
她听起来像金发美女吗012---Did she sound blond?
她有口音吗  我得去打个电话012---Did she have an accent? I gotta make a call.
我就不该进太阳眼镜屋的012---Should have never walked into that Sunglass Hut!
不是你  你没有让任何人怀孕012---Joey, Joey. It's not you! You didn't get anybody pregnant.
你为什么要那样子吓我012---Why would you scare me like that?
发生了什么事012---What the hell's going on?
有人怀孕了吗012---Is somebody pregnant?
对  我怀孕了012---Oh, yeah! That's me.
天啊  菲比 你要生孩子了012---Oh, my God, Pheebs! You're gonna have a baby?
对  天啊  我要生孩子了012---Yes, I am. Oh, my God, I'm gonna have a baby!
等一下  孩子他爸是谁012---Wait a minute, who's the father?
你不认识他  那不重要012---You don't know him. It's not important.
他不希望跟我或孩子扯上关系012---He wants nothing to do with me or the baby.
这家伙是谁012---Who is this guy? Who is he?
我要找到他  痛扁他一顿012---Because I will track him down and kick his ass!
大卫·林恩  大卫·林恩012--- David Linn.  David Linn!
大卫`林恩  大卫`林恩012---David Linn. David Linn!
谁是大卫·林恩012---Who's David Linn?
我在健身房认识的人  他有点烦人012---Some guy from my gym. Little annoying.
钱德勒  你找到即可拍了吗012--- Chandler?  Did you find the cameras?
没有  你呢  我找到了012--- No. Did you?  Yes.
所以我才趴在桌底下  庆祝这一幸事012---That's why I'm under the table, celebrating.
我去失物招领中心问过管理员012---I checked in the lost and found. I talked to the manager.
没有人捡到即可拍012---No one's turned them in.
这下可好了  今天只有那些即可拍012---This is great. Those cameras were the only thing
才能让莫妮卡打起精神来  她心情很低落012---that was gonna cheer Monica up today. She's really depressed.
你们刚刚结婚  她为什么心情不好012---You guys just got married. Why is she so depressed?
我卯足了劲不去问她那个问题012---All my energy is going into not asking that question.
不敢相信我给搞砸了012---I can't believe I screwed this up!
我很遗憾  兄弟012---I'm sorry, man.
我有个点子  你们就是在这个宴会厅请的客012---Here's a thought. This is the same ballroom.
这里有乐队  等一下会有很多人盛装前来012---There's a band. There's gonna be plenty of dressedup people.
你是说我们可以一跳解千愁012---Are you suggesting we dance our troubles away?
不  我是说我们到礼品店买一些即可拍012---No, no, no, I'm saying we buy more of these at the gift shop...
换上礼服拍几张照片012---...throw our tuxes back on and take a few pictures.
我们只要不拍到任何人的脸就行012---All we have to make sure not to get anybody's faces.
你是认真的吗012---Are you serious?
我是想到在家等你的新娘012---I'm just thinking about your new bride at home, okay?
你想在携手共度一生的第一天就让她失望吗012---Do you want to start your life together by letting her down?
你真的要给我关于婚姻的建议吗012---Marriage advice? Really?
我是在告诉你  这看起来很像你的婚宴现场012---I'm telling you, this looks exactly like your wedding.
连这些花都是一样吧012---Aren't these the same flowers?
我不知道  花是莫妮卡挑的012---I don't know. Monica picked out the flowers.
椅子呢  也是她挑的012--- What about the chairs?  She picked out those too.
那会场布置呢  她挑的012--- How about the place settings?  That was her.
你做了什么  我负责看好照相机012--- What did you do?  I was in charge of the cameras.
去礼品店吧012---Gift shop?
你说了吗  还没有012--- Did you do it yet?  Not yet.
那么你在这里做什么  你准备要说了吗012---Then what are you doing here? Are you about to do it?
是甘瑟吗  不是012--- Is it Gunther?  No.
不是甘瑟012---Phoebe, it's not Gunther!
谢天谢地  还好宝宝不会随他的头发012---Thank God. Because that hair on a baby?
孩子他爸不在这里012---Phoebe, the father is not here, okay?
我还没有告诉他  我现在根本没办法告诉他012---I haven't told him yet. I don't think I can tell him at all now.
为什么  让我想想012--- Why not?  I don't konw. Let me think.
我在街上边走边想012---I was walking down the street, thinking,
"我今天要告诉孩子他爸了"  然后  砰012---"I'm gonna tell the father." And then, bam!
你被公车撞了吗012---Bus?
不  是你  我被你吓到了012---No, you! Phoebe, you freaked me out.
你一直在提醒我这是件大事012---You kept saying how huge this all is.
但这的确是件大事012---But it is huge.
我知道  但我只是在想这对我来说有多重要012---I know. But I was just thinking about how huge it was for me.
我根本没去想这对孩子他爸来说有多重要012---I didn't even go to how huge it'll be for the father.
你想得太多了012---You're thinking about this way too much.
就直接告诉他  把事情做个了断012---Just tell him and get it over with.
就像撕掉创可贴一样  越快越不痛  你看012---It's like ripping off this BandAid, quick and painless. Watch.
天杀的...012---Oh, mother of...!
看吧012---See?
要拆礼物了吗012---Are we opening presents?
不  我根本不该拆礼物012---No. I shouldn't have even opened these.
乔伊  我控制不了自己012---Joey, I am out of control!
你得帮我一个忙012---Joey, you have to do me a favor.
不论我说什么  不论我做什么012---No matter what I say, no matter what I do...
拜托  不要让我再拆礼物了  好吗012---...please, do not let me open another present. Okay?
好012---Okay.
再给我一个礼物  好012--- Give me one more.  Okay.

坐下  我要告诉你一件事  好吧012--- Sit down, I got something I wanna say.  All right.
外面的世界很可怕012---It's a scary world out there,
特别是对单亲妈妈来说012---especially for a single mom.
我一直觉得你我之间有种特殊的联系012---I've always felt that you and I have a special bond.
所以...012---So...
菲比·布菲  你愿意嫁给我吗012---Phoebe Buffay, will you marry me?
我的天啊012---Oh, my God!
乔伊  我愿意嫁给你012--- Joey.  Oh, yeah, I'll marry you.
你不能嫁给他012---You can't marry him!
小姐  你的风光之日过去了  这次轮到我了012---Hey, lady, your day's over. It's my turn.
菲比  她为什么不能嫁给我012--- Phoebe.  Why can't she marry me?

孩子他爸是谁012---Who's the father?
我们不知道012---We don't know.
不知道是不是那个家伙012---I wonder if it's that dude.
你知道有这么个人  对012--- There's a dude?  Yeah.

你的手指挡到镜头了012---Your finger was covering the lens.
你是安瑟·亚当斯吗  快滚吧012---Who are you, Ansel Adams? Get out of here! 
之前吓到你了  我真的很过意不去012---Look, I feel really bad about how I freaked you out before...
所以我打电话把孩子他爸叫到这里见你012---...so I called the father and asked the father to meet you here
你可以告诉他事实  去吧012---so you could tell him. Go!
什么  等一下012---What? Wait a minute.
你怎么知道孩子他爸是谁012---Phoebe, how do you even know who the father is?
或许有时候我会装傻012---I may play the fool at times...
但事实上我是个永不放弃的金发美女012---but I'm more than a pretty blond girl with an ass that won't quit.
我相信这是孩子他爸的衣服012---I believe this belongs to the father of your baby...
天啊012---Oh, God.
他就在里面吗012---He's in there right now?
你可以转身离开  或是长痛不如短痛012---You can turn around, or you can go rip the BandAid off.

绿色的利萨布尔  对012--- A green LeSabre?  Yes!
抱歉  我是说蓝色的利萨布尔012---I'm sorry, I meant a blue LeSabre.
对  我的车是蓝绿色的012---Yes, greenblue.
快去把车移开吧012---Well, go. Go move it!

好  拍完马上就跑012--- Yeah.  Get ready to run.
恭贺新婚012---Congratulations on your wedding.
这是怎么一回事012---So, what's this about?
瑞秋有事要告诉你012---Rachel has something she wants to tell you.
我敢肯定这是你的红毛衣012---And I believe that this is your red sweater.
不  这才是我的红毛衣012---No, this is my red sweater.
不是吧012---Oh, no.
有人要喝咖啡吗012---Could I get anyone a coffee?
或是毒药  没有吗  只有我要喝  好吧012---Or poison? No? Just for me? Okay.
发生了什么事  瑞秋012---What's going on, Rach?
没事  菲比搞错了012---Nothing. Phoebe kind of made a mistake.
但你的确常穿那件毛衣012---But you do wear that sweater a lot.
你这是在玩什么"大冒险"吗012---Are you involved in some kind of dare?
事实上我很高兴能接到菲比的电话012---I'm actually glad Phoebe called.
我知道我们会分手是因为你觉得我太幼稚012---I know we broke up because you thought I was immature enough,
但我已经长大了012---but I've really grown up.
我觉得我们应该复合012---I think we should get back together.
时机不对012---It's just not the right time.
时机非常恰当  好吧012--- It is the right time.  Okay.
我做了万全的准备012---I'm ready for more.
泰格  来吧  瑞秋我们再试一次012--- Tag.  Come on, Rach. Let's give it another try.
我怀孕了012---I'm having a baby.
你可以走了  谢谢012--- You can go.  Thank you.
我不知道这些礼物怎么会是打开的012---I don't know how any of these got opened!
你拆开了所有的礼物012---You opened them all?
我知道  我太不靠谱了012---I know, I know I am a terrible person.
钱德勒再也不会相信我了012---Chandler's never gonna trust me with anything ever again.
你拆开了我爸妈的礼物012---You got my parents' gift.
那是什么012---Yeah. What is that?
应该是跟意大利腊肠有关的东西012---I don't know. I think it does something to salami.
情况如何  泰格怎么说012--- How'd it go?  What did Tag say?
泰格不是孩子他爸  乔伊竟然知道了012---Tag is not the father. And Joey knows now?
我知道了  瑞秋  我为你感到高兴012---I do, Rach, I do. And I am so happy for you.
你竟然没想要解开我的胸罩012---Wow, you didn't even try to unook my bra.
你还打算要告诉孩子他爸吗012---So are you ever gonna tell whoever it is?
我会的  我只是不想今晚告诉他012---I will. I'm just not up for it tonight.
不论这家伙怎么说012---Rach, no matter what this guy says,
你都不会独自面对这一切012---I want you to know you're not gonna be alone in this.
是吗  不  听着...012--- I'm not?  No. Listen, I...
外面的世界很可怕012---It's a scary world out there,
特别是对单亲妈妈来说012---especially for a single mom.
我一直觉得我跟你之间有种特殊的联系012---I've always felt like you and I have this special bond, you know?
瑞秋·格林  你愿意嫁给我吗  什么012--- Rachel Greene, will you marry me?  What?
什么  什么012--- What?  What?!
菲比  把戒指还给我  不要012--- Pheebs, give me the ring back.  No!
乔伊  你真的很体贴012---No, Joey, you're so sweet, you're so, so sweet, honey.
但我现在不需要丈夫012---But I'm not looking for a husband.
我了解012---I understand.
失陪了  我想去躺一下012---Well, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go and lie down.
我不能说我不心痛012---I can't say that didn't hurt.
但我会原谅你  乔伊·崔比安尼012---But I'll take you back, Joey Tribbiani.
听着  我只是说...012---Yeah, Pheebs. Listen, about that, I only offered...
意大利腊肠用具  是啊012--- Ooh, a Salami Buddy!  There you go!
我们回来了  太棒了012--- We're back!  Great.
我们待在厨房吧  待在厨房就好了012---We're hanging in the kitchen. Let's stay in the kitchen.
现在是看照片时间  你一定会喜欢的012--- It's picture time.  You're gonna love these.
这是罗斯的照片012---Here's a picture of Ross.
这是我012---And that's me.
这是我跟罗斯012---And that's me and Ross.
这是我们第一次以新婚夫妻身份接吻的照片012---And here's a picture of our first kiss as a married couple.
那张照片真的很棒012---Wow, that is a great picture. Yeah!
有意思的是  我在我们的行李里012---And interesting, because I found the cameras
找到了即可拍012---in one of our bags.
我没想到会这样012---Didn't see that coming.
这不是我们第一次接吻的照片012---Okay. So this isn't a picture of our first kiss...
但这的确是我跟这位女士第一次接吻的照片012---...but it is a picture of my first kiss with this lady.
从你脸上的表情看来012---Which, by the look on your face,
我相信你会记得这个画面  所以我不必...012---I'm sure you'll remember, so there's no need...
我会拿真的底片去洗012---How about I'll take the real pictures to get developed right now.
好主意  好012--- That'd be a good idea.  Okay.
你不管我  自己拆了所有礼物012---You opened all the presents without me?
我们说好要一起拆的012---I thought we were supposed to do that together.
你吻了另一个女人012---You kissed another woman?!
我们扯平了  好吧012--- Call it even?  Okay.
我要把花插到花瓶里012---I'm gonna go get these in some water.
那是你从人家婚礼上偷的吗012---You stole those from these people's wedding?
不  这是酒店大厅的花012---No, I took them from the hotel lobby.
他们以为能多收我黄片012---They think they can charge me for some dirty movie...
还有一袋糖果的钱  我一定要讨回公道012---...and a bag of Mashuga Nuts, they got another thing coming!
我的毛衣012---Hey, my sweater!
我找这件毛衣找了一个月012---I've been looking for this for, like a month.
我的天啊012---Oh, my God!
我的天啊012---Oh, my God!
你好吗  我很好  好久不见012--- Hey, how you doing?  Good. Long time no see.
我喜欢你的毛衣  我也是012--- Like your sweater.  Right back at you.
瑞秋的事真的太疯狂了012---It's crazy about Rachel.
她一直都疯疯癫癫的012---Well, she's one crazy lady.
到底是谁的呢012---So whose is it?
我不知道  应该是个意大利人吧012---I don't know, some Italian guy.
少来了  看你自己的标签去012---Come on, read your own label.
后会有期  他真是个怪人012---See you later. He is so weird.

谢谢  我最好去打包行李012--- Thanks.  I better go pack.
不  我已经打好包了012---No, I already packed.
我只是找不到你的迷你泳裤了012---The only thing I couldn't find, though, was your Speedo.
我没有迷你泳裤012---Speedo? I don't have a Speedo.
我要去打包我那条普通的超长泳裤012---I'm gonna go pack my regular, long bathing suit.
很好  你还在012---Good, you're still here!
我想来祝你有个愉快的蜜月012---I wanted to tell you to have a good honeymoon.
谢谢012---Thank you!
我还要你们知道012---And I also wanted you guys to know that
今天我会告诉孩子他爸012---I am telling the father today.
怎么了012---What? What? What?
我们知道孩子他爸是罗斯012---We know it's Ross.
你怎么知道的012---How? How do you know?
那是他的毛衣  我们都又惊又喜012---It was his sweater. But, oh, my God!
我好希望罗斯是第一个知道的012---I so wanted Ross to know first.
但你们知道了  我真的松了一口气012---But I am so relieved that you guys know!
这真的是太棒了012---That is so great.
我要当姑姑了  我知道012--- And I'm gonna be your baby's aunt!  I know.
我要当阿姨了012---Me too!
我要当叔叔了  来吧012---And I'm gonna be an uncle! Come here.
你们要当孩子的姑姑  阿姨跟叔叔了012---You're all gonna be aunts and uncles.
对  但只有我跟孩子有血缘关系012---Yeah, but I'm the only one related by blood.
现在你们知道了  你们可以帮我012---Great! So now that you all know, you can help me.
建议我该怎么跟罗斯说012---Give me some advice on how to I'm gonna tell Ross.
你打算怎么说012---What were you gonna say?
我要告诉他我想留下孩子012---I was gonna tell him that I'm gonna have the baby,
他想怎么做都可以012---and he can be as involved as he wants.
听起来很不错012---Well, that sounds good.
对  但我该怎么开口呢012---Yeah, but, you know, how do I start?
我是说我的开场白应该是什么012---I mean, what's the first thing that I say?
好吧  太棒了  谢谢012---Okay, great. Thanks.
祝你好运   再见012--- Hey, good luck.  Yeah, bye.
刚才是怎么一回事012---Hey, what was that all about?
看来现在告诉你也没关系了012---Well, I guess there's no harm in telling you now.
瑞秋怀了罗斯的孩子012---Rachel and Ross are going to have a baby.
什么012---What?!
我完全不知道  你为什么不告诉我012---I didn't even know that...!Why didn't you tell me?
我为什么会这用这种声音说话012---Why am I talking like this?
我觉得你藏不住秘密012---I didn't think you could keep it a secret.
什么012---What?!
我的嘴可严了012---I am an excellent secretkeeper.
我一直保守着我们所有的秘密012---I have kept all our secrets.
什么秘密  不  乔伊012--- What secrets?  No, no, Joey.
我不会告诉你  因为我的嘴很严012---I'm not gonna tell you, because I am an excellent secretkeeper.

罗斯跟瑞秋就要生宝宝了012---Ross and Rachel are having a baby.
或许你跟我也该找些事来做012---Maybe you and I should do something.
别急  吾爱  等到合适的时机吧012---All in good time, my love. All in good time.
该死  我把吉他放在他们家了012---Shoot! I left my guitar in their apartment.
你待会能帮我开门吧012---Well, you can let me in later, right?
不行  我没有钥匙012---No, I don't have a key.
他们拿走我的钥匙说是要交给你012---They took mine to give to you.
什么  他们拿走我的说是要交给你012---What? They took mine to give to you.
他们为什么要拿走我们的钥匙012---Why would they take away our keys?
或许他们不信任我们012---Maybe they don't trust us.
不对啊  他们上次出城时012---That's not it. They let me keep my key
还让我帮他们保管钥匙012---the last time they were out of town.
那次你打破番茄酱瓶012---You mean the time you broke the ketchup bottle
拿莫妮卡给客人准备的毛巾来清理012---and cleaned it with Monica's guest towels?
我洗了毛巾  才没有012--- Hey, I washed those.  No, you didn't.
对  那听起来不像我的作风012---Yeah, that didn't sound like me.
我该怎么办  我真的要用吉他012---What am I gonna do? I really need my guitar.
我也有东西放在他们家012---I have stuff in there too.
什么东西  莫妮卡的奶酪鸡排012--- What stuff?  Monica's chicken parm.

煤气泄漏  带大蒜面包过来012---Gas leak. Oh, and bring garlic bread.
瑞秋找到你了吗  没有  怎么了012--- Did Rachel find you?  No, why?
她在找你012---She was looking for you.
那我待会再见她012---Well, I guess I'll catch up with her later.
她真的得马上跟你谈012---She really wanted to talk to you now.
对  似乎是有重要的事012---Yeah, it seemed pretty important.
不012---Oh, no.
怎么012---What?
我想我知道她要跟我谈什么了012---I think I might know what this is about.
真的吗012---Really?
对012---Yeah.
我们答应不会告诉任何人  但是...012---We promised we weren't gonna tell anybody this, but...
大约一个月前瑞秋跟我上床了012---About a month ago, Rachel and I slept together.
结果呢012---And?
我以为你们会大吃一惊012---Wow, I thought you'd be a little more shocked.
抱歉  结果呢012---Oh, sorry. And?!
我们说只做一次...012---Well, we said we'd just do it that one time...
我想她现在或许想要跟我复合012---...but now I think she may wanna start things up again.
我想不是那样的012---Yeah, I don't think that's what it is.
怎么  不然会是什么事012---Why? What else could it be?
我觉得不太舒服012---Oh, wow, I don't feel well.
我觉得就是那么一回事012---I'm telling you, I'm telling you, that's what it is.
难怪在婚礼上  她看我的眼神怪怪的012---No wonder she was looking at me all funny during the wedding.
她什么都没有告诉你们吗012---She didn't say anything to you?
或许你吃错东西了  有可能012--- Maybe it's something you ate.  Could be, yeah.
拜托  去跟瑞秋谈一谈  好吧012--- Please, just go and talk to Rachel.  Yeah, I guess I should.
你们知道我领悟到什么事吗012---Man, you know what I have to realize?
或许我是那种让女人一夜难忘的男人012---Maybe I'm not the type of guy women can have just one night with.
她们对我永远都觉得不满足012---You know, they always seem to want a little bit more.
我应该记住那一点012---I should remember that.
下一位012---Next.
他们在接吻  我们先过去吧012---They're kissing. Let's just go around them.

抱歉  我们没有听到012---Sorry, we didn't hear you.
我们要去度蜜月012---We're on our honeymoon.
让我来看一下012---Let me see what I can do.

你听到没有012---Did you hear that?
她让他们升级到头等舱012---They bumped them up to first class
因为他们要去度蜜月012---because they're on their honeymoon!
我们假装也要去度蜜月012---Come on. Let's act like we're on our honeymoon.
我们的确是要去度蜜月012---We are on our honeymoon.
快摸我屁股012---Grab my ass.
下一位  抱歉  我差点没听见012--- Next.  Hi. Sorry, I almost didn't hear you,

刚刚那对夫妻拿走最后两个位置012---That couple got the last two.
看吧  如果你听我的话  插他们的队012---See? If we'd gone around them like I said,
她会给我们头等舱的位置  该死012---she'd have given us those tickets! Damn it!
25J跟K会不会刚好不连在一起012---25J and K, any chance those aren't together?
我还是不敢相信他们拿走了我的钥匙012---I still can't believe they took away my key.
你都把你的钥匙交给我保管012---I mean, you trust me with yours.
那当然  等清理钥匙的人把它擦干挣之后012---Of course I do! And I'm gonna get it back to you just as soon as
我就会还给你012---they're done with it at the keyshining place.
那是什么声音  我不知道012--- What the hell is that?  I don't know.
崔格  你在做什么012---Treeger, what are you doing?
你说有煤气泄漏012---You said there was a gas leak in here.
你为什么不用钥匙开门012---Why not use your key?
等我找到他们家的钥匙012---Because by the time I found it on this thing,
这间公寓可能都炸掉了012---the whole place might have exploded.
如果我管理的公寓再发生一次爆炸意外012---If that happens at another building I manage,
人们会开始问问题012---people will ask questions.
快一点012---Come on, hurry up!
要那么做我们也会012---Well, we could have done that.
你看  他们走进头等舱休息室了012---Look at that! They're going into the firstclass lounge.
你知道里面有什么吗  不知道012--- Do you know what they have in there?  No.
我也不知道  我们得进去才行012---Me neither. We have to get in!
装做你是头等舱的客人  天啊  有橘子012--- Just act like you belong.  Oh, my God! Oranges!
很高兴又跟你见面了012---Nice to see you again.
先生  麻烦出示你的机票012---Sir, may I see your tickets, please?
没问题012---Yes, of course.
抱歉  麻烦将你的姆指挪开012---I'm sorry. Would you move your thumb?
我看不到座位号码012---I can't see the seat number.
没关系  我已经背下来了  是1A012---That's all right. I have it memorized. It's 1 A.
这不是头等舱的机票  抱歉012---Sir, this isn't a firstclass ticket. I'm sorry.
没关系  不好意思012---Apology accepted. Excuse us.
先生  恐怕我得请你们离开012---Sir, I'm afraid I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.
好吧012---Fine.
快跑012---Go, go, go!
我想我们真的需要好好谈一谈012---I think there's something that we really need to talk about.
没错  我们先进去吧012---I think we do. Why don't we go inside.
我知道你为什么会来找我  真的吗012--- Look, I know why you're here.  You do?
对  为了让你别太尴尬012---Yeah, and to save you from any embarrassment...

好吧  好吗012--- Okay.  Okay?
罗斯跟瑞秋012---Ross and Rachel.
瑞秋跟罗斯012---Rachel and Ross.
很像是在玩跷跷板  对吧012---That's been one heck of a seesaw, hasn't it?
什么012---What?
我是说那晚012---I mean, look, that one night
我们过得既满足又尽性012---we had was fun and certainly passionate.
但你不觉得我们还是当朋友比较好吗012---But don't you think it's better if we just stay friends?
你是说...什么012---Seriously, what?
好吧  这样好了012---Okay, okay. You know what?
如果你想的话  我们可以再做一次012---If you want to, we can do it one more time.

怎么会发生这种事012---...how this happened.
我们有用安全套  我知道012--- We used a condom.  I know.
但安全套的避孕率只有97%012---But you know, condoms only work, like, 97 percent of the time.
什么012---What?
什么012---What?!
他们应该标示在包装上012---Well, they should put that on the box!
包装上有标示  才没有012--- They do.  No, they don't!
他们应该用又大又粗的字体标示在包装上012---Well, they should put it in huge block letters!
罗斯  别管安全套的事012---Ross, let's just forget about the condoms.
早知道当时也不用管了012---Well, I may as well have!
你知道吗  我发现自己怀孕时...012---Listen, you know what? I was really freaked out too...
也吓坏了  吓坏了  我才没有012---...when I found out.  Freaked...?Hey, I'm not freaked out.
作为消费者  我很愤怒012---I'm indignant as a consumer!
你知道吗  我们待会再谈012---You know what? Let's talk later.

或许我该待会再来  好吧012---Okay, you know what? Maybe I should come back... Okay.
好吧  我按一012---Yeah, I'll press one!
我到处都检查过  没有煤气泄漏012---I looked everywhere. There's no gas leak.
我可以热一下这个吗012---So then I can heat this up?
总之我会帮他装扇新门012---Anyway, I'll get moving on that new door.
太棒了  你能帮我们一个忙012---Great. Listen, could you do us a favor
别跟钱德勒和莫妮卡提这件事吗012---and not tell Chandler and Monica about this?
因为他们没有自己的孩子...012---Because, you know, they don't have any kids of their own...
这扇门就像是他们的孩子012---...and this door was like a child to them.
我得装上新锁012---Well, I'm gonna have to put on a new lock.
他们一定会发现的012---They'll find out anyway.
不是吧012---Oh, no.
看样子要干一整天012---It's looking like an allday job.
我得去取消我的瑜伽课012---I'm gonna have to cancel my yoga class.
罗斯  麻烦你告诉茉莉012---Hey, Ross. Could you tell Jasmine
今天我没办法去上瑜伽课  没问题012--- I can't make it to yoga class today?  Sure.
再见  再见012--- Namaste.  Namaste.
天啊  门是怎么了012---Oh, my God! What happened to the door?
看来很明显012---So it's noticeable, huh?
瑞秋在这里吗  我得跟她谈一谈012---Look, is Rachel here? I need to talk to her.
你们不是谈过了吗012---Didn't you two already talk?
对  但是012---Yeah, but...
听着  你们知道  瑞秋跟我上过床012---Okay. Look, you guys know that Rachel and I slept together...
但除此之外还有别的事012---...but there's something else.
瑞秋怀孕了012---Rachel's pregnant.
我的老天爷  天啊  我不敢相信012--- Holy mother of God!  Oh, my God, I can't believe that!
她怀了我的孩子  我是第一次听到这件事012--- With my child.  That is brandnew information!
你们已经知道了对不对  知道一点012--- You already know, don't you?  Little bit.
你还好吗  我会没事的012--- How you doing?  Okay. I mean, I'll be okay.
我觉得自己处理得不够好012---It's just, I don't think I handled it very well.
你跟她说了什么  什么都没说012--- What'd you say to her?  Nothing.
但我跟安全套公司的客服部门倒是说了不少012---But the complaint department at the condom company got an earful.
我一转身才发现她走了  罗斯012--- Then when I turned around, she was gone.  Oh, Ross.
我知道  但我刚刚才发现012---I know. But in my defense,
安全套只有97%的避孕率012---I just found out that condoms are only, like, 97% effective.
什么  我得去找她012--- What?  I gotta go find her.
等一下  你是认真的吗012---Hey. Hold on! Are you serious?
所以安全套有3%的机率不起作用012---So, like, 3 percent of the time, they don't even work?
他们应该在包装上做标示012---They should put that on the box!
他们的确做了标示  什么012--- Evidently, they do.  What?!
我不敢相信我们到这里了012---I can't believe we're here.
开什么玩笑  怎么012--- You've gotta be kidding.  What?
为了庆祝你们新婚012---As a wedding gift to you,
酒店要帮你们升级到蜜月套房012---the hotel would like to give you the honeymoon suite.
不  你们一整天都跟我们过不去012---No! You have been screwing us all day!
你们是谁  我们就是你们012--- Who are you?  We're you.
只是迟了十秒钟012---Just 10 seconds later!
你们已经抢走头等舱的位置和休息室012---You already got the firstclass tickets, you got the lounge.
我们也应该得到免费招待012---We should get free stuff too!
不光是你们在度蜜月012---You're not the only ones on your honeymoon!
我们可以把蜜月套房让给你们012---You can have the suite if you want.
我们不在乎要睡在哪里012---We don't care about where we stay.
我们来这里纪念我们对彼此的爱012---We're here to celebrate our love for each other.
我们不需要免费招待012---We don't have to get free stuff.
我们只想在一起012---We just want to be together.
我们需要免费招待012---We need the stuff.
莫妮卡  我是乔伊012---Monica, it's Joey. Listen.
菲比跟我闻到你家有煤气味012---Phoebe and I smell gas coming from your apartment.
什么  真的吗  乔伊闻到有煤气味012---What? Are you serious? Joey smells gas.
还有什么新消息012---What else is new?
我们想进去看看  但你拿走了我们的钥匙012---We'd check it out, but you took our keys.
快想办法进去012---Well, do something. Get in there!
要怎么办呢  我可以把你家大门撞开012---How? I guess I could break down your door.
对  就那么做012---Yeah, do that.
你不会怪我们弄坏东西  不会012--- And you won't blame us for any damage?  No.
你在撞门了吗  我没有听到声音  快呀012---Are you doing it? I don't hear anything. Come on.
好吧  我来撞门了012---Okay, I'll break it down.
他正在撞门  他要把门撞开了012---Hi. He's doing it, he's breaking down the door.
好了  我们进来了012---Okay, we're in.
瑞秋  你感觉舒服吗012---Okay, Rachel, are you comfortable?
如果我说很舒服  你会另眼看我吗012---If I said I was, would you judge me?
医生马上过来帮你照超声波012---The doctor'll be here in a minute to do your sonogram.
好的012---Okay.
天啊  我发誓  如果他们在家具店卖这个012---Oh, man, I swear, if they sold these at Pottery Barn...
我们得谈一谈012---We need to talk.
现在吗  我现在的姿势有点不雅012---Right now? Because I kind of got an alfresco situation going on over here.
拜托  我真的...012---Please, I really...
我想为我刚刚的表现向你道歉012---I want to apologize for the way I acted earlier today.
没关系  麻烦你待在床头边012---Okay, Ross. That's fine. Can you stay up near my head?
什么  抱歉012---What? Oh, yeah, sorry.
我被冲昏头了  我只想到自己012---I think I went a little crazy. I was thinking about myself
我应该要为你着想012---when I should've been thinking about you...
没关系  待在床头这边  罗斯  好012--- Okay, head, Ross! Head, Ross!  Right.
我要你知道012---I want you to know that
我会一直陪在你身边  好吗012---I'm gonna be there through this whole thing. Okay?
来做产检  上拉梅兹呼吸课012---The doctor's appointments, the Lamaze classes,
在公寓里为宝宝安装保护措施012---babyproofing the apartment.
但我们可以等到婚后再担心那些事012---Although, we can worry about that after we get married.
婚后  对  我想我们应该结婚012--- Married?  Well, yeah, I think we should get married.
你一遇到问题就用结婚来解决吗012---Because that's your answer to everything?
不  那么做是对的012---No. Because that's the right thing to do.
或许吧  只要我们相爱012---Yeah, maybe, if you're in love.
可是罗斯  我们并不相爱  对吧012---But Ross, we are not in love, are we?
对  但是你不可能一个人处理这件事012---No. But still, I mean, you can't possibly do this alone.
你说什么012---Excuse me?
你甚至没办法一个人在餐厅吃饭012---Come on, Rach. You can't even eat alone in a restaurant.
什么  如果你没办法一个人吃饭012--- What?  I'm just saying if you can't eat by yourself,
你怎么一个人带孩子012---how do you expect to have a baby by yourself?
我可以一个人吃饭012---I can too eat by myself!
你什么时候一个人吃过012---When have you ever?
当某些同桌的人吃完饭012---When certain people leave the table
我还没有吃完的时候012---and I am not finished!
有些人光喝一碗汤就得花掉两个小时012---Well, certain other people take two hours to eat a bowl of soup!
拜托  是你狼吞虎咽012---Oh, please. You inale your food.
我跟莫妮卡一起长大012---I grew up with Monica.
不吃快一点的话就没得吃了012---If you didn't eat fast, you didn't eat!
我打扰你们了吗012---Am I interrupting?
不  朗格医生  请进012---No, Dr. Long. Please come in.
他是罗斯  孩子的爸爸012---This is Ross. He is the father.
但我不是她的丈夫  因为显然她能单独带大孩子012---But not the husband, because, evidently, she can do this alone.
很高兴能见到你  我要开始检查了012---Nice to meet you. I'll get started on this.
你为什么不能承认你需要我012---I don't know why you can't admit you need me?
我的确需要你  我需要你站在床头这边012---I do need you. I need you to stay near my head!
好吧  看起来很正常012---Okay. Everything looks good.
银幕上的画面是这样的012---Here it is on the screen.
这是你的子宫...012---Here's your uterus...
宝宝在这里012---...and right here is your baby.
天啊012---Oh, my God.
它在那里  我看到了012---There it is. I see it.
恭喜  我让你们独处一下012---Congratulations. I'll give you two a minute.
好吧  谢谢012--- Okay.  Thank you.
很神奇吧012---Pretty amazing, huh?
我看不到012---I don't see it!
什么  我看不到012--- What? What?  I can't see it.
但你说你看到了012---But you just said that you did.
我知道  我说谎了012---I know. I lied.
我不希望她认为我是个很糟糕的母亲012---I didn't want her to think I was a terrible mother.
我连自己的宝宝都看不到012---I can't even see my own baby!
过来  你可以看到的012---Oh, sure. Come here. Sure, you can.
过来  就在这里012---Come here. Look, it's right there.
好漂亮012---Oh, it's beautiful.
我看到了012---I see it now.
真的吗  不  我看不到012--- Do you really?  No, I don't see it!
好吧  来吧012---Okay. Come on. All right. Okay.
你看到那个像花生一样的小东西了吗012---You see this tiny thing that looks like a peanut?
是的012---Yeah.
亲爱的  就是那个012---Sweetie, that's it.
就是那个012---That's it?
我看到了012---Well, I saw that.
谢谢  别客气012--- Thank you.  You're welcome.
我不敢相信那是我们的孩子012---Wow, I can't believe that's our baby.
对  那是我们的孩子012---Yeah, that's our baby.
医生怎么说012---So how was the doctor?
一切都很顺利012---Everything went great.
很好  让他们看看你子宫的照片012--- Good.  Hey, show them the picture of your uterus.
我看不到宝宝  它在哪里012---I don't see the baby. Where is it?
我知道  刚开始我也看不到012---Oh, no, I know. I couldn't see it either at first.
但它就在...012---But it's right...
罗斯  我又看不到了012---Ross, I lost it again.
等一下  在进屋之前我要你知道012---Wait. Before we go in, I just want you to know that
我爱你012---I love you.
我蜜月时玩得很高兴012---I had a great time on our honeymoon.
我等不及要跟你共度一生了012---I can't wait to spend the rest of our life together.
你还戴着那条贝壳项链012---You're sticking with the shell necklace, huh?
你们回来了012---You're back!
快进来012---Come on in!
你们蜜月玩得开心吗012---How was the honeymoon?

蜜月过得不错啊  小子012---Good honeymooning, tiger.
他们很酷  他们也是去度蜜月的012---They're really cool. They were on their honeymoon too.
他们人超好  就住在城里012---They're terrific.They live here in the city.
我们能打电话给他们吗  现在打会不会太快了012---Can we go call them? Is it too soon to call?
我想打给他们012---I wanna call.
抱歉  我们很兴奋012---I'm sorry. We're just kind of excited.
我们终于认识一对夫妇朋友了012---We finally have a couple to hang out with.
夫妇朋友  你是指两个人吗012---A couple? Like two people?
像是一  二  两个人吗012---Like one, two people?
那不一样  葛瑞格跟珍妮结婚了012---This is different. Greg and Jenny are in a relationship.
葛瑞格跟珍妮012---Greg and Jenny?
"葛瑞格  我是钱德勒  这是莫妮卡"012---"Hi, Greg. I'm Chandler. This is Monica"
"嗨  莫妮卡  她是珍妮"012---"Hi, Monica. This is Jenny."
"嗨  珍妮  嗨  葛瑞格"012---"Hi, Jenny. Hi, Greg."
他们真的很棒  如果你们  你知道吗012--- They're great. If you just got a chance...  You know what?
快送我们纪念品  然后滚出去012---Why don't you just give us our souvenirs and get out of here.
我们没来得及...  你开玩笑吧012--- We didn't get a chance to...  You've gotta to be kidding me!
我们没给任何人买礼物012---We didn't get anything for anyone.
好漂亮的项链012---Yeah. Nice necklace.
这个可以送给你012---That you can have.
《老友记》  第八季  第4集  录像带012---Friends S08E04 The One With The Videotape

你看  我有宝宝的B超  太棒了012--- Look, I have a sonogram picture.  Good.
罗斯  宝宝遗传了你的黑色卷发012---Ross, it's got your wavy, black lines.
现在罗斯知道了  到底是怎么发生的012---Now that Ross knows, can you tell us how'd it happen?
在什么时候  你们做了几次012---When did it happen? How many times does it happen?
莫妮卡  那么问是不对的012---Monica, that's not right.
从你们在哪里做开始说吧012---Start with where.
事情发生在六个星期前012---It happened about six weeks ago.
我回到家  发现罗斯也在012---I just got home from work and Ross was already there.
他跟乔伊在一起玩012---Guess he'd been hanging out with Joey.
别客气  兄弟012---You're welcome, buddy.
对  谢谢012---Yeah, thanks.
我有很多事要做  罗斯很好心012---I had a lot of work to do, and Ross, nice guy that he is,
主动说要帮忙012---offered to help me out.
我们边喝酒边聊天012---And then we had a little wine, we got to talking.
接下来罗斯突然就对我采取了主动012---And next thing you know, out of nowhere, Ross comes on to me.
这很容易让人误会012---That's a little misleading.
什么  你刚刚说的谎话012--- What is?  The lie you just told.
我说是你主动的  没错012--- That you came on to me?  There's the one!
但那是真的  老实一点吧012---But you did. Let's be honest.
没错  老实一点吧012---Yes, let's.
那不重要012---It's not important.
重要的是我们要生孩子了012---What's important is, we're having a baby,
谁先泡"随"并不重要012---and it doesn't matter who came on to who.
是"谁"才对012---"Whom."
没错012---That's right.
你先吻我的012---You know you kissed me first.
什么  是你求我吻你的012---What? You were begging to kiss you!
你处处给我发送暗号012---You were sending me signals all over the place!
我向你发暗号  对012--- I was sending signals?  Yeah.
谁觉得是我向罗斯012---Please. Okay. Anyone in this room think
发送乞求暗号的012---that I'd actually send Ross begging signals?
请举手012---Please, show of hands.
别人怎么想并不重要012---You know, it doesn't matter what people believe!
重要的是发生了什么012---What matters is what happened.
罗斯  跟我解释一下暗号的事012---Okay, so these signals, Ross, explain this to me,
或许我得小心一点012---'cause maybe I need to be more careful.
我正在发送讯号吗012---Am I sending these signals right now?
你知道吗  瑞秋  别纠结这个问题了012---You know what? You know what? Rachel, just drop it.
拜托告诉我  我是怎么求你的012---No, please. Show me how I begged you.
我可以证明  我都录在录影带里了012---I can show you! I have it on videotape.
那不过是一种表达方法012---It's an expression.
我不敢相信他录下他们做爱的经过012---I can't believe he taped the two of them having sex.
对  你录之前要先告诉对方才行012---Yeah. You gotta tell a girl before you tape her.
那是菜鸟才会犯的错误012---Such a rookie mistake.
你知道谁家有很棒的摄影机吗012---You know who has a great camera?
葛瑞格跟珍妮012---Greg and Jenny?
你还想打电话给他们吗012---Do you still want to call them?

问他们有没有买纪念品送给朋友012---Ask them if they brought their friends souvenirs.
喂  第八街外送餐厅012---Hello. 8th Street Deli?
快挂掉  光跟他们说话你就会食物中毒012---Hang up. You get food poisoning just talking to that place.
抱歉  打错了  来吧  宝贝012--- Sorry, wrong number.  Here you go, babe.
喂  又是外送餐厅012---Hello? It's the deli again!
好吧  我要吃三明治012---All right, I'll have a sandwich.
我觉得这个电话号码是错的012---I don't think this number's right.
怎么  你们拿到假电话了012--- What?  You got fakenumbered.
什么  没有人会那么做  我们会012--- What? People don't do that.  Oh, I think we do.
他们给了我们假号码012---They gave us a fake number?
他们为什么要那么做  我不知道012--- Why would they do that?  I don't know.
跟你聊天很开心012---You were a delight to talk to.
你问了一些很有见解的问题012---You asked all those insightful, great questions.
你也很风趣  一直在开玩笑012---And you've never been funnier. I mean, joke, joke, joke!
你真的很耍宝012---You were a hoot!
别担心了  你们还有我跟菲比012---Don't worry about it. You still got me and Phoebe.
对不起  我不要葛瑞格跟珍妮的退货012---Excuse me, I don't want Greg and Jenny's rejects.
瑞秋不肯跟我说话  她连门都不肯开012---Rachel won't talk to me. She won't open the door.
我很好奇是为什么  变态012---I wonder why, pervert.
好吧  我不是变态012---Okay, listen, I am not a pervert.
变态都是那么说的012---That's, like, the pervert motto.
举起你的右手  把左手插进裤子里012---Raise your right hand, put your left hand down your pants
再重复那句话012---and repeat that.
我不是故意要拍瑞秋012---Filming Rachel was not something I planned.
事情的经过是这样的  乔伊可以帮我作证012---Okay, look. Here's what happened. Joey can back me up on this.
还记得一个半月前  我跑去问你一个问题吗012---A month and a half ago, remember I came to you with a problem?
我的私人问题012---The personal thing?
什么私人间题  关于性的问题012--- What personal thing?  About sex?
我好几个月没有性生活了012---That I hadn't had sex in months?
我刚才就知道你的是哪件事012---Yeah, I knew what you were talking about.
你有空吗012---Do you have a minute?
我想谈一件我很难启齿的事012---I'd like to talk about something I'm uncomfortable talking about.
没问题012---Sure.
你跟你妈一起洗澡如何012---How about you showering with your mom?
我已经想好问题了012---I actually had a topic in mind.
我进入了干涸期012---I'm kind of going through a dry spell,
在性生活方面012---sexwise.
有好几个月了吗  五个月...012--- For, like, months?  Five, to be...
骗人的  是六个月012---...lying. Six.
六个月  那一定很难熬012---Six months? That's rough.
没有那么糟糕012---It's not all bad.
我学着去欣赏生活中的一些小事  譬如说012---I'm learning to appreciate the small things in life, like...
鸟的叫声跟天空的颜色012---...the sound of a bird and the color of the sky.
天空是蓝色的  罗斯  我昨天才做过爱012---The sky's blue, Ross. And I had sex yesterday.
拜托  帮帮我  我今晚有约会012---Please help me. I have a date tonight.
我得顺利达阵  我很担心自己的健康012---It has to go well. I'm scared for my health.
好的  好的012---Okay, okay.
我有个点子  我想出一个故事012---I got something. It's this story that I came up with.
非常浪漫  听到这个故事的女人都会心动012---Very romantic. I swear any woman that hears it is putty.
真的吗  说吧  好012--- Really? Tell it to me.  Okay.
你听完后定会想跟我上床012---Now, you're gonna want to have sex with me when you hear it.
记住  那只是一个故事012---Remember, it is just the story.
我会试着控制自己012---I'll try to control myself.
好012---Okay.
多年前  我在西欧自助旅行012---Years ago, I was backpacking across Western Europe...
你在西欧自助旅行012---You were backpacking across Western Europe?
你再干涸六个月去吧  罗斯012---Have a nice six more months, Ross.
好吧  抱歉  求求你012---Okay, okay. I'm sorry. Please, please.
你去了西欧  然后012---You were in Western Europe, and...?
我在巴塞罗那郊外012---I was just outside Barcelona,
在第比达包山脚下健行012---hiking in the foothills of Mount Tibidabo.
我走到小路的尽头012---I was at the end of this path,
来到一片林中空地  发现了一座湖012---and I came to a clearing and there was a lake.
它非常隐密  四周都是高大的树木012---Very secluded. There were tall trees all around.
那里非常安静  美极了012---It was dead silent. Gorgeous.
我看到在湖的对面012---And across the lake I saw
有个美女在洗澡012---a beautiful  woman bathing herself.
但她在哭012---But she was crying.
为什么012---Why?
酒真的很棒012---This is great wine.
是法国酒012---It's from France.
法国在欧洲012---In Europe.
就在西欧012---Western Europe.
几年前012---You know, a few years ago
我在西欧自助旅行012---I was backpacking across Western Europe.
真的吗  等一下  后面的故事更精彩012--- Really?  Wait, it gets better.
对  我在巴塞罗那012---Yeah, I was in Barcelona.
我在巴塞罗那念过一年书012---I studied for a year in Barcelona.
总之我在健行...012---So anyway, I was hiking...
我喜欢健行  那真的太棒了012--- I love hiking!  That's great!
我在第比达亚波山脚下健行...012---I was hiking along the foothills of Mount Tibidaybo...
我想是"第比达包山"才对012---I think it's "Tibidabo."
你想来讲这个故事吗012---Okay, do you want to tell the story?
你怎么来了  约会还顺利吗012---What are you doing here? How'd your date go?
太棒了 我正要过街去和她做爱012---Great. I'm across the street having sex right now.
你的故事烂透了012---Your story sucks.
如果不起作用  一定是你说的方法不对012---Look, if it didn't work, it's because you didn't tell it right.
告诉我你是怎么说的  不  我不想谈012--- Show me how you did it.  No, I don't want to.
你上次看到裸女是什么时候的事012---How long since you seen a girl naked?
我在西欧自助旅行012---I was backpacking across Western Europe...
我没有感觉012---I'm not feeling it.
我在巴塞罗那郊外健行012---I was outside Barcelona, hiking...
罗斯  我并没觉得欲火焚身  你呢012---No, Ross, I'm not hot. Are you hot?
我六个月没做爱  每天都欲火焚身012---It's been six months. I'm always hot.
你讲故事不够动人  你根本就不相信它012---You're not selling the story. You don't believe it.
我得走了  我有约会  但试试这招012---I gotta go, I got a date. But try this.
学我在试镜前做的那一招012---Do what I do when I'm preparing for an audition.
不  我帮你设置好录像机012---No. I'll set you up with my video camera
你可以自拍看看哪里做错了012---and you could record yourself and see what you're doing wrong.
我会试试看012---I'll try that.
已经设定好了  可以拍了012---Alright, now, you're all set up. You're good to go.
按下录影键就可以了  祝你好运 谢谢012--- Just hit record.  Good luck. Thanks.
乔伊  如果你跟女人约会出了问题012---Hey, Jo, listen. If you ever have any problem with the ladies,
我可以帮你012---you know I'll help you out.
那对我来说意义重大012---That means a lot to me, man.
你好啊012---Hello.
需要我帮你效劳吗  要擦镜头吗012---Can I get you anything? Lens cleaner?
电池还有电吗012---Your battery okay?
罗斯  谢天谢地你在这里  快帮帮我012---Ross, thank God you're here. You have to help me.
你在自言自语吗012---Were you talking to yourself?
那样说会比较不丢脸  对  没错012---That's less embarrassing. Yes. Yes, I was.
她一走进来  我一分心012---So when she came in, I got distracted
就完全忘记了录影机的事012---and totally forgot about the camera.
录影机拍录下了整个经过012---It kept rolling and recorded everything.
我们得看看那卷录影带012---Yeah, we're gonna need to see that tape.
真是个好主意  那会让瑞秋原谅我012---What a great idea! That'll get Rachel to forgive me.
那对她来说不公平  忘了录影带的事吧012---You know what? It's not fair to her. Let's forget the tape.
谢谢012---Thank you.
不行  你说得对012--- No.  You're right.
乔伊  不行  我了解012--- Joey, no.  Loud and clear.
我不明白为什么葛瑞格和珍妮012---I still don't get why Greg and Jenny
要给我们假的电话号码012---would give us a fake number.
如果他们是这方面的老手012---You know, if they knew what they were doing,
甚至都不会给你们真名012---they probably didn't give you real names, either.
或许有人会给假电话号码012---Maybe people give out fake numbers,
但没有人会给假名012---but they don't give out fake names.
是吗  嗨  肯·亚当斯很高兴能认识你012---Oh, yeah? Hi. Ken Adams. Nice to meet you.
瑞吉娜·费兰吉012---Regina Phalange.
真不懂  我们没做错事  就是嘛012--- I just don't get it. We didn't do anything wrong.  I know.
虽然你说了很多冷笑话012---Although you did tell an awful lot of jokes.
你说很好笑啊  快讲笑话吧012---You said they were funny. Joke, joke, joke!
讲笑话...012---Joke, joke...
可能是你问了太多问题害的012---Or maybe it was your questions.
我的问题怎么了012---What about my questions?
你问了太多问题012---The sheer volume.
像是跟谜题王坐在一起012---It was like flying with the Riddler.
你又在讲笑话吗  你又在问问题吗012--- I'm soory. Was that another joke?  Was that another question?
罗斯还在吗012---Is Ross still here?
他走了  但他告诉我们发生了什么事012---No, Rach, he's gone, but, listen, he told us what happened.
听起来真的是个误会012---It does sound like an honest mistake.
是吗  如果我把我跟你做爱的过程录下来012---Really? How would you like it if I had sex with you
你会有什么感觉呢012---and I taped it?
算了吧012---Oh, forget it.
他来了  我孩子他爹012---There he is, the father of my child,
西村的黄片之王012---the porn king of the West Village.
那是个意外  行吗012---Look, it was an accident, okay?
我觉得很内疚  我发誓我还没有看过它012---I feel bad that happened, but I swear, I didn't even watch it.
总之  拿去吧012---Anyway, here.
或许亲手毁了它  你会觉得舒服一点012---I thought you might be more comfortable destroying it yourself.
谢谢012---Thank you.
什么012---What?
你们不想看这玩意吧  我们当然想012--- You don't want to see this, do you?  Hell, yeah!
我不会让你们看这个012---I am not gonna show you this.
我们不是要看性爱镜头012---Not the sex part.
只是想看你们怎么开始的012---Just the stuff leading up to it.
算了  让她毁掉吧012---Forget it. She's destroying it.
我们会想其他办法012---Okay, fine, fine. We'll think of another way
解决"谁先主动"的问题012---to put the "who came on to who" thing to rest.
快想012---Come on now, think!
别想这事了  菲比  那是瑞秋的录影带012---Forget it, Phoebe, okay? It's Rachel's tape,
她想怎么处置它是她的自由012---and she can do whatever she wants with it.
她想毁了它  别说了012---And she wants to destroy it, so end of story.
我想看  什么012--- I want to see it.  What?
你显然不希望大家看这盘录影带012---Clearly, you don't want people to see this tape.
我也不想让大家看012---I don't want people to see this tape, either.
但你非常不希望我们看012---But you so badly don't want us to see it
让我想要看个究竞  明白吗012---that it makes me want to see it. Do you see?
我们到底要不要看录影带012---Are we watching the tape or not?
我不让别人看是为了保护你012---I don't want people to see it for your sake.
我不相信你012---I don't believe you.
我想你不希望他们看到你求我012---I think you don't want them to see you begging me.
瑞秋  求你了  这算是预告部份012--- Rachel, please?  Oh, a little preview.
好吧  我要这卷录影带证明012---Fine. Fine. But I want the record to show
我是想保护你012---that I tried to take the high road.
因为再过五分钟我会说...012---Because in about five minutes, I'm gonna be saying...
好吧  要开始了012---Okay, here we go.
你好啊  需要我帮你效劳吗012---Hello. Can I get you anything?
我好开心012---I'm so happy.
谢天谢地你在这里  罗斯  快帮帮我012---Thank God you're here, Ross. Help me.
你在自言自语吗012---Were you talking to yourself?
我出现了  你就要怀孕了012--- There I am.  You're gonna get pregnant.
我搞砸了012---I screwed up so bad.
好几个星期前我告诉莫妮卡012---I told Monica that I'd send
我会把喜帖寄出去012---all those wedding invitations weeks ago.
你没有寄012---You didn't do it?
我把它们放在办公桌上  直到今天才想起来012---I put them in my desk at work, and forgot about them until today.
亲爱的  没关系的012---Sweetie, it's okay.
客人都来了  我没事的012---Everybody made it to the wedding. I'm fine.
但你把我的手弄痛了  我知道012--- Kind of hurting my hand though.  I know.
我竟然会做出这种事012---I can't believe I did this,
何况莫妮卡每天都在嘱咐我这件事012---especially after Monica went on and on and on about it.
喜帖在这里  瑞秋  小心点  瑞秋012---"Okay, Rachel. Here are the invitations, Rachel. Be very careful, Rachel.
拜托  别在喜帖附近喝东西  瑞秋012---Please, drinking no liquids around the invitations, Rachel."
你们在我们的喜帖上面做爱了吗012---Did you do it on our invitations?
我们没在寄出去的喜帖上做012---Not on the ones we sent out.
你们在我们裱起来的喜帖上面做爱了012---So just the ones you gave back to us and we had framed?
一切都发生得太快了012---Can you believe it's already happening?
感觉上他们像是昨天才订婚012---It seems like yesterday they just got engaged.
我知道012---I know.
还记得他们订婚那一晚吗012---Remember that night they got engaged?
你跟我差一点...012---How you and I almost...
我记得我们差一点就做了012---Oh, I remember how we almost.
你觉得我们当时真的会做吗012---You think we would've gone through with it?
如果没被逮到的话012---If we haven't gotten caught.
你觉得我们会做吗012---You think we would have done it?
我知道我想做  但我不知道你想不想012---I know I wanted to. I just wasn't sure if you wanted to.
我也想012---Oh, I wanted to.
那么我们两个都想012---So we both wanted to.
有意思012---Interesting.
总之012---Anyway,
这样的结果或许是最好的012---it probably worked out for the best.
没错012---Yeah, sure.
再过十秒他就要吻我了012---In about 10 seconds, he kisses me.
再过五秒你们就会知道为什么012---In about 5 seconds, you'll see why.
我有没有跟你说过012---Ross, did I ever tell you about the time
我到西欧自助旅行的事012---that I went backpacked through Western Europe?
准备看她求我吧012---Get ready to see some begging.
是你对罗斯主动的012---Oh, you came on to Ross!
什么012---What?
现在我好开心012---Now I'm so happy.
你这是什么意思  你用了欧洲的故事012--- What are you talking about?  You used the Europe story!
那是你想做爱时会用的魔法故事012---That's the magic story you use when you want to have sex!
你怎么知道那个故事012---How do you know about that story?
你怎么知道那个故事012---How do you know about that story?
是一个家伙告诉我朋友艾琳的012---My friend Irene heard it from some guy.
就是我012---Some guy!
不  她说那个家伙叫做肯·亚当斯012---No, she told me that his name was Ken Adams.
我就是肯·亚当斯012---Ken Adams!
看来大家都知道欧洲的故事012---So, people are familiar with the Europe story?
关于"谁主动"的问题012---Yeah. Listen. About that, the "who came on to who" thing
真的不重要012---really doesn't matter.
反正该发生的总会发生012---I mean, it would have happened either way.
就算你不主动  我也会主动012---If you had't initiated it, I know I would have.
那是个神奇的夜晚012---It was an amazing night.
没错  确实很神奇012---It was. It was an amazing night.
你觉得它看起来也很神奇吗012---You think it looked amazing?
我不知道012---I don't know.
我真的没看012---I mean, I honestly didn't watch it.
是  我也没看012---Yeah, me neither.
还没看012---Yet.
看的话应该会很奇怪012---That may be weird.
对  会很奇怪012---Yeah, it would be really weird.
祝你好运  祝你好运012--- Good luck.  Good luck to you.
我可以消音吗  麻烦你了012--- Mind if I mute?  Oh, please.
我们开始脱衣服了012---There go the clothes.
你脱衣服的速度真快012---You are undressing awfully quickly.
我六个月没做了  瑞秋012---Six months, Rachel. Six months.
我们看起来很不错  我也那么觉得012--- We look pretty good.  I was gonna say.
你皮肤晒得很漂亮  谢谢012--- Nice tan.  Thank you.
那个周末我才去过海边012---I'd just gone to the beach that weekend.
你有在健身吗012---Have you been working out?
我一直在健身012---I have been working out.
这比我之前的经验要好得多...012---This is so much better than I ever...
那可不太雅观012---Oh, that's not pretty.
快点关掉  不012--- Make it stop. Make it stop.  Oh, no!
喂  葛瑞格吗012---Hello, Greg?
我是飞机上跟你们见过面的莫妮卡012---Hi, this is Monica from the plane.
听着  你给我的电话号码  853...012---Listen, the number that you gave me, 853...
那是他们的旧号码012---That is their old number.
他们搬家之后  珍妮老是给别人他们的旧号码012---Jenny's been giving it out since they moved!
那真像珍妮的作风012---Jenny! That is so Jenny!
你们下星期六能跟我们一起去玩吗012---Listen. How would you like to get together next Saturday?
好吧  星期天呢012---Okay, how about Sunday?
下星期呢012---Okay, the week after that?
下下星期呢012---The week after that?
你知道吗012---You know what, Greg?
我们幽默风趣012---We are good, interesting,
善于提问012---funny people with good questions.
如果你跟你的宝贝珍妮没发现...012---And if you and your precious Jenny can't see that, then...
一月十五日012---January 15?
到时候见012---We'll see you then! Okay.
这是三分熟  这是五分熟  快去上菜012---This one's rare. This one's mediumwell. Go, go, go!
菲比  晚餐好吃吗012---Hey, Phoebe! How was dinner?!
晚餐很好吃  我只是来打招呼  我要走了012---Dinner was good! Just saying hi! Now I'm gonna go!
你好啊012---Well, hello there.
我在菜单上没看到这道美味012---I didn't see this on the menu.
提姆  她是菲比012---Tim, this is Phoebe.
菲比  他是新来的副厨师长提姆012---Phoebe, this is Tim, my new sous chef.
你是莫妮卡的老板  不  她是我的老板012--- So you're Monica's boss?  No, she's my boss.
"副"在法文里是"之下"的意思012---"Sous" is French for "under."
我副（明）白了012---I "sousstand."
提姆  我要一份乌贼跟一份凯撒沙拉012---Tim, I need a calamari and a caesar salad.
你可以把青酱递给我吗012---And could you get me the pesto?
青酱是你做的吗  没错012--- You made pesto?  Yes, I did.
你觉得你的青酱是最"棒"的吗012---Would you say your pesto is the besto?
我不知道  我会说它真的很"强"012---I don't know. I would say it's pretty goodo.
别忘了给我拿乌贼跟沙拉012---I still need the calamari and salad.
我喜欢你的项链012---I like your necklace.
这是我自己做的  你真的好有天份012--- I made it myself.  You are so talented.
还是不够"酱"012---Well, it's no pesto.
我们就别兜圈子了012---Alright, alright. Let's just cut to the chase.
你是单身  你也单身012---Okay. You're single. You're single.
他11点下班  她会等你的电话012---He gets off work at 11. She'll be waiting for your call.
我会把你的电话号码给他012---I'll give him your number if I could just get
只要你给我乌贼跟凯撒沙拉012---one calamari and one caesar salad!
我没有大叫  我不必被罚一块钱012---I did not yell. I am not putting a dollar in the jar.
《老友记》  第八季  第5集  瑞秋的约会012---Friends S08E05 The One With Rachel's Date
宾  你还在熬夜加班012---Wow, Bing! Burning the midnight oil.
你很了解我的  老板012---You know me, sir.
我正好有个问题问你012---I do have a question for you.
你知道要怎么避开公司的电脑网路012---Do you know how I can get around the office computer network...
看劲爆火辣的国际黄片吗012---...so I can access the really good Internet porn?
你真爱开玩笑  宾012---You're a joker, Bing.
那有什么好笑的012---What's funny about that?
抱歉让你等这么久012---Sorry I kept you waiting so long.
没关系  你想去哪里012---That's okay. Where do you wanna go?
我以为你知道我要去哪里012---I think you know where I wanna go.
硬石餐厅  对012--- The Hard Rock Cafe?  Yeah.
又要去  对012--- Again?  Yeah.
我真的很喜欢那里的食物012---I'm telling you, I like the food.
你是喜欢那里的紫雨展示品012---You like the Purple Rain display.
巴伯  托比  祝你今晚玩得开心012--- Hey, Bob.  Hey, Toby. Have a good night.
那家伙叫你托比012---Did that guy just call you Toby?
对  他以为那是我的名字012---Yeah, he thinks that's my name.
你为什么不更正他012---Why don't you correct him?
现在纠正有点太晚了012---It's been going on way too long now.
他第一次这么叫我  我们只是在走廊擦肩而过012---The first time he said it, we were just passing each other in the hallway,
所以我什么都没说012---so I didn't say anything.
第二次他说"托比  你要吃甜甜圈吗"012---The next time he said, "Hey, Toby, want a doughnut?"
我确实想吃甜甜圈012---I wanted the doughnut.
五年后甜甜圈早就消化光了 我还是托比012---Five years later, the doughnut's gone and I'm still Toby.
五年了  钱德勒  你得告诉他012---Five years. Chandler, you have to tell him.
不行  那多尴尬啊012---No. That would be so awkward.
再说  我们不在同一个楼层工作  他在六楼012---Besides, we don't work together. He's on the sixth floor.
他只是偶尔才会叫我一次托比  没什么012---So he calls me Toby once in a while. What's the big deal?
这已经算不错了  反正他不是叫我妙丽012---It could be worse. It's not like he's calling me Muriel.
妙丽  他为什么要叫你妙丽012---Muriel. Why would he call you Muriel?
天啊012---Oh, my God.
钱德勒·M·宾012---Chandler "M." Bing.
那不仅是个M  你的中间名是妙丽012---It's not just an "M." Your middle name is Muriel!
那是家族名字012---It is a family name.
钱德勒·妙丽·宾012---Chandler Muriel Bing.
你父母真是完全不给你留活路  对吧012---Your parents never even gave you a chance, did they?
德瑞克  我找出你丧失记忆的原因了012---Drake, I've discovered the reason for your memory loss.
为什么012---What is it?
你的脑部移植手术并未完全成功012---Apparently your brain transplant was not entirely successful.
你的身体在排斥洁西卡的脑部012---It seems your body's rejecting Jessica's brain.
很严重吗012---Is it serious?
如果我们可以从捐赠者的身体抽取组织...012---Not if we extract tissue from the original body...
合成抗体  将其导入你体内012---...and synthesize antibodies and introduce them to your system
以此来解除排异效应012---which could stop you from rejecting the brain.
听起来很简单  我们就按你说的做吧012---That sounds simple enough. Let's just do that.
我们可以那么做012---We would,
但我们想挖出洁西卡的尸体时012---but when we went to exhume Jessica's body...
发现它不见了012---...it was gone.
卡012---Cut.
非常不错  大伙们012---Very nice, people.
我换好衣服后  我们就可以去吃晚餐了012---Okay, let me just get changed and we can go to dinner.
洁西卡的尸体怎么了012---What happened to Jessica's body?
我不能剧透  你得看电视才会知道012---I'm not telling you. You'll have to see it on TV.
你不知道  对吧  对  我也不在乎012--- You don't know, do you?  No. couldn't care less.
你表现得很好  你也是012--- Good scene, man.  You too.
怎么  你根本不是演员012---What? You weren't in it.
凯许  她是我朋友瑞秋012---Kash, this is my friend Rachel.
二位互相认识一下012---Rachel, Kash. Kash, Rachel.
为什么之前我没有见过你012---Why haven't I seen you here before?
乔伊觉得我会丢他的脸012---Joey just thinks I'll embarrass him.
他认为我是肥皂剧脑残粉012---He thinks I'm a soap opera nut.
我才不是  真的012---Which I'm not. I'm not.
虽然我的确知道012---Although, I do know
你最喜欢胡桃奶油口味的冰淇淋012---your favorite ice cream flavor is butter pecan.
你的狗叫华利012---And your dog's name is Wally.
天啊  我在摸你的胳膊  我们走吧012--- Look, I'm just stroking your arm.  Here we go. Here we go.
再见  凯许  再见012--- Bye, Kash.  Bye.
帮我跟华利问好012---Say hi to Wally.
莫妮卡012---Monica.
昨晚我跟提姆玩得很开心012---Oh, my god. I had the best time with Tim last night.
他真的很体贴012---He is so sweet.
我等不及钻到他的身体"下"面去012---I can't wait to get "sousneath" him.
我得开除他  为什么012--- I have to fire him.  Why?
他很不称职  动作超慢  还会把食物烧焦012---He's terrible. He's slow. He burns things.
昨晚他还把我的甜点主厨烧着了012---Last night he lit my pastry chef on fire.
他可能是太紧张了  你老是凶巴巴的012---Maybe he was just nervous. You can be intimidating.
我见过你的甜点主厨012---Besides,  I've met your pastry chef,
她牛哄哄的  也该灭灭她的威风了012---and she can stand to be taken down a peg or two.
现在她没有眉毛了  任务完成012---Well, now she has no eyebrows. Mission accomplished.
莫妮卡  他热爱他的工作012---But, Monica, he loves his job so much.
你不能再给他一次机会吗  拜托012---Can't you just give him another chance, please?
好吧  但如果他再放火烧别人  他非走不可012---All right. But if he lights someone else on fire, he's out of there.
那很公平  谢谢你012---That's fair. Thank you so much. Thanks.
看起来他烧甜点主厨的时候012---Oops. Looks like when he got the pastry chef,
也烧到你了012---he got you a little bit too.
我这是花钱去做的头发012---I paid to have this done.
我喜欢012---Love it!
知道吗  凯许真的喜欢你012---Hey. You know, Kash really liked you the other day.
他觉得你很迷人012---He said he thought you were charming.
我以为自己蠢到家了  我站在你这边012--- I thought I was a complete idiot.  I'm with you.
他还问我你会不会愿意跟他约会012---He even asked me if I thought you'd go out with him.
我感觉快要吐了012---I think I'm gonna throw up a little.
你怎么说  我说不会012--- What did you say?  I said, "No."
什么012---What?
我觉得既然你怀孕了012---What? I just figured since you're pregnant,
就不会跟别人约会了012---you're not gonna be seeing people.
乔伊012---Okay, Joey.
首先  他是凯许·福特  不是一般人012---First of all, Kash Ford? Not people.
其次  你告诉他我怀孕了  他说了什么012---Second of all, what did he say when you told him I was pregnant?
我没告诉他  我不确定你要不要告诉别人012---I didn't tell him. I didn't know if you're telling people.
那时候我以为凯许只是"一般人"012---This back when I thought Kash was still "people."
很好  别告诉他012---Good, good. Don't tell him. Don't tell him.
让他打电话给我012---Just have him call me, okay?
瑞秋  我觉得这样不...012---Rach, look. I really don't think that's such a great...
照我的话做  不然我会回到摄影棚012---Okay. You go do it or I'll come back to that set.
泡其他的男演员  一个都不放过012---I'll meet more actors. I'll meet them all.
巴伯  我朋友托比今天还好吗012--- Hey, Bob.  How's my pal Toby doing today?
我看到他时会帮你问一下012---If I see him, I'll ask.
你刚刚在跟六楼的巴伯说话吗012---Was that Bob from six you were just talking to?
对  你们互相认识012--- Yeah.  Then you know each other?
我们知道彼此的名字而已012---We're on a semifirstname basis.
如果他加入我们的团队呢  巴伯吗012--- What do you think of adding him to our team?  Bob?
每天跟我们在这里一起工作012---Working here with us? Every day?
我不知道他有没有那个能耐012---Yeah. I don't know if he has what it takes.
是吗  六楼的人很喜欢他012---Really? They love him down on six.
但这里是11楼012---But this is 11.
这里的工作要难上两倍012---It's almost twice as hard up here.
好吧  我明白你的意思了012---Okay, I hear you loud and clear.
巴伯还是不能调职  我想那样最好012--- Bob will stay put.  I think it's best, sir.
但我们真的急需新鲜血液012---But we really do need to find someone up here.
工作开始越积越多了012---Work is starting to pile up.
我桌上的文件已经叠到这么高了012---I've got a stack of documents on my desk this high.
我给你出个主意  把它们丢到碎纸机里012---You know what we should do. Just toss them in the shredder
就说你从来没有收到它们012---and claim you never got them.
那真的很好笑  宾012---That's a good one, Bing.
我该怎么做他们才会觉得我是认真的012---What does a guy have to do to be taken seriously around here?
我又给了他一次机会  但提姆非走不可012---Okay, I gave him another chance, but Tim has got to go.
但...  不行  他太不称职了012--- But...  No, no, no. He is totally incompetent.
我打电话给推荐他给我的厨师012---I called the chef who recommended him to me.
他说"哈哈  整到你了"012---He said, "Ha, ha! Gotcha!"
但别今天开除他  为什么012--- Okay, okay. But you can't fire him today.  Why not?
因为今天我要甩掉他012---Because I'm dumping him today.
什么  你说他很体贴012---What? You said he was so sweet.
他确实体贴  但也太体贴了012---He is sweet. He's too sweet.
老是打电话给我012---He calls me all the time.
"你平安回家了吗012---"Did you get home from work okay?
你洗澡没出事吧"012---Did you get out of the shower okay?"
别接电话不就得了  那他会亲自过来012--- Just don't pick up your phone.  Then he comes over!
"我好担心你"  有点男子气概吧012---"I was so worried about you." Be a man!
所以现在我不能开除他012---So now I'm not allowed to fire him?
我们不能让他在同一天既失业又失恋012---We can't fire him and dump him on the same day.
他会自杀的012---He'll kill himself.
那我今天开除他012---Okay, well then, I'll fire him today,
你再跟他交往一星期012---and you go out with him another week.
你开什么玩笑  再跟他交往一个星期012---Are you kidding? Another week with that simp,
我会自杀的012---I'll kill myself.
我们都在今天跟他摊牌  让他自己想办法应付012---Okay, then we'll both do it today and he'll just have to deal with it.
好吧  但问题是谁要先说呢012---Okay. But the question is who's gonna go first?
后说的就是贱人012---Whoever goes second is the bitch.
什么意思  开除刚失恋的员工012--- What do you mean?   Come on, fire a guy that's just been dumped?
贱人  甩掉刚失业的恋人012---Bitch! And dump a guy that's just been fired?
金发贱人012---Blond bitch!
我几天前就想开除他  所以应该让我先说012---I wanted to do this days ago, so I think I should go first.
好吧  你说得有理012---All right, that makes sense.
去你的  我要先说012---But screw you! I'm going first!
托比  你有空吗  当然  什么事012--- Toby, you got a sec?  Sure. What's up?
我们刚开完会012---I just had a meeting.
我本想被调职到这里来012---I was actually hoping to get transferred up here,
但刚发现我的美梦破灭了012---but I just found out it's not gonna happen.
很明显有人认为我不是"11楼的材料"012---Apparently somebody thinks I'm not "11 thfloor material."
钱德勒到底是谁012---Say, who the hell is this Chandler?
今晚约会时哪个藉口012---What do you think is a better excuse
最适合我用来挡酒012---for why I'm not drinking on this date tonight?
"我正在戒酒"  "我是摩门教徒"012---"I'm a recovering alcoholic," "I'm a Mormon"...
或是"我昨晚喝太醉现在还在宿醉"012---...or "I got so hammered last night I'm still a little drunk"?
今晚你要做什么012---So, what do you want to do tonight?
安杰丽卡有部很棒的乌克兰电影上映012---There’s a Ukrainian film at the Angelica
听说很震撼人心  你想看吗012---that's supposed to be very powerful. Interested?
没兴趣012---No. No.
但我可以陪你看一般人看的电影012---But I'll go see a normalperson movie with you.
瑞秋  你要一起来吗012---Rach, you wanna come?
不行  我有约会012---Oh, no. I can't. I've got a date.
约会  对  怎么了  很奇怪吗012--- A date?  Yeah. Why, is that weird for you?
不  一点都不奇怪  那很正常012---Why, no. It's the opposite of weird. It's regular.
太普通了  事实上还有点无聊012---It's mundane. It's actually a little dull.
它可不是乌克兰电影012---It's no Ukrainian film.
耳环012---Earrings!
她有约会  对象是谁012---A date? She's got a date? With who?
我撮合她跟一个男演员012---I set her up with this actor on my show.
是你帮她牵的红线  不是012--- You set her up?  No.
乔伊  你在想什么012---Joey, what were you thinking?
我觉得应该没关系012---I was thinking that it would probably be okay...
因为你们两个已经分手五年了012---because Ross hasn’t gone out with Rachel in five years!
乔伊  我担心不是她  而是我的宝宝012---Joey, I'm not worried about her! I'm worried about my baby.
跟她约会的人  也在跟我的宝宝约会012---Whoever she dates, my baby dates.
这个"男演员"要带她去哪里012---Where is this "actor" taking them?
我也是"男演员"012---Hey! I'm an "actor" too.
他们大概要搭渡轮012---I'm not sure. I think they're taking the ferry
到史坦顿岛玩012---out to some Italian place on Staten Island.
渡轮  我的宝宝要搭渡轮012---A ferry? My baby's going on a ferry?
你知道那有多危险吗012---Do you have any idea how dangerous those are?
渡轮是指那种载车的012---Are we talking about one of those big boats
速度缓慢的大船吧012---that carry cars that go like five miles an hour?
他们为什么不去跳飞机  那多有意思012---Why not just jump out of an airplane. Thatthat's a fun date!
或点火柴把彼此烧了  也很有意思012---or burn each other with matches? That's fun, too.
乔伊  凯许  罗斯  他就是凯许012--- Hey, Joey.  Hey, Kash. This is Ross. Ross, this is Kash.
我听说今晚你们要去搭渡轮012---Hey, I hear you're going on a ferry tonight.
你挺大胆啊012---Bit of a daredevil, are we?
这件裙子是不是太露了  嗨   凯许012---Do you guys think this is too slutty? Hi, Kash.
瑞秋  你准备好了吗012---Hey, Rachel. You ready to go?
是的  待会见  好012--- Yeah. See you guys later.  Okay.
祝你们玩的愉快  谢谢012--- Have a great time, you guys.  Thank you.
那件裙子的确太露了012---And yes, it is too slutty!
我很高兴你打电话给我012---I'm so glad you called.
感觉之前一直是我打给你012---I feel like it's always me calling you.
什么事  菲比没事吧012---So, what's up? Is everything okay with Phoebe?
我待会就会没事012---It will be in a minute. Listen.
提姆  你真的很棒012---Tim, you're a really great guy.
那是因为我跟你在一起012---That's because I'm with you.
但我的人生现在走到了...012---It's just, I'm in a place in my life right now where...
抱歉  "刚刚有消息传过来"012---So sorry. "This just in."
是餐厅有急事呼我  莫妮卡要我马上赶过去012---Oh, it's 911 from the restaurant, that means Monica needs me right away.
不是的  我知道发生了什么事012---No, she doesn't! I know what that is.
你可以留下来012---You can stay.
我也会想你的  菲比012---I'll miss you too, Pheebs.
我会把你放在这里012---And I will be holding you right here.
你想看哪部电影012---So, what movie do you wanna see?
我不想看那种得认真看字幕的电影012---And not one I have to read, okay?
我受够看书了012---I get that from books.
书  好吧  汽车杂志  玉米片包装012--- Books?  Alright, car magazines, cereal boxes...
但那就够我受的了012---...but it's enough!
我们别去看电影了012---I tell you what. Why don't we just stay here?
就待在家里玩吧012---Let's not see a movie, we'll just and hang.
你要等瑞秋约会回来吗012---Just wait for Rachel to come back from her date?
如果你想那么做的话  我不会反对012---Hey, if that's what you wanna do, I'm not gonna say no.
哥们  你这是怎么了012---Dude, what is going on?
我得知道他们约会进行得怎样  为什么012--- I have to find out how it went.  Why?
他可能是我孩子的继父012---This guy could be my baby's stepfather.
才约会一次  你就担心他们要结婚了012---They go on one date and you're worried about them getting married?!
他又不是你012---He's not you!
我不敢相信她去约会了012---I just... I can't believe she's dating!
罗斯  你觉得她该怎么做呢012---Ross, what did you think she was gonna do?
我不知道012---I don't know.
我不敢相信会发生这种事012---I guess I just can't believe any of this is happening.
你是什么意思012---What do you mean?
我以为我再生个孩子012---It's just I always thought when I had another kid,
情况会不一样012---it'd be different.
我爱本012---I love Ben.
但每次送他到卡罗尔跟苏珊家012---But every time  I drop him off at Carol and Susan's...
我都会觉得很伤心012---...it breaks my heart a little.
我一直想像着  我跟未来的太太周末躺在床上012---I've always had this picture of me and my next wife in bed on Sunday,
我的孩子跑过来跳到床上012---my kid comes running in, leaps up on the bed
我们会一起看报纸012---and we all read the paper together, you know?
或许还会抢着看科学版012---Maybe fight over the science section.
很棒啊  你现在还是有机会过那样的生活012---That's a nice picture. You can still have that.
不  瑞秋跟别的男人约会去了012---No. No, I can't. Rachel's out with some guy.
我的孩子跟她一起去了012---My baby went with her.
那个梦想只会离我越来越远了012---If anything, that picture keeps moving further away.
我能问你一件事吗012---Hey, can I ask you something?
你想像你未来太太的时候012---In this picture of you and your wife,
她是瑞秋吗012---is your wife Rachel?
以前是的012---It used to be.
现在我梦里的人没有具体的相貌012---Now she doesn't really have a face.
但她的身材超火辣012---Smokin body, though.
说得好  但是罗斯  她已经不是瑞秋了012---Good call. But the face, Ross, the face isn't Rachel.
对  但如果是的话  事情会简单很多吧012---No. But how much easier would it be if it were?
我懂  但那不是她要的生活012---Yeah, I know, but I don't think that's not what she wants.
那也不是我想要的生活012---No, it's not what I want either.
我不能逼自己再爱上她012---I mean II can't force myself to fall in love with her again now.
罗斯  或许你需要新的展望012---Okay, Ross, maybe you need a new picture, okay?
它会跟你之前的梦想不一样012---It won't be what you thought.
但不论如何...012---But no matter what...
你都将迎来一个新的生命  你的孩子012---...there's gonna be a brandnew little baby. Your baby.
谁在乎梦想是什么样的呢012---Who cares what the picture looks like?
对012---Yeah.
我们一起出去找点乐子吧012---I tell you what. Let's you and me go out and have some fun.
你想做什么都行  来吧012---Whatever you want. Come on.
我们还赶得上看乌克兰电影012---We can catch that Ukrainian film.
不  我说找乐子012---No, I said fun.
嘿  托比  嘿  巴比012--- Hey, Toby?  Hey, Bobby.
事实上是巴伯012---It's Bob, actually.
你在这里工作  钱德勒·宾的办公室在哪里012---You work up here. Can you tell me where this Chandler Bing's office is?
就在...012---Yeah, it's right...
就在那里  你问这个做什么012---Right there. Let me ask you, why?
我想找那个混蛋谈谈012---I wanna talk to that bastard,
看他跟我有什么过节012---See what his problem is.
好吧  巴伯  听我说012---Okay, Bob. Listen.
是我害你无法调职012---I'm the reason you didn't get the job up here.
托比  不要  巴伯012--- Toby, don't.  Bob.
托比  别替他背黑锅了012---Toby, I'm not gonna let you cover for him.
你说任何话只会让我更气钱德勒012---Anything you say will just get me more upset with Chandler.
那还真是让我进退两难012---That puts me in a difficult position.
我收到你的寻呼了  没事吧012---I got your page. Is everything okay?
那得视情况而定012---That depends.
你跟菲比还好吧012---How are you and Phoebe?
很好  谢谢你介绍我们认识012---Oh it's great! It's great! Thank you so much for introducing us!
这是我的荣幸012---My pleasure.
好吧  我得跟你宣布一个坏消息012---Okay, I'm afraid I've got some bad news.
菲比  莫妮卡012--- Phoebe!  Monica!
你被开除了  我要跟你分手012--- You're fired!  I'm breaking up with you!
什么012---What?
我要跟你分手012---I'm breaking up with you.
你被开除了  为什么012--- You're fired.  Why?
抱歉  我还没有准备好跟别人长期交住012---I'm sorry. I'm not ready for a relationship right now.
我也很抱歉  但我喜欢凡事照我的方法来做012---I'm sorry too. But I like things done a certain way.
我们之间的化学反应不对012---The chemistry's just not right.
这个理由很好  我们也是一样012---Oh that's good, the chemistry thing for us too.
好吧012---Wow. Okay.
我知道我大黏人了012---I realize I came on a little strong,
那是因为我觉得你很棒012---but it's because I think you're so amazing.
我要告诉你012---I just wanna tell you how much
我很感激你给我这个机会012---I appreciate you giving me an opportunity here.
你是我合作过最有天份的厨师012---because you're the most talented chef I've ever worked for.
总之...012---Anyway...
提姆  等一下  什么事012--- Tim, wait.  Yeah?
我话说得太快了  这份工作需要时间学习012---I think I spoke too quickly. There's a learning curve with this job.
或许我们可以再试一次012---And maybe we could try it again.
真的吗  是的012--- Really?  Yeah.
谢谢  我知道我可以表现得更好  好012--- Thank you so much. I know I can be better.  Okay.
提姆  我只想说祝你好运012---And, Tim, I just want to say good luck here.
你好  嗨012--- Hello.  Hi.
你约会情况如何012---How was the date?
我现在孤身一人  还买了15块钱的糖果012---I'm alone and I just bought $ 15 wonth of candy bars.
你觉得呢012---What do you think?
发生了什么事012---What happened?
我不知深浅地告诉他我怀孕了012---I made the mistake of telling him I was pregnant.
他不能接受吗  他的反应比你强012--- He didn't take it so well?  Well, better than you.
但那还不是我想要的反应012---But still not what you want.
对  他变得举止怪异  语无伦次012---Yeah. He got all weird and sputtery.
然后他说"我听说长痔疮很烦人的"012---Then he said: "I hear those hemorrhoids are a bitch."
他听着很镇静  是吧012--- He sounds swell.  Doesn't he?
我给你讲点好笑的事情吧  好啊012--- You want a little cheering up?  Yeah.
坐下  好012--- Sit down.  Okay.
你猜谁的中间名叫妙丽012---Guess whose middle name is Muriel.
钱德勒·M·宾  天啊012---Chandler M. Bing. Oh, my God.
我很遗憾你的约会没有成功  没事的012--- I'm sorry about your date.  It's all right.
我猜我受够了约会012---I guess I'm just done with the whole dating thing.
那只是我生命中另一个翻天覆地的变化012---Just one more thing in my life that's suddenly completely different.
这真的很难  我了解012--- This is hard.  Yeah, I know.
但反过来说012---On the other hand,
再过七个月你就要拥有一个宝宝了012---in about seven months you're gonna have something...
你对他的爱012---...that you're gonna love
胜于你对任何约会对象的感觉012---more than any guy you've ever gone out with.
等着吧012---Just wait.
等到孩子第一次抓住你的手指012---Wait until the first time your baby grabs your finger.
那种感觉妙极了012---You have no idea.
谢谢你  亲爱的012---Thanks, sweetie.
你要喝杯咖啡吗012---You wanna grab some coffee?
不  我要回家吃掉10根棒棒糖012---No. I'm gonna go eat 10 candy bars.
我还以为我让你心情变好了012---I thought I cheered you up.
没错  我一共买了20根呢  是啊012--- You did. There are 20 in here.  Right.
晚安  晚安012--- Good night.  Good night.
罗斯  是我012--- Ross?  Yeah?
我是蒙娜  我们在婚礼上见过012---Hey, it's Mona. From the wedding.
你好吗012---How are you?
我很好  但你欠我一只舞012---I'm good, except you owe me a dance.
没错012---That's right.
你想看乌克兰电影吗012---Well, would you be interested in seeing a Ukrainian film?
你是认真的  好吧012---Oh, you're serious. Sure.
太棒了012---Great. Well...
我想再来一杯咖啡012---I think I need one more cup of coffee.
没问题  我去帮你买  好012--- Sure, let me get it for you.  Okay.
巴伯012---Bob?
巴伯012---Bob!
巴伯012---Bob!
你到底在做什么012---What the hell are you doing?
我刚发现这是钱德勒的办公室012---I just find out this is Chandler's office.
来吧  托比  快来帮我012---Come on, Toby. Give me a hand!
伙计们  你们猜怎么了  什么012--- Guys, guess what?  What?
我知道时间紧迫  但我们决定要办万圣节派对012---I know it's last minute, but we decided to have a Halloween party.
很好  太棒了012--- Good!  Great!
所有人都得变装  我没办法参加012--- And everybody has to wear costumes.  I can't make it.
少来了  一定会很好玩的012---Come on, it'll be fun.
我会去的012---I'll be there.
反正那天上课时我也要变装012---I have to wear a costume to my classes that day anyway.
你不会打扮成恐龙吧012---Tell me you're not gonna dress like a dinosaur.
我怎么会连续两年的扮相一样012---Not two years in a row.
我会去的  但我不会变装012---I'll come to the party, but I'm not dressing up.
你得变装才行012---You have to.
不行  万圣节太愚蠢了012---No way. Halloween is so stupid.
变装  假装自己是另一个人012---Dressing up, pretending to be someone you're not.
你可是个演员012---You're an actor.
罗斯  你会带蒙娜来吗012---Ross, are you gonna bring Mona?
我会的012---Yeah, I think I will.
你在婚礼上认识的那个漂亮女孩  对012--- The hot girl from their wedding?  Yeah.
我给她出几个变装的点子012---If she needs any ideas for costumes,
她可以扮成比基尼模特012---she could be a bikini model...
或风骚护士  或性感啦啦队长012---...or a slutty nurse, or a sexy cheerleader.
或是《德州电锯杀人狂》里的皮脸012---Or Leatherface from Texas Chainsaw Massacre.
不  还是风骚的皮脸好了012---No, no, no! Slutty Leatherface.
乔伊不是也在婚礼上跟她眉来眼去的吗012---Now, wasn't Joey hitting on her at the wedding too?
没错  他确实对她有意思012---That's right, he was hitting on her.
而我把到了她  我猜最优质的男人才能赢012---And I got her. I guess the better man won.
拜托  别把她抢走012---Please don't take her from me.
《老友记》  第八季  第6集  万圣节舞会012---Friends S08E06 The One With The Halloween Party
厄休拉012---Ursula!
等一下  是我  菲比012---Wait. It's me, Phoebe.
我还以为那里有面镜子  好吧  再见012---I thought there was a mirror there. Okay. Bye.
等一下012---Wait a second!
你最近有什么情况012---So, what's new with you?
没什么  下星期我就要结婚了012---Nothing. I'm getting married next week.

谢谢  拿去吧012--- Thank you.  There.
你这是什么  应该还没有正规的命名012--- So, what are you?  I don't think they have a name for it.
我一紧张就会满身大汗012---I get nervous, and I sweat like crazy.

如果猫女跟女超人打架  谁会赢呢012---Who do you think would win in a fight, Catwoman or Supergirl?
当然是猫女  是吧012--- Catwoman, hands down.  Yeah.
但你跟菲比  我赌菲比会赢012---Between you and Phoebe ? I'd give the edge to Phoebe.
什么  真的吗  你开什么玩笑012--- What? Really?  You kidding?
菲比在街上混过  好吗012---Phoebe lived on the street, okay?
而且她生起气来跟疯婆子一样012---Plus, she's got a crazy temper.
她没有站在我后面吧012---She's not right behind me, is she?
不  你很安全012---No, you're fine.
我能打倒瑞秋吗  我不确定012--- Could I take Rachel?  I'm not sure.

他是老师  他会做义工012---He's a teacher, he does all this volunteer work.

我们在乌拉圭做义工时012---In fact, when we were building in Uruguay,
只相距两个小镇远  却从来没见过面012---we were two towns apart and we never met.
对  我刚到时那里一片荒芜012---Yeah. It wasn't a town when I got there,

你跟罗斯打架谁会赢012---who could kick whose ass in a fight, you or Ross?
那不成问题  你也觉得罗斯会赢012--- There's no question.  So you think Ross too?
你竟然选罗斯   罗斯真的很强壮012--- You picked Ross?  Ross is really strong.
他是你们三个之中最壮的  乔伊除外012---He's the strongest out of all three of you. Except for Joey.
我不敢相信你没有选我012---I can't believe you didn't pick me.

我更想要钱012---I'd rather have the money.
那由不得你来选  万圣节快乐012---That's not your choice. Happy Halloween!
这不公平012---This isn't fair.
你只要披上斗篷012---Is it fair that all you did was put on a cape
我就要白送你东西  那公平吗012---and I gotta give you free stuff?
闭嘴012---Shut up!

我去拿支票簿012---Let me get my checkbook!
亲爱的  你不必这么做012---Look, honey. You don't have to do this, okay?

你既忠心又老实  而且还为人正直012---You're loyal, and you're honest and you have integrity.
这才是我希望在深爱的男人身上看到的品质012---That's the kind of strength I want in a man that I love.
那对我来说毫无意义  来吧012---That means nothing to me. Come on!
嗨  骗子012---Hi, liar.
他之所以会娶你012---You know, the only reason he's marrying you
是因为他以为你说的话都是真的012---is because he thinks the things you were saying were true.
有可能是真的  但你在说慌012--- They could be true.  But they're not.
真假只有一线之隔012---Yeah. It's a fine line.
你为什么要说谎  我不知道012--- Why are you lying to him?  I don't know.
他跟我说自己做过的事  我说我也做过012---He said he did all these stuff, I said I did it too.
他就变得很兴奋  我觉得很好玩012---and he got so excited, it was really fun.

祝你们好运012---So I just want to wish you all the luck in the world.
我想我们会幸福的012---I think we'll be okay.
一切都很完美  她一直为我保持处女之身012---It's so perfect, and she's been saving herself for me.
我不能让你这么被骗下去了  她在说谎012---Okay, I can't let you do this. She's lying to you.
什么012---What?
她在说谎  我可以证明  稍等012---She is lying. And I bet I could prove it. Excuse me.

心地却完全不同012---And so different.
艾力克  我们走吧012---Eric! Let's go!
我得去解决这个问题  没错  应该的012--- Better go deal with it.  Yeah, you should.
快点  我得去祷告012---Hurry up! I gotta pray!
我得给那孩子50块  他才不哭了012---Well, I had to give the kid 50 bucks to stop crying.
那还不赖012---That's not so bad.
我还得当他的女朋友  陪他走家串户012---No, I also had to go to a couple houses with him as his girlfriend.
我真的不会应付小孩子012---I am just awful with children.
你跟孩子们相处得很好012---Come on. You're good with kids.
只是小孩子在万圣节都会抓狂012---They're just crazy on Halloween.
他们贪心地想多拿一些糖果012---They're all greedy, hopped up on sugar.
就因为这个吗  当然012--- Really? That's all it is?  Absolutely.
万圣节最难搞了012---Halloween is the worst.
除了圣诞节  跟他们的生日012---Except for Christmas. And their birthdays.
他们在暑假也会抓狂012---Kinda get a little crazy during the summer too.
还有他们肚子饿跟想睡觉的时候012---And any time they're hungry or sleepy.
小孩子很难缠  祝你好运012---Kids are tough. Good luck with that.
你输了  我很遗憾012---Look, I wanted to tell I'mI'm sorry you lost.
我得告诉你一个秘密  是我放水让他赢的012---Listen, I've got a secret for ya. I let him win.
那是秘密还是谎话012---Was that a secret, or a lie?
不  我让他...罗斯  什么事012--- No, I let him... Ross?  Yeah?
麻烦你告诉她我放水让你赢012---Would you tell her I let you win, please?
钱德勒"放水让我赢"012---Yeah. Chandler "let me win."
不  钱德勒真的好壮012---No, Chandler's really strong.
我的手好酸  护士012---My arm is so sore. Oh, nurse?
我很强壮  我要证明给你看012---I am strong. I'll show you.
钱德勒  拜托012---Chandler, please.
怎么了  你害怕吗012---What's the matter? Are you scared?
放马过来吧  大兔子012---Let's go, big bunny!
一  二  三  开始012---One, two, three. Go!
我想自杀012---I'm gonna kill myself!
天啊  你打扫过了012---Oh, my God, you cleaned!
瞧这地板  你还擦了窗户012---Look at these floors! You did the windows!
我跟你提了好几个月  你真的打扫了012---I have been begging you for months! And you did, you cleaned.
看来唠叨还是有用的012---And nagging works!
不  事实上这不是我干的012---No, I didn't actually do this.
不是吧  我又梦游打扫了吗012---Oh, no. Was I cleaning in my sleep again?
不  也不是你012---No, it wasn't you.
那么是谁  我请了一个女佣  耶012--- Well, then, who?  I got a maid. Yay!
我希望你所说的"女佣"是指"情妇"012---I hope by "maid" you mean "mistress"
因为如果有其他女人在打扫咱家房子的话012---because if some other woman was cleaning...
亲爱的  我知道你不喜欢让出控制权012---Now, honey, I know you don't like to relinquish control.
"让出"就是"失去"的委婉说法吧012---"Relinquish" is just a fancy word for "lose."
她人真的很棒012---She's really nice, okay?
她还说她喜欢你摆放海绵的方式012---And she mentioned that she adored the way you arranged the sponges.
她真的那么说了吗012---Did she really say that?
对  我记得很清楚  因为我以为她在开玩笑012---Yes, I distinctly remember because I thought it was a joke.
给她一个机会  好吗012---Now, just give her a chance, okay?
好吧  我办得到012---Fine, I can do it.
怎么了012---What's the matter?
通常我一焦虑就会打扫012---Usually when I'm this anxious, I clean.
《老友记》  第八季  第7集  墨水印012---Friends S08E07 The One With The Stain
是谁的手机在响  吵死了012---Whose cell phone is that? It's just so annoying.
走到哪里都会发生这种事012---Everywhere you go.
我想声音是从你的包包里传出来的012---I think it's coming from your bag.
从来没有人会打电话给我012---I never get calls!
喂012---Hello?
嗨  我是万圣节派对上的艾力克012---Hi, it's Eric, from the Halloween party.
厄休拉的未婚夫012---Ursula's fiance.
天啊  艾力克  嗨012---Oh, my God, Eric, hi!
等一下  你怎么知道我的电话号码012---Wait, how'd you get this number?
我有个警察朋友  他帮我查到的012---I have a friend who's a cop, and he got it for me.
这严重侵犯了我的权利  但却让人又惊又喜012---Wow. What an incredible violation and wonderful surprise!
我想告诉你012---Listen, I just... I thought you should know
我跟厄休拉分手了012---I broke up with Ursula.
是吗  他办到了012---Oh, you did? He did it, he did it!
他做了什么  我在讲电话012--- What did he do?  I'm talking!
总之我很好奇012---Anyway, I was wondering
你平时吃不吃午餐012---if you were the sort of person who eats lunch?
你是在约我吗012---Are you asking me out?
因为那样会很奇怪012---Because it'd be kind of weird
你刚刚才跟我姐姐分手012---since you just broke up with my sister.
好吧  抱歉012---Yeah, okay. I'm sorry.
再见  不  等一下012--- Bye.  No, no. Wait!
我那么说是希望你觉得我是个好人012---I was just saying that so you'd think I was a good person.
努力争取我吧012---Fight for me.
我不会轻易接受你的拒绝012---I won't take "no" for an answer.
虽然表现不太好  但我们可以边吃午餐边练习012---Not great, but we can work on it at lunch.
我可以在两小时内赶到你家012---I can be at your apartment in two hours.
太棒了  你怎么知道我住在哪里012---Great. How do you know where I live?
我也有朋友012---I've got friends too.
好吧  再见  再见012--- Okay, bye.  Bye.
天啊  我要跟艾力克约会了012---Oh, my God, I'm going out with Eric!
今天比我想像中012---This day is really gonna be so much better
还要美好012---than I thought it was gonna be.
罗斯  我没办法跟你吃午餐了012---Oh, Ross, I can't make lunch.
很明显我午餐时间有空012---So apparently I'm available for lunch.
不行  我很忙  我在找房子012---I can't. I'm busy. I'm apartment hunting.
你要搬家012---You're moving?
孩子生下来后我不可能跟乔伊一起住012---I can't live with Joey once the baby comes.
我不希望我的孩子会说的第一句话是012---I don't want my child's first words to be,
"你好吗"012---"How you doing?"
乔伊知道你要搬家吗012---So does Joey know you're moving?
我还没有跟他谈  但我知道他会觉得如释重负012---I haven't discussed it with him, but I know he'll be relieved.
上星期他带了一个女孩回家012---Last week, he brought this girl over,
我跟她谈晨吐的问题012---and I talked to her about morning sickness.
还把我怀孕纪念册的照片拿给她看012---Then I showed her pictures from my pregnancy book.
内容不会很色情吧  不太会012--- That's not really porn?  Not so much.
既然你在找房子012---You know what? If you're looking for a place,
今早我在电梯里听说012---I just heard in the elevator this morning
我住的公寓里有个女住户过世了012---that a woman in my building died.
天啊  她年纪很老了吗012---Oh, my God. Was she old?
她的公寓景观好吗012---Does she have a view?
我不知道  但那样一定会很棒012---I don't know, but how great would that be?
你搬到我的公寓里来012---You living in my building?
我可以照顾宝宝  想过去就过去...012---I could take care of the baby, I could come over whenever I want...
当然得先得到你的允许012---...with your permission.
那就太好了  我们能去看看吗012---That really would be great. Well, can we see it?
或许我们不该那么做012---Maybe we shouldn't.
毕竟她今天早上才过世012---I mean, if she just died this morning out of respect.
对  你说得对012---Yeah. No. No, you're right.
我们去吧  好啊012--- Shall we?  Yeah.
有什么事吗012---Yes?
嗨  我是罗斯·盖勒  住在这栋公寓里012---Hi. I'm Ross Geller. I live in the building.
我是瑞秋  我很喜欢这栋公寓012---And I'm Rachel, an admirer of the building.
听说佛哈芬太太过世了012---I heard about Mrs. Verhoeven passing away,
我真的很遗憾012---and I am so sorry for your loss.
她没有过世  什么012--- She didn't pass away.  What?
我妈妈还活着012---My mother's still alive.
谢天谢地012---Oh, thank God!
她今天早上差点就过世了012---It looked like we were gonna lose her this morning,
但她是个意志力很强的老太婆012---but she's a tough old bird.
你跟她很熟吗012---Are you close with her?
当然  我们常常012---Of course. She and I would talk all the time...
在洗衣间聊天012---...in the laundry room.
你会说荷兰语吗012---You speak Dutch?
很荣幸见到我母亲的朋友（荷兰语）012---I'm very honored to meet a friend of my mother.
我会说  但说起来只会让我伤心012---You know, I would, but it's just too painful.
她真的没死012---So she's really not dead.
对  她还在坚持012---No. She's hanging in there.
你能告诉我她是在一房还是两房里坚持吗012---Could you tell me, is she hanging in in a onebedroom or a two?
宾太太  这个清洁剂太棒了012---Mrs. Bing, this tile cleaner is incredible.
你在哪里买的012---Where did you get it?
那是我自制的012---Oh, well... I make it myself.
两份的氨水加一份的柠檬汁012---It's two parts ammonia and one part lemon juice.
秘方是...012---The secret ingredient is...
你知道吗  我们才刚刚认识012---You know what? We just met.
好吧  我去洗衣间拿衣服012---Okay. I'm gonna go get the clothes from the laundry room now.
我回来后会打扫冰箱后面012---When I come back, I'll clean behind the refrigerator.
我爱她012---I love her.
我马上回来012---I'll be back in a minute.
好吧012---Okay.
看吧  我告诉过你012---See? I told you.
她偷了我的牛仔裤012---She stole my jeans!
什么012---What?
我找了一个星期  她正穿在身上012---I've been looking for them all week, and she is wearing them.
所以她偷了你的裤子012---So she stole your pants
然后当着你的面穿在身上012---and then came back and wore them in front of you?
你不明白吗  这是完美犯罪012---Don't you see? It's the perfect crime!
她一定计划了好几年012---She must have been planning this for years!
我会证明给你看012---I'll prove it to you, okay.
几周前  我穿着那条牛仔裤012---About a week ago I was wearing those jeans
我把钢笔掉在大腿上012---and I dropped a pen in my lap,
在裆部留下了墨水印子012---and it left an ink stain on the crotch.
她回来后012---When she comes back,
我就让你看看那个墨水印子012---I will find it and show you that stain!
亲爱的  卖那条牛仔裤的公司012---Honey, isn't it possible the company that sold the jeans
难道只做了一条牛仔裤吗012---made more than just the one pair?
说得有道理012---I guess.
我们应该先找找看012---So should't we give her the benefit of the doubt
再去看她的裆部吧012---before we go snooping around her crotch?
好吧  幸好我没告诉她我的秘方012---Fine. I'm just glad I didn't give her my secret ingredient.
我真的很好奇你的秘方是什么012---Out of curiosity, what is your secret ingredient?
你想得美012---Yeah.
请进  我很高兴你能过来012---Come in. I'm so glad you're here.
对  我也是012---Yeah. Me too.
但不像你那么震惊愤怒012---Not in the shaky, angry way that you are, though.
抱歉  我刚刚见过厄休拉012---Sorry. I just saw Ursula.
我得把订婚戒指拿回来012---I had to get the engagement ring back.
看到她  让我想起了一切012---Just seeing her brought it all back.
那些谎言  还有她是怎么利用我的012---All the lies, the way she used me.
我只是...012---I just...
光是看到她  我就觉得好生气...012---I get so angry, just looking at her...
我是说看到她的脸  对012--- Face.  Yeah. Yeah.
抱歉  我看到你的时候012---I'm sorry. It's just, when I look at you...
我就像是看到了她012---...I see her.
我看到她时012---And when I see her,
就会觉得很生气012---I get a little bit angry.
这样太奇怪了  等一下012--- Maybe this is too weird.  Wait.
只有我看着你的时候才会觉得生气012---There's only a problem when I look at you.
我知道了012---I got it. I got it.
不  别把你的眼睛挖出来012---No, don't tear out your eyes!
我只是要把隐形眼镜摘掉012---I was just gonna take out my lenses.
好吧  试试看012---Oh, yeah. Try that.
那样子好多了吗012---So is that better?
才怪012---Not really.
你看起来很模糊  还是很像厄休拉012---You're blurry, but you still look like Ursula.
你是"模糊的厄休拉"012---You're "Blursula."
好吧  等一下  也许012---Okay, wait. Maybe...
我暂时不看你012---If I just don't look at you for a while.
看吧  很有效果  我一点都不生气了012---See? It works. I'm not angry at all anymore.
这次约会很成功012---This is a great date!
听着  艾力克  转过来012---Look, Eric, turn around.
我喜欢你  但不应该这么纠结012---I like you, but it shouldn't be this hard.
这是我们第一次约会012---This is our first date.
第一次约会应该是兴奋刺激  火花四射012---First dates are supposed to be about excitement and electricity and...
"他刚刚摸了我的手  他是有意的吗 "012---..."He just touched my hand, did he mean to touch my hand"
还有初吻012---and you know first kisses...
第二次接吻012---Second kisses.
谢谢你的咖啡  或者说012---Thanks for the coffee, or:
谢谢你的咖啡  甘瑟（荷兰语）012---bedankt voor de koffie, Gunter.
你会说荷兰话吗  真厉害（荷兰语）012---You speak Dutch? That's cool.
你有亲戚在荷兰吗（荷兰语）012---Do you have relatives there?
我们聊完了012---Yeah, we're done.
混蛋（荷兰语）012---Ezel.
混蛋  混蛋012---Ezel. Ezel.
罗斯012---Hey, Ross. Listen.
你要去人工造浪池看新的立体巨幕电影吗012---You wanna go see that new IMAX movie on tide pools?
真的吗  才没有012--- Really?  No.
但我帮你  我跟钱德勒弄到了尼克队的门票012---But I got Knicks tickets for you, me and Chandler.
太棒了012---Sweet!
等你喝完咖啡  咱们就出发012---All right, well finish your coffee, let's go.
我得先回家一趟012---Okay. I have to stop by my place first.
你要录球赛吗  你每次都要录012---To tape the game? You do this every time, Ross.
你是不会上电视的012---You're not gonna be on TV!
不  我得去看看那间公寓是不是空出来了012---No, I have to see if this apartment became available.
你要换公寓吗012---You're switching apartments?
不是我  是瑞秋要搬家012---It's not for me, it's for Rachel.
她已经有公寓了012---Rachel has an apartment.
宝宝一出生  她就要搬家012---Yeah, but when the baby comes, she's gonna wanna move.
真的吗  对012--- She is?  Yeah.
你该不会希望她跟宝宝住在你那里吧012---You didn't expect her to live there with the baby, did you?
我没仔细想过012---I guess I didn't really think about it.
混蛋012---Ezel.
甘瑟  你才是个混蛋012---Hey, Gunther, you're an ezel.
你和混蛋性交了（荷兰语）012---You have sex with donkeys.
该死012---Damn it!
你的牛仔裤很漂亮  谢谢012--- Nice jeans.  Oh, thanks.
我喜欢你的上衣  你别想得手012--- I like your top.  Oh. You're not getting it.
发生了什么事  我睡着了012--- What happened?  Oh. I fell asleep!
我想要午休一下012---I was thinking about taking my lunch break.
你能擦一下橱柜上面吗012---Will you do the top of the cabinets?
那会让你午餐时食欲大增012---That'll work up your appetite for lunch.
好吧012---All right.
你好啊012---Hello.
发生了什么事012---What's going on?
抱歉  我以前没请过女佣012---I'm sorry. I've never had a maid before.
这样做不合适吗012---Is this not okay?
球赛怎么样012---How was the game?
还不错  我吃太多了012---It was okay. I ate way too much.
我跟罗斯谈过  他说你在找新公寓012---I was talking to Ross, and he said you were looking for a new place.
对  我希望能搬到对街去012---Yeah. Hopefully across the street.
如果那些荷兰人愿意让出公寓012---If certain Dutch people would just let go.
我希望你留下来012---I was kind of hoping you'd stay.
乔伊  我得搬走  这里容不下一个宝宝012---Joey, I have to go. There's no room for a baby here.
容不下  宝宝也就这么大吧012---No room? It's a baby. It's, like, this big.
你可以把他放在这里012---You could put it over here.
或是这里  很可爱吧012---Or we could put it right here. It's cute, right?
或是这里  你根本就不会注意到他012---Or put it over here. You wouldn't even notice it.
"宝宝在哪里 "  "他就在..."012---"Where's the baby?" "Oh, it's right over..."
亲爱的  问题不仅在于要把他放在哪里012---Honey, it's not just a matter of where you put it.
宝宝会让你的生活翻天覆地012---A baby changes everything.
他们总是哭个不停012---They cry all the time.
如果你带女孩回家012---Imagine bringing home some girl
想跟她上床时  宝宝却哭个不停012---and trying to score with a screaming baby around.
我可以接受这个挑战  算不上什么难事012---I could use a challenge. It's getting pretty easy.
你要我留下来  真的很贴心012---It's so sweet that you want me to stay,
但我不能那么对你012---but I can't do that to you.
那样会毁了你的生活012---It would disrupt your entire life.
只是...012---It's just...
我很喜欢跟你一起住012---I love living with you so much.
我希望一切都不必改变  我知道012--- I wish things didn't have to change.  I know.
这件事全怪罗斯012---You know, I blame Ross for this.
我也有点怪他012---I do too, a little bit.
我会想念你的012---I'm gonna miss you.
你是我遇过最辣的室友012---You're the hottest roommate I ever had.
不行  我得走了  有人预约我去按摩012---Oh, no, I have to go. I have a massage appointment.
别  留下来  我们继续吧012---No, stay here. We'll keep doing this.
我可以付钱给你012---I'll pay you.
不行  之前我因为这个惹上了大麻烦012---No, I've gotten in trouble for that before.
待会见  没问题012--- I'll see you later?  Absolutely.
我喜欢你的吻技012---I love the way you kiss.
真的吗  那是我最逊的方面012---Really? That's the thing I'm worst at!
你等着瞧吧012---You'll see.
我觉得布兰达需要加薪  为什么012--- Hey. I think Brenda needs a raise.  How come?
因为我把头放在她的双腿之间012---Because I put my head between her legs.
为了看她的裤子吗  那是我的裤子012--- To see her pants?  They're my pants!
你确定吗  你看到墨水印子了吗012---Are you sure? Did you see the stain?
没有  我才刚刚就位  就眼前一片漆黑012---No. I was getting into position, and then everything went dark.
她没有偷我们的东西  你能不能算了012---She is not stealing from us, okay. Will you let this go?
好吧012---Fine.
她穿着我的胸罩  天啊012--- She's wearing my bra!  Oh, dear God!
我的粉红色小花胸罩  我认得那条肩带012---My pink, flowered bra! I recognize the strap!
那你没意识到自己疯了吗012---Yet you don't recognize that you're crazy?
我有个计划012---Here's the plan.
我先离开  你去看布兰达的胸罩012---I'm going to leave, and you're gonna look at Brenda's bra.
我也有个计划012---Here's another plan.
不要012---No.
本可以由我来做  但她以为我喜欢她012---I would do it, but she thinks I'm attracted to her.
为什么012---Why?
你不知道刚刚我的头插到哪里了吗012---Did you not hear where my head was?
我们是一帮的  在这件事上应该同进退012---Come on, come on. We're a team. We're in this together.
我担心陪审团也会那么认为012---I fear a jury will see it the same way.
就算是为了我012---Do this for me.
我常抓到你在瞄女人胸部012---I catch you looking at womers breasts all the time.
你看到了吗012---You see that?
这样难道你看不到吗012---Do you see this?
好吧  我了解你的意思012---All right, yes. Okay. I get your point.
但如果那不是你的胸罩012---But if it's not your bra,
你能让她接着安心打扫吗012---will you just let the woman clean the apartment?
没问题012---Yes. Absolutely.
是不是我的你能分辨出来  因为在右罩杯上012---You'll know it's mine because on the right cup,
蕾丝的部分  有明显的开线012---the lacey part, there's a very noticeable rip.
你需要买新衣服了012---You need new clothes.
她还好吗  情况看起来不妙012--- Hi. How is she?  It's not looking good.
我带了一些花过来给她012---Well, I brought her some bloemen.
你太体贴了  你要跟她送别吗012---That's so sweet. Would you like to come in and say goodbye?
那对她来说一定意义重大012---I'm sure it would mean a lot to her.
这我还真没想到012---Oh, I don't know that it would.
她几乎不记得任何人了  那么好吧012--- Well, her memory is pretty much gone.  All right, then.
欢迎你回来012---Welcome back.
我们要继续吗012---Shall we pick up from where we left off?
今天下午过后  我还没缓过劲来012---I don't know. I'm still tired from this afternoon.
为什么  我们做爱了012--- Why?  The sex.
什么  你跟我做爱了012--- What sex?  Our sex.
我们没做爱啊012---We didn't have sex.
如果我没跟你做爱012---If I didn't have sex with you,
我一定是跟一个长得跟你很像...012---I had sex with somebody that looked an awful lot like...
不会吧012---Oh, no. Oh, no.
不会吧012---No, no, no.
你跟厄休拉做爱了  做了一点012--- You had sex with Ursula?  A little bit.
她走进来  我以为她是你  我吻了她...012---She walked in, I thought she was you and I kissed her and...
你没注意到衣服不一样吗012---You didn't notice different clothes?
我看到你太兴奋了012---I was just so excited to see you.
这真的是太奇怪了012---You know what? This is too weird.
不会的  我不想失去你012---No, it's not. I don't wanna lose you.
在做爱的时候012---It's like I was saying to Ursula
我以为厄休拉是你  我对她说...012---when I was making love to her and I thought she was you...
对  那太奇怪了012---Yeah. It's too weird.
那就到此为止吧012---So I guess this is it.
好012---Yeah.
或许这是最好的办法012---Maybe it's for the best.
你的味道跟她一样  对  你也是012--- You smell just like her.  Yeah, so do you.
你在做什么  我在屈伸012--- What are you doing?  I'm leaning.
我都在这里做屈伸运动012---This is where I lean.
好吧012---Okay.
布兰达  有蜜蜂  什么012--- Brenda, a bee!  What?
它飞进你上衣里了012---Yes! It's flown into your blouse,
你最好快解开扣子  免得被叮伤012---and you better undo your buttons lest it sting you.
我想我知道这是怎么一回事了  是吗012--- I think I know what's going on here.  You do?
你太太是女同志  我知道你一定很难受012---Look, I know it must be hard that your wife is a lesbian...
但这是不对的  你结婚了012---...but it's wrong. You're married.
我完全了解  太好了012--- I totally understand.  Okay, good.
我能看看你的胸罩吗012---Could I just see your bra?
你怎么会有那条牛仔裤  是你送我的012--- Where'd you get those jeans?  You gave them to me.
我才没有  好吧  是我自己拿的012--- No, I didn't!  All right, I took them.
我以为你不会介意012---I figured it'd be okay
因为在裆部的地方有一大块墨水印子012---because you've got a big ink stain on the crotch.
不要啊  你也拿走了我的胸罩吗012---Oh, no! Did you take my bra too?
什么胸罩012---What bra?
有小花的粉红色胸罩012---The pink one with the flowers.
你是说你正穿的这件胸罩吗012---You mean the one you're wearing?
我不干了012---I quit!
可以理解012---Sounds about right.
这是什么012---What is this?
我只是做一下大致构想012---This is just to give you an idea.
我们可以在这里装拉帘  给宝宝留有隐私012---We can put screens here so that the baby has privacy...
在摇篮上面装个音乐铃012---...and maybe a mobile over the crib...
这是宝宝监控器012---...and here's a baby monitor
宝宝没出生前  我们可以把它当对讲机012---which, till the baby comes, we can use as walkietalkies.
你真的是太体贴了012---You're so sweet!
天啊  你帮宝宝买了企鹅宝宝012---Oh, my God! And you gave the baby Hugsy!
我只是要向你示范宝宝该躺在哪里012---That's really just to show where the baby would go.
快把它交给我吧  免得你误会了012---Why don't I hold on to him so there's no confusion.
乔伊  宝宝会哭的  那会非常地吵012---Joey, the baby is gonna be crying. It's gonna be loud.
我本身就很吵  他会整晚不睡012--- I'm loud.  It's gonna be up all night.
我也会  他会大便012--- I'm up all night.  It's gonna poop.
难道我不是吗012---Hello!
那你带回家的姑娘们怎么办012---What about all the women you wanna bring home?
如果我把一个姑娘带回家012---Look. If I'm bringing home a woman
她连和宝宝相处都做不到012---who can't stand being around a baby...
那或许我根本不该跟那个姑娘在一起012---...then maybe I don't wanna be with that woman.
或许我们该在酒吧的洗手间里做爱012---Or maybe we'll do it in the bathroom of the club!
乔伊  你确定吗012---Joey, are you sure?
对  听着  我知道有时候会很辛苦012---Yeah. Look, I know sometimes it'll be hard, okay...
但同时也会非常幸福愉快012---...but it'll also be really, really great.
拜托  瑞秋  我真的希望你留下来012---Please, Rachel, I really want you to stay.
我也想留下来  谢谢你012---I want me to stay too. Thank you.
乔伊  看看这个摇篮  好可爱012---Joey, look at this crib. It's so cute.
我知道  我是在街上捡到的012---I know. I found it on the street.
你是...  真的吗  看起来还不错012---Are you...? Really? This is in such good condition.
是啊012---Yeah.
被子下面是什么012---Whoa! What's under the cover?
我不知道  它在动012--- I don't know.  It's moving.
它长了尾巴  快把它搬出去012---It's got a tail! Get it out of here!
好吧012---Okay!
那位老太大过世了  我怎么会知道呢012---Well, the old lady died. And how do I know?
因为她的遗愿是给她最后一吻012---Because her dying wish was for one last kiss.
但我不在乎012---But I don't care,
因为你拿到那间公寓了  太棒了012---because you got the apartment. Yes!
是啊012---Yeah.
我想要留在这里012---I think I'm gonna stay here.
很棒吧012---Isn't that great?
什么  你...但是...012---What...? You... But... Bu...
两个混蛋012---Ezels.
菲比  明晚我要跟我爸一起吃饭012---Hey, Pheebs. I'm having dinner with my dad tomorrow night.
你要来吗012---Do you wanna come?
好啊  他挺性感的012---Sure, yeah. He's kind of sexy.
不  我也会去012---Oh, no, I'll be there too.
行  那么我们得想个暗号012---Okay. So we'll come up with some kind of signal.
如果一切进行顺利  你可以离开012---If it's going well, you can take off.
不  我是要你过去陪我012---No, I just need you there for support.
我还没有告诉他我怀孕了012---I haven't told him that I'm pregnant yet.
为什么012---Oh. Why not?
因为我知道他会气炸了012---Because I know he's gonna flip out,
我讨厌他生气的样子012---and I hate it when he's angry.
瑞秋  这跟《爸爸别说教》如出一辙012---Rachel, this is all so "Papa Don't Preach." 
不  菲比  等一下  他非常严厉012---No, Phoebe, wait. He's a scary guy.
有次他抓到我抽烟012---I mean, one time he caught me smoking.
他说如果他再看到我抽烟012---He said if he ever saw me doing that again,
他就逼我把一整包烟吃掉012---he'd make me eat the entire pack.
那我一定得去012---Wow. Well, I will be there.
天啊  我不会让那个男人逼你把宝宝吃掉012---Gosh, I'm not gonna let that man make you eat your baby!
那个家伙是谁  我想我认识他012---Hey, who is that guy? I think I know him.
才怪  你怎么会认识012--- No, you don't.  No, you don't.
天啊012---Oh, my God!
莫妮卡  他是你单身女郎派对上的脱衣舞男012---Monica, he's the stripper from your bachelorette party!
什么012---Her what?
你的秘密单身女郎派对012---Your secret bachelorette party.
你办了单身女郎派对012---You had a bachelorette party?
她用牙解开了他的丁字裤012---She untied his Gstring with her teeth.
谁快让我住嘴012---Somebody stop me!
我们不是说好不办单身汉或单身女郎派对吗012---I thought we weren't having bachelor, bachelorette parties.
我们都觉得这个传统很愚蠢012---We agreed that it's a silly tradition.
那个传统棒极了012---It's a grand tradition!
抱歉  她们给了我一个大惊喜012---I'm sorry. They surprised me.
我真的没有办法012---There was nothing I could do.
你可以用手解嘛012---Well, you could've untied it with your hands.
这太不公平了012---This is so unfair.
我非常想帮我最好的朋友办单身汉派对012---The one thing I wanted was to throw my best friend a bachelor party...
却不能那么做012---...but I wasn't allowed to.
我们只能一起去吃牛排012---All we got was a stupid steak dinner.
女服务生跟你回家睡了012---You went home with the waitress.
对  那一晚真的很美妙012---Yeah, that was a pretty good night.
我不敢相信你没有告诉我012---I can't believe you didn't tell me.
你知道婚姻的两大支柱012---You know that the two pillars of marriage
是公开跟诚实012---are openness and honesty.
我就知道送你那本书012---I knew giving you that book
总有一天我自己会遭报应012---was gonna come back and bite me in the ass.
《老友记》  第八季  第8集  脱衣舞娘012---Friends S08E08 The One With The Stripper
我帮大家点摩洛哥鸡肉怎么样012---How about I order everyone the Moroccan chicken?
我不吃肉012---Oh, I don't eat meat.
那是鸡肉012---It's chicken!
那个我也不吃012---I don't eat that either.
我一直都搞不懂你们女同志012---I never understand you lesbians.
宝贝  告诉我  你最近怎么样012---So, baby, tell me, what's new with you?
事实上...012---Well, actually...
您的74年拉费红酒  先生012---Your '74 Lafite, sir.
74年012---'74?
我点的是75年的  那一年的酒味道醇美012---I ordered the '75. That's a magnificent wine.
74年的酒烂透了012---The '74 is sewage!
你为什么要给我上那么烂的酒012---Why would you bring me sewage?
这个问题很难吗012---Is that a hard question?
你是白痴吗  所以你才会来当服务生012---Are you an idiot? Is that why you're a waiter?
这就是我告诉经理今晚不想为你服务的原因012---This is why I told the manager i wouldn't wait on you tonight.
少来了  别那么幼稚012---Oh, come on. Don't be such a baby.
你应该注意到了他真的很吓人012---In case you didn't notice, that is a scary man.
但他说得对  74年的酒真的很难喝012---He's right, though. The '74 is absolute piss.
这是个天大的错误  菲比012---This was such a huge mistake.
我不敢告诉他  菲比  我做不到012---I can't tell him, Phoebe. I can't. I can't. I can't.
瑞秋...  没事  这样吧012--- Rachel...  No, it's okay. This is what's gonna happen.
我再等上几年012---I'm gonna wait a couple of years,
然后宝宝会告诉他012---and then the baby will tell him.
怎么  让他拿宝宝撒气吗012---Why? So he can get mad at the baby?
那就是宝宝要解决的问题了012---Hey, that is the baby's problem.
服务生没问题吧012---Everything okay with the waiter?
我不知道  我去了洗手间012---I have no idea. I went to the bathroom.
甜心  你刚才准备告诉我你的近况012---So, sweetie, you were starting to tell me what is new with you.
我有了012---I got TiVo.
什么是有了  就是怀孕的意思012--- What's TiVo?  It's slang for "pregnant."
菲比012---Phoebe.
你真的怀孕了吗012---Are you really pregnant?
对也不对012---Well, yes and no.
但"不对"是不对的答案012---Except, not no.
总而言之  对012---So to sum it up, yeah.
孩子的爸爸是谁012---Who is the father?
不  拜托  别告诉就是她012---Oh, no. Please don't tell me it's her.
不  是罗斯  你喜欢罗斯012---No, it's Ross. It's Ross. You like Ross.
爸爸  我希望你能接受这件事012---Daddy, I hope you're okay with all of this.
想一想  这是件好事012---Think about it. This is a good thing.
这是你第一个外孙012---This is your first grandchild!
你要当外公了012---You're gonna be a poppy!
没错  我要当外公了012---That's true. I'm a poppy!
我要当外公了012---I'm gonna be a poppy!
婚礼什么时候举行  谁的婚礼012--- So when is the wedding?  The who?
婚礼  你们得举行婚礼012---The wedding. There's going to be a wedding.
小姑娘  你休想坐在那里告诉我012---Young lady, don't you sit there and tell me
我的第一个外孙会是个私生子012---my first grandchild is gonna be a bastard!
瑞秋·凯伦·格林  告诉我你们会举行婚礼012---Rachel Karen Green, tell me there is gonna be a wedding!
二月二日举行012---February 2nd!
今天去看你上课感觉很棒012---It was really cool seeing you lecture today.
谢谢  虽然我觉得你看起来012---Thanks. Although it kind of seemed like
像是睡着了012---you were falling asleep there a little.
不  我闭上眼睛012---No, no, I had my eyes closed
是为了专心听讲  好好消化吸收012---so I could concentrate and, you know, take it all in.
我很多学生都会那么做012---Yeah, a lot of my students do that.
我得走了  今晚见012--- I've got to get going.  Okay, I'll see you tonight?
好  再见012--- Yeah, okay.  Bye.
谢谢你让我参观你收集的半宝石012---Thanks for showing me your semipreciousstone collection.
真的很棒012---It's amazing.
天啊  你的床上功夫一定很厉害012---My God, you must be good in bed.
你跟蒙娜交往了一阵子  情况如何012---So you and Mona, it's been a while now. How's it going?
很不错012---It's good. It's going good.
我们处得很好  她很...012---I mean, we get along great. She's so...
辣  我本来说很温柔  但你答对了012--- Hot?  I was gonna say sweet, but yeah!
她能接受瑞秋和宝宝的事吗012---She's okay with Rachel and the baby?
我还没有告诉她012---I haven't actually told her yet.
我不想吓跑她012---I don't wanna scare her off, you know?
你得老实说012---You have to be honest with her.
不然的话  你以为你们的方向一致012---Otherwise, you may think you're going down the same path...
事实上你们走上了不同的道路012---...but you're really going down different ones.
我要把那本书抢过来  拿它把你打死012---I'm gonna take that book and I'm gonna beat you to death with it.
天啊  你一定会爱死我的012---Oh, my God, you are gonna love me so much.
关于单身女郎派对的事  我真的很过意不去012---I felt bad about the bachelorette party thing...
所以今晚你要办单身汉派对012---...so tonight you're gonna have a bachelor party.
什么012---What?
我在餐厅的同事给了我一个电话号码012---I got this number from this guy at work
我雇了一个脱衣舞娘来跳舞给你看012---and I hired a stripper to come dance for you.
我可以进太太名人堂了吧012---Am I going in the wife hall of fame or what?
亲爱的  这太疯狂了  我不要脱衣舞娘012---Honey, that's crazy. I don't want a stripper.
你能让她说完吗012---Will you let the lady talk?
来吧  一定会很好玩的012---Come on, it'll be fun.
这样会让我觉得好过一点012---It'll make me feel so much better.
听着  我很感激  但这样有点奇怪012---Look, I appreciate it, but it's a little creepy.
我已经不是单身汉了012---I'm not a bachelor anymore.
别把它当成是单身汉派对012---Don't think of it as a bachelor party.
把它当成是结婚两个月的礼物012---Think of it as a twomonth anniversary present.
当然  结婚一年是纸婚012---Sure. One year is paper,
两个月的话可以看艳舞012---but two months is lap dance.
拜托  我觉得好过意不去012---Please, I feel so bad.
就去看看那个辣妹脱光衣服吧012---Just watch the hot woman get naked!
好吧  但我这么做是为了你  太帅了012--- Fine, but I'm only doing this for you.  Yeah!
还有乔伊012---And Joey.
谢谢  你还想邀请谁012---Thank you. Who else do you wanna invite?
光罗斯跟乔伊就够丢脸了012---No, no, no. Just Ross and Joey is embarrassing enough.
抱歉  我没办法去  今晚我跟蒙娜有约012---Actually, sorry, I can't even make it. I'm seeing Mona tonight.
谁会为了假单身汉派对012---I understand: who would cancel an actual date
取消真正的约会012---just to go to a fake bachelor party?
抱歉  我得取消今晚的约会  宝贝012---I'm sorry. I gotta cancel tonight, baby.
抱歉我无法参加你想像出来的婚礼012---I'm sorry I won't make it to your imaginary wedding,
那天我很忙012---but I'm busy that day.
我得参加独角兽受洗礼跟小精灵的戒酒会012---I already have a unicorn baptism and a leprechaun bar mitzvah.
我知道  我乱了方寸012---I know, I know. I panicked. I panicked.
我不想让他对着我大叫012---I didn't want him to start yelling at me
把我当成74年拉图红酒012---like I was some '74 Latour.
是拉费012---It's Lafite.
74年拉图红酒喝起来真的很不错012---The '74 Latour is actually drinking quite nicely.
好吧  他来了  我得告诉他  我会很坚强012---All right, here he comes. I'm gonna tell him. I'm gonna be strong.
我刚刚给一个朋友打了电话012---I just called a friend of mine.
我应该我可以在这么短的时间内012---I think I may be able to book The Plaza
订到广场饭店012---on short notice.
真的吗012---Really?
广场饭店012---The Plaza?
爸爸012---Oh, Daddy!
爸爸  我得跟你谈一谈  请坐012---Right. Daddy, I need to talk to you. Please sit down.
什么事  宝贝012---What is it, sweetie?
我们不会举行婚礼012---There's not gonna be a wedding.
罗斯跟我不会结婚  什么012--- Ross and I aren't getting married.  What?
对不起  爸爸  我不敢相信012--- I'm sorry, Daddy.  I don't believe this!
爸爸  请保持冷静012---Daddy, stay calm, please.
保持冷静  你叫我怎么保持冷静012---Stay calm? How do you expect me to stay calm?
我完全无法接受  瑞秋  我要知道为什么012---This is unacceptable, Rachel. And I wanna know why!
因为那个混蛋不愿意娶你吗012---Is it because that punk Ross won't marry you?
是那样吗  对  他说我是瑕疵品012--- That's it. Is that it?  Yes. He says I'm damaged goods.
快结婚了  你很紧张吧012---So, you nervous about getting married?
你这是搞什么名堂012---What are you doing?
我们假装这是你结婚前的单身汉派对012---Let's pretend it's a real bachelor party, before your wedding.
那样比较好玩012---It'll be more fun.
好吧  我不敢相信明天是我的大喜之日012---All right. I can't believe tomorrow's the big day.
知道你再也没法跟别的女人在一起012---How's it feel knowing you're never gonna
你有什么感觉012---be with another woman again?
知道你每天醒过来都会看到同一张脸012---Knowing you're gonna have to wake up to the same face every day...
直到死神来拯救你012---...until you finally have the sweet release of death.
你说得对  这样比较好玩012---You're right. This is more fun.
她来了  快点012---That's her! Okay, come on!
哪个幸运儿是钱德勒012---Which one of you lucky boys is Chandler?
是我012---That's me!
是我012---That's me.
乔伊·崔比安尼  你的头号仰慕者012---Joey Tribbiani. Big fan.
那是卧室吗  对  就在那边012--- Is that a bedroom?  Yeah, right over there.
好吧  你准备好就进来012---All right. Whenever you're ready.
那好奇怪012---That was weird.
她为什么要到卧室去  我等着呢012--- Why would she go in the bedroom?  I'm waiting.
她是...  她是脱光衣服的妓女012--- So she's a...  Yeah, that's one naked hooker.
我喜欢你家  这玩意从哪里来的012---I love your place. Where is this guy from?
那是在加尔各答买的18世纪印度工艺品012---That's an 18thcentury Indian artifact from Calcutta.
原来你不只喜欢研究恐龙012---So you're more than just dinosaurs.
我涉猎很广的012---So much more.
天啊  我很抱歉012---Oh, my God! I am so sorry!
算了  那是在一号码头商店买的012---Forget it. It's from Pier 1.
抱歉012---Sorry.
你以为你可以搞大我女儿的肚子012---You think you can knock up my daughter
然后不娶她吗012---and then not marry her?
我要杀了你012---I'm gonna kill you!
事实上  我现在真的很不方便012---You know, this is actually not a great time for me.
快解释给我听  盖勒012---So come on. Explain yourself, Geller.
你先让我的瑞秋怀孕012---First, you get my Rachel pregnant.
你让瑞秋怀孕了012---You got Rachel pregnant?
谁干的  就是你012--- Who did?  You did!
是的012---Yes.
没错  但那是一夜情  那毫无意义012---Yes, I did, but it was a onenight thing. It meant nothing.
真的吗  我女儿对你来说毫无意义012---Oh? Really? That's what my daughter means to you, nothing?
不是的  她对我来说意义重大012---No, sir. She means a lot to me.
我在乎...我爱瑞秋012---I care... I love Rachel.
什么  但不是那种爱012--- What?  But not that way.
我没有爱上她  我把她当成朋友012---I'm not in love with her. I love her like a friend.
你就是那样对待朋友的吗012---Really? That's how you treat a friend,
你搞大她的肚子又不肯娶她012---you get her in trouble and refuse to marry her?
我有跟她求婚  但我不是真心的012---Hey, I offered to marry her. But I didn't want to.
为什么  因为你想跟这个荡妇鬼混012---Well, why not? So you could spend your time with this tramp?
荡妇012---Tramp?
抱歉012---I'm sorry.
格林医生  蒙娜  蒙娜  格林医生012---Dr. Green, Mona. Mona, Dr. Green.
我不敢相信里面有个脱光衣服的妓女012---I can't believe there is a naked hooker in there!
或许她是妓女兼脱衣舞娘...012---Wait, wait. Maybe she's a hooker and a stripper...
但她会搞不清楚该做什么012---...but she got confused about what's she supposed to do.
有可能  技术上来说她确实脱光了衣服012---Could be. I mean, technically, she did strip.
只是我们错过了012---We just missed it.
小姐012---Ma'am?
你也是脱衣舞娘吗012---Are you also a stripper?
不是  但我可以假装  那得另外收钱012---No, but I can pretend to strip. But that's gonna cost extra.
这是另外收钱的项目  手拷  鞭打...012---Okay, here's the extras: Handcuffs, spanking...
或许莫妮卡是在跟你开玩笑012---Maybe Monica's playing a joke on you.
帮自己老公找妓女  那真的很好笑012---You know? Getting her own husband a hooker. That's pretty funny.
是很好笑  或许我生日的时候她会去杀人012---That is funny. Maybe for my birthday she'll murder someone.
我敢说罗斯也知情012---I'll bet Ross was in on it too.
他"刚好"很忙012---I mean, he was "conveniently" busy.
你不介意我抽烟吧012---Do you mind if I smoke in here?
你还是不要...012---Actually, I'd rather...
抽吧  反正我们也会烧掉那个房间012---Yeah, go ahead. We're gonna have to burn that room down anyway.
你为什么一直没有告诉我012---How could you have kept all this from me?
我打算告诉你  但是...012---I was going to tell you, but...
但是什么  你以为你可以得到你要的012---But what? You figure you'd get what you wanted,
然后像甩了瑞秋一样甩掉她012---then you'd dump her like you did Rachel.
我没有甩掉瑞秋  我们也没有在一起012---Hey, I did not dump Rachel. Nor are we still together.
我可以...012---Can I...?
让答录机接吧012---Why don't we just let the machine get that.
罗斯  我是乔伊  这里有个妓女012---Hey, Ross, it's Joey. There's a hooker over here...
我们想或许你知情012---...and we thought maybe you'd know something about it.
不012---No! No! No!
不  我需要躺一下012---No! I need to lie down.
今晚是单身汉派对之夜012---So, tonight's the night of the big bachelor party?
对  谢谢你给我那个女孩的电话号码012---Yeah. Thanks for giving me that girl's number.
别客气  这是给谁办的派对012---No problem. Say, who's the party for?
我老公  你帮你老公雇了一个妓女012--- For my husband.  You hired your husband a hooker?
她是脱衣舞娘  不  她是妓女012--- She's a stripper.  No, she's a hooker.
他们有时也这样称呼脱衣舞娘吗012---Is that what they call strippers sometimes?
因为她们本身就是妓女012---When they're hookers.
天啊  史都  我不敢相信你会这么做012---Oh, my God. Stu, I can't believe you did this.
你确定她是妓女吗012---Now, you're absolutely sure she's a hooker?
如果不是的话  那她就是我约过012---It's either that, or she's just the best,
技术最好  价钱最贵的女孩012---most expensive date I ever had.
或许她是故意帮你雇了个妓女012---Maybe she meant to get you a hooker.
她为什么要那么做012---Why would she do that?
或许她要你好好学一学012---Maybe she wants you to learn something.
你在床上有表现不好的方面吗012---Is there anything you're really bad at, you know, sexually?
这个单身汉派对简直烂到家了012---This is the worst bachelor party ever.
你们怎么那么久  再过一分钟就好012--- What's taking you boys so long?  In a minute!
"一分钟"  一分钟内会发生什么事012---"In a minute"? What's gonna happen in a minute?
好吧  或许你该去请她离开012---All right. Maybe you should ask her to leave.
为什么是我  这是你的单身汉派对012--- Why me?  Hey, it's your bachelor party.
所以应该是你去说012---Which is why you should do it.
我不要  你去012---I don't want to. You do it.
你去  你去012--- You do it.  You do it.
好吧  剪刀石头布012---All right. Rock, paper, scissors
决定谁去请那个妓女离开012---for who has to tell the whore to leave.
怎么了012---What?
我想念这种日子012---I miss this.
我觉得我们以前根本没做过这种事012---I don't think we've actually done this before.
不  我想念跟你鬼混的日子012---No, I miss hanging out with you.
我们还是混在一起  跟以前不一样了012--- We still hang out.  Not like we used to.
还记得吗  你跟我我们以前老是黏在一起012---Remember? You and me, we used to be inseparable.
现在一切都变得不一样了012---You know, now it's like things are different.
的确不一样了  我结婚了012---Well, you know, things are different. I'm married now.
别误会我  我为你们感到高兴012---And, hey, don't get me wrong, I am so happy for you guys.
我只是想念我们一起鬼混的日子  知道吗012---I just miss hanging out. Just us, you know?
我也是012---Yeah, I miss that too.
听我说  从现在开始012---I'll tell you what. From now on,
我们要找时间一起出去玩012---we'll make time to hang out with each other.
没问题  过来012---You got it. Come here.
天啊012---Oh, God.
听着  我差一点就要洗劫你们了012---Listen, I am this close to robbing you guys.
她是妓女  她是...012---She's a hooker! She's a hooker! She's a...
嗨  我们通过电话012---Hi. We spoke on the phone.
你爸到过我家012---So your dad dropped by.
他是个好人012---He's a pleasant man.
不  我得走了012--- Oh, no.  I better go.
我只是走到这里来  我不想错过吵架场面012---Just over here. I don't wanna miss the fight.
罗斯  我很抱歉012---Ross, I am so sorry.
我发誓明天我会亲自012---I promise, I will straighten this out
跟他把事情讲清楚012---with him tomorrow, in person.
或是通过电子邮件012---Or via email.
我不在乎你爸  我在乎蒙娜012---I don't care about your dad. I care about Mona.
当时她在场  都快气疯了012---She was there and now she's totally freaked out!
好吧  我也会跟她解释012---Okay, I'll fix that too.
告诉我她的电子邮件信箱  瑞秋012--- What's her email address?  Rachel.
我发誓我会解决的  我发誓我会跟她说012---All right, I promise, I'll fix this. I swear. I'll talk to her.
好吧  谢谢你012---Okay. Thank you.
就那样  这也算吵架啊012---That's it? You call that a fight?
"我们要分手了"  "不  我们没有"012---Come on. "We were on a break!" "No, we weren't!"
你们两个这是怎么了012---What happened to you two?
谢谢你答应回来012---Thank you so much for coming back over.
很好  你也在012---Oh, good. You're here.
我还担心今天过来会闹得不痛快012---And I was worried that it was going to be uncomfortable.
不  蒙娜  听我说012---No, Mona, just hear me out.
首先我很抱歉  我爸对你大叫012---First of all, I am so sorry about my father yelling at you.
但我听说你控制住了自己的脾气012---But I heard that you held your own.
你得告诉我你是怎么做到的012---You have to tell me how you did that.
说重点  好吧012--- Focus.  Okay.
罗斯跟我以前交往过012---Yes, Ross and I used to date.
我们的确有宝宝了012---And yes, we are gonna have a baby.
但我们绝对不可能复合012---But we are definitely not getting back together.
我怎么能相信你的话012---How can I be sure of that?
因为我们把彼此逼疯了012---Because we drove each other crazy.
他占有欲很强  爱吃醋012---He was possessive, he was jealous.
他从来都放不下那些小事012---He could never just let the little things go.
我还要跟这个女人交往呢012---Trying to date this woman.
但那都比不上他的温柔体贴012---None of that compared to how kind and gentle...
无微不至012---...and thoughtful he is.
或许你不该碰我012---You probably shouldn't touch me.
我不想介入这么复杂的事012---I don't wanna get in the middle of something so complicated.
我明白  但是蒙娜012---I get it, but, Mona,
哪段感情不复杂呢012---what relationship is not complicated?
我们都有自己的包袱  你也一样012---We all have our baggage. You must too.
不然你为什么还是单身呢012---Why else would you still be single?
我得走了012---I'm so gonna leave right now.
我应该为你把门开着吗012---Should I leave this open for you too?
我还不确定  你为什么不告诉我012---I'm not sure yet. Why didn't you just tell me about all this?
因为我跟瑞秋之间的事012---Because what's going on with Rachel
跟我对你的感觉没有关系012---has nothing to do with how I feel about you.
你还是应该告诉我012---You still should have told me.
我知道  我打算那么做012---I know, and I was going to, but...
但我想最好  还是让瑞秋的爸爸来告诉你012---I thought it was better that you heard it from Rachel's father.
我犯了个错误...012---I made a mistake...
但那是因为我真的很喜欢你  真的012---...but it's only because I really, really like you. Really.
好吧  我想你可以把门关上了012---Okay. I guess you can close the door now.
我忘了拿皮包  你们和好了012---Forgot my purse. Oh, you guys made up.
他是接吻高手  对吧  我这就闪012---He's a good kisser, isn't he? I'm going!
我发誓我不知道她是妓女012---I swear I didn't know she was a hooker.
你让她在这里抽烟了吗012---Did you let her smoke in here?
你奶奶的被单上还有她的屁股印子012---Her assprint is still on your grandmother's quilt.
你觉得抽烟的事是重点吗012---Do you really want to talk about smoking?
你知道吗  我要补偿你012---You know what, I'm gonna make this up to you.
我答应要帮你请脱衣舞娘...012---I promised you a stripper...
我一定会做到012---...and you're gonna get a stripper.
莫妮卡  等一下  怎么了012--- Monica, wait.  What?
继续012---Carry on.
这双网球鞋好紧012---These tennis shoes are so tight.
我想把它们脱掉  麻烦你别说话012--- I think I'll take them off.  Could you not narrate?
知道了  帅哥012---Gotcha, sailor.
就因为你不爱那个家伙...012---Just because you're not in love with the guy...
你跟你爸说实话了  大约一小时前012--- You told your dad the truth.  About an hour ago.
你想去看电影吗  好012--- Wanna go see a movie?  Yes.
再见  爸爸012---Bye, Dad.
我无法接受  爱跟结婚有什么关系012---It's unacceptable! What the hell does love have to do with it?
还有比爱更重要的事012---There are more important things than love.
你得考虑宝宝012---You have to think about the baby.
你得想想  你做的决定会有什么后果012---You have to think about the consequences of your decisions!
我的确会想我做的决定会有什么后果012---Hey, I do think about the consequences of my decisions!
你有什么权利...012---Well, what gives you the right to...?
去死吧012---Go to hell!
蠢男人敢打我家电话012---Stupid guy on my phone.
瑞秋  你知道怀孕的时候...012---Rach, listen. Did you know that during pregnancy...
你的手指会肿成两倍粗012---...your fingers swell up to twice their size
而且再也不会消了吗012---and never go back?
天啊  让我看看012---Oh, my God! Let me see that.
你每次都会上当012---You fall for it every time.
我把我的旧孕妇装拿来给你012---Hey! I brought you my old maternity clothes.
菲比  你真是太贴心了012---Oh, Pheebs, that's so sweet.
好可爱哦  是啊012--- Oh, those are so cute!  Yes.
你看  宝宝越长越大 它们也会跟着撑开来012---Look. See how they expand as the baby grows?
宝宝出生后012---And then after the baby's born
可以穿它去偷西瓜012---they're great for shoplifting melons.
太好了  你们都在  感恩节  明天四点012---Good, you're all here. Okay. Thanksgiving, tomorrow, 4:00.
你猜我邀请了谁012---Guess who I invited?
还记得高中同学威尔·卡佛特吗012---Remember Will Culvert from high school?
不记得了  他跟罗斯同班012--- No.  He was in Ross' class.
他是军乐队的  有点胖012---Marching band, was kind of overweight.
他是个大胖子012---Really overweight.
我属于他的苗条朋友012---I was his thin friend.
我不记得他了012---I don't remember him.
你确定你说的不是你假想的男朋友吗012---Are you sure you're not talking about your imaginary boyfriend?
不  那是贾拉德012---No, that was Jared.
我好久没有想起他了012---Haven't thought about him in a long time.
威尔来城里出差012---Anyway, Will's here on business,
他没地方可去  所以我邀请他过来012---and he didn't have a place to go, so I invited him here.
那很好啊  他减肥成功了012--- That's nice.  Oh, he's lost a bunch of weight.
他看起来很不错  他真的是帅呆了012---He looks good. Okay, I mean really gorgeous.
我还爱着钱德勒012---I still love Chandler.
偶尔提一次不会要你的命012---Wouldn't hurt you to say it once in a while.
先说好了  今年我不烤火鸡012---Just so you know, I'm not gonna make a turkey this year...
什么  菲比不吃火鸡012--- What?  Phoebe doesn't eat turkey.
菲比  火鸡是漂亮聪明的动物012--- Phoebe!  Turkeys are beautiful, intelligent animals.
不是的  它们既丑又蠢  但很好吃012---No, they're not! They're ugly and stupid and delicious!
不只是菲比  威尔还在节食012---It's not just Phoebe.Will's still on a diet,
钱德勒不吃感恩节食物...012---Chandler doesn't eat Thanksgiving food...
瑞秋对家禽类反胃  是吗012--- Rachel's having her aversion to poultry.  She is?
对  记得吗  那天你吃烤鸡时012---Yeah. Remember? I had to leave the other day
我不得不走开012---when you had that roast chicken.
我还以为是因为我把烧鸡套在手上012---Yeah. I thought that was because I put the whole thing on my hand
让它在桌子上走路012---and made it walk across the table.
为了三个人做一只火鸡太不划算了012---It's not worth it to make a whole turkey for just three people.
那真的很费功夫012---It's a lot of work.
但感恩节一定要吃火鸡啊012---But you gotta have turkey on Thanksgiving!
感恩节不吃火鸡012---I mean, Thanksgiving with no turkey is like
就像国庆日不吃苹果派012---Fourth of July with no apple pie.
或是星期五不吃两个披萨012---Or Friday with no two pizzas.
如果真的对你那么重要的话我就做012---Fine, if it means that much to you.
但到时候一定会剩下很多012---But there's gonna be a ton left over.
不  我发誓我会把整只火鸡吃完012---No, there won't. I promise I will finish that turkey.
你是说你可以一次吃掉012---You're telling me you can eat almost
一整只火鸡012---an entire turkey in one sitting?
没错  因为我是崔比亚尼家的人012---That's right. Because I'm a Tribbiani!
这是我们的专长012---This is what we do.
我们不是伟大的思想家或世界领袖...012---We may not be great thinkers or world leaders...
我们书念得不多  跑得不快012---...we don't read a lot or run fast,
但我们绝对是大胃王012---but damn it, we can eat!
《老友记》  第八季  第9集  谣言012---Friends S08E09 The One With The Rumor

明年桌边会坐一个宝宝012---Isn't it weird to think about how next year there this time
感觉很奇怪吧012---there will be a baby at the table?
我是指瑞秋的孩子012---Rachel's.
但我很高兴知道你的真实想法012---But good to know where you're at.
感恩节快乐  你也是012--- Happy Thanksgiving.  You too!
需要我帮忙吗  好啊012--- Anything I can do to help?  Actually there is.
通常钱德勒会帮忙 但他看球赛看得正入迷012---Chandler usually helps me with this, but he's really into the game
我不想打扰他012---so I don't want to bother him.
麻烦你帮忙折餐巾吧  没问题012--- Could you help me to fold these napkins?  Sure.
我要去对面看看地瓜泥好了没  好012--- I'm gonna go across the hall to check on the yams.  Okay.
不  亲爱的  不是那样折012---No, sweetie. No, not like that.
我们不是在办农场舞会012---We're not at a barn dance.
要把它们折成天鹅的形状012---You've gotta fold them like swans.
我在圣诞节时教过你  记得吗012---Like I showed you at Christmas. Remember?
记得  一切历历在目012---Yeah, it all just came screaming back to me.
球赛好看吗  我不知道012--- So how's the game?  I have no idea.
什么  我假装看球赛012--- What?  Yeah, I'm just pretending to watch the game
那样子就不必帮忙012---...so I don't have to help out with stuff.
我不敢相信012---I don't believe you!
这招太高明了012---That is brilliant!
莫妮卡没发觉吗  对012--- And Monica has no idea?  No.
偶尔我会对着电视大叫012---Every once and a while, I just scream stuff at the TV.
怎么回事012---Hey! What? Aw! Hey!
你的球队赢了吗  安德森刚刚又得分了012--- Your team winning, hon?  Yeah. Anderson just scored again.
根本就没有安德森这号人物012---There is no Anderson.
我也想如法炮制  莫妮卡012---I wanna get in on this. Hey, Mon?
看来我没办法帮你了012---I don't think I can help you after all.
我不知道今天会播这场球赛012---I didn't realize this game was on.
没听说你喜欢橄榄球  我平时不喜欢012--- I don't know you like football.  Normally, I don't.
但今天是绿湾队在比赛012---But, you know, Green Bay is playing.
你喜欢绿湾队  那是我最喜欢的海湾012--- You like Green Bay?  It's only my favorite bay.
感恩节快乐012---Happy Thanksgiving.
谢谢  威尔  我很高兴你能来012---Thanks. Will, I'm so glad that you came.
你看起来帅呆了  你一定减掉了012---You look great. You must've lost like...
150磅012---150 pounds.
我会是赛百味三明治广告的下一号人选012---I'll be on one of those Subway sandwich commercials.
是派  零脂肪  无糖  也没有奶012--- A pie!  It's no fat, it's no sugar, it's no dairy.
一点都不好吃  丢了吧012---It's no good. Throw it out.
我来介绍你们认识012---You wanna meet some people.
这是我丈夫钱德勒  这是威尔012---This is my husband, Chandler. Chandler, this is Will.
我很想跟你握手  但我忙着看球赛012---Oh, hey. I'd shake your hand but I'm really into the game.
而且如果我们两个不站在一起012---Plus, I think it'd be better for my ego
我的自尊就不会那么受伤012---if we didn't stand right next to each other.
这是菲比012---This is Phoebe.
干得好012---Well done.
你要帮我吗  好012--- Wanna give me a hand?  Sure.
莫妮卡  我真的觉得你很漂亮012---Monica, I can't get over how great you look. You look stunning.
你也很帅  你身材真棒012---You look incredible too. You're so fit.
虽说我在看球赛  但我没聋012---I'm watching the game, but I'm not deaf.
我一直想告诉你  罗斯也会来012---I meant to tell you, Ross is coming.
太棒了  我喜欢罗斯012---Ross is coming. Great, I love Ross.
很好  瑞秋·格林也会来012---Good. And Rachel Greene too.
有问题吗  没有  没关系的012--- Is there a problem?  No. It's okay.
只是...天啊  我恨她012---It's just... God, I hated her.
什么  我恨她012--- What?  Yeah. I hated her.
高中时她对我很差劲012---She was horrible to me in high school.
但那是很久以前的事了012---But hey, that was a long time ago.
我现在一切都好  或许再见到她会很有趣012---I'm in a good place. Might be fun to see her again.
你有蛋糕或饼干什么的吗012---Got any cakes or cookies or something?
不行  威尔  不行012---No, Will! No!
我们很久没大叫了  或许我们该叫一下012---It's been a while since we screamed. Maybe we should.
好吧  不要啊  加油012--- Oh, okay. No!  Come on!
该死的裁判  下地狱去吧012---Damn you, ref! You burn in hell!
你这是要干嘛012---What are you doing?

让我跟你解释一下人体的运作原理012---Let me explain to you how the human body works.

吃薯片像是在做拉筋运动  好吧012--- Eating chips is like stretching.  Okay.
别担心  崔比亚尼永远吃不饱012---Don't worry, Tribbianis never get full.
我知道你的意思012---I actually know what you're talking about.
我要告诉你一件事012---I'm here to tell you something, friend.
你可以吃个不停  但你无法填满内心的空虚012---You can eat and eat, but nothing will ever fill that void.
这家伙到底是谁012---Who the hell is this guy?
他是我们的高中同学威尔  他是乔伊012---This is Will, from high school. This is Joey.
威尔  罗斯012--- Will!  Ross!
你来了012---Hey, you came!
天啊  你看起来棒极了  大帅哥012---Man, you look incredible! Hot stuff!
大帅哥  很高兴能见到你012--- Hot stuff ?  It's good to see you, man.
我也是  你是做哪一行的012---Yeah. You too. So, what are you up to?
我是期货经纪人  听起来很有趣012--- I'm a commodities broker.  Really? That sounds interesting.
才怪012---Yeah, it's not.
但我现在既有钱  身材又好012---But I'm rich and thin.
自从兰西戴维斯的毕业派对之后我就没有见过你012---I haven't seen you since Lance Davis' graduation party.
那一晚真的很疯狂012---That was such a fun night.
如果我们都有被邀请就好了 但还是很疯狂012---Would've been good if we had gotten in, but still real fun.
那时我们逊毙了012---We were lame back then.
你还记得我们当时多迷恐龙吗012---Do you remember how into dinosaurs we were?
对  你是做哪一行的012--- Yeah.  So, what do you do now?
你要在城里待多久012---So how long are you in town?

天啊  罗斯  我恨她012---God, I hate her, Ross! I hate her!
高中是很久以前的事了012---Will, high school was a long time ago.

他真的越来越性感了012---Wow, really got that sexy smoldering thing going on.
天啊  看他盯着我瞧的样子012---Oh, my God. Look at the way he's just staring at me.
他好像想用唇语跟我说话  但看不出说的什么012---He's trying to mouth something to me, but I can't make it out.
我恨你012---I hate you!
好了  晚餐准备好了  好吧012--- Okay, dinner's ready!  Okay!

你是威尔吧  对012--- Hi! Will, right?  Right.
我是瑞秋·格林012---Right, hi. I'm Rachel Greene.
我记得你  真的吗  你真好012--- Oh, I remember you.  Really? aren't you sweet?
我得告诉你  我真的很难记得你的样子012---I gotta tell you though, I'm having the hardest time placing you.
等一下  我想我记得你012---Hang on! I think I remember you.
我们...012---Did we...
我们在兰西戴维斯的毕业派对上鬼混过吗012---Did we fool around at Lance Davis' graduation party?
你真是不可思议  谢谢你012--- You are unbelievable.  Thank you.
瑞秋  你坐这边  威尔  你坐到那边去012---Rachel? Why don't you sit here? And Will, you sit way over there.
就那样012---That's it?
即使没有人帮我  我也可以吃掉它012---Even if nobody helps me, I can eat that.
没问题  至少给我一点挑战012---No problem. At least give me a challenge.
这是钱德勒的鸡肉012---This is Chandler's chicken.
这才是火鸡012---This is the turkey.
这有多大012---How big is that?
大约19磅012---About 19 pounds.
它跟我刚出生时差不多大012---It's like me when I was born.
谁想吃地瓜泥  威尔012---Alright. Who would like some yams? Will?
你喜欢那样做  对吧012---You'd like that, wouldn't you?
什么  拜托把鸡肉...012---What? Oh, you know what, can we please keep the chicken...
跟火鸡放到另一边去012---...and the turkey and everything on the other side of the table?
那个味道真的恶心  太典型了012--- The smell is just...  Typical.
什么  我说那太典型了012--- I'm sorry. What?  I said it was typical.
瑞秋·格林的典型作风012---Typical of you. Rachel Green.
瑞秋女王在瑞秋王国想做什么就做什么012---Queen Rachel does whatever she wants in Rachelland.
说真的  这家伙是谁012---Seriously, who is this guy?
抱歉  你对我有意见吗012---Sorry, do you have a problem with me?
我不知道  我有吗012---I don't know. Do I? Do I?
我想你有012---I think you do.
你在高中时对他有点恶劣012---Apparently, You were a little mean to him in high school.
有点恶劣  你让我活在痛苦深渊012---A little mean? You made my life miserable.
我不知道  抱歉012---I had no idea. I'm sorry.
你应该抱歉  去他的012---Well, you should be. Screw it.
把地瓜泥拿过来给我012---Bring on the yams.
威尔  但你很努力在减肥012---Will, but you worked so hard.
地瓜泥  好的012--- Yams!  Okay.
不论在高中时  我对你做了什么012---Will, I just want to say that I'm real sorry
我都非常抱歉012---for whatever I did to you in high school.
不只是我  我们组了一个社团012---It wasn't just me. We had a club.
你们组了一个社团012---You had a club?
没错  "我恨瑞秋·格林社"012---That's right. The "I Hate Rachel Greene Club"!
天啊  你们全都聚在一起恨我吗012---My god. So you all just joined together to hate me?
还有谁加入了那个社团  我跟罗斯012--- Who else was in this club?  Me and Ross.
你不必指我  她知道罗斯是谁012---No need to point. She knows who Ross is.
你加入了"我恨瑞秋社"  没错012--- You were in an "I Hate Rachel" club?  Yes, he was.
不要012---No, no.
还有谁参加了你们的社团012---So who else was in this club?
那个来自泰国的交换学生012---Actually, there was also that exchange student from Thailand
但我想他不知道那是怎么一回事012---but I don't think he knew what it was.
罗斯  我们交往了两年...012---So, Ross, we went out for two years...
你没有告诉我你参加过"我恨瑞秋社"012---...and you never told me you were in an "I Hate Rachel Club"?
你跟她交往过  我们说好的012---You went out with her? We had a pact.
那是高中的事了  又不是永久的约定012---It was in high school. It's not like it was binding forever.
那为什么里面有"永远"这个字眼012---Then why did it have the word eternity in it?
莫妮卡  你知道这件事吗012---Monica? Did you know about this?
我发誓不知道012---I swear I didn't.
所以你们才会常把房门锁上吗012---Is that why you used to lock the bedroom door?
对  我得说我松了一口气012--- Yeah.  A little relieved, I gotta say.
听着  瑞秋  我很抱歉  好吗012---Look, Rach, I'm sorry, okay?
那时我是个愚蠢的孩子012---I was a stupid kid, okay?
我会加入社团是因为...  是一起成立012--- The only reason I joined...  Cofounded.
一起成立012---Cofounded.
我一起成立那个社团是因为我那时疯狂地爱着你012---Cofounded the club, was that I was insanely in love with you.
显然我处理得不够好012---Obviously I didn't handle it very well.
但如果你仔细想想012---If you think about it,
"我恨瑞秋社"其实是"我爱瑞秋社"012---the "I Hate Rachel Club" was really the "I Love Rachel Club."
但它真的是"我恨瑞秋社"012---Except that it was really the "I Hate Rachel Club."
难道你们就聚到一起说我的坏话吗012---Okay. So you'd get together and like just say mean things about me?
不只是那样  没有没有012--- We did a little more than that.  No, no, no.
你们还做了什么012---What else did you do?
我们散布一个谣言  什么谣言012--- We started a rumor.  What rumor?
快点  威尔  脱掉上衣  告诉我们012---Come on, Will, just take off your shirt and tell us.
罗斯  那真的没什么012--- Ross?  It was no big deal.
我们说...012---We said that...
那个谣言是...012---The rumor was that...
你同时有男性跟女性的生殖器官012---...you had both male and female reproductive parts.
什么  没错  我们说你爸妈012--- What?  That's right. We said your parents...
丢铜板决定把你当成女孩养大012---...flipped a coin, decided to raise you as a girl,
但你还是有小鸡鸡012---but you still had a hint of a penis.
天啊  那是你们编的012--- Oh, my God!  You started that?
你也听过  我们学校里每个人都听过012--- What? You heard that?  Everyone at our school heard it!
我的学校里每个人都听过012---Everyone at my school heard it.
你就是那个长岛的双性啦啦队员012---You were the hermaphrodite cheerleader from Long Island?
不012---Oh, no!
现在我终于懂了012---Oh my God! This is all making so much sense to me now!
所以亚当·卡特不想跟我约会012---This is why Adam Can'ter wouldn't go out with me.
为什么比利·特雷特只想对这块区域下手012---This is why Billy Tratt would just stay in this region!
比利·特雷特成了男同志012---Actually, Billy Tratt is gay now,
所以那不是我们的错012---so that one's not really our fault.
莫妮卡  你为什么不告诉我012---Monica, how come you never told me this?
我想或许那是真的012---I thought it might be true.
我担心你会大哭把它掏出来给我看012---I was afraid that you were gonna cry and then show it to me.
乔伊别看了  那里面没有东西012---Joey, stop staring! There's nothing there!
那不是真的012---It's not true!
恐怕我需要证据012---I'm afraid I'm gonna need proof.
你是我的珠穆朗玛峰012---You are my Everest.
你不必吃完它012---Joey, you don't have to finish that.
我必须吃完  不然接下来会怎样012---Yes, I do. Otherwise, what's next?
今天我吃不完一只火鸡012---Today I’m just a guy who can't finish a turkey,
明天我只能吃一半的三明治012---but tomorrow I'm the guy who eats half a Powerbar,
把剩下的部分包起来放在冰箱  不行012---...wrap it up and put it in the fridge? No!
我得去换条裤子012---I just... I just gotta change my pants.
我在想什么  牛仔裤根本没有伸缩性012---What was I thinking? Jeans have no give.
好了012---Okay, okay.
你们看史恩·麦马洪在我的纪念册上写了什么012---Listen to what Sean McMahon wrote in my yearbook senior year.
"亲爱的瑞秋  你真是个好人"012---"Dear Rach, you're such a great person."
不是女孩  是"人"012---Not girl, "person."
瑞秋  我觉得你太敏感了012---Rach, I think you're reading a little too much into it.
"亲爱的瑞秋  你是个好人012---"Dear Rach. You're a great person.
关于你有小鸡鸡的事我很遗憾"012---Sorry about your teeny weenie."
你要我怎么做012---What do you want me to do...
你要我打电话给全校的人012---I want me to call everyone in the entire school
告诉他们那不是真的012---and tell them it wasn't true?
对  可以顺便告诉他们我变瘦了吗012--- Yes.  Could you also tell them I'm skinny now?
还有我012---Oh! Me too!
我不会打电话给任何人012---Look, I won't call anybody.
那是很久以前的事了012---It was a million years ago.
我不在乎那是多久之前的事了012---I don't care how long ago it was.
你们告诉大家我是双性人012---You told people that I was half and half!
我要说明一点012---You know what? I just want to point out
在高中  我没做过任何伤害你的事012---I never did anything to hurt you in high school.
那不完全是真的012---That's not totally true.
什么  什么012--- What?  What?
你告诉大家罗斯012---You did start that rumor about Ross...
跟50岁大的图书馆员亚特曼太太亲热012---...making out with Mrs. Altmann, our 50yearold librarian.
你怎么知道那件事012---How did you know that?
那是真的  不是012--- It's true?  No.
是真的  我看到你们躲在书卡柜的后面012---Yes, it is. I saw you guys going at it behind the card catalog.

她看起来不像50岁012---Hey, she didn't look 50!
她看起来像16岁吗012---Did she look 16?
事实上纪念册里有她的照片012---There's a picture of her in the yearbook actually.
哇  她不太上相012--- Wow.  She didn't photograph well!
大概是因为大半辈子都坐着当油画模特012---She probably wasn't familiar with the process
她不太熟悉照相的方法技巧012---having spent most of her life sitting for oil paintings.
这件事是怎么发生的012---How did this happen?
她勾引你去吃早鸟晚餐吗012---Did she lure you to an earlybird dinner? 
有一天下午我在图书馆里看书看到很晚012---I was working late in the library one afternoon.
馆里只有我们两个人012---It was just the two of us.
她需要人帮忙玩填字游戏012---She needed some help with her word jumble.

我得告诉你们012---If you must know,
安妮塔非常仁慈温柔012---Anita was very gentle and tender.
希望她能得到安息012---May she rest in peace.
她不是柱着拐杖走路吗012---Did't she walk with a cane?
只有在天气潮湿的时候012---Only when it was damp!
我不敢相信你把这件事告诉了大家012---I can't believe you told people about this.
大家都知道吗012---Everybody knew?
好了  我要重回社团  耶012--- You know what? I'm back in the club!  Yeah!
我要加入  菲比012--- I wanna join!  Phoebe?
抱歉  我从来没有加入过社团012---I'm sorry, but I never got to be in a club.
我没有念过高中012---I didn't go to high school.
但我们三个可以躲在垃圾箱后面学法文012---But three of us would meet behind a dumpster to learn French.
你好012---Bonjour.
好吧  你们可以继续那个愚蠢的小社团012---Fine, you can have your stupid, little club.
但我要说  你对我做的事012---but I would just like to say is what you did to me
比我对你做的事更糟糕012---is way worse than what I did to you!
你说我有小鸡鸡  对012--- You gave me a teeny weenie.  Yeah!
听我说012---Alright, listen.
你真的太傻了  瑞秋  即使有那个谣言012---You're just being silly. Rachel, even with that rumor...
你还是学校里最受欢迎的女生之一012---...you were one of the most popular girls in school.

有个女孩太想变得跟你一样012---One girl wanted to be like you so much,
她甚至往裤档里塞棒条糖012---she stuffed her pants with a Tootsie Roll.
罗斯  要不是她的谣言012---And Ross, if it weren't for Rachel's rumor,
学校里没有人会知道你是谁012---no one in high school would've even known who you were.
是她让你成名012---She put you on the map.
以老女人的情人成名012---As a romancer of the elderly.
可以看得出来012---Mrs. Altman was the kind of woman
亚特曼太太年轻的时候很漂亮012---you could tell she used to be pretty.
她的眼睛光芒不减当年012---The eyes did still sparkle.
这都是陈年往事了012---Guys, this stuff is so way in the past.
从那之后你们也经历过很多事012---You've been through so much since then.
你们未来的生活012---And right now, you got so much more important stuff

你搞大她的肚子  但却不娶她  兄弟012---So you knocked her up but you're not gonna marry her. Dude.
有人要来吗  好吧012--- Anybody?  Okay.
跟我想像中的感觉完全一样012---It's exactly how I imagined it would be.
好吧  火鸡在哪里012---All right, where's that turkey?
那是我的孕妇裤012---Joey, those are my maternity pants!
不  这是我的感恩节裤012---No, these are my Thanksgiving pants!

我相信总统随时会致来贺电012---I believe we can expect a call from the president any moment now.
有什么我们可以帮忙的吗012---Anything we can do for you?
不必了  但千万别压我的胃012---No. Just nobody press on my stomach.
还有  那条裤子你不用还了012---You can keep those pants, by the way.
那是什么  那是派吗012---What you got there? What is that, pie?

你觉得如何012---So, what do you think?
新发型  项链  裙子012---New haircut? Necklace? Dress?
靴子  靴子012---Boots? Boots!
比我平常买的靴子贵一点  也比租的贵012---Now, they're a little more than I usually spend on boots. Or rent.
我的天啊012---Oh, my God.
我知道012---I know.
我会怀念温饱的日子012---I'll miss being able to afford food.
对不起  它们真的很漂亮012---I'm sorry. They just looked so good.
专柜小姐的表情像是在说012---The saleswoman was looking at me like:
"这些靴子大贵了  你买不起"012---"These are too expensive for you."
很有道理012---She had a point.
莫妮卡  这双靴子好漂亮哦012---Oh, Monica, those boots are amazing.
这是我的012---They're mine!
很遗憾我们得退回去012---Too bad we're gonna have to return them.
退回去  靴子听得见你说话012---Return them? They're gonna hear you.

我会一直跟你玩012---And I'm gonna play with you all the time.
你怎么能让他对着你的胯下说话012---How can you let him talk to your crotch like that?
他是在跟宝宝说话  原来如此012--- He's talking to the baby.  Oh! Okay.
好吧  因为当他说012---Okay, because when he said,
"我等不及要听到你说第一句话"012---"I can't wait for your first words"...
我想"这招不错"012---...I thought, "There's a trick."
我得走了  待会见012---Well, I gotta go, you guys. I'll see you later.

你的任务还没完成吧012---I don't think you did a very thorough job.
我把他送回卡罗尔家了012---I dropped him off at Carol's.
总之  我没有要到门票012---Anyway, it turns out I'm not gonna get those tickets, though.
不是吧  为什么012---Oh, no. Why not?
结果本跟史汀的儿子处得不好012---It turns out Ben and Sting's son do not get along.
怎么会呢012---How come?
很明显  史汀的儿子取笑012---Apparently, Sting's son made fun of the fact that
本的妈妈们是女同志012---Ben's moms are "lesbenims."
等一下  如果他们处不好012---Wait, Ross. If they don't get along,
那你应该帮他们劝和012---then you should smooth things over.
让他们做好朋友012---Make them be friends.
你不能逼孩子们做朋友  当然可以012--- Phoebe, you can't force kids to be friends.  Sure you can.
给他们一些积木  让他们在游戏床里玩012---Give them some blocks. Put them in a playpen.
游戏床  本都七岁了  七岁了012--- Playpen? Ben's 7.  Your kid is 7?
他个头好小哦012---He's really small.
拜托你去要门票012---Please get the tickets.
抱歉  菲比  我办不到012---I'm sorry, Pheebs. I just can't do it.
不  你可以  史汀亲口说过012---Yes, you can. Sting says so himself.
什么  罗斯可以012--- What?  Ross can.
听着  我很抱歉012---Look, I'm sorry...
罗斯可以012---Ross can.
菲比  罗斯可以帮我要到门票012--- Phoebe?  Ross can get me the tickets.
罗斯可以帮我要到门票012---Ross can get me the tickets.
她来了  未来的流行界超级巨星012---Here she is: Future fashion superstar.
乔伊  我还算不上...  我妹妹蒂娜012--- Oh, Joey, I'm hardly...  My little sister Dina.
蒂娜  很高兴见到你  嗨012--- Hi, Dina. Nice to meet you.  Hi.
谢谢你答应见我012---Thanks so much for meeting with me.
乔伊告诉我很多关于你的事012---Joey's told me so much about you.
她好兴奋哦012---This is so exciting for her.
我让你们两个"流行大师"012---Well, I'll let you two "fashists"
坐下来好好谈正事012---get down to business.
好吧  蒂娜012---Okay. All right, Dina.
我们来谈谈  你可以考虑的012---Well, let's talk about the different areas of fashion...
服装界的不同领域012---...that you could get involved in.
让我看看  有设计部门012---Let's see, there's design.
但那得需要相关文凭012---But you may need a whole other degree for that.
销售部门不错  你可以旅行012---There's sales which is great, because you get to travel.
我不在乎流行服装012---I don't care about fashion.
我怀孕了  我知道你也是  你得帮帮我012---I'm pregnant. And I know you are too, so you gotta help me.
还有行销部门012---Then there's marketing.
怎么了  没事  我只是在打哈欠012--- What's wrong?  Nothing. I just was yawning.
别忘了今晚我公司要办派对012---Don't forget, my office holiday party's tonight.
我们今晚不一定要去  对吧012---Honey, we don't really have to go to this thing, do we?
我知道你不喜欢参加我公司的派对012---Sweetie, I know that you don't like my office parties,
但你可以穿你的新靴子012---but you can wear your new boots.
看吧  每件事都有它好的一面012---See? Every cloud has a supple leather lining.
今晚我不想穿靴子  为什么012--- I don't wanna wear the boots tonight.  Why not?
我担心你老板看到以后012---Well, you know. I'm worried your bosses will see them
会觉得他们给你的薪水太高了012---and think they pay you too much money.
或是你的助理看到以后会要求加薪012---Or your assistant will see them and want a raise.
你以为我是在帮靴子订价的公司上班吗012---Do you think I work some kind of bootpricing company?
我已经挑好了我要穿的衣服012---I picked out this outfit I wanna wear,
靴子跟它不配012---and the boots don't go with it.
你说过这双靴子物有所值012---You said that you paid all that money
因为可以搭配短裙  连衣裙跟长裤012---because those boots go with skirts, dresses, and pants!
好吧  你要我穿靴子我就穿嘛012---Fine. If you want me to, I'll wear the boots.
事实上我要到卧室去试穿我的衣服012---In fact, I'll go into my room right now and try the outfit on.
穿着我的靴子参加圣诞节派对012---Christmas party in my boots!
我不能进去  我不敢告诉他012---I can't go in there. I can't tell him.
一定会没事的012---It's gonna be okay.
他一直都非常支持我012---He has been incredibly supportive of me.
如果他大发脾气012---And if he gets a little upset,
快把肉饼赛百味三明治拿给他012---that's what the meatball sub is for.
谢谢  好吧012--- Thank you.  Okay.
我的流行界女王们回来了012---Hey! It's my fashion girls.
怎么了  你为什么不坐下呢012--- What's wrong?  Why don't you sit down.
蒂娜有件事想告诉你012---Dina has something that she wants to tell you.
发生了什么事  是妈妈吗  她生病了吗012---What's going on? Is it Mom? Is she sick?
是爸爸的心脏出问题了吗012---Is it Dad's heart?
那是三明治吗012---Is that a sandwich?
妈妈跟爸爸没事  那是三明治吗012--- Joe, Mom and Dad are fine.  Is that a sandwich?!
乔伊  有件事你得知道012---Joey, there's something that you should know.
蒂娜012---Dina?
我怀孕了  什么012--- I'm pregnant.   What?
快给他三明治  给他三明治012---Now. Give him the sandwich! Give him the sandwich!
很明显  这是个误会  你不可能怀孕012---Obviously, this is a mistake. You can't be pregnant.
因为你得先做爱才会怀孕012---Because you have to have sex to get pregnant.
乔伊  我试着学你一样等到25岁再尝禁果012---Joe, I tried to wait until I was 25, like you did.
什么  蒂娜...012---What? Dina...
我不敢相信  你是个好孩子012---I can't believe this. You're the good one.
你念过大学  还念了两年012---You went to college! Both years!
是谁干的012---Who did this to you?
巴比·科索  但他是个很好的人012---Bobby Corso. But he's a real nice guy.
我很喜欢他  他很好笑012---I like him a lot. He's real funny.
你因为"好笑"而怀孕012---You got pregnant for "funny"?
蒂娜  如果他很好笑  你只要笑就行了012---Dina, if he's funny, laugh!
我马上回来  你留在这里012---I'll be back in a little while. You stay here!
为什么  你要去哪里012---Why? Where you going?
我现在没法直视你012---I can't look at you right now.
我知道012---I know.
你在这里啊  本012---Oh, there you are, Ben.
菲比阿姨  你来这里做什么012---Aunt Phoebe, what are you doing here?
我听说你跟班里的一个男生012---Well, I heard you're having a problem
相处得不太好012---with one of the boys in your class.
所以我就想过来  让你们坐下来012---So I thought I'd come down here and sit you both down,
好好地谈一谈  把问题解决掉012---have a little talk and make it all okay.
那个孩子叫做史汀的儿子012---Now, the boy's name is Sting's son.
杰克  我恨他  他是个混蛋012---Jack? I hate him. He's a jerk.
本  有时候人们外表看起来像是混蛋012---Now, Ben. Sometimes people may seem like jerks on the outside...
但他们有个名人爸爸012---...but they have famous fathers.
我得走了  我朋友道格在等我012---I have to go. My friend Doug is waiting for me over there.
你就跟这种孩子做朋友012---Him, you're friends with.
对不起  需要我帮忙吗012---Excuse me, can I help you with something?
对  我在找杰克的父母012---Yes. I'm looking for Jack's parents.
你是家长吗  我来找本012--- Are you with one of the students?  I'm with Ben.
你是本的妈妈012---Are you one of Ben's mothers?
我是本的妈妈012---I am one of Ben's mothers.
我是女同志012---I'm a lesbian.
我爸妈很难接受这种事012---It was difficult coming out to my parents.
我是珍妮·布恩  新来的老师012---Well, hi. I'm Jenny Boon. I'm a new teacher here.
我只见过你的另一半卡罗尔012---I've only met your partner, Carol.
那么我就是苏珊012---That would make me Susan.
对  你要找杰克父母012---Right. Are you looking for Jack's parents
讨论他跟本的问题吗012---to discuss his problems he's having with Ben?
是啊  我觉得父母们012---Yeah, because I really do think the parents
应该坐下来好好谈一谈012---should sit down together and have a conversation.
对  我们就那么办吧012---Yeah, let's do that!
听起来很不错012---That sounds good.
我们应该坐下来谈一谈012---We should sit down and talk.
我和爱人卡罗尔跟史汀夫妇012---Just me, my lover, Carol, and the Stings.
我要怎么联络他们012---How will I get in touch with them?
联络簿上有他们的电话号码012---Their number's on the contact sheet.
能给我一份吗012---Could I get a copy of that?
卡罗尔把它丢了  她弄丢了我们的联络簿012---Carol threw it out. She lost ours.
她真的很糊涂012---She's such a scatterbrain.
但天啊  她的屁股真是火辣性感012---But, man, what a hot piece of ass.
那场派对还不错012---You know, that party wasn't bad.
对  我不知道还有舞会012---Yeah. I didn't know there'd be dancing.
那真是个大惊喜012---That was a fun surprise.
我看不到计程车  或许我们该走回家012---I don't see a cab. Maybe we should walk.
不  我们不能走路012---No, we can't walk.
离地铁站只有15条街远  来吧012---It's 15 blocks to the subway. Come on.
你觉得我们可以从那个下水道孔012---Do you think we can get to the subway right there
直接爬到地铁站里吗012---if we climb through that manole cover?
什么事不对劲吗012---What's going on?
我走不动了  好吗012---I can't walk, okay?
买这双靴子是个天大的错误  什么012--- These boots were a huge mistake.  What?
你说得对  我不该买下来012---Okay, you were right. I never should have bought them.
害我的脚好痛  我的脚趾快断了012---They're killing me, one toe at a time.
我说得对  原来"对了"就是这种感觉012---So I was right. This is what it feels like to be right.
我为什么觉得很不安012---It's oddly unsettling.
我们要怎么回家  背着走吧012---How are we gonna we get home? Maybe a piggyback ride?
来吧  好吧  等一下012--- Hop on.  Okay, wait, just give me a second.
我先把靴子脱掉012---Let me just get my boots off first.
天啊012---Oh, God.
亲爱的  我知道你很痛012---Honey, I know you're in pain right now,
但我却来了性致012---but I'm a little turnedon.
你会不会担心走路的时候012---Do you ever worry that you'll be walking
宝宝会掉出来012---and your baby will just slip out?
你念的哪所大学  蒂娜012---What college was that, Dina?
天啊  巴比012---Oh, my God. Bobby?
蒂娜  很高兴能见到你012---Hi, Dina. Good to see you.
乔伊  你在做什么012---Joey, what are you doing?
我只是在做我该做的事012---Just what needs to be done.
亲爱的亲友们  我们齐聚一堂012---Dearly beloved, we're gathered here...
乔伊  这太疯狂了012---Joey, this is crazy.
我在跟上帝说话  别打断我012---Don't interrupt me when I'm talking to God!
我们说到哪里了012---Where were we?
你  蒂娜  愿意嫁这个人...  不012--- Right, okay. Do you Dina take this man...?  No!
你得嫁他  不  我不会嫁012--- You'll take him.  No, I won't!
这可由不得你  不  我就愿意这样012--- You don't get a say in this.  Yes, I do.
我听到了"我愿意"  已经完成一半012---I heard "I do." We're halfway there.
再来是你012---Okay. You.
好吧  乔伊  够了012---All right, Joey, that is enough!
虽然这个婚礼既漂亮又温馨012---Listen. As beautiful and moving as this ceremony is,
这是不合法的012---this is not legal.
他们没有结婚证书012---Okay. They don't have a marriage license
也没有证婚人012---and they don't have any witnesses,
而且新郎只穿了一只鞋012---and the groom only has one shoe.
对  他把另一只鞋脱了  用来打我012---Yeah, he took the other one off and hit me with it.
我该怎么办012---What am I supposed to do?
你应该了解他们是成年人012---You're supposed to realize they are adults
可以自己做决定012---and that can make their own decisions.
不  他们不能  他们笨到让自己怀孕012---No, they can't. They were stupid enough to get knocked up!
预防措施不一定有效对吧012---Contraceptives are not always effective. Right?
对  我们没有做预防措施012---Yeah. We kind of didn't use any.
孩子们  别帮倒忙了012---Come on, kids, a little help here!
这个地方真的很棒012---Wow! This place is incredible!
史汀的笔...012---Sting's pen...
他送给了菲比012---...that he gave to Phoebe.
来吧  秘密通道012---Come on, secret passageway.
我是楚蒂  你一定是本的妈妈012---I'm Trudie. You must be Ben's mum.
不然我为什么要到这里来呢012---Why else would I be here?
请坐012---Why don't you sit down.
我知道杰克跟本最近处得不太好012---I gather Jack and Ben haven't been getting along lately.
我相信这个故事一定有两面说法012---I'm sure there are two sides to this story.
但我听到的是本是个"大笨蛋"012---But all I've heard is that Ben's a bit of a "poopoohead."
抱歉  杰克的爸爸不会来吗012---I'm sorry, won't Jack's father be joining us?
对不起  杰克的爸爸没空012---Well, I'm sorry. Jack's father's not available.
好吧  我们可以改约到周五晚上012---Okay. Well, then, could we reschedule for Friday night,
八点见行吗012---perhaps at 8:00?
不  那样行不通012---No, I know that wouldn't work.
我丈夫要办演唱会012---My husband's in concert.
演唱会012---Concert. Yeah.
这让问题变得有点棘手012---That does put us in quite a pickle.
演唱会前后我都有事012---Because you see I'm busy before and after the concert,
演唱会的时间他又很忙012---and he's obviously busy during.
我想你跟我现在该来谈谈杰克跟本的事012---So I guess you and I should talk about Jack and Ben right now.
除非...012---Unless... Unless...
我愿意到演唱会上...012---Okay, I would be willing to go to the concert...
想一想孩子们的事012---...all the while thinking about the children, of course.
你是来要票的吗012---Are you here for tickets?
谢谢  四张就够了012---Thank you. Four would be great.
我不会把演唱会门票012---I'm not giving concert tickets
送给这样利用自己孩子的人012---to someone who'd use their son like this.
那正好  本不是我的儿子012---Then you're in luck. Ben's not my son.
听着  我已经按下了静声警铃012---Look, I've just pressed a button triggering a silent alarm.
警察随时会到012---Any minute now, the police will be here.
"警察乐队"要来？012---The Police? Here?
他们要复合了012---A reunion?
好吧  已经走了十条街  只剩五条012---Okay, 10 blocks down. Five to go.
等一下  停012---Oh, wait! Stop, stop!
抱歉  你需要休息吗012---Oh, I'm sorry. Do you need a break?
是棕黄色的同款靴子012---My boots in tan!
你能靠近一点  让我看看价钱吗012---Can you get a little closer so I see the price?
我在这里就看到了 它会害你丢掉一个老公012---I can see it from right here. It'll cost you one husband.
抱歉  我可以自己走了012---I'm sorry. I can walk the rest of the way now.
把我的靴子还给我012---Just give me my boots.
我没有拿你的靴子012---I don't have your boots.
我也没拿  那在哪里012---I don't have them either. Where are they?
你为什么不去看看鞍囊里有没有012---Why don't you check in one of my saddlebags
我先去吃点草012---while I chew on a bale of hay?
好吧  天啊  我们得回去找靴子012---Okay. My God, we gotta go back and get them!
亲爱的  你还会再穿那双靴子吗012---Hoeny, are you ever gonna wear the boots again?
好吧  我再也不会穿了012---Okay, I'll never wear them again.
我只是还没机会说再见012---I just didn't get a chance to say goodbye.
你可以跟棕黄色的靴子说再见012---You know what? You can say goodbye to the tan ones.
好吧  好吧012--- Okay. All right.  Okay.
再见  靴子  等一下  打五折012---Bye, boots. Wait! Half off!
乔伊  他们不打算结婚012---Joey, just because they're not getting married
不代表这就是件坏事012---doesn't mean this is gonna be a disaster.
或许他们有计划012---Maybe they have a plan.
好吧  我们听听他们的计划012---Oh, okay, let's hear their plan.
蒂娜跟巴比会有什么样的未来012---Now, what's the future look like for Dina and Bobby?
这个嘛...012---Well...
我对我的乐队期望很高012---...I really have high hopes for my band.
你说得对  他是很好笑  等一下012--- You were right. He is funny.  Now, wait a minute.
我敢说你一开始告诉大家012---I bet when you told people
你要当演员  大家都笑你012---you wanted to be an actor, they laughed at you.
来吧  巴比  跟我们谈谈你的乐队012---Come on, Bobby, tell us a little bit about your band.
团员只有我跟我朋友鲁斯特012---Well, it's just me and my pal Rooster.
乐队名字叫做"呆瓜"012---The band's name is Numbnuts.
真的吗012---Really?
蒂娜  如果你要生孩子  你应该结婚012---Dina, if you're having a baby, you should be married.
即使是嫁给巴比  我不是在夸奖你012---Even if it is to Bobby. Dude, that's not a compliment.
乔伊  我就知道你不会支持我012---Joey, I knew you wouldn't be supportive.
你打算怎么办012---So, what are you gonna do?
你要生下孩子  自己带大吗012---You're gonna have the baby and raise it by yourself?
没有丈夫帮你012---Without a husband?
你没办法当单亲妈妈012---You can't be a single mother alone!
你会毁了自己的一生012---You're gonna ruin your life!
对不起  我在自毁人生吗012---Excuse me. Am I ruining my life?
不  你不一样012---No, it's different for you.
你很坚强独立012---You're so strong and together.
你不是不知道自己在做什么的笨小孩012---You're not some dumb kid who doesn't know what she's doing.
你说什么012---Excuse me?
我一次只能跟一个孕妇说话012---One pregnant woman at a time, please!
我只是希望你过得好012---I just want you to be okay.
逼她嫁给巴比  她就会过得好吗012---So forcing her to marry Bobby is gonna make that happen?
或许吧012---Maybe.
对  "呆瓜"主要做什么类型的音乐012---Yeah. So, what kind of music does Numbnuts...?
算了  我办不到012---Oh, forget it! I can't!
乔伊  这件事真的让我很害怕012---Joey, I am scared to death about this.
但我想我办得到  我只是需要帮助012---But I really think I can do it. I'm just gonna need some help.
巴比会一直陪着我  没错012--- Bobby's gonna be here the whole time.  You bet I am.
至于你刚刚问的那个问题012---And to answer your earlier question,
我们唱纯粹的匪帮说唱012---we're straightup gangster rap.
瑞秋告诉我你一直都很支持她012---Look, Rachel's told me how much easier you've made all this on her.
你为什么不能支持我012---Why can't you do that for me?
因为你是我的妹妹012---Because you're my baby sister!
你是我哥哥012---And you're my big brother.
你是我全世界最喜欢的人012---I mean, you're my favorite guy in the whole world.
我甚至不怕告诉妈妈跟爸爸012---I'm not even scared to tell Mom and Dad.
我害怕告诉你012---I was scared of telling you.
我也会怕他们  但好吧012---I'd be scared of them, but all right.
想到你会因为我怀孕而生我的气012---Joey, I can't stand the thought of having this baby
我就受不了012---with you mad at me.
我要他有舅舅012---I want him to have his uncle.
我的宝宝会有乔伊舅舅吗012---Is my baby gonna have his Uncle Joey?
他当然会有乔伊舅舅012---Of course he's gonna have his Uncle Joey.
我们会没事的012---We'll be all right.
即使我们没结婚  宝宝还是会得到宠爱012---I mean, even if we're not married, this baby is gonna be so loved.
不只是我们会爱他  没错012--- And not just by us.  That's right.
他的舅舅也会爱他012---By his uncle too.
还有你012---And by you.
巴比  我们还是过来012---Okay, Bobby, why don't we come over here
让他们独处一下吧012---and let them have a little moment, okay?
过来012---Come here.
不  说真的  你到底有什么问题012---No, seriously, what's wrong with you?
你一定爱死我了012---You're gonna love me so much.
我弄到史汀的门票了012---I got Sting tickets!
天啊  我真的爱你  你怎么办到的012---Oh, my God, I do love you! How did you do it?
就说012---Well, let's just say:
罗斯真厉害012---Rose can!
座位是哪一区  在中间包厢012--- Where are the seats?  Middle balcony.
我们的位置离史汀  他太太012---Okay. Would you say that's more than 50 yards away
还有他的家人超过50码吗012---from Sting, his wife or a member of his family?
对  那样就不犯法  我可以去012--- Yeah.  Then that's not breaking the law. I'm there!
菲比  快看窗边那个男的012---Phoebe. Will you check out that guy by the window.
他矮得出奇012---He's awfully short.
而且我觉得他在自言自语012---And I think he's talking to himself.
老实说  他的床上功夫不怎么样012---And to be completely honest, he's not that good in bed.
我最近是怎么了012---What is wrong with me lately?
我对看到的每个男人都心动012---It's like, every guy I see.
譬如说那个男的012---I mean, look at that guy, for example.
他不是我喜欢的那一型012---That's not someone I would be attracted to.
但凭我现在的感觉012---But right now, with the way I'm feeling,
我一心想撕开他的运动裤跟腰包012---all I want to do is rip off his sweatpants and fanny pack.
等一下012---Wait a second!
你怀孕大概四个月了吧012---This is about the fourth month of your pregnancy, right?
对  这再正常不过了012--- Yeah.  This is completely normal.
怀孕四个月时  你的荷尔蒙分泌会失控012---Around the fourth month, your hormones start going crazy.
真的吗  你当时也是这样吗  没错012--- Really? So this has happened to you?  Absolutely! Yeah.
别忘了我怀的是三胞胎012---And keep in mind now, I was carrying triplets.
从医学上来说  我的欲望要比你强三倍012---So in medical terms, I was thrice as randy.
原来是这么一回事012---Wow, this explains so much!
上周末我走遍每一家商店012---Last weekend, I went from store to store,
坐在圣诞老人的大腿上012---sitting on Santas' laps.
对  我记得我当时想要从健身房012---Yeah, I remember trying to steal a cardboard cutout...
偷走艾凡德·霍利菲尔德的人形立牌012---...of Evander Holyfield from a Foot Locker.
明天我得去看医生  我到时问问她012---Well, I go see my doctor tomorrow. I'll ask her about this.
或许她可以开个药给我吃012---Maybe she can give me a pill or something.
对  你正是需要吃药  对症"下药"012---Yeah, that's what you need. A good pill.
《老友记》  第八季  第11集  罗斯向前跨了一大步012---Friends S08E11 The One With Ross'Big Step Forward
我把我们到洛克菲勒中心的照片洗出来了012---I got our pictures developed from Rockefeller Center.
太棒了  乔伊  你想看我跟蒙娜012---Great. Hey, Joey, want to check out pictures
去溜冰的照片吗012---of me and Mona iceskating?
换做平常我会想看012---Ordinarily, I would love to,
但现在我真的好忙012---but I am just swamped right now.
那个怪怪的咸酥饼小贩012---Where are the pictures that
帮我们合拍的照片在哪里012---that creepy pretzel vendor took of us together?
对  或许在最后面012---Oh, yeah. Probably at the end.
天啊  他只拍了我的胸部012---Oh, my God! All he took were pictures of my breasts.
我也想看照片012---I'm missing picture time!
她长得也不错耶  罗斯012---You know, she has a face, Ross.
我们这张合照很不错012--- Okay, here's a good one of us.
这张真的很棒  看起来很像节日贺卡012---Wow, that is a good one! It looks like a holiday card.
中间有树  还有溜冰客和雪012---With the tree in the middle and the skaters and the snow.
每年我都说要寄节日贺卡012---Every year, I say I'm gonna send out
但从来都没着手去做012---holiday cards and I never do it.
你要跟我一起寄这张卡片吗012---Do you want to send this one out together?
一起寄我们的合照给大家012---Together? Like, to people?
对  "佳节愉快  蒙娜跟罗斯上"012---Yeah. "Happy holidays, from Mona and Ross."
一定会很棒  对吧012---It'll be cute, okay?
好吧012---Okay.
我得去上班了012---I gotta get to work.
待会打电话给我  没问题012--- Call me later?  Sure, sure.
大家再见  再见012--- Bye, guys.  Bye.
恭喜  你刚刚结婚了012---Congratulations! You just got married!
我知道  你敢相信吗012---I know. Can you believe that?
抱歉  一张贺卡有什么大不了的012---I'm sorry. What's the big deal about a holiday card?
已婚夫妻跟家人才会一起寄照片012---Married couples send out cards. Families send out cards.
约会了几个月的情侣012---People who have been dating for a couple of months
不会一起寄卡片012---don't send out cards.
她疯了吗012---What is she, crazy?
你说的人可是你老婆012---That's your wife you're talking about!
宾  还有宾太太012---Bing! And the Bingette!
老婆  你记得我老板道格吧  记得012--- Oh, honey, you remember my boss, Doug.  Yes. Hi.
好消息  我已经离婚了012---Hi. So, good news! The divorce is final.
我今天早上签了文件012---I signed the papers this a.m.
我不知道你跟卡拉离婚了  我很遗憾012---I didn't know you and Kara divorced. I'm sorry.
遗憾  我终于可以脱离苦海了012---Sorry? I finally chewed my leg out of that bear trap.
不过还是恭喜你们012---Congratulations to you guys, though.
我们感情好着呢012---No legchewing for us, sir.
等着瞧吧012---Well, give it time.
你们刚结婚  我刚离婚  该好好庆祝一番012---So the divorce, the marriage, we got a lot to celebrate.
我们何不明晚一起吃晚餐012---How about we all go out to dinner tomorrow night.
我想不出来我们明晚要做什么事012---I can't think of anything we're doing.
为什么我想不出来我们明晚要做什么事012---Why can't I think of anything we're doing?
那就定在明晚  我六点应该能离开法庭012---Tomorrow night it is. I should be out of court by 6.
他们一直拿性骚扰案扔给我012---They keep throwing sexual harassment cases at me...
我总能把他们打得毫无退路012---...and I keep knocking them out of the park!
好吧  明天见012---Okay, see you tomorrow.
你要知道  我们明天不能跟他见面012---Just so you know, we're not seeing him tomorrow.
我没办法再跟他共度一个夜晚012---I can't spend another evening with that man.
你记得他在我们的婚礼上做了什么吗012---Do you remember how he behaved at our wedding?
不记得  那是因为我们没有邀请他012--- No.  That's because he wasn't invited.
因为他在我们的订婚派对上为非作歹012---Because of the way he behaved at our engagement party.
对  小便直接喷中了冰雕  对吧012---Oh, yeah! Urine cuts right through an ice sculpture, doesn't it?
我去过照相馆了  你看012---Hi! I went by the photo shop. Take a look.
这是卡片的初稿  你觉得怎样012---Here is a mockup of our card. What do you think?
真的很棒012---Wow, that's great.
你觉得我们该写上"爱你们的罗斯跟蒙娜"吗012---Do you think it should say, "Love, Ross and Mona"?
我们还没有对彼此说过"爱"012---Well, we haven't said that to each other yet...
但我猜跟其他人说说应该没关系012---...but I guess it's okay to say it to other people.
你要多少张012---How many did you want?
我要100张  100张012--- I'll get 100. A hundred?
那我就要...012---Well, I guess I'll take...
蒙娜012---Mona?
我不确定印卡片这件事妥不妥012---I'm not sure about the whole card thing.
真的吗  为什么012---Really? Why not?
我们一起寄节日贺卡012---Sending out a holiday card together?
我不知道我们之间是不是到那个地步了012---I just don't know if we're really quite there yet.
我没想到那一点  你说得对012---I didn't think of it that way. You're right. You're right.
我能问你一个问题吗  好啊012--- So can I ask you a question?  Yeah.
我们到哪个地步了012---Where are we?
我们到哪个地步了012---You know, like where are we?
我们会有什么结局012---Where is this relationship going?
我喜欢跟你待在一起012---I mean, I love spending time with you.
我只是希望我们在往前走012---I just hope we're moving forward.
我们该谈一谈  你不觉得吗012---We should talk about that, don't you think?
我们一起印卡片吧012---Let's do the card!
什么  卡片  我想我们到这个地步了012--- What?  The card! I think we're there!
好吧  但我还是觉得我们应该谈一谈012---Okay. But I still think we should have this conversation.
真的吗012---Really? I mean...
印了卡片还是要谈吗012---Even with the card?
朗医生今天没办法过来012---Just so you know, Dr. Long can't be here today,
她有事去医院了  辛夫医生会帮你检查012---she was called to the hospital, so Dr. Schiff will be seeing you.
好吧  我能问你一个问题吗012---Oh, okay. Can I ask you a question?
是我的问题  还是帮我抽血的那个家伙012---Was it me, or was the guy who took my blood sample
真的很帅012---really cute?
你知道我在说谁吗012---You know who I'm talking about?
锅盖头  手指满是毛的家伙012---Bowl haircut, hairy fingers?
瑞秋吗  我是辛夫医生  是啊012--- Hi, Rachel? I'm Dr. Schiff.  Yes, you are.
情况如何012---So, how's it going?
真的很不错  但别谈我了012---It's going really good. But enough about me! Come on.
你是哪里人  你是做哪一行的012---Where are you from? What do you do?
我是医生  对  我是指...012--- I'm a doctor.  Right. I meant...
你有空的时候  你会煮饭或滑雪吗012---...in your spare time. Do you cook? So you ski?
还是会跟太太或女朋友一起出去玩012---Or just hang out with your wife, or girlfriend?
我没有太太或女朋友  但我很喜欢滑雪012---I don't have a wife or a girlfriend, but I do like to ski.
我也喜欢滑雪  我们简直太有缘了012---I love to ski! How amazing is this?
你最近有任何不适症状吗012---Are you experiencing any discomfort?
不  我非常舒服012---No, I'm very comfortable.
放屁会不舒服吗  不会012--- Any painful gas?  No!
辛夫医生  那是哪门子的问题012---No! Shoot, Dr. Schiff! What kind of question is that?
好吧  能麻烦你躺下来吗012---Okay, then. Would you like to lie down on the table?
你想让我躺下来吗012---Would you like me to lie down on the table?
抱歉  我们之间是不是有什么情况012---I'm sorry. Is there something going on here?
你也感觉到了吗012---Do you feel it too?
门诊看得如何012---So, how did your doctor's appointment go?
让我想一想012---Well, let's see,
今天他们派了一个"帅哥"医生给我012---they gave me "cute boy" doctor today.
检查到一半  我把小指放到他的下巴酒窝里了012---In the middle of the exam, I put my pinkie in his chin dimple.
天啊  你为什么要那么做012--- Oh, my God!  Why did you do that?
还记得我怀孕四个月时012---Remember that little problem
遇到的那个小问题吗012---I was having during my fourth month of pregnancy?
对  艾凡德·霍利菲尔德的人形立牌012---Oh, yeah! The Evander Holyfield phase.
天啊  你当时病急乱投医  甚至朝我扑过来012---Oh, man! You were so hard up, you practically came on to me.
少做梦了012---You wish.
如果我真的想要你  完全可以钓到你012---Hey, I could have had you if I wanted you.
是吗  来试试看吧012---Oh, yeah? Come and get it.
好了  连这段对话都能挑起我的欲望012---Okay, even this is turning me on...
罗斯012---Hey, Ross!
你跟蒙娜还好吧012---How's it going with you and Mona?
你们还在一起吗012---Are you guys still together?
对  我们有所进展  你们会收到我们的卡片012---Yeah, we're moving forward. You'll be getting our card.
你们要一起寄节日贺卡吗012---You're doing a holiday card together?
我们不只要寄节日贺卡012---We're not just doing a card.
她还要谈一谈012---She also wants to have the conversation...
我们会有什么结局012---...about where the relationship is going.
女人啊012---Women!
就是嘛  为什么你们想要谈这种问题012---I know! Why do you guys need to have this conversation?
懂得自我尊重的男人不会问女人012---No selfrespecting man would ask a woman,
"我们会有什么结局"012---"So where is this going?"
罗斯  你问过我012---Ross, you asked me that.
你像是本合上的书  好吗012---You were a closed book, okay?
我又不会读心术012---I'm not a mind reader!
而且我讨厌谈那种话题012---Besides, I hate those conversations.
我真的不大会应付那种对话012---I'm horrible at them. Really.
或许我需要暗示她012---Maybe I need some kind of a gesture...
我们的确有进展012---...something that says we're moving forward
而不必去谈这件事012---without having to talk about it.
像是请她搬去跟你一起住012---Like asking her to move in with you?
这有点过了012---Smaller than that.
帮她录集锦录音带  又欠点火候012--- Making her a mix tape?  Bigger than that.
给她你家的钥匙012---Give her a key to your apartment.
我们的感情还是更接近送录音带的程度012---Hello. We were closer with the mix tape.
你说过"我爱你"吗  你可以说"我爱你"012---Have you said, "I love you"? You could say, "I love you."
我觉得我还没有到那个地步012---I don't think I'm quite there yet.
但我可以说"我喜欢跟你在一起"012---But I could say, "I love spending time with you."
我们讨厌那句话012---We hate that.
简直就像是被人闪了一巴掌012---That is a slap in the face.
算了  我还是去跟她谈吧012---Forget it. You know what? I'll just have the conversation.
我会说我喜欢我们现在的样子012---I'll just say I like things the way they are,
并怀着最好的期待012---and hope for the best.
你觉得呢  瑞秋012---What do you think, Rach?
我想如果这里再冷一点012---I think if it was a little colder in here...
我可以看到你乳头凸显012---...I could see your nipples through that sweater.
宾  我们今晚八点出发012---Bing? We're all set for tonight, 8:00.
我们去不成了  莫妮卡得上班012---As it turns out, we can't do it. Monica has to work.
我前妻不上班012---My exwife didn't work.
除非你说回娘家是"上班"012---Unless you call turning into her mother "work."
好吧  那就明天晚上吧012---Fine. Tomorrow night then.
她明晚也不能来  为什么012--- Tomorrow's no good for her, either.  Why not?
草地保龄球巡回赛012---It's the semifinals...
要打半决赛012---...of her bocce ball tournament.
发生了什么事  宾012---What's going on, Bing?
你老婆不喜欢我吗012---Does your wife have a problem with me or something?
你这话说得太离谱了012---Well, now you're just talking crazy.
那我们三个为什么不能一起出去玩012---Then why can't the three of us go out together?
因为我们分居了012---Because we split up.
莫妮卡跟我分居了012---Monica and I split up.
抱着我012---Hold me.
天啊  宾  我倒也不觉得诧异012---Good God, Bing. Well, I can't say I'm altogether surprised.
我看到她看你的眼神  就知道她不爱你012---I saw the way she looked at you, and there was no love there.
而她看着我时却充满了爱欲012---And the way she looked at me, pure lust.
在这种时候  只有掐人脖子012---What would really help me through this tough time
才能让我泄愤  我能掐你吗012---is choking someone. Can I choke you?
宾  孩子  我得让你放下这件事012---Bing, my boy, we're gonna get you over this.
我有个计划012---Here's the plan:
拿着你的外套  我们去脱衣舞俱乐部012---Grab your coat, we're going to a strip club!
不  莫妮卡会生气的012---Oh, no! Monica would freak.
但谁管那个臭女人呢012---But to hell with that bitch!
咖啡来了012---Here we go.
蒙娜  我们该谈谈012---Mona, it's time we had a conversation
我们之间的关系了012---about where things are with us.
是啊  那还是我先提出来的012---Yeah, I think I suggested that.
我们简直...012---We are so...
我真的很喜欢你012---Well, I really like you.
我喜欢跟你在一起012---And I love hanging out with you.
和你相处  我非常开心012---And I'm having a lot of fun.
好吧012---Okay.
如果只是为了好玩  我们就不必交往了012---There's no point in spending time with someone if it's just fun.
我们得有结果  对吧012---It's gotta be going somewhere, right?
我们会有什么结果012---So where is it going?
这才是实质性的问题012---That's the real question.
答案是...012---And the answer is...
我们会相处得...012---...it's going somewhere...
很开心012---...fun.
我知道你在想什么012---I know what you're thinking.
如果是十年前  还可以找找乐子012---Fun was fine for you 10 years ago.
但现在你也不年轻了012---But you're not getting any younger.
我不是说你  不是你012---No! I mean, not you. Not you.
你越来越年轻了012---You are getting younger!
你每一秒都在变年轻012---You're getting younger by the second.
你有什么秘诀012---What's your secret?
抱歉  我们发展到哪一步了012---I'm sorry, so where are we?
总而言之...012---Well, to sum up...
我们相处得很开心012---...we're having fun.
你看起来很年轻012---You look young.
好吧...  但这还远远不够012--- Okay...  But that's not enough.
所以...012---So...
这是我家的钥匙012---...here's a key to my apartment.
真的吗  真的012--- Really?  Really.
你不觉得发展得太快了吗012---You don't think this is too fast?
你给了她你家的钥匙012---You gave her a key to your apartment?
不仅是那样  我把唯一的钥匙给了她012---Not just a key. I gave her the only key!
我现在是个陷入认真感情  无家可归的家伙012---I am now a homeless person in a very serious relationship!
罗斯  你们谈得如何012---Ross, how did the conversation go?
很棒  我现在流落街头了012---Great. I live on the street.
哪里012---Where?
好吧  莫妮卡  瑞秋...012---Okay, Monica, Rachel...
他是我朋友罗杰  嗨  罗杰012---...this is my friend Roger.  Hi, Roger.
罗杰012---Hi, Roger.
我去拿饮料  你能过来帮我吗012---I'll get us some drinks. Could you help me out?
好吧012---Yeah, okay.
他是来跟你做爱的012---He's here to have sex with you.
什么  别客气012--- What?  You're welcome.
菲比  不  没关系  他是个处男012--- Phoebe, no!  It's okay. He's a virgin.
瑞秋  我跟这个家伙聊天012---Rachel, I was talking to this guy.
我觉得他要跟你做爱012---I think he'll have sex with you.
让他们两个独处一下吧012---Let's leave these two alone.
不要  不管我的荷尔蒙怎么作祟012---No! I don't care what my hormones are doing!
我不会随便跟男人上床012---I won't do it with some random guy!
好吧  那么你去告诉罗杰012---Fine! Then you tell Roger,
因为他真的很期待这场艳遇012---because he was really looking forward to this!
宾  快看那对双胞胎姐妹一起跳舞012---Bing! Look at those twin sisters dancing together.
我出钱请她们在你大腿上跳艳舞吧012---Let me buy you a lap dance with those girls.
不用了  而且只有一个女孩在跳舞012---That's all right, sir. And that's just one girl.
宾  这是什么  那是我的手012--- Bing, what's this?  It's a hand.
用来帮你端酒的工具012---It's a thing you use as a Jack and Coke holder.
不  是婚戒  你得把它丢掉012---No. It's a wedding ring. You gotta get rid of it.
我们现在就到东河把它扔下去012---We're gonna go to the East River right now and throw it in there!
不要  要012--- No!  Yes!
我就那么做了  感觉好很多012---I did it, and I felt a lot better!
如果你仍得有准头  甚至可能会打中海鸥012---And if you whip it just right you might hit a seagull in the head.
好吧  我需要一堆备用钥匙012---Okay. I'm gonna need a bunch of extra keys.
很明显  我会毫无理由地把钥匙送人012---Apparently, I give them away for no reason at all.
罗斯  发生了什么事  你在换锁012---Ross, what's going on? You're changing the lock?
不是012---No.
是那个家伙在换锁012---That guy is.
我这就不懂了  你刚把你家的钥匙给我012---I don't understand. You give me a key to your apartment,
然后你就把锁换了012---and then you change the lock?
祝你好运  哥们012---Good luck, buddy.
我以为我们往前迈进了一步012---I thought we were moving forward.
而现在你却向我发送各种混乱讯息012---Now you're sending me all these mixed signals.
你到底想告诉我什么012---What are you trying to tell me?
我想告诉你...012---I'm trying to tell you...
我帮你录了一卷集锦录音带012---...I made you a mix tape.
什么  我爱你012--- What?  I love you.
我喜欢跟你在一起012---And I love spending time with you.
老婆  我回来了012---Hi, honey, I'm home.
从龙舌兰酒工厂回来的012---From the tequila factory?
感觉糟透了012---It was awful.
为了逃避跟道格的晚餐约会012---To get out of going to dinner with Doug,
我告诉他你跟我分居了012---I told him you and I split up.
他拖我去脱衣舞俱乐部  还有色情酒吧012---So then he took me to these strip clubs and sleazy bars.
我不肯把婚戒交给他012---When I wouldn't give him my wedding ring,
他就用汽水罐打小鸟012---he threw a soda can at a bird.
过来  我可以用嘴巴呼吸012---Come here. I can breathe through my mouth.
亲爱的  你知道最糟糕的是什么吗012--- Oh, sweetie. You know what the worst part was?
我预见到了没有你的生活是什么样子012---I got to see what my life would be like without you.
就像是《生活多美好》配上艳舞012---It was like It's a Wonderful Life with lap dances.
请答应我  你永远不会离开我012---Please promise me that you'll never leave me...
我们会一起变老012---...that we'll grow old together,
相伴一生012---and be with each other for the rest of our lives.
我答应你012---I promise.
说到相伴一生012---Speaking of together,
我们今年一起寄节日贺卡吧012---how about we send out a holiday card this year?
我不知道我们是不是到那个地步了012---I don't know if we're there yet.
我想订披萨  我能问你一个问题吗012---I'd like to order a pizza. Can I ask you a question?
今晚是那个金发帅哥外送吗012---Is the cute blond guy delivering tonight?
长得又酷又时髦的那个012---Very "Abercrombie & Fitch."
我再打给你  你在跟谁打电话012--- I'll call you back.  Who was that?
我在订披萨012---It's just the pizza place.
你竟然挂掉了订披萨的电话012---You hung up on the pizza place?
我可不会挂掉你朋友的电话012---I don't hang up on your friends.
抱歉  今天我过得不顺心012---Sorry, honey, I'm just having a rough day.
怎么了012---What's wrong?
你不会想听的012---You don't want to hear about it.
不然我为什么要问012---Then why did I ask?
这真的很丢脸012---Okay, this is really embarrassing,
但最近自从我怀孕后012---but lately, with this whole pregnancy thing...
我发现自己...012---...I'm just finding myself...
我该怎么说呢012---How do I put this?
春情大发012---Erotically charged.
那是"性饥渴"的学名吗012---Is that college talk for "horny"?
对  我心中充满了欲望012---Yeah. I have all of these feelings,
但却不知道该怎么处理012---and I don't know what to do about them.
我没办法像正常人去约会012---I can't date like a normal person,
这没关系  因为我不需要男朋友012---which is fine because I don't need a relationship.
我只想要一夜情  只有性爱就好012---All I really want is one great night! Just sex.
没有牵绊  不谈恋爱012---No strings attached. No relationship.
就跟我喜欢的人在一起012---With someone I feel comfortable with,
他懂得掌握分寸012---and who knows what he's doing.
只要共度一夜春宵012---For just one great night.
真的就那么难...012---I mean, is that really so hard...
找到吗012---...to find?
你今天过得如何012---So how was your day?
很好  我看见一只超大的鸽子012---Good. I saw a pretty big pigeon.
我还得早起  都快七点了012---Well, I gotta get up early, and it's almost 7:00.
我得回房了  晚安012--- I gotta go to my room.  Good night!
晚安012---Good night!
我不能那么做  我没有要你那么做012--- I can't do it!  I didn't ask you to do it!
你是瑞秋  你是乔伊012--- You're Rachel!  You're Joey!
你是我的朋友  你也是我的朋友012--- You're my friend!  Right back at you.
对  而且那样是不对的  怪异又恶劣012---Yeah. Plus, it would be wrong, and weird and bad!
太恶劣了  但我不知道你在说什么012---So bad! But I don't know what you're talking about.
因为我没要求你做什么事  我知道012--- Because I didn't ask you to do anything!  I know!
你想做吗  不想012--- You wanna do it?  No!
我也不想  我只是在考验你012---Me neither. I'm just testing you!
那这件事就到此为止了012---Well, that's the end of this conversation!
就当什么都没发生过  没错012--- This conversation never happened!  Never happened!
晚安  晚安012--- Good night!  Good night!
快回你房里012---Get back in there!
听着  关于罗杰的事  我很抱歉012---Listen, I'm sorry about that whole thing with Roger.
那么做很不合适  我想弥补你012---It really wasn't right. And I want to make it up to you.
我带了一样我觉得你会喜欢的东西来012---So I brought you something I think you'll really enjoy.
我只是借给你用  好吗012---Now this is just a loan, okay?
我还会把它拿回去012---I'm gonna want him back.
我得走了012---I'm gonna go now.
抱歉  我以为我办得到  但却不行012---I'm sorry. I thought I could do it, and I can't.
我帮你们准备了一份礼物012---Hey, I got you a present!
天啊  你之前把它藏在哪里了012---Oh, my goodness, where did you hide it?
我几周前订了当做你们结婚的礼物012---I got it for your wedding and I ordered it weeks ago,
现在终于送来了012---and it finally got here!
菲比  你不必送我们结婚礼物012---Pheebs, you didn't have to get us anything
你已经唱过...012---for our wedding you already sang...
我喜欢  好大啊  快打开吧012---I love it! It's huge! Let's open it! Let's open it!
是"吃豆小姐"的游戏机  我的天啊012--- It's a Ms. PacMan machine!  Oh, my God!
我不知道该放到哪里  就暂时放在客厅了012---I didn't know where to put it, so I just left it here for now.
我们可以把它放在客房  好吧012--- We can put it in the guest bedroom.  Yeah, okay.
我觉得放在这里挺好012---I kind of like it here.
你真的喜欢吗012---Do you really like it?
开什么玩笑  我小时候整天待在游乐场里012---Are you kidding?! I practically spent my entire childhood at the arcade.
这是我第二喜欢的游戏012---This is like...Oh my, this is like my second favorite game!
你最喜欢什么012---Really? What's your first?
我记不得名字了012---I don't remember the name of it.
内容是什么012---Well, what did it do?
把铜板放进去  拉把手012---You'd put a quarter in, pull some handles
就能拿到糖果012---and win a candy bar or something.
自动贩卖机012---A vending machine?
别可怜我  每次我都会赢012---Don't feel bad for me. I won every time!

太棒了  谢谢012---Great, thanks.
然后带她到四季饭店喝东西012---Then afterward you can take her to the Four Seasons for drinks.
或是到城里听爵士乐012---Or go downtown and listen to some jazz.
或是跳舞  带她去跳舞吧012---Or dancing. Oh, take her dancing!
你真的很会拖延性爱的进度012---You sure are naming a lot of ways to postpone sex.
我怀念约会的感觉  可以盛装打扮012---I miss dating. Getting all dressed up
去高级餐厅吃饭012---and going to a fancy restaurant.
我很久都没法再出去约会了012---I won't be able to do that for so long.
那真的很有趣012---And it's so much fun.
其实坐在这里012---Not that sitting at home worrying about
担心生孩子的事也挺有意思012---giving birth to a sixteen pound baby is not fun.
这样吧  我带你出去约会012---Hey, you know what? Why don't I take you out.
什么  你可不想跟孕妇约会012---What? Joey, you don't want to date a pregnant lady.
我愿意  我们就出去好好享受一番012---Yes, I do. We're gonna go out, we're gonna have a good time.
我会让你忘了生孩子  剖腹产012---I'll take your mind off of childbirth, and Csections...
宝宝的头撑大...012---...and gaint baby heads stretching out...
好吧  我答应你  我跟你去012---Okay, I'll go with you. I'll go with you.
会很好玩的  好吧012--- It will be fun.  All right.

好吧  轮到我了012---Okay, I'm next.
别再开始新一盘了  轮到我了  菲比012---Don't start another game. I'm next! Phoebe?
抱歉  我赢得太开心  听不到你说话012---Sorry, I couldn't hear you over all the winning.
菲比在霸占游戏机012---Chandler, Phoebe's hogging the game.
至于吗  不过是个愚蠢的游戏012---Who cares? It's a stupid game.
你觉得它蠢是因为你玩得太逊012---You only think it's stupid because you suck at it.
我不逊  是游戏太逊012---I don't suck. It sucks.
你才逊012---You suck.
如果这个游戏012---Wait okay, if this game
会惹得你们俩闹别扭012---is gonna cause problems between the two of you,
那我还是自己留着玩吧012---then maybe I should just keep it.
不  我喜欢它  这个礼物棒极了012---No, I love it. It is a great present.
你为什么不回家等我给你寄感谢贺卡呢012---In fact, why don't you go home and wait for the thankyou card?
你为什么这么想玩这个游戏012---Why do you want to play this game so badly?
是啊  又不是每玩完一盘就往外吐糖果012---Yeah! It's not like it spits out a Clark bar after every game.
好吧  菲比  够了  快起来012---Okay. Phoebe, that's it. Come on, out of the chair.
快点  快点  起来012---Come on. Come on, out of the chair.
菲比012---Phoebe!
乔伊  麻烦你去开门012---Joey, could you get that?
乔伊012---Joey.
你怎么在这儿012---What are you doing here?
我以为你在房里012---I thought you were in your room.
我是来接你去约会的012---No, I'm picking you up for our date.
这是送你的012---These are for you.
百合花  这是我最喜欢的花  谢谢012---Lilies. They're my favorite. Thank you.
还有巧克力布朗尼012---And a brownie.
只剩一半了012---Well, half a brownie.
其实只剩袋子了012---Actually, it's just a bag.
从花店走回来真的很远012---It's a long walk from the flower shop
我饿得头晕  所以...012---and I felt faint, so...
这简直太棒了  我觉得好像真的在约会012---This is so great! I actually feel like I'm on a real date.
不过我有种要晨吐的感觉012---Although, I have a hint of morning sickness,

那是我室友的杂志012---That's my roommate's.
我想见见他  他似乎是个好男人012---I'd like to meet him. He sounds like a standup guy.
但他对我的保护欲很强  你最好小心一点012---But he's protective of me, so you'd better watch yourself.
你室友很帅吗012---So this roommate of yours, is he goodlooking?
你一定要很努力才能控制自己不爱上他012---Must be tough to keep your hands off him.
我很确定他是男同志012---I'm pretty sure he's gay.
他才不是呢  你为什么要破坏这个游戏012---No! No, he's not! Why are you trying to ruin the game?
别这样嘛012---Come on.
这就又回到了葛瑞利的骨牌理论012---Which brings us back, of course, to Greely's Theory of Dominance.
今天的课就到这里012---That's it for today.
有人知道费利曼楼在哪里吗012---Does anyone know where the Freeman Building is?

菲力牛排搭配什么012---Now the filet mignon, what comes with that?
配菜是蒸蔬菜012---There's a side of steamed vegetables.
除了蔬菜...012---Instead of the vegetables...
我可以用什么菜品搭配012---...is there any way that I could substitute the...
三磅龙虾行吗012---...threepound lobster?
帮她把两道菜都送上来012---You know what? Bring her both.
我跟她点一样的东西012---And I'll have the same.
感觉这次约会很成功012---Wow, this is shaping up to be a pretty good date.
我差点忘了  我没付你房租012---I almost forgot. I didn't pay you the rent check.
别当我们是室友  我们在约会012---No roommate stuff, okay? We're on a date.
我就要知道乔伊·崔比安尼是怎么跟人约会的了012---Okay. Wow, so I get to see what Joey Tribbiani is like on a date.
你有什么招数吗012---Do you have any moves?
不  我只会做我自己012---No, I'm just myself,
如果她们不喜欢我012---and if they don't like me for...
抱歉  这种话我实在说不下去012---I'm sorry, I couldn't even get through that.
我就知道  告诉我你有什么招数012---I knew it. I knew it. Come, tell me your moves.
好吧012---All right.
约会一开始  我会假装有影迷012---I usually start by having a bottle of wine
送红酒给我012---sent to my table from a fan.
天啊  这招管用吗012---Oh, my God. And that works?
你得加上一句"真是太不好意思了012---Well, it does when you combine it with, "This is so embarrassing,
我只想过正常人的生活"012---I just want to have a normal life!"
你们这些可怜的名人012---You poor little famous man.
好吧  听听这招012---Okay, how about this one?
我本来想等到送你回家再吻你...012---I was gonna wait until the end of the night to kiss you...
但你真的太美了  我实在难以自持012---...but you're just so beautiful, I don't think I can.
天啊012---Oh, my God!
这招太绝了  我差点就凑上去了  真的012---Wow, that was fantastic! I almost leaned in. I really almost did.
告诉我你用的是什么招数012---All right. So tell me one of your moves.
好吧012---All right.
你是在哪里长大的012---So where'd you grow up?
那就是你的招数012---That's your move?
瑞秋  还好你长得很美012---Boy, Rach, you're lucky you're hot.
快回答我的问题  皇后区012--- Come on, just answer the question.  Queens.
你跟父母亲近吗012---So were you close to your parents?
我跟妈妈亲  跟爸爸不太说话012---With my mom. Not so much my dad.
为什么012---Why not?
我不知道  感觉我们之间有种隔阂012---I don't know. I guess there's just always been this distance.
我们都假装没有  但事实上不然012---I mean we both try to pretend it's not there, but it is.
那一定很辛苦012---It's gotta be rough.
对  真的很辛苦  有时候我觉得...012---Yeah, it's really tough. Sometimes I think...
太帅了012---Nice move!
"你在哪里长大的 "  这招好简单啊012---"Where'd you grow up?" So simple.
谢谢012---Thank you.
对不起  我要去洗手间012---Now, excuse me. I'm gonna use the restroom.
你在注视我离开的背影012---Now you're watching me walk away.
没错  太简单了012---Yes, I am! Again, so simple!
你一定不相信今天我做了什么012---You are not gonna believe what I did today.
很明显  你没洗澡  也没刮胡子012---It clearly wasn't showering or shaving.
我玩了一整天这个游戏  现在我是第一名012---I got good. I played this game all day, and now I rule at it.
他们应该把它改名为"钱德勒小姐"012---They should change the name to "Ms. Chandler."
还是不要好了012---Although, I hope they don't.
你待在家里玩了一整天"吃豆小姐"012---Wait a minute. You stayed home and played Ms. PacMan
而我在外面像牛一样工作012---while I went to work like a chump?
我包办了前十名  把菲比挤下了排行榜012---I got all the top 10 scores. I erased Phoebe off the board.
击掌庆祝一下吧012---Highfive!
你的手是怎么了012---What is the matter with your hand?
我打了八小时的电动012---I've been playing it for like eight hours,
会放松下来的  看看我的比分记录012---It'll loosen up. Come on. Check out the scores.
再看看我编的名字  全是脏话012---Also, look at the initials. They're dirty words.
钱德勒  你为什么要那么做012---Chandler, why would you do that?
因为这样很帅气012---Because it's awesome.
你觉得那么做很聪明吗012---You think it's clever?
我只能写下三个字母012---They only give you three letters,
除了ASS（屁股）外  其它名字很难想012---so after ASS, it is a challenge.
这不是脏话012---This one's not dirty.
把它跟那个连在一起就是了012---It is when you put it together with that one.
如果你不办法把它清掉012---If you don't clear this off,
以后就别想从我这里尝到那种甜头012---you won't get one of those from me.
本明天会过来玩游戏  不能让他看到这个012---Ben's coming over tomorrow to play this game. This can't be there.
他都不知道这些词是什么意思012---Come on. He won't know what they mean.
钱德勒  他都七岁了  他又不笨012---Chandler, he's 7, he's not stupid.
最近你跟他谈过吗012---Have you talked to him lately?
我要把插头拔掉012---I'm gonna unplug it.
别啊  拔掉之后  我今天就等于一无所获012---Nonono, if you unplug it, I'll have nothing to show for my day!
那和上班又有什么区别012---It would be like I was at work.
不012---No!
你看  记录还在012---Hey, look! It's still there!
这玩意一定是用的原始记忆晶片012---This thing must have some kind of primitive ROM chip or something!
你得打败自己的成绩012---Honey, you gotta beat your scores.
我的手指都张不开了012---With the claw?
好吧  让我来  我得把这些词消掉012---Fine, I'll do it. I've just got to get this off the screen.
卡罗尔还在气你教他"拉我的手指"012---Carol's still upset that you taught him "Pull my finger." 
拉我的手指  我的手都毁了012---Pull my finger. My hand is messed up!
我不会回答那个问题012---I am not gonna answer that.
来吧  快挑一个012---Oh, come on. Just pick one.
在莫妮卡  菲比  钱德勒跟罗斯之间...012---Between Monica, Phoebe, Chandler and Ross...
如果你迫不得已012---...if you had to, if you had to,
你会打谁012---who would you punch?
我们是朋友  我不会打他们012---No one! We're friends. I wouldn't punch any of them.
钱德勒吗012---Chandler?
对  但我不知道为什么012---Yeah, but I don't know why.
我玩得很开心  我也是012--- I'm having such a wonderful time!  Me too!
这是我最棒的约会经验  我知道012--- Rach, can I just say this is the best date I ever had.  I know!
我笑得好厉害012---I've never laughed so hard.
你看到酒从我鼻子喷出来吗012---Did you see the wine come out of my nose?
乔伊  我想大家都看到了012---Joey, I think everybody saw the wine come out of your nose.
我从不知道自己会这么喜欢012---I gotta say, I never knew I could enjoy
没有性爱的约会012---the nonsex part of a date so much.
那是因为你没有跟我约会过012---That's because you have never been on a date with me before.
好吧  别瞧不起我012---All right. Now don't judge me.
通常我会等我的对象离开了再这么做012---I normally wait till my date leaves,
但你住在这里  我要吃带回来的剩饭了012---but but you live here. I'm ripping into this swan.
好吧  你也别瞧不起我012---Okay, then you don't judge me.
我要去舔之前那个蛋糕的包装纸012---I'm gonna suck on the cellophane from that brownie I had before.
对012---Oh, yeah.
告诉我012---So tell me,
乔伊·崔比安尼说晚安的招数是什么012---what are Joey Tribbiani's endofthenight moves?
如果我想让那个女孩吻我...012---Well, if I want the girl to kiss me...
首先我会让我的嘴巴看起来难以抵抗012---...first thing I do is make my lips look irresistible.
你都是怎么做的012---How do you do that?
你不能告诉任何人  但是012---Now you can't tell anyone, but...
我会涂上护唇膏012---...I put on shiny lip balm.
天啊  女人就跟飞蛾扑火一样012--- Oh, my God.  Like a moth to a flame, I'm telling you.
好吧  轮到你了012---Okay, all right, so, now you go.
不  我不想告诉你012---No, I don't want to tell you.
为什么  那太丢脸了012--- Why not?  Because it's embarrassing.
比涂黑莓口味的护唇膏还丢脸012---More embarrassing than shiny raspberry lip balm?
我刚刚没说黑莓口味吧012---I didn't say raspberry before, did I?
快告诉我  瑞秋012---Just tell me, Rach. Just tell me.
好吧012---Okay.
站起来012---All right, stand up.
我们走到门口时...012---Well, when we're at the door...
我会将我的嘴唇轻轻压在他的嘴唇上012---...I lightly press my lips against his.
将身体靠向他  停留一秒钟012---Then move into his body, just for a second.
然后我会发出这样的声音012---And then I make this sound:
听起来没什么  但很有效012---It doesn't sound like anything, but I swear it works.
对  的确有效012---Oh, yeah. That would work, yeah.
好吧  我得睡了 我今晚玩得很开心012---All right, I gotta go to bed. Honey. I had such a wonderful time.
我也是012---Me too.
你上课迟到了50分钟  你是用爬的吗012---You were 50 minutes late to the class, what did you crawl there?
不  我用跑的  真的很远012---No, I ran, okay? It's really far.
现在的人怎么都听不懂012---When did people stop understanding
"别挡我的路"呢012---the phrase "Get the hell out of my way"?
你为什么不搭计程车012---Why didn't you take a cab?
塞车太严重  还净是单行道012---Between the traffic that time of day and all the oneway streets
搭计程车得花两倍的时间012---it'd take me twice as long.
再说  我一星期有三堂课012---Besides, I teach the class three times a week.
你以为我是富家子弟吗012---Who am I, Rockefeller?
你不能再继续这样下去了012---You won't be able to keep doing this.

只是我不能害怕被车子撞到012---I just can't be afraid to get a little bit hit by cars.
还记得昨晚我们谈过《狂犬惊魂记》吗012---Remember last night when we talked about Cujo?
我不敢相信你没看过《狂犬惊魂记》012---Yeah, I still can't believe you haven't seen Cujo.
真搞不懂你012---What is wrong with you?
至于吗  那又不是《公民凯恩》012---Relax, it's not like it's Citizen Kane.
你看完了《公民凯恩》012---Have you ever sat through Citizen Kane?
是啊  真的很无聊  但那可是经典012---Yeah, it's really boring. But it's, like, a big deal.
总之  我想去租《狂犬惊魂记》012---Anyway, I was thinking about renting Cujo sometime.
我们今晚一起看吧012---Yeah, all right. Well, let's do it tonight.
你不是有约会吗  对012--- Don't you have that big date tonight?  Oh, right.
乔伊  我能问你一件事吗  问吧012--- Hey, Joey, can I ask you something?  Yeah.
昨晚约会后  你有没有觉得怪怪的012---After our date last night, did you feel a little weird?
天啊  你也是吗012---Oh, my God. You did too?
我吓坏了  那是怎么回事012---It totally freaked me out. What was that?
我不知道012---I don't know.
我觉得应该是龙虾的问题012---I'm kind of thinking it was the lobster.
对啊  龙虾012---Oh, yeah. Yeah, the lobster.
我吐了一整晚  我也是012--- I was up sick all night.  Me too. All night.
真的吗  那我怎么没看到你012---Really? How come we didn't cross paths?
对  那是因为012---Yeah, well, that's because...
我都待在房里012---...I stayed in my room.
我的洗衣篮惨不忍睹012---You don't want to look in my hamper.
好了  吃掉那个012---Okay, I got that.
躲过那里  然后再回来012---I'll escape there. I'll come back here.
好了  加油  吃豆小姐012---All right. Come on, Ms. PacMan.
你就是个小贱人  对吧012---Well, you're just a little bitch, aren't you?!
大家好012---Hey, you guys?
抱歉之前我霸占着电动玩具012---I'm sorry that I was hogging the game before.
天啊012---Oh, my God!
你朋友名字的缩写真难听012---Your friends have some unfortunate initials.
那都是钱德勒干的012---They're all Chandler.
钱德勒不可能有这么厉害012---Chandler sucks. He couldn't get this good.
我很厉害  但那是要付出代价的012---I did. But it came at a price.
本今晚要过来  不能让他看到这些012---Ben's coming over tonight, and he can't see this.
七岁的孩子应该连杂交都看过了吧012---Come on. By age 7, kids have already seen orgies.
还是只有我而己012---Was it just me?
我办到了  我及时赶到了012---Yes, I made it! I'm on time!
好了  请大家012---Okay, why don't we all...
翻到第23页...012---...open our books to page 23...
你们...012---...where...
你们将会看到...012---...where you will see...
很多红点012---...a bunch of red spots.
请大家先看一会书  我要...012---Okay, why don't you all start to read while I...
你没事吗  你似乎有点心不在焉012---Are you all right? You seem a little distracted.
不  我没事  我只是012---No, no, I'm fine. It's just...
我能问你一件事吗012---Hey, can I ask you something?
你有没有这样的经验  看着你熟悉的人...012---Have you ever looked at someone you know for a while
突然间有不一样的感觉012---and suddenly seen them in a different way?
你是说从背后看吗012---You mean like from behind?
没错  就是那样012---Yeah. That's exactly it.
有一次  我从背后看这个家伙012---You know what? One time I saw this guy from behind
觉得他真的很普通012---and he seemed like a totally normal guy
他一转身  才发现他是史蒂芬·鲍德温012---And then he turned around and it was Stephen Baldwin!
对012---Yeah.
你完全了解我的意思012---So you know exactly what I'm talking about.
没错012---Totally!
我要失陪一会  请便012--- Would you excuse me for a sec?  Yeah. Sure.
菲比  你真的很厉害  我知道012--- Oh, my god. Phoebe! You're on fire!  I know!
就差一分了  你能行的012---One more score to go. You can do it!
别碰我  别碰她012--- Don't touch me!  Don't touch her!
左边  左边  右边  右边012---Go left! Go left! Go right! Go right!
我做不到012---I can't! I can't!
不  你这个天杀的...012---No! You son of a...
菲比012---Phoebe?!
本  别看机器012---Oh, hi, Ben. No, don't look at the machine!
谢天谢地你回来了  我在看《狂犬惊魂记》012---Thank God you're home! I'm watching Cujo.
你一个人  对  这只狗是怎么了012--- Alone?  Yes! What is wrong with this dog?
你看到他们被困在车里012---Did you get to the part where they're trapped in the car
库裘自己去撞车的那一幕了吗012---and Cujo's throwing himself at the windshield?
没有  说真的  这只狗有什么毛病012---No, seriously, what's wrong with the dog?
等一下  你怎么这么早就回来了012---Wait a minute, what are you doing home so early?
你不是去约会了吗012---What happened to your date?
我们之间不来电012---Oh, it didn't work out.
你要跟我一起把电影看完吗012---Do you want to watch the rest of the movie with me?
好吧012---Oh, okay. Yeah.
我以前从未对一部电影有这种感觉012---You know, I never thought I'd say this about a movie,
但我真希望这只狗死掉012---...but I really hope this dog dies.
你坐在那里干嘛  坐在这里保护我012---What are you doing over there? Come sit here, you protect me.
没问题  有何不可呢012---Oh. Sure, yeah. Why not?
好吧012---Okay.
那就是他012---Okay. That's him, that's him!
那就是库裘  我知道012--- That's Cujo! That's Cujo!  I know.
没事的012---It's gonna be okay.
天啊  他现在又要干嘛  我不敢看012---Oh, my God. What's he gonna do now? I can't watch.
你怎么能看得下去  你不害怕吗012---Seriously, how can you watch this? aren't you scared?
我怕极了012---Terrified.
大家都到了吗012---So is everybody here?
今天我提早到了012---I got here a little early, myself.
开始上课吧012---Let us begin.
海德罗恐龙主要012---Now, the hadrosaurids have been unearthed
分布在两个地方012---in two main locations.
这里...012---Here...
跟...012---...and...
这里012---...here.
至于水龙...012---Now, as for the hydrosaurs...
好了  这是全新的一天012---All right, it's a new day.
关于瑞秋的那件事呢012---All that stuff about Rachel?
现在你没那种感觉了  那简直太疯狂了012---You don't feel that now. It was crazy.
你没事  你好的不得了012---You're fine. You're better than fine.
你就像朋友汤尼说的那样  "棒极了"012---You are, as your friend Tony would say, "Great!"
一切都很正常012---Everything's normal.
她只是你的朋友  瑞秋012---She's just your friend, Rachel.
你的朋友瑞秋012---Your friend, Rachel.
你的朋友瑞秋012---Your friend. Rachel.
嗨  亲爱的012---Hi, sweetie.
嗨  她是你女朋友瑞秋012---Hey, it's your girlfriend, Rachel!
《老友记》  第八季  第13集  钱德的泡泡浴012---Friends S08E13 The One Where Chandler Takes a Bath
你...你磕嗨了吗012---Are you...? Are you high?
我刚刚泡了一个超舒服的澡012---I just had the most amazing bath.
真的吗  我不喜欢泡澡012---Really? I don't like baths.
你喜欢跟我泡鸳鸯浴啊012---Wait. You like them with me.
亲爱的  我喜欢的不是泡澡012---Honey, it's not the bath I enjoy.
我是喜欢看全身湿答答的裸体女人012---It's the wet, naked lady.
泡澡能让你全身放松012---Baths are so relaxing.
真的吗  你在里面做什么012---Really? What do you do?
不过是坐在浴缸里  泡着自己洗过的脏水012---You just sit in there, stewing in your own filth.
你觉得我能有多脏呢012---How dirty do you think I am?
如果你点上蜡烛012---I'm telling you if you had some candles
配上泡泡跟音乐  你一定会爱上泡澡012---and some bubbles and some music, you would love it.
能帮你解除压力  一身轻松012---It would take all of your stress away.
现在是星期三下午两点  我正在看越野单车赛012---Honey, it's 2:00 on a Wednesday and I'm watching Road Rules.
你觉得我的压力会有多大012---How stressed do you think I am?
钱德勒012---Hey, Chandler.
你有空吗  我真的需要跟你谈一谈012---You got a minute? I really need to talk to you.
好  这场谈话是要配冷披萨012---Oh, yeah. Is this a coldpizza talk
还是配剩肉卷012---or a leftovermeat loaf talk?
都不是012---Well, neither.
天啊  发生了什么大事012---Oh, my God, what's up?
我不知道  只是...012---I don't know. It's just...
最近我觉得...012---Lately, I've been feeling...
好吧  事情是这样的012---Okay, here's what it is.
你知道吗  我觉得好多了  谢谢012---You know what? I feel a lot better. Thanks.
快回来告诉我012---Just come back.
好吧012---Okay.
你跟莫妮卡当了很久的朋友012---You and Monica, friends for a long time.
当然这是有规则的012---And sure, there are rules.
之后你们去了伦敦012---But then you went to London.
可是那不一样012---But that's different.
这也是有规则的  你理解我的意思吗012---There are rules there too, you know what I mean?
你自己理解吗012---Do you?
你们的情况和我不一样012---It was different for you guys.
你们刚好在同一个地方  对吧012---I mean, you were both in the same place, right? 
在伦敦  对012--- In London?  Yeah.
对  莫妮卡跟我在伦敦时我们刚好都在那里012---Yes, when Monica and I were in London, we were both in London.
我就不该来找你012---You know what. This is a bad idea.
算了  就当我什么都没说012---Forget it. Forget all about it.
帮我个忙  别把这件事说出去012---And listen, do me a favor, this conversation between you and me.
我会尽力的012---If that.
罗斯  别忘了明天我们要一起去产检012---Oh, Ross, don't forget we have that doctor's appointment tomorrow.
好  你们要知道宝宝的性别了吗012--- Right.  Hey, are you going to find out the sex of the baby?
不  我们不想知道012---No. We talked about it. We don't wanna know.
我们只在乎宝宝是不是健康快乐012---All we care about is that it's happy and healthy.
对  健康快乐  还有可爱012---Yep, happy and healthy. And cute.
聪明  万人迷012--- And smart.  Popular.
还要有科学精神012---With an aptitude for science.
你们两个说的是同一个宝宝吗012---Are you two talking about the same baby?
你们开始想名字了吗012---Hey, have you thought of names yet?
对  我想到一大堆012---Oh, yeah. I've come up with a bunch of ideas.
真的吗  我也是  我也是012--- Really? Me too.  Me too.
真的吗012---Really?
如果是女孩就叫菲比  如果是男孩就叫菲宝012---If it's a girl, Phoebe. And if it's a boy, Pheebo.
或许吧012---Maybe.
但多想些备用名字应该有益无害012---But it wouldn't hurt to have a backup, you know?
瑞秋  你都想到什么名字  好吧012--- Rach, what were you thinking?  Okay.
我想如果是女孩012---I was thinking if it's a girl...
叫她珊德妮好吗  这是法文012---...how about Sandrene? It's French.
很适合做工业溶剂公司的名字012---That's a really pretty name for an industrial solvent.
好吧  你想到什么012---Okay, fine. What do you have?
我想到一个男孩的名字012---It's for a boy.
我知道起这个名字有点疯狂012---I know it's a little out there, but...
达尔文012---...Darwin.
天啊  我们的孩子会在操场上被打死012---Oh, my God. Our child will be beaten to death in the schoolyard.
对  被珊德妮打死012---Yeah, by Sandrene.
你那么说是因为我不喜欢你想的名字012---You're just saying that because I said no to your name.
我是本来就不喜欢012---I'm really, really not.
你们各有五次否决权  如何012---How about you each get five vetoes?
听起来很公平012---That sounds fair.
不过我觉得你根本用不着否决  听着012---I don't think you'll need it though. Check this out.
如果是女孩就叫小雨012---If it's a girl, Rain.
否决012---Veto.
为什么012---Why?
小雨  "嗨  我叫小雨012---Rain? "Hi, my name is Rain.
我有自己的炉子  我的衣服是用麦子做的"012---I have my own kiln, and my dress is made out of wheat."
我认识她012---I know her!
我在死人秀里跟她买了一块手工肥皂012---I bought a homemade soap from her at a Dead show!
好  如果是男孩就叫撒切尔012---Okay. How about for a guy, Thatcher?
罗斯  你为什么那么恨我们的孩子012---Ross, why do you hate our child?
好吧  轮到你了  詹姆斯012--- Fine, you go.  Okay. James.
如果是女孩的话  否决012--- But only if it's a girl.  Veto.
我喜欢萝丝  你觉得呢012---How about... I like Ruth. What about Ruth?
抱歉  难道我们的宝宝89岁了吗012---Oh, I'm sorry. Are we having an 89yearold?
戴顿呢  否决  斯图亚特012--- How about Dayton?  Veto. Stewart.
否决  索耶012---Veto. Sawyer.
否决  海伦  否决012--- Veto. Helen.  Veto.
你们没觉得"否决"这个名字很好听吗012---Is it me, or is Veto starting to sound really good?
天啊  我为你准备了一个大惊喜012---Boy, do I have a surprise for you.
在阳台上做爱吗012---Sex on the balcony?
不  但某人一直放不下这个念头是吧012---No. But someone's really not gonna get over that idea, are they?
怎么了  我帮你放了洗澡水012--- What is it?  I drew you a bath.
我不喜欢泡澡012---I don't like baths.
你愿意跟我去阳台上做爱吗012---Could you draw me a picture of us having sex on the balcony?
拜托你试试看  我使出了全部绝招012---Please. Will you just try it for me. I used all my best stuff.
我点了蜡烛  放了音乐012---I lit some candles, I put on some music.
用了浴盐跟泡泡浴012---I used bath salts, plus bubble bath.
我还帮你找了个海军模型船012---And got you this little plastic Navy ship!
体现你的男性雄风012---So it's a boy bath.
确实稍微增添了点男人味012---This does butch it up a bit.
我发誓你试过后一定会爱上泡澡的012---I swear, if you try it, you will love it.
如果我答应泡澡012---If I do this,
我们能不能至少讨论在阳台上做爱的事012---can we at least discuss sex on the balcony?
当然可以012---Absolutely.
但我知道那场讨论会如何进行012---But I know how that discussiors gonna go.
好吧  还不赖012---All right, this isn't so bad.
我喜欢花香味012---I like the flowery smell.
这没什么不妥  因为我手上有船012---Which is okay, because I've got my boat.
怎么样  我的天啊012--- So?  Oh, my God.
我就说过你会喜欢泡澡嘛012---I told you you were a bath person.
等你洗完  我可以帮你做脸012---Hey, when you get out, maybe I can give you a facial.
我需要一艘更雄伟的船012---I'm gonna need a bigger boat.
我觉得你对萝丝这个名字不够开通012---I don't think you had an open mind about the name Ruth.
拜托嘛  小萝丝·盖勒  多可爱啊012---I mean, come on, little Ruthie Geller? How cute is that?
天啊  我仿佛听到了搓麻将的声音012---Oh, my God, I can practically hear the mahjong tiles.
好了  检查结果都很正常012---Okay. All your tests look fine.
你们想知道宝宝的性别吗012---Are you two interested in knowing the sex of the baby?
我们不想知道012---No, we're not.
但病历里面有记录012---But you have it right there in that file?
你可以告诉我们是男孩或是女孩012---You could tell us whether it's a boy or a girl?
戴顿或珊德妮  菲比或菲宝012---Dayton or Sandrene? Phoebe or Pheebo?
没错  如果你们不想知道012---That's right. But if you don't wanna know...
不  我们愿意等  对吧  对012--- No, we wanna wait. Right?  Right. Right.
我马上回来012---Oh, I'll be right back.
我知道自己不该多嘴012---I know it's really not my place...
但请不要给宝宝取名叫菲宝012---...but please don't name your child Pheebo.
你觉得哪个宝宝最丑012---So which of these babies do you think is the ugliest?
什么  瑞秋  你这么说太恶毒了012---What? Rach, come on, that's terrible.
他们是宝宝  都很可爱012---They're babies. They're all beautiful.
左起第三个012---Third one from the left?
对  他为什么要盯着我看012---Yeah. Why is it staring at me?
他大概知道我在说他坏话012---I think it knows I'm talking about it.
你不...  怎么了012--- Don't you...?  What?
你在偷看012---You're looking!
我没有  我看到了012--- I didn't!  I saw you!
好吧  我在偷看  但我什么都没有看到012---Fine, I did, but I didn't see anything. I swear.
你太可耻了  丑宝宝唾弃你012---Shame on you! Ugly baby judges you!
好吧  听我说  我没有...012---Okay. But Ross, listen to me, I didn't...
别告诉我  我不想知道012---No, no. Don't tell me! I don't wanna know!
我想说也没办法  因为我也不知道012---I couldn't even if I wanted to, because I don't know!
我发誓我什么都没看到012---I swear I didn't see anything!
我不想知道  刚刚我是一时糊涂012---I don't want to know. It was just a momentary lapse.
一时糊涂012---Momentary lapse?
你不懂得自制吗012---Don't you have any selfcontrol?
好吧  你要是能早几个月做这场说教就好了012---Okay. A couple months late on the lecture, Ross.
我回来了012---Hello?
我在浴室  你能进来一下吗012---I'm in the bathroom. Can you come in here?
我觉得不太对劲012---I think there's something wrong.
我还是在这里等着吧012---You know what? I think I'll wait out here.
我在浴缸里012---I'm in the bathtub.
怎么了012---What's wrong?
我自己放了洗澡水  但方法不对012---I drew my own bath, but I did it wrong.
水不冷不热  浴盐没有溶解012---The water's tepid, the salt didn't dissolve
现在都结块了012---and is now lodged places.
我用的几种香料闻起来很不协调012---And the scents I used don't compliment each other.
桉树加甘菊012---Eucalyptus and chamomile?
怎么了  浴盐012--- What?  Bath salts.
开始冒泡了012---They're starting to effervesce.
感觉完全不同012---It's different.
这感觉真有意思012---It's interesting.
好吧  我们谈谈别的事吧012---Okay. Let's talk about something else.
好  今天你过得还好吧012---Yeah. Sure. So, what was going on with you today?
乔伊今天跟我聊了一些很奇怪的事情012---I actually had the weirdest conversation with Joey.
他谈到规则  还有对错012---He was talking about rules and right and wrong.
我也跟他谈过这些012---I had the exact same conversation.
是吗  他到底在说什么012---You did? What was he talking about?
自从他演过《麦克白》之后012---I don't know. Joey hasn't had this much trouble
我还没见过他说不出话的样子012---getting out words since we saw him in Macbeth.
那可真是漫长的一夜012---That was a long night.
好吧  我们来分析一下012---All right, let's break this down.
他到底跟你说了什么012---What exactly did he say to you?
他说到规则012---Okay. He was talking about rules
对别人有了不同的感觉012---and looking at people differently.
他没有跟我说那个问题012---He didn't say anything about that to me.
他跟你说了什么012---What'd he tell you?
他问到你跟我在伦敦发生的事012---He was asking all this questions about you, me and London.
从头至尾都在谈规则012---And of course the glue that holds this all together, the rules.
好吧  你跟我在伦敦012---Okay. So you, me and London.
对别人有不同的感觉012---Looking at people differently.
或许他想跟某人发生你跟我在伦敦所做的事012---Maybe he wants to do what you and I did in London with someone.
但他说"规则"是什么意思012---But what'd he mean by "rules"?
等一下  菲比走进来时  他就不说了012---Wait a minute. He stopped talking the minute Phoebe came in.
因为他对她的感觉不同了012---Because he was looking at her differently.
菲比是他的朋友012---And Phoebe is his friend.
他觉得那样违反了规则012---So he thinks that would be breaking the rules.
天啊  他想跟菲比在伦敦上床012---My God, he wants to do it with Phoebe in London!
你们在哪里  等一下012--- You guys?  Just a minute!
崔比安尼太太来了012---That's Mrs. Tribbiani.
什么都别说012---You don't say anything.
我为什么要说012---Why would I say anything?
我们的两个好朋友012---That two of our friends could start
就要展开一段伟大恋情012---the greatest love affair of their lives?
他们将来可要谢我012---They would have me to thank.
然后我们可以一起开始怀孕生孩子012---Then we could all start having babies!
我不准你告诉她012---I'm not gonna let you say anything.
你就待在这里012---You just stay here.
天啊012---Oh, God!
莫妮卡  我拿熨斗来还你012---Hey, Monica, I brought back your iron.
是你拿走的吗  我还以为我弄丢了012---Oh, you had that? I thought I lost it.
一个月前  我买了个新的012---I got a new one a month ago.
太好了  我把这个弄坏了012---Oh, just as well. I broke this one.
怎么  没事012--- What?  Nothing.
好吧012---Okay.
我实在不该说  我不该说出来的012---I really shouldn't say. I'm really not supposed to.
好吧012---Fine.
这可是个好消息012---It's a humdinger.
可惜你不能告诉我012---Well, then it's really too bad that you can't tell me.
有人喜欢你012---Somebody likes you!
是钱德勒吗012---Is it Chandler?
不是  那叫他别再盯着我看了012--- No!  Then tell him to stop staring.
是乔伊012---It's Joey.
真的吗  乔伊  看不出来啊012---Really? Joey? You don't say.
你对他有意思吗012---Is it something you'd be interested in?
我不知道  我不知道012---I don't know, I don't know. I don't know.
我一方面会想"天啊  我可以跟他在一起吗"012---You know, I mean, on the one hand, "Mother, may I?"
但另一方面012---But, you know, on the other hand...
不行  我们是朋友012---No. No, I can't. We're friends.
不行  我不能拿我们现在的友谊冒险012---Oh, no. I don't wanna risk what we have.
你说得有道理012---I guess that makes sense.
你要跟他谈一谈吗012---You think you're gonna talk to him?
当然  他可是乔伊012---Sure. I mean, it's Joey.
我不希望他受伤害012---I don't want him to get hurt.
我简直是势不可挡啊012---Well, I must say, I am on fire!
先是钱德勒  现在又是乔伊012---First Chandler, now Joey.
没有钱德勒  只有乔伊  好吧012--- Not Chandler. Just Joey.  Sure.
你知道吗  我想过了012---You know what? I've been thinking about it.
我开始接受萝丝这个名字了012---I'm really coming around on the name Ruth.
我觉得可以考虑帮孩子取那个名字012---I think I would actually consider naming our child that.
瑞秋  这对我来说简直意义重大012---Rach, I can't tell you how much that means to me.
等一下012---Wait a minute.
等一下  你之前很讨厌萝丝这个名字012---Wait a minute. You hated the name Ruth.
你为什么会改变心意012---Why would you change your mind?
除非你知道我们根本用不上它012---Unless you know we're never gonna have to use it.
你看到病历了  知道自己怀的是男孩012---You did see the folder. You know it's a boy!
我什么都没有看到012---I didn't see anything.
我真的是改变了心意012---I actually changed my mind about the name.
我可不觉得  你答应让我选萝丝012---I don't think so. You're giving me Ruth...
如果你生了儿子 你就能帮他取名字了012---...so you get to name him when it's a boy.
到时候你会决定叫他海瑟012---That's when you'll swoop in and name him Heath
布兰恩或史奎亚012---or Blaine or Sequoia.
我会...史奎亚012---I would... Sequoia!
否决  好吧012--- Veto.  Fine.
除非...012---Unless...
你知道我会看穿你的阴谋012---...you anticipated that I would figure all this out...
而你知道自己怀的是女孩012---...and you know that it actually is a girl.
你真的希望她叫萝丝012---And you really do want her to be named Ruth.
我才不会上当  好吧012---Well, I'm not falling for that! Okay?
不要考虑萝丝了012---Ruth is off the table!
可是你想给孩子取这个名字啊012---But, Ross, you want the name Ruth.
我不会让你得逞012---Not like this!
怎么了012---What's up?
乔伊  我知道了  什么012--- Joey, I know.  What?
我知道了  什么012--- I know.  What?
我知道你的心思了012---I know about your feelings.
天啊  真的吗012---Oh, my God, did you?
对不起  虽然钱德勒跟莫妮卡终成眷属了012---Yes. I'm sorry. I know things worked out for Chandler and Monica,
但那是少之又少的例子012---but that's rare.
我知道  比起他们的情况012---I know. And this is so much more complicated
我的情况复杂多了012---than it was for those guys.
她可是瑞秋啊012---I mean, it's Rachel, for God's sakes.
天啊  是瑞秋012---For God's sakes, it's Rachel!
就是嘛  她不只是我的朋友012---I know! She's not only my friend,
她还怀孕了012---she's my pregnant friend.
她不仅怀孕了  还是罗斯的前女友012---She's my pregnant friend who's Ross' ex!
对  那是瑞秋012---Yeah, that's Rachel.
我哪能比得上她012---Beat me over the head with it.
我该怎么办012---What am I gonna do?
我努力克服对她的这种感觉012---I keep trying to get rid of these feelings.
昨晚我整夜没睡012---I stayed up all last night
写出所有我不喜欢她的地方012---and made a list of everything I don't like about her.
你想听听看吗  好012--- You wanna hear it?  Yeah.
"她要我改吃低卡美乃滋"012---"She made me switch to light mayo."
没了  我只想到这点012---That's it! That's all I got!
其实低卡的味道一样  而且我的裤腰变松了012---You know what? Tastes the same and my pants fit better.
乔伊  我觉得你是庸人自扰012---Joey, I think you're getting upset for nothing.
或许你对她只是一时好感012---This is probably just a crush.
你真的那么觉得吗012---You think?
没错  你对她顿生好感012---Absolutely. You get this rush of feelings,
但那种感觉会消失012---but then it goes away.
对  我对她只是一时好感012---Yeah, just a crush. That's all this is.
一时好感012---It's a crush!
我是乔伊  我才不会玩真的012---I'm Joey. I don't get deep feelings.
就是嘛  这种情况经常发生012---Right. There you go. Crushes happen all the time.
我对你们三个男生也有过那种感觉012---I know I've had them for all you guys.
除了罗斯跟钱德勒012---Except for Ross and Chandler.
我相信你对我们三个也是  不尽然012--- And I'm sure you've had them for us.  Not really.
你就不能可怜可怜我012---Throw me a bone here.
我打电话给医生了012---So I called the doctor.
现在我们都知道宝宝的性别了012---Now we both know the sex of the baby.
什么012---What?
没错  我青出于蓝胜于蓝012---That's right. The student has become the master.
罗斯  我发誓我真的不知道012---Ross, I swear. I don't know.
少来了  你知道是个女孩012---Oh, come on, you know it's a girl.
什么012---A what?
你真的不知道012---You really didn't know?
我们要有女儿了  不012--- We're having a girl?  No.
你就是那么说的  不012--- That's what you said.  No.
你说是女孩  是  我真的很抱歉012--- You said girl.  Yes. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
没关系  我们要有女儿了012---I'm not! We're having a girl!
有时候我不敢相信孩子他爸是你012---Sometimes I can't believe it's with you,
但我们要有女儿了012---but still, we're having a girl!
我知道  你知道吗012---I know! You know what?
我要重新考虑萝丝这个名字012---I'm putting Ruth back on the table.
好  我们要生下小萝丝了012---Yes, we'll have ourselves a little baby Ruth.
请求否决  好吧  否决012--- Permission to veto.  Yes, please.
这是精油味吗012---Do I smell essential oils?
对  我要泡澡  我先去拿本杂志012---Yeah. I'm gonna take a bath. I was just gonna get a magazine.
好012---Okay.
你这是干嘛呢012---What do you think you're doing?
忘却烦恼012---Leaving my troubles behind?
我知道你是新手012---I know that you're new at this,
但这不合乎泡澡的礼仪012---but this is unacceptable bath decorum.
身心如此放松  我还哪顾得上那么多礼仪012---It's so hard to care when you're this relaxed.
好吧  你可以泡澡  但我要拿走你的船012---Okay, fine. You can have the bath, but I am taking your boat.
现在你只是个爱洗澡的女生012---Now you're just a girl in a tub.
泡泡浴  太有男子气概了012---Hi, bubbles. Manly.
我想顺道过来012---I thought I would drop by
告诉你我和乔伊的结果012---and let you know how it went with Joey.
你跟她说了012---You told her?
是她自己问出来的012---She pulled it out of me!
她真的很会套别人的话012---She's like a conversational wizard!
结果如何012---How did it go?
你错了  他不喜欢我  什么012--- You were wrong. He doesn't like me.  What?
如果我让你去找李·梅杰斯012---Yeah. How would you like it if I sent you to Lee Majors' house...
我告诉你他喜欢你  结果你跑过去012---...and I told you he liked you and you went there...
发现他根本不喜欢你012---...and you found out that he didn't like you.
你会有什么感觉012---How would you feel?
我不会在乎012---I don't think I'd care.
真的吗  李梅杰很性感012---Really? Lee Majors is hot.
有人吗  我们在浴室里012--- Hello?  We're in the bathroom!
为什么  因为现在是放松享受时间012--- Why?  Because it's a relaxing and enjoyable time!
你们在这里做什么  天啊012--- What are you guys doing in here?  Oh, my God.
他对一个朋友有了不同的感觉  但不是菲比012---A friend he's looking at differently, but it's wrong.
是瑞秋  你喜欢瑞秋012--- It's Rachel!  You like Rachel?
这不是什么大事  菲比跟我谈过012---Look. It's no big deal, okay? Phoebe and I talked about it.
我对她只是一时好感  这种感觉会消失的012---It's just a crush. It's gonna go away.
哥们  你该拿泡泡遮一遮了012---Dude, you gotta rearrange your bubbles.
恭喜你012---Mazel tov.
我和罗斯在找你们012---Ross and I were looking for you.
我们都在这里做什么  天啊012---What are we all doing in here? Oh, my.
亲爱的  用船遮遮羞012---Honey, cover it up with the boat.
有人吗012---Hello?
我们都在这里  欢迎你加入我们012---Yes. We're all in here, and we'd love for you to join us!
发生了什么事012---Well, hey! What's going on?
船不错啊  看错了012---Oh, cool boat. Oh, no.
你告诉他们了吗  没有  我在等你012--- Did you tell them?  No. I was waiting for you.
告诉我们什么  我怀的是女儿012--- Tell us what?  We're having a girl.
哇  真的吗012---Oh, wow! Really?
我待会再跟你们一起庆祝012---I'll get you later.
好吧  又是全新的一天012---All right. It's a new day.
那只是一时好感012---And it's just a crush.
没错  只是一时好感012---That's all. Just a little crush.
我到底在担心什么  简直不可理喻012---All that worrying I was doing? That was crazy. Crazy.
就像这只小鸟朋友说的那样  "太疯狂了"012---Like my friend the bird here would say, "It was cuckoo!" 
一切都会没事  那只是一时好感012---Everything's gonna be fine. It's just a crush.
嗨  亲爱的  我爱你012--- Hi, sweetie.  I love you.
洗鸳鸯浴感觉很棒吧012---It's nice to do this together, isn't it?
对  你让我感觉非常好012---Yeah. And what you're doing feels so good.
我没有碰你012---I'm not touching you.
是吗  是浴盐在起作用012--- You're not?  It's the salts.
天啊  简直是享受新境界012---Oh, sweet Lord, new realms of pleasure.
只要能让你忘记阳台的事就行  大男人012---Whatever keeps you off the balcony, big guy.
怎么了012---What's up?
我又忘拿吉他了012---I left my guitar here again.
好吧  没问题  好012--- Okay. No problem.  Okay.
好了  拿去吧012---Okay. Here you go.
好  好012--- Okay.  Okay.
怎么了  你想一起玩点什么吗012--- What?  You want to hang out or something?
菲比  你来的不是时候012---Phoebe. You caught me at a bad time.
你跟钱德勒...  没错012--- Are you and Chandler...?  Yes. Exactly.
好吧  要我帮你们伴奏吗  不必了012--- Okay. Do you guys want me to play for you?  No.
菲比  你好吗012---Hey, Pheebs, what's up?
你问了一个引人深思的问题  钱德勒·宾012---You ask an intriguing question, Chandler Bing.
天啊  你竟然请人帮你按摩012---Oh, my God! You're getting a massage?
你从来不让我帮你按摩012---You never let me massage you.
菲比  我可以解释012---Phoebe, I can explain.
你说过你讨厌按摩012---You told me you hate massages.
去买邮票  取干洗的衣服012---Buy stamps. Pick up dry cleaning.
别让菲比进来012---Don't let Phoebe in.
真不敢相信  你背着我这么做多久了012---I can't believe this! How long has this been going on?
亚丽珊卓...012---Well, Alexandra has...
她还有名字啊012---It has a name?
菲比  别生气012---Phoebe, don't get upset.
好吧  太迟了  我要走了012---Okay. Oh, too late! I'm leaving.
来吧  钱德勒  我们走012---Come on, Chandler, let's go.
我还是...012---Well, I thought I'd...
好吧  管它呢012---Yeah, what the hell.
《老友记》  第八季  第14集  神秘的储藏室012---Friends S08E14 The One With The Secret Closet
好了  继续用力  加油012---Oh okay, okay! One more push! One more push!
加油  亲爱的  就快生出来了012---Come on honey, we're almost there! We're almost there!
乔伊  真高兴我们能在一起012---Joey, I'm happy things worked out for us
我们就要有自己的孩子了012---and we're having this baby together.
我如此爱你012---I love you so much.
我也爱你012---I love you too.
希望现在说这种话不会太煞风景...012---I hope it's not an inappropriate time to say this...
你是我最棒的性伴侣012---...you're the best sex I've ever had.
这种话随时都可以说012---That's always appropriate.
来吧  继续用力  继续用力012---Okay, come on, one more push. One more push.
好了012---There we go.
你们的漂亮宝宝012---Here is your beautiful baby.
恭喜012---Congratulations.
希望你做爸爸比做朋友称职012---I hope you're a better father than you are a friend!
乔伊  怎么了012--- Joey! Joey!  What?
发生了什么事  快来摸摸我的肚子012--- What's going on?  Come feel my belly.
这是宝宝第一次踢我012---The baby's kicking for the first time.
你过来摸摸嘛012---Will you please come feel this?
真的吗  对012--- Really?  Yes.
要不还是你...012---You know what? Maybe you...
还是你过来吧  我没穿裤子012---Maybe you should come to me. I'm not wearing any bottoms.
天啊012---Oh, my God.
太不可思议了012---It's unbelievable!
她踢得好用力  她就像是...012---Wow, she is kicking so much. She's like...
那个讨厌的女足球员是谁来着012---Who's that kind of annoying girl soccer player?
米亚·汉姆  米亚·汉姆012--- Mia Hamm?  Mia Hamm!
太神奇了  一只手抓好床单  乔伊012--- It's amazing.  One hand on the sheet, Joe.
抱歉012---Sorry.
宝贝  亲爱的012--- Hey, babe.  Hey, honey.
刚收到巴伯跟菲伊宾送我们的结婚礼物012---We got a wedding gift from Bob and Faye Bing.
他们不喜欢我们  对吧012---They don't like us, do they?
谁说买不到六块以下的高级酒碗012---Who says you can't get a nice punch bowl for under $6?
我们可以退回去012---Maybe we can take it back.
上面都没写地址  怎么知道要退到哪里去012---No, it doesn't say where it came from. Where would we return it?
何不从阳台把它丢到街上012---How about to the street, from the balcony?
还是找个地方摆着吧012---Why don't we just find a place for it?
放在那个储藏室里怎样012---How about that cabinet?
那是放罐头食物的012---No. That's for canned goods.
你忘了每样东西都要放在固定位置吗012---Have you forgotten everything you learned at orientation?
那浴室旁边的储藏室呢012---How about the closet by the bathroom?
让我来吧  不  我来就行了012--- Okay. Let me do it.  No, I'll do it.
亲爱的  你得学会放手012---Honey, you have to learn to sit down and relax
偶尔把事情交给我来做012---and let your husband take care of things once and awhile.
上锁了  你得帮帮我012---It's locked. You have to help me.
为什么上锁了012---Why is it locked?
没有为什么  我把私人物品放在那里012---No reason. I keep private things in there.
我在这里住了一阵子了012---I've been here a while,
从没见过里面放的是什么东西012---and I've never seen what's inside that closet.
里面到底放了什么012---What is in there?
女性用品012---Feminine stuff.
你别以为说是女性用品就能唬住我012---Don't try to make me uncomfortable with feminine stuff!
钱德勒  那里面没有你喜欢的东西012---Chandler, there is nothing in there that concerns you!
你要是爱我  就忘了这件事吧012---If you love me, you'll just let it go.
好吧  谢谢012--- Fine.  Thank you.
爱你012---Love you.
钱德勒  今天天气真好啊012---Hello, Chandler. Lovely day, huh?
那谁012---You.
如果这话有帮助的话012---Phoebe, if it helps,
亚丽珊卓只帮她做了三年按摩012---Alexandra's only been massaging Monica for three years.
我说如果有帮助的话012---If! I said, if it helps.
你为什么不让我帮你按摩012---Why won't you let me massage you?
我会觉得尴尬012---I mean I'd just... I'd be selfconscious.
你是我朋友  我得脱光衣服012---You're my friend. I'd be naked.
莫妮卡  我们住在一起那么多年012---Monica, we lived together for years.
我看过你没穿衣服的样子012---I've seen you naked.
那不一样  我们当时是室友012---That's different. We were roommates.
你什么时候见过012---And when?
我对人体很好奇012---I'm curious about the human body.
菲比  你肯定明白我为什么会觉得别扭012---Come on, Phoebe. You can understand why this would be weird for me.
我是职业按摩师  技术一流012---I'm a professional and I'm really good.
如果你觉得不舒服  我就住手012---If you're uncomfortable, we can stop.
给我一个机会  拜托012---Just give me a chance. Please? Okay?
好吧  如果你这么看重这点的话012---Okay. If it means that much to you.
没错012---It does.
如果你没法分享你的厨艺  你会有什么感觉012---How would you feel if you couldn't share your cooking?
如果罗斯不能教我们012---Or imaging how Ross would feel
龙的知识他会有什么感觉012---if he couldn't teach us about dragons.
是恐龙  有什么区别012--- Dinosaurs.  Potato, potahto.
罗斯  宝宝会动了012---Ross, the baby's kicking.
什么  是吗012---What? It is?
她现在没在踢我012---It's not kicking right now.
不过我们倒是很想看你再摘一次手套012---Although we would love to see you do that again.
她什么时候动的  怎么回事012---When? When was it kicking? What happened?
昨晚我感觉到了  就跑到乔伊房间012---Last night. I just felt it and I went into Joey's room,
他在睡觉  但是没做梦012--- and he was sleeping.  A dreamless sleep.
天啊  宝宝会动了  真是太棒了012---My God, the baby's kicking. That's great.
不过我希望宝宝第一次胎动的时候012---Although I kind of wish I would have been there to feel
我能陪在你身边012---the kicking for the first time.
如果你真的想摸  我的肚子正在咕咕叫呢012---I got some stuff going on if you want to feel.
我不想再错过宝宝的一举一动了012---Look, I don't want to miss any more baby stuff.
这是我的新传呼号码012---So here's my pager number, okay?
只要发生跟宝宝有关的事立刻通知我012---Anytime anything pregnancyrelated happens, use it.
我随时恭候  凌晨三点也无所谓012---I'll be there. I don't care if it's three in the morning,
哪怕你只是想吃冰淇淋012---and all you want is ice cream.
我能抄一份吗012---Can I get a copy of that?
你裹上床单吗  对012--- Are you under the sheet?  Yes.
好了  我们开始吧012---Great, let's begin.
力道还可以吧012---How's the pressure?
很不错  菲比  你确实很厉害012---It's nice. Wow, Phoebe, you are good.
这是明摆着的事  不过还是谢谢夸奖012---Stating the obvious, but thank you.
一点都不奇怪  对吧  没错012--- And it's not weird, is it?  No.
没错  好好享受吧012---That's right, you just enjoy.
爽012---Oh, yeah!
爽啊  好吧012--- Oh, yeah!  Okay.
天啊  菲比012---Oh, God, Phoebe!
就这样  就是那里012---That's it! That's it, right there!
我没想打开你的储藏室012---I wasn't trying to open your closet.
我发誓  我没想打开你的储藏室012---I wasn't trying to open your closet, I swear.
莫妮卡管你很严  对吧012---Monica runs a pretty tight ship here, doesn't she?
你在做什么012---What are you doing?
莫妮卡有个秘密储藏室  她不肯让我看012---Monica has a secret closet. She won't let me see what's in it.
为什么  我不知道012--- Why not?  I don't know!
她能有什么要藏着不让我看的012---What could she possibly be hiding in here that I can't see?!
我不知道012---I don't know.
我敢说是理查德012---I bet it's Richard.
她为什么要把理查德关在里面012---Why would Monica be keeping Richard in here?
我的第一反应是012---Off the top of my head...
或者她想鱼与熊掌兼得012---...maybe she's having her cake and eating it too.
你是"熊掌"  理查德只是"鱼"012---You being the "cake," Richard being the "too."
或是...  又来了012--- Or...  And here we go.
我看过一部电影里有一扇门012---I saw this movie once where there was a door
没有人知道里面藏了什么012---Nobody knew what was behind it.
最后他们把门打开之后012---When they finally got it open,
数以百万只虫子蜂拥而出012---millions and millions and millions of bugs came pouring out
以人肉为食012---and they feasted on human flesh.
尊重你老婆的隐私要不了你的命012---It wouldn't kill you to respect your wife's privacy!
满是虫子的破储藏室012---Stupid closet full of bugs!
乔伊  我感觉怪怪的  不太对头012---Joey. Joey, something feels weird and not good weird.
我不...012---I don't...
别担心  没事012---Do not worry, ok?
我妹妹怀孕的时候012---When my sisters were pregnant...
她们有各种奇怪的感觉012---they got every weird feeling in the book,
结果根本没事012---and it was always nothing.
真的吗  没错012--- Really?  Absolutely.
但我们得到医院检查一下  确保没事012---But we'll stop by the hospital just to be sure.
我在路上呼罗斯  好012--- I'll page Ross on the way.  Okay. God!
瑞秋  看着我012---Okay Rach, Rach, Rach look at me, look at me,
一切都会没事的  相信我012---everything's gonna be fine, trust me. Okay.
来  握着我的手  我们走吧012---Come on. Take my hand. Here we go.
我快骨折了012---Crushing bones!
还好我们是要去医院012---Good thing we're going to a hospital.
怎么样  她没事012--- So?  She's fine.
她出现了假性子宫收缩012---She's experiencing BraxtonHicks contractions,
引起了子宫壁的轻度不适012---mild discomfort caused by contractions in the uterine wall.
轻度不适012---Mild discomfort?
这么说你也出现过假性宫缩喽012---So I take it you've had one of these Braxton thingies?
一切都正常吗  对012--- But everything's normal?  Absolutely.
她和宝宝都没有危险  对012--- And there's no danger to her or the baby?  No.
如果不明情况  宫缩会引起不安情绪012---Contractions can be unnerving if you don't know what they are,
但她没事012---but she's fine.
谢谢你  医生012---Thank you, doctor.
谢谢你这么好心冷静012---And thank you for being nice and calm.
我一点都不冷静012---Calm? I wasn't calm!
我从来没有这么害怕过012---I've never been more scared in my entire life.
你说一切都会没事的012---But wait you said everything was gonna be okay.
我知道什么  我又不是医生012---What do I know? I'm not a doctor.
但一切都没事  我很好啊  你确定012--- But everything is okay. I'm fine.  You sure?
对  我真希望那个医生的子宫也会收缩012---Yes. I got half a mind to contract that doctor's uterus though.
轻度不适  他没经历过  有什么资格发言012---Mild discomfort! What's he talking about?
你没事吧  没事012--- Is everything okay?  Yes, everything's fine.
你呼我说"赶到医院来"  发生了什么事012---Your page said, "Come to the hospital." What happened?
她出现了假性子宫收缩012---Something called Braxton Hicks contraction.
那没什么大不了的012---Thank god. That's no big deal.
很多女人都不会有感觉012---Most women don't feel them.
没有子宫就没有发言权012---No uterus, no opinion.
你买糖果干嘛  你呼我的时候012--- What's with the candy?  When you beeped me,
我正在电影院买零食012---I was at the concession stand at the movie theater.
你自己去看电影吗  蒙娜012--- You went to the movies by yourself?  Mona!
我得回检查室去012---I gotta go back in there.
发生了什么事012---Why? What's wrong?
没事  我只是得回去...012---No, everything's fine. I just gotta go back...
不  告诉我  怎么了012---No, really, tell me. What's up?
我把内裤落在里面了012---Look, I forgot my underwear.
谢谢你送她来医院012---Thanks so much for bringing her to the hospital.
别放在心上  没有什么大不了012---Don't worry about it. No big deal.
但应该由我送她来  我毕竟是孩子他爸012---But still, it should have been me. I'm the dad.
如果还有疑问012---If you have any questions,
这是假性宫缩的资料  谢谢012--- Here's information on Braxton Hicks.  Thanks.
对了  你送她过来是对的012---By the way, you did the right thing by bringing her in.
你会是个好爸爸012---You'll make a wonderful father.
我没有这家伙厉害  他买了糖果012---Hey, not as good as this guy. He brought Twizzlers.
一定会有办法012---There has got to be a way.
别紧张  寇克船长012---Easy there, Captain Kirk.{\r}\N{\fnTahoma\fs10\bord1\shad1\1c&HC0C0C0&\b0}
你有发夹吗  有012--- Do you have a bobby pin?  Yeah.
不对  我不是九岁的小女孩012---Oh, no, wait. I'm not a 9yearold girl.
那为什么你投球的时候很像012---Then why do you throw like one?
或许莫妮卡有发夹012---Maybe Monica has a bobby pin.
是啊  "莫妮卡"什么都有012---Oh, sure, "Monica."
你暗恋瑞秋那事怎么样了012---So, how's the hideously inappropriate crush on Rachel coming?
很不错  我该随时做好自杀的准备012---Really good. I should be ready to kill myself any day now.
你这么快就找到了012---Well, you sure found that quick.
我真希望对瑞秋的感觉能淡去012---I wish I didn't feel this way about Rachel any more.
我希望一切能恢复正常012---I wish things could go back to normal.
我喜欢跟她一起住012---I love living with her,
在怀孕期间照顾她感觉也很棒012---and helping out with the baby is amazing.
但罗斯会觉得自己像个局外人012---But now I think Ross feels left out.
我送瑞秋去医院012---When I took Rachel to the hospital,
医生还以为我是孩子他爸012---the doctor thought I was the father.
罗斯的表情很不自然012---You should have seen the look on Ross' face.
我不知道自己在干嘛012---By the way, I have no idea what I'm doing here.
我只知道锁越捅越紧012---For all I know, I'm just locking it more.
你试过用信用卡吗012---Did you try opening it with a credit card?
好点子  好012--- That's a good idea.  Okay.
罗斯有点失落是吧012---So Ross is kind of bummed, huh?
我感觉很过意不去  那不是你的错012--- I feel terrible.  It's not your fault.
不然你要怎么做  不送她去医院吗012---What are you gonna do, not take her to the hospital?
你没做错事012---You're doing nothing wrong.
但你不该爱上012---Except for harboring an all consuming love
怀着他孩子的女人012---for the woman whose carrying his baby.
理查德  如果你在里面012---Richard, if you're in there,
麻烦把信用卡递给我012---could you pass me my credit card?
你昨天的技术真的很棒012---I gotta tell you, yesterday was amazing.
按摩感觉舒服极了012---That massage felt so good.
我懂的012---No, I got that.
你能每星期帮我按摩一次吗012---So, what do you say we make it a weekly appointment?
好吧012---Okay.
但你得知道  我的时薪涨到两百块了012---You should know though, I've raised my rates to $200 an hour.
好吧  我是说五百块012--- Okay.  I mean 500.
什么  六百块012--- What?  600.
怎么回事012---What's going on?
我给你按摩你的时候  你会发出叫床声012---You make sex noises when you get massaged.
什么  我一下子就乱了手脚012--- What?  Yeah, and it really freaked me out!
之后我想用力弄痛你012---And after a while I even tried to hurt you
结果你叫得更大声012---and it just spurred you on.
你疯了吧012---What? You're crazy.
我的叫声一点都不淫荡012---There's nothing sexual about the noises I make.
是吗  这样一点都不淫荡吗012---Really? There's nothing sexual about this?
天啊012---Oh, God!
你看什么看012---What are you looking at?
我是说  嗨012---I mean, hi.
这简直太丢脸了012---This is so embarrassing.
我再也不按摩了012---Oh, my god. I'm never getting a massage again.
别让这个问题害你放弃按摩012---No, you can't let this stop you from getting massages.
我有很多客人012---Look, I have lots of clients
也会发出那种叫声012---that make the same noises as you do.
真的吗  他们不是客人  是床伴012--- Really?  Well, not clients. Lovers.
我们再试一次012---We'll try it again.
再来找我  我们想办法解决012---Come back, and we'll work through it.
你确定  对012--- You sure?  Yes.
好吧  太棒了  失陪一下012--- I guess.  Great! Now, if you'll just excuse me.
你刚才听到你中意的声音了吗012---So did you hear something you liked?
罗斯  你看  我学到了新把戏012---Hey, Ross, check it out! I learned a new trick.
我帮你买了午餐012---Hey, I brought you some lunch.
你真的太贴心了  美味啊012---Oh, that's so sweet of you. Oh, yum.
你放了腌黄瓜吗  对012--- Did you put pickles on this?  Well, yeah.
怎么  瑞秋  怎么了012---What? What? Rach, what?
发生了什么事012---What's going on?
我帮她带了最爱吃的腌黄瓜金枪鱼三明治012---I made her favorite, tuna salad with pickles.
腌黄瓜  那会让她恶心012---Pickle? Pickle makes her sick.
让她吃腌黄瓜就像让我吃沙拉012---Giving her pickle is like giving me salad.
抱歉  我不知道  你还好吗012---I'm sorry Rach, I didn't know. Are you gonna be okay?
我没事012---Yeah, I'll be fine,
趁我不在  谁能赶紧把那个三明治012---But could someone please make sure that sandwich is gone
给解决掉  我在吃了012--- when I get out there?  I'm on it!
怎么会这样012---I can't believe this.
我不该惹她恶心的012---I shouldn't be the one making her throw up.
放轻松  罗斯  谁都可能做出这种事012---Relax, Ross. It could happen to anyone.
你就不会  因为你了解她012---Yeah, not to you. 'Cause you know this stuff.
我什么都不知道  亏我还是孩子他爸012---I don't know any of it and I'm the father.
真希望自己能更多地参与其中012---I wish I could be more involved, you know?
谁帮我记下来012---Well, if anyone is keeping score,
我绝不会再吃金枪鱼了012---I no longer eat tuna.
我能跟你们谈一谈吗012---Can I talk to you guys for a second?
可以啊  怎么了012--- Yeah.  What's up?
坐吧  我想谈谈我们现在的情况012---Sit down. I wanna talk about our situation.
你要跟我们分手吗012---Are you breaking up with us?
我想说的是...012---The thing is...
因为我跟瑞秋一起住  我参与了不少事情012---...because I live with Rachel, I'm here for a lot of stuff.
而罗斯却不断错过  所以012---And Ross is missing everything. So...
怎么了012---Yeah?
也许你们两个应该住在一起012---Maybe you two should live together.
你要我搬出去吗  你不想让我住在这里了012---Are you asking me to move out? You don't want me here?
不是  我喜欢跟你一起住  只不过...012---No, I love living with you. It just seems that...
要找室友  也最好是孩子他爸012---...if you're gonna have a roommate, it may as well be the father.
乔伊  我觉得罗斯不希望012---But, Joey, I don't think Ross wants me to move into his apartment
我搬过去干扰他的生活012---and disrupt his life like that.
或许他希望我搬过去012---Or he does.
我很乐意照顾你跟宝宝012---I would love to be around for you and the baby.
我们可以先试一阵子012---We can just try it, like on a temporary basis.
但咱们有太多过往012---But Ross, it's you and me.
对  但我们不会有感情牵扯012---Sure, but it wouldn't be anything romantic.
我在和蒙娜交往  该死  又把蒙娜忘了012---I'm dating Mona. Damn it, Mona!
我跟她约好一小时前见面012---I was supposed to meet her an hour ago.
我这是怎么了012---What is wrong with me?
你们意下如何012---So, what do you think?
我不知道  那很疯狂吧  不012--- I don't know. Is it crazy?  No, no, it's not...
乔伊  这是个聪明点子012---Joey, this is a smart idea.
我早该想到的012---Well, I was due.
就这么办吧  我搬过去012---Okay, let's do it. I'll move in.
真的吗  对012--- Really?  Yeah.
瑞秋  那真是太棒了012---Rach, that's great. That's great.
还不赖嘛  我自己就把这玩意卸下来了012---Not too shabby. I got this all off myself...
用我老婆的工具012---...using my wife's tools.
我的天啊012---Oh, my God.
你是怎么把它打开的012---How did you get in there?
你很邋遢012---You're messy.
不  你不该看到这个场面的012---No! You weren't supposed to see this!
我娶了弗雷德·山福德（垃圾场主）012---I married Fred Sanford.
钱德勒  你不了解012---No, Chandler, you don't understand.
好吧  现在你知道了012---Okay, okay, fine! Now you know, okay?
我很病态  不  老婆  你不病态012--- I'm sick.  No, honey, you're not sick.
我爱你不是因为你井井有条012---Look, I don't love you because you're organized.
不论如何  我都爱你012---I love you in spite of that.
真的吗012---Really?
你发誓不会告诉任何人  对012--- Promise you won't tell anyone?  Yes.
既然我知道了  那如果我有多余的东西012---And look, now that I know if I got some extra stuff lying around,
可以也放进那个储藏室吗012---can we share the closet?
可是...012---Well... It's just...
我怕你会把里面弄乱012---I'm afraid you might mess it up.
瑞秋彻底搬出去了  你还好吧012---So Rachel's all moved out? How you taking it?
我本想喝几瓶啤酒  但我把啤酒都丢了012---I wanted to have a few beers, but I got rid of those
因为瑞秋受不了那个味道012---because Rachel couldn't stand the smell of them.
我买了不少加钙的柳橙汁012---I have thrown back a lot of orange juice with calcium.
已经过期几星期了012---It's a couple weeks past its expiration date,
所以会有点酒精的效力012---so it's got a bit of a kick.
你没事吧012---Are you okay?
开什么玩笑  我棒极了012---You kidding me? Yeah, I'm great.
我好到不能再好  我很好012---I'm better than great. I am good.
现在她搬走了012---Now that she's gone,
我可以做以前不能做的事了012---I can do stuff around here that I couldn't do before.
譬如...012---Like...
我又能脱光衣服到处走了012---I can walk around naked again.
我可以...012---I can...
我可以在客厅看黄片012---I can watch porn in the living room.
这对我来说是件好事012---This is good for me.
我喜欢一个人过日子  我喜欢这个样子012---I like being on my own. I'm better off this way.
我是一匹孤独的狼012---I'm a lone wolf.
我是个孤单的硬汉012---A loner. Alone.
永远都是一个人012---All alone. Forever.
狼都哀嚎成这样了  怎么还没人给个拥抱呢012---What's a wolf gotta do to get a hug around here?
好了  放轻松012---That's it, just relax.
加油  再来  天啊012--- Come on, more.  Oh, God!
你喜欢那样  对吧012---You like that, don't you?
对  就是那里012---Yeah, right there.
你要吗  我这就给你  宝贝012---Want it there? Take it there, baby.
菲比  对  喊我的名字  快点012--- Phoebe?  Yeah, say my name. Say it.
现在我要帮你盖上被子012---And now I'm going to cover you back up.
我接下来几周不会再跟你说话了012---And I won't be speaking with you for several weeks.
嗨  瑞秋012---Hey, Rach!
情人节快乐  你也是012--- Happy Valentine's Day!  You too!
跟罗斯住的感觉如何012---Hey, so, uh, how's it going living over at Ross'?
很不错012---It's good,
只不过他逼我们整天看探索频道012---except he makes us watch the Discovery Channel all day long.
你知道一个中世纪的丑八怪012---Did you know that something really boring happened
经历过一件很无聊的事吗012---to someone ugly in the Middle Ages.
谢谢  待会见012---Oh, thank you. I'll see you guys later.
好  再见  再见012--- Okay, bye.  Bye.
那杯外带咖啡真是幸运012---That is one lucky togo cup of coffee.
亲爱的  我希望你能忘了她012---Honey, I wish you would get over her.
我讨厌看到你这个样子012---I hate seeing you like this.
有什么我能帮上忙的吗012---Is there anything I can do for you?
你想看看我的胸部吗012---Do you wanna look down my top?
谢谢  以后再说吧012---Thanks. Maybe later.
甘瑟  给我来块烤饼干吧  你要什么012--- Gunther, can I get a scone?  You want anything?
我想要的东西多了去了012---You know what I want? I want a lot of things.
我希望跟我心爱的女人共度情人节012---I wanna be with the woman I love on Valentine's Day.
我希望她也同样爱我012---I want her to love me back.
知道我们永不可能在一起  令我痛彻心扉012---And I want just one moment of relief from the gutwrenching pain
我希望能从这种痛苦中有片刻解脱012---of knowing that that's never going to happen!
我们有红色百吉饼012---We have red bagels.
好吧012---Okay.

蒙娜对瑞秋搬过去有什么看法012---So, how does Mona feel about you and Rachel living together?
我正要告诉她012---Oh, I'm actually on my way to tell her right now.
她一整个星期都在父母家待着012---Yeah, she's been away all week visiting her parents,
但她会接受的  她一直都很支持我012---but she'll be cool. She's been so supportive.
她甚至帮宝宝买了件小T恤012---She even got the baby a tiny Tshirt that says
上面写着"化石是我朋友"012---"Fossils are my friends."
少来了  蒙娜  别拍马屁012---Come on, Mona. Don't kiss ass.
我得走了012---So I'm gonna take off.
糟糕  瑞秋想看这卷录影带012---Oh, shoot! Oh, shoot! Rachel wanted to see this tape.
那是什么  我朋友生孩子的录影带012--- What is it?  It’s a video of my friend giving birth.
你能带回家给她吗012---Could you take it to your apartment?
"糖果与饼干"012---"Candy and Cookie"?

少来了  我是你哥哥  问我吧012---Come on, I'm your older brother. Ask me.
好吧  哥哥012---Okay, big brother.
你觉得你妹妹穿哪一件012---Which of these do you think would make
会更惹火012---your little sister look hotter,
让你的铁哥们更想干她012---so your best friend would want to do her?
红色那件012---The red one.
我知道你最近很沮丧012---Look, I know you've been really depressed lately,
所以我带了样东西来帮你打气012---so I brought someone to cheer you up.
现在门外就有一位活生生  毛茸茸的玩物012---Right outside is a real, live, furry playmate.
我不要再跟你朋友珍上床了012---No, I'm not sleeping with your friend Jane again.
是狗狗012---Hey, a dog!
你得承认  它长得有点象珍012---Who, you gotta admit, looks a lot like Jane.
这是世上最开心乐观的狗狗012---This is the happiest dog in the world.
我问朋友温蒂借来的012---I borrowed him from my friend Wendy.

这是我看过最难看的黄片012---Worst porn ever! Worst porn ever!
快停下来  我在试呢012--- Oh, make it stop!  I am trying!
接球  准备好了吗  去接球012---Get the ball. Ready? Get the ball!
你很可爱  但脑袋可不怎么灵光012---You're cute, but you're not too smart.
这是我刚刚扔的吗012---Did I just throw this?
我不小心把这些跟我的东西混在一起带走了012---I accidentally packed these with my stuff.
这是谁啊  菲比朋友的狗012--- Who is this?  That's Phoebe's friend's dog.
我不知道它叫什么名字  我叫它马苏里拉（奶酪）012---I don't know what his real name is. I call him Mozzarella.
你好可爱  我希望能留下来陪你玩012---You are so cute. I wish I could play with you more,

我真的很想她012---I really miss her.
你应该了解吧  你是男生012---Hey, you understand, right? You're a guy.
你曾经是012---Well, you used to be.
你觉得怎样012---So, what do you think?
我还是很惹火012---I've still got it.
你为什么要给我租这个  那是什么012--- Why did you get me this?  What is it?
里面充斥着尖叫  鲜血跟阴道扩张012---It's yelling, bleeding, dilating.
阴道扩张012---Oh, the dilating!
这是纪录生产的录影带012---Is this the video of the baby being born?

如果你以为我会在情人节帮你租黄片...012---Chandler, If you thought I was gonna get you porn for Valentine's Day...
那么你说对了012---...you were right.
片中的女主角012---Apparently It's about a young girl
跑到大都市来追寻星梦012---who moves to the city in search of stardom...
最后跟很多男人上了床012---...but ends up having sex with a lot of guys.
它有四星级的评价012---It got four stars.
等一下  那些不是星星012---Wait a minute. Those aren't stars.
你要看一下吗012---Anyway, you wanna take a look?
我现在非常没有性致012---I'm not really in a sexy mood right now.
发生了什么事012---Hey, what's going on?
还记得你第一次看大白鲨...012---Remember the first time you saw Jaws...
你花了多长时间才敢再下水游泳012---...how long it took to go back in the water?
我们不能让这卷录影带毁了情人节012---We can't let this tape wreck Valentine's Day.
你不了解情况  你又没看过012---Okay. You don't know. You didn't see it.
生孩子是很自然的一件事  过程很美012---Childbirth is a natural thing. It's beautiful.
很美  真的吗012---Oh, beautiful? Really?
你觉得这叫美吗012---Really? You think this is beautiful?
天啊  难怪我妈恨我012---Oh, my God! No wonder my mother hates me!

我帮你买了礼物012---I brought you back a present.
你用不着这么客气012---Come, on. You didn't have to...
盐水太纪糖012---Saltwater taffy?!
谢谢012---Thanks.
有意思的是012---You know, it's interesting,
多数人以为里面添加了海水012---most people think this is made with seawater.
但事实上它是用加盐淡水做的012---But it's actually made with salted fresh water.
这一点意思都没有012---That's not interesting.
我觉得很有意思啊  我也是  我想你012--- I think it's interesting.  I do too. I missed you!
我也是012---Me too.
这星期你过得如何  非常好012--- So how was your week?  Good.
宝宝开始会动了  太棒了012--- Actually, the baby started kicking.  How exciting!
太神奇了  只可惜012---Yeah. it was amazing. The only thing sad is,
第一次我并不在场012---I wasn't around when it happened for the first time.
不是吧  我还错过了不少别的事情012--- Oh, no.  Yeah. I was missing out on all this other stuff too.
所以乔伊建议瑞秋搬过来跟我住012---So Joey suggested Rachel move in with me.
想得美012---Yeah, right.
怎么了  乔伊害我笑得肚子痛012--- What?  Joey cracks me up.
"让你前妻搬去跟你住吧012---It's like, "Yeah, why don't you have your exwife move in with you?
那一点也不别扭"012---That wouldn't be awkward at all."
想像一下  我才离开了几天012---Can you imagine, I go away for a few days...
回来时却发现男友012---I come back and my boyfriend
跟怀了他孩子的女人同居了012---is living with some woman he got pregnant.
你怎么跟他说的012---So, what'd you tell him?
你怎么会没告诉蒙娜瑞秋搬过去了012---How could you not tell Mona that Rachel is living with you?
她似乎觉得这个想法很不可思议012---I don't know. She seemed to think it was such a crazy idea.
而且她送了我太纪糖012---Plus, she got me taffy.
真的吗  我从没吃过  从没吃过012--- Taffy? Really? I've never had any.  Ever?
我妈忙着计划自杀  没空买盐水零食给我012---My mom was too busy planning her suicide to provide saltwater treats.
谢谢012---Thank you.
你打算一直瞒着她吗012---So what, you're just never going to tell her?
不  我会说的  但得先哄哄她012---No, no, no. I will. I just want to butter her up first.
我要带她去吃一顿丰盛的情人节晚餐012---I'm going to take her to an amazing Valentine's dinner,
做一些浪漫的事012---do all this romantic stuff.
当她觉得我是有史以来最棒的男朋友时012---And then just when she thinks I'm the best boyfriend in the world,
我会告诉她  我怀孕的前女友跟我同居了012---then I'm gonna tell her my pregnant exgirlfriend is living with me.
或许我之前没提过  她是个非常幸运的女人012---If I haven't said it before, she's a lucky, lucky lady.
我们...这个玩意是怎么回事012---So where are...? What the mother of crap is up with this stuff?
到底是口香糖还是食物  能不能咽下去012---God, is it gum? Is it food? What's the deal?
好好吃  我能尝尝粉红色的吗012---Oh, it's nice. May I try a pink one?
她跟我是朋友012---So between her and me being friends,
还跟罗斯交往过...012---and her history with Ross...
这种事绝不能发生012---...it just isn't gonna happen.
那就像是你爱上了一只猫012---It'd be like you falling in love with a cat.
哥们  我最喜欢的狗怎么样了012---Buddy, how's my favorite dog, huh?
我最喜欢的狗怎么样了012---How's my favorite dog?
你好压抑012---You're subdued.
你给它喝啤酒了吗  没有012--- Did you give him a beer?  No.
请回避一下  我们需要谈谈012---Will you excuse us? We need to talk for a moment.
没问题012---Yeah, sure.
是我  好吧012---Oh, me, right.
它很难过  怎么回事  没事012--- He's miserable. What happened to him?  Nothing.
我们不过是聊了些事情  什么事012--- We just talked about stuff.  What stuff?
关于瑞秋的事012---Rachel stuff.
乔伊  你害得它都抑郁了012---Oh, Joey, you bummed him out!
这可是世上最开心乐观的狗012---This is the happiest dog in the world.
它才陪了你半天  瞧它现在012---And he spends half a day with you, and look at him!
它还在喘气012---He's breathing.
我要把它送回温蒂家012---Okay, I'm going to take him back to Wendy's.
别啊  它好着呢  你看012---No, no, no. He's fine. Look, look, look.
快接球012---Here's your ball! Get your ball!
去接球  去接球012---Get your ball! Get your ball! Get your ball!
去...012---Get...
天啊  我对你做了什么012---God, what have I done to you?
我害了这只狗  菲比  我把它整崩溃了012---I broke the dog, Pheebs! I broke the dog!
我要去接蒙娜  今晚你要做什么012---I'm going to pick up Mona. What have you got going tonight?
我有个很棒的情人节计划012---Oh, I got big Valentine's plans.
我订了中国菜012---I got my Chinese food on the way,
还有盐水太纪糖可以吃012---and the rest of your saltwater taffy.
有意思的是  多数人以为里面添加了海水012---It's interesting! Most people think that's made with seawater,
但事实上...  罗斯012--- when in fact...  Ross,
我们是一起看的那部纪录片012---we actually watched the documentary together.
我的外卖来了  我去拿钱012---Oh, my Chinese food. I'll get my cash.
蒙娜012---Mona?
你怎么... 嗨012---What are...? Hi!
你怎么自己来了  我应该去接你的012---What are you doing here? I'm supposed to pick you up.
计划有变  我帮你做了特制情人节晚餐012---Change of plans. I made you a special Valentine's dinner.
大惊喜012---Surprise!
蒙娜  嗨  瑞秋012--- Oh! Hey, Mona!  Hi, Rachel.
她在这里做什么012---What's she doing here?
我不知道啊012---I have no idea.
如果你们要找我  我在房里看电视012---I'll be watching TV if anybody needs me.
她到底在这里做什么012---Seriously, what is she doing?
最近  她喜欢待在这里012---Lately she just likes hanging out here.
为什么  我觉得她很寂寞012--- Why?  I think she's lonely.
但今天是情人节012---Okay, but it's Valentine's Day.
我知道  我们能请她离开吗012--- I know.  Can't we ask her to go?
不行  她情绪波动太大了012---Well, no, she's way too emotional.
其实我是说  她神经失常了012---And by emotional, I mean crazy!
别管我  我的外卖来了012---I'm not here. That's just my Chinese food.
天啊  她还把外卖叫到这里来了012---Oh, my god. She has food delivered here?
对  虽说她情绪起伏  但却精力充沛012---Yes, she's emotional, but ballsy.
知道我怎么打算的吗012---You know what I'm going to do?
我要去换上运动服  躺在床上吃饭012---I'm gonna get in my sweats and eat this in bed.
你还以为她会妨碍到我们呢012---And you thought she was gonna be in our way!
你把香槟打开012---So, okay. Why don't you open the champagne,
我马上回来  我有个大惊喜给你012---and I will be right back. I've got a surprise for you.
你还有别的前妻也藏在里面吗012---You got another exwife back there?
请开始喝香槟吧012---Please start drinking.
我只是来拿电话  瑞秋  等一下012--- I'm just gonna grab the phone.  Rachel, wait.
我希望你不要误会012---I hope you don't take this the wrong way.
可你这是在干嘛012---But, what are you doing?
抱歉  你要用电话吗012---Sorry, do you need the phone?
不012---No, no.
罗斯太好心  没办法说出口012---Listen, Ross is too nice to say anything,
但这是他的公寓012---but this is his apartment.
我们需要隐私012---and, we gotta have some boundaries,
你为什么不回你家  给我们留点隐私呢012---so why don't you go back to your place and give us some privacy?
蒙娜  我住在这里012---But, Mona, I live here.
情人节快乐012---Happy Valentine's Day!
这也可以作为分手礼物012---Or, something to remember me by.
这次是多久  九十秒012--- How long has it been this time?  90 seconds.
有进步012---That's better.
九十秒没去想那个场景  已经很久了012---Ninety seconds is a long time not to think about it.
但其实我满脑子全是那些画面012---Except all I did was think about it.
我知道  我也忘不了012---I know. It haunts me.
我之前见识过最不堪入目的事012---Up till now, the worst thing I ever saw,
是我爸跟脱光的男仆把酒言欢012---was my father doing tequila shots off the naked houseboy.
看完这个  我甚至乐意把他们的照片做成屏保012---After this, I would gladly make that my screen saver.
我们得忘了这件事012---We have to get past this.
我们把录像带扔掉  假装不存在012---Why don't we get rid of the tape and pretend it never existed?
这点我能做到  好012--- I could do that.  Okay.
现在我们只要丢掉这张椅子就行012---Okay. Now all we gotta do is get rid of this chair.
谢天谢地  可不是嘛012--- Oh, thank God!  I know.
请进012---Come in!
抱歉破坏了你们的情人节012---Hi. I'm so sorry to barge in on your Valentine, but...
但我实在受不了他们吵来吵去012---I had to get away from the yelling.
蒙娜要跟罗斯分手012---Mona's dumping Ross.
天啊  可怜的罗斯012--- Oh, my God.  Poor Ross.
平时我们得看他穿内裤做瑜伽012---Great, we have to watch him do yoga in his underwear,
结果现在他却把窗帘拉上了012---but for this he closes the drapes.
瑞秋  关于你想看的那卷生产录影带012---Rach, you know that birthing tape you wanted to see?
在我这里012---It's here.
我们得在你看之前警告你012---We should warn you before you watch it.
千万别看012---Don't watch it.
你们看过了  很可怕吗012---You saw it? Is it scary?
讽刺的是  "生"孩子的画面012---Well, let's just say that it's ironic how footage
让人很想去"死"012---of someone being born can make you want to kill yourself.
现在我被吓住了  你们能跟我一起看吗012---Now I'm all freaked out. Come on, will you watch it with me?
不行  但我会把有我体味的毛衣012---No, but I'll leave a sweater that smells like me
放在你旁边012---right next to you.
说真的  你们不能让我一个人看这种东西012---Seriously, you guys, you're not gonna make me watch this alone.
她说得对  当然不行012---She's right. Of course not.
亲爱的  去拿录影带012---Honey, get the tape.
这个动作我想起了录影带里的某一段内容012---This reminds me of a very specific part of the tape.
来吧012---Here we go.
好吧012---Okay.
天啊012---Oh, my.
加油  为什么宝宝要折磨那个女人012--- Come on, come on.  Why is that baby torturing that woman?
为什么这种玩意我要连看三次012---Why have I seen this thing three times?
但还是很美好啊012---It's still beautiful.
好可怕012---It's horrible!
我知道  我为你感到难过  天啊012--- I know, I know! I'm so sorry for you!  Oh, my god.
你们快看   怎么  她屁股爆炸了吗012---You guys! You guys, look!  What? Did her ass explode?
不  宝宝出来了  你们看012---No, the baby's out. Look, look.
看看那些小手指跟小脚趾012---Look at those little fingers and toes.
看看妈妈现在有多高兴012---Look how happy the mom is now.
瑞秋  去你们的012--- Oh, Rach.  Screw you guys!
要生孩子的又不是你们012---You don't have to do it!
怎么了  蒙娜刚刚甩了我012--- What's up?  Mona just dumped me.
天啊  我很遗憾  为什么012---Oh, man, I'm sorry. Why?
从我最近的种种表现来看012---Well, with everything that's been going on lately,
我算不上个称职的男友012---I haven't exactly been the perfect boyfriend.
我没有告诉她  我让瑞秋怀孕了012---I didn't tell her I got Rachel pregnant.
我给了她我家的钥匙  然后换了锁012---I gave her a key to my apartment and then had the locks changed.
关于瑞秋搬到我家的事  我跟她撒了谎012---Then I lied to her about Rachel moving in with me.
其实  我想怪她不早点跟我分手012---In a way, I judge her for not breaking up with me sooner.
这打击太大了012---That really sucks, man.
特别是在情人节  是啊012--- Especially on Valentine's Day.  Yeah.
等一下  你在这里做什么012---Wait a minute. What are you doing here?
乔伊·崔比安尼在情人节却没有约会012---Joey Tribbiani without a date on Valentine's Day?
发生了什么事  遇上感情困扰了吗012---What's going on, huh? Girl trouble?
可以那么说  真的吗012--- Sort of.  Really?
你不必表现得这么高兴012---You don't have to seem so happy about it.
抱歉  或许我能帮忙012---Sorry. Maybe I can help.
不论发生了什么事  我相信我也有相同的经验012---Whatever it is, I am sure it has happened to me.
事实上 我有次在做爱过程中被甩了012---You know, actually, once I got dumped during sex.
到底发生了什么事012---So anyway, what is it?
算了  没什么大不了的012---Forget about it. It's no big deal.
少来了  怎么了  没事012--- Come on, Joey, what is it?  It's nothing.
你连我都不能告诉吗012---Hey, it's me. Why can't you tell me?
好吧  坐下012---Okay. Sit down.
我很喜欢一个女人012---There's this woman that I like a lot.
但我们不可能在一起012---But it can't happen.
她不会是你的姐妹吧012---She's not a Tribbiani?
不是012---No!
她是你的同事吗012---So is she someone from work?
对012---Yes.
她喜欢你吗012---Well, does she like you?
有时候我觉得是的012---Sometimes I think maybe she could.
但这都无济于事  因为我不能追她012---But it doesn't matter, because I can't do anything about it.
为什么012---Why not?
事情很复杂012---It's complicated.
她跟另一个男人交往了很久012---She was with this other guy for a long time.
他也是我的同事012---Someone from work too.
我不能对他做那种事012---And I could never do that to the guy,
因为我们是好朋友012---because we're really good friends.
以前跟她交往过的那个男人012---So this guy she used to go out with,
还爱着她吗012---is he still in love with her?
我想应该不爱了  好吧012--- No, I don't think so.  Okay.
他是好人吗012---Is he a good guy?
对  他最棒了012---Yeah, he's the best.
那就跟他谈谈012---Then talk to him.
他可能不会介意呢  我不知道012--- He might be fine with it.  I don't know.
乔伊  如果你真的喜欢她  这值得一试012---Joey, come on, it's worth finding out, if you really like her.
我真的非常喜欢她012---I do, so much.
我没办法不想她  我睡不着...012---I can't stop thinking about her. I can't sleep...
你知道吗  你得尽力去争取012---Okay, Joey, you know what? You have to go for it.
你多久才会动一次真情012---How often does this happen to you?
你要对自己负责012---You owe it to yourself.
你的温牛奶来了012---Here's your warm milk.
我要回家加点波本酒012---I'm gonna put the bourbon in it at home.
说真的  跟那个男的谈谈  好吗012---Anyway, seriously, just talk to the guy, okay?
告诉我结果012---Let me know how it goes.
是瑞秋012---It's Rachel.
你要生孩子了  你得做好准备012---You're having a baby and you need to be prepared.
你得看完整只录影带  看吧012---You're gonna make yourself watch the whole thing. Just do it!
我来到这个大城市  希望成为大明星012---I came to the big city to become a star.
为了圆梦 我任何事都愿意做012---I'll do anything to make that happen.
任何事012---Anything?
可能一开始讲的是她怎么怀上的012---Maybe it starts with how she gets pregnant.
你刚刚说是瑞秋吗012---I'm sorry, did you just say it's Rachel?
对012---Yes.
你喜欢瑞秋012---You like Rachel?
对  我喜欢瑞秋012---Yes. I like Rachel.
瑞秋012---Rachel?!
对  听着  你知道的012---Yeah. Okay, but look, you know...
你知道我还喜欢谁吗  你012---You know who else I like? You.
这句话我说得不够多  我喜欢你  罗斯012---And it doesn't get said enough. I like you, Ross.
那个"瑞秋"  没什么大不了的012--- "Rachel" Rachel?  It's not a big deal.
没什么大不了的  抱歉  我只是...012---It's not a big deal? I'm sorry, I just...
那你刚刚说的那些话呢012---What about the stuff you said?
你说你没法不去想她012---How you can't stop thinking about her?
你说你睡不着012---How you can't sleep?
我是个演员  你知道吗012---I'm an actor, you know?
我们演员习惯了夸大事实012---As a group, we tend to be overdramatic.
怀着我孩子的瑞秋012---Rachelwho'scarryingmybaby Rachel?
我知道这样很不好  这样是不对的  好吗012---I know it's bad. And I know it's wrong, okay?
但我们不可能在一起啊012---But it's not like anything's ever gonna happen.
那只是我的一时好感  会慢慢变淡的012---These are just feelings. They'll go away.
我得走了012---You know, I gotta go.
别这样  罗斯012---Hey, come on, Ross...
我只是...  我只有一个...  瑞秋012---I just... You know, I just have one... Rachel?!
瑞秋012---Rachel?!
瑞秋012---Rachel?!
《老友记》  第八季  第16集  乔伊告诉了瑞秋012---Friends S08E16 The One Where Joey Tells Rachel
她在踢我012---Okay, she's kicking.
她在你的体内成长012---She's growing inside you.
这一下踢得好用力012---That was a big one.
她是拒绝过我最年轻的女孩012---I think that's the youngest girl ever to reject me.
大家好  嗨012--- You guys!  Hey there.
我来问你们  你们相信有灵魂伴侣吗012---Listen let me ask you. Do you believe in soul mates?
我相信012---Oh, yes, I do.
我认为每个人都有012---I do. I believe that there is one perfect person
失落的另一半012---out there for everyone.
你知道你该怎么找到他吗  停下寻找的步伐012---You know how you find him? You stop looking for him.
所以我已经不去费劲寻找罗素·克洛了012---That's why I stopped looking for Russell Crowe.
他会找到我的012---He'll find me.
你呢012---And you?
不  我相信有些人彼此适合012---No. I believe that certain people are more suited for each other,
我也相信两人可以相爱  但...012---and I believe in falling in love, but...
我不相信存在灵魂伴侣  很好012--- Soul mates? I don't think they exist.  Okay, good.
怎么了  昨晚我遇到了莫妮卡的灵魂伴侣012--- Why?  Well, last night, I met Monica's.
什么  没错012--- What?  Yeah.
跟我约会的那个男人012---I had a date with this guy.
我发誓他是她的另一半012---And I swear to god he's her other half.
别犯傻了  你不觉得会有人012---Come on, don't be crazy. You don't think there's somebody out there
比我更适合莫妮卡吧012---better suited for Monica than me, do you?
他长什么样子012---Well, what's he like?
他很高  棕发  当然012--- He's tall. He has brown hair.  Of course.
一个发色跟我一样的高大男人012---A tall guy with hair similar to mine?
宇宙真的神秘莫测012---Oh, unknowable universe!
他从事跟食物相关的行业012---He works with food.
当然  年纪比较大吗012---Oh, sure. Older?
没错  他是英国人012---Obviously. And he's British.
我正打算要问你  是啊012--- I was just gonna ask!  Yeah.
他非常聪明  成熟  有自信012---And he's so centered, and mature and confident.
真可惜他们彼此不认识012---It's so sad they never had a chance to meet.
还好她老公没听到你说这种话012---Luckily, the guy she settled for can't hear what you're talking about.
抱歉  我可能搞错了012---Oh, I'm so sorry. Maybe I'm wrong.
我会再跟他约会  对他进一步了解012---I'm gonna go out with him again. I'll find out more.
你明明觉得他跟别人是天生一对012---You believe that this guy is destined for someone else
你还要跟他约会012---and you're still gonna date him?
虽说他不是我的灵魂伴侣  但我总得吃饭吧012---He may not be my soul mate, but a girl's gotta eat.
我刚跟乔伊谈过  我想知道你好不好012---I just talked to Joey. I wanted to see you how you were.
我还是不敢相信  乔伊跟瑞秋012---I still can't believe it. Joey and Rachel?
就像是你跟我交往  只不过更奇怪012---It's like you and me going out, only weirder.
我知道你很难过  我也想安慰你...012---I know you're hurting, and I want to be supportive,
但别再说那种话了012---...but don't say that again.
他们要是结婚了怎么办012---Oh, my god. What if they get married?
他可能做我孩子的继父012---He'd be the stepfather of my child.
我觉得你不必担心这种事情012---Honey, I don't think that's something we need to worry about!
他不会把自己的感觉告诉她012---First of all, he'll never tell her how he feels about her.
就算他说了 你也不知道她会有什么反应012---And even if he did, you have no idea how she'd react.
女人从来就不喜欢乔伊  我觉得他还是处男012---Sure, women never like Joey. I think he's a virgin.
他根本就没想过要追瑞秋  真的吗012--- Joey isn't even thinking about going after Rachel.  He's not?
对  他关心的是你对此事的反应012---No, all he's thinking about is how you're taking this.
这件事把他吓坏了012---Listen, it's completely freaking him out.
他甚至想搬到佛蒙特州去012---He's talking about moving to Vermont.
为什么  他想离开这个国家012--- Why?  He says he wants to leave the country.
他觉得你恨他012---He thinks you hate him.
恨他012---Hate him?
不  我不恨他012---No, I don't hate him.
那可是瑞秋  你知道吗012---It's just, it's Rachel. You know?
我无法想像你有多难过...012---I can't even imagine how hard this must be for you...
但我不希望你跟乔伊因此做不成朋友012---...but I don't want you to lose Joey over it.
现在他想知道你是不是还把他当朋友012---Right now, he just needs to know that you're still his friend.
好吧  我会跟他谈012---Okay, I'll talk to him.
你最好快去012---Do it soon.
他刚刚问我怎么把美金换成佛蒙特货币012---He just asked me how to convert his dollars into Vermont money.
钱德勒  莫妮卡  他是唐  你们好012--- Chandler, Monica, this is Don.  Hello.
你好  幸会012---Hello, nice to meet you.
你好吗  灵魂伴侣012--- How are you?  Soul mate.
你们刚才有什么活动012---So, what have you guys been doing?
我们在艾德瑞提卡吃了顿难以下咽的午餐012---Well, we just had a terrible lunch today at Adriatica.
那家餐厅的番茄干是怎么回事012---What's with the sundried tomatoes in that place?
就是  难道现在还是1985年吗012---I know! Is this 1985?
我就是那么说的  菲比  这很奇怪吧012---That's exactly what I said. Phoebe, isn't that strange.
一点都不会012---Not really.
番茄干怎么了012---What's wrong with sundried tomatoes?
洒在烤鸡披萨上012---On a barbecuedchicken pizza?
不是吗012---No?
唐  你还喜欢哪家餐厅012---So, Don. What other restaurants do you like?
奥克塔维欧  27与7012---Octavio. 27and7.
还有亚利山多洛斯012---There's this great little place, Alessandro's.
天啊  我是那里的主厨012---Oh, my God! That's my restaurant, I'm the chef there.
开玩笑吧  你做的菜好吃极了012---You're kidding me! Your food is fantastic!
我要跟你谈谈你的菜单012---I really want to talk about your menu,
我先去买杯咖啡  还有人要喝吗012---once I get some coffees first. Um, anyone want any?
我要喝拿铁012---Oh, I'd like a latte.
如果你要谈我的事012---You know what? If you're gonna talk about me,
我就跟你一起去012---I'm gonna go with you.
你这是要干什么012---What are you doing?
我发誓我不知道你们在这里012---Nothing. I swear to god, I didn't know you guys would be here.
还好你不相信灵魂伴侣  所以012---And the good news is you don't even believe in soul mates, so...
但我相信英俊的陌生人要追我老婆012---I believe in tall, handsome strangers who hit on my wife.
他们不过是聊天而已012---They're just talking, and you know what?
就算我认为他们是灵魂伴侣012---Just because I think they're soul mates
那也不代表会发生什么事012---doesn't mean anything'll happen.
菲比  做得好012---Phoebe? Good work.
他太棒了  我爱他012---He's great. I love him.
别担心  我们会帮你再找个老婆012---Don't worry, we'll find you someone else.
如果你是来打我的  我能理解  这是我活该012---I understand if you came by to hit me. I deserve it.
不  我不想打你012---No, I don't want to hit you.
怎么  你要踢我012---What, then? Kick me?
不012---No.
咬我012---Bite me?
我不想对你怎么样012---I don't want to do anything to you.
我只想告诉你  我没有生你的气012---I just want to tell you that I'm not mad at you...
我当然也不恨你012---...and that I certainly do not hate you.
我只是来告诉你这些012---I just came here to say that.
等一下  罗斯012---Hey, wait, Ross, Ross?
你想进来喝瓶啤酒吗012---You wanna come in for a beer or something?
好吧012---Yeah, sure.
你带啤酒了吗012---You got any beer?
我只有瑞秋留下的香瓜饮料012---All I got is melon stuff that Rachel left.
好吧012---Okay.
罗斯  有件事你得知道012---Look, Ross. You need to understand something, okay?
我...012---I...
我绝不会对瑞秋采取行动  好吧012---I am never gonna act on this Rachel thing, okay?
我不会做出任何会危及你我友谊的事012---I wouldn't do anything to jeopardize my friendship with you.
谢谢012---Thank you.
总之  我只是...012---Anyway, it'll just...
我得花点时间去淡忘012---It'll take me a while to get over her, that's all.
我不确定我该怎么做012---I'm not even sure how to do that,
我以前从没陷入过爱河  所以012---I mean I've never been in love before, so...
什么012---What?
你爱上她了吗012---You're in love with her?
对  我以为你知道  不知道012--- Yeah. I thought you knew that.  No.
听着  如果有帮助的话012---Look, if it helps,
我真的也不希望自己有那种感觉012---I don't want to feel this way, honest.
我只是一直在想012---I just keep thinking,
"我得忘了这件事"  你知道吗012---"I'll get over this," you know?
但我越努力就越忘不了012---But it just keeps getting harder.
我不知道该怎么办012---I don't know what to do, you know?
我该怎么办012---I don't... What do I do?
我觉得你该告诉她你的感觉012---I think you need to tell her how you feel.
你一定是被这饮料冲昏了头012---Okay, that's the green stuff talking.
我是认真的  你得知道她的感觉012---No, I'm serious. You need to find out where she is.
如果她不喜欢你012---Because if she's not where you are,
你就可以放下了012---then you can start to move past this.
但如果...  我不是说她会这么说012---But what if, and I'm not saying she will be...
如果她喜欢你...012---If she is where you are, then...
那我的感受不该妨碍到你们012---...then my feeling weird shouldn't stand in the way.
你确定  对012--- Are you sure?  Yeah.
如果她要跟别的男人在一起...012---Look, if she's gonna end up with somebody else...
说真的  她找不到更好的人选了012---...the truth is, she couldn't find a better guy, so...
谢谢012---Hey, thanks.
你准备什么时候要跟她谈012---So when do you think you're gonna talk to her?
天啊  我得跟她谈012---Oh, my God. I have to tell her.
我还没有想过  我该说什么012---I haven't thought about what I will say. What should I say?
我能体谅你  但不要太过激动了012---I'm understanding, but let's not get carried away.
抱歉012---I'm sorry. Sorry.
我该说什么012---What am I gonna say?
我也觉得超难喝012---Yeah, tell me about it.
我逐渐放弃了红酒进口的问题012---So I've been slowly phasing out the wine importing
现在全力研究奶酪012---and focusing more on the cheese side of things.
你说奶酪吗012---Cheese, you say?
这研究起来可真够臭气熏天的  唐012---That's some pretty smelly work, huh, Don?
对不起  奶酪很臭012--- Excuse me?  Cheese. It's smelly.
你一定也经常臭气四溢012---You must smell a lot of the time too.
不会的  但我觉得奶酪012---Not really. But when it comes to cheese,
越臭越好012---I'm one of the people who thinks the smellier, the better.
我也是  钱德勒就受不了012---Me too! Chandler can't stand it.
他都不让我在家吃蓝纹奶酪012---He won't even allow me to have blue cheese in the house.
那你还嫁给了他012---And you're still married to him?
知道我想干嘛吗012---You know what I'd love to do?
我想去法国  只吃面包跟奶酪012---I would like to go to France and eat nothing but bread and cheese.
甚至连面包都不吃  只要奶酪012---Not even bread. Just cheese.
不  我要面包012---No, I want the bread.
还有油酥饼012---And pastries.
跟小蛋糕012---And pate.
我并不是真的兴奋  只是以前我很胖012---I'm really not high. It's just I used to be fat.
我在罗亚尔谷有栋别墅012---Well if you where ever enter the Loire valley let me know,
你如果去法国可以住在那里012---I've got a great little villa you can stay at.
是用奶酪做的吗012---Is it made of cheese?
不是  不过用奶酪做的房子  简直宛如天堂012---No. A house made of cheese, wouldn't that be incredible?
我明天就想搬进去  少来了012--- I'd move in tomorrow!  Oh, come on!
你听到了吗  对不起012--- Are you listening to this!  I'm so sorry.
我们该怎么办  我不知道012--- What do we do?  I don't know.
他们都想住在奶酪屋里012---They both want to live in a house of cheese.
我不知道你该拿什么去抗争012---I don't know how you fight that.
好吧  我能做到012---Okay, okay. I can do this.
我可以告诉她我的感觉012---I can tell her how I feel.
好吧  挺直腰杆012---Okay, stand up straight.
深呼吸012---Take a couple deep breaths.
表现出自信012---Look confident.
乔伊  怎么了012---Joey? What's up?
我来找你  是想告诉你一件事012---I just came by because I want to talk to you about something.
怎么了012---Okay. What's up?
就在走廊上谈  我们是畜生吗012---Here, in the hall? What are we, animals?
我开会要迟到了  你能快点说吗012---I'm late for a meeting. Could you make it quick?
我是来告诉你...012---I just came by to tell you that...
我今天想跟你一起吃晚餐012---...I want to have dinner with you tonight.
没问题012---Sure. That sounds great!
给我留言  告诉我到哪里找你012---Just leave me a message and tell me where to meet you. Okay?
好吧  这样也不错012---Okay. That's good.
这又给你几小时的时间012---Okay, that give you a couple hours
准备好谈话内容  不错012---to prepare what you're gonna say. Good. Yeah.
你们就不会敲门吗012---Don't you people ever knock?
我想请唐跟菲比过来012---I'd like to have Don and Phoebe over.
不错吧  没问题  你去安排吧012---Wouldn't that be nice?  Sure. Why don't you set it up?
我就坐着看看征婚广告012---I'll just be over here browsing through the personals.
你没事吧  你有点怪怪的012---Are you okay? You're acting weird all afternoon.
没事  算不上心情大好012---Yeah. Fine. Not perfect.
但也很不错了012---But good enough.
天啊  你这是怎么了012---Jeez, what's with you?
抱歉  你刚刚说"奶酪"吗012---I'm sorry, did you say "cheese"?
怎么了012---All right. What's going on?
菲比说你跟唐是灵魂伴侣012---Phoebe thinks you and Don are soul mates.
我不迷信那种事情012---I don't believe in that kind of stuff,
但你们两个一拍即合012---but then you two totally get along.
如果你想跟唐住在奶酪屋里012---So, look, I won't stand in your way if you wanna run off with Don
我可以退出012---and live in a house of cheese.
钱德勒  你不相信灵魂伴侣012---Chandler, you don't believe in soul mates?
对  但我相信"番茄干先生"相信012---No, but I'm sure "tomahtoes" does.
我也不相信灵魂伴侣012---I don't believe in soul mates, either.
你不相信吗  对012--- You don't?  Nope.
我觉得我们并非注定要在一起012---I don't think you and I were destined to end up together.
而是陷入爱河  努力经营我们的感情012---I think that we fell in love and work hard at our relationship.
有时候要加倍努力经营012---Some days we work really hard.
那你不想跟唐住在奶酪屋里吗012---So you don't want to live with Don in a cheese house?
不  我后来又仔细想了一下012---No, I've had second thoughts about that.
你知道打扫起来有多辛苦吗012---Do you realize how hard it'd be to clean?
我爱你  我知道012--- I love you.  I know.
我今晚要带你去吃晚餐012---You know what? I'm gonna take you out to dinner tonight.
那家餐馆的墨西哥辣椒卷012---I found this place that makes the greatest mozzarella sticks
天下无双012---and jalepino poppers.
不吃吗  真的很好吃012---No? Really? They taste so good.
我知道钱德勒只是开玩笑012---And I know Chandler is kidding,
但他每次一摸我的肚子就会这样012---but it happens whenever he touches my stomach.
我真的担心宝宝不喜欢他012---I mean I'm really worried the baby won't like him.
你没事吧  没事012--- Are you okay?  Yeah, sure.
听着  我之所以...012---Look, the reason...
这里很热吗012---Is it hot in here?
我不觉得  不过你可以把毛衣脱掉012---Not for me, but why don't you take off your sweater?
我也想  但这个地方挺上档次012---I would, but this is a nice place...
而我的T恤上印了卡尔文干荷比丝的图案012---...and my Tshirt has a picture of Calvin doing Hobbes.
天啊  真的吗  我能看一下吗012---Oh, my God, really? Can I see it?
当然可以012---Yeah, sure.
我觉得荷比丝可不想那么"干"012---I wouldn't think Hobbes would like that so much.
我们认识多久了012---How long have we known each other?
七  八...012---Seven, eight...
八年了012---Eight years. Wow.
真的很久了  是啊012--- A long time.  Yeah.
但过去几星期以来我...012---But over the past few weeks, I...
好吧  抱歉让你们久等  今天客人真的很多012---Okay! Sorry about the wait, but it is megajammed in here.
今晚的特餐是...012---We have a couple specials tonight...
你能等一下再来吗  好吧012--- Actually could you give us a second?  Sure.
时间到012---Second's up!
你们不是那种能开玩笑的客人012---Not that kind of table.
你要说什么012---So you were saying?
我不确定012---I'm not quite sure.
你问我们认识了多久012---Okay. You asked how long we knew each other,
我说八年012---and I said eight years.
后来服务生走过来  害他损失了一半的小费012---Then the waiter came over and cut his tip in half...
我们就说到这里了012---...and now here we are.
没错012---Yeah. Here we are.
我...012---I...
我想我爱上你了012---I think I'm falling in love with you.
什么012---What?
我爱上你了012---I'm falling in love with you.
你在跟谁说话012---Who are you talking to?
你在开玩笑  这是闹着玩的012---Oh, you're kidding. It's a joke.
真的很好笑012---Funny. It's funny!
我没找到笑点012---I don't get it.
好吧012---Okay.
你...012---Are you...?
怎么会...012---How did...?
什么时候012---When?
那真的重要吗012---Does it really matter?
这里确实好热012---It is hot in here.
我知道这很难接受012---Rach, I know this is a lot.
你什么都不必说012---You don't have to say anything.
你要花多少时间思考都可以012---You take as much time as you need.
好吧  你得说句话012---Okay, you gotta say something.
乔伊  我非常爱你012---Joey, Joey, I love you so much.
但是...  但是012--- But...  But.
乔伊012---Joey?
对  那...012---Right. Hey, that's...
没关系  真的012---That's okay. That's fine.
我早就料到你会这样012---It's pretty much what I was expecting.
那没什么大不了的  好吗012---So it's no big deal, all right?
我觉得我该走了012---I think I'm gonna go.
乔伊  请不要这样离开012---No, Joey. Please don't leave like this.
你不能这样对一个孕妇012---You can't do this to a pregnant woman!
别哭了012---Don't start doing that.
你不能那么做  瑞秋  你都要把我弄哭了012---You can't do that, Rach, because you're gonna make me...
我们一起哭吧012---Oh, there we go!
可以吗  没问题012--- Can I?  Sure.
乔伊  我不想失去...012---Oh, Joey. I don't want to lose...
不会的  好吗  永远不会012---You can't, okay? Ever.
我真的很抱歉  别这样  瑞秋012--- I'm so sorry.  No, no, no, Rach.
请你不要那么说012---Please don't be sorry.
好吧  别感到抱歉012---Okay? Don't be sorry.
我只是在开玩笑012---You know, I was only kidding.
对  这个笑话很搞笑012---Yeah, that was a real good one.
他们是你的客人  对012--- Is this your table?  Yeah.
你得在这里待上一整晚了  我知道012--- God, you'll be here all night.  I know.
我连特餐内容都还没有介绍012---I haven't even read them the specials yet.
他们怎么了012---What's the matter with them?
我不知道  可能他们有人快死了012---I don't know. I think maybe one of them is dying.
我希望是那个女的012---I kind of hope it's the girl.
那个男的真的很帅012---The guy is really cute!
乔伊  你在吗012---Joey? Are you in there?
是瑞秋  乔伊  你得跟她谈一谈012--- That's Rachel.  Joey, you have to talk to her.
不行  经过那晚的事之后012---No. I can't. I can't. Not after the other night.
感觉太奇怪了012---It's too weird, okay?
别告诉她我在这里012---Don't tell her I'm here.
别吃那个012---Don't eat that!
瑞秋  乔伊在吗012--- Hey, Rachel.  Is Joey here?
我没有看到他  你呢  没有012--- I don't see him. Do you see him?  I don't see him.
或许他在糖碗里  乔伊  没人012---Maybe he's in the sugar bowl. Joey? Nope.
至少你们能彼此逗乐012---Well, at least you make each other laugh.
怎么了  自从他那晚跟我坦白之后012--- What's up?  I haven't seen him since that night
我就一直没见过他012---that he told me how he, you know...
我觉得他在躲我012---I don't know, I think he's avoiding me.
为什么地板上会有百吉饼012---Why is that bagel on the floor?
我们在玩游戏  钱德勒脱了衣服玩的吗012--- We were playing a game. Was Chandler naked?
像是套圈圈之类的游戏吗012---Sort of like a ringtoss kind of situation?
没错  什么  不是012--- Sure!  What? No! No!
好吧  如果你们看到乔伊012---All right, listen. If you see Joey,
能不能告诉他...012---will you just tell him that...?
告诉他我很想他012---Tell him I miss him.
好吧  你听到了吗012---Okay. Did you hear that?
是啊  裸体百吉饼游戏012---Yeah. That naked bagel game?
我很怀疑  这个洞很小的012---Dude, I don't know. That's a pretty small hole.
你得跟她谈一谈  我做不到012--- Honey, you've gotta talk to her.  I can't.
你们不知道真情告白之后012---You guys don't know what it's like
却被拒绝的感觉有多难受012---to put yourself out there like that and just get shot down.
我不知道那种感觉012---I don't know what that's like?
我在25岁前一直以为012---Until I was 25, I thought the response
对"我爱你"的回应是"真糟糕"012---to "I love you" was "Oh, crap."
我没有被拒绝过012---No rejection?
我连在减肥营都被拒绝过012---I got shot down at fat camp.
天啊  饿肚子的孩子可真恶毒012---Boy, kids are mean when they're hungry.
我该怎么办012---So, what do I do?
她是瑞秋  难道你永远都不跟她说话了吗012---This Rachel. You're gonna never talk to her again?
那很奇怪  也很尴尬  但至少你得试试看012---I know it's weird and it's awkward, but you gotta at least try.
好吧012---Yeah, okay.
我忘了这个曾套在你的...012---I almost forgot this was on your...
我们根本就没玩012---We didn't play it!
《老友记》  第八季  第17集  茶叶012---Friends S08E17 The One With The Tea Leaves
等你们喝完茶之后012---Okay, so when you're done with your tea,
我可以看茶叶帮你们算命012---I'll look at the leaves and tell your fortune.
你会茶叶算命法吗  我做过好几年了012--- You didn't know read tea leaves?  I've done it for years.
我后来放弃是因为我算得太难了012---I actually stopped because I was so accurate.
生命最大的乐趣之一012---And one of the great joys of life...
就在于其神奇的不可预测性012---...is its wondrous unpredictability, you know?
而且我喝茶会拉肚子012---And also, tea tends to give me the trots.
我喝完了  帮我算吧  好的012--- Okay. I'm done. Read mine.  Okay.
我看到一个梯子012---I see a ladder.
代表的要么是升职  要么是暴力性死亡012---Which can mean either a promotion or a violent death.
我是主厨  不可能再升职了012---I'm the head chef. I can't get promoted.
下一个是谁012---Who's next?
我喝完了  帮我算  好吧012--- Okay. I'm done. Do mine.  Okay.
好吧  我看到一个圈圈012---Oh! Okay, I see a circle.
那表示你要么怀了孩子012---Which can either mean you're having a baby...

虽说你们现在很难相处  但情况会改善的012---I konw, it's tough now, but things will get better.

你不吃的话我绝不罢休  好吧012--- I won't quit until you try one.  Okay, fine, fine.
很棒012---Good.

那是我们第一次约会的地方012---That's where we had our first date.
她走进来012---She walked in
我在房间里铺满了她最喜欢的百合花012---and I had the room filled with lilies, her favorite flower.

音响系统里传出弗莱德·艾斯塔的歌声012---Then Fred Astaire singing, "The Way You Look Tonight"

派克人很好  我想多了解他012---Parker's a nice guy, and I'd like to get to know him.

为什么  因为我要杀了他012--- Why?  Because I'm gonna kill him.

我们摸着良心说话  这个派对烂透了012---Let's call a spade a spade. This party stinks.
就是  我简直无聊到了极点012---I know. I'm having the worst time.
那边取自助餐要排15分钟的队012---There was a 15minute line for the buffet,

结果踩到一大坨鼻涕滑倒了012---...I slipped on a giant booger.
你确定那不是生蚝吗012---Are you sure it wasn't an oyster?

我把它抹在钱德勒的外套上  拔腿就溜012---I just wiped it on Chandler's coat and got the hell out.
我还以为他是个好人  我对他真的很期待012---I thought he was a great guy. I was so excited about him.
嘿  你应该对他充满期待012---Well, hey, you should be excited about him.
他没有什么不对  他是个好人012---There's nothing wrong with him. He's a good guy.
真的吗  对  你知道吗012--- You think?  Yeah, you know what I think?
我们都太悲观了  你说得对012--- I think we were all just being too negative.  You're right.
他只是在拥抱生命而已012---You're right. He's just embracing life.
我们都应该向派克学习012---We could all stand to be a little more like Parker.
你知道吗  我就跟他一样012---You know what? I'm like him!
我是个积极乐观的人012---I'm a sunny, positive person!
事实上  你现在稍微有点激动了012---Actually, you have a little bit of an edge.
你小子说什么012---What's that now?
是派克  看  兔子舞012--- Oh, it's Parker!  Look, the Bunny Hop!

跟着音乐学动物跳舞  来吧012---People acting like animals to music? Come on!

我知道往年一向都是由罗斯来致词012---I know that normally Ross gives the toast,
但今年由我来012---but this year I'm gonna do it.
别这样  内容会很精彩012---No, it's gonna be great. Really.
好的012---Okay.
妈  爸  我结婚时012---Mom, Dad, when I got married...
令我对婚姻充满信心的原因之一012---...one of the things that made me sure that I could do it
就是你们这对模范夫妻为我做出的表率012---was the amazing example the two of you set for me.
为了那一点及其他种种  我要感谢你们012---For that, and for so many other things, I want to thank you.
这句话我或许不常说  但...012---I know I probably don't say it enough, but...

我环顾四周012---When I look around this room,
想起那些无法出席的人  便心生悲伤012---I'm saddened by the thought of those who could not be with us.
我亲爱的外婆012---Nana, my beloved grandmother,
她肯定很想来012---who would so want to be here.
但她来不了...012---But she can't...
因为她死了012---...because she's dead.
我们的狗琪琪也是一样012---As is our dog, ChiChi.
你们看它多可爱... 那是以前的事了012---I mean, look how cute she is... was.
帮我个忙  请把这个传给我爸妈012---Do me a favor, pass this to my parents.

很有意思吧  杰克012---Wasn't it interesting, Jack?
为什么我不记得这只狗了012---Why don't I remember this dog?
罗斯  你为什么不为我们致词呢012---Ross? Why don't you give us your toast now?
不  妈  今年只有莫妮卡致辞012---Oh, no, Mom. It's just Monica this year.

你都不打算不致词吗012---On our 35th wedding anniversary?
当然不是012---No, of course.

那只是刹车灯而已  派克012---They were just brake lights, Parker!
对不起我把塞车形容得如此美好012---Excuse me for putting a good spin on a traffic jam.
你不必对所有事物都做美化012---You don't have to put a good spin on everything!

这是我们的私下谈话  你不是...012---Now, off the record, you're not...
怎么  你是在说我的男士背包吗012---What? Are you referring to my man's bag?
刚开始我只觉得它好看  但它还很实用012---At first, I thought it just looked good, but it's practical, too.
快看啊  里面有很多放东西的小袋子012---Check it out. It's got compartments for stuff:

化妆品012---Your makeup.
我是要从你的正面滑下去  让我们面对面012---No, no, no. Should I climb down your front so we're face to face
还是从你的背面滑下去012---or should I climb down your back
屁股对着脸012---so we're butt to face?
我想面对面比较好  对  面对面012--- I think face to face. Face to face, yeah.  I would say that.
好吧  我来了  好吧012--- Okay, here I come.  All right.
天啊...你有多重  罗斯012---Oh, my... How much do you weigh, Ross?
我现在不想回答那个问题012---I prefer not to answer that right now.
假日结束后  我胖了不少012---I'm still carrying a little holiday weight.
我们说"面对面"的时候012---You know when we talked about "face to face,"
没有完全想清楚012---we didn't think it all the way through!
菲比012---Hey, Pheebs.
你看012---Check it out.
我很有男子气概吧012---How much of a man am I?
不错嘛  男子气概中透着淫荡012---Nice. Manly and also kind of a slut.
你变成女人了012---You're turning into a woman.
才没有  你为什么会那么说  那太伤人了012---No, I'm not! Why would you say that? That's just mean!
我惹毛你了吗  我说了什么012---Now I've upset you? What did I say?
不是你说的话  而是你的语气012---Not what you said, it's just the way you said it.
天啊  我是个女人012---Oh, my God! I'm a woman!
我睡得很香  没错012--- Great nap.  It really was.
我  男同志  不是012---Me? Gay? No. No. No.
但我有很多密友是男同志012---But I have a number of close friends who are.

我相信女性读者对你的爱情生活012---I'm sure our female readers will be interested
很有兴趣012---to know about your romantic life.
我会对着一个女人上下打量  对她说012---What I do is, I look a woman up and down and I say:
"嘿  你好吗"012---"Hey. How you doing?"
拜托012---Oh, please.
嘿  你好吗012---Hey. How you doing?
嘿  你好吗012---Hey. How you doing?
他有一辆很棒的保时捷012---He has an amazing Porsche under there.

你是个好人012---You're a really nice guy.
我很愿意当你的室友跟朋友012---I'm happy to be your roommate and your friend.
我只是对你没有那种感觉012---I'm just... You know, I just don't feel that way about you.
我知道是怎么回事了012---I see what happened.
那是因为我试着抗拒你  对吧012---It's because I was trying to repel you. Right?
相信我  我发动攻势后012---Believe me, you'd feel a lot different
你会有截然不同的感觉012---if I turned it on.
我觉得不会  绝对会012--- I don't think so.  Oh, I do.
你好吗012---How you doing?
我很好012---I'm okay.
什么  天啊012---What? Oh, dear God!
没什么好说的  我真的很害羞012---Not much to tell there. I'm really shy.
好了  我猜我已经问完了012---So that's it. I guess that's all I need.
非常感谢012---Thank you so much.
我想应该下一期就会刊出你的访问012---I think they will be running this in the beginning of next month.
太棒了  谢谢你012---Oh, great. Great. Thank you.
再见  拜拜012--- Bye.  Byebye.
我办到了  太棒了012--- I did it.  Amazing.
等一下  我差点忘了012---Wait, I almost forgot.
我们对每个人都要提这个问题012---We have to ask everybody this:
除了《我们的日子》以外你最喜欢哪出肥皂剧012---Other than Days, what's your favorite soap opera?
我不看肥皂剧  抱歉012---Oh, I don't watch soap operas. Excuse me?
我的生活没那么无聊012---I have a life, you know?
谢谢  《肥皂剧文摘》的读者012---Thank you. The readers at Soap Opera Digest
知道那点一定会很高兴012---will be happy to learn that.
非常好012---Good enough.
只差一点而己012---So close.
他们竟然没登出你012---I can't believe they didn't put in the part
说你不看肥皂剧那一段012---where you said you didn't watching soaps.
我打电话告诉那个女记者  我是在开玩笑012---Yeah, I called the lady about that. I told her I was just joking.
她接受了012---She was nice about it.
你跟她上床了  对吧  可以那么说012--- You slept with her, didn't you?  A little bit.
你的这张照片英气逼人啊012---This picture of you is steamy.
那是为了配合我男同志影迷的喜好012---That's just a little something for my huge gay fan base.
你在对我抛媚眼吗012---Did you just wink at me?
是你说喜欢那张照片的012---You're the one who loves the picture.
有多少人会来参加宝宝的欢迎会012---So, what's the final head count on my baby shower?
大约有20个人  有些同事有事没空过来012---About twenty. Couple people from work had something else to do.
你的妹妹们打电话来说她们没办法来012---Also both of your sisters called and neither can make it.
什么  她们竟然不来参加012---What? You mean they're not coming to a social event
没有男人跟酒精的社交聚会012---where there's no men and no booze?
那真的是太稀奇了012---That's shocking.
我不在乎  只要我妈能来就行了012---I don't care, as long as my mom's here.
天啊  你妈012---Oh, my God. Your mother.
怎么  我妈不会来吗012---What? My mom's not gonna be here?
由于我们忘了邀请她012---Well, given that we forgot to invite her,
她要是能来那还真是天大的巧合呢012---it would be a big coincidence if she was.
我的天啊012---My God!
不是我的错  负责邀请来宾的是菲比012---It wasn't my fault, Phoebe was in charge of the invitations.
我没有妈妈  所以我常忘了012---I don't have a mother. So often I forget...
少来了你012---Oh, give it a rest.
所以说我妈不来参加宝宝的欢迎会吗012---So my mother is not coming to my baby shower?
对012---No.
我妈也不会来012---Neither is mine.
你别着急012---You know what? Don't worry.
我们会处理的  我们会打电话给她012---We'll take care of it. We'll call her.
你先回家做准备012---You go home and get ready.
确定她一定会来  这对我很重要  她是我妈012---Please, make sure she comes. It's really important to me. It's my mom.
我知道  她电话号码是多少  我不知道012--- I know. What's her number?  I don't know.
你去吧  我记在我的电话簿里了012---Go. I have it in my book. Go.
等等  如果你负责邀请来宾012---Wait a minute. If you're in charge of invitations,
那为什么是我打电话给她012---why am I the one who has to call her?
喂  格林太太  我是莫妮卡·盖勒012---Hello, Mrs. Green! Hi, it's Monica Geller.
哈喽  莫妮卡  嗨012--- Oh, hello, Monica.  Hi.
我知道时间紧促012---I know this is lastminute,
我们打算在今天临时012---but we've decided to throw an impromptu...
帮瑞秋的宝宝办欢迎会012---...baby shower for Rachel today.
我的女儿们已经告诉我了012---I know, my daughter's told me about it
她们一个月前就接到欢迎会的"临时"请帖了012---when they received their impromptu invitations a month ago.
好吧  我很抱歉012---Okay, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
为什么呢  亲爱的012---For what, dear?
为了没有邀请我  还是说谎骗我呢012---For not inviting me, or for lying about it?
天啊  我的屁股在流汗012---Oh, my God! My ass is sweating.
拜托了  您能来吗  四点开始012---Please, please, can you come? It starts at 4:00.
好吧  四点见  谢谢012--- Well, all right. I'll see you at 4.  Thank you.

你请脱衣舞男来宝宝欢迎会012---You ordered a stripper for the shower?
那太不合适了012---That is totally inappropriate.
怎么了  他会打扮成宝宝的样子012---Why? He's gonna be dressed as a baby.

我不建议让管家兼职012---Now I don't want you to use your housekeeper
因为那样她会分心的012---'cause it would just split her focus.
事实上  我不打算请奶妈012---Actually, I'm not gonna use a nanny.
我也没有管家012---And I don't have a housekeeper.
你简直像是山顶洞人012---It's like you're a cave person.
瑞秋  你得请个奶妈012---Rachel, you must get a nanny.
你不知道带孩子有多累012---You don't know how overwhelming this is gonna be.
你小时候我雇用了凯太太012---I mean when you were a baby I had full time help, I had Mrs. Kay.

我要再回答一题012---I'll take another question.
好吧  这题很难  屏住呼吸012---Okay. This is gonna be tough. Hold your breath.
没关系  我准备好了012---It's okay. I'm ready.
不  哥们  在你回答问题之前012---No dude, you gotta hold your breath
要一直屏住呼吸012---until you're ready to answer the question.
这是游戏规则012---This is part of the game.
这太可笑了  他没法屏住...012---This is ridiculous! He's not gonna hold his...
好吧  如果你患有这种恐惧症012---Okay. What do you have a fear of
那你害怕的是什么  恐...012---if you suffer from this phobia? Triska...
天啊  那个词真长  恐...012---Holy cow. That's a big word. Trisk...
看看这个词  钱德勒  这该怎么念012---Seriously, look at this. Chandler, how do you say that?
让我看看  就是这个词012--- Let me see that.  This one right here.
恐十三症  害怕薄脆饼干012--- Triskaidekaphobia.  Fear of Triscuits!
不  是害怕数字十三  害怕薄脆饼干012--- No! No. Fear of the number 13.  Fear of Triscuits?
这有可能  饼干的边缘很锋利的012---It's possible. They have really sharp edges.
钱德勒  轮到你了012---Alright, Chandler, you're up.
等等  我可以用天使通行证换一次答题机会012---Wait a minute. I'm entitled to use my Angel Pass for a free turn.
这个游戏真的很没有道理012---This game makes no sense!
你生气是因为你要输了012---You're upset because you're losing.
少来了  罗斯  我觉得我们都是失败者012---Oh, come on, Ross. I think we're all losers here.
好  钱德勒012---Alright, Chandler.
你可以选旋转轮子或挑一张搜索卡012---You can either spin the Wheel or pick a Google Card.

我不在乎012---Oh, I don't care.
你非选不可  宾先生012---You must choose, Mr. Bing.

你拿到了罗斯所有的分数  什么012--- You get all of Ross' points!  What?
这个游戏开始好玩起来了012---This game is kind of fun!
你不觉得你拿到我的分数太疯狂了...012---You don't think it's a little crazy that you get all my points...
参赛者不该相互交谈的012---I don't think the contestants aren't supposed to speak to each other.
你为什么要邀请我妈来  什么012--- Why did you invite my mother?  What?
她要搬过来跟我和罗斯住012---She wants to move in with me and Ross
以便帮忙照顾宝宝012---to help take care of the baby.
多久  八星期012--- For how long?  Eight weeks.
我爱我妈012---I love my mother,
但是跟她一起吃长午餐就是种折磨012---but, my God, a long lunch with her is taxing.
如果她想跟我住  我会觉得很荣幸012---I personally would be honored if she wanted to live with me.
她又听不到你拍马屁012---She can't hear you.
我该怎么样012---What am I gonna do?
如果不希望她搬过去  你该直说012---If you don't want your mother to move in with you, just tell her.
你说得对  我就快生了012---You're right. You're right. I'm about to have a baby.
我可以说我不希望她012---I can tell my mother that I don't want her
睡在我家沙发上012---to just be sleeping on my couch!
她会睡在我床上 绝不能让那种事发生012---She'll wanna sleep in my bed with me. This can't happen.
没错012---That's right. That is right.
你去告诉她012---You go over there and tell her
你不希望她搬过去跟你们住012---you don't want her to live with you.
一定要坚持立场  好012--- Do not take no for an answer.  Okay.
这简直太棒了  现在她会生瑞秋的气012---This is great! Now she's gonna be mad at Rachel!
我要趁虚而入012---And I'm just gonna swoop in there
当她的乖女儿讨好她012---and be like the daughter she never had.
我对钱德勒又产生了新的敬意012---I have new respect for Chandler.
好了  大伙们  该来拆礼物了012---All right, everybody! It's time to open the presents!
对  瑞秋要拆的第一样礼物...012---Yes! I think the first gift that Rachel opens...
应该是外婆送的礼物012---...should be from the grandmother of the baby.
因为你是这里最重要的人012---Because you're the most important person in this room!
也是全世界最重要的人012---And in the world!
我没有准备礼物012---I don't have a gift
因为我直到最后时刻才受到邀请012---because I wasn't invited until the last minute.
但非常谢谢你  亲爱的012---But thank you so much, dear,
让大家都注意到这一点012---for bringing that to everybody's attention.
你们这些不太重要的人呢012---How about you less important people?
我们来拆你们的礼物吧012---Let's open your presents!
你没准备礼物也没关系012---It's okay that you didn't get me a gift.
但我也算是送了你一样礼物012---I kind of did.
我要跟你同住八个星期012---Me! Eight weeks of me.
好吧  妈  事实上我可以自己照顾宝宝012---Okay. See, Mom, the truth is, I can do this on my own.
宝贝  我知道你会是个好妈妈012---Sweet heart, I know you're gonna be a terrific mom.
但我觉得一开始你还是需要有人帮忙012---I just think you need a little help, especially at the beginning.
我知道自己在做什么  我应付得来012---But mom, I really know what I'm doing. I can handle this.
真的吗  还记得亮亮吗012---Really? Remember Twinkles?
他是只仓鼠  我又不会拿吸尘器吸我的宝宝012---He was a hamster. I'm not gonna vacuum up my baby!
快来吧  瑞秋  拆礼物的时间到了012---Okay, come on, Rach. It's present time!
你是这个派对的主角012---You're the glue holding this party together.
现在这个派对也快毁了012---It's kind of falling apart here.
你看  哇012--- Oh, look!  Wow!
这是你同事送的012---This is from your friends at work.
天啊  哇012---Oh, my gosh! Oh, wow!
我知道这是什么012---Oh, I know what this is.
等一下012---Wait a minute.
不可能啊012---That can't be right.
这是宝宝啤酒机吗012---Is that a beer bong for a baby?
女儿  那是挤奶器012---Darling, that's a breast pump.
我说过我猜完了吗012---Did I say I was done guessing?
好吧  谢谢012---Okay, thank you for that.

我了解  你手下会有30个人012--- I see.  But there'll be 30 people under you...
你可以把很多工作分配给他们012---...so you can dump a certain amount on them.
那太好了  我们可以进一步详谈012--- Good to know.  We could go into detail...

放轻松  你表现得很好012---You can relax. You did great.
谢谢  我刚才真的很紧张012---Yeah, I gotta say thank you, I was really nervous.
大家都说我太喜欢讲笑话缓和气氛012---I'm told I come on too strongly, too many jokes.
要避开"职责"的问题真的很难012---And then it was really hard to sidestep that "duty" thing.

我不希望你跟她约会012---I don't want you to date her.
为什么  你在吃醋吗012---Why? What, are you jealous?
对  但不是因为我想你跟我交住012---Yes. And not because I want you to go out with me.
而是因为我不希望你跟任何人交住012---Because I don't want you to go out with anybody.
我知道不该去想这种事情012---I know it's a terrible thing to even think this
我也知道这样很不合适012---and it's completely inappropriate...
但我希望你全天24小时都能随时012---but I want you to be at my constant beck and call,
听从我的差遣012---24 hours a day.
我非常抱歉  但这就是我的真实感觉012---I'm very sorry, but that is just the way that I feel.
好吧  什么012--- Okay.  What?
我不约会  我会012---I won't date. I'll...
我会一直陪着你012---I'll be here with you all the time.
真的吗012---Really?
但我的要求很无理012---But I'm being so unreasonable.
没错  但你有资格无理取闹012---True, but you're allowed to be unreasonable.
你怀了我们的宝宝012---You're having our baby.
罗斯  谢谢你012---Oh, Ross, thank you. Thank you.
你感觉好点了吗012---You feel better?

瑞秋  我只是在开你玩笑012---Oh, Rach, I was just messing around.
就像昨晚我要尿尿你逗我那样012---Like you did last night when I had to pee?
我就知道012---Oh! I knew that.
我就知道  我也是在开你玩笑012---I knew that! I was just messing with you too!
好吧  因为你看起来似乎...012---Okay. Because for a minute you seemed...
不  那是...  但你像是真的...012--- No, it's just... ...like you actually...
那只是因为我很会开玩笑012---That's just because I'm such a good messer!

亲爱的  或许你坐在这里会比较舒服012---Sweetie, maybe you'd be more comfortable here.
你012---You.
你对我做的孽还不够多吗012---Like you haven't done enough.
我知道你现在很痛苦012---I know how miserable you are.
我真的希望能帮上忙012---I wish there was something I could do.
我希望自己是海马012---I wish I were a sea horse.
因为是公海马负责孵育小宝宝012---Because with sea horses, it's the male. They carry the babies.
而且我还会生活在海里  离你远远的012---And then also, I'd be far away in the sea.
天啊012---God.
我这辈子从来没有这么难受过012---I have never been so uncomfortable in my entire life.
我了解  我也有过这种经历  我记得最后012---I know. I've been there. I remember toward the end...
菲比  你的故事很精彩012---Phoebe, that's a great story.
能不能帮我拿杯冰茶来再说012---Can you tell it to me when you're getting me some iced tea?
天啊  滚出来  滚出来  滚出来012---Oh, God, get out! Get out, get out, get out!
咱们滚吧012---Let's.
你生完宝宝了吗012---Hey, did you have the baby yet?
你想让我过去坐在你身上吗012---Do you want me to come over there and sit on you?
我真做得出来012---Because I'll do it.
你怎么这么早就回来了012---What are you doing here so early?
公司要我回家012---They sent me home from work.
他们让我从现在就开始休产假  回家休息012---They said, "Start your maternity leave now. Just rest."
为宝宝出生做好准备  去他们的012---Get ready for the baby. You know what? Screw them!
如果他们不要我待在公司012---If they don't want me there,
我就跟你们待在一起012---I'll hang out with you guys.
或许你可以去做义工012---Or you could do volunteer work.
喂  乔伊  我是艾丝特尔012--- Hello?  Joey, it's Estelle.
好消息  我帮搞你到了首映会的门票012---Great news. I was able to get you
你可以带一位朋友出席012---and one guest tickets to your premiere.
一位朋友  你之前说我可以拿到六张票012---One guess? You told me I could have six tickets.
我把其中四张拿去易趣网拍卖了012---Well, I sold four of them on eBay.
你会坐在"帅哥372"旁边012---You'll be sitting next to HotGuy372.
天啊  难道我就只能带一个朋友去吗012---Oh, my god. So that's it? I only get to bring one guest?
对  你什么时候来接我012---Yeah. What time you wanna pick me up?
喂012---Hello?
你们听到了吗012---You hear that?
我只能带一个朋友参加首映会012---I only get one extra ticket to my premiere.
所以我得在你们三个跟罗斯之间做选择012---So somehow I have to pick between you three and Ross.
我呢  你说过你不想去012--- What about me?  You said you didn't want to go.
没错  但我还是希望有被重视的感觉012---I don't. But I would still like to be acknowledged.
难道我怀孕了就变成隐形人了吗012---Because I'm pregnant, I'm invisible?
你绝不是隐形人012---Definitely not invisible.
罗斯根本不在这里  所以他出局了012---Ross didn't care enough to be here, so I think he's out.
你打磕睡  你就输了012---You snooze, you lose.
他没有打磕睡  他在教书012---He's not snoozing. He's teaching a class.
那么一定有人在打磕睡012---Well, then somebody's snoozing.
乔伊  不要因为我的话影响你的选择012---And, Joey, not that this should affect you at all,
但如果你选了我...012---but if you pick me...
我打算穿露到这里的紧身连衣裙012---...I was planning on wearing a sequin dress cut down to here.
我还没有看过这套连衣裙012---I haven't seen this dress.
穿上绝对有影星风范012---Star in a movie.
乔伊  你想挑谁都可以012---Joey, you pick whoever you want.
听从你内心的声音012---Listen to your heart.
它跟你说了什么012---What does it tell you?
菲比  菲比  菲比...012---Phoebe. Phoebe. Phoebe.
这个嘛...012---Well...
我想我要挑钱德勒012---I think I want to take Chandler.
菲比  菲比  菲比...012---Phoebe, Phoebe, Phoebe.
你想带我去吗012---You want to take me?
对  我希望能带大家一起去012---Yeah, I'm sorry. I wish I could take everybody.
但钱德勒一直都很支持我的工作012---But Chandler's always supported my career.
他帮我付表演课跟大头照等等的费用012---He's paid for acting classes, headshots and stuff.
这就是我回报你的方式012---This will be my way of paying you back.
所以你不打算还我钱了吗012---So you're never actually going to pay me back?
只因为他帮你付大头照的钱  你就要选他012---Just because he paid for your headshots, you're gonna take him?
你大概还没搞明白那件连衣裙有多露012---I don't think you're comprehending just how slutty this dress is.
不仅是因为他帮我付了钱012---It's not just the stuff he paid for.
他真的很支持我  你们知道吗012---It's everything, you know?
他跟我对台词012---He read lines with me.
我紧张的时候  他陪我去试镜012---He went with me on auditions when I was nervous.
我没拿到我想要的角色时  他会安慰我012---Then he consoled me after I didn't get parts that I really wanted.
你一直很相信我012---You always believed in me, man,
即使连我都不相信自己012---even when I didn't believe in myself.
我一直都知道你会成功012---I always knew you were gonna make it.
我非常以你为荣012---I'm so proud of you.
谢谢  那对我来说很重要012---Thanks, that means a lot to me.
莫妮卡  或许他们之中有人想穿你的连衣裙012---Mon, maybe one of these guys wants to wear your dress.
我得去刮胡子012---I'm gonna go shave.
对  我得去吐痰了012---Yeah, well, I'm gonna go spit.
我得去尿尿了012---I have to pee.
如果五分钟后我还没出来012---If I don't come out in five minutes,
那肯定是因为我被百花香味给熏死了012---it's because I've choked to death on the potpourri stink.
等她出来以后  你捏住她的鼻子012---When she comes out, you hold her nose,
我对她的嘴巴吹气  宝宝就会掉出来012---I'll blow in her mouth and the kid'll just... right out of her.
她都晚了一周了  今天她一定会生012---She's over a week late. She's got to have it today, right?
我不知道  我觉得应该还要一阵子012---I don't know. I think it's still gonna be a while.
你想加点刺激吗012---Care to make it interesting?
我跟你打赌  她明天这个时候就会生012---I bet you she'll have it by this time tomorrow.
没问题012---You're on.
好吧  赌多少  我跟你赌十万块012--- Okay, how much?  One hundred thousand dollars.
50块如何012---How about 50 bucks?
好吧  我会打电话让苏黎世银行汇点钱过来012---Fine, I'll call Zurich and move some money around.
好了  这次轮到谁来扶我起来了012---All right, whose turn is it to help me get up?
家里没人012---No one's here.
该死012---Oh, damn it!
这简直是太刺激  太迷人了012---This is so exciting. So glamorous!
好多人帮我们拍照  我看起来如何012---People taking our picture. How do I look?
太高了一点  什么012--- A little tall.  What?
你能不能蹲低一点  让我看起来高一点012---Would you crouch down a bit so that I look taller?
很好012---There you go.
简直太刺激了012---It's just so glamorous.
莫妮卡  瑞秋来了012---Oh, hey, Mon? Rach is here.
你还没生012---And you're still pregnant.
真对不起  我知道你很不舒服012---I'm sorry. I know how uncomfortable you are.
你知道吗  你看起来棒极了012---You know what? You look great.
就跟50块钞票一样012---Yeah, like 50 bucks.
我得去尿尿012---I have to go pee.
很明显  这个宝宝把我的膀腕当成玩具捏012---Apparently this baby thinks my bladder is a squeeze toy.
该死  50块拿去012---Damn it. Here's your 50 bucks.
你竟然会输  这真是太有趣了012---That's interesting that you lost.
我记不得了  你喜欢输吗012---Now, I forget, do you like to lose?
好吧  别说了012---All right, stop it.
我们加倍赌她明天会生  好  跟你赌012--- Double or nothing she has it by tomorrow.  Fine, you're on.
在那之前  葛兰特将军012---Until then, General Grant,
你就在这里安心扎营吧012---why don't you set up camp... right there?
瑞秋在这里吗  我们得去看医生012---Is Rachel here? We have a doctor's appointment.
她在厕所里012---She's in the bathroom.
瑞秋  我们得走了  马上好012--- Rach, we gotta go.  In a minute!
大家问我们为什么没在一起012---People ask me why we're not together.
我都不知道该怎么告诉他们012---I just don't know what to tell them.
好吧  我们走吧012---All right, all right, let's go.
你要不要先去换衣服012---Do you want to go change first?
医生会等我们  但如果你快一点的话...012---The doctor's staying open late for us, but if you hurry...
不用  我这样很好012---No, I'm fine.
你不觉穿这套衣服有点不合适吗012---You don't think that's a little inappropriate?
什么  天啊  别火上浇油了012--- What?  Good God, man. Don't anger it.
罗斯  现在外面有38度高温012---Ross, it is 100 degrees outside.
这是好几个星期以来我第一次...012---For the first time in weeks, I am...
好吧  随便你012---Fine. Whatever you want.
你是妈咪012---You're the mommy.
可别叫我"妈眯"012---No! Don't call me "Mommy."
你那么称呼你妈就已经够受了012---It's bad enough you call your own mother that.
这一次我同意她的说法012---I'm actually with her on this one.
我还以为自己知道敌人是谁  但敌人却是你012---I thought I knew who the enemy was, but it was you all along.
好了  我的打斗戏要开始了012---Okay, this is it. This is my big fight scene coming up.
我要为第82地面师的每位弟兄奋战012---I'm fighting for every man in the 82nd Ground Division.
罗斯  我能问你一件事吗012---Ross? Can I ask you something?
卡罗尔怀本的时候...012---When Carol was pregnant with Ben...
你有这么暴躁吗012---...were you this irritating?
你说什么  没事  你只是...012--- Excuse me?  Nothing. You're just...
你最近对我很不耐烦012---You've been a little short with me lately.
我无意惹毛你012---I'm not trying to irritate you.
那么你一定是有惹毛我的天份012---Well, then, you must have a natural talent for it.
医生马上就要过来了012---You know what? The doctor will be in soon.
我们在那之前还是别说话了吧012---Why don't we not speak until then?
好吧012---Okay.
呼吸声再大一点   罗斯  感觉真好012---Seriously. Breathe louder, Ross. That's great.
我们应该问医生她知不知道...012---We should ask the doctor if she even knows...
怎么接生半人半魔的孩子012---...how to deliver a baby that's half human, half pure evil!
朗医生  你好吗012---Hi, Dr. Long. How are you?
你对她倒很好012---You're nice to her.
她手上有药012---She has the drugs.
我帮你快速检查一下  好的012--- We'll do a quick check.  Okay.
已经迟了八天吗  对012--- So eight days late, huh?  Yeah.
你一定觉得很不舒服012---You must be getting a little uncomfortable.
对  只有一点012---Yeah, just a tad.
宫口已经扩张了八成  就快了012---You're 80% effaced. So you're on your way.
但你可能还得等上一阵子012---It still could last a while longer.
如果你很着急  有些方法可以促产012---If you're anxious, there are ways to help things along.
那就赶紧的吧012---Do them!
事实上你们可以自助012---Actually, they're things that you can do.
在家里做治疗012---Just some home remedies.
根据我的经验  我发现有些方法很有效012---In my experience, I've found some are very effective.
我们愿意尝试任何方法012---Well, we are ready to try anything.
好的  你可以喝一种药草茶012---Okay. There's an herbal tea you can drink.
你可以喝蓖麻子油  吃辣的食物012---You can take some castor oil. There's spicy foods.
我们全都愿意尝试012---Great. We will do all of those.
长时间散步  很好  没问题012--- Taking a long walk.  Good. Done.
据证实  最有效的方法就是做爱012---And there's the one that's proved most effective: Sex.
你一定是在开玩笑012---You've got to be kidding me!
演得好  乔伊  太棒了  超一流012---Good job, Joe! Well done! Topnotch!
你真的喜欢吗  当然喜欢012--- You liked it? You really liked it?  Oh, yeah!
你具体喜欢哪个部份012---Well, which part exactly?
整部电影  我们走吧012---The whole thing! Here we go!
不  说具体一点012---No, no, no. Give me some specifics.
我就喜欢具体细节  细节处理得最棒了012---I loved the specifics. The specifics were the best part.
有袋鼠出场的那场戏呢012---Hey, what about the scene with the kangaroo?
你喜欢吗012---Did you like that part?
看到一战的电影里出现袋鼠012---I was surprised to see a kangaroo
我吓了一大跳012---in a World War I epic.
你睡着了012---You fell asleep!
电影里面根本没有袋鼠012---There was no kangaroo!
我的建议他们一条都没采纳012---They didn't take any of my suggestions!
谢谢你来捧场  回头见012---Thanks a lot for coming. See you later.
别走  我很抱歉012---Don't go. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
看  这家伙睡着了012---Look, this guy fell asleep!
他也睡着了  生他的气啊012---He fell asleep too! Be mad at him!
或是叫救护车来012---Or call an ambulance!
医生说什么012---What did the doctor say?
知道宝宝何时会出生吗012---Any news on when the baby will come?
不知道  她教了我们一些促产的方法012---No. She gave us ideas on how to induce labor.
我们都试过了012---We tried them all.
我们去散了步  喝了茶012---We went for a walk, we tried special tea,
吃蓖麻子油跟辣的食物  全都没用012---castor oil, spicy food. Nothing has worked.
有个方法我们没试012---There is one thing we didn't try.
但某人觉得那会惹来大麻烦012---But someone thinks that that will open up a can of worms.
什么方法012---What is it? What is it?
如果有办法让宝宝今天就出生012---If it's gonna help bring the baby here, today...
我觉得你们应该试试看012---I mean, I think you should do it.
我们得做爱  那就做啊012--- It's sex.  Do it!
莫妮卡  你们很久没做爱了012--- Monica.  It's been a really long time for you.
我是说女人也有需要012---I mean, women have needs.
快去吧  满足你的需要012---Do it. Get yours.
这种事我可说不好012---Oh, I don't know about that.
我觉得如果你们两个做了爱012---I think if the two of you had sex,
那浮动诊胎法一定会出大问题012---the repercussions would be catastrophic.
好吧  我们实际一点012---All right, let's be practical.
如果罗斯不愿意012---If Ross isn't willing to do it,
这世上不只有他能跟你做爱012---he's not the only guy in the world you can have sex with.
你可以借用钱德勒  钱德勒很厉害012---You could borrow Chandler. Chandler is good.
莫妮卡  你这是怎么了012---Monica, what is the matter with you?
没什么  我只是希望宝宝能在今天出生012---Nothing. I just want the baby to be born today.
为什么一定要是今天012---Why? Why today?
好吧012---Okay, fine.
我一直在跟菲比打赌你会生012---I keep betting Phoebe that you're gonna have the baby,
我不想再输钱了012---and I don't want to lose again.
什么  她这么痛苦012---What? While she's been going through this hell,
你们却在赌钱012---you've been making money?
你们拿朋友持续经受痛苦来当赌注012---You're betting on your friend staying in this misery?
我也要赌  什么012--- I'll take that bet.  What?
我已经够惨了  还不如找点钱赚012---I'm miserable here. I may as well make some money out of it.
我也可以加入吗012---Can I get some of that action?
等等  现在变成我跟你们三个对赌012---Wait a minute. I'm betting against all of you?
别担心  我真的觉得明天就要生了012---Don't worry. I really do feel like tomorrow it's gonna happen.
好吧012---Okay.
嘿  睡美人012---Hey, Sleeping Beauty.
你跑到哪里去了  打电话都不接012---Where have you been? I try to call you.
我想跟你谈谈  我还是觉得很过意不去012---I want to talk to you. I still feel bad.
不是吧  你不开心了吗  睡不着觉了吗012---Oh, no. Were you upset? Did you lose sleep?
我很抱歉012---I'm so sorry.
我之所以过来解决我们之间的问题012---The reason I came over is to settle things between us.
是因为你帮了我很多忙012---You've done a lot for me in my career.
我想请你去看首映会来报答你012---I wanted to pay you back by taking you to the premiere,
但你却睡着了012---but you missed it.
我欠你多少钱  什么012--- So how much do I owe you?  What?
给我个数字  我不想欠你012---Give me a number. I don't want to owe you anything.
你什么都不欠我012---You don't owe me anything.
我不要你的...  说还就还012--- I don't want your...  We're doing this!
你帮我付第一次大头照的费用多少钱012---You got me my first headshots. How much were those?
我不知道  五百块012---I don't know, $500.
好吧  五百块  还有呢012---Okay, $500. What else?
还有第二组大头照012---Then there was the second set.
恶评如潮的"鼻涕虫"大头照012---The infamous "booger" headshots.
好吧  再加五百块012---Okay, so that's another $500.
五百加五百是...012---That's 500 and 500. That's...
你需要计算器吗  谢谢012--- You want a calculator?  Please.
拿去012---Here.
好吧  还有呢012---All right, what else?
还有表演课  舞台打斗课  踢踏舞课012---Well, there's acting classes, stagecombat classes, tap classes...
这些天知地知  你知我知就好012---Which we're still keeping under our hats.
我还付钱请教练012---Then there was that dialect coach who helped you with that play
教你说南方腔012---where you needed a southern accent.
上了20小时的课后  你还是满口牙买加腔012---Which, after 20 hours of lessons, still came out Jamaican.
你在胡说什么012---What the hell are you talking about?
"南方将会再起  兄弟"012---The South will rise again, man.
对  那笔钱花得很值得012---Yes, money wellspent.
好吧  还有呢  房租012---Okay, what else? Rent.
两三年的房租  水电费  伙食费012---Okay. Two, three years of rent, utilities, food...
好吧 我写张支票给你012---Okay, so I'm writing you a check for...
你不就是看我电影的时候睡着了嘛012---So you fell asleep during my movie.
没什么大不了的  对吧012---Big deal, right?
这玩意要怎么清除012---How do you clear this thing?
把你的墨西哥卷吃掉012---Come on. Finish your enchilada.
罗斯  我们试过所有的辛辣食品  根本没用012---Ross, we've tried all the spicy food. It's not working.
好吧  拿去  吃根辣椒012---Okay, here, have one of these peppers.
天啊  好辣  我的天啊012---Oh, God. So hot. Oh, my God.
对了  拿过辣椒之后012---By the way, you don't want to touch the pepper
别用手摸眼睛012---and then touch your eye.
我什么感觉都没有012---I am feeling nothing.
说到辣  看到你现在的样子012---Speaking of hot, watching you do that...
让我很想跟你做爱012---...really makes me want to have sex with you.
别闹了012---Stop it.
来嘛  罗斯  我们为什么要浪费时间012---Come on, Ross! Why are we wasting time with all this other stuff?
明知道这招很管用012---We know it's gonna work.
这是医生的建议012---It's doctorrecommended.
抱歉  但我们总该有点分寸012---I'm sorry. But we have to have some boundaries.
天啊  我快辣死了012---My God, I'm dying.
来嘛  罗斯012---Come on, Ross.
我们以前都做过  再做一次又怎样012---We've done it before. We'll do it again.
这也算是给我的怀孕期画上圆满句号了012---It'll be a nice way to bookend the pregnancy.
这太疯狂了  我不会因为要让你生孩子012---This is insane. I'm not gonna make love to you
就跟你做爱012---just so you'll go into labor.
做爱  你是娘娘腔吗012---Make love? What are you, a girl?
想让男人脱裤子  说这种话最管用了012---Always a great way to get into a man's pants.
你就当是在提供服务012---You'll be performing a service, okay?
把我当成一罐番茄酱012---Think of me as a ketchup bottle.
有时候你得敲敲瓶底才能把番茄酱倒出来012---Sometimes, you have to bang on the end of it to get it to come out.
我喜欢你满嘴淫话的样子012---I love when you talk dirty to me.
我知道  你说得对  那样一点都不性感012---I know it. You're right. That's not sexy.
我把叉子给掉了012---Oh, I seem to have dropped my fork.
我得弯下腰去捡012---Let me just bend over and get it.
天啊012---Oh, God!
好吧  够了  我是不会跟你做的012---Okay, enough. This is not going to happen.
来吧  罗斯  我真的很难受012---Come on, Ross. I'm miserable here.
来吧  这是你惹出来的事  你得负责到底012---Come on, you started this, now you finish it!
来吧  懦夫  跟我做爱吧012---Come on, wuss. Make love to me.
你知道吗  什么012--- You know what?  What?
算了012---Forget it.
怎么了  罗斯  你不想谈吗012---What now, Ross, you're not gonna talk?
你到底要惹我惹到什么时候012---How on earth will you ever annoy me?
等一下  我知道了012---Oh, wait a minute, I know.
你以为吃点辣椒012---I mean you'd think the damn jalepeno
就能治好你的鼻窦炎吗  才不会呢012---would've cleared up your sinuses, but no!
那可不够...你在干什么012---That's not enough... What are you doing?
我要让你把宝宝生出来012---I'm getting that baby out of you!
天啊  我知道012--- Oh, God!  I know.
不012---Oh, no, no, no.
我觉得我的羊水破了012---I think my water just broke.
我太厉害了012---I am good!
好吧  我拿了枕头还有包包012---Okay, I got the pillow. I got the bag.
你拿了钥匙吗  我拿了012--- You got the keys?  I got the keys.
我们的宝宝要出生了012---We're having a baby.
我还来不及看书上的这个章节012---I didn't have time to read this part of the books,
但你觉得我们还有时间...012---but do you think we have time...?
来不及了  好吧  我们走吧012--- Not so much.  Okay, let's go.
200  谢谢012--- 200.  Thank you.
就这样吧  我不在乎宝宝何时出生012---That's it. I'm done. I don't care when the baby comes.
我不想再赌了012---No more betting.
好吧012---Okay.
喂012---Hello?
好012---Okay.
我们再赌一次也无妨012---I guess we could bet one more time.
瑞秋要生了吗  你怎么知道012--- Is Rachel having the baby?  How did you know that?
乔伊  钱德勒  时间到了012---Joey! Chandler! It's time.
他们在咖啡厅012---They're at the coffee house.
你什么都知道012---You know everything!
等一下  我跟你赌宝宝超过七磅重012---Wait, double or nothing. I bet you the baby is over 7 pounds.
我跟你赌宝宝有头发  我跟你赌是女儿012---I bet you it has hair! I bet you it's a girl.
我们知道她要生女儿012---We know it's a girl.
我给你很高的赔率012---I'll give you really good odds.
到了012---All right!
太棒了  从家里到医院花了不到七分钟012---Yes! From home to the hospital in under seven minutes! 
我们办到了012---We did it.
对  最艰苦的部分彻底结束了012---Yes, the hard part is truly over.
打起精神来 012---No, but come on, 
我们算是开了个好头  对吧012---we're off to a great start, aren't we?
我知道可以很快赶过来012---I knew I'd get here fast.
但这个速度一定是创下了记录012---But this has gotta be some kind of a record!
你们赶到了  嗨012--- Oh, you made it!  Hi.
你们怎么会比我们先到  012---How the hell did you beat us here?
我们搭的计程车  你们是走过来的吗012---We took a cab. Did you guys walk?
不  我们也是搭计程车  但我做过实验...012---No, we took a cab too. But I did test runs...
你们赶到了012---Hey, you made it!
好吧  难不成有魔法地道通到这家医院吗012---Okay, is there some kind of magic tunnel to this hospital?
罗斯  你留下来聊天 012---Ross, you stay here and talk.
我要去生孩子了012---I'm gonna go have a baby.
好吧  你好  她是瑞秋·格林012---Okay. Hi, this is Rachel Greene.
我是罗斯·盖勒  我们在车上打过电话012---I'm Ross Geller. We called from the car.
对  我们为你们准备了双人待产室012---Right. We have a semiprivate labor room waiting for you, so...
对不起  双人房  012---Oh, whoa! I'm sorry. Semiprivate?
我们订了单人房012---We asked for a private room.
我知道  012---Yes, I see that here.
不幸地是我们无法保证一定有单人房012---Unfortunately, we can't guarantee a private room.
现在单人房都满了  012---And, currently, they're all unavailable.
你要是早点赶过来就好了012---Man, if only you'd gotten here sooner.
抱歉 我们只有双人待产室012---I'm sorry. Semiprivate rooms are all we have.
好吧  等我们一下  罗斯012---Okay. Just give us a second. Ross?
什么 012---Yeah?
塞点钱给她  012---Give her some money.
我觉得他们真的没房间了012---I really think they're out of rooms.
才怪  罗斯 012---They're not, Ross.
他们是为大人物留的012---They're just saving them for important people!
好吧  如果我是总统呢 012---Okay? What if I was the president?
那么我们的麻烦就大了 012---Well, then, we'd be in a lot of trouble.
你不知道任何国家的地理位置012---You don't know where any countries are.
好吧012---Okay.
你能再帮我们确认一遍吗 012---Say, would you mind checking again?
有没有我们可以使用的单人待产室 012---See if any private rooms may have opened up?
这里是医院012---This is a hospital.
好吧  你知道吗  我得说012---Okay, you know what? I have to say,
我真的不喜欢你的语气012---I don't really care for your tone.
这不是市里唯一一家医院012---And this is not the only hospital in this city,
我们完全可以... 天啊012---and we have no problem... Oh, gosh!
什么  是阵痛012--- What? What?  Contraction!
你们想看看双人待产室吗  012---Would you like to see a semiprivate room?
好吧  看看又何妨012---Yeah, it couldn't hurt to look.
《老友记》  第八季  第23集  瑞秋生孩子012---Friends S08E23 The One Where Rachel Has A Baby
你的子宫颈只开了两公分 012---Well, you're only two centimeters dilated,
得等开到十公分才行012---and we need to get to 10.
那得等上一段时间  好吧012--- It'll be a while.  Oh, okay.
我一小时后再回来帮你检查  谢谢012--- I'll be back in an hour to check you again. Thank you.

嗨  我是罗斯 012---Hi, I'm Ross. 
抱歉毁了你们的大好日子012---I'm here to ruin this magical day for you.
一点都不会  没关系的  012---Oh, no, not at all. It's okay.
马克·何格  她是我太太茱莉012---Marc Horger. This is my wife, Julie.
嗨  茱莉  她是瑞秋  012---Hi, Julie. This is Rachel.
嗨  瑞秋012---Oh, hi, Rachel.
这是你的第一胎  对012--- Is this your first?  Yeah, it is.
小吉米是我们的第三胎012---Well, little Jamie here is our third.
如果你们有问题012---So if you have any questions, 
或需要帮忙  叫我们一声就好012---or you need anything at all, just holler.
那真是太棒了  对012--- That's so sweet.  Yeah.
我之前把帘子拉开了  我来给你们留点隐私012---I opened this earlier but let me give you guys some privacy.
没关系  我们同舟共济012---Nonsense. We're all in this together.
我们愿意跟你们分享待产的每一刻012---We are gonna share every moment of this with you.
我想我们会相处得非常愉快  对012--- And I think we're gonna have some fun.  Yeah.
好吧  笑一个012--- Oh, okay, I guess.  Hey, smile!
我不知道...  我真的不要...012--- I don't know if...  I really don't want any...
谢谢012---Oh, thank you.
罗斯  我又开始阵痛了012---Oh, Ross! Here comes another contraction.
好吧  深呼吸012---Okay, just breathe.
老公  我也开始阵痛了  012---Oh, honey, I think I'm having one too!
来吧  不012--- Here you go!  Oh, no!
天啊012---Oh, my God!
你看012---Hey, look at this.
三个小时过去了还是没生012---Oh, wow. Three hours and still no baby.
生产的奇迹让人很想打磕睡012---The miracle of birth sure is a snoozefest.
你要看点好玩的事吗  012---Hey, you wanna see something?
当然  什么012---Sure. What?
这一定会很有意思012---This is gonna be fun.
看我怎么吓钱德勒012---Watch me freak out Chandler.
老公  什么事012--- Honey?  Yeah?
听着  我一直在想012---Listen, I've been doing some thinking...
我不知道是因为我们身处医院012---...and I don't know whether it's because we're here...
还是瑞秋要生孩子了012---...or Rachel's giving birth...
但我觉得我们应该开始造小孩了012---...but I think we should try to have a baby.
好吧012---Okay.
你说什么 012---What's that now?
好吧  我也一直在想这件事 012---Okay. I've been thinking about it too, 
我觉得我们准备好了012---and I think we're ready.
你在开玩笑吗  012---Are you kidding me?
你觉得我们现在就准备好要怀孕了012---You think we're ready to have a baby now?
这确实很好玩012---This is fun.
你们准备要怀孕了  012---You're ready to have a baby?
我的小男孩长大了012---My boy's all grown up!
你说你也准备好了012---You said you were ready too.
对  我只是想跟你开玩笑012---Yeah, but I was just screwing with you
逼你用高八度的怪声音说话012---to try to get your voice all high and weird...
就像我现在一样012---...like mine is now!
对  但你不是一直都想要生孩子吗 012---Yes, but haven't you wanted a kid, like, forever?
好吧  滚开  先生012---Okay, then, back off, mister!
我确实准备好生孩子了012---Because I am ready to have a baby.
我只是希望乔伊是孩子他爸012---I just want Joey to be the father.
什么  你疯了吗  012---What? Are you crazy?
就是那样  那就是我的目的012---That's it, right there! That's all I wanted!
实在抱歉  012---I am so sorry.
医生坚持要拉上帘子做检查012---The doctor insisted on closing the curtain for the exam.
那非常... 真的没关系012---Oh, that's very... Really, very, very okay.
茱莉的子宫颈开了七公分 012---Julie's cervix is dilated seven centimeters.
大约是四指宽012---That's about four fingers!
医生让我自己摸摸看  012---Doctor let me feel it myself.
你摸过瑞秋的子宫颈吗  罗斯012---Have you felt Rachel's cervix, Ross?
没有  我们不会那么做  我们不会那么做012--- No, we're not gonna do that.  We won't be doing that.
如果你愿意的话  你可以摸摸瑞秋的 012---Well, if you like, you could feel Rachel's, 
再摸摸我的做比较012---then feel mine to compare.
我打扰了你们吗  012---Am I interrupting?
太棒了  谢谢  待会见012---Yes! Thank you! Later.
不  你不能丢下我跟他们独处  对不起012--- No, you can't leave me alone with these people. Oh, I'm sorry.
不  罗斯  我的孩子没有父亲012---No, Ross? Ross? Ross? My child has no father!
很高兴你能过来  可能还要再等一阵 012---I'm so glad you're here, but it's gonna be a while.
你该先打电话来012---I wish you'd called first.
没关系  我待会再跟你爸来一趟012---That's all right. I'm coming back later with your father.
在孩子出生前  我得跟你谈一谈  012---I acturally needed to talk to you before the birth.
好吧  什么事012---Okay. What's up?
我有样东西要给你012---I brought something that I want to give you.
当然前提是你需要的话012---Assuming, of course, that you want it.
妈  你要我娶你吗012---Ma, you're asking me to marry you?
这是你外婆的订婚戒指 012---This is your grandmother's engagement ring.
我要你把它送给瑞秋012---I want you to give it to Rachel.
妈  不  别这样  012---Mom, no. Come on. 
谢谢你  听我说...012--- Thank you.  Just hear me out...
不要  我们谈过了012---No! Okay? We've been through this.
我们不会因为她怀孕了就去结婚  好吗 012---We're not gonna get married just because she's pregnant. Okay?
说真的  罗斯 012---Honestly, Ross, 
她不是你在酒吧泡到就上的女孩012---this isn't just some girl you picked up in a bar and humped.
罗斯  孩子应该要有个完整的家庭012---Ross, a child should have a family.
你知道吗  我现在无法思考此事  抱歉012---You know what? I can't deal with this right now. I'm sorry.
考虑一下吧 012---Just think about it.
如果你不收  我会再跟你谈上女孩的事012---If you don't, I'll talk more about humping.
给我吧012---Give me.
嗨  亲爱的  谢谢你赶过来012--- Hi, dear.  Hi. Thank you so much for coming.
罗斯  快进来012---Ross, get in here!
她把我拖出待产室 012---She dragged me out of the labor room 
问我为什么不跟瑞秋结婚012---to ask me why I'm not with Rachel.
对012---Yeah.
你为什么不跟瑞秋结婚  012---Why aren't you with Rachel?
你在开玩笑吗012---You're kidding, right?
我们不会因为孩子的关系就去办结婚012---Look, we're not gonna be together just because we're having this baby.
但你们俩看着很般配012---But it just seems that you two belong together.
别说了  现在我没法想这件事 012---Okay, stop it. I can't deal with this right now.
我得去等孩子出生012---I have to go have a baby.
对  孩子他妈是谁来着012---Right. And with who again?
他简直疯了 他为什么不想跟瑞秋结婚 012---He's crazy. Why doesn't he wanna be with Rachel?
就是啊012---I know.
说真的  她是个完美的姑娘012---Seriously, she's like the perfect woman.
我知道她拒绝了我...012---I mean, I know she turned me down...
如果她没有拒绝  她想跟我在一起012---...but if she hadrt and she wanted to be with me...
我会抱着她...012---...I would take her in my arms and...
我有一阵子没有这样吓你们了吧 012---I haven't bummed you guys out like this in a while, have I ?
那是谁  新来的012--- Who's that?  New people.
恶心夫妇怎么了 012---What happened to the Disgustingtons?
他们去生孩子了 012---They're having their baby.
这不公平  罗斯  是我先来的012---It's not fair, Ross. I got here first!
你离开不久  他们就将她推进产房了012---Right after you left, they wheeled her off into delivery.
但她走之前  她的产道如鲜花怒放012---Oh, but not before she gave me a nice, juicy shot of little Jamie
画面十分生动012---just crowning away.
抱歉012---Wow. Sorry.
新来的人怎么样012---So how are the new people?
他们给对方起的昵称都很奇怪012---Well, they have some unusual pet names for each other.
其中有"恶婆娘"和"臭混蛋"012---Including "Evil Bitch" and "Sick Bastard."
天啊  阵痛  012---Oh, gosh, a contraction.
是吗  好了  深呼吸012---Yeah? Okay, okay. Just breathe.
你在看她吗  不012--- Are you looking at her?  No!
别看她  你个臭混蛋012---Don't you look at her, you sick bastard!
我发誓  没有在看她 012---Honey, I swear I wasn't looking at her!
她在生小孩012---She's in labor.
你喜欢吗  你个狗娘养的012---You like that, you sick son of a bitch?
我还是把...012---I'm just gonna...
看吧  都是你偷看的关系  变态死胖子012---See? It's because you were looking, you fat pervert.
不  我相信没有人在偷看 012---No, no. I'm sure no one was looking.
我们只是需要一点隐私012---Just want some privacy.
你想念你的女朋友吗 012---You miss your girlfriend?
别管他们012---Just ignore them.
你没事吧  没事012--- You okay?  Yeah.
罗斯  怎么了012--- Ross.  What?
他在盯着我看012---He's looking at me.
你还想活着看到自己的孩子出生吗012---You wanna live to see your baby?
你竟敢这么跟我老公说话  你个臭混蛋012---Don't you talk to my husband like that, you stupid bastard!
天啊  如果你那么想要孩子  去偷一个吧012---Oh, good God! If you want a baby so bad, just go steal it!
你是怎么了  012---What is going on with you.
你什么时候这么喜欢孩子了012---Since when are you so crazy about babies?
我不是喜欢孩子  我是喜欢和你在一起012---I'm not crazy about babies. I'm crazy about us.
什么 012---What?
我们总是说以后要生孩子 012---We've always talked about having babies someday, 
我没说非得是现在012---I'm not saying it has to be right now, 
但我觉得我们现在能应付得来  012---...but I'm starting to think that we can handle it. 
我们准备好了012---We're good.
我们真的准备好了012---We're really good.
我们准备齐全了012---We are pretty good.
但你没准备好前我是不会行动的012---But nothing has to happen until you're ready.
也许我现在就准备好了012---Well, maybe I'm ready now.
虽说稍微有点吓人  但感觉对了012---I mean, it's a little scary, but maybe it's right.
什么感觉对了012---What? It's not right!
我们还没有准备好要生孩子012---We're not ready to have a kid now!
什么  012---What? 
我在开玩笑  这一定会很好玩012---I'm kidding. This is gonna be fun.
我们要试试看吗  我们现在就要试吗 012---So we're gonna try? I mean, we're trying?
我们要试着怀孕012---We're trying to get pregnant.
我不想在宝宝面前干这种勾当012---I'm not comfortable doing this in front of the babies.
你想什么时候开始试  012---So when do you want to start trying? 
好吧  等一下012---All right, hold on a sec.
你在算生理周期  对012--- Period math?  Yeah.
我们可以从现在开始012---Well, we could start trying now.
在这里吗  不是012--- Right here?  No, not here.
这里也可以啊012---Maybe here.
这里太适合了  我们有大把时间要消磨012---It's perfect. We got a lot of time to kill,
而且医院里到处都是床012---and we're in a building that's full of beds!
还很干净012---And it's so clean!
快点  你这台蠢机器  来嘛012---Come on, you stupid machine! Come on!
把你的钱吃掉了吗  012---It ate your money? 
没有012---No.
那么楼下见  好吧012--- I'll see you downstairs then.  All right.
我拿到了012---Hey, I got one! I got one!
上还是下  下楼  谢谢012--- Oh, up or down?  Oh. Down, please.
我讨厌抢男人的风头  但可以由我来吗 012---I hate to be a ballbuster, but can I just do it?
麻烦你帮我按上  没问题012--- Could you press up too?  Sure.
我真的很遗憾  我也曾摔断过腿  012---I feel bad for you. I broke my leg once too.
是吗  你怎么会摔断腿012---Yeah? How'd yours happen?
说来话长  有点丢脸012---Well, it's a long story, it's kind of embarrassing.
其实是性爱手册排版上出了点小错误012---Let's just say there was a typographical error with a sex manual.
你呢  车祸012--- How about you?  Car accident.
有个白痴在打手机  没注意看路012---Let me guess. Some idiot on a cell phone wasn't paying attention?
对  就是我012---Yeah. Me.
我的电梯来了012---Oh, hey, that's me.
我猜你是来探病的  没错012--- Hey, I take it you're just visiting someone.  Yeah.
如果你有时间  想探望其他人...012---Well, if you have some time and you wanna visit someone else...
对  我很乐意012---Yeah, I would like that.
等一下  不要啊  012---Wait! What? No! 
电梯等等012---Elevator! No!
你得按按钮才行012---You gotta press the button.
护士说他们要送另一位女人过来012---The nurse said they're bringing in another woman.
她已经怀孕了吗 012---Oh. Is she pregnant yet?
她根本不需要怀孕012---She doesn't need to be.
她还是能赶在我之前把孩子生下来012---She'll still have the baby before I do.
罗斯  我又阵痛了  好吧012--- Oh, Ross! Another contraction.  Oh, okay. Here, here.
没错012---That's it.
听起来好像很痛  没错012--- Oh, that sounded like a bad one.  Yeah, it was.
我的阵痛没有那么厉害  又来了012---Mine haven't been so bad. Oh, here comes one now.
真的好痛012---Oh, that was a big one.
打扰一下  你能帮我个忙吗 012---Excuse me, could you help me with something?
我在找一位一条腿骨折的病人012---The patient I'm looking for has a broken leg.
他坐着轮椅  31到35岁  非常迷人012---He's in a wheelchair. He's early to mid30s, very attractive.
我知道你在说谁  012---I know who you're talking about.
太棒了  他住几号病房012---Great! What room number is he in?
小姐  对不起012---Ma'am, I'm sorry.
只有医院人员能查看资料012---That information is restricted to hospital staff.
她跟我是一起的  德雷克·拉莫瑞医生  012---She's with me. Dr. Drake Ramoray.
哪个德雷克医生012---Dr. Drake who?
拉莫瑞  那是葡萄牙姓氏012---Ramoray. It's Portuguese.
我们需要他的资料  我是医生012---We need that information. I'm a doctor.
这间医院的医生  012---A doctor at this hospital?
该死  我们正在浪费宝贵的时间012---Damn it, we're losing precious time.
你希望头上沾上这个男人的血...012---You want this man's blood on your head...?
是手  手上012--- Hands.  Hands!
你必须告诉我012---It is absolutely essential that you tell me 
我助手描述的病人住几号病房012---what room the man my assistant described is staying in.

我真的很佩服你做的事 你要自己抚养她012---Can I just say, I really admire what you're doing.Just raising her all alone.
我不是一个人  我有罗斯012---Oh, I'm not doing it alone. I have Ross.
现在是的  如果他认识别人结了婚 那时又会是怎么样的呢?012---Oh, sure. Now.But what happens when he meets somebody else and gets married?
他会离婚的 那就是罗斯012---Well, then he gets a divorce. It's Ross.

男人都说他们会在 但他们会成立自己的家庭012---They all say they're gonna be there, until they start their real family.
 罗斯不会那么做的  以前我也那么相信012---That's never gonna happen with Ross.That's what I thought about my first husband.
如果我的孩子能跟她爸 及新的波霸小姐共度一个周末...012---Now, I'm lucky if my kid gets to spend the weekend with her father...

天啊  你看到那孩子的鼻子了吗?012--- Man, you see the kid on that nose?
你知道我刚刚想到什么吗?012--- You know what I was thinking about? 
我们出门前的那个吻 那真的很特别吧?012---Um, that kiss before we left the apartment.That was something, huh?
对  真的是012---Yeah. Yeah, it really was.
但我们...我们得小心点012---But we, we gotta be careful.

她在里面吗?012---She in there?
对  护士正把她放在床上 那就是她012---Yeah. She's putting her down now. That's her.
你看  快看艾玛012---Look at Emma.
我无法决定 她长得像你或瑞秋012---I just can’t decide who she looks more alike, you or Rachel?
什么?你在开玩笑吗? 她美极了  完全是瑞秋的遗传012---Oh what are you kidding? She’s gorgeous, it’s all Rachel.
对不起  这是我最后一次问你 你们两个为什么不结婚?012---I'm sorry. For the last time, why aren't you two together again?
不  我知道 因为你们没有到那个程度012---No, I know. Because you're not in that place.
那真的很棒 但事实上你们真的到了012---Which would be fine, except you totally are.
情况很复杂  好吗?012---It's complicated, okay?
对  那是真的012---Yeah, that's true.

瑞秋跟我 现在过得很好012---It's just, Rachel and I, we're doing really well right now.
我知道  如果你想更进一步 就得突破现状012---I know. I know. I know. I know, and if you try to make it more you might wreck it.
 没错  对012--- Yeah, exactly.  Right.
或许你可以得到 你从15岁开始梦想的世界012---Or you might get everything you've wanted since you were 15.

我看到一个女人 同时在喂双胞胎母乳012---I just saw a woman breastfeeding both of her twins at the same time.

他会去过自己的生活012---...and he's gonna have his own life.
对吧?012---Right?
我猜你说的对012---Yeah, I guess so.
我没有想过 我要自己抚养这个宝宝012---I just never thought I'd be raising this baby all by myself.
