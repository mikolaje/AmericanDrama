你刚刚说是瑞秋吗012---I'm sorry, did you just say it's Rachel?
对012---Yes.
你喜欢瑞秋012---You like Rachel?
对  我喜欢瑞秋012---Yes. I like Rachel.
瑞秋012---Rachel?!
对  听着  你知道的012---Yeah. Okay, but look, you know...
你知道我还喜欢谁吗  你012---You know who else I like? You.
这句话我说得不够多  我喜欢你  罗斯012---And it doesn't get said enough. I like you, Ross.
那个"瑞秋"  没什么大不了的012--- "Rachel" Rachel?  It's not a big deal.
没什么大不了的  抱歉  我只是...012---It's not a big deal? I'm sorry, I just...
那你刚刚说的那些话呢012---What about the stuff you said?
你说你没法不去想她012---How you can't stop thinking about her?
你说你睡不着012---How you can't sleep?
我是个演员  你知道吗012---I'm an actor, you know?
我们演员习惯了夸大事实012---As a group, we tend to be overdramatic.
怀着我孩子的瑞秋012---Rachelwho'scarryingmybaby Rachel?
我知道这样很不好  这样是不对的  好吗012---I know it's bad. And I know it's wrong, okay?
但我们不可能在一起啊012---But it's not like anything's ever gonna happen.
那只是我的一时好感  会慢慢变淡的012---These are just feelings. They'll go away.
我得走了012---You know, I gotta go.
别这样  罗斯012---Hey, come on, Ross...
我只是...  我只有一个...  瑞秋012---I just... You know, I just have one... Rachel?!
瑞秋012---Rachel?!
瑞秋012---Rachel?!
《老友记》  第八季  第16集  乔伊告诉了瑞秋012---Friends S08E16 The One Where Joey Tells Rachel
她在踢我012---Okay, she's kicking.
她在你的体内成长012---She's growing inside you.
这一下踢得好用力012---That was a big one.
她是拒绝过我最年轻的女孩012---I think that's the youngest girl ever to reject me.
大家好  嗨012--- You guys!  Hey there.
我来问你们  你们相信有灵魂伴侣吗012---Listen let me ask you. Do you believe in soul mates?
我相信012---Oh, yes, I do.
我认为每个人都有012---I do. I believe that there is one perfect person
失落的另一半012---out there for everyone.
你知道你该怎么找到他吗  停下寻找的步伐012---You know how you find him? You stop looking for him.
所以我已经不去费劲寻找罗素·克洛了012---That's why I stopped looking for Russell Crowe.
他会找到我的012---He'll find me.
你呢012---And you?
不  我相信有些人彼此适合012---No. I believe that certain people are more suited for each other,
我也相信两人可以相爱  但...012---and I believe in falling in love, but...
我不相信存在灵魂伴侣  很好012--- Soul mates? I don't think they exist.  Okay, good.
怎么了  昨晚我遇到了莫妮卡的灵魂伴侣012--- Why?  Well, last night, I met Monica's.
什么  没错012--- What?  Yeah.
跟我约会的那个男人012---I had a date with this guy.
我发誓他是她的另一半012---And I swear to god he's her other half.
别犯傻了  你不觉得会有人012---Come on, don't be crazy. You don't think there's somebody out there
比我更适合莫妮卡吧012---better suited for Monica than me, do you?
他长什么样子012---Well, what's he like?
他很高  棕发  当然012--- He's tall. He has brown hair.  Of course.
一个发色跟我一样的高大男人012---A tall guy with hair similar to mine?
宇宙真的神秘莫测012---Oh, unknowable universe!
他从事跟食物相关的行业012---He works with food.
当然  年纪比较大吗012---Oh, sure. Older?
没错  他是英国人012---Obviously. And he's British.
我正打算要问你  是啊012--- I was just gonna ask!  Yeah.
他非常聪明  成熟  有自信012---And he's so centered, and mature and confident.
真可惜他们彼此不认识012---It's so sad they never had a chance to meet.
还好她老公没听到你说这种话012---Luckily, the guy she settled for can't hear what you're talking about.
抱歉  我可能搞错了012---Oh, I'm so sorry. Maybe I'm wrong.
我会再跟他约会  对他进一步了解012---I'm gonna go out with him again. I'll find out more.
你明明觉得他跟别人是天生一对012---You believe that this guy is destined for someone else
你还要跟他约会012---and you're still gonna date him?
虽说他不是我的灵魂伴侣  但我总得吃饭吧012---He may not be my soul mate, but a girl's gotta eat.
我刚跟乔伊谈过  我想知道你好不好012---I just talked to Joey. I wanted to see you how you were.
我还是不敢相信  乔伊跟瑞秋012---I still can't believe it. Joey and Rachel?
就像是你跟我交往  只不过更奇怪012---It's like you and me going out, only weirder.
我知道你很难过  我也想安慰你...012---I know you're hurting, and I want to be supportive,
但别再说那种话了012---...but don't say that again.
他们要是结婚了怎么办012---Oh, my god. What if they get married?
他可能做我孩子的继父012---He'd be the stepfather of my child.
我觉得你不必担心这种事情012---Honey, I don't think that's something we need to worry about!
他不会把自己的感觉告诉她012---First of all, he'll never tell her how he feels about her.
就算他说了 你也不知道她会有什么反应012---And even if he did, you have no idea how she'd react.
女人从来就不喜欢乔伊  我觉得他还是处男012---Sure, women never like Joey. I think he's a virgin.
他根本就没想过要追瑞秋  真的吗012--- Joey isn't even thinking about going after Rachel.  He's not?
对  他关心的是你对此事的反应012---No, all he's thinking about is how you're taking this.
这件事把他吓坏了012---Listen, it's completely freaking him out.
他甚至想搬到佛蒙特州去012---He's talking about moving to Vermont.
为什么  他想离开这个国家012--- Why?  He says he wants to leave the country.
他觉得你恨他012---He thinks you hate him.
恨他012---Hate him?
不  我不恨他012---No, I don't hate him.
那可是瑞秋  你知道吗012---It's just, it's Rachel. You know?
我无法想像你有多难过...012---I can't even imagine how hard this must be for you...
但我不希望你跟乔伊因此做不成朋友012---...but I don't want you to lose Joey over it.
现在他想知道你是不是还把他当朋友012---Right now, he just needs to know that you're still his friend.
好吧  我会跟他谈012---Okay, I'll talk to him.
你最好快去012---Do it soon.
他刚刚问我怎么把美金换成佛蒙特货币012---He just asked me how to convert his dollars into Vermont money.
钱德勒  莫妮卡  他是唐  你们好012--- Chandler, Monica, this is Don.  Hello.
你好  幸会012---Hello, nice to meet you.
你好吗  灵魂伴侣012--- How are you?  Soul mate.
你们刚才有什么活动012---So, what have you guys been doing?
我们在艾德瑞提卡吃了顿难以下咽的午餐012---Well, we just had a terrible lunch today at Adriatica.
那家餐厅的番茄干是怎么回事012---What's with the sundried tomatoes in that place?
就是  难道现在还是1985年吗012---I know! Is this 1985?
我就是那么说的  菲比  这很奇怪吧012---That's exactly what I said. Phoebe, isn't that strange.
一点都不会012---Not really.
番茄干怎么了012---What's wrong with sundried tomatoes?
洒在烤鸡披萨上012---On a barbecuedchicken pizza?
不是吗012---No?
唐  你还喜欢哪家餐厅012---So, Don. What other restaurants do you like?
奥克塔维欧  27与7012---Octavio. 27and7.
还有亚利山多洛斯012---There's this great little place, Alessandro's.
天啊  我是那里的主厨012---Oh, my God! That's my restaurant, I'm the chef there.
开玩笑吧  你做的菜好吃极了012---You're kidding me! Your food is fantastic!
我要跟你谈谈你的菜单012---I really want to talk about your menu,
我先去买杯咖啡  还有人要喝吗012---once I get some coffees first. Um, anyone want any?
我要喝拿铁012---Oh, I'd like a latte.
如果你要谈我的事012---You know what? If you're gonna talk about me,
我就跟你一起去012---I'm gonna go with you.
你这是要干什么012---What are you doing?
我发誓我不知道你们在这里012---Nothing. I swear to god, I didn't know you guys would be here.
还好你不相信灵魂伴侣  所以012---And the good news is you don't even believe in soul mates, so...
但我相信英俊的陌生人要追我老婆012---I believe in tall, handsome strangers who hit on my wife.
他们不过是聊天而已012---They're just talking, and you know what?
就算我认为他们是灵魂伴侣012---Just because I think they're soul mates
那也不代表会发生什么事012---doesn't mean anything'll happen.
菲比  做得好012---Phoebe? Good work.
他太棒了  我爱他012---He's great. I love him.
别担心  我们会帮你再找个老婆012---Don't worry, we'll find you someone else.
如果你是来打我的  我能理解  这是我活该012---I understand if you came by to hit me. I deserve it.
不  我不想打你012---No, I don't want to hit you.
怎么  你要踢我012---What, then? Kick me?
不012---No.
咬我012---Bite me?
我不想对你怎么样012---I don't want to do anything to you.
我只想告诉你  我没有生你的气012---I just want to tell you that I'm not mad at you...
我当然也不恨你012---...and that I certainly do not hate you.
我只是来告诉你这些012---I just came here to say that.
等一下  罗斯012---Hey, wait, Ross, Ross?
你想进来喝瓶啤酒吗012---You wanna come in for a beer or something?
好吧012---Yeah, sure.
你带啤酒了吗012---You got any beer?
我只有瑞秋留下的香瓜饮料012---All I got is melon stuff that Rachel left.
好吧012---Okay.
罗斯  有件事你得知道012---Look, Ross. You need to understand something, okay?
我...012---I...
我绝不会对瑞秋采取行动  好吧012---I am never gonna act on this Rachel thing, okay?
我不会做出任何会危及你我友谊的事012---I wouldn't do anything to jeopardize my friendship with you.
谢谢012---Thank you.
总之  我只是...012---Anyway, it'll just...
我得花点时间去淡忘012---It'll take me a while to get over her, that's all.
我不确定我该怎么做012---I'm not even sure how to do that,
我以前从没陷入过爱河  所以012---I mean I've never been in love before, so...
什么012---What?
你爱上她了吗012---You're in love with her?
对  我以为你知道  不知道012--- Yeah. I thought you knew that.  No.
听着  如果有帮助的话012---Look, if it helps,
我真的也不希望自己有那种感觉012---I don't want to feel this way, honest.
我只是一直在想012---I just keep thinking,
"我得忘了这件事"  你知道吗012---"I'll get over this," you know?
但我越努力就越忘不了012---But it just keeps getting harder.
我不知道该怎么办012---I don't know what to do, you know?
我该怎么办012---I don't... What do I do?
我觉得你该告诉她你的感觉012---I think you need to tell her how you feel.
你一定是被这饮料冲昏了头012---Okay, that's the green stuff talking.
我是认真的  你得知道她的感觉012---No, I'm serious. You need to find out where she is.
如果她不喜欢你012---Because if she's not where you are,
你就可以放下了012---then you can start to move past this.
但如果...  我不是说她会这么说012---But what if, and I'm not saying she will be...
如果她喜欢你...012---If she is where you are, then...
那我的感受不该妨碍到你们012---...then my feeling weird shouldn't stand in the way.
你确定  对012--- Are you sure?  Yeah.
如果她要跟别的男人在一起...012---Look, if she's gonna end up with somebody else...
说真的  她找不到更好的人选了012---...the truth is, she couldn't find a better guy, so...
谢谢012---Hey, thanks.
你准备什么时候要跟她谈012---So when do you think you're gonna talk to her?
天啊  我得跟她谈012---Oh, my God. I have to tell her.
我还没有想过  我该说什么012---I haven't thought about what I will say. What should I say?
我能体谅你  但不要太过激动了012---I'm understanding, but let's not get carried away.
抱歉012---I'm sorry. Sorry.
我该说什么012---What am I gonna say?
我也觉得超难喝012---Yeah, tell me about it.
我逐渐放弃了红酒进口的问题012---So I've been slowly phasing out the wine importing
现在全力研究奶酪012---and focusing more on the cheese side of things.
你说奶酪吗012---Cheese, you say?
这研究起来可真够臭气熏天的  唐012---That's some pretty smelly work, huh, Don?
对不起  奶酪很臭012--- Excuse me?  Cheese. It's smelly.
你一定也经常臭气四溢012---You must smell a lot of the time too.
不会的  但我觉得奶酪012---Not really. But when it comes to cheese,
越臭越好012---I'm one of the people who thinks the smellier, the better.
我也是  钱德勒就受不了012---Me too! Chandler can't stand it.
他都不让我在家吃蓝纹奶酪012---He won't even allow me to have blue cheese in the house.
那你还嫁给了他012---And you're still married to him?
知道我想干嘛吗012---You know what I'd love to do?
我想去法国  只吃面包跟奶酪012---I would like to go to France and eat nothing but bread and cheese.
甚至连面包都不吃  只要奶酪012---Not even bread. Just cheese.
不  我要面包012---No, I want the bread.
还有油酥饼012---And pastries.
跟小蛋糕012---And pate.
我并不是真的兴奋  只是以前我很胖012---I'm really not high. It's just I used to be fat.
我在罗亚尔谷有栋别墅012---Well if you where ever enter the Loire valley let me know,
你如果去法国可以住在那里012---I've got a great little villa you can stay at.
是用奶酪做的吗012---Is it made of cheese?
不是  不过用奶酪做的房子  简直宛如天堂012---No. A house made of cheese, wouldn't that be incredible?
我明天就想搬进去  少来了012--- I'd move in tomorrow!  Oh, come on!
你听到了吗  对不起012--- Are you listening to this!  I'm so sorry.
我们该怎么办  我不知道012--- What do we do?  I don't know.
他们都想住在奶酪屋里012---They both want to live in a house of cheese.
我不知道你该拿什么去抗争012---I don't know how you fight that.
好吧  我能做到012---Okay, okay. I can do this.
我可以告诉她我的感觉012---I can tell her how I feel.
好吧  挺直腰杆012---Okay, stand up straight.
深呼吸012---Take a couple deep breaths.
表现出自信012---Look confident.
乔伊  怎么了012---Joey? What's up?
我来找你  是想告诉你一件事012---I just came by because I want to talk to you about something.
怎么了012---Okay. What's up?
就在走廊上谈  我们是畜生吗012---Here, in the hall? What are we, animals?
我开会要迟到了  你能快点说吗012---I'm late for a meeting. Could you make it quick?
我是来告诉你...012---I just came by to tell you that...
我今天想跟你一起吃晚餐012---...I want to have dinner with you tonight.
没问题012---Sure. That sounds great!
给我留言  告诉我到哪里找你012---Just leave me a message and tell me where to meet you. Okay?
好吧  这样也不错012---Okay. That's good.
这又给你几小时的时间012---Okay, that give you a couple hours
准备好谈话内容  不错012---to prepare what you're gonna say. Good. Yeah.
你们就不会敲门吗012---Don't you people ever knock?
我想请唐跟菲比过来012---I'd like to have Don and Phoebe over.
不错吧  没问题  你去安排吧012---Wouldn't that be nice?  Sure. Why don't you set it up?
我就坐着看看征婚广告012---I'll just be over here browsing through the personals.
你没事吧  你有点怪怪的012---Are you okay? You're acting weird all afternoon.
没事  算不上心情大好012---Yeah. Fine. Not perfect.
但也很不错了012---But good enough.
天啊  你这是怎么了012---Jeez, what's with you?
抱歉  你刚刚说"奶酪"吗012---I'm sorry, did you say "cheese"?
怎么了012---All right. What's going on?
菲比说你跟唐是灵魂伴侣012---Phoebe thinks you and Don are soul mates.
我不迷信那种事情012---I don't believe in that kind of stuff,
但你们两个一拍即合012---but then you two totally get along.
如果你想跟唐住在奶酪屋里012---So, look, I won't stand in your way if you wanna run off with Don
我可以退出012---and live in a house of cheese.
钱德勒  你不相信灵魂伴侣012---Chandler, you don't believe in soul mates?
对  但我相信"番茄干先生"相信012---No, but I'm sure "tomahtoes" does.
我也不相信灵魂伴侣012---I don't believe in soul mates, either.
你不相信吗  对012--- You don't?  Nope.
我觉得我们并非注定要在一起012---I don't think you and I were destined to end up together.
而是陷入爱河  努力经营我们的感情012---I think that we fell in love and work hard at our relationship.
有时候要加倍努力经营012---Some days we work really hard.
那你不想跟唐住在奶酪屋里吗012---So you don't want to live with Don in a cheese house?
不  我后来又仔细想了一下012---No, I've had second thoughts about that.
你知道打扫起来有多辛苦吗012---Do you realize how hard it'd be to clean?
我爱你  我知道012--- I love you.  I know.
我今晚要带你去吃晚餐012---You know what? I'm gonna take you out to dinner tonight.
那家餐馆的墨西哥辣椒卷012---I found this place that makes the greatest mozzarella sticks
天下无双012---and jalepino poppers.
不吃吗  真的很好吃012---No? Really? They taste so good.
我知道钱德勒只是开玩笑012---And I know Chandler is kidding,
但他每次一摸我的肚子就会这样012---but it happens whenever he touches my stomach.
我真的担心宝宝不喜欢他012---I mean I'm really worried the baby won't like him.
你没事吧  没事012--- Are you okay?  Yeah, sure.
听着  我之所以...012---Look, the reason...
这里很热吗012---Is it hot in here?
我不觉得  不过你可以把毛衣脱掉012---Not for me, but why don't you take off your sweater?
我也想  但这个地方挺上档次012---I would, but this is a nice place...
而我的T恤上印了卡尔文干荷比丝的图案012---...and my Tshirt has a picture of Calvin doing Hobbes.
天啊  真的吗  我能看一下吗012---Oh, my God, really? Can I see it?
当然可以012---Yeah, sure.
我觉得荷比丝可不想那么"干"012---I wouldn't think Hobbes would like that so much.
我们认识多久了012---How long have we known each other?
七  八...012---Seven, eight...
八年了012---Eight years. Wow.
真的很久了  是啊012--- A long time.  Yeah.
但过去几星期以来我...012---But over the past few weeks, I...
好吧  抱歉让你们久等  今天客人真的很多012---Okay! Sorry about the wait, but it is megajammed in here.
今晚的特餐是...012---We have a couple specials tonight...
你能等一下再来吗  好吧012--- Actually could you give us a second?  Sure.
时间到012---Second's up!
你们不是那种能开玩笑的客人012---Not that kind of table.
你要说什么012---So you were saying?
我不确定012---I'm not quite sure.
你问我们认识了多久012---Okay. You asked how long we knew each other,
我说八年012---and I said eight years.
后来服务生走过来  害他损失了一半的小费012---Then the waiter came over and cut his tip in half...
我们就说到这里了012---...and now here we are.
没错012---Yeah. Here we are.
我...012---I...
我想我爱上你了012---I think I'm falling in love with you.
什么012---What?
我爱上你了012---I'm falling in love with you.
你在跟谁说话012---Who are you talking to?
你在开玩笑  这是闹着玩的012---Oh, you're kidding. It's a joke.
真的很好笑012---Funny. It's funny!
我没找到笑点012---I don't get it.
好吧012---Okay.
你...012---Are you...?
怎么会...012---How did...?
什么时候012---When?
那真的重要吗012---Does it really matter?
这里确实好热012---It is hot in here.
我知道这很难接受012---Rach, I know this is a lot.
你什么都不必说012---You don't have to say anything.
你要花多少时间思考都可以012---You take as much time as you need.
好吧  你得说句话012---Okay, you gotta say something.
乔伊  我非常爱你012---Joey, Joey, I love you so much.
但是...  但是012--- But...  But.
乔伊012---Joey?
对  那...012---Right. Hey, that's...
没关系  真的012---That's okay. That's fine.
我早就料到你会这样012---It's pretty much what I was expecting.
那没什么大不了的  好吗012---So it's no big deal, all right?
我觉得我该走了012---I think I'm gonna go.
乔伊  请不要这样离开012---No, Joey. Please don't leave like this.
你不能这样对一个孕妇012---You can't do this to a pregnant woman!
别哭了012---Don't start doing that.
你不能那么做  瑞秋  你都要把我弄哭了012---You can't do that, Rach, because you're gonna make me...
我们一起哭吧012---Oh, there we go!
可以吗  没问题012--- Can I?  Sure.
乔伊  我不想失去...012---Oh, Joey. I don't want to lose...
不会的  好吗  永远不会012---You can't, okay? Ever.
我真的很抱歉  别这样  瑞秋012--- I'm so sorry.  No, no, no, Rach.
请你不要那么说012---Please don't be sorry.
好吧  别感到抱歉012---Okay? Don't be sorry.
我只是在开玩笑012---You know, I was only kidding.
对  这个笑话很搞笑012---Yeah, that was a real good one.
