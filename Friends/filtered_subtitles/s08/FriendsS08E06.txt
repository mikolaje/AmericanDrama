谢谢  拿去吧012--- Thank you.  There.
你这是什么  应该还没有正规的命名012--- So, what are you?  I don't think they have a name for it.
我一紧张就会满身大汗012---I get nervous, and I sweat like crazy.
不  我是指你的服装  我扮成了太阳系012--- No, I meant your costume.  I'm a solar system.
是我的学生们帮我做的  我教二年级012---Yeah, my students helped me make it. I teach the second grade.

如果猫女跟女超人打架  谁会赢呢012---Who do you think would win in a fight, Catwoman or Supergirl?
当然是猫女  是吧012--- Catwoman, hands down.  Yeah.
但你跟菲比  我赌菲比会赢012---Between you and Phoebe ? I'd give the edge to Phoebe.
什么  真的吗  你开什么玩笑012--- What? Really?  You kidding?
菲比在街上混过  好吗012---Phoebe lived on the street, okay?
而且她生起气来跟疯婆子一样012---Plus, she's got a crazy temper.
她没有站在我后面吧012---She's not right behind me, is she?
不  你很安全012---No, you're fine.
我能打倒瑞秋吗  我不确定012--- Could I take Rachel?  I'm not sure.

我们在乌拉圭做义工时012---In fact, when we were building in Uruguay,
只相距两个小镇远  却从来没见过面012---we were two towns apart and we never met.
对  我刚到时那里一片荒芜012---Yeah. It wasn't a town when I got there,
但我离开时那里已经是个小镇了012---but it was a town when I left.
我们去一醉方休吧  没问题012--- Shall we get me really drunk?  Sure.

我更想要钱012---I'd rather have the money.
那由不得你来选  万圣节快乐012---That's not your choice. Happy Halloween!
这不公平012---This isn't fair.
你只要披上斗篷012---Is it fair that all you did was put on a cape
我就要白送你东西  那公平吗012---and I gotta give you free stuff?
闭嘴012---Shut up!

我去拿支票簿012---Let me get my checkbook!
亲爱的  你不必这么做012---Look, honey. You don't have to do this, okay?
你强大的内心才是我最看重的012---It's the strength you have inside that means the most to me.
你既忠心又老实  而且还为人正直012---You're loyal, and you're honest and you have integrity.
这才是我希望在深爱的男人身上看到的品质012---That's the kind of strength I want in a man that I love.
那对我来说毫无意义  来吧012---That means nothing to me. Come on!
嗨  骗子012---Hi, liar.
他之所以会娶你012---You know, the only reason he's marrying you
是因为他以为你说的话都是真的012---is because he thinks the things you were saying were true.
有可能是真的  但你在说慌012--- They could be true.  But they're not.
真假只有一线之隔012---Yeah. It's a fine line.
你为什么要说谎  我不知道012--- Why are you lying to him?  I don't know.
他跟我说自己做过的事  我说我也做过012---He said he did all these stuff, I said I did it too.
他就变得很兴奋  我觉得很好玩012---and he got so excited, it was really fun.
亲爱的012---Honey?
这是个坏习惯  我要你马上戒烟012---It's a filthy, disgusting habit, and I want you to quit now!
