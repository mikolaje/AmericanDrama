Great.
Great. Just give me a sec to change film. Okay.
Okay. I know I'm not supposed to know,
but I do and I'm so excited for you.
What's going on?
Monica's pregnant.
Oh, my God. Is that why you guys had to get married?
Guys, I'm not pregnant.
Oh, slow swimmers?
What?! What do you mean? You're not pregnant?
You didn't tell anybody I was, did you?
No.
I'll be right back.
Why don't we get a shot of Monica and the bloody soldier.
About that, Joey, you have to change before the party.
I can't. I don't have any other clothes here.
Find some, please.
Anything that doesn't say, "I died tragically in France."
Why don't we see the bride and the groom, and the bridesmaids.
Hey, Mon, why'd you tell the guys that you weren't pregnant?
Because I'm not.
We found your tests. If you're not pregnant...
...it's because I am.
What are you talking about? Phoebe, what are you talking about?
Yes, I am with child.
I didn't want to say anything because it's your day.
I didn't wanna steal your thunder.
So you told people I was pregnant?
Does this look like a conversation I want to remember?
Who's the father? Yeah.
I can't say.
Why? Why not?
I can't say because he's famous.
Oh, my God. Who is it?
Phoebe, come on, you have to tell us.
Okay, okay, it's James Brolin.
James Brolin is the father of my baby.
As in Barbra Streisand's husband James Brolin?
What?!
Well, he never said that to me.
Friends S08E01 The One After I Do
Monica, if you step away,
we'll get Chandler and the bridesmaids. Okay.
How about just the bridesmaids?
You know, I am the groom. I was told it was a big deal.
It is. Yeah.
Oh, my God.
Thank you for that. I just can't deal with this just quite yet.
So instead you told me Monica was pregnant?
You said she was. I just didn't disagree with you.
Sneaky. Yeah.
Smile, ladies!
By the way, James Brolin? I know.
I could only think of two names:
Him and Ed Begley Jr. And then...
I remembered he's gay, so...
Ed Begley Jr. is not gay.
Really?
Thank you very much.
Ladies and gentlemen, it gives me great pleasure to introduce to you
for the very first time: Mr. And Mrs. Chandler Bing.
Before we go out there, I got a present for you.
Honey, I'm not gonna put my hand in your pocket.
No. I've been taking dancing lessons. What?
For the last six weeks.
I wanted this to be a moment you'd never forget.
That is so sweet.
So would you care to join me in our first dance as husband and wife?
Yes.
What's the matter?
It's these new shoes, they're all slippery.
Are you gonna be able to do this? Not well.
Well, the good news is, I don't think anyone's looking at us.
So are you ready to talk about it?
No.
Now?
No!
We'll talk about something else then. Thank you.
Who's the father?
Honey, I haven't told him yet...
...so, until I do, I don't think I should tell anybody else.
Yeah. That's fine. That's fair.
Is it Tag? Phoebe!
Okay, I'm sorry. I'll stop.
Is it Ross? It's Ross, isn't it?
Oh, my God, it's Joey! Stop it. Okay?
I am not gonna tell you until I tell him.
At least we know it's a him.
Oh, sweet Lord.
I'm sorry, okay? I went down to the gift shop.
It was either this or a bathrobe.
Look. What's more important: the way I'm dressed,
or being with you on your special day?
Honey, I'm not gonna even pretend I was listening. Hey! Hey!
I'm Ross, I don't believe we met.
I'm Monica's older brother.
Hi, I'm Mona from her restaurant.
Hello, Mona from her restaurant.
Mona. What a beautiful name.
You think so? I always kind of hated it.
Come on! Mona Lisa.
Mona...
...Llegglachen.
The famous botanist.
Oh, no, she's... Well, she's dead now, but...
Supposedly she was once quite the hottie of the plant world.
Really?
See, I never knew about her. Linda Llegglachen...
So, what table are you at?
Me too.
Good. Now there'll be someone there who likes my name.
Yes, there will.
Guess what, Molly Gilbert.
You've just been bumped up to table one.
And if it's all right with you,
I'll take your place at table six.
Martin Llegglachen.
That's better. Now, just bend your arms a little bit.
Now look straight ahead.
Okay, this time I want you to really put your ass into it.
Chandler, darling, look, my date has finally arrived.
I'd like you to meet Dennis Phillips.
Congratulations. Thank you.
Yes, Dennis is a dear old friend...
...and a fantastic lover.
Bravo, Dennis. Thanks for pleasing my mother so.
I'm so sorry I missed the ceremony. I was stuck at auditions.
Yes, Dennis is directing a new Broadway show.
I don't believe we've met. Joey Tribbiani.
Dennis Phillips.
I've admired your work for years.
You've done some really amazing stuff. Thank you.
If you'll excuse me, I'm gonna go get myself a drink.
I'll be back in a moment.
Dennis Phillips. That's great.
How did you guys meet?
Well, it's a funny story.
Funny, "haha"? Or funny:
Thank you. Thank you very much.
If everyone will please take your seats,
dinner will be served.
I thought you were at table six. No. Nine.
See, before, when you showed it to me, you held it that way...
...which was misleading.
Hello.
Will you see if your mom
can give my resume to Dennis Phillips?
If I could get in a Broadway show, then I would've done it all.
Film, television and theater.
The only thing left would be radio.
But that's just for ugly people.
What size shoes do you wear? 11, 11 half.
Great. My shoes give me a problem on the dance floor.
Can I borrow your boots from your costume?
I don't really even know where I left those. Sorry.
Those aren't 11 half.
Okay, fine, I'm a 7!
I have surprisingly small feet.
But the rest of me is good. I'll show you.
Can you believe Phoebe got pregnant?
You know what, honey? Let's not talk about that right now.
This is so huge.
Sure, but as big as your wedding?
Of course not. Nothing is.
Between me and you, in this day and age...
...how dumb do you have to be to get pregnant?
You know? Sometimes you can do everything right.
Everyone wears what they're supposed to wear...
...and one of those little guys just gets through.
How?
I don't know. Maybe they have tools.
Well, I talked to her, and she's definitely gonna have the baby.
She said she's gonna raise it on her own.
Well, maybe that's really brave.
Maybe. I just hope she realizes how hard it's gonna be.
Maybe she hasn't really thought it through that much.
Well, there's a lot to think about.
How is she gonna handle this financially?
How is she gonna juggle work?
Does she realize she's not gonna have a date again
for the next, like, 18 years?
I don't know.
Are you okay?
I'm just thinking about Phoebe. Poor, knockedup Phoebe.
Champagne?
Oh, yes! Thank you very much.
That's actually how the French drink it.
Well, I just got off the phone with my lover James Brolin.
Oh, really?
Yes. Apparently, he is married to some singer.
But he said he'd leave her for me.
And I said, "James, James Brolin, are you sure?"
James Brolin said...
Rachel's really the one who's pregnant?
What?!
Why bother?
How do you feel? I don't know. I don't know how I feel.
This is all happening so fast.
I have to make all these decisions that I don't wanna make.
Someone just take this away from me!
Calm down. Maybe you're not pregnant. What?!
When I got pregnant with the triplets,
I took that test, like, three times just to make sure.
Yes. Maybe it's a false positive.
Are you sure you peed on the stick right?
How many ways are there to do that?
I'm just saying, don't freak out until you're 100 percent sure.
All right, I'll take it again when I get home.
You gotta take it now.
Do it as a present to me.
Okay, thank you. Okay.
I'll run out and get you one.
You girls are so great.
Wait a minute. Who's the father?
She won't tell us.
Come on! It's my wedding.
That could be my present!
I just gave you peeing on a stick.
See, this is why you register.
It was the chair again. Okay? I'm not doing it!
It was... Look, you know what?
Would you like to dance? Sure.
Great.
Dr. Geller. I wasn't farting!
A little game from our table.
Yes? Dr. Geller, will you dance with me?
Maybe later. Right now, I'm about to dance with this lady.
Okay.
Unless this lady wouldn't mind letting you go first.
I'd be happy to. You are very sweet.
Yes, I am.
In fact, why don't we try my special way?
You can dance on my feet.
Sure. Yeah? Hop on.
Is the pretty lady looking? Uhhuh.
Keep dancing.
And the world will never know.
Did you talk to Dennis about me yet?
Yes. I told him how talented you were
and I told him all about Days of our Lives.
No, no, no! You don't tell a Broadway guy that!
Now he thinks I'm just a soap actor.
But you're not just a soap actor.
You are a soap actor with freakishly tiny feet.
Thank you. No, thank you, Miranda.
Melinda. All right.
How cute was that?
Oh, were you watching?
Can I go next?
Of course you can. Hop on.
Okay, but I get to hop on after her.
I am so gonna score. What?
I like your bow.
I'd like to propose a toast to Monica and Chandler...
...the greatest couple in the world,
and my best friends.
When I first found out they were getting married,
I was... I was a little angry.
I was like, "Why, God? Why?
How can you take them away from me!"
But then I thought back over all our memories together.
Some happy memories.
And there were some sad memories.
I'm sorry.
And some scared memories.
And then I realized I'll always be their friend.
Their friend who can speak in many dialects...
...and has training in stage combat
and is willing to do partial nudity.
To the happy couple.
Thank you. That was very nice, Ashley.
Can we do it again? No, no.
So, is it my turn now? I'm next.
That's okay, you can dance with her first.
Are you sure?
Okay.
Okay, so, what's your name? Gert.
That's pretty.
What are you doing there, Gert?
Dancing on your feet like the other girls did it.
Okay.
Hop on, Gert.
Why aren't you moving your feet?
I'm trying.
Faster. You're not going fast enough.
Maybe I should stand on your feet!
So did you happen to catch my toast up there?
Oh, my God. That was for my benefit?
There was a little something for everyone.
I know you're casting for this new show.
Look, Joey. I don't think you're right for this project.
See, that's where you're wrong.
Whatever it is, I can do it.
If you didn't see it up there, just try me.
It's an all Chinese cast.
Can you be Chinese?
Well, I'm not proud of this, but...
Oh, my God. No, no, no. Please don't!
Ready to get back to the dance floor?
Did it turn into sand?
Come on, I love this song. Come on. You'll be fine.
No. No, I won't.
Do you know why I took all those lessons?
For the first time, I didn't want you to be embarrassed
to be seen on the dance floor with some clumsy idiot.
Oh, sweetie, you could never embarrass me.
Okay, you could easily embarrass me.
But it doesn't matter, all right?
I married you.
So I'm gonna dance on my wedding night with my husband. Come on.
Just try not to move your feet at all.
There you go.
Chandler, I'm gonna have you arrested. Why?
You stole my moves!
How much longer? 30 seconds.
Thirty seconds, okay...
Did I miss it?
Rachel.
I want you to know that if it's positive, we're gonna...
I know. I know. You do. Okay.
It's time.
No!
Go ahead, Rach.
Wait. You know what? I can't look at it. I can't look at it.
Somebody else tell me. Somebody else tell me.
Okay.
It's negative.
What? It's negative.
Well, there you go.
That is... That's great. That is really great, great news.
You know, because the whole...
...not being ready and, kind of, the financial aspects, all that...
This is so just the way that this was supposed to be.
Then, great.
God, this is so stupid.
How can I be upset over something I never had?
It's negative?
No, it's positive.
What? It's not negative, it's positive.
Are you sure? Yeah, I lied before.
My god.
Now you know how you really feel about it.
That's a risky little game.
Are you really gonna do this?
Yeah.
I'm gonna have a baby.
I'm gonna have a baby.
I'm gonna have a baby!
With who? No, it's still not the time.
I just didn't see the fast song coming.
Don't try to talk, we'll get you up to your room, soak your feet.
You'll be okay.
Thank you. That is so sweet!
No, I mean it. There are so few genuinely nice guys out there.
Tell me about it.
I feel like I'm holding down the fort by myself.
It's Joey, right? Yeah.
Wait a minute! No!
I'm the nice one!
I'm the one that danced with the kids all night. I...
How small are your feet?!
Listen, you know what, sir, for the last time,
I don't care what the computer says.
We did not take a bag of Mashuga Nuts from the minibar.
And we did not watch Dr. DoMeALittle.
 Joey, were you in our room last night?  No.
I was told the name of the movie would not appear on the bill.
We're checking out of the bridal suite.
That's right, I'm no longer a bride.
I'll never be a bride again.
Now I'm just someone's wife.
And I'm the happiest guy in the world.
Come on. Honey, don't be upset.
 We still have so much to look forward to.  Yeah, right.
We got the honeymoon.
That's not till Thursday.
The wedding pictures.
It won't be ready for weeks.
Not the disposable cameras from the tables.
That's true. I knew I married you for a reason!
Tell you what, I will go get them developed, and you can go home.
Okay.
 What? What did you take a picture of?  Nothing.
It was something.
Ross has the cameras. Has he checked out yet?
Are you joking? Checkout is not till noon.
 And he has a good 11 minutes left.  So?
So Ross had never checked out of a room a minute before he had to.
One time, when we were dating, we got a late checkout.
He got so excited, it was the best sex we ever had.
Until he screamed out "Radisson" at the end.
Okay, well, I'm gonna get Ross, get the cameras
and get them developed.
32, Joe. You're 32!
 Here's a copy of your bill.  Thanks.
Champagne, strawberries...
Oh, my God!
I can't believe Chandler ordered porn on our wedding night.
Yeah, that's sad.
Mashuga Nut?
Friends S08E02 The One With The Red Sweater
Soaps, shampoos. Are you really taking all this stuff?
Why not? It's built into the price of the room.
Yeah, but you don't need... What is this?
Thread.
Score!
Where are the disposable cameras?
What disposable cameras?
The cameras. Remember last night I asked you to take them.
 No, you didn't.  Yes, remember?
Right before we cut the cake, I went up to you and I said...
Yeah, you asked me if I could do you a favor.
Then my Uncle Murray came up to you and handed you a check.
Then you said, "Why is it called a check?
Why not a Yugoslavian?"
Yeah, then you did that,
 So you don't have the cameras?  No, sorry, man.
So, what? They're gone? Monica's gonna freak!
I'm sure they're somewhere here in the hotel.
I'll help you look for that.
 Great.  In three minutes.
Are you gonna open the presents without Chandler?
No! I'm just...
They're calling out to me.
This little guy even crawled up in my lap.
Chandler wouldn't mind if I opened just one present.
What do you think it is?
A little mirror that, when you look into it...
...you see yourself as an old woman.
A tiny salt shaker!
Oh, my God, for tiny salt!
 Oh, wow! Okay. Well, that was fun.  Oh, yeah.
Okay, I'll just wait for Chandler
 to open up the rest of them.  Okay.
Although, you know, this is part of a saltandpepper set.
It may just count as only half a present. What do you think?
I guess it's okay to open one more
if it's part of a set. It's probably this one.
Or this one!
How are you feeling? Got any morning sickness?
The guys don't know yet, do they?
No, Joey and Ross don't know anything.
And Chandler still thinks Phoebe's pregnant.
That's right. Chandler does still think I'm pregnant.
He hasn't asked me how I'm feeling or offered to carry my bags.
I feel bad for the woman who ends up with him.
After you, of course.
Don't worry. I promise you only have to be pregnant for a few more hours
...because I'm telling the father today.
Is it someone in the building?
That tall guy on the first floor?
No!
What? I think he's cute.
Then you have his baby.
Believe me, I'm trying.
It's so weird. You're gonna tell this guy today...
...and he has no idea what's gonna happen.
Yeah. You're just gonna knock on his door
and change his life forever.
You're like Ed McMahon,
except without the big check.
Or the raw sexual magnetism.
Yeah, well, I guess it is pretty big news.
Pretty big? It's huge!
God, this guy doesn't have a clue.
He's just walking down the street thinking,
"I had sex with Rachel Greene. I rock!"
Then, bam! He's a father, everything's different.
It's only different if he wants it to be.
I'm not gonna ask him for anything.
Okay, then. He still has this huge decision to make.
Now he's walking around thinking,
"Do I want to be a dad?" Then, bam!
What was that "bam"?
I don't know. He's hit by a bus, or something.
Joey, what would you do if someone you slept with
told you she was pregnant?
Who called here?
Did she sound blond?
Did she have an accent? I gotta make a call.
Should have never walked into that Sunglass Hut!
Joey, Joey. It's not you! You didn't get anybody pregnant.
Why would you scare me like that?
What the hell's going on?
Is somebody pregnant?
Oh, yeah! That's me.
Oh, my God, Pheebs! You're gonna have a baby?
Yes, I am. Oh, my God, I'm gonna have a baby!
Wait a minute, who's the father?
You don't know him. It's not important.
He wants nothing to do with me or the baby.
Who is this guy? Who is he?
Because I will track him down and kick his ass!
 David Linn.  David Linn!
David Linn. David Linn!
Who's David Linn?
Some guy from my gym. Little annoying.
 Chandler?  Did you find the cameras?
 No. Did you?  Yes.
That's why I'm under the table, celebrating.
I checked in the lost and found. I talked to the manager.
No one's turned them in.
This is great. Those cameras were the only thing
that was gonna cheer Monica up today. She's really depressed.
You guys just got married. Why is she so depressed?
All my energy is going into not asking that question.
I can't believe I screwed this up!
I'm sorry, man.
Here's a thought. This is the same ballroom.
There's a band. There's gonna be plenty of dressedup people.
Are you suggesting we dance our troubles away?
No, no, no, I'm saying we buy more of these at the gift shop...
...throw our tuxes back on and take a few pictures.
All we have to make sure not to get anybody's faces.
Are you serious?
I'm just thinking about your new bride at home, okay?
Do you want to start your life together by letting her down?
Marriage advice? Really?
I'm telling you, this looks exactly like your wedding.
Aren't these the same flowers?
I don't know. Monica picked out the flowers.
 What about the chairs?  She picked out those too.
 How about the place settings?  That was her.
 What did you do?  I was in charge of the cameras.
Gift shop?
 Did you do it yet?  Not yet.
Then what are you doing here? Are you about to do it?
 Is it Gunther?  No.
Phoebe, it's not Gunther!
Thank God. Because that hair on a baby?
Phoebe, the father is not here, okay?
I haven't told him yet. I don't think I can tell him at all now.
 Why not?  I don't konw. Let me think.
I was walking down the street, thinking,
"I'm gonna tell the father." And then, bam!
Bus?
No, you! Phoebe, you freaked me out.
You kept saying how huge this all is.
But it is huge.
I know. But I was just thinking about how huge it was for me.
I didn't even go to how huge it'll be for the father.
You're thinking about this way too much.
Just tell him and get it over with.
It's like ripping off this BandAid, quick and painless. Watch.
Oh, mother of...!
See?
Are we opening presents?
No. I shouldn't have even opened these.
Joey, I am out of control!
Joey, you have to do me a favor.
No matter what I say, no matter what I do...
...please, do not let me open another present. Okay?
Okay.
 Give me one more.  Okay.
Oh, good, you're here. Pheebs? Listen...
 Sit down, I got something I wanna say.  All right.
It's a scary world out there,
especially for a single mom.
I've always felt that you and I have a special bond.
So...
Phoebe Buffay, will you marry me?
Oh, my God!
 Joey.  Oh, yeah, I'll marry you.
You can't marry him!
Hey, lady, your day's over. It's my turn.
 Phoebe.  Why can't she marry me?
I can and I will.
She's not pregnant.
It's Rachel. Rachel's the one who's pregnant, okay?
Oh, my God!
Phoebe, I think he'd notice when you didn't have a baby
in nine months!
It's Joey!
I love you.
Wait, I can't believe it! Rachel's pregnant?
Who's the father?
We don't know.
I wonder if it's that dude.
 There's a dude?  Yeah.
Who is it?
About a month ago this guy spent the night with Rachel.
I didn't see who it was, but...
Was that story over?
The guy left this.
Oh, my God! I know who the father is.
People have got to finish their stories.
Excuse me, could you take a picture of us?
Of course.
Would you take one of us?
Yeah, sure.
Click.
 It didn't click.  I heard it. I heard it.
But there was no flash.
Why won't you take our picture?
Oh, yeah. I'll take your picture.
Your finger was covering the lens.
Who are you, Ansel Adams? Get out of here! 
Look, I feel really bad about how I freaked you out before...
...so I called the father and asked the father to meet you here
so you could tell him. Go!
What? Wait a minute.
Phoebe, how do you even know who the father is?
I may play the fool at times...
but I'm more than a pretty blond girl with an ass that won't quit.
I believe this belongs to the father of your baby...
Oh, God.
He's in there right now?
You can turn around, or you can go rip the BandAid off.
What do you want to do?
 Let's rip.  Are you sure?
 Phoebe!  Okay. Sorry.
Hey, Rach.
Why don't you go up onstage.
 I'll get a picture of you doing the speech.  Okay, okay.
Will the owner of a 1995 Buick LeSabre
please see the front desk? Your car is about to be towed.
That's my car!
 A '95 LeSabre?  Yes.
 A green LeSabre?  Yes!
I'm sorry, I meant a blue LeSabre.
Yes, greenblue.
Well, go. Go move it!
Okay. Ready for the last picture?
 Yeah.  Get ready to run.
Congratulations on your wedding.
So, what's this about?
Rachel has something she wants to tell you.
And I believe that this is your red sweater.
No, this is my red sweater.
Oh, no.
Could I get anyone a coffee?
Or poison? No? Just for me? Okay.
What's going on, Rach?
Nothing. Phoebe kind of made a mistake.
But you do wear that sweater a lot.
Are you involved in some kind of dare?
I'm actually glad Phoebe called.
I know we broke up because you thought I was immature enough,
but I've really grown up.
I think we should get back together.
It's just not the right time.
 It is the right time.  Okay.
I'm ready for more.
 Tag.  Come on, Rach. Let's give it another try.
I'm having a baby.
 You can go.  Thank you.
I don't know how any of these got opened!
You opened them all?
I know, I know I am a terrible person.
Chandler's never gonna trust me with anything ever again.
You got my parents' gift.
Yeah. What is that?
I don't know. I think it does something to salami.
 How'd it go?  What did Tag say?
Tag is not the father. And Joey knows now?
I do, Rach, I do. And I am so happy for you.
Wow, you didn't even try to unook my bra.
So are you ever gonna tell whoever it is?
I will. I'm just not up for it tonight.
Rach, no matter what this guy says,
I want you to know you're not gonna be alone in this.
 I'm not?  No. Listen, I...
It's a scary world out there,
especially for a single mom.
I've always felt like you and I have this special bond, you know?
 Rachel Greene, will you marry me?  What?
 What?  What?!
 Pheebs, give me the ring back.  No!
No, Joey, you're so sweet, you're so, so sweet, honey.
But I'm not looking for a husband.
I understand.
Well, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go and lie down.
I can't say that didn't hurt.
But I'll take you back, Joey Tribbiani.
Yeah, Pheebs. Listen, about that, I only offered...
 Ooh, a Salami Buddy!  There you go!
 We're back!  Great.
We're hanging in the kitchen. Let's stay in the kitchen.
 It's picture time.  You're gonna love these.
Here's a picture of Ross.
And that's me.
And that's me and Ross.
And here's a picture of our first kiss as a married couple.
Wow, that is a great picture. Yeah!
And interesting, because I found the cameras
in one of our bags.
Didn't see that coming.
Okay. So this isn't a picture of our first kiss...
...but it is a picture of my first kiss with this lady.
Which, by the look on your face,
I'm sure you'll remember, so there's no need...
How about I'll take the real pictures to get developed right now.
 That'd be a good idea.  Okay.
You opened all the presents without me?
I thought we were supposed to do that together.
You kissed another woman?!
 Call it even?  Okay.
I'm gonna go get these in some water.
You stole those from these people's wedding?
No, I took them from the hotel lobby.
They think they can charge me for some dirty movie...
...and a bag of Mashuga Nuts, they got another thing coming!
Hey, my sweater!
I've been looking for this for, like a month.
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
 Hey, how you doing?  Good. Long time no see.
 Like your sweater.  Right back at you.
It's crazy about Rachel.
Well, she's one crazy lady.
So whose is it?
I don't know, some Italian guy.
Come on, read your own label.
See you later. He is so weird.
Hey, babe.
Aren't you excited we're going on our honeymoon?
Yeah, I am.
Bermuda, Bahama, come on pretty mama.
That's right, get it out of your system while we're alone.
Hey. We came to say goodbye.
Yeah. Have a great honeymoon.
 Thanks.  I better go pack.
No, I already packed.
The only thing I couldn't find, though, was your Speedo.
Speedo? I don't have a Speedo.
I'm gonna go pack my regular, long bathing suit.
Good, you're still here!
I wanted to tell you to have a good honeymoon.
Thank you!
And I also wanted you guys to know that
I am telling the father today.
What? What? What?
We know it's Ross.
How? How do you know?
It was his sweater. But, oh, my God!
I so wanted Ross to know first.
But I am so relieved that you guys know!
That is so great.
 And I'm gonna be your baby's aunt!  I know.
Me too!
And I'm gonna be an uncle! Come here.
You're all gonna be aunts and uncles.
Yeah, but I'm the only one related by blood.
Great! So now that you all know, you can help me.
Give me some advice on how to I'm gonna tell Ross.
What were you gonna say?
I was gonna tell him that I'm gonna have the baby,
and he can be as involved as he wants.
Well, that sounds good.
Yeah, but, you know, how do I start?
I mean, what's the first thing that I say?
Okay, great. Thanks.
 Hey, good luck.  Yeah, bye.
Hey, what was that all about?
Well, I guess there's no harm in telling you now.
Rachel and Ross are going to have a baby.
What?!
I didn't even know that...!Why didn't you tell me?
Why am I talking like this?
I didn't think you could keep it a secret.
What?!
I am an excellent secretkeeper.
I have kept all our secrets.
 What secrets?  No, no, Joey.
I'm not gonna tell you, because I am an excellent secretkeeper.
 You'll tell me later?  You already know.
Friends S08E03 The One Where Rachel Tells…
It's so romantic to send people off on their honeymoon.
You know, Monica and Chandler are married.
Ross and Rachel are having a baby.
Maybe you and I should do something.
All in good time, my love. All in good time.
Shoot! I left my guitar in their apartment.
Well, you can let me in later, right?
No, I don't have a key.
They took mine to give to you.
What? They took mine to give to you.
Why would they take away our keys?
Maybe they don't trust us.
That's not it. They let me keep my key
the last time they were out of town.
You mean the time you broke the ketchup bottle
and cleaned it with Monica's guest towels?
 Hey, I washed those.  No, you didn't.
Yeah, that didn't sound like me.
What am I gonna do? I really need my guitar.
I have stuff in there too.
 What stuff?  Monica's chicken parm.
I'll take care of it.
Hey, Mr. Treeger? It's Joey Tribbiani.
Listen, I need to get into Monica and Chandler's apartment.
It's an emergency!
Gas leak. Oh, and bring garlic bread.
 Did Rachel find you?  No, why?
She was looking for you.
Well, I guess I'll catch up with her later.
She really wanted to talk to you now.
Yeah, it seemed pretty important.
Oh, no.
What?
I think I might know what this is about.
Really?
Yeah.
We promised we weren't gonna tell anybody this, but...
About a month ago, Rachel and I slept together.
And?
Wow, I thought you'd be a little more shocked.
Oh, sorry. And?!
Well, we said we'd just do it that one time...
...but now I think she may wanna start things up again.
Yeah, I don't think that's what it is.
Why? What else could it be?
Oh, wow, I don't feel well.
I'm telling you, I'm telling you, that's what it is.
No wonder she was looking at me all funny during the wedding.
She didn't say anything to you?
 Maybe it's something you ate.  Could be, yeah.
 Please, just go and talk to Rachel.  Yeah, I guess I should.
Man, you know what I have to realize?
Maybe I'm not the type of guy women can have just one night with.
You know, they always seem to want a little bit more.
I should remember that.
Next.
They're kissing. Let's just go around them.
Honey, leave them alone. They're in love.
I'm in love too. But in an orderly fashion.
Next.
Hi. Can you do that and walk?
Because she said, "Next."
Sorry, we didn't hear you.
We're on our honeymoon.
Let me see what I can do.
There are some firstclass seats available.
Did you hear that?
They bumped them up to first class
because they're on their honeymoon!
Come on. Let's act like we're on our honeymoon.
We are on our honeymoon.
Grab my ass.
 Next.  Hi. Sorry, I almost didn't hear you,
because, you know, I'm just so in love with my new husband.
We're on our honeymoon.
 Congratulations.  Thanks.
Okay, Mr. Bing, you'll be in 25J,
and Mrs. Bing, you're in 25K.
We're on our honeymoon,
so can you do your little thing and bump us to first class?
I'm sorry, all the firstclass seats are taken.
That couple got the last two.
See? If we'd gone around them like I said,
she'd have given us those tickets! Damn it!
25J and K, any chance those aren't together?
I still can't believe they took away my key.
I mean, you trust me with yours.
Of course I do! And I'm gonna get it back to you just as soon as
they're done with it at the keyshining place.
 What the hell is that?  I don't know.
Treeger, what are you doing?
You said there was a gas leak in here.
Why not use your key?
Because by the time I found it on this thing,
the whole place might have exploded.
If that happens at another building I manage,
people will ask questions.
Come on, hurry up!
Well, we could have done that.
Look at that! They're going into the firstclass lounge.
 Do you know what they have in there?  No.
Me neither. We have to get in!
 Just act like you belong.  Oh, my God! Oranges!
Nice to see you again.
Sir, may I see your tickets, please?
Yes, of course.
I'm sorry. Would you move your thumb?
I can't see the seat number.
That's all right. I have it memorized. It's 1 A.
Sir, this isn't a firstclass ticket. I'm sorry.
Apology accepted. Excuse us.
Sir, I'm afraid I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.
Fine.
Go, go, go!
I think there's something that we really need to talk about.
I think we do. Why don't we go inside.
 Look, I know why you're here.  You do?
Yeah, and to save you from any embarrassment...
...I think maybe I should talk first.
 Okay.  Okay?
Ross and Rachel.
Rachel and Ross.
That's been one heck of a seesaw, hasn't it?
What?
I mean, look, that one night
we had was fun and certainly passionate.
But don't you think it's better if we just stay friends?
Seriously, what?
Okay, okay. You know what?
If you want to, we can do it one more time.
I mean, I'd be okay with that.
In fact, I have some time right now...
Okay.
You know what? Can I talk now?
 Oh, sure.  Okay.
I'm pregnant.
Ross?
Ross?
Okay, whenever you're ready.
And you're the father, by the way. But you got...
 Can I get you some water?  I'm good. I'm good.
Ross, there is no pressure on you, okay?
I mean, you can be as involved as you want.
Yeah, I...
I'm just, I don't know. I don't understand...
...how this happened.
 We used a condom.  I know.
But you know, condoms only work, like, 97 percent of the time.
What?
What?!
Well, they should put that on the box!
 They do.  No, they don't!
Well, they should put it in huge block letters!
Ross, let's just forget about the condoms.
Well, I may as well have!
Listen, you know what? I was really freaked out too...
...when I found out.  Freaked...?Hey, I'm not freaked out.
I'm indignant as a consumer!
You know what? Let's talk later.
No, I wanna talk now.
In fact, I wanna talk...
...to the president of the condom company.
Okay, you know what? Maybe I should come back... Okay.
Yeah, I'll press one!
I looked everywhere. There's no gas leak.
So then I can heat this up?
Anyway, I'll get moving on that new door.
Great. Listen, could you do us a favor
and not tell Chandler and Monica about this?
Because, you know, they don't have any kids of their own...
...and this door was like a child to them.
Well, I'm gonna have to put on a new lock.
They'll find out anyway.
Oh, no.
It's looking like an allday job.
I'm gonna have to cancel my yoga class.
Hey, Ross. Could you tell Jasmine
 I can't make it to yoga class today?  Sure.
 Namaste.  Namaste.
Oh, my God! What happened to the door?
So it's noticeable, huh?
Look, is Rachel here? I need to talk to her.
Didn't you two already talk?
Yeah, but...
Okay. Look, you guys know that Rachel and I slept together...
...but there's something else.
Rachel's pregnant.
 Holy mother of God!  Oh, my God, I can't believe that!
 With my child.  That is brandnew information!
 You already know, don't you?  Little bit.
 How you doing?  Okay. I mean, I'll be okay.
It's just, I don't think I handled it very well.
 What'd you say to her?  Nothing.
But the complaint department at the condom company got an earful.
 Then when I turned around, she was gone.  Oh, Ross.
I know. But in my defense,
I just found out that condoms are only, like, 97% effective.
 What?  I gotta go find her.
Hey. Hold on! Are you serious?
So, like, 3 percent of the time, they don't even work?
They should put that on the box!
 Evidently, they do.  What?!
I can't believe we're here.
 You've gotta be kidding.  What?
As a wedding gift to you,
the hotel would like to give you the honeymoon suite.
No! You have been screwing us all day!
 Who are you?  We're you.
Just 10 seconds later!
You already got the firstclass tickets, you got the lounge.
We should get free stuff too!
You're not the only ones on your honeymoon!
You can have the suite if you want.
We don't care about where we stay.
We're here to celebrate our love for each other.
We don't have to get free stuff.
We just want to be together.
We need the stuff.
Monica, it's Joey. Listen.
Phoebe and I smell gas coming from your apartment.
What? Are you serious? Joey smells gas.
What else is new?
We'd check it out, but you took our keys.
Well, do something. Get in there!
How? I guess I could break down your door.
Yeah, do that.
 And you won't blame us for any damage?  No.
Are you doing it? I don't hear anything. Come on.
Okay, I'll break it down.
Hi. He's doing it, he's breaking down the door.
Okay, we're in.
Okay, Rachel, are you comfortable?
If I said I was, would you judge me?
The doctor'll be here in a minute to do your sonogram.
Okay.
Oh, man, I swear, if they sold these at Pottery Barn...
We need to talk.
Right now? Because I kind of got an alfresco situation going on over here.
Please, I really...
I want to apologize for the way I acted earlier today.
Okay, Ross. That's fine. Can you stay up near my head?
What? Oh, yeah, sorry.
I think I went a little crazy. I was thinking about myself
when I should've been thinking about you...
 Okay, head, Ross! Head, Ross!  Right.
I want you to know that
I'm gonna be there through this whole thing. Okay?
The doctor's appointments, the Lamaze classes,
babyproofing the apartment.
Although, we can worry about that after we get married.
 Married?  Well, yeah, I think we should get married.
Because that's your answer to everything?
No. Because that's the right thing to do.
Yeah, maybe, if you're in love.
But Ross, we are not in love, are we?
No. But still, I mean, you can't possibly do this alone.
Excuse me?
Come on, Rach. You can't even eat alone in a restaurant.
 What?  I'm just saying if you can't eat by yourself,
how do you expect to have a baby by yourself?
I can too eat by myself!
When have you ever?
When certain people leave the table
and I am not finished!
Well, certain other people take two hours to eat a bowl of soup!
Oh, please. You inale your food.
I grew up with Monica.
If you didn't eat fast, you didn't eat!
Am I interrupting?
No, Dr. Long. Please come in.
This is Ross. He is the father.
But not the husband, because, evidently, she can do this alone.
Nice to meet you. I'll get started on this.
I don't know why you can't admit you need me?
I do need you. I need you to stay near my head!
Okay. Everything looks good.
Here it is on the screen.
Here's your uterus...
...and right here is your baby.
Oh, my God.
There it is. I see it.
Congratulations. I'll give you two a minute.
 Okay.  Thank you.
Pretty amazing, huh?
I don't see it!
 What? What?  I can't see it.
But you just said that you did.
I know. I lied.
I didn't want her to think I was a terrible mother.
I can't even see my own baby!
Oh, sure. Come here. Sure, you can.
Come here. Look, it's right there.
Oh, it's beautiful.
I see it now.
 Do you really?  No, I don't see it!
Okay. Come on. All right. Okay.
You see this tiny thing that looks like a peanut?
Yeah.
Sweetie, that's it.
That's it?
Well, I saw that.
 Thank you.  You're welcome.
Wow, I can't believe that's our baby.
Yeah, that's our baby.
So how was the doctor?
Everything went great.
 Good.  Hey, show them the picture of your uterus.
I don't see the baby. Where is it?
Oh, no, I know. I couldn't see it either at first.
But it's right...
Ross, I lost it again.
Wait. Before we go in, I just want you to know that
I love you.
I had a great time on our honeymoon.
I can't wait to spend the rest of our life together.
You're sticking with the shell necklace, huh?
You're back!
Come on in!
How was the honeymoon?
So much fun. But the best part is,
we met this great couple on the flight back.
That was the best part?
Good honeymooning, tiger.
They're really cool. They were on their honeymoon too.
They're terrific.They live here in the city.
Can we go call them? Is it too soon to call?
I wanna call.
I'm sorry. We're just kind of excited.
We finally have a couple to hang out with.
A couple? Like two people?
Like one, two people?
This is different. Greg and Jenny are in a relationship.
Greg and Jenny?
"Hi, Greg. I'm Chandler. This is Monica"
"Hi, Monica. This is Jenny."
"Hi, Jenny. Hi, Greg."
 They're great. If you just got a chance...  You know what?
Why don't you just give us our souvenirs and get out of here.
 We didn't get a chance to...  You've gotta to be kidding me!
We didn't get anything for anyone.
Yeah. Nice necklace.
That you can have.
Friends S08E04 The One With The Videotape
Hello.
 Welcome home.  How was the honeymoon?
Great! How about you? You're having a baby!
 Look, I have a sonogram picture.  Good.
Ross, it's got your wavy, black lines.
Now that Ross knows, can you tell us how'd it happen?
When did it happen? How many times does it happen?
Monica, that's not right.
Start with where.
It happened about six weeks ago.
I just got home from work and Ross was already there.
Guess he'd been hanging out with Joey.
You're welcome, buddy.
Yeah, thanks.
I had a lot of work to do, and Ross, nice guy that he is,
offered to help me out.
And then we had a little wine, we got to talking.
And next thing you know, out of nowhere, Ross comes on to me.
That's a little misleading.
 What is?  The lie you just told.
 That you came on to me?  There's the one!
But you did. Let's be honest.
Yes, let's.
It's not important.
What's important is, we're having a baby,
and it doesn't matter who came on to who.
"Whom."
That's right.
You know you kissed me first.
What? You were begging to kiss you!
You were sending me signals all over the place!
 I was sending signals?  Yeah.
Please. Okay. Anyone in this room think
that I'd actually send Ross begging signals?
Please, show of hands.
You know, it doesn't matter what people believe!
What matters is what happened.
Okay, so these signals, Ross, explain this to me,
'cause maybe I need to be more careful.
Am I sending these signals right now?
You know what? You know what? Rachel, just drop it.
No, please. Show me how I begged you.
I can show you! I have it on videotape.
It's an expression.
I can't believe he taped the two of them having sex.
Yeah. You gotta tell a girl before you tape her.
Such a rookie mistake.
You know who has a great camera?
Greg and Jenny?
Do you still want to call them?
 I want to call them.  Let's call them.
Ask them if they brought their friends souvenirs.
Hello. 8th Street Deli?
Hang up. You get food poisoning just talking to that place.
 Sorry, wrong number.  Here you go, babe.
Hello? It's the deli again!
All right, I'll have a sandwich.
I don't think this number's right.
 What?  You got fakenumbered.
 What? People don't do that.  Oh, I think we do.
They gave us a fake number?
 Why would they do that?  I don't know.
You were a delight to talk to.
You asked all those insightful, great questions.
And you've never been funnier. I mean, joke, joke, joke!
You were a hoot!
Don't worry about it. You still got me and Phoebe.
Excuse me, I don't want Greg and Jenny's rejects.
Rachel won't talk to me. She won't open the door.
I wonder why, pervert.
Okay, listen, I am not a pervert.
That's, like, the pervert motto.
Raise your right hand, put your left hand down your pants
and repeat that.
Filming Rachel was not something I planned.
Okay, look. Here's what happened. Joey can back me up on this.
A month and a half ago, remember I came to you with a problem?
The personal thing?
 What personal thing?  About sex?
That I hadn't had sex in months?
Yeah, I knew what you were talking about.
Do you have a minute?
I'd like to talk about something I'm uncomfortable talking about.
Sure.
How about you showering with your mom?
I actually had a topic in mind.
I'm kind of going through a dry spell,
sexwise.
 For, like, months?  Five, to be...
...lying. Six.
Six months? That's rough.
It's not all bad.
I'm learning to appreciate the small things in life, like...
...the sound of a bird and the color of the sky.
The sky's blue, Ross. And I had sex yesterday.
Please help me. I have a date tonight.
It has to go well. I'm scared for my health.
Okay, okay.
I got something. It's this story that I came up with.
Very romantic. I swear any woman that hears it is putty.
 Really? Tell it to me.  Okay.
Now, you're gonna want to have sex with me when you hear it.
Remember, it is just the story.
I'll try to control myself.
Okay.
Years ago, I was backpacking across Western Europe...
You were backpacking across Western Europe?
Have a nice six more months, Ross.
Okay, okay. I'm sorry. Please, please.
You were in Western Europe, and...?
I was just outside Barcelona,
hiking in the foothills of Mount Tibidabo.
I was at the end of this path,
and I came to a clearing and there was a lake.
Very secluded. There were tall trees all around.
It was dead silent. Gorgeous.
And across the lake I saw
a beautiful  woman bathing herself.
But she was crying.
Why?
This is great wine.
It's from France.
In Europe.
Western Europe.
You know, a few years ago
I was backpacking across Western Europe.
 Really?  Wait, it gets better.
Yeah, I was in Barcelona.
I studied for a year in Barcelona.
So anyway, I was hiking...
 I love hiking!  That's great!
I was hiking along the foothills of Mount Tibidaybo...
I think it's "Tibidabo."
Okay, do you want to tell the story?
What are you doing here? How'd your date go?
Great. I'm across the street having sex right now.
Your story sucks.
Look, if it didn't work, it's because you didn't tell it right.
 Show me how you did it.  No, I don't want to.
How long since you seen a girl naked?
I was backpacking across Western Europe...
I'm not feeling it.
I was outside Barcelona, hiking...
No, Ross, I'm not hot. Are you hot?
It's been six months. I'm always hot.
You're not selling the story. You don't believe it.
I gotta go, I got a date. But try this.
Do what I do when I'm preparing for an audition.
No. I'll set you up with my video camera
and you could record yourself and see what you're doing wrong.
I'll try that.
Alright, now, you're all set up. You're good to go.
 Just hit record.  Good luck. Thanks.
Hey, Jo, listen. If you ever have any problem with the ladies,
you know I'll help you out.
That means a lot to me, man.
Hello.
Can I get you anything? Lens cleaner?
Your battery okay?
Ross, thank God you're here. You have to help me.
Were you talking to yourself?
That's less embarrassing. Yes. Yes, I was.
So when she came in, I got distracted
and totally forgot about the camera.
It kept rolling and recorded everything.
Yeah, we're gonna need to see that tape.
What a great idea! That'll get Rachel to forgive me.
You know what? It's not fair to her. Let's forget the tape.
Thank you.
 No.  You're right.
 Joey, no.  Loud and clear.
I still don't get why Greg and Jenny
would give us a fake number.
You know, if they knew what they were doing,
they probably didn't give you real names, either.
Maybe people give out fake numbers,
but they don't give out fake names.
Oh, yeah? Hi. Ken Adams. Nice to meet you.
Regina Phalange.
 I just don't get it. We didn't do anything wrong.  I know.
Although you did tell an awful lot of jokes.
You said they were funny. Joke, joke, joke!
Joke, joke...
Or maybe it was your questions.
What about my questions?
The sheer volume.
It was like flying with the Riddler.
 I'm soory. Was that another joke?  Was that another question?
Is Ross still here?
No, Rach, he's gone, but, listen, he told us what happened.
It does sound like an honest mistake.
Really? How would you like it if I had sex with you
and I taped it?
Oh, forget it.
There he is, the father of my child,
the porn king of the West Village.
Look, it was an accident, okay?
I feel bad that happened, but I swear, I didn't even watch it.
Anyway, here.
I thought you might be more comfortable destroying it yourself.
Thank you.
What?
 You don't want to see this, do you?  Hell, yeah!
I am not gonna show you this.
Not the sex part.
Just the stuff leading up to it.
Forget it. She's destroying it.
Okay, fine, fine. We'll think of another way
to put the "who came on to who" thing to rest.
Come on now, think!
Forget it, Phoebe, okay? It's Rachel's tape,
and she can do whatever she wants with it.
And she wants to destroy it, so end of story.
 I want to see it.  What?
Clearly, you don't want people to see this tape.
I don't want people to see this tape, either.
But you so badly don't want us to see it
that it makes me want to see it. Do you see?
Are we watching the tape or not?
I don't want people to see it for your sake.
I don't believe you.
I think you don't want them to see you begging me.
 Rachel, please?  Oh, a little preview.
Fine. Fine. But I want the record to show
that I tried to take the high road.
Because in about five minutes, I'm gonna be saying...
Okay, here we go.
Hello. Can I get you anything?
I'm so happy.
Thank God you're here, Ross. Help me.
Were you talking to yourself?
 There I am.  You're gonna get pregnant.
I screwed up so bad.
I told Monica that I'd send
all those wedding invitations weeks ago.
You didn't do it?
I put them in my desk at work, and forgot about them until today.
Sweetie, it's okay.
Everybody made it to the wedding. I'm fine.
 Kind of hurting my hand though.  I know.
I can't believe I did this,
especially after Monica went on and on and on about it.
"Okay, Rachel. Here are the invitations, Rachel. Be very careful, Rachel.
Please, drinking no liquids around the invitations, Rachel."
Did you do it on our invitations?
Not on the ones we sent out.
So just the ones you gave back to us and we had framed?
Can you believe it's already happening?
It seems like yesterday they just got engaged.
I know.
Remember that night they got engaged?
How you and I almost...
Oh, I remember how we almost.
You think we would've gone through with it?
If we haven't gotten caught.
You think we would have done it?
I know I wanted to. I just wasn't sure if you wanted to.
Oh, I wanted to.
So we both wanted to.
Interesting.
Anyway,
it probably worked out for the best.
Yeah, sure.
In about 10 seconds, he kisses me.
In about 5 seconds, you'll see why.
Ross, did I ever tell you about the time
that I went backpacked through Western Europe?
Get ready to see some begging.
Oh, you came on to Ross!
What?
Now I'm so happy.
 What are you talking about?  You used the Europe story!
That's the magic story you use when you want to have sex!
How do you know about that story?
How do you know about that story?
My friend Irene heard it from some guy.
Some guy!
No, she told me that his name was Ken Adams.
Ken Adams!
So, people are familiar with the Europe story?
Yeah. Listen. About that, the "who came on to who" thing
really doesn't matter.
I mean, it would have happened either way.
If you had't initiated it, I know I would have.
It was an amazing night.
It was. It was an amazing night.
You think it looked amazing?
I don't know.
I mean, I honestly didn't watch it.
Yeah, me neither.
Yet.
That may be weird.
Yeah, it would be really weird.
 Good luck.  Good luck to you.
 Mind if I mute?  Oh, please.
There go the clothes.
You are undressing awfully quickly.
Six months, Rachel. Six months.
 We look pretty good.  I was gonna say.
 Nice tan.  Thank you.
I'd just gone to the beach that weekend.
Have you been working out?
I have been working out.
This is so much better than I ever...
Oh, that's not pretty.
 Make it stop. Make it stop.  Oh, no!
Hello, Greg?
Hi, this is Monica from the plane.
Listen, the number that you gave me, 853...
That is their old number.
Jenny's been giving it out since they moved!
Jenny! That is so Jenny!
Listen. How would you like to get together next Saturday?
Okay, how about Sunday?
Okay, the week after that?
The week after that?
You know what, Greg?
We are good, interesting,
funny people with good questions.
And if you and your precious Jenny can't see that, then...
January 15?
We'll see you then! Okay.
This one's rare. This one's mediumwell. Go, go, go!
Hey, Phoebe! How was dinner?!
Dinner was good! Just saying hi! Now I'm gonna go!
Well, hello there.
I didn't see this on the menu.
Tim, this is Phoebe.
Phoebe, this is Tim, my new sous chef.
 So you're Monica's boss?  No, she's my boss.
"Sous" is French for "under."
I "sousstand."
Tim, I need a calamari and a caesar salad.
And could you get me the pesto?
 You made pesto?  Yes, I did.
Would you say your pesto is the besto?
I don't know. I would say it's pretty goodo.
I still need the calamari and salad.
I like your necklace.
 I made it myself.  You are so talented.
Well, it's no pesto.
Alright, alright. Let's just cut to the chase.
Okay. You're single. You're single.
He gets off work at 11. She'll be waiting for your call.
I'll give him your number if I could just get
one calamari and one caesar salad!
I did not yell. I am not putting a dollar in the jar.
Friends S08E05 The One With Rachel's Date
Wow, Bing! Burning the midnight oil.
You know me, sir.
I do have a question for you.
Do you know how I can get around the office computer network...
...so I can access the really good Internet porn?
You're a joker, Bing.
What's funny about that?
Sorry I kept you waiting so long.
That's okay. Where do you wanna go?
I think you know where I wanna go.
 The Hard Rock Cafe?  Yeah.
 Again?  Yeah.
I'm telling you, I like the food.
You like the Purple Rain display.
 Hey, Bob.  Hey, Toby. Have a good night.
Did that guy just call you Toby?
Yeah, he thinks that's my name.
Why don't you correct him?
It's been going on way too long now.
The first time he said it, we were just passing each other in the hallway,
so I didn't say anything.
The next time he said, "Hey, Toby, want a doughnut?"
I wanted the doughnut.
Five years later, the doughnut's gone and I'm still Toby.
Five years. Chandler, you have to tell him.
No. That would be so awkward.
Besides, we don't work together. He's on the sixth floor.
So he calls me Toby once in a while. What's the big deal?
It could be worse. It's not like he's calling me Muriel.
Muriel. Why would he call you Muriel?
Oh, my God.
Chandler "M." Bing.
It's not just an "M." Your middle name is Muriel!
It is a family name.
Chandler Muriel Bing.
Your parents never even gave you a chance, did they?
Drake, I've discovered the reason for your memory loss.
What is it?
Apparently your brain transplant was not entirely successful.
It seems your body's rejecting Jessica's brain.
Is it serious?
Not if we extract tissue from the original body...
...and synthesize antibodies and introduce them to your system
which could stop you from rejecting the brain.
That sounds simple enough. Let's just do that.
We would,
but when we went to exhume Jessica's body...
...it was gone.
Cut.
Very nice, people.
Okay, let me just get changed and we can go to dinner.
What happened to Jessica's body?
I'm not telling you. You'll have to see it on TV.
 You don't know, do you?  No. couldn't care less.
 Good scene, man.  You too.
What? You weren't in it.
Kash, this is my friend Rachel.
Rachel, Kash. Kash, Rachel.
Why haven't I seen you here before?
Joey just thinks I'll embarrass him.
He thinks I'm a soap opera nut.
Which I'm not. I'm not.
Although, I do know
your favorite ice cream flavor is butter pecan.
And your dog's name is Wally.
 Look, I'm just stroking your arm.  Here we go. Here we go.
 Bye, Kash.  Bye.
Say hi to Wally.
Monica.
Oh, my god. I had the best time with Tim last night.
He is so sweet.
I can't wait to get "sousneath" him.
 I have to fire him.  Why?
He's terrible. He's slow. He burns things.
Last night he lit my pastry chef on fire.
Maybe he was just nervous. You can be intimidating.
Besides,  I've met your pastry chef,
and she can stand to be taken down a peg or two.
Well, now she has no eyebrows. Mission accomplished.
But, Monica, he loves his job so much.
Can't you just give him another chance, please?
All right. But if he lights someone else on fire, he's out of there.
That's fair. Thank you so much. Thanks.
Oops. Looks like when he got the pastry chef,
he got you a little bit too.
I paid to have this done.
Love it!
Hey. You know, Kash really liked you the other day.
He said he thought you were charming.
 I thought I was a complete idiot.  I'm with you.
He even asked me if I thought you'd go out with him.
I think I'm gonna throw up a little.
 What did you say?  I said, "No."
What?
What? I just figured since you're pregnant,
you're not gonna be seeing people.
Okay, Joey.
First of all, Kash Ford? Not people.
Second of all, what did he say when you told him I was pregnant?
I didn't tell him. I didn't know if you're telling people.
This back when I thought Kash was still "people."
Good, good. Don't tell him. Don't tell him.
Just have him call me, okay?
Rach, look. I really don't think that's such a great...
Okay. You go do it or I'll come back to that set.
I'll meet more actors. I'll meet them all.
 Hey, Bob.  How's my pal Toby doing today?
If I see him, I'll ask.
Was that Bob from six you were just talking to?
 Yeah.  Then you know each other?
We're on a semifirstname basis.
 What do you think of adding him to our team?  Bob?
Working here with us? Every day?
Yeah. I don't know if he has what it takes.
Really? They love him down on six.
But this is 11.
It's almost twice as hard up here.
Okay, I hear you loud and clear.
 Bob will stay put.  I think it's best, sir.
But we really do need to find someone up here.
Work is starting to pile up.
I've got a stack of documents on my desk this high.
You know what we should do. Just toss them in the shredder
and claim you never got them.
That's a good one, Bing.
What does a guy have to do to be taken seriously around here?
Okay, I gave him another chance, but Tim has got to go.
 But...  No, no, no. He is totally incompetent.
I called the chef who recommended him to me.
He said, "Ha, ha! Gotcha!"
 Okay, okay. But you can't fire him today.  Why not?
Because I'm dumping him today.
What? You said he was so sweet.
He is sweet. He's too sweet.
He calls me all the time.
"Did you get home from work okay?
Did you get out of the shower okay?"
 Just don't pick up your phone.  Then he comes over!
"I was so worried about you." Be a man!
So now I'm not allowed to fire him?
We can't fire him and dump him on the same day.
He'll kill himself.
Okay, well then, I'll fire him today,
and you go out with him another week.
Are you kidding? Another week with that simp,
I'll kill myself.
Okay, then we'll both do it today and he'll just have to deal with it.
Okay. But the question is who's gonna go first?
Whoever goes second is the bitch.
 What do you mean?   Come on, fire a guy that's just been dumped?
Bitch! And dump a guy that's just been fired?
Blond bitch!
I wanted to do this days ago, so I think I should go first.
All right, that makes sense.
But screw you! I'm going first!
 Toby, you got a sec?  Sure. What's up?
I just had a meeting.
I was actually hoping to get transferred up here,
but I just found out it's not gonna happen.
Apparently somebody thinks I'm not "11 thfloor material."
Say, who the hell is this Chandler?
What do you think is a better excuse
for why I'm not drinking on this date tonight?
"I'm a recovering alcoholic," "I'm a Mormon"...
...or "I got so hammered last night I'm still a little drunk"?
So, what do you want to do tonight?
There’s a Ukrainian film at the Angelica
that's supposed to be very powerful. Interested?
No. No.
But I'll go see a normalperson movie with you.
Rach, you wanna come?
Oh, no. I can't. I've got a date.
 A date?  Yeah. Why, is that weird for you?
Why, no. It's the opposite of weird. It's regular.
It's mundane. It's actually a little dull.
It's no Ukrainian film.
Earrings!
A date? She's got a date? With who?
I set her up with this actor on my show.
 You set her up?  No.
Joey, what were you thinking?
I was thinking that it would probably be okay...
because Ross hasn’t gone out with Rachel in five years!
Joey, I'm not worried about her! I'm worried about my baby.
Whoever she dates, my baby dates.
Where is this "actor" taking them?
Hey! I'm an "actor" too.
I'm not sure. I think they're taking the ferry
out to some Italian place on Staten Island.
A ferry? My baby's going on a ferry?
Do you have any idea how dangerous those are?
Are we talking about one of those big boats
that carry cars that go like five miles an hour?
Why not just jump out of an airplane. Thatthat's a fun date!
or burn each other with matches? That's fun, too.
 Hey, Joey.  Hey, Kash. This is Ross. Ross, this is Kash.
Hey, I hear you're going on a ferry tonight.
Bit of a daredevil, are we?
Do you guys think this is too slutty? Hi, Kash.
Hey, Rachel. You ready to go?
 Yeah. See you guys later.  Okay.
 Have a great time, you guys.  Thank you.
And yes, it is too slutty!
I'm so glad you called.
I feel like it's always me calling you.
So, what's up? Is everything okay with Phoebe?
It will be in a minute. Listen.
Tim, you're a really great guy.
That's because I'm with you.
It's just, I'm in a place in my life right now where...
So sorry. "This just in."
Oh, it's 911 from the restaurant, that means Monica needs me right away.
No, she doesn't! I know what that is.
You can stay.
I'll miss you too, Pheebs.
And I will be holding you right here.
So, what movie do you wanna see?
And not one I have to read, okay?
I get that from books.
 Books?  Alright, car magazines, cereal boxes...
...but it's enough!
I tell you what. Why don't we just stay here?
Let's not see a movie, we'll just and hang.
Just wait for Rachel to come back from her date?
Hey, if that's what you wanna do, I'm not gonna say no.
Dude, what is going on?
 I have to find out how it went.  Why?
This guy could be my baby's stepfather.
They go on one date and you're worried about them getting married?!
He's not you!
I just... I can't believe she's dating!
Ross, what did you think she was gonna do?
I don't know.
I guess I just can't believe any of this is happening.
What do you mean?
It's just I always thought when I had another kid,
it'd be different.
I love Ben.
But every time  I drop him off at Carol and Susan's...
...it breaks my heart a little.
I've always had this picture of me and my next wife in bed on Sunday,
my kid comes running in, leaps up on the bed
and we all read the paper together, you know?
Maybe fight over the science section.
That's a nice picture. You can still have that.
No. No, I can't. Rachel's out with some guy.
My baby went with her.
If anything, that picture keeps moving further away.
Hey, can I ask you something?
In this picture of you and your wife,
is your wife Rachel?
It used to be.
Now she doesn't really have a face.
Smokin body, though.
Good call. But the face, Ross, the face isn't Rachel.
No. But how much easier would it be if it were?
Yeah, I know, but I don't think that's not what she wants.
No, it's not what I want either.
I mean II can't force myself to fall in love with her again now.
Okay, Ross, maybe you need a new picture, okay?
It won't be what you thought.
But no matter what...
...there's gonna be a brandnew little baby. Your baby.
Who cares what the picture looks like?
Yeah.
I tell you what. Let's you and me go out and have some fun.
Whatever you want. Come on.
We can catch that Ukrainian film.
No, I said fun.
 Hey, Toby?  Hey, Bobby.
It's Bob, actually.
You work up here. Can you tell me where this Chandler Bing's office is?
Yeah, it's right...
Right there. Let me ask you, why?
I wanna talk to that bastard,
See what his problem is.
Okay, Bob. Listen.
I'm the reason you didn't get the job up here.
 Toby, don't.  Bob.
Toby, I'm not gonna let you cover for him.
Anything you say will just get me more upset with Chandler.
That puts me in a difficult position.
I got your page. Is everything okay?
That depends.
How are you and Phoebe?
Oh it's great! It's great! Thank you so much for introducing us!
My pleasure.
Okay, I'm afraid I've got some bad news.
 Phoebe!  Monica!
 You're fired!  I'm breaking up with you!
What?
I'm breaking up with you.
 You're fired.  Why?
I'm sorry. I'm not ready for a relationship right now.
I'm sorry too. But I like things done a certain way.
The chemistry's just not right.
Oh that's good, the chemistry thing for us too.
Wow. Okay.
I realize I came on a little strong,
but it's because I think you're so amazing.
I just wanna tell you how much
I appreciate you giving me an opportunity here.
because you're the most talented chef I've ever worked for.
Anyway...
 Tim, wait.  Yeah?
I think I spoke too quickly. There's a learning curve with this job.
And maybe we could try it again.
 Really?  Yeah.
 Thank you so much. I know I can be better.  Okay.
And, Tim, I just want to say good luck here.
 Hello.  Hi.
How was the date?
I'm alone and I just bought $ 15 wonth of candy bars.
What do you think?
What happened?
I made the mistake of telling him I was pregnant.
 He didn't take it so well?  Well, better than you.
But still not what you want.
Yeah. He got all weird and sputtery.
Then he said: "I hear those hemorrhoids are a bitch."
 He sounds swell.  Doesn't he?
 You want a little cheering up?  Yeah.
 Sit down.  Okay.
Guess whose middle name is Muriel.
Chandler M. Bing. Oh, my God.
 I'm sorry about your date.  It's all right.
I guess I'm just done with the whole dating thing.
Just one more thing in my life that's suddenly completely different.
 This is hard.  Yeah, I know.
On the other hand,
in about seven months you're gonna have something...
...that you're gonna love
more than any guy you've ever gone out with.
Just wait.
Wait until the first time your baby grabs your finger.
You have no idea.
Thanks, sweetie.
You wanna grab some coffee?
No. I'm gonna go eat 10 candy bars.
I thought I cheered you up.
 You did. There are 20 in here.  Right.
 Good night.  Good night.
 Ross?  Yeah?
Hey, it's Mona. From the wedding.
How are you?
I'm good, except you owe me a dance.
That's right.
Well, would you be interested in seeing a Ukrainian film?
Oh, you're serious. Sure.
Great. Well...
I think I need one more cup of coffee.
 Sure, let me get it for you.  Okay.
Bob?
Bob!
Bob!
What the hell are you doing?
I just find out this is Chandler's office.
Come on, Toby. Give me a hand!
 Guys, guess what?  What?
I know it's last minute, but we decided to have a Halloween party.
 Good!  Great!
 And everybody has to wear costumes.  I can't make it.
Come on, it'll be fun.
I'll be there.
I have to wear a costume to my classes that day anyway.
Tell me you're not gonna dress like a dinosaur.
Not two years in a row.
I'll come to the party, but I'm not dressing up.
You have to.
No way. Halloween is so stupid.
Dressing up, pretending to be someone you're not.
You're an actor.
Ross, are you gonna bring Mona?
Yeah, I think I will.
 The hot girl from their wedding?  Yeah.
If she needs any ideas for costumes,
she could be a bikini model...
...or a slutty nurse, or a sexy cheerleader.
Or Leatherface from Texas Chainsaw Massacre.
No, no, no! Slutty Leatherface.
Now, wasn't Joey hitting on her at the wedding too?
That's right, he was hitting on her.
And I got her. I guess the better man won.
Please don't take her from me.
Friends S08E06 The One With The Halloween Party
Ursula!
Wait. It's me, Phoebe.
I thought there was a mirror there. Okay. Bye.
Wait a second!
So, what's new with you?
Nothing. I'm getting married next week.
What?
It'll be a small ceremony. Just family.
His.
Okay.
I'm really happy for you.
Wait. If you want to come,
I guess that'd be okay.
 Really?  Sure.
You could be my sister for the day.
Yeah, okay.
My friends are having a Halloween party tonight
at my old apartment, so you could come.
Maybe I could meet the guy you're marrying.
Well, I'm supposed to work at the restaurant tonight.
I'm supposed to be working now, so who cares!
 By the way, it's a costume party.  So that's why you're...
No.
But thanks.
 You're supposed to wear a costume.  I am.
I am a woman who spent a lot of money
on a dress she wants to wear...
...because soon she won't fit into it.
I'm Catwoman,
who wants to borrow the dress when you're too big for it.
Okay.
Trick or treat!
Can I give out the candy?
I really want to be with the kids right now.
You know, ever since I got pregnant
II have the strongest maternal instincts.
 Trick or treat!  Just a minute!
Look at you guys!
 Wow! You are a very scary witch.  Thank you.
 And you are a very funny clown.  Thank you.
And you...
...are so in style right now.
I work at Ralph Lauren.
The whole fall line has got this equestrian theme going on.
I don't suppose you saw the cover of British Vogue, but...?
Could I just have the candy?
Yeah.
Sure.
Catwoman. So we meet again.
So we do, Supergirl.
It's me, Phoebe.
Monica, can I talk to you for a second?
Listen, I appreciate you getting me the costume...
You did this to him?
What? I thought he'd love it.
His favorite kid's book was the Velveteen Rabbit!
The Velveteen Rabbit was brown and white!
Well, it was either a pink bunny or no bunny at all.
No bunny at all. Always no bunny at all!
You didn't dress up either?
Yes, I did. I'm Chandler.
Dude, what happened?
 How is that me?  Okay.
I'm Chandler.
That is so you!
When have I ever done that?
When have I ever done that?
Trick or treat.
 You're the prettiest ballerina I've ever seen.  Thank you.
That deserves another piece of candy.
Thank you.
I have to say, that earns "twotwo" pieces of candy.
I love you!
Honey, here, take it all.
Monica? We need more candy.
 What? There's only been four kids.  I know.
But one said she loved me, so I gave her everything.
No wonder you're pregnant.
What are you supposed to be?
Remember the Russian satellite, Sputnik?
Well, I'm a potato. Or a "spud"...
...and these are my antenna.
So Sputnik becomes...?
Spudnik! Spudnik!
Wow! I don't have the worst costume anymore.
All right! Ross came as doodie.
No, I'm not doodie.
No, spacedoodie.
Hey, sweetie.
 Aren't you gonna give me a kiss?  Okay, I will.
But right after, you have to tell me who you are.
 Ursula?  Ursula's fiance?
 Oh, my god. You're the sister.  Yeah.
Okay, I just slapped my future sisterinlaw's ass.
 Yeah.  I'm an idiot.
Uh, is your mother here? Maybe I can give her a little slap on the butt.
 My mother killed herself.  See, and I knew that.
Now I'm sweating.
Look at me, I'm really sweating.
Now I'm saying, "Look at me," I'm getting even sweatier.
I think I probably should go.
No. That's okay. We'll start over.
 Hi, I'm Phoebe.  Eric.
Why are you looking at me like that?
'Cause the sweat's getting in my eyes and its burning.
 Thank you.  There.
 So, what are you?  I don't think they have a name for it.
I get nervous, and I sweat like crazy.
 No, I meant your costume.  I'm a solar system.
Yeah, my students helped me make it. I teach the second grade.
 I love the second grade.  Really?
Yeah! It's so much better than first grade
when you don't know what's going on
and definitely better than third grade.
With all the politics and the mind games.
 So, what do you do?  I'm a masseuse, by day.
 You don't have to stand here with me.  I'm having fun.
I'm excited for you and Ursula.
I feel very lucky. She's great.
I think she's the most beautiful woman I've ever seen.
Thank you.
 Hey, Joey?  Yeah?
 You read comic books, right?  Exclusively.
Who do you think would win in a fight, Catwoman or Supergirl?
 Catwoman, hands down.  Yeah.
Between you and Phoebe ? I'd give the edge to Phoebe.
 What? Really?  You kidding?
Phoebe lived on the street, okay?
Plus, she's got a crazy temper.
She's not right behind me, is she?
No, you're fine.
 Could I take Rachel?  I'm not sure.
What? Come on, I am tough!
Punch me right here, as hard as you can!
Will you relax?! What are you taking this so seriously for?
 It doesn't matter.  Really?
What if I told you Ross or Chandler could beat you up?
I would say, "Woman, please."
Ursula's fiance is really sweet.
He's a teacher, he does all this volunteer work.
Normally, I don't like sweaty guys.
But I could just mop him up.
 Oh, my God, Phoebe?  What?
You're getting a crush on your sister's fiance.
No, I'm not, you are!
Here comes the temper.
Trick or treat.
You know what, honey? We're actually out of candy right now.
But someone just went to get some.
And I've been giving out money, but I'm out of that too.
 Can I write you a check?  Okay.
Okay. What's your name?
Lelani Mayolanofavich.
Okay, I'm just gonna write this out to "cash."
Hi, Mona.
Joey's gonna be thrilled.
He was hoping you'd be a slutty nurse.
Actually, I'm just a nurse.
You'd think that would embarrass me,
but you see, I'm maxed out.
 You made it.  Wait.
 You're a potato?  Well, I'm a spud...?
 And the antenna... You're Spudnik!  Yes!
Marry her.
Okay. Here's a good one for you.
Who do think would win in a fight between Ross and Chandler?
I can't answer that. Chandler's my husband.
 So Ross?  Yeah.
 Hey, beautiful.  Hello, handsome.
Oh, God.
Look at you two. When did you guys meet?
 Two weeks ago.  Two weeks? That's it?
Yeah, I know. It sounds crazy, and I'm not impulsive, but...
She's just so perfect and we have so much in common.
Oh, really?
We're both teachers.
And we were both in the Peace Corps. 
Peace Corps, really?
In fact, when we were building in Uruguay,
we were two towns apart and we never met.
Yeah. It wasn't a town when I got there,
but it was a town when I left.
 Shall we get me really drunk?  Sure.
Howdy, doodie.
That's funny, yeah.
You're the funniest man here
in a bunny costume his wife made him wear.
Relax, man. Relax. You're looking a little flushed.
I think we might find out the answer to our question.
What question?
Monica and I were talking about
who could kick whose ass in a fight, you or Ross?
 There's no question.  So you think Ross too?
 You picked Ross?  Ross is really strong.
He's the strongest out of all three of you. Except for Joey.
I can't believe you didn't pick me.
In her defense, she's right. I am stronger.
I would destroy you.
Really? You think you're stronger?
Why don't you prove it?
I'll prove it. I'll prove it like a theorem!
All right! Stop it!
Stop it!
Stop! No one's gonna fight in this apartment.
Monica, people came to see a fight,
let's give them one what they came for!
You guys could armwrestle.
Yeah, listen to the slutty nurse.
You're going down.
Oh, yeah? You're going further down, downtown!
Seriously, guys, the trash talk is embarrassing.
Gunther, you brought candy.
Thank you so much for picking this up.
 You are so sweet.  Really?
Honey, someday you are gonna make some man
the luckiest guy in the world.
 Got to go.  Trick or treat.
Hi! Wow! There you go.
My friend Lewis told me you were giving out money.
We were, but now we've got candy.
I'd rather have the money.
That's not your choice. Happy Halloween!
This isn't fair.
Is it fair that all you did was put on a cape
and I gotta give you free stuff?
Shut up!
You shut up!
 You can't tell me to shut up.  I think I just did.
And here it comes again. Shut up!
 Rach.  No, I got it. I'm good. I got it.
Wait a minute, I had one more thing to say to you.
Right. Shut up.
You're a mean old woman.
Wait! Shut... Don't cry!
Let me get my checkbook!
Look, honey. You don't have to do this, okay?
It's the strength you have inside that means the most to me.
You're loyal, and you're honest and you have integrity.
That's the kind of strength I want in a man that I love.
That means nothing to me. Come on!
Hi, liar.
You know, the only reason he's marrying you
is because he thinks the things you were saying were true.
 They could be true.  But they're not.
Yeah. It's a fine line.
 Why are you lying to him?  I don't know.
He said he did all these stuff, I said I did it too.
and he got so excited, it was really fun.
Honey?
It's a filthy, disgusting habit, and I want you to quit now!
She's helped so many people quit smoking.
We'd really better get going.
 Right. You have a church group meeting tonight.  Right.
 It was nice meeting you.  You too.
And, Ursula, it was really nice meeting you tonight!
Pheebs, come on! Bunny versus doodie. We're waiting!
Okay, guys. One match, winner take all.
Wait. What does the winner get?
 Pride.  And dignity.
Okay, if you say so.
All right, ready, set, go!
 Come on!  Come on!
Wow, they're both really strong.
Or equally weak.
Oh, God. Chandler's making his sex face.
So you getting tired?
No. I could do this all day.
Yeah. Me too.
 Getting a little tired, though.  God, I'm exhausted.
This is starting to look really bad for me, okay?
Mona's standing right over there.
God, she's talking to Joey! You gotta let me win!
No way! If anything you've gotta let me win!
My wife thinks I'm a wimp!
At least you have a wife.
I keep getting divorces and knocking people up.
And I'm dressed as doodie.
You're Spudnik.
Come on, who we kidding ? I'm doodie.
Please? She's watching.
 Fine.  Thanks.
 Oh, no.  Oh, yeah!
My hero!
You're a weird lady.
Ursula said she left her purse.
What a relief. It has all the numbers for her prayer chain.
I'm sure it does.
Guess I'll see you at the wedding.
Listen, I don't think I'm gonna make it to the wedding.
So I just want to wish you all the luck in the world.
I think we'll be okay.
It's so perfect, and she's been saving herself for me.
Okay, I can't let you do this. She's lying to you.
What?
She is lying. And I bet I could prove it. Excuse me.
Okay. Yeah, not a prayer chain.
But what looks like a detailed drawing of a bank floor plan.
Okay, here's the name tag from where she works as a waitress.
Not a teacher, a waitress.
All right, here's her driver license,
this oughta be good, she always lies about this.
 How old did she say she was?  She told me she was 25.
I almost don't want to show you this.
Just remember, I'm a minute younger.
I am so stupid.
Of course she was lying!
She's not a teacher. There's not such a thing
as the top secret elementary school for the children of spies.
No, you're not stupid.
I'm not smart.
I just wanted so much to be impulsive for once.
To be romantic.
That's good. You should be impulsive and you should be romantic.
Just... you did it with the wrong person.
 What?  It's weird, two people look so much alike.
And so different.
Eric! Let's go!
 Better go deal with it.  Yeah, you should.
Hurry up! I gotta pray!
Well, I had to give the kid 50 bucks to stop crying.
That's not so bad.
No, I also had to go to a couple houses with him as his girlfriend.
I am just awful with children.
Come on. You're good with kids.
They're just crazy on Halloween.
They're all greedy, hopped up on sugar.
 Really? That's all it is?  Absolutely.
Halloween is the worst.
Except for Christmas. And their birthdays.
Kinda get a little crazy during the summer too.
And any time they're hungry or sleepy.
Kids are tough. Good luck with that.
Look, I wanted to tell I'mI'm sorry you lost.
Listen, I've got a secret for ya. I let him win.
Was that a secret, or a lie?
 No, I let him... Ross?  Yeah?
Would you tell her I let you win, please?
Yeah. Chandler "let me win."
No, Chandler's really strong.
My arm is so sore. Oh, nurse?
I am strong. I'll show you.
Chandler, please.
What's the matter? Are you scared?
Let's go, big bunny!
One, two, three. Go!
I'm gonna kill myself!
Oh, my God, you cleaned!
Look at these floors! You did the windows!
I have been begging you for months! And you did, you cleaned.
And nagging works!
No, I didn't actually do this.
Oh, no. Was I cleaning in my sleep again?
No, it wasn't you.
 Well, then, who?  I got a maid. Yay!
I hope by "maid" you mean "mistress"
because if some other woman was cleaning...
Now, honey, I know you don't like to relinquish control.
"Relinquish" is just a fancy word for "lose."
She's really nice, okay?
And she mentioned that she adored the way you arranged the sponges.
Did she really say that?
Yes, I distinctly remember because I thought it was a joke.
Now, just give her a chance, okay?
Fine, I can do it.
What's the matter?
Usually when I'm this anxious, I clean.
Friends S08E07 The One With The Stain
Whose cell phone is that? It's just so annoying.
Everywhere you go.
I think it's coming from your bag.
I never get calls!
Hello?
Hi, it's Eric, from the Halloween party.
Ursula's fiance.
Oh, my God, Eric, hi!
Wait, how'd you get this number?
I have a friend who's a cop, and he got it for me.
Wow. What an incredible violation and wonderful surprise!
Listen, I just... I thought you should know
I broke up with Ursula.
Oh, you did? He did it, he did it!
 What did he do?  I'm talking!
Anyway, I was wondering
if you were the sort of person who eats lunch?
Are you asking me out?
Because it'd be kind of weird
since you just broke up with my sister.
Yeah, okay. I'm sorry.
 Bye.  No, no. Wait!
I was just saying that so you'd think I was a good person.
Fight for me.
I won't take "no" for an answer.
Not great, but we can work on it at lunch.
I can be at your apartment in two hours.
Great. How do you know where I live?
I've got friends too.
 Okay, bye.  Bye.
Oh, my God, I'm going out with Eric!
This day is really gonna be so much better
than I thought it was gonna be.
Oh, Ross, I can't make lunch.
So apparently I'm available for lunch.
I can't. I'm busy. I'm apartment hunting.
You're moving?
I can't live with Joey once the baby comes.
I don't want my child's first words to be,
"How you doing?"
So does Joey know you're moving?
I haven't discussed it with him, but I know he'll be relieved.
Last week, he brought this girl over,
and I talked to her about morning sickness.
Then I showed her pictures from my pregnancy book.
 That's not really porn?  Not so much.
You know what? If you're looking for a place,
I just heard in the elevator this morning
that a woman in my building died.
Oh, my God. Was she old?
Does she have a view?
I don't know, but how great would that be?
You living in my building?
I could take care of the baby, I could come over whenever I want...
...with your permission.
That really would be great. Well, can we see it?
Maybe we shouldn't.
I mean, if she just died this morning out of respect.
Yeah. No. No, you're right.
 Shall we?  Yeah.
Yes?
Hi. I'm Ross Geller. I live in the building.
And I'm Rachel, an admirer of the building.
I heard about Mrs. Verhoeven passing away,
and I am so sorry for your loss.
 She didn't pass away.  What?
My mother's still alive.
Oh, thank God!
It looked like we were gonna lose her this morning,
but she's a tough old bird.
Are you close with her?
Of course. She and I would talk all the time...
...in the laundry room.
You speak Dutch?
I'm very honored to meet a friend of my mother.
You know, I would, but it's just too painful.
So she's really not dead.
No. She's hanging in there.
Could you tell me, is she hanging in in a onebedroom or a two?
Mrs. Bing, this tile cleaner is incredible.
Where did you get it?
Oh, well... I make it myself.
It's two parts ammonia and one part lemon juice.
The secret ingredient is...
You know what? We just met.
Okay. I'm gonna go get the clothes from the laundry room now.
When I come back, I'll clean behind the refrigerator.
I love her.
I'll be back in a minute.
Okay.
See? I told you.
She stole my jeans!
What?
I've been looking for them all week, and she is wearing them.
So she stole your pants
and then came back and wore them in front of you?
Don't you see? It's the perfect crime!
She must have been planning this for years!
I'll prove it to you, okay.
About a week ago I was wearing those jeans
and I dropped a pen in my lap,
and it left an ink stain on the crotch.
When she comes back,
I will find it and show you that stain!
Honey, isn't it possible the company that sold the jeans
made more than just the one pair?
I guess.
So should't we give her the benefit of the doubt
before we go snooping around her crotch?
Fine. I'm just glad I didn't give her my secret ingredient.
Out of curiosity, what is your secret ingredient?
Yeah.
Come in. I'm so glad you're here.
Yeah. Me too.
Not in the shaky, angry way that you are, though.
Sorry. I just saw Ursula.
I had to get the engagement ring back.
Just seeing her brought it all back.
All the lies, the way she used me.
I just...
I get so angry, just looking at her...
 Face.  Yeah. Yeah.
I'm sorry. It's just, when I look at you...
...I see her.
And when I see her,
I get a little bit angry.
 Maybe this is too weird.  Wait.
There's only a problem when I look at you.
I got it. I got it.
No, don't tear out your eyes!
I was just gonna take out my lenses.
Oh, yeah. Try that.
So is that better?
Not really.
You're blurry, but you still look like Ursula.
You're "Blursula."
Okay, wait. Maybe...
If I just don't look at you for a while.
See? It works. I'm not angry at all anymore.
This is a great date!
Look, Eric, turn around.
I like you, but it shouldn't be this hard.
This is our first date.
First dates are supposed to be about excitement and electricity and...
..."He just touched my hand, did he mean to touch my hand"
and you know first kisses...
Second kisses.
Thanks for the coffee, or:
bedankt voor de koffie, Gunter.
You speak Dutch? That's cool.
Do you have relatives there?
Yeah, we're done.
Ezel.
Ezel. Ezel.
Hey, Ross. Listen.
You wanna go see that new IMAX movie on tide pools?
 Really?  No.
But I got Knicks tickets for you, me and Chandler.
Sweet!
All right, well finish your coffee, let's go.
Okay. I have to stop by my place first.
To tape the game? You do this every time, Ross.
You're not gonna be on TV!
No, I have to see if this apartment became available.
You're switching apartments?
It's not for me, it's for Rachel.
Rachel has an apartment.
Yeah, but when the baby comes, she's gonna wanna move.
 She is?  Yeah.
You didn't expect her to live there with the baby, did you?
I guess I didn't really think about it.
Ezel.
Hey, Gunther, you're an ezel.
You have sex with donkeys.
Damn it!
 Nice jeans.  Oh, thanks.
 I like your top.  Oh. You're not getting it.
 What happened?  Oh. I fell asleep!
I was thinking about taking my lunch break.
Will you do the top of the cabinets?
That'll work up your appetite for lunch.
All right.
Hello.
What's going on?
I'm sorry. I've never had a maid before.
Is this not okay?
How was the game?
It was okay. I ate way too much.
I was talking to Ross, and he said you were looking for a new place.
Yeah. Hopefully across the street.
If certain Dutch people would just let go.
I was kind of hoping you'd stay.
Joey, I have to go. There's no room for a baby here.
No room? It's a baby. It's, like, this big.
You could put it over here.
Or we could put it right here. It's cute, right?
Or put it over here. You wouldn't even notice it.
"Where's the baby?" "Oh, it's right over..."
Honey, it's not just a matter of where you put it.
A baby changes everything.
They cry all the time.
Imagine bringing home some girl
and trying to score with a screaming baby around.
I could use a challenge. It's getting pretty easy.
It's so sweet that you want me to stay,
but I can't do that to you.
It would disrupt your entire life.
It's just...
I love living with you so much.
 I wish things didn't have to change.  I know.
You know, I blame Ross for this.
I do too, a little bit.
I'm gonna miss you.
You're the hottest roommate I ever had.
Oh, no, I have to go. I have a massage appointment.
No, stay here. We'll keep doing this.
I'll pay you.
No, I've gotten in trouble for that before.
 I'll see you later?  Absolutely.
I love the way you kiss.
Really? That's the thing I'm worst at!
You'll see.
 Hey. I think Brenda needs a raise.  How come?
Because I put my head between her legs.
 To see her pants?  They're my pants!
Are you sure? Did you see the stain?
No. I was getting into position, and then everything went dark.
She is not stealing from us, okay. Will you let this go?
Fine.
 She's wearing my bra!  Oh, dear God!
My pink, flowered bra! I recognize the strap!
Yet you don't recognize that you're crazy?
Here's the plan.
I'm going to leave, and you're gonna look at Brenda's bra.
Here's another plan.
No.
I would do it, but she thinks I'm attracted to her.
Why?
Did you not hear where my head was?
Come on, come on. We're a team. We're in this together.
I fear a jury will see it the same way.
Do this for me.
I catch you looking at womers breasts all the time.
You see that?
Do you see this?
All right, yes. Okay. I get your point.
But if it's not your bra,
will you just let the woman clean the apartment?
Yes. Absolutely.
You'll know it's mine because on the right cup,
the lacey part, there's a very noticeable rip.
You need new clothes.
 Hi. How is she?  It's not looking good.
Well, I brought her some bloemen.
That's so sweet. Would you like to come in and say goodbye?
I'm sure it would mean a lot to her.
Oh, I don't know that it would.
 Well, her memory is pretty much gone.  All right, then.
Welcome back.
Shall we pick up from where we left off?
I don't know. I'm still tired from this afternoon.
 Why?  The sex.
 What sex?  Our sex.
We didn't have sex.
If I didn't have sex with you,
I had sex with somebody that looked an awful lot like...
Oh, no. Oh, no.
No, no, no.
 You had sex with Ursula?  A little bit.
She walked in, I thought she was you and I kissed her and...
You didn't notice different clothes?
I was just so excited to see you.
You know what? This is too weird.
No, it's not. I don't wanna lose you.
It's like I was saying to Ursula
when I was making love to her and I thought she was you...
Yeah. It's too weird.
So I guess this is it.
Yeah.
Maybe it's for the best.
 You smell just like her.  Yeah, so do you.
 What are you doing?  I'm leaning.
This is where I lean.
Okay.
 Brenda, a bee!  What?
Yes! It's flown into your blouse,
and you better undo your buttons lest it sting you.
 I think I know what's going on here.  You do?
Look, I know it must be hard that your wife is a lesbian...
...but it's wrong. You're married.
 I totally understand.  Okay, good.
Could I just see your bra?
 Where'd you get those jeans?  You gave them to me.
 No, I didn't!  All right, I took them.
I figured it'd be okay
because you've got a big ink stain on the crotch.
Oh, no! Did you take my bra too?
What bra?
The pink one with the flowers.
You mean the one you're wearing?
I quit!
Sounds about right.
What is this?
This is just to give you an idea.
We can put screens here so that the baby has privacy...
...and maybe a mobile over the crib...
...and here's a baby monitor
which, till the baby comes, we can use as walkietalkies.
You're so sweet!
Oh, my God! And you gave the baby Hugsy!
That's really just to show where the baby would go.
Why don't I hold on to him so there's no confusion.
Joey, the baby is gonna be crying. It's gonna be loud.
 I'm loud.  It's gonna be up all night.
 I'm up all night.  It's gonna poop.
Hello!
What about all the women you wanna bring home?
Look. If I'm bringing home a woman
who can't stand being around a baby...
...then maybe I don't wanna be with that woman.
Or maybe we'll do it in the bathroom of the club!
Joey, are you sure?
Yeah. Look, I know sometimes it'll be hard, okay...
...but it'll also be really, really great.
Please, Rachel, I really want you to stay.
I want me to stay too. Thank you.
Joey, look at this crib. It's so cute.
I know. I found it on the street.
Are you...? Really? This is in such good condition.
Yeah.
Whoa! What's under the cover?
 I don't know.  It's moving.
It's got a tail! Get it out of here!
Okay!
Well, the old lady died. And how do I know?
Because her dying wish was for one last kiss.
But I don't care,
because you got the apartment. Yes!
Yeah.
I think I'm gonna stay here.
Isn't that great?
What...? You... But... Bu...
Ezels.
Hey, Pheebs. I'm having dinner with my dad tomorrow night.
Do you wanna come?
Sure, yeah. He's kind of sexy.
Oh, no, I'll be there too.
Okay. So we'll come up with some kind of signal.
If it's going well, you can take off.
No, I just need you there for support.
I haven't told him that I'm pregnant yet.
Oh. Why not?
Because I know he's gonna flip out,
and I hate it when he's angry.
Rachel, this is all so "Papa Don't Preach." 
No, Phoebe, wait. He's a scary guy.
I mean, one time he caught me smoking.
He said if he ever saw me doing that again,
he'd make me eat the entire pack.
Wow. Well, I will be there.
Gosh, I'm not gonna let that man make you eat your baby!
Hey, who is that guy? I think I know him.
 No, you don't.  No, you don't.
Oh, my God!
Monica, he's the stripper from your bachelorette party!
Her what?
Your secret bachelorette party.
You had a bachelorette party?
She untied his Gstring with her teeth.
Somebody stop me!
I thought we weren't having bachelor, bachelorette parties.
We agreed that it's a silly tradition.
It's a grand tradition!
I'm sorry. They surprised me.
There was nothing I could do.
Well, you could've untied it with your hands.
This is so unfair.
The one thing I wanted was to throw my best friend a bachelor party...
...but I wasn't allowed to.
All we got was a stupid steak dinner.
You went home with the waitress.
Yeah, that was a pretty good night.
I can't believe you didn't tell me.
You know that the two pillars of marriage
are openness and honesty.
I knew giving you that book
was gonna come back and bite me in the ass.
Friends S08E08 The One With The Stripper
How about I order everyone the Moroccan chicken?
Oh, I don't eat meat.
It's chicken!
I don't eat that either.
I never understand you lesbians.
So, baby, tell me, what's new with you?
Well, actually...
Your '74 Lafite, sir.
'74?
I ordered the '75. That's a magnificent wine.
The '74 is sewage!
Why would you bring me sewage?
Is that a hard question?
Are you an idiot? Is that why you're a waiter?
This is why I told the manager i wouldn't wait on you tonight.
Oh, come on. Don't be such a baby.
In case you didn't notice, that is a scary man.
He's right, though. The '74 is absolute piss.
This was such a huge mistake.
I can't tell him, Phoebe. I can't. I can't. I can't.
 Rachel...  No, it's okay. This is what's gonna happen.
I'm gonna wait a couple of years,
and then the baby will tell him.
Why? So he can get mad at the baby?
Hey, that is the baby's problem.
Everything okay with the waiter?
I have no idea. I went to the bathroom.
So, sweetie, you were starting to tell me what is new with you.
I got TiVo.
 What's TiVo?  It's slang for "pregnant."
Phoebe.
Are you really pregnant?
Well, yes and no.
Except, not no.
So to sum it up, yeah.
Who is the father?
Oh, no. Please don't tell me it's her.
No, it's Ross. It's Ross. You like Ross.
Daddy, I hope you're okay with all of this.
Think about it. This is a good thing.
This is your first grandchild!
You're gonna be a poppy!
That's true. I'm a poppy!
I'm gonna be a poppy!
 So when is the wedding?  The who?
The wedding. There's going to be a wedding.
Young lady, don't you sit there and tell me
my first grandchild is gonna be a bastard!
Rachel Karen Green, tell me there is gonna be a wedding!
February 2nd!
It was really cool seeing you lecture today.
Thanks. Although it kind of seemed like
you were falling asleep there a little.
No, no, I had my eyes closed
so I could concentrate and, you know, take it all in.
Yeah, a lot of my students do that.
 I've got to get going.  Okay, I'll see you tonight?
 Yeah, okay.  Bye.
Thanks for showing me your semipreciousstone collection.
It's amazing.
My God, you must be good in bed.
So you and Mona, it's been a while now. How's it going?
It's good. It's going good.
I mean, we get along great. She's so...
 Hot?  I was gonna say sweet, but yeah!
She's okay with Rachel and the baby?
I haven't actually told her yet.
I don't wanna scare her off, you know?
You have to be honest with her.
Otherwise, you may think you're going down the same path...
...but you're really going down different ones.
I'm gonna take that book and I'm gonna beat you to death with it.
Oh, my God, you are gonna love me so much.
I felt bad about the bachelorette party thing...
...so tonight you're gonna have a bachelor party.
What?
I got this number from this guy at work
and I hired a stripper to come dance for you.
Am I going in the wife hall of fame or what?
Honey, that's crazy. I don't want a stripper.
Will you let the lady talk?
Come on, it'll be fun.
It'll make me feel so much better.
Look, I appreciate it, but it's a little creepy.
I'm not a bachelor anymore.
Don't think of it as a bachelor party.
Think of it as a twomonth anniversary present.
Sure. One year is paper,
but two months is lap dance.
Please, I feel so bad.
Just watch the hot woman get naked!
 Fine, but I'm only doing this for you.  Yeah!
And Joey.
Thank you. Who else do you wanna invite?
No, no, no. Just Ross and Joey is embarrassing enough.
Actually, sorry, I can't even make it. I'm seeing Mona tonight.
I understand: who would cancel an actual date
just to go to a fake bachelor party?
I'm sorry. I gotta cancel tonight, baby.
I'm sorry I won't make it to your imaginary wedding,
but I'm busy that day.
I already have a unicorn baptism and a leprechaun bar mitzvah.
I know, I know. I panicked. I panicked.
I didn't want him to start yelling at me
like I was some '74 Latour.
It's Lafite.
The '74 Latour is actually drinking quite nicely.
All right, here he comes. I'm gonna tell him. I'm gonna be strong.
I just called a friend of mine.
I think I may be able to book The Plaza
on short notice.
Really?
The Plaza?
Oh, Daddy!
Right. Daddy, I need to talk to you. Please sit down.
What is it, sweetie?
There's not gonna be a wedding.
 Ross and I aren't getting married.  What?
 I'm sorry, Daddy.  I don't believe this!
Daddy, stay calm, please.
Stay calm? How do you expect me to stay calm?
This is unacceptable, Rachel. And I wanna know why!
Is it because that punk Ross won't marry you?
 That's it. Is that it?  Yes. He says I'm damaged goods.
So, you nervous about getting married?
What are you doing?
Let's pretend it's a real bachelor party, before your wedding.
It'll be more fun.
All right. I can't believe tomorrow's the big day.
How's it feel knowing you're never gonna
be with another woman again?
Knowing you're gonna have to wake up to the same face every day...
...until you finally have the sweet release of death.
You're right. This is more fun.
That's her! Okay, come on!
Which one of you lucky boys is Chandler?
That's me!
That's me.
Joey Tribbiani. Big fan.
 Is that a bedroom?  Yeah, right over there.
All right. Whenever you're ready.
That was weird.
 Why would she go in the bedroom?  I'm waiting.
 So she's a...  Yeah, that's one naked hooker.
I love your place. Where is this guy from?
That's an 18thcentury Indian artifact from Calcutta.
So you're more than just dinosaurs.
So much more.
Oh, my God! I am so sorry!
Forget it. It's from Pier 1.
Sorry.
You think you can knock up my daughter
and then not marry her?
I'm gonna kill you!
You know, this is actually not a great time for me.
So come on. Explain yourself, Geller.
First, you get my Rachel pregnant.
You got Rachel pregnant?
 Who did?  You did!
Yes.
Yes, I did, but it was a onenight thing. It meant nothing.
Oh? Really? That's what my daughter means to you, nothing?
No, sir. She means a lot to me.
I care... I love Rachel.
 What?  But not that way.
I'm not in love with her. I love her like a friend.
Really? That's how you treat a friend,
you get her in trouble and refuse to marry her?
Hey, I offered to marry her. But I didn't want to.
Well, why not? So you could spend your time with this tramp?
Tramp?
I'm sorry.
Dr. Green, Mona. Mona, Dr. Green.
I can't believe there is a naked hooker in there!
Wait, wait. Maybe she's a hooker and a stripper...
...but she got confused about what's she supposed to do.
Could be. I mean, technically, she did strip.
We just missed it.
Ma'am?
Are you also a stripper?
No, but I can pretend to strip. But that's gonna cost extra.
Okay, here's the extras: Handcuffs, spanking...
Maybe Monica's playing a joke on you.
You know? Getting her own husband a hooker. That's pretty funny.
That is funny. Maybe for my birthday she'll murder someone.
I'll bet Ross was in on it too.
I mean, he was "conveniently" busy.
Do you mind if I smoke in here?
Actually, I'd rather...
Yeah, go ahead. We're gonna have to burn that room down anyway.
How could you have kept all this from me?
I was going to tell you, but...
But what? You figure you'd get what you wanted,
then you'd dump her like you did Rachel.
Hey, I did not dump Rachel. Nor are we still together.
Can I...?
Why don't we just let the machine get that.
Hey, Ross, it's Joey. There's a hooker over here...
...and we thought maybe you'd know something about it.
No! No! No!
No! I need to lie down.
So, tonight's the night of the big bachelor party?
Yeah. Thanks for giving me that girl's number.
No problem. Say, who's the party for?
 For my husband.  You hired your husband a hooker?
 She's a stripper.  No, she's a hooker.
Is that what they call strippers sometimes?
When they're hookers.
Oh, my God. Stu, I can't believe you did this.
Now, you're absolutely sure she's a hooker?
It's either that, or she's just the best,
most expensive date I ever had.
Maybe she meant to get you a hooker.
Why would she do that?
Maybe she wants you to learn something.
Is there anything you're really bad at, you know, sexually?
This is the worst bachelor party ever.
 What's taking you boys so long?  In a minute!
"In a minute"? What's gonna happen in a minute?
All right. Maybe you should ask her to leave.
 Why me?  Hey, it's your bachelor party.
Which is why you should do it.
I don't want to. You do it.
 You do it.  You do it.
All right. Rock, paper, scissors
for who has to tell the whore to leave.
What?
I miss this.
I don't think we've actually done this before.
No, I miss hanging out with you.
 We still hang out.  Not like we used to.
Remember? You and me, we used to be inseparable.
You know, now it's like things are different.
Well, you know, things are different. I'm married now.
And, hey, don't get me wrong, I am so happy for you guys.
I just miss hanging out. Just us, you know?
Yeah, I miss that too.
I'll tell you what. From now on,
we'll make time to hang out with each other.
You got it. Come here.
Oh, God.
Listen, I am this close to robbing you guys.
She's a hooker! She's a hooker! She's a...
Hi. We spoke on the phone.
So your dad dropped by.
He's a pleasant man.
 Oh, no.  I better go.
Just over here. I don't wanna miss the fight.
Ross, I am so sorry.
I promise, I will straighten this out
with him tomorrow, in person.
Or via email.
I don't care about your dad. I care about Mona.
She was there and now she's totally freaked out!
Okay, I'll fix that too.
 What's her email address?  Rachel.
All right, I promise, I'll fix this. I swear. I'll talk to her.
Okay. Thank you.
That's it? You call that a fight?
Come on. "We were on a break!" "No, we weren't!"
What happened to you two?
Thank you so much for coming back over.
Oh, good. You're here.
And I was worried that it was going to be uncomfortable.
No, Mona, just hear me out.
First of all, I am so sorry about my father yelling at you.
But I heard that you held your own.
You have to tell me how you did that.
 Focus.  Okay.
Yes, Ross and I used to date.
And yes, we are gonna have a baby.
But we are definitely not getting back together.
How can I be sure of that?
Because we drove each other crazy.
He was possessive, he was jealous.
He could never just let the little things go.
Trying to date this woman.
None of that compared to how kind and gentle...
...and thoughtful he is.
You probably shouldn't touch me.
I don't wanna get in the middle of something so complicated.
I get it, but, Mona,
what relationship is not complicated?
We all have our baggage. You must too.
Why else would you still be single?
I'm so gonna leave right now.
Should I leave this open for you too?
I'm not sure yet. Why didn't you just tell me about all this?
Because what's going on with Rachel
has nothing to do with how I feel about you.
You still should have told me.
I know, and I was going to, but...
I thought it was better that you heard it from Rachel's father.
I made a mistake...
...but it's only because I really, really like you. Really.
Okay. I guess you can close the door now.
Forgot my purse. Oh, you guys made up.
He's a good kisser, isn't he? I'm going!
I swear I didn't know she was a hooker.
Did you let her smoke in here?
Her assprint is still on your grandmother's quilt.
Do you really want to talk about smoking?
You know what, I'm gonna make this up to you.
I promised you a stripper...
...and you're gonna get a stripper.
 Monica, wait.  What?
Carry on.
These tennis shoes are so tight.
 I think I'll take them off.  Could you not narrate?
Gotcha, sailor.
Just because you're not in love with the guy...
 You told your dad the truth.  About an hour ago.
 Wanna go see a movie?  Yes.
Bye, Dad.
It's unacceptable! What the hell does love have to do with it?
There are more important things than love.
You have to think about the baby.
You have to think about the consequences of your decisions!
Hey, I do think about the consequences of my decisions!
Well, what gives you the right to...?
Go to hell!
Stupid guy on my phone.
Rach, listen. Did you know that during pregnancy...
...your fingers swell up to twice their size
and never go back?
Oh, my God! Let me see that.
You fall for it every time.
Hey! I brought you my old maternity clothes.
Oh, Pheebs, that's so sweet.
 Oh, those are so cute!  Yes.
Look. See how they expand as the baby grows?
And then after the baby's born
they're great for shoplifting melons.
Good, you're all here. Okay. Thanksgiving, tomorrow, 4:00.
Guess who I invited?
Remember Will Culvert from high school?
 No.  He was in Ross' class.
Marching band, was kind of overweight.
Really overweight.
I was his thin friend.
I don't remember him.
Are you sure you're not talking about your imaginary boyfriend?
No, that was Jared.
Haven't thought about him in a long time.
Anyway, Will's here on business,
and he didn't have a place to go, so I invited him here.
 That's nice.  Oh, he's lost a bunch of weight.
He looks good. Okay, I mean really gorgeous.
I still love Chandler.
Wouldn't hurt you to say it once in a while.
Just so you know, I'm not gonna make a turkey this year...
 What?  Phoebe doesn't eat turkey.
 Phoebe!  Turkeys are beautiful, intelligent animals.
No, they're not! They're ugly and stupid and delicious!
It's not just Phoebe.Will's still on a diet,
Chandler doesn't eat Thanksgiving food...
 Rachel's having her aversion to poultry.  She is?
Yeah. Remember? I had to leave the other day
when you had that roast chicken.
Yeah. I thought that was because I put the whole thing on my hand
and made it walk across the table.
It's not worth it to make a whole turkey for just three people.
It's a lot of work.
But you gotta have turkey on Thanksgiving!
I mean, Thanksgiving with no turkey is like
Fourth of July with no apple pie.
Or Friday with no two pizzas.
Fine, if it means that much to you.
But there's gonna be a ton left over.
No, there won't. I promise I will finish that turkey.
You're telling me you can eat almost
an entire turkey in one sitting?
That's right. Because I'm a Tribbiani!
This is what we do.
We may not be great thinkers or world leaders...
...we don't read a lot or run fast,
but damn it, we can eat!
Friends S08E09 The One With The Rumor
Four wide receivers. On third and 18.
Isn't it weird to think about how next year there this time
there will be a baby at the table?
Rachel's.
But good to know where you're at.
 Happy Thanksgiving.  You too!
 Anything I can do to help?  Actually there is.
Chandler usually helps me with this, but he's really into the game
so I don't want to bother him.
 Could you help me to fold these napkins?  Sure.
 I'm gonna go across the hall to check on the yams.  Okay.
No, sweetie. No, not like that.
We're not at a barn dance.
You've gotta fold them like swans.
Like I showed you at Christmas. Remember?
Yeah, it all just came screaming back to me.
 So how's the game?  I have no idea.
 What?  Yeah, I'm just pretending to watch the game
...so I don't have to help out with stuff.
I don't believe you!
That is brilliant!
 And Monica has no idea?  No.
Every once and a while, I just scream stuff at the TV.
Hey! What? Aw! Hey!
 Your team winning, hon?  Yeah. Anderson just scored again.
There is no Anderson.
I wanna get in on this. Hey, Mon?
I don't think I can help you after all.
I didn't realize this game was on.
 I don't know you like football.  Normally, I don't.
But, you know, Green Bay is playing.
 You like Green Bay?  It's only my favorite bay.
Happy Thanksgiving.
Thanks. Will, I'm so glad that you came.
You look great. You must've lost like...
150 pounds.
I'll be on one of those Subway sandwich commercials.
 A pie!  It's no fat, it's no sugar, it's no dairy.
It's no good. Throw it out.
You wanna meet some people.
This is my husband, Chandler. Chandler, this is Will.
Oh, hey. I'd shake your hand but I'm really into the game.
Plus, I think it'd be better for my ego
if we didn't stand right next to each other.
This is Phoebe.
Well done.
 Wanna give me a hand?  Sure.
Monica, I can't get over how great you look. You look stunning.
You look incredible too. You're so fit.
I'm watching the game, but I'm not deaf.
I meant to tell you, Ross is coming.
Ross is coming. Great, I love Ross.
Good. And Rachel Greene too.
 Is there a problem?  No. It's okay.
It's just... God, I hated her.
 What?  Yeah. I hated her.
She was horrible to me in high school.
But hey, that was a long time ago.
I'm in a good place. Might be fun to see her again.
Got any cakes or cookies or something?
No, Will! No!
It's been a while since we screamed. Maybe we should.
 Oh, okay. No!  Come on!
Damn you, ref! You burn in hell!
What are you doing?
You gotta save room, you've got almost an entire turkey to eat.
Let me explain to you how the human body works.
I have to warm up my stomach first.
 Eating chips is like stretching.  Okay.
Don't worry, Tribbianis never get full.
I actually know what you're talking about.
I'm here to tell you something, friend.
You can eat and eat, but nothing will ever fill that void.
Who the hell is this guy?
This is Will, from high school. This is Joey.
 Will!  Ross!
Hey, you came!
Man, you look incredible! Hot stuff!
 Hot stuff ?  It's good to see you, man.
Yeah. You too. So, what are you up to?
 I'm a commodities broker.  Really? That sounds interesting.
Yeah, it's not.
But I'm rich and thin.
I haven't seen you since Lance Davis' graduation party.
That was such a fun night.
Would've been good if we had gotten in, but still real fun.
We were lame back then.
Do you remember how into dinosaurs we were?
 Yeah.  So, what do you do now?
So how long are you in town?
Hey, sweetie. Oh, good.
Rachel Greene.
Oh, that's right. Are you gonna be okay?
Oh, I'll be fine. It's just...
God, I hate her, Ross! I hate her!
Will, high school was a long time ago.
Look at her standing there with those yams.
My two greatest enemies, Ross:
Rachel Greene and complex carbohydrates.
Oh, my God. Monica, who is that?
That's Will, from high school.
Oh! I do not remember him.
Wow, really got that sexy smoldering thing going on.
Oh, my God. Look at the way he's just staring at me.
He's trying to mouth something to me, but I can't make it out.
I hate you!
 Okay, dinner's ready!  Okay!
 Solid effort. Solid effort.  Oh, so who won?
 Green Bay.  Detroit.
 What?  The Lions technically won.
But it was a moral victory for the Green Bay Mermen.
 Hi! Will, right?  Right.
Right, hi. I'm Rachel Greene.
 Oh, I remember you.  Really? aren't you sweet?
I gotta tell you though, I'm having the hardest time placing you.
Hang on! I think I remember you.
Did we...
Did we fool around at Lance Davis' graduation party?
 You are unbelievable.  Thank you.
Rachel? Why don't you sit here? And Will, you sit way over there.
That's it?
Even if nobody helps me, I can eat that.
No problem. At least give me a challenge.
This is Chandler's chicken.
This is the turkey.
How big is that?
About 19 pounds.
It's like me when I was born.
Alright. Who would like some yams? Will?
You'd like that, wouldn't you?
What? Oh, you know what, can we please keep the chicken...
...and the turkey and everything on the other side of the table?
 The smell is just...  Typical.
 I'm sorry. What?  I said it was typical.
Typical of you. Rachel Green.
Queen Rachel does whatever she wants in Rachelland.
Seriously, who is this guy?
Sorry, do you have a problem with me?
I don't know. Do I? Do I?
I think you do.
Apparently, You were a little mean to him in high school.
A little mean? You made my life miserable.
I had no idea. I'm sorry.
Well, you should be. Screw it.
Bring on the yams.
Will, but you worked so hard.
 Yams!  Okay.
Will, I just want to say that I'm real sorry
for whatever I did to you in high school.
It wasn't just me. We had a club.
You had a club?
That's right. The "I Hate Rachel Greene Club"!
My god. So you all just joined together to hate me?
 Who else was in this club?  Me and Ross.
No need to point. She knows who Ross is.
 You were in an "I Hate Rachel" club?  Yes, he was.
No, no.
So who else was in this club?
Actually, there was also that exchange student from Thailand
but I don't think he knew what it was.
So, Ross, we went out for two years...
...and you never told me you were in an "I Hate Rachel Club"?
You went out with her? We had a pact.
It was in high school. It's not like it was binding forever.
Then why did it have the word eternity in it?
Monica? Did you know about this?
I swear I didn't.
Is that why you used to lock the bedroom door?
 Yeah.  A little relieved, I gotta say.
Look, Rach, I'm sorry, okay?
I was a stupid kid, okay?
 The only reason I joined...  Cofounded.
Cofounded.
Cofounded the club, was that I was insanely in love with you.
Obviously I didn't handle it very well.
If you think about it,
the "I Hate Rachel Club" was really the "I Love Rachel Club."
Except that it was really the "I Hate Rachel Club."
Okay. So you'd get together and like just say mean things about me?
 We did a little more than that.  No, no, no.
What else did you do?
 We started a rumor.  What rumor?
Come on, Will, just take off your shirt and tell us.
 Ross?  It was no big deal.
We said that...
The rumor was that...
...you had both male and female reproductive parts.
 What?  That's right. We said your parents...
...flipped a coin, decided to raise you as a girl,
but you still had a hint of a penis.
 Oh, my God!  You started that?
 What? You heard that?  Everyone at our school heard it!
Everyone at my school heard it.
You were the hermaphrodite cheerleader from Long Island?
Oh, no!
Oh my God! This is all making so much sense to me now!
This is why Adam Can'ter wouldn't go out with me.
This is why Billy Tratt would just stay in this region!
Actually, Billy Tratt is gay now,
so that one's not really our fault.
Monica, how come you never told me this?
I thought it might be true.
I was afraid that you were gonna cry and then show it to me.
Joey, stop staring! There's nothing there!
It's not true!
I'm afraid I'm gonna need proof.
You are my Everest.
Joey, you don't have to finish that.
Yes, I do. Otherwise, what's next?
Today I’m just a guy who can't finish a turkey,
but tomorrow I'm the guy who eats half a Powerbar,
...wrap it up and put it in the fridge? No!
I just... I just gotta change my pants.
What was I thinking? Jeans have no give.
Okay, okay.
Listen to what Sean McMahon wrote in my yearbook senior year.
"Dear Rach, you're such a great person."
Not girl, "person."
Rach, I think you're reading a little too much into it.
"Dear Rach. You're a great person.
Sorry about your teeny weenie."
What do you want me to do...
I want me to call everyone in the entire school
and tell them it wasn't true?
 Yes.  Could you also tell them I'm skinny now?
Oh! Me too!
Look, I won't call anybody.
It was a million years ago.
I don't care how long ago it was.
You told people that I was half and half!
You know what? I just want to point out
I never did anything to hurt you in high school.
That's not totally true.
 What?  What?
You did start that rumor about Ross...
...making out with Mrs. Altmann, our 50yearold librarian.
How did you know that?
 It's true?  No.
Yes, it is. I saw you guys going at it behind the card catalog.
Mrs. Altmann?
She also made out with TaTakaKiKek
the night before he went back to Thailand.
I'm sorry. When you were in high school
you made out with a 50yearold woman?
Hey, she didn't look 50!
Did she look 16?
There's a picture of her in the yearbook actually.
 Wow.  She didn't photograph well!
She probably wasn't familiar with the process
having spent most of her life sitting for oil paintings.
How did this happen?
Did she lure you to an earlybird dinner? 
I was working late in the library one afternoon.
It was just the two of us.
She needed some help with her word jumble.
And one thing led to another.
If you must know,
Anita was very gentle and tender.
May she rest in peace.
Did't she walk with a cane?
Only when it was damp!
I can't believe you told people about this.
Everybody knew?
 You know what? I'm back in the club!  Yeah!
 I wanna join!  Phoebe?
I'm sorry, but I never got to be in a club.
I didn't go to high school.
But three of us would meet behind a dumpster to learn French.
Bonjour.
Fine, you can have your stupid, little club.
but I would just like to say is what you did to me
is way worse than what I did to you!
 You gave me a teeny weenie.  Yeah!
Alright, listen.
You're just being silly. Rachel, even with that rumor...
...you were one of the most popular girls in school.
Everyone wanted to be like you.
One girl wanted to be like you so much,
she stuffed her pants with a Tootsie Roll.
And Ross, if it weren't for Rachel's rumor,
no one in high school would've even known who you were.
She put you on the map.
As a romancer of the elderly.
Mrs. Altman was the kind of woman
you could tell she used to be pretty.
The eyes did still sparkle.
Guys, this stuff is so way in the past.
You've been through so much since then.
And right now, you got so much more important stuff
going on in your life.
Can't you just let this go?
 She's right.  Yeah, I mean. We are having a baby together.
Hold on.
 You got her pregnant?  Yeah.
 Are you getting married?  No.
So you knocked her up but you're not gonna marry her. Dude.
 Anybody?  Okay.
It's exactly how I imagined it would be.
All right, where's that turkey?
Joey, those are my maternity pants!
No, these are my Thanksgiving pants!
Well, that's it. I'm done.
Here come the meat sweats.
Well, Joey, we're all very proud of you.
I believe we can expect a call from the president any moment now.
Anything we can do for you?
No. Just nobody press on my stomach.
You can keep those pants, by the way.
What you got there? What is that, pie?
Yeah. You want some?
Just cut me a little sliver.
Little bigger.
Little bigger.
Are you afraid you're gonna run out? Cut me a real piece!
So, what do you think?
New haircut? Necklace? Dress?
Boots? Boots!
Now, they're a little more than I usually spend on boots. Or rent.
Oh, my God.
I know.
I'll miss being able to afford food.
I'm sorry. They just looked so good.
The saleswoman was looking at me like:
"These are too expensive for you."
She had a point.
Oh, Monica, those boots are amazing.
They're mine!
Too bad we're gonna have to return them.
Return them? They're gonna hear you.
Honey, I'm not returning them.
I know they cost a lot, but I'll wear them all the time.
You'll see. Besides, I love the compliments.
Have you ever had something so beautiful, everyone wants it?
I have you.
Nice try. I'm keeping the boots.
Friends S08E10 The One With Monica's Boots
That's right. I love you.
And I'm gonna play with you all the time.
How can you let him talk to your crotch like that?
 He's talking to the baby.  Oh! Okay.
Okay, because when he said,
"I can't wait for your first words"...
...I thought, "There's a trick."
Well, I gotta go, you guys. I'll see you later.
 Okay. Bye.  Bye.
Hey, Rach, listen. Can you do me a favor?
I was talkin' to my sister
and she knows you you work at Ralph Lauren...
Forget it. No way.
I am not sending more Ralph Lauren clothes to prison.
 It is a waste.  No, not her.
My youngest sister, Dina, she is interested in fashion.
She wants to talk to someone successful to give her some advice.
I guess I could talk to my supervisors.
No, she wants to talk to you.
Really? Oh, my God. I'm successful.
Okay, so would you meet with her?
Yes, I'd love to. Have her come by the office.
Great, thanks. You'll love her so much.
She's the smartest of all the Tribbiani children.
 Yeah, you know the SATs?  Yeah.
She took them.
Ross, doesn't Ben go to Smithfield Day School?
Yeah. Why?
Sting has a son that goes there too.
I know. He's in Ben's class.
You knew and never said anything?
With all the stupid dinosaur stuff you tell us?
Fine, no more dinosaur stuff.
Can I talk about fossils?
"Sting's son, 7 years old." And there's a picture.
What are you reading,
"The Kidnapper's Guide to Manattan Private Schools"?
It's New York Magazine.
It's an article about best schools in the city.
So how well do you know Sting?
I actually haven't even met him.
Yeah. That's too bad.
I really wanna go to his concert Friday night,
but it's totally sold out.
I know! Why don't you meet him and get tickets.
If you get two, I'll take you.
Actually, I'm picking Ben up tomorrow. Maybe he'll be there.
There you go. You're so lucky.
You might get to meet Sting tomorrow.
That's why you have kids.
Hey, guys.
Hi, Monica. Hi, boots.
See, Chandler?
I'm getting a lot of use out of them already.
They're very practical.
You can wear them with dresses, with skirts, with pants...
You wear them with shorts on the corner
and earn the money to pay for them.
Wow, they're beautiful.
They hurt so much.
 What?  The guy who made these...
...hates feet and wants to see them die.
Give them to me.
I haven't felt my feet in years.
I can't. I spent so much money on them
and I told Chandler I'd wear them all the time.
I can't just give them away.
Then get your money back and return them.
I can't do that either.
The soles are already a little scuffed up,
and the insides are filled with my blood.
Hey, I just picked up Ben from school.
I don't think you did a very thorough job.
I dropped him off at Carol's.
Anyway, it turns out I'm not gonna get those tickets, though.
Oh, no. Why not?
It turns out Ben and Sting's son do not get along.
How come?
Apparently, Sting's son made fun of the fact that
Ben's moms are "lesbenims."
Wait, Ross. If they don't get along,
then you should smooth things over.
Make them be friends.
 Phoebe, you can't force kids to be friends.  Sure you can.
Give them some blocks. Put them in a playpen.
 Playpen? Ben's 7.  Your kid is 7?
He's really small.
Please get the tickets.
I'm sorry, Pheebs. I just can't do it.
Yes, you can. Sting says so himself.
 What?  Ross can.
Look, I'm sorry...
Ross can.
 Phoebe?  Ross can get me the tickets.
Ross can get me the tickets.
Here she is: Future fashion superstar.
 Oh, Joey, I'm hardly...  My little sister Dina.
 Hi, Dina. Nice to meet you.  Hi.
Thanks so much for meeting with me.
Joey's told me so much about you.
This is so exciting for her.
Well, I'll let you two "fashists"
get down to business.
Okay. All right, Dina.
Well, let's talk about the different areas of fashion...
...that you could get involved in.
Let's see, there's design.
But you may need a whole other degree for that.
There's sales which is great, because you get to travel.
I don't care about fashion.
I'm pregnant. And I know you are too, so you gotta help me.
Then there's marketing.
 What's wrong?  Nothing. I just was yawning.
Don't forget, my office holiday party's tonight.
Honey, we don't really have to go to this thing, do we?
Sweetie, I know that you don't like my office parties,
but you can wear your new boots.
See? Every cloud has a supple leather lining.
 I don't wanna wear the boots tonight.  Why not?
Well, you know. I'm worried your bosses will see them
and think they pay you too much money.
Or your assistant will see them and want a raise.
Do you think I work some kind of bootpricing company?
I picked out this outfit I wanna wear,
and the boots don't go with it.
You said that you paid all that money
because those boots go with skirts, dresses, and pants!
Fine. If you want me to, I'll wear the boots.
In fact, I'll go into my room right now and try the outfit on.
Christmas party in my boots!
I can't go in there. I can't tell him.
It's gonna be okay.
He has been incredibly supportive of me.
And if he gets a little upset,
that's what the meatball sub is for.
 Thank you.  Okay.
Hey! It's my fashion girls.
 What's wrong?  Why don't you sit down.
Dina has something that she wants to tell you.
What's going on? Is it Mom? Is she sick?
Is it Dad's heart?
Is that a sandwich?
 Joe, Mom and Dad are fine.  Is that a sandwich?!
Joey, there's something that you should know.
Dina?
 I'm pregnant.   What?
Now. Give him the sandwich! Give him the sandwich!
Obviously, this is a mistake. You can't be pregnant.
Because you have to have sex to get pregnant.
Joe, I tried to wait until I was 25, like you did.
What? Dina...
I can't believe this. You're the good one.
You went to college! Both years!
Who did this to you?
Bobby Corso. But he's a real nice guy.
I like him a lot. He's real funny.
You got pregnant for "funny"?
Dina, if he's funny, laugh!
I'll be back in a little while. You stay here!
Why? Where you going?
I can't look at you right now.
I know.
Oh, there you are, Ben.
Aunt Phoebe, what are you doing here?
Well, I heard you're having a problem
with one of the boys in your class.
So I thought I'd come down here and sit you both down,
have a little talk and make it all okay.
Now, the boy's name is Sting's son.
Jack? I hate him. He's a jerk.
Now, Ben. Sometimes people may seem like jerks on the outside...
...but they have famous fathers.
I have to go. My friend Doug is waiting for me over there.
Him, you're friends with.
Excuse me, can I help you with something?
Yes. I'm looking for Jack's parents.
 Are you with one of the students?  I'm with Ben.
Are you one of Ben's mothers?
I am one of Ben's mothers.
I'm a lesbian.
It was difficult coming out to my parents.
Well, hi. I'm Jenny Boon. I'm a new teacher here.
I've only met your partner, Carol.
That would make me Susan.
Right. Are you looking for Jack's parents
to discuss his problems he's having with Ben?
Yeah, because I really do think the parents
should sit down together and have a conversation.
Yeah, let's do that!
That sounds good.
We should sit down and talk.
Just me, my lover, Carol, and the Stings.
How will I get in touch with them?
Their number's on the contact sheet.
Could I get a copy of that?
Carol threw it out. She lost ours.
She's such a scatterbrain.
But, man, what a hot piece of ass.
You know, that party wasn't bad.
Yeah. I didn't know there'd be dancing.
That was a fun surprise.
I don't see a cab. Maybe we should walk.
No, we can't walk.
It's 15 blocks to the subway. Come on.
Do you think we can get to the subway right there
if we climb through that manole cover?
What's going on?
I can't walk, okay?
 These boots were a huge mistake.  What?
Okay, you were right. I never should have bought them.
They're killing me, one toe at a time.
So I was right. This is what it feels like to be right.
It's oddly unsettling.
How are we gonna we get home? Maybe a piggyback ride?
 Hop on.  Okay, wait, just give me a second.
Let me just get my boots off first.
Oh, God.
Honey, I know you're in pain right now,
but I'm a little turnedon.
Do you ever worry that you'll be walking
and your baby will just slip out?
What college was that, Dina?
Oh, my God. Bobby?
Hi, Dina. Good to see you.
Joey, what are you doing?
Just what needs to be done.
Dearly beloved, we're gathered here...
Joey, this is crazy.
Don't interrupt me when I'm talking to God!
Where were we?
 Right, okay. Do you Dina take this man...?  No!
 You'll take him.  No, I won't!
 You don't get a say in this.  Yes, I do.
I heard "I do." We're halfway there.
Okay. You.
All right, Joey, that is enough!
Listen. As beautiful and moving as this ceremony is,
this is not legal.
Okay. They don't have a marriage license
and they don't have any witnesses,
and the groom only has one shoe.
Yeah, he took the other one off and hit me with it.
What am I supposed to do?
You're supposed to realize they are adults
and that can make their own decisions.
No, they can't. They were stupid enough to get knocked up!
Contraceptives are not always effective. Right?
Yeah. We kind of didn't use any.
Come on, kids, a little help here!
Wow! This place is incredible!
Sting's pen...
...that he gave to Phoebe.
Come on, secret passageway.
I'm Trudie. You must be Ben's mum.
Why else would I be here?
Why don't you sit down.
I gather Jack and Ben haven't been getting along lately.
I'm sure there are two sides to this story.
But all I've heard is that Ben's a bit of a "poopoohead."
I'm sorry, won't Jack's father be joining us?
Well, I'm sorry. Jack's father's not available.
Okay. Well, then, could we reschedule for Friday night,
perhaps at 8:00?
No, I know that wouldn't work.
My husband's in concert.
Concert. Yeah.
That does put us in quite a pickle.
Because you see I'm busy before and after the concert,
and he's obviously busy during.
So I guess you and I should talk about Jack and Ben right now.
Unless... Unless...
Okay, I would be willing to go to the concert...
...all the while thinking about the children, of course.
Are you here for tickets?
Thank you. Four would be great.
I'm not giving concert tickets
to someone who'd use their son like this.
Then you're in luck. Ben's not my son.
Look, I've just pressed a button triggering a silent alarm.
Any minute now, the police will be here.
The Police? Here?
A reunion?
Okay, 10 blocks down. Five to go.
Oh, wait! Stop, stop!
Oh, I'm sorry. Do you need a break?
My boots in tan!
Can you get a little closer so I see the price?
I can see it from right here. It'll cost you one husband.
I'm sorry. I can walk the rest of the way now.
Just give me my boots.
I don't have your boots.
I don't have them either. Where are they?
Why don't you check in one of my saddlebags
while I chew on a bale of hay?
Okay. My God, we gotta go back and get them!
Hoeny, are you ever gonna wear the boots again?
Okay, I'll never wear them again.
I just didn't get a chance to say goodbye.
You know what? You can say goodbye to the tan ones.
 Okay. All right.  Okay.
Bye, boots. Wait! Half off!
Joey, just because they're not getting married
doesn't mean this is gonna be a disaster.
Maybe they have a plan.
Oh, okay, let's hear their plan.
Now, what's the future look like for Dina and Bobby?
Well...
...I really have high hopes for my band.
 You were right. He is funny.  Now, wait a minute.
I bet when you told people
you wanted to be an actor, they laughed at you.
Come on, Bobby, tell us a little bit about your band.
Well, it's just me and my pal Rooster.
The band's name is Numbnuts.
Really?
Dina, if you're having a baby, you should be married.
Even if it is to Bobby. Dude, that's not a compliment.
Joey, I knew you wouldn't be supportive.
So, what are you gonna do?
You're gonna have the baby and raise it by yourself?
Without a husband?
You can't be a single mother alone!
You're gonna ruin your life!
Excuse me. Am I ruining my life?
No, it's different for you.
You're so strong and together.
You're not some dumb kid who doesn't know what she's doing.
Excuse me?
One pregnant woman at a time, please!
I just want you to be okay.
So forcing her to marry Bobby is gonna make that happen?
Maybe.
Yeah. So, what kind of music does Numbnuts...?
Oh, forget it! I can't!
Joey, I am scared to death about this.
But I really think I can do it. I'm just gonna need some help.
 Bobby's gonna be here the whole time.  You bet I am.
And to answer your earlier question,
we're straightup gangster rap.
Look, Rachel's told me how much easier you've made all this on her.
Why can't you do that for me?
Because you're my baby sister!
And you're my big brother.
I mean, you're my favorite guy in the whole world.
I'm not even scared to tell Mom and Dad.
I was scared of telling you.
I'd be scared of them, but all right.
Joey, I can't stand the thought of having this baby
with you mad at me.
I want him to have his uncle.
Is my baby gonna have his Uncle Joey?
Of course he's gonna have his Uncle Joey.
We'll be all right.
I mean, even if we're not married, this baby is gonna be so loved.
 And not just by us.  That's right.
By his uncle too.
And by you.
Okay, Bobby, why don't we come over here
and let them have a little moment, okay?
Come here.
No, seriously, what's wrong with you?
You're gonna love me so much.
I got Sting tickets!
Oh, my God, I do love you! How did you do it?
Well, let's just say:
Rose can!
 Where are the seats?  Middle balcony.
Okay. Would you say that's more than 50 yards away
from Sting, his wife or a member of his family?
 Yeah.  Then that's not breaking the law. I'm there!
Phoebe. Will you check out that guy by the window.
He's awfully short.
And I think he's talking to himself.
And to be completely honest, he's not that good in bed.
What is wrong with me lately?
It's like, every guy I see.
I mean, look at that guy, for example.
That's not someone I would be attracted to.
But right now, with the way I'm feeling,
all I want to do is rip off his sweatpants and fanny pack.
Wait a second!
This is about the fourth month of your pregnancy, right?
 Yeah.  This is completely normal.
Around the fourth month, your hormones start going crazy.
 Really? So this has happened to you?  Absolutely! Yeah.
And keep in mind now, I was carrying triplets.
So in medical terms, I was thrice as randy.
Wow, this explains so much!
Last weekend, I went from store to store,
sitting on Santas' laps.
Yeah, I remember trying to steal a cardboard cutout...
...of Evander Holyfield from a Foot Locker.
Well, I go see my doctor tomorrow. I'll ask her about this.
Maybe she can give me a pill or something.
Yeah, that's what you need. A good pill.
Friends S08E11 The One With Ross'Big Step Forward
I got our pictures developed from Rockefeller Center.
Great. Hey, Joey, want to check out pictures
of me and Mona iceskating?
Ordinarily, I would love to,
but I am just swamped right now.
Where are the pictures that
that creepy pretzel vendor took of us together?
Oh, yeah. Probably at the end.
Oh, my God! All he took were pictures of my breasts.
I'm missing picture time!
You know, she has a face, Ross.
 Okay, here's a good one of us.
Wow, that is a good one! It looks like a holiday card.
With the tree in the middle and the skaters and the snow.
Every year, I say I'm gonna send out
holiday cards and I never do it.
Do you want to send this one out together?
Together? Like, to people?
Yeah. "Happy holidays, from Mona and Ross."
It'll be cute, okay?
Okay.
I gotta get to work.
 Call me later?  Sure, sure.
 Bye, guys.  Bye.
Congratulations! You just got married!
I know. Can you believe that?
I'm sorry. What's the big deal about a holiday card?
Married couples send out cards. Families send out cards.
People who have been dating for a couple of months
don't send out cards.
What is she, crazy?
That's your wife you're talking about!
Bing! And the Bingette!
 Oh, honey, you remember my boss, Doug.  Yes. Hi.
Hi. So, good news! The divorce is final.
I signed the papers this a.m.
I didn't know you and Kara divorced. I'm sorry.
Sorry? I finally chewed my leg out of that bear trap.
Congratulations to you guys, though.
No legchewing for us, sir.
Well, give it time.
So the divorce, the marriage, we got a lot to celebrate.
How about we all go out to dinner tomorrow night.
I can't think of anything we're doing.
Why can't I think of anything we're doing?
Tomorrow night it is. I should be out of court by 6.
They keep throwing sexual harassment cases at me...
...and I keep knocking them out of the park!
Okay, see you tomorrow.
Just so you know, we're not seeing him tomorrow.
I can't spend another evening with that man.
Do you remember how he behaved at our wedding?
 No.  That's because he wasn't invited.
Because of the way he behaved at our engagement party.
Oh, yeah! Urine cuts right through an ice sculpture, doesn't it?
Hi! I went by the photo shop. Take a look.
Here is a mockup of our card. What do you think?
Wow, that's great.
Do you think it should say, "Love, Ross and Mona"?
Well, we haven't said that to each other yet...
...but I guess it's okay to say it to other people.
How many did you want?
 I'll get 100. A hundred?
Well, I guess I'll take...
Mona?
I'm not sure about the whole card thing.
Really? Why not?
Sending out a holiday card together?
I just don't know if we're really quite there yet.
I didn't think of it that way. You're right. You're right.
 So can I ask you a question?  Yeah.
Where are we?
You know, like where are we?
Where is this relationship going?
I mean, I love spending time with you.
I just hope we're moving forward.
We should talk about that, don't you think?
Let's do the card!
 What?  The card! I think we're there!
Okay. But I still think we should have this conversation.
Really? I mean...
Even with the card?
Just so you know, Dr. Long can't be here today,
she was called to the hospital, so Dr. Schiff will be seeing you.
Oh, okay. Can I ask you a question?
Was it me, or was the guy who took my blood sample
really cute?
You know who I'm talking about?
Bowl haircut, hairy fingers?
 Hi, Rachel? I'm Dr. Schiff.  Yes, you are.
So, how's it going?
It's going really good. But enough about me! Come on.
Where are you from? What do you do?
 I'm a doctor.  Right. I meant...
...in your spare time. Do you cook? So you ski?
Or just hang out with your wife, or girlfriend?
I don't have a wife or a girlfriend, but I do like to ski.
I love to ski! How amazing is this?
Are you experiencing any discomfort?
No, I'm very comfortable.
 Any painful gas?  No!
No! Shoot, Dr. Schiff! What kind of question is that?
Okay, then. Would you like to lie down on the table?
Would you like me to lie down on the table?
I'm sorry. Is there something going on here?
Do you feel it too?
So, how did your doctor's appointment go?
Well, let's see,
they gave me "cute boy" doctor today.
In the middle of the exam, I put my pinkie in his chin dimple.
 Oh, my God!  Why did you do that?
Remember that little problem
I was having during my fourth month of pregnancy?
Oh, yeah! The Evander Holyfield phase.
Oh, man! You were so hard up, you practically came on to me.
You wish.
Hey, I could have had you if I wanted you.
Oh, yeah? Come and get it.
Okay, even this is turning me on...
Hey, Ross!
How's it going with you and Mona?
Are you guys still together?
Yeah, we're moving forward. You'll be getting our card.
You're doing a holiday card together?
We're not just doing a card.
She also wants to have the conversation...
...about where the relationship is going.
Women!
I know! Why do you guys need to have this conversation?
No selfrespecting man would ask a woman,
"So where is this going?"
Ross, you asked me that.
You were a closed book, okay?
I'm not a mind reader!
Besides, I hate those conversations.
I'm horrible at them. Really.
Maybe I need some kind of a gesture...
...something that says we're moving forward
without having to talk about it.
Like asking her to move in with you?
Smaller than that.
 Making her a mix tape?  Bigger than that.
Give her a key to your apartment.
Hello. We were closer with the mix tape.
Have you said, "I love you"? You could say, "I love you."
I don't think I'm quite there yet.
But I could say, "I love spending time with you."
We hate that.
That is a slap in the face.
Forget it. You know what? I'll just have the conversation.
I'll just say I like things the way they are,
and hope for the best.
What do you think, Rach?
I think if it was a little colder in here...
...I could see your nipples through that sweater.
Bing? We're all set for tonight, 8:00.
As it turns out, we can't do it. Monica has to work.
My exwife didn't work.
Unless you call turning into her mother "work."
Fine. Tomorrow night then.
 Tomorrow's no good for her, either.  Why not?
It's the semifinals...
...of her bocce ball tournament.
What's going on, Bing?
Does your wife have a problem with me or something?
Well, now you're just talking crazy.
Then why can't the three of us go out together?
Because we split up.
Monica and I split up.
Hold me.
Good God, Bing. Well, I can't say I'm altogether surprised.
I saw the way she looked at you, and there was no love there.
And the way she looked at me, pure lust.
What would really help me through this tough time
is choking someone. Can I choke you?
Bing, my boy, we're gonna get you over this.
Here's the plan:
Grab your coat, we're going to a strip club!
Oh, no! Monica would freak.
But to hell with that bitch!
Here we go.
Mona, it's time we had a conversation
about where things are with us.
Yeah, I think I suggested that.
We are so...
Well, I really like you.
And I love hanging out with you.
And I'm having a lot of fun.
Okay.
There's no point in spending time with someone if it's just fun.
It's gotta be going somewhere, right?
So where is it going?
That's the real question.
And the answer is...
...it's going somewhere...
...fun.
I know what you're thinking.
Fun was fine for you 10 years ago.
But you're not getting any younger.
No! I mean, not you. Not you.
You are getting younger!
You're getting younger by the second.
What's your secret?
I'm sorry, so where are we?
Well, to sum up...
...we're having fun.
You look young.
 Okay...  But that's not enough.
So...
...here's a key to my apartment.
 Really?  Really.
You don't think this is too fast?
You gave her a key to your apartment?
Not just a key. I gave her the only key!
I am now a homeless person in a very serious relationship!
Ross, how did the conversation go?
Great. I live on the street.
Where?
Okay, Monica, Rachel...
...this is my friend Roger.  Hi, Roger.
Hi, Roger.
I'll get us some drinks. Could you help me out?
Yeah, okay.
He's here to have sex with you.
 What?  You're welcome.
 Phoebe, no!  It's okay. He's a virgin.
Rachel, I was talking to this guy.
I think he'll have sex with you.
Let's leave these two alone.
No! I don't care what my hormones are doing!
I won't do it with some random guy!
Fine! Then you tell Roger,
because he was really looking forward to this!
Bing! Look at those twin sisters dancing together.
Let me buy you a lap dance with those girls.
That's all right, sir. And that's just one girl.
 Bing, what's this?  It's a hand.
It's a thing you use as a Jack and Coke holder.
No. It's a wedding ring. You gotta get rid of it.
We're gonna go to the East River right now and throw it in there!
 No!  Yes!
I did it, and I felt a lot better!
And if you whip it just right you might hit a seagull in the head.
Okay. I'm gonna need a bunch of extra keys.
Apparently, I give them away for no reason at all.
Ross, what's going on? You're changing the lock?
No.
That guy is.
I don't understand. You give me a key to your apartment,
and then you change the lock?
Good luck, buddy.
I thought we were moving forward.
Now you're sending me all these mixed signals.
What are you trying to tell me?
I'm trying to tell you...
...I made you a mix tape.
 What?  I love you.
And I love spending time with you.
Hi, honey, I'm home.
From the tequila factory?
It was awful.
To get out of going to dinner with Doug,
I told him you and I split up.
So then he took me to these strip clubs and sleazy bars.
When I wouldn't give him my wedding ring,
he threw a soda can at a bird.
Come here. I can breathe through my mouth.
 Oh, sweetie. You know what the worst part was?
I got to see what my life would be like without you.
It was like It's a Wonderful Life with lap dances.
Please promise me that you'll never leave me...
...that we'll grow old together,
and be with each other for the rest of our lives.
I promise.
Speaking of together,
how about we send out a holiday card this year?
I don't know if we're there yet.
I'd like to order a pizza. Can I ask you a question?
Is the cute blond guy delivering tonight?
Very "Abercrombie & Fitch."
 I'll call you back.  Who was that?
It's just the pizza place.
You hung up on the pizza place?
I don't hang up on your friends.
Sorry, honey, I'm just having a rough day.
What's wrong?
You don't want to hear about it.
Then why did I ask?
Okay, this is really embarrassing,
but lately, with this whole pregnancy thing...
...I'm just finding myself...
How do I put this?
Erotically charged.
Is that college talk for "horny"?
Yeah. I have all of these feelings,
and I don't know what to do about them.
I can't date like a normal person,
which is fine because I don't need a relationship.
All I really want is one great night! Just sex.
No strings attached. No relationship.
With someone I feel comfortable with,
and who knows what he's doing.
For just one great night.
I mean, is that really so hard...
...to find?
So how was your day?
Good. I saw a pretty big pigeon.
Well, I gotta get up early, and it's almost 7:00.
 I gotta go to my room.  Good night!
Good night!
 I can't do it!  I didn't ask you to do it!
 You're Rachel!  You're Joey!
 You're my friend!  Right back at you.
Yeah. Plus, it would be wrong, and weird and bad!
So bad! But I don't know what you're talking about.
 Because I didn't ask you to do anything!  I know!
 You wanna do it?  No!
Me neither. I'm just testing you!
Well, that's the end of this conversation!
 This conversation never happened!  Never happened!
 Good night!  Good night!
Get back in there!
Listen, I'm sorry about that whole thing with Roger.
It really wasn't right. And I want to make it up to you.
So I brought you something I think you'll really enjoy.
Now this is just a loan, okay?
I'm gonna want him back.
I'm gonna go now.
I'm sorry. I thought I could do it, and I can't.
Hey, I got you a present!
Oh, my goodness, where did you hide it?
I got it for your wedding and I ordered it weeks ago,
and it finally got here!
Pheebs, you didn't have to get us anything
for our wedding you already sang...
I love it! It's huge! Let's open it! Let's open it!
 It's a Ms. PacMan machine!  Oh, my God!
I didn't know where to put it, so I just left it here for now.
 We can put it in the guest bedroom.  Yeah, okay.
I kind of like it here.
Do you really like it?
Are you kidding?! I practically spent my entire childhood at the arcade.
This is like...Oh my, this is like my second favorite game!
Really? What's your first?
I don't remember the name of it.
Well, what did it do?
You'd put a quarter in, pull some handles
and win a candy bar or something.
A vending machine?
Don't feel bad for me. I won every time!
Friends S08E12 The One Where Joey Dates Rachel
I'm so glad you guys are here.
I've been dying to tell someone
what happened in the paleontology department today.
Do you think he saw us, or can we still slip out?
Professor Newman, the department head, is retiring, so...
They made you head of the department!
No, I get to teach one of his advanced classes!
Why didn't I get head of the department?
Hey, Rach, listen, I got a big date coming up.
Do you know a good restaurant?
Paul's Cafe. It's got great food and it's really romantic.
Great, thanks.
Then afterward you can take her to the Four Seasons for drinks.
Or go downtown and listen to some jazz.
Or dancing. Oh, take her dancing!
You sure are naming a lot of ways to postpone sex.
I miss dating. Getting all dressed up
and going to a fancy restaurant.
I won't be able to do that for so long.
And it's so much fun.
Not that sitting at home worrying about
giving birth to a sixteen pound baby is not fun.
Hey, you know what? Why don't I take you out.
What? Joey, you don't want to date a pregnant lady.
Yes, I do. We're gonna go out, we're gonna have a good time.
I'll take your mind off of childbirth, and Csections...
...and gaint baby heads stretching out...
Okay, I'll go with you. I'll go with you.
 It will be fun.  All right.
No, no! Yes!
Would you look at that, Monica.
I just knocked off all your top scores. How sad.
Okay, I'm next.
Don't start another game. I'm next! Phoebe?
Sorry, I couldn't hear you over all the winning.
Chandler, Phoebe's hogging the game.
Who cares? It's a stupid game.
You only think it's stupid because you suck at it.
I don't suck. It sucks.
You suck.
Wait okay, if this game
is gonna cause problems between the two of you,
then maybe I should just keep it.
No, I love it. It is a great present.
In fact, why don't you go home and wait for the thankyou card?
Why do you want to play this game so badly?
Yeah! It's not like it spits out a Clark bar after every game.
Okay. Phoebe, that's it. Come on, out of the chair.
Come on. Come on, out of the chair.
Phoebe!
Joey, could you get that?
Joey.
What are you doing here?
I thought you were in your room.
No, I'm picking you up for our date.
These are for you.
Lilies. They're my favorite. Thank you.
And a brownie.
Well, half a brownie.
Actually, it's just a bag.
It's a long walk from the flower shop
and I felt faint, so...
This is so great! I actually feel like I'm on a real date.
Although, I have a hint of morning sickness,
and I'm wearing underwear that goes up to about...
...there.
Hey, come on. This is a real date.
So nice place you got here.
Foosball. Pizza box.
Oh, a subscription to Playboy. My kind of woman.
That's my roommate's.
I'd like to meet him. He sounds like a standup guy.
But he's protective of me, so you'd better watch yourself.
So this roommate of yours, is he goodlooking?
Must be tough to keep your hands off him.
I'm pretty sure he's gay.
No! No, he's not! Why are you trying to ruin the game?
Come on.
Which brings us back, of course, to Greely's Theory of Dominance.
That's it for today.
Does anyone know where the Freeman Building is?
Yeah. It's the new building on Avenue A.
Waht? That's all the way across town.
I'm supposed to teach a graduate seminar there in ten minutes.
Dude, that's not gonna happen.
Move it! Move it! Move it!
Hey! I'm the teacher!
Hello.
Sorry I'm a little late. Whoa, a lot late.
Well, let me start by introducing myself.
I'm Professor Geller.
So to sum up...
...I'm Professor Geller. Good job today.
Now the filet mignon, what comes with that?
There's a side of steamed vegetables.
Instead of the vegetables...
...is there any way that I could substitute the...
...threepound lobster?
You know what? Bring her both.
And I'll have the same.
Wow, this is shaping up to be a pretty good date.
I almost forgot. I didn't pay you the rent check.
No roommate stuff, okay? We're on a date.
Okay. Wow, so I get to see what Joey Tribbiani is like on a date.
Do you have any moves?
No, I'm just myself,
and if they don't like me for...
I'm sorry, I couldn't even get through that.
I knew it. I knew it. Come, tell me your moves.
All right.
I usually start by having a bottle of wine
sent to my table from a fan.
Oh, my God. And that works?
Well, it does when you combine it with, "This is so embarrassing,
I just want to have a normal life!"
You poor little famous man.
Okay, how about this one?
I was gonna wait until the end of the night to kiss you...
...but you're just so beautiful, I don't think I can.
Oh, my God!
Wow, that was fantastic! I almost leaned in. I really almost did.
All right. So tell me one of your moves.
All right.
So where'd you grow up?
That's your move?
Boy, Rach, you're lucky you're hot.
 Come on, just answer the question.  Queens.
So were you close to your parents?
With my mom. Not so much my dad.
Why not?
I don't know. I guess there's just always been this distance.
I mean we both try to pretend it's not there, but it is.
It's gotta be rough.
Yeah, it's really tough. Sometimes I think...
Nice move!
"Where'd you grow up?" So simple.
Thank you.
Now, excuse me. I'm gonna use the restroom.
Now you're watching me walk away.
Yes, I am! Again, so simple!
You are not gonna believe what I did today.
It clearly wasn't showering or shaving.
I got good. I played this game all day, and now I rule at it.
They should change the name to "Ms. Chandler."
Although, I hope they don't.
Wait a minute. You stayed home and played Ms. PacMan
while I went to work like a chump?
I got all the top 10 scores. I erased Phoebe off the board.
Highfive!
What is the matter with your hand?
I've been playing it for like eight hours,
It'll loosen up. Come on. Check out the scores.
Also, look at the initials. They're dirty words.
Chandler, why would you do that?
Because it's awesome.
You think it's clever?
They only give you three letters,
so after ASS, it is a challenge.
This one's not dirty.
It is when you put it together with that one.
If you don't clear this off,
you won't get one of those from me.
Ben's coming over tomorrow to play this game. This can't be there.
Come on. He won't know what they mean.
Chandler, he's 7, he's not stupid.
Have you talked to him lately?
I'm gonna unplug it.
Nonono, if you unplug it, I'll have nothing to show for my day!
It would be like I was at work.
No!
Hey, look! It's still there!
This thing must have some kind of primitive ROM chip or something!
Honey, you gotta beat your scores.
With the claw?
Fine, I'll do it. I've just got to get this off the screen.
Carol's still upset that you taught him "Pull my finger." 
Pull my finger. My hand is messed up!
I am not gonna answer that.
Oh, come on. Just pick one.
Between Monica, Phoebe, Chandler and Ross...
...if you had to, if you had to,
who would you punch?
No one! We're friends. I wouldn't punch any of them.
Chandler?
Yeah, but I don't know why.
 I'm having such a wonderful time!  Me too!
 Rach, can I just say this is the best date I ever had.  I know!
I've never laughed so hard.
Did you see the wine come out of my nose?
Joey, I think everybody saw the wine come out of your nose.
I gotta say, I never knew I could enjoy
the nonsex part of a date so much.
That's because you have never been on a date with me before.
All right. Now don't judge me.
I normally wait till my date leaves,
but but you live here. I'm ripping into this swan.
Okay, then you don't judge me.
I'm gonna suck on the cellophane from that brownie I had before.
Oh, yeah.
So tell me,
what are Joey Tribbiani's endofthenight moves?
Well, if I want the girl to kiss me...
...first thing I do is make my lips look irresistible.
How do you do that?
Now you can't tell anyone, but...
...I put on shiny lip balm.
 Oh, my God.  Like a moth to a flame, I'm telling you.
Okay, all right, so, now you go.
No, I don't want to tell you.
 Why not?  Because it's embarrassing.
More embarrassing than shiny raspberry lip balm?
I didn't say raspberry before, did I?
Just tell me, Rach. Just tell me.
Okay.
All right, stand up.
Well, when we're at the door...
...I lightly press my lips against his.
Then move into his body, just for a second.
And then I make this sound:
It doesn't sound like anything, but I swear it works.
Oh, yeah. That would work, yeah.
All right, I gotta go to bed. Honey. I had such a wonderful time.
Me too.
You were 50 minutes late to the class, what did you crawl there?
No, I ran, okay? It's really far.
When did people stop understanding
the phrase "Get the hell out of my way"?
Why didn't you take a cab?
Between the traffic that time of day and all the oneway streets
it'd take me twice as long.
Besides, I teach the class three times a week.
Who am I, Rockefeller?
You won't be able to keep doing this.
I have to. If I don't, they'll take the class away from me.
And I put it in my family newsletter.
 Your what?  You've seen it, The Geller Yeller.
Right. Wow.
I think I figured out a much faster route.
I'm sure I can make it this time.
I just can't be afraid to get a little bit hit by cars.
Remember last night when we talked about Cujo?
Yeah, I still can't believe you haven't seen Cujo.
What is wrong with you?
Relax, it's not like it's Citizen Kane.
Have you ever sat through Citizen Kane?
Yeah, it's really boring. But it's, like, a big deal.
Anyway, I was thinking about renting Cujo sometime.
Yeah, all right. Well, let's do it tonight.
 Don't you have that big date tonight?  Oh, right.
 Hey, Joey, can I ask you something?  Yeah.
After our date last night, did you feel a little weird?
Oh, my God. You did too?
It totally freaked me out. What was that?
I don't know.
I'm kind of thinking it was the lobster.
Oh, yeah. Yeah, the lobster.
 I was up sick all night.  Me too. All night.
Really? How come we didn't cross paths?
Yeah, well, that's because...
...I stayed in my room.
You don't want to look in my hamper.
Okay, I got that.
I'll escape there. I'll come back here.
All right. Come on, Ms. PacMan.
Well, you're just a little bitch, aren't you?!
Hey, you guys?
I'm sorry that I was hogging the game before.
Oh, my God!
Your friends have some unfortunate initials.
They're all Chandler.
Chandler sucks. He couldn't get this good.
I did. But it came at a price.
Ben's coming over tonight, and he can't see this.
Come on. By age 7, kids have already seen orgies.
Was it just me?
Yes, I made it! I'm on time!
Okay, why don't we all...
...open our books to page 23...
...where...
...where you will see...
...a bunch of red spots.
Okay, why don't you all start to read while I...
Are you all right? You seem a little distracted.
No, no, I'm fine. It's just...
Hey, can I ask you something?
Have you ever looked at someone you know for a while
and suddenly seen them in a different way?
You mean like from behind?
Yeah. That's exactly it.
You know what? One time I saw this guy from behind
and he seemed like a totally normal guy
And then he turned around and it was Stephen Baldwin!
Yeah.
So you know exactly what I'm talking about.
Totally!
 Would you excuse me for a sec?  Yeah. Sure.
 Oh, my god. Phoebe! You're on fire!  I know!
One more score to go. You can do it!
 Don't touch me!  Don't touch her!
Go left! Go left! Go right! Go right!
I can't! I can't!
No! You son of a...
Phoebe?!
Oh, hi, Ben. No, don't look at the machine!
Thank God you're home! I'm watching Cujo.
 Alone?  Yes! What is wrong with this dog?
Did you get to the part where they're trapped in the car
and Cujo's throwing himself at the windshield?
No, seriously, what's wrong with the dog?
Wait a minute, what are you doing home so early?
What happened to your date?
Oh, it didn't work out.
Do you want to watch the rest of the movie with me?
Oh, okay. Yeah.
You know, I never thought I'd say this about a movie,
...but I really hope this dog dies.
What are you doing over there? Come sit here, you protect me.
Oh. Sure, yeah. Why not?
Okay.
Okay. That's him, that's him!
 That's Cujo! That's Cujo!  I know.
It's gonna be okay.
Oh, my God. What's he gonna do now? I can't watch.
Seriously, how can you watch this? aren't you scared?
Terrified.
So is everybody here?
I got here a little early, myself.
Let us begin.
Now, the hadrosaurids have been unearthed
in two main locations.
Here...
...and...
...here.
Now, as for the hydrosaurs...
All right, it's a new day.
All that stuff about Rachel?
You don't feel that now. It was crazy.
You're fine. You're better than fine.
You are, as your friend Tony would say, "Great!"
Everything's normal.
She's just your friend, Rachel.
Your friend, Rachel.
Your friend. Rachel.
Hi, sweetie.
Hey, it's your girlfriend, Rachel!
Friends S08E13 The One Where Chandler Takes a Bath
Are you...? Are you high?
I just had the most amazing bath.
Really? I don't like baths.
Wait. You like them with me.
Honey, it's not the bath I enjoy.
It's the wet, naked lady.
Baths are so relaxing.
Really? What do you do?
You just sit in there, stewing in your own filth.
How dirty do you think I am?
I'm telling you if you had some candles
and some bubbles and some music, you would love it.
It would take all of your stress away.
Honey, it's 2:00 on a Wednesday and I'm watching Road Rules.
How stressed do you think I am?
Hey, Chandler.
You got a minute? I really need to talk to you.
Oh, yeah. Is this a coldpizza talk
or a leftovermeat loaf talk?
Well, neither.
Oh, my God, what's up?
I don't know. It's just...
Lately, I've been feeling...
Okay, here's what it is.
You know what? I feel a lot better. Thanks.
Just come back.
Okay.
You and Monica, friends for a long time.
And sure, there are rules.
But then you went to London.
But that's different.
There are rules there too, you know what I mean?
Do you?
It was different for you guys.
I mean, you were both in the same place, right? 
 In London?  Yeah.
Yes, when Monica and I were in London, we were both in London.
You know what. This is a bad idea.
Forget it. Forget all about it.
And listen, do me a favor, this conversation between you and me.
If that.
Oh, Ross, don't forget we have that doctor's appointment tomorrow.
 Right.  Hey, are you going to find out the sex of the baby?
No. We talked about it. We don't wanna know.
All we care about is that it's happy and healthy.
Yep, happy and healthy. And cute.
 And smart.  Popular.
With an aptitude for science.
Are you two talking about the same baby?
Hey, have you thought of names yet?
Oh, yeah. I've come up with a bunch of ideas.
 Really? Me too.  Me too.
Really?
If it's a girl, Phoebe. And if it's a boy, Pheebo.
Maybe.
But it wouldn't hurt to have a backup, you know?
 Rach, what were you thinking?  Okay.
I was thinking if it's a girl...
...how about Sandrene? It's French.
That's a really pretty name for an industrial solvent.
Okay, fine. What do you have?
It's for a boy.
I know it's a little out there, but...
...Darwin.
Oh, my God. Our child will be beaten to death in the schoolyard.
Yeah, by Sandrene.
You're just saying that because I said no to your name.
I'm really, really not.
How about you each get five vetoes?
That sounds fair.
I don't think you'll need it though. Check this out.
If it's a girl, Rain.
Veto.
Why?
Rain? "Hi, my name is Rain.
I have my own kiln, and my dress is made out of wheat."
I know her!
I bought a homemade soap from her at a Dead show!
Okay. How about for a guy, Thatcher?
Ross, why do you hate our child?
 Fine, you go.  Okay. James.
 But only if it's a girl.  Veto.
How about... I like Ruth. What about Ruth?
Oh, I'm sorry. Are we having an 89yearold?
 How about Dayton?  Veto. Stewart.
Veto. Sawyer.
 Veto. Helen.  Veto.
Is it me, or is Veto starting to sound really good?
Boy, do I have a surprise for you.
Sex on the balcony?
No. But someone's really not gonna get over that idea, are they?
 What is it?  I drew you a bath.
I don't like baths.
Could you draw me a picture of us having sex on the balcony?
Please. Will you just try it for me. I used all my best stuff.
I lit some candles, I put on some music.
I used bath salts, plus bubble bath.
And got you this little plastic Navy ship!
So it's a boy bath.
This does butch it up a bit.
I swear, if you try it, you will love it.
If I do this,
can we at least discuss sex on the balcony?
Absolutely.
But I know how that discussiors gonna go.
All right, this isn't so bad.
I like the flowery smell.
Which is okay, because I've got my boat.
 So?  Oh, my God.
I told you you were a bath person.
Hey, when you get out, maybe I can give you a facial.
I'm gonna need a bigger boat.
I don't think you had an open mind about the name Ruth.
I mean, come on, little Ruthie Geller? How cute is that?
Oh, my God, I can practically hear the mahjong tiles.
Okay. All your tests look fine.
Are you two interested in knowing the sex of the baby?
No, we're not.
But you have it right there in that file?
You could tell us whether it's a boy or a girl?
Dayton or Sandrene? Phoebe or Pheebo?
That's right. But if you don't wanna know...
 No, we wanna wait. Right?  Right. Right.
Oh, I'll be right back.
I know it's really not my place...
...but please don't name your child Pheebo.
So which of these babies do you think is the ugliest?
What? Rach, come on, that's terrible.
They're babies. They're all beautiful.
Third one from the left?
Yeah. Why is it staring at me?
I think it knows I'm talking about it.
 Don't you...?  What?
You're looking!
 I didn't!  I saw you!
Fine, I did, but I didn't see anything. I swear.
Shame on you! Ugly baby judges you!
Okay. But Ross, listen to me, I didn't...
No, no. Don't tell me! I don't wanna know!
I couldn't even if I wanted to, because I don't know!
I swear I didn't see anything!
I don't want to know. It was just a momentary lapse.
Momentary lapse?
Don't you have any selfcontrol?
Okay. A couple months late on the lecture, Ross.
Hello?
I'm in the bathroom. Can you come in here?
I think there's something wrong.
You know what? I think I'll wait out here.
I'm in the bathtub.
What's wrong?
I drew my own bath, but I did it wrong.
The water's tepid, the salt didn't dissolve
and is now lodged places.
And the scents I used don't compliment each other.
Eucalyptus and chamomile?
 What?  Bath salts.
They're starting to effervesce.
It's different.
It's interesting.
Okay. Let's talk about something else.
Yeah. Sure. So, what was going on with you today?
I actually had the weirdest conversation with Joey.
He was talking about rules and right and wrong.
I had the exact same conversation.
You did? What was he talking about?
I don't know. Joey hasn't had this much trouble
getting out words since we saw him in Macbeth.
That was a long night.
All right, let's break this down.
What exactly did he say to you?
Okay. He was talking about rules
and looking at people differently.
He didn't say anything about that to me.
What'd he tell you?
He was asking all this questions about you, me and London.
And of course the glue that holds this all together, the rules.
Okay. So you, me and London.
Looking at people differently.
Maybe he wants to do what you and I did in London with someone.
But what'd he mean by "rules"?
Wait a minute. He stopped talking the minute Phoebe came in.
Because he was looking at her differently.
And Phoebe is his friend.
So he thinks that would be breaking the rules.
My God, he wants to do it with Phoebe in London!
 You guys?  Just a minute!
That's Mrs. Tribbiani.
You don't say anything.
Why would I say anything?
That two of our friends could start
the greatest love affair of their lives?
They would have me to thank.
Then we could all start having babies!
I'm not gonna let you say anything.
You just stay here.
Oh, God!
Hey, Monica, I brought back your iron.
Oh, you had that? I thought I lost it.
I got a new one a month ago.
Oh, just as well. I broke this one.
 What?  Nothing.
Okay.
I really shouldn't say. I'm really not supposed to.
Fine.
It's a humdinger.
Well, then it's really too bad that you can't tell me.
Somebody likes you!
Is it Chandler?
 No!  Then tell him to stop staring.
It's Joey.
Really? Joey? You don't say.
Is it something you'd be interested in?
I don't know, I don't know. I don't know.
You know, I mean, on the one hand, "Mother, may I?"
But, you know, on the other hand...
No. No, I can't. We're friends.
Oh, no. I don't wanna risk what we have.
I guess that makes sense.
You think you're gonna talk to him?
Sure. I mean, it's Joey.
I don't want him to get hurt.
Well, I must say, I am on fire!
First Chandler, now Joey.
 Not Chandler. Just Joey.  Sure.
You know what? I've been thinking about it.
I'm really coming around on the name Ruth.
I think I would actually consider naming our child that.
Rach, I can't tell you how much that means to me.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute. You hated the name Ruth.
Why would you change your mind?
Unless you know we're never gonna have to use it.
You did see the folder. You know it's a boy!
I didn't see anything.
I actually changed my mind about the name.
I don't think so. You're giving me Ruth...
...so you get to name him when it's a boy.
That's when you'll swoop in and name him Heath
or Blaine or Sequoia.
I would... Sequoia!
 Veto.  Fine.
Unless...
...you anticipated that I would figure all this out...
...and you know that it actually is a girl.
And you really do want her to be named Ruth.
Well, I'm not falling for that! Okay?
Ruth is off the table!
But, Ross, you want the name Ruth.
Not like this!
What's up?
 Joey, I know.  What?
 I know.  What?
I know about your feelings.
Oh, my God, did you?
Yes. I'm sorry. I know things worked out for Chandler and Monica,
but that's rare.
I know. And this is so much more complicated
than it was for those guys.
I mean, it's Rachel, for God's sakes.
For God's sakes, it's Rachel!
I know! She's not only my friend,
she's my pregnant friend.
She's my pregnant friend who's Ross' ex!
Yeah, that's Rachel.
Beat me over the head with it.
What am I gonna do?
I keep trying to get rid of these feelings.
I stayed up all last night
and made a list of everything I don't like about her.
 You wanna hear it?  Yeah.
"She made me switch to light mayo."
That's it! That's all I got!
You know what? Tastes the same and my pants fit better.
Joey, I think you're getting upset for nothing.
This is probably just a crush.
You think?
Absolutely. You get this rush of feelings,
but then it goes away.
Yeah, just a crush. That's all this is.
It's a crush!
I'm Joey. I don't get deep feelings.
Right. There you go. Crushes happen all the time.
I know I've had them for all you guys.
Except for Ross and Chandler.
 And I'm sure you've had them for us.  Not really.
Throw me a bone here.
So I called the doctor.
Now we both know the sex of the baby.
What?
That's right. The student has become the master.
Ross, I swear. I don't know.
Oh, come on, you know it's a girl.
A what?
You really didn't know?
 We're having a girl?  No.
 That's what you said.  No.
 You said girl.  Yes. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
I'm not! We're having a girl!
Sometimes I can't believe it's with you,
but still, we're having a girl!
I know! You know what?
I'm putting Ruth back on the table.
Yes, we'll have ourselves a little baby Ruth.
 Permission to veto.  Yes, please.
Do I smell essential oils?
Yeah. I'm gonna take a bath. I was just gonna get a magazine.
Okay.
What do you think you're doing?
Leaving my troubles behind?
I know that you're new at this,
but this is unacceptable bath decorum.
It's so hard to care when you're this relaxed.
Okay, fine. You can have the bath, but I am taking your boat.
Now you're just a girl in a tub.
Hi, bubbles. Manly.
I thought I would drop by
and let you know how it went with Joey.
You told her?
She pulled it out of me!
She's like a conversational wizard!
How did it go?
 You were wrong. He doesn't like me.  What?
Yeah. How would you like it if I sent you to Lee Majors' house...
...and I told you he liked you and you went there...
...and you found out that he didn't like you.
How would you feel?
I don't think I'd care.
Really? Lee Majors is hot.
 Hello?  We're in the bathroom!
 Why?  Because it's a relaxing and enjoyable time!
 What are you guys doing in here?  Oh, my God.
A friend he's looking at differently, but it's wrong.
 It's Rachel!  You like Rachel?
Look. It's no big deal, okay? Phoebe and I talked about it.
It's just a crush. It's gonna go away.
Dude, you gotta rearrange your bubbles.
Mazel tov.
Ross and I were looking for you.
What are we all doing in here? Oh, my.
Honey, cover it up with the boat.
Hello?
Yes. We're all in here, and we'd love for you to join us!
Well, hey! What's going on?
Oh, cool boat. Oh, no.
 Did you tell them?  No. I was waiting for you.
 Tell us what?  We're having a girl.
Oh, wow! Really?
I'll get you later.
All right. It's a new day.
And it's just a crush.
That's all. Just a little crush.
All that worrying I was doing? That was crazy. Crazy.
Like my friend the bird here would say, "It was cuckoo!" 
Everything's gonna be fine. It's just a crush.
 Hi, sweetie.  I love you.
It's nice to do this together, isn't it?
Yeah. And what you're doing feels so good.
I'm not touching you.
 You're not?  It's the salts.
Oh, sweet Lord, new realms of pleasure.
Whatever keeps you off the balcony, big guy.
What's up?
I left my guitar here again.
 Okay. No problem.  Okay.
Okay. Here you go.
 Okay.  Okay.
 What?  You want to hang out or something?
Phoebe. You caught me at a bad time.
 Are you and Chandler...?  Yes. Exactly.
 Okay. Do you guys want me to play for you?  No.
Hey, Pheebs, what's up?
You ask an intriguing question, Chandler Bing.
Oh, my God! You're getting a massage?
You never let me massage you.
Phoebe, I can explain.
You told me you hate massages.
Buy stamps. Pick up dry cleaning.
Don't let Phoebe in.
I can't believe this! How long has this been going on?
Well, Alexandra has...
It has a name?
Phoebe, don't get upset.
Okay. Oh, too late! I'm leaving.
Come on, Chandler, let's go.
Well, I thought I'd...
Yeah, what the hell.
Friends S08E14 The One With The Secret Closet
Oh okay, okay! One more push! One more push!
Come on honey, we're almost there! We're almost there!
Joey, I'm happy things worked out for us
and we're having this baby together.
I love you so much.
I love you too.
I hope it's not an inappropriate time to say this...
...you're the best sex I've ever had.
That's always appropriate.
Okay, come on, one more push. One more push.
There we go.
Here is your beautiful baby.
Congratulations.
I hope you're a better father than you are a friend!
 Joey! Joey!  What?
 What's going on?  Come feel my belly.
The baby's kicking for the first time.
Will you please come feel this?
 Really?  Yes.
You know what? Maybe you...
Maybe you should come to me. I'm not wearing any bottoms.
Oh, my God.
It's unbelievable!
Wow, she is kicking so much. She's like...
Who's that kind of annoying girl soccer player?
 Mia Hamm?  Mia Hamm!
 It's amazing.  One hand on the sheet, Joe.
Sorry.
 Hey, babe.  Hey, honey.
We got a wedding gift from Bob and Faye Bing.
They don't like us, do they?
Who says you can't get a nice punch bowl for under $6?
Maybe we can take it back.
No, it doesn't say where it came from. Where would we return it?
How about to the street, from the balcony?
Why don't we just find a place for it?
How about that cabinet?
No. That's for canned goods.
Have you forgotten everything you learned at orientation?
How about the closet by the bathroom?
 Okay. Let me do it.  No, I'll do it.
Honey, you have to learn to sit down and relax
and let your husband take care of things once and awhile.
It's locked. You have to help me.
Why is it locked?
No reason. I keep private things in there.
I've been here a while,
and I've never seen what's inside that closet.
What is in there?
Feminine stuff.
Don't try to make me uncomfortable with feminine stuff!
Chandler, there is nothing in there that concerns you!
If you love me, you'll just let it go.
 Fine.  Thank you.
Love you.
Hello, Chandler. Lovely day, huh?
You.
Phoebe, if it helps,
Alexandra's only been massaging Monica for three years.
If! I said, if it helps.
Why won't you let me massage you?
I mean I'd just... I'd be selfconscious.
You're my friend. I'd be naked.
Monica, we lived together for years.
I've seen you naked.
That's different. We were roommates.
And when?
I'm curious about the human body.
Come on, Phoebe. You can understand why this would be weird for me.
I'm a professional and I'm really good.
If you're uncomfortable, we can stop.
Just give me a chance. Please? Okay?
Okay. If it means that much to you.
It does.
How would you feel if you couldn't share your cooking?
Or imaging how Ross would feel
if he couldn't teach us about dragons.
 Dinosaurs.  Potato, potahto.
Ross, the baby's kicking.
What? It is?
It's not kicking right now.
Although we would love to see you do that again.
When? When was it kicking? What happened?
Last night. I just felt it and I went into Joey's room,
 and he was sleeping.  A dreamless sleep.
My God, the baby's kicking. That's great.
Although I kind of wish I would have been there to feel
the kicking for the first time.
I got some stuff going on if you want to feel.
Look, I don't want to miss any more baby stuff.
So here's my pager number, okay?
Anytime anything pregnancyrelated happens, use it.
I'll be there. I don't care if it's three in the morning,
and all you want is ice cream.
Can I get a copy of that?
 Are you under the sheet?  Yes.
Great, let's begin.
How's the pressure?
It's nice. Wow, Phoebe, you are good.
Stating the obvious, but thank you.
 And it's not weird, is it?  No.
That's right, you just enjoy.
Oh, yeah!
 Oh, yeah!  Okay.
Oh, God, Phoebe!
That's it! That's it, right there!
I wasn't trying to open your closet.
I wasn't trying to open your closet, I swear.
Monica runs a pretty tight ship here, doesn't she?
What are you doing?
Monica has a secret closet. She won't let me see what's in it.
 Why not?  I don't know!
What could she possibly be hiding in here that I can't see?!
I don't know.
I bet it's Richard.
Why would Monica be keeping Richard in here?
Off the top of my head...
...maybe she's having her cake and eating it too.
You being the "cake," Richard being the "too."
 Or...  And here we go.
I saw this movie once where there was a door
Nobody knew what was behind it.
When they finally got it open,
millions and millions and millions of bugs came pouring out
and they feasted on human flesh.
It wouldn't kill you to respect your wife's privacy!
Stupid closet full of bugs!
Joey. Joey, something feels weird and not good weird.
I don't...
Do not worry, ok?
When my sisters were pregnant...
they got every weird feeling in the book,
and it was always nothing.
 Really?  Absolutely.
But we'll stop by the hospital just to be sure.
 I'll page Ross on the way.  Okay. God!
Okay Rach, Rach, Rach look at me, look at me,
everything's gonna be fine, trust me. Okay.
Come on. Take my hand. Here we go.
Crushing bones!
Good thing we're going to a hospital.
 So?  She's fine.
She's experiencing BraxtonHicks contractions,
mild discomfort caused by contractions in the uterine wall.
Mild discomfort?
So I take it you've had one of these Braxton thingies?
 But everything's normal?  Absolutely.
 And there's no danger to her or the baby?  No.
Contractions can be unnerving if you don't know what they are,
but she's fine.
Thank you, doctor.
And thank you for being nice and calm.
Calm? I wasn't calm!
I've never been more scared in my entire life.
But wait you said everything was gonna be okay.
What do I know? I'm not a doctor.
 But everything is okay. I'm fine.  You sure?
Yes. I got half a mind to contract that doctor's uterus though.
Mild discomfort! What's he talking about?
 Is everything okay?  Yes, everything's fine.
Your page said, "Come to the hospital." What happened?
Something called Braxton Hicks contraction.
Thank god. That's no big deal.
Most women don't feel them.
No uterus, no opinion.
 What's with the candy?  When you beeped me,
I was at the concession stand at the movie theater.
 You went to the movies by yourself?  Mona!
I gotta go back in there.
Why? What's wrong?
No, everything's fine. I just gotta go back...
No, really, tell me. What's up?
Look, I forgot my underwear.
Thanks so much for bringing her to the hospital.
Don't worry about it. No big deal.
But still, it should have been me. I'm the dad.
If you have any questions,
 Here's information on Braxton Hicks.  Thanks.
By the way, you did the right thing by bringing her in.
You'll make a wonderful father.
Hey, not as good as this guy. He brought Twizzlers.
There has got to be a way.
Easy there, Captain Kirk.{\r}\N{\fnTahoma\fs10\bord1\shad1\1c&HC0C0C0&\b0}
 Do you have a bobby pin?  Yeah.
Oh, no, wait. I'm not a 9yearold girl.
Then why do you throw like one?
Maybe Monica has a bobby pin.
Oh, sure, "Monica."
So, how's the hideously inappropriate crush on Rachel coming?
Really good. I should be ready to kill myself any day now.
Well, you sure found that quick.
I wish I didn't feel this way about Rachel any more.
I wish things could go back to normal.
I love living with her,
and helping out with the baby is amazing.
But now I think Ross feels left out.
When I took Rachel to the hospital,
the doctor thought I was the father.
You should have seen the look on Ross' face.
By the way, I have no idea what I'm doing here.
For all I know, I'm just locking it more.
Did you try opening it with a credit card?
 That's a good idea.  Okay.
So Ross is kind of bummed, huh?
 I feel terrible.  It's not your fault.
What are you gonna do, not take her to the hospital?
You're doing nothing wrong.
Except for harboring an all consuming love
for the woman whose carrying his baby.
Richard, if you're in there,
could you pass me my credit card?
I gotta tell you, yesterday was amazing.
That massage felt so good.
No, I got that.
So, what do you say we make it a weekly appointment?
Okay.
You should know though, I've raised my rates to $200 an hour.
 Okay.  I mean 500.
 What?  600.
What's going on?
You make sex noises when you get massaged.
 What?  Yeah, and it really freaked me out!
And after a while I even tried to hurt you
and it just spurred you on.
What? You're crazy.
There's nothing sexual about the noises I make.
Really? There's nothing sexual about this?
Oh, God!
What are you looking at?
I mean, hi.
This is so embarrassing.
Oh, my god. I'm never getting a massage again.
No, you can't let this stop you from getting massages.
Look, I have lots of clients
that make the same noises as you do.
 Really?  Well, not clients. Lovers.
We'll try it again.
Come back, and we'll work through it.
 You sure?  Yes.
 I guess.  Great! Now, if you'll just excuse me.
So did you hear something you liked?
Hey, Ross, check it out! I learned a new trick.
Hey, I brought you some lunch.
Oh, that's so sweet of you. Oh, yum.
 Did you put pickles on this?  Well, yeah.
What? What? Rach, what?
What's going on?
I made her favorite, tuna salad with pickles.
Pickle? Pickle makes her sick.
Giving her pickle is like giving me salad.
I'm sorry Rach, I didn't know. Are you gonna be okay?
Yeah, I'll be fine,
But could someone please make sure that sandwich is gone
 when I get out there?  I'm on it!
I can't believe this.
I shouldn't be the one making her throw up.
Relax, Ross. It could happen to anyone.
Yeah, not to you. 'Cause you know this stuff.
I don't know any of it and I'm the father.
I wish I could be more involved, you know?
Well, if anyone is keeping score,
I no longer eat tuna.
Can I talk to you guys for a second?
 Yeah.  What's up?
Sit down. I wanna talk about our situation.
Are you breaking up with us?
The thing is...
...because I live with Rachel, I'm here for a lot of stuff.
And Ross is missing everything. So...
Yeah?
Maybe you two should live together.
Are you asking me to move out? You don't want me here?
No, I love living with you. It just seems that...
...if you're gonna have a roommate, it may as well be the father.
But, Joey, I don't think Ross wants me to move into his apartment
and disrupt his life like that.
Or he does.
I would love to be around for you and the baby.
We can just try it, like on a temporary basis.
But Ross, it's you and me.
Sure, but it wouldn't be anything romantic.
I'm dating Mona. Damn it, Mona!
I was supposed to meet her an hour ago.
What is wrong with me?
So, what do you think?
 I don't know. Is it crazy?  No, no, it's not...
Joey, this is a smart idea.
Well, I was due.
Okay, let's do it. I'll move in.
 Really?  Yeah.
Rach, that's great. That's great.
Not too shabby. I got this all off myself...
...using my wife's tools.
Oh, my God.
How did you get in there?
You're messy.
No! You weren't supposed to see this!
I married Fred Sanford.
No, Chandler, you don't understand.
Okay, okay, fine! Now you know, okay?
 I'm sick.  No, honey, you're not sick.
Look, I don't love you because you're organized.
I love you in spite of that.
Really?
 Promise you won't tell anyone?  Yes.
And look, now that I know if I got some extra stuff lying around,
can we share the closet?
Well... It's just...
I'm afraid you might mess it up.
So Rachel's all moved out? How you taking it?
I wanted to have a few beers, but I got rid of those
because Rachel couldn't stand the smell of them.
I have thrown back a lot of orange juice with calcium.
It's a couple weeks past its expiration date,
so it's got a bit of a kick.
Are you okay?
You kidding me? Yeah, I'm great.
I'm better than great. I am good.
Now that she's gone,
I can do stuff around here that I couldn't do before.
Like...
I can walk around naked again.
I can...
I can watch porn in the living room.
This is good for me.
I like being on my own. I'm better off this way.
I'm a lone wolf.
A loner. Alone.
All alone. Forever.
What's a wolf gotta do to get a hug around here?
That's it, just relax.
 Come on, more.  Oh, God!
You like that, don't you?
Yeah, right there.
Want it there? Take it there, baby.
 Phoebe?  Yeah, say my name. Say it.
And now I'm going to cover you back up.
And I won't be speaking with you for several weeks.
Hey, Rach!
 Happy Valentine's Day!  You too!
Hey, so, uh, how's it going living over at Ross'?
It's good,
except he makes us watch the Discovery Channel all day long.
Did you know that something really boring happened
to someone ugly in the Middle Ages.
Oh, thank you. I'll see you guys later.
 Okay, bye.  Bye.
That is one lucky togo cup of coffee.
Honey, I wish you would get over her.
I hate seeing you like this.
Is there anything I can do for you?
Do you wanna look down my top?
Thanks. Maybe later.
 Gunther, can I get a scone?  You want anything?
You know what I want? I want a lot of things.
I wanna be with the woman I love on Valentine's Day.
I want her to love me back.
And I want just one moment of relief from the gutwrenching pain
of knowing that that's never going to happen!
We have red bagels.
Okay.
Friends S08E15 The One With The Birthing Video
So, how does Mona feel about you and Rachel living together?
Oh, I'm actually on my way to tell her right now.
Yeah, she's been away all week visiting her parents,
but she'll be cool. She's been so supportive.
She even got the baby a tiny Tshirt that says
"Fossils are my friends."
Come on, Mona. Don't kiss ass.
So I'm gonna take off.
Oh, shoot! Oh, shoot! Rachel wanted to see this tape.
 What is it?  It’s a video of my friend giving birth.
Could you take it to your apartment?
"Candy and Cookie"?
Yeah. Candy's the mom, Cookie's the daughter.
The father's name is also Cookie.
Why am I friends with these people?
Phoebe, come here.
I wanna show you something in the bathroom.
Monica, grow up.
What's behind your back?
Nothing. Just...
Just something I want Phoebe's opinion on for Valentine's Day.
 You don't want my opinion?  Not really.
Come on, I'm your older brother. Ask me.
Okay, big brother.
Which of these do you think would make
your little sister look hotter,
so your best friend would want to do her?
The red one.
Look, I know you've been really depressed lately,
so I brought someone to cheer you up.
Right outside is a real, live, furry playmate.
No, I'm not sleeping with your friend Jane again.
Hey, a dog!
Who, you gotta admit, looks a lot like Jane.
This is the happiest dog in the world.
I borrowed him from my friend Wendy.
So you can keep him till he cheers you up.
And he will cheer you up!
Thanks so much, Pheebs. We are gonna have so much fun!
Yes, we are. Oh, not that kind of fun.
Happy Valentine's!
I'll be right out.
I'm slipping into something a bit less comfortable
and a bit more slutty.
"Candy and Cookie"?
"Candy and Cookie"?!
Monica got me porn?
Girlongirl porn?!
She really must love me!
Yeah, just relax.
I love you, St. Valentine.
Whoa, whoa, that's not pretty.
Now push!
Oh, God, it hurts!
Worst porn ever! Worst porn ever!
 Oh, make it stop!  I am trying!
Get the ball. Ready? Get the ball!
You're cute, but you're not too smart.
Did I just throw this?
I accidentally packed these with my stuff.
 Who is this?  That's Phoebe's friend's dog.
I don't know what his real name is. I call him Mozzarella.
You are so cute. I wish I could play with you more,
but I've gotta go to work.
I hope I stop talking like this before my market meeting.
Yes, I do. Yes, I do.
Byebye, Joey. Seriously, I can't stop it.
Come here! Hey!
That's Rachel. She's the one who used to live here.
Might as well be honest with you. We love her.
But we can't have her.
I really miss her.
Hey, you understand, right? You're a guy.
Well, you used to be.
So, what do you think?
I've still got it.
 Why did you get me this?  What is it?
It's yelling, bleeding, dilating.
Oh, the dilating!
Is this the video of the baby being born?
Sweetie, It's Phoebe's. Why were you watching it?
I thought maybe you got me porn for Valentine's Day.
Chandler, If you thought I was gonna get you porn for Valentine's Day...
...you were right.
Apparently It's about a young girl
who moves to the city in search of stardom...
...but ends up having sex with a lot of guys.
It got four stars.
Wait a minute. Those aren't stars.
Anyway, you wanna take a look?
I'm not really in a sexy mood right now.
Hey, what's going on?
Remember the first time you saw Jaws...
...how long it took to go back in the water?
We can't let this tape wreck Valentine's Day.
Okay. You don't know. You didn't see it.
Childbirth is a natural thing. It's beautiful.
Oh, beautiful? Really?
Really? You think this is beautiful?
Oh, my God! No wonder my mother hates me!
 See, honey, there's...  Don't touch me!
 How was Atlantic City?  Good.
I brought you back a present.
Come, on. You didn't have to...
Saltwater taffy?!
Thanks.
You know, it's interesting,
most people think this is made with seawater.
But it's actually made with salted fresh water.
That's not interesting.
 I think it's interesting.  I do too. I missed you!
Me too.
 So how was your week?  Good.
 Actually, the baby started kicking.  How exciting!
Yeah. it was amazing. The only thing sad is,
I wasn't around when it happened for the first time.
 Oh, no.  Yeah. I was missing out on all this other stuff too.
So Joey suggested Rachel move in with me.
Yeah, right.
 What?  Joey cracks me up.
It's like, "Yeah, why don't you have your exwife move in with you?
That wouldn't be awkward at all."
Can you imagine, I go away for a few days...
I come back and my boyfriend
is living with some woman he got pregnant.
So, what'd you tell him?
How could you not tell Mona that Rachel is living with you?
I don't know. She seemed to think it was such a crazy idea.
Plus, she got me taffy.
 Taffy? Really? I've never had any.  Ever?
My mom was too busy planning her suicide to provide saltwater treats.
Thank you.
So what, you're just never going to tell her?
No, no, no. I will. I just want to butter her up first.
I'm going to take her to an amazing Valentine's dinner,
do all this romantic stuff.
And then just when she thinks I'm the best boyfriend in the world,
then I'm gonna tell her my pregnant exgirlfriend is living with me.
If I haven't said it before, she's a lucky, lucky lady.
So where are...? What the mother of crap is up with this stuff?
God, is it gum? Is it food? What's the deal?
Oh, it's nice. May I try a pink one?
So between her and me being friends,
and her history with Ross...
...it just isn't gonna happen.
It'd be like you falling in love with a cat.
Buddy, how's my favorite dog, huh?
How's my favorite dog?
You're subdued.
 Did you give him a beer?  No.
Will you excuse us? We need to talk for a moment.
Yeah, sure.
Oh, me, right.
 He's miserable. What happened to him?  Nothing.
 We just talked about stuff.  What stuff?
Rachel stuff.
Oh, Joey, you bummed him out!
This is the happiest dog in the world.
And he spends half a day with you, and look at him!
He's breathing.
Okay, I'm going to take him back to Wendy's.
No, no, no. He's fine. Look, look, look.
Here's your ball! Get your ball!
Get your ball! Get your ball! Get your ball!
Get...
God, what have I done to you?
I broke the dog, Pheebs! I broke the dog!
I'm going to pick up Mona. What have you got going tonight?
Oh, I got big Valentine's plans.
I got my Chinese food on the way,
and the rest of your saltwater taffy.
It's interesting! Most people think that's made with seawater,
 when in fact...  Ross,
we actually watched the documentary together.
Oh, my Chinese food. I'll get my cash.
Mona?
What are...? Hi!
What are you doing here? I'm supposed to pick you up.
Change of plans. I made you a special Valentine's dinner.
Surprise!
 Oh! Hey, Mona!  Hi, Rachel.
What's she doing here?
I have no idea.
I'll be watching TV if anybody needs me.
Seriously, what is she doing?
Lately she just likes hanging out here.
 Why?  I think she's lonely.
Okay, but it's Valentine's Day.
 I know.  Can't we ask her to go?
Well, no, she's way too emotional.
And by emotional, I mean crazy!
I'm not here. That's just my Chinese food.
Oh, my god. She has food delivered here?
Yes, she's emotional, but ballsy.
You know what I'm going to do?
I'm gonna get in my sweats and eat this in bed.
And you thought she was gonna be in our way!
So, okay. Why don't you open the champagne,
and I will be right back. I've got a surprise for you.
You got another exwife back there?
Please start drinking.
 I'm just gonna grab the phone.  Rachel, wait.
I hope you don't take this the wrong way.
But, what are you doing?
Sorry, do you need the phone?
No, no.
Listen, Ross is too nice to say anything,
but this is his apartment.
and, we gotta have some boundaries,
so why don't you go back to your place and give us some privacy?
But, Mona, I live here.
Happy Valentine's Day!
Or, something to remember me by.
 How long has it been this time?  90 seconds.
That's better.
Ninety seconds is a long time not to think about it.
Except all I did was think about it.
I know. It haunts me.
Up till now, the worst thing I ever saw,
was my father doing tequila shots off the naked houseboy.
After this, I would gladly make that my screen saver.
We have to get past this.
Why don't we get rid of the tape and pretend it never existed?
 I could do that.  Okay.
Okay. Now all we gotta do is get rid of this chair.
 Oh, thank God!  I know.
Come in!
Hi. I'm so sorry to barge in on your Valentine, but...
I had to get away from the yelling.
Mona's dumping Ross.
 Oh, my God.  Poor Ross.
Great, we have to watch him do yoga in his underwear,
but for this he closes the drapes.
Rach, you know that birthing tape you wanted to see?
It's here.
We should warn you before you watch it.
Don't watch it.
You saw it? Is it scary?
Well, let's just say that it's ironic how footage
of someone being born can make you want to kill yourself.
Now I'm all freaked out. Come on, will you watch it with me?
No, but I'll leave a sweater that smells like me
right next to you.
Seriously, you guys, you're not gonna make me watch this alone.
She's right. Of course not.
Honey, get the tape.
This reminds me of a very specific part of the tape.
Here we go.
Okay.
Oh, my.
 Come on, come on.  Why is that baby torturing that woman?
Why have I seen this thing three times?
It's still beautiful.
It's horrible!
 I know, I know! I'm so sorry for you!  Oh, my god.
You guys! You guys, look!  What? Did her ass explode?
No, the baby's out. Look, look.
Look at those little fingers and toes.
Look how happy the mom is now.
 Oh, Rach.  Screw you guys!
You don't have to do it!
 What's up?  Mona just dumped me.
Oh, man, I'm sorry. Why?
Well, with everything that's been going on lately,
I haven't exactly been the perfect boyfriend.
I didn't tell her I got Rachel pregnant.
I gave her a key to my apartment and then had the locks changed.
Then I lied to her about Rachel moving in with me.
In a way, I judge her for not breaking up with me sooner.
That really sucks, man.
 Especially on Valentine's Day.  Yeah.
Wait a minute. What are you doing here?
Joey Tribbiani without a date on Valentine's Day?
What's going on, huh? Girl trouble?
 Sort of.  Really?
You don't have to seem so happy about it.
Sorry. Maybe I can help.
Whatever it is, I am sure it has happened to me.
You know, actually, once I got dumped during sex.
So anyway, what is it?
Forget about it. It's no big deal.
 Come on, Joey, what is it?  It's nothing.
Hey, it's me. Why can't you tell me?
Okay. Sit down.
There's this woman that I like a lot.
But it can't happen.
She's not a Tribbiani?
No!
So is she someone from work?
Yes.
Well, does she like you?
Sometimes I think maybe she could.
But it doesn't matter, because I can't do anything about it.
Why not?
It's complicated.
She was with this other guy for a long time.
Someone from work too.
And I could never do that to the guy,
because we're really good friends.
So this guy she used to go out with,
is he still in love with her?
 No, I don't think so.  Okay.
Is he a good guy?
Yeah, he's the best.
Then talk to him.
 He might be fine with it.  I don't know.
Joey, come on, it's worth finding out, if you really like her.
I do, so much.
I can't stop thinking about her. I can't sleep...
Okay, Joey, you know what? You have to go for it.
How often does this happen to you?
You owe it to yourself.
Here's your warm milk.
I'm gonna put the bourbon in it at home.
Anyway, seriously, just talk to the guy, okay?
Let me know how it goes.
It's Rachel.
You're having a baby and you need to be prepared.
You're gonna make yourself watch the whole thing. Just do it!
I came to the big city to become a star.
I'll do anything to make that happen.
Anything?
Maybe it starts with how she gets pregnant.
I'm sorry, did you just say it's Rachel?
Yes.
You like Rachel?
Yes. I like Rachel.
Rachel?!
Yeah. Okay, but look, you know...
You know who else I like? You.
And it doesn't get said enough. I like you, Ross.
 "Rachel" Rachel?  It's not a big deal.
It's not a big deal? I'm sorry, I just...
What about the stuff you said?
How you can't stop thinking about her?
How you can't sleep?
I'm an actor, you know?
As a group, we tend to be overdramatic.
Rachelwho'scarryingmybaby Rachel?
I know it's bad. And I know it's wrong, okay?
But it's not like anything's ever gonna happen.
These are just feelings. They'll go away.
You know, I gotta go.
Hey, come on, Ross...
I just... You know, I just have one... Rachel?!
Rachel?!
Rachel?!
Friends S08E16 The One Where Joey Tells Rachel
Okay, she's kicking.
She's growing inside you.
That was a big one.
I think that's the youngest girl ever to reject me.
 You guys!  Hey there.
Listen let me ask you. Do you believe in soul mates?
Oh, yes, I do.
I do. I believe that there is one perfect person
out there for everyone.
You know how you find him? You stop looking for him.
That's why I stopped looking for Russell Crowe.
He'll find me.
And you?
No. I believe that certain people are more suited for each other,
and I believe in falling in love, but...
 Soul mates? I don't think they exist.  Okay, good.
 Why?  Well, last night, I met Monica's.
 What?  Yeah.
I had a date with this guy.
And I swear to god he's her other half.
Come on, don't be crazy. You don't think there's somebody out there
better suited for Monica than me, do you?
Well, what's he like?
 He's tall. He has brown hair.  Of course.
A tall guy with hair similar to mine?
Oh, unknowable universe!
He works with food.
Oh, sure. Older?
Obviously. And he's British.
 I was just gonna ask!  Yeah.
And he's so centered, and mature and confident.
It's so sad they never had a chance to meet.
Luckily, the guy she settled for can't hear what you're talking about.
Oh, I'm so sorry. Maybe I'm wrong.
I'm gonna go out with him again. I'll find out more.
You believe that this guy is destined for someone else
and you're still gonna date him?
He may not be my soul mate, but a girl's gotta eat.
I just talked to Joey. I wanted to see you how you were.
I still can't believe it. Joey and Rachel?
It's like you and me going out, only weirder.
I know you're hurting, and I want to be supportive,
...but don't say that again.
Oh, my god. What if they get married?
He'd be the stepfather of my child.
Honey, I don't think that's something we need to worry about!
First of all, he'll never tell her how he feels about her.
And even if he did, you have no idea how she'd react.
Sure, women never like Joey. I think he's a virgin.
 Joey isn't even thinking about going after Rachel.  He's not?
No, all he's thinking about is how you're taking this.
Listen, it's completely freaking him out.
He's talking about moving to Vermont.
 Why?  He says he wants to leave the country.
He thinks you hate him.
Hate him?
No, I don't hate him.
It's just, it's Rachel. You know?
I can't even imagine how hard this must be for you...
...but I don't want you to lose Joey over it.
Right now, he just needs to know that you're still his friend.
Okay, I'll talk to him.
Do it soon.
He just asked me how to convert his dollars into Vermont money.
 Chandler, Monica, this is Don.  Hello.
Hello, nice to meet you.
 How are you?  Soul mate.
So, what have you guys been doing?
Well, we just had a terrible lunch today at Adriatica.
What's with the sundried tomatoes in that place?
I know! Is this 1985?
That's exactly what I said. Phoebe, isn't that strange.
Not really.
What's wrong with sundried tomatoes?
On a barbecuedchicken pizza?
No?
So, Don. What other restaurants do you like?
Octavio. 27and7.
There's this great little place, Alessandro's.
Oh, my God! That's my restaurant, I'm the chef there.
You're kidding me! Your food is fantastic!
I really want to talk about your menu,
once I get some coffees first. Um, anyone want any?
Oh, I'd like a latte.
You know what? If you're gonna talk about me,
I'm gonna go with you.
What are you doing?
Nothing. I swear to god, I didn't know you guys would be here.
And the good news is you don't even believe in soul mates, so...
I believe in tall, handsome strangers who hit on my wife.
They're just talking, and you know what?
Just because I think they're soul mates
doesn't mean anything'll happen.
Phoebe? Good work.
He's great. I love him.
Don't worry, we'll find you someone else.
I understand if you came by to hit me. I deserve it.
No, I don't want to hit you.
What, then? Kick me?
No.
Bite me?
I don't want to do anything to you.
I just want to tell you that I'm not mad at you...
...and that I certainly do not hate you.
I just came here to say that.
Hey, wait, Ross, Ross?
You wanna come in for a beer or something?
Yeah, sure.
You got any beer?
All I got is melon stuff that Rachel left.
Okay.
Look, Ross. You need to understand something, okay?
I...
I am never gonna act on this Rachel thing, okay?
I wouldn't do anything to jeopardize my friendship with you.
Thank you.
Anyway, it'll just...
It'll take me a while to get over her, that's all.
I'm not even sure how to do that,
I mean I've never been in love before, so...
What?
You're in love with her?
 Yeah. I thought you knew that.  No.
Look, if it helps,
I don't want to feel this way, honest.
I just keep thinking,
"I'll get over this," you know?
But it just keeps getting harder.
I don't know what to do, you know?
I don't... What do I do?
I think you need to tell her how you feel.
Okay, that's the green stuff talking.
No, I'm serious. You need to find out where she is.
Because if she's not where you are,
then you can start to move past this.
But what if, and I'm not saying she will be...
If she is where you are, then...
...then my feeling weird shouldn't stand in the way.
 Are you sure?  Yeah.
Look, if she's gonna end up with somebody else...
...the truth is, she couldn't find a better guy, so...
Hey, thanks.
So when do you think you're gonna talk to her?
Oh, my God. I have to tell her.
I haven't thought about what I will say. What should I say?
I'm understanding, but let's not get carried away.
I'm sorry. Sorry.
What am I gonna say?
Yeah, tell me about it.
So I've been slowly phasing out the wine importing
and focusing more on the cheese side of things.
Cheese, you say?
That's some pretty smelly work, huh, Don?
 Excuse me?  Cheese. It's smelly.
You must smell a lot of the time too.
Not really. But when it comes to cheese,
I'm one of the people who thinks the smellier, the better.
Me too! Chandler can't stand it.
He won't even allow me to have blue cheese in the house.
And you're still married to him?
You know what I'd love to do?
I would like to go to France and eat nothing but bread and cheese.
Not even bread. Just cheese.
No, I want the bread.
And pastries.
And pate.
I'm really not high. It's just I used to be fat.
Well if you where ever enter the Loire valley let me know,
I've got a great little villa you can stay at.
Is it made of cheese?
No. A house made of cheese, wouldn't that be incredible?
 I'd move in tomorrow!  Oh, come on!
 Are you listening to this!  I'm so sorry.
 What do we do?  I don't know.
They both want to live in a house of cheese.
I don't know how you fight that.
Okay, okay. I can do this.
I can tell her how I feel.
Okay, stand up straight.
Take a couple deep breaths.
Look confident.
Joey? What's up?
I just came by because I want to talk to you about something.
Okay. What's up?
Here, in the hall? What are we, animals?
I'm late for a meeting. Could you make it quick?
I just came by to tell you that...
...I want to have dinner with you tonight.
Sure. That sounds great!
Just leave me a message and tell me where to meet you. Okay?
Okay. That's good.
Okay, that give you a couple hours
to prepare what you're gonna say. Good. Yeah.
Don't you people ever knock?
I'd like to have Don and Phoebe over.
Wouldn't that be nice?  Sure. Why don't you set it up?
I'll just be over here browsing through the personals.
Are you okay? You're acting weird all afternoon.
Yeah. Fine. Not perfect.
But good enough.
Jeez, what's with you?
I'm sorry, did you say "cheese"?
All right. What's going on?
Phoebe thinks you and Don are soul mates.
I don't believe in that kind of stuff,
but then you two totally get along.
So, look, I won't stand in your way if you wanna run off with Don
and live in a house of cheese.
Chandler, you don't believe in soul mates?
No, but I'm sure "tomahtoes" does.
I don't believe in soul mates, either.
 You don't?  Nope.
I don't think you and I were destined to end up together.
I think that we fell in love and work hard at our relationship.
Some days we work really hard.
So you don't want to live with Don in a cheese house?
No, I've had second thoughts about that.
Do you realize how hard it'd be to clean?
 I love you.  I know.
You know what? I'm gonna take you out to dinner tonight.
I found this place that makes the greatest mozzarella sticks
and jalepino poppers.
No? Really? They taste so good.
And I know Chandler is kidding,
but it happens whenever he touches my stomach.
I mean I'm really worried the baby won't like him.
 Are you okay?  Yeah, sure.
Look, the reason...
Is it hot in here?
Not for me, but why don't you take off your sweater?
I would, but this is a nice place...
...and my Tshirt has a picture of Calvin doing Hobbes.
Oh, my God, really? Can I see it?
Yeah, sure.
I wouldn't think Hobbes would like that so much.
How long have we known each other?
Seven, eight...
Eight years. Wow.
 A long time.  Yeah.
But over the past few weeks, I...
Okay! Sorry about the wait, but it is megajammed in here.
We have a couple specials tonight...
 Actually could you give us a second?  Sure.
Second's up!
Not that kind of table.
So you were saying?
I'm not quite sure.
Okay. You asked how long we knew each other,
and I said eight years.
Then the waiter came over and cut his tip in half...
...and now here we are.
Yeah. Here we are.
I...
I think I'm falling in love with you.
What?
I'm falling in love with you.
Who are you talking to?
Oh, you're kidding. It's a joke.
Funny. It's funny!
I don't get it.
Okay.
Are you...?
How did...?
When?
Does it really matter?
It is hot in here.
Rach, I know this is a lot.
You don't have to say anything.
You take as much time as you need.
Okay, you gotta say something.
Joey, Joey, I love you so much.
 But...  But.
Joey?
Right. Hey, that's...
That's okay. That's fine.
It's pretty much what I was expecting.
So it's no big deal, all right?
I think I'm gonna go.
No, Joey. Please don't leave like this.
You can't do this to a pregnant woman!
Don't start doing that.
You can't do that, Rach, because you're gonna make me...
Oh, there we go!
 Can I?  Sure.
Oh, Joey. I don't want to lose...
You can't, okay? Ever.
 I'm so sorry.  No, no, no, Rach.
Please don't be sorry.
Okay? Don't be sorry.
You know, I was only kidding.
Yeah, that was a real good one.
 Is this your table?  Yeah.
 God, you'll be here all night.  I know.
I haven't even read them the specials yet.
What's the matter with them?
I don't know. I think maybe one of them is dying.
I kind of hope it's the girl.
The guy is really cute!
Joey? Are you in there?
 That's Rachel.  Joey, you have to talk to her.
No. I can't. I can't. Not after the other night.
It's too weird, okay?
Don't tell her I'm here.
Don't eat that!
 Hey, Rachel.  Is Joey here?
 I don't see him. Do you see him?  I don't see him.
Maybe he's in the sugar bowl. Joey? Nope.
Well, at least you make each other laugh.
 What's up?  I haven't seen him since that night
that he told me how he, you know...
I don't know, I think he's avoiding me.
Why is that bagel on the floor?
 We were playing a game. Was Chandler naked?
Sort of like a ringtoss kind of situation?
 Sure!  What? No! No!
All right, listen. If you see Joey,
will you just tell him that...?
Tell him I miss him.
Okay. Did you hear that?
Yeah. That naked bagel game?
Dude, I don't know. That's a pretty small hole.
 Honey, you've gotta talk to her.  I can't.
You guys don't know what it's like
to put yourself out there like that and just get shot down.
I don't know what that's like?
Until I was 25, I thought the response
to "I love you" was "Oh, crap."
No rejection?
I got shot down at fat camp.
Boy, kids are mean when they're hungry.
So, what do I do?
This Rachel. You're gonna never talk to her again?
I know it's weird and it's awkward, but you gotta at least try.
Yeah, okay.
I almost forgot this was on your...
We didn't play it!
Friends S08E17 The One With The Tea Leaves
Okay, so when you're done with your tea,
I'll look at the leaves and tell your fortune.
 You didn't know read tea leaves?  I've done it for years.
I actually stopped because I was so accurate.
And one of the great joys of life...
...is its wondrous unpredictability, you know?
And also, tea tends to give me the trots.
 Okay. I'm done. Read mine.  Okay.
I see a ladder.
Which can mean either a promotion or a violent death.
I'm the head chef. I can't get promoted.
Who's next?
 Okay. I'm done. Do mine.  Okay.
Oh! Okay, I see a circle.
Which can either mean you're having a baby...
...or you'll make a scientific discovery!
Well, I have been spending a lot of time in the lab.
What does yours say, Pheebs?
All right.
Oh, I'm gonna meet a guy! And really soon!
He's gonna be the man of my dreams.
Probably not the guy I had a dream about last night.
Has anyone seen my shirt?
It's a buttondown, like a faded salmon color?
You mean your pink shirt?
Faded salmon color?
No, I haven't seen your pink shirt.
Great. I must have left it at Mona's. I knew it!
I'm sure you can get another one at Ann Taylor's.
That's my favorite shirt. I love that shirt.
Just ask Mona to give it back.
I don't know. I guess could.
It's just we didn't really end things on such good terms.
And if I went over there,
I'd be ignoring the one thing she asked me to do when we broke up.
Jump up my own ass and die.
Oh, wait a second, you guys?
For the last couple weeks,
I've been seeing that guy everywhere I go.
We take the same bus, we go to the same bookstore,
and the same dry cleaners. Maybe he's the tea guy.
Phoebe, did you see that?
He totally checked you out! And he is so cute!
Mine is a picture of the Village People. What does that mean?
Tea gives Phoebe the trots!
I thought Joey and I would be okay once we hung out,
but it's like we don't even know how to be with each other any more.
I konw, it's tough now, but things will get better.
How do you know that?
What if it gets worse and worse and worse,
to the point where we can't be in the same room with each other?
I'm not great at the advice.
Can I interest you in a sarcastic comment?
Some cheese?
Honey, why is the Bruce Springsteen CD
in the Cat Stevens case?
Let's just say if I can't find the right CD case,
I just put it in the nearest one.
Okay. Where is the Cat Stevens CD?
In the James Taylor case.
 Where is James Taylor CD?  Honey, I'll save you some time.
Two hundred CDs, not one of them in the right case.
Okay. No need to panic. Deep breaths, everyone.
Okay, we're just gonna have to spend some time
and put the CDs in the right cases.
If we do that, we should come up with some kind of order.
You know, alphabetically or by genre?
I don't know. We have to talk this through.
Oh, my God, you guys have such problems!
I feel so terrible for you!
All right. Okay, I'm sorry.
Look, you and Joey, you're both focusing
on this uncomfortable thing.
What you need to do is to change the subject.
Next time you see him try to get him talking about something else.
Yeah, that makes sense.
Yeah. I don't know, maybe you have a work problem
that you need his advice on.
 I could do that.  Good.
Honey, the Miami Vice soundtrack? Really?
They were just giving those away at the store.
In exchange for money.
I really don't know what to tell you, Rach, I really don't.
Maybe Joey could help you out with your big work problem.
 What?  Yeah, Joey, she's...
Rachel's got this big work problem.
It is a headscratcher.
You know what? If we're gonna make dinner,
we're gonna have to leave.
So you have a big work problem?
Yeah. It's, uh...
Yeah, it's, uh...
You know, it's nothing.
Okay.
So I think I'm gonna take off.
No, wait, Joey, it is. It's something. It's...
It's my boss.
 Yeah?  Yeah. And, uh...
And my baby.
Yeah?
My boss wants to buy my baby.
What? Oh, my God!
I know, I told you, it's a really big problem!
 He wants to buy your baby?  Can you believe that?
 That's crazy.  That's what I told him!
 How did this even happen?  Well, I'll tell you.
See, my boss and his wife, they can't have children, so...
And then when we were at the Christmas party...
...he got drunk and said to me,
"Rachel, I want to buy your baby."
Man!
When you said it was a problem about your boss and the baby...
...I figured it was about maternity leave.
Yeah.
Yeah, that would have been a much simpler problem.
 Oh, hello.  Oh, it's you. I see you everywhere.
I'm Jim. Jim Nelson.
Hi, JimJim Nelson.
I'm PhoebePhoebe Buffay.
We certainly have been seeing a lot of each other lately.
We have. Maybe we'll be seeing each other
at dinner tomorrow night, say around 8 o'clock?
Well, maybe we will.
Mona?
Okay, if I were a salmon shirt, where would I be?
I am so sorry I spilled wine all over your shirt.
 It's okay.  No, it's still wet.
Let me get it out before it sets.
I have something you could wear.
Here.
I don't know if I want to wear a woman's shirt.
 No, no, that's a man's shirt.  Awfully pink.
It's not pink!
Oh, my god. Honey, we are so meant to be together.
Look, we both have the copies of Annie soundtrack.
Honey, both yours.
Hey, great advice on that Joey thing.
Yeah? The work problem?
It was perfect.
It really felt like he was my friend again.
What problem did you say you have?
Oh, that's not important.
The point is, I really... I think everything's gonna be okay.
May I help you?
You think you can just buy my friend's baby?
Isn't it funny how we kept running into each other?
It's as if someone really wants us to be together.
Someone does. Me.
Witty banter. Well done.
 Good.  So tell me a little bit about yourself.
Okay. I'm a masseuse.
And I used to work at this place...
Do you like to party?
I like parties.
You're wild, aren't you?
Yeah, I guess. A little.
Ain't no thing. I'm wild too.
So anyway...
...I've lived in New York, somewhat wildly, I guess...
...for, well, since I was 14.
I'm sorry. I'm staring.
It's just that you have the most beautiful eyes.
 Oh, stop it.  And your breasts!
Okay.
Look, you're coming on a little strong.
I'll give you the benefit of the doubt.
Because since the universe really wants us to be together.
So why don't we start over?
You can tell me about yourself.
 All right.  Okay.
I write erotic novels...
...for children.
 What?  They're wildly unpopular.
Oh, my God!
Also, you might be interested to know that I have a Ph.D.
Wow! You do?
Yep. A pretty huge...  All right.[Ph.D.=pretty huge dick]
The sun'll come out...tomorrow! Bet...
your bottom dollar that tomorrow...
There'll be sun.
Joey, honey, listen. Thank you for talking to my yesterday
about that thing with my boss. That really means a lot.
Not a problem. Just so you know...
...that guy won't be bothering you about that baby thing anymore.
 What?  Let's just say I took care of it.
Let's say more.
Don't worry. Don't worry. I just told him, very nicely:
"You don't go buying people's babies! So back off!"
 What?  What?
No, no, no!
Joey, he doesn't want to buy my baby! I made that up!
What? Why?
So we would have something to talk about!
So it wouldn't be awkward!
And you couldn't think of anything else?
You said your boss wants to buy your baby?
I can't believe you yelled at my boss!
I'll lose my job! What am I gonna do?
You could always sell your baby.
Joey, I can't believe you brought my boss into this!
I'll be fired!
 You lied to me!  Well, she told me to!
Chandler has two copies of Annie!
Oh, my God!
 Ross!  Hello!
Ross, what are you doing?
Not touching myself,
if that makes anyone less uncomfortable.
Morning. You wanted to see me?
Please, come in. Have a seat.
Look, Mr. Zelner...
 I think it's best that I speak first.  Yeah.
I've asked Lee from human resources to be here
as a witness to our conversation.
Oh, God.
If I in any way
implied that I wanted to buy your baby...
...I am sorry. Okay?
Last week, when I asked you when your due date was...
...I certainly did not mean that
I felt that I was "due" your baby.
I want to be very clear...
...that I understand that it's your baby...
...and it is not mine to purchase.
Well, as long as we are clear about that.
There it is.
 That's not your regular cleaners.  I know.
but that creep that I went on that date with goes to there,
so I have to find a new one.
I also have to find a new video store,
a new bank, a new adult bookstore, a new grocery store...
 What?  A new grocery store.
The universe said I'd meet a nice guy.
And that's what they gave me?
When I get up there, I'm gonna kick some ass.
Don't worry Phoebe, You'll meet someone.
If I can meet a great guy, so can you.
Yeah, we both can. And we both will.
 You didn't have to come in with me.  Are you kidding?
This is where they get out stains.
This is like Disneyland for me.
I'm gonna be over here watching the dance of the clean shirts.
Excuse me. I think you dropped...
 Wow!  What?
I'm sorry. It's just that you're so incredibly beautiful.
Well, I'm sorry about that too. But what are you gonna do?
I hope you don't think I'm crazy,
but I feel like I was meant to pick this up,
 Do you believe in that kind of thing?  A little.
Now you're talking.
Would you like to go out and have a cup of coffee?
I'd love to. Let me tell my friend.
An ink stain! Can I watch how you get this out?
She must have left.
 So? What happened?  It's all gonna be okay.
They're so happy I'm not suing them,
that they gave me one extra month paid maternity leave.
So long as I understand the money
should not be construed as a down payment
on this or any other child that I may bear.
Ralph Lauren is going out of their way
to show they're not in the babybuying business.
Chandler, can you give us a minute?
Oh I'm sorry, you're kicking me out of my own living room?
Yeah.
I'll be in there.
Joey, I'm really sorry I lied to you.
I was just trying to make things...
I know. I know.
It kind of worked.
I mean, you know, I don't know about you,
but I haven't thought about our thing since all this.
Yeah, you're right.
Yeah. It's kind of been like "us" again, a little bit.
 Yeah, I know. I've missed that.  Me too.
I haven't thought about how I put myself out there...
and said that stuff. How you didn't feel the same way about me
and how it was really awkward.
My gynecologist tried to kill me.
Item J437A.
Color: Winterberry.
Hi, listen. Come here. Come...
I'm so, so sorry about yesterday.
I'm really, really sorry. It's just...
Listen, Ross, you don't have to apologize.
I understand why you were there.
 You do?  Yeah. You still have feelings for me.
To be honest, I still have feelings for you, too.
I wish we could work it out, Ross, but we can't.
It's too complicated with you and Rachel and the baby.
I just...
It just wasn't meant to be.
Oh, God. You're right.
Ross, we have to be strong.
Okay, I'm gonna go.
Can I? To remember you?
No.
Ross, Mon.
Is it okay if I bring someone to your parents' anniversary party?
 Sure.  Yeah.
Who's the guy?
His name is Parker, and I met him at the cleaners.
Did he put a little starch in your bloomers?
Who said that?
No, he's really great, though.
He has this incredible zest for life.
He treats me like a queen.
Except at night when he treats me like the naughty girl I am.
By the way, would it be okay if I give the toast
to mom and dad this year?
Yeah, you sure you want to after what happened at their 20th?
Yeah. I'd really like to.
Okay, hopefully this time Mom won't boo you.
Yes! Every year Ross makes the toast,
and it's always really moving, and always makes them cry.
This year, I'm gonna make them cry.
You wonder why Ross is their favorite?
No, really. Any time Ross makes a toast,
everyone cries and hugs him and pats him on the back.
And they all come up to me and say, "God, your brother."
You know what they're gonna say this year?
"God, you."
Well, I can promise you, at least one person will be crying.
I'm an actor, and any actor worth his salt can cry on cue.
Really? You can do that?
Oh, you kidding me? Watch.
Well, I can't do it with you guys watching me!
Friends S08E18 The One In Massapequa
 What are you doing?  I'm working on my toast for the party.
Or as I like to call it: "Sobfest 2002."
 Hey, check this out.  It's a dog.
It's a dead dog.
That's ChiChi. She died when I was in high school.
It's your parents' anniversary
and you're going to talk about their dead pet?
It's good stuff, huh?
Joey? You got a present for my parents? That's so sweet.
Yeah. In honor of their 35th wedding anniversary,
I had a star named after them.
That is so cool.
And I got them a book on Kama Sutra for the Elderly.
Do you guys have any extra ribbon?
Yeah. Sure. What do you need?
We got lace, satin, sateen,
raffia, gingham, felt...
And I think my testicles may be in here too.
ChiChi! Oh, I loved this dog.
Monica couldn't get braces because ChiChi needed knee surgery.
What?
You're the 200pounder 11yearold who rode her!
Hey! Everybody, this is Parker. Parker, this is...
No, don't tell me.
Let me guess: Joey, Monica, Ross, Rachel...
...and I'm sorry, Phoebe didn't mention you.
Chandler, I'm kidding! Already you're my favorite.
Why don't all of you tell me a little about your self?
Actually, I'm sorry. We probably should get going.
Classic Ross!
Rachel, look how you glow! May I ?
I think you already are.
Rachel, you have life growing inside you.
Is there anything in this world more miraculous...
A picture of a dog! Whose is this?
That's my old dog. He passed away years ago.
Well, at least you were lucky to have him.
Bowwow, old friend. Bowwow.
So where's the party?
It's out on the island. It's in Massapequa.
Massapequa, it sounds like a magical place.
Tell me about Massapequa,
is it steeped in Native American history?
Well, there is an Arby's in the shape of a tepee.
I've got my note cards.
 You got the presents?  Yeah.
 And I've got the car keys.  We're driving?
 Yeah.  Aces.
 So he seems like a nice guy.  Yeah, I like him a lot.
You want to hang back and take our own cab?
Okay, otherwise I'm not going.
 Hey, Mom.  This is such a great party!
Thirtyfive years. Very impressive.
Do you have any pearls of wisdom?
 Jack?  Why would you serve food on such a sharp stick?
It's a good question, Dad. It's a good question.
 Congratulations, you two.  Thank you, we're so excited.
And also, congratulations on your wedding.
 Can we talk to you for just a moment?  Yeah.
It's just a little thing.
While we think it's simply marvelous
that you're having this baby out of wedlock...
some of our friends are less openminded.
 Which is why we told them you're married.  What?
Thanks for going along with this.
Dad, we have to pretend that we're married?
Son, I had to shave my ears for tonight.
You can do this.
 Can you believe that?  I know.
If you do the ears, you may as well take a pass at the nosal area.
No, no. I don't want to have to lie about us being married.
No, I know. I don't either.
But you know what ? It's their party, and it's one night.
We don't have to lie. We just won't say anything.
If it comes up again, we'll just smile, we'll nod along...
 Ross?  Rachel?
Hi, Aunt Lisa. Uncle Dan.
Congratulations on the baby and on the wedding.
Here's a little something to get you started.
So how's married life treating you?
 Unbelievable. It's great!  We love marriage.
We'll see you later.
What a beautiful place. What a great night.
I have to tell you,
being here with all of you in Event Room C...
...I feel so lucky. Think of the good times that happened here.
The birthdays, the proms, the mitzvahs, both bar and bat!
But none of them will compare with tonight!
My God, I don't want to forget this moment!
It's like I want to take a mental picture of you all.
Click.
I don't think the flash went off.
I'm gonna find the men's room. I'll be right back.
 I'll go with you.  Come on, come on.
Somewhere there is someone with a tranquilizer gun...
...and a huge butterfly net looking for that man.
I have to go to the bathroom too,
but I don't want him complimenting my thing.
So glad we weren't in the car. Did he ever let up?
He called the Long Island Expressway a "concrete miracle."
This room. This night.
That waiter! His shoes!
I must take a mental picture!
Sorry.
Were you guys making fun of Parker?
That depends, how much did you hear?
He's a little enthusiastic. What's wrong with that?
 It's so much.  Well, so what? I like him.
Do I make fun of the people you've dated?
Tag, Janice, Mona.
No, because friends don't do that.
But do you want my opinion?
Do you want it? 'Cause in my opinion,
your collective dating record
reads like a who's who of human crap!
 I feel terrible.  I know.
What was wrong with Mona?
 Open it, open it, open it.  Yeah, baby!
So we never got to hear about your wedding.
We were surprised we weren't invited.
No, no, it was just our parents and 1 or 2 friends.
It was a small wedding.
But it was beautiful.
It was small, but kind of spectacular.
Where did you have it?
On a cliff in Barbados, at sunset.
And Stevie Wonder sang "Isn't She Lovely" as I walked down the aisle.
 Really?  Yeah. Stevie's a family friend.
Oh, my God. That sounds amazing.
 I'd love to see pictures.  Yeah, so would I.
You wouldn't think Annie Liebowitz
would forget to put film in the camera.
Would you excuse us for a second?
What are you doing?
What? I'm not you.
This may be my only wedding I ever have.
 And I want it to be amazing.  Okay.
Maybe I rode in on a Harley.
Okay. Ross, it has to be realistic.
Say, are you okay? You seem kind of quiet.
No, I'm fine. I'm great. I'm with you.
And I'm with you. What a great time to be alive!
Look at this plate bouncy thing.
What an inspired solution to man's platedispensing problems.
 Oysters! Let me feed you one.  That's not necessary.
 Please?  Actually I don't eat...
 I won't quit until you try one.  Okay, fine, fine.
Good.
What're they like? I've never had one.
 Why don't you just try one.  No, they look too weird.
What are you doing?
Just going over my toast.
Those two will never know what hit them.
I can't wait. They'll cry so hard,
they'll be fighting for breath.
If you want to, I could just hold them down and you could just...
And my veil was lace, made by blind Belgian nuns.
Blind?
Not at first, but it's very intricate work.
They said even though they lost their sight, it's all worth it.
 I bet you looked beautiful.  Well, I don't know about that.
But there were some people that said
I looked like a floating angel.
How did you propose?
Oh, yeah, that's a great story.
Well, actually, I took her to the planetarium.
That's where we had our first date.
She walked in
and I had the room filled with lilies, her favorite flower.
 That is so sweet!  I want to hear the rest!
Then Fred Astaire singing, "The Way You Look Tonight"
came on the sound system, and the lights came down,
I got on one knee...
and written across the dome, in the stars, were the words:
"Will you marry me?"
And the ring was the size of my fist.
Hey, Phoebe? Look...
...I want to apologize about before. Okay? We were being jerks.
Parker's a nice guy, and I'd like to get to know him.
Then you better do it now.
 Why?  Because I'm gonna kill him.
 What? What?  You guys were right.
He's too excited about everything.
I'm all for living life,
but this is the Gellers' 35th anniversary.
Let's call a spade a spade. This party stinks.
I know. I'm having the worst time.
There was a 15minute line for the buffet,
and when I got to the plates...
...I slipped on a giant booger.
Are you sure it wasn't an oyster?
It could've been. I didn't look at it.
I just wiped it on Chandler's coat and got the hell out.
I thought he was a great guy. I was so excited about him.
Well, hey, you should be excited about him.
There's nothing wrong with him. He's a good guy.
 You think?  Yeah, you know what I think?
 I think we were all just being too negative.  You're right.
You're right. He's just embracing life.
We could all stand to be a little more like Parker.
You know what? I'm like him!
I'm a sunny, positive person!
Actually, you have a little bit of an edge.
What's that now?
 Oh, it's Parker!  Look, the Bunny Hop!
 Oh, I love it!  You do?
Are you kidding?
People acting like animals to music? Come on!
Okay, it's time for the toast.
I know that normally Ross gives the toast,
but this year I'm gonna do it.
No, it's gonna be great. Really.
Okay.
Mom, Dad, when I got married...
...one of the things that made me sure that I could do it
was the amazing example the two of you set for me.
For that, and for so many other things, I want to thank you.
I know I probably don't say it enough, but...
I love you.
When I look around this room,
I'm saddened by the thought of those who could not be with us.
Nana, my beloved grandmother,
who would so want to be here.
But she can't...
...because she's dead.
As is our dog, ChiChi.
I mean, look how cute she is... was.
Do me a favor, pass this to my parents.
Remember she's dead, okay? Her and Nana, gone.
Does anybody remember when...
...Debra Winger had to say goodbye
to her children in Terms of Endearment?
Didn't see that?
No movie fans?!
You want to hear something sad?
The other day, I was watching 60 Minutes
and there was this piece on orphans in Romania...
...who have been so neglected that they were incapable of love.
You people are made of stone!
Here's to Mom and Dad. Whatever!
Thank you, Monica. That was interesting.
Wasn't it interesting, Jack?
Why don't I remember this dog?
Ross? Why don't you give us your toast now?
Oh, no, Mom. It's just Monica this year.
You're not saying anything?
On our 35th wedding anniversary?
No, of course.
Everybody?
I just wanted to say...
...on behalf of my new bride, Rachel...
...and myself, that if...
...if in 35 years,
we're half as happy as you guys are...
...we'll count ourselves the luckiest people in the world.
Oh, Ross.
I just wish Nana were alive to hear Ross' toast.
My God, what a fantastically welllit hallway.
Can I get you something to drink, like a water and Valium?
I must say, this apartment, it's...
there are no words.
 Thank God.  It's a haven.
A thirdfloor paradise, a modern Eden in the midst.
Yeah, I know, I know. Gotcha.
Listen, why don't we just sit and relax,
just be with each other quietly.
That sounds great.
My god. This is the most comfortable couch
I've ever sat on in my entire life.
Let's try something else. Let's play a game.
 I love games.  Shocking.
Let's play the game of...
...who can stay quiet the longest.
Or Jenga.
Let's play this one first, and remember,
whoever talks first loses.
 I lose, now Jenga.  Oh, my God.
Is something wrong?
Wrong? You know the word "wrong"?
Everything isn't perfect? Everything isn't magical?
Everything isn't aglow with the light of a million fairies?
They were just brake lights, Parker!
Excuse me for putting a good spin on a traffic jam.
You don't have to put a good spin on everything!
I'm sorry. That's who I am. I'm a positive person.
No, I'm a positive person.
You are like Santa Claus on Prozac.
At Disneyland, getting laid!
So what do you want me to do? You want me to be more negative?
You want me to be less happy?
Much less happy.
Fine. Well, then to quote Ross, "I better be going."
So long!
Don't let the "best door in the world"
hit you in the ass on your way out.
Isn't this the most incredible fight you've had in your entire life?
And then we could've gone from the ceremony
to the reception with you in the sidecar.
Ross, it just wouldn't be feasible.
But a dove placing the ring on your finger
would've been no problem.
It was fun being married to you tonight.
Yeah, and it was the easiest 400 bucks I've ever made.
 Okay, Ross, can I ask you something?  Yeah.
That proposal at the planetarium?
I know, I know. It was stupid.
Are you kidding?
With the lilies, and the song and the stars?
It was really wonderful.
Did you just make that up?
I thought of it when we were going out.
That's how I imagined I would ask you to marry me.
Well, that would've been very hard to say no to.
It's a good thing I didn't do it,
because it sounds like it would have been a very expensive wedding.
 Okay, good night.  Good night.
Even if the sidecar had a windscreen
so your hair wouldn't get messed up?
 I will think about it.  That's all I'm asking.
Okay, that's it. I give up.
At Mom and Dad's 40th anniversary,
you're the one giving the speech.
You know, I don't understand why they didn't cry.
It was a beautiful speech.
 Come on.  All that stuff you said about true love?
You were right. We did learn a lot from Mom and Dad.
That picture of ChiChi with her mischievous grin.
And what you said about Nana?
Yeah, she really would've wanted to be there.
And you know what?
I think she was.
Oh, good God, Ross, how the hell do you do it?
So I'm in my apartment
doing the Soap Opera Digest crossword puzzle...
...and guess who is the clue for three down?
Three down, "Days of Our Lives star, blank Tribbiani."
That's me! I'm blank!
How cool is this! We know three down.
I'm touching three down.
Yeah, you are, baby.
Three down knows I'm married.
What's three down doing?
So do they call to tell you your name's gonna be in this?
No. They really like me over there.
They wanted to do a big profile on me, but I said no.
Why'd you say no?
Remember what happened the last time I did an interview for them?
I said I write a lot of my own lines, the writers got mad...
and made my character fall down the elevator shaft.
So who knows what I might say this time.
If only there was something in your head
to control the things you say.
Come on, Joey, you'll totally keep it in check this time.
And plus, you know the publicity
would be really good for your career.
You deserve that.
And if you do the interview, you could mention,
I don't know, "gal pal Rachel Green."
Is that "gal pal" spelled LOSER?
Okay, don't listen to him. Please?
Fine, all right, I'll do it.
But you guys have to be at the next table
so you can stop me if I start to say something stupid.
Just then, or all the time?
Because we have jobs, you know?
We'll be there for you the whole time. Just remember:
Gal pal, Rachel Green.
I'm gonna be in Soap Opera Digest!
And not just in the dumb crossword puzzle.
Seriously, proud of you.
Friends S08E19 The One With Joey’s Interview
I really appreciate you taking the time to do this.
Not at all. Happy to do it.
You think we're being obvious?
No. We're just four people with neck problems,
who talk like this.
I think it's great you wanted to meet here.
When most people hear the magazine's paying for it,
they want a big, fancy restaurant.
Actually, I didn't know the magazine was paying.
Wouldn't have mattered.
I do this for the fans, not the free food.
 Can I get you anything?  I'll have a cup of coffee.
And I'll have all the muffins.
We're not talking.
Oh, finally.
So according to your bio,
you've done quite a bit of work before Days of Our Lives.
Anything that you're particularly proud of?
All you want is a dingle
What you envy's a shwang
A thing through which you can tinkle
Or play with, or simply let hang
Folks, has this ever happened to you?
You go to the refrigerator to get a nice glass of milk,
and these darn cartons are so flingin'flangin' hard to open.
Boy, you said it, Mike.
 There's gotta be a better way!  And there is, Kevin!
This is the first time he's ever used this product,
you're gonna see how easy this is to do. Go ahead.
 This works in any milk can'ton.  It is easy.
Now I can have milk every day.
So this is it, Victor?
Yeah, I guess it is. And so...
...I'm gonna get on this spaceship...
...and I'm gonna go to Blargon 7 in search of alternative fuels.
But when I return 200 years from now,
you'll be long gone.
But I won't have aged at all.
So you tell your greatgreat granddaughter to look me up.
Because, Adrian...
...baby...
...I'm gonna want to meet her.
Okay, here I come. Here I come. See I'm coming to fix the copier.
I can't get to the copier.
I'm thinking, "What do I do? What do I do?"
So I just watch them have sex.
And then I say... Wait, here's my line:
You know, that's bad for the paper tray.
 Nice work, my friend.  Thank you.
Wait, you see me again.
Hang on, the guy's butt's blocking me.
There I am. There I am. There I am.
There are so many things, it's hard to pick just one.
I'm gonna get some coffee, anyone want anything?
Yeah. I'd actually love s blueberry muffin and chamomile tea.
Double latte. Extra foam.
 A bagel with only...  I was just being polite.
Okay. How about when you're not working?
What do you do in your spare time?
Look at this clown.
Just because he's got a bigger boat
he thinks he can take up the whole river.
Get out of the way, jackass!
Who names their boat Coast Guard, anyway?
That is the Coast Guard.
What are they doing out here?
The coast is all the way over there!
Check it out. This is unbelievable.
Joey has been holding his breath for almost four minutes.
Dude, are you trying to kill me?
Well, I see you've had a very productive day.
Isn't the cowboy hat a little much?
Come on, it's fun!
All right.
Isn't this a woman's hat?
Dude, stop talking crazy and make us some tea.
You know what? We have to turn off the porn.
I think you're right.
 All right, ready?  One.
 Two, three.  Three.
That's kind of nice.
 It's kind of a relief.  Yeah.
 You wanna see if we still have it?  Yeah.
Free porn! We have free porn here!
In my spare time, I read to the blind.
And I'm also a mento for kids.
 A mento?  You know, a mento. A role model.
 A mento?  Right.
Like the candy?
As a matter of fact, I do.
Another thing that our readers always want to know
is how soap stars stay in such great shape.
Do you have a fitness regime?
We stars usually just try to eat right and get lots of exercise.
You realize that we've been throwing this ball,
without dropping it for an hour?
Are you serious?
Yeah. I realized it about a halfhour ago
but I didn't want to say anything,
'cause I didn't want to jinx it.
 Wow, we are pretty good at this.  Yeah.
Hey, we totally forgot about lunch.
I think that's the first time I've ever missed a meal.
My pants are a little loose.
What's wrong with you?
I got this blinding pain in my stomach
when I was lifting weights before.
And then I passed out.
I haven't been able to stand up since.
But I don't think it's anything serious.
Sounds like a hernia. Go to the doctor.
No way! If I go to the doctor for anything,
it's gonna be for this thing sticking out of my stomach!
Why'd I have to start working out again?
Damn you, fifteens!
 What is it?  A trifle. It's got all of these layers.
First there's a layer of ladyfingers, then a layer of jam,
then custard, which I made from scratch.
Raspberries, more ladyfingers, beef sauteed with peas and onions.
Then a little bit more custard.
It tastes like feet.
I like it.
Are you kidding?
What's not to like? Custard, good.
Jam, good. Meat, good!
Well, you don't look good, Joe.
Well, the fridge broke, so I had to eat everything.
Cold cuts, ice cream, limes.
Hey, what was in that brown jar?
 That's still in there?  Not anymore.
This piece doesn't have floor on it.
 Stick to your side.  Hey, come on, now.
All right, what are we having?
I don't believe in these crazy diets.
Just everything in moderation.
Your muffins.
I'll take those to go.
For the kids.
I know what I wanted to ask you.
You were on the show years ago and then they killed you off.
What happened there?
It was so stupid,
I said some stuff in an interview I shouldn't have said.
 But believe me, that's not gonna happen today.  Understood.
 So, what'd you say back then?  I said that I...
 Hey, Joey!  How you doing?
You guys, this is Shelly.
She's interviewing me for Soap Opera Digest.
Shelly, these are my friends.
Hi, I'm gal pal Rachel Green.
And if you want the dirt, I'm the one you come too.
This might be Joey's baby, who knows?
I'm just kidding. Seriously, gal pal Rachel Green.
Who just lost the respect of her unborn child.
I'm gonna go get this warmed up.
Joey, you're doing great.
So far, nothing stupid.
 Mento?  No, thanks.
So as Joey's friends,
is there anything that you guys think our readers should know?
No, just that he is a great guy.
That'll get you into Soap Opera Digest.
Well, I...
I'd just like to say that Joey...
...truly has enriched the days of our lives.
I think that you don't expect someone so hot to be so sweet.
 I like that. What's your name?  Phoebe Buffay.
How do you spell that? So we can get it right.
Okay, it's P as in Phoebe. H as in Heebie.
O as in Obie. E as in Ebie. B as in Beebee.
And E as in, "'ello there, mate!"
Great. It was nice meeting all of you.
 Yeah, you too.  Thanks.
So it seems you have a lot of friends.
Who would you say is your best friend?
How come you have two?
Well, this one's for you.
 Get out!  No, I can't.
No, no. Listen, I, I know how much this means to you
and I also know that this is about more than just jewelry,
It's about you and me
and the fact that we're best buds.
Is this friendship? I think so!
Check it out! We're bracelet buddies!
That's what they'll call us!
 Joey, I'm sorry.  It's all right. Don't worry about it.
No, but look, that's gonna leave a stain.
Rach, hey, it's fine. You're at Joey's.
 Really?  Yeah, look.
 I've never lived like this before.  I know!
Well, don't waste it. I mean, it's still food. Jeez!
I've been feeling incredibly guilty about this,
because I wanna be a good friend and damn it, I am a good friend.
So just shut up and close your eyes.
You are a good friend.
The audition was this morning, and I didn't get it.
But that was a hell of a kiss. Rachel is a very lucky girl.
Let's get the contestants out of their isolation booths.
And they're off!
Get your foot off my contestant! Judge!
Judge rules: No violation.
The duck gets the Nutter Butter!
No! That's not a NutterButter, that's just an old Wonton!
Judge rules: Nutter Butter!
Tough call.
I'd seen this thing on The Discovery Channel.
Wait a minute. I saw that!
On The Discovery Channel.
Yeah, about jellyfish, and how if you...
You peed on yourself?
You can't say that! You don't know!
I thought I'd pass out from the pain.
Anyway, I tried, but I couldn't bend that way.
So...
That's right, I stepped up!
She's my friend and she needed help!
If I had to, I'd pee on any one of you!
Nope. No best friend.
Just a lot of close friends.
So now back to the show.
How does it feel to have a huge gay fan base?
Really? Me?
Wow, I don't even know any huge gay people.
It hurts me. It physically hurts me.
Now, off the record, you're not...
What? Are you referring to my man's bag?
At first, I thought it just looked good, but it's practical, too.
Check it out. It's got compartments for stuff:
Your wallet, your keys, your address book.
Your makeup.
No, no, no. Should I climb down your front so we're face to face
or should I climb down your back
so we're butt to face?
 I think face to face. Face to face, yeah.  I would say that.
 Okay, here I come.  All right.
Oh, my... How much do you weigh, Ross?
I prefer not to answer that right now.
I'm still carrying a little holiday weight.
You know when we talked about "face to face,"
we didn't think it all the way through!
Hey, Pheebs.
Check it out.
How much of a man am I?
Nice. Manly and also kind of a slut.
You're turning into a woman.
No, I'm not! Why would you say that? That's just mean!
Now I've upset you? What did I say?
Not what you said, it's just the way you said it.
Oh, my God! I'm a woman!
 Great nap.  It really was.
Me? Gay? No. No. No.
But I have a number of close friends who are.
So let's talk about women.
I'm sure our female readers will be interested
to know about your romantic life.
What I do is, I look a woman up and down and I say:
"Hey. How you doing?"
Oh, please.
Hey. How you doing?
Hey. How you doing?
He has an amazing Porsche under there.
I'd love to show you, but...
I just tucked her in. She's sleeping.
Would you two girls like to go for a drink?
 Is Rachel here? I'm her sister.  Oh, my God! Jill!
 Oh, my God! Rachel!  Oh, hi!
 Oh, my God! Introduce us!  Well, this is Chandler.
You know Monica and Ross.
That's Phoebe. That's Joey.
 Hey, how you doing?  Don't!
You're a really nice guy.
I'm happy to be your roommate and your friend.
I'm just... You know, I just don't feel that way about you.
I see what happened.
It's because I was trying to repel you. Right?
Believe me, you'd feel a lot different
if I turned it on.
 I don't think so.  Oh, I do.
How you doing?
I'm okay.
What? Oh, dear God!
Not much to tell there. I'm really shy.
So that's it. I guess that's all I need.
Thank you so much.
I think they will be running this in the beginning of next month.
Oh, great. Great. Thank you.
 Bye.  Byebye.
 I did it.  Amazing.
Wait, I almost forgot.
We have to ask everybody this:
Other than Days, what's your favorite soap opera?
Oh, I don't watch soap operas. Excuse me?
I have a life, you know?
Thank you. The readers at Soap Opera Digest
will be happy to learn that.
Good enough.
So close.
I can't believe they didn't put in the part
where you said you didn't watching soaps.
Yeah, I called the lady about that. I told her I was just joking.
She was nice about it.
 You slept with her, didn't you?  A little bit.
This picture of you is steamy.
That's just a little something for my huge gay fan base.
Did you just wink at me?
You're the one who loves the picture.
So, what's the final head count on my baby shower?
About twenty. Couple people from work had something else to do.
Also both of your sisters called and neither can make it.
What? You mean they're not coming to a social event
where there's no men and no booze?
That's shocking.
I don't care, as long as my mom's here.
Oh, my God. Your mother.
What? My mom's not gonna be here?
Well, given that we forgot to invite her,
it would be a big coincidence if she was.
My God!
It wasn't my fault, Phoebe was in charge of the invitations.
I don't have a mother. So often I forget...
Oh, give it a rest.
So my mother is not coming to my baby shower?
No.
Neither is mine.
You know what? Don't worry.
We'll take care of it. We'll call her.
You go home and get ready.
Please, make sure she comes. It's really important to me. It's my mom.
 I know. What's her number?  I don't know.
Go. I have it in my book. Go.
Wait a minute. If you're in charge of invitations,
why am I the one who has to call her?
Hello, Mrs. Green! Hi, it's Monica Geller.
 Oh, hello, Monica.  Hi.
I know this is lastminute,
but we've decided to throw an impromptu...
...baby shower for Rachel today.
I know, my daughter's told me about it
when they received their impromptu invitations a month ago.
Okay, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
For what, dear?
For not inviting me, or for lying about it?
Oh, my God! My ass is sweating.
Please, please, can you come? It starts at 4:00.
 Well, all right. I'll see you at 4.  Thank you.
 Isn't it at 3?  Son of a bitch!
Friends S08E20 The One With The Baby Shower
Hey, Joe! Wanna shoot some hoops?
I can't go. I'm practicing.
I got an audition to be the host of a new game show.
 Cool!  Great!
If I get it,
by day I'll be Dr. Drake Ramoray.
But by night I'll be Joey Tribbiani!
You'll be perfect for this!
That's already your name!
The auditiors in a couple hours, and I don't understand the game.
Do you want some help?
Oh, really? That'd be great.
Hey, you guys can be the contestants!
Awesome.
Okay, I guess we can lose to juniorhigh girls some other time.
All right. Let's play Bamboozled!
 Bamboozled?  Yeah. Isn't that a cool name?
 Yeah!  No!
All right. Okay. Our first contestant is Ross Geller.
Why don't you tell us a little something about you Ross?
Well, I'm a paleontologist. I live in New York.
I have a son, Ben. Hi, Ben! And...
I said, a little bit, Ross.
Now, how about you, Chandler?
Joey, I'm a headhunter.
I hook up outofwork Soviet scientists...
...with rogue Third World nations. Hi, Rasputin.
Excellent! Let's play Bamboozled! Chandler, you'll go first.
 What is the capital of Colombia?  Bogota.
It's Bogota, but close enough.
You can either pass your turn to Ross
or pick a Wicked Wango Card.
 What does a Wicked Wango Card do?  I should know that.
Let's see. One moment, please...
Here we are. A Wicked Wango Card
determines if you go higher or lower.
Higher or lower than what?
This is embarrassing!
Can you believe how lame this is?
I'm sorry. I don't believe contestants
are allowed to talk to each other.
I told the stripper to be here at 5. That's good, right?
You ordered a stripper for the shower?
That is totally inappropriate.
Why? He's gonna be dressed as a baby.
Oh, hi, Mrs. Green. I'm so glad you could make it.
Yeah, thank you so much. And again we're so sorry.
We could not feel worse about it.
Try.
There's my little girl!
 She's still mad.  Yeah, I know.
Isn't it great? One less person to make small talk with.
Phoebe, Sandra's mad at you too.
It doesn't bother you?
We've apologized twice. I can't do any more than that.
I know you hate it when people are mad at you...
...but you just have to be okay with it.
Okay. I can do that.
I gotta go powder my ass.
Look at that face! Just like when you were in high school.
If I didn't know better, i'd say you were a cheerleader in trouble.
 Come, let's get some tea.  Okay.
Oh, my! Look at that. Only three weeks to go.
Did you pick a nanny yet?
Now I don't want you to use your housekeeper
'cause it would just split her focus.
Actually, I'm not gonna use a nanny.
And I don't have a housekeeper.
It's like you're a cave person.
Rachel, you must get a nanny.
You don't know how overwhelming this is gonna be.
I mean when you were a baby I had full time help, I had Mrs. Kay.
Mrs. K! Oh, yeah, she was sweet.
She taught me Spanish.
I actually think I remember some of it.
Tu madre esta loca.
Such a sweet woman.
As great as she was, I can't afford that.
Rachel, I just had the greatest idea!
I'm gonna come and live with you!
What? What?
Oh, I'm so happy I'm gonna do this for my little girl.
Look at you. You have tears in your eyes.
Yes, yes, I do.
Ross, you're in the lead.
Would you like to take another question
or spin the Wheel of Mayhem?
The Wheel has not been my friend tonight, Joey.
I'll take another question.
Okay. This is gonna be tough. Hold your breath.
It's okay. I'm ready.
No dude, you gotta hold your breath
until you're ready to answer the question.
This is part of the game.
This is ridiculous! He's not gonna hold his...
Okay. What do you have a fear of
if you suffer from this phobia? Triska...
Holy cow. That's a big word. Trisk...
Seriously, look at this. Chandler, how do you say that?
 Let me see that.  This one right here.
 Triskaidekaphobia.  Fear of Triscuits!
 No! No. Fear of the number 13.  Fear of Triscuits?
It's possible. They have really sharp edges.
Alright, Chandler, you're up.
Wait a minute. I'm entitled to use my Angel Pass for a free turn.
This game makes no sense!
You're upset because you're losing.
Oh, come on, Ross. I think we're all losers here.
Alright, Chandler.
You can either spin the Wheel or pick a Google Card.
Let me think, let me think.
Oh, I don't care.
You must choose, Mr. Bing.
Either. It makes no difference.
Choose, you jackass.
 I'll take a card.  Okay, you picked the Gimme Card!
 You get all of Ross' points!  What?
This game is kind of fun!
You don't think it's a little crazy that you get all my points...
I don't think the contestants aren't supposed to speak to each other.
 Why did you invite my mother?  What?
She wants to move in with me and Ross
to help take care of the baby.
 For how long?  Eight weeks.
I love my mother,
but, my God, a long lunch with her is taxing.
I personally would be honored if she wanted to live with me.
She can't hear you.
What am I gonna do?
If you don't want your mother to move in with you, just tell her.
You're right. You're right. I'm about to have a baby.
I can tell my mother that I don't want her
to just be sleeping on my couch!
She'll wanna sleep in my bed with me. This can't happen.
That's right. That is right.
You go over there and tell her
you don't want her to live with you.
 Do not take no for an answer.  Okay.
This is great! Now she's gonna be mad at Rachel!
And I'm just gonna swoop in there
and be like the daughter she never had.
I have new respect for Chandler.
All right, everybody! It's time to open the presents!
Yes! I think the first gift that Rachel opens...
...should be from the grandmother of the baby.
Because you're the most important person in this room!
And in the world!
I don't have a gift
because I wasn't invited until the last minute.
But thank you so much, dear,
for bringing that to everybody's attention.
How about you less important people?
Let's open your presents!
It's okay that you didn't get me a gift.
I kind of did.
Me! Eight weeks of me.
Okay. See, Mom, the truth is, I can do this on my own.
Sweet heart, I know you're gonna be a terrific mom.
I just think you need a little help, especially at the beginning.
But mom, I really know what I'm doing. I can handle this.
Really? Remember Twinkles?
He was a hamster. I'm not gonna vacuum up my baby!
Okay, come on, Rach. It's present time!
You're the glue holding this party together.
It's kind of falling apart here.
 Oh, look!  Wow!
This is from your friends at work.
Oh, my gosh! Oh, wow!
Oh, I know what this is.
Wait a minute.
That can't be right.
Is that a beer bong for a baby?
Darling, that's a breast pump.
Did I say I was done guessing?
Okay, thank you for that.
Oh, wow! What's this?
 It's a Diaper Genie.  It dispenses clean diapers!
No. It's where you put dirty ones.
That's gross. Why don't you take it outside
and throw it in a dumpster?
You're gonna do that 10 times a day?
What, it goes 10 times a day?
Are we feeding this baby Indian food?
No, dear. That's what babies do.
Rachel, listen to your mother. She is very smart.
Plus, what are you planning on doing with the baby
while you're trotting out to the garbage ten times a day?
I don't know, I'd leave it on the changing table?
What? What did I do? What did I do?
You can't leave a baby alone.
Of course, I know that!
Of course you never leave a baby alone.
It would... She wouldn't be safe.
Not as safe as she would be with me, the baby dummy.
You know what?
Opening the presents is a little overwhelming right now.
So I think I'm gonna maybe open them all a little bit later.
But thank you for coming, and for these beautiful gifts...
...and this basket is beautiful.
It's actually a bassinet.
Okay, Mommy, don't ever leave me.
In what John Houston film would you hear this line,
"Badges? We don't need no stinking badges!"
Treasure of the Sierra Madre!
Correct! There's a possible backwards bonus!
 Madre Sierra the of Treasure!  Yes!
I'd like to go up the Ladder of Chance to the Golden Mud Hut, please!
 Wise choice. How many rungs?  Six!
 That noise can only mean one thing.  Hungry Monkey!
 I'd like a Wicked Wango Card.  Okay.
It's an audio question.
Name this television theme song:
Oh, my God. I know this. Give me a second.
 Tell it to the Time Turtle!  Shut up!
 "I Dream of Jeannie"!  Yes! Back in the lead!
I'd like to spin the Wheel.
Oh, come on!
Super Speedy Speed Round.
 Is there a Hopping Bonus?  Of course.
 Who invented bifocals?  Ben Franklin!
Correct. Which monarch ruled Great Britain the longest?
 Queen Victoria!  Correct again.
But you forgot to switch legs between questions.
So, no Hopping Bonus!
Every time!
 Yeah. Now over to Chandler.  I'd like a Google Card.
 Are you sure?  Yes! No! Google!
Oh, my God! Congratulations, Ross! Because, Chandler...
 you've been Bamboozled!  No!
 Yes!  This is the best game ever!
So you'll stay as long as I need you?
Of course, I am.
Mom, I swear I'm not an idiot.
I read all kind of books on pregnancy and giving birth.
But I just didn't think to read the part
about what to do when the baby comes.
Andand then guess what? The baby's coming...
...and I don't know what to do.
Oh, can I throw up in my Diaper Genie?
Sweetie, you're gonna be fine.
 Where you going?  I'm going to the bathroom.
Now, don't worry. Everything's gonna be okay.
It is gonna be okay!
Worth a shot.
Hey! Why are you all red and sweaty?
I just Bamboozled Chandler!
Which is not a sexual thing.
Well, that was a quick shower.
Not if you were here.
Looks like we got a lot of good stuff.
We did, but my mom got us the greatest gift of all.
A PlayDoh Barbershop?
No. She's going to live with us for eight weeks.
What?
Yes! She's gonna help us take care of the baby!
You're not serious!
She's a very nice woman,
but there's no way we can take eight weeks of her.
 She'll drive us totally crazy...  Hi, Ross!
Hey, roomie!
Hey, Joey, I'm Ray. I'm the producer of the show.
It's a pleasure to meet you, Ray.
This is Duncan and Erin. They're gonna help with the audition.
So uh, let's get the camera rolling.
 Right, Ray.  Whenever you're ready.
Hello. I'm Joey Tribbiani.
Let's play Bamboozled!
Erin, you get the first question.
In hockey, who is known as "The Great One"?
 Gretzky.  Correct!
Now, would you like to pick a Wicked Wango Card
or spin the Wheel of Mayhem?
Joey, didn't your agents give you the revised rules?
We've eliminated all that. No wheel. No cards.
Why?
The game was too complicated
and research showed people didn't follow it.
Well what's complicated?
You spin the Wheel of Mayhem to go up the Ladder of Chance...
You go past the Mud Hut through the Rainbow Ring
to the Golden Monkey.
You yank his tail, and you're in Paradise Pond!
Yeah. All that's gone.
It's basically just a simple questionandanswer game now.
Well, what's fun about that?
You expect me to host a boring game
that's just people standing around answering questions?
Well, there'll be women in bikinis holding up the scores.
Let's play Bamboozled!
Oh, and all those dinosaur knickknacks you have, Ross,
I thought they might be more at home in the garage.
Well, we don't have a garage.
Did I say garage? I meant garbage.
You know what, Mrs. Green?
Maybe it's not absolutely vital that you live with us.
Well, Rachel needs help with the baby.
I do. I really do. I don't know anything.
I'm sure that's not true.
Oh, no? Pheebs, Monica, do I know anything about babies?
 No. Not a thing.  It's frightening.
Even if she doesn't know anything, I do.
I have a son. His mother and I didn't live together.
When he was with me, I took care of him all the time, by myself.
 That's true. You do have another child.  Yeah.
With another woman.
Have you no control, Ross?
That's a different issue.
The point is, when the baby comes,
I will be there to feed her...
...and bathe her and change her.
And more than that, I want to do all those things.
 You don't need me to live with you.  Yes!
Yes. You're gonna be so missed.
 You'll be a great father.  You'll be a wonderful grandma.
Hello? I still don't know what the hell I'm doing!
Every firsttime mother feels that way.
You're gonna pick it up.
Hey, you will. Look, when you first came to the city...
...you were this spoiled, helpless little girl
who still used Daddy's credit cards, remember?
I hope you're going somewhere with this.
Look at you. You're this big executive.
You are much more capable than you give yourself credit for.
I have no doubt you're gonna be an incredible mother.
 Really?  I'm telling you.
Thank you.
All right, you two. I'm gonna get going.
No, sweetheart, you stay put.
I'll let myself out.
It's like I'm not here. Which I almost wasn't.
You're just so funny. You're so funny.
What do I do?
Nothing. You have apologized to her, like, a million times.
And she's been nothing but terrible to you.
And don't forget, you just threw her daughter
a lovely, albeit slightly boring, shower.
And she hasn't even thanked you for it.
You know what? You're right.
If you wanna say anything to her, tell her off.
Really?
Okay, I will.
Mrs. Green?
Mrs. Green?
It is rude to leave a party without saying goodbye to the host.
And also, when someone apologizes to you,
the decent thing to do is to accept it.
Because what I did to you, it wasn't on purpose!
But what you're doing to me now is plain spiteful.
 Spiteful?  That's right.
Maybe it's time you took a good, hard look in the mirror, young lady!
Old lady!
Lady!
Wrap it up. Wrap it up. Wrap it up.
So whenever you're ready to apologize to me, I will forgive you.
Good day.
I can't feel my legs!
You were fantastic! I'm so proud of you.
 Yeah? I'm proud of me too.  You should be.
 Could you get me something to drink?  You got it!
Mrs. Green? Okay, I'm really sorry!
I apologize. If you...
Okay! I bit my tongue!
But I'm still really sorry!
 Okay, I'm ready.  You sure?
Yes. I've done my studying, and I really know my stuff.
All right, then.
Rachel Green, let's play Bamboozled!
How do you test the temperature of the baby's bath water?
 Put your elbow in it.  Excellent!
How do you put a baby down for a nap?
Full, dry, on its back, no loose covers.
That's correct!
This is an audio question.
What do you do when a baby makes this sound:
Check if it's wet, check if it's hungry, burp it!
Excellent! Excellent!
Now do you want another question or a Wicked Wango Card?
 A card! A card! I pick a card!  Oh, I'm sorry.
You've been Bamboozled! You're gonna be a terrible mother!
I've lost sight of why we're doing this!
 Hey, you guys. I got some bad news.  What?
That's no way to sell newspapers.
Try, "Extra! Extra! Read all about it!"
No. Monica's restaurant got a horrible review in the Post.
I didn't want her to see it,
so I ran around and bought all the copies I could find.
This is bad. And I've had my bad share of bad reviews.
I still remember my first good one, though:
"Everything else in this production of Our Town
was simply terrible.
Joey Tribbiani was abysmal."
Oh, my God! Look at all the newspapers.
It must be a good review. Is it great?
Oh, dear God.
But the good news is, no one in a twoblock radius
will ever know.
 What about the rest of Manattan?  They all know.
Oh, my God, this is horrible. I'm so humiliated.
Yeah, but you know what they say, Mon,
there's no such thing as bad press.
You don't think that umm, "The chef's Mahi Mahi was awful awful,"
is bad press?
I didn't write it.
 God, is he right? Am I awful?  Oh, no!
Monica, you listen to me, okay?
I'm not just saying this because I'm your friend.
I'm saying it 'cause it's the truth.
Your food is abysmal!
Friends S08E21 The One With The Cooking Class
 Ross?  What? What?
 I am freaking out!  Are you?
My due date is in one week!
 What are you doing up?  That is seven days.
Okay, look. I had a lot of water before I went to bed.
 Can we do this after...?  No, no, no, no, Ross!
Please, come on we do not have any of the big stuff we need!
We do not a changing table! We do not have a crib!
We do not have a diaper service.
Funny you should mention diapers.
 I'm serious.  There's nothing to worry about.
We have plenty of time.
There's a great baby furniture store on west 10th.
Tomorrow, we will go there
and we will get you everything that you need. Okay?
Okay. Thank you. That's great. Thank you.
Wait! Where on west 10th? Because there's this
really cute shoe store that has like this little...
Okay. If you're gonna do this,
then I'm gonna go do that, so...
Wait, Ross! I'm sorry, one more thing.
Yeah.
Our situation, you know, what we mean to each other...
...and, I mean, we're having this baby together
and we live together...
Isn't that...? Isn't that weird?
I'm just kidding. You can go pee.
Hey, Monica, I can't remember.
Did we say we were gonna meet here or at the movie?
We said at the movies, but...
Okay, I'll see you there.
Joey, now that you're here...?
I'll hang out till I have to meet you.
How come you're not going?
I can't. I've got a job interview I have to get ready for.
I thought you already have a job.
And they say you don't pay attention.
No, this is a much better job.
It's vice president of the company
that does data reconfiguration
and statistical factoring for other companies.
Wow. How do you know how to do that?
That's what I do now.
 Joey? Come taste this.  What is it?
Remember the guy that gave me a bad review? Well...
I'm getting my revenge.
You cooked him?
No. He teaches a course on food criticism at the New School,
so before we go to the movies I wanna go by there
and make him try my bouillabaisse again.
I can't wait to read the front page of the Post tomorrow:
"Restaurant reviewer admits: I was wrong about Monica."
The front page?
You really do live in your own little world, don't you?
Do you want these things delivered,
Mr. And Mrs. Geller?
 Oh, no, no.  No, no.
 We're not married.  We are having a baby together
but we're not involved.
I mean, we were seeing each other a while ago...
...but then we were just friends,
and then there was one drunken night...
Or, yes, stranger, we'd like this delivered, please.
 Why don't you fill out this address card?  Oh, okay.
 I notice you picked out a lot of dinosaurs items.  Yeah.
Actually, that's one of the reasons why we're not a couple.
I chose those. I'm a paleontologist.
Really? That is so cool.
Don't get too worked up over it.
It sounds like he's a doctor, but he's not.
No. I'm fascinated by paleontology.
Have you read the Walter Alvarez book?
Yeah. I teach it in my class.
Oh, my god. Standing at a cash register,
I'm holding a credit card, and I'm bored.
I love your neighborhood.
There's a great gym right around the corner from your building.
 That's my gym.  I could tell you work out.
A paleontologist who works out.
You're like Indiana Jones.
I am like Indiana Jones.
 Hi, Pheebs.  Hey! Oh, how did baby shopping go?
Great! We got everything we needed.
Oh, and Ross almost got something that wasn't on the list.
A whore.
What?
We were paying for our stuff,
and this sales woman just started flirting with him.
Can you believe that?
 Did she know you two weren't married?  Yeah.
Oh, my God.
Well, the idea... A woman flirting with a single man?
 We must alert the church elders.  No.
You don't understand. You didn't see how brazen she was.
 Sounds like you're jealous.  No, I'm not.
I just think it's wrong.
I mean, here I am, about to pop...
...and he's out picking up some shopgirl at SlutsRUs?
Is that a real place?
Are they hiring?
Hey, Phoebe. Fatty.
Chandler, why so fancy?
Well, I got a job interview. It's kinda a big deal too.
It's a lot more money
and I'd be doing data reconfiguration and statistical factoring.
I think I know someone who does that.
Me. I do that.
So, seriously, do I look okay? I'm nervous.
Oh, yeah. You really look great.
You know, just don't get your hopes up.
 Why not?  Well, the interview.
 What about it?  You know.
You don't make a very good first impression.
 What?  Oh, you don't know.
Are you serious?
Yes, when I first met you, you were like:
I was like:
What is it that I do?
It's just, like, you're trying too hard, always making jokes...
You just come off a little needy.
Did you like me when we first met?
Chandler, I'm not gonna lie to you.
But I am gonna run away from you.
Hi. I'm Monica Geller, chef at Allessandro's.
Still?
I think the things that you said about me are really unfair,
and I would like for you to give my bouillabaisse another chance.
I don't see why I'd do that to myself again.
Either eat it or be in it.
Spoon?
 So what do you think?  I'm torn...
...between my integrity and my desire to avoid a beating.
But I must be honest.
Your soup is abysmal.
Thatta girl!
We should get out of here, there's a new class coming in.
Welcome to Introduction to Cooking.
Now, before we start,
Can anyone tell me the difference between
hollandaise and bearnaise sauce?
 I can.  Okay, go ahead.
Well, they both have a egg yolk and butter base.
But a bearnaise has shallots,
chervil, and most importantly, tarragon.
Very good. What's your name?
Monica.
 Monica, You go to the head of the class!  Okay!
This stuff takes up a lot of room.
How serious are you about keeping Ben in your life?
My son? Pretty serious.
Hi, Katie. What are you doing here?
The delivery went out to you and I realize they forgot this.
It must have been obvious,
since it was the only thing left in your store.
Listen, to be honest,
home deliveries aren't really part of my job description.
Oh, I actually came here to ask you out.
Oh. Wow. Yeah, that sounds great.
I'm just gonna put this back in my pocket
and pretend that didn't happen.
Yeah, actually I'm free now. You want to get coffee..?
 Sure.  Horny bitch.
No, you're a horny bitch!
No, you're a horny bitch!
No, you're a horny bitch!
You guys go and have a good time.
I'm just gonna grab my coat. And my whip.
You know, because of Indiana Jones.
Not because I'm into S & M.
I'm not into anything weird, you know?
Just normal sex.
So I'm gonna grab my coat.
So you had a good day, huh?
Big commission, picked up a daddy.
Are you okay with this?
Oh, yeah. Yeah, please. You guys have fun.
 Okay.  Yeah.
Nice to see you.
Oh, and it was great to see you too. And you look fantastic.
 Although you missed a button.  Oh, actually, I...
Oh, okay, I see what you're doing there.
I can't even believe this. I really come off that badly?
It's okay. You calm down after a while...
...and then people see how wonderful you really are.
Good. Because I'm sure this interview will last weeks.
All right, don't freak out, okay? I will help you.
 How long before you have to leave?  An hour.
 I can't help you.  Phoebe...
Alright, we'll do our best, okay?
So let's say that I'm the interviewer
and I'm meeting you for the first time.
 Okay.  Hi. Come on in. I'm Regina Phalanges.
 Chandler Bing.  Oh, Bing.
What an unusual name.
You should meet my Uncle Bada.
I'll let myself out.
Your Fettuccini Alfredo looks a little dry,
did you use all your cheese?
When you say "use,"
do you mean "eat as a precooking snack"?
 And the cream?  Cheese makes me thirsty.
 Okay. Let's move on.  All right.
Something smells good over at Monica's station.
My God! This is absolutely amazing!
You've never made this before?
Oh, no. I don't know anything about cooking.
I had to ask what it was called when the water makes those bubbles.
Hats off to the chef.
I'm sorry. Your mouth was full. I didn't hear what you said.
 Hats off to who now?  The chef!
That's right!
I think you'll find if I come to work here, I don't micromanage.
I don't shy away from delegating.
That's good to know.
But let's stop focusing on what you don't do...
...and focus on what you do do.
What I do do...
is manage to create an atmosphere of support
for the people working with me.
I see. Nice sidestep on the "do do" thing by the way.
Hardest thing I've ever done in my life.
Oh, you gotta go!
 Don't worry. You're ready.  Really?
Absolutely! Just fight all your natural instincts,
and you'll be great.
Monica, my star student.
You called me that before,
so I took the liberty and fashioned a star out of aluminium foil.
Now, no pressure.
If you like my cookies, you give me the star.
Wow, a star!
I know you all hate me, and I'm sorry, but I don't care.
 Okay, Joey, you're up next.  Yeah.
Oh, my God! This is amazing!
You get an A.
I got an A? In school? Hey, I'm a dork!
Joey, I'm so proud of you.
 I think you should give him your star.  Excuse me?
He doesn't know what he's doing.
We're all beginners here. Nobody knows what they're doing.
I do. I'm a professional chef!
Oh, relax. It's not a courtroom drama.
If you're a professional chef,
why are you taking Introduction to Cooking?
Yeah!
I'm sorry. I cook at this restaurant, Allessandro's...
...and I just got a really bad review.
Allessandro's?
 I love that place!  You do?
Yes, you're an excellent chef. As a person you're a little...
Oh, I'm totally crazy, but you liked the food?
Very much.
Okay, then. I don't stink. I'm a good chef! Okay.
I don't want to go. I'm having fun.
Actually, did either of you pay for this class?
Hey, if my friend says it's time to go, it's time to go!
Also, I was the point person on my company's transition
from the KL5 to GR6 systems.
You must have had your hands full.
That I did. That I did.
So let's talk a little bit about your duties.
My duties?
All right.
You'll be heading a whole division,
so you'll have a lot of duties.
 I see.  But there'll be 30 people under you...
...so you can dump a certain amount on them.
 Good to know.  We could go into detail...
No, don't, I beg of you.
All right. We'll have a definite answer for you on Monday.
But I can say with some confidence, you'll fit in well here.
 Really?  Absolutely.
You can relax. You did great.
Yeah, I gotta say thank you, I was really nervous.
I'm told I come on too strongly, too many jokes.
And then it was really hard to sidestep that "duty" thing.
Duties?
Doodies?
Poo?
Poo?
Oh, my God. This doesn't count. Okay?
The interview was over.
That was the real Chandler Bing in there.
This is just some crazy guy out in the hall.
Call security! There's a crazy guy out in the hall!
Poo?
I'll look forward to your call.
 You're back from your date.  How are you?
I'm fine. But that's not important.
What's important is how was she?
It was fun. We just had coffee.
Oh, uhhuh, uhhuh, coffee, a little rubrubrub under the table?
What's going on? Do you not like Katie?
No. No, she was nice.
I mean, she was a little slutty, but who isn't?
Well, I liked her.
Of course you did, Ross.
You'd date a gorilla if it called you
Indiana Jones.
Did you get a fresh batch of pregnancy hormones today?
No. It's just that... Katie bothered me.
Why? What was wrong with her?
There was nothing wrong with her, all right?
She was perfectly lovely.
Okay. So, what's the matter?
I don't want you to date her.
Why? What, are you jealous?
Yes. And not because I want you to go out with me.
Because I don't want you to go out with anybody.
I know it's a terrible thing to even think this
and it's completely inappropriate...
but I want you to be at my constant beck and call,
24 hours a day.
I'm very sorry, but that is just the way that I feel.
 Okay.  What?
I won't date. I'll...
I'll be here with you all the time.
Really?
But I'm being so unreasonable.
True, but you're allowed to be unreasonable.
You're having our baby.
Oh, Ross, thank you. Thank you.
You feel better?
No, not really. You're pressing the baby into my bladder...
...and now I have to pee.
 Okay.  Rach?
 Yeah?  Just one thing...
We live together. You're having our baby.
I'm not gonna see anybody else.
Are you sure you don't want something more?
Wow. I don't know, maybe...
Oh, Rach, I was just messing around.
Like you did last night when I had to pee?
Oh! I knew that.
I knew that! I was just messing with you too!
Okay. Because for a minute you seemed...
 No, it's just... ...like you actually...
That's just because I'm such a good messer!
 Rach?  Yeah?
 The bathroom?  Right.
I had a great time. I learned how to bake, ate great food.
It's my first A since 7th grade and...
I didn't even sleep with the teacher this time.
 Oh, look. Acting for Beginners.  Yeah.
 Wanna feel good about yourself?  What the hell!
All right. Let's start with some basics.
Can anybody tell me what the difference
between upstage and downstage is?
Yeah, this was a stupid idea.
What are you guys looking at?
It's a poster for that WWI movie I'm in. Check it out.
Wow! It looks really violent!
I know. I'm coming soon to a theater near you.
I'm in THX. I'm unsuitable for children!
I cannot wait to see this.
Yeah, yeah. It's generating Oscar buzz.
 I started that!  I thought I did!
Guess what? I just talked to my agent...
...and the premiere is next week and you're all invited!
 Will we take a limo?  Sure! Why not?
I love taking limos when nobody died.
Well, obviously I won't be able to come.
For those who haven't checked their calendars,
today's my due date.
I just want take a moment and thank you guys
for how great you've been during this time.
I really couldn't have done it without you.
I loved these last 9 months.
Even though I'm looking forward to the next part...
...I am really gonna miss being pregnant.
That's right. Still no baby.
Come on, people, make some room.
Sweetie, maybe you'd be more comfortable here.
You.
Like you haven't done enough.
I know how miserable you are.
I wish there was something I could do.
I wish I were a sea horse.
Because with sea horses, it's the male. They carry the babies.
And then also, I'd be far away in the sea.
God.
I have never been so uncomfortable in my entire life.
I know. I've been there. I remember toward the end...
Phoebe, that's a great story.
Can you tell it to me when you're getting me some iced tea?
Oh, God, get out! Get out, get out, get out!
Let's.
Hey, did you have the baby yet?
Do you want me to come over there and sit on you?
Because I'll do it.
What are you doing here so early?
They sent me home from work.
They said, "Start your maternity leave now. Just rest."
Get ready for the baby. You know what? Screw them!
If they don't want me there,
I'll hang out with you guys.
Or you could do volunteer work.
 Hello?  Joey, it's Estelle.
Great news. I was able to get you
and one guest tickets to your premiere.
One guess? You told me I could have six tickets.
Well, I sold four of them on eBay.
You'll be sitting next to HotGuy372.
Oh, my god. So that's it? I only get to bring one guest?
Yeah. What time you wanna pick me up?
Hello?
You hear that?
I only get one extra ticket to my premiere.
So somehow I have to pick between you three and Ross.
 What about me?  You said you didn't want to go.
I don't. But I would still like to be acknowledged.
Because I'm pregnant, I'm invisible?
Definitely not invisible.
Ross didn't care enough to be here, so I think he's out.
You snooze, you lose.
He's not snoozing. He's teaching a class.
Well, then somebody's snoozing.
And, Joey, not that this should affect you at all,
but if you pick me...
...I was planning on wearing a sequin dress cut down to here.
I haven't seen this dress.
Star in a movie.
Joey, you pick whoever you want.
Listen to your heart.
What does it tell you?
Phoebe. Phoebe. Phoebe.
Well...
I think I want to take Chandler.
Phoebe, Phoebe, Phoebe.
You want to take me?
Yeah, I'm sorry. I wish I could take everybody.
But Chandler's always supported my career.
He's paid for acting classes, headshots and stuff.
This will be my way of paying you back.
So you're never actually going to pay me back?
Just because he paid for your headshots, you're gonna take him?
I don't think you're comprehending just how slutty this dress is.
It's not just the stuff he paid for.
It's everything, you know?
He read lines with me.
He went with me on auditions when I was nervous.
Then he consoled me after I didn't get parts that I really wanted.
You always believed in me, man,
even when I didn't believe in myself.
I always knew you were gonna make it.
I'm so proud of you.
Thanks, that means a lot to me.
Mon, maybe one of these guys wants to wear your dress.
I'm gonna go shave.
Yeah, well, I'm gonna go spit.
I have to pee.
If I don't come out in five minutes,
it's because I've choked to death on the potpourri stink.
When she comes out, you hold her nose,
I'll blow in her mouth and the kid'll just... right out of her.
She's over a week late. She's got to have it today, right?
I don't know. I think it's still gonna be a while.
Care to make it interesting?
I bet you she'll have it by this time tomorrow.
You're on.
 Okay, how much?  One hundred thousand dollars.
How about 50 bucks?
Fine, I'll call Zurich and move some money around.
All right, whose turn is it to help me get up?
No one's here.
Oh, damn it!
This is so exciting. So glamorous!
People taking our picture. How do I look?
 A little tall.  What?
Would you crouch down a bit so that I look taller?
There you go.
It's just so glamorous.
Oh, hey, Mon? Rach is here.
And you're still pregnant.
I'm sorry. I know how uncomfortable you are.
You know what? You look great.
Yeah, like 50 bucks.
I have to go pee.
Apparently this baby thinks my bladder is a squeeze toy.
Damn it. Here's your 50 bucks.
That's interesting that you lost.
Now, I forget, do you like to lose?
All right, stop it.
 Double or nothing she has it by tomorrow.  Fine, you're on.
Until then, General Grant,
why don't you set up camp... right there?
Is Rachel here? We have a doctor's appointment.
She's in the bathroom.
 Rach, we gotta go.  In a minute!
People ask me why we're not together.
I just don't know what to tell them.
All right, all right, let's go.
Do you want to go change first?
The doctor's staying open late for us, but if you hurry...
No, I'm fine.
You don't think that's a little inappropriate?
 What?  Good God, man. Don't anger it.
Ross, it is 100 degrees outside.
For the first time in weeks, I am...
Fine. Whatever you want.
You're the mommy.
No! Don't call me "Mommy."
It's bad enough you call your own mother that.
I'm actually with her on this one.
I thought I knew who the enemy was, but it was you all along.
Okay, this is it. This is my big fight scene coming up.
I'm fighting for every man in the 82nd Ground Division.
Ross? Can I ask you something?
When Carol was pregnant with Ben...
...were you this irritating?
 Excuse me?  Nothing. You're just...
You've been a little short with me lately.
I'm not trying to irritate you.
Well, then, you must have a natural talent for it.
You know what? The doctor will be in soon.
Why don't we not speak until then?
Okay.
Seriously. Breathe louder, Ross. That's great.
We should ask the doctor if she even knows...
...how to deliver a baby that's half human, half pure evil!
Hi, Dr. Long. How are you?
You're nice to her.
She has the drugs.
 We'll do a quick check.  Okay.
 So eight days late, huh?  Yeah.
You must be getting a little uncomfortable.
Yeah, just a tad.
You're 80% effaced. So you're on your way.
It still could last a while longer.
If you're anxious, there are ways to help things along.
Do them!
Actually, they're things that you can do.
Just some home remedies.
In my experience, I've found some are very effective.
Well, we are ready to try anything.
Okay. There's an herbal tea you can drink.
You can take some castor oil. There's spicy foods.
Great. We will do all of those.
 Taking a long walk.  Good. Done.
And there's the one that's proved most effective: Sex.
You've got to be kidding me!
Good job, Joe! Well done! Topnotch!
 You liked it? You really liked it?  Oh, yeah!
Well, which part exactly?
The whole thing! Here we go!
No, no, no. Give me some specifics.
I loved the specifics. The specifics were the best part.
Hey, what about the scene with the kangaroo?
Did you like that part?
I was surprised to see a kangaroo
in a World War I epic.
You fell asleep!
There was no kangaroo!
They didn't take any of my suggestions!
Thanks a lot for coming. See you later.
Don't go. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
Look, this guy fell asleep!
He fell asleep too! Be mad at him!
Or call an ambulance!
What did the doctor say?
Any news on when the baby will come?
No. She gave us ideas on how to induce labor.
We tried them all.
We went for a walk, we tried special tea,
castor oil, spicy food. Nothing has worked.
There is one thing we didn't try.
But someone thinks that that will open up a can of worms.
What is it? What is it?
If it's gonna help bring the baby here, today...
I mean, I think you should do it.
 It's sex.  Do it!
 Monica.  It's been a really long time for you.
I mean, women have needs.
Do it. Get yours.
Oh, I don't know about that.
I think if the two of you had sex,
the repercussions would be catastrophic.
All right, let's be practical.
If Ross isn't willing to do it,
he's not the only guy in the world you can have sex with.
You could borrow Chandler. Chandler is good.
Monica, what is the matter with you?
Nothing. I just want the baby to be born today.
Why? Why today?
Okay, fine.
I keep betting Phoebe that you're gonna have the baby,
and I don't want to lose again.
What? While she's been going through this hell,
you've been making money?
You're betting on your friend staying in this misery?
 I'll take that bet.  What?
I'm miserable here. I may as well make some money out of it.
Can I get some of that action?
Wait a minute. I'm betting against all of you?
Don't worry. I really do feel like tomorrow it's gonna happen.
Okay.
Hey, Sleeping Beauty.
Where have you been? I try to call you.
I want to talk to you. I still feel bad.
Oh, no. Were you upset? Did you lose sleep?
I'm so sorry.
The reason I came over is to settle things between us.
You've done a lot for me in my career.
I wanted to pay you back by taking you to the premiere,
but you missed it.
 So how much do I owe you?  What?
Give me a number. I don't want to owe you anything.
You don't owe me anything.
 I don't want your...  We're doing this!
You got me my first headshots. How much were those?
I don't know, $500.
Okay, $500. What else?
Then there was the second set.
The infamous "booger" headshots.
Okay, so that's another $500.
That's 500 and 500. That's...
 You want a calculator?  Please.
Here.
All right, what else?
Well, there's acting classes, stagecombat classes, tap classes...
Which we're still keeping under our hats.
Then there was that dialect coach who helped you with that play
where you needed a southern accent.
Which, after 20 hours of lessons, still came out Jamaican.
What the hell are you talking about?
The South will rise again, man.
Yes, money wellspent.
Okay, what else? Rent.
Okay. Two, three years of rent, utilities, food...
Okay, so I'm writing you a check for...
So you fell asleep during my movie.
Big deal, right?
How do you clear this thing?
Come on. Finish your enchilada.
Ross, we've tried all the spicy food. It's not working.
Okay, here, have one of these peppers.
Oh, God. So hot. Oh, my God.
By the way, you don't want to touch the pepper
and then touch your eye.
I am feeling nothing.
Speaking of hot, watching you do that...
...really makes me want to have sex with you.
Stop it.
Come on, Ross! Why are we wasting time with all this other stuff?
We know it's gonna work.
It's doctorrecommended.
I'm sorry. But we have to have some boundaries.
My God, I'm dying.
Come on, Ross.
We've done it before. We'll do it again.
It'll be a nice way to bookend the pregnancy.
This is insane. I'm not gonna make love to you
just so you'll go into labor.
Make love? What are you, a girl?
Always a great way to get into a man's pants.
You'll be performing a service, okay?
Think of me as a ketchup bottle.
Sometimes, you have to bang on the end of it to get it to come out.
I love when you talk dirty to me.
I know it. You're right. That's not sexy.
Oh, I seem to have dropped my fork.
Let me just bend over and get it.
Oh, God!
Okay, enough. This is not going to happen.
Come on, Ross. I'm miserable here.
Come on, you started this, now you finish it!
Come on, wuss. Make love to me.
 You know what?  What?
Forget it.
What now, Ross, you're not gonna talk?
How on earth will you ever annoy me?
Oh, wait a minute, I know.
I mean you'd think the damn jalepeno
would've cleared up your sinuses, but no!
That's not enough... What are you doing?
I'm getting that baby out of you!
 Oh, God!  I know.
Oh, no, no, no.
I think my water just broke.
I am good!
Okay, I got the pillow. I got the bag.
 You got the keys?  I got the keys.
We're having a baby.
I didn't have time to read this part of the books,
but do you think we have time...?
 Not so much.  Okay, let's go.
 200.  Thank you.
That's it. I'm done. I don't care when the baby comes.
No more betting.
Okay.
Hello?
Okay.
I guess we could bet one more time.
 Is Rachel having the baby?  How did you know that?
Joey! Chandler! It's time.
They're at the coffee house.
You know everything!
Wait, double or nothing. I bet you the baby is over 7 pounds.
I bet you it has hair! I bet you it's a girl.
We know it's a girl.
I'll give you really good odds.
All right!
Yes! From home to the hospital in under seven minutes! 
We did it.
Yes, the hard part is truly over.
No, but come on, 
we're off to a great start, aren't we?
I knew I'd get here fast.
But this has gotta be some kind of a record!
 Oh, you made it!  Hi.
How the hell did you beat us here?
We took a cab. Did you guys walk?
No, we took a cab too. But I did test runs...
Hey, you made it!
Okay, is there some kind of magic tunnel to this hospital?
Ross, you stay here and talk.
I'm gonna go have a baby.
Okay. Hi, this is Rachel Greene.
I'm Ross Geller. We called from the car.
Right. We have a semiprivate labor room waiting for you, so...
Oh, whoa! I'm sorry. Semiprivate?
We asked for a private room.
Yes, I see that here.
Unfortunately, we can't guarantee a private room.
And, currently, they're all unavailable.
Man, if only you'd gotten here sooner.
I'm sorry. Semiprivate rooms are all we have.
Okay. Just give us a second. Ross?
Yeah?
Give her some money.
I really think they're out of rooms.
They're not, Ross.
They're just saving them for important people!
Okay? What if I was the president?
Well, then, we'd be in a lot of trouble.
You don't know where any countries are.
Okay.
Say, would you mind checking again?
See if any private rooms may have opened up?
This is a hospital.
Okay, you know what? I have to say,
I don't really care for your tone.
And this is not the only hospital in this city,
and we have no problem... Oh, gosh!
 What? What?  Contraction!
Would you like to see a semiprivate room?
Yeah, it couldn't hurt to look.
Friends S08E23 The One Where Rachel Has A Baby
Well, you're only two centimeters dilated,
and we need to get to 10.
 It'll be a while.  Oh, okay.
 I'll be back in an hour to check you again. Thank you.
I guess we have some time to kill.
Yeah, guess so.
Oh, check these out.
Never done this before.
Yeah, well, it looks great.
Thank you very much. I think we're ready to...
Hi, I'm Ross. 
I'm here to ruin this magical day for you.
Oh, no, not at all. It's okay.
Marc Horger. This is my wife, Julie.
Hi, Julie. This is Rachel.
Oh, hi, Rachel.
 Is this your first?  Yeah, it is.
Well, little Jamie here is our third.
So if you have any questions, 
or you need anything at all, just holler.
 That's so sweet.  Yeah.
I opened this earlier but let me give you guys some privacy.
Nonsense. We're all in this together.
We are gonna share every moment of this with you.
 And I think we're gonna have some fun.  Yeah.
 Oh, okay, I guess.  Hey, smile!
 I don't know if...  I really don't want any...
Oh, thank you.
Oh, Ross! Here comes another contraction.
Okay, just breathe.
Oh, honey, I think I'm having one too!
 Here you go!  Oh, no!
Oh, my God!
Hey, look at this.
Oh, wow. Three hours and still no baby.
The miracle of birth sure is a snoozefest.
Hey, you wanna see something?
Sure. What?
This is gonna be fun.
Watch me freak out Chandler.
 Honey?  Yeah?
Listen, I've been doing some thinking...
...and I don't know whether it's because we're here...
...or Rachel's giving birth...
...but I think we should try to have a baby.
Okay.
What's that now?
Okay. I've been thinking about it too, 
and I think we're ready.
Are you kidding me?
You think we're ready to have a baby now?
This is fun.
You're ready to have a baby?
My boy's all grown up!
You said you were ready too.
Yeah, but I was just screwing with you
to try to get your voice all high and weird...
...like mine is now!
Yes, but haven't you wanted a kid, like, forever?
Okay, then, back off, mister!
Because I am ready to have a baby.
I just want Joey to be the father.
What? Are you crazy?
That's it, right there! That's all I wanted!
I am so sorry.
The doctor insisted on closing the curtain for the exam.
Oh, that's very... Really, very, very okay.
Julie's cervix is dilated seven centimeters.
That's about four fingers!
Doctor let me feel it myself.
Have you felt Rachel's cervix, Ross?
 No, we're not gonna do that.  We won't be doing that.
Well, if you like, you could feel Rachel's, 
then feel mine to compare.
Am I interrupting?
Yes! Thank you! Later.
 No, you can't leave me alone with these people. Oh, I'm sorry.
No, Ross? Ross? Ross? My child has no father!
I'm so glad you're here, but it's gonna be a while.
I wish you'd called first.
That's all right. I'm coming back later with your father.
I acturally needed to talk to you before the birth.
Okay. What's up?
I brought something that I want to give you.
Assuming, of course, that you want it.
Ma, you're asking me to marry you?
This is your grandmother's engagement ring.
I want you to give it to Rachel.
Mom, no. Come on. 
 Thank you.  Just hear me out...
No! Okay? We've been through this.
We're not gonna get married just because she's pregnant. Okay?
Honestly, Ross, 
this isn't just some girl you picked up in a bar and humped.
Ross, a child should have a family.
You know what? I can't deal with this right now. I'm sorry.
Just think about it.
If you don't, I'll talk more about humping.
Give me.
 Hi, dear.  Hi. Thank you so much for coming.
Ross, get in here!
She dragged me out of the labor room 
to ask me why I'm not with Rachel.
Yeah.
Why aren't you with Rachel?
You're kidding, right?
Look, we're not gonna be together just because we're having this baby.
But it just seems that you two belong together.
Okay, stop it. I can't deal with this right now.
I have to go have a baby.
Right. And with who again?
He's crazy. Why doesn't he wanna be with Rachel?
I know.
Seriously, she's like the perfect woman.
I mean, I know she turned me down...
...but if she hadrt and she wanted to be with me...
...I would take her in my arms and...
I haven't bummed you guys out like this in a while, have I ?
 Who's that?  New people.
What happened to the Disgustingtons?
They're having their baby.
It's not fair, Ross. I got here first!
Right after you left, they wheeled her off into delivery.
Oh, but not before she gave me a nice, juicy shot of little Jamie
just crowning away.
Wow. Sorry.
So how are the new people?
Well, they have some unusual pet names for each other.
Including "Evil Bitch" and "Sick Bastard."
Oh, gosh, a contraction.
Yeah? Okay, okay. Just breathe.
 Are you looking at her?  No!
Don't you look at her, you sick bastard!
Honey, I swear I wasn't looking at her!
She's in labor.
You like that, you sick son of a bitch?
I'm just gonna...
See? It's because you were looking, you fat pervert.
No, no. I'm sure no one was looking.
Just want some privacy.
You miss your girlfriend?
Just ignore them.
 You okay?  Yeah.
 Ross.  What?
He's looking at me.
You wanna live to see your baby?
Don't you talk to my husband like that, you stupid bastard!
Oh, good God! If you want a baby so bad, just go steal it!
What is going on with you.
Since when are you so crazy about babies?
I'm not crazy about babies. I'm crazy about us.
What?
We've always talked about having babies someday, 
I'm not saying it has to be right now, 
...but I'm starting to think that we can handle it. 
We're good.
We're really good.
We are pretty good.
But nothing has to happen until you're ready.
Well, maybe I'm ready now.
I mean, it's a little scary, but maybe it's right.
What? It's not right!
We're not ready to have a kid now!
What? 
I'm kidding. This is gonna be fun.
So we're gonna try? I mean, we're trying?
We're trying to get pregnant.
I'm not comfortable doing this in front of the babies.
So when do you want to start trying? 
All right, hold on a sec.
 Period math?  Yeah.
Well, we could start trying now.
 Right here?  No, not here.
Maybe here.
It's perfect. We got a lot of time to kill,
and we're in a building that's full of beds!
And it's so clean!
Come on, you stupid machine! Come on!
It ate your money? 
No.
 I'll see you downstairs then.  All right.
Hey, I got one! I got one!
 Oh, up or down?  Oh. Down, please.
I hate to be a ballbuster, but can I just do it?
 Could you press up too?  Sure.
I feel bad for you. I broke my leg once too.
Yeah? How'd yours happen?
Well, it's a long story, it's kind of embarrassing.
Let's just say there was a typographical error with a sex manual.
 How about you?  Car accident.
Let me guess. Some idiot on a cell phone wasn't paying attention?
Yeah. Me.
Oh, hey, that's me.
 Hey, I take it you're just visiting someone.  Yeah.
Well, if you have some time and you wanna visit someone else...
Yeah, I would like that.
Wait! What? No! 
Elevator! No!
You gotta press the button.
The nurse said they're bringing in another woman.
Oh. Is she pregnant yet?
She doesn't need to be.
She'll still have the baby before I do.
 Oh, Ross! Another contraction.  Oh, okay. Here, here.
That's it.
 Oh, that sounded like a bad one.  Yeah, it was.
Mine haven't been so bad. Oh, here comes one now.
Oh, that was a big one.
Excuse me, could you help me with something?
The patient I'm looking for has a broken leg.
He's in a wheelchair. He's early to mid30s, very attractive.
I know who you're talking about.
Great! What room number is he in?
Ma'am, I'm sorry.
That information is restricted to hospital staff.
She's with me. Dr. Drake Ramoray.
Dr. Drake who?
Ramoray. It's Portuguese.
We need that information. I'm a doctor.
A doctor at this hospital?
Damn it, we're losing precious time.
You want this man's blood on your head...?
 Hands.  Hands!
It is absolutely essential that you tell me 
what room the man my assistant described is staying in.
He's a patient of mine. I've treated him for years.
 He's in room 816.  816. Thank you.
 And what is his name?  No.
 I think we found a place.  Okay.
Wait. Wanna set the mood a little?
 Okay. We'll dim the lights.  Okay.
Or turn them out altogether.
No scented candles. Okay, here. There we go.
Okay, okay. Making me sterile, but okay.
Okay. I'm sorry. Oh, wait. Do we have a condom?
Oh, right!
Yes, 98.6. You're gonna be fine.
This is it!
 That's him!  Great. Go get him!
Wait a second. Or maybe you could go in first.
He's not really my type.
Not you. Dr. Drake Ramoray.
You could ask him questions and see what he's like.
People tell doctors everything.
But you said he was this great guy.
Lately all the guys I meet seem nice at first, 
then turn out to be the biggest jerks.
 You do attract some stinkers.  Yeah, I know.
Dr. Long, I've been at this for 17 hours.
Three women have come and gone with their babies.
You gotta give me good news.
How many centimeters am I dilated? Eight? Nine?
 Three.  Just three?
I'm dilated three!
We are moving along, just slowly.
Don't worry, you're doing great.
 I'll be back soon.  Thank you.
You know what? I'm not waiting. 
I'm gonna push this baby out.
I'm doing it. Three centimeters.
That's gotta be like this, right?
Actually, it's more like this.
Oh, stupid metric system.
Oh, my. We're gonna need to take you straight to the delivery room.
Oh, for the love of God!
I'm Dr. Drake Ramoray.
I have a few routine questions I need to ask you.
Really? I've been dealing with Dr. Wells.
I know. I'm a neurologist.
Just to be on the safe side...
...Dr. Wells wanted a more comprehensive overview over your status.
So he sent me.
Dr. Wells is a woman!
That was a test. Good response.
 All right. Full name?  Clifford Burnett.
 Date of birth?  November 16, 1968.
Age?
Can't you figure that out based on my date of birth?
I'm a doctor, not a mathematician.
 I'm 33.  Okay.
 And are you married?  No.
Oh, really? So 33 and single?
Would you say you have commitment issues?
Are all the questions this personal?
Yes.
Well, if you must know, I'm a widower.
 Oh, that's terrible. I'm really sorry.  Yeah.
Do you sleep with women and never call them again?
 No.  Excellent. Excellent.
And finally, are you into any weird stuff, you know, sexually?
 No!  Wrong answer.
 What else? What else?  He's 33.
A widower.
He seemed like a stand up guy.
And he's not into anything weird sexually.
Enter Pheebs!
This room's available. 
Okay! Wait, you listen to me! You listen to me!
Since I have been waiting, four women, that's four,
one higher than the number of centimeters I'm dilated...
...have come and gone with their babies. 
I'm next. It's my turn. It's only fair.
If you bring in one more woman who has her baby before me, 
I'm going to sue you.
Not this hospital. I'm gonna sue you. 
My husband is a lawyer.
 Rach?  You get back on that case, honey!
I don't think the next patient is very far along.
Okay. Well, then bring her in.
Oh, my God!
I can't believe this!
And yet, somehow, it's true.
I mean, this is so great. 
We're gonna be baby buddies!
Squeeze your legs together and cover the baby's ears.
 Hi, sweetie!  Hi, sweetheart.
This is my husband, Sid. I don't think you've met him.
Ross, Rachel, this is Sid.
I nabbed him a year ago at the dermatologist's office.
Thank God for adult acne!
I still can't believe it.
I'm the luckiest guy in the world.
Really?
What'd he say?
You have to speak very loudly, he's almost completely deaf.
 Oh, there you go.  Of course he is.
So, congratulations, you two. 
I didn't even know you got married.
 Oh, we didn't.  What?
We're just having this baby together, but that's all, you know.
Why?
We're just not in that place, you know? 
But we're very excited about this.
Oh. Well, then shut me up.
Just tell me how.
Oh, I feel another one coming.
Previousely on Friends
Seventeen hours, I have been at this.
 How many centimeters am I dilated?  Three.
Just three? I'm dilated three.
 We've talk about having babies someday.  So we're gonna try?
 Right here?  No, not here.
Maybe here.
This is your grandmother's engagement ring.
I want you to give it to Rachel.
 Mom, no.  Ross, this isn't just some girl...
...you picked up in a bar and humped.
 Hey, I take it you're visiting someone?  Uhhuh, yeah.
 Wanna visit someone else?  Yeah, I would like that.
 That's him.  Great. Well, go get him.
Or maybe you could go in first.
Hi, I'm Dr. Drake Ramoray. I have a few routine questions.
Do you sleep with women and never call them again?
Oh, my God.

Should we tell Rachel there's an empty, private room right next door to hers?
We could. Or we could have sex in it.
Well, let me think about that. While I remove my pants.
Okay, mister. Fertilize me.
Does that sound like Janice?
If it's not, then there's two of them.
And that would mean it's the end of the world.
hey
 Hey.  Hi.
I can't believe this is taking so long. How are you doing?
Oh, not bad. You know that feeling when you're trying to blow a Saint Bernard out your ass?
Weirdest thing. Did I hear?
Mother of God, it's true.
Chandler Bing.
Janice.
Notjust Janice. Janice in labor. Contracting and everything.
Oh, this should be easy. I have a very wide pelvis.
You remember, Chandler.
Janice, I didn't know you were pregnant.
Who's the unwitting human whose essence you've stolen?
It's you.
This is yours.
What?
Ha, look how nervous he gets! We haven't slept together in years!
That's funny. Does it hurt? Does the labor hurt?
Okay, I've got one for you. If you had to, which would you rather eat?
A Seeing Eye dog or a talking gorilla?
I'd have to say the talking gorilla.
Because at least I could explain to him that you're making me eat him.
 Oh. Somebody went to college.  Yeah.
Wow. What is it? I'm sorry.
Oh, I'm sorry. It's just my foot itches like crazy.
On. I'll get it.
Wow. I usually get to know a girl better before I let her spoon me.
Relax. It's not like we're forking.
Oh, that's five, Ross. Five women have had five babies...
...and I have had no babies.
Why doesn't she want to come out?
You know what I think it is?I think you made such a nice home for her...
...over the last nine months that she just doesn't want to leave.
Oh. Look at you making up crap for me.
 Oh, God. Ooh, ooh...  Okay. Okay.
Twentyone hours. You're a hero.
Doctor, you gotta do something. You gotta give me drugs...
...or you gotta light a fire up in there and just smoke it out.
Actually, I think you're ready to go to the delivery room.
 What?
  Ten centimeters.You're about to become a mom.
Oh, my God. Okay.
Hahaha, beat you, sucker. Oh, baby.
Oh, my God. That's the doctor who was in my room before.
Oh. Okay, Mr. Percocet.
I'm telling you, the guy from that show was here...
That's him. You know him?
Okay. Okay. I Okay. Um... This
I sent my friend, Joey, in here to find out stuff about you.
Um, if it, you know If it helps, you came off great.
A lot better than I'm coming off right now.
I don't believe this. You got him to pretend he was some fake doctor?
Fake? Excuse me? Hello?
And then you tried to make me think that I was crazy?You're right, that was wrong. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
It's just that I liked you so much. Can we just start over?
I don't think so.
Uh, if I may?Look, Cliff, you told me a lot of personal stuff about you, right?
Now, maybe it would help if you knew some personal stuff about her.
Uh, she was married to a gay ice dancer.
Uh, she gave birth to her brother's triplets.
Oh, oh, oh. Her twin sister used to do porn.
 Joey, we're trying to dial down the crazy.  Right.
Look, we don't really know each other, so it'd be really easy to just forget about this...
...but there seems to be something between us. And I don't know about you...
...but that doesn't happen to me a lot.
 It doesn't happen to me, either.  Me, neither.
 Push.Push.We're gonna push for five more seconds.
Five, four...
Three, two, one. Oh!
Okay, the next contraction should be in about 20 seconds.
 I can't. I can't push anymore.  Sweetie, you're doing great.
Oh, God. Twenty seconds, my ass!
Here we go. Okay, keep pushing.
 Come on.  Push. Wait.
 I see something.  What, you do? You do? Oh, my God.
Don't say "Oh, my God." "Oh, my God," What is that?
That's the baby's buttocks. She's breech.
 Oh, my God. I thought she had two heads. Oh, God.
Is she gonna be okay?
She's gonna be fine.  OK
She's in a more difficult position, so you're gonna have to push even harder now. 
 Okay.  Go. Come on. Go. Go.
Rachel you’re gonna have to push even harder, nothing’s happening!
 I'm sorry, I can't. I can't.  Yes, you can. I know you can do this.
 Let's go.  I can't do it. No, please, you do it for me.no
Let's go. One more time. One final push. Ready? One, two, three.
Good.
 Keep pushing.
Are you okay?
You have no idea how much this hurts.
Keep going! Keep going!
 Here we go.
Oh, oh! She's upside down, but she's coming. She's coming.
 Oh, God!  Oh. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, she's here.
Oh, she's perfect.
 Oh, she's so tiny.
 Where'd she go?  They're just wrapping her up.
Okay. Well, be careful with her, she's really tiny.
Here she is.
Oh, you.
Oh, thanks for coming out of me.
I know. 
Yes. 
Oh, she's looking at me. Hi. I know you.
 Do we have a name yet?  No, not yet.
That's fine. For now we'll just call her Baby Girl Green.
Oh, no. Baby Girl GellerGreen.
Hello, Baby Girl.
Can we come in?  Oh, come on in.
 Oh, there she is.  Oh, she's so beautiful.
Here.
Oh, my God. She's amazing.
Oh, I'm so glad you guys got drunk and had sex.
It's incredible. I mean, one minute she's inside you...
...and then 47 hours later, here she is.
She looks so real.
You know what I mean.
 Okay, my turn. My turn.  Aunt Phoebe.
Yes. Oh, baby. Oh, you're so cute.
Oh, I could squeeze your little head.
I won't.
 Honey, what's the matter?  Nothing. Sorry, I just can't stop crying.
The doctor says it’s completely normal with all the hormones. Plus, youyou’re sleep deprived.
So? You guys are all sleep deprived.
I don't see you weeping because you put your slippers on the wrong feet.
Oh, God.
 What's the matter now?  I was reliving it.
So do you know what you're gonna call her yet?
Oh. Wait a minute, it's not gonna be Baby Girl?I thought that was so original.
Uh, actually, we've narrowed it down to two names.
Yeah, and you know what? I love them both.So why don't you just pick one, and that'll be it.
Wow, um, okay. Uh, everyone?
This is Isabella.
 Hi, Isabella.  Hi.
 What?
  That's not her name.
I'm sorry, she just doesn't feel like an Isabella.
 What was the other one, Ross?  Um, Delilah.
Oh, great. Suddenly she sounds like a biblical whore.
 Ahem, so I guess we're back to Baby Girl.  Yay.
What are we gonna do?
 It's okay, honey. You'll find a name.  Ugh. Easy for you to say.
You already know what your kids' names are gonna be.
 You do?  Yeah. I had them picked out since I was 14.
Oh, no, it's gonna be named after some snack or baked good, isn't it?
 Well, tell us, what are they?  Um, okay. If it's a boy, it's Daniel.
 And if it's a girl?  I don't want to say.
Oh, stop. Tell us. We're not gonna want it.
Okay. It's Emma.
Emma.
See, I don't want it.
 Take it.  What?
She's clearly an Emma.
Oh, honey, but you love that name.
Yeah. But I love you more.
Besides, you know, nothing goes with Bing. So I'm screwed.
Aaron LipmanGuralnick would like to say hello to his future bride.
Wow, he kind of takes your breath away, doesn't he?
He's a keeper.
 How are you feeling?  Oh, you know, I'm fine.
Can I just say, I really admire what you're doing.Just raising her all alone.
Oh, I'm not doing it alone. I have Ross.
Oh, sure. Now.But what happens when he meets somebody else and gets married?
Well, then he gets a divorce. It's Ross.
I'm telling you, Rachel. Listen to Janice.
They all say they're gonna be there, until they start their real family.
That's never gonna happen with Ross.That's what I thought about my first husband.
Now, I'm lucky if my kid gets to spend the weekend with her father...
and the twins and little Ms. New Boobs.
Really?
I hate to be the one to say it...
...but, honey, you two are on your own.
Well, that's, you know, that's...
We've been alone for the last 20 minutes and we're doing okay.
Besides y’know what? II—Maybe we won’t be alone, 
Because lately things have been happening between me and Ross, you know?
And right before I went into labor, we had this kiss. You know?
So it might be the beginning of something.
 Hey, Janice.  Oh, hi.
Oh. Who's this little guy?
 Say hello to Aaron, your future soninlaw.  Oh, no, no. 
 I'm gonna leave you three alone. Okay.
 Man, you see the kid on that nose?
 You know what I was thinking about? 
Um, that kiss before we left the apartment.That was something, huh?
Yeah. Yeah, it really was.
But we, we gotta be careful.
We You know, we can't let that happen again, you know?
Right.
We don't want to go down that road, do we?No. No, of course not. No, that's why I brought it up.
 They didn't have any sodas?  Oh, my God. I'm sorry.
I was talking to this nurse. Completely forgot.
And so it begins.
She in there?
Yeah. She's putting her down now. That's her.
Look at Emma.
I just can’t decide who she looks more alike, you or Rachel?
Oh what are you kidding? She’s gorgeous, it’s all Rachel.
I'm sorry. For the last time, why aren't you two together again?
No, I know. Because you're not in that place.
Which would be fine, except you totally are.
It's complicated, okay?
Yeah, that's true. 
Yeah, you love her. You always have. You have a child together.
There's no right answer.
Look, we've been together. Okay, and then apart.And then together, and then apart.
And now we have a baby.
It's just, if we got together again and it didn't work out?
I could never do that to Emma.
I mean, she came into this world thinking everything Now me.
What, do they put something in the water in this place?
It's just, Rachel and I, we're doing really well right now.
I know. I know. I know. I know, and if you try to make it more you might wreck it.
 Yeah, exactly.  Right.
Or you might get everything you've wanted since you were 15.
Hey
I just saw a woman breastfeeding both of her twins at the same time.
It is like a freak show up here.
 What's the matter?  Nothing.
What is it? Hey?
 Really, it's nothing. I'm...  Rach, come on. What?
I've just been thinking about how my baby and I are gonna be all alone.
What are you talking about: "alone"? What about Ross?
Oh, please. He'll be with his real family. The twins and little Miss NewBoobs.
Okay, how long was I watching that woman?
I'm just saying that, you know...
...someday Ross is gonna meet somebody...
...and he's gonna have his own life.
Right?
Yeah, I guess so.
I just never thought I'd be raising this baby all by myself.
Pretty dumb, huh?
Hey, you listen to me. Listen to me.
You are never, ever gonna be alone.
Okay? I promise I won't let that happen.
Oh, Joey. Oh, sweetie, what would I do without you?
You don't have to worry about that, okay?
Oh, honey, could you grab me my other box of tissues?
They're right on that chair under Ross' coat. Sure.
Oh, my God.
Joey?
Oh, my God.
Okay.

 That was amazing.  I know.
Hey, do you realize that we may have just changed our lives forever?
We may have started our family.
Nine months from now, we could be here...
...having our own baby.
And if not, we got to do it on a bucket.
