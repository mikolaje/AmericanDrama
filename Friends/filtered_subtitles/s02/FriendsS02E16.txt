天啊  这好奇怪012---Man, this is weird.
你有没有发现脆脆船长的眉毛长在他的帽子上012---Ever realize Cap'n Crunch's eyebrows are on his hat?
那就是奇怪的地方012---That's what's weird?
乔伊  那人当了40年的早餐谷片船长012---The man's been captain of a cereal for 40 years.
哇  真恶心012---Whoa, yuck!
怎样012---What?
汤匙  你舔过后放回去012---The spoon! You licked and you put.
你舔过后放回去012---You licked and you put.
对  那又怎样012---Yeah, so?
你没发现这有多恶心吗  那等于是你用我的牙刷012---Don't you see how gross that is? It's like you using my toothbrush!
你用过我的牙刷012---You used my toothbrush?
那是因为 我用红色那根通排水孔012---Only because I used the red one to unclog the drain.
我的是红色那根012---Mine is the red one!
天啊  揭开封印  到处有鬼012---Oh, God! Can open. Worms everywhere!
我们为什么不能用同一根牙刷012---Why can't we use the same toothbrush...
却能用同一块香皂012---...but we can use the same soap?
因为香皂是香皂  那会自我清洁012---Because soap is soap. It's self-cleaning.
下次你洗澡时…012---The next time you shower...
…想想我最后洗什么  而你最先洗什么012---...think about the last thing I wash and the first thing you wash.
《老友记》 第二季 第16集: 乔伊搬家012---Friends S02E16: The One Where Joey Moves Out
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
看看你们这些型男012---Look at you fancy lads!
是什么场合012---What's the occasion?
记得我的电视剧里那个演昏迷不醒的人吗012---You know that guy on my show that's in a coma?
他要请我吃早午餐012---He's having a brunch.
就等你了012---Ready when you are.
真不敢相信你们居然要刺青012---I can't believe you're actually getting tattoos.
打个岔  你们要刺青012---You guys are getting tattoos?
对  但你不能告诉罗斯  因为我想给他惊喜012---But you cannot tell Ross because I wanna surprise him.
好狂放  你要刺什么012---Wow, this is wild! What are you gonna get?
我要刺一朵百合012---I'm getting a lily.
纪念我妈  因为她叫百合012---For my mom, because her name's Lily.
运气真好  假如她叫丑大污点呢012---That's lucky. What if her name was Big Ugly Splotch?
你想刺在哪里  我肩膀上012---Where you getting it?  On my shoulder.
什么012---What?
什么在你肩膀上012---What's on your shoulder?
皮包012---A chip.
刺青  我要去刺青  刺青012---A tattoo. I'm getting a tattoo. A tattoo?
为什么  你为何要这么做012---Why? Why would you wanna do that?
嗨   嗨012---Hi.  Hi.
你不觉得刺青蛮酷的012---You don't think they're kind of cool?
不  抱歉  我不觉得012---No. Sorry, I don't.
为何有人要付钱请师傅  在身上留下一辈子的伤痕012---Why would anyone pay someone to scar their body for life?
假如刺得不对劲呢  菲比012---What if it doesn't come out right?
那就像老是顶着剪坏的发型012---It's like having a bad haircut all the time.
为什么大家都盯着我看012---Why is everyone staring at me?
罗斯  过来签给爸的生日卡  理查快要来了012---Sign this card for Dad. Richard will be here soon.
理查也要参加派对012---Richard's going to the party too?
他是我父母最好的朋友  他非得到场不可012---He's my parents' best friend. He has to go.
那你打算今天告诉他们你们的事吗012---So is today the day you'll tell them about you two?
是啊  我决定送我爸中风当他的生日礼物012---Yeah, for my dad's birthday, I decided to give him a stroke.
不  我想你应该告诉他们012---No, I think you should tell them.
不  我不知道他对我有多认真  在知道前  我什么都不说012---I don't know how serious he is. Until I do, I won't say anything.
很难说  我不认为爸妈会在意012---I don't think Mom and Dad would mind.
记得你9岁  理查30岁时  爸爸老是说…012---Remember when you were 9 and Richard was 30, Dad said:
〝天啊  真希望他们在一起〞012---"God, I hope they get together."
可以进了吗012---ROSS: Shall we?
好  等一下012---Okay, wait.
你知道吗012---You know what?
罗斯  我们换位子  你在中间012---Ross, let's switch places. You get in the middle.
这样看起来像是我们想隐瞒什么012---This looks like we're trying to cover something up.
摩妮卡  就算你你骑着他进去  他们还是不会相信012---You could come in straddling him, they still wouldn't believe it.
我们到了012---We're here!
嗨  孩子们   小孩到了012---Hi, kids! MR.The children!
生日快乐  爸  谢谢012---Happy birthday, Dad. Thank you.
生日快乐012---Happy birthday!
你们两个谢过柏克医生载你们吗012---So you kids thanked Dr. Burke for the ride?
事实上  妈  我想摩妮卡代我们两人谢过他了012---Actually, Mom, I think Monica thanked him for the both of us.
你们是坐火车来的012---So you kids take the train in?
不  理查·柏克载他们来的012---No, Richard Burke gave them a ride.
提到他啊…012---Speaking of whom...
我听说他在城里  跟20岁的无脑嫩妹在交往012---...I hear he's got some 20-year-old twinkie in the city.
手指抽筋  天啊012---Finger cramp! Oh, God!
对不起  来  我来清  妈012---Sorry. Here, let me get that, Mom.
所以说理查在青少年区购物012---So Richard's shopping in the junior section?
我们还在提那码子事012---Are we still on that?
想也知道她的智商  跟餐巾纸一样高012---You just know she's got the IQ of a napkin.
她说不定连漂亮都算不上012---She's probably not even pretty.
只是够年轻  所以一切都还坚挺012---Just young enough so that everything is still pointing up.
你能相信这地方吗012---Can you believe this place?
我了解  这间公寓真棒012---I know. This is a great apartment.
我刚上过洗手间  两侧都装了镜子012---In the bathroom there's mirrors on both sides of you.
你在上时  好像跟火箭女郎一起尿尿012---When you're in there, it's like peeing with the Rockettes.
我的幻想成真了012---Well, there's my fantasy come true.
这是说真的012---Seriously.
嗨012---Hey.
我们正好说到这间公寓真棒012---We were just saying, great apartment!
谢谢  你想租吗012---Thanks. You want it?
我要搬到更大的地方012---I'm moving to a bigger place.
你应该租下这间012---You should take this one.
你能想像我住这种地方吗012---Can you see me in a place like this?
有何不可  你讨厌公园景观和挑高天花板吗012---Why not? You hate park views and high ceilings?
来  我带你参观厨房012---Come on, I'll show you the kitchen.
没关系  我今天早上看过一间厨房012---That's all right, I saw a kitchen this morning.
在电视上012---On TV.
别讲话了  好吧012---Stop talking. Okay!
来吧  告诉我们  她真的20岁吗012---Come on, tell us! Is she really 20?
我什么也不告诉你们012---I am not telling you guys anything.
拜托  理查  今天是我生日  让我想像过那种生活的滋味012---Come on, it's my birthday. Let me live vicariously!
爸  你真的不该这么做012---Dad, you really don't want to do that.
朋友之间谈论下中年危机又怎样012---What's a little midlife crisis between friends?
杰克  你别逼问好吗012---Would you let it go?
我知道你的心路历程  我满50岁时  买了保时捷012---I know what you're going through. When I turned 50, I got the Porsche.
你则得到自己的“小跑车”012---You got your own little speedster.
说真的  不是那样   我告诉你012---Seriously, it's not like that. Tell you what.
也许找个周末  你可以借我的车  而我可以…012---Maybe one of these weekends you can borrow the car and I could...
爸  我恳求你别把话讲完012---Dad, I beg you not to finish that sentence!
什么  我只是开玩笑012---What? I'm kidding!
你知道我绝不会让他碰那辆保时捷012---You know I'd never let him touch the Porsche.
好  瑞秋012---Okay, Rach.
哪一种百合  这种百合还是那种百合012---Which lily? This lily or that lily?
我…  我喜欢这种百合012---Well, I...  I like this lily.
那绽放得更灿烂  就像我妈012---It's more open and that's like my mom.
她有更开放而奉献的精神012---She had a more open, giving spirit.
莱亨鸡012---Foghorn Leghorn!
金发女  你到二号房012---Blond girl? You're in room two.
没那么金发女  你跟我来012---Not-so-blond girl, you're with me.
要开始了012---Here we go! Uh-huh.
你不去012---You're not going.
嗯-哼012---Uh-huh.
跟罗斯说的话有关吗012---Is this because of what Ross said?
不是012---No.
是吧  也许  我不敢相信012---Well, yeah, maybe.  I don't believe this.
你谈这段恋爱都要这样吗  罗斯等于老板012---Is this how this relationship works? Ross equals boss?
拜托  什么年代了  还是1922年吗012---Come on, what is this, 1922?
1922年怎么了012---What's 1922?
只是指很久以前012---Just, you know, a long time ago.
那个年代的男人经常指使女人012---When men used to tell women what to do a lot.
然后有了投票权  这是好事  不过听起来很糟糕012---Then there was suffrage, which was a good thing. But it sounds horrible.
你想要刺青吗012---Do you want this tattoo?
我想  只是罗斯…012---Yes, I do. It's just that Ross...
你的男友是你老板吗012---Is your boyfriend the boss of you?
不是012---No.
你的老板是谁012---Who is the boss of you?
你012---You?
不  你是你自己的老板012---No. You are the boss of you!
大摇大摆走进去  在臀部刺上那刺青012---You march in there and get that tattoo on your hip!
去012---Go!
你还好吗012---How you doing?
我成了无脑嫩妹012---I'm a twinkie!
真的  我成了英雄012---Really? I'm a hero.
真难应付012---This is so hard.
我懂  我也讨厌这样012---Yeah, I know. I hate it too.
听着  也许我们该对他们直说012---Look, maybe we should just tell them.
也许我们该先告诉你父母012---Maybe we should just tell your parents first.
我父母都过世了012---My parents are dead.
天啊  你真好运012---God, you are so lucky!
我是说…你懂我的意思  我懂…012---I mean... Well, you know what I mean.
撑下去  好吗012---Just hang in there, okay?
好  我先出去  好吗  好012---Okay, I'll go out first, all right?
茱蒂  你想上洗手间  真不错012---Judy! Going to the bathroom. Good for you!
谢谢你  理查  感谢你的支持012---Thank you, Richard. I appreciate the support.
亲爱的012---Honey.
看到我的哈蒙基勒博球棒了吗  劳勃不相信我有012---Seen my Harmon Killebrew bat? Bob doesn't believe I have one.
不知道012---I have no idea.
你知道理查在城内  交了个无脑嫩妹吗012---Did you know Richard has a twinkie in the city?
我知道  他焕然一新  像是电影《魔茧》里的一样012---I know. He's a new man. It's like a scene from Cocoon.
我只是无法想像  理查跟无脑辣妹在一起012---I just never would have pictured Richard with a bimbo.
他告诉强尼夏皮洛  她很棒012---He told Johnny Shapiro that she's quite a girl.
其实他告诉强尼 他觉得自己爱上她了012---He told Johnny that he thinks he's falling in love with her.
真的  我从没看过他这么快乐012---Really?  I've never seen him this happy.
所以说  杰克…012---So, Jack...
有没有想过  把我换成更年轻的模特儿012---...ever think about trading me in for a younger model?
当然没有012---Of course not.
跟你一起  我像是交了两个25岁小妞012---With you, it's like I've got two 25-year-olds.
杰克  别这样012---Oh, Jack, stop!
来吧012---MR. GELLER: Come on!
这是我生日012---It's my birthday!
我们别提了好吗012---Can we drop this?
我对那男的公寓不感兴趣012---I am not interested in the guy's apartment.
拜托  我看到  你查看他壁饰的样子012---Oh, please. I saw the way you were checking out his moldings.
你想要它012---You want it.
我为何想要另一间公寓012---Why would I want another apartment?
我已经有我喜爱的公寓012---I've already got an apartment that I love.
你偶尔这么说又不会死012---It wouldn't kill you to say it once in a while.
好  你想听真话  我是在考虑012---All right. You want the truth? I'm thinking about it.
什么  对不起012---What?  I'm sorry.
我28岁了  从来没一个人住过012---I'm 28. I've never lived alone...
我现在的状况是  终于拥有足够的钱012---...and I'm at a place where I got enough money...
我不再需要室友了012---...that I don't need a roommate.
我也不需要室友012---Whoa, whoa, whoa. I don't need a roommate either.
我负担得起自己住在这里012---I can afford to live here by myself.
我也许得每周带个人过来舔一次餐具012---I may have to bring in somebody once a week to lick the silverware.
你为什么这样在意012---Why are you getting so bent out of shape?
我们又不是协议  要永远住在一起012---We didn't agree to live together forever.
我们不是布偶毕特和恩尼012---We're not Bert and Ernie.
你知道吗012---You know what?
假如你是这种感觉…012---If this is the way you feel...
也许你该去租那间公寓012---...then maybe you should take it.
我就是那种感觉  那么也许你该租下来012---That's how I feel.  Then maybe you should take it!
也许我会租012---Maybe I will!
我不介意  太好了！012---Fine with me!  Great!
这样你就能花更多时间  和真正的朋友…012---You can spend more quality time with your real friends...
汤匙相处012---...the spoons!
谁需要补充饮料012---Whose drink can I freshen?
快要切蛋糕了012---Almost time for cake!

我刚亲临真人秀012---Well, I just caught the live show. Ew!
你呀…  怎样？012---Hey there.  What?

理查  理查012---Richard?
你儿子没在跟人交往  对吧  就我所知没有012---Your son isn't seeing anyone, is he?  Not that I know of.
我在想  他能不能  打个电话给摩妮卡012---I was thinking, why doesn't he give Monica a call?
这算是一个点子012---That's an idea.
其实我已经在跟别人交往012---Well, actually, I'm already seeing someone.
喔012---Oh? Oh?
哦012---Oh...
她什么都不告诉我们012---She never tells us anything.
罗斯  你知道  摩妮卡在跟人约会吗012---Ross, did you know Monica's seeing someone?
妈  我生命中有好多人012---Mom, there are so many people in my life.
有些人有在约会  有些人没有012---Some are seeing people and some aren't.
那是水晶吗012---Is that crystal?
那个神秘男子是谁012---So who's the mystery man?
他是个医生012---Well, he's a doctor.
真正的医生012---A real doctor?
不  是肉类医生012---No, a doctor of meat.
他当然是真的医生012---Of course he's a real doctor.
而且他很英俊012---And he's handsome.
很体贴  我知道你会喜欢他012---And he's sweet, and I know you'd like him.
太好了012---Well, that's wonderful.
妈  没关系012---Mom, it's okay.
是的  茱蒂012---It is, Judy.
杰克012---Jack!
你能进来一下吗012---Could you come in here for a moment?
马上012---Now!
找到了  我拿着  爸012---Found it!  I'll take that, Dad.
看来你女儿和理查算是凑成一对012---It seems your daughter and Richard are something of an item.
不可能  他在城里交了个嫩妹012---That's impossible. He's got a twinkie in the city.
爸  我就是那嫩妹012---I'm the twinkie.
你是那嫩妹  她不是无脑嫩妹012---You're the twinkie?  She's not a twinkie!
听着  这是我长久以来  最棒的恋情…012---Look, this is the best relationship I've been in...
拜托  恋情012---Oh, please! A relationship?
对  恋情012---Yes, a relationship!

真的  真的012---Really?
是的012---Yes.
我应该在我生日当天  站着听这种事吗012---Am I supposed to stand here and listen to this on my birthday?
爸  这对我是件好事  你自己说没见过理查这么快乐过012---This is a good thing. You said you've never seen Richard happier.
我什么时候说的012---When did I say that?
在楼上浴室里  就在你对妈妈动手动脚前012---Upstairs in the bathroom, right before you felt up Mom!
祝你生日快乐012---SINGING: Happy birthday to you
祝你生日快乐012---Happy birthday to you
祝你生日快乐  亲爱的杰克012---Happy birthday, dear Jack

不好了012---Oh, no!
消失了  真奇怪012---It's gone! That's so weird.
不知道它怎么会无影无踪012---I don't know how, where it went.
你没刺青  没错012---You didn't get it?
没012---No.
你为什么没有012---Why not?
对不起…对不起012---I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
你怎么可以这样对我  这都是你的主意012---How could you do this to me? This was your idea!
我知道  我本来要刺  但是他拿着这种针头出现012---I know! I was gonna get it, but he came in with this needle.
你知道他们用针头干嘛012---And did you know they do this with needles?
真的  不会吧012---Really? You don't say?
因为我的是由猫味舔上去的012---Because mine was licked on by kittens!
嗨   嗨012---Hey.  Hey.
我很抱歉…012---I'm sorry about what...

我准备了东西要给你012---So I got you something.
塑胶汤匙012---Plastic spoons!
太好了  任你舔  我的朋友012---Great!  Lick away, my man!
在我买真正的汤匙之前  很适合在我的新家使用012---These will go great in my new place till I get real ones.
什么012---What?
我不能老是使用这种东西  这对环境不友善012---I can't use these forever. They're no friend of the environment.
不  我是说你的什么新家012---No, I mean what's this about your new place?
我要搬出去  我们讨论过了012---I'm moving out, like we talked about.
我以为那不是认真的012---I didn't think that was serious.
我以为那只是拌个嘴012---You know, I thought that was just a fight.
对  那是拌嘴012---Well, it was a fight...
可是话题是认真的  记得吗012---...based on serious stuff, remember?
有关我从来没一个人住012---About how I never lived alone or anything?
我想这样对我有益  能帮助我成长…012---I think it would be good for me. Help me to grow...
有的没的012---...or whatever.
那就这样吧012---Well, there you go.
你可以接受吧012---Hey, are you cool with this?
我不想害你进退两难012---I don't wanna leave you high and dry.
进退对我一向都不难012---I've never been lower or wetter.
我会没事的  我要把你的…012---I'll be fine. I'll just turn your...
卧室改成游戏间012---...bedroom into a game room.
把手足球桌摆进去012---Put the foosball table in there.
为什么是你保留这桌子012---Why do you get to keep the table?
我出了一半的钱买下012---I did pay for half of it.
另外一半是我出的012---I paid for the other half.
我告诉你  我们用比赛决定012---I'll tell you what. I'll play you for it.
好  跟你拼了012---All right, you're on.
今天我能抽个两分钟修理你012---I can take two minutes out of my day to kick your ass.
我得的分  会比你妹被上过的次数还多012---Your men will get scored on more times than your sister.
哇  哇  哇  哇012---Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
哪个妹妹012---Which sister?
你会难过  我告诉他们了吗012---So are you sorry that I told them?
不  你爸和我很久没去跑步了012---No. It's been a long time since your dad and I went running.
你们刺了吗  让我看012---Did you get it?
罗斯在吗  他去买彼萨012---Is Ross here?  He went out for pizza.

我们在看什么012---What are we looking at?
蓝色雀斑012---That blue freckle?
这是我的刺青012---That's my tattoo.
