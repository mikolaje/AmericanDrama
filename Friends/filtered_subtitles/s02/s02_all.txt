不可能  她去机场了012---No way. I'm telling you, she went to the airport.
她要去对罗斯下手了012---And she's gonna go for it with Ross.
哇  我的天啊  简直大条啊012---Oh, my God. This is huge. This...
这件事比大条还大条  这简直是…012---This is bigger than huge. This is...
好吧  有什么比大条还大条的012---All right, what's bigger than huge?
就这件事  也对012---Um, this?  Yes.
你们理新发型了012---Guys, you got new haircuts!
对  我们理了  多亏了这位美发大师沙宣菲比012---Yes, yes, we did. Thanks to Vidal Buffay.
因为〝我们的光彩来自您的风釆〞012---Because, you know: "If you don't look good, we don't look good."
我爱死那个声音了012---I love that voice! Ha, ha.
你们大家  喔  瑞秋012---You guys! Oh, oh.
机场  机场  罗斯  有人陪012---Airport. Airport. Ross. Not... Not alone.
茱莉  搂着她012---Julie. Arm around her!
痛  痛  痛012---Unh! Cramp! Cramp! Cramp!
我想她可能是想表达什么012---Okay, I think she's trying to tell us something.
快  快找出句子的动词012---Quick, get the verbs.
你  你012---Ow. You! You!
你不是说他喜欢我吗  你012---You said he liked me! You! You...!
你们这两个慢半拍的012---You slowpokes!
没错  行李全在我们手上012---That's all right, Rach. We got the bags. Uh...
嗨  哈罗012---Hi. Hello.
茱莉  她是我妹妹摩妮卡  他是钱德012---Julie, this is my sister, Monica. This is Chandler.
嘿  菲比  嗨012---Hey. Phoebe, hi. Mwah.
乔伊  你还好吗  哈罗012---Joey, what up?  Hey.
大家注意  这位是茱莉  茉莉012---Everyone, this is Julie. Julie.
噢012---ALL: Oh.
嗨  嗨012---Hi! Hi!
就当我不在场  当我们根本没见过面012---Hi! But I'm not here, you haven't met me.
明天没连坐20小时的飞机  我给人的第一印象会比较好012---I'll make a better impression when I don't have 20 hours of plane on me.
别忘了搭巴士的时间  哦 我的天012---And bus. Oh, my God!
那个大叫的家伙…  吐口水的人012---With the screaming guy... And the spitting.
你们一定得听这件事012---You gotta hear this story.
我们搭了一辆有200年之久的巴士012---We're on this bus that's 200 years old.
最少200年012---Two hundred, at least.
有个家伙… 后来鸡在她大腿上大便了012---And this guy... And the chicken poops in her lap! Ha!
真是对不起012---Oh, I'm so sorry.
我把结局说出来了  是吗012---I just gave away the ending, didn't I?
我刚刚在计程车上  听过这个故事…012---Ugh, I just heard this story in the cab...
然后我就再也忘不了012---...and it is all I can think about.
太令人意外了012---This is amazing. I mean, how...?
怎么会这样子的呢  我们是在同一个研究所012---How did this happen?  Ross and I were in grad school together.
毕业后就没见过面了  我一到中国012---We haven't seen each other since then. I land in China...
你们猜负责的人是谁012---...guess who's in charge of the dig?
茱莉012---Julie!
这不是太妙了吗012---Julie. Isn't that great?
真是妙得让人想踹你一脚  再对着你的脖子吐口水012---Isn't that just kick-you-in-the-crotch, spit-on-your-neck fantastic?
只是一种形容的方式012---It's an expression.
我们只是很快的  来打声招呼012---We just wanted to say a quick hi.
然后我们就要去看宝宝  然后睡一觉012---Then we're gonna go see the baby. Then get some sleep.
现在其实是明晚六点钟  我们的时差012---Yeah, it's 6:00 tomorrow night, our time.
好  千万别告诉我明天会怎样  因为我喜欢惊喜012---Well don't tell us what's gonna happen, though Because I like to be surprised.
再见  再见012---Bye!  Bye.
瑞秋 可以给我咖啡吗012---Rach. Can I get some coffee?
当然好 谢谢012---Sure. Thank you.
嘿  瑞秋…  你跟他说了没  没012---Hey, Rach... Did you talk to him yet?  No.
那就甭想喝012---Then, no.
你在中国到底发生什么事了012---So, what the hell happened to you in China?
上回我们离开这里的时候  你还爱着…012---I mean, when last we left you, you were in love with, you know.
我知道  曾经是那样没错012---I know. I know I was.
可是我心中一直有个声音  在提醒我…012---But there was always this voice inside that kept saying:
〝那是不可能的  你要往前走〞 你知道那是谁的声音吧012---"It's never gonna happen. Move on." You know whose voice that was?
上帝吗012---God?
是你啊  老兄012---It was you, pal.
也许是上帝在模仿我012---Well, maybe it was God doing me.
你说得没错  在她眼里我只是一个朋友  就这样012---You were right. She looks at me and sees a friend. That's all.
然后我就遇到茱莉  我们在一起很棒012---And then I met Julie, and... I don't know. We're having a great time.
要不是你的话  我绝对不可能跟她在一起的012---I never would have gone for it with her, if it hadn't been for you.
嗯  你欠我一个大人情了  大个儿012---Well, you owe me one, big guy.
你的柠檬汁来了012---Here's your lemonade.
我没叫啊012---I didn't order lemonade.
那就拿回去还  不然他们会算钱的012---Oh. Well then you better go take that back. They're gonna charge you for that.
快  快  快 快点 快点012---But... Go, go, go! Come on, come on!
好  你有什么发现012---Okay, so, uh, what did you find out?
他说…012---He said...
他说他们在一起很棒  我很抱歉012---He said they're having a great time. - I'm sorry. - What?
不过  只要你愿意用心看待  还是有一线希望的012---But the silver lining, if you wanna see it...
也就是  这全是他自行决定的…012---...is that he made this decision all by himself...
绝对没有任何外来力量的协助012---...without any outside help whatsoever.
这样怎么会叫一线希望呢012---How is that a silver lining?
必须很用力  才能看到〝一线“希望012---You have to really wanna see it.
讽刺的是  这些家伙都是上体育课时没人愿意挑的012---Ironically, these guys were picked last in gym.
嘿 菲比012---Hey, Pheebs.
知道我在想什么吗  哦，可以012---You know what I'm thinking? Oh, okay.
在想…012---How...
你很久没跟人嘿咻了…012---...it's been so long since you've had sex...
所以你在想  现在有没有什么新花招012---...you're wondering if they've changed it?
不是  不过现在  我真的在想这件事了012---No. Although now that's what I'm thinking.
那你刚才在想什么012---So, what were you thinking?
你帮他们剪了很棒的发型  我在想你也可以帮我剪012---I was thinking you gave the guys great haircuts. I thought you'd like to do mine.
哦  不要012---Oh! No.
有何不可  因为我只是…012---Why not? Because I'm just...
我非常挑剔 而且是令人难以忍受的控制狂012---I'm incredibly anal and an unbelievable control freak.
不 你不是  我知道我不是  不过你是012---No, you're not. I know I'm not, but you are.
我只是不想伤你的感情012---I was trying to spare your feelings.
喂  嗨  你好012---Hello? Oh, hi.
好  罗斯  等一下  茱莉找你012---Yeah, hold on a second. Ross, Julie for you.
喂  嗨012---Hello? Hi.
嘿  有人认识什么好裁缝师吗012---Hey. Anybody know a good tailor?
有衣服要修改吗  不是012---You need clothes altered? No, no.
我只是想找个人拿粉笔在我身上画012---I'm just looking for a man to draw on me with chalk.
去找法兰克 我家的人总是找他012---Go see Frankie. My family's been going to him forever.
我15岁时第一套西装就是他做的 不 等等 是16岁012---He did my first suit when I was 15. No, wait, 16.
不  抱歉  是15岁012---No, excuse me, heh, 15.
好吧  1990年到底是什么时候012---All right, when was 1990?
好吧  只要棉花棒碰到东西  就别继续挖下去了012---Okay, you have to stop the Q-Tip when there's resistance.
好  好的  甜心  我们待会儿见了012---Okay. Okay. Sweetheart, I'll see you later.

她没挂掉012---She didn't hang up.
好吧  不行012---Okay, no.
不  你来挂电话012---No, you hang up.
你  你…012---You. You. Yo...
抱歉  我还以为你是在对我说012---Sorry, I thought you were talking to me.
瑞秋 对不起012---Rachel. Heh. Sorry.
我再打给她   好吧012---I'll just call her back. Okay.
对不起  刚刚断线了012---Hi, sweetie. I'm sorry. We got disconnected.
不 你挂012---No, you hang up.
好吧  我怎么会这样012---Okay, okay, okay. How did this happen to me? How?
一个礼拜前  两个礼拜前  我还好好的012---A week ago, two weeks ago, I was fine.
罗斯只是罗斯  就是一个家伙012---Ross was just Ross. Just this guy.
如今  突然间  他是罗斯…012---Now all of a sudden, he's Ross...
是我无福拥有的好家伙012---...ugh, this really great guy that I can't have.
以前我也希望你能拥有他012---Sweetie, I wanted you to have him too.
我知道012---I know you did.
我会熬过去的012---Ugh. I'm just gonna deal with it. I'm just gonna deal with it
我得离开这里012---I gotta get out of here!
我不管你们怎么说  她真的有心事012---I don't care what you guys say. Something's bothering her.
知道吗  我想我当年是16岁012---You know, I think I was 16.
拜托  只要后面修一点点就好012---Please, just a little bit off the back.
我还是〝不要〞012---Um, I'm still on "no."
早  嘿012---Uh, morning. Hey.
你们可以先闭上眼睛吗012---Could you close your eyes for a sec?
不  不  不  我不会再上你的当了012---Oh, no, no, no. I'm not falling for that again.
怎么了  我昨晚做了一件傻事012---What's going on? I sort of did a stupid thing last night.
什么傻事012---What stupid thing did you do?
巴洛  你去穿好衣服  然后就可以走了  再见012---Why don't you just go get dressed... ...then you'll be on your way. Bye-bye.
瑞秋  怎么会这样012---Rachel, how did this happen?
我昨晚刚巧遇到他了012---I don't know, I kind of ran into him last night.
在哪里遇到的  他的公寓  这是果汁吗012---Where?  At his apartment. Is this juice?
喂  你忘了你甩他是因为他想钓菲比012---Whoa. And the fact that you dumped him because he hit on Phoebe?
哦  天啊  我晓得  我真可悲  我是个没用的人012---Oh, God, I know. I'm pathetic, I'm a loser.
你不可悲  你只是悲伤012---Honey, you're not pathetic. You're just sad.
伤心人总是会做傻事的012---Yeah. People do stupid things when they're upset.
我的天  如果我因每个我不该上床的人而都得到五毛钱…012---My God, if I had a nickel for every guy I wish I hadn't...
我们现在谈的是你犯下的大错012---But this is about your horrible mistake.
嗨  嘿012---Hi. Hey!
嗨  抱歉我们迟到了012---Hi... Sorry we're late.
我们刚刚在…012---We were, uh...
哦  是跟触摸有关的012---Well, there was touching.
嘿   罗斯  巴洛012---Hey, Ross! Paolo. Ha.
搞什…嗯…012---What a...
你来这里干什么012---What, uh...? What are you doing here?
我来上瑞秋012---I do Raquel. Ah.
这么说他回来了012---So, uh, he's back?
对  他回来了  有问题吗012---Yeah, he's back. Is that a problem?
不  没有问题012---No, not a problem.
很好  很欣慰不构成问题012---Good. Glad it's not a problem.
你必须别碰我的屁股012---Okay, you're gonna have to not touch my ass.
嗯  尽管有美味的贝果  以及触手可及的紧张局势存在…012---Well, despite the yummy bagels and palpable tension...
我还是得去改我的长裤012---...I've got pants that need to be altered.
看到法兰克的时候  跟他说乔伊崔比亚尼问候他012---Oh, when you see Frankie, tell him Joey Tribbiani says hello.
这样子他就会懂了012---He'll know what it means.
你确定他能解开如此深奥的谜题012---You sure he's gonna be able to crack that code?
真好玩  巴洛上次在这里时  我的头发还很短很可爱012---It's funny. The last time Paolo was here, my hair was so much shorter and cuter.
好吧012---All right. Okay.
但你得保证  你不会管太多  太唠叨…012---But... But! You have to promise that you will not be all controlly and bossy...
还有别太摩妮卡就是了012---...and all, you know, Monica about it.
我保证  好  我看看012---I promise. All right, let's see.
好  你们有些会被修剪  有些不会012---Now, some of you are gonna get cut and some of you aren't.
不过我保证  你们全都不会感到痛楚012---But I promise, none of you will feel a thing.
好012---Okay.
够了  我不干了   干嘛  我什么也没说012---All right, that's it. I quit. What? I didn't say anything!
但这不是相信人的表情012---Yeah, but this isn't the face of a person who trusts a person.
这种表情是…012---This is the face of a person who, you know...
不相信人的表情012---...doesn't trust a person.
我很抱歉 我很抱歉012---I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Phoebe.
只是这比我们讨论的发型  短多了012---It's just a little shorter than what we had discussed.
你放轻发好吗  我知道自己在做什么012---Would you relax? I know what I am doing.
这就是那位先生的发型012---This is how he wears it.
哪位的发型  黛咪·摩尔012---How who wears it? Demi Moore.
黛咪·摩尔不是〝先生〞012---Heh. Demi Moore is not a he.
哦  他在《二八佳人花公子》 和《十全十美》中是个〝先生〞啊012---Well, he was a he in Arthur and in 10.
那个人是杜利·摩尔012---That's Dudley Moore!
我说的是  我要黛咪·摩尔的发型012---I said I wanted it like Demi Moore!
哦  哦  哦  我的天啊012---Oh. Oh! Oh, my God!
哦  天啊  哦  我的天啊012---Oh, God! Oh, my God!
哦  我的天  我很抱歉012---Oh, my God! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
黛咪·摩尔是哪一个啊012---Which one is Demi Moore?
她是《桃色机密》 《桃色交易》 和《第六感生死恋》那个女星012---She's the actress that was in Disclosure, Indecent Proposal, Ghost!
她的发型很棒的  我知道012---Oh, she's got gorgeous hair. I know!
我的天啊012---Oh, my God!
裤管的褶边要多长  要跟这件长裤的存活期一样长012---How long do you want the cuffs? At least as long as I have the pants.
我刚听懂012---I just got that.
现在要量你的内侧长度012---Okay. Now we'll do your inseam.
她的情况怎样  现在还很难说012---How is she? It's too soon to tell.
她在休息了  起码这是一个好现象012---She's resting, which is a good sign.
头发的情况呢  我不想骗你012---How's the hair? I'm not gonna lie to you, Ross.
看起来不妙012---It doesn't look good.
我有夹起一边 似乎能阻止卷曲情况012---I put a clip on one side, which seems to have stopped the curling.
我们可以去看她了吗012---Can we see her?
你的发型看起来太棒了  反而会让她更难过012---Your hair looks too good. It would upset her.
罗斯  何不由你进去看她012---Ross, why don't you come on in.
你还好吗  我没事012---Well, how you doing? I'm okay.
那么糟吗   什么012---Ooh, that bad, huh?  What?
我可以感受到女性挫折与无助的时刻012---Look, I can sense when women are depressed and vulnerable.
这是我的天赋之一012---It's one of my gifts. Sit.
乔伊  当我看到他跟她下机的那一刻…012---Ugh, Joey, when I saw him get off that plane with her...
我真的以为我已经沉到谷底了012---...I really thought I just hit rock bottom.
可是今天的感觉就像是有个谷底…012---But today, it's like there's rock bottom...
然后下面还有50英尺的垃圾…012---...50 feet of crap...
然后才是我012---...then me.
把你的感觉告诉罗斯012---You gotta tell Ross how you feel.
我怎么能去对他说  那茱莉怎么办012---Oh, come on, how can I just tell him? What about Julie?
她怎样  他们才在一起两星期012---What about her? They've only been going out for two weeks.
罗斯已经爱你快十年了012---Ross has been in love with you for 10 years.
我不知道  我不知道  瑞秋012---I don't know. I don't know. Look, Rach, Rach.
我有跟一些女性友人相处过012---I've been with my share of women.
其实我有跟很多  别人的女性友人相处过012---I've been with a lot of people's share of women.
关键在于…012---But the point is...
罗斯对你的感情是我不曾感受过的012---...I've never felt about anyone the way Ross felt about you.
真的012---Really?
喂  同志012---Yo, paisan.
我可以跟你谈一下吗012---Can I talk to you for a sec?
你的裁缝师…012---Your tailor...
是一个很坏的人012---...is a very bad man!
法兰克  你在说什么啊012---Frankie? What are you talking about?
嘿   怎么了012---Hey, what's going on?
乔伊的裁缝师…012---Joey's tailor...
占我便宜012---...took advantage of me.
什么  不可能012---What? No way.
我找他好多年了012---I've been going to the guy for 12 years.
他说他要量我的内侧长度012---Oh, come on. He said he was gonna do my inseam.
然后他就沿着我的腿往上摸  然后就很明显的…012---Then he ran his hand up my leg and then there was definite...
什么012---What?
捧来捧去的012---Cupping.
他们量尺寸都是这样012---That's how they do pants!
首先  会先从一边摸上去  然后会推到另一边去012---First they go up one side, they move it over.
然后  再从另一边上来 再推回去  然后再量后面012---Then they go up the other side, move it back, then they do the rear.
干嘛  罗斯  告诉他  裁缝师不都是这样量长裤的吗012---What? Ross, tell him. Isn't that how a tailor measures pants?
对  是这样没错 那是在牢里才这样量！012---Yes, yes, it is. In prison!
你有毛病啊012---What's the matter with you?
干嘛啦012---What?
不是那样子的吗012---That's not?
哦  我的天012---Oh, my God.
即使是玛丽·泰勒·摩尔的发型  都比我好看012---Even Mary Tyler Moore would've been better.
我喜欢这发型012---I like it.
真的  我觉得这是〝十全十美〞012---Yeah, I do. I think it's a 10!
谢谢你012---Thank you.
我的头发很有趣味性012---My hair is very amused.
得了  这也不是最惨的事012---Oh, come on, things could be worse. I mean, uh...
你又没被〝卡在月亮与纽约市之间〞012---You could "get caught between the moon and New York City.
我知道〝很疯狂  不过那是真的〞012---I know it's crazy, but it's true."
真多谢012---Thank you.
嗯  我得走了  再见  待会儿见012---Well, I gotta go. Bye. See you.
再见  瑞秋  等等  你要走了012---Bye, Rach!  Wait, are you leaving?
我说〝再见〞就是这个意思012---That's what I meant by "bye."
我可以跟你谈一下下吗  好012---Well, uh, can I talk to you for a sec?  Okay.
医生做疝气检查的时候…012---When the doctor does that hernia test...
那是可以的012---That's okay.
有什么事吗  嗯…012---What's going on? Um...
嗯  好  首先…012---Well, um, okay, first of all... Mm-hm.
巴洛和我并没有复合012---...Paolo and I are not back together.
那只是我干的一件傻事012---That was a stupid thing I did.
如果我能回到过去  再有机会选择的话…012---If I could go back in time and do it again...
嗯  我就不会做傻事012---...well, I wouldn't.
其次呢012---Second of all...
干嘛012---What?
好吧012---OK.
我说之前先问你一下012---Before I say anything I just need to know...
是否就像是  你跟一个人分手…012---...is this one of those things where you break up with a guy.
然后我对你说出我的看法  然后你隔日就又跟他复合012---Then I tell you what I think... ...and the next day you get back together with him...
然后我就变成一个大傻瓜  不是012---...and I look like a complete idiot?  No, no, no.
好吧012---Okay.
好  那么  我觉得那家伙是个大浑球012---Um, well, then, I think the guy's scum.
我讨厌他  我真的… 真的很恨他012---I hate him. I mean, I actually... I physically hate him.
我一直是这种感觉012---You know? I always have.
你太棒了  他配不上你012---And you are way too good to be with a guy like that.

〝哦  我的天 我跟瑞秋在一起〞012---"Oh, my God. I'm with Rachel!" Heh.
知道吗  就是一个能让你感觉很棒的人012---You know? Someone who makes you feel good.

嘿  小班012---Hey, Ben.
穿就对了012---"Just do it"! Unh!

这是全天下最自然最美好的事物012---This is the most natural, beautiful thing in the world.
我们知道  但有个婴儿在吸吮它012---Yeah, we know. But there's a baby sucking on it.
我儿子在吃午餐  这会常常发生  最好赶快习惯012---This is my son having lunch, okay? It'll happen a lot, so get used to it.

一开始会  不过再也不会了012---It did at first, but not anymore.
钱德012---Chandler?

你要跟茱莉去布鲁明戴尔012---You're going to Bloomingdale's with Julie.
这就像到瑞秋家中偷汉子012---It's like cheating on Rachel in her house of worship.
但是我…  摩妮卡  她会宰了你012---But I... Monica, she will kill you.
她会宰了你  像宰流浪狗一样012---She will kill you like a dog in the street!
茱莉跟我说你们明天要一起去购物012---So, uh, Jules tells me you guys are going shopping tomorrow.
其实没什么大不了的  其实…012---Yeah, um, it's actually not that big a deal. In fact...

别这么惊讶  我是个和善的人012---Don't look so surprised. I'm a lovely person.

班  吃晚餐了012---Ben, dinner!
谢了  菲比阿姨012---Thanks, Aunt Pheebs.
你不是用微波的吧  母奶不可以用微波的012---You didn't microwave that, did you? It's breast milk, you're not supposed to.
我知道怎么加热母奶012---Duh, I think I know how to heat breast milk. Heh.
好012---Okay.
你刚刚做了什么012---What did you just do?
我舔了手臂啊  干嘛012---I licked my arm, what?
是母奶耶012---It's breast milk!
那又怎样012---So?
菲比  那是人身上挤出来的奶012---Phoebe, that is juice squeezed from a person.
那又怎样   不…012---What is the big deal? No, no...
你做了什么好事012---What did you just do?
你们可以不要再喝母奶了吗012---Can people stop drinking the breast milk?
你连尝尝看都不肯  不要012---You won't even taste it? - No.
连假装它是牛奶都不行吗012---Not even if you just pretend it's milk?
就算卡萝的乳房贴了寻人启事都不行012---Not even if Carol's breast had a picture of a missing child on it.
嘿   嗨012---Hey. Hi.
大家都去哪了  带小班去公园玩012---Where is everybody?  Took Ben to the park.

摩妮卡012---Mon? Mm-hmm?
如果你是一个人吃午餐  怎么会花了五十三块012---If, uh, you were at lunch alone, how come it cost you $53?
你知道发生什么事吗012---You know what probably happened?
大概有人偷了我的信用卡012---Someone must have stolen my credit card. Ah.
然后把帐单放回你的口袋012---And put the receipt back in your pocket?
这是个很棒的问题  很棒012---Huh. That is an excellent, excellent question.
太棒了012---That is excellent.
你怎么了  你跟谁一起吃午餐012---What's with you? Who did you have lunch with?
茱蒂  谁012---Judy. Who?
茱莉 乔蒂   什么012---Julie. Jody? What?
你跟茱莉出去  听着012---You were with Julie? Mm. Look.
一开始  我只是想对她好一点…012---When it started, I was just trying to be nice to her...
因为她是我哥的女朋友012---...because she was my brother's girlfriend.
然后事情接着发生…012---And then one thing led to another...
在我搞清楚之前… 我们就…012---...and before I knew it, we were...
一起购物了012---...shopping. Aah.
天啊012---Oh, my God.
等等  我们只做了一次012---Wait, we only did it once.
对我一点意义也没有012---It didn't mean anything to me.
是啊  是真的012---Yeah, right. Sure. Really!
瑞秋  我心里想的都是你012---Rachel, I was thinking of you the whole time.
听着  我真的很抱歉  好吗  我从来都不想让你发现012---Look, I'm sorry, all right? I never meant for you to find out.
拜托  你很想被逮到012---Oh, please! Please! You wanted to get caught!
乱讲012---That is not true!
所以你是不小心把收据留在这里012---So you just happened to leave it in here?
你有没有想过我或许就是那么笨012---Did it ever occur to you that I might just be that stupid?
好  摩妮卡  我需要知道一件事012---Okay, Monica, I just have to know one thing.
你有跟她一起去布鲁明戴尔吗012---Did you go with her to Bloomingdale's?
好…012---Okay. Okay.
好  我只是  我现在无法跟你在一起012---Okay, I just really, um... I just need to not be with you right now.
喂  哪一位012---Hi, who's this?

我知道我做了很糟糕的事012---Yes, I know I did a horrible thing.
乔安  事情不是那么简单012---Joanne, it's not as simple as all that, okay?
不  我不在乎史提夫怎么想的  嗨  史提夫012---No, I don't care what Steve thinks. Hi, Steve.
嘿   嗨！012---Hey! Hi!
做得怎样啊012---How did we do?
我尝了小班的母奶  罗斯吓坏了012---Oh, I tasted Ben's milk and Ross freaked out.
我没有吓坏012---I... I did not freak out.
为什么你会吓坏   因为那是母奶012---Why'd you freak out?  Because it's breast milk.
超恶心的012---It's gross!
我的母奶很恶心012---My breast milk is gross?
有趣了012---This should be fun.
不是  卡萝  你的母奶没有问题012---No, Carol. There's nothing wrong with it.
我只是觉得母奶不是成人喝的012---I just don't think breast milk is for adults.
当然  母奶的包装大人小孩都喜欢012---Of course, the packaging does appeal to grownups and kids.
罗斯  别傻了  我试过了  这没什么012---Ross, you're being silly. I've tried it. It's no big deal.
来嘛  尝一点012---Come on, just taste it.Ha-ha-ha.
我不要012---That would be no.
别这样  试试看012---Come on. Try it.
是天然的  味道不错啊012---It's natural.  It doesn't taste bad.
喝起来甜甜的 有点像…012---Yeah, it tastes kind of sweet. Sort of like, uh...
像什么   哈蜜瓜汁012---Like what?  Cantaloupe juice.
没错012---Exactly.
你有喝过012---You've tasted it.
你有喝过012---You've tasted it.
噢  你有喝过012---Oh, you've tasted it.
你可以一直说  但这句话也不会变成假的012---You can keep saying it, but it won't stop being true.
瓶子给我012---Give me the bottle.
毛巾给我012---Get me the towel.
你好啊012---Howdy.
给我一瓶果汁012---Give me a box ofjuice.
他们把我换到原野奇侠012---Well, they switched me over to Hombre.
或许是因为你的打扮012---Maybe it's because of the way you're dressed.
又或许是因为这家伙很厉害  他们要增加人手012---Or maybe this guy's doing so good they want to put more people on it.
你该看看这家伙  他现在一天可以用掉两瓶012---This guy goes through two bottles a day now.
你在乎什么012---What do you care?
你是演员  这只是你的副业  没什么大不了012---You're an actor. This is your day job. Isn't supposed to mean anything.
我知道  但我以前是最棒的012---I know, but I was the best.
我喜欢当最厉害的那个人012---You know? I liked being the best.
不知道  或许我该退出了012---Maybe I should get out of the game.
厨具部门需要有人切乳酪012---They need guys up in housewares to serve cheese.
假如你这么做了012---Say you do that.
迟早有人乳酪会切得比你好012---Sooner or later, somebody will come along that slices a better cheddar.
到时候你要逃到哪里去012---And then where you gonna run?
你说得没错  我当然是对的012---I guess you're right.  Damn right I'm right.
你让这家伙看看你的能耐  捍卫你的领土012---Show this guy what you're made of. Stand your ground.
让他知道你是内衣部西边最厉害的原野奇侠012---Show him that you're the baddest Hombre west of the lingerie!
我这就去  好！012---I'm gonna do it!  All right!
现在去找猫咪小姐  她会介绍个好妓女给你012---Now, go see Miss Kitty and she'll fix you up with a nice hooker.
我不知道还能说什么012---MONICA: I don't know what to say.
很好  因为我根本没在听012---That works good because I'm not listening.
我觉得糟透了  真的012---I feel terrible. I really do.
噢  抱歉  我的背伤到你的刀吗012---Oh, I'm sorry. Did my back hurt your knife?
瑞秋012---Rachel!
我跟她交朋友  一起去逛街012---Say that I'm friends with her. We spend time together.
有那么糟吗   对012---Is that so terrible?  Yes.
有那么糟   是的 摩妮卡 你根本不懂012---It's that terrible?  Yes, Monica! You don't get it.
她偷走我的男人已经够糟了012---It's bad enough she stole the guy...
一个我可能会长相厮守的男人012---...who may be the person I'm supposed to be with.
但是现在…012---But now...
她竟然…012---...she's actually...
她竟然连你也抢走了！012---But now she's actually stealing you!
我012---Me?
你在说什么012---What are you talking about?
没人能把我从你那里抢走012---Nobody could steal me from you.
我跟她交朋友不会影响你跟我的感情012---Because I'm friends with her doesn't make me any less friends with you.
亲爱的012---Honey.
你是我…012---I mean, you're my...
我们…012---And we're...
噢  我爱你  我也爱你！012---Oh, I love you!  I love you too!
两位  我知道这跟我一点关系都没有012---You guys, um, I know that this really doesn't have anything to do with me.
但我也好爱你们012---But, um, I love you guys too!
我真的很需要纸巾012---Ugh, I really needed that.
我知道你现在的情况…012---Look, I know you're in a place right now...
让你很讨厌茱莉012---...where you really need to hate Julie's guts.
但是她并没有做错任何事012---But she didn't do anything wrong.
她只是认识了一个男生  现在他们在交往012---She's just a girl who met a guy, and now they go out.
如果你给她点机会  你也会喜欢她的012---I think that if you gave her a chance, you'd like her.
你愿意给她一个机会吗012---Will you give that a chance?
就为了我012---For me?
我愿意为你做任何事  你知道的012---I'd do anything for you, you know that.

我准备好了012---Yeah, I'm ready.
你这白痴  白痴牛仔012---You idiot! You stupid cowboy!
你害我看不到了  我要告你012---You've blinded me! I'm suing!
天啊  陶德  你干了什么好事012---Oh, my God! Todd! What the hell did you do?
对不起  我真是笨手笨脚012---I'm sorry. I'm such a doofus!
我真的很抱歉012---I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.
天啊  发生什么事了012---My God, what happened?
这些菜鸟都待不久012---Eh, these new kids, they never last.
他们迟早都会…012---Sooner or later they all...
不再久留012---...stop lasting.
不如我现在就请你喝杯咖啡如何012---Listen, uh, what do you say I buy you that cup of coffee now?
好啊012---Sure.
那么… 那么…012---So.  So.
我想说我们两个人应该多多亲近012---I just thought the two of us should hang out a bit.
你知道  我们没有真的好好谈过012---I mean, you know, we've never really talked.
我想你也知道 毕竟你也是当事人之一012---I guess you'd know that, being one of the two of us. Ha, ha, right?
我知道012---I know.  Mm.
我大概不该跟你讲这个…012---I probably shouldn't even tell you this...
但是我还蛮怕你的012---...but I'm pretty much totally intimidated by you.
真的吗  怕我012---Really? Me?
天啊  开什么玩笑012---Oh, my God, are you kidding?
罗斯超迷恋你的…012---Ross is so crazy about you...
我真的很希望你能喜欢我  我又…012---...and I really wanted you to like me, and I...
大概只是我自己乱想吧…012---It's probably me just being totally paranoid...
我觉得你好像不想喜欢我012---...but I kind of got the feeling that maybe you don't.
嗯…012---Well...
你并不是在乱想012---...you're not totally paranoid.
好012---Okay. Um...
天啊012---God. Um... - Heh.
你跟罗斯一开始交往的时候…012---When you and, uh, Ross first started going out...
我真的很难过012---...it was really hard for me, um...
有很多原因  细节就不多说了012---...for many reasons of which I'm not gonna bore you with now, but, um...
我看到他很快乐  你们两个人很相配012---I see how happy he is and how good you guys are together.
而且摩妮卡老是说你人很好…012---And, um, Monica's always saying how nice you are...
我真讨厌她是对的012---...and God, I hate it when she's right.
谢谢  嗯012---Thanks.  Yeah.
嘿  你会想要偶尔一起去看点电影吗012---Listen. Would you like to go to a movie sometime or something?
好啊  那会很棒   是吗012---Yeah, that'd be great. I'd love it.  Yeah?
我也会喜欢   好012---I'd love it too. Okay. Okay.
噢  我该走了  好012---Oh, shoot, I gotta go.  Okay.
晚点再聊了  好  茱莉012---So I'll talk to you later.  All right, Julie.
拜  拜012---Bye.  Bye.
真是个会玩弄人的贱人012---What a manipulative bitch.
还不赖嘛012---It's not bad.
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
琼还好吗   跟她分手了012---So how was Joan? Broke up with her.
哦  为什么012---Oh, why?
别说  是鼻孔太大的问题吗012---Don't tell me. Because of the big nostril thing?
真的很大012---They were huge.
她打喷嚏的时候  会有蝙蝠飞出来012---When she sneezed, bats flew out of them.
得了吧  没那么大啦012---Come on, they were not that huge.
我告诉你  她一躺下我就能看穿她的大脑012---I'm telling you, she leaned back, I could see her brain.
你还要拒绝多少好女人012---How many women will you reject...
只为了外表或不重要的小事…012---...over the most superficial, insignificant things?
等等  这次我要站在钱德这一边012---Hold it. Hold it. I gotta side with Chandler on this one.
我刚搬到这里的时候  有跟一个女孩约会012---When I first moved to the city, I went out with this girl.
真的很辣  很会接吻012---Really hot. Great kisser...
可是她的喉结超大的012---...but she had the biggest Adam's apple.
快把我逼疯了012---Drove me nuts.
你来还是我来   我来好了012---You or me?  I got it.
乔伊  女人是没有喉结的012---Joey, women don't have Adam's apples.
你们又在恶整我了  对吧012---Heh, heh. You guys are messing with me, right?
对  正是012---Yeah. We are.
这次很厉害  刚才我还在想〝哦〞012---That's a good one. For a second there, I was like, whoa!
《老友记》  第二季  第3集  黑考斯死掉了012---Friends S02E03: The One Where Mr. Heckles Dies
你举出一个有实际的理由才分手的女人012---So you name one woman that you broke up with for an actual real reason.
玛琳·摩丝拉012---Maureen Rasillo.
她不讨厌雅尼  不能算是实际的理由012---Because she doesn't hate Yanni is not a real reason.
哈罗  黑考斯先生012---Hello, Mr. Heckles.
你们又来了012---You're doing it again.
我们没做什么啊012---We're not doing anything.
你们在跺脚  吵到我的鸟了012---You're stomping. It's disturbing my birds.
你又没有养鸟012---You don't have birds.
我原来可养鸟的012---I could have birds.
我们会尽量小声啦   谢谢012---Okay, we'll try to keep it down. Thank you.
我要回去享受我的晚宴了012---I'm going to rejoin my dinner party.
好吧  拜拜012---All right, bye-bye.
好  珍妮丝 就说珍妮丝好了 那可不叫挑剔了012---Okay, Janice. You gotta give me Janice. That wasn't about being picky.
珍妮丝为例还可以012---We'll give you Janice.
虽然说我会想念珍妮丝012---I miss Janice, though.
哈罗  钱德宾012---Hello, Chandler Bing!
哦  我的天  哦  钱德012---Oh, my God! Oh, Chandler!
快  快012---Now! Now!
就是这样012---That's it.
对  快点012---There! Faster!
放下你的扫把  我们又没有制造噪音012---Ugh. Stop with the broom! We're not making noise!
我们赢了012---We won.
我们成功了012---We won! Whoo!  Whoo!
黑考斯先生012---Mr. Heckles.
怎么发生的  当时他一定是在扫地012---How did this happen?  He was sweeping.
他们发现他还拿着扫把012---They found a broom in his hand.
太可怕了  我知道012---Oh.Oh, dear God. That's terrible. I know.
昨天我也有扫地012---I was sweeping yesterday.
也有可能是我012---It could've been me. Yeah.
扫地  真是没想到012---Sure. Sweeping. You never know.
真是天晓得012---Never know.
好  很微弱  不过我还是可以感觉到他还在这栋建筑物里012---Okay, it's very faint, but I can still sense him in the building.
快走到光里面  黑考斯先生012---Go into the light, Mr. Heckles!
好了  菲比012---Okay, Phoebe.
很抱歉  不过有时候他们是需要协助的012---I'm sorry, but sometimes they need help.
对  又来了012---Yeah. Here we go.
没关系  你们尽管嘲笑我012---That's fine, go ahead and scoff.
有很多东西我并不相信...012---There are a lot of things I don't believe in...
也不代表那些东西就不存在012---...but that doesn't mean they're not true.
比如012---Such as?
比如玉米田的圆圈圈  或百慕达三角  或进化论012---Like crop circles or the Bermuda Triangle or evolution.
哇  哇  哇012---Whoa, whoa, whoa.
哈  你不相信进化论012---What, you don't believe in evolution?
不是很信012---No. Not really.
你不相信进化论012---You don't believe in evolution?
我不知道  只是  就是…012---I don't know. It's just, you know...
猴子啦  达尔文啦  故事是不赖  我只是觉得太简单了012---Monkeys, Darwin, it's a nice story. I just think it's a little too easy.
太简单  太…012---"Too easy"? Too...
本星球上所有生物的进化过程…012---The process of every living thing on this planet evolving...
从单细胞生物开始千百万年的进化  你说〝太简单〞了012---...over millions of years from single-celled organisms is "too easy"?
对  我就是不相信这套理论012---Yeah, I just don't buy it.
抱歉  进化论  不在于你信或不信  菲比012---Excuse me. Evolution is not for you to buy, Phoebe.
进化论是科学的事实 就像我们所呼吸的空气012---Evolution is scientific fact, like the air we breathe...
就像地心引力012---...like gravity.
别惹我开始谈地心引力012---Okay, don't get me started on gravity.
你…012---You, uh...
你不相信地心引力012---You don't believe in gravity?
不在于我信或不信啦012---Well, it's not so much that, you know, I don't believe in it.
只是我近来觉得…012---Lately I get the feeling that...
我没感受到一股拉力  倒是觉得很被压抑012---...I'm not so much being pulled down as I am being pushed.
被压抑012---Pushed.
牛顿来了  而且他很火大012---Uh-oh. It's Isaac Newton and he's pissed.
她在 还有另外那个 就在那边012---There she is. And over there, that's the other one.
他是黑考斯的律师巴迪  他要跟你们谈谈012---This is Mr. Buddy Boyle, Heckles' attorney. He'd like to talk to you.
我们能帮什么忙012---What can we do for you?
好了  孩子们  情况是这样012---All right, kids, here's the deal.
根据我客户的遗嘱012---According my client's will...
他想把他所有的资产留给…012---...he wants to leave all his earthly possessions...
〝住在我公寓上方那些吵死人的女孩子们〞012---...to "the noisy girls in the apartment above mine."
他的家人呢012---What about his family?
他没有家人012---He didn't have any. Whoa.
好  那我们就来谈钱的问题012---Okay, so let's talk money.
可以  钱是没有012---All right, there was none.
现在  谈签字的事了012---Now, let's talk signing.
你是第一号吵死人女孩  你是第二号吵死人女孩012---You be noisy girl number one. You be noisy girl number two.
很难相信  我们一直以为他很讨厌我们012---I can't believe that this whole time we thought he hated us.
真是令人诧异  能如此触及别人的生命…012---Isn't it amazing how much you can touch someone's life...
却浑然不觉012---...without even knowing it?
你们看看这堆垃圾012---Would you look at this dump?
他真的很恨我们  这是他最后的复仇012---He hated us! This was his final revenge!
我从没见过这么多垃圾012---Ever seen so much crap!
我想事实上  这间公寓污辱了垃圾的美名012---Actually, I think this apartment sullies the good name of crap.
你们看看012---Check this out.
这个可以给我吗012---Can I have this?
你怎么可能不相信进化论012---How can you not believe in evolution?
我不知道  就是不信  你们看看这件怪衬衫012---I don't know, just don't. Look at this funky shirt!
菲比  我整个成年生涯都在研究进化论012---Pheebs, I've studied evolution my entire adult life.
我们从全球各地搜集许多化石012---And I can tell you, we've collected fossils from all over the world...
这些化石真的可以显现不同物种的进化012---...that actually show the evolution of different species.
我是说  你真的可以看到012---I mean, you can literally see them...
这些物种长时间的进化012---...evolving through time.
真的  真的看得到012---Really? You can actually see it?
那是一定的  美国 中国 非洲 全世界都有012---You bet! In the U.S., China, Africa, all over!
这样啊  我不晓得012---See, I didn't know that.
嗯  你长知识了012---Well, there you go.
呵012---Huh.
真正的关键在于是谁把化石放在那里的  又为了什么012---So now the real question is, who put those fossils there and why?
看看这东西 〝我的牢骚语录〞012---Hey. Look at this. My Big Book of Grievances.
嘿  有我012---Hey, there's me.
〝4月17日  巨大的噪音…012---"April 17th, excessive noise...
意大利佬带约会对象回家〞012---...ltalian guy comes home with a date." Yeah.
钱德你看  也有你012---Chandler, you're in here too.
〝4月18日  巨大噪音…012---"April 18th, excessive noise...
意大利佬的同志室友带干洗衣物回家〞012---...ltalian guy's gay roommate brings home dry cleaning."
嗯  记录得很好012---Well, that's excellent.
摩妮卡  看看这盏灯012---Monica, look at this lamp.
这算俗气或什么  这个我们一定要012---Is this tacky or what? We have to have this.
我想我们一般的灯已经够多了012---I think we have enough regular lamps.
什么  得了 我又不是…012---What? Come on, it's not like...
想要这种娃娃型的钟  或什么的012---...I'm asking for this girlie clock or anything.
对了  我觉得这个也很酷012---Which, by the way, I also think is really cool.
喂  这跟我的东西不搭啦012---Look, it doesn't go with any of my stuff.
嗯  那我的东西呢012---Well, what about my stuff?
你又没有任何东西012---You don't have any stuff.
你还是认为那是你的公寓对吧012---You still think of it as your apartment, don't you?
不是  是  你是的012---Mmm... No. Yes, you do.
你认为那是你的公寓  我只是租一间房间而已012---You think of it as your apartment and I just rent a room.
唔012---Mmm...
你继续〝嗯〞好了  我要去找个地方放我的新台灯012---Okay, while you "mmm" on that, I'll go find a place for my new lamp.
好  菲比  看到我怎么动这些小玩具的吗012---Okay, Pheebs. See how I'm making these little toys move?
拇指相对论012---Opposable thumbs!
若非进化论  你如何解释拇指相对论012---Without evolution, how do you explain opposable thumbs?
也许是那些太空舰长为了操纵太空舰才衍生的012---Maybe the Overlords needed them to steer their spacecrafts.
跟我说你只是在开玩笑012---Tell me you're joking.
喂  这样说好了  你相信某事但我不信012---Look, can't we just say that you believe in something and I don't?
不  菲比  不可以   有何不可012---No. No, Pheebs, we can't. Why not?
干嘛非要别人认同你的看法呢012---What is this obsessive need you have to make everybody agree with you?
到底是为什么 你知道我所想012---No, what's that all about? You know what I think?
也许是你把〝罗斯〞放在显微镜下的时候了012---I think maybe it's time you put Ross under the microscope.
有血从我耳里喷出来吗012---Is there blood coming out of my ears?
你们看  黑考斯的中学纪念册012---Check it out. Heckles' high-school yearbook.
哇  他看起来很正常耶012---Wow. He looks so normal.
他甚至有点可爱012---He's even kind of cute.
〝黑考斯  连自然课你都能让我开怀大笑012---"Heckles, you crack me up in science class.
你是全校最好玩的小孩〞012---You're the funniest kid in school."
最好玩  黑考斯   上面是这样说的012---Funniest? Heckles?  That's what it says.
黑考斯曾当选班上的小丑  我也是012---Wow. Heckles was voted class clown, and so was I.
他是对的  你们听听看012---He was right. Would you listen to that?
我也会称之为巨大的噪音012---I'd call that excessive.
什么012---Whoa. What?
黑考斯在乐团吹竖笛  我也吹竖笛012---Heckles played clarinet in band, and I played clarinet.
他是模型社团的会员  我也是…012---And he was in the scale modeler's club and I was...
我们是没有社团  不过我真的觉得他们很酷012---Well, there was no club, but I sure thought they were cool.
那又怎样  你们两个都是书呆子012---So? You were both dorks.
有啥大不了的012---Big deal.
我只是觉得很诡异  知道吗  黑考斯跟我…012---I just think it's weird, you know? Heckles and me...
黑考斯跟我  我…012---Heckles and me. Me...
我跟黑考斯012---Me and Heckles.
嘿  你们别吵了012---Hey, would you knock it off!
啊012---Ah!
你整晚都在这里吗012---Have you been here all night?
看看这个012---Look at this.
所有跟黑考斯交往过的女人012---Pictures of all the women Heckles went out with.
看看他写的评语 〝薇薇安  太高〞012---Look what he wrote on them. "Vivian, too tall."
〝玛斯  牙龈太露〞012---"Madge, big gums."
〝太吵〞012---"Too loud."
〝太聪明〞 〝吃东西时太大声〞012---"Too smart." "Makes noise when she eats."
这就是我012---This is me.
这就是我的作法012---This is what I do.
我会一人孤独的死去  就像他这样012---I'm gonna end up alone, just like he did.
钱德  黑考斯是个神经病012---Chandler, Heckles was a nut case.
我们的火车走在相同的轨道上012---Our trains are on the same track.
我是落后他30年  可是终点站完全一样012---I'm coming up 30 years behind him, but the stops are all the same.
苦涩的小镇…012---Bitter Town...
孤单的小城  隐者小站012---...Alone-ville, Hermit Junction!
知道我们该怎么做吗  带你离开这里012---You know what we gotta do? Get you out of here.
来吧  我请你吃早餐012---Come on, I'll buy you breakfast.
万一我永远找不到对象呢  或更惨 万一我找到了…012---What if I never find somebody? Or worse, what if I found her...
就因为她的口头禅是〝有可能〞就甩掉她了呢012---...but I dumped her because she pronounces it "supposably"?
钱德  得了吧  你会找到对象的012---Chandler, come on, you're gonna find somebody.
你哪会知道呢  哪会012---How do you know that? How?
我是不知道  我只是想拉你一把012---I don't know. I'm just trying to help you out.
你们都会结婚012---You guys will all get married...
而我会孤寂而终012---...and I'll end up alone.
你能答应我一件事吗012---Will you promise me something?
等你结婚后  你可以都邀我过去过节吗012---When you're married, will you invite me over for holidays?
我不晓得到时候  我们会想做什么012---I don't know what we'll be doing.
我是指  万一我们得去她爸妈家过节呢012---I mean, what if we're over at her folks' place?
对  我了解012---Yeah, I understand.
你倒是可以过来看超级杯012---You can come over and watch the Super Bowl.

你们为何如此难以理解012---Why is that difficult to comprehend?
你还记得珍妮丝吧012---You remember Janice, right?
对  她很聪明  很漂亮  而且她真的很在乎我012---Yes. She was smart, she was pretty and she honestly cared about me.

然后呢  错失你惊讶的表情   哦  不行012---And what? Miss the expression on your face? Oh, no.
珍妮丝也想开心一下012---Janice likes to have her fun.
瑞秋  知道我们有一阵子没玩什么游戏了吗012---You know what we haven't played in a while?
什么  〝把灯藏起来〞012---What?  Hide the lamp.
摩妮卡  少来了012---Monica, let it go.

那你只好去吃别的台灯012---Then you'll just have to eat the other lamps.
是那个可怕的科学人012---Uh-oh. It's scary scientist man.
好  菲比  时候到了012---Okay, Phoebe, this is it.
在这皮箱中 我带来真正的科学事实012---In this briefcase I carry actual scientific facts.
请注意  是有一整箱的事实012---A briefcase of facts, if you will.
这里有些化石 都是超过两亿年之久的012---Some of these fossils are over 200 million years old.
在你开始前  我先声明  我不是在否认进化论012---Okay, look, before you even start, I'm not denying evolution.
我是说那只是一种可能性012---It's just one of the possibilities.
菲比  是唯一的可能性012---It's the only possibility.
罗斯  请放开你的思想  就一点点行吗012---Ross, could you just open your mind, like, this much? Okay?
过去也有最聪明的人  相信地球是扁的  不是吗012---Wasn't there a time when the brightest minds in the world believe the Earth was flat?
50年之前  你们还认为原子是最小的东西…012---And up till 50 years ago, you all thought the atom was the smallest thing...
直到你们打开了原子  才跑出一大堆鬼东西012---...until you split it open and this whole mess of crap came out.
你现在却告诉我  你是如此难以置信的自大012---Now, are you telling me that you are so unbelievably arrogant...
你完全不肯承认此事  的确有一点点  一丝丝012---...that you can't admit that there's a teeny, tiny possibility...
错误的可能性012---...that you could be wrong about this?
是有那么…012---There might be...
一点点…012---...a teeny...
一丝丝的…012---...tiny...
可能性012---...possibility.
真不敢相信你屈服了012---I can't believe you caved.
什么   你刚抛弃你整个信仰系统012---What? You just abandoned your whole belief system!
之前  我虽然不认同你  最起码我还敬重你012---Before, I didn't agree with you, but at least I respected you.
可是…012---But...
你明天要如何去上班012---How are you gonna go into work tomorrow?
你将如何面对其他的科学人012---How are you going to face the other science guys?
你将如何面对你自己012---How are you going to face yourself? Oh...
真好玩  有谁饿了  我012---That was fun. So who's hungry? I am.
我也是  我去拿我的外套012---Me too. Let me just get my coat.
出什么事了   好吧   没事012---What happened? Okay. All right.
是意外  我发誓012---It was an accident, I swear.
我在穿外套然后那东东  那台灯  就破了012---I was putting on my jacket and the thing and the lamp and it broke.
哦  拜托  摩妮卡  你一向讨厌我的灯012---Oh, please, Monica! You've always hated my lamp!
如今  突然的神来一笔  它就破了012---And now all of a sudden, it's just magically, it's just broken?
菲比  你告诉她012---Phoebe, tell her?
好  我没看到  当时我也在穿外套012---I didn't see it, because I was putting on my jacket.
不过  我想相信你012---But I want to believe you.
钱德  摩妮卡刚刚打破我的贝壳灯012---Hey, Chandler. Monica just broke my seashell lamp.
了不起012---Neat.
我会孤寂而终012---I'm gonna die alone!
好  算你赢012---Okay, you win.
钱德  你不会孤寂而终的啦012---Chandler, you are not gonna die alone.
珍妮丝本来是我的救生网  好吗012---Janice was my safety net, okay?
现在我只好去找一条蛇了012---And now I have to get a snake.
这又是为了什么012---Uh-huh. Why is that?
如果我势必会成为孤伶伶的老头子  我就需要有个东西012---If I'm gonna be an old, lonely man, I'm gonna need a thing.
像是依靠012---You know, a hook.
就像在地下铁吃自己脸的那个家伙012---Like that guy on the subway who eats his own face.
所以我想要成为〝带着蛇的疯子〞012---So I figure I'll be "Crazy Man With A Snake."
疯狂的蛇人012---Crazy Snake Man.
然后我会弄更多的蛇  叫他们我的宝贝012---Then I'll get more snakes, call them my babies.
小鬼经过我住的地方都会用跑的012---Kids won't walk past my place, they will run!
他们会边跑边叫〝逃离疯狂的蛇人〞012---"Run away from Crazy Snake Man," they'll shout!
你得走出来才行012---You've got to get over this. Okay?
你不会孤寂而终的012---You won't end up alone.
我当然会012---Of course I am.
我拒绝每一个疯狂到真的跟我交往的对象012---I reject anyone who's crazy enough to actually go out with me...
然后我才来抱怨  这世上根本没有好女人012---...and then I bitch that there aren't any great women out there.
钱德012---Chandler
你刚刚的形容012---You have just described...
其实就跟我们交往过的每一个男人一样012---...virtually every man that we've ever gone out with.
耶012---Yeah.
你不是怪物  你是一个正常男人012---You are not a freak. You're a guy.
她是对的  你们全都一样012---She's right. You're no different than the rest.
等等  等等  不  他不一样012---Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Yes, he is.
你完全不同   负面的不同012---You are totally different. In a bad way?
不  亲爱的  是正面的012---No, honey, in a wonderful way.
现在你知道自己要什么了012---You know what you want now.
大部分的人根本浑然不觉012---Most guys don't even have a clue.
你已经愿意冒险  愿意跟某人拥有亲密又不设防的关系012---You're ready to take risks, be vulnerable and intimate with someone.
你不会孤寂而终的012---You're not gonna end up alone.
钱德  你打给珍妮丝就代表你很想跟某人在一起！012---You called Janice. That's how much you wanted to be with someone!
你成功了  你办到了012---You've made it.  You're there.
你已经可以许下承诺了012---You are ready to make a commitment!
这我还不能确定012---Whoa! Don't know about that.
你拿的是什么东西012---Wow. What you got there?
又是个不是你的  但可以被你打破的东西012---Something else that's not yours that you can break?
不是012---No.
我知道你喜欢这个  我要你收下012---I know you like this and I want you to have it.
这东西放在我们公寓里会很搭012---It'll look good in our apartment.
谢谢你012---Thank you.
没问题012---That's fine.
嘿   嘿012---Hey. Hey.
知道了你们一定会很开心  明晚我有个约会012---You'll all be pleased to know that I have a date tomorrow night.
这个女的叫艾莉森  是同事  她很棒012---This woman Allison from work. She is great.
她很漂亮  很聪明  过去呢…012---She's pretty, she's smart. And I've been...
我一直没邀她出来  是因为她有个…012---...holding off asking her out in the past, because she has a...
不寻常的大头012---...unusually large head.
不过  我不想再让这种事情耽误了012---But I'm not going to let that stuff hang me up anymore. All right.
看看我  我长大了012---Look at me. I'm growing.
纪念册是不能回收的吧012---Hey, you can't recycle yearbooks, can you?
这个给我012---I'll take that.
你要他的纪念册    对啊012---You want his yearbook?  Yeah. Yeah.
有些人提到他的好  有人应该要收着这本的012---Some people said nice things about him. Somebody should have it.
天哪  这真的很诡异012---Gosh, this is so weird.
他的一生都在这间公寓里  现在一切都消失了012---His whole life was in this apartment and now it's gone.
我们如果能纪念黑考斯几分钟  一定很好012---I think it would be nice if we just took a few moments for Mr. Heckles.
他是有点烦人 是的 不过他 也是一个人012---I mean, he was kind of a pain. He was, but he was a person.
什么012---What?
你们全都下地狱去012---You're all going to hell.
其实没那么大啦012---It's really not that big.
你要带走  嗯   哦  对012---Taking that with you, huh?  Oh, yeah.
嘿  你要走了吗012---Hey, you coming?
再一下下012---Yeah, in a second.
再见了  黑考斯先生012---Goodbye, Mr. Heckles.
我们会尽量小声点012---We'll try to keep it down.
我主修的科目很没用012---ALLISON: My major was useless.
你看分类广告时  有常看到〝诚征哲学家〞吗012---How often do you look in the classifieds and see "Philosopher Wanted"?
当然012---Heh, heh. Sure.
我的天哪  好大一个头012---My God, that's a big head!
在办公室时感觉没这么大  也许是灯光的缘故012---It didn't look this big in the office. Maybe it's the lighting.
上班时  我的头看起来一定像颗高尔夫球而已012---My head must look like a golf ball at work.
别执着于此事  快点  列出五点你喜欢她的地方012---Don't get hung up on it. Quick, quick. List five things you like about her.
笑容可掬  穿着有品012---Nice smile, good dresser.
大头  大头  大头012---Big head, big head, big head!
妈  你别紧张好吗012---Mom, would you relax?
那里离这有十条街远  而且那女子是夜间落单012---That was 10 blocks from here, and the woman was walking alone at night.
我才不会那样012---I would never do that.
妈  拜托  你别担心了012---Mom, come on, stop worrying.
这条街很安全  这栋大楼很安全  没什么…012---This is a safe street. This is a safe building. There's nothing...
喔  天啊  你怎么飞进来的012---Aah! Oh, my God! What are you doing in here?
妈  我得挂电话了012---Mom, I gotta go. I gotta go.
天啊012---Oh, my God.
好012---Okay.
没问题  你尽管看报纸012---That's fine, you just read the paper.
我去拿个锅子012---I'm gonna get a pot.
不是给你用的012---It's not for you.
没问题  很好012---Okay, that's fine.
看看《家庭马戏团》的漫画…012---Read the Family Circus...
享受温馨的喜剧012---...enjoy the gentle comedy...
喔  天啊… 喔  天啊012---Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
哦  噢  老天  噢  老天012---Ugh. Oh, God. Oh, God.
门没关012---It's open, you guys.
嗨   嗨  有什么事吗012---Hi.  Hi. Can I help you?
我找菲比  她还住在这里吗012---I'm looking for Phoebe, does she still live here?
她不住这了  但我可以传话012---Uh, no, she doesn't. But I can get a message to her.
太棒了  就跟她说她的老公来过012---Great. Uh, just tell her her husband stopped by.
她的什么012---Her what? Aah!
嘿  你怎么办到的012---Hey, how did you do that?
《老友记》  第二季  第4集  菲比的老公012---Friends S02E04: The One With Phoebe's Husband
这太扯了  菲比  你怎么可能已经结婚了012---This is unbelievable, Pheebs. How can you be married?
我没有〝真正〞结婚012---I'm not "married" married, you know?
他是个朋友  还是个同志…012---He was just a friend, and he's gay...
他是加拿大人  需要绿卡012---...and he was from Canada, and he needed a Green Card.
我真不敢相信你嫁给邓肯012---I can't believe you married Duncan.
你怎么没告诉我   我们是无话不说的姊妹淘012---I mean, how could you not tell me? We lived together, we told each other everything.
对不起  但如果我跟你说  你就会批评012---I'm sorry, Monica, but I knew if I told you, you'd get really, like, judgmental...
也不会赞同的  我当然不会赞同012---...and would not approve. Of course I wouldn't approve.
你彻底爱上一个同志了012---You were totally in love with this guy who, hello, was gay.
你到底怎么想的012---I mean, what the hell were you thinking?
好残忍的批评啊012---See? And you thought she'd be judgmental.
我没跟他谈恋爱  我只是帮一个朋友012---Okay, I wasn't in love with him. I was just helping out a friend.
他离开后  你失魂落魄一个月012---Please. When he left town, you stayed in your pajamas for a month.
而且我看到你还吃了一个起司汉堡012---And I saw you eat a cheeseburger.
难道你没有吗012---Well, didn't you?
可能有吧012---I might have.
我真不敢相信你没告诉我012---I can't believe you didn't tell me.
难道你有对我坦白一切    我有什么隐瞒你012---Come on. Like you tell me everything? What have I not told you?
我不知道012---Ooh, I don't know. Um...
比如说电线杆上的内衣是你的012---...how about the fact that the underwear out there on the telephone pole is yours...
因为你跟巴比在阳台上做爱012---...from when you were having sex with Fun Bobby on the terrace.
什么   是谁告诉你的012---What?   Wait a minute. Who told you?
你死定了012---You are dead meat.
我不知道那是个大秘密012---I didn't know it was a big secret.
喔  没什么大不了  没关系012---Oh, it's not big. Not at all.
那有点像…012---You know, kind of on the same lines as, say
就好像… 有人有第三个奶头一样012---I don't know, having a third nipple.
你有三个奶头012---You have a third nipple?
你这个烂人012---You bitch.
我要看  我要看  对啊012---Whip it out. Whip it out. Yeah, yeah.
没什么好看的 只是很小的突出  没什么作用012---No, come on. There's nothing to see. It's just a tiny bump. It's totally useless.
难道你其他的奶头就有作用012---Oh, as opposed to your other multifunctional nipples?
我不敢相信  你跟我说那只是个肿块012---I can't believe you. You told me it was a nubbin.
乔伊  你认为肿块是什么样子012---Joey, what did you think a nubbin was?
我不知道  他那样说我就信了012---I don't know. You see something, you hear a word, I thought that's what it was.
让我再看一次   没错  我们要看012---Let me see it again. Yeah, show us your nubbin.
乔伊演过色情片012---Joey was in a porno movie.
我死的话  也要拖大家下水012---If I'm going down, I'm taking everybody with me.
我的妈呀  你演过色情片012---Oh, my God.You were in a porno?
那是年轻时候  我只想要份工作012---I was young and I just wanted a job, okay?
但最后一刻我无法做下去012---But at the last minute I couldn't go through with it.
他们后来让我演修影印机的人  但我没法修012---So they let me be the guy who comes in to fix the copier but can't...
因为有人在上面办那档事012---...because there's people having sex on it.
哇噢012---Wow.
好狂野012---That is wild.
那是什么形状  有长毛吗012---So, what's it shaped like? Is there a hair on it?
你弹它时有什么反应012---What happens if you flick it?
它有什么特殊之处012---So, uh, does it do anything, you know, special?
按下我的第三个奶头可以通往…012---Why, yes, Ross, pressing my third nipple opens the delivery entrance...
纳尼亚的神奇国度012---...to the magical land of Narnia.
有些文化认为 有三个奶头的人特别有男子气概012---You know, in some cultures, having a third nipple is actually a sign of virility.
你可以住最好的屋子  还有裸女围着你跳舞012---You get the best huts, and women dance naked around you.
那地方会不会恰巧  就在这附近的三州地带012---Huh. Are, uh, any of these cultures, per chance, in the Tri-State area?
你真厉害  你有什么不懂的事吗012---You know, you are so amazing. Is there anything you don't know?
茱莉好聪明   茱莉好特别喔012---Ooh, Julie's so smart. Julie's so special.
我跟你一样渴望你跟罗斯复合012---Look, honey, I wanted you to hook up with Ross as much as you did.
但他现在有新欢了  你得想办法克服这感觉012---But he's with her now. You're just gonna have to get over it.
喔  我得想办法克服012---Oh, I'm going to have to get over it.
我都不知道我就只能克服这感觉012---God, see, I didn't know that's what I had to do. I just have to get over it.
喔012---Whoa.
漂亮小姐  你要去哪012---Sassy lady. Where are you going?
我要去见邓肯  他今晚在花园广场溜冰012---Um, I'm gonna go meet Duncan. He's skating tonight at the Garden.
他是溜冰表演团的012---He's in the Capades.
冰上溜冰   难不成在石头上溜012---The Ice Capades? No, no, the Gravel Capades.
虽然溜不快  但史努比跌倒时  还是很好笑012---Yeah, the turns aren't as fast, but when Snoopy falls? Funny.
我不敢相信你为他盛装赴约  你这是在自讨苦吃012---I can't believe you're dressing up for him. You're setting yourself up all over again.
并不是012---Okay, no.
我告诉你  我见他是为了忘掉这段感情012---For your information, I'm going to see him so I can put all those feelings behind me.
我这样穿是因为我觉得…012---And the reason I'm dressed like this is because I think it's nice...
为同志老公打扮是很好的事012---...to look nice for your gay husband.
妈的  牛奶没了012---Darn it, we're all out of milk.
钱德  帮我加满好吗012---Hey, Chandler, will you fill me up here?
喔  我懂了  原来是因为我有第三个奶头012---Oh, I see, I see. Because of the third-nipple thing.
甜心  晚点再见了  再见012---Okay, sweetie, I'll see you later.  Bye.
瑞秋  待会儿见   拜拜 茱莉012---See you later, Rach. Bye-bye, Julie.
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
拜托  别闹了012---Hey, come on, cut it out.
嘿   什么事012---Hey. What?
我能问你一件事吗   当然可以012---Can I ask you something?  Sure.
什么啦012---Eh. What?
跟我说嘛   好吧012---Come on, talk to me. Okay.
你恋爱时  不上床最久是…012---What's the longest you've been in a relationship before...
维持多久的时间012---...having the sex?
你为何问这…  是谁… 你跟茱莉还没012---Why? Who's not...? Are you and Julie not...?
你跟茱莉还没上床吗012---Are you and Julie not having sex?
这个嘛012---Well...
技术上来说是没有012---Technically? No.
是因为她在床上很冷淡吗012---Is it because she's so cold in bed?
还是她有点颐指气使  让你觉得像小学生012---Or is it because she's kind of bossy, makes it feel like school?
不  她很好  我们不是完全没进展012---No. No. She's great. And it's not like we haven't done anything.
我们做了很多事  比如说…012---I mean, we do plenty of other stuff. Lots of other stuff like...
不  我不需要知道细节012---No, no, no. Don't need to know the details.
不  只是…012---No, it's just...
是我的问题012---It's me.
我这辈子就只跟过一个女人012---You know, I've only been with one woman my whole life...
结果她变成一个蕾丝边012---...and she turned out to be a lesbian. Uh-huh.
所以现在我很害怕012---So now I've got myself all psyched out.
这就像是…012---It's become, like, this...
一个障碍012---...this thing, and I...
你一定觉得我很怪012---You must just think I'm weird.
不  我一点都不这么觉得012---No. No, no, no. I don't think it's weird.
我认为  事实上…012---I think... I think, um, in fact...
你知道我怎么想吗  怎么想012---In fact, you know what I think? What?
我认为这很性感012---I think it's sexy.
性感012---Sexy?
我告诉你  身为女人  最性感的男人…012---Let me tell you something. As a woman... ...there is nothing sexier...
就是不想上床的男人012---...than a man who does not want to have sex.
真的  你知道我会怎么办吗012---No kidding.  Oh, yeah. In fact, you know what I'd do?
我会等待012---I'd wait.
你会等待  没错  我会等待…012---You'd wait? Yes, absolutely. I would wait...
等待…012---...and wait...
再等持012---Then I'd wait some more.
真的  没错012---Really? Oh, yeah.
不管她说她有多想要  她怎么乞求你…012---I don't care how much she tells you she wants it, I don't care if she begs... ...she pleads
甚至拿跟别的男人上床来威胁你012---She tells you she's gonna have sex with another man.
那就代表这招奏效了012---That just means it's working.
女人要的是这个012---Women really want this?
比珠宝还渴望012---More than jewelry.
嗨012---Hi.
菲比012---Phoebe.Ta-da.
嗨012---Hi.
看看你  你看起来好漂亮012---Ah, look at you. You look great.
是吗  谢谢012---Do I? Thank you.
你也是  闪闪发光   谢谢012---So do you. Sparkly. Thanks.
那么…012---So...
这真是太棒了 溜冰男主角012---Wow. This is pretty wonderful, huh, Mr. Major Capades Guy.
我还记得你以前只是个跑龙套的012---I remember when you were just like King Friday in Mr. Roger's Ice Is Nice.
你总是说我会成功的012---You always said I'd make it.
是啊  我的预感是蛮吓人的012---Yeah, well, you know, I'm kind of spooky that way. Woo.
天啊  我真想念你012---God, I missed you.
我得去换件衣服  好的012---I'm gonna get changed. Okay.
我是说现在012---Um, now.
什么   菲比012---What? Pheebs.
喔  好的012---Oh. Right. Okay.
什么012---What?
斗牛士…012---The Matador, so...
噢也  哈哈012---Olé. Ha, ha.
甜心  帮我拿着好吗  好啊012---Sweetie, can you hold this for a second? Sure.
谢了012---Thanks.
茱莉  是的012---Uh, Julie?  Yeah.
对不起  有个古生物学家在你脸上012---Sorry, you had a paleontologist on your face.
现在没了  你没事了012---But, uh, it's gone now. You're all right.
大家好   嗨012---Hi, everyone.Hi.
听着  听着  我要谢谢你之前跟我的聊天012---Oh, listen, listen... I wanted to thank you for, uh, our little talk before.
不客气  所以你会采取等待策略012---Oh, God, no problem. So you're gonna go with the waiting thing?
我本想这么做  但跟你谈过后  我跟乔伊谈过012---Well, I was going to, but after I talked to you, I talked to Joey.
很好  他怎么说012---Good. Ahem. What did he say?
基本上  他告诉我别想太多  尽管放手去做012---Basically, he told me to get over myself and just do it.
于是我想了想你说的和他说的012---So I thought about what you said and about what he said.
依他的说法  我今晚就可以跟她上床  所以…012---And, well, his way, I get to have sex tonight, so...
我口袋里的这个是什么012---What is this in my pocket?
天啊  是乔伊的色情月012---Why, it's Joey's porno movie.
放进去播吧012---Pop it in.
我无所谓  如果你看到里面的人只有两个奶头不会觉得奇怪的话012---I'm fine with it, I mean, if you're okay watching a video filled with two-nippled people.
性爱画面  那正是我需要的012---Great. People having sex. That's just what I need to see.
性爱有什么不对012---What's wrong with people having sex?
嗯…012---Well...
你知道  这种片子很恶心012---Well, um, you know, these movies are offensive...
并且丑化女人和女性012---...and, uh, degrading to women and females...
灯光也打得很差012---And, uh, the lighting's always unflattering.
还有…012---And...
摩妮卡  帮我一下   管他的  我想看乔伊012---Monica, help me out here. Hell, I wanna see Joey.
是有故事情节还是他们直接就…012---So is there, like, a story, or do they just start doing it right...
喔  当我没说012---Oh. Never mind.
等等  那是我见过  最疯狂的打字测试012---Okay, now, wait a minute. That is the craziest typing test I've ever seen.
我说她最好能得到这份工作012---All I say is, she better get the job.
依我看  他才是得到这份〝工作〞的人012---Looks to me like he's the one getting the job.
我来了…我来了012---Shh. Hey, here I come. Here I come.
我来修影印机了012---See, I'm coming to fix the copier.
我没办法走到影印机那  心里想我该怎么办012---I can't get to the copier. I'm thinking, "What do I do? What do I do?"
于是我就看他们亲热012---So I just watch them have sex.
等等  我的台词来了012---And then I say... Here's my line.
这样会弄坏送纸匣的012---You know, that's bad for the paper tray.
干得好  朋友   谢谢012---Nice work, my friend. Thank you.
等等  我又出现了 等等  那男的屁股挡着我012---Wait, you see me again. Hang on, the guy's butt's blocking me.
我出现了…出现了…012---There I am. There I am. There I am.
有什么事吗  你昨天去找我012---So, um... So, what's up? You came to see me yesterday.
喔  对012---Oh, yeah, um...
好吧012---All right.
我需要离婚012---I kind of need a divorce.
好…的012---Okay.
为什么012---How come?
事实上  我要再婚了012---Um, actually, I'm getting married again.
什么  天啊  我真不知道该怎么告诉你012---What? Oh, God, I don't know how to tell you this.
我是异性恋012---I'm straight.
我知道012---Yeah, I know.
我不懂 我不懂 你怎么会是异性恋012---I don't understand. I don't understand. How can you be straight?
你是如此聪明和风趣 又那么会办奥斯卡金奖派对012---I mean, you're so smart and funny... ...and you throw such great Academy Award parties.
我知道  我也是那样告诉自己012---I know. That's what I kept telling myself.
但有一天  你会发现再也无法活在谎言里012---But you just reach a point where you can't live a lie anymore.
你知道有多久了012---So how long have you known?
我想在某个程度上  我一直知道自己是异性恋012---I guess on some level I always knew I was straight.
我不应该是这样的012---I thought I was supposed to be something else.
我是冰上舞者  我朋友都是同志  我只是想融入他们012---You know, I'm an ice dancer, all my friends are gay. I was just trying to fit in.
那么…012---And, um...
所以你真的爱上一个女人012---And there's actually a woman?
她的名字是黛柏拉012---Her name's Debra.Oh.
她是你第一个在一起的女人012---Well, is she the first that you've been with?
我从没告诉过你…012---Well, I've never told you this...
但我大学时曾经有一  两次012---...but there were one or two times back in college...
喝得醉醺醺的跑去酒吧012---...when I'd get really drunk and go to a straight bar...
醒来发现身旁躺着女人012---...and wake up with a woman next to me.
我告诉自己那是酒精的缘故  大学还是摸索的年纪012---But I told myself it was the liquor, and everyone experiments in college.
当然012---Sure.
现在我知道自己没选择了  我生来就是如此012---But now I know I don't have a choice about this. I was born this way.
我不知道要说什么012---I don't know what to say.
你跟一个人结婚六年  以为自己很了解他012---You know, you're married to someone for six years... and you think you know him.
但有一天他突然说 〝我不是同志！〞012---And then one day he says, "Oh, I'm not gay."
我还是我啊012---I'm... I'm still me.
为何你在六年前没想清楚呢012---Why couldn't you just have figured this out six years ago?
你知道  里面闻起来还是有猴子的味道喔012---You know, it still smells like monkey in there.
那我们就不用多说了012---Well, that saves us the conversation.
今晚很棒  但我好累012---Well, this has been great, but I'm officially wiped.
我也是  我们该走了  不012---Me too. We should get going.No.
不  拜托你们012---No. I mean... No. Come on, you guys.
别这样  现在才十一点半012---Come on, look, it's only 11:30.
我们来聊天  我们好久没一起聊天了012---Let's just talk. We never just hang out and talk anymore.
瑞秋  我们总是在聊天012---Rachel, that's all we do.
我们或许经常那样  但菜莉呢012---Maybe that's all we do. What about Julie?
茱莉怎样012---What about Julie?
你出现在我们生活圈将近两个月012---Well, you have been in our lives for nearly two months now...
但我们并不真的了解你012---...and we don't really know you.
我是说  茱莉是谁  你喜欢什么  讨厌什么012---I mean, who is Julie? I mean, what do you like? What don't you like?
我们想知道一切012---We want to know everything.
那要花点时间012---Well, heh, that could take a while.
所以呢012---So?
这里有谁没时间了解茱莉012---I mean, who here does not have the time to get to know Julie?
我有时间  我有012---I got the time to get to know Julie. I got time, yeah.
瑞秋  我很了解她  我可以走吗012---Uh, Rach, ahem, I know her pretty well. Can I go?
好吧012---That's fine.
我们从你的童年谈起吧  你的童年如何012---Okay, Julie, so let's start with your childhood. What was that like?
简而言之…012---Well, in a nutshell... Ah-ah-ah.
那… 你告诉你父母了吗012---So, um, have you told your parents?
还没  但那没问题  他们不会有意见的012---No, but it'll be okay. They're pretty cool.
我哥也是异性恋  所以…012---My brother's straight, so...
好了012---Here you go.
对了  我还有个问题012---You know what? I just have one more question. Um...
如果你早点发现  而我又在你身边012---If you had figured this out sooner, and, um, I had been around...
你觉得我能不能成为…012---...do you think I would have been the one who?
不  别告诉我012---No, no. That's all right. Don't tell me.
不管是哪个答案我都不会宽慰些  拿去吧012---I don't think either answer would make me feel better. Here.
我爱你  菲比012---I love you, Phoebe.
所以你老哥是异性恋  是吗012---So your brother's straight, huh?
我是认真的012---Seriously.
我二年级的老师是汤姆斯小姐012---And my second-grade teacher was Miss Thomas...
一年级老师是柯比太太012---...and my first-grade teacher was Mrs. Cobb.
葛比太太012---Ahem. Mrs. Gobb?
不  柯比  柯比沙拉的柯比012---No, Cobb. Like cobb salad.
好012---Hmm, okay.
那… 柯比沙拉里面到底有什么012---Now, what exactly is in a cobb salad?
我要回家了012---I'm going home.
天啊  茱莉还真能讲012---Boy, that Julie's a talker, huh?
晚安012---Good night.
呼嘘012---Whew.
那么…  晚安012---So...  Good night.
时候不早了  你或许不再打算要…012---It's pretty late. You're probably, uh, not still planning on...
不  我还是想012---Oh. No, no, I am. Oh.
你会紧张吗012---Well, hey, are you nervous?
不会… 我…012---No, no. I, uh...
我有过经验的012---I have done it before.
我是说  你打算怎么做012---Well, okay, I mean, how are you gonna handle it?
你会先跟她谈一谈  或者就直接扑上去012---Are you gonna talk about it beforehand? Are you just gonna pounce?
我不知道  我想我就…012---I, uh... I don't know. I guess I'm just gonna...
看着办吧012---...see what happens.
好吧  祝你好运012---Okay. Good luck.
怎…012---What...? Uh...
怎么了   没什么012---What?  Nothing. I mean, um...
这是你跟她的第一次  第一次不顺利的话012---It is your first time with her, and, you know, if the first time doesn't go well...
日后要表现好就很难了012---...well then, that's pretty darn hard to recover from.
你这么说我倒紧张了012---Okay, now I'm nervous.
或许你应该缓一缓012---Maybe you should put it off.
不  我不想再延后了012---No, I don't want to put it off.
去年我悲惨到不行012---God, I'm just... I spent last year being so unbelievably miserable.
现在我真的很快乐012---And now I'm actually happy.
我是指真正的快乐012---You know, I mean, really happy.
我只是不想…012---I just don't wanna...
我不想搞砸  你懂吗012---I don't wanna mess it up, you know?
我懂012---I know.
对012---Yeah.
对不起   不是你的错012---I'm sorry. No, it's not your fault.
是啊012---Right.
也许不用搞得这么难012---Maybe it doesn't have to be this tough.
或许你说的〝看着办〞 是最好的做法012---Maybe you were on the right track with that whole, you know, spontaneous thing.
女人喜欢那样   真的012---I mean, women really like that. Really?
是啊… 我是说…012---Yeah. I mean, you know, if...
我是说如果是我的话  我会希望你…012---I mean if it were me, I'd, you know, want you to...
怎样  在我没防备时来个真正…012---What? I don't know, catch me off guard. You know, with, like, a really...
棒的亲吻012---...good kiss.
就是…012---You know, really...
刚开始是轻柔的亲吻012---...sort of, um, soft at first.
然后拨开我脸上的头发012---And then maybe, um, brush the hair away from my face.
然后深情的看着我012---And then look far into my eyes...
让我知道有件…012---...in a way that lets me know something...
美好的事即将发生012---...amazing is about to happen.
哦-哼012---Uh-huh.
然后  我不知道…012---And then, I don't know, then...
你会把我拉得很近012---...you'd pull me really close to you so that...
让我就紧贴在你身上012---So that I'd be pressed up, you know, right against you.
那样就会有种…012---And, um, it would get kind of...
汗涔涔012---...sweaty...
朦朦胧胧的感觉012---...and, uh... And blurry.
于是就这样发生了012---And then it's just happening.
噢012---Oh.
谢了  瑞秋  晚安012---Thanks, Rach. Good night.
喔  天啊012---Oh, God.
早安012---Good morning.
昨晚有人很乐喔012---Well, somebody got some last night.
两次012---Twice.
唉  我真想念茱莉012---Man, I sure miss Julie.
西班牙侏儒012---Spanish midgets.
西班牙侏儒摔跤…012---Spanish midgets wrestling...
茱莉  好  是的  我懂你为何会这样联想012---Julie. Okay, yes, I see how you got there.
你搞清楚了那玩意的用途吗012---You ever figure out what that thing's for?
不  是这样的  我在试着过滤电话012---No, see, I'm trying this screening thing.
我认为我老是接电话  人们会觉得我生活贫乏012---I figure if I always answer the phone, people will think I don't have a life.
我的天  罗德里哥从来不会被压制012---My God. Rodrigo never gets pinned.
哔声要来了  你知道该怎么做012---Here comes the beep. You know what to do.
你好  我要找巴伯012---Hello. I'm looking for Bob.
我是洁德012---This is Jade.
我不知道你是否还用这号码  但我只是想到彼此012---I don't know if you're still at this number, but I was just thinking about us...
和以前有多棒  我知道那已是三年前的事  但…012---...and how great it was, and, well, I know it's been three years...
我有点希望我们能再次碰头012---...but I was kind of hoping we could hook up again.
你知道吗  我几乎没勇气打这通电话012---You know, I barely had the nerve to make this call...
所以你知道我做了什么吗   什么012---...so you know what I did? - What?
我喝得微醺012---I got a little drunk...
还全身赤裸012---...and naked.
我是巴伯012---Bob here.

太好了  到时见  好012---Great. I'll see you then. Okay.
很好012---Okay.
装电话终于值得了012---Having a phone has finally paid off.
就算你模仿巴伯很像012---Even though you do do a good Bob impression...
我想她明天见到你时012---...I'm thinking when she sees you tomorrow...
她大概会发现  嘿  你不是巴伯012---...she's probably gonna realize, hey, you're not Bob.
我希望的是  当巴伯放她鸽子的时候012---I am hoping that when Bob doesn't show up...
她会投向邻桌的陌生人的怀抱012---...she will seek comfort in the open arms of the wry stranger at the next table.
我的天  你邪恶到极点012---Oh, my God. You are pure evil.
好  邪恶到极点012---Okay, pure evil...
欲望难耐又孤单012---...horny and alone.

大家欠我六十二元  用来庆祝他生日012---...everybody owes me 62 bucks for his birthday.
有没有可能 你取个整数就好012---Um, is there any chance that you're rounding up from...
像是二十元012---...you know, from like 20?
拜托  我们要买礼物  看演唱会和买蛋糕012---Hey, come on, we got the gift, the concert and the cake.
我们需要蛋糕012---Do we need a cake?
听着  我知道金额有点高012---Look, I know it's a little steep.

做一件事012---...do a thing.
好  亲爱的  我今晚再打给你012---Okay, sweetheart, I'll call you later tonight.
等等  你不会真的要这么做吧012---Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, you're not really going through with this, are you?
我想我也许就会012---You know, I think I might just.
那么你们今晚晚上吃什么012---So, uh, what are you guys doing for dinner tonight?
我想我必须开始为罗斯的生日存钱012---Well, I guess I gotta start saving up for Ross' birthday.
所以我可能会留在家里吃西北风了012---So I guess I'll just stay home and eat dust bunnies.
你们能相信这要花那么多钱吗012---Can you believe how much this is gonna cost?
你们有没有过这种感觉…012---Do you guys ever get the feeling that, um...
钱德和他们几个…012---...Chandler and those guys...
不了解我们赚的钱不如他们多012---...just don't get that we don't make as much money as they do?
对  真的012---Yes. Really?
他们老是说 〝去这里 去那里〞012---It's like they're always saying, "Let's go here, let's go there."
好像我们真的有那个闲钱一样   对012---Like we can afford to go here and there.  Yeah.
而且我们总是得去“好地方” 你知道吗012---Yes, and we always have to go to, you know, someplace nice, you know?
我们连反对的权利都没有  因为这是Ross的生日012---It's not like we can say anything about it, because, like, this is a birthday thing...
而且是为了罗斯012---...you know, and it's for Ross.
为了罗斯   为了罗斯012---For Ross. For Ross.
我的天啊012---Oh, my God.

是这样的  我在工作012---Okay. I'm at work...

突然间经理里昂  叫我到他办公室012---All of a sudden, Leon, the manager, calls me into his office.
原来他们开除了午餐主厨  猜猜谁取代他的职位了012---Turns out they fired the head lunch chef, and guess who got the job.
假如不是你  这故事还真悲惨012---If it's not you, this is a horrible story.
幸好是我012---Fortunately, it is me. Oh.
而且他们升我为采购主管  感激不尽012---And they made me head of purchasing, thank you very much.
真棒012---That's so cool.
我刚刚在楼下碰到钱德和罗斯  我们应该出外庆祝012---Anyway, I just ran into Chandler and Ross. We should go out and celebrate.

我不能告诉她  我的号码是我的号码012---I couldn't tell her my number was my number...
因为她以为我的号码是巴伯的号码012---...because she thinks my number is Bob's number.
再告诉我一次  当古板房东罗普打来  我该怎么做012---Hey, tell me again. What do I do when Mr. Roper calls?

你说得对  真抱歉012---Oh. You're right, I'm sorry.
谢谢012---Thank you.
今晚是摩妮卡的大日子  她不该付钱012---It's Monica's big night. She shouldn't pay.
谢谢012---Aw, thank you.
所以我们五个人…012---So five of us is...
各付三十三块半012---...33.50 apiece.
不  才不要  抱歉  不可能012---No. Uh-uh. No way. Sorry, not gonna happen.
像是毕业舞会情景重演012---Whoa. Whoa. Prom night flashback.
抱歉  摩妮卡  我真的很高兴你升迁012---Sorry, Monica. I'm really happy you got promoted...
但是冷黄瓜糊要三十几元012---...but cold cucumber mush for 30-something bucks?
不012---No.
瑞秋只吃了一小份沙拉012---Rachel just had that little salad...
乔伊则吃他的一小块彼萨012---...and Joey with his, like, teeny pizza.
好  菲比012---Okay, Pheebs.
不如我们各付各的  好吗012---How about we'll each just pay for what we had, okay?
没什么大不了  对你是这样012---It's no big deal.  Not for you.
好了  怎么回事012---All right, what's going on?
好吧  听着  我现在真的不想淌这浑水012---Okay, look, I really don't wanna get into this right now.
这只会让大家都不舒服  好  没关系  好012---It'll just make everybody uncomfortable. Oh, fine. All right, fine.
干嘛   你能告诉我们012---What? Whoa, whoa. You can tell us.
对  拜托  是我们  好吗  我们能接受012---Yeah, hello? It's us. All right? We'll be fine.
是啊012---Yeah.
唔  好的  恩012---Ahem. Okay, um...
我们三个觉得…012---Uh, we three feel like that, uh, ahem...
有时候你们不了解…012---...sometimes you guys don't get that, uh, ahem...
我们的钱不如你们多012---We don't have as much money as you.
好  我听到了012---Okay. I hear you.
我们能讨论这件事012---We can talk about that.
那么…012---Well, then...
就来…012---...let's.
我猜我从没想到  钱会构成问题012---Well, um, I guess I just never think of money as an issue.
因为你有钱  这一点说得好012---That's because you have it. That's a good point.
那么… 你们为何以前从没提过这件事012---So, um, how come you guys haven't talked about this before?
因为总是有事情发生  像是摩妮卡的新职位012---Because it's always something, you know? Like with Monica's new job...
或是罗斯生日要盛大庆祝012---...or the whole Ross' birthday hoopla.
什么  嘿…012---What? Whoa, hey.
我不希望我的生日  造成任何负面…012---I don't want my birthday to be the source of any kind of negative...
到时候会有盛大庆祝012---There's gonna be a hoopla?
基本上有那玩意  然后还有那玩意后的事…012---Basically there's the thing, and then the stuff after the thing and it's...
假如这会让大家好过些  我们可以别管那玩意012---If it makes anybody feel better, we can just forget the thing...
只要送礼就好012---...and we'll just do the gift.
礼物  那玩意不是礼物012---Gift? The thing's not the gift?
不  那玩意是  我们要去看混混与自大狂合唱团012---No, the thing was we were gonna go see Hootie and the Blowfish.
混混与…我的天  我听广播就听得到他们的歌012---Hootie and the... Oh, my... I can catch them on the radio.
不  现在我觉得内疚了  你想去参加演唱会012---No. Now I feel bad. You wanna go to the concert.
不  听着  这是我生日012---No, look, hey, it's my birthday...
最重要的是我们能一起欢庆012---...and the important thing is that we all be together.
我们所有人  在一起012---All of us.  Together.
不是在演唱会场012---Not at the concert.
好的  谢  谢了012---Okay. Thank you. - Thanks.
耶012---Yeah.
所以说  伊波拉病毒  真要命吧012---So, the Ebola virus. That's gotta suck, huh?
天呀  摩妮卡  袋子里有什么012---Gee, Monica. What's in the bag?
我不知道  钱德咱们来看看012---I don't know, Chandler. Let's take a look.
像是短剧表演012---Oh, it's like a skit.
原来是六人晚餐  五块牛排012---Why, it's dinner for six. Five steaks...
和给菲比的一条茄子012---...and an eggplant for Phoebe.
我们工作地点换了肉类供应商  新商家给我牛排当谢礼012---We switched meat suppliers at work, and they gave me the steaks as a thank-you.
但是等等  还有 钱德  那信封里有什么012---But wait, there's more. Hey, Chandler, what is in that envelope?
顺带一提  在走廊练习时好像没那么呆012---By the way, this didn't seem so dorky out in the hall.
快点012---Come on.
原来是混混与自大狂合唱团的六张门票012---Why, it's six tickets to Hootie and the Blowfish.
自大狂012---The Blowfish.
我们请客  好吗  所以别担心  由我们招待012---It's on us, all right? So don't worry. This is our treat.
所以…谢谢012---So... thank you.
你们能更冷淡一点吗012---Could you be less enthused?
听着  这是很好的表示  真的012---Look, it's a nice gesture. It is.
可是感觉就像…012---But it just feels like...
像…012---Like?
施舍  施舍012---Charity.  Charity?
我们只是想做好事012---We're just trying to do a nice thing here.
但是  罗斯  你必须了解  你的好事令我们觉得好渺小012---But, Ross, you have to understand, your nice thing makes us feel about this big.
其实是令我们觉得这么渺小012---Actually, it makes us feel that big.
为什么  我不懂  我们好像怎么做  你们都觉得不对012---What? I don't understand. I mean, it's like we can't win with you guys.
假如你们觉得这么渺小  也许那不是我们的错012---If you guys feel this big, maybe that's not our fault.
也许那只是你们的感受012---Maybe that's just how you feel.
噢012---Oh.
你现在断定我们的感受   我们不该说起这件事的012---Now you're telling us how we feel. We never should have talked about this.
我要谢绝演唱会012---I'm gonna pass on the concert...
因为我现在没心情听混混012---...because I'm just not in a very Hootie place right now.
我也一样  我也是012---Me neither.  Me too.
各位  我们买了门票012---Guys, we bought the tickets.
那么你们有额外座位  让你们放皇冠等等012---Well, then you'll have extra seats, you know, for all your tiaras and stuff.
你说的时候为何看着我012---Why did you look at me when you said that?
所以我想我们不能去了012---So I guess now we can't go.
拜托  你们想做什么就做  我们非得做什么都在一起吗012---Come on, do what you want. Do we always have to do everything together?
知道吗  你说得对012---You know what? You're right.
好  好012---Fine.  Fine.
好  好012---Fine.  Fine.
好  好的012---Fine. All right.
我们要去了012---We're gonna go.
还有六小时才开始  我们到时候再去012---It's not for another six hours. We're gonna go then.
钱德  有012---Chandler? Yeah.
天啊012---Oh, jeez.
你准备好没  好了012---Are you ready?  Yes.
让我拿西装外套  跟你说我今天跟人上床了012---Just let me grab my jacket and tell you I had sex today. Whoa, whoa.
什么  你今天跟人上床012---What? You had sex today?
由别人说这句话  听起来更酷012---Wow. It sounds even cooler when somebody else says it.
我很厉害  好吗  她拼命咬着嘴唇  才不会尖叫出来012---I was awesome, okay? She was biting her lip to stop from screaming.
哇噢012---Wow.
我知道我有阵子没做了  但我把那当成好的迹象012---Now, I know it's been a while, but I took that as a good sign.
还在过滤电话012---Still doing the screening thing?
我今天跟人上床了012---I had sex today.
我永远不必再接电话了012---I never have to answer that phone again.
哔声要来了  你知道该怎么做012---Here comes the beep. You know what to do.
嘿  巴伯  是我洁德  听着…012---Hey, Bob. It's Jade.
我只想告诉你  你前几天没出现  让我好受伤012---I just wanted to tell you I was really hurt when you didn't show up the other day.
所以告诉你  我最后认识了一个男的012---And just so you know, I ended up meeting a guy.
我是巴伯012---Bob here.
喔  嗨012---Oh, hi.
你认识了别人吗012---So, uh, you met someone, huh?
是的  我认识了别人012---Yes. Yes, I did.
事实上  我两小时前跟他上了床012---In fact, I had sex with him two hours ago.
那么他表现怎样012---So, uh, how was he?
哦012---Eh...
呃012---"Eh"?
巴伯  他根本比不上你012---Oh, Bob, he was nothing compared to you.
我必须咬着嘴唇  才不会叫出你的名字012---I had to bite my lip to keep from screaming your name.
那令我真欣慰012---Well, that makes me feel so good.
过程很笨拙又颠簸012---It was just so awkward and bumpy.
颠簸012---Bumpy?
也许他有某种很酷的新风格  只是你不熟悉012---Maybe he had some kind of, uh, new cool style that you're not familiar with.
也许你只要习惯就好012---And, uh, maybe you have to get used to it.
没多少时间能让我习惯  你懂我意思吧012---There wasn't much time to get used to it... ...if you know what I mean.
你知道吗  我没办法乐在其中012---You know what? I'm not gonna be able to enjoy this.
对  我懂  这是我生日  我们应该全都在场012---Yeah, I know. It's my birthday. We all should be here.
那么走吧012---So let's go.
也许我们该留下来听一首歌012---Well, you know, maybe we should stay for one song.
对  假如我们现在离开  对他们很没礼貌012---Yeah, I mean, it would be rude to them for us to leave now.
再说  他们可能也过得很高兴012---You know, the guys are probably having a great time.
拜托  两位  再一次012---Come on, you guys. One more time.
好的012---Okay.
不是012---One. - No.
谢谢大家  我们是混混与自大狂012---Thank you very much. We are Hootie & The Blowfish.
好精彩   太棒了012---That was amazing.  Excellent.
我不敢相信他们错过这场012---I can't believe the guys missed this.
什么人  喔  对了012---What guys? Oh, yeah.
打扰一下  你是摩妮卡·盖勒吗012---Excuse me. You're Monica Geller, aren't you?
我认识你吗   你以前是我的保姆012---Do I know you? You used to be my baby-sitter.
我的天  小史提夫·费雪012---Oh, my God. Little Stevie Fisher?
你近来好吗012---How have you been?
很好  我现在是律师012---Good, good. I'm a lawyer now.
你不可能是律师  你才八岁012---You can't be a lawyer. You're 8.
听着  很高兴见到你  我得回后台了012---Well, listen, it was nice to see you. I gotta run backstage.
等等  后台  对  我的事务所代表这乐团012---Wait, backstage? Oh, yeah. My firm represents the band.
罗斯  钱德012---Ross.  Chandler.
你们想跟乐团见面吗    对  我们想012---Look, you guys wanna meet the group?  Yeah, we do.
来吧012---Come on.
听着  你是跟我爸乱搞的保姆之一吗012---So, look, are you one of the ones that fooled around with my dad?
你们好  生日快乐012---Hey, you guys. Happy birthday.
谢谢…012---Oh, thank you. Thanks.
所以…012---So, uh...
你们昨晚过得怎样012---How was your night last night?
蛮逊的  你们呢012---Oh, well, it pretty much sucked. How was yours?
我们的也很逊012---Yeah, ours pretty much sucked too.
但是我提到小史提夫·费雪  记得他吗012---Oh, but I did run into Stevie Fisher. Remember him?
对  我以前当过他保姆012---Oh, yeah. I used to baby-sit him.
他爸还好吗012---Hey, how's his dad?
很好012---Good.
除此之外  整个晚上实在没什么好提的012---Uh, aside from that, the whole evening was pretty much a bust.
对  我们很想你们012---Yeah, we really missed you guys.
听着  我们想说  这整件事真是太傻了012---Yeah, look, we were just saying, this whole thing is so stupid.
我们必须真的不让金钱之类的事  影响到…012---We just have to really, really not let stuff like money, get like...
那是草莓吗012---Is that a hickey?
不  我只是…012---Oh, ha, ha, no, I just...
我跌倒了012---I fell down.
倒在别人嘴唇上012---On someone's lips?
你的草莓从哪来的012---Where'd you get the hickey?
大概是派对或…  什么派对012---You know, a party or...  What party?
其实不太算派对  只是一群人聚在一起012---Well, it wasn't a party so much as a... A gathering of people.
有食物和音乐和…012---With food and music and...
和乐团012---And the band.
你们跟混混与自大狂一起参加派对012---You partied with Hootie and the Blowfish?
对  显然史提夫和混混很熟012---Yes. Apparently, Stevie and Hootie are like this.
谁给你那草莓的012---Who gave you that hickey?
应该是其中一个自大狂的012---That would be the work of a Blowfish.
我不敢相信…012---I can't believe it. I can't believe this.
我们只是呆坐在家 试着猜乔伊比几根手指012---We're just sitting at home, trying to guess Joey's fingers...
你们则在外面狂欢  玩得很开心012---...and you guys are out, like, partying and having fun and all:
〝自大狂  来吸我的脖子〞012---"Hey, Blowfish, suck on my neck."
听着  别怪我们  你们原本可以在场012---Hey, look, don't blame us. You guys could've been there.
干嘛  参与你的穷朋友施舍计划012---Oh, what? As part of your Poor Friends Outreach program?
太好了  公司打来的012---Oh, great. It's work.
我不知道该说什么  很遗憾我们赚得比你们多012---Look, I don't know what to say. I'm sorry that we make more than you.
但我们不打算觉得愧疚  我们是辛苦工作得到的012---But we're not gonna feel guilty about it. We work really hard for it.
那我们没辛苦工作吗012---And we don't work hard?
对  我是摩妮卡  有人呼叫我012---Yeah, hi, it's Monica. I got a page.
我只是说 有时我们想做会比较花钱的事012---I'm just saying that sometimes we like to do stuff that costs a little more.
你觉得我们成了你的绊脚石  对012---Oh, and you feel like we hold you back.  Yes.
不对012---No.
里昂  等一下  大家安静012---Leon, wait. Shh! Guys.
等等  我不了解012---Wait, I don't understand.
那些牛排只是肉商的礼物012---Those steaks were just a gift from the meat vendor.
那不是回扣012---That was not a kickback.
拜托  我会补回去  我们就能忘掉这整件事012---Come on, I'll just replace them and we can forget the whole thing.
什么企业政策012---What corporate policy?
是012---Yeah.
好的012---Okay.
我刚刚被开除了012---I just got fired.
这是你的帐单  四点一二元012---WAITRESS: Here's your check. That'll be 4.12.
我来付012---Let me get that.
你有五元吗012---You got 5 bucks?
哔声要来了  你知道该怎么做012---Here comes the beep. You know what to do.
嗨  是我012---Hi, it's me.
听着  巴伯  也许我不该做这样的要求012---Listen, Bob, I'm probably way out of line here.
毕竟已经过了三年  你可能正在跟别人交往012---I mean, it has been three years, and you're probably seeing someone else now...
但是假如我们能共度一晚  看在往日的份上012---...but if we could just have one night together, just for old time's sake...
干柴烈火的一晚…012---One hot, steamy, wild night...
谁是乖宝宝啊012---Who the winny-binny boy?
乖宝宝就是你012---Oh, you the winny-winny-binny-binny boy!
好的012---Yes.
别哭012---Don't cry.
别哭012---Don't cry, huh?
他为什么还哭012---Why is he still crying?
让我抱一下012---Let me hold him for a sec.
来吧012---Here we go. Huh?
好  不哭了012---Huh. There we are.
或许是我的缘故012---Maybe it's me.
别傻了  小班爱你  他今天是闹别扭先生012---Don't be silly. Ben loves you. He's just being Mr. Cranky Pants.
我从前和一个爱闹别扭小姐交往过012---You know, I once dated a Miss Cranky Pants.
挺可爱的  就是比较情绪化012---Lovely girl. Kind of moody.
好了  他不哭了012---There we go, all better.
可爱小乖宝012---There's my little boy. Eh.
让我看一下好吗012---Can I, uh, see something?
好酷  他恨我012---Cool!  He hates me.
我侄子讨厌我   别这么说012---My nephew hates me!  Come on, don't do this.
万一我的孩子讨厌我呢   我该怎么办012---What if my own baby hates me, huh? What do I do then?
摩妮卡  别这样012---Monica, stop! This is nuts.
你可知道你得等多久  才会烦恼那个问题012---Do you know how long it's gonna be before you actually have to deal with this problem?
你现在连男朋友都没有012---You don't even have a boyfriend yet.
乔伊  她看起来并不胖012---Joey, she does not look fat.

奇异果  奇异果012---Kiwi? Kiwi?!
你说这是柠檬派012---You said it was a key lime pie.
不  我说是奇异果柠檬派  与众不同之处012---No, I didn't. I said kiwi lime. That's what makes it so special.
所以我才会死012---That's what's gonna kill me.
我对奇异果过敏012---Ahem. I'm allergic to kiwi.

不行  恕难从命012---Uh. Ha, I don't think so.
怎么  我有七个天主教姊妹  我照顾过上百个孩子012---What? I have seven Catholic sisters. I've taken care of hundreds of kids.

还是没搞头  没有  完全没搞头012---The guy still won't put out? Nope. Zilch. Nothing. Uh-uh.
真遗憾  菲比  真遗憾  菲比012---Sorry, Pheebs.  Sorry, Pheebs.
我不介意慢慢来  我很喜欢他012---Well, look, I don't mind taking it slow. I like him a lot.
他很风趣又很体贴012---He's really interesting, and he's really sweet.
他干嘛不肯放开矜持012---Why won't he give it up?
搞不好他是〝另外一边的〞012---Maybe he, uh, drives his car on the other side of the road.
你晓得我的意思…012---If you know what I mean.
我不懂  什么意思  他又不是英国人012---No. What do you mean? He's not British.
或许他是同志012---Maybe he's gay. Oh!
我觉得不太可能012---Um, no, I don't think that's the problem.
我们前几天去跳舞…012---We went, um, dancing the other night...
…他紧紧抱住我的那个样子  还有他凝视我眼睛的样子…012---...and just the way he held me so close and the way he was looking into my eyes...
让我真的有触电的感觉012---...I just definitely felt something.
但是眼神能看出什么呢012---Yeah, but how much can you tell from a look?
不  我是从屁股感觉到的012---No, I felt it on my hip. I could tell.
哟  宾  二十分钟后去打壁球012---Yo, Bing! Racquetball in 20 minutes.
乔伊  行行好  把我的手抬起来揍她一拳012---Joey, be a pal. Lift up my hand and smack her with it. Heh.
喔  瑞秋  别看  什么012---Ooh. Oh, Rachel! Don't look. What?
拜托  我才不在乎  我今晚有约会呢012---Come on, guys. I don't care. I have a date tonight.
你有约会  摩妮卡帮我介绍的012---Whoa, whoa, whoa. You have a date? Yeah. Monica's setting me up.
那罗斯和…012---Heh, now, what about, uh, Ross and...
什么  我很爱乱吃醋的事吗012---What? My whole insane jealousy thing?
虽然这整件事还挺有趣的...012---Well, you know, as much fun as that was...
我决定还是好好过日子012---...I've decided to opt for sanity.
你真的不介意那些了012---So you're okay about all this?
喔  当然 少来了  我还要过我的日子呢012---Oh, yeah, come on! I'm moving on.
他爱怎么把她压在那扇窗子上就怎么压吧012---He can press her up against that window as much as he wants.
与我无关  他干脆把她摔过那该死的窗子算了012---For all I care, he can throw her through the damn thing.
嗨  各位  嘿012---Hi, guys.Hey.
摩妮卡  我明早过来拿毛毛的玩具012---Monica, I figured I'd come by tomorrow and pick up Fluffy's old cat toys, okay?
你得说出他的全名才行012---Only if you say his full name.
我明天是否能过来拿喵毛毛的旧玩具012---Can I come over tomorrow and pick up Fluffy Meowington's cat toys?
好的  你要养猫012---All right. You're getting a cat?
事实上  是我们要养的012---Actually, we're getting a cat. Heh.
一起012---Together? Uh-huh.
你们俩  一起   对012---Both of you? Together? Yup.
他一半时间和我住  一半时间和他住012---It'll live with Ross half the time and me half the time.
喔…012---Oh, well...
可真幸福 很棒012---...isn't that just lovely? Ha, ha.
你们俩将可以…012---That's something the two of you will be able to enjoy...
享受这种感觉好长好长一段时间呢012---...for a really, really, really long time.
希望如此012---Hopefully.Oh, wow.
哎呀  我得走了  我要去约会呢012---Whoa! Look at that. I gotta go! I got a date!
和男人约会 好吧012---With a man. Ahem, okay.
祝你们大家晚安…012---You guys have a really, uh, good night...
祝你们两个得到一只好猫012---...and you two have a, uh, really good cat. Heh.
离开店时不能把这拿走的012---We're not supposed to take these when we leave.
我不晓得摩妮卡有没有告诉你  这是我离婚之后第一次约会012---I don't know if Monica told you... ...but this the first date I've gone on since my divorce.
我或许有点紧张  事实上我是的012---So if I seem a little nervous... ...I am.
猫能活多久012---How long do cats live?
什么  猫通常能活几年012---I'm sorry? Cats. How long do they live?
如果不是把他们丢到巴士底下的话…012---Figuring you don't throw them under a bus or something?
大概十五  六年吧   那可真好啊012---Um, maybe 15, 16 years. Well, that's just great.
干杯012---Um, cheers. Mm.
是啊…当012---Right. Clink. Heh.
摩妮卡把我形容得比本人帅  是吧012---Monica told you I was cuter than this, didn't she?
噢  不  麦可 和你没关系…012---Oh, no, Michael, it's not you.
对不起  是这样的…012---Sorry. It's just... It's this thing.
或许听起来很奇怪…012---It's probably not as bad as it sounds...
但我有个朋友和他的女朋友正打算养一只猫012---...but this friend of mine is getting a cat with his girlfriend.
喔  那的确是…012---Oh, that does sound...
他才刚和她交往012---Huh. He just started going out with her.
他是你前任男友吗012---Ahem. Is this guy, uh, an old boyfriend?
他想得美喔012---Yeah, he wishes.
对不起  你瞧瞧我012---Oh, I'm sorry. Look at me.
麦可  谈谈你吧012---Okay, Michael, let's talk about you.
好的  好的012---All right. Okay. Okay?
所以…012---So...
你曾经和女友一起养过宠物吗012---Did you ever get a pet with a girlfriend?
我明白怎么回事情了  什么012---So I figured it out.  What?
为什么史考特不想和我上床012---Why Scott doesn't want to sleep with me.
因为我不够性感012---'Cause I'm not sexy enough.
菲比  那太扯了吧012---Heh, Phoebe, that's crazy.
我刚认识你时  你知道我怎么对钱德说的吗012---When I first met you, you know what I said to Chandler?
我说“前突后翘 有看头”012---Mm-mm. I said, "Excellent butt, great rack."
真的吗  你真好012---Really? That's so sweet.
我觉得被冒犯 可是感觉真好012---I mean, I'm officially offended. But that's so sweet.
如果你真想知道实情  你得亲自问他012---Look, if you wanna know what the deal is, you're gonna have to ask him.
你说得对  没错012---You're right. You're right.
你好可爱喔012---Ugh, you are so yum!
只不过是一只猫  你知道  只是只猫012---I mean, it's a cat, you know? It's a cat.
他们干嘛不养虫子  养果蝇嘛012---Why can't they get one of those bugs? One of those fruit flies.
那种只活一天的  叫什么来着012---Those things that live for a day. What are they called? What are they called?
果蝇  没错012---Fruit flies?  Yes!
谢谢你  你们要吃甜点吗012---Thank you. Would you like any dessert?
不要  不要甜点012---No! No dessert.
我们要买单  拜托012---Just the check. Please.
喔  糟糕  和我约会很不好玩吧012---Oh, no. You're not having fun, are you?
不  不  很好玩…012---No, no, I am.
不过刚才那一个半小时我都在回忆“餐馆”的情节012---but only because for the last hour and a half I've been playing the movie Diner in my head.
喔  我真是的…012---Oh, look at me.
瞧瞧我012---Look at me.
我正在和一个很棒的男人约会…012---Oh, I'm on a date with a really great guy.
我心里却只想着罗斯和他的猫…012---All I can think about is Ross... ...and his cat...
还有他的茱莉012---...and his Julie.
我只想忘了他  为什么我办不到呢012---I just want to get over him. God, why can't I do that?
喔012---Oy.
我离过婚  相信我  你会没事的012---Look, I've been through a divorce. Trust me, you're gonna be fine.
你只是心结未解012---You can't see it because you haven't had closure...
啊012---Aah!
解开心结012---Closure!
这就对了  那正是我需要的012---That's what it is. That's what I need.
老天  你真聪明012---God, you're brilliant!
我为什么之前没想到   要如何解开心结呢012---Why didn't I think of that? How do I get that?
并没有绝对的可行办法012---Well, there's no one way really, it's just...
有各种不同的办法  好让你对他说…012---Whatever it takes so that you can finally say to him:
我不在乎你了012---"I'm over you."
不在乎你012---Over you.
那正是关键012---That's what it is.
解开心结012---Closure.
哈罗…对不起…012---Hello? Excuse me?
对不起…哎唷…012---Excuse me. Hel... Whoo!
等等  对不起…012---Hang on.  Hello? Excuse me?
干嘛   嗨…抱歉…012---What? Hi. I'm sorry.
电话借我一分钟012---I need to borrow your phone for just one minute.
我正在讲电话  我看得出来012---I'm talking.  I see that.
我打一个电话  就可以了很快的  我可以付你钱012---It's one phone call, I'll be very quick. I'll even pay for it myself.
你有点小气喔  不肯借人电话012---Okay, you're being a little weird about your phone.
好吧012---All right. Fine.
好  我再打给你012---I'll call you back.
谢谢012---Thank you.
好012---Okay.
是答录机012---Machine.
等哔声过后就可以讲    那很好012---Just waiting for the beep.  Good.
罗斯  嗨  是我  瑞秋012---Ross! Hi, it's Rachel.
我打电话来要告诉你…012---I'm just calling to say that, um...
一切都很好  我很为你高兴012---...everything's fine. And I'm really happy for you...
还有你的猫012---...and your cat.
还有  你应该给你的猫取名叫麦可012---Who, by the way, I think you should name Michael.
瞧  我连名字都想好了…012---And you see there, I'm thinking of names...
显然我不在乎你了012---...so obviously I am over you.
我不在乎你了012---I am over you.
这就是我那位朋友所谓的〝解开心结〞012---And that, my friend, is what they call "closure."
不  不  不  不  不  不012---No, no, no, no, no, no.
不012---No!
今天是星期天  我星期天不跑步012---Monica, it's Sunday morning. I'm not running on a Sunday.
为什么   因为是星期天012---Why not?  Because it's Sunday!
是上帝叫人休息的日子012---It's God's day.
嘿  只要你想停  我们就停012---Ha, hey. If you say stop, then we stop.
好012---Ha, ha, okay.
停012---Stop.
不行  不能停啊  还有三磅要减012---No, come on! We can't stop! We got three more pounds to go!
我是精力充沛的火车而你在车上012---I am the energy train and you are on board
唔012---Whoo.
嘿  瑞秋…012---Hey, Rach. Mm.
约会约得如何012---Oh. And how was the date? Ugh.

你为什么那样看我012---What? Why are you looking at me like that? Heh.
对不起  我不晓得  我…012---Ahem, I'm sorry. I don't know, I...
我好像梦到了你…012---I feel like I had a dream about you last night...
但我不记得了012---...but I don't remember.
好吧012---Okay. Heh.
噢…在那里012---Oh, oh, oh. There they are. Ahem.
我们昨晚有讲电话吗  你是不是打给我012---Did we speak on the phone? Did you call me?
没有  我昨晚在茱莉那里过夜012---No. I stayed at Julie's last night.
我根本还没回家呢  介意我听一下留言吗012---Huh. - Oh, I haven't even been home yet. Do you mind if I check my messages?
喔  好啊  你查012---Oh, yeah, go ahead.

钱德告诉我了  他什么时候讲的 他012---Chandler told me. When did he...? When did he...? When did he?
你去中国…  中国012---When you were in China.  China.
遇见茱莉的时候  菜莉012---Meeting Julie.  Julie.
茱莉  这… 喔  老天012---Julie. That's... Oh, God.
茱莉…对喔012---Julie? Julie, right.
好  我必须躺下012---Okay, I need to lie down.
不  我要站着  我得站着…  好012---No, I'm gonna stand. I'm gonna stand... Okay.
我还要走动一下 我要踱步我踱步012---...and I'm gonna walk. I'm walking and I am standing.
所以你…012---Okay, so you, uh?
现在  现在…012---And now, what? Now...? Now.

等等  你要走了012---Wait, so you're going?
我得走  我现在没办法处理这件事012---Well, okay, I, uh... I have to. I can't deal with this right now.
计程车在等我  我有个女朋友012---I mean, I've, uh... Heh. You know, I've got a cab. I've got a girlfriend.
我还要去领养一只猫012---I'm gonna go get a cat.
好012---Okay. Okay.
猫012---Cat!
嘿   乔伊  嘿  菲比012---Hey, Joey.  Hey, Pheebs.
你干嘛看犹太牧师弹电吉他012---How come you're watching a rabbi play electric guitar?
我找不到摇控器012---I can't find the remote.
谢谢你012---Ugh, thank you. Heh.
史考特找我去他家吃午餐  我去了012---So, Scott asked me to come over for lunch and I did.
然后呢  我们做了012---And? And we did.
好耶  太棒了  菲比   我好棒012---All right, Pheebs! Way to go! Yay, me. Ha, ha.
怎么发生的012---So how did it happen?
我听了你的建议  问他到底怎么回事啊012---I finally took your advice and asked him what was going on.
他怎么说  他说…012---What did he say?  He said that...
他知道女人对性特别感情用事012---...he understands how sex can be a very emotional thing for a woman.
他之前是怕我会胡思乱想…012---And he was just afraid that I was going to get all, you know:
担心他隔天会不会打电话  和他有没有未来012---"Is he gonna call me the next day?" And "Where is this going?" and:
他说他想等到他准备好定下来才做那件事012---So he said he wanted to hold off until he was prepared to be serious.
是啊  结果我便劝他…012---Yeah. So I said,
别紧张  放轻松…012---"Okay. Relax, please." You know?
性有可能只是一时干柴烈火的反应012---I mean, sex can be just about two people right there in the moment.
如果他想再和我约会  他再打来没关系  不打也没关系012---If he wants to see me again, he can call. If not, that's fine too.
结果我们谈了很久…012---So after a lot of talking, heh...
最后我说服他了012---...I convinced him. Heh!
让我把这件事搞清楚  他让你去求他上床012---Let me get this straight. He got you to beg to sleep with him.
他让你自己开口说  他不用打电话给你012---He got you to say he never has to call you again.
他还让你认为这是个好主意012---And he got you thinking this is a great idea?
嗯-哼012---Uh-huh.
这个家伙真的是我的偶像012---This man is my god.
晚安012---Good night.
嗨  我没领养猫012---Hi. I didn't get a cat.
喔  这下可有意思了012---Oh, that's, um, interesting.
不  一点也没有意思  非常没意思012---No. No, it's not interesting. Okay? It's very, very not interesting.
事实上一点意思都没有012---It's actually a hundred percent the opposite of interesting.
我懂了  罗斯012---I got it, Ross.
你无权告诉我你曾经喜欢过我012---You had no right to tell me you ever had feelings for me.
什么  在我发现之前我过得好好的012---What?  I was doing great with Julie before I found out about you.
在我发现之前我也过得好好的！012---I was doing great before I found out about you!
看到你和茱莉在一起  我心里好受吗012---You think it's easy for me to see you with Julie?
你应该在我认识她之前说出来012---You should've said something before I met her.
那时我不知道啊  那你为何从不说什么呢012---I didn't know then. And how come you never said anything to me?
因为总没有机会012---There was never a good time.
你有一整年的时间  我们还每晚都一起混012---You only had a year. And we only hung out every night!
不是…不是012---Not... Not... Not...
每个晚上012---...every night.
不是我没尝试  每次都有事情发生012---It's not like I didn't try. But things got in the way.
像那些意大利男人  还有前任未婚夫…012---You know, like Italian guys... ...or ex-fiancés, or... Or... Or...
还有那些意大利男人012---Italian guys.
只有一个意大利男人 你的重点是012---There was one Italian guy, okay? And do you have a point?
重点是  我现在没办法处理这件事012---The point is, I don't need this right now!
好吧  已经太迟了012---Okay? It's too late.
我身边已经有人 我很快乐这艘船开航了012---I'm with somebody else. I'm happy. This ship has sailed!
你喜欢什么时候抛开感情都可以吗012---You're just gonna put away feelings or whatever it was you felt for me?
我从初三就开始这么做了 我对这蛮在行的012---I've done it since ninth grade. I've gotten good at it.
好啊  你就继续这么做吧012---All right, fine. You go ahead and do that, Ross.
我才不要坐你的蠢船012---I don't need your stupid ship!
好  很好012---Good.  Good!
还有  我现在已经解开心结了012---And you know what? Now I got closure!
最下面那个012---Try the bottom one.
摩妮卡  现在是清晨六点半012---Monica, it's 6:30 in the morning.
我们不锻炼了 结束了012---We're not working out. It's over.
怎么啦  只剩一磅  来啦012---No way! With one pound to go? Come on!
咱们要不断努力  加油012---We're workin', we're movin' We're in the zone, we're groovin'
最后一磅我无所谓012---Okay, I don't mind the last pound.
老实讲  我还挺喜欢这最后一磅012---In fact, I kind of like the last pound.
别让我做下终生遗憾的事012---So don't make me do anything that I'll regret.
你打算怎样啊  肥仔012---Ha, oh, what you gonna do, fat boy, huh? Ha, ha.
怎样012---What? Heh.
没事  我只是在想你精力过人好厉害012---Nothing. Except tell you, uh, it's wonderful how much energy you have.
谢谢012---Well, thanks.
尤其是你这阵子一直都找不到工作…012---Especially considering how tough it's been for you to find work.
你知道的012---Well, you know. Heh.
是啊  我是说…012---You know, I mean...
你不能告诉你爸妈你被开除  因为他们会很失望012---...you can't tell your parents you were fired, because they'd be disappointed.
哦-呵012---Uh-huh.
尤其你又没有男朋友  可以借肩膀让你哭012---It's not as if you have a boyfriend's shoulder to cry on.
是没错  不过我…  我是说…012---Well, no. But I...  I mean...
换成是我  我一定每天都没精神起床…012---...if it were me, I'd have difficulty getting out of bed at all.
我试着保持乐观心态012---You know, I try to stay positive.
所以012---So you?
你还想去跑步吗012---You feel like going for a run?
还好012---All right.
你不用勉强  你可以在这里睡个午觉012---Because you don't have to. You could just take a nap right here.
好吧012---Okay.
就睡一下下    好的012---Just for a little while. Okay.
罗斯吻了我  不会吧012---Ross kissed me.  No!
喔  天啊012---Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
太不可思议了012---It was unbelievable!
喔  天啊012---Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

摩妮卡  你去拿酒  把电话拔掉012---Monica, get the wine and unplug the phone.
好  瑞秋012---Okay.  Rachel.
结局好吗  还是我们要准备卫生纸012---Does this end well or do we need to get tissues?
超完美的结局012---Oh, it ended very well. Oh.
等我来再开始   等我来再开始012---Do not start without me! Do not start without me!

刚开始真的很急迫  然后012---Well, at first it was really intense, you know? And then...
天啊  后来我们就融化在一起012---Oh, God. And then we just sort of sunk into it.
好  他是抱着你的吗  还是把手放在你背后012---Oh... So, okay, was he holding you? Or were his hands on your back?
不  事实上  刚开始他手放在我腰上012---No, actually, ahem, first they started out on my waist...
然后游移上来到我的头发012---...and then they slid up and then they were in my hair.
噢   噢012---Oh. Oh.
还有  呃012---And, uh...

摩克力012---Mockolate.
什么  摩克力  巧克力的人工替代品012---I'm sorry? Mockolate.

我们认为摩克力比巧克力更好吃012---Yeah, we think that Mockolate is even better than chocolate.
好的012---All right. Ha, ha.
恩012---Mm.
对吧012---Yeah. Ha-ha-ha.
我喜欢它碎掉的感觉012---I love how it crumbles.
那是巧克力不会有的  是啊012---You see, chocolate doesn't do that. Ha-ha-ha. No, ma'am.
我们很快就能得到食品认证012---Anyhoo, we should be getting our FDA approval any day now.
哈哈哈012---RASTATTER: Ha-ha-ha.
希望赶得上感恩节前上市012---Hopefully, in time for Thanksgiving. Mm.
我们是这么想的  巧克力垄断了…012---See, the way we look at it, chocolate dominates...
主要的年节市场  比如说复活节  圣诞节012---...your major food-preparation holidays. Easter, Christmas, what have you.
但我们相信只要有适当行销012---Mm-hm.But we think given the right marketing...
我们可以让感恩节  变成摩克力的节日012---...we can make Thanksgiving the Mockolate holiday.
哇012---Wow.
你不吞下去吗012---Aren't you gonna swallow that? Ha, ha.

这个  不管怎么  恩012---Well, anyhoo, um...
总之  我们想找个能创作感恩节食谱的大厨012---...we're looking for chefs who can create Thanksgiving-themed recipes.
你有兴趣吗012---You interested?
当…012---Abso...

我喜欢创作食谱  也喜欢感恩节  现在…012---See, I love creating new recipes, I love Thanksgiving, and, well, now...
我还爱上摩克力012---...I love Mockolate.
真的012---Really? Mm.
尤其是那余味  我敢说…012---Especially that aftertaste. You know, I tell you...
可以撑到圣诞节012---...that'll last you till Christmas.
摩克力慕思如何012---How about Mockolate mousse?
感觉…012---It's not...
不像感恩节012---...very Thanksgiving-y.

很遗憾没有012---No, I'm sorry.
他为何没打电话012---Why didn't he call?
他要跟茱莉一起  对吧012---He's gonna stay with Julie.
他会选择她而她会说012---He's gonna stay with her and she'll be:
〝嗨  我是茱莉  罗斯选择我012---"Hi, I'm Julie. Ross picked me.
我们会结婚生子一起老死〞012---We'll get married and have lots of kids and dig up stuff together!"
我无意冒犯  但听起来一点都不像她012---No offense, but that sounds nothing like her.
我不知道该怎么办  我该怎么办  这真是个梦魇012---I don't know what I'll do. What am I gonna do? This is like a complete nightmare!
我知道这一定很难 〝不要啊 有两个女人爱我012---Oh, I know. This must be so hard. "Oh, no! Two women love me!
她们两个都很漂亮又性感 我的钱包太小装不下钱012---They're both gorgeous and sexy, my wallet's too small for my 50s...
我的钻石鞋也太紧了〞012---...and my diamond shoes are too tight!"
我想到了  罗斯…  别碰我的电脑  别碰电脑012---Hey, here's a thought, Ross... - Don't ever touch the computer.
罗斯  你听着  我有两个字送给你012---Ross, listen. I got two words for you:
三人行012---Threesome.

不能用写的吗012---Can't we just use a pen?
不行  原始人012---No, Amish boy.
我们先从缺点开始  那比较好玩012---Let's start with the cons because they're more fun.
先说瑞秋吧012---Ha-ha-ha. Rachel first.
不知道012---I don't know.
我觉得…012---I mean...
好吧  我想你可以说她有时候有点大小姐012---All right, I guess you can say she's a little spoiled sometimes.
没错012---You could say that.
耶012---Yeah.
有时候她还有点三八012---I guess, you know, sometimes she's a little ditzy, you know?
有时候她也太爱漂亮了012---And I've seen her be a little too into her looks.
茱莉和我有很多共同点012---Uh. Oh, and Julie and I have a lot in common...
因为我们都是古生物学家012---...because we're both paleontologists, right?
瑞秋只是个服务生012---But Rachel's just a waitress.
服务生012---Waitress.
了解  你们想玩《毁灭战士》吗012---Got it. You guys wanna play "Doom"?

尼德大叫〝喔  你看〞012---'Oh, look! ' cried Ned.
然后他进入天国  结束〞012---And then the kingdom was his forever. The end!"
就这样  你只写这样  你是世界上最糟糕的作家012---That's it? That's all you wrote? You're the worst writer in the world!
这不好玩012---This isn't funny anymore.
那纸上一定写了我什么  我要看012---There's something about me on that piece of paper, and I want to see it.
不  你不行012---No, you don't.

〝太爱漂亮〞012---Ahem. "Too into her looks"?
〝大小姐〞012---"Spoiled"?
是〝有点大小姐〞 那个白痴少打了〝有一点〞012---A little spoiled. He was supposed to type "little," the idiot!
〝只是个服务生〞012---"Just a waitress"?
那是…012---Now, that was, uh...
我是说  相对于…012---I mean, as opposed to, uh...

〝她不是瑞球〞012---"She's not Rachem"?
〝瑞球〞是什么东西012---No...What the hell's a Rachem?
是古生物学家会用的蠢字眼012---No, no... Is that some stupid paleontology word...
而我没听过  因为我只是个服务生012---...that I wouldn't know because I'm just a waitress?
瑞秋  别这样012---No. Rach, come on! Rach...
瑞秋  不012---Rach! Rach! No, no!
那写的是〝她不是瑞秋〞 她不是…012---It's "She's not Rachel"! She's not...
瑞秋012---Rachel?
我的日记  太聪明了012---My diary. My diary! That's brilliant!
如果我说是日记的话  她就不会要我念了012---If I'd said it was my diary, she wouldn't have made me read it.
那倒是真的  你是很好的事后诸葛012---No, that's true. You'd be a great person to have around the day after an emergency.
我不敢相信罗斯会列这种清单012---I cannot believe Ross even made this list.
就是说啊  真是个白痴012---I know.  What a dinkus!
别再骂他了  那是钱德的主意012---Hey, cut him some slack. It was Chandler's idea.
什么  什么012---What?  What?
很好  我就是在等这一刻012---Oh, good. I was hoping that would come up.
那是你的主意  你在想什么012---This was your idea? What?

瑞秋012---Rach! Whoa...
瑞秋012---Rach!
打开  好吗012---Hey! Uh, open up! Please?
你按铃没人应门  那就表示〝滚蛋〞…012---When somebody does not buzz you in, Ross, that means, "Go away."
而不是〝爬救生梯上来〞012---That doesn't mean, "Climb up the fire escape."
我要告诉你  你的优点012---I just want to read you something, your "Pro List."
没兴趣012---Not interested.
好…012---Okay, okay.
〝第一，你看益智节目时哭的模样012---"Number one: The way you cry at game shows. Aw.
第二，你对朋友超好的012---Number two: How much you love your friends.

第四，你能勇敢的展开新生活012---Number four: How brave you are for starting your life over.
第五，你对小班超好的012---Number five: How great you are with Ben.
第六，你的味道〞012---Number six: The way you smell."
罗斯  你在干嘛012---What are you doing?
乔伊  你可以把窗打开吗012---Joey, you wanna open the window?
好啊012---Oh, yeah.
你在外面干嘛  我  我…012---What are you doing out there? I'm, um...
你一定冻坏了 你知道你需要什么吗012---My gosh, you must be freezing. You know what you need?
来杯热腾腾的摩克力如何012---How about a nice, steaming cup of hot Mockolate?
瑞秋  拜托  请开门012---Rach, come on, open up.
瑞秋  拜托  你得给我一个机会012---Rach, come on. Come on. You gotta give me another chance.
不要012---No.
不要  没有错012---No?  That's what I said.
或许我们该走了012---Maybe we should go.
不  不需要  我们讲完了012---No, you don't have to go. We're done talking.
我了解你一定…012---Rach, come on. I know how you must...
不  你不懂  罗斯012---No, you don't, Ross.
想像你自己最糟糕的缺点012---Imagine the worst things you think about yourself.
你会有何感受  如果你最信任的人…012---Now, how would you feel if the one person that you trusted the most in the world...
不仅把它们列出来012---...not only thinks them too...
还以它们做为不跟你在一起的原因012---...but actually uses them as reasons not to be with you.
但我想跟你在一起  尽管你有那些缺点012---No, but see, I wanna be with you in spite of all those things.
你还真伟大  罗斯  我说  别走012---Oh. Well, that's mighty big of you, Ross.
我说  别走012---I said, don't go!
你知道吗012---You know what?
如果今天是你列单子  不管你在单子上写些什么012---If things were the other way around, there is nothing you could put on a list...

将外套  毛衣 裤子跟衬衫  放到卧室里012---Put your coats, sweaters, pants and shirts in the bedroom.
我在冒汗  所以看不出来012---It's hard to tell because I'm sweating...
但我完全遵照瓶上指示的用量使用发胶012---...but I use exactly what the gel bottle says.
像豆子一样大的份量而已  那怎么会太多呢012---An amount about the size of a pea. How can that be too much?
冰块012---Ice?
冰块  谁要冰块  拿张纸巾012---Ice? Ice squares anyone? Take a napkin.
好吧012---All right.
摩妮卡012---Monica. Monica!
摩妮卡  你的客人变成肉干了012---Monica, your guests are turning into jerky.
真的吗  我觉得蛮舒服的012---Really? I'm perfectly comfortable.

你说你们要办派对012---You said there was a party.
对012---Oh, yeah.
欢迎光临我们的三温暖012---Well, hey, welcome to our sauna.
很热吗  我从来不觉得热012---Uh, is it hot? My body always stays cool.
或许是因为我的皮很厚012---Probably because I have so much skin.
嘿  起司012---Hey, cheese!
这是个机会  摩妮卡  给他现金012---Here's the chance. Monica, give him cash.
瑞秋 把你的耳环送给他  想想办法  什么都可以012---Rachel, give him your earrings. Something. Anything!
不  我不会屈服012---No, I will not cave.
我支持摩妮卡012---I'm with Mon.
好吧  你说我不懂得把握当下012---All right. You know how you say I never seize the day?
虽然他是你们的管理员  我要把握机会012---Even though he's your super, I'm seizing.
崔格先生012---Mr. Treeger?
这是五十块  圣诞快乐012---Here is 50 bucks. Merry Christmas.
噢  哇噢012---Oh, wow.
我没帮你准备礼物012---I didn't get you anything.
给你五块012---Here's five back.
不  那是你的圣诞节红包012---No, that's your Christmas tip.
喔  你能顺便修一下暖气吗012---Oh, do you think there's a chance you can fix that radiator now?
不行  我跟女孩们说过012---No can do. Like I told the girl...
星期二才能拿到开关零件012---...I can't get a knob until Tuesday.
罗斯  什么012---Ross? Yeah?
看来他很僵硬哦012---He's playing baseball.
你要说强硬吗012---You mean hardball?
都一样012---Whatever.
你要怎么办012---What you gonna do?
对不起  我要把握机会012---Excuse me. I'm seizing.
崔格先生012---Mr. Treeger?
这是另一张五十块012---Here's another 50.
光明节快乐012---Happy Hanukkah.
这能帮助你快点拿到开关零件吗012---Will, uh, this help with the knob-getting?
不行012---No.
商店星期二才会开门012---The place is not open till Tuesday.
我发音有问题吗012---Am I not saying it right?
你真的喜欢我的饼干012---So you really did like my cookies?
是呀 那好温暖哦  真的表示你的关心012---Oh, yeah, they were so personal. It really showed you cared.
把握得好012---Nice seizing...
发胶兄012---...gel boy.
好吧012---So, uh...
这是槲寄生吗012---Is this, uh, mistletoe?
不  那是…012---No, uh, that...
那是罗勒 叫九层塔012---That is basil.
噢   耶012---Oh.  Yeah.
如果那是槲寄生  我可以吻你012---If it was mistletoe, I was gonna kiss you.
不  那是罗勒012---No, it's still basil.
好吧012---Okay.
你跑到哪里了  信箱012---How far did you get?  Mailbox.
好吧  我们有进步了012---All right, we're getting closer.  Uh-huh.
菲比  到底发生了什么事012---What's going on?
这真的是一团糟012---It's just, like, a whole mess of stuff.
昨天我爸是著名的缅甸树医生012---Like yesterday, my dad was this famous Burma tree-surgeon guy.
现在他是药剂师012---And, you know, now he's, uh, a pharmacist guy and...
或许他是很酷的药剂师012---Well, maybe he's this really cool pharmacist guy.
或许是啊  我要去敲门012---Yeah, maybe. And I'll knock on the door...
他会拥抱我  我就有爸爸了012---...and he'll hug me, and I'll have a dad.
我会去他的药房  大家都会对我好012---I'll go to his pharmacy and everyone will be nice to me...
因为我是法兰克的女儿012---...because, you know, I'm Frank's daughter.
那为什么你不去敲门呢012---So why not go knock?
因为如果他不是个好爸爸呢012---Because, I mean, what if he's not this great dad guy?
如果他还是那个抛弃我妈跟我们的混蛋呢012---What if he's still the dirtbag who ran out on my mom and us?
对012---Yeah.Hmm.
你们知道吗012---You know what?
这星期我已经失去一个假爸爸012---I've already lost a fake dad this week.
我想我还没准备好要失去真爸爸012---I don't think I'm ready to lose a real one.
菲比  没关系的  今天你跨出一大步012---Pheebs, that's okay. You took a big step today.
是吗  对012---Yeah? Yeah.
有一天当你准备好后  你会跨过灌木丛012---Someday, when you're ready, you'll make it past the hedges.
那个时候他会有幸得到你012---And when you do, he'll be lucky to have you.
你们太棒了012---You guys.
抱歉你们来不及去买东西了012---Sorry about your shopping.
没关系  我们会想出办法的012---CHANDLER: Oh, that's okay. We'll figure something out.
我知道你不打算进去012---I know you're not going in there...
你觉得我能去跟他借厕所吗012---...but do you think it'd be all right if I went in and used his bathroom?
没关系  算了012---That's fine, never mind.
很酷  下雪了012---Cool, snow!
就跟一大张画布一样012---Kind of like a blank canvas.
天啊  真的好热012---Ho-ho-ho-holy crap, is it hot in here!
我可以关掉暖气吗012---You mind if I turn the heat down?
我们该早点想到那一点的012---We could have used that kind of thinking earlier!
菲比  怎么样012---So, Pheebs, how did it go?
我没办法进去012---Oh, ahem, I couldn't go in.
甜心  我很遗憾  你还好吧012---Honey, I'm sorry.  Are you okay?
没事  因为我知道他在那里012---Yeah, it's okay, because I know he's there.
现在那就够了012---So that's enough for now.
已经过了午夜  祝大家圣诞快乐012---Hey, it's after midnight! Merry Christmas, everyone!
对  圣诞快乐012---Oh, right! Merry Christmas!
嘿  摩妮卡  开关坏了012---The knob was broken...
我就从下面把暖气整个关掉  希望你不介意012---...so I turned it off from underneath. I hope that's all right.
瑞秋  这是给你的012---Rach, these are for you.
雨刷012---Wiper blades.
可是我没车012---I don't even have a car.
没错  有了这个新汽车芳香剂  你会以为你有012---Ha, ha. No, but with this new-car smell, you'll think you do.
好吧  菲比  轮到你了012---Okay, Pheebs, your turn.
马桶座垫纸012---Toilet-seat covers.
你们趁我去加油时买的吗012---Is that what you were doing while I was getting gas?
嗯哼  唔012---Uh-huh.Mm-hm.
你们太贴心了012---You guys!
给罗斯的礼物012---And for Ross...
爱吃甜的家伙012---...Mr. Sweet Tooth.
你们送我可乐012---You got me a cola drink?
还有柠檬口味的012---And a lemon-lime!
这太多了  我觉得我该再送你一件毛衣012---Well, this is too much. I feel like I should get you another sweater.
还有一个很有价值的…012---And last but not least...
在亲热时给你最佳保护012---They're ribbed for your pleasure.
乔伊  你可以慢一点吗012---Joey, would you slow down?
报纸不会在凌晨一点卖光的012---They're not gonna be sold out of papers at 1:00 in the morning.
我好兴奋  我从来没有被剧评过012---I'm excited. I've never gotten reviewed before.
你演的国王好棒  我超欣赏的  真的012---You were so amazing as the king. I'm really impressed. I was.
不过你知道吗012---But you know what?
你得考虑一下  下次要穿内裤012---You might wanna consider wearing underwear next time.
你坐上王位时  看得到你的…012---Because when you sat on your throne, you could kind of see your...
皇家物件012---...royal subjects.
在这里012---Here it is. Here it is.
〝唯一比没脑幼稚的导演糟的012---"The only thing worse than the mindless adolescent direction...
是乔伊·崔比亚尼对国王不熟练的诠释〞012---...was Joseph Tribbiani's disturbingly unskilled portrayal of the king."
听好  这只是一个人的主观意见012---Okay, look. That is one guy's opinion.
好吗  菲比  念你的  好012---All right? Pheebs, read yours. - Okay.
〝唯一比没脑幼稚的导演糟的〞012---"The only thing worse than the mindless, adolescent direction..."
谁有别的报纸012---Does anybody have one from a different paper?
罗斯  念你的012---Ross, read yours.
我不要012---I don't want to.
乔伊  他们不晓得自己在说什么012---Joey, honey, they don't know what they're talking about.
也许他们知道012---Maybe they do.
我在这行已经十年了  还一无所成012---I've been doing this 10 years and I haven't gotten anywhere.
一定有原因的012---There's gotta be a reason.
别这样  你还是在付出阶段012---Come on, man, you're just, uh, paying your dues.
不是  真的是太困难了012---No, no, no. It's too hard.
真不值得  我不干了012---It's not worth it. I quit.
什么  你疯了012---What? That's crazy.
等等  等等012---Wait, wait one minute. Wait a minute.
包你听了会回心转意的012---I believe this will change your mind.
〝凭着平凡的剧本  乔伊·崔比亚尼成功地达到全新水平的…〞012---"In a mediocre play, Joseph Tribbiani was able to achieve brilliant new levels of..."
153页继续012---Continued on page 153.
〝烂透了〞012---"...sucking."

说真的  我不需要你…012---Hey, no, seriously. I don't need you to...
好耶  还是有用  很好012---All right, it still works.Okay.
我走之前  还有谁需要被举起来的012---Now, before I go, does anybody else need to be picked up?
我还是走吧012---I'm still gonna go.
晚点见  宝贝012---Okay, I'll see you later, babe. Ah.

我用这个可爱的…012---I had about a mug full in this lovely...

所以那是  两瓶吗012---Okay, so that's, what? Two bottles.

好笑巴比手上永远都有一杯酒012---...I don't think I've ever seen Fun Bobby without a drink in his hand.
对啊012---PHOEBE: Yeah. Ooh, ooh, yeah, you know?
你们有注意到  他故事的开始总是012---Did you notice how he always starts his stories with, um:
〝我当时好醉〞或是 〝我们都喝醉了〞012---"Okay, I was so wasted," or, "Oh, we were so bombed."
又或是〝我醒来时发现我在康州的一个垃圾箱里〞012---Or, um, "So I wake up and I'm in this Dumpster in Connecticut."
摩妮卡  你们约会时他有没有喝过酒012---Monica, have you ever been with him when he wasn't drinking?
只是恰巧而已  我们去的地方都会喝酒的012---Well, we just happen to go to a lot of places where you might drink.
去个品酒会  总不能不喝吧012---I mean, how do you go to a wine-tasting without having a drink?

你知道吗  最近你把很多东西都变爱尔兰式的了012---You know, it seems like you've been making an awful lot of stuff Irish lately.
我也可以做比利时式的  但松饼很难塞进酒瓶子里012---I would make them Belgian, but the waffles are hard to get into that flask.
巴比012---Bobby.
好吧012---Yeah, okay.
也许这不关我的事  也许是  我不知道012---Look, maybe this is none of my business, or maybe it is, I don't know.
我有点担心你012---But, um, I'm kind of worried about you.
这不是第一次有人和我提这件事012---Okay, look, this isn't the first time somebody said something to me about this.
我总是找藉口 像〝我只是交际一下〞012---But, I don't know, I always made excuses, like "I'm just a social drinker."
或〝今天是国旗日！〞012---Or "Hey, come on, it's Flag Day."
你想说什么012---So, what are you saying now?
我想说的是…012---I guess I'm saying...

不会吧012---Oh, no.
我想这好像有点苦乐参半…012---Okay, I guess this is gonna seem bittersweet now...
是乔伊  就是他012---...but Joey, that's who.
真的  太好了012---Oh, yay! Really?
我经纪人才打来  叫我去《我们的日子》试镜012---My agent just called me with an audition for Days of our Lives.

我再也不会对他有什么012---I'm not really anything at him anymore.
你在讲什么  我不知道012---What are you talking about? I don't know.
不管我以前怎么感觉  我…现在不了012---Whatever I was feeling, I'm... not.
你们就只差那一步012---But you guys came so close.
我知道  很抱歉  伙计们  你们得习惯…012---Oh, I know. I'm sorry, you guys. You're gonna have to get used to the fact...
我不再和罗斯约会012---...that I will not be dating Ross.

对  她很不错012---Yeah, yeah, she's great.
我感觉她好像对我有那么一点点意思012---But I kind of got the feeling that she was sort of coming on to me.
我肯定拿得到那个角色的  如果我  你也知道的012---And I definitely would get the part if I were to, you know...
看我是否要派我的“小将军”出马012---lf I would have sent the little general in. Oh.

什么意思012---What do you mean?
你看不出来  看到什么012---Do you not see it? See what?
我真不知道她看上那呆子哪一点012---I don't know what she sees in that goober.
他需要…不知道012---It takes him, what? Like, I don't know, uh...
一个礼拜来讲完一句话012---...hello, a week to get out a sentence?
很讨厌  对吧012---Yeah, it's annoying, isn't it?
对啊012---Yeah.
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
哇  哇012---Whoa, whoa.
我猜你是没拿到那个角色…012---I'm guessing you didn't get the part...
还是意大利打电话来说它饿了012---...or, uh, Italy called and said it was hungry?
那角色是我的  如果我想要的话012---Well, the part's mine if I want it.
我的天012---Oh, my God.
没错  如果我愿意和选角的女士上床的话012---Yeah. If I'm willing to sleep with the casting lady.

这十年来我一直在等像这样的机会  钱德  十年耶012---Ten years I've been waiting for a break like this, Chandler. Ten years.
我是说“我们的日子”那真的会在电视上播出012---I mean, Days of our Lives. That's actually on television.
你想怎么做012---So, what are you gonna do?
我想我可以和她上床  但是…012---I guess I could sleep with her. I mean...
我怎么能那样做012---How can I do that?
我有本立体书  教我关于性的一切012---Well, I've got a pop-up book that told me everything I needed to know.
我从来没为了一个角色跟人睡过012---I've never slept with someone for a part.
那她是…012---Well, is she...?
抱歉012---Sorry.
她好看吗  是的012---Is she good-looking? Yeah.
她很迷人  如果我在哪个夜店遇上她…012---She's totally good-looking. I mean, if I met her in a bar or something...
我会想给她买早餐012---...I'd be buying her breakfast.
你知道  跟她上床之后012---You know, after having slept with her.
也许这没什么大不了的012---You know, maybe this isn't such a big deal.
依我看  你不但得到一份好工作  还可以跟她上床012---I mean, the way that I see it is, you get a great job and you get to have sex.
你知道  也许再加上一棵树跟胖子就像圣诞树了012---You know? Throw in a tree and a fat guy, and you've got Christmas.
我只是不希望那样得到这份工作  你知道吗012---I just... I just don't think that I want it that way though, you know?
我是说  如果有一天我成名了012---I mean, let's say I do make it, all right?
我会总怀疑那到底是因为我的才华012---I'm always gonna look back and wonder if it was because of my talent...
还是因为  你知道的  我的“小将军”。012---...or because of, you know, the little general.
你以前不是叫它“小少校”的吗012---Didn't you used to call it the little major?
是啊  但在上过丹妮丝·帝马可后  我给它升级了012---Yeah, but after Denise DeMarco, I had to promote it.
两位要不要来一杯酒吗012---Can I get you something from the bar?
好  我要来一杯012---Yes, I would like something.
不要  谢谢012---No. No, thank you.
如果你想喝  我没问题  我得习惯012---No, if you want a drink, it's okay with me. I've gotta get used to it.
不要  说真的  我会觉得不对劲012---No, no, really. I wouldn't feel right about it.
来杯水好了  谢谢012---Just some water, please.
我冰箱的灯熄了  威士忌加冰块跟柠檬皮012---So the light went out in my refrigerator.Scotch on the rocks with a twist.

除非直九的“白缎之夜”是“杜迪蓝调”唱的012---Unless of course 9 Down, "Nights in White Satin" was sung by the Doody Blues.
你没看懂吗  你真的没看懂012---You don't see it? You actually don't see it?
什么事  甜心  你在和罗斯交往012---What? Okay, honey, you're dating Ross.

史帝夫  大夫012---Steve, sleeve.
好没有人名字叫大夫012---Okay, no one is named sleeve.

除了他们的名字相似外  我很抱歉  我看不到你看到的012---Other than their names being similar, I'm sorry, I do not see what you're seeing.
只是让你知道  是行家  不是老手012---For your information, it's a card sharp, not a card shark.

你可以试  但你不会成功的012---You could try, but you would not be successful.
好  我先去倒杯咖啡  在你们开始互戳眼睛前012---Okay, I'm gonna get some more coffee before the pinching and eye-poking begins.
我知道你的问题是什么了  你知道012---I know what your problem is. Oh, you do, do you?
你在吃醋012---Mm-hm. You're jealous.
吃什么醋012---Uh, of what?
你嫉妒我是真正的医生012---You're jealous because I'm a real doctor.
你是牙龈医生012---Hey, you're a doctor of gums.

怎么了  巴比又开始喝酒012---What's going on? Is, uh, Bobby drinking again?
这不是给他的  是我要喝的012---Oh, no, this is not for him. This is for me.
这样  他会很清醒  我也会觉得他的鞋带故事有趣多了012---That way, he's still sober, but I find his stories about shoelaces more amusing.
老天  他连敲门都这么无聊012---Ugh, God. Even his knock is boring.
我马上就准备好了  我能和你谈一下吗012---Hi. I'll be ready in just a second. Uh, could I talk to you a minute?

有时候我喜欢拿这种东西  假装我是个巨人012---Sometimes I like to hold stuff like this and pretend I'm a giant.

你不知道他们感情不好  不知道012---You had no idea?  None.
他们不常吵架012---They didn't fight?
才不会  他们根本不说话012---No, they didn't even talk to each other.
我怎么会知道他们之间有问题啊012---How was I suppose to know they were having problems?
在我的年代  是不能离婚的012---You know, in my day, divorce was not an option.

我想我已经长大了  就不用担心这个问题012---I figured as an adult, I wouldn't have to worry about it.
你可以把这件事当做是种赞美吗012---Can't you look at this as flattering?
她这么做是因为想跟你一样012---She just wants to be like you.
她不能模仿我的发型就好了吗012---Well, couldn't she have just copied my haircut?
我父母离婚时  他们要我去看心理医师012---When my parents divorced, they sent me to a shrink...
她跟我说孩子都会责怪自己012---...and she told me that kids blame themselves.

不用了  我花了整个早上才站起来的012---No, I spent most of my morning trying to stand up.
我能为你做些什么  亲爱的012---What can I do for you, my dear?

你看这个012---Ha, ha. Look at this.
这些是三年前的万圣节012---These are all Halloween, three years ago.

他从办公室直接过去012---He came straight from the office?
不  那是他的变装服012---Oh, no. That was his costume.
他其实是牙齿矫正医师  但是他装扮成一般的牙医012---See, he's actually an orthodontist, but he came as a regular dentist.
两位012---Um, you guys?
记得我之前说  谢谢  我不需要你们帮忙012---Remember when I said that I don't need your help?

你知道吗  我不能跟你谈这件事了012---You know what? I cannot have this conversation with you.
好啦012---All right.
你还没告诉爸爸  就来先跟我丢这个炸弹012---You come here and drop this bomb on me before you even tell Daddy.
难道你要我祝福你  要我说服你不要这样012---Do you want my blessing? Want me to talk you out of it?
那你到底想怎样012---Then what do you want?
我想只有你会了解012---I guess I figured you would understand.
为什么我会了解012---Why on earth would I understand this?
你没嫁给你的巴瑞  女儿012---You didn't marry your Barry, honey.

我在想  你有没有考虑过为孩子们演唱012---And I was thinking, have you thought about playing your songs for kids?
我是很想有小孩…012---Oh, I would love to have kids...
听我演唱我为他们写的歌012---...hear me play the songs that I will write for them.
晚餐吃什么012---What do you wanna do for dinner?
我们可以留在家自己煮012---We could stay in and cook for ourselves.
哈罗  我是艾瑞卡012---Hello. It's Erika.
天啊  是那个跟踪者012---Oh, my God. The stalker!
不用了  门没关012---Never mind. It's open.
啊  啊012---Aah! Aah!
对  用平底锅打她是个好主意012---Yes, hitting her with a frying pan is a good idea.
不过  我们应该想点别的  以防她不是卡通人物012---We might wanna have a backup plan, though, just in case she isn't a cartoon.
我们快逃离这里吧012---Let's get out of here!
竟然挑这个时候不在家012---The one time they're not home!
好  好012---Okay. Okay.
我们要走  在楼梯上碰到的时候…012---We'll leave. When we pass her...
…她不会知道是我  因为我们没有见过啊012---...she won't know me, because we never met!
只有广播明星能这样摆脱跟踪者012---That's how radio stars escape stalkers!
她来了012---She's coming!
是我012---It's me. Aah!
完了  我们就这样死的012---Uh, this is it. This is how we're gonna die.
准备好没  等一下012---You ready?  Wait, wait, wait!
嗨012---Hi.
艾瑞卡012---Erika!
盖勒先生  是  嗨012---Mr. Geller?  Yes, hi.
嗨  我是狄恩·利浦森  动物园园长012---Hi. Dean Lipson, zoo administrator.
听说你有个问题012---I was told you had a question.
我找不到去年捐给动物园的猴子012---I, uh... I can't find the monkey I donated last year. He's a capuchin...
一只叫马塞尔的卷尾猴012---...answers to the name Marcel?
恐怕我得告诉你坏消息012---Ah. I'm afraid I have some bad news.
马塞尔已经过世了012---Marcel has passed on.
天啊  怎么了012---Oh, my God. What happened?
他生了病  病情越来越恶化…012---Well, he got sick, and then he got sicker...
后来状况有一点好转012---...and then he got a little better.
可是最后他还是死了012---But then he died.
我真是不敢相信012---I can't believe this!
我很遗憾  盖勒先生  俗话说012---I'm sorry, Mr. Geller. But you know, there's an old saying:
〝猴子难免一死〞012---"Sometimes monkeys die."
不是很好的俗语012---It's not a great saying...
但用在今天却很贴切012---...but it certainly is fitting today.
你们应该打电话通知我的  抱歉012---Someone should've called me. I'm sorry.
我知道这样无法挽回他的生命012---Look, I know this can't bring him back...
不过这是我们的一点心意012---...but here, it's just a gesture.
动物园礼券012---Zoo dollars?
是啊  你可以参观4点的小鸟秀  金刚鹦鹉戴帽子表演012---Yes, and come see the bird show at 4. The macaws wear hats.
如果你的猴子没死就更好了012---Well, it's a lot cuter if your monkey hasn't just died.
噢012---Ooh.
我知道012---I know.
真不敢相信  乔伊竟然和影迷跟踪者吃午饭012---I can't believe Joey's having lunch with his stalker.
她长得怎么样012---What is she like?
记得《危情十日》里的凯西·贝兹吗012---Well, you remember Kathy Bates in Misery? Mm-hm.
她跟她长的完全相反012---Well, she looks the exact opposite of that.
她没疯吗012---And she's not crazy?
不是  她是个超级大疯子012---Oh, no, no. She's a total wack job.
她认为乔伊就是德瑞克·雷莫瑞医生012---Yeah. She thinks that Joey is actually Dr. Drake Ramoray.
我的天啊012---Oh, my God!
这样他还跟她约会012---Oh. And he's going out with her?
他不能这么做的012---He cannot pursue this.
就因为这个女人以为她可以在她的客厅魔盒里面看到乔伊…012---Just because this woman thinks she can see Joey through the magical box...
并不表示她就不是人012---...in her living room doesn't mean she's not a person.
她难道没有权利去爱  不能追求幸福吗012---Does she not deserve happiness? Does she not deserve love?
你们干嘛瞪我啊  是他自己要去跟疯子约会的012---What are you looking at me for? He's the one who wants to boff the maniac.
你还好吧012---Are you okay?
不好  我很紧张012---No, uh-uh. I'm just nervous.
如果我想像他们只穿着内衣裤012---Maybe if I just picture them all in their underwear...
这样不太好  上个家伙就是那样被开除的012---That's not a good idea. That's the reason the last guy got fired.
噢012---Oh.
好012---Yeah.
我只是习惯在大人面前表演012---I'm used to playing for grownups.
大人会边喝咖啡  边忙着自己的事情012---Grownups drink their coffee and do their grownup thing, you know.
可是小孩子012---And kids...
会认真听表演012---...listen.
这样我的责任太大了012---It's just a huge responsibility.
怎么样012---What?
你要亲我吗012---Are you gonna kiss me?
我是有这个打算012---I was thinking about it.
好012---Okay.
好了  开始表演了012---Yeah, okay. Alrighty. Let's play some tunes!

她会买给你一辆火车跟一辆闪亮脚踏车012---She bought you a train And a bright shiny bike
可是最近她一直没来吃晚饭012---But lately she hasn't Been coming to dinner
你上次看到她时  她瘦了好多012---And last time you saw her She looked so much thinner
爸爸跟妈妈说  她搬去秘鲁012---Now your mom and your dad said She moved to Peru
其实她已经死了  有一天你也会死012---But the truth is she died And someday you will too
啦啦啦啦啦啦  啦啦啦啦啦啦  啦啦啦啦啦啦012---La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la
德瑞克  这一切真的很棒  对吧  对啊012---Oh, Drake, isn't it amazing?  Yeah, it is.
怎么了012---What?
我们现在坐在这里吃饭012---Well, here we sit, devil-may-care...
很难想像你刚才还在帮席蒙接脊椎呢012---...and just a little while ago you were reattaching Simone's spinal cord.
对  那个手术很困难012---Yeah, that was a tricky one.
事实上012---In reality...
这样的手术要花10小时  不过他们只播出2分钟012---...that operation takes over 10 hours, but they only showed it for two minutes.
他们是谁012---Who's "they"?
没什么啦012---No one.
德瑞克  你好有才华喔  让我看看你的手012---Oh, Drake, you are so talented. Let me see those hands.
这双手真是美丽012---Oh, these hands, these beautiful hands. Ha, ha.
我好想把这双手给吃了012---Ha, ha. Oh, I could just eat them.
可是我不会012---But I won't.Ha, ha.
很好  不然我的手表会掉下来012---Good. Otherwise my watch would fall off.
我是说真的012---No, seriously.
这双手012---These hands...
这双神奇 拯救生命的手012---...these miracle, magical, life-giving hands.
我只想接近它们  碰触它们  甚至舔一下012---Oh, just to be near them, touch them, maybe even lick one?
好吧  只舔一只喔012---All right. Ha, ha. Just one. Ha-ha-ha.
哇噢012---Wow.
你还真厉害012---You're good at that.
天啊  来个人  他噎到了012---Oh, my God! Someone! He's choking!

他还活着012---It's alive.
我不懂  你为什么不帮那个人012---I don't understand. Why didn't you help that man?
因为我是神经外科医生…012---Uh, because, uh, I'm a neurosurgeon...
而他的状况显然是…012---...and that was clearly a case of, uh, uh...
〝食物噎到症〞012---..."foodal chokage."
你知道…012---You know.
我有事得跟你说…012---I gotta tell you something... No, no, no.
不  你什么都不用跟我说012---You don't have to tell me anything.

可是…  我能接近你就很开心了012---That's... I should be happy to be near you.
嘿  我…012---Hey, I...

就像跳完舞之后也会说声〝嘿〞012---Like at the end of a dance. Hey!

你相信动物园的说法吗012---You believe everything the zoo tells you?
可是动物园只跟我说这些啊012---Uh, that's the only thing the zoo's ever told me.
他们当然会这样说  因为不希望坏消息传开来012---Of course they'll say he's dead. They don't want the bad publicity.

我之所以知道是因为…012---And I know this...
他假装自己是德瑞克  来骗我上床012---...because he pretended to be Drake to sleep with me!
他还跟我说  他会跟我私奔012---And then he told me he would run away with me.

叫你去的话说不定最后会被你喝掉012---If I ask you to, you'll end up drinking it yourself.

突然她转过来对我说012---...and then she turns to me and says:
〝你想在电梯里做吗〞012---"Did you ever want to do it in an elevator?"
你说了什么012---What did you say?
我想我当时说的是…012---I believe my exact words were:
你怎么知道要不要在电梯里做012---How do you know if you wanna do that?
你就是会知道012---Oh, you just know.

你以为我在电视上看不到你吗012---Do you think I can't see you in the TV set?

通常我是不会答应的012---Normally, I would not do it.
是吗012---Yeah?
那为什么会为我破例012---What made you make the exception for me?
因为瑞秋跟我说012---Rachel told me, uh...
你非常想跟我和茱儿·巴莉摩来个三人行012---...you were dying to have a threesome with me and, uh, Drew Barrymore.
对了  茱儿有些原则…012---By the way, Drew has some ground rules and...

哦  也就等于是 〝上床〞去012---Well, pretty much get down tonight.

何不直接找爸爸妈妈借012---Oh. Then why don't you borrow it from Mom and Dad?
反正你在他们面前  已经充满罪恶感与压力了012---You feel guilty and tense around them already.

我高中时的泳装  我当年比较肿一点012---That's my bathing suit from high school. I was a little bigger then.
我还以为这是以前下雨时  用来遮盖康乃迪克州的东西012---Oh, I thought that's what they used to cover Connecticut when it rains.
摩妮卡  这带子有录什么012---Hey, what's on this videotape?

你能拍到吗012---Can you get this?
哦  我的天012---Oh, my God!
你的鼻子怎么了012---What is with your nose?
我当年有鼻中膈弯曲  后来只好弄短了012---They had to reduce it because of my deviated septum.
我错了  用来遮盖康乃迪克的是这个才对012---Okay, I was wrong. That's what they use to cover Connecticut.
知道是什么吗  这是我们准备要去毕业舞会的带子012---This is us getting ready for the prom. Ah!

大家  微笑012---Everybody smile!
关掉！012---Oh, Dad, turn it off!
哪有  红灯怎么还亮着  那是代表关掉的灯012---It is off. It is not! What's with the red light?

洛伊看了《星际大战》317次012---You know, Roy saw Star Wars 317 times.
他还拿来写论文012---His name was in the paper.
奇普人呢  他怎么还没到012---Where's Chip? Why isn't he here yet?
他会来的  可以吗  吞颗镇定剂吧012---He'll be here, okay? Take a chill pill.
好了012---There.
我刚才是跟瑞秋说  洛伊碰了我的胸部012---I just told Rachel that Roy touched my boob.
我没有舞伴不能去参加  我不能  来不及了012---I can't go to the prom without a date. I can't! It's too late!
你不去的话  我也不想去012---If you're not going, then I don't want to go either.
哦  我要宰了奇普012---Oh, I'm gonna kick Chip's ass!
我有个好主意012---I have a wonderful idea.
你应该带瑞秋去参加毕业舞会012---You should take Rachel to the prom.
很怀疑呐012---Doubtful.
杰克  摄影机给我  你来跟你儿子说012---Jack, give me that. Talk to your son.

她当然愿意 你是大学生了012---JACK: Of course she would! You're a college man!
我不晓得  哦  好了啦012---I don't know. Well, come on.
你就不想试试看012---Don't you wanna find out?
我真是不敢相信  我不能参加毕业舞会了012---I can't believe I can't go to the prom!
太糟糕了012---This is so harsh!

妈  我饿了012---Mom, I'm hungry!
跟你爸爸跳012---Dance with your father.
我也许不会跳闪舞  不过我上了舞池亦非等闲之辈012---I don't know any of your flashdances, but I'm no slouch on the dance floor.

不然你不会歪着头012---...or you wouldn't do the head tilt.
歪着头012---The head tilt?
自从我离婚后  每个人跟我问好时012---Since the divorce, everybody asks how I am...
都会同情地歪着头 〝你还好吧  还可以吧〞012---...with a sympathetic head tilt. "How you doing? You okay?"

对不起  不会012---I'm sorry.  No, no.

你得出去  这是你的派对012---Get back out there. It's your party!
但他们都好无聊  一堆眼科医生012---But they're so dull. They're all ophthalmologists.
你就是眼科医生012---You're an ophthalmologist.

我不认为我是说  怎么可以  他是大人012---I don't think so. I mean, like, he's a grown-up.
所以呢  你们两个完全互相着迷012---So? You two are totally into each other.
菲比  他是我爸妈的朋友  他比我大二十岁012---He's a friend of my parents. He's like 20 years older than me.
那你不会再跟他见面012---So you're never gonna see him again?
也不能那么说012---Not never.
我约他明天帮我检查眼睛012---I'm gonna see him tomorrow at my eye appointment.
你不是刚检查过眼睛吗  对  但你知道的012---Didn't you just get your eyes checked? Yeah, but, you know, uh...
27岁的人很容易眼睛发生病变012---...27 is a dangerous eye age.
我不是说那部电影不好看  我只是说那有一点…012---I'm not saying it was a bad movie. I'm just saying it was a little...
难懂012---...hard to follow.
我说过会有字幕的012---I told you there'd be subtitles.
我知道012---I know.
我只是不想  跟你第一次约会就戴眼镜012---I just didn't want to wear my glasses on our first date.
噢012---Oh.
摩妮卡012---Monica?
我希望我吻你时  你叫的不是我妹妹的名字012---It would help when I'm kissing if you didn't shout my sister's name.
甜心  我去看一下012---Honey, I'm just checking. Oh.
摩妮卡  摩妮卡012---Ahem. Monica? Mon?

怎么了  对不起012---What?  I'm sorry.
对不起  当你的手滑到我屁股上时…012---I'm sorry. It's just, when you moved your hands down to my butt...
我只想到 〝罗斯在摸我的屁股〞012---...it was like, "Whoa, Ross' hands are on my butt!"
抱歉012---Sorry.
很好笑  为什么012---And that's funny why?
不是好笑012---Well, it's not. Uh...
我是说  抱歉  我想我很紧张012---I mean, I'm sorry. I guess I'm just nervous.
毕竟我面对的人是你012---I mean, it's you.
我们在一起了012---You know, it's us.  Mm.
我们越过那条线  这真的很重要012---I mean, we're crossing that line. It's sort of a big thing.
我知道这很重要  我只是不知道它很好笑012---Well, I know it's big. I just didn't know it was ha-ha big.
好吧012---Okay.
好  我没有摸你屁股012---Okay, my hands were nowhere near your butt.
我知道  我知道012---I know, I know, I know!
我只是在想  你刚刚摸了我的屁股012---I was thinking about when they were there the last time.
对不起  好吧  听着  我保证012---I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Okay, look! Whoa, I promise.
我准备好了  我不会再笑  把你的手放回去012---I'm good. I won't laugh anymore. Put your hands back there.
不  你看  现在我没办法了  因为012---No, see, now I can't, because, uh...
我觉得太不自然了012---...I'm feeling too self-conscious.
摸一边就好  不了012---Just one cheek.  No. Ha.
感觉没了012---The moment's gone.
我可以背对你  让你摸  那还真是浪漫012---I'll back up into your hands.  That's romantic.
摸一下  不要012---Touch it. No.

听着  你们跟女生亲热时…012---Have you ever been, you know, fooling around with a girl...
对方会笑个不停吗012---...and, uh, she started laughing?
会  但那是1982年…012---Yeah, but, uh, it was 1982...
我的瀑布发型对着她的下巴搔痒012---...and my Flock of Seagulls haircut was tickling her chin.

南方古猿不该放在那个展示区012---Australopithecus isn't supposed to be in that display.
不  不012---No, no.
不  直立猿人可以直立  南方古猿无法完全立起来012---No, Homo habilis was erect. Australopithecus was never fully erect.
或许是因为他很紧张012---Well, maybe he was nervous.
你看  我不敢相信012---Oh, look! I can't believe this!
直立猿人还不会使用工具  他们还把他跟陶壶放在一起012---Homo habilis can't use tools yet, and they've got him with clay pots?
不如给他一个微波炉算了012---Why don't they just give him a microwave? Heh.

天啊  那晚她真的喝的…012---Oh, my God, that night she got so dru...
非常激动012---Emotional.
你知道吗  她又要生了012---You know, she's having another baby.  Mm.
我以为她刚刚才生完孩子  不  亨利快满两岁了012---I thought she just had one. No, no. Henry's almost 2.

你当外公了012---Whoa. You're a grandpa.
对012---Yeah.

汤匙  你舔过后放回去012---The spoon! You licked and you put.
你舔过后放回去012---You licked and you put.
对  那又怎样012---Yeah, so?
你没发现这有多恶心吗  那等于是你用我的牙刷012---Don't you see how gross that is? It's like you using my toothbrush!
你用过我的牙刷012---You used my toothbrush?
那是因为 我用红色那根通排水孔012---Only because I used the red one to unclog the drain.
我的是红色那根012---Mine is the red one!
天啊  揭开封印  到处有鬼012---Oh, God! Can open. Worms everywhere!
我们为什么不能用同一根牙刷012---Why can't we use the same toothbrush...
却能用同一块香皂012---...but we can use the same soap?
因为香皂是香皂  那会自我清洁012---Because soap is soap. It's self-cleaning.
下次你洗澡时…012---The next time you shower...
…想想我最后洗什么  而你最先洗什么012---...think about the last thing I wash and the first thing you wash.
《老友记》 第二季 第16集: 乔伊搬家012---Friends S02E16: The One Where Joey Moves Out

是什么场合012---What's the occasion?
记得我的电视剧里那个演昏迷不醒的人吗012---You know that guy on my show that's in a coma?
他要请我吃早午餐012---He's having a brunch.
就等你了012---Ready when you are.
真不敢相信你们居然要刺青012---I can't believe you're actually getting tattoos.
打个岔  你们要刺青012---You guys are getting tattoos?
对  但你不能告诉罗斯  因为我想给他惊喜012---But you cannot tell Ross because I wanna surprise him.
好狂放  你要刺什么012---Wow, this is wild! What are you gonna get?
我要刺一朵百合012---I'm getting a lily.
纪念我妈  因为她叫百合012---For my mom, because her name's Lily.
运气真好  假如她叫丑大污点呢012---That's lucky. What if her name was Big Ugly Splotch?
你想刺在哪里  我肩膀上012---Where you getting it?  On my shoulder.
什么012---What?
什么在你肩膀上012---What's on your shoulder?
皮包012---A chip.
刺青  我要去刺青  刺青012---A tattoo. I'm getting a tattoo. A tattoo?
为什么  你为何要这么做012---Why? Why would you wanna do that?
嗨   嗨012---Hi.  Hi.
你不觉得刺青蛮酷的012---You don't think they're kind of cool?
不  抱歉  我不觉得012---No. Sorry, I don't.
为何有人要付钱请师傅  在身上留下一辈子的伤痕012---Why would anyone pay someone to scar their body for life?
假如刺得不对劲呢  菲比012---What if it doesn't come out right?
那就像老是顶着剪坏的发型012---It's like having a bad haircut all the time.
为什么大家都盯着我看012---Why is everyone staring at me?
罗斯  过来签给爸的生日卡  理查快要来了012---Sign this card for Dad. Richard will be here soon.
理查也要参加派对012---Richard's going to the party too?
他是我父母最好的朋友  他非得到场不可012---He's my parents' best friend. He has to go.
那你打算今天告诉他们你们的事吗012---So is today the day you'll tell them about you two?
是啊  我决定送我爸中风当他的生日礼物012---Yeah, for my dad's birthday, I decided to give him a stroke.
不  我想你应该告诉他们012---No, I think you should tell them.
不  我不知道他对我有多认真  在知道前  我什么都不说012---I don't know how serious he is. Until I do, I won't say anything.
很难说  我不认为爸妈会在意012---I don't think Mom and Dad would mind.
记得你9岁  理查30岁时  爸爸老是说…012---Remember when you were 9 and Richard was 30, Dad said:
〝天啊  真希望他们在一起〞012---"God, I hope they get together."
可以进了吗012---ROSS: Shall we?
好  等一下012---Okay, wait.
你知道吗012---You know what?
罗斯  我们换位子  你在中间012---Ross, let's switch places. You get in the middle.
这样看起来像是我们想隐瞒什么012---This looks like we're trying to cover something up.
摩妮卡  就算你你骑着他进去  他们还是不会相信012---You could come in straddling him, they still wouldn't believe it.
我们到了012---We're here!

生日快乐  爸  谢谢012---Happy birthday, Dad. Thank you.
生日快乐012---Happy birthday!
你们两个谢过柏克医生载你们吗012---So you kids thanked Dr. Burke for the ride?
事实上  妈  我想摩妮卡代我们两人谢过他了012---Actually, Mom, I think Monica thanked him for the both of us.
你们是坐火车来的012---So you kids take the train in?
不  理查·柏克载他们来的012---No, Richard Burke gave them a ride.
提到他啊…012---Speaking of whom...
我听说他在城里  跟20岁的无脑嫩妹在交往012---...I hear he's got some 20-year-old twinkie in the city.
手指抽筋  天啊012---Finger cramp! Oh, God!
对不起  来  我来清  妈012---Sorry. Here, let me get that, Mom.
所以说理查在青少年区购物012---So Richard's shopping in the junior section?
我们还在提那码子事012---Are we still on that?
想也知道她的智商  跟餐巾纸一样高012---You just know she's got the IQ of a napkin.
她说不定连漂亮都算不上012---She's probably not even pretty.
只是够年轻  所以一切都还坚挺012---Just young enough so that everything is still pointing up.
你能相信这地方吗012---Can you believe this place?
我了解  这间公寓真棒012---I know. This is a great apartment.
我刚上过洗手间  两侧都装了镜子012---In the bathroom there's mirrors on both sides of you.
你在上时  好像跟火箭女郎一起尿尿012---When you're in there, it's like peeing with the Rockettes.
我的幻想成真了012---Well, there's my fantasy come true.
这是说真的012---Seriously.
嗨012---Hey.
我们正好说到这间公寓真棒012---We were just saying, great apartment!
谢谢  你想租吗012---Thanks. You want it?
我要搬到更大的地方012---I'm moving to a bigger place.
你应该租下这间012---You should take this one.
你能想像我住这种地方吗012---Can you see me in a place like this?
有何不可  你讨厌公园景观和挑高天花板吗012---Why not? You hate park views and high ceilings?
来  我带你参观厨房012---Come on, I'll show you the kitchen.
没关系  我今天早上看过一间厨房012---That's all right, I saw a kitchen this morning.
在电视上012---On TV.
别讲话了  好吧012---Stop talking. Okay!
来吧  告诉我们  她真的20岁吗012---Come on, tell us! Is she really 20?
我什么也不告诉你们012---I am not telling you guys anything.
拜托  理查  今天是我生日  让我想像过那种生活的滋味012---Come on, it's my birthday. Let me live vicariously!
爸  你真的不该这么做012---Dad, you really don't want to do that.
朋友之间谈论下中年危机又怎样012---What's a little midlife crisis between friends?
杰克  你别逼问好吗012---Would you let it go?
我知道你的心路历程  我满50岁时  买了保时捷012---I know what you're going through. When I turned 50, I got the Porsche.
你则得到自己的“小跑车”012---You got your own little speedster.
说真的  不是那样   我告诉你012---Seriously, it's not like that. Tell you what.
也许找个周末  你可以借我的车  而我可以…012---Maybe one of these weekends you can borrow the car and I could...
爸  我恳求你别把话讲完012---Dad, I beg you not to finish that sentence!
什么  我只是开玩笑012---What? I'm kidding!
你知道我绝不会让他碰那辆保时捷012---You know I'd never let him touch the Porsche.
好  瑞秋012---Okay, Rach.
哪一种百合  这种百合还是那种百合012---Which lily? This lily or that lily?
我…  我喜欢这种百合012---Well, I...  I like this lily.
那绽放得更灿烂  就像我妈012---It's more open and that's like my mom.
她有更开放而奉献的精神012---She had a more open, giving spirit.
莱亨鸡012---Foghorn Leghorn!
金发女  你到二号房012---Blond girl? You're in room two.
没那么金发女  你跟我来012---Not-so-blond girl, you're with me.
要开始了012---Here we go! Uh-huh.
你不去012---You're not going.
嗯-哼012---Uh-huh.
跟罗斯说的话有关吗012---Is this because of what Ross said?
不是012---No.
是吧  也许  我不敢相信012---Well, yeah, maybe.  I don't believe this.
你谈这段恋爱都要这样吗  罗斯等于老板012---Is this how this relationship works? Ross equals boss?
拜托  什么年代了  还是1922年吗012---Come on, what is this, 1922?
1922年怎么了012---What's 1922?
只是指很久以前012---Just, you know, a long time ago.
那个年代的男人经常指使女人012---When men used to tell women what to do a lot.
然后有了投票权  这是好事  不过听起来很糟糕012---Then there was suffrage, which was a good thing. But it sounds horrible.
你想要刺青吗012---Do you want this tattoo?
我想  只是罗斯…012---Yes, I do. It's just that Ross...
你的男友是你老板吗012---Is your boyfriend the boss of you?
不是012---No.
你的老板是谁012---Who is the boss of you?
你012---You?
不  你是你自己的老板012---No. You are the boss of you!
大摇大摆走进去  在臀部刺上那刺青012---You march in there and get that tattoo on your hip!
去012---Go!
你还好吗012---How you doing?
我成了无脑嫩妹012---I'm a twinkie!
真的  我成了英雄012---Really? I'm a hero.
真难应付012---This is so hard.
我懂  我也讨厌这样012---Yeah, I know. I hate it too.
听着  也许我们该对他们直说012---Look, maybe we should just tell them.
也许我们该先告诉你父母012---Maybe we should just tell your parents first.
我父母都过世了012---My parents are dead.
天啊  你真好运012---God, you are so lucky!
我是说…你懂我的意思  我懂…012---I mean... Well, you know what I mean.
撑下去  好吗012---Just hang in there, okay?
好  我先出去  好吗  好012---Okay, I'll go out first, all right?
茱蒂  你想上洗手间  真不错012---Judy! Going to the bathroom. Good for you!
谢谢你  理查  感谢你的支持012---Thank you, Richard. I appreciate the support.
亲爱的012---Honey.
看到我的哈蒙基勒博球棒了吗  劳勃不相信我有012---Seen my Harmon Killebrew bat? Bob doesn't believe I have one.
不知道012---I have no idea.
你知道理查在城内  交了个无脑嫩妹吗012---Did you know Richard has a twinkie in the city?
我知道  他焕然一新  像是电影《魔茧》里的一样012---I know. He's a new man. It's like a scene from Cocoon.
我只是无法想像  理查跟无脑辣妹在一起012---I just never would have pictured Richard with a bimbo.
他告诉强尼夏皮洛  她很棒012---He told Johnny Shapiro that she's quite a girl.
其实他告诉强尼 他觉得自己爱上她了012---He told Johnny that he thinks he's falling in love with her.
真的  我从没看过他这么快乐012---Really?  I've never seen him this happy.
所以说  杰克…012---So, Jack...
有没有想过  把我换成更年轻的模特儿012---...ever think about trading me in for a younger model?
当然没有012---Of course not.
跟你一起  我像是交了两个25岁小妞012---With you, it's like I've got two 25-year-olds.
杰克  别这样012---Oh, Jack, stop!
来吧012---MR. GELLER: Come on!
这是我生日012---It's my birthday!
我们别提了好吗012---Can we drop this?
我对那男的公寓不感兴趣012---I am not interested in the guy's apartment.
拜托  我看到  你查看他壁饰的样子012---Oh, please. I saw the way you were checking out his moldings.
你想要它012---You want it.
我为何想要另一间公寓012---Why would I want another apartment?
我已经有我喜爱的公寓012---I've already got an apartment that I love.
你偶尔这么说又不会死012---It wouldn't kill you to say it once in a while.
好  你想听真话  我是在考虑012---All right. You want the truth? I'm thinking about it.
什么  对不起012---What?  I'm sorry.
我28岁了  从来没一个人住过012---I'm 28. I've never lived alone...
我现在的状况是  终于拥有足够的钱012---...and I'm at a place where I got enough money...
我不再需要室友了012---...that I don't need a roommate.
我也不需要室友012---Whoa, whoa, whoa. I don't need a roommate either.
我负担得起自己住在这里012---I can afford to live here by myself.
我也许得每周带个人过来舔一次餐具012---I may have to bring in somebody once a week to lick the silverware.
你为什么这样在意012---Why are you getting so bent out of shape?

对不起…对不起012---I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
你怎么可以这样对我  这都是你的主意012---How could you do this to me? This was your idea!
我知道  我本来要刺  但是他拿着这种针头出现012---I know! I was gonna get it, but he came in with this needle.
你知道他们用针头干嘛012---And did you know they do this with needles?
真的  不会吧012---Really? You don't say?
因为我的是由猫味舔上去的012---Because mine was licked on by kittens!

不  我是说你的什么新家012---No, I mean what's this about your new place?
我要搬出去  我们讨论过了012---I'm moving out, like we talked about.
我以为那不是认真的012---I didn't think that was serious.
我以为那只是拌个嘴012---You know, I thought that was just a fight.
对  那是拌嘴012---Well, it was a fight...
可是话题是认真的  记得吗012---...based on serious stuff, remember?
有关我从来没一个人住012---About how I never lived alone or anything?
我想这样对我有益  能帮助我成长…012---I think it would be good for me. Help me to grow...
有的没的012---...or whatever.

我得的分  会比你妹被上过的次数还多012---Your men will get scored on more times than your sister.
哇  哇  哇  哇012---Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
哪个妹妹012---Which sister?
你会难过  我告诉他们了吗012---So are you sorry that I told them?

我们在看什么012---What are we looking at?
蓝色雀斑012---That blue freckle?
这是我的刺青012---That's my tattoo.
那不是刺青  那什么也不是012---That is not a tattoo. That is a nothing.
我终于押她坐回椅子上…012---I got her in the chair...
他还没怎么用针头刺到她  她就跳起来惨叫  就此结束012---...he barely touched her with the needle, she screamed and that was it.
好  嗨012---Okay, hi!
假如你们不知道  这正是我要的012---For your information, this is exactly what I wanted.

你在天堂的母亲会说 〝我的百合在哪儿  你真没种〞012---Your mother's in heaven going, "Where the hell's my lily, you wuss!"
菲比  那不是刺青  这才是刺青012---That is not a tattoo! This is a tattoo!

那是我的胸罩吗012---Is that my bra?
你拿我的胸罩干嘛  你想歪了012---What are you doing with my bra? It's not what you think.
我们用那个来在屋顶上弹水球012---We used it to fling water balloons off the roof.
记得吗  那些国中生连弹过马路都办不到012---Remember? Those kids couldn't even get theirs across the street.
我记得012---Yeah, I remember.
咱们把剩下的搬上卡车012---Let's bring the rest of these down to the truck.

你能相信他们居然让史黛芬妮得了皮肤癌吗012---Can you believe they gave Stephanie skin cancer?
我真不敢相信他们升她为小队长012---I can't believe they promoted her to lieutenant.
你会这么说是因为你爱上雅丝敏布莉012---You're saying that because you love Yasmine Bleeth.
怎么可能有人不爱雅丝敏布莉012---How could anyone not love Yasmine Bleeth?
嘿  在跑步了012---Hey. Hey, they're running.

是啊  我还以为那样会很好012---I did. I thought it'd be great.
我以为那样一来  我就有时间好好思考012---I figured I'd have time alone with my thoughts.
但结果我发现  我根本没有你认为的那么多好思考的012---But it turns out I don't have as many thoughts as you'd think.
那你何不找钱德商量  然后搬回去好了012---Joey, why don't you talk to Chandler about moving back?
你们真的认为他会收容我吗012---You really think he'd take me?
昨晚我们聊得很好…012---We had a good talk last night...
但是当初我搬出去时  我伤他很深012---...but when I moved out, I hurt him bad.
我保证  他一定会欢迎你搬回去的012---I promise you, he would definitely want you back.
他才不会搬回来012---I'm telling you, there's no way he's moving back.
但我们昨晚真的聊得非常愉快012---But we had one of the greatest talks we ever had last night. Heh.
那就好像…012---I mean, it was...
我们当初刚搬在一起住时一样012---It was like when we first started living together.
我知道你不想听…012---Look, I know you don't want to hear this right now...
但我们看到他在新家的样子  他真的很快乐012---...but we've seen him in his new place. And he's happy.
他真的装潢过了012---He's decorated.
钱德  他已经向前迈出去  好吗  你也不要眷恋过去012---Look, Chandler, he has moved on, okay? You have to, too.
你要接受现在你们只是朋友的事实012---No, you're just gonna have to accept the fact that you're just friends now.
你们不再是…012---You're not...
室友了012---...roommates anymore.

乔伊会回来把他的麋鹿帽子拿走  还是要我把它扔了012---Is that Joey guy gonna pick up his moose hat or should I toss it?
你何不亲自问他呢  乔伊  这位是我的新室友艾迪012---Why don't you ask him yourself? This is my new roommate, Eddie.
幸会012---EDDIE: Nice to meet you.
我也是012---Likewise. How you doing?

这下子那是空房间了012---Oh, now it's a spare room?
是啊  既然没有人在用…012---Well, yeah. In that it's not being used...
我又让它空着012---...and I have it to spare.

臭猫  臭猫012---Smelly cat, smelly cat

喔  不012---Oh, no
我以前从没听过自己的歌声012---I've never heard myself sing before.

我来拿我的邮件012---I just, uh, came by to pick up my mail.
邮件在哪里  在桌上012---Where's the mail?  Oh, it's, uh, over there on the table.
你现在不像以前那样  放在桌子上了吗012---You don't keep it on this table anymore?
不  艾迪习惯把邮件放那边012---No, Eddie likes it over there.
好吧  给你  艾迪式煎蛋012---All right, here you go, my friend. Eggs à la Eddie, huh.
哦  哦012---Ooh. Ooh.
太棒了012---Oh, oh. That's great.
呵012---Huh.
怎么了012---What?
我还以为你喜欢的是我做的面包夹蛋012---I thought you liked your eggs...
中间还穿个洞的那个012---...with the bread with the hole in the middle, à la me.
我是啊  但艾迪的做法是这样  非常好吃012---I do, but, uh, Eddie makes them this way. They're pretty darn good.

〝再见了  大家〞012---"See you, pals."
果汁也没了012---And now there's no juice!
没留果汁给想喝果汁的人  我想喝果汁012---There's no juice for the people who need the juice. I need the juice!
那边还有一盒012---There's another carton right over there.
这不再是关于果汁的事了  好吗012---Hey, this isn't about juice anymore, all right, man?
好吧012---All right.
那么是关于什么呢012---So, what's it about?
蛋012---Eggs.
谁的蛋蛋你比较喜欢  他的还是我的012---Whose eggs do you like better, his or mine, huh?
两个人的蛋蛋我都喜欢  少来了012---Well, I like both eggs equally. Oh, come on!
没有人会同样喜欢两种蛋012---Nobody likes two kinds of eggs equally.
你一定比较喜欢一种胜过另一种  而我要知道答案012---You like one better, and I wanna know which.
这有什么差别   你的蛋蛋现在又不在这里了012---What's the difference? Your eggs aren't here anymore.
你把你的蛋蛋带走  然后搬离了这里012---You took your eggs, and you left!
难道你以为我从此  就找不到新蛋蛋了吗012---Did you really expect me to never find new eggs?
今晚我想要看《娱乐百分百》012---I wanna watch Entertainment Tonight.

你小时候恨死我了吗  是012---You hated me when we were kids?  Yes.
我恨死你了012---I hated you.
我就像〝你是我哥  所以我必须爱你〞那样爱你012---I loved you in a you're-my-brother- so-I-have-to way...
但基本上我是恨你的012---...but basically, I hated your guts.
你干嘛要恨我012---Why did you hate me?
因为你对我很坏…012---Because you were mean to me...
你老是逗我  然后很霸道012---...and you teased me and you always got your way.
你不觉得那很有趣吗012---That wasn't fun for you?
嗯-哼012---Uh-huh.
我不敢相信你会恨我012---I can't believe you hated me.
但现在我爱你啊012---But now I love you.
而且不是因为我没得选择012---And not just because I have to.
真的吗012---Really?
耶012---Yeah.
但你不能再惹火我了012---You're just gonna have to stop pissing me off.
这我办得到012---I can do that.

但据制作人说012---But according to the producer people...
他们说  她的样子长得不对之类的 懂吗012---...they said, like, she doesn't have the right look or something. You know?
她就像那种动物收容所里的动物…012---She's like one of those animals at the pound...
只因为他们不够漂亮就没有人要012---...who nobody wants because they're not pretty.
或是一些老狗因为太臭又…012---Or, you know, like some old dog who's kind of like stinky and...
天啊  她就是〝臭猫〞嘛012---Oh, my God! She's smelly cat!

我其实是你的同父异母兄弟012---I'm actually your half-brother.

菲比只是开玩笑  她疯了012---Phoebe's kidding. Phoebe's crazy.
菲比完蛋了012---Phoebe's dead.

没错  是有提过你的名字…012---Yeah, your, uh, name came up...
在一个让我惊心动魄的谈话中012---...in a conversation that terrified me to my very soul.
他很激烈  对吧012---He's kind of intense, huh?
没错  让我问你一个问题  艾迪是不是有一点…012---Yes! Hey, can I ask you, is Eddie a little...
一点怎样  有点乡村012---A little what? ...bit country?
进来吧  室友012---Come on in, you roomie!
你好  堤莉012---Hello, Tilly.
艾迪  我只是把鱼缸  拿过来给你012---Eddie, I just came by to drop off your tank.
你真的很周到012---That was very thoughtful of you.
真的很周到012---It's very thoughtful.
那好吧012---Well, okay then.
我要走了  再见012---I'm gonna go. Bye.

你和她上过床了  对不对012---You had sex with her, didn't you?
菲比  快来看012---Pheebs! Check it out, check it out!
噢  是《肥皂剧文摘》 我的最爱之一012---Oh, ooh, Soap Opera Digest! That's one of my favorite digests!

好  好棒的照片012---Yeah. Yeah.  Oh, cool picture!
我看起来真棒012---Ah. Oh, I look good.
这是真的吗  你很多台词都是自己写的012---Is this true? That you write a lot of your own lines?
算是啦012---Well, kind of, yeah.
记得上星期亚莉发生意外吗012---Remember last week when Alex was in the accident?
原本的台词是…012---The line in the script was:
〝如果不把她送到医院  她就会死掉〞012---"If we don't get this woman to a hospital, she's going to die."
但是我把它改成 〝如果不把她送到医院…012---But I made it, "If this woman doesn't get to a hospital...
她就活不了〞012---...she's not gonna live."
噢  我懂了012---Oh, okay. I see what you did there.
你不怕编剧读到这个时  会生气吗012---Aren't you afraid the writers will be kind of mad when they read this?
呵012---Huh.
我从不考虑那些编剧  剧本就是送到我家012---I never thought about the writers. The scripts just come to my house.
但是你知道吗012---But you know what?
这让我有面子  也让节目有面子…012---This makes me look good, which makes the show look good...
编剧也有面子  他们不应该生气  对吧012---...which makes the writers look good. So how could they be mad?
很多台词都是自己写的012---WRITER: Makes up most of his lines.
这个臭…012---Son of a...
好  我就写给你看012---Yeah. Write this, jerk-weed.
我从电梯井跌下去012---I fall down an elevator shaft?
这什么意思  我从电梯井跌下去012---What does this mean? I fall down an elevator shaft?
我不知道  我只是送剧本的012---Uh, I don't know. I just bring the scripts.
他们不能杀掉我  我可是法兰旧斯卡失散的儿子012---They can't kill me! I'm Francesca's long-lost son!
是啊012---Right.
你可以签名吗012---Uh, could you sign?
不要  我才不签012---No! No way! I'm not signing that!
我不认为这会影响剧情012---I don't think that's gonna affect the plot of the show.
他们怎么可以这样对我012---How can they do this to me?
好  我要走了012---All right, uh, I'm just gonna go.
很遗憾012---Sorry.
也没有那么多男性012---Well, it wasn't that many guys.
如果你想想  这世上有多少男性的话…012---If you consider how many guys there actually are...
比例其实很小  嘿012---...it's a very small percentage.  Hey.
没什么大不了的  我只是好奇而已012---It's not that big a deal. I was just curious.
晚安  晚安  理查012---Good night. Good night, Richard.
祝你好运  摩妮卡012---Good luck, Mon.
好吧  在我说之前  先说你和几位女性交往过012---All right, before I tell you, uh, you tell me how many women you've been with.
两个  两个  两个012---Two. Two? Two? Heh.
怎么可能012---How is that possible? I mean...
你有看过自己的样子吗012---...have you seen you?
我能说什么呢012---Well, I mean, what can I say?
我和芭芭拉做了三十年的夫妻  她是我高中的女友012---I was married to Barbara for 30 years, my high-school sweetheart.
再加上你  就是两个人了012---Now you. That's two.
那就两个吧012---Two it is. Heh. Mm-hm.
好  该睡觉了  我先去刷牙012---Okay, time for bed. I'm gonna brush my teeth.
不行  等等012---Whoa, no, wait a minute now!
别这样  轮到你了012---Come on, it's your turn.
你少来012---Oh, come on!
我不需要确切的数字  差不多就行了012---You know, I don't need the actual number. Just a ballpark.
好  绝对没有棒球场的人多012---Okay, it is definitely less than a ballpark.
哇  真庆幸我不是摩妮卡012---Wow, I am so glad I'm not Monica right now.
没错012---Tell me about it.
那你的神奇数字是多少012---So, what's your magic number?
恩012---Ahh...
别这样  我交往过的你都认识  两个都知道012---Come on, you know everyone I've been with. All both of them.
嗯  有你012---Well, ahem, there's you.
最好不要说我是第一个012---Better not be doing these in order.
好  比利 彼特012---Okay, uh, Billy Dreskin, Pete Carny.
巴瑞012---Ah. Barry.
还有  噢巴洛012---And, uh, oh, Paolo.
是啊  那个托里尼来的蠢蛋012---Oh, yes, the weenie from Turinie.
噢  亲爱的  你嫉妒巴洛吗012---Oh, honey, are you jealous of Paolo?
我跟你在一起  比跟他快乐多了012---I'm so much happier with you than I ever was with him.
真的吗   拜托012---Really? Oh, please.
跟巴洛那段  根本称不上感情关系012---That Paolo thing was barely a relationship.
充其量只是无意义的  野兽性关系012---All it really was was just meaningless, animal sex.
嗯  那句话在我脑海里  听起来好很多012---Okay, you know, that sounded so much better in my head.
艾迪  我没有和你的前女友上床012---Eddie! I didn't sleep with your ex-girlfriend.
真有趣  跟她睡过的人  就会这么说012---That's exactly what someone who slept with her would say.
太疯狂了  她只待了两分钟…012---This is nuts! Crazy! She came over for two minutes...
留下鱼缸就走了  只有这样012---...dropped off a fish tank and left! End of story.
巴迪在哪里  巴迪012---Where's Buddy? Buddy?
我的鱼  巴迪012---My fish, Buddy.
她来的时候没有鱼啊012---There was no fish when she dropped it off.
噢  真是无法置信012---Oh, this is unbelievable!
你先是跟我的前女友上床  再说谎侮辱我的智商…012---You sleep with my ex-girlfriend, insult my intelligence by lying...
然后杀掉我的鱼  我的巴迪012---...then you kill my fish? My Buddy?
我没有杀掉你的鱼012---I didn't kill your fish!
听着  艾迪…012---Look, Eddie...
看看我在做什么012---Would you look at what I'm doing?
绝对不是明智之举012---Now that can't be smart.
把这个家伙从你身上拿开…012---So we're just gonna take this guy right off you...
放到口袋里面012---...and put him here in Mr. Pocket.
来颗橘子吗012---Tangelo?
就这样  你害怕告诉我的数字  只有这样012---That's it? That's the giant number you were afraid to tell me?
是啊  不会太糟啊012---Well, yeah.  Well, that's not bad at all.
我还以为有一整个舰队呢012---You had me thinking it was, like, a fleet.
你真的不介意012---You're okay with it?
亲爱的  我没问题012---Oh, honey, I'm fine.
好耶012---Oh, yay!
好  你那两个人012---Okay, about that two.
什么012---What?
好012---All right.
我那两个人怎么了012---What about my two?
那个数目真的很小012---It just seems like a really small number.
对012---Right.
所以呢   嗯…012---And?  And, well...
你没有欲望到处去采花吗012---Don't you have a lot of wild oats to sow?
你现在就是那样对我吗  天啊  我是花吗012---Or is that what you're doing with me? Oh, my God! Am I an oat?
亲爱的  你不是花012---Honey, you are not an oat.
我也不知道  我不是那种采花大盗012---I don't know, I guess I'm just not an oat guy.
我只和我爱的人上床012---I've only slept with women I love.
但你只跟两个人睡过012---You've only slept with two people.
对012---Right.
哇012---Wow.
哦  哇012---Oh, wow.
你知道我也爱你吧012---You know I love you too, right?
我现在知道了012---Now I do.
罗斯012---Ugh, Ross!
罗斯  请你听我说012---Ross, please listen to me.
罗斯  你比巴洛好太多了012---Ross, you are so much better for me than Paolo ever was.
你关心我  你爱我  你让我发笑012---You care about me, you're loving, you make me laugh.
那样的话  我有个主意012---If I make you laugh, here's an idea.
你就邀请巴洛过来野性一下  我就站在角落…012---Invite Paolo to have a romp in the sack, and I'll stand in the corner...
讲些笑话给你听  罗斯012---...and tell knock-knock jokes. Ross! Agh!
天啊  罗斯012---God, Ross!
你和我的关系很特别  巴洛和我只是…012---What you and I have is special! All Paolo and I ever had was...
野兽性关系012---Animal sex, animal sex?
你是什么意思012---So, what are you saying?
我们之间完全没有野性吗012---There's nothing between us "animal" at all?
连小野兽都没有吗012---There's not even, like, um, a little animal?
连…012---Not even, like...
花粟鼠性关系都没有012---...chipmunk sex?
好  罗斯…012---Okay, Ross...
试着听进去我说的话012---Try to hear me, okay?
嘿  我不会对你说谎012---I... Hey. I'm not gonna lie to you.
跟巴洛很棒  笑话来了012---It was good with Paolo.  Knock-knock.
但你和我的关系  好太多了012---But what you and I have is so much better.
我们之间有温柔  有亲密  灵犀相通012---We have tenderness, we have intimacy, we connect.
是真的  我发誓012---You know? I swear.
到目前为止…012---This is the best...

直到这一刻012---Until now. - Aah!

我今天早上起来时…012---So when I woke up this morning...
他偷走我所有鞋子的鞋垫012---...he'd stolen all the insoles out of my shoes!
为什么012---Why?
因为他认为我和他的前女友上床  而且杀掉他的鱼012---He thinks I slept with his ex-girlfriend and killed his fish.
你为什么要杀掉他的鱼012---Why would you kill his fish?
因为有时候你和某人睡过以后…012---Because sometimes after you sleep with someone...
就得杀掉一条鱼012---...you have to kill a fish.
钱德…012---Chandler, honey...
真的很遗憾012---...I'm sorry.

我不知道  我希望  没有人会知道012---I don't know. I was kind of hoping no one would ever find out.
或许他们有办法  让你活过来012---Well, maybe they could find a way to bring you back.
不会的  他们说尸体的大脑  已经摔得稀巴烂了012---No, they said that when they found my body, my brain was so smashed in...
唯一能救我的人是我012---...that the only doctor who could've saved me was me.
还说这是某种讽刺之类的012---It's supposed to be some kind of irony.
但是乔伊  你不会有事的012---But Joey, you're gonna be fine.
你不需要那个节目  那只是个蠢肥皂剧012---You don't need that show. It was just a dumb soap opera.
这是我这辈子  最棒的事012---This was the greatest thing that ever happened to me.
对  我正要说到那一点012---Yes! I was going to incorporate that.
太好了  摩妮卡来了  她会说句好听的012---Oh, good, here's Monica. She'll have something nice to say.
我把你的浴帘拉直了  免得发霉012---Um, I straightened out your shower curtain so you won't get mildew.
干嘛  那是好事啊012---What? To me, that's nice.
不会有事的  你知道的012---It's gonna be okay. You know that.
我不知道012---No, I don't.
这好像你奋斗了一辈子  追求某样东西…012---It's like you work your whole life for something...
当你以为你办到的时候…012---...and you think that when you get it...
永远不会像你想像得那么好012---...it'll never be as good as you thought.
不过这个是啊012---But this so was.
它改变了一切012---It changed everything.
前几天  我去申请信用卡…012---Like, the other day, I got this credit card application...
我竟然被预先核淮012---...and I was pre-approved!
我这辈子从没被预先核淮过012---Huh? I've never been pre-approved for anything in my life!
真的很遗憾012---I'm sorry, man.
我不知道这样  对你有没有意义…012---I don't know if this'll mean anything to you...
但你在我们之中  永远都是预先核淮012---...but you'll always be pre-approved with us.
没有  一点意义都没有012---No, that means nothing to me.
啊012---Ahh!
要吃大胡桃饼吗  刚出炉的012---Pecan sandy? Just made them.

我想过我们目前  住在一起的情况了012---I've been thinking about our living situation and, uh...
你在笑什么012---Why are you smiling?
我有个小惊喜  有条新的鱼012---I got a little surprise. Look. There's a new fishy.
我把它命名为…012---I named him, uh...
钱德  以你为名012---...Chandler, you know, after you.
那根本不是条真的鱼012---Well, that's not even a real fish.
那只是金鱼饼干012---No, that's a Goldfish cracker.
什么意思012---So, what's your point, man?
好  晚安了012---Okay, good night.
你这个大怪胎012---You big freak of nature.
嘿012---Aah. Hey.

请继续012---Ha, ha. Ahem. Please.
现在我睡不着了012---I can't sleep now!
你要我唱歌给你听吗012---Oh, you want me to sing?
不  听着012---No. Look.
够了  我要你立刻离开这间公寓012---That's it. I want you out of the apartment now!
你在胡说什么012---Oh, what are you talking about?
人魔汉尼拔012---Hannibal Lecter?
他比你更适合当室友012---Better roommate than you.
不012---No.
我觉得你不公平  某天晚上你看到我  觉得很可怕012---I don't think you're being fair! One night you see me, you get scared.

风让我们成为女神012---And the wind can make us goddesses.
你知道谁把我们的风抢走了吗   男人  他们抢走风了012---Do you know who takes our wind? Men. They just take it.
男人抢走风了012---Men just take our wind?
一直都是的  因为他们是闪电人012---Uh-huh. All the time. Because they are the lightning-bearers.
哇  耶012---Wow. Yeah.
那听起来很酷  蛮像哈比人的012---That sounds kind of cool. It's like The Hobbit.
一点都不像012---It is nothing like The Hobbit.

别担心  情况很不错012---Don't worry about it, already! Things happen.
所以你不气我被开除012---So you're not mad at me for getting fired and everything?

我怎么从神经外科医生  变成开计程车的012---How can I go from being a neurosurgeon to driving a cab?

这是在退步012---It's like taking a step backwards.
我才不要这份工作012---I'm not gonna do this.
乔伊012---Joey.
我跟你说的话就像我跟阿尔明查012---I'm gonna tell you the same thing I told Al Minza...

这像是在看我的一生012---Uh. This is like reading about my own life!
这本书应该叫 《做你自己的追风人  瑞秋》012---This book could have been called Be Your Own Wind Keeper, Rachel!
虽然会卖不了一百万本012---It wouldn't have sold a million copies...

不012---No!
不012---No? Heh.
不  为什么我们总得  照你的时间表来做事012---No! Why do we always have to do everything according to your timetable?
事实上那是电影院的时间表012---Actually, it's the movie theater that has the timetable.
这样你才不会错过开头012---It's so you don't miss the beginning.
不  这跟电影院无关  问题是你抢走我的风了012---This isn't about the movie theater. This is about you stealing my wind.
加油  好姊妹012---You go, girl!
我做得很不像吧012---I can't pull that off, can I?
对不起  你的风012---Excuse me, your wind?

你可以开始在《未来日记》开计程车012---You can start by driving a cab on Another World.
什么  那个试镜机会012---What?  That audition?
那个角色只有两句台词012---That's a two-line part!
乔伊  你在〝我爱透明塑胶玻璃〞欠下一千一百块012---Joey, you owe $1100 at "I Love Lucite."
那又怎么样  接受吧012---So what?  So suck it up, man.

我不要你变得爱批评  高傲又爱卖弄学问012---I don't need you getting judgmental and condescending and pedantic.

不必了  你应该是我的朋友  我是你的朋友012---You're supposed to be my friend!  I am your friend.
那你该跟我说〝你会没事的〞012---Then tell me things like, "You'll be fine."
〝你一定会出头的  我知道〞012---And "Something big's gonna come along. I know it!"
但我真的不知道012---But I don't know it.

罗斯  我知道我欠了多少钱012---I'm aware of what I owe.
你得有点理智  你等了十年才找到那份工作012---Then get some sense. It took you 10 years to get that job.
下份工作又得等多久  我不想听012---How long till you get another?  I don't want to hear this!
我只是说…012---I'm just saying...
别〝只是说〞012---Well, don't "just say"!
或许我该先离开012---Oh. Maybe I should just go.
好吧012---Okay.
待会见012---I'll see you later.

对了  我帮我们买了新金鱼012---Oh, yeah. I got us a new goldfish.
他比上一只金鱼还有活力012---He's feistier than the last one.
或许因为上一只金鱼  是培珀莉饼干做的012---Maybe because the last one was made by Pepperidge Farm.
艾迪  你是不是忘了做什么事012---Eddie, isn't there something else you're supposed to be doing now?
不  除非它跟脱水有关012---Not unless it's got something to do with dehydrating.
因为现在我是脱水迷012---Because right now, I'm a dehydrating maniac!

他们会把完整剧本寄过来给我012---...they'd send over the whole script on real paper.
那真的太棒了012---Ha, ha. That's great.
如果你要加戏  譬如让计程车发生车祸012---If you wanted to expand this scene, like have the cab crash...

你怎么买得到衣服穿012---How do you find clothes that fit?
摩妮卡  我们有个问题012---Oh, hey, Monica? We got a question.
对  我在健身房淋浴间  看到别的女人012---All right, yes, I see other women in the shower at the gym.
不  我不会乱看012---And no, I don't look.
不  不是那个问题012---No, not that one.
我们在想该带谁去看《尼克队》比赛  有多一张票012---We're figuring out who to bring to the Knicks game.
罗斯不能去  我们得在我的口臭朋友 艾力克普洛威012---Ross can't go, so it's between my friend Eric Prower, who has breath issues...
还有爱戳人的丹之间做选择 〝你看到那一球了吗"012---...and Dan, with the poking. "Did you see that play?"
〝还要喝啤酒吗  那是史派克李吗〞012---"You want more beer? Is that Spike Lee?"
好了012---Ha, ha, okay.
你们何不问理查呢012---Why don't you ask Richard?
理查  如果你多了一张《尼克队》门票…012---Uh, Richard, if you had an extra ticket to the Knicks game...
…而你必须在有口臭的朋友…012---...and you had to choose between a friend who smelled...

很高兴能帮上忙  我去抽烟012---Glad to be of help. Matches.
我是说你们何不约理查去看球赛012---I meant, why don't you take Richard to the game?
哦012---CHANDLER & JOEY: Eh.
什么012---What?
我不知道  少来了012---I don't know.  Come on!
他不会乱戳人  而且口气清新012---He keeps his fingers to himself, and he's always minty fresh.
理查人不错  但我们跟他不熟012---Richard's really nice. Uh, we just don't know him really well.
而且他很老012---Plus, he's old...
比一些人老012---- er than some people.
但比一些建筑物年轻012---But, uh, younger than some buildings.
那又怎么样  他年纪有点大  没什么大不了的012---So what, he's a little older. Big deal.
他对我来说很重要012---He's important to me.
如果你们问他  或许他会开捷豹跑车载你们去012---If you ask him, he might take you in his Jag.
我们要怎么答应她012---How do we say yes...
同时装做我们不是为了想搭跑车012---...and make it seem like it's not just to ride in the cool car?
好吧  这可能有点难012---Okay, this could be tough.
好吧  摩妮卡012---Okay, okay, okay. Monica?
我们可以带他去  但他一定开捷豹跑车012---We'll bring him, but only if he takes the Jaguar.
你差点就成功了012---Ooh, you almost had it.
不  尿布没脏012---No, no, you're fine. You're fine.
哈罗  嘿012---Hello, ha, ha. Hey.
甜心012---Hi, honey. Oh.
你们不会相信发生了什么事012---You are not gonna believe what happened!
我们在地上玩  他抓住桌子012---We were playing on the floor, and he grabs the table...
自己站起来012---...and he pulls himself up!
他自己站起来012---He pulled himself up!
他站起来了012---Standing man!
我很遗憾你们错过了  如果你们想看  我都拍下来了012---I'm sorry you missed it, but I did tape it if you wanna see it.
我们知道  上星期他就会那么做012---Uh, we know. He already did it last week.
如果你要的话  你可以看我们的录影带012---You can watch our tape if you want.
听着  我不敢相信  我错过所有的第一次012---Ah, see, I don't believe this. I missed the first time of everything.

他有最喜欢的酒类饮料吗012---Does he have a favorite liqueur?
他就快会说话了012---He is getting closer on the talking thing.
他还不会叫妈妈  但有一次他说〝阿姆〞012---He can't quite say "mama" yet, but once he said "Yemen."
我不知道  我厌倦了老是在错过012---See, I don't know. I'm so sick of missing stuff.
我不只要陪他一天  我要陪他一整个周末012---I want him for more than a day. I want him for a whole weekend.
听着  我认为…012---Listen. I feel...
那应该会很棒012---That would be great.
真的吗  我准备了一大套台词012---Really? I had a whole speech prepared.
真可惜  应该很有趣012---Oh, shoot, that would've been fun.
你们看到了吗012---Oh, look, did you just see that?
你们看到了吗  他挥手了012---Did you see? He just waved! He just waved!

她说我妈不让我们看悲伤电影结局012---...and she said my mom used to not show us the ends of sad movies...
不希望我们接触到痛苦与悲伤012---...to shield us from the pain and sadness.
知道吗  就在她自杀前012---You know, before she killed herself.
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
理查在哪里  你们甩了他012---Where's Richard? Did you ditch him?
在我们偷了他的午餐钱  还拉他的内裤之后012---After we stole his lunch money and gave him a wedgie.
怎么了  他去停车012---What's the matter with you? He's parking the car.
你们玩得开心吗   你男朋友太酷了012---Did you guys have fun?  Your boyfriend is so cool.
他让我们闻他的捷豹跑车  乔伊开了12条街  我是15条街012---He let us drive his Jaguar. Joey for 12 blocks. Me for 15.
哇012---Wow.
他一定最喜欢你012---He must like you best.
他给带位员小费那一段呢012---Oh, what about when he tipped the guy who showed us to our seats?
根本没看到他拿出钱012---You never even saw the money.
钱德  谢谢你帮我们带位012---Hey, Chandler, thanks for showing us to our seats.
不客气  乔伊  谢谢你帮忙停车012---Ha, ha, you're welcome. Hey, Joey, thanks for parking the car.

我念大学时认识的一个女孩  是那里的第一位女铁匠012---A woman I went to college with is the first female blacksmith there.
殖民时期的威廉斯堡  有点跟不上时代012---They're a little behind the times in colonial Williamsburg.
听着  我得走了  不然妈妈要哭了012---Ha, ha. Well, look, I better go before Mommy starts weeping.
我们爱你  再见  妈妈012---We love you.  Bye, Mommy.
好好玩吧012---Have a good time.

乔伊  你知道我们在这里能看到你吗012---Joey, do you know we can see you from here?
为什么理查这么做就是比我酷012---How come Richard looks cooler with one of these?
或许你得先点雪茄  然后放下铲子012---You may wanna light it and lose the spatula.
那真的很可爱  你试着模仿理查012---It's cute, you trying to be more like Richard.
我不是在学他012---Not like him, per se.
只是不想跟他不一样012---Just not unlike him.
他是之前名为钱德的艺人012---It's the artist formerly known as Chandler.
我是在尝试新造型012---I'm just trying something here, you know?
为什么你不留胡子012---Why didn't you grow a mustache?
我们丢铜板决定012---Oh, we flipped for it.
我抽到雪茄  他抽到胡子012---I got the cigar, he got the mustache.
如果我们两个都留胡子  看起来会很像呆瓜012---If we both grew them, we'd look like dorks.
你们真的不像呆瓜012---You really sidestepped that land mine.
我答应理查到楼下跟他碰面012---I promised Richard we'd meet downstairs.
你们跟理查有约012---You're meeting Richard?

他说他要跟朋友出去  我不知道他是指你们012---He said he was going out with the guys. I didn't know that was you.
你听到了吗012---You hear that?
我们是朋友 我们是朋友012---We're the guys!  We're the guys!
他留胡子的样子  让你想起席薇亚阿姨012---With that mustache, he reminds me of Aunt Sylvia.
没错012---Thank you!
嗨  我们来了012---Hi, we're visiting. Yay.
小班跟爸爸012---It's Ben and his dada.
爸爸012---Dada.
你会叫爸爸吗012---Can you say "dada"?  Aw.
我跟你的妈妈们说你会说  所以你非说不可012---I'm telling your mommies you said it, so you might as well.
运气不好  没错012---No luck, huh?  No.
刚刚我听到他说二012---A while ago, I got a "seh" out of him...
我以为他是说第二照顾者  可是…012---...which I thought might turn into "seh-condary caregiver," but...
你能帮我抱抱他吗  我得把包包放好012---Would you, uh, hold him for a sec? I gotta take this off.
好的  没问题012---Oh, yeah, sure, okay. There we go.
你在做什么012---What are you doing?
我在抱小班012---I'm holding Ben.
对  他是小宝宝  不是炸弹012---Yeah, well, he's a baby, not a bomb.
好的012---Okay.
像抱足球一样抱着他012---Hold him like you'd hold a football.
我都是这样抱足球的012---This is how I would hold a football.
来吧  好了012---Here. Here. There we go.
抱歉  我不太会带小孩  我一直跟小孩没什么接触012---Sorry, I'm not very good with babies. I haven't been around them.
我是说从我一岁后012---I mean, you know, since I was one. Ha, ha.
没关系  没什么大不了的  真的吗012---It's all right. No big deal. Really?
我相信我们生了孩子后  你会有不一样的想法012---You'll feel different when it's our baby.
什么  什么012---What?  What?
你想过那种事了012---You think about stuff like that?
对  我是说…012---Uh, yeah. I mean...
事实上我想我们得生两个012---Actually, I kind of think that we'll have two babies.
生两个012---Two babies?
你知道的  一男一女012---You know, a boy and a girl.
我希望先生女儿  小班才不会有竞争压力012---Hopefully, the girl will come first, so Ben won't feel competitive.
之后呢012---Then what's gonna happen?
我们不想让孩子们在城市里长大  所以我们会搬到史卡戴尔012---We won't wanna raise kids in the city, so we'll move to Scarsdale.
史卡... 嗯-哼012---Scar... Uh-huh.
我们可以远离我们的爸妈  不必看到他们012---We'll be far enough from our parents so we don't have to see them...
但距离也够近  他们能来当褓姆012---...but close enough that they can babysit.
对  我知道税率比拿索郡高012---And yes, I know the taxes are a little higher than Nassau County...
但学区非常不错012---...but the school system's great.
哇  哈哈012---Wow! Ha, ha.
那真的太棒了012---Wow, that's great! Great!

还有  恩...012---And, um...
我要去帮这些非常好的人倒咖啡012---I'm gonna go pour these very nice people some coffee.
好吧012---Okay.
看吧  我没拿咖啡壶012---Look at that. I don't have a pot.
我没拿咖徘壶  或许我把咖啡壶放在家里012---I don't have a pot. Maybe I've got one at home.
或是放在史卡戴尔了  那是门吗012---Or in Scarsdale. Hey, is that a door?
瑞秋012---Rach.

剧情保证美好012---Wonderfulness is baked right in.
我被《洋基之光》骗了012---I fell for that with Pride of the Yankees.
我以为电影描述《洋基队》的光荣012---I thought I'd see a film about Yankee pride.
结果是主角得了路贾里格症012---And boom! The guy gets Lou Gehrig's disease.
主角就是路贾里格  你没发现吗012---Uh, the guy was Lou Gehrig. Didn't you kind of see it coming?

他们有彼此的陪伴012---They have each other.
不  甜心  别担心012---Oh, no, honey. I mean, don't worry.
我喜欢跟他们在一起  他们跟我其他的朋友不一样012---I like hanging out with them. They're different than my other friends.
他们不会一开始就说 〝你知道谁在铲雪时死掉了吗〞012---They don't start sentences with "You know who just died shoveling snow?"
好吧  太棒了  快去吧012---All right, that's great. Then just go.

好吧  那么快去吧  好的012---Okay, then just go.  Okay.
为什么我觉得很困扰012---Ugh, why does this bother me so much?
我不是那种想每天24小时  都黏在一起的人012---I'm not one of those people who wants to spend 24 hours a day together.
当然012---Sure.
只是他的空闲时间不多  我该怎么办012---He just doesn't have much free time. What do I do?
那重要吗  反正你会死掉  离婚或轰掉宠物的头012---Does it matter? You'll just die or divorce or blow your pet's head off.

他们是菲比  钱德跟乔伊  反正我也记不住012---Uh, this is Phoebe and Chandler and Joey. I'll never remember all of that.
怎么了012---So, uh, what's the deal?
瑞秋一回家  就会有人跳出来大叫012---Rachel comes home, people pop out and yell stuff? Is that it?
这不是你第一次参加惊喜派对吧012---This isn't your first surprise party, is it, sir?
你好  摩妮卡012---Hi, Monica.

葛林医生  请跟我来  我们得把你的外套放在瑞秋床上012---Hey, Dr. Green, come with me. We'll put your jacket on Rachel's bed.
好吧  听起来那需要两个人才能做好012---All right. That sounds like a two-person job.
天啊  那是怎么一回事012---Well, my goodness. What was that?
抱歉  我以为你是瑞秋012---Sandra, I am so sorry. I thought you were Rachel.
我们还没准备好012---And we weren't ready for you yet.
你以为我是瑞秋  对  因为你看起来很年轻012---You thought I was Rachel? Yes, because, uh, you look so young.
因为你们都是白种女人012---And because you're both, you know, white women.
我很想念你们012---Oh, I missed you kids.
我该把外套放到卧室去吗012---Well, should I put my coat in the bedroom?

我等不及要听完其他部分  但我得去上厕所012---I can't wait to hear the rest, but I have to go to the bathroom.
跟我来吧012---So... Hey, come with me.
什么  就当我们是好朋友012---What?  Yeah, yeah. It will be like we're gal pals.

乔伊跟钱德  你们该带葛林医生去你们家012---So, Joey and Chandler, I think it's time that you take Dr. Green over to your place.
当然012---Uh, yes, absolutely.
为什么012---Um, why, again?
因为派对要在那里举行  笨蛋012---Because that's where the party is, you goon.
这里只是准备区012---See, this is just the staging area.
这里只是准备区  对  这里是准备区012---Right, it's the staging area. This is the staging area.

千万别提 〝我正在跟你女儿上床〞012---Uh, let's just stay clear of "I'm the guy that's doing your daughter"...
你应该就会没事  好吧012---...and you should be okay.
大家快来拿张纸012---Okay, people, I want you to take a piece of paper...

我很遗憾012---I'm sorry.
那是我工作上的一大好处012---See, that's the good thing about my job.
我工作台上的恐龙早就死了012---All the dinosaurs on my table are already dead.
大伙们  我不想罗嗦012---Listen, you guys, um, I don't mean to be a pain about this...
但我发现有些人只是随意盖上012---...but, um, I've noticed that some of you are just placing them on.
你们得用力压笔盖012---You want to push the caps...
直到听见卡的一声012---...until you hear them click.

你想走的话快点走012---Listen, if you want to go, just go.
不  她会骂我的012---No. She'll yell at me again.
好吧  我能把你弄出去012---All right, ahem, I can get you out.
什么012---What?
嘘012---Shh.
一分钟后我会分散她的注意力012---In a minute, I'm gonna create a diversion.
你得趁乱走出去  千万别回头012---When I do, walk quickly to the door and don't look back.
我想我需要喝一杯  我去帮你拿012---I think I need a drink.  Oh, I'll get it for you.
你要喝什么  威士忌012---What do you want?  Scotch.
十秒内我会拿着一杯加冰威士忌回来012---All right, I'll be back in 10 seconds with your Scotch on the rocks in a glass.
纯的012---Neat.
太酷了012---Cool.
纯的  不要加冰块012---Neat, as in no rocks.
我知道012---Heh. I know.
罗斯  你好  你跑到哪里去了012---Oh, hello, Ross. Now, where have you been?
我在厕所里012---Hi. Uh, I have been in the bathroom.
我得将鲑鱼慕斯吐出来012---Ahem. Stay clear of the salmon mousse.
纯威士忌012---Oh. Scotch neat.
瑞秋的爸爸也喝那个012---You know, that's Rachel's father's drink.

我要去拿外套里的烟012---I'm getting my cigarettes out of my jacket.
不  你是什么意思012---No. No. What do you mean "no"?
不行  因为那是准备区012---No, um, see, because that's the staging area.
你跑到那里去  会毁了你对派对的幻想012---You go in there, it'll ruin the whole illusion of the party.
对  拿着你的威士忌回那里去012---Yeah, I think, you take your Scotch back in there...
我去帮你拿烟012---...and I will get your cigarettes for you, sir.

大烟枪012---Big smoker.
超级大烟枪012---Big, big smoker.
事实上我要到走廊  点燃这个坏小子012---In fact, I'm gonna go out into the hallway and fire up this bad boy.
你戴我的眼镜012---Are you wearing my glasses?
对012---Yes.
我只是想帮你暖一下耳垫012---I was just warming up the earpieces for you.
谢谢012---Thank you.
那是我的烟012---Is that one of my cigarettes?
对012---Yeah.

好吧  她要去倒垃圾  我能把你们弄出去012---Okay, okay. She's taking the trash out, so I can get you out of here.

我的朋友呢012---What about my friend Victor?

他们努力工作了一星期  今天是星期六012---You know, they work hard all week. It's Saturday night.
他们需要狂欢  去吧012---They deserve to have a little fun. Go.
我的派对很有趣012---You know, my party is fun.
或许是安静了那么点  不那么明显的乐趣012---I mean, maybe it's a little quieter, less obvious sort of fun.
如果大家愿意给它一个机会  它非常…012---But, you know, if people would just give it a chance, it's...
你要我去看心理医生  甜心  你有问题012---You want me to see a therapist?  Sweetheart, you obviously have a problem.

爸  我真的很想听你说012---Daddy, Daddy, I really want to hear more about this...
但我还有事要做012---...I really do, but I just have to do, uh, some stuff.
我努力经营婚姻012---You work and you work and you work at a marriage...
但他只在乎他的笨船012---...but all he cares about is his stupid boat.
我努力将船弄好012---You work and you work and you work on a boat.
他老是嘲笑我的陶艺课012---He always ridiculed my pottery classes.
帮它打光上漆012---And you sand it and you varnish it.
我用尽所有办法  他还是用马克杯喝东西012---But when all is said and done, he still drinks out of the mugs.
有一晚是她的瑜伽课  跟《麦迪逊之桥》012---One night of her yoga and her Bridges of Madison County...
威士忌  香烟  盆栽  吉娃娃012---Scotch, cigarettes... Bonsais, the Chihuahua...

好吧  你当上衣  我当皮肤012---Okay, okay, okay, you can be shirts and I'll be skins.
我可以当皮肤012---I'll be skins.
嘿012---Hey.
你还好吧  老虎012---How you holding up there, tiger?

钱德  你是怎么撑过来的012---Chandler, how did you get through this?
我做了精心设计的心理治疗012---Well, I relied on a carefully regimented program...
治疗我的否认心态012---...of denial...
跟尿床问题012---...and wetting the bed.
我只是…感觉真的好怪012---You know, I just... It's so weird.
我在那里听他们责备彼此012---I mean, I was in there just listening to them bitch about each other.
脑袋里只想到国庆日012---All I kept thinking about was the Fourth of July.
因为那让你想起012---Because it reminded you of the way...
我们的开国元老如何责备彼此012---...our forefathers used to bitch at each other?
只是每年我们会…012---It's just this thing.
搭我爸的船出海看烟火012---Every year we would go out on my dad's boat and watch the fireworks.
妈非常讨厌那么做  因为海风会将她的头发吹乱012---Mom always hated it because the ocean air made her hair all big.
我妹妹吉儿会趴在船边吐012---My sister Jill would be throwing up over the side...
爸很生气因为没有人帮他012---...and my dad would be upset because nobody was helping.
我们真的去帮他时  他会骂我们做错了012---And then when we did help, he would scream at us for doing it wrong.
但开始放烟火后  大家都会不吭声012---But then when the fireworks started, everybody just shut up.
因为真的很冷012---You know, and it'd get really cold.
我们会一起窝在毯子里012---And we'd all just sort of smoosh under this one blanket.
没有人想过要多带一条毯子012---It never occurred to anybody to bring another one.
现在…012---And now it's...

抱歉  我们吃果馅饼兴奋过头了012---Sorry, we're on a major flan high.
不  你不该在这里012---Oh, no. No, you're not supposed to be here.
这里是准备区  这是不对的  你应该离开012---This is the staging area. It's all wrong. You should leave.
你得离开这里012---Ha, ha. You know, just get out.
或许你想来杯薄荷甜酒012---Or perhaps you'd like a crème de menthe.
我得回我的城堡去  谢谢012---I have to be heading toward my chateau. Thank you.

看起来很像严重感染时涂的药膏012---Kind of looks like that stuff you get when you get a bad infection.
够了012---Okay, that's enough.
瑞秋  许个特别的果馅饼愿望012---Okay, Rachel, make a special flan wish.
我许好了012---Okay, I've got one.

你和在海军服役的人约会012---You went out with a guy in the Navy?
是啊  我在华盛顿广场公园  弹吉他时遇到他012---Yeah, I met him while playing guitar in the park.
雷恩给我太妃糖  因为他没有零钱012---Ryan threw in saltwater taffy because he didn't have change.
嘿  所以你就写了 《太妃糖人》012---Hey, is that when you wrote "Saltwater Taffy Man"?
不是012---No. Heh.
不是  他是我的潜艇人 他每两年就会出水一次012---No, he's my submarine guy. He resurfaces, like, every couple years...
然后我们就会一起度过最棒的三天012---...and we have the most amazing three days together.
只不过这一次  他会来两个星期  整整两个星期  也就是〝耶〞012---Only this time, he's coming for two weeks. Two whole weeks, which means "yay."
等等  这家伙一潜到水底下  就是两年012---So wait, this guy goes down for, like, two years at a time?
这就是舔我的马芬的代价012---That'll teach you to lick my muffin.
嗨012---Hi.

我告诉你  你不必这么做  这又不是营地012---I told you, you don't have to do that. This isn't camp.
所以我猜昨晚偷内裤  是完全不必要的了012---Oh. Then I guess the panty raid last night was totally uncalled for.
好吧  我要去冲个澡012---Okay, I am going to take a shower.
今天我会唱  吉姆克罗齐的《李洛伊布朗》012---And today I will be singing Jim Croce's "Leroy Brown."
摩妮卡012---Monica?
嘿  摩妮卡  我有一个问题012---Hey, Mon, I have a question.
李洛伊是整个镇最坏的人012---Is Leroy the baddest man in the whole damn town...
还是整个镇最胖的人012---...or the fattest man in the whole damn town?
最坏的  否则这首歌  就会是《肥肥李洛伊布朗》012---The baddest. Otherwise, the song would be "Fat, Fat Leroy Brown."
你在做什么012---What are you doing?
我只是在等待着你  亲爱的012---I'm just waiting for you, sweetie.
你在重铺床012---Are you remaking the bed?
对不起  对不起  你知道吗  你弄的根本没问题012---I'm sorry, I'm sorry. You know what? The way you did it, it was just fine.
那你重铺是因为…012---Then you're redoing it because?
如果我告诉你  你会认为我疯了012---If I tell you, you'll think I'm crazy.
反正已经无可避免了012---You're pretty much running that risk either way.
好吧  你看…012---Okay. You see...
棉被的标签不该是在左上角012---...the duvet tag shouldn't be at the top left corner...

好的012---Ha. All right.
好  你有看到这些小花朵吗012---All right, you see these little flower blossoms?
它们应该朝上  不是朝下012---They should be facing up, not down...
因为…好  床头  应该是太阳出来的地方012---...because, well, the head of the bed is where the sun would be.
你不爱我了  对吧012---You don't love me anymore, do you?
其实  如果可能的话  我更爱你012---Actually, if it's possible, I love you more.

我这里就可以给你一份工作  当入门处理员012---...I can get you a job right here as an entry-level processor.
那样的工作不用经验吗012---Don't you need experience for a job like that?
并不是很难学012---It's not that hard to learn.
当人发现你不知道你在做什么时… 嘿  你是演员012---And as for people realizing you don't know what you're doing, hey, you're an actor.
就演得像个处理员  人们就会认为你是一位处理员012---Act like a processor, people will think you're a processor.

我正告诉乔伊关于  佛莱许曼小组的职缺012---I was telling Joey about the opening in Fleischman's group.
佛莱许曼小组012---Fleischman's group.

这是怎么回事012---What's going on?
不…你必须保持距离  我长了痘痘012---PHOEBE: No, no. You have to stay back. I have the pox.
水痘或天花012---Chicken or small?
是水痘  真是讽刺  考虑到你刚从水底出来012---Chicken, which is so ironic considering I'm a vegetarian.
为什么你不在家里的床上  因为我祖母从未得过水痘012---Why aren't you at home in bed?  My grandmother's never had chicken pox.
拜托  拜托  告诉我你得过012---Please, please, tell me you have...

当吉米豪瑟得水痘时…012---...when Jimmy Hauser had chicken pox...
我会抓住那小子  把他抹遍我的脸012---...I would grab that kid and rub him all over my face.
是啊  或是你知道  你可以希望  我现在没有得012---PHOEBE: Yeah, or, you know, you could just wish that I didn't have them now.
我可以看看你的脸吗012---Can I please see your face?
不要  你不会想见到  长了痘痘的脸012---No. You don't wanna see a face covered with pox.
你的脸盖满了鲑鱼  我也不会在意012---Your face could be covered with lox, I wouldn't care.
而你讨厌鱼012---PHOEBE: And you hate fish. Oh.
真好心  好吧012---So sweet. All right.
好吧  你可以看012---Okay, all right. You can see.

我讨厌这样012---I hate this.
我告诉你  我为我们计划了  最棒的两周012---I tell you, I had the most amazing two weeks planned for us.
在我脑海里  我们是比这样更接近的012---And almost everything I had in mind, we had to be a lot closer than this.
菲比  我花了将近八个月的时间  与男人们在钢管中生活012---Phoebe, I've spent the last eight months in a steel tube with men...
一直都在想像这个时刻012---...thinking about this moment.
我不会让一堆…012---I am not gonna let a bunch...
会发痒的斑点挡在我们之间012---...of itchy spots stand between us.
好吧  这是我得过最浪漫的病了012---Okay. This is the most romantic disease I've ever had.

那句话我没有一个字听得懂的012---You know, there isn't a part of that sentence that I don't need explained.
嗯  跟你说  当你在演戏时  你需要思考这样的东西012---Well, see, when you're acting, you need to think about stuff like that.
我的角色  约瑟夫处理员…012---My character, Joseph the processing guy...
有两个小女孩  爱绪莉和布莉塔妮012---...has two little girls, Ashley and Brittany.
爱绪莉重覆布莉塔妮所做的一切012---Ashley copies everything Brittany does.
嗯  无形的孩子  有时是会这样012---Oh. Well, invisible kids can be that way sometimes.
没错  你知道  约瑟夫和他的妻子  凯伦在考虑生第三个孩子012---Yeah, yeah. You know, Joseph and his wife, Karen, are thinking of having a third kid.

是要让我的人休息一下  知道吗  在道德上012---It's about cutting my people a little slack, you know, for morale.
如果你想看一些粗略的数字  我可以让他们在星期三给你012---If you wanna see some rough numbers, I can get them to you by Wednesday.
粗略数字012---Rough numbers?
这家公司可不是用  粗略数字建立的对吧  道格拉斯先生012---This company was not built on rough numbers. Right, Mr. Douglas?
周二把最后的数字  放在我的办公桌上012---Have the final numbers on my desk by Tuesday.

他会拉你一把的012---...he'll call you on it.
他会说〝你想要一把什么〞012---"What are you trying to pull?" he'll say.
胶带012---Ooh. Duct tape.
我也应该带点什么来012---Was I supposed to bring something too?
这是给外面那对抓痒双胞胎的  我用胶带把他们的手捆起来012---This is for the scratchy twins out there. I taped oven mitts to their hands.
你还真严厉012---You're strict.

你知道吗  我喜欢你  把这个标带这样折下去很有效012---You know, I like the way you have efficiently folded this tab under.

天啊  我很喜欢现在  可以在你身边表现得很神经质了012---God, I love that I can be totally neurotic around you now.
跟我说实话012---Tell me the truth. Hmm.
我不觉得现在你桌子上的东西摆成直角后更好些了吗012---Don't you like it better that everything on your desk is perpendicular?
如果不是直角  就是斜角012---If it's not a right angle, it is a wrong angle.

好吧  我糊涂了012---Well, I'm confused.
我们不是一起在共享时间012---I thought we shared time.
没有  没有  你看  我的卧室里我把钟调快了六分钟012---No, no. See, in my bedroom I set my clock six minutes fast.
你想知道为什么012---You wanna know why?
因为要和厨房有点时差012---Because it's in a slightly different time zone than the kitchen?
你知道吗  算了  我不要告诉你  不  快  快告诉我012---You know what? Forget it.  No, come on, come on, tell me.
不  你不明白  不  说吧012---No, you don't understand.  No, come on.

我的男朋友  就没有一件事012---My boyfriend doesn't have a thing.
看  如果有人偷听到  我的名声就完了012---See, if anyone overheard that, I didn't come off well there.
嘿012---Hey.
道格拉斯先生正在找你  为什么道格拉斯先生要找我012---Mr. Douglas is looking for you. Why? Why is Mr. Douglas looking for me?
因为他很怀疑你在贷方项目搞鬼012---Because he has a strong suspicion that you dropped the ball on the Lender project.
为- 为- 为什么他会怀疑012---Why? Why does he suspect that?
因为一开始  他以为是约瑟夫…012---Because at first, he thought it was Joseph...
不过在问过约瑟夫后  就转向你了012---...but after he asked Joseph about it, turns out it was you.
无论如何  我想应该告诉你  好了  够了012---Anyway, I just thought you should know. All right. That's it.
听着  乔伊…012---Look, Joey...
对不起  我知道这是  你一生最棒的角色012---...l'm sorry, I realize this is the role of a lifetime for you...
而如果我可以解雇约瑟夫  我会这么做012---...and if I could just fire Joseph, I would.
但遗憾的是012---But unfortunately that's not possible.
我不得不让你们两个都走012---So I'm gonna have to let both of you go.
你说什么  每个人都喜欢约瑟夫012---What are you talking about? Everybody loves Joseph.
我不喜欢  我恨约瑟夫012---I don't. I hate Joseph.
好吧  我认为他是一个拍马屁的烂人012---Okay, I think he's a brown-nosing suck-up.
哦  是吗012---Oh, yeah?
你不能开除约瑟夫  你知道为什么吗012---Well, you can't fire Joseph. You know why?
他不是在你的部门012---He's not in your department.
好吧…  所以我不能解雇约瑟夫012---All right, okay. All right, so I can't fire Joseph...
不过我可以与他太太上床012---...but, uh, I can sleep with his wife.

我想和她来个一夜情  哦  你知道吗012---I'm thinking about having an affair with her. Oh, you know what?
我刚这么做了012---I just did.
你怎么能这样对我012---What the hell are you doing to me, man?
哦  这不是我012---Oh, it's not me.
这是我的角色012---It's my character.
钱迪012---Chandie.
是啊  这个流氓处理员  专门引诱同事的妻子…012---Yeah, the rogue processor who seduces his coworkers' wives for sport...

事实上  她的内裤  就在我的抽屉里012---In fact, I have her panties right there in my drawer.
真的  不  异想天开  虚构的012---Really? No, freak show, she's fictional!
好啦  放轻松012---Come on! Hey. Take it easy.
如果对你那么重要  我…我会去找别的工作012---If it means that much to you, I'll, uh... I'll go find something else.
谢谢012---Thank you.
只是…我会想念约瑟夫012---It's just that I'm gonna miss Joseph.
我喜欢他  他的妻子012---I liked him. His wife.
她很诱人012---She was hot.
哦012---Ow.
请把这些脱下  我发誓  我不会抓痒012---Please take these off. I swear I won't scratch.
不行  对不起  摩妮卡的命令012---No, sorry, hon. Monica's orders.

因为他帅到不行吗012---Because he was just so darn cute?
不是  是试镜过程的一部分  我想争取的角色…012---No, part of the audition. I'm up for the part of this guy...
我演和他接吻那部分012---...who the main guy kisses.
反正你是演员  咬咬牙就上了吧012---Well, you're an actor. I say you just suck it up and you do it.
或者直接上也行012---Or you just do it.
我亲了  我很专业012---I did do it. I'm a professional.
那问题在哪儿  试镜后…012---What's the problem? After the scene...
比提先生过来找我 他说〝演得好  接吻很烂〞012---...Mr. Beatty comes up to me and he says, "Good actor. Bad kisser."
你们相信吗  居然说我不是接吻高手012---Can you believe that? Me, not a good kisser.

乔伊  也许你不习惯亲男生012---Maybe you're not used to kissing men.
也许你只是太紧张了一点012---Maybe you tensed up a little.
也许那才是你该多练习的012---Maybe you need to work on it.
没错  有道理012---Yeah, that makes sense.

现在012---...now.
真好  我们现在不需要谈论这个012---Well, that's great. We don't need to talk about this now.

你一定很难过012---This must be really tough for you.
我看过一篇文章  上面说婚礼上不该撒米…012---I read this article that says you're not supposed to throw rice at weddings...
因为鸽子吃米会撑死它们的012---...because when pigeons eat rice, it kills them.
难怪寿司店都看不到鸽子012---That's why you never see pigeons in sushi bars.
瞧  我们这不是很开心吗  当然012---See, we're having fun. Oh, absolutely.

你跟我说你什么也没看见  我跟你说过的事多的很012---You told me you didn't see anything.  I tell you a lot of things.
很高兴看到你重新振作起来  亲爱的012---Well, it's wonderful to have you up and about again, dear.

瑞秋  你还在啊012---Oh, Rach. Still here.
上一次婚礼上  他们这时候正在打包碎鹅肝012---At our wedding, they were packing up the chopped liver about now.
真有趣的故事012---Yeah, I love that story.
我有个问题要问你们012---Ahem. I have a question for you guys.
为什么大家一直说  很高兴见到我重新振作起来012---Why do people keep saying it's good to see me up and about?
你逃婚后…012---After you ran out on your wedding...
巴瑞的父母告诉大家你…012---...Barry's parents told people you were sort of...
疯了012---...insane.
疯了  因为得了梅毒012---Insane?  From the syphilis.
什么012---What?
不然你要他们怎么说   你不爱我了  怎么可能012---What were they gonna say? You didn't love me anymore? Come on.

喂   喂012---Hello? Hello?
你要回她吗  她已经叮咚你第十次了012---You gonna answer her? That's the 10th bing-bong message she's sent.

就是这么回事012---That's what's wrong!
我的天啊012---Oh, my.

听着  菲比  我本来也很想跟她碰面012---Look, Phoebe, I wanted to meet her in person too.
但她结婚了  她有丈夫012---But she's married. She has a husband.
如果她丈夫不合适  而你才是合适的人呢012---What if the husband is the wrong guy and you are the right guy?
这种机会不是天天都有012---You don't get chances like this all the time.
如果你不跟她碰面  到80岁时  你会后悔得恨自己012---If you don't meet her, you'll kick yourself when you're 80...
而且这件事难度很高  你会因此跌断屁股012---...which is hard to do and that's how you break a hip.
好吧  我去见她012---Okay. I'll do it.
太好了  快穿鞋  然后走出去见她012---Okay, great! Put on your shoes and then march out there and meet her.
不  等等  你要先洗个澡  因为…012---No, wait! You have to take a shower because ew!
