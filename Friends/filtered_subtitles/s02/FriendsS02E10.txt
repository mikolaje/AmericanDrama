好笑巴比手上永远都有一杯酒012---...I don't think I've ever seen Fun Bobby without a drink in his hand.
对啊012---PHOEBE: Yeah. Ooh, ooh, yeah, you know?
你们有注意到  他故事的开始总是012---Did you notice how he always starts his stories with, um:
〝我当时好醉〞或是 〝我们都喝醉了〞012---"Okay, I was so wasted," or, "Oh, we were so bombed."
又或是〝我醒来时发现我在康州的一个垃圾箱里〞012---Or, um, "So I wake up and I'm in this Dumpster in Connecticut."
摩妮卡  你们约会时他有没有喝过酒012---Monica, have you ever been with him when he wasn't drinking?

去个品酒会  总不能不喝吧012---I mean, how do you go to a wine-tasting without having a drink?

你知道吗  最近你把很多东西都变爱尔兰式的了012---You know, it seems like you've been making an awful lot of stuff Irish lately.
我也可以做比利时式的  但松饼很难塞进酒瓶子里012---I would make them Belgian, but the waffles are hard to get into that flask.
巴比012---Bobby.
好吧012---Yeah, okay.
也许这不关我的事  也许是  我不知道012---Look, maybe this is none of my business, or maybe it is, I don't know.
我有点担心你012---But, um, I'm kind of worried about you.
这不是第一次有人和我提这件事012---Okay, look, this isn't the first time somebody said something to me about this.
我总是找藉口 像〝我只是交际一下〞012---But, I don't know, I always made excuses, like "I'm just a social drinker."
或〝今天是国旗日！〞012---Or "Hey, come on, it's Flag Day."
你想说什么012---So, what are you saying now?
我想说的是…012---I guess I'm saying...
我会试着戒酒012---...I'll try and quit.

菲比  不是  你知道为什么吗  因为他死掉了012---No, Pheebs. You know why? Because he's dead.
不会吧012---Oh, no.
我想这好像有点苦乐参半…012---Okay, I guess this is gonna seem bittersweet now...
是乔伊  就是他012---...but Joey, that's who.
真的  太好了012---Oh, yay! Really?
我经纪人才打来  叫我去《我们的日子》试镜012---My agent just called me with an audition for Days of our Lives.
帅呆了012---Kick ass.
我们得庆祝  应该开个肥皂剧主题派对012---We have to celebrate. We should do a soap opera theme.
对  我们可以一起上床  然后其中一个人要失去记忆012---Hey, yeah. We could all sleep together, and then one of us could get amnesia.
瑞秋  你几点下班  我们今晚有节目012---Rach, what time do you get off? We're all gonna do something tonight.
事实上  我下班了  但是我已经有约了012---Uh, well, actually, I'm already done. Ahem. But I kind of got plans.
你有其他的朋友012---You have other friends?
我有个约会012---Yeah, I, uh... I have a date.

怎么  我有约会很奇怪吗012---What? What is so strange about me having a date?
那罗斯怎么办012---What about Ross?
你还在为列单子的事在跟他生气吗012---Are you still mad at him because he made that list about...?
没有  我才没有生气012---No, no, I'm not mad at him.
我再也不会对他有什么012---I'm not really anything at him anymore.
你在讲什么  我不知道012---What are you talking about? I don't know.
不管我以前怎么感觉  我…现在不了012---Whatever I was feeling, I'm... not.
你们就只差那一步012---But you guys came so close.
我知道  很抱歉  伙计们  你们得习惯…012---Oh, I know. I'm sorry, you guys. You're gonna have to get used to the fact...
我不再和罗斯约会012---...that I will not be dating Ross.
他来了  嗨012---Here he is. Hi.

大家好012---Hi.
不  我不是说你没才华  你非常有才华012---No, no, no. I'm not saying you're not talented. You're very talented.
只是那只鸟死了后  剩下的戏就很少了012---It's just that with the bird dead and all, there's very little act left.
甜心  饶了我吧  我们晚一点联络012---Oh, honey, give me a break, will you? Oh, oh. I'll talk to you later.
我最喜爱的客户012---Well, there's my favorite client.
达令  试镜试得如何012---So tell me, darling, how was the audition?

乔伊  你看过我心醉神迷吗012---Joey. Have you ever seen me ecstatic?
没有  准备好  那你见识看看012---No. Well, here it is.
有件事我想和你谈一谈012---Okay. Uh, listen, there's something I want to talk to you about.
那个选角的女人  罗莉很讨人喜欢吧012---The network casting lady...  Oh, isn't Lori a doll?
对  她很不错012---Yeah, yeah, she's great.
我感觉她好像对我有那么一点点意思012---But I kind of got the feeling that she was sort of coming on to me.
我肯定拿得到那个角色的  如果我  你也知道的012---And I definitely would get the part if I were to, you know...
看我是否要派我的“小将军”出马012---lf I would have sent the little general in. Oh.
知道了  让我打个电话012---I see. Well, I'm just gonna put in a call here...
我们来把事情搞清楚  解决掉012---...and we'll find out what's going on and straighten it out.
喂  麻烦转罗莉012---Yeah, hi. Lori, please.
喂  达令012---Hi, darling.
乔伊·崔比亚尼  当那计程车司机适合吧012---So how about Joey Tribbiani for the part of the cab driver?
他超棒的  对不对012---Isn't he terrific?
啊-哦012---Uh-huh.
好  美女  晚一点再说喽012---Okay, doll, talk to you later.
没错  你得跟她上床012---Yeah, you're gonna have to sleep with her.
怎么啦  好笑巴比012---What's the matter? Fun Bobby.
怎么  他不是戒酒了012---What? Isn't he sober?
他还算清醒012---Oh, he's sober all right.
结果是  好笑巴比  有趣是有原因的012---Just turns out that Fun Bobby was fun for a reason.
知道了012---Ah. Okay.

谢谢  你们想听笑话吗012---Thanks. You wanna hear something funny?
天啊  当然012---Oh, God, yes.
格林威治村过了午夜  五金行就关门了012---There are no hardware stores open past midnight in the Village.
很好笑012---That is funny.
有一晚我得买支铁锤…012---I needed to buy a hammer the other night...
我就在附近逛逛012---...and I'm out walking around the neighborhood.
显然地…012---But apparently...
格林威治村过了午夜所有五金行就关门了012---...there are no hardware stores open past midnight in the Village.

是啊012---Oh, yeah.
再见  拜012---See you guys.Bye...
超级无趣的巴比012---...ridiculously dull Bobby.
我的天  没那么糟啦012---Oh, my God.  He's not that bad.
没那么糟  你没听到那铁锤的故事吗012---Not that bad? Did you not hear the hammer story?
不要那么挑剔就好了012---Okay, okay, don't get all squinky.
也许是要在场才能体会的事012---Maybe it was just the kind of story where you had to be there.
但是我会在场012---But I'm gonna be there.
我下半辈子都会在场012---For the rest of my life.
我没办法跟他分手  是我要他戒酒的012---I can't break up with him. I made him quit drinking.
他因为我而无趣   别这么说012---He's dull because of me.  All right, don't say that.
也许他一直都很无聊   你只是…012---He's probably always been dull. You just, you know...
解放了他012---...set it free.

洛斯没有让你想起某人012---Doesn't Russ just remind you of someone?
鲍伯·萨格特   对哦012---Huh. Bob Saget?  Oh, yeah.

你是她的约会对象012---Oh, you're the date.
这事实上是件好事012---You know, this is actually good...
因为万一我们失去罗斯  还有个备胎012---...because if we ever lose Ross, we have a spare.
你就是那个古生物学家012---Oh. You are the, uh, paleontologist.
是的  我是  而你是…012---Yes. Yes, I am. And you are a...
牙周病专科医师012---Periodontist.
瞧  他们之间的差别简直是黑夜…012---See? Now they're as different as night and...
和更黑的夜012---...later that night.
我去买个饮料012---Well, I am going to, uh, get a beverage. Heh.
很高兴认识你  幸会012---Uh, it was nice, uh, meeting you. Ditto.
我  见过洛斯了012---I, uh... Well, I met Russ.
噢012---Oh.
我不知道我们…边跟别人交往012---Hey, I didn't know we were, uh, seeing other people.
我们之间又没在约会  所以012---Well, we're not seeing each other, so... Huh.
只是让你知道一下  博物馆里有个女人…012---Well, uh, for your information, there's a woman at the museum...
负责蛾类还有其他…012---...who's curator of moths and other, uh...
有翅膀的生物012---...winged things...
她很明显地喜欢我  就像是…012---...who's, uh, let it be known that she is drawn to me, much like a...
你知道的012---...you know. Ahem.
我一直试着保持距离  但如果你是这样…012---Well, so far I've been keeping her at bay, but, uh, if this is the deal...
对  我就要这样012---Yeah, this is the deal.
好  祝你今晚玩得愉快  谢谢012---Okay, well, um, have a nice evening. Thank you.
洛斯  你准备好了吗   好了012---Russ, are you ready? Yeah.
再见  再见012---Bye. Bye.
她在约会012---She's dating?
她在约会012---She's dating?
对  但你看到她在跟谁约会吗012---Yes. Yes, but did you see who she was dating?
什么意思012---What do you mean?
你看不出来  看到什么012---Do you not see it? See what?
我真不知道她看上那呆子哪一点012---I don't know what she sees in that goober.
他需要…不知道012---It takes him, what? Like, I don't know, uh...
一个礼拜来讲完一句话012---...hello, a week to get out a sentence?
很讨厌  对吧012---Yeah, it's annoying, isn't it?
对啊012---Yeah.
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
哇  哇012---Whoa, whoa.
我猜你是没拿到那个角色…012---I'm guessing you didn't get the part...
还是意大利打电话来说它饿了012---...or, uh, Italy called and said it was hungry?
那角色是我的  如果我想要的话012---Well, the part's mine if I want it.
我的天012---Oh, my God.
没错  如果我愿意和选角的女士上床的话012---Yeah. If I'm willing to sleep with the casting lady.
我的012---Oh, my...
天012---...God?
这十年来我一直在等像这样的机会  钱德  十年耶012---Ten years I've been waiting for a break like this, Chandler. Ten years.
我是说“我们的日子”那真的会在电视上播出012---I mean, Days of our Lives. That's actually on television.
你想怎么做012---So, what are you gonna do?
我想我可以和她上床  但是…012---I guess I could sleep with her. I mean...
我怎么能那样做012---How can I do that?
我有本立体书  教我关于性的一切012---Well, I've got a pop-up book that told me everything I needed to know.
我从来没为了一个角色跟人睡过012---I've never slept with someone for a part.
那她是…012---Well, is she...?
抱歉012---Sorry.
她好看吗  是的012---Is she good-looking? Yeah.
她很迷人  如果我在哪个夜店遇上她…012---She's totally good-looking. I mean, if I met her in a bar or something...
我会想给她买早餐012---...I'd be buying her breakfast.
你知道  跟她上床之后012---You know, after having slept with her.
也许这没什么大不了的012---You know, maybe this isn't such a big deal.
依我看  你不但得到一份好工作  还可以跟她上床012---I mean, the way that I see it is, you get a great job and you get to have sex.
你知道  也许再加上一棵树跟胖子就像圣诞树了012---You know? Throw in a tree and a fat guy, and you've got Christmas.
我只是不希望那样得到这份工作  你知道吗012---I just... I just don't think that I want it that way though, you know?
我是说  如果有一天我成名了012---I mean, let's say I do make it, all right?
我会总怀疑那到底是因为我的才华012---I'm always gonna look back and wonder if it was because of my talent...
还是因为  你知道的  我的“小将军”。012---...or because of, you know, the little general.
你以前不是叫它“小少校”的吗012---Didn't you used to call it the little major?
是啊  但在上过丹妮丝·帝马可后  我给它升级了012---Yeah, but after Denise DeMarco, I had to promote it.
两位要不要来一杯酒吗012---Can I get you something from the bar?
好  我要来一杯012---Yes, I would like something.
不要  谢谢012---No. No, thank you.
如果你想喝  我没问题  我得习惯012---No, if you want a drink, it's okay with me. I've gotta get used to it.
不要  说真的  我会觉得不对劲012---No, no, really. I wouldn't feel right about it.
来杯水好了  谢谢012---Just some water, please.
我冰箱的灯熄了  威士忌加冰块跟柠檬皮012---So the light went out in my refrigerator.Scotch on the rocks with a twist.
很抱歉012---I'm sorry.
