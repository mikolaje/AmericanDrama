少来了  幸福家庭养了一只狗012---Come on. Happy family gets a dog.
拓荒者过得很快乐012---Frontier fun!
菲比  结局呢012---Pheebs, what about the end?
老黄狗打败野狼  救了大家  大家都很快乐012---Oh, when Yeller saves the family from the wolf and everyone's happy?
结局不是那样的012---That's not the end.
那时我妈会关掉电视说〝剧终〞012---Yeah-huh. That's when my mother would shut off the TV and say, "The end."
他得了狂犬症那一段呢012---What about when he has rabies?
他没得狂犬症  他是生了宝宝012---He doesn't have rabies. He has babies.
我妈是那么说的012---That's what my mom said.
菲比  我想你妈不希望你看到  接下来要发生的事012---Uh, Phoebe, I don't think she'd want you to see what's about to happen.
为什么  接下来会发生什么事012---Why? What's about to happen?
我没看过这个部分012---I've never seen this part.
嘿  崔维斯  你拿枪做什么012---Hey, Travis, what you doing with that gun?
不012---Oh, no.
不  崔维斯  把枪放下012---No, no, Travis, put down the gun.
不  他是你的好朋友  他是老黄狗012---No, no, he's your buddy. He's your Yeller.
不  剧终012---No! The end! The end!
好吧  这是哪门子的变态狗电影012---Okay, what kind of a sick doggy snuff film is this?
《老友记》 第二季 第20集: 老黄狗的故事012---Friends S02E20: The One Where Old Yeller Dies
你们吃了吗  理查跟我刚吃过  我们有些剩菜012---Have you guys eaten? Uh, Richard and I just finished, and we've got leftovers.
鸡肉跟马铃着012---Chicken and potatoes.
我穿什么012---What am I wearing?
事实上我只戴了橡胶手套012---Actually, nothing but rubber gloves.
总有一天你会真的脱光衣服  但我们不会再冲过来了012---One of these times, you'll really be naked and we won't come over.
我有一条腿  三块胸肉跟一只翅膀012---I got a leg, three breasts and a wing.
你怎么买得到衣服穿012---How do you find clothes that fit?
摩妮卡  我们有个问题012---Oh, hey, Monica? We got a question.
对  我在健身房淋浴间  看到别的女人012---All right, yes, I see other women in the shower at the gym.
不  我不会乱看012---And no, I don't look.
不  不是那个问题012---No, not that one.
我们在想该带谁去看《尼克队》比赛  有多一张票012---We're figuring out who to bring to the Knicks game.
罗斯不能去  我们得在我的口臭朋友 艾力克普洛威012---Ross can't go, so it's between my friend Eric Prower, who has breath issues...
还有爱戳人的丹之间做选择 〝你看到那一球了吗"012---...and Dan, with the poking. "Did you see that play?"
〝还要喝啤酒吗  那是史派克李吗〞012---"You want more beer? Is that Spike Lee?"
好了012---Ha, ha, okay.
你们何不问理查呢012---Why don't you ask Richard?
理查  如果你多了一张《尼克队》门票…012---Uh, Richard, if you had an extra ticket to the Knicks game...
…而你必须在有口臭的朋友…012---...and you had to choose between a friend who smelled...
…跟会戳伤你的朋友之间做选择  你会选谁呢012---...and one who bruises you, who would you pick?
哇012---Wow.
我是超级《尼克队》球迷012---Being a huge Knicks fan myself...
我想你们该选  超级《尼克队》球迷一起去012---...I think you should take someone who's a huge Knicks fan.
好吧012---Okay.
就艾力克了012---That's Eric.
很高兴能帮上忙  我去抽烟012---Glad to be of help. Matches.
我是说你们何不约理查去看球赛012---I meant, why don't you take Richard to the game?
哦012---CHANDLER & JOEY: Eh.
什么012---What?
我不知道  少来了012---I don't know.  Come on!
他不会乱戳人  而且口气清新012---He keeps his fingers to himself, and he's always minty fresh.
理查人不错  但我们跟他不熟012---Richard's really nice. Uh, we just don't know him really well.
而且他很老012---Plus, he's old...
比一些人老012---- er than some people.
但比一些建筑物年轻012---But, uh, younger than some buildings.
那又怎么样  他年纪有点大  没什么大不了的012---So what, he's a little older. Big deal.
他对我来说很重要012---He's important to me.
如果你们问他  或许他会开捷豹跑车载你们去012---If you ask him, he might take you in his Jag.
我们要怎么答应她012---How do we say yes...
同时装做我们不是为了想搭跑车012---...and make it seem like it's not just to ride in the cool car?
好吧  这可能有点难012---Okay, this could be tough.
好吧  摩妮卡012---Okay, okay, okay. Monica?
我们可以带他去  但他一定开捷豹跑车012---We'll bring him, but only if he takes the Jaguar.
你差点就成功了012---Ooh, you almost had it.
不  尿布没脏012---No, no, you're fine. You're fine.
哈罗  嘿012---Hello, ha, ha. Hey.
甜心012---Hi, honey. Oh.
你们不会相信发生了什么事012---You are not gonna believe what happened!
我们在地上玩  他抓住桌子012---We were playing on the floor, and he grabs the table...
自己站起来012---...and he pulls himself up!
他自己站起来012---He pulled himself up!
他站起来了012---Standing man!
我很遗憾你们错过了  如果你们想看  我都拍下来了012---I'm sorry you missed it, but I did tape it if you wanna see it.
我们知道  上星期他就会那么做012---Uh, we know. He already did it last week.
如果你要的话  你可以看我们的录影带012---You can watch our tape if you want.
听着  我不敢相信  我错过所有的第一次012---Ah, see, I don't believe this. I missed the first time of everything.
他第一次翻身跟爬行012---The first time he rolled over, the first time he crawled.
还有什么  他会说话或开车吗012---What else? Has he spoken? Is he driving?
他有最喜欢的酒类饮料吗012---Does he have a favorite liqueur?
他就快会说话了012---He is getting closer on the talking thing.
他还不会叫妈妈  但有一次他说〝阿姆〞012---He can't quite say "mama" yet, but once he said "Yemen."
我不知道  我厌倦了老是在错过012---See, I don't know. I'm so sick of missing stuff.
我不只要陪他一天  我要陪他一整个周末012---I want him for more than a day. I want him for a whole weekend.
听着  我认为…012---Listen. I feel...
那应该会很棒012---That would be great.
真的吗  我准备了一大套台词012---Really? I had a whole speech prepared.
真可惜  应该很有趣012---Oh, shoot, that would've been fun.
你们看到了吗012---Oh, look, did you just see that?
你们看到了吗  他挥手了012---Did you see? He just waved! He just waved!
他不曾挥过手012---He's never waved before!
对  他挥过手  太棒了012---Yes, he has. Very good.
嘿  嘿  菲比  你买了什么012---Hey.  Hey, Pheebs. What you got there?

加上《杀戮战场》012---Wow, all you need now is The Killing Fields...
跟一些酪梨酱  你就可以办派对了012---...and some guacamole, and you got yourself a party!
我跟我外婆聊到《老黄狗》的事012---I talked to my grandma about the Old Yeller incident...
她说我妈不让我们看悲伤电影结局012---...and she said my mom used to not show us the ends of sad movies...
不希望我们接触到痛苦与悲伤012---...to shield us from the pain and sadness.
知道吗  就在她自杀前012---You know, before she killed herself.
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
理查在哪里  你们甩了他012---Where's Richard? Did you ditch him?
在我们偷了他的午餐钱  还拉他的内裤之后012---After we stole his lunch money and gave him a wedgie.
怎么了  他去停车012---What's the matter with you? He's parking the car.
你们玩得开心吗   你男朋友太酷了012---Did you guys have fun?  Your boyfriend is so cool.
他让我们闻他的捷豹跑车  乔伊开了12条街  我是15条街012---He let us drive his Jaguar. Joey for 12 blocks. Me for 15.
哇012---Wow.
他一定最喜欢你012---He must like you best.
他给带位员小费那一段呢012---Oh, what about when he tipped the guy who showed us to our seats?
根本没看到他拿出钱012---You never even saw the money.
钱德  谢谢你帮我们带位012---Hey, Chandler, thanks for showing us to our seats.
不客气  乔伊  谢谢你帮忙停车012---Ha, ha, you're welcome. Hey, Joey, thanks for parking the car.
不客气012---No problem, ha, ha.
钱德  我想她们了解了012---Hey, Chandler... I think they get it.
大英雄来了012---There's the man!
嘿012---Hey.
你越来越厉害了012---Hey, you're getting better. Huh? Ha, ha.
我要留下这个012---I'm gonna keep this.

他把我的钱拿走了012---He kept my dollar.
你们第一次离开班去度周末  你们要做什么012---Your first weekend without Ben. What are you doing?
我们要去参观殖民时期的威廉斯堡012---Ah, we're going to colonial Williamsburg.
我念大学时认识的一个女孩  是那里的第一位女铁匠012---A woman I went to college with is the first female blacksmith there.
殖民时期的威廉斯堡  有点跟不上时代012---They're a little behind the times in colonial Williamsburg.
听着  我得走了  不然妈妈要哭了012---Ha, ha. Well, look, I better go before Mommy starts weeping.
我们爱你  再见  妈妈012---We love you.  Bye, Mommy.
好好玩吧012---Have a good time.
好吧  小班012---Okay, Ben.
罗斯  什么012---Ross. Yeah?
快看012---Look.
乔伊  你知道我们在这里能看到你吗012---Joey, do you know we can see you from here?
为什么理查这么做就是比我酷012---How come Richard looks cooler with one of these?
或许你得先点雪茄  然后放下铲子012---You may wanna light it and lose the spatula.
那真的很可爱  你试着模仿理查012---It's cute, you trying to be more like Richard.
我不是在学他012---Not like him, per se.
只是不想跟他不一样012---Just not unlike him.
他是之前名为钱德的艺人012---It's the artist formerly known as Chandler.
我是在尝试新造型012---I'm just trying something here, you know?
为什么你不留胡子012---Why didn't you grow a mustache?
我们丢铜板决定012---Oh, we flipped for it.
我抽到雪茄  他抽到胡子012---I got the cigar, he got the mustache.
如果我们两个都留胡子  看起来会很像呆瓜012---If we both grew them, we'd look like dorks.
你们真的不像呆瓜012---You really sidestepped that land mine.
我答应理查到楼下跟他碰面012---I promised Richard we'd meet downstairs.
你们跟理查有约012---You're meeting Richard?
游骑兵队》比赛  他没跟你说吗012---Ranger game.  Didn't he tell you?
他说他要跟朋友出去  我不知道他是指你们012---He said he was going out with the guys. I didn't know that was you.
你听到了吗012---You hear that?
我们是朋友 我们是朋友012---We're the guys!  We're the guys!
他留胡子的样子  让你想起席薇亚阿姨012---With that mustache, he reminds me of Aunt Sylvia.
没错012---Thank you!
嗨  我们来了012---Hi, we're visiting. Yay.
小班跟爸爸012---It's Ben and his dada.
爸爸012---Dada.
你会叫爸爸吗012---Can you say "dada"?  Aw.
我跟你的妈妈们说你会说  所以你非说不可012---I'm telling your mommies you said it, so you might as well.
运气不好  没错012---No luck, huh?  No.
刚刚我听到他说二012---A while ago, I got a "seh" out of him...
我以为他是说第二照顾者  可是…012---...which I thought might turn into "seh-condary caregiver," but...
你能帮我抱抱他吗  我得把包包放好012---Would you, uh, hold him for a sec? I gotta take this off.
好的  没问题012---Oh, yeah, sure, okay. There we go.
你在做什么012---What are you doing?
我在抱小班012---I'm holding Ben.
对  他是小宝宝  不是炸弹012---Yeah, well, he's a baby, not a bomb.
好的012---Okay.
像抱足球一样抱着他012---Hold him like you'd hold a football.
我都是这样抱足球的012---This is how I would hold a football.
来吧  好了012---Here. Here. There we go.
抱歉  我不太会带小孩  我一直跟小孩没什么接触012---Sorry, I'm not very good with babies. I haven't been around them.
我是说从我一岁后012---I mean, you know, since I was one. Ha, ha.
没关系  没什么大不了的  真的吗012---It's all right. No big deal. Really?
我相信我们生了孩子后  你会有不一样的想法012---You'll feel different when it's our baby.
什么  什么012---What?  What?
你想过那种事了012---You think about stuff like that?
对  我是说…012---Uh, yeah. I mean...
事实上我想我们得生两个012---Actually, I kind of think that we'll have two babies.
生两个012---Two babies?
你知道的  一男一女012---You know, a boy and a girl.
我希望先生女儿  小班才不会有竞争压力012---Hopefully, the girl will come first, so Ben won't feel competitive.
之后呢012---Then what's gonna happen?
我们不想让孩子们在城市里长大  所以我们会搬到史卡戴尔012---We won't wanna raise kids in the city, so we'll move to Scarsdale.
史卡... 嗯-哼012---Scar... Uh-huh.
我们可以远离我们的爸妈  不必看到他们012---We'll be far enough from our parents so we don't have to see them...
但距离也够近  他们能来当褓姆012---...but close enough that they can babysit.
对  我知道税率比拿索郡高012---And yes, I know the taxes are a little higher than Nassau County...
但学区非常不错012---...but the school system's great.
哇  哈哈012---Wow! Ha, ha.
那真的太棒了012---Wow, that's great! Great!
好吧  你知道吗012---Okay, wow! You know what? Hmm?
我的休息时间结束了012---I'm off my break now. So, uh...
来吧  你抱着他012---Um, here. You take this.
还有  恩...012---And, um...
我要去帮这些非常好的人倒咖啡012---I'm gonna go pour these very nice people some coffee.
好吧012---Okay.
看吧  我没拿咖啡壶012---Look at that. I don't have a pot.
我没拿咖徘壶  或许我把咖啡壶放在家里012---I don't have a pot. Maybe I've got one at home.
或是放在史卡戴尔了  那是门吗012---Or in Scarsdale. Hey, is that a door?
瑞秋012---Rach.
嘿  菲比  怎么样啊012---Hey. Hey, Pheebs. What's happening?
杀人  癌症  足球队在安地斯山脉吃掉彼此012---Oh, okay, murder, cancer, soccer teams eating each other in the Andes.
你看了电影012---You watched the movies? Uh-huh.
这个世界是怎么了012---What is happening to the world?
我是说…不  因为E.T.离开了012---I mean... No, no, because E.T. Leaves...
洛基输了  夏绿蒂死了012---...and Rocky loses. Charlotte dies.
哪个夏绿蒂012---Charlotte who?
织网的那个  蜘珠夏绿蒂012---With the web. The spider.
他死了  他生下宝宝后就死了012---She dies. She has babies and dies.
那像是〝欢迎出院回家〞 然后他死了012---It's like, "Welcome home from the hospital." Thud!
你想得开心点吗012---You wanna feel better?
对  好吧012---Yeah.  Okay.
拿去吧  看这个012---Here. Watch this.
《风云人物》  我听过这部电影012---It's a Wonderful Life. Yes, I've heard of this.
你一定会喜欢  片名说明了一切012---So you can't lose. It's there in the title.
剧情保证美好012---Wonderfulness is baked right in.
我被《洋基之光》骗了012---I fell for that with Pride of the Yankees.
我以为电影描述《洋基队》的光荣012---I thought I'd see a film about Yankee pride.
结果是主角得了路贾里格症012---And boom! The guy gets Lou Gehrig's disease.
主角就是路贾里格  你没发现吗012---Uh, the guy was Lou Gehrig. Didn't you kind of see it coming?
看一下那部电影  它会让你恢复对人性的信心012---Watch that. It'll restore all your faith in humanity.
嘿  大英雄  比赛时间012---Hey, big guy. Game time.
嘿  马上到  有比赛012---Hey! Be right there! There's a game?

是篮球季后赛012---It's the basketball playoffs.
我真的很高兴  但你不必看在我的面子上陪他们012---Um, I appreciate this, but you don't have to hang out with them for me.
他们有彼此的陪伴012---They have each other.
不  甜心  别担心012---Oh, no, honey. I mean, don't worry.
我喜欢跟他们在一起  他们跟我其他的朋友不一样012---I like hanging out with them. They're different than my other friends.
他们不会一开始就说 〝你知道谁在铲雪时死掉了吗〞012---They don't start sentences with "You know who just died shoveling snow?"
好吧  太棒了  快去吧012---All right, that's great. Then just go.
加油  《尼克队》012---Go Knicks!
是大学篮球季后赛012---Uh, it's the college playoffs. Oh.
那么加油  瓦萨学院  他们没有晋级季后赛012---Then, go Vassar! Uh, they're not in it.
好吧  那么快去吧  好的012---Okay, then just go.  Okay.
为什么我觉得很困扰012---Ugh, why does this bother me so much?
我不是那种想每天24小时  都黏在一起的人012---I'm not one of those people who wants to spend 24 hours a day together.
当然012---Sure.
只是他的空闲时间不多  我该怎么办012---He just doesn't have much free time. What do I do?
那重要吗  反正你会死掉  离婚或轰掉宠物的头012---Does it matter? You'll just die or divorce or blow your pet's head off.
我也是012---Ugh! Me too!
瑞秋  我有个问题  理查又跟他们做计划了…012---Rachel, I got a question. Richard made plans again with the guys...
罗斯计划了整个世纪012---Ross made plans for the century.
我要去看女性杂志  或许里面提供了一些好方法012---I'm gonna go read Cosmo. Maybe there's something helpful in it.

前一分钟我像抱足球一样抱着小班  后来发现我会有两个孩子012---One minute I'm holding Ben, then I've got two kids...
住在史卡戴尔  抱怨税率问题012---...l'm living in Scarsdale complaining about taxes!
对不起  我会想很多事012---Well, I'm sorry. I think about stuff.
我在工作  组合骨头  思绪开始奔腾012---You're at work, you're assembling bones, your mind wanders.
你为未来二十年做计划  我们才开始交往六星期012---You've planned out the next 20 years. We've dated for six weeks!
难道你没想过我们的未来吗012---You never think about our future?
对  我会想明天要到谁家过夜012---I think about whose apartment we'll sleep at tomorrow...
下星期六要到哪里吃晚餐012---...and where we'll have dinner next Saturday!
我不会去想我们孩子的名字012---I do not think about our children's names!
你知道我们孩子的名字012---You know what our children's names will be?
哈哈  不知012---Ha, ha, no.
不  我看过一本书  里面有个女孩叫艾蜜莉012---No, I mean, you know. I read a book, and there was a girl named Emily.
我觉得那会是个好名字012---And I thought that might be good.
哪本书012---What was the book?
《儿童命名宝典》012---The Big Book of Children's Names.
好吧  罗斯012---Okay. Ross, Ross.
听我说012---Okay, listen.
我们的关系非常棒  对012---What we have is amazing.
但我不要别人帮我决定人生012---But I do not want everything decided for me!
我一直都过着那样的生活012---I spent my whole life like that.
巴瑞跟我就是那样  所以我才会离开012---It's what I had with Barry. That's a reason I left.
现在我不想那样012---I like not knowing right now.
抱歉吓到你了  但想跟我在一起  你就得接受012---Sorry if that scares you, but if you wanna be with me, deal with that!
好吧  谢谢012---Okay, fine! Thank you!
我还没有说完  我不知道012---We're not done! I didn't know that.
跟你在一起的男人 一直在计划他跟你的未来012---You're with a guy who won't stop planning his future with you.
他知道我们一定会在一起012---He knows we'll end up together.
如果那吓坏了你  你必须接受012---If that scares you, tough! You'll have to deal with that.
我会的  很好  因为我爱你012---I will! Good, because I love you!
是吗  我也爱你012---Oh, yeah? I love you too!
那是我们第一次那么说  对012---That's the first time we've said that!  Yes.
我要吻你  快来吧012---I'm gonna kiss you!  You better!
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
谢谢你推荐的电影012---Oh, thanks for the great movie tip.

我不知道我比较喜欢  乔治巴里毁了家族企业012---I don't know if I was happier when George Bailey destroyed the business...
还是唐娜里德哭泣  或药剂师害他的耳朵流血012---...or, um, Donna Reed cried or when the pharmacist made his ear bleed.
我能了解你不喜欢耳朵那一段  但结局不是很棒吗012---I'll give you the ear thing, but wasn't the ending wonderful?
我没看完  我太沮丧了012---I didn't watch it. I was too depressed.
剧情越来越可怕  它应该叫：012---It kept getting worse! It should've been called:
《去他的鬼人生 你不会相信人生就是这么惨》012---"It's a Sucky Life, And Just When You Think It Can't Suck Anymore, It Does!"

我们的爸爸还不错  但理查是…012---Our dads are okay and all, but Richard is just...
你干嘛踢我012---Ow, ow, ow. What are you kicking me for?
我在说话012---Huh? I'm trying to talk here.
你们把我当成爸爸012---Uh, you guys see me as a dad?
对  不012---Oh, yeah.  No!
不012---No.
显然你不了解年轻人的辞汇012---You're just clearly not familiar with our young persons' vernacular.
我们说〝爸爸〞  事实上是指 〝好兄弟〞012---When we say "dad," we mean "buddy."

过来012---Come here.
我会让你变年轻012---I'll make you feel like one of the guys.

嗨…012---Hi. Hi?
比较像是嗨012---You know, actually, it's more like, hi!
嗨嗨012---- Hi? - Hi.
嗨   嗨012---Hi.  Hi.
这可能得花点时间012---This could go on for a while.

小班  这时厄尼把柏特埋在沙里  然后找不到他012---Ben, this is the part where Ernie buries Bert in the sand and can't find him.
我用快转看过录影带  后来他又找到他012---Now, I've looked ahead on the tape, and he does find him again.
在那之前  发生了一些不好的事012---But before that happens, there's some rough going for a while.
我想我们应该可以应付012---But I think we can handle it.
还有字母歌  我们知道结局一定会很快乐012---And there's just the alphabet, but we know that ends well, so...
来吧012---Here we go.
柏特  柏特012---Bert? Bert?
