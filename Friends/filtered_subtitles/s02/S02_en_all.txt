Friends S02E01: The One With Ross' New Girlfriend
Flight number 457 from Beijing now arriving.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my... Excuse me. Move, move, move! Emergency, please!
Excuse me, excuse me.
Rach! Ah!
There you are!
Hey!  Hi!
Oh! So, so.
How was China? You!
It was... It was great. Oh, what happened?  What?
You're bleeding. I am?
God.  Oh, look at that! Yes, I am. Heh.
Enough about me, Mr. Back From The Orient!
Come on, I wanna hear everything. Everything!
Well, uh, where do I start? Um...
This is Julie. Uh, Julie, this is Rachel.
Hi. Heh.
Uh, oh! These are...
These are... Aren't for you. Oh.
Heh. Uh, these are for you.
Welcome to our country.
Thank you. I'm from New York.
Well, not a problem. We'll use them to stop the bleeding.
Okay. Uh, baggage claim?
Okay. Okay.
No way. I'm telling you, she went to the airport.
And she's gonna go for it with Ross.
Oh, my God. This is huge. This...
This is bigger than huge. This is...
All right, what's bigger than huge?
Um, this?  Yes.
Guys, you got new haircuts!
Yes, yes, we did. Thanks to Vidal Buffay.
Because, you know: "If you don't look good, we don't look good."
I love that voice! Ha, ha.
You guys! Oh, oh.
Airport. Airport. Ross. Not... Not alone.
Julie. Arm around her!
Unh! Cramp! Cramp! Cramp!
Okay, I think she's trying to tell us something.
Quick, get the verbs.
Ow. You! You!
You said he liked me! You! You...!
You slowpokes!
That's all right, Rach. We got the bags. Uh...
Hi. Hello.
Julie, this is my sister, Monica. This is Chandler.
Hey. Phoebe, hi. Mwah.
Joey, what up?  Hey.
Everyone, this is Julie. Julie.
ALL: Oh.
Hi! Hi!
Hi! But I'm not here, you haven't met me.
I'll make a better impression when I don't have 20 hours of plane on me.
And bus. Oh, my God!
With the screaming guy... And the spitting.
You gotta hear this story.
We're on this bus that's 200 years old.
Two hundred, at least.
And this guy... And the chicken poops in her lap! Ha!
Oh, I'm so sorry.
I just gave away the ending, didn't I?
Ugh, I just heard this story in the cab...
...and it is all I can think about.
This is amazing. I mean, how...?
How did this happen?  Ross and I were in grad school together.
We haven't seen each other since then. I land in China...
...guess who's in charge of the dig?
Julie!
Julie. Isn't that great?
Isn't that just kick-you-in-the-crotch, spit-on-your-neck fantastic?
It's an expression.
We just wanted to say a quick hi.
Then we're gonna go see the baby. Then get some sleep.
Yeah, it's 6:00 tomorrow night, our time.
Well don't tell us what's gonna happen, though Because I like to be surprised.
Bye!  Bye.
Rach. Can I get some coffee?
Sure. Thank you.
Hey, Rach... Did you talk to him yet?  No.
Then, no.
So, what the hell happened to you in China?
I mean, when last we left you, you were in love with, you know.
I know. I know I was.
But there was always this voice inside that kept saying:
"It's never gonna happen. Move on." You know whose voice that was?
God?
It was you, pal.
Well, maybe it was God doing me.
You were right. She looks at me and sees a friend. That's all.
And then I met Julie, and... I don't know. We're having a great time.
I never would have gone for it with her, if it hadn't been for you.
Well, you owe me one, big guy.
Here's your lemonade.
I didn't order lemonade.
Oh. Well then you better go take that back. They're gonna charge you for that.
But... Go, go, go! Come on, come on!
Okay, so, uh, what did you find out?
He said...
He said they're having a great time. - I'm sorry. - What?
But the silver lining, if you wanna see it...
...is that he made this decision all by himself...
...without any outside help whatsoever.
How is that a silver lining?
You have to really wanna see it.
Ironically, these guys were picked last in gym.
Hey, Pheebs.
You know what I'm thinking? Oh, okay.
How...
...it's been so long since you've had sex...
...you're wondering if they've changed it?
No. Although now that's what I'm thinking.
So, what were you thinking?
I was thinking you gave the guys great haircuts. I thought you'd like to do mine.
Oh! No.
Why not? Because I'm just...
I'm incredibly anal and an unbelievable control freak.
No, you're not. I know I'm not, but you are.
I was trying to spare your feelings.
Hello? Oh, hi.
Yeah, hold on a second. Ross, Julie for you.
Hello? Hi.
Hey. Anybody know a good tailor?
You need clothes altered? No, no.
I'm just looking for a man to draw on me with chalk.
Go see Frankie. My family's been going to him forever.
He did my first suit when I was 15. No, wait, 16.
No, excuse me, heh, 15.
All right, when was 1990?
Okay, you have to stop the Q-Tip when there's resistance.
Okay. Okay. Sweetheart, I'll see you later.
Okay, bye. What?
Oh, that is so sweet.
No... Ha, ha.
No. Okay. No, you hang up.
No, you... Okay. Okay.
One, two, three. Shh.
Well you didn't hang up either.
She didn't hang up.
Okay, no.
No, you hang up.
You. You. Yo...
Sorry, I thought you were talking to me.
Rachel. Heh. Sorry.
I'll just call her back. Okay.
Hi, sweetie. I'm sorry. We got disconnected.
No, you hang up.
Okay, okay, okay. How did this happen to me? How?
A week ago, two weeks ago, I was fine.
Ross was just Ross. Just this guy.
Now all of a sudden, he's Ross...
...ugh, this really great guy that I can't have.
Sweetie, I wanted you to have him too.
I know you did.
Ugh. I'm just gonna deal with it. I'm just gonna deal with it
I gotta get out of here!
I don't care what you guys say. Something's bothering her.
You know, I think I was 16.
Please, just a little bit off the back.
Um, I'm still on "no."
Uh, morning. Hey.
Could you close your eyes for a sec?
Oh, no, no, no. I'm not falling for that again.
What's going on? I sort of did a stupid thing last night.
What stupid thing did you do?
Why don't you just go get dressed... ...then you'll be on your way. Bye-bye.
Rachel, how did this happen?
I don't know, I kind of ran into him last night.
Where?  At his apartment. Is this juice?
Whoa. And the fact that you dumped him because he hit on Phoebe?
Oh, God, I know. I'm pathetic, I'm a loser.
Honey, you're not pathetic. You're just sad.
Yeah. People do stupid things when they're upset.
My God, if I had a nickel for every guy I wish I hadn't...
But this is about your horrible mistake.
Hi. Hey!
Hi... Sorry we're late.
We were, uh...
Well, there was touching.
Hey, Ross! Paolo. Ha.
What a...
What, uh...? What are you doing here?
I do Raquel. Ah.
So, uh, he's back?
Yeah, he's back. Is that a problem?
No, not a problem.
Good. Glad it's not a problem.
Okay, you're gonna have to not touch my ass.
Well, despite the yummy bagels and palpable tension...
...I've got pants that need to be altered.
Oh, when you see Frankie, tell him Joey Tribbiani says hello.
He'll know what it means.
You sure he's gonna be able to crack that code?
It's funny. The last time Paolo was here, my hair was so much shorter and cuter.
All right. Okay.
But... But! You have to promise that you will not be all controlly and bossy...
...and all, you know, Monica about it.
I promise. All right, let's see.
Now, some of you are gonna get cut and some of you aren't.
But I promise, none of you will feel a thing.
Okay.
All right, that's it. I quit. What? I didn't say anything!
Yeah, but this isn't the face of a person who trusts a person.
This is the face of a person who, you know...
...doesn't trust a person.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Phoebe.
It's just a little shorter than what we had discussed.
Would you relax? I know what I am doing.
This is how he wears it.
How who wears it? Demi Moore.
Heh. Demi Moore is not a he.
Well, he was a he in Arthur and in 10.
That's Dudley Moore!
I said I wanted it like Demi Moore!
Oh. Oh! Oh, my God!
Oh, God! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
Which one is Demi Moore?
She's the actress that was in Disclosure, Indecent Proposal, Ghost!
Oh, she's got gorgeous hair. I know!
Oh, my God!
How long do you want the cuffs? At least as long as I have the pants.
I just got that.
Okay. Now we'll do your inseam.
How is she? It's too soon to tell.
She's resting, which is a good sign.
How's the hair? I'm not gonna lie to you, Ross.
It doesn't look good.
I put a clip on one side, which seems to have stopped the curling.
Can we see her?
Your hair looks too good. It would upset her.
Ross, why don't you come on in.
Well, how you doing? I'm okay.
Ooh, that bad, huh?  What?
Look, I can sense when women are depressed and vulnerable.
It's one of my gifts. Sit.
Ugh, Joey, when I saw him get off that plane with her...
...I really thought I just hit rock bottom.
But today, it's like there's rock bottom...
...50 feet of crap...
...then me.
You gotta tell Ross how you feel.
Oh, come on, how can I just tell him? What about Julie?
What about her? They've only been going out for two weeks.
Ross has been in love with you for 10 years.
I don't know. I don't know. Look, Rach, Rach.
I've been with my share of women.
I've been with a lot of people's share of women.
But the point is...
...I've never felt about anyone the way Ross felt about you.
Really?
Yo, paisan.
Can I talk to you for a sec?
Your tailor...
...is a very bad man!
Frankie? What are you talking about?
Hey, what's going on?
Joey's tailor...
...took advantage of me.
What? No way.
I've been going to the guy for 12 years.
Oh, come on. He said he was gonna do my inseam.
Then he ran his hand up my leg and then there was definite...
What?
Cupping.
That's how they do pants!
First they go up one side, they move it over.
Then they go up the other side, move it back, then they do the rear.
What? Ross, tell him. Isn't that how a tailor measures pants?
Yes, yes, it is. In prison!
What's the matter with you?
What?
That's not?
Oh, my God.
Even Mary Tyler Moore would've been better.
I like it.
Yeah, I do. I think it's a 10!
Thank you.
My hair is very amused.
Oh, come on, things could be worse. I mean, uh...
You could "get caught between the moon and New York City.
I know it's crazy, but it's true."
Thank you.
Well, I gotta go. Bye. See you.
Bye, Rach!  Wait, are you leaving?
That's what I meant by "bye."
Well, uh, can I talk to you for a sec?  Okay.
When the doctor does that hernia test...
That's okay.
What's going on? Um...
Well, um, okay, first of all... Mm-hm.
...Paolo and I are not back together.
That was a stupid thing I did.
If I could go back in time and do it again...
...well, I wouldn't.
Second of all...
What?
OK.
Before I say anything I just need to know...
...is this one of those things where you break up with a guy.
Then I tell you what I think... ...and the next day you get back together with him...
...and I look like a complete idiot?  No, no, no.
Okay.
Um, well, then, I think the guy's scum.
I hate him. I mean, I actually... I physically hate him.
You know? I always have.
And you are way too good to be with a guy like that.
Really? Rach?
You deserve to be with someone who appreciates you...
...and who gets how funny... ...and sweet and amazing...
...and adorable and sexy you are.
You know? Someone who wakes up every morning thinking:
"Oh, my God. I'm with Rachel!" Heh.
You know? Someone who makes you feel good.
Like the way I do with Julie.
Was there a "second of all"?
No, um, I think that was the whole "all."
I gotta go. Okay?
Okay. Thanks.
Okay.
No, I swear to God, Dad! That's not how they measure pants!
I was thinking of doing it shorter, like Andie MacDowell's haircut.
Oh, yeah. Oh, I could do that. Really?
Yeah. You wanna do it now?  Great!
Okay. Okay.
See you.
Okay, I just wanna make really sure this time. Uh-huh. Ahem.
Andie MacDowell is the girl from Four Weddings and a Funeral, right?
No.
No, no, no, no, no, no. That's Roddy McDowall.
Andie MacDowell is the guy from Planet of the Apes.
Oh! Yeah, okay. Yeah. Okay?
Thank you.  You're welcome.
Okay, these were expensive, and he's gonna grow out of them...
...in 20 minutes, but I couldn't resist!
Look at these.
Hey, Ben.
"Just do it"! Unh!
Oh, my God! Oh!
Was that too much pressure for him?
Oh, is he hungry already? Aw. I guess so.
You know, it's...
Something funny about sneakers. I'll be right back.
Oh, uh, I gotta get one too.
Hey, what are you guys doing?
We're just hanging out by the spoons.
Ladle?
Will you guys grow up?
This is the most natural, beautiful thing in the world.
Yeah, we know. But there's a baby sucking on it.
This is my son having lunch, okay? It'll happen a lot, so get used to it.
If you have a problem, if you're uncomfortable, just ask questions.
Carol's fine with it. Come on.
Carol?  Carol.
I was wondering if Joey could ask you a question about breast-feeding?
Sure.  Uh...
Does it hurt?
It did at first, but not anymore.
Chandler?
So, uh, how often can you do it?
As much as he needs.
Oh, okay, I got one, I got one. Uh...
If he blows into one, does the other one get bigger?
Friends S02E02: The One With the Breast Milk
Rachel, do you have muffins left? Yeah, I forget which ones.
Oh, you're busy, I'll get it.
Anyone else want one? No, thanks.
No, I'm all set.
Oh, you're losing your apron. Let me get it.
Oh. There you go.
Thank you.
Ugh, what a bitch.
Listen, guys, I have a friend at Bloomingdale's who's quitting...
...and he wants to abuse his discount.
So anyone want to come take advantage of it?
I can't. I have to take my grandmother to the vet.
Okay. Um, I'll go with you. Great.
Hi, honey.  Hey, sweetums.
And hello to the rest. Hi.
What are you doing?
You can't go shopping with her. What about Rachel?
It's gonna be a problem, isn't it? Come on.
You're going to Bloomingdale's with Julie.
It's like cheating on Rachel in her house of worship.
But I... Monica, she will kill you.
She will kill you like a dog in the street!
So, uh, Jules tells me you guys are going shopping tomorrow.
Yeah, um, it's actually not that big a deal. In fact...
It's a big deal to me. This is great. I really appreciate this.
You're welcome.
Bijan for men?
Bijan for men?
Hey, Annabel. Hey, Joey.
Did you hear about the new guy? Who?
Nobody knows his name. Me and the girls call him "The Hombre Man."
Hombre?
What's he doing in my section?
I guess he doesn't know.
Well, he's gonna.
I'll see you a little later, okay?
Hey, how you doing?
Morning.
Listen, uh, heh. I know you're new...
...but, uh, it's kind of understood that everything...
...from young men's to the escalator is, uh, my territory.
Your territory, huh? Yeah.
Bijan for men? No, thanks.
Hombre?
Yeah, all right.
You were saying?
Phoebe, listen. You were with me, and we were shopping all day.
What? We were shopping and we had lunch.
All right. What did I have?
You had a salad. No wonder I don't feel full.
Hi, guys. What's up?
I went shopping with Monica all day and I had a salad.
Good, Pheebs. What'd you buy?
We went shopping for, um...
For, um...
For fur.
You went shopping for fur? Yeah.
And then I realized that I'm against that and, um...
So then we bought some, um...
Um, boobs.
You bought boobs?
Bras!
We bought bras!
We bought bras.
Bijan for men?
Bijan for...
Hey, Annabel. Uh...
Listen, I was wondering if after work we could grab a cup of coffee?
Actually, I sort of have plans.
You ready, Annabel?
You bet.
Maybe some other time. Yeah.
It's not the first time I lost a girl to a cowboy spraying cologne.
Bijan for men?
Bijan for men!
Okay, and this is Funny Clown.
Funny Clown is only for after his naps, not before or he won't sleep.
We've been through this before. We have a good time.
We laugh, we play. It's like we're father and son.
Honey, relax. Ross is great with him.
Don't look so surprised. I'm a lovely person.
Oh, this is so cute.
Ah, I got that for him!
"My Mommies Love Me."
That's clever.
Hello?
Oh, hi, Jul...
Hi, Jew!
Uh-huh. Okay, um, sure.
That'd be great. See you then. Bye.
Did you just say, "Hi, Jew"?
Yes. Um, yes, I did.
That was my friend Eddie Moskowitz.
Yeah, he likes it. Reaffirms his faith.
Ben, dinner!
Thanks, Aunt Pheebs.
You didn't microwave that, did you? It's breast milk, you're not supposed to.
Duh, I think I know how to heat breast milk. Heh.
Okay.
What did you just do?
I licked my arm, what?
It's breast milk!
So?
Phoebe, that is juice squeezed from a person.
What is the big deal? No, no...
What did you just do?
Can people stop drinking the breast milk?
You won't even taste it? - No.
Not even if you just pretend it's milk?
Not even if Carol's breast had a picture of a missing child on it.
Hey. Hi.
Where is everybody?  Took Ben to the park.
Where have you been?  Just out.
Had some lunch. Just me. A little quality time with me.
Hey, thanks for your jacket. Oh, no problem.
You can borrow it, by the way. Heh.
Oh, here are your keys, honey. Thank you.
Mon? Mm-hmm?
If, uh, you were at lunch alone, how come it cost you $53?
You know what probably happened?
Someone must have stolen my credit card. Ah.
And put the receipt back in your pocket?
Huh. That is an excellent, excellent question.
That is excellent.
What's with you? Who did you have lunch with?
Judy. Who?
Julie. Jody? What?
You were with Julie? Mm. Look.
When it started, I was just trying to be nice to her...
...because she was my brother's girlfriend.
And then one thing led to another...
...and before I knew it, we were...
...shopping. Aah.
Oh, my God.
Wait, we only did it once.
It didn't mean anything to me.
Yeah, right. Sure. Really!
Rachel, I was thinking of you the whole time.
Look, I'm sorry, all right? I never meant for you to find out.
Oh, please! Please! You wanted to get caught!
That is not true!
So you just happened to leave it in here?
Did it ever occur to you that I might just be that stupid?
Okay, Monica, I just have to know one thing.
Did you go with her to Bloomingdale's?
Okay. Okay.
Okay, I just really, um... I just need to not be with you right now.
Hi, who's this?
Hi, Joanne. Is Rachel working? It's Monica.
Yes, I know I did a horrible thing.
Joanne, it's not as simple as all that, okay?
No, I don't care what Steve thinks. Hi, Steve.
Hey! Hi!
How did we do?
Oh, I tasted Ben's milk and Ross freaked out.
I... I did not freak out.
Why'd you freak out?  Because it's breast milk.
It's gross!
My breast milk is gross?
This should be fun.
No, Carol. There's nothing wrong with it.
I just don't think breast milk is for adults.
Of course, the packaging does appeal to grownups and kids.
Ross, you're being silly. I've tried it. It's no big deal.
Come on, just taste it.Ha-ha-ha.
That would be no.
Come on. Try it.
It's natural.  It doesn't taste bad.
Yeah, it tastes kind of sweet. Sort of like, uh...
Like what?  Cantaloupe juice.
Exactly.
You've tasted it.
You've tasted it.
Oh, you've tasted it.
You can keep saying it, but it won't stop being true.
Give me the bottle.
Get me the towel.
Howdy.
Give me a box ofjuice.
Well, they switched me over to Hombre.
Maybe it's because of the way you're dressed.
Or maybe this guy's doing so good they want to put more people on it.
This guy goes through two bottles a day now.
What do you care?
You're an actor. This is your day job. Isn't supposed to mean anything.
I know, but I was the best.
You know? I liked being the best.
Maybe I should get out of the game.
They need guys up in housewares to serve cheese.
Say you do that.
Sooner or later, somebody will come along that slices a better cheddar.
And then where you gonna run?
I guess you're right.  Damn right I'm right.
Show this guy what you're made of. Stand your ground.
Show him that you're the baddest Hombre west of the lingerie!
I'm gonna do it!  All right!
Now, go see Miss Kitty and she'll fix you up with a nice hooker.
MONICA: I don't know what to say.
That works good because I'm not listening.
I feel terrible. I really do.
Oh, I'm sorry. Did my back hurt your knife?
Rachel!
Say that I'm friends with her. We spend time together.
Is that so terrible?  Yes.
It's that terrible?  Yes, Monica! You don't get it.
It's bad enough she stole the guy...
...who may be the person I'm supposed to be with.
But now...
...she's actually...
But now she's actually stealing you!
Me?
What are you talking about?
Nobody could steal me from you.
Because I'm friends with her doesn't make me any less friends with you.
Honey.
I mean, you're my...
And we're...
Oh, I love you!  I love you too!
You guys, um, I know that this really doesn't have anything to do with me.
But, um, I love you guys too!
Ugh, I really needed that.
Look, I know you're in a place right now...
...where you really need to hate Julie's guts.
But she didn't do anything wrong.
She's just a girl who met a guy, and now they go out.
I think that if you gave her a chance, you'd like her.
Will you give that a chance?
For me?
I'd do anything for you, you know that.
I'd do anything for you!
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
Morning.
Heh. I said, morning.
I heard you.
All right, everybody. I'm opening the doors.
You boys ready?
Ready.
Yeah, I'm ready.
You idiot! You stupid cowboy!
You've blinded me! I'm suing!
Oh, my God! Todd! What the hell did you do?
I'm sorry. I'm such a doofus!
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.
My God, what happened?
Eh, these new kids, they never last.
Sooner or later they all...
...stop lasting.
Listen, uh, what do you say I buy you that cup of coffee now?
Sure.
So.  So.
I just thought the two of us should hang out a bit.
I mean, you know, we've never really talked.
I guess you'd know that, being one of the two of us. Ha, ha, right?
I know.  Mm.
I probably shouldn't even tell you this...
...but I'm pretty much totally intimidated by you.
Really? Me?
Oh, my God, are you kidding?
Ross is so crazy about you...
...and I really wanted you to like me, and I...
It's probably me just being totally paranoid...
...but I kind of got the feeling that maybe you don't.
Well...
...you're not totally paranoid.
Okay. Um...
God. Um... - Heh.
When you and, uh, Ross first started going out...
...it was really hard for me, um...
...for many reasons of which I'm not gonna bore you with now, but, um...
I see how happy he is and how good you guys are together.
And, um, Monica's always saying how nice you are...
...and God, I hate it when she's right.
Thanks.  Yeah.
Listen. Would you like to go to a movie sometime or something?
Yeah, that'd be great. I'd love it.  Yeah?
I'd love it too. Okay. Okay.
Oh, shoot, I gotta go.  Okay.
So I'll talk to you later.  All right, Julie.
Bye.  Bye.
What a manipulative bitch.
It's not bad.
Hey. Hey.
So how was Joan? Broke up with her.
Oh, why?
Don't tell me. Because of the big nostril thing?
They were huge.
When she sneezed, bats flew out of them.
Come on, they were not that huge.
I'm telling you, she leaned back, I could see her brain.
How many women will you reject...
...over the most superficial, insignificant things?
Hold it. Hold it. I gotta side with Chandler on this one.
When I first moved to the city, I went out with this girl.
Really hot. Great kisser...
...but she had the biggest Adam's apple.
Drove me nuts.
You or me?  I got it.
Joey, women don't have Adam's apples.
Heh, heh. You guys are messing with me, right?
Yeah. We are.
That's a good one. For a second there, I was like, whoa!
Friends S02E03: The One Where Mr. Heckles Dies
So you name one woman that you broke up with for an actual real reason.
Maureen Rasillo.
Because she doesn't hate Yanni is not a real reason.
Hello, Mr. Heckles.
You're doing it again.
We're not doing anything.
You're stomping. It's disturbing my birds.
You don't have birds.
I could have birds.
Okay, we'll try to keep it down. Thank you.
I'm going to rejoin my dinner party.
All right, bye-bye.
Okay, Janice. You gotta give me Janice. That wasn't about being picky.
We'll give you Janice.
I miss Janice, though.
Hello, Chandler Bing!
Oh, my God! Oh, Chandler!
Now! Now!
That's it.
There! Faster!
Ugh. Stop with the broom! We're not making noise!
We won.
We won! Whoo!  Whoo!
Mr. Heckles.
How did this happen?  He was sweeping.
They found a broom in his hand.
Oh.Oh, dear God. That's terrible. I know.
I was sweeping yesterday.
It could've been me. Yeah.
Sure. Sweeping. You never know.
Never know.
Okay, it's very faint, but I can still sense him in the building.
Go into the light, Mr. Heckles!
Okay, Phoebe.
I'm sorry, but sometimes they need help.
Yeah. Here we go.
That's fine, go ahead and scoff.
There are a lot of things I don't believe in...
...but that doesn't mean they're not true.
Such as?
Like crop circles or the Bermuda Triangle or evolution.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What, you don't believe in evolution?
No. Not really.
You don't believe in evolution?
I don't know. It's just, you know...
Monkeys, Darwin, it's a nice story. I just think it's a little too easy.
"Too easy"? Too...
The process of every living thing on this planet evolving...
...over millions of years from single-celled organisms is "too easy"?
Yeah, I just don't buy it.
Excuse me. Evolution is not for you to buy, Phoebe.
Evolution is scientific fact, like the air we breathe...
...like gravity.
Okay, don't get me started on gravity.
You, uh...
You don't believe in gravity?
Well, it's not so much that, you know, I don't believe in it.
Lately I get the feeling that...
...I'm not so much being pulled down as I am being pushed.
Pushed.
Uh-oh. It's Isaac Newton and he's pissed.
There she is. And over there, that's the other one.
This is Mr. Buddy Boyle, Heckles' attorney. He'd like to talk to you.
What can we do for you?
All right, kids, here's the deal.
According my client's will...
...he wants to leave all his earthly possessions...
...to "the noisy girls in the apartment above mine."
What about his family?
He didn't have any. Whoa.
Okay, so let's talk money.
All right, there was none.
Now, let's talk signing.
You be noisy girl number one. You be noisy girl number two.
I can't believe that this whole time we thought he hated us.
Isn't it amazing how much you can touch someone's life...
...without even knowing it?
Would you look at this dump?
He hated us! This was his final revenge!
Ever seen so much crap!
Actually, I think this apartment sullies the good name of crap.
Check this out.
Can I have this?
How can you not believe in evolution?
I don't know, just don't. Look at this funky shirt!
Pheebs, I've studied evolution my entire adult life.
And I can tell you, we've collected fossils from all over the world...
...that actually show the evolution of different species.
I mean, you can literally see them...
...evolving through time.
Really? You can actually see it?
You bet! In the U.S., China, Africa, all over!
See, I didn't know that.
Well, there you go.
Huh.
So now the real question is, who put those fossils there and why?
Hey. Look at this. My Big Book of Grievances.
Hey, there's me.
"April 17th, excessive noise...
...ltalian guy comes home with a date." Yeah.
Chandler, you're in here too.
"April 18th, excessive noise...
...ltalian guy's gay roommate brings home dry cleaning."
Well, that's excellent.
Monica, look at this lamp.
Is this tacky or what? We have to have this.
I think we have enough regular lamps.
What? Come on, it's not like...
...I'm asking for this girlie clock or anything.
Which, by the way, I also think is really cool.
Look, it doesn't go with any of my stuff.
Well, what about my stuff?
You don't have any stuff.
You still think of it as your apartment, don't you?
Mmm... No. Yes, you do.
You think of it as your apartment and I just rent a room.
Mmm...
Okay, while you "mmm" on that, I'll go find a place for my new lamp.
Okay, Pheebs. See how I'm making these little toys move?
Opposable thumbs!
Without evolution, how do you explain opposable thumbs?
Maybe the Overlords needed them to steer their spacecrafts.
Tell me you're joking.
Look, can't we just say that you believe in something and I don't?
No. No, Pheebs, we can't. Why not?
What is this obsessive need you have to make everybody agree with you?
No, what's that all about? You know what I think?
I think maybe it's time you put Ross under the microscope.
Is there blood coming out of my ears?
Check it out. Heckles' high-school yearbook.
Wow. He looks so normal.
He's even kind of cute.
"Heckles, you crack me up in science class.
You're the funniest kid in school."
Funniest? Heckles?  That's what it says.
Wow. Heckles was voted class clown, and so was I.
He was right. Would you listen to that?
I'd call that excessive.
Whoa. What?
Heckles played clarinet in band, and I played clarinet.
And he was in the scale modeler's club and I was...
Well, there was no club, but I sure thought they were cool.
So? You were both dorks.
Big deal.
I just think it's weird, you know? Heckles and me...
Heckles and me. Me...
Me and Heckles.
Hey, would you knock it off!
Ah!
Have you been here all night?
Look at this.
Pictures of all the women Heckles went out with.
Look what he wrote on them. "Vivian, too tall."
"Madge, big gums."
"Too loud."
"Too smart." "Makes noise when she eats."
This is me.
This is what I do.
I'm gonna end up alone, just like he did.
Chandler, Heckles was a nut case.
Our trains are on the same track.
I'm coming up 30 years behind him, but the stops are all the same.
Bitter Town...
...Alone-ville, Hermit Junction!
You know what we gotta do? Get you out of here.
Come on, I'll buy you breakfast.
What if I never find somebody? Or worse, what if I found her...
...but I dumped her because she pronounces it "supposably"?
Chandler, come on, you're gonna find somebody.
How do you know that? How?
I don't know. I'm just trying to help you out.
You guys will all get married...
...and I'll end up alone.
Will you promise me something?
When you're married, will you invite me over for holidays?
I don't know what we'll be doing.
I mean, what if we're over at her folks' place?
Yeah, I understand.
You can come over and watch the Super Bowl.
Every year, all right?
You know what? I'm not gonna end up like this.
I'll see you, man.
Jeez.
"Supposably."
Supposably.
Did they go to the zoo?
Supposably.
Hi. It's me.
Oh, my God!
Janice? You called Janice?
Yes. Janice.
Why is that difficult to comprehend?
You remember Janice, right?
Yes. She was smart, she was pretty and she honestly cared about me.
Janice is my last chance to have somebody.
Hello.
Oh, my God!
Jeez, look how fat she got.
Hey, it's everybody. Hi, Janice.
Janice, you're...
Yes, I am.
Is it...?  Is it yours? Ha!
You wish, Chandler Bing.
You are looking at a married lady now.
Oh.
Yeah.
Congratulations.
Aw, sweetie, I'm sorry.
You couldn't tell me on the phone?
And what? Miss the expression on your face? Oh, no.
Janice likes to have her fun.
You know what we haven't played in a while?
What?  Hide the lamp.
Monica, let it go.
Did you know I'm allergic to shellfish?
Then you'll just have to eat the other lamps.
Uh-oh. It's scary scientist man.
Okay, Phoebe, this is it.
In this briefcase I carry actual scientific facts.
A briefcase of facts, if you will.
Some of these fossils are over 200 million years old.
Okay, look, before you even start, I'm not denying evolution.
It's just one of the possibilities.
It's the only possibility.
Ross, could you just open your mind, like, this much? Okay?
Wasn't there a time when the brightest minds in the world believe the Earth was flat?
And up till 50 years ago, you all thought the atom was the smallest thing...
...until you split it open and this whole mess of crap came out.
Now, are you telling me that you are so unbelievably arrogant...
...that you can't admit that there's a teeny, tiny possibility...
...that you could be wrong about this?
There might be...
...a teeny...
...tiny...
...possibility.
I can't believe you caved.
What? You just abandoned your whole belief system!
Before, I didn't agree with you, but at least I respected you.
But...
How are you gonna go into work tomorrow?
How are you going to face the other science guys?
How are you going to face yourself? Oh...
That was fun. So who's hungry? I am.
Me too. Let me just get my coat.
What happened? Okay. All right.
It was an accident, I swear.
I was putting on my jacket and the thing and the lamp and it broke.
Oh, please, Monica! You've always hated my lamp!
And now all of a sudden, it's just magically, it's just broken?
Phoebe, tell her?
I didn't see it, because I was putting on my jacket.
But I want to believe you.
Hey, Chandler. Monica just broke my seashell lamp.
Neat.
I'm gonna die alone!
Okay, you win.
Chandler, you are not gonna die alone.
Janice was my safety net, okay?
And now I have to get a snake.
Uh-huh. Why is that?
If I'm gonna be an old, lonely man, I'm gonna need a thing.
You know, a hook.
Like that guy on the subway who eats his own face.
So I figure I'll be "Crazy Man With A Snake."
Crazy Snake Man.
Then I'll get more snakes, call them my babies.
Kids won't walk past my place, they will run!
"Run away from Crazy Snake Man," they'll shout!
You've got to get over this. Okay?
You won't end up alone.
Of course I am.
I reject anyone who's crazy enough to actually go out with me...
...and then I bitch that there aren't any great women out there.
Chandler
You have just described...
...virtually every man that we've ever gone out with.
Yeah.
You are not a freak. You're a guy.
She's right. You're no different than the rest.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Yes, he is.
You are totally different. In a bad way?
No, honey, in a wonderful way.
You know what you want now.
Most guys don't even have a clue.
You're ready to take risks, be vulnerable and intimate with someone.
You're not gonna end up alone.
You called Janice. That's how much you wanted to be with someone!
You've made it.  You're there.
You are ready to make a commitment!
Whoa! Don't know about that.
Wow. What you got there?
Something else that's not yours that you can break?
No.
I know you like this and I want you to have it.
It'll look good in our apartment.
Thank you.
That's fine.
Hey. Hey.
You'll all be pleased to know that I have a date tomorrow night.
This woman Allison from work. She is great.
She's pretty, she's smart. And I've been...
...holding off asking her out in the past, because she has a...
...unusually large head.
But I'm not going to let that stuff hang me up anymore. All right.
Look at me. I'm growing.
Hey, you can't recycle yearbooks, can you?
I'll take that.
You want his yearbook?  Yeah. Yeah.
Some people said nice things about him. Somebody should have it.
Gosh, this is so weird.
His whole life was in this apartment and now it's gone.
I think it would be nice if we just took a few moments for Mr. Heckles.
I mean, he was kind of a pain. He was, but he was a person.
What?
You're all going to hell.
It's really not that big.
Taking that with you, huh?  Oh, yeah.
Hey, you coming?
Yeah, in a second.
Goodbye, Mr. Heckles.
We'll try to keep it down.
ALLISON: My major was useless.
How often do you look in the classifieds and see "Philosopher Wanted"?
Heh, heh. Sure.
My God, that's a big head!
It didn't look this big in the office. Maybe it's the lighting.
My head must look like a golf ball at work.
Don't get hung up on it. Quick, quick. List five things you like about her.
Nice smile, good dresser.
Big head, big head, big head!
Mom, would you relax?
That was 10 blocks from here, and the woman was walking alone at night.
I would never do that.
Mom, come on, stop worrying.
This is a safe street. This is a safe building. There's nothing...
Aah! Oh, my God! What are you doing in here?
Mom, I gotta go. I gotta go.
Oh, my God.
Okay.
That's fine, you just read the paper.
I'm gonna get a pot.
It's not for you.
Okay, that's fine.
Read the Family Circus...
...enjoy the gentle comedy...
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Ugh. Oh, God. Oh, God.
It's open, you guys.
Hi.  Hi. Can I help you?
I'm looking for Phoebe, does she still live here?
Uh, no, she doesn't. But I can get a message to her.
Great. Uh, just tell her her husband stopped by.
Her what? Aah!
Hey, how did you do that?
Friends S02E04: The One With Phoebe's Husband
This is unbelievable, Pheebs. How can you be married?
I'm not "married" married, you know?
He was just a friend, and he's gay...
...and he was from Canada, and he needed a Green Card.
I can't believe you married Duncan.
I mean, how could you not tell me? We lived together, we told each other everything.
I'm sorry, Monica, but I knew if I told you, you'd get really, like, judgmental...
...and would not approve. Of course I wouldn't approve.
You were totally in love with this guy who, hello, was gay.
I mean, what the hell were you thinking?
See? And you thought she'd be judgmental.
Okay, I wasn't in love with him. I was just helping out a friend.
Please. When he left town, you stayed in your pajamas for a month.
And I saw you eat a cheeseburger.
Well, didn't you?
I might have.
I can't believe you didn't tell me.
Come on. Like you tell me everything? What have I not told you?
Ooh, I don't know. Um...
...how about the fact that the underwear out there on the telephone pole is yours...
...from when you were having sex with Fun Bobby on the terrace.
What?   Wait a minute. Who told you?
You are dead meat.
I didn't know it was a big secret.
Oh, it's not big. Not at all.
You know, kind of on the same lines as, say
I don't know, having a third nipple.
You have a third nipple?
You bitch.
Whip it out. Whip it out. Yeah, yeah.
No, come on. There's nothing to see. It's just a tiny bump. It's totally useless.
Oh, as opposed to your other multifunctional nipples?
I can't believe you. You told me it was a nubbin.
Joey, what did you think a nubbin was?
I don't know. You see something, you hear a word, I thought that's what it was.
Let me see it again. Yeah, show us your nubbin.
Joey was in a porno movie.
If I'm going down, I'm taking everybody with me.
Oh, my God.You were in a porno?
I was young and I just wanted a job, okay?
But at the last minute I couldn't go through with it.
So they let me be the guy who comes in to fix the copier but can't...
...because there's people having sex on it.
Wow.
That is wild.
So, what's it shaped like? Is there a hair on it?
What happens if you flick it?
So, uh, does it do anything, you know, special?
Why, yes, Ross, pressing my third nipple opens the delivery entrance...
...to the magical land of Narnia.
You know, in some cultures, having a third nipple is actually a sign of virility.
You get the best huts, and women dance naked around you.
Huh. Are, uh, any of these cultures, per chance, in the Tri-State area?
You know, you are so amazing. Is there anything you don't know?
Ooh, Julie's so smart. Julie's so special.
Look, honey, I wanted you to hook up with Ross as much as you did.
But he's with her now. You're just gonna have to get over it.
Oh, I'm going to have to get over it.
God, see, I didn't know that's what I had to do. I just have to get over it.
Whoa.
Sassy lady. Where are you going?
Um, I'm gonna go meet Duncan. He's skating tonight at the Garden.
He's in the Capades.
The Ice Capades? No, no, the Gravel Capades.
Yeah, the turns aren't as fast, but when Snoopy falls? Funny.
I can't believe you're dressing up for him. You're setting yourself up all over again.
Okay, no.
For your information, I'm going to see him so I can put all those feelings behind me.
And the reason I'm dressed like this is because I think it's nice...
...to look nice for your gay husband.
Darn it, we're all out of milk.
Hey, Chandler, will you fill me up here?
Oh, I see, I see. Because of the third-nipple thing.
Okay, sweetie, I'll see you later.  Bye.
See you later, Rach. Bye-bye, Julie.
Hey. Hey.
Hey, come on, cut it out.
Hey. What?
Can I ask you something?  Sure.
Eh. What?
Come on, talk to me. Okay.
What's the longest you've been in a relationship before...
...having the sex?
Why? Who's not...? Are you and Julie not...?
Are you and Julie not having sex?
Well...
Technically? No.
Is it because she's so cold in bed?
Or is it because she's kind of bossy, makes it feel like school?
No. No. She's great. And it's not like we haven't done anything.
I mean, we do plenty of other stuff. Lots of other stuff like...
No, no, no. Don't need to know the details.
No, it's just...
It's me.
You know, I've only been with one woman my whole life...
...and she turned out to be a lesbian. Uh-huh.
So now I've got myself all psyched out.
It's become, like, this...
...this thing, and I...
You must just think I'm weird.
No. No, no, no. I don't think it's weird.
I think... I think, um, in fact...
In fact, you know what I think? What?
I think it's sexy.
Sexy?
Let me tell you something. As a woman... ...there is nothing sexier...
...than a man who does not want to have sex.
No kidding.  Oh, yeah. In fact, you know what I'd do?
I'd wait.
You'd wait? Yes, absolutely. I would wait...
...and wait...
Then I'd wait some more.
Really? Oh, yeah.
I don't care how much she tells you she wants it, I don't care if she begs... ...she pleads
She tells you she's gonna have sex with another man.
That just means it's working.
Women really want this?
More than jewelry.
Hi.
Phoebe.Ta-da.
Hi.
Ah, look at you. You look great.
Do I? Thank you.
So do you. Sparkly. Thanks.
So...
Wow. This is pretty wonderful, huh, Mr. Major Capades Guy.
I remember when you were just like King Friday in Mr. Roger's Ice Is Nice.
You always said I'd make it.
Yeah, well, you know, I'm kind of spooky that way. Woo.
God, I missed you.
I'm gonna get changed. Okay.
Um, now.
What? Pheebs.
Oh. Right. Okay.
What?
The Matador, so...
Olé. Ha, ha.
Sweetie, can you hold this for a second? Sure.
Thanks.
Uh, Julie?  Yeah.
Sorry, you had a paleontologist on your face.
But, uh, it's gone now. You're all right.
Hi, everyone.Hi.
Oh, listen, listen... I wanted to thank you for, uh, our little talk before.
Oh, God, no problem. So you're gonna go with the waiting thing?
Well, I was going to, but after I talked to you, I talked to Joey.
Good. Ahem. What did he say?
Basically, he told me to get over myself and just do it.
So I thought about what you said and about what he said.
And, well, his way, I get to have sex tonight, so...
What is this in my pocket?
Why, it's Joey's porno movie.
Pop it in.
I'm fine with it, I mean, if you're okay watching a video filled with two-nippled people.
Great. People having sex. That's just what I need to see.
What's wrong with people having sex?
Well...
Well, um, you know, these movies are offensive...
...and, uh, degrading to women and females...
And, uh, the lighting's always unflattering.
And...
Monica, help me out here. Hell, I wanna see Joey.
So is there, like, a story, or do they just start doing it right...
Oh. Never mind.
Okay, now, wait a minute. That is the craziest typing test I've ever seen.
All I say is, she better get the job.
Looks to me like he's the one getting the job.
Shh. Hey, here I come. Here I come.
See, I'm coming to fix the copier.
I can't get to the copier. I'm thinking, "What do I do? What do I do?"
So I just watch them have sex.
And then I say... Here's my line.
You know, that's bad for the paper tray.
Nice work, my friend. Thank you.
Wait, you see me again. Hang on, the guy's butt's blocking me.
There I am. There I am. There I am.
So, um... So, what's up? You came to see me yesterday.
Oh, yeah, um...
All right.
I kind of need a divorce.
Okay.
How come?
Um, actually, I'm getting married again.
What? Oh, God, I don't know how to tell you this.
I'm straight.
Yeah, I know.
I don't understand. I don't understand. How can you be straight?
I mean, you're so smart and funny... ...and you throw such great Academy Award parties.
I know. That's what I kept telling myself.
But you just reach a point where you can't live a lie anymore.
So how long have you known?
I guess on some level I always knew I was straight.
I thought I was supposed to be something else.
You know, I'm an ice dancer, all my friends are gay. I was just trying to fit in.
And, um...
And there's actually a woman?
Her name's Debra.Oh.
Well, is she the first that you've been with?
Well, I've never told you this...
...but there were one or two times back in college...
...when I'd get really drunk and go to a straight bar...
...and wake up with a woman next to me.
But I told myself it was the liquor, and everyone experiments in college.
Sure.
But now I know I don't have a choice about this. I was born this way.
I don't know what to say.
You know, you're married to someone for six years... and you think you know him.
And then one day he says, "Oh, I'm not gay."
I'm... I'm still me.
Why couldn't you just have figured this out six years ago?
You know, it still smells like monkey in there.
Well, that saves us the conversation.
Well, this has been great, but I'm officially wiped.
Me too. We should get going.No.
No. I mean... No. Come on, you guys.
Come on, look, it's only 11:30.
Let's just talk. We never just hang out and talk anymore.
Rachel, that's all we do.
Maybe that's all we do. What about Julie?
What about Julie?
Well, you have been in our lives for nearly two months now...
...and we don't really know you.
I mean, who is Julie? I mean, what do you like? What don't you like?
We want to know everything.
Well, heh, that could take a while.
So?
I mean, who here does not have the time to get to know Julie?
I got the time to get to know Julie. I got time, yeah.
Uh, Rach, ahem, I know her pretty well. Can I go?
That's fine.
Okay, Julie, so let's start with your childhood. What was that like?
Well, in a nutshell... Ah-ah-ah.
So, um, have you told your parents?
No, but it'll be okay. They're pretty cool.
My brother's straight, so...
Here you go.
You know what? I just have one more question. Um...
If you had figured this out sooner, and, um, I had been around...
...do you think I would have been the one who?
No, no. That's all right. Don't tell me.
I don't think either answer would make me feel better. Here.
I love you, Phoebe.
So your brother's straight, huh?
Seriously.
And my second-grade teacher was Miss Thomas...
...and my first-grade teacher was Mrs. Cobb.
Ahem. Mrs. Gobb?
No, Cobb. Like cobb salad.
Hmm, okay.
Now, what exactly is in a cobb salad?
I'm going home.
Boy, that Julie's a talker, huh?
Good night.
Whew.
So...  Good night.
It's pretty late. You're probably, uh, not still planning on...
Oh. No, no, I am. Oh.
Well, hey, are you nervous?
No, no. I, uh...
I have done it before.
Well, okay, I mean, how are you gonna handle it?
Are you gonna talk about it beforehand? Are you just gonna pounce?
I, uh... I don't know. I guess I'm just gonna...
...see what happens.
Okay. Good luck.
What...? Uh...
What?  Nothing. I mean, um...
It is your first time with her, and, you know, if the first time doesn't go well...
...well then, that's pretty darn hard to recover from.
Okay, now I'm nervous.
Maybe you should put it off.
No, I don't want to put it off.
God, I'm just... I spent last year being so unbelievably miserable.
And now I'm actually happy.
You know, I mean, really happy.
I just don't wanna...
I don't wanna mess it up, you know?
I know.
Yeah.
I'm sorry. No, it's not your fault.
Right.
Maybe it doesn't have to be this tough.
Maybe you were on the right track with that whole, you know, spontaneous thing.
I mean, women really like that. Really?
Yeah. I mean, you know, if...
I mean if it were me, I'd, you know, want you to...
What? I don't know, catch me off guard. You know, with, like, a really...
...good kiss.
You know, really...
...sort of, um, soft at first.
And then maybe, um, brush the hair away from my face.
And then look far into my eyes...
...in a way that lets me know something...
...amazing is about to happen.
Uh-huh.
And then, I don't know, then...
...you'd pull me really close to you so that...
So that I'd be pressed up, you know, right against you.
And, um, it would get kind of...
...sweaty...
...and, uh... And blurry.
And then it's just happening.
Oh.
Thanks, Rach. Good night.
Oh, God.
Good morning.
Well, somebody got some last night.
Twice.
Man, I sure miss Julie.
Spanish midgets.
Spanish midgets wrestling...
Julie. Okay, yes, I see how you got there.
You ever figure out what that thing's for?
No, see, I'm trying this screening thing.
I figure if I always answer the phone, people will think I don't have a life.
My God. Rodrigo never gets pinned.
Here comes the beep. You know what to do.
Hello. I'm looking for Bob.
This is Jade.
I don't know if you're still at this number, but I was just thinking about us...
...and how great it was, and, well, I know it's been three years...
...but I was kind of hoping we could hook up again.
You know, I barely had the nerve to make this call...
...so you know what I did? - What?
I got a little drunk...
...and naked.
Bob here.
Friends S02E05: The One With Five Steaks and an Eggplant
So, uh, what have you been up to?
Oh, you know, the usual.
Teaching aerobics...
...partying way too much. Heh.
Oh, and in case you were wondering...
...those are my legs on the new James Bond poster.
Can you hold on a moment? I have another call.
I love her.  I know.
I'm back. So are we gonna get together?
Uh, absolutely.
Uh, how about tomorrow afternoon?
Do you know, uh, Central Perk in the village? Say, five-ish?
Great. I'll see you then. Okay.
Okay.
Having a phone has finally paid off.
Even though you do do a good Bob impression...
...I'm thinking when she sees you tomorrow...
...she's probably gonna realize, hey, you're not Bob.
I am hoping that when Bob doesn't show up...
...she will seek comfort in the open arms of the wry stranger at the next table.
Oh, my God. You are pure evil.
Okay, pure evil...
...horny and alone.
I've done this.
Yeah, yeah, everybody's here.
Hey, everybody. Say hi to Julie in New Mexico.
Hi, Julie.
Hi, Julie.
Okay. While Ross is on the phone...
...everybody owes me 62 bucks for his birthday.
Um, is there any chance that you're rounding up from...
...you know, from like 20?
Hey, come on, we got the gift, the concert and the cake.
Do we need a cake?
Look, I know it's a little steep.
Whoosh.
But it's Ross.
Yeah, it's Ross. Yeah, you're right.
All right? Okay. I'll see you later. I gotta go...
...do a thing.
Okay, sweetheart, I'll call you later tonight.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, you're not really going through with this, are you?
You know, I think I might just.
So, uh, what are you guys doing for dinner tonight?
Well, I guess I gotta start saving up for Ross' birthday.
So I guess I'll just stay home and eat dust bunnies.
Can you believe how much this is gonna cost?
Do you guys ever get the feeling that, um...
...Chandler and those guys...
...just don't get that we don't make as much money as they do?
Yes. Really?
It's like they're always saying, "Let's go here, let's go there."
Like we can afford to go here and there.  Yeah.
Yes, and we always have to go to, you know, someplace nice, you know?
It's not like we can say anything about it, because, like, this is a birthday thing...
...you know, and it's for Ross.
For Ross. For Ross.
Oh, my God.
Hi.  What?
Okay. I'm at work...
...just an ordinary day, you know, chop, chop, sauté, sauté.
All of a sudden, Leon, the manager, calls me into his office.
Turns out they fired the head lunch chef, and guess who got the job.
If it's not you, this is a horrible story.
Fortunately, it is me. Oh.
And they made me head of purchasing, thank you very much.
That's so cool.
Anyway, I just ran into Chandler and Ross. We should go out and celebrate.
You know, someplace nice.
Someplace nice. Yeah.
How much you think I can get for my kidney?
I'm telling you, you can't do this.
Oh, come on, I can't get a girl like that with conventional methods.
That doesn't matter.
She wanted to call Bob.
Hey, for all we know, Bob is who she was meant to be with.
You may be destroying two people's chance for happiness.
We don't know Bob.
Okay? We know me. We like me. Please let me be happy.
Go over there and tell that woman the truth.
All right.
Go.
Hi.
Hi.
Listen, I have to, uh, ahem...
I have to confess something.
Yes?
Whoever stood you up is a jerk.
How did you...  I don't know.
I just had this weird sense. You know? But that's me, I'm weird and sensitive.
Tissue?
Thanks.
No, no, you keep the pack.
I'm all cried out today.
Okay, okay.
Here is to my sister, the newly appointed head lunch chef.
Who is also in charge of purchasing.
Newly appointed head lunch chef, also in charge of purchasing...
Who has her own little desk when Roland's not there.
Uh, lunch chef, purchasing, own little desk when Roland's not there...
...here's to my little sister... Oh, wait. And I got a beeper.
Oh, cool.
That's fine, I'll just wait.  Aw, sorry.
JOEY: Oh, sorry, sorry.
Monica.
Are we ready to order?
Oh. You know, we haven't even looked yet.
Well, when you do, just let me know.
I'll be right over there on the edge of my seat.
Wow, look at these prices.
Yeah, these are pretty "cha-ching."
I know. What are these, famous chickens?
Sorry I'm late. Congratulations, Mon. - Thanks.
I'm not sorry I'm late. How incredible was my afternoon with Jade?
Well, pretty incredible, according to the message she left on my machine.
Hey, Chandler, why is this woman leaving a message for you on my machine?
See, I had to tell her that my number was your number.
I couldn't tell her my number was my number...
...because she thinks my number is Bob's number.
Hey, tell me again. What do I do when Mr. Roper calls?
Do I dare ask?
Yes, I'll start with the carpaccio, and then I'll have the grilled prawns.
That sounds great, same for me. And for the gentleman?
Yeah, I'll have the Thai chicken pizza.
But, hey, look, if I get it without the nuts and leeks and stuff...
...is it cheaper?
You'd think, wouldn't you?
Miss?  Okay.
I will have the, uh... side salad.
And what would that be on the side of?
I don't know.
Why don't you just put it right here next to my water?
And for you?
Um, I'm gonna have a cup of the cucumber soup...
...and, um...
...take care.
I will have the, uh, Cajun catfish.  Anything else?
Yes, how about a verse of "Killing Me Softly"?
You're gonna sneeze in my fish, aren't you?
Plus tip, divided by six...
Okay, everyone owes 28 bucks.
Um, everyone?
Oh. You're right, I'm sorry.
Thank you.
It's Monica's big night. She shouldn't pay.
Aw, thank you.
So five of us is...
...33.50 apiece.
No. Uh-uh. No way. Sorry, not gonna happen.
Whoa. Whoa. Prom night flashback.
Sorry, Monica. I'm really happy you got promoted...
...but cold cucumber mush for 30-something bucks?
No.
Rachel just had that little salad...
...and Joey with his, like, teeny pizza.
Okay, Pheebs.
How about we'll each just pay for what we had, okay?
It's no big deal.  Not for you.
All right, what's going on?
Okay, look, I really don't wanna get into this right now.
It'll just make everybody uncomfortable. Oh, fine. All right, fine.
What? Whoa, whoa. You can tell us.
Yeah, hello? It's us. All right? We'll be fine.
Yeah.
Ahem. Okay, um...
Uh, we three feel like that, uh, ahem...
...sometimes you guys don't get that, uh, ahem...
We don't have as much money as you.
Okay. I hear you.
We can talk about that.
Well, then...
...let's.
Well, um, I guess I just never think of money as an issue.
That's because you have it. That's a good point.
So, um, how come you guys haven't talked about this before?
Because it's always something, you know? Like with Monica's new job...
...or the whole Ross' birthday hoopla.
What? Whoa, hey.
I don't want my birthday to be the source of any kind of negative...
There's gonna be a hoopla?
Basically there's the thing, and then the stuff after the thing and it's...
If it makes anybody feel better, we can just forget the thing...
...and we'll just do the gift.
Gift? The thing's not the gift?
No, the thing was we were gonna go see Hootie and the Blowfish.
Hootie and the... Oh, my... I can catch them on the radio.
No. Now I feel bad. You wanna go to the concert.
No, look, hey, it's my birthday...
...and the important thing is that we all be together.
All of us.  Together.
Not at the concert.
Okay. Thank you. - Thanks.
Yeah.
So, the Ebola virus. That's gotta suck, huh?
Gee, Monica. What's in the bag?
I don't know, Chandler. Let's take a look.
Oh, it's like a skit.
Why, it's dinner for six. Five steaks...
...and an eggplant for Phoebe.
We switched meat suppliers at work, and they gave me the steaks as a thank-you.
But wait, there's more. Hey, Chandler, what is in that envelope?
By the way, this didn't seem so dorky out in the hall.
Come on.
Why, it's six tickets to Hootie and the Blowfish.
The Blowfish.
It's on us, all right? So don't worry. This is our treat.
So... thank you.
Could you be less enthused?
Look, it's a nice gesture. It is.
But it just feels like...
Like?
Charity.  Charity?
We're just trying to do a nice thing here.
But, Ross, you have to understand, your nice thing makes us feel about this big.
Actually, it makes us feel that big.
What? I don't understand. I mean, it's like we can't win with you guys.
If you guys feel this big, maybe that's not our fault.
Maybe that's just how you feel.
Oh.
Now you're telling us how we feel. We never should have talked about this.
I'm gonna pass on the concert...
...because I'm just not in a very Hootie place right now.
Me neither.  Me too.
Guys, we bought the tickets.
Well, then you'll have extra seats, you know, for all your tiaras and stuff.
Why did you look at me when you said that?
So I guess now we can't go.
Come on, do what you want. Do we always have to do everything together?
You know what? You're right.
Fine.  Fine.
Fine.  Fine.
Fine. All right.
We're gonna go.
It's not for another six hours. We're gonna go then.
Chandler? Yeah.
Oh, jeez.
Are you ready?  Yes.
Just let me grab my jacket and tell you I had sex today. Whoa, whoa.
What? You had sex today?
Wow. It sounds even cooler when somebody else says it.
I was awesome, okay? She was biting her lip to stop from screaming.
Wow.
Now, I know it's been a while, but I took that as a good sign.
Still doing the screening thing?
I had sex today.
I never have to answer that phone again.
Here comes the beep. You know what to do.
Hey, Bob. It's Jade.
I just wanted to tell you I was really hurt when you didn't show up the other day.
And just so you know, I ended up meeting a guy.
Bob here.
Oh, hi.
So, uh, you met someone, huh?
Yes. Yes, I did.
In fact, I had sex with him two hours ago.
So, uh, how was he?
Eh...
"Eh"?
Oh, Bob, he was nothing compared to you.
I had to bite my lip to keep from screaming your name.
Well, that makes me feel so good.
It was just so awkward and bumpy.
Bumpy?
Maybe he had some kind of, uh, new cool style that you're not familiar with.
And, uh, maybe you have to get used to it.
There wasn't much time to get used to it... ...if you know what I mean.
You know what? I'm not gonna be able to enjoy this.
Yeah, I know. It's my birthday. We all should be here.
So let's go.
Well, you know, maybe we should stay for one song.
Yeah, I mean, it would be rude to them for us to leave now.
You know, the guys are probably having a great time.
Come on, you guys. One more time.
Okay.
One. - No.
Thank you very much. We are Hootie & The Blowfish.
That was amazing.  Excellent.
I can't believe the guys missed this.
What guys? Oh, yeah.
Excuse me. You're Monica Geller, aren't you?
Do I know you? You used to be my baby-sitter.
Oh, my God. Little Stevie Fisher?
How have you been?
Good, good. I'm a lawyer now.
You can't be a lawyer. You're 8.
Well, listen, it was nice to see you. I gotta run backstage.
Wait, backstage? Oh, yeah. My firm represents the band.
Ross.  Chandler.
Look, you guys wanna meet the group?  Yeah, we do.
Come on.
So, look, are you one of the ones that fooled around with my dad?
Hey, you guys. Happy birthday.
Oh, thank you. Thanks.
So, uh...
How was your night last night?
Oh, well, it pretty much sucked. How was yours?
Yeah, ours pretty much sucked too.
Oh, but I did run into Stevie Fisher. Remember him?
Oh, yeah. I used to baby-sit him.
Hey, how's his dad?
Good.
Uh, aside from that, the whole evening was pretty much a bust.
Yeah, we really missed you guys.
Yeah, look, we were just saying, this whole thing is so stupid.
We just have to really, really not let stuff like money, get like...
Is that a hickey?
Oh, ha, ha, no, I just...
I fell down.
On someone's lips?
Where'd you get the hickey?
You know, a party or...  What party?
Well, it wasn't a party so much as a... A gathering of people.
With food and music and...
And the band.
You partied with Hootie and the Blowfish?
Yes. Apparently, Stevie and Hootie are like this.
Who gave you that hickey?
That would be the work of a Blowfish.
I can't believe it. I can't believe this.
We're just sitting at home, trying to guess Joey's fingers...
...and you guys are out, like, partying and having fun and all:
"Hey, Blowfish, suck on my neck."
Hey, look, don't blame us. You guys could've been there.
Oh, what? As part of your Poor Friends Outreach program?
Oh, great. It's work.
Look, I don't know what to say. I'm sorry that we make more than you.
But we're not gonna feel guilty about it. We work really hard for it.
And we don't work hard?
Yeah, hi, it's Monica. I got a page.
I'm just saying that sometimes we like to do stuff that costs a little more.
Oh, and you feel like we hold you back.  Yes.
No.
Leon, wait. Shh! Guys.
Wait, I don't understand.
Those steaks were just a gift from the meat vendor.
That was not a kickback.
Come on, I'll just replace them and we can forget the whole thing.
What corporate policy?
Yeah.
Okay.
I just got fired.
WAITRESS: Here's your check. That'll be 4.12.
Let me get that.
You got 5 bucks?
Here comes the beep. You know what to do.
Hi, it's me.
Listen, Bob, I'm probably way out of line here.
I mean, it has been three years, and you're probably seeing someone else now...
...but if we could just have one night together, just for old time's sake...
One hot, steamy, wild night...
Who the winny-binny boy?
Oh, you the winny-winny-binny-binny boy!
Yes.
Don't cry.
Don't cry, huh?
Why is he still crying?
Let me hold him for a sec.
Here we go. Huh?
Huh. There we are.
Maybe it's me.
Don't be silly. Ben loves you. He's just being Mr. Cranky Pants.
You know, I once dated a Miss Cranky Pants.
Lovely girl. Kind of moody.
There we go, all better.
There's my little boy. Eh.
Can I, uh, see something?
Cool!  He hates me.
My nephew hates me!  Come on, don't do this.
What if my own baby hates me, huh? What do I do then?
Monica, stop! This is nuts.
Do you know how long it's gonna be before you actually have to deal with this problem?
You don't even have a boyfriend yet.
Joey, she does not look fat.
Friends S02E06: The One With the Baby on the Bus
Here you go.
Oh, hey, Mon.
Goo, goo, goo!
That is so funny! Let me see that a sec. Ha-ha-ha.
Whoa.
You okay?
I don't know.
What's in this pie?
I don't know. Um, butter and eggs and flour and lime and kiwi...
Kiwi? Kiwi?!
You said it was a key lime pie.
No, I didn't. I said kiwi lime. That's what makes it so special.
That's what's gonna kill me.
Ahem. I'm allergic to kiwi.
No, you're not. You're allergic to lobster and peanuts and...
Oh, my God!  Uh. It's definitely getting worse.
All right. Is your tongue swelling up?
Either that or my mouth is getting smaller!
Get your coat. We'll to the hospital. Uh.
Will he be okay?  He's gotta get a shot.
Uh, you know, actually, it's getting better. It is.
Let's not go. Anyone up for Scrabble?
Jacket, now!
What about Ben? We can't bring a baby to the hospital.
We'll watch him.
Uh. Ha, I don't think so.
What? I have seven Catholic sisters. I've taken care of hundreds of kids.
Come on, we want to do it. Don't we?
I was gonna play basketball...
...but I guess that's out the window.
If you take him out for a walk, remember to bring his hat.
There's milk in the refrigerator and diapers in the bag.
Hat, milk... Got it!
Let's go.  Okay.
Consider it done!
You understood?
My uncle Sal has a really big tongue.
Is he the one with the beautiful wife?
Hey, Rach.
You want to hear the song I'm singing this afternoon?
I wrote it this morning in the shower. Okay.
I'm in the shower and I'm writing a song
Stop me if you've heard it
My skin is soapy and my hair is wet
And Tegrin spelled backward is nirget
Uh, Rachel, sweetheart, could I see you for a minute?
What's up? - Uh...
for your information
I've decided to pay a professional musician to play here on Sundays.
Her name is Stephanie something. Uh, she's supposed to be very good.
But what about Phoebe?
Rachel, uh, it's not that your friend is bad.
It's that she's so bad...
...she makes me want to put my finger through my eye into my brain...
...and swirl it around.
Okay, so you're not a fan.
But, I mean, come on. You cannot do this to her.
Uh.
Oh, no, no, no.
I have to do this to her? Mm-hm.
Lather, rinse, repeat And lather, rinse, repeat
As needed
We didn't bring enough stuff.
Did you forget to pack the baby's anvil?
I'm telling you, it'll be worth it.
It's a known fact that women love babies, all right?
Women love guys who love babies. It's the sensitive thing.
Aim him at that pack of babes. Maybe one of them will break away.
Wait, forget them. We got one. Hard left.
Give me the baby.  No, I got him.
Come on, seriously.
Oh, seriously, you want him?
Hello. Hello.
Who is this little cutie-pie?
Well, don't think me immodest, but...
...me.
Want to smell him?
I assume we're talking about the baby?
Oh, yeah. Ha, ha.
He's got that great baby smell. Get a whiff of his head.
My uterus just skipped a beat.
What'd I tell you?
It's great you're doing this.
Well, we are great guys.
My brother and his boyfriend have been trying to adopt.
What agency did you two go through?
But this is my gig.
This is where I play.
My name is written out there in chalk.
You know, you can't just erase chalk.
Honey, I'm sorry.
And he's going to be paying this woman?
Why doesn't he just give her a throne and a crown?
And, like, you know, a gold stick with a ball on top?
Terry is a jerk! That's why we always say, "Terry's a jerk!"
That's where that came from.
Yeah, okay.
You probably did everything you could.
You know what? Let me just see what else I can do.
All right, look, look.
Just let her go on after Stephanie whatever her name is.
You won't be here. You don't pay her.It's not gonna cost you anything.
I don't know.
Come on, Terry，I'll clean the cappuccino machine!
You don't clean the cappuccino machine?
Of course I clean it.
I mean, I will clean it.
I will clean it.
All right, fine, fine, fine!
Oh.
Done.  Really?
Who's working for you, babe?
Oh, my God! This is so exciting! I know.
How much am I gonna get?
What?
He's paying the people who were playing.
Oh, no, no, no.
I meant, he's paying that other woman because she's a professional.
I'm not gonna be the only one who's not getting paid.
But, Pheebs...
Uh-uh, I'm sorry, no!
No, I'm not some sloppy second, you know, charity band.
There are thousands of places in this city...
...where people would pay to hear me play.
When I play, I play for me
I don't need your charity
Thank you!
Well, there's no way I'm not getting a shot. Maybe they can take the needle...
...and squirt it into my mouth. Like a squirt gun.
Hello there. I'm Dr. Carlin.
I see someone's having a little allergic reaction.
Doctor, can I see you for just a moment?
My brother has a slight phobia about needles.
Did you tell him about my squirt gun idea?
My brother, the Ph.D., would like to know...
...if there's any way to treat this orally?
No.
Under these circumstances, it has to be an injection, and it has to be now.
So?
Oh.
Go and have a seat. Um, the doctor says it's got to be a needle.
You're just going to have to be brave. Can you do that for me?
Okay.  Okay.
Oh, boy! You are doing so good.
You want to squeeze my hand?  Yes.
Ross, don't squeeze it so hard.
Honey, really. Don't squeeze it so hard!
Let go of my hand!
Good plan. Next time we want to pick up women...
...we should go to the park and make out.
Taxi! Taxi!
Look at that talent.
Just practicing. You're good.
Carry on.
Wait, wait, wait!
Hey, you. He's just adorable.
Can you tell him that? Because he thinks he looks too pink.
What are you guys out doing today?  We're not out.
No, no. No.
We're two heterosexual guys hanging with the son...
...of our other heterosexual friend, doing the usual straight-guy stuff.
You done?  Yeah.
Oh, there's our stop.
Get out of here! This is our stop.
You guys live around here too?  Yeah, sure.
We live in the building by the, uh, sidewalk.
You know it?
Ha, ha. Since we're neighbors, what do you say we, uh, get together for a drink?
So, uh, you want to go to Markel's?
Oh, sure, they love us over there.
Where's your baby?
Ben! Ben!
Ben! Ben!
That's good. Maybe he'll hear you and pull the cord!
Stop the bus! Hey!
Hey, there's a baby! Wait, wait, wait!
Are you sure he didn't break it? It hurts.
No, it's just a good bone bruise.
And right here is the puncture wound from your ring.
I'm really sorry.  It's okay.
Sorry.
Hmm, sorry! I got my S's back! Ha, ha.
Which we can celebrate later.
Celebrate. Celebrate...
He was a double, double
Double-jointed boy
Hey.
So, um, are you the professional guitar player?
Yeah, I'm Stephanie.
Oh, right. My name was on there, but now it just says carrot cake.
Okay.
So, um, how many chords do you know?
All of them.  So you know D?
Yeah.  Do you know A-minor?
Yeah.  Okay.
Do you know how to go from D to A-minor?
Yeah.  Okay.
Um, so does your guitar have a strap?
No.  Oh. Mine does.
Stephanie knows all the chords
Come on! Pick up, pick up!
Hello. Ahem.
Transit Authority? Yes, hello.
I'm doing research for a book.
I was wondering what somebody might do if they left a baby on a city bus.
Yes, I realize that would be a stupid character.
Here's the deal: We lost a car seat on a bus.
It's white plastic and it fits onto a stroller.
Oh, and there was a baby in it.
He wants to talk to you.
Everybody, let's give a warm Central Perk welcome to...
Terry's a jerk and he won't let me work
And I hate Central Perk
Uh, to Stephanie Schiffer!
Whoo!
I'd like to start with a song I wrote for the first man I ever loved.
Zachary...
Are all invited to bite me
We're the guys that called about the baby! Is he here?!
He's here. Aah!
I assume one of you is the father.
That's me.  I'm him.
Actually, uh, ahem, we're both the father.
Oh, Ben! Hey, buddy.
Please tell me you know which one is our baby.
That one has ducks on his T-shirt and this one has clowns.
And Ben was definitely wearing ducks.
Or clowns.
Oh, wait.
That one's Ben! Remember he had that cute little mole by his mouth!
Yeah?  Yeah.
Hey, Ben! Remember us?
Okay, the mole came off.
What are we gonna do?  Uh.
We'll flip for it. Ducks or clowns.
Flip for the baby?  You got a better idea?
All right, call it in the air.
Heads.
Heads, it is.  Yes.
We have to assign heads to something!
Right! Okay.
Okay, uh...
Ducks is heads because ducks have heads.
What kind of scary-ass clowns came to your birthday?
Hey  Oh, hi.
Here. I thought you might be cold.
Thank you.
Oh.
Oh, look at you! You did pretty well.
$8.27.
But not really, because I put in the first two.
Just to get the ball rolling and to make myself feel better.
Do you?
No.
You know, this whole playing for money thing is so not good for me.
I don't know, when I sang "Su-su-suicide"...
...I got, like, $1.75.
But then "Smelly Cat"? Oh.
I got 25 cents and a condom.
So, you know, now I just feel really bad for "Smelly Cat."
Well, you know.
Honey, I don't think everybody gets "Smelly Cat."
I mean, if all you've ever actually had are healthy pets, then whoosh!
But it's not even that, you know?
I used to do my songs because it made me happy.
Now it's just all about the money, you know?
Well, people missed you in there.
In fact, there was actually a request for "Smelly Cat."
Really? From who?
Well, me.
And I know it's not your big money song, but it's my favorite.
Hi.
Uh. Did I accidentally drop a condom in your case?
It's kind of an emergency.
Yeah.
Here you go.  Thanks a lot.
Hey, Christine! I got it!
I want to thank you for being there for me.
And I'm sorry I almost broke your hand. Ha, ha.
That's okay. I'm sorry I poisoned you.
Mm.
Remember the time I jammed that pencil into your hand?
Remember it? What do you think this is, a freckle?
Oh.
What about the time I hit you in the face with Sylvian's pumpkin?
Remember when I stuck that broom in your spokes...
...and you hit your head on the curb?
No.
But I remember people telling me about it.
Oh.
I hope Ben has a little sister.
Yeah.
And I hope she can kick his ass.
I'm gonna get a new Band-Aid.
How about the time I cut the legs off your Malibu Ken?
That was you?
Uh.
They were infected. He wouldn't have made it.
Aw.
My little nephew.
Come here, little one!
Oh. There's my little baby, Ben!
Hey, my little boy. Oh.
Hey, he's not crying!
Hey, he's not crying!
Yes.
There's still pie! Ha-ha-ha.
I'm here. I'm here.
Uh. How's my little boy, huh?
You want Daddy to change your diaper? I know, I know.
Did you have fun with, uh, Uncle Joey and Uncle Chandler today?
Oh, yeah.
He rode the bus today. Ooh.
Well.
Big boy riding the bus...
Hey, I have a question.
How come it says, "Property of Human Services"?
You...
You are gonna love this.
Can you hold Ben for a sec?
Come here. Come here.
Stay back! I've got kiwi! Run, Joey, run!
Smelly cat, smelly cat
What are they feeding you?
No, no. I'm sorry, it's, ahem:
Smelly cat, smelly cat
Smelly cat, smelly cat
Better! Yeah?
Much better. Good.
Don't feel bad, because it's a hard song.
Yeah.
You want to try it again?  From the top?
There is no "top," all right?
That's the beauty of "Smelly Cat."
Um. Ahem. Why don't you just follow me?
Okay.Mm-hm.
Smelly cat, smelly cat
What are they feeding you?
Smelly cat, smelly cat
It's not your fault
That's too much. Sorry.
Okay. What is it about me? Do I not look fun enough?
Is there something repellent about me?
How was the party?
It couldn't have been worse. A woman literally passed through me.
So, what is it? Am I hideously unattractive?
No, you are not. You are very attractive.
I go through the exact same thing.
Every time I put on a little weight, I question everything.
Whoa, whoa.
I've put on a little weight?
Did you want to? Yeah, uh...
No, not weight. More like insulation.
Chandler, I'm unemployed, in dire need of a project.
Wanna work out? I can remake you.
Uh, I would, but that might get in the way of my lying-around time.
Please?  Come on, let her do it!
All right. But if we put on spandex...
...and my boobs are bigger than yours, I'm going home.
Your boobs are fine. Look, I never should have said anything. Come here. Come here!
Ooh, can't make hands meet!
Friends S02E07: The One Where Ross Finds Out
Okay! Let's do it.
What?
Nothing. Just never seen you in little stretchy pants before.
And we're changing.
Unh!  Come on, give me five more!  Ugh. Aah!
Five more! No.
Five more and I'll flash you.
One...
...two...
...two and a half.
Just show me one of them.
Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow.
Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow.
She's insane! The woman is insane.
It's before work, after work, and during work.
She's got me doing butt-clenches at my desk.
And now they won't bring me my mail anymore.
Hey, Pheebs. How'd it go with Scott?
Oh, um, it was nice. Took him to a romantic restaurant...
...ordered champagne. Nice.
The guy still won't put out? Nope. Zilch. Nothing. Uh-uh.
Sorry, Pheebs.  Sorry, Pheebs.
Well, look, I don't mind taking it slow. I like him a lot.
He's really interesting, and he's really sweet.
Why won't he give it up?
Maybe he, uh, drives his car on the other side of the road.
If you know what I mean.
No. What do you mean? He's not British.
Maybe he's gay. Oh!
Um, no, I don't think that's the problem.
We went, um, dancing the other night...
...and just the way he held me so close and the way he was looking into my eyes...
...I just definitely felt something.
Yeah, but how much can you tell from a look?
No, I felt it on my hip. I could tell.
Yo, Bing! Racquetball in 20 minutes.
Joey, be a pal. Lift up my hand and smack her with it. Heh.
Ooh. Oh, Rachel! Don't look. What?
Come on, guys. I don't care. I have a date tonight.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. You have a date? Yeah. Monica's setting me up.
Heh, now, what about, uh, Ross and...
What? My whole insane jealousy thing?
Well, you know, as much fun as that was...
...I've decided to opt for sanity.
So you're okay about all this?
Oh, yeah, come on! I'm moving on.
He can press her up against that window as much as he wants.
For all I care, he can throw her through the damn thing.
Hi, guys.Hey.
Monica, I figured I'd come by tomorrow and pick up Fluffy's old cat toys, okay?
Only if you say his full name.
Can I come over tomorrow and pick up Fluffy Meowington's cat toys?
All right. You're getting a cat?
Actually, we're getting a cat. Heh.
Together? Uh-huh.
Both of you? Together? Yup.
It'll live with Ross half the time and me half the time.
Oh, well...
...isn't that just lovely? Ha, ha.
That's something the two of you will be able to enjoy...
...for a really, really, really long time.
Hopefully.Oh, wow.
Whoa! Look at that. I gotta go! I got a date!
With a man. Ahem, okay.
You guys have a really, uh, good night...
...and you two have a, uh, really good cat. Heh.
We're not supposed to take these when we leave.
I don't know if Monica told you... ...but this the first date I've gone on since my divorce.
So if I seem a little nervous... ...I am.
How long do cats live?
I'm sorry? Cats. How long do they live?
Figuring you don't throw them under a bus or something?
Um, maybe 15, 16 years. Well, that's just great.
Um, cheers. Mm.
Right. Clink. Heh.
Monica told you I was cuter than this, didn't she?
Oh, no, Michael, it's not you.
Sorry. It's just... It's this thing.
It's probably not as bad as it sounds...
...but this friend of mine is getting a cat with his girlfriend.
Oh, that does sound...
Huh. He just started going out with her.
Ahem. Is this guy, uh, an old boyfriend?
Yeah, he wishes.
Oh, I'm sorry. Look at me.
Okay, Michael, let's talk about you.
All right. Okay. Okay?
So...
Did you ever get a pet with a girlfriend?
So I figured it out.  What?
Why Scott doesn't want to sleep with me.
'Cause I'm not sexy enough.
Heh, Phoebe, that's crazy.
When I first met you, you know what I said to Chandler?
Mm-mm. I said, "Excellent butt, great rack."
Really? That's so sweet.
I mean, I'm officially offended. But that's so sweet.
Look, if you wanna know what the deal is, you're gonna have to ask him.
You're right. You're right.
Ugh, you are so yum!
I mean, it's a cat, you know? It's a cat.
Why can't they get one of those bugs? One of those fruit flies.
Those things that live for a day. What are they called? What are they called?
Fruit flies?  Yes!
Thank you. Would you like any dessert?
No! No dessert.
Just the check. Please.
Oh, no. You're not having fun, are you?
No, no, I am.
but only because for the last hour and a half I've been playing the movie Diner in my head.
Oh, look at me.
Look at me.
Oh, I'm on a date with a really great guy.
All I can think about is Ross... ...and his cat...
...and his Julie.
I just want to get over him. God, why can't I do that?
Oy.
Look, I've been through a divorce. Trust me, you're gonna be fine.
You can't see it because you haven't had closure...
Aah!
Closure!
That's what it is. That's what I need.
God, you're brilliant!
Why didn't I think of that? How do I get that?
Well, there's no one way really, it's just...
Whatever it takes so that you can finally say to him:
"I'm over you."
Over you.
That's what it is.
Closure.
Hello? Excuse me?
Excuse me. Hel... Whoo!
Hang on.  Hello? Excuse me?
What? Hi. I'm sorry.
I need to borrow your phone for just one minute.
I'm talking.  I see that.
It's one phone call, I'll be very quick. I'll even pay for it myself.
Okay, you're being a little weird about your phone.
All right. Fine.
I'll call you back.
Thank you.
Okay.
Machine.
Just waiting for the beep.  Good.
Ross! Hi, it's Rachel.
I'm just calling to say that, um...
...everything's fine. And I'm really happy for you...
...and your cat.
Who, by the way, I think you should name Michael.
And you see there, I'm thinking of names...
...so obviously I am over you.
I am over you.
And that, my friend, is what they call "closure."
No, no, no, no, no, no.
No!
Monica, it's Sunday morning. I'm not running on a Sunday.
Why not?  Because it's Sunday!
It's God's day.
Ha, hey. If you say stop, then we stop.
Ha, ha, okay.
Stop.
No, come on! We can't stop! We got three more pounds to go!
I am the energy train and you are on board
Whoo.
Hey, Rach. Mm.
Oh. And how was the date? Ugh.
Um, I think there was a restaurant.
I know there was wine.
Wow. Well, uh...
Uh, actually, Julie's getting a cab.
I just need the cat toys. Did Monica say?
What? Why are you looking at me like that? Heh.
Ahem, I'm sorry. I don't know, I...
I feel like I had a dream about you last night...
...but I don't remember.
Okay. Heh.
Oh, oh, oh. There they are. Ahem.
Did we speak on the phone? Did you call me?
No. I stayed at Julie's last night.
Huh. - Oh, I haven't even been home yet. Do you mind if I check my messages?
Oh, yeah, go ahead.
Rach, I got a message from you!
Who's Michael?  Oh, my God.
God, Ross, no! Hang up the phone. Give me the phone!...
Give me the...
You're over me?
Oh, God.
Wha...? You're, uh... Oh, God.
You're over me?  Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God.
Oh, my God. Oh...
When...? When were you...
...under me?
Rach.
Rachel, do you?
I mean, were you, uh...?
What?  Okay. Okay, okay.
Well, basically...
...ahem, lately, I've, uh...
Ahem, I've sort of had feelings for you.
You've had feelings for me?
Yeah, so? You had feelings for me first. Whoa, huh.
You know about my...? You know I had...?
You know?
Chandler told me. When did he...? When did he...? When did he?
When you were in China.  China.
Meeting Julie.  Julie.
Julie. That's... Oh, God.
Julie? Julie, right.
Okay, I need to lie down.
No, I'm gonna stand. I'm gonna stand... Okay.
...and I'm gonna walk. I'm walking and I am standing.
Okay, so you, uh?
And now, what? Now...? Now.
Now you're over me?
Are you over me?
That's... That's Julie. That's Julie. Julie.
Hi, Julie. Honey, I've got a cab waiting.
I'll be right down!
Wait, so you're going?
Well, okay, I, uh... I have to. I can't deal with this right now.
I mean, I've, uh... Heh. You know, I've got a cab. I've got a girlfriend.
I'm gonna go get a cat.
Okay. Okay.
Cat!
Hey, Joey.  Hey, Pheebs.
How come you're watching a rabbi play electric guitar?
I can't find the remote.
Ugh, thank you. Heh.
So, Scott asked me to come over for lunch and I did.
And? And we did.
All right, Pheebs! Way to go! Yay, me. Ha, ha.
So how did it happen?
I finally took your advice and asked him what was going on.
What did he say?  He said that...
...he understands how sex can be a very emotional thing for a woman.
And he was just afraid that I was going to get all, you know:
"Is he gonna call me the next day?" And "Where is this going?" and:
So he said he wanted to hold off until he was prepared to be serious.
Yeah. So I said,
"Okay. Relax, please." You know?
I mean, sex can be just about two people right there in the moment.
If he wants to see me again, he can call. If not, that's fine too.
So after a lot of talking, heh...
...I convinced him. Heh!
Let me get this straight. He got you to beg to sleep with him.
He got you to say he never has to call you again.
And he got you thinking this is a great idea?
Uh-huh.
This man is my god.
Good night.
Hi. I didn't get a cat.
Oh, that's, um, interesting.
No. No, it's not interesting. Okay? It's very, very not interesting.
It's actually a hundred percent the opposite of interesting.
I got it, Ross.
You had no right to tell me you ever had feelings for me.
What?  I was doing great with Julie before I found out about you.
I was doing great before I found out about you!
You think it's easy for me to see you with Julie?
You should've said something before I met her.
I didn't know then. And how come you never said anything to me?
There was never a good time.
You only had a year. And we only hung out every night!
Not... Not... Not...
...every night.
It's not like I didn't try. But things got in the way.
You know, like Italian guys... ...or ex-fiancés, or... Or... Or...
Italian guys.
There was one Italian guy, okay? And do you have a point?
The point is, I don't need this right now!
Okay? It's too late.
I'm with somebody else. I'm happy. This ship has sailed!
You're just gonna put away feelings or whatever it was you felt for me?
I've done it since ninth grade. I've gotten good at it.
All right, fine. You go ahead and do that, Ross.
I don't need your stupid ship!
Good.  Good!
And you know what? Now I got closure!
Try the bottom one.
Monica, it's 6:30 in the morning.
We're not working out. It's over.
No way! With one pound to go? Come on!
We're workin', we're movin' We're in the zone, we're groovin'
Okay, I don't mind the last pound.
In fact, I kind of like the last pound.
So don't make me do anything that I'll regret.
Ha, oh, what you gonna do, fat boy, huh? Ha, ha.
What? Heh.
Nothing. Except tell you, uh, it's wonderful how much energy you have.
Well, thanks.
Especially considering how tough it's been for you to find work.
Well, you know. Heh.
You know, I mean...
...you can't tell your parents you were fired, because they'd be disappointed.
Uh-huh.
It's not as if you have a boyfriend's shoulder to cry on.
Well, no. But I...  I mean...
...if it were me, I'd have difficulty getting out of bed at all.
You know, I try to stay positive.
So you?
You feel like going for a run?
All right.
Because you don't have to. You could just take a nap right here.
Okay.
Just for a little while. Okay.
Ross kissed me.  No!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
It was unbelievable!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
We wanna hear everything.
Monica, get the wine and unplug the phone.
Okay.  Rachel.
Does this end well or do we need to get tissues?
Oh, it ended very well. Oh.
Do not start without me! Do not start without me!
Okay. All right. Let's hear about the kiss.
Was it like a soft brush against your lips...
...or was it like a, you know, "I gotta have you now" kind of thing?
Well, at first it was really intense, you know? And then...
Oh, God. And then we just sort of sunk into it.
Oh... So, okay, was he holding you? Or were his hands on your back?
No, actually, ahem, first they started out on my waist...
...and then they slid up and then they were in my hair.
Oh. Oh.
And, uh...
And then I kissed her.
Tongue?
Yeah.  Cool.
Friends S02E08: The One With the List
All right, check out this bad boy!
Twelve megabytes of RAM, 500-megabyte hard drive...
...built-in spreadsheet capabilities...
...and a modem that transmits at over 28,000 BPS.
Wow. What are you gonna use it for?
Games and stuff.
There are no jobs. There are no jobs for me.
Oh, wait, here's one. Uh...
Would you be willing to cook naked? There's an ad for a naked chef?
No, but if you're willing to cook naked, then you might be willing to dance naked.
And then... Mm.
Hi. Hey.
Hey.  Oh, so how'd you make out last night?
That is funny. That is painfully funny.
No, wait, wait.
Yeah, that's just painful.
Wait a minute. I thought last night was great.
Yeah, it was. But I get home, okay...
...and I see Julie's saline solution on my night table...
...and I think, "Oh, my God. What the hell am I doing?"
I mean, here I am with Julie, this incredible, great woman...
...who I care about and who cares about me...
...and am I just gonna throw all that away?
You got all that from saline solution?
Wait a minute. We're talking about Rachel here. You and Rachel.
Believe me, I've been dreaming about me and Rachel for 10 years.
But now I'm with Julie.
You know? So it's like, me and Julie, me and Rachel.
Me and Julie, me and Rach...
Rachel! Rachel.
Hey, you. How are you?
Good. How are you?
Good. Um...Good.
Hi, honey. - Hi, Julie. Hi, Julie?
Julie!
Um, how are you?
Good. Good.
So everybody's here.
Everybody's good.
Were you gonna play something?
Oh. Well, actually... Play it!
Oh.
All right.
Julie, I didn't know you wore lenses. What?
Shh.
Okay. Um, hi.
Hello. Hi. Okay.
So, um... Ahem.
This is a song, um, about a love triangle...
...between three people I made up.
Um, it's called, um, "Two of Them Kissed Last Night."
There was a girl We'll call her Betty
And a guy Let's call him Neil
Now I can't stress This point too strongly
This story isn't real
Now our Neil must decide Who will be the girl that he casts aside?
Will Betty be the one Who he loves truly?
Or will it be the one Who we'll call Loolie?
He must decide He must decide
Even though I made him up He must decide
Well, this is a nice résumé.
Nice, nice, nice.
[SPEAKS IN SPANISH THEN CHUCKLES]
Uh, Mr. Rastatter, what does this job entail? The ad wasn't clear.
Mockolate.
I'm sorry? Mockolate.
It's a synthetic chocolate substitute.
Ooh.
Well, go ahead, try a piece.  Oh.
Yeah, we think that Mockolate is even better than chocolate.
All right. Ha, ha.
Mm.
Yeah. Ha-ha-ha.
I love how it crumbles.
You see, chocolate doesn't do that. Ha-ha-ha. No, ma'am.
Anyhoo, we should be getting our FDA approval any day now.
RASTATTER: Ha-ha-ha.
Hopefully, in time for Thanksgiving. Mm.
See, the way we look at it, chocolate dominates...
...your major food-preparation holidays. Easter, Christmas, what have you.
Mm-hm.But we think given the right marketing...
...we can make Thanksgiving the Mockolate holiday.
Wow.
Aren't you gonna swallow that? Ha, ha.
Just waiting for it to stop bubbling. Oh.
Yeah. Isn't that great?
Mm. Ha-ha-ha.
Well, anyhoo, um...
...we're looking for chefs who can create Thanksgiving-themed recipes.
You interested?
Abso...
Ahem... . Lutely!
See, I love creating new recipes, I love Thanksgiving, and, well, now...
...I love Mockolate.
Really? Mm.
Especially that aftertaste. You know, I tell you...
...that'll last you till Christmas.
How about Mockolate mousse?
It's not...
...very Thanksgiving-y.
Okay, how about Pilgrim Mockolate mousse?
What makes it Pilgrim?
We'll put buckles on it.
Hey.  Hey.
Hey.  Did Ross call?
No, I'm sorry.
Why didn't he call?
He's gonna stay with Julie.
He's gonna stay with her and she'll be:
"Hi, I'm Julie. Ross picked me.
We'll get married and have lots of kids and dig up stuff together!"
No offense, but that sounds nothing like her.
I don't know what I'll do. What am I gonna do? This is like a complete nightmare!
Oh, I know. This must be so hard. "Oh, no! Two women love me!
They're both gorgeous and sexy, my wallet's too small for my 50s...
...and my diamond shoes are too tight!"
Hey, here's a thought, Ross... - Don't ever touch the computer.
Ross, listen. I got two words for you:
Threesome.
Right, look. Let's get logical about this. We'll make a list.
"Rachel and Julie: Pros and Cons."
Oh.  Oh.
We'll put their names in bold with different fonts...
...and I can use different colors for each column.
Can't we just use a pen?
No, Amish boy.
Let's start with the cons because they're more fun.
Ha-ha-ha. Rachel first.
I don't know.
I mean...
All right, I guess you can say she's a little spoiled sometimes.
You could say that.
Yeah.
I guess, you know, sometimes she's a little ditzy, you know?
And I've seen her be a little too into her looks.
Uh. Oh, and Julie and I have a lot in common...
...because we're both paleontologists, right?
But Rachel's just a waitress.
Waitress.
Got it. You guys wanna play "Doom"?
Or we could keep doing this.
What else?
I don't know.
Oh, her ankles are a little chubby.
Okay, let's do Julie.
What's wrong with her?
She's not Rachel.
Okay. This is pumpkin pie with a Mockolate crust.
This is Mockolate cranberry cake, and these are Mockolate-chip cookies.
Just like the Indians served.
Oh, my God!
"Oh, my God" good?
Oh, my God! I can't believe you let me put this in my mouth.
Oh! Ugh!
Sweet Lord! Oh, this is what evil must taste like!
I'm telling you, this thing won't print.
Yes, I pressed that button, like, 100 times.
You know, for a hotline, you're not so hot.
What is that in the background?
Are you watching Star Trek?
Hey.
So how'd it go with Julie? Did you break her heart?
Yes.
It was horrible. She cried, I cried. She threw things, they hit me.
Mm.
I did the right thing.
So Spock actually hugs his father?
Hey, do you guys have...?
Hi.  Hi.  Hi.
Where you going?
I just got back from, uh...
From Julie's.
Oh.
No, no.
Uh, it's not what you think. Um...
It's the other thing.
Well, heh, ahem, what's the other thing? What do I think?
Well, uh...
He broke up with Julie!
Well, go hug her, for God's sakes!
Really?
Really.
It's always been you, Rach.
Oh, God.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh, this is good.
This is really good. I know. I know.
It's almost...
What do you say we go take a walk? Just us. Not them.
Okay. Let me get my coat.Okay. No, hey, whoa, whoa.
I'll get your coat.
Okay.
He's going to get my coat. He's going to get my coat, Joey!
Oh, my God, you guys, I can't believe this! This is unbelievable!
What's that? What? Nothing!
What? I saw my name. What is it? No, no, see? See?
Hey, it's printing!
Hey, it's printing!
What is it? Let me see!
Hey, someone order a coat?
Ross, Chandler wrote something about me and he won't let me see.
He won't? He won't!
Because isn't that...
...the short story you were writing?
Yes, it is a short story...
...that I was writing.
And I'm in it? Well, let me read it.
No!
Come on! - Hey, uh, why don't you read it to her?
All right.
"It was summer.
And it was hot.
Rachel was there. Eh?
A lonely gray couch.
'Oh, look! ' cried Ned.
And then the kingdom was his forever. The end!"
That's it? That's all you wrote? You're the worst writer in the world!
This isn't funny anymore.
There's something about me on that piece of paper, and I want to see it.
No, you don't.
All right, you know what? Fine. If you guys wanna be children, that's fine.
I do not need to see it! Ha!
No, no, no!
Go, go, go!
Ooh.
What is this?
That is...
No, no, no.Ah...
Ross, what is this?
Thank you.Good luck.
Okay. Just remember how crazy I am about you, okay?
"Kind of ditzy"?
Ahem. "Too into her looks"?
"Spoiled"?
A little spoiled. He was supposed to type "little," the idiot!
"Just a waitress"?
Now, that was, uh...
I mean, as opposed to, uh...
The, um... Okay, is this over yet? Rach?
Ah! I do not have chubby ankles!
No! I... No. Rach, Rach...
Okay, look at the other side. Look at Julie's column.
"She's not Rachem"?
No...What the hell's a Rachem?
No, no... Is that some stupid paleontology word...
...that I wouldn't know because I'm just a waitress?
No. Rach, come on! Rach...
Rach! Rach! No, no!
It's "She's not Rachel"! She's not...
Rachel?
My diary. My diary! That's brilliant!
If I'd said it was my diary, she wouldn't have made me read it.
No, that's true. You'd be a great person to have around the day after an emergency.
I cannot believe Ross even made this list.
I know.  What a dinkus!
Hey, cut him some slack. It was Chandler's idea.
What?  What?
Oh, good. I was hoping that would come up.
This was your idea? What?
Let's get some perspective here, okay? These things happen for a reason.
Yeah. You!
All right, Pheebs, back me up here. You believe in that karma crap, don't you?
Yeah. Listen, by the way, good luck in your next life as a dung beetle.
Rach! Whoa...
Rach!
Hey! Uh, open up! Please?
When somebody does not buzz you in, Ross, that means, "Go away."
That doesn't mean, "Climb up the fire escape."
I just want to read you something, your "Pro List."
Not interested.
Okay, okay.
"Number one: The way you cry at game shows. Aw.
Number two: How much you love your friends.
Number three: The way you play with your hair when you're nervous.
Number four: How brave you are for starting your life over.
Number five: How great you are with Ben.
Number six: The way you smell."
What are you doing?
Joey, you wanna open the window?
Oh, yeah.
What are you doing out there? I'm, um...
My gosh, you must be freezing. You know what you need?
How about a nice, steaming cup of hot Mockolate?
Rach, come on, open up.
Rach, come on. Come on. You gotta give me another chance.
No.
No?  That's what I said.
Maybe we should go.
No, you don't have to go. We're done talking.
Rach, come on. I know how you must...
No, you don't, Ross.
Imagine the worst things you think about yourself.
Now, how would you feel if the one person that you trusted the most in the world...
...not only thinks them too...
...but actually uses them as reasons not to be with you.
No, but see, I wanna be with you in spite of all those things.
Oh. Well, that's mighty big of you, Ross.
I said, don't go!
You know what?
If things were the other way around, there is nothing you could put on a list...
...that would ever make me not wanna be with you.
Well, then I guess that's the difference between us.
See, I'd never make a list.
I never know how long you're supposed to wait in this situation before you can talk.
Maybe a little longer.
In some of these recipes, the quantities may seem a little unusual.
Uh, like these coconut Mockolate holiday nut bars?
I've indicated four cups of coconut and four cups of crushed nuts...
...and only one tablespoon of Mockolate.
Doesn't matter.
What?
Our FDA approval didn't come through.
Something about laboratory rats. Huh.
Oh, gosh, I'm sorry. - Yeah. Well, anyhoo, here's your check.
Thank you for all you went through.
Um, listen, you didn't eat a lot of it while you were cooking, did you?
Well, I ate some.
Oh, some. That's fine. Some's not a lot.
Ha-ha-ha. Okay.
So it doesn't burn when you pee, does it?
Hello.
Hi.
Is that him again?
Tell him I'd come to the phone, but my ankles are weighing me down.
Listen, I don't think this is the best time.
Look, can you do something for me?
Sure. What?
Okay.
All right.
Music?
Sure. Okay.
The next one's dedicated to Rachel from Ross.
Rachel, he wants you to know he's sorry for what he did...
...and he hopes you can find it in your heart to forgive him.
Uh, we've just gotten a call from Rachel...
...and she told us what Ross did.
It's pretty appalling. And, Ross, if you're listening...
...I don't wanna play your song anymore.
Why don't we devote our time to a couple that stands a chance?
Avery, Michelle's sorry she hit you with her car...
...and she hopes you two will work it out.
Hi. Thanks for coming in again.
Oh, not at all. I have no morals, and I need the cash.
It's like I'm looking in a mirror. Ha-ha-ha.
Anyway, they're called Fish-tachios.
Now, they taste exactly like pistachios...
...but they're made of reconstituted fish bits.
Here, try one.
All right.  You're not allergic to anything?
Uh, cat hair. Oh, sorry.
Ooh, ooh, ooh.
Ugly Naked Guy is decorating his tree.
Oh, my God, you should see the size of his Christmas balls!
Hey. Hey.
How much did you tip the super?
Yeah, we were gonna give 50, but we don't wanna look bad.
Oh, this year we just made him cookies.
And 25 it is.
Heh. You gave him cookies?
Money is so impersonal. Yeah.
Cookies says someone really cares.
All right, we're broke, but cookies do say that.
I can see that.
A plate of brownies told me a limerick.
Pheebs, let me ask you something. Were these, uh, "funny" brownies?
Not especially.
But, you know, I think they had pot in them.
So, you guys, who else did you tip with cookies?
Uh, the mailman, the super...
Oh, and the newspaper delivery guy.
Oh, my God.
What?
Uh, I don't think you're gonna like this.
Oh, wow.
Oh, gosh.
Oh, these are cookies smashed in the Sports section.
And he did my crossword puzzle.
Yeah, but not very well, unless 14 across, "Gershwin musical"...
...actually is "Bite me, bite me, bite me."
Friends S02E09: The One With Phoebe's Dad
I can't believe it's Christmas already. You know?
One day you're eating turkey, the next thing you know...
...your lords are a-leaping and your geese are a-laying. Heh.
Which is why geese are so relaxed this time of year.
Hey, guys.Hey.
Hey, Rach.
I, uh, got you a little present.
I'll open it.
It's a Slinky!
Ha, ha. Remember, huh?
Walks downstairs Alone or in pairs
Everyone knows it's...
Just a big spring.
You're still mad because of the whole...
Horrible list of reasons not to be with me?
How about we just call it "the unfortunate incident"?
Hey, Gunther. You got stairs in your place?
Yeah.  Go nuts.
Hey, guys.Hey.
What's in the bag?
Mm, just some presents.
Come on, show us what you bought.
You know you want to.
Okay.
This is a picture frame from Ben to my parents.
Oh, that's cute.
Some "Hers" and "Hers" towels for Susan and Carol.
And, uh, I got this blouse for Mom.
Ross, that is gorgeous! Yeah?
Look at these authentic fake medals!
Mom's gonna be voted "best dressed"...
...at the make-believe military academy!
Hey.  Hey.
Happy Christmas Eve Eve. You too.
Oh, my God! Where did you get this?
Uh, Macy's, third floor, home furnishings.
This is my father!
This is a picture of my dad!
Uh, Pheebs, that's the guy that comes in the frame.
No, it's my dad. I'll show you.
I thought your dad was in prison.
No, that's my stepdad.
My real dad's the one that ran out on us before I was born.
How have you never been on Oprah?
Look, see? This is him.
My mother gave me this picture before she died. Same guy!
Honey, uh, this is a picture of the frame guy...
...posing in front of a blue screen with a collie.
It's not a blue screen. It's just...
Maybe it was just really clear that day.
Okay, I have to talk to my grandmother.
Wait a minute, honey! Pheebs.
Whoa.Wow.
I'm trying to get my boss's ex-wife to sleep with me.
Joey.
Oh, but when Phoebe has a problem, everyone's all ears!
FRANCES: Esther Livingston.
Gone!
Um... Hi, Pooh.
Hi, Gram. Ahem, what you doing?
Oh, just updating the phone book.
Um, Gram? Um...
Can I see the pictures of my dad again?
Oh.
Oh, sure, sure.
Uh... Huh, how come?
Just, you know, to see him.
Oh, sure. Here.
All right, uh...
This is the one of your father in a meadow.
And, uh, helping a little boy fly a kite.
And here he is at a graduation.
Another graduation.
Another graduation.
Is this really my father?
Is it really your...?
Well, of course it is.
I smell smoke. Maybe because someone's pants are on fire!
Well, I...
In all the years we've been grandmother and granddaughter...
...you've never lied.
All right, that's not your father. It's a picture of a guy in a frame.
Oh, God.
It was your mother's idea.
She didn't want you to know your real father...
...because it hurt her so much when he left.
I didn't wanna go along with it.
But then she died and it was harder to argue with her.
Not impossible, but harder.
All right. So he's not a famous tree surgeon?
And I guess he doesn't live in a hut in Burma where there's no phones?
Last I heard, he was a pharmacist somewhere upstate.
That makes no sense.
Why would the villagers worship a pharmacist?
Honey.
Oh. Yeah.Yeah.
Anyway, that's all I know.
That...
...and this.
This...
...is the real him.
Oh.
I remember my father all dressed up in the red suit...
...the big black boots and the patent leather belt...
...sneaking around downstairs. He didn't want us to see him...
...but he'd be drunk, so he'd crash into something and wake everybody up.
That doesn't sound like a very merry Christmas.
Who said anything about Christmas?
Hi. - Anyone hear from Phoebe yet?
No, nothing.
I hope she's okay.
I know exactly what she's going through.
How do you know what she's going through?
She told us.
What do you got there, Monica?
Stuff for the party.
Aren't you guys supposed to be shopping?
You didn't buy presents yet?
Tomorrow's Christmas Eve! What are you gonna do?
Don't you have to be Claymation to say stuff like that?
Oh, by the way, Mon, I don't think the mailman liked your cookies.
Here are the ornaments your mom sent.
Well...
Maybe the mailman liked the cookies. We just didn't give him enough.
Monica, pigeons learn faster than you.
Hey, Rach. Ahem.
I think I know what will make you feel better.
How about you make a list about me?
Forget it. I'm not gonna stand here...
...and make a list.
Okay, you're whiny...
...you are obsessive, you are insecure...
...you're gutless. - Heh.
You don't ever just seize the day.
You liked me for a year and you didn't do anything about it.
And, uh... Oh, you wear too much of that gel in your hair.
See, there. You, uh...
All right, you did what I said.
And you know what? Hmm?
You're right. I do feel better.
Thank you, Ross.
Yeah, in Albany. Could I have the number of Frank Buffay?
Okay. Um, in lthaca?
All right, um, Saratoga?
Oneonta?
You know what? You shouldn't call yourself Information!
Hey.
Hello, Grandma. If that is, in fact, your real name.
Come on now, Pooh. Don't still be mad at me.
How's it going? Oh, not so good.
Upstate's pretty big. He's pretty small. You do the math.
Well, I think you're better off without him.
Oh, honey, I know he's your daddy.
But to me, he's still the irresponsible creep...
...who locked up your mom and stole her Gremlin.
I know. I just wanted to know who he was, you know?
Yeah, I know.
Okay.
I wasn't completely honest with you when I told you that, uh, I didn't know...
...exactly where he lived.
What do you mean?
He lives at 74 Laurel Drive in Middletown.
If you hit the Dairy Queen, you've gone too far.
You can take my cab.
Wow.
Thank you.
Nobody else drives that cab. - Uh-huh. Got it.
Oh.
I'm gonna see my dad! Ha-ha-ha.
hank you. - Oh. Ha, ha.
Mm, okay. Oh.
Wish me luck, Grandpa.
Hey.
Phoebe here with the cab yet?
Yeah, she brought the invisible cab.
Hop in!
She'd better get here. The stores close at 7.
It'll be two hours to Phoebe's dad's house...
...they'll meet, chat, swap life stories.
We'll still have plenty of time.
Hey, here she comes!  Hey.
Hey, hey.
Hi.
Hey. Hey.
Can you believe this?
In like two hours I'm gonna have a dad.
Yeah, big stuff.
Okay, let's go. Okay.
Here, you have to hold this. Okay.
"Brake, left. Gas, right"?
Uh-huh, that's my cheat sheet.
Where's my seat belt?  That side doesn't have one.
The paramedics had to cut through it.
Hey. Hey.
Come on, just tell me. Please, please.
For the 16th time, no, I do not think you're obsessive.
Oh, it's hot in here! MONICA: Rach, get the heat.
Ross, turn the heat down, please? - Sure.
There's a difference between obsessive...
Ross, the heat!
Okay. Heat, heat, heat. And I'm the obsessive one?
Okay.
This way is on.
So this is...
...off.
Did you just break the radiator?
No, I was turning the knob and...
...here it is.
Well, put it back!
It, uh...
It won't go back. Ugh. I'll call the super.
Here, let me try.
Oh, oh, that's right. I forgot about your ability to fuse metal.
Hey, it's Funny's cousin...
...Not Funny!
Hi, Mr. Treeger?
It's Rachel Green from upstairs.
Yes, somebody, uh, broke our knob on the radiator...
...and it's really hot in here.
Yes, it's hot enough to bake cookies.
Well, do you think we could have a new one by 6?
What? No, no. Tuesday? We can't wait until Tuesday.
We're having a party tonight.
Okay, tip the man.
If he doesn't like our cookies, too bad.
I won't be blackmailed.
Look, if it gets a little warm...
...it can be a theme party.
Here's a theme: "Come on in, live like bacon!"
Ooh, this is it.
Seventy-four.
Oh, so that's what this is for!
Wow.
This is it. I'm gonna meet my dad.
This is, like, the biggest thing ever, huh?
Yeah. Sure is.
Here I go. I'm going in.
All right!
Good luck, Pheebs.
Okay.
Here I go.
Here I go.
I'm going.
Hi.
Welcome to our tropical Christmas party, heh.
Put your coats, sweaters, pants and shirts in the bedroom.
It's hard to tell because I'm sweating...
...but I use exactly what the gel bottle says.
An amount about the size of a pea. How can that be too much?
Ice?
Ice? Ice squares anyone? Take a napkin.
All right.
Monica. Monica!
Monica, your guests are turning into jerky.
Really? I'm perfectly comfortable.
Ha, ha. Hey! Get in line, buddy. I was next.
Mr. Treeger.
You said there was a party.
Oh, yeah.
Well, hey, welcome to our sauna.
Uh, is it hot? My body always stays cool.
Probably because I have so much skin.
Hey, cheese!
Here's the chance. Monica, give him cash.
Rachel, give him your earrings. Something. Anything!
No, I will not cave.
I'm with Mon.
All right. You know how you say I never seize the day?
Even though he's your super, I'm seizing.
Mr. Treeger?
Here is 50 bucks. Merry Christmas.
Oh, wow.
I didn't get you anything.
Here's five back.
No, that's your Christmas tip.
Oh, do you think there's a chance you can fix that radiator now?
No can do. Like I told the girl...
...I can't get a knob until Tuesday.
Ross? Yeah?
He's playing baseball.
You mean hardball?
Whatever.
What you gonna do?
Excuse me. I'm seizing.
Mr. Treeger?
Here's another 50.
Happy Hanukkah.
Will, uh, this help with the knob-getting?
No.
The place is not open till Tuesday.
Am I not saying it right?
So you really did like my cookies?
Oh, yeah, they were so personal. It really showed you cared.
Nice seizing...
...gel boy.
So, uh...
Is this, uh, mistletoe?
No, uh, that...
That is basil.
Oh.  Yeah.
If it was mistletoe, I was gonna kiss you.
No, it's still basil.
Okay.
How far did you get?  Mailbox.
All right, we're getting closer.  Uh-huh.
What's going on?
It's just, like, a whole mess of stuff.
Like yesterday, my dad was this famous Burma tree-surgeon guy.
And, you know, now he's, uh, a pharmacist guy and...
Well, maybe he's this really cool pharmacist guy.
Yeah, maybe. And I'll knock on the door...
...and he'll hug me, and I'll have a dad.
I'll go to his pharmacy and everyone will be nice to me...
...because, you know, I'm Frank's daughter.
So why not go knock?
Because, I mean, what if he's not this great dad guy?
What if he's still the dirtbag who ran out on my mom and us?
Yeah.Hmm.
You know what?
I've already lost a fake dad this week.
I don't think I'm ready to lose a real one.
Pheebs, that's okay. You took a big step today.
Yeah? Yeah.
Someday, when you're ready, you'll make it past the hedges.
And when you do, he'll be lucky to have you.
You guys.
Sorry about your shopping.
CHANDLER: Oh, that's okay. We'll figure something out.
I know you're not going in there...
...but do you think it'd be all right if I went in and used his bathroom?
That's fine, never mind.
Cool, snow!
Kind of like a blank canvas.
Ho-ho-ho-holy crap, is it hot in here!
You mind if I turn the heat down?
We could have used that kind of thinking earlier!
So, Pheebs, how did it go?
Oh, ahem, I couldn't go in.
Honey, I'm sorry.  Are you okay?
Yeah, it's okay, because I know he's there.
So that's enough for now.
Hey, it's after midnight! Merry Christmas, everyone!
Oh, right! Merry Christmas!
The knob was broken...
...so I turned it off from underneath. I hope that's all right.
Rach, these are for you.
Wiper blades.
I don't even have a car.
Ha, ha. No, but with this new-car smell, you'll think you do.
Okay, Pheebs, your turn.
Toilet-seat covers.
Is that what you were doing while I was getting gas?
Uh-huh.Mm-hm.
You guys!
And for Ross...
...Mr. Sweet Tooth.
You got me a cola drink?
And a lemon-lime!
Well, this is too much. I feel like I should get you another sweater.
And last but not least...
They're ribbed for your pleasure.
Joey, would you slow down?
They're not gonna be sold out of papers at 1:00 in the morning.
I'm excited. I've never gotten reviewed before.
You were so amazing as the king. I'm really impressed. I was.
But you know what?
You might wanna consider wearing underwear next time.
Because when you sat on your throne, you could kind of see your...
...royal subjects.
Here it is. Here it is.
"The only thing worse than the mindless adolescent direction...
...was Joseph Tribbiani's disturbingly unskilled portrayal of the king."
Okay, look. That is one guy's opinion.
All right? Pheebs, read yours. - Okay.
"The only thing worse than the mindless, adolescent direction..."
Does anybody have one from a different paper?
Ross, read yours.
I don't want to.
Joey, honey, they don't know what they're talking about.
Maybe they do.
I've been doing this 10 years and I haven't gotten anywhere.
There's gotta be a reason.
Come on, man, you're just, uh, paying your dues.
No, no, no. It's too hard.
It's not worth it. I quit.
What? That's crazy.
Wait, wait one minute. Wait a minute.
I believe this will change your mind.
"In a mediocre play, Joseph Tribbiani was able to achieve brilliant new levels of..."
Continued on page 153.
"...sucking."

When I was little, I wanted to be a veterinarian.
But then I found out you have to put your hands into cows and stuff.
Hi.
Are you okay?
Yeah, just a tough day at work, you know?
Stegosaurus fell over, trapped a kid.
I know this jacket. This is Fun Bobby's jacket.
Where is he? What? He's here, isn't he?
Maybe.  Don't toy with me.
Geller! Hey, Fun Bobby.
Whoa, hey. You been working out?
Not at all.
I love this guy.
I was so psyched to hear you're back with my sister.
You and me both. So, what'd I miss? Come on.
Oh. We were trying to make Joey feel better.
Hey, do you need me to pick you up? - No, I'm all right, man, really.
No, I'm picking you up.
Hey, no, seriously. I don't need you to...
All right, it still works.Okay.
Now, before I go, does anybody else need to be picked up?
I'm still gonna go.
Okay, I'll see you later, babe. Ah.
Public display of affection coming up. You can avert your eyes.
Mm.
See you. Bye.
Fun Bobby is so great.
Oh, isn't he?
I really think this time it may work with him. I mean, he makes me feel so good.
And I've been feeling so lousy, you know, no job, no boyfriend.
Well, at least my cup is half full.
Half full of love.
And for our two-week anniversary, he's gonna take me to his cousin's cabin.
Cabin of love.
We went through a lot of wine tonight, you guys.
Really? I only had two glasses. I just had a glass.
Two. I had one glass.
I had about a mug full in this lovely...
..."I got boned at the Museum of Natural History" mug.
Okay, so that's, what? Two bottles.
And yet somehow we went through five?
CHANDLER: Whoa.
Oh.
So what? So he drank a lot tonight.
Yeah, but, you know, now that I think about it...
...I don't think I've ever seen Fun Bobby without a drink in his hand.
PHOEBE: Yeah. Ooh, ooh, yeah, you know?
Did you notice how he always starts his stories with, um:
"Okay, I was so wasted," or, "Oh, we were so bombed."
Or, um, "So I wake up and I'm in this Dumpster in Connecticut."
Monica, have you ever been with him when he wasn't drinking?
Well, we just happen to go to a lot of places where you might drink.
I mean, how do you go to a wine-tasting without having a drink?
Or to a club, or to the...
...zoo.
Rach, does this have nonfat milk?
Um, I don't know, why don't you taste it?
Mm. No.
Oh, well, too late, you already had some.
What do you say we make these, uh, coffees Irish?
Um, cake.
Yeah, we're gonna... We're gonna get some cake.
You know, it seems like you've been making an awful lot of stuff Irish lately.
I would make them Belgian, but the waffles are hard to get into that flask.
Bobby.
Yeah, okay.
Look, maybe this is none of my business, or maybe it is, I don't know.
But, um, I'm kind of worried about you.
Okay, look, this isn't the first time somebody said something to me about this.
But, I don't know, I always made excuses, like "I'm just a social drinker."
Or "Hey, come on, it's Flag Day."
So, what are you saying now?
I guess I'm saying...
...I'll try and quit.
I kind of like that you worry about me.
So, what's going on?
I am gonna try and quit drinking.
Oh. Why?
Hey.  Hey.
Hey. Hey.
Guess who's back in show business.
Ooh, ooh. Lorne Greene?
No, Pheebs. You know why? Because he's dead.
Oh, no.
Okay, I guess this is gonna seem bittersweet now...
...but Joey, that's who.
Oh, yay! Really?
My agent just called me with an audition for Days of our Lives.
Kick ass.
We have to celebrate. We should do a soap opera theme.
Hey, yeah. We could all sleep together, and then one of us could get amnesia.
Rach, what time do you get off? We're all gonna do something tonight.
Uh, well, actually, I'm already done. Ahem. But I kind of got plans.
You have other friends?
Yeah, I, uh... I have a date.
What?  With a man?
What? What is so strange about me having a date?
What about Ross?
Are you still mad at him because he made that list about...?
No, no, I'm not mad at him.
I'm not really anything at him anymore.
What are you talking about? I don't know.
Whatever I was feeling, I'm... not.
But you guys came so close.
Oh, I know. I'm sorry, you guys. You're gonna have to get used to the fact...
...that I will not be dating Ross.
Here he is. Hi.
Guys, this is Russ.
Hi.
No, no, no. I'm not saying you're not talented. You're very talented.
It's just that with the bird dead and all, there's very little act left.
Oh, honey, give me a break, will you? Oh, oh. I'll talk to you later.
Well, there's my favorite client.
So tell me, darling, how was the audition?
Well, I think it went pretty well. I got a callback for Thursday.
Joey. Have you ever seen me ecstatic?
No. Well, here it is.
Okay. Uh, listen, there's something I want to talk to you about.
The network casting lady...  Oh, isn't Lori a doll?
Yeah, yeah, she's great.
But I kind of got the feeling that she was sort of coming on to me.
And I definitely would get the part if I were to, you know...
lf I would have sent the little general in. Oh.
I see. Well, I'm just gonna put in a call here...
...and we'll find out what's going on and straighten it out.
Yeah, hi. Lori, please.
Hi, darling.
So how about Joey Tribbiani for the part of the cab driver?
Isn't he terrific?
Uh-huh.
Okay, doll, talk to you later.
Yeah, you're gonna have to sleep with her.
What's the matter? Fun Bobby.
What? Isn't he sober?
Oh, he's sober all right.
Just turns out that Fun Bobby was fun for a reason.
Ah. Okay.
All right, here you go, sweetie.
Thanks. You wanna hear something funny?
Oh, God, yes.
There are no hardware stores open past midnight in the Village.
That is funny.
I needed to buy a hammer the other night...
...and I'm out walking around the neighborhood.
But apparently...
...there are no hardware stores open past midnight in the Village.
Uh, say, honey, don't you have to be at your interview?
Oh, yeah.
See you guys.Bye...
...ridiculously dull Bobby.
Oh, my God.  He's not that bad.
Not that bad? Did you not hear the hammer story?
Okay, okay, don't get all squinky.
Maybe it was just the kind of story where you had to be there.
But I'm gonna be there.
For the rest of my life.
I can't break up with him. I made him quit drinking.
He's dull because of me.  All right, don't say that.
He's probably always been dull. You just, you know...
...set it free.
Hi. Hey, Ross. Ah.
Hi, Russ.
I've just got two more tables to clean, and then we'll go, okay?
Okay. I'll just sit here and, uh...
...chat with your, uh...
...friend-type people.
Rachel? Um, hi.
Hi.  Okay.
So you know what you're doing, right?
Ha, ha. Waitressing?
Well, yeah. But, no. I mean, um...
Doesn't Russ just remind you of someone?
Huh. Bob Saget?  Oh, yeah.
No, no, no. Oh, oh.  Hi.
Oh, my, oh.
What...? What's wrong?
I... Okay. She's just upset because she, uh...
She buttered a spider into her toast this morning.
Mm-hm.
All right.
Listen, Pheebs. This is gonna be okay.
Ross, Russ. Russ, Ross.
Hi.  Hi.
Are you a, uh, friend of Rachel's?
Yes. Yes, I am.
Are you a, uh, friend of Rachel's?
Actually, I'm, uh, kind of a...
...you know...
...a date-type thing...
...of Rachel's.
A date? Yeah. I'm her date.
Oh. Oh, you're, uh...
Oh, you're the date.
You know, this is actually good...
...because if we ever lose Ross, we have a spare.
Oh. You are the, uh, paleontologist.
Yes. Yes, I am. And you are a...
Periodontist.
See? Now they're as different as night and...
...later that night.
Well, I am going to, uh, get a beverage. Heh.
Uh, it was nice, uh, meeting you. Ditto.
I, uh... Well, I met Russ.
Oh.
Hey, I didn't know we were, uh, seeing other people.
Well, we're not seeing each other, so... Huh.
Well, uh, for your information, there's a woman at the museum...
...who's curator of moths and other, uh...
...winged things...
...who's, uh, let it be known that she is drawn to me, much like a...
...you know. Ahem.
Well, so far I've been keeping her at bay, but, uh, if this is the deal...
Yeah, this is the deal.
Okay, well, um, have a nice evening. Thank you.
Russ, are you ready? Yeah.
Bye. Bye.
She's dating?
She's dating?
Yes. Yes, but did you see who she was dating?
What do you mean?
Do you not see it? See what?
I don't know what she sees in that goober.
It takes him, what? Like, I don't know, uh...
...hello, a week to get out a sentence?
Yeah, it's annoying, isn't it?
Yeah.
Hey. Hey.
Whoa, whoa.
I'm guessing you didn't get the part...
...or, uh, Italy called and said it was hungry?
Well, the part's mine if I want it.
Oh, my God.
Yeah. If I'm willing to sleep with the casting lady.
Oh, my...
...God?
Ten years I've been waiting for a break like this, Chandler. Ten years.
I mean, Days of our Lives. That's actually on television.
So, what are you gonna do?
I guess I could sleep with her. I mean...
How can I do that?
Well, I've got a pop-up book that told me everything I needed to know.
I've never slept with someone for a part.
Well, is she...?
Sorry.
Is she good-looking? Yeah.
She's totally good-looking. I mean, if I met her in a bar or something...
...I'd be buying her breakfast.
You know, after having slept with her.
You know, maybe this isn't such a big deal.
I mean, the way that I see it is, you get a great job and you get to have sex.
You know? Throw in a tree and a fat guy, and you've got Christmas.
I just... I just don't think that I want it that way though, you know?
I mean, let's say I do make it, all right?
I'm always gonna look back and wonder if it was because of my talent...
...or because of, you know, the little general.
Didn't you used to call it the little major?
Yeah, but after Denise DeMarco, I had to promote it.
Can I get you something from the bar?
Yes, I would like something.
No. No, thank you.
No, if you want a drink, it's okay with me. I've gotta get used to it.
No, no, really. I wouldn't feel right about it.
Just some water, please.
So the light went out in my refrigerator.Scotch on the rocks with a twist.
I'm sorry.
Hey, we're having some fun now, huh, Ross?
Wanna do another one? Huh, Russ?
Okay. Eleven letters...
...atomic element number 101, ends in "ium."
Dysprosium. Ha, ha. Dysprosium.
Try mendelevium.
And weenie number two has it.
Unless of course 9 Down, "Nights in White Satin" was sung by the Doody Blues.
You don't see it? You actually don't see it?
What? Okay, honey, you're dating Ross.
No, Pheebs, I'm dating Russ.
Russ is Ross. Russ, Ross.
Steve, sleeve.
Okay, no one is named sleeve.
Phoebe, what the hell are we talking about?
Other than their names being similar, I'm sorry, I do not see what you're seeing.
For your information, it's a card sharp, not a card shark.
You could not be more wrong.
You could try, but you would not be successful.
Okay, I'm gonna get some more coffee before the pinching and eye-poking begins.
I know what your problem is. Oh, you do, do you?
Mm-hm. You're jealous.
Uh, of what?
You're jealous because I'm a real doctor.
Hey, you're a doctor of gums.
That's the smallest body part you can major in.
It's like, day one, floss. Day two, here's your diploma.
Now, you listen... No, no.
Let me finish. No, let me finish.
No, you let me fin...
Hi.  Hi.
Ew.
Ew, ew, ew.
Did Joey say what he was gonna do? No.
I don't even think he knew.
Hey, would you sleep with somebody to get a great job?
I don't know. Who would I have to sleep with?
Me.
Why would I have to sleep with you?
It's my game. You want the job or not?
Hi.  Hey.
Good morning. Where you going?
Bobby and I are going away for the weekend. Remember?
Oh.
What's with all the bottles of liquor?
What's going on? Is, uh, Bobby drinking again?
Oh, no, this is not for him. This is for me.
That way, he's still sober, but I find his stories about shoelaces more amusing.
Ugh, God. Even his knock is boring.
Hi. I'll be ready in just a second. Uh, could I talk to you a minute?
Sure.
This is really hard for me to say. Oh, God. You fell off the wagon.
Oh, no, no.
It's about you.
What about me?
I think you may have a drinking problem.
What, these?
No, these are, um, for cuts and scrapes.
Look, I am just not strong enough to be in a codependent relationship right now.
Oh, shoot.
Well, anyway, I hope we can be friends.
Okay.
Take care.
Okay. You too. Bye.
What happened?
Well, we kind of broke up.
Aw.
Does anybody want these?
I'll take one.
Sometimes I like to hold stuff like this and pretend I'm a giant.
Hey.  Hey. How'd the callback go?
Ugh, it was unbelievable. I walked in there and she was all over me.
So, what did you do? - Well, I couldn't do it.
I told her I didn't want the part that way.  Good for you.
Oh, wait, wait, wait. But then after I left her office...
...she caught up with me at the elevator and offered me an even bigger part.
So, and?
So you are now looking at Dr. Drake Ramoray, neurosurgeon...
...recurring in at least four episodes.
All right!
All right, I gotta go shower.
Hi.
Oh, hey. Hi.
I guess you guys heard Rachel dumped me.
Yeah, I'm sorry, man.
All she said was that I remind her too much of somebody.
You have any idea who she's talking about?
Oh, I do. It's Bob Saget.
She hates him.Oh.
Hey. Hey, Julie.
Hey, how are you doing?
Oh. I don't know. I mean, it's definitely weird not being with Ross...
...but I guess I'm doing okay.
Actually, I've got some of his stuff that he, um...
Okay, here's his diaper bag...
...and his, uh, Mr. Winky. Ha, ha. Ha, ha.
And, uh...
Oh.
Him. Hi!
How did everything go? Great.
There was a projectile, uh...
...throwing up incident, but he started it.
Ha, ha. We've gotta go. Okay.
Oh, right. Um...
I've got some news. It's about us.
Oh, you and me? Uh, no. Susan and me.
The other "us."
Okay.
We're getting married.
As in, "I now pronounce you wife and wife" married?
We'd like you to come. We understand if you don't want to.
Why wouldn't I want to come? I had fun at the first wedding.
I just thought that...
Why shouldn't I be happy for you? What would it say about me...
...if I couldn't, uh, revel in your joy?
And I'm reveling, baby. Believe me.
Is your finger caught in that chair?
Mm-hm.
Want us to go? Uh-huh.
Friends S02E11: The One With the Lesbian Wedding
You're clearly bothered by something. Tell me what it is.
This is cool. You're actually on television.
I know. It really hit me last night.
I'm on Days of our Lives.
Then I started thinking about us, and how these are the days of our lives.
Yes!  What?
Carol and Susan's caterer had a bike accident...
...and she's in a full-body cast.
Yes!
They asked me, which is cool since I've never catered...
...and I need the money. Is this a problem?
Would it matter?  You're so great!
Thank you!
You're really not going?  I'm really not.
They already live together. Why do they need to get married?
They love each other.
They wanna celebrate that love with the people close to them.
If you wanna call that a reason.
Who's the bitterest man In the living room?
The bitterest man In the living room?
Hi, neighbor.
I thought you were over this. That has nothing to do with it.
If she were marrying a guy, you wouldn't expect me to go.
If she were marrying a guy, she'd be the worst lesbian ever.
Did I miss it?
No, I'm on right after this guy shoots himself.
Whoa, she's pretty.
And she's really nice.
She taught me about how to work with the cameras...
...and smell-the-fart acting.
I'm sorry, what? Excuse me?
You got so many lines to learn so fast that sometimes...
...you need a minute to remember your next one.
So while you're thinking...
...you take this big pause where you look all intense.
Like this:
Oh.Okay.
Here's my scene! Here's my scene!
Mrs. Wallace?  Yes.
I'm Dr. Drake Ramoray, your sister's neurosurgeon.
Is she going to be all right?
I'm afraid the situation is much more dire than we'd expected.
Your sister's suffering from a...
...subcranial hematoma.
Perhaps we can discuss this further over coffee.
Nice!
For a minute, I thought you were actually smelling something.
Do it again! All right!
That was so good! Do it again.
"Damn it, Braverman! It's right there on the chart!"
I gotta get to work. I got a big dinosaur bone to inspect.
No, that's me.
Oh, right.
Oh. Oh.
Oh, thanks. Couldn't, uh...
Is everything okay?
Um, no. Uh-uh. Um...
One of my clients died on the massage table today.
Oh, my God.
That's a little more relaxed than you want them to get.
Yeah, uh-huh.
Um, she was, you know, 82 years old...
...and her name was, um, Mrs. Adelman.
Oh, honey.
It's just so strange. You know...
...she probably woke up this morning and thought...
...I'll have some breakfast, take a walk, then have my massage.
Little did she know God thought, "Okay, but that's it."
Oh, but the weirdest thing was...
...I was cleansing her aura when it happened.
And when her spirit left her body...
...I don't think it went very far.
What do you mean?
I think it went into me.
This is so hard.
I can't decide between lamb or duck.
Well, lambs are scarier.
Or the movie would've been called Silence of the Ducks.
Okay, who ordered what?
I had the half-drunk cappuccino with the lipstick on the rim.
And this with the cigarette butt in it, is that decaf?
Oh, God.
You're so uptight about your mom coming.
I know. I just don't want her to think that because...
...I didn't marry Barry my life is crap.
Talk about crap, just listen to Stella Neidman...
...tell her story about Rod Steiger for the hundredth time.
Uh, Pheebs? How long do you think this lady will be with us?
I don't know. She obviously has some unfinished business.
Sit up!
There she is!
Mom! Hey, sweetie!
So this is where you work!
Oh, it's wonderful!
Is it a living room? Is it a restaurant? Who can tell?
I guess that's the fun.
Pretty much. Here, meet my friends.
Monica! You look gorgeous!
Oh, my! The last time I saw you, it was eat or be eaten.
Uh, this is Joey.
This is Phoebe.
This is Chandler.
You remember Ross?
Oh, hello, Ross. Hi, Mrs. Green.
What do you think of my daughter, in the apron...
...with the big job!
Oh, Mom!
If you didn't pour the coffee, no one would have anything to drink.
Believe me, sometimes that happens.
This is just so exciting! You know, I never worked.
I went from my father's house to the sorority house...
...to my husband's house. I am just so proud of you!
Really?
I know who you remind me of.
Evelyn Durmer.
That's before the lousy face-lift. Now she looks like Soupy Sales.
Pheebs? Ha, ha. Who's Evelyn Durmer?
I don't know. Who's Soupy Sales?
Oh, my God!
There's an unattractive nude man playing the cello.
Just be glad he's not playing a smaller instrument.
You have some life here, sweetie!
Mom, I realize you were upset when I didn't marry Barry...
...and get the house in the suburbs with all the security.
This is just so much better for me.
I know. You didn't love Barry, honey.
And I've never seen you this happy.
I look at you and I think, "This is what I want."
For me.
Well, not just for you.
What do you mean?
I'm, uh, considering leaving your father.
All right, tell me if this is too cute.
Lesbian wedding, chicken breasts.
Oh, God. I think I'm gonna be sick.
What? It's not like I'm putting little nipples on them.
You had no idea?  None.
They didn't fight?
No, they didn't even talk to each other.
How was I suppose to know they were having problems?
You know, in my day, divorce was not an option.
Hey, look who's up!
I just can't believe this is happening.
When I was little, all parents got divorced.
I figured as an adult, I wouldn't have to worry about it.
Can't you look at this as flattering?
She just wants to be like you.
Well, couldn't she have just copied my haircut?
When my parents divorced, they sent me to a shrink...
...and she told me that kids blame themselves.
But in your case, it's actually kind of true.
Oh, that's him.
Damn. My mail-order grandfather hasn't come yet.
Phoebe? Hi, Mr. Adelman.
Nice to see you.  Thanks for coming.
That's okay. Although you did cut into my busy day of sitting.
Um, do you wanna sit?
No, I spent most of my morning trying to stand up.
What can I do for you, my dear?
Okay, I don't know how to say this, but, um...
...I think when your wife's spirit left her body...
...it, um, kind of stuck around...
...in me.
You're saying my wife is in you?
Yeah. You don't have to believe me, but...
...um, can you think of any unfinished business she had?
Any reason to hang around?
I don't know what to say.
All I can think of is that...
...she used to say that before she died, she wanted to see everything.
Everything?  Everything.
Whoa. That's a lot of stuff.
Oh, wait, I...
I remember she also said she wanted to sleep with me one last time.
I'm sorry. There's laughing in my head.
Worth a shot, huh?
Ha, ha. Look at this.
These are all Halloween, three years ago.
Oh, and look, here's Barry.
He came straight from the office?
Oh, no. That was his costume.
See, he's actually an orthodontist, but he came as a regular dentist.
Um, you guys?
Remember when I said that I don't need your help?
Actually, I think you said:
"Don't touch that and get out of my kitchen."
Really? Weird. Anyway...
I planned really well. I planned and planned.
I just didn't plan enough time to do it.
You want some help? If you want.
Hey. Hey.
What a day.
I took her everywhere.
The Museum of Modern Art, Rockefeller Center...
...the Statue of Liberty.
She's still with you?
Yes. I guess she hasn't seen everything yet.
Be right back. She has to go to the bathroom again.
Such a pretty face!
Oh, this is so much fun. Just the girls.
Do you know what we should do? Does anybody have any marijuana?
God!
Look, no one's smoking pot around all this food.
Well, that's fine.
I never did it. I just thought I might.
What's new in sex?
What's new in sex?
The only man I've been with is your father.
I'm dicing. I'm dicing. I don't hear anything.
This is no offense to your dad, but I was thinking...
...there might be more.
You know what? I cannot have this conversation with you.
All right.
You come here and drop this bomb on me before you even tell Daddy.
Do you want my blessing? Want me to talk you out of it?
Then what do you want?
I guess I figured you would understand.
Why on earth would I understand this?
You didn't marry your Barry, honey.
But I married mine.
Oh.
We're in trouble. We've only got 12 hours and 36 minutes left.
Move, move, move!
I feel like you should have German subtitles.
Joey, speed it up!
I'm sorry! It's the pigs! They're reluctant to get in the blanket!
How did this happen? I thought you had this planned out.
Do you want me to cry?
Is that what you want?
Do you wanna see me cry?
Sir, no, sir!
All right, you!
No. Look, I told you, I am not a part of this thing.
Look, Ross. I know you have issues with Carol and Susan, and I feel for you.
But if you don't help, I'm gonna take those hot dogs...
...and create an appetizer called "Pigs In Ross."
All right, ball a melon!
How come I'm stuck dicing when he gets to ball a melon?
How's it going?  Great! Right on schedule.
Got my happy helpers.
That's fine. Whatever.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
Okay, everything. I think we're calling off the wedding.
You're still gonna pay me, right?
Or something a little less selfish.
What's the matter? What happened?
My parents called to say they weren't coming.
I knew they were having trouble with this, but...
...they're my parents. They're supposed to give me away.
Susan and I fought because I said maybe we should call it off.
She said, "This isn't for them. It's for us."
And if I couldn't see that, we should cancel the wedding.
I don't know what to do.
I, uh, can't believe I'm gonna say this, but I think Susan's right.
You do?
Do you love her? And don't be too emphatic about this.
Of course I do.
Well then, that's it.
If George and Adelaide can't accept that, then the hell with them.
If my parents didn't want me to marry you...
...no way that would've stopped me.
Look, this is your wedding.
Do it.
You're right. Of course you're right.
So we're back on?
We're back on.
You heard the woman! Peel! Chop! Devil!
Can't believe I lost two minutes.
It just seems so futile.
You know? All these women, and nothing!
I feel like Superman without my powers, you know?
I have the cape, and yet I cannot fly.
Well, now you understand how I feel every single day.
The world is my lesbian wedding.
Butterscotch?
No one?
All right, you'll be sorry later.
Aw.
Thank you.  Anytime.
Ross.
Nothing makes God happier...
...than when two people, any two people, come together in love.
Friends, family, we're gathered here today...
...to join Carol and Susan in holy matrimony.
Oh, my God.
Now I've seen everything!
Whoa, she's gone.
She's gone.
Go ahead, get married. Go, go!
Would you look at them?
Yeah. Can't help but.
How's that pig-in-the-blanket working out for you?
I wrapped those bad boys.
I miss Rose.  Oh, yeah?
I know it's kind of weird, but she was a big part of my life...
I don't know, I feel alone.
You know, I, uh, couldn't help overhearing what you just said.
I think it's time you forget about Rose, move on with your life.
How about we get you a drink?
Okay. So nice!
I shouldn't even bother coming up with a line, right?
Hey, Mom, having fun?
Am I! I just danced with a wonderfully large woman.
And three other girls made eyes at me over at the buffet.
I'm not saying it's something I wanna pursue...
...but it's nice to know I have options.
Ahem, there's more alcohol, right?
How you doing?
Okay.
You did a good thing today.
You wanna dance?
No, that's fine.
Come on.
I'll let you lead.
Okay.
Look, penis, schmenis!
Okay? We're all people.
Which one of us is gonna be the first one to get married?
Mon, I was married.
Yeah, me too, technically.  I had a wedding.
Just trying to start a discussion.
Which one do you think will be the last to get married?
Isn't Ben in this?
Of course!  Absolutely.
Can't get the monkey off your back?
Then put it in your mouth...
...with Monkeyshine Beer!
Wow.
Monkeyshine Beer.
Because it's a jungle out there!
That commercial always makes me so sad.
Yeah, but then the guy opens his beer and girls run at him...
...so everything works out okay.
I meant because the monkey in it reminds me of Marcel.
I can see that.
Because they both have those big brown eyes and the little pouty chin.
And the fact that they're both monkeys?
I wonder if I did the right thing, giving him away.
Ross, you had to. He was humping everything in sight.
I mean, I have a Malibu Barbie who will no longer be wearing white to her wedding.
Remember when he'd borrow your hat...
...and when you got it back, there'd be little monkey raisins in it?
When he did it, it was funny. When I did it to my boss's hat...
All of a sudden, I had this big "attitude problem."
Friends S02E12: The One After the Superbowl (A)
Hey. Hey.
Check it out! Guess what I got?  Rhythm?
No. My first fan mail!
Check it out.
"Dear Dr. Ramoray:
Know that I love you and would do anything to have you."
My gosh! "Your not-so-secret admirer, Erika Ford."
Oh, wait.
"P.S. Enclosed, please find 14 of my eyelashes."
You know, in Crazy World, that means you're married.
It's not addressed to Days Of Our Lives. This came to your apartment.
There's no stamp on it. This woman was in our building.
Oh, my God.
I got my very own stalker!
Hey, guys. Hey.
Hey. Ooh.
Where are you off to?
There's this paleontology conference in L.A.
So I figured I'd go and drive down to the zoo and surprise Marcel.
I think he will be surprised. Till he realizes he's a monkey...
...and, uh, you know, isn't capable of that emotion.
Oh, Phoebe? That really cute guy is here again.
Oh? Oh.
Okay, so everyone, ahem...
...pretend I'm telling you a story and it's really funny.
So everyone just laugh. Now!
I know, I know! Oh.
Hello.  Hi.
Oh.
I'm Rob Donan.
Hi, Rob Donan.
I don't know anything about music, but I think you're really great.
Oh, wow. Ha, ha.
Anyway, I schedule performers for children's libraries.
And I was thinking, have you thought about playing your songs for kids?
Oh, I would love to have kids...
...hear me play the songs that I will write for them.
What do you wanna do for dinner?
We could stay in and cook for ourselves.
Hello. It's Erika.
Oh, my God. The stalker!
Never mind. It's open.
Aah! Aah!
Yes, hitting her with a frying pan is a good idea.
We might wanna have a backup plan, though, just in case she isn't a cartoon.
Let's get out of here!
The one time they're not home!
Okay. Okay.
We'll leave. When we pass her...
...she won't know me, because we never met!
That's how radio stars escape stalkers!
She's coming!
It's me. Aah!
Uh, this is it. This is how we're gonna die.
You ready?  Wait, wait, wait!
Hi.
Erika!
Mr. Geller?  Yes, hi.
Hi. Dean Lipson, zoo administrator.
I was told you had a question.
I, uh... I can't find the monkey I donated last year. He's a capuchin...
...answers to the name Marcel?
Ah. I'm afraid I have some bad news.
Marcel has passed on.
Oh, my God. What happened?
Well, he got sick, and then he got sicker...
...and then he got a little better.
But then he died.
I can't believe this!
I'm sorry, Mr. Geller. But you know, there's an old saying:
"Sometimes monkeys die."
It's not a great saying...
...but it certainly is fitting today.
Someone should've called me. I'm sorry.
Look, I know this can't bring him back...
...but here, it's just a gesture.
Zoo dollars?
Yes, and come see the bird show at 4. The macaws wear hats.
Well, it's a lot cuter if your monkey hasn't just died.
Ooh.
I know.
I can't believe Joey's having lunch with his stalker.
What is she like?
Well, you remember Kathy Bates in Misery? Mm-hm.
Well, she looks the exact opposite of that.
And she's not crazy?
Oh, no, no. She's a total wack job.
Yeah. She thinks that Joey is actually Dr. Drake Ramoray.
Oh, my God!
Oh. And he's going out with her?
He cannot pursue this.
Just because this woman thinks she can see Joey through the magical box...
...in her living room doesn't mean she's not a person.
Does she not deserve happiness? Does she not deserve love?
What are you looking at me for? He's the one who wants to boff the maniac.
Are you okay?
No, uh-uh. I'm just nervous.
Maybe if I just picture them all in their underwear...
That's not a good idea. That's the reason the last guy got fired.
Oh.
Yeah.
I'm used to playing for grownups.
Grownups drink their coffee and do their grownup thing, you know.
And kids...
...listen.
It's just a huge responsibility.
What?
Are you gonna kiss me?
I was thinking about it.
Okay.
Yeah, okay. Alrighty. Let's play some tunes!
Hi, everybody. I'm Phoebe.
Hi, Phoebe!
Ha, ha. Okay. Um...
...I'm gonna play, um, some songs about grandparents, okay?
Now Grandma's a person Who everyone likes
She bought you a train And a bright shiny bike
But lately she hasn't Been coming to dinner
And last time you saw her She looked so much thinner
Now your mom and your dad said She moved to Peru
But the truth is she died And someday you will too
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la
Oh, Drake, isn't it amazing?  Yeah, it is.
What?
Well, here we sit, devil-may-care...
...and just a little while ago you were reattaching Simone's spinal cord.
Yeah, that was a tricky one.
In reality...
...that operation takes over 10 hours, but they only showed it for two minutes.
Who's "they"?
No one.
Oh, Drake, you are so talented. Let me see those hands.
Oh, these hands, these beautiful hands. Ha, ha.
Ha, ha. Oh, I could just eat them.
But I won't.Ha, ha.
Good. Otherwise my watch would fall off.
No, seriously.
These hands...
...these miracle, magical, life-giving hands.
Oh, just to be near them, touch them, maybe even lick one?
All right. Ha, ha. Just one. Ha-ha-ha.
Wow.
You're good at that.
Oh, my God! Someone! He's choking!
Is anyone here a doctor?
ERIKA: Oh, yes.
Yes, the best doctor in Salem!
Dr. Drake Ramoray!
Meet me in the nocturnal house in 15 minutes.
Uh, hey, look. I don't really enjoy being with other men that way.
But, um, zoo dollars?
It's about your monkey.
It's alive.
I don't understand. Why didn't you help that man?
Uh, because, uh, I'm a neurosurgeon...
...and that was clearly a case of, uh, uh...
..."foodal chokage."
You know.
I gotta tell you something... No, no, no.
You don't have to tell me anything.
You don't have to explain yourself to me. Oh!
Who am I to question the great Dr. Drake Ramoray?
That's... I should be happy to be near you.
Hey, I...
"Hey" what?
That's it. Just hey!
Like at the end of a dance. Hey!
Hey. Ha-ha-ha.
Hey.
There'll be times when you get older
When you'll want to sleep with people
Just to make them like you But don't
'Cause
That's another thing that you don't wanna do
Everybody!
That's another thing that you don't wanna do
Excellent!  Very informative!
Not at all inappropriate!
Thank you for coming, everybody. There are cookies in the back.
That was great.
The kids loved you.
Yay! I rock!
And you know why? Because you told the truth.
Nobody ever tells kids the truth.
You were incredible!
Ha, ha. But?
How did you know there was a "but"? I sense these things.
It was either "but" or "butter."
The thing is, I think some of the parents...
...they were hoping that...
...you'd play more songs about barnyard animals.
I can do that.
Really?  Yeah.
Because that would be fantastic. Oh.
What? You wanna kiss me?
I'm thinking about it.
Ah, the bat.
Ambassador of darkness.
Flitting out of his cave like a winged messenger.
Sightless specter of the macabre.
Buddy, my monkey?
Oh, yeah, right.
There was a break-in...
...a few months back. Inside job.
Your monkey was taken.
Oh, my God. The zoo told me that my monkey was dead.
Pfft. The zoo!
You believe everything the zoo tells you?
Uh, that's the only thing the zoo's ever told me.
Of course they'll say he's dead. They don't want the bad publicity.
It's all a great big cover-up.
Do you have any idea how high up this thing goes?
That guy Lipson?
Lipson knows?
Hmm.
Lipson knows, huh?
Ah, hello, Mr. Possum.
Enigma of the trees, upside-down denizen of the night.
Taunting gravity...  Buddy, my monkey. My monkey?
Word on the street...
Well, when I say "street," I mean those little pretend streets here at the zoo.
Of course.
Your monkey found a new career...
...in the entertainment field. That's all I know.
This is unbelievable!
So, what is this information worth to you, my friend?
Are you trying to get me to bribe you?
Maybe.
But you already told me everything.
Check it out. He actually is the Monkeyshine monkey.
Oh, wow. So, what are you gonna do?
I'm gonna call the beer company and try to find out where he is.
That's what I did when I lost my Clydesdales.
Okay, hi again!
Hi, Phoebe!
Today, we're gonna start with some songs about barnyard animals.
Oh, the cow in the meadow goes "moo"
Oh, the cow in the meadow goes "moo"
Then the farmer hits him on the head And grinds him up
And that's how we get hamburgers
Now chickens
You're the only one who can save her, Drake!
Damn it! I'm a doctor, I'm not God!
Well, there goes my whole belief system.
It's Erika.
Quick! Quick. Shut off the TV.
Wait, I wanna see what happens!
Uh, I get Leslie out of the coma then we make out.
How can that be? You were just kissing Sabrina.
Rachel, it's a world where Joey is a neurosurgeon.
Hey, Erika. Come in.
How did you get here so fast? I just saw you in Salem.
Right, they, uh, choppered me in. Ha, ha.
What's up?
Oh, you're having a little party too.
Is she here, huh, huh? Who?
Sabrina. I know about you two!
I saw you today, kissing in the doctor's lounge.
It's not what you think. That was...
You told me I was the only one!
All right, look. That's it.
We shouldn't see each other anymore.
I should have told you a long time ago...
...but I am not Drake Ramoray, okay?
I'm not even a doctor. I'm an actor. I just pretend to be a doctor.
Oh, my God. Do the people at the hospital know about this?
Ha, ha. Somebody wanna help me out here?
Oh, I know! I know!
Where am I?
University Hospital...
...the same place you've been for the last 18 years.
How can you be here and there?
Ha, ha. Because it's a television show.
Drake, what are you getting at?
I'm not Drake!
That's right. He's not Drake. He's...
...Hans Ramoray, Drake's evil twin!
Is this true?
Yes! Yes, it is true.
And I know this...
...because he pretended to be Drake to sleep with me!
And then he told me he would run away with me.
And he didn't!
And you left the toilet seat up, you bastard!
Is all this true?
Yes, I'm afraid it is.
You deserve much better than me, Erika.
You deserve to be with the real Drake. He's the one you fell in love with.
Go to Salem. Find him!
He's the guy for you.
Oh, Hans.
Hans?
Hans!
Yo, evil twin!
Right. Uh, goodbye, Erika.
Good luck in Salem.
Take care.
I'll never forget you, Hans.
Ha, ha. All right. The people who threw the water!
Helping you out!
Fired? Why?
The library board has had a lot of complaints from parents...
...about some of the stuff in your songs. I can't believe it!
Did you tell your board about how the kids want to hear the truth?
No.
I see.
Maybe if you just played some regular kiddie songs?
No.
What do you want me to be? Like some...
...stupid, big, like, purple dinosaur?
You don't have to be Barney.
Who's Barney? Eh...
Well, I tracked down Marcel and get this: He's healthy, he's happy...
...and he's here in New York filming Outbreak 2: The Virus Takes Manhattan.
You're kidding!
This is amazing. I know.
I finally get a part on TV, and the monkey's making movies.
Okay. Rachel, I'm ready.
Okay.
Excuse me. Is this where the singing lady is who tells the truth?
Um, yeah, I guess that's me.
She's here!
Sometimes men love women
And sometimes men love men
And then there are bisexuals
Though some just say They're kidding themselves
La-la-la-la. La-la-la-la-la-la-la.
La-la-la-la. La-la-la-la-la, la-la
This is exciting. I haven't seen my monkey in a year.
What, you never look down in the shower?
Oh, please. I'm not allowed to make one joke in the "monkey is penis" genre?
SECURITY GUARD: Back up, please.
Back up. Come on, come on.
Excuse me. Uh, where can we find the monkey?
I'm sorry. It's a closed set.
I'm sorry, you don't understand. I'm a friend of his.
We, uh, used to live together.
Yeah. And I have a timeshare in the Poconos with Flipper.
Ross, there he is!
Hey! Hey, buddy!
Marcel! Marcel!
In the jungle, the mighty jungle The lion sleeps tonight
In the jungle, the mighty jungle The lion sleeps tonight
They won't take you to the vet
You're obviously not Their favorite pet
Smelly cat, smelly cat Smelly cat, smelly cat
It's not your fault  It's not your fault
No
What?  I'm sorry.
What's wrong with that?
Um, ahem, I think you might wanna, like, pick a more masculine note. Heh.
Ah, excuse me, this is a...
Closed set. We know. But we're friends with the monkey, hmm?
Good morning.
Look who I brought!
Your old friend, Harry Elafonte!
Whoa, dude. Burn!
I don't get it.
He seemed so happy to see me yesterday.
Don't take it personal. He's under pressure, starring in a movie and all.
Oh.
How big of a star is Marcel?
In human terms? I'd say...
...Cybill Shepherd.Whoa.
Really? Whoa.
So you guys in the movie or you just really paranoid?
Hey, Sal? Mm-hm?
Jerry wants to know if the monkey's ready.
Excuse me?
Jerry is the director? Which one's he?
The one in the director's chair? Gotcha.
Pheebs, walk with me.
Okay.
Um, why am I walking with you?
Well, uh, we're just going over here so that we can get away from...
...the horrible flesh-eating virus!
For the love of God, woman, listen to me!
Is he looking? Is he looking?
Friends S02E13: The One After the Superbowl (B)
We've got a problem.  Tell me.
I can't do Chris' makeup.
She refuses to acknowledge her mustache.
Is it bad? -It looks like her eyebrow fell down.
Unless we convince her to let me bleach it...
...Jean-Claude Van Damme will be making out with Gabe Kaplan.
I'll talk to her.
I hate actors.
Nice camouflage. For a minute there, I almost didn't see you.
Excuse me. Whoa. Ah!
Uh, is your name Chandler?
Uh, yes, it is.
Chandler Bing.
Do you know me or are you just really good at this game?
I'm Susie Moss.
Fourth grade? Glasses?
I carried a box of animal crackers like a purse?
Susie Moss!
Right! Yeah! Wow!
You look...
Great job growing up.
It's nice to see you don't still wear the cap with the mirrors on it.
Oh, I graduated fourth grade and realized I wasn't a pimp.
Heh, heh. Remember the class play?
You pulled up my skirt and the entire auditorium saw my underpants?
Yes. Back then, I, uh, used humor as a defense mechanism.
Thank God I don't do that anymore.
Oh, my God!  What? What?
It's Jean-Claude Van Damme.
I didn't know he was in this movie. He is so hot!
You think?
The Muscles from Brussels? Wham-Bam-Van-Damme?
Did you see Timecop?
No. Was he any good in it?
Rachel, he totally changed time!
Wow.
So why don't you go talk to him?  Oh. Yeah.
Go tell him he's cute. What's the worst that could happen?
He could hear me.
Oh.
I'm doing it for you. Don't you dare! Don't!
Don't!
Tell him I cook!
Excuse me.
Hi. Ha, ha. Hi.
Um, this is gonna sound kind of goofy. Ha, ha.
But, um, my friend over there...
...who cooks, by the way...
Um, she thinks you're cute. Heh.
You don't think I'm cute?
I don't know. Um...
Do you think you're cute?
We're getting off the track. Um, I was supposed to tell you...
...my friend thinks you're cute.
What should I tell her?
You can tell her I think her friend is cute.
Oh. Ha, ha. Huh?
Whoa. Ha, ha.
Makeup!  Oh, that's me. I gotta go.
Oh, uh...
Okay.
Um, how many times do I have to touch you on the arm before you ask me on a date?
Well, uh, let's try one more.
There you go. Ernie's, 8:00?
I'll be there.
And if things go well, maybe this time...
...I'll get to see your underwear.
No one was around to hear that?
So, what'd he say? Ugh!
What a jerk!
I kept talking about you, and he kept asking me out.
Oh.
Naturally, you know, I said no.
Well...
Thanks, anyway.
He just kept asking...
...and asking, asking, asking...
If you want to go out with him, you can.
Sounds like a jerk to me, but...
Jean-Claude, she said yes! I'll see you tonight!
Thank you.
Then Jean-Claude took me to Crossroads...
...and we hung out with Drew Barrymore.
Oh, man. She's so smoking!
She's got the greatest set of...
No guys around, huh?
Anybody need anything?  Oh, I'll have an espresso.
Oh, I'll get it.
If I ask you to, you'll end up drinking it yourself.
That is so unfair.  I know.
Like you'd drink her coffee after what you did to her with Van Damme?
I have to cancel racquetball tonight.
Marcel's trainer will let me have him for a couple of hours.
You're blowing me off for a monkey?
We can reschedule for Saturday.
Yeah, unless you hook up with a bunch of pigeons.
Hey.
Stick a fork in me...
...I am done!
Uh...
Stick a fork what?
Like when you're cooking a steak.
Oh, I don't eat meat.
How do you know vegetables are done?
Well, you don't. You eat them and you can tell.
Okay, then eat me, I'm done!
Mm.
I've met the perfect woman. - What?
We're sitting on her couch, fooling around...
...and then she turns to me and says:
"Did you ever want to do it in an elevator?"
What did you say?
I believe my exact words were:
How do you know if you wanna do that?
Oh, you just know.
Oh, we gotta go. Got a reservation in 30 minutes.
No, no, no.
What I had planned shouldn't take more than two, three minutes, tops.
Two hundred seconds of passion! We gotta go.
But, um...
...here's an idea.
Have you ever worn women's underwear?
Well, yes, actually...
...but, uh, they were my Aunt Edna's.
And there were three of us in there.
I was thinking it would be, um, kind of sexy...
...if you wore mine tonight at dinner.
You want me to wear your panties?
Could you?
If I was wearing your underwear...
...then, uh, what would you be wearing?
You're swell!
I made Marcel's favorite dish, banana cake...
Ooh. ...with mealworm.
Ah.
Candle. Ha, ha. Ha, ha.
What do you think is gonna happen here tonight?
Hello.
Oh, hi, are you on your way over...?
Oh.
No, I understand. A monkey's gotta work.
It's no big deal.
It's not like I, uh, had anything special planned, you know.
Yeah, okay. Okay. Okay, bye.
Okay. Rachel, why don't you start talking first?
All right. I feel that this is totally unjustified.
She gave me the green light, I did nothing...
Do you think I can't see you in the TV set?
Monica, if there's something you'd like to share...
You had no right to date him!
That's the most ridiculous...  You sold me out!
I did not!  You absolutely...
Would you let me talk!
Did you just flick me?
Well, you wouldn't let me finish and I was...
Ow, that hurt! Ow.
Quit flicking!
Ow! Stop flicking!
You flicked me first!
Ow!
Ow!
Okay, no, no.
Let's not do this!
Come on. Happy thoughts. No! No!
Happy thoughts! Happy thoughts!
No! Ow! No!
Oh! Oh! Oh, God!
Oh! Ow!
Now I'm gonna kick some ass!
Ow.  Ow.
Ow, ow, ow.
All right. Now, I will let go if you both stop.
Oh! You want me to stop seeing him? Uh-huh.
You want me to just tell him you're seeing him instead?
Is that what you want? Okay.
Oh, that's what you want?
Yes.
Fine! Fine!
There we go.
Ow.  Oh.
Ha. If we were in prison, you guys would be, like, my bitches.
Thanks for letting me tag along tonight you guys.
Forget about it.
How you doing there, squirmy? I'm hanging in.
And a little out.
So assistant to the director?
That's an exciting job. You must have a ton of responsibilities...
I don't do the casting.
So, what are you guys gonna eat?
How come all I can think about is putting that ice in my mouth...
...and licking you all over?
Because I went to an all-boys high school, and God is making up for it?
I want you right here...
...right now.
Right now, right here?
Don't you think we're in kind of a public place?
They do have the shrimp.
Oh. Meet me in the bathroom.
I'm going to the bathroom now.
Come on.
All right, mister.
Let's see those panties.
Alrighty.
Ooh. Ooh.
But you know what would be even sexier?
What?
SUSIE: If you didn't have your shirt tucked into them.
Oh.
All right. Now, I would like to see you wearing nothing but them.
Take your clothes off.
But, uh, I hope you realize this means...
...we'll miss hearing about the specials.
Come on, hurry!
Do you want this done quick or done right?
All right, turn around. I wanna see you from behind.
Oh, oh. Somebody's been doing his Buns of Steel video.
So you want me to, uh, clench anything or?
Susie?
Susie?
This, ha, ha, is for the fourth grade.
Huh? What do you mean? What do I mean?
What do I mean?
I mean underpants, mister! That's what I mean!
What? What do you mean?
My skirt...
...you lifted. Kids laughing!
I was Susie Underpants till I was 18!
That was in fourth grade! How could you still be upset?
Well, um...
Call me in 20 years and tell me if you're still upset about this.
I hope you realize you're not getting these underpants back!
I can't believe this. Ha, ha.
Just two weeks ago, I was watching Sudden Death...
...and now I'm on a date with Jean-Claude Van Damme.
Can you beat up that guy?
Yeah.
Can you beat up that guy?  Sure.
Oh, this is so wild.
I gotta admit, I was surprised that you agreed to go on a blind date.
Normally, I would not do it.
Yeah?
What made you make the exception for me?
Rachel told me, uh...
...you were dying to have a threesome with me and, uh, Drew Barrymore.
By the way, Drew has some ground rules and...
Say you're sorry!  No!
Say it!
No! I'm not gonna!
Say it! Say it! Great! Oh!
Rachel.
Say you're sorry or your sweater gets it.
That is my favorite sweater! That is my third-date sweater!
Say you're sorry.
You wanna play? Okay, let's play.
Let's play.
What are you gonna do?
Give me back my sweater or it's handbag marinara.
You don't have the guts.
Yeah? At least I wasn't too chicken to tell some guy he was cute.
Oh, all right, stop! Stop the madness!
This is crazy!
Who can remember why you're fighting in the first place?
Yes, that's right.
But still...
Look at your purse!
Look at your sweater!
Look at yourselves!
I'll help you fix your sweater.
I'll help you...
...throw out your purse.
I'm sorry I made you stop seeing him.
I'm sorry I went out with him when I knew you liked him.
I'm sorry that I borrowed your gloves.
Joey?
Ma?
Joey!
What are you doing here? I thought you guys took off.
She took off with my clothes!
Are you naked in there? Well, not exactly.
I'm wearing panties.
Huh.
You, uh, always wear panties?
No, no. This is the first time.
Wow. Talk about your bad luck!
I mean, the first time you try panties and someone walks off with your clothes.
I was not trying them out. Susie asked me to wear them.
Let me see!
No! I'm not letting you or anybody else see, ever!
All right, all right!
Whoa.
Someone's flossing!
Joey, some people don't like that.
Chandler's wearing panties.
What?
Let me see! You don't have to see!
Hi, tushy!
One of you give me your underpants.  Oh, no.
I'm not wearing any.
How can you not be wearing any?
Oh. I'm getting heat from the guy in the hot-pink thong.
Look, Ross. I'll give you $50 for your underpants.
Hey.
Can I have the milk?  I'm almost done with it.
Keep your panties on.
Hey. Hey.
And I'm in the movie!  Hey.
What happened?  A virus victim called in sick...
...so Cathy recommended me and boom! I'm dying on a gurney!
Hey!  Oh.
Oh, Marcel just finished his last scene, if you wanna go say goodbye.
Uh, that's okay. He's probably got parties to go to and stuff.
You know, he's moved on. That's the way it goes, right?
Oh, my God!
What?
I think I want to write a song about all this.
Oh, yeah? Yeah.
Ooh, except one of the strings on my guitar is broken.
Chandler, can I borrow your G-string?
How long you been waiting to say that?  About 20 minutes!
Can't you see what's going on here? This man is dying!
Cut!
Can't you see what's going on here? This man is dying!
Cut!
Can't you see what's going on here? This man is dying!
Mommy! - Ah.
Can't you see what's going on? This man is dead!
Hey.  Hey.
Hold on a second.
Nice. Nice.
I got you something.
What's this?  Eight hundred and twelve bucks.
I don't know what Big Leon told you, but it's a thousand...
...if you want me for the whole night.
What is this for? Well, I'm making money now.
And this is paying you back for headshots, electric bills...
...and so many slices of pizza I can't even count.
I love you, man.  Well, thanks, man.
Now I can get my pony.
Hey. This is a little extra something for always being there for me.
Wow, I don't know what to say.
Wow, I don't know what to say.
Eh? What do you say? I don't know.
It's a bracelet.
Isn't it? It's engraved too. Check it out.
"To my best bud."
Thanks, best bud.
Put it on. Oh. Now?
No, something this nice should be saved for a special occasion.
No, that's the beauty part. It goes with everything.
When you put this on, you're good to go.
Oh, man!
You are so wearing that bracelet!
I so am!
Oh! Any idea what this will do for your sex life?
It'll probably slow it down at first...
...but once I'm used to the extra weight, I'll be back on track.
Friends S02E14: The One With the Prom Video
This all looks good.  Great.
If I want to call for a reference on your last job?
Oh, that's there on the bottom, see? The manager, Chandler Bing?
All right.
Let's see if you're as good in person as you are on paper. Make me a salad.
A salad? I could do something more complicated.
No, just the salad will be fine.
You got it.
Now I want you to tell me what you're doing while you're doing it.
All right. Well, I'm tearing the lettuce.
Uh-huh. Is it dirty?
Oh, no, no. I'm gonna wash it.
Don't. I like it dirty.
That's your call.
So, uh, what are you going to do next?
I thought that I'd cut up the tomatoes.
Are they firm?
They're okay.  You sure they haven't gone bad?
You sure they're not very, very bad?
Ahem. No, really, they're okay.
You gonna slice them up real nice?
I was going to do them julienne.
I'm out of here!
Hello?
Rachel's not here right now. Can I take a message?
All right. And how do we spell Casey?
Is it like "at the bat" or "and The Sunshine Band"?
Okay, bye-bye.
Hey, who's this Casey?
Some guy she met at the movies.
What does he want with her?
I'm guessing he wants to do a little dance...
...you know, make a little love...
Well, pretty much get down tonight.
I don't know. I don't...
I don't get it! Two months ago, Rachel and I were this close.
Now I'm taking messages from guys she meets at the movies?
I mean, this Casey should be taking down my messages, you know?
Or Rachel and I should be together...
...and we should get some kind of message service.
Hang in there. It's gonna happen.
Now how do you know that?
Because she's your lobster.
Oh, she's going somewhere.
It's a known fact that lobsters fall in love and mate for life.
You know what? You can actually see old lobster couples...
...walking around their tank, holding claws, like...
Hey, you feeling better?
Yeah, I think that fifth shower actually got the interview off me.
So do you have any other possibilities?
Yeah. There is the possibility that I won't make rent.
Monica, if you want, I can lend you money.
No, no. If I couldn't pay you back right away...
...then I'd feel guilty and tense every time I saw you.
Oh. Then why don't you borrow it from Mom and Dad?
You feel guilty and tense around them already.
Might as well make some money off of them.
The man's got a point. Ohh.
What is that sparkly thing?
That thing? It's a, uh...
Yeah, it's a little flashy.
No, no.
No, no. It's not flashy. Not for a goodfella.
Man, that is sharp! That must have cost you quite a few doubloons.
Hi.  Hi.
Hi, darling. So what's this?
Some of your old stuff.
Well, sweetie, we have a surprise for you.
We're turning your room into a gym.
Wow, that is a surprise!
Just one little question. Why not Ross' room?
Gosh, we talked about that...
...but your brother had so many science trophies, plaques, merit badges...
Well, we didn't want to disturb them.
God forbid!
Ohh.  Hi.
Hi, Rachel. Aww.
We were so sorry to hear about your parents splitting up.
Well, they're just separated. You never know! We'll see.
I can't say any of us were surprised.
Your parents have been unhappy ever since we've known them.
Oh. Especially after that incident in Hawaii.
What? What incident?
Um, no, no. I must be thinking of someone else.
Maybe me! Ha!
Don't you have some folding to do? Go fold, dear. Fold. You fold.
Want a refill? No. I'm all right, thanks.
You gotta give me a second. I want to get this just right.
Ahem.
Dude, 11:00, totally hot babe checking you out.
That was really good. I think I'm ready for my penis now.
I know what you're thinking. Dave Thomas, founder of Wendy's.
I'm Gail.  Chandler.
I... I really have to be somewhere, but it was nice meeting you.
What?
This is excellent!
He could've gotten me a VCR or a set of golf clubs.
But no! He has to get me the "woman repeller"!
The eyesore from the Liberace House of Crap!
It's not that bad.  Easy for you to say.
You're not sporting a reject from the Mr. T collection!
Chandler. Chandler.
"I pity the fool that puts on my jewelry! I do! I do!
I pity that fool..." Ay.
Hey, man! We were just doing some impressions.
Do your Marcel Marceau.
That's actually good.
Would you look at that guy?
How long has he been talking to her?
It's like, back off, buddy! She's a waitress, not a geisha.
I think she's okay.
Look at that! See how she's pushing him away and he won't budge?
I'm gonna do something.
We'll get a condo right on the mountain. Ski in, ski out, it's great.
Excuse me? Are you Rachel?
What?
Ross Geller.
God, in your ad you said you were pretty, but wow!
What are you doing?
Oh, my God, is this the wrong day?
I don't believe it!
If it works out, we'll have something to tell the grandkids!
You sure will.
I've gotta go.
Take care. Okay.
See you later. Ohh.
You're welcome.
What?  I was saving you.
Saving me from the pleasant conversation with the interesting man?
From where I was... Okay, Ross, listen to me.
I am not yours to save.
But you are. What?
Uh, well, um... You're my lobster.
Okay. Are you being the blind-date guy again?
No, you're my lobster.
See, um... Lobsters...
Uh, in the tank, when they're old...
...they get with the... They walk around holding the claws.
In the tank! You know, with...
...with the holding and...
Pheebs, you wanna help me with the lobster thing?
Do the claws again.
Rach, forget the lobsters, okay?
Let's talk... What about us?
Ross, there is no "us," okay?
No, but... - No! Listen to me!
I fell for you and I get clobbered.
You then fall for me and I again get clobbered.
I'm tired of being clobbered, you know?
It's just not worth it.
Well, but...
No "but," Ross.
We are never gonna happen, okay? Accept that.
Except... Except that what?
No. No.
Accept that.
Oh.
Hey, man! Look, it's my best bud! How you doing?
Wow. You're getting good at that Marcel Marceau thing.
What do you say we play some ball? You and me, huh? What do you say?
Okay, that's my bad.
If you hated the bracelet, you should have just said so.
Doesn't the fact that I wore it...
...say how much our friendship means to me?
What about the fact that you insulted the bracelet and you made fun of me?
Well, that's the part where I'm a wank.
I was hoping you wouldn't focus on that.
Come on, man! I said I was sorry a hundred times.
I promise, I will never take it off my...
...wrist.
But if you want to stay in there and be mad...
...you just, you stay in there.
You know what the...
I am here, on my knees...
...holding up these couch cushions...
...as a symbol of my sorrow and regret.
Much like they did in biblical times.
Though you may haveth anger now...
You know, that Steffi Graf has quite a tush.
I'm just saying! It's right there!
Hey, guys. Hi, darling.
Where's my grandson? You didn't bring him?
No. He's at Carol and Susan's today.
A woman in my office is a lesbian.
I'm just saying!
Jack, look! There's that house paint commercial that cracks you up!
Where have you been?  Emotional hell.
So did they lend you the money?
No, I haven't asked them yet.
Come on, Monica, do it.
Hey, you guys.
Monica has some news.
So listen, I'm sorry I didn't tell you this before, but...
...I'm no longer at my job. I had to leave it.
Why? Because they made me.
You were fired? What are you gonna do?
Judy, relax. This is our little Harmonica we're talking about.
We taught her well.
Ten percent of your paycheck goes where? In the bank.
So she dips into her savings. That's what it's there for.
She's gonna be fine.
If you need a little extra...
...you know where to find it.
Anything larger back there?
I can't believe it!
Would you stop already?
Get out of the bitter barn and play in the hay.
Oh, you're right. I should play in the hay.
For about the fact I just dropped $400 to replace a bracelet I hated to begin with.
Bring on the hay!
Hey!
I've got something that'll make you happy.
Guess what Gunther found?
PHOEBE: Ohh!
Hey, now you have two!
Oh, now you have two.
What am I gonna do?
Hey.
Hey.
How come you have two?
This one's for you.
Get out! No, I can't.
I know how much this means to you...
...and I also know this is about more than jewelry.
It's about you and me and the fact that we're "best buds."
Wow. Is this friendship? I think so!
Check it out! We're bracelet buddies!
That's what they'll call us!
Okay, here you go. Pay me back whenever you like.
You have dinosaur checks?
Yeah. You get your money and you learn something.
What's wrong with that?
Nothing.
Hey, you're a cheap-a-saurus!
I'm kidding, I'm kidding. Thank you, I'm very grateful.
Hey, Mon, what is this?
Oh, um...
That's my bathing suit from high school. I was a little bigger then.
Oh, I thought that's what they used to cover Connecticut when it rains.
Hey, what's on this videotape?
You got me. Let's put it in.
Hi.  Hey.
Over here, Jack. Okay.
Rachel's coming up the path.
Doesn't she look pretty? Jack?
Can you get this?
Oh, my God!
What is with your nose?
They had to reduce it because of my deviated septum.
Okay, I was wrong. That's what they use to cover Connecticut.
This is us getting ready for the prom. Ah!
We don't have to watch.  Yeah, we do.
Come on! It's fun!
JUDY: Get a shot of Monica.
Where's Monica? Over here, Dad!
Wait. How do you zoom out?
There she is!
Some girl ate Monica!
Shut up! The camera adds ten pounds.
So how many cameras are actually on you?
Oh, you look so great!
RACHEL: So do you! You look beautiful!
Oops. What?
I think I got mayonnaise on you.
Oh, it's just the shoulder, not my dress.
Everybody smile!
Oh, Dad, turn it off!
It is off. It is not! What's with the red light?
It's the off light. Right, Ross?
Looking good, Mr. Kotter.
You look pretty tonight. Oh, thanks.
What are you doing this summer? I'm gonna hang out...
...work on my music.
Is my hook unhooked? These things keep falling down.
Let me see. I don't know.
What are you gonna do...
Oh! The guys are here!
This summer?
Work on your music?
RACHEL: Oh, my God! There's Roy Gublik!
You know, Roy saw Star Wars 317 times.
His name was in the paper.
Where's Chip? Why isn't he here yet?
He'll be here, okay? Take a chill pill.
There.
I just told Rachel that Roy touched my boob.
I can't go to the prom without a date. I can't! It's too late!
If you're not going, then I don't want to go either.
Oh, I'm gonna kick Chip's ass!
I have a wonderful idea.
You should take Rachel to the prom.
Doubtful.
Jack, give me that. Talk to your son.
All right, go on. This thing's heavy.
Your mother's right. Take her. You can wear my tux.
She won't wanna go with me.
JACK: Of course she would! You're a college man!
I don't know. Well, come on.
Don't you wanna find out?
I can't believe I can't go to the prom!
This is so harsh!
Hold my board. Attaboy! Attaboy!
I think we've seen enough.
Let's turn it off.  No, no, no!
Well, I'm not gonna watch.
Come on, kid. Let's go!
My! Are you handsome! Let's show them!
Just a sec, Dad.
Okay, be cool. Just be cool.
Okay, Dad.
Rachel, ready or not, here comes your knight in shining...
Oh, no.
MONICA: Bye! Don't wait up!
RACHEL: Chip!
Oh, dear!
Jack. How do I turn this off?
JACK: Press the button.
JUDY: Which one? Which button? Jack!
The button! The button!
I can't believe you did that.
Yeah, well...
See? He's her lobster!
JUDY: Dance with him!
Mom, I'm hungry!
Dance with your father.
I don't know any of your flashdances, but I'm no slouch on the dance floor.
All right.
Oh, Jack! Oh, Judy!
Oh, Judy!
All right, no peeking. No peeking.
No peeking. No peeking!
All right, all right, but you better be wearing clothes when I open my eyes.
All right. Open your eyes!
Sweet mother of all that is good and pure.
Huh? Days of our Lives picked up my option!
Congratulations! I know! Ha-ha-ha.
Now we can watch Green Acres the way it was meant to be seen.
So, uh, which one is mine?
Whichever one you want, man. Whichever one you want!
Not that one.
Oh, yes!
Oh, yeah! That's the stuff.
Oh.
Do we dare?  We dare.
Oh.
Oh!
Friends S02E15: The One Where Rachel and Ross... You Know
I can't believe two cows made the ultimate sacrifice...
...so you could watch TV with your feet up.
No, they were chair-shaped cows.
They never would have survived in the wild.
This screen is amazing.
Dick Van Dyke is practically life-size. Uh-huh.
Rose Marie really belongs on a smaller screen, doesn't she?
Hi, you guys.Hey.
Hey.
Hey, you.  Hey, you.
Whoa, hey, whoa.Oh.
So, uh, how was your day?
Oh, you know, pretty much the usual.
Uh, sun shining, birds chirping.
Really? Mine too.
Hey, cool! Mine too!
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I gotta get to the museum. So, um...
I'll see you tonight? Okay.
Oh.
Bye, guys!
Bye. Bye.
Tonight? Hey, whoa.
What's tonight?  It is our first official date.
Our first date.
Uh, ha, ha. Hello?
Hi.
Tonight? You're supposed to waitress for me? My catering thing?
Any of that trigger anything? Oh, God, Monica. I forgot!
This is our first date.
Yes, but my mom got me this job. I can be a waitress!
Thank you, thank you. See? Phoebe! Phoebe!
Really, Pheebs? Uh-huh.
You'd have to be an actual waitress.
This can't be like your "I can be a bear cub" thing.
I can be a waitress. Okay, watch this.
Um, give me two number ones, 86 the bacon...
...one Adam and Eve on a raft and wreck them!
It's James Bond!
Sorry we're late. That's okay. Come on in.
Um, I'm sorry, is Monica Geller coming? I was told she was.
Dr. Burke, it's me.
Monica?
My God! You used to be so...
I mean, you've... You must have lost like...
You look great. Thank you.
This is Phoebe. She'll be helping me.
Hi, Phoebe. Nice to meet you.
So how you been?  Great. How have you been?
Oh, obviously you know Barbara and I split up...
...or you wouldn't do the head tilt.
The head tilt?
Since the divorce, everybody asks how I am...
...with a sympathetic head tilt. "How you doing? You okay?"
Oh.
I'm sorry.  No, no.
It's fine. Believe me, I do it too.
I always answer with the "I'm okay" head bob. "I'm okay."
"You're sure?" "Yeah, I'm fine."
I gotta set up the music. I got a new CD changer.
Of course, the divorce only left me with four CDs to change.
Oh, that's too bad.
I'll survive.
Ward. With a reverse.
Uh, two larges, extra cheese on both.
But listen...
...don't ring the buzzer for 19.
Ring 20. Geller/Green.
They'll let you in, okay?
If you buzz our door, there's no tip for you.
Okay, thanks.
Pizza's on the way. I told you we wouldn't have to get up.
What if we have to pee?
I'll cancel the sodas.
Get back out there. It's your party!
But they're so dull. They're all ophthalmologists.
You're an ophthalmologist.
Because my parents wanted me to be. I wanted to be a sheriff.
Ha, ha. That's funny. Cadillac, cataract. I get it.
But you stay out there!
You see? All right, I tell you what.
I'll come get you in five minutes with some sort of, um, kebob emergency.
Okay.
Ah. Better.
Oh, God, here we go.
Hey, want to see them go nuts?
Watch this.
Who needs glasses?
You are so smitten. I am not!
Oh, you are so much the smitten kitten.
Oh.
You should ask him out.  Dr. Burke?
I don't think so. I mean, like, he's a grown-up.
So? You two are totally into each other.
He's a friend of my parents. He's like 20 years older than me.
So you're never gonna see him again?
Not never.
I'm gonna see him tomorrow at my eye appointment.
Didn't you just get your eyes checked? Yeah, but, you know, uh...
...27 is a dangerous eye age.
I'm not saying it was a bad movie. I'm just saying it was a little...
...hard to follow.
I told you there'd be subtitles.
I know.
I just didn't want to wear my glasses on our first date.
Oh.
Monica?
It would help when I'm kissing if you didn't shout my sister's name.
Honey, I'm just checking. Oh.
Ahem. Monica? Mon?
Monica? Mon?
Monica?
What?
What?  I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. It's just, when you moved your hands down to my butt...
...it was like, "Whoa, Ross' hands are on my butt!"
Sorry.
And that's funny why?
Well, it's not. Uh...
I mean, I'm sorry. I guess I'm just nervous.
I mean, it's you.
You know, it's us.  Mm.
I mean, we're crossing that line. It's sort of a big thing.
Well, I know it's big. I just didn't know it was ha-ha big.
Okay.
Okay, my hands were nowhere near your butt.
I know, I know, I know!
I was thinking about when they were there the last time.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Okay, look! Whoa, I promise.
I'm good. I won't laugh anymore. Put your hands back there.
No, see, now I can't, because, uh...
...I'm feeling too self-conscious.
Just one cheek.  No. Ha.
The moment's gone.
I'll back up into your hands.  That's romantic.
Touch it. No.
Oh, come on, squeeze it. No!
Rub it? No.
Oh, come on! Would you just grab my ass?
Wow, look at that. The car is on fire...
...yet somehow its expensive paint job...
...is protected by the Miracle Wax.
You've got a Cheeto on your face, man.
Thanks.
Hey.  Hey.
Ah.
Aren't you supposed to be out with Rachel?
That was 14 hours ago.
So how'd it go?  Well...
Have you ever been, you know, fooling around with a girl...
...and, uh, she started laughing?
Yeah, but, uh, it was 1982...
...and my Flock of Seagulls haircut was tickling her chin.
She laughed at you? Yeah.
I've been wanting this since ninth grade typing.
You know, I just want it to be perfect...
...and right and...
Why isn't that laser beam cutting through the paint?
It's the Miracle Wax! It certainly is a miracle.
Hi, you guys. Hey.
Hey.  Hi.
Listen, I was, um, thinking about...
Listen, can you guys speak up?
It's harder for us to hear you when you lower your voice.
Okay, listen.
I'm sorry about last night. I really want to make it up to you.
No. You know, there's no need to make it up... How?
Well, I was thinking maybe a, um... Ahem, a romantic dinner...
...with, um, candles and wine.
And then, uh, ahem, maybe going back to my place...
...for, um, dessert.
Hmm.
That sounds...
...perfect? Heh.
What's this?  Would you get us a couple of beers?
I'm going to look into your eyes now.
Really?
Yeah, that's my job.
All right. Look up.
Look down.
Now, open your eyes and look down.
That's right.
Look into the light.
Now look at me.
Okay.
Your eyes look good. Those are good eyes.
Good. They feel good.
In my head.
Um, so...
It was great to see you.  You too.
You too.
Okay, um...
Goodbye. Ha, ha.
Drops!  What?
Drops. Here, they're free.
Thanks. Uh, so...
I guess I better be going.
Oh, okay, yeah, I'll see you later.
Thanks again. Oh.
Oh.
We have to get you lazy boys out of these chairs.
Hey, whoa, hey, whoa.  Oh, oh.
You should go outside and be with the three-dimensional people.
No. Inside good.
Outside bad.
You guys are so pathetic.
Oh, Xanadu!
Oh!
She's one of us now.
Hi, you guys.  Hey.
Hey. Hey.
We just wanted to stop by and, uh, say good night.
Good night.
They won't even turn their heads.
All right, you guys. I'm taking off my shirt.
No, she's lying.
Stop sending food to our apartment!
Why are you dressed up?
You're not the only one who has a date.
What? You have a date? Who with? No one.
Come on, what's his name?  Nothing.
Come on, tell me.
All right, but I'm very excited about this, okay?
So promise you won't get big-brothery and judgmental.
I promise. What?
It's Richard Burke. Who's Richard Burke?
Is that Dr...? Dr. Burke?
You have a date with Dr. Burke? Why? Why? Why...
...should that bother me?
I love that man. He's like, uh...
...a brother to Dad.
Well, for your information...
...he is the brightest, most sophisticated, sexiest man I've ever been with.
Dr. Burke is sexy?
Oh, God!
Absolutely!
Damn!
It's the museum again. Can I...? Oh.
You know, Dr. Burke kissed me once.  When?
When I was, um, 7, I crashed my bike right out in front of his house...
...and to stop me from crying, he kissed me right here.
Oh, you are so lucky! I know. Ha-ha-ha.
Australopithecus isn't supposed to be in that display.
No, no.
No, Homo habilis was erect. Australopithecus was never fully erect.
Well, maybe he was nervous.
Oh, look! I can't believe this!
Homo habilis can't use tools yet, and they've got him with clay pots?
Why don't they just give him a microwave? Heh.
I'm sorry this is taking so long.
You know, I... It's longer than I expected. We will have dinner.
That's okay. It's fine. Karl!
Oh, God.
Wow! Is that Michelle?  Yep.
I've not seen her since high-school graduation.
Oh, my God, that night she got so dru...
Emotional.
You know, she's having another baby.  Mm.
I thought she just had one. No, no. Henry's almost 2.
And he's talking and everything. Here.
Aw.
The other day he told me he liked me better than his other grandpa.
In all fairness, his other grandpa's a drunk, but still...
Whoa. You're a grandpa.
Yeah.
Are we nuts here?
I don't know. Maybe.
I mean, I'm dating a man whose pool I once peed in.
I didn't need to know that.
I guess 21 years is a lot.
I mean, hell, I'm a whole person who can drink older than you.
Yeah.
So...
So maybe we should just...  Yeah.
Yeah.
Maybe...
Wow.
This really sucks.
Yeah, it sure does.
Ah.
Uh, we don't really have to decide anything right now, do we?
No, there's no rush or anything.
Pizza delivery!  Oh, I'm gonna kill those guys!
Rach?  Oh.
I'm done. Ah. Ahem.
Yeah, well, you know what? So is, uh, Sorentino's.
I'm sorry. Let's, uh... Why don't we find someplace else?
It's late. Everything will be closed. We'll do it another night.
No, no, we won't.
We won't?
Come on.
Okay, that's dead, right?
What is this? What are we doing? Shh.
Do you want Cran-Apple or Cran-Grape?  Grape.
Okay, now...
...sit.
Okay.
Oh, my God!
Billions ofyears ago, Earth was...
Sorry.
Ah. So, what are we looking at?
Well, uh, you see that little cluster of stars next to the big one?
That is Ursa Major.
Really? No idea. It could be. Could be.
Listen, I'm sorry I had to work tonight.
Oh, that's okay.
You were worth the wait.  Oh.
And I don't just mean tonight.
Whoa.
You're not laughing.
This time it's not so funny.
Aah! Oh!
Okay, loosen the knot. Loosen the knot.
Sorry, sorry.
Aah! Oh, God! Oh.
Honey?
Oh, that's okay.
What?
Oh, no. You just rolled over the juice box.
Oh, thank God!
Hey.
Hey, you.
I can't believe I'm waking up next to you.
I know. It is pretty unbel...
What?  We're not alone.
Is that the fire alarm?  Yeah.
Oh, it's not warm yet. We still have time.
Cool.  Yeah, yeah. Cool!
Man, this is weird.
Ever realize Cap'n Crunch's eyebrows are on his hat?
That's what's weird?
The man's been captain of a cereal for 40 years.
Whoa, yuck!
What?
The spoon! You licked and you put.
You licked and you put.
Yeah, so?
Don't you see how gross that is? It's like you using my toothbrush!
You used my toothbrush?
Only because I used the red one to unclog the drain.
Mine is the red one!
Oh, God! Can open. Worms everywhere!
Why can't we use the same toothbrush...
...but we can use the same soap?
Because soap is soap. It's self-cleaning.
The next time you shower...
...think about the last thing I wash and the first thing you wash.
Friends S02E16: The One Where Joey Moves Out
Hey. Hey.
Look at you fancy lads!
What's the occasion?
You know that guy on my show that's in a coma?
He's having a brunch.
Ready when you are.
I can't believe you're actually getting tattoos.
You guys are getting tattoos?
But you cannot tell Ross because I wanna surprise him.
Wow, this is wild! What are you gonna get?
I'm getting a lily.
For my mom, because her name's Lily.
That's lucky. What if her name was Big Ugly Splotch?
Where you getting it?  On my shoulder.
What?
What's on your shoulder?
A chip.
A tattoo. I'm getting a tattoo. A tattoo?
Why? Why would you wanna do that?
Hi.  Hi.
You don't think they're kind of cool?
No. Sorry, I don't.
Why would anyone pay someone to scar their body for life?
What if it doesn't come out right?
It's like having a bad haircut all the time.
Why is everyone staring at me?
Sign this card for Dad. Richard will be here soon.
Richard's going to the party too?
He's my parents' best friend. He has to go.
So is today the day you'll tell them about you two?
Yeah, for my dad's birthday, I decided to give him a stroke.
No, I think you should tell them.
I don't know how serious he is. Until I do, I won't say anything.
I don't think Mom and Dad would mind.
Remember when you were 9 and Richard was 30, Dad said:
"God, I hope they get together."
ROSS: Shall we?
Okay, wait.
You know what?
Ross, let's switch places. You get in the middle.
This looks like we're trying to cover something up.
You could come in straddling him, they still wouldn't believe it.
We're here!
Hi, kids! MR.The children!
Happy birthday, Dad. Thank you.
Happy birthday!
So you kids thanked Dr. Burke for the ride?
Actually, Mom, I think Monica thanked him for the both of us.
So you kids take the train in?
No, Richard Burke gave them a ride.
Speaking of whom...
...I hear he's got some 20-year-old twinkie in the city.
Finger cramp! Oh, God!
Sorry. Here, let me get that, Mom.
So Richard's shopping in the junior section?
Are we still on that?
You just know she's got the IQ of a napkin.
She's probably not even pretty.
Just young enough so that everything is still pointing up.
Can you believe this place?
I know. This is a great apartment.
In the bathroom there's mirrors on both sides of you.
When you're in there, it's like peeing with the Rockettes.
Well, there's my fantasy come true.
Seriously.
Hey.
We were just saying, great apartment!
Thanks. You want it?
I'm moving to a bigger place.
You should take this one.
Can you see me in a place like this?
Why not? You hate park views and high ceilings?
Come on, I'll show you the kitchen.
That's all right, I saw a kitchen this morning.
On TV.
Stop talking. Okay!
Come on, tell us! Is she really 20?
I am not telling you guys anything.
Come on, it's my birthday. Let me live vicariously!
Dad, you really don't want to do that.
What's a little midlife crisis between friends?
Would you let it go?
I know what you're going through. When I turned 50, I got the Porsche.
You got your own little speedster.
Seriously, it's not like that. Tell you what.
Maybe one of these weekends you can borrow the car and I could...
Dad, I beg you not to finish that sentence!
What? I'm kidding!
You know I'd never let him touch the Porsche.
Okay, Rach.
Which lily? This lily or that lily?
Well, I...  I like this lily.
It's more open and that's like my mom.
She had a more open, giving spirit.
Foghorn Leghorn!
Blond girl? You're in room two.
Not-so-blond girl, you're with me.
Here we go! Uh-huh.
You're not going.
Uh-huh.
Is this because of what Ross said?
No.
Well, yeah, maybe.  I don't believe this.
Is this how this relationship works? Ross equals boss?
Come on, what is this, 1922?
What's 1922?
Just, you know, a long time ago.
When men used to tell women what to do a lot.
Then there was suffrage, which was a good thing. But it sounds horrible.
Do you want this tattoo?
Yes, I do. It's just that Ross...
Is your boyfriend the boss of you?
No.
Who is the boss of you?
You?
No. You are the boss of you!
You march in there and get that tattoo on your hip!
Go!
How you doing?
I'm a twinkie!
Really? I'm a hero.
This is so hard.
Yeah, I know. I hate it too.
Look, maybe we should just tell them.
Maybe we should just tell your parents first.
My parents are dead.
God, you are so lucky!
I mean... Well, you know what I mean.
Just hang in there, okay?
Okay, I'll go out first, all right?
Judy! Going to the bathroom. Good for you!
Thank you, Richard. I appreciate the support.
Honey.
Seen my Harmon Killebrew bat? Bob doesn't believe I have one.
I have no idea.
Did you know Richard has a twinkie in the city?
I know. He's a new man. It's like a scene from Cocoon.
I just never would have pictured Richard with a bimbo.
He told Johnny Shapiro that she's quite a girl.
He told Johnny that he thinks he's falling in love with her.
Really?  I've never seen him this happy.
So, Jack...
...ever think about trading me in for a younger model?
Of course not.
With you, it's like I've got two 25-year-olds.
Oh, Jack, stop!
MR. GELLER: Come on!
It's my birthday!
Can we drop this?
I am not interested in the guy's apartment.
Oh, please. I saw the way you were checking out his moldings.
You want it.
Why would I want another apartment?
I've already got an apartment that I love.
It wouldn't kill you to say it once in a while.
All right. You want the truth? I'm thinking about it.
What?  I'm sorry.
I'm 28. I've never lived alone...
...and I'm at a place where I got enough money...
...that I don't need a roommate.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. I don't need a roommate either.
I can afford to live here by myself.
I may have to bring in somebody once a week to lick the silverware.
Why are you getting so bent out of shape?
We didn't agree to live together forever.
We're not Bert and Ernie.
You know what?
If this is the way you feel...
...then maybe you should take it.
That's how I feel.  Then maybe you should take it!
Maybe I will!
Fine with me!  Great!
You can spend more quality time with your real friends...
...the spoons!
Whose drink can I freshen?
Almost time for cake!
Mon?
Mon, are you okay?
Remember that video of Mom and Dad?  Yeah?
Well, I just caught the live show. Ew!
Hey there.  What?
Nothing. I just heard something nice about you.
Really?
Richard?
Your son isn't seeing anyone, is he?  Not that I know of.
I was thinking, why doesn't he give Monica a call?
That's an idea.
Well, actually, I'm already seeing someone.
Oh? Oh?
Oh...
She never tells us anything.
Ross, did you know Monica's seeing someone?
Mom, there are so many people in my life.
Some are seeing people and some aren't.
Is that crystal?
So who's the mystery man?
Well, he's a doctor.
A real doctor?
No, a doctor of meat.
Of course he's a real doctor.
And he's handsome.
And he's sweet, and I know you'd like him.
Well, that's wonderful.
Mom, it's okay.
It is, Judy.
Jack!
Could you come in here for a moment?
Now!
Found it!  I'll take that, Dad.
It seems your daughter and Richard are something of an item.
That's impossible. He's got a twinkie in the city.
I'm the twinkie.
You're the twinkie?  She's not a twinkie!
Look, this is the best relationship I've been in...
Oh, please! A relationship?
Yes, a relationship!
For your information, I'm crazy about this man.
Really?
Yes.
Am I supposed to stand here and listen to this on my birthday?
This is a good thing. You said you've never seen Richard happier.
When did I say that?
Upstairs in the bathroom, right before you felt up Mom!
SINGING: Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday, dear Jack
Happy birthday to you
It looks so good! Oh, I love it.
I know, so do I! I'm so glad you made me do this.
Okay, let me see yours.
Let's see yours again.
We just saw mine. Let me see yours.
Oh, no!
It's gone! That's so weird.
I don't know how, where it went.
You didn't get it?
No.
Why not?
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
How could you do this to me? This was your idea!
I know! I was gonna get it, but he came in with this needle.
And did you know they do this with needles?
Really? You don't say?
Because mine was licked on by kittens!
Hey.  Hey.
I'm sorry about what...
Yeah, me too.  I know.
Do we need to hug?
No, we're all right.
So I got you something.
Plastic spoons!
Great!  Lick away, my man!
These will go great in my new place till I get real ones.
What?
I can't use these forever. They're no friend of the environment.
No, I mean what's this about your new place?
I'm moving out, like we talked about.
I didn't think that was serious.
You know, I thought that was just a fight.
Well, it was a fight...
...based on serious stuff, remember?
About how I never lived alone or anything?
I think it would be good for me. Help me to grow...
...or whatever.
Well, there you go.
Hey, are you cool with this?
I don't wanna leave you high and dry.
I've never been lower or wetter.
I'll be fine. I'll just turn your...
...bedroom into a game room.
Put the foosball table in there.
Why do you get to keep the table?
I did pay for half of it.
I paid for the other half.
I'll tell you what. I'll play you for it.
All right, you're on.
I can take two minutes out of my day to kick your ass.
Your men will get scored on more times than your sister.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Which sister?
So are you sorry that I told them?
No. It's been a long time since your dad and I went running.
Did you get it?
Is Ross here?  He went out for pizza.
RACHEL: Okay, really quick.
That's great!
Very tasteful.
Wanna see mine? Wanna see mine? Yes!
What? You didn't get one.
Okay. Well then, what is this?
What are we looking at?
That blue freckle?
That's my tattoo.
That is not a tattoo. That is a nothing.
I got her in the chair...
...he barely touched her with the needle, she screamed and that was it.
Okay, hi!
For your information, this is exactly what I wanted.
This is a tattoo of the Earth as seen from a great, great distance.
It's the way my mother sees me from heaven.
Oh, what a load of crap!
That is a dot!
Your mother's in heaven going, "Where the hell's my lily, you wuss!"
That is not a tattoo! This is a tattoo!
You got a tattoo?
Maybe.
But just a little one. Phoebe got the whole world!
Well, let me see.
Well?
Well, it's really...
...sexy.
I wouldn't have thought it would be, but...
...wow!
Really?
Yeah, so...
So is it sore? Or can you do stuff?
I guess.
Save us some pizza.
Get it out of the corner!
Pass it! Pass it!
Stop talking to your men!
Yes!
And the table is mine.
Congratulations.
You guys will still come visit me, right?
Oh, yeah! You got the big TV.
We'll be over there all the time.
Except when we are here.
I know you're just moving uptown, but I'll really miss you.
How can you not be across the hall anymore?
Who's gonna eat all of our food and tie up our phone lines...
Is that my bra?
What are you doing with my bra? It's not what you think.
We used it to fling water balloons off the roof.
Remember? Those kids couldn't even get theirs across the street.
Yeah, I remember.
Let's bring the rest of these down to the truck.
You want me to...
...give you a hand with the foosball table?
Nah...
You keep it. You need the practice.
Thanks.
So...
...I guess this is it.
Yeah, right.
I guess so.
Listen...
When am I gonna see you?
I'm guessing tonight at the coffeehouse.
Right. Yeah. Okay.
Take care.
Huh? So, what do you think?
Casa de Joey.
Huh? I decorated it myself.
Get out. No.
Wow, Joey, this is, uh...
Art.  Art it is.
Well, check this out. Is it a coffee table?
Is it, uh, a panther? There's no need to decide.
Hey, nice pillow.
So tell me, is this genuine Muppet skin?
Hey, excellent water-table thing.
Thanks. I love this. But you know what?
It makes me want to pee.
Yeah, me too. I think that's the challenge. Heh.
Hey, how come, uh, Chandler didn't come?
Well, uh, it's because he had a thing with the...
With the thing.
Right. I got it.
Why don't you show us the rest of your casa?
Yeah.
Uh, oh, oh, the best part. Come on.
Huh?
Hey.
Nice toilet.
No, no, no. Behind it.
You have a phone in here? That's right.
I have a phone.
In here.
Joey, promise me something. Yeah.
Never call me from that phone.
Friends S02E17: The One Where Eddie Moves In
Okay, here we go.
Sorry, they were all out of apple pie. Someone just got the last piece.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. You are not gonna believe this.
I have just been discovered.
Wait a minute. I claimed you in the name of France four years ago.
Anyway.
Promise you won't freak out and say how great this is until I'm done.
Okay. Okay.
Uh, I just met this producer of this teeny record company...
...who said, ahem, that I have a very fresh, offbeat sound...
...and she wants to do a demo of "Smelly Cat."
Okay, I told you not to do that yet. Ha, ha.
Okay.
And she wants to do a video.
I'm not done yet, okay? Ha, ha.
God. Okay.
If that goes well, they may even want to make an album.
I'm done now. Oh,that's great.
That's unbelievable. Oh
Oh, God, Ross, if you care about me, get the pie out of the man's hood.
Get the what? There's a pie in the hood. Go.
What are you doing?  I'm sorry. My pie was in your hood.
I have to get the coffee out of that guy's pants...
...and I'll be back in the hospital by 7.
Damn it, Ross. Get your butt out of the bathroom.
Calm down. I'm blow-drying.
Blow-drying what? You have no hair.
What's going on?
Uh, your boyfriend has been in there for an hour.
It's like I'm living with him again.
He's here when I go to sleep, when I wake up, when I wanna shower.
Uh, I feel like I'm 16 again.
Well, you're not 16. You're both adults now.
Get out, you doofus!
Or, you know, he's rubber and you're glue.
All yours.
I hope you cleaned your hair out of the drain.
I hope you cleaned your hair out of the drain.
Shut up.  Shut up.
Cut it out.
I've never wanted you more.
So, what do you say, boys? Should I call him?
You know what they say:
Ask your slippers a question...
...you're going crazy.
Hello? Hey.
Hey.
Listen, I'm sorry I didn't make it over there today.
Oh, that's okay.
You, uh... You had a thing.
Yeah, well, I hear the place looks great.
Oh, forget about it. I'm having a ball, ha.
How's the apartment doing?
Oh, hey, it's terrific. I mean, it's a regular space...
...fest.
Oh, well, great.
Yeah, I just...
...wanted to call and say hey.
Well, okay, then.
Was that the oven timer?
That's right, my friend.
It's time for Baywatch!  Baywatch!
Oh.
Can you believe they gave Stephanie skin cancer?
I can't believe they promoted her to lieutenant.
You're saying that because you love Yasmine Bleeth.
How could anyone not love Yasmine Bleeth?
Hey. Hey, they're running.
See, this is the brilliance of the show.
I say always keep them running.
All the time running.
Run.
Run.
Run, Yasmine. Run like the wind.
But you wanted to live by yourself.
I did. I thought it'd be great.
I figured I'd have time alone with my thoughts.
But it turns out I don't have as many thoughts as you'd think.
Joey, why don't you talk to Chandler about moving back?
You really think he'd take me?
We had a good talk last night...
...but when I moved out, I hurt him bad.
I promise you, he would definitely want you back.
I'm telling you, there's no way he's moving back.
But we had one of the greatest talks we ever had last night. Heh.
I mean, it was...
It was like when we first started living together.
Look, I know you don't want to hear this right now...
...but we've seen him in his new place. And he's happy.
He's decorated.
Look, Chandler, he has moved on, okay? You have to, too.
No, you're just gonna have to accept the fact that you're just friends now.
You're not...
...roommates anymore.
Okay, Phoebe. Ready to try one?
Okay. Ahem.
Smelly cat, smelly cat
What are they feeding you?
Smelly, smelly, smelly
Really bad smelling smelly cat
Oh, whoa! Oh, my God!
I mean, like, who was that?
They're your backup singers. Behind you, hon.
Oh.
Oh, I thought they were just watching me.
Like at an aquarium, you know?  All right.
From the top.  Okay. Ahem.
Smelly cat, smelly cat
What are they feeding you?
Smelly, smelly, smelly
Really bad smelling smelly cat
It's not your fault
Okay, sorry.
I'm just not getting...
...that everyone, um, gets...
...how smelly this cat actually is.
Maybe if we could talk about this...
...because I need to feel that you really care about the cat.
Honey, we can talk about this.
It's just that it's costing about $100 a minute to be in here.
Oh, okay. So, um, the cat stinks, but you love it. Let's go.
No, there is no way he was a velociraptor.
Look at the cranial ridge, okay?
If Dino was a velociraptor, he'd have eaten the Flintstones.
Yeah. Yeah.
Oh, were you taking a nap?
I was.  Oh, I...
Oh, wait, Tony, can you hold on? That's the other line.
Hello?
Yeah, she's here, but, uh, can she call you back?
Okay, thanks.
Call Joanna. Hi.
Did she leave a number?
Did you see me write one down?
I don't have her number, butt-munch.
Well, she'll call back. Don't be such a baby.
I'm not a baby. You're the baby.
Look, you wanna get off my back? Get out of my face.
Wait, hold on, Tony. Hold on.
Hello?
Hi.
Yeah, no, she's right here. Um, hold on.
Hi, Tony, can I call you back?
That's, uh... That's my sister's boyfriend.
Give me that.
Okay.
Sweetie, before I forget, did I leave my diaphragm at your place?
Hi, Mom.
Hey. Yeah, ha, ha.
So, uh, how's the palace?
It's funny you should mention that because I was thinking...
What's with the boxes?
Oh, uh, actually, I, uh, have some news.
Is that Joey guy gonna pick up his moose hat or should I toss it?
Why don't you ask him yourself? This is my new roommate, Eddie.
EDDIE: Nice to meet you.
Likewise. How you doing?
Uh, I'll take that.
It's, uh, what I came for, heh.
So this is new. Where'd you two meet?
At the, uh, supermarket in the, uh, ethnic-food section.
I helped him pick out a chorizo. Yeah. Ha-ha-ha.
It's a... I mean...  Wow.
We got to talking. And, uh, he needed a place, and I had a spare room.
Oh, now it's a spare room?
Well, yeah. In that it's not being used...
...and I have it to spare.
Right.
Well, I, uh, got what I came for.
I'll, uh... I'll see you guys.
Hey, Joe.
When'd you start using moose in your hair?
Is this guy great, or what?
Yeah.
Yeah, he is.
I can't believe he has a new roommate. Who is this guy?
Uh, Eddie something. He just met him.
It'll never last. He's just a rebound roommate.
Hey. Hey.
Ooh, check it out. Oh, check it out.
It's "Smelly Cat," the video. Oh, God.
Now, okay, I haven't seen it yet, so if you don't like it...
...so what? None of you ever made a video.
Okay.
Get out of here, cat! You stink!
Oh, smoking.  Oh, look at me.
Smelly cat, smelly cat
What are they feeding you?
Smelly cat, smelly cat
It's not your fault
Smelly, smelly, smelly
Really bad smelling smelly cat It's not your fault
Smelly cat, smelly cat
Oh, my God!  I know.
I sound amazing!
WOMAN: They won't take you to the vet
You're obviously not their favorite pet
Smelly cat, smelly cat
It's not your fault
Oh, no
I've never heard myself sing before.
I mean, except in my own head. Oh.
This is so cool. Now I can hear what you hear.
Pretty, uh, different, huh?
Oh, I am sorry, but I'm incredibly talented.
Smelly cat, smelly cat
It's not your fault
Hey, Joey. What's going on, man?
Eddie.
Morning.  Morning.
I just, uh, came by to pick up my mail.
Where's the mail?  Oh, it's, uh, over there on the table.
You don't keep it on this table anymore?
No, Eddie likes it over there.
All right, here you go, my friend. Eggs à la Eddie, huh.
Ooh. Ooh.
Oh, oh. That's great.
Huh.
What?
I thought you liked your eggs...
...with the bread with the hole in the middle, à la me.
I do, but, uh, Eddie makes them this way. They're pretty darn good.
Well, you guys...
...I'm out of here.
See you, pals.
See you.
So how are you two getting along?  Oh, I couldn't be happier.
Great, huh?
I'm happy for you.
All right, that's it!
He just comes in here, Mr. Johnny New Eggs...
...with his moving the mail and his:
"See you, pals."
And now there's no juice!
There's no juice for the people who need the juice. I need the juice!
There's another carton right over there.
Hey, this isn't about juice anymore, all right, man?
All right.
So, what's it about?
Eggs.
Whose eggs do you like better, his or mine, huh?
Well, I like both eggs equally. Oh, come on!
Nobody likes two kinds of eggs equally.
You like one better, and I wanna know which.
What's the difference? Your eggs aren't here anymore.
You took your eggs, and you left!
Did you really expect me to never find new eggs?
I wanna watch Entertainment Tonight.
Tough. We're watching Predators of the Serengeti.
Ugh. Would you guys stop?
It's my TV! What?
Quit it.  Bite me!
Oh, my God.
Well, Monica keeps changing the channel.
Aw, that's great. Why don't you tell Mommy on me?
Now I'm Mommy in this little play?
Look, I refuse to get sucked into...
...this weird little Geller dimension thing, okay?
So I'm gonna go take a nice long hot bubble bath...
...because you kids are driving me crazy!
What do we do about this?
We could tape Entertainment Tonight.
Not that!
This! Us!
Oh, my God, Ross, it's... You're just...
Since you've been here, you're driving... Ow, ow.
Mon, you've gone ultrasonic again, all right?
I just can't stand you being here...
...all the time!
Why? Why can't you stand me being here?
We're just having fun.
Fun? You think this is fun?
Yeah.
I thought we were fooling around, like when, uh... When we were kids.
I hated you when we were kids.
You hated me when we were kids?  Yes.
I hated you.
I loved you in a you're-my-brother- so-I-have-to way...
...but basically, I hated your guts.
Why did you hate me?
Because you were mean to me...
...and you teased me and you always got your way.
That wasn't fun for you?
Uh-huh.
I can't believe you hated me.
But now I love you.
And not just because I have to.
Really?
Yeah.
You're just gonna have to stop pissing me off.
I can do that.
Then I won't have to kill you. Ha, ha.
So you wanna watch, uh, Entertainment Tonight?
Yeah, thanks.
Tonight, America's premier sports magazine...
...moves to primetime...
You know what?  What?
If you really wanna watch that Serengeti thing, we can.
Oh, okay.
Hey. Hey.
Listen, you are not going to believe this...
...but, ahem, that is not me singing on the video.
No.
Yes.
Well, how did you find out?
The record company sent this paper for me to sign saying it's okay...
...for someone else to sing for me. That was my first clue.
So, what are you gonna do?
I can't work with people who would do this.
Sure.
I mean, this poor woman.
What woman?
The voice woman.
She has a great voice, but she doesn't have a video.
Okay, Pheebs, but what about you?
I have a video. Pay attention.
No, this voice woman, she's so talented.
But according to the producer people...
...they said, like, she doesn't have the right look or something. You know?
She's like one of those animals at the pound...
...who nobody wants because they're not pretty.
Or, you know, like some old dog who's kind of like stinky and...
Oh, my God! She's smelly cat!
Oh, oh, that song has so many levels.
Hey, Eddie.
You, uh, wanna play some foosball?
No, thanks, man. I'm not, uh... Not really into sports.
Yeah, okay. All right.
Doesn't matter. Time for Baywatch.
Oh, what?
You like that show?
You don't?
Ha, ha, what...? No.
I mean, it's just pretty people running around on the beach.
Well, that's the brilliance of it.
The pretty people.
And the running.
I'm gonna go read in my room for a little while.
Oh, oh. Okay, man.
Smelly cat, smelly cat
What are they feeding you?
Everybody!
Smelly cat, smelly cat
It's not your fault
Monica. They won't take you to the vet
Chandler.
You're obviously not their favorite pet
Joey.
You may not be a bed of roses
And you're no friend To those with noses
Ross, those are the only lines we have. Sorry.
Okay. Back to the chorus.
Oh, Drake. I'm sorry, Amber.
It's just like Brad to have to have the last word.
I'm sorry I'm late. What happened?  We wanna see the end.
I want you, Drake. I know you do.
But you and I can never be together that way.
What?  There's something I never told you.
I'm actually your half-brother.
What? Huh?
So, what happens next?
Well, I get the medical award for separating the Siamese twins.
Then Amber and I go to Venezuela to meet our other half-brother, Ramon...
...and that's where I find the world's biggest emerald. It's really big.
But it's cursed.
So cool!  God, that is good TV.
Friends S02E18: The One Where Dr Remore Dies
Pheebs, play with me!  No!
This game is grotesque.
Twenty armless guys joined at the waist by a steel bar...
...forced to play soccer forever? Ugh!
Hello? Human rights violation.
Don't feel so bad. After they're done playing...
...I break out the plastic women and everybody has a pretty good time.
Why don't you play with your roommate?
Eh, he's, uh...
He's not a big fan of foosball.
Uh-oh. Ooh. Are we not getting along with the new boy?
No, he's all right. He just, uh, spends most of his time in his room.
Maybe because you haven't taken time to get to know him.
Let's remedy that, shall we?
We don't need to remedy that. - Oh, yeah, it'll be fun!
What was that?  Hi!
Um, I thought it'd be fun if the three of us had beers...
...and got to know each other.
All right. That sounds all right. Oh, good! Okay.
Oh, no, I have to go, because I'm late for my, um...
...Green Eggs and Ham discussion group.
Um, tonight, it's "Why he would not eat them on a train."
Have fun! Bye! That was so lame.
I know. Yeah, heh.
Okay, talk to him. Ahem.
So you, uh, think that Speed Racer guy gets a lot of tickets or?
Ha-ha-ha. That's good. So who broke up with who?
You kidding? I broke up with her.
She actually thought Sean Penn was the capital of Cambodia.
When everybody knows that the, uh, capital of Cambodia is...
Is, uh...
It's not Sean Penn.
All right, I got a funny one. All right?
My last girlfriend, Tilly. We're eating breakfast, right?
I made these pancakes. Like, 50 pancakes.
All of a sudden, she turns to me and says, "Eddie...
...I don't wanna see you anymore." Ha, ha.
It was literally like she had reached into my chest...
...ripped out my heart and smeared it all over my life!
There was this incredible abyss and I'm falling.
I keep falling and I don't think I'm ever gonna stop!
That wasn't such a funny story, was it?
And a crusty old man Said I'll do what I can
And the rest of the rats Played maracas
That's it! Thanks! Good night.
Phoebe's got another job, right? Heh.
Great set tonight, Pheebs. Yes.
I know.
We should get going. Mm.
We should too. I've got patients at 8 in the morning.
You know how we always stay at your apartment?
I thought tonight we'd stay at my place.
I don't know. I don't have my jammies.
Heh.
You don't need them.
My baby sister, ladies and gentlemen.
Shut up. I'm happy.
Oh, this is so nice! I have to make a speech.
Ahem. I just want to say...
...of all the guys that Monica has been with, and that is a lot...
...I like you the best. - Aw.
Thank you, Pheebs. That's very sweet.
You hear that?
She likes me best. And apparently, there have been a lot.
Not a lot.
Phoebe's kidding. Phoebe's crazy.
Phoebe's dead.
Hi.  Hi.
I'm looking for Eddie Manoick.
Oh, uh, he's not here right now. I'm Chandler.
Can I take a message or... Or a fish tank?
Thanks.
Come on in.
I'm Tilly.
Oh.
I gather by that "Oh," he told you about me.
Yeah, your, uh, name came up...
...in a conversation that terrified me to my very soul.
He's kind of intense, huh?
Yes! Hey, can I ask you, is Eddie a little...
A little what? ...bit country?
Come on in, you roomie!
Hello, Tilly.
Eddie, I just came by to drop off your tank.
That was very thoughtful of you.
It's very thoughtful.
Well, okay then.
I'm gonna go. Bye.
Bye.  Bye.
So we getting a fish?
You had sex with her, didn't you?
Pheebs! Check it out, check it out!
Oh, ooh, Soap Opera Digest! That's one of my favorite digests!
Page 42! Page 42!  Okay, okay.
Okay. Ooh. Hey!
"New Doc on the Block, Days ofour Lives Joey Tribbiani."
Yeah. Yeah.  Oh, cool picture!
Ah. Oh, I look good.
Is this true? That you write a lot of your own lines?
Well, kind of, yeah.
Remember last week when Alex was in the accident?
The line in the script was:
"If we don't get this woman to a hospital, she's going to die."
But I made it, "If this woman doesn't get to a hospital...
...she's not gonna live."
Oh, okay. I see what you did there.
Aren't you afraid the writers will be kind of mad when they read this?
Huh.
I never thought about the writers. The scripts just come to my house.
But you know what?
This makes me look good, which makes the show look good...
...which makes the writers look good. So how could they be mad?
WRITER: Makes up most of his lines.
Son of a...
Yeah. Write this, jerk-weed.
I fall down an elevator shaft?
What does this mean? I fall down an elevator shaft?
Uh, I don't know. I just bring the scripts.
They can't kill me! I'm Francesca's long-lost son!
Right.
Uh, could you sign?
No! No way! I'm not signing that!
I don't think that's gonna affect the plot of the show.
How can they do this to me?
All right, uh, I'm just gonna go.
Sorry.
Well, it wasn't that many guys.
If you consider how many guys there actually are...
...it's a very small percentage.  Hey.
It's not that big a deal. I was just curious.
Good night. Good night, Richard.
Good luck, Mon.
All right, before I tell you, uh, you tell me how many women you've been with.
Two. Two? Two? Heh.
How is that possible? I mean...
...have you seen you?
Well, I mean, what can I say?
I was married to Barbara for 30 years, my high-school sweetheart.
Now you. That's two.
Two it is. Heh. Mm-hm.
Okay, time for bed. I'm gonna brush my teeth.
Whoa, no, wait a minute now!
Come on, it's your turn.
Oh, come on!
You know, I don't need the actual number. Just a ballpark.
Okay, it is definitely less than a ballpark.
Wow, I am so glad I'm not Monica right now.
Tell me about it.
So, what's your magic number?
Ahh...
Come on, you know everyone I've been with. All both of them.
Well, ahem, there's you.
Better not be doing these in order.
Okay, uh, Billy Dreskin, Pete Carny.
Ah. Barry.
And, uh, oh, Paolo.
Oh, yes, the weenie from Turinie.
Oh, honey, are you jealous of Paolo?
I'm so much happier with you than I ever was with him.
Really? Oh, please.
That Paolo thing was barely a relationship.
All it really was was just meaningless, animal sex.
Okay, you know, that sounded so much better in my head.
Eddie! I didn't sleep with your ex-girlfriend.
That's exactly what someone who slept with her would say.
This is nuts! Crazy! She came over for two minutes...
...dropped off a fish tank and left! End of story.
Where's Buddy? Buddy?
My fish, Buddy.
There was no fish when she dropped it off.
Oh, this is unbelievable!
You sleep with my ex-girlfriend, insult my intelligence by lying...
...then you kill my fish? My Buddy?
I didn't kill your fish!
Look, Eddie...
Would you look at what I'm doing?
Now that can't be smart.
So we're just gonna take this guy right off you...
...and put him here in Mr. Pocket.
Tangelo?
That's it? That's the giant number you were afraid to tell me?
Well, yeah.  Well, that's not bad at all.
You had me thinking it was, like, a fleet.
You're okay with it?
Oh, honey, I'm fine.
Oh, yay!
Okay, about that two.
What?
All right.
What about my two?
It just seems like a really small number.
Right.
And?  And, well...
Don't you have a lot of wild oats to sow?
Or is that what you're doing with me? Oh, my God! Am I an oat?
Honey, you are not an oat.
I don't know, I guess I'm just not an oat guy.
I've only slept with women I love.
You've only slept with two people.
Right.
Wow.
Oh, wow.
You know I love you too, right?
Now I do.
Ugh, Ross!
Ross, please listen to me.
Ross, you are so much better for me than Paolo ever was.
You care about me, you're loving, you make me laugh.
If I make you laugh, here's an idea.
Invite Paolo to have a romp in the sack, and I'll stand in the corner...
...and tell knock-knock jokes. Ross! Agh!
God, Ross!
What you and I have is special! All Paolo and I ever had was...
Animal sex, animal sex?
So, what are you saying?
There's nothing between us "animal" at all?
There's not even, like, um, a little animal?
Not even, like...
...chipmunk sex?
Okay, Ross...
Try to hear me, okay?
I... Hey. I'm not gonna lie to you.
It was good with Paolo.  Knock-knock.
But what you and I have is so much better.
We have tenderness, we have intimacy, we connect.
You know? I swear.
This is the best...
...I have ever had.
Until now. - Aah!
Oh, hi.  Hi.
Richard told me he loved me.
Oh, my God! I know!
Honey, that's great!
I know! Ha, ha.
I just can't find...  Top drawer.
Hurry. Why? You need one too?
Oh, yeah.
Found them!  Whoo.
There's only one.
Monica!  Hi.
Uh, we'll be right there. We're just trying to decide something.
Rachel?
Hey.  Hey.
They're trying to decide something.  Good. Good, good.
So is, um... So was your mustache... Did it used to be different?
No.  Oh.
How do you, uh, you know, keep it so neat?
I have a little comb.  Oh.
What do you call that?  A mustache comb.
Thank you.
Okay, I will do your laundry for one month.
No!  Okay, okay!
I will, I will, I will...
I will clean the apartment for two months.
I'll give this to you now, if you tell me where we keep the dustpan.
So were you in Nam?
Rock, paper, scissors? - Gotcha.
One, two, three.
Yes! Agh!
Ah! Fine. Go have sex.
RICHARD: No! You have got it completely wrong!
John Savage was Deer Hunter, no legs.
Jon Voight was Coming Home, couldn't feel his legs.
No, you've got it totally the other way around, my friend. Jon Voight...
Honey? Ahem. What? Oh.
Shall we?  It's not gonna happen.
They're doing it tonight. We can do it tomorrow.
Uh, in the future, if I could see the schedule beforehand...
So when I woke up this morning...
...he'd stolen all the insoles out of my shoes!
Why?
He thinks I slept with his ex-girlfriend and killed his fish.
Why would you kill his fish?
Because sometimes after you sleep with someone...
...you have to kill a fish.
Chandler, honey...
...I'm sorry.
Can we watch Joey's show now, please?
Yeah! - Wait. He's not here yet.
He's on the show, he knows what happens.
I'm fine about my problem now, by the way.
Amber...
...I want you to know I'll always be there for you...
...as a friend and as your brother.
Oh, Drake.
DOCTOR: Hard day, huh?
First the medical award, now this?  Yeah.
Some guys are just lucky, I guess. Ha, ha. Ha-ha-ha.
Dr. Ramoray...
...report to first floor Emergency stat. - Hmm.
Well, then...
...l, uh, guess that's me.
Anyone else need to go on the elevator? Dr. Horton? Dr. Wong?
No, no. They only said you.
Oh, okay. All right.
I love you, Drake.  Yeah, whatever.
Oh, no! Drake, look out!
Did they just kill off Joey?  No!
Now maybe.
ROSS: Come on! Open up! We want to talk to you!
I don't feel like talking!
Come on! We care about you.
We're worried about you. And some of us have to pee!
I'm sorry, Joey.
Listen, sorry about your death. That really sucks.
We came over as soon as we saw.  How could you not tell us?
I don't know. I was kind of hoping no one would ever find out.
Well, maybe they could find a way to bring you back.
No, they said that when they found my body, my brain was so smashed in...
...that the only doctor who could've saved me was me.
It's supposed to be some kind of irony.
But Joey, you're gonna be fine.
You don't need that show. It was just a dumb soap opera.
This was the greatest thing that ever happened to me.
Yes! I was going to incorporate that.
Oh, good, here's Monica. She'll have something nice to say.
Um, I straightened out your shower curtain so you won't get mildew.
What? To me, that's nice.
It's gonna be okay. You know that.
No, I don't.
It's like you work your whole life for something...
...and you think that when you get it...
...it'll never be as good as you thought.
But this so was.
It changed everything.
Like, the other day, I got this credit card application...
...and I was pre-approved!
Huh? I've never been pre-approved for anything in my life!
I'm sorry, man.
I don't know if this'll mean anything to you...
...but you'll always be pre-approved with us.
No, that means nothing to me.
Ahh!
Pecan sandy? Just made them.
Yeah, all right.
Are these raisins?
Uh, sure, why not?
Listen, Eddie. Um, ahem.
I've been thinking about our living situation and, uh...
Why are you smiling?
I got a little surprise. Look. There's a new fishy.
I named him, uh...
...Chandler, you know, after you.
Well, that's not even a real fish.
No, that's a Goldfish cracker.
So, what's your point, man?
Okay, good night.
You big freak of nature.
Aah. Hey.
Hey.
Hey.  Hey.
Whoo. Brisk tonight.  Oh, man.
Let's never speak of this.  You got it.
Hey, Eddie. Aah!
What are you doing here? Watching you sleep.
Why?
It makes me feel, um, peaceful.
Ha, ha. Ahem. Please.
I can't sleep now!
Oh, you want me to sing?
No. Look.
That's it. I want you out of the apartment now!
Oh, what are you talking about?
Hannibal Lecter?
Better roommate than you.
No.
I don't think you're being fair! One night you see me, you get scared.
What about the other nights when you don't see me, huh?
Last night you went and got some water...
...and I was nice enough to hide behind the door. What that about, huh?
I didn't realize that. Ah.
Get out now!
Okay. You really want me out?
Yes, please.
Then I want to hear you say you want me out.
I want you out.
I want to hear it from your lips.
Where'd you hear it before?
Oh, right, all right. You know what? Consider me gone.
I'll be out by the time you get home from work tomorrow.
Thank you. I heard that.
Friends S02E19: The One Where Eddie Won't Go
Thanks.  Hey.
Hey.  Hey.
Well, look at you!
Finally got that time machine working, huh?
You like it?
This guy was selling them on 8th Avenue and I thought:
"You know what I don't have?"  A mirror?
Fine, make fun. I think it's jaunty.
Wow! For a guy who's recently lost his job, you're in a good mood.
I'll be all right. I'm not starting from square one.
I was Dr. Drake Ramoray on Days of our Lives.
Huh? That's got to have some kind of cachet.
Cachet? Jaunty?
Chandler gave me word-of-the-day toilet paper.
I'm gonna get some coffee.
Hey. Hey.
Oh! So? Did you read the book?
Oh, my God. It was incredible!
Didn't it, like, totally speak to you?
Whoa, whoa, what book is this? Oh.
Uh! You have to read this book. It's called Be Your Own Wind Keeper.
Ooh. It's about how women need to become more empowered.
And, oh! But there's wind.
And the wind can make us goddesses.
Do you know who takes our wind? Men. They just take it.
Men just take our wind?
Uh-huh. All the time. Because they are the lightning-bearers.
Wow. Yeah.
That sounds kind of cool. It's like The Hobbit.
It is nothing like The Hobbit.
It's like reading about every relationship I've ever had.
Except for Richard.
Oh, yes. No. Richard would never steal your wind.
No. No.
Because he's yummy.  Yes.
But all the other ones.
Oh, and the part about how they're always drinking...
...from our pool of inner power.
But God forbid we should take a sip.
Anybody want a cruller?
This is a typical lightning-bearer thing.
Right there. It's like, um...
..."Hello. Who wants one of my phallic-shaped man-cakes?"
Don't worry about it, already! Things happen.
So you're not mad at me for getting fired and everything?
Joey, look at me.
Look at me!
Do I have lipstick on my teeth?
No.
Uh, can we get back to me?
Look, honey. People get fired left and right in this business.
I already got you an audition for Another World.
All right!
"Cab Driver Number 2"?
You're welcome.
But... But I was Dr. Drake Ramoray!
How can I go from being a neurosurgeon to driving a cab?
Things change. Roll with them.
But this is a two-line part!
It's like taking a step backwards.
I'm not gonna do this.
Joey.
I'm gonna tell you the same thing I told Al Minza...
...and his pyramid of dogs.
Take any job you can get, and don't make on the floor.
I'm sorry.
I'll see you.
Uh, God!
Oh, God! I mean, it's just so...
Isn't it?
Uh. This is like reading about my own life!
This book could have been called Be Your Own Wind Keeper, Rachel!
It wouldn't have sold a million copies...
...but it would've made a nice gift for you.
Hey, you guys. Hey.
Uh, sweetie, we've gotta go.
No!
No? Heh.
No! Why do we always have to do everything according to your timetable?
Actually, it's the movie theater that has the timetable.
It's so you don't miss the beginning.
This isn't about the movie theater. This is about you stealing my wind.
You go, girl!
I can't pull that off, can I?
Excuse me, your wind?
Yes, my wind.
How do you expect me to grow if you won't let me blow?
You know I don't...
...have a problem with that.
Okay.
I just really need to be with myself right now.
I'm sorry.
Mm, mm, mm.Uh, you're right.
I don't have to apologize.
Sorry. Damn it!
What is it? I don't know.
It's got all this stuff about wind and trees...
...and some sacred pool.
I don't really get it. But she's pretty upset about it.
This is why I don't date women who read.
Uh-oh.
What? What's that?
It's my VISA bill.
Envelope one of two.
That can't be good. Open it, open it.
Oh, my God! Whoa!
Look at this! How did I spend so much money?
Uh, that's just the minimum amount. That's your total.
Aah!
Whoa, whoa. Thirty-five hundred dollars at "Porcelain Safari"?
My animals.
The guy said they suited me. He spoke with an accent. I was confused.
Oh.
I don't know what to do!
You can start by driving a cab on Another World.
What?  That audition?
That's a two-line part!
Joey, you owe $1100 at "I Love Lucite."
So what?  So suck it up, man.
It's a job. It's money.
I don't need you getting judgmental and condescending and pedantic.
Toilet paper?  Yeah.
I'm not being any of those things. I'm being realistic.
You're supposed to be my friend!  I am your friend.
Then tell me things like, "You'll be fine."
And "Something big's gonna come along. I know it!"
But I don't know it.
What I do know is you owe $2300 at "Isn't It Chromantic?"
I'm aware of what I owe.
Then get some sense. It took you 10 years to get that job.
How long till you get another?  I don't want to hear this!
I'm just saying...
Well, don't "just say"!
Oh. Maybe I should just go.
Okay.
I'll see you later.
Just think about it.
I don't need to think about it!
I was Dr. Drake Ramoray!
That was huge!
Big things are gonna happen! You'll see!
Ross!
You still there?
Hey, pal. Oh, God!
What are you still doing here?
Uh, just some basic dehydrating of fruits and vegetables.
Man alive, this thing's fantastic!
Aren't you forgetting anything?
Oh, yeah. I got us a new goldfish.
He's feistier than the last one.
Maybe because the last one was made by Pepperidge Farm.
Eddie, isn't there something else you're supposed to be doing now?
Not unless it's got something to do with dehydrating.
Because right now, I'm a dehydrating maniac!
I thought we had a deal.
I thought by the time I got... Uh, uh.
You know what that is?
Your last roommate's kidney?
That's a tomato. Ha, ha.
This one definitely goes in the display.
It's in the display.
Hey, Gunther. Let me get a, uh, lemonade to go.
Lemonade?
You okay, man?
Ahh, it's career stuff.
They killed off my character on the show.
Oh, that's too bad. How'd they do it?
I fell down an elevator shaft.
Oh. That sucks.
I was buried in an avalanche.
What?
I used to be Brice on All My Children.
Why must everybody watch me sleep?
There'll be no more watching me sleep! No more...
...watching! - I...
Neh.
I got some great stuff to dehydrate. Grapes, apricots.
I thought it'd be cool to see what happens with these water balloons.
Get out. Get out, get out, get out!
What?  You! Move out!
Take your fruit! Your stupid small fruit and get out!
You want me to move out? Uh...
Uh-huh.
Heh. I, uh...
Ooh! Ha, ha. I gotta tell you, that's kind of out of the blue, don't you think?
This is not out of the blue!
This is smack-dab in the middle of the blue!
Whoa!
Relax! Take it easy, buddy!
You don't have to tell me twice.
God, I mean, someone will be by for my stuff.
If you think I'm leaving you alone with my fish, you're insane!
You want some help?
No help required, chico!
All the way to the airport, huh? You know, that's over 30 miles.
That's gonna cost you about so bucks.
Excuse me, that's "50" bucks.
What? Five-O dollars.
Oh. You know what it is? It's smudgy because they're fax pages.
When I was on Days ofour Lives as Dr. Drake Ramoray...
...they'd send over the whole script on real paper.
Ha, ha. That's great.
If you wanted to expand this scene, like have the cab crash...
...I could attend to the victims...
...because I have a background in medical acting.
Okay, listen, thanks for coming in.
No. Uh, don't thank me for coming in. Uh, at least let me finish.
Uh, we could take the expressway...
...but, uh, this time of day you're better off taking the budge.
You were going for bridge there, weren't you?
I'll have a good day.
Okay, question number 28.
"Have you ever allowed a lightning-bearer to take your wind?"
I would have to say no.
And I would have to say, "Pah, ha."
What?
Do you not remember the puppet guy?
You totally let him wash his feet in the pool of your inner power.
And his puppet too!
Well, at least I didn't let some guy...
...into the forest of my righteous truth on the first date!
Who?  Paul!
Oh!
Okay, okay, moving on, moving on. Next question.
Okay, number 29.
"Have you ever betrayed another goddess...
...for a lightning-bearer?" Okay, number 30.
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Let's go back to 29.
Not, uh...
Ahem. Not to my recollection.
Danny Arshack, ninth grade.
You know the bottle was pointing at me.
Only because you took up half the circle!
Listen to you two. It's so sad.
Oh!
Looks like I'll be going to the goddess meetings alone.
Mm.
Not when they find out you slept with Jason...
...an hour after he broke up with Monica.
One hour?
You are such a leaf blower! Oh!
Ugh!
Ugh.
Oh, hey, uh, be careful with that 3-D Last Supper.
Judas is a little loose.
Oh, my God! What's going on?
They're taking all my stuff back. I guess you were right.
No, I wasn't right. That's what I came here to tell you.
I was totally hung up on my own stuff the other day.
No, listen. I need the whole security thing, you know?
To know where my next paycheck is coming from. But you don't need that.
And that's amazing to me.
I could never do what you do.
Thanks.  You hold out for something bigger.
I can't tell you how much respect I have...
...for you not going to that stupid audition.
I went. Great! How did it go?
I didn't get it.  Good for you!
You're living the dream!
Huh?  Ha, ha.
All right, then!
Oh, not my parrot.  What?
I can't watch this.
Hey, hold on, hold on.
How much for the, uh? How much to save the bird?
Twelve hundred.  Dollars?
You spent $1200 on a plastic bird?
Uh, it was an impulse buy. Near the register.
Go ahead with the bird.
Do you have anything for around $200? Uh.
The dog.
Huh? Yeah.
I'll take it.
My gift to you, man.
Thanks, Ross!
I really liked that bird, though.
But the dog! Oh!  Yeah. Right?
Here are your cakes.
We didn't order cake.
No, I know. Ahem. They're from me.
You guys, this is not good.
We have enough trouble with guys stealing our wind...
...without taking it from each other.
You're right.You know?
I love you goddesses.
I love you.
I don't ever want to suck your wind again.
Oh.
Thank you. So are we good? Oh. We're good.
We're good?  Yes.
Okay. Let me take these back. They'll take it out of my paycheck.
Ding-dong, the psycho's gone!
Are you sure this time?  Yes.
I actually saw him leave.
That guy is holding a human head.
He's holding a human head!
Check it out, man!
I tore it off a mannequin in the alley behind Macy's. Ha, ha.
There is no alley behind Macy's.
So I got it in the junior miss department. Big diff.
It'll make a hell of a conversation piece at our next cocktail party, huh?
"Our next cocktail party"?
Yeah, you know, we'll put chips in it. We'll make it a chip chick.
Eddie, do you remember yesterday?
Uh, yes, I think I vaguely recall it.
Ahem. Do you remember talking to me yesterday?
Uh, yes.
So, what happened?
We took a road trip to Las Vegas!
Oh, sweet Moses!
So on this road trip, uh, did you win any money?
Nah, I crapped out. But Mr. 21 here! He cleans up!
$300! He buys me these new shoes. Sweet, huh?
Nice.
Uh, see you upstairs. See you, pals!
Is anyone else starting to really like him?
May I help you?
Why doesn't my key work, and what's my stuff doing downstairs?
I'm sorry. Aah.
Have we met?
It's Eddie, you freak! Your roommate.
I'm sorry, I, uh...
...I already have a roommate.
Hello.
Um, he's lived here for years. I don't know what you're talking about.
No, no. He's, uh...
No, he moved out and I moved in.
Well, I think we'd remember something like that.
I know I would. Ha, ha.
That's, uh, a good point. Um...
Okay, wow. Huh.
I guess I got the wrong apartment.
Look, I'm...
I'm terribly sorry.  Hey, no problem.
See you.
Goodbye, you fruit-drying psychopath.
You want me to help you unpack?  Nah, I'm okay. Oh, and, uh...
Just so you know, I'm not moving back in because I have to.
I mean, I do have to, but...
It's just that that place, it wasn't really...
I mean, this is...
Welcome home, man.
A little foos?  Absolutely!
What happened to the foosball?
It's a cantaloupe.
Are we gonna bring this out every time Ross comes over?
He paid a lot of money for it.
I'm gonna hold him a different way.  All right.
If you hated it so much, why'd you buy it in the first place?
Well, I had a whole ceramic-zoo thing going over there.
But without the other ones, it looks tacky.
Is he housetrained or will he leave little bathroom tiles all over?
Stay.
Uh, stay!
Good fake dog.
Hey.
What you guys doing?  Monica's making us watch Old Yeller.
Why are you guys upset? It's Old Yeller. It's a happy movie.
What? What are you talking about?
Come on. Happy family gets a dog.
Frontier fun!
Pheebs, what about the end?
Oh, when Yeller saves the family from the wolf and everyone's happy?
That's not the end.
Yeah-huh. That's when my mother would shut off the TV and say, "The end."
What about when he has rabies?
He doesn't have rabies. He has babies.
That's what my mom said.
Uh, Phoebe, I don't think she'd want you to see what's about to happen.
Why? What's about to happen?
I've never seen this part.
Hey, Travis, what you doing with that gun?
Oh, no.
No, no, Travis, put down the gun.
No, no, he's your buddy. He's your Yeller.
No! The end! The end!
Okay, what kind of a sick doggy snuff film is this?
Friends S02E20: The One Where Old Yeller Dies
Have you guys eaten? Uh, Richard and I just finished, and we've got leftovers.
Chicken and potatoes.
What am I wearing?
Actually, nothing but rubber gloves.
One of these times, you'll really be naked and we won't come over.
I got a leg, three breasts and a wing.
How do you find clothes that fit?
Oh, hey, Monica? We got a question.
All right, yes, I see other women in the shower at the gym.
And no, I don't look.
No, not that one.
We're figuring out who to bring to the Knicks game.
Ross can't go, so it's between my friend Eric Prower, who has breath issues...
...and Dan, with the poking. "Did you see that play?"
"You want more beer? Is that Spike Lee?"
Ha, ha, okay.
Why don't you ask Richard?
Uh, Richard, if you had an extra ticket to the Knicks game...
...and you had to choose between a friend who smelled...
...and one who bruises you, who would you pick?
Wow.
Being a huge Knicks fan myself...
...I think you should take someone who's a huge Knicks fan.
Okay.
That's Eric.
Glad to be of help. Matches.
I meant, why don't you take Richard to the game?
CHANDLER & JOEY: Eh.
What?
I don't know.  Come on!
He keeps his fingers to himself, and he's always minty fresh.
Richard's really nice. Uh, we just don't know him really well.
Plus, he's old...
- er than some people.
But, uh, younger than some buildings.
So what, he's a little older. Big deal.
He's important to me.
If you ask him, he might take you in his Jag.
How do we say yes...
...and make it seem like it's not just to ride in the cool car?
Okay, this could be tough.
Okay, okay, okay. Monica?
We'll bring him, but only if he takes the Jaguar.
Ooh, you almost had it.
No, no, you're fine. You're fine.
Hello, ha, ha. Hey.
Hi, honey. Oh.
You are not gonna believe what happened!
We were playing on the floor, and he grabs the table...
...and he pulls himself up!
He pulled himself up!
Standing man!
I'm sorry you missed it, but I did tape it if you wanna see it.
Uh, we know. He already did it last week.
You can watch our tape if you want.
Ah, see, I don't believe this. I missed the first time of everything.
The first time he rolled over, the first time he crawled.
What else? Has he spoken? Is he driving?
Does he have a favorite liqueur?
He is getting closer on the talking thing.
He can't quite say "mama" yet, but once he said "Yemen."
See, I don't know. I'm so sick of missing stuff.
I want him for more than a day. I want him for a whole weekend.
Listen. I feel...
That would be great.
Really? I had a whole speech prepared.
Oh, shoot, that would've been fun.
Oh, look, did you just see that?
Did you see? He just waved! He just waved!
He's never waved before!
Yes, he has. Very good.
Hey.  Hey, Pheebs. What you got there?
Love Story, Brian's Song and Terms of Endearment.
Wow, all you need now is The Killing Fields...
...and some guacamole, and you got yourself a party!
I talked to my grandma about the Old Yeller incident...
...and she said my mom used to not show us the ends of sad movies...
...to shield us from the pain and sadness.
You know, before she killed herself.
Hey. Hey.
Where's Richard? Did you ditch him?
After we stole his lunch money and gave him a wedgie.
What's the matter with you? He's parking the car.
Did you guys have fun?  Your boyfriend is so cool.
He let us drive his Jaguar. Joey for 12 blocks. Me for 15.
Wow.
He must like you best.
Oh, what about when he tipped the guy who showed us to our seats?
You never even saw the money.
Hey, Chandler, thanks for showing us to our seats.
Ha, ha, you're welcome. Hey, Joey, thanks for parking the car.
No problem, ha, ha.
Hey, Chandler... I think they get it.
There's the man!
Hey.
Hey, you're getting better. Huh? Ha, ha.
I'm gonna keep this.
Okay.
He kept my dollar.
Your first weekend without Ben. What are you doing?
Ah, we're going to colonial Williamsburg.
A woman I went to college with is the first female blacksmith there.
They're a little behind the times in colonial Williamsburg.
Ha, ha. Well, look, I better go before Mommy starts weeping.
We love you.  Bye, Mommy.
Have a good time.
Okay, Ben.
Ross. Yeah?
Look.
Joey, do you know we can see you from here?
How come Richard looks cooler with one of these?
You may wanna light it and lose the spatula.
It's cute, you trying to be more like Richard.
Not like him, per se.
Just not unlike him.
It's the artist formerly known as Chandler.
I'm just trying something here, you know?
Why didn't you grow a mustache?
Oh, we flipped for it.
I got the cigar, he got the mustache.
If we both grew them, we'd look like dorks.
You really sidestepped that land mine.
I promised Richard we'd meet downstairs.
You're meeting Richard?
Ranger game.  Didn't he tell you?
He said he was going out with the guys. I didn't know that was you.
You hear that?
We're the guys!  We're the guys!
With that mustache, he reminds me of Aunt Sylvia.
Thank you!
Hi, we're visiting. Yay.
It's Ben and his dada.
Dada.
Can you say "dada"?  Aw.
I'm telling your mommies you said it, so you might as well.
No luck, huh?  No.
A while ago, I got a "seh" out of him...
...which I thought might turn into "seh-condary caregiver," but...
Would you, uh, hold him for a sec? I gotta take this off.
Oh, yeah, sure, okay. There we go.
What are you doing?
I'm holding Ben.
Yeah, well, he's a baby, not a bomb.
Okay.
Hold him like you'd hold a football.
This is how I would hold a football.
Here. Here. There we go.
Sorry, I'm not very good with babies. I haven't been around them.
I mean, you know, since I was one. Ha, ha.
It's all right. No big deal. Really?
You'll feel different when it's our baby.
What?  What?
You think about stuff like that?
Uh, yeah. I mean...
Actually, I kind of think that we'll have two babies.
Two babies?
You know, a boy and a girl.
Hopefully, the girl will come first, so Ben won't feel competitive.
Then what's gonna happen?
We won't wanna raise kids in the city, so we'll move to Scarsdale.
Scar... Uh-huh.
We'll be far enough from our parents so we don't have to see them...
...but close enough that they can babysit.
And yes, I know the taxes are a little higher than Nassau County...
...but the school system's great.
Wow! Ha, ha.
Wow, that's great! Great!
Okay, wow! You know what? Hmm?
I'm off my break now. So, uh...
Um, here. You take this.
And, um...
I'm gonna go pour these very nice people some coffee.
Okay.
Look at that. I don't have a pot.
I don't have a pot. Maybe I've got one at home.
Or in Scarsdale. Hey, is that a door?
Rach.
Hey. Hey, Pheebs. What's happening?
Oh, okay, murder, cancer, soccer teams eating each other in the Andes.
You watched the movies? Uh-huh.
What is happening to the world?
I mean... No, no, because E.T. Leaves...
...and Rocky loses. Charlotte dies.
Charlotte who?
With the web. The spider.
She dies. She has babies and dies.
It's like, "Welcome home from the hospital." Thud!
You wanna feel better?
Yeah.  Okay.
Here. Watch this.
It's a Wonderful Life. Yes, I've heard of this.
So you can't lose. It's there in the title.
Wonderfulness is baked right in.
I fell for that with Pride of the Yankees.
I thought I'd see a film about Yankee pride.
And boom! The guy gets Lou Gehrig's disease.
Uh, the guy was Lou Gehrig. Didn't you kind of see it coming?
Watch that. It'll restore all your faith in humanity.
Hey, big guy. Game time.
Hey! Be right there! There's a game?
I just got my Pik-Up Stiks back from the shop.
Bring your nerves of steel.
It's the basketball playoffs.
Um, I appreciate this, but you don't have to hang out with them for me.
They have each other.
Oh, no, honey. I mean, don't worry.
I like hanging out with them. They're different than my other friends.
They don't start sentences with "You know who just died shoveling snow?"
All right, that's great. Then just go.
Go Knicks!
Uh, it's the college playoffs. Oh.
Then, go Vassar! Uh, they're not in it.
Okay, then just go.  Okay.
Ugh, why does this bother me so much?
I'm not one of those people who wants to spend 24 hours a day together.
Sure.
He just doesn't have much free time. What do I do?
Does it matter? You'll just die or divorce or blow your pet's head off.
Ugh! Me too!
Rachel, I got a question. Richard made plans again with the guys...
Ross made plans for the century.
I'm gonna go read Cosmo. Maybe there's something helpful in it.
If not, I can learn how to do a bikini wax with leftover Christmas candles.
Okay.
What happened back there?
I don't know. You tell me.
One minute I'm holding Ben, then I've got two kids...
...l'm living in Scarsdale complaining about taxes!
Well, I'm sorry. I think about stuff.
You're at work, you're assembling bones, your mind wanders.
You've planned out the next 20 years. We've dated for six weeks!
You never think about our future?
I think about whose apartment we'll sleep at tomorrow...
...and where we'll have dinner next Saturday!
I do not think about our children's names!
You know what our children's names will be?
Ha, ha, no.
No, I mean, you know. I read a book, and there was a girl named Emily.
And I thought that might be good.
What was the book?
The Big Book of Children's Names.
Okay. Ross, Ross.
Okay, listen.
What we have is amazing.
But I do not want everything decided for me!
I spent my whole life like that.
It's what I had with Barry. That's a reason I left.
I like not knowing right now.
Sorry if that scares you, but if you wanna be with me, deal with that!
Okay, fine! Thank you!
We're not done! I didn't know that.
You're with a guy who won't stop planning his future with you.
He knows we'll end up together.
If that scares you, tough! You'll have to deal with that.
I will! Good, because I love you!
Oh, yeah? I love you too!
That's the first time we've said that!  Yes.
I'm gonna kiss you!  You better!
Hey. Hey.
Oh, thanks for the great movie tip.
Did you like it?  Oh, yeah.
I don't know if I was happier when George Bailey destroyed the business...
...or, um, Donna Reed cried or when the pharmacist made his ear bleed.
I'll give you the ear thing, but wasn't the ending wonderful?
I didn't watch it. I was too depressed.
It kept getting worse! It should've been called:
"It's a Sucky Life, And Just When You Think It Can't Suck Anymore, It Does!"
Kick, save! And...
...denied!
He gets it back. Pass to the middle, lines it up and bam!
Yes!
Could that shot be any prettier?
Man, you are incredible.
We had a table in college.
Oh, really? I didn't know they had foosball in the 1800s.
Nice mustache. At puberty, that thing will really kick in.
Not to sound too Florence Henderson, but dinner's on the table.
One more point.
Score!
Now can we go?  Uh...
That's why we don't let her play.
Is everything all right?  Mm-hm.
Uh-oh.
Oh, hey, don't be mad at him. It's our fault.
I'm sorry we've been hogging his time.
He's just really great to hang out with.
Well... No, seriously.
We just talked about this. He is so much cooler than our dads.
Our dads are okay and all, but Richard is just...
Ow, ow, ow. What are you kicking me for?
Huh? I'm trying to talk here.
Uh, you guys see me as a dad?
Oh, yeah.  No!
No.
You're just clearly not familiar with our young persons' vernacular.
When we say "dad," we mean "buddy."
We mean "pal." Uh-huh, yeah.
No, seriously. Joey's my dad.
Monica's my dad.
I've even got some dads down at work.
That's fine.
Well, your other dad and I are gonna go have a romantic evening.
I'll just see you kids around.
Nighty-night.
You're not a dad! You're not a dad!
I can't believe you got us into trouble.
So are you okay?
Yeah.
Just...
...I feel like I'm about a hundred.
I thought I was just one of the guys.
Come here.
I'll make you feel like one of the guys.
Mm.
For a really cool guy, you suck at foosball.
I was killing them.
Yeah, well they suck too. Ha, ha.
Hmm.
You take the poopy diaper and put it in the poopy diaper pail.
Calling it a "poopy diaper" doesn't make this process any cuter.
Hello. It's us.
Come on up.
I'll get his stuff together.
Okay, we can do this now, can't we, Ben?
Yes, we can.
There! I did it!
Ha, ha, I did it!
Ooh, look at that!
Oh, it stays on and everything.
Hi.Hi.
I'm sorry. What did you just say? Did you just say "hi"?
Oh, my God! Ross? Ben just said hi!
What? Ben just said hi!
What, the word "hi"?
No, my Uncle Hi.
Great! And I missed that too. I miss everything!
Oh, I'm sorry. I guess I just bring it out in him.
Where is he? We missed you.
We missed you so much! Come here, Ben, ha, ha.
Guess what? Ben just said his first word.
What did he say?
Something about hi.
That's so exciting!  Mommy's so proud of you!
Hi. Hi?
You know, actually, it's more like, hi!
- Hi? - Hi.
Hi.  Hi.
This could go on for a while.
You're right. We've got a cab waiting.
Well, this was fun.
We should do it again sometime, Ben. What do you say?
Okay.
All right, so I've got him?  Tuesday.
Bye, you guys.
Take care. Bye, Ben.
Bye.
Did he just say "bye"?
He said bye!
You said... He said bye to me!
Yes, he did! Oh.
Suddenly I'm seeing him go off to college!
We've gotta go. We've got that cab downstairs.
See you later.
Bye. Bye.
Oh! Ha, ha.
Bye. Bye.
Bye.
Oh.
Wow. Look at this nice deep hole I dug. Hey, Bert...
...isn't this a nice hole here?
Okay, ahem.
Ben, this is the part where Ernie buries Bert in the sand and can't find him.
Now, I've looked ahead on the tape, and he does find him again.
But before that happens, there's some rough going for a while.
But I think we can handle it.
And there's just the alphabet, but we know that ends well, so...
Here we go.
Bert? Bert?
Bert?
What happened to my friend Bert? He was here just a moment ago.
Oh, no! My old friend Bert is lost.
Mm. I'm so glad you're here.
Stocks and bonds are moving higher...
Why are we watching the Business Channel?
Because the other day I saw there was a stock with my initials, MEG, on it.
Sometimes it takes two or three hours before it comes up again.
But when it does, it's exciting.
Hmm, okay, honey, you really need a job.
Dad says he knows someone you can call for an interview.
Right there! That's the third sign today. Right there.
On behalf of everyone, I'd just like to say, "Huh?"
No, you just said "dad." And everywhere I go today...
...I keep getting signs telling me to go see my father.
Like when I was walking over here and I passed a buffet.
Which is my father's last name.
Ah.
And they were serving franks...
...which is his first name, minus the "s" at the end.
Yes. All right.
And there was a rotisserie with a spinning chicken.
His Indian name?
No. Because I chickened out the last time...
...when I tried to meet him. So coincidences? I don't think so.
Very freaky.  Eerie.
Who wants the last hamburger?
That's it. Now I have to go see him, ha, ha.
Why?
Hamburger? McDonald's?
Old McDonald had a farm. My dad is a pharmacist.
Ah.
Friends S02E21: The One With the Two Bullies
Man, I am so beat.
Oh, yeah.
You wanna forget racquetball and hang out?
Yeah, all right.
Hey, you're in our seats.  Oh, sorry, we didn't know.
Hey, we were sitting there.
Okay. There is one more way to say it.
Who knows it? Ha, ha. Ha, ha.
Is that supposed to be funny? - Actually, I was going for colorful.
What's with this guy?  What's with you?
Uh, nothing. Nothing's with him.
Enjoy your coffee.
What just happened?
I just took your hat.
See, I can be funny too.
My joke is that I took your hat.
That is funny.
Can I have it back?
No.
No?  No.
Okay. Okay.
You know what? I think you're very funny.
Kudos on that hat joke. Ha, ha.
But come on, guys, just give him back the hat.
Why should we?
Because it's a special hat.
He bought it because he was feeling down one day.
So he got the hat...
...to cheer himself up, you know?
Now, Chandler...  Stop talking. Stop talking now.
Let me get this straight. You're stealing my hat?
You got a problem?
I just want to make sure we're on the same page.
How'd the interview go?
It bit.
It was a '50s theme restaurant.
I'd have to cook in a costume and dance on the counter.
I was a sous-chef at Café des Artistes.
How can I take a job where I have to make Laverne-and-Curly Fries?
Don't do it.  How can I not do it?
I have $127 in the bank.
Monica, relax. Go get a beer.
I don't want a beer.
Who said it was for you?
Hi.
What's the matter?
Some mean guys at the coffeehouse took my hat.
No.  You're kidding.
It was ridiculous. These guys were bullies.
Actual bullies.
We're grownups. This kind of stuff isn't supposed to happen anymore.
Oh, hi.  Hi.
Oh...
Oh, no, wait a minute. I have no one.
Let's go down there and get your hat back.
Forget it. It's probably stripped and sold for parts by now.
Hey. I went up!  What?
My stock, MEG, it went up two points.
Do you realize that if I'd invested my $127 in myself yesterday...
...that I'd, like, have a lot more than that today.
You know what? I'm gonna do it.
Do what? - Put all my money in me.
You don't know a thing about the stock market.
What's to know? Buy, sell. High, low. Bears, bulls.
Yes, Manhattan.
Telephone number to the stock...
...selling store.
See? Didn't I tell you these pillows would be a good idea?
Oh, God.
Here we go.
For the first time in my life, I'm gonna say, "Hi, birth father!"
We love you. We're here for you. - Good luck.
Thanks.
Hey, Rach, you, uh, want some sandwich?
Oh, what is in that?
Olive loaf and ham spread. No mayo.
No, because mayo, that would make it gross.
Hey, hey... No, oh, oh, oh.
Run, Phoebe, run.  No, no, doggy, please!
I do so want to love all animals. Please, no. Back off!
You got a bone? - Are you kidding?
Look, kibbles! Bits, oh!
Get the hell off my leg, you yippity piece of crap!
Ooh.
Okay. All right. We have a problem.
Why don't you take his trampoline?
Okay, here, I know what we can do.
Hey. Hey. Hey, no!
Okay, doggy, get the sandwich! Aah!
Go get the sandwich! Good doggy. Get the sandwich!
The dog will lick himself but he will not touch your sandwich.
What does that tell you?
Lf he's not gonna eat it, I will.  Are you crazy?
Pheebs, he's just a little dog. Aah!
Hey.  What?
Do you have to be a Century 21 real-estate agent...
...to get to wear those cool jackets?
Do you say this stuff to girls?
Hey, isn't that the guy who used to wear your hat?
And look where they're sitting.
You're joking, right? You guys just walked through the door.
Maybe we didn't make it clear enough.  Yeah.
This couch belongs to us.
I'll tell you what, you call the couch...
...and then we'll call the couch...
...and we'll see who it comes to.
You know what I keep wondering? Why you two are still sitting here.
All right, that's it.
I have had enough of this, all right?
Gunther.
These guys are trying to take our seat.
Fellas, these guys were here first.
Oh, sorry, didn't realize.  Ahem.
There you go.
Thank you, Gunther.
We didn't want to have to go and do that.
He told on us?
You told on us?
Well, pal, you didn't give me much of a choice.
Don't play with his thing.  I know.
All right.
Let's take this outside.
"Let's take this outside"?
Who talks like that?
The guy who's about to kick your ass talks like that.
You had to ask. Yeah.
Okay, okay, look. See...
...the thing is, we're not gonna fight you guys.
Here's the deal.
You won't have to, so long as you never ever show your faces here again.
I think you played the Gunther card too soon.
Hey, Pheebs, I think you're good to go.
Yeah, I don't know.
What's the matter?
I just think that this was a really bad sign.
Like the beast at the threshold.
It's just I have no family left, except for my grandmother.
But let's face it, she's not gonna be around forever.
Despite what she says.
And I have a sister who I've barely spoken to since we shared a womb.
I don't know. This is my real father...
...and I want things to be, like, just right.
I completely understand.
Yeah, whatever you need.
Hey, you want to go home?
Okay, thanks. Sorry again.
What was that?
Uh, I'm guessing the threshold's clear now.
I want to buy five shares of SGJ. Now.
Come on, time is money, my friend!
Thank you! Whoo!
"Time is money, my friend"?
You missed "Takes money to make money"...
...and "Don't make me come down there and kick your Wall Street butt."
I made $17 before breakfast. What have you done?
I had breakfast here, so technically I saved $3.50.
How did you make $17?
Well, my financially challenged friends...
...I split my money and I bought some shares of CHP and ZXY.
How come those?
Well, CHP because I used to have a crush on Erik Estrada.
And ZXY because I think it sounds "zexy."
Ahem, what happened to MEG?
MEG was good for me, but I dumped her.
My motto is, "Get out before they go down."
That is so not my motto.
Hey.Hey, Pheebs.
Oh, hey, how's the dog? Yeah.
Okay. I talked to the vet. People are so nice upstate.
He said the little fella's gonna be okay, and I can get him tomorrow.
Good. Oh, thank God.
But he did have to have a bunch of stitches.
And he said that only once in a blue moon does a dog's ear grow back.
So still hoping.
Now are you gonna call your dad to let him know that his dog is okay?
I don't want to meet my father over the phone.
What will I say, "Hi, I'm the daughter you abandoned.
Oh, by the way, I broke your dog."
Hey, Pheebs, if you want, I'll do it.
Okay.
Listen, just don't say anything about me, okay?
Don't...
...be too long with the phone.
She'll be a much better friend once the market closes.
It's a woman.
So talk to her.
Uh, hello, Mrs. Buffay.
I know where your dog is.
I want you to know he'll be returned to you almost as good as new...
...within 24 hours.
Uh, goodbye.
Why the voice?  Hard to say.
Your cappuccino, sir.
Thank you.
This is better than the coffeehouse.  Absolutely.
How come it's not mixing with the water?
The package says to keep it moving.
Stir and drink, never let it settle.
This is ridiculous.
After I get back from my niece's christening...
...l'll go to the coffeehouse with you and we'll have a cup of coffee.
No problem. Joey's there, hmm?
Okay. No.
No? - No.
I don't want to have to have Joey with me every time I want decent coffee.
And I don't want to drink cappuccino with a "k."
I say you and I go and stand up to those guys.
All right, hang on a second there, Custer.
Ross, have you ever been beaten up before?
Yeah, sure.
By someone besides Monica? No.
So what?
So we get beaten up. Maybe that's something a man has to go through.
Like a rite of passage or something.
Couldn't we just lose our virginities again?
Because I think actually mine's growing back.
I need $100.  What?
Hi. Welcome home.
I need $100.  For what?
To get back in the game.  When did you get out?
I lost it all, I lost it.  Oh, no.
I've come to terms with it, you have to too.
Okay.
Look, uh, Mon, I'm really sorry.
Where are we on the $100?
I don't have it.
But I need it!
Otherwise, I'll have to take that diner job.
You know, with the dancing and the costumes.
I don't want to have to wear flame-retardant boobs.
Nobody does, honey.
Hi.
Noodle!
Oh, my God. What the hell happened to my dog?
It was an accident.
And the woman who did this would never hurt a dog on purpose.
She's a vegetarian.
Are these stitches?
Yeah, eight of them. That's 56 to him, ha, ha.
If it's raining, you can't let him look up too long...
...because that cone will fill up fast.
Well, uh, thanks for bringing back what's left of him.
Is Frank home? - How do you know Frank?
Just from a long time ago. Is he here?
Yeah. Frank.
Yeah.
What?
Oh, okay, um, I mean Frank Senior.
He went out for groceries.
Will he be back soon?
He left four years ago. We're expecting him back any minute.
I'm gonna go.
I'm sorry about the dog. Everything.
I'm sorry.
Hey, lady!
Hey, wait up!
How do you know my dad?  Um, well, I don't really.
Just genetically.
He's kind of my dad too.
Heavy.
Yeah.
So, um, did he ever talk about me? Phoebe?
No, but he didn't really talk about anything.
Oh.
Except stilts.
Stilts? - Yeah, he loved stilts.
One time, I was upstairs stealing cigarettes out of my mom's purse...
...and, uh, all of a sudden I look over...
...and there's Dad's head, bobbing past the window.
He just had this big smile on his face and he was waving...
...because he was happiest when he was on his stilts.
Wow. Yeah.
I don't know what to do with that.
Me neither, ha, ha. Ha, ha.
So are you, like, my big sister? - Yeah.
This is huge. You can buy me beer, ha, ha.
I'm not gonna. - Oh.
But you know what's cool? If you had a friend named Pete, I could say:
"I know Pete. He's friends with my brother."
I got a friend named Mark.  That'll work too.
Cool. All right.
So maybe, you know, I could give you a call sometime.
We could talk or something.
Yeah, that'd be okay.  All right.
I'm in the book.
Okay, yeah. Okay, all right.
So, um, stilts, huh?
If you want, I can show you where he hit his head on the rain gutter.
Okay.
We did it. We're here. We are standing our ground.
How long does coffee take?  Would you come on? Come on!
Thank you.
There we go.  I think we proved our point.
You burn your mouth?  Cannot feel my tongue.
Bullies! Big bullies!
Oh, look who's here. It's the weenies.
Did we not make ourselves clear the other day?
That's why we're here.
Yes, we're standing our ground.
Apparently.
Let's do this already.Whoa, whoa.
You got a weapon?
A nice watch. I don't want to break it on your ribs.
All right, let's do this.
Question: If I don't care about my watch, can I use it as a weapon?
What do you mean?  It's sharp, it's metal.
I think I can do some serious damage with it.
No, you can't use your watch.
Okay.
Or your keys.  Okay.
Here's what we'll do.
We'll put all keys and watches in the hat over there.
All right? All right.
All right, come on, man. Let's do it!
Before I forget, are we hitting faces?
Of course. Why wouldn't you hit faces?
I have to work on Monday. I have a big presentation.
Actually, I gotta show this apartment tomorrow...
...and, uh, this no-faces thing might not be a bad idea.
Okay, nothing from the neck up.
All right.
Or the waist down.
Dana's ovulating.  Oh, really? You guys trying again?
Yeah.
Let me get this straight. We're talking about the middle?
Come on! - Hey, hey, whoa!
You want a piece of this? I'm standing here!
Huh! Hey, hey.
Those guys are taking our stuff!
Hey, hey!
God, that was amazing. That was incredible.
You guys kicked butt! - Us? What about you guys?
You really, bing, gave it to old Mr. Clean back there.
He was a big guy.  Yeah, he was, wasn't he?
I wouldn't know, having missed everything.
Oh, don't do that to yourself.
Any one of us could have tripped over that little girl's jump rope.
So listen, guys, are we, uh?
Are we okay here?
We're okay. Ha, ha, all right.
Okay, so can I have my hat back?
No.
Huh.
Oh, my God. Look at her.
Hi, Monica!
Ha-ha-ha, how's it going?
Hey, nice boobs.
Guys, guys. Check this out.
Excellent.
So I'll get candles and my mom's lace tablecloth.
Since it's Rachel's birthday and we want it to be special...
...I thought I'd poach a salmon. GROUP: Oh.
What?
Question: Why do we always have to have parties where you poach things?
You wanna be in charge of the food committee?
Question two: Why do we always have parties with committees?
Yeah, yeah. Why can't we just get some pizzas...
...and gets some beers and have fun? - Yeah.
Yeah, I agree. You know, I think fancy parties are only fun...
...if you're fancy on the inside, and I'm just not sure we are.
All right. You guys don't want it to be special?
Fine. You can throw any kind of party you want.
Joey, they're not real. Huh? Huh.
I start miles beneath the surface of these things, okay? They're fake.
See? Honk, honk.
Wow, it's like porno for clowns.
Friends S02E22: The One With the Two Parties
I talked to Rachel's sisters. Neither of them can come.
Okay, so I still have to invite Dylan and Emma and Shannon Cooper.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Uh, no Shannon Cooper.
Why not her?
Because she, uh... She steals stuff.
Or maybe she doesn't steal stuff...
...and Joey slept with her and never called her back.
Joey, that is horrible. Hey, I liked her.
All right? Maybe too much. I don't know.
I guess I just got scared.
I'm sorry. I didn't know.
Heh. I didn't think anyone would buy that. Okay.
Hi, honey. How did it go? Ugh. It was the graduation from hell.
You know, my cousin went to hell on a football scholarship.
You know, I mean, this is supposed to be a joyous occasion.
My sister's graduating from college. Nobody thought she would.
It's a true testament to what a girl from Long Island would do for a Celica.
So, what happened?  My parents happened.
All they had to do was sit in the same stadium, smile proudly...
...and not talk about the divorce. But no.
They got into a huge fight in the middle of the commencement address.
Bishop Tutu actually had to stop and shush them.
Ugh. But you know what? You know what the good news is?
I get to serve coffee for the next eight hours.
Okay, so I guess we don't invite her parents.
Well, how about just her mom? Why her mom?
Because I already invited her.
Ooh, did you ask Stacy Roth?
Uh, can't invite her.
She also steals.
Okay, here are the candles. Where's the birthday cake?
Okay, we're not having birthday cake. We're having birthday flan.
Excuse me?
It's a traditional Mexican custard dessert.
Whoa, that's nice.
Happy birthday, Rachel. Here's some goo.
MONICA: Dr. Green.
Oh, my God. It's Rachel's dad.
What are you doing here?
What, the father can't drop by to see the daughter on her birthday?
No, no, the father can.
But, um, since I am the roommate, I can tell you that she's not here.
And I'll pass along the message. Okay? So bye-bye.
Oh. You're having a party.
No, no, not a party.
Just a surprise gathering of some people Rachel knows.
Uh, this is Phoebe and Chandler and Joey. I'll never remember all of that.
So, uh, what's the deal?
Rachel comes home, people pop out and yell stuff? Is that it?
This isn't your first surprise party, is it, sir?
Hi, Monica.
The Chinese menu guy. Forgot the menus.
So basically, just a Chinese guy.
Hey, Dr. Green, come with me. We'll put your jacket on Rachel's bed.
All right. That sounds like a two-person job.
Well, my goodness. What was that?
Sandra, I am so sorry. I thought you were Rachel.
And we weren't ready for you yet.
You thought I was Rachel? Yes, because, uh, you look so young.
And because you're both, you know, white women.
Oh, I missed you kids.
Well, should I put my coat in the bedroom?
No.
No, I'll take that for you. Oh, well, thank you.
Okay.  Such a gentleman. Thank you.
Oh.
Oh, it all looks so nice. So festive. All the balloons.
Oh, the funniest thing happened to me on the way here.
I was driving... That's great. Ha-ha-ha.
I can't wait to hear the rest, but I have to go to the bathroom.
So... Hey, come with me.
What?  Yeah, yeah. It will be like we're gal pals.
You know, like at a restaurant. Oh, it'll be fun. Come on.
Ha, ha. Come on.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Okay, think. Think.
What would Jack and Chrissy do?
Okay, now that your coat is safely in the bed...
Okay. We can come back out in the living room. Ha, ha.
So, Joey and Chandler, I think it's time that you take Dr. Green over to your place.
Uh, yes, absolutely.
Um, why, again?
Because that's where the party is, you goon.
See, this is just the staging area.
Right, it's the staging area. This is the staging area.
This is clearly in the wrong apartment.
All right, you guys are off to party number one.
And you...
You are off to party number two.
All right, fellas, let's keep it moving, let's keep it moving.
Chandler, could you at least send some women to my party.
Okay, that's Ross. All right.
Okay, they're coming. Shh!
Thank you for such a wonderful dinner.
Thanks for being born.
Oh, thank you for my beautiful earrings. They're perfect.
Aw. I love you.
Oh. Now, you can exchange them if you want, okay?
Hmm. Now I love you even more.
Surprise!
Oh, my gosh. Wow.
Oh, Monica. Oh, my God. Mom.
This is so great.
SANDRA: Happy birthday, sweetie.
Wow. You. I had no idea.
Really? No, I knew.
All right.
Everybody, there's food and drinks on the table.
Go across the hall. What?
Right now, Joey and Chandler's. Go.
Why?  Just go.
Weird. Surprise!
Happy birthday, sweet pea.
Daddy! Ha, ha.
Both of them are here? Both of them? Both of them are here?
Well, we could count again?
I can't believe this is happening.  You know what? This is ridiculous.
Okay, this is your birthday, this is your party.
I say we just put them all together. If they can't deal with it, who cares?
I do.  That's who.
Look, are you gonna be okay?
Well, I have to be. I don't really have a choice.
I mean, I can look at the bright side.
I get two birthday parties and two birthday cakes.
Well, actually just one birthday flan.
What?  It's a traditional Mexican custard dessert.
Look, talk to Monica. She's on the food committee.
Joe, Joe, hey, some girl just walked up to me and said, "I want you, Dennis"...
...and stuck her tongue down my throat.
I love this party.
Quick volleyball question.  Volleyball.
Yeah, we set up a court in your room.
Uh, you didn't like that gray lamp, did you?
Joey, a woman just stuck her tongue down my throat.
I'm not even listening to you.
Dennis.  Okay, that's me.
Listen, ahem, honey, can you keep Dad occupied?
I'm gonna go talk to Mom for a while.
Okay, do you have any ideas for any openers?
Uh, let's just stay clear of "I'm the guy that's doing your daughter"...
...and you should be okay.
Okay, people, I want you to take a piece of paper...
Here you go. And write down your most embarrassing memory.
And I do ask that when you're not using the markers...
...you put the caps back on them...
...because they will dry out.
Hi, Dr. Green.
So how's everything in the, uh...
...vascular surgery game?
It's not a game, Ross. A woman died on my table today.
I'm sorry.
See, that's the good thing about my job.
All the dinosaurs on my table are already dead.
Listen, you guys, um, I don't mean to be a pain about this...
...but, um, I've noticed that some of you are just placing them on.
You want to push the caps...
...until you hear them click.
Gunther. Where you going?
I, uh, was sort of thinking about maybe...
No. No, you can't go. No, this is fun.
Come on, come on, we're just getting started. Here's your marker.
Listen, if you want to go, just go.
No. She'll yell at me again.
All right, ahem, I can get you out.
What?
Shh.
In a minute, I'm gonna create a diversion.
When I do, walk quickly to the door and don't look back.
I think I need a drink.  Oh, I'll get it for you.
What do you want?  Scotch.
All right, I'll be back in 10 seconds with your Scotch on the rocks in a glass.
Neat.
Cool.
Neat, as in no rocks.
Heh. I know.
Oh, hello, Ross. Now, where have you been?
Hi. Uh, I have been in the bathroom.
Ahem. Stay clear of the salmon mousse.
Oh. Scotch neat.
You know, that's Rachel's father's drink.
Oh. Huh.
Mine too. Isn't that neat?
Scotch neat.
Would you excuse me?
Hey. Hey.
Where are you sneaking off to, mister? Heh.
I'm getting my cigarettes out of my jacket.
No. No. What do you mean "no"?
No, um, see, because that's the staging area.
You go in there, it'll ruin the whole illusion of the party.
Yeah, I think, you take your Scotch back in there...
...and I will get your cigarettes for you, sir.
And get my glasses too.  All righty-roo.
What a great moment to say that for the first time.
Okay, the first person's most embarrassing memory is:
"Monica, your party sucks."
All right. Very funny.
Oh, no. Ooh. Did someone forget to use a coaster?
What?
I don't see anything.
Great, I'm seeing water rings again.
Ross, whose glasses are those?
Mine.
You wear bifocals?
Mm-hm.
I have a condition apparently...
...that I require...
...two different sets of focals.
Do you know my husband has glasses just like that?
Oh. Well, those are very popular frames.
Neil Sedaka wears them.
I hear you can get people out of here.
Rachel?  Yeah?
You didn't tell me your boyfriend smokes.
Yeah, like a chimney.
Big smoker.
Big, big smoker.
In fact, I'm gonna go out into the hallway and fire up this bad boy.
Are you wearing my glasses?
Yes.
I was just warming up the earpieces for you.
Thank you.
Is that one of my cigarettes?
Yeah.
Yes, it is. I was just moistening the tip.
Okay, okay. She's taking the trash out, so I can get you out of here.
But it has to be now. She'll be back any minute.
What about my friend Victor?
No, only the three of you. Any more than that and she'll get suspicious.
All right. Let me just get my coat. There isn't time.
Just leave everything.
They'll take care of you next door.
Is it true they have beer?
Everything you've heard is true.
Could you guys please try and keep it down?
We're trying to start a Boggle tournament.
You. And you.
You're supposed to be at my party. And Gunther.
What are you doing here?
Um...
Hey, welcome to the fo...
Phoebe?
All right, I'm sorry. But these people needed me.
You know, they work hard all week. It's Saturday night.
They deserve to have a little fun. Go.
You know, my party is fun.
I mean, maybe it's a little quieter, less obvious sort of fun.
But, you know, if people would just give it a chance, it's...
You want me to see a therapist?  Sweetheart, you obviously have a problem.
You've chosen a boyfriend exactly like your father.
Okay, Mom, you know what? Fine. I'll make an appointment.
Okay? But you know what? Right now, I gotta go. I gotta go do a thing.
Did you know your mother spent $1200 on bonsai trees?
I felt like Gulliver around that place.
Daddy, Daddy, I really want to hear more about this...
...I really do, but I just have to do, uh, some stuff.
You work and you work and you work at a marriage...
...but all he cares about is his stupid boat.
You work and you work and you work on a boat.
He always ridiculed my pottery classes.
And you sand it and you varnish it.
But when all is said and done, he still drinks out of the mugs.
One night of her yoga and her Bridges of Madison County...
Scotch, cigarettes... Bonsais, the Chihuahua...
SANDRA: I've only been in therapy three weeks now but...
GREEN: What the hell does she want with half a boat?
Okay, okay, okay, you can be shirts and I'll be skins.
I'll be skins.
Hey.
How you holding up there, tiger?
Oh. Sorry. When my parents were getting divorced, I got a lot of "tigers."
Ahem. I got a lot of "champs," "chiefs," "sports."
Ahem. I even got a "governor."
This is it, isn't it? I mean, this is what my life is gonna be like.
My mom there, my dad there.
Thanksgiving, Christmas.
She gets the house, he's in some condo my sister's gonna decorate with wicker.
Chandler, how did you get through this?
Well, I relied on a carefully regimented program...
...of denial...
...and wetting the bed.
You know, I just... It's so weird.
I mean, I was in there just listening to them bitch about each other.
All I kept thinking about was the Fourth of July.
Because it reminded you of the way...
...our forefathers used to bitch at each other?
It's just this thing.
Every year we would go out on my dad's boat and watch the fireworks.
Mom always hated it because the ocean air made her hair all big.
My sister Jill would be throwing up over the side...
...and my dad would be upset because nobody was helping.
And then when we did help, he would scream at us for doing it wrong.
But then when the fireworks started, everybody just shut up.
You know, and it'd get really cold.
And we'd all just sort of smoosh under this one blanket.
It never occurred to anybody to bring another one.
And now it's...
Yeah, I know.
Thanks for coming. I hope you had fun.
All right, Monica, dear, I'm gonna hit the road.
Now, I've left my 10 verbs on the table.
Yes, and you be sure and send me that finished poem.
Okay, will do. So glad you came. All right, dear.
I think I saw Rachel out in the hall.  Okay, let me go check.
Oh, all right.
Your mom wants to say goodbye.  Oh, okay.
Happy birthday, sweetie.
Okay.
Uh, you drive safe.
Okay. What are you doing?
I'm getting ready for the water skiing.
Okay, big hug. One more. Come on.
How are you?
Dr. Green. Where are you going? To get my coat.
No, no, no. We'll get that for you.
All right, all right. I can get my own coat.
Sorry, we're on a major flan high.
Oh, no. No, you're not supposed to be here.
This is the staging area. It's all wrong. You should leave.
Ha, ha. You know, just get out.
Or perhaps you'd like a crème de menthe.
I have to be heading toward my chateau. Thank you.
All right, well, then I guess we're going back into the hallway again.
Thanks for coming, Mrs. Green.
Okay.
You take care.
Oh, you kids.
Well.
This is the best party I've been to in years.
Thank you.
Okay, everybody, it's time for flan.
Yep. Get ready for the gelatinous fun.
Kind of looks like that stuff you get when you get a bad infection.
Okay, that's enough.
Okay, Rachel, make a special flan wish.
Okay, I've got one.
Heads up.
Wow. Those things almost never come true.
Okay, Chandler, Mon, there's only one banana-nut muffin left.
I ordered mine first.
Yeah, but I'm so much faster.
Give it to me.
No.
Give it to me.
Okay, you can have it.
There you go. Enjoy your coffee.
That was there when I got here.
Hey, you guys, you will never guess who's coming to New York.
Quick, Phoebe, tell us before he swallows.
Ryan, that guy I went out with who's in the Navy.
You went out with a guy in the Navy?
Yeah, I met him while playing guitar in the park.
Ryan threw in saltwater taffy because he didn't have change.
Hey, is that when you wrote "Saltwater Taffy Man"?
No. Heh.
No, he's my submarine guy. He resurfaces, like, every couple years...
...and we have the most amazing three days together.
Only this time, he's coming for two weeks. Two whole weeks, which means "yay."
So wait, this guy goes down for, like, two years at a time?
That'll teach you to lick my muffin.
Hi.
Oh, no. What happened?
I just spoke to Carol. Ben's got chicken pox.
Oh, no. You're kidding.
Yeah, so if you haven't had it, chances are you're gonna get it.
Well, I've had it. Yeah, I've had it.
Had it.  Had it.
I've never had it. I feel so left out. Oh, look.
Friends S02E23: The One With the Chicken Pox
Honey, you made the bed again.
I told you, you don't have to do that. This isn't camp.
Oh. Then I guess the panty raid last night was totally uncalled for.
Okay, I am going to take a shower.
And today I will be singing Jim Croce's "Leroy Brown."
Monica?
Hey, Mon, I have a question.
Is Leroy the baddest man in the whole damn town...
...or the fattest man in the whole damn town?
The baddest. Otherwise, the song would be "Fat, Fat Leroy Brown."
What are you doing?
I'm just waiting for you, sweetie.
Are you remaking the bed?
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. You know what? The way you did it, it was just fine.
Then you're redoing it because?
If I tell you, you'll think I'm crazy.
You're pretty much running that risk either way.
Okay. You see...
...the duvet tag shouldn't be at the top left corner...
...it should be at the bottom right corner.
- Uh-huh. Well, that's not so crazy. - I'm just easing you in.
Ha. All right.
All right, you see these little flower blossoms?
They should be facing up, not down...
...because, well, the head of the bed is where the sun would be.
You don't love me anymore, do you?
Actually, if it's possible, I love you more.
Really?
Wow. Well, then, come on.
I wanna show you how to fold the toilet paper into a point.
Joey, if you need something to hold you over...
...I can get you a job right here as an entry-level processor.
Don't you need experience for a job like that?
It's not that hard to learn.
And as for people realizing you don't know what you're doing, hey, you're an actor.
Act like a processor, people will think you're a processor.
Hey, Chandler. Here's this morning's projections.
Hey, thanks. Scott Alexander, Joey Tribbiani.
Hey  Hey.
Joey is a, uh, fellow processor.
No kidding?
Oh, yeah.
I process. People want the processing, I'm the one they call.
Where do you work? Uh, well, right now I'm in between things.
You know how it is. One day you're processing, the next day...
...you're not so much processing anymore.
I was telling Joey about the opening in Fleischman's group.
Fleischman's group.
Whatever you do, don't touch his sandwiches.
Are all you processors dorks?
Ugh. This lipstick looks just great on you.
You look fabulous, honey. You really do.
Yeah, are you sure? Really?
See, you look beautiful. For God sakes, dim the lights.
I'm hideous.
It's gonna be okay.
Ryan's been underwater.
He's just gonna be so glad that you don't have barnacles on your butt.
Come in.
Hey, baby, I'm back...
Hey, Ryan. What's up?
What's going on?
PHOEBE: No, no. You have to stay back. I have the pox.
Chicken or small?
Chicken, which is so ironic considering I'm a vegetarian.
Why aren't you at home in bed?  My grandmother's never had chicken pox.
Please, please, tell me you have...
...because oh, my God, I forgot how cute you are.
I'm sorry, I never had them. Oh, oh!
If I had one wish, it'd be to build a time machine, go back to when I was 7...
...when Jimmy Hauser had chicken pox...
...I would grab that kid and rub him all over my face.
PHOEBE: Yeah, or, you know, you could just wish that I didn't have them now.
Can I please see your face?
No. You don't wanna see a face covered with pox.
Your face could be covered with lox, I wouldn't care.
PHOEBE: And you hate fish. Oh.
So sweet. All right.
Okay, all right. You can see.
This, ahem, is me.
Sorry.
I am scary.
Sorry, the lightning...
Lightning was an unfortunate coincidence.
You look lovely. Lovely.
I hate this.
I tell you, I had the most amazing two weeks planned for us.
And almost everything I had in mind, we had to be a lot closer than this.
Phoebe, I've spent the last eight months in a steel tube with men...
...thinking about this moment.
I am not gonna let a bunch...
...of itchy spots stand between us.
Okay. This is the most romantic disease I've ever had.
Hey. Hey. How's the first day going?
Pretty good. It's like you said.
It's mostly just putting numbers from one column into another column.
Well, there you go.
Hey, and everybody's so nice.
I just had a good talk with that lady with the red hair, Jeannie.
Jeannie? The head of East Coast Operations, Jeannie?
Yeah. Turns out our kids go to the same school.
Yeah. Small world, huh? Ha, ha.
Weird world.
Your kids?  I figure my character has kids.
You know, there isn't a part of that sentence that I don't need explained.
Well, see, when you're acting, you need to think about stuff like that.
My character, Joseph the processing guy...
...has two little girls, Ashley and Brittany.
Ashley copies everything Brittany does.
Oh. Well, invisible kids can be that way sometimes.
Yeah, yeah. You know, Joseph and his wife, Karen, are thinking of having a third kid.
You know what?
Just did.
Really, wow. That's some pretty powerful imaginary sperm you must have there.
You know what makes the itching even worse?
That you don't stop talking about it?
Fine. Let's just play, okay?
Good, okay.
Here we go, double sixes.
Here we go...
Here we go.
Come to Mama. Just getting ready to roll the dice.
What are you doing? Are you scratching?
No. This is what I do for luck, okay?
You're scratching.
Give me the dice.  No.
Give me the dice.  No. Here. There.
Look, double sixes.
We can't scratch. You know we can't. We'll scar.
I can't stop thinking about it. It's just so hard.
I just wanna grab these houses and rub them all over my body.
No. No.  Give it.
Come on.
You know you want it. You know you want it too. Come on.
Let's just be bad. It'll feel so good.
Oh, come on. Come on.
Uh-huh. Oh, God, help me.
Uh-huh. Good, huh? Yeah.
Oh, yeah. Okay, good. Now do me.
Do my back. Oh, come on. Harder.
There you go.
Don't move. Why?
Don't move. What are you?
Aah! Stop that. Stop that right now.
You know, I might've expected this of you, Phoebe.
But, Ryan, you're a military man.
You and Milton have to join us on the boat.
Karen will pack a lunch, you bring the kids. We'll make a day of it.
Oh, that sounds lovely. We're gonna have to set that up.
Oh, I better get back. Hope the baby feels better.
Oh, thanks. Thanks.
Bye-bye, Jeannie. Ha, ha.Bye-bye, Joseph.
What a phony.
Well, I'm sure you'll teach her a lesson when she steps off the dock onto nothing.
Hey, Mr. Douglas.  Sir.
Uh, listen, Bing, I got your memo.
So we're not gonna see the report until next Friday?
Well, the people in my group want to spend the holiday with family.
I have a family. I'm gonna be here.
Yeah, Bing. What's that about?
It's about cutting my people a little slack, you know, for morale.
If you wanna see some rough numbers, I can get them to you by Wednesday.
Rough numbers?
This company was not built on rough numbers. Right, Mr. Douglas?
Have the final numbers on my desk by Tuesday.
If you say so, sir.
Joseph's good, isn't he?
Well, I'm going to kill you.
Hey, hey, I just figured Joseph's the kind of guy who likes to mix it up.
You know, get in there, ruffle some feathers.
Why?
Look, I'm sorry, but that's what Joseph does.
Okay? If you try to pull something...
...he'll call you on it.
"What are you trying to pull?" he'll say.
Ooh. Duct tape.
Was I supposed to bring something too?
This is for the scratchy twins out there. I taped oven mitts to their hands.
You're strict.
Yeah, well, it's for their own good.
You know, I like the way you have efficiently folded this tab under.
See, in a tape emergency, you could shave valuable seconds off your time.
Exactly. Oh.
God, I love that I can be totally neurotic around you now.
Tell me the truth. Hmm.
Don't you like it better that everything on your desk is perpendicular?
If it's not a right angle, it is a wrong angle.
Very good.  Thank you.
You know what? Tomorrow, I'm gonna do your clocks.
You're gonna do what to my clocks?
I'm gonna set them to my time.
Well, I'm confused.
I thought we shared time.
No, no. See, in my bedroom I set my clock six minutes fast.
You wanna know why?
Because it's in a slightly different time zone than the kitchen?
You know what? Forget it.  No, come on, come on, tell me.
No, you don't understand.  No, come on.
No, you don't have any of these cute little obsessive things.
No, that's not true. That is not true.
Oh, yeah?  Yeah.
All right, well, tell me one of yours.
Okay.
Ah.
One of my things is, I always separate my sweat socks...
...from my dress socks.
Yeah. What if they get mixed up?
Boy, I would just, uh...
I would freak out.
You would not.
I can't believe this. I hate this. You're too normal.
I can't believe my boyfriend doesn't have a thing.
My boyfriend doesn't have a thing.
See, if anyone overheard that, I didn't come off well there.
Hey.
Mr. Douglas is looking for you. Why? Why is Mr. Douglas looking for me?
Because he has a strong suspicion that you dropped the ball on the Lender project.
Why? Why does he suspect that?
Because at first, he thought it was Joseph...
...but after he asked Joseph about it, turns out it was you.
Anyway, I just thought you should know. All right. That's it.
Look, Joey...
...l'm sorry, I realize this is the role of a lifetime for you...
...and if I could just fire Joseph, I would.
But unfortunately that's not possible.
So I'm gonna have to let both of you go.
What are you talking about? Everybody loves Joseph.
I don't. I hate Joseph.
Okay, I think he's a brown-nosing suck-up.
Oh, yeah?
Well, you can't fire Joseph. You know why?
He's not in your department.
All right, okay. All right, so I can't fire Joseph...
...but, uh, I can sleep with his wife.
Not Karen. Yeah, Karen.
I'm thinking about having an affair with her. Oh, you know what?
I just did.
What the hell are you doing to me, man?
Oh, it's not me.
It's my character.
Chandie.
Yeah, the rogue processor who seduces his coworkers' wives for sport...
...and then laughs about it the next day.
In fact, I have her panties right there in my drawer.
Really? No, freak show, she's fictional!
Come on! Hey. Take it easy.
If it means that much to you, I'll, uh... I'll go find something else.
Thank you.
It's just that I'm gonna miss Joseph.
I liked him. His wife.
She was hot.
Ow.
Please take these off. I swear I won't scratch.
No, sorry, hon. Monica's orders.
Well, that wasn't easy.
Okay, dinner's on.
And there's a peach cobbler warming in the oven.
So the plate's gonna be hot, but that shouldn't be a problem for you.
All right, you kids. Bye, now.
Bye. Oh, look, look.
A low-budget puppet show.
It's such a shame you can't see what finger I'm holding up.
All right.
Wine?  Please.
Oh. Spilled some.  I got it.
I must tell you, you look beautiful tonight.
What?
Sorry.
You look beautiful.
Oh.
You know what? That's it. That's it.
Oh! Oh!
Oh, yes. Oh.
Good.
You guys, did you...?
Monica, wake up.
Monica. What's up?
I thought of a thing.
Yeah?  Yeah.
I have to sleep, have to, on this side of the bed.
No, honey. You have to sleep on this side of the bed...
...because I have to sleep on this side of the bed.
Or so I would have you believe.
No. Big deal. So you have a side of the bed. Everybody has a side of the bed.
Hey, come on. You haven't heard my reason yet.
All right, go on. Okay.
I have to sleep on the west side...
...because I grew up in California...
...and otherwise...
...the ocean would be on the wrong side.
Oh, my God. You're a freak. Yeah.
How about that?
So, Ryan, where are you shipping off to? I really can't say.
So do you have any nuclear weapons onboard?
I can't say.
Well, do you get to look through one of those periscope thingies?
I'm sorry, but I can't say.
Wow, it's neat learning about submarines.
I better get out of here. I'm gonna miss my flight.
Okay, I'll walk you out.
Bye, Ryan.  Pleasure. Take care.
So do you, uh, think we could get you one of those uniform things?
You like that, do you?
Oh, yeah. I'll make some calls.
Okay.
Can you believe that's how we spent our two weeks?
We didn't do the romantic things I'd planned...
...like having a picnic in Central Park and, you know, a coffee at Central Perk.
Oh, I just got that.
Taxi.
Bye, you.
I'm sorry, we're clo...
Hey, sailor.
Is this what you had in mind?
Ha, ha. I'll say.
I'm shipping out tomorrow.
Well, then, uh...
...we better make this night count.
Oh, wait, I forgot to turn off the cappuccino machine.
Anchors aweigh.
Oh, wait. My purse, my purse, my purse.
Oh, you know what? I forgot to turn off the bathroom light.
All right, why don't I just meet you upstairs?
Honey.
How did the audition go? Incredible.
I met the director. You'll never believe who it was.
Who?
I'll give you one hint.
Warren Beatty.
Wow.
There's just one thing that might be a problem.
See, I had to kiss this guy.
Because he was just so darn cute?
No, part of the audition. I'm up for the part of this guy...
...who the main guy kisses.
Well, you're an actor. I say you just suck it up and you do it.
Or you just do it.
I did do it. I'm a professional.
What's the problem? After the scene...
...Mr. Beatty comes up to me and he says, "Good actor. Bad kisser."
Can you believe that? Me, not a good kisser.
That's like...
...Mother Teresa, not a good mother. Pfft.
Who cares what that guy thinks?
What does Warren Beatty know about kissing? Heh.
Oh. Heh, heh.
Friends S02E24: The One With Barry and Mindy's Wedding
What did your agent say?
Yep. This kiss thing is definitely a problem.
Mr. Beatty wants to see it again on Monday.
Man, I gotta figure out what I'm doing wrong.
Oh, okay. One of you girls come over here and kiss me.
Forget it. Yeah, right.
Hey, come on. I need your help here.
I'll do it. I've kissed him before. I can do it again.
See this, huh? This is a friend.
Uh-huh. Let's go.
Oh, wait. I have gum.
Okay.
Good. Very good. Firm, but tender.
I'd recommend you to a friend.
Then I don't know what the problem is.
Maybe you're not used to kissing men.
Maybe you tensed up a little.
Maybe you need to work on it.
Yeah, that makes sense.
Over my dead body.
And I'll be using his dead body as a shield.
Come out, honey. I'm telling you, you look good.
Tell her she looks good. Tell her she looks good.
Oh, my God! Ha, ha, ha.
You look so good!
I cannot believe I have to walk down the aisle in front of 200 people...
...looking like something you drink when you're nauseous.
So don't. I don't see why we have to go to this thing.
it's your ex-fiance's wedding.
Because I promised Mindy I would.
Yeah, well, you promised Barry you'd marry him.
You guys, I have to go. I'm the maid of honor.
Besides, I need to be in a room again with these people...
...and feel good about myself.
Someone's wearing the same clothes they had on last night. Get a little action?
I may have.
Whoo-hoo! Stud!
What's she look like? We haven't met.
We stayed up all night talking on the Internet.
Whoo-hoo! Geek!
I like this girl. I seriously like this girl.
You know how I tend to get a little defended and quippy?
Get out. No. Please.
Well, she called me on it, okay? She said, "Cut it out, get real."
And I did.
Wow.
What's that like?
It's like this. Me.
No jokes.
Stop it. You're freaking me out.
Yeah. I don't like you this way.
I'll see you guys later.
Bye, Richard. Bye-bye.
Bye, sweetie. I love you.
I love you too.
I think my boyfriend's ever so dreamy.
I wonder what our wedding will be like.
What are you talking about? What wedding?
Come on. You never talk about that?
No, never.
We're just living in the moment.
It is so nice for once not to get hung up on, "Where is this going?"
Afraid to ask him? Could not be more terrified.
I think you should seriously consider marriage.
Give Rachel another chance to dress like Princess Bubble Yum.
Where's Benny?
There he is!
Where's Benny?
There he is!
That's probably why babies learn to talk, so they can tell grownups to cut it out.
Hey, I got a question for you.
Just a little thing, no pressure.
Okay.
Do you ever, uh, think about the future?
Sure, I do.
Yeah? Am I in it?
Honey...
...you are it.
Oh, God. You're about to get so lucky.
Yeah?  Yeah.
Keep talking.  Well...
...sometimes I think about selling my practice.
We could move to France.
Make French toast. Ooh.
Okay, so...
...we're in France...
...and we're making the toast.
Do you see a little bassinet in the corner?
Like a hound?
Not a basset.
A bassinet.
You really need the bassinet?
Well, I just think the baby would keep falling off the dog.
Do you not see kids in our future?  Oh. Heh.
I love children.
I have children.
I don't wanna be 70 when our kids go off to college...
...and our life can finally start.
Hm. Look.
I want you...
...now.
Well, that's great. We don't need to talk about this now.
Really, I mean this is so, like, way, way, way in the future.
I'm talking hovercrafts and apes taking over the planet. Heh, heh.
Come on, Chandler. I want this part so much.
Just one kiss. I won't tell anyone.
Joey, no means no.
Hey.
I'm sorry, we don't have your sheep.
Aw, Rach, I think you look cute.
And you. You...
You, I could eat you with a spoon.  Get away from me. I said no.
Richard buzzed. He's downstairs.
Richard's here? I should run down, say goodbye to him.
Bye. Good luck.
How's your date with your cyber-chick going?
Hey, what is all that?
It's a web site. It's the Guggenheim Museum.
She likes art...
...and I like funny words.
What does she mean by "H.H."?
It means we're holding hands.
Are you the cutest?
I'm afraid I might just be.
I think it's so great that you're totally into this person...
...yet for all you know, she could be 90 years old or have two heads.
It could be a guy.
It's not a guy, all right? I know her.
It could be like a big, giant guy.
Man, I got this close to him, and Monica kneed me in the back.
What's going on?
We're wondering if Chandler's girlfriend is a girl.
Ask her how long she's gonna live.
Women live longer than men.
How do you not fall down more?
Okay, ask her what is her method of birth control.
All right.
"My husband is sleeping with his secretary."
She's married?
At least we know she's a woman.
I can't believe she's married.
Oh, man, I'm sorry.
This must be really tough for you.
I read this article that says you're not supposed to throw rice at weddings...
...because when pigeons eat rice, it kills them.
That's why you never see pigeons in sushi bars.
See, we're having fun. Oh, absolutely.
I'm not even thinking about that thing that we're not gonna think about.
Neither am I.
Hey, there. Are you all right?
Yeah. But in the bathroom, I saw the window I crawled out of at my wedding.
And, God, I just started thinking I shouldn't be here. I shouldn't.
People are gonna be looking at me and judging me and thinking about the last time.
Sweetie, it's gonna be okay. It's a wedding.
Generally, people focus on the bride.
I know, you're right.
Alrighty. Everybody look at me. Good.
It's time. Bridesmaids and ushers...
...let's see two lines. Thank you.
I'll see you after the thing.
Okay. Good luck. Thank you. Okay.
Okay.
Ah.
Why didn't you tell me?
What could I do?
Stand up and shout, "Hey, Rachel, your butt is showing!"
Oh, my God. This is so humiliating.
The only thing that tops that was when I was in eighth grade...
...and I had to sing the "Copacabana" in front of the entire school.
Two lines into it, I ran and freaked out.
Oh, my God. My entire life's flashing before my eyes.
Rach, look, I remember that. It wasn't so bad.
Ross, would you stop! You got me. I'm dating you.
Rachel.
Hi, Mr. Weinberg. Hi, Mrs. Weinberg.
It's wonderful to see you again, my dear.
In fact, I hardly expected to see so much.
You told me you didn't see anything.  I tell you a lot of things.
Well, it's wonderful to have you up and about again, dear.
Stay well.
That's the third time someone has said something like that to me today.
Rach! Hi.
Oh, my God, I'm married! I know!
I'm Mrs. Dr. Barry Hunter, hyphen, Farber.
I am so proud of you, Min.
Min.
Oh, Rach. Still here.
At our wedding, they were packing up the chopped liver about now.
Yeah, I love that story.
Ahem. I have a question for you guys.
Why do people keep saying it's good to see me up and about?
After you ran out on your wedding...
...Barry's parents told people you were sort of...
...insane.
Insane?  From the syphilis.
What?
What were they gonna say? You didn't love me anymore? Come on.
Angela?
Joey Tribbiani.
Listen, what are you doing tonight?
I know you're seeing that guy. I was thinking maybe you could bring him...
Hello? Hello?
You gonna answer her? That's the 10th bing-bong message she's sent.
She wants to know what's wrong. What's wrong? You're married!
That's what's wrong!
Oh, my.
What? She wants to meet you in person.
Look, Phoebe, I wanted to meet her in person too.
But she's married. She has a husband.
What if the husband is the wrong guy and you are the right guy?
You don't get chances like this all the time.
If you don't meet her, you'll kick yourself when you're 80...
...which is hard to do and that's how you break a hip.
Okay. I'll do it.
Okay, great! Put on your shoes and then march out there and meet her.
No, wait! You have to take a shower because ew!
And I'll get the...
No, you have to answer her. Answer her first.
No, make some coffee because it's too much.
Tall and tan, and young and lovely
Okay, one more, please. I'm gonna get it in this time.
Okay, last chance.
Again, I'm sorry.
You know what, maybe I don't need to have children.
Maybe I just think I do because that's what society...
...and by that I mean my mom...
...has always convinced me that I...
I do.
I have to have children. I'm sorry, I just do.
Yo, could I have your attention?
Best man making a toast here.
Thank you. Ahem.
I remember when Barry got home from his first date with Rachel.
Huh?
What? You hired the same band. I can't use the same speech?
Thank you. Thank you very much.
Anyway, I wish you both...
...a wonderful life together. Aw.
And, Rachel.
What? No, no, in all seriousness.
Not a lot of women would have the guts to come back here.
And even fewer who'd do it with their asses hanging out.
That's it.
I'd like to add something to that.
What are you adding? What are you adding?  It's okay. It's okay.
Most of you don't know me. I'm Rachel's boyfriend...
Oh, dear God.
...Ross.
And I'd just like to say that...
...it did take a lot of courage for Rachel to come here tonight.
And just for the record...
...she did not run out on Barry because she had syphilis.
What are you doing? I'm serious.
The reason...
...she walked out on Barry is simply that...
...she didn't love him.
Which, incidentally, worked out pretty well for me. Heh, heh.
Cheers.
See you in the parking lot.  No, Rach.
And once again, she is out of here!
Okay, who had 9:45? Hm?
Heh.
You know what, Bar? I'm not gonna leave.
I probably should, but I'm not.
I promised myself I'd make it through at least one of your weddings.
Tonight, all I wanted was to make it through this evening...
...with a little bit of grace and dignity.
Well, I guess we can all agree that's not gonna happen.
I guess there's nothing really left to say...
...except...
Her name was Lola
She was a showgirl
With yellow feath...
Feathers in her hair
And a dress cut down to there
She would...
Merengue  Merengue
Thank you, honey.
And do the cha-cha
And while she'd like to be a star Tony always tended bar
Wait, wait!
Everybody!
Copa
Copacabana
The hottest spot north of Havana
At the Copa
Copacabana
Music and passion were always In fashion at the Copa
Okay.
I'll do it.
You'll do what?
If kids is what it takes to be with you, then kids it is.
Oh, my God.
If I have to, I'll do it all again.
I'll do the 4:00 feeding thing.
I'll go to the PTA meetings.
I'll coach the soccer team.
Really? Yeah, if I have to.
Monica...
...I don't wanna lose you.
So if I have to do it all again...
...then I will.
You are the most wonderful man.
And if you hadn't have said...
..."If I have to," like, 17 times...
...then I'd be saying, "Okay, let's do it."
But you're not.
Oh, my God. I can't believe what I'm getting ready to say.
I wanna have a baby.
But I don't want to have one with someone who doesn't really want to have one.
God.
I love you.
I know you do.
Me too.
So what now?
I guess we just...
...keep dancing.
Where is she? Where is she?
Oh, hey, I have a question.
Where is she?
Chandler. Relax, Chandler. She'll be here.
Oh, oh, oh. That's her.
Yeah, because life's just that kind.
PHOEBE: You gotta stop staring at the door...
...like a watched pot.
If you keep looking at it, the door's never gonna boil.
I think what you have to do is try not to...
Oh, my God.
Oh...
...my...
...God.
Oh...
...my...
...God.
All right.
I've been feeling incredibly guilty because I wanna be a good friend.
And damn it, I am a good friend. So shut up and close your eyes.
Wow.
You are a good friend.
The audition was this morning, and I didn't get it.
But that was a hell of a kiss.
Rachel is a very lucky girl.
