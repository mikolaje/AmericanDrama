莴苣很脏吗012---Uh-huh. Is it dirty?
放心好了  我会清洗的012---Oh, no, no. I'm gonna wash it.

我不干了012---I'm out of here!
喂012---Hello?
瑞秋不在  需要我转达什么吗012---Rachel's not here right now. Can I take a message?
是哪个凯西012---All right. And how do we spell Casey?
是《凯西出击》 或是《凯希阳光合唱团》那个012---Is it like "at the bat" or "and The Sunshine Band"?
好  再见012---Okay, bye-bye.
嘿  这个凯西是谁啊012---Hey, who's this Casey?
一个她看电影时遇到的家伙012---Some guy she met at the movies.
他要找她干嘛012---What does he want with her?
我猜他想跟她跳点小舞012---I'm guessing he wants to do a little dance...
也就是去〝嘿咻一下〞012---...you know, make a little love...
哦  也就等于是 〝上床〞去012---Well, pretty much get down tonight.
我不晓得  我不…012---I don't know. I don't...
我不懂  两个月前  我跟瑞秋还很亲密012---I don't get it! Two months ago, Rachel and I were this close.
现在我却在帮一个  她看电影时遇到的家伙留话012---Now I'm taking messages from guys she meets at the movies?
这个凯西才该帮我留言  你们知道吗012---I mean, this Casey should be taking down my messages, you know?
瑞秋和我才应该在一起…012---Or Rachel and I should be together...
然后我们一起请电话秘书012---...and we should get some kind of message service.
等等吧  会有那么一天的012---Hang in there. It's gonna happen.
你怎么知道012---Now how do you know that?
因为她是你的龙虾012---Because she's your lobster.
哦  她会说明的012---Oh, she's going somewhere.
龙虾都会爱上一生的伴侣  这是常识012---It's a known fact that lobsters fall in love and mate for life.
知道吗  我们真的可以目睹  年老的龙虾夫妇…012---You know what? You can actually see old lobster couples...
在他们的水槽里  钳子牵着钳子漫步  就像这样…012---...walking around their tank, holding claws, like...
有觉得好一点了吗012---Hey, you feeling better?
我想洗到第五次  就可以把面试的记忆冲掉了012---Yeah, I think that fifth shower actually got the interview off me.
你还有别的机会吗012---So do you have any other possibilities?
我是有机会付不出房租012---Yeah. There is the possibility that I won't make rent.
摩妮卡  如果你想要  我可以借你一点钱012---Monica, if you want, I can lend you money.
不  不  如果我无法立刻还你钱012---No, no. If I couldn't pay you back right away...
每次见到你  我就会感到充满罪恶感与压力012---...then I'd feel guilty and tense every time I saw you.
何不直接找爸爸妈妈借012---Oh. Then why don't you borrow it from Mom and Dad?
反正你在他们面前  已经充满罪恶感与压力了012---You feel guilty and tense around them already.
何不顺便捞点钱出来012---Might as well make some money off of them.
说的有理012---The man's got a point. Ohh.
那闪闪发亮的是什么东东012---What is that sparkly thing?
这玩意儿012---That thing? It's a, uh...

我有戴着不就表示012---Doesn't the fact that I wore it...
我有多重视我们的友谊了012---...say how much our friendship means to me?
