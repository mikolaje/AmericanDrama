有人想喝东西吗  我要浓缩咖啡012---Anybody need anything?  Oh, I'll have an espresso.
我自己来好了012---Oh, I'll get it.
叫你去的话说不定最后会被你喝掉012---If I ask you to, you'll end up drinking it yourself.
她这样说太不公平了  对啊012---That is so unfair.  I know.
你怎么可能抢了范达美之后  还把她的咖啡喝掉012---Like you'd drink her coffee after what you did to her with Van Damme?
乔伊  今晚我不能跟你打壁球了012---I have to cancel racquetball tonight.
马塞尔的训练师  愿意把他借给我几小时012---Marcel's trainer will let me have him for a couple of hours.

我熟了012---...I am done!
呃012---Uh...
用叉子什么012---Stick a fork what?
像你煎牛排那样啊012---Like when you're cooking a steak.
我不吃肉012---Oh, I don't eat meat.
那你怎么知道青菜熟了没012---How do you know vegetables are done?
不知道啊  吃了就会知道012---Well, you don't. You eat them and you can tell.
那就吃我吧  我熟了012---Okay, then eat me, I'm done!
唔012---Mm.
我碰到了完美的女人012---I've met the perfect woman. - What?
我们坐在沙发上  在亲热…012---We're sitting on her couch, fooling around...
突然她转过来对我说012---...and then she turns to me and says:
〝你想在电梯里做吗〞012---"Did you ever want to do it in an elevator?"
你说了什么012---What did you say?
我想我当时说的是…012---I believe my exact words were:
你怎么知道要不要在电梯里做012---How do you know if you wanna do that?
你就是会知道012---Oh, you just know.
我们得走了  我有一个30分钟内的餐厅预约012---Oh, we gotta go. Got a reservation in 30 minutes.
不  不  不012---No, no, no.

两百秒钟的热情  我们得走了012---Two hundred seconds of passion! We gotta go.
不过…012---But, um...
我有个建议012---...here's an idea.
你有穿过女人的内裤吗012---Have you ever worn women's underwear?
其实有…012---Well, yes, actually...
可是我穿的是爱德娜阿姨的内裤012---...but, uh, they were my Aunt Edna's.
而且一共有三个人一起穿012---And there were three of us in there.
我在想如果你今晚吃饭时012---I was thinking it would be, um, kind of sexy...
穿我的内裤   一定会很性感012---...if you wore mine tonight at dinner.
你要我穿你的内裤012---You want me to wear your panties?
可以吗012---Could you?
如果我穿你的内裤012---If I was wearing your underwear...
那你要穿什么012---...then, uh, what would you be wearing?
你真是火辣012---You're swell!
你看  我做了  马塞尔最爱的香蕉蛋糕012---I made Marcel's favorite dish, banana cake...

我也没特别准备什么012---It's not like I, uh, had anything special planned, you know.
好  好  再见012---Yeah, okay. Okay. Okay, bye.
瑞秋  你先说吧012---Okay. Rachel, why don't you start talking first?
好  我根本什么都没做错012---All right. I feel that this is totally unjustified.
她说可以的啊  我什么都没做…012---She gave me the green light, I did nothing...
你以为我在电视上看不到你吗012---Do you think I can't see you in the TV set?
摩妮卡  你有什么话要说就说好了012---Monica, if there's something you'd like to share...
你没权利跟他出去012---You had no right to date him!
这太荒唐了吧…  你出卖我012---That's the most ridiculous...  You sold me out!
我没有  你就是有…012---I did not!  You absolutely...
你让我讲好不好012---Would you let me talk!
你刚刚弹我的头012---Did you just flick me?
因为你不等我说完…012---Well, you wouldn't let me finish and I was...
很痛耶012---Ow, that hurt! Ow.
不要弹了012---Quit flicking!

好  你们住手的话我就放手012---All right. Now, I will let go if you both stop.
你要我不再见他吗012---Oh! You want me to stop seeing him? Uh-huh.
你要我跟他说  他应该跟你约会吗012---You want me to just tell him you're seeing him instead?
你就是要这样吗  好012---Is that what you want? Okay.
你要这样就是了012---Oh, that's what you want?
对012---Yes.
好  好012---Fine! Fine!

有点跑出来了012---And a little out.
你是导演的助理啊012---So assistant to the director?
这个工作真棒  你的责任一定很大…012---That's an exciting job. You must have a ton of responsibilities...
我不负责选角012---I don't do the casting.
你们想吃什么012---So, what are you guys gonna eat?
为什么我只想把冰块含在嘴里012---How come all I can think about is putting that ice in my mouth...
然后舔遍你全身呢012---...and licking you all over?
因为我上的是男子高中  现在上帝要补偿我了012---Because I went to an all-boys high school, and God is making up for it?
我现在就想要你…012---I want you right here...
此时此刻012---...right now.
此时此刻012---Right now, right here?
你不觉得  这里算是公共场合吗012---Don't you think we're in kind of a public place?
菜单里真的有虾子呢012---They do have the shrimp.
跟我在厕所里会合012---Oh. Meet me in the bathroom.
我要去上厕所012---I'm going to the bathroom now.

噢012---Oh.
好  现在呢  我要看你只穿内裤的样子012---All right. Now, I would like to see you wearing nothing but them.
把衣服脱掉012---Take your clothes off.
我要提醒你…012---But, uh, I hope you realize this means...
这样会错过服务生介绍特餐的时间012---...we'll miss hearing about the specials.
快点012---Come on, hurry!
你是只想匆促了事  还是要按部就班来012---Do you want this done quick or done right?
好  转过身去  我要看你的背后012---All right, turn around. I wanna see you from behind.

你要我夹紧什么东西吗012---So you want me to, uh, clench anything or?
苏西012---Susie?
苏西012---Susie?
这是你四年级时欺负我的报应012---This, ha, ha, is for the fourth grade.
你在说什么  我在说什么012---Huh? What do you mean? What do I mean?

我一直到十八岁都是内裤苏西012---I was Susie Underpants till I was 18!
那是四年级的事情  你怎么会气到现在012---That was in fourth grade! How could you still be upset?
嗯…012---Well, um...
你二十年后打电话给我  告诉我你还气不气今天的事吧012---Call me in 20 years and tell me if you're still upset about this.
你要知道  你的内裤我不会还你了012---I hope you realize you're not getting these underpants back!
我真是不敢相信012---I can't believe this. Ha, ha.
两个礼拜前  我还在看《绝命杀阵》…012---Just two weeks ago, I was watching Sudden Death...
现在我却在跟尚克劳范达美约会012---...and now I'm on a date with Jean-Claude Van Damme.
你可以打倒那个人吗012---Can you beat up that guy?
可以012---Yeah.
你可以打倒那个人吗  当然012---Can you beat up that guy?  Sure.
实在是太棒了012---Oh, this is so wild.
我得承认  我很讶异你会答应跟我来个盲目约会012---I gotta admit, I was surprised that you agreed to go on a blind date.
通常我是不会答应的012---Normally, I would not do it.
是吗012---Yeah?
那为什么会为我破例012---What made you make the exception for me?
因为瑞秋跟我说012---Rachel told me, uh...
你非常想跟我和茱儿·巴莉摩来个三人行012---...you were dying to have a threesome with me and, uh, Drew Barrymore.
对了  茱儿有些原则…012---By the way, Drew has some ground rules and...
快跟我说对不起  不要012---Say you're sorry!  No!
瑞秋  说  不要！012---Say it!
不要  我不要012---No! I'm not gonna!
说  你说啊  很好012---Say it! Say it! Great! Oh!
瑞秋012---Rachel.

那是我最爱的毛衣  是我第三次约会必穿的毛衣012---That is my favorite sweater! That is my third-date sweater!
说对不起012---Say you're sorry.
你要玩是吧  那就来玩吧012---You wanna play? Okay, let's play.
来玩啊012---Let's play.
你想干嘛012---What are you gonna do?
把我毛衣还来  不然我就把意大利面酱倒进你包里012---Give me back my sweater or it's handbag marinara.
你才没胆那样做012---You don't have the guts.
是吗  至少我不会没胆跟喜欢的人说他很帅012---Yeah? At least I wasn't too chicken to tell some guy he was cute.
好了  住手  你们别疯了012---Oh, all right, stop! Stop the madness!
你们两个疯了012---This is crazy!
你们谁还记得你们本来在吵什么吗012---Who can remember why you're fighting in the first place?
对  没错012---Yes, that's right.
可是…012---But still...
看看你的包包012---Look at your purse!
看看你的毛衣012---Look at your sweater!
看看你们两个012---Look at yourselves!
我会帮你把毛衣补好012---I'll help you fix your sweater.
我会帮你…012---I'll help you...

我很抱歉  我明知道你喜欢他  却还跟他约会012---I'm sorry I went out with him when I knew you liked him.
我很抱歉我跟你借了手套012---I'm sorry that I borrowed your gloves.
乔伊012---Joey?
妈012---Ma?
乔伊012---Joey!
钱德  你怎么还在这儿  我以为你们已经走了012---What are you doing here? I thought you guys took off.
不  不  不  是她走了  还把我的衣服拿走012---She took off with my clothes!
你什么都没穿喔  不完全是012---Are you naked in there? Well, not exactly.
我穿着丁字裤012---I'm wearing panties.
呵012---Huh.
你都穿丁字裤吗012---You, uh, always wear panties?
不  这是我第一次穿012---No, no. This is the first time.
哇  你运气也太差了吧012---Wow. Talk about your bad luck!
才第一次试穿丁字裤  衣服就被人偷走012---I mean, the first time you try panties and someone walks off with your clothes.
我不是要试穿  是苏西要我穿的012---I was not trying them out. Susie asked me to wear them.
让我看看012---Let me see!
不要  我才不要让任何人看012---No! I'm not letting you or anybody else see, ever!
好啦  好啦012---All right, all right!
哇012---Whoa.
有人在用“牙线”012---Someone's flossing!
乔伊  不是每个人都喜欢你这样的012---Joey, some people don't like that.
钱德穿着丁字裤012---Chandler's wearing panties.
什么012---What?
我看看  你不用看吧！012---Let me see! You don't have to see!
嗨  翘臀012---Hi, tushy!
内裤借我穿  不行012---One of you give me your underpants.  Oh, no.
我帮不了你  我没穿内裤012---I'm not wearing any.
你怎么会没穿内裤012---How can you not be wearing any?
因为看到一个男的穿了粉红丁字裤  让我火热难耐012---Oh. I'm getting heat from the guy in the hot-pink thong.
