不可能  她去机场了012---No way. I'm telling you, she went to the airport.
她要去对罗斯下手了012---And she's gonna go for it with Ross.
哇  我的天啊  简直大条啊012---Oh, my God. This is huge. This...
这件事比大条还大条  这简直是…012---This is bigger than huge. This is...
好吧  有什么比大条还大条的012---All right, what's bigger than huge?
就这件事  也对012---Um, this?  Yes.
你们理新发型了012---Guys, you got new haircuts!
对  我们理了  多亏了这位美发大师沙宣菲比012---Yes, yes, we did. Thanks to Vidal Buffay.
因为〝我们的光彩来自您的风釆〞012---Because, you know: "If you don't look good, we don't look good."
我爱死那个声音了012---I love that voice! Ha, ha.
你们大家  喔  瑞秋012---You guys! Oh, oh.
机场  机场  罗斯  有人陪012---Airport. Airport. Ross. Not... Not alone.
茱莉  搂着她012---Julie. Arm around her!
痛  痛  痛012---Unh! Cramp! Cramp! Cramp!
我想她可能是想表达什么012---Okay, I think she's trying to tell us something.
快  快找出句子的动词012---Quick, get the verbs.
你  你012---Ow. You! You!
你不是说他喜欢我吗  你012---You said he liked me! You! You...!
你们这两个慢半拍的012---You slowpokes!
没错  行李全在我们手上012---That's all right, Rach. We got the bags. Uh...
嗨  哈罗012---Hi. Hello.
茱莉  她是我妹妹摩妮卡  他是钱德012---Julie, this is my sister, Monica. This is Chandler.
嘿  菲比  嗨012---Hey. Phoebe, hi. Mwah.
乔伊  你还好吗  哈罗012---Joey, what up?  Hey.
大家注意  这位是茱莉  茉莉012---Everyone, this is Julie. Julie.
噢012---ALL: Oh.
嗨  嗨012---Hi! Hi!
就当我不在场  当我们根本没见过面012---Hi! But I'm not here, you haven't met me.
明天没连坐20小时的飞机  我给人的第一印象会比较好012---I'll make a better impression when I don't have 20 hours of plane on me.
别忘了搭巴士的时间  哦 我的天012---And bus. Oh, my God!
那个大叫的家伙…  吐口水的人012---With the screaming guy... And the spitting.
你们一定得听这件事012---You gotta hear this story.
我们搭了一辆有200年之久的巴士012---We're on this bus that's 200 years old.
最少200年012---Two hundred, at least.
有个家伙… 后来鸡在她大腿上大便了012---And this guy... And the chicken poops in her lap! Ha!
真是对不起012---Oh, I'm so sorry.
我把结局说出来了  是吗012---I just gave away the ending, didn't I?
我刚刚在计程车上  听过这个故事…012---Ugh, I just heard this story in the cab...
然后我就再也忘不了012---...and it is all I can think about.
太令人意外了012---This is amazing. I mean, how...?
怎么会这样子的呢  我们是在同一个研究所012---How did this happen?  Ross and I were in grad school together.
毕业后就没见过面了  我一到中国012---We haven't seen each other since then. I land in China...
你们猜负责的人是谁012---...guess who's in charge of the dig?
茱莉012---Julie!
这不是太妙了吗012---Julie. Isn't that great?
真是妙得让人想踹你一脚  再对着你的脖子吐口水012---Isn't that just kick-you-in-the-crotch, spit-on-your-neck fantastic?
只是一种形容的方式012---It's an expression.
我们只是很快的  来打声招呼012---We just wanted to say a quick hi.
然后我们就要去看宝宝  然后睡一觉012---Then we're gonna go see the baby. Then get some sleep.
现在其实是明晚六点钟  我们的时差012---Yeah, it's 6:00 tomorrow night, our time.
好  千万别告诉我明天会怎样  因为我喜欢惊喜012---Well don't tell us what's gonna happen, though Because I like to be surprised.
再见  再见012---Bye!  Bye.
瑞秋 可以给我咖啡吗012---Rach. Can I get some coffee?
当然好 谢谢012---Sure. Thank you.
嘿  瑞秋…  你跟他说了没  没012---Hey, Rach... Did you talk to him yet?  No.
那就甭想喝012---Then, no.
你在中国到底发生什么事了012---So, what the hell happened to you in China?
上回我们离开这里的时候  你还爱着…012---I mean, when last we left you, you were in love with, you know.
我知道  曾经是那样没错012---I know. I know I was.
可是我心中一直有个声音  在提醒我…012---But there was always this voice inside that kept saying:
〝那是不可能的  你要往前走〞 你知道那是谁的声音吧012---"It's never gonna happen. Move on." You know whose voice that was?
上帝吗012---God?
是你啊  老兄012---It was you, pal.
也许是上帝在模仿我012---Well, maybe it was God doing me.
你说得没错  在她眼里我只是一个朋友  就这样012---You were right. She looks at me and sees a friend. That's all.
然后我就遇到茱莉  我们在一起很棒012---And then I met Julie, and... I don't know. We're having a great time.
要不是你的话  我绝对不可能跟她在一起的012---I never would have gone for it with her, if it hadn't been for you.
嗯  你欠我一个大人情了  大个儿012---Well, you owe me one, big guy.
你的柠檬汁来了012---Here's your lemonade.
我没叫啊012---I didn't order lemonade.
那就拿回去还  不然他们会算钱的012---Oh. Well then you better go take that back. They're gonna charge you for that.
快  快  快 快点 快点012---But... Go, go, go! Come on, come on!
好  你有什么发现012---Okay, so, uh, what did you find out?
他说…012---He said...
他说他们在一起很棒  我很抱歉012---He said they're having a great time. - I'm sorry. - What?
不过  只要你愿意用心看待  还是有一线希望的012---But the silver lining, if you wanna see it...
也就是  这全是他自行决定的…012---...is that he made this decision all by himself...
绝对没有任何外来力量的协助012---...without any outside help whatsoever.
这样怎么会叫一线希望呢012---How is that a silver lining?
必须很用力  才能看到〝一线“希望012---You have to really wanna see it.
讽刺的是  这些家伙都是上体育课时没人愿意挑的012---Ironically, these guys were picked last in gym.
嘿 菲比012---Hey, Pheebs.
知道我在想什么吗  哦，可以012---You know what I'm thinking? Oh, okay.
在想…012---How...
你很久没跟人嘿咻了…012---...it's been so long since you've had sex...
所以你在想  现在有没有什么新花招012---...you're wondering if they've changed it?
不是  不过现在  我真的在想这件事了012---No. Although now that's what I'm thinking.
那你刚才在想什么012---So, what were you thinking?
你帮他们剪了很棒的发型  我在想你也可以帮我剪012---I was thinking you gave the guys great haircuts. I thought you'd like to do mine.
哦  不要012---Oh! No.
有何不可  因为我只是…012---Why not? Because I'm just...
我非常挑剔 而且是令人难以忍受的控制狂012---I'm incredibly anal and an unbelievable control freak.
不 你不是  我知道我不是  不过你是012---No, you're not. I know I'm not, but you are.
我只是不想伤你的感情012---I was trying to spare your feelings.
喂  嗨  你好012---Hello? Oh, hi.
好  罗斯  等一下  茱莉找你012---Yeah, hold on a second. Ross, Julie for you.
喂  嗨012---Hello? Hi.
嘿  有人认识什么好裁缝师吗012---Hey. Anybody know a good tailor?
有衣服要修改吗  不是012---You need clothes altered? No, no.
我只是想找个人拿粉笔在我身上画012---I'm just looking for a man to draw on me with chalk.
去找法兰克 我家的人总是找他012---Go see Frankie. My family's been going to him forever.
我15岁时第一套西装就是他做的 不 等等 是16岁012---He did my first suit when I was 15. No, wait, 16.
不  抱歉  是15岁012---No, excuse me, heh, 15.
好吧  1990年到底是什么时候012---All right, when was 1990?
好吧  只要棉花棒碰到东西  就别继续挖下去了012---Okay, you have to stop the Q-Tip when there's resistance.
好  好的  甜心  我们待会儿见了012---Okay. Okay. Sweetheart, I'll see you later.

她没挂掉012---She didn't hang up.
好吧  不行012---Okay, no.
不  你来挂电话012---No, you hang up.
你  你…012---You. You. Yo...
抱歉  我还以为你是在对我说012---Sorry, I thought you were talking to me.
瑞秋 对不起012---Rachel. Heh. Sorry.
我再打给她   好吧012---I'll just call her back. Okay.
对不起  刚刚断线了012---Hi, sweetie. I'm sorry. We got disconnected.
不 你挂012---No, you hang up.
好吧  我怎么会这样012---Okay, okay, okay. How did this happen to me? How?
一个礼拜前  两个礼拜前  我还好好的012---A week ago, two weeks ago, I was fine.
罗斯只是罗斯  就是一个家伙012---Ross was just Ross. Just this guy.
如今  突然间  他是罗斯…012---Now all of a sudden, he's Ross...
是我无福拥有的好家伙012---...ugh, this really great guy that I can't have.
以前我也希望你能拥有他012---Sweetie, I wanted you to have him too.
我知道012---I know you did.
我会熬过去的012---Ugh. I'm just gonna deal with it. I'm just gonna deal with it
我得离开这里012---I gotta get out of here!
我不管你们怎么说  她真的有心事012---I don't care what you guys say. Something's bothering her.
知道吗  我想我当年是16岁012---You know, I think I was 16.
拜托  只要后面修一点点就好012---Please, just a little bit off the back.
我还是〝不要〞012---Um, I'm still on "no."
早  嘿012---Uh, morning. Hey.
你们可以先闭上眼睛吗012---Could you close your eyes for a sec?
不  不  不  我不会再上你的当了012---Oh, no, no, no. I'm not falling for that again.
怎么了  我昨晚做了一件傻事012---What's going on? I sort of did a stupid thing last night.
什么傻事012---What stupid thing did you do?
巴洛  你去穿好衣服  然后就可以走了  再见012---Why don't you just go get dressed... ...then you'll be on your way. Bye-bye.
瑞秋  怎么会这样012---Rachel, how did this happen?
我昨晚刚巧遇到他了012---I don't know, I kind of ran into him last night.
在哪里遇到的  他的公寓  这是果汁吗012---Where?  At his apartment. Is this juice?
喂  你忘了你甩他是因为他想钓菲比012---Whoa. And the fact that you dumped him because he hit on Phoebe?
哦  天啊  我晓得  我真可悲  我是个没用的人012---Oh, God, I know. I'm pathetic, I'm a loser.
你不可悲  你只是悲伤012---Honey, you're not pathetic. You're just sad.
伤心人总是会做傻事的012---Yeah. People do stupid things when they're upset.
我的天  如果我因每个我不该上床的人而都得到五毛钱…012---My God, if I had a nickel for every guy I wish I hadn't...
我们现在谈的是你犯下的大错012---But this is about your horrible mistake.
嗨  嘿012---Hi. Hey!
嗨  抱歉我们迟到了012---Hi... Sorry we're late.
我们刚刚在…012---We were, uh...
哦  是跟触摸有关的012---Well, there was touching.
嘿   罗斯  巴洛012---Hey, Ross! Paolo. Ha.
搞什…嗯…012---What a...
你来这里干什么012---What, uh...? What are you doing here?
我来上瑞秋012---I do Raquel. Ah.
这么说他回来了012---So, uh, he's back?
对  他回来了  有问题吗012---Yeah, he's back. Is that a problem?
不  没有问题012---No, not a problem.
很好  很欣慰不构成问题012---Good. Glad it's not a problem.
你必须别碰我的屁股012---Okay, you're gonna have to not touch my ass.
嗯  尽管有美味的贝果  以及触手可及的紧张局势存在…012---Well, despite the yummy bagels and palpable tension...
我还是得去改我的长裤012---...I've got pants that need to be altered.
看到法兰克的时候  跟他说乔伊崔比亚尼问候他012---Oh, when you see Frankie, tell him Joey Tribbiani says hello.
这样子他就会懂了012---He'll know what it means.
你确定他能解开如此深奥的谜题012---You sure he's gonna be able to crack that code?
真好玩  巴洛上次在这里时  我的头发还很短很可爱012---It's funny. The last time Paolo was here, my hair was so much shorter and cuter.
好吧012---All right. Okay.
但你得保证  你不会管太多  太唠叨…012---But... But! You have to promise that you will not be all controlly and bossy...
还有别太摩妮卡就是了012---...and all, you know, Monica about it.
我保证  好  我看看012---I promise. All right, let's see.
好  你们有些会被修剪  有些不会012---Now, some of you are gonna get cut and some of you aren't.
不过我保证  你们全都不会感到痛楚012---But I promise, none of you will feel a thing.
好012---Okay.
够了  我不干了   干嘛  我什么也没说012---All right, that's it. I quit. What? I didn't say anything!
但这不是相信人的表情012---Yeah, but this isn't the face of a person who trusts a person.
这种表情是…012---This is the face of a person who, you know...
不相信人的表情012---...doesn't trust a person.
我很抱歉 我很抱歉012---I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Phoebe.
只是这比我们讨论的发型  短多了012---It's just a little shorter than what we had discussed.
你放轻发好吗  我知道自己在做什么012---Would you relax? I know what I am doing.
这就是那位先生的发型012---This is how he wears it.
哪位的发型  黛咪·摩尔012---How who wears it? Demi Moore.
黛咪·摩尔不是〝先生〞012---Heh. Demi Moore is not a he.
哦  他在《二八佳人花公子》 和《十全十美》中是个〝先生〞啊012---Well, he was a he in Arthur and in 10.
那个人是杜利·摩尔012---That's Dudley Moore!
我说的是  我要黛咪·摩尔的发型012---I said I wanted it like Demi Moore!
哦  哦  哦  我的天啊012---Oh. Oh! Oh, my God!
哦  天啊  哦  我的天啊012---Oh, God! Oh, my God!
哦  我的天  我很抱歉012---Oh, my God! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
黛咪·摩尔是哪一个啊012---Which one is Demi Moore?
她是《桃色机密》 《桃色交易》 和《第六感生死恋》那个女星012---She's the actress that was in Disclosure, Indecent Proposal, Ghost!
她的发型很棒的  我知道012---Oh, she's got gorgeous hair. I know!
我的天啊012---Oh, my God!
裤管的褶边要多长  要跟这件长裤的存活期一样长012---How long do you want the cuffs? At least as long as I have the pants.
我刚听懂012---I just got that.
现在要量你的内侧长度012---Okay. Now we'll do your inseam.
她的情况怎样  现在还很难说012---How is she? It's too soon to tell.
她在休息了  起码这是一个好现象012---She's resting, which is a good sign.
头发的情况呢  我不想骗你012---How's the hair? I'm not gonna lie to you, Ross.
看起来不妙012---It doesn't look good.
我有夹起一边 似乎能阻止卷曲情况012---I put a clip on one side, which seems to have stopped the curling.
我们可以去看她了吗012---Can we see her?
你的发型看起来太棒了  反而会让她更难过012---Your hair looks too good. It would upset her.
罗斯  何不由你进去看她012---Ross, why don't you come on in.
你还好吗  我没事012---Well, how you doing? I'm okay.
那么糟吗   什么012---Ooh, that bad, huh?  What?
我可以感受到女性挫折与无助的时刻012---Look, I can sense when women are depressed and vulnerable.
这是我的天赋之一012---It's one of my gifts. Sit.
乔伊  当我看到他跟她下机的那一刻…012---Ugh, Joey, when I saw him get off that plane with her...
我真的以为我已经沉到谷底了012---...I really thought I just hit rock bottom.
可是今天的感觉就像是有个谷底…012---But today, it's like there's rock bottom...
然后下面还有50英尺的垃圾…012---...50 feet of crap...
然后才是我012---...then me.
把你的感觉告诉罗斯012---You gotta tell Ross how you feel.
我怎么能去对他说  那茱莉怎么办012---Oh, come on, how can I just tell him? What about Julie?
她怎样  他们才在一起两星期012---What about her? They've only been going out for two weeks.
罗斯已经爱你快十年了012---Ross has been in love with you for 10 years.
我不知道  我不知道  瑞秋012---I don't know. I don't know. Look, Rach, Rach.
我有跟一些女性友人相处过012---I've been with my share of women.
其实我有跟很多  别人的女性友人相处过012---I've been with a lot of people's share of women.
关键在于…012---But the point is...
罗斯对你的感情是我不曾感受过的012---...I've never felt about anyone the way Ross felt about you.
真的012---Really?
喂  同志012---Yo, paisan.
我可以跟你谈一下吗012---Can I talk to you for a sec?
你的裁缝师…012---Your tailor...
是一个很坏的人012---...is a very bad man!
法兰克  你在说什么啊012---Frankie? What are you talking about?
嘿   怎么了012---Hey, what's going on?
乔伊的裁缝师…012---Joey's tailor...
占我便宜012---...took advantage of me.
什么  不可能012---What? No way.
我找他好多年了012---I've been going to the guy for 12 years.
他说他要量我的内侧长度012---Oh, come on. He said he was gonna do my inseam.
然后他就沿着我的腿往上摸  然后就很明显的…012---Then he ran his hand up my leg and then there was definite...
什么012---What?
捧来捧去的012---Cupping.
他们量尺寸都是这样012---That's how they do pants!
首先  会先从一边摸上去  然后会推到另一边去012---First they go up one side, they move it over.
然后  再从另一边上来 再推回去  然后再量后面012---Then they go up the other side, move it back, then they do the rear.
干嘛  罗斯  告诉他  裁缝师不都是这样量长裤的吗012---What? Ross, tell him. Isn't that how a tailor measures pants?
对  是这样没错 那是在牢里才这样量！012---Yes, yes, it is. In prison!
你有毛病啊012---What's the matter with you?
干嘛啦012---What?
不是那样子的吗012---That's not?
哦  我的天012---Oh, my God.
即使是玛丽·泰勒·摩尔的发型  都比我好看012---Even Mary Tyler Moore would've been better.
我喜欢这发型012---I like it.
真的  我觉得这是〝十全十美〞012---Yeah, I do. I think it's a 10!
谢谢你012---Thank you.
我的头发很有趣味性012---My hair is very amused.
得了  这也不是最惨的事012---Oh, come on, things could be worse. I mean, uh...
你又没被〝卡在月亮与纽约市之间〞012---You could "get caught between the moon and New York City.
我知道〝很疯狂  不过那是真的〞012---I know it's crazy, but it's true."
真多谢012---Thank you.
嗯  我得走了  再见  待会儿见012---Well, I gotta go. Bye. See you.
再见  瑞秋  等等  你要走了012---Bye, Rach!  Wait, are you leaving?
我说〝再见〞就是这个意思012---That's what I meant by "bye."
我可以跟你谈一下下吗  好012---Well, uh, can I talk to you for a sec?  Okay.
医生做疝气检查的时候…012---When the doctor does that hernia test...
