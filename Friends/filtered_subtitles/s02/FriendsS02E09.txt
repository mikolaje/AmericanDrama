如果那是槲寄生  我可以吻你012---If it was mistletoe, I was gonna kiss you.
不  那是罗勒012---No, it's still basil.
好吧012---Okay.
你跑到哪里了  信箱012---How far did you get?  Mailbox.
好吧  我们有进步了012---All right, we're getting closer.  Uh-huh.
菲比  到底发生了什么事012---What's going on?
这真的是一团糟012---It's just, like, a whole mess of stuff.
昨天我爸是著名的缅甸树医生012---Like yesterday, my dad was this famous Burma tree-surgeon guy.
现在他是药剂师012---And, you know, now he's, uh, a pharmacist guy and...
或许他是很酷的药剂师012---Well, maybe he's this really cool pharmacist guy.
或许是啊  我要去敲门012---Yeah, maybe. And I'll knock on the door...
他会拥抱我  我就有爸爸了012---...and he'll hug me, and I'll have a dad.
我会去他的药房  大家都会对我好012---I'll go to his pharmacy and everyone will be nice to me...
因为我是法兰克的女儿012---...because, you know, I'm Frank's daughter.
那为什么你不去敲门呢012---So why not go knock?
因为如果他不是个好爸爸呢012---Because, I mean, what if he's not this great dad guy?
如果他还是那个抛弃我妈跟我们的混蛋呢012---What if he's still the dirtbag who ran out on my mom and us?
对012---Yeah.Hmm.
你们知道吗012---You know what?
这星期我已经失去一个假爸爸012---I've already lost a fake dad this week.
我想我还没准备好要失去真爸爸012---I don't think I'm ready to lose a real one.
菲比  没关系的  今天你跨出一大步012---Pheebs, that's okay. You took a big step today.
是吗  对012---Yeah? Yeah.
有一天当你准备好后  你会跨过灌木丛012---Someday, when you're ready, you'll make it past the hedges.
那个时候他会有幸得到你012---And when you do, he'll be lucky to have you.
你们太棒了012---You guys.
抱歉你们来不及去买东西了012---Sorry about your shopping.
没关系  我们会想出办法的012---CHANDLER: Oh, that's okay. We'll figure something out.
我知道你不打算进去012---I know you're not going in there...
你觉得我能去跟他借厕所吗012---...but do you think it'd be all right if I went in and used his bathroom?
没关系  算了012---That's fine, never mind.
很酷  下雪了012---Cool, snow!
就跟一大张画布一样012---Kind of like a blank canvas.
天啊  真的好热012---Ho-ho-ho-holy crap, is it hot in here!
我可以关掉暖气吗012---You mind if I turn the heat down?
我们该早点想到那一点的012---We could have used that kind of thinking earlier!
菲比  怎么样012---So, Pheebs, how did it go?
我没办法进去012---Oh, ahem, I couldn't go in.
甜心  我很遗憾  你还好吧012---Honey, I'm sorry.  Are you okay?
没事  因为我知道他在那里012---Yeah, it's okay, because I know he's there.
现在那就够了012---So that's enough for now.
已经过了午夜  祝大家圣诞快乐012---Hey, it's after midnight! Merry Christmas, everyone!
对  圣诞快乐012---Oh, right! Merry Christmas!
嘿  摩妮卡  开关坏了012---The knob was broken...
我就从下面把暖气整个关掉  希望你不介意012---...so I turned it off from underneath. I hope that's all right.
瑞秋  这是给你的012---Rach, these are for you.
雨刷012---Wiper blades.
可是我没车012---I don't even have a car.
没错  有了这个新汽车芳香剂  你会以为你有012---Ha, ha. No, but with this new-car smell, you'll think you do.
好吧  菲比  轮到你了012---Okay, Pheebs, your turn.
马桶座垫纸012---Toilet-seat covers.
你们趁我去加油时买的吗012---Is that what you were doing while I was getting gas?

这太多了  我觉得我该再送你一件毛衣012---Well, this is too much. I feel like I should get you another sweater.
还有一个很有价值的…012---And last but not least...
在亲热时给你最佳保护012---They're ribbed for your pleasure.
