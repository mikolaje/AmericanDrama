不是的…012---Oh, no, no, no.
他付钱给那女人因为她是职业歌手012---I meant, he's paying that other woman because she's a professional.

我这个博士哥哥想知道…012---My brother, the Ph.D., would like to know...
这个药有没有可能用口服的012---...if there's any way to treat this orally?
不行012---No.
在这种情况之下  打针是避免不了的  而且要马上打针012---Under these circumstances, it has to be an injection, and it has to be now.
怎么样012---So?
噢012---Oh.
坐下来  医生说这一针非打不可012---Go and have a seat. Um, the doctor says it's got to be a needle.

如果他们只养过健康宠物  八成完全听不懂012---I mean, if all you've ever actually had are healthy pets, then whoosh!
不光只是那样012---But it's not even that, you know?
我一向唱我写的歌  因为那让我很开心012---I used to do my songs because it made me happy.
可是现在却变成全都是为了钱012---Now it's just all about the money, you know?
店里有人想念你012---Well, people missed you in there.
事实上  还有人指名要听《臭猫》012---In fact, there was actually a request for "Smelly Cat."
真的吗  谁012---Really? From who?

你记得我把扫帚插进你的脚踏车轮…012---Remember when I stuck that broom in your spokes...
结果你翻车头撞到路边那次吗012---...and you hit your head on the curb?
不记得012---No.
不过 我记得是别人老告诉我那件事012---But I remember people telling me about it.
噢012---Oh.
