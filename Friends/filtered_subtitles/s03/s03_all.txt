这些是我仅有属于他的东西012---This is all I have left of him.
恶心的…012---Gross...
排水管的头发012---...drain hair.
真好玩  好像有一个小人在你的麦片里淹死了012---Cool! Oh, it looks like a tiny little person drowning in your cereal.

你跟他分手是有原因的012---You broke up with him for a reason.
我知道…我只是不想再这么想他012---I know. I know.I'm just so tired of missing him.
不愿再去想  他为何不打来  他为何都没打来012---Tired of wondering why he hasn't called. Why hasn't he?

我们总是一起去的  我们是冰球三兄弟啊012---We always go together. We're like The Three Hockey-teers, you know?
也许是我误会你了  你是否反感珍妮丝012---I may be way out on a limb here,but do you have a problem with Janice?
没有012---No!
对啦…012---Yes...
天啊  我该怎么说012---Oh, God, how do I say this? Uh...
你知道希腊餐厅里那个头发很蓬的女孩子012---You know that girl from there staurant with the hair?
那个我很讨厌的女孩子  她快把我逼疯了012---Ooh! That girl that I hate? Ugh! She drives me crazy. Ew.

你终于说出来了012---Well, there you go. Oh.

别担心  我语法没错012---Don't worry, those are the right letters.
你到底要我说什么012---Look, what do you want me to say?
我要你说你喜欢她012---I want you to say that you like her!
我说不出来  这像是一种化学作用012---I can't. It's like this chemical thing,you know?
每次她一开始笑  我就想…012---Every time she starts laughing,I just wanna...
想把我的手臂拔下来  我就能往她身上砸012---...pull my arm off so I have something to throw at her.
谢谢你的努力012---Thanks for trying.
对了  根本就没有罗斯摩尔伯爵012---Oh, and by the way,there is no Count Rush more!
那是谁在罗斯摩尔山上塑了那些总统肖像012---Then who's the guy that painted the faces on the mountain?
你怎么可以告诉她012---Ugh.How could you tell her?
我想又没什么大不了的012---I didn't think it would be that big a deal!
她认为没什么大不了的012---Oh. She didn't think it would be a big deal!
你在跟谁讲话012---Who are you talking to when you do that?
这些应该是我们之间很私密的对话012---Look, that was supposed to bea private, personal thing between us.
菲比是我的闺密  好吗  我们无话不谈的012---Phoebe is my girlfriend, okay? We tell each other everything.
男人也一样啊012---Guys do the same thing.
我是说  那些更衣室里的谈话呢012---I mean, what about all that locker-room stuff?
那不一样  我们会谈像是谁跟脱衣舞娘约会012---That's different.That's like, uh, who dated a stripper?
或谁在史坦登岛渡轮后面做爱012---Or who did it on the back of the Staten Island ferry?
这两个都是乔伊吧  是啊012---Both of those Joey? Yeah.
但我们不谈自己的女友…012---But you don't talk about your girlfriend...
还有和女友之间做的亲密的事012---...and the intimate stuff you do with her.
连最好的朋友也不谈  不啊012---Not even with your best friend? No.
真可悲啊012---That is so sad.
你们错过太多乐趣了012---You're missing out on so much.
那是种交心与分享的感觉…012---I mean, the bonding and the sharing...
并知道他们也和你经历过一样的事012---...and knowing they're going through the same thing you are.
那你们什么都跟对方说吗012---Oh. So, what, you tell each other everything?
差不多啊012---Pretty much.
你们有没有谈过那次一夜五次的事012---Did you talk aboutthe Night of Five Times?

还有低声轻语的小溪产生平静的音律012---...and the calming sounds of the babbling brook.
好  一点用也没有012---Okay, this isn't working. Oh.
我还是醒着的  而且我得去上厕所012---I'm still awake,and now I have to pee.
我听说…012---So I hear...
你讨厌我012---...you hate me!
我没说我讨厌你  我可是很小心的012---I, uh, never said hate.I was very careful about that.
有人私下告诉我你想扯下手臂  丢到我身上012---A little birdie told me you wanting to rip your arm off and throw it at me.
这样你就觉得我讨厌你  你也太断章取义了吧012---And you got "hate" from that? You're taking a big leap there, I, uh...
好吧012---All right, fine, fine, fine!
这种情形  我们得想点策略012---We have got to do something about our little situation here.

是  我知道我睡在你们的隔壁012---Yeah, I know. Ha.I sleep in the next room.
我今天去了邮局012---I went down to the post office...
寄来的是我订的录影带012---...and it turns out it was those videos that I ordered...

正在亲热…012---...and, uh, ahem, you know,you're fooling around...
脑袋里突然出现一些疯狂的念头012---...and you get all these mental images in your brain?

穿了肚脐环的那个  我就知道012---With the belly button ring? Oh. Oh! I know.
但是突然之间你忽然想到你妈012---And then all of a sudden, your mom pops into your head.
然后你就想〝妈  快走开啦〞012---And you're, like,"Mom, get out of here!"
当然  这之后你就完全没情绪再想其他人了012---But after that,you can't think of anything else.
而你正在做的事又不能停止  所以你就好像…012---And you can't stop what you're doing.So it's kind of like you're...
你知道…012---...you know, you know...
你不知道012---You don't know!
你妈妈012---Your mom?
你是说跟你妈一起  你究竟有什么毛病012---You're telling me about your mom? What's the matter with you?
你说… 我说要〝分享〞 不是〝吓唬人〞012---You said...I said "share," not "scare"!
你给我坐到那边去012---Go sit over there!

还是谢谢你的努力012---I appreciate you giving it a shot.
但是有一点可喜的是…012---But you know, the good thing...
我们整天在一起而我还能存活012---...is that we spent the whole day together and I survived.
更了不起的是  她也做到了012---And what's even more amazing,so did she. Ha, ha.
今天是《大都会》主场的球棒日012---It was Bat Day at Shea Stadium.
我想这还了不起的012---I guess that's something.

现在我知道我可以待在她旁边  表示…012---Now I know I can stand to bearound her. Which means...

比他跟芭芭拉分手时还糟012---Worse than when he broke up with Barbara.
你不是故意这么说的吧  那个男人简直一团糟012---You're not just saying that, are you? No, the man is a mess!
他有没有哭  没有012---Was he crying? No.

好  我们有19分钟  钱德  我要你去换衣服012---Okay, we have 19 minutes. I want you to go and change.
等你回来后  乔伊去换衣服  他就会把椅子空出来012---When you come back, Joey will go change, and he'll have vacated the chair.

坐在椅子上的那个人012---...who's sitting in a chair!

我沾到鹰嘴豆酱了012---I got the hummus.
甜心  我们会找出衣服给你  你要不要穿我的黑外套012---Oh, honey, we'll find you something. You wanna wear my black jacket?
这样跟洋装就不能搭配了  没错012---It won't go with this dress. You're right.
来吧  我们把衣服换掉  不…别换掉012---Well, let's just get you out of that. No, no, no. Not out of that.
千万别把衣服脱掉  菲比  可以穿你的绿洋装吗012---Not out of clothes. Can Phoebe borrow your green dress?
我打给他了012---I called him.
对  电话进到他的答录机  然后我留言了012---Yes. I got his machine and I left a message.
不过没关系…012---But it's okay. It's okay...
因为那是个闲聊式的  轻松的留言012---...because it was, like, a casual, breezy message.
很轻松012---It was breezy.
天啊  若听起来并不轻松该怎么办012---Oh, God, what if it wasn't breezy?
怎么可能不轻松  不会  这里是个轻松的地方012---How could it not be breezy? No, because you're in such a breezy place.
我知道了  我播出我的留言  你们再告诉我是否轻松012---I got it. I'll play my message, and you guys tell me if it's breezy enough.
你怎么可能那样做012---But how you gonna do that?
我知道他答录机的密码012---I know the code to his answering machine.
好  摩妮卡  我不认为现在应该…012---Okay, Mon, I really don't think this is the...

〝你有两个新讯息〞012---"You have two new messages."
〝请把派递给我〞012---Please pass the pie.
我是摩妮卡  我只是想确定一下012---Hi, it's Monica. I'm just checking in.
我有一通留言  不知道是新的还是旧的012---I got a message and didn't know if it was old or new...
所以  我只是问问看012---...so I'm just checking.
告诉我吧012---So let me know.
或者不告诉我  都可以012---Or don't. Whatever.
我很轻松012---I'm breezy!
你不能说〝我很轻松〞  这样就不轻松了012---You can't say you're "breezy." That negates the "breezy."
你好啊  是我  昨天真的很开心012---Hola. It's me. Yesterday was really fun.
打给我  我们来聊聊周末的计划  好吗012---Call me about this weekend, okay?
看  她听起来就很轻松012---Now, she sounded breezy.
他开始约会了  我真不敢相信他开始约会012---He's seeing someone. I can't believe he's seeing someone.
你还不能那么肯定  那么  那是谁的声音012---You don't know that. Well, whose voice was that?
说不定是他妹妹的  说不定是他女儿的012---Maybe it was his sister's. Maybe it was his daughter's.
蜜雪儿  一定是了  听起来像蜜雪儿吗012---Michelle. Of course! Did it sound like Michelle?
太好了  开始下雨了  这样计程车更难叫到了012---Oh, great. It's starting to rain. That'll make it easier to get a cab.
是蜜雪儿012---It was Michelle.
绝对是蜜雪儿012---It was definitely Michelle.
去试穿摩妮卡的绿洋装  不适合就穿我的灰色丝质洋装012---Try Monica's green dress. If it doesn't fit, wear my gray silk one.
那我要穿哪件  你还不知道自己要穿什么012---Unless I wear it. You don't know what you're wearing?
今晚是你的大日子  我只是希望自己好看一点012---I'm just trying to look nice for your big night.
是啊  而我们在12分钟内必须出门012---Yeah, which we have to leave for in 12 minutes.
来吧  我帮你选衣服012---Come on, I'll just pick something out for you.
你看到了  我全换好了012---You'll notice that I'm fully dressed.
而我呢  也发现你什么都还没换012---I, in turn, have noticed that you are not.
所以  引用艾伦米恩的话〝离开我的椅子 驴蛋〞012---So in the words of A.A. Milne, "Get out of my chair, dill-hole."
好吧012---Okay.
你在干什么  你叫我离开椅子啊012---What are you doing? You said to give you the chair.
你又没说不能带走椅垫012---You didn't say anything about cushions.
但椅垫是椅子的重点012---They're the essence of the chair!
没错  我要带走重点012---That's right! I'm taking the essence.
他会回来的012---Oh, he'll be back.
这里什么人也没有012---Oh, there's nobody in the room.
对不起  我觉得这样很美  这是万圣节服装012---I'm sorry, I thought it looked pretty. That was a Halloween costume.
除非你要我穿的像小牧羊女一样012---Unless you would like me to go as Little Bo Peep.
如果没有那只可充气的羊  我还真认不出来012---I didn't recognize it without that inflatable sheep.
是啊  对了  钱德  记得还给我012---Yeah, which, by the way, Chandler, I would like back one of these days.
瑞秋  很好啊  这件是不是很适合我012---Rach, good! Listen, isn't this perfect for me?
太棒了  但是不适合今晚012---Oh, it's perfect! But not for tonight.
当然不适合今晚  这像是去慈善晚会的装束012---Of course not for tonight. Hi. I'm going to a benefit.
不适合今晚  那你穿它干嘛012---Not for tonight? What are you doing?
对不起  他没别的意思  我爱你…深呼吸012---No, I'm sorry. We didn't mean it. I love you. Breathe.
我们去露营时  把它们当枕头012---We used them as pillows when we went camping.

你的闲暇时间在干嘛…012---Hey, what you do on your own time...
我的内裤呢012---Where's my underwear? Whoa, whoa, whoa.
拜托  你拿了他的内裤  他拿走我的重点啊012---Come on, you took his underwear? He took my essence!
好  等等  你干嘛不穿你身上的内裤012---Okay, hold on. Why can't you just wear the underwear you're wearing now?
因为我现在根本没有穿内裤012---Because I'm not wearing any underwear now.
那你今晚为何要穿内裤012---Then why do you have to wear underwear tonight?
因为这燕尾服是租的012---It's a rented tux, okay?
我不想没穿内裤就穿别人的衣服012---I'm not gonna go "commando" in another man's fatigues.
那有人就得把椅垫还给别人012---Then somebody's gonna have to give somebody back his cushions.
好  你把我衣服藏起来  我要做一件完全相反的事012---Okay. You hide my clothes. I'm gonna do the exact opposite to you.
什么  难道你要给我看我的衣服吗012---What, are you gonna show me my clothes?
嘿  相反的…012---Hey, opposite...
就是相反的事012---...is opposite.
他什么都没有012---He's got nothing!
好  我准备好了012---Okay, I'm ready.
瑞秋那里没有我喜欢的  除了这个圣诞彩带012---Rachel didn't have anything I liked but this ribbon.
我想  好吧  那我就政治化一点吧012---I thought, all right, I'll be political.
那你在支持什么  当然是圣诞节012---What are you supporting?  Christmas.
我无所谓  已经搞定两个了  我还有整整12分钟012---Hey, that's okay with me. Two down, and I have exactly 12 minutes...

我的表停了  我的表  你看…012---My watch stopped. My watch. Okay, see...

现在几点  已经7点33分  我还有7分钟012---What time is it? It's 7:33. I have 7 minutes.
我还有7分钟012---I have seven minutes!
我该穿哪一双鞋  黑色的还是紫色的012---Which shoes should I wear? The black or the purple?
随便挑一双  好吗  好啦  黑色的012---Just pick one, okay? Oh, okay, okay. The black.
你有没有黑色带细带子的012---Do you have black with little strappies?
有  不过那种适合配裤子  或者我该穿裤子012---Yeah, but those go better with pants. Maybe I should wear pants.
对了  穿裤子是好主意  或者不要穿裤子更好012---Yeah, pants! What an idea! Or better yet, go without pants.
我不知道你在做什么  但是你快进去…012---I don't know what you're doing but just get in there...
找出随便一双可以穿的鞋子012---...and pick out any shoes that fit your feet.
我不管它是否搭配  我不管它是否会…012---I don't care if they match. I don't care if they make...
让你的脚踝  膝盖或耳垂看起来胖胖的  快去吧012---...your ankles or your knees or your earlobes look fat. Just do it!
进房间  挑出要穿的  然后我们就可以走了012---Go in there, pick something out so we can go.
好吧  谢谢012---All right. Thank you.
我要打给蜜雪儿  确定那是她的声音012---I've got to call Michelle to see if that was her voice.
没错  那就是她的声音012---It was. It was her voice.
摩妮卡  我想你又开始偏执了012---Monica, I think you've gone over to the bad place.

你知道奇怪的是什么012---You know what's weird?
唐老鸭从来不穿裤子012---Donald Duck never wore pants.
但是当他洗完澡出来…012---But when he gets out of the shower...
他总是在腰间围上一条毛巾012---...he always puts a towel around his waist.
我是说  那算什么012---I mean, what is that about?
蜜雪儿  我只是进入信箱  来听我自己的留官012---I only beeped in so I could hear my own message.
那样说得过去吧012---I mean, that's allowed.
我真的希望你别告诉你爸…012---I would really appreciate it if you wouldn't tell your dad about...
你说你不爽是什么意思  我们是朋友啊012---What do you mean, you don't feel comfortable with this? We're friends!

她房间里有电话吧  好  我们来处理吧012---She's got a phone in there, right? Okay, we're on it.
我知道单子上写〝打不打领带都没关系〞012---I know it says, "black tie optional"...
但你这样好像过于随便了012---...but this may be pushing it a little.
我不去了012---I'm not gonna go.
你不去了012---You're not gonna go?
不  我想更新我的通讯录012---No, I think I'm gonna catch up on my correspondence.
你怎么可以不去呢012---How can you not be going?
我就是不去了012---I'm not gonna go.
我想这样就表明了〝我不去〞的意思012---So I think that will accomplish the "not going."
我只是好奇…012---Um, you know, just out of curiosity...
自从你在我朋友面前羞辱我  又对我大吼012---Ever since I was humiliated and yelled at in front of my friends...
我就没有情绪去参加什么博物馆的慈善会了012---...I'm just, I don't know, not in a very museum benefit-y kind of mood.
好…天啊  很抱歉  我对你大吼大叫  对不起012---Right. Well, okay. Okay. God, I'm sorry. I'm sorry I yelled.
没关系  可是你在生气012---That's fine. No, but you're mad.
我没有生气  我只是不去了012---I'm not mad. I'm just not going.
没错  好吧012---Right. Okay.
你知道我一定要去吧012---You know that I have to go, right? Mm-hm.
那这样会不会变成  我在你难过时离你而去012---So is it gonna be like I'm abandoning you while you're upset?
不  不012---No. No?
我对你大吼  你不难过 对  还包括你的羞辱012---You're not upset about the yelling. Right. And the humiliating.
当然  还有羞辱012---Well, of course, the humiliating.
那么012---So we...
我们之间没问题012---...we're okay?
我们没问题  对012---We're good.  Right.
亲爱的  我爱你  是的  罗斯012---Honey? I love you. Yes, Ross.
把电话放下012---Get away from that phone!
她已经开始换衣服了012---She's just getting dressed now.
我居然因此而兴奋  我是不是有问题012---Is it wrong that I was totally aroused by that?
好啦  兄弟  就是这样啦012---Okay, buddy boy, here it is.
你把我衣服藏起来  我就把你所有的衣服穿上012---You hide my clothes. I'm wearing everything you own.
天啊012---Oh, my God!
这算什么与藏人家内裤相反的事012---That is so not the opposite of taking somebody's underwear!
你看看我  我是钱德012---Look at me! I'm Chandler.
我还能再多穿一件衣服吗012---Could I be wearing any more clothes?
或许我不该不穿内裤的…012---Maybe if I wasn't going commando...
穿这么多真是热死我了012---It's hot with all this stuff on.
我最好别再做运动…像是跨步之类的012---I better not do any, I don't know, lunges.
够了  别再跨步了012---Okay, enough. Enough with the lunging.
我快被烦死了  我真的已经受够了012---I'm sick of this. I've had it up to here.
你们两个都不准参加晚会012---Neither of you can come to the party!
天啊  真幼稚012---Jeez, what a baby!
你干嘛破坏一切  我正要去换衣服了012---Way to ruin it. I was just gonna go get dressed.
那个唯一我会在乎是否换好衣服的人…012---The only person I cared about getting dressed...
却是那个不肯去的人012---...is the person who's not even gonna go.
瑞秋  我很抱歉  好吗012---Look, Rach, I'm sorry, okay?
我真是个混球  抱歉对你大吼  我希望你能去012---Look, I was a jerk, okay? I'm sorry I yelled. I want you there.
我需要你去012---I need you there.
要怎样做才能证明我有多希望你去012---What can I do to show you how much I want you to be there?
你可以把那杯脂肪喝掉012---You could drink the fat.
欢迎你进入大人的谈话世界012---Welcome to an adult conversation.
不  等一下…012---No, no, no. Now wait a minute. Wait a minute.
这听起来还蛮有意思的  什么012---That actually sounds interesting. What?
我想你应该把那杯脂肪喝掉012---I think you should drink the fat.
好  若这样就能证明你对我有多重要…012---Okay, if that's what it takes to show you how much you mean to me...
以及我多希望你能去  那我就愿意去做012---...and how much I want you there, that's what I'll do.
我帮你换一个杯子  这一杯放好久了012---Let me get you another glass. That's been sitting out.
我想这样可以了012---I think this will be fine.
好吧  香草奶昔  只不过是香草奶昔…012---Okay, vanilla milkshake. Just a vanilla milkshake...
只不过有鸡肉的碎屑浮着012---...with chicken bits floating in it.
干杯012---Cheers.
不  不要  好吧  我去就是了…012---No, don't! Okay, okay, I'll go. I'll go.
你肯去012---You will?
你真的会那么做  对吧  是啊012---You were really gonna do that?  Well, yeah.
你真的愿意喝下脂肪012---You were gonna drink the fat.
我们来看看他还能做什么012---Let's see what else he'll do!
不如你现在去换衣服  你把他的内裤还给他012---How about you get changed? Give him his underwear.
我来叫计程车  我要大家在两分钟内下楼012---I'll get a cab. I want everyone downstairs in two minutes.
摩妮卡012---Monica!
别做了012---Stop it.
别再做了012---Stop it!
罗斯去叫计程车了那  我们…012---Ross went to get a cab so we...
别  摩妮卡  你在干什么012---What are you doing? No, Monica, no!
我是理查012---Hi, this is Richard.
你有三个新讯息012---You have three new messages.
再也没有了012---Not anymore.
讯息已删除012---Message erased.
请在哔声后留言012---To record your message, begin speaking at the tone.
你好  理查  我是摩妮卡012---Hi, Richard. It's Monica.
我今晚做了一件很疯狂的事012---Listen, I did something kind of crazy tonight.
或许我大姨妈快来了  我也不知道怎么回事012---Maybe I'm getting my period or something. I don't know.
反正我进入你的答录机  然后听到一个留言…012---Anyway, I beeped into your machine and I heard this message...
快把我搞疯了012---...that freaked me out...
其他的蜜雪儿会告诉你012---...and Michelle will tell you the rest.
我很抱歉  我希望  我们会忘了这整件事012---I'm sorry, okay? And I hope that we can just forget the whole thing.
你的主人留言已经更改012---Your outgoing message has now been changed.
主人留言012---Outgoing?
它刚刚是说主人留言012---Did that say outgoing?
别是主人留言012---Not outgoing!
你好  理查  我是摩妮卡012---Hi, Richard, it's Monica.
我今晚做了一件疯狂的事012---Listen, I did something kind of crazy tonight.
或许我大姨妈快来了  我也不知道怎么回事012---Maybe I'm getting my period or something. I don't know.
你是怎么做的  我不知道012---How did you do that?  I don't know!
再见  不012---Goodbye. No!
好  我叫到两辆计程车  但没人下来  走吧  走吧012---Okay, I've got two cabs and no people! Go, go, go!
或许我们可以打给电话公司  也许可以改掉那个留言012---Maybe we can call the phone company to change the message?
也许可以把他的电话号码改掉012---They could change his number.
我想经过这件事  他会自己处理了012---I think after this, he'll be doing that himself.
瑞秋012---Rachel!
你看起来…012---You... You look...
而我还剩下5秒钟012---And I still have about five seconds to spare.
这样大概花掉7秒钟012---That was about 7 seconds.
所以我们迟了一点012---So we're a little late.
走吧012---Come on.
而且…012---Oh, and by the way...
什么事012---What?
我下面也是真空012---I'm going commando too.
盖勒博士012---Dr. Geller?
我是伦敦学院来的雪曼惠菲   很荣幸见到你012---Sherman Whitfield, London Institute. What a pleasure.
你的前白垩纪化石报告写得真赞012---I was quite impressed with your paper on pre-Cretaceous fossils.
是的  你再次验证了我以前写的东西012---Yes, it confirmed everything I'd written.
对不起012---Excuse me.
你好012---Hi.
什么事012---Yes?
你好像坐在我的位子上012---You're kind of sitting in my seat.
什么意思  你的位子012---What do you mean, your seat?
我是说  我本来坐在这里  但是你离开了012---I mean, I was sitting there. But you got up.
可是我没有离开这个房间012---But I never left the room.
但是你离开椅子区域了012---But you left the chair area.
好吧  这样吧  把你的内裤给我012---All right, that's it. Give me your underwear.
乔伊  这就是你父母叫你不要在床上跳的原因012---See, Joe, that's why your parents told you not to jump on the bed.
《老友记》  第三季  第3集 爱果酱的人012---Friends S03E03  The One with the Jam
看看我  我在做果酱012---Hey, look at me. I'm making jam.
我早上四点就起来了  那么早你怎么可能买得到水果012---I've been at it since 4:00 this morning.  Where'd you get fruit at 4 in the morning?
在码头那边买的012---Went down at the docks.
你一定不知道能买到批发价012---Bet you didn't know you can get it wholesale.
我根本不知道有码头012---I didn't know there were docks.
嘿  嘿012---Hey.
你手断了吗012---Aw, is it broken?  Aw.
不  但得挂着这东西几个星期012---No, but I gotta wear this thing for a couple weeks.
你有没有告诉医生  你是因为在床上跳才受伤012---Did you tell the doctor you did it jumping up and down on your bed?
不  我编的故事本来行得通的  但是…012---No. I had a whole story worked out, but then...
钱德出卖了我012---...Chandler sold me out.
抱歉  乔伊012---I'm sorry, Joe.
我想医生不会相信你说的手臂自己断了012---I didn't think the doctor was gonna buy that it just fell out of his socket.
这是什么  水果吗012---What is this? Fruit?
摩妮卡在做果酱012---Monica's making jam.
我最爱果酱了  我们家怎么从来没有果酱012---Jam? I love jam. Hey, how come we never have jam at our place?
因为孩子们需要买新鞋012---Because the kids need new shoes.
我得做正事了  我不想再为理查的事烦心012---I'm going into business, people. I'm sick of being depressed about Richard.
我需要一个计划  来忘记我的男人012---I needed a plan. A plan to get over my man.
什么是男人的反义词   就是果酱012---What's the opposite of man? Jam.
乔伊  别动  太烫了012---Joey, don't. It's way too hot.
那么这就算我的了012---This will just be my batch.
到此止步  嘿  你这位穿名牌的…012---Um, that's it. No. Hey you. J. Crew guy...
你干嘛跟踪我012---Yeah. Why are you following me?
这一周来  我在哪里都能看到你012---All week long, everywhere I look, there's you.
你不回我电话  又把我的信退回来012---You wouldn't return my calls. You sent back my letters.
什么   再给我一次机会  乌苏拉012---What?  One more chance, Ursula. Please.
真是太尴尬了012---Oh. Well, this is awkward.
怎么了012---Why? - Um...
你要找的是乌苏拉  而我是菲比  我们是双胞胎姐妹012---Yeah, because you want Ursula, and I'm Phoebe. Twin sisters.
我认真的012---Seriously.
真不好意思  我跟错人了012---Oh. That's great. I'm stalking the wrong woman.
我真是个傻蛋012---I am such a dingus!
你不是傻蛋012---Oh, you're not a dingus.
我只想让你知道  我不是一直这样的012---I just... I want you to know I didn't used to be like this.
在认识你姐姐之前  我只是012---Before I met your sister, I was, like, this normal guy...
卖手机的普通人012---...who sold beepers and cellular phones.
听着  这不是你的错  知道吗012---Well... I mean, look, it's not your fault, you know?
只是她对待男人就是这个样子012---I mean, this is just what she does to guys, okay?
就是…012---Just...
谢谢012---Well, thanks.
等等  我有个小故事告诉你012---Wait. You know what? I got a little story.
我在念国中时012---When I was in junior high school...
有一阵子  我以为自己是女巫012---...I went through this period where I thought I was a witch.
有个辅导员老师跟我说了一段的话012---And there was this guidance counselor who said something to me...
我想可以帮助你012---...that I think will help you a lot.
他说〝你根本不是女巫  你只是个普通学生〞012---He said, "Okay, you're not a witch. You're just an average student."
你懂我的意思吗  不是很懂012---See what I'm saying?  Not really.
忘了这段感情吧012---Um, well, get over it.
你看起来是个好人012---I mean, you just... You seem like a really nice guy.
别太难为自己  好吗012---You know, I just... Don't be so hard on yourself, okay?
没错  你说得没错  谢谢你对我这么好012---Wait, you're right. I know you're right. And thanks for being so nice.
给你012---Here. - Aah!
谢谢你012---Thanks a lot.
你要不要去喝杯咖啡012---Do you wanna get a cup of coffee or...?
好啊  好012---Yeah, okay.  Okay.
你不用走在我后面了012---You don't have to walk behind me anymore.
抱歉012---Sorry.
摩妮卡  摩妮卡012---Mon?  Mon?
〝去多买些罐子  等一下回来  摩妮卡盖勒〞012---"Gone for more jars. Back later. Monica Geller."
等等  你看012---Wait a minute. Look.
看看… 怎么了…012---Look, look, look.  What, what, what?
整间公寓里都没人012---It's an empty apartment. - Mm.
这间空房里  只有我们两个012---We're all alone in an empty apartment.
我十分钟后得去上班012---Aw, honey, come on. I have to be at work in, like, 10 minutes and, oh...
好吧  我又不是模范员工012---All right. Well, it's not like I'm employee of the year or anything.
啊012---Ha, ha. Whoo!
在这里啊  这就是你要找的012---There it is. Oh. Oh, that's what you're talking about. Ahem.
嘿  嘿012---Hey.  Hey.
我看起来很胖吗012---Do I look fat?
不胖012---No.
这么说我可以接受012---Okay, I accept that.
当珍妮丝问我时  我回答不012---When Janice asked me and I said no...
她却认为我说她像母牛012---...she took that to mean that I was calling her a cow.
重头再说一次给我们听…012---Okay, walk us through it, honey. Walk us through it.
珍妮丝说…012---Okay, well, Janice said, uh:
〝我今天看起来胖吗  我看看她…012---"Hi. Do I look fat today?" And I looked at her...
你看看她012---You looked at her?
你绝不能看012---You never look.  Mm-mm.
你只能回答  就像条件反射 "我看起来胖吗" "不"012---You just answer. It's like a reflex. "Do I look fat?" "No."
"她比我漂亮吗" "不"012---"Is she prettier than I am?" "No."
"尺寸很重要吗  不012---"Does size matter?"  No.
这点男女都适用012---And it works both ways.
所以你们本来就知道这些012---Okay, so you both just know this stuff?
吵了大概三四十次架后 你大概就了解了012---You know, after about 30 or 40 fights, you kind of catch on.
例如012---Okay. For instance, ahem:
珍妮丝旅行回来  她给你两种选择012---Let's say Janice is coming back from a trip and she gives you two options.
选择一  她从机场自己搭计程车回来012---Option number one: She'll take a cab home from the airport.
选择二  你在领行李的地方与她碰面  你会怎么做012---Or option two: You can meet her at baggage claim. What do you do?
简单  领行李的地方  错了  这样你就没女朋友啦012---That's easy. Baggage claim. Ehh! Wrong. Now you're single.
其实是第三个秘密绝招012---It's actually secret option number three.
你在接机门与她碰面  这就表现出你对她的爱012---You meet her at the gate. That way she knows you love her.
好  这样真不错012---Hmm. Okay, this is good. This is good.
好  我有一个问题  珍妮丝喜欢抱抱…012---All right, listen, I have one. Janice likes to cuddle...
在晚上的时候  我当然也喜欢抱抱012---...at night, which I'm all for. - Mm.
不过当你想睡觉时  你会想要一点空间012---But, uh, you know, when you want to go to sleep, you want some space.
我要怎样告诉她  才不会…012---So, uh, you know, how do I tell her that without...
不小心又说她胖之类的012---...you know, accidentally calling her fat or something?
抱歉  我们帮不了你  因为我们都是抱着睡的012---Oh. Honey, I'm sorry. We can't help you there, because we're cuddly sleepers.
我上班要迟到了012---Okay, I'm late for work. Oh.
你们要不要下来   好  等一下就去012---Are you guys gonna come down? Uh, yeah. I'm right behind you.
祝你好运  钱德  谢了  瑞秋012---Good luck, Chandler. Thank you, Rachel.
再见  再见  宝贝  亲爱的012---Bye, sweetie. Bye, honey.
关于睡觉那件事012---Okay, the sleeping thing.
非常困难  但也不是没办法可想012---Very tricky business but there is something you can do.
我以为你们都是抱着睡觉  其实不是012---I thought you were cuddly sleepers. No.
不  不是抱着睡  不是我  只有她012---No, not cuddly. Not me. Just her.
我跟你一样  我需要空间012---I'm like you. I need the room. Ahem.
好  到这里来012---Okay, come here. Ahem.
好  现在你在床上012---Okay. You're in bed.
好吧012---Yeah?
我还是用靠垫好了  好吧012---I'm gonna use the cushion.  Yeah.
好  你在床上  她在你旁边  抱着你012---Okay. You're in bed. She's over on your side cuddling.
现在  你等她逐渐睡着…012---Now, you wait for her to drift off...
然后你抱住她…012---...and then you hug her...
然后把她滚到床的另一边012---...and roll her over to her side of the bed.
然后你…012---And then you...
你就滚到一边去012---...roll away.
抱住她012---Hug for her.
滚到一边去012---Roll for you.
就像以前的拥抱与翻滚   对012---Okay, the old "hug and roll." Yep.
只有一个问题  说吧012---Okay. One question.  Shoot.
你把枕头当作女生  对吧012---You're pretending the pillow's a girl, right?
记得小时候…012---Remember when you were a kid...
你妈会把你送到电影院…012---...and your mom would drop you off at the movies...
给你一罐果酱和一根小汤匙012---...with a jar ofjam and a little spoon?
你真可爱012---You're so pretty.
嘿  嘿  菲比012---Hi. Hey, Phoebe.
你知道那个跟踪我的人吗   我今天跟他说话了012---Hey, oh! You know that guy who's been following me? I talked to him today.
你跟他说话  你疯了吗012---[MUMBLING] You talked to him? Are you crazy?
第一  我没有疯  第二  用嘴来说  别乱喷012---Okay, first, I'm not crazy. And second, say it. Don't spray it.
反正他叫做麦肯  他也不是在跟踪我012---Anyway, his name is Malcolm, and he wasn't following me.
我是说  他在跟踪没错  但他以为我是乌苏拉012---I mean, he was, but just because he thought I was Ursula. Ick.
所以他不敢上前来跟我说话012---And that's why... That's why he couldn't just come up and talk to me.
因为有禁制令012---Because of the restraining order.
我还是对麦肯没有好感012---Hmm. Not feeling better about Malcolm.
不  他不是疯子012---Oh! No, no, no, he's not like a kook.
他只是个非常热情  极度浪漫的家伙…012---No, he's just this, like, very passionate, incredibly romantic guy...
只是有点过火了012---...that just got a teensy bit carried away, you know?
我们处得很好  而且他很可爱012---And we just get along really well, and he's so cute.
天啊  你竟然喜欢跟踪你姐姐的人012---Oh, my God. You've got a crush on your sister's stalker.
我要帮他忘记乌苏拉的一切012---No, I'm just gonna help him, you know, get "de-Ursula-ized."
就像乔伊跟她约会后我为他做的一样012---Like, you know... Like I did for Joey after he went out with her.
我没有跟踪她012---Yeah, but I didn't stalk her. I mean...
你是鸡同鸭讲012---I asked for the news, not the weather.
嘿  大伙儿  嘿  摩妮卡012---Hey, guys. Hey, Mon.
乔伊  这是你的  这是黑莓红醋粟酱012---Joey, this is for you. It's blackberry currant.
太美妙了012---Yeah.
乔伊  我得问你012---Hey, Joe, I gotta ask.
影印店的那个女孩  全裸012---The girl from the Xerox place, buck naked...
还是你要一大缸果酱012---...or a big tub of jam?
你把两只手放在一起好了012---Put your hands together.
你慢慢吃啊  那是最后一批012---Joey, take your time with that. That's my last batch.
没有果酱了012---No more jam?
你的果酱计划呢012---What happened to your jam plan?
我算过了  我每罐得卖17元才能打平012---Well, I figured out I'd need to charge 17 bucks a jar just to break even.
所以我有个新计划  就是生小孩012---So I've got a new plan now. Babies.
那你可能需要很大的罐子012---Well, you're gonna need much bigger jars.
你在讲什么   讲我要要生小孩的事012---What are you talking about? About me having a baby.
你是认真的吗  是的012---Are you serious? Yeah.
果酱计划让我开始掌握自己的生活012---The great thing about the jam plan was I was take control of my life.
所以我就想什么事对我最重要012---So I asked myself, "What is the most important thing to me?"
因此我就想出  生小孩这个计划012---And that's when I came up with the baby plan.
你是不是忘了什么012---Well, aren't you forgetting something?
那个家伙叫什么   叫〝爹地〞012---What is, uh...? What is that guy's name? Dad.
我花了28年  找到一个  想与他共度终身的男人012---It took me 28 years to find one man that I wanted to spend my life with.
如果我还得再等28年  我就得56岁才生小孩012---If I have to wait another 28 years, then I'll be 56 before I can have a baby.
那样实在太愚蠢了012---And that's just stupid.
那样叫愚蠢012---That's what's stupid?
我不需要一个真正的男人  只要他几只会游泳的小家伙012---I don't need an actual man. Just a couple of his best swimmers.
而且你可以在某个地方  弄到那些小家伙012---You know? And there are places that you can go to get that stuff.

那家伙迷恋你姐姐012---Pheebs, this guy has been obsessed with your sister...
天晓得到底有多久了012---...for God knows how long, okay?
他不可能就这样忘了她012---You don't just give up something like that.
他把他的夜视镜  和一切东西都交给我了012---Look, he gave me his night-vision goggles and everything.
一个有夜视镜的人说的话  你也敢信012---You're taking the word of a guy who has night-vision goggles?
他不再跟踪她了  你觉得他还在跟踪她吗012---What? He's not still following her. You think he's still following her?
快醒醒  感觉一下什么叫禁制令吧012---Pheebs, wake up and smell the restraining order.
你说我该怎么办012---What should I do?
若你真的很喜欢他  应该相信他才是012---I think that if you really like this guy, you should just trust him.
谢谢你  摩妮卡012---Thank you, Monica.

天啊  发生什么事012---Oh, my God. What happened?

我倒希望012---I wish.
他只是在试罗斯的那招  拥抱与翻滚012---No, you know, he was just trying Ross' "hug and roll" thing.
罗斯的什么012---Ross' what?
当他抱住你把你滚到旁边  再…012---You know, like, where he hugs you and then he kind of rolls you away, and...
我的天啊012---Oh, my God.
菲比  怎样012---Phoebe? Yes? Yes! Oh.
你在做什么012---What are you doing?
我只是在找我的…012---Oh, I was just here looking for my, um...
吃过的三明治  在这里012---My part of an old sandwich. Here it is! Oh!
你在跟踪我吗012---Were you following me?
也许012---Um, perhaps.
是的  我很抱歉012---Yes. Yes. I'm sorry.
我害怕你仍然迷恋我姐姐012---I'm sorry. I was just afraid that you were still hung up on my sister.
所以你在监视我012---So you spied on me.
我真不敢相信你不信任我012---I can't believe you don't trust me.
你知道什么   我的双胞胎姐姐正好经过012---Oh, well, what do you know? There goes my identical twin sister.
就这么走着 跟我长得一模一样012---Just walking along, looking like me.
这是个奇异的巧合 还是你早知道她会搭这班车012---What is this, just a freakish coincidence, or did you know that she takes this train?
对不起…012---I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
我试着停止  但我做不到012---I tried to stop, but I couldn't.
我真可悲012---I'm so pathetic.
不  不是你的错  我也有错012---No, no, it's not your fault. You know, it's partly my fault.
是我要你断然戒除这个毛病012---It's because I made you quit cold turkey.
这很难  你知道吗012---It's too hard, you know?
我不能再跟你约会了 因为你是…012---Okay, well, I mean, I can't date you anymore, because you're, you know:
哇012---Wow!
但我一定要帮你忘掉我姐姐012---But, um... But I will definitely, definitely help you get over my sister. Okay?
试着跟踪我一阵子  好吗012---Just stalk me for a while, huh?
我就暂时当你的戒乌苏拉贴片012---Yeah, and I'll be like an Ursula patch.
我不知道012---Uh-huh. I don't know.
你就…你看  我正在走路012---Yeah, just... Okay, look, I'm going.

是啊  我挑了一个男性 编号37135012---Oh, yeah. I picked a guy, 37135.
听起来不错012---He sounds nice.
的确  他有棕发和绿眼睛012---I'd say so. He's got brown hair and green eyes.
不是开玩笑吧012---No kidding? Hmm.
怎么了 我以为你会选金发的012---What?  I figured you'd have picked a blond guy.
真的吗  为什么012---Really? Why?
我总是想像你和…012---I don't know. I always pictured you ending up...
一个高大聪明的金发男子  叫…012---...with one of those tall, smart, blond guys, name like...
荷依012---...Hoyt.
荷依   这是个名字012---Hoyt? It's a name. Yeah.
我看到你在一间  很棒的有泳池的大房子012---I saw you in this... You know, this great house with a big pool.
他是游泳选手吗012---Yeah? Is he a swimmer? Ha.
他可是有那种身材的012---He's got the body for it. Ha, ha.
我喜欢012---I like that.
怎样   你们有这样的标语…012---Ha, ha. What?  You guys have one of those signs that says:
〝我们不在你的厕所游泳  所以别在我们的池子尿尿〞012---"We don't swim in your toilet, so don't pee in our pool."
我们才不会有那种标语  你会有的  那是我送的礼物012---We do not have one of those signs.Sure you do. It was a gift from me.
然后你会有三个很棒的孩子012---Oh! And you have three great kids.
两个女孩和一个男孩   没错012---Two girls and a boy?  Yeah!
他们戴着手臂浮圈012---And they wear those little water wings, you know...
绕着泳池边跑012---...and they're running around on the deck.
然后荷依用毛巾围住他们三个012---And then Hoyt wraps this big towel around all three of them.
没错012---Sure.
但是  你知道这样听起来也不错012---Uh, but, hey, you know, this way sounds good too.
是啊012---Yeah.
喔  摩妮卡012---Oh, Monica.
这家伙是太空人012---Wow, this guy's an astronaut?
这样虽然很棒…012---That would have been cool...
也不会维持多久012---...for, like, a day. Ah-ah!
我打电话给精子银行012---I called the sperm bank today.
我的小家伙 一点也没卖出去012---They haven't sold a single unit of Tribbiani.
没有人要我的产品012---Nobody wants my product.
我真是不了解012---I mean, I don't get it, you know?
我的意思是…012---I mean...
如果她们能亲眼见到我012---...maybe if they met me in person.

或许你们会希望我转过来  靠着我的背亲热012---Perhaps you would like me to turn like this so you can bunny-bump against my back?
嘿  嘿012---Hey.  Hey.
兄弟  怎么了  或许你能告诉我012---Hey, man. What's up?  Maybe you can tell me.
我的经纪人想知道  为什么今天我没有去试镜012---My agent would like to know why I didn't show up at my audition today...
数周以来她首度帮我找到的好机会  为什么你没把留言给我012---...the first good thing she gets me in weeks. How could you not give me the message?
我可以告诉你  我很享受罪恶感012---I'll tell you, I do enjoy guilt...
但那不是我干的012---...but it wasn't me.
对  就是他012---Yes, it was. It was him. Uh-huh.
好吧  是我干的012---Okay, it was me.
为什么会是你  这真的很疯狂012---How was it you?  Well, it was all so crazy, you know?
钱德躲在柜子里数到十  但他数到七的时候012---Chandler was in the closet counting to 10 and was up to seven...
我还没有找到地方躲012---...and I hadn't found a place to hide yet.
听着  我打算跟你说012---Look, I meant to tell you
我都写在手上  看吧  真的012---and I wrote it all down on my hand. See? All of it.
对  那的确是我的试镜  没错012---Yep, that's my audition.  Yeah.
看吧  这就是为什么  我会四处放便条纸012---See? Now, this is why I keep notepads everywhere.
对  所以我们不找你一起玩012---Yep. And that's why we don't invite you to play.
那有什么好难过的  你可以改个时间去试镜012---What is the great tragedy here? Get yourself another appointment.
伊斯特试过了  选角导演说我错失了机会012---Well, Estelle tried. The casting director told her I missed my chance.
那不公平012---Well, that is unfair.
我打电话跟她说那是我的错012---I'll call her. I'll tell her it was totally my fault.
你不能那么做  选角导演不跟朋友说话012---You can't. The casting director doesn't talk to friends.
她只跟经纪人谈  她一定过着悲惨的生活012---She only talks to agents.  What a sad little life she must lead.
好吧012---Okay. Ooh.
你在做什么  不  我知道012---What are you doing? What are you doing?  No, I know, I know. Ooh.

显然他没去试镜  你是跟我办公室的哪个人联络的012---Apparently, he missed his audition. Who did you speak to in my office?
伊斯特  我不知道该怎么处理她012---Estelle? I don't know what I'm gonna do with her.
就算你老公跑了  还烧掉房子  日子还是得过下去012---So your husband leaves and burns down the apartment. The world does not stop.
有人跟我一样害怕吗012---Is anybody else scared?
如果乔伊无法试镜  那都是伊斯特的错  我不在乎012---If Joey loses this audition, then that is it for Estelle. I don't care.
安妮  你太棒了 你何时能见他  我需要笔012---Annie, you are a doll. What time can you see him? I need a pen. Pen.

只是多了滑雪靴跟超酷的贝雷帽012---But with ski boots and a kicky beret.
对  真的很酷012---Yeah, it's cute.
为什么他要买洋娃娃012---Why does he have it again?
他买了洋娃娃  有什么大不了的012---So he's got a doll. So what?
除非你害怕他长大后会…012---Unless you're afraid he's gonna grow up to be...
加入演艺圈012---...in show business.
这跟他由两个女人抚养长大的事实  毫无关系吧012---This wouldn't have to do with the fact that he's being raised by two women?
你们知道吗  没关系  如果你们不反对洋娃娃  我也是012---You know what? It's fine. If you're okay with the Barbie thing, so am I.
把洋娃娃交给爸爸  洋娃娃给我  好吧  要不要…012---Give Daddy the Barbie. Give me the Barbie. Okay, how about...?

乔伊  乔伊  快接电话012---Joe. Joe. Answer the phone.
我只剩一只手  你得帮我服务  帮我拿毛衣过来012---I only got one arm. You should do stuff for me. Get me a sweater.
快点  是珍妮丝打来的012---Just do it. It's Janice.
我一接  今晚就得跟她见面012---And if I get it, I'm gonna have to see her tonight.
太棒了  今晚我得跟她见面012---Oh, that's great. I'm gonna have to see her tonight.
为什么你不想见珍妮丝012---Why don't you wanna see Janice?
昨天吃晚餐时  一上菜012---Last night at dinner, when the meals came...
她将她点的柠檬香鸡排  一半放进我盘子里  挖走我的番茄012---...she put half her chicken piccata on my plate and took all my tomatoes.
真的很糟糕  因为…012---And that's bad...
你讨厌柠檬香鸡排012---...because you hate chicken piccata?
不012---No.
你不想分享番茄  番茄对你来说很重要012---You didn't wanna share your tomatoes. Tomatoes are very important to you.
不是  是突然间我们变成这样的情侣012---All of a sudden, we were this couple.
我的脑海里警铃大响012---And this alarm started going off in my head.
快逃命  闪人了012---"Run for your life! Get out of the building!"
男人太难以置信了012---Ugh. Men are unbelievable.
你们到底是怎么了012---What is it with you people?
你们一有感觉就得逃跑012---The minute you feel something, you have to run away?
我知道  那…012---I know. That...
所以今晚我不想去  我担心我会说出蠢话012---That's why I don't wanna go tonight. I'm afraid I'm gonna say something stupid.
你是说男人会装出冷淡无情012---Oh. You mean that guy thing where you act mean and distant...
逼我们跟你们分手012---...until you get us to break up with you? Mm-hm.
你们都知道012---Hey, you know about that?
我怎么做  我要过这一关012---What do I do? I wanna get past this.
我不要害怕承诺012---I don't wanna be afraid of the commitment thing.
我要通过隧道  直奔另一头012---I wanna go through the tunnel to the other side.
在那里你不会害怕承诺012---Where there's no fear of commitment. Ah.
大家有…012---Do we have any...?
大家有点子吗012---Do we have any thoughts here?
我不曾通过隧道  因为…012---I've never been through the tunnel myself because...
因为车上只能有一个女孩012---...you're not allowed through with more than one girl in the car.
但我觉得这跟其他事一样  面对恐惧012---But it seems to me it's pretty much like anything else. Face your fear.
怕高的人就爬到大楼顶楼012---You have a fear of heights? Go to the top of the building.
怕虫子的人012---You're afraid of bugs.
去抓只虫子来012---Get a bug.
对吧012---Right?
以现在的情况  你害怕承诺012---You have a fear of commitment.
我建议你乖乖出现  成为史上最爱承诺的男人012---So I say you go in there and you be the most committed guy there ever was.
没错  那真的很有道理012---Amazingly, that makes sense.
你们真的那么想  对  冲啊  兄弟012---Do you think? Oh, yeah. Go for it, man.
从高处跳下012---Jump off the high dive.
盯着枪管  逆风尿尿012---Stare down the barrel of the gun. Pee into the wind.
乔伊  如果我得盯着枪管看012---Joe, if I'm staring down the barrel of a gun...
我会尿得到处都是012---...I'm gonna be pretty much peeing every which way.
是你今天早上的试镜结果012---Ooh, it's your audition from this morning.
我能打一下电话吗012---Can I use the phone?
当然  那是电话的功能  供紧急事件跟假经纪人使用012---Sure, that's what it's there for. Emergencies and, uh, pretend agents.
加油  宝贝012---Come on, baby. Come on.
嗨  我是菲比布非  请问哪位找012---[IN HIGH VOICE] Hi. I have Phoebe Buffay returning a page.
好的  她在车里  我帮你接过去012---Okay, well, she's in her car. I'll have to patch you through.
非常聪明012---Very nice touch.
好的  请说012---Okay, go ahead.
快说…快说012---Talk, talk, talk.  Oh, oh. Um... Ahem.
嗨  安妮012---Hi, Annie?
太棒了  你被录取了012---Fantastic. You got it.
你被录取了012---Oh! You got it.
你问我他是照薪资标准计薪吗  我不知道012---Um, will he work for scale, you ask me? Well, I don't know about that.
我要他那么做  他就得那么做012---Ahem. Except that I do and he will.
太棒了  你真是个甜心012---Great. Oh, you are such a sweetheart.
我很乐意跟你共进午餐012---I would love to have lunch with you.
我们何不约下…012---How about we have lunch next...?
我进隧道了012---Oop, went through a tunnel. Ha, ha.
不可思议012---Unbelievable.
太谢谢你了012---Oh, thank you so much. Ha, ha.
这真的很好玩  我是说我没用过汽车电话012---It was really fun. I mean, I've never talked on a car phone before.
你真的太棒了  你能帮我一个大忙吗012---Oh. You are so amazing. Could you do me this huge favor?
我要参加另一场试镜  但伊斯特始终没办法帮我安排012---There's this one other audition I want, and Estelle couldn't get me in.
我不知道  一次还蛮好玩的  可是…012---Uh, I don't know. It was fun one time, but...
别这样  拜托  再一次就好012---Come on, please? It would just be this one more.
事实上是两次012---Well, actually it's two.
两次   对012---Two?  Yeah.
应该是三次012---Well, really it's three.
拜托  你真的很厉害  我爱你012---Please? You're so good at it. I love you.
好吧  就三次  对吧012---Okay. But just these three, right?
不  是四次012---No, it's four.
为什么今晚你想在家里吃饭012---So how come you wanted to eat in tonight?
因为我要…012---Because I wanted...
送你这个012---...to give you this.
你真的太窝心了012---Oh. Are you a puppy!
壁纸贴012---Contact paper.
跟你上床的人送你壁纸贴时012---You never know what to say when someone you're sleeping with...
你会不知道该说什么012---...gives you contact paper. Ha, ha.
等一下  还有一样礼物  看吧  壁纸贴少不了012---Wait, there's more. See, the contact paper is to go...
全新抽屉012---...in your brand-new drawer.
听着  这是我柜子的抽屉012---See, the drawer actually goes in my dresser.
你不必这么做012---Oh. You didn't have to do this.
我一定要012---Yes, I did.
我一定要  因为你是我的女朋友012---Yes, I did. Because you're my girlfriend...
女朋友就该得到那些东西012---...and that's what girlfriends should get.
我不知道该怎么说012---Oh. Well, I gotta buy a vowel...
因为…天啊012---...because, oh, my God. Mwah.
谁想得到有一天012---Who would've thought that someday...
钱德“兵”会送我抽屉呢012---...Chandler Bing would buy me a drawer?
我也想不到012---Well, not me.
但事实就是那样  还有一件事012---But that's what's happened. And, uh, there's more.
我们该去旅行012---We should take a trip.
是吗012---We should?
对  我们是情侣  情侣都会那么做012---Yup. We're a couple, and that's what couples do.
我要跟你爸妈见面012---And I wanna meet your parents.
我们该跟你爸妈一起旅行012---We should take a trip with your parents.
我想我们不必那么做  因为你吓到我了012---I don't think we need to, because you're tripping me out right now.
你没事吧  我很好012---Are you okay? No, I am.
我好得很  这真的太棒了012---Ha, ha. I actually am. This is amazing.
我一辈子都害怕这么做012---My entire life, I have feared this place.
现在我做了  这有什么大不了的012---And now that I'm here, it's like, what was the big deal?
或许我可以说"我们一起住吧"  我也能接受012---I could probably say, "Let's move in together," and I'd be okay.
或许你要我们住在一起012---You probably want us to move in together?
我不害怕  对  我害怕得要命012---It doesn't scare me.  Yeah, well it scares me.
我还没有办好离婚手续  你邀请我来吃意大利面012---I'm not even divorced yet. You just invited me over here for pasta...
突然间你说我们得住在一起012---...and all of a sudden you're talking about moving in together.
我甚至一点都不饿012---And I wasn't even that hungry.
你知道吗  已经很晚了  我该…012---You know what? It's getting really late, and I should just, um...
别走  我吓到你了  我说太多了012---Don't go. I've scared you. I've said too much.
我无药可救又绝望  渴求着爱情012---I'm hopeless and awkward and desperate for love.
嘿  珍妮丝  是我012---Hey, Janice, it's me.
嗯哈012---Uh, ahem.
我要预先跟你道歉  因为我要跑到街上追你012---I wanted to apologize in advance for having chased you down the street.
再见012---Bye-bye.
拿去吧  甜心 这应该会有帮助012---Here you go, honey. This will help.
我终于追上她  她说012---So I catch up to her and she says...
这段关系发展得太快  我们应该放慢脚步012---...this relationship's going too fast and we have to slow down.
那不是件好事012---Ugh. Ugh. That is never good.
然后她说我…012---Then I got all...
太粘人  太依赖了012---...needy and clingy.
等一下  或许没那么糟糕  你们是怎么分开的012---Now, wait a minute. Maybe it's not so bad. How did you leave it?
她说她会打电话给我012---She said she'd call me.
天啊012---Oh, God.
欢迎光临我们这边的隧道012---Ugh. Welcome to our side of the tunnel.
对了  这个冰淇淋好难吃的012---This ice cream tastes like crap, by the way.
对  那是低卡脱脂豆浆冰淇淋012---Yeah, well, it's that low-cal, nondairy, soy-milk junk.
我们只在无药可救时  才会吃真的冰淇淋012---We save the real stuff for the truly terminal cases.
当你常常无药可救时  就得改吃低脂冰淇淋012---When you start getting screwed over all the time, you gotta switch to low-fat.
没错012---Yeah, you do.
你们不觉得我无药可救012---So you don't think I'm terminal?
当然  你不是无药可救  我们只是得防止事情恶化012---Oh, no, not at all. You're not terminal. We just need some damage control.
好吧  我该打电话给她吗012---Okay. Okay. So should I call her?
不012---No.
现在是关键时刻  如果你想打电话给她012---It's a critical time. If you feel yourself reaching for that phone...
你得去血拼或泡个澡012---...you go shopping, you get your butt in a bubble bath.
如果你要她回来  就得开始表现出高傲的样子012---If you want her back, you have got to start acting aloof.
她得知道你一点都不粘人012---She has to know you're not needy.
你要做的是012---So, what you have to do is...
就是故意跟她巧遇012---...you have to accidentally run into her on purpose...
装出高傲的样子012---...and then act aloof.
那样我就不会失去她012---So I'm not gonna lose her?
甜心  你不是个失败者012---Oh, honey, you're not a total loser.
我是问  我就不会失去她了吗012---I said, so I'm not gonna lose her?
对012---Oh.
看看是谁来了012---Guess who's here.
他是玩具王国的超级硬汉  小班012---It's the toughest guy in Toyland, Ben.
真正的美国英雄  我是特种部队012---Real American hero I'm G.I. Joe
放下洋娃娃…012---Drop the Barbie. Drop the Barbie.
特种部队  你真的觉得他会玩吗012---G.I. Joe? You really think he's gonna fall for that?
特种部队  酷啊  我能玩吗012---G.I. Joe? Cool. Can I play?
看吧  小班  他是保护美国海外石油利益的玩具012---Look, Ben. It's a toy that protects U.S. Oil interests overseas.
加油 加油 特种部队 特种部队012---Go, Joe!
哈罗012---Hello. Oh.
菲比  你来了  不  我走错门了  抱歉012---Phoebe, there you are. No, it's not. Sorry.
菲比  等一下012---But, Phoebe, wait, wait. Phoebe. Phoebe.
乔伊  好吧  你穿那条裤子012---Oh, Joey. Oh, okay. See, I didn't recognize you...
害我都认不出来了012---...in those pants.
听着  我试镜的那部电视电影  有消息了吗012---That TV movie I went in for, did you hear anything?
我想我有机会012---I think I got a shot at it.
对  他们打电话来  你没被录取012---Yes, they called. You didn't get it.
好吗  你没被录取  抱歉012---Okay? I mean, you didn't get it. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
没关系  这种事常发生012---That's okay. These things happen.
但不该是这样的  你知道吗012---But they shouldn't happen. You know what?
你从事一个非常糟糕的行业012---You're in a terrible, terrible business.
我不想害你露出那种表情012---I don't wanna be the person who makes your face look like that. Ugh.
我没事  看吧012---I'm okay. See?
现在你既悲伤又可怕012---Now you're sad and creepy.
你知道吗  对不起  我不干了012---You know what? I'm sorry. I quit, okay?
不  你不能不干了  你是我最棒的经纪人012---No, no, no, you can't quit. You're the best agent I ever had.
听着  当演员就一定会被拒绝  你不能把它视为人身攻击012---Look, rejection is part of being an actor. You can't take it personal.
这不是人身攻击  他们说从没看过  意大利腔这么怪的意大利裔演员012---Not personal? They said they'd never met an Italian actor with a worse Italian accent.
他们真的那样说012---They actually said that?
对  天啊  你又是那个表情  看吧  我没办法做这份工作012---Yeah. Oh, God, there's that face again. See? I can't do this job.
不  所以你非做这份工作不可012---No, this is why you have to do this job.
经纪人老是在说谎012---Agents always lie.
伊斯特会说 "他们挑了其他类型的演员"012---Estelle just says stuff like, "They went another way."
但我可以利用这一点012---But this? I can use this.
我可以练习新腔调012---I can work on a new accent.
好吧  如果那真的能帮助你  好012---Yeah, okay. No. If it helps you, okay. Yeah.
你永远抓不到我  特种部队012---You'll never get me, Joe!
不  谢谢012---No, thank you.
钱德012---Chandler.
哈罗  珍妮丝012---Hello, Janice.
你来这里做什么012---What are you doing here?
我来买东西012---Uh, just a bit of shopping.
你还好吗012---How have you been?
你在学英国口音吗012---Are you being British?
不012---No.
现在不是了012---Not anymore.
你为什么会来这里买东西  你根本不住在这个社区012---Why are you shopping here? You don't live in this neighborhood.
你在这里等我吗012---Were you here waiting for me?
我只是…你知道的012---I'm just, uh, you know...
来买派对需要用的东西012---...picking up some things for a party.
大麦012---Barley?
哪门子的派对会吃大麦012---What kind of a party serves barley?
对不起  我的朋友没有你朋友优雅012---Well, I'm sorry if my friends aren't as sophisticated as yours.
派对在哪里举行  就在这里雀儿喜区012---Where is this party? Here in Chelsea.
派对主人是谁012---Whose party is it?
一个女人  哪个女人012---A woman's.  What woman?
雀儿喜012---Chelsea.
好  这只有两种可能  要不是你背着我偷人012---Either you're seeing somebody behind my back...
那让你成为全世界头号混蛋012---...which would make you the biggest jerk on the planet...
要么就是你假装另结新欢012---...or you're pretending you're seeing somebody...
那让你变得超可悲  我想要当场抱头痛哭012---...which just makes you so pathetic I could just start crying right here.
你想成为哪种男人012---So which of these two guys do you wanna be?
我可以变得跟那个男人一样吗012---Can I be that guy?
好吧  我们又被正面拒绝了  很多地方需要改进012---Okay, we got some more good rejections. Lots of stuff to work on.
好吧  快告诉我012---Oh. Okay. Shoot.
好的  动物园广告012---Okay. Um... Oh, the zoo commercial.
我没被录取  对012---I didn't get it?  No.
他们说你演起人类非常不像012---They said that you "weren't believable as a human being."
你可以加强一下012---So you can work on that.
太棒了  还有什么012---Great. What else?
外百老汇舞台剧的人说  你很帅  可惜太笨了012---Um, the off-Broadway-play people said that you were "pretty but dumb."
不  等一下  抱歉  应该是超级笨才对012---Oh. No, wait, I'm sorry. That's "pretty dumb."
听着  没关系  不  真的012---Oh. Look, it's okay, no, no, no. Really.
听着012---Look, um...
我真的很感激你  菲比012---...I really appreciate this, Pheebs...
但是我想我得回去跟伊斯特合作012---...but I'm gonna have to go back to Estelle.
嗯012---Oh.
别误会我  做起经纪人  你比她优秀多了012---Don't get me wrong. You're a better agent than she is...
至少跟她在一起  我的笨脑袋不会爆炸012---...but at least with her, I don't wanna blow my pretty dumb brains out.
对  不  我了解012---Yeah, no, I understand.
是吗   谢谢  好吧  对012---You do? Thanks. Okay. Yeah.
抱歉012---Sorry.
等一下  什么012---Wait a minute. What?
等一下012---Wait a minute.
你编出那些东西  只为了不想当我的经纪人吗012---Did you just make all that stuff up to get out of being my agent?
喔  被发现了012---Oh, he caught me.
我被捉包了012---I am so busted.
我就怀疑会是那样012---That's what I suspected.
然后我…你们知道的012---And then I just, you know...
丢下那包大麦  跑出超市012---...threw the bag of barley at her and ran out of the store.
天啊  钱德  我们要你高傲一点 不是要你当傻瓜012---My God, Chandler, we said be aloof, not a doof.
我真的毁了一切  对吧012---I've actually ruined this, haven't I?
现在能吃真的冰淇淋了  对吧012---It's time for the good ice cream now, right?
没错  好吧012---Yeah, it is. Okay.
你知道吗  一定会没事的012---You know what? Everything's gonna be okay.
喂012---Hello?
嗨  珍妮丝012---Hi, Janice.
你能等一下吗012---Can you hold on for a second?
好吧012---Okay. Okay.
我该怎么办012---What do I do?
我不知道  从来没发生过这种事012---I don't know. This is unprecedented.
如果我们做出你做过的事  男人从不会打电话来012---If we ever did what you did, a man would never call.
怎么办012---Hello?
我知道了  假装你刚睡醒  那会把她气坏了012---I got it. Pretend you just woke up. That'll throw her off.
瞌睡虫  对  懒散一点012---Be sleepy.  Yes. And grumpy.
你们在…别一直叫小矮人的名字012---What are you...? Stop naming dwarves.
喂  珍妮丝  嗨012---Hello, Janice. Hi.
我很高兴你打电话来012---I'm so glad that you called.
我知道我最近怪怪的012---I know I've been acting really weird lately...
那是因为我为你疯狂012---...and it's just because I'm crazy about you...
我变得好蠢的  非常害怕012---...and I just got stupid and scared...
好几次做出傻事012---...and stupid a couple more times.
对不起012---And I'm sorry.
真的吗012---Really?
真的吗012---Ha, ha. Really?
他太幸运了  如果珍妮丝是男人012---He's so lucky. If Janice were a guy...
她已经跟别人上床了012---...she'd be sleeping with somebody else by now.
我也爱你012---I love you too.
太不公平了012---Ugh. It's so unfair.
特种部队012---G.I. Joe? G.I. Joe?
我不知道该怎么跟你们说  那是他选的娃娃012---Hey, I don't know what to tell you guys. That's the doll he chose.
你做了什么  在玩具上沾糖012---What'd you do, dip it in sugar?
听着  特种部队来了  洋娃娃得闪一边012---Look, G.I. Joe's in, Barbie's out.
如果你们无法接受  那是你们的问题012---And if you guys can't deal with it, that's just your too bad.
你干嘛这么紧张  他有洋娃娃  没什么了不起的012---What are you being such a weenie for? So he has a Barbie. Big deal.
以前你会打扮成女生012---You used to dress up like a woman.
什么012---What?
你以前总是会穿妈妈的衣服012---The way you used to dress up in Mom's clothes?
你在胡说什么012---What are you talking about?
大帽子  珍珠项链  粉红色小手提包012---The big hat, the pearls, the little pink handbag?
好吧  那全是你编出来的012---Okay. You are totally making this up.
你怎么会不记得012---How can you not remember?
你逼我们叫你小碧012---You made us call you "Bea"?
天啊012---Oh, God.
我从来没有这么快乐过012---I've literally never been this happy.
你不是很喜欢唱那首歌吗012---Wasn't there a little song?
拜托  天啊  我们想听012---Oh, please, God, let there be a song.
我才没有唱歌012---There was no song. There was no song.
我是小碧012---I am Bea
我会喝茶  够了012---I drink tea... That's enough.
你不想…012---Won't you?
嗯012---Oh.

我们一直说需要放信件的地方012---You know how we're always saying we need a place for the mail.
对012---Yeah.
所以我就开工了012---Well, I started building one.
然后呢  我决定更加完善一点012---But then I decided to take it to the next step.
你在盖邮局012---You're building a post office?
不是  是一个娱乐专用柜  内含信件柜012---No, an entertainment unit, with a mail cubby built right in.
最多一天搞定  好吧012---It's a one-day job, max.  Okay.
天啊  你的裤子有够紧012---My word, those are snug.
对  这是我的旧工作裤012---Oh, yeah. These are my old work pants.
意大利名牌012---Sergio Valente.

你不是只见过他一次吗  是啊012---I thought you only met him once. Yeah, I did.
这样讲很有姐姐的口气012---I think it sounds, you know, big sister-y
"法兰克老是迟到"012---"Frank's always late." So...
放轻松  他会来的012---Oh. Well, relax. He'll be here.
我知道  我只是很紧张012---Yeah, no, I know. I'm just nervous. Oh.
我妈死了  我不和我姐姐说话012---You know, it's just, you know, Mom's dead, don't talk to my sister...
奶奶最近睡很多觉012---...Grandma's been sleeping a lot lately.
这是我感受家人温暖的  最后机会012---It's just the "last desperate chance to have a family" kind of thing.
你真窝心  还陪我等012---Mm. You're so sweet to wait with me.
其实是阿甘叫我来的  杯子不能拿出店外012---Well, actually, Gunther sent me. You're not allowed to have cups out here.
还有谁觉得  大卫考柏菲可爱012---Does anyone else think David Copperfield's cute?

等一下  你是说这么做012---Well, wait, you mean like this?  Yeah.
对  你也会012---Yeah, you can do it too. Yeah.

还有伊莎贝拉罗塞里尼012---And Isabella Rossellini.
很辣  很性感012---Ooh. Ooh. Very hot. Very sexy.

所以呢  所以你得挑可能性大一点的012---So? So you gotta play the odds.
找一个会一直在国内的人012---Pick somebody who's gonna be in the country, like, all the time.
对啊  你之所以搞不定伊莎贝拉  因为地理因素012---Yeah. Because that's why you won't get Isabella Rossellini. Geography.

我以为他会更有弟弟的威觉012---I don't know, I just thought, you know, that he'd feel more like a brother.
就像你和罗斯   亲密融洽012---Like you and Ross. Just close and connected and...
现在是很亲  但是你不会相信  在以前…012---Oh. We're close now, but you wouldn't believe the years...
我们又吵又打  又拉又扯012---...of noogies and wedgies and flying wedgies and atomic wedgies and...
然后裙子就会被扯到头上来012---That's when the waistband actually goes over your head.
嗯012---Ah.

你在做什么工作012---Hey, what kind of work do you do? Oh.
我是按摩师  我帮客人按摩012---I'm a masseuse. I give people massages and stuff.
你在那种按摩院工作012---You work at one of those massage parlors?

可能所有的尺都有问题012---Maybe all the rulers are wrong.
还不算太差吧012---Look, it's not that bad.
那又怎样  挡你的门一点点  我的一点点012---So what? It blocks a little of your door, a little of my door.

搞不好012---Yeah, maybe.
骗人012---Oh, heh. You lie.
你不认为我会行动012---You don't think I'd go up to her?
你花了十年承认你喜欢我012---Ross, it took you 10 years to finally admit you liked me.
是吗   你最好庆幸这份名单已经塑封了012---Yeah? Well, missy, you better be glad that list is laminated. Heh.

摩妮卡  我有一个月的时间  睡不着觉012---Monica, do you know I couldn't sleep for a month...

你可以把抱枕翻面啊012---You could've just turned the cushion over.
本来会的  但是另外一边  沾到意大利面酱汁012---I would have, but I had a spaghetti stain on the other side.

你没有男友是因为…012---You don't have a boyfriend because...
我不知道为什么  你没有男友012---I don't know why you don't have a boyfriend.
你应该要有的012---You should have a boyfriend.

我想我的婚姻…012---I think my marriage...
应该是完蛋了012---...is kind of over.
不会吧  怎么了012---Oh, no! Why?
因为卡萝是女同志012---Because Carol's a lesbian.
而我不是女同志012---And I'm not one.
而且这显然不是一时激情012---And apparently it's not a mix-and-match situation.
天啊012---Oh, my God!
我不敢相信012---I don't believe it!
可怜的孩子012---Oh, you poor bunny.
我是个白痴012---I'm an idiot.

卡萝和我出门时  她如果看到漂亮的女生…012---I mean, Carol and I would be out, and she'd see some beautiful woman...
就会说 "罗斯  你快看"012---...and she'd be, "Ross! Look at her!"
我还觉得…012---And I'd think
"天啊  我老婆太酷了"012---"God, my wife is cool." Heh.
嘿  你觉得那个苏珊  是她的情人吗012---Aw. Hey, do you think that Susan person is her lover?

我学到在肥皂剧中012---...uh, ahem, I learned that one of the most important things...
最重要的一件事就是反应012---...in soap opera acting is reacting.
不代表再演一次012---This does not mean acting again.
这代表你没有台词  而是别人刚讲完012---It means you don't have a line, but someone else just did.
就像这样012---And it goes something like this. Ahem.
谢了…012---Thanks. Thanks. Thanks a lot.

那么…012---So.
图书馆怎么样  是博物馆012---How's the library? Uh, museum.
图书馆怎么了  从来都没有过图书馆012---What happened to the library?  There never was a library.
我是说  到处都有图书馆012---I mean, there are libraries. It's just that I, um...
但我没在任何一间工作过012---I've never worked at one. Ha, ha.
你们知道这里什么好吃吗012---You know what's really good here?
龙虾012---The lobster. Mm.
你觉得怎样  直接点三只  好啊  如果你很饿的话012---What do you say? Shall I just order three? Yeah, if you're really hungry. Ha, ha.
那是笑话  我在开玩笑012---It was a joke. I made a joke.
其实  罗斯对龙虾过敏012---Yeah, actually, Daddy, Ross is allergic to lobster.
什么人会对龙虾过敏012---What kind of person's allergic to lobster?
大概是在图书馆工作的人吧012---I guess the kind of person that works in a library. Ha, ha.
不是… 我知道  是博物馆012---It's not...  I know. It's a museum.
只有你可以开玩笑吗  至少我的比较好笑  服务生012---What, you're the only who can make a joke? At least mine was funny. Uh, waiter.
我们要两只龙虾  和一份菜单012---We will have two lobsters and a menu.
葛林医生  那艘旧船怎么样了012---So, Dr. Green, how's the old boat?
他们发现有铁锈012---They found rust.
你知道锈会让船怎样吗  有怀旧风012---Do you know what rust does to a boat?  Gives it a nice antique-y look?
铁锈等同于船癌  罗斯012---Rust is boat cancer, Ross.
哇  真遗憾012---Wow, I'm sorry.
我小时候就这样  失去了一台脚踏车012---When I was a kid, I lost a bike to that. Ha, ha.
失陪一下012---Excuse me for a moment, will you, please?
我们走之前  我想跟莱文他们说再见012---I wanna say good night to the Levines before we go.
好012---Okay.
亲爱的  别这样  没那么糟糕012---Honey, stop. It's not that bad.
是啊012---Yeah. Oh.
我想你爸算错了012---Uh-oh. I think your dad must have added wrong.
他只给了百分之四的小费012---He only tipped, like, 4 percent.
对  他就是这样012---Yeah. Ahem, that's Daddy.
"他就是这样"  这不会困扰你吗  你也是服务生012---"That's Daddy"? Doesn't it bother you? You're a waitress.
的确会  罗斯012---Yes, it bothers me, Ross.
但如果他是咖啡厅的常客…012---But, you know, if he was a regular at the coffee house...
我会在饮料里加胡椒012---...I'd be serving him sneezers.
那又怎样  罗斯…012---So?  So, Ross...
我跟他抱怨几百次了  他就是不改012---...I've bugged him about this a million times. He's not gonna change.
你真的在饮料里加胡椒012---Do you really serve people sneezers?
嗯  我是不会012---Ahem, well, um, I don't.
好了  准备走了吗  好了012---All right, kids. Ready? Yes.
再次谢谢你  葛林医生012---Thanks again, Dr. Green. Uh-huh.
等等  我忘了拿帐单012---Wait, wait, wait, I think I forgot my receipt.
噢  你不需要的  为什么012---Oh, you don't need that. - Ahem, why not?
复写纸很脏会沾到手指  引发…012---The carbon. It's messy. I mean, gets on your fingers and causes...
夜盲症012---...the, uh, night blindness.
这是什么012---What is this?
谁放的二十元012---Who put a 20 down here?
噢  是我012---Huh? Oh, yeah, that would be me.
我…我有个问题012---Um, I have... I have a problem.
我小费给太多了  太多了012---I tip way too much, way, way too much.
到了病态的地步  没错012---It's a sickness, really. Yeah, it is. It is.
我们得想点办法  抱歉012---We have to do something about that. Excuse me.
你觉得我很小气012---You think I'm cheap?
爸  他没有这个意思012---He didn't mean anything by that. - Huh?
真的没有  我做的事都没什么意思012---He really didn't. Nothing I do means anything. Really.
太棒了  晚餐我付了两百块012---This is nice. I pay $200 for dinner.
你只放了20元  就一副大爷的样子012---You put down 20 and you come out looking like Mr. Big-Shot.
你真的想当大爷吗  不012---You really wanna be Mr. Big-Shot? Oh.
这样吧  帐单由你来付  大爷012---Here. I'll tell you what. You pay the whole bill, Mr. Big-Shot. All right?
至少"大爷" 比"油头"好多了012---Well, "Mr. Big-Shot" is better than "Wet-Head."
来点演戏的小诀窍012---Okay, some tricks of the trade.
我演戏时都哭不出来012---Now, I've never been able to cry as an actor...
如果我得演哭戏…012---...so if I'm in a scene where I have to cry...
我会在口袋剪个洞012---...I cut a hole in my pocket...
放个钳子在里面012---...take a pair of tweezers...
然后开始拔毛012---...and just start pulling.
好… 假如我要表现…012---Okay. Or uh... Or let's say I want to convey...
刚做了坏事的感觉012---...that I've, uh, just done something evil.
就得做出"我的眉毛  有个鱼钩"的表情012---Well, that would be your basic I've-got-a fish-hook-in-my-eyebrow-and-I-like-it.
好吗  假如我刚刚听到坏消息012---No? Okay. Let's say I've just gotten bad news.
我就会试着心算232除以13012---Well, all I do there is try and divide 232 by 13.
就是这样012---And that's how it's done.
今晚的肥皂剧演出到此结束012---Great soap opera acting tonight, everybody.

百分之四  就算食物里面有虫  我给的小费都比这个多012---Four percent, okay? I tip more than that when there's a bug in my food.
罗斯  今晚只是  要让你们两个处得来012---Ross, tonight was about the two of you getting along.

摩妮卡交待我做一件事  她不该这么做的012---Monica kind of trusted me with something and she shouldn't have.
我很久不住在这里了  所以我得问你012---All right, I haven't lived here in a while, so I have to ask you.
摩妮卡睡觉时还是会开灯吗012---Does Monica still turn the lights on in her bedroom?
会  我完蛋了012---Ahem. Yeah.  I am so dead.
好  听好我的重点  罗斯012---All right, look, here's the bottom line, Ross.
动作快的话  还可以补救  好吗012---This is fixable if we act fast, okay?
明天我请他吃早午餐  你可以表现得和善一点012---So I'll invite him to brunch tomorrow and you can make nice.
亲爱的  我试过了  但是没用012---Honey, I have tried to make nice. It doesn't work.
好  我知道我爸很难搞…012---Okay. Look, I realize my father is difficult...
所以你心胸要放大一点012---...but that's why you have got to be the bigger man here.
亲爱的  我可以心胸大一点012---Look, sweetie, I could be the bigger man. I could be the biggest man.
我心胸可以超大的  但情况还是不会改变012---I could be a big, huge, giant man and it still wouldn't make a difference.
除了把他抓起来说 "你得喜欢我  小医生"之外012---Except that I could pick your father up and say, "Like me. Like me, tiny doctor."
好  你可不可以再试一次  就当作是为了我012---Okay, well, can't you just try it one more time, Ross? For me? For me?
瑞秋  一场早午餐  是不能解决问题的012---Rachel, one brunch is not gonna solve anything.
面对事实吧  我们就是合不来012---You've gotta face it. We're never gonna get along.
好  你就是得试试看012---Okay, well, you are just going to have to.
懂吗  我已经有两个  无法共处一室的父母012---Okay? I've already got a mother and father who cannot stay in the same room.
我不想再多你一个012---I don't want to have a separate room for you too.
好…012---Okay, okay. Okay.
我去买甜甜圈012---I'll get the bagels.
这是什么012---What's this?
很酷吧012---Isn't it cool? Vroom. Vroom.
这不是我订的床垫012---This is not the bed I ordered.
我知道  你一定是赢了某种大奖012---I know. You must have won, like, a contest or something.
菲比012---Phoebe.
为什么这台车  会在我房间012---Why is this car in my bedroom?
对不起  我那时没注意…012---I'm sorry, okay. I wasn't looking...

好吧  如果你还活着  你该接电话的012---Okay, if you're alive, you answer your phone!
小班  我不会跟你爸说  你在晚餐前吃冰淇淋012---Ben, I won't tell your daddy that you had ice cream before dinner...
只要你不跟他说  撞到头的小意外012---...if you won't tell him about our little bonking incident.
第一   我想小班不了解贿赂的概念012---Number one, I don't think Ben understands the concept of bribery.
第二  我…012---And number two, I...
什么012---What?
你说 "第二"012---You said "number two."
我还说了 "第一"012---I also said "number one."
我知道012---Ha-ha-ha, I know.
大家好012---Hey, everyone! Hi!
我儿子还好吗012---How's my little boy?
他好得很  对吧  小班012---He's perfect. Aren't you, Ben?
他再好不过了  你们做了什么   带他去捕鲸吗012---He's never been better. What did you do, take him whaling?
摩妮卡012---Monica.
天啊  他会叫你的名字 太棒了  做得好  小班012---Oh, my God! He just said your name! That's great! Good job, Ben!
摩妮卡撞到了012---Monica bang!
没错012---Ha-ha-ha. That's right.
那就是我爆炸的声音012---That's what I'd sound like if I exploded.
诅咒解除了 我联络了所有认识的人012---Woo-hoo! The curse is broken! I called everybody I know...
大家都活着012---...and everyone is alive!
什么012---Huh. What?
丑八怪裸男一动都不动012---Ugly Naked Guy looks awfully still.
天啊  我又杀人了012---Oh, my God, I killed another one!
诅咒越来越强  连那么胖的人都会死012---The curse is getting stronger too, to bring down something that big.
或许他只是在睡午觉012---Maybe he's just taking a nap.
我得说他从今天早上开始  就一动都不动的012---I'm telling you, he hasn't moved since this morning.
或许我们该报警012---We should call somebody.
跟他们说我们偷窥的裸男  一动都不动012---Tell them the naked guy we stare at isn't moving?
我们得知道他是不是还活着012---We've got to find out if he's alive.
我们该怎么办   那是不可能的012---How are we gonna do that? There's no way.
有个办法012---Well, there is one way.
他的窗户没关  我是说…012---His window's open. I say...
我们可以戳戳他012---...we poke him.
嘿012---Hey!
我们吃中国菜时012---You know how we, uh, save all those chopsticks...
不是会把筷子留下来吗012---...for no reason when we get Chinese food?
怎么了012---Yeah?
现在能派上用场了012---Well, now we got a reason.
什么012---What?
我们要做非常长的戳人棒012---Well, we're fashioning a very long poking device.
好吧012---All right.
怎么了012---Hey, uh, what's the matter?
我跟珍妮丝谈过012---I talked to Janice.
天啊  她要跟他复合吗012---Oh, my God. Is she going back to him?
她不知道012---She doesn't know.
她说她爱我们两个012---Says she loves us both.
今天早上醒来时我沉溺在爱河里012---I woke up this morning, I was in love.
我很幸福012---I was happy!
所以我去买了12包保险套012---It serves me right for buying that 12-pack of condoms.
现在我没办法退货  因为她把收据吞下去了012---And now I can't even return them, because she choked on the receipt!
你打算怎么办012---What are you, uh...? What are you gonna do?
我不知道012---I don't know.
你会怎么做呢012---You know? What would you do?
我会怎么做并不重要012---Uh, it doesn't matter what I'd do.
来吧  快告诉我012---Come on. Come on. Tell me.
好吧  你…012---All right, you, uh...
或许你不想听  可是…012---...you probably won't want to hear this, but, uh...
换作是我  这是我的做法  我会…012---...if it was me, and this is just me, I would, uh...
我会自己闪人  什么012---I would bow out. What?
你在胡说什么012---What are you talking about?
他们有个孩子012---They have a kid together...
你知道吗   他们是…012---...you know? They're like...
他们是一家人012---They're, like, a family.
如果…我不知道012---And if, I don't know...
如果他们有机会复合012---...if there's a chance they can make that work...
我不想变成破坏他们家庭的人012---...I wouldn't want to be the guy who stood in the way.
你没事吧012---You okay?
你…012---You, uh?
你要去戳裸男吗012---You wanna come poke a nude guy?
他终于睡着了012---Well, he's finally asleep. Mm.
他的头肿了起来012---About that, uh, bump on his head...
你确定那是新伤口吗012---Are you, uh, sure it's a new bump?
我没有恶意  但我一直觉得他满头是包012---No offense, but I've always thought of Ben as a fairly bumpy-headed child.
撞到头也没关系  小孩子经常撞到头012---It's okay if he bumps his head. Kids bump their heads all the time.
这是你第一次当褓姆  你尽力了012---It was your first time babysitting. You did your best.
我尽力了  我知道012---I did! I know.
不过你得随时盯着012---You just have to watch them all the time.
我有啊  我有看着他012---I did! I watched! I watched!
我看到摩妮卡撞到他的头012---I watched Monica bang his head against that thing!
那是摩妮卡撞的012---Monica did it?
摩妮卡   什么012---Monica? Um... Yeah.
你有没有发现  班今天怪怪的012---Did you notice anything weird about Ben today?
没有啊  怎么了012---No, why?
我跟他玩  我们在唱字母歌012---I was just playing with him, and we were doing the "Alphabet Song"...
那是他的拿手歌曲  但他忘了唱E跟F012---...which he's good at. But he left out "E" and "F."
就像是…我不知道  他完全忘得精光012---It's like they just, uh, I don't know, fell out of his head.
真的吗012---Really?
还有他走路的样子012---Oh, and also, he's walking...
有点怪怪的012---...kind of funny.
他的左脚比右脚迈步快012---It's like his left leg is moving a lot faster than his right leg.
对  他在房里会这么做012---Yeah, he's in there, just sort of, you know...
天啊  我把你儿子弄坏了012---Oh, my God! I wrecked your baby!
希望你下了地狱  还会觉得好玩012---I hope it's still funny when you're in hell.
你这个混蛋012---You jerk!
你知道我爱那个孩子  摩妮卡撞到了012---You know I love that kid! Monica bang! Monica bang!
我去拿帽子012---I'll get the hat.
珍妮丝  我有事要跟你说012---I have something to tell you.
我要你听我说完012---And I want you to let me get through it...
因为…012---...because...
要说出口并不容易012---...it's not gonna be easy.
好的012---Okay.
我想你该跟盖瑞复合012---I think you should go back with Gary.
我不想拆散你们一家人012---I don't want to be the guy that breaks up a family.
我爸妈因为那个男人分手012---You know, when my parents split up, it was because of that guy.
每次见到他  我都会想012---Whenever I'd see him, I'd always think:
就是你害的  你让他们无法在一起012---"You're the reason. You are why they're not together."
我恨那个男人012---And I hated that guy.
不论他人多好  他让我爸多么开心012---And it didn't matter how nice he was or how happy he made my dad.
没错012---Yeah, wow.
这么做才是对的012---It's the right thing to do.  Ugh.
你说的对012---You're right.
天啊   在我跟你道别前012---Oh, God. But before I can say goodbye...
我有件事得跟你说012---...there's something I really need you to know.
我对你的感觉012---The way I feel about you...
我终于能体会012---...it's like I finally understand...
莱诺李奇唱的那首歌012---...what Lionel Richie's been singing about.
你知道吗   我们拥有的一切012---You know? I mean, what we have...
像是电影里的爱情故事012---...it's like movie love.
你是我的灵魂伴侣012---You're my soul mate.
我不敢相信我们无法共度一生012---I can't believe we're not gonna spend the rest of our lives together.
那就别离开我012---Then don't leave me.
什么012---What?
忘了我说过的话  我在胡说八道  挑我吧012---Forget what I said! I was babbling! Pick me!
不  你说的对  我得再给我的婚姻一次机会012---No, you were right! I gotta give my marriage another chance.
不  你不能那么做012---Pssh! No, you don't!
不  我是说  你得给你的离婚一次机会012---No, I say you have to give your divorce another chance!
对不起012---I'm sorry.
别走012---Oh, don't go.
不  我非走不可012---No, I gotta go.
不012---No. No. No, no.
甜心012---Honey. Honey. Ha, ha.
大家都在看  我不在乎012---People are looking.  I don't care.
我不在乎012---I don't care!
对  好吧  我…012---Yeah, um, okay. I'm...
我要走了012---I'm leaving now.
你走不了  我把你的鞋子拿走了012---You can't leave! I have your shoe!
再见  钱德宾012---Goodbye, Chandler Bing.
瑞秋也有一双紫红色的012---Rachel has those in burgundy.
记得  像这样又粗又长的东西  操作起来会非常困难012---Remember, something this big and long will be very difficult to maneuver.
还好在那方面  我的经验丰富012---Fortunately, I have experience in that area.
专心一点吗   一个裸男的性命岌岌可危012---Can we please focus here? A naked man's life hangs in the balance.
我赌他死了012---I'm telling you, he's dead.
我们会发现  插了一根棍子的死胖子012---What we're about to have here is a dead fat guy on a stick!
好了  各位先生女士  开始戳012---All right, ladies and gentlemen, let's poke.
稳住012---Steady.
好的  高一点012---Okay, a little higher.
注意角度012---Careful of the angle.
好的  已经到窗边了012---Okay, okay. We're approaching the window.
穿过去012---Thread the needle. Thread the needle.
他还活着012---He's alive! He's alive!
对  我们还在戳他012---And yet we're still poking him.
好吧  收工了012---Okay, retract the device! Retract the device!
他好像不太爽012---He does not look happy. Hey, hey.
他露出他戳人的东西了012---Now he's showing us his poking device.
那是戳不到这里来的  兄弟012---Hey, that's never gonna make it all the way over here, buddy! Ha.
拜托啊012---Oh,come on!
这也是你们的感恩节012---Hey, it's your Thanksgiving too.
除了看足球  你们还可以帮忙012---You know, instead of watching football, you could help.
我们知道012---We know.
瑞秋  你要将棉花糖排成同心圆012---Rachel, you wanna put the marshmallows in concentric circles.
不  是你要把它们排成同心圆012---No, you want to put them in concentric circles.
我要这么做012---I want to do this.
每年都是这样012---Every year.
《老友记》 第三季 第9集  美式足球比赛012---Friends S03E09 The One with the Football
十码  五码  触地得分  巨人队达阵得分012---To the 10, to the 5. Touchdown, Giants!
我真的想要看一下比赛012---You know, for once, I am gonna try to watch one of these things.
中场休息012---Halftime.
谁要玩一下球012---Who wants to, uh, throw the ball around?
三对三   那应该会很好玩012---Get a little 3-on-3 going? Oh, that would be so much fun!
我能玩吗  我从未玩过足球012---Can I play too?I've never played football, ever.
太棒了  你可以防守钱德012---Great! You can cover Chandler.
我不想玩012---I don't... I don't really want to play.
你跟珍妮丝分手后什么事都没做012---You never do anything since you and Janice broke up.
才不是这样012---Not true.
我想整天穿着睡袍啃花生012---I wanted to wear my bathrobe and eat peanut clusters all day.
一早开始喝酒  别说我没有目标012---And start drinking in the morning. Don't say I don't have goals!
你得开始忘了她  好吗012---You have to start getting over her, all right?
玩球或许能让你忘记珍妮丝012---If you play, maybe it'll take your mind off Janice.
如果你不玩  大家会生你的气  因为两队人数不一样012---If you don't, everyone will be mad at you because the teams won't be even.
好吧  我玩就是了012---All right, I'll play.
来玩吧  罗斯012---Yay! Yay! Let's do it! Ross?
什么  要玩足球吗012---What? Wanna play football?
嗯...012---Um...
摩妮卡跟我不能玩足球012---Monica and I aren't supposed to play football.
谁说的   你们妈妈说的012---Says who? Your mom? Ha-ha-ha.
对 对012---Yes.
以前每年感恩节我们都会玩足球赛012---Ahem. Every Thanksgiving, um, we used to have a touch football game...
它就叫做盖勒杯012---...called The Geller Bowl.
不  你得骄傲地说出来才行012---No, no, no. You say that proudly!
总之我跟罗斯总是当队长012---Anyway, Ross and I were always captains, and, um...
竞争很激烈  有一年  第六届盖勒杯012---It got kind of competitive. And one year, Geller Bowl VI...
我不小心打断罗斯的鼻子012---...I accidentally broke Ross' nose.
你是故意的012---It was so not an accident.
她看到我就快抱住她  就用她的…012---She saw I was about to tag her, so she threw...
用她那老奶奶般的粗手臂打我的脸012---...her big fat grandma-arm elbow in my face...
然后拼命往前跑012---...and just kept running.
对了  我达阵得分获得胜利012---To score the winning touchdown, by the way.
哇啊  哦  啊  哦012---Whoa, whoa, whoa! Heh.
你没赢  达阵得分不算012---Uh, you did not win the game. The touchdown didn't count...
因为你犯规了  非常野蛮地打断了我的鼻子012---...because of the spectacularly illegal, and savage, nose-breaking.
我赢了那场比赛012---I won the game.
是吗   为什么你没拿到盖勒杯012---Yeah? Then how come you didn't get the Geller Cup?
还有盖勒杯012---Ahem, there was a Geller Cup?
对  赢的人可以拿到奖杯012---Yes, the trophy you got if you won the game.
但爸说没有人赢   他讨厌我们打架012---But Dad said nobody won, and he was sick of our fighting.
所以他把奖杯拿走012---So he took the trophy...
丢进湖里012---...threw it in the lake.
诅咒破解了吗012---And was the curse lifted?
总之…012---Anyway...
妈说我们再也不准玩足球012---...Mom said we weren't allowed to play football again.
你知道吗   我想我们能打一场比赛012---You know what? I think we should play a game.
少来了  那是十二年前的事012---I mean, come on. It's been 12 years.
我们能谈一谈吗012---Can I see you for a second?
胆小鬼012---Wuss!
好吧  我们要玩012---All right, we're gonna play.
等一下  我们怎么去球场   我妈不让我过街012---Wait. How we gonna get there? My mom won't let me cross the street.
来吧012---Here you go.
好吧012---All right.
开始了  等一下012---Let's bring it in. Wait.
甜心  传给我012---Honey, throw it to me!
接住了012---Here you go. Aah!
你差点打中我的脸012---That almost hit me in the face!
我们得选出队长012---We have to pick captains.
然后挑选队员012---And then "Tennilles."
该怎么选呢012---So how do we decide that?
我们何不跳兔子舞  什么012---Why don't we just bunny up? What?
兔子  兔子012---Bunny!  Bunny!
看起来罗斯跟我是队长012---Looks like Ross and I are captains.
好吧  我先跳的  我能先选  乔伊012---Okay, so, um, I bunnied first, so I get to pick first. Joey.
谢谢  摩妮卡012---Thank you.  Monica.
我是你的好朋友012---I'm your best friend.
甜心  别担心  你会被选中的012---Sweetie, don't worry, you'll get picked.
钱德012---Chandler.
罗斯  菲比012---Ross?  Phoebe.
甜心  我挑你了012---Sweetie, now I pick you.
你才没有挑我  你是没有选择了012---You don't pick me. You're stuck with me!
好吧  就这么办了012---Okay. All right. So let's see.
比赛场地从垃圾桶到灯柱  好吗012---Let's play from the, uh, trash can to the light post, right?
双手达阵得分  比赛开始了012---Two-hand touch. We'll kick off.
各位  听着  我还有28分钟012---People, listen. I've got 28 minutes...
然后我得去帮火鸡涂酱汁012---...before I have to baste again.
就像在参加职业比赛012---Wow, just like in the pros.
好吧  临场会议012---Okay, huddle up! Whoo! Woo-hoo.
到这边开临场会议  等等我012---Huddle up over here! Wait for me! Wait for me!
酷啊  我的第一次临场会012---Oh, cool! My first huddle.
好吧   好吧012---Okay. Ha, ha. Okay.
你们对钱德有什么想法012---So what do you guys really think of Chandler?
你知道你要做什么吧    对012---You know what you're doing, right?  Yeah.
好吧  乔伊接球  我们阻挡012---Okay. Joey will catch it. We'll block.
什么是阻挡012---What's "block"?
我以为你知道你要做什么   我以为你是指在生活中012---I thought you knew what you were doing. I thought you meant in life!
分开012---Break!
球是珍妮丝012---The ball is Janice. The ball is Janice.
大混蛋012---Ow! Son of a...! Ow!
拜托哦   对不起012---Come on! I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
你们知道吗   我们要直接丢球012---You know what? We're just gonna throw it.
我来接012---I got it!
来吧012---Go, go, go!
得分  七比零012---Score! Seven to nothing!
甜心  你没事吧012---Honey, you okay?
来吧  我们走012---Come on, let's go.
输家滚开012---Whoo. Losers walk.
是吗   输家只爱放话012---Yeah? Losers talk.
不  你得跟"输家"押韵012---No, no, actually, losers rhyme.
你要直接来   对012---You wanna go shotgun? Yeah.
开球012---Hike.
这边  这里…012---One Mississippi... Over here! Over here! Unh.
我差点接到那一球012---Ha! I almost caught that one!
太棒了  现在比数是七比差点七012---Great. Now the score's seven to almost seven.
好吧  这一球我要你直冲切右012---Okay, on this play, I want you to do a down-and-out to the right, okay?
分开  等一下  我要做什么012---Break! Wait. What am I gonna do?
你呢012---You?
你直接冲012---You go long.
冲到哪里012---How long?
到你几乎看不见我们为止012---Until we start to look very small.
好的  分开  分开012---Okay. Break! Break!
预备  开始012---Set, hike! One Mississippi...
换边  换边012---Switch! Switch! Switch!
不  不012---No, no, no, no!
谢谢你帮我们捡球012---Hey. Thanks for stopping our ball.
你们在玩美式足球012---You are playing American football?
对012---Yeah.
你好像是外国人012---Wow, you're, like, from a whole other country!
我是荷兰人   我是乔伊012---I'm Dutch.Hi, I'm Joey.
我是玛哈012---I am Margha.
抱歉  荷兰人  尾音我没听清楚012---Sorry, Dutch, I didn't get that last little bit. Ha-ha-ha.
你要玩足球或…我是钱德012---You wanna play football or...? Hi, I'm Chandler.
你好  钱德012---Hello, Chandler.
她叫荷兰人跟玛汉012---Her name is Dutch and also "Margham."
玛哈   玛荷012---Margha. Margha.
玛哈012---Margha.
玛汉012---Mahan.
来吧  大伙们  开始了  第二次十码进攻012---Come on, guys! Let's go! Second down!
应该是第三次十码进攻了  才不是  是第二次012---Uh, hello? It's third down.  No, it's not. It's second.
怎么了012---Wow. "Wow" what?
我很讶异你还是会这么做012---It just amazes me that you're still pulling stuff like this. Heh.
什么  本来就是第二次进攻  好吧  第二次012---Pulling what? It's second down. Okay, it's second down.
你说是就是012---Take all the second downs you need.
我听到了  我本来就说得很大声012---I heard that. Well, I said it loud.
我可以在旁边看吗012---It is okay if I stay and watch?
就坐那边吧   对  你何不留下来呢012---Just sit right there. Yeah, why don't you stick around?
一切进行得很顺利   我也那么想012---That went well. I think so.
我想跟她要电话号码012---I was thinking about, uh, asking her for her number.
谢了  兄弟  我自己问的话会比较有诚意012---Thanks, man, but it makes a stronger statement if I ask for it myself.
我是想自己追她  为了忘记珍妮丝012---I was thinking about for me, as part of that getting-over-Janice thing.
对  没错012---Oh, yeah. That.
如果这么重要  我就让你追她012---If it means that much, I'll let you have her.
谢谢012---Thanks.
什么   让我追她012---Wh...? "Let me have her"?
你是说你不让我的话  我就毫无机会吗012---You mean if you didn't, I wouldn't have a shot?
我真的不想说出来012---I don't like to say it out loud...
但事实就是如此012---...but yeah!
每个人都有自己的优点  你对数字就比较在行012---We all have our strengths. You're better with numbers and stuff.
数学   你要跟我提数学的事012---Math? You're giving me math?

我只是在人群中前后跑动012---All I'm doing is running back and forth from the huddle.
你想待在那边吗012---Well, uh, you wanna just stay out there?
球能给我一下吗   好的012---Can I see that for a second? Yeah.
好的  好的  开始了012---Okay. Okay, let's go.
我来盯钱德  开始012---I got Chandler   Hike!

我对数学真的很在行012---Hey, I am good at math!
够了  我还是要让你去追她012---That's it. I was still gonna let you have her.
现在准备好好难过一场吧012---But now, prepare to feel bad about yourself.
我一辈子都在为那个做准备012---I've been preparing for that my entire life!
或是为了你的不礼貌012---Or something about you that's mean!
来吧  各位  开始了012---Come on, guys. Let's go.
追平比数  没时间了012---Tie score. We're running out of time.

天啊  没错  达阵得分  达阵得分012---God! Touchdown! Touchdown! Yes! Touchdown! Hey, oh!
不012---No, no, no.
闹钟响了  那一球不算012---Uh, the buzzer buzzed. It doesn't count.
在接到球之后  在接到球之前012---After the snap.   Before the snap.
之后  之前012---After. Before.
那很重要吗   对012---Does it really matter? Yes!
但我达阵得分  那是我第一次达阵得分012---But I made a touchdown. It was my first touchdown.
菲比  那真的很棒  可惜不算012---Pheebs, that's great. Doesn't count.
那一球算数  作弊鬼  霸道女王012---Does so count. Cheater, cheater, compulsive eater.
天啊012---Oh, my God!
没关系  或许你没长大  但我已经长大了012---That's fine. Maybe you haven't grown up, but I have.
好吧  去死吧012---Oh, okay. Dead leg!
好吧  你想靠作弊赢球  尽管去吧012---Okay, fine. You want to win by cheating, go ahead.
达阵得分算数  你们赢了012---The touchdown does count. You win.
不012---Whoo! Yay! - No!
我不要再这么做  我要你输得无话可说012---I won't do this again. I wanna beat you when you can't blame it...
鼻子断了  铃声响了  或你可能白血球过多012---...on the broken nose or the buzzer or the fact that you might have mono.
就说双方平手  现在是中场休息012---Let's just call this tie score and it's halftime.
首先我不跟作弊的人比赛012---First, I don't play with cheaters.
其次你知道我的扁桃腺肿了起来012---Second of all, you know I had swollen glands!
你知道吗   我想你会玩的012---You know what? I think you'll play.
真的吗   为什么012---Oh, really? Why's that?
因为赢的人可以拿到这个012---Because the winner gets this.
盖勒杯012---The Geller Cup!
大家都看到  那个钉在木板上的丑娃娃了吗012---Is everybody else seeing a troll doll nailed to a two-by-four?
啊哦012---Mm-hm.
好吧  太好了012---Okay, good.
好了  它怎么会在你手上012---Okay, where the hell did you get that?
你到医院去接鼻梁的时候…012---When you went to the hospital for your nose...
我游到湖里把它捞出来的012---...I swam into the lake and fished it out.
奖杯是我的012---That cup is mine!
不  才不是  想要把它带回家  你就得赢球012---No, it's not. You want it, you're gonna have to win it.
我们不吃晚餐了吗012---So are we not having dinner at all?
来吧  开始了  认真点  小组会议012---Come on, let's go. It's time to get serious. Huddle up.

如果我在带球时扑倒钱德  你能专心一点吗012---If I take Chandler out of the running, will you be able to focus?
你打算怎么做   确定让他接到球012---What are you gonna do?  Just make sure he catches the ball.
其他的交给我来办012---I'll do the rest.
来吧  胆小鬼  好了  来吧012---Come on, you wuss! Okay, come on.
快跑  钱德  我来接012---Go, Cha... Chandler. I got it!

小心012---Look out! - Oof!
哇啊哦012---Whoa, whoa.
被女生擒抱  这种画面不多见吧012---Tackled by a girl! Bet you don't see that every day.
你这是干嘛012---Whoa, whoa, whoa! What's with the tackling?
干嘛012---What?
我碰他一下  他就倒下来了012---I just touched him and he went over.

你怎么会有那个012---Where'd you get that?
我跑的好远012---I went really long.
42比21012---Forty-two to 21.
跟火鸡一样  罗斯输了012---Like the turkey, Ross is done!
你先挑队员  所以你那队的实力比较好012---You got to pick first, so you got the better team.
太可悲了  你不肯承认我们赢球012---Pathetic! Why can't you just accept that we're winning...
因为我比你厉害012---...because I'm better than you?
说得太有道理了  好一声叹息012---Pfft!  Oh, what a great argument. Exhaling!
好吧  我要让你心服口服012---All right, I'll prove it to you. Okay?
我用乔伊跟你换瑞秋  我还是能赢012---I'll trade you Joey for Rachel and I'll still win the game.
什么  男生对女生012---What? The guys against the girls?
太可笑了  我只落后三记达阵得分012---That's ridiculous because I'm only down by three touchdowns.
那就得分给我看啊012---Oh, then bring it on!
除非你害怕会输给几个女生012---Unless you're afraid you might lose to a bunch of girls.
好吧  瑞秋  你到摩妮卡那边  乔伊  你跟我一队012---Fine. Rachel, you're with Monica. Joey, you're with me.
你竟然把我交换出去012---I can not believe you're trading me.
我们也来尝尝看赢球的滋味012---Let's see what it's like to be on a winning team for a change.
你会让我摸球吗012---You're gonna let me play?
那么好吧012---All right, then!
比赛结束了吗  我们要吃饭了吗012---The game is over? We eat now?
不  比赛还没有结束  我们在交换队友012---No, the game's not over. We're switching teams.
钱德发现我太厉害了  还是跟他同一队比较好012---Chandler finds me so intimidating that it's better if we're on the same team.
好吧  开始了012---Okay, let's play. Let's go.

其他荷兰人呢012---And the, uh, other Dutch people?
他们来自荷兰  对吧012---They come from somewhere near the Netherlands, right?
少唬人了012---Nice try.
荷兰是虚构的地方012---The Netherlands is this make-believe place...
彼得潘跟小仙女住在那里012---...where Peter Pan and Tinker Bell come from.
天啊012---Oh, my.

不  我不要跟这家伙同队012---No. No, I'm not playing with this guy.
我没意见  我受够了012---Oh, fine with me. I've had enough of this.
我们就废话少说了  海蒂  你喜欢我的哪个朋友012---Let's just cut to the chase. Heidi, which of my boys do you like?
你在做什么   你在做什么012---What are you doing? What are you doing? Shh, shh.
我喜欢哪一个012---Which do I like?
对  约会  打打闹闹  带他回你的风车012---Yeah, for dating, general merriment, taking back to your windmill?
如果一定要现在选…012---Well, if I had to choose right now...
对了  我也觉得不可思议…012---...which, by the way, I find really weird...
不过我会选钱德012---...I would have to say Chandler.
太棒了012---Yes!
等一下  她显然没听懂你的问题012---Wait a minute. She didn't understand the question.
为什么你不请虎克船长  跟他解释一下012---Why don't you have Captain Hook explain it to her?
抱歉  那是我的真心话012---I'm sorry. That is my truth.
你听到了吗   那是她的真心话 "我让你追她"先生012---You hear that? That is her truth, Mr. "I'll Let You Have Her"!
我赢了  你输了  我是最棒的012---I win! You suck! I rule all!
帮我跳迷你波浪舞庆祝一下012---Mini-wave in celebration of me!
我想我的答案要改成  "我谁都不要选"012---I am now thinking I would like to change my answer to "no one."
什么012---What?
我发现你很肤浅012---I now find you shallow, and, um...
是个呆瓜012---...a dork.
再见012---Bye-bye.
干得好012---Heh. Nice going.
你害自己几个月没有性生活012---You just saved yourself a couple months of sex.
那不重要   因为她选了我012---It doesn't matter, because she picked me.
从现在开始   我可以去约会012---From now on, I get the dates...
星期六晚上  你只能待在家里看烹饪节目012---...and you stay home on Saturday nights watching Ready, Set, Cook!
别说了  时间急迫012---Save the breakthroughs for therapy. The clock is ticking.
我们没时间了  我们输给女生012---We have no time, and we are losing to girls.
我们不会输给女生012---We're not gonna lose to girls.
现在比数是42比21012---It's 42-21!
该死  刚刚我还赢那么多012---This sucks! I was just up by that much!
我们到底要不要比赛  来吧  你们这些娘娘腔012---Are we playing football or what? Come on, you hairy-backed Marys!
我们非赢不可  我们为全世界的女人而战012---We have to do this. We're playing for women everywhere.
想像你们的每一次烂约会012---Think about every lousy date you ever had.
每次亲热时  男人的眼睛都盯着电视看012---Every guy who kept one eye on the TV while you were making out.
天啊  你也跟装了玻璃假眼的男人约会012---Oh, my God. You dated someone with a glass eye too?
加油  好吗  这都是为了女人  痛宰他们012---Come on, okay? This is for all womankind. Let's kill them!
对  痛宰他们012---Yeah! Kill them!
好吧  我也想痛宰他们012---All right, I want to kill them too.
但他们是男生012---But they're boys.
我们该怎么打败三个男生012---You know, how are we gonna beat three boys?
还有一分钟半  我们落后两分012---A minute and a half left, and we're down by two points.
两分  姊妹们012---Two points, ladies.
菲比  你再做后转身进攻012---Phoebe, you do a buttonhook again.

你少了五码  所以…012---So you're five feet short. So...
我们赢了012---...ha-ha-ha, we win! - Whoo!
太棒了012---Yes, yes, yes!

让我来   不行  放手012---Let me in! Let me in! No way! Let go!
放手  我只是个小女孩012---Let go? I'm a tiny little woman!
两位  好了  今天是感恩节012---Guys, come on, it's Thanksgiving!
输赢不重要012---It's not important who wins or loses.
重点是那个荷兰女孩选了我012---The important thing is the Dutch girl picked me!
她选了我  不是你  荷兰爱钱德  谢谢阿姆斯特丹  晚安012---Me, not you! Holland loves Chandler! Thank you, Amsterdam! Good night!
哇012---Ow!
我们应该多抽空玩足球012---We should play football more often.

放手  不  你才要放手012---Let go! No, you let go!
为什么每次都是只剩 我们两个人抱着球不放012---How come it's always us left holding the ball?
我不知道  我想其他人就是不在乎012---I don't know. I guess the other people just don't care enough.

挂上一堆金箔和闪灯012---...in, like, tinsel and twinkly lights.
你晚上怎么睡得着呢012---Hey, how do you sleep at night?

菲比  听我说012---Hey, Phoebe, listen.

放在这里怎么样012---What if you put them here?
知道吗  这倒是个好主意  离马克杯比较近012---You know, that's actually a good idea. They'll be closer to the mugs.
你知道吗  你该要求其他服务生也那么做012---You know what? You should have the other waitresses do that too.
他们早就那么做了012---They already do. Huh?
所以他们叫这里是托盘区012---That's why they call it "the tray spot."
我常听到他们那么说  我以为那是他们去玩的夜店012---I always heard them talk about that. I just thought it was a club they went to.

我想辞职  又觉得该坚持下去012---Oh. I wanna quit,but then I think I should stick it out.
我又觉得…012---Then I think...
为什么要做这种  有损尊严的工作012---...why would such a person stay in such a demeaning job...
难道只因为这份工作  和我的兴趣有一点点关系吗012---...just because it's remotely related to the field they're interested in?

他周末会打给我  看是否能安排面试012---...and he's gonna call me this weekend to see if he can get me an interview.
我知道012---Wow. Ha, ha. I know.
这个人无缘无故帮你012---What, so this guy's helping you for no apparent reason?
完全的陌生人012---And he's a total stranger?
对  他叫马克什么的012---Yeah. His name is, um, Mark something.
听起来  马克另有所图012---Ah. Sounds like "Mark Something" wants to have some sex.
什么012---What?
我的意思是  为什么无缘无故给你好处012---I'm just saying, why else would he just swoop in out of nowhere for no reason?
想当好人012---To be nice?
乔伊  男人会没有理由的  对女性示好吗012---Hey, Joey, are men ever nice to strange women for no reason?
不会  除非为了上床  多谢012---No, only for sex. Thank you.
你有和马克提到我吗012---So did you tell Mark Something about me?
不需要  因为我穿着"我爱罗斯"的广告板012---I didn't have to, because I was wearing my "I Heart Ross" sandwich board...
而且摇着铃012---...and ringing my bell.
乔伊  生日快乐012---Joey! Happy birthday!
嘿012---Hey!
好吧  你跟多少女生交往012---Okay, how many of that girl are you seeing?
你想哪儿去  那些是乔伊的姊妹012---How hammered are you? Huh? These are Joey's sisters.
嗨  乔伊的姊妹012---Hi, Joey's sisters.
嗨  你好012---Hey.  Hey. Hey.
你在喝什么012---What are we drinking over here?
伏特加加小红莓汁012---Oh, well, I have a vodka and cranberry juice.
真的012---No kidding?
我干掉我先生后  喝的就是这个012---That's the exact same drink I made myself right after I shot my husband.
好吧  我不知道该怎么跟你说话012---Okay, I don't know how to talk to you.
你在干嘛012---What are you doing?
把我前任女友的快速拨号键删除012---I'm taking my ex-girlfriend off my speed dialer.
不  这是好事012---No, no, no, it's a good thing.
我们要快速拨号干嘛  干嘛赶来赶去的012---Why must we dial so speedily anyway? Why must we rush through life?
为何不珍惜美好的时光  你的胸部真大012---Why can't we savor the precious moments? Those are some huge breasts you have.
嗨  嗨012---Hi. Hi.
我听说了瑞秋今天遇见那个叫马克的家伙了012---Yeah, heh. So, um, I heard about this Mark guy that Rachel met today.
对  不是很棒吗   是啊012---Oh, yeah, isn't that great? Oh, yeah.
很不错  他听起来是个好人012---So, uh, yeah, pretty good.He sounds like a nice, good guy.
的确  他简直太完美了012---Oh, he is. And he is so dreamy.
你知道吗  他走了以后  我还说…012---I mean, you know what?When he left, I actually used the phrase...
哈米娜…012---..."homina, homina, homina."
好极了012---That's excellent.
所以他只是个好人012---So he's just a nice guy.
你真觉得  马克是不求回报的帮你012---You really think this Mark doesn't want anything in exchange for helping you?
也许我该陪他洗个鸳鸯浴012---Well, I assume I'll have to take showers with him.
不过哪份工作不是这样012---But, you know, that's true of any job.
感觉如何012---How you feeling?
我的公寓不见了012---Well, my apartment isn't there anymore...
因为全被我喝光了012---...because I drank it.
你去哪儿  你拆了礼物之后  我们就找不到你了012---Where'd you get to? We lost you after you opened up all the presents.
对  我躲到储藏室  而且不只我一人012---Yeah, I ended up in the storage room,and not alone.
真的012---Really? Aah.
别叫了  别叫了012---No "woo-hooing." No "woo-hooing."
怎么了  出了什么事012---Why, what happened?
我跟乔伊的姐妹瞎搞012---I fooled around with Joey's sister.
那还不是最糟的部分  还有更糟的吗012---Well, that's not the worst part. What is the worst part?
我不记得是哪一个妹妹012---I can't remember which sister.
看到了吗   别说男人有好的012---You see what men do? Don't tell me men are nice.
这就是男人012---This is men.
你疯了吗012---Are you insane?
乔伊会杀了你  他真的会让你死得很惨012---Joey's gonna kill you.He's actually going to kill you dead.
你以为我没想过吗012---Okay. You don't think I thought of that?
你怎会不知道是哪一个  真令人难以置信012---How can you not know which one? I mean, that's unbelievable.
是吉娜吗   吉娜是哪一位012---I mean, was it Gina? Which one is Gina?
褐色蓬蓬头  戴飞机耳环的012---The dark, big hair,with the airplane earrings.
不  那不是吉娜  那是迪娜  你们看  连你们也分不清012---No, no, no, that's not Gina, that's Dina. See? You can't tell which is which either. Blah.
但我们没和她们瞎搞012---We didn't fool around with any of them. Blah. Blah.
薇若妮卡  一定是她  穿红色裙子的012---Veronica. Look, it's gotta be Veronica.The girl in the red skirt.
我确定我有把舌头伸进她嘴里012---I definitely stuck my tongue down her throat.
那个是我012---That was me.
喝了酒以后  我有时会太热情012---Oh. When I've been drinking, sometimes I tend to get overly friendly.
对不起  没关系012---And I'm sorry. That's okay.
不要紧  没关系012---That's all right. That's okay.
可以跟你谈谈吗012---Can I talk to you for a second?
嗨  乔伊  嗨012---Hey, Joey. Hey.
过来012---Come on.
不能在这里谈吗   这里有人作证012---Why can't we talk in here,with witnesses?
我刚和我妹妹通过电话   哪一个012---I just got off the phone with my sister. Uh, which one?
玛莉安琪拉   玛莉安琪拉012---Mary Angela. Mary Angela.
对   这又是哪一个012---Yeah. Now, which one is she again?
问钱德   他和她厮混过012---Ask Chandler.He's the one who fooled around with her.
她告诉我  你说你有可能会爱上她012---She told me you said you could really fall for her.
是真的  还是你利用她忘掉珍妮丝012---Now, is that true, or are you just getting over Janice by groping my sister?
一定是前者012---It's gotta be the first one.
真的吗012---Really?
太好了012---That's great.
你和我妹妹   坐在同一棵树下012---You and my sister, sitting in a tree.
没错  我在树下012---Yep, I'm in a tree.
他打来了吗   马克来电了吗012---Did he call? Did Mark call?
没有  亲爱的  我很抱歉  但周末还没结束012---No, honey, I'm sorry. But the weekend's not over yet.
我的老天  那是菲比吗012---Oh, my God. Is that Phoebe?
大概约会回来了012---Guess they're back from their date. Ah.
音乐  非常好012---Music. Very nice.

你今天好吗012---So how are you?
我很好  完成一本书   真的吗   关于什么的012---I am good. I finished my book. Oh, yeah? What's it about?
不记得了  你想散散步吗012---I don't remember.Do you wanna take a walk?
好啊012---Yeah, I do.
"亲爱的玛莉安琪拉012---"Dear Mary Angela:
你好吗012---Hi, how's it going?
这是我写过最难以下笔的信"012---This is the hardest letter I've ever had to write."
你是怎么搞的  乔伊会怎么反应…012---What the hell's the matter with you? How do you think Joey's gonna react...
当他发现你写信跟她妹妹分手012---...when he finds out you blew off his sister with a letter?
到那时你就告诉他  我搬到法国去了…012---That's the part where you tell him that I moved to France...
但其实我会在古巴012---...when actually I'll be in Cuba.
听着  你得自己来  好吗012---All right, look, look,you've got to do this yourself, okay?
亲自去  至少你已经知道她的名字012---In person. At least you know her name.
只要到他们家找玛莉安琪拉就行了012---You just go to the house and you ask for Mary Angela, okay?
不管到门前的是哪一位…012---When whichever one she is comes to the door...
带她去走走  好好谈谈012---...take her for a walk,you let her down easy.
好012---Okay.
万一是她来开门  而我还要求找她呢012---What if Mary Angela comes to the door and I ask for Mary Angela?
你会在古巴的哪里012---Where in Cuba?
乔伊  你怎么在这里012---Joey, what...? What are you doing here?
等外婆把我的衣服洗好012---Waiting for my grandma to finish my laundry.
那你呢012---What about you?
我来找玛莉安琪拉012---Uh, I'm here to see Mary Angela.
你真是男子汉  进来012---You are so the man. Come on.
注意听012---Now, look, listen. Listen.
你得保持沉着  因为我外婆不晓得你们俩的事012---You gotta be cool, because my grandma doesn't know about you two.
最好别把她惹毛012---You do not wanna tick her off.
她是第六个在墨索里尼尸体上吐痰的人012---She was, like, the sixth person to spit on Mussolini's hanging body.
真的012---Yeah.
玛莉安琪拉呢012---Where's Mary Angela?
就在里面  好012---She's right in there. Okay.
嗨  钱德  嗨  钱德012---Hey, Chandler.
我不敢相信  马克居然没打来  都礼拜天了还没消息012---I can't believe Mark didn't call.It's Sunday night and he didn't call.
真可惜012---Bummer.
对  看看你  简直开心死了012---Yeah, right. Look at you.You're practically giddy.
不  我很遗憾马克没有帮到你012---No, I'm genuinely sorry the Mark thing didn't work out.
听着  瑞秋  我也希望你顺利012---Look, Rach,I want only good things for you.
等等  你为什么不打给他012---Wait a minute.Why don't you just call Mark?
谁规定你只能被动等待012---Who says you have to sit here and wait for him?
你应该主动争取012---You've got to make stuff happen.
是没错  但也不能过分主动012---Yeah, but you don't wanna seem too pushy.
不会的  他把家里电话给她了012---Honey, it's not pushy.He gave her his home number.
什么  家里电话  他家里的电话012---Wha...? He gave you his home number,as in, like, to his home?
对  你不介意吧  因为你希望我顺利012---Yeah. And you don't mind if I call,because you only want good things for me.
没错  这是好事  我是这么说的012---That's right, good things.That is what I said.
哈罗  马克吗  我是瑞秋葛林012---Ahem. Hello, Mark? Hi, it's Rachel Green.
喔  不  你不需要道歉012---Ha, ha. Oh, no. Don't you apologize.
好  我等012---Yeah, I'll hold.
他把我的电话放在公司012---He left my number at work.
本来要去拿  但他得帮侄女做报告012---He was gonna get it, but he was helping his niece with her report on the pioneers.
真会扯012---Aw. That is so made up.
我  我的天  明天  真是…不  太好了012---Yeah. Oh, my God. Tomorrow? That's... No, it's perfect.
天哪  太感谢你了 太好了  再见012---Oh, God. Thank you so much.Great. Bye.
我得到面试机会了012---Oh! I got the interview.
你看吧012---Oh, yay! There you go.
他还约我吃午餐  帮我准备012---He even offered to meet me for lunch and prep me for it.
太棒了  对啊012---Oh, that is amazing. Yeah.
如果我了解马克  我想我是…012---Well, if I know Mark, and I think I do...
他应该就是那么棒  我得想想要穿什么012---...I'd expect nothing less. I gotta figure out what I'm gonna wear.
高领衫加垮裤  看起来比较专业012---High collar and baggy pants say,"I'm a pro."
好吧  回头见  好012---Yeah, right. Okay, I'll see you guys later. Woo-hoo! Okay.
你行的012---You go get them.
我对你不好吗  我有伤害过你吗012---What did I do to you? Did I hurt you in some way?
什么  "你为什么不打给他"012---What? "Why don't you call him?"
多亏你  他现在要帮她准备面试012---Well, thank you very much.Now he's gonna prep her.
帮忙准备面试  下一步就是要开除男友了012---You know, prep her, as in what you do before you surgically remove the boyfriend.
你有病啊012---Are you crazy?
有吗  有吗  我失去理智了吗012---Oh, am I? Am I? Am I out of my mind? Am I losing my senses?
这个完美男要跟我女友吃饭012---This dreamy guy is taking my girlfriend out for a meal.
罗斯  这跟你无关012---Ross, you know, this isn't even about you.
这关系到瑞秋和她的前途012---This is about Rache land something happening for her.
就算你是对的012---Uh-huh.Even if you're right.
他可能另有所图  表示他就能得逞吗012---What if he wants to sleep with her? Does that mean he gets to?
也不是  但… 你不信任她吗012---No, but... I mean, don't you trust her?
没有012---Well, yeah...
那就说服你自己  成熟点012---Then get over yourself. Grow up.
你才成熟点012---You grow up.
这提拉米苏太棒了012---This tiramisu is excellent.
是你做的吗  玛莉安琪拉  不  是我做的012---Did you make it, Mary Angela? No, I did.
真美味012---Well, it's yummy.
那玛莉安琪拉  你喜欢吗012---So, uh, Mary Angela, do you like it?
当然  这是她的最爱012---Of course. It's her favorite.
所以…012---So, um, hmm...
玛莉安琪拉  你还喜欢什么012---Mary Angela,what's your second favorite?
更多的是外婆做的提拉米苏012---More of Grandma's tiramisu.
拜托你…012---Oh, would you just please...
把食谱给我  因为它太好吃了012---...give me your recipe,because this is great.
最棒的012---It's top-notch.
食谱要跟着我上天堂   我也是012---That dies with me. So will I.
想办法到浴室来012---Excuse yourself and go to the bathroom.
我只是眯着眼睛  没有任何意思012---Oh, no, I was just squinting.That doesn't mean anything.
做就对了012---Just do it.
失陪一下  我得…012---Will you excuse me? I have to, um...
喂012---Hey...
总算  我还以为没机会和你独处  听我说句话好吗012---Finally. I thought we'd never be alone. Can I just tell you something?
派对结束之后  我满脑子都在想着你012---I have not stopped thinking about you since the party.
听着  我可能操之过急了012---Look, I may have jumped the gun here.Whoa.
我刚结束一段感情012---I just got out of a relationship.
我还没办法… 给任何人承诺012---And I'm not really in a...In a commitment kind of place.
所以呢   我也不想012---So? Me neither.
天啊  玛莉安琪拉说的没错  你的双唇真柔软012---God, Mary Angela was right.You do have the softest lips.
你不是玛莉安琪拉  不  我是玛莉泰瑞丝012---You're not Mary Angela? No. I'm Mary Therese.

没什么012---It's no big deal.
钱德吻了我  他以为我是玛莉安琪拉012---Chandler was just kissing me because he thought I was Mary Angela.
什么  你怎么会  把她当成玛丽安琪拉012---What? How could you do that? How could you think she was Mary Angela?
我不确定哪位是玛莉安琪拉012---I wasn't sure which one Mary Angela was.
听着  我很抱歉  好吗012---Look, I'm sorry, okay?

你好   瑞秋012---Hi, Rach.
乔伊  乔伊崔比亚尼012---Uh, Joey? Joey Tribbiani?
听好  乔伊  有个问题  领舞的舞者刚打来012---Listen, Joey, I got a problem. I just got a call from my dance captain.
他的感情触礁了  所以没法脱身012---He's having a relationship crisis and can't get out of Long Island.
这表示面试取消了吗012---So does that mean the audition's off?
乔伊  既然你是这里最有经验的人012---Listen, Joey, seeing as you've got the most experience...
就由你来教其他舞者舞步012---...I want you to take these dancers and teach them the combination.
什么012---What?
乔伊  拜托  这很简单012---Oh, Joey, come on, it's easy.
就手  头012---You know, it's hand, hand, head, head...
侧跨  侧跨012---...up, pas de bourree, pas de bourree...
转身  抬腿  跳跃012---...big turn here, rond de jambe, sissonne, sissonne...
滑步012---...slide, step, step...
手张开012---...and jazz hands.
就跳几步  然后手张开012---So that's steppity-step and jazz hands.
好好玩012---Have fun.
再见012---Bye.
你好   你好012---Hey.  Hey.
你在包装什么012---What are you wrapping? Oh.
要送胡立欧的012---Look what I got Julio.
是只瓶子   是啊012---Yeah, it's a vase. Yeah.
就跟诗里的一样012---Just like the one in the poem.
对  但跟诗里的不一样012---Yeah, well, not exactly like the one in the poem.
什么意思012---What do you mean?
记得你说过  你对诗不在行吗012---Remember how you said you were really dense about poetry?
对012---Yeah.
我不过是只没有内涵的瓶子  是吗  什么012---So I'm just an empty vase, huh?  What?
我是没读过什么名著012---So I don't read as many important books as you do.
也不会写些指桑骂槐的诗012---I don't write poems that seem to be about one thing but are about something else.
而且我又很容易  对平凡事物就心动012---And you know what? I get excited about stupid stuff...
像是礼拜六《时人杂志》送来时012---...like when my People magazine comes on Saturday...
新的《应有尽有》目录寄来时012---...and the new Hold Everything catalog.
但那不表示  我没有内涵012---But that does not mean I'm empty.
我有心  我对朋友和家人有心012---I care about things. I care about my friends and family.
你没资格这样评断我012---You have no right to make that judgment about me.
你根本不了解我012---You don't even know me. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
我写的那首诗不是在写你012---The poem is not about you.
什么  《空瓶》不是在写你012---What? "The Empty Vase" is not about you.
我的宝贝012---My baby preciosa.
被你误解真让我伤心012---You make me so sad that you would think this.
抱歉  是我朋友菲比说的   不012---I'm sorry. It's... My friend Phoebe said... No, it's...
我是在描写天下所有的女人012---It's about all women.
全美国的女人012---Well, heh, all American women.
这让你比较好受吗012---You feel better now?
是喔012---Oh, yeah.
好   来吧012---All right, let's do it.
不对   不对啦012---No, no, no.
这什么东西012---What was that?
我了解  但他们只能做到这程度012---I know, it's the best I could get out of them.
各位   各位012---Well, people. People, people, people.
再来一遍  这遍大家看着乔伊跳012---Let's try it again. And this time, let's everybody watch Joey.
你来示范正确动作012---Show them how it's done.
弹琴   麦克012---Count it off, Mack.
昨晚婚前单身派对  玩得愉快吗012---So did you have fun at the bachelor party last night?
愉快   给你看个东西012---Oh, yeah. Yeah. Look what I got.
你看   她都有穿喔   对012---See, she's fully dressed, right? Right.
按一下后   变没穿了012---And then you click it and, uh-oh, she's naked.
再按一下   又有穿了012---And then you click it again and she's dressed.
这下是事业女强人  走在大街上012---She's a business woman, walking down the street.
购物   然后又没穿了012---She's window shopping, and, oh, oh, oh, she's naked.
你好012---Hi.
你好012---Hello.
我想跟我的笔独处一下012---You know what? I'm gonna spend some alone time with the pen.
抱歉   我真蠢012---I'm sorry. I was an idiot.
大白痴  大白痴012---A big idiot. A big idiot. Heh.
只是  请你理解  马克这事  我就是无法释怀012---It's just, you have to realize, this whole Mark thing is really hard for me.
亲爱的  怎会无法释怀  我们都在一起快一年了012---Honey, why is it hard? We've been together for almost a year now.
我之前跟卡萝在一起八年  都还是分了012---Well, I was with Carol for like eight years, and I lost her.
而对你   我似乎爱得更多012---And now, if it's possible, I think I love you even more.
所以我不由得会往坏处想012---So it's hard for me to believe I'm not gonna...
总觉得有人会抢走你012---Well, that someone else isn't gonna take you away.
让我当那个人012---Let it be me. Let it be me.
亲爱的  你这话好动人012---Honey, that's very sweet.
但我是这么想  两个人如果真心相爱012---It just seems to me, though, that if two people love each other...
又互相信赖  跟我们一样012---...and trust each other, like we do...
那就没必要吃醋012---...there's no reason to be jealous.
我要走了  再见  钱德012---I gotta get going. Bye, Chandler.
好   罗斯012---Oh, okay, Ross.
这笔有点无聊了  帮我买些色情书刊好吗012---Listen, this pen's getting kind of boring, so can you pick me up some porn?
你去哪   我去接小班012---Where you going? I've gotta go pick up Ben.
跟他约好了  下午要陪他玩012---We've got a playdate this afternoon.
还有谁012---Oh. With who?
就昨晚在派对上  认识的女孩012---Just this woman I met last night at the party.
有女孩012---There was a woman at?
是说脱衣女郎012---The stripper?
对012---Yeah.
你跟脱衣女郎有约012---You have a playdate with a stripper?
还真该弄个小孩来012---Man, I gotta get a kid.
对啊012---Uh, yeah, yeah.
就她那个以后  我们就聊开了012---We started talking after she, you know, did her thing...
刚好她也有个儿子  跟小班一样年纪012---...and it turns out she's got a boy about Ben's age.
所以我们要一起带去  上儿童体操课012---So we're gonna take the kids to a Gymboree class.
可以吗  当然  她结婚没012---Is that okay? Sure. Is she married?
没012---No. Huh.
你在吃醋吗012---Are you jealous?
没啊  只是不懂她  非找你不可而已012---No. You know, I just don't see why she has to play with you, that's all.
难道她没有012---I mean, doesn't she, you know...
其它一样做脱衣舞的朋友吗012---...have any other stripper-mom friends of her own?
你明明就是在吃醋  我没在吃醋  好吗012---You are totally jealous. Ugh. I'm not jealous, all right?
这是跟…012---This is about...
人们对某种…012---...um, people feeling certain things...
像是…012---...you know, about...
对脱衣女郎的感受012---...strippers. - Oh.
而且   亲爱的  我也爱你012---And, you know... And, um... I... Ugh. Honey, I love you too.
再见  等等012---Bye. Wait, wait, wait.
哈012---What?
这吻他肯定好几小时  忘不了012---Well, there's a kiss he won't forget for a few hours, you know?
对012---Yeah. Ha, ha.
不然的话就是你引起他的性欲  再把他送到脱衣女郎手上012---Either that or you just turned him on and sent him off to a stripper.
这里有位叫胡立欧的吗012---Is there a Julio here?
我就是012---I am Julio.
做作先生012---Mr. Pretentious
你自以为了不起012---You think there's no one finer
你的诗卖不出去  只能在餐馆上班012---Well, your poems are unpublished And you work in a diner
你也不是上帝赐给女人的礼物  全是你的想像012---You're no God's gift to women. That's all in your head
你不过是个浑球012---You are just a butt-munch
浑球惹人厌012---No one likes a butt-munch.
床上表现也很差012---And you're also bad in bed
嘿012---Hey.
总共六块钱012---Six dollars, please.
六块  我只租了一晚  应该是三块012---Six? I just had it for one night. It's 3.
是到八点  现在已经八点零二分了012---Eight o'clock is the cutoff. And, oh, it's 8:02.
我觉得你有太多权力了012---You know, in a weird way, you have too much power.
你得帮帮我  因为我只有三块012---Look, you're gonna have to help me out here because I only have 3.
我可以帮你012---I can help with that.
天啊  理查012---Oh, my God. Richard?
你好  你好012---Hi.  Hi.
你的胡须剃掉了012---Wow. Your lip went bald.
谢了012---Thanks.
你看起来很棒012---So you look great.
是啊012---Yeah, right. Ha, ha.
是真的…012---No, you do. You...
你… 怎样012---You just... You... What?
你有条内裤粘在腿上012---You got panties stuck to your leg.
因为我刚刚从干衣机收衣服012---Ahem, that's because I was just grabbing some things out of the dryer...
静电的关系012---...and static cling. Ha, ha.
不然就是上帝知道  我会撞见你012---Or maybe it's just because God knew I'd be running into you...
看到这个大好机会012---...and saw an opportunity.
很高兴看到你012---It's good to see you.
我也很高兴看到你012---It's good to see you too.
《老友记》 第三季  第13集  摩妮卡和理查只是朋友012---Friends S03E13  The One Where Monica and Richard are Just Friends
有看到那个家伙吗  他在经典区… 谁012---See that guy? He's in "Classics" now... Who?
但我们一离开  他就会去A片区012---...but you know as soon as we leave, he's going straight to the porn.
他会租《大国民》…012---He's gonna go up to the counter with Citizen Kane...
《迷魂记》和《发条橘子》012---...Vertigo and Clockwork Orgy. Ha, ha.
太棒了012---This is nice.
对   我怀念这个012---Ha, ha. Yeah. I miss this.
我也是012---Me too.
你想去吃点汉堡吗012---So you wanna get a hamburger or something?
我不知道这样好不好012---Aw, um, I don't know if that's a good idea.
只是朋友   我保证不会偷摸你012---No. Just friends. I won't grope you. I promise.
我觉得太快了012---Yeah, I think it's too soon.
不会太快  我十一点吃的午餐012---No, it's not too soon. I had lunch at 11.
好啊   宝贝012---Yeah, baby.
你在干嘛  做巧克力牛奶  要来一点吗012---What are you doing? Making chocolate milk. You want some?
不用  我已经二十九岁了012---No, thanks. I'm 29.
天啊  我得去上班了012---Oh, my God. I gotta go to work.
你今天会几点下班012---What time do you think you're gonna get off tonight?
我不知道  可能会很晚012---I don't know, honey. It could be really late.
不会吧  又来了012---Oh, come on. Not again.
我知道  对不起  我跟你打个商量  好吗012---Oh, I know. I'm sorry. Listen, I'll make a deal with you, okay?
只要我下班回家…012---Mm. Every night that you're asleep...
而你已经睡了… 嗯012---...before I get home from work... Yeah.
我会用过去很受欢迎的方法  叫你起床012---...I will wake you up in a way that has proved very popular in the past.
如果你得晚下班  我一定会支持你012---Well, now, if you need to stay late, I want to be supportive of that.
谢谢012---Thank you.
嗨   嘿  菲比012---Hi. Hey, Pheebs.
嗨   嘿012---Hi. Hey.
看看你  你什么时候  开始溜直排轮了012---Look at you. Since when do you Rollerblade?
明天开始012---Oh. Since tomorrow.
我在公园  遇见一个很可爱的家伙012---I met this really cute guy in the park.
他喜欢慢跑  溜直排轮和游泳  所以我们交换条件012---And he, like, you know, jogs and blades and swims, and so we made a deal.
他会教我做些运动012---He's gonna teach me how to do all sorts ofjock stuff.
那你会替他做什么  我会让他教012---And what are you gonna do for him? I'm gonna let him.
好吧 很好012---Okay. Cool.
早安  嘿012---Morning. Hey.
有人昨晚很晚回来喔012---Somebody got in late last night. Ahem.
嗯  我撞见理查012---Yeah, well, I ran into Richard.
什么时候的事  大约八点零二分012---When did this happen? Oh, um, around 8:02.
我们聊了一会…012---And we, uh, talked for a little while...
然后去吃纯友谊汉堡012---...and then, um, we went out for an innocent burger.
噢  没有什么  所谓的纯友谊汉堡012---Oh, there's no such thing as an innocent burger.
你会再见他吗  明天晚上012---Are you gonna see him again? Tomorrow night.
摩妮卡  你在干嘛012---Monica, what are you doing?
她花了六个月的时间  忘记他…012---Well, she spent the last six months getting over him...
现在用跟他约会  来庆祝012---...and now she's celebrating that by going on a date with him.
这不是约会  好吗012---It's not a date, okay?
我只是教他做  带到朋友家派对的千层面012---I'm just gonna teach him how to make a lasagna for some potluck dinner he has.
你可能会想要多做一点  因为…012---Well, you might want to make a little extra because, you know...
做完爱之后  可能会肚子饿012---...you'll probably be hungry after the sex. Mm.
我们不会做爱的012---We're not gonna have sex.
懂吗  情况没有改变012---Okay? Nothing's changed here.
他还是不想要小孩  而我想要012---He still doesn't want children, and I still do.
所以我们会当朋友012---So that's why we're gonna just be friends.
脱衣服的朋友012---Naked friends.
嘿  你有冰块吗  嘿012---Hey. Do you have any ice? Hey.
看冷冻库有没有012---Check the freezer.
如果里面没有  大概是用完了012---If there's none in there, we're probably out.
你才刚下班吗  很晚了012---Are you just getting home from work? It's late.
是啊  但我今天过得很棒012---Yeah, I know. I had the greatest day, though.
我今天跟卡文克莱的业务代表开会012---I got to sit in on a meeting with the reps from Calvin Klein.
我跟我老板说我喜欢睡衣系列  她就订了一堆012---I told my boss I liked this line of lingerie, she ordered a ton of it.
你今天过得怎样012---How was your day?
我发现我可以只用舌头  数出我有多少牙齿012---I discovered I'm able to count all my teeth using just my tongue.
为什么你的冷冻库有《鬼店》012---Why do you have a copy of The Shining in your freezer?
我昨天晚上看到很害怕  所以…012---Oh. I was reading it last night and I got scared, so...
放在冷冻库  你就很安全吗012---But, uh, you're safe from it if it's in the freezer?
至少安全一点012---Well, safer.
我会先确定冷冻库有位置012---I never start reading The Shining...
才会开始读《鬼店》012---...without making sure we got plenty of room in the freezer.
你多久读一次012---How often do you read it?
你难道不会重覆读某本书吗012---Haven't you ever read the same book over and over again?
嗯   我《小妇人》读过  不只一次012---Well, um, I guess I read Little Women more than once.
但那是经典名著   《鬼店》有什么好看的012---But that's a classic. What's so great about The Shining?
问题应该是  《鬼店》有什么不好看的012---The question should be, Rach, "What is not so great about The Shining?"
懂吗  答案就是 "太好看了"012---Okay? And the answer would be, "Nothing." All right?
这可是最恐怖的书012---This is, like, the scariest book ever.
我敢说一定比你的经典名著好看012---I bet it's way better than that classic of yours.
好012---Ha, ha. Okay.
再看看吧012---Uh, well, we'll just see about that, okay?
我会读《鬼店》   你来读《小妇人》012---I will read The Shining, and you will read Little Women.
好  没问题  好吧012---All right, you got it. All right?
好  好012---Okay. Okay.
瑞秋  这些小妇人  嗯012---Uh, now, Rach, these little women... Yeah.
她们有多小012---How little are they?
小得很恐怖吗012---I mean, are they, like, scary little?
钱德  罗斯  这位是罗伯  噢  你好012---Um, Chandler, Ross? This is Robert. Oh, hey.
嗨  你这里有口红印012---Hi. You have lipstick right here.
没关系  是我的  我们刚刚接吻012---Oh. Huh. That's okay, it's mine. We just kissed.
穿短裤不会太冷吗012---So isn't it a bit cold out for shorts?
嗯   我是加州来的012---Well, I'm from California.
对啊  你们有时候  会突然起火012---Right, right. Sometimes you guys just burst into flame.
我起来了  我站起来了012---I'm up. Ahem. I'm up. I've gotten up now.
有人要点什么吗012---Anybody, uh, want anything?
我要咖啡   我也是012---I'll have coffee. Yeah, me too.
总共三杯   好  罗斯  你跟我来吧012---Yeah, make that three. Okay. Ross, why don't you come with me?
好012---Okay. Ha, ha.
你是怎么了  发生什么事012---What is the matter with you? What's going on?
罗伯跑出来了012---Robert's coming out.
什么意思  他是同志012---What do you mean? What, is he gay?
不是  他…012---No, he...
他从短裤跑出来了012---He's coming out of his shorts.
什么012---What?
他的"脑袋"跑出来了012---The man is showing brain.
你确定吗   等等012---Are you sure? Hold on.
抱歉   刚刚是要咖啡和…012---Ahem. I'm sorry, you guys. That was a coffee and a...
咖啡  我们可以写下来  好012---Coffee. We could write it down. Okay.
不  不用了  不需要012---No, no. That won't be, uh... Won't be necessary.
怎样  没错…012---Well? Yeah, yeah, yeah.
该怎么办…012---What do we do? What do we do?
嗯  我想就不要直接看着那里012---Well, I suppose we just try to not look directly at it.
像日蚀一样012---Like an eclipse.
如果今晚有人赞美我的厨艺  我要说什么012---When people compliment me on my cooking tonight, what do I say?
你就谢谢他们  然后买礼物送我012---Well, you say, "Thank you very much." And then you buy me something pretty.
好了  我们要把手放到碗里…012---Come on, we're gonna put our hands in this bowl...
然后压扁蕃茄012---...and we're gonna start squishing the tomatoes.
感觉好奇怪012---Ooh, this feels very weird.
你每天都在摸眼球  这还会奇怪012---Heh. You touch people's eyeballs every day and this feels weird?
我是摸眼球012---Yeah, well, sure, I touch them.
但我也花了好几年的时间  不去压扁它们012---But I spent years learning not to squish them.
那是我的手012---That's my hand.
好   继续压吧012---Okay. Gotta keep squishing.
蕃茄被压扁了012---The tomatoes are squishing.
噢012---Oh, yeah. Oh. Oh.
天啊  你的衣服沾到了012---Oh, gosh. You got some on your shirt.
对   等等012---Yeah. Hold on a second.
倒点苏打水  马上擦一擦012---Okay, just put a little club soda on it. Get to it right away.
应该…012---It should, um, do...
有用012---...the trick.
怎么了012---What?
你的裤子上面也有012---Um, you've got some on your pants.
我会把裤子丢了012---I'll just throw them out.
这些小妇人真的…012---These little women.
你喜欢  对吧012---You're liking it, huh?
是啊   艾咪刚刚把乔的手稿烧掉了012---Oh, yeah. Amy just burned Jo's manuscript.
这样的男人一定不会原谅她的012---I don't see how he could ever forgive her.
乔是女生  是乔瑟芬的简称012---Um, Jo's a girl. It's short for Josephine.
但是乔喜欢罗瑞012---But Jo's got a crush on Laurie.
所以是女女关系罗012---You mean it's like a girl-girl thing?
因为《鬼店》就是没有  这种情节012---Because that is the one thing missing from The Shining.
不   罗瑞是男的012---No, actually, Laurie's a boy.
难怪瑞秋得读这么多遍才会懂012---No wonder Rachel had to read this so many times.
嘿   嘿012---Hey. Hey.
篮球好玩吗012---Hey, how'd the, uh, basketball go?
噢   我学会带球上篮  罚球和二十三分球012---Oh, okay. I learned how to shoot a lay-up, a foul shot, and a 23-pointer.
你是说三分球吗012---You mean a 3-pointer?
噢   我得分比较多  因为我很俏丽012---Oh, I get more because I'm dainty.
这里有没有电话   我得查看留言012---So, um, is there a phone here I can check my messages?
在后面  你要零钱吗  不用了  我袜子里都会放一点012---Yeah, in the back. Do you want a quarter? Oh, no. I always carry one in my sock.
你在干嘛  回到你自己那边…012---What are you doing? Get back over on your side of the...
哇啊012---Hello.
你好  我是乔伊  我们还没见过  嗨012---Hi. I'm Joey. We haven't met. Hi.
很高兴认识你   我是罗伯   好012---Uh, good to meet you. Robert. Okay.
怎么了012---What?
干嘛  怎么了012---What? You guys, what is going on?
你们不喜欢罗伯吗012---Do you not like Robert?
你们为什么一直在笑012---Why are you laughing?
冷静点   没必要一直想鸡蛋012---Calm down. No reason to get testy.
别这样  抱歉012---You guys. Come on. We're sorry.
只是罗伯好像  在短裤方面…012---It just seems that Robert isn't as concealed in the shorts area...
遮得不够好012---...as, uh, one may have hoped.
什么意思012---How do you mean?
嘿   嘿012---Hey. Hey.
罗伯  你可以把那些饼干  传给我吗012---Uh, Robert? Could you, uh, pass me those cookies?
当然可以012---Sure.
千层面的反应如何012---So how'd the lasagna go over?
真的吗  很好  所以你欠我三样礼物012---Really? Good. So you owe me three pretty things.
对   我也一直在想你012---Yeah. I've been thinking about you too.
不会吧  这种柏拉图恋情很不容易012---Well, no. It's hard, this platonomy thing.
什么…  有这个字啊012---What...? It's a word.
对   我真的觉得这样比较好  对  这样很聪明012---Yeah. I do think it's better this way. Yeah, we're being smart.
我很确定012---Yes, I'm sure.
你真的确定012---You really sure?
我再打回给你012---I'll call you back.
我们可以当一起上床的朋友012---So we can be friends who sleep together.
绝对可以  我们就是这样012---Absolutely. This'll just be something we do.
像打壁球一样012---Like racquetball.
对  听起来聪明又健康012---Yeah. Sounds smart and healthy to me.
我只是好奇问问…012---So, um, just out of, uh, curiosity...
你目前有其他一起打壁球的伙伴吗012---...um, do you currently have any other racquetball buddies?
只有你爸012---Just your dad.
不过是打真的壁球012---Although that's actually racquetball.
不过我有个相亲…012---You know, I do have a blind date...
下星期二   跟我妹的邻居012---...with my sister's neighbor next Tuesday.
你要我取消吗012---Do you want me to cancel it?
不用012---No.
不要  好012---No.  Yeah.
因为如果你这么做  就代表是为了我取消012---Because if you did, that means you'd be canceling for me.
而我们只是朋友  没错012---And we're just friends. Exactly.
嘿012---Hey.
嘿   噢   不要坐下012---Hey. Oh, don't sit down.
准备去打击练习场了吗  没错012---Ready to go to the batting cage? You bet.
首先  有个礼物要送你012---And first, here's a gift. Ha, ha.
哇 啊012---Oh, wow.
嘿   伸缩内裤012---Hey. Stretchy pants?
最棒的发明之一012---Well, those are the greatest things in the world.
如果我是你  一定每天都穿012---If I were you, I'd wear them every day, every day.
天啊  谢谢  你真的很贴心012---Jeez, thank you. Really, that's so nice.
但是老实说  我不认为自己会穿012---But, um, to be honest, I don't think I can wear these.
太紧了  让我觉得大家都看得到012---They're so tight. I'd feel like I'm on display.
对不起012---I'm sorry.
没关系  我可以…012---That's all right. I'll figure...
嘿   你好吗012---Hey. How you doing?
好吗   好啊012---How's it going? Good.
很好  嘿   瑞秋012---Good. Hey, Rach?
《鬼店》看得如何了  丹尼刚进去217号房012---How you doing with The Shining? Uh, Danny just went into Room 217.
接下来是最棒的部分  浴缸里死去的女人…012---Ooh. The next part's the best. When that dead lady in the bathtub...
不要说   别这样  你不要说012---No, no, no. Come on. You're gonna ruin it.
好  我用暗号说012---All right, I'll talk in code.
记得那个孩子在走廊  看到两个东西的时候吗012---Remember when the kid sees those two blanks in the hallway?
记得  很酷  对012---Yeah, that's very cool. Yeah.
所有东西和没东西  让东西变东西  对吧012---Ooh. All blank and no blank makes blank a blank-blank, right?
噢  不  还有最后012---Oh, no, no. No, the end.
杰克差点用那东西  杀掉所有人012---When Jack almost kills them all with that blank...
但在最后关头  他们逃掉了012---...but then in the last second they get away. Aw.
乔伊  我不敢相信  你竟然这么做012---Joey, I can't believe you just did that.
我不敢相信  她解读了你的暗号012---I can't believe she cracked your code.
好吧  罗瑞跟乔求婚  但是她拒绝…012---All right, okay. Laurie proposes to Jo and she says no...
虽然她还很爱他  最后他娶了艾咪012---...even though she's still in love with him. And then he ends up marrying Amy.
嘿012---Hey.
我的是个意外012---Mine was by accident.
好吧012---All right.
锅炉爆炸  毁掉饭店  杀死父亲012---The boiler explodes and destroys the hotel and kills the dad.
贝丝会死掉012---Beth dies.
贝丝… 贝丝会死掉012---Beth...? Beth dies?
是真的吗  如果我读下去  贝丝会死掉012---Is that true? If I keep reading, is Beth gonna die?
不  贝丝不会死  她不会死  对吧  瑞秋012---No, Beth doesn't die. She doesn't die. Does she, Rachel?
什么  乔伊在问你是不是毁了…012---What? Joey's asking if you've just ruined...
不是由杰克尼克逊主演  他喜爱的第一本小说012---...the first book he's ever loved that didn't star Jack Nicholson.
不  她不会死012---No. She doesn't die.
那你为什么要那么说012---Then why would you say that?
因为我想伤害你012---Because I wanted to hurt you.
噢  在这里  我的钥匙掉了012---Oh, there they are. I dropped my keys.
找到了012---Got them.
嗨012---Hi.
对不起…012---Sorry. I'm sorry.
我今天过得很不好012---You would not believe my day.
我值了两班  最糟的是…012---I had to work two shifts. And then to top it off...
我在烤东西时  连一边的假胸部都烤掉了012---...I lost one of my fake boobs in a grill fire.
你在笑什么012---What are you smiling at?
抱歉   我只是在想  你今天还可以更好012---Sorry, I was just thinking your day could still pick up.
你好012---Hello.
我超爱这种朋友关系的012---I love this friend thing.
听好  罗伯很快就会到了…012---Listen, Robert's gonna be here any second...
你们其中一人  可以跟他说吗012---...so could one of you just tell him?
拜托  现在就得说012---Oh. Please, right now.
我每次看到他都会担心  "是不是又松了  在盯着我看吗"012---No, every time I see him, it's like, "Is it on the loose? Is it watching me?"
我们不能跟他说012---We can't tell him.
不可以随便跟不太熟的人  聊他的…012---You can't go up to a guy you barely know and talk about his...
宝贝012---...stuff.
没错   即使是赞美也一样012---He's right. Even if it's to say something complimentary.
嘿   嘿012---Hey. Hey.
准备去健身房了吗012---So you ready for the gym?
里面有新的攀岩墙  我们可以互相联结012---They've got this new rock-climbing wall. We can spot each other.

嘿  我们不是要…  对  我们得去…012---Hey, don't we have to? Yeah, we got... Yeah. Mm-hm.
我觉得你人  真的很好012---I think you're really, really great.
天啊  又来了012---Oh, God. Here we go again.
为什么这一直发生在我身上   是因为我表现出什么吗012---Why does this keep happening to me? Is it something I'm putting out there?
是我的错吗  还是我有病012---Is this my fault? Or am I just nuts?
我不知道该说什么012---I don't know what to say.
老兄   这里是老少咸宜的咖啡厅  把老鼠关回去012---Hey, buddy? This is a family place. Put the mouse back in the house.
真的吗   就像其他人的公寓一样012---Really? Well, it's just like everyone else's apartment.
有房间  有墙和天花板012---It's got, uh, rooms and walls and ceilings.
我只想看看你住的地方  带我看看吧012---I just wanted to see where you live. Now give me the tour.
天啊…012---Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
这里是客厅   很棒012---Uh, this is the living room. That's nice.
好012---All right.
厨房在这里  很漂亮012---And this is the kitchen.That's real pretty.
等等  我不能看卧室吗012---Wait a minute. Don't I get to see the bedroom?
卧室   喔   就是很普通的…012---RICHARD: The bedroom. Well, it's pretty much your typical...
卧室012---...bedroom. Oh, ha, ha.
我们还在门的另一边  我没看到012---We're still on this side of the door. Ha, ha. Mm-hm. Yeah, but I didn't get to see it.
真该死  或许下次再看吧  今晚很愉快012---Oh, shoot. Maybe next time. Thanks for a lovely evening.
她是谁012---So, um, who is she?
就是我跟你说的相亲012---Oh, ha, ha. That was the blind date I told you about.
她打来  改成今天012---She called and switched it from Tuesday. Aw.
你喜欢她吗012---Did you like her?
我只是以朋友的身分问  因为我完全不介意012---And I'm just asking as a friend because I am totally fine with this.
你似乎是不介意012---Well, you seem fine.
好吧   我非常介意012---Okay, you know what? I'm not fine. I'm not.
我怎么可能不介意   听到你跟她回来012---I mean, how could I be fine? Hearing you come in with her.
她想看你的卧房012---She wants to see your bedroom.
你知道吗012---You know what?
我们可以当…012---What if we're friends...
不跟其他人约会的朋友012---...who don't see other people?
你是说专属朋友吗012---You mean like exclusive friends?
为什么不行012---Why not?
过去这礼拜实在太棒了012---I mean, this has been the most amazing week.
有那么糟糕吗012---Would it be so terrible?
即使我们是住在一起的朋友012---Even if we were friends who lived together?
或是站在其他朋友面前的朋友…012---Or maybe someday, friends who stood up in front of their other friends...
发誓一辈子当朋友012---...and vowed to be friends forever.
我们又回到原点了012---You know, we're back where we were.
亲爱的  那些我都想做  但是一切都没变012---Honey, I would love to do all that, but nothing's changed.
不对  你没有胡子了012---That's not true. You don't have a mustache.
好吧  一件事情不同了012---Okay. Okay, one thing's changed.
但我们想要的东西还是不一样  结果会如何  我们都知道012---But we still want different things, and we know how this is gonna end.
你知道吗012---You know what?
我现在得离开了012---I gotta walk out of here right now.
因为忘记你  是我做过最困难的事012---Because getting over you is the hardest thing that I have ever had to do.
我不认为自己还能再来一次012---Um, I don't think I could do it again.
我知道我自己做不到012---I know I couldn't.
对012---Yeah.
那么…012---So...
打最后一场壁球如何012---How about one last game of racquetball? Hmm?
小心刺012---Watch the thorns. Ow.
怎么了012---What?
贝丝病得很重012---Beth is really, really sick.
乔也在  但我不认为  她会有办法012---Jo's there, but I don't think there's anything she can do.
乔伊   怎样012---Joey? Yeah?
你想把书放在冷冻库吗012---You wanna put the book in the freezer?
好012---Okay.
这个女的很棒012---Wow. This girl's good.
是啊  有押韵的歌词  连我都没想过012---Oh, yeah, a song with rhyming words. Ooh, I never thought of that before.
我喜欢她012---I like her.
为什么  因为她会唱歌  会弹吉他012---Why? Because she can sing and play guitar...
然后将两个结合在一起012---...and do both at the same time?
我对这些人的期望  也大概就这么多012---Well, that's pretty much all I'm looking for from these people.
看看你  好嫉妒喔012---Look at you, all jealous.
别这样  菲比 你们两人的风格完全不同012---Yeah, Pheebs, come on. You two have completely different styles.
她比较这样… 而你是…012---You know, she's more... you know? And you're more
看吧  大家都很高兴她唱完了012---Okay. See? See? Everybody else is happy she's done.
好  我下一首歌叫做012---Okay, my next song's called:
《菲比巴菲  我们说是非  我怀念012---"Phoebe Buffay, What Can I Say? I Really Loved When We Were...
搭档的过去  期许回去》012---...Singing Partners and I Shouldn't Have Left You That Way."
不会吧  又是那种  有隐藏含义的歌012---Oh, no. One of those look-for-the-hidden-meaning songs.
《老友记》 第三季 第14集  菲比的旧搭档012---Friends S03E14  The One with Phoebe's Ex-Partner
嘿   菲比012---Hey, Phoebe.
嘿   莱丝莉012---Hey, Leslie.
你怎么知道我会在这里012---How'd you know I'd be here?
我在卖大鱼的地方  撞见弗拉德…012---I ran into Vlad at the place where they sell the big fish...
他说你常在这里表演012---...and he said you played here a lot, so...
听好  我得去厕所012---All right. I have to go to the bathroom.
如果她们又提到大鱼那个地方…012---But if the place with the big fish comes up again...
我想知道是有好几条大鱼  还是只有一条大鱼012---...I'd like to know whether that's several big fish or just one big fish.
菲比说你会写广告歌012---So Phoebe tells us you write jingles.
我其实是说她抛弃我  跑去写广告歌012---Actually, I said she abandoned me to write jingles.
有没有我们听过的012---Uh, anything we might've heard of?
有012---Uh, yeah, um...
对  但是我不写了  我很厌倦012---Yeah, but I don't do that anymore. I got kind of sick of it.
也想不出好歌曲   所以被炒了鱿鱼012---And then I couldn't come up with anything good, so they fired me.
真惨012---Hmm, bummer.
其实我…012---Well, you know, I was just...
我在想说… 希望可以…012---Um, I was just thinking and just hoping that...
或许你想跟我再次搭档012---...maybe you'd want to get back together?
不要  不过谢谢你的提议012---No, but thanks.
别这样  菲比  你可不可以考虑一下012---Oh, come on, Phoebe. Would you just think about it?
好012---Okay.
不要  谢谢了012---No, but thanks.
好012---Okay, uh...
再见了  菲比012---See you, Pheebs.
真是残忍012---Wow. That was kind of brutal.
好  希望大家都能得到教训012---Well, okay. Let this be a lesson to all of you.
好吗  一旦背叛我  我就会变成冰雪女王012---All right? Once you betray me, I become like the Ice Woman.
我会非常冷淡  冷酷  绝不让步012---You know, I'm just very cold, hard, unyielding.
没有东西能穿透我冷硬的外壳012---You know, nothing, nothing can penetrate this icy exterior.
可以给我一张卫生纸吗012---Can I have a tissue, please?
好012---Oh, yes.
有人在里面吗012---Is someone in there?
没有  这只是一个冒险游戏…012---No. This is just part of a daredevil game...
叫做 "等到我膀胱爆掉死去"012---...that I play called "Wait Until the Last Moment Before I Burst and Die."
天啊  你是掉到…  你好012---Jeez, man. Did you fall...? Hi.
有吗   你有掉到哪里去吗012---So, uh, did you? Did you fall high?
有人在女厕  我等不及012---Someone was in the ladies' room. I couldn't wait.
但是我把马桶盖掀起来012---I left the lid up for you, though.  Ha, ha.
噢  阿甘  你先去吧012---You know what, uh, Gunther? Go, uh... Go ahead.
我在跟…012---I'm talking to, uh...
这时候你要说你的名字012---This is the part where you say your name.
琴吉  我在跟琴吉说话   所以…012---Ginger. Ginger. I'm talking to Ginger, so...
你不用去厕所吗  不用012---Don't you have to use the bathroom?  No.

别这样  过去的两个礼拜  你每天都加班012---Come on, sweetie. You've worked late every night for the past two weeks.
这次又是什么事  是我的错  我今天辞职了012---What is it this time? It's kind of my fault. I quit today.
但是工作优先012---But work comes first.
噢  真令人难过  怎么了012---Oh, hey. But that's sad about you, though. What happened?
发生什么事  榨干精力  精疲力竭012---What happened? Burn out? Burn all out, did you?
不是  他有更好的工作012---No, he's leaving for a better job.
噢  太好了  那么再见了012---Oh, well, that's great. So I guess this is, uh, goodbye then.

好吧  好012---Okay, then. Okay.
我们都会想你的012---Well, we're gonna miss you around here.
我也会想你们012---Yeah, me too.
星期六见  没问题012---So see you on Saturday. Yeah, you bet.

刚刚又是莱丝莉打来  看可不可以复合012---Yeah, that was Leslie calling again to see if we can get back together.
今天打了差不多二十次  祝你好运  莱丝莉012---It's like the 20th time today. Yeah, good luck, Leslie.
她一定很伤你的心吧012---Wow. She must've hurt you pretty bad, huh?
是啊  我们以前  是最要好的朋友…012---Well, yeah. You know, we were best friends...
小时候  我们两个的妈妈都在驳船上工作012---...ever since we were little. Our moms worked on the barge together.
你们两个人在驳船上跑来跑去一定很可爱012---You two must've been so cute running around on a barge.
绝不能在驳船上跑步012---You never run on a barge.
嘿   嘿012---Hey. Hey.
钱德在吗012---Is, uh...? Is Chandler around?
不在  他在咖啡厅  认识了一个女生012---No, um, he met some girl at the coffeehouse.
好像叫做琴吉012---Ooh. Yeah. Ginger something.
不…012---No.
不会吧  你确定不是  听起来像琴吉012---No, no. Uh, are you sure it wasn't something that sounded liked Ginger?
像是 "琴吉尔"012---Like, uh, "Gingeer"?
不  是琴吉012---No, it was Ginger.
我会记得是因为  他告诉我时  我说…012---I remember because when he told me, I said:
该死012---Oh, man.
我之前就是在躲那个女孩012---That's the girl I was hiding from.
她如果知道他是我室友  一定会跟他说我做了什么012---When she finds out he's my roommate, she'll tell him what I did.
你做了什么  噢  不  我不能…012---What did you do? Oh. Oh, no, no. I can't...
我不能说  那是我这辈子…012---I can't tell you that. It's like the most awful, horrible thing...
做过最糟糕的事  这样吧  不要跟我们说012---...I've ever done in my whole life.You know what? Don't tell us.
等钱德回来再说  那样比较好玩012---We'll wait till Chandler gets home because it'll be more fun.
好吧012---All right.
大概是四年前012---Okay, it was, like, four years ago.
琴吉跟我约会了几次  有个周末…012---Okay, Ginger and I had gone out a few times. Then one weekend...
我们去了她父亲的小屋…012---...we went to her dad's cabin...
就我跟她  和她烦人的小狗  胡椒012---...just me, her and her annoying little dog, Pepper. Heh.
那一晚  我煮了一道  很浪漫的晚餐…012---Well, that night I cooked this really romantic dinner...
你在食物中下毒012---You gave her food poisoning.
我还希望是如此012---I wish. No.
晚餐后  我  她和小狗  都在炉火前睡着了012---After dinner, me, her and Pepper all fell asleep in front of the fire.
我在半夜醒来  看到火快没了012---Well, I woke up in the middle of the night and I saw that the fire was dying out...
所以捡了一块木头  丢进去012---...so I picked up a log and threw it on.
至少我以为那是块木头012---Or at least what I thought was a log.
天啊  你把狗丢进去012---Oh, my God. You threw Pepper on the fire.
我希望如此012---I wish.
还有一件琴吉的事  我或许得告诉你们…012---See, I guess another thing I probably should've told you about Ginger...
她其实…012---...is that she kind of has a, uh...
装了假腿012---...artificial leg.
天啊012---Oh, my God.
乔伊  你把她的腿丢到火里之后  怎么了012---Joey. What did you do after you threw her leg on the fire?
我就跑了012---I ran.
那是我有过的最棒的吻…012---Well, that's the best kiss I've had...
至少跟在男厕认识的人是的012---...with anybody I met in a men's room.
也是我最棒的吻012---Actually, me too.
脚在水坑里  都弄湿了012---Oh. Foot in a puddle. Foot all in the puddle.
该死  我最讨厌这样了012---Oh, damn. I hate that.
我们得让你脱掉鞋子012---We're gonna have to get you out of those shoes.
噢  不用担心012---Oh, don't worry about it.
说真的  你会很冷  我不会012---No, really. You're gonna freeze. No, I'm not.
不会  你有仿生电子脚吗012---Huh. You're not? What do you got, a bionic foot?

我们独处时  你们两个可以溜掉012---So that when we... You know, it's time for our alone time, you two can split off?
他有点可爱012---You know, he's kind of cute.
你是说  他真的很可爱012---"Kind of cute" like, "really kind of cute"?
或跟你的朋友"走后门赖利"一样可爱012---Or "kind of cute" like your friend Spackle-Back Larry?
别那样叫他012---Hey, don't call him that.
他叫做"走后门哈利"012---His name is Spackle-Back Harry.
你知道吗  或许我们该出发了012---Hey, you know what? Maybe we should get going.
可洛要我们几点到012---I mean, what time did Chloe say to get there?

还记得她提过  我们能三人行的事吗012---Hey, remember when she brought up that thing about the three of us?
对  我记得可清楚了012---Yes, vividly.
她是在开玩笑的吧   我想是的012---She was kidding about that, right? Yeah, I think so.
我想应该是的012---Yeah, I think so.
天啊  如果今晚真的发生那种事  还蛮奇怪的012---God, it'd be weird if that situation presented itself tonight, huh?

她是…012---She was...
为了以防万一  我们该制订规则012---Just in case, we should come up with a set of ground rules.
对  没错012---Yeah. For sure.
好吧  第一条规则应该是012---Okay. You probably want the first one to be:
千万别张开眼睛012---"Never open your eyes."
你知道吗   因为你不会希望在做的时候012---You know? Because you don't want to be doing something...
抬头往上看吧012---...and then look up, right?
看到你不想看的事012---And see something that you don't want to be seeing.
对  好点子  太棒了012---Yeah. Good call. Nice.
等一下…012---Hold it. Hold it.
如果我闭上眼睛012---What if my eyes are closed, and...
我的手在那里012---And my hand is out there...
好吧  一定要张开眼睛012---Aah! Okay, eyes open at all times.

各自应该在…012---...you know, each would, ahem, you know...
哪个位置  对012---...be? - Right. Right.
我们可以丢铜板决定012---Well, you know, we could flip for it.
我想是吧  但正反面怎么分012---I guess. But, like, what's heads and what's tails?
如果你连那个都不知道  我不想跟你一起做这件事012---Well, if you don't know that, then I don't want to do this with you.
不  我正看着订单012---No, no, no. I am looking at a purchase order right here...
上面写得很清楚  我们订了蔚蓝海岸比基尼012---...and it clearly states that we ordered the Riviera bikini...

我在电话里说过  我没时间停下来012---...but I told you on the phone I don't have time to stop.
好吧  你不必停下来  我是隐形人  就当我不在这里012---Okay, you don't have to stop. I'm invisible. I'm not here.
对  可是我…012---Yeah, but I don't...
谁批准那笔订单的012---Who approved that order?
但我没有同事叫做马克罗宾森012---Well, there is no Mark Robinson in this office.
帮我打电话给马克  我爱马克  你认识马克吗012---Get me Mark on the phone. Ugh. I love Mark. Do you know Mark?
当然   我得查一下手边的资料012---Yeah. Let me check that with what I've got here.
好吧  038不是本店代码  038是亚特兰大的代码012---All right, see, 038 is not the number for this store. Zero-three-eight is Atlanta.
要胡椒吗012---Heh. Pepper?
我不要  好吧  抱歉012---None for me. Okay, sorry. Whoo.
抱歉  我说过分店代码搞错了012---I'm sorry. As I was saying, the store number is wrong.

你在做什么  对不起012---What are you doing? I'm sorry.
有人挂掉电话了012---But, um, hey, oh, somebody's off the phone.
要不要在火边来杯酒  我可以再生一次火012---How about a glass of wine by the fire? I can get it going again...
罗斯  你没在听  我没时间停下来012---Ross, you're not listening. I don't have time to stop.
少来了  你连十分钟都没有  我没有十分钟012---Come on, you don't have 10 minutes? I don't have 10 minutes.
苏菲  她没有十分钟吗  罗斯  我说过我没有时间012---Sophie, does she have 10 minutes? Hey, Ross. I told you, I don't.
别对我大叫  好吗  这是整个星期我们见面最久的一次012---Don't yell at me, okay? This is the most I've seen you all week.

我是说  我觉得我不像有女朋友了012---I mean, I don't feel like I have a girlfriend anymore.
罗斯  你要我怎么做012---Ross, what do you want from me?
你要我辞掉工作  让你觉得你有女朋友012---You want me to quit my job so you can feel like you have a girlfriend?
不  或许是个好点子  你得了解那只是一份工作012---No. But it would nice if you'd realize that it's just a job.
只是一份工作012---Just a job?
对012---Yes.

天啊  好吧  跟他无关012---Oh, my God. Okay, it's not.
我的天啊012---Oh, my God.
我不能老是跟你为同一件事情吵架   罗斯012---I cannot keep having this same fight over and over again, Ross.

我们说我们办不到  他说非得这么做不可012---We say we don't do that. He says, "You gotta."
你们知道吗  我们办到了012---And you know what? We did it.

不过明天我去上班的时候  八点半会顺道去你家  再见012---...but on my way to work tomorrow, I'll stop by around 8:30. Bye.
可洛  你还好吗012---Chloe, how's it coming?
你觉得我该养哪种狗012---What kind of puppy do you think I should get?
我不知道  买只大狗怎么样012---Um, oh, hey. I don't know. How about a big one?
但我的公寓很… 那就养只小狗012---But my apartment's so... Then a small one.
你得走了  等一下  我的鞋子在哪里012---We have to go. Wait! Where's my shoes?
你需要鞋子吗012---You need shoes?
为什么我们要这么赶  还记得我跟你说的女朋友吗012---Do I know why we're rushing?  You know my girlfriend?
她想跟我复合012---It turns out that she, uh, wants to get back together.
我找到了012---I found it!
我为你们感到高兴  你一定很开心012---That's so great for you guys! You must be so happy!
对  那是我现在的感触之一012---Yes, I am. One of the many things I'm feeling.
祝你跟你女朋友一切顺利   谢谢012---Good luck with your girlfriend. Oh, thank you. Ah, eh.
瑞秋012---Rachel!
你听到我的留言了吗   你还真是准时012---You got my message? You are right on time!
怎样  我能再当你的女朋友吗012---So can I be your girlfriend again?
当然可以  这样最好了012---Yes, you can. Very much.
嘿   嘿012---Hey. Hey.
为什么你在擦天花板  香蕉粘在上面了012---Why are you mopping your ceiling? Ugh, there's banana on it.
有个印第安老女人的灵魂  住在我的身体里012---I have the spirit of an old Indian woman living in mine.
那么你应该了解012---So then you know.
邮差刚好过来  我帮你把邮件拿上楼012---The mailman was here, so I brought your mail.
太好了  谢谢  法布科技是什么东西012---Oh, good. Thanks. Now, what is Fabutech?
别批评我  好吗012---Okay. Don't judge me too much, okay?
我看到广告  我发誓我从来没有012---I saw this infomercial, and, um, I swear I have never...
买过电视购物频道的东西012---...bought anything on TV before.
除了这支拖把012---Except for this mop.
但这个腿部蜜蜡除毛产品  看起来好棒啊012---But there was this stuff on leg-waxing, it looked amazing.
蜜蜡除毛  对  你看到了吗012---Waxine! Yes! Have you seen it?
太不可思议了  我想当蜜蜡除毛女郎012---It's incredible! I want to be a Waxine Girl!
我知道012---I know!
天啊  你觉得真的不痛吗  他们是怎么办到的012---God! Do you think it really doesn't hurt? How can they do that?
最近在雨林发现的有机物质012---Hello! Organic substances recently discovered in the rain forest?
那里的东西是最棒的了012---They have the best stuff in there.
天啊012---Oh, my God!
我们找不到你  还以为你跑回家跟瑞秋合好了012---We figured when we couldn't find you, you'd gone to make up with Rachel.
其实你该那么做012---Which is probably what you should have done, huh? Heh.
你说呢012---You think?
天啊  我真的好痛苦  我该怎么办012---God, I'm in hell. I mean, what am I gonna do?
瑞秋一直说我爱你  我满脑子只想着012---Rachel's all "I love you," and all I can think about...
如果我把实情告诉她  她会有什么反应012---...is what is she gonna do when I tell her what I did?
首先我们该强调一下重点012---First, we should address the more important question...
你到底有多笨呢012---...how dumb are you?
什么  听着  我们想复合012---What? Look, we're trying to rebuild a relationship here, right?
不诚实以对  还谈什么感情012---How am I supposed to do that without being total-honesty?
罗斯  我完全支持诚实以对那一点012---I'm on board about the total-honesty thing. I am.
不过会惹麻烦的事  还是少说为妙012---Just not about stuff that's gonna get you in trouble.
他说的对  这对大家没好处  你只会伤害她012---He's right. Nobody benefits, and you'll just hurt her.
到时候感情也没了012---And there won't be a relationship left to rebuild.
你不觉得…012---Don't you think...?
如果你非告诉她不可  至少等到时机成熟012---If you have to tell her, at least wait till the timing's right.
所以临终之前才要忏悔012---And that's what deathbeds are for.
好吧  太棒了012---Yeah, okay. All right.
好吧  我们得确定  她不会从别的地方知道这件事012---Okay. Now, we just have to make sure she doesn't find out some other way.
你有考虑切断关联吗012---Did you think about the trail?
什么关联012---What trail?
跟你一起做的女人012---From the woman you did it with...
到你千方百计要隐瞒的女人012---...to the woman you hope never finds out you did it!
一定要切断关联012---Always think about the trail!
我想她们没有关联012---I don't think there's any trail.
好吧012---Okay, okay.
可洛跟艾萨克是同事012---Chloe works with that guy, Isaac.
艾萨克的姊姊是洁丝敏   她跟菲比是按摩店的同事012---Isaac's sister is Jasmine, who works at the massage place with Phoebe.
菲比是瑞秋的同事  那是她们的关联  我找到了012---Phoebe is Rachel's friend, and that's the trail! I did it!
将蜜蜡涂在腿上  贴好亚麻布012---PHOEBE: "After applying the Waxine and linen strips to leg..."
好了  好的012---Did that!  Okay.
抓住亚麻布的末瑞012---"Grasp the linen strip by its tab...
快速地将它往上扯012---...and pull it off in one quick...
完全不会痛  好的012---...pain-free motion." Okay.
不是不会痛吗012---Was it not "pain-free"?
不  是痛死了012---No, it was pain-ful!
天啊  他们该叫它超痛蜜蜡除毛012---My God, they should call it "Pain-zine, now with a little wax."
广告里的女孩似乎觉得  好像不觉得有这么痛012---The girls on the commercial don't seem to think it's that bad.
因为她们笨到神经麻木了012---Because their nerves are deadened from being so stupid.
如果你不相信  自己试试看吧012---But, you know, if you don't believe me, please be my guest.
天啊012---Ow, ow, ow! Oh, my God!
你该庆幸  我们没有先贴比基尼布条除毛了吧012---Now are you glad we didn't start with the bikini strips?
可洛012---Chloe, hi.
你来质问我  拿走你手表了吗012---Is this about me taking your watch?
你拿走我的手表  抱歉  我会这么做012---You took my watch? I'm sorry. I do that.
手表送你  听着  你有跟任何人提起我们的事吗012---You keep it. Listen, did you tell anyone about us?
不  我觉得那不关别人的事012---Oh, no. I feel like it really isn't anybody's business.
没错  你什么都没跟艾萨克说吧012---Exactly. So you didn't mention anything to Isaac?
我什么事都跟艾萨克说  是吗  那当然012---Oh, I tell Isaac everything. You do? Of course you do.
艾萨克  我们没有正式介绍过012---Hi, Isaac. You know, we haven't actually met.
你超猛的012---You dog!
我想我是超猛的  听着  我刚好有女朋友012---Yes, I suppose I am a dog. But see, I happen to have a girlfriend.
对   咖啡厅的瑞秋012---Right. Rachel from the coffee place.
就是她  听着  我不想伤害她012---That's the one. Listen, I don't want to hurt her.
我了解  不论我们多爱她们012---Oh, hey, man, I know. It doesn't matter how much we love them.
一夫一妻制真的很残忍012---Monogamy is too cruel a rule.
对  听着  你能帮我保密吗012---Yeah. Listen, can you keep this information to yourself?
没问题  我们要互相关照才行012---Oh, no problem. We gotta look out for each other.
你跟我是一丘之貉012---We're the same, you and me.
其实我们不是的012---Actually, no, we're not. Heh.
对  我们就是012---Yeah, we are.
不  不是的012---No, we're not.
对  就是012---Yeah, we are.
不  不是的012---No, we're not.
好吧  不是的  对012---Okay, we're not. Right.
不过事实上就是012---But we are.
好吧  我只是要知道  你没跟你姊姊说012---Fine. I just need to know that you're not gonna tell your sister.
我可以保证不会再跟她提012---I can promise not to tell her again.
洁丝敏012---Jasmine? Uh-huh.
我们在菲比的生日派对上见过面  我是罗斯盖勒012---We met at Phoebe's birthday party. I'm Ross Geller.
你做了坏事012---You did a bad thing!
没错   非常坏012---Yes, I did. Very bad!
非常坏   对  超级坏012---Very bad. Very, very bad!
我同意你的说法012---I'm agreeing with you.
听着  你跟菲比说了吗012---Listen, did you happen to tell Phoebe yet?
还没有  好的  洁丝敏012---No. Okay. Jasmine.
求求你别跟她说012---Please. Please don't.
我非常爱我的女朋友  我希望能跟她有结果012---I love my girlfriend very much and I want to work it out with her.
好吧012---All right.
谢谢你012---Thank you. Thank you.
不过你该跟我的室友谈  因为我跟他说了  他也认识菲比012---But you should talk to my roommate. I told him, and he knows Phoebe too.
你的室友是谁012---Who's your roommate?
阿甘012---Gunther! Gunther!
请跟我说你没告诉瑞秋   我跟影印店女孩的事012---Tell me you didn't tell Rachel about me and the girl from the copy place.
对不起012---I'm sorry.
我不该说吗012---Was I not supposed to?
我们没事   没事的012---We're all right. It's okay. It's okay.
我们只是在做腿部蜜蜡除毛   是吗012---Ooh! We were just waxing our legs. Off?
我得说这是男人不懂的痛苦012---For your information, this is a pain like no man will ever experience.
你无权那么说  除非你也被踢到012---You can't make that statement unless you've been kicked in an area...
上帝要我们好好保护的地方012---...that God only meant to be treated nicely.
女人的忍痛能力就是没有男人好012---Women just have a lower threshold for pain than men, that's all.
少来了  只是蜜蜡除毛而已012---I mean, come on, it's just a little wax. Heh.
是吗  过来012---Oh, yeah? Come here.
还真是成熟012---Oh, that's mature.
现在只要把它撕下来012---So now I just pull it off? - Uh-huh.
没错012---That's right.
瑞秋  别这样  跟我说话   拜托012---Rachel, come on. Just talk to me. Please!
我连看都不想看你一眼  什么012---I can't look at you right now. What?
没事012---Nothing. Nothing.
她说一切都没事的啊  他们在说什么012---She said it was okay. What are they talking about?
离我远一点  我错了  好吗012---Just get away from me! I made a mistake, okay?
你错了 你想把你的宝贝  放在哪里  她的皮包里012---A mistake? What were you trying to put it in? Her purse?
他把他的宝贝放在哪里012---Whe...? Where did he put it?
罗斯  你跟别的女人上床012---You had sex with another woman!
天啊012---Oh, my God! - Oh...
我就知道出事了  因为昨天我的指甲没有变长012---I knew something was wrong because my nails didn't grow at all yesterday.
我猜他们吵了一架   他喝醉了012---I guess they had a fight, and he got drunk...
你们知道这件事  却没有告诉我们012---You guys knew about this and didn't tell us?
他跟女人上床  结果是我们被打头012---He has sex, and we get hit in our heads!
我要你离开  快给我滚出去  不012---I want you to leave! Get out! Now! No! No!
我要留下来好好谈谈012---I want to stay and talk about this.
好吧  她的功夫如何012---Okay! All right. How was she?
什么   她很厉害吗012---What? Was she good?
别回答那个问题012---Don't answer that.
你说你要谈的  来谈吧  她的功夫如何012---You said you wanted to talk about it. Let's talk. How was she?
她… 很可怕012---She was... Awful.
一点都不棒   超逊的  比不上你012---She was not good. Horrible. Nothing compared to you.
她不一样012---She... She was different.
好的不一样012---Good different?
没有人喜欢改变012---Nobody likes change.
住口  什么  好吧012---Just stop! What? Okay! Okay! Okay!
我们该想想办法吗012---Should we do something?
对  千万别背叛瑞秋012---Yeah. Never cheat on Rachel.
对不起  好吗  连我都讨厌我自己012---I'm sorry, okay? I'm sorry. I was disgusted with myself...
今天早上我好难过012---...and this morning I was upset...
我听到你的留言时开心极了012---...and then I got your message, and I was so happy.
我只希望她能离开我的公寓012---And all I wanted was to get her out of my apartment...
等一下012---Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Wait a minute.
你的小朋友何时离开的012---What time did your little friend leave?
天啊  当时她还在那里012---Oh, my God. She was there? She was still there?
我在那里时  她也在012---She was in there when I was in there?
听着  重点是她对我而言毫无意义012---Listen, the important thing is, she meant nothing to me.
但她却能毁了我们的关系012---And yet she was worth jeopardizing our relationship!
那时我以为我们之间完了012---I didn't think there was a relationship.
我以为我们分手了  我们只是分开一下012---We'd broken up. We were on a break.
我只知道那可能会是永远  就跟分手一样012---That, for all I knew, could last forever. That is a breakup.
你想用技术问题逃脱吗012---You're gonna get out of this on a technicality?
我没有想到逃脱012---I'm not trying to "get out" of anything.
我以为我们之间结束了012---I thought our relationship was dead.
你真的很会挑出轨时间012---Well, you sure had a hell of a time at the wake.
我想我们不该再听下去了012---I don't think we should listen to this anymore.
你在做什么  我们不能出去012---What are you doing? We can't go out.
为什么  我饿了012---Why not? I'm hungry.
他们会知道我们一直在偷听012---Because they'll know we've been listening.
天啊  我还得让阿甘来告诉我012---God! And to have to hear about it from Gunther!
少来了  我跑遍全城  只为了确定不会发生那种事012---Come on, I ran all over the place trying to make sure that didn't happen!
那真是贴心012---Oh, that is so sweet.
我想我又爱上你了012---I think I'm falling in love with you all over again.
我们可以出去  他们还有别的事要担心012---We can go out. They have other things to worry about.
我们会没事的012---We'll be fine.
瑞秋  我想告诉你  我觉得该告诉你012---Rachel, I wanted to tell you. I thought I should.
但钱德跟乔伊说服我别那么做012---And then Chandler and Joey convinced me not to!
用蜜蜡把门封住  我们永远都不要出去012---Wax the door shut. We're never leaving.
我是菲比  得有人帮我接九点的班  为雷哈克先生服务012---It's Phoebe. Someone has to take my 9:00 with Mr. Rehak...
现在是9点15分  我还没有到店里012---...because it's 9: 15 now, and I'm not there.
难道你不知道  不该发生这种事的  要不是我以为012---None of this would've happened if I didn't think...
你跟马克上床了012---...you were having sex with Mark.
好吧012---All right.
就算我跟马克上床了  你会原谅我吗012---Let's say I had slept with Mark. Would you have been able to forgive me?
我会的012---Yes, I would.
你能接受马克吻我   跟我裸体面对012---You'd be okay if Mark had kissed me and been naked with me...
和我做爱吗012---...and made love to me?
当然可以012---Yes.
如果你知道我们火烫汗湿的身体…012---If you knew that our hot, sweaty, writhing bodies were...
好吧  我会非常抓狂012---Okay. Okay, yeah. I would have been devastated...
但我还是想跟你在一起012---...but I would still want to be with you.
因为是你012---Because, I mean, it's you.
什么012---What?
快告诉我  你在想什么012---Come on, tell me what you're thinking.
我在想…012---I'm thinking...
我要叫披萨012---...I'm gonna order a pizza.
叫披萨的意思是…012---Order a pizza, like...
"我原谅你了"012---..."I forgive you"?
天啊012---Oh, man!
披萨012---Pizza?
我喜欢披萨012---I like pizza.
在披萨上面加橄榄012---Put olives on the pizza.
我们可以吃蜜蜡  它是有机蜜蜡012---We could eat the wax! It's organic!
太棒了  有毛的食物012---Oh, great. Food with hair on it.
不是吃用过的蜜蜡012---No, not the used wax.
那么做的话太疯狂了012---Because that would be crazy?
可以算我一份吗  我也饿了012---Could I get in on that? Because I'm kind of hungry myself.
好吧012---Fine.
我要订大份披萨012---Yes, I'd like to order a large pizza.
不要鳀鱼  多加些鳀鱼012---No anchovies. With, uh, extra anchovies.
没关系  我可以挑出来012---That's okay. I'll pick them off.
拜托你切一下加在酱汁里012---And could you chop some up and put it right in the sauce?
如果你要的话  最后一块给你吃012---You can have the last piece if you want.
那应该是我的披萨  你跟别人上床012---Well, I should think so. You slept with someone.
他们应该会和好  对吧012---They're gonna get through this, aren't they?
当然  少来了  他们是罗斯与瑞秋012---Yeah. Come on, it's Ross and Rachel.
他们非和好不可012---They've got to.
如果他们真的分手呢012---What if they don't?
你们觉得我需要换新走路方式吗012---You think I need a new walk?
什么012---What?
我从高中以后就用相同的方式走路012---Well, I've been walking the same way since high school.
你们知道有些人一走进来  大家会立刻注意到他吗012---You know how some guys walk into a room and everybody takes notice?
我想我得用  会引起大家注意的方式走路012---I think I need a take-notice walk.
你是认真的吗012---Are you actually saying these words?
怎么  现在你连话都不跟我说了012---What, now you're not even talking to me?
听着  瑞秋  对不起  我疯了012---Look, Rachel, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I was out of my mind.
我以为我失去你了  我不知道该怎么做012---I thought I'd lost you.
拜托  我一定是疯了  才会做出那种事吧012---How insane must I have been to do something like this?
我不会外遇  对吧  那不是我的作风  我不是乔伊012---I don't cheat, right? That's not me. I'm not Joey!
对  好吧012---Yeah, okay.
嘿012---Hey.
已经凌晨三点了  他们不知道我回家了012---It's 3 a.m. They don't know that I've come home yet.
你们注意到  他们根本没担心我在哪里吗012---You notice how they aren't wondering where I am?
对  有些人就是只想到自己012---You know, people can be so self-involved.
你知道吗  想分手的人不是我012---You know what? I'm not the one that wanted that break.
放弃的人是你  面对难关时012---You're the one that bailed. You're the one...
想要逃走的人是你012---...that ran the moment things got rough.
那是… 什么012---That's... That's what?
那跟这件事无关  好吧012---That is neither here nor there. - Here we are...
我们谈到重点了  你打算怎么办012---...in a spot again. What do you want?
你要如何处理这事   想继续努力还是逃跑012---How do you want to handle it? You want to fight for us or bail?
听着  我…012---Look, I...
我做了一件很可怕的白痴蠢事012---I did a terrible, stupid, stupid thing, okay?
对不起  我希望一切没发生过  但那是不可能的012---I'm sorry. I wish I could take it back, but I can't.
我只是不想放弃  我们之间美好的一切012---I just can't see us throwing away something we know is so damn good.
我真的很爱你012---I love you so much.
不  罗斯  不要012---No, Ross! Don't!
你不能想用一个吻解决所有问题012---You can't just kiss me and make it all go away.
行不通的  没办法解决问题012---It doesn't work that way. It doesn't just make it better.
好吗  好吧012---Okay? Okay, okay.
我想你该离开了012---I think you should go.
什么012---What?
我想你真的该离开了012---I really think you need to go now.
好吧012---Okay. Okay.
今天早上你说  没有我们解决不了的问题012---This morning you said there was nothing we couldn't work past it.
那时我又知道什么012---What the hell did I know?
我们一定有办法度过这个难关  好吗012---There's got to be a way we can work past this. Okay?
我不能想像没有你的生活012---I can't imagine my life without you.
你知道吗  没有…012---You know? Without...
没有你的手012---Without these arms...
你的脸  你的心012---...and your face and heart...
你的好心肠  瑞秋  还有…012---...your good heart, Rach, and...
不012---No.
我没办法  现在你在我心中  已经是另一个人了012---I can't. You're a totally different person to me now.
以前我相信  你永远不会伤害我012---I used to think of you as somebody that would never, ever hurt me.
永远不会012---Ever.
现在我满脑子都是  你跟她在一起的画面012---Now I can't stop picturing you with her.
我没办法  你说什么  做什么都没用012---I can't. It doesn't matter what you say or what you do.
一切都不能回头了012---It's just changed everything.
永远地改变了012---Forever.
不该是这样的012---This can't be it.
为什么会这样呢012---Then how come it is?
他们很久没说话了012---They've been quiet for a long time.
或许她杀了他012---Maybe she killed him.
我们走吧012---Let's go.
那是你的新走路方式012---Is that your new walk?
不  我快尿出来了012---No. I really have to pee.
可以给我看漫画版吗012---Can I see the comics?
这是《纽约时报》012---This is the New York Times.
好  请问我可以看漫画版吗012---Okay, may I see the comics?
你们不是要带罗斯去看比赛吗012---I thought you were taking Ross to the game.
是啊  他会来这里跟我们碰头  不会吧  瑞秋跟我们也约在这里012---We are. He's meeting us here. No, Rachel's meeting us here.
别这样  他们可以  在同一个地方出现吧012---Come on. They can be in the same room.
你真该看看昨晚的情况  怎么了012---You should've been there last night. What happened?
罗斯到我们公寓012---Ross was hanging out at our place.
瑞秋过来跟钱德  借润肤霜…012---Rachel comes to borrow moisturizer from Chandler...
你不能就只是说  来借某样东西吗012---How hard is it to say "something"?
瑞秋过来借…某样东西012---Rachel came over to borrow "something."
反正呢  她跟罗斯就开始对骂012---Anyway, her and Ross just started yelling at each other.
为什么他会对她吼  是他跟别人上床012---Why was he yelling at her? He slept with someone else.
因为他说当时  两人是暂时分开的状态012---He says they were on a break when it happened...
所以她早该原谅他了012---...so she should've forgiven him by now.
他太不讲理了吧  天啊012---He is so unreasonable. God.
不过我想我懂他的意思012---Although I understand what he means.
天啊  这好像在看《六十分钟》012---Oh, my God. This is like 60 Minutes...
开始你很气制药公司012---...when at first you're mad at that pharmaceutical company...
制造药品012---...for making the drug.
然后你又为大众感到难过…012---And then, you just feel bad for the people because...
因为他们想要长出头发来012---...they needed to make their hair grow.
特别像我父母离婚的时候012---You know, this is like when my parents got divorced.
天啊  我希望罗斯不会  在童子军活动结束后绑架我012---I hope Ross doesn't try to kidnap me after Cub Scouts.
我梦到罗斯和瑞秋没有分手012---I dreamed that Ross and Rachel were still together.
大家都聚在一起  很开心012---And we were all hanging out and happy.
我做了同样的梦012---I had the same dream.
而且没人跟那个影印女孩上床  噢  我梦到的刚好相反012---And nobody slept with the Xerox girl. Oh, I had the opposite dream.
或许之后就会没事  已过一个礼拜了012---Maybe it's gonna be okay. I mean, it's been a week.
我从来不会花  超过一个礼拜的时间为爱伤神012---It never takes me more than a week to get over a relationship.
你洗个澡就不再为爱伤神了012---It never takes you more than a shower to get over a relationship.
好  我们走吧  去看今晚的精彩表演012---Let's go. Let's hit the road. Let's get the show on it.
让我先买杯咖啡012---Let me get coffee.
我知道一间很棒的咖啡厅  离这里很近012---I know the best coffeehouse. And it's close.
比这里还近012---Closer than here?
噢  你看  我找到咖啡了012---Oh, look. I found coffee.
快走吧012---Okay, let's skedaddle.
拜托  我才不喝  别人喝过的咖啡012---I'm not gonna drink somebody's old coffee.
是的  殿下012---Okay, Your Highness.
"瑞秋  我真的很抱歉" "没关系  罗斯  你想复合吗"012---"Rachel, I'm really sorry." "Okay, Ross. Wanna get back together?"
"好啊"012---"Yeah, okay."
有人听到了吗012---Did anyone else hear that?

他在这里吗  不在012---Is he here?  No.
还给你的润肤霜012---Here's your moisturizer.
你们一定会爱死我的  听好了012---You guys are gonna love me. Okay, check it out.
我有五张星期四的票012---Thursday night, five tickets.
去看卡文克莱的内衣秀  你们都会跟我去012---Calvin Klein lingerie show, and you guys are coming with me.

他有个全新的  家庭剧院组合012---It's just, he got this new home-theater dealy...
他希望我们过去看看012---...and he wants us to check it out.
他很兴奋012---He's excited about it too.
甚至还把节目表  录在答录机上面012---He even recorded showtimes on his answering machine.
对不起  噢  没关系012---We're sorry, honey. Oh, it's okay.
瑞秋  真的不是我们不想去012---Rach, it's not that we don't want to. Really.
会有穿内衣的模特儿吗012---Are we talking models in their underwear?
跟高跟鞋012---And heels.
罗斯先问我们的  我们已经约好了012---Ross did ask us first, and we set that night aside.
没关系  是他先问的  这没什么012---Come on. If he asked you first, it's only fair.
天啊  我感觉好糟012---Oh, boy, do I feel bad.
非常糟012---Very bad.
钱德  你在干嘛012---Chandler, what are you doing? Chandler.
天啊012---Oh, my God.

其实我是昨天开始抽烟012---Well, actually, yesterday I was smoking again.
到今天还在抽012---Today I'm smoking, still.
嚼了那么多戒烟口香糖  怎么又开始抽012---Why would you start again after chewing all that quitting gum?
说真的  这跟我父母的离婚一样…012---This is just like my parents' divorce...
那也是我开始抽烟的时候012---...which is when I first started smoking.
你那时不是只有九岁吗012---Weren't you 9?
是啊012---Yeah.
午睡后的第一支烟真的是最过瘾…012---I'm telling you something, that first smoke after naptime...
太好了  我这么倒楣  一定是他012---That's great. With my luck, that's him.
他  罗斯吗012---Him? Ross?
不是  是赞美诗253篇 《爱的恩泽》012---No, "Hymn" 253: "His Eyes Are on the Sparrow."
父母离婚后  我开始用幽默来自卫012---When my parents got divorced, I started using humor as a defense mechanism.
嗨  你们这个周末有计划吗012---Hi. Uh, do you guys have weekend plans?
因为我妹说我们这个周末  可以去她的小屋  然后去滑雪012---Because my sister says we can spend the weekend at her cabin, skiing.
我先问了你们  对吧  我有遵守规则012---I'm asking you first, right? I'm playing by the rules.

钱德  你在抽烟  你在干嘛啊012---Chandler. You're smoking? What are you doing?
闭嘴  你又不是我的亲妈012---Shut up. You're not my real mom.
钱德  你可以把窗户关起来吗  我的奶头硬到可以切玻璃了012---Could you close that window? My nipples could cut glass.
真的吗  我的让我躲掉罚单012---Really? Because mine get me out of tickets.
真的很感激各位  花时间陪我012---Look, I just wanna say I really appreciate you spending time with me.
这段时间还真难熬  我只想说声谢谢012---It's been a hard time right now, so I just want to say thanks.

我们受邀去滑雪  去瑞秋妹妹的小屋012---We're, um, sort of invited to go skiing. You know, Rachel's sister's cabin?
要去整个周末012---So, for the whole weekend?
真的很抱歉  不过是她先问的012---We're really sorry, but she did ask us first.
没关系  我失恋的第一个周末…012---That's okay. If you all have to go away...
你们都要出城去…012---...for the first weekend I'm alone by myself...
我完全可以理解012---...then I totally understand.
我可以留下来   我留下来012---I can stay. I'm gonna stay.
上次去滑雪   我根本不敢跳下吊车012---The last time I went, I was afraid to leave the chair lift.

我们会玩得很开心的012---We're gonna have fun.
我们可以做牛奶软糖012---We can make fudge.
同情食物012---Pity food?
没关系  我不需要你们  任何人留下来012---You know what? I don't need any of you to stay.
没有人该留下来012---Nobody stays.
嗯   那么我也表示一下好了012---Well, then I might as well offer to stay.
嗨012---Hey...
有人替罗斯难过吗012---Does anybody else feel bad about Ross?
你觉得他还在生我们的气吗012---You think he's still mad?
他可能更生气了  因为你今天还跟他借雪镜012---He's probably more mad since you called him to borrow his goggles.
怎样  我的没有反光层啊012---What? Mine aren't tinted.
钱德012---Chandler.
干嘛012---What?
标志上写什么012---What does the sign say?

你不去吗  不用了  谢谢012---Aren't you gonna go? No, thanks.
瑞秋不上公共厕所的012---Rachel never pees in public restrooms.
他们老是没有卫生纸012---They never have any paper in there.
所以我的规则是  没有卫生纸  就不去厕所012---So my rule is, "No tissue, no tushy."
既然大家都要去…012---Well, if everybody's going...
不要关门  钥匙在里面012---Don't close it. The keys are in there.
噢   千万不要012---Oh, no, no, no, no.
怎么了  我的打火机在里面012---What's going on? My lighter's in there.

别担心  我可以打开  有人有衣架吗012---I can open this. Anybody got a coat hanger?
我有012---Oh, I do.
噢  不对  我今早穿衣服时  把衣架拿出来了012---No, I took it out of my shirt when I put it on this morning.
所以你父母亲  如果没有离婚的话012---So if your parents hadn't divorced...
你就能正常的回答问题了012---...you'd be able to answer a question like a normal person?
我需要铁丝类的东西把它撬开012---Look, I just need a wire something to jimmy it.
你们其中一个人  把胸罩的钢圈给我012---One of you give me your bra underwire.

快点  谁的胸部最大012---Come on. Who has the biggest boobs?
胸部最大  胸罩最大  钢圈也最长012---Whoever has the biggest boobs, has the biggest bra and wire.
才不要   胸罩很贵012---No. It's too expensive.
要回车里  就需要钢圈012---To get back in the car, we need that wire.
你们自己做决定012---Your call.
好吧  摩妮卡的最大012---Monica's are the biggest.
这两粒小红豆  拜托  瑞秋的最大012---These tiny little non-breasts? Please. It's gotta be Rachel.
不对  我的是骗人的012---No, mine are deceptively small.
我有时候会在胸罩上塞东西012---I mean, I actually sometimes stuff my bra.
对  但是你的胸罩  还是一样很大012---Well, then your bra would still be big.
不对  我是塞在胸罩外面012---No, I stuff outside the bra.
女士们  你们就让步吧012---Ladies, let's just compromise, okay?
菲比  瑞秋  把摩妮卡的胸罩脱掉012---Phoebe, Rachel, take off Monica's bra.

好了012---There.
谢了  菲比  你真大方012---Thank you, Phoebe. That's very, very generous.
现在来讨论  谁的屁股最正012---Now, let's decide who has the nicest ass.

怎么了  怎么了012---What's going on? What?
这以前有发生过012---Yeah, this has happened before.
所以你知道该怎么办  对  多加点油012---So you know how to fix it? Yep. Put more gas in.
嗨  你怎么会来了012---Hi. What are you doing here?
我只是在想… 我们分开的时候012---I was wondering, when you and I split up...
你是不是拿了  录了《风流医生俏护士》的最后一集012---...did you get the tape that was half the last episode of M.A.S. H...
跟人质回国新闻的那卷带子012---...and half the hostages coming home?

你可以派人到76号公路  检查所有休息站吗012---Can you just send someone up and down 76 and check every rest stop?
93号也是012---And also 93?
好  不行  他们不肯012---Okay. No, they don't do that.
会有人来救我们的012---Somebody will come and save us.

他们就这样走了  头也不回的走012---They just took off without even looking back.
我才不需要他们  我有你们做我的朋友012---I don't need them. I've got you guys now as friends.

瑞秋  这里的棉条  只要一毛钱012---Hey, Rach. The tampons here are only a penny.
我们买回去囤积012---Let's stock up.
我们没油了  又不知道方位  没办法叫拖车012---We're out of gas and don't know where we are, so we can't get a tow truck.

很遗憾你的车子不能动了…012---I'm sorry your car broke down, Pheebs...

开我的车去接他们012---Take my car. Get your friends.
不  我才不要012---No, I won't pick them up.
我们都知道你会去的  因为你不是混蛋012---We both know you'll do it because you're not a jerk.
你顶多再骂半小时  还是会去接他们…012---So you can sulk here for half an hour, then go get them...
不如一边开车一边骂  不要  瑞秋…012---...or save time and sulk in the car. Rachel doesn't...
我很遗憾瑞秋为了马克甩掉你…012---I'm sorry Rachel dumped you for Mark...
你是无辜的受害者012---...and you're the innocent victim in this.
但不能因为这样  就迁怒你的朋友012---But don't punish your friends for what Rachel did.
你说得没错012---Yeah, you're right.
菲比  等等  罗斯有话要说012---Phoebe, hang on. Ross wants to say something.

你跟其他女人上床012---You slept with another woman?
你还有资格说啊012---Oh, you're one to talk.
好了012---Okay, done.
什么是"命救"012---What's "pleh"?
就是 "救命" 反过来写…012---That's "help" spelled backwards...
这样直升机在天空飞的时候  才看得懂012---...so that the helicopters can read it from the air.
蠢人反过来写是什么012---Ha. What's "dufus" spelled backwards?
有车了012---Car. Car.

州际公路上  有很多人需要帮助012---I have plenty of people to help on the interstate.

各位…012---You guys...
罗斯怎么办  他大老远开来这里012---...what do we do about Ross? He drove all the way up here.
叫他回去  我们留在这里滑雪吗012---Just send him back, then we'll go skiing?
真是烦死了012---This is horrible. It's just horrible.
嘿  我们是不是应该  叫罗斯一起来012---Should we ask Ross to come along?
但是瑞秋怎么办  要怎么问她012---But what about Rachel? How are we gonna even ask her?
问我什么012---Ask me what?
可以让罗斯留下来滑雪吗012---If, uh, it might be okay if Ross came skiing?
我没有要问啊012---No, I wasn't gonna ask that.
你们实在太扯了  不行  他不能去012---You guys are unbelievable. No, he cannot come.
什么  烦死了012---Excuse me? It's horrible.
拜托  我不能去你的神奇小屋吗012---Oh, please? Can't I come to your special, magical cabin?
你去干什么  你滑雪糟透了012---Why would you even want to come? You're a horrible skier.
真是说到我的痛处啊  滑雪技巧012---Oh. Hitting me where it hurts. My ski skills.
又来了012---Here we go again.
我受不了了012---I can't handle this, you guys.
我可以  我的绰号是"受得了"012---I can handle it. "Handle" is my middle name.
去头去尾后  就是"受得了"012---Actually, it's the middle part of my first name.
好了  菲比  你的车好了012---All right, Pheebs, your cab's ready.
走吧012---Let's go.
不客气012---You're welcome.
抱歉  你是在跟我说话  还是跟别人睡觉012---I'm sorry. Were you speaking to me, or sleeping with someone else?
我们当时是分手状态012---We were on a break.
你干嘛不把那句话  录在答录机上012---Why don't you just put that on your answering machine?

其实没有谁对谁错012---You know what? There is no right or wrong here.
不  我认为错的人很明显012---I think it's very obvious who's wrong here.
乔伊很明显  不这么认为012---Obviously not to Joey.
什么012---What?
乔伊和摩妮卡的想法跟我-样   你只会装无辜012---Joey and Monica feel like I do. You and this innocent act.
猜猜我是谁012---Hey, guess who I am?
看看你们对钱德  做了什么好事012---Look what you're doing to Chandler.
听着  我们都知道  你们两个很难受012---Look. We know that this is really, really hard for you guys.
你们不必爱对方012---You don't have to love each other.
你们现在甚至不必喜欢对方012---You don't even have to like each other much right now.
但你们必须想个办法  和平相处012---But please find a way to be around each other.
别让我们左右为难012---And not put us in the middle.
否则我们以后  就没办法在一起了012---Otherwise, I mean, that's just it for us hanging out together.
你们真的想这样吗012---Is that what you want?
讲理一点好吗012---Can you be civil?
好   我可以012---Yeah. I can.
很好  回车上去  快冷死了…012---Good, let's get back in the car. It's freezing...
而且我的胸部没有东西支撑012---...and my chest is unsupported.
等等012---Wait a second.
那现在是怎样  谁跟谁一起走012---I mean, what are we doing? Who's going with who?
听着  你们去吧012---Look, you guys should go.
你们都计划好了…012---You know, you planned this all out...
我不想毁了你们的周末  去吧012---...and I don't wanna ruin it. So just go.
别这样  你开了那么久的车过来012---You drove all the way up here. No, no, no.
反正我车子也得开回去012---I've gotta take the car back anyway.
明天一整天都得陪小班012---I'm spending all day tomorrow with Ben.
没关系的  去吧  不需要有罪恶感  真的012---It's fine, okay? Just go. No guilt, I promise.

我刚刚是在演《海神号遇险记》的 莎丽温德丝012---I was being Shelley Winters from The Poseidon Adventure.

什么事那么好笑012---What's so funny?
没事  我在练习演戏  我只是在练习假笑012---Oh, nothing. It's an acting exercise. I'm practicing my fake laugh.
怎么了  什么事那么好笑012---What? What's so funny?
喔  不…012---Oh, no, no.
不  这里禁烟012---No, no. There's none of that in here.
少来了  至少让我抽完最后一根012---Oh, come on. At least let me finish this last one.
好吧  除非你让我抽一口012---Okay, but only if you give me a drag.
好吧012---Okay.
该死  我又屈服在自己的欲望下012---Oh, dark mother, once again I suckle at your smoky teat.
那根就给你抽了012---Why don't you hold on to that one.
那是最不好玩的游戏012---That's, like, the least fun game ever.
我厌倦了你的抽烟习惯  所以我带了一样东西012---I'm sick of your smoking, so I brought something...
可以帮你戒烟012---...that is going to help you quit.
这个戒烟贴片没用012---That patch is no good.
这是催眠录音带012---It's a hypnosis tape.
我的女同事听了两星期  再也没抽过烟012---A woman at work used it for two weeks and hasn't smoked since.
你有什么问题012---What's your problem?
没事  我只是觉得催眠完全是在胡扯012---Nothing. It's just that hypnosis is beyond crap.
罗斯  我看过你在大西洋城被催眠012---I watched you get hypnotized in Atlantic City.
那家伙没有催眠我  好吗012---That guy did not hypnotize me, okay?
原来你常常脱掉裤子表演擦屁股012---You always pull your pants down and play "Wipe Out" on your butt.
别提催眠了012---Forget hypnosis.
想戒烟就得在石南花田里裸舞012---The way to quit smoking is to dance naked in a field of heather...
跟六名健康年轻男子   一起畅快地流汗012---...and then bathe in the sweat of six healthy young men.

嗨  天啊  法兰克012---Hi. Hi. Oh, my God! Frank!
你好吗  你来这里做什么012---Ha, ha. Hi. How are you? What are you doing here?
我该打电话给你的  但我把你的电话号码搞丢了012---I would've called, but I lost your number.
我妈把我锁在屋外  所以我没办法去找电话号码012---And then, uh, my mom locked me out of the house, so I couldn't find it.
我试着找公用电话012---And, uh, then I tried to find a pay phone
但话筒被剪断了012---and the receiver was cut off.
发生了什么事012---What happened?
有人破坏公物012---Uh, oh. Vandalism.
还有  你跟你妈怎么了012---But also, what happened between you and your mom?
我们大吵一架  因为她说我太幼稚  不该结婚012---We got in a fight. She said that I was too immature to get married.
你要结婚了  对012---You're getting married? Oh, yeah.
我弟弟要结婚了012---My little brother's getting married! Ha, ha.
我就知道你会很开心012---I knew you'd be so cool about this.

我要吗012---Do I?
你要吗012---Do you?
我当然要012---Yeah, I do.
酷啊  好吧  她正在停车012---Cool, all right. She's just parking the truck.
我去叫我未婚妻进来012---I'm gonna... I'm gonna go get my, uh, my fiancee, man!
我赌他是我们之中第一个结婚的人012---I'd have bet good money that he'd be the first one of us to get married.
这不是很棒吗012---Isn't it fantastic?
对  但你不觉得他还太小  不该结婚吗012---Yeah, but don't you think he's a little young to get married?
什么  他18岁了  他在自己的单身派对上喝酒012---What? He's 18. It'll be illegal for him to drink...
是犯法的012---...at his own bachelor party.
对  也不能召妓012---Yeah, or to get a hooker.
那本来就是犯法的  乔伊012---Always illegal, Joe.
嘿012---Hey! Hey!
她是我的未婚妻012---This is, uh, my fiancee...
奈特老师012---...Mrs. Knight. Ha-ha-ha.
她是我姐姐  这真的很有趣012---That's my sister. You know, it's funny.
法兰克常跟我提起你  但你跟我想像中完全不一样012---Frank told me so much about you, but you're not how I pictured you at all.
对  我非常讶异012---Yeah, I'm a big surprise.
请坐  来吧  坐下012---Here you go. Here, grab a seat. Oh.
你们是怎么认识的012---So how did you guys meet?
我在奈特老师的…012---Well, um, I was in Mrs. Knight's...
我是说爱丽丝  抱歉  我常那么做012---I mean, Alice. Sorry. I always do that. Ha, ha.
我上她的家政课012---I was in her Home Ec class.
他是我最好的学生012---He was my best student.
她是我最好的老师012---She was my best teacher.
如果让学生不跷课  还有什么办法呢012---If that doesn't keep kids in school, what will?
所以你们要结婚了012---And so now you guys are gonna be married?
对012---Yeah. Ha, ha.
我们本来只考虑同居012---We talked about just living together, but, um...
但我们想快点生小孩012---...we wanna have kids right away.
天啊012---Oh, my God!
太棒了012---Great!
哇  生小孩  法兰克  你确定准备好了吗012---Wow, kids. Frank, are you sure you're ready for that?
有多难吗012---How hard can it be?
我是说宝宝  谁不想要宝宝  对吧012---You know, I mean, you know, babies. Who doesn't want babies? Right?
而且我一直没有父亲陪我012---And besides, I never had a dad around.
现在我有个父亲了  那就是我012---And now I always will, because it'll be me.
我们知道  我们的岁数差很多012---Really, we do realize that there's an age difference between us.
太好了  因为你看起来好像不知道的样子012---Good. Because you were acting like you didn't.
但在爱情里  年龄不是问题012---But when it comes to love, what does age matter?
你很快就睡着了012---You are falling fast asleep.
睡得很熟012---Deeper, deeper, deeper.
现在你完全睡着了012---You are now completely asleep.
你不需要抽烟012---You don't need to smoke.
香烟不能控制你012---Cigarettes don't control you.
你是坚强有自信的女人012---You are a strong, confident woman...
完全不需要抽烟012---...who does not need to smoke.
坚强有自信的女人012---A strong, confident woman.
你知道吗  我发现去年  我只跟理查及胡立欧约过会012---You know what? I realized in the last year I've only gone out with Richard and Julio.
你得帮帮我  帮我介绍男人  让我重享爱情的滋味012---You gotta help me out. Set me up. Get me back in the game.
应该不是问题  我在时尚界  常遇见单身异性恋男人012---Shouldn't be a problem. I work in fashion, and all I meet are eligible straight men.
还需要什么服务吗012---Can I get you something else?
我要起司蛋糕  还有你能跟我约会012---Cheesecake and a date, if you're giving them out.
我们不是谈过了吗012---Heh. Haven't we covered that topic?
你刚刚才跟她说…  你想跟我约会012---You just said to her... You wanna go out with me...
因为我的假发  大胸部  还会帮你上菜012---...because of my wig, the big boobs, and I serve you food.
如果是真的  我该跟我的萝丝阿姨约会012---If that were true, I'd be dating my Aunt Ruth.
我们出去过两次  真的很怪012---And the two times we went out, it was plain awkward.
你觉得她该跟我去约会  对吧012---You think she should go out with me, don't you?
我是说…012---Well, I mean...
你确定你要跟她约会吗012---...are you sure you wanna go out with her?
早上不会太好看  你知道我的意思吗012---That ain't a pretty picture in the morning, know what I mean?
假发都乱了  假胸挂在床头柜上012---That wig all in disarray, and boobs flung over the nightstand.

我会的012---Oh, I will. Ha-ha-ha.
不  我知道这是法兰克的人生012---No, I know. I know that this is Frank's life.
你们知道吗012---You know?
我不想批评别人  但太变态了  也是不对的012---I don't wanna be judgmental, but it's sick. It's sick and wrong!
什么  年龄的关系吗012---What, is it the age thing?
不   我能接受年龄差距012---No, I'm fine with the age thing...
直到她把舌头伸进我弟弟的喉咙里012---...until it sticks its tongue down my brother's throat.
菲比  他似乎很喜欢012---Pheebs, he seems to enjoy it.
你们觉得他会喜欢忙着换尿布吗012---You think he'll enjoy it when he's up to his elbows in diapers...
因为他们必须立刻生孩子012---...of all the babies they have to have right away?
这对法兰克及宝宝都不公平012---This is not fair to Frank, and it's not fair to the babies.
你知道吗  这样的家政教育并不好012---You know what? It's not good home economics.
你跟他谈过吗012---Have you told him how you feel?
是的  但我没直说012---Yes. Not out loud.
如果你不跟他说  很快地他就会结婚  而你会恨你自己012---If you don't tell him, soon he'll be married, then you'll hate yourself.
对  如果我跟他说  他就会恨我012---Yeah, but if I do tell him, then he's gonna hate myself.
看看他跟他妈  我说不出口012---Look at him and his mom. I can't.
但是你们可以跟他谈谈  说服他放弃这个念头012---But you guys can. You talk him out of it.
不…012---No, no, no, no, no, no.
别这样  你们两个012---Come on, you guys.
你们没什么好损失的  我却会失去一切012---You have nothing to lose. I have everything to lose.
你们要我失去一切吗012---Do you want me to lose everything? Everything?
不要012---No.
好吧  我得去找法兰克012---Okay, I'm gonna go get Frank.
刚才走在街上  我转头跟你说012---We're walking down the street, and I turn to you and say:
"去脱衣酒吧坐坐" 还记得吗012---"Let's go hang out at Totally Nude Nudes." Remember?
然后你说 "我们还是去你家吧'012---And then, heh, you say, "Let's just hang out at your place."
很聪明啊  大傻瓜012---Well, that was a nice move, dumb-ass.
你应该跟这家伙约会012---I think you should go out with this guy.
不  他跟我完全不配012---No, he doesn't do anything for me.

开支票的事真的很可爱012---That check thing was adorable.
什么支票012---What check thing?
开玩笑的  这个客人暗恋我  给了我两万块小费012---As a joke, this customer who has a crush on me, gave me a $20,000 tip.
他的电话号码在支票上  他要我打电话给他012---His number's on the check. He did it so I'd call.
彼特贝克  彼特…012---Pete Becker. Pete...

我不敢相信  这是两万块支票  太令人兴奋了012---I can't believe this is a real $20,000 check. This is so exciting.
那是一种侮辱012---Or incredibly offensive.
当然  你说的对012---Yeah, sure. That too.
怎样012---What?
我们只是说  你不需要那么急012---All we're saying is, don't rush into anything.

你36岁时  她会是88岁012---When you're 36, she's gonna be 88.

不  我跟别人上床012---No, I, uh... I slept with someone else.
等一下  难道那样会让生活变得更美好012---So wait. So how did that make things better?
的确是没有012---It didn't.
以前你跟瑞秋的感觉   就是现在我跟爱丽丝的感觉012---What you used to have with Rachel is what I got with Alice.
那是什么样的感觉012---Now what is that like?
真的很酷012---It's so cool, man.
因为跟她在一起  比没有她的日子好多了012---It's because being with her is so much better than not being with her.
没错012---Yeah. Yeah.

这到底是怎么一回事   你想收买我吗012---I mean, what's the deal? Are you trying to buy me?
你都用这招要女人跟你约会012---Is this the way you get girls to go out with you?
我还在012---Uh, I'm still here.
你误会了  如果我不给你小费012---You're taking this wrong. If I didn't leave you that tip...

一顿饭  那是我唯一的要求  拜托012---One meal. That's all I'm asking for. Please?

如果你玩得不开心  我给你一万块  我们就扯平了012---If you don't have a good time, I'll give you 10 grand, we're even.
嗨  不012---Hi. Aah! No!
等一下  放下邮件  是我012---Wait, no. Just put the mail down. It's me.
抱歉   为什么你不开灯呢012---Sorry. Why were you just all in the dark?
你的衣服闻起来好香  我只想窝在里面012---Well, um, your laundry smelled so good that I thought I'd curl up in it.
可以吗  没问题012---Is that all right?  Yeah, sure.
今天你过得还好吗012---So how was your day?
这可能是我一生中最糟糕的一天012---It's just probably the worst one since I've been alive.
什么  发生了什么事012---What, um...? What happened?
爱丽丝…012---Um, Alice, uh...
她跟我分手012---She, uh, called it off.
喔  不012---Oh, no.
她有说为什么吗012---Did, um... Did she say why?
她没说  她只说我太年轻012---Uh, no, not really. Just that I was too young.
我不懂为什么突然间我变的年轻了012---I don't see how I could suddenly be too young...
我比我们刚在一起时还老012---...because I'm older than I was when we first got together.
对  不  我不…012---Yeah, yeah, no, I don't...
我不知道  你知道吗  或许这样子也好012---I don't know. But you know what? Maybe it's just all for the best.
对  但是我好痛苦012---Well, yeah, if the best is like unbelievable pain.
甜心012---Oh, sweetie.
我终于找到幸福012---You know, I was just finally happy.
我人生中的第一次012---For the first time in my life...
我爸离开我后012---...after my dad left me...
因为偷那些鸟被捕012---...and then getting arrested for stealing those birds...
还有肺部被刺破的事之后012---...and then the whole punctured-lung thing.
天气冷时我还是很难深呼吸012---It's still really hard to take deep breaths in cold weather...
但有了爱丽丝后  那些痛苦都不见了012---...but with Alice, all that stuff kind of went away.
现在她走了  我不知道为什么012---And now it's gone, and I don't know why.
我来告诉你为什么  都是我害的012---Ugh. Well, I can tell you why. It's because of me.
你知道吗  我会那么做是因为我爱你  好吗012---But you know what? I only did it because I love you, okay?
什么  我跟爱丽丝谈了一下012---What? Um, I kind of had a little chat with Alice...
让她明白为什么你们不能在一起012---...and I sort of made her see why you two shouldn't be together.
有一天你也会明白  真的012---And you'll see it too, one day. You really, really will.
等一下  这都是你搞的鬼012---Wait a minute. This is because of you?
好吧012---Okay...
等一下  不  我妈妈不要我们在一起012---Wait, no. My mother didn't want us to be together...
她顶多把我绑在门廊上012---...but the worst thing she did was tie me to the porch.
好吧  可是…012---Okay, but...
我来找你  因为我以为你能了解012---I came to you because I thought you'd understand.
喔  不012---Oh, no!
不012---No... Ugh.
我很想摔门走人012---I would storm out of here...
如果我有钱或有地方可去的话012---...if I had some money or a place to go.

你要去哪里  你喜欢披萨吗012---Where do you wanna go? You like pizza?

你不必付披萨钱012---You're not paying for the pizza.
少来了  这样才公平  你付了机票钱012---Come on, it's only fair. You paid for the flight.
够了吗012---Is that enough lira?
我会再加一千里拉012---Uh, I'd throw another 1000 on that.

嗨  法兰克012---Hi, Frank.
奈特老师012---Hi, Mrs. Knight.

这让人很难接受  但我们真的那么做是不对的012---It's hard to hear, but it would've been wrong to go through with it.
我太自私了012---I was being selfish.
即使现在我们的目标一样012---Even though we want the same things right now...
未来却未必如此012---...in the future, we may not.
对吧  对  但不只是那样012---Is that what it is? Yes, but not just that.

因为那时你跟罗斯在一起  我什么事都不能做012---But since you were with Ross, I didn't do anything about it.
现在你们分手了  我真的很想约你出去012---Now that you're not, I'd really like to ask you out sometime.

那个迷人可爱的男人要跟我约会012---...with this charming, cute guy who's asking me to go out with him...
我可以那么做012---...which I'm allowed to do...
可是我觉得有罪恶感  像是我背叛了罗斯012---...and I felt guilty, you know, like I'd be cheating on Ross or something.
好吧  或许那表示012---Wow. So, okay, maybe that means...
你还没有忘记罗斯  还有  你跟你爸之间有问题012---...that you're not over Ross yet and you have issues with your father.
我跟我爸没问题  好吧  或许那只是罗斯的关系012---I don't have any issues with my father. Okay, so it's probably just the Ross thing.
我讨厌这个女人  我恨她012---I hate this woman. I hate her.

把州名改成你的名字012---...and then just name it after yourself.
什么  譬如说彼特达科塔012---What, like, "Pete Dakota"?
或是密西西比彼特012---Or "Mississi-Pete."
我知道了  彼特芝加哥012---Ooh, ooh, I got it: "Pete Chicago."

我有毛病吗012---Is there something wrong with me?
为什么我只喜欢  跟我没有未来的男人012---I mean, why am I only attracted to guys where there's no future?
他们不是太老  就是太年轻012---Either they're too old or they're too young.
彼特为我疯狂012---And there's Pete, who's crazy about me...
他是那么完美  我对他是手到擒来012---...and he's absolutely perfect, and there's, like, zip going on.

我跟你说话  你没反应012---I talk to you, and nothing.
你看着我  完全没反应012---You look at me, and it's nothing.
就是没反应012---Nothing.
太好了012---Tasty.
我真的开始觉得你们有一段情  太棒了012---I'm really starting to feel like you guys have a history. It's nice.
我对这场戏有个问题  请说012---I have a question about this scene. Yes.

这个理由可以吗  剧本是那么写的012---Oh, hey, how about this one? Uh, it says so in the script.
我也不知道  为什么我的角色会喜欢你012---You know, I don't know why my character likes you either.
剧本上写着你是个贱人012---I mean, it says in the script here that you're a bitch.
剧本才没有那么写  我的剧本就是那么写的012---It doesn't say that in the script. It does in mine.
我可以把它吹干  或是涂发胶  那一点都不重要012---I can blow-dry it, I can put gel on it. It doesn't matter.
中间那个部分012---I still wind up with this little cowlick-y thing...
还是翘了起来  真的很讨厌012---...on the middle part of my head. It's so annoying.
你觉得困扰吗   是你让我觉得困扰012---Does it bug you? You bug me.
你有可能没看到这一幕吗012---Is there any chance you didn't see that?
罗斯  别再那么做了012---Ross, you gotta stop, okay?
你不能连续盯着窥视孔三小时012---You can't just stare through the peephole for three hours.
你的眼睛会坏掉的012---You're gonna get peep-eye.
我就知道  我一直都知道她喜欢他012---I knew it. I knew it. I always knew she liked him.
她可以拒绝的  看看她做了什么012---She'd say no, but here we are, right?
我们才刚分手  她马上就跟他约会012---We just broke up, first thing she does.
你们不是才刚分手012---You didn't just break up.
才三星期而已012---Hey, it's been, like, three weeks.
你在以为你们分手后三小时  就跑去跟别人上床012---You slept with somebody three hours after you thought you broke up.

如果她跟他吻别  我发誓我要自杀012---If she kisses him good night, I'm gonna kill myself. I swear.
我看不下去了012---I can't watch.
快点  约会结束了012---Come on. Date over. Date over.
太好了  她要进去了  好的012---Here we go. She's going in. Okay.
她要进去了  等一下  他也进去了012---She's going in. Ha, ha. Wait. He's going in.
他要进去了012---He's going in.
门关上了  门关着我看不到012---The door's closed. I can't see anything with the door closed.
发明门的人可以安息了012---And the inventor of the door rests happily in his grave.
好吧  我得想想办法  必须阻止他们012---Okay, I have to do something. I mean, I have to stop it.
阻止他们做什么  我不知道012---Stop what? I don't know.
但直觉告诉我说  换作是我  我们会做什么012---But I have a feeling that my being there will do it.
我要过去借东西012---I'll go over and I will borrow something.
果汁  我需要果汁  不012---Juice. I need juice. No.
不可以  帮帮我012---You can't. A little help.
我得阻止他们  我是你的朋友012---They must be stopped. I am your friend...
我不能让你这么做012---...and I am not gonna let you do this.
你真的好壮012---You are surprisingly strong.
我需要果汁  人们需要果汁  听着012---I need juice. People need juice. Look, man...
人们需要果汁  他们需要… 听我说012---People need juice. Juice. They need... Listen to me.
她开始新生活了  就算不是他  也会是别人012---She's moving on, okay? If it's not this guy, it's gonna be somebody else.
如果你考虑租用我的窥视孔012---And unless you're thinking about subletting my peephole...
你要接受事实  你们结束了012---...you are gonna have to get used to the fact that the relationship is over.
好吗  你们结束了012---Okay, man? It's over.
对  好吧  好吧012---Yeah, okay. Okay.
我真的很想她012---It's just I miss her so much.
我知道012---I know.
为什么你们的马克杯底写着编号012---Why do all your coffee mugs have numbers on the bottom?
那样  摩妮卡才能加以追踪012---Oh, that's so Monica can keep track.
如果有杯子不见了  她会说" 27号杯在哪里"012---That way, if one of them is missing, she can be like, "Where's number 27?"
你知道吗012---You know what?
不  我想我不要知道012---No, and I don't think I'm gonna want to.
我没办法012---I can't do this.
对  所以我不想知道012---Yep. Yep. That's what I didn't want to know.
对  马克  我这么做是不对的012---Yeah. Oh, Mark, I'm just doing this for the wrong reasons, you know?
我只是想报复罗斯012---I'm just doing it to get back at Ross.
抱歉  这对你来说不公平012---I'm sorry. It's not very fair to you.
公平  天啊  你知道吗012---Ah. Fair, shmair. You know?
听着  如果你想报复罗斯  我可以帮你012---Look, you wanna get back at Ross, I am here for you.
真的012---Really.
不  我是说我们就在这张沙发上  好好地报复他吧012---No, no. I say we get back at him right here on this couch. Right here.
喔  天啊012---Oh, my God.
我真的很抱歉012---I'm sorry about this.
没关系012---That's okay.
你确定吗   对012---You sure? Yeah.
我可以回家自己报复他012---I can just go home and get back at him by myself.
那会是21世纪的盘尼西林012---And should become the penicillin of the 21 st century.
现在这家医院要迈开大步012---And so today, this hospital is about to take major steps...
领导这场革命012---...toward leading that revolution.
这真的太讽刺了  我能问你一件事吗012---It is truly ironic. Hey. Can I ask you something?
目前是什么状况012---Where are we?
看到那些医生跟护士012---Well, with all these doctors and nurses...
我想应该是矮人马戏团012---...I'm gonna say, Midget Rodeo.
跟我说实话012---Just tell me the truth.
好吧012---Okay.
我没跟你提过这件事012---Um, you know, I don't think I told you this...
我刚刚结束一段认真的恋情012---...but, um, I just recently got out of a really serious relationship.
对  那不是一年前的事吗012---Oh, right. Wasn't that like a year ago?
我跟你说过了012---So I did tell you.
好吧  那不是问题012---Okay, well, you know, that's not really the thing.
问题是我现在的生活状态是012---The thing is, is that right now I'm just in a place in my life...
我只想好好做自己012---...where I just need to focus on me. - Mm.
你了解我的意思吗  对  我知道012---Do you know what I mean? Oh, yeah, I know.
我真的很想喜欢你  但你不喜欢我  好吧012---I so want to be attracted to you. But you're not. Okay. Good.
对不起012---I'm sorry.
你知道吗  别那么说  这不是…012---You know what? Don't be. This is not...
别那么说  真的没那么糟糕012---Don't be, because it's not so bad.
是吗  对  我知道我不是邦·乔维012---It's not? Yeah. I know I'm no Jon Bon Jovi.
或是你喜欢的那一型012---Or someone you find attractive.
我只是觉得…012---I just think, you know...
或许你终究会爱上我012---...that you might end up feeling differently.
听着  我没有恶意012---Well, look, I don't want this to come out wrong...
但我刚刚拒绝了你  你似乎还蛮有自信的012---...but, uh, you seem awfully confident for a guy I just told I wasn't attracted to.
对  我超迷人的对吧012---Yeah, stupidly charming, isn't it?
听着  你要吃点东西吗012---Uh, listen. Let's... You wanna get something to eat?
这里让人觉得压力好大012---Because this place is kind of depressing.
欢迎幕后大功臣彼特贝克先生012---Now the man who made this possible, Mr. Peter Becker.
等一下012---One second.
我想这个小镇容不下我们两个012---I don't think this town is big enough for the both of us to relax in.
拔枪吧012---Draw.
我什么都没做012---I wasn't doing anything.
她又做了什么012---Uh-oh. What did she do now?
她念过耶鲁戏剧系  她就觉得她是自从有面包片以来012---Just because she went to Yale Drama, she thinks she's, like, the greatest actress...
最伟大的女演员012---...since sliced bread.
面包片  超棒的马克白夫人012---Ah, Sliced Bread. A wonderful Lady Macbeth.
天啊  我恨她  我讨厌她说"我超有天分的"012---God, I just... I hate her. I hate her with her "Oh, I'm so talented"...
"我真的好漂亮  我闻起来好香"012---...and "Oh, I'm so pretty," and "Oh, I smell so good."
我想有人喜欢上某人了012---I think somebody has a crush on somebody.
钱德  拜托你专心在我的问题上012---Hey, Chandler, can we please try and stay focused on my problem here?
你知道吗012---You know?
我是在说你  大怪胎012---I'm talking about you, you big, big freak.
你疯了012---Oh. You're out of your mind.
过去48小时以来  你满口都是她012---Hey, you've done nothing but talk about her for the last 48 hours.
如果你还在念小学012---If you were in school yard...
你会拉她的马尾  把她推倒012---...you'd be pulling her pigtails and pushing her down now.
是吗  为什么我满脑子都是她012---Oh, yeah? Then how come I keep thinking about her...
还有春梦呢012---...in all these sexual scenarios and stuff, huh?
开心  我该那么做吗  维多  开心012---Happy? Is that what I'm supposed to be, Vic? Happy?
你何不告诉我  你想怎么做012---Well, why don't you tell me what you're supposed to be, huh?
因为我就是搞不懂012---Because I sure as hell can't figure it out.
我跟你说话  你没反应012---I talk to you, and it's nothing.
你看着我  完全没反应012---You look at me, and nothing.
就是没反应012---Nothing.
你们让我想飞上天012---You guys make me fly.
飞很高012---High.
好吧  明天从这里接下去012---Okay, we're gonna pick it up here tomorrow.
那是… 好多了012---Well, that was, uh... Better?
对  那真的是…012---Yeah, yeah, it was definitely...
一大进步012---...an improvement.
晚安  凯特012---Good night. Uh, Kate.
什么事012---Yeah?
你忘了穿鞋012---You, uh... You forgot your shoes.
或许我需要鞋子  对吧012---I'm probably gonna need those, huh?
好吧  听着012---Okay. Hey, listen...
要一起喝杯咖啡吗012---...you, uh, feel like getting a cup of coffee?
凯特  什么012---Um... Yo.  Kate.

明天见  当然012---See you tomorrow, huh? Yeah. Yeah. Sure.
对  晚安012---Right. Good night.
嘿012---Hey.
为什么不是 "蜘蛛人"012---Why isn't it "Spiderman"?
譬如葛德曼或席佛曼012---You know, like Goldman, Silverman?
因为那不是他的姓氏012---Because it's not his last name.
真的  没错  他又不是…012---It isn't? No, it's not, like...
菲尔史派德曼012---Like Phil Spiderman.
他是变身为蜘蛛的…012---He's a spider...
人012---...man.
葛德曼是姓氏012---You know, like, uh... Like Goldman is a last name.
可是根本就没有金人012---But there's no gold man.
好吧012---Oh, okay.
应该有金人的012---There should be a Gold Man.
嗨  嘿  瑞秋012---Hey. Hey, Rach.
工作还顺利吧  太棒了012---How was work? Oh, great.
虽然我一屁股坐下  发现根本没有椅子012---Although I did sit down where there wasn't a chair.
对了  罗斯把你的东西拿过来012---By the way, Ross dropped by a box of your stuff.
我早就知道他会那么做012---Oh. Well, I guess I had that one coming.
我要把它拿去丢了  或许只是一堆洗发精跟…012---I'm just gonna throw it out. It's probably just a bunch of shampoo and...
怎么了012---Something wrong?
不  没事012---Hmm. No. Nothing.
金人有什么样的力量012---So, uh, what kind of powers would Gold Man have?
好吧  他能点石成金012---Okay. Well, he would turn things to gold.
如果那本来就是黄金呢  他就完成了他的使命012---What about things that are already gold? Ah. His work is done.
好吧  来玩我的游戏012---Okay, let's play my game.
好的012---Okay.
好吧  你这个王八蛋012---All right, you yellow-bellied, lily-livered...
拔枪吧012---Draw.
对  这真的很好玩012---Yeah, it's fun.
等一下  你说这个女演员012---Wait a minute. You're telling me this actress person...
是唯一你渴望得到她  她却不要你的女人012---...is the only woman you ever wanted who didn't want you back?
对012---Yeah.
天啊012---Oh, my God.
你的人生都是这样吗012---Is this what it's like to be you?
你真的爱上她了吧  你不懂012---Wow, you're really crazy about her, huh? Oh. You have no idea.
我们在舞台上  我得吻她跟触摸她012---And when we're on-stage, I get to kiss her and touch her.
然后她跟导演回家012---But then she goes home with the director...
就像有人把我的心挖出来一样012---...and it's like somebody's ripping out my heart.
很高兴你也有这种感觉012---Oh, it's so great to see you feeling like this.
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
摩妮卡  今天早上爸打电话来012---Monica, uh, Dad called this morning...
席薇亚阿姨过世了012---...and, uh, Aunt Sylvia passed away.
太棒了012---Yes. Yes. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
我们都很震惊012---We were all pretty shaken up about it.
等一下  我是不是漏掉了什么事012---Wait, am I missing something?
我以为死亡只会带来悲伤012---Because I always thought death was supposed to be sad, in a way.
席薇亚阿姨012---Well, uh, Aunt Sylvia was...
不是个好人012---...well, not a nice person.
没错  她是个残忍爱挑剔的老太婆012---No, she was a cruel, cranky old bitch.
我很遗憾她过世了012---And I'm sorry she died.
爸说我得到娃娃屋了吗012---Did Dad say I get the dollhouse?
你得到娃娃屋了  我得到娃娃屋了012---You get the dollhouse.  I get the dollhouse.
娃娃住的房子  超棒的012---Wow. A house for dolls. That is so cool.
小时候我只有一个桶子012---When I was a kid, I had a barrel.
菲比  你把娃娃放在桶子里012---Uh, Pheebs, you had a barrel for a dollhouse?
不  只有桶子012---No, just a barrel.
你知道吗  你可以玩我的娃娃屋012---You know what? You can play with my dollhouse.
真的吗  随时都可以012---Really? Really? Any time you want.
小时候我只想玩这个娃娃屋012---When I was younger, all I wanted to do was to play with this dollhouse.
不行  它只能看  不能碰012---But no. It was to be looked at, but never played with.
以前我奶奶也是那么说我的012---My grandmother used to say that exact same thing to me.
《老友记》 第三季  第20集  娃娃屋012---Friends S03E20  The One with the Dollhouse

他怎么了012---So, uh, what's wrong with him?
没事  他本来就呆呆的  我几乎不再注意到这一点012---Oh, nothing. He's just goofy like that. I actually hardly notice it anymore.
不  我是说他已婚  或有交往对象吗012---Oh, no, no, no. I mean, is he, um, married or involved with anyone?
不  他是单身  也没有跟任何人交往012---No, no. He's not married or involved with anyone.
瑞秋012---Oh, Rachel...
你知道吗  算了012---Actually, you know what? Forget it.
如果你要的话  我能帮你约他  真的吗012---I'll ask him for you if you want me to. Would you?
那不会显得我太悲惨绝望吗012---Or is it just too sad and desperate...
就跟苏菲会做的事一样012---...you know, something that Sophie would do?
我在这里  我知道012---I am here. I know that.
你们看012---Look at it.

这是什么012---What's this?
那是狗  每间屋子都该有狗012---That's a dog. Every house should have a dog.
我不要会在屋顶尿尿的狗012---Not one that can pee on the roof.
或许他会这么大   因为屋子是用辐射废弃物盖成的012---Well, maybe it's so big because the house was built on radioactive waste.
这是为了预防屋子打喷嚏吗012---And is this in case the house sneezes?
不  那是阁楼的鬼魂012---No. No, that's the ghost for the attic.
我不要鬼   没有人要鬼012---I don't want a ghost. Well, nobody wants a ghost.
但你有一个鬼012---But you've got one...
因为屋子盖在古老的印第安坟场上012---...because the house is sitting on an ancient Indian burial ground.
等一下   屋子用辐射废弃物盖成012---Wait a minute. The house was built on radioactive waste...
而且位于古老印第安坟场012---...and an ancient Indian burial ground?
不可能会有那种事012---Ha, ha. That would never happen.

好吧  我的上司乔安娜   你离开后012---Okay. My boss, Joanna. When you left...
她开始问起你的事012---...she started asking questions about you.
看上眼了012---Ha, ha. Liked what she saw, huh?
她喜欢我的活力  对吧012---Dug my action, did she?
打探小钱钱的事012---Checking out the Chan Chan Man.

它们的尺寸不对  不是维多利亚时代风格  完全不配012---They're not the right size, they're not Victorian, and they just don't go.
好吧012---Okay.Fine.
来吧  恐龙  没想像力的屋子不欢迎我们012---Come, dinosaur. We're not welcome in the house of no imagination.
菲比  既然我们谈到这一点012---Uh, Pheebs, while we're hovering around the subject...
我只是想说恐龙不会汪汪叫012---...I just have to say that dinosaurs, they don't go, "Ruff."
小恐龙就会012---The little ones do.

看到德瑞克雷莫瑞医生012---...on Days of our Lives.
不可能  真的吗012---Get out of here. Really?
当然012---Absolutely. Huh.
后来他们把你推下电梯井012---Oh, but then they went and dropped you down that elevator shaft.
对  他们真的杀了我012---Yeah, they gave me the shaft, all right.
你真的好有趣012---You're so funny.
听着  你排完戏要做什么012---Listen, um, what are you doing after rehearsal?
要不要去喝一杯012---Do you wanna get a drink or something?

可惜我没办法好好享受   因为乔安娜好无聊012---Of course, I didn't get to enjoy any of that because Joanna's such a big dull dud.
钱德真的太棒了012---Chandler is fantastic.

他来家里接我  我一开门就觉得心动012---Like, he came by to pick me up. I opened the door, and it was just like, "click."
他有跟你说吗  那个嘛…012---Did he tell you? Well...
他真的很好心  他是个好心人吧012---Oh, and he's got such a good heart. Doesn't he have a good heart?
我知道  他真的好体贴012---Oh, I know. And he's so sweet.
他说他会打电话过来  直接帮我接到办公室012---He said he'd call, so put him straight through.
很棒吧  别扫兴012---Isn't this great? Don't spoil it.
来吧  宝贝  别走  求求你012---Come on, baby, don't go. Please?
你觉得呢012---What do you say?
喂012---Hello? Oh!
是你  等一下012---It's you. Just, uh... Just one sec.
我得接这电话012---I am going to take this call.
等一下我希望在舞台上012---When I continue, I hope that there will appear on-stage...
可以看到魔法  在剧场界我们称之为012---...this magical thing that in the theater we call...
入戏012---...committing to the moment.
这家伙跟卡通人物一样012---The guy's like a cartoon.
你到底看上他哪一点012---What do you see in him, anyway?
他非常聪明012---He happens to be brilliant.
比跟你约会的毛衣女好多了012---Which is more than I can say for that sweater you're dating.
我对她的毛衣没兴趣012---Hey, I'm not interested in her sweater.
重要的是毛衣下面的东西012---It's what's underneath her sweater that counts.
而且…012---And besides, since, uh...
你干嘛在乎我跟谁约会012---Since when do you care who I'm going out with?
我不在乎  为什么  你要我在乎吗012---I don't care. Why? Do you want me to care?
你要我希望你在乎吗012---Heh. Do you want me to want you to care?
是吗012---Do you?
什么012---What?
好吧  恐怕我得这么做  从刚刚中断那里开始012---Okay. I'm afraid to say this, but let's pick it up where we left off.
来吧  宝贝  别走  求求你 你觉得呢012---Come on, baby, don't go. Please? What do you say?
我没有留下来的理由012---I've got no reason to stay.
停012---Stop.
停  你们必须停下来012---Stop it. You must stop.
你们都是烂演员012---You are bad actors.
这是出烂戏012---This is a terrible play.
明天早上见012---I'll see you in the morning.
我不敢相信   再过一星期我们就要演出012---I can't believe we go on in a week.
一定不会有问题的012---Hey, it's gonna be all right. Hey.
既然提早收工  你要去画马克杯吗012---So since we're getting off early, do you want to go and paint mugs?
什么012---What?
昨晚我跟你提过的那个地方012---You know, at that place I told you about last night?
对  画马克杯012---Oh, yeah, with the mug-painting. Yeah.
我有注意听012---I was so listening to that. Ha, ha.
你知道吗  今晚我得练习一下012---But, uh, you know what? I think I need to work on my stuff tonight.
好的   好的012---Oh, okay. Okay.
明天见  好的012---I'll see you tomorrow. Okay.
好的  晚安012---Okay. Ha, ha. Night.
你没事吧012---Uh, are you okay?
我想应该没事012---Yeah, I guess.
我们该如何演这场戏012---Like, what are we gonna do about the scene, huh?
我不知道012---I don't know.
好吧012---Well, um...
或许我们该激烈一点012---Maybe if it had more heat.
你什么意思012---Well, how do you mean?
安德丽娜在找理由留下来  对吧012---Well, Adrianne's looking for a reason to stay, right?
维多不能只是吻她   他必须…012---Victor can't just kiss her. He's gotta...
他必须给她一个理由  你知道吗012---He's gotta really give her a reason, you know?
或许他可以跟她舌吻012---Maybe he could slip her the tongue.
或许…012---Or maybe...
或许他可以抓住她   把她抱起来012---Maybe he could grab her and lift her up.
对  安德丽娜用脚缠住他的腰012---Yeah, yeah. Then Adrianne, maybe she could wrap her legs around his waist.
然后她撕开他的衬衫  亲他的胸膛跟肚子012---And then she could rip off his shirt and kiss his chest and his stomach.
他可以用他的牙齿扯开她的洋装012---And then he could use his teeth, his teeth, to undo her dress and...
还要咬她012---And bite her.
这场戏结束时   他可以占有她012---And then right when the scene ends, he could take her...
用他那原始的  兽性的…012---...with this raw, animal...
就像那样吗012---Something like that?
对   差不多跟我想的一样012---Yeah, that's pretty much what I had in mind.
对  对012---Yeah. Yeah.
嗨   嘿012---Hi.  Hey.
现在喝酒太早了012---It's a little early to be drinking.
我终于跟凯特有进展了012---Things, uh, finally happened with Kate.
你在开玩笑  太棒了  太棒了012---Oh. That's great.  You're kidding. That's great.
真的很棒012---Oh, it was so amazing.
跟她做爱后…012---After the lovemaking...
天啊012---Oh, my.
我看着她沉睡   一看就好几个小时012---I just watched her sleep for, like, hours.
她只是在吸气012---Just breathing in... Huh.
吐气012---...and breathing out.
我知道她在做梦  因为她的眼睛是这样的012---And I knew she was dreaming because her eyes kept going like this:
我得说乔安娜误会了  好吗012---I'm telling you, Joanna's got it all wrong, okay?
我只是说"这真的很好玩  我们有空再出来"012---All I said was, "This was fun. Let's do it again sometime.
"我会打电话给你"012---I'll give you a call."
不知道为什么  她以为你会打电话给她012---I wonder why she thinks you're going to call her?
约会后就得那么说012---That's what you say at the end of a date.
你就不能说"幸会  晚安"吗012---You can't just say, "Nice to meet you. Good night"?
当她的面说012---To her face?
那时我们结束约会  我站在那里012---It's the end of the date, I'm standing there...
她等着我说  我会打电话给她012---...she's waiting for me to say I'll call her...
我只是脱口而出  无法控制自己012---...and it just, you know, comes out. I can't help it.
那是一时冲动012---It's a compulsion.
别这样  瑞秋  男人说他会打电话012---Come on, Rach, when a guy says he's gonna call...
不代表他一定会打012---...it doesn't mean he's going to call.
你没遇过那种事吗012---This never happened to you?
他们一向会打电话来012---Well, they always called.
该死012---Bite me.
他有打电话来吗  没有  抱歉012---Did he call? No, sorry.
为什么  他说他会打电话  为什么他没打012---Why? Why? He said he'd call. Why hasn't he called?
或许他害怕聪明  坚强  成功的女强人012---Maybe he's intimidated by really smart, strong, successful women.
苏菲   拜托你别拍我马屁012---Sophie, will you please climb out of my butt.
为什么他不打来  瑞秋  好吧012---Why hasn't he called, Rachel? Why? Okay, okay.
或许他觉得很怪  因为你是我的上司012---Um, well, uh, maybe he feels awkward because you are my boss.
为什么他要觉得怪012---Awkward? Why should he feel awkward?
该觉得怪的人是你  你没有叫他别打电话来吧012---The only person that should feel awkward is you.You didn't tell him not to call me?
如果你不喜欢你朋友跟你老板约会012---If you're uncomfortable with your friend dating someone you work for...
总是有办法可以解决的012---...there are always ways to fix that.
立刻打电话给她012---Call her. Call her now.
我的手被割伤了012---Multiple, so many paper cuts.
为什么他不打电话来   瑞秋012---"Why hasn't he called, Rachel? Why? Why?
我不明白  他说他会打电话的  为什么…012---I don't understand. He said he'd call."
钱德  我得说她抓狂了  她发疯了012---Chandler, I'm telling you, she's flipped out. She's gone crazy.
把电话给我012---Oh. Well, give me the phone, then.
这一点都不好玩  她觉得你没打电话都是我的错012---This isn't funny. She thinks it's my fault you haven't called her.
你必须打电话给她012---You have to call her.
听着  隔了这么久  你不能打电话跟对方说012---Look, you can't call somebody after this long just to say:
"如果你没发现  我不喜欢你"012---"In case you didn't notice, I don't like you."
那么你得再约她出去012---Then you're gonna have to take her out again.
不  她真的很无趣   而且她的眼角012---No. She's really dull, and she gets this...
还留着睫毛膏的污渍012---...gross mascara-goop thing in the corner of her eye.
我不在乎012---I don't care. I don't care.
你得再约她出去  做个了断012---You'll take her out again and end it...
让她知道你们真的没希望012---...and end it in a way that she knows it's actually ended.
我不知道这对你来说有多难   别再跟她说你会打电话给她012---And I don't care how hard it is for you. Do not tell her you'll call her again.
好吧012---All right, fine.
只是一次午餐约会  从现在开始我会自己追女生012---But it's just a lunch date. From now on, I get my own dates.
我不要你再帮我牵红线了012---I don't want you setting me up with anybody again.
没问题012---That's fine.
我只是说说  你知道的  我知道012---That's just a lot of big talk, you know. I know.
摩妮卡012---Mon?
我在浴室012---I'm in the shower.
失火了…012---Aah! Fire. There's a fire. Fire.

你跟马歇尔说了吗012---Did you, uh...? Did you talk to Marshall?
说什么012---About what?
你知道的  我们之间的事012---Ha, ha. You know, about what happened with us.
没有012---No.
没理由让他知道012---And there's really no reason why he should find out.
我们不要小题大做  好吗012---So, uh, let's not make a big deal out of it, okay?
你是什么意思012---What are you talking about?
这件事很重要012---It was a big deal.
少来了  你不能跟我说  昨晚的事对你来说毫无意义012---I mean, come on, you can't tell me last night didn't mean something to you.
我也在场  你的演技没那么厉害012---I was there. You're not that good an actress.
听着012---Look.
我只是一时意乱情迷012---Um, I was... I was just caught up in the moment.
就那样012---That's all it was.
乔伊   我很遗憾让你伤心012---Joey, I'm sorry you feel bad...
你没跟  你在乎她多过于她在乎你的女人上床过012---...but haven't you ever slept with a woman where it meant more to her than to you?
没有012---No.
凯特  萝伦  嗨嗨012---Hi, Kate. Hi, Lauren.
嗨   萝伦012---Hi, Lauren.

对012---Yeah.

什么  天啊012---What? Oh, my... Oh, my God.
发生了什么事012---What happened?
我们相信起火点在这里012---Well, we believe it originated here...
就在芬芳疗室012---...in the Aroma Room.
好吧  大家都逃出来了吗012---All right, did everyone get out okay?
长颈鹿跟海盗都没事012---Well, the giraffe's okay and so is the pirate.
这是什么  不  菲比别看012---What is this? No, Phoebe, don't look.
你不会想看的012---You don't want to see what's under there.
寄宿小狗012---The foster puppets.
没什么大不了的012---It's not a big deal.
它只是··一直都在这里012---It's just... It's right here, and it's all the time.
谢谢你请我吃午餐012---Well, thanks again for lunch.
对  很愉快  真的  没错吧012---Yes, this was pleasant. It was, wasn't it?
那里的东西很好吃  可不是吗012---The food there was great. Wasn't it?
保重012---So take care.
你也是012---You too.
真的太棒了  我会打电话给你  改天再聚012---This was great. I'll give you a call. We should do it again.
太棒了  我很期待012---Great. I'm looking forward to it.
瑞秋  有留言吗  在苏菲的桌上012---Rachel, any messages? Sophie's desk.
钱德  你要打电话给她吗012---Chandler. Are you gonna call her?
不  钱德012---No. Chandler.
听着  对不起  我软弱  可悲又抱歉012---Look, I'm sorry, okay? I'm weak and pathetic and sorry.
好  你得立刻告诉她012---Okay, you are gonna tell her. You're gonna tell her now.

抱歉我说我会打电话给你  我根本就不想打012---I'm sorry that I said I was going to when I'm not.
听着  这跟你无关012---Ugh. Look, this has nothing to do with you.
这不是瑞秋的错  都是我的错012---And this isn't Rachel's fault. It's me.
提到女人  我有很严重的问题012---I have serious, serious problems when it comes to women.
我害怕承诺  亲密012---I have issues with commitment, intimacy...
睫毛膏污渍012---...mascara goop.
真的很抱歉   这是行不通的012---And I'm really sorry. It's just that this is not... This isn't gonna work out.
这跟我希望的结局不同012---Well, this isn't how I was hoping this would end...
我想我得感激你的诚实012---...but I guess I have to appreciate your honesty.
好吧012---Yeah, okay.
好吧012---So...

我…012---I've, uh...
最近我能体会你的感觉  对不起012---I've recently learned what it's like to be on your side of it...and I'm sorry.

不幸地是  事实上012---Unfortunately, the sad fact remains...
这些小家伙都活不过国庆日012---...that most of these little guys won't live to see the Fourth of July.
因为照顾不周  他们都会死掉012---Because as a result of improper care, they will be dead.

我看到电视广告012---Because I was watching this, uh, commercial on TV...

什么012---What? Oh.
你能相信他为我买了一家餐厅吗012---Can you believe he just offered me a restaurant?
真是个混蛋   你要我踢他屁股吗012---What a jerk. You want me to kick his ass?
这一直是我的梦想  自从我买了第一个快速烤箱012---I mean, this has been my dream since I got my first Easy-Bake Oven...
开了第一家快速摩妮卡面包店后012---...and opened Easy-Monica's Bakery.
我是说  我能胜任这份工作  难不了我012---I mean, I would kill for this job. I mean, I can totally do this job...
天知道我已经受够了012---...and God knows I've paid my dues. Ugh.
但彼特会这么做是因为他喜欢我012---But Pete's just doing this because he has a crush on me.
你还是对他没感觉  没错012---And you're still not attracted to him at all? Mm. No.
我怎么能接受他送我餐厅  我没办法012---I mean, how could I accept a restaurant from him? I can't.
我念七年级时  就没办法收下史都文森送我的项链012---I couldn't even accept a necklace from Stu Vincent in the seventh grade.

你猜怎么了  你不再是我的女朋友了012---Guess what. You're not my girlfriend anymore, so...

好吧  问题是这样的012---Okay, here's the thing.
不  别那么说  我讨厌你那么说012---Oh, no. Not "the thing." I hate "the thing."
有什么问题呢012---What's "the thing"?
我没办法那么做012---I can't do it.
对不起  我真的很想答应012---I'm sorry. I wish I could...
听着  你暗恋我012---...but, um, see, you have these feelings for me.
等一下  你在担心那个012---Wait, wait, wait. That's what you're worried about?
如果那是问题  我们之间没有问题012---If that's the problem, we've got no problem.
不  我打算在吃晚餐时告诉你  出差时我认识一个女孩012---Huh? No.I was gonna tell you this over dinner, but I met somebody else, on my trip.
她叫做安  她是个记者  我们在飞机上认识012---Her name's Ann. She's a journalist. Uh, we met on the plane.
她问我可不可以吃掉我的花生012---She asked me if she could finish off my peanuts.
我以为她是指别的东西  我们哈哈大笑012---I thought she said something else. We had a big laugh.
我只是厌倦了等待012---Yeah, I just... I mean, I got tired of waiting.
真的很棒  我是说对不起  但我为你感到高兴012---Oh, that's great. I mean, I'm sorry, but I'm so happy for you.
现在我能为你工作了  我想是的012---And now I can work for you. I guess you can.
天啊  这太不可思议了012---Oh, my God. Oh, this is incredible. Oh.
好吧  你知道吗  我得进办公室提出辞职012---All right. You know what? I'm just gonna roll right into that office and quit.

什么012---What?
我是说这个女人  是你编出来的  对吧012---I'm just saying, this woman, I mean, she's fictitious, no?
为什么你要那么说  因为你还是喜欢摩妮卡012---Why would you say that? You're still into Monica.
所以你跟她说你有了别人  她会答应跟你合作012---So you told her there's somebody else so she'd agree to work with you.
相处久了  也许就会产生感情012---Because you figure, if you spend time together, maybe something might happen.
你很厉害   你很厉害012---You're good. You're good.
对  不  我的直觉很准  还有通灵能力012---Yeah. No, I'm fairly intuitive. And psychic.
那是老天爷的赏赐012---It's a substantial gift.
听着  你能答应我不告诉她吗012---Listen, can you promise me that you won't tell her, though?
当然  我保证  跟她说什么012---Absolutely. Oh, I promise. Tell her what?
谢谢012---Thanks a lot.
不  我是认真的  我的直觉很准  但记性很差012---No, I'm serious. I mean, I'm intuitive, but my memory sucks.
好吧  这是最后一次012---Okay, but this is the last time.

我要去换衣服了  要跟其它一些演员一起喝酒012---Anyway, I gotta change. I'm meeting some of the cast for drinks.

我待在家里  让你去彩排012---I stayed home from work while you were at rehearsal...

你一进门  陪了我们两秒钟012---And then you come in and spend two seconds with us...
然后你就要出门跟朋友花天酒地012---...and then expect to go off gallivanting with your friends?
这样不行喔  先生012---Well, I don't think so, mister.
我需要放松  好吗  我工作了一整天012---Hey. I need to relax, okay? I was working all day.
照顾小鸡就不忙吗012---And you don't think taking care of our chick is work?
我不是那个意思  好吧  我是说…012---That's not what I said. Okay, I just meant...
我了解你的意思012---I know what you meant.
你有没有发现  自从养了小鸡后012---Did you notice that ever since we got this chick...
我们吵得比以前厉害012---...we've been fighting a lot more than we used to?

好吗  你们觉得如何  蓝色或棕色西装012---Okay, what do you think? This blue suit or this brown one?
棕色能衬托你的眼睛012---Well, the brown one brings out your eyes.
但你的屁股比较适合穿蓝色的012---But your butt looks great in the blue one.
真的吗012---Really?
阿斯匹灵舞真的有用012---Wow. That aspirin dance really works.
天啊  你还是会… 我很好012---Ow. Oh, my God. Is that still? I'm fine. I'm fine.
不  才怪  我很好012---No, you're not. Yes, I am.

我相信你会让大家留下深刻印象  "嗨 我是瑞秋葛林"012---Yeah, and I'm sure you're gonna make a great impression. "Hi, I'm Rachel.
"幸会"012---It's nice to meet you."
少来了  你可能断了一根肋骨012---Come on, you probably have a broken rib.
明天我会去医院的  到时候我的肋骨还不是断的012---Well, I will go to the hospital tomorrow. It'll still be broken then.
但我需要人帮我做准备012---But you know, I could use a hand getting ready.
瑞秋  听着  不帮我就滚出去012---Rachel. Look, either help me or go.
好吧  我走就是012---Fine. I'll go.

我不想化得太浓  低调一点012---I don't want it to be too much. I want it to be subtle.
你画再多都不够012---You know, you don't wear enough of this.
什么时候  你觉得我需要化妆了012---Since when...? Since when do you think I don't wear enough of this?
闭上眼睛  我想你会比较喜欢这样  因为…012---Well, I... Close your eye. I just think you're gonna like this better because...
闭上眼睛  吹一下012---Close, close. Blow it.
抱歉012---Sorry.

我得告诉你一件事012---Ooh, I have to tell you something.
什么  我不能跟你说012---What? Well, I can't tell you.
好啊  把不能说的事说出来  应该会比较轻松一点吧012---Okay, but wouldn't it be easier to tell me something that you could tell me?
在完美世界里  当然是的012---Well, sure, in a perfect world.
不   我发誓我不会说的  我跟所有神明都发誓过了012---But no. I promised I wouldn't tell, and I swore to, like, all my gods.

从你的肚脐眼吸出迷你棉花糖012---I sucked that mini-marshmallow out of your bellybutton.
对  那不一样  当时我们是男女朋友012---Yeah, but that was different, you know? We were going out then.

我爱你们两个012---I love you both.
但那是不一样的爱012---But in very different ways.
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
你在做什么  我以为你会送她回去012---What are you doing? I though you were gonna take her back.
我有啊  但老板不接受退货012---I did. But the store wouldn't take her back.
后来我带她去收容所  你知道我发现了什么012---So then I took her to the shelter. And you know what I found out?
要是找不到人领养  就要杀了她012---If they can't find a home for her, they kill her.
我不能让小亚丝敏有那样的下场012---And I'm not gonna let that happen to little Yasmine.
好啊012---Okay, good, good, good.
因为我也很犹豫012---Because I was kind of having second thoughts too.
好吧  不只是小鸡  所有动物都一样012---Okay. And it's not just chicks, you know? It's all kinds of other animals.
真的很可怕  你这么做是对的012---That's horrible. Well, you did the right thing, man.
谢谢  我很高兴你是那么想的012---Thanks. I'm glad you see it that way.
喔  非常有趣012---Oh, funny story.
我不敢相信012---I don't believe this.

彼特  好吧  我爱你  有这么糟吗012---Pete? Okay, I love you. Is that so bad?

真的很棒012---It's really nice.
听着  唯一会受伤害的人是我  我都可以接受012---Look, the only one who stands to get hurt is me, and I'm okay with that.
对  或许你可以接受被伤害012---Yeah, you may be okay with getting hurt...
但我不想当个那伤害你的人012---...but I am not okay with being the one who hurts you.
所以我不能接受这份工作  什么012---That's why I can't take this job. What?
或许我们不该再见面了012---Well, we probably shouldn't see each other anymore.
对不起012---I'm sorry.
好吧012---Okay. Yeah.
我是说  如果你真的想这么做  好吧012---I mean, if that's really what you want, okay.
好吧  再见012---Okay. Bye.
我很遗憾我们无法…012---I'm sorry things didn't work out...
你先闭嘴  让我确定一件事012---Shut up for a second and let me just see something.
好吧  你没跟我说实话  对吧012---Okay, you'd tell me the truth, right?
瑞秋  你的X光片看起来不胖  好吧012---Rach, you can't look fat in an x-ray. Okay.
给我待在那里  好好反省一下012---Hey, now, you stay out here and you think about what you did.
那是一只鸭子  一只坏鸭子012---That's a duck. That's a bad duck.
今晚你还好吧  罗斯  那是…不012---How'd the thing go tonight, Ross? Oh, it was... No, no.

今晚我原本要上探索频道的节目012---Aw, I was kind of supposed to be on TV tonight for the Discovery Channel.
天啊012---Oh, my God.
罗斯  为什么你不告诉我012---Ross, why didn't you tell me that?
我知道我跟你说的话  你会坚持我一定要去012---Ah, I knew that if I told you, you'd make me go...
我知道今晚你需要人陪你  来吧012---...and I knew you needed someone to be with you tonight. Come on.
来吧  我不敢相信你012---Come on. I cannot believe you.
什么  你对我太好了012---What? That is the sweetest thing.
你该睡一下012---You should get some sleep.

小鸡呢012---What about the chick?
小鸡不会游泳012---Chicks don't swim.
你确定012---Are you sure?
我不知道012---I don't know.
我们该试试看吗   当然012---Should we try? Sure.
看吧  我就说他们不会游泳012---See, I told you. They don't swim.

他们就不会免费修理我的破电话了012---...they're not gonna fix my crappy, broken phone for free.
不能让他们赢  这是我们与他们的对决012---We cannot let them win. It's us versus them.
没错012---Yes.
嘿  嗨012---Hey. Hi.

这真是…012---So, uh... Well, this is, uh...
有点尴尬012---This is awkward.
是吗012---Yeah?
因为瑞秋和我交往过012---Well, you know, because Rachel and I used to go out. Ha, ha.
我不知道012---Oh, I didn't know that.
那这才叫尴尬012---Well, then this is awkward.
座位是… 应该是这里012---So, what do you? Oh. Yeah. I think we're here. Yeah.
打扰一下  对不起012---Excuse me. I'm sorry.
你们好像坐到我们的位子了012---I think you may be in our seats.

可以看下你的票吗  当然可以012---Could we take a look at your ticket? Sure.
没错  这是D13012---Yeah. Yeah, see, this says, "D-13."
而… 我以为…012---And... Oh, well, I thought that...
你以为  是吧  你以为也没有用  白痴012---You thought, huh? Yeah, well, that didn't really work out too well for you. Idiot!
你是有病吗  上面印的是D13   好吗012---What are you, a moron? Huh? It says, "D-13." Okay?
你被双数包围了  你都没有察觉到吗012---Look, you're surrounded by even numbers. Does that give you some clue?
带位的人说  带位的人当然对了012---Well, the usher told me... Oh. Oh, the usher must be right.

你演得好棒012---You were great.
你们觉得怎样012---So? So? What'd you think?
跟两裸女坐翘翘板那出剧有得拼012---Almost as good as the play with the two naked girls on the seesaw.
我没有演  我知道012---I wasn't in that. I know.
嘿  凯特  各位  她是凯特012---Hey, Kate, listen I want you to meet everybody. Everybody, this is Kate.

那就是你喜欢的女生012---So that's the girl you like.
说真的  瑞秋的男伴是神经病012---I'm telling you, this guy Rachel is with is crazy, okay?
他对陌生人大吼大叫012---He viciously screamed at total strangers.
我觉得他很糟糕012---I think he's bad news.
等一下  你不喜欢瑞秋的约会对象012---Wait a minute, wait a minute. You don't like the guy Rachel's dating?
奇怪啊012---Well, that's odd.
嘿  萝伦  各位  这是凯特的候补演员萝伦012---Oh, hey, Lauren. Uh, you guys, this is Kate's understudy, Lauren.
嗨  嗨  天哪  你好眼熟012---Hi. Hey, gosh, you look so familiar.
我们在你那栋楼的走廊上见过012---Oh, yeah. I ran into you in the hallway in your building.
就在我跟乔伊上床之后  第二天就甩了我012---It was right after I slept with Joey. He dumped me the next day.
你们是怎么认识的012---So how'd you guys meet?
简单的说  我追了她两个月012---Well, uh, the short version is, I pursued her for a couple of months.
给她一张两万美元的支票后  就搞定了012---Then I gave her a check for $20,000 and she was mine.
复杂点说  我因为他说话太简单  而甩了他012---Yeah, and in the long version, I dump him for telling people the short version.
乔伊  宝贝  你太棒了012---Joey, sweetheart, you were fabulous.

她们有经纪人吗012---Do they have representation?
她们没有演012---They weren't in the play.
我们不是演员  真可惜012---Huh. We're not actors. ESTELLE: Oh. What a shame.
她的脸蛋加上她的胸部012---Because with her face and her chest...
我可以捧出个明星来012---...I could really put something together.
可以借我吗012---Could I borrow it?
嗨  记得我吗012---Hi. Remember me?
是你  汤米在排队上厕所012---Hi. Yeah. Ahem, Tommy's in line for the bathroom...
有人插队  我觉得他要抓狂了012---...and someone just cut in front of him. I think he's gonna snap.
罗斯  我要走了  走  为什么012---Ross, I'm gonna go. Go? Why?
不知道  或许是因为…012---I don't know. Could be because I don't feel like...
我不想整晚等着看一个人  会不会发疯012---...standing around all night, waiting for some guy who may or may not scream.
但是  凯琳…012---Oh, but Cailin...
他绝对会发疯012---...he definitely will scream.

我受伤了012---I am hurt.
祝你们两家…012---A plague...
发生灾难012---...on both your houses.
对了  他看完我的剧评之后  把我甩了012---By the way, he dumped me tonight after he read my review.
真过分012---Oh, classy.
是啊012---Yep.
是啊  我还真有眼光012---I sure know how to pick them, huh?
我为了这出戏  放弃了一个连续剧012---You know I gave up a part on a soap for this?
我也放弃了一个工作012---Yeah, I, uh... I gave up a job too.
什么工作  替猫味剪指甲012---Really? What? Uh, declawing cats.
这样吧   我陪你走回家012---Hey, tell you what, let me walk you home.
我们去每个报摊  烧掉所有的《时代杂志》和《邮报》012---We'll stop by every newsstand and burn every copy of their Times and The Post.
为什么要烧《邮报》  你没看《邮报》012---Why The Post? You didn't see The Post?

等一下  怎么了012---Wait. Wait a minute. What?
我实在搞不懂你012---I don't get you.
你先是讨厌我012---I mean, first you hate me.
然后跟我上床012---Then you sleep with me.
然后你又跟我撇清关系  现在又想要我了012---Then you want nothing to do with me. Now you want me again?
怎样   你没跟女演员约过会吗012---What? So you never went out with an actress before?
凯特  你喜欢我吗012---Kate, do you even like me?
当然喜欢  那你之前为什么拒绝我012---Of course I do. So how come you blew me off?
为什么要跟他在一起   我不知道012---You know, how come you were with him? I don't know.
我就是这样012---I just do this.
我总是要挑最聪明的…012---I always have to pick, like, the smartest guy...
或是最有才华的012---...or the most talented guy.
我为什么不能挑你这种人012---Why can't I just pick someone like you?
谢了012---Thanks.
你知道我的意思012---You know what I mean.

你已经二十四小时没睡了  去睡吧012---Pheebs, you've been up for 24 hours. Go to sleep, honey.
这样很不健康  不  我很好012---This isn't healthy. No, no, I'm fine.
你知道为什么吗  因为我吃了核黄素012---And you know why? Because of all the riboflavin.
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.

后来她昏过去了012---Then she passed out.
但是她醒来之后012---But then she woke up. Yeah.
我们聊了一整晚012---And we stayed up all night talking.
我们现在为彼此而疯狂012---And now we're, like, totally crazy about each other.
你经历了"爱之夜"  什么012---Joey, you had "the night." What?
当两个人发现坠人爱河后012---When two people finally realize their feelings for each other...
他们会聊上很久  弄清楚对方的一切012---...and they talk for hours and they learn all about the other person.
是吗012---You think?
你知道她家人的事吗  两个兄弟  一个死了012---Ha, ha. Did you learn about her family? Two brothers. One died.
太棒了  好012---Yes. Yeah.

好吧  我觉得  你不该跟汤米继续来往012---All right, I don't think you should be seeing Tommy anymore.
是吗  对012---You don't? No.
那家伙态度很恶劣  非常恶劣  你应该离他远一点012---The guy is mean. I mean, really mean. I think you should stay away from him.
或许我应该离所有男人远一点012---Hmm. Or maybe I should stay away from all men.
我不只是在嫉妒012---No, it's not just because I'm jealous.
我不是在嫉妒012---I mean, I'm not, I'm not. I'm not jealous, okay?
那家伙…012---Look, the guy, he screamed...
对坐错位子的夫妇大吼012---...he actually screamed at this couple sitting in our seats.
对啊   落幕的时候…012---Yeah, and at the end of the play, he...
他还站起来  用力拍打双手012---He got up, you know, and he just started, like, banging his hands together.
好  你们不信就算了012---Okay, fine. Fine. You don't want to believe me, no, that's fine.

800才是免付费电话   801是犹他州码012---Phoebe, 800 is toll free. 801 is Utah.
不…012---No, no, no.
一定是800  大公司都有免付费专线012---It has to be 800 because all those big companies have 800 numbers.
每个…012---Every...
犹他州大公司都是801开头012---Yeah, every big Utah-based company has one.
菲比012---Phoebe.
真的很抱歉  我会付钱的012---Sorry. I'm so sorry. I will pay you back.
她还是不挂电话012---And yet she's still not hanging up the phone.
挂掉吧   挂电话012---Hang up. Hang up the phone.
好啦012---Fine. Fine.
怎么了012---What?
我好像把它摔坏了012---Well, I think I broke it.
没关系   你们可以打这个号码012---But that's all right. Here's the number where you can call.
要是我们的鸡和鸭生小宝宝不是很有趣吗012---Hey, wouldn't it be cool if our duck and our chick had a little baby?
可以叫他查克012---We could call it Chuck.
或狄克(阴茎)012---Or Dick.
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
嘿  我要请你们帮忙012---Listen, I need a favor.
我刚才在洗澡  正在…012---I was in the shower, and as I was...
冲洗时  我感觉到点东西012---...cleansing myself, I, uh... Well, I felt something.
很像打喷嚏  但是感觉更爽012---Was it like a sneeze, only better?
不是  是我身上长了东西012---No, no. I mean, like, a thing on my body.
什么东西012---Well, what was it?
不知道  它长在我不能…012---Well, I don't know. It's kind of in a place that's not...
我看不到  我想麻烦你们…012---It's not visually accessible to me. And I was hoping maybe you guys...
帮我看-下012---...could help me out.
不要012---Whoa! Whoa! No.

那是青春痘吗012---Ew. Is it...? What, a pimple?
不是  它…012---No, it's...
比青春痘更高档012---...fancier than a pimple.
你就去看医… 你们在干……012---Look, Ross, just go see a doc... Guys, what's...?

嘿  文斯是消防员012---Hey. Vince is a fireman.
你从燃烧的大楼里救过人吗012---Wow. Have you ever rescued anyone from a burning building before?
九十八次  队里第一012---Ninety-eight hot saves. Highest on the force.
要是乔伊和我玩火柴012---Well, you know, if Joey and I play with matches...
就可以让你累积到一百次012---...we could get you up to an even 100.
孩子  不能拿火灾开玩笑012---Fire safety is not a joke, son. Ha, ha. Oh.
你说得对  我知道012---You're right. I know.
我要走了  晚上要值班012---Look, I gotta go. I'm on call tonight.
星期六见  好012---See you Saturday. Okay.
菲比  他好可爱012---Wow, he's cute, Pheebs.
但你不是刚和那个幼稚园老师开始交往了吗012---But I thought you just started dating that teacher.
杰森  是啊012---Oh, Jason? Yeah.
我们晚上要见面012---Uh-huh. We're seeing each other tonight. Ahem.
菲比012---Well, Pheebs?
脚踏两条船  你不像这种人012---Two dates in one day? That's so unlike you.
我知道  我只是喜欢拈花惹草而已012---I know, I know. I'm, like, playing the field, you know?
我在玩弄别人  三心二意012---I'm juggling two guys. I'm sowing my wild oats, you know?
我是三心二意的花心大萝卜012---You know, this kind of, like, you know, oat-sowing, field-playing juggler.
他们知道对方的存在吗012---So, Pheebs, do they know about each other?
狗狗念书时   嘴唇会动吗012---Does a dog's lips move when he reads?
他们不知道012---Okay, no, they don't know.
各位  嘿012---Hey, guys. Hi.
怎样  医生怎么说012---Well? How'd it go at the doctor's?
他说不用担心  是良性的012---Well, he said there's definitely nothing to worry about. It's totally benign.
是什么  他根本说不出来012---Well, what is it? He couldn't even tell me.
他只说是一种皮肤异常012---He said it was just some sort of skin abnormality.
更糟的是  他说  由于无法辨认012---And the worse thing is, he said not being able to identify it...
他不愿意为我切除012---...he was reluctant to remove it.
你应该去找我的医生012---You know what? You should go to my guy.
我带着第三个乳头去找他时…012---Because when I went in there with my third nipple...
他直接就把它给切了  是啊012---...he just lopped it right off, you know? Yeah?
我还蛮幸运的012---So I guess I'm lucky. Heh.
虽然比不上天生只有两个乳头的人012---I mean, not as lucky as people who are born with two nipples.
至少他们知道你长了什么  你的有名字012---At least they knew what yours was. You know? Yours had a name.
也许医学界会以你为名012---Oh. Maybe they'll name yours after you.
把它叫做罗斯012---You know? They'd call it The Ross.
大家会说 "噢  他长了一个罗斯"012---And then people would be, like, "Oh, he's got a Ross."
是啊  真酷012---Yeah, that'd be cool.
彼特要跟我分手012---Pete's breaking up with me.
什么012---What?
我刚才听留言012---Yeah, I just checked my messages.
等他从亚特兰大回来  "我们得谈一谈"012---He said that when he gets back from Atlanta, "We need to talk."
然后呢  就这样012---And? Well, that's it.
没有人会说我们得谈一谈   除非是坏事012---People never say, "We need to talk," unless it's something bad.
那不一定代表他要跟你分手012---Whoa. That doesn't necessarily mean he's breaking up with you.
是啊  真的012---Yeah. Really?
也许他只是劈腿012---Yeah. Maybe he just cheated on you.
这么做不会让我变富裕  但我还是很高兴012---And I know I'll never get rich doing it, but I gotta tell you, it's pretty cool...
我正在改变一个孩子的人生012---...knowing you're making a difference in a kid's life.
真好012---That is so great.
天哪012---Oh, my God. Oh.
天哪012---Oh, my God! Ooh.
赶快通知消防队  不012---Uh, we'd better call the fire department. No. No.
不  不必找消防员吧012---No, no? Well, we don't need a fireman.
应该找好的技工来012---We need, like, a good mechanic.
他们来了  快走012---Oh, my God. Here they come. We gotta get out of here.
等一下  为什么012---Wait. Why?
要是我想看消防员  我会找消防员约会  好吗012---Look, if I wanted to see a fireman, I would date one, okay?
只是一个多出来的乳头012---That's all it is, a third nipple.
很普通的第三个乳头012---You know? Just your run-of-the-mill third nipple. Yeah.
你可以把它切掉   直接切掉012---You can take it off. Just slice that baby right off.
把上衣脱掉让我看一下012---Take your shirt off and let's see what we're dealing with here.
你在干什么012---What are you doing?
让你看那个非常普通  可以直接切掉的乳头012---Just showing you my run-of-the-mill, slice-it-right-off third nipple.
这不是第三个乳头012---Well, that's not a third nipple. Oh?
首先  它长在你的屁股上012---First of all, it's on your ass.
不然是什么012---Well, then what is it?
等一下012---Wait a minute. Hold it.
詹森  麻烦来一下  我在跟汉弥顿讲话012---Jansen, will you come in here a moment? JANSEN: I'm with Hamilton.
他对怪东西很在行  叫他也来012---He's good with weird things. Bring him in too.
我得去帮彼特浇花012---I gotta go water Pete's plants.
你们知道吗  如果他想分手  我就不浇了012---You know what? If he's gonna break up with me, maybe I won't water his plants.
如果他要分手  干脆让乔伊和我去浇012---Well, if he's gonna break up with you, maybe Joey and I should water his plants...
懂我的意思吧012---...if you know what I mean.
又或者… 我们可以对着花盆撒尿012---Or, ha, ha......we could go over there and pee on them.
我受不了了012---I can't take it, you know?
我怕会被捉到012---I'm always afraid one of them is gonna catch me with the other.
我快疯了012---It's making me crazy.
那为什么不跟其中一个分手012---Well, honey, why don't you break up with one of them?
你不是在拈花惹草吗012---Whoa, whoa, whoa. What happened to playing the field?
现在不好玩了012---Well, it doesn't feel like playing anymore.
比较像工作  很累人012---It's feels like work. It's like I'm working in the field.
那就选一个  对啊  你比较喜欢哪一个012---So, Pheebs, pick one of them. Yeah, which one do you like more?
文斯很棒  他是男人中的男人012---Well, Vince is great, you know? Because he's, like, a "guy" guy.
他好壮  真的好壮012---You know? He's just so burly, so very burly.
好  那就选文斯吧012---Okay, good. So there you go. Go with Vince.
但是杰森好感性012---Yeah, but Jason's really sensitive.
感性很重要  选他012---Well, sensitive is important. Pick him. Yeah.
是啊  听娘娘腔的话012---Oh, sure. Go with the sissy.
杰森才不娘娘腔012---Jason is not a sissy.
不是啦  我是说钱德012---Oh, no, no, no. I meant Chandler.
我晚上有约012---You know, I have dinner plans.
谢谢各位临时赶来012---Thank you so much for coming on such a short notice.
各位先生  女士  我行医二十三年012---Ladies and gentlemen, I've been practicing medicine for 23 years...
现在却被难倒了012---...and I'm stumped.
这里是书房012---Okay, this is the den.
你们看  灯光…012---All right, check this out. Lights.
少一点光…不好的光012---Whoa. All right, less lights. Bad lights.
灯光移开012---Lights, go away.
看到了吗  下对指令就行了012---Aw, see? You just need to find the right command.
也可以用调的012---Yes. And the dimmer switch.
他那么有钱   电视还真小012---Whoa. For a rich guy, that's a pretty small TV.
那是视讯电话012---No, no, no. That's the videophone.
你们根本不该在这里的  所以不要乱碰东西012---But hey, guys, you're not supposed to be here, so please don't touch anything.
宜家家居  好舒服012---IKEA, this is comfortable.
这里太高级了012---This place is amazing.
那个厨房是我见过最赞的  我知道012---Oh, God. That is the nicest kitchen. I know.
我是说真的012---No, no. It's the nicest kitchen.
冰箱还会祝我今天愉快012---The refrigerator told me to have a great day.
你们看   百万富翁的支票簿012---Look at this, a millionaire's checkbook.
乔伊  把那个放下012---Joey, put that down.
天哪  是彼特  快出去012---Oh, my God, that's Pete. Okay, get out.
视讯电话要怎么接  摩妮卡012---How the hell do you answer a videophone? Monica?
原来是这样012---I guess that's how.
摩妮卡  你好吗012---Hey, Monica, how's it going?
呃…很好012---Oh, it's good. It's, um... It's good.
我来帮你浇花012---Just here, watering the plants.

彼特…012---Uh, Pete, um...
那天你说要找我谈一谈012---The other day when you said you needed to talk...
请问是好消息还是坏消息012---...um, just so I know, is it good news or bad news?
好消息  绝对是好消息012---Oh, it's good news. No, it's definitely good news.
等一下  有另一个电话012---Hold on a second, I have another call.
你好吗012---Hey, how's it going?
还是我012---No, no, no, it's still me.
我这里有子画面012---No, it's not. I've got picture-in-picture here.

你得办一个主题婚礼012---No, Mon, you have to make it a theme wedding.
主题可以是…012---And the theme could be:
"看我们多有钱啊"012---"Look How Much Money We've Got."
你可以在喜帖里放钱012---You know? I mean, you could put money in the invitations.
你可以用钱做成餐具012---You could have, like, little-money place settings.
第一道菜可以上钞票沙拉012---And, uh, you could start with a money salad.
虽然干了点  但绝对受欢迎012---I mean, it'll be dry, but people will like it.
别再说了012---Would you stop?
我们才交往两星期  也不知道他会不会求婚012---We've only gone out a couple of weeks. We don't know if he'll propose.
他是彼特   跟别人不一样012---Yes, but this is Pete, okay? He's not like other people.
你们第一次约会就去了罗马012---On your first date, he took you to Rome.
对其他男人来说  那是第三 四次约会的事012---For most guys, that's like a third or fourth date kind of thing.

我很喜欢文斯  但杰森好感性012---Yeah. I like Vince a lot, you know? But Jason is so sensitive, you know?
长期来说  感性应该比…012---And in the long run, I think sensitive is better than having...
这么  这么性感的身材来得好012---...just, like, a really, really, really nice body.
杰森   绝对是杰森012---Jason. Definitely Jason.
祝我好运吧  祝好运012---Wish me luck.Good luck.
天啊012---Oh, my God.
抱歉   我在想像接到钞票抛花的感觉012---Sorry. I was just imagining what it'd be like to catch the money bouquet.
抱歉  文斯在吗012---Excuse me. Um, is Vince here?
在012---Oh, sure.
文斯  来了012---Vince. Yo.

什么事012---So, what's up?
这件事很难说出口012---This isn't gonna be easy. Um...
我们还是别再见面了012---I don't think we should see each other anymore.
很好012---Good deal.
对不起   没关系012---I'm sorry. No, it's okay.
我还以为我们之间很特别012---It's just that, uh, I thought we had something pretty special here.
我以为终于找到了可以倾诉的对象012---An you know, I felt like you were someone I could finally open up to.
我还有好多事没跟你分享012---There's so much in me I haven't shared with you yet.
天哪  我不知道你… 抱歉  我说不出话来了012---Oh, my God. I didn't know you were so... I'm sorry. I can't talk.
我要去写日记012---I'm gonna go write in my journal.
等一下012---Wait. Wait. Wait.
我说了  你如果想解决那个问题  就去找我的药草师012---I'm telling you, if you wanna take care of that thing, go see my herbal guy.
谢了  我是想切除  不是想做成香料012---Thank you, but I wanna remove it, Pheebs. I don't wanna make it savory.
当女生与长了怪东西的男人睡过之后012---You know, when girls sleep with guys with weird things on their body...
都会跟朋友讲012---...they tell their friends about it.
拿来012---Give me that.
别生我的气  但我就是忍不住012---Hi. Okay, don't be mad at me, but I couldn't resist.
新娘杂志012---Bride's magazines?
我知道你不会答应求婚012---Yes, and I know that you said you'd say no if he asked you...
但是穿这套唐娜凯伦走红毯012---...but I'm sorry, how great would you look walking down the aisle...
该有多美啊012---...in this Donna Karan?
一定会很美012---Oh, you so would.
不结婚也要买012---Oh, you should get that anyway.
可以穿去夜店012---Well, for clubbing.
真的很奇怪…012---It is so weird.
我说过不会答应  但是今天早上…012---I know what I said. But, um, this morning...
我躺在床上想像说愿意的感觉012---...I was lying in bed, I was imagining what it'd be like to say yes.
我知道有点突然  也很匆促012---I know it's a little sudden, and it's rushed...
我也不是会做这种事的人012---...and it's totally not like me to do something like this.
但这不意味着  我不能做  对吧012---But that doesn't mean I can't. Right?
毕竟我那么爱彼特012---I mean, I'm crazy about Pete.
我们追求同样的东西012---And I know that we want the same things.
当我想到说愿意的感觉…012---And when I thought about saying yes...
让我觉得很快乐012---...it made me really happy.
天哪012---Oh, my God.
我知道012---I know.
我需要更多派012---I need more pie.
要是你真的结婚   我可以带两个人去吗012---Hey, Mon, um, if you do get married, can I bring two guests?
你没跟消防员分手012---You didn't break up with that fireman?
没有  我的话  就是这个意思012---No, that was my way of telling you.
其实他非常感性012---Well, it turns out he's incredibly sensitive.
他写日记  还画画012---He keeps a journal and he paints.
他还为我画了一幅炭笔画012---He even showed me charcoal drawings that he drew of me.
他想用水彩画  但是他很容易搞到黑炭012---He'd prefer watercolors, but, you know, he has easy access to a lot of charcoal.
那你要甩掉杰森吗012---So then are you gonna dump Jason?
对  我总得跟其中一个分手012---Well, yeah, because I have to break up with someone and...
杰森很感性  但文斯也是012---Okay, so Jason is sensitive. But now, so is Vince.
而文斯又有身材012---Plus Vince has the body. You know?
所以……012---So...
这其实只是数学问题012---It's really just about the math.
杰森   请进012---Jason. Yeah, come on in.
你在电话里的语气很严肃012---Uh, Phoebe, you sounded serious on the phone.
出了什么事吗012---Is, uh, anything wrong?
没事012---No.
你一定是罗斯012---You must be Ross.
你好  我是萨吉大师012---Hi. I am Guru Saj.
老实说  我以前从未找过大师  所以…012---Listen, I gotta tell you, I've never been to a guru before, so...
放轻松  我在中美洲念过很好的医学院012---Well, relax. If it makes you feel any better, I've attended...
这样你比较安心了吧012---...some of the finest medical schools in Central America.
来看看你的皮肤异常吧012---Well, then, let's take a look at this skin abnormality of yours.
请坐012---Come on, have a seat.
跟我想的一样   是昆度斯012---Aha. As I suspected, it's a kundus.
什么是昆度斯012---What's a "kundus"?
不知道   昆度斯对你来说是什么012---I don't know. What's a kundus with you?
请趴下012---Please lie down.
我有一种药膏可以让它缩小012---I've got a salve that ought to shrink that right up.
值得一试012---Well, I guess it's worth a try.
那当然  效果应该…012---Oh, sure. We should see results...
噢  显然不能这么做012---Whoa! Clearly not the way to go.
为什么012---What? What?
我们似乎惹它生气了012---We appear to have angered it.
我们  惹它生气了012---We? We angered it?
我看到问题在哪里了012---Oh. I think I see the problem.
恐怕我们得动用  更有力的手段012---And I'm afraid we're gonna have to use a much stronger tool.
爱012---Love.

可以吃饭了吗012---Can we please go eat?
要吃什么  不要吃炖肉就好012---Yeah, what are we getting? Anything but stew.
从今以后  别让你的上司逮到机会012---So from now on, don't give your boss a chance to get you.
别把背部对着他012---Don't turn your back to him.
也可以给他一个教训012---Or you could teach him a lesson, you know?
你可以在屁股上涂很臭的东西012---What you do is rub something that smells really bad on your butt, right?
他拍了你之后  手就会很臭012---Then when he goes to smack you, his hand will smell.

我目前根本没打算要喜欢别人012---I actually wasn't expecting to like anyone right now.
但她真的很棒012---But she's really terrific.
真糟糕012---It's too bad.
我是说我喜欢她012---No, I'm saying I liked her.
你不必为一颗树放弃整片森林012---There are other fish in the sea.
菲比  我觉得她很棒  我们要再约会012---I think she's great, okay? We're going out again.
我听到了  你可以谈点别的吗012---I hear you. Are you capable of talking about anything else?
我的火鸡汉堡在哪里012---Which one's my turkey burger?
在我脚边  抱歉012---The one next to my foot. Sorry.
比赛开始了  我们马上进去012---Fight's starting! We'll be right in.
你的上司今天又打你屁屁了吗012---So did your boss try to slap you again today?
九次012---Nine times.
害我得擦护肤液012---I had to put on lotion.
不过没关系  我明天要做个实验012---But it'll be okay. Tomorrow, I conduct an experiment.
要是顺利  我的屁股  就没人会拍了012---And if all goes as planned, my butt will be smack-free.
比赛结束012---Fight's over!
不好意思   道格012---Excuse me, Doug?
超级体育迷012---Hey there, sports fan!
宾   数据做好了吗012---Bing! You got those numbers for me?
没有  我没做012---No. I didn't do them.
你忘了012---Oh. You forgot?
不是   我就是没做012---No, I just didn't do them.
我跟朋友出去  喝了两杯012---Instead, I hung out with some friends and had a couple of beers.
所以我不值得表扬  不管是言语上…012---So I certainly don't deserve praise. Verbal...
或其他方式012---...or otherwise.
我昨晚也醉了  是某个美女送我回家的012---I got tanked myself last night. Pretty dicey drive home.
塔本吉桥变得好小012---Tappan Zee Bridge never looked smaller. Ha, ha.
没关系  你还是我头号爱将  宾012---That's okay. You're still my number one guy! Bing!
道格012---Doug! Hmm?
我对你表达自我的方式  感觉有点不舒服012---I'm a little bit uncomfortable with the way that you express yourself.
你是说我经常骂脏话吗012---Is it the swearing? Is it the constant swearing?
如果是的话  你可以去死吧012---Because I gotta tell you, if it is, you can just kiss my ass!
不是骂脏话的事  而是…012---No. It's not about the swearing. It's more about...
你偶尔会…012---...the way that you occasionally...
把热情集中在…012---...concentrate your enthusiasm...
我的屁股上012---...on my buttocks.
别误会   我了解你的情绪012---Don't get me wrong, I appreciate the sentiment.
只不过我的臀部很敏感012---It's just that I have a rather sensitive posterior.
而且别人都在嫉妒012---And besides, it's making all the other guys jealous.
别再说了  你讲这些话  确实很有种012---Well, say no more. You know, it takes guts to bring this up.
宾  很好012---Bing, you're okay.
你要住在满身大汗的巨人的上衣口袋012---Would you rather live in the shirt pocket of a sweaty giant...
还是他的排水管里012---...or inside his shower drain?
天哪012---Oh, my God.
你看   是罗斯和那个女的012---Look. It's Ross and that girl.
看  有排蚂蚁  他们在同心协力  菲比012---Look at that! It's a line of ants! They're working as a team!
噢  对  罗斯好像要跟她分手了012---Right. Oh, yeah. It looks like Ross is breaking up with her.
希望他不要太狠012---I hope he lets her down easy.
你看  他们没有要分手  看看他们012---Look at that! They are not breaking up! Look at them!
那是第二次约会012---You know what that is? A second date, that's what that is.
你看  她把手放到他的大腿上012---Look, she just put her hand on his thigh.
小意思  她在性方面很主动012---That's nothing. She's very sexually aggressive.
天哪012---Oh, God!
都是你不好  他爱上她了  他会娶她   都是你的错012---It's your fault. Now he loves her. He'll marry her. It's all your fault.
你自己说没关系的012---You said it was okay.
你说她以前是光头012---You said she was bald!
是以前…012---Was! Was, was, was!
我们得想个办法   拆散他们012---We can't let it happen. We have to do something. We have to break them up.
进去帮她剃光头  你欠我一个光头女012---Just go in there and shave her head! You owe me one bald girl!
你先深呼吸012---Okay, first of all, breathe.
再来  我实在不懂012---Second of all, I don't get it.
不是你决定要跟罗斯分手的吗012---Aren't you the one that decided you didn't want to be with Ross?
是的012---Yes.
他不是你的朋友吗   你不希望他快乐吗012---Well, isn't he your friend? Don't you want him to be happy?
希望012---Yes.
所以呢012---So?
但是我没想到这么快  他就这么开心了012---It's just, you know, I didn't expect him to be this happy so soon.
完了  怎么了012---Oh, no. What?
蚂蚁被我们压死了012---We killed them all!
没这么严重   这是以防万一012---It's not as bad as it looks. It's a precaution.
我的脊椎骨不能动012---I'm not supposed to move my spine.
你要放弃了吧012---Please tell me you're stopping now.
我没事   今晚要我上场都行012---I'm fine. I'd fight tonight if they'd let me.
你看这个圆012---Now, see this circle I'm marking off here?
这是我的恐怖区012---This is my Zone of Terror.
你疯了  你一定要放弃012---You are insane! You've got to give this up!
除非我拿到格斗冠军   我才会放弃012---I can't until I'm the Ultimate Fighter.
我会成功的012---I will do it.
总有一天小朋友  会争辩我和超人…012---The day will come when children will argue over who will win a fight...
谁会打赢012---...me or Superman.
我赢不过超人  不过小孩子都很笨012---Not that I could beat Superman, but kids are stupid.
你先坐下012---Just sit down.
听我说012---Please listen to me.
你打得很烂   你是史上  最烂的终极格斗手012---You are terrible at this, okay? You are the worst Ultimate Fighter ever.
最烂的012---Ever!
我的肌腱套破裂  右前臂有轻微骨折012---I have a torn rotator cuff, a hairline fracture in my right forearm...
喉结严重瘀伤  但你的话最伤人012---...and a severely bruised Adam's apple, but that really hurt.
你知道吗012---Well, then you know what?
我关心你  没办法看你这样伤害自己012---I care about you too much to watch you hurt yourself like this.
要是你非打不可  我就不能在你身边陪你012---So if you have to do this, you'll have to do it without me.
如果你要我放弃012---If you're asking me to quit...
就是要我违背本性012---...then you're asking me to be someone I'm not.
我非打不可012---I've got to do this.
那我要走了012---Then I've gotta go.
再见012---Bye.
摩妮卡   是的012---Monica? Yes?
你可以留张字条吗   我服了止痛药012---Could you leave a note? I'm on painkillers...
明天可能会忘记这件事012---...and I might not remember this tomorrow.
总而言之   曲线节节上升  我很满意012---So, in conclusion, the lines all go up, so I'm happy.
做得好  明天八点半见012---Great job, team! Tomorrow at 8:30.
菲尔  干得好  史蒂芬  漂亮012---Phil, nice job! Stevens, way to go!
戈博  你这个疯子012---Goldberg, you maniac!
我爱你012---I love you!
宾  没有你可不行  谢谢012---Bing, couldn't have done it without you. Thank you, sir.
抱歉012---Oh, excuse me.
我忘了拿公事包  不小心的012---I forgot my briefcase, you know, by accident.
当然是不小心的  你还忘了一件事012---Of course you did. Forgot something else too, you bastard!
你呢012---Well, what about you?
不会觉得被冷落了吧012---You're not feeling left out, are you?
一点也不会  别闹了012---No. Heh. No, not at all. That's ridiculous.
大家都有  你也想来一下  对吧012---Everybody else got one, and you want one too. Don't you?
没错012---Yes, I do. Ha-ha-ha.
给我滚吧012---Now, get on out of here, you!
彼特贝克烧着格斗场012---Pete Becker circles the ring.
似乎想弄清楚自己的情势012---Looks like he's just trying to feel him out.
重伤害进攻了012---Bruiser is charging!
快逃啊  你这有钱佬的怪胎疯子012---Run, you crazy, rich freak!
我不敢看012---I can't watch this.
你看  彼特要赢了012---Check it out! Pete's winning!
真的吗   才怪012---Really? No!
彪形大汉把贝克打倒在地  向他最喜欢的部位进攻012---Uh-oh, Bruiser has Becker on the canvas and is going for his favorite area!
既然是最喜欢的部位  为何要下这种毒手012---Wait! If that's his favorite area, why is he being so mean to it?
真是讽刺012---This is ironic.
你的前任男友理查不想生小孩012---Your last boyfriend, Richard, didn't want to have kids.
现在看情况  彼特也是不能生了012---And from the looks of it, now Pete can't.
