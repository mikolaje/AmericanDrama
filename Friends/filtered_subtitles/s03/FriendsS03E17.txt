可以给我看漫画版吗012---Can I see the comics?
这是《纽约时报》012---This is the New York Times.
好  请问我可以看漫画版吗012---Okay, may I see the comics?
你们不是要带罗斯去看比赛吗012---I thought you were taking Ross to the game.
是啊  他会来这里跟我们碰头  不会吧  瑞秋跟我们也约在这里012---We are. He's meeting us here. No, Rachel's meeting us here.
别这样  他们可以  在同一个地方出现吧012---Come on. They can be in the same room.
你真该看看昨晚的情况  怎么了012---You should've been there last night. What happened?
罗斯到我们公寓012---Ross was hanging out at our place.
瑞秋过来跟钱德  借润肤霜…012---Rachel comes to borrow moisturizer from Chandler...
你不能就只是说  来借某样东西吗012---How hard is it to say "something"?
瑞秋过来借…某样东西012---Rachel came over to borrow "something."
反正呢  她跟罗斯就开始对骂012---Anyway, her and Ross just started yelling at each other.
为什么他会对她吼  是他跟别人上床012---Why was he yelling at her? He slept with someone else.
因为他说当时  两人是暂时分开的状态012---He says they were on a break when it happened...
所以她早该原谅他了012---...so she should've forgiven him by now.
他太不讲理了吧  天啊012---He is so unreasonable. God.
不过我想我懂他的意思012---Although I understand what he means.
天啊  这好像在看《六十分钟》012---Oh, my God. This is like 60 Minutes...
开始你很气制药公司012---...when at first you're mad at that pharmaceutical company...
制造药品012---...for making the drug.
然后你又为大众感到难过…012---And then, you just feel bad for the people because...
因为他们想要长出头发来012---...they needed to make their hair grow.
特别像我父母离婚的时候012---You know, this is like when my parents got divorced.
天啊  我希望罗斯不会  在童子军活动结束后绑架我012---I hope Ross doesn't try to kidnap me after Cub Scouts.
我梦到罗斯和瑞秋没有分手012---I dreamed that Ross and Rachel were still together.
大家都聚在一起  很开心012---And we were all hanging out and happy.
我做了同样的梦012---I had the same dream.
而且没人跟那个影印女孩上床  噢  我梦到的刚好相反012---And nobody slept with the Xerox girl. Oh, I had the opposite dream.
或许之后就会没事  已过一个礼拜了012---Maybe it's gonna be okay. I mean, it's been a week.
我从来不会花  超过一个礼拜的时间为爱伤神012---It never takes me more than a week to get over a relationship.
你洗个澡就不再为爱伤神了012---It never takes you more than a shower to get over a relationship.
好  我们走吧  去看今晚的精彩表演012---Let's go. Let's hit the road. Let's get the show on it.
让我先买杯咖啡012---Let me get coffee.
我知道一间很棒的咖啡厅  离这里很近012---I know the best coffeehouse. And it's close.
比这里还近012---Closer than here?
噢  你看  我找到咖啡了012---Oh, look. I found coffee.
快走吧012---Okay, let's skedaddle.
拜托  我才不喝  别人喝过的咖啡012---I'm not gonna drink somebody's old coffee.
是的  殿下012---Okay, Your Highness.
"瑞秋  我真的很抱歉" "没关系  罗斯  你想复合吗"012---"Rachel, I'm really sorry." "Okay, Ross. Wanna get back together?"
"好啊"012---"Yeah, okay."
有人听到了吗012---Did anyone else hear that?
《老友记》 第三季 第17集 滑雪旅行012---Friends S03E17  The One Without the Ski Trip
他在这里吗  不在012---Is he here?  No.
还给你的润肤霜012---Here's your moisturizer.
你们一定会爱死我的  听好了012---You guys are gonna love me. Okay, check it out.
我有五张星期四的票012---Thursday night, five tickets.
去看卡文克莱的内衣秀  你们都会跟我去012---Calvin Klein lingerie show, and you guys are coming with me.

有计划了  是跟罗斯012---...made plans with Ross.
嗯…好吧012---Oh. Well, okay.

他有个全新的  家庭剧院组合012---It's just, he got this new home-theater dealy...
他希望我们过去看看012---...and he wants us to check it out.
他很兴奋012---He's excited about it too.
甚至还把节目表  录在答录机上面012---He even recorded showtimes on his answering machine.
对不起  噢  没关系012---We're sorry, honey. Oh, it's okay.
瑞秋  真的不是我们不想去012---Rach, it's not that we don't want to. Really.
会有穿内衣的模特儿吗012---Are we talking models in their underwear?
跟高跟鞋012---And heels.
罗斯先问我们的  我们已经约好了012---Ross did ask us first, and we set that night aside.
没关系  是他先问的  这没什么012---Come on. If he asked you first, it's only fair.
天啊  我感觉好糟012---Oh, boy, do I feel bad.
非常糟012---Very bad.
钱德  你在干嘛012---Chandler, what are you doing? Chandler.
天啊012---Oh, my God.

其实我是昨天开始抽烟012---Well, actually, yesterday I was smoking again.
到今天还在抽012---Today I'm smoking, still.
嚼了那么多戒烟口香糖  怎么又开始抽012---Why would you start again after chewing all that quitting gum?
说真的  这跟我父母的离婚一样…012---This is just like my parents' divorce...
那也是我开始抽烟的时候012---...which is when I first started smoking.
你那时不是只有九岁吗012---Weren't you 9?
是啊012---Yeah.
午睡后的第一支烟真的是最过瘾…012---I'm telling you something, that first smoke after naptime...
太好了  我这么倒楣  一定是他012---That's great. With my luck, that's him.
他  罗斯吗012---Him? Ross?
不是  是赞美诗253篇 《爱的恩泽》012---No, "Hymn" 253: "His Eyes Are on the Sparrow."
父母离婚后  我开始用幽默来自卫012---When my parents got divorced, I started using humor as a defense mechanism.
嗨  你们这个周末有计划吗012---Hi. Uh, do you guys have weekend plans?
因为我妹说我们这个周末  可以去她的小屋  然后去滑雪012---Because my sister says we can spend the weekend at her cabin, skiing.
我先问了你们  对吧  我有遵守规则012---I'm asking you first, right? I'm playing by the rules.

钱德  你在抽烟  你在干嘛啊012---Chandler. You're smoking? What are you doing?
闭嘴  你又不是我的亲妈012---Shut up. You're not my real mom.
钱德  你可以把窗户关起来吗  我的奶头硬到可以切玻璃了012---Could you close that window? My nipples could cut glass.
真的吗  我的让我躲掉罚单012---Really? Because mine get me out of tickets.
真的很感激各位  花时间陪我012---Look, I just wanna say I really appreciate you spending time with me.
这段时间还真难熬  我只想说声谢谢012---It's been a hard time right now, so I just want to say thanks.

我们受邀去滑雪  去瑞秋妹妹的小屋012---We're, um, sort of invited to go skiing. You know, Rachel's sister's cabin?
要去整个周末012---So, for the whole weekend?
真的很抱歉  不过是她先问的012---We're really sorry, but she did ask us first.
没关系  我失恋的第一个周末…012---That's okay. If you all have to go away...
你们都要出城去…012---...for the first weekend I'm alone by myself...
我完全可以理解012---...then I totally understand.
我可以留下来   我留下来012---I can stay. I'm gonna stay.
上次去滑雪   我根本不敢跳下吊车012---The last time I went, I was afraid to leave the chair lift.

我们会玩得很开心的012---We're gonna have fun.
我们可以做牛奶软糖012---We can make fudge.
同情食物012---Pity food?
没关系  我不需要你们  任何人留下来012---You know what? I don't need any of you to stay.
没有人该留下来012---Nobody stays.
嗯   那么我也表示一下好了012---Well, then I might as well offer to stay.
嗨012---Hey...
有人替罗斯难过吗012---Does anybody else feel bad about Ross?
你觉得他还在生我们的气吗012---You think he's still mad?
他可能更生气了  因为你今天还跟他借雪镜012---He's probably more mad since you called him to borrow his goggles.
怎样  我的没有反光层啊012---What? Mine aren't tinted.
钱德012---Chandler.
干嘛012---What?
标志上写什么012---What does the sign say?

你不去吗  不用了  谢谢012---Aren't you gonna go? No, thanks.
瑞秋不上公共厕所的012---Rachel never pees in public restrooms.
他们老是没有卫生纸012---They never have any paper in there.
所以我的规则是  没有卫生纸  就不去厕所012---So my rule is, "No tissue, no tushy."
既然大家都要去…012---Well, if everybody's going...
不要关门  钥匙在里面012---Don't close it. The keys are in there.
噢   千万不要012---Oh, no, no, no, no.
怎么了  我的打火机在里面012---What's going on? My lighter's in there.

别担心  我可以打开  有人有衣架吗012---I can open this. Anybody got a coat hanger?
我有012---Oh, I do.
噢  不对  我今早穿衣服时  把衣架拿出来了012---No, I took it out of my shirt when I put it on this morning.
所以你父母亲  如果没有离婚的话012---So if your parents hadn't divorced...
你就能正常的回答问题了012---...you'd be able to answer a question like a normal person?
我需要铁丝类的东西把它撬开012---Look, I just need a wire something to jimmy it.
你们其中一个人  把胸罩的钢圈给我012---One of you give me your bra underwire.

快点  谁的胸部最大012---Come on. Who has the biggest boobs?
胸部最大  胸罩最大  钢圈也最长012---Whoever has the biggest boobs, has the biggest bra and wire.
才不要   胸罩很贵012---No. It's too expensive.
要回车里  就需要钢圈012---To get back in the car, we need that wire.
你们自己做决定012---Your call.
好吧  摩妮卡的最大012---Monica's are the biggest.
这两粒小红豆  拜托  瑞秋的最大012---These tiny little non-breasts? Please. It's gotta be Rachel.
不对  我的是骗人的012---No, mine are deceptively small.
我有时候会在胸罩上塞东西012---I mean, I actually sometimes stuff my bra.
对  但是你的胸罩  还是一样很大012---Well, then your bra would still be big.
不对  我是塞在胸罩外面012---No, I stuff outside the bra.
女士们  你们就让步吧012---Ladies, let's just compromise, okay?
菲比  瑞秋  把摩妮卡的胸罩脱掉012---Phoebe, Rachel, take off Monica's bra.

用我的  谢谢012---You can have mine.Thank you.

我想引来印地安人  这样就有救了012---I thought if I littered, that crying Indian might come by and save us.
好了012---There.
谢了  菲比  你真大方012---Thank you, Phoebe. That's very, very generous.
现在来讨论  谁的屁股最正012---Now, let's decide who has the nicest ass.

怎么了  怎么了012---What's going on? What?
这以前有发生过012---Yeah, this has happened before.
所以你知道该怎么办  对  多加点油012---So you know how to fix it? Yep. Put more gas in.
嗨  你怎么会来了012---Hi. What are you doing here?
我只是在想… 我们分开的时候012---I was wondering, when you and I split up...
你是不是拿了  录了《风流医生俏护士》的最后一集012---...did you get the tape that was half the last episode of M.A.S. H...
跟人质回国新闻的那卷带子012---...and half the hostages coming home?

对不起  每次来的时候  我都在后座睡觉012---I always slept in the back when we drove here.
你可以派人到76号公路  检查所有休息站吗012---Can you just send someone up and down 76 and check every rest stop?
93号也是012---And also 93?
好  不行  他们不肯012---Okay. No, they don't do that.
会有人来救我们的012---Somebody will come and save us.
谁啊  过去一个半小时  你有看到车子吗012---Who? Have you seen a car in the last hour and a half?

我很不安012---It's very unsettling.
对吧  真是太扯了012---Right? I mean, it's pretty unbelievable.
他们就这样走了  头也不回的走012---They just took off without even looking back.
我才不需要他们  我有你们做我的朋友012---I don't need them. I've got you guys now as friends.
你和苏珊012---You and Susan.
苏珊会很开心的012---Susan will be so pleased.

瑞秋  这里的棉条  只要一毛钱012---Hey, Rach. The tampons here are only a penny.
我们买回去囤积012---Let's stock up.
我们没油了  又不知道方位  没办法叫拖车012---We're out of gas and don't know where we are, so we can't get a tow truck.
现在需要帮忙啦  是的  拜托012---Oh. Now you want a favor? Yes, please.
很遗憾你的车子不能动了…012---I'm sorry your car broke down, Pheebs...

开我的车去接他们012---Take my car. Get your friends.
不  我才不要012---No, I won't pick them up.
我们都知道你会去的  因为你不是混蛋012---We both know you'll do it because you're not a jerk.
你顶多再骂半小时  还是会去接他们…012---So you can sulk here for half an hour, then go get them...
不如一边开车一边骂  不要  瑞秋…012---...or save time and sulk in the car. Rachel doesn't...
我很遗憾瑞秋为了马克甩掉你…012---I'm sorry Rachel dumped you for Mark...
你是无辜的受害者012---...and you're the innocent victim in this.
但不能因为这样  就迁怒你的朋友012---But don't punish your friends for what Rachel did.
你说得没错012---Yeah, you're right.
菲比  等等  罗斯有话要说012---Phoebe, hang on. Ross wants to say something.

你跟其他女人上床012---You slept with another woman?
你还有资格说啊012---Oh, you're one to talk.
好了012---Okay, done.
什么是"命救"012---What's "pleh"?
就是 "救命" 反过来写…012---That's "help" spelled backwards...
这样直升机在天空飞的时候  才看得懂012---...so that the helicopters can read it from the air.
蠢人反过来写是什么012---Ha. What's "dufus" spelled backwards?
有车了012---Car. Car.
噢   罗斯出来兜风了012---Oh, it's Ross on one of his drives.
他来这里干什么012---What is he doing here?
他是来救你们大家一命的012---He is saving your butt.
除非我惹到某人…012---Unless I'm stepping on some toes here...

各位…012---You guys...
罗斯怎么办  他大老远开来这里012---...what do we do about Ross? He drove all the way up here.
叫他回去  我们留在这里滑雪吗012---Just send him back, then we'll go skiing?
真是烦死了012---This is horrible. It's just horrible.
嘿  我们是不是应该  叫罗斯一起来012---Should we ask Ross to come along?
但是瑞秋怎么办  要怎么问她012---But what about Rachel? How are we gonna even ask her?
问我什么012---Ask me what?
可以让罗斯留下来滑雪吗012---If, uh, it might be okay if Ross came skiing?
我没有要问啊012---No, I wasn't gonna ask that.
你们实在太扯了  不行  他不能去012---You guys are unbelievable. No, he cannot come.
什么  烦死了012---Excuse me? It's horrible.
拜托  我不能去你的神奇小屋吗012---Oh, please? Can't I come to your special, magical cabin?
你去干什么  你滑雪糟透了012---Why would you even want to come? You're a horrible skier.
真是说到我的痛处啊  滑雪技巧012---Oh. Hitting me where it hurts. My ski skills.
又来了012---Here we go again.
我受不了了012---I can't handle this, you guys.
我可以  我的绰号是"受得了"012---I can handle it. "Handle" is my middle name.
