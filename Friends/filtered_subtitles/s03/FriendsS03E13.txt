嘿012---Hey.
总共六块钱012---Six dollars, please.
六块  我只租了一晚  应该是三块012---Six? I just had it for one night. It's 3.
是到八点  现在已经八点零二分了012---Eight o'clock is the cutoff. And, oh, it's 8:02.
我觉得你有太多权力了012---You know, in a weird way, you have too much power.
你得帮帮我  因为我只有三块012---Look, you're gonna have to help me out here because I only have 3.
我可以帮你012---I can help with that.
天啊  理查012---Oh, my God. Richard?
你好  你好012---Hi.  Hi.
你的胡须剃掉了012---Wow. Your lip went bald.
谢了012---Thanks.
你看起来很棒012---So you look great.
是啊012---Yeah, right. Ha, ha.
是真的…012---No, you do. You...
你… 怎样012---You just... You... What?
你有条内裤粘在腿上012---You got panties stuck to your leg.
因为我刚刚从干衣机收衣服012---Ahem, that's because I was just grabbing some things out of the dryer...
静电的关系012---...and static cling. Ha, ha.
不然就是上帝知道  我会撞见你012---Or maybe it's just because God knew I'd be running into you...
看到这个大好机会012---...and saw an opportunity.
很高兴看到你012---It's good to see you.
我也很高兴看到你012---It's good to see you too.
《老友记》 第三季  第13集  摩妮卡和理查只是朋友012---Friends S03E13  The One Where Monica and Richard are Just Friends
有看到那个家伙吗  他在经典区… 谁012---See that guy? He's in "Classics" now... Who?
但我们一离开  他就会去A片区012---...but you know as soon as we leave, he's going straight to the porn.
他会租《大国民》…012---He's gonna go up to the counter with Citizen Kane...
《迷魂记》和《发条橘子》012---...Vertigo and Clockwork Orgy. Ha, ha.
太棒了012---This is nice.
对   我怀念这个012---Ha, ha. Yeah. I miss this.
我也是012---Me too.
你想去吃点汉堡吗012---So you wanna get a hamburger or something?
我不知道这样好不好012---Aw, um, I don't know if that's a good idea.
只是朋友   我保证不会偷摸你012---No. Just friends. I won't grope you. I promise.
我觉得太快了012---Yeah, I think it's too soon.
不会太快  我十一点吃的午餐012---No, it's not too soon. I had lunch at 11.
好啊   宝贝012---Yeah, baby.
你在干嘛  做巧克力牛奶  要来一点吗012---What are you doing? Making chocolate milk. You want some?
不用  我已经二十九岁了012---No, thanks. I'm 29.
天啊  我得去上班了012---Oh, my God. I gotta go to work.
你今天会几点下班012---What time do you think you're gonna get off tonight?
我不知道  可能会很晚012---I don't know, honey. It could be really late.
不会吧  又来了012---Oh, come on. Not again.
我知道  对不起  我跟你打个商量  好吗012---Oh, I know. I'm sorry. Listen, I'll make a deal with you, okay?
只要我下班回家…012---Mm. Every night that you're asleep...
而你已经睡了… 嗯012---...before I get home from work... Yeah.
我会用过去很受欢迎的方法  叫你起床012---...I will wake you up in a way that has proved very popular in the past.
如果你得晚下班  我一定会支持你012---Well, now, if you need to stay late, I want to be supportive of that.
谢谢012---Thank you.
嗨   嘿  菲比012---Hi. Hey, Pheebs.
嗨   嘿012---Hi. Hey.
看看你  你什么时候  开始溜直排轮了012---Look at you. Since when do you Rollerblade?
明天开始012---Oh. Since tomorrow.
我在公园  遇见一个很可爱的家伙012---I met this really cute guy in the park.
他喜欢慢跑  溜直排轮和游泳  所以我们交换条件012---And he, like, you know, jogs and blades and swims, and so we made a deal.
他会教我做些运动012---He's gonna teach me how to do all sorts ofjock stuff.
那你会替他做什么  我会让他教012---And what are you gonna do for him? I'm gonna let him.
好吧 很好012---Okay. Cool.
早安  嘿012---Morning. Hey.
有人昨晚很晚回来喔012---Somebody got in late last night. Ahem.
嗯  我撞见理查012---Yeah, well, I ran into Richard.
什么时候的事  大约八点零二分012---When did this happen? Oh, um, around 8:02.
我们聊了一会…012---And we, uh, talked for a little while...
然后去吃纯友谊汉堡012---...and then, um, we went out for an innocent burger.
噢  没有什么  所谓的纯友谊汉堡012---Oh, there's no such thing as an innocent burger.
你会再见他吗  明天晚上012---Are you gonna see him again? Tomorrow night.
摩妮卡  你在干嘛012---Monica, what are you doing?
她花了六个月的时间  忘记他…012---Well, she spent the last six months getting over him...
现在用跟他约会  来庆祝012---...and now she's celebrating that by going on a date with him.
这不是约会  好吗012---It's not a date, okay?
我只是教他做  带到朋友家派对的千层面012---I'm just gonna teach him how to make a lasagna for some potluck dinner he has.
你可能会想要多做一点  因为…012---Well, you might want to make a little extra because, you know...
做完爱之后  可能会肚子饿012---...you'll probably be hungry after the sex. Mm.
我们不会做爱的012---We're not gonna have sex.
懂吗  情况没有改变012---Okay? Nothing's changed here.
他还是不想要小孩  而我想要012---He still doesn't want children, and I still do.
所以我们会当朋友012---So that's why we're gonna just be friends.
脱衣服的朋友012---Naked friends.
嘿  你有冰块吗  嘿012---Hey. Do you have any ice? Hey.
看冷冻库有没有012---Check the freezer.
如果里面没有  大概是用完了012---If there's none in there, we're probably out.
你才刚下班吗  很晚了012---Are you just getting home from work? It's late.
是啊  但我今天过得很棒012---Yeah, I know. I had the greatest day, though.
我今天跟卡文克莱的业务代表开会012---I got to sit in on a meeting with the reps from Calvin Klein.
我跟我老板说我喜欢睡衣系列  她就订了一堆012---I told my boss I liked this line of lingerie, she ordered a ton of it.
你今天过得怎样012---How was your day?
我发现我可以只用舌头  数出我有多少牙齿012---I discovered I'm able to count all my teeth using just my tongue.
为什么你的冷冻库有《鬼店》012---Why do you have a copy of The Shining in your freezer?
我昨天晚上看到很害怕  所以…012---Oh. I was reading it last night and I got scared, so...
放在冷冻库  你就很安全吗012---But, uh, you're safe from it if it's in the freezer?
至少安全一点012---Well, safer.
我会先确定冷冻库有位置012---I never start reading The Shining...
才会开始读《鬼店》012---...without making sure we got plenty of room in the freezer.
你多久读一次012---How often do you read it?
你难道不会重覆读某本书吗012---Haven't you ever read the same book over and over again?
嗯   我《小妇人》读过  不只一次012---Well, um, I guess I read Little Women more than once.
但那是经典名著   《鬼店》有什么好看的012---But that's a classic. What's so great about The Shining?
问题应该是  《鬼店》有什么不好看的012---The question should be, Rach, "What is not so great about The Shining?"
懂吗  答案就是 "太好看了"012---Okay? And the answer would be, "Nothing." All right?
这可是最恐怖的书012---This is, like, the scariest book ever.
我敢说一定比你的经典名著好看012---I bet it's way better than that classic of yours.
好012---Ha, ha. Okay.
再看看吧012---Uh, well, we'll just see about that, okay?
我会读《鬼店》   你来读《小妇人》012---I will read The Shining, and you will read Little Women.
好  没问题  好吧012---All right, you got it. All right?
好  好012---Okay. Okay.
瑞秋  这些小妇人  嗯012---Uh, now, Rach, these little women... Yeah.
她们有多小012---How little are they?
小得很恐怖吗012---I mean, are they, like, scary little?
钱德  罗斯  这位是罗伯  噢  你好012---Um, Chandler, Ross? This is Robert. Oh, hey.
嗨  你这里有口红印012---Hi. You have lipstick right here.
没关系  是我的  我们刚刚接吻012---Oh. Huh. That's okay, it's mine. We just kissed.
穿短裤不会太冷吗012---So isn't it a bit cold out for shorts?
嗯   我是加州来的012---Well, I'm from California.
对啊  你们有时候  会突然起火012---Right, right. Sometimes you guys just burst into flame.
我起来了  我站起来了012---I'm up. Ahem. I'm up. I've gotten up now.
有人要点什么吗012---Anybody, uh, want anything?
我要咖啡   我也是012---I'll have coffee. Yeah, me too.
总共三杯   好  罗斯  你跟我来吧012---Yeah, make that three. Okay. Ross, why don't you come with me?
好012---Okay. Ha, ha.
你是怎么了  发生什么事012---What is the matter with you? What's going on?
罗伯跑出来了012---Robert's coming out.
什么意思  他是同志012---What do you mean? What, is he gay?
不是  他…012---No, he...
他从短裤跑出来了012---He's coming out of his shorts.
什么012---What?
他的"脑袋"跑出来了012---The man is showing brain.
你确定吗   等等012---Are you sure? Hold on.
抱歉   刚刚是要咖啡和…012---Ahem. I'm sorry, you guys. That was a coffee and a...
咖啡  我们可以写下来  好012---Coffee. We could write it down. Okay.
不  不用了  不需要012---No, no. That won't be, uh... Won't be necessary.
怎样  没错…012---Well? Yeah, yeah, yeah.
该怎么办…012---What do we do? What do we do?
嗯  我想就不要直接看着那里012---Well, I suppose we just try to not look directly at it.
像日蚀一样012---Like an eclipse.
如果今晚有人赞美我的厨艺  我要说什么012---When people compliment me on my cooking tonight, what do I say?
你就谢谢他们  然后买礼物送我012---Well, you say, "Thank you very much." And then you buy me something pretty.
好了  我们要把手放到碗里…012---Come on, we're gonna put our hands in this bowl...
然后压扁蕃茄012---...and we're gonna start squishing the tomatoes.
感觉好奇怪012---Ooh, this feels very weird.
你每天都在摸眼球  这还会奇怪012---Heh. You touch people's eyeballs every day and this feels weird?
我是摸眼球012---Yeah, well, sure, I touch them.
但我也花了好几年的时间  不去压扁它们012---But I spent years learning not to squish them.
那是我的手012---That's my hand.
好   继续压吧012---Okay. Gotta keep squishing.
蕃茄被压扁了012---The tomatoes are squishing.
噢012---Oh, yeah. Oh. Oh.
天啊  你的衣服沾到了012---Oh, gosh. You got some on your shirt.
对   等等012---Yeah. Hold on a second.
倒点苏打水  马上擦一擦012---Okay, just put a little club soda on it. Get to it right away.
应该…012---It should, um, do...
有用012---...the trick.
怎么了012---What?
你的裤子上面也有012---Um, you've got some on your pants.
我会把裤子丢了012---I'll just throw them out.
这些小妇人真的…012---These little women.
你喜欢  对吧012---You're liking it, huh?
是啊   艾咪刚刚把乔的手稿烧掉了012---Oh, yeah. Amy just burned Jo's manuscript.
这样的男人一定不会原谅她的012---I don't see how he could ever forgive her.
乔是女生  是乔瑟芬的简称012---Um, Jo's a girl. It's short for Josephine.
但是乔喜欢罗瑞012---But Jo's got a crush on Laurie.
所以是女女关系罗012---You mean it's like a girl-girl thing?
因为《鬼店》就是没有  这种情节012---Because that is the one thing missing from The Shining.
不   罗瑞是男的012---No, actually, Laurie's a boy.
难怪瑞秋得读这么多遍才会懂012---No wonder Rachel had to read this so many times.
嘿   嘿012---Hey. Hey.
篮球好玩吗012---Hey, how'd the, uh, basketball go?
噢   我学会带球上篮  罚球和二十三分球012---Oh, okay. I learned how to shoot a lay-up, a foul shot, and a 23-pointer.
你是说三分球吗012---You mean a 3-pointer?
噢   我得分比较多  因为我很俏丽012---Oh, I get more because I'm dainty.
这里有没有电话   我得查看留言012---So, um, is there a phone here I can check my messages?
在后面  你要零钱吗  不用了  我袜子里都会放一点012---Yeah, in the back. Do you want a quarter? Oh, no. I always carry one in my sock.
你在干嘛  回到你自己那边…012---What are you doing? Get back over on your side of the...
哇啊012---Hello.
你好  我是乔伊  我们还没见过  嗨012---Hi. I'm Joey. We haven't met. Hi.
很高兴认识你   我是罗伯   好012---Uh, good to meet you. Robert. Okay.
怎么了012---What?
干嘛  怎么了012---What? You guys, what is going on?
你们不喜欢罗伯吗012---Do you not like Robert?
你们为什么一直在笑012---Why are you laughing?
冷静点   没必要一直想鸡蛋012---Calm down. No reason to get testy.
别这样  抱歉012---You guys. Come on. We're sorry.
只是罗伯好像  在短裤方面…012---It just seems that Robert isn't as concealed in the shorts area...
遮得不够好012---...as, uh, one may have hoped.
什么意思012---How do you mean?
嘿   嘿012---Hey. Hey.
罗伯  你可以把那些饼干  传给我吗012---Uh, Robert? Could you, uh, pass me those cookies?
当然可以012---Sure.
千层面的反应如何012---So how'd the lasagna go over?
真的吗  很好  所以你欠我三样礼物012---Really? Good. So you owe me three pretty things.
对   我也一直在想你012---Yeah. I've been thinking about you too.
不会吧  这种柏拉图恋情很不容易012---Well, no. It's hard, this platonomy thing.
什么…  有这个字啊012---What...? It's a word.
对   我真的觉得这样比较好  对  这样很聪明012---Yeah. I do think it's better this way. Yeah, we're being smart.
我很确定012---Yes, I'm sure.
你真的确定012---You really sure?
我再打回给你012---I'll call you back.
我们可以当一起上床的朋友012---So we can be friends who sleep together.
绝对可以  我们就是这样012---Absolutely. This'll just be something we do.
像打壁球一样012---Like racquetball.
对  听起来聪明又健康012---Yeah. Sounds smart and healthy to me.
我只是好奇问问…012---So, um, just out of, uh, curiosity...
你目前有其他一起打壁球的伙伴吗012---...um, do you currently have any other racquetball buddies?
只有你爸012---Just your dad.
不过是打真的壁球012---Although that's actually racquetball.
不过我有个相亲…012---You know, I do have a blind date...
下星期二   跟我妹的邻居012---...with my sister's neighbor next Tuesday.
你要我取消吗012---Do you want me to cancel it?
不用012---No.
不要  好012---No.  Yeah.
因为如果你这么做  就代表是为了我取消012---Because if you did, that means you'd be canceling for me.
而我们只是朋友  没错012---And we're just friends. Exactly.
嘿012---Hey.
嘿   噢   不要坐下012---Hey. Oh, don't sit down.
准备去打击练习场了吗  没错012---Ready to go to the batting cage? You bet.
首先  有个礼物要送你012---And first, here's a gift. Ha, ha.
哇 啊012---Oh, wow.
嘿   伸缩内裤012---Hey. Stretchy pants?
最棒的发明之一012---Well, those are the greatest things in the world.
如果我是你  一定每天都穿012---If I were you, I'd wear them every day, every day.
天啊  谢谢  你真的很贴心012---Jeez, thank you. Really, that's so nice.
但是老实说  我不认为自己会穿012---But, um, to be honest, I don't think I can wear these.
太紧了  让我觉得大家都看得到012---They're so tight. I'd feel like I'm on display.
对不起012---I'm sorry.
没关系  我可以…012---That's all right. I'll figure...
嘿   你好吗012---Hey. How you doing?
好吗   好啊012---How's it going? Good.
很好  嘿   瑞秋012---Good. Hey, Rach?
《鬼店》看得如何了  丹尼刚进去217号房012---How you doing with The Shining? Uh, Danny just went into Room 217.
接下来是最棒的部分  浴缸里死去的女人…012---Ooh. The next part's the best. When that dead lady in the bathtub...
不要说   别这样  你不要说012---No, no, no. Come on. You're gonna ruin it.
好  我用暗号说012---All right, I'll talk in code.
记得那个孩子在走廊  看到两个东西的时候吗012---Remember when the kid sees those two blanks in the hallway?
记得  很酷  对012---Yeah, that's very cool. Yeah.
所有东西和没东西  让东西变东西  对吧012---Ooh. All blank and no blank makes blank a blank-blank, right?
噢  不  还有最后012---Oh, no, no. No, the end.
杰克差点用那东西  杀掉所有人012---When Jack almost kills them all with that blank...
但在最后关头  他们逃掉了012---...but then in the last second they get away. Aw.
乔伊  我不敢相信  你竟然这么做012---Joey, I can't believe you just did that.
我不敢相信  她解读了你的暗号012---I can't believe she cracked your code.
好吧  罗瑞跟乔求婚  但是她拒绝…012---All right, okay. Laurie proposes to Jo and she says no...
虽然她还很爱他  最后他娶了艾咪012---...even though she's still in love with him. And then he ends up marrying Amy.
嘿012---Hey.
我的是个意外012---Mine was by accident.
好吧012---All right.
锅炉爆炸  毁掉饭店  杀死父亲012---The boiler explodes and destroys the hotel and kills the dad.
贝丝会死掉012---Beth dies.
贝丝… 贝丝会死掉012---Beth...? Beth dies?
是真的吗  如果我读下去  贝丝会死掉012---Is that true? If I keep reading, is Beth gonna die?
不  贝丝不会死  她不会死  对吧  瑞秋012---No, Beth doesn't die. She doesn't die. Does she, Rachel?
什么  乔伊在问你是不是毁了…012---What? Joey's asking if you've just ruined...
不是由杰克尼克逊主演  他喜爱的第一本小说012---...the first book he's ever loved that didn't star Jack Nicholson.
不  她不会死012---No. She doesn't die.
那你为什么要那么说012---Then why would you say that?
因为我想伤害你012---Because I wanted to hurt you.
噢  在这里  我的钥匙掉了012---Oh, there they are. I dropped my keys.
找到了012---Got them.
嗨012---Hi.
对不起…012---Sorry. I'm sorry.
我今天过得很不好012---You would not believe my day.
我值了两班  最糟的是…012---I had to work two shifts. And then to top it off...
我在烤东西时  连一边的假胸部都烤掉了012---...I lost one of my fake boobs in a grill fire.
你在笑什么012---What are you smiling at?
抱歉   我只是在想  你今天还可以更好012---Sorry, I was just thinking your day could still pick up.
你好012---Hello.
我超爱这种朋友关系的012---I love this friend thing.
听好  罗伯很快就会到了…012---Listen, Robert's gonna be here any second...
你们其中一人  可以跟他说吗012---...so could one of you just tell him?
拜托  现在就得说012---Oh. Please, right now.
我每次看到他都会担心  "是不是又松了  在盯着我看吗"012---No, every time I see him, it's like, "Is it on the loose? Is it watching me?"
我们不能跟他说012---We can't tell him.
不可以随便跟不太熟的人  聊他的…012---You can't go up to a guy you barely know and talk about his...
宝贝012---...stuff.
没错   即使是赞美也一样012---He's right. Even if it's to say something complimentary.
嘿   嘿012---Hey. Hey.
准备去健身房了吗012---So you ready for the gym?
里面有新的攀岩墙  我们可以互相联结012---They've got this new rock-climbing wall. We can spot each other.
我在这里就可以联结你了012---Yeah, I can spot you from here.
什么012---What?
好  听好了  罗伯…012---Okay. Listen, ahem, Robert...
嘿  我们不是要…  对  我们得去…012---Hey, don't we have to? Yeah, we got... Yeah. Mm-hm.
我觉得你人  真的很好012---I think you're really, really great.
天啊  又来了012---Oh, God. Here we go again.
为什么这一直发生在我身上   是因为我表现出什么吗012---Why does this keep happening to me? Is it something I'm putting out there?
是我的错吗  还是我有病012---Is this my fault? Or am I just nuts?
我不知道该说什么012---I don't know what to say.
老兄   这里是老少咸宜的咖啡厅  把老鼠关回去012---Hey, buddy? This is a family place. Put the mouse back in the house.
真的吗   就像其他人的公寓一样012---Really? Well, it's just like everyone else's apartment.
有房间  有墙和天花板012---It's got, uh, rooms and walls and ceilings.
我只想看看你住的地方  带我看看吧012---I just wanted to see where you live. Now give me the tour.
天啊…012---Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
这里是客厅   很棒012---Uh, this is the living room. That's nice.
好012---All right.
厨房在这里  很漂亮012---And this is the kitchen.That's real pretty.
等等  我不能看卧室吗012---Wait a minute. Don't I get to see the bedroom?
卧室   喔   就是很普通的…012---RICHARD: The bedroom. Well, it's pretty much your typical...

你似乎是不介意012---Well, you seem fine.
好吧   我非常介意012---Okay, you know what? I'm not fine. I'm not.
