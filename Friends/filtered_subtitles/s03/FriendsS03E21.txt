我买了一家餐厅  想雇用你当主厨012---I bought a restaurant, and I would like you to be the chef.
什么012---What? Oh.
你能相信他为我买了一家餐厅吗012---Can you believe he just offered me a restaurant?
真是个混蛋   你要我踢他屁股吗012---What a jerk. You want me to kick his ass?
这一直是我的梦想  自从我买了第一个快速烤箱012---I mean, this has been my dream since I got my first Easy-Bake Oven...
开了第一家快速摩妮卡面包店后012---...and opened Easy-Monica's Bakery.
我是说  我能胜任这份工作  难不了我012---I mean, I would kill for this job. I mean, I can totally do this job...
天知道我已经受够了012---...and God knows I've paid my dues. Ugh.
但彼特会这么做是因为他喜欢我012---But Pete's just doing this because he has a crush on me.
你还是对他没感觉  没错012---And you're still not attracted to him at all? Mm. No.
我怎么能接受他送我餐厅  我没办法012---I mean, how could I accept a restaurant from him? I can't.
我念七年级时  就没办法收下史都文森送我的项链012---I couldn't even accept a necklace from Stu Vincent in the seventh grade.

你猜怎么了  你不再是我的女朋友了012---Guess what. You're not my girlfriend anymore, so...
我懂了  你用这套西装发表宣言012---Oh, I see. So this suit is making a point.Mm.
你现在孤家寡人 可以尽情的出丑012---Now that you're on your own, you're free to look as stupid as you'd like.
你很喜欢  对吧012---You like it, right?
当然  我觉得你穿上它  比肯德基爷爷帅多了012---Absolutely. I like it even more on you than I did on Colonel Sanders.
罗斯  我是开玩笑的  快回来012---Huh. Ross, Ross, I'm kidding. Come here.
你要跟我们说什么  你怎么发明轧棉机的012---What were you gonna tell us? Was it how you invented the cotton gin?

你们了解鸡吗012---Whoa, whoa, whoa. You guys, do you know anything about chicks?
了解鸡  不012---Fowl? No.
了解女人  不012---Women? No.
好吧  这是一份重责大任012---Okay, well, they are a huge responsibility.
特别是在这个年龄   他们随时都需要照顾012---Especially at this age. They require constant care.
它们不能吃错东西   需要很多的关爱012---They need just the right food and lots and lots of love.
没问题012---Oh, well, no problem there.
别激动  兄弟012---Easy, Lenny.
我想问你考虑过了吗012---So, I mean, have you thought about it?
好吧  问题是这样的012---Okay, here's the thing.
不  别那么说  我讨厌你那么说012---Oh, no. Not "the thing." I hate "the thing."
有什么问题呢012---What's "the thing"?
我没办法那么做012---I can't do it.
对不起  我真的很想答应012---I'm sorry. I wish I could...
听着  你暗恋我012---...but, um, see, you have these feelings for me.
等一下  你在担心那个012---Wait, wait, wait. That's what you're worried about?
如果那是问题  我们之间没有问题012---If that's the problem, we've got no problem.
不  我打算在吃晚餐时告诉你  出差时我认识一个女孩012---Huh? No.I was gonna tell you this over dinner, but I met somebody else, on my trip.
她叫做安  她是个记者  我们在飞机上认识012---Her name's Ann. She's a journalist. Uh, we met on the plane.
她问我可不可以吃掉我的花生012---She asked me if she could finish off my peanuts.
我以为她是指别的东西  我们哈哈大笑012---I thought she said something else. We had a big laugh.
我只是厌倦了等待012---Yeah, I just... I mean, I got tired of waiting.
真的很棒  我是说对不起  但我为你感到高兴012---Oh, that's great. I mean, I'm sorry, but I'm so happy for you.
现在我能为你工作了  我想是的012---And now I can work for you. I guess you can.
天啊  这太不可思议了012---Oh, my God. Oh, this is incredible. Oh.

什么012---What?
我是说这个女人  是你编出来的  对吧012---I'm just saying, this woman, I mean, she's fictitious, no?
为什么你要那么说  因为你还是喜欢摩妮卡012---Why would you say that? You're still into Monica.
所以你跟她说你有了别人  她会答应跟你合作012---So you told her there's somebody else so she'd agree to work with you.
相处久了  也许就会产生感情012---Because you figure, if you spend time together, maybe something might happen.
你很厉害   你很厉害012---You're good. You're good.
对  不  我的直觉很准  还有通灵能力012---Yeah. No, I'm fairly intuitive. And psychic.

这样不行喔  先生012---Well, I don't think so, mister.
我需要放松  好吗  我工作了一整天012---Hey. I need to relax, okay? I was working all day.
照顾小鸡就不忙吗012---And you don't think taking care of our chick is work?
我不是那个意思  好吧  我是说…012---That's not what I said. Okay, I just meant...
我了解你的意思012---I know what you meant.
