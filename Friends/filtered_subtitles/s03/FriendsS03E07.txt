我学到在肥皂剧中012---...uh, ahem, I learned that one of the most important things...
最重要的一件事就是反应012---...in soap opera acting is reacting.
不代表再演一次012---This does not mean acting again.
这代表你没有台词  而是别人刚讲完012---It means you don't have a line, but someone else just did.
就像这样012---And it goes something like this. Ahem.
谢了…012---Thanks. Thanks. Thanks a lot.

那么…012---So.
图书馆怎么样  是博物馆012---How's the library? Uh, museum.
图书馆怎么了  从来都没有过图书馆012---What happened to the library?  There never was a library.
我是说  到处都有图书馆012---I mean, there are libraries. It's just that I, um...
但我没在任何一间工作过012---I've never worked at one. Ha, ha.
你们知道这里什么好吃吗012---You know what's really good here?
龙虾012---The lobster. Mm.
你觉得怎样  直接点三只  好啊  如果你很饿的话012---What do you say? Shall I just order three? Yeah, if you're really hungry. Ha, ha.
那是笑话  我在开玩笑012---It was a joke. I made a joke.
其实  罗斯对龙虾过敏012---Yeah, actually, Daddy, Ross is allergic to lobster.
什么人会对龙虾过敏012---What kind of person's allergic to lobster?
大概是在图书馆工作的人吧012---I guess the kind of person that works in a library. Ha, ha.
不是… 我知道  是博物馆012---It's not...  I know. It's a museum.
只有你可以开玩笑吗  至少我的比较好笑  服务生012---What, you're the only who can make a joke? At least mine was funny. Uh, waiter.
我们要两只龙虾  和一份菜单012---We will have two lobsters and a menu.
葛林医生  那艘旧船怎么样了012---So, Dr. Green, how's the old boat?
他们发现有铁锈012---They found rust.
你知道锈会让船怎样吗  有怀旧风012---Do you know what rust does to a boat?  Gives it a nice antique-y look?
铁锈等同于船癌  罗斯012---Rust is boat cancer, Ross.
哇  真遗憾012---Wow, I'm sorry.
我小时候就这样  失去了一台脚踏车012---When I was a kid, I lost a bike to that. Ha, ha.
失陪一下012---Excuse me for a moment, will you, please?
我们走之前  我想跟莱文他们说再见012---I wanna say good night to the Levines before we go.
好012---Okay.
亲爱的  别这样  没那么糟糕012---Honey, stop. It's not that bad.
是啊012---Yeah. Oh.
我想你爸算错了012---Uh-oh. I think your dad must have added wrong.
他只给了百分之四的小费012---He only tipped, like, 4 percent.
对  他就是这样012---Yeah. Ahem, that's Daddy.
"他就是这样"  这不会困扰你吗  你也是服务生012---"That's Daddy"? Doesn't it bother you? You're a waitress.
的确会  罗斯012---Yes, it bothers me, Ross.
但如果他是咖啡厅的常客…012---But, you know, if he was a regular at the coffee house...
我会在饮料里加胡椒012---...I'd be serving him sneezers.
那又怎样  罗斯…012---So?  So, Ross...
我跟他抱怨几百次了  他就是不改012---...I've bugged him about this a million times. He's not gonna change.
你真的在饮料里加胡椒012---Do you really serve people sneezers?
嗯  我是不会012---Ahem, well, um, I don't.
好了  准备走了吗  好了012---All right, kids. Ready? Yes.
再次谢谢你  葛林医生012---Thanks again, Dr. Green. Uh-huh.
等等  我忘了拿帐单012---Wait, wait, wait, I think I forgot my receipt.
噢  你不需要的  为什么012---Oh, you don't need that. - Ahem, why not?
复写纸很脏会沾到手指  引发…012---The carbon. It's messy. I mean, gets on your fingers and causes...
夜盲症012---...the, uh, night blindness.
这是什么012---What is this?
谁放的二十元012---Who put a 20 down here?
噢  是我012---Huh? Oh, yeah, that would be me.
我…我有个问题012---Um, I have... I have a problem.
我小费给太多了  太多了012---I tip way too much, way, way too much.
到了病态的地步  没错012---It's a sickness, really. Yeah, it is. It is.
我们得想点办法  抱歉012---We have to do something about that. Excuse me.
你觉得我很小气012---You think I'm cheap?
爸  他没有这个意思012---He didn't mean anything by that. - Huh?
真的没有  我做的事都没什么意思012---He really didn't. Nothing I do means anything. Really.
太棒了  晚餐我付了两百块012---This is nice. I pay $200 for dinner.
你只放了20元  就一副大爷的样子012---You put down 20 and you come out looking like Mr. Big-Shot.
你真的想当大爷吗  不012---You really wanna be Mr. Big-Shot? Oh.
这样吧  帐单由你来付  大爷012---Here. I'll tell you what. You pay the whole bill, Mr. Big-Shot. All right?
至少"大爷" 比"油头"好多了012---Well, "Mr. Big-Shot" is better than "Wet-Head."
来点演戏的小诀窍012---Okay, some tricks of the trade.
我演戏时都哭不出来012---Now, I've never been able to cry as an actor...
如果我得演哭戏…012---...so if I'm in a scene where I have to cry...
我会在口袋剪个洞012---...I cut a hole in my pocket...
放个钳子在里面012---...take a pair of tweezers...
然后开始拔毛012---...and just start pulling.
好… 假如我要表现…012---Okay. Or uh... Or let's say I want to convey...
刚做了坏事的感觉012---...that I've, uh, just done something evil.
就得做出"我的眉毛  有个鱼钩"的表情012---Well, that would be your basic I've-got-a fish-hook-in-my-eyebrow-and-I-like-it.
好吗  假如我刚刚听到坏消息012---No? Okay. Let's say I've just gotten bad news.
我就会试着心算232除以13012---Well, all I do there is try and divide 232 by 13.
就是这样012---And that's how it's done.
今晚的肥皂剧演出到此结束012---Great soap opera acting tonight, everybody.

你一定要放钱就对了  不放不行012---Had to do it, didn't you? You couldn't leave it alone.
百分之四  就算食物里面有虫  我给的小费都比这个多012---Four percent, okay? I tip more than that when there's a bug in my food.
罗斯  今晚只是  要让你们两个处得来012---Ross, tonight was about the two of you getting along.

菲比  你在干嘛012---Hey, Pheebs. What are you doing?
我整个人都慌了012---I'm... I'm freaking out.
摩妮卡交待我做一件事  她不该这么做的012---Monica kind of trusted me with something and she shouldn't have.
我很久不住在这里了  所以我得问你012---All right, I haven't lived here in a while, so I have to ask you.
摩妮卡睡觉时还是会开灯吗012---Does Monica still turn the lights on in her bedroom?
会  我完蛋了012---Ahem. Yeah.  I am so dead.
好  听好我的重点  罗斯012---All right, look, here's the bottom line, Ross.
动作快的话  还可以补救  好吗012---This is fixable if we act fast, okay?
明天我请他吃早午餐  你可以表现得和善一点012---So I'll invite him to brunch tomorrow and you can make nice.
亲爱的  我试过了  但是没用012---Honey, I have tried to make nice. It doesn't work.
好  我知道我爸很难搞…012---Okay. Look, I realize my father is difficult...
所以你心胸要放大一点012---...but that's why you have got to be the bigger man here.
亲爱的  我可以心胸大一点012---Look, sweetie, I could be the bigger man. I could be the biggest man.
我心胸可以超大的  但情况还是不会改变012---I could be a big, huge, giant man and it still wouldn't make a difference.
除了把他抓起来说 "你得喜欢我  小医生"之外012---Except that I could pick your father up and say, "Like me. Like me, tiny doctor."
好  你可不可以再试一次  就当作是为了我012---Okay, well, can't you just try it one more time, Ross? For me? For me?
瑞秋  一场早午餐  是不能解决问题的012---Rachel, one brunch is not gonna solve anything.
面对事实吧  我们就是合不来012---You've gotta face it. We're never gonna get along.
好  你就是得试试看012---Okay, well, you are just going to have to.
懂吗  我已经有两个  无法共处一室的父母012---Okay? I've already got a mother and father who cannot stay in the same room.
我不想再多你一个012---I don't want to have a separate room for you too.
好…012---Okay, okay. Okay.
我去买甜甜圈012---I'll get the bagels.
