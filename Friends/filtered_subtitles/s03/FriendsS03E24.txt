你怎么知道012---How do you know?
他是近水楼台先得月  我知道012---He's got access. I know.
我就是感觉得到012---It's a feeling you get.
就像穿到别人的保龄球鞋012---Like when you're in somebody else's bowling shoes?
没错012---That's the one.
你去了彼特家  发生什么事012---So you went to Pete's. What happened?
我为什么这么背012---Why is this happening to me?
也许是我的伤口害的012---Maybe it's my wound.
算了012---Forget it.
你的伤还没好012---It's not healed yet?
它一直在渗血012---It's oozing!

不好意思  我在谈私事012---I'm trying to have a private conversation.
我要纸巾  请拿给我012---Can I have a napkin? Could you please hand me a napkin?

够了012---Enough!
你不再是我的朋友了012---And you are no longer my friend!
我们断交   一刀两断012---We are finished! Nada! No more!

彼特想告诉你什么消息012---What was the big news Pete wanted to tell you?
还是我该改叫你  摩妮卡贝克太太012---Or should I say, "Mrs. Monica Becker"?
保留你的姓  不要用他的姓012---Oh, keep your name. Don't take his name.
他没有向我求婚012---He didn't ask me to marry him.
那绝对不要用他的姓012---Aw. Then definitely don't take his name!
他要参加一个什么…012---He wanted to tell me he's going to compete in some Ultimate...
终极格斗比赛012---...Fighting Competition thingy.
彼特   那是什么012---Pete? Why? What is it?
我也不清楚  有点像摔角012---I don't know exactly. It's sort of like wrestling.
但不用穿表演服012---Oh? But without the costumes.
那是玩真的  非常野蛮012---And it's not fake. It's totally brutal.
两个人在场中厮杀  规则是"没有规则"012---It's two guys in the ring and the rules are, "There are no rules"!
所以可以咬人  扯别人的头发012---You can bite and pull people's hair and stuff?
都可以  除了戳眼睛和鱼钩手012---Anything goes except eye-gouging and fish-hooking.
什么是鱼钩手   就是…012---What's fish-hooking? What's fish-hook...
谢了  不然还真难形容012---Thanks. That would have been hard to describe.
那是什么味道012---What is that taste?
我的手很干净  我刚帮鸭子洗完澡012---My hands are totally clean. I just gave the duck a bath.

团队当中没有小我012---There is no I in "team."
但喝了酒就不是那么回事了  回我那里去吧012---Yes, but there's two in "martini." So, everybody, back to my office.
那个嬉皮笑脸的  你叫什么名字012---You! Chuckles. What's your name?
我姓宾  很抱歉  我只是…012---It's Bing, sir. I'm sorry. I was just...
我听到你说的话了  很有趣  我喜欢012---No, no. I heard what you said. Funny. I like funny.
我们要努力  也要尽兴012---This team's about hard work, but it's also about having fun.

老兄  你干什么012---Dude, what are you doing?
说得好  我上司今天一直拍我屁股  还一脸不在乎012---Thank you. My boss keeps slapping my butt and acting like it's no big deal.
你怎么做012---What'd you do about it?
什么都没做   我不想当…012---I didn't do anything. I didn't want to be the guy...
对上司拍屁股有意见的人012---...who has a problem with his boss slapping his bottom.
我觉得当那个人无所谓012---I gotta tell you, I think it's okay to be that guy.
也许像体育比赛时012---Maybe it's that jock thing.
美式足球员达阵之后都会拍来拍去012---You know, how football players pat each other after touchdowns.
我实在不了解男人012---You know, I don't understand guys.
我称赞摩妮卡煮的炖肉好吃时…012---I mean, I would never congratulate Monica on a great stew...
也不会抓她的胸部012---...by, you know, grabbing her boob.
如果炖肉真的很好吃012---I know. For a really great stew, you'd just...
应该直接把脸埋进去012---...stick your head in between them.
可以吃饭了吗012---Can we please go eat?
要吃什么  不要吃炖肉就好012---Yeah, what are we getting? Anything but stew.
从今以后  别让你的上司逮到机会012---So from now on, don't give your boss a chance to get you.
别把背部对着他012---Don't turn your back to him.
也可以给他一个教训012---Or you could teach him a lesson, you know?
你可以在屁股上涂很臭的东西012---What you do is rub something that smells really bad on your butt, right?
他拍了你之后  手就会很臭012---Then when he goes to smack you, his hand will smell.
有什么很臭的东西可以拿来涂012---Now, what could you rub on your butt that would smell bad?
如果乔伊是总统该怎么办012---What if Joey was President?

我可以帮罗斯介绍女朋友吗012---...but would it be okay with you if I set Ross up on a date?
跟谁012---Oh. Uh, with who?
我的朋友邦妮  她一直觉得罗斯很可爱012---My friend Bonnie. She always thought Ross was cute...
你们既然分手了  她问我能不能牵线012---...and she asked if I could set it up.
如果你会在意…  邦妮是哪一个012---But if that's not cool... Which one is Bonnie?

不高不矮012---Average height...

是啊  我又开始戴胸罩了012---Oh, yeah. Well, I just started wearing bras again.
一定是这个原因012---Oh, that must be it.
祝你们玩得愉快012---Have fun tonight.
谢了  你们也是012---Thanks. You too.
你说她是光头012---You said she was bald.
以前是  现在不是012---She was bald. She's not now.
你怎么没说她有长头发012---How could you not tell me she has hair?
我很少提到别人有长头发012---I don't know. I hardly ever say that about people.
这简直是太好了012---Oh, well this is just perfect!
对不起  你不是说没关系吗012---Well, I'm sorry. I thought you said it was okay.

那家伙踩着你的脖子把你踩昏012---That guy stood on your neck until you passed out.
我告诉你一个故事012---Let me tell you a story.
我着手研发的摩斯865   你以为是一夕成功吗012---When I set out to create MOSS 865, do you think it happened overnight?
不是   摩斯一代烧毁我爸的车库012---No. There was MOSS 1 that burned down my dad's garage.
摩斯二代只能排一月的行程表012---There was MOSS 2 that would only schedule appointments in January.
此外还有862次失败经验012---And 862 others that I learned from.
我从这场比赛中就学到   绝不能让对手踩我的脖子012---Just like I learned from this fight never to let a guy stand on my neck.
你之前不知道012---You didn't know that already?
我会越来越强012---Look, I'm gonna get better.
好吗  我保证012---Okay? I promise you.
好012---Okay.
要强很多012---Just get a lot better.

是啊012---Yeah.
对  问题就在这里012---That was the problem.

我很紧张012---I'm really nervous.
谢谢012---Thank you.
你跟邦妮怎么样了012---So how did it go with Bonnie?
这个我得告诉你  我没想到我会喜欢她012---Oh, I gotta tell you, I wasn't expecting to like her at all.
我目前根本没打算要喜欢别人012---I actually wasn't expecting to like anyone right now.
但她真的很棒012---But she's really terrific.
真糟糕012---It's too bad.
我是说我喜欢她012---No, I'm saying I liked her.
你不必为一颗树放弃整片森林012---There are other fish in the sea.

九次012---Nine times.
害我得擦护肤液012---I had to put on lotion.
不过没关系  我明天要做个实验012---But it'll be okay. Tomorrow, I conduct an experiment.
要是顺利  我的屁股  就没人会拍了012---And if all goes as planned, my butt will be smack-free.
比赛结束012---Fight's over!
不好意思   道格012---Excuse me, Doug?
超级体育迷012---Hey there, sports fan!
宾   数据做好了吗012---Bing! You got those numbers for me?
没有  我没做012---No. I didn't do them.
你忘了012---Oh. You forgot?
不是   我就是没做012---No, I just didn't do them.
我跟朋友出去  喝了两杯012---Instead, I hung out with some friends and had a couple of beers.
所以我不值得表扬  不管是言语上…012---So I certainly don't deserve praise. Verbal...
或其他方式012---...or otherwise.
我昨晚也醉了  是某个美女送我回家的012---I got tanked myself last night. Pretty dicey drive home.

道格012---Doug! Hmm?
我对你表达自我的方式  感觉有点不舒服012---I'm a little bit uncomfortable with the way that you express yourself.
你是说我经常骂脏话吗012---Is it the swearing? Is it the constant swearing?
如果是的话  你可以去死吧012---Because I gotta tell you, if it is, you can just kiss my ass!
不是骂脏话的事  而是…012---No. It's not about the swearing. It's more about...
你偶尔会…012---...the way that you occasionally...
把热情集中在…012---...concentrate your enthusiasm...
我的屁股上012---...on my buttocks.
别误会   我了解你的情绪012---Don't get me wrong, I appreciate the sentiment.
只不过我的臀部很敏感012---It's just that I have a rather sensitive posterior.
而且别人都在嫉妒012---And besides, it's making all the other guys jealous.
别再说了  你讲这些话  确实很有种012---Well, say no more. You know, it takes guts to bring this up.
宾  很好012---Bing, you're okay.
你要住在满身大汗的巨人的上衣口袋012---Would you rather live in the shirt pocket of a sweaty giant...
还是他的排水管里012---...or inside his shower drain?
天哪012---Oh, my God.
你看   是罗斯和那个女的012---Look. It's Ross and that girl.
看  有排蚂蚁  他们在同心协力  菲比012---Look at that! It's a line of ants! They're working as a team!
噢  对  罗斯好像要跟她分手了012---Right. Oh, yeah. It looks like Ross is breaking up with her.
希望他不要太狠012---I hope he lets her down easy.
你看  他们没有要分手  看看他们012---Look at that! They are not breaking up! Look at them!
那是第二次约会012---You know what that is? A second date, that's what that is.
你看  她把手放到他的大腿上012---Look, she just put her hand on his thigh.
小意思  她在性方面很主动012---That's nothing. She's very sexually aggressive.
天哪012---Oh, God!
都是你不好  他爱上她了  他会娶她   都是你的错012---It's your fault. Now he loves her. He'll marry her. It's all your fault.
你自己说没关系的012---You said it was okay.
你说她以前是光头012---You said she was bald!
是以前…012---Was! Was, was, was!
我们得想个办法   拆散他们012---We can't let it happen. We have to do something. We have to break them up.
进去帮她剃光头  你欠我一个光头女012---Just go in there and shave her head! You owe me one bald girl!
你先深呼吸012---Okay, first of all, breathe.
再来  我实在不懂012---Second of all, I don't get it.
不是你决定要跟罗斯分手的吗012---Aren't you the one that decided you didn't want to be with Ross?
是的012---Yes.
他不是你的朋友吗   你不希望他快乐吗012---Well, isn't he your friend? Don't you want him to be happy?
希望012---Yes.
所以呢012---So?
但是我没想到这么快  他就这么开心了012---It's just, you know, I didn't expect him to be this happy so soon.
完了  怎么了012---Oh, no. What?
蚂蚁被我们压死了012---We killed them all!
没这么严重   这是以防万一012---It's not as bad as it looks. It's a precaution.
我的脊椎骨不能动012---I'm not supposed to move my spine.
你要放弃了吧012---Please tell me you're stopping now.
我没事   今晚要我上场都行012---I'm fine. I'd fight tonight if they'd let me.
你看这个圆012---Now, see this circle I'm marking off here?
这是我的恐怖区012---This is my Zone of Terror.
你疯了  你一定要放弃012---You are insane! You've got to give this up!
除非我拿到格斗冠军   我才会放弃012---I can't until I'm the Ultimate Fighter.
我会成功的012---I will do it.
