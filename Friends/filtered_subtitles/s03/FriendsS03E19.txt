我一直都暗恋着你012---I've kind of had this, uh... This crush on you.
因为那时你跟罗斯在一起  我什么事都不能做012---But since you were with Ross, I didn't do anything about it.
现在你们分手了  我真的很想约你出去012---Now that you're not, I'd really like to ask you out sometime.
那是我现在正要做的事012---So that's what I'm doing now.

被《青春节奏》票选为  最想交往的外科医生012---Voted most datable neurosurgeon by Teen Beat?
不  不是那样的012---No, that's not it.
你是肥皂剧演员012---So you're a soap actor.
能演出真正的戏剧  你一定非常兴奋012---Well, this must be exciting for you, being in a real play. Hmm?
我演过戏  我是认真的演员012---Hey, I've done plays before. I'm a serious actor.
是那部广告012---That infomercial.
牛奶洒出来的广告012---For the milk-carton-spout thing.
你是不会倒牛奶的那个家伙012---You're the guy who doesn't know how to pour milk.

嗯012---Huh.
我现在不想跟任何人约会012---I mean, I think I'd say no to anybody right now.
我站在那里  真的很奇怪012---Oh, but it was so strange. I mean, I'm standing there...
那个迷人可爱的男人要跟我约会012---...with this charming, cute guy who's asking me to go out with him...
我可以那么做012---...which I'm allowed to do...
可是我觉得有罪恶感  像是我背叛了罗斯012---...and I felt guilty, you know, like I'd be cheating on Ross or something.
好吧  或许那表示012---Wow. So, okay, maybe that means...
你还没有忘记罗斯  还有  你跟你爸之间有问题012---...that you're not over Ross yet and you have issues with your father.
我跟我爸没问题  好吧  或许那只是罗斯的关系012---I don't have any issues with my father. Okay, so it's probably just the Ross thing.
我讨厌这个女人  我恨她012---I hate this woman. I hate her.
她跟剧团里的人说广告的事012---She told everyone in the company about that infomercial...
现在老找我帮他们开饮料罐012---...and now they all keep asking me to open their drinks.
好吗  每次我办不到时  他们都会嘲笑我012---Okay? And whenever I can't do it, they're all, like, laughing at me.

你觉得她想谈什么   或许她终于冷静下来012---Wow. What do you think she wants? Well, maybe the crazy fog has lifted...
了解到没有我的生活…012---...and she realizes that life without me...
太逊了012---...sucks.
有可能  你非常可爱  如果我跟你分手  我也会想你012---It's possible. You are very lovable. I'd miss you if I broke up with you.
我只是想支持你012---Just trying to be supportive.

不012---No.
罗斯012---Ross.
看起来我们都该有新生活了012---It just seems that, you know, it's time we, you know, move on.

对  对012---Yes. Yeah.
对  我是那么想的  太好了012---Yes, I do. Good.
我真的是那么想的012---Yeah, I really do.
嘿012---Hey...
这是礼物012---This was a gift.
罗斯  那是你从博物馆礼品店  免费拿回来的012---Ross, you got that for free from the museum gift shop.
它还是礼物012---It's still a gift.
我从礼品店拿回来的012---I got it from the gift shop.
好吧  马克杯给我  我可以留下马克杯012---Okay. All right. Give me the mug. I'll keep the mug.
不  别可怜我  事实上…012---No. You know, don't do me any favors. In fact, where...
我其他的东西在哪里  譬如我的…012---Where's the rest of my stuff? Huh? Like my, um...
这本书是我的012---Hey. This book is mine.
还有你穿着睡觉的汗衫呢  我要把它拿回来  没错012---And that T-shirt you sleep in? I'd like that back too. Yes, I do.
你知道我多爱那件汗衫  你从来不穿那件汗衫012---You know how much I love that T-shirt. You never even wear that T-shirt.
我只是想帮助你追寻新生活012---I'm just trying to help you move on.
你真是个小气的家伙012---Oh, you are a petty man.
你是个小气…012---You are a petty, petty...
小气  小气012---Petty... ...petty, petty...
小心眼  小心眼012---...small... ...small...
你是不爽才会这么做012---You are so just doing this out of spite.
不…012---Uh-uh. No, no, no.
我要一直穿着它  我喜欢这件汗衫012---I'm gonna wear this all the time. I love this shirt.
你15岁后就没穿过它  你根本就穿不下了012---You haven't worn that since you were 15. It doesn't even fit you anymore.
对  对012---Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah.
好吧012---Oh, okay, okay, okay.
如果你不介意的话  我要拿着我的东西…012---Now, if you don't mind, I'm gonna take the rest of my stuff...
去放轻松了012---...and relax...
穿着我最喜欢的汗衫012---...in my favorite shirt.
祝你有个愉快的夜晚012---You have a pleasant evening.
你是亿万富翁012---So you're, like, a zillionaire.
你的年纪跟我们一样大012---And you're our age. You're our age.
你知道吗  你该买下一整州012---You know what? You should, like, buy a state...
把州名改成你的名字012---...and then just name it after yourself.
什么  譬如说彼特达科塔012---What, like, "Pete Dakota"?
或是密西西比彼特012---Or "Mississi-Pete."
我知道了  彼特芝加哥012---Ooh, ooh, I got it: "Pete Chicago."
芝加哥不是一个州   乔伊012---That's not a state, Joe.
密西西比彼特就是吗012---Oh, and "Mississi-Pete" is?
我得走了  后会有期012---I gotta go, so, uh, I'll see you guys later.
好吧  你的年纪跟我们一样大  好的012---Okay. You're our age. Okay.
明天见012---So, uh, are we on for tomorrow?
当然012---Absolutely.
快走吧012---Now get out of here, you.
好吧  我该摸的地方都摸过了012---Okay, I'm running out of places I can touch him.
我有毛病吗012---Is there something wrong with me?
为什么我只喜欢  跟我没有未来的男人012---I mean, why am I only attracted to guys where there's no future?
他们不是太老  就是太年轻012---Either they're too old or they're too young.
彼特为我疯狂012---And there's Pete, who's crazy about me...
他是那么完美  我对他是手到擒来012---...and he's absolutely perfect, and there's, like, zip going on.
说真的  我真的有毛病吗012---Seriously. Does it sound like something's wrong with me?
对  应该是吧012---Yeah, kind of.
开心  我该那么做吗  维多012---Happy? Is that what I'm supposed to be, Vic?
开心012---Happy?
你何不告诉我  你想怎么做012---Well, why don't you tell me what you're supposed to be? Huh?
因为我就是搞不懂012---Because I sure as hell can't figure it out.
我跟你说话  你没反应012---I talk to you, and nothing.
你看着我  完全没反应012---You look at me, and it's nothing.
就是没反应012---Nothing.
太好了012---Tasty.
我真的开始觉得你们有一段情  太棒了012---I'm really starting to feel like you guys have a history. It's nice.
我对这场戏有个问题  请说012---I have a question about this scene. Yes.
我不了解  为什么安德丽娜会喜欢维多012---Well, I don't understand why Adrianne's attracted to Victor.
要抽丝剥茧012---Peel the onion.
首先他长得很帅012---First of all, he's good-looking.
我想我的角色还需要其他的理由012---I think my character is gonna need a bit more of a reason than that.
这个理由可以吗  剧本是那么写的012---Oh, hey, how about this one? Uh, it says so in the script.
我也不知道  为什么我的角色会喜欢你012---You know, I don't know why my character likes you either.
剧本上写着你是个贱人012---I mean, it says in the script here that you're a bitch.
剧本才没有那么写  我的剧本就是那么写的012---It doesn't say that in the script. It does in mine.
我可以把它吹干  或是涂发胶  那一点都不重要012---I can blow-dry it, I can put gel on it. It doesn't matter.
中间那个部分012---I still wind up with this little cowlick-y thing...
还是翘了起来  真的很讨厌012---...on the middle part of my head. It's so annoying.
你觉得困扰吗   是你让我觉得困扰012---Does it bug you? You bug me.
你有可能没看到这一幕吗012---Is there any chance you didn't see that?
罗斯  别再那么做了012---Ross, you gotta stop, okay?
你不能连续盯着窥视孔三小时012---You can't just stare through the peephole for three hours.
你的眼睛会坏掉的012---You're gonna get peep-eye.
我就知道  我一直都知道她喜欢他012---I knew it. I knew it. I always knew she liked him.
她可以拒绝的  看看她做了什么012---She'd say no, but here we are, right?
我们才刚分手  她马上就跟他约会012---We just broke up, first thing she does.
你们不是才刚分手012---You didn't just break up.
才三星期而已012---Hey, it's been, like, three weeks.
你在以为你们分手后三小时  就跑去跟别人上床012---You slept with somebody three hours after you thought you broke up.
子弹飞出去的速度都没那么快012---I mean, bullets have left guns slower.
他们回来了012---Here they come. Here they... Oh.
如果她跟他吻别  我发誓我要自杀012---If she kisses him good night, I'm gonna kill myself. I swear.
我看不下去了012---I can't watch.
快点  约会结束了012---Come on. Date over. Date over.
太好了  她要进去了  好的012---Here we go. She's going in. Okay.
她要进去了  等一下  他也进去了012---She's going in. Ha, ha. Wait. He's going in.
他要进去了012---He's going in.
门关上了  门关着我看不到012---The door's closed. I can't see anything with the door closed.
发明门的人可以安息了012---And the inventor of the door rests happily in his grave.
好吧  我得想想办法  必须阻止他们012---Okay, I have to do something. I mean, I have to stop it.
阻止他们做什么  我不知道012---Stop what? I don't know.
但直觉告诉我说  换作是我  我们会做什么012---But I have a feeling that my being there will do it.
我要过去借东西012---I'll go over and I will borrow something.
果汁  我需要果汁  不012---Juice. I need juice. No.
不可以  帮帮我012---You can't. A little help.
我得阻止他们  我是你的朋友012---They must be stopped. I am your friend...
我不能让你这么做012---...and I am not gonna let you do this.
你真的好壮012---You are surprisingly strong.
我需要果汁  人们需要果汁  听着012---I need juice. People need juice. Look, man...
人们需要果汁  他们需要… 听我说012---People need juice. Juice. They need... Listen to me.
她开始新生活了  就算不是他  也会是别人012---She's moving on, okay? If it's not this guy, it's gonna be somebody else.
如果你考虑租用我的窥视孔012---And unless you're thinking about subletting my peephole...
你要接受事实  你们结束了012---...you are gonna have to get used to the fact that the relationship is over.
好吗  你们结束了012---Okay, man? It's over.
对  好吧  好吧012---Yeah, okay. Okay.
我真的很想她012---It's just I miss her so much.
我知道012---I know.
为什么你们的马克杯底写着编号012---Why do all your coffee mugs have numbers on the bottom?
那样  摩妮卡才能加以追踪012---Oh, that's so Monica can keep track.
如果有杯子不见了  她会说" 27号杯在哪里"012---That way, if one of them is missing, she can be like, "Where's number 27?"
你知道吗012---You know what?
不  我想我不要知道012---No, and I don't think I'm gonna want to.
我没办法012---I can't do this.
对  所以我不想知道012---Yep. Yep. That's what I didn't want to know.
对  马克  我这么做是不对的012---Yeah. Oh, Mark, I'm just doing this for the wrong reasons, you know?
我只是想报复罗斯012---I'm just doing it to get back at Ross.
抱歉  这对你来说不公平012---I'm sorry. It's not very fair to you.
公平  天啊  你知道吗012---Ah. Fair, shmair. You know?
听着  如果你想报复罗斯  我可以帮你012---Look, you wanna get back at Ross, I am here for you.
真的012---Really.
不  我是说我们就在这张沙发上  好好地报复他吧012---No, no. I say we get back at him right here on this couch. Right here.
喔  天啊012---Oh, my God.
我真的很抱歉012---I'm sorry about this.
没关系012---That's okay.
你确定吗   对012---You sure? Yeah.
我可以回家自己报复他012---I can just go home and get back at him by myself.
那会是21世纪的盘尼西林012---And should become the penicillin of the 21 st century.
现在这家医院要迈开大步012---And so today, this hospital is about to take major steps...
领导这场革命012---...toward leading that revolution.
这真的太讽刺了  我能问你一件事吗012---It is truly ironic. Hey. Can I ask you something?
目前是什么状况012---Where are we?
看到那些医生跟护士012---Well, with all these doctors and nurses...
我想应该是矮人马戏团012---...I'm gonna say, Midget Rodeo.
跟我说实话012---Just tell me the truth.
好吧012---Okay.
我没跟你提过这件事012---Um, you know, I don't think I told you this...
我刚刚结束一段认真的恋情012---...but, um, I just recently got out of a really serious relationship.
对  那不是一年前的事吗012---Oh, right. Wasn't that like a year ago?
我跟你说过了012---So I did tell you.
好吧  那不是问题012---Okay, well, you know, that's not really the thing.
问题是我现在的生活状态是012---The thing is, is that right now I'm just in a place in my life...
我只想好好做自己012---...where I just need to focus on me. - Mm.
你了解我的意思吗  对  我知道012---Do you know what I mean? Oh, yeah, I know.
我真的很想喜欢你  但你不喜欢我  好吧012---I so want to be attracted to you. But you're not. Okay. Good.
对不起012---I'm sorry.
你知道吗  别那么说  这不是…012---You know what? Don't be. This is not...
别那么说  真的没那么糟糕012---Don't be, because it's not so bad.
是吗  对  我知道我不是邦·乔维012---It's not? Yeah. I know I'm no Jon Bon Jovi.
或是你喜欢的那一型012---Or someone you find attractive.
我只是觉得…012---I just think, you know...
或许你终究会爱上我012---...that you might end up feeling differently.
听着  我没有恶意012---Well, look, I don't want this to come out wrong...
但我刚刚拒绝了你  你似乎还蛮有自信的012---...but, uh, you seem awfully confident for a guy I just told I wasn't attracted to.
对  我超迷人的对吧012---Yeah, stupidly charming, isn't it?
听着  你要吃点东西吗012---Uh, listen. Let's... You wanna get something to eat?
这里让人觉得压力好大012---Because this place is kind of depressing.
欢迎幕后大功臣彼特贝克先生012---Now the man who made this possible, Mr. Peter Becker.
等一下012---One second.
我想这个小镇容不下我们两个012---I don't think this town is big enough for the both of us to relax in.
拔枪吧012---Draw.
我什么都没做012---I wasn't doing anything.
她又做了什么012---Uh-oh. What did she do now?
她念过耶鲁戏剧系  她就觉得她是自从有面包片以来012---Just because she went to Yale Drama, she thinks she's, like, the greatest actress...
最伟大的女演员012---...since sliced bread.
面包片  超棒的马克白夫人012---Ah, Sliced Bread. A wonderful Lady Macbeth.
天啊  我恨她  我讨厌她说"我超有天分的"012---God, I just... I hate her. I hate her with her "Oh, I'm so talented"...
"我真的好漂亮  我闻起来好香"012---...and "Oh, I'm so pretty," and "Oh, I smell so good."
我想有人喜欢上某人了012---I think somebody has a crush on somebody.
钱德  拜托你专心在我的问题上012---Hey, Chandler, can we please try and stay focused on my problem here?
你知道吗012---You know?
我是在说你  大怪胎012---I'm talking about you, you big, big freak.
你疯了012---Oh. You're out of your mind.
过去48小时以来  你满口都是她012---Hey, you've done nothing but talk about her for the last 48 hours.
如果你还在念小学012---If you were in school yard...
你会拉她的马尾  把她推倒012---...you'd be pulling her pigtails and pushing her down now.
是吗  为什么我满脑子都是她012---Oh, yeah? Then how come I keep thinking about her...
还有春梦呢012---...in all these sexual scenarios and stuff, huh?

你何不告诉我  你想怎么做012---Well, why don't you tell me what you're supposed to be, huh?
因为我就是搞不懂012---Because I sure as hell can't figure it out.
我跟你说话  你没反应012---I talk to you, and it's nothing.
你看着我  完全没反应012---You look at me, and nothing.
就是没反应012---Nothing.

嘿012---Hey.
为什么不是 "蜘蛛人"012---Why isn't it "Spiderman"?
譬如葛德曼或席佛曼012---You know, like Goldman, Silverman?
因为那不是他的姓氏012---Because it's not his last name.
真的  没错  他又不是…012---It isn't? No, it's not, like...
菲尔史派德曼012---Like Phil Spiderman.
他是变身为蜘蛛的…012---He's a spider...
人012---...man.
葛德曼是姓氏012---You know, like, uh... Like Goldman is a last name.
可是根本就没有金人012---But there's no gold man.
好吧012---Oh, okay.

对了  罗斯把你的东西拿过来012---By the way, Ross dropped by a box of your stuff.
我早就知道他会那么做012---Oh. Well, I guess I had that one coming.
我要把它拿去丢了  或许只是一堆洗发精跟…012---I'm just gonna throw it out. It's probably just a bunch of shampoo and...
怎么了012---Something wrong?
不  没事012---Hmm. No. Nothing.
金人有什么样的力量012---So, uh, what kind of powers would Gold Man have?
好吧  他能点石成金012---Okay. Well, he would turn things to gold.
如果那本来就是黄金呢  他就完成了他的使命012---What about things that are already gold? Ah. His work is done.
