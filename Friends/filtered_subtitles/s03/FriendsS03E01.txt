我就想〝一定是老鼠或负鼠〞012---So I thought,"Oh, it's a mouse or a possum."
然后我就想  好吧…012---Then I realized, like, okay...
老鼠或负鼠怎么会有钱打电话呢012---...where would a mouse or a possum get the money to make the phone call?

什么012---What?
这些是理查的头发012---It's some of Richard's hair!
我该拿这些怎么办012---What do I do with this?
第一件事就是把它从我身边拿开012---Getting it away from me would be job one.
这么说有点奇怪  但我并不想把它丢掉012---It's weird, but I don't want to throw this away.
这些是我仅有属于他的东西012---This is all I have left of him.
恶心的…012---Gross...
排水管的头发012---...drain hair.
真好玩  好像有一个小人在你的麦片里淹死了012---Cool! Oh, it looks like a tiny little person drowning in your cereal.
我是怎么了  你需要一些睡眠012---God, what is wrong with me? You need to get some sleep.
我需要的是理查012---I need to get some Richard.
你跟他分手是有原因的012---You broke up with him for a reason.
我知道…我只是不想再这么想他012---I know. I know.I'm just so tired of missing him.
不愿再去想  他为何不打来  他为何都没打来012---Tired of wondering why he hasn't called. Why hasn't he?
可能因为你叫他别再打来012---Maybe because you told him not to?

好  谁先来  罗斯012---All right, who's first, huh? Ross?
钱德是我们的朋友  而珍妮丝能让他快乐012---Chandler's our friend,and Janice makes him happy.
所以我们就成熟点  接受她012---So I say we be adult about it and accept her.
这个先归类在B计划012---We'll call that Plan B.

太棒了012---Cool! Oh.
罗斯也会去吗012---Is Ross going too?
不  是珍妮丝012---No. Janice.
珍妮丝012---Janice?

我们总是一起去的  我们是冰球三兄弟啊012---We always go together. We're like The Three Hockey-teers, you know?
也许是我误会你了  你是否反感珍妮丝012---I may be way out on a limb here,but do you have a problem with Janice?
没有012---No!
对啦…012---Yes...
天啊  我该怎么说012---Oh, God, how do I say this? Uh...
你知道希腊餐厅里那个头发很蓬的女孩子012---You know that girl from there staurant with the hair?
那个我很讨厌的女孩子  她快把我逼疯了012---Ooh! That girl that I hate? Ugh! She drives me crazy. Ew.
听着  我不讨厌珍妮丝  只是她令人难以忍受012---Look, I don't hate Janice. She's just a lot to take, you know?
你终于说出来了012---Well, there you go. Oh.
别那样看着我012---Don't look at me like that.
以前她也快把你逼疯了  记得吗012---She drove you nuts before too, remember?
但是我现在为她疯狂  这次可能是来真的012---I'm crazy about her now.This could be the real thing.
我是说〝真的〞012---Capital R, capital T!
别担心  我语法没错012---Don't worry, those are the right letters.
你到底要我说什么012---Look, what do you want me to say?
我要你说你喜欢她012---I want you to say that you like her!
我说不出来  这像是一种化学作用012---I can't. It's like this chemical thing,you know?
每次她一开始笑  我就想…012---Every time she starts laughing,I just wanna...
想把我的手臂拔下来  我就能往她身上砸012---...pull my arm off so I have something to throw at her.
谢谢你的努力012---Thanks for trying.
对了  根本就没有罗斯摩尔伯爵012---Oh, and by the way,there is no Count Rush more!
那是谁在罗斯摩尔山上塑了那些总统肖像012---Then who's the guy that painted the faces on the mountain?
你怎么可以告诉她012---Ugh.How could you tell her?
我想又没什么大不了的012---I didn't think it would be that big a deal!
她认为没什么大不了的012---Oh. She didn't think it would be a big deal!
你在跟谁讲话012---Who are you talking to when you do that?
这些应该是我们之间很私密的对话012---Look, that was supposed to bea private, personal thing between us.
菲比是我的闺密  好吗  我们无话不谈的012---Phoebe is my girlfriend, okay? We tell each other everything.
男人也一样啊012---Guys do the same thing.
我是说  那些更衣室里的谈话呢012---I mean, what about all that locker-room stuff?
那不一样  我们会谈像是谁跟脱衣舞娘约会012---That's different.That's like, uh, who dated a stripper?
或谁在史坦登岛渡轮后面做爱012---Or who did it on the back of the Staten Island ferry?
这两个都是乔伊吧  是啊012---Both of those Joey? Yeah.
但我们不谈自己的女友…012---But you don't talk about your girlfriend...
还有和女友之间做的亲密的事012---...and the intimate stuff you do with her.
连最好的朋友也不谈  不啊012---Not even with your best friend? No.
真可悲啊012---That is so sad.
你们错过太多乐趣了012---You're missing out on so much.
那是种交心与分享的感觉…012---I mean, the bonding and the sharing...
并知道他们也和你经历过一样的事012---...and knowing they're going through the same thing you are.
那你们什么都跟对方说吗012---Oh. So, what, you tell each other everything?
差不多啊012---Pretty much.
你们有没有谈过那次一夜五次的事012---Did you talk aboutthe Night of Five Times?
你有没有告诉她们那次一夜五次的事012---Do you tell people about the Night of Five Times?
亲爱的  你那次是跟卡萝012---Uh, honey, that was with Carol.

和缓陵流动着的喷泉012---...and the trickling fountains...
还有低声轻语的小溪产生平静的音律012---...and the calming sounds of the babbling brook.
好  一点用也没有012---Okay, this isn't working. Oh.
我还是醒着的  而且我得去上厕所012---I'm still awake,and now I have to pee.
我听说…012---So I hear...
你讨厌我012---...you hate me!
我没说我讨厌你  我可是很小心的012---I, uh, never said hate.I was very careful about that.
有人私下告诉我你想扯下手臂  丢到我身上012---A little birdie told me you wanting to rip your arm off and throw it at me.
这样你就觉得我讨厌你  你也太断章取义了吧012---And you got "hate" from that? You're taking a big leap there, I, uh...
好吧012---All right, fine, fine, fine!
这种情形  我们得想点策略012---We have got to do something about our little situation here.
这是我的主意012---So this is my idea.

是  我知道我睡在你们的隔壁012---Yeah, I know. Ha.I sleep in the next room.
我今天去了邮局012---I went down to the post office...
寄来的是我订的录影带012---...and it turns out it was those videos that I ordered...

正在亲热…012---...and, uh, ahem, you know,you're fooling around...
脑袋里突然出现一些疯狂的念头012---...and you get all these mental images in your brain?
就像超级名模艾尔或是影印店的那个女孩吗012---Like Elle MacPhersonor the girl at the Xerox place?
穿了肚脐环的那个  我就知道012---With the belly button ring? Oh. Oh! I know.
但是突然之间你忽然想到你妈012---And then all of a sudden, your mom pops into your head.
然后你就想〝妈  快走开啦〞012---And you're, like,"Mom, get out of here!"
当然  这之后你就完全没情绪再想其他人了012---But after that,you can't think of anything else.
而你正在做的事又不能停止  所以你就好像…012---And you can't stop what you're doing.So it's kind of like you're...
你知道…012---...you know, you know...
你不知道012---You don't know!
你妈妈012---Your mom?
你是说跟你妈一起  你究竟有什么毛病012---You're telling me about your mom? What's the matter with you?
你说… 我说要〝分享〞 不是〝吓唬人〞012---You said...I said "share," not "scare"!
你给我坐到那边去012---Go sit over there!
我们回来了012---We're back!Hey.

还是谢谢你的努力012---I appreciate you giving it a shot.
但是有一点可喜的是…012---But you know, the good thing...
我们整天在一起而我还能存活012---...is that we spent the whole day together and I survived.
更了不起的是  她也做到了012---And what's even more amazing,so did she. Ha, ha.
今天是《大都会》主场的球棒日012---It was Bat Day at Shea Stadium.
我想这还了不起的012---I guess that's something.
天啊  这可是大事呢012---Oh, man, that's huge!
现在我知道我可以待在她旁边  表示…012---Now I know I can stand to bearound her. Which means...
我可以和你一起出去…012---...I get to hang out with you.
反正这就是我的重点012---Which is kind of the whole point anyway. Ha, ha.
