等一下  你说这个女演员012---Wait a minute. You're telling me this actress person...
是唯一你渴望得到她  她却不要你的女人012---...is the only woman you ever wanted who didn't want you back?
对012---Yeah.
天啊012---Oh, my God.
你的人生都是这样吗012---Is this what it's like to be you?
你真的爱上她了吧  你不懂012---Wow, you're really crazy about her, huh? Oh. You have no idea.
我们在舞台上  我得吻她跟触摸她012---And when we're on-stage, I get to kiss her and touch her.
然后她跟导演回家012---But then she goes home with the director...
就像有人把我的心挖出来一样012---...and it's like somebody's ripping out my heart.
很高兴你也有这种感觉012---Oh, it's so great to see you feeling like this.
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
摩妮卡  今天早上爸打电话来012---Monica, uh, Dad called this morning...
席薇亚阿姨过世了012---...and, uh, Aunt Sylvia passed away.
太棒了012---Yes. Yes. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
我们都很震惊012---We were all pretty shaken up about it.
等一下  我是不是漏掉了什么事012---Wait, am I missing something?
我以为死亡只会带来悲伤012---Because I always thought death was supposed to be sad, in a way.
席薇亚阿姨012---Well, uh, Aunt Sylvia was...
不是个好人012---...well, not a nice person.
没错  她是个残忍爱挑剔的老太婆012---No, she was a cruel, cranky old bitch.
我很遗憾她过世了012---And I'm sorry she died.
爸说我得到娃娃屋了吗012---Did Dad say I get the dollhouse?
你得到娃娃屋了  我得到娃娃屋了012---You get the dollhouse.  I get the dollhouse.
娃娃住的房子  超棒的012---Wow. A house for dolls. That is so cool.
小时候我只有一个桶子012---When I was a kid, I had a barrel.
菲比  你把娃娃放在桶子里012---Uh, Pheebs, you had a barrel for a dollhouse?
不  只有桶子012---No, just a barrel.
你知道吗  你可以玩我的娃娃屋012---You know what? You can play with my dollhouse.
真的吗  随时都可以012---Really? Really? Any time you want.
小时候我只想玩这个娃娃屋012---When I was younger, all I wanted to do was to play with this dollhouse.
不行  它只能看  不能碰012---But no. It was to be looked at, but never played with.
以前我奶奶也是那么说我的012---My grandmother used to say that exact same thing to me.
《老友记》 第三季  第20集  娃娃屋012---Friends S03E20  The One with the Dollhouse
苏菲  瑞秋  嘿嘿012---Hey, Sophie. Hey, Rach.
嘿  嘿012---Hey.
谢谢你请我吃午餐  钱德  你不必陪我回办公室012---Thanks for lunch, Chandler. You didn't have to walk me here.
别客气  不成问题012---Oh, that's okay. No problem.
甜心  你知道我们不会  把女用内衣放在办公室里012---Honey, you do realize we don't keep the women's lingerie here in the office.
对  我知道012---Yes, I realize that.
夏季型录  那才是我要的东西012---Summer catalog.  That's the stuff.
瑞秋  我要凡赛斯的发票012---Rachel, I need the Versace invoice.
你好  你不是我的员工012---Hello. You don't work for me.
乔安娜  他是我的朋友钱德宾   乔安娜012---Joanna, this is my friend Chandler Bing. Joanna.
宾  非常不错的姓氏012---Bing? Heh. That's a great name.
谢谢  盖尔语的意思是 "你的火鸡熟了"012---Thanks, it's Gaelic for, "Thy turkey's done."
我得走了  幸会  幸会012---So, uh, I'm gonna go. Nice meeting you. You too.
再见  钱德012---Bye, Chandler.
他怎么了012---So, uh, what's wrong with him?
没事  他本来就呆呆的  我几乎不再注意到这一点012---Oh, nothing. He's just goofy like that. I actually hardly notice it anymore.
不  我是说他已婚  或有交往对象吗012---Oh, no, no, no. I mean, is he, um, married or involved with anyone?
不  他是单身  也没有跟任何人交往012---No, no. He's not married or involved with anyone.
瑞秋012---Oh, Rachel...
你知道吗  算了012---Actually, you know what? Forget it.
如果你要的话  我能帮你约他  真的吗012---I'll ask him for you if you want me to. Would you?
那不会显得我太悲惨绝望吗012---Or is it just too sad and desperate...
就跟苏菲会做的事一样012---...you know, something that Sophie would do?
我在这里  我知道012---I am here. I know that.
你们看012---Look at it.
壁纸有点褪色  没关系012---Wallpaper's a little faded. That's okay.
地毯有点松了012---Carpet's a little loose.
硬木地板012---Hardwood floors?
嘿  哈罗012---Hey. Oh! Hello.
喔  摩妮卡012---Oh, Monica.
好漂亮   我知道012---It's so beautiful. I know.
我来了  准备开始玩了  好吧012---So I'm here, ready to play. Hee-hee. Okay.
我带了一些东西来装饰娃娃屋   看吧012---I brought a bunch of stuff for the house, so check it out. Ha, ha.
这是什么012---What's this?
那是狗  每间屋子都该有狗012---That's a dog. Every house should have a dog.
我不要会在屋顶尿尿的狗012---Not one that can pee on the roof.
或许他会这么大   因为屋子是用辐射废弃物盖成的012---Well, maybe it's so big because the house was built on radioactive waste.
这是为了预防屋子打喷嚏吗012---And is this in case the house sneezes?
不  那是阁楼的鬼魂012---No. No, that's the ghost for the attic.
我不要鬼   没有人要鬼012---I don't want a ghost. Well, nobody wants a ghost.
但你有一个鬼012---But you've got one...
因为屋子盖在古老的印第安坟场上012---...because the house is sitting on an ancient Indian burial ground.
等一下   屋子用辐射废弃物盖成012---Wait a minute. The house was built on radioactive waste...
而且位于古老印第安坟场012---...and an ancient Indian burial ground?
不可能会有那种事012---Ha, ha. That would never happen.
好吧   显然你不太了解美国政府012---Okay, obviously you don't know much about the U.S. Government. Ha, ha.
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
我得跟你谈谈   没问题  什么事012---I need to talk to you. Sure. What's up?
抱歉  我是指钱德012---Oh, sorry. I meant Chandler.
我知道012---Heh. I know.
如果有事的话…012---Well, if something comes up...
我很高兴你们度过尴尬期了012---Well, I'm glad you guys are past that little awkward phase.
好吧  我的上司乔安娜   你离开后012---Okay. My boss, Joanna. When you left...
她开始问起你的事012---...she started asking questions about you.
看上眼了012---Ha, ha. Liked what she saw, huh?
她喜欢我的活力  对吧012---Dug my action, did she?
打探小钱钱的事012---Checking out the Chan Chan Man.
那真的…012---That was...
太不可思议了012---...surreal.
好吧  你觉得呢  你有兴趣吗012---Okay, what do you think? You interested at all?
对  她蛮酷的  也很迷人  我愿意012---Yeah, she seemed cool, attractive. I'll do it.
谢谢你  钱德  太棒了  她一定会爱死我的012---Oh, thank you, Chandler. This is great. She's gonna love me.
好吧  恐龙攻击  快点  大家躲进屋里012---Okay, dinosaur attack. Quick, everybody into the house. Aah!
好了  菲比  就那样  你知道吗  好吗012---All right, Phoebe, you know what? That's it. That's it. All right?
不准有恐龙  鬼或大狗  好吗012---No dinosaurs, no ghosts, no giant dogs, okay?
它们的尺寸不对  不是维多利亚时代风格  完全不配012---They're not the right size, they're not Victorian, and they just don't go.
好吧012---Okay.Fine.
来吧  恐龙  没想像力的屋子不欢迎我们012---Come, dinosaur. We're not welcome in the house of no imagination.
菲比  既然我们谈到这一点012---Uh, Pheebs, while we're hovering around the subject...
我只是想说恐龙不会汪汪叫012---...I just have to say that dinosaurs, they don't go, "Ruff."
小恐龙就会012---The little ones do.
凯特  早安012---Hey, Kate. Morning.
听着  我去了你提过的那家餐厅012---Listen, I, uh, went to that restaurant you talked about...
宝贝012---Hey, lovely.
来吧  我得跟你谈一下012---Come, talk to me for a minute.
我吃了那里的食物  真的很好吃  我点了鱼012---And I ate the food. It was good. I had the fish.
对  很不错012---Yeah, it was pretty good. Yeah.
嗨012---Hi.
我是萝伦  凯特的替补演员012---I'm Lauren. Kate's understudy.
嘿  乔伊崔比亚尼012---Oh. Hey. Joey Tribbiani.
我知道  我是你的超级粉丝012---I know. I'm a big fan of yours.
什么012---What?
以前我会调整课表  只为了在《我们的日子》012---I used to, um, schedule my classes so I could watch Dr. Drake Ramoray...
看到德瑞克雷莫瑞医生012---...on Days of our Lives.
不可能  真的吗012---Get out of here. Really?
当然012---Absolutely. Huh.
后来他们把你推下电梯井012---Oh, but then they went and dropped you down that elevator shaft.
对  他们真的杀了我012---Yeah, they gave me the shaft, all right.
你真的好有趣012---You're so funny.
听着  你排完戏要做什么012---Listen, um, what are you doing after rehearsal?
要不要去喝一杯012---Do you wanna get a drink or something?
那个嘛…012---Well, uh...
没问题  听起来不错012---Yeah. Yeah, sure. A drink sounds great.
酷啊  到时候见  好的012---Cool. I'll see you then. Okay. All right.
好吧  该开始演戏了  我会说话的道具们012---All right. It's time to act, my talking props.
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
大家看吧  看看我的新娃娃屋012---Look, everybody. Look at my new dollhouse.
看吧012---Ha, ha. Look, look.
这是什么012---Hey, what's this?
好吧   那是用溜滑梯代替楼梯  看吧012---Oh, okay. It's a slide instead of stairs. Look.
非常有趣   菲比012---Very interesting, Phoebe.
这是什么012---What's this?
甘草糖房间   家俱都可以吃012---The licorice room. You can eat all the furniture.
客人来的时候  可以睡在糖果床上面012---And when guests come over, they can stay on the Tootsie Roll-away bed.
这是史上最酷的屋子012---This is the coolest house ever.
谁要跟我一起到芬芳疗室012---Hey. Does anyone want to join me in the Aroma Room?
好吧  我要012---All right. I would.
各位012---Hey, guys? Guys.
你们看到我的新瓷器柜了吗012---Did you see my new china cabinet?
看吧012---Watch. Watch.
还有呢012---Ooh. And? And?
我爸的房子也会那样012---Hey, my father's house does that.
好吧  怎么样  快告诉我012---Okay, how did it go? Tell me everything.
电影非常不错012---Well, the movie was great...
晚餐非常不错  凉爽的纽约夜晚是最棒的012---...dinner was great, and there's nothing like a cool, crisp New York evening.
可惜我没办法好好享受   因为乔安娜好无聊012---Of course, I didn't get to enjoy any of that because Joanna's such a big dull dud.
钱德真的太棒了012---Chandler is fantastic.
什么  天啊  你知道一拍即合吗012---What? Oh, God. You know how people just click?
他来家里接我  我一开门就觉得心动012---Like, he came by to pick me up. I opened the door, and it was just like, "click."
他有跟你说吗  那个嘛…012---Did he tell you? Well...
他真的很好心  他是个好心人吧012---Oh, and he's got such a good heart. Doesn't he have a good heart?
我知道  他真的好体贴012---Oh, I know. And he's so sweet.
他说他会打电话过来  直接帮我接到办公室012---He said he'd call, so put him straight through.
很棒吧  别扫兴012---Isn't this great? Don't spoil it.
来吧  宝贝  别走  求求你012---Come on, baby, don't go. Please?
你觉得呢012---What do you say?
喂012---Hello? Oh!
是你  等一下012---It's you. Just, uh... Just one sec.
我得接这电话012---I am going to take this call.
等一下我希望在舞台上012---When I continue, I hope that there will appear on-stage...
可以看到魔法  在剧场界我们称之为012---...this magical thing that in the theater we call...
入戏012---...committing to the moment.
这家伙跟卡通人物一样012---The guy's like a cartoon.
你到底看上他哪一点012---What do you see in him, anyway?
他非常聪明012---He happens to be brilliant.
比跟你约会的毛衣女好多了012---Which is more than I can say for that sweater you're dating.
我对她的毛衣没兴趣012---Hey, I'm not interested in her sweater.
重要的是毛衣下面的东西012---It's what's underneath her sweater that counts.
而且…012---And besides, since, uh...
你干嘛在乎我跟谁约会012---Since when do you care who I'm going out with?
我不在乎  为什么  你要我在乎吗012---I don't care. Why? Do you want me to care?
你要我希望你在乎吗012---Heh. Do you want me to want you to care?
是吗012---Do you?
什么012---What?
好吧  恐怕我得这么做  从刚刚中断那里开始012---Okay. I'm afraid to say this, but let's pick it up where we left off.
来吧  宝贝  别走  求求你 你觉得呢012---Come on, baby, don't go. Please? What do you say?
我没有留下来的理由012---I've got no reason to stay.
停012---Stop.
停  你们必须停下来012---Stop it. You must stop.
你们都是烂演员012---You are bad actors.
这是出烂戏012---This is a terrible play.
明天早上见012---I'll see you in the morning.
我不敢相信   再过一星期我们就要演出012---I can't believe we go on in a week.
一定不会有问题的012---Hey, it's gonna be all right. Hey.
既然提早收工  你要去画马克杯吗012---So since we're getting off early, do you want to go and paint mugs?
什么012---What?
昨晚我跟你提过的那个地方012---You know, at that place I told you about last night?
对  画马克杯012---Oh, yeah, with the mug-painting. Yeah.
我有注意听012---I was so listening to that. Ha, ha.
你知道吗  今晚我得练习一下012---But, uh, you know what? I think I need to work on my stuff tonight.
好的   好的012---Oh, okay. Okay.
明天见  好的012---I'll see you tomorrow. Okay.
好的  晚安012---Okay. Ha, ha. Night.
你没事吧012---Uh, are you okay?
我想应该没事012---Yeah, I guess.
我们该如何演这场戏012---Like, what are we gonna do about the scene, huh?
我不知道012---I don't know.
好吧012---Well, um...
或许我们该激烈一点012---Maybe if it had more heat.
你什么意思012---Well, how do you mean?
安德丽娜在找理由留下来  对吧012---Well, Adrianne's looking for a reason to stay, right?
维多不能只是吻她   他必须…012---Victor can't just kiss her. He's gotta...
他必须给她一个理由  你知道吗012---He's gotta really give her a reason, you know?
或许他可以跟她舌吻012---Maybe he could slip her the tongue.
或许…012---Or maybe...
或许他可以抓住她   把她抱起来012---Maybe he could grab her and lift her up.
对  安德丽娜用脚缠住他的腰012---Yeah, yeah. Then Adrianne, maybe she could wrap her legs around his waist.
然后她撕开他的衬衫  亲他的胸膛跟肚子012---And then she could rip off his shirt and kiss his chest and his stomach.
他可以用他的牙齿扯开她的洋装012---And then he could use his teeth, his teeth, to undo her dress and...
还要咬她012---And bite her.
这场戏结束时   他可以占有她012---And then right when the scene ends, he could take her...
用他那原始的  兽性的…012---...with this raw, animal...
就像那样吗012---Something like that?
对   差不多跟我想的一样012---Yeah, that's pretty much what I had in mind.
对  对012---Yeah. Yeah.
嗨   嘿012---Hi.  Hey.
现在喝酒太早了012---It's a little early to be drinking.
我终于跟凯特有进展了012---Things, uh, finally happened with Kate.
你在开玩笑  太棒了  太棒了012---Oh. That's great.  You're kidding. That's great.
真的很棒012---Oh, it was so amazing.
跟她做爱后…012---After the lovemaking...
天啊012---Oh, my.
我看着她沉睡   一看就好几个小时012---I just watched her sleep for, like, hours.
她只是在吸气012---Just breathing in... Huh.
吐气012---...and breathing out.
我知道她在做梦  因为她的眼睛是这样的012---And I knew she was dreaming because her eyes kept going like this:
我得说乔安娜误会了  好吗012---I'm telling you, Joanna's got it all wrong, okay?
我只是说"这真的很好玩  我们有空再出来"012---All I said was, "This was fun. Let's do it again sometime.
"我会打电话给你"012---I'll give you a call."
不知道为什么  她以为你会打电话给她012---I wonder why she thinks you're going to call her?
约会后就得那么说012---That's what you say at the end of a date.
你就不能说"幸会  晚安"吗012---You can't just say, "Nice to meet you. Good night"?
当她的面说012---To her face?
那时我们结束约会  我站在那里012---It's the end of the date, I'm standing there...
她等着我说  我会打电话给她012---...she's waiting for me to say I'll call her...
我只是脱口而出  无法控制自己012---...and it just, you know, comes out. I can't help it.
那是一时冲动012---It's a compulsion.
别这样  瑞秋  男人说他会打电话012---Come on, Rach, when a guy says he's gonna call...
不代表他一定会打012---...it doesn't mean he's going to call.
你没遇过那种事吗012---This never happened to you?
他们一向会打电话来012---Well, they always called.
该死012---Bite me.
他有打电话来吗  没有  抱歉012---Did he call? No, sorry.
为什么  他说他会打电话  为什么他没打012---Why? Why? He said he'd call. Why hasn't he called?
或许他害怕聪明  坚强  成功的女强人012---Maybe he's intimidated by really smart, strong, successful women.
苏菲   拜托你别拍我马屁012---Sophie, will you please climb out of my butt.
为什么他不打来  瑞秋  好吧012---Why hasn't he called, Rachel? Why? Okay, okay.
或许他觉得很怪  因为你是我的上司012---Um, well, uh, maybe he feels awkward because you are my boss.
为什么他要觉得怪012---Awkward? Why should he feel awkward?
该觉得怪的人是你  你没有叫他别打电话来吧012---The only person that should feel awkward is you.You didn't tell him not to call me?
如果你不喜欢你朋友跟你老板约会012---If you're uncomfortable with your friend dating someone you work for...
总是有办法可以解决的012---...there are always ways to fix that.
立刻打电话给她012---Call her. Call her now.
我的手被割伤了012---Multiple, so many paper cuts.
为什么他不打电话来   瑞秋012---"Why hasn't he called, Rachel? Why? Why?
我不明白  他说他会打电话的  为什么…012---I don't understand. He said he'd call."
钱德  我得说她抓狂了  她发疯了012---Chandler, I'm telling you, she's flipped out. She's gone crazy.
把电话给我012---Oh. Well, give me the phone, then.
这一点都不好玩  她觉得你没打电话都是我的错012---This isn't funny. She thinks it's my fault you haven't called her.
你必须打电话给她012---You have to call her.
听着  隔了这么久  你不能打电话跟对方说012---Look, you can't call somebody after this long just to say:
"如果你没发现  我不喜欢你"012---"In case you didn't notice, I don't like you."
那么你得再约她出去012---Then you're gonna have to take her out again.
不  她真的很无趣   而且她的眼角012---No. She's really dull, and she gets this...
还留着睫毛膏的污渍012---...gross mascara-goop thing in the corner of her eye.
我不在乎012---I don't care. I don't care.
你得再约她出去  做个了断012---You'll take her out again and end it...
让她知道你们真的没希望012---...and end it in a way that she knows it's actually ended.
我不知道这对你来说有多难   别再跟她说你会打电话给她012---And I don't care how hard it is for you. Do not tell her you'll call her again.
好吧012---All right, fine.
只是一次午餐约会  从现在开始我会自己追女生012---But it's just a lunch date. From now on, I get my own dates.
我不要你再帮我牵红线了012---I don't want you setting me up with anybody again.
没问题012---That's fine.
我只是说说  你知道的  我知道012---That's just a lot of big talk, you know. I know.
摩妮卡012---Mon?
我在浴室012---I'm in the shower.
失火了…012---Aah! Fire. There's a fire. Fire.
嘿  嗨012---Hey.  Hi.
我跟萝伦说过了 跟她提了我们的事012---So I, uh, talked to Lauren. I kind of told her how things were with us.
你跟马歇尔说了吗012---Did you, uh...? Did you talk to Marshall?
说什么012---About what?
你知道的  我们之间的事012---Ha, ha. You know, about what happened with us.
没有012---No.
没理由让他知道012---And there's really no reason why he should find out.
我们不要小题大做  好吗012---So, uh, let's not make a big deal out of it, okay?
你是什么意思012---What are you talking about?
这件事很重要012---It was a big deal.
少来了  你不能跟我说  昨晚的事对你来说毫无意义012---I mean, come on, you can't tell me last night didn't mean something to you.
我也在场  你的演技没那么厉害012---I was there. You're not that good an actress.
听着012---Look.
我只是一时意乱情迷012---Um, I was... I was just caught up in the moment.
就那样012---That's all it was.
乔伊   我很遗憾让你伤心012---Joey, I'm sorry you feel bad...
你没跟  你在乎她多过于她在乎你的女人上床过012---...but haven't you ever slept with a woman where it meant more to her than to you?
没有012---No.
