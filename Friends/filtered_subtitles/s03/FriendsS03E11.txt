乔伊  你怎么变的012---Wow. Joey, how do you do it?
无可奉告012---I can't tell you that. No.
有人在天花板上敲门012---Uh, somebody's at the door on the ceiling.
不  那是我们楼上邻居的噪音012---Heh. No, that's our unbelievably loud upstairs neighbor.
他收起地毯  所有声音一清二楚012---He took up the carpets,and now you can hear everything.
为何不上楼请他放轻脚步012---Well, why don't you go up there and ask him to just step lightly, please?
我试过…五次了吧  但那家伙魅力无法挡…012---I have, like five times,but the guy is so charming...
我上去骂人  结果反而跟他道歉012---...that I go up there to yell,and I end up apologizing to him.
太离谱了012---Oh, that is silly.
我上去叫他小声点012---I'll go up there.I'll tell him to keep it down.
好啊  请便  祝你好运012---All right, be my guest.Good luck.
好吧  好吧…012---All right, all right, all right.
如果你们真想知道我怎么变的  我就告诉你们012---If you really wanna know how I did it,I'll show you.
你们把牌还给我的时候  趁你们不注意…012---When you handed me back the card,what you didn't see was...
我很快的偷看一下  肉眼是看不到的012---...I looked at it so fast,it was invisible to the naked eye.
偷看到了012---I just did it.
又看了一次012---Just did it again.
来  我放慢速度给你们看  准备好了吗012---Here, I'll slow it down so you guys can see it. Ready?
原来如此012---Oh. I got it now. Okay.
听着  我朋友住在楼下  你的动静我们听得一清二楚012---I was at my friend's downstairs......and we hear every single thing that you do.
谢谢012---Oh. Ha, ha. Thank you.

我想辞职  又觉得该坚持下去012---Oh. I wanna quit,but then I think I should stick it out.
我又觉得…012---Then I think...
为什么要做这种  有损尊严的工作012---...why would such a person stay in such a demeaning job...
难道只因为这份工作  和我的兴趣有一点点关系吗012---...just because it's remotely related to the field they're interested in?

他周末会打给我  看是否能安排面试012---...and he's gonna call me this weekend to see if he can get me an interview.
我知道012---Wow. Ha, ha. I know.
这个人无缘无故帮你012---What, so this guy's helping you for no apparent reason?
完全的陌生人012---And he's a total stranger?
对  他叫马克什么的012---Yeah. His name is, um, Mark something.
听起来  马克另有所图012---Ah. Sounds like "Mark Something" wants to have some sex.
什么012---What?
我的意思是  为什么无缘无故给你好处012---I'm just saying, why else would he just swoop in out of nowhere for no reason?
想当好人012---To be nice?
乔伊  男人会没有理由的  对女性示好吗012---Hey, Joey, are men ever nice to strange women for no reason?
不会  除非为了上床  多谢012---No, only for sex. Thank you.
你有和马克提到我吗012---So did you tell Mark Something about me?
不需要  因为我穿着"我爱罗斯"的广告板012---I didn't have to, because I was wearing my "I Heart Ross" sandwich board...
而且摇着铃012---...and ringing my bell.
乔伊  生日快乐012---Joey! Happy birthday!
嘿012---Hey!
好吧  你跟多少女生交往012---Okay, how many of that girl are you seeing?
你想哪儿去  那些是乔伊的姊妹012---How hammered are you? Huh? These are Joey's sisters.
嗨  乔伊的姊妹012---Hi, Joey's sisters.
嗨  你好012---Hey.  Hey. Hey.
你在喝什么012---What are we drinking over here?
伏特加加小红莓汁012---Oh, well, I have a vodka and cranberry juice.
真的012---No kidding?
我干掉我先生后  喝的就是这个012---That's the exact same drink I made myself right after I shot my husband.
好吧  我不知道该怎么跟你说话012---Okay, I don't know how to talk to you.
你在干嘛012---What are you doing?
把我前任女友的快速拨号键删除012---I'm taking my ex-girlfriend off my speed dialer.
不  这是好事012---No, no, no, it's a good thing.
我们要快速拨号干嘛  干嘛赶来赶去的012---Why must we dial so speedily anyway? Why must we rush through life?
为何不珍惜美好的时光  你的胸部真大012---Why can't we savor the precious moments? Those are some huge breasts you have.
嗨  嗨012---Hi. Hi.
我听说了瑞秋今天遇见那个叫马克的家伙了012---Yeah, heh. So, um, I heard about this Mark guy that Rachel met today.
对  不是很棒吗   是啊012---Oh, yeah, isn't that great? Oh, yeah.
很不错  他听起来是个好人012---So, uh, yeah, pretty good.He sounds like a nice, good guy.
的确  他简直太完美了012---Oh, he is. And he is so dreamy.
你知道吗  他走了以后  我还说…012---I mean, you know what?When he left, I actually used the phrase...
哈米娜…012---..."homina, homina, homina."
好极了012---That's excellent.
所以他只是个好人012---So he's just a nice guy.
你真觉得  马克是不求回报的帮你012---You really think this Mark doesn't want anything in exchange for helping you?
也许我该陪他洗个鸳鸯浴012---Well, I assume I'll have to take showers with him.
不过哪份工作不是这样012---But, you know, that's true of any job.
感觉如何012---How you feeling?
我的公寓不见了012---Well, my apartment isn't there anymore...
因为全被我喝光了012---...because I drank it.
你去哪儿  你拆了礼物之后  我们就找不到你了012---Where'd you get to? We lost you after you opened up all the presents.
对  我躲到储藏室  而且不只我一人012---Yeah, I ended up in the storage room,and not alone.
真的012---Really? Aah.
别叫了  别叫了012---No "woo-hooing." No "woo-hooing."
怎么了  出了什么事012---Why, what happened?
我跟乔伊的姐妹瞎搞012---I fooled around with Joey's sister.
那还不是最糟的部分  还有更糟的吗012---Well, that's not the worst part. What is the worst part?
我不记得是哪一个妹妹012---I can't remember which sister.
看到了吗   别说男人有好的012---You see what men do? Don't tell me men are nice.
这就是男人012---This is men.
你疯了吗012---Are you insane?
乔伊会杀了你  他真的会让你死得很惨012---Joey's gonna kill you.He's actually going to kill you dead.
你以为我没想过吗012---Okay. You don't think I thought of that?
你怎会不知道是哪一个  真令人难以置信012---How can you not know which one? I mean, that's unbelievable.
是吉娜吗   吉娜是哪一位012---I mean, was it Gina? Which one is Gina?
褐色蓬蓬头  戴飞机耳环的012---The dark, big hair,with the airplane earrings.
不  那不是吉娜  那是迪娜  你们看  连你们也分不清012---No, no, no, that's not Gina, that's Dina. See? You can't tell which is which either. Blah.
但我们没和她们瞎搞012---We didn't fool around with any of them. Blah. Blah.
薇若妮卡  一定是她  穿红色裙子的012---Veronica. Look, it's gotta be Veronica.The girl in the red skirt.
我确定我有把舌头伸进她嘴里012---I definitely stuck my tongue down her throat.
那个是我012---That was me.
喝了酒以后  我有时会太热情012---Oh. When I've been drinking, sometimes I tend to get overly friendly.
对不起  没关系012---And I'm sorry. That's okay.
不要紧  没关系012---That's all right. That's okay.
可以跟你谈谈吗012---Can I talk to you for a second?
嗨  乔伊  嗨012---Hey, Joey. Hey.
过来012---Come on.
不能在这里谈吗   这里有人作证012---Why can't we talk in here,with witnesses?
我刚和我妹妹通过电话   哪一个012---I just got off the phone with my sister. Uh, which one?
玛莉安琪拉   玛莉安琪拉012---Mary Angela. Mary Angela.
对   这又是哪一个012---Yeah. Now, which one is she again?
问钱德   他和她厮混过012---Ask Chandler.He's the one who fooled around with her.
她告诉我  你说你有可能会爱上她012---She told me you said you could really fall for her.
是真的  还是你利用她忘掉珍妮丝012---Now, is that true, or are you just getting over Janice by groping my sister?
一定是前者012---It's gotta be the first one.
真的吗012---Really?
太好了012---That's great.
你和我妹妹   坐在同一棵树下012---You and my sister, sitting in a tree.
没错  我在树下012---Yep, I'm in a tree.
他打来了吗   马克来电了吗012---Did he call? Did Mark call?
没有  亲爱的  我很抱歉  但周末还没结束012---No, honey, I'm sorry. But the weekend's not over yet.
我的老天  那是菲比吗012---Oh, my God. Is that Phoebe?

不记得了  你想散散步吗012---I don't remember.Do you wanna take a walk?
好啊012---Yeah, I do.
"亲爱的玛莉安琪拉012---"Dear Mary Angela:
你好吗012---Hi, how's it going?
这是我写过最难以下笔的信"012---This is the hardest letter I've ever had to write."
你是怎么搞的  乔伊会怎么反应…012---What the hell's the matter with you? How do you think Joey's gonna react...
当他发现你写信跟她妹妹分手012---...when he finds out you blew off his sister with a letter?
到那时你就告诉他  我搬到法国去了…012---That's the part where you tell him that I moved to France...
但其实我会在古巴012---...when actually I'll be in Cuba.
听着  你得自己来  好吗012---All right, look, look,you've got to do this yourself, okay?
亲自去  至少你已经知道她的名字012---In person. At least you know her name.
只要到他们家找玛莉安琪拉就行了012---You just go to the house and you ask for Mary Angela, okay?
不管到门前的是哪一位…012---When whichever one she is comes to the door...
带她去走走  好好谈谈012---...take her for a walk,you let her down easy.
好012---Okay.
万一是她来开门  而我还要求找她呢012---What if Mary Angela comes to the door and I ask for Mary Angela?
你会在古巴的哪里012---Where in Cuba?
乔伊  你怎么在这里012---Joey, what...? What are you doing here?
等外婆把我的衣服洗好012---Waiting for my grandma to finish my laundry.
那你呢012---What about you?
我来找玛莉安琪拉012---Uh, I'm here to see Mary Angela.
你真是男子汉  进来012---You are so the man. Come on.
注意听012---Now, look, listen. Listen.
你得保持沉着  因为我外婆不晓得你们俩的事012---You gotta be cool, because my grandma doesn't know about you two.
最好别把她惹毛012---You do not wanna tick her off.
她是第六个在墨索里尼尸体上吐痰的人012---She was, like, the sixth person to spit on Mussolini's hanging body.
真的012---Yeah.
玛莉安琪拉呢012---Where's Mary Angela?
就在里面  好012---She's right in there. Okay.
嗨  钱德  嗨  钱德012---Hey, Chandler.
我不敢相信  马克居然没打来  都礼拜天了还没消息012---I can't believe Mark didn't call.It's Sunday night and he didn't call.
真可惜012---Bummer.
对  看看你  简直开心死了012---Yeah, right. Look at you.You're practically giddy.
不  我很遗憾马克没有帮到你012---No, I'm genuinely sorry the Mark thing didn't work out.
听着  瑞秋  我也希望你顺利012---Look, Rach,I want only good things for you.
等等  你为什么不打给他012---Wait a minute.Why don't you just call Mark?
谁规定你只能被动等待012---Who says you have to sit here and wait for him?
你应该主动争取012---You've got to make stuff happen.
是没错  但也不能过分主动012---Yeah, but you don't wanna seem too pushy.
不会的  他把家里电话给她了012---Honey, it's not pushy.He gave her his home number.
什么  家里电话  他家里的电话012---Wha...? He gave you his home number,as in, like, to his home?
对  你不介意吧  因为你希望我顺利012---Yeah. And you don't mind if I call,because you only want good things for me.
没错  这是好事  我是这么说的012---That's right, good things.That is what I said.
哈罗  马克吗  我是瑞秋葛林012---Ahem. Hello, Mark? Hi, it's Rachel Green.
喔  不  你不需要道歉012---Ha, ha. Oh, no. Don't you apologize.
好  我等012---Yeah, I'll hold.
他把我的电话放在公司012---He left my number at work.
本来要去拿  但他得帮侄女做报告012---He was gonna get it, but he was helping his niece with her report on the pioneers.
真会扯012---Aw. That is so made up.
我  我的天  明天  真是…不  太好了012---Yeah. Oh, my God. Tomorrow? That's... No, it's perfect.
天哪  太感谢你了 太好了  再见012---Oh, God. Thank you so much.Great. Bye.
我得到面试机会了012---Oh! I got the interview.
你看吧012---Oh, yay! There you go.
他还约我吃午餐  帮我准备012---He even offered to meet me for lunch and prep me for it.
太棒了  对啊012---Oh, that is amazing. Yeah.
如果我了解马克  我想我是…012---Well, if I know Mark, and I think I do...
他应该就是那么棒  我得想想要穿什么012---...I'd expect nothing less. I gotta figure out what I'm gonna wear.
高领衫加垮裤  看起来比较专业012---High collar and baggy pants say,"I'm a pro."
好吧  回头见  好012---Yeah, right. Okay, I'll see you guys later. Woo-hoo! Okay.
你行的012---You go get them.
我对你不好吗  我有伤害过你吗012---What did I do to you? Did I hurt you in some way?
什么  "你为什么不打给他"012---What? "Why don't you call him?"
多亏你  他现在要帮她准备面试012---Well, thank you very much.Now he's gonna prep her.
帮忙准备面试  下一步就是要开除男友了012---You know, prep her, as in what you do before you surgically remove the boyfriend.
你有病啊012---Are you crazy?
有吗  有吗  我失去理智了吗012---Oh, am I? Am I? Am I out of my mind? Am I losing my senses?
这个完美男要跟我女友吃饭012---This dreamy guy is taking my girlfriend out for a meal.
罗斯  这跟你无关012---Ross, you know, this isn't even about you.
这关系到瑞秋和她的前途012---This is about Rache land something happening for her.
就算你是对的012---Uh-huh.Even if you're right.
他可能另有所图  表示他就能得逞吗012---What if he wants to sleep with her? Does that mean he gets to?
也不是  但… 你不信任她吗012---No, but... I mean, don't you trust her?
没有012---Well, yeah...
那就说服你自己  成熟点012---Then get over yourself. Grow up.
你才成熟点012---You grow up.
这提拉米苏太棒了012---This tiramisu is excellent.
是你做的吗  玛莉安琪拉  不  是我做的012---Did you make it, Mary Angela? No, I did.
真美味012---Well, it's yummy.
那玛莉安琪拉  你喜欢吗012---So, uh, Mary Angela, do you like it?
当然  这是她的最爱012---Of course. It's her favorite.
所以…012---So, um, hmm...
玛莉安琪拉  你还喜欢什么012---Mary Angela,what's your second favorite?
更多的是外婆做的提拉米苏012---More of Grandma's tiramisu.
拜托你…012---Oh, would you just please...
把食谱给我  因为它太好吃了012---...give me your recipe,because this is great.
最棒的012---It's top-notch.
食谱要跟着我上天堂   我也是012---That dies with me. So will I.
想办法到浴室来012---Excuse yourself and go to the bathroom.
我只是眯着眼睛  没有任何意思012---Oh, no, I was just squinting.That doesn't mean anything.
