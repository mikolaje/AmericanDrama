如果你需要钱  现在不是时候  明晚我得请128个人吃晚饭012---Listen, if you want to borrow money, its kind of a bad time. I'm buying dinner for 128 people tomorrow.
不  不是那样的012---No, it's not that.
我不是以你朋友的身分  跟你说话012---now what I'm going to say to you, I’m not saying as your friend. Okay?
我要以摩妮卡大哥的身份跟你谈012---... I'm-I'm saying as it as Monica's older brother.
但你还是我朋友吧  接下来的几分钟不是012---But you're still my friend? Not for a few minutes.
那么现在  你还是我的伴郎吗  不是012---During this time... are you, are you still my best man? Nope.

如果你胆敢让她不快乐012---...if you ever cause her any unhappiness of any kind...
我会把你摁倒在地012---...I will hunt you down...
然后痛扁你012---...and kick your ass.
你怎么啦   我是认真的012---What? I'm-I'm-I'm serious!

我不敢相信  这太不可思议了  你刚刚拿下奥斯卡金像奖012---Wow! I can't believe this. This is incredible. I mean you just won an Oscar.
不  我没有012---No, I didn't.
我知道你有012---I think you did.
我想我落选了  三次012---I think I lost, three times.
饼干  你要  不012---Uh, cookie? Would you...? No.

我们得找到其他士兵  算了吧  他们已经完了012---We have to find the rest of the platoon! Forget the platoon. The platoon is gone!
什么  他们都死了  面对现实吧  东尼012---What? The platoon's dead! Face facts, Tony!
我们该怎么办  我们没有援兵或食物012---So what are we gonna do?!  We have no reinforcements! No-no food!
地下室有食物  有马铃薯跟一些意大利面012---No, we still have food in the basement. I saw potatoes and some dry pasta.
等一下  乔伊  你一直在摸脸012---Hang on a minute!  Joey, you keep touching your face.
有什么问题吗012---Is something wrong?
不  没有012---No. Nope,
我012---I, uh...
我以为这么做会很酷012---I thought it might be kind of a cool character thing.
他是个喜欢摸脸的人012---Y'know? He's uh, he's a face toucher.
我可不那么认为012---I don't think so.
我们从理查  最后一句台词开始  开始012---Let's take it back to Richard's last lines. Action!
虽然我们没有武器  但我们还有食物  地下室有012---We may not have any weapons, but we still have food.
马铃薯  意大利面012---In the basement I saw potatoes, and some dry pasta...

甜心  我们得走了  好012---Honey, we gotta go! Okay.
这个问题真的很难启齿012---Okay. Here's a question you never want to ask:
我爸刚打来电话   问能不能借用你的珍珠项链012---My dad just called and wants to know if he can borrow one of your pearl necklaces?
他有提到  戴哪种款式的吗012---Did he say what kind of neckline he's wearing?
没有012---No.
我只见过他一次  但我猜是低胸V字型的012---Well. I've only met him once but I'm guessing, plunging?
他是那种 "不吓死人不罢休" 的爸爸012---Yeah. He is more of a "if you've got it, flaunt it" kind of father.
我没有那种项链  我去问问瑞秋有没有012---I don't have anything but let me go see if Rachel does.
对  让更多的人知道这件事012---Yes, include more people in this.
你知道明天这个时候  我们就要结婚了吗012---Okay. Do you realize that at this time tomorrow  we'll be getting married?
等等  我明晚好像有约了012---Wait a minute! I have a date tomorrow night.
我不敢相信我们真的办到了  别一副很惊异的样子012---I just, I can't believe we made it. Well you don't have to sound so surprised.
对不起  不过012---I'm sorry, but...
没事  什么012---Nothing. What?
老实说  自从我们订婚后012---Well, honestly? Ever since we got engaged...
我一直在期待发生点什么事  好让你退缩012---...I have been waited for something to, to flip you out.
真的吗  我也是012---Honestly? Me too.
真的吗  对012---Really? Yeah.
我以为会发生什么蠢事  然后我会做012---Y'know I keep thinking that something stupid is gonna come up and I'll...
钱德会做的事012---...go all Chandler.

钱德012---Chandler?
钱德012---Chandler?
嘿  嗨012---Hey. Hi.
摩妮卡在吗  她在熨婚纱  怎么了012---Is Monica here? She's steaming her dress. Why? What's up?
我想钱德走了  什么012---I think Chandler's gone. What?
他留下了这个  "告诉摩妮卡我很抱歉"012---He left that. "Tell Monica I'm sorry."
喔  我的天啊012---Oh, my God.
怎么了012---What's up?
"告诉摩妮卡我很抱歉"012---"Tell Monica I'm sorry."
你自己去告诉她012---Tell her yourself.
喔  我的天啊  钱德走了012---Oh, my God. Chandler just left, though?
或许事情不是我们想的那样  或许他是说012---Yeah but, maybe it's not what we think. Maybe it's:
"告诉摩妮卡我很抱歉   我把最后的牛奶都喝光了"012---"Tell Monica I'm sorry I drank the last of the milk."
或许他写这张字条想告诉她  他改了名字012---Or maybe he was writing to tell her that he's changed his name: y'know?
告诉摩妮卡  我叫 "抱歉"012---Tell Monica, I'm Sorry.
这表示他很惊慌失措逃跑了  不要那么悲观012---I think it means he freaked out and left! Don't be so negative!
天啊  有没有可能 "抱歉"   现在就坐在里面012---Good God, isn't it possible that "Sorry" is sitting in there right now?
菲比  我想罗斯说得对  我们该怎么办012---Okay. Phoebe, I think Ross is right. What are we gonna do?
我得去找他  把他带回来012---Look—Okay, I'm just gonna-- I'm gonna have to go find him and bring him back. Okay?
你们别让摩妮卡发现  好吗012---You make sure Monica does not find out, okay?
好  但是你如果没办法找到他  把他带回来012---Okay? But, if you don't find him and bring him back...
我会把你摁倒在地   然后痛扁你012---...I am gonna hunt you down and kick your ass!
我会  我会找到他的012---I will, I will find him.
乔伊  你能跟我对一下台词吗012---Hey Joey, Can you go through these lines with me?
喔  天啊  他们才帮我补好妆012---Oh, man, they just re-did my makeup.

清晰地发音是一个好演员的特质012---Enunciation is the mark of a good actor.
要清晰地发音  就要喷口水012---And when you enunciate, you spit!

如果你们看到钱德  告诉他我在找他012---Look if you see Chandler, could you just let him know I'm looking for him.
如果你看到丽塔莫雷诺  告诉她我在找她012---And if you see Rita Moreno, let her know I'm looking for her.
