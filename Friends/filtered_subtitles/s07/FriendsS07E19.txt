导演被认为是  下下个马丁史柯西斯012---Oh, and the director is supposed to be the next-next Martin Scorsese.
"下下个"012---The "next-next"?
来自芝加哥的那个家伙被认为是  下一个马丁史柯西斯012---Yeah, there's this guy from Chicago who's supposed to be the next Martin Scorsese, all right?
这个导演在他之后012---But then this guy's right after him.

我的天  只有一个问题012---Oh, my God. There's just one thing.
你对正面全裸有问题吗012---Do you have a problem with full-frontal nudity?
你开玩笑  我租过的电影都有正面全裸镜头012---Are you kidding me? I never rent a movie without it!
哦012---Oh.
好  我再回你电话012---Uh, okay, let me call you back.
怎么回事  电影里需要我全裸012---What's the matter? They want me to be totally naked in the movie!

我祖母会看到的  祖母还得排队才看的到012---My grandmother's gonna see this. Grandma's gonna have to get in line.
老友记  第七季  第19集   罗斯和摩妮卡的表妹012---Friends  S07E19  The One With Ross and Monica's Cousin
婚礼就快到了  你紧张吗012---Hey the Wedding's so close. Are you getting nervous?
紧张  不过我多少也有些盼着它赶紧结束012---Yeah, but a part of me also can't wait 'til it's over.
钱德和我决定  婚礼前不做爱的012---Chandler and I have this pact not to have sex again until the wedding.
"无性条约"  嗯012---A "no sex" pact, huh?
我和全美每位女性  都有一份这个合约012---I actually have one of those going on with every woman in America.
菲比  你能帮我整理客房吗012---Hey Phoebe, will you give me a hand I gotta making up the guest bedroom?
表妹凯西要来和我们住几天012---Hey, Cousin Cassie is coming to stay with us a few days.
凯西  我很久没看到她了012---Cassie? Wow, I haven't seen her for like forever.
她是不是还带着芭比娃娃到处跑012---I wonder if she still carries that a Barbie everywhere she goes.
罗斯  她25岁了  所以呢  我还是012---Ross, she's 25 years old. So what! I still have--
哦  你大概是对的012---No you're probably right.
嘿  嘿012---Hi. Hey.
菲比  我能在这儿跟你谈点事吗012---Pheebs, can I talk to you over here for a second?

就算是吧  别破坏气氛  至少假装不知道啊012---Ha, Well okay, Well don't ruin it! Just play along, at least.
好吧  对不起012---Okay. Sorry. Okay.
天啊  我们还要替她办告别单身女子派对012---Oh, my God. We have to throw her a shower?
嘿  那部影片你怎么决定的012---Hey! What'd you decide to do about the movie?
我不知道012---I don't know.
看起来不像个色情片  这是一个严肃  正统的电影  你知道012---It's not like it's porn. This is a serious, legitimate movie. Y'know?
这个故事里的裸戏很重要012---And the udity's really important to the story.
你也是这么说色情电影的012---That's what you say about porn.
你说的对   也许我都不必回复他们012---You're right. Maybe I shouldn't even go on the callback.
不  你应该去  很多大明星都演过裸戏012---No, No you should. A lot of major actors do nude scenes.
我是说这是个当电影明星的机会  别错过啊012---I mean the chance to star in a movie? Come on!
是真的  我只有一场裸戏  再说故事听起来真的很不错012---Well that's true. And I'm only naked in one scene. Plus it sounds really great.
我的角色是个天主教徒   和一位犹太女孩恋爱了012---My character's Catholic. He falls in love with a Jewish girl.
我们一起私奔  却陷在了大雨中012---Who run away together and they get caught in this big rainstorm.
于是我们躲进谷仓  脱掉彼此的衣服  拥抱在一起012---So we go into this barn, undress each other and hold each other.
真的很甜蜜而温柔012---It's really sweet and tender.
那是啊  每个人都看到你那玩意了012---Plus, everyone is gonna see your thing.
我们什么时候能开这个告别单身女子派对啊012---Well when can we have this shower?
她有这么多事要做  我们只有两个选择012---She has so much going on, we have only two options.
星期五  那只剩两天了012---We have Friday. Well that's only two days away.
另外一个选择呢  昨天012---What is the other option? Yesterday.
如果我们昨天就办了  问题解决了012---Well, if we make it yesterday, woo-hoo, we're done.
天啊  菲比  这不可能  我们不可能在星期五办012---Oh my God Phoebe, this is impossible! We can't do this by Friday.
要找地点  邀请客人  买好食物012---We have to find a place, We have to invite people! get food.
太多事要做  不可能  办不到012---There's just too much to do. It's impossible! We cannot do it!
办不到  瑞秋  镇静下来012---We cannot do it! Rachel, Calm down!
好  抱歉  你是对的  你是对的  抱歉012---Okay. I'm sorry, you're right. you're right. I'm sorry.
镇静下来  女人012---Just calm down, woman!
菲比  我已经  已经镇静下来了012---Phoebe, I already. I already did.
那好  那我需要镇静012---Oh okay. All right, then I need to calm down a little.
我认为如果组织得当  我们是能办成的012---Okay. Okay. I think we can do this if we just get organized. All right?
有两天来计划这个派对012---Uh-huh. We have two days to plan this party.
做决定要快012---We just need to make fast decisions. Mm-hm.
好  要在哪里办012---Okay? All right, where will we have it?
在这里  什么时间  4点整  食物012---Um, here. What time? Four o'clock. Food?
小三明治和茶  好极了  好像摩妮卡012---Finger sandwiches and tea. Ooh, great. Very Monica.
还有辣椒  这就太过头了012---And chili. Ah, you went one too far.
花还是气球  两个都要012---Uh, flowers or balloons? Both.
我们要付钱的  都不要012---We're paying for this. Neither.
主题选什么呢  "肌肤之爱"012---Um, what should we do for the theme? "Lusts of the Flesh."
什么  我不知道  牛仔主题怎么样012---What? I don't know. Cowboy theme?
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
我很高兴我们决定婚礼前不上床012---I'm really glad we decided not to sleep together before the wedding.
我也是012---Oh, boy. Me too.
我在想  如果我们大吵一架012---You know, I was thinking, if we had a big fight--
分手几个小时012---Mm-hm. ...and, uh, we broke up for a few hours.
技术上来说  我们就可以上床了012---Yeah. Technically, we could have sex again.
你说呢  专横独裁的家伙012---What do you think, bossy and domineering?
婚礼取消了  肥胖幼稚的家伙012---The Wedding's off, sloppy and immature.
我也正有此意  走吧012---That's me. Come on. Okay.
等等  我们不能这么做  凯西在客房  我们要一起出去吃中餐012---Okay. But wait. we can't. My Cousin Cassie is in the guest room. We're supposed to have lunch.
甩掉她  执拗尖锐的人012---Well get rid of her, obsessive and shrill.
尖锐  婚礼照常012---Shrill? The wedding is back on.
我听到有人讲话  你一定是钱德012---I thought I heard voices. You must be Chandler.
嗨  很高兴认识你  很高兴认识你012---Hi. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you too.
你准备好要走了吗   好了012---So, are you ready to go? Yeah.
钱德  我跟你一起去012---Chandler? I'll be right with you.
凯西必须去住你家  为什么012---Cassie needs to stay at your place. What-Why?
因为这位 "变态人"   一直盯着她看012---Because "Pervie Perverson" over here can't stop staring at her.
什么  钱德  她是我们的表妹012---What?! Chandler, she's our cousin!
我没有盯着她看  我只是在专心倾听012---I wasn't staring at her. Okay? I was just listening intently.
做一位好的聊天者  看着我012---It's called being a good conversationalist. Watch.
说话012---Say something.
你看着南面8英寸以外的地方012---You were staring about eight inches south of there.
好吧  她可以来我家住012---Fine. She can stay at my place.
顺便问下  凯西现在长成什么样子了012---By the way, what-what does Cassie even look like now?
就像玛丽莲阿姨012---She looks exactly like Aunt Marilyn. Huh.
玛丽莲阿姨会来参加婚礼吗012---So this Aunt Marilyn, is she coming to the wedding?
别惹我发火012---Wafer-thin ice.
嘿  我回来了012---Hey, I'm back.
嗨  乔伊012---Hi, Joey.
那我要不要再演一遍那场戏啊012---Uh, so, will I be reading the same scene again?
其实  我们本来要打电话给你  你今天不用来这儿012---Actually, I tried to call you. You didn't need to come today.
太好了012---Oh, great.
我会是这个角色的最佳人选  不过随你便012---Y'know I'd have been perfect for this part. but whatever!
谢谢你们做了个错误的决定  这会毁了你们的电影  再见012---Y'know, thanks for making a bad decision and ruined your movie. Good day!
等等  乔伊  你不需要来这儿  因为导演昨天看了你的带子非常喜欢012---Wait Joey! You didn't need to come down because the director saw your tape from yesterday and loved it.
下台鞠躬012---And scene.
呀  很好玩吧012---Huh? Wasn't that fun?
即席表演012---We did a little improv there. Yeah!
你刚才在说012---So, you-You were saying?
导演们认为你很适合  明天想见你012---Well, the director thinks you're really right for the part and wants to meet you tomorrow.
哇  当然  太好了012---Wow. Sure. That's great.
你的经纪人说你对裸戏没问题012---Oh and your agent said you're okay with the nudity.
对  没错  只要是看着很有格调012---Yeah! Yeah, sure. just long as it's handled tastefully.
而且谷仓里不要太冷就行012---And that barn is not too cold.
好极了  还有一件事012---Terrific. Well, uh, there's one more thing.
导演希望电影里  每一样东西都看上去真实可信012---Uh... Uh, it's really important to the director that everything in this movie is authentic.
所以你和莎拉的性爱场面012---Yeah and so in your love scene with Sarah...
她说她从没见过  非犹太人的裸体男子012---...she talks about how she's never seen a naked man who wasn't Jewish.
所以012---So...
所以怎样012---So, what?
导演坚持演出这个角色的人012---So, uh, well, the director is insisting that whoever play that part...
必须是从解剖学角度上来看012---...be authentically, uh, anatomically...
不是个犹太人  你知道我在说什么012---...not Jewish. You know what I'm saying?
知道012---Yes!
不知道  你说什么012---No. What?
在那时的意大利  一个天主教移民应该没有012---An Italian Catholic immigrant at this time would not be...
割包皮012---Bar mitzvah-ed?
那么说要得到这个角色  你就不能割过那个  对012---So to get this part you can't be-Nope.
可你其实割了  对012---But you are? Yep.
但你告诉他们  你没有割过  对012---But you told them you weren't? That's right.
哇啊  哇啊012---Wow. Wow.
那这就全完了  没有什么可努力的余地了012---And it's definitely all gone? There's nothing there to work with?
你在想什么  我不知道  我想得到这个角色012---What were you thinking? I don't know. I really want this part.
而且他们说不管试镜时问什么  都回答是012---And they tell you no matter what you get asked at an audition you say yes.
如果要你骑马  你就说会骑012---Like if-if they want you to ride a horse, you tell 'em you can
回头再去学012---And just figure out how to do it later.
乔伊  这和学会骑马不一样  这就像是学习如何012---Joey! This is not like learning to ride a horse. This is like learning to...
让衣服自己长出衣领来012---...grow a turtleneck.
我知道  我知道  行了吗  明天我去见导演时012---I know, I know! okay? And apparently tomorrow, when I go in to meet the director...
必须脱掉衣服  让他们检查我的身子012---...I have to take off my clothes so  that they can see what my body looks like.
我的天  那你怎么办啊012---Oh, my God. What are you gonna do?
看来我必须打给我的经纪人  告诉她我没法演012---I just have to call my agent and tell her I can't do the part.
除非012---Unless...
除非什么012---Unless what?
这听起来可能有些疯狂  不过我们也许可以做点012---Well, this may sound crazy, but there may be something we could...
造型012---...fashion.
像什么  我还没想好  不过  嗯012---Like what? Well, I'm not sure yet, but, um...
我突然有个念头  我在想012---...off the top of my head, I'm thinking...
用双面胶和某一些午餐肉来做012---...double-sided tape and some sort of luncheon meat.
嘿  我有个派对主题的好点子了012---Hey! I've got a great idea for party favors for the shower. Okay,
我们找点桃木盒子  刻上每个人的名字012---we get some uh mahogany boxes and carve everyone's names in them.
在里面放着每个人的出生石012---and inside is everyone's individual birth stone.
好  好012---Okay. Okay.
好吧  那你负责这个012---All right, you take care of that. Okay.
还有  派对就在明天  我们还没有宾客名单012---And meanwhile, the party's tomorrow and we still don't have a guest list.
好  好吧  我们知道谁会来  有我  你要来吗012---Okay. Okay! Well okay, Who do we know that's coming? Me. Are you?
嘿  怎么样啊012---Hey. Hey, what's up Mon?
我在替乔伊弄点东西  可以搜一下你的冰箱吗012---Well uh, I'm trying to making something for Joey. Do you mind if I raid your fridge?
请便012---Have at it.
好  火鸡肉  没用012---Okay. All right. Turkey? Mm, that won't work.
起司  没用012---Cheese? That won't work.
橄榄面包  希望这没用012---Olive loaf? I hope that won't work.
你在替他做三明治吗012---Are you making him a sandwich?
不  像是鸡肉卷012---No, it's, um, more like a wrap.
好  我要走了012---Okay, so, um, I'm gonna go, guys.
你们可以继续讨论  要送我什么礼物012---I guess you can get back to deciding on what to get me for a present!
我们要送她礼物012---We have to get her a present?
好吧  看我拿到什么012---Okay, but look. Look at what I got.
她的通讯录  我们有宾客名单了012---It's her address book. We have a guest list.
天啊  你好厉害  你从她皮包里拿的012---Oh my God you're amazing. Did you pull that out of her purse?
嗯  还有一点派对的启动资金012---Uh-huh. And a little seed money for the party.
凯西012---Cassie?
嘿  罗斯  嘿012---Hey, Ross. Hi. ha, ha.
好久不见012---It's been so long!
上一次我看到你时012---Last time I saw you...
你正忙着收帐篷好去看绝地武士012---...you were setting up your tent in line to see Return of the Jedi.
对  没错012---Oh, Oh, uh, that's right.
这么说你那天看见我了  我还以为你没看见呢012---So-so you did see me that day. Because it seemed like you didn't.
对不起  没关系  来来  请进012---Yeah, sorry about that. It's okay. Come, come on in.
谢谢你让我住在这儿  我是说摩妮卡那儿也不错012---Thanks for letting me stay here. I mean Monica's place was nice.
只是她的未婚夫老是盯着我看012---But her fiancee sure stares a lot.
我的天  你学钱德学得真像012---Oh, my God! You do a great Chandler!
我很会模仿别人表情的012---Uh-huh. Yeah, I have a knack for impressions.
也许等我们熟一点  你也可以学我012---Well, maybe after we get re-acquainted, uh, you could do me.
好  不012---Yeah. No!
凯西  你的 你的好吃吗012---Cassie, how you--? How you doing on that...
热狗012---hot dog.

我记得我们最后一次见面  是我们父母一起租下那栋海滨别墅012---I guess the last time we really hung out was when our parents rented that beach house together.
哦  对  没错  记得那时012---Oh, right, right. Ooh, remember the time...
我把你按倒在地   搔你痒把你咯吱哭了012---...l, uh, pinned you down and tickled you until you cried?
我们现在大了  不能那么做了012---We're probably too old to do that now.
我一直都记得那个夏天  我就是那时长了这些雀斑的012---I'll always remember that summer. because it's when I got all of these freckles.
嗯哼  还有  我也一直都记得那个夏天012---Uh-huh! Uh-huh! And-And I'll always remember that summer...
因为那时我才意识到我们是亲戚012---...because that's when I realized that we are related.
你长那么大才明白过来啊012---It took you that long to figure it out, huh?
我是有点反应慢了012---Well I'm, I'm a little slow.
就像我们的孩子也可能会这样子012---Just as our children would be.

我也做了一个有毛的  不过那是给我自己的012---I also did a little something in fur, but, uh, that's really just for me.
