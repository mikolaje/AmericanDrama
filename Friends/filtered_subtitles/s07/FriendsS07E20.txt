嘿  我们这些人里  你们认为下一个结婚的会是谁012---Hey, out of all of us, who do you think will get married next?
大概是摩妮卡和钱德012---Probably Monica and Chandler.
嘿  能卖我一包纽宝牌淡烟吗012---Hi, could I have a pack of Newport Lights? please?
我们没有卖烟  不过街对面的报摊上有卖012---Oh, urn, uh, we don't sell cigarettes, but they have them at the newsstand across the street.
那太好了  谢谢012---That'd be great. Thanks.
我的天012---Oh, my God.

我最后一次听说你   是说你要结婚了012---So last I heard you were gonna get married.
可怜的瑞瑞012---Poor Ray-Ray.
不  不  这很好  我其实一切都挺好的012---Oh, no, no. it's-It's good. It's all good.
我现在替罗夫罗兰工作  别说了012---I actually work at Ralph Lauren. Shut up!

别说了012---Shut up.

你在做房地产  不  那是旧名片012---Oh, you're in real estate? Oh, no, heh, that's an old card.
我想离开这个行业去做些012---Um, I wanted to get out of that and-and do something where I can really...
可以帮助别人和改变世界的工作012---...help people and make a difference.
现在你做什么012---Wow. What do you do now?

闭嘴  那是我大学的朋友梅莉莎012---Shut up that was my friend, Melissa, from college.
她看起来非常非常好玩012---She seems really, really fun!
她真的很甜  我们曾经很亲密012---She's actually very sweet, and we used to be very close.
等一下  她不是那个和你012---Wait a minute. she isn't...She's not the one who you...?
和你什么  和你什么012---Who you what? Who you what?
是  哇012---Yes. Wow!
哇  喔什么  喔什么  和你什么012---Wow-Wow, what? Wow what?! Who you what?
没什么大不了012---Oh, it's not a big deal.
她们曾经是情人012---They were lovers.
什么  什么012---What? What?
不  我们不是情人  那又没什么012---No, we weren't. It was nothing.
大四的时候  有一天晚上  我们去参加舞会012---It was one night, senior year, and we went to a party...
喝了很多桑格利亚调酒  你知道  最后012---...had a lot of sangria, and you know, ended up...
我们接吻了012---...kissing for a bit.
我有两任老婆是同性恋了012---So that's two of my wives.
老友记  第七季  第20集  同性之吻012---Friends  S07E20  The One With Rachel's Big Kiss
好  乐队在这儿  酒吧在这儿012---Okay, so this is where the band is. And this is where the bar is.
这些大头针上都有人名  瑞秋  你在这里012---And all these pins have people's names on them. And Rach, here you are.
哦  哇012---Oh, wow!
为什么不给我一杯曼哈顿  把我挪到这里012---Why don't we just take me and put me with a Manhattan in my hand...
和可爱的男酒保聊天012---...talking to the cute bartender.
这些大头针不是用来玩的  对吧012---These pins aren't for playing, are they?
红的是我的客人  蓝色的是你的012---Okay, the red ones are my guests, and the blue ones are yours.
真可怜  我只有10个客人012---This is so sad. I mean, I only have like 10 pins.
钱德  轻松一点  这又不是比赛012---Heh, Chandler, relax. It's not a contest.
不是实力相当的比赛012---Certainly not a close one.
大家好  嘿012---Hello. Hey.
嘿  瑞秋012---Hey, Rash.
别再想了012---Stop picturing it!
我想就这样吧  座位都确定了  这就是我们的婚礼012---Okay, I think that's it. The seating chart is done. This is our wedding.
他们看上去都很开心  对吧012---Wow. They all look like they're having fun  don't they?
我爸妈坐哪里012---Hey, so where are my parents gonna be?
看看啊  如果这是婚礼大厅012---Let's see, well, if this is the wedding hall, then, um...
你父母会在皇后区的家里012---...your parents would be over here at home in Queens.
什么  他们没有被邀请  哦不  这太可怕了  他们会发疯的012---What they're not invited? Oh, no, that's terrible! they're gonna be crushed!
为什么他们觉得会被邀请012---Why would they think they're invited?
你问倒我了  我不012---You got me. I don't...
乔伊   抱歉  我以为父母都会来012---Joey! Well, I'm sorry. Look, I thought parents were coming.
你的父母会来  钱德的父母也会来012---Y'know? Your parents are coming. Chandler's parents are coming.
罗斯的父母也会来012---Ross's parents are coming.
罗斯的父母就是我的父母012---Ross's parents are my parents.
看么  父母们都会来012---Well-well, see, parents are coming.
我想我们应该邀请他们  算了吧  你就想多增加几根蓝色大头针012---Y'know I think we should invite them. Oh please, you just want more blue pins.
这实在太悲惨了012---Well, this is just sad.
好吧  好吧  也许我重新安排一下位置可以让他们进来012---All right. all right. Maybe I can fit them in if I just do some rearranging.
不过  瑞秋可能真的要坐在吧台了012---But uh, Rachel may actually have to sit at the bar.
没有问题012---That is not a problem.
也许你可以叫杯桑格利亚调酒  去你的012---Maybe you'll order a little sangria. Oh, get out of here!
我们所有的晚礼服都在这儿  随便你喜欢哪一件  都可以便宜给你012---So now, these are all the tuxedos that we make and if there's anything that you like, we can make you a deal.
任选一件  但这三件是摩妮卡先核准的012---Anything at all. But these are the three that Monica pre-approved.
谢谢你帮我挑晚礼服  瑞秋012---Uh, well, thanks a lot for hooking me up Rach.
我希望你作为我的客人出席婚礼012---And I want you to know that I want you to attend our wedding as my guest.
我是摩妮卡的伴娘012---I'm Monica's maid of honor.
好吧  别想把我钉在你的蓝色大头针上012---Okay, don't try to blue-pin me.
那这些呢  怎么样  看起来不错  是不错啊012---Well, what's the deal with these? These-these look nice. Oh they are nice.
这些都是帮名人量身打造的  他们穿过后就送回来这儿012---We-we custom-make tuxedos for celebrities and then when they're done with them they just send 'em back.
你是指像颁奖典礼之后  有些是012---You mean, like, for award shows? Some of them.
这都上过红地毯  被人叫着012---You mean these tuxes have been down the red carpet with people yelling, uh...
"你是穿谁的  你看来棒极了"012---..."Who are you wearing? You look fabulous!"
亲爱的  我建议你  多看一点ESPN体育频道012---Honey, might I suggest watching a little more ESPN...
少看一点八卦娱乐节目012---...and a little less E!.
谁穿过这些012---Okay. Who wore those?
这是汤姆布罗考(NBC新闻主播)穿过的  不错嘛012---Umm, well, let's see uh, this one's Tom Brokaw. Not bad.
这是保罗奥尼尔(美财政部长)穿过的012---This one is, uh, Paul O'Neil.
他是谁012---Who's that?
他是"洋基队"的球员  真的  多看看ESPN012---He plays for the Yankees. Seriously, ESPN.
就算有的时候  开着频道当背景听也好啊012---Just once in a while. Have it on in the background.
这件是皮尔斯布鲁斯南穿过的012---Ooh, this one was Pierce Brosnan.
皮尔斯布鲁斯南  嗯012---Pierce Brosnan? Uh-huh.
真的吗  真的啊012---Are you serious? Yeah.
007012---O07?
这是詹姆斯邦德的晚礼服  我一定要穿詹姆斯邦德的晚礼服结婚012---This is James Bond's tux? Oh, I have to get married in James Bond's tux.
是很酷的礼服012---Ha, ha. It's a pretty cool tux.
不只如此  我会是英格兰最强大的武器012---Ah, Oh, it's not just that. I would be England's most powerful weapon.
女王陛下的秘密特务  环游世界的负心人012---A jet-setting heartbreaker on Her Majesty's secret service.
有杀人执照  什么都不怕的男人012---A man who fears no one, with a license to kill.
摩妮卡会不会让我穿这件呢012---Would Monica let me wear this?
我们应该学真正的玩法012---We should really learn how to play the real way.
我喜欢我们的玩法012---I like our way.
将军012---Chess!
走的好  是啊012---Nice move. Yeah.
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
乔伊  我替罗斯和钱德挑选好了婚礼上用的晚礼服  你需要吗012---So Joey I just hooked Ross and Chandler up with some tuxedos for the wedding, Do you need one?
不  我主持婚礼  我不穿晚礼服012---No, I'm performing the ceremony. I'm not wearing a tux.
那你打算穿什么  五彩长袍012---Well, what are you gonna wear? Multi-colored robes.
也许戴一顶帽子012---Ooh, and maybe a hat.
摩妮卡知道吗  我想她不知道012---Huh. Does Monica know about this? I don't think so.
你告诉她时我能在场吗012---Can I please be there when you tell her?
瑞秋等等  今晚要不要去看电影012---Hey, Rach wait! you want to go to a movie tonight?
没办法  我去不了  我要和梅莉莎吃饭012---Oh, y'know what? I can't. I have to have dinner with that Melissa girl.
我能跟你去吗012---Can I come?
我不会出声  你只会听见我摄影机的声音012---I won't even talk! You'll just hear the noise from my video camera.
什么  怎么回事  让我来告诉她吗  能让我来告诉她吗012---What? What's going on? Oh good! Can I tell her? Can I tell her?!
你要听真实发生的事  还是听乔伊的下流版本012---Do you want to hear what actually happened or Joey's lewd version?
乔伊的  好012---Joey's. Okay.
喂  少来012---Okay, come on.
大学时我有一个朋友012---I had this friend from college...
我犯了一个愚蠢的错误  我告诉乔伊有一次012---...and I made the mistake of telling Joey that one time...
她和我接吻了012---...she and I, you know, kissed a little bit.
对啊  我相信这当然发生了012---Yeah, I'm sure that happened.
真的啊  当然012---It did. Sure.
嘿  那就真的发生了012---Hey, heh. It happened.
是大四那年  有一次开夏威夷主题派对舞会012---Yeah, it was senior year in college. It was after the Sigma Chi luau...
我和梅莉莎喝得大醉012---...and Melissa and I got very drunk.
结果我们两个接吻了  足足有好几分钟呢012---And we ended up kissing. For several minutes.
也就是在脸颊上轻轻地亲了一下012---Which means she had a couple spritzers and a peck on the cheek.
你为什么要剥夺我的幻想呢012---Why are you taking this away from me? Ugh.
为什么你就不相信呢012---Yeah, why is it so hard for you to believe?
好吧  我不知道你是同性恋012---Okay. I just I didn't know that you were a lesbian.
我不是说我是同性恋  我只是说那件事发生了012---I'm not saying that I'm a lesbian. I'm just saying that this happened.
我只是觉得很狂野  而你是这么地012---Okay, it just seems pretty wild. And you're-You know, so...
乖宝宝012---...vanilla.
乖宝宝  我不是乖宝宝  我会做很多疯狂的事012---Vanilla? I'm not vanilla. I've done lots of crazy things.
我还喝醉了  在拉斯维加斯还结了婚012---I mean, I got drunk and married in Vegas.
和罗斯012---To Ross.
这样吧  如果你还不相信012---All right, y'know what? If you don't want to believe me  about this...
今晚和我一起去吃饭  她会告诉你012---...why don't you just come with me to dinner tonight and she'll tell you.
好吧  反正我也想像不出来012---Okay. All right! Yeah! Because I can't picture it.
你该到我脑子里来看看012---Oh-ho, you should get inside my head.
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
猜猜我为你的婚礼弄到什么了012---Guess what I got for your wedding?
一个脑袋上有衣架的畸形女友012---A freakishly thin date with a hanger for a head?
不是  瑞秋帮我找一件晚礼服  可不是随随便便的一件012---No. Rachel hooked me up with a tux. But not just any tux.
是蝙蝠侠的晚礼服012---Batman's tux!
什么  没错012---What? That's right.
这件晚礼服是给瓦尔基尔默在电影中用的  让他穿在票房冠军电影里012---Made expressly for Val Kilmer, and worn by him in the hit film...
就是他演的那部蝙蝠侠012---...that Batman film he was in.
你不能穿那件  我穿了名人的晚礼服012---You can't wear that. I'm wearing the famous tux.
詹姆士庞德的晚礼服    那又怎样012---James Bond's tux. So?
那又怎样  如果你穿那件  会让我显得不那么特别012---So—If you wear that, you'll make mine less special.
你需要什么来让那天特别一点吗012---Well, you need something to to make this day special?
喂  你有了最特别的一样012---Hello! You have the most special thing of all.
你娶了你最爱的女人012---You are marrying the woman you love.
拜托  不要抢走我的锋头嘛  拜托拜托012---Please, don't take away my cool thing. Please?! Pretty please?
"拜托拜托"   这可不象007012---"Pretty please?" Not very, uh, 007.
这是我的婚礼  如果是你结婚  我不会做任何让你生气的事012---Look, it's my wedding day okay? If you were getting married, I'd never do anything to upset you.
我结婚的时候  你和我妹妹上床  那就很007012---When I got married you slept with my sister. That was pretty 007.
嘿  嘿  好  你来了012---Hey. Hey. Okay, good. You're here.
好  我想出办法来了012---All right, I figured it out.
我把这两桌的8个人  加上你父母012---I'm gonna take 2 tables of 8, I'm gonna add your parents...
变成3桌6个人012---...and I'm gonna turn them into 3 tables of 6. Okay?
我已经通知了办酒席的人  要多做两份  都弄好了012---And I called the caterer. I added two extra meals, We are good to go!
很好  不过他们不来了012---Yeah. They're not coming.
什么012---What?
不知道为什么  他们觉得你是因为我才邀请他们的012---Somehow they got the idea that you only invited them because of me.
他们有点觉得自己是多余的012---They...feel a little unwanted.
真糟糕  确实那样的  不过还是很糟糕012---Oh that's too bad. It's true. But too bad.
要不这样摩妮卡  你可以打电话给我妈  乔伊012---Look Mon, if you could just call my mom. Oh, Joey.
拜托  让她知道是你真心希望他们去012---Come on. Look just-just tell—let her know that you really want them there.
别忘了  这可是每年都给你送很多很多千层面的女人啊012---Let's not forget this is a woman who that has sent you many lasagnas over the years.
不  她哪有012---No, she hasn't.
有些没送到你手里也不是她的错啊012---Is it her fault that some of them didn't make it to you?
那我该怎么说呢012---Well, what am I gonna say?
告诉她请帖搞乱了  不  怪邮局好了012---Just uh, Just tell them you mixed up invitations. No, no, no, blame it on the post office.
他们最恨邮局  还有爱尔兰人012---They hate the post office. And the Irish.
不过我想你不能怪到他们头上012---But I don't think you could blame it on them.
喂  你好  崔比亚尼太太吗  我是摩妮卡盖勒012---Hello? Yeah, hi. Uh, Mrs. Tribbiani? Hi, this is Monica Geller.
我想告诉你  钱德跟我希望你们能来参加婚礼012---I'm just calling to say that Chandler and I uh, really hope you can make the wedding.
我们很多请帖都没寄到012---Yeah, apparently a bunch of invitations that we sent weren't delivered.
我猜又是可恶的邮局搞砸的012---Um, I guess there was some screw-up at the damn post office.
就是嘛012---Tell me about it.
什么美国邮局  更像是美国遗失局012---Yeah, yeah, the U.S. Post Office? No. More like U.S. Lost Office.
难道他们都是爱尔兰人吗012---What are they, Irish?
总之呢  他叫艾伦  我们在一起三年了012---Anyway, his name's Allen. And we've been going out for three years.
他是我做宴会规划的第一位客户012---He was my first client when I became a party planner.
那时他正要为他当时的女朋友  规划一场宴会012---He was actually planning a party for his girlfriend at the time.
结果就变成这样012---Oh, well. No.
他是雪城大学兄弟会的  哦  太棒了012---Ah. He was Theta Beta Pi at Syracuse. Oh! Oh, that's great.
菲比  你参加过女生联谊会吗  当然012---Phoebe, were you ever in a sorority? Of course.
我是大腿卫生棉条的成员012---Yes. I was a, um, Thigh Mega Tampon.
什么012---What one?
我们规模也很大  但后来他们把我们解散了012---Yeah, Y'know, we were really huge too. But then they had to shut us down...
因为瑞吉娜佛兰姬基死于酒精中毒012---...when Regina Phalangie died of alcohol poisoning.
真是糟糕   一颗老鼠屎就毁了一锅粥012---Oh, isn't it a shame when one girl ruins it for the whole bunch?
不管了012---Anyway...
醉话说的太多了   我告诉菲比012---Speaking of drinking too much, I was, uh, telling Phoebe...
姐妹会开夏威夷派对  很疯的那晚  我们亲吻的事012---...about that one crazy night after the Sigma Chi luau where you and I uh, we made out.
什么012---What?
记得嘛  我们穿着土著裙子  还有椰子壳比基尼上衣012---Remember we-Come on, we had sarongs on and we had coconut bikini tops.
之后我们回到家  继续在那儿疯癫012---We went back to the house and got really silly...
然后我们接吻了012---...and we made out.
瑞瑞  我不知道你在说什么012---Wow, Ray-Ray, I have no idea what you're talking about.
真的吗012---Really?
罗斯是蝙蝠侠012---Ross is Batman.
他还真会掩护秘密身分  瞒了这么久012---Well, he did manage to keep his identity secret for a long time.
瑞秋替罗斯弄到  瓦尔基尔默在蝙蝠侠里穿的晚礼服012---Rachel got Ross the tuxedo that Val Kilmer wore in Batman.
蝙蝠侠可比詹姆士庞德酷多了012---Batman is so much cooler than James Bond.
你在说什么啊  007有好多新式武器   蝙蝠侠有多功能腰带012---What are you talking about?!  007 has all those gadgets. Batman has a utility belt.
007有特制的汽车   蝙蝠侠有蝙蝠车012---007 has a fancy car. Batman has the Batmobile.
007有美女相伴  蝙蝠侠只有罗宾012---007 gets all the ladies. Heh. Batman has Robin.
我们有ESPN台  对吧012---We get ESPN, right?
不如你去穿上007晚礼服   我来给你调一杯马丁尼酒012---How about you go put on your 007 tuxedo, and I'll make you a nice martini?
我不喜欢  马丁尼012---Actually I don't like martinis.
那有搞笑吸管的摇摇饮料呢  好的012---A Yoo-Hoo with a funny straw? Ooh, yum.
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
请帖上写晚上6点012---Listen, I know the invitation says 6:00...
那是指6点入席  还是6点开始表演012---...but does that mean that you want people to get there at 6, or the show is gonna start right at 6?
表演012---The show?
对  婚礼  知道了012---Right, Right. the wedding. Gotcha.
不过婚礼能不能晚一点开始  我是说  婚礼晚一点进行  行吗012---But I mean, it's gonna start a little late right? I mean, weddings start late. Right?
你有参加过我规划的婚礼吗012---Have you ever been to one of my weddings?
你看  事情是这样的  那天也是我外甥女的洗礼日012---Ah, Well look, the thing is it's the same day as my niece's christening...
我真的希望我父母能准时出席来看我012---...and I really want my parents to be there in time to see me.
因为我的角色是在开始部分  演出的其他部分没我什么事012---'Cause My part's just in the beginning. I'm not even in the rest of the show-Wedding.
婚礼6点开始012---The wedding starts at 6.
好  好  我完全明白了012---Okay. Okay, I totally hear you.
这样如何  我可以表演个小节目到他们来012---Ooh! How about this? I vamp a little till they get there.
你要 "表演"012---Heh. You'll "vamp"?
对啊  就像给观众热热身  问问他们从哪儿来012---Yeah, yeah, y'know, like warm up the crowd. Ask 'em where they're from.
因为有乔伊崔比亚尼在  就像同时拥有了一个牧师和一个演员012---'Cause In Joey Tribbiani, you get a minister and you get an entertainer.
我是一位 "表演牧师"012---I'm a "mini-stainer."
不会比这更好的了  不会比这更棒的012---There's no one better. There's no one greater.
你怎么会不记得我们接吻的事012---How can you not remember us kissing?
不知道  很多从没发生过的事我不记得了012---I don't know. I don't remember a lot of things that never happened.
什么012---Wha--
拜托  记得我们在卧室外的走廊  一直笑一直笑吗012---Come on! Remember, we were on the sleeping porch? We couldn't stop giggling.
我们戴的椰子壳都撞在一起了012---And our coconuts kept knocking together.
哦  乔伊的脑袋该爆炸了012---Oh, somewhere Joey's head is exploding.
对吧  听着  抱歉  我不是想让你难堪012---Yeah—but come on—Listen, I'm sorry I don't want to make you uncomfortable...
但我告诉菲比那件事  她不相信我012---...but I told Phoebe it happened, and she doesn't believe me.
对不起  瑞瑞  如果我认为真有那回事  我会承认的012---I'm sorry. Ray-ray. I mean, if I thought it happened, I would say it.
也许我醉睡过去后  你亲了我012---Maybe I passed out and you did stuff to me while I was sleeping.
