嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
摩妮卡  我看到保时捷停在前门口012---Hey uh Mon, I saw the Porsche parked out front.
钥匙能借我一下吗  我想带那个坏男孩出去兜几圈012---Can I get the keys? Thought I'll take that bad boy out for a little spin.
等等  罗斯可以开  我问你时  你说只有你能开012---Wait a minute! You let Ross drive the Porsche and when I ask you, you say you're the only one who's allowed to drive it.
他是我哥哥啊  而且他开的很慢   不会出事的012---Yeah, well he's my brother, And plus he drives so slow he couldn't never hurt it.
那是辆车  摩妮卡  不是火箭012---It's a car, Monica, not a rocket ship.
随便啦  罗斯012---Whatever, Ross.
兜完风后  帮我换一下煞车灯的灯泡012---Just replace the bulbs in the brake lights after you're done.
嘿  嗨012---Hey. Hi.
我看到保时捷了  真的很酷  我什么时候能再开出去兜风啊012---Saw the Porsche  out there Mon, Looking good. When do I get to take that baby out again?
你让乔伊开保时捷  我从来没开过  一次都没有012---You let Joey drive it? I've never driven it. Okay? Not once.
好吧  只有一次  好吧  我常常开012---Okay, once. Okay, I drive it all the time.
感谢大家  "你可以开  但别告诉瑞秋" 计划宣告失败012---Nice work everybody! So much for the y'know, "you can drive it but don't tell Rachel" plan.
哇  真不敢相信你们骗我012---Wow, I can't believe you lied to me.
这事交给我来吧  摩妮卡  瑞秋认为你脑子里只想着婚礼012---Okay, I can fix this. Okay Monica, Rachel thinks all you can talk about is the wedding.
瑞秋  我不让你开保时捷  是因为你是个糟糕的司机012---Great! Well Rachel, the reason why I won't let you drive the Porsche is because you're a terrible driver.
怎么样   跟婚礼无关吧012---There. That wasn't about the wedding.
瑞秋  如果你想坐保时捷去兜风  我可以带你在附近转转012---Look Rach if-if you want to go for a ride in the Porsche, I’ll be glad to take you for a quick spin around the block.
你有几个小时吗012---Yeah, you got a couple hours?
老友记  第七季  第22集  钱德之父012---Friends  S07E22  The One With Chandler's Dad
喔  兜风真痛快啊012---Whew, that was a brisk ride.
你敞开了篷跑  对不对  这样才能感觉在飞012---Take the top down, did you? Only way to fly.
罗斯把钥匙给我  摩妮卡错了  我是个很棒的司机012---Come on Ross give me the keys. Monica does not know what she's talking about! I'm an excellent driver.
你开的又快又不可靠  结论就是一个差司机012---You're fast and irresponsible. That adds up to a bad driver.
高中时  我那些特点让我当上了啦啦队长012---Well in high school, that added up to head cheerleader.
你有没有看到那个女孩在注视着我012---Did you see the look that girl just gave me, huh?
她一定看到了我开保时捷兜风的帅样012---She must've seen me cruising in the bad boy.
我想她在看你的一头乱鸡窝  什么012---I think she's checking out your beehive Ross. What?
梳子给我  钥匙给我012---Give me a brush. Give me the keys.
不行  那就不给梳子012---No way! Well, no brush.
好吧  没关系012---Fine. Y'know what? It doesn't matter.
如果我没记错  洗手间地上有一把梳子012---because, if I remember correctly, there's a comb on the floor of the bathroom.
离婚赡养费012---Alimony.
钱德  你爸还没寄回函给我们012---Chandler, we still haven't gotten an RSVP from your dad.
喔  对啊  也许是因为我没有寄给他邀请信012---Oh, right. Urn, maybe that's because I didn't send him an invitation.
钱德  他是你父亲呀  他应该出席我们的婚礼012---Chandler, he's your father. He should be at your wedding.
我甚至不认得他  我们不亲  我好几年没跟他见过面了012---I don't even know the man. Okay? We're not the close.I haven't seen him in years.
如果他知道我们没有邀请他呢012---Well what are you gonna do when he finds out he wasn't even asked?
他又不会知道  我们的生活圈不一样012---Well he doesn't have to know! It's not like we run in the same circles.
我跟你们混在一起  而他012---I hang out with you guys and he...
他在拉斯维加斯表演变装秀012---...stars in a drag show in Vegas.
我想和他交换生活圈012---Ooh, I think I want to trade circles.
相信我  你不会想邀请他来  没有人会看新娘012---Trust me, you don't want him there either. Okay? Nobody is gonna be stare at the bride...
因为新郎的爸爸穿着露背洋装012---...when the groom's father's wearing a back-less dress.
那又怎么样012---Heh, so what?
只要他不穿婚纱  我根本不在乎012---As long as he's not wearing a white dress and a veil, I don't care.
我想我得去买点东西012---Okay, I think I need to do some shopping.
太棒了012---Ooh, nice.
我的天啊012---My God!
你以为你在做什么  我只是在清洗挡风玻璃012---What do you think you're doing? Just washing the windshield.
我绝不会让你开这辆车012---There's no way I am letting you drive this car.
把钥匙还给我吧012---So why don't you just hand over the keys?
不  不要启动车子012---No ah-ah-ah! Do not start this car.
好吧  我给你二十块012---Okay, okay. I will give you 2O bucks...
只要你立刻下车012---...if you get out of this car right now.
听着012---Look.
罗斯  如果你真的那么害怕  就上车吧012---Ross, If you're so freaked out, just get in the car.
跟你一起去兜风  是噢012---With you? Yeah, right.
好吧012---All right.
好吧  好吧  好吧012---Okay, okay, okay.
你在干什么  坐到前面来  要我坐死亡座椅012---What are you doing? Get in front. In the death seat?
嘿  大家好  嗨  甜心012---Hey, guys. Hi, sweetie.
准备好了吗  我的皮包在摩妮卡家  我去拿回来012---Ready to go? Yeah! Sure! Ooh, I left my purse up at Monica's. I'll be right back.
等一下  什么012---Wait a minute. What?
好012---Oh.
哇012---Ooh!
我还在头晕012---Whoa, oh, that one kept going.
你跟菲比在交往012---So, you and Phoebe, huh?
交往多久了  一个多月了把012---How long have you been going out? Over a month
我们应该彼此多多了解012---Wow. Maybe uh, maybe you and I ought to get to know each other a little better.
当然  我很愿意  对嘛  所以012---Sure. I'd like that. Yeah. So, uh...
你叫什么名字012---What's your name?
我是杰克  我是乔伊012---It's Jake. Joey.
杰克  你喜欢《尼克队》吗  当然  忠实球迷呀012---Hey Jake, Do you like the Knicks? Yeah, big fan.
我也是  星期二有比赛  想去吗012---Me too. There's a game on Tuesday. Do you want to go?
太棒了  我得先确定星期二我没事012---Yeah that would be great! Let me make sure I'm not doing anything Tuesday.
拿去吧012---Here.
这是什么  你的行李  我们要去拉斯维加斯012---What's this? It's your suitcase. We're going to Las Vegas.
真的吗  要私奔吗  不必再筹备那个该死的婚礼012---Are you serious? I mean like eloping?! No more stupid wedding stuff.
不必再烦恼这些花或那些花  想想这样我们能省多少钱012---No more these flowers, or these flowers or these flowers— Think of the money we'll save.
我们不是私奔  我喜欢花  我们的婚礼能再盛大一点吗  拜托012---We're not eloping. I love the flowers. Can our wedding be bigger, please?
我们要去拉斯维加斯找你爸012---We're going to Las Vegas to see your dad.
你们该聚一聚了  我也想认识我公公012---It's time you two talked, and I want to get to know my father-in-law.
我们已经谈过这事了  我赢了012---Y'know we already went over this and I won.
不  你没赢  甜心  你应该知道012---No, you didn't. Oh and honey, just so you know...
现在是你要娶我  你就赢不了的012---Now that you're marrying me, you don't get to win anymore.
还是算了吧  我不想去  我不想见到他  我不想012---Look forget it okay? I don't want to go. I don't want to see him. I don't wanna.
钱德  我知道你爸让你觉得丢脸012---Chandler, look I-I know that your dad embarrassed you. I know...
不  不  所有的小孩  都会觉得自己的父母很丢脸012---No-no all kids are embarrassed by their parents.
你应该多知道一些我的经历012---you'd have to come up with a whole new word for what I went through.
高中的时候  他参加了我所有的游泳比赛012---When I was in high school, he used to come to all my swim meets...
每次都装扮成不同的好莱坞明星012---...dressed as a different Hollywood starlet.
对于我14的人来说是很痛苦的012---It's hard enough to be 14.
瘦巴巴的  连紧身泳裤都太大  你妈妈保证说有一天你会长大成熟012---You're skinny, You're wearing Speedos--That your morn promised you'd grow into.
你要是往好的方面看  那是你爸爸给你加油012---You look up in the stands. There's your dad cheering you on.
他打扮成卡门米兰达  戴着有真水果的头巾作装饰012---Dressed as Carmen Miranda, wearing a headdress with real fruit...
之后他会把那些水果  做为健康零食  发给你的朋友012---...that he'll later hand out to your friends as a healthy snack.
重点是他参加了  你每一场游泳比赛  帮你加油012---Hey, the point is that he was at every one of your swim meets and he was there cheering you on.
这说明  他是个好爸爸012---Okay? That's a, that's a pretty great dad.
他还跟嘉利巴迪老师上床012---He had sex with Mr. Garibaldi.
嘉利巴迪是谁  那很重要吗012---Who's Mr. Garibaldi? Does it matter?
钱德012---Chandler...
你不再是14岁的孩子  好吗  那些事或许你该放下了012---You're not 14 anymore, okay? Maybe it's time you let that stuff go.
如果你的父亲没来参加婚礼  你会抱憾终生的012---If your father's not at your wedding, you're gonna regret it for the rest of your life.
好吧  但我这么做是为了你012---Okay, but I'm just doing this for you.
太好了012---Yes!
我永远都赢不了吗  你以前又赢过几次012---So I really never get to win anymore? How much did ever really win before?
菲比  嘿012---Pheebs. Hey.
你知道当你穿着裤子  身体向前倾时012---Listen, you know how, uh, when you're wearing pants and you lean forward...
我偷看你的内裤吗012---...I check out your underwear?
知道啊012---Yeah.
嗯  当杰克身体往前倾时012---Well, when Jake did it... Mm-hm.
我看到他穿着女人的内裤012---...I saw that he was wearing women's underwear.
我知道  那是我的012---I know. They were mine.
不  不  等一下  那太奇怪了012---No, no, wait. That's weird.
不会啊  我们只是闹着玩  我跟他打赌他不敢穿012---No, it’s not! We were just goofing around, and I dared him to try them on.
那真的很奇怪012---That's weird!
我正穿着他的内裤  那还蛮性感的012---I'm wearing his briefs right now. That's kind of hot.
我也那么想  你知道那个小洞吗  刚好拿来放我的口红012---I think so too. And that little flap? Great for holding my lipstick.
我倒是不知道那一点012---Yeah, I wouldn't know about that.
杰克说  其实女人的内裤更舒服012---And! Y'know what Jake says? That women's underwear is actually more comfortable.
他喜欢丝质内裤  贴在皮肤上的感觉012---And he loves the way the silk feels against his skin.
接下来他会说  穿上你的高跟鞋  他更婀娜多姿012---Yeah well next thing you know, he'll be telling you that your high heels are good for his posture.
杰克没有什么不正常的  他很有男人味012---There's nothing wrong with Jake. He is all man.
我认为他比你更有男人味012---I'm thinking even more than you.
没错  他就好像穿着粉色蕾丝装的伐木工人012---Oh yeah, he looked like a real lumberjack in those pink laoies.
我是说  只有对自己的男子汉气概有信心的人012---I'm just saying that only a man completely secure with his masculinity...
才敢穿着女人的内裤到处走  我敢说你办不到012---...could walk around in women's underwear. I don't think you could ever do that.
我很相信我的男子气概  好吧  随你说吧012---Hey! I am secure with my masculinity. Okay, whatever.
你都看过我收藏的色情杂志吧012---You've seen my huge stack of porn right?
天啊  我都忘了我有多爱开车了012---God, I forgot how much I love driving.
我得去换新驾照了012---I have got to get my license renewed.
你的驾照过期了  马上停车012---You don't have a valid driver's license? Okay that is it! Pull over right now.
罗斯  你太紧张了  尽管放轻松012---Oh Ross you're so tense. You just gotta relax,
好吗  你只需要放轻松  好吗  放轻松012---Okay? Just need to relax. All right? Just need to relax.
你干什么  一点都不好笑  别闹了012---What-what are you doing?! Are you—Okay that's not funny. Just stop horsing around.
我没有胡闹  好吗012---I am not horsing around, okay?
我在 "开保时捷" 兜风012---I am "Porsche-ing" around.
保持冷静  不会有事的  你没有惹上大麻烦012---Okay, stay calm. Nothing is going to happen to you, You're not in that much trouble.
真的吗  你那么认为012---Really? You think so?
我是在跟自己说话  你死定了012---I'm talking to myself. You're going down!
你们点过东西了吗012---Has someone taken your order yet?
对  她来过了  是他才对  还是她  抱歉  我第一次来  我不012---Oh, yeah. She did. Um, he did. She? I'm sorry, I'm new. I don't...
我点了杯啤酒  你是异性恋  我明白了012---Yeah, I just ordered a beer. You're straight. I get it.
如果我们打电话给你爸  就能坐到比较好一点的位置012---I still say that if we had called your dad, we'd have better seats.
我不想让他知道我们来了  我还  我还没准备好012---No! No! I don't want him to know we're here yet. I'm not sure I'm ready for that.
而且他看到我也不会太高兴012---And besides he's not gonna be too happy to see me either.
为什么012---Why not?
我不知道有没有告诉过你  他一直尝试和我联系012---I don't know if I've told you this, but he's kind of tried to get in contact with me...
过去几年来有很多次了  什么012---...a lot over the last few years. What?
对  他打过电话  写信给我012---Yeah. He's made phone calls, written letters.
他曾来过纽约  但我总是说太忙没空看他012---He even came to New York. but I always said I was too busy to see him.
整个就是 "复杂的要命"  我不想再说那些了012---Y'know it's very "Cat's in the Cradle." I don't want to get into it.

这太奇怪了  我昨晚做了一个梦  梦到我被警察拦下来012---Y'know, it's weird. but I had a dream last night where I was stopped by a policeman.
然后他012---And then he, um...
或许我不该告诉你  接下来的情节012---Well, I probably shouldn't tell you the rest.

我开始明白杰克的意思了012---You know, I'm beginning to see what Jake was talking about.
真丝内裤的感觉真的很舒服012---Uh-huh. The silk feels really good.
而那玩意儿不像我想像中那样  会挤成一团012---And things aren't as smashed down as I thought they would be.

那我一定会去的012---Then I wouldn't miss it for the world.
我都热泪盈眶了012---Oh, I'm getting all misty here. Ha!
你们一定会以为  我刚刚用热蜡除过腿毛012---You'd think I was having my legs waxed or something.
你还好吗  我很好012---You okay? Yeah.
谢谢你逼我这么做012---Thanks for making me do this.

他想做什么  我什么都没做012---What does he want? I wasn't doing anything.
或许他看到你的手  不小心从十点和两点的位置滑下来012---Well maybe he saw your hands slip briefly from the 10 and 2:00 position.
