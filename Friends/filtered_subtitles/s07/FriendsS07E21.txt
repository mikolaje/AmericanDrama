对  你写了你的了吗  还没有  但我知道我要说什么012---Right. So uh, have you written yours yet? No, but I know exactly what I'm gonna say.
你会不会刚好知道  我要说什么呢012---Do you happen to know what I'm gonna say?
现在写  没有那么困难012---Let's just do it right now. Okay? It won't be hard.
说你心里想的012---Just say what's in your heart.

"摩妮卡  我一遇到你就爱上了你"012---"Monica, from the moment I met you I knew I loved you."
我做不到012---Yeah, I' m not sure I can't do that.

好吧  假如人类发生了一场核子浩劫  我是地球上最后一个男人012---All right, there's a nuclear holocaust. I'm the last man on Earth.
你会和我约会吗012---Would you go outwith me?
婚礼誓词里可以说谎吗012---Ooh! Are we allowed to lie in the vows?
也许那时不要谈你的感情   就说些012---Well maybe you don't talk about those feelings back then. Maybe you just say something about y'know ...

这样吧  我告诉你012---All right, I'll tell you what.
等40岁的时候  如果我们都还没结婚012---When we're 40, if neither of us are married...
我们俩来生个如何  我为什么会40岁还没结婚012---...what do you say you and I get together and have one? Why wouldn't I be married when I'm 40?
不  不  我只是说"假设"012---Oh, no, no, no. I just meant hypothetically.
好  我们来假设  我为什么会40岁还没结婚012---Ok, Hypothetically, why won't I be married when I'm 40?

你的东西都会在这里012---Then all your stuff would be here.
那012---Well...
如果我的东西都在这里呢012---What if all my stuff was here?
那你会一直来回跑来跑去012---Then you'd be going back and forth all the time.
干嘛要那样呢012---Doesn't make any sense.
好012---0Kay.
那如果我们是住在一起  你明白我在说什么嘛012---What if we live together, and you understand what I'm saying?
你希望这是一个惊喜012---You wanted it to be a surprise.
我的天012---Oh, my God!
钱德012---Chandler...
我这一生012---...in all my life...
从没想过我会这么幸运012---...I never thought I'd be so lucky...

我最好的  女生不这么做是有原因的012---My best-There's a reason why girls don't do this!
好  好  我来012---Okay, okay, okay! I'll do it.
我以为012---I thought--
我做得到012---I can do this.
我以为012---I thought...
我说什么  和在哪里说很重要012---...that it mattered what I said or where I said it.
但我发现唯一重要的是你012---Then I realized the only thing that matters is that you--
你让我比我能想像的更快乐012---You make me happier than I ever thought I could be.
如果你愿意012---And if you let me...

因为乔伊老是想一些不合时宜的点子012---because Joey kept making inappropriate suggestions.
"摩妮卡  我爱你的美臀"  这有什么不得体012---How is "Monica, I love your sweet ass" inappropriate?
摩妮卡写得怎么样了012---How's Monica coming along with her vows?
这样说吧  幸好她有一个美臀  因为她不太擅长写作012---Well let's just say its she's lucky she's got a sweet ass. She's not so good at writing.
真不敢相信再过4个星期  他们就要结婚了012---I can't believe in four weeks they're gonna be married!

不知道他们为什么不直接告诉我们  对啊  好像我们不会认同似的012---I don't know why they didn't just tell us. I know, I mean it's not like we weren't cool about it.
你  还有你012---You? And you?

我一定要告诉别人  不  不要012---I have to tell someone. No-no-no-no-no!

对  但你知道吗  谁知道什么并不重要012---Yes, but y'know what? it doesn't matter who knows what.
现在有足够的人知道  就可以告诉他们我们知道了012---Now, enough of us know that we can just tell them that we know.
谎言  秘密终于可以结束了012---Then all the lying and the secrets would finally be over!
或者我们不要告诉他们我们知道  我们就可以找点小乐子012---Or, we can not tell them we know and have a little fun of our own.
好  如果想赶上电影的话  我们该走了012---All right honey, We better go if we're gonna catch that movie.

乔伊  你什么也不能说012---Joey, you can't say anything.
就算我想说  也不知道要怎么说012---I couldn't even if I wanted too.
这完全失控了012---Listen, this is totally getting out of hand.
她要我替她抹乳液  她在唬你012---Okay? She wants me to put lotion on her! She's bluffing!
她没有退缩  她还这样012---Look, she's not backing down. She went like this.
他没有退缩  他去拿乳液了012---He's not backing down. He went to get lotion.

会和其他有孩子的夫妇在一起012---...and then they're just gonna be hanging out with other couples who have kids.
也许他们会搬离城市012---And then maybe they're gonna have to leave the city...
到某个靠近富豪车商的地方012---...to be near a Volvo dealership.
事情会变的012---Well, things change.
我不要他们搬到  卖富豪车的地方012---I don't want them to move to a Volvo dealership.
