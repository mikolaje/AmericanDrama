试镜  我还以为  你们决定让我饰演那个角色012---Audition?  I thought you were offering me the part.
为什么你会那么想呢012---Why would you think that?
我演过德瑞克医生  他是史崔克的双胞胎哥哥012---I was Doctor Drake Ramoray, Stryker's twin brother.
谁会比我长得更像我呢012---I mean, who looks more like me than me, right?

你办公室里有植物012---There is a plant in your office.
可以那么说012---Kind of.
对012---Right.
我猜我不应该在履历表上写着  "注意力敏锐"012---So I guess I shouldn't put "good at noticing stuff" on my resume.
谢谢  总之012---Thank you. Anyway...
我猜你录取了别人012---Anyway...I'm guessing you hired somebody.
那个嘛012---Well...

我又没有说  "该怎么做才会更好玩呢"012---It's not like—It's not like I said, "What would make this ride more fun?"
对  你说的对  抱歉  我不该笑的012---Right. You're right, I'm sorry. I shouldn't be laughing.
我应该帮你先铺好报纸012---I should be laying down papers for you.

一会儿之后  他走过去   一两分钟后我看到他们在接吻012---So after awhile he goes over to her and, uh, after a minute or two, I see them kissing.
你不会觉得他是那种会在酒吧里  泡女人的男人012---You're thinking, Chandler's  not the type to go to bars and make out with girls.
你是对的   他的确不是那种012---And you're right. Chandler's not the type of guy ...
在酒吧里泡女人的男人012---...who just goes to bars and make out with "girls."
你跟男人接吻012---You kissed a guy?
我的天啊012---Oh, my God!

罗斯得了第四名   抱头痛哭012---Ross came in fourth and cried!
我的天啊012---Oh, my God!
那很好笑吗   你觉得那很好笑吗012---Oh, is that funny? Oh, You find that funny?
或许钱德也应该   知道你的一些秘密012---Well maybe Chandler should know your secrets too.

等一下  《我们的日子》呢012---Wait a minute, what happened to Days of our Lives?
他们有点生我的气012---Uh, well, they might be a little mad at me over there.
怎么了012---What happened?
或许我有点太嚣张了   我告诉他们该怎么做012---Well, maybe I got a little upset, and maybe I told them where they could go.
乔伊   你为什么要那么做呢012---Joey, why would you do that?

你可是个演员   那么做太过分了012---You, an actor? That's madness!
