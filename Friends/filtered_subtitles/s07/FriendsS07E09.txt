我准备好了012---I'm ready.
你确定012---You sure? Uh-huh.
好  让我帮你把头盔戴好012---Okay, let me just straighten out your helmet there.
谢谢你  爸爸  不  一个爸爸  二个妈妈012---Thanks, Daddy. No, no. One daddy, two mommies.
好了  你去吧  没问题012---All right, it's all yours. Okay, okay.
加油  加油012---There you go, there you go.
这是小班第一次骑脚踏车   我真的是好兴奋012---Wow, Ben's first big kid's bike. This is so exciting.
对  我还记得我的第一次012---Oh, yeah, I remember mine.
是我六岁的生日  我爸带我到公园去012---It was my sixth birthday. My dad took me to the park...
刚坐上脚踏车  它就垮了  没错012---...and I got on it and...it bent. Yeah.
我从来就没有属于自己的脚踏车  什么012---I never had a bike of my own. What?
我们家很穷012---Well, we didn't have a lot of money.
但住在对街的女孩  有一辆最酷的脚踏车012---But the girl across the street had the best bike.
是粉红色的  把手挂着五颜六色的流苏012---It was pink and it had rainbow-colored tassels hanging off the handle grips...
还有铃铛   一个白色的大篮子012---...and-and-and a bell, and this big, white wicker basket...
上面黏着塑胶做的小雏菊012---...with those plastic daisies stuck on.
听起来很像是我的第一辆脚踏车012---That sounds like my first bike.
我爸把他以前的脚踏车送给了我012---My dad gave me his old one.
那个女孩让你骑吗   不012---Did the girl ever let you ride it? No.
但她把装脚踏车的纸箱送给了我012---But she gave me the box that it came in.
纸箱前面印了脚踏车的图案012---It had a picture of the bike on the front.
我可以坐在上面  我继父会拖着我在后院跑012---So I would sit on it and my stepdad would drag me around the backyard.
真的太不公平了012---That is so unfair.
也不能那么说   我也会拖着他跑012---Not really, I got to drag him around too.
老友记  第七季  第9集  糖果皇后012---Friends S07E09  The One With All The Candy
嘿  你们在做什么012---Hey, what are you guys doing?
我在为邻居做糖果012---Making holiday candy for the neighbors.
对不起  你说谁012---I'm sorry, who?
我要在门上挂一个篮子012---I'm gonna hang this basket on the door.
只要邻居一走过去   就可以拿一块糖果012---and when the neighbors walk by, they can all take a piece.
但我们不认识我们的邻居   我认识啊012---But we don't know the neighbors. I do.
让我想一想   那个留胡子的男人012---There's, uh, let's see, the guy with the mustache...
老烟枪婆婆   我看过一些孩子012---...smokes-a-lot lady, some kids I've seen...
还有红头发的男人  他不喜欢别人叫他小红012---...and the red-haired guy who does not like to be called Rusty.
看吧   这就是我要做糖果的原因012---See, this is exactly why I'm making this candy.
这样可以知道他们的名字来认识邻居012---We can learn their names and get to know our neighbors.
搬家应该会比较简单一点吧012---Wouldn't it be easier if we just moved?
早安012---Good morning.
有人心情不错啊   我为什么要心情不好012---Ah, somebody's in a good mood. Well, why shouldn't I be?
我有很棒的朋友   有很棒的工作012---I have great friends. I have a wonderful job...
而且可以在办公室跟助理鬼混012---Where you can make out with your assistant.
少来啊  那也没什么大不了的012---Come on, it's not a big deal.
我们整晚没睡  都在想计划012---We stayed up all night coming up with a plan...
确保我们的交往不会有问题012---...so that us dating will not be a problem.
是吗  你们想出了什么计划012---Oh, yeah? What's the plan?
我们  我们不会012---We-We are not...
让它012---...going to let it...
变成问题吧012---...be a problem.
你们花了一整晚   想出那个计划012---Wow. It took you all night to come up with that plan?
你知道的  我们还做了别的事012---Oh, well, you know, we did other stuff too.
你们两个012---Did you two...?
喔  莫尼卡  我不会在第一次约会时就跟男伴上床012---Oh, Monica come on, you know I don't sleep with guys on the first date.
麦特威尔  马克林恩   班韦斯  我已经不会了012---Matt Wire, Mark Lynn, Ben Wise. Anymore.
秦格  今天我要开会  对吧012---Hi, Tag, um, I have a conference call today, is that correct?
没错  4点开会   谢谢你   没事了012---Yes, at 4. Okay, thank you, that'll be all.
等一下  等一下012---Wait, wait.
你看到了吗012---Did you see that?
他没发现我们在谈恋爱012---That mail guy had no idea there was something going on between us.
我得回去工作了  好吧   工作狂012---I'd better get back to my desk. Okay, you hard worker!
我会在你的评估表里提到那一点012---I'll remember to put that in your evaluation.
我哪一点   你已经来上班两个月了012---My what? You've been here for two months now...
你的上司必须为你的表现做个评估012---...and your boss is required to hand in a performance evaluation.
但你知道吗  有一件事  我至今还没有做评估012---But you know, there is one thing that I have yet to evaluate.
你是认真的吗  不  我一直都想那么做012---Are you serious? No, I've just always wanted to do that.
你可以帮我把东西捡起来吗012---Can you help me clean this up?
篮子是空的  天呐  邻居们把糖果都吃掉了012---The basket is totally empty. My God, the neighbors ate all the candy.
喔  不然的话就是012---Well, either that or, uh...
乔伊012---Joey.
什么事012---Yeah?
你吃掉给邻居们的糖果了吗   本来我打算要那么做的012---Did you eat all the neighbor candy? Uh, well, yeah, that was the plan.
但是我走到篮子边时   发现里面就只剩几块糖果了012---But by the time I got to it there was only a couple of pieces left.
整天人潮川流不急   他们喜欢的不得了012---Yeah. They've been coming by all day. They love it.
他们喜欢我的糖果012---They love my candy?
天啊   我得多做点了   嘿   摩妮卡012---Oh, man, I gotta go make more. Hey, Mon.
多做一点千层面  因为有人可能吃了一大块012---you might wanna make some more lasagna too. because something might have happened to a huge chunk of it.
罗斯  我的邻居吃光了我的糖果012---Ross, the neighbors ate all my candy.
我的邻居偷走我的报纸012---Mine stole my newspaper.
这简直就是犯罪潮012---It's like a crime wave.
菲比  你有空吗012---Pheebs, you, uh, got a second?
当然有  嗯012---Sure. Yeah.
从你告诉我  那个脚踏车的故事后012---Ever since you, uh, told me that story about that bike...
它一直就在我脑中挥之不去012---...I couldn't stop thinking about it.
我是说大家都该有第一辆脚踏车  你知道吗  所以012---I mean, everyone should have a first bike, you know? So...
我的天啊   罗斯012---Oh, my God, Ross.
你喜欢吗   我爱死它了012---You like it? I love it.
是吗   喔  天啊012---Yeah? Oh. Oh, God...
我爱你012---And I love you. Ah.
不是那一种爱012---Not that way.
但这辆脚踏车   让你跟我更亲近了012---But the bike got you a lot closer. Oh.
这样  把它拿到楼下去012---Well, uh, take it downstairs.
试骑一下012---You know, give it a test drive.
好的  我的天啊012---Okay. Oh, my God.
我的第一辆脚踏车012---My first bike.
谢谢你   这是我收过的最棒的礼物012---Thank you for the best present I've ever gotten.
别客气012---You're welcome.
钱德都快哭了012---Oh, and Chandler's about to cry.
我才没有012---Am not.
是谁012---Who is that?
别担心  我很勇敢  我很勇敢  我我很勇敢012---Don't worry, I'm brave. I am brave. I-I am brave.
不  不  不012---No, no, no, no, no.
请问你是谁012---Can you tell me who is there, please?
我是盖瑞   我住在楼上012---My name's Gary. I live upstairs.
嗨  嗨012---Hi. Hi.
你知道现在几点了吗   现在是糖果时间012---Do you know what time it is? It's candy time.
我室友说它们吃起来   就像是天上掉下来的礼物012---My roommate says that they taste like little drops of heaven.
喔  拜托012---Oh, please. Heh.
你听到了吗   "天上掉下来的礼物"012---Did you hear that? "Little drops of heaven."
凌晨4点012---Four a.m.
你能给我一点糖果吗012---So can I get some candy?
对不起   我们之中还有人得早起去上班012---I am sorry, but some of us have to get up early and go to work.
他不知道我不是 "那个人"012---He does not know that I am not "some of us."
对不起  但明天一大早我会做一些糖果012---Um, listen, I'm sorry, but I'll put some out first thing in the morning.
那好吧   我待会儿再来拿012---Well, okay, I'll swing by later.
你住在这里012---You live in this building? Mm-hm.
我应该会记得你012---Mm. Seems like I would have remembered you.
晚安   盖瑞012---Mm. Night, Gar.
你看了你的评估表吗012---So did you read your evaluation yet?
没有  上面写了 "极机密"012---No, it was marked "confidential."
我刚刚把它送到人事处了012---I just sent it down to Human Resources.
拜托  你是在开玩笑  对吧  我故意写那份评估表来跟你开玩笑012---Okay, please, you're kidding, right? I wrote that one as a joke for you.
他们会喜欢这个玩笑吗012---A joke they would appreciate?
我想不会012---I'm thinking no.
你写了什么   我说你是个接吻高手012---What did you say? Um, I said that you were a good kisser...
我喜欢你又小又挺的屁股012---...and, uh, that I liked your your tiney-tiny touchie.
不  你不该那么说012---No, not my touchie.
还有更糟糕的事012---Well, it gets worse.
关于你的主动性   我写012---When asked if you take initiative, I wrote:
"他几乎不需要指导  就能解开我的胸罩"012---"Yes, he was able to unhook my bra with minimal supervision."
至于你的表现会不会有问题  我写  "天啊  希望不要有"012---And under problems with performance, I wrote, "Dear God, I hope not."
然后然后我画了一个微笑的小脸012---And then, uh-And then I drew a little smiley face.
还有一张色情小素描012---And then a small pornographic sketch.
罗斯  你送菲比脚踏车真的太贴心了012---Ross, that is so sweet of you to get Phoebe that bike.
我听到那个故事  差点就哭了012---When I heard the story, I almost cried.
你差点哭了012---Almost cried, huh?
你听到了吗   钱德  "差点"哭了012---Hear that, Chandler? "Almost" cried.
只要有人提到《铁达尼号》  你每次都会哭012---Hey, you cry every time somebody talks about Titanic.
他们两个只有彼此012---Those two had only each other.
菲比真的很喜欢它吧012---Phoebe really likes the bike, huh?
对  我看到她带着它过街012---Oh, yeah. I saw her walking it down the street the other day.
车篮子里面还有花   真的很可爱012---She had these flowers in the basket. It was so cute.
今天早上我还看到她   带着它在公园里散步012---Yeah, I saw her this morning walking it by the park.
等等   她带着脚踏车  两次都是012---Wait a minute, she was walking the bike? Both times?
嗨  菲比  嗨012---Hey, Pheebs. Oh, hi.
你喜欢脚踏车吗   非常喜欢012---Hey, so you enjoying the bike? Oh, uh-huh, so much. Heh.
菲比  你会骑脚踏车吧012---Pheebs, you, uh-You do know how to ride a bike, don't you? Heh.
当然会012---Of course.
我们能看看你骑脚踏车吗012---Can we see you ride it?
好吧012---0Kay.
看到了吗012---See?
我早就跟你说过了   不要跟助理交往012---This is why I told you never get involved with your assistant.
只要是地下情   绝对是纸包不住火的012---And there's no such thing as keeping secrets when it comes to having affairs.
你听到了吗   钱德012---Did you hear that, Chandler?
纸是包不住火的012---No such thing.
发生了什么事   我只是在吃糖果012---What happened? I'm just eating candy.
或许没有那么糟糕   他们可能看不懂我的意思012---Maybe it's not as bad as I think. Y'know, maybe they didn't take it the way I meant it.
当然   你知道吗   因为"小屁屁"可以指屁股012---Absolutely, you know? Because "tushy" can mean both ass...
或者是好员工012---...and good worker.
我得把评估表拿回来012---Ugh, I just gotta get the thing back.
瑞秋   还记得你提到的素描吗012---Rach? That sketch you mentioned?
它跟这素描很像吗012---Might it have looked a little something like this?
我的天啊   乔伊012---Oh, my God, Joey.
你是怎么了  天啊012---What is the matter with you? God.
在我买不起色情杂志前   这点天份还蛮有用的012---Boy I tell ya, this little talent came in handy before I could afford porn.
嗨   对不起  我知道现在是休息时间  但我真的需要糖果012---Hi, I'm sorry. I know it's after hours, but I really need candy.
对不起  我帮不了你  看到了吗  没规定就是规定012---I'm sorry, I can't help you. See? Rules are rules.
拜托  我住在外地的朋友  今天来看我012---Please, I have people coming from out of town today.
我跟他们提起你的糖果   开玩笑吧012---I told them all about your candy. No kidding,
他们是外地来的   你怎么跟他们说的012---Out-of-towners, huh? Heh. What did you tell them?
我告诉他们你的糖果   真的是好吃到无法形容012---I told them your candy was absolutely indescribable.
有人说它是 "天上 掉下来的礼物"  但那不重要012---Well, some people have been saying it's "little drops of heaven," but whatever.
拜托   你不能帮帮我吗  钱德   我们认识那位女士吗012---Please, can't you help me out? Hey, Chandler, do we know that lady?
可能吧  她不是住在你楼下做爱时会大叫的那个女人吗012---Maybe. Isn't she the woman who lives below you and has sex really loud?
好吧   我只破例一次012---All right, I'll do it just this Once.
但你不能告诉任何人  好  求求你  快给我吧012---But you can't tell anybody. Yes, yes, please, just give it to me.
对  就是她012---Yeah, that's her.
谢谢你  不可思议012---Thank you. Unbelievable.
我不敢相信纸条居然没有用012---I can't believe that sign didn't work.
你知道怎么才会有用吗   别再做糖果了012---You know what would work? Stop making candy.
但他们喜欢它012---But they like it.
你是说他们喜欢你012---You mean they like you.
或许吧012---Maybe.
那就是你当厨师的原因   你要大家喜欢你012---Is that why you became a chef, so that people would like you?
你要跟我谈怎么让别人喜欢你吗   小丑012---Heh. You want to talk about getting people to like you, huh, funny man?
记住我教你的一切  你会没事的012---Okay, now, just remember everything I taught you and you'll be fine.
好吗  开始吧012---Okay? Here we go.
就位  预备012---Ready, set--
等一下   这个座垫真的很不舒服012---Wait, this seat is really uncomfortable.
不如先换掉再来练习012---Maybe before we start we should just get another one.
或许我们该换个飞机座椅  或懒骨头012---Perhaps like an airplane seat, or a beanbag chair.
菲比  你不能逃避这件事  你得学会骑脚踏车012---Phoebe, you can't get out of this, okay? You have to learn how to ride a bike.
为什么  为什么我非学不可012---Why? Why do I have to learn?
以防发生紧急事故  什么样的紧急事故012---Well, in case of an emergency. What kind of emergency?
如果有人走过来   拿枪抵着你的头说012---Well let there—what if a man comes along and puts a gun to your head and says:
"快骑上脚踏车  不然我会012---"You ride this bike or I'll--
我会开枪打你"012---I'll shoot you."
我会按铃铛分散他的注意力012---Okay. I would ring the bell to distract him...
然后我会用中国飞镖   把那个家伙敲昏012---...and then I would knock the gun out of his hand with a Chinese throwing star.
好吧   菲比  快坐上脚踏车012---Okay, Phoebe, just get on the bike...
我会扶着你   推你  好吗012---...and, hey, I'll hold you up and push you. Okay?
你不会放手012---You won't let go?
我不会  你发誓012---No. You swear?
我发誓012---I swear.
好吧   来吧012---Okay. Come on.
好了  要开始了  好吗   好吧012---Here we go. All right? All right? All right.
感觉不错吧   好了  试着踩踏板012---Feel good? All right, try pedaling.
对了  做的好  对  控制住车子012---That's it, you're doing great. Yes, take control.
这就对了  嘿012---Yes, yes, yes. Whee! Hey!
喔  不012---Oh, no.
你发过誓的012---You swore.
我认为你骑得很好了  我真的很震惊012---I just thought you were doing so well. I am shocked. Shocked.
大家都是那样子学脚踏车的012---It's a legitimate learning technique.
嘿012---Hey.
外面有些人在问糖果的事012---There's, uh, some people outside asking about candy.
他们得等  好吗  我只有两只手012---Well, they're just gonna have to wait, aren't they? I only got two hands.
需要我帮忙吗  不  你不熟悉流程012---Need some help? No, you don't know the system.
我不希望任何人破坏我的流程012---I don't need nobody messing with the system.
还有  你结婚前一个星期  不会常常看到我012---By the way, the week before your wedding, you may not see a lot of me.
嗨  骗子012---Oh, hello, liar.
听着  我真的很抱歉  放开了你的脚踏车012---Look, I'm really sorry I let go of the bike.
我可能会没命的012---I could've been killed, I hope you know.
我知道  我知道012---I know, I know.
但你能再试一次吗012---But can we please try it again?
我是说  你只差一点就成功了  菲比012---I mean, you were so close, Phoebe.
喔  我很乐意012---Well, I would love to...
但脚踏车被偷了  警察找不到嫌犯012---...but the bike got stolen and the police have no suspects.
菲比  什么012---Phoebe. What?
怎么会这样012---What the hell?
好  你知道吗012---All right, you know what?
如果你不学骑脚踏车  那么我很抱歉012---If you are not going to learn how to ride this bike, then I'm sorry...
我得把它收回去  什么  为什么012---...I'm just gonna have to take it back. What? Why?
因为  因为它012---Because. Because it's...
它就像你买了这把吉他012---It'd be like you having this guitar...
却从来不弹它012---...and never playing it.
好吧  这把吉他希望被弹012---Okay, this guitar wants to be played.
这辆脚踏车希望被骑012---And this bike wants to be ridden.
如果你不骑它012---And if you don't ride it...
你就是在扼杀它的灵魂012---...you're killing its spirit.
脚踏车012---The bike...
快死了012---...is dying"
好吧  如果你真的那么在乎不惜撒下漫天大谎  我学就是了012---All right. If you care enough to make up that load of crap, okay.
太棒了012---Great.
你让脚踏车非常快乐012---You're making the bike very happy.
知道啦  罗斯012---Okay, Ross.
请不要死掉012---Please don't die.
我们得在他们看到评估表前  把它拿回来012---Okay, I think we can get the evaluation back before they see it.
所以我们得溜进塞纳的办公室   通常他十点才会到012---We have to get into Mr. Zelner's office. Now, he doesn't get in until 10, so he's no problem,
但他的助理贝蒂   一大早就会到办公室吃早餮012---But his assistant, Betty, comes in early to eat her breakfast at her desk.
那真的很悲惨   没错  贝蒂有点惨012---That's kind of sad. Yeah, well, Betty's kind of sad.
所以我相信我可以用这些巧克力把她诱开012---Which is why I believe I can lure her away with these chocolates.
我诱开她后   你就跑进去012---Now, while I distract her, you go in the office.
知道了  行动吧012---Got it. Let's roll.
嗨   瑞秋  你有空吗012---Hello, Rachel. You, uh, got a minute?
当然  塞纳先生  你有事吗   我随时都有空012---Yeah, sure, Mr. Zelner. For you? Anything. Minute.
好吧   太棒了012---Okay, great.
取消计划  取消计划012---Abort the plan. Abort the plan.
事实上  我想跟你们两个谈一谈012---Uh, actually, I'd like to speak to both of you.
好的012---0Kay.
有什么事需要帮忙吗  塞纳先生  或许你想吃点巧克力012---Uh, well can we, can we get you anything, Mr. Zelner? Maybe some chocolates?
不  谢谢你  但我可以把它们送给贝蒂012---Um, no, thanks, but I'll give these to Betty.
我看过你对泰格做的评估表012---So I read your evaluation of Tag.
或许我该叫他的全名  泰格"小可爱"琼斯012---Or, uh, to use his full name, Tag "Sweet Cheeks" Jones?
你们之间有什么吗012---Is something going on with you two?
我的天啊   你能想像如果有  会怎么样吗012---Oh, my God, can you imagine if there was?
如果是那样的话  会怎样012---I mean, what would happen exactly?
那样啊   我一定得写份报告012---Well, I'd be forced to file a report.
我得跟法律部门商量012---I'd have to consult with the legal department.
你们在公司的未来  可能会有问题012---And your future at the company would be in jeopardy.
喔  塞纳先生012---Well-Uh, Mr. Zelner...
那份评估表是我写的012---...I'm the one who filled in that evaluation.
喔  不  对  对  对012---Oh, no-Yeah, yeah, yeah.
我以为这样会很好玩012---I thought it would be funny.
你写着你有可爱的小屁屁012---You wrote that you have a cute tushy?
对012---Yes.
我的幽默感很奇怪012---I have a weird sense of humor.
很奇怪地   我以自己的屁股为荣012---And I'm kind of strangely proud of my butt.
开这种玩笑太危险了  秦格012---It's kind of a risky joke, Tag.
这到底是在画的什么   我看不懂012---And what is-what is this drawing? I can't figure out what this is.
它倒过来了  你知道吗  那不重要012---You're looking at it upside down-You know what? It doesn't matter.
我不是没有幽默感的人012---Hey, it's not like I don't have a sense of humor, huh?
没错  我甚至很喜欢写挑逗性的打油诗012---Hell, I even enjoy a naughty limerick every now and then.
但时间跟地点是很重要的012---But there's a time and a place, huh?
除非你有写打油诗的灵感012---Unless you, uh, have a limerick right now.
没有吗  好吧   你知道我的传真机号码012---No? Okay. Well, uh, you've got my fax number.
我不敢相信你会那么做   那太贴心了012---I can't believe you did that. That was really sweet.
别担心  你可能会丢掉工作012---Ah, don't worry about it. No, you could've lost your job.
你在开玩笑吗  有这么可爱的屁股  我一定能找到工作012---Are you kidding me? With a cute butt like this, I'd find work.

糖果做好了  我得让它冷却15分钟012---Okay, guys, the candy is coming. I just need 15 minutes for the chocolate to cool.
好了  大伙们  安静  安静  请闭嘴012---All right, everybody, just be quiet. Be quiet. Be quiet. Pipe down.
你们是怎么了012---What is the matter with you people?
这个女人在为你们做好事012---This woman was trying to do a nice thing for you.
她想做糖果  是为了要认识你们012---She was making candy so she could try to get to know all of you...
我敢说你们没有人   能叫出她的名字012---...and I'll bet that not one of you can tell me her name.
我没说错吧012---Am I right?
她是糖果小姐012---Candy Lady?
不  不是 "糖果小姐"012---No, not "Candy Lady."
知道她的名字就能拿到糖果吗012---Hey, if we know it, can we have candy?

忘了糖果  你们毁了一切  毁了一切012---Forget it. All of you, forget it. You've ruined it.
回家去吧  你们毁了一切012---Go home. You've ruined it. You've ruined it.
那是不对的  你们毁了一切  你们毁了这个机会012---That's all wrong. You guys ruined everything. You ruined it.

你没事吧012---Uh, are you okay?
我没事   但刚刚真的有点可怕012---I'm fine now, but it was really scary there for a while.
有人将恐吓纸条   塞到门缝下012---I mean, someone slipped a threatening note under the door.
对了  我很抱歉  我受到暴动状态的影响012---Oh, yeah. Sorry about that. Mob mentality or whatever. I don't know.
