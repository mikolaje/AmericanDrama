再见012---Bye-bye.
我在米雪餐厅订好位子了012---I just got reservations at Michelle's...
还有《音乐人》的票来庆祝012---...and tickets to The MusicMan to celebrate...
我们成为"顶婚"夫妻后   第一个正式的节日012---...our first holiday as a betrothed couple.
是"订婚"   订婚夫妻012---"Betrothed." Betrothed couple.
嘿  嗨012---Hey. Hi.
菲比  嗯012---Pheebs? Uh-huh?
骷髅头012---Skull?
是啊  是我妈的012---Oh. Yeah, it's my mom's.
我的天012---Oh, my God!
不  不  不  不是我妈012---No, no, no. It's not my mom.
是属于我妈的012---It belonged to my mom.
她以前每次圣诞节都会拿出来012---She used to put it out every Christmas...
让我们记得即使是圣诞节  人还是会死的012---...to remind us that even though it's Christmas, people still die.
还可以放糖果在里面012---And you can put candy in it.
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
吃糖012---Licorice?
好啊012---Sure.
今年班和我起过节  太好了012---Hey, I just found out, I get Ben for the holidays this year. That's great!
你要扮成圣诞老公公吗   不要012---Are you gonna dress up as Santa? Nope.
我知道苏珊每年都会这么做012---I mean, I know Susan does every year.
可是今年  我想教他了解光明节012---but I think I want to take this year to teach him about Hanukkah.
也许我能教班012---And maybe I could teach Ben...
有关圣诞骷髅头和人怎么死亡012---...about the Christmas skull and how people die.
你可以在今年教班认识菲比012---You may need to use this year to teach Ben about Phoebe.
嘿012---Hey.
你知道他在里面吗  不知道012---Did you know he was in there? No.
我们回来多久了  大概半小时012---How long have we been home? About half an hour.
好极了012---Lovely.
老友记  第七季  第10集  节日犰狳（哺乳动物）012---Friends  S07E10  The One With the Holiday Armadillo
你知道我在想什么  我们结婚后  你要不要012---You know what I was thinking? When we get married, will you, uh...
改冠夫姓 "宾"012---...change your name to "Bing"?
不要012---No.
为什么不要012---Why not?
"宾" 很奇怪012---Bing's weird.
你们好   嗨012---Oh, hey, you guys.
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
猜猜怎么着了012---Guess what?
我房东刚通知我   我的房子快好了012---My landlord just called. My apartment's gonna be ready soon.
所以我很快就会搬出去了012---I guess I'll be moving out.
菲比  我会想念你的012---Aw, Phoebe, I'm gonna miss you.
是啊  你会很伤心012---Yes, you will be very sad.
我要告诉瑞秋这个好消息  你们还住一起吗012---I gotta go tell Rachel the good news. Oh. You'll be living together again?
是啊  为什么不呢   她和乔伊住得很开心012---Why not? Well, she's just so much fun with Joey...
我以为她还会   继续和他住在一起012---...I assumed she'd still be living with him.
为什么你认为她和乔伊住得很开心呢012---Why do you think she's having so much fun living with Joey?
没为什么   只不过她是012---No reason, except she...
这么跟我说的012---...told me.
真的她说了  她不和我住012---She said she didn't want to live with me?
没有  她没这么说012---No. No, she didn't say that.
我想你该和摩妮卡说说了012---I think you should talk to Monica now.
菲比  别担心  我确定她想和你住的012---Phoebe, don't worry about it. I'm sure she wants to live with you.
你确定你很肯定012---You're absolutely sure?
不  我打赌她大概会012---No, but I'll bet she probably does.
大概012---Oh, probably?
我不喜欢这个词012---I don't like that word.
我知道 "大概"真正的意思  是啊  是啊012---I know what "probably" really means. Yeah, uh-huh, yeah.
"你妈大概不会自杀"012---"Oh, your mom probably won't kill herself."
对不起  我不要把我和瑞秋012---You know. I'm sorry, but I'm not hanging my hopes...
住在一起的希望寄托在 "大概"上面012---...of Rachel and I living together on "probably."
人在这世上要自己照顾自己012---Y'know? You gotta take care of yourself in this world.
历史教训完全没用012---History teaches us nothing.
"宾" 现在不是那么奇怪了吧012---Bing doesn't seem so weird now, does it?
嘿  太好了  你在家012---Hey! Great, You're home.
猜猜菲比送我什么圣诞礼物012---Guess what Phoebe got me for Christmas?
鼓  不是  鼓012---Drums? No, drums!
嗨  请给我们两个墨西哥卷外带012---Hi, Could we get two burritos to go, please? Ha, ha.
抱歉  不过也没那么抱歉  因为你不用和他在一起生活012---I'm sorry. But not that sorry, you don't have to live with it.
我们用钱德宾的名字订了位子012---Um, we have a reservation under the name Chandler Bing.
好的  大约要等45分钟012---Okay, we'll have a table for you in about 45 minutes.
45分钟   我们《音乐人》的票是8点的012---Forty-five minutes? We have tickets to The MusicMan at 8.
抱歉   圣诞节是最忙的时候012---I'm sorry. Christmas is a very busy time, sir.
难道是因为墨西哥卷玩笑吗012---Is this because of the burrito thing?
你要给他钱  给他钱  那只是个玩笑而已012---You need to give him money. Give him money? It was a joke!
不  为了我们的位子  这种地方都是死要钱的012---No, to get a table! Places like this are always shaking you down.
每个人都要小费的   好吧   镇静下来012---Everybody wants to be paid off. All right, calm down, O'Malley.
我会塞些钱给他  可是你要不露痕迹012---I'll slip him some money. You've got to be smooth about it.
嘿  我可以不露痕迹012---Hey, I can be smooth.
听着  我们有点赶时间  如果能让我们早一点012---Listen, we're a little bit in a hurry, so, if you could get us a table...
排到位子  我会很感激的012---...a little quicker, I'd appreciate it.
当然  先生  好012---Of course, sir. Okay.
怎么样了   钱还在另一只手里012---How'd it go? Had the money in the wrong hand.
你会不会012---Hey, ahh, You don't feel...
想吐  会不会  不会012---...like you're gonna throw up? No.
我会  所以我们012---Well, I do. So let's...
班   你012---So, Ben, you, uh...
你知道快过节了  对不对012---You know what holiday is coming up? don't ya?
圣诞节012---Christmas.
对   你知道另一个节日也要到了012---Yeah, and you know what other holiday is coming up?
圣诞夜012---Christmas Eve.
对  但012---Yes, but also...
光明节也是012---Hanukkah!
你是一半犹太人  光明节是犹太人的节日012---See, you're part Jewish and Hanukkah is a Jewish holiday.
圣诞老公公有会飞的麋鹿012---Santa has reindeers that can fly.
对  但在光明节012---Right, urn, but on Hanukkah--
光明节是庆祝一个奇迹012---Hanukkah is a celebration of a miracle.
很多年前   有一群人叫做玛加伯人012---Years and years ago there were these people called the Maccabees.
好  对  是的012---Okay, that's right. Yes...
但在光明节  我们唱的是012---...but on Hanukkah, we sing, uh:
好  这不是在比赛012---Ha, ha. Okay, it's not a contest.
圣诞老公公什么时候来012---When is Santa coming?
这样好不好  今年我们不要圣诞老公公012---Well, how about this year, instead of Santa...
我们来庆祝光明节012---...we have fun celebrating Hanukkah?
没有圣诞老公公012---No Santa?
我不乖吗012---Was I bad?
不  不  你没有不乖  你今年很乖  班012---No, no, no, you weren't bad. You've been very good, Ben.
圣诞老公公生我的气  不是  嘿  嘿012---Santa's mad at me. No, hey, hey, come on.
班  圣诞老公公没有生你的气  好吗012---Ben, Santa is not mad at you, okay?
你是他最喜欢的小孩012---You're his favorite little guy.
所以圣诞老公公会来嘛012---So Santa's coming?
对012---Yes!
圣诞老公公会来的012---Santa's coming.
很简单   保持轻松012---It's easy. Just keep it casual.
说句好话  和他握手  塞钱给他012---Give him a kind word, Shake his hand and give him the money.
你怎么这么了解   我不知道012---How do you know so much about this? I don't know.
理查以前常这么做   是不是012---Richard used to do it, didn't he?
我们现在可能已经在喝汤了012---We'd be eating our soup right now.
可恶的小胡子012---Mustached bastard.
这些人刚走  快  给他钱拿座位号012---Okay, those people just left. Come on. Quick, give him the money and get their table!
对不起012---Excuse me.
我们赶时间   可不可以012---We're in a bit of a hurry. Can we please...?
你喜欢鼓啊012---So you like the drums.
真好012---That's great.
我本来还担心它们会造成012---Y'know, I was worried that they would create maybe...
你们之间无法忍受的居住状况012---...an unbearable living situation.
好吧  看来没有  好012---But, okay, well, apparently not. So, yay!
菲比  我们学会了一首歌012---Hey, Pheebs, check it out, we already learned a song.
准备好了1  2  3  4012---Ready? One, two, three, four.
塔奇拉012---Tequila!
真好玩012---That's fun.
来了012---Here you go.
谢谢  阿甘  放在这里012---Thank you, Gunther. Put her there.
用铜板就没有那么容易了012---Definitely not easier with coins.
谢谢  谢谢012---Thank you. Thank you.
菲比  嘿012---Hey, Pheebs. Hey.
给你  现在我只欠你49块半了012---Here. Now I only owe you $49.50.
菲比  嘿012---Hey, Pheebs. Hey.
如果你要送乔伊毁掉整栋楼的圣诞礼物012---If you want to get Joey a Christmas present that disrupts the entire building...
何不送更微妙一点的012---...why not something a little bit more subtle...
像是铁锤012---...like a wrecking ball...
或是把天花病毒散播在走廊上012---...or a vial of smallpox to release in the hallway?
不只是鼓的声音  每5分钟012---It's not just the drum noise. Every five minutes...
乔伊把鼓棒丢到空中012---...Joey throws his sticks in the air...
然后我就会听到  "喔  我的眼睛  天哪  我的眼睛"012---...and I have to hear: "Oh, my eye! Oh, God, my eye!"
烦死人了  对  谢谢你012---I mean, it's so annoying. Yes, thank you.
你看  这是正常人对鼓的反应012---You see, this is how normal people are supposed to react to drums.
菲比  你送乔伊鼓是为了烦瑞秋012---Phoebe, You got Joey drums to annoy Rachel...
好让她不想继续住在那里吧012---...so she wouldn't want to live there anymore?
可能有一点012---Maybe on some level.
乔伊  你知道你不用丢鼓棒的012---Joey, y'know that you could just not throw the sticks up in the air.
那样怎么能算是玩摇滚乐呢012---What is rock 'n' roll about that?
嘿  乔伊  送你另外一个礼物012---Hey, Joey, I got you another present.
等一下   先不要告诉我是什么012---Okay wait, Before you tell me what it is...
好  是什么012---Okay, what is it?
是一只012---It's a...
毒蜘蛛012---...tarantula!
天啊  瑞秋  抱歉  我在想什么012---God, Rachel, look, I'm sorry. What was I thinking...
送乔伊这么一个   恶心的  可怕的蜘蛛012---...giving Joey this big, gross, scary spider...
还用这么一个松散的笼子012---...in such a poorly constructed cage?
你在说什么啊   我喜欢012---What are you talking about? I love them.
我小时候就有一只   后来我的猫咪吃掉了它012---I had a tarantula when I was a kid. But it-it died, because my cat ate it.
然后猫咪也死了012---And then my cat died.
乔伊  这不是很酷吗012---But, Joey, isn't this cool?
在我身上吗  我觉得他在我身上  我012---Is it on me? I feel like it's on me. I got--
不是很可爱吗012---Oh, isn't that adorable?
乔伊怕蜘殊012---Joey is afraid of the tarantula. Oh.
他好可爱哟012---Ah, yeah, He's so adorable.
老天  他很好玩012---He's so much fun.
乔伊是最棒的  很高兴你在这里住得很开心012---Joey is the best, I'm glad you're having so much fun here.
什么   等一下012---What? Wait-wait a minute,
菲比  怎么回事012---Phoebe, What's the matter?
我们的房子好了012---Our apartment is ready.
你不高兴是因为012---And that makes you angry because...?
因为你很想和乔伊住在这里012---Because you'd rather live here with Joey.
你为什么这么想呢   摩妮卡和钱德012---Where did you get that? Monica and Chandler...
说你和乔伊住得很开心012---...said you were having so much fun here...
而且不管是鼓还是毒蜘殊   都不会改变这点012---...and apparently no amount of drums or tarantulas is gonna change that.
菲比  你送乔伊这些东西012---Phoebe? Did you get all this stuff for Joey...
是想让我不住这里吗012---...to try to drive me out of the apartment?
亲爱的  那你还不如送他一条鱼012---Honey, if you wanted to do that, you might as well just gotten him a fish,
你知道我有多怕鱼012---You know how fish freak me out.
鱼012---Fish.
这些都不重要  菲比  我们会住一起的012---It wouldn't have mattered anyway, Phoebe, you and I are, are gonna live together.
我们是室友  讲好的012---We're roommates, that's the deal.
对  可是我希望你想和我一起住012---Yes, but I wanted you to want to live with me.
可是  如果你在这里住得这么开心012---But okay, if you're having so much fun over here--
喔  和你在一起更开心012---Oh. It's so much more fun with you.
我们住一起时很开心  对不对  对啊012---We did have fun, didn't we? We did.
好玩的不得了  他们说如果我们想的话  今晚可以去看012---Oh, anyway, they say if we want, we could see it tonight.
好啊  好  好012---Oh, I would love to. Yay, okay!
好  好  好012---Good, good, good. Great. All right. Good.
摩妮卡要我让鼓声停止012---And Monica asked me to make the drumming stop.
好了012---Done.
嗨012---Hey.
你好  先生  要退还那件裤子吗012---Hello, sir. You here to return those pants?
不   这是我的裤子012---No, these are my pants.
喔012---Oh.
好吧012---0Kay.
需要什么   还有没有圣诞老公公衣服012---How can I help you? Um, do you have a Santa outfit left?
圣诞节前两天   抱歉012---Two days before Christmas? Sorry, man.
好吧  有没有什么算是比较圣诞节的东西012---Okay, look. Do you have anything, uh, Christmas-y?
我答应了儿子   不想让他失望012---I promised my son, and I really don't want to disappoint him.
拜托   你们一定有什么吧012---Um, come on, I…uh, you gotta have something.
我是佳节犰狳（哺乳动物）012---I'm the Holiday Armadillo!
我是圣诞老公公的朋友012---I'm a friend of Santa's...
他要我来祝你012---...and he sent me here to wish you...
圣诞快乐012---...a merry Christmas!
圣诞老公公怎么了  佳节犰狳（哺乳动物）012---What happened to Santa, Holiday Armadillo?
圣诞老公公没有空012---Santa was unavailable...
在这么接近圣诞节的时候012---...so close to Christmas.
请进   请坐012---Come in, have a seat.
你一定累坏了吧   大老远从德州跑来012---You must be exhausted, coming all the way from Texas.
德州  对   班012---Texas? That's right, Ben.
我是圣诞老公公的012---I'm Santa's representative...
西南州代表012---...for all the Southern states.
还有墨西哥012---And Mexico!
圣诞老公公要我来这里012---But Santa sent me here...
送礼物给你   班012---...to give you these presents, Ben.
或许这位小姐可以帮我拿礼物012---Maybe the lady will help me with these presents.
哇  谢谢012---Wow, thanks!
不客气   班012---You're welcome, Ben.
圣诞快乐012---Merry Christmas. Ooh.
还有光明节快乐012---And happy Hanukkah!
你也为光明节而来吗   因为我是一半犹太人012---Are you for Hanukkah too? Because I'm part Jewish.
你是  我也是012---You are? Me too.
因为犰狳（哺乳动物）是在沙漠里晃荡012---Because armadillos also wandered in the desert?
你想在走廊里晃荡吗012---You want to wander in the hall?
嘿  班012---Oh. Hey, Ben!
何不让节日犰狳（哺乳动物）012---What if the Holiday Armadillo...

你在这儿干什么012---What are you doing here...
怪乌龟人012---...Weird Turtle Man?

圣诞老公公   你有带礼物给我吗012---Did you bring me any presents, Santa'?
当然有  班012---You bet I did, Ben.
放在这里012---Put her there.
如果不是他的手太小   这次会成功的012---Well, it would have worked this time if his hands weren't so damn small.
呵呵呵012---Ho-ho-ho.
班  来开礼物012---Ben, why don't you come open more presents.
圣诞老公公   节日犰狳和我要在厨房里谈一谈012---Santa, the armadillo and I have a little talk in the kitchen.
我绝对想不到会说出这句话012---There's a sentence I never thought I'd say.
你在干什么012---What are you doing?
你告诉每个人说   你找不到圣诞老公公衣服012---You called everyone and said you were having trouble finding a Santa costume...
所以我向同事借了一件012---...so I borrowed one from a guy at work.
谢谢  可是你必须离开012---Thank you, but you gotta leave.
为什么  因为012---Why? Because...
我终于让他对光明节有兴趣了012---...I'm finally getting him excited about Hanukkah...
而你却正在破坏012---...and you're wrecking it.
可是我还没摇摇我的肚子呢012---But I didn't get to shake my belly like a bowlful of jelly.
抱歉   钱德   这对我很重要012---I'm sorry, Chandler but this, but this is really important to me.
好   我去还了这套衣服012---Fine, I'll give the suit back.

圣诞老公公  真的012---Santa, really?
是啊   可以吗012---Yeah, is that okay?
你爸爸有扮过圣诞老公公吗012---Did your dad ever dress up like Santa?
没有   那就可以012---No. Then it's okay!
班  圣诞老公公要走了012---Okay, Ben. Santa has to go.
说再见012---Say goodbye.
不要   他为什么要走012---No, why does he have to go?
因为圣诞老公公和节日012---Because if Santa and the Holiday...
犰狳（哺乳动物）012---...Armadillo...
如果在同一个房子里待太久的话012---...are ever in the same room for too long...
宇宙就会爆炸012---...the universe will implode!
圣诞快乐012---Merry Christmas!
不要  为什么不是犰狳走呢  我要圣诞老公公012---No, why can't the armadillo leave? I want Santa.
好  我放弃  圣诞老公公012---Fine, I give up. Santa--
圣诞老公公可以留下来012---Santa can stay!
我留下来012---Well, I'll stay...
因为我想听光明节的故事012---...but only because I want to hear about Hanukkah.
班   你要不要和圣诞老公公012---Ben, will you sit here with Santa...
一起坐下来听光明节的故事012---...and learn about Hanukkah?
好的  圣诞老人012---Okay, Santa.
谢谢  不客气012---Thank you. You're welcome.
好  来听012---All right, it's time...
光明节的故事了012---...for the story of Hanukkah.
很多年以前012---Years and years ago...
有一群人叫玛加伯人012---...there were these people called the Maccabees!
圣诞快乐012---Merry Christmas!
喔  看看这地方012---Oh, wow, look at this place!
真糟糕012---Oh, this is terrible.
他们改了很多地方012---They've made so many changes...
我感受不到我祖母的存在了012---...I can't even feel my grandmother's presence anymore.
喔   新的烛台012---Oh, new sconces!
我的天啊  怎么了012---Oh, my God! What?
记得你告诉我   你祖母要做一道墙012---Okay, remember uh, remember how you told me your grandmother put up that wall...
来隔成两间房   对啊012---...to make that into two bedrooms? Yeah.
你说怕房东可能会发现012---And remember how you always said you were afraid the landlord might find out...
把它拆了  对啊012---...and then tear it down? Yeah?
你真的不知道我说这些的原因012---Do you really not know where I'm going with this?
墙没有了  是一间大房间012---It left. It's one huge room.
哦  不012---Oh, no!
哇012---Wow!
看吧012---See?
我们必须要把墙弄回来012---Well, I guess we'll have to put the wall back up.
不行  因为新的天窗   有天窗012---You can't because of the new skylight. There's a skylight?
哇012---Wow!
我们该怎么办   要开始找新地方吗012---Oh. So what should we do? Should we start looking for a new place?
知道吗   我感受到了012---You know, I'm sensing...
我祖母可能不喜欢那样012---...that, urn, my grandmother would not be comfortable with that.
是吗012---Oh, yeah?
