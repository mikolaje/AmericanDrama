大家好  嘿  嘿012---Hey, guys. Hey.
你们觉得怎么样012---So, what do you think?
你是指什么   指什么012---About what? What?
你在开玩笑吗  好吧  我给你们一个提示  一个提示012---Are you kidding? Okay, I'll give you a hint. I'll give you a hint.
眼睛  不  你的眼睛  不012---Eyes. No, no. Your eyes! No.
钱德的眼睛012---Chandler's eyes!
我戴上了眼镜啊012---I got glasses.
你一直都戴着眼镜啊012---You always had glasses.
没有啊012---No, I didn't.
你确定012---Are you sure?
你不是戴着一副012---Didn't you used to have a pair?
圆形酒红色的眼镜   看起来有一点012---They were really round and burgundy, and they made you look kind of, um...
娘娘腔   对012---Feminine. Yes!
不012---No.
甜心  我觉得你很适合戴眼镜  看起来很性感012---Sweetie, I think the glasses look great. They make you look sexy.
真的吗   对012---Really? Yeah.
你不会也以为  我以前有戴眼镜吧012---You didn't think I used to wear glasses, right?
当然不会012---Of course.
老友记  第七季  第3集  菲比的食谱012---Friends  S07E03  The One With Phoebe's Cookies
你们要什么订婚礼物012---So what do you guys want for an engagement present?
没关系   菲比  我们不办派对了012---Oh, that's okay, Pheebs, we're not having a party or anything...
所以你们不必送我们012---...so you don't have to get us-Ah, buh-buh-buh! Heh.
如果有人想送我们礼物   我们不该剥夺他们的快乐012---If someone wants to give us a present, we don't want to deprive them of that joy.
知道该送他们什么呢  你该送一台便携式CD唱机012---Oh, y'know what you should get 'em? One of those little uh, portable CD players.
我已经有一台了012---Oh, I already have one.
但有人借走了   还把它忘在妇产科诊所了012---Unless someone borrowed it and left it at the gynecologist.
对  至于"那个人"  她指的是乔伊012---Yeah, and by "someone"  she means Joey.
我知道我想要什么了012---Hey, I know what I want!
是我们想要什么  甜心  不  你不会要这个礼物的012---What we want, honey. No, you don't want this.
我想要你奶奶的饼干食谱012---I want to have your grandmother's cookie recipe.
你是说那个巧克力碎片饼干的食谱吗012---You mean the chocolate chip cookie recipe?
对啊   我奶奶临死前012---Uh-huh, yeah. You mean the one that my grandmother...
要我发誓那个饼干食谱012---...made me swear on her deathbed...
绝对不能泄露给外人的012---...that I would never let out of our family?
快死的人都会胡言乱语的012---Dying people say the craziest things.
多年来我一直都想得到它   我想帮我的孩子们做饼干012---I've wanted it for years. I was gonna make cookies for my children.
我真的很难过   好吧012---Break my heart. Oh, all right.
我要当  能做出全世界最好吃饼干的妈妈012---I'll be the mom who makes the world's best chocolate chip cookies.
我们的孩子会是胖子   对吧012---Our kids are gonna be fat, aren't they?
你们好012---Ahoy! Hey.
驾帆船出海还好玩吧  太棒了  我开始喜欢驾驶帆船了012---How's the boat? Great! I'm finally getting into this sailing stuff.
这次你终于出海了012---Oh, so you finally took it out of the marina?
我为什么要那么做012---Why would I do that?
三个彪形大汉使出吃奶的力气   才把它漂在海上012---It took three guys to get the thing in there.
如果你不想开它出海   你在船上都做些什么呢012---If you don't sail your boat,  what do you do on it?
光是坐在上面就很舒服了012---Oh, it's great! It's a great place to just kind of sit...
什么都不做   喝喝啤酒   吃吃洋芋片012---...hang around, drink a few beers, eat some chips.
恭喜你终于找到了  能那样潇洒的地方了012---Well, It's good that you finally have a place to do that.
乔伊  如果你要的话   我可以教你驾驶帆船012---Y'know Joey, I could teach you to sail if you want.
你会驾驶帆船  对啊   我这辈子都在驾船012---You could? Yeah, I've been sailing my whole life.
我十五岁时  我爸就送了我一艘帆船012---When I was 15, my dad bought me my own boat.
你有一艘帆船   怎么了  他想要安慰我012---Your own boat? What?! What?! He was trying to cheer me up.
因为我的小马生病了012---My pony was sick.
你知道我在想什么吗   什么012---You know what I was thinking? What?
没事  我只是想这么做012---Nothing, I just like to go like this.
钱德  今晚你做什么  你有课吗012---Chandler, what are you doing tonight? Why, do you have a lecture?
没有啊  怎么了  那么我没事了  怎么了012---No, why? Then, free as a bird. What's up?
我爸想约你去打回力球012---Uh, my dad wants to know if you want to play racquetball with us.
太棒了  爸一定很喜欢你012---Wow, that's great! Dad must really like you.
他从来不会约人去打回力球   他没有约你012---He doesn't ask just anyone to play. Yeah and he didn't really ask for you.
他要约"小钱"   我猜他应该是指你012---He asked for "Chauncey." I assumed he meant you.
你纠正他了吗012---Did you correct him?
没有  我觉得那样子比较好玩012---No, I thought it would be more fun this way.
太酷了  或许你们每周都该这么做012---This is so cool, maybe this is something you can do this every week.
或者你也可以坐在走廊上012---Or you could sit on the front porch...
确定下垃圾桶不会被偷走012---...and make sure no one steals the trash cans.
他每周都会这么做012---He does that every week too.
你得让他赢   他最讨厌输了012---Just so you know, you have to let him win. He hates to lose.
没问题   要不我用左手打球012---Oh, no problem. Maybe I'll play with my left hand.
你不是左撇子吗012---You're not a lefty?
有人认识我吗012---Does anybody know me?
怎么了  菲比012---What's wrong, Phoebe?
我到以前的公寓去拿饼干食谱012---I just went to my old apartment to get you the cookie recipe...
那场该死的大火把它烧光了012---...and that stupid fire burned it up!
不  你为什么没有复印一份  把它放在防火的盒子里呢012---No! Why didn't you make a copy and keep it in a fireproof box...
而且要它远离起火点   至少一百码的地方012---...and keep it at least 100 yards away from the original?
因为我只是个凡人012---Because I'm normal.
那是我奶奶留给我的传奇012---That was the one legacy my grandmother left me.
我知道你要它当你的订婚礼物012---And I know you wanted it as an engagement present.
我们得送你们订婚礼物012---We have to get you an engagement present?
别担心  菲比012---Don't worry about it. Phoebe.
没有人送我订婚礼物012---No one got me an engagement present.
好  我没有食谱了  但这个给你012---Okay, here. I don't have the recipe, but here.
祝你们健康快乐012---I wish you health and happiness.
一块放了很久的饼干012---An old cookie?
不列出礼物清单   就会发生这种事012---See, this is what happens when you don't register for gifts.
我做了一些饼干  把它们冷冻起来   这是最后一块012---See no-no, I made a batch and I froze it. And this is the only one left.
我们不能收下它  为什么012---We can't accept this. Why not?
因为它很恶心012---Because it's gross.
不  等一下  我想我可以利用这块饼干搞出整个食谱012---No, wait. I think I can figure out the recipe from this cookie.
我在工作时常常这么做012---I do stuff like this at work all the time.
真的吗  真的  我想我应该可以做到012---Really? Yeah, I think I can.
喔  好啊012---On, yay!
好吧   罗斯  我们欠你一份礼物012---Okay, Ross, we owe you a present.
是两份   我订过两次婚012---Two! I've been engaged twice.
快来看看这个小丑012---Look at this clown.
他以为整条河都是他的012---Because he's got a bigger boat he thinks he can take up the whole river.
别挡路啊   大混蛋012---Get out of the way, jackass!
谁会把自己的船   命名为"海岸防卫队"012---Who names their boat Coast Guard, anyway?
因为他们就是海岸防卫队   那他们在这里做什么012---That is the Coast Guard. What are they doing out here?
海岸在那边的嘛012---The coast is all the way over there.
乔伊  别管那些船了012---Joey, just ignore the boats.
我们的课还没上完   好吧012---We're not finished with our lesson. All right.
我要帮你复习一下基本要点  准备好了吗012---I'm gonna go over the basic points just one more time, are you ready?
别麻烦了  瑞秋  我已经懂了  开始驾驶吧012---Come on, Rach. Not again. I got it, okay? Let's start sailing!
我想把船开到   那边有一船小妞旁边去012---I want to go over there where that boatload of girls is. Yeah, oh!
真的吗   你想要012---Oh, okay. is that what you wanna to do?
过去跟那些小妞鬼混012---You wanna go over and give a little shout out to the old, hot chickas?
好了  来吧   水手乔伊012---Okay, let's do that, Sailor Joe.
快问快答   这个叫什么012---Quick question, though: What's this called?
船绳   错了012---Uh, boat rope? Wrong.
要怎么把主帆升上去012---How do you get the mainsail up? Uh...
摸一下就行了012---Rub it?
不  如果我说我们要转向了  你该怎么办012---No. What do you do if I say we're coming about?
我会说  "随你转"012---I'd say, "Come again?" Ha, ha.
不  不   我知道   这一题我会做012---No, no, wait I-I-I know this one, I know this one. Uh, um...
时间到   现在你死了012---Time's up. Now you're dead.
我也聋了012---And deaf!
你继续开玩笑吧012---Okay, you just go on and make your little jokes.
如果你不知道自己在海上做什么012---If you don't know what you're doing out at sea...
你就会在海上丧命   听懂了吗   水手012---...you will die at sea. Am I getting through to you, sailor?
懂了  别只是说你懂了012---Yes. Don't just say yes.
这不是游戏  乔伊  你真可能会受伤的012---This isn't a game. Joey you can really get hurt out here!
你要注意听我说话呢   还是想找死呢012---Okay, So do you want to pay attention, or do you want to die?
我想从船上给钱德打电话012---I want to make a ship-to-shore call to Chandler.
我吃到了肉豆壳  真的吗012---All right, I definitely taste nutmeg. You do?
你没吃到吗   那就是专业人员012---You don't? Heh. Well, that's the difference...
跟外行人的不同点了012---...between a professional and a layman.
没错  专业人员很傲慢012---That and arrogance.
嘿012---Hey.
嘿   出海好玩吗012---Hey. How was sailing?
我不想谈这件事了012---I don't want to talk about it.
你们至少可以留一块饼干给我   不012---Y'know, You could've saved me a whole cookie. No-wait-no-no!
女人太无情了012---Women are mean!
我不敢相信012---I can't believe that.
现在我奶奶的传奇   就只剩下012---Now the only thing left of my grandmother's legacy is...
这一块碎屑了012---...this crumb.
祝你们白头偕老   婚姻美满012---I wish you a long and happy marriage.
嘿   怎么样012---Hey. How was it?
我玩得很开心012---Well, I had a great time.
但是小钱012---Um, Chauncey on the other hand...
让我来说吧012---I will tell the story.
我们相处甚欢   我放手让他赢球   他喜欢我012---It was going great. I let him win, we were bonding...
甚至说我可以叫他爸爸012---...he even said I could call him Dad.
他要你不能叫他什么012---And what did he ask you not to call him?
爹地012---"Daddy."
听着   事情是这样的012---All right look, here's the story.
我们打完球012---Well, we had just finished playing racquetball...
想去做三温暖012---...and we were gonna take a steam.
我走进蒸气室012---I walk into the steam room...
里面雾气弥漫012---...and it's really steamy.
于是我拿下眼镜   悲剧发生了012---So I take off my glasses, and that's when it happened.
你们在哪里012---Guys?
这边来   坐吧   孩子012---Over here. Have a seat, son.
嘿012---Hey!
我的天啊  钱德  我不敢相信  我知道012---Oh, my God, Chandler! I can't believe it. I know.
你在我爸大腿上跳艳舞012---You gave my father a lap dance.
他们为什么要把那里弄得雾气弥漫的012---Why do they put so much steam in there?
不那么做的话   那里只能叫做 "房间"012---Because otherwise they'd have to call it the "room" room.
为什么  为什么会发生那种事012---Why, okay? Why? Why did that have to happen?
别这样啊   没有什么大不了的012---Come on, it's not that big a deal.
那是没有什么大不了的012---Not that big a deal? There--
那会有一种异样的触感012---There was touching of things.
我知道你想跟我爸搞好关系012---Now, I know you wanted to bond with my dad...
但你一定要从他那个地方开始吗012---...but did you really have to bond to that part?
我相信爸不会在乎的  或许他只是会觉得很好笑012---Listen, I'm sure that Dad doesn't care. He probably thought this was funny.
他会把这个故事挂在嘴边好几年012---He'll be telling this story for years.
我就是不希望他这样012---I don't want him to tell this story for years.
喔   但他会那么做的012---Oh, but he will.
他还是会告诉大家  摩妮卡试图逃出减肥营的故事012---He still tells the story about how Monica tried to escape from fat camp.
我才没有逃跑012---I wasn't escaping.
那么你怎么会被卡在铁丝网上的012---Then how'd you get caught in the barbed wire?
我想要救一只松鼠012---I was trying to help out a squirrel.
你想吃掉他012---You were trying to eat it.
如果是你爸打电话来   告诉你这件事012---If that is your father calling to tell this story...
那么我们的婚礼就要取消了012---...then the marriage is off!
别这样啊   喂012---Come on. Hello.
对不起   你打错电话了012---I'm sorry, you have the wrong number.
我待会回你电话  爸   我爱你012---Okay, I'll call you later, Dad. I love you.
好了  我要去见你爸了012---All right, I'm off to see your dad. Oh, whoa.
你不会是穿的太多了吗012---Whoa-whoa, aren't you a little over dressed?
你最好确定  这次他会付你小费012---Yeah, and you better make sure he tips you this time.
我想说服他  别再提那件事了012---Look, I figured I would try to convince him not to tell the story anymore...
我想最好的办法   就是跟他面对面谈一谈012---...and I figured the best way to do that was face to face.
我说的 "面对面"  指的不是他的大腿012---And by "face," I don't mean his lap.
我说的"面对面"  指的不是我的屁股012---And by "face," I don't mean my ass.
你要送摩妮卡跟钱德订婚礼物012---Are you getting Monica and Chandler an engagement present?
我不知道   他们没有送我们礼物012---I don't know. You know, they didn't get us anything.
谢谢你012---Thank you!
嘿  嗨012---Hey. Hey.
嗨012---Well, hello.
我们什么时候再出航   伙伴012---So when are we getting back out on the water, matey?
我不知道水手是怎么说的   但我死都不要012---Oh, uh, I don't know the boat way to say this, but, never.
为什么   因为你在船上很凶012---Why not? Because you're mean on the boat.
什么   我只是想教会你012---What? I was just trying to teach you.
我的确长了教训   那就是瑞秋很凶012---Well, lesson learned. Rachel is mean.
对  对  没错012---Yep, yep, Yep, Yep, Yep, Yep-
我还记得她驾驶她爸的船带我出海012---I remember when she took me out on her dad's boat.
完全不让我插手012---She wouldn't let me help out at all.
对不起  我要你帮我  但你连动都动不了012---Excuse me, I wanted you to help. But you couldn't move your arms...
因为你穿了三件救生衣012---...because you were wearing three life jackets.
我们得敬畏大海012---You have to respect the sea.
乔伊  如果你觉得我很凶   对不起012---Look, Joey, I'm sorry if you thought that was mean.
但我要告诉你   我一点都不凶012---But I tell you something, that was not mean.
我爸才凶   以前在船上  他总会对我大吼大叫012---My father is mean. He used to yell at me all the time on the boat.
那才真的可怕   我是个很棒的老师012---It was horrible. I was being a really good teacher.
好老师会说   "把啤酒放下  猪头"012---Does a good teacher say, "Put down the beer, pinhead!"
好学生会在上第一堂课时  就喝掉七罐啤酒012---Does a good student drink 7 beers during his first lesson?
是六罐半012---Six and a half.
你把最后一罐从我手里敲掉   还记得吗012---You knocked that last one out of my hand. Remember?
我不希望你被船桨打中012---Yeah, I didn't want you to get hit by the boom.
它的确打中我了012---Well, it hit me anyway.
如果我能喝完最后一罐啤酒  或许不会那么痛012---And it would have hurt a lot less if I had finished that last beer.
对不起  我会试着小声点  不再对你大吼大叫012---y'know what? I'm sorry. I will try to tone it down and, uh, stop yelling.
你不会再使唤我  我不会再使唤你012---You won't boss me around? I won't boss you around.
你会对我很好  我会对你很好012---And you'll be nice? And, I'll be nice.
你会脱掉上衣   乔伊012---And you'll be topless? And I-Joey!
你希望我学会吗012---You want me to learn?
这是22号012---Okay, here's batch 22.
或许它们跟你奶奶的饼干味道很像012---Maybe these'll taste like your grandmother's.
我放了一些橘子皮  没有放肉豆壳012---This has a little bit of orange peel, but no nutmeg.
我们来试试尝尝吧012---Mm. Let's give it a shot. Ugh.
自从九年级后  我再也没做过这么多饼干012---I have not made so many cookies since 9th grade.
你为了义卖会做那么多饼干吗  不  那是我星期五晚上要吃的012---What was that for, Like a bake sale? No, just a Friday night.
这些饼干真的很好吃012---Mm. These are pretty good.
对  但没有17号好吃012---Yeah, but not as good as batch 17. Mm-mm.
17号是哪一块012---Which one was that?
你几乎快吐出来后  吃的那块饼干012---The ones we had after you almost threw up.
对  17号很好吃012---Oh, yeah, batch 17 was good.
我不喜欢16号012---I did not like batch 16.
我没事012---I'm okay.
好吃的还有剩的吗   我们可以好好研究一下012---Are there any more from the good batch? We could work off those.
对  我想17号应该还剩一块012---Well, yeah, I think there's one from batch 17 left. Uh...
16号  这是16号  别挡路012---Batch 16. Sixteen, people, get out of the way!
嘿  乔伊  你表现得很好012---Okay, Joey. Honey, you're doing really good.
我要你站到左舷边上去012---I just need you to step to the portside.
还记得   左舷是哪一边吗012---Remember? Remember how we talked about the portside?
当然记得   右边012---Oh, yeah. Right?
不012---No.
是左边   甜心  没关系   那一题太难了012---It's left, sweetie, but that's okay. That's a tough one.
为什么不干脆说左边就好了呢012---I don't know why you just don't say left.
好吧  到左边去012---Okay, go to the left.
左边012---Ahem, the left.
坐在那边012---Huh? Just sit over there!
看到没   你又在大吼大叫了012---Okay! Okay! You're yelling again. See that?
不  我很小声  语气充满了爱意  我没有大吼大叫012---Oh, no, no. Very quiet. Said with love, no yelling.
你知道吗012---Oh, y'know what?
既然我已经坐在这里了   我就要在左舷喝一罐啤酒012---Since I'm here, I'm gonna have me a little beer on the portside.
你看到我刚刚做了什么吗012---See what I did there? Ha, ha.
乔伊  风有点大   麻烦你把船绳拉紧012---Okay Joey, We're luffing a little bit, Will you tighten up the Cunningham?
你说了一堆我听不懂的话012---Whoa, you just said a bunch of stuff I didn't know there.
乔伊  别这样  我刚刚才教过你012---Joey, come on! We just went over this.
你教我的时候  有只乌嘴巴里衔着鱼飞了过去012---Oh, y'know, when we did that was when that bird was overhead with the fish in his mouth.
你看到了吗   好恶心  没有  我没有看到鸟012---Did you see it? It was gross. No! All right?! I did not see the bird.
没有看到鱼  也没看到形状像泰森的保丽龙012---I did not see the fish! I did not see the piece of Styrofoam shaped like Mike Tyson!
我没有看到   因为我忙着教你驾驶帆船012---I did not, because I was trying to teach you how to sail a boat.
很明显   那是不可能的012---Which obviously is an impossible thing to do.
够了  你在大吼大叫  而且你也没有脱掉上衣012---All right that's it! You're yelling, and I don't see you taking your top off.
我放弃了012---I quit!
你是什么意思  你不能放弃   为什么012---What do you mean? You can't quit. Why not?
你还没有学会  我不准你那么做  葛林家的人不会放弃012---Because you're not finished! I won't have it. Greens do not quit.
葛林家的人012---Greens?
我姓崔比亚尼  崔比亚尼家的人会放弃012---I'm a Tribbiani. And Tribbianis quit!
我的天啊012---Oh, my God. Wait.
刚刚我说  "葛林家的人不会放弃" 对吧012---Did I--? I just said, "Greens don't quit," didn't I?
我到底说了没有  说了  你还在对我大吼大叫012---Did I just say, "Greens don't quit"? Yes! And you're still yelling at me.
不  我没有对你大吼大叫  我是对你身边的空气大吼大叫012---No! No! No! I'm not yelling at you. I'm just yelling near you.
天啊   乔伊  我就跟我爸一样012---Oh, God, Joey. Oh, I'm my father.
天啊   真的太可怕了012---Oh, my God. This is horrible.
