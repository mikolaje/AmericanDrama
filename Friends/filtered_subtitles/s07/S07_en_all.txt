Hey, what's going on?
I found a note on my door, "Come to Monica's.
Bring champagne and a Three Musketeers bar"?
Yeah, I'll take that.
What's up?
Monica and I are engaged. Oh, my God.
Congratulations. Where is she?
I'm engaged! I'm engaged!
Yeah, She's been there for 2O minutes. I'm surprised you didn't hear her on the way over.
Oh, I thought it was a kid yelling, "I'm gay! I'm gay!"
Can I bring her in'? Oh no, Let her stay out there. It's sweet.
I'm getting married! I'm gonna be a bride!
Shut up.
No, I will not shut up, because I'm engaged!
Oh, big talk! Why don't you come here and say that to me? Huh, buddy?!
Yeah, My fiance will kick your ass.
Come on, apartment 20, apartment 20.
Okay, you get her in, you bolt the door, I'll be in the closet.
Friends  S07E01  The One With Monica's Thunder
Okay, wait, wait, wait. Okay, shh.
Okay. Um.
I just want to say that I love you guys so, so much...
...and thank you for being here on my special night.
Our special night.
It just wouldn't be my night-Our night...
...if you weren't here to celebrate with me-Us. Damn it!
It's okay, I want this to be your night too.
To Monica.
Come on, wait, stop it.
Okay, to Monica. To Monica.
So have you decided on a band for the wedding, because I'm kind of musical.
Yeah, honey, she just got engaged a couple of hours ago. I doubt she's had time to think about...
Speaking of chiming in, remember the time you burned down my apartment?
Yeah, you're on your own.
Y'know what we should do? We should all get dressed up and go have champagne at the Plaza.
Oh, okay! Yeah.
But I-I-I can't stay too long,
I gotta get up early for a commercial audition tomorrow. I gotta look good.
I'm supposed to be playing a 19-year-old.
What?
So when you said get up early, did you mean 1986?
You guys don't think I look 19?
Oh, 19! We thought you said 90.
Okay, everybody, let's go. Let's go! Okay.
Hey, is uh the rest of my candy bar around here?
Oh honey no, you ate it all.
I was afraid of that.
You know what shoes would look great with this ring?
Diamond shoes.
You're not getting dressed.
Know what I mean?
Yeah, but I don't think we have time.
There's gonna be a wedding.
You're gonna be the bride.
Two hundred people are gonna be looking at you in a clean, white dress.
Let's do it.
Chandler, it happens to lots of guys.
You're probably tired, you had a lot of champagne.
Don't worry about it.
I'm not worried. I'm fascinated.
You know? It's like biology.
Which is funny, because in high school I failed biology...
...and tonight biology failed me.
Check it out. Okay, I could play this while the guests are coming in, okay.
First time I met Chandler I thought he was gay
But here I am singing On his wedding day
Phoebe, no.
If you'd let me finish, it goes on to say that he's probably not gay.
You guys don't have this problem, you're made of wood.
Hey, you look great. Hey.
Oh, thanks.
You okay over there?
I don't know. You know? I feel a little...
You know what? Never mind. I'll be fine.
Don't worry about it. You're probably tired, you had a lot of champagne.
It happens to everybody.
Hey. Wow. Hi.
Happy Monica's Night. Well, thank you. You too.
Can you believe they are actually getting married?
Well, sure, but I get married all the time.
You okay? Yeah, I guess.
I mean, do-do you think we'll ever have that?
You mean "we," you and me?
Oh, no, no, no.
"We," you with someone, me with someone.
Good, you scared me a minute.
I know. Shake it off.
It's just because you and I, we were like a nightmare.
No, but there were some good times. No, absolutely. Y'know like there was...
Surely you can think of something good. Just give me a minute.
Oh, well, yes.
I can think of one good thing. What?
You were always good at the...
...at the, uh, the stuff.
Yeah, I...
I was good at the stuff huh?
Uh-hmm, yeah, yeah,I really liked your hands.
My hands? Yeah.
Yeah? Uh-huh.
Way to go, guys.
You were really good at the stuff too.
Oh, I know.
Hey, you know what we never did?
Oh, no, not that.
We never had bonus night.
A what? You know, bonus night.
Y'know, when two people break up, but they get back together for one night.
One night, just sex? No strings attached?
Yeah, yeah, we never had that.
No. No.
Okay, this is getting a little crazy.
Um, I mean...
...I'm sure it would be amazing...
but I...gotta say I really-really don't think it would be a good idea.
Y'know? I really ...
...really...
...don't.
‘Sup? 
Sup dude? 
Take whatever you want, just please don't hurt me.
You playing a little PlayStation, huh?
That's wack.
PlayStation is wack.
‘Sup with the wack PlayStation,‘sup?!
Huh?
Come on, am I 19 or what?
Yes, on a scale of one to 10, 10 being the dumbest a person can look...
...you are definitely 19.
Come on, really. How old?
Young. You're a man-child, okay?
Now get changed, because everybody's ready. And please, please, keep my underwear.
Oh, thanks. Okay.
Joe. Yeah.
You've had a lot of sex, right?
When, today?
Some, not a lot.
Well, it's just the reason I'm asking is because I had kind of a, uh--
I was unable to--
I mean I really wanted too, but I couldn't...
There, ha, hm.
There was an incident.
Don't worry about that, man. That happens.
It's happened to you? Yeah, once.
Well, what'd you do? I did it anyway.
Phoebe, come on, let's go.
Come on.
Why aren't you dressed yet?
I'm sorry, but I just wrote the best song for your wedding.
Check this out. No. Phoeb.
I'll tell you what, If you get ready now, I'll let you play.
Really?! Yes.
Oh that's so exciting! Thank you! Thanks, Mon.
Oh but Mon, if you touch my guitar again, I'll have to pound on you a little bit.
Fair enough. now go get ready. Okay. I'll get everybody.
Finally we can start celebrating my--
I'm sorry, apparently I opened the door to the past.
Okay, Monica, Mon. Okay, what you just saw--
Can I ask you just a little question? Why tonight?
What? See, I've been waiting my whole life to be engaged.
And unlike some, I only plan on doing this once.
So, uh y'know, maybe it's selfish, I'm sorry about it, but I was kinda hoping tonight could just be about that.
Oh, honey, but it is just about.. No, it's not.
No it’s not! No! No! Now it's about you and Ross getting back together. What?!
See yeah umm, you kind of stole my thunder.
Okay! Ho-ho! We did not steal your thunder because we are not getting back together.
Yeah, no, and nobody even saw. Yeah.
That's true.
Honey I swear it we just kissed. It was just a kiss.
You guys kissed?
What does this mean?
Are you, are you back together? Can I sing at your wedding?
Thunder being stolen.
Okay come on Phoebe, it's nothing. Monica, come on! Let's not make a big deal out of this!
It was a one-time thing. It doesn't even matter.
Oh, my God.
I cannot believe you guys are talking about this.
Problems in the bedroom are between a man and woman.
All right? Now, Chandler is doing the best he can.
I don't think that's what they were talking about. Joe!!
What a great night. Chandler can't do it, they kissed.
What? You guys kissed? This is huge.
No-no, it's really not huge.
People thinking it's huge has led Monica to believe...
...we're stealing her thunder, which we aren't.
We're still talking about it. aren't we?
That, and Chandler's problem.
Monica, listen, listen.
Would you feel better if we stopped talking about Ross and Rachel?
That would be lovely. You got it.
Now, I can pass for 19, right?
Yes, you can pass for 19.
Really? Yes.
Seriously? Seriously?
Seriously, no. Okay? You can play your own age, which is 31.
I'm 30!
Joey, you are not. You're 31.
Oh, crap!
So, the Plaza. We'll get some mai tais? Maybe no more for you though.
You know, I-I think that umm, I don't feel like going to the Plaza.
Why? Honey, Monica, this is ridiculous.
I don't want to talk about it. I don't. Especially with you.
Pssh. That is wack.
Yeah?
Okay, I think I'll play it at the wedding.
Yeah, well, we'll see if they actually let you play, huh?
I mean they tell you anything you want to hear, like...
 "You look 19."
Then they just take it away, like, "No, you don't."
Well, I don't think Monica won't take this away.
Wouldn't she? Would she?
Would she?
You ate my candy bar!
Guess who.
Hey.
Hey, I just realized we kind of left some stuff up in the air.
What do you think Monica mean when she said
"I don't want to talk," especially with me?
I mean, Why not especially you and me? We were both out there kissing.
Still thinking about it?
I'm serious. What did she mean by that? "Especially you."
Oh, who cares? I care.
And so do I.
Y'know what, I have to talk to her. Will you let me just get changed?
Okay, sure.
Am I going to let you watch me undress?
No.
I can't believe her. It's just so typical.
Now Monica, I know you're upset, but don't forget there is going to be a wedding.
You are going to throw the bouquet, and then a honeymoon.
Maybe in Paris. Paris?
We will take a moonlit walk on the Rue de la blah-blah-blah.
Keep talking.
Then we will sprinkle rose petals on the bed and make love...
...not just because it's romantic, but because I can.
I love you.
Okay, don't say anything, you might scare it away.
It's Paris. Who knows we're here?
Hi, Pheebs. What's up?
You said I could sing at your wedding, so I need a small deposit.
What? Y'know, just some good faith money to hold the date.
We're not giving you a deposit for our wedding.
Oh, I see.
They break your heart, don't they?
You know, I don't really need their permission.
Yeah! if you wanna sing at their wedding, well you sing at their wedding.
Yeah, and if you want to look 19, then you--
You got to do something about your eyes.
What?! What's wrong with my eyes?
They give you away. There's just-there's just too much wisdom in there.
Just put some tea bags on them for 15 minutes.
That'll get rid of my wisdom? Maybe 10 minutes for you.
Oh, give her the deposit, give her the ring. I don't care.
Yes? Monica, What did you mean when you said...
...you didn't want to talk to anyone, especially me?
What a great apology. And you accept it. Bye-bye.
No-no, seriously-seriously, what was the "especially me" part about?
Well, let's just say it's not the first time you've stolen my thunder.
Wham'?
Hey, here's a thought...
Monica, what are you talking about?
My sweet 16. Remember, you went to third base with my cousin Charlie.
Ah, third base.
It was all everybody at the party could talk about.
Monica, y'know what? The only reason I did that was because your party was so boring.
We had a caricaturist. Oh.
Whenever I get married Guess who won't be asked to sing
Somebody named Geller And somebody else named Bing
Monica, your sweet 16 was like a million years ago.
And yet, here we are doing it again.
Ugh, Monica I don't want to steal your stupid thunder.
Why else would you have made out with Ross?
Got me.
All right, easy mimey, the moment has passed. It ain't gonna happen.
I just thought it would be nice if I could have this one night.
I swear, I never wanted any part of your night.
No one was supposed to see us kissing.
Oh, is that why you did it the secret hallway where nobody ever goes?!
Uh, Rachel, I've been thinking.
I don't think us getting together tonight is such a good idea.
I'm calling it off.
Way to save your dignity, my man.
Mon, why, why would I ever want to take away from your night?
I don't know, maybe you feel a little resentful.
Maybe you thought you'd get married first.
Maybe you can't stand...
...that your formerly fat friend is getting married first.
Oh, wow, that-You know what? That is so unfair.
Y'know what? Now I want to steal your thunder.
Come on, Ross. Let's go have sex!
I can't believe you're gonna have sex on my engagement night.
Well, somebody should.
Look, if we're gonna do this--
We're not gonna do this, all right? She's just gonna think that we're doin’it.
I see, so everybody wins.
Who is it? It's Monica, open up.
Okay, Ross, stop it. Please, wait a minute.
Yeah, you like that, baby?
May we help you?
I just wanted to say I hope you do have sex tonight and I hope you get back together.
but I must warn you, the night you announce your engagement...
...I'm going to announce that I'm pregnant.
How is that ever going to happen?
All right Monica, do you want to know why I was with Ross tonight?
I know why. You don't.
Okay, why? Because! Because I was sad.
What do you mean?
Look, I am so...
...so happy for you guys.
But you getting married just reminds me of the fact that I'm not.
I'm not even close.
And I don't know, maybe I just wanted to make myself feel better.
I know that that's dumb, but you were so depressed...
...when Ross got married, you slept with Chandler.
I don't care, she slept with me.
Anyway, sweetie, I am so sorry I ruined your night.
I'm sorry I almost made you sleep with Ross.
I'm gonna take off.
Congratulations, man. Thanks.
And Rachel. Yeah.
What can I say?
You missed your chance.
From now on, the only person who's going to enjoy these bad boys is me.
We thought Phoebe would leave
But she just stayed and stayed
That's right, I'm here all night
And Chandler will never get--
Hey, here's a dollar.
Consider it a deposit. Please sing at our wedding.
Oh, thank you. Okay.
Now who will perform the ceremony?
Who will perform the cer--?
I'll pound on him in the morning.
Hey. Who wants French toast? Oh, I'll have some.
Me too. Eggs and milk in the fridge. Thanks.
Oh, what's the matter, honey? I don't know, My hand feels weird.
I guess it's because I'm engaged.
How long before it starts getting annoying? It starts?
Yeah, so let's actually get started on the wedding plans.
Okay. Already?
Yeah, we got a lot to do. We gotta think about the flowers...
...the caterers, the music...
Oh, I got some thoughts on the music... Oh wait Chandler, too many cooks...
Take it from me. All you have to do is show up and try to say the right name.
0Kay.
What in God's name is that? Oh, my God, the wedding book?
I haven't seen that since the 4th grade.
This baby has got everything. Take, you know, locations for instance:
First organized alphabetically, then geographically...
...then by square footage.
That is so smart. Ha.
Break it off. Ahem. Break it off, now.
Friends  S07E02  The One With Rachel's Book
And that should conclusively prove...
...that I had the idea for Jurassic Park first.
Now, let's take a look-Hey, Ross.
Phoebe, oh, my God, what are you doing here?
I need to talk to you. It's pretty urgent. It's about Monica and Chandler.
Oh, my God. Um, of course.
Uh, would you please excuse me for a moment?
Um, heh, do you know each other's hometowns? Why don't you...?
What's going on?
Well, urn, not much. But, I was just thinking that since those guys just got engaged...
...that maybe it'd be nice if they had some privacy.y'know?
So, could I just move in with you for a couple days?
Okay, yeah, sure. But what's wrong with Monica and Chandler?
Nothing. Why?
Phoebe, you said it was urgent.
Oh, yeah, it is. I'm going to the movies and it starts in like five minutes.
Do you realize I have a classroom full of students?
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm so rude. Does anyone want to come to the movies?
I haven't cleared the budget with my parents yet...
...but tell me how this is for music.
All right, urn, a string quartet for the processional, a jazz trio for cocktails...
...the Bay City Rollers for dancing...
Wait, that was for my 6th grade wedding.
Well, you couldn't get them anyway. Ian doesn't play anymore, and Derek...
Well, Derek is a name I shouldn't know.
Hey, Mon, do you have another pillow, you know, something a little snugglier?
Why are you napping over here instead of over at your place?
The duck. What, the duck?
What the hell did the damn duck do now?
Uh, well, he did not get sick somewhere in there...
...and it was immediately found and properly cleaned up.
Now, do I get to look at this book...
...or is it just for people who are actually involved in the wedding?
Of course you can look at it. Yeah, I want your opinion too.
Okay. Here you go.
What do you think about centerpieces? Centerpieces.
Roses or lilies? Definitely roses.
Well, I just think they're a bit more wedding-y, you know.
But lilies are the clear choice. Oh, my God, it's like one mind.
Guys, guys, you gotta let me nap.
I'm gonna get cranky.
Joey, there is a perfectly good couch across the hall.
Yes, it is perfectly good...
...and it is not one of the places the duck got sick.
What?
All right, I'm gonna go. Joey, what did the duck do?
I don't know, but he did not eat your face cream.
Hey, little buddy.
How you feeling? Aah.
What the hell is in that face cream?
That's so soft.
Pillowcases.
Oh, ah.
"Zelda looked at the chimney sweep. Her father, the vicar--"
Vicar?
"--wouldn't be home for hours.
Her loins were burning.
She threw caution to the wind and reached out and grabbed his--"
Whoa.
Whoa.
This is a dirty book.
Uh, Phoebe?
Oh, Ross, hi.
Phoebe, what are you doing? I'm sorry, I'm with a client right now.
Phoebe. Okay, let's talk outside.
Phoebe, you can't massage people in my apartment.
What's the big deal? I did it at Monica and Chandler's.
And they knew about it?
Okay, look, Ross, what is this really about?
Look, this is my home, and I want to be able to come and go whenever I want.
Okay. I will find someplace else to do the rest of my appointments.
I just don't know what the big deal is.
The big deal is I don't want naked, greasy strangers in my apartment...
...when I want to kick back with a puzzle-Beer, cold beer.
Hey, Joey. What are you doing?
Sweeping. Why? Does it turn you on?
No.
What if I was, uh, sweeping a chimney?
Joey, did you eat my face cream?
Where are you going? The vicar won't be home for hours.
Joey...
...where did you learn that word?
Where do you think...
...Zelda?
You found my book? Yeah, I did.
Joey, what are you doing going into my bedroom?
Okay, I'm sorry. I went in there to take a nap.
And I know I shouldn't have, but you got porn.
Hey-hey, You know what? I don't care. I'm not ashamed of my book.
There's nothing wrong with a woman enjoying a little erotica.
It's just a healthy expression of female sexuality...
...which, by the way, is something that you will never understand.
You got porn.
Hello. Hi, is, uh, Phoebe here?
Uh, no, no, she's out for the night. Oh, great.
Heh. Can I help you with something?
I don't know. Are you a masseur?
Yes, I am.
Great. Dad?
Thank you so much. I'll be back to pick him up in an hour.
So, Chandler, your parents must've been thrilled...
...when you told them you were engaged.
Oh, yeah. I should probably call them.
I remember when we first got engaged.
I don't think I've heard that story. Dad, really you don't--
Well, I'd gotten Judy pregnant.
I still don't know that happened.
You don't know how that happened?! Your dog thought my diaphragm was a chew toy.
What a sweet story.
At least you're not hearing it at your 5th grade Halloween party.
What? They wanted a scary story.
Anyway, we're really excited about our wedding plans.
and well I guess pretty soon we'll be making a big withdrawal from the Monica wedding fund.
What? You tell her, Jack. I can't do it.
What happened? You still have the Monica wedding fund, don't you?
We have it. Only now we call it "the beach house."
I can't believe you spent my wedding fund on the beach house.
We're sorry honey, but we just assumed...
...if you got married after you turned 30 you'd pay for it yourself.
You bought the beach house when I was 23.
Which means you had seven years of beach fun...
...and you can't put a price on that, sweetie.
We really do feel bad about this though.
We started saving again when you dated Richard.
But then that went to hell, so we redid the kitchen.
What about when I started dating Chandler?
Well it was Chandler! We didn't think he'd ever propose.
Clearly I did not start drinking enough at the start of the meal. Heh.
I can't believe there is no money for my wedding.
We might still have some if your father didn't think it was a good idea...
...to sell ice over the Internet.
It seemed like such a simple idea. Stupid, Jack. The word is stupid.
All right, enough. I don't want to hear about it anymore.
Good luck, Chandler.
Okay, now I'm going to...
...touch you.
Oh, that's soft.
I can't believe this. Do you think your parents could help pay for it?
I don't know.
My mother spent most of her money on her fourth wedding.
She's saving the rest for her divorce.
And any extra cash my father has, he saves for his yearly trips to...
...Dollywood.
What happened at dinner?
My parents spent the money for our wedding.
My God, what did you order?
Wait, there's no money? Well, this is terrible.
You guys are gonna have to get married in, like, a rec center.
Honey, it's gonna be okay. No, it's not gonna be okay. It sucks.
No swing band, no lilies. No, you know what? It's gonna be okay.
I mean, you don't need to have this...
...rustic Italian feast, you know?
And you don't need this custom-made empire-waisted, duchess satin gown.
You can wear off-the-rack.
Look, it really is gonna be okay.
The important thing is that we love each other and we're gonna get married.
Do you even understand what "off-the-rack" means?
Why don't you just pay for it yourself?
How? I don't have any money.
Well, I have some. How much?
Well, close to...
Whoa! Are you kidding me? What? How much?
It's enough for wedding scenario A. Really?
How great are you, you little saver? Heh.
The amount you have is exactly the budget of my dream wedding.
Oh, you guys are so made for each other.
Well, you're not suggesting that we spend all of the money on the wedding?
Uh,yeah.
Well, I've been saving this money for six years...
...and I kind of have some of it earmarked for the future, not just for a party.
Wow. Hello, Mr. Chandler.
this is the most special day of our lives.
I realize that, honey, but I'm not gonna spend all the money on one party.
Honey, um, I love you. Heh.
But, urn, if you call our wedding a party one more time...
...you may not get invited.
We can always earn more money, okay? But we're only gonna get married once.
Look, I understand, but I have to put my foot down, okay? The answer is no.
You're gonna have to put your foot down?
Yes, I am.
Wow. Money and a firm hand.
Finally a Chandler I can get on board with.
Hey,Rach. Joey.
Hey, Rach, do you smell smoke?
Uh-huh. I get it. Smoke, chimney, chimney sweep. Very funny. Ha, ha.
No, no, no, I'm serious. You don't smell it?
Something's on fire.
No, I don't smell anything.
Oh, you know what? It's probably just your burning loins.
Hey, what are you guys talking about? Nothing.
Mm, damn, this coffee's cold.
Hey, Rach, do you mind if I heat this up on your loins?
You know, I cannot believe you told him. Joey...
So I guess you bought that book after we broke up, huh?
Uh-huh, I did, because I wore out my first copy when I was with you.
Oh, yeah? Yeah?
Well, uh, when we were going out, I read tons of porno magazines.
What's up?
Ross, how could you do that to an old man?
Excuse me, ladies.
I'm sorry?
My massage client, Arthur.
His daughter called and said some guy that worked for me...
...gave him a really weird massage this afternoon.
I gave him an extremely professional massage.
He said you poked at him with wooden spoons.
Okay, so it wasn't a traditional massage.
But I did give him acupressure with a pair of chopsticks...
...and I gently exfoliated him with a mop.
Well, he's never coming back, okay? You just cost me $80 a week.
You know what? This is your fault. You didn't move his appointment.
Oh, it's my fault? You didn't have to massage him.
You could've sent him away.
You could've not rolled Tonka trucks up and down his back.
He said he liked that.
You're right, you're right. I'm sorry.
Dude, what are you massaging an old man for?
His daughter was hot. Gotcha.
Hey. Hey
Listen, urn...
...I've been thinking.
And it's not fair for me to ask you to spend all your money on our wedding.
I mean, you work really hard for that.
Well. Well, you work for that.
Look, I thought about it too.
And I'm sorry. I think we should spend all of the money on the wedding.
You do? Yeah, I'm putting my foot down.
Yeah, look, when I proposed, I told you...
...that I would do anything to make you happy.
And if having the perfect wedding makes you happy...
...then that's what we're gonna do.
You are so sweet.
Oh, but wait.
What about our--? What about the future and stuff?
Ah, forget about the future and stuff.
So we only have two kids.
You know, we'll pick our favorite and that one will get to go to college.
Have you thought about that? Yeah.
How many kids were we gonna have?
Uh, four. A boy, twin girls and another boy.
What else did you think about?
Well, heh, stuff like where we'd live, you know.
y'know? Like a small place outside the city...
...where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff.
Y'know, we could have a cat that had a bell on its collar...
...and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door.
Of course we'd have an apartment over the garage where Joey could grow old.
You know what?
I don't want a big, fancy wedding.
Sure you do. No.
I want everything that you've just said. I want a marriage.
You sure? Mm-hm.
I love you so much. I love you.
Hey, listen, when you were talking about our future, you said cat.
But you meant dog, right? Ha, ha.
Ha, yeah, totally. Oh, good.
Hello, Zelda.
Who are you supposed to be? The vicar.
Do you even know what a vicar is? Like a goalie, right?
Yeah.
Look, Joey, it's enough, all right?
You keep making these stupid jokes and these sleazy innuendoes...
...and it's just not funny anymore.
All right, I'm sorry. Rach, I'm sorry. Okay? I'm sorry.
Maybe I could make it up to you by taking you roughly in the barn.
All right, you know what? That's it. You want to do it? Let's do it.
That's right. I want to do it with you.
Been trying to fight it, but you just said all the right things.
Uh, I did?
Yeah, oh, I've been waiting so long to get on that body.
This body? Yeah, that's right.
Come on, Joey, sex me up.
Hey, you're starting to sound like the butcher's wife there in chapter seven.
Oh, come on, now. Don't keep me waiting. Get those clothes off.
But I would keep that helmet on, because you're in for a rough ride.
I don't want to. I'm scared.
Hey, guys. Hey.
So, what do you think?
About what? What?
Are you kidding? Okay, I'll give you a hint. I'll give you a hint.
Eyes. No, no. Your eyes! No.
Chandler's eyes!
I got glasses.
You always had glasses.
No, I didn't.
Are you sure?
Didn't you used to have a pair?
They were really round and burgundy, and they made you look kind of, um...
Feminine. Yes!
No.
Sweetie, I think the glasses look great. They make you look sexy.
Really? Yeah.
You didn't think I used to wear glasses, right?
Of course.
Friends  S07E03  The One With Phoebe's Cookies
So what do you guys want for an engagement present?
Oh, that's okay, Pheebs, we're not having a party or anything...
...so you don't have to get us-Ah, buh-buh-buh! Heh.
If someone wants to give us a present, we don't want to deprive them of that joy.
Oh, y'know what you should get 'em? One of those little uh, portable CD players.
Oh, I already have one.
Unless someone borrowed it and left it at the gynecologist.
Yeah, and by "someone"  she means Joey.
Hey, I know what I want!
What we want, honey. No, you don't want this.
I want to have your grandmother's cookie recipe.
You mean the chocolate chip cookie recipe?
Uh-huh, yeah. You mean the one that my grandmother...
...made me swear on her deathbed...
...that I would never let out of our family?
Dying people say the craziest things.
I've wanted it for years. I was gonna make cookies for my children.
Break my heart. Oh, all right.
I'll be the mom who makes the world's best chocolate chip cookies.
Our kids are gonna be fat, aren't they?
Ahoy! Hey.
How's the boat? Great! I'm finally getting into this sailing stuff.
Oh, so you finally took it out of the marina?
Why would I do that?
It took three guys to get the thing in there.
If you don't sail your boat,  what do you do on it?
Oh, it's great! It's a great place to just kind of sit...
...hang around, drink a few beers, eat some chips.
Well, It's good that you finally have a place to do that.
Y'know Joey, I could teach you to sail if you want.
You could? Yeah, I've been sailing my whole life.
When I was 15, my dad bought me my own boat.
Your own boat? What?! What?! He was trying to cheer me up.
My pony was sick.
You know what I was thinking? What?
Nothing, I just like to go like this.
Chandler, what are you doing tonight? Why, do you have a lecture?
No, why? Then, free as a bird. What's up?
Uh, my dad wants to know if you want to play racquetball with us.
Wow, that's great! Dad must really like you.
He doesn't ask just anyone to play. Yeah and he didn't really ask for you.
He asked for "Chauncey." I assumed he meant you.
Did you correct him?
No, I thought it would be more fun this way.
This is so cool, maybe this is something you can do this every week.
Or you could sit on the front porch...
...and make sure no one steals the trash cans.
He does that every week too.
Just so you know, you have to let him win. He hates to lose.
Oh, no problem. Maybe I'll play with my left hand.
You're not a lefty?
Does anybody know me?
What's wrong, Phoebe?
I just went to my old apartment to get you the cookie recipe...
...and that stupid fire burned it up!
No! Why didn't you make a copy and keep it in a fireproof box...
...and keep it at least 100 yards away from the original?
Because I'm normal.
That was the one legacy my grandmother left me.
And I know you wanted it as an engagement present.
We have to get you an engagement present?
Don't worry about it. Phoebe.
No one got me an engagement present.
Okay, here. I don't have the recipe, but here.
I wish you health and happiness.
An old cookie?
See, this is what happens when you don't register for gifts.
See no-no, I made a batch and I froze it. And this is the only one left.
We can't accept this. Why not?
Because it's gross.
No, wait. I think I can figure out the recipe from this cookie.
I do stuff like this at work all the time.
Really? Yeah, I think I can.
On, yay!
Okay, Ross, we owe you a present.
Two! I've been engaged twice.
Look at this clown.
Because he's got a bigger boat he thinks he can take up the whole river.
Get out of the way, jackass!
Who names their boat Coast Guard, anyway?
That is the Coast Guard. What are they doing out here?
The coast is all the way over there.
Joey, just ignore the boats.
We're not finished with our lesson. All right.
I'm gonna go over the basic points just one more time, are you ready?
Come on, Rach. Not again. I got it, okay? Let's start sailing!
I want to go over there where that boatload of girls is. Yeah, oh!
Oh, okay. is that what you wanna to do?
You wanna go over and give a little shout out to the old, hot chickas?
Okay, let's do that, Sailor Joe.
Quick question, though: What's this called?
Uh, boat rope? Wrong.
How do you get the mainsail up? Uh...
Rub it?
No. What do you do if I say we're coming about?
I'd say, "Come again?" Ha, ha.
No, no, wait I-I-I know this one, I know this one. Uh, um...
Time's up. Now you're dead.
And deaf!
Okay, you just go on and make your little jokes.
If you don't know what you're doing out at sea...
...you will die at sea. Am I getting through to you, sailor?
Yes. Don't just say yes.
This isn't a game. Joey you can really get hurt out here!
Okay, So do you want to pay attention, or do you want to die?
I want to make a ship-to-shore call to Chandler.
All right, I definitely taste nutmeg. You do?
You don't? Heh. Well, that's the difference...
...between a professional and a layman.
That and arrogance.
Hey.
Hey. How was sailing?
I don't want to talk about it.
Y'know, You could've saved me a whole cookie. No-wait-no-no!
Women are mean!
I can't believe that.
Now the only thing left of my grandmother's legacy is...
...this crumb.
I wish you a long and happy marriage.
Hey. How was it?
Well, I had a great time.
Um, Chauncey on the other hand...
I will tell the story.
It was going great. I let him win, we were bonding...
...he even said I could call him Dad.
And what did he ask you not to call him?
"Daddy."
All right look, here's the story.
Well, we had just finished playing racquetball...
...and we were gonna take a steam.
I walk into the steam room...
...and it's really steamy.
So I take off my glasses, and that's when it happened.
Guys?
Over here. Have a seat, son.
Hey!
Oh, my God, Chandler! I can't believe it. I know.
You gave my father a lap dance.
Why do they put so much steam in there?
Because otherwise they'd have to call it the "room" room.
Why, okay? Why? Why did that have to happen?
Come on, it's not that big a deal.
Not that big a deal? There--
There was touching of things.
Now, I know you wanted to bond with my dad...
...but did you really have to bond to that part?
Listen, I'm sure that Dad doesn't care. He probably thought this was funny.
He'll be telling this story for years.
I don't want him to tell this story for years.
Oh, but he will.
He still tells the story about how Monica tried to escape from fat camp.
I wasn't escaping.
Then how'd you get caught in the barbed wire?
I was trying to help out a squirrel.
You were trying to eat it.
If that is your father calling to tell this story...
...then the marriage is off!
Come on. Hello.
I'm sorry, you have the wrong number.
Okay, I'll call you later, Dad. I love you.
All right, I'm off to see your dad. Oh, whoa.
Whoa-whoa, aren't you a little over dressed?
Yeah, and you better make sure he tips you this time.
Look, I figured I would try to convince him not to tell the story anymore...
...and I figured the best way to do that was face to face.
And by "face," I don't mean his lap.
And by "face," I don't mean my ass.
Are you getting Monica and Chandler an engagement present?
I don't know. You know, they didn't get us anything.
Thank you!
Hey. Hey.
Well, hello.
So when are we getting back out on the water, matey?
Oh, uh, I don't know the boat way to say this, but, never.
Why not? Because you're mean on the boat.
What? I was just trying to teach you.
Well, lesson learned. Rachel is mean.
Yep, yep, Yep, Yep, Yep, Yep-
I remember when she took me out on her dad's boat.
She wouldn't let me help out at all.
Excuse me, I wanted you to help. But you couldn't move your arms...
...because you were wearing three life jackets.
You have to respect the sea.
Look, Joey, I'm sorry if you thought that was mean.
But I tell you something, that was not mean.
My father is mean. He used to yell at me all the time on the boat.
It was horrible. I was being a really good teacher.
Does a good teacher say, "Put down the beer, pinhead!"
Does a good student drink 7 beers during his first lesson?
Six and a half.
You knocked that last one out of my hand. Remember?
Yeah, I didn't want you to get hit by the boom.
Well, it hit me anyway.
And it would have hurt a lot less if I had finished that last beer.
y'know what? I'm sorry. I will try to tone it down and, uh, stop yelling.
You won't boss me around? I won't boss you around.
And you'll be nice? And, I'll be nice.
And you'll be topless? And I-Joey!
You want me to learn?
Okay, here's batch 22.
Maybe these'll taste like your grandmother's.
This has a little bit of orange peel, but no nutmeg.
Mm. Let's give it a shot. Ugh.
I have not made so many cookies since 9th grade.
What was that for, Like a bake sale? No, just a Friday night.
Mm. These are pretty good.
Yeah, but not as good as batch 17. Mm-mm.
Which one was that?
The ones we had after you almost threw up.
Oh, yeah, batch 17 was good.
I did not like batch 16.
I'm okay.
Are there any more from the good batch? We could work off those.
Well, yeah, I think there's one from batch 17 left. Uh...
Batch 16. Sixteen, people, get out of the way!
Okay, Joey. Honey, you're doing really good.
I just need you to step to the portside.
Remember? Remember how we talked about the portside?
Oh, yeah. Right?
No.
It's left, sweetie, but that's okay. That's a tough one.
I don't know why you just don't say left.
Okay, go to the left.
Ahem, the left.
Huh? Just sit over there!
Okay! Okay! You're yelling again. See that?
Oh, no, no. Very quiet. Said with love, no yelling.
Oh, y'know what?
Since I'm here, I'm gonna have me a little beer on the portside.
See what I did there? Ha, ha.
Okay Joey, We're luffing a little bit, Will you tighten up the Cunningham?
Whoa, you just said a bunch of stuff I didn't know there.
Joey, come on! We just went over this.
Oh, y'know, when we did that was when that bird was overhead with the fish in his mouth.
Did you see it? It was gross. No! All right?! I did not see the bird.
I did not see the fish! I did not see the piece of Styrofoam shaped like Mike Tyson!
I did not, because I was trying to teach you how to sail a boat.
Which obviously is an impossible thing to do.
All right that's it! You're yelling, and I don't see you taking your top off.
I quit!
What do you mean? You can't quit. Why not?
Because you're not finished! I won't have it. Greens do not quit.
Greens?
I'm a Tribbiani. And Tribbianis quit!
Oh, my God. Wait.
Did I--? I just said, "Greens don't quit," didn't I?
Did I just say, "Greens don't quit"? Yes! And you're still yelling at me.
No! No! No! I'm not yelling at you. I'm just yelling near you.
Oh, God, Joey. Oh, I'm my father.
Oh, my God. This is horrible.
I've been trying so hard not to be my mother, I did not see this coming.
Ugh, Joey.
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry. I just wanted you to learn.
Well, hey
I did learn.
Really? Yeah, come on.
No. Yeah. It's okay.
I know what a mainsail is. Huh?
I know, I know to duck when the boom comes across.
I know port is right. Left.
Damn it!
You know, I bet it would make my grandma very happy...
...to know that we're trying to figure out her recipe.
I bet she's looking up at us and smiling right now.
Looking UP?
Oh, yeah, no, she was really nice to me but she's in hell for sure.
Well, I've tried everything. I give up.
I'm not gonna be the morn who makes the world's best cookies.
I do make the best duck confit with broccoli raab.
Kids love that, right'?
Aw, Pheeb, come on isn't there any relative that would have the recipe?
What about, What about your sister?
Oh, no. I made a promise to myself that the next time...
...I would talk to Ursula is over my dead body.
And that's not happening until October 15, 2032.
That's the day you're gonna die? See.
Darn it, I've got shuffleboard that day. Heh.
That's what you think.
Well, What about friends of your grandmother? Would they have the recipe?
Well, You know, I may have relatives in France who would know.
My grandmother said she got the recipe...
...from her grandmother, "Nestley Toulouse."
What was her name?
Nestley Toulouse.
Nestle Toll House?
Ugh.
You Americans always butcher the French language.
Phoebe, is this the recipe?
Yes!
Oh.
I cannot believe that I spent the last two days trying to figure out that recipe.
It was in my cupboard the whole time!
I know! You see, it is stuff like this...
...which is why you're burning in hell!
So you understand.
I'd feel a lot more comfortable if you didn't tell people.
You know, I’m a little...I'm a little embarrassed about it.
I understand completely. There's nothing more horrifying...
...than embarrassing yourself in front of your in-laws.
As a matter of fact, when I started dating Judy, I was unemployed.
and her father asked me what I did for a living.
I told him I was a lawyer. Heh.
What'd you do when they found out? They never did.
So if you ever see me giving them legal advice, just nod along.
Shall we?
So, I guess we wear swimsuits in here.
Well, Joey, I hate to admit it...
...your way of sailing is a lot more fun.
Yep. Yep.
Hey, why don't you give a pull on that rope?
We're not sailing.
Just pull on it. All right.
Hey! Eh?
Sandwiches!
What else? Ha, ha.
Here you go.
Thank you. Oh, wow.
What are you doing? Oops. Sorry.
Don't hold it like that. You're letting all the good stuff fall out.
Oh. Oops. Careful!
You're wasting good pastrami!
Oh, my God. I'm my dad!
Well, if we learned one thing today, C.H.E.E.S.E.
is that cheerleaders and high explosives don't mix.
You can say that again, Mac.
Well, I couldn't have done it without you buddy. You're a genius.
Oh, yeah? Well, how come I can't get my VCR to stop blinking 12:00?
What did you guys think?
Hey, the phone. I got it. I got it.
Hello.
Hold on. Joey, it's your mom. It's Mommy.
Aw... That's nice.
Ma, so what did you think?
Well...
...that was, um, okay.
It wasn't the best.
That was one of the worst things ever...
...and not just on TV.
What should we say? The lighting was okay.
Ohh no you don't! You got lighting last time. Lighting is mine.
I have costumes.
Oh great! That means I'm stuck with:
"So we were watching you in there, and you were sitting right here. Whoa."
What are you gonna do Pheebs? I don't know. I don't know.
I can't lie to him again. Oh, no, I-No.
I'm just gonna press my breasts up against him.
And say nothing? Uh-huh, yeah, that's right.
Wow, my folks really liked it.
What did you guys think?
It wasn't that good.
Friends  S07E04  The One With Rachel's Assistant
Phoebe, do you think that your favorite animal says much about you?
You mean behind my back?
Oh, Hi you guys, oh my God! you'll never believe what happened to me today.
I am sitting in my office. You guys! You guys!
You're not gonna believe what my agent just told me!
Joey! Kinda in the middle of a story here!
Ooh, sorry. Sorry. You finish, go.
Okay, so anyway I'm sitting in my office, and guess who walks in.
I'm gonna be on two TV shows.
That's great.
Joey. You weren't finished?
Yeah, "Guess who walks into my office" is my story.
It was Ralph Lauren! Ralph Lauren walked into my office.
Uh Rach, if you're starting another story, at least let me finish mine.
It's the same story.
Uh, wow, it's really long.
Ralph just came in to tell me that he's so happy with my work...
...that he wants me to be the new merchandising manager for Polo retail.
Aw...
Still get a discount on wedding gowns? Yeah.
I'm so happy for you!
These really are the days of our lives.
What? Well, since you ask, ha, ha...
They want me back on Days of our Lives.
I got—I get a big Pay raise! Oh, hey!
I'll be playing Drake Ramoray's twin brother, Stryker.
I get to hire my own assistant.
Well-I got a head rush from standing up too fast.
And you were at this job for four years?
That's right. well this is all very impressive, Hilda.
Um, I just have one last question for you, uh...
How did I do? Was this okay?
What? I've never interviewed anyone before.
I've actually never had anyone work for me before.
Although when I was a kid we had a maid, but this isn't the same.
No, dear, it's not.
And I know that.
All right, well, thank you so much for coming in.
it was nice to meet you. Thank you! Good meeting you.
All right.
I'm a total pro.
Hello. Wow. Huh, um...
Hi, yes, I'm sorry. The models are down the hall.
Actually, I'm here about the assistant job.
Really?
Okay, well, then, all right. Well, just have a seat there.
Um, so what's--? What your name?
Tag Jones.
Uh-huh, go on.
That's it. That's my whole name.
That's your whole name. Of course.
Okay, let's just have a look-see here.
I know I haven't worked in an office before. and I really don't have a lot of experience--
Oh come on, What are you talking about? You got three years painting houses...
...two whole summers at T.G.l. Friday's.
It's lame, I know.
But I'm a goal-oriented person, very eager to learn--
Okay, hold on just a second. please.
I'm sorry, It's for Human Resources. Everybody has to. Would you stand up?
Ha, ha, no, no, no.
Hey. Shh, shh, shh.
Anyway, I should go. Okay. Bye.
Hey, sweetie. Hi, sweetie.
So, what was with all the whispering?
I can't tell you. It's a secret.
Secret? Married people aren't supposed to have secrets between one another.
We have too much love and respect for one another.
But still, no, ha, ha.
No I'm serious, We should tell each other everything. I don't have secrets from you.
Really? Okay, So tell me what happened to Ross, junior year at Disneyland.
Oh no-no, I can't do that.
If you tell me, I'll tell you what Phoebe said.
okay. okay
So, ahem, Ross and I are going to Disneyland.
and we stop at this restaurant for tacos.
When I say restaurant, I mean a guy, a hibachi, and the trunk of his car.
So Ross has about ten tacos.
And anyway, we're on Space Mountain and Ross starts to feel a little iffy.
Oh, my God. He threw up?
No, he visited a little town south of throw up.
So what was Phoebe's secret?
Um, Nancy Thompson, from Phoebe's old massage place, is getting fired.
That's it? I gave up my Disneyland story for that?
Hm, that's right. You lose, sucker!
Please still marry me.
Chandler, you have an assistant, right?
Did she call?
You told her I was sick, right? Always tell her I am sick.
No, I-I just don't know. How do you decide who to hire?
I mean I've got it narrowed down to two people.
One of them has great references and a lot of experience.
And then, there's this guy. What about him?
I love him.
He's so pretty, I want to cry.
I don't know what to do. Tell me what to do.
Come on, you know what to do. You hire the first one.
You don't hire an assistants because they're cute. you hire them because they're qualified.
No, I hear what you're saying and-and-and that makes a lot of sense but can I just say one more thing?
Look how pretty.
Let me see.
Oh, my God.
Oh. But, no.
No. You can't-You can't hire him because it's not professional.
Um, this is for me, yes?
Okay, you're right. I'll hire Hilda tomorrow.
Dumb, old, perfect-for-the-job Hilda.
Let me see this guy.
Wo-ha-ow!
Don't show this to Monica.
And don't tell her about the "Wo-ha-ow!"
Ha, ha, hey, Joey. Hey, Terry.
Nice to see you again. Been a while.
Wow, it's funny these halls look smaller than they used to.
It's a different building.
So...
...Stryker Ramoray, huh?
When do you want me to start? Why don't we start right now!
Here are the audition scenes.
Audition?  I thought you were offering me the part.
Why would you think that?
I was Doctor Drake Ramoray, Stryker's twin brother.
I mean, who looks more like me than me, right?
Everybody has to audition. Ha, ha.
You know, Terry, I don't really need to do this.
I got my own cable TV series...
...with a robot.
I'm sorry, Joey. that's...That's the way it is.
Well...
...I guess you think you're pretty special, huh?
Sitting up here in your fancy, small-hailed building...
...making stars jump through hoops for you, huh?
Well, you know what?
This is one star whose hoop--
This is the star the hoop-This hoop--
I was Doctor Drake Ramoray!
Hi, Tag. What are you doing here?
I just wanted to come by and thank you for not laughing in my face yesterday.
And I noticed there were no plants  in your office so I brought you your first.
There is a plant in your office.
Kind of.
Right.
So I guess I shouldn't put "good at noticing stuff" on my resume.
Thank you. Anyway...
Anyway...I'm guessing you hired somebody.
Well...
Gotcha.
Thanks again for meeting with me.
But I hired you.
What? Yeah, you got the job.
You're my new assistant. I am?
Yeah.
I can't believe it. Ha, ha, me either.
Umm, all right, first thing I need you to do is go downstairs...
...and find a woman named Hilda, and tell her to go home.
Hey. Hey, good, you're home.
Oh it's always nicer to hear than, "Oh, crap, you again."
Hey, sweetie, I made you a surprise.
Oh, yeah? Yeah, tacos.
Ever since you told me that story, I've had such a craving for them.
Did you not understand the story?
Hey. Hey, what's up?
Ah, nothing. Just trying to figure out what I'm gonna do for dinner.
Hey, ooh, what's that? Dinner stuff?
You making dinner? No.
What you got over there? Tacos?
No. No.
They're umm... They're just, uh-They're--
They're ground beef smileys.
Uh, those are tacos.
Excuse me, Mr. Mexico.
Either way, I'll pass. I still can't eat those.
What's so funny?
I'm not laughing.
You told her!
Nancy Thompson's getting fired.
Look, Okay, okay. I had food poisoning. It's not like I chose to do it!
It's not like—It's not like I said, "What would make this ride more fun?"
Right. You're right, I'm sorry. I shouldn't be laughing.
I should be laying down papers for you.
How could you tell her?! I had to okay?! We're getting married.
Married couples can't keep secrets from one another!
Oh really? L-I guess Monica should know about Atlantic City.
Du--ude!
What happened in Atlantic City?! Well, Chandler and I are in a bar--
Did you not hear me say, "Du--ude"?
And this girl is making eyes at Chandler. okay?
So after awhile he goes over to her and, uh, after a minute or two, I see them kissing.
You're thinking, Chandler's  not the type to go to bars and make out with girls.
And you're right. Chandler's not the type of guy ...
...who just goes to bars and make out with "girls."
You kissed a guy?
Oh, my God!
In my defense, it was dark and he was a very pretty guy.
Oh, Mon, I laughed so hard--
Ho-ho, so hard we had to throw out your underwear again?
Whatever, dude. You kissed a guy.
Hi. Hey.
Ooh, how's Hilda? Is she working out?
Oh, my new assistant is working out. Yes.
Was she happy you gave her the job?
My new assistant is very happy that I hired my new assistant.
Hello.
Oh, hey! Can you hang on a second?
It's the producers over at Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E...
...if you'll excuse me for a minute.
Hey, funny you should call. I was just looking over next week's script.
Canceled?
Like, they're taking it off the air? Oh.
All right, I'll see you Monday.
We're not even shooting them anymore!
All right. Bye.
They canceled Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.
Oh, sorry. Oh, I'm sorry Joey.
Why would they do that? It was a good show, right?
You want to tell secrets? Okay, Okay! in college...
...Ross used to wear leg warmers.
All right, All right! Chandler entered a Vanilla Ice look-alike contest and won.
Ross came in fourth and cried!
Oh, my God!
Oh, is that funny? Oh, You find that funny?
Well maybe Chandler should know your secrets too.
Ha, ha. Oh, I-I already told him everything.
You shush!
Once Monica was sent to her room without dinner...
...so she ate the macaroni off a jewelry box she'd made.
Ross stayed home every Saturday night to watch Golden Girls.
Monica couldn't tell time until she was 13.
It's hard for some people!
Of course it is.
Wow.
Chandler one time wore my underwear to work! Hey!
Oh, I'm sorry, I couldn't think of any more for Ross.
Ohh! Ohh! In college, Chandler got drunk...
...and slept with the lady who cleaned our dorm.
That was you.
Whatever, dude. You kissed a guy.
How could this happen to me?
Yesterday, I had two TV shows. Today, I got nothing.
Wait a minute, what happened to Days of our Lives?
Uh, well, they might be a little mad at me over there.
What happened?
Well, maybe I got a little upset, and maybe I told them where they could go.
Joey, why would you do that?
Because! They wanted me to audition.
You, an actor? That's madness!
Rachel Green's office.
Tag.
Hi, who was that?
Nobody. I was just practicing.
Really?
Hi. Hi, Rachel Green's office.
You must be Hilda. Ahem.
He's Tag. This is Phoebe.
Phoebe, can I see you for a sec'? Mm-hm.
Phoebe. Mm-hm.
That's a great name. You like that?
You should hear my phone number. Okay. We'll be right back.
So you hired yourself a little treat, did you?
All right I know, I know how it looks, Pheebs, but I am telling you--
But-but you know you can't get involved with your assistant.
Yes, I know that. I know that, and I know that hiring him was probably not the smartest thing that I've ever done.
But, from now on, I swear this is strictly professional.
Yes. Hey, Rachel.
Hi.
Cute assistant. What's his story?
Is he--? Gay? Yeah.
Hey, Terry.
Joey Tribbiani.
I'm surprised your big head could fit through our small halls.
I gotta go, Joey. Wait, Terry! Look, uh--
I'm really sorry about before.
I was an idiot, thinking I'm too big to audition for you.
You gotta give me another chance. I can't help you Joey.
Wait, Terry, please!
Look, I just lost my other job, okay?
You have no idea how much I need this.
Please, help me out.
For old times' sake.
This  poor guy's been in a coma for five years. It's hopeless.
It's not hopeless! Dr. Stryker Ramoray is a miracle worker.
Here he comes.
Good morning.
Drake, it's your brother, Stryker. Can you hear me?
And cut.
I'm back, baby!
You know, in my defense, um...
...there was no glitter on the macaroni and very little glue.
And in my defense, the cleaning lady came on to me.
You have no trouble telling time now right? No.
Quick, what time is it? I don't know! Time to kiss a guy maybe?!
What are you laughing at, Pampers?
You know when I said that because we're getting married
that we should share everything and not have any secrets?
Yeah? That was stupid. Let's not do that.
Absolutely.
And! We should keep all the stuff we told each other secret from everyone else.
Ha, ha. Yeah, definitely.
Okay, ha, ha.
Okay, If you'll excuse me, I'm gonna hang out with some people...
...who don't know the Space Mountain story.
Then I'd steer clear of Phoebe. Man!
Not that you would, but I wouldn't hang out with all the guys at my office.
Hi.
Do you have a minute? Well yeah, Sure. What's up?
I got asked out twice today while I was at lunch...
"by guys.
Really? Yeah.
Did you tell someone that I was gay?
Oh, did you not want people to know that?
But I'm not gay. And I especially wouldn't want you to think I was gay.
Why is that?
I don't think I should say. Oh, you can say.
Come on, I don't want you to feel like you can't tell me things.
okay. okay.
Well... Yeah.
...I'd love to ask out your friend Phoebe.
Yeah, she's gay.
Hey.
What's the matter? Someone on the subway licked my neck!
Licked my neck! Whoa! Willy's still alive.
What are you guys doing? My mom called.
They're gonna run our engagement announcement in the local paper.
so we're looking for a good picture of us. Ooh, I'm afraid that does not exist.
That's not true, There are great pictures of us.
No, there are great pictures of you standing next to a guy who's going like this...
Oh, my God, that's the creep that you're with at the Statue of Liberty.
I don't know what it is. I just can't take a good picture.
Oh, here's a great one.
Yeah, I'm not in that. No, I know, but look at me, all tan.
Why don't you guys go, get portraits done by a professional photographer?
That's a great idea. I bet they have one of those wind machines, Y'know.
Yeah, that's great. Next to that, Chandler won't look so stupid.
Chandler, what do you say? All right, but I should warn you.
I'm not going. I'm going.
Friends  S07E05  The One With The Engagement Picture
Dude, that reverse lay-up. Ugh!
And how about those three-pointers? Amazing.
And those guys were this close to letting us play this time too.
Hey, look. Phoebe's talking to Cute Coffeehouse Guy.
Oh, you guys call him "Cute Coffeehouse Guy"? We call him "Hums While He Pees."
Yes, and we call Ross "Lingers in the Bathroom."
Hey, you guys, "Hums While He Pees" just asked me out.
I thought that guy was married. He is, but he's getting divorced.
Ross, maybe you know him.
It's not a club.
Phoebe, If this guy's going through a divorce, is it such a good idea to start going out with him?
Hey, divorced men are not bad men.
They have that on the napkins at the club.
Oh, I gotta get back to work. You don't have to be back for a half-hour.
Yeah but, My assistant, Tag, does sit-ups in the office during lunch. Heh.
Ugh, I could just spread him on a cracker.
Rach, if you have a crush on this guy, why would you hire him?
I mean you know you can't date him, right? Oh, no, I know that.
Although we made a joke that we spend so much time together...
...he should call me his "work-wife."
Soon he'll be able to call you "that lady he knew that got fired."
I'm not gonna get fired, because I'm not gonna act on it.
So you wouldn't mind if he was dating someone else?
Why, is he? He is, isn't he? He's dating that slut in marketing.
Maybe I should open a divorced men's club.
Dude, that's so sad.
I could put a basketball court in the back. Heh.
Could I play?
Oh, no sit-ups today, Tag?
I just did them. Oh, well, drop and give me 1O more. Heh.
What?
I had a drink with lunch. Did those, um--?
Did those cost reports come in? Yeah, I filled them out last night.
Oh, great. Could you make me 4 copies of those?
Sure. Great, thank you.
Hey, Rachel. Hi. Hi, Melissa. What's up?
I'm just about to, urn, go out to the store.
to get some stuff to put in my backpack.
You know, like dried fruit and granola, and stuff like that.
Um, what's up? ls Tag here?
No. Why? Oh, I was gonna talk to him...
...about doing something tonight. Really?
You got a little crush on Tag there, do you?
Well, we've been flirting back and forth...
...but I was hoping that tonight it would turn into something a little more than that.
Okay, whoa, whoa. Easy there, Melissa. This ain't a locker room, okay.
But you know, I remember him saying that he had plans tonight.
Oh, no. Oh, yeah.
Oh yeah. All right, back to work.
Hey, isn't that Tag's backpack?
Yeah, Melissa, I don't want to be known as the, uh, office bitch...
...but I will call your supervisor.
Great, that's great, Monica. Great.
Now, Chandler, you want to give us a smile?
0Kay.
I'm sorry, is the seat uncomfortable? No, I am.
Chandler, I know you can do this. Okay? You have a beautiful smile.
I do? Yeah.
All right, maybe you don't have to smile. Let's try something else. Let's try, um--
Try looking sexy. Okay.
Or not.
Hi, Joey, what are you doing here?
I got an audition down the street, and I spilled sauce all over my shirt.
You got an extra one? Yeah, sure. Um...
Here.
Great.
You got anything that's not Ralph Lauren?
Yeah, I don't think so, Joe.
All right, I guess this'll be fine.
Hey, Listen, uh, what are you doing tonight? Nothing. Why?
How would you feel about taking out my assistant Tag?
I'll pay. Heh.
Huh, Rach I got to say it's gonna take a lot of money for me to go out on a date with a dude.
I'm not asking you to go on a date with him.
Really? Because I could kind of use the money.
Joey, just-He's new in town and he doesn't have any guy friends.
Just take him to a ball game or something. I'd appreciate it.
Yeah, okay, no problem. Thank you.
Ooh, hey, doughnuts! Uh-huh.
I know. Let's try a look...
...of far-off wonderment.
Okay, we'll-we'll gaze into our future and we'll think about our marriage and the days to come.
Chandler, what is the matter with your face?
I mean this picture's supposed to say "Geller and Bing to be married"...
...not "Local woman saves drowning moron."
Ha-ha-ha. Hey, don't laugh at him.
He's my drowning moron.
Aw. That's it, that's it! Take it, take it!
I like this one.
It seems to say, "I love you and that's why I have to kill you."
They can't all be bad.
Find the one where you make your bedroom eyes.
Oh, there it is.
Oh, my God, those are my bedroom eyes?
Why did you ever sleep with me?
Do you really want to pull at that thread?
I'm having a really good time. Me too.
Sorry that guy on the subway licked your neck.
No, that's okay. He's a friend.
Uh, I don't mean to be presumptuous...
...but I have these two tickets to the ballroom-dancing finals tomorrow night if you want to go?
Yeah, I--
Well y'know I-I mean I missed the semi-finals, so I think I would just be lost.
Heh, I know that it's lame, but I got these tickets from my boss--
Oh, no, no, no, my God!
Okay, don't freak out. I'll go. No, it's--
My ex-wife Whitney is out there.
I cannot deal with her now. That woman is crazy.
Okay, I know. Hold on.
Hey, Ross. Yeah.
Yeah. Urn, that's Whitney, Kyle's ex-wife out there.
Do you think that you can y'know divert her so that we can slip out?
What? No.
Okay, but I have two tickets to the ballroom-dance finals.
Look, I don't think so, Pheebs. I, heh--
All right, I'll do it.
But just because you're a friend. Okay.
Hi, Ginger.
All right! I want my key back.
I don't have it. It's right there.
Ugh. Okay, Sherlock.
Look, I'm sorry, but you'd better go, Pheebs.
All right. I just wanted to thank you though for diverting Kyle's ex.
Oh, yeah, no, you're welcome. We'll, uh, talk about it later.
Okay. Heh.
Hi, Whitney. Hi, Ross.
Are you ready for breakfast? Yep. Ooh.
Kyle's ex-wife? You were supposed to divert her, not date her.
Sorry, can you give me a second while I talk to this woman...
...uh, who, by the way, did not spend the night?
Sure. Okay. Eh, heh...
I did divert her, and we ended up having a great time, okay?
Watching ballroom dancing? Yes.
That's where we realized we are both super cool people.
Look, okay, Ross. Kyle just told me some really bad stuff about her.
Like what? Like she's really mean.
And she's overly critical and-And-No.
She will paint a room a really bright color without even checking with you.
0Kay.
And she uses sex as a weapon.
Fine. Thank you for warning me.
At breakfast, I'll be on full alert for room painting and sex weapons.
You're still gonna go outwith her? Yeah.
Well, didn't you hear what I just said?
Pheebs, come on. I mean, consider the source.
Of course her ex-husband's gonna say that stuff. Now if you'll excuse me.
No, listen to me, she is crazy!
Uh, your door isn't sound proof.
You see? Nothing is good enough for her.
Morning. Hi, Tag.
Hey, so did you have fun with, uh, Joey last night?
Yeah, we went to the Knicks game.
Aw, that's nice.
Then we went to this bar, and he hooked us up with all these women.
Women? You mean, like old women?
Kind of old, like 30.
Oh. And I never used to be able...
...to just talk to girls in bars...
...but I got, like, 20 phone numbers last night.
That's great.
Oh, man. So Joey must have really taught you some stuff.
A little. Yeah.
How you doing?
See? That's a great smile. Easy, natural.
Now pretend I have a camera.
You're changing it. I can't help it.
All right. all right, You want to know what I do when I take resume shots?
Borrow money from me?
Yeah. Okay, first of all, you want to make it look spontaneous.
So here's what I do. I look down, look down, keep looking down.
Then I look up.
See? All right, now you try.
Look down. You're looking down. Keep looking down.
Why is there jelly on your shoe?
I had a doughnut. Oh.
Hi. Hey.
So, I heard you had some fun with Tag last night.
Yeah, that guy's all right.
Yeah, and you had fun teaching him how to be all "Joey."
What? You know, all the women.
Hey well, You can't teach someone to be good with women.
Y'know, That's why I never had any luck with Chandler.
I'm right here.
All right, Would you mind just not going outwith him again?
Okay, just the idea of you and he and all these women--it's just
And I know he's my assistant, and I can't date him, blah!
but it just bothers me, all right?
No, no, no, you can't take him away from me.
I got a great partner to pick up girls with. Finally!
I'm still right here.
All right, will you at least talk to him...
...and tell him how hollow and unsatisfying this dating-tons-of-women thing is?
What?
I just don't want him to meet anybody until I'm over my crush.
And I will get over it.
It's not like I love him. It's just physical.
But—I mean I get these crushes all the time. Hell, I had a crush on you when I met you.
I know. Monica told me.
Did you have a crush on me when you first met me?
Yeah, sure.
Can you people not see me?
So will you talk to him?
I don't know, Rach. Oh, come on! I'll give you 10 Ralph Lauren shirts.
One.
No, 10. You said 10. You can't take that back.
Hey Joey, You wanted to talk to me?
I don't know. You, uh, got something for me?
Oh, yeah, this is from Rachel.
Ten. Okay.
Tag, there's such a thing as too many women.
Really? Yeah, for you.
Hey, there you are. There I am.
You okay? Yeah, Joey said I, uh, needed to relax.
So he gave me an antihistamine.
What? Yeah.
and then I fell asleep on the subway and went to Brooklyn.
Brooklyn is far.
Chandler, What were you thinking?
I don't know, But don't worry, because I know how to take a picture now.
Okay, see. Look down.
Look down.
Look down.
Chandler? Yeah?
Hi. Hi.
So how are things going with Crazy? Has she cooked your rabbit yet?
Listen, you are hearing one side of the story. Okay?
and FYI, she must have shown Kyle over 30 paint samples...
...before she painted that room.
And his response to each one was, "I don't give a tiny rat's ass."
Yeah well, maybe she should have spent a little less time decorating...
...and a little more time in the bedroom.
Well, I don't think we are going to have that problem...
...but maybe that's just because I am not emotionally unavailable.
You think he's emotionally unavailable?
I think he can be.
Well, Maybe he wouldn't be...
...if she didn't bring the office home every night.
Well excuse her for knowing what she wants to do with her life.
Well, she certainly knew what she was doing New Year's Eve 1997.
I knew you were gonna throw that in my face!
That was three years ago. She apologized and apologized.
What more do you want?
We want the last six years back!
So do we! So do we!
I'm sorry you had to see that.
Morning, Rachel. Hi.
Hey, so, uh, what'd you do last night?
Went out with Joey. Oh, yeah?
Another night of bird-dogging the chicas?
No, we had a really good talk. Oh.
I don't think I'm gonna do that bar scene anymore.
Wow, I did not see that coming.
It's just not really who I am.
Y'know, I've always been happier when--
Why am I telling you this?
You don't care about this stuff. Yes, I do. I do.
Go on. You were saying, "I'm happier when I'm--"
When I'm in a relationship.
I love having a girlfriend. Really?
Yeah. Someone I can spoil, you know.
Sp-Spoil? Uh-huh.
Let me ask you something. Uh-huh?
Do you believe there's one perfect person for everyone?
I'm starting to.
And if that person's in your life, you should do something about it?
Yes. Hell, yes.
All right, then, it's settled. Okay.
I'm getting back together with my ex. I would love to!
What?
Hello?
Oh. This is gonna be a while. Excuse me.
Um, yeah.
Yeah.
My God!
Oh, I'm sorry. Is that annoying?
And speaking of being selfish in bed, how's Whitney?
Well maybe she wouldn't have to be selfish in bed...
...if someone else knew where everything was.
Oh, he knows. Heh.
For the most part.
Oh, hey. Good, you're both here.
We kind of need to talk.
Both of you together? What's up?
Well, I went over to Kyle's last night to pick up a few things...
...and we got to reminiscing.
We talked most of the night...
...and we realized the reason we're angry with each other...
...is because there are still feelings there.
So...
Oh, just say it, Kyle!
We're gonna give it another try.
What about her whining, and her constant need for attention?
I'm gonna work on that.
Oh, right, because you're so capable of change.
You know, he hums when he pees.
I do know. Makes him miss the bowl, but whatever.
We're so sorry.
That's all right. We don't need you. I'm over it already.
Yeah, and I don't even give a tiny rat's ass.
Yeah, we're gonna go.
I'm sorry.
Pheebs, you were right about her.
You know, she did try to use sex as a weapon.
Yeah, I hurt my back a little.
You know, he hums while he does other stuff too.
We're better off without them. Heh.
And y'know, Even if they break up again, you better not let him in your sad men's club.
Divorced men's club. Potato, "potato."
Hey, guys, check it out.
My morn sent me the paper. Ooh, let's see it. Yay.
Oh, yeah, that looks good. You guys make a very attractive couple.
Yeah, we look great together. We really do.
0Kay.
Imagine what our kids would look like.
You know, we don't have to imagine.
I'm marrying her.
We'll just see.
Okay, the reason why I asked you guys out to brunch today...
...is because I have been doing some thinking about who should be my maid of honor.
Oh, my God. This is it. Oh.
I really hope it's you!
I hope it's you. Me too.
First of all, I love you both so much.
and you're both so important to me. Okay, Blah, blah, blah. Who is it?
Well umm, I was thinking that maybe we could come up with a system...
...where we trade off being maid of honor for each other.
Like hypothetically, if Phoebe were mine-Yes! Oh.
Hypothetically.
Still.
If Phoebe were my maid of honor. Rachel would be Phoebe's, I'd be Rachel's.
that way we all get to do it once and no one would get upset.
That's actually a pretty good idea. Yeah, I'll do that. So who gets to be yours?
Well, that's the best part. You guys get to decide.
Why is that the best part? Because then I don't have to.
Of course we'll help you decide. We'll do anything we can to help you.
I'd like to make a toast.
To the future Mrs. Chandler Bing...
...my best friend and truly one of the nicest people that--
Really not deciding. Fine.
Excuse me, I couldn't help overhearing.
You're marrying Chandler Bing? Yeah that's right.
Huh, Good luck!
Oh, and good luck to you too!
What a nice lady.
Friends  S07E06  The One With The Nap Partners
Yeah!
Die Hard, still great. Yep.
Hey, what do you say we make it a double feature?
What else did you rent?
Die Hard 2.
Joey, this is Die Hard 1 again.
Well, we'll watch it a second time and it's Die Hard 2.
Joey, we just saw it. And?
And it'll be cool to see it again!
Yeah! Die Hard! Die Hard!
Dude, you didn't say Die Hard.
Is everything okay?
Yeah, I just got uh, got plans.
Well, John McClane had plans.
No, see the thing is I want to get out of here before Joey gets all worked up...
...and starts calling everybody "bitch."
What are you talking about, bitch?
Hey, Rachel. Yeah?
When I get married, will you be my maid of honor?
Really?
Oh, my God, Phoebe. I mean, I'm just--
Wait a minute.
If I'm your maid of honor, that means that you are Monica's.
Oh.
Well, if that's what you want. Oh!
No way, Phoebe. I want to be Monica's.
But why does it even matter? Why does it matter so much to you?
Because this one is now.
And it's two of our best friends.
And who knows what you're gonna marry.
What-what if I marry Ross? Or Joey?
You wouldn't.
Okay, look, Rachel. I know you really want to do this...
...but I've never been maid of honor to anyone before.
I know you've done it at least twice.
Yeah, but, Phoebe. And no, oh please, oh please let me finish.
I guess that was it.
0Kay.
Okay. Since you've never done it before, you can be Monica's maid of honor.
Oh, thank you so much!
Yay.
I'm gonna marry someone good y'know.
Oh, I know.
Better than Chandler.
What happened? I don't know.
We fell asleep. That is all.
Yeah. Yeah? Yeah.
All right, well, I'd better go.
I think that would be best. Yeah.
I'll talk to you later. Okay.
But not about this. No, never. Never!
So, uh... Uh...
Bye. No touch. No touch.
Hey, a weird thing happened today when I was at brunch.
This woman overheard that I was marrying you...
...and she wished me good luck.
That's sweet.
No, it was more like a "good luck."
So, what did this woman look like?
She was like 30, dark hair, attractive.
Well, is there any chance you were looking into a bright, shiny thing called a mirror?
Come on, was it somebody maybe you dated in college?
No, no I only dated two girls in college...
...both blond, both not attractive.
Hold on one second. Let me check this out.
What are you doing? Well, let's see.
Okay, uh, is that her?
Oh, my God, yes!
Who is she? Julie Graff, my camp girlfriend.
Did you break up with her?
No, we're still together.
We went out for two summers and then I broke up with her.
Why? She came back the third summer...
...and she'd gotten really fa-aa-aw-ow...
Fat? I did not say fat.
I said "Fa-aa-aw-ow…"
You broke up with a girl because she was fat?
Yeah. Yeah.
But it was a really, really long time ago. Does she still feel bad?
Well, apparently she does.
You know what they say, "Elephants never forget."
Seriously, good luck marrying me.
Hey, what's going on?
Phoebe is gonna be Monica's maid of honor.
Hey. Well I hope it goes better than the last time you did it for that girl downstairs, remember?
You have been maid of honor before?
You see? This is exactly why you shouldn't lie.
All right that's it. I am maid of honor.
No, I am. How come you are?
Because I cared enough to lie.
Hey-hey-hey-hey, I could help you decide who should do it.
We could have like uh, like an audition
and see how you'd handle maid-of-honor-type situations.
What are you talking about? Like when I want a job...
...I go to an audition and if I'm the best of the people they see...
...they give me the part.
Okay, so after this audition, who decides who gets it?
Oh, me and Ross can be the judges.
It's better than us deciding. Oh, come on! this is crazy.
Can't we just flip a coin? No, coins hate me.
Okay, Okay fine, You know what? We will let Ross and Joey decide.
Hi!
Ross, sweetie.
Hey there, you handsome thing.
Wow, this cologne really is every bit as good as Giorgio.
Hey.
Just brought back your videos.
Hey, Ross. Look, I think we need to talk about before.
No. No, we don't.
Yes, we do.
Now, look. That was the best nap I ever had.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Come on, admit it.
That was the best nap you ever had.
I've had better.
Okay. When?
All right! All right! It was the best nap ever!
Ah! I said it, okay?
But it's over, Joey!
I want to do it again.
We can't do it again.
Why not? Because it's weird!
Fine.
You want something to drink?
Sure. What do you got? Warm milk and Excedrin PM.
Chandler.
Chandler! I just figured out who you are.
Can you figure out what I'm doing?
You're Louis Posen. Who?
Lewis Posin!  He was my best friend in fifth grade.
and-and then one day, I asked him to be my boyfriend and he said no.
Do you know why?
Because you kept talking to him while he was trying to go to the bathroom?
No, but because he thought I was too faaaaa...
And every time I think about it, I feel as bad as I did in fifth grade!
Y'know, I-I really think you should apologize to Julie.
Honey, are you kidding? That was like 16 years ago.
No, I know. But y'know what? It would make me feel better if Louis apologized to me.
Okay, I'll do it. But I warn you, this may make me a better person.
And that is not the man you fell in love with.
Okay, all right, this is how it's gonna work.
We'll give you hypothetical maid-of-honor situations.
and you will be scored on a scale of one to 10.
One being the highest. No, Ten is the highest.
Why is 10 the highest? Because it's the highest.
Okay, Rachel, you're up first.
Situation number one: You're with Monica.
The wedding is about to start when Monica gets cold feet. Go!
I don't want to marry Chandler.
I've got cold feet. It's gonna be okay.
No, One man the rest of my life? I don't know if I can do it.
This means I'll never get to sleep with Joey.
Look, Monica...
...getting cold feet is very common.
Y'know, It's just because of all the anticipation.
And you just have to remember that you love Chandler.
And also, I ran out on a wedding.
You don't get to keep the gifts.
Very good, drawing on your own experience.
Very good.
Yes, very nice, Rachel.
Thank you, judges.
Ugh, what a kiss ass. Oh.
Okay, Phoebe. Yes, Your Honor.
We're now in the ceremony.
Monica is about to say, "I do"...
...when her drunk uncle starts yelling.
What do you do? Go!
When Monica was a little girl...
...I remember that
Ow!
Very good! Oh.
Yes, excellent. Perfect score.
Wait a minute! She just made a scene in the middle of the ceremony!
Hey, Do you want a little taste of Pheebs?
It is time for you to give your maid-of-honor speech.
Ohh, wait a minute, We haven't even prepared--
Go! Okay, okay, okay. Um...
Umm, Webster's Dictionary defines marriage as--
Okay, no! Forget that! That sucks! Okay, never mind. Forget it. Urn, um...
I met-I met Monica when we were just a couple of 6-year-olds...
...and became friends with Chandler when he was 25...
...although he seemed like a 6-year-old.
Oh. That’s nice.
Thank you. Thank you very much. Um...
I've known them separately and I've known them together.
and-and to know them as a couple is to know that you are truly in the presence of love.
So I would like to raise my glass...
...to Monica and Chandler...
...and the beautiful adventure they are about to embark upon together.
I can think of no two people better prepared for the journey.
Wow.
Great speech. Yeah, it really was.
Oh, thanks.
Okay, Phoebe, I guess you're next. Although I really don't see the point.
0Kay.
I can't believe that Monica and Chandler are getting married.
I remember talking about this day with Rachel...
...while we were showering together, naked.
And she's back in the game!
Julie. Hi.
Chandler Bing. I guess you remember me.
Hello, Skidmark.
It's a nickname. I'll explain later.
It's pretty clear.
I owe you a long-overdue apology.
I shouldn't have broken up with you because you were overweight.
That's why you broke up with me?
You didn't know that?
Well, I guess my work here is done.
All right, well first of all, I would like to say you both performed very well,
okay? You should be proud of yourselves.
And I'd also like to say, that in this competition, there are no losers.
Well, except Rachel. Damn it!
Really? I won?
What? I'm sorry, Rash, it was, it was really close.
Well, then I demand a recount! Actually, it wasn't that close.
No! You know what? No! No! Your thing was so stupid anyway.
this was ridiculous, We're gonna flip a coin, all right?
Heads. Oh!
What? The coins have finally forgiven me!
Well You know what? I hope Monica forgives you after you throw her...
...her vegetarian-voodoo-goddess-circle-y shower.
Rach, it's gonna be okay. You guys are the best!
Boy, I tell you. That judging stuff took a lot out of me.
Yeah? Yeah.
I was thinking about maybe going upstairs and taking a little nap on my couch.
Why would I care about that?
No reason. I'm just saying that...
...that's where I'll be.
As bad as that went, I actually enjoyed myself.
I think that I'm going to apologize for all the stupid things that I do.
Why don't you just stop doing stupid things?
Then you wouldn't have to apologize. I'd love it if I could do both.
All right, I have to ask.
What?
Are you gonna break up with me if I get fat again?
What?
Well, you broke up with Julie Grath! How much weight could she have gained?
A hundred and forty-five pounds.
In one year?
My God, what did she eat? Her family?
That's not the point.
Look I know it was a stupid reason to break up with someone, but I was 15.
Yeah, well, that's not the only time this was an issue.
You remember when you spent Thanksgiving with us?
You called me fat.
Okay. Okay, now wait a minute
That was totally different. How?
You were not supposed to hear that. I said that behind your back.
What if I have babies, okay? I'm gonna look different.
I'm okay with that, but I'm not sure you are.
Look you have to realize I don't think of you as a thin, beautiful woman.
This is one of the things that I can apologize for later.
What I mean is, you're Monica.
Okay? And I am in love with Monica.
Keep going.
So you can balloon up or you can shrink down...
...and I will still love you.
Even if I shrink down to 2 inches tall?
I'd carry you around in my pocket.
I love you.
Skidmark still got a way with the ladies.
Hi, Pheebs.
Hi. Hi.
I just want to apologize.
I'm really sorry I was a baby.
That's ridiculous. Rachel, we were all babies once.
Oh, you mean today. Yeah.
Yeah, and you know, you deserve to win.
And y'know I was thinking about it.
If you're Monica's maid of honor, that means I get to be yours.
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
When Monica and Chandler got engaged, I put some stuff together.
y'know Just in case. Oh, that's so sweet. Thanks.
Here is a book of poetry that I know Monica loves.
Oh, God, this is funny. Look.
Here's a picture from one Halloween when she dressed up as a bride.
And look, She made me carry her train...
...which was weird because I was Wonder Woman.
Oh, and here's a little purse that I found.
Y'know I just thought that maybe they could hold the rings in there.
Oh. Something. And...
...vintage handkerchiefs, you know, because people cry at weddings.
I'm just gonna grab a couple of these.
This stuff is great.
I forgot this was in here.
This was the garter that I was saving for my wedding.
And I wanted it to be Monica's "something borrowed."
And it's blue.
Yeah.
Y'know Rach, I think that you should be Monica's maid of honor.
You do?
Why? Because I think it means more to you.
But, Pheebs, honey, you earned it.
It's fine. I mean, this is something...
...that you've been thinking about since you were, what, 14?
No, I was 10. I just developed early.
Man alive!
Hey, what's going on? Hey!
Well, we just decided Rachel is going to be your maid of honor.
Oh, that's great!
Oh, wow. Okay, we really have to start planning.
I have, I have really specific ideas.
We should probably get together like four times per week.
You can come over to my place, we'll get together before work.
What do you say, 6:30, my place? So excited!
Yeah, okay. You laugh now.
but she's gonna be yours.
Great nap.
It really was.
Dude, what the hell are you doing?
God!
Excuse me.
Morning. Hi.
Hi! Oh, How was your date last night?
Pretty good. Oh, good.
Aah! My God. Sorry about that.
Okay, really good.
Anyway I gotta go. I'm late for work.
What-what?! You're going to leave this person with me?
Hey, Don't worry, she's a terrific girl.
And hey listen, could you do me a favor?
When she comes out could you just mention that I'm not looking for a serious relationship? That'd be great.
Why?! What, are you kidding?
Just casually slip it in, you know. Lay the groundwork.
Tell her uh, I'm a loner. No, an outlaw.
she doesn't want to get mixed up with the likes of me.
Y'know what? That's a lot to remember.
Can't I tell her that you're a pig?
Hey, I'm gonna call her later myself.
Honest.
Oh come on, Chandler used to do it. He'd even make the girl pancakes!
Plus, He'd make extras and leave them for me.
Well forget it, I'm not telling that girl anything. It's not my responsibility.
Fine.
Now, where did we land on those pancakes?
Hi. Hi.
Sorry about that, but I couldn't get that lock to work on the door.
Yeah, Joey kind of disabled it when I moved in.
You must be Rachel. I'm Erin. Hi.
I don't mean this to sound like high school, but did he say anything about me?
Would you like some pancakes?
Friends  S07E07  The One With Ross's Book
Come on. Why are we here? Okay, okay, take a guess.
The hot chicks?
Okay, okay, I was typing names into the library computer earlier...
...you know, for fun.
And I typed mine in, and guess what came up?
My doctoral dissertation.
It's here! Yeah, It's right down here in the biggest library in the university.
Wow, that's actually pretty cool. yes.
There's also a book here by a woman named Wendy Bagina.
What is that?
Sounds like two people are really enjoying the Dewey decimal system.
We're so sorry.
You didn't bring me here to do that, did you?
She sent the chicken back again?
She said it's too dry now and she wants to come back here and explain to you how she wants it.
Well fine! I'd like to meet this chicken expert.
Send the colonel in.
Oh, my God!
Lucky bastard.
Janice. How are you...
...Ms. Hotshot-Chef-at-the-Big-Fancy Restaurant-With-the-Best-Chicken-Ever?
I'm fine.
Oh, what is that on your finger? I'm blind.
So who's the lucky guy?
Oh, my God.
I am so sorry, sweetie.
Are you okay?
You didn't tell her we were getting married, did you?
She saw the ring. Did she freak out?
She was shocked when I told her, but then again, so were most people.
Right
Well, She actually has a boyfriend y'know herself.
Name's Clark.
She also invited herself to our wedding.
Clark too.
You said no, right?
You said no, right?
Well, she cornered me. She asked me if the wedding was in town.
I mean, What was I supposed to do? Lie.
How hard is that? "Your check's in the mail."
"Oh, your baby's so cute."
"I can't wait to read your book, Ross."
Come on! So she comes to the wedding. Maybe it won't be so bad.
What do you think she'll sit quietly? You don't think she'll want to make a toast?
You don't think she'll want to grab the microphone and sing "Part-Time Lover"?
Oh, my God. She's not gonna like the chicken that night either, is she?
You know what? It'll be okay.
Y'know what? She's probably not gonna even want to come.
Really? No, that was a lie.
See how easy that was?
So you would have just lied?
Yes.
It would have really been that easy? Yes.
Good, so do it Saturday night because we're going to dinner with her and Clark.
Hey, what's up?
Hey. Hey.
Hey, who's your friend?
Hey!
Hey, Joey. Erin.
You're still here.
Yeah, We ended up spending the day together and had such a great time.
Why wouldn't you? Erin is great.
And then there's you guys.
Well, listen, I better get going.
Today was great. Thanks. I know.
0Kay.
And Joey, last night was fun.
Yeah. I'll call you.
I'll call you too. Or I'll call you.
And call me. Okay.
Good to see you again. Bye.
Bye-bye. Bye.
So the system kind of broke down, huh?
Oh Joey, I'm sorry. I just couldn't tell her all those things you wanted me to tell her.
And y'know we got to talking, and I--
We want you to marry her.
What?
She is so amazing. You have no idea.
No idea? Who do you think brought her here?
Cupid.
Joey, she's so cool. She speaks four languages.
Man, do you know what guys want.
Look Joey, Come on, she's so perfect for you. I mean She's sweet.
She likes baseball. She had two beers at lunch.
My beers?!
Look you guys, she's a very nice girl.
Okay. We had a very good time, but I just I don't see it going anywhere.
Yeah, but you always say that.
Maybe if you gave this girl a chance, it would go somewhere.
Look I'm sorry, you guys. I just don't think so.
Whatever. Fine.
Hey, don't start judging me.
You're the one who's in love with your assistant.
Huh? And you, You're the one having the affair with the guy who keeps pigeons on the roof.
Phoebe!
Secret affair.
People are doing it in front of my book.
I'm sorry?
My doctoral dissertation is in the library at school. I went to see it.
And there were students making babies right in the middle of the paleontology section.
Oh, my God. Did you get to see anything good?
Let me ask you something, at your school...
...was there a like uh a place on campus where students went to fool around?
Yeah, there was.
It was—there the corner of the library where all these dusty books that nobody ever read.
Yes, there was.
Great, because people kept showing up. I think it's like a thing.
Hold on a second.
Fifth floor, against that back wall?
Oh, for crying out loud!
All right, So we should go catch our movie. Well now what's the rush?
I'd like to see the previews.
The candy.
Oh, hey. Well, look who's here.
Hey, Joey. Hey, Erin.
Hey, Rachel. Hi.
We were  just about to take off and see a movie.
Oh, no! What's wrong?
Phoebe, we forgot that party we have to go to.
Oh, no.
What party?
A birthday party.
Whose birthday party?
Alison's birthday party.
Oh. And how old is Alison?
Thirty-two.
Wait a minute. Why don't you guys do something?
Yeah, Look how that worked out.
Excuse me. Hi, I'm a professor here.
Do you know the paleontology section, fifth floor, stack 437?
Well, yes. Just give me five minutes.
I just have to find someone to cover my shift.
No, no, no.
Can I speak to someone in charge please?!
How can I help you?
Hi, I was wondering, if it is possible to increase security...
...in the paleontology section?
I wrote a book that's up there.
And instead of reading it, people are...
Well, they're rolling around in front of it.
We are aware of the problem you're referring to.
But as far as increasing security, I'm afraid the library's very understaffed.
I can't help you.
Well, fine.
If I'm the only person with any appreciation...
...of the sanctity of the written word, then I'll go up there and defend it myself.
Don't you follow me.
Hey. Hey.
How did it go with Erin? Unbelievable.
We had the best time.
Oh so, you're not, you're not mad at us anymore? No, no. You guys were totally right.
This is so much better than the first time we went out.
Y'know? That was so awkward, We were both nervous.
Didn't you sleep together? Yeah, that really calms me down.
And we have so much in common.
She loves sandwiches, sports. Although she is a Met fan.
not much of an issue now, but if we had kids...
Oh, my God! Listen to you talking about having kids.
Oh, my Joey.
Please don't get married before I do. Oh.
I just cannot believe that Clark stood me up.
He may still show up.
What are you, stupid?
It's been three hours. Is that all?
Let's go on to happier things. okay?
Why don't you tell me about your lovely wedding?
Well actually uh, there was something that we wanted to tell you about the wedding.
It's going to be a small ceremony.
Uh, Tiny.
We're not even sure why we're having it.
It's actually we wants to be just family.
Oh, wait.
You two think of me as family?
Oh,  I have to ask you something now, and be honest.
Do you want me to sing "Careless Whisper" or "Lady in Red"?
How can you say that? The Mets have no closer.
What about Benitez? What about game one of the Series?
What about shut up? You shut up.
I love arguing with her.
Be right back. Okay.
So how's it going with Joey?
Oh, okay.
Okay?
Wait okay, tell me that you like him, please. I mean, tell me that you like him.
Look, he's a really great guy, and I know you really want this to work out...
...but I just don't see this having a future.
But you said that you liked him. I mean what happened?
Did you just change your mind?
Kind of. Then change it back!
I'm sorry. It's just there's no real spark.
No spark? Didn't you sleep together?
Yeah.
Ugh, tramp!
Does Joey have any idea?
I really I don't think he does. And you know what?
Maybe you guys could help clue him in. Y'know, tell him I'm not interested...
...in a serious relationship or something.
You mean, like, that you're kind of a loner?
Yeah, that'd be great.
And maybe that you're a real stronzo. I'm sorry?
Oh well, I guess Italian isn't one of the four languages you speak.
Hey. Want to go? Yeah, let's go.
Okay. See you guys later. Bye, guys.
Hey, thank you so much.
I guess it wasn't Cupid that brought her here.
No, just a regular old flying dwarf.
Yes, yes. How can I help you?
Yeah, we were...we were just looking around.
Oh, you're-you're fellow scholars.
What exactly were you looking for?
Perhaps--
Perhaps Dr. Chester Stock's musings...
...on the Smilodon californicus?
Get out of here!
Meeting someone?
Or are you just here to brush up...
...on Merriam's views on evolution?
Actually, I find Merriam's views far too progressionist.
I find Merriam's views far too progressionist.
I'm sorry. Who are you?
I'm a professor here. Ross Geller.
Ross Geller? Why do I know that name? It's a...
Wait.
Did you write this?
Yes.
You're the person who checked out my book?
You know, you look nothing like I would have thought.
You're so young.
Well, I skipped fourth grade.
I am very, very sorry.
Hey. Hey.
Hi.
So how was your date? Oh, it was great! We walked all around the village.
We went to this ice cream place. Split a milk shake.
Seventy-thirty, but still.
And guess what, I'm thinking of taking her upstate to one of those bed-and-breakfasts.
Really? She said she wants to go away with you?
No-no-no-no-no! it's a surprise. but it's gonna be tricky thought because she said she was gonna be pretty busy at work for a while.
Joey, look, honey, we need to talk, okay?
I got the feeling from her today...
...that she's not looking for a serious relationship.
Where are you getting this? She told me.
She said she's kind of a loner.
Oh.
Joey-Hey, Rach, it's cool, you know.
I'm a loner too, right?
Hey, Joey. You know what? You are way too good for her.
Yeah and honey I promise, next time I will just say good-bye and tell them you're not looking for a relationship.
No.
No, don't do that. Just...
Next time, make sure she really likes me. Well, that too.
Joey?
Yeah?
Do you want some pancakes? Finally.
What are we gonna do?
I say we go with "Careless Whisper."
Chandler?
Did she see us yet? Did she see us?
Janice, what are you doing here?
I thought I was gonna go back to my apartment...
...but then I just felt like I really couldn't be alone tonight.
I was just wondering if I could maybe stay here with you.
Just I really feel like I need to be with family.
Our kids are gonna call her Aunt Janice, aren't they?
Please. Because otherwise, I really don't know what I might do.
Aren't you just a teensy bit curious?
You have any tissues? Yeah, in the bathroom.
We'll just ...we'll just let her stay.
No-no-no-no, If we let her stay, she will stay forever.
Kind of like your Barcalounger. Is that what you're thinking about right now?
I never stop thinking about it.
Hey, you guys?
Do either one of you want to get in there before I take my bath?
Janice, I'm sorry...
...but you can't stay here tonight.
Why not?
Honestly?
Our apartment is a hotbed...
...for electromagnetic activity.
Monica and I have been immunized, but sadly...
...you have not.
I'm gonna to need a comforter.
Do you have a hypoallergenic one? Because otherwise I get very nasal.
Do you have a cat? Because it's already happening.
Eh. Do you hear that? Listen.
Oh, my God! Oh, my God! You have to go.
Why?
Because Chandler still has feelings for you.
He does?
Say again?
That's right. That's right.
And that is why you can't stay here tonight.
And probably why you shouldn't come to the wedding.
Feelings. Such strong feelings.
I mean, I realize that his feelings may never completely go away...
...but you can.
Oh, my God.
I understand. I am so sorry.
I'll go.
Goodbye, Monica.
I wish you a lifetime of happiness with him.
Chandler.
You call me when this goes in the pooper.
Don't sweat it, I've got this section covered.
Yeah, in fact, I've got this baby to shine in people's eyes.
Okay, see you later.
I just wanted to show Monica your book.
Hey, everybody. Happy Thanksgiving. Shh.
What, are we keeping Thanksgiving a secret this year?
No, we're playing this game I learned at work.
You have to name all the states in six minutes.
What? That's, like, insanely easy.
No, it's harder than it sounds. You always forget at least one.
Or in some cases, 14.
It's a stupid game and I wasn't playing against other people...
...so technically, I didn't lose.
You forgot 14 states?
Nobody cares about the Dakotas.
Oh, okay, time's up.
All right, I got 48.
Oh, that's not bad. Pheebs?
Oh, I got tired of naming states, so I decided to list the types of celery.
And I have one, regular celery.
Okay, so Rachel's got 48 and Phoebe has the lead in...
...vegetables. Joey?
Say hello to the new champ of Chandler's dumb states game.
Wow, how many you got? Fifty-six.
Friends S07E08  The One Where Chandler Doesn't Like Dogs
Hey, how is New England not a state?
Huh? They have a sports team.
Does South Oregon have a sports team?
There you go.
How come we have one extra place setting?
Because you invited your assistant. Oh, right, sorry. Tag's not coming.
His girlfriend came into town, so he's spending Thanksgiving with her.
Oh, why didn't you tell me'?
I made him his own individual sweet potato stuffed pumpkin.
Oh, well, I was going to, but then I figured, you know...
...your food is so delicious and perfect...
...you can never have too many of those pumpkin things.
You'd think I wouldn't enjoy that because it is so fake, ha, ha, but I still do.
Regular celery.
Oh, I already have that.
Done, with time to spare.
Ooh, this may be a new world's record. You know, I hate to lecture you guys...
...but it's kind of disgraceful that a group of well-educated adults...
...and Joey, can't name all the states.
You ever see a map or one of those round colorful things called a globe?
Uh, Magellan? You got 46 states.
What? That's impossible. Forty-six.
Well, who's well-educated now, Mr. I-Forgot-Ten-States?
I'm out of oven space. I'm gonna go turn on Joey's.
Please, watch him. Do not let Joey eat any of the food.
I am only one man.
Okay, time is up. Give me another minute.
Ross, if you don't know them by now, you will never know them, okay?
That is the beauty of this game. It makes you want to kill yourself.
This is crazy. I can do this.
All right, uh, I bet I can get all 50, uh, before dinner.
Okay, but if you can't, no dinner.
You're on.
All right, don't look at my list, because there's a lot on there that you don't have.
Hey, did you guys know your oven doesn't work?
But the drawer full of takeout menus is okay, right?
Ross, I'm gonna use yours, okay? Shh.
Chandler, give me a hand.
Sure. Joey, do not let Ross look at any maps or the globe in your apartment.
Don't worry, Chandler. It's not a globe of the United States.
Hey, you guys, I'm gonna go out and take a walk.
Phoebe, why is your bag moving?
Oh, it's not. Seriously, it's moving.
What the hell's in there?  It's just my knitting. That's all.
Yes, I knit this.
I'm very good.
Ross' apartment is nice. Why don't we hang out here more often?
I don't know. Maybe because it smells weird.
It's like old pumpkins or something.
That's my pie. Which smells delicious.
Uh-oh. Uh-oh. What?
We left Joey alone with the food.
Yep, yep, I knew it.
There he is...
...feeding stuffing to a dog.
Hi, Geller-Bing residence. How can I help?
Phoebe, why is there a dog in our apartment?
I'm sorry, who's this?
Phoebe, there's a dog sitting on my couch.
Tell her I'm allergic, and I will sue.
No, there's no dog here. Yes There is.
He's black and white and shaggy.
He's sitting next to Rachel and licking Rachel's hand.
Oh, my God. Where are you?
I'll be right there.
They're here already? How are they doing this?
Hi, Tag. What are you doing here?
I, uh, wanted to see if your offer to spend Thanksgiving with you was still good.
Well, sure. Come in.
Well, what happened to your girlfriend?
We, uh, kind of broke up this morning.
Oh, I'm sorry. Yeah, so she went back to Ohio.
Ohio, thank you.
Huh. Where's the dog?
What dog? There's no dog here.
Yeah, that dog left.
Phoebe.
Phoebe, open up.
There's no dog in here.
Phoebe, we can hear the dog barking.
No, that's just me coughing.
Oh, good. There you are.
Listen, urn, I have a dog in my room.
What is it doing here?
I'm watching it for friends who went out of town.
Wait.
Hello, my name is Klunkers.
May I please stay with you nice people?
Oh, I wish he could stay here, but Chandler's allergic.
Extremely allergic, okay?
If I am anywhere near a dog for more than five minutes...
...my throat will just close up.
That's odd, because this dog's been living here for the past three days.
Really?
If the dog has been here that long...
...and you haven't had a reaction, maybe you're not allergic to this dog.
Well, it still has to go, right?
Why?
Okay, it's, um-Don't do it.
Don't do what? I have to.
Okay? It's time.
Okay, I hate dogs.
What? That's crazy. Why?
Told you.
They are needy...
...they are jumpy, and you can't tell what they are thinking...
...and that scares me a little bit.
You're right. They are scary. Aah!
She just ate a treat out of my hand!
Wait a minute. Do you not like all dogs? I mean, not even puppies?
Is there a puppy here?
You don't like puppies? Okay, you are new.
Look, Chandler, I told you. Never tell anyone about this dog thing.
It's like Ross not liking ice cream.
You don't like ice cream? It's too cold.
Okay, it's just that dogs make me a little uncomfortable.
Hurts my teeth.
I don't wanna say this. I don't want you guys to hate me...
...but, uh, I don't think I can be around that dog anymore, okay?
So either the dog goes or I go. Huh.
Oh, my God.
How can I not get this?
I'm a college professor. I got 1450 on my SATs.
Twelve fifty.
Damn, I forgot you were here.
All right. We're gonna take Klunkers to Ross'.
We'll be back in a minute.
Oh, wait, before you go, can I ask a question?
Um, when a guy breaks up with his girlfriend...
...what is an appropriate amount of time to wait before you make a move?
Oh, I'd say about a month.
Really? I'd say three to four. Half-hour.
Interesting.
When it's your assistant, I would say never.
All right, Rach, the big question is, does he like you?
Right? Because if he doesn't like you, this is all a moo point.
Huh. A "moo" point?
Yeah. It's like a cow's opinion.
It just doesn't matter.
It's "moo."
Have I been living with him for too long, or did that all just make sense?
Please don't listen to Joey. Okay? Would you look at him?
He's obviously depressed. He's away from his family.
He's spending Thanksgiving with strangers.
What he needs right now is for you to be his friend.
Oh, you're right. I'm sorry. Thank you.
Okay, that's what I'm going to do. Fine, take their advice.
No one ever listens to me.
When the package is this pretty, no one cares what's inside.
Hey. Hey.
How you holding up?
Not bad. Yeah?
I'm sorry about your girlfriend. Thanks.
Were you guys together a long time? A year, on and off.
I thought we'd end up together. I don't anymore.
Now that she broke up with you. Yeah.
Hmm. It's weird.
I always used to assume that I would meet someone and fall in love and be happy.
That all that was just a given. Well, lately, it's like, what if it's not?
Do you ever have that feeling?
No.
Yeah.
All the time. Constantly. It's terrifying.
But, you know, then I figure it has to work out.
Why?
Because it has to.
You have all the answers, don't you? Yeah, I know, I do. I really do.
Hey, thanks for talking to me. Come on, what are bosses for?
Hug it out.
All right, he likes you back.
Huh? Told you you should go for it.
What?
Street noise drown any of that out?
No? All right, I'll see you later. Ha, ha. Okay.
What did Joey say? I like you back?
Uh, yeah-You know, well, see, he...
Joey knows that I'm very insecure about my back.
And... And you were hugging me...
...so obviously you are not repulsed by it. Yeah. Heh.
Wait a minute, that doesn't make any sense.
No?
All right, here's the truth. Ahem.
Joey said what he said because, urn...
...I'm attracted to you.
Wow. Yeah, I admit it.
I have a crush on you. And, uh, I know that's crazy because we work together...
...and nothing could ever happen.
And the last thing I wanted to do was freak you out...
...or make you feel uncomfortable.
Which is why it would be really great if you said something right about now.
Oh, my God. Those guys are stealing my car.
What? Right there. That's my car.
Hey! Okay, that's gonna take a minute.
Do you have anything else you wanna get off your chest?
I can't believe this.
Wait, we still have time to talk, and they're not even in the car yet.
Oh, look, there they go. Okay.
Okay, Phoebe. We should probably go back now.
Please, don't leave me. I'll be lonely.
Stop it. Stop.
Okay, let's go. We can be strong. Yeah, okay.
Oh, my God, did you hear that? She said "Monica."
Oh, I can't leave her.
If you want, we could sneak the dog back in and Chandler wouldn't even know.
That's not gonna work.
I had that dog there for three days and Chandler had no idea.
He's not so smart.
Hey. I didn't know either.
Yeah, but you kind of knew that something was going on, didn't you?
Yeah, I knew. Heh.
Where's Chandler?
Here I am. Wash your hands.
How did you know?
Hey, what's she doing back here?
Relax, Ross. She's not made of ice cream.
Hey, look, Phoebe. I, uh, laid out the states geographically.
No, no, we don't have time for this.
We have to keep Chandler away from my room.
Yeah, but, look what I--
See, this is exactly what we do not have time for.
Where's Monica? Uh, in Phoebe's room. You can't go in.
Why not?
Monica's crying.
She's very upset about this whole Klunkers thing.
Well, I should go in there. No, no.
No, she doesn't want to see you right now.
Why not? Because you sent away the dog.
That's ridiculous. Oh, is it? Is it?
Look, when Monica and I were kids, we had a dog named Rover.
And, um, one day, my dad decides he doesn't like dogs.
So Monica and her friend...Phyllis...
...take away the dog, and that was the last time we ever saw him.
Don't you see? This is just like that...
...only with a few details changed.
Okay, I'm in my sweatpants.
Bring on the food.
What's the matter? Monica's all upset...
...because I sent Klunkers away.
So? Bring the dog back. You're a hero.
Yeah, I could be a hero. I could do that. I could. I could do...
What if it--? What if it attacks me?
Chandler, it's like a big gerbil.
And that doesn't scare you?
Ross, you need some help?
From you?
Yes, please.
First of all, Utah?
Dude, you can't just make stuff up.
I hate America.
When I finish this game, I swear I am moving.
Hey. Tag still talking to the police? Yeah.
Ugh, damn it. Why did I open my mouth?
"I have a crush on you. I'm attracted to you."
I know that I freaked him out.
If you said it like that, you probably did, yeah.
Hey, is Chandler here?
Uh, no, no, he went for a walk.
Okay, well, you cannot tell him, but look who's back.
Hi. Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
He went over to Ross' to bring the dog back here.
Oh, no, the dog's not going to be there.
You think?
Hi, honey.
Please, please, please, don't be mad at me.
What? Why would--? Shh. Wait and see.
Maybe we will, maybe we won't.
Okay, I went over to Ross' apartment to bring back Klunkers, you know, for you...
...and, ahem, I left the door open, and she must've gotten out.
And I looked everywhere, all over the apartment, including the roof.
Which, FYI, Ross, one of your neighbors, growing weed.
I couldn't find him...
...and I am so, so, so sorry.
But I do know where we can all go ease the pain.
We have good news. Look who's back.
Hi.
Klunkers. Oh, my God.
That's right. She came back all by herself. It's a Thanksgiving miracle.
It is so good to see you.
Yeah, she came all the way back from Ross' building.
Oh, the things she must've seen.
Then she climbed up the fire escape...
...and she tapped on the window with her teeny little paw...
...and we ran to let her in.
I went too far, didn't I?
When should I have stopped?
Okay, maybe this is so hard because there aren't 5O states.
Let me tell you something. I have 49 states.
Now, there are no more.
Now, I think I should be able to eat something.
It's up to you.
Oh, hi. How are you doing? I'm okay.
I gotta go down to the police station and look at mug shots.
Thanks for having me over, you guys. Tag, you're going? Uh...
We didn't, uh, get a chance to talk.
So where did you say you're from again?
Colorado. Ah, what good are you?
Look, urn, I think we should talk about what happened on the terrace.
Okay. Uh...
I never should've said what I said.
You know what? It just doesn't matter how I feel.
We work together, so nothing could really ever happen between us.
What I would love is just to go to work on Monday and never talk about this again.
Okay? Big day, Monday. Lots to do.
So we okay?
Um, I'm not.
Oh, God, I knew it. I freaked you out. No, you didn't.
The only thing that freaked me out was you saying...
...that nothing could happen between us.
Really? Yeah.
So please don't fire me for doing this.
Okay, well, that's one less thing we have to do on Monday.
Delaware.
Delaware.
All right. I want my turkey now.
You got it.
You got Nevada twice.
I know. Yeah.
I'm ready.
You sure? Uh-huh.
Okay, let me just straighten out your helmet there.
Thanks, Daddy. No, no. One daddy, two mommies.
All right, it's all yours. Okay, okay.
There you go, there you go.
Wow, Ben's first big kid's bike. This is so exciting.
Oh, yeah, I remember mine.
It was my sixth birthday. My dad took me to the park...
...and I got on it and...it bent. Yeah.
I never had a bike of my own. What?
Well, we didn't have a lot of money.
But the girl across the street had the best bike.
It was pink and it had rainbow-colored tassels hanging off the handle grips...
...and-and-and a bell, and this big, white wicker basket...
...with those plastic daisies stuck on.
That sounds like my first bike.
My dad gave me his old one.
Did the girl ever let you ride it? No.
But she gave me the box that it came in.
It had a picture of the bike on the front.
So I would sit on it and my stepdad would drag me around the backyard.
That is so unfair.
Not really, I got to drag him around too.
Friends S07E09  The One With All The Candy
Hey, what are you guys doing?
Making holiday candy for the neighbors.
I'm sorry, who?
I'm gonna hang this basket on the door.
and when the neighbors walk by, they can all take a piece.
But we don't know the neighbors. I do.
There's, uh, let's see, the guy with the mustache...
...smokes-a-lot lady, some kids I've seen...
...and the red-haired guy who does not like to be called Rusty.
See, this is exactly why I'm making this candy.
We can learn their names and get to know our neighbors.
Wouldn't it be easier if we just moved?
Good morning.
Ah, somebody's in a good mood. Well, why shouldn't I be?
I have great friends. I have a wonderful job...
Where you can make out with your assistant.
Come on, it's not a big deal.
We stayed up all night coming up with a plan...
...so that us dating will not be a problem.
Oh, yeah? What's the plan?
We-We are not...
...going to let it...
...be a problem.
Wow. It took you all night to come up with that plan?
Oh, well, you know, we did other stuff too.
Did you two...?
Oh, Monica come on, you know I don't sleep with guys on the first date.
Matt Wire, Mark Lynn, Ben Wise. Anymore.
Hi, Tag, um, I have a conference call today, is that correct?
Yes, at 4. Okay, thank you, that'll be all.
Wait, wait.
Did you see that?
That mail guy had no idea there was something going on between us.
I'd better get back to my desk. Okay, you hard worker!
I'll remember to put that in your evaluation.
My what? You've been here for two months now...
...and your boss is required to hand in a performance evaluation.
But you know, there is one thing that I have yet to evaluate.
Are you serious? No, I've just always wanted to do that.
Can you help me clean this up?
The basket is totally empty. My God, the neighbors ate all the candy.
Well, either that or, uh...
Joey.
Yeah?
Did you eat all the neighbor candy? Uh, well, yeah, that was the plan.
But by the time I got to it there was only a couple of pieces left.
Yeah. They've been coming by all day. They love it.
They love my candy?
Oh, man, I gotta go make more. Hey, Mon.
you might wanna make some more lasagna too. because something might have happened to a huge chunk of it.
Ross, the neighbors ate all my candy.
Mine stole my newspaper.
It's like a crime wave.
Pheebs, you, uh, got a second?
Sure. Yeah.
Ever since you, uh, told me that story about that bike...
...I couldn't stop thinking about it.
I mean, everyone should have a first bike, you know? So...
Oh, my God, Ross.
You like it? I love it.
Yeah? Oh. Oh, God...
And I love you. Ah.
Not that way.
But the bike got you a lot closer. Oh.
Well, uh, take it downstairs.
You know, give it a test drive.
Okay. Oh, my God.
My first bike.
Thank you for the best present I've ever gotten.
You're welcome.
Oh, and Chandler's about to cry.
Am not.
Who is that?
Don't worry, I'm brave. I am brave. I-I am brave.
No, no, no, no, no.
Can you tell me who is there, please?
My name's Gary. I live upstairs.
Hi. Hi.
Do you know what time it is? It's candy time.
My roommate says that they taste like little drops of heaven.
Oh, please. Heh.
Did you hear that? "Little drops of heaven."
Four a.m.
So can I get some candy?
I am sorry, but some of us have to get up early and go to work.
He does not know that I am not "some of us."
Um, listen, I'm sorry, but I'll put some out first thing in the morning.
Well, okay, I'll swing by later.
You live in this building? Mm-hm.
Mm. Seems like I would have remembered you.
Mm. Night, Gar.
So did you read your evaluation yet?
No, it was marked "confidential."
I just sent it down to Human Resources.
Okay, please, you're kidding, right? I wrote that one as a joke for you.
A joke they would appreciate?
I'm thinking no.
What did you say? Um, I said that you were a good kisser...
...and, uh, that I liked your your tiney-tiny touchie.
No, not my touchie.
Well, it gets worse.
When asked if you take initiative, I wrote:
"Yes, he was able to unhook my bra with minimal supervision."
And under problems with performance, I wrote, "Dear God, I hope not."
And then, uh-And then I drew a little smiley face.
And then a small pornographic sketch.
Ross, that is so sweet of you to get Phoebe that bike.
When I heard the story, I almost cried.
Almost cried, huh?
Hear that, Chandler? "Almost" cried.
Hey, you cry every time somebody talks about Titanic.
Those two had only each other.
Phoebe really likes the bike, huh?
Oh, yeah. I saw her walking it down the street the other day.
She had these flowers in the basket. It was so cute.
Yeah, I saw her this morning walking it by the park.
Wait a minute, she was walking the bike? Both times?
Hey, Pheebs. Oh, hi.
Hey, so you enjoying the bike? Oh, uh-huh, so much. Heh.
Pheebs, you, uh-You do know how to ride a bike, don't you? Heh.
Of course.
Can we see you ride it?
0Kay.
See?
This is why I told you never get involved with your assistant.
And there's no such thing as keeping secrets when it comes to having affairs.
Did you hear that, Chandler?
No such thing.
What happened? I'm just eating candy.
Maybe it's not as bad as I think. Y'know, maybe they didn't take it the way I meant it.
Absolutely, you know? Because "tushy" can mean both ass...
...and good worker.
Ugh, I just gotta get the thing back.
Rach? That sketch you mentioned?
Might it have looked a little something like this?
Oh, my God, Joey.
What is the matter with you? God.
Boy I tell ya, this little talent came in handy before I could afford porn.
Hi, I'm sorry. I know it's after hours, but I really need candy.
I'm sorry, I can't help you. See? Rules are rules.
Please, I have people coming from out of town today.
I told them all about your candy. No kidding,
Out-of-towners, huh? Heh. What did you tell them?
I told them your candy was absolutely indescribable.
Well, some people have been saying it's "little drops of heaven," but whatever.
Please, can't you help me out? Hey, Chandler, do we know that lady?
Maybe. Isn't she the woman who lives below you and has sex really loud?
All right, I'll do it just this Once.
But you can't tell anybody. Yes, yes, please, just give it to me.
Yeah, that's her.
Thank you. Unbelievable.
I can't believe that sign didn't work.
You know what would work? Stop making candy.
But they like it.
You mean they like you.
Maybe.
Is that why you became a chef, so that people would like you?
Heh. You want to talk about getting people to like you, huh, funny man?
Okay, now, just remember everything I taught you and you'll be fine.
Okay? Here we go.
Ready, set--
Wait, this seat is really uncomfortable.
Maybe before we start we should just get another one.
Perhaps like an airplane seat, or a beanbag chair.
Phoebe, you can't get out of this, okay? You have to learn how to ride a bike.
Why? Why do I have to learn?
Well, in case of an emergency. What kind of emergency?
Well let there—what if a man comes along and puts a gun to your head and says:
"You ride this bike or I'll--
I'll shoot you."
Okay. I would ring the bell to distract him...
...and then I would knock the gun out of his hand with a Chinese throwing star.
Okay, Phoebe, just get on the bike...
...and, hey, I'll hold you up and push you. Okay?
You won't let go?
No. You swear?
I swear.
Okay. Come on.
Here we go. All right? All right? All right.
Feel good? All right, try pedaling.
That's it, you're doing great. Yes, take control.
Yes, yes, yes. Whee! Hey!
Oh, no.
You swore.
I just thought you were doing so well. I am shocked. Shocked.
It's a legitimate learning technique.
Hey.
There's, uh, some people outside asking about candy.
Well, they're just gonna have to wait, aren't they? I only got two hands.
Need some help? No, you don't know the system.
I don't need nobody messing with the system.
By the way, the week before your wedding, you may not see a lot of me.
Oh, hello, liar.
Look, I'm really sorry I let go of the bike.
I could've been killed, I hope you know.
I know, I know.
But can we please try it again?
I mean, you were so close, Phoebe.
Well, I would love to...
...but the bike got stolen and the police have no suspects.
Phoebe. What?
What the hell?
All right, you know what?
If you are not going to learn how to ride this bike, then I'm sorry...
...I'm just gonna have to take it back. What? Why?
Because. Because it's...
It'd be like you having this guitar...
...and never playing it.
Okay, this guitar wants to be played.
And this bike wants to be ridden.
And if you don't ride it...
...you're killing its spirit.
The bike...
...is dying"
All right. If you care enough to make up that load of crap, okay.
Great.
You're making the bike very happy.
Okay, Ross.
Please don't die.
Okay, I think we can get the evaluation back before they see it.
We have to get into Mr. Zelner's office. Now, he doesn't get in until 10, so he's no problem,
But his assistant, Betty, comes in early to eat her breakfast at her desk.
That's kind of sad. Yeah, well, Betty's kind of sad.
Which is why I believe I can lure her away with these chocolates.
Now, while I distract her, you go in the office.
Got it. Let's roll.
Hello, Rachel. You, uh, got a minute?
Yeah, sure, Mr. Zelner. For you? Anything. Minute.
Okay, great.
Abort the plan. Abort the plan.
Uh, actually, I'd like to speak to both of you.
0Kay.
Uh, well can we, can we get you anything, Mr. Zelner? Maybe some chocolates?
Um, no, thanks, but I'll give these to Betty.
So I read your evaluation of Tag.
Or, uh, to use his full name, Tag "Sweet Cheeks" Jones?
Is something going on with you two?
Oh, my God, can you imagine if there was?
I mean, what would happen exactly?
Well, I'd be forced to file a report.
I'd have to consult with the legal department.
And your future at the company would be in jeopardy.
Well-Uh, Mr. Zelner...
...I'm the one who filled in that evaluation.
Oh, no-Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I thought it would be funny.
You wrote that you have a cute tushy?
Yes.
I have a weird sense of humor.
And I'm kind of strangely proud of my butt.
It's kind of a risky joke, Tag.
And what is-what is this drawing? I can't figure out what this is.
You're looking at it upside down-You know what? It doesn't matter.
Hey, it's not like I don't have a sense of humor, huh?
Hell, I even enjoy a naughty limerick every now and then.
But there's a time and a place, huh?
Unless you, uh, have a limerick right now.
No? Okay. Well, uh, you've got my fax number.
I can't believe you did that. That was really sweet.
Ah, don't worry about it. No, you could've lost your job.
Are you kidding me? With a cute butt like this, I'd find work.
Thank you, you're great.
You know what? What?
I feel great.
In fact...
What?
It's just-It took me so long to get that desk organized.
I'm sorry.
There it is.
What is going on?
We're waiting for the candy. Bring out the candy.
Yeah, lady, give us candy.
Joey.
What's up, buddy? What are you doing?
Waiting to get candy.
Get in here.
Hey, and you cannot smoke in here.
Merry Christmas.
Okay, guys, the candy is coming. I just need 15 minutes for the chocolate to cool.
All right, everybody, just be quiet. Be quiet. Be quiet. Pipe down.
What is the matter with you people?
This woman was trying to do a nice thing for you.
She was making candy so she could try to get to know all of you...
...and I'll bet that not one of you can tell me her name.
Am I right?
Candy Lady?
No, not "Candy Lady."
Hey, if we know it, can we have candy?
All right, you know what?
Forget it. All of you, forget it. You've ruined it.
Go home. You've ruined it. You've ruined it.
That's all wrong. You guys ruined everything. You ruined it.
Thank you. You're welcome.
Did you smoke?
No, smokes-a-lot lady blew smoke directly into my mouth.
Uh, are you okay?
I'm fine now, but it was really scary there for a while.
I mean, someone slipped a threatening note under the door.
Oh, yeah. Sorry about that. Mob mentality or whatever. I don't know.
I can't believe it. I did it. I rode a bike.
I never thought I'd be able to do that. Thank you, Ross.
Oh, hey, don't thank me. Thank yourself.
You're the one who faced your fears and ultimately overcame them.
Don't be so corny, Ross. It's not an After School Special.
Bye-bye.
I just got reservations at Michelle's...
...and tickets to The MusicMan to celebrate...
...our first holiday as a betrothed couple.
"Betrothed." Betrothed couple.
Hey. Hi.
Pheebs? Uh-huh?
Skull?
Oh. Yeah, it's my mom's.
Oh, my God!
No, no, no. It's not my mom.
It belonged to my mom.
She used to put it out every Christmas...
...to remind us that even though it's Christmas, people still die.
And you can put candy in it.
Hey. Hey.
Licorice?
Sure.
Hey, I just found out, I get Ben for the holidays this year. That's great!
Are you gonna dress up as Santa? Nope.
I mean, I know Susan does every year.
but I think I want to take this year to teach him about Hanukkah.
And maybe I could teach Ben...
...about the Christmas skull and how people die.
You may need to use this year to teach Ben about Phoebe.
Hey.
Did you know he was in there? No.
How long have we been home? About half an hour.
Lovely.
Friends  S07E10  The One With the Holiday Armadillo
You know what I was thinking? When we get married, will you, uh...
...change your name to "Bing"?
No.
Why not?
Bing's weird.
Oh, hey, you guys.
Hey. Hey.
Guess what?
My landlord just called. My apartment's gonna be ready soon.
I guess I'll be moving out.
Aw, Phoebe, I'm gonna miss you.
Yes, you will be very sad.
I gotta go tell Rachel the good news. Oh. You'll be living together again?
Why not? Well, she's just so much fun with Joey...
...I assumed she'd still be living with him.
Why do you think she's having so much fun living with Joey?
No reason, except she...
...told me.
She said she didn't want to live with me?
No. No, she didn't say that.
I think you should talk to Monica now.
Phoebe, don't worry about it. I'm sure she wants to live with you.
You're absolutely sure?
No, but I'll bet she probably does.
Oh, probably?
I don't like that word.
I know what "probably" really means. Yeah, uh-huh, yeah.
"Oh, your mom probably won't kill herself."
You know. I'm sorry, but I'm not hanging my hopes...
...of Rachel and I living together on "probably."
Y'know? You gotta take care of yourself in this world.
History teaches us nothing.
Bing doesn't seem so weird now, does it?
Hey! Great, You're home.
Guess what Phoebe got me for Christmas?
Drums? No, drums!
Hi, Could we get two burritos to go, please? Ha, ha.
I'm sorry. But not that sorry, you don't have to live with it.
Um, we have a reservation under the name Chandler Bing.
Okay, we'll have a table for you in about 45 minutes.
Forty-five minutes? We have tickets to The MusicMan at 8.
I'm sorry. Christmas is a very busy time, sir.
Is this because of the burrito thing?
You need to give him money. Give him money? It was a joke!
No, to get a table! Places like this are always shaking you down.
Everybody wants to be paid off. All right, calm down, O'Malley.
I'll slip him some money. You've got to be smooth about it.
Hey, I can be smooth.
Listen, we're a little bit in a hurry, so, if you could get us a table...
...a little quicker, I'd appreciate it.
Of course, sir. Okay.
How'd it go? Had the money in the wrong hand.
Hey, ahh, You don't feel...
...like you're gonna throw up? No.
Well, I do. So let's...
So, Ben, you, uh...
You know what holiday is coming up? don't ya?
Christmas.
Yeah, and you know what other holiday is coming up?
Christmas Eve.
Yes, but also...
Hanukkah!
See, you're part Jewish and Hanukkah is a Jewish holiday.
Santa has reindeers that can fly.
Right, urn, but on Hanukkah--
Hanukkah is a celebration of a miracle.
Years and years ago there were these people called the Maccabees.
Okay, that's right. Yes...
...but on Hanukkah, we sing, uh:
Ha, ha. Okay, it's not a contest.
When is Santa coming?
Well, how about this year, instead of Santa...
...we have fun celebrating Hanukkah?
No Santa?
Was I bad?
No, no, no, you weren't bad. You've been very good, Ben.
Santa's mad at me. No, hey, hey, come on.
Ben, Santa is not mad at you, okay?
You're his favorite little guy.
So Santa's coming?
Yes!
Santa's coming.
It's easy. Just keep it casual.
Give him a kind word, Shake his hand and give him the money.
How do you know so much about this? I don't know.
Richard used to do it, didn't he?
We'd be eating our soup right now.
Mustached bastard.
Okay, those people just left. Come on. Quick, give him the money and get their table!
Excuse me.
We're in a bit of a hurry. Can we please...?
So you like the drums.
That's great.
Y'know, I was worried that they would create maybe...
...an unbearable living situation.
But, okay, well, apparently not. So, yay!
Hey, Pheebs, check it out, we already learned a song.
Ready? One, two, three, four.
Tequila!
That's fun.
Here you go.
Thank you, Gunther. Put her there.
Definitely not easier with coins.
Thank you. Thank you.
Hey, Pheebs. Hey.
Here. Now I only owe you $49.50.
Hey, Pheebs. Hey.
If you want to get Joey a Christmas present that disrupts the entire building...
...why not something a little bit more subtle...
...like a wrecking ball...
...or a vial of smallpox to release in the hallway?
It's not just the drum noise. Every five minutes...
...Joey throws his sticks in the air...
...and I have to hear: "Oh, my eye! Oh, God, my eye!"
I mean, it's so annoying. Yes, thank you.
You see, this is how normal people are supposed to react to drums.
Phoebe, You got Joey drums to annoy Rachel...
...so she wouldn't want to live there anymore?
Maybe on some level.
Joey, y'know that you could just not throw the sticks up in the air.
What is rock 'n' roll about that?
Hey, Joey, I got you another present.
Okay wait, Before you tell me what it is...
Okay, what is it?
It's a...
...tarantula!
God, Rachel, look, I'm sorry. What was I thinking...
...giving Joey this big, gross, scary spider...
...in such a poorly constructed cage?
What are you talking about? I love them.
I had a tarantula when I was a kid. But it-it died, because my cat ate it.
And then my cat died.
But, Joey, isn't this cool?
Is it on me? I feel like it's on me. I got--
Oh, isn't that adorable?
Joey is afraid of the tarantula. Oh.
Ah, yeah, He's so adorable.
He's so much fun.
Joey is the best, I'm glad you're having so much fun here.
What? Wait-wait a minute,
Phoebe, What's the matter?
Our apartment is ready.
And that makes you angry because...?
Because you'd rather live here with Joey.
Where did you get that? Monica and Chandler...
...said you were having so much fun here...
...and apparently no amount of drums or tarantulas is gonna change that.
Phoebe? Did you get all this stuff for Joey...
...to try to drive me out of the apartment?
Honey, if you wanted to do that, you might as well just gotten him a fish,
You know how fish freak me out.
Fish.
It wouldn't have mattered anyway, Phoebe, you and I are, are gonna live together.
We're roommates, that's the deal.
Yes, but I wanted you to want to live with me.
But okay, if you're having so much fun over here--
Oh. It's so much more fun with you.
We did have fun, didn't we? We did.
Oh, anyway, they say if we want, we could see it tonight.
Oh, I would love to. Yay, okay!
Good, good, good. Great. All right. Good.
And Monica asked me to make the drumming stop.
Done.
Hey.
Hello, sir. You here to return those pants?
No, these are my pants.
Oh.
0Kay.
How can I help you? Um, do you have a Santa outfit left?
Two days before Christmas? Sorry, man.
Okay, look. Do you have anything, uh, Christmas-y?
I promised my son, and I really don't want to disappoint him.
Um, come on, I…uh, you gotta have something.
I'm the Holiday Armadillo!
I'm a friend of Santa's...
...and he sent me here to wish you...
...a merry Christmas!
What happened to Santa, Holiday Armadillo?
Santa was unavailable...
...so close to Christmas.
Come in, have a seat.
You must be exhausted, coming all the way from Texas.
Texas? That's right, Ben.
I'm Santa's representative...
...for all the Southern states.
And Mexico!
But Santa sent me here...
...to give you these presents, Ben.
Maybe the lady will help me with these presents.
Wow, thanks!
You're welcome, Ben.
Merry Christmas. Ooh.
And happy Hanukkah!
Are you for Hanukkah too? Because I'm part Jewish.
You are? Me too.
Because armadillos also wandered in the desert?
You want to wander in the hall?
Oh. Hey, Ben!
What if the Holiday Armadillo...
...told you all about the Festival of Lights?
Cool!
Come on, Ben.
Years and years ago...
...there were these people called...
...the Maccabees!
Ho-ho-ho. Merry Christmas!
Santa!
Hey.
What are you doing here, Santa?
Well, I'm here to see my old buddy, Ben.
What are you doing here...
...Weird Turtle Man?
I'm the Holiday Armadillo...
...your part-Jewish friend.
You sent me here to give Ben some presents.
Remember?
What?
Did you bring me any presents, Santa'?
You bet I did, Ben.
Put her there.
Well, it would have worked this time if his hands weren't so damn small.
Ho-ho-ho.
Ben, why don't you come open more presents.
Santa, the armadillo and I have a little talk in the kitchen.
There's a sentence I never thought I'd say.
What are you doing?
You called everyone and said you were having trouble finding a Santa costume...
...so I borrowed one from a guy at work.
Thank you, but you gotta leave.
Why? Because...
...I'm finally getting him excited about Hanukkah...
...and you're wrecking it.
But I didn't get to shake my belly like a bowlful of jelly.
I'm sorry, Chandler but this, but this is really important to me.
Fine, I'll give the suit back.
Hey, you think you can keep it another night?
Santa, really?
Yeah, is that okay?
Did your dad ever dress up like Santa?
No. Then it's okay!
Okay, Ben. Santa has to go.
Say goodbye.
No, why does he have to go?
Because if Santa and the Holiday...
...Armadillo...
...are ever in the same room for too long...
...the universe will implode!
Merry Christmas!
No, why can't the armadillo leave? I want Santa.
Fine, I give up. Santa--
Santa can stay!
Well, I'll stay...
...but only because I want to hear about Hanukkah.
Ben, will you sit here with Santa...
...and learn about Hanukkah?
Okay, Santa.
Thank you. You're welcome.
All right, it's time...
...for the story of Hanukkah.
Years and years ago...
...there were these people called the Maccabees!
Merry Christmas!
Oh, wow, look at this place!
Oh, this is terrible.
They've made so many changes...
...I can't even feel my grandmother's presence anymore.
Oh, new sconces!
Oh, my God! What?
Okay, remember uh, remember how you told me your grandmother put up that wall...
...to make that into two bedrooms? Yeah.
And remember how you always said you were afraid the landlord might find out...
...and then tear it down? Yeah?
Do you really not know where I'm going with this?
It left. It's one huge room.
Oh, no!
Wow!
See?
Well, I guess we'll have to put the wall back up.
You can't because of the new skylight. There's a skylight?
Wow!
Oh. So what should we do? Should we start looking for a new place?
You know, I'm sensing...
...that, urn, my grandmother would not be comfortable with that.
Oh, yeah?
Starting to feel her again there, are we?
A little bit. Yeah. Yeah.
Pheebs is your grandmother maybe saying that you should live here alone?
You heard it too? You have the gift.
Phoebe, it's okay.
I like living with Joey.
Are you sure? Please. I hate packing...
...it's closer to work.
And we do have fun.
Although, I'm really gonna miss living with you.
Oh, me too. I know.
Oh. wait did you hear that-hear that?
Listen, I'm getting something from your grandmother.
She said since you get to keep the one-bedroom apartment...
...you should give Rachel the purple chair.
No, I do not hear that.
And the miracle was that that little bit of oil...
...that should have lasted just one day, burned for...
Eight whole days. That's right.
And that's why we celebrate Hanukkah today. The end.
Awesome. Yeah.
My favorite part...
...was when Superman flew all the Jews out of Egypt.
The armadillo was actually not so thrilled about that part.
Okay, Ben, it's time to light...
...the Hanukkah candles!
Hey.
Oh. Wow.
Looks like the Easter Bunny's funeral in here.
Come on, come on. We're lighting the candles.
Oh, oh.
I understand why Superman is here...
...but why is there a porcupine at the Easter Bunny's funeral?
You get it? I got it.
Back in the cage?
It's back in the cage.
ls the cage closed?
Joey, will you just come out here and stop being such a baby?
Oh. Mm.
Hi. Hey.
You have got to try this cheesecake.
Oh, you know, I'm not that much of a sweet tooth--
Oh, my God, it's so creamy. Oh.
Oh, my God. That's the best cheesecake I've ever had.
Where did you get this?
It was at the front door when I got home. Somebody sent it to us.
Chandler, this isn't addressed to you.
This is addressed to Mrs. Braverman downstairs.
Thief.
I didn't read the box before I opened it...
...and you can't return a box after you opened it.
Why not? Because it's too delicious.
Chandler, you stole this cheesecake. That is wrong.
No, no, no, it is going to be okay...
...because Mrs. Braverman is gonna send away for a free one.
And that way, we all win.
The only losers are the big cheesecake conglomerate:
"Mama's Little Bakery."
I feel terrible.
I'm a horrible, horrible, horrible person.
Well, I'm sorry, what?
Friends  S07E11 The One With All The Cheesecakes
All right, I should get going. Big day a work.
You know how I'm in a coma?
Today they do a test on me and it turns out I'm not brain-dead.
So--
Ah-ah, Mr. Smarty-Pants.
It's just my character that's not brain-dead.
Hey, so Pheebs, still on for tonight?
Absolutely. Okay. All right, I'll see you at 8. Okay.
Oh, what's at 8?
Oh, I have dinner plans with Joey.
We get together about once a month to discuss the rest of you guys.
Wow. Did not know that.
May I say how lovely you look today?
Duly noted.
Oh, so for tomorrow...
...do you want to rent a car and drive down together or what?
What are you talking about?
Cousin Frannie's wedding. It's tomorrow night.
You were invited?
No.
Oh, my God, I can't believe this.
I mean I knew Mom and Dad were invited. I thought that was it.
I mean, from the ages of 7 to 9, Frannie and I were inseparable.
Well, maybe since the age of 9, Frannie's made some new friends.
Well l-look okay, it's probably just a mistake. Let me call Aunt Cheryl, okay?
Maybe you are invited and the invitation just got lost in the mail.
Yeah, well, you call her and tell her that, you know, when we were kids...
...her precious little Frannie tried to undress me several times, okay?
If I hadn't stopped her, there probably wouldn't be a wedding to go to.
She tried to undress me too.
I used to undress my cousin Glenn.
Joseph Francis Tribbiani, are you home yet?
Um, I think he's still out. What's wrong?
Well, I'll tell you, Rachel Karen Green.
I had plans with Joey tonight, and he left me this note.
"Pheebs, can't make it. Got a date. Talk to you later.
Big Daddy?
"Big Daddy"? Oh, that's a nickname we were trying out.
Hey, you know what nickname never caught on? "The Ross-a-tron."
Hey. Oh, here's Joseph Francis.
Whoa, what are you middle-naming me for'?
I left you a note.
So what? That doesn't give you the right to ditch me.
Hey, you can cancel plans with friends if there's a possibility for sex.
Phoebe, he's right. That is the rule.
I don't accept this rule.
When we make plans, I expect you to show up.
Okay, I can't just be a way to kill time till you meet someone better.
You know, boyfriends and girlfriends are gonna come and go, but this is for life.
Wow. I'm so sorry. I had no idea it would bother you this much.
Well, it does.
Okay, can I make it up to you? Huh?
I'm sorry.
How about dinner tomorrow night? I'll pay for myself.
Okay, you wore me down.
Hey Joe, while you're over there, how about another beer for "The Ross-a-tron"?
"Ross--" Is that back?
Hi. The other cheesecake came.
They delivered it to the wrong address again.
So just bring it back downstairs. What's the problem?
I can't seem to say goodbye.
Are you serious? Chandler, we ate an entire cheesecake two days ago...
...and you want more?
Well, I've forgotten what it tastes like, okay?
It was cheesecake. It was fine.
It had a buttery, crumbly, graham-cracker crust...
...with a very rich...
...yet light cream-cheese filling.
Wow, my whole mouth just filled with saliva. Ahem.
Y'know what? Forget it. We are just hungry.
We have not had lunch. We are just light-headed.
So let us go out and have lunch and forget about the cheesecake.
Yeah and we'll drop it off downstairs so that we're not tempted.
Good idea. Where do you wanna go to lunch?
Mama's Little Bakery, Chicago, Illinois.
Mel Torme died.
Joey, that paper's like a year old.
Oh, does that mean the Sam Goody's sale is over?
Hey. Hey.
So I finally heard back from Aunt Cheryl...
...and apparently it wasn't a mistake.
Uh, there's limited seating in the hall--
Limited seating? I am just one tiny person.
Well yeah, but she doesn't know that.
I mean, the last time she saw you...
...you would've turned one of those little wedding chairs into kindling.
"Limited seating." That's such a lame excuse.
That's not the reason why she's not inviting me.
What's the big deal? I wasn't even invited to the ceremony, just the reception.
And you know what? If it makes you feel any better...
...Joan and I will just make an appearance...
...and then we'll leave early as a sign of protest.
Joan? Yeah, Joan Tedeschi, my date.
She's an assistant professor in the Linguistics Department.
Tall, very beautiful.
And despite what some people say, not broad-backed.
Wait a minute. You got "Ross Geller and guest"?
I wasn't invited, and you got "and guest"?
Uh, excuse me, I do have to interrupt on Ross' behalf.
I think the rule applies here y'know,
Since he has a chance to get on broad-back--
Not broad-back!
Wait a minute. You're bringing me.
What? I can't cancel on Joan.
Why not? Did you not hear me?
She's an assistant professor in the Linguistics Department, okay?
They're wild.
Why do you want to come anyway? Because...
...she's my cousin.
I mean, we grew up together.
Family, you know? And all that's important to me.
Okay, all right. I'll take you.
I'll go call Joan.
Oh, that's nice.
Family should be there.
This is her wedding. Happiest day of her life.
We'll see. Ha, ha.
Well, thank you for lunch.
What? Wait a minute, I didn't pay. I thought you paid.
So apparently, we just don't pay for food anymore.
Do you see what I see? Huh! It's still there.
Mrs. Braverman must be out.
She could be out of town. Maybe she'll be gone for months.
By then, the cheesecake may have gone bad.
We don't want her to come back to bad cheesecake.
No that could kill her. Well, we don't want that.
No so we're protecting her.
We should take it. But we should move quick.
Why? Because I think I just heard her moving around in there.
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!
Oh, my God, that's David.
Who? David, the scientist guy.
David that I was in love with.
David who went to Russia and broke my heart, David.
Oh, my God.
Oh, you say someone's name enough, they turn around.
Phoebe. David.
What are you doing here? Aren't you supposed to be in Russia?
Yeah, I'm just in town for a conference.
Um, God, you look phenomenal.
Well, ha, ha...
Yeah.
You look great too. Did you get a haircut?
Yeah. Well, I got like 3O of them.
Yeah.
Um, look, I got a confession to make. Uh-huh.
Um, I was hoping to run into you here.
I didn't know that I should call or not. You know, I was only in town a few days...
...and, you know, I didn't want to intrude on your life or anything like that,
But I really wanted to see you...
...but I didn't know if you wanted to see me.
Of course I would want to see you. I think about you all the time.
Really? Because I think about you all the time.
Really? There's a statue in Minsk...
...that reminds me of you so much.
I mean, um, it's actually of Lenin...
...but, you know, at certain angles... Yeah.
Anyway, do you want to have dinner tonight?
Yes.
Oh, no. Oh.
Uh, what? I can't.
I can't believe I have plans. I can't. Can you do it tomorrow?
Uh, no, I have to go in a few hours. I have to be on the redeye.
Well, listen, you know, next time you're in Minsk, uh...
Phoebe? Can I talk to you for a second? Uh-huh.
What are you doing?
Well, I have plans with Joey tonight. So? He'll understand.
No, he won't. And that's not even the point.
Monica, I made a whole speech about how you do not cancel plans with friends.
And now, you know, what? Just because, potentially, the love of my life...
...comes back from Russia just for one night, I should change my beliefs?
I should change my beliefs.
No. No, no. If I don't have my principles, I don't have anything.
God, you are so strong.
Or I should rush through dinner with Joey and I could meet David at 9.
Oh, my God, that is so good.
I'm full. And yet I know if I stop eating this...
...I'll regret it.
Hey, what have you got there?
Oh, it's, um...
it's tofu cake. Do you want some? Aah.
What are you doing tonight? Huh?
Uh. Dude. Dude.
Sorry. Uh, I got those plans with Phoebe.
Oh, really? Uh, Monica said she had a date at 9.
What? Tonight? That's what Monica said.
After she gave me that big speech...
...she goes and makes a date on the same night she has plans with me'?
I think she's trying to pull a fast one on Big Daddy.
Oh here, I think this is us. Yeah.
Limited seating, my ass.
Let's just see who made the cut.
Hi. Hi. I'm Monica Geller.
How do you know the bride and groom? I worked with Frannie.
Used to work with her. Used to.
I'm a relative and I didn't get invited, okay?
A blood relative. Blood.
Stop saying "blood" to strangers.
So how about you? How do you know the happy couple?
We went to college with both of them. And now we live next door.
Okay, you're fine.
Hey. Are you guys ready? Hey. Yes.
I will have a green salad, urn, house dressing and water's fine.
Okay. And for you, sir?
Yeah. This slow-roasted salmon...
...just how slow are we talkin' here?
It's already been roasted.
Oh, then no. Maybe I should hear those specials again.
Oh, Joey, we've heard the specials three times, okay?
There's prime rib, mahi-mahi and a very special lobster ravioli.
Actually, we're out of the lobster ravioli. Oh, well, that changes everything.
You know what, Pheebs? Uh-huh.
You were right before. Friends are so important.
Yeah, I'm very wise. I know.
You know what I really want?
What? ls to have a long, long talk.
You know? Get Joey out on the open road and really open him up.
Any progress? Yes.
I will have the lobster ravioli.
God, Joey, this is taking forever.
What's the rush? Well...
...I just have, you know, an appointment.
And it's very important.
What is it?
Well...
...it's a date.
A date? No, no, Pheebs, you must be mistaken...
...because you wouldn't schedule a date...
...on the night you have plans with a friend.
Come on. Don't make me feel badly about this.
No, I'm gonna.
That's right. Yeah, you made me feel really guilty...
...about going outwith that girl.
Like I did something terrible to you. Now, Pheebs, you're doing the same thing.
That's not the same thing. This is totally different.
This is with David. Remember David, the scientist guy?
Okay, he's very special to me.
Okay, well, my girl from the other night was special.
She was a scientist too.
She was? Well, she graduated high school.
Okay, whatever. Know what?
I don't have time to convince you.
He's only here for four hours and I'm gonna go see him.
Fine. Fine! Yeah. Yeah.
What are you still doing here? I told you, lobster ravioli.
Hey. Hey.
Oh, I was just about to leave. I didn't think you were coming.
Oh, I wouldn't have missed this. Ha, ha.
Well, I'm very glad you're here.
Oh, you're such a gentleman.
Come on, we're going to my place.
Are you eating the cheesecake without me?
I will give you $100 to whistle right now.
How can you eat the cheesecake without me?
What are you gonna do?
Gonna run and tell Monica or Joey? No, you'd have to tell them what we did.
We are dessert stealers. We are living outside the law.
You know what? I don't trust you with this cake anymore!
And I got it first, and I'm taking it back. What?
What? Oh, no, you don't. Oh, yes.
You think I trust you with it?
We're gonna split it. You take half, I take half.
That's not fair. You had some.
Oh, you know what? I think Monica would be very interested to know...
...that you called her cheesecake dry and mealy.
What do we use to split it? Okay.
All right, pick a half. Okay.
Well, this side looks bigger. Mm-hm.
Uh, but there's more crust on this side.
Yeah. So maybe if I measure it--
For God's sake, pick a piece.
All right, I pick that one. So the smaller piece.
Okay. There you go.
Enjoy your half, my friend. But that is it.
No sharing, no switching, and don't come crying to me...
...if you eat your piece too fast.
Oh!
You gonna give me some of your piece? Oh, no.
No switching, no sharing. And don't come crying to me.
Ha, ha. I may just sit here and have my cake all day.
Just sit here in the hallway and eat my--
Ross, sweetheart.
Oh, hey, Aunt Millie.
Isn't it a beautiful wedding? Yes. Yes, it is.
Every time, on the lips.
Why? Why on the lips?
There's Frannie. Won't she be happy to see me?
Now, wait a minute. You be nice, all right?
I didn't bring you here so you could ambush her.
Frannie was the one who found your Playboys and showed them to Mom.
That bitch.
Monica. What--?
Am I doing here? Surprised to see me?
Ross brought me. How do you like that?
Hi, Frannie. Congratulations.
You invite my brother, you invite my whole family, and not me? Why?
Why wouldn't you want me at your wedding?
What could I have possibly done?
Stuart.
I believe you know my husband.
So it's really a question of "who" could you have possibly done.
I hate this, but I have to go. Mm-hm.
I can't miss my flight.
Are you sure? I bet there's another flight to Minsk in--
July
That's really beautiful. What does it mean?
"Please clean my beakers."
I don't get out of the lab much.
I thought it meant something else.
Yeah, well, I really actually wanted to say, um...
...that.
But, urn, I figured I probably shouldn't because...
...you know, I have to leave.
Hmm. No, you're right. Don't say it.
I do, though.
I do too.
Well, bye, Phoebe.
Okay, now's not the time, Joey, all right? You can yell at me tomorrow.
No, no. No, Pheebs. I'm not gonna yell at you.
I just started thinking about you and David...
...and I remember how bummed you were the first time he left.
Oh, Pheebs, come here.
Are you okay? No, I'm not okay.
The only guy I've ever been crazy about is going to Minsk...
...and I may never see him again.
Hey, you could always visit him.
Oh, right. Like they're gonna let me have a passport.
Anything I can do? Whatever you need.
Well, now...
...if you achieve positronic distillation of subatomic particles before he does...
...then he could come back.
I could give it a shot.
Oh, look. There's a piece that doesn't have floor on it.
Stick to your side. Come on, now.
All right, what are we having?
Oh, wait, I forgot my wrap.
Oh, okay, wait here.
Hi, sweetie. Are you leaving?
Well-Give us a kiss. Come on.
Why? Why on the lips?
Ross, when's this comet thing start?
Well, technically, it started 7 billion years ago.
No, no. Oh, God.
Okay! Okay! Fine, I'll stop. No teaching, okay?
We'll just watch the pretty light streaking across the sky.
Okay? Okay.
Whose official name is Bapstein-King. Okay! Okay!
There it is. Oh, look at that!
Isn't Mother Nature amazing?
That's a plane.
Well, all right, 1700 bags of peanuts flying that high...
...that's pretty amazing too.
Hey, I wonder if you can see my apartment. No. No, you can't.
What? Oh I don't-I don't know.
Man, look at all those stars.
Infinite space. It really, really makes you wonder, doesn't it?
Y'know what else makes you wonder? Huh?
Check out the rack on that chick.
Friends  S07E12  The One Where They're Up All Night
Okay, We've been out here for two hours...
...and we haven't seen any stupid comets. Can we go now?
I mean, Chandler's getting chilly.
No, I'm not.
Then why are you wearing Monica's jacket?
Because it's flattering!
Come on, Monica. Come on, Monica.
Yeah actually, We're taking off too. We rented a movie. Oh, I won't say no to a movie.
Oh, Pheebs, we just actually wanted to be alone.
Shh. Get me out of here. Oh, okay.
Hey, Ross. What?
Check this out. Is it the comet?
No! No-no. Look, there's a bug stuck in tar right here.
Joey come. I can't believe--
I bring you to see the Bapstein-King comet...
...one of nature's most spectacular phenomena...
...and all you care about are bugs stuck in tar and some woman.
You know, there's two women, dude.
Show me where.
Right-Right up here.
Joey, where's the pipe that was holding the door open?
I don't know.
Yeah, I do.
Joey! What? All right—Hey! don't look at me!
You wanted to come up here and look for some stupid Burger King comet.
It's called the Bapstein-King comet, okay?
Hey! Hey, Bapstein was a very well-respected astronomer from--
No! No!
No!
Monica. She's sleeping.
I know. just quick-quick question, quick question.
Which one was Deep Impact and which one was Armageddon?
Deep Impact was the one with Robert Duvall.
Armageddon is what's going to happen to you if you wake me up.
Sorry, I just can't sleep.
Where's that book you're reading with two women who are ice-skating...
...and wearing those hats with the flowers on it.
Because every time I look at that cover, I'm like:
It's in the living room, where there's also a light...
...and no one will kick you in the shin.
What?
Ow!
Please don't be a spaceship. Please don't be a spaceship.
Oh, thank God.
How could you be beeping? I just disconnected you!
I took out your battery! How can--?
Don't interrupt me!
Rachel!  Monica!
Come on!
I can't believe this!
All right, well, I guess we know what we have to do to get down.
Yeah, I guess we don't have a choice.
Help us! Please, help us!
We're stuck up on the roof, and we can't get down!
Ross.
I was thinking we'd just go down the fire escape.
I know. I wasn't finished.
But don't worry!
We're gonna go down the fire escape!
Shh-shh-shh!
I'm sorry, I thought maybe I'd make some warm milk and it would help me sleep.
With a wok?
I thought you were going to read my boring book to put you asleep.
It got interesting.
Damn you, Oprah!
Here, let me make the milk. I'm up anyway.
Hey, y'know what we can do? Y'know, now that we are up?
We can just like talk to each other all night long.
y'know like we did when we were first going out. It'd be fun.
Okay, that does sound like fun. Yeah.
Okay, so how bummed were you when the second sister died, huh?
The second sister dies?!
No.
No, I was talking about the book I was reading.
The second sister dies in Archie and Jughead Double Digest?
That's correct.
Want to go in the bedroom? It's more comfortable.
Sure. Okay.
Oh, wait, did you send those contracts to Milan?
If this is your idea of sexy talk... No.
Seriously. y'know the contracts I gave you, Did you overnight them?
What contracts?
Please tell me this is just one of your jokes that you do that I don't get. Heh, heh.
Like what?
Y'know, like the thing when you put the phone in your pants?
Tag, I'm serious. This isn't funny.
Those contracts absolutely had to go out today.
Rach, I'm sorry, You didn't give me any contracts.
Yes, I did. I put a little Post-it on it that said:
"Must go out today," and I underlined "today" three times.
and then I put a little heart in the corner because I didn't wanna seem to bossy.
I'm telling you, You never gave them to me.
Y'know what Tag, if we went down to the office, you would see those contracts sitting on your desk.
No, I'd see you looking embarrassed because they are not on my desk.
Or maybe you would see me looking embarrassed because you talk on the phone with your crotch.
You want to go to the office now? No.
Come on, it's late. We're not going down to the office.
Yeah, I understand. I wouldn't want to be proved wrong either.
All right, get your coat!
Oh! When did you unhook this? Nice work!
It won't go down any further. It's stuck.
Ugh. Well, we're just have to jump.
Yep. Now, we're gonna have to make sure to land...
...to the right of that patch of ice, okay?
Not hit the dumpster on the other side.
and uh, and try to avoid that weird brownish-red stuff in the middle.
So when you get down there...
...you go up to the roof and you let me in.
Oh whoa-whoa. Wait a minute. I have to do it? Yeah! Oh yeah, You'll be fine.
It'll be just like bungee jumping, you know?
But instead of bouncing back up, you won't.
Well, what if I smack my head on the concrete?
Well, I'm not gonna lie to you, Joey. It's a possibility.
I don't know Ross! Tell you what, let's flip to see who does it. okay?
You call it in the air, all right? Oh, all right. Tail. Oh!
Can you see what it is? No.
Okay. Well, you be careful. No. No, Ross, stop.
I'm not jumping...
Okay, Look, I have an audition tomorrow, and I can't go if I break my leg.
Well, I'm not jumping. I have a son. Okay? He won't have a father if I die.
Well all right so, it looks like we're even!
Okay, so this wire...
...is connected to this wire, which plugs into here.
Okay, so to get the beeping to stop, all I have to do...
0Kay.
Well done, Pheebs.
What do you want from me?!
Okay, Here's your milk. What should we talk about?
What? What? What?
Oh, were you sleeping, sweetie? I'm sorry. Here.
Okay. Feel free to look...
...but I'm telling you those contracts are not on this desk.
Oh how can you possibly know? Look at this mess, Tag.
I mean, This is what I'm talking about. You have to be more organized.
You've got newspapers, you've got magazines, you-Oh!
And who's this chippy?
A little young for you, but whatever.
It’s my sister.
Really? Very cute braces.
Anyway, you know what? The point is, Tag, start looking...
...because you're gonna find those contracts on your desk.
So when do you imagine you gave them to me? Morning or afternoon?
In the afternoon. Mr. Zelner came into my office after lunch...
...he put them on my desk, and then I put a Post-it on it...
...that said:
"Must go out today."
So you just keep looking in there, all right?
Not here.
Puzzler.
Bit of a puzzle.
Why don't you check the copy room? Maybe the contracts are in there.
How could I have left them in the copy room? I don't know Tag!
How can your genitals make phone calls?
Okay? It's not a perfect world. Just go, please?
Fine. Thank you.
Hello?
I still don't get it.
You still awake?
Yeah. You?
You do know that was me that just said that, right?
Hey.
As long as we're both up...
Yeah?
I hope you're not thinking about cleaning the living room.
Man, I'm starving. What the hell was I thinking at dinner?
"Do you want soup or salad?" Both, always order both.
You know, I'm looking, and I don't think anyone's home here.
I say we just break the window...
...crawl through...
...and you know, explain later.
Yeah? Really? No one's home? I don't think so.
Hello?
So when you get in there...
Okay. This is where you and I part ways.
Noisy bitch!
Oh, what? What are you doing?
Do you know what just happened?
Yeah. We had sex and then we fell asleep.
No. We were in the middle of sex...
...and you fell asleep.
No. No, that's not true.
No, best time ever.
Yeah. You rock my world.
Monica? What?
I was giving you some of my best moves, and you missed it.
So please wake up so we can do it right.
Okay. Okay. I'm ready.
Come on, big fella. Okay.
Give me the good stuff. Yeah.
No, no, no. Don't fall asleep.
Okay, I'm going to make you some coffee.
Well, I probably won't spill coffee grounds all over the kitchen floor.
Okay, I'm up. I'm up.
Hi. I got you some coffee to--
So you got anything for me?
Still no luck. Oh, my God.
Did you check your entire desk and all the drawers?
Want me to check again? Well yeah, I wish you would.
Well, no, it's not in there.
How about that drawer?
Well, it's not out here. Any chance it could be in your office?
I don't know.
I mean, let me check.
Any luck?
Can I see you in my office for a minute?
Yeah.
You found them!
I'm not even gonna gloat.
I'm just really relieved it's-You put these on my desk.
I did not. Oh, really?
So you're saying they just slid out of your bottom drawer...
...crawled across the floor, then jumped onto my desk?
How did you know they were in my bottom drawer?
I am so hot for you right now.
Oh, my God! How did you get back here?
Phoebe Buffay?
Fire Alarm?
Oh, hi, Officer Fireman. Can I help you?
We found your fire alarm in the trash chute.
That's not mine. Yes, it is.
How do you know?
The next time you want to dump a fire alarm in a trash chute, don't wrap it in a blanket that says:
"Property of Phoebe Buffay, not Monica."
Okay do you—Okay, do you have a search warrant?
Because the last time I checked, this was still America.
Please reattach it. It's against the law to disconnect them.
Fine. But please, God, tell me how to stop it from going off?
There's a reset button under the plastic cover.
There's a reset button? Oh, thank you. Thank you.
Oh. There's a reset button?
My God!
Why didn't I see that?
Reset button. Reset button.
Where is there a reset button? Oh, here it is! Oh!
Ohh, God!
Okay, you have a good grip? Yeah.
Okay, I'm gonna start to climb down you now.
All right, just hurry up. Okay.
Now-now-now, should I climb down your front so we're face to face...
...or should I climb down your back so we're...
...butt to face?
Face to face. I like face to face.
Okay, here I come. All right.
Oh, my-How much do you weigh, Ross?
I prefer not to answer that right now. I'm still carrying a little holiday weight.
Y'know, When we talked about face to face...
...I don't think we thought it all the way through.
So what do you want me to do? Just shimmy down me and drop.
Hi. Hi.
You know, maybe I should hang, and you should climb down me.
Yeah? Maybe we should talk about that for a little while!
It still looks pretty far. It's not that far. Just drop.
Do not rush me!
Ross, you should know that my pants are starting to come down, and I'm not wearing any underwear.
Whoa!
Ow! My ankle! I really hurt my ankle!
I think I twisted it when-Ooh, a quarter!
That really was some of your best work.
I told you.
I can't believe it.
I've only got two hours until I call in sick for work.
I have to be up in seven minutes.
Well, you're not gonna believe this, but if you have seven minutes...
Really?
You want to?
Okay. You get the vacuum cleaner. I'll get the furniture polish.
Hey. What are you doing? Hi.
Well, you know, I was thinking of moving the couch over here.
Why would you want to do that?
So that there would be a decent place for me to sit?
Rach, there is a decent place to... And your lap does not count.
Okay? Come on, help me move this. No, no, no.
No? No.
Rosita does not move.
I'm sorry. Rosita? As in--?
As in "Rosita does not move."
Joey, it's just a chair. What's the big deal?
The big deal is that it's the exact equal distance from the bathroom to the kitchen...
...and it's at the perfect angle so you don't get any glare coming off of Stevie.
Stevie the TV?
Is there a problem? No.
Oh, what does he know?
Come on, Rosita. Us chicas gotta stick together.
You bitch.
Friends  S07E13  The One Where Rosita Dies
Hey, Ross?
So I was checking out the real-estate section.
Yeah. Look at this.
Oh, it looks like Mom and Dad's house.
Oh, it even has a tree with a broken limb out front.
And the, uh, window in the attic...
Oh, my God.
What? What happened to the window in the attic?
I can't believe Mom and Dad are selling the house.
I can't believe they didn't even tell us.
I can't believe I still don't know what happened to the window in the attic.
Okay, come on. Joey, I'll buy you a new one, all right?
We'll go down to the store right now and we'll get you a new chair.
She's not even cold yet.
But don't you think Rosita would've wanted you to move on?
I mean, you know, she did always put your comfort first.
That's true.
I can't believe we have to say goodbye to the house we grew up in.
Man, some stranger's gonna be living in my room.
Well, after 15 years of Morn and Dad keeping it as a shrine to you...
...it's time the velvet ropes came down.
They kept your room a while.
Oh, please. Dad turned my room into a gym 20 minutes after I moved out.
And I gotta say, a tanning bed and a stack of Victoria's Secret catalogs?
Not a gym.
Come on. You know they love you. As much as they love you?
I was their first born. They thought she was barren. It's not my fault.
Ugh. I hate this year.
What's wrong with this year?
It's already February and I've only given two massages...
...and they were both the worst tippers in the world.
That was me and Ross.
Oh, that's right.
Hey, y'know if you want to pick up some extra cash...
...some friends of mine made good money in college doing telemarketing.
Yeah, it'd probably be better than the last telephone job I had.
You know, I probably won't have to say "spank" as much.
What?
Oh, yeah, like you never called.
So, basically, this is very easy. You read from the script...
...and try to sell as much toner as you possibly can.
Okay, I can do that.
Oh, by the way, I love my office. Ha, ha.
Why don't we do a trial run? Oh, okay.
Um, all right.
Hi, this is Phoebe from Empire Office Supplies.
Can I speak to your supply manager, please?
I'm the supply manager.
Um, okay. I'd like to talk to you about your toner needs.
We don't need any toner. Well, I'm sorry to bother you. Bye-bye.
Yeah, you're right. This is easy.
Okay. What was wrong with that call?
Oh, well, all right.
Um, no offense, but you were kind of rude.
They're always gonna tell you they don't need toner, but that's okay.
Because whatever they say...
...you can find the answer to it, here in the script.
Oh. So I think you're ready to sell toner.
Do you have any last questions? No.
Oh, wait, yes, I do. I do have one question:
What is toner?
Joey?
JOe?
Full bag?
Beer's still cold.
Something terrible must have happened here.
Oh, no, no, no.
Stevie, I was never here.
Dad? I'm here.
Hey. Hi.
God, it seems like just yesterday you guys used to come out to watch me work.
Dad, we can't believe you're selling the house.
Well, It's time for a new family to start their memories here.
And hopefully their check will clear before they find the crack...
...in the foundation and the asbestos in the ceiling.
Let's just grab our stuff and get the hell out of here.
I'm sorry we can't store your childhood things anymore.
Oh, it's okay. I can't wait to see everything again. All the memories.
I don't know what's in the boxes down here.
But I do know that there are six or seven Easy-Bake Ovens in the attic.
I used to love to play restaurant.
Yeah, not as much as you loved to play "uncooked batter eater."
Hey. It is unreasonable to expect a child to wait for a light bulb to cook brownies.
So I think your boxes are over here.
Oh, great.
Hey...
...Dad, whose cigarettes are these?
I don't know.
They must be your mother's.
But please, please don't ask her. I'll throw these away.
Cool. Dad, my report cards.
Hey, check this out. Dad.
Math, A. Science, A. History, A. Gym...
Ooh, my rock polisher.
Uh-oh. What?
You know how the garage floods every spring?
How are you ever gonna sell this place?
I think I accidentally used Monica's boxes...
...to keep the water away from the Porsche.
Oh, no, Dad. Dad?
What the--?
Oh, God.
Everything's ruined.
Dad, she's gonna be crushed.
You don't secretly smoke, do you?
No.
So it's just your mother, then.
Hi. This is Phoebe from Empire Office Supplies.
Can I speak to your supply manager, please?
Earl. Thanks.
Hi, Earl. This is Phoebe from Empire Office Supplies.
I'd like to talk to you about your toner needs.
I don't need any toner.
I'm hearing what you're saying, but at our prices, everyone needs toner.
Not me.
May I ask why?
You want to know why?
You want to know why?
I surely do.
Okay-
I don't need any toner...
...because I'm gonna kill myself.
Um...
Is that because you're out of toner?
Okay, so no toner today. Thanks anyway. Bye-bye.
No, no, wait, wait. I can't just let you hang up.
Just please talk to me.
Well...
I only had one thing to do today.
I guess I could push it back.
Yeah. Now, why do you want to kill yourself?
I've been working for 10 years now at this...
...meaningless, dead-end job...
...and nobody here even knows that I exist.
Chandler?
I'm sorry?
Oh. Look...
...I'm sure that people know you exist.
Oh, yeah? I work in a cubicle surrounded by people.
I've been talking to you for five minutes now about killing myself...
...and no one's even looked up from their desk. Hang on.
Hey, everybody, uh...
...I'm gonna kill myself.
I got nothing.
Good chair.
Now, if anybody asks...
...your name is Rosita.
Poor thing. Cut down in her prime.
Joey, the new chair will be here in an hour.
Maybe we should actually move Rosita out of here, you know?
Start the healing process.
Yeah, I guess you're right. Okay.
She's healed.
That's weird. No, it's not weird.
It's a miracle.
It's not a miracle, Joey. I'm sure there's an explanation.
There is. If you want something enough and your heart is pure...
...wondrous things can happen.
Well, she'll understand, right? It's not like I did it on purpose.
Dad, that won't matter to her.
Look, all my stuff is safe and dry. And all her stuff is...
...growing new stuff.
See, this is exactly the kind of thing...
...that makes her think you guys love me more than you love her.
Oh, my God. Does she really think that?
Well, can you blame her?
I don't know. I suppose we may have favored you unconsciously.
You were a medical marvel.
The doctors said your mom couldn't-I don't want to hear about it.
Really? Well, not right now.
Okay, look. Monica came here for some memories.
Damn it, we're gonna give her some.
Okay, grab...
Grab some empty boxes, okay? We'll take stuff from mine...
...and whatever we can pass off as hers, we'll put them in there.
Right. Like, this. She could have made this.
This could have been hers. Sure.
You know, if you want to tell the medical marvel story while we work...
...that'd be fine.
I am so psyched I kept this chair for myself.
Yeah. Me too.
Wow, you know, that this thing has speakers in the headrest?
No, really? Yeah.
You can hook it up to your TV and you get radio.
My chair heals itself.
All right. Earl, let's just forget about the people at the office, okay?
There's gotta be someone else in your life that's worth sticking around for.
What about your family or friends? Or maybe a girlfriend?
Heh. Yeah, right.
Oh, sorry. Boyfriend?
Okay, I should...
I should probably be getting back to my thing now.
See you. No.
I'm not finished yet. Don't you dare hang up on me!
The new girl's good.
So which boxes are mine?
These are yours right here. Okay.
Oh, a coloring book. Yeah, yeah. Oh, you loved that thing.
You always had it with you. You never went anywhere without--
Without that coloring book.
Really?
Wow. Looks like I had some trouble staying inside the lines.
Uh-uh.
Wow, look at this.
I can't believe I even fit into this shirt.
Oh, this is yours.
I don't know how that got in there.
Hey, this isn't my stuff.
Ross, these are your boxes.
Where are my boxes?
The garage flooded, sweetie, and it ruined everything in your boxes.
I'm sorry.
Just mine? I'm afraid so.
So why wasn't Ross' stuff ruined?
I used your boxes to divert water away from the Porsche.
So wait. Ross' stuff is fine, but I have no memories...
...because you wanted to keep the bottom two inches of your car from water?
Well, there was also leaves and gook and stuff.
I can't believe this.
Screw it. I'm having one.
Hey, Chandler. Hey.
How would you like to sit in a chair that fully reclines...
...has a rolling massage...
...and speakers in the headrest?
Yeah, I'd love to, but I've tried that so many times...
...they won't even let me in the store anymore.
Well, what if I told you that you could do it in my apartment?
Are you telling me...
...that you bought the chair that is making all other lounge systems obsolete?
The chair that Sit Magazine called "Chair of the Year"?
I just purchased...
...the La-Z-Boy E-Cliner 3000.
Well, that's awesome. That's great. What made you do it?
Well, it's a long story, but I broke Joey's chair--
Whoa, whoa, whoa. You broke Joey's chair?
Yeah. I thought I broke Joey's chair.
That's why I replaced it with mine. Oh.
That's how it got fixed.
Well, what did you think? That elves came in and fixed it?
No.
Angels.
I'm getting my chair back. Hey.
Well, looks like it wasn't healed after all.
So I guess this chair's mine now.
Joey, you broke my chair!
Your chair?
Yeah, he thought he broke your chair, so he switched the chairs.
So there was no miracle? No, Joe. No miracle.
Oh, no. This is devastating.
My faith is shaken.
I'm so glad I have the new chair to get me through this difficult time in my life.
Excuse me, could you tell me where can I find Earl?
He's the supply manager here.
Sorry, I don't know any Earl.
I'm right here!
Earl?
I'm Phoebe. Phoebe?
The lady who sells toner?
Um, look, you can't kill yourself.
Look, urn, I really appreciate you coming down--
No, no, I can't let you do it.
Why?
Because it was fate that made me call you today.
I thought it was toner.
No. Think about it, okay? This isn't even my regular job, okay?
And my first day on the job, you're my first call.
And somebody else might have hung up on you, but I wouldn't do that...
...because I know about this stuff.
My morn killed herself. Really?
Yes. How?
I'm not gonna give you tips.
Look, don't you see that this--?
This all came together so that I could stop you from doing this.
Couldn't it just be a coincidence? No, it's fate.
It doesn't really seem like enough to be fate.
Oh, well. Um, okay, here's a weird thing.
My mother was also a supply manager.
I'm actually the office manager.
Oh, my God. So was she!
And get this, okay.
Your name is Earl, right? Her name was Pearl.
Pearl?
Was there anything else?
Sure.
Um, where are you from?
Philadelphia. Oh, my God, so was she!
Oh, I've got goose bumps.
Really?
Well, I'm wearing layers, and it's warm. Yeah.
But-Look. Okay. These jerks might not care about you...
...but the universe does, and that says a lot.
Did you hear that?
I don't need you guys to care about me...
...because the universe cares.
The whole universe!
I really wish they'd care just a little bit.
Oh, this is terrible.
Everything is destroyed.
Look at this.
It obviously meant enough for me to save it, and now I can't tell what it is.
It's still soft.
What do you think this is?
Mon, I think it was a mouse.
How are you, honey? How do you think I am?
You've wrecked all my childhood memories...
...you love Ross more than me.
And I just rubbed a dead mouse on my face.
Sweetheart, we love you just as much as Ross.
Now, I'm sorry about everything that happened...
...and I'll probably never be able to make it up to you...
...but here's a start.
What's this? It's the key to my Porsche.
Well, the key to your Porsche.
What? What?
I've been thinking of getting rid of it...
...and I was driving it the other day and I saw my reflection in a window.
Your mother's right, I do look like an ass.
You're giving it to me? You're kidding me, right?
Well, wait a minute.
I mean, a couple of stupid boxes get wet, and she gets a Porsche?
Why don't we take it for a spin? All right.
What about me? I'm a medical marvel!
Oh, yeah. Oh.
Hey, guys. Hey.
Know what happened to Chandler's Barcalounger?
Oh, yeah. Joey broke it. Had to get rid of it.
Are you kidding? I get a Porsche and the Barcaloungers gone?
Heh. This is the best day ever!
Happy birthday!
Happy birthday!
Rach, come on. Rach!
It's your birthday.
Hey.
She's not as pretty as she was when she was 29.
Ms. Green would like to establish some ground rules before she comes out.
She would appreciate it if you didn't use the words "old" or "downhill"...
...or "They still look pretty damn good."
They do.
Rachel, come on out.
Monica made breakfast.
Chocolate chip pancakes.
We've got presents.
Good ones?
They all came from the list you handed out to us two weeks ago.
Well, can I keep the presents and still be 29?
Come on, Rach, look, turning 3O is not that big a deal.
Oh, really? Is that how you felt when you turned 30?
Why, God, why?
We had a deal. Let the others grow old, not me.
Oh, come on, you guys, is it just me? Am I overreacting to this?
No, Rach, it is not just you. My 30th birthday certainly wasn't that much fun.
And now Chandler.
We're all getting so old.
Why are you doing this to us'?
Friends  S07E14  The One Where They All Turn Thirty
Rach, you're in a great place in your life. You have an amazing job, good friends.
Yeah, your roommate's a soap opera star.
Your character is in a coma.
I promised myself I wasn't gonna cry at this one.
I know my life's going pretty well, but I see so many people...
...who've accomplished so many of their goals by the time they're 30.
Yeah, but you shouldn't compare yourself to me.
Come on, Phoebe. You can do it Phoebe! Come on!
Come on. There you go.
I did it. One mile on a Hippity Hop.
That's it. That's everything I wanted to do before I was 30.
Oh, except I wanted to patch things up with my sister.
Oh, well. But, yaw.!
And, girls, this thing is a godsend, if you know what I mean. Heh.
Come on, let's have some fun, huh? What do you want to do today?
Nothing. I don't want to do anything.
Well, doing nothing on your 30th is better than doing something stupid, like Ross.
Hey, that was a practical purchase.
I needed that car for transportation.
Okay? I have a child.
How hot do I look in this, huh?
Ross, a sports car?
Wouldn't it be cheaper to just stuff a sock down there?
That's not what this is about, okay?
I am a sports car enthusiast.
I've always been into cars. What's the horsepower on this thing?
I don't know, but look how shiny.
I can't believe you bought this. So can I have a ride, stud?
Hop in.
Get ready for the smoothest ride of your life.
Damn it.
Okay, who's next?
You know what? I am gonna do something today.
I'm not just gonna sit around like some old lady.
I want to get something pierced.
Like my, uh, nose or my tongue or something.
Really? Because, you know, that hurts.
So what? You know, the way I see it--
Ow! Son of a bitch.
Look, Rachel, I know what you're going through.
I'm totally freaked out about turning 25.
Get out, get out of my apartment.
Rach, for what it's worth, I think that you're doing great.
I mean, y'know let's face it, no one handles this well.
Heh. Least of all you.
Would you put that back on. Monica's gonna be here any minute.
But it hurts my Joey's apple.
Okay, for the last time, it's not named after each individual man.
You've done a wonderful job with this party, Chandler.
Everything looks so lovely. Oh, well, not as lovely as you.
I mean, I can't believe you would have a 30-year-old daughter.
And you, I can't believe you would have a tux that's 30 years old.
It's older than that. Ross was actually conceived right near this tuxedo.
Oh.
Okay, everybody hide. I saw her. She's coming.
Okay, okay. Everybody down. Everybody down.
Okay, everybody stay here. I will find out what's going on.
Hey, you got the door open.
Hey, are you drunk?
No.
0Kay.
Whoa.
0Kay.
See I was, I was a little nervous about turning...
...30.
So the busboys took me out for some drinks.
Might want to puke on you later.
Okay, here's the thing. We have thrown a very formal surprise party for you in there!
All your friends are in there and your parents.
No. Yes.
No. Yes.
Oh, no. My parents have never seen me drunk.
That they know of.
Okay, Here's the thing. We'll get you some coffee and they will never know that you're drunk.
Really, you promise? Yeah, I'll take care of it.
Okay, I love you so much.
Okay, we have to do something about your breath.
What about your breath?
That's still yours.
Okay, now, remember, it's a surprise party.
So when you go in, act surprised.
Okay. Okay. Shh.
Ready?
Surprise!
Okay, forward. Forward.
Stop!
Okay, back-Stop!
Okay, for-Stop! Stop! Stop!
Okay. Okay, here's what we're gonna do.
I'm gonna break into this minivan, put it in neutral.
You guys push it forward so Ross can drive out of the spot.
Okay? All right. Here we go.
Haul ass!
Happy 30th birthday. Here.
It's for the child in you. And the woman.
Happy 30th.
Right, Why do you keep saying that?
Because it's our 30th birthday.
Yeah, no, we're not 30. We're 31. Okay.
Wait.
Oh, it's you.
Yeah. What?
Yeah, we're not 30. We're 31.
Yuh-huh. That's what it says on my birth certificate.
You have your birth certificate?
Yeah, I got a big box of family stuff when my mom died.
Our mom.
Right. Okay.
Do you have my birth certificate? No, I sold it to a Swedish runaway.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, we are 31.
Yeah.
I just lost a whole year of my life.
0Kay.
Your middle name is Pamela? Yes.
Oh, I never knew mine. Do you remember what it is?
Yes. Phoebe.
That's my first name. Right. Okay. Then, no.
Look at that. We made it all the way across the room. You're doing great.
What's going on? Monica's a little drunk.
Yay, I love drunk Monica.
Oh, she's so much more fun than regular Monica.
She doesn't want her parents to know she's drunk.
Oh, all right, all right. Here's what we'll do.
I'll get twice as drunk as Monica and then no one's even gonna notice her.
What's going on?
Monica's wasted.
Maybe that'll liven up this party.
Okay, will you just go help her get changed, please?
Okay, but taking care of a drunk, naked woman seems like a job for Joey.
Yep.
This one's from me. Ah.
It wasn't on your list, but hopefully you'll think it's really fun.
A scooter.
Stick to the list.
Always stick to the list.
No, no, no, I love it. Thank you.
Okay, open ours next. Open ours next.
Now that you're a couple, we don't get two presents from you guys?
For my last birthday, you gave me a hug.
Okay, read the card, read the card. Okay.
"Happy birthday, Grandma.
It's better to be over the hill...
...than buried under it.
All our love, Monica and Chandler." That's funny.
No, no, no, no. That was a joke.
No, I know, I get it. It's funny.
No, because you're not a grandmother.
No I know, because to be a grandmother, you have to be married and have children.
and I don't have any of those things. That's why it's so funny.
I'm just gonna go...
All you had to do was buy the card.
Okay, you know what?
I realized it was stupid to get upset about not having a husband and kids.
All I really needed was a plan.
See, I wanna have three kids.
Let me guess. And you want to have them all at the same time...
...and you want to have them for your brother. Ha, ha.
As I was saying...
I should probably have the first of the three kids by the time I'm 35, right?
Which gives me five years.
So if I wanna have a kid when I'm 35, I don't have to get pregnant until I'm 34.
Which gives Prada four years to start making maternity clothes.
Oh, wait, but I do want to be married for a year before I get pregnant.
Really? That long?
Look all you want, it's happening.
So I don't have to get married until I'm 33.
That's three years. That's three whole years.
Oh, wait a minute though.
I'll need a year and a half to plan the wedding.
And I'd like to know the guy for like a year, year and a half...
...before we get engaged.
Which means I need to meet the guy by the time I'm 30.
Which is fine, because you just turned...
...28.
No, Ross. No, it is not fine.
According to my plan, I should already be with the guy that I'm gonna marry.
Will you quit hogging it'?
Oh, I'm telling you, it's like watching Bambi learn how to walk.
You're drunk.
Mom and Dad are gonna be mad.
Maybe I'm a little drunk.
Hey. Are those crab cakes?
Did I not tell you to come straight to me when more crab cakes were ready?
How you feeling?
You are so handsome.
I want to make love to you right here, right now.
I really wish that you wouldn't.
All you have to do is just get through a little bit more, okay?
Then we can put you in bed, okay? Just smile and don't talk to anyone.
Speech, speech. Let's hear from the birthday girl, huh?
Pheebs.
Don't you see, everybody's looking at me.
The plan's working.
I didn't even have to take off my top yet.
Speech. Come on, speech.
Come on. Speech.
Hey, Chandler, you can't keep your hands off her for one second.
Oh, I think it's nice.
I think it's necessary.
I wanna thank you all for coming.
My family and my friends.
I'd really like to say that I'm, um...
You know what I'd really like to say?
I'm drunk.
That's right, Morn and Dad.
Your little "Harmomica" is hammered.
And guess what? I've been drunk before.
And I've smoked a cigarette.
But you know what? You know what?
It's all okay. It's okay, because I turned 3O today.
And I can do anything I want.
Because I am a grownup.
Okay, quick. Help me get this off. Yeah.
I lost a whole year.
I can't believe it. This is so unfair.
Come on, Pheebs, it'll be okay.
Will it? Will it?
How would you feel if you found out you were 31?
That's not gonna happen, you know, because we have a new deal.
Plus, it totally ruined my schedule.
I haven't done any of the things I wanted to do by the time I was 31.
Like what? Like, okay...
...I haven't met any Portuguese people.
I haven't had the perfect kiss.
And I haven't been to sniper school.
Phoebe, y'know why don't we go upstairs and have some birthday cake?
No, I just feel like being by myself for a while, all right? I'll see you guys later.
Thanks.
Oh, poor Pheebs.
Hey, you know what, you guys? I think I'm gonna go walk her home.
Oh, man. What?
He's gonna eat the cake.
Pheebs. Wait up.
Listen, I...
Close your eyes.
Maybe that's one you can cross off your list.
Oh, yeah. Heh.
Oh, and plus, I'm one-sixteenth Portuguese.
Okay, is everybody clear? We're gonna pick it up...
...and move it.
All we need is teamwork, okay? We're gonna lift the car...
...and slide it out.
Lift...
...and slide.
Ross, I really don't think this-Lift...
...and slide.
Okay, here we go. All right, everyone.
Lift...
...and slide.
Hey, Joey-Oh, come on, Rach, my turn just started.
Actually, I just want to talk to Tag.
Oh, okay. Hey, can I ride this outside?
Whatever, okay? I'm not your mother. Okay.
Not in the street! Yeah.
Hey. Hey.
How you doing, you feeling any better? Yeah, I'm doing okay. I'm, um...
Let's talk. Okay.
Um... What's up?
Uh, Tag, um...
You're such a great guy, and we have so much fun together.
but I don't-I don't... Wait.
I think I see where you're going.
But before you say anything else, can I just say one more thing?
Well said.
And a, uh, good example of the fun I was referring to.
Uh, but, heh, I just think I'm past the point where I can, you know, just have fun.
Rachel, don't do this. This is just because you're turning 30.
Yeah, it is.
But you're just a kid. I mean, you're 25.
Twenty-four, actually. Oh, God.
You know what I wish? I wish you were six years older.
Well, actually, if I'm wishing for stuff, I actually wish I was six years younger.
Me too. Yeah. I'm sorry.
Hey, how'd it go?
Oh.
If I only want two kids, can I keep him for another year?
You did the right thing.
I don't like this anymore.
Well, here we are. Just a bunch of 30-year-olds.
Wow, do you realize in 10 years we're gonna be 40?
Why, God? Why are you doing this to us'?
Yes. My baby's finally free.
All right.
Start it up. Let's go.
Whoa-how.!
How hot are we?
You wanna buy a car?
So thanks for coming by, guys.
We wanted to bounce some ideas off of you about the wedding ceremony.
Oh.
What's the matter? Are you okay? Yeah, it's just...
Monica said "wedding."
Uh, so we wanted to know if one of you would like to read something during the ceremony.
Okay, yeah, I guess, I guess I can do that too.
Too?
Yeah, I kind of, ahem, have something else planned for you guys.
Do you mind telling us what it is? Sorry.
I'm kind of keeping this one on the QT.
Well, whatever it is, I hope it involves winking.
Hey. Hey.
So I just talked to one of the DOOL writers today,
What is DOOL? Days Of Our Lives.
Anyway, you're not gonna believe it. My character is coming out of his coma!
That's wonderful. Wow, Joey.
And not only that. I'm getting a new brain!
So great things are happening at work and in your personal life.
What do you mean you're getting a new brain?
They're killing off one of the characters, and when she dies...
...and her brain is being transplanted into my body.
Heh, what? A brain transplant?
It's ridiculous.
I think it's ridiculous that you haven't had sex in three and a half months.
It's winter. There are fewer people on the street.
Who are they killing off?
Uh, Cecilia Monroe. She plays Jessica Lockhart.
No! No!
She is so good at throwing drinks in people's faces.
I don't think I've ever seen her finish a beverage.
The way she slaps people. Wouldn't you love to do that?
Don't do it.
And she's been on the show forever.
It's gonna be really hard to fill her shoes. Yeah.
Help me out here. When you--
When you come out of the "brain transplant"...
...you are going to be her?
Yes, but in Drake Ramoray's body.
Why is this so hard for you to get? I thought you were a scientist.
Friends  S07E15  The One With Joey's New Brain
Rash, so that guy there:
Straight or gay?
Oh, yeah, he's too cute to be straight. Ha, ha.
Ooh, Knockers will help us figure it out.
All right, straight.
And not subtle.
He left his cell phone. Oh?
Oh, well, We could hand it to Gunther, he'll put it in lost and found.
Or we could use it to call China, see how those guys are doing.
What if, uh, he calls his own cell phone to find out who found it, and I answer...
...and we start talking and we fell in love?
I mean wouldn't that be a great story?
Kind of like a fairy tale for the digital age. Yeah.
That does sound great. I'm gonna get the phone.
What? Wait. Why do you get the story?
I don't know. I haven't been out on a date in so long.
Phoebe, you had a date three days ago.
That wasn't a date. That was, That was just friends getting together and having sex.
Okay. Great. See, I get the phone.
No way! No way! You just broke up with Tag a week ago.
Yeah, and until now, I didn't think I would love again.
Nice try. Hey, wait.
How do we fairly decide who gets the phone?
I don't know.
Well, um...
Maybe we could, uh...
Ah-ha! Too slow! Ha-ha-ha.
Ah-ha! Too cocky.
I'm going to keep dating him Mother, and there's nothing you can do about it!
Yes, there is.
What are you going to do? Kill him? Like you did with Charles?!
Oh, my baby.
Cut!
That was a great scene. And that slap looked so real. How do you do that?
Oh, just years of experience. Can I get some ice here?
Anyway, I just wanted to say how wonderful I think you are.
You're not the fan who's dying, are you?
No. No, uh, I'm Joey Tribbiani. We did a scene together yesterday.
I'm the guy in the coma. Oh, that was a real person?
An-an-anyway I-I just wanted to say, since I'm getting your brain when you leave the show...
...I was wondering if there was any tips you can give me... I'm leaving the show?
I don't know, why? Did you hear something?
Who told you that? Oh, uh...
Oh uh, One of the writers. Which one? Was it bald or was it tall?
You know, it doesn't matter, because it is not true.
Okay. Whoo, eh.
And if it were true, how dare you come to me and ask me for tips...
...about a character I've been playing for 20 years! I'll give you a tip!
Miss Monroe-Oh, there you go.
Okay, look, I have an idea.
Why don't we, Why don't we see what kind of numbers he has on his speed dial'?
And then from that, we can tell who has more in common with him...
...and whoever does gets the phone.
Fine. All right. All right.
First name on the speed dial is "Mom." Oh.
I lost my mom to suicide.
Okay, no way.
You can't use that to get the cute guy and the last muffin.
Did I use that already today? I'm sorry.
"Ben, Carlos, David--"
Oh, I win. He's got Barney's on his speed dial.
So? You don't know that it's Barney's the store.
That could be y'know his friend's house, or a bar, or--
Who has Barney's the store on their speed dial?
His new girlfriend.
What is that?
I think it's the Dying Cat Parade.
Sounds like it's coming from across the street.
Oh, my God. What?
Y'know that thing that Ross was gonna do at our wedding?
He was hanging out with me yesterday and he turned to me and said, "You're half Scottish, right?"
No. There is no way. It cannot be Ross.
Unbelievable. Why is your family Scottish?
Why is your family Ross?
He cannot play at our wedding. I mean everyone will leave.
I mean, come on. That is just noise!
It's not even a song.
Wait. If you listen very carefully, I think...
...it's "Celebration" by Kool and the Gang.
You're absolutely right. They are writing me out of the show.
They don't know exactly when it's going to happen, but apparently it's soon...
...and then that's it.
I'm sorry. If it was up to me, you would never leave the show.
Yeah, thanks. No, I mean it.
I can't believe they'd do this to you. And to your fans.
They're gonna be devastated. Heartbroken. They love you so much.
Oh, you're right.
Thank you.
What's your name again? Uh
Joey. Joey. Well, thank you.
That is so sweet. Oh.
The-The only reason that I, that I came up to you before...
...was because, well...
...because I'm really nervous about being you.
You know, if you could help me capture the essence of the character.
Y'know? Help me keep Jessica alive. Please?
All right, Joey, I will help you.
Not because I owe it to this stupid show...
...but because I owe it to Jessica.
Oh, that's great. Thank you so much. You're so welcome.
I've been watching some tapes. How's this?
Jessica Lockhart will never step foot in this place again!
Ever!
Oh, but, Jessica doesn't have an English accent.
I can do an English accent?
That baby's going on my resume.
Hi, Pheebs. How are you? Good.
Um, Phoebe, remember when we were in the coffeehouse...
...we decided I was gonna keep the cute guy's phone?
Yeah. And remember how I said I was gonna keep it in my purse...
...so that if it rang, I could just pick it up? Yeah.
And then do you remember going into my purse and stealing the phone?
Ooh, now you lost me.
You stole the phone. No, I didn't.
No? So you're saying that if I called it, it wouldn't ring?
No. Hmm. Okay.
Umm, okay. But while you dial, let me show you the features of my new ringing handbag.
Oh, it does work.
Phoebe. That is a different phone.
Oh, is it? Hello. Yes, hi. ls Rachel there?
Yes, she is. Just one moment, please. It's for me!
That is damning evidence. Ugh.
Oh, my God. I bet that's him.
My digital fairy tale's about to begin.
It's ri--
Would you stop doing that?
Hello? Yes, I'm the one who found your phone.
Phoebe, you can't do th-Shh, I'm on a call.
Well, yeah, I mean, you could pick it up tonight. Say, 8:30?
At my apartment. It's, um--
It's, um, 5 Morton Street, apartment 14.
And then maybe, you know, after, we could grab a bite to eat or whatever.
Okay. Okay, I'll see you then. Bye.
You do know that I will be here when he comes over.
Oh, and how will you know what time to come over?
You just said it.
Joey, the essence of the character is rooted in her confidence.
So when Jessica enters a room, for instance...
...she owns everything...
...and every person in that room.
You try it. Okay.
Right. Well, he's not mad at the room.
Try it again. He owns it. He owns the room.
It is his. He owns, owns, owns the room! He owns it!
It's a little weird, but it's getting better.
Oh, I'm gonna miss this woman so much. I don't know what I'm gonna do.
It's been 20 years of my life.
Hey, hey. Maybe-Maybe, uh-Maybe this is a good thing.
You know? It'll give you a chance to shake things up. Play different characters.
You're so talented.
Probably should've just left years ago when the offers were pouring in...
...but, you know, I just got so comfy here and...
Ugh, I turned down some amazing work.
Like what? Well...
...let's just say if I'd left 15 years ago...
...the landscape of Mexican cinema would be very different today.
Wow.
But, well, now... Now's a different time for me.
Oh, hey, come on. Don't, uh-Don't do this.
Let me tell you something, okay?
Now when I watch you do a scene, I'm thinking, "Boy, she is a great actress."
But-But I'm also thinking, "She is hot."
You think I'm hot?
You own the room.
We-We should probably get the...
Oh, yeah. Yeah, we should get--
So when Jessica kisses a man...
...she usually puts, um...
...both her hands on the man's face.
Yeah, I notice that. Is that because she's so passionate?
No, it's because that way the camera only sees her.
You want to try it?
Yeah, okay.
That was good. That was really good.
But I think that maybe your hands are just a little off.
They should be, maybe-Like, right-Mm.
Well, I feel like a snack.
Do you want some shortbread? It's Scottish, like you are.
Oh, no, thanks. I don't like anything from my Scottish heritage.
What?
Well, it's just that my entire family was run out of Scotland by...
...Vikings.
Oh well, it sounds to me like your family's ready to, uh, rediscover its Scottish roots.
You can't play bagpipes at the wedding!
How did you know about that?
We heard you play all the way from your apartment.
Were you the ones who called the cops?
That's not really important right now. Ahem.
What is important is, while we appreciate the gesture...
...we just don't feel that bagpipes are appropriate for our wedding.
Why not? Because we hate them.
Just give me a chance to perform for you, and then decide whatever you want.
I'm not gonna tell you what song I'm gonna play, either. But, uh...
...let's just say when it's over...
...I'll bet there'll be a wee bit 0' celebration.
Hey, hey!
Who is it?
Hi, It's Tom.
I'm hereto pick up the phone. Ah!
Whoa, why do you get to answer the door?
Why shouldn't I? Because it's my apartment.
Well, then I get to give him the phone.
Okay. Good luck explaining all the calls to China.
Hi.
Wow, how long were we arguing for?
You're not the man who left the cell phone.
No, that's my assistant. Is he coming?
Um, no.
Could you, uh, give us one second?
Sure. We'll be right back, sir.
Well, what do we do? I don't know.
Can you believe this?
We were waiting for a hot guy and an even hotter one shows up.
I know--
What?
Rachel, listen...
...if you let me have him, then I will really owe you one.
All right.
All right, All right Phoebe, I will let you have him.
But you owe me. You owe me big.
So which one of you lovely ladies am I gonna take to dinner, huh?
Oh, that'd be me, sir.
After you. Okay, thank you.
Nice.
Well, you certainly own that room.
Actually, I rent the whole place.
And I just got what you meant. Thank you.
Hi. Hey.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Aah! Jessica Lockhart! In my apartment!
I am such a huge fan. I am such a huge fan.
Well, it's nice to know that--
Monica! Monica!
That, uh-That's my roommate, Rachel.
Oh, that explains all the women's underwear.
Sure. Yeah.
Oh, my God, it's true!
Oh, my God.
Can I just ask you to do me-Aw. just one favor?
Certainly.
Would you slap me? Would you slap me right here in the face?
I'd love to, but my lawyer said I can't do that anymore.
All right, here we go. Okay.
No, wait. Just one moment. Um--
You're a stupid bitch. I really can't slap you.
My God, you're great. Thanks for stopping by. See you.
I am so sorry about that. Oh, no, no, no.
Being adored, I'm used to it. Don't worry about it.
Oh, my God. What?
They sent me today's script. They never send me the script.
They don't? Well, no, I'm just in a coma.
This must mean I have lines.
How does it happen?
You get thrown from a horse into an electric fence.
A what? Jessica hates horses.
I'm guessing after this she's not gonna be crazy about electricity, either.
Loosening the saddle on Mother's horse was brilliant, Fredrick.
And the electric fence, inspired.
Thank you, sweetheart.
I can't believe she's really gone.
Look around you. All of this is ours.
I don't think so.
Who are you?
What's the matter, Dina?
Don't you recognize your own...
...mother?
Cut! That was great, everybody. Thank you.
That was so wonderful!
Oh, I think that you're a better Jessica than I ever was.
Oh, no. Of course not, but you were very good.
Heh, thanks.
Guess what? Good news. I got another job.
Great. Hey, all right! What is it?
A film in Guadalajara.
The airport?
No, that's LaGuardia.
This is Mexico. Oh, wow.
Well, how long will you be gone?
Eight months.
That's a really long time. Yeah, but you could come and visit me.
I bet that you could, uh, own a few places down there.
Oh, you know, I should probably buy a place in the city first.
And I just got what you meant again. That is a--
I'll tell you, that's a tricky one. It's a tricky one.
Well...
Good luck.
You too.
Ahem. Okay, now, uh, remember, I'm still learning.
One, two, three, four!
You know the song. Sing along.
So?
No! No!
Hi. Hi! Hi, Ben.
Hi. We have a little bathroom emergency.
Oh, yeah. Go ahead. Okay, uh, before we do...
...uh, are any of Joey's special romance magazines in there?
No. No. Okay, all clear.
Thanks,Phoebe.
That's Rachel.
But whatever. Mm-hm.
Hey listen can you do me a big favor?
The, uh, dean's office called and said there was an urgent meeting.
Can you watch Ben for an hour?
Well, What-what about Monica? Uh, she isn't home.
So it would just be me alone?
Well, Ben would be there. No.
What's the matter? Well, uh, you know, it's just, uh...
I've never done that before. Me and him, alone.
He's not an ex-con.
Okay, okay, okay. Um...
What do I, What do I do with him? I don't know, Just-just talk to him.
Entertain him. Keep him alive.
Okay. Okay, Ben, come here.
All right, I'm gonna leave you here with Aunt Rachel for about an hour, okay?
Are you gonna be okay?
Yeah I think so. I wasn't talking to you.
Friends  S07E16  The One With The Truth About London
What about the second minister we meet with? I kind of liked him.
You mean the spitter? Come on. He wasn't that bad.
Easy for you to say, you'd be wearing a veil.
what about the third guy? You mean the guy who kept staring at your chest.
Can you blame him?
Sorry, I just don't like the idea of me saying, "I do"...
...he's thinking, "I'd do it too."
Well, then we still have a problem. With what?
Well, we're trying to find someone to perform our wedding...
...and they're all either boring or annoying...
...or can't stop staring at the ladies.
Ooh, you should have one of us do it.
Phoebe, We're getting "married" married, not "6th-grade" married.
No! No! it's a real thing.
Anyone can get ordained on the Internet and perform weddings and stuff.
I call it!
What? It was my idea!
Thank you very much, but neither of you is marrying us.
Does calling it not mean anything anymore?
We are going to having a legitimate clergy member.
And when I say legitimate, I mean gay...
...and in control of his saliva.
Ben, you know, when, uh-When you were a baby...
...you and I used to hang out all the time.
Because I was, I was your daddy's girlfriend.
But you're not anymore.
No, I'm not. Because you guys were on a break--
Hey, we were not on a Okay.
When's my daddy coming back? Fifty-two minutes.
So no brothers or sisters, huh?
But You know what, I had two sisters and we just tortured each other.
Really? Like how? Well, you know, we would, um...
We'd repeat everything the other said...
...or, uh, we'd jump out of closets to scare each other...
...or, ha, switch the sugar for the salt so they put salt on their cereal.
That's a good one.
Yeah, you like that one? Yeah, you're funny.
I'm funny?
Oh, thank God.
Well, hey, I got a ton of these.
Um, you, uh-You take a quarter...
You take a quarter...
...and you blacken the edge, right?
And then you say to person, "I bet you can't roll this quarter...
...from your forehead to your chin without it leaving your face."
And when they do it, they're left with a big black pencil line right down the center of their face.
Can I do it to you?
Yeah, I'm funny, Ben, but I'm not stupid.
Heh, okay?
So did you, uh, find anyone to marry you guys yet?
No, but "Horny for Monica" minister called...
...wanting to know if we're still together.
We'll never find anybody. Then let me do it.
Joe-No-no-no! Look, I've been thinking about it.
I'm an actor right? so I won't get nervous talking in front of people.
I won't spit and I won't stare at Monica's breasts.
Y'know? Everyone knows I'm an ass man.
That is true. Yeah and the most important thing...
...is it won't be some like, stranger up there who barely knows you.
It'll be me. And I swear, I'll do a really good job.
Plus, y'know I love you guys and it would really mean a lot to me.
Might be kind of cool.
So I can do it? Yeah, you can do it.
All right! Okay!
Okay-okay, I gotta get started on my speech.
Wait a minute.
Internet ministers can still have sex right? Yeah.
Coming.
I have a bone to pick with you.
Yes! Ben learned a little trick.
Oh yeah? did he pull the old--? That's right, that's right.
Saran wrap on the toilet seat...
...so the pee goes everywhere.
Oh, that. Yeah, that.
You know I hate practical jokes.
They're mean, they're stupid and I don't want my son learning them.
Oh, come on. Saran wrap on the toilet seat? you don't think that just a little funny?
I was barefoot. Oh.
Now tell me, the toilet thing is the only thing you taught him, right?
Yes.
Hey. Say hello to Reverend Joey Tribbiani.
You did it! You got ordained? Yeah.
Just got off the Internet. Man, there's a lot of porn out there.
Our minister.
Anyway, I started working on what I'm going to say for the ceremony. Want to hear it?
Okay. Yeah. Now-now, Listen, this is just the first draft, so...
"We are gathered here today on this joyous occasion...
...to celebrate the special love that Monica and Chandler share.
Huh? Right.
It is a love based on giving and receiving...
...as well as having and sharing.
And the love that they give and have is shared and received.
And through this having and giving...
...and sharing and receiving...
...we too can share and love and have...
...and receive."
Should we call the spitter?
Ha! Hey, Rachel. Hi.
What a surprise. What are you doing here?
Well y'know I was just in the neighborhood...
...and I passed by your building and thought to myself, "What's up with Carol...
...and sweet little Ben?"
That's nice. Well, uh, come on in. Okay.
Um, I'll make some coffee and, uh, we can chat.
I'd love that. I would love that.
So, uh-So where is sweet little Ben?
I would love to have a little--
I found him!
Very funny. Come here.
That is exactly why I've come here to talk to you, okay?
Rach, you want some sugar in your coffee? Yes, but--
Do I want sugar in my coffee?
No, just some milk would be good, Carol. Thanks.
Okay. Remember all that stuff I taught you yesterday?
"Remember all that stuff I taught you yesterday?"
Don't do that. "Don't do that."
Seriously, your dad doesn't like pranks. "Seriously, your dad doesn't like pranks."
Oh, damn it. "Oh, damn it!"
No! Don't say that.
Damn it! Go back to repeating.
Damn it! Oh, crap.
"Oh, crap!" Oh.
Okay you guys, I got a little more written. Are you ready?
Yeah, okay.
"When I think of the love that these two givers and receivers share...
...I can't help but envy the lifetime ahead of having and loving...
...and giving--" And then I can't think of a good word for right here.
How about "receiving"? Yes!
See, Joe, not that that's not great...
...but one of the cool things about having somebody we know perform the ceremony...
...is that it can be about us.
Y'know, It can be more personal. You can tell stories about us.
Ooh! Ooh! Okay, Maybe I'll talk about London. You know, when you two hooked up.
Only I won't say "hooked up"...
...I'll say, "began their beautiful journey...
There you go. ...by doing it."
Joe. Okay, all right, um...
So, uh-So how did it happen? Did your eyes meet across the room...
...And then the next thing y'know you're in the bathtub together and she's feeding you strawberries?
Isn't that what happened with you and the bride's maid? Yeah!
I call that "London style."
No that is not what happened with us.
Ooh, but maybe you should say it is, because "London style" sounds nice.
Yeah.
Okay, uh...
Well, I was umm, I was really sad that night because this guy thought I was Ross' mom.
And then Chandler was really sweet and he consoled me...
...and we drank too much. Yeah, baby.
I was a perfect gentleman and I walked her to her hotel room and said good night.
But then, later that night-Yeah, baby.
Hey.
Cute P.J.s. Really living it up here in London, huh?
Well I was...I wasn't exactly expecting company after...
9:15.
Is Joey here?
Last I saw him he was heading out the door with the bridesmaid and a bucket of strawberries.
So, uh, you're not still upset about what that guy told you, are you?
Wouldn't you be?
Well, look it's been a really emotional time y'know, and you've had a lot to drink...
You have to let that go, okay?
I mean you were the most beautiful woman in the room tonight.
Really?
You kidding? You're the most beautiful woman in most rooms--
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What's going on? You and I just made out!
You and I just made out! Not anymore.
But we don't do that. I know, I thought it would be fun.
How drunk are you?
Drunk enough to know that I want to do this. Not so drunk that you should feel guilty about taking advantage.
That's the perfect amount.
You know what's weird? What?
This doesn't feel weird. I know.
You're a really good kisser. Well, I have kissed over four women.
Do you wanna get under the covers? Mm-hm.
0Kay.
Wow, you are really fast!
It bodes well for me that speed impresses you.
We're gonna see each other naked. Yep.
Do you wanna do it at the same time? Count of three?
One, two, three.
Well, I think it's safe to say our friendship is effectively ruined.
Eh, we weren't that close anyway. Eh.
Joey, Joey, Joey. It's Joey.
Hey.
Hey, Joe. I was just watching a movie...
Oh, dude, I'm so sorry.
No! No! No!
Hey no-no-no-no! It's cool, It's cool! I'll only be a second,I'm still with my bridesmaid.
I just—Where are the condoms you brought?
They're in my bag over there.
...could you leave me one?
For just you?
Yeah.
All right. There you go, buddy.
Go nuts.
That's what that was?
Can you imagine if I hadn't left you that last one?
You two might've never gotten together.
Oh, ooh. Can you imagine if I had sent that hooker up to the room like I was gonna?!
It's like it was in the stars. Hmm.
Yeah, totally meant to be.
Tell him who you originally wanted to hook up with that night.
What? What?
What?
Who did you originally want to hook up with?
Okay, fine, but please don't be upset.
Okay? I was really depressed, okay? And really drunk.
I just wanted something stupid and meaningless. I just wanted...just sex. So
when I went to your room that night...
...I was actually looking for Joey.
Yeah, baby.
No, baby.
Oh, my God.
You came to the room looking for Joey?
Were you planning on telling me this? No, I didn't think it was important.
It's not important? It's not important?
If it wasn't for a bridesmaid, you'd be marrying him not me!
No! Do you know how unbelievably glad I am that Joey wasn't there that night!
Hey!
I'm a man of the cloth but I still have feelings.
Look there's no way you're doing this wedding now, okay?
What? That's not fair. It's not my fault.
I was off with my bridesmaid.
And who's to say I would've said yes?
I mean, I would've said yes.
Chandler look y-y-you are making way too big a deal out of this. all right?
Everything worked out okay.
It's just weird,
Okay? I don't want to be standing their saying my vows and then having the mental image of you and Monica.
I need-I don't know what I need. I need a walk.
Wait, Chandler, come on, it's not a big deal. It is to me.
You wanted to sleep with Batman and instead you had to settled for Robin.
This is crazy. No, Robin is so gay.
So now what have we agreed? No more pranks.
What else? You and Daddy were not on a break.
Very good.
Rachel, what are you doing here?
I'm just visiting my good friend Carol.
Your good friend? Yeah.
What's her last name?
Carol...
...Lesbian. Nice.
By the way, that, uh-That line down my face...
The line that prompted a student in my last class of the day to say:
"Dude, don't you ever wash your face?"
All right, I'm sorry. I'm sorry I didn't tell you.
I will be! Listen, I don't want you teaching my son that stuff anymore.
Okay? Fine. Fine.
but I'll have you know that once I taught him that stuff, he called me "fun Aunt Rachel."
And I loved being fun Aunt Rachel.
I'm glad you guys were bonding but--
Look, he doesn't have any brothers or sisters,
Somebody has to teach him this stuff.
And I haven't taught him anything a normal 6-year-old doesn't know anyway!
Crap! I gotta go_
Hey. Hey.
You want this scone? It came for me but it would probably rather sleep with you.
Come on Nothing even happened.
I just-I don't want you to be upset.
How can I not be upset?
Okay,I finally fall in love with this fantastic woman...
...and it turns out that she wanted you first.
Yeah, for like a half an hour one night.
Chandler, she wants you for the rest of her life.
We look at you and we see you together, and it just...
It fits, you know?
And you just know it's gonna last forever.
That's what you should say.
What?
When you're marrying us, that's what you should say.
Really? I could do it?
I'd love it if you would do it.
Hey.
But those are the words. Those exact words.
Well, I don't remember exactly...but
...it's pretty much about having and giving and sharing and receiving.
Hey. Hey.
So you guys doing okay? Yeah.
We talked and Monica made me see that I over reacted a little bit.
Some things in life are more important. Yeah, baby.
I'm really glad you guys are okay, but I just keep thinking...
...what would've happened if you two had hooked up.
Honey, dinner's ready!
What's my little chef got for me tonight?
Your favorite. Ho, ho, ho.
Fried stuff with cheese.
And lots of it!
Thanks, sweetheart.
Give me a little sugar. Okay.
You wanna go--?
Here we go, here we go, here we go.
How you doing?
Hey. Hey!
I'm sorry to do this again, but is there any way you can look after Ben for a bit?
I've got this meeting at school...
...and he asked for his "fun Aunt Rachel."
Well, of course I will watch him.
We have fun, don't we, Ben?
Okay. See you later, pal. Okay.
Wait a minute. Ben, I can't do it. What?
You got something on your back. What?
That's great. That is great.
What did we just finish talking about, Ben?
"What did we just finish talking about, Ben?"
All right, That's it! Come—you—no!
You're in big trouble, young man! No, wait.
Ben, come here! I am not kidding!
No you guys, hold it. Seriously--
Oh, my God! my God!
So the wedding caterer sent me this list of 12 appetizers. I have to narrow down it to six.
Food? Oh, give me.
So did Monica tell you about this great band called the Swing Kings that we're trying to get to play at the wedding?
Since when are you into swing music?
Oh since forever. I used to go all over town listening to bands.
Chandler. Gap commercial.
So did you book them? Did you call? I will.
You want me to call? No. I'll do it. You just stick to your job.
What is your job? Staying out of the way.
This is impossible Monica, Why don't you just pick all 15?
There were only 12. Oh, yeah, I added three.
What are "peanut-butter fingers"?
Friends  S07E17  The One With The Cheap Wedding Dress
Well, hello.
She's cute.
Should we go try to talk to her?
Sure. That's one of the great thing about being engaged, I'm not nervous to talk to pretty girls anymore.
Could you guys help me?
Yeah, let me get that for you.
It's really heavy. I got it.
So hi, I'm Ross, and this is my friend, Chandler.
I'm Kristen.
Kristen. Hi. Are you new to the area?
Because if you are, I'd love to show you around sometime.
I actually just moved from four blocks over. Oh.
But this block is like a whole other world.
Y'know actually , it does have a very interesting history.
This street is the first street in the city to have an underground sewer system.
Before that, sewage and waste...
...would just flow right down the street. Yeah.
Sometimes ankle-deep.
Smooth.
Excuse me?
You're gonna be starving after moving. What do you say I take you to dinner tonight?
I'd like that. Yeah? Great.
Let me take this up for you.
After you. Oh, no. After you.
Oh, my God!
Am I crazy, or does this totally go?
Oh, my God! You look so beautiful!
Thank you, Rachel. But look at Monica!
This is it. Yeah, this is the one.
I can't believe I found it.
Wow, you look so beautiful. If I knew you, I'd cry.
I'm Monica Geller. Ball like a baby.
I'm Megan Bailey.
Have you found your dress yet? Oh no, These dresses are all so amazing...
...but there is no way I couldn't afford one. No, I can't afford this either.
No. I-I-I’m, I'm just to figure out the one I want, then I'll get it at Kleinman's, this discount place in Brooklyn,
Day after tomorrow, they're having a huge sale.
Thanks for the tip. Yeah! So-so when are you getting married?
Oh I'm not. I just like to try these on. I do the same thing.
I'm just kidding. I'm getting married July 25th.
I'm just kidding too. Ha, ha.
I'm getting married in December.
So when are you getting married? Oh May 15th.
Ooh. It's getting close. Yeah! So who's your photographer?
Jeffrey. We met with him.
Did he show you the photos of the nude wedding photos? The best man? Wow!
I know. I almost called off my wedding. Heh, heh, heh.
Oh, who's your band? My  fiancee wants The Swing Kings.
Oh, you're so lucky. My fiancee wants the heavy metal band, Carcass.
Is that spelled with a "C" or a "K"? Oh, my God, it doesn't matter, they're both great!
Oh, you know what? you know what? Don't buy that here.
Now that you know what you want you should go to Kleinman's and get it half off.
This place is so over-priced.
I own this store.
So does this come in another color, or...
Hi. You moving in or moving out?
Moving in. Can I give you a hand?
Okay, but be careful. The guy who was helping before had to leave because he hurt his back.
Boyfriend? No.
I'm Joey.
Kristen.
Wow. What a beautiful name.
What is it again?
Kristen. Ah, that's it. Okay.
So uh, do you live around here? Yeah. Yeah, right down there.
Let me give you a tip.
Don't take a nap on this stoop. You could wake up without shoes gone.
I'll remember that. Okay.
Listen, would you uh, would you like to have dinner with me tonight?
I have plans tonight. Oh. But how about tomorrow?
Sounds great. Well, where does this go?
You look strong. I'll take that, you grab one of the boxes.
Okay. Yeah.
Yeah, I'll get this one.
Come on.
So this is Brooklyn?
All right, listen up. There's usually only one dress in each size.
So when they open those doors, fan out.
Now, this is what you're looking for. Memorize it.
When you locate the dress blow on these, all right?
Three sharp blasts. When you hear it, come running.
Okay, got it. All right.
Here he comes!
Oh, they're pushing! Don't be a baby!
Out of the way! Let's go!
Hey, Rachel! Come on!
No. No, not it. Not it. Not it. Ugh.
Don't crowd me.
This is it! This is the dress! Oh, my God. It's perfect.
I'm sorry, this one's taken! Whoa!
Megan! Monica!
You came! Yeah!
This is my dress! No!
Yes, it is. You saw me wearing it. And now you'll see me buying it.
What? You freak!
You wouldn't even know about this place if it wasn't for me!
Look, you don't want to fight me. Maybe I do. I'm pretty feisty!
I'm coming! I'm coming! Hey!
Okay! Hey.
Oh, what do I do?!
What are you doing? Did you find the dress?
Did you find the dress?
No. You gotta get me out of here Phoebe! These bargain shoppers are crazy.
We've gotta get Monica. No! You gotta hold my hand!
Oh, my God.
Excuse me! Excuse me!
Go! Go! Go!
Hey "Go! Now !!
So, Ross, how was your date the other night?
Did you tell her about the magical ride that starts with the flush of every toilet?
Laugh all you want, but she left me a message saying she'd like to go out again.
Oh. In fact, I'll go call her right now.
And I'll make sure and tell her my friend Chandler says...
Hey, Chandler. Hey.
Listen, sorry I didn't stop by last night, but I had a date.
Uh Joe, when it's 1:00 in the morning and you don't come by? That's okay.
Well check it out. It was with this really hot girl who just moved in right across the street.
Really? Right across the street? Yeah.
When did you meet her? Two days ago.
Excellent!
You know, Ross met somebody too. Oh, yeah?
Hey. How'd it go?
Great. We're going out again Saturday.
But I just found out she's also seeing some other guy.
Really?
Joe, what would you do if you were in Ross' situation?
Well, I sort of am. I'm dating this girl who's also seeing another guy.
But I'm not too worried about it.
Well you shouldn't be. Believe me, I wouldn't want to be the guy who's up against you.
I mean, that doofus is going to lose.
So this is nice.
I wish I didn't have to go. Believe me.
But I unfortunately have to.
Oh uh, By the way, what's the name of the girl you're dating?
Kristen Leigh. Bye.
Well, obviously, only one of us can keep dating her.
Obviously. So how do we decide?
Well now, let's look at this objectively.
I think I should date her.
Or I'm the one who dates her.
That's interesting. But check this out. I date her.
Yeah, I like that. But just to go in another direction--
Okay. okay. This can go on for a while.
Yeah well we should order some food then. No, Joey.
Look, why don't, why don't we just let her decide, okay?
We'll each go out with her one more time.
And we'll see who she likes best.
That sounds fair.
Maybe I'll take her to that new French restaurant down the street.
Ah yeah. Wait a second. Look we're gonna have to set a spending limit on the date.
I don't have the money to take her to a fancy place like that.
Well, sorry. That's what I do on dates.
All right. Well, I guess I'll just have to do what I do on dates.
So let's decide on a spending limit. Yeah.
And a slice...
Six dollars?
I was thinking more like a hundred. Okay.
Can I borrow 94 dollars?
I know. Can you hand me a tissue?
You're out of Diet Coke.
Hello?
What? You what?
You listen here, missy!
What?
That was that girl Megan. She booked The Swing Kings on the day of our wedding...
...and said that I couldn't have them back unless I gave her the dress!
Does that mean Carcass is available?
What am I gonna do? That's the dress! That is "the" dress!
Chandler wants the band. What do I do?
Well just figure out a way to talk him out of it. How?
You're out of toilet paper!
Hey. What's up?
I just wanted to come by and y'know,wish you good luck on your date.
Oh thanks. What time are you meeting her?
We have 8:00 reservations at Grand Merci Bistro.
Wow, that's in 2O minutes. You'd better get dressed.
I am dressed. Oh, well, good.
For me.
What's this? Did you give yourself a facial?
I have an oily T-zone.
Okay, dude.
Hey, you sent Kristen flowers? That's right.
You spent 100 dollars. That's the limit. You're screwed!
Actually, I sent the flowers before the actual date, so technically...
...technically, I didn't break any rules. Thanks for stopping by though.
Oh-oh! So that's the way it's gonna be? Yeah I can break the rules too. y'know!
Oh yeah? What are you gonna do? I don't know.
Why am I not surprised? Y'know what Ross? I'm not gonna let you get away with this!
I don't think you have much choice. Well we'll see!
Bye-bye. Yeah, bye-bye.
Hey! So just a light layer?
Yeah, just here and there.
Joey got meat sauce on the banister again.
Yeah, swing music is so out.
Phoebe, he's gotta be in the room for that to work.
What are you guys talking about?
Well umm, we were just talking about the y'know, the Swing Kings ...
...and just wondering whether y'know, they were the right way to go.
Yeah, I went to a wedding once where they had swing music...
...and two months later the couple got divorced.
And now I'm not saying there's any connection here y'know,...
...but they did tell me that's why they got divorced.
But I love swing music!
Yeah but The Swing Kings?
y'know they suck so much that people actually die at their concerts. They just stop living.
Look all I know is when Monica and I went to see them, we had fun.
And there's another reason too.
Well, what is the other reason? I don't want to say.
Well, you have to, because maybe it's stupid.
Well it's just while Monica and I were dancing to them...
...it was the first time I knew that...
...you were the woman that I wanted to dance all my dances with.
Oh, crap.
So they said our table will be ready in just a few minutes. Oh, great.
Is your back feeling better? Oh yeah, it's fine.
I guess, ahem, the more muscles you have...
...the more they can spasm out of control.
Kristen? Joey!
Hi. Hi.
What are you doing here? Oh I like this place.
And technically, technically, I'm not breaking any rules, so...
Well, Ross, this is Joey. Joey, Ross.
Hi. Hi. It's nice to meet you.
I used to have a friend named Joey.
I don't anymore.
Our table will be ready in a couple minutes.
Sure! I would love to wait with you guys! Thanks!
So Joey, you look familiar.
Are you on TV or something?
Well Joey doesn't like to talk about it...
...but he's one of the stars of Days of Our Lives.
That's right. That's right. Don't you play a woman?
A woman in a man's body.
Much better.
So y'know Ross it's funny, because you look familiar to me too.
Have you ever been married?
Yes, I have.
In fact, just the other day...
...Kris and I talked about how I've been married and have a son.
Yeah, little Eric. That's right. Wait. No, Ben.
So you've just been married the one time then?
Well, um... You've been married twice?
Yes. And...
...another time after that.
Boy, I'm getting hungry.
Ahem. Hey, Joey, have you ever been so hungry on a date...
...that when the girl goes to the bathroom, you eat some of her food?
You said the waiter ate my crab cake.
Yeah. So, Ross, well now—why did that first marriage break up? Hm?
Was it because the woman was straight or because she was a lesbian?
Do you two know each other? No.
No. It just seems like Ross is the kind of a guy that would marry a woman...
...on the verge of being a lesbian and then push her over the edge.
Wait a minute! Were you on a poster for gonorrhea?
Have you ever slept in the same bed with a monkey?
Hey, you leave Marcel out of this!
Fine! You ever gotten stuck in a pair of your own leather pants?
Hey, hey! Have you ever locked yourself in a TV cabinet, VD-boy?
Monkey-lover!
When do you think we lost her?
Probably around "gonorrhea."
Hi, honey, I'm home! Don't come in here!
Why, do you have another boyfriend in there?
No. We only mess around at his place.
Y'know it's funny, I started it, but now it's scaring me, so could you come out here, please?
No. I'm wearing a wedding dress.
You got a wedding dress? That's great.
Yeah, but I'm not keeping it. Well then why can't I see it?
Oh. I guess you can.
Okay but; I-I have to return it, so you can't like it.
Okay, I promise. I'll hate it.
Wow. You look hideous.
Really?
Yeah. That's like the most ugliest dress I've ever seen.
Why do you have to return it?
Oh because it doesn't really fit.
Oh, by the way, I booked The Swing Kings.
Oh, that's great. Great. Thanks.
But that dress, I mean, it's like, ugh, terrible.
It makes me want to rip it right off you. Okay.
Okay! But you can't rip it.
Well, maybe a little. Okay.
Hey, guys, you want to look at the song list for the wedding?
Guys?
I thought you'd be gone all day.
All right, what's going on?
I’m sorry. I'm sorry. I should probably leave you girls alone.
Yeah, Laugh all you want, but in 1O minutes we'll have younger-looking skin.
Yeah. Right there.
You know, she could use a little...
Oh, nice shot! Yeah! Oh! Oh! Oh!
Hey, hey! Guys, you won't believe this!
I just got off the phone with my agent. Oh, my God!
I'm sorry. Too soon. You go. Okay.
I got nominated for my part on Days of Our Lives!
Oh, Joey, good for you! Congratulations!
I can't believe you're nominated for an Emmy! No, no.
Soap Opera Digest Award? Nope, I'm up for a "Soapie."
Honey, is that something you're making up?
No, no, no, it's real! And it has been since 1998.
Hey, Rach, Rach. I'm up for a Soapie!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! That is like the third most prestigious soap opera award there is!
Thank you! Well, I guess now we know who I'm taking to the awards.
Oh, stop that! Don't kid about that! Will all the stars be there?
Many are scheduled to appear.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. I can't go. I'll be too nervous! Okay, I'll go.
No! You are getting married. This is all I have.

And Ernest Muhlbrat who first hypothesized that the velociraptor, when threatened...
...would expand its collar and emit a high-pitched noise...
...to frighten off its predator.
Yes, Mr. Lewis?
What kind of noise?
Just a high-pitched, intimidating noise.
But like how?
Well, we-we don't know for sure.
But in my head, it sounded something like this, uh:
Of course, this is just conjecture.
Ahem, okay. That's, uh, That's all for today.
Mr. Morse, can I see you for a moment?
Yes, sir?
Mr. Morse, I need to talk to you about your mid-term exam.
I'm afraid I had to fail you. Why?
Well, you need 6O percent to pass.
What'd I get? Seven.
That's not so good.
No, no, it's not. What happened there, Ned?
Well, maybe you can cut me some slack. I'm sort of in love.
Well I'm sorry, but that's really not my problem.
I'm in love with you.
Well, that brings me in the loop a little.
See, that's why I did so bad on this test. I'm having a hard time concentrating.
When you're up there and you're teaching...
...and your face gets all serious...
...you look so good. When you wear that tight little turtleneck sweater--
Okay. Ned, um--
I, uh-Ha, ha. I'm your teacher. I'm sorry.
You're-You're a student.
And I-And I like women, ha, ha.
In spite of what may be written on the backs of some of these chairs.
Oh, my God.
That guy at the counter is totally checking you out.
Really?
Oh, my God, he's really cute. Heh. Go for it.
Phoebe, I'm engaged.
I'm just saying, get his number, just in case.
But if Chandler is in an accident and can't perform sexually, you know...
...then he would want you to take a lover to satisfy the needs he can no longer fulfill.
Hi. I-Oh.
Can I just tell you something? Um--
I'm very flattered, but, uh, I'm engaged. Ha, ha.
Wow, uh-This is kind of embarrassing.
I was actually coming over to talk to your friend.
Well, you should be embarrassed.
I thought you knew I was looking at you. I did, but that was really fun.
"The winner is Joey Tribbiani!"
"Oh, wow.
I honestly never expected this. I, uh--
I didn't prepare a speech.
But I'd like to thank my parents, who've always been there for me.
Also like to thank my friends, Chandler, Monica, Phoebe, Rachel--"
I'm fourth? Jeez!
Look at you with your little maple syrup award!
Yeah may-maybe you don't tell anyone about this.
What? No.
It's not a big deal. I do that too, with my shampoo bottle.
Really? Yeah.
What award are you practicing for? Grammy.
Best New Artist. Ooh.
Oh, hey, listen. The Soapies people called today and I also get to present an award.
Aw, that's great. Yeah.
So you'll definitely get on stage even if you don't win.
You-You don't think I'm gonna win? Of course I do.
But, you know, Favorite Returning Character is a tough category, Joey.
I mean, you're up against the guy who survived his own cremation.
Yeah. No, I know I might not win. But it's just...
I've never even been nominated before. I want it so much.
Well Joey, and you'll probably get it.
But you should probably start practicing your "gracious-loser" face.
Y'know when like, the cameras are on you and you wanna look disappointed...
...but also that your colleague deserved to win. Y'know? So it's sorta like...
Hey. You know?
You practice losing at the Grammys too? Oh, no, at the Grammys, I always win.
Oh, hey. Hey. How'd your date go with Jake?
Oh, great! We couldn't keep our eyes off each other all night.
Then every once and a while y'know, he'd lean over and stroke my hair, and then touch my neck.
Okay, stop it. Phoebe, You're getting me all tingly.
All I could think of was, y'know, "Is he gonna kiss me? Is he gonna kiss me?"
And did he? I'm a lady, Monica. I don't kiss and tell.
But this hickey speaks for itself.
Okay, okay, I got it. I got it.
I just like him so much that I just feel like I've had 1O drinks today.
And I've only had six.
Oh. You know, I haven't had that feeling since I first starting going out with Chandler.
Wow, I'm never gonna have that feeling again am I? You sound like a guy.
Heh. No, a guy would be saying, "I'm never gonna get to sleep with anyone else." Heh.
Oh, my God. I'm never gonna sleep with anyone else!
I've been so busy planning the wedding, I forgot about all the things that I'd be giving up.
I mean, I'm never gonna have a first kiss again.
You'll have a last kiss.
Can I ask you something? You ever had a guy have a crush on you?
Is that why you wanted to tie my tie?
There's this kid in my class who said he's in love with me.
Whoa! Yeah.
Whoa, what? Ross has a boyfriend.
I do-I do not have a boyfriend.
There's a guy in one of my classes who has a crush on me.
Really? Yeah. I don't know.
I mean, last year, Elizabeth, now this kid...
What-What-What is it? Am I giving out some kind of...
...a sexy-professor vibe?
Not right now.
It-it—The point is, my natural charisma has made him fail his midterm.
Aw, see now I feel bad for the kid.
I had a crush on a teacher once, and it was so hard, you know.
I couldn't concentrate and I blushed every time he looked at me.
Come on, you remember what it's like to be 19 and in love.
Yeah, guess I can cut him some slack. Yeah.
How'd you get over that teacher? I didn't.
I got under him.
Problem solved.
Bye,Phoebe. Okay, bye.
All right. Bye. Bye.
We said goodbye at the door so as not to flaunt our new love.
Phoebe, it's okay. You don't have to tip toe around me.
I've been thinking about it, and um-You know what?
I'm okay about not having that new-relationship feeling.
I miss you already! I miss you too!
See, that's what I mean. I mean that, That's great, but I wouldn't trade in what I have for that.
I mean, I'm gonna be with Chandler for the rest of my life.
That's what makes me happy. Mm-hm.
Hey, sweetie, come here, Come sit down. Hey Phoebe and I were just talking about how our relationship is...
...deep and meaningful. It really is, don't you think?
Oh, totally.
Pull my finger.
Presenting the award for Favorite Returning Male Character is McKensize...
This is it. This is my category!
Got your speech? Got my speech.
Got your gracious-loser face? Yep.

...who always believed in me.
And she'd also like to thank my friends:
Chandler, Monica, Ross, Phoebe and Rachel...
...who's sitting right there.
Joey, why did we have to rush out of there so fast?
We had to get out of there because--
Look what I won! Ha-ha-ha.
Oh, my God. You stole her award.
No, no, no. I'm accepting it on her behalf.
Joey I don't think you know what "behalf" means.
Sure I do. It's a verb. As in "I be half-in' it"!
Joey"
You have got to take this back. But why?! I should've won one. I really wanted it.
She didn't even care enough to come to the thing. It could also be a Grammy.
No, Joey.
Come on, Rach. No one saw me take it. There was a whole table full of them.
Do you really want an award that you didn't win?
No, I want an award I did win. But nobody's given me any of those!
Plus, look, hey, Rach. lf l put it up there right? when people come over, they'll see it...
...and they'll think I won it.
Joey, it says "Best Supporting Actress."
I can scratch that right off.
Joey, no, this is wrong. You have to take it back.
Okay? You don't wanna win an award this way. You're very talented.
And someday you're gonna win one of these for real and that one is gonna mean something.
Oh, all right. All right? Thank you.
I'll take it back tomorrow. Thank you.
If I can't have it, you can't have it! Aah!
Professor Geller? Yes, Mr. Lewis? How can I help you?
I know I didn't do well on my midterms and stuff...
...but I was kind of hoping you could change my grade.
And why exactly would I do that?
Because I'm in love with you.
What?
Yeah. I'm all in love with you and stuff.
So could you change my grade? No!
Well, why not? You changed Ned's grade.
Well, that's different, okay? Because he was actually in love with me.
No, he's not! He's totally yanking your chain.
He's done this with three other teachers.
What? He's got a girlfriend.
I can't believe someone would do that for a grade.
I know.
It's awful.
I love you.
Have you seen Chandler? No, why?
'Cause I just keep thinking about all these things I'm not gonna have...
...and it's freaking me out. I don't know what to do about it.
Okay. Don't sweat it.
Chandler is nowhere around, so go ahead get it out of your system. That guy's cute.
Phoebe, come on, I'm serious.
I've just gotta talk to him about all this. No that is the last thing you wanna do.
Why? Because you're marrying him!
You gotta help me out here, Pheebs.
All right, I've never been engaged and I've never really been married.
But I can only tell you what my mother told me.
Whenever you have doubts or fears or anxieties about a relationship...
...do not communicate them to your husband.
So I'm not supposed to share my doubts and fears...
...with the guy I'm spending the rest of my life with?
That is correct. Yes.
You're supposed to take all of that stuff and put it in a little box in your mind...
...and then lock it up tight.
Your mother told you this? Yes.
The woman that got married a bunch of times and killed herself when you were 13?
Oh, my God, you're right.
Go! Go tell Chandler. Hurry, before it's too late!
Wait, no! Does this also mean that putting out doesn't get you love?
I can't believe I'm gonna meet Jessica Ashley! Wait, wait.
Please be cool, okay? I work with this woman.
Okay, I'm totally cool. Okay.
Come in.
Hey, Jessica.
Hey, Jess.
Ah, this is my friend Rachel.
Hi. What's up?
Uh, listen, here's your Soapie. I accepted it for you.
Oh, my God. I won? Do you have any idea what this means?
Well, that-that-that's it? You're gonna, you're not gonna put it on your shelf or anything?
No, I try to save that for real awards. Now if you'll excuse me?
Take it back? Absolutely.
Yeah, you do.
Honey? As we get closer to the wedding... Hm?
...Is there anything you'd like to talk about or share?
Okay. Well, I think the centerpieces are too big.
You're wrong. The centerpieces are fine.
Do you ever get scared at all? Kind of. They're really big.
Doesn't it ever freak you out that you're never gonna be with anybody new again?
What?
Just--
I love you so much. Just--
It's just sometimes it bothers me that I'm never gonna have that feeling.
When you first meet someone for the first time...
...and it's new and exciting. You know that rush?
No.
No, see, when I first meet somebody...
...it's mostly panic, anxiety and a great deal of sweating.
Okay, but-All right, you're a guy.
Does it not freak you out that you're never gonna sleep with anybody else?
Sleeping with somebody, no.
Anxiety, panic and I'm afraid even more sweating.
Even with me?
I was dangerously dehydrated during the first six months of our relationship.
Look, for me the rush is knowing that we are gonna be together for the rest of our lives.
Really? Well, yeah.
But now that I know that you're having these thoughts, we're back to panic, anxiety and, uh...
...I'm definitely gonna need some kind of sports drink.
Come here.
Come here. Oh, sweetie, you don't have to worry.
No. Besides, you know what? I'm gonna have a lot of new things with you.
The first time we buy a house, our first kid, our first grandkid.
Water. Water. Water.
Uh, Mr. Morse? Can I speak to you for a moment?
That was a great lecture today.
Did you get a haircut? Mm-hm.
Yeah, yeah. Do you like it? Do you love it?
I want you to know that I'm changing your grade back.
What? Why?
Because I know what you're trying to pull here. It's not gonna work.
I'm not trying to pull anything. Look, I love you, dude.
You know what, I'm not even gonna talk about this. This little "thing" is over.
I know you have a girlfriend. Yeah. And I know about the other professors.
How do you think that makes me feel, Ned? You used me!
You don't love me and you never did!
Ah, Professor Winston. Professor Frederickson.
I'll be right with you.
Don't make this worse and I'll give you a C. Shall we?
Rash'?
I'll be out in a second. Hm.
"It's just so unexpected! I--
I'll tell you, it's just such an honor to just be nominated...
...for a Nobel Prize.
And, you know, to win one for a massage! Oh...
Especially after having just won a Tony Award for Best Actress--"
Honey, we have to go. Our reservations are at 8.
"--In Reservations at Eight by Neil Simon.
Thank you, Neil. Thank you for the words."
Okay honey, You can finish this later. We're gonna be late. We gotta go.
Please don't play the music. Just one more thing.
0Kay
"Live from New York, it's Saturday Night!"
Oh, hey! How was your audition?
I'm sorry, do I know you?
What are you doing?
Nothing, I'm just Practicing blowing you off. because I'm gonna be a big movie star!
Oh, you got it?
Well, no not yet, but the audition went really good. What's it for?
Oh, it's this big-budget period movie about three Italian brothers...
...who come to America around the turn of the century. It's really classy.
Oh, and the director is supposed to be the next-next Martin Scorsese.
The "next-next"?
Yeah, there's this guy from Chicago who's supposed to be the next Martin Scorsese, all right?
But then this guy's right after him.
Hello?
Joey, it's Estelle. I just talked to the casting people. They loved you!
They loved me!
Yeah, they want to see you again tomorrow.
Oh, my God. There's just one thing.
Do you have a problem with full-frontal nudity?
Are you kidding me? I never rent a movie without it!
Oh.
Uh, okay, let me call you back.
What's the matter? They want me to be totally naked in the movie!
Wow. I know.
My grandmother's gonna see this. Grandma's gonna have to get in line.
Friends  S07E19  The One With Ross and Monica's Cousin
Hey the Wedding's so close. Are you getting nervous?
Yeah, but a part of me also can't wait 'til it's over.
Chandler and I have this pact not to have sex again until the wedding.
A "no sex" pact, huh?
I actually have one of those going on with every woman in America.
Hey Phoebe, will you give me a hand I gotta making up the guest bedroom?
Hey, Cousin Cassie is coming to stay with us a few days.
Cassie? Wow, I haven't seen her for like forever.
I wonder if she still carries that a Barbie everywhere she goes.
Ross, she's 25 years old. So what! I still have--
No you're probably right.
Hi. Hey.
Pheebs, can I talk to you over here for a second?
Yeah.
Subtle, guys.
What?
I know you're planning my surprise bridal shower.
Ha, Well okay, Well don't ruin it! Just play along, at least.
Okay. Sorry. Okay.
Oh, my God. We have to throw her a shower?
Hey! What'd you decide to do about the movie?
I don't know.
It's not like it's porn. This is a serious, legitimate movie. Y'know?
And the udity's really important to the story.
That's what you say about porn.
You're right. Maybe I shouldn't even go on the callback.
No, No you should. A lot of major actors do nude scenes.
I mean the chance to star in a movie? Come on!
Well that's true. And I'm only naked in one scene. Plus it sounds really great.
My character's Catholic. He falls in love with a Jewish girl.
Who run away together and they get caught in this big rainstorm.
So we go into this barn, undress each other and hold each other.
It's really sweet and tender.
Plus, everyone is gonna see your thing.
Well when can we have this shower?
She has so much going on, we have only two options.
We have Friday. Well that's only two days away.
What is the other option? Yesterday.
Well, if we make it yesterday, woo-hoo, we're done.
Oh my God Phoebe, this is impossible! We can't do this by Friday.
We have to find a place, We have to invite people! get food.
There's just too much to do. It's impossible! We cannot do it!
We cannot do it! Rachel, Calm down!
Okay. I'm sorry, you're right. you're right. I'm sorry.
Just calm down, woman!
Phoebe, I already. I already did.
Oh okay. All right, then I need to calm down a little.
Okay. Okay. I think we can do this if we just get organized. All right?
Uh-huh. We have two days to plan this party.
We just need to make fast decisions. Mm-hm.
Okay? All right, where will we have it?
Um, here. What time? Four o'clock. Food?
Finger sandwiches and tea. Ooh, great. Very Monica.
And chili. Ah, you went one too far.
Uh, flowers or balloons? Both.
We're paying for this. Neither.
Um, what should we do for the theme? "Lusts of the Flesh."
What? I don't know. Cowboy theme?
Hey. Hey.
I'm really glad we decided not to sleep together before the wedding.
Oh, boy. Me too.
You know, I was thinking, if we had a big fight--
Mm-hm. ...and, uh, we broke up for a few hours.
Yeah. Technically, we could have sex again.
What do you think, bossy and domineering?
The Wedding's off, sloppy and immature.
That's me. Come on. Okay.
Okay. But wait. we can't. My Cousin Cassie is in the guest room. We're supposed to have lunch.
Well get rid of her, obsessive and shrill.
Shrill? The wedding is back on.
I thought I heard voices. You must be Chandler.
Hi. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you too.
So, are you ready to go? Yeah.
Chandler? I'll be right with you.
Cassie needs to stay at your place. What-Why?
Because "Pervie Perverson" over here can't stop staring at her.
What?! Chandler, she's our cousin!
I wasn't staring at her. Okay? I was just listening intently.
It's called being a good conversationalist. Watch.
Say something.
You were staring about eight inches south of there.
Fine. She can stay at my place.
By the way, what-what does Cassie even look like now?
She looks exactly like Aunt Marilyn. Huh.
So this Aunt Marilyn, is she coming to the wedding?
Wafer-thin ice.
Hey, I'm back.
Hi, Joey.
Uh, so, will I be reading the same scene again?
Actually, I tried to call you. You didn't need to come today.
Oh, great.
Y'know I'd have been perfect for this part. but whatever!
Y'know, thanks for making a bad decision and ruined your movie. Good day!
Wait Joey! You didn't need to come down because the director saw your tape from yesterday and loved it.
And scene.
Huh? Wasn't that fun?
We did a little improv there. Yeah!
So, you-You were saying?
Well, the director thinks you're really right for the part and wants to meet you tomorrow.
Wow. Sure. That's great.
Oh and your agent said you're okay with the nudity.
Yeah! Yeah, sure. just long as it's handled tastefully.
And that barn is not too cold.
Terrific. Well, uh, there's one more thing.
Uh... Uh, it's really important to the director that everything in this movie is authentic.
Yeah and so in your love scene with Sarah...
...she talks about how she's never seen a naked man who wasn't Jewish.
So...
So, what?
So, uh, well, the director is insisting that whoever play that part...
...be authentically, uh, anatomically...
...not Jewish. You know what I'm saying?
Yes!
No. What?
An Italian Catholic immigrant at this time would not be...
Bar mitzvah-ed?
So to get this part you can't be-Nope.
But you are? Yep.
But you told them you weren't? That's right.
Wow. Wow.
And it's definitely all gone? There's nothing there to work with?
What were you thinking? I don't know. I really want this part.
And they tell you no matter what you get asked at an audition you say yes.
Like if-if they want you to ride a horse, you tell 'em you can
And just figure out how to do it later.
Joey! This is not like learning to ride a horse. This is like learning to...
...grow a turtleneck.
I know, I know! okay? And apparently tomorrow, when I go in to meet the director...
...I have to take off my clothes so  that they can see what my body looks like.
Oh, my God. What are you gonna do?
I just have to call my agent and tell her I can't do the part.
Unless...
Unless what?
Well, this may sound crazy, but there may be something we could...
...fashion.
Like what? Well, I'm not sure yet, but, um...
...off the top of my head, I'm thinking...
...double-sided tape and some sort of luncheon meat.
Hey! I've got a great idea for party favors for the shower. Okay,
we get some uh mahogany boxes and carve everyone's names in them.
and inside is everyone's individual birth stone.
Okay. Okay.
All right, you take care of that. Okay.
And meanwhile, the party's tomorrow and we still don't have a guest list.
Okay. Okay! Well okay, Who do we know that's coming? Me. Are you?
Hey. Hey, what's up Mon?
Well uh, I'm trying to making something for Joey. Do you mind if I raid your fridge?
Have at it.
Okay. All right. Turkey? Mm, that won't work.
Cheese? That won't work.
Olive loaf? I hope that won't work.
Are you making him a sandwich?
No, it's, um, more like a wrap.
Okay, so, um, I'm gonna go, guys.
I guess you can get back to deciding on what to get me for a present!
We have to get her a present?
Okay, but look. Look at what I got.
It's her address book. We have a guest list.
Oh my God you're amazing. Did you pull that out of her purse?
Uh-huh. And a little seed money for the party.
Cassie?
Hey, Ross. Hi. ha, ha.
It's been so long!
Last time I saw you...
...you were setting up your tent in line to see Return of the Jedi.
Oh, Oh, uh, that's right.
So-so you did see me that day. Because it seemed like you didn't.
Yeah, sorry about that. It's okay. Come, come on in.
Thanks for letting me stay here. I mean Monica's place was nice.
But her fiancee sure stares a lot.
Oh, my God! You do a great Chandler!
Uh-huh. Yeah, I have a knack for impressions.
Well, maybe after we get re-acquainted, uh, you could do me.
Yeah. No!
Cassie, how you--? How you doing on that...
hot dog.
I'm all done. Thank God.
I guess the last time we really hung out was when our parents rented that beach house together.
Oh, right, right. Ooh, remember the time...
...l, uh, pinned you down and tickled you until you cried?
We're probably too old to do that now.
I'll always remember that summer. because it's when I got all of these freckles.
Uh-huh! Uh-huh! And-And I'll always remember that summer...
...because that's when I realized that we are related.
It took you that long to figure it out, huh?
Well I'm, I'm a little slow.
Just as our children would be.
Hi. Hi.
How are you? Good. Hi. Thanks for coming.
Oh, thank you. Thank you. No? All right. Oh, it's so nice to see you.
No, thanks. Okay. Hey, Rash?
Yeah? Who the hell are all these people?
I don't know. I called all the people in Monica's phone book
and these are the only ones who could show up on 24 hours notice.
Hmm, y'know there's another word for people like that: Losers.
Hi, I'm Rachel. This is Phoebe. I'm the maid of honor.
How do you know Monica?
I was her accountant four years ago. Oh...
I'm very interested to find out who's been doing her taxes the last four years.
That's great.
So, what time is Monica supposed to get here? I don't know.
Excuse us for a minute.
You didn't tell her to come?! You were supposed to tell her!
No I wasn't! You were supposed to tell her to come! I was supposed to bringing the cake!
Fine, I'll go call her. Yes! And please tell her to bring a cake!
Okay, we have a lot of options here, A number of prototypes for you to try on.
Wow, those look great.
Yeah! Okay, this one's a mushroom cap. Uh, this one is made of bologna.
And-And the toothpicks? Oh, just until the glue dries.
Thank God.
Now, these are-are more realistic, but perishable.
Okay? Over here, we have pink suede, which is nice.
But umm, if it gets wet, then you know it'll shrink.
Well maybe we'll just take that one away.
I also did a little something in fur, but, uh, that's really just for me.
Okay. So, why don't you go into your room and try these on? We'll get a better idea of what's gonna work.
Thanks, you are such a good friend. And this is so weird.
Toothpick? Yeah.
What are you trying now? The Fruit Roll-up.
And? Delicious.
Joey.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. We have a winner!
What? Which one?
The Silly Putty. It's not so silly anymore!
She's your cousin. She's your cousin.
If she knew what was going on in your head, she'd think you were sick.
Or would she? Let's back up for a second.
She was the one who suggested opening a bottle of wine.
She was the one who turned down the lights.
She was the one that wanted to rent Logan's Run...
...the sexiest movie ever.
Oh, I know that look.
Forget it. I want it. She wants it.
I'm going in.
Hey! What the hell are you doing?
Say something clever.
Okay, doesn't have to be clever.
it just has to be words. Say some words.
Any words will do.
Oh, my God, this is the longest...
...that anyone has not talked ever!
There is nothing you can say to make this worse...
...so just say something!
I haven't had sex in a very long time.
Yeah, you really shouldn't have said anything.
Phoebe? Rachel? It's Monica.
I wonder what you could possibly need me for on such short notice?
Oh.
Oh, Monica. We are so sorry. For what?
Well first, for forgetting to throw you a bridal shower.
And then for forgetting to invite you to it.
You already had it?
Yeah. Well, we called everyone in your phone book. A bunch of people came.
but it took us so long to get you here that they had to leave.
Yeah, we wanted to throw you a big surprise and a great shower.
and now you don't have either.
We ruined everything. Ugh.
Well no, wait a minute, that's not true. No, what did, that was really sweet.
And it kind of works out for the best, heh. What do you mean?
Well now, I get to spend my shower with the only people I really love.
I mean, I get all those presents without talking to people I don't even like!
Surprise. Surprise, Monica.
And what's cool is, the character is from Naples, right?
Yeah. My whole family's from Naples.
Oh that's great. Okay. well I've heard everything I need to hear...
We just need to, uh...
Leslie?
Uh, Joey, this is the awkward part. Oh, hey, right. Not a problem.
I totally understand you need to...
...y'know make sure I don't have any horrible scars or tattoos.
Don't you worry.
I have nothing to hide.
So, there you go. That's me.
One hundred-percent natural.
I tell you, that has never happened before.
Cassie, are you finding everything okay in there?
Yeah. Thank you so much for letting me stay here.
Oh, it's no problem. I've...
What?
Say something. Say anything.
Ask her out! She's not your cousin!
Hey, out of all of us, who do you think will get married next?
Probably Monica and Chandler.
Hi, could I have a pack of Newport Lights? please?
Oh, urn, uh, we don't sell cigarettes, but they have them at the newsstand across the street.
That'd be great. Thanks.
Oh, my God.
Melissa Worbert. I don't think I have the energy for this.
Oh, my God! Ray-Ray Green?
Melissa. Hey.
You've been M.I.A for the past seven sorority newsletters.
What's up with you?
Why don't I tell you over here?
So last I heard you were gonna get married.
Poor Ray-Ray.
Oh, no, no. it's-It's good. It's all good.
I actually work at Ralph Lauren. Shut up!
I will not. Heh, heh. I'm the divisional head of men's sportswear.
Oh, shut up more! Now, are you friends with Ralph?
Oh, please. Ha. Are you?
No.
Listen, we have to have dinner. What are you doing tomorrow night?
Oh, tomorrow. I don't know. Um--You do now. You're having dinner with me.
Shut up.
I've gotta go. This has been so great, Ray-Ray.
Oh, there you are.
Um, so listen, just call me. Here's my card.
Oh, wow, thanks.
Oh, you're in real estate? Oh, no, heh, that's an old card.
Um, I wanted to get out of that and-and do something where I can really...
...help people and make a difference.
Wow. What do you do now?
I'm a party planner.
I'll see you tomorrow. Okay.
Hey guys, look who's back. It's Ray-Ray.
Shut up that was my friend, Melissa, from college.
She seems really, really fun!
She's actually very sweet, and we used to be very close.
Wait a minute. she isn't...She's not the one who you...?
Who you what? Who you what?
Yes. Wow!
Wow-Wow, what? Wow what?! Who you what?
Oh, it's not a big deal.
They were lovers.
What? What?
No, we weren't. It was nothing.
It was one night, senior year, and we went to a party...
...had a lot of sangria, and you know, ended up...
...kissing for a bit.
So that's two of my wives.
Friends  S07E20  The One With Rachel's Big Kiss
Okay, so this is where the band is. And this is where the bar is.
And all these pins have people's names on them. And Rach, here you are.
Oh, wow!
Why don't we just take me and put me with a Manhattan in my hand...
...talking to the cute bartender.
These pins aren't for playing, are they?
Okay, the red ones are my guests, and the blue ones are yours.
This is so sad. I mean, I only have like 10 pins.
Heh, Chandler, relax. It's not a contest.
Certainly not a close one.
Hello. Hey.
Hey, Rash.
Stop picturing it!
Okay, I think that's it. The seating chart is done. This is our wedding.
Wow. They all look like they're having fun  don't they?
Hey, so where are my parents gonna be?
Let's see, well, if this is the wedding hall, then, um...
...your parents would be over here at home in Queens.
What they're not invited? Oh, no, that's terrible! they're gonna be crushed!
Why would they think they're invited?
You got me. I don't...
Joey! Well, I'm sorry. Look, I thought parents were coming.
Y'know? Your parents are coming. Chandler's parents are coming.
Ross's parents are coming.
Ross's parents are my parents.
Well-well, see, parents are coming.
Y'know I think we should invite them. Oh please, you just want more blue pins.
Well, this is just sad.
All right. all right. Maybe I can fit them in if I just do some rearranging.
But uh, Rachel may actually have to sit at the bar.
That is not a problem.
Maybe you'll order a little sangria. Oh, get out of here!
So now, these are all the tuxedos that we make and if there's anything that you like, we can make you a deal.
Anything at all. But these are the three that Monica pre-approved.
Uh, well, thanks a lot for hooking me up Rach.
And I want you to know that I want you to attend our wedding as my guest.
I'm Monica's maid of honor.
Okay, don't try to blue-pin me.
Well, what's the deal with these? These-these look nice. Oh they are nice.
We-we custom-make tuxedos for celebrities and then when they're done with them they just send 'em back.
You mean, like, for award shows? Some of them.
You mean these tuxes have been down the red carpet with people yelling, uh...
..."Who are you wearing? You look fabulous!"
Honey, might I suggest watching a little more ESPN...
...and a little less E!.
Okay. Who wore those?
Umm, well, let's see uh, this one's Tom Brokaw. Not bad.
This one is, uh, Paul O'Neil.
Who's that?
He plays for the Yankees. Seriously, ESPN.
Just once in a while. Have it on in the background.
Ooh, this one was Pierce Brosnan.
Pierce Brosnan? Uh-huh.
Are you serious? Yeah.
O07?
This is James Bond's tux? Oh, I have to get married in James Bond's tux.
Ha, ha. It's a pretty cool tux.
Ah, Oh, it's not just that. I would be England's most powerful weapon.
A jet-setting heartbreaker on Her Majesty's secret service.
A man who fears no one, with a license to kill.
Would Monica let me wear this?
We should really learn how to play the real way.
I like our way.
Chess!
Nice move. Yeah.
Hey. Hey.
So Joey I just hooked Ross and Chandler up with some tuxedos for the wedding, Do you need one?
No, I'm performing the ceremony. I'm not wearing a tux.
Well, what are you gonna wear? Multi-colored robes.
Ooh, and maybe a hat.
Huh. Does Monica know about this? I don't think so.
Can I please be there when you tell her?
Hey, Rach wait! you want to go to a movie tonight?
Oh, y'know what? I can't. I have to have dinner with that Melissa girl.
Can I come?
I won't even talk! You'll just hear the noise from my video camera.
What? What's going on? Oh good! Can I tell her? Can I tell her?!
Do you want to hear what actually happened or Joey's lewd version?
Joey's. Okay.
Okay, come on.
I had this friend from college...
...and I made the mistake of telling Joey that one time...
...she and I, you know, kissed a little bit.
Yeah, I'm sure that happened.
It did. Sure.
Hey, heh. It happened.
Yeah, it was senior year in college. It was after the Sigma Chi luau...
...and Melissa and I got very drunk.
And we ended up kissing. For several minutes.
Which means she had a couple spritzers and a peck on the cheek.
Why are you taking this away from me? Ugh.
Yeah, why is it so hard for you to believe?
Okay. I just I didn't know that you were a lesbian.
I'm not saying that I'm a lesbian. I'm just saying that this happened.
Okay, it just seems pretty wild. And you're-You know, so...
...vanilla.
Vanilla? I'm not vanilla. I've done lots of crazy things.
I mean, I got drunk and married in Vegas.
To Ross.
All right, y'know what? If you don't want to believe me  about this...
...why don't you just come with me to dinner tonight and she'll tell you.
Okay. All right! Yeah! Because I can't picture it.
Oh-ho, you should get inside my head.
Hey. Hey.
Guess what I got for your wedding?
A freakishly thin date with a hanger for a head?
No. Rachel hooked me up with a tux. But not just any tux.
Batman's tux!
What? That's right.
Made expressly for Val Kilmer, and worn by him in the hit film...
...that Batman film he was in.
You can't wear that. I'm wearing the famous tux.
James Bond's tux. So?
So—If you wear that, you'll make mine less special.
Well, you need something to to make this day special?
Hello! You have the most special thing of all.
You are marrying the woman you love.
Please, don't take away my cool thing. Please?! Pretty please?
"Pretty please?" Not very, uh, 007.
Look, it's my wedding day okay? If you were getting married, I'd never do anything to upset you.
When I got married you slept with my sister. That was pretty 007.
Hey. Hey. Okay, good. You're here.
All right, I figured it out.
I'm gonna take 2 tables of 8, I'm gonna add your parents...
...and I'm gonna turn them into 3 tables of 6. Okay?
And I called the caterer. I added two extra meals, We are good to go!
Yeah. They're not coming.
What?
Somehow they got the idea that you only invited them because of me.
They...feel a little unwanted.
Oh that's too bad. It's true. But too bad.
Look Mon, if you could just call my mom. Oh, Joey.
Come on. Look just-just tell—let her know that you really want them there.
Let's not forget this is a woman who that has sent you many lasagnas over the years.
No, she hasn't.
Is it her fault that some of them didn't make it to you?
Well, what am I gonna say?
Just uh, Just tell them you mixed up invitations. No, no, no, blame it on the post office.
They hate the post office. And the Irish.
But I don't think you could blame it on them.
Hello? Yeah, hi. Uh, Mrs. Tribbiani? Hi, this is Monica Geller.
I'm just calling to say that Chandler and I uh, really hope you can make the wedding.
Yeah, apparently a bunch of invitations that we sent weren't delivered.
Um, I guess there was some screw-up at the damn post office.
Tell me about it.
Yeah, yeah, the U.S. Post Office? No. More like U.S. Lost Office.
What are they, Irish?
Anyway, his name's Allen. And we've been going out for three years.
He was my first client when I became a party planner.
He was actually planning a party for his girlfriend at the time.
Oh, well. No.
Ah. He was Theta Beta Pi at Syracuse. Oh! Oh, that's great.
Phoebe, were you ever in a sorority? Of course.
Yes. I was a, um, Thigh Mega Tampon.
What one?
Yeah, Y'know, we were really huge too. But then they had to shut us down...
...when Regina Phalangie died of alcohol poisoning.
Oh, isn't it a shame when one girl ruins it for the whole bunch?
Anyway...
Speaking of drinking too much, I was, uh, telling Phoebe...
...about that one crazy night after the Sigma Chi luau where you and I uh, we made out.
What?
Remember we-Come on, we had sarongs on and we had coconut bikini tops.
We went back to the house and got really silly...
...and we made out.
Wow, Ray-Ray, I have no idea what you're talking about.
Really?
Ross is Batman.
Well, he did manage to keep his identity secret for a long time.
Rachel got Ross the tuxedo that Val Kilmer wore in Batman.
Batman is so much cooler than James Bond.
What are you talking about?!  007 has all those gadgets. Batman has a utility belt.
007 has a fancy car. Batman has the Batmobile.
007 gets all the ladies. Heh. Batman has Robin.
We get ESPN, right?
How about you go put on your 007 tuxedo, and I'll make you a nice martini?
Actually I don't like martinis.
A Yoo-Hoo with a funny straw? Ooh, yum.
Hey. Hey.
Listen, I know the invitation says 6:00...
...but does that mean that you want people to get there at 6, or the show is gonna start right at 6?
The show?
Right, Right. the wedding. Gotcha.
But I mean, it's gonna start a little late right? I mean, weddings start late. Right?
Have you ever been to one of my weddings?
Ah, Well look, the thing is it's the same day as my niece's christening...
...and I really want my parents to be there in time to see me.
'Cause My part's just in the beginning. I'm not even in the rest of the show-Wedding.
The wedding starts at 6.
Okay. Okay, I totally hear you.
Ooh! How about this? I vamp a little till they get there.
Heh. You'll "vamp"?
Yeah, yeah, y'know, like warm up the crowd. Ask 'em where they're from.
'Cause In Joey Tribbiani, you get a minister and you get an entertainer.
I'm a "mini-stainer."
There's no one better. There's no one greater.
How can you not remember us kissing?
I don't know. I don't remember a lot of things that never happened.
Wha--
Come on! Remember, we were on the sleeping porch? We couldn't stop giggling.
And our coconuts kept knocking together.
Oh, somewhere Joey's head is exploding.
Yeah—but come on—Listen, I'm sorry I don't want to make you uncomfortable...
...but I told Phoebe it happened, and she doesn't believe me.
I'm sorry. Ray-ray. I mean, if I thought it happened, I would say it.
Maybe I passed out and you did stuff to me while I was sleeping.
No.
Rachel, It's okay, you don't have to do this. I believe you.
Okay, if-if you say you kissed Melissa, then you kissed Melissa.
Thank you, Phoebe. Okay.
But she didn't. I know.
Hey. Hey.
You just carry that around?
Yes.
I find it to be something of a conversation piece.
Between you and...? Gunther.
Hey, hey. Why don't we put them on?
Y'know get a picture of Batman and James Bond, together.
I would but mine doesn't fit. The pants a little tight.
A little tight? I could see double-oh and seven in those pants.
Well that stinks. I was looking forward to us wearing our celebrity tuxes together.
Well, does that mean that you're not gonna be wearing yours? What are you kidding? It's Batman's tux!
Let me try it on.
Okay. But just the jacket. double-oh and seven are not getting in there.
0Kay.
Holy double-vented comfort, Batman!
What's this? Huh?
An invitation to the At First Sight premiere?
Oh, my God.
Val Kilmer didn't wear this in Batman.
He wore it to the premiere of some tooty-fruity lovestory where he was a blind guy.
Let me see that.
Oh, man.
The only super power you have is the slightly heightened sense of smell.
Hey. Uh, Monica? Chandler? can I talk to you guys for a second?
All right that's it, I give up. Whatever you want, you can have it.
You want to sing a song? You wanna do a dance?
You want your mom stand at the altar screaming racial slurs? I don't care.
No! No, I-I just want to thank you guys for what you did for my parents. that was really sweet.
They're so happy to get to be a part of your special day.
Well, your welcome. And tell them we're really glad they're coming.
Okay. I will. Oh, check out what they got me to wear for the ceremony!
Huh? I wear it like this when I marry you guys. And then this...
...is for party time.
It happened. I am telling you it happened. Okay.
Hey, Well, it was great meeting you.
And, uh, Rachel? I don't think I'll be calling you because, uh...
...you know, you've gotten weird.
Take care, you guys.
Wha-Wait a minute. No wait a minute! Okay, look.
That night was the one wild thing I've ever done in my entire life.
and I'm not gonna let you take that away from me.
Okay, so if you don't remember that, maybe you'll remember this...
Oh, my God. You love me.
What? Of course I remember our kiss.
I think about it all the time.
I can still hear the coconuts knocking together, I...
I just didn't want to tell you, because I didn't think that you'd return my love. and now that you have...
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Aw! Look who's being suddenly shy.
You can't tell me you don't feel what I feel.
Nobody can kiss that good and not mean it.
I-I-I-I'm just…I'm just a good kisser!
Shut up.
I'm sorry.
Oh, you don't have to be sorry.
I'm obviously kidding.
I'm not in love with you. I'm not in love with her.
I don't hear coconuts banging together.
Yeah, I don't picture your face when I make love to my boyfriend.
Anyway, I gotta go.
A kiss goodbye?
No? Okay.
I mean, I had no idea that that was gonna...
What the hell was that?
I just wanted to see what all the fuss was about.
And? I've had better.
All right! I found one that fits.
Well, you know what they say? 23rd time's a charm.
Aw! Look at you, all handsome.
Whose is it? Oh, does it matter?
All that matters is that you look so handsome.
Whose is it? I don't want to say.
Oh, come on, I don't care. Come on! Whose is it?
Diane Keaton.
Do you realize that four weeks from today we're getting married?
Four weeks, baby. Four weeks!
You realize you get louder each week?
There's still so much to do! Have you written your vows yet?
I figured I'd just buy those. "Pat, I'd like to buy a vow." Ha, ha.
Sweetie, you know I've no sense of humor when it comes to the wedding.
Right. So uh, have you written yours yet? No, but I know exactly what I'm gonna say.
Do you happen to know what I'm gonna say?
Let's just do it right now. Okay? It won't be hard.
Just say what's in your heart.
Look at her go. She must love me more than I love her!
What's wrong with me? Ooh, don't open that door.
Friends  S07E021  The One With The Vows
Phew. "Monica, there are no words--"
There are no words! This shouldn't be this hard!
All right, uh...Uh-Oh! You've done this before. What did you say in your vows?
Well with Carol, I promised never to love another woman until the day I die.
She made no such promise.
I'm so pathetic! Monica knows what she wants to say! you should have seen her. Writing, writing, writing!
Monica what? What?! What's the emergency?
You have to help me I'm supposed to be writing my vows and all I have is this.
Well, I like the pretty little drawing of you in the wedding dress.
Thank you. Yeah, except your breasts look small.
Those are my eyes!
Those are my breasts. Oh, yeah.
Well, why don't you just start with something simple?
Like, urn:
"Monica, from the moment I met you I knew I loved you."
Yeah, I' m not sure I can't do that.
Everyone, this is Chandler.
Hi, I'm Ross' little sister.
0Kay.
Okay, okay. Um, maybe you could start with:
"Chandler, even though we were friends...
...there was a part of me that always knew I wanted more."
All right, there's a nuclear holocaust. I'm the last man on Earth.
Would you go outwith me?
Ooh! Are we allowed to lie in the vows?
Well maybe you don't talk about those feelings back then. Maybe you just say something about y'know ...
...all the things he's taught you, like--
Or all the things you taught him.
Everybody knows the basic erogenous zones. One, two, three...
...four, five, six and seven.
There are seven?
That's one? Heh, heh. It's kind of an important one.
Oh, y'know-y'know what,I was looking at it upside down.
Ha. You know, sometimes that helps.
Okay, start out with a little one...
...a two, a one-two-three...
...a three, a five...
...a four, a three-two...
...two, a two-four-six.
Two-four-six, four, two...
...two, four-seven...
...five-seven, six-seven...
. . seven, seven...
. . seven, seven, seven...
"seven!
Seven.
Oh! I got it. How about saying something like:
"Monica, when I look back over our time together..."
Yeah? I can't do all of it.
Look back over your time together.
Oh, look, twins!
No fair! I don't even have one, how come they get two?
You'll get one. Yeah, when?
All right, I'll tell you what.
When we're 40, if neither of us are married...
...what do you say you and I get together and have one? Why wouldn't I be married when I'm 40?
Oh, no, no, no. I just meant hypothetically.
Ok, Hypothetically, why won't I be married when I'm 40?
No, no. no.
What is it? ls there something fundamentally unmarriable about me?
Uh-Uh--Well?
Dear God, this parachute is a knapsack!
I'm getting married today!
Do you think he knew I was here?
Nice try.
Wait, wait, wait.
Look, Monica-Ah!
Look! This is not gonna work. I bet this'll work.
You are so great! I love you.
What?
Nothing! I said, I said you're so great, and then I just, I just stopped talking.
You said you love me! I can't believe this! No, I didn't.
Yes, you did. No, I didn't!
You love me! No, I don't!
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
You know, I was thinking, what if I, uh, unpack here?
Then all your stuff would be here.
Well...
What if all my stuff was here?
Then you'd be going back and forth all the time.
Doesn't make any sense.
0Kay.
What if we live together, and you understand what I'm saying?
You wanted it to be a surprise.
Oh, my God!
Chandler...
...in all my life...
...I never thought I'd be so lucky...
...as to fall in love with my best--
My best-There's a reason why girls don't do this!
Okay, okay, okay! I'll do it.
I thought--
I can do this.
I thought...
...that it mattered what I said or where I said it.
Then I realized the only thing that matters is that you--
You make me happier than I ever thought I could be.
And if you let me...
...I'll spend the rest of my life trying to make you feel the same way.
Monica?
Will you marry me?
Yes.
Can we come in? We're dying out here!
Come in! Come in!
We're engaged! Yes!
Hey. Hey.
Hi. What have you guys been up to?
Oh, we were helping Chandler write his vows. but he kicked us out
because Joey kept making inappropriate suggestions.
How is "Monica, I love your sweet ass" inappropriate?
How's Monica coming along with her vows?
Well let's just say its she's lucky she's got a sweet ass. She's not so good at writing.
I can't believe in four weeks they're gonna be married!
Let's just hope it works.
Y"know nine out of 1O marriages end in divorce.
Phoebe that's not true.
Yeah, you're right. How's the missus?
I can't believe...
...they've been together 3 years. Has it been that long?!
Believe me, it seems like less because they hid it from us for so long.
Hey, it's me. Coming in.
I've had a very long, hard day.
Ahh, I'm gonna go get some chicken. Want some? Ahh, no thanks. No chicken, bye-bye then.
Are you okay? I'm so sorry.
He wouldn't leave. He kept asking if I wanted chicken.
Chicken?
I could eat some chicken.
Hey, Joe!
Can I get a, uh, three-piece, some cole slaw, some beans, and a Coke—
Diet Coke.
I don't know why they didn't just tell us. I know, I mean it's not like we weren't cool about it.
You? And you?
Yes, but you cannot tell anyone! No one knows.
How? When?
It happened in London. In London?
The reason we didn't tell anyone was because we didn't want to make a big deal out of it.
But it is a big deal!
I have to tell someone. No-no-no-no-no!
You can't. Please! Please?!
We just don't want to deal with telling everyone, okay? Just promise you won't tell.
All right!
I can't wait to be with you!
I'll just tell Rachel I'm gonna be doing laundry for a couple of hours.
Laundry, huh? Is that my new nickname?
You know what your nickname, Mr. Big--
Oh, look, there's Monica and Chandler. Hey! Hey, you guys! Hey!
Chandler and Monica!
Chandler and Monica!
Oh, my God!
Aah! Chandler and Monica! Oh, my God!
Oh, my eyes! My eyes! Phoebe! Phoebe!
It's okay! It's okay! No! They're doing it!
I know! I know!
You know? Yes! I know!
And Joey knows! but Ross doesn't know so you have to stop screaming!
Hey, what's going on?
What? What?
Nothing! Oh God, we're just so excited that you want to get this apartment!
Actually, it looks really good. It looks pretty good!
Get in here! Come on!
Okay, so now they know that you know and they don't know that Rachel knows?
Yes, but y'know what? it doesn't matter who knows what.
Now, enough of us know that we can just tell them that we know.
Then all the lying and the secrets would finally be over!
Or, we can not tell them we know and have a little fun of our own.
All right honey, We better go if we're gonna catch that movie.
Bye. Bye.
Bye, Chandler. I miss you already.
Okay, did you see that?! With the inappropriate pinching?
Actually, I did.
So now do you believe that she's attracted to me?
Oh, my God! My God, she knows about us!
Phoebe knows about us! Well I didn't tell them.
Them? Who's them?
Uh, Phoebe and Joey.
Joey!
And Rachel.
I would've told you but they made me promise not to tell.
Oh man, they think they are so slick, messing with us!
But see they don't know that we know that they know.
So... Ah, yes!
Ahh yes, the messers become the mes-sees!
My God, he wants me to come over and feel his biceps and more!
Are you kidding? No.
I can't believe he'd do that to Mo--
Joey? Do they know that we know?
No. Joey!
They know you know. Ugh! I knew it!
Oh I cannot believe those two!
God, they thought that they could mess with us? They're trying to mess with us?!
They don't know that we know they know we know.
Joey, you can't say anything.
I couldn't even if I wanted too.
Listen, this is totally getting out of hand.
Okay? She wants me to put lotion on her! She's bluffing!
Look, she's not backing down. She went like this.
He's not backing down. He went to get lotion.
Oh, man. Aren't you guys done yet?
Joey look, just look at it this way, the sooner Phoebe breaks Chandler the sooner this is all over and out in the open.
Ooh, I like that. Okay.
Okay, show him your bra. He's afraid of bras. Can't work them.
Wow! You didn't rip off any buttons.
It's not my first time.
You go back out there and you seduce her until she cracks.
Okay, give me a second.
Did you clean up in here? Of course.
Oh, you're, uh, going?
Um, not without you, lover.
So, this is my bra.
It's very, very nice.
Well, come here.
I'm very happy we're gonna have all the sex.
You should be. Heh. I'm very bendy.
I'm gonna kiss you now. Not if I kiss you first.
Well, I guess there's nothing left for us to do but-but kiss.
Here it comes.
Our first kiss.
Okay, okay, okay, fine, you win! You win!! Ha!
I can't have sex  with ya! And why not?!
Because I'm in love with Monica!! You're what?
Love her! That's right, I love her! I love her!
I love you, Monica.
I love you too, Chandler.
I thought you guys were doing it, I didn't know you were in love.
That's it, it's over. Everybody knows.
Well actually, Ross doesn't. Yes, and we'd appreciate it if no one told him yet.
No. No! Wh
What are you doing?
Get off my sister!
Y'know, you're friends getting married, it's gotta change things.
You really think it'll be that different?
How can it not be? I mean pretty soon they're gonna have kids...
...and then they're just gonna be hanging out with other couples who have kids.
And then maybe they're gonna have to leave the city...
...to be near a Volvo dealership.
Well, things change.
I don't want them to move to a Volvo dealership.
It'll be okay, Joe. Heh.
Sorry. I just-I like things the way they are.
Who's this little naked guy?
Uh, that naked guy would be me.
Ha, aw, look at the little thing. Ha-ha-ha.
Yes.
Yes, fine, that is my penis. Can we be grownups now?
Who are those people? Got me.
Oh, that's Nana right there in the middle.
Wow. Let's see.
"Me and the gang at Java Joe's."
Wow. Monica, you look just like your grandma. How old was she?
Let's see, 1939.
Yeah, uh, 24, 25.
Huh. Looks like a fun gang.
Ooh! Look, look, look! I got Monica naked.
Let me see.
No, that would be me again.
Hey, you guys.
Hey. Hey.
What's going on? Well, we were just talking about...
...you guys getting married and how great it is.
Yeah, you can get a Volvo. If that's what you really want.
Oh that's so sweet. Hmm.
So, we both finished our vows. Can we read them?
Yeah, I don't hear Chandler's and he doesn't hear mine.
Okay. Okay.
Oh, that's beautiful.
Funny one! That's good!
Monica,  will-will you marry me?
Ha-ha-ha. What? I don't get it.
Oh, yeah!
Oh man, this is hilarious! Chandler!
Don't worry, we'll make yours funnier.
Okay, what do you guys think?
Dude... I have never known love like this.
You really like it? Dude!
How did you write this?
I stole Monica's and changed the name. Shh.
You can't do that! If he goes first he can!
Hey. Hey.
Hey uh Mon, I saw the Porsche parked out front.
Can I get the keys? Thought I'll take that bad boy out for a little spin.
Wait a minute! You let Ross drive the Porsche and when I ask you, you say you're the only one who's allowed to drive it.
Yeah, well he's my brother, And plus he drives so slow he couldn't never hurt it.
It's a car, Monica, not a rocket ship.
Whatever, Ross.
Just replace the bulbs in the brake lights after you're done.
Hey. Hi.
Saw the Porsche  out there Mon, Looking good. When do I get to take that baby out again?
You let Joey drive it? I've never driven it. Okay? Not once.
Okay, once. Okay, I drive it all the time.
Nice work everybody! So much for the y'know, "you can drive it but don't tell Rachel" plan.
Wow, I can't believe you lied to me.
Okay, I can fix this. Okay Monica, Rachel thinks all you can talk about is the wedding.
Great! Well Rachel, the reason why I won't let you drive the Porsche is because you're a terrible driver.
There. That wasn't about the wedding.
Look Rach if-if you want to go for a ride in the Porsche, I’ll be glad to take you for a quick spin around the block.
Yeah, you got a couple hours?
Friends  S07E22  The One With Chandler's Dad
Whew, that was a brisk ride.
Take the top down, did you? Only way to fly.
Come on Ross give me the keys. Monica does not know what she's talking about! I'm an excellent driver.
You're fast and irresponsible. That adds up to a bad driver.
Well in high school, that added up to head cheerleader.
Did you see the look that girl just gave me, huh?
She must've seen me cruising in the bad boy.
I think she's checking out your beehive Ross. What?
Give me a brush. Give me the keys.
No way! Well, no brush.
Fine. Y'know what? It doesn't matter.
because, if I remember correctly, there's a comb on the floor of the bathroom.
Alimony.
Chandler, we still haven't gotten an RSVP from your dad.
Oh, right. Urn, maybe that's because I didn't send him an invitation.
Chandler, he's your father. He should be at your wedding.
I don't even know the man. Okay? We're not the close.I haven't seen him in years.
Well what are you gonna do when he finds out he wasn't even asked?
Well he doesn't have to know! It's not like we run in the same circles.
I hang out with you guys and he...
...stars in a drag show in Vegas.
Ooh, I think I want to trade circles.
Trust me, you don't want him there either. Okay? Nobody is gonna be stare at the bride...
...when the groom's father's wearing a back-less dress.
Heh, so what?
As long as he's not wearing a white dress and a veil, I don't care.
Okay, I think I need to do some shopping.
Ooh, nice.
My God!
What do you think you're doing? Just washing the windshield.
There's no way I am letting you drive this car.
So why don't you just hand over the keys?
No ah-ah-ah! Do not start this car.
Okay, okay. I will give you 2O bucks...
...if you get out of this car right now.
Look.
Ross, If you're so freaked out, just get in the car.
With you? Yeah, right.
All right.
Okay, okay, okay.
What are you doing? Get in front. In the death seat?
Hey, guys. Hi, sweetie.
Ready to go? Yeah! Sure! Ooh, I left my purse up at Monica's. I'll be right back.
Wait a minute. What?
Oh.
Ooh!
Whoa, oh, that one kept going.
So, you and Phoebe, huh?
How long have you been going out? Over a month
Wow. Maybe uh, maybe you and I ought to get to know each other a little better.
Sure. I'd like that. Yeah. So, uh...
What's your name?
It's Jake. Joey.
Hey Jake, Do you like the Knicks? Yeah, big fan.
Me too. There's a game on Tuesday. Do you want to go?
Yeah that would be great! Let me make sure I'm not doing anything Tuesday.
Here.
What's this? It's your suitcase. We're going to Las Vegas.
Are you serious? I mean like eloping?! No more stupid wedding stuff.
No more these flowers, or these flowers or these flowers— Think of the money we'll save.
We're not eloping. I love the flowers. Can our wedding be bigger, please?
We're going to Las Vegas to see your dad.
It's time you two talked, and I want to get to know my father-in-law.
Y'know we already went over this and I won.
No, you didn't. Oh and honey, just so you know...
Now that you're marrying me, you don't get to win anymore.
Look forget it okay? I don't want to go. I don't want to see him. I don't wanna.
Chandler, look I-I know that your dad embarrassed you. I know...
No-no all kids are embarrassed by their parents.
you'd have to come up with a whole new word for what I went through.
When I was in high school, he used to come to all my swim meets...
...dressed as a different Hollywood starlet.
It's hard enough to be 14.
You're skinny, You're wearing Speedos--That your morn promised you'd grow into.
You look up in the stands. There's your dad cheering you on.
Dressed as Carmen Miranda, wearing a headdress with real fruit...
...that he'll later hand out to your friends as a healthy snack.
Hey, the point is that he was at every one of your swim meets and he was there cheering you on.
Okay? That's a, that's a pretty great dad.
He had sex with Mr. Garibaldi.
Who's Mr. Garibaldi? Does it matter?
Chandler...
You're not 14 anymore, okay? Maybe it's time you let that stuff go.
If your father's not at your wedding, you're gonna regret it for the rest of your life.
Okay, but I'm just doing this for you.
Yes!
So I really never get to win anymore? How much did ever really win before?
Pheebs. Hey.
Listen, you know how, uh, when you're wearing pants and you lean forward...
...I check out your underwear?
Yeah.
Well, when Jake did it... Mm-hm.
...I saw that he was wearing women's underwear.
I know. They were mine.
No, no, wait. That's weird.
No, it’s not! We were just goofing around, and I dared him to try them on.
That's weird!
I'm wearing his briefs right now. That's kind of hot.
I think so too. And that little flap? Great for holding my lipstick.
Yeah, I wouldn't know about that.
And! Y'know what Jake says? That women's underwear is actually more comfortable.
And he loves the way the silk feels against his skin.
Yeah well next thing you know, he'll be telling you that your high heels are good for his posture.
There's nothing wrong with Jake. He is all man.
I'm thinking even more than you.
Oh yeah, he looked like a real lumberjack in those pink laoies.
I'm just saying that only a man completely secure with his masculinity...
...could walk around in women's underwear. I don't think you could ever do that.
Hey! I am secure with my masculinity. Okay, whatever.
You've seen my huge stack of porn right?
God, I forgot how much I love driving.
I have got to get my license renewed.
You don't have a valid driver's license? Okay that is it! Pull over right now.
Oh Ross you're so tense. You just gotta relax,
Okay? Just need to relax. All right? Just need to relax.
What-what are you doing?! Are you—Okay that's not funny. Just stop horsing around.
I am not horsing around, okay?
I am "Porsche-ing" around.
Okay, stay calm. Nothing is going to happen to you, You're not in that much trouble.
Really? You think so?
I'm talking to myself. You're going down!
Has someone taken your order yet?
Oh, yeah. She did. Um, he did. She? I'm sorry, I'm new. I don't...
Yeah, I just ordered a beer. You're straight. I get it.
I still say that if we had called your dad, we'd have better seats.
No! No! I don't want him to know we're here yet. I'm not sure I'm ready for that.
And besides he's not gonna be too happy to see me either.
Why not?
I don't know if I've told you this, but he's kind of tried to get in contact with me...
...a lot over the last few years. What?
Yeah. He's made phone calls, written letters.
He even came to New York. but I always said I was too busy to see him.
Y'know it's very "Cat's in the Cradle." I don't want to get into it.
Here we go.
Ladies and gentlemen...
...please welcome the incomparable Helena Handbasket.
Hello, darlings.
And there's Daddy.
Okay. Switch places with me. Switch places with me! Come on! I'll go under, you go over.
Yeah, I'll get right on that. Ugh, come on Ross!!
What'? No. Hey, Rash, come on.
Yeah, I'm sure we won't get arrested for this.
God!
Hi, officer. Was I going a little too fast?
Oh, my God.
Can I see your license, please? Oh, yes, absolutely.
Y'know, it's weird. but I had a dream last night where I was stopped by a policeman.
And then he, um...
Well, I probably shouldn't tell you the rest.
Your license. Yes. Ahem. Here you go, Officer, uh...
...Handsome.
It's Hanson. Oops, sorry. My mistake.
Dear Lord!
Wow! Here it comes.
This is a great picture.
Really? You think so? You know, I had just rolled right out of bed.
Yeah? Well you look phenomenal.
Well she should! It was taken 1O years ago!
You know, you're probably, um...
Probably wondering about the old date.
Yes, I am. You're an Aquarius, huh?
I'll bet you're a Gemini. No.
Taurus? No.
Virgo? No.
Sagittarius? Yep.
I knew it. I knew it!
Well I tell you what... You won't speed anymore, right? I won't speed.
And you promise you'll get this taken care of right away? I promise.
And in the meantime you better let him drive. Does he have a license?
Yeah. Can he handle a stick?
Oh, well... I can handle a stick!
That can't be your father. Believe me, I've been saying that for years.
Oh, my God! What?
That's Mr. Garibaldi playing the piano.
Hello, and welcome to the show.
I see some of our regulars in the audience.
And a couple of irregulars.
He's coming into the audience. He's coming into the audience. Relax. You'll be fine.
Oh, much better. You're invisible now.
Where are you from'? Bakersfield.
I'm sorry? Bakersfield.
No, no, I heard. I'm just sorry.
It can't happen like this. Okay? I'll meet you back at the hotel.
Oh Look, a standing ovation already. So early in the show.
Oh turn around, darling. Let me see your pretty face.
Can we have our drinks, please? Uh, waiter? --tress?
Hey, Pheebs. Hey.
Check it out.
How much of a man am I?
Wow, nice. Manly, and also kind of a slut.
You know, I'm beginning to see what Jake was talking about.
Uh-huh. The silk feels really good.
And things aren't as smashed down as I thought they would be.
That's great Joe!
Yeah! And you have so many more choices than you do with men's underwear.
Bikini, French cut, thong. And the fabrics: You've got cotton, silk, lace.
And you know what I've always wondered about? Pantyhose!
Y'know? The way they start at your toe and go all the way up to here
I should go take these off off shouldn't I? I think it's important that you do.
So what's your name?
Chandler.
Chandler?
What an unusual name.
You must have had terribly fascinating parents.
Oh, they're a hoot.
And who is your friend?
I'm Monica.
Monica. Where are you from? New York.
I'm not very fond of New York.
Queens, I like.
Ooh, what is this...
...sparkling something, honey, huh?
Actually, Monica and I are engaged.
Really?
Congratulations.
When's the big day?
In...in two weeks.
I see.
Well, I wish you both a lifetime of happiness.
So you're bald.
Wait, wait.
We'd really love it if you could be there.
Really?
I know it would make me happy...
...ma'am.
Then I wouldn't miss it for the world.
Oh, I'm getting all misty here. Ha!
You'd think I was having my legs waxed or something.
You okay? Yeah.
Thanks for making me do this.
Before we go on with the show, I just want to say to the bride and groom...
...how lucky they are to have found each other.
In every life a little rain must fall.
Fortunately...
...in my life...
When I was growing up, I played the one on the far left.
Remind me to introduce you to someone.
Who? Fourth gear.
What?
What does he want? I wasn't doing anything.
Well maybe he saw your hands slip briefly from the 10 and 2:00 position.
Maybe it's, uh, Sergeant Sagittarius coming back to flirt some more.
It's a different guy.
Good evening, officer. Do you know how fast you were going?
Uh, no, I don't, but it could not have been more than 60.
You're right. It was 37.
I mean you're not gonna give me ticketing for driving too slow, are you?
That's right.
You know, officer, I, uh...
I had the weirdest dream last night.
Oh, my God!
Your license, please.
You don't want to hear about my dream...
...Officer...
...Pretty?
It's Petty.
I'll be right back with your ticket.
You have a son. I know. I know.
Feel better? Yeah. Much. Heh.
Listen, uh...
Not that I'm y'know insecure about my manhood or anything y'know, but, uh...
...I think I need to hook up with a woman right now.
Yeah, I understand. Yeah, okay.
Hey. Hi. Hi.
y'know, You look familiar. Do I know you from somewhere?
I don't think so.
Oh! Maybe it's because I'm on television.
I'm an actor on Days of our Lives. Wow. Really?
Four-fifty, please. Oh, let me get this.
These are for you.
Do you realize this is probably the last time we'll be here in the coffee house...
...as six single people?
What's happening to the coffee house?
Oh! Okay.
Yep! From now on, it's gonna be the four of you guys and me and the missus.
The little woman. The wife. The old ball and chain.

But yeah, I can go. Sure.
Y'know what? Actually, I'm kinda glad they're leaving. 'cause uh,
I need to talk to you about something.
What's up? Well this uh, This may be a little awkward.
Listen, if you want to borrow money, its kind of a bad time. I'm buying dinner for 128 people tomorrow.
No, it's not that.
now what I'm going to say to you, I’m not saying as your friend. Okay?
... I'm-I'm saying as it as Monica's older brother.
But you're still my friend? Not for a few minutes.
During this time... are you, are you still my best man? Nope.
Do I still call you Ross? Okay.
You guys are getting married tomorrow and-and I couldn't be more thrilled for both of you,
But as Monica's older brother, I have to tell you this:
If you ever hurt my little sister...
...if you ever cause her any unhappiness of any kind...
...I will hunt you down...
...and kick your ass.
What? I'm-I'm-I'm serious!
Come—Hey! Dude! Stop it! Okay? I'm not kidding here! I hear what you're saying okay? and...
...thanks for the warning.
No problem.
So are we friends again?
Yeah. Okay.
Okay. You won't believe what Monica's older brother just said to me!
Friends  S07E23 The One With Chandler and Monica’s Wedding

I'm doing my scenes with you? Nice to meet you Joey.
Wow! I can't believe this. This is incredible. I mean you just won an Oscar.
No, I didn't.

So what are we gonna do?!  We have no reinforcements! No-no food!
No, we still have food in the basement. I saw potatoes and some dry pasta.
Hang on a minute!  Joey, you keep touching your face.
Is something wrong?
No. Nope,
I, uh...
I thought it might be kind of a cool character thing.
Y'know? He's uh, he's a face toucher.
I don't think so.
Let's take it back to Richard's last lines. Action!
We may not have any weapons, but we still have food.
In the basement I saw potatoes, and some dry pasta...
...and a few tins of tuna!
Honey, we gotta go! Okay.
Okay. Here's a question you never want to ask:
My dad just called and wants to know if he can borrow one of your pearl necklaces?
Did he say what kind of neckline he's wearing?
No.
Well. I've only met him once but I'm guessing, plunging?
Yeah. He is more of a "if you've got it, flaunt it" kind of father.
I don't have anything but let me go see if Rachel does.
Yes, include more people in this.
Okay. Do you realize that at this time tomorrow  we'll be getting married?
Wait a minute! I have a date tomorrow night.
I just, I can't believe we made it. Well you don't have to sound so surprised.
I'm sorry, but...
Nothing. What?
Well, honestly? Ever since we got engaged...
...I have been waited for something to, to flip you out.
Honestly? Me too.
Really? Yeah.
Y'know I keep thinking that something stupid is gonna come up and I'll...
...go all Chandler.
But nothing has. Ohh, I'm so glad.
Thank you so much for staying so calm during this.
I mean it's really, It's made me stay calm.
I could've been worse. Okay.
I'll be right there.
Hi, if you're calling before Saturday...
...you've reached Monica and Chandler.
But if you're calling after Saturday, you've reached Mr. and Mrs. Bing.
Please leave a message for the Bings!
Hey Maureen! Hi.
Gosh. Hey uh, Chandler? This is my cousin, Maureen. We're the Bings.
Hi! Oh you guys look so beautiful.
Mr. and Mrs. Bing!
Wow, Monica.
Hey, just so you know, I had my older-brother talk with Chandler.
What is that? Well, I...
I told him that if he ever hurt you...
...I would hunt him down and kick his ass.
What?! What?! What is the matter with everybody? I'm serious.
I would kick his ass!
Ross, please, my makeup!
Hi.
Chandler. Mom.
Thanks for wearing...something.
Oh honey! This is so exciting! I thought we screwed you up so bad this day would never come.
Oh and just think, soon there will be lots of little Bings.
I can't believe I have to go back to work after this and get spit on again.
You're lucky. At least the people who spit on you are famous.
Who spits on you? I don't wanna talk about work.
Mrs. Bing? Here, These are my parents umm, Judy and Jack Geller.
It's lovely to meet you. So are you his mother or his father?
Jack!
What? I've never seen one before.
Dad, there's Ross. why don't you go talk to him.
I didn't even have a chance to act as though I'm okay with it.
Hello, all.
Hi...Dad.
Hi, Mr. Bing.
Nora. Charles.
It's so great to see you both here. Yes.
Although I think we may be seeing a little too much of some people.
Aren't you a little old to be wearing a dress like that?
Don't you have a little too much penis to be wearing a dress like that?
Oh, my God.
Of course you can kick his ass, son.
You could kick anyone's ass you want to.
Thanks, you guys.
Rach, Rash? Yeah?
Umm hey, could you do me a favor. and would talk to Chandler's dad and try to keep him away from Chandler's morn.
Yeah, but I don't know what he looks like. He is the man in a black dress.
Hi. I'm Rachel, a friend of Monica and Chandler's.
I'm Amanda. Oh, I get it.
"A man, duh!"
Can I have everyone's attention please?
I'm uh; I'm Ross Geller. Dr. Ross Geller.
Dad. Dad, please. As I was saying...
...I'm Dr. Ross Geller.
Uh, and I'm the best man.
And this marriage is doubly special for me...
...um, because not only is the groom my best friend...
...but, uh, the bride is my little sister.
She's the greatest sister a guy could ask for.
So if you'd all please join me in raising a glass...
...to the couple we're here to celebrate.
To the Bings. To the Bings!
All right, I'm gonna go steam my wedding dress okay?
Who wants the responsibility of making sure nothing happens to it?
I'll do it. Who wants it? Anybody?
I said I'll do it. Nobody wants to do it?
All right, I'll do it myself. Monica! I'm not gonna screw it up.
Y'know what? You're right. I'm sorry. Actually you were a big help tonight.
Yeah, and thanks for putting my grandmother in the cab and making sure she got to the hotel safely.
Well of course! That's what I'm here for. Okay. Sorry.
What grandmother?
Hey! Where have you been? Oh, taking my parents back to the hotel.
What? Are you going back to work? Yeah.
Nice shades. Thanks. Yeah, I figure if I wear these in my scenes...
...at least I won't get spit in the eyes, y'know?
And, if I remember correctly, Ray-Ban was the official sponsor of WWI.
Great!
I'll see you later. All right.
Hey, where's Chandler? I think he's in Rachel's room. See you.
Chandler?
Chandler?
Hey. Hi.
Is Monica here? She's steaming her dress. Why? What's up?
I think Chandler's gone. What?
He left that. "Tell Monica I'm sorry."
Oh, my God.
What's up?
"Tell Monica I'm sorry."
Tell her yourself.
Oh, my God. Chandler just left, though?
Yeah but, maybe it's not what we think. Maybe it's:
"Tell Monica I'm sorry I drank the last of the milk."
Or maybe he was writing to tell her that he's changed his name: y'know?
Tell Monica, I'm Sorry.
I think it means he freaked out and left! Don't be so negative!
Good God, isn't it possible that "Sorry" is sitting in there right now?
Okay. Phoebe, I think Ross is right. What are we gonna do?
Look—Okay, I'm just gonna-- I'm gonna have to go find him and bring him back. Okay?
You make sure Monica does not find out, okay?
Okay? But, if you don't find him and bring him back...
...I am gonna hunt you down and kick your ass!
I will, I will find him.
Hey Joey, Can you go through these lines with me?
Oh, man, they just re-did my makeup.
Just the last two pages. All right.
I found the picture!
Picture? What picture?
The picture of my wife! I found it in your pack!
Could you uh, could you lower your script?
I don't want to.
I need to see your face so I can play off your reaction.
Okay, look.
I know you're great actor, okay? And you play all those Shakespeare guys and stuff...
...but you're spitting all over me, man.
Well of course I am! You know you've been spitting on me?
That's what real actors do.
Enunciation is the mark of a good actor.
And when you enunciate, you spit!
Wow. Didn't know that.
Thanks. Okay, check it out.
Picture? What picture?
Gunther have you uh, have you seen Chandler? No, No. I haven't seen him.
Damn. He's getting married tomorrow, right?
Yes. Yes. Don't worry. Everything's fine.
we'll see you at the wedding. I wasn't invited.
Well then we'll-we'll see you the day after tomorrow.
Morn? Dad?
What-what…what you guys doing here?!
Well you kids talk about this place so much, we thought we'd see what all the fuss is about.
I certainly see why the girls like coming here. Why?
The sexy blonde behind the counter.
Gunther? Your mother just added him to her list.
What?  Your list? Yeah, the list that—Of people we're allowed to sleep--
Yes! No-no! I know, I know what the list is.
Sit down, have a cup of joe.
Dad? I can't, I'm sorry.
Look if you see Chandler, could you just let him know I'm looking for him.
And if you see Rita Moreno, let her know I'm looking for her.
Action!
I found the picture!
What picture?
A picture of my wife, in your pack!
You went through my personal property?
Why do you have a picture of Paulette in your pack?
Because, Vincent, we were lovers...
...for two years!
Cut! Wonderful!
Great scene, huh?
You were awesome. And, in that last speech, you soaked me.
Here's your call sheet for tomorrow. I'm not working tomorrow.
You are now. No! No! I can't! you gotta get me out of it.
I have got plans. Important plans!
Ross said there's still no word from Chandler. Oh, man.
Oh but he did say that they found the grandmother wandering down 5th.
Okay, well there's one down.
I'm getting married today!
I think I just cracked a rib, but I don't care because today's my wedding day!
My day is finally here!
Y'know she might not even notice he's gone.
I'm gonna start getting ready!
God! Don't—We can't let her start getting ready. This is too awful!
Oh God, but wait she'll be in the gown, and then he won't show up.
and then she'll have to take off the gown--
Stop it. Stop it Rachel! You can't do this here.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
It's just...It's just so sad.
Yeah, but you've got to pull yourself together! Monica can't see you like this.
Then she'll know something's wrong. I know. I know.
Oh God. There's no tissue.
Can you grab me some toilet paper?
Oh, that's gone too. This is Monica's bathroom, right?
No-no! I-I...I found one. Okay.
Oh thank you.
Oh, God.
Can I have another one?
Sure.
Do you need some floss?
Oh God I just can't imagine what will happen if Chandler doesn't show up.
Oh here's a whole bunch.
Oh, I mean she'll be at the wedding waiting for him ...
...and people will be whispering, "Oh that poor girl."
Y'know? Then she'll have to come back here and live all alone.
Oh, my God. What?
There was a pregnancy test in the garbage, and it's positive.
Monica's pregnant.
So I guess she won't be totally alone.
Next time on Friends:
We've gotta tell her that he's gone. No, we can't.
She's gonna start getting ready soon.
Can't you stall her a little?
I'm never gonna get married.
We've just got one short scene. It's just you and Richard, and he's a pro.
Are you drunk? No!
Yes, you are! All right.
How's Chandler? Great!
Where are you? On the set.
This is turning into the worst wedding day ever.
Oh, my God.
I know. Monica's gonna have a baby.
Hey, can this count as her "something new"?
Oh, my God.
Hey, do you think this is why Chandler took off?
No, she had to have just taken that test because I took out the trash last night.
Oh God, this is turning into the worst wedding day ever!
The bride's pregnant, the groom's missing and I'm still holding this.
Okay Phoebe, we cannot tell anyone about this.
Right. Okay? Yeah. Okay?
Hey, wait. Do you know what kind of birth control she was uses?
No. Why?
Just for the future. This is hardly a commercial for it.
Friends  S07E24  The One With Chandler and Monica's Wedding
Anything?
No. I talked to Joey on the set, He hasn't heard from him.
I talked to Chandler's parents again.
You told them he was missing? No.
I made it seemed like I was just calling to chat.
Pretty sure they both think I'm interested in them.
All right, we've got to tell her he's gone. No, Hey! Hey! we can't.
Ross, she's gonna start getting ready soon.
Well, can't you at least stall her a little? I'll go back to some of the places I went last night.
All right, well how much time do you need?
Well how much time before she absolutely has to start getting ready?
One hour. Give me two.
Then why do you ask?
Okay, wish me luck. Okay. I'm going with you.
Why?
Ross, you're tired. You've been looking all night. And clearly, you suck at this.
All right, I'll see you guys later.
Okay. Wait, do you know how you're gonna to stall her?
I'll figure something out. Okay, good luck.
Hey! Okay, so I thought we'd start with my makeup and then do my hair.
Okay. But before you do that, I need you to talk to me.
About what?
I'm never gonna getting married!
Yeah you will. The right guy's just around the corner.
Okay, are we done with that?
No Monica! I'm serious.
Oh, maybe I should just forget about it. Become a lesbian or something.
Any woman would be lucky to have you.
Well maybe it would make me feel better if I slept with Joey.
Rachel? You okay?
Excuse me, Aaron? Hi! Umm, I have a little problem with the schedule.
Originally, I wasn't supposed to work today. and I have this wedding that I really have to be at.
It's my best friend's, and I'm officiating...
...so I really can't work past 4.
Joey, you've gotta stay until the end. We can't stop filming just for you.
It's not like it's your wedding.
I'm having surgery.
What?
Yeah, I-I just made up the stuff about the wedding, because I didn't want you to worry about me.
But I'm having surgery today.
What kind of surgery?
Transplant.
But you're supposed to work on Monday.
Hair transplant.
But you're not bald.
It's not on my head.
Look Joey, there's nothing I can do. Besides, you'll probably gonna be out by 4 anyway.
We've got one short scene. It's just you and Richard, and God knows he's a pro.
You'll be fine.
Morning, Richard.
Hey, you're here. Great! Great! Great! Let's get going, buddy.
we've got a scene to shoot!
I'm wearing two belts.
Are you drunk? No.
Yes, you are.
All right.
So this is your office?
How'd you guys find me? I knew I should've hid at the gym.
What the hell are you doing? Panicking.
And using the Internet to try to prove that I'm related to Monica.
How is she? She's fine. She doesn't know you're gone.
And she doesn't have to know. okay? Now come on, we're going home.
No! No! I can't do that. Why not?
Because if I go home, we're gonna become the Bings.
I can't be the Bings.
What's wrong with being the Bings?
The Bings have horrible marriages.
They yell, They fight, And they use the pool boy...
...as a pawn in their sexual games.
Chandler, have you ever put on a black cocktail dress and asked me up to your hotel room?
No. Then you are neither of your parents.
It's not just their marriage. I mean, look at yours. Look at everybody's.
The only person that can make marriage work is Paul Newman!
And I've met me; I am not Paul Newman.
I don't race cars, I don't make popcorn. None of my proceeds go to charity.
But look Chandler...
...right now no one has a lower opinion of you than I do.
But I totally believe you can do this.
I want to. I love her so much, but I'm afraid--
Ahem. It's too huge.
Y'know, okay. You're right. It is huge.
So why don't we take it just a little bit at a time. Okay?
Umm, forget getting married for a sec. just forget about it.
Can you just come home and take a shower?
That's not scary, right?
Depends on what you mean by "we."
The nights are the hardest.
But then the day comes...
...and that's every bit as hard as the night.
And then the night comes again... The days and nights are hard, I get it.
Rachel I'm sorry! I have to start getting ready. I'm getting married today.
I know. At dusk.
That's such a hard time for me.
I'm gonna go put my make up on, We have to be at the hotel in an hour! Okay.
But wait! What?
Let's go to lunch.
I can't go to lunch.
Right.
Oh, good God, I've fallen down.
What's going on?
0Kay.
All right, honey, listen.
When I tell you what I'm about to tell you, I need you to remember...
...that we're all here for you, and that we love you.
Okay, you're-you're really freaking me out.
We can't find Chandler--
's vest.
We can't find Chandler's vest.
How can that be? Oh wait! Wait, Are you, are you serious?
Found the vest.
I mean we're gonna have to keep an eye on it, y'know make sure we don't lose it again.
Oh, wow. Okay, don't scare me like that, okay?
I mean for a minute, there I was like, "Oh, my God. The worst has happened."
So you two were married, huh?
What happened, you just drift apart?
Here comes the bride.
Oh, my God, Monica.
I want to wear this every day.
You look so beautiful.
I'm so happy for me.
Hello? Hey! Did Chandler show up yet?
Yeah, we got him back. Everything's fine. Damn it.
What? Why? Where are you? I'm still on the set.
Joey! The wedding is in less than an hour.
I know! I'm sorry. The guy's drunk. They won't let me go until we get this.
Oh, my God. I'm gonna have to find another minister.
No! No, I'm the minister.
All right, look-look, Put them both on the phone and I'll marry them right now.
Ugh! Joey, I have to go.
Hey! Don't hang up on me. I'll marry you and me right now. I have the power.
There you go. You put on a tuxedo.
Now that wasn't so scary, was it?
No.
I'm telling you, just a little bit at a time.
Yeah okay. Well, what's the next little bit?
Getting married. Okay. Okay.
You can, you can do that too. Just like you've done everything else.
Yeah, you're right. I can do that. Yeah.
Okay, excuse me for a minute. Wh—Hey—Whoa-whoa, where, where you going?!
Ross, I'm not gonna run away again! I just want to get a little fresh air.
okay. okay
Oh, fresh air.
Wait! Maybe, maybe you're overreacting! You do that y'know.
Well Phoebe, We gotta do something.
Well, y'know. I mean there's no way Joey's gonna make it in time. So I'm gonna through the hotel and see if there's any other weddings going on.
Okay. Oh but don't tell them Monica's pregnant, because they frown on that.
0Kay.
"Anastassakis Papasifakis wedding." Excellent.
Congratulations.
Mazel tov.
Hi. Oh, great hat.
Listen umm, I need you to perform another wedding. Can you do that?
I don't know. Are they Greek Orthodox?
Yeah. Yeah.
They're…they're-they're my friends, Monica Stephanopolis.
And Chandler Acidophilus.
Hi. Hi.
Hi.
Has umm, anyone seen Chandler?
I thought he was with you. He-he was with me umm,
We're playing a little game. y'know? Hide-and-seek.
You can't ask us, son. That's cheating.
You're right. Thanks for keeping me honest, Dad.
Well, he better not come by here. He can't see the bride in her wedding dress.
As I recall when we got married, I saw the groom in the wedding dress.
But that was after the wedding. It's not bad luck then.
Honey, it isn't good luck.
Oh, my God. Monica.
I know.
Hey, how's Chandler doing? Great.
He's doing great. Don't you worry about Chandler.
Phoebe, can I see you for a second? Yeah.
What's going on? Chandler's gone again.
Oh my God! Why would you play hide-and-seek with someone you know is a flight risk?
Aaron, you gotta let me go. The guy's hammered.
I'm sorry Joey, As long as he's here and he's conscious, we're still shooting.
You wouldn't happen to have a very big fork?
So I uh, I just talked to the director.
That's it. We're done for the day.
Well have we finished the scene?
Yeah. You were wonderful. As were you.
So I got your car. It's right outside.
Thank you. You're welcome.
No-no-no! we gotta go. Come on. Here we go.
Is that my ass?
There he is! What?
Hey! Whoa!
You're not getting away this time mister!
Unless you want that ass-kicking we talked about.
Ross. Hi-yah!
I'm serious. You're not walking out on my sister.
That's right. I'm not.
Then where the hell have you been? I know about Monica.
You know? What?
Yeah, I heard you and Rachel talking. What?! What?! Talking about what?!
You don't know?
Know what—If somebody doesn't tell me what's going on right now...
What, you'll "hi-yah"?
Monica's pregnant.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. And you're not freaking out?
Well I was. Then I went down to the gift shop because cigarettes.
Cigarettes? Big picture, please.
So I was in the gift shop, that's when I saw this...
Yeah, y'know what? And I thought anything that can fit into this can't be scary.
Well you obviously didn't see Chuckie III.
But come on, look at how cute and small this is.
So I got it to give Monica, so she'd know I was okay.
Dude.
Way to go, son. I knew you'd find him.
Our little boy is getting married.
Oh Look at you, so handsome.
You look beautiful, Mom.
You look beautiful too, Dad.
I love you both.
I'm so glad you're here.
Are you Chandler?
Are you Joey?
Huh. This is nice. What?
I've never walked down the aisle knowing it can't end in divorce.
Oh I wish your grandmother had lived to see this.
She's right there. Not that old crone. My mother.
Congratulations, darling.
We love you, sweetheart.
You look beautiful.
Is this new? Not now.
Who's this? I'm Father Karabasos.
He's Greek Orthodox.
As are you.
Let us begin.
Dearly beloved--
That's my line.
I can take it from here. Thanks.
Dearly beloved, I'm sorry I'm a little late.
You may be confused by this now...
...but you won't be Memorial Day weekend, 2002.
Well, let's get started before the groom takes off again.
We are gathered here today...
...to join this man...
...and this woman in the bonds of holy matrimony.
I've known Monica and Chandler for a long time, and I can't...
...imagine two people more perfect for each other.
And now, as I've left my notes in my dressing room...
...we shall proceed to the vows. Monica?
He took off? Go on. Go on.
Chandler, for so long...
...I wondered if I would ever find my prince.
My soul mate.
Then three years ago, at another wedding...
...I turned to a friend for comfort.
And instead, I found everything that I'd been looking for my whole life.
And now...
...here we are...
...with our future before us.
And I only want to spend it with you.
My prince. My soul mate.
My friend.
Unless you don't want to.
You go.
Chandler?
No, that's okay.
Monica I thought this was going to be the most difficult thing I ever had to do.
But when I saw you walking down that aisle, I realized how simple it was.
I love you.
Any surprises that come our way, it's okay, because I will always love you.
You are the person I was meant to spend the rest of my life with.
You want to know if I'm sure?
You may now kiss the bride.
So...
I guess by the powers vested in me by the State of New York...
...and the Internet guys...
...I now pronounce you husband and wife.
Oh, wait. Do you take each other?
I do. I do.
Yeah, you do.
Rings?
Oh, crap. Okay—uh…
uh let's-let's do the rings.
We good? Yeah? Good?
Once again...
...I pronounce you husband and wife.
Now kiss her again.
I love you.
And I know about the baby.
What baby? Our baby.
We have a baby?
Phoebe found your pregnancy test in the trash.
I didn't take a pregnancy test.
Then who did?
Look at them.
And they're gonna have a baby.
