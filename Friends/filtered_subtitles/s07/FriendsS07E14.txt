瑞秋  别这样012---Rach, come on. Rach!
是你的生日啊012---It's your birthday.
嘿012---Hey.
她不像她29岁时那么漂亮了012---She's not as pretty as she was when she was 29.
在葛林小姐出来之前  要先把几件事说清楚012---Ms. Green would like to establish some ground rules before she comes out.
她希望你们不要用到如"或者" "走下坡"等字眼012---She would appreciate it if you didn't use the words "old" or "downhill"...
或是 "它们看来还是很棒"012---...or "They still look pretty damn good."
它们还是012---They do.
瑞秋  出来012---Rachel, come on out.
摩妮卡做了早餐012---Monica made breakfast.
巧克力碎片松饼012---Chocolate chip pancakes.
我们有礼物给你012---We've got presents.
好礼物012---Good ones?
都是两星期前你给的单子上的012---They all came from the list you handed out to us two weeks ago.
我可以只收礼物  而仍然是29岁吗012---Well, can I keep the presents and still be 29?
瑞秋  30岁也没什么大不了的012---Come on, Rach, look, turning 3O is not that big a deal.
真的嘛  你满30岁时也是这么觉得吗012---Oh, really? Is that how you felt when you turned 30?
为什么  上帝  为什么啊012---Why, God, why?
我们讲好的了  让其他人变老  我不要012---We had a deal. Let the others grow old, not me.
只有我这样吗  是我反应过度吗012---Oh, come on, you guys, is it just me? Am I overreacting to this?
不  不是只有你  我的30岁生日也不好过012---No, Rach, it is not just you. My 30th birthday certainly wasn't that much fun.
现在该钱德了012---And now Chandler.
我们都变得这么老了012---We're all getting so old.
为什么这样对我们012---Why are you doing this to us'?
老友记  第七季  第14集  步入三十012---Friends  S07E14  The One Where They All Turn Thirty
你的生活过得很好  有很棒的工作  很好的朋友012---Rach, you're in a great place in your life. You have an amazing job, good friends.
你的室友是连续剧明星012---Yeah, your roommate's a soap opera star.
你的角色在昏迷中012---Your character is in a coma.
我答应自己这个生日一定不哭012---I promised myself I wasn't gonna cry at this one.
我知道我目前过得很好  但我看到一些人012---I know my life's going pretty well, but I see so many people...
在30岁以前  就完成了他们的目标012---...who've accomplished so many of their goals by the time they're 30.
是啊  你不应该和我比012---Yeah, but you shouldn't compare yourself to me.
来  菲比  你做得到的012---Come on, Phoebe. You can do it Phoebe! Come on!
来了  好了012---Come on. There you go.
我成功了  在跳跳球上走了一哩012---I did it. One mile on a Hippity Hop.
30岁前我想完成的事012---That's it. That's everything I wanted to do before I was 30.
除了我想和我妹修好关系外012---Oh, except I wanted to patch things up with my sister.
嗯  可是012---Oh, well. But, yaw.!
女人  这东西是上帝给的礼物  如果你懂我的意思012---And, girls, this thing is a godsend, if you know what I mean. Heh.
来做点有趣的事吧  今天你想做什么012---Come on, let's have some fun, huh? What do you want to do today?
什么也不做   我什么也不想做012---Nothing. I don't want to do anything.
在30岁生日时什么都不做  总比像罗斯一样做傻事好012---Well, doing nothing on your 30th is better than doing something stupid, like Ross.
那是很实际的一次购买012---Hey, that was a practical purchase.
我需要那个车子做交通工具012---I needed that car for transportation.
好吗  我有小孩012---Okay? I have a child.
我在这车里看来很拉风吧012---How hot do I look in this, huh?
罗斯  一台跑车012---Ross, a sports car?
在裤子里塞袜子不是比较便宜012---Wouldn't it be cheaper to just stuff a sock down there?
这不是为了那个012---That's not what this is about, okay?
我是跑车爱好者012---I am a sports car enthusiast.
我一直都很喜欢车  它的马力多少012---I've always been into cars. What's the horsepower on this thing?
不知道  看看它多亮呀012---I don't know, but look how shiny.
你竟然买了这台车  帅哥  那就载我一程吧012---I can't believe you bought this. So can I have a ride, stud?
上车吧012---Hop in.
准备好你这辈子最稳的一程012---Get ready for the smoothest ride of your life.
可恶012---Damn it.
我好了  下一个是谁012---Okay, who's next?
今天我一定要做点什么012---You know what? I am gonna do something today.
我不能像老太太一样闲坐在这儿012---I'm not just gonna sit around like some old lady.
我要在身上打个洞012---I want to get something pierced.
像是鼻子  舌头  或是别的地方012---Like my, uh, nose or my tongue or something.
真的  那样会痛的012---Really? Because, you know, that hurts.
那又怎样   我是这么想的012---So what? You know, the way I see it--
该死的012---Ow! Son of a bitch.
瑞秋  我知道你经历过的012---Look, Rachel, I know what you're going through.
我25岁生日时吓坏了012---I'm totally freaked out about turning 25.
离开我家012---Get out, get out of my apartment.
瑞秋  你做的很好012---Rach, for what it's worth, I think that you're doing great.
正视事实吧  没有人能真的  好好处理这件事012---I mean, y'know let's face it, no one handles this well.
至少你不行012---Heh. Least of all you.
放回去吧   摩妮卡随时会到家的012---Would you put that back on. Monica's gonna be here any minute.
可是我的 "乔伊结"会痛012---But it hurts my Joey's apple.
最后一次告诉你那叫喉结   不是以每一个人的名字命名的012---Okay, for the last time, it's not named after each individual man.
钱德  你宴会办得真好012---You've done a wonderful job with this party, Chandler.
每样东西看起来都很美丽  没有像你这么美丽的012---Everything looks so lovely. Oh, well, not as lovely as you.
不能相信你有位30岁的女儿012---I mean, I can't believe you would have a 30-year-old daughter.
不能相信你有件30岁的燕尾服012---And you, I can't believe you would have a tux that's 30 years old.
还不止30年  怀上罗斯那次  这件燕尼服就有了012---It's older than that. Ross was actually conceived right near this tuxedo.
哦012---Oh.
大家躲起来  我看到她了  她来了012---Okay, everybody hide. I saw her. She's coming.
蹲下  大家蹲下012---Okay, okay. Everybody down. Everybody down.
留在这儿  我来看看怎么了012---Okay, everybody stay here. I will find out what's going on.
你开门了  嘿012---Hey, you got the door open.
嘿  你喝醉了吗012---Hey, are you drunk?
没有012---No.
好012---0Kay.
哇哦012---Whoa.
好012---0Kay.
我对要满30岁012---See I was, I was a little nervous about turning...
还是有点紧张012---...30.
收碗的小弟带我去喝酒012---So the busboys took me out for some drinks.
待会可能会吐在你身上012---Might want to puke on you later.
事情是这样的  我们替你办了一个惊喜宴会012---Okay, here's the thing. We have thrown a very formal surprise party for you in there!
你的朋友和父母都在里面012---All your friends are in there and your parents.
不  是的012---No. Yes.
不  是的012---No. Yes.
哦  不  我父母从没看我醉过012---Oh, no. My parents have never seen me drunk.
就他们所知012---That they know of.
这样  我们替你弄点咖啡喝   他们就不知道你醉了012---Okay, Here's the thing. We'll get you some coffee and they will never know that you're drunk.
真的  你确定  我会处理好的012---Really, you promise? Yeah, I'll take care of it.
我好爱你012---Okay, I love you so much.
好了  要处理处理你口里的酒气012---Okay, we have to do something about your breath.
那你的酒气呢012---What about your breath?
那还是你的酒气012---That's still yours.
记住  这是一个惊喜012---Okay, now, remember, it's a surprise party.
你进去时要显得很惊讶012---So when you go in, act surprised.

退后  停012---Okay, back-Stop!
好  前停  好  停停012---Okay, for-Stop! Stop! Stop!
好吧  要不我们这么做012---Okay. Okay, here's what we're gonna do.
我打开车门  放在空档012---I'm gonna break into this minivan, put it in neutral.
你们把它向前推  罗斯就能开出来了012---You guys push it forward so Ross can drive out of the spot.
好  来吧012---Okay? All right. Here we go.
快逃啊012---Haul ass!
30岁生日快乐  给你012---Happy 30th birthday. Here.
献给你的童心  还有你的女人心012---It's for the child in you. And the woman.
30岁快乐012---Happy 30th.
你为什么一直这么说012---Right, Why do you keep saying that?
因为这是我们的30岁生日012---Because it's our 30th birthday.
不  我们不是30   我们31岁了012---Yeah, no, we're not 30. We're 31. Okay.
等一下012---Wait.
哦  是你012---Oh, it's you.
是  怎么012---Yeah. What?
对  我们不是30  我们是31012---Yeah, we're not 30. We're 31.
我的出生证明上是这么写的012---Yuh-huh. That's what it says on my birth certificate.
你有出生证明012---You have your birth certificate?
我妈去世时  我拿到了一箱子的家庭文件012---Yeah, I got a big box of family stuff when my mom died.
我们的妈012---Our mom.
好  好012---Right. Okay.
你有我的吗  没有  我卖给了那个瑞典逃犯了012---Do you have my birth certificate? No, I sold it to a Swedish runaway.
我的老天012---Oh, my God.
我的老天  我们31了012---Oh, my God, we are 31.
是啊012---Yeah.
我失去了整整一年的生命012---I just lost a whole year of my life.
对啊012---0Kay.
你的纪念名字是潘蜜拉  对012---Your middle name is Pamela? Yes.
我从不知道我的是什么  你记得是什么吗012---Oh, I never knew mine. Do you remember what it is?
记得  是菲比012---Yes. Phoebe.
那是我的正式名字  对  好吧  那我不知道012---That's my first name. Right. Okay. Then, no.
看着前面  我们成功地穿过了客厅  你做的很好012---Look at that. We made it all the way across the room. You're doing great.
怎么回事  摩妮卡有一点醉了012---What's going on? Monica's a little drunk.
我喜欢酒醉的摩妮卡012---Yay, I love drunk Monica.
她比正常的摩妮卡有趣多了012---Oh, she's so much more fun than regular Monica.
她不想让她的父母知道012---She doesn't want her parents to know she's drunk.
好  好  我们这么做012---Oh, all right, all right. Here's what we'll do.
我来比她醉得厉害两倍  这样就没有人会注意她了012---I'll get twice as drunk as Monica and then no one's even gonna notice her.
怎么了012---What's going on?
摩妮卡醉了012---Monica's wasted.
或许能让这个宴会有点生机012---Maybe that'll liven up this party.
你能不能帮她换衣服012---Okay, will you just go help her get changed, please?
照顾酒醉  裸体的女人  好像是乔伊的工作012---Okay, but taking care of a drunk, naked woman seems like a job for Joey.
对012---Yep.
这是我的礼物012---This one's from me. Ah.
这不在你的礼单上  不过它真的很好玩012---It wasn't on your list, but hopefully you'll think it's really fun.
滑板车012---A scooter.
照着单子买012---Stick to the list.
永远记得照着单子买012---Always stick to the list.
不  不  我很喜欢  谢谢012---No, no, no, I love it. Thank you.
下一个开我们的礼物  下一个开我们的012---Okay, open ours next. Open ours next.
你们现在是一对  我们就没两个礼物了012---Now that you're a couple, we don't get two presents from you guys?
我上一个生日  你送我一个拥抱012---For my last birthday, you gave me a hug.
念卡片  念卡片012---Okay, read the card, read the card. Okay.
"生日快乐  祖母012---"Happy birthday, Grandma.
开始走下坡总比012---It's better to be over the hill...
被埋在坡下要好012---...than buried under it.
我们爱你  摩妮卡和钱德"好好笑012---All our love, Monica and Chandler." That's funny.
不  不  只是一个玩笑012---No, no, no, no. That was a joke.
我知道  我懂了  很好笑012---No, I know, I get it. It's funny.
因为你不是祖母012---No, because you're not a grandmother.
做为一个祖母  必须结了婚有小孩012---No I know, because to be a grandmother, you have to be married and have children.
我全都没有  所以真的很好笑012---and I don't have any of those things. That's why it's so funny.
我要012---I'm just gonna go...
你只需要买张卡片而己012---All you had to do was buy the card.
你知道吗012---Okay, you know what?
为着没有先生孩子就不高兴  是很笨啊012---I realized it was stupid to get upset about not having a husband and kids.
我只需要有一个计划012---All I really needed was a plan.
我想生三个小孩012---See, I wanna have three kids.
你要全部同一个时候生012---Let me guess. And you want to have them all at the same time...
把他们给你弟弟012---...and you want to have them for your brother. Ha, ha.
我正在说012---As I was saying...
我应该在35岁以前生第一个012---I should probably have the first of the three kids by the time I'm 35, right?
这样我还有五年012---Which gives me five years.
如果我35时要生孩子  我34岁时才需要怀孕012---So if I wanna have a kid when I'm 35, I don't have to get pregnant until I'm 34.
普拉达还有四年时间生产孕妇装012---Which gives Prada four years to start making maternity clothes.
我想在怀孕之前至少结婚一年012---Oh, wait, but I do want to be married for a year before I get pregnant.
真的  要那么久012---Really? That long?
你爱怎么看都行  已经在发生了012---Look all you want, it's happening.
我到33岁再结婚就好012---So I don't have to get married until I'm 33.
我还有3年  3整年啊012---That's three years. That's three whole years.
不过  等一下012---Oh, wait a minute though.
我需要一年半来筹备婚礼012---I'll need a year and a half to plan the wedding.
我希望能认识这个人一年至一年半012---And I'd like to know the guy for like a year, year and a half...
再订婚012---...before we get engaged.
这表示我必须在30岁时认识这个人012---Which means I need to meet the guy by the time I'm 30.
没有问题  因为你才刚刚满012---Which is fine, because you just turned...
28岁012---...28.
不  罗斯  不  有问题012---No, Ross. No, it is not fine.
我应该和我要嫁的对象在一起了012---According to my plan, I should already be with the guy that I'm gonna marry.
你可不可以不要跳012---Will you quit hogging it'?
我告诉你  这就好像看着斑比学走路012---Oh, I'm telling you, it's like watching Bambi learn how to walk.
你醉了012---You're drunk.
爸和妈会生气012---Mom and Dad are gonna be mad.
也许我有一点醉了012---Maybe I'm a little drunk.
那是蟹饼吗012---Hey. Are those crab cakes?
我不是告诉你  蟹饼一出来立刻拿来给我012---Did I not tell you to come straight to me when more crab cakes were ready?
觉得怎么样012---How you feeling?
你好帅012---You are so handsome.
我想在此时此地和你上床012---I want to make love to you right here, right now.
我希望你不会012---I really wish that you wouldn't.
再撑一下  好吗012---All you have to do is just get through a little bit more, okay?
我们就可以带你去睡觉  只要微笑  不要说话012---Then we can put you in bed, okay? Just smile and don't talk to anyone.
演讲  演讲  寿星演讲012---Speech, speech. Let's hear from the birthday girl, huh?
菲比012---Pheebs.
看  大家都在看我012---Don't you see, everybody's looking at me.
我的计划很有效012---The plan's working.
我还没脱掉上衣呢012---I didn't even have to take off my top yet.
演讲  来吧  演讲012---Speech. Come on, speech.
来啊  演讲012---Come on. Speech.
钱德  你离开她一秒都不行012---Hey, Chandler, you can't keep your hands off her for one second.
这样好啊012---Oh, I think it's nice.
我必须这样012---I think it's necessary.
我要谢谢大家来到这里012---I wanna thank you all for coming.
我的家人和我的朋友012---My family and my friends.
我很想说我012---I'd really like to say that I'm, um...
知道我真的很想说什么吗012---You know what I'd really like to say?
我醉了012---I'm drunk.
没错  爸  妈012---That's right, Morn and Dad.
你们的小口琴醉了012---Your little "Harmomica" is hammered.
猜猜怎么着  我以前也喝醉过012---And guess what? I've been drunk before.
我抽过烟012---And I've smoked a cigarette.
你们知道吗  知道吗012---But you know what? You know what?
没关系  没关系  因为我今天满30岁了012---It's all okay. It's okay, because I turned 3O today.
我想做什么就做什么012---And I can do anything I want.
因为我是成年人了012---Because I am a grownup.
好  快  替我脱掉012---Okay, quick. Help me get this off. Yeah.
我失去了整整一年012---I lost a whole year.
真不能相信  真不公平012---I can't believe it. This is so unfair.
菲比  没有关系的012---Come on, Pheebs, it'll be okay.
是吗  是吗012---Will it? Will it?
如果你发现你变31岁了  你会怎么感觉012---How would you feel if you found out you were 31?
不会的  因为我们有个新约定012---That's not gonna happen, you know, because we have a new deal.
还有  这毁了我的时间表012---Plus, it totally ruined my schedule.
我还没做那些我31岁前想做的事012---I haven't done any of the things I wanted to do by the time I was 31.
像什么  像是012---Like what? Like, okay...
我还不认识任何葡萄牙人012---...I haven't met any Portuguese people.
我还没有完美地接吻过012---I haven't had the perfect kiss.
我还没去上狙击手学校012---And I haven't been to sniper school.
菲比  我们去吃蛋糕吧012---Phoebe, y'know why don't we go upstairs and have some birthday cake?
我只想一个人静一下  好吗  待会见012---No, I just feel like being by myself for a while, all right? I'll see you guys later.
谢谢012---Thanks.
可怜的菲比012---Oh, poor Pheebs.
嘿  知道吗  我想我应该陪她走回家012---Hey, you know what, you guys? I think I'm gonna go walk her home.
老天  怎么012---Oh, man. What?
他会吃了蛋糕012---He's gonna eat the cake.
菲比  等等012---Pheebs. Wait up.
听着  我012---Listen, I...
闭上眼睛012---Close your eyes.
你可以将这一项从单子上划掉012---Maybe that's one you can cross off your list.
哦  对了012---Oh, yeah. Heh.
还有  我是16分之1的葡萄牙人012---Oh, and plus, I'm one-sixteenth Portuguese.
好  大家都清楚了  我们要将它抬起来012---Okay, is everybody clear? We're gonna pick it up...
然后移动它012---...and move it.
只需要团队合作  懂吧  我们要抬起这台车012---All we need is teamwork, okay? We're gonna lift the car...
把它滑出来012---...and slide it out.
抬起来012---Lift...
滑出来012---...and slide.
罗斯   抬起来  我真的不觉得这  抬起来012---Ross, I really don't think this-Lift...
滑出来012---...and slide.
好  开始吧  大伙儿012---Okay, here we go. All right, everyone.
抬起来012---Lift...
移出来012---...and slide.
嘿  乔伊  别这样  瑞秋  才刚轮到我012---Hey, Joey-Oh, come on, Rach, my turn just started.
其实呢  我是要和泰格说话012---Actually, I just want to talk to Tag.
哦  好的  嘿  我可以到外面溜溜吗012---Oh, okay. Hey, can I ride this outside?
随便  我不是你妈012---Whatever, okay? I'm not your mother. Okay.
不要到街上012---Not in the street! Yeah.
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
有没有觉得好点  有  我很好  我012---How you doing, you feeling any better? Yeah, I'm doing okay. I'm, um...
我们谈谈012---Let's talk. Okay.
什么事012---Um... What's up?
秦格012---Uh, Tag, um...
你真是个好男人  我们在一起也很开心012---You're such a great guy, and we have so much fun together.
可是我  等下012---but I don't-I don't... Wait.
我知道你要做什么012---I think I see where you're going.
在你说任何话之前  我可以先说一件事吗012---But before you say anything else, can I just say one more thing?
说的好012---Well said.
正是我所谓很开心的好例子012---And a, uh, good example of the fun I was referring to.
但我想  我已经过了只要开心就好的时候了012---Uh, but, heh, I just think I'm past the point where I can, you know, just have fun.
瑞秋  不要这样  这只是因为你30岁了012---Rachel, don't do this. This is just because you're turning 30.
是的012---Yeah, it is.
而你还只是个孩子  你才25岁012---But you're just a kid. I mean, you're 25.
其实是24岁  老天012---Twenty-four, actually. Oh, God.
