嘿012---Hey.
怎么了  搭地铁时有人舔我的脖子012---What's the matter? Someone on the subway licked my neck!
舔我的脖子  威利还活着012---Licked my neck! Whoa! Willy's still alive.
你们在做什么   我妈打电话来012---What are you guys doing? My mom called.
他们要登报通知亲友  我们要订婚了012---They're gonna run our engagement announcement in the local paper.
我们想找张漂亮的合影   怕是不可能啊012---so we're looking for a good picture of us. Ooh, I'm afraid that does not exist.
我们合拍了很多不错的照片012---That's not true, There are great pictures of us.
不  你照得很好  但你旁边的男人是这样的012---No, there are great pictures of you standing next to a guy who's going like this...
天啊  他就是在自由女神像旁  跟你合照的怪胎012---Oh, my God, that's the creep that you're with at the Statue of Liberty.
我不知道这是怎么一回事   我就没办法好好照相012---I don't know what it is. I just can't take a good picture.
这一张很不错012---Oh, here's a great one.
对  那张没有我  没错  但我全身晒得黑亮012---Yeah, I'm not in that. No, I know, but look at me, all tan.
你们为什么不请专业摄影师  帮你们拍照呢012---Why don't you guys go, get portraits done by a professional photographer?
好点子   我敢说他们一定有大风扇012---That's a great idea. I bet they have one of those wind machines, Y'know.
那的确很棒  真的那么做的话  钱德应该看起来不会这么蠢012---Yeah, that's great. Next to that, Chandler won't look so stupid.
钱德  你觉得呢  没问题  但我得警告你012---Chandler, what do you say? All right, but I should warn you.
我不去   "我"会去012---I'm not going. I'm going.
老友记   第七季  第05集  订婚照012---Friends  S07E05  The One With The Engagement Picture
兄弟  那一记反手投篮帅呆了012---Dude, that reverse lay-up. Ugh!
那些三分球呢   太棒了012---And how about those three-pointers? Amazing.
这次也是就差这么一点   那些家伙就答应让我们上场了012---And those guys were this close to letting us play this time too.
你们看  菲比在跟咖啡厅帅哥说话012---Hey, look. Phoebe's talking to Cute Coffeehouse Guy.
你叫他 "咖啡厅帅哥"吗   我们叫他"边尿边哼歌先生"012---Oh, you guys call him "Cute Coffeehouse Guy"? We call him "Hums While He Pees."
对  我们叫罗斯  "厕所里逗留男"012---Yes, and we call Ross "Lingers in the Bathroom."
大伙们  "边尿边哼歌先生"   刚刚约我出去012---Hey, you guys, "Hums While He Pees" just asked me out.
我以为他结婚了  没错   但他正在办离婚012---I thought that guy was married. He is, but he's getting divorced.
罗斯  或许你认识他012---Ross, maybe you know him.
这又不是俱乐部012---It's not a club.
菲比  如果他正在办离婚   你觉得跟他约会适当吗012---Phoebe, If this guy's going through a divorce, is it such a good idea to start going out with him?
离婚男人又不是坏男人012---Hey, divorced men are not bad men.
他们把那句话印在俱乐部的纸巾上了012---They have that on the napkins at the club.
我得回去上班了  你还可以休息半小时012---Oh, I gotta get back to work. You don't have to be back for a half-hour.
但是我的助理泰格午餐时间里  会在办公室做仰卧起坐012---Yeah but, My assistant, Tag, does sit-ups in the office during lunch. Heh.
我真的快被他迷死了012---Ugh, I could just spread him on a cracker.
你在暗恋他  为什么还要雇用他012---Rach, if you have a crush on this guy, why would you hire him?
你知道你不能跟他约会  对吧  对啊  我知道012---I mean you know you can't date him, right? Oh, no, I know that.
我们开玩笑说  因为我们常常在一起012---Although we made a joke that we spend so much time together...
他应该叫我 "工作上的太太"012---...he should call me his "work-wife."
很快地  他就可以叫你 "那个被开除的女人"012---Soon he'll be able to call you "that lady he knew that got fired."
我不会被开除   因为我不会采取行动012---I'm not gonna get fired, because I'm not gonna act on it.
你不会介意   他跟别人约会吧012---So you wouldn't mind if he was dating someone else?
怎么了  他有吗  他有  对吧  他跟行销部那个荡妇约会012---Why, is he? He is, isn't he? He's dating that slut in marketing.
或许我该成立一个离婚男子俱乐部012---Maybe I should open a divorced men's club.
兄弟  那太惨了012---Dude, that's so sad.
我会在后院设一个篮球场012---I could put a basketball court in the back. Heh.
我能下场打球吗012---Could I play?
你今天不做仰卧起坐吗   泰格012---Oh, no sit-ups today, Tag?
我做完了   再给我做十下吧012---I just did them. Oh, well, drop and give me 1O more. Heh.

我午餐喝了酒   那些012---I had a drink with lunch. Did those, um--?
成本报告送过来了吗   我昨晚就已经归档了012---Did those cost reports come in? Yeah, I filled them out last night.
很好  麻烦你帮我复印四份012---Oh, great. Could you make me 4 copies of those?
没问题  太棒了  谢谢你012---Sure. Great, thank you.
嗨  端秋  嗨  梅丽莎  有什么事吗012---Hey, Rachel. Hi. Hi, Melissa. What's up?
我正好要出去血拼012---I'm just about to, urn, go out to the store.
想买些东西放进我的背包里012---to get some stuff to put in my backpack.
像水果干  速食麦片  那一类的东西012---You know, like dried fruit and granola, and stuff like that.
有什么事吗   秦格在吗012---Um, what's up? ls Tag here?
他不在  怎么了  我要来问他012---No. Why? Oh, I was gonna talk to him...
今晚要不要跟我出去  真的吗012---...about doing something tonight. Really?
你喜欢泰格  对吧012---You got a little crush on Tag there, do you?
我们一直都在眉目传情的012---Well, we've been flirting back and forth...
但我希望今晚   事情能有点进展012---...but I was hoping that tonight it would turn into something a little more than that.
别猴急  梅丽莎  这里不是更衣室012---Okay, whoa, whoa. Easy there, Melissa. This ain't a locker room, okay.
但我记得他说过   今晚他已经有约了012---But you know, I remember him saying that he had plans tonight.
不  没错012---Oh, no. Oh, yeah.
好吧  快回去工作012---Oh yeah. All right, back to work.
那不是泰格的背包吗012---Hey, isn't that Tag's backpack?
我不想当办公室里的臭女人012---Yeah, Melissa, I don't want to be known as the, uh, office bitch...
但我会打电话给你主管012---...but I will call your supervisor.
太棒了  非常不错  摩妮卡  很好012---Great, that's great, Monica. Great.
好了  钱德   你能笑一个吗012---Now, Chandler, you want to give us a smile?
好吧012---0Kay.
对不起  那张椅子很不舒服吗  不  是我很不舒服012---I'm sorry, is the seat uncomfortable? No, I am.
钱德  我知道你办得到   你笑起来很帅的012---Chandler, I know you can do this. Okay? You have a beautiful smile.
是吗  没错012---I do? Yeah.
或许你不必笑   我们来试试别的点子   试着012---All right, maybe you don't have to smile. Let's try something else. Let's try, um--
试着表现出性感的样子  好吧012---Try looking sexy. Okay.
还是不要吧012---Or not.
乔伊  你在这里做什么012---Hi, Joey, what are you doing here?
我要在附近试镜   结果酱汁沾到衣服上了012---I got an audition down the street, and I spilled sauce all over my shirt.
你有多余的衬衫吗  当然有012---You got an extra one? Yeah, sure. Um...
拿去吧012---Here.
太棒了012---Great.
你有除了罗夫罗兰外   其他品牌的衣服吗012---You got anything that's not Ralph Lauren?
应该没有  乔伊012---Yeah, I don't think so, Joe.
好吧  我猜这件应该可以012---All right, I guess this'll be fine.
你今晚要做什么   没事  怎么了012---Hey, Listen, uh, what are you doing tonight? Nothing. Why?
你要不要带我的助理泰格   出去玩012---How would you feel about taking out my assistant Tag?
我付钱012---I'll pay. Heh.
要我跟男人出去约会  可得付我一大笔钱012---Huh, Rach I got to say it's gonna take a lot of money for me to go out on a date with a dude.
我不是要你跟他约会012---I'm not asking you to go on a date with him.
真的吗   因为我真的很缺钱012---Really? Because I could kind of use the money.
乔伊  他刚搬到这里来  我知道他没有男性朋友012---Joey, just-He's new in town and he doesn't have any guy friends.
带他去看看球赛或做点别的事  我会非常感激你012---Just take him to a ball game or something. I'd appreciate it.
好的  没问题  谢谢你012---Yeah, okay, no problem. Thank you.
是甜甜圈012---Ooh, hey, doughnuts! Uh-huh.
我知道  我们来试试看012---I know. Let's try a look...
出神的表情012---...of far-off wonderment.
凝视我们的未来  想想我们的婚姻跟以后的日子012---Okay, we'll-we'll gaze into our future and we'll think about our marriage and the days to come.
钱德  你的脸到底是怎么了012---Chandler, what is the matter with your face?
这张照片应该要表达   "盖勒和宾府喜事"的012---I mean this picture's supposed to say "Geller and Bing to be married"...
不是"英勇女市民  救了快淹死的蠢蛋"012---...not "Local woman saves drowning moron."
嘿   别笑他012---Ha-ha-ha. Hey, don't laugh at him.
这个快淹死的蠢蛋是我的012---He's my drowning moron.
对了  就是这样  快拍下来012---Aw. That's it, that's it! Take it, take it!
我喜欢这一张012---I like this one.
它似乎是在说  "我爱你  所以我要杀了你"012---It seems to say, "I love you and that's why I have to kill you."
不会全部都那么糟糕啦012---They can't all be bad.
找那张你装出  睡眼朦胧的照片012---Find the one where you make your bedroom eyes.
我找到了012---Oh, there it is.
我的天啊   这就是我睡眼朦胧的样子012---Oh, my God, those are my bedroom eyes?
你为什么要跟我同床共枕012---Why did you ever sleep with me?
你真的想提这件事情吗012---Do you really want to pull at that thread?
我真的玩得很开心  我也是012---I'm having a really good time. Me too.
很抱歉地铁里那个家伙  舔了你的脖子012---Sorry that guy on the subway licked your neck.
不  没关系  他是朋友012---No, that's okay. He's a friend.
恕我放肆012---Uh, I don't mean to be presumptuous...
但我有明天国标舞总决赛的门票  如果你想去的话012---...but I have these two tickets to the ballroom-dancing finals tomorrow night if you want to go?
对  我012---Yeah, I--
我没有看准决赛  我想我看不懂012---Well y'know I-I mean I missed the semi-finals, so I think I would just be lost.
我知道那样真的很无聊   但这些票是我的老板012---Heh, I know that it's lame, but I got these tickets from my boss--
喔  不  我的天啊012---Oh, no, no, no, my God!
好了  别大惊小怪的   我去就是了  不012---Okay, don't freak out. I'll go. No, it's--
是我的前妻惠特妮012---My ex-wife Whitney is out there.
我现在没办法面对她   那个女人疯了012---I cannot deal with her now. That woman is crazy.
好吧  我知道  等一下012---Okay, I know. Hold on.
嘿   罗斯  什么事012---Hey, Ross. Yeah.
凯尔的前妻  惠特妮就在外面012---Yeah. Urn, that's Whitney, Kyle's ex-wife out there.
你可以把她诱开   让我们脱身吗012---Do you think that you can y'know divert her so that we can slip out?
什么  不012---What? No.
好吧  但我有两张国标舞总决赛的门票012---Okay, but I have two tickets to the ballroom-dance finals.
我想还是不要吧   菲比012---Look, I don't think so, Pheebs. I, heh--
好吧   我愿意012---All right, I'll do it.
但那只是因为你是我的朋友   好吧012---But just because you're a friend. Okay.
嗨  大舞王012---Hi, Ginger.
我要拿回我的钥匙012---All right! I want my key back.
我没拿  钥匙就那里012---I don't have it. It's right there.
好吧  大侦探福尔摩斯012---Ugh. Okay, Sherlock.
对不起  但你最好快点离开   菲比012---Look, I'm sorry, but you'd better go, Pheebs.
我只是要谢谢你   帮我们诱开凯尔的前妻012---All right. I just wanted to thank you though for diverting Kyle's ex.
别客气  待会再谈012---Oh, yeah, no, you're welcome. We'll, uh, talk about it later.
好012---Okay. Heh.
嗨  惠特妮   嗨   罗斯012---Hi, Whitney. Hi, Ross.
你准备好要去吃早餐了吗   是的012---Are you ready for breakfast? Yep. Ooh.
凯尔的前妻你应该要诱开她  不是跟她约会012---Kyle's ex-wife? You were supposed to divert her, not date her.
你能不能等我一下  我得跟这个女人谈一谈012---Sorry, can you give me a second while I talk to this woman...
顺便一提  她没有在这里过夜012---...uh, who, by the way, did not spend the night?
没问题   好吧012---Sure. Okay. Eh, heh...
我的确诱开她了  后来我们玩得很开心   好吗012---I did divert her, and we ended up having a great time, okay?
你们一起去看国标舞比赛   对啊012---Watching ballroom dancing? Yes.
那时我们发现  事实上我们俩都酷呆了012---That's where we realized we are both super cool people.
听着  罗斯  凯尔告诉我  她有些很差劲的缺点012---Look, okay, Ross. Kyle just told me some really bad stuff about her.
譬如说呢   譬如说她很无情012---Like what? Like she's really mean.
她喜欢吹毛求疵012---And she's overly critical and-And-No.
她会不经过你的同意   就把房间刷成很明亮的颜色012---She will paint a room a really bright color without even checking with you.
好吧012---0Kay.
她还会把性当成武器012---And she uses sex as a weapon.
谢谢你的警告012---Fine. Thank you for warning me.
早餐时我会注意   油漆跟性武器012---At breakfast, I'll be on full alert for room painting and sex weapons.
你还是要跟她约会  对012---You're still gonna go outwith her? Yeah.
你没有听到  刚刚我说的话吗012---Well, didn't you hear what I just said?
菲比  少来了  你的消息来源有问题012---Pheebs, come on. I mean, consider the source.
她的前夫当然会那么说   请你离开了啦012---Of course her ex-husband's gonna say that stuff. Now if you'll excuse me.
听我说   她疯了012---No, listen to me, she is crazy!
你的门没有隔音功能012---Uh, your door isn't sound proof.
看到了吧   她就是爱挑剔012---You see? Nothing is good enough for her.
早安  嗨  泰格012---Morning. Hi, Tag.
昨晚你跟乔伊玩得开心吗012---Hey, so did you have fun with, uh, Joey last night?
对  我们去看《尼克队》比赛012---Yeah, we went to the Knicks game.
真的太棒了012---Aw, that's nice.
然后我们去酒吧玩   他帮我们泡上好多女人012---Then we went to this bar, and he hooked us up with all these women.
女人  你是说老女人012---Women? You mean, like old women?
有点老  大概三十岁012---Kind of old, like 30.
是喔  我以前没办法012---Oh. And I never used to be able...
在酒吧里跟女人聊天012---...to just talk to girls in bars...
但昨晚我就拿到了  二十个电话号码012---...but I got, like, 20 phone numbers last night.
真的是太棒了012---That's great.
乔伊真的教会你一些事012---Oh, man. So Joey must have really taught you some stuff.
没错  是啊012---A little. Yeah.
你好吗012---How you doing?
看吧  那个笑容非常灿烂   轻松  自然012---See? That's a great smile. Easy, natural.
现在假装我手上拿了照相机012---Now pretend I have a camera.
你的笑容变了  我控制不了自己012---You're changing it. I can't help it.
好吧  你想知道  我都是怎么拍沙龙照的吗012---All right. all right, You want to know what I do when I take resume shots?
你跟我借钱012---Borrow money from me?
对  好吧  首先  你得装出自然的样子012---Yeah. Okay, first of all, you want to make it look spontaneous.
我都是这么做的  我会低头  低头  继续低头012---So here's what I do. I look down, look down, keep looking down.
然后抬头012---Then I look up.
看到没  现在你来试试看012---See? All right, now you try.
低头  低头  继续低头012---Look down. You're looking down. Keep looking down.
你的鞋子上为什么会有果酱012---Why is there jelly on your shoe?
我吃了甜甜圈   是喔012---I had a doughnut. Oh.
嗨  嘿012---Hi. Hey.
听说昨晚你跟泰格玩得很开心012---So, I heard you had some fun with Tag last night.
对  那家伙还不错012---Yeah, that guy's all right.
对  你很高兴教他怎么当 "乔伊"012---Yeah, and you had fun teaching him how to be all "Joey."
什么  你知道的  泡马子012---What? You know, all the women.
你没办法教别人怎么泡马子012---Hey well, You can't teach someone to be good with women.
所以我跟钱德出去  老是泡不到马子012---Y'know, That's why I never had any luck with Chandler.
我在这里啊012---I'm right here.
你能不能别再跟他一起出去了012---All right, Would you mind just not going outwith him again?
就是你跟他一起去泡马子012---Okay, just the idea of you and he and all these women--it's just
我知道他是我的助理   我不能跟他约会012---And I know he's my assistant, and I can't date him, blah!
但这真的让我很困扰   好吗012---but it just bothers me, all right?
不  你不能抢走他012---No, no, no, you can't take him away from me.
我终于找到一个  可以跟我一起去泡马子的拍档了012---I got a great partner to pick up girls with. Finally!
我还在这里啊012---I'm still right here.
至少你可以跟他谈一谈012---All right, will you at least talk to him...
告诉他跟一大堆女人约会   既空虚又得不到满足012---...and tell him how hollow and unsatisfying this dating-tons-of-women thing is?
什么012---What?
在我结束对他的暗恋之前  我不要他跟任何人约会012---I just don't want him to meet anybody until I'm over my crush.
我会忘记他的012---And I will get over it.
我并不爱他  那只是肉体上的吸引力012---It's not like I love him. It's just physical.
我常常这样暗恋男人   刚认识你时我就暗恋过你012---But—I mean I get these crushes all the time. Hell, I had a crush on you when I met you.
我知道  摩妮卡跟我说过012---I know. Monica told me.
我们刚认识时  你暗恋过我吗012---Did you have a crush on me when you first met me?
对  有啊012---Yeah, sure.
难道你们就是看不到我吗012---Can you people not see me?
你能跟他谈谈吗012---So will you talk to him?
我不知道  瑞秋  我会送你十件罗夫罗兰的衬衫012---I don't know, Rach. Oh, come on! I'll give you 10 Ralph Lauren shirts.
一件012---One.
不   十件   你说十件   你不能反悔012---No, 10. You said 10. You can't take that back.
嘿   你有事要跟我谈012---Hey Joey, You wanted to talk to me?
我不知道   你拿了东西来给我吗012---I don't know. You, uh, got something for me?
对  这是端秋要给你的012---Oh, yeah, this is from Rachel.
十件  好吧012---Ten. Okay.
泰格  跟太多女人约会下场是不好的012---Tag, there's such a thing as too many women.
真的吗   对你来说是的012---Really? Yeah, for you.
嘿   你来了  我来了012---Hey, there you are. There I am.
你没事吧   没事   乔伊说我需要放轻松012---You okay? Yeah, Joey said I, uh, needed to relax.
他给我吃抗组脐药012---So he gave me an antihistamine.
什么  对啊012---What? Yeah.
我搭地铁时睡着了  结果到了布鲁克林012---and then I fell asleep on the subway and went to Brooklyn.
布鲁克林好远012---Brooklyn is far.
你在想什么012---Chandler, What were you thinking?
我不知道  别担心  因为现在我知道要怎么拍照了012---I don't know, But don't worry, because I know how to take a picture now.
好了  看吧  低头012---Okay, see. Look down.
低头012---Look down.
低头012---Look down.
钱德  什么事012---Chandler? Yeah?
嗨  嗨012---Hi. Hi.
你跟疯婆子还好吧   她把你的兔子拿去煮了吗012---So how are things going with Crazy? Has she cooked your rabbit yet?
听着  你只听到片面之词  好吗012---Listen, you are hearing one side of the story. Okay?
还有  她拿了三十份   油漆样本给凯尔看012---and FYI, she must have shown Kyle over 30 paint samples...
之后才动手漆房间的012---...before she painted that room.
他对每一份样本的反应是  "我一点都不在乎"012---And his response to each one was, "I don't give a tiny rat's ass."
或许她该少花点时间在装修上012---Yeah well, maybe she should have spent a little less time decorating...
多花一点时间在卧室里012---...and a little more time in the bedroom.
我想我们不会有那样的问题吧012---Well, I don't think we are going to have that problem...
但或许那是因为  我不会吝于付出感情012---...but maybe that's just because I am not emotionally unavailable.
你认为他吝于付出感情012---You think he's emotionally unavailable?
我想有那个可能012---I think he can be.
如果她没有012---Well, Maybe he wouldn't be...
每晚把公事带回家做  或许他就不会那样子012---...if she didn't bring the office home every night.
你得原谅她   知道该怎么面对她的生活012---Well excuse her for knowing what she wants to do with her life.
她的确知道  她在1997年除夕做了什么012---Well, she certainly knew what she was doing New Year's Eve 1997.
我就知道你会那么说012---I knew you were gonna throw that in my face!
那是三年前的事  她一再地道歉012---That was three years ago. She apologized and apologized.
你还想怎么样012---What more do you want?
我们要找回六年的时光012---We want the last six years back!
我们也是  我们也是012---So do we! So do we!
很抱歉  让你们看到这一幕012---I'm sorry you had to see that.

说到在床上很自私   惠特妮还好吗012---And speaking of being selfish in bed, how's Whitney?
或许她不必在床上很自私012---Well maybe she wouldn't have to be selfish in bed...
如果另一个人知道  哪里是哪里012---...if someone else knew where everything was.

几乎谈了一整个晚上012---We talked most of the night...
我们明白  我们会这么气对方012---...and we realized the reason we're angry with each other...
是因为我们还对彼此有感觉012---...is because there are still feelings there.
所以012---So...
喔  快说吧  凯尔012---Oh, just say it, Kyle!
我们要再试一次012---We're gonna give it another try.
你不是说她爱抱怨   常常要人注意她吗012---What about her whining, and her constant need for attention?
我会努力调整自己012---I'm gonna work on that.
对  因为你很善变012---Oh, right, because you're so capable of change.
你知道的  他会边尿边哼歌012---You know, he hums when he pees.
我知道  所以他都尿不准   但那不重要012---I do know. Makes him miss the bowl, but whatever.
我们很抱歉012---We're so sorry.
没关系   我们不需要你们  我已经忘了这件事012---That's all right. We don't need you. I'm over it already.
对  我根本一点都不在乎012---Yeah, and I don't even give a tiny rat's ass.
我们得走了012---Yeah, we're gonna go.
对不起012---I'm sorry.
菲比  你没有看错她012---Pheebs, you were right about her.
她的确试图把性当成武器012---You know, she did try to use sex as a weapon.
我的背有一点痛012---Yeah, I hurt my back a little.
他做其他事时  也会哼歌012---You know, he hums while he does other stuff too.
没有他们  我们能过得更好012---We're better off without them. Heh.
就算他们再分手  千万别让他加入你的什么伤心男子俱乐部012---And y'know, Even if they break up again, you better not let him in your sad men's club.
是离婚男人俱乐部   有什么不一样呢012---Divorced men's club. Potato, "potato."
大家快来看012---Hey, guys, check it out.
我妈把报纸寄给我   我们来瞧瞧012---My morn sent me the paper. Ooh, let's see it. Yay.
