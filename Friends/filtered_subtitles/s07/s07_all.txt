她在那儿20分钟了  难道你没听到吗012---Yeah, She's been there for 2O minutes. I'm surprised you didn't hear her on the way over.
我还以为有个小孩在叫  "我是同性恋  我是同性恋"012---Oh, I thought it was a kid yelling, "I'm gay! I'm gay!"
可以带她进来了吗   让她去吧  好感人的012---Can I bring her in'? Oh no, Let her stay out there. It's sweet.
我要结婚了  我要做新娘了012---I'm getting married! I'm gonna be a bride!

你决定婚礼用的乐团了吗   我也能做音乐演出的012---So have you decided on a band for the wedding, because I'm kind of musical.
她几小时前才订的婚   我想她还没时间去想012---Yeah, honey, she just got engaged a couple of hours ago. I doubt she's had time to think about...
提到合奏  记得有人烧了我的房子吗012---Speaking of chiming in, remember the time you burned down my apartment?
是  你自求多福012---Yeah, you're on your own.
知道我们该怎么做吗  我们换衣服出门  去广场饭店喝香槟012---Y'know what we should do? We should all get dressed up and go have champagne at the Plaza.

要早起去试镜广告   精神状态必须要好012---I gotta get up early for a commercial audition tomorrow. I gotta look good.
我要演一个19岁的人012---I'm supposed to be playing a 19-year-old.
什么012---What?
你说要早起  是指1986年012---So when you said get up early, did you mean 1986?
你们不觉得我像19岁012---You guys don't think I look 19?
19   我们以为你说90012---Oh, 19! We thought you said 90.
好了  大伙儿  走吧012---Okay, everybody, let's go. Let's go! Okay.
我剩下的糖还在吗012---Hey, is uh the rest of my candy bar around here?
没了  你吃完了012---Oh honey no, you ate it all.
我就怕会这样012---I was afraid of that.
你知道什么样的鞋子  能配这只戒指012---You know what shoes would look great with this ring?
钻石鞋子012---Diamond shoes.
你还没换衣服012---You're not getting dressed.

要举行婚礼了012---There's gonna be a wedding.
你要做新娘了012---You're gonna be the bride.
有200人会看到你穿着白纱012---Two hundred people are gonna be looking at you in a clean, white dress.
来吧012---Let's do it.
钱德  很多人都会这样012---Chandler, it happens to lots of guys.
你累了  喝了太多香槟012---You're probably tired, you had a lot of champagne.
别担心012---Don't worry about it.
我不担心  我很惊讶012---I'm not worried. I'm fascinated.
知道吗  就像生物学一样012---You know? It's like biology.
很好笑   高中时我的生物不及格012---Which is funny, because in high school I failed biology...
今晚生物学报复我了012---...and tonight biology failed me.
你们听听这个  来宾进场时我要唱这首  好012---Check it out. Okay, I could play this while the guests are coming in, okay.
第一次见到钱德时   我以为他是同性恋012---First time I met Chandler I thought he was gay
但我现在  却在他的婚礼上唱歌012---But here I am singing On his wedding day
菲比  不要012---Phoebe, no.
如果让我唱完  后面会说他大概不是同性恋012---If you'd let me finish, it goes on to say that he's probably not gay.
当然  你们没有这个问题  你们是木头做的012---You guys don't have this problem, you're made of wood.
嘿  嘿   你看来很不错012---Hey, you look great. Hey.
谢谢012---Oh, thanks.
你还好吗012---You okay over there?
我也不知道  觉得有一点012---I don't know. You know? I feel a little...
你知道吗   没关系   我会没事的012---You know what? Never mind. I'll be fine.
别担心  你大概只是累了  喝了太多香槟012---Don't worry about it. You're probably tired, you had a lot of champagne.
每个人都会的012---It happens to everybody.
嘿   嗨012---Hey. Wow. Hi.
哇   摩妮卡之夜快乐   谢谢   你也样012---Happy Monica's Night. Well, thank you. You too.
你能相信吗   他们真的要结婚了012---Can you believe they are actually getting married?
是啊  我常常结婚012---Well, sure, but I get married all the time.
你还好吗  我想是吧012---You okay? Yeah, I guess.
你觉得我们会不会有那么一天012---I mean, do-do you think we'll ever have that?
你说 "我们"  是指你和我012---You mean "we," you and me?
不   不   不012---Oh, no, no, no.
"我们" 是指你和别人  我和别人012---"We," you with someone, me with someone.
还好  吓了我一跳012---Good, you scared me a minute.
是啊   好可怕012---I know. Shake it off.
因为我们俩在一起是噩梦012---It's just because you and I, we were like a nightmare.
可是  也有好时光  当然   就像那次012---No, but there were some good times. No, absolutely. Y'know like there was...
你总想得起一点好的吧   给我一分钟012---Surely you can think of something good. Just give me a minute.
对了012---Oh, well, yes.
我想得出一件好事  是什么012---I can think of one good thing. What?
你总是很012---You were always good at the...
在行012---...at the, uh, the stuff.
是啊012---Yeah, I...
我很在行012---I was good at the stuff huh?
对  我真的很喜欢你的手012---Uh-hmm, yeah, yeah,I really liked your hands.
我的手  对012---My hands? Yeah.
是吗012---Yeah? Uh-huh.
做得好  兄弟012---Way to go, guys.
你也有很多事很在行012---You were really good at the stuff too.
我知道012---Oh, I know.
嘿   你知道我们从没做过什么吗012---Hey, you know what we never did?
不  不是那个啦012---Oh, no, not that.
我们从没有过 "红利"夜012---We never had bonus night.
什么  "红利"夜012---A what? You know, bonus night.
就是两个人分手了  然后见面度过最后一夜012---Y'know, when two people break up, but they get back together for one night.
最后一夜   只是上床   没有其他的012---One night, just sex? No strings attached?
对   我们从来没有过012---Yeah, yeah, we never had that.
没有过012---No. No.
好  这有一点怪怪的感觉012---Okay, this is getting a little crazy.
我是说012---Um, I mean...
我相信那个一定会很棒的012---...I'm sure it would be amazing...
但我想   这不是个好主意012---but I...gotta say I really-really don't think it would be a good idea.
我真的012---Y'know? I really ...
真的012---...really...
不012---...don't.
怎么样012---‘Sup? 
怎么样   老兄012---Sup dude? 
要什么随便拿   不要伤害我012---Take whatever you want, just please don't hurt me.
你玩电动游戏吧   嗯012---You playing a little PlayStation, huh?
够酷012---That's wack.
打电动游戏够酷啊012---PlayStation is wack.
打电动游戏怎么样   如何啊012---‘Sup with the wack PlayStation,‘sup?!
嗯012---Huh?
怎么样   像不像19岁012---Come on, am I 19 or what?
对  从1到10来评分   10分是一个人看来最笨的样子012---Yes, on a scale of one to 10, 10 being the dumbest a person can look...
你绝对是19012---...you are definitely 19.
真的  多大012---Come on, really. How old?
很年轻   你是男人孩子   好吗012---Young. You're a man-child, okay?
去换衣服  大家都准备好了  拜托  内裤别还我012---Now get changed, because everybody's ready. And please, please, keep my underwear.
谢谢012---Oh, thanks. Okay.
乔   干嘛012---Joe. Yeah.
你和人上床很多次   对不对012---You've had a lot of sex, right?
何时  今天012---When, today?
有几次   但不多012---Some, not a lot.
我问你是因为我有一点012---Well, it's just the reason I'm asking is because I had kind of a, uh--
我不能012---I was unable to--
我很想  可是不能012---I mean I really wanted too, but I couldn't...
是这样012---There, ha, hm.
我发生了一个意外012---There was an incident.
不要担心   有时是会这样的012---Don't worry about that, man. That happens.
你也发生过   对啊   有一次012---It's happened to you? Yeah, once.
那你怎么办   照样做啊012---Well, what'd you do? I did it anyway.
菲比   快点   我们走吧012---Phoebe, come on, let's go.
快点012---Come on.
你为什么还没换衣服啊012---Why aren't you dressed yet?
抱歉  我替你的婚礼写出了最佳曲子012---I'm sorry, but I just wrote the best song for your wedding.
要不听听看  不  菲比012---Check this out. No. Phoeb.
如果你现在换好衣服  你就可以在婚礼演出012---I'll tell you what, If you get ready now, I'll let you play.
真的   对012---Really?! Yes.
太令人兴奋了  谢谢你  摩妮卡012---Oh that's so exciting! Thank you! Thanks, Mon.
可是如果你再动我的吉他  我就会打你012---Oh but Mon, if you touch my guitar again, I'll have to pound on you a little bit.
好吧  准备出门  我去叫大家012---Fair enough. now go get ready. Okay. I'll get everybody.
终于可以开始庆祝我的012---Finally we can start celebrating my--
对不起  显然   我打开了通往过去的门012---I'm sorry, apparently I opened the door to the past.
好   摩妮卡   你刚刚看到的是012---Okay, Monica, Mon. Okay, what you just saw--
可以问你一个小小问题吗   为什么要在今晚012---Can I ask you just a little question? Why tonight?
什么   我等了一辈子想着订婚012---What? See, I've been waiting my whole life to be engaged.
不像某些人  我只计划做一次012---And unlike some, I only plan on doing this once.
可能这个很自私  我很抱歉  但我希望这是今晚的焦点012---So, uh y'know, maybe it's selfish, I'm sorry about it, but I was kinda hoping tonight could just be about that.
甜心  这是今晚的焦点啊  不  这不是012---Oh, honey, but it is just about.. No, it's not.
不  不  不  现在焦点是你们的复合   什么012---No it’s not! No! No! Now it's about you and Ross getting back together. What?!
你看  你们抢了我的风头012---See yeah umm, you kind of stole my thunder.
好   等等   我们没有抢你的风头  我们并没有想要复合012---Okay! Ho-ho! We did not steal your thunder because we are not getting back together.
是啊  反正也没有人看到  没错012---Yeah, no, and nobody even saw. Yeah.
真的012---That's true.
我们只是吻了一下   只是一个吻012---Honey I swear it we just kissed. It was just a kiss.
你们吻了012---You guys kissed?
那是什么意思啊012---What does this mean?
你们复合了吗  我可以在你们婚礼上演唱吗012---Are you, are you back together? Can I sing at your wedding?
风头被抢了012---Thunder being stolen.
菲比  没有什么  莫尼卡  不要小事化大012---Okay come on Phoebe, it's nothing. Monica, come on! Let's not make a big deal out of this!
只发生一次   根本不算什么012---It was a one-time thing. It doesn't even matter.
我的天012---Oh, my God.
你们竟然在谈论这件事012---I cannot believe you guys are talking about this.
卧室里的问题是他们两个人之间的事012---Problems in the bedroom are between a man and woman.
好吗   钱德已经尽力了012---All right? Now, Chandler is doing the best he can.
我想他们不是在讨论这事  乔012---I don't think that's what they were talking about. Joe!!
真是个良夜啊   钱德不行了  他们却亲吻了012---What a great night. Chandler can't do it, they kissed.
什么   你们亲吻了  太大条了012---What? You guys kissed? This is huge.
不  这不算大条012---No-no, it's really not huge.
大家觉得这事大条不   让摩妮卡觉得012---People thinking it's huge has led Monica to believe...
我们抢了她的风头   但是我们没有012---...we're stealing her thunder, which we aren't.
可我们还在谈论这件事   不是吗012---We're still talking about it. aren't we?
那件事  还有钱德的问题012---That, and Chandler's problem.
摩妮卡  听着啊012---Monica, listen, listen.
如果我们不再谈罗斯和瑞秋   你会不会觉得好一点012---Would you feel better if we stopped talking about Ross and Rachel?
会很好  没问题012---That would be lovely. You got it.
来   我看起来可以像19岁吧012---Now, I can pass for 19, right?
对   你可以看起来像19岁012---Yes, you can pass for 19.
真的  对啊012---Really? Yes.
认真的   认真的012---Seriously? Seriously?
认真的说  不  你可以扮演你现在的年纪  也就是31岁012---Seriously, no. Okay? You can play your own age, which is 31.
我30岁012---I'm 30!
乔伊   不是   你31岁了012---Joey, you are not. You're 31.
真烂012---Oh, crap!
好  去广场饭店  叫些迈泰  不过你可能不能再喝了012---So, the Plaza. We'll get some mai tais? Maybe no more for you though.
我不想去广场饭店了012---You know, I-I think that umm, I don't feel like going to the Plaza.
为什么   摩妮卡  这太可笑了012---Why? Honey, Monica, this is ridiculous.
我不想谈这件事了   不想   尤其是和你012---I don't want to talk about it. I don't. Especially with you.
够酷012---Pssh. That is wack.
是吗012---Yeah?
好   我会在婚礼上唱这首歌012---Okay, I think I'll play it at the wedding.
好  不过要看他们  是不是真的让你演唱012---Yeah, well, we'll see if they actually let you play, huh?
他们会说你想听的话  像是  012---I mean they tell you anything you want to hear, like...
"你看起来像19岁"012--- "You look 19."
然后又反悔说  "不  你不像"012---Then they just take it away, like, "No, you don't."
这件事摩妮卡不会反悔的012---Well, I don't think Monica won't take this away.
她不会吗   难道她会吗012---Wouldn't she? Would she?
她会吗012---Would she?
你吃了我的糖果012---You ate my candy bar!
猜猜是谁012---Guess who.
嘿012---Hey.
我刚发现  我们似乎还有些事没解决012---Hey, I just realized we kind of left some stuff up in the air.
你认为摩妮卡说012---What do you think Monica mean when she said
"我不想谈" 特别是和我   是什么意思012---"I don't want to talk," especially with me?
为什么不特别是你和我   是我们两人在接吻012---I mean, Why not especially you and me? We were both out there kissing.
你还在想那件事吗012---Still thinking about it?
我是认真的  她说 "尤其是你" 什么意思012---I'm serious. What did she mean by that? "Especially you."
谁在乎啊  我在乎012---Oh, who cares? I care.
我也在乎012---And so do I.
我要和她谈谈   让我换件衣服好吗012---Y'know what, I have to talk to her. Will you let me just get changed?
好啊   没问题012---Okay, sure.
我要让你看我换衣服吗012---Am I going to let you watch me undress?
不012---No.
我不相信她竟然如此   她就是这样012---I can't believe her. It's just so typical.
摩妮卡  我知道你不高兴  可别忘了要举行婚礼了012---Now Monica, I know you're upset, but don't forget there is going to be a wedding.
你会去丢花   然后去蜜月012---You are going to throw the bouquet, and then a honeymoon.
可能去巴黎   巴黎012---Maybe in Paris. Paris?
我们会在月光下的   那叫什么来着的大道上散步012---We will take a moonlit walk on the Rue de la blah-blah-blah.
继续说012---Keep talking.
我们会在床上洒些玫瑰花瓣   然后做爱012---Then we will sprinkle rose petals on the bed and make love...
不是因为那样很浪漫   而是因为我能做到012---...not just because it's romantic, but because I can.
我爱你012---I love you.
别说话   你会把它吓跑的012---Okay, don't say anything, you might scare it away.
这是巴黎   谁知道我们在这里012---It's Paris. Who knows we're here?
菲比  什么事012---Hi, Pheebs. What's up?
你说我可以在你的婚礼上演唱   所以我要收订金012---You said I could sing at your wedding, so I need a small deposit.
什么  你知道  需要用一笔钱来预定那个日期012---What? Y'know, just some good faith money to hold the date.
我们不会给你订金012---We're not giving you a deposit for our wedding.
喔  我懂了012---Oh, I see.
他们真能伤你的心  不是吗012---They break your heart, don't they?
我不需要他们的同意012---You know, I don't really need their permission.
你想在他们婚礼上唱歌  就在他们婚礼上唱歌012---Yeah! if you wanna sing at their wedding, well you sing at their wedding.
如果你想看起来像19岁  就要012---Yeah, and if you want to look 19, then you--
你要修饰一下你的眼睛012---You got to do something about your eyes.
怎么   我的眼睛怎么了012---What?! What's wrong with my eyes?
他们出卖了你   出卖了里面太多的智慧012---They give you away. There's just-there's just too much wisdom in there.
在上面放茶袋敷15分钟012---Just put some tea bags on them for 15 minutes.
这个也会去除我的智慧  也许你只需要10分钟012---That'll get rid of my wisdom? Maybe 10 minutes for you.
给她订金  给她戒指   我不在乎012---Oh, give her the deposit, give her the ring. I don't care.
什么事   摩妮卡  你是什么意思  你说012---Yes? Monica, What did you mean when you said...
你不想和任何人谈  尤其是我012---...you didn't want to talk to anyone, especially me?
好棒的道歉  你接受了  再见012---What a great apology. And you accept it. Bye-bye.
不  我是认真的 "特别是和我"  是怎么回事012---No-no, seriously-seriously, what was the "especially me" part about?
这样说吧   这不是你第一次抢了我的风头012---Well, let's just say it's not the first time you've stolen my thunder.
什么012---Wham'?
我觉得012---Hey, here's a thought...
摩妮卡  你在说什么啊012---Monica, what are you talking about?
我16岁的生日宴会上  记得你和我表哥查理上三垒012---My sweet 16. Remember, you went to third base with my cousin Charlie.
啊  上三垒012---Ah, third base.
每个人都在讲那件事012---It was all everybody at the party could talk about.
摩妮卡  那会儿发生是因为你的宴会太无聊了012---Monica, y'know what? The only reason I did that was because your party was so boring.
我们请了一个漫画家012---We had a caricaturist. Oh.
当我结婚时  猜猜不会请谁来演唱012---Whenever I get married Guess who won't be asked to sing
叫盖勒的还有叫宾的012---Somebody named Geller And somebody else named Bing
摩妮卡  你的甜蜜16岁生日就像是一百万年前的事了012---Monica, your sweet 16 was like a million years ago.
而你现在又再做了一次012---And yet, here we are doing it again.
我不想抢你的所谓的风头012---Ugh, Monica I don't want to steal your stupid thunder.
那还有什么原因   你会和罗斯亲热012---Why else would you have made out with Ross?
我不知道012---Got me.
够了啦   时机已过  不会发生了012---All right, easy mimey, the moment has passed. It ain't gonna happen.
如果今晚的注意力都在我身上就好了012---I just thought it would be nice if I could have this one night.
我发誓  我从没有想要过抢你的风头012---I swear, I never wanted any part of your night.
不应该有人看到我们接吻的012---No one was supposed to see us kissing.
所以你们就在秘密走廊上做吧  因为没有人会到那儿去012---Oh, is that why you did it the secret hallway where nobody ever goes?!
瑞秋  我想过了012---Uh, Rachel, I've been thinking.
我觉得我们今晚在一起的主意不是很好012---I don't think us getting together tonight is such a good idea.
我想退出了012---I'm calling it off.
真是挽救尊严的好方法啊012---Way to save your dignity, my man.
摩妮卡  我为什么要抢走属于你的晚上012---Mon, why, why would I ever want to take away from your night?
我不知道  也许你有一点生气012---I don't know, maybe you feel a little resentful.
也许你以为你会先结婚012---Maybe you thought you'd get married first.
也许你不能忍耐012---Maybe you can't stand...
你那个以前很胖的朋友会先结婚012---...that your formerly fat friend is getting married first.
哦  你知道吗  太不公平了012---Oh, wow, that-You know what? That is so unfair.
知道吗  现在我想抢你风头了012---Y'know what? Now I want to steal your thunder.
罗斯  走  我们做爱去012---Come on, Ross. Let's go have sex!
不敢相信  你们竟然在我的订婚之夜做爱012---I can't believe you're gonna have sex on my engagement night.
总得有人做啊012---Well, somebody should.
如果我们要做012---Look, if we're gonna do this--
我们不能做  只是让她以为我们有做过012---We're not gonna do this, all right? She's just gonna think that we're doin’it.
我懂了  人人都是赢家012---I see, so everybody wins.
谁  是摩妮卡  开门012---Who is it? It's Monica, open up.
罗斯  停一下  拜托   等一下012---Okay, Ross, stop it. Please, wait a minute.
宝贝  你喜欢吗012---Yeah, you like that, baby?
有什么事吗012---May we help you?
我要告诉你  我希望你们能上床  希望你们复合012---I just wanted to say I hope you do have sex tonight and I hope you get back together.
但我警告你啊   你宣布订婚的那一晚012---but I must warn you, the night you announce your engagement...
我会宣布我怀孕了012---...I'm going to announce that I'm pregnant.
那怎么可能呢012---How is that ever going to happen?
摩妮卡  你想知道今晚   我为什么会和罗斯在一起012---All right Monica, do you want to know why I was with Ross tonight?
我知道为什么   你不知道012---I know why. You don't.
好  为什么   因为我很伤心012---Okay, why? Because! Because I was sad.
什么意思012---What do you mean?
听着  我很012---Look, I am so...
很为你们高兴012---...so happy for you guys.
但你要结婚这件事   提醒了我   我没有012---But you getting married just reminds me of the fact that I'm not.
八字都没一撇012---I'm not even close.
也许我只想让自己好过一点012---And I don't know, maybe I just wanted to make myself feel better.
我知道这很笨  可是罗斯结婚时012---I know that that's dumb, but you were so depressed...
你沮丧得和钱德上床012---...when Ross got married, you slept with Chandler.
我无所谓   和她上床的是我012---I don't care, she slept with me.
甜心  很抱歉   毁了属于你的今晚012---Anyway, sweetie, I am so sorry I ruined your night.
我很抱歉   我几乎让你和罗斯上床012---I'm sorry I almost made you sleep with Ross.
我要走了012---I'm gonna take off.
恭喜  谢谢012---Congratulations, man. Thanks.
瑞秋  什么012---And Rachel. Yeah.
我能说什么呢012---What can I say?
你失去了你的机会012---You missed your chance.
从现在起  只有我能享受他们了012---From now on, the only person who's going to enjoy these bad boys is me.
我们以为菲比会离开012---We thought Phoebe would leave
但她留了下来012---But she just stayed and stayed
没错  我整夜留在这里012---That's right, I'm here all night
钱德永远不会012---And Chandler will never get--
来  这儿是一块钱012---Hey, here's a dollar.
算是订金   请在我婚礼上演唱012---Consider it a deposit. Please sing at our wedding.
哦  谢谢  好012---Oh, thank you. Okay.
现在谁会在婚礼表演012---Now who will perform the ceremony?
谁会在婚012---Who will perform the cer--?
我早上再来打他012---I'll pound on him in the morning.
嘿  谁要法国吐司  给我一点012---Hey. Who wants French toast? Oh, I'll have some.
我也要  牛奶和鸡蛋在冰箱里   谢谢012---Me too. Eggs and milk in the fridge. Thanks.
怎么回事   甜心  不知道  我的手怪怪的012---Oh, what's the matter, honey? I don't know, My hand feels weird.
我猜因为  我已经订婚了012---I guess it's because I'm engaged.
什么时候会开始变得烦人了   已经开始了012---How long before it starts getting annoying? It starts?
开始计划婚礼吧012---Yeah, so let's actually get started on the wedding plans.
好  现在就开始012---Okay. Already?
有很多事要做   要想花012---Yeah, we got a lot to do. We gotta think about the flowers...
外烩  音乐012---...the caterers, the music...
我觉得音乐的安排   钱德  太多意见了012---Oh, I got some thoughts on the music... Oh wait Chandler, too many cooks...
给你良心的建议  你只需要出现  说对名字就好了012---Take it from me. All you have to do is show up and try to say the right name.
好012---0Kay.
那是什么  老天  是婚礼计划书012---What in God's name is that? Oh, my God, the wedding book?
四年级后我就没看到它了012---I haven't seen that since the 4th grade.
这里面什么都有  比如说  地点012---This baby has got everything. Take, you know, locations for instance:
先以字母顺序排列   再以地理位置排列012---First organized alphabetically, then geographically...
然后以大小排列012---...then by square footage.
好聪明012---That is so smart. Ha.
快溜   快溜   就趁现在012---Break it off. Ahem. Break it off, now.
老友记   第七季  第2集  瑞秋的色情小说012---Friends  S07E02  The One With Rachel's Book
所以以上证明了012---And that should conclusively prove...
《侏罗纪公园》是我先想到的012---...that I had the idea for Jurassic Park first.
我们来看看  罗斯012---Now, let's take a look-Hey, Ross.
菲比  我的天啊  你来干什么012---Phoebe, oh, my God, what are you doing here?
我有事和你说  很紧急  有关摩妮卡和钱德012---I need to talk to you. It's pretty urgent. It's about Monica and Chandler.
我的天   当然012---Oh, my God. Um, of course.
等我一下012---Uh, would you please excuse me for a moment?
你们知道彼此从哪儿来的吗   何不012---Um, heh, do you know each other's hometowns? Why don't you...?
怎么回事012---What's going on?
没什么  我在想  既然他们刚订婚012---Well, urn, not much. But, I was just thinking that since those guys just got engaged...
应该多给他们一些独处的时间012---...that maybe it'd be nice if they had some privacy.y'know?
所以   我可以搬到你家待几天吗012---So, could I just move in with you for a couple days?
好  当然可以  摩妮卡和钱德发生了什么事吗012---Okay, yeah, sure. But what's wrong with Monica and Chandler?
没事  怎么了012---Nothing. Why?
菲比  是你说很紧急的012---Phoebe, you said it was urgent.
是啊  我的电影5分钟后要开演了012---Oh, yeah, it is. I'm going to the movies and it starts in like five minutes.
你知道  我有一屋子的学生在这儿吗012---Do you realize I have a classroom full of students?
抱歉  我没礼貌  有人想要一起去看电影吗012---Oh, I'm sorry. I'm so rude. Does anyone want to come to the movies?
我还没和我爸妈谈到预算012---I haven't cleared the budget with my parents yet...
不过可以跟我说音乐部分的安排012---...but tell me how this is for music.
这样好不好  行进时用弦乐四重奏  鸡尾酒会时安排爵士三重奏012---All right, urn, a string quartet for the processional, a jazz trio for cocktails...
跳舞时用湾市摇滚012---...the Bay City Rollers for dancing...
等一下  那是我的六年级婚礼012---Wait, that was for my 6th grade wedding.
也不可能用他们  伊恩不演出了  德苗克012---Well, you couldn't get them anyway. Ian doesn't play anymore, and Derek...
我不该知道德苗克这个人的012---Well, Derek is a name I shouldn't know.
摩妮卡  有没有别的枕头  比较舒服一点的012---Hey, Mon, do you have another pillow, you know, something a little snugglier?
你为什么不回你家去   却要在这里睡012---Why are you napping over here instead of over at your place?
因为鸭子  什么  鸭子012---The duck. What, the duck?
怎么了   现在鸭子又做什么了012---What the hell did the damn duck do now?
它不是在那里生病的012---Uh, well, he did not get sick somewhere in there...
立刻就被发现了   而且处理干净了012---...and it was immediately found and properly cleaned up.
我可以看这本书吗012---Now, do I get to look at this book...
还是只有和婚礼相关人员可以看012---...or is it just for people who are actually involved in the wedding?
你当然可以看   我要你的意见012---Of course you can look at it. Yeah, I want your opinion too.
来012---Okay. Here you go.
桌子中间的花饰   花饰012---What do you think about centerpieces? Centerpieces.
玫瑰还是百合  当然是玫瑰了012---Roses or lilies? Definitely roses.
我觉得它们比较像婚礼的用花012---Well, I just think they're a bit more wedding-y, you know.
但是很清楚应该选百合  老天  简直就是心有灵犀012---But lilies are the clear choice. Oh, my God, it's like one mind.
各位  各位  让我休息好不好012---Guys, guys, you gotta let me nap.
不然我会脾气不好012---I'm gonna get cranky.
乔伊  走廊对面的沙发很好的012---Joey, there is a perfectly good couch across the hall.
是的  很不错012---Yes, it is perfectly good...
但那不是鸭子生病的地方之一012---...and it is not one of the places the duck got sick.
什么012---What?
好  我要走了  乔伊   鸭子到底做了什么012---All right, I'm gonna go. Joey, what did the duck do?
我不知道  但他没吃你的面霜012---I don't know, but he did not eat your face cream.
小朋友012---Hey, little buddy.
你觉得如何012---How you feeling? Aah.
那面霜里到底有什么012---What the hell is in that face cream?
好软012---That's so soft.
有枕头套啊012---Pillowcases.
嗯012---Oh, ah.
柔达看着扫烟囱的人  她的父亲是个传道者012---"Zelda looked at the chimney sweep. Her father, the vicar--"
传道者012---Vicar?
还有好几小时才会回来012---"--wouldn't be home for hours.
她欲火中烧012---Her loins were burning.
她不顾一切伸出手去抓住他的012---She threw caution to the wind and reached out and grabbed his--"
哇012---Whoa.
哇012---Whoa.
这是色情小说012---This is a dirty book.
菲比012---Uh, Phoebe?
嗨  罗斯012---Oh, Ross, hi.
菲比  你在干什么  抱歉  我有客人在012---Phoebe, what are you doing? I'm sorry, I'm with a client right now.
菲比  好吧  我们到外面谈012---Phoebe. Okay, let's talk outside.
菲比  你不能在我家帮别人按摩啊012---Phoebe, you can't massage people in my apartment.
有什么大不了的   我在摩妮卡和钱德家都可以012---What's the big deal? I did it at Monica and Chandler's.
他们知道吗012---And they knew about it?
好吧   罗斯  到底怎么回事012---Okay, look, Ross, what is this really about?
这是我家   我希望能自由出入012---Look, this is my home, and I want to be able to come and go whenever I want.
好吧   我会找个其他地方  给我剩下的客人做的012---Okay. I will find someplace else to do the rest of my appointments.
我只是觉得   这有什么大不了的012---I just don't know what the big deal is.
大不了的地方就是  当我想回家拿一瓶拼图啤酒  冰啤酒放松时012---The big deal is I don't want naked, greasy strangers in my apartment...
我不要光着身子  身上油油的陌生人在我家里012---...when I want to kick back with a puzzle-Beer, cold beer.
嘿  乔伊  你好吗012---Hey, Joey. What are you doing?
扫地  怎么了  挑起你的性趣了吗012---Sweeping. Why? Does it turn you on?
不会012---No.
如果我扫的是烟囱呢012---What if I was, uh, sweeping a chimney?
乔伊   你吃了我的面霜了吗012---Joey, did you eat my face cream?
你去哪儿  传道者还要几小时后才会回来012---Where are you going? The vicar won't be home for hours.
乔伊012---Joey...
你从哪儿学到那个词的012---...where did you learn that word?
你想是哪里012---Where do you think...
柔达012---...Zelda?
你看了我的书   对012---You found my book? Yeah, I did.
乔伊  你到我房里干什么012---Joey, what are you doing going into my bedroom?
抱歉  我只是小睡了一下012---Okay, I'm sorry. I went in there to take a nap.
我知道  我不应该看  可是你居然有色情小说012---And I know I shouldn't have, but you got porn.
知道吗  我不在乎  我不会感到有什么丢脸的012---Hey-hey, You know what? I don't care. I'm not ashamed of my book.
女人享受一点情色没什么不对啊012---There's nothing wrong with a woman enjoying a little erotica.
是女性性成熟的健康表现012---It's just a healthy expression of female sexuality...
那是你永远都不会理解的012---...which, by the way, is something that you will never understand.
你有色情小说012---You got porn.
你好  嗨   菲比在吗012---Hello. Hi, is, uh, Phoebe here?
不   不   今晚她不在  真是的012---Uh, no, no, she's out for the night. Oh, great.
可以帮你什么忙吗012---Heh. Can I help you with something?
我不知道   你是按摩师吗012---I don't know. Are you a masseur?
是   我是012---Yes, I am.
太好了  爸012---Great. Dad?
谢谢你   一小时后我来接他012---Thank you so much. I'll be back to pick him up in an hour.
钱德  你父母听到你订婚的消息012---So, Chandler, your parents must've been thrilled...
一定会很开心的012---...when you told them you were engaged.
哦   是啊   我应该打电话给他们012---Oh, yeah. I should probably call them.
我记得我们刚订婚的时候012---I remember when we first got engaged.
我没听过这个故事  爸  你不必012---I don't think I've heard that story. Dad, really you don't--
是啊  我让茱蒂怀孕了012---Well, I'd gotten Judy pregnant.
我还是不知道怎么发生的012---I still don't know that happened.
你不知道怎么发生的  你的狗还以为我的避孕器是磨牙的玩具012---You don't know how that happened?! Your dog thought my diaphragm was a chew toy.
好感人的故事012---What a sweet story.
至少你不是在五年级的万圣节派对上听到的这故事012---At least you're not hearing it at your 5th grade Halloween party.
什么  他们要听吓人的故事012---What? They wanted a scary story.
提起婚礼计划  我们好兴奋啊012---Anyway, we're really excited about our wedding plans.
很快我们就要能从婚礼基金中提取一大笔钱了012---and well I guess pretty soon we'll be making a big withdrawal from the Monica wedding fund.
什么  杰克  你告诉她  我做不到012---What? You tell her, Jack. I can't do it.
怎么了  我的婚礼基金还在   对吧012---What happened? You still have the Monica wedding fund, don't you?
还在  只是现在叫做  "海滩别墅"012---We have it. Only now we call it "the beach house."
我不敢相信  你把我的婚礼基金花在了海滩别墅上012---I can't believe you spent my wedding fund on the beach house.
对不起  我们以为012---We're sorry honey, but we just assumed...
等你30岁后  你会自己付钱012---...if you got married after you turned 30 you'd pay for it yourself.
你们买海滩别墅时我才23岁012---You bought the beach house when I was 23.
那也就是   你在海边享受了7年好时光012---Which means you had seven years of beach fun...
那可是无价的012---...and you can't put a price on that, sweetie.
我们觉得很抱歉012---We really do feel bad about this though.
你和理查交往时   我们又开始存钱012---We started saving again when you dated Richard.
结果你们闹翻了  我们重新装修了厨房012---But then that went to hell, so we redid the kitchen.
那我开始和钱德约会呢012---What about when I started dating Chandler?
我们以为钱德不会求婚012---Well it was Chandler! We didn't think he'd ever propose.
很显然  开始吃饭时   我的酒喝得不够012---Clearly I did not start drinking enough at the start of the meal. Heh.
我不相信   我结婚竟然没有钱了012---I can't believe there is no money for my wedding.
也许还有   如果你爸没有012---We might still have some if your father didn't think it was a good idea...
在网络上卖冰的话012---...to sell ice over the Internet.
那个主意看来很简单   只能用 "笨"来形容012---It seemed like such a simple idea. Stupid, Jack. The word is stupid.
够了  我不想再听了012---All right, enough. I don't want to hear about it anymore.
祝你好运   钱德012---Good luck, Chandler.
现在我要012---Okay, now I'm going to...
碰你了012---...touch you.
好软啊012---Oh, that's soft.
我不敢相信   你认为你的父母可能帮忙付吗012---I can't believe this. Do you think your parents could help pay for it?
我不知道012---I don't know.
我妈大部分的钱   都花在她第四次的婚礼上了012---My mother spent most of her money on her fourth wedding.
剩下的钱她离婚还要用012---She's saving the rest for her divorce.
而我爸存的钱用在到桃利屋的012---And any extra cash my father has, he saves for his yearly trips to...
年度旅行了012---...Dollywood.
你们的晚餐发生什么事了012---What happened at dinner?
我父母把婚礼基金花掉了012---My parents spent the money for our wedding.
我的天   你点了什么菜012---My God, what did you order?
等一下   没有婚礼基金了  太惨了012---Wait, there's no money? Well, this is terrible.
你们必须在活动中心结婚了012---You guys are gonna have to get married in, like, a rec center.
亲爱的  没关系的  不  有关系012---Honey, it's gonna be okay. No, it's not gonna be okay. It sucks.
没有乐团   没有百合   不   可那样很好啊012---No swing band, no lilies. No, you know what? It's gonna be okay.
你不需要有这种012---I mean, you don't need to have this...
意大利野宴012---...rustic Italian feast, you know?
你不需要这种订做的帝国式腰线  公主型丝缎礼服012---And you don't need this custom-made empire-waisted, duchess satin gown.
你可以买现成的礼服012---You can wear off-the-rack.
真的  不会有问题的012---Look, it really is gonna be okay.
重要的是我们彼此相爱   要结婚了012---The important thing is that we love each other and we're gonna get married.
你知不知道 "现成的"是什么意思012---Do you even understand what "off-the-rack" means?
你为什么不自己付钱呢012---Why don't you just pay for it yourself?
怎么付   我没钱啊012---How? I don't have any money.
我有啊   要多少012---Well, I have some. How much?
将近有012---Well, close to...
哇   你开玩笑   到底多少012---Whoa! Are you kidding me? What? How much?
够办婚礼计划A  真的012---It's enough for wedding scenario A. Really?
你真好  努力存钱的人012---How great are you, you little saver? Heh.
正是理想婚礼的预算012---The amount you have is exactly the budget of my dream wedding.
喔   你们真是天造地设的一对012---Oh, you guys are so made for each other.
你不是要把所有的钱都花在婚礼上吧012---Well, you're not suggesting that we spend all of the money on the wedding?
是啊012---Uh,yeah.
我花了六年存到这些012---Well, I've been saving this money for six years...
有些是将来要用的  不是都花在一场派对上的012---...and I kind of have some of it earmarked for the future, not just for a party.
哇   钱德先生   你好啊012---Wow. Hello, Mr. Chandler.
这是我们一生中最重要的一天012---this is the most special day of our lives.
我知道  甜心  但我不要把钱都花在一场派对上012---I realize that, honey, but I'm not gonna spend all the money on one party.
甜心  我爱你012---Honey, um, I love you. Heh.
但如果你再叫我们的婚礼是一场派对的话012---But, urn, if you call our wedding a party one more time...
你将可能不会被邀请012---...you may not get invited.
钱可以再赚   但我们只结婚一次012---We can always earn more money, okay? But we're only gonna get married once.
我了解   但我是非常坚决地   我的答案是不012---Look, I understand, but I have to put my foot down, okay? The answer is no.
你很坚决012---You're gonna have to put your foot down?
对  我是012---Yes, I am.
有钱和有一只坚定的手012---Wow. Money and a firm hand.
终于是我可以认同的钱德了012---Finally a Chandler I can get on board with.
嘿   瑞秋   乔伊012---Hey,Rach. Joey.
瑞秋  有没有闻到烟味012---Hey, Rach, do you smell smoke?
我懂了  烟   烟囱  扫烟囱的人   很好笑012---Uh-huh. I get it. Smoke, chimney, chimney sweep. Very funny. Ha, ha.
不  不  我说真的  你没闻到012---No, no, no, I'm serious. You don't smell it?
有东西着火了012---Something's on fire.
我没闻到什么012---No, I don't smell anything.
你知道吗  可能是你熊熊的欲火012---Oh, you know what? It's probably just your burning loins.
你们在讲什么啊   没什么012---Hey, what are you guys talking about? Nothing.
讨厌   咖啡冷了012---Mm, damn, this coffee's cold.
瑞秋  可以在你身上加温一下吗012---Hey, Rach, do you mind if I heat this up on your loins?
乔伊   你竟然告诉他012---You know, I cannot believe you told him. Joey...
我猜你是在我们分手后买了那本书的012---So I guess you bought that book after we broke up, huh?
是啊   因为第一本  在我们交往时被翻烂了012---Uh-huh, I did, because I wore out my first copy when I was with you.
是吗012---Oh, yeah? Yeah?
我们交往时  我看了一大堆色情杂志012---Well, uh, when we were going out, I read tons of porno magazines.
怎么样012---What's up?
罗斯  你怎么可以那样对待一位老先生012---Ross, how could you do that to an old man?
失陪了  小姐们012---Excuse me, ladies.
什么啊012---I'm sorry?
我的按摩客人   亚瑟012---My massage client, Arthur.
他女儿说替我工作的一个人012---His daughter called and said some guy that worked for me...
今天下午替他做了个很奇怪的按摩012---...gave him a really weird massage this afternoon.
我做了很专业的按摩012---I gave him an extremely professional massage.
他说你用木汤匙戳他012---He said you poked at him with wooden spoons.
好吧   不是传统的按摩012---Okay, so it wasn't a traditional massage.
可是我用筷子替他刺激穴道012---But I did give him acupressure with a pair of chopsticks...
并且温和地用拖把去角质012---...and I gently exfoliated him with a mop.
他再也不会来了  你害的我一星期少进帐80元012---Well, he's never coming back, okay? You just cost me $80 a week.
这是你的错   你没更改约他的时间012---You know what? This is your fault. You didn't move his appointment.
我的错  你不必替他按摩的012---Oh, it's my fault? You didn't have to massage him.
你可以请他回去的012---You could've sent him away.
也你不必用玩具推土机   在他背上滚来滚去012---You could've not rolled Tonka trucks up and down his back.
他说他很喜欢012---He said he liked that.
你对  你对  对不起012---You're right, you're right. I'm sorry.
老兄  你干嘛按摩一位老先生012---Dude, what are you massaging an old man for?
他女儿很辣   懂了012---His daughter was hot. Gotcha.
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey
听着012---Listen, urn...
我想过了012---...I've been thinking.
要你把所有的钱   花在婚礼上很不公平012---And it's not fair for me to ask you to spend all your money on our wedding.
你辛苦赚来的012---I mean, you work really hard for that.
嗯  是你赚来的012---Well. Well, you work for that.
我也想过了012---Look, I thought about it too.
对不起   我们应该把所有的钱花在婚礼的012---And I'm sorry. I think we should spend all of the money on the wedding.
真的  对  我很坚决的012---You do? Yeah, I'm putting my foot down.
我向你求婚时  我就告诉你了012---Yeah, look, when I proposed, I told you...
我会尽力让你快乐012---...that I would do anything to make you happy.
如果办一场完美婚礼能让你开心012---And if having the perfect wedding makes you happy...
那我们就这么做012---...then that's what we're gonna do.
你对我真好012---You are so sweet.
不  等等012---Oh, but wait.
那我们  未来的生活该怎么办啊012---What about our--? What about the future and stuff?
管他的呢012---Ah, forget about the future and stuff.
我们只生两个就好012---So we only have two kids.
选一个我们最喜欢的   让他去念大学012---You know, we'll pick our favorite and that one will get to go to college.
你真想过这些   对啊012---Have you thought about that? Yeah.
你本来要几个孩子012---How many kids were we gonna have?
四个  一个男孩  一对双胞胎女孩  再一个男孩012---Uh, four. A boy, twin girls and another boy.
你还想过什么012---What else did you think about?
还有我们要住的地方012---Well, heh, stuff like where we'd live, you know.
像是在市中心外的小房子012---y'know? Like a small place outside the city...
我们的小孩可以学骑单车012---...where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff.
可以买只猫咪   脖子上挂着铃铛012---Y'know, we could have a cat that had a bell on its collar...
每次它跑出小门时   都听得见铃声012---...and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door.
在车库上盖个房间   让乔伊终老012---Of course we'd have an apartment over the garage where Joey could grow old.
你知道吗012---You know what?
我不要一个盛大的婚礼012---I don't want a big, fancy wedding.
你应该要的  不012---Sure you do. No.
我要你刚刚说的每一样东西   我要一个婚姻012---I want everything that you've just said. I want a marriage.
你确定012---You sure? Mm-hm.
我好爱你  我爱你012---I love you so much. I love you.
你刚说到将来的时候   你说喵咪012---Hey, listen, when you were talking about our future, you said cat.
实际上你指的是狗   对不对012---But you meant dog, right? Ha, ha.
对  好012---Ha, yeah, totally. Oh, good.
你好   柔达012---Hello, Zelda.
你又是谁呢   传道者012---Who are you supposed to be? The vicar.
你知道传道者是什么吗  像是个守门员  对不对012---Do you even know what a vicar is? Like a goalie, right?
对012---Yeah.
乔伊   我是说真的   够了012---Look, Joey, it's enough, all right?
你老是开这些很蠢的玩笑   还有无聊的暗讽012---You keep making these stupid jokes and these sleazy innuendoes...
真的是不好笑啊012---...and it's just not funny anymore.
对不起   瑞秋  对不起012---All right, I'm sorry. Rach, I'm sorry. Okay? I'm sorry.
也许我可以在谷仓里  粗暴地对持你  来补偿你012---Maybe I could make it up to you by taking you roughly in the barn.
好了   够了  你想做吗  我们来做吧012---All right, you know what? That's it. You want to do it? Let's do it.
没错   我是想和你做012---That's right. I want to do it with you.
我一直想抗拒  但你说的每一句话  都深深打动了我012---Been trying to fight it, but you just said all the right things.
我有吗012---Uh, I did?
有  我想得到你的身体想了好久了012---Yeah, oh, I've been waiting so long to get on that body.
我的身体   对  没错012---This body? Yeah, that's right.
乔伊   放马过来吧012---Come on, Joey, sex me up.
你听起来开始像第七章里的屠夫妻子012---Hey, you're starting to sound like the butcher's wife there in chapter seven.
来吧  不要让我等了   脱掉你的衣服012---Oh, come on, now. Don't keep me waiting. Get those clothes off.
但留着你的头盔   因为这会是一场狂风暴雨012---But I would keep that helmet on, because you're in for a rough ride.
我不要  我好害怕012---I don't want to. I'm scared.
大家好  嘿  嘿012---Hey, guys. Hey.
你们觉得怎么样012---So, what do you think?
你是指什么   指什么012---About what? What?
你在开玩笑吗  好吧  我给你们一个提示  一个提示012---Are you kidding? Okay, I'll give you a hint. I'll give you a hint.
眼睛  不  你的眼睛  不012---Eyes. No, no. Your eyes! No.
钱德的眼睛012---Chandler's eyes!
我戴上了眼镜啊012---I got glasses.
你一直都戴着眼镜啊012---You always had glasses.
没有啊012---No, I didn't.
你确定012---Are you sure?
你不是戴着一副012---Didn't you used to have a pair?
圆形酒红色的眼镜   看起来有一点012---They were really round and burgundy, and they made you look kind of, um...
娘娘腔   对012---Feminine. Yes!
不012---No.
甜心  我觉得你很适合戴眼镜  看起来很性感012---Sweetie, I think the glasses look great. They make you look sexy.
真的吗   对012---Really? Yeah.
你不会也以为  我以前有戴眼镜吧012---You didn't think I used to wear glasses, right?
当然不会012---Of course.
老友记  第七季  第3集  菲比的食谱012---Friends  S07E03  The One With Phoebe's Cookies
你们要什么订婚礼物012---So what do you guys want for an engagement present?
没关系   菲比  我们不办派对了012---Oh, that's okay, Pheebs, we're not having a party or anything...
所以你们不必送我们012---...so you don't have to get us-Ah, buh-buh-buh! Heh.
如果有人想送我们礼物   我们不该剥夺他们的快乐012---If someone wants to give us a present, we don't want to deprive them of that joy.
知道该送他们什么呢  你该送一台便携式CD唱机012---Oh, y'know what you should get 'em? One of those little uh, portable CD players.
我已经有一台了012---Oh, I already have one.
但有人借走了   还把它忘在妇产科诊所了012---Unless someone borrowed it and left it at the gynecologist.
对  至于"那个人"  她指的是乔伊012---Yeah, and by "someone"  she means Joey.
我知道我想要什么了012---Hey, I know what I want!
是我们想要什么  甜心  不  你不会要这个礼物的012---What we want, honey. No, you don't want this.
我想要你奶奶的饼干食谱012---I want to have your grandmother's cookie recipe.
你是说那个巧克力碎片饼干的食谱吗012---You mean the chocolate chip cookie recipe?
对啊   我奶奶临死前012---Uh-huh, yeah. You mean the one that my grandmother...
要我发誓那个饼干食谱012---...made me swear on her deathbed...
绝对不能泄露给外人的012---...that I would never let out of our family?
快死的人都会胡言乱语的012---Dying people say the craziest things.
多年来我一直都想得到它   我想帮我的孩子们做饼干012---I've wanted it for years. I was gonna make cookies for my children.
我真的很难过   好吧012---Break my heart. Oh, all right.
我要当  能做出全世界最好吃饼干的妈妈012---I'll be the mom who makes the world's best chocolate chip cookies.
我们的孩子会是胖子   对吧012---Our kids are gonna be fat, aren't they?
你们好012---Ahoy! Hey.
驾帆船出海还好玩吧  太棒了  我开始喜欢驾驶帆船了012---How's the boat? Great! I'm finally getting into this sailing stuff.
这次你终于出海了012---Oh, so you finally took it out of the marina?
我为什么要那么做012---Why would I do that?
三个彪形大汉使出吃奶的力气   才把它漂在海上012---It took three guys to get the thing in there.
如果你不想开它出海   你在船上都做些什么呢012---If you don't sail your boat,  what do you do on it?
光是坐在上面就很舒服了012---Oh, it's great! It's a great place to just kind of sit...
什么都不做   喝喝啤酒   吃吃洋芋片012---...hang around, drink a few beers, eat some chips.
恭喜你终于找到了  能那样潇洒的地方了012---Well, It's good that you finally have a place to do that.
乔伊  如果你要的话   我可以教你驾驶帆船012---Y'know Joey, I could teach you to sail if you want.
你会驾驶帆船  对啊   我这辈子都在驾船012---You could? Yeah, I've been sailing my whole life.
我十五岁时  我爸就送了我一艘帆船012---When I was 15, my dad bought me my own boat.
你有一艘帆船   怎么了  他想要安慰我012---Your own boat? What?! What?! He was trying to cheer me up.
因为我的小马生病了012---My pony was sick.
你知道我在想什么吗   什么012---You know what I was thinking? What?
没事  我只是想这么做012---Nothing, I just like to go like this.
钱德  今晚你做什么  你有课吗012---Chandler, what are you doing tonight? Why, do you have a lecture?
没有啊  怎么了  那么我没事了  怎么了012---No, why? Then, free as a bird. What's up?
我爸想约你去打回力球012---Uh, my dad wants to know if you want to play racquetball with us.
太棒了  爸一定很喜欢你012---Wow, that's great! Dad must really like you.
他从来不会约人去打回力球   他没有约你012---He doesn't ask just anyone to play. Yeah and he didn't really ask for you.
他要约"小钱"   我猜他应该是指你012---He asked for "Chauncey." I assumed he meant you.
你纠正他了吗012---Did you correct him?
没有  我觉得那样子比较好玩012---No, I thought it would be more fun this way.
太酷了  或许你们每周都该这么做012---This is so cool, maybe this is something you can do this every week.
或者你也可以坐在走廊上012---Or you could sit on the front porch...
确定下垃圾桶不会被偷走012---...and make sure no one steals the trash cans.
他每周都会这么做012---He does that every week too.
你得让他赢   他最讨厌输了012---Just so you know, you have to let him win. He hates to lose.
没问题   要不我用左手打球012---Oh, no problem. Maybe I'll play with my left hand.
你不是左撇子吗012---You're not a lefty?
有人认识我吗012---Does anybody know me?
怎么了  菲比012---What's wrong, Phoebe?
我到以前的公寓去拿饼干食谱012---I just went to my old apartment to get you the cookie recipe...
那场该死的大火把它烧光了012---...and that stupid fire burned it up!
不  你为什么没有复印一份  把它放在防火的盒子里呢012---No! Why didn't you make a copy and keep it in a fireproof box...
而且要它远离起火点   至少一百码的地方012---...and keep it at least 100 yards away from the original?
因为我只是个凡人012---Because I'm normal.
那是我奶奶留给我的传奇012---That was the one legacy my grandmother left me.
我知道你要它当你的订婚礼物012---And I know you wanted it as an engagement present.
我们得送你们订婚礼物012---We have to get you an engagement present?
别担心  菲比012---Don't worry about it. Phoebe.
没有人送我订婚礼物012---No one got me an engagement present.
好  我没有食谱了  但这个给你012---Okay, here. I don't have the recipe, but here.
祝你们健康快乐012---I wish you health and happiness.
一块放了很久的饼干012---An old cookie?
不列出礼物清单   就会发生这种事012---See, this is what happens when you don't register for gifts.
我做了一些饼干  把它们冷冻起来   这是最后一块012---See no-no, I made a batch and I froze it. And this is the only one left.
我们不能收下它  为什么012---We can't accept this. Why not?
因为它很恶心012---Because it's gross.
不  等一下  我想我可以利用这块饼干搞出整个食谱012---No, wait. I think I can figure out the recipe from this cookie.
我在工作时常常这么做012---I do stuff like this at work all the time.
真的吗  真的  我想我应该可以做到012---Really? Yeah, I think I can.
喔  好啊012---On, yay!
好吧   罗斯  我们欠你一份礼物012---Okay, Ross, we owe you a present.
是两份   我订过两次婚012---Two! I've been engaged twice.
快来看看这个小丑012---Look at this clown.
他以为整条河都是他的012---Because he's got a bigger boat he thinks he can take up the whole river.
别挡路啊   大混蛋012---Get out of the way, jackass!
谁会把自己的船   命名为"海岸防卫队"012---Who names their boat Coast Guard, anyway?
因为他们就是海岸防卫队   那他们在这里做什么012---That is the Coast Guard. What are they doing out here?
海岸在那边的嘛012---The coast is all the way over there.
乔伊  别管那些船了012---Joey, just ignore the boats.
我们的课还没上完   好吧012---We're not finished with our lesson. All right.
我要帮你复习一下基本要点  准备好了吗012---I'm gonna go over the basic points just one more time, are you ready?
别麻烦了  瑞秋  我已经懂了  开始驾驶吧012---Come on, Rach. Not again. I got it, okay? Let's start sailing!
我想把船开到   那边有一船小妞旁边去012---I want to go over there where that boatload of girls is. Yeah, oh!
真的吗   你想要012---Oh, okay. is that what you wanna to do?
过去跟那些小妞鬼混012---You wanna go over and give a little shout out to the old, hot chickas?
好了  来吧   水手乔伊012---Okay, let's do that, Sailor Joe.
快问快答   这个叫什么012---Quick question, though: What's this called?
船绳   错了012---Uh, boat rope? Wrong.
要怎么把主帆升上去012---How do you get the mainsail up? Uh...
摸一下就行了012---Rub it?
不  如果我说我们要转向了  你该怎么办012---No. What do you do if I say we're coming about?
我会说  "随你转"012---I'd say, "Come again?" Ha, ha.
不  不   我知道   这一题我会做012---No, no, wait I-I-I know this one, I know this one. Uh, um...
时间到   现在你死了012---Time's up. Now you're dead.
我也聋了012---And deaf!
你继续开玩笑吧012---Okay, you just go on and make your little jokes.
如果你不知道自己在海上做什么012---If you don't know what you're doing out at sea...
你就会在海上丧命   听懂了吗   水手012---...you will die at sea. Am I getting through to you, sailor?
懂了  别只是说你懂了012---Yes. Don't just say yes.
这不是游戏  乔伊  你真可能会受伤的012---This isn't a game. Joey you can really get hurt out here!
你要注意听我说话呢   还是想找死呢012---Okay, So do you want to pay attention, or do you want to die?
我想从船上给钱德打电话012---I want to make a ship-to-shore call to Chandler.
我吃到了肉豆壳  真的吗012---All right, I definitely taste nutmeg. You do?
你没吃到吗   那就是专业人员012---You don't? Heh. Well, that's the difference...
跟外行人的不同点了012---...between a professional and a layman.
没错  专业人员很傲慢012---That and arrogance.
嘿012---Hey.
嘿   出海好玩吗012---Hey. How was sailing?
我不想谈这件事了012---I don't want to talk about it.
你们至少可以留一块饼干给我   不012---Y'know, You could've saved me a whole cookie. No-wait-no-no!
女人太无情了012---Women are mean!
我不敢相信012---I can't believe that.
现在我奶奶的传奇   就只剩下012---Now the only thing left of my grandmother's legacy is...
这一块碎屑了012---...this crumb.
祝你们白头偕老   婚姻美满012---I wish you a long and happy marriage.
嘿   怎么样012---Hey. How was it?
我玩得很开心012---Well, I had a great time.
但是小钱012---Um, Chauncey on the other hand...
让我来说吧012---I will tell the story.
我们相处甚欢   我放手让他赢球   他喜欢我012---It was going great. I let him win, we were bonding...
甚至说我可以叫他爸爸012---...he even said I could call him Dad.
他要你不能叫他什么012---And what did he ask you not to call him?
爹地012---"Daddy."
听着   事情是这样的012---All right look, here's the story.
我们打完球012---Well, we had just finished playing racquetball...
想去做三温暖012---...and we were gonna take a steam.
我走进蒸气室012---I walk into the steam room...
里面雾气弥漫012---...and it's really steamy.
于是我拿下眼镜   悲剧发生了012---So I take off my glasses, and that's when it happened.
你们在哪里012---Guys?
这边来   坐吧   孩子012---Over here. Have a seat, son.
嘿012---Hey!
我的天啊  钱德  我不敢相信  我知道012---Oh, my God, Chandler! I can't believe it. I know.
你在我爸大腿上跳艳舞012---You gave my father a lap dance.
他们为什么要把那里弄得雾气弥漫的012---Why do they put so much steam in there?
不那么做的话   那里只能叫做 "房间"012---Because otherwise they'd have to call it the "room" room.
为什么  为什么会发生那种事012---Why, okay? Why? Why did that have to happen?
别这样啊   没有什么大不了的012---Come on, it's not that big a deal.
那是没有什么大不了的012---Not that big a deal? There--
那会有一种异样的触感012---There was touching of things.
我知道你想跟我爸搞好关系012---Now, I know you wanted to bond with my dad...
但你一定要从他那个地方开始吗012---...but did you really have to bond to that part?
我相信爸不会在乎的  或许他只是会觉得很好笑012---Listen, I'm sure that Dad doesn't care. He probably thought this was funny.
他会把这个故事挂在嘴边好几年012---He'll be telling this story for years.
我就是不希望他这样012---I don't want him to tell this story for years.
喔   但他会那么做的012---Oh, but he will.
他还是会告诉大家  摩妮卡试图逃出减肥营的故事012---He still tells the story about how Monica tried to escape from fat camp.
我才没有逃跑012---I wasn't escaping.
那么你怎么会被卡在铁丝网上的012---Then how'd you get caught in the barbed wire?
我想要救一只松鼠012---I was trying to help out a squirrel.
你想吃掉他012---You were trying to eat it.
如果是你爸打电话来   告诉你这件事012---If that is your father calling to tell this story...
那么我们的婚礼就要取消了012---...then the marriage is off!
别这样啊   喂012---Come on. Hello.
对不起   你打错电话了012---I'm sorry, you have the wrong number.
我待会回你电话  爸   我爱你012---Okay, I'll call you later, Dad. I love you.
好了  我要去见你爸了012---All right, I'm off to see your dad. Oh, whoa.
你不会是穿的太多了吗012---Whoa-whoa, aren't you a little over dressed?
你最好确定  这次他会付你小费012---Yeah, and you better make sure he tips you this time.
我想说服他  别再提那件事了012---Look, I figured I would try to convince him not to tell the story anymore...
我想最好的办法   就是跟他面对面谈一谈012---...and I figured the best way to do that was face to face.
我说的 "面对面"  指的不是他的大腿012---And by "face," I don't mean his lap.
我说的"面对面"  指的不是我的屁股012---And by "face," I don't mean my ass.
你要送摩妮卡跟钱德订婚礼物012---Are you getting Monica and Chandler an engagement present?
我不知道   他们没有送我们礼物012---I don't know. You know, they didn't get us anything.
谢谢你012---Thank you!
嘿  嗨012---Hey. Hey.
嗨012---Well, hello.
我们什么时候再出航   伙伴012---So when are we getting back out on the water, matey?
我不知道水手是怎么说的   但我死都不要012---Oh, uh, I don't know the boat way to say this, but, never.
为什么   因为你在船上很凶012---Why not? Because you're mean on the boat.
什么   我只是想教会你012---What? I was just trying to teach you.
我的确长了教训   那就是瑞秋很凶012---Well, lesson learned. Rachel is mean.
对  对  没错012---Yep, yep, Yep, Yep, Yep, Yep-
我还记得她驾驶她爸的船带我出海012---I remember when she took me out on her dad's boat.
完全不让我插手012---She wouldn't let me help out at all.
对不起  我要你帮我  但你连动都动不了012---Excuse me, I wanted you to help. But you couldn't move your arms...
因为你穿了三件救生衣012---...because you were wearing three life jackets.
我们得敬畏大海012---You have to respect the sea.
乔伊  如果你觉得我很凶   对不起012---Look, Joey, I'm sorry if you thought that was mean.
但我要告诉你   我一点都不凶012---But I tell you something, that was not mean.
我爸才凶   以前在船上  他总会对我大吼大叫012---My father is mean. He used to yell at me all the time on the boat.
那才真的可怕   我是个很棒的老师012---It was horrible. I was being a really good teacher.

我不希望你被船桨打中012---Yeah, I didn't want you to get hit by the boom.
它的确打中我了012---Well, it hit me anyway.
如果我能喝完最后一罐啤酒  或许不会那么痛012---And it would have hurt a lot less if I had finished that last beer.
对不起  我会试着小声点  不再对你大吼大叫012---y'know what? I'm sorry. I will try to tone it down and, uh, stop yelling.

我们来试试尝尝吧012---Mm. Let's give it a shot. Ugh.
自从九年级后  我再也没做过这么多饼干012---I have not made so many cookies since 9th grade.
你为了义卖会做那么多饼干吗  不  那是我星期五晚上要吃的012---What was that for, Like a bake sale? No, just a Friday night.
这些饼干真的很好吃012---Mm. These are pretty good.

不012---No.
是左边   甜心  没关系   那一题太难了012---It's left, sweetie, but that's okay. That's a tough one.
为什么不干脆说左边就好了呢012---I don't know why you just don't say left.
好吧  到左边去012---Okay, go to the left.
左边012---Ahem, the left.
坐在那边012---Huh? Just sit over there!
看到没   你又在大吼大叫了012---Okay! Okay! You're yelling again. See that?

乔伊  别这样  我刚刚才教过你012---Joey, come on! We just went over this.
你教我的时候  有只乌嘴巴里衔着鱼飞了过去012---Oh, y'know, when we did that was when that bird was overhead with the fish in his mouth.
你看到了吗   好恶心  没有  我没有看到鸟012---Did you see it? It was gross. No! All right?! I did not see the bird.
没有看到鱼  也没看到形状像泰森的保丽龙012---I did not see the fish! I did not see the piece of Styrofoam shaped like Mike Tyson!
我没有看到   因为我忙着教你驾驶帆船012---I did not, because I was trying to teach you how to sail a boat.
很明显   那是不可能的012---Which obviously is an impossible thing to do.
够了  你在大吼大叫  而且你也没有脱掉上衣012---All right that's it! You're yelling, and I don't see you taking your top off.
我放弃了012---I quit!
你是什么意思  你不能放弃   为什么012---What do you mean? You can't quit. Why not?

我姓崔比亚尼  崔比亚尼家的人会放弃012---I'm a Tribbiani. And Tribbianis quit!
我的天啊012---Oh, my God. Wait.
刚刚我说  "葛林家的人不会放弃" 对吧012---Did I--? I just said, "Greens don't quit," didn't I?
我到底说了没有  说了  你还在对我大吼大叫012---Did I just say, "Greens don't quit"? Yes! And you're still yelling at me.
不  我没有对你大吼大叫  我是对你身边的空气大吼大叫012---No! No! No! I'm not yelling at you. I'm just yelling near you.
天啊   乔伊  我就跟我爸一样012---Oh, God, Joey. Oh, I'm my father.
天啊   真的太可怕了012---Oh, my God. This is horrible.
我很努力不要跟我妈一样  却没有提防到这一点012---I've been trying so hard not to be my mother, I did not see this coming.
喔   乔伊012---Ugh, Joey.
抱歉  我真的很抱歉  我只希望你能学会驾驶帆船012---I'm sorry, I'm so sorry. I just wanted you to learn.

抬头看我们012---Looking UP?
她对我真的很好   但现在她一定在地狱里012---Oh, yeah, no, she was really nice to me but she's in hell for sure.
我已经努力过了  我放弃012---Well, I've tried everything. I give up.

我在法国的亲戚   可能有人知道012---Well, You know, I may have relatives in France who would know.
我奶奶说食谱是她奶奶012---My grandmother said she got the recipe...

对012---Yes!

我知道   就是这样的事情012---I know! You see, it is stuff like this...
害得你得在地狱里受苦012---...which is why you're burning in hell!

我觉得很不好意思012---You know, I’m a little...I'm a little embarrassed about it.

太棒了  非常不错  摩妮卡  很好012---Great, that's great, Monica. Great.
好了  钱德   你能笑一个吗012---Now, Chandler, you want to give us a smile?
好吧012---0Kay.
对不起  那张椅子很不舒服吗  不  是我很不舒服012---I'm sorry, is the seat uncomfortable? No, I am.
钱德  我知道你办得到   你笑起来很帅的012---Chandler, I know you can do this. Okay? You have a beautiful smile.
是吗  没错012---I do? Yeah.
或许你不必笑   我们来试试别的点子   试着012---All right, maybe you don't have to smile. Let's try something else. Let's try, um--
试着表现出性感的样子  好吧012---Try looking sexy. Okay.
还是不要吧012---Or not.
乔伊  你在这里做什么012---Hi, Joey, what are you doing here?
我要在附近试镜   结果酱汁沾到衣服上了012---I got an audition down the street, and I spilled sauce all over my shirt.
你有多余的衬衫吗  当然有012---You got an extra one? Yeah, sure. Um...
拿去吧012---Here.
太棒了012---Great.
你有除了罗夫罗兰外   其他品牌的衣服吗012---You got anything that's not Ralph Lauren?
应该没有  乔伊012---Yeah, I don't think so, Joe.
好吧  我猜这件应该可以012---All right, I guess this'll be fine.
你今晚要做什么   没事  怎么了012---Hey, Listen, uh, what are you doing tonight? Nothing. Why?
你要不要带我的助理泰格   出去玩012---How would you feel about taking out my assistant Tag?
我付钱012---I'll pay. Heh.
要我跟男人出去约会  可得付我一大笔钱012---Huh, Rach I got to say it's gonna take a lot of money for me to go out on a date with a dude.
我不是要你跟他约会012---I'm not asking you to go on a date with him.
真的吗   因为我真的很缺钱012---Really? Because I could kind of use the money.
乔伊  他刚搬到这里来  我知道他没有男性朋友012---Joey, just-He's new in town and he doesn't have any guy friends.
带他去看看球赛或做点别的事  我会非常感激你012---Just take him to a ball game or something. I'd appreciate it.
好的  没问题  谢谢你012---Yeah, okay, no problem. Thank you.
是甜甜圈012---Ooh, hey, doughnuts! Uh-huh.
我知道  我们来试试看012---I know. Let's try a look...
出神的表情012---...of far-off wonderment.
凝视我们的未来  想想我们的婚姻跟以后的日子012---Okay, we'll-we'll gaze into our future and we'll think about our marriage and the days to come.
钱德  你的脸到底是怎么了012---Chandler, what is the matter with your face?
这张照片应该要表达   "盖勒和宾府喜事"的012---I mean this picture's supposed to say "Geller and Bing to be married"...
不是"英勇女市民  救了快淹死的蠢蛋"012---...not "Local woman saves drowning moron."
嘿   别笑他012---Ha-ha-ha. Hey, don't laugh at him.
这个快淹死的蠢蛋是我的012---He's my drowning moron.
对了  就是这样  快拍下来012---Aw. That's it, that's it! Take it, take it!
我喜欢这一张012---I like this one.
它似乎是在说  "我爱你  所以我要杀了你"012---It seems to say, "I love you and that's why I have to kill you."
不会全部都那么糟糕啦012---They can't all be bad.
找那张你装出  睡眼朦胧的照片012---Find the one where you make your bedroom eyes.
我找到了012---Oh, there it is.
我的天啊   这就是我睡眼朦胧的样子012---Oh, my God, those are my bedroom eyes?
你为什么要跟我同床共枕012---Why did you ever sleep with me?
你真的想提这件事情吗012---Do you really want to pull at that thread?
我真的玩得很开心  我也是012---I'm having a really good time. Me too.
很抱歉地铁里那个家伙  舔了你的脖子012---Sorry that guy on the subway licked your neck.
不  没关系  他是朋友012---No, that's okay. He's a friend.
恕我放肆012---Uh, I don't mean to be presumptuous...
但我有明天国标舞总决赛的门票  如果你想去的话012---...but I have these two tickets to the ballroom-dancing finals tomorrow night if you want to go?
对  我012---Yeah, I--
我没有看准决赛  我想我看不懂012---Well y'know I-I mean I missed the semi-finals, so I think I would just be lost.
我知道那样真的很无聊   但这些票是我的老板012---Heh, I know that it's lame, but I got these tickets from my boss--
喔  不  我的天啊012---Oh, no, no, no, my God!
好了  别大惊小怪的   我去就是了  不012---Okay, don't freak out. I'll go. No, it's--
是我的前妻惠特妮012---My ex-wife Whitney is out there.
我现在没办法面对她   那个女人疯了012---I cannot deal with her now. That woman is crazy.
好吧  我知道  等一下012---Okay, I know. Hold on.
嘿   罗斯  什么事012---Hey, Ross. Yeah.
凯尔的前妻  惠特妮就在外面012---Yeah. Urn, that's Whitney, Kyle's ex-wife out there.
你可以把她诱开   让我们脱身吗012---Do you think that you can y'know divert her so that we can slip out?
什么  不012---What? No.
好吧  但我有两张国标舞总决赛的门票012---Okay, but I have two tickets to the ballroom-dance finals.
我想还是不要吧   菲比012---Look, I don't think so, Pheebs. I, heh--
好吧   我愿意012---All right, I'll do it.
但那只是因为你是我的朋友   好吧012---But just because you're a friend. Okay.
嗨  大舞王012---Hi, Ginger.
我要拿回我的钥匙012---All right! I want my key back.
我没拿  钥匙就那里012---I don't have it. It's right there.
好吧  大侦探福尔摩斯012---Ugh. Okay, Sherlock.
对不起  但你最好快点离开   菲比012---Look, I'm sorry, but you'd better go, Pheebs.
我只是要谢谢你   帮我们诱开凯尔的前妻012---All right. I just wanted to thank you though for diverting Kyle's ex.
别客气  待会再谈012---Oh, yeah, no, you're welcome. We'll, uh, talk about it later.
好012---Okay. Heh.
嗨  惠特妮   嗨   罗斯012---Hi, Whitney. Hi, Ross.
你准备好要去吃早餐了吗   是的012---Are you ready for breakfast? Yep. Ooh.
凯尔的前妻你应该要诱开她  不是跟她约会012---Kyle's ex-wife? You were supposed to divert her, not date her.
你能不能等我一下  我得跟这个女人谈一谈012---Sorry, can you give me a second while I talk to this woman...
顺便一提  她没有在这里过夜012---...uh, who, by the way, did not spend the night?
没问题   好吧012---Sure. Okay. Eh, heh...
我的确诱开她了  后来我们玩得很开心   好吗012---I did divert her, and we ended up having a great time, okay?
你们一起去看国标舞比赛   对啊012---Watching ballroom dancing? Yes.
那时我们发现  事实上我们俩都酷呆了012---That's where we realized we are both super cool people.
听着  罗斯  凯尔告诉我  她有些很差劲的缺点012---Look, okay, Ross. Kyle just told me some really bad stuff about her.
譬如说呢   譬如说她很无情012---Like what? Like she's really mean.
她喜欢吹毛求疵012---And she's overly critical and-And-No.
她会不经过你的同意   就把房间刷成很明亮的颜色012---She will paint a room a really bright color without even checking with you.
好吧012---0Kay.
她还会把性当成武器012---And she uses sex as a weapon.
谢谢你的警告012---Fine. Thank you for warning me.
早餐时我会注意   油漆跟性武器012---At breakfast, I'll be on full alert for room painting and sex weapons.
你还是要跟她约会  对012---You're still gonna go outwith her? Yeah.
你没有听到  刚刚我说的话吗012---Well, didn't you hear what I just said?
菲比  少来了  你的消息来源有问题012---Pheebs, come on. I mean, consider the source.
她的前夫当然会那么说   请你离开了啦012---Of course her ex-husband's gonna say that stuff. Now if you'll excuse me.
听我说   她疯了012---No, listen to me, she is crazy!
你的门没有隔音功能012---Uh, your door isn't sound proof.
看到了吧   她就是爱挑剔012---You see? Nothing is good enough for her.
早安  嗨  泰格012---Morning. Hi, Tag.
昨晚你跟乔伊玩得开心吗012---Hey, so did you have fun with, uh, Joey last night?
对  我们去看《尼克队》比赛012---Yeah, we went to the Knicks game.
真的太棒了012---Aw, that's nice.
然后我们去酒吧玩   他帮我们泡上好多女人012---Then we went to this bar, and he hooked us up with all these women.
女人  你是说老女人012---Women? You mean, like old women?
有点老  大概三十岁012---Kind of old, like 30.
是喔  我以前没办法012---Oh. And I never used to be able...
在酒吧里跟女人聊天012---...to just talk to girls in bars...
但昨晚我就拿到了  二十个电话号码012---...but I got, like, 20 phone numbers last night.
真的是太棒了012---That's great.
乔伊真的教会你一些事012---Oh, man. So Joey must have really taught you some stuff.
没错  是啊012---A little. Yeah.
你好吗012---How you doing?
看吧  那个笑容非常灿烂   轻松  自然012---See? That's a great smile. Easy, natural.
现在假装我手上拿了照相机012---Now pretend I have a camera.
你的笑容变了  我控制不了自己012---You're changing it. I can't help it.
好吧  你想知道  我都是怎么拍沙龙照的吗012---All right. all right, You want to know what I do when I take resume shots?
你跟我借钱012---Borrow money from me?
对  好吧  首先  你得装出自然的样子012---Yeah. Okay, first of all, you want to make it look spontaneous.
我都是这么做的  我会低头  低头  继续低头012---So here's what I do. I look down, look down, keep looking down.
然后抬头012---Then I look up.
看到没  现在你来试试看012---See? All right, now you try.
低头  低头  继续低头012---Look down. You're looking down. Keep looking down.
你的鞋子上为什么会有果酱012---Why is there jelly on your shoe?
我吃了甜甜圈   是喔012---I had a doughnut. Oh.
嗨  嘿012---Hi. Hey.
听说昨晚你跟泰格玩得很开心012---So, I heard you had some fun with Tag last night.
对  那家伙还不错012---Yeah, that guy's all right.
对  你很高兴教他怎么当 "乔伊"012---Yeah, and you had fun teaching him how to be all "Joey."
什么  你知道的  泡马子012---What? You know, all the women.
你没办法教别人怎么泡马子012---Hey well, You can't teach someone to be good with women.
所以我跟钱德出去  老是泡不到马子012---Y'know, That's why I never had any luck with Chandler.
我在这里啊012---I'm right here.
你能不能别再跟他一起出去了012---All right, Would you mind just not going outwith him again?
就是你跟他一起去泡马子012---Okay, just the idea of you and he and all these women--it's just
我知道他是我的助理   我不能跟他约会012---And I know he's my assistant, and I can't date him, blah!
但这真的让我很困扰   好吗012---but it just bothers me, all right?
不  你不能抢走他012---No, no, no, you can't take him away from me.
我终于找到一个  可以跟我一起去泡马子的拍档了012---I got a great partner to pick up girls with. Finally!
我还在这里啊012---I'm still right here.
至少你可以跟他谈一谈012---All right, will you at least talk to him...
告诉他跟一大堆女人约会   既空虚又得不到满足012---...and tell him how hollow and unsatisfying this dating-tons-of-women thing is?
什么012---What?
在我结束对他的暗恋之前  我不要他跟任何人约会012---I just don't want him to meet anybody until I'm over my crush.
我会忘记他的012---And I will get over it.
我并不爱他  那只是肉体上的吸引力012---It's not like I love him. It's just physical.
我常常这样暗恋男人   刚认识你时我就暗恋过你012---But—I mean I get these crushes all the time. Hell, I had a crush on you when I met you.
我知道  摩妮卡跟我说过012---I know. Monica told me.
我们刚认识时  你暗恋过我吗012---Did you have a crush on me when you first met me?
对  有啊012---Yeah, sure.
难道你们就是看不到我吗012---Can you people not see me?
你能跟他谈谈吗012---So will you talk to him?
我不知道  瑞秋  我会送你十件罗夫罗兰的衬衫012---I don't know, Rach. Oh, come on! I'll give you 10 Ralph Lauren shirts.
一件012---One.
不   十件   你说十件   你不能反悔012---No, 10. You said 10. You can't take that back.
嘿   你有事要跟我谈012---Hey Joey, You wanted to talk to me?
我不知道   你拿了东西来给我吗012---I don't know. You, uh, got something for me?
对  这是端秋要给你的012---Oh, yeah, this is from Rachel.
十件  好吧012---Ten. Okay.
泰格  跟太多女人约会下场是不好的012---Tag, there's such a thing as too many women.
真的吗   对你来说是的012---Really? Yeah, for you.
嘿   你来了  我来了012---Hey, there you are. There I am.
你没事吧   没事   乔伊说我需要放轻松012---You okay? Yeah, Joey said I, uh, needed to relax.
他给我吃抗组脐药012---So he gave me an antihistamine.
什么  对啊012---What? Yeah.
我搭地铁时睡着了  结果到了布鲁克林012---and then I fell asleep on the subway and went to Brooklyn.
布鲁克林好远012---Brooklyn is far.
你在想什么012---Chandler, What were you thinking?
我不知道  别担心  因为现在我知道要怎么拍照了012---I don't know, But don't worry, because I know how to take a picture now.
好了  看吧  低头012---Okay, see. Look down.
低头012---Look down.
低头012---Look down.
钱德  什么事012---Chandler? Yeah?
嗨  嗨012---Hi. Hi.
你跟疯婆子还好吧   她把你的兔子拿去煮了吗012---So how are things going with Crazy? Has she cooked your rabbit yet?
听着  你只听到片面之词  好吗012---Listen, you are hearing one side of the story. Okay?
还有  她拿了三十份   油漆样本给凯尔看012---and FYI, she must have shown Kyle over 30 paint samples...
之后才动手漆房间的012---...before she painted that room.
他对每一份样本的反应是  "我一点都不在乎"012---And his response to each one was, "I don't give a tiny rat's ass."
或许她该少花点时间在装修上012---Yeah well, maybe she should have spent a little less time decorating...
多花一点时间在卧室里012---...and a little more time in the bedroom.
我想我们不会有那样的问题吧012---Well, I don't think we are going to have that problem...
但或许那是因为  我不会吝于付出感情012---...but maybe that's just because I am not emotionally unavailable.
你认为他吝于付出感情012---You think he's emotionally unavailable?
我想有那个可能012---I think he can be.
如果她没有012---Well, Maybe he wouldn't be...
每晚把公事带回家做  或许他就不会那样子012---...if she didn't bring the office home every night.
你得原谅她   知道该怎么面对她的生活012---Well excuse her for knowing what she wants to do with her life.
她的确知道  她在1997年除夕做了什么012---Well, she certainly knew what she was doing New Year's Eve 1997.
我就知道你会那么说012---I knew you were gonna throw that in my face!
那是三年前的事  她一再地道歉012---That was three years ago. She apologized and apologized.
你还想怎么样012---What more do you want?
我们要找回六年的时光012---We want the last six years back!
我们也是  我们也是012---So do we! So do we!
很抱歉  让你们看到这一幕012---I'm sorry you had to see that.
早安  端秋  嗨012---Morning, Rachel. Hi.
昨晚你做了什么012---Hey, so, uh, what'd you do last night?
我跟乔伊出去了  是吗012---Went out with Joey. Oh, yeah?
你们又去泡妞了012---Another night of bird-dogging the chicas?
不  我们坐下来长谈012---No, we had a really good talk. Oh.
我想我不会  再去酒吧泡女人了012---I don't think I'm gonna do that bar scene anymore.
我没想到你会那么说012---Wow, I did not see that coming.
那不是真正的我012---It's just not really who I am.
我一直都很快乐  当012---Y'know, I've always been happier when--
我为什么要告诉你这件事012---Why am I telling you this?
你不会关心这种事  不  我很关心012---You don't care about this stuff. Yes, I do. I do.
刚刚你说  "我一直都很快乐  当"012---Go on. You were saying, "I'm happier when I'm--"
当我谈恋爱时012---When I'm in a relationship.
我喜欢女朋友陪在身边  真的吗012---I love having a girlfriend. Really?
我可以好好宠爱她012---Yeah. Someone I can spoil, you know.
宠爱012---Sp-Spoil? Uh-huh.
我要问你一件事012---Let me ask you something. Uh-huh?
你相信我们都在寻找另一半吗012---Do you believe there's one perfect person for everyone?
我开始相信了012---I'm starting to.
如果那个人已经出现在你的生命中   你应该努力去争取吗012---And if that person's in your life, you should do something about it?
对  当然012---Yes. Hell, yes.
好吧  那么我就安心了012---All right, then, it's settled. Okay.
我要跟我前女友复合   我愿意012---I'm getting back together with my ex. I would love to!
什么012---What?
喂012---Hello?
我应该会谈上一阵子  对不起012---Oh. This is gonna be a while. Excuse me.
对012---Um, yeah.
对012---Yeah.
我的天啊012---My God!
对不起   吵到你了吗012---Oh, I'm sorry. Is that annoying?
说到在床上很自私   惠特妮还好吗012---And speaking of being selfish in bed, how's Whitney?
或许她不必在床上很自私012---Well maybe she wouldn't have to be selfish in bed...
如果另一个人知道  哪里是哪里012---...if someone else knew where everything was.
他的确知道012---Oh, he knows. Heh.
大部份啦012---For the most part.
嘿  太好了  你们两个都在012---Oh, hey. Good, you're both here.
我们得谈一谈012---We kind of need to talk.
你们两个在一起  怎么了012---Both of you together? What's up?
昨晚我到凯尔家   拿一些东西012---Well, I went over to Kyle's last night to pick up a few things...
我们回忆了一些往事012---...and we got to reminiscing.
几乎谈了一整个晚上012---We talked most of the night...
我们明白  我们会这么气对方012---...and we realized the reason we're angry with each other...
是因为我们还对彼此有感觉012---...is because there are still feelings there.
所以012---So...
喔  快说吧  凯尔012---Oh, just say it, Kyle!
我们要再试一次012---We're gonna give it another try.
你不是说她爱抱怨   常常要人注意她吗012---What about her whining, and her constant need for attention?
我会努力调整自己012---I'm gonna work on that.
对  因为你很善变012---Oh, right, because you're so capable of change.
你知道的  他会边尿边哼歌012---You know, he hums when he pees.
我知道  所以他都尿不准   但那不重要012---I do know. Makes him miss the bowl, but whatever.
我们很抱歉012---We're so sorry.
没关系   我们不需要你们  我已经忘了这件事012---That's all right. We don't need you. I'm over it already.
对  我根本一点都不在乎012---Yeah, and I don't even give a tiny rat's ass.
我们得走了012---Yeah, we're gonna go.
对不起012---I'm sorry.
菲比  你没有看错她012---Pheebs, you were right about her.
她的确试图把性当成武器012---You know, she did try to use sex as a weapon.
我的背有一点痛012---Yeah, I hurt my back a little.
他做其他事时  也会哼歌012---You know, he hums while he does other stuff too.
没有他们  我们能过得更好012---We're better off without them. Heh.
就算他们再分手  千万别让他加入你的什么伤心男子俱乐部012---And y'know, Even if they break up again, you better not let him in your sad men's club.
是离婚男人俱乐部   有什么不一样呢012---Divorced men's club. Potato, "potato."
大家快来看012---Hey, guys, check it out.
我妈把报纸寄给我   我们来瞧瞧012---My morn sent me the paper. Ooh, let's see it. Yay.
看起来不错   你们看起来很配啊012---Oh, yeah, that looks good. You guys make a very attractive couple.
对  我们是天生一对   一点都没错012---Yeah, we look great together. We really do.
好吧012---0Kay.
想像一下我们的孩子会是什么模样012---Imagine what our kids would look like.
我们不必想像012---You know, we don't have to imagine.
我要娶她012---I'm marrying her.
走着瞧吧012---We'll just see.
我约你们来吃早午餐的原因012---Okay, the reason why I asked you guys out to brunch today...
是因为我一直在想伴娘的问题012---...is because I have been doing some thinking about who should be my maid of honor.
我的天啊   这一刻终于等到了012---Oh, my God. This is it. Oh.
我希望是你012---I really hope it's you!
我希望是你  我也是012---I hope it's you. Me too.
首先  我非常爱你们012---First of all, I love you both so much.
你们对我来说都很重要   废话少说   到底是谁012---and you're both so important to me. Okay, Blah, blah, blah. Who is it?
我想  我们可以想出一个办法012---Well umm, I was thinking that maybe we could come up with a system...
轮流当彼此的伴娘012---...where we trade off being maid of honor for each other.
假设菲比是我的伴娘  太棒了012---Like hypothetically, if Phoebe were mine-Yes! Oh.
那只是假设012---Hypothetically.
一样啦012---Still.
如果菲比是我的伴娘   瑞秋  是菲比的伴娘   我是瑞秋的伴娘012---If Phoebe were my maid of honor. Rachel would be Phoebe's, I'd be Rachel's.
这样我们都可以当伴娘   没有人会难过012---that way we all get to do it once and no one would get upset.
是个好办法   我要参加   谁会是你的伴娘呢012---That's actually a pretty good idea. Yeah, I'll do that. So who gets to be yours?
不过那是最棒的  你们得决定谁来当我的伴娘012---Well, that's the best part. You guys get to decide.
为什么那是最棒的   这样我就不必决定了012---Why is that the best part? Because then I don't have to.
当然我们会帮你决定   我们会尽力帮你的012---Of course we'll help you decide. We'll do anything we can to help you.
我想要举杯012---I'd like to make a toast.
敬未来的钱德宾太太012---To the future Mrs. Chandler Bing...
我最好的朋友跟最棒的012---...my best friend and truly one of the nicest people that--
我真的还没有决定   好吧012---Really not deciding. Fine.
对不起   我不是故意要偷听的012---Excuse me, I couldn't help overhearing.
你要嫁给钱德宾   对啊012---You're marrying Chandler Bing? Yeah that's right.
祝你好运012---Huh, Good luck!
我也祝你好运012---Oh, and good luck to you too!
她真是好心啊012---What a nice lady.
老友记   第七季  第06集  午睡的同伴012---Friends  S07E06  The One With The Nap Partners
太棒了012---Yeah!
《终极警探》 还是很好看的  没错012---Die Hard, still great. Yep.
要看第二支片子吗012---Hey, what do you say we make it a double feature?
你还租了什么012---What else did you rent?
《终极警探续集》012---Die Hard 2.
乔伊   这也是《终极警探1》012---Joey, this is Die Hard 1 again.
我们要再看一遍  那就等于是《终极警探续集》了012---Well, we'll watch it a second time and it's Die Hard 2.
乔伊  我们刚刚才看完续集  所以呢012---Joey, we just saw it. And?
再看一次一定很酷012---And it'll be cool to see it again!
太棒了  《终极警探》 《终极警探》012---Yeah! Die Hard! Die Hard!
兄弟   你没有说《终极警探》012---Dude, you didn't say Die Hard.
你还好吗012---Is everything okay?
还好  只是我有别的事要做012---Yeah, I just got uh, got plans.
约翰麦克连也有别的事要做012---Well, John McClane had plans.
我想在乔伊大开杀戒012---No, see the thing is I want to get out of here before Joey gets all worked up...
开始叫大家"混蛋"前离开012---...and starts calling everybody "bitch."
你在胡说什么啊   混蛋012---What are you talking about, bitch?
嘿   瑞秋  什么事012---Hey, Rachel. Yeah?
我结婚时  你愿意当我的伴娘吗012---When I get married, will you be my maid of honor?
真的吗012---Really?
我的天啊   我是说我   菲比012---Oh, my God, Phoebe. I mean, I'm just--
等一下012---Wait a minute.
如果我是你的伴娘   那就表示你是摩妮卡的伴娘012---If I'm your maid of honor, that means that you are Monica's.
喔012---Oh.
如果你真的想那么做   随便你了012---Well, if that's what you want. Oh!
想都别想   菲比   我想当摩妮卡的伴娘012---No way, Phoebe. I want to be Monica's.
为什么这件事这么重要   那你为什么觉得这么重要呢012---But why does it even matter? Why does it matter so much to you?
因为她马上就要结婚了012---Because this one is now.
我们两个最好的朋友要结婚了012---And it's two of our best friends.
谁知道你会嫁给什么样的人012---And who knows what you're gonna marry.
如果我嫁给罗斯呢   或乔伊012---What-what if I marry Ross? Or Joey?
你不会的012---You wouldn't.
好吧  听我说  瑞秋  我知道你真的想当摩妮卡的伴娘012---Okay, look, Rachel. I know you really want to do this...
但我从来没有当过伴娘012---...but I've never been maid of honor to anyone before.
我知道你至少当过两次伴娘012---I know you've done it at least twice.
对  但是菲比  请你让我把话说完012---Yeah, but, Phoebe. And no, oh please, oh please let me finish.
我猜我已经说完了012---I guess that was it.
好吧012---0Kay.
好   既然你没有当过伴娘   你可以当摩妮卡的伴娘012---Okay. Since you've never done it before, you can be Monica's maid of honor.
谢谢你012---Oh, thank you so much!
好啊012---Yay.
我一定会嫁个好男人012---I'm gonna marry someone good y'know.
我知道012---Oh, I know.
比钱德还棒012---Better than Chandler.
发生了什么事   我不知道012---What happened? I don't know.
我们睡着了  就那么简单012---We fell asleep. That is all.
对  对吗  对012---Yeah. Yeah? Yeah.
好了  我得走了012---All right, well, I'd better go.
那最好了   没错012---I think that would be best. Yeah.
我待会再跟你谈   好012---I'll talk to you later. Okay.
但千万别谈这件事  没错  永远都别提  永远012---But not about this. No, never. Never!
所以012---So, uh... Uh...
再见   别碰我   别碰我012---Bye. No touch. No touch.
我吃早午餐时  发生了一件怪事012---Hey, a weird thing happened today when I was at brunch.
有个女人不经意听到   我要嫁给你012---This woman overheard that I was marrying you...
她跑来祝我好运012---...and she wished me good luck.
太好了012---That's sweet.
不   她的意思是  "祝你好运"012---No, it was more like a "good luck."
那个女人长什么样012---So, what did this woman look like?
大概三十岁   深色头发  很漂亮012---She was like 30, dark hair, attractive.
你该不会是刚好看到一种  叫做镜子的东西吧012---Well, is there any chance you were looking into a bright, shiny thing called a mirror?
她会是你大学时的女朋友吗012---Come on, was it somebody maybe you dated in college?
不   在大学时   我只交过两个女朋友012---No, no I only dated two girls in college...
她们都是金发  也不漂亮012---...both blond, both not attractive.
等等   让我看看012---Hold on one second. Let me check this out.
你在做什么  来瞧瞧吧012---What are you doing? Well, let's see.
好吧  是她吗012---Okay, uh, is that her?
我的天啊   没错012---Oh, my God, yes!
她是谁  菜丽葛扛菲   我的夏令营女朋友012---Who is she? Julie Graff, my camp girlfriend.
你跟她分手了012---Did you break up with her?
不   我们还在一起012---No, we're still together.
我们交往了两个暑假   后来我跟她分手了012---We went out for two summers and then I broke up with her.
为什么  第三年的暑假012---Why? She came back the third summer...
她变得有一点012---...and she'd gotten really fa-aa-aw-ow...
胖  我没有那么说012---Fat? I did not say fat.
我是说012---I said "Fa-aa-aw-ow…"
你只因为女生胖   就跟她分手012---You broke up with a girl because she was fat?
对  对啊012---Yeah. Yeah.
但那真的是很久以前的事了   她还在难过吗012---But it was a really, really long time ago. Does she still feel bad?
看起来是的012---Well, apparently she does.
有句俗话说  "大象永远都不会忘记"012---You know what they say, "Elephants never forget."
说真的  要嫁给我  祝你好运012---Seriously, good luck marrying me.
嘿  发生了什么事012---Hey, what's going on?
菲比会是摩妮卡的伴娘012---Phoebe is gonna be Monica's maid of honor.
希望这次会比上次  你帮楼下那个女孩当伴娘顺利  记得吗012---Hey. Well I hope it goes better than the last time you did it for that girl downstairs, remember?
你以前当过伴娘012---You have been maid of honor before?
你看吧  那就是人不能说谎的原因012---You see? This is exactly why you shouldn't lie.
够了   我是伴娘012---All right that's it. I am maid of honor.
不   我才是  为什么是你012---No, I am. How come you are?
因为我在乎到不惜说谎012---Because I cared enough to lie.
我可以帮你们决定   该由谁来当伴娘012---Hey-hey-hey-hey, I could help you decide who should do it.
我们应该办个甄试会012---We could have like uh, like an audition
看看你们当伴娘时   遇到突发事件会怎么处理012---and see how you'd handle maid-of-honor-type situations.
你是什么意思   当我需要一份工作时012---What are you talking about? Like when I want a job...
我会去试镜   如果他们觉得我是最棒的012---...I go to an audition and if I'm the best of the people they see...
我就可以演出012---...they give me the part.
好了  甄试完毕后  谁来决定伴娘人选012---Okay, so after this audition, who decides who gets it?
我跟罗斯可以当评审012---Oh, me and Ross can be the judges.
这要比让我们自己来决定好   这太疯狂了012---It's better than us deciding. Oh, come on! this is crazy.
我们不能丢铜板决定吗   不   铜板恨我012---Can't we just flip a coin? No, coins hate me.
好吧  你知道吗  我们让罗斯跟乔伊来决定012---Okay, Okay fine, You know what? We will let Ross and Joey decide.
嗨012---Hi!
罗斯  甜心012---Ross, sweetie.
你好  大帅哥012---Hey there, you handsome thing.
这种古龙水的确跟亚曼尼的一样棒012---Wow, this cologne really is every bit as good as Giorgio.
嘿012---Hey.
我把录影带拿来还你012---Just brought back your videos.
罗斯  听着  我想我们需要谈谈之前的事了012---Hey, Ross. Look, I think we need to talk about before.
不  千万别提那件事012---No. No, we don't.
不  我们非谈不可012---Yes, we do.
好了  听我说  那是我睡得最香甜的一觉了012---Now, look. That was the best nap I ever had.
我不知道你在说什么012---I don't know what you're talking about.
少来了  承认吧012---Come on, admit it.
那是你睡过最香甜的一觉012---That was the best nap you ever had.
我有过更棒的经验012---I've had better.
好吧  什么时候012---Okay. When?
好吧  好吧  那是我睡过最香甜的一觉012---All right! All right! It was the best nap ever!
我承认  好吗012---Ah! I said it, okay?
但那都已经过去了  乔伊012---But it's over, Joey!
我想再来一次012---I want to do it again.
我们不能再来一次012---We can't do it again.
为什么   因为那样子太奇怪了012---Why not? Because it's weird!
好吧012---Fine.
你想喝点东西吗012---You want something to drink?
好啊  你有什么  温牛奶跟抗组胺药(帮助睡眠的)012---Sure. What do you got? Warm milk and Excedrin PM.
钱德012---Chandler.
我刚刚才知道你是谁012---Chandler! I just figured out who you are.
你知道我在做什么吗012---Can you figure out what I'm doing?
你是路易斯波森   谁012---You're Louis Posen. Who?
路易斯波森   他是我五年级时最好的朋友012---Lewis Posin!  He was my best friend in fifth grade.
有一天我要他当我男朋友   他拒绝了012---and-and then one day, I asked him to be my boyfriend and he said no.
你知道为什么吗012---Do you know why?
因为他上厕所时  你一直在跟他说话012---Because you kept talking to him while he was trying to go to the bathroom?
不   因为他觉得我太012---No, but because he thought I was too faaaaa...
每次想到这件事   我还是会觉得很难过012---And every time I think about it, I feel as bad as I did in fifth grade!
我真的觉得你该跟茱丽道歉012---Y'know, I-I really think you should apologize to Julie.
甜心  你在开玩笑吗  那是十六年前的事012---Honey, are you kidding? That was like 16 years ago.
如果路易斯能跟我道歉  我会觉得好过一点012---No, I know. But y'know what? It would make me feel better if Louis apologized to me.
好  我会跟她道歉  但我可警告你  这可能会让我变成更棒的男人012---Okay, I'll do it. But I warn you, this may make me a better person.
但那不是你爱上的那个男人012---And that is not the man you fell in love with.
好吧  我们会假设突发状况012---Okay, all right, this is how it's gonna work.
来考验你们当伴娘的资格012---We'll give you hypothetical maid-of-honor situations.
计分范围从1分到10分012---and you will be scored on a scale of one to 10.
1分是最高分  不  10分才是最高分012---One being the highest. No, Ten is the highest.
为什么10分是最高分   因为它是最大的数字012---Why is 10 the highest? Because it's the highest.
好了   瑞秋   你先来012---Okay, Rachel, you're up first.
1号突发状况   你跟摩妮卡在一起012---Situation number one: You're with Monica.
婚礼就要开始了  摩妮卡想临阵脱逃  开始012---The wedding is about to start when Monica gets cold feet. Go!
我不想嫁给钱德012---I don't want to marry Chandler.
我想临阵脱逃  没事的012---I've got cold feet. It's gonna be okay.
跟一个男人共度一生   我不知道我是否办得到012---No, One man the rest of my life? I don't know if I can do it.
这表示我永远都不能跟乔伊上床了012---This means I'll never get to sleep with Joey.
听我说  摩妮卡012---Look, Monica...
临阵脱逃是常见的事012---...getting cold feet is very common.
那是因为你期待过高012---Y'know, It's just because of all the anticipation.
你只要记住你爱钱德012---And you just have to remember that you love Chandler.
我也逃过婚012---And also, I ran out on a wedding.
逃婚的人得退还礼物012---You don't get to keep the gifts.
很好  你引述亲身经验012---Very good, drawing on your own experience.
非常好012---Very good.
没错   很好   瑞秋012---Yes, very nice, Rachel.
谢谢评审012---Thank you, judges.
马屁精  喔012---Ugh, what a kiss ass. Oh.
好了  菲比  是的  大人012---Okay, Phoebe. Yes, Your Honor.
婚礼进行到一半012---We're now in the ceremony.
摩妮卡正要说 "我愿意" 的时候012---Monica is about to say, "I do"...
她叔叔喝得烂醉   开始乱说乱叫012---...when her drunk uncle starts yelling.
你会怎么做  开始012---What do you do? Go!
摩妮卡还小的时候012---When Monica was a little girl...
我记得012---...I remember that
好痛012---Ow!
非常好  喔012---Very good! Oh.
好极了  我给你满分012---Yes, excellent. Perfect score.
等等   她破坏了正在进行中的婚礼012---Wait a minute! She just made a scene in the middle of the ceremony!
嘿   你想尝尝菲比的厉害吗012---Hey, Do you want a little taste of Pheebs?
现在你们得以伴娘的身分  说出对新人的贺词012---It is time for you to give your maid-of-honor speech.
等等  我们还没有准备012---Ohh, wait a minute, We haven't even prepared--
开始   好吧012---Go! Okay, okay, okay. Um...
韦伯斯特大字典   对婚姻的定义是012---Umm, Webster's Dictionary defines marriage as--
好了  不  忘了它  那段贺词太烂了  别在意  忘了它吧012---Okay, no! Forget that! That sucks! Okay, never mind. Forget it. Urn, um...
我遇见我认识的摩妮卡时   她还只是六岁大的小女孩012---I met-I met Monica when we were just a couple of 6-year-olds...
钱德25岁时  我们成了朋友012---...and became friends with Chandler when he was 25...
虽然他看起来  很像六岁大的孩子012---...although he seemed like a 6-year-old.
喔  太好了012---Oh. That’s nice.
谢谢   感激不尽012---Thank you. Thank you very much. Um...
我看过他们单身  跟交往时的样子012---I've known them separately and I've known them together.
我知道他们交往时   深爱着彼此012---and-and to know them as a couple is to know that you are truly in the presence of love.
现在我想举杯012---So I would like to raise my glass...
敬摩妮卡跟钱德012---...to Monica and Chandler...
还有他们要携手共度的  美好冒险历程012---...and the beautiful adventure they are about to embark upon together.
我认为他们做好了万全的准备  要展开这段旅程012---I can think of no two people better prepared for the journey.
哇012---Wow.
说的好  没错  真的很棒012---Great speech. Yeah, it really was.
谢谢012---Oh, thanks.
好了  菲比  下一个是你  虽然我觉得那么做是多余的012---Okay, Phoebe, I guess you're next. Although I really don't see the point.
好吧012---0Kay.
我不敢相信摩妮卡跟钱德要结婚了012---I can't believe that Monica and Chandler are getting married.
我还记得  我跟瑞秋谈过这一天012---I remember talking about this day with Rachel...
那时我们一起冲澡  全身一丝不挂012---...while we were showering together, naked.
这就算她后来居上了012---And she's back in the game!
茱丽   嗨012---Julie. Hi.
我是钱德宾   我猜你还记得我012---Chandler Bing. I guess you remember me.
你好  备胎012---Hello, Skidmark.
那是我的绰号  待会再跟你解释012---It's a nickname. I'll explain later.
我看得出原因012---It's pretty clear.
我很早以前就该跟你道歉了012---I owe you a long-overdue apology.
我不该只因为你很胖  就跟你分手012---I shouldn't have broken up with you because you were overweight.
那是你跟我分手的原因012---That's why you broke up with me?
你不知道啊012---You didn't know that?
看来我的任务已经达成012---Well, I guess my work here is done.
但首先我要说  你们两个都表现的很好012---All right, well first of all, I would like to say you both performed very well,
好吗  你们应该觉得骄傲012---okay? You should be proud of yourselves.
我还想说在这场比赛里  没有人是输家012---And I'd also like to say, that in this competition, there are no losers.
瑞秋除外  该死012---Well, except Rachel. Damn it!
真的吗   我赢了012---Really? I won?
什么   对不起   瑞秋   分数真的很接近012---What? I'm sorry, Rash, it was, it was really close.
那么我要求重新计分   事实上也没有那么接近012---Well, then I demand a recount! Actually, it wasn't that close.
你知道吗   不  不  反正你们的方法太愚蠢了012---No! You know what? No! No! Your thing was so stupid anyway.
我们来丢铜板决定   好吗012---this was ridiculous, We're gonna flip a coin, all right?
正面012---Heads. Oh!
什么  铜板终于原谅我了012---What? The coins have finally forgiven me!
你知道吗  我希望摩妮卡会原谅你   因为你会用012---Well You know what? I hope Monica forgives you after you throw her...
用怪力乱神的素食主义方式   对着她洒花片012---...her vegetarian-voodoo-goddess-circle-y shower.
瑞秋  没关系的  你们帅呆了012---Rach, it's gonna be okay. You guys are the best!
天啊  我得告诉你  当评审真的把我累坏了012---Boy, I tell you. That judging stuff took a lot out of me.
是吗  没错012---Yeah? Yeah.
我想或许我该上楼去   在我的沙发上好好睡一觉012---I was thinking about maybe going upstairs and taking a little nap on my couch.
那关我什么事012---Why would I care about that?
不为什么   我只是说012---No reason. I'm just saying that...
我会在那里012---...that's where I'll be.
虽然结局不如预期中理想   事实上我很满意自己的表现012---As bad as that went, I actually enjoyed myself.
我想我要为我做过的所有蠢事道歉012---I think that I'm going to apologize for all the stupid things that I do.
你为什么不改掉做蠢事的习惯呢012---Why don't you just stop doing stupid things?
那样子你就不必道歉了   我希望可以从两件事起做012---Then you wouldn't have to apologize. I'd love it if I could do both.
好吧   我得问你012---All right, I have to ask.
什么012---What?
如果我变胖了  你会跟我分手吗012---Are you gonna break up with me if I get fat again?
什么012---What?
你跟茱丽分手  她变得有多胖呢012---Well, you broke up with Julie Grath! How much weight could she have gained?
她胖了一百四十五磅012---A hundred and forty-five pounds.
在一年之内012---In one year?
天啊  她吃了什么  她的家人吗012---My God, what did she eat? Her family?
那不是重点012---That's not the point.
我知道那样跟别人分手太蠢了  但当时我才十五岁012---Look I know it was a stupid reason to break up with someone, but I was 15.
对  不只15岁的男孩觉得肥胖是个问题012---Yeah, well, that's not the only time this was an issue.
你还记得  你跟我们一起过感恩节的事吗012---You remember when you spent Thanksgiving with us?
你骂我胖012---You called me fat.
等一下012---Okay. Okay, now wait a minute
那完全是另一回事   怎么说012---That was totally different. How?
你不该听到那句话  我是在你背后偷偷说的012---You were not supposed to hear that. I said that behind your back.
如果我怀孕了呢   我会变得跟现在不一样012---What if I have babies, okay? I'm gonna look different.
我可以接受那样的事   但我不相信你能做到012---I'm okay with that, but I'm not sure you are.
你得了解我不认为   你是个苗条的大美女012---Look you have to realize I don't think of you as a thin, beautiful woman.
我待会儿就会为这种事道歉012---This is one of the things that I can apologize for later.
我是说你是摩妮卡012---What I mean is, you're Monica.
我吗   我爱上的人是摩妮卡012---Okay? And I am in love with Monica.
继续说012---Keep going.
不论你变胖或是变瘦012---So you can balloon up or you can shrink down...
我还是会爱你012---...and I will still love you.
即使我缩小到只有两寸高012---Even if I shrink down to 2 inches tall?
那我会把你放在我的口袋里012---I'd carry you around in my pocket.
我爱你012---I love you.
备胎还是对女人很有一套的012---Skidmark still got a way with the ladies.
嗨   菲比012---Hi, Pheebs.
嗨  嗨012---Hi. Hi.
我来跟你道歉012---I just want to apologize.
我真的很抱歉   我太孩子气了012---I'm really sorry I was a baby.
太可笑了  瑞秋  我们都曾经是小孩子012---That's ridiculous. Rachel, we were all babies once.
你是说今天的事  没错012---Oh, you mean today. Yeah.
对  你知道吗  你应该赢的012---Yeah, and you know, you deserve to win.
我一直在想这件事012---And y'know I was thinking about it.
如果你是摩妮卡的伴娘  那我就是你的伴娘012---If you're Monica's maid of honor, that means I get to be yours.
没错  对012---Oh, yeah. Yeah.
摩妮卡跟钱德订婚时  我收集了一些东西012---When Monica and Chandler got engaged, I put some stuff together.
以防万一   那真的是太好了  谢谢012---y'know Just in case. Oh, that's so sweet. Thanks.
我知道摩妮卡   很喜欢这本诗集012---Here is a book of poetry that I know Monica loves.
天啊   这真是有趣   你看012---Oh, God, this is funny. Look.
这是有一年万圣节   她打扮成新娘的照片012---Here's a picture from one Halloween when she dressed up as a bride.
她要我帮她拉婚纱012---And look, She made me carry her train...
那真的很奇怪   因为我扮的是神力女超人012---...which was weird because I was Wonder Woman.
喔   这是我发现的小包包012---Oh, and here's a little purse that I found.
我想应该可以把婚戒放在这里012---Y'know I just thought that maybe they could hold the rings in there.
喔  还有012---Oh. Something. And...
上好的手帕   因为很多人会在婚礼哭012---...vintage handkerchiefs, you know, because people cry at weddings.
我得拿几条走012---I'm just gonna grab a couple of these.
真是棒极了012---This stuff is great.
我都忘了我把它放在这里了012---I forgot this was in here.
这是我留下来   要在自己婚礼上用的吊袜带012---This was the garter that I was saving for my wedding.
我希望它能成为  被摩妮卡 "借走的东西"012---And I wanted it to be Monica's "something borrowed."
它还是蓝色的012---And it's blue.
对012---Yeah.
瑞秋  我认为你应该当摩妮卡的伴娘012---Y'know Rach, I think that you should be Monica's maid of honor.
真的吗012---You do?
为什么  因为我想这对你来说意义更重大012---Why? Because I think it means more to you.
但菲比  你赢了012---But, Pheebs, honey, you earned it.
没关系   我是说012---It's fine. I mean, this is something...
你从十四岁就想这么做了吧012---...that you've been thinking about since you were, what, 14?
不   那时我才十岁   我发育的很早012---No, I was 10. I just developed early.
我的天啊012---Man alive!
嘿  怎么了  嘿012---Hey, what's going on? Hey!
我们决定由瑞秋来当你的伴娘012---Well, we just decided Rachel is going to be your maid of honor.
真的太棒了012---Oh, that's great!
哇  太棒了  我们得开始计划了012---Oh, wow. Okay, we really have to start planning.
我有很多特别的好点子012---I have, I have really specific ideas.
我们应该一星期开四次会012---We should probably get together like four times per week.
到我家来  我们得在上班前开会012---You can come over to my place, we'll get together before work.
你觉得如何   六点半   我家见   好兴奋012---What do you say, 6:30, my place? So excited!
好吧   你现在笑吧012---Yeah, okay. You laugh now.
她就会是你的伴娘012---but she's gonna be yours.
我睡得好熟012---Great nap.
我也是012---It really was.
老兄  你在做什么012---Dude, what the hell are you doing?
天啊012---God!
失陪了012---Excuse me.
早安   嗨012---Morning. Hi.
昨晚约会还顺利吗012---Hi! Oh, How was your date last night?

天啊  我真的很抱歉012---Aah! My God. Sorry about that.
没事  真的是太棒了012---Okay, really good.
我得走了  我要迟到了012---Anyway I gotta go. I'm late for work.
什么啊  你要把她丢给我012---What-what?! You're going to leave this person with me?
别担心  她真的很棒012---Hey, Don't worry, she's a terrific girl.
你能帮我一个忙吗012---And hey listen, could you do me a favor?
她出来了  你能跟她说我不想定下来吗   谢谢你啊012---When she comes out could you just mention that I'm not looking for a serious relationship? That'd be great.
什么  你在开玩笑吗012---Why?! What, are you kidding?
不经意跟她提起这件事  装做轻描淡写的样子012---Just casually slip it in, you know. Lay the groundwork.
告诉她我是个独行侠  不  我是爱的逃犯012---Tell her uh, I'm a loner. No, an outlaw.
她不会想跟我这种人混在一起012---she doesn't want to get mixed up with the likes of me.
太复杂了012---Y'know what? That's a lot to remember.
我不能直接告诉她你是猪吗012---Can't I tell her that you're a pig?
我会找时间亲自打电话给她012---Hey, I'm gonna call her later myself.
我保证012---Honest.
钱德以前常这么做  他还会做煎饼给她吃012---Oh come on, Chandler used to do it. He'd even make the girl pancakes!
他还会多做几块留给我吃012---Plus, He'd make extras and leave them for me.
算了吧   我什么都不会告诉她   这不是我的责任012---Well forget it, I'm not telling that girl anything. It's not my responsibility.
好吧012---Fine.
那些煎饼怎么办啊012---Now, where did we land on those pancakes?
嗨  嗨012---Hi. Hi.
抱歉   我没办法把门锁上012---Sorry about that, but I couldn't get that lock to work on the door.
没关系  我搬进来时  乔伊就把它弄坏了012---Yeah, Joey kind of disabled it when I moved in.
你一定是瑞秋  我是艾玲  嗨012---You must be Rachel. I'm Erin. Hi.
我不想跟高中女生一样无聊   但他有跟你谈到我吗012---I don't mean this to sound like high school, but did he say anything about me?
你要吃煎饼吗012---Would you like some pancakes?

那是怎么一回事012---What is that?
看起来这两个家伙   真的很喜欢杜威十进分类法012---Sounds like two people are really enjoying the Dewey decimal system.
我们真的很抱歉012---We're so sorry.
你该不会是带我来这里做那档子事吧012---You didn't bring me here to do that, did you?
她又把鸡肉退回来了012---She sent the chicken back again?
她说鸡肉太干  想亲自跟你解释  她要什么样的鸡肉012---She said it's too dry now and she wants to come back here and explain to you how she wants it.
我倒想会会这个鸡肉专家012---Well fine! I'd like to meet this chicken expert.
叫她进来吧012---Send the colonel in.

我很好012---I'm fine.
你手上戴了什么   我看不见了012---Oh, what is that on your finger? I'm blind.
谁是那个幸运的男人012---So who's the lucky guy?
我的天啊012---Oh, my God.
我真的很抱歉   甜心012---I am so sorry, sweetie.
你没事吧012---Are you okay?
你没有告诉她  我们将会结婚吧012---You didn't tell her we were getting married, did you?
她看到戒指了  她被吓到了吗012---She saw the ring. Did she freak out?
她的确被吓了一大跳   但很多人都吓了一大跳012---She was shocked when I told her, but then again, so were most people.
肯定啊012---Right
事实上她也交了男朋友012---Well, She actually has a boyfriend y'know herself.
他叫做克拉克012---Name's Clark.
她还邀请自己来参加我们的婚礼012---She also invited herself to our wedding.
还有克拉克012---Clark too.
你拒绝了她吧012---You said no, right?
你拒绝了她吧012---You said no, right?
她逼得我头晕  还质问我  婚礼是不是在城里举行012---Well, she cornered me. She asked me if the wedding was in town.
我该怎么办   说谎骗她012---I mean, What was I supposed to do? Lie.
那会有多难呢  "你的支票寄出去了"012---How hard is that? "Your check's in the mail."
"你的宝宝好可爱"012---"Oh, your baby's so cute."
"我等不及要看你的书  罗斯"012---"I can't wait to read your book, Ross."
她会来参加婚礼  或许并不是件坏事012---Come on! So she comes to the wedding. Maybe it won't be so bad.
你以为她会安静地坐着   你不认为她会想举杯致词吗012---What do you think she'll sit quietly? You don't think she'll want to make a toast?
你不认为她会想唱 《兼职情人》吧012---You don't think she'll want to grab the microphone and sing "Part-Time Lover"?
我的天啊   她不会喜欢鸡肉  对吧012---Oh, my God. She's not gonna like the chicken that night either, is she?
你知道吗  一定会没事的012---You know what? It'll be okay.
或许她根本不想来012---Y'know what? She's probably not gonna even want to come.
真的吗   不   那是个谎言012---Really? No, that was a lie.
你知道说谎有多容易了吧012---See how easy that was?
所以你会骗她吗012---So you would have just lied?
我会012---Yes.
它真的就那么简单   对012---It would have really been that easy? Yes.
很好  那星期六表演给我看  我们要跟她和克拉克共进晚餐012---Good, so do it Saturday night because we're going to dinner with her and Clark.

乔伊  对不起  我没办法告诉她那些话012---Oh Joey, I'm sorry. I just couldn't tell her all those things you wanted me to tell her.
我们开始聊起天来  我012---And y'know we got to talking, and I--
我们要你娶她012---We want you to marry her.
什么012---What?
她真的很棒   你根本不了解她012---She is so amazing. You have no idea.
不了解   你觉得是谁把她带回来的012---No idea? Who do you think brought her here?
丘比特012---Cupid.
她真的好酷   还会说四种语言012---Joey, she's so cool. She speaks four languages.

听着   她真的是个好女孩012---Look you guys, she's a very nice girl.
我们相处甚欢   但我不觉得我们会有什么结局012---Okay. We had a very good time, but I just I don't see it going anywhere.
你总是那么说012---Yeah, but you always say that.
或许只要你给她一次机会   事情就会变得不一样012---Maybe if you gave this girl a chance, it would go somewhere.
对不起  我真的不那么认为012---Look I'm sorry, you guys. I just don't think so.
随便你  好吧012---Whatever. Fine.

你说什么012---I'm sorry?
学校图书馆收藏了我的博士论文   我跑过去看012---My doctoral dissertation is in the library at school. I went to see it.
发现学生们在古生物学区 "做那档子事"012---And there were students making babies right in the middle of the paleontology section.
我的天啊   你有看到精彩好戏吗012---Oh, my God. Did you get to see anything good?
我问问  你们念书的时候012---Let me ask you something, at your school...
校园里有没有什么地方  是学生会跑去鬼混的012---...was there a like uh a place on campus where students went to fool around?
没错  真的有012---Yeah, there was.
图书馆的角落里  有些书根本不会有人去借012---It was—there the corner of the library where all these dusty books that nobody ever read.
没错  是那里012---Yes, there was.
太棒了  因为大家都会跑到那里去  像是秘密基地一样012---Great, because people kept showing up. I think it's like a thing.
等一下012---Hold on a second.

你好  我想问馆方能不能增加人手012---Hi, I was wondering, if it is possible to increase security...
巡逻古生物学区012---...in the paleontology section?
我写的书放在那里012---I wrote a book that's up there.
但大家去那里不是看书  而是012---And instead of reading it, people are...
他们在我的书面前打滚012---Well, they're rolling around in front of it.
我们知道你提及的问题012---We are aware of the problem you're referring to.
但增加巡逻这件事   恐怕馆方的人力不足012---But as far as increasing security, I'm afraid the library's very understaffed.
我帮不上你的忙012---I can't help you.
好吧012---Well, fine.
如果我是唯一愿意欣赏012---If I'm the only person with any appreciation...
书写文字之美的人  我会亲自去捍卫它012---...of the sanctity of the written word, then I'll go up there and defend it myself.

那你不再生我们的气了  不  你们是对的012---Oh so, you're not, you're not mad at us anymore? No, no. You guys were totally right.
这次比我们第一次约会棒得多012---This is so much better than the first time we went out.
第一次真的很尴尬   我们都很紧张012---Y'know? That was so awkward, We were both nervous.
你们不是上过床了  对  那倒是让我冷静了下来012---Didn't you sleep together? Yeah, that really calms me down.
我们有很多共通点012---And we have so much in common.
她喜欢三明治  运动  虽然她是大都会队的球迷012---She loves sandwiches, sports. Although she is a Met fan.
现在那都不是问题   但如果我们有了孩子012---not much of an issue now, but if we had kids...
我的天啊  你竟然会提到生孩子的事012---Oh, my God! Listen to you talking about having kids.
喔  我的乔伊012---Oh, my Joey.
求求你别比我先结婚012---Please don't get married before I do. Oh.

小到不行012---Uh, Tiny.
我们甚至不知道为什么要举行婚礼012---We're not even sure why we're having it.
事实上我们只会邀请了家人来参加012---It's actually we wants to be just family.
喔   等一下012---Oh, wait.
你们把我当家人看待012---You two think of me as family?
我得问你们一件事   请老实地回答我012---Oh,  I have to ask you something now, and be honest.
你们要我唱《无心呢喃》 还是《红衣女郎》012---Do you want me to sing "Careless Whisper" or "Lady in Red"?
你怎么能那么说   大都会队也好不到哪里去012---How can you say that? The Mets have no closer.
班尼提兹呢   第一场比赛呢012---What about Benitez? What about game one of the Series?
你为什么不闭嘴   你才要闭嘴012---What about shut up? You shut up.
我喜欢跟她吵架012---I love arguing with her.

他真的很棒  我知道  你们希望我们能成功012---Look, he's a really great guy, and I know you really want this to work out...
但我不觉得我们会有未来012---...but I just don't see this having a future.
但你说过你喜欢他   发生了什么事012---But you said that you liked him. I mean what happened?
你改变主意了吗012---Did you just change your mind?
可以那么说   那么快改回来啊012---Kind of. Then change it back!
对不起  我们之间真的没有火花012---I'm sorry. It's just there's no real spark.
没有火花   你们不是都上过床了吗012---No spark? Didn't you sleep together?
是啊012---Yeah.
荡妇012---Ugh, tramp!
乔伊知道吗012---Does Joey have any idea?
我想他不知道   你知道吗012---I really I don't think he does. And you know what?
或许你们可以告诉他  我不想012---Maybe you guys could help clue him in. Y'know, tell him I'm not interested...
认真地跟别人交往012---...in a serious relationship or something.
你是说你是个独行侠012---You mean, like, that you're kind of a loner?
对  那个说法不错012---Yeah, that'd be great.
或许你真的是个淫娃   你说什么012---And maybe that you're a real stronzo. I'm sorry?
我猜你会说的四种语言里   不包括意大利语吧012---Oh well, I guess Italian isn't one of the four languages you speak.
嘿   要走了吗   对啊  我们走吧012---Hey. Want to go? Yeah, let's go.
待会见   再见012---Okay. See you guys later. Bye, guys.
嘿   谢谢你们012---Hey, thank you so much.
我猜不是丘比特把她带来这里的012---I guess it wasn't Cupid that brought her here.
不   只是一个会飞的老矮人012---No, just a regular old flying dwarf.
怎么了   需要我帮忙吗012---Yes, yes. How can I help you?
我们只是四处看看012---Yeah, we were...we were just looking around.
原来你们是爱念书的学生012---Oh, you're-you're fellow scholars.
你们到底在找什么012---What exactly were you looking for?
或许你们想看012---Perhaps--
查斯特史塔克博士012---Perhaps Dr. Chester Stock's musings...
对剑齿虎的研究012---...on the Smilodon californicus?
快滚012---Get out of here!
你来找人吗012---Meeting someone?
还是你想来看看012---Or are you just here to brush up...
玛莉安对进化论的看法012---...on Merriam's views on evolution?

我也觉得玛莉安的观点太先进了012---I find Merriam's views far too progressionist.
对不起  你是哪位012---I'm sorry. Who are you?
我是本校的教授罗斯盖勒012---I'm a professor here. Ross Geller.
罗斯盖勒   为什么那个名字好熟  它是012---Ross Geller? Why do I know that name? It's a...
等一下012---Wait.
这本书是你写的吗012---Did you write this?
对012---Yes.
你就是借走我的书的人012---You're the person who checked out my book?
你跟我想像中完全不一样012---You know, you look nothing like I would have thought.
你好年轻012---You're so young.
我四年级跳级了012---Well, I skipped fourth grade.
我真的很抱歉012---I am very, very sorry.
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
嗨012---Hi.
你们的约会还顺利吗  太棒了  我们在格林威治村散步012---So how was your date? Oh, it was great! We walked all around the village.
还去了冰淇淋店  一起喝一杯奶昔012---We went to this ice cream place. Split a milk shake.
我喝的比较多   但还是很棒012---Seventy-thirty, but still.
我想带她到北区的民宿去过一夜012---And guess what, I'm thinking of taking her upstate to one of those bed-and-breakfasts.
真的吗  她答应了吗012---Really? She said she wants to go away with you?
不  那只是个惊喜  但那有点难  因为她说她的工作实在很忙012---No-no-no-no-no! it's a surprise. but it's gonna be tricky thought because she said she was gonna be pretty busy at work for a while.
好吧  甜心  乔伊  我们得谈一谈  好吗012---Joey, look, honey, we need to talk, okay?
今天她让我觉得012---I got the feeling from her today...
她不想认真地跟别人交往012---...that she's not looking for a serious relationship.
你怎么会那么想   是她告诉我的012---Where are you getting this? She told me.
她说她是个独行侠012---She said she's kind of a loner.
这样012---Oh.
乔伊   嘿   瑞秋  没关系的012---Joey-Hey, Rach, it's cool, you know.
我也是个独行侠  对吧012---I'm a loner too, right?
乔伊   你知道吗   她配不上你012---Hey, Joey. You know what? You are way too good for her.
我发誓下次我会告诉她们   你不想定下来012---Yeah and honey I promise, next time I will just say good-bye and tell them you're not looking for a relationship.
不012---No.
不   别那么做   只要012---No, don't do that. Just...
下次确定她真的喜欢我   对   你说得没错012---Next time, make sure she really likes me. Well, that too.
乔伊012---Joey?
怎样012---Yeah?
你要吃煎饼吗   终于问我了012---Do you want some pancakes? Finally.
我们该怎么办012---What are we gonna do?
我们该选《无心呢喃》012---I say we go with "Careless Whisper."
钱德012---Chandler?
她看到我们了吗  看到我们了吗012---Did she see us yet? Did she see us?
珍妮丝   你来干什么012---Janice, what are you doing here?
我想回我家去012---I thought I was gonna go back to my apartment...
但今晚我不想独处012---...but then I just felt like I really couldn't be alone tonight.
我在想或许我可以待在你们家012---I was just wondering if I could maybe stay here with you.
我真的觉得我该跟家人在一起012---Just I really feel like I need to be with family.
我们的孩子会叫她珍妮丝阿姨  对吧012---Our kids are gonna call her Aunt Janice, aren't they?
拜托   因为我真的不知道   我会做出什么事来012---Please. Because otherwise, I really don't know what I might do.
你不会有点好奇吗012---Aren't you just a teensy bit curious?
你们有面纸吗   有  在浴室里012---You have any tissues? Yeah, in the bathroom.
我们得收留她012---We'll just ...we'll just let her stay.
不  如果我们收留她  她会永远住在这里012---No-no-no-no, If we let her stay, she will stay forever.
就像你的躺椅一样   你真的那么想012---Kind of like your Barcalounger. Is that what you're thinking about right now?
我一直都是那么想012---I never stop thinking about it.
嘿   两位012---Hey, you guys?
你们想上洗手间吗   因为我要洗澡了012---Do either one of you want to get in there before I take my bath?
珍妮丝   对不起012---Janice, I'm sorry...
但今晚你不能留下来012---...but you can't stay here tonight.
为什么012---Why not?
实情吗012---Honestly?
我们家因为电磁辐射的关系012---Our apartment is a hotbed...
遭到了污染012---...for electromagnetic activity.
摩妮卡跟我已经免疫了  但不幸地012---Monica and I have been immunized, but sadly...
你没有免疫力012---...you have not.
我需要一条棉被012---I'm gonna to need a comforter.
你有抗过敏的棉被吗   不然的话我的鼻子会过敏012---Do you have a hypoallergenic one? Because otherwise I get very nasal.
你们养猫了吗   因为我已经开始过敏了012---Do you have a cat? Because it's already happening.
你们听到了吗   你们听012---Eh. Do you hear that? Listen.
我的天啊   你非离开不可了012---Oh, my God! Oh, my God! You have to go.
为什么012---Why?
因为钱德对你还有感觉012---Because Chandler still has feelings for you.
真的吗012---He does?
你说什么012---Say again?
没错  没错012---That's right. That's right.
所以今晚你不能留下来012---And that is why you can't stay here tonight.
或许你都不该来参加婚礼012---And probably why you shouldn't come to the wedding.
感觉  很强烈的感觉012---Feelings. Such strong feelings.
我是说我知道他对你的感觉   永远都不会完全消失012---I mean, I realize that his feelings may never completely go away...
但你应该消失012---...but you can.
我的天啊012---Oh, my God.
我懂了  真的很抱歉012---I understand. I am so sorry.
我会离开的012---I'll go.
再见  摩妮卡012---Goodbye, Monica.
我祝你跟他永远幸福快乐012---I wish you a lifetime of happiness with him.
钱德012---Chandler.
如果你们相处得不好   就打电话给我012---You call me when this goes in the pooper.
别紧张  这片区由我来负责012---Don't sweat it, I've got this section covered.
事实上我会拿着手电筒   照别人的眼睛012---Yeah, in fact, I've got this baby to shine in people's eyes.
好吧  待会见012---Okay, see you later.
我只是带摩妮卡来看你的书012---I just wanted to show Monica your book.
大家好  感恩节快乐  嘘嘘012---Hey, everybody. Happy Thanksgiving. Shh.
不让大家知道  今年有感恩节吗012---What, are we keeping Thanksgiving a secret this year?
不是  我们正在玩一个游戏012---No, we're playing this game I learned at work.
你要在六分钟内  写出美国各州州名012---You have to name all the states in six minutes.
这个啊   太容易了012---What? That's, like, insanely easy.
事实上这个游戏很难   你总是会漏掉一个012---No, it's harder than it sounds. You always forget at least one.
某些人会漏掉  十四个012---Or in some cases, 14.
这太蠢了  我没有跟任何人玩012---It's a stupid game and I wasn't playing against other people...
所以技术上来说我没输012---...so technically, I didn't lose.
你忘了十四州的州名012---You forgot 14 states?
没有人在乎南北达科他州012---Nobody cares about the Dakotas.
好了  时间到012---Oh, okay, time's up.
好了  我写出四十八州012---All right, I got 48.
还不错  菲比呢012---Oh, that's not bad. Pheebs?
我厌倦写州名   所以决定写出各种芹菜的名字012---Oh, I got tired of naming states, so I decided to list the types of celery.
我写了一个  普通芹菜012---And I have one, regular celery.
好   瑞秋写出四十八州   菲比在蔬菜名称方面012---Okay, so Rachel's got 48 and Phoebe has the lead in...
称霸  乔伊呢012---...vegetables. Joey?
跟钱德的愚蠢州名游戏新冠军打声招呼吧012---Say hello to the new champ of Chandler's dumb states game.
哇   你写了几个   五十六个012---Wow, how many you got? Fifty-six.
老友记  第七季  第8集  钱德不爱狗012---Friends S07E08  The One Where Chandler Doesn't Like Dogs
新英格兰为什么不是一个州012---Hey, how is New England not a state?
他们有运动代表队012---Huh? They have a sports team.
南奥勒冈有运动代表队吗012---Does South Oregon have a sports team?
对啦012---There you go.
为什么多了一付餐具012---How come we have one extra place setting?
你邀了你的助理过来  对了  抱歉  秦格不来了012---Because you invited your assistant. Oh, right, sorry. Tag's not coming.
他女朋友来了  所以他得去陪她012---His girlfriend came into town, so he's spending Thanksgiving with her.
你为什么没有告诉我012---Oh, why didn't you tell me'?
我帮他做了专属的  番薯酿南瓜012---I made him his own individual sweet potato stuffed pumpkin.
我本来想说   但我想012---Oh, well, I was going to, but then I figured, you know...
你做的菜既好吃  又好看012---...your food is so delicious and perfect...
我想多吃一点你做的南瓜012---...you can never have too many of those pumpkin things.
你这话太假了  你以为我会相信  不过我还是觉得听着很高兴012---You'd think I wouldn't enjoy that because it is so fake, ha, ha, but I still do.
普通芹菜012---Regular celery.
我已经写了012---Oh, I already have that.
好了  时间还剩下很多012---Done, with time to spare.
这可能是新世界记录   我讨厌对你们说教012---Ooh, this may be a new world's record. You know, I hate to lecture you guys...
但这真的是太丢脸了  一群受过良好教育的成年人012---...but it's kind of disgraceful that a group of well-educated adults...
跟乔伊  无法写出全部的州名012---...and Joey, can't name all the states.
你们看过地图  或是圆圆的色彩鲜艳叫做"地球仪"的东西吗012---You ever see a map or one of those round colorful things called a globe?
麦哲伦先生  你只答对了四十六州012---Uh, Magellan? You got 46 states.
什么   不可能   四十六州012---What? That's impossible. Forty-six.
那个受过良好教育  写不出剩下十州州名的人是谁012---Well, who's well-educated now, Mr. I-Forgot-Ten-States?
烤箱太满了  我要借乔伊的烤箱012---I'm out of oven space. I'm gonna go turn on Joey's.
拜托   看好他   别让乔伊偷吃东西012---Please, watch him. Do not let Joey eat any of the food.
我只有一个人012---I am only one man.
好了   时间到   再给我1分钟012---Okay, time is up. Give me another minute.
如果现在想不出来   你永远都想不出来   好吗012---Ross, if you don't know them by now, you will never know them, okay?
那就是这个游戏好玩的地方   它会让你想要杀了自己012---That is the beauty of this game. It makes you want to kill yourself.
太疯狂了   我一定答得出来012---This is crazy. I can do this.
好吧   我敢说我能在晚饭前写出五十个州的州名012---All right, uh, I bet I can get all 50, uh, before dinner.
好吧   但你写不出来就不能吃晚饭012---Okay, but if you can't, no dinner.
就这么说定了012---You're on.
别偷看我的答案   里面有很多你写不出来的州名012---All right, don't look at my list, because there's a lot on there that you don't have.
你知道你的烤箱坏了吗012---Hey, did you guys know your oven doesn't work?
可装满外送菜单的抽屉   没坏吧012---But the drawer full of takeout menus is okay, right?
罗斯   我要借用你的烤箱012---Ross, I'm gonna use yours, okay? Shh.
钱德   快来帮我012---Chandler, give me a hand.
乔伊   别让罗斯偷看地图或你家的地球仪012---Sure. Joey, do not let Ross look at any maps or the globe in your apartment.
别担心   那又不是美国的地球仪012---Don't worry, Chandler. It's not a globe of the United States.
嘿   我要去散个步012---Hey, you guys, I'm gonna go out and take a walk.
菲比  你的包包为什么在动012---Phoebe, why is your bag moving?
没有啊   它真的在动012---Oh, it's not. Seriously, it's moving.
里面装了什么东西   就是我编织的东西而已012---What the hell's in there?  It's just my knitting. That's all.
对   我织了这个012---Yes, I knit this.
我真的很厉害012---I'm very good.
罗斯的公寓很漂亮  为什么我们从不来这里混012---Ross' apartment is nice. Why don't we hang out here more often?
我不知道   或许是因为它有个怪味道012---I don't know. Maybe because it smells weird.
有点像是放了很久的南瓜味012---It's like old pumpkins or something.
那是我的派   这个味道好香012---That's my pie. Which smells delicious.
哇啊哦  怎么了012---Uh-oh. Uh-oh. What?
我们让乔伊跟食物独处了012---We left Joey alone with the food.
没错   我就知道012---Yep, yep, I knew it.
他在012---There he is...
拿馅料喂小狗吃012---...feeding stuffing to a dog.
你好  这里是盖勒及宾的家  有什么事吗012---Hi, Geller-Bing residence. How can I help?
菲比   为什么我们家会有狗012---Phoebe, why is there a dog in our apartment?
对不起   你是谁012---I'm sorry, who's this?
菲比  有只狗坐在我的沙发上012---Phoebe, there's a dog sitting on my couch.
告诉她我对狗过敏   我会告诉她的012---Tell her I'm allergic, and I will sue.
这里没有狗  不  真的有012---No, there's no dog here. Yes There is.
他是黑白相间   而且毛很长012---He's black and white and shaggy.
他就坐在瑞秋旁边  正在舔她的手012---He's sitting next to Rachel and licking Rachel's hand.
我的天啊   你在哪里012---Oh, my God. Where are you?
我马上回去012---I'll be right there.
他们已经回来了  怎么这么快啊012---They're here already? How are they doing this?
嗨  泰格  你来这里做什么012---Hi, Tag. What are you doing here?
我想知道你的邀请   是不是还有效012---I, uh, wanted to see if your offer to spend Thanksgiving with you was still good.
当然有效   快进来吧012---Well, sure. Come in.
你女朋友呢012---Well, what happened to your girlfriend?
今天早上我们分手了012---We, uh, kind of broke up this morning.
我很遗憾   所以她回俄亥俄去了012---Oh, I'm sorry. Yeah, so she went back to Ohio.
俄亥俄州  谢谢你012---Ohio, thank you.
狗在哪里012---Huh. Where's the dog?
什么狗  这里没有狗012---What dog? There's no dog here.
那只狗离开了012---Yeah, that dog left.
菲比012---Phoebe.
菲比   快开门012---Phoebe, open up.
房间里没有狗012---There's no dog in here.
菲比   我们听到了狗叫声了012---Phoebe, we can hear the dog barking.
不   那只是我的咳嗽声012---No, that's just me coughing.
很好  你们回来了012---Oh, good. There you are.
听着  我房间里有只狗012---Listen, urn, I have a dog in my room.
他在这里做什么012---What is it doing here?
我帮我朋友照顾他   他们有事出城去了012---I'm watching it for friends who went out of town.
等一下012---Wait.
嗨  我是克朗克012---Hello, my name is Klunkers.
我可以跟你们这些大好人住在一起吗012---May I please stay with you nice people?
我也希望能留他住下来   但钱德对狗过敏012---Oh, I wish he could stay here, but Chandler's allergic.
我对狗严重过敏   好吗012---Extremely allergic, okay?
只要我一靠近狗   超过五分钟012---If I am anywhere near a dog for more than five minutes...
我的喉咙就会紧缩012---...my throat will just close up.
真是奇怪   这只狗在这里住了三天012---That's odd, because this dog's been living here for the past three days.
真的吗012---Really?
如果他在这里住了那么久012---If the dog has been here that long...
你一点反应都没有   或许你对他不会过敏012---...and you haven't had a reaction, maybe you're not allergic to this dog.
他还是得离开   好吗012---Well, it still has to go, right?
为什么012---Why?
好吧   我   别那么做012---Okay, it's, um-Don't do it.
别做什么   我非说不可012---Don't do what? I have to.
好吗   时间到了012---Okay? It's time.
好吧   我讨厌狗012---Okay, I hate dogs.
什么   太疯狂了  为什么012---What? That's crazy. Why?
我早跟你说过了012---Told you.
他们很黏人012---They are needy...
爱乱跳   你不知道他们在想什么012---...they are jumpy, and you can't tell what they are thinking...
那样子把我吓得半死012---...and that scares me a little bit.
你说的对  他们很可怕012---You're right. They are scary. Aah!
他吃掉了放在我手上的点心012---She just ate a treat out of my hand!
等一下  你不喜欢所有的狗   连小狗都不喜欢吗012---Wait a minute. Do you not like all dogs? I mean, not even puppies?
这里有小狗吗012---Is there a puppy here?
你不喜欢小狗  喂  你是新来的012---You don't like puppies? Okay, you are new.
听着   钱德   我跟你说过  别跟其他人说你不喜欢狗012---Look, Chandler, I told you. Never tell anyone about this dog thing.
这就像罗斯不喜欢冰淇淋一样012---It's like Ross not liking ice cream.
你不喜欢冰淇淋   它太冰了012---You don't like ice cream? It's too cold.
狗也让我觉得很不舒服012---Okay, it's just that dogs make me a little uncomfortable.
我的牙齿冰得好痛012---Hurts my teeth.
我不想这么说   不希望你们讨厌我012---I don't wanna say this. I don't want you guys to hate me...
但我不喜欢这只狗  待在我身边  好吗012---...but, uh, I don't think I can be around that dog anymore, okay?
不是那只狗走   就是我走012---So either the dog goes or I go. Huh.
我的天啊012---Oh, my God.
我怎么可能答不出来012---How can I not get this?
我是大学教授  SAT了考了1450分012---I'm a college professor. I got 1450 on my SATs.
是1250分才对012---Twelve fifty.
该死   我忘了你在这里012---Damn, I forgot you were here.
好吧  我们得把克朗克送到罗斯家012---All right. We're gonna take Klunkers to Ross'.
马上就回来012---We'll be back in a minute.
等一下  你们离开前  我能问你们一个问题吗012---Oh, wait, before you go, can I ask a question?
如果一个男人跟女朋友分手了012---Um, when a guy breaks up with his girlfriend...
我得等多久才能采取行动012---...what is an appropriate amount of time to wait before you make a move?
我想是一个月012---Oh, I'd say about a month.
真的吗   我觉得是三到四个月  半小时012---Really? I'd say three to four. Half-hour.
真有趣012---Interesting.
但他是你的助理   我劝你别那么做012---When it's your assistant, I would say never.
好了   瑞秋  问题是他喜欢你吗012---All right, Rach, the big question is, does he like you?
如果他不喜欢你   这样做只是在对牛放屁012---Right? Because if he doesn't like you, this is all a moo point.
对牛 "放屁"012---Huh. A "moo" point?
对  牛不知道你做了什么012---Yeah. It's like a cow's opinion.
那不重要012---It just doesn't matter.
那是在 "放屁"012---It's "moo."
是我跟他同居太久   还是他的话真的有道理012---Have I been living with him for too long, or did that all just make sense?
别听乔伊的   好吗   看看他的样子012---Please don't listen to Joey. Okay? Would you look at him?
他很沮丧   家人又不在身边012---He's obviously depressed. He's away from his family.
他在跟陌生人过感恩节012---He's spending Thanksgiving with strangers.
现在他需要你这个朋友012---What he needs right now is for you to be his friend.
你说的对  对不起  谢谢012---Oh, you're right. I'm sorry. Thank you.
好吧  我会那么做的  很好  照她们的话去做012---Okay, that's what I'm going to do. Fine, take their advice.
反正没有人会听我的话012---No one ever listens to me.
只要包装好看  没有人会在乎内容012---When the package is this pretty, no one cares what's inside.
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
你还好吧012---How you holding up?
还可以  是吗012---Not bad. Yeah?
关于你女朋友的事我很遗憾   谢谢012---I'm sorry about your girlfriend. Thanks.
你们在一起很久了吗   一年了  总是分分合合的012---Were you guys together a long time? A year, on and off.
我以为我们会相守一生   现在我不会那么想了012---I thought we'd end up together. I don't anymore.
因为她跟你分手了   对012---Now that she broke up with you. Yeah.
这真的很奇怪012---Hmm. It's weird.
我以前总以为我会遇见一个人  坠入爱河  过着幸福的生活012---I always used to assume that I would meet someone and fall in love and be happy.
好像很自然而然  最近我会想如果不是那样呢012---That all that was just a given. Well, lately, it's like, what if it's not?
你有那种感觉吗012---Do you ever have that feeling?
不012---No.
有012---Yeah.
我常有那种感觉  一直都有  真的很可怕012---All the time. Constantly. It's terrifying.
但后来我想通了  一定会发生的012---But, you know, then I figure it has to work out.
为什么012---Why?
因为一定会的012---Because it has to.
你真的什么都知道  对吧  没错  我真的什么都知道012---You have all the answers, don't you? Yeah, I know, I do. I really do.
谢谢你陪我聊  别这样  这不是上司的工作吗012---Hey, thanks for talking to me. Come on, what are bosses for?
快来抱一下吧012---Hug it out.
好了  他也喜欢你012---All right, he likes you back.
我说过你该表白的012---Huh? Told you you should go for it.
什么012---What?
下面的噪音有没有盖过那句话012---Street noise drown any of that out?
没有吗  待会见  好吧012---No? All right, I'll see you later. Ha, ha. Okay.
刚刚乔伊说了什么   我也喜欢你012---What did Joey say? I like you back?
你知道的   他012---Uh, yeah-You know, well, see, he...
乔伊知道  我对我的背没信心012---Joey knows that I'm very insecure about my back.
刚刚你在抱我012---And... And you were hugging me...
很明显地   你不讨厌它   没错012---...so obviously you are not repulsed by it. Yeah. Heh.
等一下   那样根本说不通012---Wait a minute, that doesn't make any sense.
是吗012---No?
好吧   事实是这样的012---All right, here's the truth. Ahem.
乔伊会那么说012---Joey said what he said because, urn...
因为我被你吸引012---...I'm attracted to you.
对   我承认012---Wow. Yeah, I admit it.
我暗恋你  我知道那很疯狂  因为我们是同事012---I have a crush on you. And, uh, I know that's crazy because we work together...
我们之间不该发生任何事012---...and nothing could ever happen.
我一点都不想吓到你012---And the last thing I wanted to do was freak you out...
或是让你觉得不自在012---...or make you feel uncomfortable.
所以我认为  你最好快说句话012---Which is why it would be really great if you said something right about now.
我的天啊   那些家伙在偷我的车012---Oh, my God. Those guys are stealing my car.
什么   就在那边   那是我的车012---What? Right there. That's my car.
嘿   好了  他们得花点时间012---Hey! Okay, that's gonna take a minute.
你有话要跟我说吗012---Do you have anything else you wanna get off your chest?
我不敢相信012---I can't believe this.
我们还有时间谈   他们还没上车012---Wait, we still have time to talk, and they're not even in the car yet.
你看  他们上车了012---Oh, look, there they go. Okay.
好了  菲比   或许我们该回去了012---Okay, Phoebe. We should probably go back now.
求求你   别离开我   我会很寂寞的012---Please, don't leave me. I'll be lonely.
停了  别说了012---Stop it. Stop.
我们走吧   我们可以很坚强的   好吧012---Okay, let's go. We can be strong. Yeah, okay.
天啊   你听到了吗    他在叫 "摩妮卡"012---Oh, my God, did you hear that? She said "Monica."
我不能丢下他012---Oh, I can't leave her.
我们可以偷偷把狗带回去  钱德不会发现的012---If you want, we could sneak the dog back in and Chandler wouldn't even know.
那样怕是不行的012---That's not gonna work.
我把小狗藏在房间里三天了   钱德完全不知道012---I had that dog there for three days and Chandler had no idea.
他没有那么聪明012---He's not so smart.
嘿  我也不知道012---Hey. I didn't know either.
对  但是你觉得怪怪的  对吧012---Yeah, but you kind of knew that something was going on, didn't you?
没错   我知道012---Yeah, I knew. Heh.
钱德在哪里012---Where's Chandler?
我在这里   快去洗手012---Here I am. Wash your hands.
你怎么知道012---How did you know?
他怎么又回来了012---Hey, what's she doing back here?
别激动   罗斯   他不是冰淇淋做的012---Relax, Ross. She's not made of ice cream.
听着  菲比  我按照位置将各州州名排好了012---Hey, look, Phoebe. I, uh, laid out the states geographically.
没时间谈这事了012---No, no, we don't have time for this.
我们不能让钱德靠近我房间012---We have to keep Chandler away from my room.
对   但是012---Yeah, but, look what I--
所以我们没有时间了012---See, this is exactly what we do not have time for.
摩妮卡在哪里  她在菲比房里  你不能进去012---Where's Monica? Uh, in Phoebe's room. You can't go in.
为什么012---Why not?
摩妮卡在哭012---Monica's crying.
关于克朗克的事   她非常难过012---She's very upset about this whole Klunkers thing.
我应该进去的  不012---Well, I should go in there. No, no.
不   现在她不想见你012---No, she doesn't want to see you right now.
为什么   因为你把那只狗赶走了012---Why not? Because you sent away the dog.
太可笑了  是吗012---That's ridiculous. Oh, is it? Is it?
听着   小时候摩妮卡跟我养了一只狗叫路佛012---Look, when Monica and I were kids, we had a dog named Rover.
有一天  我爸决定不再喜欢狗了012---And, um, one day, my dad decides he doesn't like dogs.
摩妮卡跟她的朋友菲丽丝012---So Monica and her friend...Phyllis...
把狗送走  那是我们最后一次见到他  好吗012---...take away the dog, and that was the last time we ever saw him.
你懂吗  这次也一样012---Don't you see? This is just like that...
只不过有些细节不一样012---...only with a few details changed.
好吧   我换了运动裤012---Okay, I'm in my sweatpants.
把食物端上来吧012---Bring on the food.
怎么了   摩妮卡因为012---What's the matter? Monica's all upset...
克朗克的事很难过012---...because I sent Klunkers away.
所以呢  就把狗抱回来了  你会成为大英雄的012---So? Bring the dog back. You're a hero.
对  我可以当大英雄  我可以那么做  可以012---Yeah, I could be a hero. I could do that. I could. I could do...
万一他攻击我呢012---What if it--? What if it attacks me?
钱德   他就像只大沙鼠012---Chandler, it's like a big gerbil.
你不害怕吗012---And that doesn't scare you?
罗斯   需要帮忙吗012---Ross, you need some help?
你要帮我忙012---From you?
好的   拜托你了012---Yes, please.
首先   犹他州012---First of all, Utah?
兄弟   你不能乱编州名012---Dude, you can't just make stuff up.
我恨美国012---I hate America.
游戏结束后   我发誓我要搬家012---When I finish this game, I swear I am moving.
嘿   泰格还在跟警察谈   对012---Hey. Tag still talking to the police? Yeah.
该死   我为什么要说话012---Ugh, damn it. Why did I open my mouth?
"我暗恋你   我被你吸引"012---"I have a crush on you. I'm attracted to you."
我知道   我吓坏他了012---I know that I freaked him out.
如果你是那种口气  他一定吓坏了012---If you said it like that, you probably did, yeah.
嘿   钱德在吗012---Hey, is Chandler here?
不在   他去散步了012---Uh, no, no, he went for a walk.
好了  你们不能告诉他啊   看看是谁回来了012---Okay, well, you cannot tell him, but look who's back.
嗨   喔   不  不012---Hi. Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
他去罗斯家把小狗带回来了012---He went over to Ross' to bring the dog back here.
不  不  小狗不在那里呀012---Oh, no, the dog's not going to be there.
你这么觉得啊012---You think?
嗨   甜心012---Hi, honey.
求求你  别对我生气012---Please, please, please, don't be mad at me.
什么   为什么   等着瞧吧012---What? Why would--? Shh. Wait and see.
或许我们会   或许我们不会012---Maybe we will, maybe we won't.
我跑到罗斯家   想帮你把克朗克抱回来012---Okay, I went over to Ross' apartment to bring back Klunkers, you know, for you...
我忘了关门   他一定是跑出去了012---...and, ahem, I left the door open, and she must've gotten out.
我到处都找过了   找遍了整栋公寓   包括屋顶012---And I looked everywhere, all over the apartment, including the roof.
对了  罗斯  你邻居在屋顶上种大麻012---Which, FYI, Ross, one of your neighbors, growing weed.
我找不到他012---I couldn't find him...
我真的很抱歉012---...and I am so, so, so sorry.
但我知道  怎么样能让大家忘记痛苦012---But I do know where we can all go ease the pain.
我们有好消息   看看谁回来了012---We have good news. Look who's back.
嗨012---Hi.
克朗克   我的天啊012---Klunkers. Oh, my God.
没错   他是自己跑回来的   这是感恩节的奇迹啊012---That's right. She came back all by herself. It's a Thanksgiving miracle.
真高兴能见到你012---It is so good to see you.
他从罗斯家跑了回来012---Yeah, she came all the way back from Ross' building.
他一定遇到了很多事012---Oh, the things she must've seen.
他爬上消防梯012---Then she climbed up the fire escape...
用他的小脚拍打窗户012---...and she tapped on the window with her teeny little paw...
我们跑去开窗让他进来012---...and we ran to let her in.
我说的太过火了   对吧012---I went too far, didn't I?
我该在哪里就住口呢012---When should I have stopped?
好了  或许这个游戏很难  是因为美国没有五十州012---Okay, maybe this is so hard because there aren't 5O states.
我得告诉你一件事  我写出四十九州的州名012---Let me tell you something. I have 49 states.
很全的答案了012---Now, there are no more.
我想我应该可以吃点东西了012---Now, I think I should be able to eat something.
随便你012---It's up to you.
嗨   你还好吗   我很好012---Oh, hi. How are you doing? I'm okay.
我得到警局去  指认嫌犯的照片012---I gotta go down to the police station and look at mug shots.
谢谢你们邀请我来这里   秦格  你要走了吗012---Thanks for having me over, you guys. Tag, you're going? Uh...
我们还没有机会好好谈一谈012---We didn't, uh, get a chance to talk.
你说你是哪一州的人012---So where did you say you're from again?
科罗拉多州   你真是没用012---Colorado. Ah, what good are you?
听着  我想我们该谈谈   在阳台上发生的事012---Look, urn, I think we should talk about what happened on the terrace.
好吧012---Okay. Uh...
我不该说那些话的012---I never should've said what I said.
我的感觉并不重要012---You know what? It just doesn't matter how I feel.
我们一起工作   不应该有任何私人关系012---We work together, so nothing could really ever happen between us.
星期一我想高高兴兴去上班   再也不提这件事了012---What I would love is just to go to work on Monday and never talk about this again.
好了  星期一是个大日子  我们还有很多事要做012---Okay? Big day, Monday. Lots to do.
我们应该还好吧012---So we okay?
我一点都不好012---Um, I'm not.
我就知道   我吓到你了   不   你没有012---Oh, God, I knew it. I freaked you out. No, you didn't.
吓坏我的反而是012---The only thing that freaked me out was you saying...
你说我们之间不该有关系012---...that nothing could happen between us.
真的吗   对012---Really? Yeah.
请不要因为我这么做   就炒我鱿鱼012---So please don't fire me for doing this.
星期一我们得做的事少了一件012---Okay, well, that's one less thing we have to do on Monday.
德拉瓦州012---Delaware.
德拉瓦州012---Delaware.
好吧   我要吃我的火鸡012---All right. I want my turkey now.
没问题012---You got it.
你重覆写了两次内华达州012---You got Nevada twice.
我知道   好吧012---I know. Yeah.
我准备好了012---I'm ready.
你确定012---You sure? Uh-huh.
好  让我帮你把头盔戴好012---Okay, let me just straighten out your helmet there.
谢谢你  爸爸  不  一个爸爸  二个妈妈012---Thanks, Daddy. No, no. One daddy, two mommies.
好了  你去吧  没问题012---All right, it's all yours. Okay, okay.
加油  加油012---There you go, there you go.
这是小班第一次骑脚踏车   我真的是好兴奋012---Wow, Ben's first big kid's bike. This is so exciting.
对  我还记得我的第一次012---Oh, yeah, I remember mine.
是我六岁的生日  我爸带我到公园去012---It was my sixth birthday. My dad took me to the park...
刚坐上脚踏车  它就垮了  没错012---...and I got on it and...it bent. Yeah.
我从来就没有属于自己的脚踏车  什么012---I never had a bike of my own. What?
我们家很穷012---Well, we didn't have a lot of money.
但住在对街的女孩  有一辆最酷的脚踏车012---But the girl across the street had the best bike.
是粉红色的  把手挂着五颜六色的流苏012---It was pink and it had rainbow-colored tassels hanging off the handle grips...
还有铃铛   一个白色的大篮子012---...and-and-and a bell, and this big, white wicker basket...
上面黏着塑胶做的小雏菊012---...with those plastic daisies stuck on.
听起来很像是我的第一辆脚踏车012---That sounds like my first bike.
我爸把他以前的脚踏车送给了我012---My dad gave me his old one.
那个女孩让你骑吗   不012---Did the girl ever let you ride it? No.
但她把装脚踏车的纸箱送给了我012---But she gave me the box that it came in.
纸箱前面印了脚踏车的图案012---It had a picture of the bike on the front.
我可以坐在上面  我继父会拖着我在后院跑012---So I would sit on it and my stepdad would drag me around the backyard.
真的太不公平了012---That is so unfair.
也不能那么说   我也会拖着他跑012---Not really, I got to drag him around too.
老友记  第七季  第9集  糖果皇后012---Friends S07E09  The One With All The Candy
嘿  你们在做什么012---Hey, what are you guys doing?
我在为邻居做糖果012---Making holiday candy for the neighbors.
对不起  你说谁012---I'm sorry, who?
我要在门上挂一个篮子012---I'm gonna hang this basket on the door.
只要邻居一走过去   就可以拿一块糖果012---and when the neighbors walk by, they can all take a piece.
但我们不认识我们的邻居   我认识啊012---But we don't know the neighbors. I do.
让我想一想   那个留胡子的男人012---There's, uh, let's see, the guy with the mustache...
老烟枪婆婆   我看过一些孩子012---...smokes-a-lot lady, some kids I've seen...
还有红头发的男人  他不喜欢别人叫他小红012---...and the red-haired guy who does not like to be called Rusty.
看吧   这就是我要做糖果的原因012---See, this is exactly why I'm making this candy.
这样可以知道他们的名字来认识邻居012---We can learn their names and get to know our neighbors.
搬家应该会比较简单一点吧012---Wouldn't it be easier if we just moved?
早安012---Good morning.
有人心情不错啊   我为什么要心情不好012---Ah, somebody's in a good mood. Well, why shouldn't I be?
我有很棒的朋友   有很棒的工作012---I have great friends. I have a wonderful job...
而且可以在办公室跟助理鬼混012---Where you can make out with your assistant.
少来啊  那也没什么大不了的012---Come on, it's not a big deal.
我们整晚没睡  都在想计划012---We stayed up all night coming up with a plan...
确保我们的交往不会有问题012---...so that us dating will not be a problem.
是吗  你们想出了什么计划012---Oh, yeah? What's the plan?
我们  我们不会012---We-We are not...
让它012---...going to let it...
变成问题吧012---...be a problem.
你们花了一整晚   想出那个计划012---Wow. It took you all night to come up with that plan?
你知道的  我们还做了别的事012---Oh, well, you know, we did other stuff too.
你们两个012---Did you two...?
喔  莫尼卡  我不会在第一次约会时就跟男伴上床012---Oh, Monica come on, you know I don't sleep with guys on the first date.
麦特威尔  马克林恩   班韦斯  我已经不会了012---Matt Wire, Mark Lynn, Ben Wise. Anymore.
秦格  今天我要开会  对吧012---Hi, Tag, um, I have a conference call today, is that correct?
没错  4点开会   谢谢你   没事了012---Yes, at 4. Okay, thank you, that'll be all.
等一下  等一下012---Wait, wait.
你看到了吗012---Did you see that?
他没发现我们在谈恋爱012---That mail guy had no idea there was something going on between us.
我得回去工作了  好吧   工作狂012---I'd better get back to my desk. Okay, you hard worker!
我会在你的评估表里提到那一点012---I'll remember to put that in your evaluation.
我哪一点   你已经来上班两个月了012---My what? You've been here for two months now...
你的上司必须为你的表现做个评估012---...and your boss is required to hand in a performance evaluation.
但你知道吗  有一件事  我至今还没有做评估012---But you know, there is one thing that I have yet to evaluate.
你是认真的吗  不  我一直都想那么做012---Are you serious? No, I've just always wanted to do that.
你可以帮我把东西捡起来吗012---Can you help me clean this up?
篮子是空的  天呐  邻居们把糖果都吃掉了012---The basket is totally empty. My God, the neighbors ate all the candy.
喔  不然的话就是012---Well, either that or, uh...
乔伊012---Joey.
什么事012---Yeah?
你吃掉给邻居们的糖果了吗   本来我打算要那么做的012---Did you eat all the neighbor candy? Uh, well, yeah, that was the plan.
但是我走到篮子边时   发现里面就只剩几块糖果了012---But by the time I got to it there was only a couple of pieces left.
整天人潮川流不急   他们喜欢的不得了012---Yeah. They've been coming by all day. They love it.
他们喜欢我的糖果012---They love my candy?
天啊   我得多做点了   嘿   摩妮卡012---Oh, man, I gotta go make more. Hey, Mon.
多做一点千层面  因为有人可能吃了一大块012---you might wanna make some more lasagna too. because something might have happened to a huge chunk of it.
罗斯  我的邻居吃光了我的糖果012---Ross, the neighbors ate all my candy.
我的邻居偷走我的报纸012---Mine stole my newspaper.
这简直就是犯罪潮012---It's like a crime wave.
菲比  你有空吗012---Pheebs, you, uh, got a second?
当然有  嗯012---Sure. Yeah.
从你告诉我  那个脚踏车的故事后012---Ever since you, uh, told me that story about that bike...
它一直就在我脑中挥之不去012---...I couldn't stop thinking about it.
我是说大家都该有第一辆脚踏车  你知道吗  所以012---I mean, everyone should have a first bike, you know? So...
我的天啊   罗斯012---Oh, my God, Ross.
你喜欢吗   我爱死它了012---You like it? I love it.
是吗   喔  天啊012---Yeah? Oh. Oh, God...
我爱你012---And I love you. Ah.
不是那一种爱012---Not that way.
但这辆脚踏车   让你跟我更亲近了012---But the bike got you a lot closer. Oh.
这样  把它拿到楼下去012---Well, uh, take it downstairs.
试骑一下012---You know, give it a test drive.
好的  我的天啊012---Okay. Oh, my God.
我的第一辆脚踏车012---My first bike.
谢谢你   这是我收过的最棒的礼物012---Thank you for the best present I've ever gotten.
别客气012---You're welcome.
钱德都快哭了012---Oh, and Chandler's about to cry.
我才没有012---Am not.
是谁012---Who is that?
别担心  我很勇敢  我很勇敢  我我很勇敢012---Don't worry, I'm brave. I am brave. I-I am brave.
不  不  不012---No, no, no, no, no.
请问你是谁012---Can you tell me who is there, please?
我是盖瑞   我住在楼上012---My name's Gary. I live upstairs.
嗨  嗨012---Hi. Hi.
你知道现在几点了吗   现在是糖果时间012---Do you know what time it is? It's candy time.
我室友说它们吃起来   就像是天上掉下来的礼物012---My roommate says that they taste like little drops of heaven.
喔  拜托012---Oh, please. Heh.
你听到了吗   "天上掉下来的礼物"012---Did you hear that? "Little drops of heaven."
凌晨4点012---Four a.m.
你能给我一点糖果吗012---So can I get some candy?
对不起   我们之中还有人得早起去上班012---I am sorry, but some of us have to get up early and go to work.
他不知道我不是 "那个人"012---He does not know that I am not "some of us."
对不起  但明天一大早我会做一些糖果012---Um, listen, I'm sorry, but I'll put some out first thing in the morning.
那好吧   我待会儿再来拿012---Well, okay, I'll swing by later.
你住在这里012---You live in this building? Mm-hm.
我应该会记得你012---Mm. Seems like I would have remembered you.
晚安   盖瑞012---Mm. Night, Gar.
你看了你的评估表吗012---So did you read your evaluation yet?
没有  上面写了 "极机密"012---No, it was marked "confidential."
我刚刚把它送到人事处了012---I just sent it down to Human Resources.
拜托  你是在开玩笑  对吧  我故意写那份评估表来跟你开玩笑012---Okay, please, you're kidding, right? I wrote that one as a joke for you.
他们会喜欢这个玩笑吗012---A joke they would appreciate?
我想不会012---I'm thinking no.
你写了什么   我说你是个接吻高手012---What did you say? Um, I said that you were a good kisser...
我喜欢你又小又挺的屁股012---...and, uh, that I liked your your tiney-tiny touchie.
不  你不该那么说012---No, not my touchie.
还有更糟糕的事012---Well, it gets worse.
关于你的主动性   我写012---When asked if you take initiative, I wrote:
"他几乎不需要指导  就能解开我的胸罩"012---"Yes, he was able to unhook my bra with minimal supervision."
至于你的表现会不会有问题  我写  "天啊  希望不要有"012---And under problems with performance, I wrote, "Dear God, I hope not."
然后然后我画了一个微笑的小脸012---And then, uh-And then I drew a little smiley face.
还有一张色情小素描012---And then a small pornographic sketch.
罗斯  你送菲比脚踏车真的太贴心了012---Ross, that is so sweet of you to get Phoebe that bike.
我听到那个故事  差点就哭了012---When I heard the story, I almost cried.
你差点哭了012---Almost cried, huh?
你听到了吗   钱德  "差点"哭了012---Hear that, Chandler? "Almost" cried.
只要有人提到《铁达尼号》  你每次都会哭012---Hey, you cry every time somebody talks about Titanic.
他们两个只有彼此012---Those two had only each other.
菲比真的很喜欢它吧012---Phoebe really likes the bike, huh?
对  我看到她带着它过街012---Oh, yeah. I saw her walking it down the street the other day.
车篮子里面还有花   真的很可爱012---She had these flowers in the basket. It was so cute.
今天早上我还看到她   带着它在公园里散步012---Yeah, I saw her this morning walking it by the park.
等等   她带着脚踏车  两次都是012---Wait a minute, she was walking the bike? Both times?
嗨  菲比  嗨012---Hey, Pheebs. Oh, hi.
你喜欢脚踏车吗   非常喜欢012---Hey, so you enjoying the bike? Oh, uh-huh, so much. Heh.
菲比  你会骑脚踏车吧012---Pheebs, you, uh-You do know how to ride a bike, don't you? Heh.
当然会012---Of course.
我们能看看你骑脚踏车吗012---Can we see you ride it?
好吧012---0Kay.
看到了吗012---See?
我早就跟你说过了   不要跟助理交往012---This is why I told you never get involved with your assistant.
只要是地下情   绝对是纸包不住火的012---And there's no such thing as keeping secrets when it comes to having affairs.
你听到了吗   钱德012---Did you hear that, Chandler?
纸是包不住火的012---No such thing.
发生了什么事   我只是在吃糖果012---What happened? I'm just eating candy.
或许没有那么糟糕   他们可能看不懂我的意思012---Maybe it's not as bad as I think. Y'know, maybe they didn't take it the way I meant it.
当然   你知道吗   因为"小屁屁"可以指屁股012---Absolutely, you know? Because "tushy" can mean both ass...
或者是好员工012---...and good worker.
我得把评估表拿回来012---Ugh, I just gotta get the thing back.
瑞秋   还记得你提到的素描吗012---Rach? That sketch you mentioned?
它跟这素描很像吗012---Might it have looked a little something like this?
我的天啊   乔伊012---Oh, my God, Joey.
你是怎么了  天啊012---What is the matter with you? God.
在我买不起色情杂志前   这点天份还蛮有用的012---Boy I tell ya, this little talent came in handy before I could afford porn.
嗨   对不起  我知道现在是休息时间  但我真的需要糖果012---Hi, I'm sorry. I know it's after hours, but I really need candy.
对不起  我帮不了你  看到了吗  没规定就是规定012---I'm sorry, I can't help you. See? Rules are rules.
拜托  我住在外地的朋友  今天来看我012---Please, I have people coming from out of town today.
我跟他们提起你的糖果   开玩笑吧012---I told them all about your candy. No kidding,
他们是外地来的   你怎么跟他们说的012---Out-of-towners, huh? Heh. What did you tell them?
我告诉他们你的糖果   真的是好吃到无法形容012---I told them your candy was absolutely indescribable.
有人说它是 "天上 掉下来的礼物"  但那不重要012---Well, some people have been saying it's "little drops of heaven," but whatever.
拜托   你不能帮帮我吗  钱德   我们认识那位女士吗012---Please, can't you help me out? Hey, Chandler, do we know that lady?
可能吧  她不是住在你楼下做爱时会大叫的那个女人吗012---Maybe. Isn't she the woman who lives below you and has sex really loud?
好吧   我只破例一次012---All right, I'll do it just this Once.
但你不能告诉任何人  好  求求你  快给我吧012---But you can't tell anybody. Yes, yes, please, just give it to me.
对  就是她012---Yeah, that's her.
谢谢你  不可思议012---Thank you. Unbelievable.
我不敢相信纸条居然没有用012---I can't believe that sign didn't work.
你知道怎么才会有用吗   别再做糖果了012---You know what would work? Stop making candy.
但他们喜欢它012---But they like it.
你是说他们喜欢你012---You mean they like you.
或许吧012---Maybe.
那就是你当厨师的原因   你要大家喜欢你012---Is that why you became a chef, so that people would like you?
你要跟我谈怎么让别人喜欢你吗   小丑012---Heh. You want to talk about getting people to like you, huh, funny man?
记住我教你的一切  你会没事的012---Okay, now, just remember everything I taught you and you'll be fine.
好吗  开始吧012---Okay? Here we go.
就位  预备012---Ready, set--
等一下   这个座垫真的很不舒服012---Wait, this seat is really uncomfortable.
不如先换掉再来练习012---Maybe before we start we should just get another one.
或许我们该换个飞机座椅  或懒骨头012---Perhaps like an airplane seat, or a beanbag chair.
菲比  你不能逃避这件事  你得学会骑脚踏车012---Phoebe, you can't get out of this, okay? You have to learn how to ride a bike.
为什么  为什么我非学不可012---Why? Why do I have to learn?
以防发生紧急事故  什么样的紧急事故012---Well, in case of an emergency. What kind of emergency?
如果有人走过来   拿枪抵着你的头说012---Well let there—what if a man comes along and puts a gun to your head and says:
"快骑上脚踏车  不然我会012---"You ride this bike or I'll--
我会开枪打你"012---I'll shoot you."
我会按铃铛分散他的注意力012---Okay. I would ring the bell to distract him...
然后我会用中国飞镖   把那个家伙敲昏012---...and then I would knock the gun out of his hand with a Chinese throwing star.
好吧   菲比  快坐上脚踏车012---Okay, Phoebe, just get on the bike...
我会扶着你   推你  好吗012---...and, hey, I'll hold you up and push you. Okay?
你不会放手012---You won't let go?
我不会  你发誓012---No. You swear?
我发誓012---I swear.
好吧   来吧012---Okay. Come on.
好了  要开始了  好吗   好吧012---Here we go. All right? All right? All right.
感觉不错吧   好了  试着踩踏板012---Feel good? All right, try pedaling.
对了  做的好  对  控制住车子012---That's it, you're doing great. Yes, take control.
这就对了  嘿012---Yes, yes, yes. Whee! Hey!
喔  不012---Oh, no.
你发过誓的012---You swore.
我认为你骑得很好了  我真的很震惊012---I just thought you were doing so well. I am shocked. Shocked.
大家都是那样子学脚踏车的012---It's a legitimate learning technique.
嘿012---Hey.
外面有些人在问糖果的事012---There's, uh, some people outside asking about candy.
他们得等  好吗  我只有两只手012---Well, they're just gonna have to wait, aren't they? I only got two hands.
需要我帮忙吗  不  你不熟悉流程012---Need some help? No, you don't know the system.
我不希望任何人破坏我的流程012---I don't need nobody messing with the system.
还有  你结婚前一个星期  不会常常看到我012---By the way, the week before your wedding, you may not see a lot of me.
嗨  骗子012---Oh, hello, liar.
听着  我真的很抱歉  放开了你的脚踏车012---Look, I'm really sorry I let go of the bike.
我可能会没命的012---I could've been killed, I hope you know.
我知道  我知道012---I know, I know.
但你能再试一次吗012---But can we please try it again?
我是说  你只差一点就成功了  菲比012---I mean, you were so close, Phoebe.
喔  我很乐意012---Well, I would love to...
但脚踏车被偷了  警察找不到嫌犯012---...but the bike got stolen and the police have no suspects.
菲比  什么012---Phoebe. What?
怎么会这样012---What the hell?
好  你知道吗012---All right, you know what?
如果你不学骑脚踏车  那么我很抱歉012---If you are not going to learn how to ride this bike, then I'm sorry...
我得把它收回去  什么  为什么012---...I'm just gonna have to take it back. What? Why?
因为  因为它012---Because. Because it's...
它就像你买了这把吉他012---It'd be like you having this guitar...
却从来不弹它012---...and never playing it.
好吧  这把吉他希望被弹012---Okay, this guitar wants to be played.
这辆脚踏车希望被骑012---And this bike wants to be ridden.
如果你不骑它012---And if you don't ride it...
你就是在扼杀它的灵魂012---...you're killing its spirit.
脚踏车012---The bike...
快死了012---...is dying"
好吧  如果你真的那么在乎不惜撒下漫天大谎  我学就是了012---All right. If you care enough to make up that load of crap, okay.
太棒了012---Great.
你让脚踏车非常快乐012---You're making the bike very happy.
知道啦  罗斯012---Okay, Ross.
请不要死掉012---Please don't die.
我们得在他们看到评估表前  把它拿回来012---Okay, I think we can get the evaluation back before they see it.
所以我们得溜进塞纳的办公室   通常他十点才会到012---We have to get into Mr. Zelner's office. Now, he doesn't get in until 10, so he's no problem,
但他的助理贝蒂   一大早就会到办公室吃早餮012---But his assistant, Betty, comes in early to eat her breakfast at her desk.
那真的很悲惨   没错  贝蒂有点惨012---That's kind of sad. Yeah, well, Betty's kind of sad.
所以我相信我可以用这些巧克力把她诱开012---Which is why I believe I can lure her away with these chocolates.
我诱开她后   你就跑进去012---Now, while I distract her, you go in the office.
知道了  行动吧012---Got it. Let's roll.
嗨   瑞秋  你有空吗012---Hello, Rachel. You, uh, got a minute?
当然  塞纳先生  你有事吗   我随时都有空012---Yeah, sure, Mr. Zelner. For you? Anything. Minute.
好吧   太棒了012---Okay, great.
取消计划  取消计划012---Abort the plan. Abort the plan.
事实上  我想跟你们两个谈一谈012---Uh, actually, I'd like to speak to both of you.
好的012---0Kay.
有什么事需要帮忙吗  塞纳先生  或许你想吃点巧克力012---Uh, well can we, can we get you anything, Mr. Zelner? Maybe some chocolates?
不  谢谢你  但我可以把它们送给贝蒂012---Um, no, thanks, but I'll give these to Betty.
我看过你对泰格做的评估表012---So I read your evaluation of Tag.
或许我该叫他的全名  泰格"小可爱"琼斯012---Or, uh, to use his full name, Tag "Sweet Cheeks" Jones?
你们之间有什么吗012---Is something going on with you two?
我的天啊   你能想像如果有  会怎么样吗012---Oh, my God, can you imagine if there was?
如果是那样的话  会怎样012---I mean, what would happen exactly?
那样啊   我一定得写份报告012---Well, I'd be forced to file a report.
我得跟法律部门商量012---I'd have to consult with the legal department.
你们在公司的未来  可能会有问题012---And your future at the company would be in jeopardy.
喔  塞纳先生012---Well-Uh, Mr. Zelner...
那份评估表是我写的012---...I'm the one who filled in that evaluation.
喔  不  对  对  对012---Oh, no-Yeah, yeah, yeah.
我以为这样会很好玩012---I thought it would be funny.
你写着你有可爱的小屁屁012---You wrote that you have a cute tushy?
对012---Yes.
我的幽默感很奇怪012---I have a weird sense of humor.
很奇怪地   我以自己的屁股为荣012---And I'm kind of strangely proud of my butt.
开这种玩笑太危险了  秦格012---It's kind of a risky joke, Tag.
这到底是在画的什么   我看不懂012---And what is-what is this drawing? I can't figure out what this is.
它倒过来了  你知道吗  那不重要012---You're looking at it upside down-You know what? It doesn't matter.
我不是没有幽默感的人012---Hey, it's not like I don't have a sense of humor, huh?
没错  我甚至很喜欢写挑逗性的打油诗012---Hell, I even enjoy a naughty limerick every now and then.
但时间跟地点是很重要的012---But there's a time and a place, huh?
除非你有写打油诗的灵感012---Unless you, uh, have a limerick right now.
没有吗  好吧   你知道我的传真机号码012---No? Okay. Well, uh, you've got my fax number.
我不敢相信你会那么做   那太贴心了012---I can't believe you did that. That was really sweet.
别担心  你可能会丢掉工作012---Ah, don't worry about it. No, you could've lost your job.
你在开玩笑吗  有这么可爱的屁股  我一定能找到工作012---Are you kidding me? With a cute butt like this, I'd find work.
谢谢你   你太棒了012---Thank you, you're great.
你知道吗   什么012---You know what? What?
我感觉棒极了012---I feel great.
事实上012---In fact...
什么012---What?
我只是我花了很多时间才把桌子整理好012---It's just-It took me so long to get that desk organized.
对不起012---I'm sorry.
这就对了012---There it is.
怎么了012---What is going on?
我们在等糖果   把糖果拿出来012---We're waiting for the candy. Bring out the candy.
对  小姐   快给我们糖果012---Yeah, lady, give us candy.
乔伊012---Joey.
什么事   兄弟   你在做什么012---What's up, buddy? What are you doing?
我在等着拿糖果012---Waiting to get candy.
快进来012---Get in here.
嘿   你不能在这里抽烟012---Hey, and you cannot smoke in here.
圣诞快乐012---Merry Christmas.
糖果做好了  我得让它冷却15分钟012---Okay, guys, the candy is coming. I just need 15 minutes for the chocolate to cool.
好了  大伙们  安静  安静  请闭嘴012---All right, everybody, just be quiet. Be quiet. Be quiet. Pipe down.
你们是怎么了012---What is the matter with you people?
这个女人在为你们做好事012---This woman was trying to do a nice thing for you.
她想做糖果  是为了要认识你们012---She was making candy so she could try to get to know all of you...
我敢说你们没有人   能叫出她的名字012---...and I'll bet that not one of you can tell me her name.
我没说错吧012---Am I right?
她是糖果小姐012---Candy Lady?
不  不是 "糖果小姐"012---No, not "Candy Lady."
知道她的名字就能拿到糖果吗012---Hey, if we know it, can we have candy?
好吧   你们知道吗012---All right, you know what?
忘了糖果  你们毁了一切  毁了一切012---Forget it. All of you, forget it. You've ruined it.
回家去吧  你们毁了一切012---Go home. You've ruined it. You've ruined it.
那是不对的  你们毁了一切  你们毁了这个机会012---That's all wrong. You guys ruined everything. You ruined it.
谢谢   别客气012---Thank you. You're welcome.
你抽了烟吗012---Did you smoke?
不  老烟枪婆婆  把烟直接喷入我的嘴巴里012---No, smokes-a-lot lady blew smoke directly into my mouth.
你没事吧012---Uh, are you okay?
我没事   但刚刚真的有点可怕012---I'm fine now, but it was really scary there for a while.
有人将恐吓纸条   塞到门缝下012---I mean, someone slipped a threatening note under the door.
对了  我很抱歉  我受到暴动状态的影响012---Oh, yeah. Sorry about that. Mob mentality or whatever. I don't know.
我不敢相信  我办到了  我会骑脚踏车了012---I can't believe it. I did it. I rode a bike.
我从来没想过我能这么做   谢谢你  罗斯012---I never thought I'd be able to do that. Thank you, Ross.
嘿  别谢我  谢谢你自己012---Oh, hey, don't thank me. Thank yourself.
是你面对了自己的恐惧   终于克服了它012---You're the one who faced your fears and ultimately overcame them.
别说些陈腔滥调的话  又不是《我的这一班》012---Don't be so corny, Ross. It's not an After School Special.
再见012---Bye-bye.
我在米雪餐厅订好位子了012---I just got reservations at Michelle's...

菲比  嗯012---Pheebs? Uh-huh?
骷髅头012---Skull?
是啊  是我妈的012---Oh. Yeah, it's my mom's.
我的天012---Oh, my God!
不  不  不  不是我妈012---No, no, no. It's not my mom.
是属于我妈的012---It belonged to my mom.
她以前每次圣诞节都会拿出来012---She used to put it out every Christmas...
让我们记得即使是圣诞节  人还是会死的012---...to remind us that even though it's Christmas, people still die.
还可以放糖果在里面012---And you can put candy in it.
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
吃糖012---Licorice?
好啊012---Sure.
今年班和我起过节  太好了012---Hey, I just found out, I get Ben for the holidays this year. That's great!
你要扮成圣诞老公公吗   不要012---Are you gonna dress up as Santa? Nope.
我知道苏珊每年都会这么做012---I mean, I know Susan does every year.
可是今年  我想教他了解光明节012---but I think I want to take this year to teach him about Hanukkah.
也许我能教班012---And maybe I could teach Ben...
有关圣诞骷髅头和人怎么死亡012---...about the Christmas skull and how people die.
你可以在今年教班认识菲比012---You may need to use this year to teach Ben about Phoebe.
嘿012---Hey.
你知道他在里面吗  不知道012---Did you know he was in there? No.
我们回来多久了  大概半小时012---How long have we been home? About half an hour.
好极了012---Lovely.

你知道我在想什么  我们结婚后  你要不要012---You know what I was thinking? When we get married, will you, uh...
改冠夫姓 "宾"012---...change your name to "Bing"?
不要012---No.
为什么不要012---Why not?
"宾" 很奇怪012---Bing's weird.
你们好   嗨012---Oh, hey, you guys.
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
猜猜怎么着了012---Guess what?
我房东刚通知我   我的房子快好了012---My landlord just called. My apartment's gonna be ready soon.
所以我很快就会搬出去了012---I guess I'll be moving out.
菲比  我会想念你的012---Aw, Phoebe, I'm gonna miss you.
是啊  你会很伤心012---Yes, you will be very sad.
我要告诉瑞秋这个好消息  你们还住一起吗012---I gotta go tell Rachel the good news. Oh. You'll be living together again?
是啊  为什么不呢   她和乔伊住得很开心012---Why not? Well, she's just so much fun with Joey...
我以为她还会   继续和他住在一起012---...I assumed she'd still be living with him.
为什么你认为她和乔伊住得很开心呢012---Why do you think she's having so much fun living with Joey?
没为什么   只不过她是012---No reason, except she...
这么跟我说的012---...told me.
真的她说了  她不和我住012---She said she didn't want to live with me?
没有  她没这么说012---No. No, she didn't say that.
我想你该和摩妮卡说说了012---I think you should talk to Monica now.
菲比  别担心  我确定她想和你住的012---Phoebe, don't worry about it. I'm sure she wants to live with you.
你确定你很肯定012---You're absolutely sure?
不  我打赌她大概会012---No, but I'll bet she probably does.
大概012---Oh, probably?
我不喜欢这个词012---I don't like that word.
我知道 "大概"真正的意思  是啊  是啊012---I know what "probably" really means. Yeah, uh-huh, yeah.
"你妈大概不会自杀"012---"Oh, your mom probably won't kill herself."
对不起  我不要把我和瑞秋012---You know. I'm sorry, but I'm not hanging my hopes...
住在一起的希望寄托在 "大概"上面012---...of Rachel and I living together on "probably."
人在这世上要自己照顾自己012---Y'know? You gotta take care of yourself in this world.
历史教训完全没用012---History teaches us nothing.
"宾" 现在不是那么奇怪了吧012---Bing doesn't seem so weird now, does it?
嘿  太好了  你在家012---Hey! Great, You're home.
猜猜菲比送我什么圣诞礼物012---Guess what Phoebe got me for Christmas?
鼓  不是  鼓012---Drums? No, drums!
嗨  请给我们两个墨西哥卷外带012---Hi, Could we get two burritos to go, please? Ha, ha.
抱歉  不过也没那么抱歉  因为你不用和他在一起生活012---I'm sorry. But not that sorry, you don't have to live with it.
我们用钱德宾的名字订了位子012---Um, we have a reservation under the name Chandler Bing.
好的  大约要等45分钟012---Okay, we'll have a table for you in about 45 minutes.
45分钟   我们《音乐人》的票是8点的012---Forty-five minutes? We have tickets to The MusicMan at 8.
抱歉   圣诞节是最忙的时候012---I'm sorry. Christmas is a very busy time, sir.
难道是因为墨西哥卷玩笑吗012---Is this because of the burrito thing?
你要给他钱  给他钱  那只是个玩笑而已012---You need to give him money. Give him money? It was a joke!
不  为了我们的位子  这种地方都是死要钱的012---No, to get a table! Places like this are always shaking you down.
每个人都要小费的   好吧   镇静下来012---Everybody wants to be paid off. All right, calm down, O'Malley.
我会塞些钱给他  可是你要不露痕迹012---I'll slip him some money. You've got to be smooth about it.
嘿  我可以不露痕迹012---Hey, I can be smooth.
听着  我们有点赶时间  如果能让我们早一点012---Listen, we're a little bit in a hurry, so, if you could get us a table...
排到位子  我会很感激的012---...a little quicker, I'd appreciate it.
当然  先生  好012---Of course, sir. Okay.
怎么样了   钱还在另一只手里012---How'd it go? Had the money in the wrong hand.
你会不会012---Hey, ahh, You don't feel...
想吐  会不会  不会012---...like you're gonna throw up? No.
我会  所以我们012---Well, I do. So let's...
班   你012---So, Ben, you, uh...

圣诞夜012---Christmas Eve.
对  但012---Yes, but also...
光明节也是012---Hanukkah!
你是一半犹太人  光明节是犹太人的节日012---See, you're part Jewish and Hanukkah is a Jewish holiday.
圣诞老公公有会飞的麋鹿012---Santa has reindeers that can fly.
对  但在光明节012---Right, urn, but on Hanukkah--
光明节是庆祝一个奇迹012---Hanukkah is a celebration of a miracle.
很多年前   有一群人叫做玛加伯人012---Years and years ago there were these people called the Maccabees.
好  对  是的012---Okay, that's right. Yes...
但在光明节  我们唱的是012---...but on Hanukkah, we sing, uh:
好  这不是在比赛012---Ha, ha. Okay, it's not a contest.
圣诞老公公什么时候来012---When is Santa coming?
这样好不好  今年我们不要圣诞老公公012---Well, how about this year, instead of Santa...
我们来庆祝光明节012---...we have fun celebrating Hanukkah?
没有圣诞老公公012---No Santa?
我不乖吗012---Was I bad?
不  不  你没有不乖  你今年很乖  班012---No, no, no, you weren't bad. You've been very good, Ben.
圣诞老公公生我的气  不是  嘿  嘿012---Santa's mad at me. No, hey, hey, come on.
班  圣诞老公公没有生你的气  好吗012---Ben, Santa is not mad at you, okay?
你是他最喜欢的小孩012---You're his favorite little guy.
所以圣诞老公公会来嘛012---So Santa's coming?
对012---Yes!
圣诞老公公会来的012---Santa's coming.
很简单   保持轻松012---It's easy. Just keep it casual.
说句好话  和他握手  塞钱给他012---Give him a kind word, Shake his hand and give him the money.
你怎么这么了解   我不知道012---How do you know so much about this? I don't know.
理查以前常这么做   是不是012---Richard used to do it, didn't he?
我们现在可能已经在喝汤了012---We'd be eating our soup right now.
可恶的小胡子012---Mustached bastard.
这些人刚走  快  给他钱拿座位号012---Okay, those people just left. Come on. Quick, give him the money and get their table!
对不起012---Excuse me.
我们赶时间   可不可以012---We're in a bit of a hurry. Can we please...?
你喜欢鼓啊012---So you like the drums.
真好012---That's great.
我本来还担心它们会造成012---Y'know, I was worried that they would create maybe...
你们之间无法忍受的居住状况012---...an unbearable living situation.
好吧  看来没有  好012---But, okay, well, apparently not. So, yay!
菲比  我们学会了一首歌012---Hey, Pheebs, check it out, we already learned a song.
准备好了1  2  3  4012---Ready? One, two, three, four.
塔奇拉012---Tequila!
真好玩012---That's fun.
来了012---Here you go.
谢谢  阿甘  放在这里012---Thank you, Gunther. Put her there.
用铜板就没有那么容易了012---Definitely not easier with coins.
谢谢  谢谢012---Thank you. Thank you.
菲比  嘿012---Hey, Pheebs. Hey.
给你  现在我只欠你49块半了012---Here. Now I only owe you $49.50.
菲比  嘿012---Hey, Pheebs. Hey.
如果你要送乔伊毁掉整栋楼的圣诞礼物012---If you want to get Joey a Christmas present that disrupts the entire building...
何不送更微妙一点的012---...why not something a little bit more subtle...
像是铁锤012---...like a wrecking ball...
或是把天花病毒散播在走廊上012---...or a vial of smallpox to release in the hallway?
不只是鼓的声音  每5分钟012---It's not just the drum noise. Every five minutes...
乔伊把鼓棒丢到空中012---...Joey throws his sticks in the air...
然后我就会听到  "喔  我的眼睛  天哪  我的眼睛"012---...and I have to hear: "Oh, my eye! Oh, God, my eye!"
烦死人了  对  谢谢你012---I mean, it's so annoying. Yes, thank you.
你看  这是正常人对鼓的反应012---You see, this is how normal people are supposed to react to drums.
菲比  你送乔伊鼓是为了烦瑞秋012---Phoebe, You got Joey drums to annoy Rachel...
好让她不想继续住在那里吧012---...so she wouldn't want to live there anymore?
可能有一点012---Maybe on some level.
乔伊  你知道你不用丢鼓棒的012---Joey, y'know that you could just not throw the sticks up in the air.
那样怎么能算是玩摇滚乐呢012---What is rock 'n' roll about that?
嘿  乔伊  送你另外一个礼物012---Hey, Joey, I got you another present.
等一下   先不要告诉我是什么012---Okay wait, Before you tell me what it is...
好  是什么012---Okay, what is it?
是一只012---It's a...
毒蜘蛛012---...tarantula!
天啊  瑞秋  抱歉  我在想什么012---God, Rachel, look, I'm sorry. What was I thinking...
送乔伊这么一个   恶心的  可怕的蜘蛛012---...giving Joey this big, gross, scary spider...
还用这么一个松散的笼子012---...in such a poorly constructed cage?
你在说什么啊   我喜欢012---What are you talking about? I love them.
我小时候就有一只   后来我的猫咪吃掉了它012---I had a tarantula when I was a kid. But it-it died, because my cat ate it.
然后猫咪也死了012---And then my cat died.
乔伊  这不是很酷吗012---But, Joey, isn't this cool?
在我身上吗  我觉得他在我身上  我012---Is it on me? I feel like it's on me. I got--
不是很可爱吗012---Oh, isn't that adorable?
乔伊怕蜘殊012---Joey is afraid of the tarantula. Oh.
他好可爱哟012---Ah, yeah, He's so adorable.
老天  他很好玩012---He's so much fun.
乔伊是最棒的  很高兴你在这里住得很开心012---Joey is the best, I'm glad you're having so much fun here.
什么   等一下012---What? Wait-wait a minute,
菲比  怎么回事012---Phoebe, What's the matter?
我们的房子好了012---Our apartment is ready.
你不高兴是因为012---And that makes you angry because...?
因为你很想和乔伊住在这里012---Because you'd rather live here with Joey.
你为什么这么想呢   摩妮卡和钱德012---Where did you get that? Monica and Chandler...
说你和乔伊住得很开心012---...said you were having so much fun here...
而且不管是鼓还是毒蜘殊   都不会改变这点012---...and apparently no amount of drums or tarantulas is gonna change that.
菲比  你送乔伊这些东西012---Phoebe? Did you get all this stuff for Joey...
是想让我不住这里吗012---...to try to drive me out of the apartment?
亲爱的  那你还不如送他一条鱼012---Honey, if you wanted to do that, you might as well just gotten him a fish,
你知道我有多怕鱼012---You know how fish freak me out.
鱼012---Fish.
这些都不重要  菲比  我们会住一起的012---It wouldn't have mattered anyway, Phoebe, you and I are, are gonna live together.
我们是室友  讲好的012---We're roommates, that's the deal.
对  可是我希望你想和我一起住012---Yes, but I wanted you to want to live with me.
可是  如果你在这里住得这么开心012---But okay, if you're having so much fun over here--
喔  和你在一起更开心012---Oh. It's so much more fun with you.
我们住一起时很开心  对不对  对啊012---We did have fun, didn't we? We did.
好玩的不得了  他们说如果我们想的话  今晚可以去看012---Oh, anyway, they say if we want, we could see it tonight.
好啊  好  好012---Oh, I would love to. Yay, okay!
好  好  好012---Good, good, good. Great. All right. Good.
摩妮卡要我让鼓声停止012---And Monica asked me to make the drumming stop.
好了012---Done.
嗨012---Hey.
你好  先生  要退还那件裤子吗012---Hello, sir. You here to return those pants?
不   这是我的裤子012---No, these are my pants.
喔012---Oh.
好吧012---0Kay.
需要什么   还有没有圣诞老公公衣服012---How can I help you? Um, do you have a Santa outfit left?
圣诞节前两天   抱歉012---Two days before Christmas? Sorry, man.
好吧  有没有什么算是比较圣诞节的东西012---Okay, look. Do you have anything, uh, Christmas-y?
我答应了儿子   不想让他失望012---I promised my son, and I really don't want to disappoint him.
拜托   你们一定有什么吧012---Um, come on, I…uh, you gotta have something.
我是佳节犰狳（哺乳动物）012---I'm the Holiday Armadillo!
我是圣诞老公公的朋友012---I'm a friend of Santa's...
他要我来祝你012---...and he sent me here to wish you...
圣诞快乐012---...a merry Christmas!
圣诞老公公怎么了  佳节犰狳（哺乳动物）012---What happened to Santa, Holiday Armadillo?
圣诞老公公没有空012---Santa was unavailable...
在这么接近圣诞节的时候012---...so close to Christmas.
请进   请坐012---Come in, have a seat.
你一定累坏了吧   大老远从德州跑来012---You must be exhausted, coming all the way from Texas.
德州  对   班012---Texas? That's right, Ben.
我是圣诞老公公的012---I'm Santa's representative...
西南州代表012---...for all the Southern states.
还有墨西哥012---And Mexico!
圣诞老公公要我来这里012---But Santa sent me here...
送礼物给你   班012---...to give you these presents, Ben.
或许这位小姐可以帮我拿礼物012---Maybe the lady will help me with these presents.
哇  谢谢012---Wow, thanks!
不客气   班012---You're welcome, Ben.
圣诞快乐012---Merry Christmas. Ooh.
还有光明节快乐012---And happy Hanukkah!
你也为光明节而来吗   因为我是一半犹太人012---Are you for Hanukkah too? Because I'm part Jewish.
你是  我也是012---You are? Me too.
因为犰狳（哺乳动物）是在沙漠里晃荡012---Because armadillos also wandered in the desert?
你想在走廊里晃荡吗012---You want to wander in the hall?
嘿  班012---Oh. Hey, Ben!
何不让节日犰狳（哺乳动物）012---What if the Holiday Armadillo...
跟你说光之节的故事好吗012---...told you all about the Festival of Lights?
酷012---Cool!
来吧   班012---Come on, Ben.
很多年以前012---Years and years ago...
有一群人  叫做012---...there were these people called...
玛加伯人012---...the Maccabees!
呵呵呵  圣诞快乐012---Ho-ho-ho. Merry Christmas!
圣诞老公公012---Santa!
嘿012---Hey.
你来干什么   圣诞老公公012---What are you doing here, Santa?
我来看我的老朋友班012---Well, I'm here to see my old buddy, Ben.
你在这儿干什么012---What are you doing here...
怪乌龟人012---...Weird Turtle Man?
我是节日犰狳（哺乳动物）012---I'm the Holiday Armadillo...
你的半个犹太人朋友012---...your part-Jewish friend.
你要我来送礼物给班012---You sent me here to give Ben some presents.
记得吗012---Remember?
什么012---What?
圣诞老公公   你有带礼物给我吗012---Did you bring me any presents, Santa'?
当然有  班012---You bet I did, Ben.
放在这里012---Put her there.
如果不是他的手太小   这次会成功的012---Well, it would have worked this time if his hands weren't so damn small.
呵呵呵012---Ho-ho-ho.
班  来开礼物012---Ben, why don't you come open more presents.
圣诞老公公   节日犰狳和我要在厨房里谈一谈012---Santa, the armadillo and I have a little talk in the kitchen.
我绝对想不到会说出这句话012---There's a sentence I never thought I'd say.
你在干什么012---What are you doing?
你告诉每个人说   你找不到圣诞老公公衣服012---You called everyone and said you were having trouble finding a Santa costume...
所以我向同事借了一件012---...so I borrowed one from a guy at work.
谢谢  可是你必须离开012---Thank you, but you gotta leave.
为什么  因为012---Why? Because...
我终于让他对光明节有兴趣了012---...I'm finally getting him excited about Hanukkah...
而你却正在破坏012---...and you're wrecking it.
可是我还没摇摇我的肚子呢012---But I didn't get to shake my belly like a bowlful of jelly.
抱歉   钱德   这对我很重要012---I'm sorry, Chandler but this, but this is really important to me.
好   我去还了这套衣服012---Fine, I'll give the suit back.
嘿   你可以再多借一晚上吗012---Hey, you think you can keep it another night?
圣诞老公公  真的012---Santa, really?
是啊   可以吗012---Yeah, is that okay?
你爸爸有扮过圣诞老公公吗012---Did your dad ever dress up like Santa?
没有   那就可以012---No. Then it's okay!
班  圣诞老公公要走了012---Okay, Ben. Santa has to go.
说再见012---Say goodbye.
不要   他为什么要走012---No, why does he have to go?
因为圣诞老公公和节日012---Because if Santa and the Holiday...
犰狳（哺乳动物）012---...Armadillo...
如果在同一个房子里待太久的话012---...are ever in the same room for too long...
宇宙就会爆炸012---...the universe will implode!
圣诞快乐012---Merry Christmas!
不要  为什么不是犰狳走呢  我要圣诞老公公012---No, why can't the armadillo leave? I want Santa.
好  我放弃  圣诞老公公012---Fine, I give up. Santa--
圣诞老公公可以留下来012---Santa can stay!
我留下来012---Well, I'll stay...
因为我想听光明节的故事012---...but only because I want to hear about Hanukkah.
班   你要不要和圣诞老公公012---Ben, will you sit here with Santa...
一起坐下来听光明节的故事012---...and learn about Hanukkah?
好的  圣诞老人012---Okay, Santa.
谢谢  不客气012---Thank you. You're welcome.
好  来听012---All right, it's time...
光明节的故事了012---...for the story of Hanukkah.
很多年以前012---Years and years ago...
有一群人叫玛加伯人012---...there were these people called the Maccabees!
圣诞快乐012---Merry Christmas!
喔  看看这地方012---Oh, wow, look at this place!
真糟糕012---Oh, this is terrible.
他们改了很多地方012---They've made so many changes...
我感受不到我祖母的存在了012---...I can't even feel my grandmother's presence anymore.
喔   新的烛台012---Oh, new sconces!
我的天啊  怎么了012---Oh, my God! What?
记得你告诉我   你祖母要做一道墙012---Okay, remember uh, remember how you told me your grandmother put up that wall...
来隔成两间房   对啊012---...to make that into two bedrooms? Yeah.
你说怕房东可能会发现012---And remember how you always said you were afraid the landlord might find out...
把它拆了  对啊012---...and then tear it down? Yeah?
你真的不知道我说这些的原因012---Do you really not know where I'm going with this?
墙没有了  是一间大房间012---It left. It's one huge room.
哦  不012---Oh, no!
哇012---Wow!
看吧012---See?
我们必须要把墙弄回来012---Well, I guess we'll have to put the wall back up.
不行  因为新的天窗   有天窗012---You can't because of the new skylight. There's a skylight?
哇012---Wow!
我们该怎么办   要开始找新地方吗012---Oh. So what should we do? Should we start looking for a new place?
知道吗   我感受到了012---You know, I'm sensing...
我祖母可能不喜欢那样012---...that, urn, my grandmother would not be comfortable with that.
是吗012---Oh, yeah?
又能感觉到她了  是吗012---Starting to feel her again there, are we?
有点  对  是啊012---A little bit. Yeah. Yeah.
菲比  你祖母是不是说  你应该一个人住这里012---Pheebs is your grandmother maybe saying that you should live here alone?
你也听见了   你真有天分012---You heard it too? You have the gift.
菲比  没关系012---Phoebe, it's okay.
我喜欢和乔伊住012---I like living with Joey.
你确定吗   拜托   我讨厌打包012---Are you sure? Please. I hate packing...
那里离公司比较近012---...it's closer to work.
我们在一起很开心012---And we do have fun.
虽然我真的会想念和你住在一起的日子012---Although, I'm really gonna miss living with you.
我也是  我知道012---Oh, me too. I know.
等一下   你有没有听到012---Oh. wait did you hear that-hear that?
听  我听到你祖母在说话012---Listen, I'm getting something from your grandmother.
她说既然你要一个人住这里012---She said since you get to keep the one-bedroom apartment...
你该把那把紫色椅子给瑞秋012---...you should give Rachel the purple chair.
没有  我没有听到012---No, I do not hear that.
奇迹在于那一点点的油012---And the miracle was that that little bit of oil...
应该只够烧一天的  却烧了012---...that should have lasted just one day, burned for...
整整8天  对啊012---Eight whole days. That's right.
这就是为什么我们  今天庆祝光明节   故事完结012---And that's why we celebrate Hanukkah today. The end.
好棒  是啊012---Awesome. Yeah.
我最喜欢的部分012---My favorite part...
是超人救出全埃及的犹太人012---...was when Superman flew all the Jews out of Egypt.
犰狳（哺乳动物）不是那么喜欢那部分012---The armadillo was actually not so thrilled about that part.
好   班   该来点012---Okay, Ben, it's time to light...
光明节蜡烛了012---...the Hanukkah candles!
嘿012---Hey.
哇012---Oh. Wow.
好像是复活节兔子的葬礼012---Looks like the Easter Bunny's funeral in here.
来  来  我们要点蜡烛012---Come on, come on. We're lighting the candles.
哇  啊哦012---Oh, oh.
我了解为什么超人在这里012---I understand why Superman is here...
但为什么有豪猪参加复活节兔子的葬礼012---...but why is there a porcupine at the Easter Bunny's funeral?
你弄好了吗   弄好了012---You get it? I got it.
他进笼子了没012---Back in the cage?
他在笼子里了012---It's back in the cage.
笼子关好了吗012---ls the cage closed?
乔伊  出来好吗  别像个小孩一样012---Joey, will you just come out here and stop being such a baby?
哦  嗯012---Oh. Mm.
嗨  嗨012---Hi. Hey.
你应该尝尝这块起司蛋糕012---You have got to try this cheesecake.
你知道   我的牙不能吃太甜的东西012---Oh, you know, I'm not that much of a sweet tooth--
我的天啊  好香浓012---Oh, my God, it's so creamy. Oh.
那是我吃过的最棒的起司蛋糕012---Oh, my God. That's the best cheesecake I've ever had.
你在哪里买到它012---Where did you get this?
我到家时它就已经放在门口了  应该是有人寄给我们的012---It was at the front door when I got home. Somebody sent it to us.
钱德   收件人可不是你012---Chandler, this isn't addressed to you.
收件人是楼下的布雷曼太太012---This is addressed to Mrs. Braverman downstairs.
小偷012---Thief.
我没看名子就打开盒子了012---I didn't read the box before I opened it...
盒子已经打开   就无法退还了012---...and you can't return a box after you opened it.
为什么  因为它太好吃了012---Why not? Because it's too delicious.
钱德  你偷了这个起司蛋糕   是犯错的012---Chandler, you stole this cheesecake. That is wrong.
不  不  没关系的012---No, no, no, it is going to be okay...
因为布雷曼太太会免费再收到一个012---...because Mrs. Braverman is gonna send away for a free one.
那可是   双赢啊012---And that way, we all win.
唯一的输家是大型起司蛋糕店012---The only losers are the big cheesecake conglomerate:
"妈妈的小面包店"012---"Mama's Little Bakery."
我觉得好难过012---I feel terrible.
我是个大坏蛋  大坏蛋  大坏人012---I'm a horrible, horrible, horrible person.
对不起  你说什么012---Well, I'm sorry, what?
老友记  第七季  第11集  起司蛋糕012---Friends  S07E11 The One With All The Cheesecakes
行了  我得走了  我今天工作很忙012---All right, I should get going. Big day a work.
你们知道我怎么会昏迷不醒吗012---You know how I'm in a coma?
今天他们要帮我做检查   结果发现我没有脑死亡012---Today they do a test on me and it turns out I'm not brain-dead.
所以012---So--
聪明先生012---Ah-ah, Mr. Smarty-Pants.
没有脑死亡的是我演的角色012---It's just my character that's not brain-dead.
菲比  今晚的事没取消吧012---Hey, so Pheebs, still on for tonight?
当然  八点见  好的012---Absolutely. Okay. All right, I'll see you at 8. Okay.
什么东西八点见012---Oh, what's at 8?
我们约好吃晚餐012---Oh, I have dinner plans with Joey.
我们大约一个月会约一次去讨论你们的事012---We get together about once a month to discuss the rest of you guys.
哇  我真的不知道012---Wow. Did not know that.
我能说  你今天看起来很漂亮吗012---May I say how lovely you look today?
那当然012---Duly noted.
那么  明天012---Oh, so for tomorrow...
你要租辆车一起开过去吗012---...do you want to rent a car and drive down together or what?
你在说什么012---What are you talking about?
芬妮表妹的婚礼  明晚啊012---Cousin Frannie's wedding. It's tomorrow night.
你被邀请了012---You were invited?
不012---No.
我的天啊  我不敢相信012---Oh, my God, I can't believe this.
我以为他们只邀请了爸跟妈012---I mean I knew Mom and Dad were invited. I thought that was it.
七岁到九岁  芬妮跟我形影不离012---I mean, from the ages of 7 to 9, Frannie and I were inseparable.
或许九岁后  芬妮交了新朋友012---Well, maybe since the age of 9, Frannie's made some new friends.
或许这只是个误会  我打电话去问雪若阿姨012---Well l-look okay, it's probably just a mistake. Let me call Aunt Cheryl, okay?
或许他们邀请你了  只是请帖寄丢了012---Maybe you are invited and the invitation just got lost in the mail.
你可以打电话告诉她  我们小时候012---Yeah, well, you call her and tell her that, you know, when we were kids...
她的宝贝芬妮好几次想脱光我的衣服012---...her precious little Frannie tried to undress me several times, okay?
要不是我阻止了她  她也结不了婚012---If I hadn't stopped her, there probably wouldn't be a wedding to go to.
她也想脱我的衣服012---She tried to undress me too.
我以前会帮葛兰表弟脱衣服012---I used to undress my cousin Glenn.
乔瑟夫法兰西斯崔比亚尼   你回家了吗012---Joseph Francis Tribbiani, are you home yet?
我想他还没有回家  怎么了012---Um, I think he's still out. What's wrong?
我得告诉你   瑞秋凯伦葛林012---Well, I'll tell you, Rachel Karen Green.
我跟乔伊今晚有约  他留了这张字条给我012---I had plans with Joey tonight, and he left me this note.
"菲比  我没办法赴约  我有约会  待会再谈012---"Pheebs, can't make it. Got a date. Talk to you later.
大爹地"012---Big Daddy?
"大爹地"  那是我们之间的昵称012---"Big Daddy"? Oh, that's a nickname we were trying out.
你知道什么样的昵称  不会跟别人重复吗  "罗斯原子超人"012---Hey, you know what nickname never caught on? "The Ross-a-tron."
乔瑟夫法兰西斯回来了012---Hey. Oh, here's Joseph Francis.
等一下  你干嘛叫我的全名012---Whoa, what are you middle-naming me for'?
我给你留了字条012---I left you a note.
那不是你放我鸽子的好理由012---So what? That doesn't give you the right to ditch me.
如果你有机会上床  当然可以取消跟朋友的约会012---Hey, you can cancel plans with friends if there's a possibility for sex.
菲比  他说的对  这是规则012---Phoebe, he's right. That is the rule.
我无法接受这种事012---I don't accept this rule.
我们约好后  我期待你会出现012---When we make plans, I expect you to show up.
我不是你泡到马子前打发时间的代替品012---Okay, I can't just be a way to kill time till you meet someone better.
男女朋友来来去去   但朋友是一辈子的012---You know, boyfriends and girlfriends are gonna come and go, but this is for life.
我真的很抱歉   我不知道这对你来说那么重要012---Wow. I'm so sorry. I had no idea it would bother you this much.
是啊  它的确很重要012---Well, it does.
我可以弥补你吗012---Okay, can I make it up to you? Huh?
对不起012---I'm sorry.
明天晚上一起吃饭吧   我会自己付钱012---How about dinner tomorrow night? I'll pay for myself.
好吧  你说服了我012---Okay, you wore me down.
乔伊  既然你站在那边  就拿罐啤酒给 "罗斯原子超人"吧012---Hey Joe, while you're over there, how about another beer for "The Ross-a-tron"?
"罗斯" 它又回来了012---"Ross--" Is that back?
又有起司蛋糕012---Hi. The other cheesecake came.
他们又把它送到这里了012---They delivered it to the wrong address again.
把它送到楼下去   能有什么问题012---So just bring it back downstairs. What's the problem?
我不知道该怎么说再见012---I can't seem to say goodbye.
你是认真的吗  钱德  两天前我们才吃掉了一个蛋糕012---Are you serious? Chandler, we ate an entire cheesecake two days ago...
你还想再吃啊012---...and you want more?
喔  我已经忘记它的味道了012---Well, I've forgotten what it tastes like, okay?
它是起司蛋糕   很好吃012---It was cheesecake. It was fine.
它又香又浓   酥酥的饼干012---It had a buttery, crumbly, graham-cracker crust...
还有味道非常浓郁012---...with a very rich...
但不油腻的奶油起司012---...yet light cream-cheese filling.
我的嘴巴全是口水012---Wow, my whole mouth just filled with saliva. Ahem.
你知道吗  忘了它  我们只是饿了012---Y'know what? Forget it. We are just hungry.
我们没吃午饭   所以头昏脑胀的012---We have not had lunch. We are just light-headed.
那我们去吃午饭吧   忘了那个起司蛋糕吧012---So let us go out and have lunch and forget about the cheesecake.
我们得把它还回去  才不会被诱惑012---Yeah and we'll drop it off downstairs so that we're not tempted.
好主意  你要去哪儿吃午饭012---Good idea. Where do you wanna go to lunch?
芝加哥小妈妈面包店012---Mama's Little Bakery, Chicago, Illinois.
梅尔多米死了012---Mel Torme died.
乔伊  那是一年前的报纸了012---Joey, that paper's like a year old.
那就表示山姆古迪商店的大特卖结束了012---Oh, does that mean the Sam Goody's sale is over?
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
我终于收到雪若阿姨的回音012---So I finally heard back from Aunt Cheryl...
很明显地这不是误会012---...and apparently it wasn't a mistake.
婚礼现场座位有限012---Uh, there's limited seating in the hall--
座位有限  我是个瘦皮猴012---Limited seating? I am just one tiny person.
对  但是她不知道012---Well yeah, but she doesn't know that.
我是说上次她看到你012---I mean, the last time she saw you...
你会把婚礼用的小椅子给压垮012---...you would've turned one of those little wedding chairs into kindling.
"座位有限"  真是个烂藉口012---"Limited seating." That's such a lame excuse.
那不是她不邀请我的原因012---That's not the reason why she's not inviting me.
那有什么大不了的呢  我没办法观礼  只能去吃喜酒012---What's the big deal? I wasn't even invited to the ceremony, just the reception.
如果这能让你觉得开心一点012---And you know what? If it makes you feel any better...
琼安跟我只会去亮个相012---...Joan and I will just make an appearance...
我们会提早离开  以示抗议012---...and then we'll leave early as a sign of protest.
琼安  对  她是我的女伴012---Joan? Yeah, Joan Tedeschi, my date.
她是语言学系的助教012---She's an assistant professor in the Linguistics Department.
又高又漂亮012---Tall, very beautiful.
虽然有些人说  别挑太魁梧的女孩012---And despite what some people say, not broad-backed.
等一下  你收到的喜帖是 "请携伴参加"012---Wait a minute. You got "Ross Geller and guest"?
我没有被邀请  你却可以"携伴参加"012---I wasn't invited, and you got "and guest"?
对不起  我真的得解释罗斯的行为012---Uh, excuse me, I do have to interrupt on Ross' behalf.
我想规则也适用在这里012---I think the rule applies here y'know,
因为他有机会跟魁梧女人上床012---Since he has a chance to get on broad-back--
她没有那么魁梧012---Not broad-back!
等一下  你得带我去012---Wait a minute. You're bringing me.
什么  我不能放琼安鸽子012---What? I can't cancel on Joan.
为什么  你没有听到吗012---Why not? Did you not hear me?
她是语言学系的助教012---She's an assistant professor in the Linguistics Department, okay?
她们很辣012---They're wild.
你到底为什么想去   是因为012---Why do you want to come anyway? Because...
她是我表妹012---...she's my cousin.
我是说  我们是一起长大的012---I mean, we grew up together.
我们是家人  你知道吗  对我来说很重要012---Family, you know? And all that's important to me.
好吧  我带你去012---Okay, all right. I'll take you.
我去打电话给琼安012---I'll go call Joan.
那真的是太棒了012---Oh, that's nice.
家人应该要出席的012---Family should be there.
这是她的婚礼  她一生中最快乐的日子012---This is her wedding. Happiest day of her life.
我们等着瞧吧012---We'll see. Ha, ha.
谢谢你请我吃午餐012---Well, thank you for lunch.
什么  等一下  我以为你付了钱012---What? Wait a minute, I didn't pay. I thought you paid.
很明显的  我们不必再掏钱买食物了012---So apparently, we just don't pay for food anymore.
我没有看错吧  它还在那里012---Do you see what I see? Huh! It's still there.
布雷曼太太一定是出去了012---Mrs. Braverman must be out.
她可能出城去了  或许几个月后才会回来012---She could be out of town. Maybe she'll be gone for months.
到时候  蛋糕一定坏了012---By then, the cheesecake may have gone bad.
不能让她回来时看到坏掉的起司蛋糕012---We don't want her to come back to bad cheesecake.
她可能会中毒死掉   我不希望发生那种事012---No that could kill her. Well, we don't want that.
我们是在保护她012---No so we're protecting her.
我们把它拿走  但是要快点012---We should take it. But we should move quick.
为什么  我听到她在里面走动的声音012---Why? Because I think I just heard her moving around in there.
快走  快走012---Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!
天啊  是大卫012---Oh, my God, that's David.
谁  那个科学家大卫012---Who? David, the scientist guy.
我爱上了的那个大卫012---David that I was in love with.
那个去了俄罗斯伤了我的心的大卫012---David who went to Russia and broke my heart, David.
我的天啊012---Oh, my God.
只要一直念某人的名字  那个人就会转过身来012---Oh, you say someone's name enough, they turn around.
菲比  大卫012---Phoebe. David.
你在做什么   你不是在俄罗斯吗012---What are you doing here? Aren't you supposed to be in Russia?
我到城里来开会012---Yeah, I'm just in town for a conference.
天啊  你看起来美得出奇012---Um, God, you look phenomenal.
喔012---Well, ha, ha...
对012---Yeah.
你看起来也很棒  你剪了头发吗012---You look great too. Did you get a haircut?
对  我大概剪了三十次012---Yeah. Well, I got like 3O of them.
是012---Yeah.
听着  我要跟你坦诚一件事012---Um, look, I got a confession to make. Uh-huh.
我希望能在这里遇到你012---Um, I was hoping to run into you here.
我不知道该不该打电话给你  我只会在城里待几天012---I didn't know that I should call or not. You know, I was only in town a few days...
我不想打扰你的生活012---...and, you know, I didn't want to intrude on your life or anything like that,
我真的想见你012---But I really wanted to see you...
但我不知道你要不要见我012---...but I didn't know if you wanted to see me.
我当然想见你  我常常想到你012---Of course I would want to see you. I think about you all the time.
真的吗  因为我也常常想到你012---Really? Because I think about you all the time.
真的吗  明斯克有一座雕像012---Really? There's a statue in Minsk...
让我常常想起你012---...that reminds me of you so much.
实际上  那是列宁的雕像012---I mean, um, it's actually of Lenin...
但有些角度看起来012---...but, you know, at certain angles... Yeah.
总之  今晚你想跟我共进晚餐吗012---Anyway, do you want to have dinner tonight?
好012---Yes.
喔  不012---Oh, no. Oh.
什么  我不能012---Uh, what? I can't.
我不敢相信  我已经有约了  今天不行  明天可以吗012---I can't believe I have plans. I can't. Can you do it tomorrow?
不行  再过几小时我就得离开了  我得赶回去012---Uh, no, I have to go in a few hours. I have to be on the redeye.
听着  下次你到明斯克012---Well, listen, you know, next time you're in Minsk, uh...
菲比  我能跟你谈一谈吗012---Phoebe? Can I talk to you for a second? Uh-huh.
你在做什么012---What are you doing?
我今晚跟乔伊有约  所以呢  他会谅解的012---Well, I have plans with Joey tonight. So? He'll understand.
不  他不会的  那根本不是重点012---No, he won't. And that's not even the point.
摩妮卡  我教训他不该见色忘友012---Monica, I made a whole speech about how you do not cancel plans with friends.
而现在呢   只因为可能是我真爱的人012---And now, you know, what? Just because, potentially, the love of my life...
明天就要回俄罗斯了  我就应该改变我的想法012---...comes back from Russia just for one night, I should change my beliefs?
我应该改变我的想法012---I should change my beliefs.
不  如果失去了原则   我什么都不会有012---No. No, no. If I don't have my principles, I don't have anything.
天啊  你太有说服力了012---God, you are so strong.
或许我可以赶快跟乔伊吃完晚餐  然后九点跟大卫见面012---Or I should rush through dinner with Joey and I could meet David at 9.
我的天啊  真的是太棒了012---Oh, my God, that is so good.
我吃饱了  但我知道  如果我现在停下来012---I'm full. And yet I know if I stop eating this...
我会后悔的012---...I'll regret it.
嘿  你们在吃什么012---Hey, what have you got there?
那是  喔012---Oh, it's, um...
豆腐蛋糕  你要吃一点吗012---it's tofu cake. Do you want some? Aah.
今晚你要做什么012---What are you doing tonight? Huh?
兄弟012---Uh. Dude. Dude.
对不起  我跟菲比有约012---Sorry. Uh, I got those plans with Phoebe.
真的  摩妮卡说她九点有约会012---Oh, really? Uh, Monica said she had a date at 9.
什么  今晚  摩妮卡是那么说的012---What? Tonight? That's what Monica said.
她教训了我一顿012---After she gave me that big speech...
却同时约了我跟她的男伴012---...she goes and makes a date on the same night she has plans with me'?
她想草草解决 "大爹地"012---I think she's trying to pull a fast one on Big Daddy.
好了  我们的位置应该是这一桌012---Oh here, I think this is us. Yeah.
还座位有限  屁话012---Limited seating, my ass.
我们来看看  谁被邀请了012---Let's just see who made the cut.
嗨  我是摩妮卡盖勒012---Hi. Hi. I'm Monica Geller.
你们跟新人是什么关系   我是芬妮以前的同事012---How do you know the bride and groom? I worked with Frannie.
以前的同事  以前012---Used to work with her. Used to.
我是她的亲戚却没有被邀请012---I'm a relative and I didn't get invited, okay?
我是她的血亲  血012---A blood relative. Blood.
别在陌生人面前提到 "血"012---Stop saying "blood" to strangers.
你呢  你跟快乐的新人是什么关系012---So how about you? How do you know the happy couple?
我们是他们的大学同学  现在是他们的邻居012---We went to college with both of them. And now we live next door.
好吧  你还够格012---Okay, you're fine.
你们要点菜了吗  是的012---Hey. Are you guys ready? Hey. Yes.
我要沙拉  特调酱汁  给我水就好了012---I will have a green salad, urn, house dressing and water's fine.
你呢  先生012---Okay. And for you, sir?
对  慢烤鲑鱼012---Yeah. This slow-roasted salmon...
那到底有多慢呢012---...just how slow are we talkin' here?
它已经烤好了012---It's already been roasted.
那我不要了  麻烦你  再告诉我一次今日特餐012---Oh, then no. Maybe I should hear those specials again.
乔伊  我们已经听了三次012---Oh, Joey, we've heard the specials three times, okay?
有烤肋排  鬼头刀鱼  跟特制龙虾饺子012---There's prime rib, mahi-mahi and a very special lobster ravioli.
事实上我们没有饺子了  那我们得重来一次012---Actually, we're out of the lobster ravioli. Oh, well, that changes everything.
你知道吗  菲比012---You know what, Pheebs? Uh-huh.
之前你说的话是对的  朋友太重要了012---You were right before. Friends are so important.
对  我很聪明  我知道012---Yeah, I'm very wise. I know.
你知道我想做什么吗012---You know what I really want?
什么  我想花时间跟你长谈012---What? ls to have a long, long talk.
你知道吗   多告诉我一点人生道理012---You know? Get Joey out on the open road and really open him up.
可以点菜了吗  可以012---Any progress? Yes.
我要点龙虾饺子012---I will have the lobster ravioli.
天啊  乔伊  这得花一辈子的时间012---God, Joey, this is taking forever.
现在干嘛这么急   喔012---What's the rush? Well...
我有个约会012---...I just have, you know, an appointment.
它非常重要012---And it's very important.
怎么说012---What is it?
喔012---Well...
我约了一个男人012---...it's a date.
你约了男人  不  不  菲比  你一定弄错了012---A date? No, no, Pheebs, you must be mistaken...
因为你不能跟男人约会的同时012---...because you wouldn't schedule a date...
又跟朋友约吃饭012---...on the night you have plans with a friend.
别让我觉得内疚012---Come on. Don't make me feel badly about this.
不  我就是要那么做012---No, I'm gonna.
好吧  我跟那个女孩出去012---That's right. Yeah, you made me feel really guilty...
你让我觉得非常内疚012---...about going outwith that girl.
好像我做了什么可怕的事  菲比  现在你也那么做012---Like I did something terrible to you. Now, Pheebs, you're doing the same thing.
我才不呢   这个完全不一样012---That's not the same thing. This is totally different.
我跟大卫有约  你还记得科学家大卫吗012---This is with David. Remember David, the scientist guy?
对我来说他非常特别012---Okay, he's very special to me.
那晚我约的女孩也很特别012---Okay, well, my girl from the other night was special.
她也是个科学家012---She was a scientist too.
是吗  她高中毕业012---She was? Well, she graduated high school.
随便啦  你知道吗012---Okay, whatever. Know what?
我没时间跟你讲道理012---I don't have time to convince you.
他只会在这里待4个小时  我得去见他012---He's only here for four hours and I'm gonna go see him.
好吧  对  对012---Fine. Fine! Yeah. Yeah.
你还在这里做什么  我说过了  龙虾饺子012---What are you still doing here? I told you, lobster ravioli.
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
我正要离开  我以为你不会来了012---Oh, I was just about to leave. I didn't think you were coming.
我绝不会错过这次约会012---Oh, I wouldn't have missed this. Ha, ha.
我很高兴你能来012---Well, I'm very glad you're here.
你是个绅士012---Oh, you're such a gentleman.
来吧  到我家去012---Come on, we're going to my place.
你想一个人独吞起司蛋糕012---Are you eating the cheesecake without me?
只要你现在能吹出口哨  我就给你一百块钱012---I will give you $100 to whistle right now.
你怎么可以不管我  一个人独吞012---How can you eat the cheesecake without me?
你会怎么做呢012---What are you gonna do?
告诉摩妮卡或乔伊  不  你得把一切都告诉他们012---Gonna run and tell Monica or Joey? No, you'd have to tell them what we did.
我们是甜点小偷  我们犯了法012---We are dessert stealers. We are living outside the law.
知道吗  我不能让你跟蛋糕独处012---You know what? I don't trust you with this cake anymore!
我先发现它的  我要把它拿回来  什么012---And I got it first, and I'm taking it back. What?
什么  不  不  对012---What? Oh, no, you don't. Oh, yes.
你以为我就能相信你吗012---You think I trust you with it?
不  我们平分它  你一半  我一半012---We're gonna split it. You take half, I take half.
那不公平   你已经吃掉一点了012---That's not fair. You had some.
我想摩妮卡一定想知道012---Oh, you know what? I think Monica would be very interested to know...
你说她做的起司蛋糕 "又干又粗"012---...that you called her cheesecake dry and mealy.
我们用什么来切蛋糕呢012---What do we use to split it? Okay.
好了  各人拿一块012---All right, pick a half. Okay.
这块比较大012---Well, this side looks bigger. Mm-hm.
但这块饼干比较多012---Uh, but there's more crust on this side.
或许我该量一下012---Yeah. So maybe if I measure it--
拜托  快挑一块012---For God's sake, pick a piece.
好吧  我挑那块  那块比较小012---All right, I pick that one. So the smaller piece.
好了  拿去吧012---Okay. There you go.
好好享受你的蛋糕吧  我的朋友  因为大势已定012---Enjoy your half, my friend. But that is it.
我不会跟你分  或跟你换   别哭着跑来找我012---No sharing, no switching, and don't come crying to me...
如果你一下子就把蛋糕都吃完了012---...if you eat your piece too fast.
好012---Oh!
你要给我点蛋糕吗  不012---You gonna give me some of your piece? Oh, no.
我不会跟你分  或跟你换   别哭着跑来找我012---No switching, no sharing. And don't come crying to me.
我要坐在这里  花一整天好好享用我的蛋糕012---Ha, ha. I may just sit here and have my cake all day.
我要坐在走廊上吃我的012---Just sit here in the hallway and eat my--
罗斯  甜心012---Ross, sweetheart.
嘿  米莉阿姨012---Oh, hey, Aunt Millie.
这个婚礼很温馨吧  对对  没错012---Isn't it a beautiful wedding? Yes. Yes, it is.
她每次都亲嘴巴012---Every time, on the lips.
为什么  为什么要亲嘴巴012---Why? Why on the lips?
芬妮在那边  她看到我一定会很高兴吧012---There's Frannie. Won't she be happy to see me?
等等  你得乖乖的  好吗012---Now, wait a minute. You be nice, all right?
我不是带你来欺负她的012---I didn't bring you here so you could ambush her.
芬妮把你的《花花公子》拿给妈妈看012---Frannie was the one who found your Playboys and showed them to Mom.
那个死小孩012---That bitch.
摩妮卡  什么012---Monica. What--?
我在这里做什么  你看到我很惊讶吗012---Am I doing here? Surprised to see me?
罗斯带我来的  你还喜欢吗012---Ross brought me. How do you like that?
芬妮  恭喜012---Hi, Frannie. Congratulations.
你邀请我的哥哥  我的家人  却不邀请我  为什么012---You invite my brother, you invite my whole family, and not me? Why?
你为什么不希望我来012---Why wouldn't you want me at your wedding?
我做了什么吗012---What could I have possibly done?
史都华012---Stuart.
我相信你认识我丈夫012---I believe you know my husband.
问题应该是   你把上了"谁"012---So it's really a question of "who" could you have possibly done.
我讨厌这样   但我得走了012---I hate this, but I have to go. Mm-hm.
我不能错过飞机012---I can't miss my flight.
我敢说下一班飞往明斯克的飞机是在012---Are you sure? I bet there's another flight to Minsk in--
七月012---July
那真的好窝心  它是什么意思012---That's really beautiful. What does it mean?
"请帮我把杯子洗干净"012---"Please clean my beakers."
我不常离开实验室012---I don't get out of the lab much.
我以为它有别的意思012---I thought it meant something else.
对   事实上  我想说012---Yeah, well, I really actually wanted to say, um...
那个012---...that.
我想或许我不该说  因为012---But, urn, I figured I probably shouldn't because...
我得离开012---...you know, I have to leave.
不  你说的对  别说012---Hmm. No, you're right. Don't say it.
但我真的那么想012---I do, though.
我也是012---I do too.
再见  菲比012---Well, bye, Phoebe.

泰格  我很认真  这不好笑012---Tag, I'm serious. This isn't funny.
那些合约今天一定要寄出去012---Those contracts absolutely had to go out today.
瑞秋  对不起  你没给我什么合约啊012---Rach, I'm sorry, You didn't give me any contracts.

然后我还在角落画了一颗心  因为我不想太像上司012---and then I put a little heart in the corner because I didn't wanna seem to bossy.
告诉你  你没有给我012---I'm telling you, You never gave them to me.
如果我们到办公室去  你会看到它在你的办公桌上012---Y'know what Tag, if we went down to the office, you would see those contracts sitting on your desk.
不  我会看到你很窘  因为它不在我的办公桌上012---No, I'd see you looking embarrassed because they are not on my desk.
也许我很窘  是因为你用裤档接电话012---Or maybe you would see me looking embarrassed because you talk on the phone with your crotch.
你要现在去办公室  不012---You want to go to the office now? No.
算了  太晚了  我们不去办公室了012---Come on, it's late. We're not going down to the office.

不要撞到旁边的垃圾桶012---Not hit the dumpster on the other side.
试着避开中间那棕红色的什么怪东西012---and uh, and try to avoid that weird brownish-red stuff in the middle.
当你跳到下面以后012---So when you get down there...
上到屋顶让我进去012---...you go up to the roof and you let me in.
等下  要我去  你会没事的012---Oh whoa-whoa. Wait a minute. I have to do it? Yeah! Oh yeah, You'll be fine.
就像高空弹跳012---It'll be just like bungee jumping, you know?
但你不会回弹012---But instead of bouncing back up, you won't.
要是我的头撞到水泥地上呢012---Well, what if I smack my head on the concrete?
乔伊  我不想骗你  是有这个可能的012---Well, I'm not gonna lie to you, Joey. It's a possibility.

我不跳  我有一个儿子  要是我死了他就没爸爸了012---Well, I'm not jumping. I have a son. Okay? He won't have a father if I die.
看来我们平手012---Well all right so, it looks like we're even!

真的  牙套好可爱012---Really? Very cute braces.
你知道吗  重点是  泰格  开始找吧012---Anyway, you know what? The point is, Tag, start looking...
你会在你桌上找到那些合约的012---...because you're gonna find those contracts on your desk.
你想像是什么时候给我的  早上还是下午012---So when do you imagine you gave them to me? Morning or afternoon?
下午  塞纳先生午餐后  进来我办公室012---In the afternoon. Mr. Zelner came into my office after lunch...
放在我桌上  我贴了一张随手贴在上面012---...he put them on my desk, and then I put a Post-it on it...

"你要汤还是沙拉"  两样都要  永远都两样都要012---"Do you want soup or salad?" Both, always order both.
我看了半天  我想没人在家012---You know, I'm looking, and I don't think anyone's home here.

也许我该吊着  你爬过我下去012---You know, maybe I should hang, and you should climb down me.
是吗  也许我们应该多讨论一下012---Yeah? Maybe we should talk about that for a little while!
看起来还好远  没有那么远  跳就是了012---It still looks pretty far. It's not that far. Just drop.
不要催我012---Do not rush me!
我的裤子开始下滑  我没穿内裤012---Ross, you should know that my pants are starting to come down, and I'm not wearing any underwear.
哇啊012---Whoa!
我的脚踝  我伤到我的脚踝012---Ow! My ankle! I really hurt my ankle!
我想我扭到了  这里有个硬币012---I think I twisted it when-Ooh, a quarter!
真的是你的最佳表现啊012---That really was some of your best work.
我说了嘛012---I told you.
真不能相信012---I can't believe it.
只剩两小时我就要打电话请假012---I've only got two hours until I call in sick for work.
我7分钟后就要起床012---I have to be up in seven minutes.
你不会相信的  如果你还有7分钟012---Well, you're not gonna believe this, but if you have seven minutes...
真的012---Really?
你想要012---You want to?
你去拿吸尘器  我拿家具打亮剂012---Okay. You get the vacuum cleaner. I'll get the furniture polish.
嘿  你在做什么  嗨012---Hey. What are you doing? Hi.
我想把沙发搬开012---Well, you know, I was thinking of moving the couch over here.
为什么要那样呢012---Why would you want to do that?
那样子我就有好位置可以坐了012---So that there would be a decent place for me to sit?
瑞秋  你本来就有好位置坐了  你的大腿不算012---Rach, there is a decent place to... And your lap does not count.
来吧  帮我把它搬开  不  不  不012---Okay? Come on, help me move this. No, no, no.
你不要  不要012---No? No.
萝希塔不想移开012---Rosita does not move.
对不起  萝希塔  是012---I'm sorry. Rosita? As in--?
就是 "不想动的萝希塔"012---As in "Rosita does not move."
乔伊  只不过是一张椅子  有什么大不了的012---Joey, it's just a chair. What's the big deal?
大不了的是  它到浴室跟到厨房的距离是一样的012---The big deal is that it's the exact equal distance from the bathroom to the kitchen...
而且它的角度让你完全  看不到史提夫的反光012---...and it's at the perfect angle so you don't get any glare coming off of Stevie.
电视机史提夫012---Stevie the TV?
有问题吗  没有012---Is there a problem? No.
他又知道什么012---Oh, what does he know?
来吧  萝希塔  我们这些辣妹得合作才行012---Come on, Rosita. Us chicas gotta stick together.
你这个臭女人012---You bitch.
老友记  第七季  第13集  萝希塔之死012---Friends  S07E13  The One Where Rosita Dies
嘿  罗斯012---Hey, Ross?
我看过房地产广告版012---So I was checking out the real-estate section.
你看这个012---Yeah. Look at this.
看起来好像爸妈的房子012---Oh, it looks like Mom and Dad's house.
院子里的树  正前方也有根断掉的树枝012---Oh, it even has a tree with a broken limb out front.
阁楼的窗户012---And the, uh, window in the attic...
喔  我的天啊012---Oh, my God.
怎么了  阁楼的窗户怎么了012---What? What happened to the window in the attic?
我不敢相信他们要把它卖掉012---I can't believe Mom and Dad are selling the house.
却没有告诉我们012---I can't believe they didn't even tell us.
阁楼的窗户到底是怎么了012---I can't believe I still don't know what happened to the window in the attic.
乔伊  我会买张新椅子赔你  好吗012---Okay, come on. Joey, I'll buy you a new one, all right?
我们马上到店里去  帮你买一张新椅子012---We'll go down to the store right now and we'll get you a new chair.
她还尸骨未寒012---She's not even cold yet.
萝希塔难道不希望  你继续过你的日子吗012---But don't you think Rosita would've wanted you to move on?
我是说她永远  把你的幸福放在第一位012---I mean, you know, she did always put your comfort first.
没错012---That's true.
我不敢相信  我们得跟小时候的家说再见了012---I can't believe we have to say goodbye to the house we grew up in.
天啊  有个陌生人  就要搬进我的房间里012---Man, some stranger's gonna be living in my room.
15年来  他们把你房间  弄得跟神宠差不多012---Well, after 15 years of Morn and Dad keeping it as a shrine to you...
现在一切都该落幕了012---...it's time the velvet ropes came down.
他们也保留你房间有一阵子了012---They kept your room a while.
拜托  我搬出来20分钟后  爸就把我的房间变成健身房了012---Oh, please. Dad turned my room into a gym 20 minutes after I moved out.
我得说  一张日光浴椅  跟一堆维多利亚秘密的目录012---And I gotta say, a tanning bed and a stack of Victoria's Secret catalogs?
那不是健身房012---Not a gym.
别这样  你知道他们爱你  就跟他们爱你一样012---Come on. You know they love you. As much as they love you?
我没出生前  他们以为她不会生  那不是我的错012---I was their first born. They thought she was barren. It's not my fault.
我讨厌今年012---Ugh. I hate this year.
今年有什么不对的了012---What's wrong with this year?
现在已经是二月  我只接到两个按摩客人012---It's already February and I've only given two massages...
而且他们给小费都给得很吝啬012---...and they were both the worst tippers in the world.
你是指我跟罗斯012---That was me and Ross.
喔  没错012---Oh, that's right.
如果你需要钱012---Hey, y'know if you want to pick up some extra cash...
我大学的朋友  做电话行销赚了不少钱012---...some friends of mine made good money in college doing telemarketing.
它一定比上次  我做的电话行销工作还棒012---Yeah, it'd probably be better than the last telephone job I had.
或许我不必常常说 "打我屁股吧"012---You know, I probably won't have to say "spank" as much.
什么012---What?
对  你从来没打过那种电话012---Oh, yeah, like you never called.
真的很简单啊   你只要照着稿子念012---So, basically, this is very easy. You read from the script...
试着多卖一点碳粉就行012---...and try to sell as much toner as you possibly can.
好吧  我办得到012---Okay, I can do that.
对了  我喜欢我的办公室012---Oh, by the way, I love my office. Ha, ha.
我们为什么不来练习一下   好吧012---Why don't we do a trial run? Oh, okay.
好吧012---Um, all right.
嗨  我是帝国办公室文具公司的菲比012---Hi, this is Phoebe from Empire Office Supplies.
请问总务部经理在吗012---Can I speak to your supply manager, please?
我就是总务部经理012---I'm the supply manager.
好  我想跟你谈谈买碳粉的事012---Um, okay. I'd like to talk to you about your toner needs.
我们不需要碳粉  好吧  抱歉打扰你了  再见012---We don't need any toner. Well, I'm sorry to bother you. Bye-bye.
你说的对  这工作真的很容易012---Yeah, you're right. This is easy.
好吧  感觉那通电话哪里不对劲呢012---Okay. What was wrong with that call?
好吧012---Oh, well, all right.
我没有恶意  但你的态度真的很不好012---Um, no offense, but you were kind of rude.
他们永远都会说  他们不需要碳粉  没关系012---They're always gonna tell you they don't need toner, but that's okay.
不管他们说什么012---Because whatever they say...
你都会在稿子里找到标准答案012---...you can find the answer to it, here in the script.
我想  你准备好要卖碳粉了012---Oh. So I think you're ready to sell toner.
还有问题吗  没有了012---Do you have any last questions? No.
等一下  对了  我的确有一个问题012---Oh, wait, yes, I do. I do have one question:
什么是碳粉012---What is toner?
乔伊012---Joey?
乔伊012---JOe?
原封未动012---Full bag?
啤酒还是冰的012---Beer's still cold.
这里一定发生了很可怕的事012---Something terrible must have happened here.
喔  不  不012---Oh, no, no, no.
史提夫  我没来过这里012---Stevie, I was never here.
爸  我在这里012---Dad? I'm here.
嘿  嗨012---Hey. Hi.
感觉上好像昨天  你们跑来看我工作的时候012---God, it seems like just yesterday you guys used to come out to watch me work.
我们不敢相信你们要卖掉房子012---Dad, we can't believe you're selling the house.
也该让新的家庭  在这里开始他们的新生活了012---Well, It's time for a new family to start their memories here.
我希望在支票兑现前  他们不会发现012---And hopefully their check will clear before they find the crack...
地基有裂痕  天花板的石棉瓦破了012---...in the foundation and the asbestos in the ceiling.
我们快把东西拿一拿  离开这里吧012---Let's just grab our stuff and get the hell out of here.
抱歉我们不能收藏你们过时的东西012---I'm sorry we can't store your childhood things anymore.
没关系  我都等不及想要再看那些东西了  所有的回忆012---Oh, it's okay. I can't wait to see everything again. All the memories.
我不知道这里放了什么012---I don't know what's in the boxes down here.
但我知道  阁楼上有六 七箱简易烘焙烤箱012---But I do know that there are six or seven Easy-Bake Ovens in the attic.
我以前最喜欢玩开餐厅的游戏了012---I used to love to play restaurant.
但你最爱的还是 "吃面粉糊"012---Yeah, not as much as you loved to play "uncooked batter eater."
你不能要求小孩子  等着要电灯泡把蛋糕烤好吧012---Hey. It is unreasonable to expect a child to wait for a light bulb to cook brownies.
我想你的箱子应该都在这里012---So I think your boxes are over here.
太棒了012---Oh, great.
嘿012---Hey...
这是谁的烟012---...Dad, whose cigarettes are these?
我不知道012---I don't know.
一定是你妈的012---They must be your mother's.
但求求你别去质问她  我来扔掉吧012---But please, please don't ask her. I'll throw these away.
酷啊  爸  我的成绩单012---Cool. Dad, my report cards.
嘿  快来看看012---Hey, check this out. Dad.
数学 "优等"  自然"优等"  历史"优等"  体育012---Math, A. Science, A. History, A. Gym...
我的磨石机012---Ooh, my rock polisher.
惨了  怎么了012---Uh-oh. What?
你知道每年春天车库都会淹水吗012---You know how the garage floods every spring?
你要怎么把房子卖掉呢012---How are you ever gonna sell this place?
我想我不小心拿摩妮卡的箱子012---I think I accidentally used Monica's boxes...
来挡水  免得保时捷进了水012---...to keep the water away from the Porsche.
喔  不  爸  爸012---Oh, no, Dad. Dad?
搞什么啊012---What the--?
喔  天啊012---Oh, God.
一切都毁了012---Everything's ruined.
爸  她一定会崩溃的012---Dad, she's gonna be crushed.
你该不会是偷偷在抽烟吧012---You don't secretly smoke, do you?
没有012---No.
所以是你妈在抽烟012---So it's just your mother, then.
嗨  我是帝国办公室文具公司的菲比012---Hi. This is Phoebe from Empire Office Supplies.
请问总务部经理在吗012---Can I speak to your supply manager, please?
厄尔  谢谢012---Earl. Thanks.
嗨  厄尔  我是帝国办公室  文具公司的菲比012---Hi, Earl. This is Phoebe from Empire Office Supplies.
我想跟你谈谈买碳粉的事012---I'd like to talk to you about your toner needs.
我不需要碳粉012---I don't need any toner.
我知道了  但是听了我们的价格  大家都会想买碳粉012---I'm hearing what you're saying, but at our prices, everyone needs toner.
我不要012---Not me.
能问你为什么吗012---May I ask why?
你想知道为什么012---You want to know why?
你想知道为什么012---You want to know why?
我真的很想012---I surely do.
好吧012---Okay-
我不需要碳粉012---I don't need any toner...
因为我就要自杀了012---...because I'm gonna kill myself.
嗯012---Um...
那是因为你的碳粉用完了吗012---Is that because you're out of toner?
好吧  今天我不需要碳粉  谢谢你  再见012---Okay, so no toner today. Thanks anyway. Bye-bye.
不  等一下  我不能让你挂电话012---No, no, wait, wait. I can't just let you hang up.
请你跟我说话012---Just please talk to me.
喔012---Well...
今天我只需要做一件事012---I only had one thing to do today.
我想我能把它延期一下吧012---I guess I could push it back.
好吧  你为什么要自杀012---Yeah. Now, why do you want to kill yourself?
十年来  我一直在做012---I've been working for 10 years now at this...
这份没有意义又没有前途的工作012---...meaningless, dead-end job...
办公室里的人根本不知道我的存在012---...and nobody here even knows that I exist.
钱德012---Chandler?
你说什么012---I'm sorry?
听着012---Oh. Look...
我相信他们都知道你的存在012---...I'm sure that people know you exist.
是吗  我在一个小房间里工作  四周都是人012---Oh, yeah? I work in a cubicle surrounded by people.
我已经跟你谈了五分钟  我要自杀的问题012---I've been talking to you for five minutes now about killing myself...
没有人抬头起来看我一眼   等一下012---...and no one's even looked up from their desk. Hang on.
嘿  大伙们012---Hey, everybody, uh...
我要自杀了012---...I'm gonna kill myself.
他们不理我012---I got nothing.
好漂亮的椅子012---Good chair.
好了  如果有人问起012---Now, if anybody asks...
你的名字  就叫萝希塔012---...your name is Rosita.
可怜的小东西  她是英年早逝012---Poor thing. Cut down in her prime.
乔伊  新椅子一小时内就会送来012---Joey, the new chair will be here in an hour.
或许我们该把萝希塔搬出去012---Maybe we should actually move Rosita out of here, you know?
开始疗伤止痛012---Start the healing process.
好吧  我想你说的对012---Yeah, I guess you're right. Okay.
她恢复了012---She's healed.
太奇怪了  不  一点都不奇怪012---That's weird. No, it's not weird.
这是奇迹012---It's a miracle.
这不是奇迹  乔伊  我相信这一定有合理的解释012---It's not a miracle, Joey. I'm sure there's an explanation.
没错  只要你的心地纯正012---There is. If you want something enough and your heart is pure...
奇迹一定会发生012---...wondrous things can happen.
她会了解的   我不是故意的012---Well, she'll understand, right? It's not like I did it on purpose.
爸  对她来说那并不重要012---Dad, that won't matter to her.
你看  我的箱子完全没事  她的东西都012---Look, all my stuff is safe and dry. And all her stuff is...
长出新的东西了012---...growing new stuff.
就是这样的事情012---See, this is exactly the kind of thing...
才让她认为你们爱我更胜于爱她012---...that makes her think you guys love me more than you love her.
天啊  她真的那么认为012---Oh, my God. Does she really think that?
你能怪她吗012---Well, can you blame her?
我不知道  或许我们在潜意识里  是偏爱你的012---I don't know. I suppose we may have favored you unconsciously.
你是个奇迹012---You were a medical marvel.
医生说你妈没办法  我不想听了012---The doctors said your mom couldn't-I don't want to hear about it.
真的吗   现在不想012---Really? Well, not right now.
摩妮卡来这里要找寻回忆012---Okay, look. Monica came here for some memories.
该死的   我们得给她一些回忆啊012---Damn it, we're gonna give her some.
好吧  拿012---Okay, grab...
把空箱子拿过来  要把我的东西012---Grab some empty boxes, okay? We'll take stuff from mine...
放在这些箱子里  只要能骗过她的就行012---...and whatever we can pass off as hers, we'll put them in there.
譬如说  这个  这可能是她做的012---Right. Like, this. She could have made this.
这可能是她的  没错012---This could have been hers. Sure.
现在是告诉我那个"医学奇迹" 的012---You know, if you want to tell the medical marvel story while we work...
适当时机了012---...that'd be fine.
我好高兴能把这张椅子  留下来自己用012---I am so psyched I kept this chair for myself.
对  我也是012---Yeah. Me too.
你知道这张椅子的头垫上  还附了喇叭吗012---Wow, you know, that this thing has speakers in the headrest?
不  真的吗  没错012---No, really? Yeah.
你可以把它跟电视机接在一起  还可以听收音机012---You can hook it up to your TV and you get radio.
我的椅子有自疗的功能012---My chair heals itself.
好吧  我们别提办公室的同事了  好吗012---All right. Earl, let's just forget about the people at the office, okay?
一定有人值得你留恋012---There's gotta be someone else in your life that's worth sticking around for.
你的家人跟朋友呢  或许你有女朋友012---What about your family or friends? Or maybe a girlfriend?
是啊012---Heh. Yeah, right.
喔  抱歉  你的男朋友呢012---Oh, sorry. Boyfriend?
好了  我应该012---Okay, I should...
去做我想做的事了012---I should probably be getting back to my thing now.
再见  不012---See you. No.
我还没有说完  你休想挂我电话012---I'm not finished yet. Don't you dare hang up on me!
新来的女同事真的有一套012---The new girl's good.
哪些箱子是我的012---So which boxes are mine?
你的箱子都在这里  好吧012---These are yours right here. Okay.
着色簿  对  是你喜欢的012---Oh, a coloring book. Yeah, yeah. Oh, you loved that thing.
你去哪里都会012---You always had it with you. You never went anywhere without--
都会带着那本着色簿012---Without that coloring book.
真的吗012---Really?
看起来我老是没办法   把颜色涂在线里面012---Wow. Looks like I had some trouble staying inside the lines.
才不呢012---Uh-uh.
哇  你看这个012---Wow, look at this.
我不敢相信以前我穿得下这件了恤012---I can't believe I even fit into this shirt.
喔  这是你的012---Oh, this is yours.
我不知道它怎么会跑到那里去的012---I don't know how that got in there.
嘿  这不是我的东西012---Hey, this isn't my stuff.
罗斯  这些是你的箱子012---Ross, these are your boxes.
我的箱子在哪里012---Where are my boxes?
车库淹水  甜心  你的箱子都进了水012---The garage flooded, sweetie, and it ruined everything in your boxes.
对不起012---I'm sorry.
只有我的箱子进水了  恐怕是那样的012---Just mine? I'm afraid so.
为什么罗斯的东西都没坏012---So why wasn't Ross' stuff ruined?
我用你的箱子挡水  来保护我的保时捷012---I used your boxes to divert water away from the Porsche.
罗斯的东西都没事  但我什么回忆都没有了012---So wait. Ross' stuff is fine, but I have no memories...
只是为了你不希望  你的汽车底盘碰到水012---...because you wanted to keep the bottom two inches of your car from water?
水里有树叶  泥巴跟杂物012---Well, there was also leaves and gook and stuff.
我不敢相信012---I can't believe this.
去他的  我要抽根烟012---Screw it. I'm having one.
嘿  钱德  嘿012---Hey, Chandler. Hey.
你要不要试试看一张可以平躺着012---How would you like to sit in a chair that fully reclines...
有滚轮按摩功能012---...has a rolling massage...
头垫还附了喇叭的椅子012---...and speakers in the headrest?
是啊  我倒是喜欢  但试过很多次了012---Yeah, I'd love to, but I've tried that so many times...
他们已经不让我进他们店里了012---...they won't even let me in the store anymore.
如果我说  你可以到我家试坐一下呢012---Well, what if I told you that you could do it in my apartment?
你是说012---Are you telling me...
你买了那张  让其他椅子都变成废物的椅子012---...that you bought the chair that is making all other lounge systems obsolete?
那张《椅子杂志》封为  "年度最佳椅子"的椅子012---The chair that Sit Magazine called "Chair of the Year"?

喔  真的是太棒了  太帅了  你为什么会买呢012---Well, that's awesome. That's great. What made you do it?
说来话长  是我弄坏了乔伊的椅子012---Well, it's a long story, but I broke Joey's chair--
哇  是你弄坏了乔伊的椅子012---Whoa, whoa, whoa. You broke Joey's chair?
我还以为是我干的012---Yeah. I thought I broke Joey's chair.
所以我用我的椅子跟它调了包012---That's why I replaced it with mine. Oh.
所以它才会恢复了012---That's how it got fixed.
你以为呢  是妖精把它修好的012---Well, what did you think? That elves came in and fixed it?
不012---No.
是天使干的012---Angels.
我要把我的椅子拿回来012---I'm getting my chair back. Hey.
看起来它根本没有自疗功能012---Well, looks like it wasn't healed after all.
我猜这张椅子是我的了012---So I guess this chair's mine now.
乔伊  你弄坏了我的椅子012---Joey, you broke my chair!
你的椅子012---Your chair?
他以为他把它弄坏了  所以他调换了椅子012---Yeah, he thought he broke your chair, so he switched the chairs.
奇迹根本不存在  没错  乔伊  奇迹不存在012---So there was no miracle? No, Joe. No miracle.
喔  不  这真的是太糟糕了012---Oh, no. This is devastating.
我的信念被击垮了012---My faith is shaken.
我很高兴  这张新椅子能陪我走过这一切012---I'm so glad I have the new chair to get me through this difficult time in my life.
请问  厄尔在哪里012---Excuse me, could you tell me where can I find Earl?

听着  你不能自杀012---Um, look, you can't kill yourself.
我很感激你能赶过来012---Look, urn, I really appreciate you coming down--
不  不  我不能让你那么做012---No, no, I can't let you do it.
为什么012---Why?
因为命运让我今天打电话给你012---Because it was fate that made me call you today.
我还以为你打电话来是要卖碳粉012---I thought it was toner.
好好想一想吧  好吗  这根本不是我的正职012---No. Think about it, okay? This isn't even my regular job, okay?
我第一天上班  第一个电话就打给你012---And my first day on the job, you're my first call.
其他人可能会挂掉电话   但我不会那么做012---And somebody else might have hung up on you, but I wouldn't do that...
因为我了解这种事012---...because I know about this stuff.
我妈是自杀的  真的吗012---My morn killed herself. Really?
她怎么自杀的012---Yes. How?
我才不会教你呢012---I'm not gonna give you tips.
你看不出来吗012---Look, don't you see that this--?
这些都是命中注定的  所以才有我来阻止你自杀012---This all came together so that I could stop you from doing this.
难道不是巧合吗  不  这是命中注定012---Couldn't it just be a coincidence? No, it's fate.
看起来不像是命中注定012---It doesn't really seem like enough to be fate.
喔  好吧  好吧  有件事很奇怪012---Oh, well. Um, okay, here's a weird thing.
我妈妈也是总务部经理012---My mother was also a supply manager.
事实上  我是办公室经理012---I'm actually the office manager.
我的天啊  她也是012---Oh, my God. So was she!
还有这个  好吧012---And get this, okay.
你是厄尔  对吧  她叫做普厄儿012---Your name is Earl, right? Her name was Pearl.
普厄尔012---Pearl?
还有别的证据吗012---Was there anything else?
当然有012---Sure.
你是哪里人012---Um, where are you from?
费城  喔  我的天啊  她也是012---Philadelphia. Oh, my God, so was she!
我都起鸡皮疙瘩了012---Oh, I've got goose bumps.
真的吗012---Really?
我穿的太多了  这里又很热012---Well, I'm wearing layers, and it's warm. Yeah.
或许这些混蛋根本不在乎你012---But-Look. Okay. These jerks might not care about you...
但宇宙在乎你  那才是最重要的012---...but the universe does, and that says a lot.
你们听到了吗012---Did you hear that?
我不需要你们在乎我012---I don't need you guys to care about me...
因为宇宙在乎我012---...because the universe cares.
整个宇宙在乎我012---The whole universe!
我真的希望他们也能在乎我一下012---I really wish they'd care just a little bit.
喔  这真的是太可怕了012---Oh, this is terrible.
所有的东西都毁了012---Everything is destroyed.
你看这个012---Look at this.
它一定很重要我才会保存它  现在我看不出来它是什么东西了012---It obviously meant enough for me to save it, and now I can't tell what it is.
它还软软的012---It's still soft.
你觉得它是什么呢012---What do you think this is?
我想它是老鼠012---Mon, I think it was a mouse.
你还好吗  甜心  你觉得呢012---How are you, honey? How do you think I am?
你毁了我的童年回忆012---You've wrecked all my childhood memories...
你们爱罗斯比爱我多012---...you love Ross more than me.
我刚刚还拿了死老鼠贴着我的脸012---And I just rubbed a dead mouse on my face.
甜心  我们爱你就像我们爱罗斯一样012---Sweetheart, we love you just as much as Ross.
箱子的事我很抱歉012---Now, I'm sorry about everything that happened...
也许我永远没办法补偿你012---...and I'll probably never be able to make it up to you...
但这是个开始012---...but here's a start.
这是什么  我的保时捷的钥匙012---What's this? It's the key to my Porsche.
你的保时捷的钥匙012---Well, the key to your Porsche.
什么  什么012---What? What?
我一直想把它卖掉012---I've been thinking of getting rid of it...
有一天我在车子里看到了自己的倒影012---...and I was driving it the other day and I saw my reflection in a window.
你妈说的对  我看起来像个瘪三012---Your mother's right, I do look like an ass.
你要把它送给我  你一定是在开玩笑  对吗012---You're giving it to me? You're kidding me, right?
等一下012---Well, wait a minute.
几箱蠢东西湿掉了  她就可以拿到保时捷012---I mean, a couple of stupid boxes get wet, and she gets a Porsche?
我们去兜个风吧  太帅了012---Why don't we take it for a spin? All right.
我呢  我是医学奇迹012---What about me? I'm a medical marvel!
喔  好012---Oh, yeah. Oh.
嘿  你们都在012---Hey, guys. Hey.
你们看到钱德的椅子  巴卡兰格了吗012---Know what happened to Chandler's Barcalounger?
乔伊把它弄坏了  后来他把它丢了012---Oh, yeah. Joey broke it. Had to get rid of it.
你在开玩笑吗  我得到了保时捷  而且巴卡兰格被丢掉了012---Are you kidding? I get a Porsche and the Barcaloungers gone?
这是有史以来最棒的一天012---Heh. This is the best day ever!
生日快乐012---Happy birthday!
生日快乐012---Happy birthday!
瑞秋  别这样012---Rach, come on. Rach!
是你的生日啊012---It's your birthday.
嘿012---Hey.
她不像她29岁时那么漂亮了012---She's not as pretty as she was when she was 29.
在葛林小姐出来之前  要先把几件事说清楚012---Ms. Green would like to establish some ground rules before she comes out.
她希望你们不要用到如"或者" "走下坡"等字眼012---She would appreciate it if you didn't use the words "old" or "downhill"...
或是 "它们看来还是很棒"012---...or "They still look pretty damn good."
它们还是012---They do.
瑞秋  出来012---Rachel, come on out.
摩妮卡做了早餐012---Monica made breakfast.
巧克力碎片松饼012---Chocolate chip pancakes.
我们有礼物给你012---We've got presents.
好礼物012---Good ones?
都是两星期前你给的单子上的012---They all came from the list you handed out to us two weeks ago.
我可以只收礼物  而仍然是29岁吗012---Well, can I keep the presents and still be 29?
瑞秋  30岁也没什么大不了的012---Come on, Rach, look, turning 3O is not that big a deal.
真的嘛  你满30岁时也是这么觉得吗012---Oh, really? Is that how you felt when you turned 30?
为什么  上帝  为什么啊012---Why, God, why?
我们讲好的了  让其他人变老  我不要012---We had a deal. Let the others grow old, not me.
只有我这样吗  是我反应过度吗012---Oh, come on, you guys, is it just me? Am I overreacting to this?
不  不是只有你  我的30岁生日也不好过012---No, Rach, it is not just you. My 30th birthday certainly wasn't that much fun.
现在该钱德了012---And now Chandler.
我们都变得这么老了012---We're all getting so old.
为什么这样对我们012---Why are you doing this to us'?

你的生活过得很好  有很棒的工作  很好的朋友012---Rach, you're in a great place in your life. You have an amazing job, good friends.
你的室友是连续剧明星012---Yeah, your roommate's a soap opera star.
你的角色在昏迷中012---Your character is in a coma.
我答应自己这个生日一定不哭012---I promised myself I wasn't gonna cry at this one.
我知道我目前过得很好  但我看到一些人012---I know my life's going pretty well, but I see so many people...
在30岁以前  就完成了他们的目标012---...who've accomplished so many of their goals by the time they're 30.
是啊  你不应该和我比012---Yeah, but you shouldn't compare yourself to me.
来  菲比  你做得到的012---Come on, Phoebe. You can do it Phoebe! Come on!
来了  好了012---Come on. There you go.
我成功了  在跳跳球上走了一哩012---I did it. One mile on a Hippity Hop.
30岁前我想完成的事012---That's it. That's everything I wanted to do before I was 30.
除了我想和我妹修好关系外012---Oh, except I wanted to patch things up with my sister.
嗯  可是012---Oh, well. But, yaw.!
女人  这东西是上帝给的礼物  如果你懂我的意思012---And, girls, this thing is a godsend, if you know what I mean. Heh.
来做点有趣的事吧  今天你想做什么012---Come on, let's have some fun, huh? What do you want to do today?
什么也不做   我什么也不想做012---Nothing. I don't want to do anything.
在30岁生日时什么都不做  总比像罗斯一样做傻事好012---Well, doing nothing on your 30th is better than doing something stupid, like Ross.
那是很实际的一次购买012---Hey, that was a practical purchase.
我需要那个车子做交通工具012---I needed that car for transportation.
好吗  我有小孩012---Okay? I have a child.
我在这车里看来很拉风吧012---How hot do I look in this, huh?
罗斯  一台跑车012---Ross, a sports car?
在裤子里塞袜子不是比较便宜012---Wouldn't it be cheaper to just stuff a sock down there?
这不是为了那个012---That's not what this is about, okay?
我是跑车爱好者012---I am a sports car enthusiast.
我一直都很喜欢车  它的马力多少012---I've always been into cars. What's the horsepower on this thing?
不知道  看看它多亮呀012---I don't know, but look how shiny.
你竟然买了这台车  帅哥  那就载我一程吧012---I can't believe you bought this. So can I have a ride, stud?
上车吧012---Hop in.
准备好你这辈子最稳的一程012---Get ready for the smoothest ride of your life.
可恶012---Damn it.
我好了  下一个是谁012---Okay, who's next?
今天我一定要做点什么012---You know what? I am gonna do something today.
我不能像老太太一样闲坐在这儿012---I'm not just gonna sit around like some old lady.
我要在身上打个洞012---I want to get something pierced.
像是鼻子  舌头  或是别的地方012---Like my, uh, nose or my tongue or something.
真的  那样会痛的012---Really? Because, you know, that hurts.
那又怎样   我是这么想的012---So what? You know, the way I see it--
该死的012---Ow! Son of a bitch.
瑞秋  我知道你经历过的012---Look, Rachel, I know what you're going through.
我25岁生日时吓坏了012---I'm totally freaked out about turning 25.
离开我家012---Get out, get out of my apartment.
瑞秋  你做的很好012---Rach, for what it's worth, I think that you're doing great.
正视事实吧  没有人能真的  好好处理这件事012---I mean, y'know let's face it, no one handles this well.
至少你不行012---Heh. Least of all you.
放回去吧   摩妮卡随时会到家的012---Would you put that back on. Monica's gonna be here any minute.
可是我的 "乔伊结"会痛012---But it hurts my Joey's apple.
最后一次告诉你那叫喉结   不是以每一个人的名字命名的012---Okay, for the last time, it's not named after each individual man.
钱德  你宴会办得真好012---You've done a wonderful job with this party, Chandler.
每样东西看起来都很美丽  没有像你这么美丽的012---Everything looks so lovely. Oh, well, not as lovely as you.
不能相信你有位30岁的女儿012---I mean, I can't believe you would have a 30-year-old daughter.
不能相信你有件30岁的燕尾服012---And you, I can't believe you would have a tux that's 30 years old.
还不止30年  怀上罗斯那次  这件燕尼服就有了012---It's older than that. Ross was actually conceived right near this tuxedo.
哦012---Oh.
大家躲起来  我看到她了  她来了012---Okay, everybody hide. I saw her. She's coming.
蹲下  大家蹲下012---Okay, okay. Everybody down. Everybody down.

好012---0Kay.
我对要满30岁012---See I was, I was a little nervous about turning...
还是有点紧张012---...30.
收碗的小弟带我去喝酒012---So the busboys took me out for some drinks.
待会可能会吐在你身上012---Might want to puke on you later.
事情是这样的  我们替你办了一个惊喜宴会012---Okay, here's the thing. We have thrown a very formal surprise party for you in there!
你的朋友和父母都在里面012---All your friends are in there and your parents.
不  是的012---No. Yes.
不  是的012---No. Yes.
哦  不  我父母从没看我醉过012---Oh, no. My parents have never seen me drunk.
就他们所知012---That they know of.
这样  我们替你弄点咖啡喝   他们就不知道你醉了012---Okay, Here's the thing. We'll get you some coffee and they will never know that you're drunk.
真的  你确定  我会处理好的012---Really, you promise? Yeah, I'll take care of it.
我好爱你012---Okay, I love you so much.

好吧  要不我们这么做012---Okay. Okay, here's what we're gonna do.
我打开车门  放在空档012---I'm gonna break into this minivan, put it in neutral.
你们把它向前推  罗斯就能开出来了012---You guys push it forward so Ross can drive out of the spot.
好  来吧012---Okay? All right. Here we go.
快逃啊012---Haul ass!
30岁生日快乐  给你012---Happy 30th birthday. Here.
献给你的童心  还有你的女人心012---It's for the child in you. And the woman.
30岁快乐012---Happy 30th.
你为什么一直这么说012---Right, Why do you keep saying that?
因为这是我们的30岁生日012---Because it's our 30th birthday.
不  我们不是30   我们31岁了012---Yeah, no, we're not 30. We're 31. Okay.
等一下012---Wait.
哦  是你012---Oh, it's you.
是  怎么012---Yeah. What?
对  我们不是30  我们是31012---Yeah, we're not 30. We're 31.
我的出生证明上是这么写的012---Yuh-huh. That's what it says on my birth certificate.
你有出生证明012---You have your birth certificate?
我妈去世时  我拿到了一箱子的家庭文件012---Yeah, I got a big box of family stuff when my mom died.
我们的妈012---Our mom.
好  好012---Right. Okay.
你有我的吗  没有  我卖给了那个瑞典逃犯了012---Do you have my birth certificate? No, I sold it to a Swedish runaway.
我的老天012---Oh, my God.
我的老天  我们31了012---Oh, my God, we are 31.
是啊012---Yeah.
我失去了整整一年的生命012---I just lost a whole year of my life.
对啊012---0Kay.
你的纪念名字是潘蜜拉  对012---Your middle name is Pamela? Yes.
我从不知道我的是什么  你记得是什么吗012---Oh, I never knew mine. Do you remember what it is?
记得  是菲比012---Yes. Phoebe.
那是我的正式名字  对  好吧  那我不知道012---That's my first name. Right. Okay. Then, no.
看着前面  我们成功地穿过了客厅  你做的很好012---Look at that. We made it all the way across the room. You're doing great.
怎么回事  摩妮卡有一点醉了012---What's going on? Monica's a little drunk.
我喜欢酒醉的摩妮卡012---Yay, I love drunk Monica.
她比正常的摩妮卡有趣多了012---Oh, she's so much more fun than regular Monica.
她不想让她的父母知道012---She doesn't want her parents to know she's drunk.
好  好  我们这么做012---Oh, all right, all right. Here's what we'll do.
我来比她醉得厉害两倍  这样就没有人会注意她了012---I'll get twice as drunk as Monica and then no one's even gonna notice her.
怎么了012---What's going on?
摩妮卡醉了012---Monica's wasted.
或许能让这个宴会有点生机012---Maybe that'll liven up this party.
你能不能帮她换衣服012---Okay, will you just go help her get changed, please?
照顾酒醉  裸体的女人  好像是乔伊的工作012---Okay, but taking care of a drunk, naked woman seems like a job for Joey.
对012---Yep.
这是我的礼物012---This one's from me. Ah.
这不在你的礼单上  不过它真的很好玩012---It wasn't on your list, but hopefully you'll think it's really fun.
滑板车012---A scooter.
照着单子买012---Stick to the list.
永远记得照着单子买012---Always stick to the list.
不  不  我很喜欢  谢谢012---No, no, no, I love it. Thank you.
下一个开我们的礼物  下一个开我们的012---Okay, open ours next. Open ours next.
你们现在是一对  我们就没两个礼物了012---Now that you're a couple, we don't get two presents from you guys?
我上一个生日  你送我一个拥抱012---For my last birthday, you gave me a hug.
念卡片  念卡片012---Okay, read the card, read the card. Okay.
"生日快乐  祖母012---"Happy birthday, Grandma.
开始走下坡总比012---It's better to be over the hill...
被埋在坡下要好012---...than buried under it.
我们爱你  摩妮卡和钱德"好好笑012---All our love, Monica and Chandler." That's funny.
不  不  只是一个玩笑012---No, no, no, no. That was a joke.
我知道  我懂了  很好笑012---No, I know, I get it. It's funny.
因为你不是祖母012---No, because you're not a grandmother.
做为一个祖母  必须结了婚有小孩012---No I know, because to be a grandmother, you have to be married and have children.
我全都没有  所以真的很好笑012---and I don't have any of those things. That's why it's so funny.
我要012---I'm just gonna go...
你只需要买张卡片而己012---All you had to do was buy the card.
你知道吗012---Okay, you know what?
为着没有先生孩子就不高兴  是很笨啊012---I realized it was stupid to get upset about not having a husband and kids.
我只需要有一个计划012---All I really needed was a plan.
我想生三个小孩012---See, I wanna have three kids.
你要全部同一个时候生012---Let me guess. And you want to have them all at the same time...
把他们给你弟弟012---...and you want to have them for your brother. Ha, ha.
我正在说012---As I was saying...
我应该在35岁以前生第一个012---I should probably have the first of the three kids by the time I'm 35, right?
这样我还有五年012---Which gives me five years.
如果我35时要生孩子  我34岁时才需要怀孕012---So if I wanna have a kid when I'm 35, I don't have to get pregnant until I'm 34.
普拉达还有四年时间生产孕妇装012---Which gives Prada four years to start making maternity clothes.
我想在怀孕之前至少结婚一年012---Oh, wait, but I do want to be married for a year before I get pregnant.
真的  要那么久012---Really? That long?
你爱怎么看都行  已经在发生了012---Look all you want, it's happening.
我到33岁再结婚就好012---So I don't have to get married until I'm 33.
我还有3年  3整年啊012---That's three years. That's three whole years.
不过  等一下012---Oh, wait a minute though.
我需要一年半来筹备婚礼012---I'll need a year and a half to plan the wedding.
我希望能认识这个人一年至一年半012---And I'd like to know the guy for like a year, year and a half...
再订婚012---...before we get engaged.
这表示我必须在30岁时认识这个人012---Which means I need to meet the guy by the time I'm 30.
没有问题  因为你才刚刚满012---Which is fine, because you just turned...
28岁012---...28.
不  罗斯  不  有问题012---No, Ross. No, it is not fine.
我应该和我要嫁的对象在一起了012---According to my plan, I should already be with the guy that I'm gonna marry.
你可不可以不要跳012---Will you quit hogging it'?
我告诉你  这就好像看着斑比学走路012---Oh, I'm telling you, it's like watching Bambi learn how to walk.
你醉了012---You're drunk.
爸和妈会生气012---Mom and Dad are gonna be mad.
也许我有一点醉了012---Maybe I'm a little drunk.
那是蟹饼吗012---Hey. Are those crab cakes?
我不是告诉你  蟹饼一出来立刻拿来给我012---Did I not tell you to come straight to me when more crab cakes were ready?
觉得怎么样012---How you feeling?
你好帅012---You are so handsome.
我想在此时此地和你上床012---I want to make love to you right here, right now.
我希望你不会012---I really wish that you wouldn't.
再撑一下  好吗012---All you have to do is just get through a little bit more, okay?
我们就可以带你去睡觉  只要微笑  不要说话012---Then we can put you in bed, okay? Just smile and don't talk to anyone.
演讲  演讲  寿星演讲012---Speech, speech. Let's hear from the birthday girl, huh?
菲比012---Pheebs.
看  大家都在看我012---Don't you see, everybody's looking at me.
我的计划很有效012---The plan's working.
我还没脱掉上衣呢012---I didn't even have to take off my top yet.
演讲  来吧  演讲012---Speech. Come on, speech.
来啊  演讲012---Come on. Speech.
钱德  你离开她一秒都不行012---Hey, Chandler, you can't keep your hands off her for one second.
这样好啊012---Oh, I think it's nice.
我必须这样012---I think it's necessary.
我要谢谢大家来到这里012---I wanna thank you all for coming.
我的家人和我的朋友012---My family and my friends.
我很想说我012---I'd really like to say that I'm, um...
知道我真的很想说什么吗012---You know what I'd really like to say?
我醉了012---I'm drunk.
没错  爸  妈012---That's right, Morn and Dad.
你们的小口琴醉了012---Your little "Harmomica" is hammered.
猜猜怎么着  我以前也喝醉过012---And guess what? I've been drunk before.
我抽过烟012---And I've smoked a cigarette.
你们知道吗  知道吗012---But you know what? You know what?
没关系  没关系  因为我今天满30岁了012---It's all okay. It's okay, because I turned 3O today.
我想做什么就做什么012---And I can do anything I want.
因为我是成年人了012---Because I am a grownup.
好  快  替我脱掉012---Okay, quick. Help me get this off. Yeah.
我失去了整整一年012---I lost a whole year.
真不能相信  真不公平012---I can't believe it. This is so unfair.
菲比  没有关系的012---Come on, Pheebs, it'll be okay.
是吗  是吗012---Will it? Will it?
如果你发现你变31岁了  你会怎么感觉012---How would you feel if you found out you were 31?
不会的  因为我们有个新约定012---That's not gonna happen, you know, because we have a new deal.
还有  这毁了我的时间表012---Plus, it totally ruined my schedule.
我还没做那些我31岁前想做的事012---I haven't done any of the things I wanted to do by the time I was 31.
像什么  像是012---Like what? Like, okay...
我还不认识任何葡萄牙人012---...I haven't met any Portuguese people.
我还没有完美地接吻过012---I haven't had the perfect kiss.
我还没去上狙击手学校012---And I haven't been to sniper school.
菲比  我们去吃蛋糕吧012---Phoebe, y'know why don't we go upstairs and have some birthday cake?
我只想一个人静一下  好吗  待会见012---No, I just feel like being by myself for a while, all right? I'll see you guys later.
谢谢012---Thanks.
可怜的菲比012---Oh, poor Pheebs.
嘿  知道吗  我想我应该陪她走回家012---Hey, you know what, you guys? I think I'm gonna go walk her home.
老天  怎么012---Oh, man. What?
他会吃了蛋糕012---He's gonna eat the cake.
菲比  等等012---Pheebs. Wait up.
听着  我012---Listen, I...
闭上眼睛012---Close your eyes.
你可以将这一项从单子上划掉012---Maybe that's one you can cross off your list.
哦  对了012---Oh, yeah. Heh.
还有  我是16分之1的葡萄牙人012---Oh, and plus, I'm one-sixteenth Portuguese.
好  大家都清楚了  我们要将它抬起来012---Okay, is everybody clear? We're gonna pick it up...
然后移动它012---...and move it.
只需要团队合作  懂吧  我们要抬起这台车012---All we need is teamwork, okay? We're gonna lift the car...
把它滑出来012---...and slide it out.
抬起来012---Lift...
滑出来012---...and slide.
罗斯   抬起来  我真的不觉得这  抬起来012---Ross, I really don't think this-Lift...
滑出来012---...and slide.
好  开始吧  大伙儿012---Okay, here we go. All right, everyone.
抬起来012---Lift...
移出来012---...and slide.
嘿  乔伊  别这样  瑞秋  才刚轮到我012---Hey, Joey-Oh, come on, Rach, my turn just started.
其实呢  我是要和泰格说话012---Actually, I just want to talk to Tag.
哦  好的  嘿  我可以到外面溜溜吗012---Oh, okay. Hey, can I ride this outside?
随便  我不是你妈012---Whatever, okay? I'm not your mother. Okay.
不要到街上012---Not in the street! Yeah.
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
有没有觉得好点  有  我很好  我012---How you doing, you feeling any better? Yeah, I'm doing okay. I'm, um...
我们谈谈012---Let's talk. Okay.
什么事012---Um... What's up?
秦格012---Uh, Tag, um...
你真是个好男人  我们在一起也很开心012---You're such a great guy, and we have so much fun together.
可是我  等下012---but I don't-I don't... Wait.
我知道你要做什么012---I think I see where you're going.
在你说任何话之前  我可以先说一件事吗012---But before you say anything else, can I just say one more thing?
说的好012---Well said.
正是我所谓很开心的好例子012---And a, uh, good example of the fun I was referring to.
但我想  我已经过了只要开心就好的时候了012---Uh, but, heh, I just think I'm past the point where I can, you know, just have fun.
瑞秋  不要这样  这只是因为你30岁了012---Rachel, don't do this. This is just because you're turning 30.
是的012---Yeah, it is.
而你还只是个孩子  你才25岁012---But you're just a kid. I mean, you're 25.
其实是24岁  老天012---Twenty-four, actually. Oh, God.
你知道我希望什么  我希望你比现在大6岁012---You know what I wish? I wish you were six years older.
如果真是希望的话  我倒希望自己年轻6岁012---Well, actually, if I'm wishing for stuff, I actually wish I was six years younger.
我也是  是啊  对不起012---Me too. Yeah. I'm sorry.
嘿  谈得怎么样012---Hey, how'd it go?
行012---Oh.
如果我只要生两个孩子  我可以再保留他一年吗012---If I only want two kids, can I keep him for another year?
你做的对012---You did the right thing.
我不喜欢它了012---I don't like this anymore.
我们在这儿的   一群30岁的人012---Well, here we are. Just a bunch of 30-year-olds.
你知道再过10年  我们就40岁了012---Wow, do you realize in 10 years we're gonna be 40?
为什么  上帝  为什么这么对我们012---Why, God? Why are you doing this to us'?
太好了  我的宝贝终于自由了012---Yes. My baby's finally free.
好极了012---All right.
启动   我们走012---Start it up. Let's go.
哇啊哦012---Whoa-how.!
我们拉不拉风012---How hot are we?
你要买车吗012---You wanna buy a car?
谢谢你们能赶过来012---So thanks for coming by, guys.
我们希望你们能帮我们  想一些婚礼上用的点子012---We wanted to bounce some ideas off of you about the wedding ceremony.
好啊012---Oh.
怎么了  你还好吗  好啊  只是因为012---What's the matter? Are you okay? Yeah, it's just...
摩妮卡说了“婚礼”012---Monica said "wedding."
我们希望你们之中  有人能上台念些感性的文章012---Uh, so we wanted to know if one of you would like to read something during the ceremony.
好吧  我想我应该也能胜任012---Okay, yeah, I guess, I guess I can do that too.
也能胜任012---Too?
我自己想了一个点子  来庆祝你们的婚礼012---Yeah, I kind of, ahem, have something else planned for you guys.
你能告诉我们是什么点子吗   抱歉012---Do you mind telling us what it is? Sorry.
我想把它当成最高机密012---I'm kind of keeping this one on the QT.
不管你是指哪个  我希望会有眨眼睛012---Well, whatever it is, I hope it involves winking.
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
我跟《我日》的编剧谈过012---So I just talked to one of the DOOL writers today,
什么是《我日》 《我们的日子》012---What is DOOL? Days Of Our Lives.
你们一定不相信  我演的角色就要醒过来了012---Anyway, you're not gonna believe it. My character is coming out of his coma!
那真的是太棒了  哇  乔伊012---That's wonderful. Wow, Joey.
不只是那个  我会有个新脑子012---And not only that. I'm getting a new brain!
你的工作跟私生活  进步都好大啊012---So great things are happening at work and in your personal life.
你要换个新脑子012---What do you mean you're getting a new brain?
他们要踢走剧中一个角色012---They're killing off one of the characters, and when she dies...
将她的脑子移植到我的身体里012---...and her brain is being transplanted into my body.
什么  脑部移植手术012---Heh, what? A brain transplant?
这太可笑了012---It's ridiculous.
可笑的是你三个半月没有做过爱012---I think it's ridiculous that you haven't had sex in three and a half months.
现在是冬天  街上的人少了很多012---It's winter. There are fewer people on the street.
他们要踢走谁012---Who are they killing off?
西西雅梦露  她饰演洁西卡拉哈特012---Uh, Cecilia Monroe. She plays Jessica Lockhart.
不  不012---No! No!
她最擅长将饮料泼到别人的脸上012---She is so good at throwing drinks in people's faces.
我从来没看过她喝完一杯饮料012---I don't think I've ever seen her finish a beverage.
还有她打人巴掌的样子  你不想那么做吗012---The way she slaps people. Wouldn't you love to do that?
别那么做012---Don't do it.
她参与这出戏的演出很久了012---And she's been on the show forever.
要代替她一定很难  是啊012---It's gonna be really hard to fill her shoes. Yeah.
那你得帮帮我  当你012---Help me out here. When you--
当你做过脑部移植手术后012---When you come out of the "brain transplant"...
你要变成她012---...you are going to be her?
对  她被困在德瑞克的身体里012---Yes, but in Drake Ramoray's body.
你为什么就是搞不懂  我还以为你是科学家012---Why is this so hard for you to get? I thought you were a scientist.
老友记  第七季  第15集  乔伊换脑012---Friends  S07E15  The One With Joey's New Brain
瑞秋  那边那个男的012---Rash, so that guy there:
是异性恋还是同性恋012---Straight or gay?
他太帅了  不可能是异性恋012---Oh, yeah, he's too cute to be straight. Ha, ha.
大波霸小姐会帮我们查个清楚012---Ooh, Knockers will help us figure it out.
好了  他是异性恋012---All right, straight.
而且一眼就看得出来012---And not subtle.
他忘了拿手机012---He left his cell phone. Oh?
我们得把它交给阿甘  放在失物招领处012---Oh, well, We could hand it to Gunther, he'll put it in lost and found.
或是用它打电话到中国  看看那些人在做什么012---Or we could use it to call China, see how those guys are doing.
如果他打电话来找手机  我接了电话012---What if, uh, he calls his own cell phone to find out who found it, and I answer...
我们开始聊天  之后坠入爱河呢012---...and we start talking and we fell in love?
那到是个很棒的故事012---I mean wouldn't that be a great story?
就像是数码时代的童话故事012---Kind of like a fairy tale for the digital age. Yeah.
听起来真棒  我要去拿手机012---That does sound great. I'm gonna get the phone.
什么  等一下  为什么你会成为故事的女主角012---What? Wait. Why do you get the story?
我不知道  我已经很久没有约会了012---I don't know. I haven't been out on a date in so long.
菲比  三天前你才约过会012---Phoebe, you had a date three days ago.
那不是约会  那只是  朋友聚会  然后做爱012---That wasn't a date. That was, That was just friends getting together and having sex.
好吧  这样  我去拿手机012---Okay. Great. See, I get the phone.
不行  不行  一星期前你才跟泰格分手012---No way! No way! You just broke up with Tag a week ago.
对  直到现在  我才明白  我能再爱一次012---Yeah, and until now, I didn't think I would love again.
说的好  等一下012---Nice try. Hey, wait.
我们该怎么公平地决定  谁能拿走手机呢012---How do we fairly decide who gets the phone?
我不知道012---I don't know.
要不012---Well, um...
或许我们可以012---Maybe we could, uh...
你动作太慢了012---Ah-ha! Too slow! Ha-ha-ha.
你太自信了012---Ah-ha! Too cocky.
我在跟他约会  你管不了012---I'm going to keep dating him Mother, and there's nothing you can do about it!
不  我管得了012---Yes, there is.
你打算怎么做  杀了他吗  就像你杀了查尔斯012---What are you going to do? Kill him? Like you did with Charles?!
我的宝贝012---Oh, my baby.
卡012---Cut!
你演得太好了  刚刚那一巴掌  很逼真  你怎么办到的012---That was a great scene. And that slap looked so real. How do you do that?
那只是多年的经验而已  快给我拿些冰块过来012---Oh, just years of experience. Can I get some ice here?
我只想说  我觉得你的演技很棒012---Anyway, I just wanted to say how wonderful I think you are.
你该不会是  那个快死掉的影迷吧012---You're not the fan who's dying, are you?
不  我是乔伊崔比亚尼   昨天我们合拍过一场戏012---No. No, uh, I'm Joey Tribbiani. We did a scene together yesterday.
我就是那个昏迷的人  那是真人012---I'm the guy in the coma. Oh, that was a real person?
因为你离开后我要移植你的脑子012---An-an-anyway I-I just wanted to say, since I'm getting your brain when you leave the show...
我在想如果  我要离开剧组012---...I was wondering if there was any tips you can give me... I'm leaving the show?
不知道  为什么  你听到什么了012---I don't know, why? Did you hear something?
是谁告诉你的012---Who told you that? Oh, uh...
编剧之一  哪个编剧  是秃头佬还是高个子012---Oh uh, One of the writers. Which one? Was it bald or was it tall?
那个不重要   因为那不是真的012---You know, it doesn't matter, because it is not true.
好吧012---Okay. Whoo, eh.
如果那是真的  你竟然敢来叫我教你012---And if it were true, how dare you come to me and ask me for tips...
该如何饰演我演了二十年的角色012---...about a character I've been playing for 20 years! I'll give you a tip!
梦露小姐  好吧  你干的不错012---Miss Monroe-Oh, there you go.
好吧  听着  我有个点子012---Okay, look, I have an idea.
我们为什么不看看  他的快速拨键记录了哪些电话号码呢012---Why don't we, Why don't we see what kind of numbers he has on his speed dial'?
跟他有最多共通点的人012---And then from that, we can tell who has more in common with him...
就可以把手机拿走012---...and whoever does gets the phone.
行  好吧  好吧012---Fine. All right. All right.
速拨键的第一个名字是 "妈妈"012---First name on the speed dial is "Mom." Oh.
喔  我妈妈自杀死了012---I lost my mom to suicide.
不行012---Okay, no way.
你不能利用那一点  抢走帅哥跟最后一块蓝莓松饼012---You can't use that to get the cute guy and the last muffin.
今天我已经用过那个借口了  对不起012---Did I use that already today? I'm sorry.
班  卡洛斯  大卫012---"Ben, Carlos, David--"
我赢了  他在速拨键里记下了巴尼斯012---Oh, I win. He's got Barney's on his speed dial.
你不知道  他指的是不是巴尼斯服饰店012---So? You don't know that it's Barney's the store.
那可能是他朋友家或是酒吧的电话012---That could be y'know his friend's house, or a bar, or--
谁会把巴尼斯服饰店的电话  记录成快速拨键呢012---Who has Barney's the store on their speed dial?
他的新女朋友012---His new girlfriend.
那是什么声音012---What is that?
我想是快死掉的猫在举行游行012---I think it's the Dying Cat Parade.
听起来是从对街传来的012---Sounds like it's coming from across the street.
我的天啊  什么012---Oh, my God. What?
还记得罗斯说过  他要在婚礼上给我们惊喜吗012---Y'know that thing that Ross was gonna do at our wedding?
他跟我出去混时说  "你有苏格兰的血统吧"012---He was hanging out with me yesterday and he turned to me and said, "You're half Scottish, right?"
不  不可能  不可能是罗斯012---No. There is no way. It cannot be Ross.
不可思议  为什么你有苏格兰血统012---Unbelievable. Why is your family Scottish?
为什么罗斯是你哥哥012---Why is your family Ross?
他不能在婚礼上演奏  大家都会跑光的012---He cannot play at our wedding. I mean everyone will leave.
别这样  那只是噪音012---I mean, come on. That is just noise!
那根本不算是歌012---It's not even a song.
等一下  如果你仔细听012---Wait. If you listen very carefully, I think...
我想它是库尔  与伙伴合唱团唱的《庆祝》012---...it's "Celebration" by Kool and the Gang.
你说的对  他们是要将我踢出这出戏012---You're absolutely right. They are writing me out of the show.
他们还没有决定  什么时候  但应该很快012---They don't know exactly when it's going to happen, but apparently it's soon...
就是这样了012---...and then that's it.
我真的很抱歉  如果我可以决定  你永远都不会离开这出戏012---I'm sorry. If it was up to me, you would never leave the show.
谢谢你  我是认真的012---Yeah, thanks. No, I mean it.
我不敢相信他们会对你这么做  还有你的影迷012---I can't believe they'd do this to you. And to your fans.
他们一定会崩溃伤心  他们是那么地爱你012---They're gonna be devastated. Heartbroken. They love you so much.
你说的对012---Oh, you're right.
谢谢012---Thank you.
你说你叫什么名字012---What's your name again? Uh
乔伊  谢谢你012---Joey. Joey. Well, thank you.
你真的太贴心了012---That is so sweet. Oh.
听着  之前我来找你012---The-The only reason that I, that I came up to you before...
是因为012---...was because, well...
因为要饰演你我真的很紧张012---...because I'm really nervous about being you.
请你帮我抓住角色的精髓012---You know, if you could help me capture the essence of the character.
帮助我让洁西卡  继续活下去  可以吗012---Y'know? Help me keep Jessica alive. Please?
好吧  乔伊  我会帮你012---All right, Joey, I will help you.
不是因为我对这出蠢戏有亏欠012---Not because I owe it to this stupid show...
而是因为我亏欠洁西卡012---...but because I owe it to Jessica.
真的是太棒了  谢谢你  别客气012---Oh, that's great. Thank you so much. You're so welcome.
我一直在观摩录影带  你觉得这招如何012---I've been watching some tapes. How's this?
洁西卡拉哈特  永远都不会再踏入这里012---Jessica Lockhart will never step foot in this place again!
永远都不会012---Ever!
但洁西卡没有英国腔012---Oh, but, Jessica doesn't have an English accent.
我有英国腔012---I can do an English accent?
我要把这点写在我的履历表里012---That baby's going on my resume.
嗨  你好吗   我很好012---Hi, Pheebs. How are you? Good.
还记得我们在咖啡厅012---Um, Phoebe, remember when we were in the coffeehouse...
我们决定我可以  拿走那个帅哥的手机吗012---...we decided I was gonna keep the cute guy's phone?
记得啊  我把它放在我的皮包里012---Yeah. And remember how I said I was gonna keep it in my purse...
如果它响了  我就能立刻接听012---...so that if it rang, I could just pick it up? Yeah.
你还记得你从我的皮包  把手机偷走了吗012---And then do you remember going into my purse and stealing the phone?
我听不懂你在说什么012---Ooh, now you lost me.
你偷走了手机  不  我没有012---You stole the phone. No, I didn't.
没有  如果我拨号过去  它会不会响呢012---No? So you're saying that if I called it, it wouldn't ring?
不会  好吧012---No. Hmm. Okay.
既然你要拨号了  我要让你看看  我刚买的响铃皮包012---Umm, okay. But while you dial, let me show you the features of my new ringing handbag.
喔  它真的响了012---Oh, it does work.
菲比  那是另一只手机012---Phoebe. That is a different phone.
是吗  喂  对  你好  瑞秋在吗012---Oh, is it? Hello. Yes, hi. ls Rachel there?
她在  请稍等  是找我的012---Yes, she is. Just one moment, please. It's for me!
那是铁证012---That is damning evidence. Ugh.
我的天啊  我敢说是他打来的012---Oh, my God. I bet that's him.
我的数码童话故事就要开始了012---My digital fairy tale's about to begin.
你真是012---It's ri--
你能不能别再那么做了012---Would you stop doing that?
喂  对  我就是捡到你手机的人012---Hello? Yes, I'm the one who found your phone.
菲比  你不能  我在打电话012---Phoebe, you can't do th-Shh, I'm on a call.
对  今晚你能过来拿  就八点半吧012---Well, yeah, I mean, you could pick it up tonight. Say, 8:30?
到我家来012---At my apartment. It's, um--
摩顿街五号  十四号房012---It's, um, 5 Morton Street, apartment 14.
或许之后我们可以去吃点东西012---And then maybe, you know, after, we could grab a bite to eat or whatever.
好的  到时候见  再见012---Okay. Okay, I'll see you then. Bye.
你知道他来的时候我会在这里012---You do know that I will be here when he comes over.
你怎么知道他什么时候会来012---Oh, and how will you know what time to come over?
你刚刚说出来了012---You just said it.
这个角色的精髓源自于她的自信012---Joey, the essence of the character is rooted in her confidence.
譬如说  当洁西卡走进一个房间时012---So when Jessica enters a room, for instance...
她拥有那个房间里012---...she owns everything...
所有事物跟所有人012---...and every person in that room.
你来试试看  好吧012---You try it. Okay.
他没有对这个房间生气012---Right. Well, he's not mad at the room.
再试一次  他拥有它  他拥有这个房间012---Try it again. He owns it. He owns the room.
这是他的  他拥有  这个房间  他拥有它012---It is his. He owns, owns, owns the room! He owns it!
这看着有点奇怪   但已经好多了012---It's a little weird, but it's getting better.
我一定会很想念这个女人  我不知道我该怎么办012---Oh, I'm gonna miss this woman so much. I don't know what I'm gonna do.
我演这出戏二十年了012---It's been 20 years of my life.
或许这是件好事012---Hey, hey. Maybe-Maybe, uh-Maybe this is a good thing.
它给你机会做改变   扮演不一样的角色012---You know? It'll give you a chance to shake things up. Play different characters.
你才华洋溢012---You're so talented.
或许我该在几年前离开   那时很多人找我接戏012---Probably should've just left years ago when the offers were pouring in...
但我在这里过得太舒服了012---...but, you know, I just got so comfy here and...
我错失了很多大好的机会012---Ugh, I turned down some amazing work.
譬如说呢  喔012---Like what? Well...
就说如果我在十五年前离开012---...let's just say if I'd left 15 years ago...
现在的墨西哥影坛会完全不一样的012---...the landscape of Mexican cinema would be very different today.
哇012---Wow.
但现在现在时机不一样了012---But, well, now... Now's a different time for me.
嘿  别这样  别这样012---Oh, hey, come on. Don't, uh-Don't do this.
听我说句话  好吗012---Let me tell you something, okay?
当我看到你演戏时  我想 "天啊  她是个很棒的演员"012---Now when I watch you do a scene, I'm thinking, "Boy, she is a great actress."
但我也会想 "她好辣"012---But-But I'm also thinking, "She is hot."
你觉得我很辣012---You think I'm hot?
你拥有这个房间012---You own the room.
或许我们应该012---We-We should probably get the...
对  我们应该012---Oh, yeah. Yeah, we should get--
当洁西卡吻男人时012---So when Jessica kisses a man...
她通常会把012---...she usually puts, um...
双手放在那个男人脸上012---...both her hands on the man's face.
我注意到了  那是因为她充满了热情吗012---Yeah, I notice that. Is that because she's so passionate?
不  那是因为  那样子摄影机只能拍到她012---No, it's because that way the camera only sees her.
你想试试看吗012---You want to try it?
好的012---Yeah, okay.
太棒了  真的很不错012---That was good. That was really good.
但我想你手的位置不对012---But I think that maybe your hands are just a little off.
它们应该  像这样012---They should be, maybe-Like, right-Mm.
我想吃一些点心012---Well, I feel like a snack.
你要吃点脆饼吗  它可是你故乡苏格兰的点心012---Do you want some shortbread? It's Scottish, like you are.
不  谢谢  我不喜欢苏格兰的东西012---Oh, no, thanks. I don't like anything from my Scottish heritage.
什么012---What?
因为我的家族被赶出苏格兰012---Well, it's just that my entire family was run out of Scotland by...
是维京人干的012---...Vikings.
听起来你家人  准备要恢复苏格兰传统012---Oh well, it sounds to me like your family's ready to, uh, rediscover its Scottish roots.
你不能在婚礼上吹风笛012---You can't play bagpipes at the wedding!
你们怎么知道012---How did you know about that?
我们听到你在家里吹风笛012---We heard you play all the way from your apartment.
是你们去报警的012---Were you the ones who called the cops?
现在那个真的不重要了012---That's not really important right now. Ahem.
重要的是  我们谢谢你的好意012---What is important is, while we appreciate the gesture...
我们只是觉得  我们的婚礼上不适合吹风笛012---...we just don't feel that bagpipes are appropriate for our wedding.
为什么   因为我们讨厌风笛012---Why not? Because we hate them.
给我机会为你们表演  再做最后的决定012---Just give me a chance to perform for you, and then decide whatever you want.
我也不会告诉你们  我要吹哪首曲子012---I'm not gonna tell you what song I'm gonna play, either. But, uh...
就说当表演结束后012---...let's just say when it's over...
我们一定会庆祝一下012---...I'll bet there'll be a wee bit 0' celebration.
嘿  嘿012---Hey, hey!
是谁012---Who is it?
我是汤姆012---Hi, It's Tom.
我来拿手机的012---I'm hereto pick up the phone. Ah!
为什么要你去开门012---Whoa, why do you get to answer the door?
为什么不行   因为这里是我家012---Why shouldn't I? Because it's my apartment.
那么由我来把手机交给他012---Well, then I get to give him the phone.
好吧  希望你能好好  跟他解释那些打到中国的电话012---Okay. Good luck explaining all the calls to China.
嗨012---Hi.
我们争执了多久012---Wow, how long were we arguing for?
你不是那个忘了拿手机的人012---You're not the man who left the cell phone.
对  他是我的助理  他会来吗012---No, that's my assistant. Is he coming?
不会012---Um, no.
你能让我们谈一下吗012---Could you, uh, give us one second?
没问题  我们马上回来012---Sure. We'll be right back, sir.
我们该怎么办   我不知道012---Well, what do we do? I don't know.
你能相信吗012---Can you believe this?
我们在等一个帅哥  结果来了一个超级大帅哥012---We were waiting for a hot guy and an even hotter one shows up.
我知道012---I know--
什么012---What?
瑞秋  听我说012---Rachel, listen...
如果你能把他让给我  我真的欠你一个大人情012---...if you let me have him, then I will really owe you one.
好吧012---All right.
好吧  菲比  我把他让给你012---All right, All right Phoebe, I will let you have him.
但你欠我一个大人情012---But you owe me. You owe me big.
哪一位漂亮的小姐要陪我去吃晚餐012---So which one of you lovely ladies am I gonna take to dinner, huh?
是我012---Oh, that'd be me, sir.
你先走  谢谢012---After you. Okay, thank you.
太棒了012---Nice.
你的确拥有那个房间012---Well, you certainly own that room.
事实上  我租下了整间公寓012---Actually, I rent the whole place.
我刚了解你的意思了  谢谢夸奖012---And I just got what you meant. Thank you.
嗨  嘿012---Hi. Hey.
我的天啊012---Oh, my God.
我的天啊012---Oh, my God.
洁西卡拉哈特在我家里面012---Aah! Jessica Lockhart! In my apartment!
我是你的头号大影迷   我是你的头号大影迷012---I am such a huge fan. I am such a huge fan.
很高兴能知道012---Well, it's nice to know that--
摩妮卡  摩妮卡012---Monica! Monica!
她是我的室友瑞秋012---That, uh-That's my roommate, Rachel.
难怪你家里会有女人内衣012---Oh, that explains all the women's underwear.
没错012---Sure. Yeah.
我的天啊  是真的012---Oh, my God, it's true!
我的天啊012---Oh, my God.
我能请你帮我一个忙吗012---Can I just ask you to do me-Aw. just one favor?
当然可以012---Certainly.
你能打我一巴掌   朝脸上这里打吗012---Would you slap me? Would you slap me right here in the face?
我很愿意  但我的律师说  我不能再那么做了012---I'd love to, but my lawyer said I can't do that anymore.
好了  我们走吧012---All right, here we go. Okay.
不  等一下012---No, wait. Just one moment. Um--
你个蠢贱人  我真的很抱歉  不012---You're a stupid bitch. I really can't slap you.
我的天啊  你们太棒了  谢谢你们的拜访  再见012---My God, you're great. Thanks for stopping by. See you.
我很抱歉  不  不012---I am so sorry about that. Oh, no, no, no.
我习惯被影迷包围  别担心012---Being adored, I'm used to it. Don't worry about it.
我的天啊  什么012---Oh, my God. What?
他们给我寄了今天的剧本  他们从来没有寄剧本给我过012---They sent me today's script. They never send me the script.
是吗   我一直都昏迷不醒012---They don't? Well, no, I'm just in a coma.
这代表我有台词了012---This must mean I have lines.
我是怎么死的012---How does it happen?
你摔下马   然后撞到电篱笆012---You get thrown from a horse into an electric fence.
什么  洁西卡讨厌马012---A what? Jessica hates horses.
经过这件事  她也不会喜欢电了012---I'm guessing after this she's not gonna be crazy about electricity, either.
在妈妈的马鞍上动手脚  是个超级好点子  佛莱德克012---Loosening the saddle on Mother's horse was brilliant, Fredrick.
电篱笆那个点子太妙了012---And the electric fence, inspired.
谢谢你  亲爱的012---Thank you, sweetheart.
我不敢相信她真的死了012---I can't believe she's really gone.
看看你的四周   一切都是我们的012---Look around you. All of this is ours.
我可不那么认为012---I don't think so.
你是谁012---Who are you?
怎么了  笛娜012---What's the matter, Dina?
你不认得你自己的012---Don't you recognize your own...
妈妈了吗012---...mother?
卡  大家都演得很好  谢谢012---Cut! That was great, everybody. Thank you.
真的是太棒了012---That was so wonderful!
我想你比我更适合演洁西卡012---Oh, I think that you're a better Jessica than I ever was.
喔  不  当然不是  但你真的很棒012---Oh, no. Of course not, but you were very good.
谢谢012---Heh, thanks.
好消息  我找到新工作了012---Guess what? Good news. I got another job.

我敢说你能在那里拥有几个地方012---I bet that you could, uh, own a few places down there.
你知道的  或许我该先在纽约买房子012---Oh, you know, I should probably buy a place in the city first.
我才刚反应过来你的意思  那012---And I just got what you meant again. That is a--
那真的有难度  真的很难012---I'll tell you, that's a tricky one. It's a tricky one.
好吧012---Well...
祝你好运012---Good luck.
你也是012---You too.
请记住  我还在学吹风笛012---Ahem. Okay, now, uh, remember, I'm still learning.

可以帮我一个大忙吗012---Hey listen can you do me a big favor?
院长办公室召开紧急会议012---The, uh, dean's office called and said there was an urgent meeting.
替我照看小班一小时好吗012---Can you watch Ben for an hour?
摩妮卡呢  她不在家012---Well, What-what about Monica? Uh, she isn't home.
只有我一个人012---So it would just be me alone?
小班也会在  不是012---Well, Ben would be there. No.
怎么了  那个  只是012---What's the matter? Well, uh, you know, it's just, uh...
我从没试过呢  和他单独在一起012---I've never done that before. Me and him, alone.
他又没有犯罪前科012---He's not an ex-con.
好  好吧012---Okay, okay, okay. Um...
我和他做什么呢  我不知道  和他说说话012---What do I, What do I do with him? I don't know, Just-just talk to him.
娱乐娱乐  让他活着就行012---Entertain him. Keep him alive.
好  小班  来012---Okay. Okay, Ben, come here.
我要把你留在这儿和瑞秋阿姨一起一小时  好吗012---All right, I'm gonna leave you here with Aunt Rachel for about an hour, okay?
你可以吧012---Are you gonna be okay?
我可以  我不是和你说话012---Yeah I think so. I wasn't talking to you.
老友记  第七季  第16集  伦敦真相012---Friends  S07E16  The One With The Truth About London
第二位牧师如何  我还蛮喜欢他的012---What about the second minister we meet with? I kind of liked him.
你指喷口水那个  别这样  他还没那么糟012---You mean the spitter? Come on. He wasn't that bad.
说的容易  你倒遮着面纱012---Easy for you to say, you'd be wearing a veil.
第三个呢   那个直盯着你的胸部看012---what about the third guy? You mean the guy who kept staring at your chest.
你能怪他吗012---Can you blame him?
我不希望我说  "我愿意"时012---Sorry, I just don't like the idea of me saying, "I do"...
他想着 "我也愿意"012---...he's thinking, "I'd do it too."
那我们还有一个问题  什么012---Well, then we still have a problem. With what?
我们需要证婚人012---Well, we're trying to find someone to perform our wedding...
但他们都相当的无趣  要么就是相当讨厌012---...and they're all either boring or annoying...
要么就是一直盯着女生看012---...or can't stop staring at the ladies.
应该让我们其中一人来证婚012---Ooh, you should have one of us do it.
我们是要 "结婚" 结婚  不是"六年级"的结婚012---Phoebe, We're getting "married" married, not "6th-grade" married.
是真的012---No! No! it's a real thing.
任何人都能在网络上被任命为牧师然后来证婚012---Anyone can get ordained on the Internet and perform weddings and stuff.
我要012---I call it!
什么啊  是我的主意012---What? It was my idea!
非常感谢你们  但你们  谁也不会替我们证婚012---Thank you very much, but neither of you is marrying us.
提出请求不再有任何意义了吗012---Does calling it not mean anything anymore?
我们要一位正式的牧师012---We are going to having a legitimate clergy member.
我说正式   指的是同性恋012---And when I say legitimate, I mean gay...
而且能控制自己口水的012---...and in control of his saliva.
小班  你知道  当你还是个婴儿时012---Ben, you know, when, uh-When you were a baby...
我们就常在一起了012---...you and I used to hang out all the time.
那时候我是你爸的女朋友012---Because I was, I was your daddy's girlfriend.
可是你现在不是了012---But you're not anymore.
不  我不是  因为你们想分开一下012---No, I'm not. Because you guys were on a break--
嘿  我们不是那样012---Hey, we were not on a Okay.
我爸什么时候会回来  52分钟后012---When's my daddy coming back? Fifty-two minutes.
你没有兄弟姊妹  是吧012---So no brothers or sisters, huh?
我有两个姊妹  我们彼此折磨012---But You know what, I had two sisters and we just tortured each other.
真的  像怎样  我们会012---Really? Like how? Well, you know, we would, um...
重覆另一个人说的每一句话012---We'd repeat everything the other said...
或是从衣柜跳出去吓人012---...or, uh, we'd jump out of closets to scare each other...
或是把糖换成盐  让别人把盐倒到早餐麦片里012---...or, ha, switch the sugar for the salt so they put salt on their cereal.
这个不错012---That's a good one.
你喜欢吗  是啊  你真好玩012---Yeah, you like that one? Yeah, you're funny.
我真的好玩吗012---I'm funny?
感谢上帝012---Oh, thank God.
嘿  我有一大堆这种故事012---Well, hey, I got a ton of these.
拿一枚25分硬币012---Um, you, uh-You take a quarter...
你拿一枚25分硬币012---You take a quarter...
把边缘涂黑012---...and you blacken the edge, right?
然后说 "我打赌  你不能让这枚硬币012---And then you say to person, "I bet you can't roll this quarter...
滚过你的下巴而不离开你的脸"012---...from your forehead to your chin without it leaving your face."
等他们这么做了  就会在脸正中央留下一条线012---And when they do it, they're left with a big black pencil line right down the center of their face.
我可以对你这样吗012---Can I do it to you?
小班  我这是幽默  但我不笨012---Yeah, I'm funny, Ben, but I'm not stupid.
好吧012---Heh, okay?
你们找到证婚人了吗012---So did you, uh, find anyone to marry you guys yet?
没有  但"痴迷摩妮卡"的牧师打电话来012---No, but "Horny for Monica" minister called...
想知道我们是否还在一起012---...wanting to know if we're still together.
我们永远不会找到人的   要不让我来012---We'll never find anybody. Then let me do it.
乔伊  不不不  我想过了012---Joe-No-no-no! Look, I've been thinking about it.
我是个演员  我在人前也不会紧张012---I'm an actor right? so I won't get nervous talking in front of people.
我不会喷口水  也不会盯着摩妮卡的胸部看012---I won't spit and I won't stare at Monica's breasts.
大家都知道我喜欢的是臀部012---Y'know? Everyone knows I'm an ass man.
那倒是真的  最重要的是012---That is true. Yeah and the most important thing...
不会是一位不认识你们的陌生人替你们证婚012---...is it won't be some like, stranger up there who barely knows you.
而会是我  我发誓  我会做得很好012---It'll be me. And I swear, I'll do a really good job.
还有  我爱你们  这对我意义重大012---Plus, y'know I love you guys and it would really mean a lot to me.
这样也蛮酷的012---Might be kind of cool.
我可以吗  好啊  就你吧012---So I can do it? Yeah, you can do it.
好啊  好012---All right! Okay!
好  我要开始准备我的演说了012---Okay-okay, I gotta get started on my speech.
等一下012---Wait a minute.
网络上任命的牧师还是可以做爱吧  对啊  嗯012---Internet ministers can still have sex right? Yeah.
来了012---Coming.
我要找你麻烦012---I have a bone to pick with you.
对  小班学了一个恶作剧012---Yes! Ben learned a little trick.
他是不是  对  是的012---Oh yeah? did he pull the old--? That's right, that's right.
马桶座位上包了保鲜膜012---Saran wrap on the toilet seat...
于是尿尿喷得到处都是012---...so the pee goes everywhere.
哦  那个啊  对  那个012---Oh, that. Yeah, that.
你知道我最恨恶作剧的012---You know I hate practical jokes.
恶作剧低级又愚蠢   我才不要我儿子学这些012---They're mean, they're stupid and I don't want my son learning them.
拜托  马桶包了保鲜膜  你不觉得有一点点好笑吗012---Oh, come on. Saran wrap on the toilet seat? you don't think that just a little funny?
我光着脚012---I was barefoot. Oh.
现在告诉我  你只教了他马桶这一招  对不012---Now tell me, the toilet thing is the only thing you taught him, right?
对012---Yes.
嘿  向乔伊崔比亚尼牧师打招呼吧012---Hey. Say hello to Reverend Joey Tribbiani.

我已经写下我在婚礼要说的话了  要听吗012---Anyway, I started working on what I'm going to say for the ceremony. Want to hear it?

"今天我们齐聚此处  在这个喜悦的场合012---"We are gathered here today on this joyous occasion...
来庆祝摩妮卡和钱德之间特别的爱"012---...to celebrate the special love that Monica and Chandler share.
对012---Huh? Right.
"这是奠基在付出和接受012---It is a love based on giving and receiving...
拥有和分享的爱012---...as well as having and sharing.
他们付出和拥有的爱被分享和接受了012---And the love that they give and have is shared and received.
藉着这样的拥有和付出012---And through this having and giving...
以及分享和接受012---...and sharing and receiving...
我们同样分享爱和拥有012---...we too can share and love and have...
还有接受"012---...and receive."
要不要打电话给喷口水的012---Should we call the spitter?
嘿  瑞秋  嗨012---Ha! Hey, Rachel. Hi.
好个惊喜  你怎么在这儿012---What a surprise. What are you doing here?
我正好在附近012---Well y'know I was just in the neighborhood...

找到他了012---I found him!
好好笑  过来012---Very funny. Come here.
这就是我来找你谈的原因012---That is exactly why I've come here to talk to you, okay?
瑞秋  咖啡要加糖吗  好  那个012---Rach, you want some sugar in your coffee? Yes, but--
我的咖啡要不要加糖012---Do I want sugar in my coffee?
不加糖了  只加牛奶  谢谢012---No, just some milk would be good, Carol. Thanks.
记得我昨天教你的那些东西012---Okay. Remember all that stuff I taught you yesterday?
"记得我昨天教你的那些东西"012---"Remember all that stuff I taught you yesterday?"
不要这样   "不要这样"012---Don't do that. "Don't do that."
你爸爸不喜欢恶作剧  "你爸爸不喜欢恶作剧"012---Seriously, your dad doesn't like pranks. "Seriously, your dad doesn't like pranks."
可恶  "可恶"012---Oh, damn it. "Oh, damn it!"

是  好012---Yeah, okay.
"当我想到这两位付出者  和接受者所分享的爱012---"When I think of the love that these two givers and receivers share...
我禁不住嫉妒  之后一生的拥有和爱012---...I can't help but envy the lifetime ahead of having and loving...
和付出"   我想不出这里要用什么字012---...and giving--" And then I can't think of a good word for right here.
用 "接受" 如何  对012---How about "receiving"? Yes!
乔伊  不是嫌你写得不好012---See, Joe, not that that's not great...
但找熟人朋友证婚的好处012---...but one of the cool things about having somebody we know perform the ceremony...
就是能够和我们贴得更近012---...is that it can be about us.
你可以更有针对性  可以讲  我们的故事012---Y'know, It can be more personal. You can tell stories about us.
好  我可以谈谈伦敦  是在那儿你们俩个搞上了012---Ooh! Ooh! Okay, Maybe I'll talk about London. You know, when you two hooked up.
只是我不会说 "搞上了"012---Only I won't say "hooked up"...
我会说  "他们展开的美好旅程012---...I'll say, "began their beautiful journey...
对了   "是从他们做了开始的"012---There you go. ...by doing it."
乔伊  好吧012---Joe. Okay, all right, um...
所以是怎么开始的呢  你们的双眼越过房间相遇012---So, uh-So how did it happen? Did your eyes meet across the room...
然后你在浴缸里  她在喂你吃草莓012---...And then the next thing y'know you're in the bathtub together and she's feeding you strawberries?
那不是发生在你和伴娘身上的吗  对啊012---Isn't that what happened with you and the bride's maid? Yeah!
我叫它  "伦敦式艳遇"012---I call that "London style."
没发生在我们身上012---No that is not what happened with us.
也许你应该说有  因为"伦敦式艳遇"听来不错012---Ooh, but maybe you should say it is, because "London style" sounds nice.
对012---Yeah.
好吧012---Okay, uh...
那天晚上我很难过  因为有个家伙以为我是罗斯的妈妈012---Well, I was umm, I was really sad that night because this guy thought I was Ross' mom.
钱德对我很好  一直在安慰我012---And then Chandler was really sweet and he consoled me...
而我们确实喝多了  对了  宝贝012---...and we drank too much. Yeah, baby.
我很绅士地陪她走回  旅馆房间  道了晚安012---I was a perfect gentleman and I walked her to her hotel room and said good night.
但那晚上后来呢  晚些时候  这才对  宝贝012---But then, later that night-Yeah, baby.
嘿012---Hey.
可爱的睡衣  真的像在伦敦家里过的多采多姿啊012---Cute P.J.s. Really living it up here in London, huh?
我想不会再有人来  现在已经012---Well I was...I wasn't exactly expecting company after...
9点15分012---9:15.
乔伊在吗012---Is Joey here?
上次我看到他时  他和伴娘在一起还拿着一篮草莓出去了012---Last I saw him he was heading out the door with the bridesmaid and a bucket of strawberries.
你不会还在为那个家伙的话生气吧012---So, uh, you're not still upset about what that guy told you, are you?
你不会吗012---Wouldn't you be?
这是一个很感人的时刻  你又喝了很多012---Well, look it's been a really emotional time y'know, and you've had a lot to drink...
可你必须忘了那事  好吗012---You have to let that go, okay?
你是今晚屋里最美的女人012---I mean you were the most beautiful woman in the room tonight.
真的012---Really?
那还用说  你是在大多数地方  都显得最美的女人012---You kidding? You're the most beautiful woman in most rooms--
喔  喔  怎么了  我们亲嘴了012---Whoa, whoa, whoa. What's going on? You and I just made out!
我们亲嘴了  现在没有012---You and I just made out! Not anymore.
可是我们不能这样的  我知道  我以为会很好玩012---But we don't do that. I know, I thought it would be fun.
你有多醉了012---How drunk are you?
醉得想要你   但还没醉得神志不清012---Drunk enough to know that I want to do this. Not so drunk that you should feel guilty about taking advantage.
不多不少恰恰好012---That's the perfect amount.
你知道哪里奇怪吗  哪里012---You know what's weird? What?
咱们越轨却感觉一点都不奇怪  可不是嘛012---This doesn't feel weird. I know.
你真是接吻高手  我吻过不止四个女人012---You're a really good kisser. Well, I have kissed over four women.
钻到被窝里如何012---Do you wanna get under the covers? Mm-hm.
好啊012---0Kay.
哇  你动作好快012---Wow, you are really fast!
我想你会欣赏速度的  对我来说是个好兆头012---It bodes well for me that speed impresses you.
我们要"裸诚相见"了  对012---We're gonna see each other naked. Yep.
同时做   我数到三012---Do you wanna do it at the same time? Count of three?
一   二   三012---One, two, three.
我想我们的友谊  毫不夸张的说被彻底破坏了012---Well, I think it's safe to say our friendship is effectively ruined.
反正我们本来也没那么亲近012---Eh, we weren't that close anyway. Eh.
乔伊  乔伊  乔伊  是乔伊012---Joey, Joey, Joey. It's Joey.
嘿012---Hey.

不  不  不  没事  我还跟伴娘在一起012---Hey no-no-no-no! It's cool, It's cool! I'll only be a second,I'm still with my bridesmaid.
保险套在哪儿012---I just—Where are the condoms you brought?
在那边  我的袋子里012---They're in my bag over there.
可以给我留一个吗012---...could you leave me one?
给你一个人012---For just you?
对012---Yeah.
好  给你  老兄012---All right. There you go, buddy.
你去疯吧012---Go nuts.
原来是为了那件事用的012---That's what that was?
如果我没留一个给你012---Can you imagine if I hadn't left you that last one?
你们两个可能永远不会在一起012---You two might've never gotten together.
想像一下  如果我照原来计划  送了一个妓女上去会怎样012---Oh, ooh. Can you imagine if I had sent that hooker up to the room like I was gonna?!
就像在天上一样012---It's like it was in the stars. Hmm.
是啊  你们是注定在一起的012---Yeah, totally meant to be.
告诉他你原先那晚是要去找谁的012---Tell him who you originally wanted to hook up with that night.
什么  什么012---What? What?
什么012---What?
你原先是要去找谁的012---Who did you originally want to hook up with?
好吧  拜托  不要生气012---Okay, fine, but please don't be upset.
我那时真的很沮丧  好吗  而且醉得很厉害012---Okay? I was really depressed, okay? And really drunk.
我只想干点毫无意义的傻事  我只想...只想纯做爱  所以012---I just wanted something stupid and meaningless. I just wanted...just sex. So
那晚我到你们房间012---when I went to your room that night...
其实是要找乔伊的012---...I was actually looking for Joey.
好啊  宝贝012---Yeah, baby.
不  宝贝012---No, baby.
哦  我的天012---Oh, my God.
你来找乔伊的012---You came to the room looking for Joey?
你有没有想过要告诉我  没有  我觉得这不重要012---Were you planning on telling me this? No, I didn't think it was important.
这不重要  这不重要012---It's not important? It's not important?
如果没有那个伴娘  你嫁的会是他而不是我012---If it wasn't for a bridesmaid, you'd be marrying him not me!
不  你知道我有多高兴  乔伊不在那里吗012---No! Do you know how unbelievably glad I am that Joey wasn't there that night!
嘿012---Hey!
虽然我是神职人员  可是我还是有感觉的012---I'm a man of the cloth but I still have feelings.
现在你不可能替我们证婚了012---Look there's no way you're doing this wedding now, okay?
什么  不公平  不是我的错012---What? That's not fair. It's not my fault.
我和伴娘在一起012---I was off with my bridesmaid.
而且谁说我会答应的012---And who's to say I would've said yes?
我是说  我会答应的012---I mean, I would've said yes.
钱德  你把这件事看得太严重了012---Chandler look y-y-you are making way too big a deal out of this. all right?
现在不是一切都很好嘛012---Everything worked out okay.
只是很奇怪012---It's just weird,

我很抱歉  没有告诉你012---All right, I'm sorry. I'm sorry I didn't tell you.
听着  我不要你再教我儿子那些鬼东西012---I will be! Listen, I don't want you teaching my son that stuff anymore.

得有人教他这些东西012---Somebody has to teach him this stuff.
我又没有教他任何  正常6岁孩子不该会的东西012---And I haven't taught him anything a normal 6-year-old doesn't know anyway!
好烂  我要走了012---Crap! I gotta go_

就知道一定会天长地久的012---And you just know it's gonna last forever.
这就是你该讲的012---That's what you should say.
什么012---What?
就是你替我们证婚时  那就是你该说的012---When you're marrying us, that's what you should say.
真的嘛  我可以替你们证婚吗012---Really? I could do it?
我希望你替我证婚012---I'd love it if you would do it.
嘿012---Hey.

罗斯  前几天的约会怎么样012---So, Ross, how was your date the other night?
你和她谈起过那次冲洗厕所的奇妙之旅了012---Did you tell her about the magical ride that starts with the flush of every toilet?
尽管笑吧  但她给我留言  说她想再跟我约会012---Laugh all you want, but she left me a message saying she'd like to go out again.
事实上  我正要打电话给她012---Oh. In fact, I'll go call her right now.
我一定会告诉她   我的朋友钱德说012---And I'll make sure and tell her my friend Chandler says...
嘿  钱德  嘿012---Hey, Chandler. Hey.
抱歉昨晚我失约了  我刚好有个约会012---Listen, sorry I didn't stop by last night, but I had a date.
乔伊  那快凌晨一点  就算没过来也没关系012---Uh Joe, when it's 1:00 in the morning and you don't come by? That's okay.
我跟一个辣妹约会  她刚刚搬到对面街012---Well check it out. It was with this really hot girl who just moved in right across the street.
真的吗  她就住在对面街  对012---Really? Right across the street? Yeah.
你什么时候认识她的   两天前012---When did you meet her? Two days ago.
太棒了012---Excellent!
罗斯也认识了个女孩  是吗012---You know, Ross met somebody too. Oh, yeah?
嘿  怎么样012---Hey. How'd it go?
太棒了  我们星期六要再出去玩012---Great. We're going out again Saturday.
但我刚刚发现她也在跟别人约会012---But I just found out she's also seeing some other guy.
真的吗012---Really?
乔伊  如果你是罗斯你会怎么做012---Joe, what would you do if you were in Ross' situation?
我跟他差不多  跟我约会的女孩也在跟别人约会012---Well, I sort of am. I'm dating this girl who's also seeing another guy.
但我一点都不担心012---But I'm not too worried about it.
你不必担心  但相信我  我可不想当你的竞争者012---Well you shouldn't be. Believe me, I wouldn't want to be the guy who's up against you.
那个混蛋一定会输的012---I mean, that doofus is going to lose.
真的太有趣了012---So this is nice.
真希望我能留下来  相信我012---I wish I didn't have to go. Believe me.
但不幸的是我得走了012---But I unfortunately have to.
对了  顺便问下  跟你们约会的女孩叫什么名字012---Oh uh, By the way, what's the name of the girl you're dating?
克丽丝汀莱  再见012---Kristen Leigh. Bye.
很明显  我们之中  只有一个人能继续跟她约会012---Well, obviously, only one of us can keep dating her.
没错  我们该怎么决定012---Obviously. So how do we decide?
好了  我们得客观地来解决这件事012---Well now, let's look at this objectively.
我想我该跟她约会012---I think I should date her.
或是我该跟她约会012---Or I'm the one who dates her.
太有趣了  但是听好了  我跟她约会012---That's interesting. But check this out. I date her.
好吧  但是换个角度来说012---Yeah, I like that. But just to go in another direction--
好吧  这样我们是谈不出结论来的012---Okay. okay. This can go on for a while.
没错  我们该点些吃的  不  乔伊012---Yeah well we should order some food then. No, Joey.
听着  我们为什么不让她来决定呢012---Look, why don't, why don't we just let her decide, okay?
我们都再跟她约会一次012---We'll each go out with her one more time.
看看她更喜欢谁012---And we'll see who she likes best.
听起来很公平012---That sounds fair.
或许我会带她到新开的法国餐厅吃饭012---Maybe I'll take her to that new French restaurant down the street.
等一下  我们得对约会费用设下限制012---Ah yeah. Wait a second. Look we're gonna have to set a spending limit on the date.
我可没有钱带她去高级餐厅吃饭012---I don't have the money to take her to a fancy place like that.
那只有抱歉了  但那是我的约会方式012---Well, sorry. That's what I do on dates.
好吧  我想我也有我的方式012---All right. Well, I guess I'll just have to do what I do on dates.
我们来决定费用限制  好吧012---So let's decide on a spending limit. Yeah.
再加一片012---And a slice...
六块钱012---Six dollars?
我想是一百块  好吧012---I was thinking more like a hundred. Okay.
你能借我94块吗012---Can I borrow 94 dollars?
我知道  你能帮我拿张面纸吗012---I know. Can you hand me a tissue?
你家没有健怡可乐了012---You're out of Diet Coke.
喂012---Hello?
什么  你什么012---What? You what?
你给我听好了  小姐012---You listen here, missy!
什么012---What?
是那个梅根打来的  她订下《摇摆国王》  日期是我们结婚的那一天012---That was that girl Megan. She booked The Swing Kings on the day of our wedding...
还说如果我不把婚纱让给她  我就没有乐团012---...and said that I couldn't have them back unless I gave her the dress!
这么说的话  《尸体》乐队有空了012---Does that mean Carcass is available?
我该怎么办  那件婚纱  就是我一直想要的012---What am I gonna do? That's the dress! That is "the" dress!
钱德喜欢那个乐团  我该怎么办啊012---Chandler wants the band. What do I do?
想办法说服他放弃  那怎么做呢012---Well just figure out a way to talk him out of it. How?
你家卫生纸用完了012---You're out of toilet paper!
嗨  怎么样012---Hey. What's up?
我过来祝你约会顺利啊012---I just wanted to come by and y'know,wish you good luck on your date.
谢谢  你们约几点012---Oh thanks. What time are you meeting her?
我们在葛兰梅西餐厅  订了八点的位子012---We have 8:00 reservations at Grand Merci Bistro.
时间只剩20分钟  你最好快去换衣服012---Wow, that's in 2O minutes. You'd better get dressed.
我已经换好衣服了  太好了012---I am dressed. Oh, well, good.
对我来说012---For me.
这是什么  你在敷脸012---What's this? Did you give yourself a facial?
我用油性护肤霜012---I have an oily T-zone.
好吧  兄弟012---Okay, dude.
你送克丽丝汀花  没错012---Hey, you sent Kristen flowers? That's right.
你花了一百块  你把钱花光了  你完蛋了012---You spent 100 dollars. That's the limit. You're screwed!
我在约会前送她花  所以技术上来说012---Actually, I sent the flowers before the actual date, so technically...
技术上来说  我没有犯规  谢谢你来看我012---...technically, I didn't break any rules. Thanks for stopping by though.
你要真的那么玩  我也可以犯规012---Oh-oh! So that's the way it's gonna be? Yeah I can break the rules too. y'know!
那你打算怎么办  我不知道012---Oh yeah? What are you gonna do? I don't know.
为什么我一点都不讶异  告诉你罗斯  我不会放过你的012---Why am I not surprised? Y'know what Ross? I'm not gonna let you get away with this!
我想你没有太多的选择  我们走着瞧012---I don't think you have much choice. Well we'll see!
再见  对  再见012---Bye-bye. Yeah, bye-bye.
嘿  只要薄薄地敷一层就好012---Hey! So just a light layer?
知道  只要敷这里跟这里012---Yeah, just here and there.
乔伊又把肉酱滴在栏杆上了012---Joey got meat sauce on the banister again.
摇摆音乐太落伍了012---Yeah, swing music is so out.
菲比  他要在这房间里才听得到012---Phoebe, he's gotta be in the room for that to work.
你们到底在说什么012---What are you guys talking about?
我们在谈《摇摆国王》012---Well umm, we were just talking about the y'know, the Swing Kings ...
讨论到底该不该请他们来012---...and just wondering whether y'know, they were the right way to go.
有一次我去参加  请摇摆乐团来表演的婚礼012---Yeah, I went to a wedding once where they had swing music...
两个月后他们就离婚了012---...and two months later the couple got divorced.
我倒不是说这其中必有联系012---And now I'm not saying there's any connection here y'know,...
但他们的确告诉我  那是他们离婚的原因012---...but they did tell me that's why they got divorced.
但我喜欢摇摆音乐012---But I love swing music!
但《摇摆国王》012---Yeah but The Swing Kings?
他们烂到有人听他们的演唱会死掉  他们就那么死了012---y'know they suck so much that people actually die at their concerts. They just stop living.
我只知道摩妮卡跟我  去看他们演唱时非常开心012---Look all I know is when Monica and I went to see them, we had fun.
事实上还有一个原因012---And there's another reason too.
是什么原因  我不想说012---Well, what is the other reason? I don't want to say.
你非说不可  或许它很愚蠢012---Well, you have to, because maybe it's stupid.
摩妮卡跟我  随着他们的音乐起舞时012---Well it's just while Monica and I were dancing to them...
那是我第一次知道012---...it was the first time I knew that...
你就是我想一辈子共舞的女人012---...you were the woman that I wanted to dance all my dances with.
糟糕012---Oh, crap.
我们的桌子  马上就准备好  太棒了012---So they said our table will be ready in just a few minutes. Oh, great.
你的背好点了吗  没事了012---Is your back feeling better? Oh yeah, it's fine.
我猜肌肉越多012---I guess, ahem, the more muscles you have...
就越可能抽筋012---...the more they can spasm out of control.
克丽丝汀  乔伊012---Kristen? Joey!
嗨  嗨012---Hi. Hi.
你来这里做什么  我喜欢这个地方012---What are you doing here? Oh I like this place.

你上过电视或其它什么吗012---Are you on TV or something?
乔伊不喜欢提这件事012---Well Joey doesn't like to talk about it...
但他主演过《我们的日子》012---...but he's one of the stars of Days of Our Lives.
没错  你不是演女人吗012---That's right. That's right. Don't you play a woman?
那是被困在男人身体里的女人012---A woman in a man's body.
这还好点012---Much better.
你知道吗  罗斯  真有趣  因为我也觉得你很眼熟012---So y'know Ross it's funny, because you look familiar to me too.
你结过婚吗012---Have you ever been married?
是的  我结过婚012---Yes, I have.

趁女伴去上洗手问  偷吃掉她的食物吗012---...that when the girl goes to the bathroom, you eat some of her food?
你说服务生吃掉我的蟹饼012---You said the waiter ate my crab cake.
罗斯  你的第一段婚姻  为什么会结束012---Yeah. So, Ross, well now—why did that first marriage break up? Hm?
因为你前妻是异性恋  还是同性恋啊012---Was it because the woman was straight or because she was a lesbian?
你们两个认识吗  不认识012---Do you two know each other? No.
只是罗斯看起来像是  会跟有同性恋倾向的女人012---No. It just seems like Ross is the kind of a guy that would marry a woman...
结婚后  逼得她非得出柜的男人012---...on the verge of being a lesbian and then push her over the edge.
等一下  你不是淋病海报上的那个男的吗012---Wait a minute! Were you on a poster for gonorrhea?
你跟猴子同床共枕过吧012---Have you ever slept in the same bed with a monkey?

猴子迷012---Monkey-lover!
你觉得她是什么时候离开的012---When do you think we lost her?
可能是淋病那一段吧012---Probably around "gonorrhea."
甜心  我回来了  别进来012---Hi, honey, I'm home! Don't come in here!
怎么了  你的另一个男朋友在里面吗012---Why, do you have another boyfriend in there?
不  我们只会在他家鬼混012---No. We only mess around at his place.
虽然是我开的头  但我开始担心了  你能出来吗012---Y'know it's funny, I started it, but now it's scaring me, so could you come out here, please?
不行  我正在穿婚纱012---No. I'm wearing a wedding dress.
你买到婚纱了  太棒了012---You got a wedding dress? That's great.
对  但我要把它退回去  那我为什么不能看呢012---Yeah, but I'm not keeping it. Well then why can't I see it?
我猜应该可以012---Oh. I guess you can.

真的吗012---Really?
没错  那是我见过的最丑的婚纱012---Yeah. That's like the most ugliest dress I've ever seen.
你为什么要把它退回去012---Why do you have to return it?
因为它真的不合适012---Oh because it doesn't really fit.
还有  我订了《摇摆国王》012---Oh, by the way, I booked The Swing Kings.
那真的是太棒了  谢谢012---Oh, that's great. Great. Thanks.
但那件婚纱可怕极了012---But that dress, I mean, it's like, ugh, terrible.
真想把它从你身上扯下来  好吧012---It makes me want to rip it right off you. Okay.
但你不可以把它弄破012---Okay! But you can't rip it.
或许弄破点也没关系  好012---Well, maybe a little. Okay.
你们想看看婚礼上  演唱歌曲的清单吗012---Hey, guys, you want to look at the song list for the wedding?
怎么了012---Guys?
我还以为你会去一整天012---I thought you'd be gone all day.

对不起  或许我应该  让你们这些小女生独处一下012---I’m sorry. I'm sorry. I should probably leave you girls alone.

恩斯特穆伯拉特假设  迅猛龙受到威胁时012---And Ernest Muhlbrat who first hypothesized that the velociraptor, when threatened...
他会把颈部肌肉张开  发出尖锐的叫声012---...would expand its collar and emit a high-pitched noise...
将敌人吓跑012---...to frighten off its predator.
路易斯  什么事012---Yes, Mr. Lewis?
他是怎么叫的012---What kind of noise?
他会发出尖锐吵杂的声音012---Just a high-pitched, intimidating noise.
那到底是什么声音啊012---But like how?
我们不是很清楚012---Well, we-we don't know for sure.
但我想  应该是这样的012---But in my head, it sounded something like this, uh:
当然了  这只是一种推测012---Of course, this is just conjecture.
好了  今天的课就上到这里012---Ahem, okay. That's, uh, That's all for today.

你得答对60%才能过关012---Well, you need 6O percent to pass.
我得了几分   7分012---What'd I get? Seven.
不算太好012---That's not so good.
不  不好  太糟了  奈德  到底怎么回事012---No, no, it's not. What happened there, Ned?
或许你可以放我一马  我恋爱了012---Well, maybe you can cut me some slack. I'm sort of in love.
很抱歉  但那真的不是我的问题012---Well I'm sorry, but that's really not my problem.
我爱上了你012---I'm in love with you.
这好像又跟我有一点关系了012---Well, that brings me in the loop a little.
看么  这就是我考砸的原因  我没办法专心上课012---See, that's why I did so bad on this test. I'm having a hard time concentrating.
你站在讲台上讲课的时候012---When you're up there and you're teaching...
表情是那么地严肃012---...and your face gets all serious...
你看起来好帅  当你穿着紧身套头毛衣时012---...you look so good. When you wear that tight little turtleneck sweater--

菲比  我订婚了012---Phoebe, I'm engaged.
我是说让你问问他的电话号码  以防万一012---I'm just saying, get his number, just in case.
要是钱德发生什么意外  丧失了性能力012---But if Chandler is in an accident and can't perform sexually, you know...
他可能要你找个情人  满足他无法满足你的那个部分012---...then he would want you to take a lover to satisfy the needs he can no longer fulfill.
嗨  喔012---Hi. I-Oh.
我是不是应该先告诉你012---Can I just tell you something? Um--
我真的受宠若惊  但我订婚了012---I'm very flattered, but, uh, I'm engaged. Ha, ha.
这还真是有点尴尬012---Wow, uh-This is kind of embarrassing.
但实际上  我是想过来跟你朋友打个招呼012---I was actually coming over to talk to your friend.

这没有什么大不了的  我也会拿着洗发精的瓶子那么做012---It's not a big deal. I do that too, with my shampoo bottle.

你练习的是什么奖  葛莱美奖012---What award are you practicing for? Grammy.

太好了  对啊012---Aw, that's great. Yeah.
所以就算你没得奖  你也有机会上台012---So you'll definitely get on stage even if you don't win.
你认为我不会得奖  你当然会得奖012---You-You don't think I'm gonna win? Of course I do.
但最受欢迎的死而后生奖  竞争很激烈012---But, you know, Favorite Returning Character is a tough category, Joey.
我是说你要跟一个从火葬场死里逃生的家伙竞争012---I mean, you're up against the guy who survived his own cremation.
是的  我知道或许可能会输  只是012---Yeah. No, I know I might not win. But it's just...
我从来没获得过提名  我太想得到这个奖了012---I've never even been nominated before. I want it so much.
乔伊  或许你会得奖012---Well Joey, and you'll probably get it.
但你应该开始练习  万一失败了应该有得体的表现012---But you should probably start practicing your "gracious-loser" face.
当摄影机拍到你时  你得表现出失望的样子012---Y'know when like, the cameras are on you and you wanna look disappointed...

太棒了  我们整晚一直注视着彼此012---Oh, great! We couldn't keep our eyes off each other all night.
每一次那个  你知道  他都俯下身来抚摸我的头发跟脖子012---Then every once and a while y'know, he'd lean over and stroke my hair, and then touch my neck.
好吧  别这样  菲比  你让我浑身发麻012---Okay, stop it. Phoebe, You're getting me all tingly.
我只能想着  他要吻我了吗  要吻我了吗012---All I could think of was, y'know, "Is he gonna kiss me? Is he gonna kiss me?"
他吻了你吗  我是个淑女啊  摩尼卡  我接吻的时候不说话012---And did he? I'm a lady, Monica. I don't kiss and tell.
但这个吻痕说明了一切012---But this hickey speaks for itself.
好了  我知道了  我知道了012---Okay, okay, I got it. I got it.
我真的好喜欢他  感觉上像是我今天喝了十杯酒012---I just like him so much that I just feel like I've had 1O drinks today.
而我只喝了六杯012---And I've only had six.
我第一次跟钱德约会后  就再也没有那样的感觉了012---Oh. You know, I haven't had that feeling since I first starting going out with Chandler.
我永远都不会再有那样的感觉了  你的口气像个男人012---Wow, I'm never gonna have that feeling again am I? You sound like a guy.
不  男人会说 "我永远都不能再跟别人上床了"012---Heh. No, a guy would be saying, "I'm never gonna get to sleep with anyone else." Heh.
我永远都不能再跟别人上床了012---Oh, my God. I'm never gonna sleep with anyone else!

我再也不会有初吻012---I mean, I'm never gonna have a first kiss again.
你会有最后的吻别012---You'll have a last kiss.
我能问你一件事吗  有男人喜欢过你吗012---Can I ask you something? You ever had a guy have a crush on you?
那就是你要帮我打领带的原因012---Is that why you wanted to tie my tie?
我班上的学生说他爱上我了012---There's this kid in my class who said he's in love with me.
哇012---Whoa! Yeah.

这是怎么回事啊  难道是我浑身散发出012---What-What-What is it? Am I giving out some kind of...
一股性感教授的气质吗012---...a sexy-professor vibe?
现在看起来不像012---Not right now.
重点是我的天生丽质  让他期中考试不及格012---It-it—The point is, my natural charisma has made him fail his midterm.
我替那个孩子感到难过012---Aw, see now I feel bad for the kid.
我也曾经暗恋过老师  那个真的很难受012---I had a crush on a teacher once, and it was so hard, you know.
我没办法专心上课  每次他看着我时  我都会脸红012---I couldn't concentrate and I blushed every time he looked at me.
你还记得19岁时的恋爱滋味吧012---Come on, you remember what it's like to be 19 and in love.
我是可以放他一马  太棒了012---Yeah, guess I can cut him some slack. Yeah.
你怎么忘记那个老师的  我没有012---How'd you get over that teacher? I didn't.
我跟他上床了012---I got under him.
问题解决了012---Problem solved.

好的  再见  再见012---All right. Bye. Bye.
我们在门口说再见  不想太招摇012---We said goodbye at the door so as not to flaunt our new love.
菲比  没关系  你不必顾虑到我012---Phoebe, it's okay. You don't have to tip toe around me.
我已经想过了  你知道吗012---I've been thinking about it, and um-You know what?
我可以接受没有心动感觉的恋爱生活012---I'm okay about not having that new-relationship feeling.
我已经开始想你了  我也会想你012---I miss you already! I miss you too!
看见了  这就是我说的  真的太棒了  但我不会拿我的幸福跟你交换012---See, that's what I mean. I mean that, That's great, but I wouldn't trade in what I have for that.
我会一辈子跟钱德相守012---I mean, I'm gonna be with Chandler for the rest of my life.
那会让我觉得幸福012---That's what makes me happy. Mm-hm.
嗨  亲爱的  过来  过来坐这  我和菲比正在谈012---Hey, sweetie, come here, Come sit down. Hey Phoebe and I were just talking about how our relationship is...

拜托  瑞秋  没有人看到我把它拿走  整个桌子上都是奖杯012---Come on, Rach. No one saw me take it. There was a whole table full of them.

我可以把那个刮掉012---I can scratch that right off.
乔伊  这样是不对的  你得把它还回去012---Joey, no, this is wrong. You have to take it back.
你不会想这样把奖杯拿回家  你真的有演戏天分012---Okay? You don't wanna win an award this way. You're very talented.

但我希望你能帮我改成绩012---...but I was kind of hoping you could change my grade.

对  因为我爱上你了012---Yeah. I'm all in love with you and stuff.
你可以帮我改成绩吗  不行012---So could you change my grade? No!
为什么你帮奈德改成绩012---Well, why not? You changed Ned's grade.
那不一样  因为他真的爱上我了012---Well, that's different, okay? Because he was actually in love with me.
不  他才没有呢  他只是在耍你012---No, he's not! He's totally yanking your chain.
他已经用这一招对付过其他三个教授了012---He's done this with three other teachers.

我得跟他谈这件事  不  这是你最后的选择012---I've just gotta talk to him about all this. No that is the last thing you wanna do.
为什么  因为你要嫁给他012---Why? Because you're marrying him!
你得说清楚  菲比012---You gotta help me out here, Pheebs.
我从来没有订过婚  也没有真正结过婚012---All right, I've never been engaged and I've never really been married.
我只能告诉你我妈跟我说的话012---But I can only tell you what my mother told me.
当你对一段关系有疑虑  害怕或焦虑时012---Whenever you have doubts or fears or anxieties about a relationship...
别跟你的丈夫沟通这些问题012---...do not communicate them to your husband.
所以  我不该跟我要共度一生的男人012---So I'm not supposed to share my doubts and fears...
分享我的疑虑跟恐惧012---...with the guy I'm spending the rest of my life with?
没错  就是那样012---That is correct. Yes.
你应该把那件事放在心里012---You're supposed to take all of that stuff and put it in a little box in your mind...
永远不再提012---...and then lock it up tight.
那是你妈妈告诉你的  对012---Your mother told you this? Yes.
那个结了很多次婚  在你十三岁时就自杀了的女人012---The woman that got married a bunch of times and killed herself when you were 13?
我的天啊  你说的对012---Oh, my God, you're right.
去啊  去告诉钱德  快点  免得太迟了012---Go! Go tell Chandler. Hurry, before it's too late!
等一下  这是不是说你对做爱不感兴趣了012---Wait, no! Does this also mean that putting out doesn't get you love?
不敢相信我要跟洁西卡艾许丽碰面  等下  等下012---I can't believe I'm gonna meet Jessica Ashley! Wait, wait.
瑞秋  冷静一点  好吗  我跟这个女人一起工作012---Please be cool, okay? I work with this woman.

就这样么  你不打算  你不把它摆在柜子里或者其他什么上吗012---Well, that-that-that's it? You're gonna, you're not gonna put it on your shelf or anything?
不  我只想把真正的奖杯摆在柜子里  对不起012---No, I try to save that for real awards. Now if you'll excuse me?
要把它拿回去吗  那当然012---Take it back? Absolutely.
对  做得好012---Yeah, you do.
甜心  我们快结婚了012---Honey? As we get closer to the wedding... Hm?
有什么事你想跟我分享吗012---...Is there anything you'd like to talk about or share?
好吧  我觉得桌上的装饰太大了012---Okay. Well, I think the centerpieces are too big.
你错了  桌上的装饰刚刚好012---You're wrong. The centerpieces are fine.
你害怕过吗  有点  它们真的很大012---Do you ever get scared at all? Kind of. They're really big.
你不害怕自己再也不会有新的浪漫关系了012---Doesn't it ever freak you out that you're never gonna be with anybody new again?
什么012---What?
只是012---Just--
我非常爱你  只是012---I love you so much. Just--
有时候我会很难过  我无法再有那样的感觉012---It's just sometimes it bothers me that I'm never gonna have that feeling.

对我来说心动的感觉就是  我们会共度余生012---Look, for me the rush is knowing that we are gonna be together for the rest of our lives.
真的吗  对012---Really? Well, yeah.

导演被认为是  下下个马丁史柯西斯012---Oh, and the director is supposed to be the next-next Martin Scorsese.
"下下个"012---The "next-next"?
来自芝加哥的那个家伙被认为是  下一个马丁史柯西斯012---Yeah, there's this guy from Chicago who's supposed to be the next Martin Scorsese, all right?
这个导演在他之后012---But then this guy's right after him.

我的天  只有一个问题012---Oh, my God. There's just one thing.
你对正面全裸有问题吗012---Do you have a problem with full-frontal nudity?
你开玩笑  我租过的电影都有正面全裸镜头012---Are you kidding me? I never rent a movie without it!
哦012---Oh.
好  我再回你电话012---Uh, okay, let me call you back.
怎么回事  电影里需要我全裸012---What's the matter? They want me to be totally naked in the movie!
哇  是啊012---Wow. I know.
我祖母会看到的  祖母还得排队才看的到012---My grandmother's gonna see this. Grandma's gonna have to get in line.
老友记  第七季  第19集   罗斯和摩妮卡的表妹012---Friends  S07E19  The One With Ross and Monica's Cousin
婚礼就快到了  你紧张吗012---Hey the Wedding's so close. Are you getting nervous?
紧张  不过我多少也有些盼着它赶紧结束012---Yeah, but a part of me also can't wait 'til it's over.
钱德和我决定  婚礼前不做爱的012---Chandler and I have this pact not to have sex again until the wedding.
"无性条约"  嗯012---A "no sex" pact, huh?
我和全美每位女性  都有一份这个合约012---I actually have one of those going on with every woman in America.
菲比  你能帮我整理客房吗012---Hey Phoebe, will you give me a hand I gotta making up the guest bedroom?
表妹凯西要来和我们住几天012---Hey, Cousin Cassie is coming to stay with us a few days.
凯西  我很久没看到她了012---Cassie? Wow, I haven't seen her for like forever.
她是不是还带着芭比娃娃到处跑012---I wonder if she still carries that a Barbie everywhere she goes.
罗斯  她25岁了  所以呢  我还是012---Ross, she's 25 years old. So what! I still have--
哦  你大概是对的012---No you're probably right.
嘿  嘿012---Hi. Hey.
菲比  我能在这儿跟你谈点事吗012---Pheebs, can I talk to you over here for a second?
好啊012---Yeah.
狡猾的家伙012---Subtle, guys.

就算是吧  别破坏气氛  至少假装不知道啊012---Ha, Well okay, Well don't ruin it! Just play along, at least.
好吧  对不起012---Okay. Sorry. Okay.
天啊  我们还要替她办告别单身女子派对012---Oh, my God. We have to throw her a shower?
嘿  那部影片你怎么决定的012---Hey! What'd you decide to do about the movie?
我不知道012---I don't know.
看起来不像个色情片  这是一个严肃  正统的电影  你知道012---It's not like it's porn. This is a serious, legitimate movie. Y'know?
这个故事里的裸戏很重要012---And the udity's really important to the story.
你也是这么说色情电影的012---That's what you say about porn.
你说的对   也许我都不必回复他们012---You're right. Maybe I shouldn't even go on the callback.
不  你应该去  很多大明星都演过裸戏012---No, No you should. A lot of major actors do nude scenes.
我是说这是个当电影明星的机会  别错过啊012---I mean the chance to star in a movie? Come on!
是真的  我只有一场裸戏  再说故事听起来真的很不错012---Well that's true. And I'm only naked in one scene. Plus it sounds really great.
我的角色是个天主教徒   和一位犹太女孩恋爱了012---My character's Catholic. He falls in love with a Jewish girl.
我们一起私奔  却陷在了大雨中012---Who run away together and they get caught in this big rainstorm.
于是我们躲进谷仓  脱掉彼此的衣服  拥抱在一起012---So we go into this barn, undress each other and hold each other.
真的很甜蜜而温柔012---It's really sweet and tender.
那是啊  每个人都看到你那玩意了012---Plus, everyone is gonna see your thing.
我们什么时候能开这个告别单身女子派对啊012---Well when can we have this shower?
她有这么多事要做  我们只有两个选择012---She has so much going on, we have only two options.
星期五  那只剩两天了012---We have Friday. Well that's only two days away.
另外一个选择呢  昨天012---What is the other option? Yesterday.
如果我们昨天就办了  问题解决了012---Well, if we make it yesterday, woo-hoo, we're done.
天啊  菲比  这不可能  我们不可能在星期五办012---Oh my God Phoebe, this is impossible! We can't do this by Friday.
要找地点  邀请客人  买好食物012---We have to find a place, We have to invite people! get food.
太多事要做  不可能  办不到012---There's just too much to do. It's impossible! We cannot do it!
办不到  瑞秋  镇静下来012---We cannot do it! Rachel, Calm down!
好  抱歉  你是对的  你是对的  抱歉012---Okay. I'm sorry, you're right. you're right. I'm sorry.
镇静下来  女人012---Just calm down, woman!
菲比  我已经  已经镇静下来了012---Phoebe, I already. I already did.
那好  那我需要镇静012---Oh okay. All right, then I need to calm down a little.
我认为如果组织得当  我们是能办成的012---Okay. Okay. I think we can do this if we just get organized. All right?
有两天来计划这个派对012---Uh-huh. We have two days to plan this party.
做决定要快012---We just need to make fast decisions. Mm-hm.
好  要在哪里办012---Okay? All right, where will we have it?
在这里  什么时间  4点整  食物012---Um, here. What time? Four o'clock. Food?
小三明治和茶  好极了  好像摩妮卡012---Finger sandwiches and tea. Ooh, great. Very Monica.
还有辣椒  这就太过头了012---And chili. Ah, you went one too far.
花还是气球  两个都要012---Uh, flowers or balloons? Both.
我们要付钱的  都不要012---We're paying for this. Neither.
主题选什么呢  "肌肤之爱"012---Um, what should we do for the theme? "Lusts of the Flesh."
什么  我不知道  牛仔主题怎么样012---What? I don't know. Cowboy theme?
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
我很高兴我们决定婚礼前不上床012---I'm really glad we decided not to sleep together before the wedding.
我也是012---Oh, boy. Me too.
我在想  如果我们大吵一架012---You know, I was thinking, if we had a big fight--
分手几个小时012---Mm-hm. ...and, uh, we broke up for a few hours.
技术上来说  我们就可以上床了012---Yeah. Technically, we could have sex again.
你说呢  专横独裁的家伙012---What do you think, bossy and domineering?
婚礼取消了  肥胖幼稚的家伙012---The Wedding's off, sloppy and immature.
我也正有此意  走吧012---That's me. Come on. Okay.
等等  我们不能这么做  凯西在客房  我们要一起出去吃中餐012---Okay. But wait. we can't. My Cousin Cassie is in the guest room. We're supposed to have lunch.
甩掉她  执拗尖锐的人012---Well get rid of her, obsessive and shrill.
尖锐  婚礼照常012---Shrill? The wedding is back on.
我听到有人讲话  你一定是钱德012---I thought I heard voices. You must be Chandler.
嗨  很高兴认识你  很高兴认识你012---Hi. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you too.
你准备好要走了吗   好了012---So, are you ready to go? Yeah.
钱德  我跟你一起去012---Chandler? I'll be right with you.
凯西必须去住你家  为什么012---Cassie needs to stay at your place. What-Why?
因为这位 "变态人"   一直盯着她看012---Because "Pervie Perverson" over here can't stop staring at her.
什么  钱德  她是我们的表妹012---What?! Chandler, she's our cousin!
我没有盯着她看  我只是在专心倾听012---I wasn't staring at her. Okay? I was just listening intently.
做一位好的聊天者  看着我012---It's called being a good conversationalist. Watch.
说话012---Say something.
你看着南面8英寸以外的地方012---You were staring about eight inches south of there.
好吧  她可以来我家住012---Fine. She can stay at my place.
顺便问下  凯西现在长成什么样子了012---By the way, what-what does Cassie even look like now?
就像玛丽莲阿姨012---She looks exactly like Aunt Marilyn. Huh.
玛丽莲阿姨会来参加婚礼吗012---So this Aunt Marilyn, is she coming to the wedding?
别惹我发火012---Wafer-thin ice.
嘿  我回来了012---Hey, I'm back.
嗨  乔伊012---Hi, Joey.
那我要不要再演一遍那场戏啊012---Uh, so, will I be reading the same scene again?
其实  我们本来要打电话给你  你今天不用来这儿012---Actually, I tried to call you. You didn't need to come today.
太好了012---Oh, great.
我会是这个角色的最佳人选  不过随你便012---Y'know I'd have been perfect for this part. but whatever!
谢谢你们做了个错误的决定  这会毁了你们的电影  再见012---Y'know, thanks for making a bad decision and ruined your movie. Good day!
等等  乔伊  你不需要来这儿  因为导演昨天看了你的带子非常喜欢012---Wait Joey! You didn't need to come down because the director saw your tape from yesterday and loved it.
下台鞠躬012---And scene.
呀  很好玩吧012---Huh? Wasn't that fun?
即席表演012---We did a little improv there. Yeah!
你刚才在说012---So, you-You were saying?
导演们认为你很适合  明天想见你012---Well, the director thinks you're really right for the part and wants to meet you tomorrow.
哇  当然  太好了012---Wow. Sure. That's great.
你的经纪人说你对裸戏没问题012---Oh and your agent said you're okay with the nudity.
对  没错  只要是看着很有格调012---Yeah! Yeah, sure. just long as it's handled tastefully.
而且谷仓里不要太冷就行012---And that barn is not too cold.
好极了  还有一件事012---Terrific. Well, uh, there's one more thing.
导演希望电影里  每一样东西都看上去真实可信012---Uh... Uh, it's really important to the director that everything in this movie is authentic.
所以你和莎拉的性爱场面012---Yeah and so in your love scene with Sarah...
她说她从没见过  非犹太人的裸体男子012---...she talks about how she's never seen a naked man who wasn't Jewish.
所以012---So...
所以怎样012---So, what?
导演坚持演出这个角色的人012---So, uh, well, the director is insisting that whoever play that part...
必须是从解剖学角度上来看012---...be authentically, uh, anatomically...
不是个犹太人  你知道我在说什么012---...not Jewish. You know what I'm saying?
知道012---Yes!
不知道  你说什么012---No. What?
在那时的意大利  一个天主教移民应该没有012---An Italian Catholic immigrant at this time would not be...
割包皮012---Bar mitzvah-ed?
那么说要得到这个角色  你就不能割过那个  对012---So to get this part you can't be-Nope.
可你其实割了  对012---But you are? Yep.
但你告诉他们  你没有割过  对012---But you told them you weren't? That's right.
哇啊  哇啊012---Wow. Wow.
那这就全完了  没有什么可努力的余地了012---And it's definitely all gone? There's nothing there to work with?
你在想什么  我不知道  我想得到这个角色012---What were you thinking? I don't know. I really want this part.
而且他们说不管试镜时问什么  都回答是012---And they tell you no matter what you get asked at an audition you say yes.
如果要你骑马  你就说会骑012---Like if-if they want you to ride a horse, you tell 'em you can
回头再去学012---And just figure out how to do it later.
乔伊  这和学会骑马不一样  这就像是学习如何012---Joey! This is not like learning to ride a horse. This is like learning to...
让衣服自己长出衣领来012---...grow a turtleneck.
我知道  我知道  行了吗  明天我去见导演时012---I know, I know! okay? And apparently tomorrow, when I go in to meet the director...
必须脱掉衣服  让他们检查我的身子012---...I have to take off my clothes so  that they can see what my body looks like.
我的天  那你怎么办啊012---Oh, my God. What are you gonna do?
看来我必须打给我的经纪人  告诉她我没法演012---I just have to call my agent and tell her I can't do the part.
除非012---Unless...
除非什么012---Unless what?
这听起来可能有些疯狂  不过我们也许可以做点012---Well, this may sound crazy, but there may be something we could...
造型012---...fashion.
像什么  我还没想好  不过  嗯012---Like what? Well, I'm not sure yet, but, um...
我突然有个念头  我在想012---...off the top of my head, I'm thinking...
用双面胶和某一些午餐肉来做012---...double-sided tape and some sort of luncheon meat.
嘿  我有个派对主题的好点子了012---Hey! I've got a great idea for party favors for the shower. Okay,
我们找点桃木盒子  刻上每个人的名字012---we get some uh mahogany boxes and carve everyone's names in them.
在里面放着每个人的出生石012---and inside is everyone's individual birth stone.
好  好012---Okay. Okay.
好吧  那你负责这个012---All right, you take care of that. Okay.
还有  派对就在明天  我们还没有宾客名单012---And meanwhile, the party's tomorrow and we still don't have a guest list.
好  好吧  我们知道谁会来  有我  你要来吗012---Okay. Okay! Well okay, Who do we know that's coming? Me. Are you?
嘿  怎么样啊012---Hey. Hey, what's up Mon?
我在替乔伊弄点东西  可以搜一下你的冰箱吗012---Well uh, I'm trying to making something for Joey. Do you mind if I raid your fridge?
请便012---Have at it.
好  火鸡肉  没用012---Okay. All right. Turkey? Mm, that won't work.
起司  没用012---Cheese? That won't work.
橄榄面包  希望这没用012---Olive loaf? I hope that won't work.
你在替他做三明治吗012---Are you making him a sandwich?
不  像是鸡肉卷012---No, it's, um, more like a wrap.
好  我要走了012---Okay, so, um, I'm gonna go, guys.
你们可以继续讨论  要送我什么礼物012---I guess you can get back to deciding on what to get me for a present!
我们要送她礼物012---We have to get her a present?
好吧  看我拿到什么012---Okay, but look. Look at what I got.
她的通讯录  我们有宾客名单了012---It's her address book. We have a guest list.
天啊  你好厉害  你从她皮包里拿的012---Oh my God you're amazing. Did you pull that out of her purse?
嗯  还有一点派对的启动资金012---Uh-huh. And a little seed money for the party.
凯西012---Cassie?
嘿  罗斯  嘿012---Hey, Ross. Hi. ha, ha.
好久不见012---It's been so long!
上一次我看到你时012---Last time I saw you...
你正忙着收帐篷好去看绝地武士012---...you were setting up your tent in line to see Return of the Jedi.
对  没错012---Oh, Oh, uh, that's right.
这么说你那天看见我了  我还以为你没看见呢012---So-so you did see me that day. Because it seemed like you didn't.
对不起  没关系  来来  请进012---Yeah, sorry about that. It's okay. Come, come on in.
谢谢你让我住在这儿  我是说摩妮卡那儿也不错012---Thanks for letting me stay here. I mean Monica's place was nice.
只是她的未婚夫老是盯着我看012---But her fiancee sure stares a lot.
我的天  你学钱德学得真像012---Oh, my God! You do a great Chandler!
我很会模仿别人表情的012---Uh-huh. Yeah, I have a knack for impressions.
也许等我们熟一点  你也可以学我012---Well, maybe after we get re-acquainted, uh, you could do me.
好  不012---Yeah. No!
凯西  你的 你的好吃吗012---Cassie, how you--? How you doing on that...
热狗012---hot dog.
我吃完了  感谢上帝012---I'm all done. Thank God.
我记得我们最后一次见面  是我们父母一起租下那栋海滨别墅012---I guess the last time we really hung out was when our parents rented that beach house together.
哦  对  没错  记得那时012---Oh, right, right. Ooh, remember the time...
我把你按倒在地   搔你痒把你咯吱哭了012---...l, uh, pinned you down and tickled you until you cried?
我们现在大了  不能那么做了012---We're probably too old to do that now.
我一直都记得那个夏天  我就是那时长了这些雀斑的012---I'll always remember that summer. because it's when I got all of these freckles.
嗯哼  还有  我也一直都记得那个夏天012---Uh-huh! Uh-huh! And-And I'll always remember that summer...
因为那时我才意识到我们是亲戚012---...because that's when I realized that we are related.
你长那么大才明白过来啊012---It took you that long to figure it out, huh?
我是有点反应慢了012---Well I'm, I'm a little slow.
就像我们的孩子也可能会这样子012---Just as our children would be.
嗨  嗨012---Hi. Hi.

把这个拿走好了012---Well maybe we'll just take that one away.
我也做了一个有毛的  不过那是给我自己的012---I also did a little something in fur, but, uh, that's really just for me.
那么  你干吗不进屋去试试这些玩意  我们就知道哪些有用012---Okay. So, why don't you go into your room and try these on? We'll get a better idea of what's gonna work.

现在两个都没了012---and now you don't have either.
我们全搞砸了012---We ruined everything. Ugh.
不  等一下  没有搞砸  你们做的非常好012---Well no, wait a minute, that's not true. No, what did, that was really sweet.

大四的时候  有一天晚上  我们去参加舞会012---It was one night, senior year, and we went to a party...
喝了很多桑格利亚调酒  你知道  最后012---...had a lot of sangria, and you know, ended up...
我们接吻了012---...kissing for a bit.
我有两任老婆是同性恋了012---So that's two of my wives.
老友记  第七季  第20集  同性之吻012---Friends  S07E20  The One With Rachel's Big Kiss
好  乐队在这儿  酒吧在这儿012---Okay, so this is where the band is. And this is where the bar is.
这些大头针上都有人名  瑞秋  你在这里012---And all these pins have people's names on them. And Rach, here you are.
哦  哇012---Oh, wow!
为什么不给我一杯曼哈顿  把我挪到这里012---Why don't we just take me and put me with a Manhattan in my hand...
和可爱的男酒保聊天012---...talking to the cute bartender.
这些大头针不是用来玩的  对吧012---These pins aren't for playing, are they?
红的是我的客人  蓝色的是你的012---Okay, the red ones are my guests, and the blue ones are yours.
真可怜  我只有10个客人012---This is so sad. I mean, I only have like 10 pins.
钱德  轻松一点  这又不是比赛012---Heh, Chandler, relax. It's not a contest.
不是实力相当的比赛012---Certainly not a close one.
大家好  嘿012---Hello. Hey.
嘿  瑞秋012---Hey, Rash.
别再想了012---Stop picturing it!
我想就这样吧  座位都确定了  这就是我们的婚礼012---Okay, I think that's it. The seating chart is done. This is our wedding.
他们看上去都很开心  对吧012---Wow. They all look like they're having fun  don't they?
我爸妈坐哪里012---Hey, so where are my parents gonna be?
看看啊  如果这是婚礼大厅012---Let's see, well, if this is the wedding hall, then, um...
你父母会在皇后区的家里012---...your parents would be over here at home in Queens.
什么  他们没有被邀请  哦不  这太可怕了  他们会发疯的012---What they're not invited? Oh, no, that's terrible! they're gonna be crushed!
为什么他们觉得会被邀请012---Why would they think they're invited?
你问倒我了  我不012---You got me. I don't...
乔伊   抱歉  我以为父母都会来012---Joey! Well, I'm sorry. Look, I thought parents were coming.
你的父母会来  钱德的父母也会来012---Y'know? Your parents are coming. Chandler's parents are coming.
罗斯的父母也会来012---Ross's parents are coming.
罗斯的父母就是我的父母012---Ross's parents are my parents.
看么  父母们都会来012---Well-well, see, parents are coming.
我想我们应该邀请他们  算了吧  你就想多增加几根蓝色大头针012---Y'know I think we should invite them. Oh please, you just want more blue pins.
这实在太悲惨了012---Well, this is just sad.
好吧  好吧  也许我重新安排一下位置可以让他们进来012---All right. all right. Maybe I can fit them in if I just do some rearranging.
不过  瑞秋可能真的要坐在吧台了012---But uh, Rachel may actually have to sit at the bar.
没有问题012---That is not a problem.
也许你可以叫杯桑格利亚调酒  去你的012---Maybe you'll order a little sangria. Oh, get out of here!
我们所有的晚礼服都在这儿  随便你喜欢哪一件  都可以便宜给你012---So now, these are all the tuxedos that we make and if there's anything that you like, we can make you a deal.
任选一件  但这三件是摩妮卡先核准的012---Anything at all. But these are the three that Monica pre-approved.
谢谢你帮我挑晚礼服  瑞秋012---Uh, well, thanks a lot for hooking me up Rach.
我希望你作为我的客人出席婚礼012---And I want you to know that I want you to attend our wedding as my guest.
我是摩妮卡的伴娘012---I'm Monica's maid of honor.
好吧  别想把我钉在你的蓝色大头针上012---Okay, don't try to blue-pin me.
那这些呢  怎么样  看起来不错  是不错啊012---Well, what's the deal with these? These-these look nice. Oh they are nice.
这些都是帮名人量身打造的  他们穿过后就送回来这儿012---We-we custom-make tuxedos for celebrities and then when they're done with them they just send 'em back.
你是指像颁奖典礼之后  有些是012---You mean, like, for award shows? Some of them.
这都上过红地毯  被人叫着012---You mean these tuxes have been down the red carpet with people yelling, uh...
"你是穿谁的  你看来棒极了"012---..."Who are you wearing? You look fabulous!"
亲爱的  我建议你  多看一点ESPN体育频道012---Honey, might I suggest watching a little more ESPN...
少看一点八卦娱乐节目012---...and a little less E!.
谁穿过这些012---Okay. Who wore those?
这是汤姆布罗考(NBC新闻主播)穿过的  不错嘛012---Umm, well, let's see uh, this one's Tom Brokaw. Not bad.
这是保罗奥尼尔(美财政部长)穿过的012---This one is, uh, Paul O'Neil.
他是谁012---Who's that?
他是"洋基队"的球员  真的  多看看ESPN012---He plays for the Yankees. Seriously, ESPN.
就算有的时候  开着频道当背景听也好啊012---Just once in a while. Have it on in the background.
这件是皮尔斯布鲁斯南穿过的012---Ooh, this one was Pierce Brosnan.

乔伊  我替罗斯和钱德挑选好了婚礼上用的晚礼服  你需要吗012---So Joey I just hooked Ross and Chandler up with some tuxedos for the wedding, Do you need one?
不  我主持婚礼  我不穿晚礼服012---No, I'm performing the ceremony. I'm not wearing a tux.
那你打算穿什么  五彩长袍012---Well, what are you gonna wear? Multi-colored robes.
也许戴一顶帽子012---Ooh, and maybe a hat.
摩妮卡知道吗  我想她不知道012---Huh. Does Monica know about this? I don't think so.
你告诉她时我能在场吗012---Can I please be there when you tell her?
瑞秋等等  今晚要不要去看电影012---Hey, Rach wait! you want to go to a movie tonight?
没办法  我去不了  我要和梅莉莎吃饭012---Oh, y'know what? I can't. I have to have dinner with that Melissa girl.
我能跟你去吗012---Can I come?
我不会出声  你只会听见我摄影机的声音012---I won't even talk! You'll just hear the noise from my video camera.
什么  怎么回事  让我来告诉她吗  能让我来告诉她吗012---What? What's going on? Oh good! Can I tell her? Can I tell her?!
你要听真实发生的事  还是听乔伊的下流版本012---Do you want to hear what actually happened or Joey's lewd version?
乔伊的  好012---Joey's. Okay.
喂  少来012---Okay, come on.
大学时我有一个朋友012---I had this friend from college...
我犯了一个愚蠢的错误  我告诉乔伊有一次012---...and I made the mistake of telling Joey that one time...
她和我接吻了012---...she and I, you know, kissed a little bit.
对啊  我相信这当然发生了012---Yeah, I'm sure that happened.
真的啊  当然012---It did. Sure.
嘿  那就真的发生了012---Hey, heh. It happened.
是大四那年  有一次开夏威夷主题派对舞会012---Yeah, it was senior year in college. It was after the Sigma Chi luau...
我和梅莉莎喝得大醉012---...and Melissa and I got very drunk.
结果我们两个接吻了  足足有好几分钟呢012---And we ended up kissing. For several minutes.
也就是在脸颊上轻轻地亲了一下012---Which means she had a couple spritzers and a peck on the cheek.
你为什么要剥夺我的幻想呢012---Why are you taking this away from me? Ugh.
为什么你就不相信呢012---Yeah, why is it so hard for you to believe?
好吧  我不知道你是同性恋012---Okay. I just I didn't know that you were a lesbian.
我不是说我是同性恋  我只是说那件事发生了012---I'm not saying that I'm a lesbian. I'm just saying that this happened.
我只是觉得很狂野  而你是这么地012---Okay, it just seems pretty wild. And you're-You know, so...
乖宝宝012---...vanilla.
乖宝宝  我不是乖宝宝  我会做很多疯狂的事012---Vanilla? I'm not vanilla. I've done lots of crazy things.
我还喝醉了  在拉斯维加斯还结了婚012---I mean, I got drunk and married in Vegas.
和罗斯012---To Ross.
这样吧  如果你还不相信012---All right, y'know what? If you don't want to believe me  about this...
今晚和我一起去吃饭  她会告诉你012---...why don't you just come with me to dinner tonight and she'll tell you.
好吧  反正我也想像不出来012---Okay. All right! Yeah! Because I can't picture it.
你该到我脑子里来看看012---Oh-ho, you should get inside my head.
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
猜猜我为你的婚礼弄到什么了012---Guess what I got for your wedding?
一个脑袋上有衣架的畸形女友012---A freakishly thin date with a hanger for a head?
不是  瑞秋帮我找一件晚礼服  可不是随随便便的一件012---No. Rachel hooked me up with a tux. But not just any tux.
是蝙蝠侠的晚礼服012---Batman's tux!
什么  没错012---What? That's right.
这件晚礼服是给瓦尔基尔默在电影中用的  让他穿在票房冠军电影里012---Made expressly for Val Kilmer, and worn by him in the hit film...
就是他演的那部蝙蝠侠012---...that Batman film he was in.
你不能穿那件  我穿了名人的晚礼服012---You can't wear that. I'm wearing the famous tux.
詹姆士庞德的晚礼服    那又怎样012---James Bond's tux. So?
那又怎样  如果你穿那件  会让我显得不那么特别012---So—If you wear that, you'll make mine less special.
你需要什么来让那天特别一点吗012---Well, you need something to to make this day special?
喂  你有了最特别的一样012---Hello! You have the most special thing of all.
你娶了你最爱的女人012---You are marrying the woman you love.
拜托  不要抢走我的锋头嘛  拜托拜托012---Please, don't take away my cool thing. Please?! Pretty please?
"拜托拜托"   这可不象007012---"Pretty please?" Not very, uh, 007.
这是我的婚礼  如果是你结婚  我不会做任何让你生气的事012---Look, it's my wedding day okay? If you were getting married, I'd never do anything to upset you.
我结婚的时候  你和我妹妹上床  那就很007012---When I got married you slept with my sister. That was pretty 007.
嘿  嘿  好  你来了012---Hey. Hey. Okay, good. You're here.
好  我想出办法来了012---All right, I figured it out.
我把这两桌的8个人  加上你父母012---I'm gonna take 2 tables of 8, I'm gonna add your parents...
变成3桌6个人012---...and I'm gonna turn them into 3 tables of 6. Okay?
我已经通知了办酒席的人  要多做两份  都弄好了012---And I called the caterer. I added two extra meals, We are good to go!
很好  不过他们不来了012---Yeah. They're not coming.
什么012---What?
不知道为什么  他们觉得你是因为我才邀请他们的012---Somehow they got the idea that you only invited them because of me.
他们有点觉得自己是多余的012---They...feel a little unwanted.
真糟糕  确实那样的  不过还是很糟糕012---Oh that's too bad. It's true. But too bad.
要不这样摩妮卡  你可以打电话给我妈  乔伊012---Look Mon, if you could just call my mom. Oh, Joey.
拜托  让她知道是你真心希望他们去012---Come on. Look just-just tell—let her know that you really want them there.
别忘了  这可是每年都给你送很多很多千层面的女人啊012---Let's not forget this is a woman who that has sent you many lasagnas over the years.
不  她哪有012---No, she hasn't.
有些没送到你手里也不是她的错啊012---Is it her fault that some of them didn't make it to you?
那我该怎么说呢012---Well, what am I gonna say?
告诉她请帖搞乱了  不  怪邮局好了012---Just uh, Just tell them you mixed up invitations. No, no, no, blame it on the post office.
他们最恨邮局  还有爱尔兰人012---They hate the post office. And the Irish.
不过我想你不能怪到他们头上012---But I don't think you could blame it on them.
喂  你好  崔比亚尼太太吗  我是摩妮卡盖勒012---Hello? Yeah, hi. Uh, Mrs. Tribbiani? Hi, this is Monica Geller.
我想告诉你  钱德跟我希望你们能来参加婚礼012---I'm just calling to say that Chandler and I uh, really hope you can make the wedding.
我们很多请帖都没寄到012---Yeah, apparently a bunch of invitations that we sent weren't delivered.
我猜又是可恶的邮局搞砸的012---Um, I guess there was some screw-up at the damn post office.
就是嘛012---Tell me about it.
什么美国邮局  更像是美国遗失局012---Yeah, yeah, the U.S. Post Office? No. More like U.S. Lost Office.
难道他们都是爱尔兰人吗012---What are they, Irish?
总之呢  他叫艾伦  我们在一起三年了012---Anyway, his name's Allen. And we've been going out for three years.
他是我做宴会规划的第一位客户012---He was my first client when I became a party planner.
那时他正要为他当时的女朋友  规划一场宴会012---He was actually planning a party for his girlfriend at the time.
结果就变成这样012---Oh, well. No.
他是雪城大学兄弟会的  哦  太棒了012---Ah. He was Theta Beta Pi at Syracuse. Oh! Oh, that's great.
菲比  你参加过女生联谊会吗  当然012---Phoebe, were you ever in a sorority? Of course.
我是大腿卫生棉条的成员012---Yes. I was a, um, Thigh Mega Tampon.
什么012---What one?
我们规模也很大  但后来他们把我们解散了012---Yeah, Y'know, we were really huge too. But then they had to shut us down...
因为瑞吉娜佛兰姬基死于酒精中毒012---...when Regina Phalangie died of alcohol poisoning.
真是糟糕   一颗老鼠屎就毁了一锅粥012---Oh, isn't it a shame when one girl ruins it for the whole bunch?
不管了012---Anyway...
醉话说的太多了   我告诉菲比012---Speaking of drinking too much, I was, uh, telling Phoebe...
姐妹会开夏威夷派对  很疯的那晚  我们亲吻的事012---...about that one crazy night after the Sigma Chi luau where you and I uh, we made out.
什么012---What?
记得嘛  我们穿着土著裙子  还有椰子壳比基尼上衣012---Remember we-Come on, we had sarongs on and we had coconut bikini tops.
之后我们回到家  继续在那儿疯癫012---We went back to the house and got really silly...
然后我们接吻了012---...and we made out.
瑞瑞  我不知道你在说什么012---Wow, Ray-Ray, I have no idea what you're talking about.
真的吗012---Really?
罗斯是蝙蝠侠012---Ross is Batman.
他还真会掩护秘密身分  瞒了这么久012---Well, he did manage to keep his identity secret for a long time.
瑞秋替罗斯弄到  瓦尔基尔默在蝙蝠侠里穿的晚礼服012---Rachel got Ross the tuxedo that Val Kilmer wore in Batman.
蝙蝠侠可比詹姆士庞德酷多了012---Batman is so much cooler than James Bond.
你在说什么啊  007有好多新式武器   蝙蝠侠有多功能腰带012---What are you talking about?!  007 has all those gadgets. Batman has a utility belt.
007有特制的汽车   蝙蝠侠有蝙蝠车012---007 has a fancy car. Batman has the Batmobile.
007有美女相伴  蝙蝠侠只有罗宾012---007 gets all the ladies. Heh. Batman has Robin.
我们有ESPN台  对吧012---We get ESPN, right?
不如你去穿上007晚礼服   我来给你调一杯马丁尼酒012---How about you go put on your 007 tuxedo, and I'll make you a nice martini?
我不喜欢  马丁尼012---Actually I don't like martinis.
那有搞笑吸管的摇摇饮料呢  好的012---A Yoo-Hoo with a funny straw? Ooh, yum.
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
请帖上写晚上6点012---Listen, I know the invitation says 6:00...
那是指6点入席  还是6点开始表演012---...but does that mean that you want people to get there at 6, or the show is gonna start right at 6?
表演012---The show?
对  婚礼  知道了012---Right, Right. the wedding. Gotcha.
不过婚礼能不能晚一点开始  我是说  婚礼晚一点进行  行吗012---But I mean, it's gonna start a little late right? I mean, weddings start late. Right?
你有参加过我规划的婚礼吗012---Have you ever been to one of my weddings?
你看  事情是这样的  那天也是我外甥女的洗礼日012---Ah, Well look, the thing is it's the same day as my niece's christening...
我真的希望我父母能准时出席来看我012---...and I really want my parents to be there in time to see me.
因为我的角色是在开始部分  演出的其他部分没我什么事012---'Cause My part's just in the beginning. I'm not even in the rest of the show-Wedding.
婚礼6点开始012---The wedding starts at 6.
好  好  我完全明白了012---Okay. Okay, I totally hear you.
这样如何  我可以表演个小节目到他们来012---Ooh! How about this? I vamp a little till they get there.
你要 "表演"012---Heh. You'll "vamp"?
对啊  就像给观众热热身  问问他们从哪儿来012---Yeah, yeah, y'know, like warm up the crowd. Ask 'em where they're from.
因为有乔伊崔比亚尼在  就像同时拥有了一个牧师和一个演员012---'Cause In Joey Tribbiani, you get a minister and you get an entertainer.
我是一位 "表演牧师"012---I'm a "mini-stainer."
不会比这更好的了  不会比这更棒的012---There's no one better. There's no one greater.
你怎么会不记得我们接吻的事012---How can you not remember us kissing?
不知道  很多从没发生过的事我不记得了012---I don't know. I don't remember a lot of things that never happened.
什么012---Wha--
拜托  记得我们在卧室外的走廊  一直笑一直笑吗012---Come on! Remember, we were on the sleeping porch? We couldn't stop giggling.
我们戴的椰子壳都撞在一起了012---And our coconuts kept knocking together.
哦  乔伊的脑袋该爆炸了012---Oh, somewhere Joey's head is exploding.
对吧  听着  抱歉  我不是想让你难堪012---Yeah—but come on—Listen, I'm sorry I don't want to make you uncomfortable...
但我告诉菲比那件事  她不相信我012---...but I told Phoebe it happened, and she doesn't believe me.
对不起  瑞瑞  如果我认为真有那回事  我会承认的012---I'm sorry. Ray-ray. I mean, if I thought it happened, I would say it.
也许我醉睡过去后  你亲了我012---Maybe I passed out and you did stuff to me while I was sleeping.
没有012---No.
瑞秋  没关系的  不必这样  我相信你012---Rachel, It's okay, you don't have to do this. I believe you.
如果你说你吻过梅莉莎  你就是吻过梅莉莎012---Okay, if-if you say you kissed Melissa, then you kissed Melissa.
谢谢你  菲比  好012---Thank you, Phoebe. Okay.
可是她没有  我知道012---But she didn't. I know.
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
你到哪儿都带着它012---You just carry that around?
是的012---Yes.
我发现这可以成为我炫耀的资本012---I find it to be something of a conversation piece.
你和  阿甘012---Between you and...? Gunther.
我们为什么不一起穿上呢012---Hey, hey. Why don't we put them on?
拍一张蝙蝠侠和詹姆士庞德一起的照片012---Y'know get a picture of Batman and James Bond, together.
我很乐意  但是我的不合身  裤子小了一点012---I would but mine doesn't fit. The pants a little tight.
小了一点  我可以看到里面的两个0和一个7012---A little tight? I could see double-oh and seven in those pants.
真糟糕  我还很期待  穿着我们的名人晚礼服一起亮相012---Well that stinks. I was looking forward to us wearing our celebrity tuxes together.
你意思是你不打算穿你的了  你开玩笑吗  这可是蝙蝠侠的晚礼服012---Well, does that mean that you're not gonna be wearing yours? What are you kidding? It's Batman's tux!
我穿上试试012---Let me try it on.
好吧  不过只能试穿上衣  两个O和一个7就不要穿进去了012---Okay. But just the jacket. double-oh and seven are not getting in there.
好的012---0Kay.
双面通风的舒适型   蝙蝠侠012---Holy double-vented comfort, Batman!

他穿这个  演瞎子的那部文艺爱情片首映012---He wore it to the premiere of some tooty-fruity lovestory where he was a blind guy.
让我看看012---Let me see that.
老天012---Oh, man.
你唯一的超能力  就是嗅觉发达012---The only super power you have is the slightly heightened sense of smell.
摩妮卡  钱德  可以和你们谈谈吗012---Hey. Uh, Monica? Chandler? can I talk to you guys for a second?
算了  我放弃了  你想怎样就怎样吧012---All right that's it, I give up. Whatever you want, you can have it.
你要唱歌还是跳舞012---You want to sing a song? You wanna do a dance?
你想让你妈妈站在圣坛前大喊种族危机  我都不在乎012---You want your mom stand at the altar screaming racial slurs? I don't care.

能参与你们最特别的一天012---They're so happy to get to be a part of your special day.
不客气  告诉他们  我们很高兴他们会来012---Well, your welcome. And tell them we're really glad they're coming.

那是真的  我告诉你那发生过  好的012---It happened. I am telling you it happened. Okay.
很高兴认识你012---Hey, Well, it was great meeting you.
还有  瑞秋  我想我不会给你打电话了  因为012---And, uh, Rachel? I don't think I'll be calling you because, uh...
你变得好奇怪012---...you know, you've gotten weird.
保重  两位012---Take care, you guys.
什么  等等  等一下  好  听着012---Wha-Wait a minute. No wait a minute! Okay, look.
那天晚上的事是  我这辈子里干的最疯狂的一件事012---That night was the one wild thing I've ever done in my entire life.
我不会让你这样轻易就否认012---and I'm not gonna let you take that away from me.
如果你不记得那件事  也许你会记得这个012---Okay, so if you don't remember that, maybe you'll remember this...
我的天  你爱我012---Oh, my God. You love me.
什么  我当然记得我们的吻012---What? Of course I remember our kiss.
我每时每刻都在想着012---I think about it all the time.
我还能听到  椰子壳碰在一起的声音012---I can still hear the coconuts knocking together, I...
我不想告诉你  因为我不觉得  你会回报我的爱  现在你回报012---I just didn't want to tell you, because I didn't think that you'd return my love. and now that you have...
喔  喔  喔012---Whoa, whoa, whoa.
你看谁突然害羞起来了012---Aw! Look who's being suddenly shy.
你一定和我有一样的感觉012---You can't tell me you don't feel what I feel.
一定是要发自于内心  才能吻得那么好012---Nobody can kiss that good and not mean it.
我只是吻功很好012---I-I-I-I'm just…I'm just a good kisser!
别说了012---Shut up.

我在开玩笑012---I'm obviously kidding.
我没爱上你  我也没爱上她012---I'm not in love with you. I'm not in love with her.
我没听到椰子壳撞在一起的声音012---I don't hear coconuts banging together.
我和男友做爱时没幻想你的脸012---Yeah, I don't picture your face when I make love to my boyfriend.
我要走了012---Anyway, I gotta go.
吻别一下吧012---A kiss goodbye?
不要  好吧012---No? Okay.
我没想到会是这样012---I mean, I had no idea that that was gonna...
这是怎么回事012---What the hell was that?
我只是想看看这有什么大不了的012---I just wanted to see what all the fuss was about.
然后呢  我尝试过更好的012---And? I've had better.

还有这么多事要做  你写好你的婚礼誓词了吗012---There's still so much to do! Have you written your vows yet?
我想我会去买 "派特  我要买婚礼誓词"012---I figured I'd just buy those. "Pat, I'd like to buy a vow." Ha, ha.

现在写  没有那么困难012---Let's just do it right now. Okay? It won't be hard.
说你心里想的012---Just say what's in your heart.

现在他们知道你知道  但他们不知道瑞秋知道012---Okay, so now they know that you know and they don't know that Rachel knows?
对  但你知道吗  谁知道什么并不重要012---Yes, but y'know what? it doesn't matter who knows what.
现在有足够的人知道  就可以告诉他们我们知道了012---Now, enough of us know that we can just tell them that we know.
谎言  秘密终于可以结束了012---Then all the lying and the secrets would finally be over!
或者我们不要告诉他们我们知道  我们就可以找点小乐子012---Or, we can not tell them we know and have a little fun of our own.
好  如果想赶上电影的话  我们该走了012---All right honey, We better go if we're gonna catch that movie.
再见  再见012---Bye. Bye.
再见  钱德  我已经开始想你了012---Bye, Chandler. I miss you already.
你看到了吗  她的那些勾引了吗012---Okay, did you see that?! With the inappropriate pinching?
我看到了012---Actually, I did.
现在你相信她被我吸引了吧012---So now do you believe that she's attracted to me?
我的天  我的天  她知道我们的事012---Oh, my God! My God, she knows about us!
菲比知道我们的事  我没有告诉她们012---Phoebe knows about us! Well I didn't tell them.
她们  她们是谁012---Them? Who's them?
菲比和乔伊012---Uh, Phoebe and Joey.
乔伊012---Joey!
还有瑞秋012---And Rachel.
我本来要告诉你们的  可是她们要我保证不说012---I would've told you but they made me promise not to tell.
她们以为她们很厉害  这样耍我们012---Oh man, they think they are so slick, messing with us!
可是  她们不知道  我们知道她们知道012---But see they don't know that we know that they know.
所以  对012---So... Ah, yes!
耍人的要变成被耍的了012---Ahh yes, the messers become the mes-sees!
我的天  他要我过去  摸他的二头肌还有别的啥的012---My God, he wants me to come over and feel his biceps and more!
你开玩笑吧  没有012---Are you kidding? No.
我不相信  他会对摩妮卡这样012---I can't believe he'd do that to Mo--
乔伊  他们知道我们知道了吗012---Joey? Do they know that we know?
不知道  乔伊012---No. Joey!
他们知道你们知道  我就知道012---They know you know. Ugh! I knew it!
不能相信这两个人012---Oh I cannot believe those two!
他们以为可以耍我们  他们想要耍我们012---God, they thought that they could mess with us? They're trying to mess with us?!
他们不知道我们知道  他们知道我们知道012---They don't know that we know they know we know.
乔伊  你什么也不能说012---Joey, you can't say anything.
就算我想说  也不知道要怎么说012---I couldn't even if I wanted too.
这完全失控了012---Listen, this is totally getting out of hand.
她要我替她抹乳液  她在唬你012---Okay? She wants me to put lotion on her! She's bluffing!
她没有退缩  她还这样012---Look, she's not backing down. She went like this.
他没有退缩  他去拿乳液了012---He's not backing down. He went to get lotion.
天啊  你们还没玩完吗012---Oh, man. Aren't you guys done yet?
乔伊  菲比早点搞定钱德  这事就会早一点公开  早点结束012---Joey look, just look at it this way, the sooner Phoebe breaks Chandler the sooner this is all over and out in the open.
我喜欢  好012---Ooh, I like that. Okay.
对了  给他看你的胸罩  他最怕胸罩了  他不会解胸罩012---Okay, show him your bra. He's afraid of bras. Can't work them.
哇  你是怎么没扯掉任何扣子012---Wow! You didn't rip off any buttons.
也不是第一次了012---It's not my first time.
去到外面  继续勾引她  直到她崩溃为止012---You go back out there and you seduce her until she cracks.
好  给我一秒钟012---Okay, give me a second.
你在打扫这里  当然012---Did you clean up in here? Of course.
你要走了012---Oh, you're, uh, going?
除非你一起来  爱人012---Um, not without you, lover.
这是我的胸罩012---So, this is my bra.
非常非常的好看012---It's very, very nice.
过来012---Well, come here.
我非常开心  我们可以一起做爱012---I'm very happy we're gonna have all the sex.
你会的  我身体很柔软的012---You should be. Heh. I'm very bendy.
我现在要吻你了  如果我没先吻你的话012---I'm gonna kiss you now. Not if I kiss you first.
我想我们除了接吻  没有别的事可做了012---Well, I guess there's nothing left for us to do but-but kiss.
来了012---Here it comes.
我们的初吻012---Our first kiss.
好  好  好  你赢了 哈012---Okay, okay, okay, fine, you win! You win!! Ha!
我不能和你上床  为什么不能012---I can't have sex  with ya! And why not?!
因为我爱摩妮卡  你什么012---Because I'm in love with Monica!! You're what?
爱她  对  我爱她  我爱她012---Love her! That's right, I love her! I love her!
我爱你  摩妮卡012---I love you, Monica.
我也爱你  钱德012---I love you too, Chandler.
我以为你们两个只是上床  我不知道你们恋爱了012---I thought you guys were doing it, I didn't know you were in love.
就是这样  结束了  大家都知道了012---That's it, it's over. Everybody knows.
其实  罗斯还不知道  请大家还不要告诉他012---Well actually, Ross doesn't. Yes, and we'd appreciate it if no one told him yet.
不  不012---No. No! Wh
你在干什么012---What are you doing?
放开我妹012---Get off my sister!
朋友要结婚了  很多事会改变的012---Y'know, you're friends getting married, it's gotta change things.
你觉得真的会不一样吗012---You really think it'll be that different?
怎么能不变呢  他们很快就会有小孩012---How can it not be? I mean pretty soon they're gonna have kids...
会和其他有孩子的夫妇在一起012---...and then they're just gonna be hanging out with other couples who have kids.
也许他们会搬离城市012---And then maybe they're gonna have to leave the city...
到某个靠近富豪车商的地方012---...to be near a Volvo dealership.
事情会变的012---Well, things change.
我不要他们搬到  卖富豪车的地方012---I don't want them to move to a Volvo dealership.
乔伊  不会怎么样的012---It'll be okay, Joe. Heh.
抱歉  我只是  我希望能像以前一样012---Sorry. I just-I like things the way they are.
这个光着身子的小孩是谁012---Who's this little naked guy?

你们真好012---Oh that's so sweet. Hmm.
我们都写完婚礼誓词了  我们可以看吗012---So, we both finished our vows. Can we read them?
当然可以  只要我没听到钱德的  他没听到我的就好012---Yeah, I don't hear Chandler's and he doesn't hear mine.
好  好012---Okay. Okay.
噢  那段写的太美了012---Oh, that's beautiful.
很搞笑呀   不错012---Funny one! That's good!
摩妮卡  你嫁给我好吗012---Monica,  will-will you marry me?
什么  我不懂012---Ha-ha-ha. What? I don't get it.
是哟012---Oh, yeah!
这太搞笑了  钱德012---Oh man, this is hilarious! Chandler!
甜心  别担心  我们会让你的更搞笑的012---Don't worry, we'll make yours funnier.
好了  你们觉得如何012---Okay, what do you guys think?
老兄  我从没见过这样的爱012---Dude... I have never known love like this.
你真的喜欢  老兄012---You really like it? Dude!
你怎么写出来的012---How did you write this?
我偷了摩妮卡的  然后改掉名字012---I stole Monica's and changed the name. Shh.
你不能这么做  如果他先讲的话就可以012---You can't do that! If he goes first he can!
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
摩妮卡  我看到保时捷停在前门口012---Hey uh Mon, I saw the Porsche parked out front.
钥匙能借我一下吗  我想带那个坏男孩出去兜几圈012---Can I get the keys? Thought I'll take that bad boy out for a little spin.
等等  罗斯可以开  我问你时  你说只有你能开012---Wait a minute! You let Ross drive the Porsche and when I ask you, you say you're the only one who's allowed to drive it.
他是我哥哥啊  而且他开的很慢   不会出事的012---Yeah, well he's my brother, And plus he drives so slow he couldn't never hurt it.
那是辆车  摩妮卡  不是火箭012---It's a car, Monica, not a rocket ship.
随便啦  罗斯012---Whatever, Ross.
兜完风后  帮我换一下煞车灯的灯泡012---Just replace the bulbs in the brake lights after you're done.
嘿  嗨012---Hey. Hi.
我看到保时捷了  真的很酷  我什么时候能再开出去兜风啊012---Saw the Porsche  out there Mon, Looking good. When do I get to take that baby out again?
你让乔伊开保时捷  我从来没开过  一次都没有012---You let Joey drive it? I've never driven it. Okay? Not once.
好吧  只有一次  好吧  我常常开012---Okay, once. Okay, I drive it all the time.
感谢大家  "你可以开  但别告诉瑞秋" 计划宣告失败012---Nice work everybody! So much for the y'know, "you can drive it but don't tell Rachel" plan.
哇  真不敢相信你们骗我012---Wow, I can't believe you lied to me.
这事交给我来吧  摩妮卡  瑞秋认为你脑子里只想着婚礼012---Okay, I can fix this. Okay Monica, Rachel thinks all you can talk about is the wedding.
瑞秋  我不让你开保时捷  是因为你是个糟糕的司机012---Great! Well Rachel, the reason why I won't let you drive the Porsche is because you're a terrible driver.
怎么样   跟婚礼无关吧012---There. That wasn't about the wedding.
瑞秋  如果你想坐保时捷去兜风  我可以带你在附近转转012---Look Rach if-if you want to go for a ride in the Porsche, I’ll be glad to take you for a quick spin around the block.
你有几个小时吗012---Yeah, you got a couple hours?
老友记  第七季  第22集  钱德之父012---Friends  S07E22  The One With Chandler's Dad
喔  兜风真痛快啊012---Whew, that was a brisk ride.
你敞开了篷跑  对不对  这样才能感觉在飞012---Take the top down, did you? Only way to fly.
罗斯把钥匙给我  摩妮卡错了  我是个很棒的司机012---Come on Ross give me the keys. Monica does not know what she's talking about! I'm an excellent driver.
你开的又快又不可靠  结论就是一个差司机012---You're fast and irresponsible. That adds up to a bad driver.
高中时  我那些特点让我当上了啦啦队长012---Well in high school, that added up to head cheerleader.
你有没有看到那个女孩在注视着我012---Did you see the look that girl just gave me, huh?
她一定看到了我开保时捷兜风的帅样012---She must've seen me cruising in the bad boy.
我想她在看你的一头乱鸡窝  什么012---I think she's checking out your beehive Ross. What?
梳子给我  钥匙给我012---Give me a brush. Give me the keys.
不行  那就不给梳子012---No way! Well, no brush.
好吧  没关系012---Fine. Y'know what? It doesn't matter.
如果我没记错  洗手间地上有一把梳子012---because, if I remember correctly, there's a comb on the floor of the bathroom.
离婚赡养费012---Alimony.
钱德  你爸还没寄回函给我们012---Chandler, we still haven't gotten an RSVP from your dad.
喔  对啊  也许是因为我没有寄给他邀请信012---Oh, right. Urn, maybe that's because I didn't send him an invitation.
钱德  他是你父亲呀  他应该出席我们的婚礼012---Chandler, he's your father. He should be at your wedding.
我甚至不认得他  我们不亲  我好几年没跟他见过面了012---I don't even know the man. Okay? We're not the close.I haven't seen him in years.
如果他知道我们没有邀请他呢012---Well what are you gonna do when he finds out he wasn't even asked?
他又不会知道  我们的生活圈不一样012---Well he doesn't have to know! It's not like we run in the same circles.
我跟你们混在一起  而他012---I hang out with you guys and he...
他在拉斯维加斯表演变装秀012---...stars in a drag show in Vegas.
我想和他交换生活圈012---Ooh, I think I want to trade circles.
相信我  你不会想邀请他来  没有人会看新娘012---Trust me, you don't want him there either. Okay? Nobody is gonna be stare at the bride...
因为新郎的爸爸穿着露背洋装012---...when the groom's father's wearing a back-less dress.
那又怎么样012---Heh, so what?
只要他不穿婚纱  我根本不在乎012---As long as he's not wearing a white dress and a veil, I don't care.
我想我得去买点东西012---Okay, I think I need to do some shopping.
太棒了012---Ooh, nice.
我的天啊012---My God!
你以为你在做什么  我只是在清洗挡风玻璃012---What do you think you're doing? Just washing the windshield.
我绝不会让你开这辆车012---There's no way I am letting you drive this car.
把钥匙还给我吧012---So why don't you just hand over the keys?
不  不要启动车子012---No ah-ah-ah! Do not start this car.
好吧  我给你二十块012---Okay, okay. I will give you 2O bucks...
只要你立刻下车012---...if you get out of this car right now.
听着012---Look.
罗斯  如果你真的那么害怕  就上车吧012---Ross, If you're so freaked out, just get in the car.
跟你一起去兜风  是噢012---With you? Yeah, right.
好吧012---All right.
好吧  好吧  好吧012---Okay, okay, okay.
你在干什么  坐到前面来  要我坐死亡座椅012---What are you doing? Get in front. In the death seat?

拿去吧012---Here.
这是什么  你的行李  我们要去拉斯维加斯012---What's this? It's your suitcase. We're going to Las Vegas.
真的吗  要私奔吗  不必再筹备那个该死的婚礼012---Are you serious? I mean like eloping?! No more stupid wedding stuff.
不必再烦恼这些花或那些花  想想这样我们能省多少钱012---No more these flowers, or these flowers or these flowers— Think of the money we'll save.
我们不是私奔  我喜欢花  我们的婚礼能再盛大一点吗  拜托012---We're not eloping. I love the flowers. Can our wedding be bigger, please?
我们要去拉斯维加斯找你爸012---We're going to Las Vegas to see your dad.
你们该聚一聚了  我也想认识我公公012---It's time you two talked, and I want to get to know my father-in-law.
我们已经谈过这事了  我赢了012---Y'know we already went over this and I won.
不  你没赢  甜心  你应该知道012---No, you didn't. Oh and honey, just so you know...
现在是你要娶我  你就赢不了的012---Now that you're marrying me, you don't get to win anymore.
还是算了吧  我不想去  我不想见到他  我不想012---Look forget it okay? I don't want to go. I don't want to see him. I don't wanna.
钱德  我知道你爸让你觉得丢脸012---Chandler, look I-I know that your dad embarrassed you. I know...
不  不  所有的小孩  都会觉得自己的父母很丢脸012---No-no all kids are embarrassed by their parents.
你应该多知道一些我的经历012---you'd have to come up with a whole new word for what I went through.
高中的时候  他参加了我所有的游泳比赛012---When I was in high school, he used to come to all my swim meets...
每次都装扮成不同的好莱坞明星012---...dressed as a different Hollywood starlet.
对于我14的人来说是很痛苦的012---It's hard enough to be 14.
瘦巴巴的  连紧身泳裤都太大  你妈妈保证说有一天你会长大成熟012---You're skinny, You're wearing Speedos--That your morn promised you'd grow into.
你要是往好的方面看  那是你爸爸给你加油012---You look up in the stands. There's your dad cheering you on.
他打扮成卡门米兰达  戴着有真水果的头巾作装饰012---Dressed as Carmen Miranda, wearing a headdress with real fruit...
之后他会把那些水果  做为健康零食  发给你的朋友012---...that he'll later hand out to your friends as a healthy snack.
重点是他参加了  你每一场游泳比赛  帮你加油012---Hey, the point is that he was at every one of your swim meets and he was there cheering you on.
这说明  他是个好爸爸012---Okay? That's a, that's a pretty great dad.
他还跟嘉利巴迪老师上床012---He had sex with Mr. Garibaldi.
嘉利巴迪是谁  那很重要吗012---Who's Mr. Garibaldi? Does it matter?
钱德012---Chandler...
你不再是14岁的孩子  好吗  那些事或许你该放下了012---You're not 14 anymore, okay? Maybe it's time you let that stuff go.
如果你的父亲没来参加婚礼  你会抱憾终生的012---If your father's not at your wedding, you're gonna regret it for the rest of your life.
好吧  但我这么做是为了你012---Okay, but I'm just doing this for you.
太好了012---Yes!
我永远都赢不了吗  你以前又赢过几次012---So I really never get to win anymore? How much did ever really win before?
菲比  嘿012---Pheebs. Hey.
你知道当你穿着裤子  身体向前倾时012---Listen, you know how, uh, when you're wearing pants and you lean forward...
我偷看你的内裤吗012---...I check out your underwear?
知道啊012---Yeah.
嗯  当杰克身体往前倾时012---Well, when Jake did it... Mm-hm.
我看到他穿着女人的内裤012---...I saw that he was wearing women's underwear.
我知道  那是我的012---I know. They were mine.
不  不  等一下  那太奇怪了012---No, no, wait. That's weird.
不会啊  我们只是闹着玩  我跟他打赌他不敢穿012---No, it’s not! We were just goofing around, and I dared him to try them on.
那真的很奇怪012---That's weird!
我正穿着他的内裤  那还蛮性感的012---I'm wearing his briefs right now. That's kind of hot.
我也那么想  你知道那个小洞吗  刚好拿来放我的口红012---I think so too. And that little flap? Great for holding my lipstick.
我倒是不知道那一点012---Yeah, I wouldn't know about that.
杰克说  其实女人的内裤更舒服012---And! Y'know what Jake says? That women's underwear is actually more comfortable.
他喜欢丝质内裤  贴在皮肤上的感觉012---And he loves the way the silk feels against his skin.
接下来他会说  穿上你的高跟鞋  他更婀娜多姿012---Yeah well next thing you know, he'll be telling you that your high heels are good for his posture.
杰克没有什么不正常的  他很有男人味012---There's nothing wrong with Jake. He is all man.
我认为他比你更有男人味012---I'm thinking even more than you.
没错  他就好像穿着粉色蕾丝装的伐木工人012---Oh yeah, he looked like a real lumberjack in those pink laoies.
我是说  只有对自己的男子汉气概有信心的人012---I'm just saying that only a man completely secure with his masculinity...
才敢穿着女人的内裤到处走  我敢说你办不到012---...could walk around in women's underwear. I don't think you could ever do that.
我很相信我的男子气概  好吧  随你说吧012---Hey! I am secure with my masculinity. Okay, whatever.
你都看过我收藏的色情杂志吧012---You've seen my huge stack of porn right?
天啊  我都忘了我有多爱开车了012---God, I forgot how much I love driving.
我得去换新驾照了012---I have got to get my license renewed.
你的驾照过期了  马上停车012---You don't have a valid driver's license? Okay that is it! Pull over right now.
罗斯  你太紧张了  尽管放轻松012---Oh Ross you're so tense. You just gotta relax,
好吗  你只需要放轻松  好吗  放轻松012---Okay? Just need to relax. All right? Just need to relax.
你干什么  一点都不好笑  别闹了012---What-what are you doing?! Are you—Okay that's not funny. Just stop horsing around.
我没有胡闹  好吗012---I am not horsing around, okay?
我在 "开保时捷" 兜风012---I am "Porsche-ing" around.
保持冷静  不会有事的  你没有惹上大麻烦012---Okay, stay calm. Nothing is going to happen to you, You're not in that much trouble.
真的吗  你那么认为012---Really? You think so?

你看起来好眼熟  我认识你吗012---y'know, You look familiar. Do I know you from somewhere?
应该不认识012---I don't think so.

我在《我们的日子》里演出  哇  真的吗012---I'm an actor on Days of our Lives. Wow. Really?

他有提到  戴哪种款式的吗012---Did he say what kind of neckline he's wearing?
没有012---No.

对不起  不过012---I'm sorry, but...
没事  什么012---Nothing. What?
老实说  自从我们订婚后012---Well, honestly? Ever since we got engaged...

真的吗  我也是012---Honestly? Me too.

你说了什么  嗯012---What is that? Well, I...
我告诉他如果他胆敢伤害你012---I told him that if he ever hurt you...
我会把他摁倒在地   然后痛扁他012---...I would hunt him down and kick his ass.
怎么  怎么  大家是怎么了  我是认真的012---What?! What?! What is the matter with everybody? I'm serious.

谢谢你记得穿  衣服来012---Thanks for wearing...something.
我真的很兴奋  我以为是我们害得你不敢结婚012---Oh honey! This is so exciting! I thought we screwed you up so bad this day would never come.
你想想  很快地  你就会有一大堆姓宾氏的小孩012---Oh and just think, soon there will be lots of little Bings.
我不敢相信我要回去  让人家继续喷口水012---I can't believe I have to go back to work after this and get spit on again.
你很幸运   至少喷你口水的人都很有名012---You're lucky. At least the people who spit on you are famous.
谁对你喷口水  我不想谈工作的事012---Who spits on you? I don't wanna talk about work.
宾太太  他们是我爸妈  茱蒂跟杰克盖勒012---Mrs. Bing? Here, These are my parents umm, Judy and Jack Geller.
很高兴能见到你  你是他妈妈还是他爸爸012---It's lovely to meet you. So are you his mother or his father?
杰克012---Jack!
干嘛   之前他父母我都没见过啊012---What? I've never seen one before.
爸  罗斯在那边  去跟他谈一谈吧012---Dad, there's Ross. why don't you go talk to him.

虽然有些人是衣不蔽体穿的少了点012---Although I think we may be seeing a little too much of some people.
你不觉得自己稍微老了点   不适合穿成这样嘛012---Aren't you a little old to be wearing a dress like that?
你不觉得自己是不是多了些东西   也不该穿成这样呢012---Don't you have a little too much penis to be wearing a dress like that?
喔  我的天啊012---Oh, my God.
你当然可以痛扁他  儿子012---Of course you can kick his ass, son.
你想痛扁任何人都没有问题012---You could kick anyone's ass you want to.
谢谢你们012---Thanks, you guys.
瑞秋  干嘛012---Rach, Rash? Yeah?
帮个忙  去跟钱德的老爸聊聊天  别让他跟钱德的老妈杠上了012---Umm hey, could you do me a favor. and would talk to Chandler's dad and try to keep him away from Chandler's morn.

我是伴郎012---Uh, and I'm the best man.
这段婚姻对我来说有双重特殊意义012---And this marriage is doubly special for me...
不仅仅因为新郎是我最好的朋友012---...um, because not only is the groom my best friend...
更因为新娘是我的妹妹012---...but, uh, the bride is my little sister.
她是所有男人  梦寐以求的好妹妹012---She's the greatest sister a guy could ask for.
各位请跟我一起举起杯012---So if you'd all please join me in raising a glass...
敬这对新人012---...to the couple we're here to celebrate.
敬宾氏夫妇   敬宾氏夫妇012---To the Bings. To the Bings!
好了  我要去熨婚纱了012---All right, I'm gonna go steam my wedding dress okay?
谁负责确定它不会有问题012---Who wants the responsibility of making sure nothing happens to it?
我会负责  谁要负责  有人愿意吗012---I'll do it. Who wants it? Anybody?
我说了我会负责  没有人愿意吗012---I said I'll do it. Nobody wants to do it?
好吧  那我就自己来  摩尼卡  我不会搞砸的012---All right, I'll do it myself. Monica! I'm not gonna screw it up.
你说得对  对不起  今晚你帮了大忙012---Y'know what? You're right. I'm sorry. Actually you were a big help tonight.
谢谢你帮忙  将我奶奶安全地送回饭店012---Yeah, and thanks for putting my grandmother in the cab and making sure she got to the hotel safely.
当然  那就是我的工作  好吧  对不起012---Well of course! That's what I'm here for. Okay. Sorry.
什么奶奶012---What grandmother?
你跑到哪里去了  我送我爸妈回饭店012---Hey! Where have you been? Oh, taking my parents back to the hotel.
你要回去工作了  对012---What? Are you going back to work? Yeah.
很酷的太阳眼镜  谢谢夸奖  我想如果我能戴上它拍戏012---Nice shades. Thanks. Yeah, I figure if I wear these in my scenes...
我的眼睛就不会喷到口水了012---...at least I won't get spit in the eyes, y'know?
如果我没有记错  雷朋眼镜是一次大战的正式赞助商012---And, if I remember correctly, Ray-Ban was the official sponsor of WWI.
那太棒了012---Great!
晚点见  好吧012---I'll see you later. All right.
钱德在哪里  我想他在瑞秋房间里  再见012---Hey, where's Chandler? I think he's in Rachel's room. See you.
钱德012---Chandler?
钱德012---Chandler?
嘿  嗨012---Hey. Hi.
摩妮卡在吗  她在熨婚纱  怎么了012---Is Monica here? She's steaming her dress. Why? What's up?
我想钱德走了  什么012---I think Chandler's gone. What?
他留下了这个  "告诉摩妮卡我很抱歉"012---He left that. "Tell Monica I'm sorry."
喔  我的天啊012---Oh, my God.
怎么了012---What's up?
"告诉摩妮卡我很抱歉"012---"Tell Monica I'm sorry."
你自己去告诉她012---Tell her yourself.
喔  我的天啊  钱德走了012---Oh, my God. Chandler just left, though?
或许事情不是我们想的那样  或许他是说012---Yeah but, maybe it's not what we think. Maybe it's:
"告诉摩妮卡我很抱歉   我把最后的牛奶都喝光了"012---"Tell Monica I'm sorry I drank the last of the milk."
或许他写这张字条想告诉她  他改了名字012---Or maybe he was writing to tell her that he's changed his name: y'know?
告诉摩妮卡  我叫 "抱歉"012---Tell Monica, I'm Sorry.
这表示他很惊慌失措逃跑了  不要那么悲观012---I think it means he freaked out and left! Don't be so negative!
天啊  有没有可能 "抱歉"   现在就坐在里面012---Good God, isn't it possible that "Sorry" is sitting in there right now?
菲比  我想罗斯说得对  我们该怎么办012---Okay. Phoebe, I think Ross is right. What are we gonna do?
我得去找他  把他带回来012---Look—Okay, I'm just gonna-- I'm gonna have to go find him and bring him back. Okay?
你们别让摩妮卡发现  好吗012---You make sure Monica does not find out, okay?
好  但是你如果没办法找到他  把他带回来012---Okay? But, if you don't find him and bring him back...
我会把你摁倒在地   然后痛扁你012---...I am gonna hunt you down and kick your ass!
我会  我会找到他的012---I will, I will find him.
乔伊  你能跟我对一下台词吗012---Hey Joey, Can you go through these lines with me?
喔  天啊  他们才帮我补好妆012---Oh, man, they just re-did my makeup.

你能不能把剧本放下来012---Could you uh, could you lower your script?
我不愿意012---I don't want to.
我得看到你的脸的表情  好作出反应来演出012---I need to see your face so I can play off your reaction.
好吧  听我说012---Okay, look.
我知道你的演技很棒   演过很多莎翁名剧012---I know you're great actor, okay? And you play all those Shakespeare guys and stuff...
但你老是喷得我满脸是口水012---...but you're spitting all over me, man.
那当然  你知道你会喷口水012---Well of course I am! You know you've been spitting on me?
真正的演员都会那么做012---That's what real actors do.
清晰地发音是一个好演员的特质012---Enunciation is the mark of a good actor.
要清晰地发音  就要喷口水012---And when you enunciate, you spit!
哇  还有这样的012---Wow. Didn't know that.
谢了  好吧  看我的012---Thanks. Okay, check it out.
照片  什么照片012---Picture? What picture?
阿甘  你看到钱德了吗  不  我没有看到他012---Gunther have you uh, have you seen Chandler? No, No. I haven't seen him.
该死  他明天要结婚了  对吧012---Damn. He's getting married tomorrow, right?
对  别担心  一切都会没事的012---Yes. Yes. Don't worry. Everything's fine.
明天婚礼上见  我没有被邀请012---we'll see you at the wedding. I wasn't invited.
那么后天见012---Well then we'll-we'll see you the day after tomorrow.
妈  爸012---Morn? Dad?
你们在这里做什么012---What-what…what you guys doing here?!
你们老是聊到这个地方  我们想看看这里有什么特别的012---Well you kids talk about this place so much, we thought we'd see what all the fuss is about.
我知道为什么女孩们喜欢来这里  为什么012---I certainly see why the girls like coming here. Why?
为了吧台后面那个金发性感大帅哥012---The sexy blonde behind the counter.
阿甘  你妈刚把他列入她的名单012---Gunther? Your mother just added him to her list.
什么  你的名单  我们可以上床的对象012---What?  Your list? Yeah, the list that—Of people we're allowed to sleep--
不  不  我知道那是什么样的名单012---Yes! No-no! I know, I know what the list is.
快坐下吧  喝杯咖啡012---Sit down, have a cup of joe.
爸  我没空  抱歉012---Dad? I can't, I'm sorry.
如果你们看到钱德  告诉他我在找他012---Look if you see Chandler, could you just let him know I'm looking for him.
如果你看到丽塔莫雷诺  告诉她我在找她012---And if you see Rita Moreno, let her know I'm looking for her.
开始012---Action!
我发现照片了012---I found the picture!
什么照片012---What picture?
我在你的背包里  发现我太太的照片012---A picture of my wife, in your pack!
你偷翻我的私人物品012---You went through my personal property?
你的背包里  为什么会有宝丽蒂的照片012---Why do you have a picture of Paulette in your pack?
文森  因为我们012---Because, Vincent, we were lovers...
交往过两年012---...for two years!
卡  太棒了012---Cut! Wonderful!
真的是太棒了012---Great scene, huh?
你真的很棒  最后那一段你喷得我的脸都湿了012---You were awesome. And, in that last speech, you soaked me.
这是明天你的通告表  我明天没工作呀012---Here's your call sheet for tomorrow. I'm not working tomorrow.
现在有了  不  不  你得帮我这个忙012---You are now. No! No! I can't! you gotta get me out of it.
我已经有约了  这件事非常重要012---I have got plans. Important plans!
罗斯说还是没有钱德的消息  喔  天啊012---Ross said there's still no word from Chandler. Oh, man.
但他们发现  奶奶在第五大道上游荡012---Oh but he did say that they found the grandmother wandering down 5th.
好吧  至少找到一个人了012---Okay, well there's one down.
我今天要结婚了012---I'm getting married today!
我断了一根肋骨  但我不在乎  因为我今天要结婚了012---I think I just cracked a rib, but I don't care because today's my wedding day!
我终于要结婚了012---My day is finally here!
或许她不会注意到他不见了012---Y'know she might not even notice he's gone.
我要开始准备了012---I'm gonna start getting ready!
我们不能让她开始准备  这太可怕了012---God! Don't—We can't let her start getting ready. This is too awful!
等她换上婚纱  而他又没有出现012---Oh God, but wait she'll be in the gown, and then he won't show up.
这时候她就得脱掉婚纱012---and then she'll have to take off the gown--
停  冷静点  你不能在这里抓狂012---Stop it. Stop it Rachel! You can't do this here.
对不起  抱歉012---I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
那真的是太伤感了012---It's just...It's just so sad.
振作一点  别让她看到你这个样子012---Yeah, but you've got to pull yourself together! Monica can't see you like this.
她会发现不对劲的  我知道  我知道012---Then she'll know something's wrong. I know. I know.
天啊  没有面纸了012---Oh God. There's no tissue.
你能拿张卫生纸给我吗012---Can you grab me some toilet paper?
喔  卫生纸也没有了  这里是摩妮卡的浴室吧012---Oh, that's gone too. This is Monica's bathroom, right?
我找到一张了  好吧012---No-no! I-I...I found one. Okay.
谢谢012---Oh thank you.
喔  天啊012---Oh, God.
能再给我一张吗012---Can I have another one?
没问题012---Sure.
你需要牙线吗012---Do you need some floss?
我无法想像如果钱德不出现  会发生什么事012---Oh God I just can't imagine what will happen if Chandler doesn't show up.
这里有一大堆卫生纸012---Oh here's a whole bunch.
她会穿着婚纱在礼堂等他012---Oh, I mean she'll be at the wedding waiting for him ...
大家会窃窃私语  "喔  那个可怜的女孩"012---...and people will be whispering, "Oh that poor girl."
然后她还得回到这里  独自一个人生活012---Y'know? Then she'll have to come back here and live all alone.
喔  我的天啊  干嘛012---Oh, my God. What?
垃圾桶有一根验孕棒  是阳性反应012---There was a pregnancy test in the garbage, and it's positive.
摩妮卡怀孕了012---Monica's pregnant.
我猜她不会寂寞了012---So I guess she won't be totally alone.
下集提要012---Next time on Friends:
我们得告诉她  他失踪了  不  我们不能那么做012---We've gotta tell her that he's gone. No, we can't.
她很快就会开始做准备012---She's gonna start getting ready soon.
你不能拖延她吗012---Can't you stall her a little?
我永远都没办法结婚了012---I'm never gonna get married.
我们只拍一场戏  就你跟理查  他是职业高手012---We've just got one short scene. It's just you and Richard, and he's a pro.
你喝醉了吗  没有012---Are you drunk? No!
你喝醉了  好吧012---Yes, you are! All right.
钱德还好吗  他好极了012---How's Chandler? Great!
你在哪里  我还在片场里012---Where are you? On the set.
这将会是有史以来  最糟糕的一场婚礼012---This is turning into the worst wedding day ever.
我的天啊012---Oh, my God.
我知道  摩妮卡怀孕了012---I know. Monica's gonna have a baby.
这能算是她的 "新经验" 吗012---Hey, can this count as her "something new"?
我的天啊012---Oh, my God.
嘿  你觉得这就是钱德逃婚的原因吗012---Hey, do you think this is why Chandler took off?
不是  她应该是刚刚才验的孕  我昨晚倒过垃圾012---No, she had to have just taken that test because I took out the trash last night.
这将会是有史以来最糟糕的一场婚礼012---Oh God, this is turning into the worst wedding day ever!
新娘怀孕  新郎逃婚  我还拿着这个012---The bride's pregnant, the groom's missing and I'm still holding this.
菲比  我们不能告诉任何人这件事012---Okay Phoebe, we cannot tell anyone about this.
对  没错  好吗012---Right. Okay? Yeah. Okay?
嘿  等一下  你知道  她用哪种方法避孕吗012---Hey, wait. Do you know what kind of birth control she was uses?
不知道  怎么了012---No. Why?
将来会是个很好的广告啊012---Just for the future. This is hardly a commercial for it.
老友记  第七季  第24集  摩妮卡和钱德的婚礼(下集)012---Friends  S07E24  The One With Chandler and Monica's Wedding
有什么消息吗012---Anything?
没有  我跟在片场的乔伊谈过  他也没有他的消息012---No. I talked to Joey on the set, He hasn't heard from him.
我又去问了钱德的父母012---I talked to Chandler's parents again.
你跟她们说他失踪了  没有012---You told them he was missing? No.
我装作打电话过去跟他们聊天012---I made it seemed like I was just calling to chat.
我很确定她们两个  都以为我对她们有兴趣012---Pretty sure they both think I'm interested in them.
我们得告诉她他失踪了  不  不  我们不能那么做012---All right, we've got to tell her he's gone. No, Hey! Hey! we can't.
罗斯  她很快就会开始做准备了012---Ross, she's gonna start getting ready soon.
你能拖延一下她吗  我会把昨晚找过的地方再找一遍012---Well, can't you at least stall her a little? I'll go back to some of the places I went last night.
需要多少时间012---All right, well how much time do you need?
她最晚要什么时候开始准备012---Well how much time before she absolutely has to start getting ready?
顶多1个小时  给我两个小时012---One hour. Give me two.
那你干嘛问我012---Then why do you ask?
祝我好运  我跟你一起去012---Okay, wish me luck. Okay. I'm going with you.
为什么012---Why?
罗斯  你累了  你找了一夜了  很明显你不擅长找人012---Ross, you're tired. You've been looking all night. And clearly, you suck at this.
待会见012---All right, I'll see you guys later.
你知道该怎么拖延她吗012---Okay. Wait, do you know how you're gonna to stall her?
我会想出办法的  好吧  祝你好运012---I'll figure something out. Okay, good luck.
嘿  我想我们得先开始化妆  然后再弄头发012---Hey! Okay, so I thought we'd start with my makeup and then do my hair.
好吧  但你开始准备前  我想和你谈谈012---Okay. But before you do that, I need you to talk to me.
谈什么012---About what?
我永远都没办法结婚了012---I'm never gonna getting married!
你会的  你的真命天子快出现了012---Yeah you will. The right guy's just around the corner.
好吧  我们谈完了吗012---Okay, are we done with that?
不  我是认真的012---No Monica! I'm serious.
也许我该忘了这些  当个女同性恋或什么的012---Oh, maybe I should just forget about it. Become a lesbian or something.
跟你在一起的女人  真是个幸运儿012---Any woman would be lucky to have you.
或许我跟乔伊上床   会感觉好受一些012---Well maybe it would make me feel better if I slept with Joey.
瑞秋  你没事吧012---Rachel? You okay?
对不起  艾朗  我对计划通告表有点意见012---Excuse me, Aaron? Hi! Umm, I have a little problem with the schedule.
今天本来没有我的戏   我必须要去参加一个婚礼012---Originally, I wasn't supposed to work today. and I have this wedding that I really have to be at.
我最好的朋友要结婚   我是证婚人012---It's my best friend's, and I'm officiating...
我真的四点后就得走012---...so I really can't work past 4.
乔伊  你得待到戏拍完  我们不能因为你一个而暂停拍戏012---Joey, you've gotta stay until the end. We can't stop filming just for you.
又不是你要结婚012---It's not like it's your wedding.
我要动手术012---I'm having surgery.
什么012---What?
我骗你说我要结婚  因为我不希望你担心012---Yeah, I-I just made up the stuff about the wedding, because I didn't want you to worry about me.
但其实今天我要动手术012---But I'm having surgery today.
什么样的手术012---What kind of surgery?
移植手术012---Transplant.
但你星期一都得拍戏的012---But you're supposed to work on Monday.
毛发移植手术012---Hair transplant.
但你不是秃头012---But you're not bald.
不是在我头上移植012---It's not on my head.
我真的帮不上忙  或许你可以在四点前离开012---Look Joey, there's nothing I can do. Besides, you'll probably gonna be out by 4 anyway.
我们只要拍一场戏  就你跟理查  他是专业的012---We've got one short scene. It's just you and Richard, and God knows he's a pro.
没问题的012---You'll be fine.
早安  理查012---Morning, Richard.
你来了  太棒了  我们开始吧012---Hey, you're here. Great! Great! Great! Let's get going, buddy.
我们继续拍戏012---we've got a scene to shoot!
我系了两条皮带012---I'm wearing two belts.
你喝醉了吗  没有012---Are you drunk? No.
你喝醉了012---Yes, you are.
算是吧012---All right.
原来这就是你的办公室012---So this is your office?
你们怎么找到我的  我真应该躲在健身房里的012---How'd you guys find me? I knew I should've hid at the gym.
你到底在做什么啊   我在惊慌失措中012---What the hell are you doing? Panicking.
顺便上网找证据证明  我跟摩妮卡有血缘关系012---And using the Internet to try to prove that I'm related to Monica.
她还好吗  她很好  她不知道你失踪了012---How is she? She's fine. She doesn't know you're gone.
她也不必知道  走吧  我们回家了012---And she doesn't have to know. okay? Now come on, we're going home.
不  不   我做不到  为什么012---No! No! I can't do that. Why not?
如果我回去  我们就会成为宾氏夫妇012---Because if I go home, we're gonna become the Bings.
我不能当宾氏夫妇012---I can't be the Bings.
宾氏夫妇有什么不对的012---What's wrong with being the Bings?
宾氏夫妇的婚姻很可怕012---The Bings have horrible marriages.
他们会吵架  打成一团012---They yell, They fight, And they use the pool boy...
还会把救生员  当成他们性爱游戏的玩物012---...as a pawn in their sexual games.
