确实很可爱012---She sure does.
为什么要贴那个012---Why does she have a

村妇上衣跟A字裙时髦多了012---peasant blouses and Aline skirts.
我可以戴个蓝色的蝴蝶结吗012---Can I get a blue bow?

拷贝好  并划线标示出重要讯息012---photocopied and highlighted key passages..
然后以字母分类归档012---and put them into alphabetical folders,
给你充分的信息  好让你做决定012---so you can make an informed decision.
我在里面多久了012---How long was I in there?
好了  我们先从A开始  广告业012---Okay,let's start with the A's. Advertising.
等一下  广告  真是个好主意012---Wait. Advertising,that's a great idea.

广告最适合了012---Advertising makes perfect sense.

我也可以写广告语的012---I mean,I could write slogans.
能有多难呢 是不是012---How hard could it be,right?
"乳酪  可以咬的牛奶"012---"Cheese. It's milk that you chew."
"饼干  乳酪的良伴"012---"Crackers. Because your cheese needs a buddy."
"葡萄  西瓜太大  葡萄可一口塞下"012---"A grape. Because who can get a watermelon in your mouth?"
我想到一个012---I got one.

我跟他从小玩到大012---I grew up with a guy
现在他是一家大广告公司的副总012---who is a vice president at a big agency.
或许我可以请他跟你谈谈012---Maybe I can get him to meet you.

什么012---Excuse me?
你的宝宝真可爱012---Your baby's so cute.
但是为什么012---But why would you
在男孩头上贴个粉红色蝴蝶结呢012---put a pink bow on a boy?
嘿  乔伊  看看我012---Hey,Joey. Look at me.
我是护士耶012---I'm a nurse.
是啊  真是呢012---Yes,you are.
我想该是擦海棉澡的时候了012---I think it might be time for my sponge bath.
对不起  我太习惯泡临时演员了012---Sorry,I'm just so used to hitting on the extras.
你很期待出场吗012---So are you excited about your scene?
是啊  但是我有点紧张012---Yeah,but I'm a little nervous.
放轻松  别紧张  没事的012---Relax. Don't be. You will be fine.
他们可能只会要你站在后面012---They'll probably just make you stand in the background.
好了  好了012---OK. OK. OK
你  站这里  过来  这里  好的012---You. Here,come here. Here.  OK
你拿着这个托盘  站在黄线这里012---Take this tray,stand on this yellow mark.
听到"开拍"就开始移动012---You're gonna move on "action."
走向手术台  停在蓝线那边012---Walk over to the operating table,stop on the blue mark
然后把托盘放下012---and put the tray down.
别走太快012---Don't walk too fast.
但是也别太慢012---But don't dawdle.
好吧  到底是怎样012---Okay. Now,what?
开拍012---And,action!
停  停012---Cut! Cut.
我很抱歉  我只是有点紧张012---I'm sorry. I'm just a little nervous.
那就别紧张012---Well,don't be.
好吧  你的话真"有用"012---Okay,that helps.
开拍012---And,action!
停012---Cut!
那个  别担心  菲比012---You know what? Don't worry about it,Phoebe.
我通常也要3次才能拍成功012---It usually takes me three takes too.
好啦  是8次012---All right,eight.
开拍012---And,action!
那你对于广告还有其他问题吗012---So do you have any other questions about advertising?
没有  但是让我表演一下我的专长012---No. But let me show you what I can do.

我想我们公司可能有个适合你的职务012---I think we might have something for you at the agency.
真的吗  太好了012---Really? That's great.
有个不付薪水的实习职位012---It's an unpaid internship.
真好笑  当你说"不付薪水"的时候012---That's funny. When you said "unpaid,"
听起来好像是"不给钱"的意思012---it sounded like you said "unpaid."
别这样  莫妮卡有份很不错的工作012---Come on,now. Monica has a good job.
又不是说你要养家糊口012---It's not like you have a family to support.
事实上  我们正想生个孩子012---Actually,we're trying.
我不认为莫妮卡想要延期012---I don't think Monica is gonna want to postpone it.
我们原打算今晚做爱的012---We're supposed to have sex tonight.
事实上  她现在或许就在家012---Actually,she's probably at home,
一丝不挂的012---naked right now.
如果没有人阻止我  我会一直说话012---I tend to keep talking till somebody stops me.
我可以想像她在床上的样子  停012--- I can just picture her on the bed.  Stop!
好吧012---OK.
等等012---Wait a minute.
你说要接替我的工作是什么意思012---What do you mean you're taking over my job?
你休产假的时候012---While you were on your baby vacation,
你的工作是我在做的012---I was doing your job.
假期  我对假期的定义可不包括012---A vacation? My idea of a vacation does not involve..
让什么东西吸我的乳房  吸到破皮012---something sucking on my nipples until they are raw.
很显然  你从未去过天堂度假岛012---Clearly,you've never been to Sandals Paradise lsland.
好了  别让你自己太舒服012---All right. Don't get too comfortable there,
因为我两个星期之后就回来了012---because I'm back in two weeks.
我要一切回归原状012---I want everything back the way it was.
我实在不太满意012---I can't say I care too much
你重新摆设我办公室的方式012---for the way you've rearranged my office.
我也实在不太满意你带进来的臭味012---I can't say I care too much for that smell you've brought in.
你说什么012---Excuse me?
瑞秋  我们面临"棕色警报状况"012---Rach,we have a code brown situation.
亲爱的  可以拜托你帮我处理一下吗012---Honey,could you please take care of it for me?
好吧  但是有时候你也该处理一次012---All right,but you're gonna have to do one sometime.
让我把话说清楚012---Let me just get this straight.
我去生个小孩012---So I go have a baby,
然后他们派一个人过来接我的工作012---and they send some guy in to do my job?
本来说要关闭整个罗夫罗兰的012---Well,there was talk of shutting down Ralph Lauren altogether.
好了  你真是个不要脸的临时工012---Okay. Right. You're very cheeky for a temp.
我不是临时工012---I'm not a temp.
我是从别的部门调过来的012---I was transferred here from another department.
是什么部门呢  混蛋部门吗012---And what department was that? The jerk department?
他们并没有告诉我  你反应是如此快012---They didn't tell me about your quick wit.
那他们有没有告诉你012---Well,did they mention
我是橡胶  你是胶水吗012---that I'm rubber and you're glue?
加文  罗夫很喜欢你的创意012---Gavin,Ralph loved your ideas.
嗨  泽纳先生012---Hi,Mr. Zelner.
瑞秋  我想你见过加文了012---Rachel. I see you've met Gavin.
当你离开的时候012---When you left us,
我们都不知道该怎么办012---we weren't sure what we were gonna do.
但是  加文拯救了我们  超级加文012---But then,Gavin to the rescue. Super Gavin.
噢  太好了  太好了012---Well,that's great. that's great.
那么  超级加文  当我回来以后012---So now,Super Gavin,when I come back..
你计划要飞到哪去呢012---where do you plan on flying off to?
全看泽纳先生的意思012---That's up to Mr. Zelner.
我相信他会做出正确的决定012---I'm sure he'll make the right decision.
超级马屁精012---Super asskissing power.
对了  你什么时候回来呢012---Incidentally,when are you coming back?
今天012---Today.
你刚刚说两星期后012---You said two weeks.
不  我是说今天012---No,I said today.
看吧  身为超级英雄012---See,for a superhero,
听话能力有点差劲哦012---not so much with the listening.
他怎么说呢012---So,what'd he say?
他有时候有点粗暴012---He can be a little rough around the edges..
所以我打算将他使用012---so I'm gonna replace a word
频率很高的一个脏字换成"小狗"012---he used a lot with the word "puppy."
他说  如果你的"小狗"朋友012---So he said,"If your puppy friend
不能"小狗"演好她的角色012---doesn't get her puppy act together..
我将会"小狗"般地开除她012---I am gonna fire her motherpuppy ass."
我很抱歉  我办不到012---I'm sorry. I can't do this.
我不是演员的料012---I'm just not an actor.
没错  你不是演员  你是护士012---That's right. You're not. You're a nurse.
你是拿托盘的护士  别  乔伊012--- You're Nurse With Tray.  No,Joey..
不  拿托盘的护士不认识乔伊的012---No, no. Nurse With Tray doesn't know Joey.
她没有时间交朋友012---She has no time for friends.
她进去手术室012---She gets in that operating room
把托盘交给医生012---and she carries that tray to the doctor..
因为如果她不这样做  会死人的012---because if she doesn't,people die.
谁会死012---Who dies?
戴眼罩的男人012---Man With Eye Patch!
现在你过去做好你的工作012---Now,you get in there,and you do your job.
遵命  医生  好的012--- Yes,doctor. OK
好了  我们再试一次012---Okay,let's try this one more time.
撑着点  戴眼罩的男人012---Hang in there,Man With Eye Patch.
你的托盘来了012---Your tray is coming.
开拍012---And,action.
太棒了  我办到了  我搞定了012---Yes,I did it! I nailed it!
接下来是什么呢012---What's next?
继续后面的剧情012---The rest of the scene.
好吧  大家  从头开始012---Okay,from the top,people.
听着  计划有变012---Listen,sudden change of plans.
我的产假刚刚结束了012---My maternity leave just ended.
他们说如果我不今天回去工作012---They said if I didn't come back today,
他们就要开除我012---they'd fire me.
什么 那是非法的012---What? No,that's illegal.
我要马上通知工会  他们不...012---I'll have the Labor Department here so fast,they won't..
好了  冷静点  诺玛蕾（工会创建者）012---All right,calm down,Norma Rae.
他们并没有真的那样说012---They didn't actually say that.
我只是害怕如果不现在回去012---I'm just afraid if I don't come back now,
那个男的会把我挤掉012---this guy will try and squeeze me out.
那艾玛怎么办呢012---But what about Emma?
我们还没有找到保姆012---I mean,we don't have a nanny.
我知道  我们只好今晚再想办法了012---I know. We're just gonna have to figure out a plan tonight.
今天你可以先照顾她吗012---Can you please just take care of her for today?
当然  只要把你的乳房给我012---Absolutely. Just give me your breasts,
我们马上就走012---and we'll be on our way.
别这样  我不知道还能怎么办012---Come on. I don't know what else to do.
好啦  好啦012---Fine. Fine.
我们会很开心的  不是吗012---We'll have fun,won't we?
是的  我们会  是的  我们012---Yes,we will. Yes,we..
罗斯012---Ross.
你好漂亮012---You're pretty.
不管我决定要做什么012---Whatever I decide to do,
我都得从基层做起012---I'm gonna be starting a new career from scratch.
得很长一段时间后才能活得滋润些012---It's gonna be a while before I make a living at it.
或许现在不是生小孩的好时机012---Maybe now's not the right time to be starting a family.
所以你要跟莫妮卡说012---So you have to tell Monica
你现在不想要生小孩012---you don't want to have a baby right now?
是啊012---Yeah.
永别了012---Goodbye.
好了  造人时间  裤子脱掉  宾012---Okay,it's baby time. Pants off,Bing.
没看到你也在  盖勒012---Didn't see you there,Geller.
罗斯在这里  所以012---Ross is here,so..
我真的希望  可以跟你们待在一起012---And I was really hoping that maybe I could hang out.
你们想做什么呢012---You know,what do you feel like doing?
我们想要做爱012---Well,we're gonna have sex.
我倒是不太想做爱012---I don't feel like having sex.
或许  我不知道012---Maybe.. I don't know.
或许我们可以一起看电影什么的012---Maybe we can watch a movie or something.
我就直说了吧012---Let me put it this way:
不管你在不在  我们都要做爱012---We're having sex whether you're here or not.
裤子脱掉  宾012---Pants off,Bing.
听着  现在既然我回来了012---All right. Now that I'm back,
何不向我报告一下012---why don't you just fill me in
你都干了些什么012---on what you've been up to.
嗯  我把你超级男孩的屏保改了012---Well,I've changed your screen saver from that picture of NSYNC.
嘿  我离开时  他们可是很受欢迎的012---Hey,they were popular when I left.
但我主要忙于准备012---Mostly I've just been working on
明天的一个重要报告展示012---this big presentation for tomorrow.
我应该要参与  向我说明一下吧012---I should be involved in that,so get me up to speed.
那得花上好几个星期012---That'll take weeks.
你不如就让我负责那个报告吧012---Why don't you just let me take care of the presentation.
不  我知道你在玩什么花样  好吗012---No. I see what you're doing here,all right?
听着  这是我的工作  老兄012---Listen, this is my job,buddy.
我已经做了五年了  我知道一切流程012---I've had it for five years,and I know how it works.
所以赶快向我汇报说明  好012--- So why don't you just catch me up.  Fine.
天啊012---Oh,God.
你把我椅子的高度完全变了012---You've totally messed with the back support on my chair.
你是怎么弄的012---How do you fix this?
你已经在这里五年了012---You've been here five years.
你自己想吧  很好  我自己来012--- You figure it out.  Fine,I will.
好了  开始汇报吧012---All right,fill me in.
你有没有蓝色的领带配我的衣服012---Do you have a blue tie that would go with this?
艾玛吐奶到我的领带上012---Emma spit up on mine.
有啊  但等我找到工作时要还给我012---Yeah,but you have to give it back if I get a job.
当然  到那时候  领带已经被淘汰了012---Of course,by that time, future ties will be obsolete..
而我们都将穿起银色的连身装012---and we'll all be wearing silver jumpsuits.
早安  爱人012---Hey,good morning,lover.
我得说  经过昨夜的激战012---I gotta say,after last night,
我的双腿还在发软012---I'm a little weak in the knees.
麻烦你  每次走进来的时候012---Here's an idea. You walk into a room,
先快速看一下四周吧012---take a quick scan.
抱歉012---Sorry.
但是我有点觉得012---But I kind of have this feeling
我们昨晚造人成功了012---that we may have made a baby last night.
噢  天  我必须告诉你一件事012---Oh,God,I have to tell you something.
你没有怀孕012---You're not pregnant.
你在说什么012---What are you talking about?
嗯  能让你受精的那件事012---Well,that thing that I have to do to make a baby?
我装的012---I faked it.
什么  你装的012---What? You faked it?
你知道吗012---You know what?
我不需要领带了012---I don't need a tie.
我是说  领子开着比较好  不是吗012---I mean,it's better open collar,you know?
比较轻松自在012---It's more casual.
乔伊  听着  我办不到012---Joey. Listen,I can't do this.
简直是毫无道理012---It doesn't make any sense.
昨天我是护士  然后今天我是服务生012---Yesterday I was a nurse,and today I'm a waitress at a cafe?
有时候我们会用相同的临时演员012---Sometimes we use the same extras
扮演不同的角色  没关系的012---for different parts. It's okay.
是有关系的012---Well,it's not okay,
因为昨天我扮演护士  演的相当好012---because I gave a very memorable performance as the nurse.
然后现在突然间  我变成服务生012---And now,suddenly,I'm the waitress?
我的影迷们会混淆的012---That's gonna confuse my fans.
嗯  或许你是护士012---Well,maybe you are a nurse..
但是你也兼职当服务生012---but you moonlight as a waitress.
因为我是抚养两个小孩的单亲妈妈012---Because I'm a single mother supporting my two children.
没错012---Nice.

我会看着她012---I'll watch her.

那正是我要装的原因012---Well,that's actually why.
听着  我正在换工作012---Look,I'm starting a whole new career now.
我不是说我不想要孩子012---I'm not saying I don't want a baby.
只是  或许我们可以等一阵子012---I'm just saying maybe we could wait a little while.
一个月吗012---Like a month?
或是一年012---Or a year?
不是吧  你想要等一年012---Really? You wanna wait a year?
或许等不到一年012---It could be less than a year.
我是说  你知道我的能力012---I mean,you've heard my stuff.
"裤子  跟内裤一样  只是长一点"012---"Pants. Like shorts but longer."

不  我要你做你热爱的工作012---No,I want you to have a job that you love..
不是什么数据分析跟资料重组的012---not statistical analysis and data reconfiguration.

我觉得永远不会有012---I think there's never gonna be
适合生小孩的完美时机012---a right time to have a baby.
现在你失业了  但一阵子过后012---Now you're unemployed,and in a little while..
你就会找到一份让你忙不过来的工作012---you'll find a new job that'll keep you really busy.
总是会有理由不能生小孩的012---There's always gonna be a reason not to do this..
但是我想  一旦有了孩子012---but I think once the baby comes,
我们就会忘了这一切的理由012---we'll forget about all those reasons.
我想也是012---I guess.
我是说  有小孩总是很吓人的事012---I mean,it's always gonna be scary when we have a baby.
真的会是很吓人的012---It's gonna be really scary.

要是宝宝跑到缎带抽屉里012---What if the baby gets into the ribbon drawer..
把所有的缎带都弄乱了呢012---and messes up all the ribbons?
万一没有地方可以放缎带012---What if there's no room for a ribbon drawer..
所有的空间都被宝宝的东西占满了呢012---because the baby's stuff takes up all the space?
缎带要放哪呢012---Where will all the ribbons go?
要不要在你改变主意前  赶快去受孕012---Should we go make a baby before you change your mind?
是啊  快点  好的012--- Yes,please!  Okay.
而且我保证  这一次我不会装了012---And I promise I will not fake it this time.
我希望我也可以说相同的话012---Well,I wish I could say the same.
我仍有点战栗012---I'm a little shook up.
我知道你故意导致手术失败的012---I know you botched that operation on purpose.
我现在还没有办法证明012---I can't prove it yet,

你会因谋杀而坐牢的012---you'll be going to jail for murder.
我不在乎你是不是我弟弟012---I don't care if you are my brother.
