莫妮卡  你的保时捷能借我吗012---Monica? Hey, can I borrow the Porsche?
-好的  -太好了012---- Okay.  - All right!
有什么"不准"的呢012---But what is it not?
不准在车上和我女性朋友玩乐012---A place to entertain my lady friends.
还有什么呢012---And what else is it not?
不准在车上吃意大利面012---A place to eat spaghetti.
乖  你开车干嘛去012---Very good. What do you need it for anyway?
强力球彩票的奖金已经累积到三亿了012---The Powerball lottery is up to 300 million...
但是这里又没有卖的012---and they don't sell tickets here.
所以你要开车到康涅狄格州去买012---So you're driving up to Connecticut?
对  康涅狄格州  不是西弗吉尼亚州012---Yeah, Connecticut. Not West Virginia.
也许我可以开车载你去012---Maybe I'll drive you up there.
我也想买几张彩票012---I'd like to buy some tickets myself.
钱德勒不挣钱  这三亿我们可以用一下012---Yeah, with Chandler not getting paid, we could really use $300 million.
是的  如果我还是原来的工作012---Yes, because if I was at my old job,
我们会说"三亿元  不用  谢了"012---we'd say, ''300 million? No, thank you.''
你可以帮我买吗012---Will you get me tickets too?
对啊  我也要012---Yeah, me too.
-当然  -我有个主意012---- Sure.  - I have an idea.
我们一人拿五十块钱  一起买012---Why don't we all pitch in 50 bucks, we'll pool our money together...
如果我们中奖  大家平分012---and then if we win, we'll split it.
这主意不错012---That's a great idea!
不用  谢了012---No, thanks.
你不想要中彩票吗012---You don't wanna win the lottery?
我当然想012---Sure I do.
我还想当国王呢012---I also want to be king of my own country...
我还想知道阿梅莉亚·埃尔哈特怎么了012---...and find out what happened to Amelia Earhart.
还在想那个女飞行员吗012---Still on Amelia Earhart?
那女人就那样消失了012---The woman just vanished!
说真的  你真的不加入吗012---Seriously, you don't want in on this?
不要  你们知道012---No. Do you know what
中彩票的机率有多大吗012---your odds are of winning the lottery?
比你被雷劈四十二次的机率还小012---I mean, you have a better chance of being struck by lightning 42 times.
但是我们有六个人012---But there's six of us,
所以我们只需要被打到七次012---so we'd only have to get struck 7 times.
我喜欢这种机率012---I like those odds!
真的  你们  我不敢相信012---Seriously, you guys, I can't believe
你们居然花了两百五十块买彩票012---you're gonna spend $250 on the lottery.
这实在太狗便便了吧012---I mean, that's such a bunch of boo-hockey.
我来问012---I'll ask.
狗便便012---''Boo-hockey''?
艾玛已经要开始学说话了012---Oh, we think Emma's about to start talking...
所以我们在她面前会注意用词012---...so we're trying to be careful about what words we use in front of her.
准备好吧  你们会听到很多的狗便便012---So get ready to hear a lot of boo-hockey...
"去安息吧"还有"她母亲的"等等012---...gosh darn it and brother pucker.
你怎么知道她要开始说话了012---How do you know she's gonna start talking?
我跟她说话的时候012---When I talk to her,
我似乎感觉到  她好像能听懂012---I almost feel like she understands what I'm saying.
有点像乔伊012---Kind of like Joey.
你说什么012---What's that now?
《老友记》  第九季 第18集  彩票啊彩票012---Friends S09E18 The One With The Lottery
天啊  瞧瞧这些彩票  激动人心啊012---God, look at all these tickets. It's so exciting.
自从六年级后012---I haven't won anything
我就没有赢过任何东西了012---since sixth grade.
吃派大赛吗012---Pie-eating contest?
因为我原来很胖012---You assume because I was heavy
你就以为那是我唯一能赢的比赛吗012---that's the only way I could win something?
不  我看过你全身都是蓝莓的照片012---No, I saw a picture of you covered in blueberries.
-那天还真开心啊  -是啊012---- That was a good day.  - Yeah.
他们要把你的车拖走了012---They're towing your car!
我车停在莫顿的车库里012---I'm parked in a garage on Morton.
他们要把一辆车拖走了012---They're towing a car.
而我眼冒金星了012---And I am seeing spots.
罗斯  你没带艾玛012---Ross, you don't have Emma!
瑞秋  你也没有在带艾玛012---Rachel, you don't have Emma!
艾玛呢  艾玛到哪去了012---Where's Emma? Who has Emma?
乔伊  别紧张012---Joey, relax.
两小时前  我妈把她接走了  你也在啊012---My mother picked her up two hours ago. You were there.
有吗012---I was?
是的  你还跟她说话012---Yes, and you talked to her.
-我有吗  -她还带来了砂锅菜来012---- I did?  - She dropped off a casserole.
对  那个砂锅夫人012---Oh, yeah, the casserole lady.
你是过来看我们中大奖的吗012---Did you come by to watch us win the big bucks?
是啊  我还想在你们中奖后012---Yeah. And then I figured after you win,
全部到阳台上012---we can all go out to the balcony...
看小精灵在夜之彩虹上跳舞012---and see a night rainbow with gremlins dancing on top of it.
别碰电话  我来接012---Don't touch the phone! I'll get it!
-你觉得他有洗手吗  -你好012---- You think he washed his hands?  - Hello?
查理  有什么消息012---Hey, Charlie, what do you know?
怎么回事012---What's going on?
他们公司开始决定雇佣谁了012---Chandler's supposed to find out
钱德勒在等消息012---if he's getting a job at his agency.
但在十五名实习生中012---But out of 15 interns,
他们只聘请三个人012---they're only hiring three.
-机率真小  -是啊012---- Tough odds.  - Yeah.
像你们二十四州联合彩票的012---If only it were a sure thing
机率一样高012---like your 24-state lottery.
是啊  瞧瞧谁想通了012---Yeah, look who's coming around!
该死  好啦  有消息再通知我012---Damn it. All right, call me when you know more.
-用你了吗  -一个名额已经被占了012---- Did you get it?  - One of the slots got filled.
-被你吗  -听话听音012---- By you?  - Sense the tone.
不是我  是个叫内特的小子012---No, that kid Nate got it.
喔  我讨厌那小子012---Oh, I hate that guy.
真想说  有没有搞错012---I mean, come on,
小子  把裤子提上去012---kid, pull up your pants!
还有两个名额不是吗012---Well, there's two spots left, right?
是  我真的好想要  我想要被录取012---Yeah. I mean, I want this so much. I wanna get one.
也希望我朋友查理被录取012---I want my friend Charlie to get one.
其实我不是很在乎查理012---Except I don't care about Charlie.
-嘿  你们好  -嘿012---- Hey, you guys.  - Hey!
你们不会相信的012---You are not gonna believe this.
我刚刚遇到我的算命师傅012---I just saw my psychic.
她说我今晚一定会中彩票的012---and she said I was definitely gonna win the lottery tonight!
提醒我了  我想要增加好运012---That's reminds me.I thought we could use some extra luck...
所以从餐厅带了个幸运骨头回来012---...so I brought a wishbone home from work.
算命师傅再加上幸运骨头012---A psychic and a wishbone?
拜托给别人留点机会吧012---Guys, give someone else a chance.
好了  谁来012---All right, who wants to do it?
我可以吗012---Can I?
素食者从来就没机会玩幸运骨头012---Vegetarians never get to do the wishbone.
特别不公平  我们只是不吃肉012---It's really not fair. Just because we don't eat the meat...
不代表我们不喜欢玩尸骨012---...doesn't mean we don't like to play with the carcasses.
好了  瑞秋呢012---All right. Rach?
我不想要让手沾上火鸡的味道012---I don't want that turkey smell all over my hands.
我来  我要把砂锅菜的味道盖过去012---I'll do it! It'll get the casserole stink off of mine.
-希望我会赢  -嗯  没有关系012---- I hope I win.  - Well, it doesn't really matter.
你们的愿望是一样的012---You're both wishing for the same thing.
我不能告诉你我许什么愿012---I can't tell you what I'm wishing for,
要不然不会实现的012---or else, you know, it won't come true.
对  但是我们都知道你许什么愿012---Right. But we know what you're wishing for.
-我真不能讲出来  -我了解012---- I can't really say.  - I understand.
但你许的愿跟我们想的一样  不是吗012---But you're wishing for what we think, aren't you?
我真的很不喜欢这些问题012---I'm not really comfortable with these questions!
-拜托  -赶快做012---- Please!  - Just do it!
好的  一  二  三012---Okay. One, two, three.
我赢了  嘿012---I won! Hey!
你们知道吗012---You know what?
我确定你们的愿望会成真012---I'm sure your wish is gonna come true.
但是  为了以防万一012---But, you guys, just in case,
我们来擦这个灯  或许灯神会出现012---maybe a genie will come out if we rub this lamp.
那东西好烫啊012---That thing gets hot!
罗斯  你可以继续取笑我们012---Ross, just keep making your jokes.
万一我们真中奖了  你怎么想012---How are you gonna feel if we actually do win?
你们不会中的012---You're not gonna win.
我知道机率很小012---I know the odds are against us...
但是总是有人会中012---...but somebody has to win,
也有可能是我们  到时候你怎么想012---and it could be us. And then how you gonna feel?
我们会说"大家开直升机去海岬玩吧"012---We're gonna be like, ''Everybody, let's take our helicopters up to the Cape.''
而你只能说  我不行…012---And you're gonna be all, like, ''Oh, I can't, guys.
待会见好了  我得给我的现代加油012---I'll have to meet you up there. I gotta gas up the Hyundai.''
够了  我听过自己的录音012---Okay, I've heard myself on tape,
根本不是这样的012---and I sound nothing like that.
到时候头条新闻是这样的012---I can see the headline now:
"因见好友们中彩票012---''Lottery Winners' Friend,
懊悔不已   自食手臂"012---Filled With Regret, Eats Own Arm.''
我为什么要吃自己的手臂012---Why would I eat my own arm?
你当然不会012---Well, you wouldn't,
但我们可以买下那报社  爱怎么写就怎么写012---but we own the paper. We can print whatever we want.
你知道吗  我帮你出五十块好了012---You know what? I'm gonna throw in 50 bucks for you.
-为什么  -因为我知道你认为012---- Why?  - Because I know that you think...
彩票是很狗便便的东西012---that the lottery is boo-hockey...
但大家在一起等着开奖  会很好玩的012---...but we're all here, and we're gonna watch the numbers and have fun.
你是我哥  我希望你也有份012---And you're my brother, and I want you to be a part of this.
你不用这样  我自己付钱好了012---You don't have to do that. I mean, I'll pay for myself.
你想让我和你们一起开心012---But just the fact that you want me to have fun with you guys,
真的是太窝心了012---that's so sweet.
过来012---Come here.
开房去吧012---Get a room.
你已经加入了012---So now that you're in,
要是中奖了  你会干嘛012---what are you gonna do if we win?
我不知道  或许投资吧012---I don't know. I'll probably just invest it.
你能再冷静点吗012---Calm down.
正经点  这就是你的白日梦012---Seriously, that's your fantasy?
就是投资012---To invest it?
我很抱歉  我是说投资吗012---Oh, I'm sorry. Did I say, ''invest it''?
我的意思是"快乐的全部花光光"012---I meant, ''Be cool and piss it all away.''
我知道了  我们该把全部的钱凑起来012---I know! We should pool all our money
买下尼克斯队012---and buy the Knicks!
我不是很在乎尼克斯队012---I don't really care about the Knicks.
如果我选你当前锋  你就会了012---You will when I pick you as starting forward.
你会那样做吗  我从没有被选上012---You would do that? I never get picked!
我不确定球队会是正确的选择012---I'm not sure a sports team is the way to go.
你不让我买尼克斯队吗012---You won't let me buy the Knicks?
不敢相信你要打破我的梦想012---I can't believe you're taking this away.
你说的对  这个梦想已经有十五秒之久了012---You're right, it has been your dream for over 15 seconds.
还要多久才会摇奖  妈咪012---How long until they announce the numbers, Mommy?
这个也让我来  "妈咪"012---I'll take this one too. ''Mommy''?
喔  我要习惯叫瑞秋"妈咪"012---Oh, I've gotten into the habit of calling Rachel...
只要是艾玛在场012---...''Mommy'' when we're around Emma.
我现在发现她并不在012---Which I now realize we are not.
希望她听久了  她第一句话会说这个012---I'm hoping that if she hears it enough, it'll be her first word.
如果真的要这样做012---Although if we're gonna do that,
你也应该叫我"爹地"才对012---we should probably call me ''Daddy'' too.
我喜欢哦  爹地012---I like that, Daddy.
我只是在说瑞秋012---I was just talking about Rachel.
爹地生气了吗012---Is Daddy getting angry?
爹地要打我吗012---Is Daddy gonna spank me?
嗯  那要看012---Well, that depends.
你是不是不乖...012---Have you been a bad--?
不行  我演不下去012---No, I can't.
哈啰  嘿  查理  还有其他人吗012---Hello? Hello? Hey, Charlie. Did anybody else hear?
什么  苏珊拿到了  怎么会呢012---What? Susan got it? How?
喔  天啊  早知道我也跟他上床012---Oh, man, I would've slept with him!
好了  拜012---All right, bye.
老兄  我很抱歉012---Dude, I'm sorry. But hey,
还有一个名额  不是吗012---there's one spot left, right?
那也是查理的012---Well, Charlie's gonna get that.
别那样说012---Hey, don't say that.
你也有一样的机会012---You've got just as good a chance of getting that job.
他是老板的儿子012---He is the boss' son.
-来吧  彩票  -是啊012---- Come on, lottery!  - Yeah!
大概二十分钟就开奖了012---It starts in, like, 20 minutes.
好了  我们来吧012---Okay, here we go.
我们需要尽快分配这些彩票对奖012---We need to sort through the tickets quickly to see if we've won.
谁有主意要怎么安排吗012---So does anybody have any ideas how to organize this?
好的  这样如何012---Okay, how about this:
我们分成六组各四十张012---We divide them into six groups of 40.
剩下的十张就由先对完的人来对012---The remaining 10 can be read by whoever finishes first.
我还有一个主意012---I have another idea.
很抱歉  提议时间已经过了012---I'm sorry, idea time is over.
-所有的彩票都在碗里了吗  -是的012---- Well, are all the tickets in the bowl?  - Yeah.
那床头柜上面的那些呢012---What about the ones on the nightstand?
那边没有彩票012---There are no tickets there.
那边有  我几分钟前才看到012---Yes, there are. I just saw them a few minutes ago.
不对  没有  你看错了012---No, you didn't. You must be mistaken.
床头柜上有二十张彩票012---There are 20 tickets on the nightstand.
钱德勒  听话听音012---Chandler, sense the tone.
哎呦喂  瞧瞧妈咪找到了什么012---Well, well, well. Look what Mommy found.
好啦  我给自己和钱德勒多买了二十张012---Okay, fine. I bought 20 extra tickets for me and Chandler.
算命的还说我会被朋友背叛012---The psychic also said that I would be betrayed.
我不敢相信  我以为我们是一起的012---I can't believe this. I thought we were all in this together.
你五分钟前才加入的012---Hey, you just got in five minutes ago!
是三分钟前012---Three minutes ago!
我不知道那有什么重要的012---I don't know why that's important.
我们一直在一起012---I was with you the whole time.
你是什么时候买的012---When did you even get those?
就在你看未拆封的色情书刊的时候012---When you were reading the dirty magazines without taking off the plastic.
我教你012---I'll show you how.
好了  莫妮卡012---Okay. Well, Monica,
假设你的额外彩票中奖了怎么办012---suppose one of your special tickets wins?
你中了彩票但失去了朋友  你怎么办012---How are you gonna feel when you win and lose your friends?
拜托  如果我中奖了012---Please. If I win the lottery,
你们才不会离开我012---you guys are not gonna leave me.
上星期有人给我些小松饼012---Someone gave me muffins last week,
就让你们骚扰了我整整三天012---and I couldn't get rid of you for three days!
钱德勒  你可以告诉她这是不对的吗012---Chandler, would you just tell her what she did was wrong?
她说得对012---She's right.
你不应该帮我们两个另买彩票012---You shouldn't have bought tickets just for us.
让我说完012---Let me finish.
然而  看起来我好像得不到这份工作了012---However, it doesn't look like I'm gonna get this job...
原则太贵  承受不起012---...so I can't afford to have principles.
所以  去你们的  彩票是我们的012---So screw you! The tickets are ours!
我嫁了个好男人012---There's the man I married.
好了  相信我  如果你们中奖了012---All right. Believe me, if you win the lottery
我们不再是朋友012---it's the last you're gonna hear from us.
无所谓  不用你们当朋友012---Fine. Don't be my friends.
我会买新朋友012---I'll buy new friends.
是的  我还会付钱让他们做整形手术012---Yeah, and then I'll pay for their plastic surgery
变得跟你们一模一样012---so they look just like you!
你知道吗  我要拿回我的份012---You know what? I want my share of the tickets.
我也要拿回我的012---I want my tickets too!
而且我要买下尼克斯队012---And I'm buying the Knicks!
还有施特菲·格拉芙（德国网球运动员）012---And Steffi Graf!
太好了  那我也要拿回我的012---Cool. Then I want mine too!
如果我中奖…012---And if I win...
我要拿全部的钱去买低利公债012---I'm gonna put it all into a very low-yield bond!
不行  我们必须要把彩票放在一起012---No. You guys, we gotta keep all the tickets together.
不  我们应该分一分012---No. No, we should divide them up...
而且我应该多分点012---...and I should get extra
因为是开我的车买的012---because we used my car!
如果有人可以多拿一些012---Hey! Hey! If anybody gets extra tickets,
那也应该是我012---it should be me!
这整件事都是我想出来的012---This whole thing was my idea!
是啊  谢谢你发明彩票012---Yeah. Thanks for inventing the lottery!
把彩票给我  我来分012---Just give them to me, and I'll split them up!
嘿  嘿012---Hey, hey!
天啊  我再也受不了了012---God, I can't take it anymore!
我来结束这一切012---I'm putting an end to this!
如果她跳楼了  她的彩票就是我的012---Okay, if she jumps, I get her tickets!
等等  不  嘿012---Wait, no, no! Hey!
要么同进退  要么一切归零012---If we're not doing this together, we're not doing it at all.
跟你们的彩票说再见吧012---Say goodbye to your tickets.
不  不  不012---No! No! No!
不要再靠近过来了012---Do not come any closer!
我可以再靠近一点点吗012---Can I come a little bit closer?
我的宝贝被压到了012---Valuable things are getting squished.
现在  什么比较重要012---Now, what's more important,
朋友还是钱012---your friends or money?
-朋友  -钱012---- Friends!  - Money!
朋友012---Friends.
嘿  莫妮卡  那你额外的彩票呢012---Hey, Monica, what about your extra tickets?
全都在里面了012---They're all in there.
还有我内衣藏的这五张012---Even these five that I hid in my bra.
莫妮卡012---Monica!
好的  很好  你们都吓坏了012---Okay. Good. You guys were so scared.
我才不会丢掉这些...012---There is no way I was gonna dump this--
天啊  不012---God! No!
我好像把你的碗摔破了012---I think I broke your bowl.
快快快012---Go! Go! Go!
多美好的夜晚啊  到街上去找彩票012---What a beautiful night to be running around the street, looking for tickets.
而且被风一吹就更有趣了012---And the wind sure made it fun.
菲比  有一半不见了012---Phoebe, we lost half of them.
那又怎样012---So what?
莫妮卡  我们还是会中奖的012---Monica, we have the winning ticket.
算命师傅说我会中奖的  记得吗012---My psychic said I was gonna win, remember?
奇怪的是012---Weird your psychic didn't mention
算命师没算到可怕的鸽子012---anything about the scary pigeon.
她有说过  我就是那么死的012---As a matter of fact, she said that's how I'm going to die.
所以  原谅我有点被吓到012---So excuse me for being a little skittish.
有两通留言  可能是工作的消息012---There's two messages. This could be from work.
-放出来  -好了  来了012---- Oh, play them.  - Okay. Here we go.
你好  我是阳台上的鸽子012---Hello. This is the pigeon from the balcony
打电话过来道歉的012---calling to apologize.
我不应该把彩票012---I shouldn't have knocked the tickets
从那个漂亮小姐手中弄翻012---out of the pretty lady's hand.
全是我的错  不关她的事  拜012---It was all my fault. Not hers. Bye.
嗯  他这道歉能做到一定很难012---Well, I bet that was very hard for him to do.
嘿  钱德勒  我是查理012---Hey, Chandler, it's Charlie.
就是这个了012---This is it.
