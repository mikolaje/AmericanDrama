感觉太舒服了012---Oh, that feels so good.
哎呀  我运气真好012---Oh, lucky me.
有咖啡喝还可以看现场性爱演出012---Coffee and a live sex show.
不好意思  你说什么012---l'm sorry, what?
不好意思012---l'm sorry.
没事  我只是在念书给艾玛听012---Nothing. l was just reading to Emma.
念《时尚》杂志吗012---From Cosmo?
是啊  是啊  是…012---Yeah. Yeah, it's:
《让你有更细致的肌肤》012---''Climax Your Way to Better Skin.''
我今天必须要去买衣服012---So l have to go shopping today,
这真是我最不喜欢做的事012---which is my least favorite thing.
我实在是很不会挑选衣服012---l'm so bad at picking out clothes.
所以你需要有很了解012---So you need someone who knows fashion
时尚的人来给你建议012---to tell you what looks good.
不要是我...012---Not me...
嘿  瑞秋012---Oh, hey, Rach?
怎样012---Yeah?
或许你可以带查莉去买衣服012---Maybe you could take Charlie shopping?
喔  嗯…012---Oh, well....
你可能很忙没空吧012---l'm sure you have better things to do.
你在开玩笑吗012---You kidding?
瑞秋爱死逛街了012---Rachel loves to shop,
而且她品味极佳012---and she has great taste.
就是她教我在劳动节之后012---She's the one that taught me,
不要穿白色衣服012---you don't wear white after Labor Day...
而且永远永远记住012---...and to always, always, always
在试穿衣服时一定要穿内衣裤012---put on underwear when trying on clothes.
如果你有空012---lf you have the time,
我真的需要你的帮忙012---l'd really appreciate the help.
好的  好啊  我们逛街去012---Okay. Yeah, let's shop.
好的  你一定会012---Okay, you are gonna come back
买回来很多有格调的衣服012---with some very classy clothes.
还有一些淫荡的内衣  淫荡喔012---And some slutty lingerie. Slutty!
好的  太好了  拜拜012---Okay, great. All right, bye.
烦死了012---Pain in the ass!
已经挂掉了  对吧012---That's off, right?
怎么了  菲比012---What's the matter, Pheebs?
迈克的姐姐刚邀请我012---Mike's sister just invited me
去今晚的派对012---to a party tonight
而且他也会去012---and he's gonna be there.
她说  "别担心012---She was like, ''Don't worry.
我问过他了012---l asked him
完全不介意见到你"012---and he's totally okay with seeing you.''
所以现在我一定得去了012---So now l have to go so he'll think
以便让他感觉我完全不介意见他012---that l'm totally okay with seeing him.
你根本就很介意012---Which you're not.
因为你还没有忘记他012---Because you're hung up on him.
没错012---Exactly.
你想要他懊悔不已012---You want him to eat his heart out,
所以你一定要看起来艳光四射012---so you have to look fabulous.
我根本没有那样想过012---l didn't even think about that.
性别政治012---Sexual politics!
菲比  我要带查莉去逛街012---Pheebs, l'm taking Charlie shopping.
一起来  我可以帮你挑衣服012---Come and l'll help you find something.
太棒了012---That'd be great.
真是太好了  你们三个人012---Oh, isn't that nice? The three of you,
一起试穿淫荡睡衣012---trying on slutty lingerie together.
我们没有要那样做012---That's not what we're gonna do.
你为什么要打断我012---Why'd you ruin it?
我这么想会伤害到谁012---Who was l hurting?
《老友记》  第九季 第22集  精子捐献者012---Friends S09E22 The One With The Donor
还好她长得很漂亮012---Fortunately, she has a very pretty face.
我还是无法相信012---l still can't believe this.
我的子宫是不适着床的环境012---My uterus is an inhospitable environment?
我一直都很努力012---l've always tried so hard
想要当个称职的女主人012---to be a good hostess.
我不敢相信我的精子的活动力太低012---l can't believe my sperm have low motility.
告诉你  当我在长大的时候012---Because let me tell you, while l was growing up,
它们倒是等不及要到处去游玩012---they sure seemed to be in a hurry to get places.
嗨012---Hi there.
嗨012---Hi.
关于你们上星期的测试我很抱歉012---l'm sorry there wasn't better news
没有什么更好的消息012---from your tests last week...
但是我想要跟你们谈谈012---...but l wanted to talk to you
你们可有的选择012---about your options.
好的012---Okay.
首先012---Well,first of all.
虽然你们以正常方式012---Even though your chances of conceiving
受孕的机率很低…012---through natural means aren't great...
但是很难定论的012---...you never know,
所以你们还是持续进行性生活012---so keep having sex on a regular basis.
哦  不要012---Oh, damn it!
别担心012---Don't worry.
等一下你就会习惯了012---After a while, you'll tune it out.
在这种情况之下012---Given your situation,
最佳的选择就是…012---the options with the greatest chances for success...
代孕母亲或是经由捐赠精子受孕012---...would be surrogacy or insemination using a sperm donor.
好吧012---Ok.
如果你们认为上述012---lf you feel that neither of those
两种选择都不适合012---is right for you,
你们还是可以选择领养012---you could always adopt.
这是个暗示吗012---ls that a hint?
我们是很爱你的  唐纳利医生012---Because we love you, Dr.Connelly,
但是我们不想要领养你012---but we don't want you to be our child.
喔012---Wow!
还说别人的环境不好客012---Talk about an inhospitable environment.
嗨  你准备好要去接菲比012---Hi. Okay, you ready to go pick up Phoebe
逛街了吗012---and go shopping?
我们走吧012---Let's do it.
好的  祝你们逛得愉快012---All right, have a good time.
那里面是找不到衣服的012---Not gonna find any clothes in there.
你们好012---Hey, you guys.
嗨012---Hi.
猜猜看谁是012---Guess who's up for keynote speaker
全国古生物学大会的主讲人012---at the National Paleontology Conference?
克里斯·培利012---Chris Bailey?
对啊  是啊012---Yeah, right.
他上次准时提交012---When was the last time
摘要是什么时候呢012---he made a submission deadline for an abstract?
你为什么要笑呢012---Why are you laughing?
只是想了解一下012---Just seeing what it'd be like
当古生物学家是怎样的012---to be a paleontologist.
真好玩  是啊012---lt's fun. Yeah.
所以你要当主讲人012---So you're up for keynote speaker?
是谁做的决定呢012---Who's deciding?
薛曼教授012---Professor Sherman.
我今天要跟他见面012---l'm meeting with him today.
要想感动他可不容易012---He's a pretty tough guy to impress.
我知道怎么让他惊奇012---l think l know how to dazzle him.
你应该不会是要变个魔术012---You're not gonna to do a magic trick,
对吧012---are you?
不是012---No.
大家好012---Hey, guys.
等一下012---Wait a minute, you guys.
我想要问你们一个问题012---l want to ask you something.
我可能会在这个古生物学大会演说012---l may get to speak at this paleontology convention.
如果是这样  我想邀请你们012---lf l do, l'd love for you guys
来听我的演讲012---to come and hear me.
我想我们肯定会因为有家庭012---l think l can safely say that
工作或是身体不适等理由而去不成012---we all have family issues, work and/or are sick.
是在巴巴多斯012---lt's in Barbados.
但是你是最重要的012---But you come first.
我去定了012---l'm there.
待会见012---See you later.
好的  拜012---Okay, bye.
拜  再见012---Bye. See you.
拜012---Bye.
验孕诊所怎么说012---So how did it go at the fertility clinic?
不像上次一样好玩012---Not as much fun as last time.
很明显地  他们只有在采精子样本时012---Apparently, you only get porn
才会给你看色情书刊012---if you're giving a sperm sample.
那医生怎么说呢012---So, what did the doctor say?
可以用代孕母亲  但莫妮卡这一辈子012---There's surrogacy, but Monica's dreamt
都在梦想怀孕…012---her whole life of carrying a child...
而她会觉得看着代孕母亲怀孕012---...and she just felt that watching
对她而言会太难受了012---a surrogate would be too hard for her.
所以你们不考虑代理孕母012---So you're ruling out surrogacy?
没错012---Yeah.
所以我不用知道那是什么意思012---So l don't have to learn what that means?
除了领养外012---Aside from adoption,
剩下的选择就是接受精子捐赠012---the only other choice is insemination...
所以我们现在在讨论精子捐赠者的事012---...so we're talking about sperm donors.
够了  我随时为你效劳  兄弟012---Enough said. l'm there for you, man.
她在哪  楼上吗012---Where is she, upstairs?
那你的感觉呢012---So how do you feel about all this?
我真希望我们有012---l wish there was an easier way
更简单的方式可生孩子012---for us to have a child,
但是我们并没有选择012---but there isn't one.
别这样  罗斯  做做好人012---Come on, Ross, be a good guy.
挺身而出吧012---Step up and do it.
什么012---What?
什么  不   我不会把本给他们的012---What?! No! l'm not gonna give them Ben!
我们从核磁共振成像012---The data we're receiving
跟脱氧核糖核酸测试所取得的化石...012---from MRl scans and DNA testing...
资料数据是很惊人的012---...of these fossils are staggering.
我的意思是我们一直以来都将012---l mean, we've been accepting
李奇年代法视为理所当然012---Leakey's dates as a given.
但是如果它的误差012---But if they're off
即使只有十万年左右…012---by even a 100,000 years or so...
那你可以舍弃我们大部分推论…012---...then you can just throw most of our assumptions...
你知道的  丢到垃圾桶里012---...you know, right in the trash.
所以  我要说的是…012---So, what l'm saying is....
是…012---ls that....
是所受影响的后果是很大的012---ls that repercussions could be huge.
我是说  不只是在古生物学012---l mean, not just in paleontology,
但是如果你仔细想想…012---but if you think about it...
甚至是在进化生物学  基因学  地质学012---...in evolutionary biology, genetics, geology.
我是说  真的  无限想像的空间012---l mean, truly, the mind boggles.
嗯  结果不该是这样的012---Well, that's not what you want.
试试"男人的诱惑"香水012---lncentive for Men?
我要喷一点012---l'll take some of that.
菲比  那是男生的香水012---Pheebs, that's for men.
我知道012---l know.
在我等一下去派对时...012---When l go to the party later...
迈克会知道我已经忘了他了012---...Mike will know l'm over him
因为我闻起来会有另一个男人的味道012---because l'll smell like another guy.
好了012---Okay.
太好了  我在跟俄罗斯计程车司机约会012---Oh, good, l'm dating a Russian cabdriver.
拜托  有人买这个吗012---Seriously, does anyone buy this?
这闻起来像是甜菜012---l smell like beets.
你知道吗012---So, you know what,
我真的很喜欢012---l really like those jackets
那些有垫肩的外套012---with the shoulder pads in them.
你觉得哪里有呢012---Where do you think those would be?
梅兰妮·葛丽芬在《上班女郎》里面穿的012---On Melanie Griffith in Working Girl.
我想你适合穿的在这边012---l think what you want is over here.
我就知道  我需要有人帮我012---See, l told you l needed someone.
对了  为了要谢谢你012---By the way, as a thank you,
我真的很想请你吃饭012---l would really love to take you out.
真的吗012---Really?
是啊012---Yeah!
乔伊跟我012---Actually Joey and I
今晚要去看电影012---are going to the movies tonight,
你想要一起去吗012---wanna come?
我不行012---Oh, l can't.
因为我看过了012---Because l've seen them.
你已经看过所有的电影了012---You've seen all the movies?
是啊  我是铁杆粉丝012---Yeah. l'm a big fan.
电影的012---Of the movies.
移动的画面012---You know, motion pictures.
有声电影012---The talkies.
瑞秋012---Rach,
你可以跟我进去试衣间试穿吗012---will you come with me to a dressing room?
当然012---Sure.
好的012---Okay.
或许我们可以做别的事012---Maybe we could do something else.
你知道的  那要看是什么事012---You know, that depends on what it is.
很多东西我都做过了012---l've done a lot of stuff.
你刚刚是怎么了012---So, what were you doing out there?
你不喜欢查莉吗012---Do you not like Charlie?
她还好啦012---She's okay.
我不知道012---l don't know,
我只是跟她不投缘吧012---l just don't get a really good vibe from her.
为什么012---Why?
我不知道012---l don't know.
你知道的  只是她的一举一动012---You know, just the way
聪明的要命...012---she waltzed in here all smart...
而且又高挑  你知道的...012---...and tall, you know...
让乔伊拜倒在她的石榴裙下012---...and just swept Joey off his feet.
别人都没有机会012---Nobody else has a chance.
还有谁呢012---Who else?
任何人啊012---Anybody.
你  我012---You. Me.
你知道的  莫妮卡的妈012---You know, Monica's mom.
你喜欢乔伊012---You like Joey?!
菲比012---Phoebe!
好吧  你说的没错012---All right, look, l do.
我对他是有一点点感觉  只是...012---l have a little thing for him. Just--
喔  我的天啊012---Oh, my God.
是肉欲的012---lt's just physical.
我已经完全控制住了  好吗012---l have it totally under control, okay?
只是当我看到他们在一起...012---lt's just when l see them together...
有时候  我就会有点忌妒012---...sometimes, l just get a little jealous.
哇  好讽刺喔  他以前喜欢你过012---Wow. lsn't that ironic that he liked you,
然后现在你喜欢…012---and now you like--?
我知道012---l get it!
好吧  一切都控制住就好了012---All right, as long as it's under control.
你不可以采取任何行动012---You can't do anything about it.
他已经跟她在一起了012---He's already dating her.
她是个好人012---She is a nice person.
那是不对的012---That wouldn't be right.
我知道  我知道  所以没事啦012---l know, l know. So it's just not a big deal.
你可以不要说出去吗012---So can we keep this between us?
当然012---Sure.
太好了  因为我得出去了012---Great, because l gotta get out of here.
我快被甜菜味熏死了012---The smell of beets is killing me.
查莉可能会有耳聋的双胞胎妹妹吗012---Any chance Charlie has a deaf twin?
嗨  亲爱的012---Hi, honey.
嘿012---Hey.
我带个朋友回来吃晚餐012---l brought a friend home for dinner.
这是我同事柴克012---This is Zack from work.
当然啦012---Oh, of course.
很高兴再见到你  柴克012---lt's so nice to see you again, Zack.
我也是012---You too.
你们并没有见过面012---You guys haven't actually met before.
天啊  你们还真有礼貌012---But, boy, you're both polite.
请坐  我帮你拿啤酒012---Have a seat. l'll get you a beer.
我来拿012---l got it.
谢谢012---Thanks.
柴克不错吧012---So Zack's pretty nice, huh?
是啊  应该吧012---Yeah, l guess.
那你想不想要生个小孩012---So how would you like to have a baby
一半儿你的  一半儿他的012---that's half yours and half his?
什么012---Excuse me?
我们在讲的是精子捐赠者012---We're talking about sperm donors,
而柴克或许就是适当的人选012---and Zack may be the guy.
他很聪明  健康012---Look. He's intelligent, he's healthy,
体格强壮012---he's athletic.
我是说  他是最佳"精"选了012---l mean, he's sperm-tastic!
钱德勒  这太疯狂了012---Chandler, this is crazy.
你是怎么跟他说的012---Well, what did you even say to him?
"上来看看我老婆012---''Come up. Meet my wife.
给我们你的精子"012---Give us your sperm.''
我邀请他来吃晚餐012---l invited him to dinner
让你有机会了解他012---so you'd get a chance to get to know him.
如果我们去精子银行012---I mean, if we go through with a sperm bank,
我们根本不能见到那个捐赠者012---you never meet the guy,
也查不到他的底细012---get to check him out.
钱德勒012---Chandler!
我告诉你  他非常棒012---l'm telling you, he's great.
我是说  即使我的精子没有问题012---l mean, even if my sperm worked fine,
我也认为我们应该选择他012---l think he'd be the way to go.
这事情我不参加012---l'm not going to be a part of this.
你不能随便带个男的回来012---You can't bring some random guy home
就想让我接受他当精子捐赠者012---and expect him to be our sperm donor.
好吧012---Okay.
柴克012---Zack?
谢谢012---Thanks.
你有杯垫吗012---Do you have a coaster?
我不想在桌上留下印记012---l don't want to make a ring.
跟我说说你的情况  柴克012---Tell me about yourself, Zack.
天啊  你觉得她听到了吗012---Oh, God, do you think she heard?
如果她听到就惨了012---lt'd be so bad if she heard.
或许她没有听到012---Maybe she didn't hear.
我到隔壁间说话012---l'll go into that dressing room and talk.
你待在这里012---You stay in here.
看看你是不是可以听到我说话012---and I'll talk and see if you can hear me.
好的012---Okay, great.
噢  感谢上帝012---Oh, thank God,
我听不到你说话012---l can't hear a word that you're saying.
我还没有开始说话012---l didn't say anything yet.
那回去里面然后说话啊012---Well, get back in there and talk.
我是瑞秋012---l'm Rachel.
让艾玛在电话上012---lt's so annoying
跟我朋友讲话012---when l put Emma on the phone
真的很讨厌012---to talk with my friends.
什么012---What?
有些事是很难012---Well, some things are just hard
当你的面说的012---to say to your face.
好吧  我听到了012---Okay, well, l heard that.
表示她也听到了012---Which means that she heard it too.
我们有麻烦了012---We have a problem.
我们该怎么办呢012---Oh, what are we gonna do?
就老实跟她说吧012---Just be honest with her.
噢  我的天啊012---Oh, my God!
父母让婴儿听电话012---And it is annoying when parents
的确是很讨厌012---put their baby on the phone...
好了  你说够了012---All right, enough out of you!
喂012---Hello?
我要跟查莉讲话012---l need to talk to Charlie.
她在吗012---ls she there?
不在  她跟瑞秋去逛街了012---No, she went shopping with Rachel.
找她干嘛  怎么了012---Why? What's up?
我正在跟薛曼教授012---l'm meeting with Professor Sherman
讨论关于我当主讲人的事012---about my being the keynote speaker.
进行的如何呢012---How's it going?
可以更顺利的012---lt could be better.
他睡着了012---He fell asleep.
什么  但是我已经012---What? But l already bought
订了到百慕大的机票了012---my ticket to Bermuda!
是巴巴多斯012---Barbados.
好啦  我再租车开过去012---Fine, l'll rent a car and drive.
你一定要得到这工作012---You have to get that job.
我应该怎么办呢012---What am l supposed to do?
他完全睡着了012---He's out cold.
事实上012---ln fact,
刚刚他还在说梦话012---he was just talking in his sleep before...
而且他还要一个叫法兰的人012---...and evidently he wants someone named Fran
"再打大力点"012---to ''spank him harder.''
那叫醒他吧012---Well, just wake him up.
不可以012---l can't.
如果他发现我是让他睡着的人012---lf he realizes that l'm the one
我就得不到这个工作了012---who put him to sleep, l won't get the job.
那倒是挺难的012---That's a tough one.
等等012---Oh, wait a minute.
这以前也发生在我身上过012---This happened to me before.
是啊  我之前在试演一出戏剧的时候012---Yeah, l was auditioning for a play,
那个制作人睡着了  我...012---and the producer fell asleep. l--
不  等等012---No, wait a minute.
其实是我睡着了012---lt was me who fell asleep.
我是说  莎士比亚012---l mean, hey, Shakespeare,
来点动作场面吧012---how about a chase scene once in a while?
嘿  晚餐好了012---Hey, guys, dinner's ready.
我先去洗手012---l'm gonna go wash up first.
谢了012---Thanks.
你觉得呢012---What do you think?
我要我的孩子有他的基因012---l want his genes for my kid.
那双眼睛  那颧骨012---Those eyes, those cheekbones.

麦克跟我分手了012---Mike and l broke up.
你在开玩笑吧012---You're kidding me.
因为我没有在跟谁交往012---Because l'm not seeing anybody.
我完全是编出来的012---l just totally made that up.
真的吗012---Really?
我不知道为什么瞎编012---l don't know why,
我很抱歉012---l'm sorry.

我现在要走了012---l'm gonna take off now.
你们会让我回家吗012---You're gonna let me go home, aren't you?

不了  我应该要回家了012---No, l should get home.
我有点累012---l'm kind of tired.
你是刚感觉累吗012---Are you just tired now?
还是一直都感觉累012---Or are you always tired?
因为这很有可能是012---Because that could be
忧郁症的前兆012---a sign of clinical depression.
不  只是要想出我祖父母012---No, it's tiring to figure out the age at
是几岁过世的让我很累012---which all my grandparents died.
明天见012---l'll see you tomorrow.
好的012---Okay.
再见012---Bye.
我想我们找到我们的精子了012---l think we found our sperm.
他看起来是挺完美的012---He does seem pretty perfect.
你也这么认为吗012---Yeah? You think so?
我要开口问他吗012---Should l ask him?
不要012---No.
为什么呢012---Why not?
就只因为012---Just because his
他曾祖母有肥胖症吗012---great-grandmother was obese?
反正我们的孩子也是会从你那遗传到的012---Our kid's gonna get that from you anyway.
不  不是那个原因012---No, that's not it.
只是在我们问他012---lt's just that when we were asking him
那些问题时…012---all those questions before...
我意识到我并不在乎012---...l just realized l don't care
他是不是世上最完美的男人012---if he is the most perfect guy in the world.
他不是你012---He's not you.
是啊  他比我更好012---Yeah, he's better!
不  他不是012---No, he's not.
如果我不能跟你怀孕012---lf l can't get pregnant with you,
我也不想跟他...012---then l don't want to get pregnant by him...
或是跟任何人012---...or anyone else.
真的  你确定吗012---Really? Are you sure?
是的  我确定012---Yeah, l'm sure.
感谢上帝012---Thank God,
因为我也不想这样做012---because l don't wanna do this either.
我会这样做012---l was just doing it
是因为我以为你想这样012---because l thought that was what you wanted.
我是丈夫012---You know, l'm the husband.
我理当要提供精子的012---l'm supposed to bring the sperm.
这实在是很体贴012---That is so sweet.
我爱你012---l love you.
所以你知道我们唯一的选择就只剩...012---So you know this leaves us with....
领养012---Adoption.
你觉得如何呢012---How do you feel about that?
我想我没问题012---l think l feel okay about it.
事实上我觉得非常的好012---Actually, l think l feel really good about it.
我也是012---Me too.
我想找到一个需要家庭温暖的小孩012---l wanna find a baby that needs a home,
然后跟你一起抚养他012---and l wanna raise it with you.
然后我想用我们012---And l wanna mess it up
自己的方式来乱养他012---in our own specific way.
我们就这么决定了012---So this is it?
我们真的要领养012---We're really gonna adopt?
是的012---Yeah.
我的天  我们要当父母亲了012---Oh, my God! We're gonna be parents!
我们会是很棒的父母012---We are gonna be great parents.
而且可能会很快012---And it could be soon.
我是说  想想看012---l mean, think about it.
就是现在  在外面某个地方...012---Right now, somewhere out there...
我们的孩子可能正被受孕012---...our baby could be being conceived.
等等  如果我们够幸运012---Wait. lf we're lucky,
而且我们真的  真的  真的很安静…012---and we're really, really, really quiet...
我们或许可以听到012---...we may be able to hear
保险套破裂的声音012---the sound of a condom breaking.
嘿  柴克012---Hey, Zack.
嘿  钱德勒012---Hey, Chandler.

我感到我们让你很不舒服012---l got the feeling we made you a little uncomfortable.
不  并没有012---No, you didn't.
真的吗012---Really?
没错  你们是有012---No, you did.
我老婆跟我越界了012---My wife and l have some boundary issues.
有时候我们会问些很不适当的问题012---Sometimes we ask inappropriate questions.

你知不知道珍娜012---You wouldn't know if Jeanette's planning on
