不会出错了吧012---Can this be right?
就是嘛  天啊012---I know. God,
除了我小时候  双层夹心饼上市那会012---I haven't seen my savings take a hit like this...
我的存款就没这么少过012---since I was a kid and they came up with Double Stuf Oreos.
我们的存款哪去了呢012---What happened to all of our money?
我不清楚他们做了什么012---I'm not sure exactly what they did...
但是我倾向于责怪安然公司倒闭案012---but I'm inclined to blame Enron.
大概因为你在做实习工012---I guess with you doing the internship,
所以我们有些入不敷出012---we're spending more than we're bringing in.
是啊  或许我应该辞掉012---Yeah, maybe I should quit
找个有薪水的工作012---and get a job that pays.
可你总算找到你喜欢的工作了012---But you're finally doing something that you love.
我不能要求你放弃的012---I mean, I can't ask you to give that up.
不过你喜欢做的工作是挖金子012---Although it would be nice if the thing that you loved
那就好了012---was finding gold.
我觉得我们太小题大作了012---You know, I think we're making too big a deal out of this.
我们这个月迟些付账单012---We'll pay our bills late this month.
下个月我们就节省一些开销012---Next month we'll cut back on a few things.
而且或许我们可以变换一下012---And maybe we start eating out of Joey's refrigerator
到乔伊家的冰箱找食物012---for a change.
你是大厨012---You're a chef.
用苏打粉跟啤酒你会做什么菜012---What can you make out of baking soda and beer?
最糟糕的情况下012---Worst-case scenario is,
我们只好找我父母借钱012---we borrow some money from my parents.
不可以  而且我们也不借钱012---No, and we're not borrowing money.
-为什么   -我们是宾家人012---- Why not? -We don't do that.
宾家人从不跟人借钱012---We are Bings.
我爸唯一教会我的事  就是012---If there's one thing my father taught me, it was...
去别人家泳池之前012---well, to always knock
一定要先敲门012---before going into the pool house.
还有  永远都不要向人借钱012---The other thing is, never borrow money.
我不知道你这么有自尊012---I had no idea you had this much pride.
没错  我有  我是你男人012---That's right, I do. I am your man.
我会让我们度过难关的012---I'm gonna get us through this situation...
就算你要加倍努力地工作012---even if it means you working twice as hard.

而且我需要多拿几件衣服012---and I need to get more clothes.
你不用回去012---You don't have to go.
我有衣服可以给你穿012---I have something that'll fit you.
我穿女生的紧身衣  是在逗你012---I put that tube top on as a joke.
我想要你留下来012---I want you to stay.
我也想要留下来012---I want to stay too.
但是这几条内裤我都穿遍了012---But I've got as much use out of these boxers as I can.
-要不反过来再穿呢  -已经反过了012---- Why don't you turn them inside  - Done it.
我几个小时之后就回来012---I'll be back in a couple of hours.
好吧  我会想你的012---All right. I'll miss you.
我也是012---Me too.

我不想回家012---I don't want to go home.
太好了  好的  我去拿紧身衣012---Great! Okay, I'll go get the tube top.
不  我的意思是012---No, no, what I mean is...
我不喜欢回去自己的公寓里012---I hate going back to my apartment now.
一方面是因为  我住的房间又小又乱012---Partly because I live above a known crack den...
但是  主要是因为012---...but, you know, mostly because when I'm there,
我回去的时候  真的好想你012---I really miss you.
所以...012---So...
我们同居好不好012---do you want to move in together?
哇  迈克·汉尼根012---Wow, Mike Hanigan...
你倒真有两把刷子  让女生说"好耶"012---...you sure know how to make a girl say ''Hell, yeah.''

好啊  就这样  让我们住在一起012---Yeah, let's do it. Let's live together.
我们真的要同居了吗012---We're really gonna move in together?
是啊012---Yeah.
我一直都想要跟男生同居012---I've always wanted to live with a guy.
袜子捡起来012---Pick up your socks.

一会我要拜托你的事情012---I'm about to ask you...
你永远都不会告诉钱德勒012---will never get back to Chandler.
如果说我  没有想过那件事012---I'd be lying if I said I hadn't
那是骗你的012---thought about it myself.
但是钱德勒是我最好的朋友012---But Chandler is my best friend.
那是不对的012---It would be wrong.
感觉应该不错  却是不对的012---Good, but wrong.
好的  首先  感觉会是棒翻天012---Okay, first of all, it would be great.
但那不是我说的事  我要跟你借钱012---But that's not what I'm here to talk to you about. I need to borrow money.
哦  不好说  莫妮卡  你知道012---Oh, I don't know, Monica. You know
借钱给朋友不是什么好事012---lending friends money is always a mistake.
但是钱德勒借过你钱啊012---But Chandler lent you money.
而他也会告诉你  那不是什么好事012---And he would tell you it was a mistake.
别这样  我只是...012---Come on, I just....
需要付房租跟一些帐单012---I need it for some rent and some other bills.
多少钱呢012---Well, how much?
两千块012---Two thousand dollars?
两千块012---Two thousand dollars?
你以为我是谁  肥皂剧明星吗012---What do you think I am, a soap opera star?
-是啊  -没错  我就是012---- Yeah.  - That's right, I am.

艾玛已经开始会爬了012---You know how Emma started crawling?
我觉得这个地方  对婴儿很不安全012---I realized that this place is very unsafe for a baby...
所以我去店里买了些东西012---...so I went to the store
可以保护婴儿在公寓里活动012---and I got some stuff to baby-proof the apartment.
哦  天啊  保护婴儿012---Oh, God, baby-proofing.
有什么了不起的012---Why is it such a big deal now?
我小的时候  经常发生012---You know, when I was a kid, it was like:
"哎呀  乔伊跌下楼梯了"012---''Whoops, Joey fell down the stairs.''
或者  "糟糕  乔伊又电到自己了"012---Or, ''Whoops, Joey electrocuted himself again.''
你要找人帮忙装这些东西吗012---Anyway, are you going to get a handyman to install this stuff?
不  我自己来就行了012---No, I was just gonna do it myself.
-你要自己来  -是啊  不行吗012---- You're gonna do it?  - Yeah. Why?
你觉得女人做不来吗012---You don't think a woman can do this?
女人可以  你不行012---Women can. You can't.
莫妮卡  请你告诉乔伊  他是猪012---Monica, will you please tell Joey that he is a pig.
你是猪  而你做不来012---You're a pig. And you can't do this.
什么012---What?
别这样  我自己都找到五金店了012---What? Come on, I found the hardware store all by myself.
五金店不就在街角嘛012---The store's right down the street.
街角就有五金店啊012---There is a hardware store right down the street?
嘿  各位  我们有好消息要宣布012---Hey, you guys? Okay, we've got great news.
菲比跟我要搬到一起了012---Phoebe and I are moving in together.
恭喜012---Congratulations.
好兴奋  我从来都没跟男生同居过012---I know, it's so exciting. You know, I've never lived with a guy before.
其实跟女生同居是一样的012---Well, it's just like living with a girl,
只是他们不会偷用你的化妆品012---only they don't steal your makeup.
除非他们扮演012---Unless they're playing
"我要有妹妹  她长什么样"012---''This Is What My Sister Would Look Like.''

我们才没有那样012---We don't do that.
告诉她  我们没有012---Tell her we don't do that.
是的  亲爱的012---Yes, dear.
不敢相信你们要同居了012---I can't believe you're moving in together.
真替你们高兴012---I'm happy for you guys.

莫妮卡  别急好吗012---Monica, slow down, okay?
我只是很兴奋要跟他同居了而已012---I'm just excited to be living with him.
你知道的  我是说  我不知道...012---You know, I mean, I don't know...
我能预见  有天跟迈克结婚吗012---...can I see someday being married to Mike?
是的  当然012---Sure. Yeah.
我可以想像012---I could picture myself
穿着婚纱走在红毯上012---walking down the aisle in a wedding dress...
婚纱主要突显我的胸部012---.that highlights my breasts
但是是很高雅的爆乳012---in an obvious yet classy way.
但问我想不想要012---But do I want
在康乃狄克州的好学区附近012---that house in Connecticut near

迈克可以和我012---...where Mike and I could
送我们的小苏菲  跟小迈克去上学012---send little Sophie and Mike Jr.?
哦  我的天  我愿意012---Oh, my God, I do.
我不晓得你是这么传统的人012---I had no idea you were so conventional.
我也没想到  大概我是的012---I know. I guess I am.
我的天  开着沃尔沃012---Oh, my God, load up the Volvo,
我就是中产阶级妇女了012---I want to be a soccer mom.
你准备好要走了吗012---You ready to go?
当然好了  新室友012---Yeah, you bet, roomie.
你是说"新郎"吧012---Don't you mean ''groomie''?
-你们在说什么  -拜托012---- What are you talking about?  - Please.
这些家伙  我们都还没一起住012---These guys. We haven't even moved in yet,
他们就要我们选结婚用的瓷器了012---and they have us picking out china patterns.
结婚用的瓷器012---China patterns!
很容易嘛  还说"你不行..."012---This is easy. ''Can't do this....''
哇  还真的咧  就是不行012---Wow, seriously. Can't do this.
-嘿  乔伊  -嘿012---- Hey, Joe.  - Hey.
听着  我需要你帮个忙012---Look, I need to ask you a favor,
而且不能跟莫妮卡说012---and we can't tell Monica anything about it.
我以为你们之间没有秘密012---I thought you guys didn't have secrets.
官方说法上是那样没错012---That will remain the official party line.
莫妮卡跟我  有一点点经济上的问题012---Look, Monica and I are having a little financial trouble.
是啊  我知道012---Yeah, I know.
什么  你怎么知道的012---What? How do you know?
我猜的  你知道的012---I just figured it out, you know?
你没有工作  而且现在经济又很萧条012---I mean, you're not working, and the economy is bad.
哦  对012---Oh, right.
这是我反应最快的一次了012---That is the fastest I have ever thought.
反正...012---Anyway...
我需要跟你借点钱012---I need to borrow some money.
当然可以  多少钱  两千块吗012---Oh, sure. Yeah, how much? Two thousand dollars?
是的  正是两千块012---Yes, $2000 exactly.
你是怎么知道的012---How did you know that?
我知道你之前赚多少钱012---I know how much you used to make,
而且我也知道你们的房租012---and I know how much your rent is.
哦  好的012---Oh, okay.
我真是天才012---I am on fire.
听着  你真好012---Listen, this is really nice.
你是不是开了一张012---Did you write a check
两千块的支票给莫妮卡012---to Monica for $2000?
莫妮卡跟你借钱了012---Did Monica borrow money from you?
好像是012---Kind of.
我不敢相信她竟然这样做012---I can't believe her.
她跟你说我们经济出问题了吗012---Did she tell you we were having money problems?
不  不是为了你们的经济问题012---No, no, no. It wasn't because of your money problems.
是她自己的东西012---It was for something for her.
什么012---What?
很私人的东西012---Something personal.
她要买两千块的东西012---What would she get for $2000
还不能告诉我012---that she wouldn't tell me about?
打扰一下012---Excuse me.
隆乳手术012---Boob job.
隆乳手术  她根本不需要啊012---A boob job? She doesn't need that.
太疯狂了012---That's crazy.
不算太疯狂  好吗012---Well, it's not that crazy, okay?
把咪咪变小才叫做疯狂012---Making them smaller, that would be crazy.
嘿  我想要问你012---Oh, hey, I wanted to ask you about
关于莫妮卡"新郎"的玩笑012---Monica's little ''groomie'' joke.
我想大家会笑012---Well, I think the reason people laughed is
是因为"新室友"和"新郎"音近012---that it's a play on the word ''roomie.''
我听得懂这个笑话  真是高深啊012---I get the joke. Sophisticated as it was.
不  我要说的是...012---No, the thing I want to say is....
或许我们之前就应该先谈过012---Maybe we should've talked about this before.
我们同居之后012---Us living together,
你没有期望我会求婚吧012---you're not expecting a proposal, right?
-哦  不  一点也没有  -好的012---- Oh, no, no. Not at all.  - Okay.
我们才刚搬进来一起住012---We're just moving in right now.
将来怎样顺其自然012---We'll see where it goes.
对  这就是个问题012---Yeah, well, that's the thing.
对我而言  这已经是我的极限了012---For me, it's as far as it can ever go.
你是什么意思012---What do you mean?
听着  菲比  我...012---Look, Phoebe, I....
我非常爱你  但我不想再结婚了012---I love you very much. But I never want to get married again.
只是我的第一次婚姻太...012---It's just, my first marriage was...
太糟糕了  我已经对婚姻失去信心了012---you know, such a disaster that I kind of lost faith in the whole idea.
有那么糟吗012---Was it that bad?
到最后...有一次012---At one point, near the end...
她故意便便在我的...012---she deliberately defecated on my
哦  那真糟012---Okay, well, that's bad. Yeah.
但你不认为012---But don't you think it might be different
换个人会不一样吗012---with someone else? Perhaps...
或许是一个012---a blond
会在厕所便便的金发女郎012---who always uses the toilet?
除了便在海里的那次012---Except for once in the ocean.
听着  不是结婚对象是谁的问题012---Look, it's not about who I would marry.
我第一次结婚的时候012---I was certain the first time I got married
我坚信会白头到老  但我错了012---it'd last forever. I was wrong.
但是  只是012---But, it just
菲比  问题不在你012---Look, Phoebe, it's not about you.
我只是再也不想结婚了012---I just never want to get married again.
我很抱歉012---I'm sorry.
你介意吗  如果你介意的话012---Are you okay with that? If not,
或许我们同居  不是个好主意012---maybe us moving in together isn't the best idea.
可以  哦  我当然不想结婚012---No. Oh, I definitely don't want to get married.
我只想确定你也不想结婚012---I just wanted to make sure you didn't want to, too.
因为如果我们住在一起了012---Because if we move in
你再开始改变主意...012---and you start changing your mind...
我们就有麻烦了  先生012---...there is gonna be hell to pay, mister.
相信我  我永远不...012---Trust me. I will never
好的  我知道了012---Yeah, I get that. Yeah.
嗨  最后你决定请人来帮忙了012---Hi. So you gave in and decided to call someone?
是啊  不知道我当时在想什么012---Yeah. I don't know who I was kidding.
我连筷子都不会用012---I can barely use chopsticks.
-都装好了  -非常感谢012---- You're all set.  - Oh, thank you so much.
等等  你忘了你的...012---Wait. You forgot your...
玩具012---...game.
谢谢你012---Thank you.
嘿  瑞秋012---Hey, Rach.
我身材完美的老婆在这呢012---There she is, my perfectly proportioned wife.
别看我  我从来没有听懂过他的笑话012---Don't look at me. I never get his jokes.
-谢谢你  -不  不  别谢我012---- Thank you?   -No, no. Don't thank me.
谢谢你  你知道吗012---Thank you. Do you know
我希望你不要改变任何一点012---there is not one thing I would change about you?
一点都不要变  而且特别是...012---Not one single thing. And definitely not...
那两点012---two single things.
好的  你真的很怪012---Okay, you're being weird.
你想上床吗  还是做了什么错事012---Do you want sex, or did you do something bad?
不  我就是爱你这模样  我爱你的012---No. No. No. I just love the way you look. I am warm
身材012---for your form.
传统上  一般都是说 "你很漂亮"012---Okay, you know the old classics like, you know, ''You look nice''?
这句话还适用012---They're still okay.
但是"你很漂亮"可能只是代表012---But ''you look nice'' could mean that I'm saying,
"你的脸蛋看起来漂亮"012---''Your face looks nice.''
我想要赞美你的身体012---I want to compliment your body.
我是说  我一点都不想它改变012---I mean, I wouldn't change it at all.
而且更详细地说  就是012---And more specifically,
我不想让任何部位变大012---I wouldn't want anything to get any bigger.
-好的  -我是说...012---- Okay.  - I mean...
你也不会想要我身体的某部份变大012---...you wouldn't want any part of me to get any bigger,
不是吗012---would you?
此题不用回答012---Don't answer that.
我还以为那老兄不可能更怪了012---Just when you thought that dude couldn't get any weirder.
你觉得他  为什么要担心我会变大012---Why do you think he was so worried about me getting bigger?
我不知道  这事儿从何而起啊012---I don't know. I mean, what brought that on?
我的天  我们正努力要怀孕...012---Oh, my God. You know what, we're trying to get pregnant...
所以他可能  很怕我的身材会变形012---...so he's probably starting to freak out that my body's gonna change.
你认为是这样吗012---You think that's what it is?
你也听到了012---You heard him.
"不要变大  你很完美了012---''No bigger. You're perfect.
不要再变大了"012---Just don't get any bigger.''
天啊  他听起来就像是012---My God, he sounded just like
我高中的摔角教练012---my high-school wrestling coach.
我必须要跟钱德勒谈谈012---I'm gonna have to talk to Chandler.
是啊  如果你不去  我去012---Yeah. If you don't, I will.
你的身材必然会走样012---Of course your body's gonna change.
你的胸部会变大012---Your breasts are gonna get bigger...
你的屁股会变大012---...your ass is gonna get bigger...
你的膀胱会失控012---.you're gonna lose bladder control.
我的天  真是奇妙的过程啊012---God, it's just such a magical time.
听着  我想向你请教关于婚姻的事012---Hi. Listen, I wanted to ask you something about marriage.
太好了  现在你是跑来取笑我吗012---Oh, great. Now you're seeking me out to make jokes?
大家在一起的时候被取笑012---I mean, I can see
我可以理解012---if we're all hanging out,
但是跑到我家来...012---but to come to my home....
不  我真的想知道你的意见012---No, I really want to know how you feel about it.
为什么012---Why?
迈克永远不想要结婚012---Mike doesn't ever want to get married.
-永远吗   -永远012---- Never? - Never.
哇  你还要跟他同居吗012---Wow. Are you still gonna move in with him?
我想啊  但是我要你告诉我012---I want to, but I wanted you to tell me
结婚真的没什么大不了012---that marriage really isn't that big a deal.
没结婚也不必后悔012---You know, that I won't be missing out on anything.
因为婚姻烂毙了012---That marriage stinks.
是啊  婚姻烂毙了012---Yeah, marriage stinks.
如果你想看到012---I mean, if you want to see
男人变肥  女人不再除毛012---a man gain weight and a woman stop shaving
就叫他们结婚吧012---get them married.
那不是你真正的感觉  对吧012---That's not how you really feel, is it?
不是  我很抱歉012---No, I'm sorry.
我知道这不是你想听到的话012---I know it's not what you want to hear,
但是我没有办法说谎  我喜欢结婚012---but I can't help it. I love marriage.
真的吗  你这个"离婚专家"012---Seriously, you? ''Divorce-o''?
如果你要帮我取绰号012---If you have to call me a name,
我比较喜欢   "罗斯  离婚王"012---I'd prefer ''Ross, the Divorcer.''
听起来较酷012---It's just cooler.

你很沉醉于当中产阶级妇女什么的012---you were all caught up in the whole soccer-mom thing...
但是那是真的你吗012---...but is that really you?

有时候你的话真伤人012---You know, sometimes your words, they hurt.
嘿  你们要把这个放哪呢012---Hey, where do you guys want this?

该轮到我拥有正常的东西了012---to have some of the regular stuff.
你为什么不早说呢012---Why didn't you say something before?
我之前不确定我有多想要012---I didn't know how much I wanted it.

我也想跟你一起住  我们就搬到一起吧012---I want to live with you too. I mean, let's do that.
但是我做不到012---But I don't think I can.
当我不清楚未来会怎样时012---It was okay to move in
是可以搬到一起012---when I didn't know what was gonna happen.
但已经知道是毫无未来了012---But I can't move in knowing nothing is
我做不到012---ever gonna happen.

至少你可以远离那张丑椅子了012---At least you won't have to live with this ugly chair.
