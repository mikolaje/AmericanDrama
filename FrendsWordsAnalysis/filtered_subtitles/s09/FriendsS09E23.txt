我也应该走了012---l should go too.
明天你们要一起搭计程车到机场吗012---Now, tomorrow do you guys want to share a cab to the airport...
难忘往日情怀脱口而出吗012---That's a blast from the past, huh?
不  没关系的  无心之过012---No, it's okay. Honest mistake.
那真的不代表什么012---lt really doesn't mean anything.
我是说  你知道的...012---l mean, you know...
莫妮卡也常常012---...Monica refers to Chandler
把钱德勒叫理查德012---as Richard all the time.
她有吗012---She does?
你快给我走吧012---Let's get you out of here.
至少你也拖我下水了012---Well, at least you took me down with you.
我很抱歉012---l'm so sorry.
我只是...  我一直在想迈克012---l just-- l keep thinking about Mike.
我非常喜欢大卫012---l'm crazy about David,
而且我们在一起很开心012---and we're having so much fun together.

是钱德勒012---Chandler.
你对钱德勒的感觉012---Your feelings for Chandler
都已经消失了012---are certainly gone.
天啊  菲比还在想迈克吗012---Boy, Phoebe's still pretty hung up on that Mike, huh?
我不会想太多的012---l wouldn't read too much into it.
但是女生把你叫成012---Still, a girl calls you
她前男友的名字...012---by her ex-boyfriend's name...
那不是什么好事  不是吗012---...that's not a good thing, right?
大卫  让我先打断你一下012---David, let me stop you there.
因为我想我知道这是怎么回事了012---Because l think l see where this is going.
我对给人建议不太行012---l'm not very good at giving advice.
如果你想得到建议012---See, if you want advice,
去找罗斯或者莫妮卡012---go to Ross or Monica. Or Joey...
如果你想知道披萨的馅料或是012---...for advice about pizza toppings
为何尿尿时有灼热感之类的...  就找乔伊012---or a burning sensation when you pee.
很抱歉012---l'm sorry,
我只是希望能做点什么012---l just wish there was something l could do,
你知道吗012---you know?
嗯  你知道菲比...012---Well, you know Phoebe--
真的  我们要这样吗012---Seriously, we're gonna do this?
很抱歉012---l'm sorry,
我只希望我能012---l just wish l could make her
让她忘了迈克012---forget about Mike already.
菲比跟迈克为什么分手呢012---Why did Phoebe and Mike break up?
因为他的鸡鸡太大了012---Because his penis was too big.
抱歉  那才是我擅长的事012---l'm sorry. That's the kind of thing l do.
他们分手是012---They broke up because
因为迈克不想要结婚012---Mike didn't want to get married.
如果让菲比知道012---What if you let Phoebe know
你对婚姻没有异议呢012---you'd be open to marriage?
太棒了  太棒了  我会跟她求婚012---That's great. That's great. l'll propose to her.
什么012---What?
反正我迟早都会这么做的012---l was probably going to do it at some point.
不  我没有说现在012---No, l didn't mean now.
为何不呢  这主意太好了012---Well, why not? lt's brilliant.
再见  迈克012---''Goodbye, Mike.

衷心地谢谢你  钱德勒012---Well, thank you, Chandler. Sincerely.
你不用客气012---Well, you're welcome.

你认为我该怎么求婚呢012---How do you think l should propose?

你好吗012---Yeah. How you doing?
嘿  你好吗012---Hey, how are you?
你说你要穿丁字裤的012---You said you were gonna wear a thong.
丁字裤呢012---Where's the thong?
我不是说丁字裤012---l didn't mean a thong.
我是说夹脚凉鞋012---l meant thongs.
你应该要说清楚的012---You really should have been more clear about that.
你们不会相信012---You're never gonna guess
我在楼下看到谁012---who l just saw downstairs.
小甜甜布莱尼012---Britney Spears!
是啊  她从来不会错过012---Yeah. She never misses

你可以说012---You could say,
"嗨  肯尼012---''Hey, Kenny,
为什么你不是小甜甜布莱尼呢  "012---how come you're not Britney Spears?''
你准备好要走了吗012---You ready to go?
你现在就要走了吗012---You're gonna go now?
我以为我们可以在一起坐会闲聊呢012---l thought we could hang out.
我不行  我整天都有研讨会012---l can't. l have seminars all day.
我答应罗斯我会看看他的演说稿012---l promised Ross l'd look at his speech.
但是或许我们晚点可以用进晚餐012---But maybe we could have dinner later?
在阳台外面012---Out on the balcony?
会很浪漫的012---lt'll be romantic.
你可以穿丁字裤吗012---Will you wear a thong?
你穿我就穿012---l will if you will.
你谈成了一笔奇怪的交易012---You got yourself a very weird deal.

没有  为什么呢012---No. Why?
天啊012---Oh, man.
这里有室内游泳池012---There's an indoor pool.
你可以在那边游泳012---You could swim there.
是啊012---Yeah.
我没有要游泳  我是要去挖洞的012---l wasn't gonna swim. l was gonna dig a hole.
迈克那件事真是有趣012---That Mike thing was interesting.
我不知道...012---l don't know what's gonna happen...
菲比跟大卫之间会发生什么事012---...with Phoebe and David.
我知道  想要个提示吗012---l do. Want a hint, huh?
我知道（我愿意）012---l do.
我知道012---l do.
好的  我可以感到012---Okay, l'm sensing this is
这是什么文字游戏的012---some kind of wordplay...
因为你已经有点012---...because you are pink
无法控制的兴奋发红了012---with barely controlled glee.
大卫要跟菲比求婚了012---David's gonna propose to Phoebe.
什么  为什么012---What? Why?
因为我们本来在谈012---Because we were talking about ways
有哪些他可以赢过迈克的方式012---he could beat Mike...
而我告诉他012---...and l told him Phoebe
菲比想要结婚012---wanted to get married.
钱德勒  我们已经谈过了012---Chandler, we have talked about this.
你不可以给别人建议的012---You are not supposed to give people advice!
你不能说一些什么不适宜的笑话就好了吗012---Couldn't you have made some inappropriate joke?
我说了012---l did!
一个鸡鸡的笑话012---A penis one!
说明一下012---Just so l know,
我说的有什么不对的呢012---what was so wrong about what l said?
他们才交往几个星期而已012---They've only been going out for a few weeks.
菲比还无法忘记迈克012---Phoebe is completely hung up on Mike.
我想她会拒绝的012---l mean, she'll say no...
然后大卫会心碎012---...David's heart will be broken,
他们会很难复合012---it'll be too hard for them to recover...
菲比最后又落得孤零零一个人012---...and then Phoebe will end up alone again.
天啊  真是糟糕的建议012---Man, that's some bad advice.
感谢上帝你们来了012---Oh, hey. Thank God. You guys are here.
怎么了012---What's going on?
这里的一切都不对劲012---Everything is upside-down here.
整天都在下雨  没有人看电视012---lt rains all day long and nobody watches TV,
而且罗斯还很有名气012---and Ross is famous.
我不想要惊动大家...012---l don't want to alarm anybody...
但是莫妮卡的头发012---...but Monica's hair is twice as big as it was
比下飞机时大了一倍012---when we landed.
好了  当我去高湿度地区的时候...012---Okay. When l go places with high humidity...
头发就会比较蓬松  好吗012---...it gets a little extra body, okay?
那就是为什么我们的蜜月照012---That's why our honeymoon photos

我带你们去登记入驻012---l'll show you guys where to check in.
亲爱的012---Oh, honey?
一定要弄张超大尺寸的床012---Can you make sure we get a king-size bed?
大卫  也帮我们弄一张012---Oh, David, get one for us too. Oh,
还有看看他们有没有心型的床012---and see if they have a heart-shaped one.
天花板上要有镜子012---And with mirrors on the ceiling.
还有确定我们的房间012---And make sure our room
不要在他们的隔壁012---isn't next to theirs.
喔  你们真幸运012---Oh, you guys are so lucky
有人陪你们到这里012---you're here with people.
这是个很浪漫的地方012---You know, it's just such a romantic place.
我只希望可以跟一个男人共度012---l just wish l could share it with a guy.
不是乔伊012---Not Joey.
不是乔伊  不是012---Not Joey. No.
我只是在垂涎钱德勒012---l was just lusting after Chandler.

是啊  一个失败的科学家012---Yes, well, being a failed scientist
并没有你想的赚的多012---doesn't pay quite as well as you might think.
那是七十分之一克拉012---That's one-seventieth of a carat.
而且透明度非常差012---And the clarity is quite poor.
很好012---Nice.
莫妮卡  我可以跟你谈一下吗012---Monica, can l talk to you for a second?
好的012---Okay.
大卫要在今晚跟菲比求婚012---David's gonna propose to Phoebe tonight.
瞧瞧这就是012---See what happens
你给别人建议的后果012---when you give people advice?
我希望你有告诉他不可以012---Well, l hope you told him not to.
那又会是一个建议了012---That would be advice!
好的  没关系  让我来处理012---Okay, fine. l'll handle this.
菲比012---Phoebe?
怎样012---Yeah?

让我们把他塞住嘴巴铐起他来012---Let's just gag him and handcuff him...
然后逼他踏上红毯  好吗012---...and force him down the aisle, okay?
我已经可以预见到012---l can just see it.
"迈克  你愿意娶菲比吗  "012---''Mike, do you take Phoebe?''
你知道吗  真是每个女孩的梦想012---You know? lt's every girl's dream.
你真的认为012---Do you really think
嫁给别人是对的012---marrying someone else is the right answer?
当然  听着  最重要的是012---Sure. Look, okay, bottom line?
我爱迈克...大卫012---l love Mike-- David!

我工作的电脑012---You know, this happens all the time
也常常发生这种事012---to my computer at work.
那你怎么办呢012---What do you do?
我通常会...012---l usually go...
到别人的电脑上玩俄罗斯方块012---...play Tetris on somebody else's computer.
我不敢相信发生这种事012---l can't believe this is happening.

我要说什么呢012---What am l gonna say?
你可以用我背下来012---You can use a speech
参加试镜的那段话012---l memorized for auditions.
我不认为你在《星际大战》里的独白012---l don't think your monologue from Star Wars
可以对我有所帮助012---is gonna help me right now.
罗斯  不会有问题的012---Ross, we can solve this.
我听过你的演讲012---l just heard your speech.
我们可以重新写出来012---We can re-create it.
我们有一整晚012---We've got all night.

等等012---Oh, wait.
乔伊跟我应该要共进晚餐的012---Joey and l are supposed to have dinner.
别担心晚餐了012---Don't worry about that.
我知道罗斯需要你012---l mean, Ross needs you.
瑞秋跟我会留下来尽量帮忙012---Rachel and l will stay and help any way we can.
好的  我们来开始吧012---All right. Okay, let's do it.
我知道我们一开始012---Well, l know we start by
是讨论碳年代测定法的缺点012---discussing the shortcomings of carbon dating.
然后我接着解说012---And then l move on to
很明显地什么是...012---what is clearly the defining moment...
中生代的决定时刻012---...of the Mesozoic Era,
原始大陆的分裂  不是吗012---the breakup of Pangaea. Hello?
然后接下来是三叠纪的概观012---And then there's the overview of the Triassic.
有可能这一切都是在012---Any chance any of this happened
很远的银河发生的吗012---in a galaxy far, far away?
哈啰012---Hello?
好了  迈克012---Okay, Mike?
闹够了012---Enough is enough.
你爱菲比  而她也爱你012---You love Phoebe, and she loves you.
所以不要再说什么012---So get over your
不想要结婚的话了012---l-never-wanna-get-married thing...
赶快站出来012---...and step up!
你是谁012---Who is this?
我是莫妮卡  菲比的朋友012---This is Monica, Phoebe's friend.
听着  菲比跟大卫复合了012---Listen, Phoebe is back with David.
他即将要求婚012---He's gonna propose,
而她将会答应 但是我知道012---and she's gonna say yes... ...but l know
她真正想要的是跟你在一起012---she really wants to be with you.
他要求婚了012---He's gonna propose?
很抱歉  你说什么呢012---l'm sorry, did you say something?
该死的头发遮住我听不到012---l can't hear through all this damned hair!
如果菲比想要嫁给大卫012---lf Phoebe wants to marry David,
她就嫁吧012---she should.
我不会从中作梗012---l'm not gonna stand in the way of that.
你也不应该012---Neither should you.
你不用告诉我该怎么做012---You don't tell me what to do.
我来告诉你怎么做012---l tell you what to do.
打电话给她012---Just call her.
她在巴巴多斯的天堂饭店012---She's at the Paradise Hotel in Barbados.
对了  既然联系上你了  你也有卷发012---And while l've got you, you've got curly hair.
在湿气重的地方你怎么办呢012---What do you do in the humidity?
该死的012---Damn it!
嗯  我希望你很快乐012---Well, l hope you're happy.
我也希望你很快乐  亲爱的012---l hope you're happy too, honey.
菲比会答应大卫的求婚012---Phoebe's going to say yes to David.
这就是你爱管闲事的结果012---That's what happens when you meddling people's lives.
菲比要答应  太棒了012---Phoebe's gonna say yes? That's great.
不  一点也不  她还爱着迈克012---No, it's not. She's still in love with Mike.
那不会有什么结果的吗012---There's no chance that will work?
没有  我已经打过电话了012---No, l called.
不会发生的012---lt's not gonna happen.
鸡婆  鸡婆012---Meddler! Meddler!
如果你不先多管闲事...012---lf you hadn't meddled to start with...
那我就不用插手012---...then l wouldn't have had to
进来管事了012---go in and meddle myself.
不管我们插手多深012---No matter how much we meddle,
我们都没有办法补救...012---we'll never be able to unmeddle...
你一开始多管闲事惹出来的祸012---...the thing that you meddled up in the first place!
这假期真是烂012---This vacation sucks!
我好无聊012---l'm so bored.
愚蠢的雨012---Stupid rain.
我们什么都做不了012---We can't do anything.
我带了些书来012---Well, l brought some books.
我们可以看书012---We could read.
嘿  还没糟糕到那个地步012---Hey, it hasn't come to that yet.
嘿  等一下012---Hey, hey, hey, don't mind if l do.
对不起  先生012---l'm sorry, sir,
这些是给药学研讨会的012---these are for the pharmaceutical convention.
你想要去参加研讨会吗012---You feel like going to a convention?
我们不行012---We can't.
我们不是药剂师012---We're not pharmacists.
我知道我们不是...012---l know we're not...
但是法兰克·马迭欧跟伊娃...012---...but Frank Madaio and Eva....
凯特·米勒012---Kate Miller.
就凯特·米勒了012---Kate Miller it is.

哦  很好...012---Oh, good--
而这将是我这周末012---And that's the most sex
仅能有的性事了012---l'm gonna have this weekend.
如果是这样012---Well, in that case,
那我一定得让你感觉好啊012---should l make sure it's on real good?
谢谢你012---Thank you.
然后你开始谈到012---Oh, and then you said that
中生代世纪...012---thing about bringing the Mesozoic Era...
带到二十一世纪012---...into the 21 st century.
对  就这样吗012---Well, yeah. That's it?
天啊  我们办到了012---Oh, my God. We did it.
事实上是我办到了  罗斯012---Actually, l did it, ross.
你对自己演讲稿的记忆012---You remembered shockingly little
真是少到惊人012---of your own speech.
是的  但是我倒是用沐浴产品012---Yes, but l did make a pyramid
做了个金字塔012---out of the bath products.
这真是惊人  谢谢012---Oh, this is amazing. Thank you.
真是很谢谢你012---Thank you so much.
你的项链真漂亮012---That's a pretty necklace.
谢谢012---Thank you.
我们来庆祝一下吧012---Hey, what do you say we celebrate?
要香槟吗012---Champagne?
好啊  软木塞留着012---Yeah! Save the cork,
这样我们就可以 把瓶子装满水...012---and that way, we can fill the bottle with water...
然后再放回去 他们就不会收钱了012---...and put it back so they don't charge you.
我的天啊  我爱你012---Oh, my God, l love you.
艾玛这张照片真是可爱012---This is such a cute picture of Emma.
而这是你儿子...012---And is this your son...
还是你会带在身上012---...or just some kid whose picture
某个小男孩照片呢012---you bring on vacation?
那是本  我第一次婚姻所生的儿子012---That's Ben, my son from my first marriage.
你第一次婚姻012---Your first marriage?
是的012---Yeah.
你结过不只一次婚吗012---You've been married more than once?
没有012---No.
那你为什么离婚呢012---So why'd you break up?
嗯  因为...012---Oh, it was--
很复杂的  她是...012---lt's complicated, you know? She was...
同性恋012---...gay.
我的天啊012---Oh, my God.
这实在太酷了012---This is so cool!
好的  为这怪事兴奋是很奇怪的事012---Okay. Odd thing to get excited about.
不是  只是我曾经跟一个男的订婚过012---No, it's just that l was engaged to a guy
而他最后竟然是同志012---who turned out to be gay.
嘿  击掌吧012---Hey! High-five!
你有没有觉得没有看出端倪012---Didn't you feel so stupid
实在是很笨呢012---that you didn't see the signs?
我未婚夫总是跟012---My fiance was always going on
他的"网球球友"一起度周末012---long weekends with his ''tennis partner.''
我老婆有年跟一个朋友012---My wife had a workout friend
天天都到健身房健身012---she went to the gym with every day for a year.
她也没有变瘦012---She didn't get any fitter.
每个人都说"我早就知道了"012---Everybody's like, ''l knew all along.''
我知道 如果知道  怎么不告诉我呢012---l know. lf you knew, why didn't you tell me?
我是说只要打电话  给个纸条012---l mean, call, leave a note.
"嗨  只是过来告诉你 你老婆是同性恋"012---''Hi. Just dropped by to say your wife's gay.''
我知道012---l know.
然后...012---And then--
然后你试着在困境中求生存...012---And then you try to make the best of a bad situation...
所以你提出三人行的建议012---...so you float the idea of a threesome.
我没有那样做012---l didn't do that.
我也没有012---Me neither.
谁会知道呢012---Well, who knew?
药剂师们真好玩012---Pharmacists are fun.
我知道  那位老太太012---l know. That old lady at the end
最后都已经准备要带你回家了012---was ready to take you home.
这世界的药还是不够的  瑞秋012---Not enough pills in the world, Rach.
那你呢  你才是单身的人012---What about you, huh? You're the single one.
有没有看到喜欢的人呢012---See anybody in there you like?
让我想想012---Well, let's see.
那个跟我012---There was that really big guy
说过话的大个儿...012---that l was talking to...
有着很不错的胸部012---...with the really nice breasts.
那在家呢012---But what about back home?
有什么吗012---Anything going on there?
你有喜欢的人吗012---Anybody you like?
没有012---No.
有的  你脸红了012---There is. You're blushing.
没有  我没有脸红012---No, l'm not blushing...
这是晒伤的012---...and l'm sunburned.
因为下雨的缘故012---From, you know, the rain.
你喜欢某人  告诉我是谁012---You like someone. Tell me who.
不  乔伊012---No. Joey.
你喜欢谁呢012---Who do you like?
你别想轻易躲掉012---You're not getting away that easy.
你喜欢谁呢012---Who do you like?
乔伊  别这样012---Joey, come on!
没什么大不了的  你知道吗012---lt doesn't matter, you know?
又不是说会发生什么事012---lt's not like anything's gonna happen.
什么  为什么不呢012---What? Why not?
瑞秋  有谁你得不到呢012---Rach, who can you not get?
好012---Okay. Okay.
你真想知道是谁吗012---You really want to know who it is?
是的  是谁呢012---Yeah. Who is it?
你真的想012---Do you?
嗨012---Oh, hey.
我才刚留言给你012---l just left you a message.
罗斯跟我刚要去吃点东西...012---Ross and l were gonna go grab a bite...
但是既然你在这里012---...but now that you're here,
我们可以共用晚餐了012---we could have that dinner.
没错  当然012---Right! Of course.
演讲稿写完了吗012---Hey, did you guys finish the speech?
是的  完成了  我们完成了012---Yep! We got it. We got it.
非常谢谢012---Thank you so much.
我很愉快012---l had a great time.
是啊012---Yeah.
这还没完012---This isn't over,
因为我真的想知道...012---because l really want to know--
等一下  等一下012---Later. Later.
那我们走吧012---So shall we?
好的012---Yeah.
好的012---Okay.
晚安012---Good night.
晚安012---Good night.
好的  晚安012---Okay, good night.
晚安  罗斯012---Good night, Ross.
我不敢相信她会答应大卫012---l can't believe she's gonna say yes to David.
她很明显还是爱着迈克012---She's clearly in love with Mike.
你看起来这样子012---You know, it's very hard to
实在很难把你的话当真012---take you seriously when you look like that.
菲比  有些话我要跟你说012---Phoebe, l have something l want to say.
天啊  他要开口了012---Oh, God, he's gonna do it.
我看不下去  我们走012---l cannot watch this. Let's go.
我想我们还有时间012---l think we have time.
你有听过他说话吗012---Have you heard him talk?
"菲比  我将会很荣幸如果..."012---''Phoebe, l would be honored if--''
说快点  大卫012---Spit it out, David!
菲比012---Phoebe.
你实在是太好了012---You're an amazing woman,
我们分开的时候实在无法让人忍受012---and the time we spent apart was unbearable.
当然明斯克卫生设施员工的012---Of course, the sanitation strikes
罢工让情况更糟012---in Minsk didn't help.
当然  好的  是的012---Sure. Okay. Yeah.
但是现在我们又一起了012---But, well, now that we're together again,
我再也不想分开了012---l don't ever want to be apart.
所以...012---So to that end....
我的天啊  迈克012---Oh, my God, Mike.
事实上  我是大卫012---lt's David, actually.
不  迈克在这里012---No, Mike's here.
嘿  迈克012---Oh, hey, Mike.
嗨  大卫012---Hi, David.
钱德勒  莫妮卡... 哇012---Chandler. Monic-- Oh!
是湿气012---lt's the humidity!
嗨  菲比012---Hi, Phoebe.
你在这里做什么呢012---What are you doing here?
我有个问题必须要问你012---l have a question l need to ask you.
我也有个问题012---l have a question
要问她012---l was kind of gonna ask her myself.
我了解  但是在你那样做之前012---Yeah, l understand, but before you do,
她真的需要先听我说012---she really needs to hear this.
好的012---Okay.
你要坐我的座位吗012---Would you care for my seat as well?
事实上会很好012---Actually, yeah, that'd be great.
很公平012---Well, that's fair,
你一路这么远赶来012---you've had a long trip.
菲比  我爱你012---Phoebe, l love you.
在过去几个月里012---l've missed you so much
我非常想念你012---these last few months.
我原以为我们分开是有好理由的012---l thought we were apart for a good reason...
但是我发现012---...but l realized that
根本没有够好的理由...012---there was no reason good enough...
能够让我不与你012---...to keep me from spending
共度下半辈子012---the rest of my life with you.
有点毁了我将要说的话012---Kind of steps on the toes of what l was going to say.
抱歉  大卫012---l'm sorry, David,
但是她真的有需要知道这些012---but she really has to know this.
好的  但是之后012---All right, when you're through,
我要在外面跟你单挑012---l want to see you outside.
如果外面停止下雨的话012---lf it stops raining.
你是我遇过最不可思议的女人012---You're the most incredible woman l've ever met.
我怎么能够失去你呢012---How could l lose you?
我现在并没有戒指012---Now, l don't actually have a ring.
我有戒指012---l have a ring.
我不会在这时候炫耀  老兄012---l wouldn't brag about that, big guy.
但是  菲比...012---But, Phoebe...
你愿意嫁给我吗012---...will you marry me?
不012---No.
我爱你012---l love you,
但是我从不需要你求婚012---but l never needed a proposal from you.
我只需要知道我们之间是有发展的012---l just needed to know we were headed somewhere.
我们是有未来的012---That we had a future.
我们可以有任何你想要的未来012---We can have any future you want.
好的  我要走了012---Okay, well, l'm gonna take off.
大卫  我很抱歉  我好抱歉012---David, l'm so sorry. l'm sorry.
让我知道一下  如果我先问了012---Just so l know, if l had asked first...?
我有可能会答应012---Yeah, l might have said yes,
但是那是不对的012---but that would've been wrong.
你不用解释  没关系012---Please, you don't have to explain.
我是说  如果我当初没有去明斯克...012---l mean, perhaps if l hadn't gone to Minsk...
我们之间可能就没问题了012---...things would have worked out for us,
而我也不会毁了我的事业012---and l wouldn't have ruined my career.
或是因冻疮而失去那根脚趾012---Or lost that toe to frostbite.
这旅行还不错012---lt was a good trip.
我现在可以拥抱你吗012---ls it okay if l hug you now?
喔  可以012---Oh, yes.
就是因为我们的多管闲事  好吗012---Because of our meddling! All right?
这样不是很好吗012---Oh, isn't this nice?
如此安静  我可以整天都躺在这里012---lt's so quiet. l could just lie here all day.
我知道012---Oh, l know.
打开窗帘  打开窗帘012---Open your drapes! Open your drapes!
我们的房间是相通的还真不错呢012---So glad we got adjoining rooms.
太阳出来了012---The sun is out!
嘿  记得我看得到的时候吗012---Hey! Remember when l had corneas?
赶快去游泳池占位子012---Go to the pool and reserve chairs.
我会拿杂志跟防晒乳液012---l will get the magazines and the lotion.
罗斯的演讲再四十五分就开始了012---Ladies? Ross' speech is in 45 minutes.
不012---No!
该死的012---Damn it!
墙壁很薄的  你们这些人012---Walls are pretty thin, guys.
我们必须考量最近磁共振造影资料012---''Then we have to weigh the data from recent MRl scans
与去氧核糖核酸测试资料...012---and DNA testing...
而这些对多年来的碳年代012---...which call into question information
测定资料收集方式形成了一些疑点012---gathered from years of carbon dating.''
瞧瞧那个坐在游泳池畔012---Look at the woman sitting out
享受日光浴的女人012---by the pool getting tan.
她的皮都有皱纹了012---She's all leathery and wrinkled.
我真是忌妒012---l'm so jealous!
最后  有最近 许多丰富新物种的发现012---''Finally, factor in the profusion of new species recently discovered.
巨兽龙012---Giganotosaurus.
阿根廷龙012---Argentinosaurus.''
更不用提冷龙012---Not to mention Coldsaurus.
而这些只是草食性的012---''And that's just the herbivores.
我还没有要提到肉食性的012---l'm not even gonna discuss the carnivores.
他们的头都已经是太大了012---Their heads are already too big.
这是蛮讽刺的012---Which is ironic,
因为他们的大脑却是发育不良的012---considering their stunted cerebral development.''
真的吗012---Really?
但是撇开玩笑不谈012---''But all kidding aside,
这是相同于...012---in much the same way...
匠人曾被认为是直立人的012---...that Homo ergaster is thought to be
另一个分支012---a separate species from Homo erectus....''
什么012---What?
他说"勃起"（erectus:直立人  还有勃起的意思）012---He said "erectus."
你在开玩笑吗012---You're kidding, right?
不  他是真的那样说012---No, he really said it.
而当然有许多很大的差异...012---''And while there are certainly vast differences...
介于这些中生代化石012---...between these Mesozoic fossils
跟此直立人例子012---and the example of Homo erectus....''
勃起？012---Erectus?
同性恋（Homo:人属中的一支  也有同性恋的意思）012---Homo.
没错012---Right.
"用非常真实的方式012---''ln a very real way,
我们可以将中生代时期012---we can bring the Mesozoic Era
带入二十一世纪"012---into the 21 st century.''
谢谢012---Thank you.
真的很棒012---Really great.
谢谢你们012---Oh, thanks, guys.
我认为很精采012---l thought it was wonderful.
我是杰维斯·欧伯劳 康乃尔大学012---Jarvis Oberblau. Cornell.
你突显出来的议题012---l mean, the ideas you put forth,
尤其是你是这样的年轻而且...012---and from someone so young and....
好的  现在我们只是在握着手012---Okay, now we're just holding hands.
好的  我们要去海滩了012---Alrighty. We're gonna hit the beach.
演讲真的很棒012---That was really great.
谢谢012---Oh, thank you.
是啊  而且很有趣012---Yeah. Oh, and so funny.
放轻松点012---Take it easy.
好的  谢谢  非常谢谢012---All right, thanks. Thanks so much.
我无法告诉你012---l can't tell you how much it means
你们在此对我意义有多大012---that you were here.
你在开玩笑吗  我们不可能会错过的012---You kidding? We wouldn't have missed it.
我回来了012---l'm back.
好的  失陪一下好吗012---Okay. Well, excuse me?
怎么样012---Well?

那至少012---Oh, well, at least
我们都过得很愉快  不是吗012---we're both having fun, right?

我只是...012---l just....
或许你并没有一直都012---Okay. Maybe you're not always

我告诉你  瑞秋012---l'm telling you, Rach,

多久了呢012---Well, for how long?
大概只有一个月012---Oh, only like a month.
一个月012---A month?
嗯...012---Well--
小声点012---Dial it down.
或许只是一些疯狂的想法012---Listen, maybe they're crazy thoughts,
但是有时候我就是会想啊012---but sometimes l do.
我一直在想我们之间的可能性012---l have been thinking about, you know, us.
好的  现在音调提高一点012---Okay, dial it up a little.
你说的对  好的012---Oh, you're right. Okay.
我只有一个问题 该死012---l just have a question. Shoot.
你倒底是在做什么012---What the hell are you doing?
我在努力不做任何事情012---l'm not trying to do anything.
只是当我们在一起时012---lt's just, we have such a good time
非常地快乐  你知道吗012---when we're together, you know?
你难道都没有好奇过012---And l mean, aren't you just a little curious
那会是怎样吗012---what it would be like?
我好奇过  我就跟...012---Am l curious? l mean, l'm as curious as...

这就是我说的012---See, this is what l'm talking about.
我知道  我们棒透了012---No, l know. We're great!
但是瑞秋  不  不能这样的012---But, Rach, no, this can't happen.
不能有一点点机会吗012---Can't it just happen a little bit?
不  一点也不行012---No! lt can't happen at all!
为什么不行012---Why not?
因为  你看012---Because, look,
我最希望事情是这样了  好吗012---no one wants this to happen more than me, okay?
我在我脑海中已经幻想过012---l have gone over this moment
这情节一百次了012---in my head 100 times...
而且我从没拒绝过012---...and not once did l ever say no.
我不能这样对罗斯012---l couldn't do it to Ross.
但之前却不是这样012---But that wasn't gonna stop you before.
我知道...012---l know. l know...
但是在那之后我想了很多012---...but l've thought about it a lot since then,
这是不对的012---and it just wouldn't be right.
我很抱歉012---l'm sorry.
我也很抱歉012---l'm sorry too.
天啊  我不应该说出来的012---Oh, God, l shouldn't have said anything.
不...012---No, no.
别这样  我们没事的012---No, no, no, no. Hey, we'll be fine.

喔  对了012---Oh, by the way,
输给一个女生感觉如何呢012---how did that feel, losing to a girl?
你应该先照照镜子012---You should look in the mirror
再这样说012---before you call yourself that.
不  不  不012---No! No! No!
而就是这样结束了012---And that's how it's done.
好了012---Okey-dokey.
你们都各赢了一局012---You've each won a game,
而我感觉好像是失去了一年的生命012---and l've lost what's felt like a year of my life.
每个人都可以跟一个赢家回家012---Everybody goes home a winner.
三战两胜012---Best of three?
我就是这样想012---That's what l'm thinking.
我应该运用我的隐形术012---Should l use my invisibility
来打击罪犯还是干坏事012---to fight crime or for evil?
开球吧  木头人012---Serve the ball, chump.

他一直在笑"直立人"012---he kept laughing at ''Homo erectus.''
我就知道是他012---l knew that was him!

是的  我有必要012---Yes, l do.
我或许无法理解012---l may not understand
你为什么一定要赢...012---why you have to win so badly...
但是如果这对你很重要012---...but if it's important to you,
对我就很重要012---it's important to me.
