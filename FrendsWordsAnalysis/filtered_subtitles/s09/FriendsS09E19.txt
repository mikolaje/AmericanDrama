可以在回家路上的012---We'll hit all the maple-candy stores
再去每间枫糖糖果店012---on the way back...
而且如果他们关门了012---...and if they're closed,
或许我们可以找棵树012---then maybe we'll tap a tree
自己做枫糖012---and make some ourselves.
那个房间有个衣橱012---Does that room have a closet

这不好012---That's not cool.
兄弟  这一切都不好012---Dude, none of this is cool.
听着  钱德勒  你要找出介于偷窃...012---Look, Chandler, you have to find the line between stealing...
拿取饭店欠你的东西之间的界线012---...and taking what the hotel owes you.
例如  吹风机  不不不012---For example: A hair dryer, no, no.
但是洗发精跟润发乳  可以可以012---But shampoos and conditioners, yes, yes.
盐巴罐就过分了012---Now, the salt shaker is off limits.

是啊  我是说那种很激情的012---Oh, yeah. l mean, it was pretty intense.
-为什么会那样呢  -我不知道012---- What brought that on? - l don't know.
或许跟我看到他演出那场爱情戏有关012---Maybe it had to do with the fact l saw him do a love scene.
-爱情戏  跟谁呢  -奥莉维亚012---- A love scene? With who? - Olivia.
奥莉维亚012---Olivia?!
我以为她要跟康纳结婚了012---l thought she was marrying Connor?!
对了  现实生活比较重要012---Oh, right. Real life more important.
你认为我的梦代表什么吗012---You think my dream means anything?
我不知道012---l don't know.
你看到他演出爱情戏012---l mean, you saw him do a love scene.
或许对乔伊没有感觉012---So maybe you don't have a thing for Joey.
或许你是对德雷克有感觉012---Maybe you have a thing for Drake.
是啊  在梦里是当乔伊012---Well, it was Joey reading
在念德雷克台词的时候012---Drake's lines in the dream.

我的歌不够格登上你们餐厅的大雅之堂吗012---My songs aren't good enough for your restaurant?

我没有说它们不够格012---l didn't say they weren't good enough.

我点了熏鲑鱼开胃菜012---l ordered the smoked salmon appetizer,
但是我看不到鲑鱼  我看不到012---but l can't see it. l can't see it.''
菲比  份量不是最重要的012---Phoebe, it's not about quantity.
喔  品质也不是最重要的012---Well, it's not about quality.
真的吗  你想要谈品质吗012---Oh, really? You wanna talk about quality?
你有听过什么叫"调"吗012---Have you ever heard of a ''key''?
那是大家唱歌要对的012---lt's what some people sing in.
至少我所有的歌都没有大蒜味012---Well, at least all my songs don't taste like garlic.
是的  莫妮卡 还有其它的东西可以拿来调味的012---Yeah, there are other ingredients, Monica.
所以我们要这样做啰012---So that's what we're doing.
当我在咖啡厅里跟着你的歌打拍子时012---When l'm in a coffeehouse bopping along to one of your songs...
我是有戴耳塞的012---...l'm wearing earplugs.
是耳塞还是蒜头塞呢012---Earplugs or cloves of garlic?
你知道吗  我收回我所说的话012---You know what? l take back what l said before.
继续到餐厅演唱吧012---Keep playing at the restaurant,
因为你的音乐会把人逼进餐厅里...012---because with your music driving people inside...
我们吧台的营业量会疯狂激长的012---...my bar sales have gone up like crazy.
他们都点什么呢  蒜头马提尼吗012---What are people having, the garlic martini?

拿了一袋子的猫往墙上挥012---was swinging a bag of cats against the wall.
你最好回去厨房012---You'd better get back in that kitchen.
蒜头是不会自己多用自己的012---The garlic's not gonna overuse itself.
好了  你现在必须要停唱了012---Okay, you have to stop playing now.
为什么012---Why?

好的  我本来真的希望有人鼓掌的012---Okay, l was actually expecting a little applause there,
但是没关系012---but whatever.
一个问题  请大家举手回答012---Quick question. By a show of hands...
你们有谁被这女人012---...how many of you were bothered

好的  好的012---Okay, okay.
你们有谁喜欢外面的音乐呢012---How many of you enjoyed the music outside?
让我问你们这个问题012---Let me ask you this question.
有谁认为音乐还好...012---How many thought the music was fine...
但是跟本餐厅的格调不符呢012---...but not in keeping with the tone of the restaurant?
好的  谁认为这个餐厅的格调是012---Okay, well, who identified this restaurant's tone as
"自以为是又充满蒜头味"呢012---''pretentious-comma-garlicky''?
好的  有谁觉得食物是很美味的012---Okay, who thinks the food is delicious
而一点点做作是没关系的012---and a little pretension never hurt anyone?
好了  没关系012---Okay, well, all right,
有谁觉得食物很好 音乐也很棒012---who thinks the food is fine, the music was fine...
但是你的晚餐已经012---...but your evening was ruined
被这个持续不断的民意调查给毁了012---by this incessant poll-taking?
不好意思012---Excuse us.
好了  我问你012---All right, here's a question.
有谁认为她的餐厅是那么的高级…012---Who was so worried about her restaurant being fancy...
让她过分的担心012---...that she made a big deal
她的朋友会演唱不适当的音乐…012---about her friend playing her music...
而现在真的觉得很难过呢012---...and feels really bad about it now?
有谁很愚蠢又很顽固...012---Well, who was so stupid and stubborn...
批评了她朋友的烹饪技术…012---...that she lashed out against her friend's cooking...
而其实她是觉得她的烹饪很好呢012---...which she actually thinks is pretty great?
我很抱歉012---l'm sorry.
我也很抱歉012---l'm sorry too.
嘿  你要不要留下来012---Hey, you wanna stick around

乔伊  你的头后面有花生酱吗012---Joey, do you have peanut butter on the back of your head?
喔  天啊  我以为我都擦掉了012---Oh, man. l thought l got it all.
怎么会...012---How...?
怎么弄到的呢012---How?
我正在做花生酱冰沙012---l was making a peanut butter smoothie, right?
我找不到果汁机012---l couldn't find this little plastic thingy
上面那个小塑胶盖012---that goes in the top of the blender.
然后我想012---And l thought,
"那个小东西有什么重要的呢"012---''Well, you know, how important can that be?'' Right?
结果是非常重要012---Turns out, very.
哇  一定只是因为德雷克012---Wow, definitely just Drake.
什么012---What?
德雷克演得如何呢012---How's it going with Drake?
我想可能演的不是很好012---l don't think it's going very well.
什么012---What?
我看的那一场戏很好啊012---That scene l saw was so good.
我对明天要拍的那场戏012---Well, l'm feeling really insecure
觉得很没安全感012---about the one we're shooting tomorrow.
你是不是又故意说自己很糟012---ls this that thing you do
然后让我来赞美你呢012---when you say you're bad so l'll give you a compliment?
有点012---A little.
不  我是真的很担心012---No, l really am worried.
我必须要演得像是012---l have to make it convincing
我真的爱上奥莉维亚012---that l'm in love with Olivia.
所以呢012---So?
所以...我从来没有演过那种戏012---So l've never played that.
喔  亲爱的012---Oh, honey,
那不会很难的012---it can't be that hard.
你也有谈过恋爱啊012---l mean, you've been in love before.
嗯  只有一次...012---Well, just once...
就是跟你012---...with you.
好了  这实在是有点尴尬012---Okay. Well, this could be a little awkward.
我们跳过好了012---l'm just gonna blow past it.
听着  你何不运用你那个特殊方法012---Well, look, can't you just use that method-actor thing...
就是利用你的真实生活回忆012---...where you use your real-life memories
来帮助演出呢012---to help you in your performance?
你在说什么012---What the hell are you talking about?
好的  只要试着回忆起012---All right, look, just try to remember
你在谈恋爱时候的感觉012---how you felt when you were in love...
然后在演出的时候回想起那些感觉012---...and think about that when you're playing the scene.
好的  是啊  我想我做的到012---Okay. Yeah, l think l can do that.
好的  有个晚会的剧情012---Yeah. Okay, there's this party scene coming up.
奥莉维亚跟她老公就在那里012---And Olivia and her husband are there...
而德雷克想要做的只有抓住她012---...and all Drake wants to do is grab her
然后亲吻她  但是他不能012---and kiss her, but he can't.
那让我想起许多时候012---That makes me think about those times
我好想抓住你  然后亲吻你012---l wanted to grab you and kiss you...
但是你并不知道012---...but you didn't know,
所以我只能假装没事012---so l would just pretend everything was cool...
但这真的让我很受折磨012---...but really it was killing me.
乔伊  你从来没有说过这些012---Joey, you never talked about that before.
嘿  你知道我还可以用什么吗012---Hey, you know what else l could use?
有一场戏是德雷克012---There's this scene
偷偷溜进奥莉维亚的房间012---where Drake sneaks into Olivia's bedroom...
她不知道他就在那里012---...and she doesn't know he's there,
当然  我们之间没有发生过这样的事012---which never happened with us.
他知道他不应该去那里012---l mean, he knows he shouldn't be there,
但是他只想看看她012---but he just wants to look at her.
你知道吗012---You know?
而且我记得有好那些早晨012---And l remember all those mornings
就在你素颜时012---before you even put on your makeup...
我也会想"天啊  她真是美丽"012---...when l would think to myself, ''My God, she is beautiful.''
而且让我好心痛012---And it hurt so much because l knew
因为我知道我永远不能告诉你012---l could never tell you.
但是光是看着你012---But it was worth it
我就觉得心满意足了012---just to be there looking at you.
谢了  真是太棒了012---Thanks, dude. This is great!
我从佛蒙特州帮你带了些东西012---l got you something from Vermont.
卫生面条跟盐巴以外的东西吗012---Besides tampons and salt?
喔  我的天012---Oh, my God.
枫糖糖果  你真是贴心012---Maple candy. That's so sweet of you.
真是奇怪  里面是空的012---That's weird, it's empty.
嘿  你们好  干嘛呢012---Hi, you guys. What's going on?
你们要一块儿呆会儿么...012---You guys wanna hang out or...?
你们有听到嗡嗡声吗012---Do you guys hear a buzzing?
