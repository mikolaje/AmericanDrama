真的  你是实习生012---Seriously, you're an intern?
我正准备换个行业012---I'm heading in a new career direction
得从头做起嘛012---and you gotta start at the bottom.
老兄012---Dude.
我知道我比你们大一些012---I know I'm a little older than you guys,

那个喜剧演员  参加劳军联合组织的012---The comedian. USO.

我现在就可以走012---I could go right now.
-走  走啊  -我不能012---- Go! Go!  - I can't.
我想走  长暂停012---Oh, I want to, Long Pause
但是我不能走012---but I can't.
打断一下  你不应该把"长暂停"说出来012---So sorry. You're not supposed to say ''long pause.''
我以为那是你角色的名字012---Oh! Oh, I thought that was your character's name. You know?

他根本不会演戏012---He can't act.
我不在乎你是不是觉得他很帅012---I don't care if you think he's hot.
如果你想要跟他上床  随你便012---lf you want to sleep with him, do it on your own time.

-准备好了吗   -好了012---- Ready?  - Yeah.
你太用脑子012---You're in your head.
想的太多了012---You're thinking way too much.
我真的很怀疑012---I really doubt that.
不是  你并没有跟你的身体联系起来012---No, no. It's that you're not connected with anything in your body.
没表达出迫切感012---There's no urgency.
这一幕是很纠结的012---The scene is a struggle.
是一种竞赛  还有012---It's a race. Also,
你的表演是水平的012---what you did was horizontal.
别害怕发掘垂直的情感012---Don't be afraid to explore the vertical.
而且不要体会那些文字012---And don't learn the words.
让文字体会你012---Let the words learn you.
我不能跟制作人睡一睡就好了吗012---Couldn't I just sleep with the producer?
要不要一起去吃晚餐012---Hey, do you want to go to dinner tonight?
不行  我要跟女服务生约会  叫凯蒂012---l can't. l've got a date with that waitress, Katie.
虽然我们只出去过两次  但我好像...012---l know we've only gone out, like, twice, but l don't know...
对她的印象很不错012---l have a good feeling about her.
我听到离婚的钟声了012---Oh, l hear divorce bells.
钱包交出来  不然你们的麻烦就大了012---Give me your wallets, and there won't be a problem.
什么012---What?
我有枪012---l have a gun.
好的  不要怕  菲比  保持冷静012---Okay, relax, Phoebe. Just stay calm.
我的天呐  找不到我的钱包了012---Oh, my God, l can't find my wallet!
好了  女士  把你的包给我了012---All right, lady, now give me your purse.
不给012---No.
你说不给是什么意思012---What do you mean ''no''?
我就知道你会害死我的  菲比·布菲012---l knew you'd be my death, Phoebe Buffay!
罗威  是你吗012---Lowell, is that you?
菲比012---Phoebe?
我的天啊012---Oh, my God!
不可思议  我的天012---Unbelievable! Oh, my God!
抱歉  罗斯012---l'm sorry. Ross,
这是我流浪街头时的老朋友  罗威012---this is my old friend, Lowell, from the streets!
罗威  这位是罗斯012---Lowell, Ross.
罗斯  很高兴认识你012---Ross, nice to meet you.
是啊  真是高兴012---Yeah, a real pleasure.
真是好久了  哇  真久012---lt's been so long! Oh, so long.
不敢相信你还在干这行012---l can't believe you're still doing this.
我知道  但是我戒烟了012---l know. But l quit smoking.
好极了012---Good for you.
看起来你过得不错012---You look like you're doing well.
我猜你已经金盆洗手  不抢劫了012---l guess your mugging days are behind you.
我的天  菲比  你以前抢劫012---Oh, my God. Phoebe, you used to mug people?
对不起  罗斯  我们老朋友正在叙旧呢012---Excuse me, Ross, old friends catching up.
试演怎么样012---How'd the audition go?
他们要我再去  但是…012---They want to see me again, but...
李奥·海斯不喜欢我012---...Leonard Hayes did not like me.
怎么了012---What happened?
他说我迫切感不够012---He said l wasn't urgent enough.
我演的是水平的012---Everything l did was horizontal,
应该要垂直一点012---and l should be more vertical.
他说我应该不要想太多012---He said that l should think less.
目前为止你做的不错012---Well, so far so good.
亲爱的  我老了（我回来了）012---Honey, l'm old!
怎么了012---What's wrong?
跟其他的实习生比  我太老了012---I am so much older than these other interns.
拿什么和他们争012---I can't compete with them.
你是年纪比较大一点没错012---So you're a little older.
往好处想  你有更多的生活经历012---Look at the positive. You have all this life experience.
是的  但生活经历012---Yes, but I don't think life experience
帮不了我  这个012---is gonna help me with these.
它们就像着火了012---Wow! It's like they're on fire!
这是什么012---What are they?
样品鞋012---Prototype sneakers.
要我想出销售策略  我想不出来012---I need ideas on how to sell them. Which I can't do...
因为但凡有自尊的成年人012---...because no self-respecting adult
都不会穿这种东西的012---would ever wear these.
我给你五百块  这鞋我买了012---I'll give you $500 for them.
我应该怎么办呢012---What am I supposed to do?
别这样  运动鞋很容易啦012---Come on, sneakers are easy.
你也总穿啊012---You wear them all the time.
首先  它们现在不叫运动鞋了012---They're not called sneakers anymore.
改叫"霹雳鞋"或是"滑轮鞋"012---They're called ''kicks'' or ''skids.''
我还听到有人说"轮鞋"012---I think I heard somebody say ''slorps.''
鞋的底部有凸出的轮子012---They've got wheels that pop out from the bottom
让你可以滑来滑去012---so you can roll around...
因为显然  走路太耗费体力了012---because apparently walking is too much exercise.
"孩子们  孩子们012---''Kids! Kids!
一路滑进儿童肥胖区吧  "012---Roll your way to childhood obesity!''
你可以帮我卖这些东西吗012---Would you help me try to sell these?
好的  有没有想过用大波霸呢012---Okay. Have you considered using a girl with huge knockers?
那不会是他们想要的012---That's not what they're looking for.
那对我很有用哦012---Hey, that would work on me.
你想我为什么要买婷美呢012---Why do you think I buy Mrs. Butterworth's?
你都猜不到刚才怎么了012---You'll never guess what just happened.
-我和菲比被打劫了  -你们没事吧012---- Phoebe and I got mugged!  - Are you okay?
没事  因为菲比认识那个劫匪012---Yeah. Phoebe knew the mugger.
你怎么会认识劫匪呢012---How do you know a mugger?
不好意思  除了我们六个人之外012---I'm sorry, I have friends
我还有其他朋友012---outside the six of us.
你知道他们是怎么认识的吗012---Know how she knew him?
因为菲比以前也是劫匪012---Because Phoebe used to mug people.
真的吗012---Seriously?
我不觉得这是什么光彩事012---Well, I'm not proud of it,
但是你们知道的012---but, you know...
当我流落街头的时候012---...when I was living on the street
也需要钱买食物什么的012---and I needed money for food and stuff....
菲比  这真是太恐怖了012---Phoebe, that is awful.
我不像你们那么有钱  好吗012---I wasn't rich like you guys, okay?
我没有金汤匙也没有飞天马012---I didn't eat gold and have a flying pony.
我生活得很艰苦012---I had a hard life.
我妈被毒贩子给杀了012---My mother was killed by a drug dealer.
你妈是自杀的012---Your mother killed herself.
她自己就是毒贩子012---She was a drug dealer.
幸好他和菲比认识012---Anyway, it was a good thing she knew him.
否则我会让他死得很难看012---I was about to do some serious damage.
好吧012---Okay.
一定勾起你的痛苦回忆了  罗斯012---This must have brought back some bad memories for you, Ross.
-为什么  -罗斯小时候被抢过012---- Why?  - Ross was mugged as a kid.
-是吗  -是的012---- You were?  - Yeah.
弱小的心灵受到了严重的打击012---And it was pretty traumatic.
就在圣马克漫画店外面012---It was outside St. Mark's Comics.
我正在忙着012---I was minding my business,
看蜘蛛侠又惹上什么麻烦了012---seeing what kind of trouble Spider-Man was into.
是神奇女侠012---Wonder Woman.
反正  我正去面包店的路上012---Anyway, I was heading towards this bakery...
帮某人买几十个甜蛋糕012---to pick up a couple of dozen linzer tortes for someone...
然后不知道从哪里冒出来的恶棍012---when out of nowhere, this thug with a pipe jumps out
拿着一根管子跳出来说...012---and says:
"把钱给我  笨蛋"012---''Give me your money, punk!''
我的天啊012---Oh, my God.
我知道  最糟糕的是012---I know. And the worst part was,
他们抢走了我的背包012---they took my backpack...
里面有我自己创作  亲手绘制012---...which had all the original artwork
我自己的漫画012---I did for my own comic book,
《科学小子》012---Science Boy.
对啊  他的超能力是什么来着012---Oh, yeah! What was his super power again?
一个对知识超级渴望的超人012---A super-human thirst for knowledge.
我要赶去上课了012---I better get to class.
你还有其他朋友012---Are there any more of your friends
需要我小心的吗  菲比012---I should look out for? Phoebe.
没有  事实上  你离简街远点012---No. Actually, you might want to stay away from Jane Street.
那是刺客乔的地盘012---That's where Stabby Joe works.
-我想我们有麻烦了  -怎么了012---- I think we have a problem here.  - What?
在我当劫匪的时候012---Back in my mugging days,
圣马可漫画店是我的地盘012---I worked St. Mark's Comics.
-然后呢  -管子是我用的武器012---- Yeah?  - A pipe was my weapon of choice...
少年和漫画书呆子  都是我的目标012---...and preteen, comic-book nerds were my meat.
所以呢012---So?
曾经有个小孩012---There was one kid
背包上有张贴纸  写着012---who had a sticker on his backpack that said:
-地质学酷毙了   -地质学酷毙了012---- Geology rocks!  - Geology rocks!
我的天啊012---Oh, my God!
我知道  我抢了罗斯012---I know! I mugged Ross!
-你迟到了  -我知道  我很抱歉012---- You're late.  - I know. I'm sorry.
我可以先跑去上个厕所吗012---But can I just run to the bathroom?
不行  李奥是不等人的012---No. Leonard doesn't wait.
但是我快尿出来了012---But I am bursting with Yoo-hoo!
乔伊  来吧012---Joey, here we go!
我们开始   快一点012---Let's go. Very quickly.
我真的想要...012---I really need--
现在就开始  快点012---We must go now, quickly.
-好  是的  -好了吗012---- Yeah. Yes, sir.  - Ready?
你怎么还在这里012---What the hell are you still doing here?
你知道的012---I think you know!
你这个该死的混蛋012---Oh, you sick bastard!
这都是你造成的  你知道吗012---I  am what you made me! Know what?
什么012---What?
我可以现在就走012---I could go right now.
那就走  走啊012---Then go. Go!
我不能  我想走  但是我不能走012---Oh, I can't. I want to, but I can't!
停  演得好012---Cut. That was good!
非常精彩  这就是我想要的012---Very good. You did everything I asked.
是吗012---I did?
是的  而且你把这种扭曲的特质012---Yes. Plus which, you've got this, I don't know, this squirmy quality
加入到这个角色中  简直出乎意料012---you bring to the character I couldn't have imagined.
我们接下来可以这样012---Here's what we're gonna do:
明天过来参加最后的试演012---Come back tomorrow for the final callbacks.
就照你今天这样演  但是012---Do all of this, what you got going now. But you know what?
加强  再加强  你可以吗012---More. More. Can you do that?
当然  我没时间说谢了012---Sure. I don't have time to say thank you
真的得走了012---because I really gotta go!
瞧瞧他  还那么入戏  我喜欢他012---Look at that! Still in character. I like him.
我播了种  无法言喻012---I plant seeds. I can't explain it. I don't know.
你在做什么012---Hey. What are you doing?
在试穿跑鞋012---Putting on the sneakers...
融入年轻人的世界012---to get in the young mindset,
看会不会激发出什么灵感012---see if it sparks anything.
-发出什么了  -你听这个012---- Oh, anything yet?  - Yes, how's this?
"此鞋让你的脚012---''They're so uncomfortable,
不舒服到像是被踢蛋蛋"012---it's like getting kicked in the nuts for your feet.''
你们可能很纳闷我在做什么012---You're probably wondering what I'm doing.
不  看起来很正常012---No, that seems about right.
昨天试演的时候我尿急012---Yesterday at my audition, I really had to pee.
很明显  夹着尿让我演技爆发了012---Apparently, having to pee makes me a good actor.
可以参加最后试演012---I got a callback,
所以能喝的我都喝了  对了012---so I'm drinking everything. Oh, by the way...
我们冰箱里面的蛋奶实在太好喝了012---that eggnog in our fridge was great!
乔伊  那是婴儿食品012---Joey, that was formula.
我们一定要多买一些012---We gotta get more of that.
这东西还不赖012---These aren't half bad.
你应该要向拉夫·劳伦推荐012---You should suggest these to Ralph Lauren.
第一  那很蠢012---Okay, first of all, that's stupid.
第二  他们不允许我跟拉夫说话012---Second, I'm not allowed to talk to Ralph.
好的  我已经觉得年轻多了012---All right. I feel younger already.
我的臀部好像摔伤了012---Yeah, I think I broke my hip.
嘿  你来了012---Hey, you!
嘿012---Hey.
嘿  课上得怎样012---Hey. How was class?
从来没人问过我的课  出什么事了012---No one asks me that. What's wrong?
-没事  就是很想知道而已  -哦012---- Nothing. I really want to know.  - Oh.
我们针对更新世012---Well, there was actually a rather lively discussion
讨论得相当热烈012---about the Pleistocene--
好了  我不需要这样折磨自己012---All right, nothing is worth this.
我有件事要对你坦白012---I have a confession to make.
你记得小时候打劫你的女生吗012---Okay, you know that girl that mugged you when you were a kid?
你说什么呢  那不是女生012---What are you talking about? It wasn't a girl.
是个魁梧大汉012---It was this huge dude.
你用说谎  我知道是个十四岁女生012---You don't have to lie anymore. I know that it was a 14-year-old girl.
不  不是012---No, it wasn't.
是  是的012---Yes, it was.
你认为我打不过一个十四岁女生吗012---You don't think I would have defended myself against a 14-year-old--?
"把钱给我  笨蛋"012---''Give me your money, punk!''
我的天  那是你012---Oh, my God, it was you!
我不敢相信  是你抢劫了我012---I can't believe it. You mugged me?
是的  我非常抱歉  罗斯  对不起012---Yeah. And I'm so, so sorry, Ross. I'm sorry.
但如果你再想一下  这其实挺不错的012---But, you know, if you think about it, it's kind of neat.
我的意思是012---I mean, well,
我常常觉得自己像是个局外人012---it's just that I've always felt kind of like an outsider.
你们几个人彼此都认识特别久了012---You know, the rest of you have connections that go way back...
而现在  你跟我也有老交情了012---...and, you know, now you and I have a great one.
这并不是好事012---It's not the best!
我知道  请原谅我012---I know. Please forgive me.
我不知道该说什么012---I don't know what to say.
你什么都不用说012---There's nothing you can say!

女孩们走出浴缸012---the girls get out of the hot tub...
开始一起亲热012---...and start making out with each other.
有趣012---That's interesting.
只有一件事012---Just one thought:
你没有提到鞋子012---You didn't mention the shoes.
下一个是谁  钱德勒012---Who's next? Chandler.
开始的画面  一个男人穿上这双鞋012---You start on the image of a guy putting on the shoes.
他大约是我这个年纪012---He's about my age.
-你的年纪  -对啊012---- Your age?  - Aha!
他在街上滑着  接着失去了控制012---He's rolling down the street and he starts to lose control.
或许他跌倒了012---Maybe he falls.
或许还受伤了012---Maybe he hurts himself.
就在这时候012---Just then,
一个小孩  穿着这双鞋  飞快地滑过去012---a kid comes flying by wearing the shoes.
他边笑边从这个男人身上跳过去012---He jumps over the old guy and laughs.
接着广告词出现…012---And the line reads:
"成人不宜"012---''Not suitable for adults.''
钱德勒  这个很棒012---Well, Chandler, that's great.
谢谢你  先生012---Thank you, sir.
或是  比我小两岁的人012---Or, man who's two years younger than me.
你们瞧  这才是清晰的卖点012---You see, that has a clear selling point.

你是怎么想出来的012---How did you come up with that?
我不知道  我不知道012---I don't know! I don't know!
我就是试着用年轻的心态去思考012---I was just trying to get into a young mindset,
然后灵感涌动012---and stuff started to flow.
太棒了  做得好012---That is great. Good work.
谢谢012---Thank you.
那我们大家明天见012---We'll see all of you tomorrow.
天一冷  臀部就疼012---The cold weather hurts my hip.
罗斯  我知道你还在生我的气012---Hey, Ross. I know you're still mad at me,
但我可以跟你谈一下吗012---but can I just talk to you for a sec?
当然  说吧  哦  等等012---Sure, go ahead. Oh, sorry.
当然  说吧012---Sure, go ahead.
我真的想要再次跟你道歉012---I just really wanted to apologize again.
而且让你看些012---And also show you something
你会觉得很兴奋的东西012---I think you'll find very exciting.
哦  我的天啊012---Oh, my God!
"街头收集来的垃圾"012---''Crap from the street!''
听着  罗斯  这箱子里012---Look, Ross. In this box...
都是我抢来012---...are all the things I got from mugging
觉得太特别而不想卖掉012---that I thought were too special to sell...
或是  抽掉的东西012---or smoke.
反正  我找了一下  找到了...012---Anyway, I was looking through it, and I found...

哦  我的天啊012---Oh, my God!
我没想到还会再见到它012---I never thought I'd see this again.
全部都在了012---It's all here!
你为什么这些年还留着它012---What made you save it all these years?
可能是我觉得它很棒012---I guess I just thought it was really good.
或许有一天会值钱012---And maybe it would be worth something one day.
你真的认为《科学小子》值得收藏012---You really thought Science Boy was worth saving?
是的  但是你应该知道012---Yeah. But you should know
我还留了一罐凡士林012---I also have a jar of Vaseline
跟一副猫头骨012---and a cat skull in here.
不管  这还是很惊喜012---Still, this is amazing!
我的天  谢谢你  菲比012---Oh, my God. Thank you, Phoebe.

我从他身上学到很多012---I learned a lot from him.
你不用客气012---You're welcome.
我需要答案012---I need an answer!

也永远都不会原谅我自己012---I can never forgive you myself.
我没有活下去的必要了  砰  结束012---I have nothing to live for. Bang! And scene!

这个角色是你的了012---The part is yours.

不  等等  恭喜了  你办到了012---No, wait! Congratulations! You did it.
你办到了  现在可以放轻松了012---You did it. You can relax now. Yeah.
哇  有线电视帐单真贵012---Wow! That's a big cable bill.
你没有工作012---You don't have a job,
倒很敢付钱看色情片啊012---but you have no problem ordering porn.
在星期六下午012---On a Saturday afternoon?
我也在家耶012---I was in the house!
嘿  菲比有没有提到...012---Hey. Phoebe didn't by any chance mention that--

我知道了  你有没有告诉...012---I see. You didn't happen to tell--
我们认识的每个人吗  我有012---Everybody we know? Yeah.
