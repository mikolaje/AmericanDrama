他还在气我们两个吗012---Is he still mad at us?
气你多过气我012---Well,you more than me.
他总不能太生我的气012---But he can't stay too mad at me.
我才刚生下他的小孩耶012---I mean,I just had his baby.
太不公平了  我又不会生012---That's not fair. I can't do that.
我不知道他上来时 你应不应该在场012---I'm not sure you should be here when he comes up.
那正是我所担心的012---Say that's what I was afraid of.
我也不认为我该在场012---I didn't think I should be here either.
但某人说罗斯现在该已经释怀了012---But somebody said he'd be over it.

但是我可以把这些小脚012---But I could take one of those little feet
放到面饼里面012---and put it in a pita pocket.
好了  我把大部分东西都放好了012---Okay. I put most of the stuff away.

你千万不要吵醒熟睡的婴儿012---You know,you're never supposed to wake a sleeping baby.
我高兴怎样就怎样  她是我生的012---Well,I can do whatever I want. I made her.
来吧  小宝贝  嗨  艾玛  嗨012---Come on,little girl. Yes. Hello,Emma. Hello.
我想说我早就警告过你了012---Well,I would say I told you so,

我很抱歉  妈咪很抱歉 再睡吧012---I'm sorry. Mommy's so sorry. Go back to sleep.
再睡觉吧012---Go back to sleep.
哭得真令人心碎  不是吗  没错012--- It breaks your heart,doesn't it?  It really does.
你认为我们还要呆多久012---How long do you think we have to stay?

时光倒流  听取菲比的警告吧012---"Go back in time and listen to Phoebe."
好了  试试看这个  什么012--- All right,here's something.  What?
上面说试着把婴儿抱起  贴近身体012---It says to try holding the baby close to your body..
然后快速地左右摇012---and then swing her rapidly from side to side.
好的012---Okay.
太有效了012---It worked!
不  只是让她吐了一点奶012---No. Just stopped to throw up a little bit.
莫妮  我该怎么办呢012---Mon,what am I gonna do?
已经好几个小时了  它就是哭个不停012---It's been hours,and it won't stop crying.

你的意思是012---You mean,like..
罗斯  我知道你生我的气012---Ross, I know you're pissed at me,

事实上  没必要012---Actually,we don't.
好吧  但是我必须说012---Fine. Okay. But I gotta say,
严格说来  我并没有做错什么012---technically,I didn't even do anything wrong.
什么  你并没有做错什么012---What? You didn't do anything wrong?
我是说严格说来  我是无心的  好吧012--- I said I didn't technically.  Okay.
我们暂时不说你"一不小心"012---Let's put aside the fact that you "accidentally"..
捡起我祖母的戒指012---picked up my grandmother's ring
然后又 "一不小心"向瑞秋求婚012---and you "accidentally" proposed to Rachel.
我可以先打断你一下吗012---Can I just stop you there for a second?
当别人做这个动作时012---When people do this:
我真的不知道是什么意思012---I don't really know what that means.
你刚刚说什么012---You were saying?
我尚可以理解你为何没向瑞秋解释012---And I could even understand that you couldn't tell Rachel.
但你为什么没告诉我呢012---But why couldn't you tell me?
你有一整天可以说  你却没有012---You had all day to,and you didn't.
我知道  我应该说的  "我很抱歉"012---I know. I should've. "I'm sorry."
你用错场合了  乔012---Not using it right,Joe.

为什么不打012---Why not?
你会比较好过  我也会比较好过012---You'll feel better. I'll feel better.
你心里清楚你想打我012---You know you want to,
我从你眼中看得出来012---I can see it in your eyes.
我不想  有一点想012--- I don't.  A little bit.
不想  有一点012--- No.  Little bit.
不想  多一点了012--- No.  A little bit more.
把袋子给我  不  打我012--- Give me the bag.  No. Hit me.
把那个袋子给我   打我012--- Give me the bag.  Hit me.
给我袋子  打我012--- Joey, Give me the bag. .  Hit me.

不  打我  打我  打我012--- No.  Hit me. Hit me. Hit me!
你闪开了012---You ducked!
我很抱歉  那是本能反应012---I'm sorry! It was a reflex!
噢  天啊  真的好痛012---Oh,my God! This really hurts!
我忍不住就闪开了012---I couldn't help it.

你是怎么回事012---What is the matter with you?
你该本能地闪开才对啊012---You were supposed to duck!
为什么你没闪呢012---Why didn't you?
我们去医院的路上再谈012---Let's talk on the way to the hospital.
好啊  或许等到了医院012---Good. Yeah,maybe while we're there,
可以让医生检查一下你的反射神经012---they can check your reflexes.
再喂她看看  我已经喂过了012--- Try feeding her again.  I already fed her.
我知道  所以我说"再"012---I know. That's why I said,"Again!"
姐妹们  我们不可以窝里反  好吗012---You guys,we can't turn on each other,okay?
那正是她想要的012---That's just what she wants.
我们可以到外面谈谈吗012---Can I talk to you outside?

你可以学习法式烹饪  我可以写作012---And you could study French cooking,and I could write..
我们可以在塞纳河畔野餐012---and we could picnic along the Seine,
去波尔多品酒012---and go winetasting in Bordeaux.
是啊  很好012--- Yeah.  Okay.
你知道有些人说塔尔萨012---You know how people say that Tulsa.
就像是俄克拉荷马州的巴黎吗012---is the Paris of Oklahoma?

那些从没去过巴黎的人说的012---People who have never been to Paris?
到底是怎么回事012---Well,what's going on?
我们要搬去塔尔萨了012---We're moving to Tulsa.
你说什么  好吧012--- Excuse me?  Okay.
麦肯纳小姐  也就是我上司的上司012---Ms. McKenna,she kind of works above my boss.
她要我搬到塔尔萨012---She asked me to move to Tulsa
去当那边分公司的总经理012---and be president of our office there.
我当时正在打瞌睡  迷迷糊糊就答应了012---And I was sleeping and apparently said yes.
俄克拉荷马州的塔尔萨012---Tulsa,Oklahoma?
先锋之州012---The Sooner State.
管他是什么呢012---Whatever that is.
钱德勒012---Chandler,
我连歌舞剧《俄克拉荷马州》 都不想看012---I don't even want to see the musical Oklahoma.
不是吧  "噢  美妙的早晨"012---Really? "Oh,What a Beautiful Morning,"
"挂着流苏的萨里马车"012---"Surrey With the Fringe on Top"?
你是在说我们要搬去俄克拉荷马州012---Are you trying to tell me we're moving to Oklahoma
还是说你是同性恋012---or that you're gay?
好吧  那些都没关系012---All right,not that this matters,
但至少他们有帮你大幅加薪吧012---but did they at least offer you a huge raise?
没有  但是他们会帮我们租一辆福克斯汽车012---No. But they are going to lease us a Ford Focus.
我会试着脱身 谢谢012--- I'll get out of it.  Thank you.

她以为是她要搬到塔尔萨012---She thought she was moving to Tulsa.
请问您现在有空吗012---Ma'am,do you have a minute?
我有些坏消息012---I kind of have some bad news.
我想我不能去塔尔萨了012---I don't think I can move to Tulsa.
什么  事实上  说起来有些好笑012--- What?  It's a funny story,actually.
我在今早的会议上睡着了012---I kind of fell asleep in the meeting this morning.
所以当我说我可以搬到塔尔萨时012---So when I said I'd move to Tulsa,
我根本不知道我在说什么012---I didn't really know what I was saying.
你睡着了012---You fell asleep?
但那是因为我整晚012---But only because I was up all night
为会议担心而失眠012---worried about this meeting.
是不是很好笑呢012---Isn't that funny?
很讽刺  不好笑是吧  好吧012---Irony. Not a fan? All right.
好吧  事情是这样的012---See,here's the thing.
我回家告诉我老婆塔尔萨的事012---I went home and told my wife about Tulsa,

比如  像是罗素012---You know,like Rossell.
或是罗斯托弗012---Or Rosstrophor.
就是罗斯012---Just Ross.
好名字012---It's pretty.

我不认为我们将要在一起012---I don't think that we are.
但是你们两个注定是要在一起的012---But you two are supposed to be together.
我也这样想过012---Well,I thought so too.
但是她却答应要嫁给你012---But then she said she'd marry you.
别这样  罗斯  那根本没什么012---Come on,Ross,that didn't mean anything.
她当时刚生完孩子012---She'd just had the baby.
很恐惧要独自承担未来的重任012---She was freaked out about doing it alone.
任何人求婚  她都会答应的012---She would have said yes to anybody.
是啊  她也是这样说的012---Yeah,that's what she said.
所以呢012---So?
所以我不想做一个随便的存在012---So I don't want to be just anybody.
其实  现在这样也比较好012---You know what? It's better this way anyway.
