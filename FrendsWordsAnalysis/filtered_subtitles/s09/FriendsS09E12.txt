莫妮卡呢  她在家012--- Where's Mon?  She's at home..
布置瑞秋今晚的生日派对012---putting up decorations for Rachel's birthday party tonight.
你不用帮忙吗  我有试过012--- You're not helping?  I tried..
但是  显然012---but apparently
用假音唱《我会活下去》可帮不上忙012---singing "I Will Survive" in a helium voice,not helping.
嘿  你们好  嘿012--- Hey,guys.  Hey.
祝你生日...012---Happy birthday to...
别说那么大声  甘瑟会过来抱我的012---Don't say that loud. Gunther's gonna want to hug me.
好消息  我们终于找到保姆了012---Good news,everyone. We finally found a nanny.
这位是莫莉012---This is Molly.
莫莉  来见过钱德勒  乔伊012---Molly,Chandler,Joey.
有人有点不高兴哦012---Somebody's getting a little fussy.
你说的没错  我就是不高兴012---You're damn right I am.
我已经等饼干等了七分钟了012---I've been waiting for a cookie for seven minutes.
好了  我想我带她出去好了012---Okay. You know what,I'm just gonna take her outside.
不  你留下来  我去012---No,you stay. I'll do it.
好的  谢谢012---Okay. Thank you.
很高兴认识你们  是啊  我们也是012--- Nice to meet you guys.  Yeah,you too.
哇  莫莉真的很不错  是啊012--- Wow,Molly's just great.  Yeah.
是啊  真棒  请了个性感保姆012---Yes,bravo on the hot nanny.
什么 你真觉得她很性感吗012---What? You really think she's hot?
你开什么玩笑012---Are you kidding?
如果我未婚  她现在就在拒绝我了012---If I wasn't married,she'd be rejecting me right now.
乔伊012---Joey?
觉得她的姿势怎样012---How do you think she's doing?
我是唯一不觉得她性感的吗  罗斯012---Am I the only one that doesn't think she's hot? Ross?
我觉得  她不是没有魅力  但是012---I mean,she's not unattractive,but..
但是性感嘛012---but hot?
谢谢你012---Thank you.
瑞秋走了  说吧012---Now that Rachel's gone?
她真性感  我昨晚是哭着入睡的012---So hot,I cried myself to sleep last night.
《老友记》  第九季 第12集  菲比的老鼠012---Friends S09E12 The One With Phoebe's Rats
嘿  麦克  秘鲁的首都是哪里012---Hey,Mike,what's the capital of Peru?
利马  不是012--- Lima.  No.
是V开头X结尾的字012---It starts with a V and ends with an X.
然后最好中间有T和O012---And hopefully with a TO in the middle.
我仔细想想之后012---You know,come to think of it,
秘鲁的首都应该叫"VTOX"012---the capital of Peru is "Vtox."
哦  天啊 怎么了012--- Oh,God!  What?
好了  我不想要吓坏你012---Okay. I don't want to freak you out or anything..
但是我刚在柜子里看到一只老鼠012---but I just saw a rat in your cupboard.
哦  是哦  那是鲍伯012---Oh,yeah. No,that's Bob.
是你的宠物鼠吗012---Well,he's your pet rat?
不太算是  只是偶尔会来拜访012---Well,not so much a pet as,you know,an occasional visitor..
我有时候会喂他  有点像圣诞老人012---who I put food out for. Kind of like Santa.
不过圣诞老人不会在饼干盘里便便012---Except Santa doesn't poop on the plate of cookies.
你不能在公寓里养老鼠012---You can't keep a rat in your apartment.
那很不卫生的012---They're extremely unsanitary.
它们会传染细螺旋体病或是汉滩病毒012---I mean,they transmit leptospirosis and hantavirus.
那是什么  我不知道012---What are those?  I don't know..
但听起来可不像是温泉疗养012---but they don't sound like spa treatments.
你必须处理掉他  好啦012--- You have to get rid of it.  Okay,fine.
如果你这么在乎  我会处理掉鲍伯的012---If it means that much to you,I'll get rid of Bob.
谢谢你012---Thank you.
真奇怪  你觉得他很恶心012---It's so weird you think he's so gross,
却又在吃他的饼干012---yet you're willing to eat his crackers.
加文  我想再次跟你道谢012---Gavin,I just want to say thank you again..
谢谢昨天帮我照顾艾玛012---for watching Emma yesterday during the presentation.
我真的需要跟你道歉012---I really owe you an apology.
道什么歉012---For what?
当我们第一次见面时  你知道的012---When we first met,you know..
我以为你是自负  高傲又讨人厌的人012---I thought you were pompous and arrogant and obnoxious.
你待会儿又得接着道歉吧012---Is this your first apology?
不  我只是想说012---No,I just mean,you know,
第一印象通常不是很重要的012---first impressions don't mean anything.
而我认为你是个好男人012---And I think you're a really good guy.
很抱歉我错看了你012---And I'm sorry that I misjudged you.
早安  嗨012--- Morning.  Hello.
我想说  新的一天  新的开始012---But you know what? Hey,new day,new leaf.
我只是真的很高兴012---I am just really,really happy..
我很抱歉  显然012---I'm sorry. Obviously,
海瑟的屁股有更重要的事要对你说012---Heather's ass has something more important to say..
我先让它说完好了012---so I'll just wait till it's finished.
什么  我正在跟你道歉012--- What?  I was giving you an apology..
而你一直在打量她012---and you were totally checking her out.
我没有  我在时装业工作012---I wasn't. I'm in fashion.
我只是在看她的裙子012---I was looking at her skirt.
貌似是裤子吧  我并没有看清楚012---Or was it pants? I didn't really see
屁股以下的部位012---what happened below the ass area.
哇  你真的是  你真恶心012---Wow,you are really.. You're really a creep.
就算我是在看她  你又在乎什么呢012---What do you care if I was looking at her?
你是在忌妒吗012---Are you jealous?
哦  是啊  我好忌妒012---Oh,yeah. I'm jealous.
"哦  加文  拜托请看看我的屁股"012---"Oh,Gavin. Please,please look at my ass."
不要看我的屁股012---Stop looking at my ass!
我只是认为这样的行为是不妥的012---I mean,I just think you are totally inappropriate. Okay?
这是工作场所  她是你下属012---This is a work environment. She's your subordinate.
但你跟你前助理泰格上床就可以吗012---But it was okay when you slept with your old assistant,Tag?
那完全不一样  原因有二012---That is totally different for two reasons.
一  我不知道你知道那件事012---One: I didn't know that you knew that.
二  我不是盯着他屁股看的恶心人012---And two: I wasn't some creep staring at his ass.
我们有很深入  有意义的交往012---We had a.. We had a deep,meaningful relationship.
泰格姓什么012---What was Tag's last name?
是...012---It was..
哦  我的天012---Oh,my God.
他没有  他没有 他没有姓012---He didn't.. He didn't.. He didn't have a last name.
就叫泰格而已  就像雪儿  或是012---It was just Tag,you know,like Cher or..
摩西012---you know,Moses.
但那是很深入  有意义的交往012---But it was a deep,meaningful relationship.
好吧  我对你的第一印象完全正确012---You know what? My first impression of you was absolutely right.
你高傲  又自负012---You are arrogant. You are pompous.
摩根  摩根012---Morgan! Morgan!
泰格姓摩根 是琼斯012--- Tag's last name was Morgan!  It was Jones.
你是谁啊  他男朋友吗012---What are you,his boyfriend?
天啊  我希望我有个像你一样的保姆012---Man,I wish I had a nanny like you.
你是说你小时候吗012---You mean when you were a baby?
当然012---Sure.
你可不可以别再盯着她看012---Would you stop staring at her?
我没有盯着012---I wasn't staring.
我是斜眼瞄着012---I was leering.
她有什么了不起的呢012---What's the big deal with her?
或许她有很抢眼的魅力012---Maybe she's attractive in an obvious kind of way.
是啊  抢眼的魅力最糟糕了012---Yeah,obvious beauty's the worst.
你知道的  当它就显现在你面前时012---You know,when it's right there in your face.
我比较喜欢渐渐去发掘一个人的魅力012---Me,I like to have to work to find someone attractive.
让我感觉像是我辛苦得来的012---Makes me feel like I earned it.
看起来乔伊好像跟她处的不错012---Looks like Joey's doing all right with her.
是啊  你们两个这次愿意退让出012---Yeah. Hey,that was nice of you guys to back off..
让乔伊去泡她  真是好心012---and let Joey get the girl for once.
我要带她回去了012---I'm gonna take her to the apartment.
好的  我下班之后就回去012---Okay. I'll be home right after work.
好的 好的  艾玛  再见012--- Okay.  Okay,bye,Emma.
我爱你012---I love you.
再见 再见012--- Bye.  Bye.
他们推选我来跟你说012---They've elected me to talk to you
你模仿婴儿说话的事012---about the baby talk.
大家不是很喜欢012---It's not so good.
我觉得挺可爱的012---I think it's sweet.
再见  艾玛012---Bye,Emma!
嘿  乔伊  关于莫莉012---Hey,listen,Joey. About Molly,
我希望你不要去动她012---I would really prefer if you didn't go after her.
为什么不行012---Why not?
因为我们花了好几个月才找到好保姆012---It took months to find a good nanny.
而我不希望有任何事情让她离开012---And I wouldn't want anything to,you know,drive her away.
所以你认为我只会跟她上床012---So you think I'm just gonna sleep with her..
之后就不再打电话给她012---and never call her again,
让一切都变得很尴尬吗012---and things are gonna get uncomfortable?
是啊  听起来好像也对012---Yeah,that sounds about right.
别这样  外面到处都是女人012---Come on,there are plenty of other women out there.
别打她的主意  不可以碰她012---Just forget about her,okay? She's offlimits.
天啊  你为什么要这样说呢012---Oh,man! What'd you have to go and say that for?
你越说我不可以碰她012---Now that you told me I can't have her,
我就越想要她了012---makes me want her even more!
你还是小孩啊  是的012--- What are you,a child?  Yes!
听着  乔伊  别这样  为了我  拜托012---Look,Joey,come on now. For me,please.
把你的性能量转移到别人身上012---Just try to focus your sexual energy on someone else.
好啦012---Fine.
带我回家吧012---Take me home.
嘿  麦克  嘿  菲比012--- Hey,Mikey.  Hey,Phoebe.
你在做什么呢  放捕鼠器012--- What are you doing?  Setting rattraps.
要杀鲍伯吗012---To kill Bob?
不是  只是测试一下他脖子有多硬012---No. No,to test his neck strength.
不  我不想杀死他012---No,I don't want to kill him.
我以为我们要活抓他012---I thought we were gonna capture him..
然后到乡下把他放生012---and,you know,set him free in the countryside..
让他可以认识友善的负鼠012---where he could meet a friendly possum..
或是爱说笑的猫头鹰012---and a wisecracking owl.
好了  我把捕鼠器丢掉012---Okay,okay. I'll throw away the traps.
好  我会找到鲍伯  我会抓到他的012---All right,I'll find Bob. I'll get him.
鲍伯  鲍伯012---Bob? Bob?
罗伯特012---Robert?
等等  我听到他的声音了012---Wait,I think I hear him.
天啊  鲍伯生小孩了 鲍伯当妈妈了012---Oh,my God! Bob had babies! Bob's a mom!
我们得替她改名字了012---We'll have to think of a new name.
我不知道  我喜欢"鲍伯"当女生名字012---I don't know,I kind of like "Bob" for a girl.
不不  我是说我不确定我们012---No,no. I mean,I'm not sure that we..
天啊  我们杀了鲍伯吗012---Oh,my God. We killed Bob?
或许不是鲍伯  或许只是只老鼠012---Well,maybe it wasn't Bob. Maybe it was a mouse.
苏西012---Susie?
怎么样012---What's up?
说真的  老兄  三年了012---Seriously,dude. Three years ago.
听着  你可以帮我一个忙吗012---Listen,can you do me a favor?
我今天要出去012---I'm gonna be out today.
你可以帮我看着乔伊012---Can you keep an eye on Joey..
确保他跟莫莉之间不会出事吗012---make sure nothing happens between him and Molly?
你不相信他吗  不相信012--- You don't trust him?  Well,no.
有个听起来很像乔伊声音的女人012---Some woman who sounded a lot like Joey
之前打电话来012---called earlier..
要找她称之为"性感保姆"的女儿012---and asked for her daughter,the "hot nanny."
你打算让我长期干预他们吗012---Is this your longterm plan,for me to run interference?
我可能随时都会找到工作的012---Because I could get a job any day now.
你在某些方面真是拔尖人才012---You do appear right on the cusp of something.
听着  拜托  老兄012---Look,come on,man.
我确定他一两星期后就会没兴趣了012---I'm sure he'll lose interest in a week or two..
但是目前  你可以帮我这个忙吗012---but for now,could you please just do this for me?
好啦  但是如果失败可别怪我哦012---Fine,but don't blame me if it doesn't work.
因为你也了解  乔伊一旦下定决心012---Because you know once Joey sets his mind on something..
无论如何  他都会把她搞上手的012---more often than not,he's going to have sex with it.
那我们得要做点什么  不是吗012---Well,I mean,we've gotta do something. Okay?
她那样的保姆可不是树上凭空长出来的012---Nannies like her don't grow on trees.
在想像那棵树吗  是的  没错012--- Picturing that tree?  I am,yes.
你要去哪  乔012---Where you going,Joe?
去散步012---For a walk.
我也去好吗012---You mind if I join you?
事实上  我想要一个人去012---Actually,I'd rather be alone.
我真的需要理清一些想法012---You know,I really need to organize my thoughts.
一"些"想法012---Your thoughts?
复数的012---Plural?
好啦  我只有一个想法012---All right,fine. I only have one thought.
就是关于那个性感保姆  我必须见到她012---It's about the hot nanny! I gotta see her!
恐怕我不能让你去  乔伊012---I'm afraid I can't let you do that,Joe.
你是说我不能见她012---Now you're saying I can't see her?
你简直让我生不如死012---You're killing me!
她就像是禁果  就像是...012---She's forbidden fruit! It's like,like..
她是公主  而我是马童012---like she's the princess and I'm the stable boy.
为什么你要这样012---Why are you doing this,huh?
是不是罗斯要你别让我过去的呢012---Did Ross tell you not to let me go over there?
没错  事实上的确如此012---Yes,as a matter of fact,he did.
所以我不能让你过去012---So I can't let you go.
有趣  现在出现挡路的了012---Interesting. Now there are obstacles.
性感保姆和我一起抵抗全世界012---Hot nanny and me against the world!
伟大的爱情小说就源自类似的生活故事012---This is the stuff great novels are made of.
伟大的爱情小说?012---Great novels?

我有个问题必须要问你012---I have a question I need to ask you.
妈  我再回电给你  是的012---Mom,I'll call you later. Yeah.
怎样  如果你那么喜欢看屁股012--- Yes?  If you like looking at butts so much..
你何不自己去照镜子呢012---why don't you just go look in a mirror?
感谢上帝  你终于说了012---Thank God you finally said that.
三小时前我就看到你写在笔记本上了012---I saw you make a note on your pad three hours ago.
天啊  我真的惹你厌  是不是012---Man,I really bug you. Don't I?
哦  不  拜托012---Oh,no. Please..
我根本不在乎你  更别提讨厌你012---I don't care about you enough to bug me.

我非常能干的同事  而且更重要的是012---to my very talented colleague and more importantly..
我的好朋友  加文·米奇012---my wonderful friend,Gavin Mitchell.
幸会  幸会012--- Pleased to meet you.  Pleased to meet you.
你会来参加瑞秋的派对吗012---Are you coming to Rachel's party?
哦  不不不不012---Oh,no,no,no,no.
加文去不成  他已经有计划了012---Gavin can't. He already has plans..
应该是要去看他妈妈012---most likely with his mother.
我不介意  我可以取消012---I don't mind. I'll cancel them.
我不想错过我秘书的生日012---I would never miss my secretary's birthday.
为什么你要邀请他012---Why did you invite him?
我无法忍受那个男的012---I can't stand that guy!
你看起来跟他很好啊012---You were being so nice to him.
我是装出来的012---I was faking it.
你难道看不出来我是装的吗012---Can't you tell when I'm being fake?
嘿  菲利浦先生  西装真帅012---Hey,Mr. Phillips. Nice suit.
抓到了  装出来的恭维话012---Right there. That was so fake!
我真不敢相信  你邀请了加文012---I still can't believe you invited Gavin.
他是我最不想见到的人012---He is just the last person I want to see.
"不用谢我帮你办派对"012---You're welcome for the party.
我很高兴你玩得开心012---I'm glad you're having a good time.
我希望他不要出现012---I hope he doesn't show up.
他当然不会  他讨厌我012---Of course he won't,the guy hates me.
是吗  什么012--- Does he?  What?
或许他一直惹你生气  是因为喜欢你012---Maybe he keeps bothering you so much because he likes you.
就像在小学一年级的时候012---It's like in first grade
斯库普·郎把我推倒在操场上012---when Skippy Lange would always push me on the playground
其实是因为他在暗恋我012---because he secretly had a crush on me.
莫妮卡  你以为斯库普喜欢你吗012---Monica,you think Skippy liked you?
亲爱的  所有的男生都在打赌012---Honey,all those boys had a bet
看他是不是有办法撂倒你012---to see if he could knock you over.
她睡了  我带她回去012---She's out. I'm gonna take her home.
好的  谢谢012---Okay. Thank you.
再见  甜心012---Bye,sweetheart.
男人都觉得她很有魅力  你有发现吗012---Do you see what all the guys see in her?
至少不会想踢她下床012---Wouldn't kick her out of bed.
我不可以再喝伏特加了012---No more vodka for me.
嘿  瑞秋012---Hey,Rach.
现在可以唱生日快乐歌了吗012---So can I sing "Happy Birthday" to you now?
当然可以 好的012--- Yeah,sure.  All right.
祝你生日...012---Happy birthday to....
待会见012---See you later.
瑞秋  有人送你鞋子012---Hey,Rach. Somebody got you shoes.
快给我看012---Give me!
哇哇  我的天啊  小心小心012--- Wow. Wow. Oh,my God!  Careful! Careful!
里面是我的老鼠宝宝012---These are my rat babies!
是啊  我们现在有老鼠宝宝了012---Yeah. We have rat babies now.
你带老鼠来参加我的生日派对012---You brought rats to my birthday party?
原来中风是这种感觉啊012---So this is what a stroke feels like.
我必须要带着他们  我们杀了他们的妈012---Well,I had to bring them. We killed their mother.
他们现在是我们的责任了012---They're our responsibility now.
你知道的  他们需要一直被照顾012---You know,they require constant care.
你应该知道的  瑞秋  你自己也是母亲012---You should know that, Rachel, you're a mother.
你把我女儿跟一只老鼠做比较012---Are you comparing my daughter to a rat?
不  是七只012---No. Seven rats.
我们应该带他们回家了012---We should take them home.
他们需要吃东西了012---We need to feed them.
你竟然要离开我的派对012---You're gonna leave my party
回去照顾一盒老鼠012---to take care of a box of rats?
嗯  我很抱歉  瑞秋012---Well,I'm sorry,Rachel,
但是我不像你  好吗012---but I'm not like you. Okay?
不是每个人都请得起保姆的012---Not everyone can afford help.
嘿  乔伊跟莫莉去哪了012---Hey,where the hell are Joey and Molly?
我要你看住他们的012---I asked you to watch them.
我很抱歉  我有点分心了012---I'm sorry. I got a little preoccupied.
听着  我们及时阻止他们  以免出事012---Look,we have to stop them before something happens.
我会追随你的  大哥012---Right behind you,big guy.
所以你瞧  莫莉  人们不了解012---So you see,Molly,what people don't understand..
演戏也是一门学科012---is that acting is a discipline.
需要很辛苦的学习和付出012---It takes a lot of hard work.
所以你是在哪里学的012---So where'd you study?
我没有上过大学012---I didn't go to college.
那  是从哪里学会演戏的呢012---No,where'd you study acting?
莫莉  演戏不是学来的012---Molly,people don't study acting.

我不知道012---I'm not sure.
