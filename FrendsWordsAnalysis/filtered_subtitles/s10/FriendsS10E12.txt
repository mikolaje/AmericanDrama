喔，嘿，乔伊012---- Oh, hey, Joey. - Mmm.
- 你好 - 听着，我有件事要问你012---- Hey. - Listen, I need to ask you something.
你知道我继父在坐牢012---You know how my stepdad's in prison?
- 知道 - 好012---- Yeah. - Yeah.
本来周末他可以放假 来参加明天的婚礼012---He was supposed to get a weekend furlough so he could go to the wedding.
可是他刚刚打电话来…012---But he just called and...
看来刺杀其他犯人的活动 不能等到星期一才办012---Well, apparently stabbing Iceman in the exercise yard couldn't wait till Monday.
- 所以他不能来？ - 对012---- So he can't come? - No.
所以没有人陪我走过走道，然后…012---And so there's no one to walk me down the aisle. And...
如果你能陪我，我会很开心012---Well, I would just really love it if you would do it.
- 你说真的？ - 当然012---- Seriously? - Yeah.
你待我就跟父亲一样012---You've, you know, sort of been like a dad to me.
我是说，你一直很照顾我 也常和我分享生活智慧012---You've always, you know, looked out for me and shared your wisdom.
我的确很有〝雅慧〞012---I am pretty "wisdomous."
你愿意吗？012---So, what do you say?
你开玩笑吗？菲比，这是我的荣幸012---Are you kidding? Phoebe, I would be honored.
谢谢012---PHOEBE: Oh, thank you.
我希望…012---I hope...
我希望你了解 你对我有多重要012---I hope you know how much you mean to me.
听着，我也希望…012---Listen, I hope...
我也希望你知道…012---I hope that you know...
不能让你看见老爸哭，回房间去012---I don't want you to see your father cry. Go to your room!
《老友记》  第十季  第12集  菲比的婚礼012---Friends S10E12 The One With Phoebe's Wedding
不必了…老爸请客012---- Oh. - Oh, no, no, no. Let your dad get this.
又是我的婚礼策划人 她快把我搞疯了012---Oh. It's my wedding planner. She's driving me crazy!
喂？不要尖叫012---Hello? Okay, stop screaming!
好，那就比目鱼012---Okay, so halibut.
好，那就换鲑鱼 随便，我不知道…012---All right, so salmon. Either way. I don't...
- 我不在乎 - 可是我在乎012---- It doesn't matter to me. - Well, it matters to me!
我不在乎，你选就好012---Well, I don't care. So you pick.
你刚刚挂我电话吗？012---Did you just hang up on me?
听着，我要你在1800时 到晚餐预演012---All right, look, I need you at the rehearsal dinner tonight at 1800 hours.
好…那是几点？012---Okay. What time is that?
你听不懂军事时间代码？012---You don't know military time?
那天我正好在接受导弹训练012---I must have been in missile training the day they taught that.
减掉12012---Just subtract 12.
好，1800减12…012---Okay, so 1800 minus 12...
就是1788012---...is 1788.
- 六点 - 好012---- Six o'clock! - Okay.
等等…我是盖勒012---Hold on. Yeah? Geller here.
不，我说四点就要送达，再见012---No, I said it has to be there by 4:00. Goodbye.
做个冰雕是有多难？012---How hard is it to make an ice sculpture?
冰雕？这样太隆重了012---That sounds really fancy.
我说只要简单的婚礼就好012---I told you, I just want a simple wedding.
拜托，甜心，细节交给我就好012---Please, honey, leave the details to me.
我会竭尽所能让你成到宾至如归012---Now, I wanna make this day as special for you as I can.
我想让竖琴师穿白色012---I was thinking the harpist should wear white.
竖琴师？我朋友玛洁莉 不是要打钢鼓？012---Harpist? My friend Marjorie is playing the steel drums.
- 她退出了 - 真的？为什么？012---- Oh, she backed out. - She did? Why?
我逼她的012---I made her.
钢鼓并不适合典雅的婚礼012---Steel drums don't really say "elegant wedding."
- 还有玛洁莉浓郁的体味 - 听好012---- Nor does Marjorie's overwhelming scent. - Hey!
等西藏独立后，她自然会洗澡012---She will shower when Tibet is free.
- 嘿，你看起来真美 - 你也不错012---CHANDLER: Hey. You look great. PHOEBE: You too.
很高兴能来晚餐彩排 很少有机会用赛前先试吃012---I'm glad we're having a rehearsal dinner. I rarely practice my meals before I eat.
你忘记你要送我们的礼物了吗？012---What did we say was your one gift to us?
不说冷笑话 可是不是要等正式婚礼再说？012---No stupid jokes, but I thought that was for the actual wedding.
先彩排012---Rehearse it.
你好012---Hi.
- 谢谢你们来 - 对…012---- Thanks for coming, you guys. - Oh, yeah...
我本来…要跟你握手的012---I was... I was going for a handshake.
所以你的手抵住我的胯下？012---That why your hand's against my crotch?
- 没错 - 好012---- That is why. MIKE: Yeah.
瑞秋，艾玛在哪？012---So, Rach, where's Emma?
摩妮卡逼我把她托我妈带012---Monica made me send her to my mom's.
因为小婴儿不适合参加婚礼012---Apparently, babies and weddings don't mix.
你还在为那死小鬼抱怨吗？012---Are you still crying about your damn baby?
菲比，你要让队伍继续动 切记，一人二十秒012---Pheebs, you got to keep the line moving. Remember, 20 seconds per person.
这些小丑，你每天都见得到012---You see these clowns all the time.
- 你们是麦克的父母，对吧？ - 是的012---- Hey, you're Mike's parents, right? - Yes, we are.
孩子们长得真快，不是吗？012---Gosh, our little ones are growing up fast, aren't they?
- 什么意思？ - 你知道的…012---- How's that? - You know...
虽然很替他们高兴 但要放手却也很难012---...on one hand, you're happy for them. On the other, it's hard to let go.
你到底是谁？012---Who in God's name are you?
我也不是很喜欢你，老兄 我是看在孩子的份上给你面子012---I'm not that fond of you either, buddy. I'm just trying to be nice for the kids.
对了，我们还不知道 明天在婚礼中要负责的工作012---You know what? We have no idea what we're doing in the wedding tomorrow.
我们应该要当伴郎的 怎么还不跟我们说？012---I thought we'd be groomsmen. They would have asked us by now.
他们什么时候请你当伴娘的？012---When did they ask you to be a bridesmaid?
- 11月 - 看来情况不妙012---- November. - I wanna say it's not looking good.
- 菲比？ - 怎么了？012---- Hey, Pheebs? - Huh?
你还没分配他们在婚礼的工作012---You haven't told these guys what they're doing in the wedding yet.
这个…他们不必参与婚礼的工作012---Um, well, they're not in the wedding.
什么？012---What?
那么…012---Well...
好尴尬012---...this is really awkward.
对了，我可以离开012---Oh, and I can leave.
抱歉，两位，麦克有哥哥和同学012---I'm sorry, you guys. But Mike's got his brother and his friends from school.
所以你们…012---So, you know, you were...
其实，你们是备取 差一点就当成了012---If it helps, you were next in line. You just missed the cut.
天啊012---Oh, man.
这像是花式溜冰队的噩梦又重演了012---This is like figure skating team all over again.
我是说水上芭蕾012---I mean, synchronized swimming.
我是说…平衡木012---I mean... I mean, the balance beam.
- 救救我 - 美式足球012---- Help me. - Football.
威谢你012---Thank you.
菲比，快吐出来，里面有猪肉012---Oh, Pheebs, spit that out. That has pork in it.
哦！哦！012---Oh! Oh!
我以为锅贴不是素食的吗？012---I thought the pot stickers were supposed to be vegetarian?
对，我换掉了，我有传真通知你012---Yeah, I changed them. I sent you a fax about it.
我没有传真机012---I don't have a fax machine.
那么接下来会有更多惊喜012---Huh. Well, then there are gonna be a few surprises.
想不到我们是唯一 无法参与婚礼工作的人012---I can't believe we're gonna be the only people not in the wedding.
- 我了解，我讨厌遭到冷落 - 更何况是婚礼012---- I know. I hate being left out of things. - And it's a wedding.
我没份才真是诡异012---It'll be weird if I'm not in it.
- 各位，你们好吗？ - 很好012---- Hey, guys, how's it going? - Fine.
我们闲着没事坐在这儿 为明天要做的事彩排012---We're sitting here, alone, doing nothing. It's our rehearsal for tomorrow.
听着，关于明天我有件事要问你们012---Look, about tomorrow, I've got a question for you.
我刚发现 其中一个伴郎有急事不能来012---I found out one of my groomsmen had an emergency and can't make it.
- 出了什么事？ - 谁管他？然后呢？012---- What happened? - Who cares? And?
我在想也许你们其中一个人…012---And I was wondering if one of you guys...
- 我来 - 我要012---- I'll do it! - Me!
你们都想当？可是只有一个空缺012---You both wanna do it? There's only room for one.
选我，我穿礼服很师 但不会抢走你们的风采012---Pick me. I look great in a tux, and I won't steal focus.
不…麦克，应该选我，你瞧012---No, Mike. No, no, you wanna pick me. I mean... Watch.
啊哈？012---Huh?
我觉得由我决定不太妥当012---You know, I really don't feel very comfortable making this decision.
菲比跟你们比较熟，我请她选好了012---You know, Phoebe knows you better. I'm gonna let her choose.
如果让菲比选 那就见过麦克的新伴郎吧012---Well, if Phoebe's choosing, then say hello to Mike's next groomsman.
当然，可是我需要镜子…012---Oh, I will. But I will need a mirror...
因为就是在下012---...as he is me.
- 得了吧，你死定了 - 你才死透了012---- Please. You're going down. - You are going "downer."
花式溜冰队的人都这么说话吗？012---They say that on the figure skating team?
我不知道，我根本没入选012---I wouldn't know. I didn't make it.
你知道我明天要 代替菲比的继父吧？012---You know I'm filling in for Phoebe's stepdad tomorrow, right?
- 对，感谢你的帮忙 - 我乐意之至012---- Yeah. Yeah. Hey, thanks for doing that. - Oh, hey, my pleasure.
你对我的菲比有何意图？012---So, what are your intentions with my Phoebe?
- 我意图娶她为妻 - 耍嘴皮子012---- I intend to marry her. - Oh, a wiseacre.
我还听说你打算以弹钢琴维持家计？012---I understand you plan to support your wife by playing the piano?
这样收入不会不稳定吗？012---Isn't that kind of unstable?
- 应该比演戏好 - 两好球012---- No more so than acting. - Strike two.
你说得对，可能要她养我012---You're right. She probably will support me.
不如搬去和你住吧？爸012---Hey, unless we move in with you, Dad.
三好球012---Strike three.
你只剩一次机会，麦克012---You only get one more, Mike.
你决定如何？012---So? What did you decide?
我决定去上厕所012---I decided to pee.
麦克没跟你说吗？你得从我们之中 选出一个人参加婚礼012---You have to choose one of us to be in your wedding.
- 有- 个伴郎不能来 - 不行…012---- One of the groomsmen fell out. - Oh, no, no.
我不能从你们俩选择，我爱你们俩012---I can't choose between you two. I love you both so much.
所以我们原本才不能参与婚礼012---Just not enough to put us in the original wedding party.
可是我不想选，这…012---But I don't wanna choose. It's...
- 等等，瑞秋？ - 什么？012---- Okay, wait. Rach? - Yeah?
听着，我有个伴娘的特殊任务 要交给你012---Listen, I have a very special bridesmaid task for you to do.
太好了，是什么？012---Goody! What is it?
现在有一个伴郎的空缺012---Well, there's a spot open for only one groomsman...
你要从罗斯和钱德其中择一 祝你好运012---...and you have to choose between Ross and Chandler. So good luck with that.
什么…？我不想选012---What? What, what, what? No, I don't wanna do that.
看来我得找新伴娘了012---I guess I have to find a new bridesmaid.
我来当012---I'll do it!
现在已经2 1 00了012---Okay, it's 2100 hours.
- 该敬酒了 - 我可以去上厕所吗？012---- Time for your toast. - Do I have time to go to the bathroom?
你在2030有上厕所时间 请遵守时问表，麦克012---You had a bathroom break at 2030. Pee on your own time, Mike.
敬酒致词要简短012---In regards to the toasts, okay, you wanna keep them short.
冗长致词是晚餐彩排的一大杀手012---Nothing kills a rehearsal dinner like long speeches. Okay.
只要进去办完正事就出来012---You just get in, do your thing, and get out.
你对钱德都这么说吗？012---Is that what you say to Chandler?
已经2 1 01了，我并不高兴012---It's 2101, and I am not amused.
好的012---Okay.
新郎新娘有几句话要说012---The bride and groom have a few words they'd like to say.
各位，大家好012---Okay. Hello, everyone.
威谢各位今晚的到来 明天就是大喜之日了012---And thank you all for being here tonight. So tomorrow's the big event.
有些人也许不知道麦克和我 一开始并没有看对眼012---Some of you might not know, but Mike and I didn't get off to the best start.
对，我朋友乔伊和我…012---Yeah. My friend Joey and I...
本来想替对方介绍对象，所以我…012---...decided to fix each other up with friends. So I...
好吧，我…012---Oh, okay. I...
所以我把他介绍给我朋友玛莉艾伦012---I thought about it, and I fixed him up with my friend Mary Ellen...
她今晚不克前来，因为…其实…012---...who couldn't be here tonight, because... It's not...
其实不重要，她人在戒毒中心012---It's not important. Well, she's in rehab.
总之，乔伊说要把他朋友 麦克介绍给我012---Anyway. So Joey said that he was fixing me up with his friend Mike...
可是他没有叫麦克的朋友 所以借用我的麦克012---...only he didn't have a friend Mike, so he just brought my Mike. And... And...
然后…012---[CLEARS THROAT]
但结果…却是好的012---But despite, you know... It got good.
我想趁此机会谈我无法到来的母亲012---I wanna take a moment to mention my mother, who couldn't be here.
天啊012---Oh, God.
机会没了012---And... And moment's over.
好…这个跳过012---So okay... Oh, no, forget that.
这也跳过…这梱好笑012---I can forget that. Oh, this is funny.
可是要先说这个才听得懂012---Oh, but you need to know that to get that.
那么…好…012---So... Oh, well, okay.
我…好…012---I... Okay.
摩妮卡，我受不了了！012---Okay, Monica, I can't do it like this!
这是我的婚礼好吗？我不要这个…012---This is my wedding, okay? I don't want this...
或是这掴…还有这个…012---Or this... Or this...
可以吗？我只要一个简单的婚礼012---Okay? I just wanted a simple wedding...
而且我的未婚夫 随时想上厕所都可以！012---...where my fiancé can go to the bathroom any time he wants!
- 算了，我不要你了 - 什么？012---- You know what? You're done. - What?
你被炒鱿′鱼了！012---You're fired!
干杯012---Cheers.
- 嘿 - 大喜之日快乐012---- Hey. - Happy wedding day.
祝你我的大喜之日快乐012---Happy my wedding day to you.
乔伊，这里要当伴娘休息室012---Joey, listen, this is gonna be bridesmaid central, all right?
所以厕所袒会有人梳发，上化妆品012---We're gonna have hair and makeup in the bathroom.
我空出冰箱一些空间放胸花012---I had to move a couple things in the fridge to make room for the corsages.
可恶，早知道有胸花吃 我就不吃早赛了012---Man! I wouldn't have had breakfast if I knew there was gonna be corsages.
嗨012---Hi.
关于昨晚…012---About last night...
我知道你压力很大…012---I know you're under a lot of stress, and...
虽然你的话有点伤人…012---Well, even though the things you said hurt me a little bit...
我的重点是…012---My point is...
我希望你让我继续工作012---Well, I'm willing to take my job back.
没关系012---Oh, well, that's okay.
我觉得你只当伴娘 你我会处得比较好012---I think you and I will do much better if you're just here as a bridesmaid.
是这样吗？012---Oh, is that so?
好吧012---Okay.
既然如此，拿去012---If that's really what you want, then here.
耳机给你，但是我不想给你耳机012---I give you the headset. I don't really wanna give you the headset.
既然你要自己处理 那就要回覆这些留言012---I guess if you're taking over, then you should probably return these messages.
这么多012---- This is a lot. - Uh-huh.
我相信你可以应付 虽然我的组织能力012---But I'm sure you can handle this. I have won awards...
曾经得过奖，但我相信你应付得来012---...for my organizational skills. But I'm sure you'll do fine.
- 你得过奖？ - 我全都用电脑列印出来012---- You've won awards? - I printed them out on my computer.
- 嘿 - 嗨012---- Hey. - Hi.
- 瑞秋在哪？ - 房问里，怎么了？012---- Where's Rach? - She's in her room. Why?
我要跟她谈伴郎的事012---I have to talk to her about this groomsman situation.
我不要像呆瓜一样坐在那看着钱德012---I'm not gonna watch Chandler up there while I'm in the seats like some chump.
老天啊，你真是明艳动人012---My God, you're breathtaking.
你想干嘛？012---What do you want?
你不会已经选出伴郎人选了吧？012---You haven't by any chance chosen a groomsman yet, have you?
罗斯，不要再给我压力了012---Ross, please don't make this harder than it already is.
我不会，我让你轻松点，选我就好012---I'm not. I'm making it easier. Pick me.
钱德也说这对他意义重大012---- Chandler said it's important to him too. - Listen. Listen.
听我说…012---Whoever you pick is gonna walk down the aisle with you.
我保证不会说话 可是如果你选钱德012---Now, I promise I won't say a word. But if you pick Chandler...
他会不停在你耳边说冷笑话012---...he's gonna be whispering stupid jokes in your ear the whole time.
两个烂苹果，你比较不烂012---Oh, you are the lesser of two evils.
太好了012---Yes!
史文，我听不懂你的话 你说花怎么了？012---Sven, I don't understand what you're saying. What is wrong with the flowers?
〝烂话〞？〝烂话〞到底是什么？012---"Lorkins"? What the hell are "lorkins"?
我知道012---I know.
- 你们好 - 麦克，如果你是瑞典人012---- Hey. - Mike, if you were Swedish...
然后你说〝烂话〞 那会是什么花？012---...and you were saying the word "lorkins," what flower would that be?
- 兰花？ - 没错012---- Orchids? - Right there!
难怪我要嫁给你012---That's why I'm marrying you.
你好，麦克012---Hello, Michael.
乔瑟夫012---Joseph.
借一步说话好吗？012---May I have a word with you, please?
这里真…012---This is...
不错012---...great.
请坐012---Have a seat.
昨晚…012---Last night...
我试着欢迎你加入我的家族012---...I tried to welcome you into my family.
反之，你却不尊重我012---And instead, you disrespect me.
此举我绝不允许012---I cannot allow this.
你在为一部烂黑帮电影彩排吗？012---Are you rehearsing for some really bad Mafia movie?
又给我回嘴012---More back talk.
没错，我的确引用最近 失败的试镜台词012---And yes, I may be borrowing a few lines from my recent unsuccessful audition...
《家族荣耀2：打开天窗说亮话》012---...for Family Honor 2: This A-Time It's A-Personal.
乔伊，我今天有点忙 你到底要说什么？012---Joey, I kind of have a lot to do today. What do you want?
我要你认真看待此事012---I want you to take this seriously!
菲比对我而官非常重要012---Phoebe is very, very important to me, okay?
我要确定你能照顾她012---I wanna make sure you are gonna take care of her.
乔伊，我爱菲比012---Joe, I love Phoebe.
她是我一生最重要的人012---She's the most important thing in my life.
我死也不会让她受伤害012---I'd die before I let anything happen to her.
这才是我想听的012---That's what I wanted to hear.
因为她是我的家人012---Because she's family, okay?
现在你也即将加入我们012---And now you're gonna be family.
世界上最重要的莫过于家人012---And there's nothing more important in the whole world than family.
这部电影一定很糟012---That must have been one lousy movie.
这是我说的012---That was me!
- 嗨 - 嘿，我可以跟你谈伴郎的事吗？012---- Hi. - Let's talk about this groomsman thing.
你选罗斯的话 他会安然陪你走完走道012---If you pick Ross, he'll walk you down the aisle just fine.
可是你选我的话012---But if you choose me...
你就有笑话听了012---...you'll be getting some comedy.
虽然如此…012---Even so...
我想我会选罗斯012---...I think I'm gonna pick Ross.
好吧012---Okay.
我小时候，总是受冷落012---See, when I was a kid, you know, I was always left out of everything...
这让我很没有安全感012---...and it really made me feel insecure.
体育课总是没人要我012---I was always picked last in gym...
连那个不懂棒球规则的 胖交换学生都有人要012---...even behind that fat exchange student who didn't know the rules to baseball.
那家伙被三振出局还往三垒跑012---I mean, this guy would strike out and then run to third.
总之，如果我是唯一 无法参与婚礼的人012---Anyway, if I'm the only one left out of this wedding...
那些不好的回忆一定又会涌上心头012---...I just know that all those feelings are gonna come rushing back.
好吧，我选你012---All right, fine, I pick you.
好极了012---Yes!
伴郎钱德来也012---Make "groom" for Chandler.
天啊012---Oh, my.
不，照我的方式做 因为你的方式很蠢012---No, we're gonna do it my way. Because your way is stupid.
好吧，我得挂了 我还有电话，牧师012---All right, I got to go. I have another call, Reverend.
喂？012---Hello?
- 很高兴我们谈开了 - 没错012---- I'm glad we had this little talk. - Yes.
谢谢你给我新婚之夜的指点012---And thanks for all the wedding night advice.
我听完成到很自在012---That didn't make me uncomfortable at all.
好吧，各位今晚见了012---All right, so I'll see everybody tonight.
- 好 - 再见012---- Okay. - Bye.
