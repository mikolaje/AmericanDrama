谁是阿曼达012---Who's Amanda?
你搬进来之前012---She's this girl who lived in the building

后来她搬去英国了012---Then she moved to England

你这么做过吗012---Have you ever done that?

所以  闭上眼睛012---so close your eyes.
喷淋停止的时候  数五下012---When the spraying stops, count to five...
轻轻拍打自己防止出现液体流下的痕迹012---...pat yourself to avoid drip marks,
然后转身我们就可以喷你背后了  明白了012---then turn to get your back. Got it?
喷  数  轻拍  然后转012---Spray, count, pat and turn.
喷  数  轻拍012---Spray, count and pat.

你最好让它前后一样了012---You'll wanna even that out.
是吧012---Really?
你可能要再进去一次012---You might wanna get back in there.
好吧012---Oh, okay!

后面墙上没有灯012---there's no light on the back wall.
我怎么知道它什么时候开始  有人吗012---How do I know when it's gonna start? Hello?

要我们帮她看孩子012---asking if someone could babysit again.

我一只手就能解开012---I could do it with one hand.
我闭着眼睛也行012---I could do it with my eyes closed.
有一次我只看了一眼012---Once I just looked at one...
它自己就开了012---...and it popped open.
都怪你的胸罩012---I blame your bra!
这是个标准型的胸罩搭扣012---It's a standard issue bra clasp!
那就怪你012---Then I blame you.
对012---Yeah. That's right.
是你把我的天赋都打走了012---You threw me off with all your slapping.
好吧  真的很抱歉  乔伊012---Okay, look, I'm really sorry about that, Joey.
有没有可能是某些层面上012---But do you think maybe, on some level,
你不想脱掉我的胸罩012---you don't want to take off my bra?

他也吓坏了012---He freaked out too.
他甚至解不开我的胸罩012---He couldn't even undo my bra.
真的  有一次他只看了我胸罩一眼012---Really? One time he just looked at my bra
它就自己开了012---and it popped open.
我不知道我们怎么了012---I do not know what's wrong with us.
我们以前接过吻  感觉很好啊012---We've kissed before and that's been great.
可是这次  感觉不同012---But this time it was leading somewhere...
我明白那是乔伊在抚摸我012---...and I was very aware of the fact that it was Joey touching me.
你们要永远做朋友了012---You guys have been friends forever.
记得你第一次吻罗斯吗012---The first time you kissed Ross,
那次多奇怪012---how weird that was.
