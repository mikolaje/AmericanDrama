《老友记》前情介绍：012---Previously on Friends:
艾瑞卡，你还好吧？012---Erica, are you okay?
还好，或许我吃太多了012---Yeah, you know, maybe I ate too much.
一直有点胄痛，几分钟就痛一次012---I keep getting these stomachaches. They come and go, like, every few minutes.
-天啊  -别担心，给她点胃药就好了012----Oh, my God. -Relax, we'll just get her some antacids.
她不是胃痛，是要生了012---She doesn't have a stomachache! She's in labor!
天啊012---Oh, my God!
你认为我没跟你单独道别012---If you think that I didn't say goodbye...
是因为你没有其他人重要  你就错了012---...because you don't mean as much to me as everybody else, you're wrong.
是因为你太重要了012---It's because you mean more to me.
-瑞秋  -干嘛？012----Rach! -What?
嗨012---Hey.
接着睡吧  我该回家了012---Go back to sleep. I have to go home.
真是太棒了012---Oh, God. This was amazing.
的确是012---It really was.
你学了不少新招儿嘛012---You've learned some new moves.
同事给我本《笨人性指南》012---Yeah, well, this guy at work gave me "Sex for Dummies"
想取笑我来着012---as a joke.
-现在看谁笑到最后了  -没错呵012---- Who's laughing now? - I am.
《老友记》  第十季  第17，18集  说再见012---Friends S10E17E18 The Last One
呼气...012---Breathe...
这样就对了012---Okay. Good.
下次我说"呼气"行吗012---Next time, can I say "breathe"?
不行  刚才你说得像吸血鬼一样012---No. Last time, you said it like Dracula,
吓死她了012---and it scared her.
还要点东西吗  冰片012---Can I get you anything? You want some more ice chips?
没事  不用了012---No, I'm okay.
我马上就回来012---All right. I'll be right back.
-去哪里  -洗手间啊012---- Where you going? - To use the bathroom.
-别把我们俩丢在一起啊 -说什么012---- You can't leave me alone with her. - What?
这就是那种社交场合012---This is exactly the kind of social situation...
我最怕的那种012---...that I am not comfortable with.
什么样的场合你不怕啊012---What kind of social situation are you comfortable with?
我和她从来没单独待在一起过012---It's just that we've never spent any time, you know, alone together.
没事的012---You'll be fine.
你不会  不过我马上就回来了012---You won't, but I'll be back in two minutes.
好的012---Okay.
那个...夏天有什么打算012---So any plans for the summer?
不清楚  可能参加个教会野营吧012---I don't know. Maybe church camp.
那你去的时候  最好不要提起生孩子这件事012---May not want to mention this.
有没想过哪种情况更疼012---So you ever wonder which is worse?
产前阵痛和老二被踢012---You know, going through labor or getting kicked in the nuts?
-说什么   -就是想想挺有意思的012---- What? - Oh, it's just interesting.
谁也不会知道的012---Because no one will ever know
因为没人两种情况都能经历吧012---because no one can experience both.
世界上又一无法解答的难题012---One of life's great unanswerable questions.
谁知道  也许还有012---Who knows? Maybe there's something
比那两种情况更糟糕的呢012---even more painful than those things.
比如现在012---Like this.
-进  -早啊012---- Come in. - Morning.
-嗨   -这是什么啊012---- Hey. - What's that?
送莫妮卡和钱德勒的乔迁礼012---Oh, it's my housewarming present for Monica and Chandler.
刚出生的小鸡和小鸭012---That's a baby chick and duck.
我给它俩取名叫小小鸡和小小鸭012---And I named them Chick Jr. And Duck Jr.
真的是没想到哈012---I did not see that coming.
那么大个后院012---They'll love it at that new house.
它俩肯定会喜欢的012---It has that big backyard.
以后要是老了的话012---When they're old,
钱德勒可以和上次一样把它们送到012---they'll go to that farm...
上次那个特别农场去012---...that Chandler took the other chick and duck to.
-没错  -是啊012---- Yes. - Yeah.
不过不能去看望实在是太不爽了012---It's a shame people can't visit there.
没办法  规矩就是这样012---That is the rule though.
好消息  你马上就当舅舅了012---Guess what. You're almost an uncle.
什么012---What?
艾瑞卡昨晚要生了012---Erica went into labor last night.
莫妮卡和钱德勒现在正在医院呢012---Monica and Chandler are at the hospital right now.
-天呐   -我敢肯定是个女孩012---- Oh, my God! - I have a feeling it's gonna be a girl.
你原来还猜本是个女孩来着呢012---Phoebe, you were sure Ben was gonna be a girl.
你看他扔过球吗012---Have you seen him throw a ball?
-瑞秋在不在  -还在睡觉吧012---- Is Rachel here? - I think she's still asleep.
昨晚你俩怎么样了012---How did it go with you guys last night?
她好像怒了012---She seemed pretty pissed at you.
后来事情解决了012---We worked things out.
笑啥呢012---What's that smile?
你俩是不是有事儿012---Did something happen with you two?
我这人办完事以后不喜欢到处宣传012---Hey, I'm not one to kiss and tell.
不过我也不会藏着不说012---But I'm also not one to have sex and shut up.
我俩做爱了012---We totally did it.
天呐  你和瑞秋012---Oh, my God. You and Rachel?
是啊  感觉太棒了012---I know, it's pretty great.
意味着什么啊012---So, what does that mean?
你们复合了012---Are you guys getting back together?
说不好012---Oh, I don't know.
我俩还没仔细谈过012---We didn't really get to talk.
但你自己想复合吗012---But do you want to get back together?
不清楚啊012---I don't know.
真的是难以置信012---It was incredible.
感觉太对了012---I mean, it just felt so right.
我把她抱在怀里时012---When I was holding her,
永远都不想让她离开012---I mean, I never wanted to let her go.
没错  我想和她在一起012---Know what? Yeah, I do. I want to be together.
那她还去巴黎吗012---So is she still going to Paris?
还没想过  希望不会吧012---Wow, I hadn't thought of that. I hope not.
今天太伟大了  太伟大了012---This is, like, the best day ever. Ever.
你俩要复合012---You guys might get back together.
莫妮卡和钱德勒要有小孩012---Monica and Chandler get their baby.
而且世界上012---There are chicks and ducks...
又有小鸡小鸭了012---...in the world again.
感觉就像在音乐剧中一样012---I feel like I'm in a musical.
早啊012---Morning.
你们永远也不知道结尾是什么了012---Guess you'll never know how it ends.
-嘿  -嗨012---- Hey. - Hi.
-睡得怎样  -很好很好  你呢012---- Hi. How'd you sleep? - Good. You?
-不错  -那还用说012---- Good. - I'll bet you did.
能让我俩单独待会儿吗012---Would you guys mind giving us a minute?
好  帮忙看着点小鸡和小鸭012---Sure. Just keep an eye on the chick and duck.
小鸡和小鸭  不是已经死...012---Chick and the duck? Didn't they die--?
死活非要去农场哦012---Dive. Yeah, they dove. Headfirst into fun on the farm.
所以...012---So....
-早啊  -你也是啊012---- Morning. - You too.
昨晚太棒了012---Last night was just wonderful.
真的是012---Oh, it really was.
我今天醒来满脸都是笑容012---I woke up today with a big smile in my face.
我也是啊012---I know, me too. It was....
就像...012---You know, it was one of those things
有些事情觉得从来不可能012---you think is never going to happen.
但有一天真的发生了012---And then it does,
而且是自己所希望的那样012---and it's everything you want it to be.
我知道  实在是...012---I know. It was just....
实在是最好的告别方式了012---It's just the perfect way to say goodbye.
再使点劲  亲爱的012---Just a little bit more, honey.
疼死我了012---Oh, man, this hurts!
真疼得那么厉害012---Is it really that bad?
现在该踢你老二012---I think it's time to kick you in the nuts
看看哪个更疼012---and see which is worse.
婴儿的头已经要出来了012---The baby's head is crowning.
天呐012---Oh, my God!
我所见过的最美丽的头顶了012---That is the most beautiful top of a head I have ever seen.
-钱德勒 过来看   -我就不用了012---- Chandler, you have to see this. - I'm okay.
钱德勒  绝不能错过的012---Chandler. You don't want to miss this.
你孩子出生了012---This is the birth of your child.
-生命的奇迹啊   -好吧012---- It's the miracle of life. - All right.
哇  这么恶心的奇迹012---Wow, that is one disgusting miracle.
使劲  出来了012---Start pushing. Here we go.
好  肩膀出来了012---Here come the shoulders.
是个男孩012---It's a boy.
-他没事儿吧  -他没事儿012---- Is he okay? - He's just fine.
你成功了012---You did it.
是个婴儿012---It's a baby.
美丽的小婴儿012---A beautiful little baby.
还有点其他东西我就装没看见吧012---And some other stuff I'm gonna pretend I don't see.
-你要剪脐带吗   -好012---- Would you like to cut the umbilical cord? - Okay.
真有弹性012---Well, that's spongy.
嘿  帅哥012---Hey, handsome.
我会很爱你012---I'll love you so much that
让你感觉任何女人都不如我爱你012---no woman is ever gonna be good enough for you.
-咱们太幸运了  -是啊012---- We are so lucky. - I know.
他眼睛和你的一样012---He has your eyes.
虽然不可能吧012---I mean, I know that's not possible,
不过真的是012---but he does.
我们来把他擦干净吧012---We'll just get him cleaned up a bit.
真是太美了012---Oh, my God, he's beautiful.
多谢你啊012---Thank you so much.
太为你们俩高兴了012---I'm really happy for you guys.
-现在感觉如何  -累啊012---- How do you feel? - I'm tired.
没多少时间可歇了012---You don't have that much time to relax.
下一个马上就出来012---The other one will be along in a minute.
抱歉  你刚说多久谁要出来012---I'm sorry, who should be along in a what, now?
下一个孩子马上就出来012---The next baby should be along in a minute.
我们只订了一个012---We only ordered one.
-你们知道是双胞胎吧   -才怪012---- You know it's twins, right? - Oh, yeah.
知道我们俩还能这副表情012---These are the faces of two people in the know.
怎么可能不知道是双胞胎012---I can't believe you didn't know it's twins.
以前从来没有过的012---This has never happened before.
这让我感觉又特殊又好啊012---Well, gosh. That makes me feel so special and good.
等等  你知道是双胞胎012---Wait. Did you know it was twins?
是啊  俄亥俄州送过来的文件里面写着呢012---It's here in the paperwork we got from the clinic in Ohio.
-有人告诉过你吗   -没有啊012---- Did anybody tell you? - I don't think so.
不过确实提到了两种心跳012---They did mention two heartbeats,
我当时觉得应该就是我和孩子的吧012---but l thought it was just mine and the baby's.
他们就一直说两个心跳都很强012---They said, "Both heartbeats are strong."
我就觉得不错啊 因为我正怀着孩子呢012---And I thought, "Well, that's good, because I'm having a baby."
太难以置信了012---This is unbelievable.
我家有生双胞胎的传统012---Twins actually run in my family.
真有意思哈012---Interesting.
跟你谈点事012---Can I see you for a second?
现在咋办012---What do we do?
什么咋办012---What do you mean, "What do we do?"
双胞胎012---Twins!
双胞胎012---Twins!
钱德勒  你慌什么012---Chandler, you're panicking.
没错  和我一起慌吧012---Join me, won't you?
我们留一个012---What do you say we keep one
另一个给别人如何012---and then just have an option on the other one?
-怎么可以分开啊  -为什么不行啊012---- We can't split them up. - Why not?
给他俩一人半块信物012---We could give each of them half a medallion.
数年之后他们凭着信物重逢012---And then years later, they'll find each other...
大团圆012---...and be reunited.
到那时候大家该多开心啊012---I mean, that's a great day for everybody.
如果领养另一个人的是坏蛋呢012---What if the person who adopts the other one is horrible?
要不是呢012---What if they're not?
要是被某国王领养了呢012---What if it's adopted by a king?
是哈  听说国王要领养个孩子012---Yeah. Because I hear the king is looking to adopt.
莫妮卡  咱俩没想好要两个孩子的012---Monica, we are not ready to have two babies.
又有什么关系012---That doesn't matter.
咱们等了这么久012---We have waited so long for this.
我才不管是一个孩子还是两个孩子012---I don't care if it's two babies.
仨孩子都没关系012---I don't care if it's three babies.
生出《八宝喜事》全剧组来都没关系012---I don't care if the entire cast of "Eight Is Enough" comes out of there.
一定要把他们带回家012---We are taking them home
因为他们是咱们的孩子啊012---because they are our children.
好吧012---Okay.
-好  -好012---- Okay. - Okay!
好了012---Okay.
看来我们这里准备好了012---It looks like we're about ready over here.
来吧  艾瑞卡012---Come on, Erica.
开始用力012---Start pushing again now.
-女婴也出来了  -女婴  是个女孩012---- Here she comes. - She? It's a girl?
对012---Yeah.
现在一男一女了012---Well, now we have one of each.
然后就别再生了012---And that's enough.
后来她说那是最好的告别方式012---And then she said it was the perfect way to say goodbye.
天呐  你说什么了012---Oh, my God. What did you say?
什么都没说  能说什么啊012---Nothing. What do you say to that?
罗斯  一定要告诉她你的感受啊012---You've got to tell her how you feel.
-不行  -不能就这么放弃她啊012---- No way. - Well, you can't just give up.
恐龙会这么做吗012---Is that what a dinosaur would do?
啥012---What?
我就是想用你们的语言和你表达012---Dude. I'm just trying to speak your language.
罗斯  瑞秋不知道你想复合012---Ross, Rachel doesn't know that you even wanna get back together.
如果她知道 想法可能就会变啊012---If she did, she might feel differently.
也许就不会走了012---She might not even go.
-你真的这么想   -没错的012---- You really think so? - I'm telling you!
好的  如果是音乐剧的话012---Oh, ok, this is the part of the musical
现在就应该是高潮了012---where there'd be a good, convincing song.
嗨012---Hi.
死活就不让我唱完了是吧012---Can't a girl finish a song around here?
-嘿  -刚把艾玛交给我妈了012---- Hey. - Hi. I dropped Emma off at my mom's.
-哦  -你今晚不带艾玛走012---- Okay. - You're not taking her tonight?
不带了  我先去整理好 我妈星期天把艾玛带去012---No. We decided I'd set up, then my mom would bring Emma to Paris on Sunday.
陪一岁小孩飞八个小时012---Eight-hour flight with a one year old.
祝你妈妈好运012---Good luck, Mom.
开什么玩笑012---You kidding?
陪我妈飞八个小时听她唠叨减肥食谱012---Eight hours with my mom talking about Atkins.
还是祝艾玛好运吧012---Good luck, Emma.
你说得对012---All right. You know what? You're right.
至少要告诉她我的感受012---I should at least tell her how I feel.
-罗斯等一下  -什么  什么012---- Ross. Wait, wait. - What? What?
给我带个松饼吧012---Could you get me a muffin?
-瑞秋  -嗯012---- Rachel? - Yeah?
我知道你今晚就走了012---I know you're leaving tonight,
我就是想告诉你012---but I just have to tell you.
我爱你012---I love you.
不知道你的计划会不会因此改变012---Now, I don't know if that changes your plans at all.
不过我觉得还是应该告诉你012---But I thought you should know.
甘瑟012---Gunther.
我也爱你012---I love you too.
不过和你爱我含义应该不一样012---Probably not in the same way.
但我真的爱你012---But I do.
每次我在咖啡屋喝咖啡012---And when I'm in a cafe having coffee...
或者看见谁的头发比太阳还亮012---...or I see a man with hair brighter than the sun...
我都会想起你012---...I'll think of you.
-回头见  -拜012---- Bye, you guys. - Bye.
我的天啊012---Oh, my God!
难以置信啊012---Unbelievable.
我有个好主意012---Hey, you know what might help?
我不会给你拿松饼的012---I'm not getting you a muffin!
你觉得他俩从肚子里出来012---Do you think they recognize each other
认得出对方吗012---from in there?
也许  除非像俩多年的邻居012---Maybe. Unless they're like people who've lived in apartments...
突然有一天被挤出产道012---...next to each other for years, then one day they're pushed through a vagina...
终于见面了012---...and they meet.
我们现在带艾瑞卡去休息了012---We're going to take Erica to Recovery now.
有点事情我们要和你说012---There's something that we wanted to tell you.
我们决定给女孩起名为艾瑞卡012---We decided to name the girl baby Erica.
天呐  这不和我名字一样吗012---Oh, my God, that's just like my name!
他奶奶的  还真是012---Son of a gun, it is.
总之我要先去休息了012---Anyway, I'm gonna go get some rest.

-没说  也不打算说了  -什么012---- No. And I'm not going to. - What?
为什么啊012---Why not?
因为她会拒绝我的012---She's just gonna shoot me down.
你俩也看见甘瑟了012---You guys saw what happened with Gunther.
最后成那样有意思吗012---That did not look like fun.
你怎么能把自己同甘瑟比012---How can you compare yourself to Gunther?
的确他从表面上来说012---I mean, sure, he's sexy
比你更性感012---in a more obvious way.
你和瑞秋真正做过恋人啊012---You have a relationship with her.

女孩名叫艾瑞卡012---Her name is Erica.
那个怀孕的女孩不也叫艾瑞卡吗012---Hey, that pregnant girl's name was Erica.
没错  你们俩没多相处相处太可惜了012---Yeah. It's a shame you two didn't get to spend more time together.
我们给男孩起名叫杰克012---Yeah, and we named the boy Jack,
随老爸的012---after Dad.
他一定会高兴极了的012---He's gonna be so happy.
杰克·宾  这名字我喜欢012---Jack Bing. I love that.
听起来像是四十年代写新闻的啊012---It sounds like a '40s newspaper guy.
"杰克·宾  来自《早报》012---You know, "Jack Bing, Morning Gazette.
我一定要把这丑闻曝光"012---I'm gonna blow this story wide open."
我的天012---Oh, my gosh.
太美了012---So beautiful.
我也想要一个012---I want one.
哦  告诉我哪个012---Oh, yeah? Well, tell me which one.
一会儿夹在大衣里顺走012---I'll try to slip it in my coat.
说真的012---Seriously.
不想生一个012---I mean, you want to make one of those?
一个  一堆怎么样012---One? How about a whole bunch?
真的012---Really?
是啊  啊  可以教他们唱歌012---Yeah. We can teach them to sing,
就像《音乐之声》那一家子一样012---and we could be like the von Trapp family.
不过不要纳粹012---Only without the Nazis.
但是这样就没意思了012---Although that sounds kind of dull.
真不敢相信012---I can't believe this.
不过我要是012---If I don't leave now,
再不走就赶不上飞机了012---I'm gonna miss my plane.
你能见孩子们一面我真是太高兴了012---I'm so glad you got to see the babies.
我也是012---Me too.
真遗憾不能留下来012---I'm just sorry I'm not gonna be around
看你照顾孩子手忙脚乱了012---to watch you two attempt to handle this.
真的说不出告别的话012---All right. Oh, I can't say goodbye to you guys again.
-我太爱你们了  -我们也爱你012---- I love you all so much. - Love you.
-爱你  -到了打电话啊012---- We love you. - Call us when you get there.
一定  罗斯  过来012---I will. Ross, come here.
我想告诉你012---I just want you to know...
昨晚012---...last night...
我永远都不会忘记的012---...I'll never forget it.
我也不会012---Neither will l.
好吧  现在真的要走了012---All right. Now I really have to go.
再见012---Okay, au revoir.
到那他们一定会恨死我的012---They're gonna really hate me over there.
你就这么让她走了012---So you just let her go?
嗯012---Yeah.
-这样也许是最好的了 -是吗012---- Hey, maybe that's for the best. - Yeah?
是的  关于昨晚012---Yeah. You know, you just-- Look, you gotta--
她怎么想你也应该怎么想012---You gotta think about last night the way she does.
也许...也许上床012---Okay? You know, maybe....
就是最好的告别了012---Maybe sleeping together was the perfect way to say goodbye.
可是这样一来她就不知道他的感受了啊012---Now she'll never know how he feels.
也许没关系的012---Maybe that's okay, you know?
也许这样更好012---Maybe it is better this way.
现在...现在你可以向前继续生活了012---I mean, now.... Now you can move on.
你已经努力适应这么久了012---I mean, you've been trying to for so long.
现在你们俩身在不同的大陆...012---Maybe now that you're on different continents....
是吧012---Right?
也许你现在终于可以解脱了012---Maybe now you can actually do it, you know.
终于可以不再想她了012---You can finally get over her.
的确是这样没错012---Yeah, that's true.
可是...012---Except....
我不愿意就这样解脱012---I don't want to get over her.
什么012---What?
我不想  我想和她在一起012---I don't. I want to be with her.
真的012---Really?
嗯  我去追她012---Yeah. I'm going to go after her.
去吧012---Yeah, you are!

虽然一点都不明白咋回事012---I have no idea what's going on,
不过我现在太兴奋了012---but I am excited!
罗斯  你觉得她会怎么说012---What do you think she's gonna say?
不知道012---I don't know.
不过即便她拒绝我012---Even if she shoots me down,
我也不会余生都活在猜测之中012---at least I won't spend my life wondering...
我外套哪儿去了012---...what would have happened. Where is my coat?
你根本就没穿来012---You didn't bring one!
我车就在下面012---My cab's downstairs.
开车送你去机场012---I'll drive you to the airport.
-大伙祝我好运   -快012---- Wish me luck. - Hurry!
祝你好运012---Good luck!
没安全带012---There's no seat belts!
没关系  一旦车撞到什么东西012---That's okay. If we hit anything...
马达就会爆炸012---...the engine will explode,
相比之下还是被甩出去比较好012---so it's better if you're thrown from the car.
-好  我们走   -好012---- All right, all right. Let's do this. - Okay!
-喂  -东区80号012---- Hey! - 80th and East End.
我不载客012---No. I don't take passengers.
法律规定逢客必载的012---The law makes you accept any fare.
你不明白  这车本来就不是计程车012---You don't understand. This cab isn't real.
等我去投诉你  你牌照号多少012---What's your medallion number?
号码是  滚出车去012---My medallion number is, get out of the cab!

自行车上的老太太还活着吗012---Is the old woman on the bicycle still alive?
活着  她及时跳开了012---Yeah, she jumped right back up.
天呐  菲比  开慢点012---Oh, my God. Phoebe, slow down!
你到底想不想及时追上瑞秋012---Do you want to get to Rachel in time?
想  不过我不想死在你车里012---Yes, but I don't want to die in your cab.
上车之前你怎么不想清楚012---You should have thought of that before you got in!
-收费站  -什么012---- Tollbooth. - What?
收费站012---Tollbooth!
四块钱  杂物箱里有零钱012---Four bucks. There are quarters in the glove compartment.
快点012---Hurry!
哦012---Okay.
妈的  窗户怎么这么干净012---Damn, that window's clean.
我们还说你拿礼物这么半天还不回来012---We were wondering what was taking so long...
现在才知道你在干这个012---...but now we understand. You were doing this.
我本想给你们个惊喜的012---Okay. I wanted to surprise you, but....
作为乔迁礼012---For your housewarming gift,
送给你们一只小鸡一只小鸭012---I got you a baby chick and a baby duck.
真的  给我们小鸡小鸭012---Really? You got us a chick and a duck?
太好了012---Oh, great.
家里有婴儿012---Just what you want for
鸟粪真是锦上添花啊012---a new house with infants. Bird feces!
一定是从桌子上跳下去了012---But they must've jumped off the table.
现在都不见了啊012---Now they're gone!
别着急  慢慢找012---Don't worry, we'll find them.
我去看孩子去了012---Actually, I'm gonna go check on the twins.
天呐  我刚才踩着什么了012---Oh, God! What did I just step on?
没事了  就是个蛋卷012---It's okay. It's just an egg roll.
你竟敢踩我的蛋卷012---You stepped on my egg roll?!
抱歉012---I'm sorry.
谁会想到地上会有中国菜012---I didn't know to look for Chinese food on the floor.
放到盘子里  然后快走012---Just put it on a plate and leave.
-好了  开始找吧  -好012---- Okay. Let's find these birds. - All right.
等等  听到了没012---Wait, wait. You hear that?
在桌子里012---They're in the table!
这可不妙了012---Well, that can't be good.
-必须要取出来  -怎么取012---- We gotta get them out of there! - How?
也许能引诱他们出来  你知道鸟怎么叫吗012---Maybe we can lure them out. You know any birdcalls?
当然了  我就是干伐木工的012---Oh, tons. I'm quite the woodsman.
把桌子一头抬起来点也许管用012---Well, maybe we can just tip the table a little.
乔伊等一下  球012---Joey, wait! The ball!
现在怎么办012---So, what do we do?
不清楚  也许边上什么地方能打开吧012---Maybe we can open this up somehow.
好012---Okay.
不行啊  都粘上了012---No. It's all glued together.
也就是说要生撬开012---Does that mean we have to bust it open?
-不知道也许吧  -天呐012---- I don't know. Maybe. - Oh, my God.
我明白  这可是足球桌啊012---I know. It's-- It's the foosball table.
没有办法了012---All right, you know what? We don't have a choice.
就像我在一部科幻电影里面的台词一样012---It's like I would have said in that sci-fi movie
如果我当初赢到角色的话012---if I'd have gotten the part.
"里面是我们的人  必须要救出来"012---Those are our men in there, and we have to get them out...
"即使要牺牲我生命中最重要的东西...012---...even if I have to sacrifice the most important thing in my life...
我的时间机器"012---...my time machine.
-这电影拍出来了没   -根本也没拍012---- Did that movie ever get made? - It did not.
罗斯  你去哪里012---Ross, where are you going?
去找瑞秋啊012---To talk to Rachel.
所以我才坐死亡计程车来的012---Isn't that why we took a ride in the death cab?
你就直接去登机口012---You're walking up to her at the gate?
以前在没在机场追过人012---Have you never chased anyone through the airport before?
我的警察戏镜头被取消之后就没有过了012---Not since my cop show got canceled.
必须先买票才能通过安检012---You have to get a ticket to get past security.
那就赶不及了啊012---What? We're never gonna make it.
这种态度肯定不行  快滚过来012---Not with that attitude. Now, haul ass!
大家再走慢点012---Okay, if you could all walk slower,
就好了012---that'd be great.
-女士  看一下您的护照   -天呐012---- Madame, your passport, please. - Oh, my God.
我还害怕高中学的法语都忘干净了呢012---I was afraid I wouldn't remember my high school French.
你刚才说的每个字我都听明白了012---But I understood every word you just said.
-看一下您的登机牌  -哦  当然012---- Your boarding pass, please. - Oh, sure.
讨厌  我有的  真不敢相信012---Shoot, I had it. Oh, I can't believe this.

我有我有我有我有012---I have it, I have it!
哎呀  找不到012---Okay, I can't find it,
不过我清楚记得 我的座位号是32C012---but I remember that I was in seat 32C...
因为我罩杯号就是这个012---...because that's my bra size.
女士  您必须要有登机牌  否则……012---Madame. You must have your boarding pass--
好吧012---Ok, fine. But you know what?
我要是36D  就没这么多麻烦了012---If I was in 36D, we would not be having this problem.
-您好  我要买一张票  -就买一张012---- Hi. I need a ticket. - Just one?
我开车这么大老远送你过来012---I drive you here,
不能看看结局啥样012---and I don't get to see how it works out?

找不到  你呢012---I don't see it. Do you see it?
我也找不着  错过了012---No. Did we miss it?
不可能  20分钟后才起飞的012---No, no, it's impossible. It doesn't leave for another 20 minutes.
航班号错了吧012---Maybe we have the flight number wrong.

我理解012---I understand.
好012---Okay.
桌子012---Table...
你曾经给予我们太多的欢乐时光012---...you have given us so many great times.

是啊  太难了012---Oh, well, sure. It's got to be so hard.
我来吧  给我012---I'll do it. Give me.
菲比012---Phoebe!

以前从没开这么快过012---Wow, I've never gone this fast before.
菲比  算了吧012---Phoebe, forget it, okay?
纽瓦克  一个小时才能到012---Newark is, like, an hour away.
根本赶不上012---There's no way we'll make it in time.
她拿着手机呢  打电话012---She's got her cell. You could call her.
我不要在电话上谈012---I am not doing this over the phone.
你没其他办法了啊012---You don't have any other choice.
-喂  -瑞秋  太好了012---- Hello? - Rachel. Oh, good.
对了  你是不是刚上飞机012---By the way, did you just get on the plane?
-是啊 -不管怎样提一句   如果机场没去错012---- Yeah. - For what is worse, we would have caught her...
我们已经追上她了012---...if we were at the right airport.
-瑞  等着  -不不不012---- Rachel, hang on. - <i>No. No. No.
菲比  你那边不要紧吧012---Phoebe, is everything okay?
事实上  有点事情  你必须下飞机012---Actually, no. No. You have to get off the plane.
-啊  为什么  -我有种感觉012---- What? Why? - I have this feeling that...
飞机有问题012---...something's wrong with it.
左"弗兰基"有毛病012---Something is wrong with the left phalange.
亲爱的  飞机肯定没问题的012---Oh, honey, I'm sure there's nothing wrong with the plane.
马上要起飞了012---Look, I have to go.
我爱你  一到巴黎就打电话012---I love you, and l will call you the minute I get to Paris.
你刚才说什么012---What was that?
哦  我的疯朋友012---Oh, that was just my crazy friend.
让我下飞机012---She told me to get off the plane
因为她就是感觉到012---because she had a "feeling" that there...
飞机左"弗兰基"有毛病012---...was something wrong with the left phalange.
听起来可不妙吧012---Okay. That doesn't sound good.
不用担心012---Oh, I wouldn't worry about it.
她老是这样012---She comes up with this stuff,
而且几乎从没对过012---and she's almost never right.
也就是说她也有对的时候012---But she is sometimes.
啊012---Well....
你要干吗012---What are you doing?
这飞机我不能坐012---I can't take this plane now.
对不起先生  您去哪里012---Excuse me, sir. Where are you going?
我要下飞机012---I have to get off this plane.
她朋友感觉到012---Her friend has a feeling
飞机左"弗兰基"有毛病012---something's wrong with the left phalange.
请给我拿点花生好吗012---Could I get some peanuts?
飞机怎么了012---What's wrong with the plane?
飞机一点异常都没有012---There's nothing wrong.
左"弗兰基"有毛病了012---The left phalange.
根本就没有什么"弗兰基"012---There's no "phalange."
天呐  这破飞机连"弗兰基"都没有012---Oh, my God. This plane doesn't even have a phalange.
-我不飞了 -女士  请您坐好012---- I'm not flying on it. - Ma'am. Please sit down.
出什么事情了012---What's going on?
我们都下去  飞机上根本就没有"弗兰基"012---We're getting off. There is no phalange!
太荒谬了吧  我...012---This is ridiculous. I--
啊随便吧012---Yeah, okay.
好了  工作完成012---All right. My job here is done.
你太强了012---That was impressive.
大部分连工具都没用就弄下来了012---Yeah. You didn't even use the tools for most of it.
啊  工具太碍事了012---Yeah, they were just slowing me down.
好啦  我回去看孩子了012---All right. I gotta get back to the babies.
你们俩个丫头一会儿见012---See you girls later.
-真抱歉阿  桌子这样了  -嗯012---- Sorry about the table, man. - Yeah.
要买新的吗012---You gonna buy a new one?
也许不会了012---Probably not. No.
你走后我估计012---I don't know how much I'm gonna want to play
也不会怎么玩了012---after you go.
-至少这两个小家伙救出来了 -是啊012---- At least we got these little guys out. - Yeah.
我们还担心你们呢012---We were worried about you.
以后就多习惯有东西012---I guess I better get used to things
在我手里拉屎吧012---crapping in my hand, huh?
我会想你们的  小家伙012---I'm gonna miss these little guys.
再养养鸟还真挺不错的012---It was nice having birds around again.
这样吧012---Hey, you know what?
它们就交给你了012---Maybe we should keep them here with you.
什么012---What?
嗯  我们现在也忙得要死012---Yeah. We got a lot going on right now.
而且这里也有它们的房间啊012---And plus, here, they'd have their own room.
还可以再养只鹅012---I could get a goose!
我觉得家禽类这两只就够了012---You know, I think you're set with the poultry.
多谢了  听到没有012---Thanks, man. You hear that, you guys?
你们要留在这里啦012---You're gonna get to stay here.
而且这样也挺好的012---And it's good...
因为012---...you know, because....
你就有理由012---Because now you have a reason
多回来看看了012---to come visit.
其实还有另外一个理由012---I think there may be another reason.
那么...012---So....
尴尬的拥抱呢  还是假酷男握手呢012---Awkward hug or lame cool-guy handshake?
啊  那好012---Yeah, well, you know,
还是假酷男握手吧012---lame cool-guy handshake.
女士  我想您保证  飞机没有问题012---Ma'am, I assure you, the plane is fine.
"弗兰基"也修好啦012---And you fixed the phalange?
没错  修好了012---Yes. The phalange's fixed.
而且012---As a matter of fact,
还又带了许多备用的012---we've put a whole lot of extra phalanges onboard,
