好吧  罗斯012---Okay, Ross.
我知道你不想进来看到这个012---I realize that you didn't expect to walk in and see that, but...
听我解释好吗012---Let me explain, okay?
我们什么都没做012---We weren't doing anything!
瑞秋  他看到了012---Rach, he just saw us.
但你所看到的012---But what you saw,
就是全部了012---that is the extent of it, okay?
仅仅一个吻而已012---One kiss.
不  你说谎我们在巴巴多斯就吻过了012---No, come on. That's a lie! We also kissed in Barbados.
哥们儿  闭嘴012---Dude, chill!
好吧  我们在巴巴多斯也吻过012---Okay, we also kissed in Barbados...
可我们没想那样012---...but we didn't plan it. Ok?
发生这件事的唯一原因012---The only reason that that happened...
是我看见你吻查莉了012---...was because I saw you kiss Charlie.
对  是你开始的  我真的该闭嘴012---Yeah, you started it!  I have got to chill.
好吧  我们或许应该012---Look, we probably should
在事情发生之前跟你说012---have talked to you about this before it ever happened.
可是...012---But....
我们也感到非常抱歉  罗斯012---Oh, we feel so terrible about this, Ross.
是  可它确实发生了012---Yeah. But it did happen.
所以...012---So...
罗斯012---Ross?
罗斯012---Ross?
干脆把门关了算了012---Can we just close the door?
《老友记》  第十季  第2集 罗斯不难过012---Friends S10E02 The One Where Ross Is Fine
罗斯  说点什么012---Ross, say something.
什么都行012---Anything.
所以说你们俩...012---So you two are...?
-是  -是012---- Yeah. - Yeah.
那你们有没有...012---And have you had...?
-没...  -没...012---- No... - No...
可如果我没进来的话  你们会不会...012---But if I hadn't walked in here, would you...?
也许...不  不会012---Probably--No. No.
罗斯  我们本来没想012---Ross, this is not how we wanted you
让你以这种方式发现012---to find out about this.
你有权利抓狂012---You have every right to go nuts.
我不会抓狂的012---I'm not going nuts.
你看我抓狂了012---Do you see me going nuts?
不  可你知道我的意思012---No, but you know what I mean.
如果你们俩开心...012---If you two are happy...
那我也会为你们开心012---...then I'm happy for you.
我没事012---I'm fine.
-真的  -当然012---- Really? - Absolutely.
我没事012---I'm fine.
完全没事012---Totally fine.
我不知道为什么012---I don't know why it's coming out
我的声音又大又尖012---all loud and squeaky...
不过说真的  我没事012---...because, really, I'm fine.
我不是说看见你们接吻012---I'm not saying I wasn't a little surprised
一点也不吃惊012---to see you guys kissing.
我是说  开始我有点...012---I mean, at first I was like:
不过现在  给我时间消化了012---But now that I've had time to absorb it...
喜欢了012---Loving this.
-罗斯  -都解决了012---- Ross. - It's all working out.
我和查莉  还有你们俩012---Me and Charlie. And you two.
知道我们应该干什么吗012---You know what we should do?
冷静下来012---Calm ourselves?
不012---No.
我们应该一起吃顿饭012---We should all have dinner.
对  我们明天晚上就吃  我来掌勺012---Yes, we'll do it tomorrow night. I'll cook!
你不觉得那样太怪了吗012---Look, don't you think that would be a little weird?
怪  为什么  哪儿怪了012---Weird? What? What's weird?
如果有人不喜欢墨西哥菜才是怪事012---The only thing weird would be if someone didn't like Mexican food...
因为我会做法加它（一种墨西哥食物）012---...because I'm making fajitas!
我非常喜欢法加它012---I do like fajitas.
天呐  领养怎么这么多事儿啊012---God, this adoption stuff is so overwhelming.
有跨国领养  从属领养...012---There's inter-country adoption, dependency adoption.
有这么多方法012---There's so many ways to go,
这就像我们一生中最大的决定012---and this is, like, the biggest decision of our lives.
我咖啡里有根头发012---There's a hair in my coffee.
嗨  伙计们012---Hey, guys.
看见小弗兰克了吗012---Have you seen Frank Jr.?
他要带着三胞胎来看我012---He's meeting me here with the triplets.
太有意思了  每次你说"三胞胎"012---It's funny, every time you say "triplets" ...
我马上就想到三个火辣的19岁金发女郎012---...l think of three hot, blond 19-year-olds.
真有爱012---That's sweet.
喝你的头发吧012---Drink your hair.
这都是啥012---Hey, what's all this stuff?
这些是我们从不同的领养中心找来的小册子012---They're brochures from different adoption agencies.
小孩子  这个好可爱012---Babies! Oh, this one is so cute.
就要这个012---Get this one.
不是说要哪个就能要的012---That's not really how it works.
-那怎么办的  -我不知道012---- Oh, how does it work?  - I don't know!
如果你们遇到什么困难012---If you're having a hard time,
可以跟我的朋友们谈谈012---you should talk to my friends...
比尔和科琳012---...Bill and Colleen.
他们领养了个孩子012---They adopted a kid.
肯定会帮你们的012---I'm sure they'd help you.
谢谢  这太好了012---Thanks, that would be great.
老公  是不是很棒012---Hey, honey, wouldn't that be great?
别跑...  记住我们刚说的012---All right, all right. Remember what we talked about.
在公共场合  要有一定的规矩012---When we're in a public place, there are certain rules.
我们不是这么说的012---That's not what we talked about!
-嗨  弗兰克  -嗨012---- Hi, Frank. - Hi.
-见到你真好  -我也一样012---- Good to see you. - Good to see you too.
-嗨  弗兰克.  -嗨  过得怎么样012---- Hi, Frank.  - Hi. Hey, how you doing?
天呐  他们都这么大了012---Oh, my goodness, they've all gotten so big.
哪个是哪个啊012---Which one is which again?
那个从那个女士包里012---Well, that's Frank Jr. Jr...
扯出卫生棉来的是小小弗兰克012---...pulling the tampons out of the lady's purse.
钱德勒在往钱德勒身上爬012---And that's Chandler climbing on Chandler.
莱丝莉在往他身上扔百吉饼012---That's Leslie throwing bagels at him.
想领养三胞胎吗  绝不012---"Willing to adopt triplets?"  No.
我要说我们这么做是为了罗斯012---Can I just say, I know we're doing this for Ross
这没啥012---and that's cool.
不过如果让我来定的话012---But if it was up to me,
第一次约会我们不会做这个012---this is not what we'd be doing on our first date.
那么  我们会做什么012---Well, what would we be doing?
我会带你出去过一个浪漫的夜晚012---I'd take you out for a romantic night.
有香槟  法国大餐012---Some champagne, fancy dinner,
在回家的马车上对你动手动脚012---feel you up on the carriage ride home.
动手动脚012---Feel me up?
在马车里012---In a carriage.
-嗨  查莉  -嗨012---- Hey, Charlie! - Hi.
-嗨  -嘿012---- Hi. - Hey.
那么..012---So...
-害怕吗  -必须的012---- ...dreading this?  - Oh, you bet.
所以  你给罗斯带来点东西012---So did you bring a little something for Ross?
实际上  这些是你落在我公寓的012---Actually, it's some stuff you left at my apartment.
噢  谢谢012---Well, thanks.
你什么时候把我的东西还给我都可以012---And you can just give me my stuff whenever you want.
好  我什么都没丢掉012---Yeah, I didn't throw any of that out.
我说我听到什么声音了012---I thought I heard voices.
嗨  查莉012---Hi, Charlie.
嗨  乔伊012---Hey, Joey.
噢  你该向我介绍你的新女朋友012---And, oh, you're gonna have to introduce me to your new girlfriend.
我开玩笑的  我认识瑞秋  我认识012---I'm just kidding. I know Rachel. I know.
进来  请进来  进来012---Come. Please come in. Come in.
好的  我们带来瓶酒012---Okay. Well, we brought you some wine.
想得真周到012---That is so thoughtful.
就是她别换人了012---She's a keeper.
你又带来了什么012---And what did you bring me, huh?
实际上  那是...012---Actually, that's--
内裤  牙刷012---Underwear, a toothbrush
还有范·海伦的唱片012---...and a Van Halen CD.
这些我都用得着012---I can use all these things!
天呐  罗斯  你看起来有点...012---Gosh, Ross, you know, you seem a little--
什么  心情很好是吗  我本来就是012---What? Fine? Because I am.
你呢  你呢  你呢  看到了吗012---Aren't you? Aren't you? Aren't--? You see?
还有谁心情好012---Who else is fine?
高兴起来012---Come on.
听着  罗斯  放松一点012---Listen. Why don't you try to relax.
好吗  来喝点什么012---Maybe have a drink.
知道吗  这是个好主意012---You know what, that is a very good idea.
我要去弄一大罐马格丽塔酒012---I'm gonna go make a pitcher of margaritas.
天啊012---Oh, God.
真可爱012---So adorable.
看他们睡得就像天使一样012---Look at them, sleeping there like angels.
对  我也很珍惜这点时间012---Yeah, I really cherish these moments...
因为没多久012---...because before you know it,
他们就会醒过来012---they're gonna be awake again.
他们可能比较难控制012---Well, they may be a handful...
-可他们真得很可爱  -是啊012---- ...but they're so cute.  - Yeah.
天呐  我最后一次照看他们的时候012---Oh, God, last time I babysat them,
他们最好玩了012---they did the funniest thing.
我已经4年没睡觉了012---I haven't slept in four years.
这么久了012---That's a long time.
你不知道这有多难  菲比012---You just don't know how hard it is, Phoebe.
他们太多了012---There's just so many of them.
两个我还能行012---You know, two I could handle.
两个就太好了  你正一手抱着一个012---Two's great. You just hold one in each hand.
可第三个戴着自行车头盔012---What do I do when the third one runs at me
朝我跑过来的时候怎么办012---with his bike helmet on?
我又没有另一只手来保护我的要害012---I got no more hands to protect my area.
他们是三个  菲比  三个012---There's three of them, Phoebe. Three.
是  我知道  弗兰克012---Yeah, I know, Frank.
他们从我要害出来的时候012---I counted them
我数过了012---when they were coming out of my area.
有时候我甚至想...012---Sometimes, I think that--
不...  我不能说012---Oh, no, no, no, I can't say it.
太可怕了  不012---It's too horrible. No.
什么012---What?
不...  我不能012---No, no, I can't.
天呐  弗兰克012---Oh, my God, Frank.
你想撇下他们不管012---Are you thinking of leaving?
我生那三个孩子012---Because I didn't have those triplets
不是用来让你遗弃的012---so you could run out on them.
不  我永远不会那么做  不012---Oh, no, I would never do that. No. I just...
我只是想012---...was thinking that, you know,
也许你可以带走一个012---maybe you could take one.
什么012---What?
你不能把它们分开012---You can't separate them,
这太可怕了  哪一个012---that's terrible! Which one?
谢谢你能让我们来012---Thank you so much for seeing us.
菲比跟我们说过012---Phoebe has told us
你们人很好012---great things about you guys.
我们很愿意帮忙012---Please, we're happy to help.
我们领养的时候也经历过这种事012---We went through the same thing when we were adopting.
所以你们家012---So a lot of malfunctioning
"小弟弟""小妹妹"们都功能故障啊012---wee-wees and hoo-hoos in this room, huh?
我是说  你们的家很温馨012---I mean, you have a lovely home.
你们传授任何经验  我们都很感激012---We appreciate anything you can tell us.
实际上  我想这个会有帮助012---Well, actually, I think this might help.
这些大概就是...012---It's pretty much...
你们所需要的所有信息了012---...all the information you need.
噢  天呐012---Oh, my God.
所有的东西都按类别分开012---Everything is broken into categories,
可以对照参考012---then cross-referenced.
还根据背面的颜色进行了标注012---Then color-coded to correspond with the forms in the back.
太感谢了012---Thank you.
我想我刚经历了一次小高潮012---I think I just had a tiny orgasm.
我知道过程是让人沮丧的012---I know the process is frustrating,
不过是值得的012---but it's so worth it.
领养欧文012---Adopting Owen was the best thing
是我们经历过得最好的事情012---that ever happened to us.
太棒了  我能看看这本书吗012---That's great. Can I see the book?
你想让我先洗手  是不是012---You want me to wash my hands first, don't you?
这个这么漂亮  而且是白的012---It's just so pretty and white.
洗手间在走廊那头  左边012---Bathroom is down the hall to your left.
是我也会让他这么做012---I would have told him to do it too.
我能领养你吗012---Can I adopt you?
-嗨  你一定是欧文  -对012---- Hey, you must be Owen.  - Yeah.
我叫钱德勒  我也当过童子军012---I'm Chandler. Hey, I was in the Scouts too.
真的012---You were?
当然  实际上我爸爸是童子军的女训导员012---Yeah. In fact, my father was a den mother.
你知道怎么用指南针吗012---You know how to use a compass?
我得过一枚徽章012---I have a badge in it.
真的  太棒了012---You do? That's fantastic.
你想看吗012---You want to see it?
当然想012---I'd love to,
不过我得先回去跟你的父母聊聊012---but I gotta get back to your parents.
他们在告诉我们012---They're telling us about
怎么领养你的事012---how they adopted you.
什么012---What?
怎么了012---What?
我是领养的012---I'm adopted?
我什么都不知道012---I got nothing.
第一罐马格丽塔不是太好012---Well, that first batch of margaritas was not so great...
可第二罐实在太棒...棒了012---...but this second batch is good.
希望到下一罐的时候012---Well, maybe the next batch,
我们都能喝一点012---we could all get some.
天呐  这很有趣  对吧012---Oh, God, this is fun, isn't it?
就我们四个012---You know, just the four of us.
就这么呆着012---Just hanging.
伙计  你还好吧012---Dude, are you okay?
法加它什么时候才能好012---And when are the fajitas gonna be ready?
我很好  再好不过了012---I'm fine, okay? I'm great.
我只是...我只是为我们而骄傲012---I'm just--I'm just proud of us.
一点都不古怪012---You know? There's no weirdness,
一点都不紧张012---no tension.
一点都不清醒012---No awareness.
我们是一个很好的"四人组"012---We make a great foursome.
在一起活动应该更频繁些012---We should do more stuff together.
我们去旅行吧012---Let's take a trip!
好  你觉得我们应该去哪012---Okay, where do you think we can go?
我的法加它012---My fajitas!
听着  查莉  我只想让你知道012---Look, Charlie, I just want you to know...
罗斯还需要时间012---...Ross is just having a little trouble
习惯我跟乔伊在一起012---adjusting to the thought of Joey and me.
他一般不这么喝酒的012---You know, he normally doesn't drink like this.
这没什么012---You know what, this is nothing.
我爸爸就是个疯狂的酒鬼012---My father is a raging alcoholic.
对不起012---I'm sorry,
让你们不舒服了012---have I made this evening uncomfortable?
法加它  当心  盘子很烫012---Fajitas! Be careful! Very hot plate! Very hot!
罗斯  你都没戴手套012---Ross, you don't even have oven mitts on.
明天手要疼了012---That is gonna hurt tomorrow.
好吧  这太疯狂了012---Okay, well, this is crazy.
我们不会是在讨论012---We can't seriously be talking about
把一个孩子给我  对吧012---me taking one of your kids, can we?
不  当然不是012---Oh, no, of course we're not.
-那简直是疯了  -是啊012---- That's insane. - I know.
爱丽丝不会支持的  是吗012---Alice would never go for it.Right?
我不知道  她也太累了012---I don't know. She's pretty tired too.
我想她可能会同意012---I think we could get her on board.
为了不起争执012---Well, just for argument's sake, you know,
假设说012---hypothetically...
你要放弃哪一个012---...which one would you be willing to give up?
小小弗兰克012---Frank Jr. Jr.?
你选了这么好的一个012---You'd be getting a really good one.
他真的很幽默012---He's really funny.
比如  那天他说了个笑话012---Like, the other day, he made up this joke:
什么东西是绿的并且说012---What's green and says,
"嗨  我是一只青蛙"012---"Hey, I'm a frog"?
一只会说话的青蛙012---A talking frog.
你不能带他走  他太有意思了012---Oh, no, you can't have him, he's too funny.
好吧  没关系  那莱丝莉呢012---Well, all right, that's fine. What about Leslie?
不...  不要是莱丝莉012---Oh, no, no, not Leslie. No.
她是唯一一个会012---She's the only one that knows
打着嗝说出字母表来的012---how to burp the alphabet.
好吧  那就只剩下钱德勒了012---All right, so that leaves Chandler.
噢不...  你不能带走钱德012---No, no, you can't have Chandler.
不...  她是个小天才012---No, no. She's my little genius.
我对她抱有很大期望012---I got big hopes for her.
她会成为医生或者房地产经纪人012---She's gonna be a doctor or a realtor.
弗兰克  已经没孩子可选了012---Wow, Frank, I think we just ran out of kids.
我想你是对的012---Oh, I think you're right.
菲比012---Oh, wow. Phoebe,
看来我不能放弃任何一个012---I don't think I can give one of them up.
我是说  他们让我发疯012---I mean, you know, they drive me crazy,
可他们是我的孩子012---but they're my babies.
很抱歉  弗兰克012---I'm sorry, Frank,
我没想到事情会这样012---I didn't realize things were so bad.
我会帮你的012---You know, I'll help out more.
随时可以帮你看孩子012---I can baby-sit anytime you want.
你说哪一天  我肯定会去012---You name the day and I'll be there.
明天怎么样012---How about tomorrow?
呃  不好012---Well, that's not good.
我会推掉其它事  我会到的012---But I can move some stuff around and I'll be there.
你和爱丽丝可以整天呆在一起012---You and Alice just take the whole day together.
你为我们这么做012---You'd do that for us?
你开玩笑吗012---Are you kidding?
你以为姐姐是干什么的012---That's what sisters are for.
看看他们012---Oh, look at them.
我真爱你们012---I love you so much.
天呐  别醒过来...012---Oh, crap, don't wake up...
比尔和科琳呢012---Where are Bill and Colleen?
他们在厨房弄点吃的012---They are in the kitchen, getting something to eat.
真不敢相信他们有这么好012---Can you believe how nice they are?
我们必须马上走012---We have to leave.
为什么  你在洗手间做了什么012---Why? What did you do in the bathroom?
我还没去洗手间呢012---I didn't get to the bathroom.
在路上碰到了欧文012---I bumped into Owen on the way.
可他还不知道他是被领养的012---He didn't know he was adopted.
有一丝丝的可能...012---There's a slight chance...
我已经告诉了他012---...l may have told him.
天呐  我的手袋呢012---Oh, my God, where's my purse?
不  我们把东西放在这儿012---No, I can replace everything in there.
- 拿上活页册  走  -嗨012---- Get that binder and let's go!  - Hi.
给大家的一点小茶点012---Some little snacks for everybody.
你们不用吃酸蠕虫  那是给欧文的012---You don't have to eat the sour worms. Those are for Owen.
我一会儿去叫他012---I'll go get him in a second.
顺便说一句   你们该知道012---By the way, you should know,
我们还没告诉他他是领养的012---we haven't told him he's adopted yet.
可孩子们直觉很灵敏012---But kids are so intuitive.
你不认为某种程度上他已经知道了012---Don't you think, on some level, he already knows?
-我是领养的  -看  直觉012---- I'm adopted?  - See? Intuitive.
什么  你从哪儿听来的012---What? Where did you hear that?
他告诉我的012---He told me.
他还给我50块钱让我别说出来012---And he paid me 50 dollars not to tell.
那现在你该把钱还给我了012---Which, technically, now you should give back.
你告诉他他是领养的012---You told him he's adopted?
实在对不起012---I'm sorry.
可你们应该在那儿或者什么地方写明白012---But You should have a sign out there or something.
或者在人们进门的时候悄悄告诉他们012---Or at least whisper it to people when they come in the door.
"欧文不知道他是领养的012---"Owen doesn't know he's adopted,
他也认为圣诞老人是真实存在的"012---and he also thinks Santa is real."
他不存在012---He isn't?
我们必须走了  亲爱的012---We have to get out of here, baby.

如果你不接受的话012---...we weren't gonna do anything
我们什么都不会做的012---unless you were okay with it.
很明显...012---And clearly--

好吧  那么012---Well, then...
可能现在我们都该往前看了012---...maybe it's time we all moved on.
对  不过  罗斯  你并没有完全接受012---Yeah, but, Ross, I mean, you're not okay with it, so--
不  但是我会的012---No, but I want to be.
我会的012---I will be.
