我还跟他们说明了艾玛的情况012---I've already told them about our situation with Emma...
他们答应尽力给予我方便012---...and they said they'll do whatever we need to make us feel comfortable.

郊区那所讨厌的房子012---a stupid house in the stupid suburbs.
嘿  今天下午你还说会支持的012---Earlier, you said you'd be supportive.
我变来变去的  不能相信我012---It comes and goes. I wouldn't trust it!
伙计们012---You guys, this is really,
这对我十分十分重要012---really important to me.

不  要去法国的人别靠近我012---No! Get your France-going arms away from me!
你没事儿吧012---Are you okay with this?
实际上我感到伤心012---Well, it makes me feel sad, but--
我是在问罗斯012---Talking to Ross.
知道了012---I see.
瑞秋去了另一个国家012---Rachel moving to another country?
不能每天看到她012---Not being able to see her every day?
我怎么会不难过012---How could I be okay with this?
我们又能怎么样012---But what are we gonna do?
她需要这份工作012---She really needs this job.
如果拉夫·劳伦公司请她回去012---Do you think if Ralph Lauren offered her her old job back,
她会愿意吗012---she would take it?
这怎么可能012---How's that gonna happen?
你就是这么使用你的三个魔法愿望的吗012---Is this the best way to use one of your three magic wishes?

《老友记》  第十季  第15集  艾丝特尔死了012---Friends S10E15 The One Where Estelle Dies
嘿  菲比012---Hey, Phoebe. Hey.
嘿012---Hi.
在我们打算买的那座房子旁边012---The house next door to the one
有一座房子也在出售012---that we're buying just went on the market.
我想去看看012---I wanna take a look at it,
可钱德勒不愿意012---but Chandler doesn't.
我们明天就签约了012---We close escrow tomorrow.
再看其它房子只会迷惑自己012---Seeing another house can only confuse us.
我们很容易感到迷惑012---We're easily confused.
我们并不机灵012---We're not very bright.
那如果它比我们的更好呢012---But what if it's better than ours?
至少应该看看012---Shouldn't we look?
你怎么看  菲比012---What do you think, Pheebs?
我觉得你穿这件衬衣012---Well, I think that shirt makes you look like
像雪糕餐厅的服务员012---you should work at a Baskin-Robbins.
信不信由你...012---Anyway....
乔伊的经理人是艾丝特尔·伦纳德吗012---Hey, isn't Joey's agent Estelle Leonard?
对.012---Yeah.
-她死了  -真的吗012---- She died. - You're kidding!
-真糟糕   -是的  在上个星期六012---- That's terrible. - Yeah, last Saturday.
哇  她是第一个独自驾机012---Wow! She was the first black man
飞越大西洋的黑人男性012---to fly solo across the Atlantic!
哦  等等  我看串行了012---Wait a minute, I read the wrong one.
哦012---Oh, yeah?
对  是那个经纪人012---Yeah, she was just an agent.
乔伊肯定感到很难过012---Joey's gonna be so upset.
是的  他一直希望成为012---I know. He always wanted to be
第一个独自驾机飞越大西洋的黑人男性012---the first black man to cross the Atlantic.
我们不能让乔伊知道这件事012---We cannot tell Joey about this.
一切都在改变012---He's already flipping out
他都快要发疯了012---about everything changing.
不能再刺激他了012---This'll push him over the edge.
你真的认为我们不应该告诉他吗012---You don't think we should tell him?
至少暂时不说012---Not for a while.
给他几天012---Let's just give him a few days
先消化已经发生了的事012---to get used to everything else.
如果他从报纸上看到呢012---What if he reads the paper?
除非是八卦的史努比告诉查理·布朗012---Unless Snoopy says it to Charlie Brown,
否则就没问题012---I think we're okay.
有什么事吗012---May I help you?
我是瑞秋·格林的朋友012---Yeah. I'm a friend of Rachel Green's.
我们两年前在圣诞派对上见过面012---Actually, we met at the Christmas party about two years ago.
-哦  是唐   -差不多  是罗恩012---- Oh, right. Don? - Close. Ron.
有什么能帮忙的吗012---Well, what can I do for you?
想了解一下012---Well, I'm here to see
能不能恢复瑞秋的工作012---if you'll give Rachel her job back.
是她让你来的吗012---Did she ask you to come here and do this?
不  如果你同意了012---First I have to get you to agree...
我还要问问她是否愿意回来012---...then we'll see if she wants to come back.
哇  这真吸引人012---Wow, that is tempting.
她很喜欢这份工作012---She loved her job here.
实际上  你找不到比她更好的人选012---Let's face it, you're not gonna find anyone...
是这样吗012---...who did it as well as she did. Isn't that true?
-是很不错   -我真没料到012---- She is good. - I took a shot there.
可是  很抱歉  我无能为力012---But I'm sorry, there's nothing I can do.
事实是  我不想出力012---Oh, that's not true. There's nothing I want to do.
好的012---I see.
非常谢谢012---Thanks very much.
-是你儿子吗   -对  他叫罗斯012---- Is this your son? - Yeah, his name is Ross.
怎么了012---What?
没什么  跟罗恩发音很接近嘛012---Nothing, it's just that it's close to Ron.
这小罗斯有可能对恐龙有兴趣吗012---Does little Ross like dinosaurs, by any chance?
是的  他老是说起  那又怎么样012---Yeah, they're all he talks about. Why?
他是否愿意012---How would he like to
和我到自然历史博物馆012---come with me to the Museum of Natural History...
在其他人都离开之后012---...after everyone else has left,
就剩我们两个012---just the two of us...
他想摸哪里就摸哪里012---...and he can touch anything he wants?
我说的话  我自己也听到了  有歧义了012---I just heard it how you must have heard it, and that's not good.
让我再说一遍   我是古生物学家012---Let me start again. I'm a paleontologist.
你也可以在场  摸的只会是骨头...化石012---You'll be there with us, and the touching refers only to bones-- fossils!
你真的可以安排到吗012---You could really arrange that?
如果你能让瑞秋回来  那就这么定了012---You let Rachel come back and it's done.
我想  让瑞秋回来  不见得就是坏事012---I guess having Rachel back wouldn't be the worst thing in the world.
太好了  十分感谢012---Yes! Thank you! This is great! Thank you so much.
我保证  这是你的孩子会高兴死的012---I swear, your kid's gonna have the time of his life.
太好了  我对他挺担心的012---That's great. I worry about little Ross.
他老是捧着书本012---He's always reading,
收集石头  完全被恐龙给迷住了012---collecting rocks and he's obsessed with dinosaurs.
他会正常的012---He'll be fine!
- 嘿  菲比  - 嘿012---- Hey, Pheebs. - Hey.
你怎么了012---Everything okay?
我在生我经纪人的气012---I'm just mad at my agent.
艾丝特尔  为什么012---Estelle? Why?
有一部电视电影 其中的角色很合适我演012---There's a part in this TV movie that I would be perfect for...
她没有推荐我去  她最好有个好的借口012---...and I didn't even get put up for it. She better have a good reason.
我想她有的012---I'm guessing she does.
我想听听  她老是这样012---Well, I wanna hear it, because she keeps doing this.
噢  等等  我要先走了012---No, wait, wait, wait! All right, I gotta go.
答应我  等一会再打给她012---Just listen. Promise me that you will wait a minute before you call her.
为什么012---Well, okay. Why?
因为  朋友之间的诺言  从不需要有原因012---Because a promise between friends means never having to give a reason.
我喜欢这句话012---I love that saying!
-嗨   -乔伊  我是艾丝特尔012---- Hello? - Joey, it's Estelle.
我正想打电话给你  真古怪012---I was just gonna call you. That's weird.
这是巧合  但是可信012---It's a little coincidental, but believable.
我想你肯定想知道012---Listen, I'm sure you're wondering
我为什么没有安排你012---why I didn't get you...
为那部电视电影试镜012---...an audition for that TV movie.
是的  确实是的012---Yeah, actually I am.
我想我失职了012---I guess I dropped the ball there.
就这样012---That's it?
我最近老是失职012---You know, it seems like all you do lately is drop the ball.
不要这么和我说话012---Don't take that tone with me.
你以为自己是谁012---Who do you think you are?
阿兰·莱蒙012---Alan Lemon,
第一个独自驾机飞越大西洋的黑人男性012---the first black man to fly solo across the Atlantic?
听我说  你是我的经纪人012---No, look, all I'm saying is you're my agent...
但是你没有为我争取到试镜机会012---...and you're not getting me any auditions
我受够了012---and I'm tired of it.
你这样说什么意思012---What are you saying?
我意思是  不能再这样了  艾丝特尔012---I'm saying that this isn't working for me anymore, okay, Estelle?
你被解雇了  再见012---You're fired. Goodbye.
噢  艾丝特尔这个星期真倒霉012---Man, tough week for Estelle.
-嗨  -嗨012---- Hi. - Hi.
艾玛把这忘在我那了012---Emma left her stuffed T. Rex at my house.
没这她可睡不着哦012---You know she can't sleep without it.
嗯  她现在在睡觉呢012---Well, she's asleep now.
别再塞这玩意儿给她012---Stop forcing that thing on her.
好的012---Okay.
哦  你绝对不会相信今天发生的事012---You're not gonna believe what happened to me today!
拉夫·劳伦公司打电话请我回去012---Ralph Lauren called and gave me my job back!
-不会吧   -好奇怪啊012---- No! - I mean, it was the weirdest thing.
他们先是解雇我  然后又无缘无故重新聘用我012---They fire me and then out of nowhere, they just hire me back.
一定是没我就不行了012---I mean, that place must just be falling apart without me!
那么  你不去巴黎了吧012---So you're not going to Paris?
去呀  我还去012---No, I'm still going!
什么...012---What?
好吧  当路易威登公司发现012---Well, when the Louis Vuitton people found out...
拉夫·劳伦公司请我回去012---...that Ralph Lauren wanted me back,
他们就提高了我的报酬012---they offered me more money!
罗斯  是不是太棒了012---Ross, isn't that great?
我们有意买下旁边的那座房子012---Hi. We're buying the house next door.
允许我们参观一下这里吗012---Could we just take a look around?
当然可以012---Sure,
我刚好带人来参观012---I'm showing it to someone else right now,
你们进来吧012---but please, look around.
我感到这是对我们房子的不忠012---I feel like we're cheating on our house.
如果不忠的话  我们不也应该012---If we cheat, shouldn't it
一些事情老房子不会做012---be with a hot, younger house...
一个会做的年轻漂亮的房子来不忠吗012---...that does stuff that our house won't do?
我们的比这里更棒012---Ours is so much better!
客厅更小012---This living room is smaller,
饭厅像个洞穴012---the dining room looks like a cave.
真受不了012---What a hole!
-你们觉得怎么样   -喜欢012---- So, what do you think? - Love it!
我们本来有一位买家012---We already have one offer.
楼上的女士是另一位012---I think the lady upstairs will make another one.
是我们将来的邻居  他们是什么样的012---They could be our neighbors. What are they like?
楼上这位女士很好012---The woman upstairs is nice.
她和丈夫有2个小孩012---She and her husband have two kids.
丈夫在华尔街工作  她是...012---He's on Wall Street, and she's a--
哦...天...啊...012---Oh... my... God!
没错012---Sure.
乔伊  你想和我去...012---Hey, Joey, you wanna come with me to--?
你怎么啦012---Are you okay?
我为解雇艾丝特尔的事难过012---Yeah, I just feel bad about firing Estelle.
她肯定伤心死了012---This has gotta be killing her.
她不会因此死的012---No, that wouldn't kill her.
冠状动脉栓塞有可能012---A coronary embolism might.
她心都碎了  我是她唯一的客户012---I don't know. She's gotta be taking it hard. I was her only client.
那个会吃纸的家伙除外012---Except for this guy who eats paper.
我猜他吃的钱比挣得多012---And I'm guessing he eats more money than he makes.
我明白她不是优秀的经纪人012---Look, I know she's not a great agent,
但我们合作10年了012---but she did stick with me for 10 years.
我要给她打电话  重新雇佣她012---I'm gonna call her and hire her again.
不...  不要给她打电话012---No, no, no! Don't call her.
-你等她给你打电话   -为什么012---- You wait for her to call you. - Why?
耐心是通向理解的大道012---Because patience is the road to understanding.
那是得到快乐的关键012---Which is the key to a happy heart.
你真让人吃惊  我服了012---You blow me away.
答应我  你等她给你打电话012---All right, so promise you're gonna wait for her to call you?
-我答应你   -好的012---- I promise. - Okay.
这意味着  从不需要有原因012---And that means never having to give a reason.
这世界真小呀012---What a small world!
我还没碰到过碧昂丝012---And yet I never run into Beyonce.
你们认识012---You two know each other?
我们是老交情了012---We go way back.
在莫妮卡认识他之前012---Before Monica made an honest man out of him...
钱德勒曾经是我的小甜甜012---...Chandler used to be my little love muffin.
这么说  你们也要想买下一座房子012---So are you guys thinking of getting this house too?
如果是要投标竞价的话012---Are we gonna have a bidding war?
我可要警告你了  我是流氓我怕谁012---I better warn you, I'm a toughie.
别...012---Don't...
别这样012---Don't do that.
其实我们打算买下隔壁那座房子012---No, actually, we are buying the house next door.
为什么012---Why?
我不知道为什么012---I don't know why.
那就这么定了   本来我还在犹豫012---Oh, that decides it, then! I was on the fence.
没想到我们会成为邻居012---But knowing that you two would be our neighbors?
那我就买下来了012---Now we have to get it!
艾伦  我们去定下价钱012---Ellen, we're gonna talk numbers.
怎么会搞成这样012---This cannot be happening.
经纪人不是说还有 另外一对夫妇有意购买吗012---The realtor said another couple made an offer.
珍妮斯可能就买不成了012---Maybe the Janices won't get it!
另外的夫妇可能会买下012---Maybe the other couple will.
这绝不可能发生012---The only way that'll happen is
除非那是希特勒夫妇012---if the other couple are the Hitlers!
我们两座房子都买下来  怎么样012---Okay, okay! All right, what if we get both houses?
将这里作为家庭旅馆012---We can turn this one into a guesthouse!
真是好主意012---That's a great idea!
我不是想招讨厌012---By the way, I don't mean to sound distasteful...
但你从什么时候开始爱乱花钱了012---...but when did you start crapping money?
-好呀  那你来想办法  -好啊012---- You come up with an idea. - All right.
还有3个小时才签约012---We've still got three hours till escrow closes on our house.
我们现在取消还来得及012---We can still get out.
我们喜欢这座房子012---But we love our house.
你也同样喜欢住在她隔壁吗012---Will we love it so much with her next door?
她还会在这大声嚷嚷012---And she's gonna be louder out here too!
讨厌的"噢...天...啊..."012---Just the crickets and, "Oh... my... God!"
即使我们不买这座房子012---Okay. But if we don't get this house,
她还是会在我们面前出现012---she'll still show up wherever we go.
她住在这012---At least if she's here,
起码不会再吓我们一跳012---it eliminates the element of surprise.
你不会再听到那3个字012---Never again will you have to hear the three words...
连你的蛋蛋都被吓得缩进去012---...that make your balls jump back up inside your body!
我们得想想办法012---Well, we have to do something.
不能就让她住在隔壁012---We can't have her living next door.
嗯  这也会012---Oh, that does it too.
谁012---Who is it?
是我  罗恩012---It's me. Ron.
我知道瑞秋拒绝你了012---Look, I know Rachel turned you down...
不过我有一个法子能让她会来012---...but I think there's a way you might be able to get her to come back.
请你别见怪012---This may surprise you,
重新聘用已经解雇的员工  不是我主要的工作012---but rehiring fired employees is not my main job.
先听我说012---Just hear me out.
给她提高薪酬  你认为怎么样012---How would you feel about offering her a raise?
不好  罗恩012---Not good, Ron.
可能我会说服你012---Perhaps I can persuade you.
你希望送给你儿子012---What if you could give your son...
这么一只恐龙蛋复制品吗012---...this genuine pterodactyl egg replica.
哇  这很不错呀012---Wow! That's pretty cool.
这么说  我们成交了012---So? Do we have a deal?
-好的  你成功了  -太好了012---- Okay, you got it. - Yes! Yes!
这会让我很受欢迎012---This is gonna make me very popular.
相信我  女士都喜欢它012---Believe me, the ladies, they love it.
我指的是我儿子012---I meant with my son.
对  女士对它不感兴趣012---Good, because the ladies, not so much.
乔伊  我是阿尔·则布克  那个吃纸的人012---Joey, this is Al Zebooker, the guy who eats paper.
相信你听说了艾丝特尔过世的消息012---I'm sure you've heard that Estelle passed away.
我通知你参加追悼会012---I wanted to let you know there's a memorial for her...
在韦斯特赛德教堂  明天10点012---...at the Westside Chapel tomorrow at 1O.
希望你能来012---Hope you can make it.
我的天啊012---Oh, my God.
-你好  -乔伊  我是艾丝特尔012---- Hello? - Joey, it's Estelle.
艾丝特尔012---Estelle?
我打电话是要告诉你012---Yeah, I wanted to call and tell you
我没有因为你解雇我而感到伤心012---that there's no hard feelings for firing me.
好的  真难以置信你会打电话给我012---Okay. I just-- I can't believe you're calling me.
我觉得我不应该贸然造访012---I didn't think I should just drop by.
不  不要来访012---No, no! Don't drop by! Don't drop by!
总之  你做了你必须做的是  我没意见012---Anyway, you did what you had to do. I'm okay.
能问你个问题吗012---Can I ask you something?
你那边怎么样012---What's it like there?
还凑合012---It's all right.
我要挂了  祝你好运012---Look, kiddo, I gotta go.
你会飞黄腾达的012---Good luck with the career. You're gonna be huge!
谢谢你艾丝特尔  再见012---Thanks for everything, Estelle. Bye.
不在服务区  那肯定的012---"Out of area." Boy, I'll say!
我刚才打给西德了012---Well, I just talked to Sid.
我们要买下这座房子012---We are definitely putting in an offer on the house.
一定会成功的012---And I'll bet we get it!
