你得多骄傲啊012---oh, so proudly?
我还没决定放在哪里012---I haven't really settled on a spot yet.
那不如放在电视机上面吧012---How about right above the TV?
这样的话  人们一进门012---That way, it will be the first thing that you see
就马上看得到了012---when you walk in the door.
好啊  好啊012---Yeah, yeah,
那你就可以丢掉那法国的海报了012---and you can get rid of that French poster.

慢慢地...012---...she slowly reaches up...
扭开门把手012---...and turns your doorknob.
拿走这没脚的妖怪012---Get that legless witch out of here!

你的前男友是个疯子012---Your ex-boyfriend is insane.
随便啦  你得到那笔资金了吗012---Did you get the grant?
没有  你想知道为什么吗012---No. And you wanna know why?
因为你的前男友还是爱着你012---Because your ex-boyfriend is still in love with you.
-什么  -没错012---- What? - Yeah.
他没有给我那笔补助012---He wouldn't give me the grant,
就因为我没有放弃你012---because I wouldn't give you up.
本杰不会还爱着我的012---Benji isn't in love with me.
因为当时是他抛弃我012---I mean, he broke up with me.
而且  他是个很有道德的人012---And besides, he's a very ethical man.
是吗012---Really?
在面谈中问这种问题012---Is it ethical to ask someone in a grant review:
《超狗任务》中谁给狗配音012---"Who was the voice of Underdog?"
我肯定他是在开玩笑  罗斯012---I'm sure he was just joking, Ross.
如果你不相信我  我们去找他对质吧012---If you don't believe me, let's go talk to him.
可以告诉你012---I'm telling you,
他没有问过我一个关于考古学的问题012---he didn't ask me one paleontological question.
真的吗012---Seriously?
哦  不是  他问了我一个012---Oh, I'm sorry. No, he did ask me one:
怎么拼"boscodictiosaur"012---"How do you spell Boscodictiasaur?"
和刚果的巴斯克湖拼法一样012---Well, if it's like the Lake Mbosco in Congo,
那是M...B...O...012---then M-B-O--
可恶012---Damn it.
盖勒博士...  查莉  你们到这来干什么012---Dr. Geller. Charlie, what are you doing here?
我要你告诉他一切012---I want you to tell her everything.
告诉他你想和我做的交易012---About the deal you tried to make with me,
那些神经病的问题012---about the crazy questions you--
沃利·考克斯  他就是《超狗任务》的配音012---Wally Cox. That's the voice of Underdog.
就如之前的调查我告诉你一样012---Like I tried to tell you in the interview...
这笔资金不是为了012---...this grant is not based on
这些无聊的知识而设的012---your knowledge of pretty useless trivia.
不  不  不  别这样012---No, don't do that.
我要你看着她的眼睛012---I want you to look her in the eyes
告诉她真相012---and tell her the truth.
本杰012---Benji?
是的  的确是这样012---All right. It's true.
我之前简直是乱来012---I behaved horribly,
但这都是因为我还爱着你012---but it's only because I still love you.
只要你回到我身边012---And I would do anything
我可以做任何事012---to have you back in my life.
早干嘛去了  本杰012---Too little, too late, Benji.
我不敢相信012---I can't believe this.
我真不应该离开你012---I never should've broken up with you.
我无时无刻不在想你012---I think about you all the time.
难道你就从来没想过我吗012---Do you ever still think about me?
没有012---No.
-有  -什么012---- Yes. - What?
我不知道该说什么好了  本杰012---I don't know what to say, Benji.
这一切实在太...012---This is all so...
浪漫了012---...romantic.
或者...012---Or?
我知道  或者我做得太过火了012---I know I may be way out of bounds here...
但我们还有机会在一起吗012---...but is there any chance you would take me back?
或者可以...012---Maybe.
甜心  你们的对话012---Sweetie, this conversation is starting to
让我觉得有点不舒服了012---make me a little uncomfortable.
天啊  我很抱歉  但...012---Oh, God. I am so sorry, but--
我是说...我们之前有太多的过去了...012---I mean, there's so much history between us, you know?
我也觉得抱歉...012---I'm sorry too.
我爱你012---I love you.
我也爱你012---I love you too.
好吧就这样  我们都可以找下家了012---Okay, that's it, we are seeing other people.
格拉达斯012---Gladys?
这个星期的第三次了012---For the third time this week.
天啊  真是常玩常新啊012---Man, this does not get old.
你真可恶012---You're mean!
不要这么孩子气啦012---Oh, don't be such a baby. Please.
