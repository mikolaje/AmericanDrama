那些滥地方  人总是挤的满满当当012---Oh, those places! There's always so many people,
跟牛群被关进栅栏似的012---and they're being corralled like cattle.
还有  那儿总是有些傻瓜学牛叫012---And, you know, there's always some idiot who goes, "Moo."
要是那这么惹你烦012---Well, if it annoys you so much,

是的  他们说他会好的012---Yeah, he's gonna be fine,
但还是打了很多镇静剂012---but he's heavily sedated.

真高兴见到你们012---It's really nice to meet you guys.
我都不敢相信来到这儿了012---I can't believe I'm here.
欢迎来到纽约  或者我应该说012---Well, welcome to New York City, or should I say:
你干吗要说那个012---Why would you say that?
你们今天打算干什么012---Okay. What are you gonna be doing today?

我是罗斯·盖勒博士012---And I'm Dr. Ross Geller.
罗斯  行了吧  这里是医院012---Ross, please, this is a hospital.
这词儿在这儿是有其他意义的012---That actually means something here.
-那么  我们能进去吗   -当然012---- So can we please go in? - Absolutely.
瑞秋  我想我还是等在外面吧012---Rach, I think I'm gonna wait out here...
我的喉咙有点痒012---...because my throat is feeling a little scratchy.
我不想传染给他012---I don't wanna infect him.
罗斯  得了  别那么怕他012---Ross, please. Don't be so scared of him.
我不是怕他  我真的病了012---I am not scared of him. I'm really sick.
镇静剂药效还没退012---He's under sedation,
所以他还在昏睡着012---so he's pretty much out.
我感觉好多了012---I'm feeling better.
我的天啊012---Oh, my God.
我给他买的耳毛和鼻毛剪012---That ear and nose hair trimmer I got him
算是白花钱了012---was just money down the drain, huh?
格林小姐012---Ms. Green?
你爸爸的医生在电话上012---Your father's doctor's on the phone
你要不要跟他谈谈012---if you'd like to speak to him.
哦  好的  呃  你在这等着没事吧012---Oh, great. Are you gonna be okay?
他还不省人事  我想我们没事儿012---He's unconscious. We'll be just fine.
好012---Okay.
-是不是电视吧你吵醒了   -不是012---- Did the TV wake you? - No.
你把脚翘到我床上012---When you put your feet up on my bed,
压住我的导尿管了012---you tugged on my catheter.
你来这儿干吗012---What are you doing here, Geller?
我和瑞秋一块儿来的012---Well, I came with Rachel,
她一会儿就回来012---who should be back any second.
最近怎么样012---So, what's new?
哦  我得了点儿心脏病012---Oh, I had a little heart attack.
是吧  疼吗012---Right. Is it painful?
什么  你是指心脏病012---What, the heart attack
还是指在这跟你聊天012---or sitting here talking to you?
看看能不能把瑞秋叫过来012---Let's see if we can get that Rachel back in here.
那你最近怎么样012---So, what's new with you?
是不是又让我别的女儿也怀孕了012---Knocked up any more of my daughters lately?
没有  只有那一个  瑞秋012---Nope. Just the one. Rach!
不对012---No!
好吧  也许我们应该拆散了试试012---Okay, maybe if we just break it down.
好吧  我们试试一次一个音节012---Okay, let's try it one syllable at a time.
好的  跟我念012---Okay, so repeat after me.
很好  快一点012---Great! Okay, faster.
好吧  这太难了  我教不了你012---Okay, it's too hard. I can't teach you.
你干吗012---What are you doing?
我得走了012---I have to go
不然我要拿你的头撞墙了012---before I put your head through a wall.
不  别走  我需要你012---Don't go, I need you!
我明天就要试镜了012---My audition is tomorrow!
嘿  我本来想做晚饭的012---Hey. I was gonna make us some dinner...
但是你爸的冰箱里012---...but all I found in your dad's fridge
只有培根和奶油012---was bacon and heavy cream.
我想我们找到012---I think we solved
他得心脏病的原因了012---the mystery of the heart attack.
你给你父母打电话了吗012---Did you call your parents?
哦  打过了  艾玛很好012---Oh, yeah. Emma's doing great.
哦  好012---Oh, good.
-怎么  -只是不敢相信012---- What? - I just can't believe...
我在瑞秋·格林的房间里012---...I'm in Rachel Green's room.
你什么意思012---What do you mean?
你以前到过我的房间012---You've been in my room before.
可不是012---Yeah, sure, right.
就跟我真来过瑞秋·格林房间似的012---Like I'd ever be in Rachel Green's room.
好吧  我得跟你说012---Okay, I gotta tell you,
你叫我的全名可真有点儿怪012---it's really weird when you use my whole name.
对不起012---Sorry.
-你还好吧  -还行012---- You okay? - Yeah.
-今天太累了  是吧  -是啊012---- Yeah, you had a rough day. - Yeah.
看到他那个样子很奇怪  你知道吗012---It's just so weird seeing him like that, you know?
我是说  他是个医生012---I mean, he's a doctor.
医生怎么会得病的呢012---You don't expect doctors to get sick.
但我们确实会得病012---But we do.
他会好的  瑞秋012---He's gonna be okay, Rach.
我不想让他醒来一个人012---I don't want him to wake up alone.
我得去医院012---I should go to the hospital.
什么  不  等等  嘿  你看012---What? No, no. Hey, hey, look.
什么012---What?
他服了很多镇静药012---They gave him a lot of medication.
他甚至都不会知道你在不在那儿012---He wouldn't even know if you were there.
我们明天一早就去看他  好吗012---We'll go see him first thing in the morning. Ok?
真的  我不去也不用于心有愧012---Really? I shouldn't feel guilty?
不用  天啊  嘿012---No-- God, hey.
瑞秋  你是个好女儿  知道吗012---Rach, you've been an amazing daughter, okay?
现在  你需要好好休息一下012---Right now you need to get some rest.
好吧  也许你说得对012---Okay, maybe you're right.
晚安012---Good night.
等等...012---Wait, wait, wait.
你能不能在这012---Would you stay here
陪我呆一会儿012---with me for a little while?
-当然  -好012---- Sure. - Okay.
谢谢你今天陪我来012---Thank you for coming with me today.
哦  应该的012---Oh, of course.
瑞秋·格林很高兴你在她房间里012---Rachel Green is very happy you're in her room.
我也很高兴  来012---Me too. Come here.
我只是不想晚上一个人在这儿012---I just don't wanna be alone tonight.
那好012---Okay, well,
我可以找条睡袋什么的...012---I can maybe grab a sleeping bag or--
不行  瑞秋012---No, Rach!
抱歉012---I'm sorry,
我只是觉得这样不好012---I just don't think this is a good idea.
我们不做怎么知道好不好012---Well, we won't know that until we do it,
对吧012---will we?
不  你看  嗯…012---No, look, uh.
你为你父亲的事儿心烦012---You are upset about your father,
你现在很脆弱012---and you're feeling vulnerable...
而且我觉得这时候012---...and I just don't feel it
这么做不对012---would be right.
我会觉得012---I feel like I'd be, you know,
这是在占你便宜012---taking advantage of you.
什么 占便宜012---What--? Taking advantage?
我在主动投怀送抱  你尽兴好啦012---I am giving you the advantage. Enjoy!
我知道肯定会很美妙...012---Look, I'm sure it would be great...
但我认为我们俩得有一个保持清醒012---...but I think one of us has to be thinking clearly.
所以我要走了012---So I'm gonna go.
好吧012---Okay.
明天早上见012---I'll see you in the morning.
我都4个月没有做爱了012---I haven't had sex in four months.
我刚才的高姿态应该得块奖章012---I should get a medal for that!
谢谢你们带我去了那么多地方012---Thanks so much for taking me to all those places.
我玩得很高兴012---I had a great time.
哦  我也很高兴012---I'm glad.
但是  我得为钱德勒道歉012---Listen, I wanna apologize about Chandler, though.
我没想到他会这样012---I just did not see this coming.
纽约可真棒012---New York is awesome!
你怎么回事儿012---What is with you?
你知道吗  我以前去过那些地方012---You know, I've been to these places before...
但是我都没有好好看过风景012---...but I've never really seen them.
没错  你学牛叫的时候错过好多风景012---Yeah, you miss a lot when you're mooing.
非常感谢你们带我观光012---Thank you for showing me around.
哦  我们很高兴陪你去012---Oh, it was our pleasure.
我们也想跟你熟悉熟悉012---We're so much enjoying getting to know you.
呃  你们还有什么想了解的吗012---Well, if there's anything else you wanna know....
好吧012---Okay.
你不会介意我问几个012---Can we ask you some questions
有关孩子父亲的问题吧012---about the father?
哦  没关系012---Oh, sure. Yeah.
他是我高中的男朋友012---Well, he was my high-school boyfriend,
足球队长  很可爱012---captain of the football team, really cute.
后来他得到奖学金  上了大学012---Got a scholarship and went to college.
那不错啊012---That's great.
是啊  差不多就是他了012---Yeah, it's almost definitely him.
那怎么说012---How's that, now?
也有可能是另外一个人012---Well, there's a chance it's another guy.
我是说  我只跟两个人好过012---I mean, I've only ever been with two guys...
但是时间上有些重叠012---...but they sort of overlapped.
那么  另一个人是干什么的012---So, what does the other guy do?
他也上大学了吗012---Does he go to college too?
不  他在蹲监狱012---No, he's in prison.
那他是被诬告的吧012---Was he falsely accused of something?
不012---No.
他用铁铲杀了他爸爸012---He killed his father with a shovel.
但是除此之外  他还是个不错的人012---Other than that, he's a great guy.
我猜他爸爸不这么想012---I'll bet his dad doesn't think so.
-你醒着呢吗   -我当然还醒着012---- Are you awake? - Of course I'm awake.
从今往后我是睡不着啦012---Assume from now on that I'm always awake.
好啦  我们也不确定就一定是他012---All right, we don't know that it's him.
我是说  也可能是那个踢足球的012---I mean, it could be the football guy.
亲爱的  我们这对儿倒霉蛋012---Honey, it's us.
肯定是摊上那个铁铲杀手012---Of course it's the shovel killer.
好了  好了  就算是他012---Well, all right, let's say that it is him.
我们就不要这孩子了  不012---Would we not want the baby? No.
我们会对他另眼相待吗012---Would we treat him any differently?
我会一直提防着他的012---I'd keep an eye on him.
我们一定得查出哪一个是孩子的父亲012---We have to find out who the father is.
-怎么查  -我不知道012---- How? - I don't know.
这种事儿可以测出来的  对吧012---They have tests for these things, right?
是  不过我们也许反应过度了012---Yes, but maybe we're just overreacting.
你说得当然轻巧012---Easy for you to say.
他杀的是他爸爸012---He's a father killer.
他没准儿很爱他老妈012---He probably loves his mommy.
他没准儿在挥铲子的胳膊上012---He's probably got a tattoo
刺着"妈妈"呢012---that says "Mom" on his shovel-wielding arm.
"现在我们从一数到五"012---We'll now count from one to five.
-"说得真好"  -谢谢012---- Good job. - Thank you.
-嘿  -嘿  乔伊012---- Hey. - Hey, Joey.
听我说  昨天的事儿我觉得不太好012---Listen, I feel really badly about yesterday,
我想了很多012---and I thought about it a lot.
我想是我太没有耐心了012---No, I was too impatient.
所以  我们今天再试试012---So let's try it again.
哦不  不用了  我不用你帮忙了012---That's okay. I don't need your help.
我可以自学012---I worked on it myself,
而且我得说我学得还不错嘞012---and I gotta say I am pretty good.
真的  说几句给我听听012---Really, can I hear some of it?
当然可以012---Sure, sure.
好012---Okay.
怎么样012---See?
好吧  你说的不是...012---You, you're not--
你不是在...012---You're not-- You're--
我再次重申  你说的不是法语012---Again, you're not speaking French!
哦  我觉着我说的是法语012---Oh, well, I think I am.
而且我肯定能得到那个角色012---Yeah, and I think I'm definitely gonna get the part.
你怎么会这么想的012---How could you possibly think that?
至少012---For one thing.
磁带上的那家伙说012---The guy on the tape
我念得不错012---said I was doing a good job!
嗨  瑞秋  给我倒杯咖啡好吗012---Hey, Rach, can you grab me a cup of coffee?
当然可以012---Sure.
你一早上话不多012---You've been quiet all morning.
没事儿吧012---Is everything okay?
-你肯定没事  -当然012---- You sure you're all right? - Yep.
好012---Okay.
好吧  那我去买点早饭012---Well, I'm gonna go grab us some breakfast.
有个意见供你参考012---FYI.
得  来啦012---There it is.
以后012---In the future...
如果有女孩子需要点不理智的安慰性的爱爱012---...when a girl asks for some ill-advised sympathy sex,
你就满足她好啦012---just do it.
等等  你是因为昨晚的事儿生我的气012---Wait, wait, you're mad at me about last night?
我只是想做对的事012---I was just trying to do the right thing.
真的012---Really?
对我来说012---It seems to me.
要是你做得对的话012---If you had done the right thing...
我就不会一早醒来012---...l wouldn't have woken up
感觉又愚蠢又尴尬012---feeling stupid and embarrassed.
我只会觉得舒适而满意012---I would've woken up feeling comforted and satisfied.
-呃...  -哦  得了吧012---- Well-- - Oh, stop that!
我不敢相信  你怎么...012---I can't believe this. What you...
我只是做了回好人012---I was just being a good guy.
我以尊重和同情之心待你012---I treated you with respect and understanding.
啊  那可真性感012---Oh, that is so hot.
嘿  我是在为你着想012---Hey, I was looking out for you.
哦  真的  罗斯012---Oh, really? Well, Ross,
你要知道  我不是个小丫头012---you know what? I am a big girl.
我不需要有人告诉我012---I don't need someone telling me
什么对我来说最好012---what is best for me.
虽说以前我也经常没过成性生活012---I gotta say, I've not had sex a lot of times before.
但这次是最糟糕的012---This is the worst ever!
哦  真的  真的012---Oh, really? Really?
