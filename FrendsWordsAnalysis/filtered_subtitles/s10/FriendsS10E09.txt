-嘿   -嘿012---- Hey.  - Hey.
我们来道别012---We're here to say goodbye.
要去俄亥俄州012---We're off to Ohio.
对哦  领养面谈012---Oh, right, your adoption interview.
是啊  我们去见未来我们孩儿他妈012---Yep. We'll meet the lady who could be carrying our baby.
难以置信  你们回来时012---I can't believe it. When you come back,
会带着婴儿  太奇怪了012---you'll have a baby. That is so weird.
也很不正确012---And so incorrect.
她只怀孕几个月012---She's only a couple months pregnant.
她选中了我们的申请表012---She liked our application
是否喜欢我们还不一定012---but might not like us.
她会喜欢你们的012---Come on, she's gonna love you guys.
谢谢012---Thank you.
但我们尽量不期望过高012---But we're trying not to get our hopes up.
还有很多事情挡在我们面前012---A lot could still get in our way.
她可能会决定拒绝把孩子给人领养012---She could decide against adoption,
也可能选中其他夫妇012---like another couple better.
你们打算给小孩取啥名字012---What are you gonna name it?
我就有这个本事012---I could develop a condition
费尽口舌012---in which I talk and talk
而旁人却充耳不闻012---and no one hears a word.
试想  如果一切顺利012---But just think, okay? What if everything goes right?
如果她真选了你们俩呢012---What if this woman does pick you guys?
天  那她就会选我们012---Oh, my God. She's gonna pick us!
我们决心012---So we're standing firm on
决不期望过高012---"not getting our hopes up"?
我明白  有可能出差错012---No. I know things could still go wrong,
但万一顺利012---but if they don't...
如果没有问题012---...if this works out,
我们就会有孩子了  孩子012---we're gonna have a baby. A baby!
是的  但是...012---Yes. But--
会成功的012---Oh, my God. It's gonna work!
我们会成功的012---We're gonna make it work!
我要当妈妈012---I'm gonna be a mommy,
你要当爸爸012---and you're gonna be a daddy!
回见了  你们这群笨蛋012---All right, I'll see you suckers.
我要去领个娃娃了012---I'm gonna go get me a baby!
管它呢  我要当爹啦012---Screw it. I'm gonna be a daddy!
《老友记》  第十季  第9集 去见孩儿他妈012---Friends S10E09 The One With The Birth Mother

那是莎拉012---Oh, that's Sarah.
不  你少打我朋友的主意012---No. Don't you get any ideas.
我再也不给你012---I'm not setting you up with
撮合我的朋友了012---any more of my friends.
为什么  为什么012---Why? Why?
因为你约一个睡一个012---Because you'll date her once...
然后就把人家忘到九霄云外012---...sleep with her, then forget she exists.
举例说明一下012---Name one friend of yours I did that with.
-曼蒂  -曼蒂啊012---- Mandy.  - Mandy, huh?
金发大胸辣妹012---Really hot blond, big boobs?
错012---No.
难怪我记不住她012---Might be why I don't remember, huh?
你好象把我当别人了012---Do you think I'm someone else?
过去我也许012---Look, I may not have treated
待你朋友不好012---your friends well in the past.
但我现在成熟多了012---But I have grown up a lot.
真的  是吧  瑞秋012---Really. Honest. Rach?
信不信由你  是真的012---Yeah, believe it or not, it's true.
乔伊和我交往的时候很乖012---I mean, when Joey and I were together...
非常好012---...he was wonderful.
体贴成熟012---He was thoughtful and mature.
我们交往那一周012---And for the one week that we went out...
他都没和其他女人上床012---...he didn't sleep with anybody else.
成长012---Growth.
好  给你她的电话号码012---Fine, I'll give you her number.
谢谢你012---Okay. Thank you.
我保证我不会忘记这个012---And I promise you I will not forget this one.

帽子好看吗012---How does this look?
有点...  有点低  戴高点012---Well, it's-- It's a little low. Pick it up a little.
再高012---A little bit more.
再高012---A little bit more.
好了012---There you go.
扔一边去012---Now throw it away.
别这样  这帽子多好看012---Come on! This looks good.
罗斯  相信我012---Ross, please trust me.
我一个月买30本时尚杂志012---I buy 30 fashion magazines a month.
我可能不清楚谁想竞选总统012---Now I don't know who's running for president
或是北约那些人都是谁对谁012---or who that NATO guy is...
但我知道012---...but I do know that
你该离那帽子越远越妙012---you have to get far away from that hat.
见鬼012---Damn it. God....
明晚我要约会012---I have this date tomorrow night,
我得扮帅才行012---and I have to look cool.

明天我和瑞秋要去购物012---Rachel and l are going shopping tomorrow.
欢迎同去012---You're more than welcome to come with us.
真的  太好了012---Really? That would be great.
我必须有备而去012---I mean, I have to do something.
她总是取笑我的衣着012---She kind of teased me about how I dress.
能看出来  就你那衬衣012---I can see why. Nice shirt.
你和我穿得一样啊012---You're wearing the same shirt.
白痴"盖璞"  什么人都穿012---Stupid Gap on every corner!
请随便坐012---Make yourselves comfortable,
我带艾瑞卡过来012---and I'll be back with Erica.
好  谢啦012---Okay, thank you.
总算到了012---Well, this is it.
你状态如何012---Are you okay?
很好  对话会有点奇怪012---Yeah, it's just weird, you know?
"我叫钱德勒012---It's like, "Hi, I'm Chandler.
你体内的小人  可以给我养吗"012---May I have the human growing inside you?"
你会表现出色的012---You're gonna be great.
你也是012---You're gonna be great.
那显然012---Well, obviously.
莫妮卡  钱德勒012---Monica? Chandler?
这位是艾瑞卡012---I'd like you to meet Erica.
嗨012---Hi.
真高兴跟你见面012---Hi. It is so, so nice to meet you.
-嗨   -谢谢你同意见我们012---- Hi. - Thank you for agreeing to see us.
-嗨   -你们熟悉一下012---- Hi.  - I'll let you get acquainted.
好的012---Okay.
你们是莫妮卡  钱德勒012---So it's Monica and Chandler?
你们的档案代号是"CRW33815-d号"012---I only know you as "File CRW33815-D."
朋友们就这么叫我们012---That's what our friends call us.
天啊  你们这一对太令人羡慕了012---Gosh, you know, you're just such an amazing couple. It's...
都让人有点敬畏012---...kind of intimidating.
你过奖了012---I don't know about that.
你在开玩笑吗012---Are you kidding me?
我是说  您是医生就够好了012---I mean, it's enough that you're a doctor.
您竟然还娶了个牧师012---But on top of it, you're married to a reverend?
这不是我们...012---I don't think that's exactly--
让她说完  医生012---Let her finish, doctor.
-嗨   -嗨012---- Hey.  - Hey.
莎拉昨晚跟你一起很愉快012---My friend Sarah had a great time last night.
是吗012---Yeah.
是啊  这次你会再约她吗012---Yeah, so you gonna call this one back?
绝不012---No.
你说什么呢  莎拉很棒012---What are you talking about? Sarah's great.
是吗  你知道你的很棒的朋友012---Oh, really? You want to know
干了什么好事012---what your "great" friend did?
我们出去吃饭012---We're out to dinner, okay?
相处融洽012---We were getting along,
聊得开心012---having a really nice time.
我也觉得她很酷012---I was thinking she was really cool.
然后  突然间...012---And then, out of nowhere...
就这样012---That's it?
这就是你不想再跟她约会的理由012---That's why you won't go out with her again?
不就吃了你的薯条吗  有什么大不了012---So she took some fries. Big deal.
我不是气她吃我几根薯条012---Hey, look, it's not about a few fries.
你得清楚薯条的象征意义012---It's about what the fries represent.
-啥  -所有食物012---- What?  - All food!
对不起012---Well, I'm sorry.
竟然介绍你012---I can't believe I set you up
和这么个"怪物"约会012---with such a monster!
我带女孩吃饭012---Hey, look, I take a girl out...
她点什么都可以012---...she can order whatever she wants.
越多越好012---The more the better, all right?
但不可以自己012---Just don't order
只点沙拉却夺我的食物012---a garden salad and then eat my food!
这么做有可能被切手指的012---That's a good way to lose some fingers.
谢天谢地你来了  你来评评理012---Thank God you're here. Listen to this.
怎么了012---What?
乔伊昨晚约我朋友012---Joey and my friend are out last night,
在吃晚饭的时候012---having dinner, and she reaches over...
-她伸手拿他的薯条  -哦  不012---- ...and takes a few of his fries--  - Oh, no!
这有什么012---What?
你知道这条规则012---You know about the plate thing?
是是  乔伊从不分享食物012---Oh, yeah, yeah. No, Joey doesn't share food.
上星期我们一起吃早餐012---I mean, just last week we were having breakfast...
他盘里有些葡萄012---...and he had a couple grapes on his plate.
你不让她吃葡萄012---You wouldn't let her have a grape?
不  不是我012---No, not me.
是艾玛012---Emma.
乔伊从不分享食物012---Joey doesn't share food!
我还是坚持认为就因为这件破事012---Well, I still think that is a stupid reason
放弃她很不明智012---not to call someone again.
你再约她  好吧012---You are calling her, okay?
如果有必要012---And if you need to,
干脆再点一盘薯条不就完了012---then just get an extra plate of fries for the table.
这主意不错012---I like that.
共享缓冲区012---A sharing buffer. Yeah.
多点一盘薯条012---Yeah, I'll order some extra fries.
再点一盘洋葱012---Maybe a plate of onion rings.
好  好012---Yeah. Yeah.
还要鸡尾虾012---And a shrimp cocktail.
再要些辣鸡翅012---And some Buffalo wings.
或许  一个披萨012---Maybe.... Maybe an individual pizza, huh?
和炸干酪牛肉棒012---And some mozzarella sticks.
我们在谈什么012---What were we talking about?
这地方太好了012---Wow, this place is awesome.
我们还是走吧012---We should just go.
我在这淘不到什么的012---I'm not gonna find anything here.
这的东西都太可笑了012---This stuff is ridiculous.
这地方简直太赞了012---Oh, this place is great!
瑞秋  我才不会穿这个012---Rach, come on, I'm not gonna wear any of this.
我才不穿银色的012---Nothing silver.
-为什么   -有毛毛的012---- Why?  - Okay, nothing with hair.
更不穿带挂锁的012---And nothing with padlocks on it!
罗斯  看看012---Ross, look. Look,
我知道肯定能挑出几件的012---I know that some of this stuff is out there.
但你看这  看看这个012---But I mean, come on, look at this.
看看这件毛衣012---Look at this sweater.
你看多好看012---I mean, this is just beautiful.
是很柔软012---Wow, this is really soft.
350元012---350 dollars?
从700块打折下来012---Down from 700.
你差不多省了200块呢012---You're saving, like, 200 bucks.
今天逻辑学和数学012---Both logic and math
都饱受摧残012---are taking a serious hit today.
这件好  很衬你012---Hey, check this out. It's totally you.
哇哦  这件看起来不错012---Wow. Actually, this looks pretty good.
是啊012---Yeah.
《男孩就是男孩》012---"Boys will be boys"?
-本来就是   -好好012---- What? They will be!  - All right.
算了  我走012---That's it, I'm getting out of here.
别  罗斯  等等嘛012---No, Ross, wait, come on.
还有其他的呢012---There's other stuff here.
衬衣和裤子都不错012---There's some nice shirts, these nice pants.
其实  这些看起来挺适合我012---Actually, these might look pretty good on me.
嗯  是的  你知道你应该干嘛么012---Yes, they will. You know what you should do?
你随便转转先012---Go take a walk.
我知道你尺码,012---All right? I know your size,
我帮你挑些上等货色012---and I'll pick out some really good stuff for you.
-当真   -对012---- Really?  - Yes.
我知道男人穿什么最性感012---I know what looks sexy on guys.
穿我推荐的衣服012---Just wear what I suggest,
不迷死她才怪012---and she is gonna go nuts for you.
你是说...012---So you're saying...
我若穿这条裤子012---...if I wear these pants,
她会允许我侵犯012---I might be getting into hers?
为什么男人老跟我来这套012---Why do men keep talking to me like this?
我是医生012---So the fact that I'm a doctor
我太太是牧师012---and my wife's a reverend...
这对你很重要012---...that's important to you?
是啊  很多申请人都很优秀012---Yeah. I read some great applications...
但是我想012---...but I thought,
带孩子谁能比得上牧师012---"Who better than a minister to raise a child?"
阿门012---Amen.
另外  我觉得把孩子交给个医生是很好的012---Plus, I thought the baby would be in good hands with a doctor.
很好的一双手012---Good hands.
疗伤圣手012---Healing hands.
牧师  我能问一下012---Reverend, can I ask?
圣经上对领养孩子怎么说吗012---Does the Bible say anything about adoption?
但做无妨012---It says, "Do it."
她让他们领养了一个婴孩（模仿圣经句式  原为"你要怀孕生子  可以给他起名叫耶稣"）012---"And behold, she did adopt unto them a baby.
此乃善举012---And it was good."
-哇  -是啊  我也哇012---- Wow.  - Yeah, wow.
我在想  你们工作都责任重大012---I was wondering-- You both have such serious jobs.
你有时间兼顾孩子和你的教友吗012---Would you have time to take care of a baby and your flock?
我的教友  我的教友们没事儿012---Oh, no, my flock? My flock is good.
这个时候  我的教友都是自己照顾自己012---Yeah. My flock pretty much takes care of themselves by this point.
好教友  教友...012---Good flock. Flock...
当医生很花时间吧012---But being a doctor, that must take up a lot of time.
我的情况不同012---Not for me it doesn't.
谈得如何012---So how's everything going in here?
太棒了012---We're great.
我想问题我都问完了012---I think I may have asked all my questions.
很好  你们有什么要问她012---Good. Do you have questions for Erica?
我想问问012---Yeah, actually.
你读到满意的申请表012---So you read a file that you liked...
然后告诉代理人编号012---...and then you gave the agency the serial number
然后他们联系到我们012---and they contacted us?
我们的系统中用户完全匿名012---Yes. Our system ensures total anonymity.
我们以此为荣012---We're very proud of it.
应该骄傲012---You should be.
真的是一流012---You're really on top of stuff.
别的没什么了012---Well then, if there's nothing else,
那我们俩谈谈012---then the two of us should talk.
实际上…012---I actually....
-我想我们不必谈了 -为什么不012---- I don't think we have to. - We don't?
我看了你们的档案012---Yeah, when I read about you two,
就确定要选你们012---I was pretty sure I wanted you...
但还想当面见见你们012---...but I just thought we should meet face to face.
我决定了012---I've made my decision.
就选他们012---I choose them.
哦  天啊  太棒了012---Oh, my God, this is great.
太棒了  听见吗012---This is so great. Did you hear that?
是的  听见了012---Yeah, I did.
嘿012---Hey.
谢谢  太谢谢了012---Thank you. Thank you so much.
你将来一定进天堂012---You are so going to heaven!
我们买了些很棒的东西012---We got some really great stuff.
对012---Yeah.
但是  有些胸罩似乎不妥012---Yeah, but I'm not sure about some of the bras I got.
真的  你能穿上试给我看吗012---Really? Do you want to try some of them on for me?
好012---Okay.
等一下  我们是在乔伊的幻想里吗012---Wait, are we in Joey's imagination?
糟糕  错拿罗斯一袋012---Oh, no. I took one of Ross' bags by mistake.
我那件不见了012---And one of mine is missing.
肯定在罗斯那里012---Ross probably has it.
找他拿回来好了012---You'll get it from him later.
你觉得如何012---So, what do you think?
这下我们再也撞不了衫了012---I think we're not wearing the same shirt anymore.
对  瑞秋帮我选的012---Yeah. Yeah, Rachel picked it out for me.
她让我相信她012---She told me to trust her, and you know what?
真高兴我答应了012---I'm glad I did.
一路过来回头率暴高012---I turned quite a few heads on my way over here.
老兄  别穿成这样012---Dude, I really don't think you should be wearing that.
我明白012---I see.
有人怕我抢走了女人的目光012---Somebody's afraid of a little competition with the ladies?
看起来好用某人就是个女人了012---Looks like someone is the ladies!
你嫉妒  因为你不能把这件扒下来012---You're just jealous because you couldn't pull this off.
现在失陪了  我约会去012---Yeah. Now if you'll excuse me, I have a date.
看到没  大家都只看我012---See? All eyes on me!
不能签012---We are not signing those papers.
为啥012---Why not?
这样做不对  他们搞错了012---It's wrong. They made a mistake.
当我们是别人012---They think we're somebody else.
上帝的安排  凡人懂什么012---God works in mysterious ways.
别再冒充了012---You have got to stop.
但她喜欢我们012---But she liked us.
她喜欢的是钱德勒医生012---She likes Doctor Chandler
和莫妮卡牧师012---and Reverend Monica.
如果你想一下012---If you think about it,
我其实满像牧师012---I'm kind of like a reverend.
作为主厨  我给饥饿的人和穷人提供食物012---I mean, as a chef, I serve God
这不也是为上帝服务012---by feeding the hungry and poor.
你们一份小牛排卖34块9毛5012---Your veal chop is 34.95!
得了012---Come on,
幸福来敲门了012---I just-- I think we've been given an opportunity.
不如将错就错012---The mistake's already made.
他们已经在写书面报告了012---They're writing up the papers now.
但我们不是她要选的人012---But we're not the ones she chose.
你竟然理直气壮012---How can you feel okay about this?
因为…012---Because.
虽然我们不是她选中的人012---We may not be who she thinks we are...
但没人会比我们更爱那个小娃娃012---...but no one will ever love that baby more than us.
-我明白  -我的意思是012---- I know.  - I mean, who knows...
谁知道我们到底还要等多久012---...how long it's gonna take for someone else
才会有人再选我们012---to give us a baby?
万一永远没人选我们012---What if no one ever picks us?
哦  亲爱的012---Oh, honey....
求你了012---Please?
求你了  我们就快要成功了012---Please. We are so close.
莫妮卡  我也想要孩子012---Monica, I want a baby too.
但她要送出他的心肝宝贝012---But this woman is giving away her child.
她应该知道对方的真实身份012---She deserves to know who it's going to.
好吧  你说的没错012---Okay. You're right.
我们告诉她真相012---So we'll tell the truth.
但是谁知道呢012---And who knows, you know?
没准她会因为我们告诉她真相而喜欢我们012---Maybe she'll like us for us.
或许她会012---Maybe she will.
我怎么就不是牧师呢012---Why couldn't I have been a reverend?
你是犹太教的012---You're Jewish.
差别不大012---Technicality!
女士点的田园沙拉012---Garden salad for the lady.
看来很诱人  真会点012---Oh, that looks great. Good ordering.
男士点的海鲜拼盘012---Seafood platter for the gentleman,
另有一盘薯条012---and extra fries.
请慢用012---Enjoy.
薯条很美味012---Those fries look delicious.
你也喜欢吃法国薯条012---I didn't know you liked French fries.
吃吧  我的就是你的012---Help yourself. What's mine is yours.
好大的蒸粉蚌012---Wow, are those stuffed clams?
对  是我的蒸粉蚌012---Yes, they are my stuffed clams.
