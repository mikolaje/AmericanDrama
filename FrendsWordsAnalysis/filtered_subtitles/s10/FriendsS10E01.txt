然后她告诉我012---Then she told me
她和乔伊已经分手了012---that she and Joey had broken up
某程度上是因为她喜欢我012---and part of the reason was she had feelings for me.
是吧  好012---Right. Yeah.
你知道我碰到查莉的那天012---You know I've wanted to ask Charlie out

总之  事情一件接一件012---Anyway, one thing led to another, and...
还没反应过来  我们已经在接吻了012---...before you know it, we were kissing.
你觉得乔伊会多生气012---How angry do you think Joey's gonna be?
这很难说  罗斯012---That is hard to say, Ross.
这很难说012---That is hard to say.
我要去找他了012---I gotta find him.
他一定就在这什么地方012---He's gotta be here someplace.
就是啊012---You would think.

我们吻了十分钟012---We kissed for 10 minutes...
然后和朋友说这件事012---...and now we're talking to our friends about it,
只有六年级学生才这样012---so I guess this is sixth grade.
不  你们想过这会使012---No, no. Have you thought about
事情变得多复杂吗012---how complicated this could get?
罗斯怎么办012---What about Ross?
可他现在跟查莉在一起012---Look, he's with Charlie now.
对  可他想在正式开始之前012---Yeah, but he wants to talk to you
先和你说一下012---before anything really happens with her.
作为朋友012---And as his friend,
你们不觉得012---I mean, don't you think
你们也应该这么做吗012---he deserves the same from you?
你太讨厌了  姓盖勒的012---You're a pain in my ass, Geller.
好吧  各位012---All right, you guys.
很感谢你们的意见012---Look, we appreciate all the advice...

在乎你的朋友做件事吗012---the people that care about you?
-当然  -去说清楚012---- Sure.  - Enunciate.
出去012---Get out!
他们说得对吗012---Are they right?

我是说012---I mean, you know....

好吧  乔伊012---Fine. Yon know what Joey. Forget it.
回纽约以后  我跟他说012---When we go back to New York, I will tell him.
谢谢  真的  我跟感激012---Thank you. Yeah, I appreciate that.
-你好  迈克家  -我是迈克012---- Hi, Mike's place.  - Hey, it's Mike.
-真快  -不是  她还没来012---- That was fast.  - Oh, no, she's not here yet.
我想我应该离开012---You know, I'm just gonna take off
然后在电话上跟她说分手就好012---and break up with her over the phone.
你不能这样012---You can't do that. Oh, come on,
这样太怂了  迈克012---Mike, strap on a pair.
怎么不直接告诉她我们又复合了012---Why don't you tell her that we got back together.
女人欣赏诚实012---You know, women appreciate honesty.
偶尔也喜欢012---We also appreciate gentle spanking
被轻柔地打屁股012---once in a while, just FYl.
还有一件事012---One more thing.
在我的咖啡台上有张宝宝的照片012---There might be a picture of Precious on my coffee table.
她叫宝宝012---Her name's Precious?
她是纯种的吗012---Is she a pure breed,
还是你在动物收容所捡来的012---or did you pick her up at the pound?
总之  我只想提醒你一下012---Any way, I just want to give you a heads up.
好  如果她不高兴了012---Okay. And if she gets upset.
记得挠挠她的肚子012---...just scratch her tummy
逗她高兴012---and give her a liver snap.
嗨  我是宝宝  你是谁012---Hi. I'm Precious. Who are you?
-我是菲比  -菲比012---- I'm Phoebe.  - Phoebe?
迈克的前女友菲比012---Mike's ex-girlfriend, Phoebe?
他的一生挚爱  那个菲比012---The love of his life? That Phoebe?
我真想让同事们快点看看这个012---Oh, I can't wait for everyone at work to see these!
明天晚上你才回去工作  是吗012---You go back to work tomorrow night?
对012---Yeah.
那么如果你想让他们看012---So if you want people to see them...
也就是说你破晓前不会把他们解下啦012---...you're not having them taken out, say, at the break of dawn?
如果我解下来了012---Well, if I had them taken out,
我就不能这么做了012---then I wouldn't be able to do this.
你很喜欢  对吧012---You like that, right?
你唱什么呢012---What are you singing?
《十全十美》里的波利乐舞曲012---It's "Bolero" from 10.
那是《现代启示录》里的《狂热的瓦格纳》012---It's "Ride of the Valkyries" from Apocalypse Now.
是这样  梳辫子是012---Here's the thing. The cornrows were
用来解决你头发的卷曲问题的012---a solution to your frizzy-hair problem.
现在到家了012---Now that we're home,
没有那样的困扰了012---you don't have that problem.
所以如果你考虑一下...012---If you think about it...
我讨厌他们012---I hate them.
什么  你说过你喜欢的012---What? You said you liked them.
我说过吗  我们回想一下012---Did l? Let's refresh.
我想我的原话是012---I believe what I said was
"我可以看见你的头皮"012---that I could see your scalp.
好吧  虽然你不喜欢012---Well, fine. So you don't like them.
可其他人都喜欢012---Everybody else does.
再一次  让我们回到那次旅游012---Again, let's journey back.
我记得瑞秋说的是012---As I recall, Rachel said
她以前从没注意过你的头骨的形状012---she had never noticed the shape of your skull before.
还有乔伊...012---And Joey?
乔伊当时看不出你有什么不一样012---Well, Joey didn't realize there was anything different.
我不管  我喜欢这样012---You know what? I don't care.
喜欢它  而且我要留着它012---I like it like this, and I'm gonna keep it.
你嫉妒是012---You're just jealous
因为你的头发不能这么做012---because your hair can't do this.
-敲在你的牙上了  -还有眼睛012---- Get yourself in the tooth? - And the eye.
她来了  艾玛012---Hi! There she is! Hi, Emma.
天呐  我想死你了012---Oh, my God, I missed you.
艾玛  我真是太想你了012---Oh, Emma, I missed you so much. Hi.
你和外婆过得开心吗  呃012---Did you have a good time with Grandma Green? Huh?
她喋喋不休的时候012---Did she give you a bottle of antidepressants again
给你抗抑郁药了吗012---to use as a rattle?
只有一次  罗斯012---That was one time, Ross,
而且只有5毫克012---and they were only, like, five milligrams.
艾玛  爸爸有礼物带给你  知道吗012---Hey, Emma, Daddy has some presents for you, okay?
我想让你在这儿等一会儿012---I want you to wait right here.
在这  宝贝儿012---Come here, sweetie.
罗斯  我有点儿事012---Ross, actually, there's something that
要跟你说012---I really need to talk to you about.
好的  说吧012---Okay, shoot.
-好吧  好的  事情是这样的  -哦不012---- Okay. All right, here's the deal.  - Oh, no!
怎么了012---What is it?
大瓶的洗发液破了012---Oh, major shampoo explosion!
听着罗斯  这很难开口012---Look, Ross, this really isn't easy.
还沾得到处都是012---Oh, it's all over everything!
为什么  为什么偏偏是我012---Why? Why me?
因为你拿了300瓶洗发液012---Because you took 300 bottles of shampoo?
对不起  对不起  你刚才说什么012---I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You were saying?
好吧...  是关于我和...012---Well, yeah. Look, it's about me and--
噢  不要  又一瓶012---Oh, not another one!
天呐  是摩丝012---Oh, my--Oh, and this is moisturizer!
这个更难清理012---It's even harder to clean!
为什么012---Why?
为什么坏事总是落到好人的头上012---Why do bad things happen to good people?
好吧  很显然我来得不是时候012---Wow. Clearly this is not a good time.
你觉得呢012---You think?
好的  再见012---Okay. Bye.
好了  迈克已经回来了012---All right, so Mike's on his way over.
你以为你们在这儿见012---You thought you were meeting here,
他却以为在餐馆见面012---he thought at the restaurant, so....
谁对谁错不重要012---It doesn't matter who's right or wrong.
重要的是我要走了012---The point is, I'm gonna take off.
你告诉我到底发生了什么之前012---Wait. I'm not letting you leave
我不会让你走的012---until you tell me what's going on here.
我是说012---I mean...
你们和好了还是怎么的012---...are you guys getting back together or something?
好吧012---All right.
苏茜  我能叫你苏茜吗012---Susie-- Can I call you Susie?
我叫宝宝012---My name is Precious.
我可叫不出口012---I can't say that.
苏茜  跟你直说了吧012---Susie, I'm gonna be straight with you.
迈克跟我确实和好了012---Mike and I are back together.
并且不幸的是012---And unfortunately...
这样就要终结你们的关系012---...that effectively ends your relationship with him.
并且他对此感到很抱歉012---He's very sorry about that,
并祝你好运012---and wishes you the best luck in all your endeavors.
我无法相信  为什么012---I just can't believe this. Why?
这个我也不知...012---Well, I don't--
他为什么这么做012---Why would he do this?
我做错什么了012---What's wrong with me?
没有  你什么也没做错012---There's nothing wrong with you.
那我现在到底该怎么办012---What the hell am I supposed to do now?
可恶  女人  振作起来012---Damn it, woman! Pull yourself together!
看在上帝的份上  保持你的尊严012---Have some pride, for the love of God!
好吧  你好象不喜欢苦涩的爱情012---Okay, not a fan of the tough love.
我真不敢相信012---I just can't believe
迈克竟然没有给我一点暗示012---that Mike didn't give me any warning.
他之前也不知道012---He didn't know.
他也不是计划来巴巴多斯012---He wasn't planning on coming to Barbados
向我求婚的012---and proposing to me.
他向你求婚了012---He proposed to you?
这真是史上最糟糕的生日了012---This is the worst birthday ever!
听着  宝宝...012---Look, Precious...
你不值得为迈克伤心012---Mike's not worth this.
你是个迷人聪明的女孩012---You're an attractive intelligent woman...
面对现实吧  迈克太不是东西了012---...and let's face it, Mike's kind of a wang.
他向我求婚的同时还跟你在一起012---He proposed to me while he was still seeing you.
他居然想在你生日的时候跟你分手012---He was gonna break up with you on your birthday?
我本来也不想炫耀012---I don't like to kiss and tell,
不过这个周末他对你不忠的太多了012---but he cheated on you a lot this weekend.
天呐  可能你说对了012---Oh, my God, you know, maybe you're right.
可能我并不需要他012---Maybe I don't need him.
我应该受到尊重012---I deserve to be treated with respect.
去你的  迈克012---Screw you, Mike.
你这个胆怯的杂种012---You're a coward and a bastard,
我希望你烂死在地狱里012---and I hope you rot in hell!
不用谢我012---You're welcome.
亲爱的  你在里面好久了012---Honey? You've been in there for a long time.
没事吧012---Is everything okay?
不012---Not really.
我有点问题012---I have a problem.
是吗  怎么了012---Really? What happened?
好吧  我唱着《女人不哭》跳舞...012---Well, I was dancing around and singing "No Woman, No Cry" ...
然后就挂住了012---...and I got stuck.
一点都动不了了012---You can't move at all?
噢  我可以动...012---Oh, I can move.
如果我解开你012---If I untangle you,
你会解开这个稻穗头012---will you please get rid of the cornrows?
好吧012---I guess so.
有些看起来有磨痕了012---Some of these look a little frayed.
对  我本来想咬开的012---Yeah, I tried to gnaw myself free.
-嗨  -嗨012---- Hey. - Hi.
-怎么样  你跟罗斯说了吗  -没有  我想说012---- So? Did you tell Ross?  - Well, I tried...
但他的洗发液出事故了012---...but then he had a shampoo-related emergency.
-所以我想该轮到你去了  -不...012---- So I guess now it's your turn again.  - No...
最好是你去告诉他012---I think it's better if you tell him.
女人来说容易些012---You know, it's easier for a woman.
你知道  如果他抓狂了  你就可以012---That way, you know, if he gets mad, all you have to do is go
我不是有意的012---I didn't mean it.
我太抱歉了012---I'm so sorry
对  女人是这样啊012---Yeah, 'cause that's what we do.
好吧...这样怎么样  明天...012---Alright, alright, okay, uhm... How about this? Tomorrow...
明天我们一起去012---Tomorrow we'll both go
一起告诉他012---and we'll tell him together.
好吧  听起来公平些012---Okay, that sounds fair.
可这样我们又不能...012---That just means, once again, we can't--
我知道...012---I know...
不过没问题012---That's okay.
我们有自制力012---I mean, we can control ourselves.
我们不是动物啊012---We're not animals.
-当然  我们可以等  -是啊012---- No! Of course, we can wait.  - Yeah.
那么我想该说晚安了012---All right, so I guess that means good night then.
好的  晚安012---Yep. Good night.
晚...安012---Good night.
晚安012---Good night.
说真的  晚安012---Seriously, good night.
别说晚安了012---Stop saying good night.
真对不起啊...012---I'm so sorry.
看我在抽屉里找到了什么012---Look what I found in the drawer.
你还说我永远不会戴它呢012---And you said I'd never wear this.
我把你解救下来012---Now that I untangled you,
你还没报答我呢012---how about you do a little something for me?
当然  你想让我怎么报答012---Sure. What did you have in mind?
你应该知道的啊012---I think you know.
真的  但我有点不想啊012---Really? I don't-- I don't really feel like it.
我就是想要012---This is what I want to do.
好吧012---Okay.
我不知道你为什么这么喜欢它012---I just don't get why you like it so much.
她是个联调局特工012---She's a FBI agent,
伪装去选美012---posing as a beauty contestant.
