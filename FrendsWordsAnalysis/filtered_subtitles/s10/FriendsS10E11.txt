找到第一个名字就打了过去012---...and got the first name we could find.
你们的电话簿有多老了012---How old's your phone book?
我的天啊012---Oh, my God,

我可不需要这些012---Look, I don't need this.
我要走了  我的帽子呢012---I'm out of here. Where's my hat?

哦  是  我保守012---Okay, I'm uptight.
所以我不想看个半大老头儿012---That's why I don't wanna watch a middle-aged guy...
穿一身我只能认为是012---...dance around in what I can only assume
小孩万圣节的行头跳脱衣舞012---is a child's Halloween costume.
我也许是从我侄子那儿借的衣服012---I may have borrowed this from my nephew...

我以为我们之间友谊的基础是难堪的发型012---I believe the foundation of our friendship was unfortunate hair.
好吧  你看012---All right, look.
要是我们真的明算账的话012---If we're really gonna do this,
