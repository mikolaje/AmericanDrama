对，冷静下来012---Yeah, calm down.
每次他们来这里，你不会看到罗斯 神经兮兮的，非常可怕012---You don't see Ross getting all chaotic and twirly every time they come.

贝瑞，记得我吗？ 我是在你家人面前012---"Hi, Barry, remember me? I'm the girl...
伤了你心的女孩012---...that stomped on your heart in front of your entire family"
天啊，现在我得归还戒指 戒指却不见了012---Oh, God. Now I'm gonna have to return the ring, without the ring...
那让情况变得更复杂012---...which makes it so much harder.
别紧张，瑞秋 我们会找到它的，对吧？012---Easy, Rach, we'll find it. Won't we?
- 对 - 好吧，听着012---- Oh, yeah. MONICA: Okay, look.
你最后一次戴上它 是什么时候的事？012---When did you have it on last?
或许就在她把它弄丢之前012---Doy. Probably right before she lost it.
