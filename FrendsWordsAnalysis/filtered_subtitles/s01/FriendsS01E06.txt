不好意思…012---Excuse me...

我不敢相信我已经来七秒钟了 却没有人问我约会的情况012---I've been here seven seconds, and you haven't asked me how my date went.

我整晚都在讲我的事 真的很抱歉012---I've been talking about myself all night long. I'm sorry.
那你呢？ 告诉我你的故事012---What about you? Tell me your stories.

那时很晚了…012---And it was at night...
我一直坐到布鲁克林站…012---...and I rode it all the way to Brooklyn...
只为了好玩012---...just for the hell of it.
我们聊到两点 实在是完美的夜晚012---We talked till 2. It was this perfect evening.
多多少少啦012---More or less.
突然间 我们发现自己身处也门012---Suddenly, we realized we were in Yemen.
抱歉，谁是我们…？012---I'm sorry, so "we" is?
就是我和瑞克012---"We" is me and Rick.
- 谁是瑞克？ - 谁是瑞克？012---- Who's Rick? - Who's Rick?
我先生012---My husband.
哦012---ALL: Ooh.
- 噢，所以你离婚了？ - 没有012---- Oh, so you're divorced? - No.
抱歉，所以你在守寡吗？ 希望如此012---I'm sorry. So you're widowed? Hopefully?
不，我还是有夫之妇012---No, I'm still married.
那你先生对于你在这里 有什么想法？012---So how would your husband feel about you sitting here with me...
还把脚滑到我的脚上面…012---...sliding your foot so far up my leg...
连口袋里有多少零钱 都数得出来012---...you can count the change in my pocket?
别担心012---Don't worry.
我想说他应该不会介意 因为他也没有太介意伊森012---I imagine he'd be okay with you because he's okay with Ethan.
伊森？谁是伊森？012---Ethan? There's an Ethan?
伊森是我的…012---Ethan is my...
男朋友012---...boyfriend.
什么？!012---ALL: What?
跟我解释一下 竟然你已经有丈夫跟男友了012---So, uh, what kind of relationship do you imagine us having...
你希望我们会有什么样的关系？012---...if you already have a husband and a boyfriend?
我想主要是性关系吧012---I suppose, mainly sexual.
呵012---Huh.
很遗憾没有成功012---I'm sorry it didn't work out.
什么没有成功？ 我星期四还会再跟她见面012---What not work out? I'm seeing her again on Thursday.
你没有听到自己说的故事吗？012---Didn't you listen to the story?
太诡异了，你怎么可以 跟这样的女人交往？012---How could you get involved with a woman like this?
我一开始也很难接受 但是想想其实百益无一害012---I had trouble with it at first, but I get all the good stuff.
只要谈天说笑 还有性…012---All the fun, all the talking, all the sex...
完全不用负责任012---...and no responsibility.
这可是每个男人的梦想012---This is every guy's fantasy!
才不是，罗斯 这是你的梦想吗？012---That is not true. Ross, is this your fantasy?
当然不是012---No, of course not.
是，没错012---Yeah. Yeah, it is.
所以你们不介意 跟有其他伴侣的女性交往？012---You'd go out with someone else who's going out with someone else?
我做不到012---I couldn't.
很好012---Good for you.
我和女性交往时 我必须知道…012---When I'm with a woman, I need to know...
我交往的人 比她还多012---...that I'm going out with more people than she is.
一夫一妻012---You know...
确实值得商榷012---...monogamy can be a tricky concept.
就人类学上的角度来说…012---I mean, anthropologically...
好吧，你们永远 都不会知道了012---Fine. Now you'll never know.
我们只是开玩笑啦 说吧012---We're kidding. Tell us.
- 我们都想知道 - 说啦012---MONICA: We wanna know. JOEY: Come on!
好吧，理查李基 有一个理论…012---All right. There's a theory put forth by Richard Leakey...
塔-哒012---Ta-da!
我们以后都要用这样的方式 打招呼吗？我还挺喜欢的012---Are we greeting each other this way now? I like that.
你们看，我打扫了012---Look! I cleaned!
我擦了窗户 地板012---I did the windows. I did the floors.
我还用了吸尘器所有的接头 除了圆的那一个012---I used all the attachments on the vacuum except for that round one.
我不知道那是用来做什么的012---I don't know what it's for.
没有人知道 我们也不该问012---Nobody knows, and we're not supposed to ask.
你们觉得怎么样？012---RACHEL: What do you think?
- 很干净 - 真的，很棒012---CHANDLER: It's very clean. MONICA: Really, it looks great!
我看到你移动了绿色的垫椅012---Oh. Heh. I see you moved the green ottoman.
啊哦012---ROSS & PHOEBE: Uh-oh.
是怎么发生的？012---How did that happen?
不知道啊 我觉得放那边比较好看012---I don't know. I thought it looked better there.
而且茶几旁边 也多一个座位012---And also, it's an extra seat around the coffee table.
对，是蛮有趣的012---Yeah, it's interesting.
这样好了，只是好玩…012---But you know what? Just for fun...
看看放在原本的位置会如何012---...let's see what it looked like in the old spot.
只是比较一下012---Just to compare.
看一下012---Let's see. Ha!
嗯，放在这里 也很棒012---Well, it looks good there too.
先摆在这里吧012---Let's leave it there for a while.
真不敢相信你试着 搬动那个绿色的垫椅012---I can't believe you tried to move the green ottoman.
幸好你没摊开杂志012---Thank God you didn't fan out the magazines.
不然她会把你的眼睛挖出来012---She'll scratch your eyes out.
我没有那么糟糕吧？012---You guys, I am not that bad!
你有，摩妮卡012---Yeah, you are.
还记得我跟你 住在一起过吗012---Remember, I lived with you?
你就是一副…012---You were a little, you know...
这样说超不公平的012---That is so unfair!
拜托，我们小时候 你的破娃娃是唯一不破的012---When we were kids, yours was the only Raggedy Ann doll that wasn't raggedy.
好吧，我比较有责任心 有组织性012---Okay, so I'm responsible. I'm organized.
但我也能很懒散012---But, hey, I can be a kook!
好吧，懒女人012---All right, you madcap gal!
想像这个情况012---Try to imagine this.
电话帐单寄来了 但是你没有立刻付费012---The phone bill arrives, but you don't pay it right away.
- 为什么没有 - 因为你很懒散012---- Why not? - Because you're a kook!
所以你等到他们 再寄一张通知给你012---Instead, you wait until they send you a notice.
我做得到012---I could do that.
好 你让我去采购…012---Okay, then you let me go grocery shopping...
我买了洗衣精012---...and I buy laundry detergent.
但不是容易挤出来的那种012---But it's not the one with the easy-pour spout.
怎么会有人这么做012---Why would someone do that?
有些人会这样想012---One might wonder.
有人把杯子放在茶几上 没有杯垫012---A glass is on the table. There's no coaster.
是一杯冷饮 在大热天之下012---It's a cold drink. It's a hot day.
小水珠逐渐逼近桌面…012---Beads of condensation are inching their way closer to the wood...
不要说了012---Stop it!
天哪012---Oh, my God!
是真的，我是什么样的人？012---It's true. Who am I?
摩妮卡，你是妈012---Monica, you're Mom.
我的天啊012---JOEY: Uh-huh? Oh, my God!

好吗？他开始冲澡…012---All right? He goes into the shower, and then...
我就演他的屁股012---...I'm his butt.

你们别这样012---Come on, you guys.
这是部艾尔·帕西诺主演 大制作的电影012---This is a real movie, and Al Pacino's in it and that's big!
不，真的太棒了012---Oh, no, it's terrific.
你努力了这么多年…012---After all your years of struggling...
终于有机会 “挤”进娱乐圈了012---...you've finally been able to crack your way into show business.
好吧，你们尽量开玩笑 我才不在乎012---Okay, fine. Make jokes, I don't care.
这是我的一大突破012---This is a big break for me!
你说得没错012---You're right. It is.
那你要请我们去看 屁股首映会吗？012---So are you gonna invite us all to the big opening?

我的眼睛啊…！012---My eyes! My eyes!
我警告过你了012---MONICA: I warned you.
是谁这么吵？012---Who is being loud?
噢，是摩妮卡012---Oh, that would be Monica.
嘿，我可以借点东西吗？ 我想煮早餐给欧若拉吃012---Can I borrow some things? I wanna make Aurora breakfast.
噢，你有整夜的时间能陪她？012---You got the whole night, huh?
对，我只有二十分钟 直到伊森…012---Well, I only have 20 minutes until Ethan, so...
有人有点哀怨喔？012---Do I sense a bit of resentment?
不…没有哀怨 相信我…012---No, no, no. No resentment. Believe me...
真的很值得012---...it's worth it, okay?
在感情关系中 总是有些特别难忘的时刻012---In a relationship, you have these key moments...
让你一辈子都会记得012---...you'll remember for the rest of your life.
跟欧若拉在一起的 每分每秒都像那样012---Well, every single second is like that with Aurora.
而我刚刚浪费了三十五秒的时间 跟你们说话012---And I've just wasted 35 of them talking to you.
摩妮卡，你可以 帮我开门吗？012---So, uh, Monica, can you help me with the door?
钱德，以前的摩妮卡 会提醒你…012---Um, Chandler, you know, the old Monica would remind you...
用塑胶刷 刷洗锅子012---...to scrub that Teflon pan with a plastic brush.
但是我不会那么做012---But I'm not gonna do that.
该死，就聘请她012---DIRECTOR: Damn it! Hire the girl.

屁股男，你在干什么？012---Butt guy, what are you doing?
我在冲澡012---I'm showering.
不，你在挤屁股012---No, that was clenching.
我的想法是 这个家伙很难过012---Well, the way I see it, the guy's upset here, you know?
他老婆死了 哥哥又失踪012---His wife's dead, his brother's missing.
他的屁股这时候 应该会很生气012---I think his butt would be angry here.
我认为他的屁股 会想在午餐前拍好012---I think his butt would like to get the shot before lunch.
再来一次 开水012---Once again, rolling. Water working.
开拍012---And action!

我想表现出沉静的绝望012---I was going for quiet desperation.
但如果你想问…012---But if you have to ask...
天啊，我好爱这些手指012---God, I love these fingers.
谢谢012---Thank you.
我其实是指我的手指012---No, actually, I meant my fingers.
看看它们有多开心012---Look at them. Look at how happy they are.
- 天啊，我迟到了 - 不要012---- Oh, my God, I'm late! - Oh, no, no, no.
- 不要走 - 好012---- Don't go, don't go. - Okay, okay.
- 我真的得走 - 她要走了012---- I have to. - Look, she's leaving.
对不起，他会等我012---I'm sorry. He'll be waiting for me.
我以为你跟瑞克谈过了012---I thought you talked to Rick.
不是瑞克012---It's not Rick.
伊森？他可以陪你 - 整天的时问！012---Ethan? He gets the whole day with you!
不，是安德鲁012---No, it's Andrew.
我知道会有好几年的时间…012---I know there'll be many moments...
我将后悔问你以下的问题 但是…012---...when I'll regret asking the following question, but...
安德鲁是谁？012---And Andrew is?
他是…新欢012---He's... new.
你是说瑞克、伊森和我 无法满足你？012---So you're not completely fulfilled by Rick, Ethan and myself?
我并不是…012---No, that's not exactly what I was...
不知道有多少女人…012---Most women would kill...
会被我们三个人迷倒012---...for three guys like us.
那你想要什么？012---So, what do you want?
你012---You.
- 你已经有我了 - 不，只是你012---- You have me. - No, no. Just you.
什么意思？012---What do you mean?
甩掉其他人012---Lose the other guys.
他们所有人吗？012---Like, all of them?
别这样，我们在一起很开心 为什么不行？012---Come on, we're great together. Why not?
我们为什么不能 保持这样就好？012---Why can't we just have what we have now?
只要谈天说笑跟性…012---Why can't we just talk, laugh and make love...
彼此没有任何负担？012---...without feeling obligated to one another?
今晚之前，我以为 这也是你想要的012---Up until tonight, I thought that's what you wanted too.
部分的我想要…012---Well, part of me wants that...
但我就像个双面人012---...but it's like I'm two guys.
其中一个说 〝闭嘴，这样很棒〞012---I mean, one guy's saying, "Shut up! This is great!"
但还有另一个人012---But there's this other guy.
他每次都会挺身而出…012---It's the guy who wells up every time the Grinch's heart...
仗义直言012---...grows three sizes and breaks that measuring device.
他会说〝这太难了 快点脱身〞012---He's saying, you know, "This is too hard. Get out, get out!"
那你会听哪个人的话？012---So which one of the two guys will you listen to?
两个人的话我都听 他们一直插嘴012---I have to listen to both. They don't let each other finish.
哪个人？012---Which one?
第二个012---The second guy.
我懂了012---I see.
如果改变心意 就打给我012---Call me if you change your mind.
抱歉，第一个人主管嘴唇012---Sorry, the first guy runs the lips.
这样想吧，是你甩了她012---Look at it this way. You dumped her!
对吧 这个女生…012---Right? I mean, this woman was...
超级性感…012---...unbelievably sexy...
又美丽 聪明 超难追…012---...and beautiful, intelligent, unattainable...
再说一次你为什么这么做012---Tell me why you did this again?
嘿！嘿！012---ROSS: Hey!  MONICA: Hey!
电影明星来了012---RACHEL: Movie star!
你不是那个在艾尔帕西诺的新片中 饰演屁股的人吗012---Aren't you the guy who plays the butt in the new Al Pacino movie?

大家伙012---Big guy?
我就是突然想这么说嘛012---It felt like a "big guy" moment.
我被炒鱿鱼了012---I got fired!
