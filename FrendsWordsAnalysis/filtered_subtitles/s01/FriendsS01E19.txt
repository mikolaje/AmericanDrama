男人烦死了〞 你的阴茎禁令呢012---I'm done with men"? The whole, uh, penis embargo?
嗯，不确定012---Oh, I don't know.

跟巴瑞在一起，感觉很安全安逸 但是没有火花012---With Barry, it was safe and it was easy, but there was no heat.

我们要去洗澡 对不对  对啊 我们要洗澡哦 好不好012---Yeah, we're gonna go take a bath. Yes, we are, aren't we? Yes, we are.
他们仍然只是朋友吧012---They're still just friends, right?
我们明天见012---And I will see you tomorrow.
没错 明天你要来 瑞秋阿姨这边 对不对012---That's right. You're gonna spend tomorrow at Aunt Rachel's, aren't you?
等一下，等一下 摩妮卡阿姨有没有权利说话？012---Hang on, hang on. Does Aunt Monica get a say in this?
拜托啦  摩妮卡阿姨  好不好012---Please, Aunt Monica, please? Ha, ha.
拜托，放轻松 明天你根本就不在012---Oh, unclench. You're not even gonna be here.
真不敢相信我们居然在讨论这种事012---CHANDLER: I can't believe we're having this discussion.
同意，我也不敢相信012---I agree. I'm, like, in disbelief.
你不觉得你跟瑞秋如果能在一起 早就在一起了012---Don't you think if things were gonna happen with Rachel, they would've happened?
我告诉你们 她说她想要跟…012---I'm telling you, she said she's looking for a relationship...
像我这样的人谈恋爱012---...with someone exactly like me.
她真的这么说012---She really said that?
〝像我这样的人〞是我自己加的012---Well, I added the "exactly like me" part.
但是她说她在找个好男人 好男人今晚就会出现了012---But she said she's looking for someone. And someone is gonna be there tonight.
〝今晚〞 你是说真的012---"Tonight" tonight?
我想这一定会很完美 就只有我们两个012---Well, I think it's perfect. It's just gonna be the two of us.
她整天都在照顾我的猴子012---She spent all day taking care of my monkey.
我不记得上次有女生 照顾我的猴子是什么时候的事了012---I can't remember the last time I got a girl to take care of my monkey.
反正，下班后 我去买一瓶酒…012---Anyway, you know, I figured after work, I'd go pick up a bottle of wine...
然后过去开始追求她012---...go over there and, uh, try to woo her.
你知道你应该怎么做吗012---Hey, you know what you should do?
你应该带她回19世纪末 当时还有人使用那种字眼012---You should take her back to the 1890s when that phrase was last used.
如果你坚持下去…012---If you keep this up...
不到周末，那个浑蛋就玩完了012---...you'll be finished with this sucker by the end of the week.
那个围着羽绒围巾的是 法兰西斯医生012---Now, the one in the feathered boa, that's Dr. Francis.
她以前是个男人012---Now, she used to be a man.
你看，那是瑞文 我们讨厌她012---Oh, look. See, now, there's Raven. We hate her.
很高兴她快死了012---We're glad she's dying.
然后…怎么了 马塞尔012---And then... What? Marcel.
你在玩摩妮卡阿姨的鞋子吗？ 你知道你不可以…012---Are you playing with Monica's shoes? You know you're not supposed to...
哇，哇012---Whoa, whoa.
马塞尔 你大便在鞋子里012---Marcel, did you poo in the shoe?
马塞尔，坏猴子 噢012---Oh, Marcel. Bad monkey.

把他翻过来 快点，把他翻过来012---Roll him over. Oh, come on, roll him over. Oh!
我们知道那不是德柯斯特 对不对，马塞尔？因为…012---Well, we know it wasn't Dexter, right, Marcel? Because...
马塞尔 马塞尔 马…012---Marcel? Marcel? Marc...?
- 你怎么可能把他弄丢了？ - 不知道，我也不知道012---- How could you lose him? - I don't know, I don't know.
我们在看电视 然后他大便在摩妮卡的鞋子里…012---We were watching TV, and then he pooped in Monica's shoe...
等等 他大便在我的鞋子里  哪一只012---Wait. He pooped in my shoe? Which one?
不知道，左脚那一只012---I don't know. The left one.
哪一双012---Which ones?
就是那双你认为百搭的笨重黑鞋012---Oh, those little clunky Amish things you think go with everything.
- 嘿 - 嘿012---- Hey. GROUP: Hey.
为什么空气中充满了负面情绪012---Whoa, oh. Why is the air in here so negative?
- 瑞秋把马塞尔弄丢了 - 噢，不会吧，怎么弄的012---- Rachel lost Marcel. - Oh, no. How?
- 他大便在我的鞋子里  - 那一只012---- He pooped in my shoe. - Which one?
就是我常穿的那双可爱黑鞋012---Those cute little black ones I wear all the time.
不是，是哪一只012---No, which one? Ha, ha.
右脚还是左脚？012---The right or left?
因为左脚的话，代表幸运012---Because the left one is lucky.
大伙儿，拜托 我该怎么办？012---Come on, you guys. What am I gonna do?
好吧，好吧 你是一只猴子…012---All right, all right, all right. You're a monkey...
在城市里走失了012---...you're loose in the city.
你会去哪里？012---Where do you go?
好，这是他第一次出门…012---Okay, it's his first time out...
所以他可能会去 一些观光景点012---...so he's probably gonna want to do some of the touristy things.
我去《猫》音乐剧那边找 你们去俄国茶坊找012---I'll go to Cats. You go to the Russian Tea Room.
天啊！拜托你们012---Oh, my God! Come on, you guys.

先从这栋房子开始 你们去1楼和2楼找012---Start with the building. You take the first and second floor.
菲比跟我去3楼跟4楼012---Phoebe and I will take third and fourth.
哇，那我怎么办？012---Whoa, whoa. What am I gonna do?
好，你留在这里等电话012---Okay, you stay here and just wait by the phone.
在我的鞋子里喷清洁剂 等罗斯回来杀你012---Spray Lysol in my shoe and wait for Ross to kill you.
有人要跟我交换工作吗012---Does anybody want to trade?
你们想干什么012---What do you want?
黑考斯先生，我们朋友的 猴子走丢了，你有没有看到012---Mr. Heckles, our friend lost a monkey. Have you seen it?
我把格子松饼放在外头 是不是你们拿走的012---I left a Belgian waffle out here. Did you take it?
不是012---No.
你为什么要把格子松饼 放在走道里？012---Why would you leave your Belgian waffle in the hall?
我还没准备好要吃012---I wasn't ready for it.
猴子，你有没有看到猴子012---The monkey, have you seen a monkey?
我见过主持人瑞吉斯一次012---I saw Regis Philbin once.
谢谢你，黑考斯先生012---Thank you, Mr. Heckles.
你们欠我一块松饼012---You owe me a waffle.

- 噢，我很想喝 - 好的012---- Oh, I would love some. - Yeah.
这样好了，这样好了 我们不要在这里喝012---But you know what? You know what? Let's not drink it here.
我突然想疯一下 你要不要去纽华克012---I'm feeling kind of crazy. Do you want to go to Newark?
好，好啊012---Uh, okay. Yeah.
我们当然可以去那里 但在去东北部的谋杀案首都前…012---We could do that. But before we head off to the murder capital of the Northeast...
我想先跟你谈一件事012---...I was, uh, kind of wanted to run something by you.
你知道我们先前谈过的…012---You know how we were, you know, talking before...
有关恋爱之类的话题…012---...about relationships and stuff, well...
- 噢，天啊，罗斯，我不能这么做 - 好吧，迅速而痛苦012---- Oh, God, Ross, I cannot do this. - Okay, quick and painful.

你知道，马塞尔吧012---You know Marcel?
- 怎么  - 嗯012---- Yeah? - Well, ahem.
我好像把他弄丢了012---I kind of, uh... I kind of lost him.
我真不敢相信012---I can't believe this.
我只是要你看着他 别让他离开这间公寓012---I mean, all I asked you to do was keep him in the apartment.
我知道，我知道，对不起012---I know, I know. I'm sorry.
你知道吗 我想我也有错012---You know what? I guess it's partially my fault.
我不应该一开始就请你照顾猴子012---I shouldn't have asked you to start off with a monkey.
应该一开始就请你看着 一支铅笔之类的012---I should have started you off with, like, a pen or a pencil.
罗斯，我已经在尽力找了012---Ross, I'm doing everything that I can.
大家都在找他，而且我还…012---I've got everybody looking for him and I got...
- 哪一位  - 动物紧急救援小组012---- Who is it? LUISA [OVER INTERCOM]: Animal Control.
- 你看，我还打电话给动物紧急救援 - 你打电话给动物紧急救援012---- See, I've even got Animal Control. - You called Animal Control?
嗯哼012---Uh-huh.
怎么了 你不喜欢他们吗012---Why? Do you not like them?
马塞尔是非法引进的外来动物012---Heh. Marcel is an illegal exotic animal.
我不能在城市里养012---I'm not allowed to have him in the city.
他们一旦找到他 就会把他从我身边带走012---If they find him, they'll take him away from me.
好吧，这样说好了 你从来没有告诉过我们这件事012---Okay, well, now, see, you never ever, ever told us that.
没错，因为我没想到 你会邀请他们来这里012---That's right, because I didn't expect you we're gonna invite them to the apartment.
你好，谢谢你赶过来012---Hi. Thanks for coming.
是不是有人打电话 问猴子怎么处理012---Somebody called about a monkey?
噢，你知道吗 那完全是个误会012---Oh. Oh, you know what? That was a complete misunderstanding.
对啊，我们以为 我们看到一只猴子，结果不是012---Yeah, we thought we had a monkey, but we didn't.
- 那是顶帽子 - 猫012---- It turned out it was a hat. - Cat.
猫，我刚刚说什么012---Cat. What did I say?
3楼跟4楼 我们都去看过了012---Hi. We checked the third and fourth floor.
- 没有人看到马塞尔 - 马塞尔012---- No one's seen Marcel. - Marcel?
我叔叔马塞尔012---My uncle Marcel.
噢，猴子的名字就是这样来的012---Oh, is that who the monkey's named after?
好吧012---Okay.
你们知道私自豢养 非法引进的外来动物…012---Are you aware that possession of an illegal exotic is punishable...
最高可罚到2年牢狱 动物没收012---...by up to two years in prison and confiscation of the animal.
噢，天啊012---PHOEBE: Oh, my God.
你们会把可怜的小动物 关在牢里2年？012---You'd put that poor little creature in jail?
菲比，记不记得我们说过 说话前要先想一下？012---Pheebs, you remember how we talked about saying things quietly to yourself first?
记得，不过不是随时 都有时间可以这样做012---Yes, but there isn't always time.
我相信一定有更友善的方式解决 你先请坐012---Look, I'm sure there's some friendly way to reconcile this. Um, have a seat.
我们还没自我介绍 我是摩妮卡·盖勒012---First of all, we haven't been introduced. I'm Monica Geller.
噢，天啊，是你012---Oh, my God, you are.
- 而你是瑞秋·葛林 - 对012---- And you're Rachel Green. - Yeah.
露伊莎·基雅内蒂 我也是林肯高中毕业的012---Luisa Gianetti. Lincoln High?
每次在教室上课时 我都坐在你们后面012---I sat behind you guys in homeroom.
露伊莎，噢，我的天啊012---Oh! Luisa. Oh, my God.
摩妮卡，是露伊莎耶！012---Monica. It's Luisa!
同间教室的露伊莎012---Luisa. From homeroom.
太好了！012---Yes!
- 你根本不知道我是谁，对不对  - 不知道012---- You have no idea who I am, do you? RACHEL: No.
完全不知道012---Not at all.
也许是因为整整4年  你正眼都没瞧过我012---Well, maybe that's because you spent four years ignoring me.
说句〝早安，露伊莎〞，还是…012---Would it have been so hard to say, "Morning, Luisa"...
〝好可爱的吊带裤〞 有那么难吗012---...or "Nice overalls"?
噢，真对不起012---Oh, I'm so sorry.
我不怪你，你那时候很胖 问题已经够多了012---It's not so much you. You were fat. You had your own problems.
但是你，真是个讨人厌的女生012---But you. What a bitch.
什么？012---What?
这样好了，过去就算了012---You know what? Be that as it may.
看在过去的份上，猴子的事 能不能请你帮个忙012---You think you could you help us out here on that monkey thing, for old times' sake?
加油，山猫队012---Go, Bobcats.
我可以，但是我不帮012---I could. But I won't.
猴子被我找到，就是我的了012---If I find that monkey, he's mine.
哒 哒 哒012---Da, da, da
很遗憾012---Sorry.
马塞尔？012---CHANDLER: Marcel?
马塞尔？012---JOEY: Marcel?
- 马塞尔？ - 马塞尔？012---- Marcel? - Marcel?
嘿，有什么事我可以帮忙的吗？012---Hi, can I help you?
我们有点紧急状况 我们在找东西012---Uh, we're kind of having an emergency, and, ahem, we were looking for something.
- 找猴子 - 对，你有没有看到一只猴子？012---- A monkey. - Yes, have you seen any?
没有，我没看到什么猴子012---No. No, I haven't seen a monkey.
你们会不会修理暖气炉？012---Do you know anything about fixing radiators?
当然，你们有没有试着 把开关往相反方向转？012---Sure, sure. Did you try turning the knob back the other way?
- 当然有 - 那我们就没办法了012---- Of course. - Oh. Then, no.
你尝尝这鸡尾酒 莱姆酒会不会放太多？012---Taste this daiquiri. Is there too much rum in here?
等一下，希望你们快点找到猴子012---Just a second. Hope you find your monkey.
噢，不，等一下等一下012---Oh, no, wait. No, no, no. Wait, wait.
暖气炉我们可能不太熟悉…012---Um, we may not know about radiators, per se...
但是我们对环境的冷暖…012---...but we do have a certain amount of expertise...
有一定程度的认知012---...in the heating and cooling milieu.
我们不是还有事情要做吗？012---Uh, weren't we kind of in the middle of something here?
对，但是这些女人很热 而且需要我们帮忙012---Yes, but these women are very hot and they need our help.
而且还很辣012---And they're very hot.
我们不可以这样，好吗？012---We can't, all right?
很遗憾012---We're sorry.
你们不知道我们有多遗憾 但是我们已经答应要去找猴子012---You have no idea how sorry. But we promised we'd find this monkey.
如果你们看到他，他大概这么高 叫他马塞尔他会回应012---If you see him, he's about yea high and answers to the name Marcel.
如果我们能够有你们的照片 那对我们帮助很大012---So if we could get some pictures of you, you'd really be helping us out.
好吧，从现在开始 你不准跟外人说话012---Okay, from now on, you don't get to talk to other people.
- 马塞尔？ - 马塞尔012---- Marcel? - Marcel.
马塞尔？012---PHOEBE & MONICA: Marcel?
马塞尔？012---Marcel?
- 噢，天啊 - 怎么了？012---- Oh, my God. - What?
有东西拂过我的右腿012---Something just brushed up against my right leg.
那是什么？012---- What is it? - Oh.
噢，没什么 那是我的左腿012---Oh, it's okay. It was just my left leg.
你看，菲比012---MONICA: Look, Phoebe.
噢，太好了 噢，马塞尔，过来012---Oh, yeah. Oh, Marcel. Come here.
- 过来，马塞尔 - 两位小姐，请让开012---- Oh, come here, Marcel. - Step aside, ladies.
- 你要做什么？ - 只是一点镇静剂012---- What are you gonna do? - Just a small tranquilizer.
快跑，马塞尔，快跑！ 跑啊，马塞尔！012---PHOEBE: Run, Marcel, run! Run, Marcel!
- 该死 - 你还好吧？012---- Damn. - Are you okay?
噢，还好，应该没事012---Oh, yeah, I think so.
哦012---Oh.
呵012---Huh.
哇012---Whoa.
噢，天啊012---Oh, gosh.
- 马塞尔 - 马塞尔012---ROSS & RACHEL: Marcel. Marcel.
这太荒谬了 我们整个社区都找过了012---This is ridiculous. We've been all over the neighborhood.
他跑掉了，他跑掉了012---He's gone. He's just gone.
- 罗斯，你怎么知道？ - 噢，拜托，现在又冷又暗012---- Ross, you don't know that. - Oh, come on. It's cold, it's dark.
他根本不熟悉格林威治村012---He doesn't know the Village.
现在我的脚骨断了 噢，我的…012---And now I have a broken foot. Oh, my...
我的猴子不见了，再加上断脚012---I have no monkey and a broken foot.
