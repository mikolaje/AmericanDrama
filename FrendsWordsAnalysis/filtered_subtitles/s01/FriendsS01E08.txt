《老友记》 第一季 第8集：奶奶死了两次012---Friends S01E08: The One Where Nana Dies Twice
经过那件事之后 真的很难继续享受拉面 很夸张对吧012---CHANDLER: It's hard to enjoy noodles after that. Is that ridiculous?
你们能相信 她真的这样认为吗012---Can you believe she actually thought that?
可以012---Yeah.
我刚认识你的时候  我想说或许…012---Well, when I first met you, I thought maybe...
有可能…012---...possibly...
你可能是012---...you might be.
真的012---You did?
然后你在菲比的生日派对上 一直对我的胸部说话…012---Then you spent Phoebe's birthday party talking to my breasts...
所以我想说应该不是012---...so then I figured maybe not.
你们其他人刚认识我的时候 有那么想吗012---Huh. Did, uh, any of the rest of you guys think that when you first met me?
- 我有 - 我想有012---- I did. - I think so.
- 我没有 - 不…我也没有012---- Not me. - No, no, me neither.
不过大学时期的苏珊有012---Although, uh, back in college, Susan Saladore did.
你在开玩笑012---You're kidding.
- 你有跟她说我不是吗  - 没有012---- Did you tell her I wasn't? - No.
因为我想跟她交往012---It's because I wanted to go out with her too.
所以我跟她说 你和伯尼交往…012---So I told her, actually, you were seeing Bernie Spellman...
伯尼也喜欢她012---...who also liked her.
太有趣了012---Well, this is fascinating.
那是什么原因012---So, uh, what is it about me?
我不知道，因为你很聪明、好笑…012---I don't know. Because you're smart, you're funny...
罗斯也是啊 你们有想过他是吗012---Ross is smart and funny. You ever think that about him?
- 是啊 - 那到底是什么原因012---- Ha, ha. Yeah, right. - What is it?
我不知道，你就是… 你有种特质012---Okay, I don't know. You just... You have a quality.
- 没错 - 对，某种特质012---- Yes, exactly. - Right?
有种特质012---Yeah, a quality.
〝特质〞，很好 因为我很担心你们会说得很模糊012---"A quality." Good. I was worried you were gonna be vague about this.
喂012---Hello?
喂012---Hello?
瑞秋，是罗马的巴洛012---Oh. Rachel. It's Paolo calling from Rome.
天啊 他从罗马打来012---Oh, my God. Calling from Rome.
他从罗马打来 我也做得到啊012---So he's calling from Rome. I could do that.
只要去罗马就行了012---Just gotta go to Rome.

我在跟罗马通话012---I'm talking to Rome.
跟我通话的人在罗马012---talking to Rome...
爸，什么事012---Hey, Dad. What's up?

罗斯，是奶奶012---Ross, it's Nana.
嘿012---Hey.
- 你们好吗  - 嘿，爸012---MONICA: How you doing? ROSS: Hey, Dad.

医生说只剩几小时了012---The doctor says it's a matter of hours.
- 你还好吗，妈 - 我 我很好012---- How are you, Mom? - Me? I'm fine, fine.
我很高兴你来了012---I'm glad you're here.
你的头发怎么了012---What's with your hair?
怎么了012---What?
有什么不同012---What's different?
没有啊012---Nothing.
噢，大概就是这样吧012---Oh, maybe that's it.
她实在是令人难以置信 她母亲…012---She's unbelievable. Her mother's...
好，放轻松点012---Okay, relax, relax.
看来我们还要在这里 待一段时问012---We are gonna be here a while, it looks like.
免不了还要谈你男友 和工作的事012---We still have boyfriends and your career to cover.
天啊012---Oh, God.
她皮包里有发霉的薄荷糖012---The fuzzy little mints at the bottom of her purse.
对，超恶心的012---Yeah, they were gross.
你们知道我最爱什么吗012---Oh, you know what I love?
她的代糖012---Her Sweet 'N Lows.
她老是从餐厅偷代糖012---How she was always stealing them from restaurants.
不只是餐厅 还有我们家012---Not just restaurants, from our house.
盖勒太太012---Mrs. Geller?
她看起来好小一只012---ROSS: She looks so small.
我知道012---I know.
至少她现在有阿公 和菲利斯婶婶陪伴012---Well, at least she's with Pop-Pop and Aunt Phyllis now.
再见了，奶奶012---Goodbye, Nana.
别了，奶奶012---Bye, Nana.
罗斯！012---Ross!
护士012---Nurse.
怎么了012---What is going on?
护士不是说奶奶走了吗012---You know, uh, how the nurse said Nana had passed?
但并不是012---Well, she's not quite.
- 什么  - 她没走012---- What? - She's not passed.
她还在，她回来了012---She's present. She's back.
怎么了012---What's going on?
她可能死了012---She may have died.
〝她可能死了〞012---"She may have died"?
我们还在观察012---We're looking into it.
我进去看看012---Uh, I'll go see.
这种事几乎不可能发生012---This almost never happens.
现在她走了012---Now she's passed.
我一定得知道012---I just have to know, okay?
是我的头发吗012---Is it my hair?
没错，钱德，就是这样 你的头发012---Yes, Chandler, that's exactly what it is. It's your hair.
对，你有同志头发012---Yeah, you have homosexual hair.
- 嘿 - 嗨012---RACHEL: Hey. MONICA: Hi.
那她…012---RACHEL: So did she?
两次012---Twice.
真是糟透了012---Oh, that sucks.
你们还好吗012---You guys okay?
我不知道，感觉好怪012---I don't know. It's weird.
我知道她走了 但我就是不觉得…012---I know she's gone, but I just don't feel, uh...
或许是因为 她没有真的走了012---Maybe that's because she's not really gone.
不，她走了012---No, no, she's gone.
我们有检查012---We checked.
很多次012---A lot.
我是说，或许人不会真的走012---No, I mean, maybe no one ever really goes.
自从我妈死掉后 我偶尔…012---Ever since my mom died, every now and then...
会感觉到她就在这里012---...I get this feeling that she's, like, right here, you know?
还有我国中最好的朋友，黛比…012---Oh. And Debbie, my best friend from junior high...
她去打迷你高尔夫时 被问电击中012---...got struck by lightning on a miniature golf course.
用黄色的铅笔时012---I always get this strong Debbie vibe...
我总是能感应到黛比012---...whenever I use one of those little yellow pencils.
我好想她012---I miss her.
菲比，你想要这个吗012---Want this?
- 噢，谢了 - 不客气012---- Oh, thanks. - Sure.
我今早才把它削尖的012---I just sharpened her this morning.
我完全不相信那一套 你死掉后…012---See, I don't believe any of that. I think when you're dead...
就是死了，消失了 成了虫的食物012---...you're dead. You're gone. You're worm food.
钱德看起来很像同志对吧012---So Chandler looks gay, huh?
我不知道这是谁 但绝不是黛比012---I don't know who this is, but it's not Debbie.
我以为要用密封的棺木012---I thought it'd be a closed casket.
这不代表她不能 看起来体面一点012---Well, that doesn't mean she can't look nice.
孩子，你想你进得去吗012---Sweetie, you think you can get in there?
当然可以012---I don't see why not.
我的牙齿矫正器在这里012---ROSS: Here's my retainer.
我一直在想…012---I was just thinking...
- 轮到我的时候… - 爸012---...when my time comes... - Dad.
听我说012---Listen to me.
轮到我的时候 我想海葬012---When my time comes, I wanna be buried at sea.
什么012---You what?
我想葬在海里 看起来很好玩012---I wanna be buried at sea. It looks like fun.
解释一下〝好玩〞的意思012---Define "fun."
别这样，那一天你们会很开心的 租艘船，带些午餐…012---Come on. You'll make a day of it. You'll get a boat, pack a lunch...
然后把你的尸体丢到海里 听起来真好玩012---And then we throw your body in the water. Gee, that does sound fun.
大家都以为很了解我012---Everyone thinks they know me.
大家都说杰克盖勒 太好猜了012---Everyone says, "Jack Geller, so predictable."
或许我走后，他们会说 〝海葬？〞012---Maybe after I'm gone, they'll say, "Buried at sea? Huh."
他们大概就会这样说012---That's probably what they'll say.
我喜欢这样012---I'd like that.
- 嘿，美女 - 嘿012---- Hey, gorgeous. - Hey.
听着，昨天的事 我很抱歉012---Look, I'm sorry about yesterday.
别担心，显然其他人 也会犯相同的错误012---Don't worry about it. Apparently, other people have made the same mistake.
那好012---Oh. Okay. Phew.
那你觉得我是哪里像012---So, uh, what do you think it is about me?
我不知道012---I don't know what.
你就是有种…012---You just have...
- 特质 - 特质，对，太好了012---...a quality. - A quality. Right. Great.
太可惜，因为你和罗威尔 会是很棒的一对012---It's a shame, because you and Lowell would've made a great couple.
罗威尔 金融服务部的罗威尔  你认为我适合跟他在一起012---Lowell? Financial Services Lowell? That's who you saw me with?
干嘛 他很可爱啊012---What? He's cute.
是啊012---Well, yeah.
他比出纳处的布莱恩好多了012---He's no Brian in Payroll.
布莱恩是…012---Is Brian?
不，我不知道 重点是，如果你要撮合我跟某人…012---No. I don't know. The point is, if you were gonna set me up...
我会希望是像他那样的人012---...I'd like to think it'd be with somebody like him.
我认为你配不上布莱恩012---Well, I think Brian's a little out of your league.
不好意思 你认为 我追不到布莱恩012---Excuse me. You don't think I could get a Brian?
因为我绝对可以追到布莱恩 相信我012---Because I could get a Brian. Believe you me.
我真的不是012---I'm really not.
这一件012---ROSS: This one?
不好012---No.
我已经给你们看过 所有洋装了012---I've shown you every dress we have.
除非你们想让她穿着 柠檬黄色套装入土…012---Unless you want her to spend eternity in a lemon-yellow pantsuit...
不然就选酒红色012---...go with the burgundy.
不管我们选什么 她都不会满意012---Whatever we pick, she would've told us it's the wrong one.
没错，就选酒红色012---You're right. We'll go with the burgundy.
很棒的选择，我要出来了012---A fine choice. I'm coming out.
等等，我们还需要鞋子012---Wait. We need shoes.
好012---Okay. Uh...
这些如何012---How about these?
那些是日鞋012---That's really a day shoe.
她去的地方 别人的打扮会更隆重吗012---And where she's going, everyone else will be dressier?
能找鞋跟细一点的鞋吗012---Could we see something in a slimmer heel?
好，我找不到酒红色的晚鞋012---Okay. I have nothing in an evening shoe in the burgundy.
不过有双银色的鞋或许适合012---I can show you something in a silver that may work.
不行，一定要酒红色012---No, it really should be burgundy.
- 除非我们挑另一件洋装 - 对012---- Unless we go with a different dress. - Yes.
不、不、不，我看看012---No, no, no. Watch this.
等等，后面或许有适合的012---Wait, I may have something in the back.
天啊012---Oh, my God.
- 没事吧  - 没事012---Is everything all right, dear?
只是奶奶的东西012---Just Nana's stuff.
大家怎么样  都好了吗012---How we doing? You guys ready?
妈打电话给我 提醒我不要把头发绑起来012---Mom called to remind me not to wear my hair up.
知道我的耳朵 不是我最漂亮的部位吗012---Did you know my ears were not my best feature?
有时候我会一直耿耿于怀012---Some days it's all I can think about.
抱歉我迟到了 我找不到我的耳圈012---Hi. I'm sorry I'm late. I couldn't find my bearings.
你是说耳环吗012---Heh. You mean your earrings?
我说了什么？012---What did I say?
- 就是这双鞋子吗 - 对，巴洛从意大利寄过来的012---- Are these the shoes? - Yes. Paolo sent them from Italy.
干嘛 我们这里 没有鞋子吗012---What? We, uh, don't have shoes here?
早安  准备好出发了吗012---Morning. We ready to go?
打扮后，我们看起来都很棒吧012---Don't we look nice all dressed up?
就是这类的评论吧012---It's stuff like that, isn't it?
- 真的是很棒的仪式 - 的确012---- It was a beautiful service. - It really was.
过来，亲爱的012---Come here, sweetheart.
你知道…012---You know...
我认为该是你 开始使用晚霜的时候了012---...I think it's time for you to start using night cream.
干嘛012---What?
没什么，只是你的大衣很吵012---Nothing. Just your overcoat sounds remarkably like Brent Musburger.
你看看，《巨人队》对《牛仔队》012---Check it out. Giants-Cowboys.
你在葬礼时看美式足球赛？012---You're watching football at a funeral?
不，这只是赛前分析 待会在宴会上才要看012---No, it's the pregame. I'm gonna watch it at the reception.
你这个人真是充满惊奇012---You're a frightening, frightening man.
噢，不会吧，我的巴洛鞋012---RACHEL: Oh, no. My new Paolo shoes.
希望鞋没坏012---Oh. I hope they're not ruined.
天啊，真是美好的一天012---PHOEBE: God, what a great day.
干嘛？我是说天气012---What? Weatherwise.
我知道012---I know.
空气和树木012---The air, the trees.
虽然奶奶走了 但是…012---Even though Nana's gone, there's something almost, uh, life...
- 罗斯，你没事吧 - 罗斯！012---- Ross, are you okay? - Ross!
我没事012---I'm fine. No, I'm fine.
只是…012---Just...
我最大的梦魇终于成真 不过…012---...having my worst fear realized, but...
不用担心，我只是看看 你是否肌肉痉挛012---PHOEBE: I'm just checking to see if the muscle's in spasm.
- 呵  - 怎么了？012---- Huh. - What? What is it?
- 你少穿了一个皮带孔  - 噢012---- You missed a belt loop. - Ugh.

《巨人队》以17分对14分领先 第三节只剩三分钟012---17-14, Giants. Three minutes to go in the third.
太好了012---Beautiful.
菲比，你可以拿块饼干给我吗012---Pheebs, could you maybe hand me a cracker?
你奶奶一定不会喜欢的012---Your grandmother would've hated this.
当然，这是她的葬礼012---Well, sure. What with it being her funeral and all.
不，我会一直听到她说…012---No, I'd be hearing about...
为什么没有蜜糖火腿012---...why didn't I get the honey-glazed ham?
或是我买的花不够 又或者是…012---Or I didn't spend enough on flowers. If I spent more, she'd say:
何必浪费那么多钱  我都死了012---"Why waste your money? I don't need flowers, I'm dead."
听起来很像奶奶的口气012---That sounds like Nana.
知道和批评你每句话的人012---Do you know what it's like to grow up...
在一起生活是什么滋味吗？012---...with someone who is critical of every single thing you say?
我想像得到012---I can imagine.
我告诉你，你的母亲012---I tell you, it's a wonder your mother turned out...
变得这么乐观、积极的人真的很神奇012---...to be the positive, life-affirming person she is.
真的很神奇012---That is a wonder.
妈，告诉我 如果可以重来…012---So tell me something, Mom. If you had to do it all over again...
如果此时此刻她在这里…012---...I mean, if she was here right now...
你会告诉她吗012---...would you tell her?
告诉她什么012---Tell her what?
她如何使你抓狂 挑剔每一件小事012---How she drove you crazy, picking on every little detail.
譬如说你的头发012---Like your hair, for example.
我不太懂你在说什么012---I'm not sure I know what you're getting at.
如果你说出实话 情况会好一点吗012---Would things have been better if you'd just told her the truth?
不会012---No.
我认为某些事 还是不要说比较好012---I think some things are better left unsaid.
家和万事兴012---I think it's nicer when people just get along.
再来些酒吗012---More wine, dear?
当然012---Oh, I think so.
你戴这副耳环真好看012---Those earrings look really lovely on you.
谢谢012---Thank you.
是你的耳环012---They're yours.
其实是奶奶的012---Actually, they were Nana's.
真叫人难过012---Now I'm depressed.

这个裸体的小家伙是谁012---Hey, who's this little naked guy?
那个裸体的小家伙就是我012---Uh, that little naked guy would be me.

- 这些人是谁？ - 考倒我了012---- Who are those people? - Got me.
中间那个是奶奶012---- That's Nana right there in the middle. - Wow.

24、25岁吧012---Uh, twenty-four, twenty-five.
看起来很好玩的一群人012---Huh. It looks like a fun gang.
你们快看，有摩妮卡裸体的照片012---Ooh, look, look, look. I got Monica naked.
我看看012---Let me see.

我在尝试新事物012---I'm, uh, just trying something.
- 嘿，罗威尔 - 嘿，钱德012---- Hey, Lowell. - Oh, hey, Chandler.
金融服务处还好吗012---So how's it going in Financial Services?
简直是一团乱012---It's like Mardi Gras without the papier-mâché heads.
你们呢012---How about you?
很好，听着…012---Good. Good. Listen, um, heh...
我不知道雪莉怎么跟你说我的事 但是…012---...I don't know what Shelly told you about me, but, uh...
我并不是012---...I'm not.
我知道，我也是这样跟她说的012---I know. That's what I told her.
- 真的吗  - 对012---- Really? - Yeah.
你看得出来？012---So you can tell?
大部分的时候是的 我们有种…雷达012---Pretty much. Most of the time. We have a kind of radar.
所以你不认为我有…012---So you don't think I have...
那种特质012---...a quality?
代表男同志发言 我得说没有012---Speaking for my people, I'd have to say no.
对了，你的朋友，出纳处的布莱恩？ 他是同志012---By the way, your friend Brian from Payroll? He is.
- 他是  - 对012---- He is? - Yep.
