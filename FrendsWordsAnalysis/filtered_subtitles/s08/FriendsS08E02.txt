听着  先生  我最后一次告诉你012---Listen, you know what, sir, for the last time,
我不管电脑上登记了什么012---I don't care what the computer says.
我们没从房间冰箱拿走一包糖果012---We did not take a bag of Mashuga Nuts from the minibar.
我们也没看《热心"助"人的医生》012---And we did not watch Dr. DoMeALittle.
乔伊  昨晚你到过我们房间吗  没有012--- Joey, were you in our room last night?  No.
他们说电影片名不会出现在帐单上012---I was told the name of the movie would not appear on the bill.
我们要退掉新婚套房012---We're checking out of the bridal suite.
没错  我不再是新娘了012---That's right, I'm no longer a bride.
也永远都当不了新娘012---I'll never be a bride again.
现在我不过是某人的太太012---Now I'm just someone's wife.
而我是全世界最幸福的男人012---And I'm the happiest guy in the world.
亲爱的  别难过012---Come on. Honey, don't be upset.
我们的未来充满期待  可不是嘛012--- We still have so much to look forward to.  Yeah, right.
我们还要去度蜜月012---We got the honeymoon.
那还要等到星期四012---That's not till Thursday.
还有婚纱照012---The wedding pictures.
那得等上好几个星期012---It won't be ready for weeks.
但婚宴上用"即可拍"拍的照片马上可以洗好012---Not the disposable cameras from the tables.
没错  我就知道我嫁给你是有原因的012---That's true. I knew I married you for a reason!
听着  我拿照片去洗  你先回家吧012---Tell you what, I will go get them developed, and you can go home.
好012---Okay.
怎么  你拍了什么  没什么012--- What? What did you take a picture of?  Nothing.
绝对精彩哦012---It was something.
即可拍在罗斯那里  他还没有退房吗012---Ross has the cameras. Has he checked out yet?
你开什么玩笑  退房时间是中午012---Are you joking? Checkout is not till noon.
他还有11分钟  所以呢012--- And he has a good 11 minutes left.  So?
罗斯从来不会提早退房  一分钟都不浪费012---So Ross had never checked out of a room a minute before he had to.
我们在交往的时候  有一次延后退房012---One time, when we were dating, we got a late checkout.
他异常兴奋  那是我们最性福的一次012---He got so excited, it was the best sex we ever had.
结果他最后大喊"雷迪森酒店"  真扫兴012---Until he screamed out "Radisson" at the end.
好吧  我去找罗斯拿照相机012---Okay, well, I'm gonna get Ross, get the cameras
然后把底片拿去洗012---and get them developed.
乔伊  你都32岁了  别那么幼稚行吗012---32, Joe. You're 32!
这是你的帐单  谢谢012--- Here's a copy of your bill.  Thanks.
香槟  草莓...012---Champagne, strawberries...
天啊012---Oh, my God!
我不敢相信钱德勒在我们的新婚之夜看黄片012---I can't believe Chandler ordered porn on our wedding night.
对  真可悲012---Yeah, that's sad.
来点糖果吧012---Mashuga Nut?
《老友记》  第八季  第2集  红毛线衫012---Friends S08E02 The One With The Red Sweater
肥皂  洗发水  你真的要带这些东西吗012---Soaps, shampoos. Are you really taking all this stuff?
为什么不行  这全包含在房费里012---Why not? It's built into the price of the room.
对  但你不需要...  这是什么012---Yeah, but you don't need... What is this?
针线包012---Thread.
答对了012---Score!
即可拍在哪里012---Where are the disposable cameras?
什么即可拍012---What disposable cameras?
昨晚我把它们交给你保管012---The cameras. Remember last night I asked you to take them.
才没有  怎么没有  记得吗012--- No, you didn't.  Yes, remember?
在切蛋糕前  我找到你说...012---Right before we cut the cake, I went up to you and I said...
对  你问我能不能帮你一个忙012---Yeah, you asked me if I could do you a favor.
这时墨瑞叔叔走过来交给你一张支票012---Then my Uncle Murray came up to you and handed you a check.
然后你问"它为什么叫做支票012---Then you said, "Why is it called a check?
为什么不叫南斯拉夫人"012---Why not a Yugoslavian?"
对  然后你笑得魂不附体012---Yeah, then you did that,
即可拍不在你手上  没错  抱歉012--- So you don't have the cameras?  No, sorry, man.
那怎么办  相机不见了  莫妮卡会气疯的012---So, what? They're gone? Monica's gonna freak!
它们应该就在酒店里某个地方012---I'm sure they're somewhere here in the hotel.
我帮你找012---I'll help you look for that.
太棒了  再等三分钟012--- Great.  In three minutes.
你要丢下钱德勒  自己拆礼物吗012---Are you gonna open the presents without Chandler?
不  我只是012---No! I'm just...
它们在呼换我012---They're calling out to me.
这个小家伙甚至都爬到我大腿上了012---This little guy even crawled up in my lap.
我就拆一样礼物  钱德勒不会介意的012---Chandler wouldn't mind if I opened just one present.
你觉得这是什么012---What do you think it is?
是一面小镜子 只要你一照...012---A little mirror that, when you look into it...
就会发现自己变成了老太婆012---...you see yourself as an old woman.
是个迷你盐罐012---A tiny salt shaker!
天啊  是用来装迷你盐的012---Oh, my God, for tiny salt!
好吧  拆礼物真好玩  是啊012--- Oh, wow! Okay. Well, that was fun.  Oh, yeah.
我会等钱德勒回来012---Okay, I'll just wait for Chandler
一起拆其他礼物  好012--- to open up the rest of them.  Okay.
但这只是调味瓶组的一部分012---Although, you know, this is part of a saltandpepper set.
它只能算半份礼物  你觉得呢012---It may just count as only half a present. What do you think?
如果这是一套的012---I guess it's okay to open one more
再拆开一样应该没关系  就这个吧012---if it's part of a set. It's probably this one.
或是这个012---Or this one!
你感觉怎样  晨吐了吗012---How are you feeling? Got any morning sickness?
男生们还不知道吧012---The guys don't know yet, do they?
乔伊跟罗斯什么都不知道012---No, Joey and Ross don't know anything.
钱德勒还以为是菲比怀孕了012---And Chandler still thinks Phoebe's pregnant.
没错  钱德勒还以为是我怀孕了012---That's right. Chandler does still think I'm pregnant.
他没问我感觉如何 也没帮我提袋子012---He hasn't asked me how I'm feeling or offered to carry my bags.
我真替跟他在一起的女人觉得难过012---I feel bad for the woman who ends up with him.
我是指在你之后的女人012---After you, of course.
别担心  你只需要再假装怀孕几小时012---Don't worry. I promise you only have to be pregnant for a few more hours
因为今天我要告诉孩子他爸了012---...because I'm telling the father today.
他就住在这栋公寓吗012---Is it someone in the building?
是一楼那个高个子吗012---That tall guy on the first floor?
才不是呢012---No!
怎么  我觉得他很帅啊012---What? I think he's cute.
那你可以去怀他的孩子012---Then you have his baby.
相信我  我正在努力012---Believe me, I'm trying.
这种感觉真奇怪  你今天就要告诉这个男人012---It's so weird. You're gonna tell this guy today...
而他完全不知道会发生什么事012---...and he has no idea what's gonna happen.
你马上就要敲开他的门012---Yeah. You're just gonna knock on his door
永远改变他的生活012---and change his life forever.
你就像艾德·麦马汉012---You're like Ed McMahon,
只是手上没有拿大额支票012---except without the big check.
也缺乏原始的性吸引力012---Or the raw sexual magnetism.
对  这确实是个大消息012---Yeah, well, I guess it is pretty big news.
大消息  这可是个天大的消息012---Pretty big? It's huge!
天啊  这个男人什么都不知道012---God, this guy doesn't have a clue.
他走在街上心想012---He's just walking down the street thinking,
"我跟瑞秋·格林做爱了  我太帅了"012---"I had sex with Rachel Greene. I rock!"
然后  砰  他突然当了爸爸  一切都变了012---Then, bam! He's a father, everything's different.
除非他真的想当爸爸012---It's only different if he wants it to be.
我不会对他提出任何要求012---I'm not gonna ask him for anything.
他还是得做出重大的决定012---Okay, then. He still has this huge decision to make.
现在他边走边想012---Now he's walking around thinking,
"我要当爸爸吗"  然后  砰012---"Do I want to be a dad?" Then, bam!
这次怎么了012---What was that "bam"?
我不知道  他可能是被公车撞了012---I don't know. He's hit by a bus, or something.
乔伊  如果跟你上过床的女人012---Joey, what would you do if someone you slept with
告诉你她怀孕了  你会怎么办012---told you she was pregnant?
谁打电话过来了012---Who called here?
她听起来像金发美女吗012---Did she sound blond?
她有口音吗  我得去打个电话012---Did she have an accent? I gotta make a call.
我就不该进太阳眼镜屋的012---Should have never walked into that Sunglass Hut!
不是你  你没有让任何人怀孕012---Joey, Joey. It's not you! You didn't get anybody pregnant.
你为什么要那样子吓我012---Why would you scare me like that?
发生了什么事012---What the hell's going on?
有人怀孕了吗012---Is somebody pregnant?
对  我怀孕了012---Oh, yeah! That's me.
天啊  菲比 你要生孩子了012---Oh, my God, Pheebs! You're gonna have a baby?
对  天啊  我要生孩子了012---Yes, I am. Oh, my God, I'm gonna have a baby!
等一下  孩子他爸是谁012---Wait a minute, who's the father?
你不认识他  那不重要012---You don't know him. It's not important.
他不希望跟我或孩子扯上关系012---He wants nothing to do with me or the baby.
这家伙是谁012---Who is this guy? Who is he?
我要找到他  痛扁他一顿012---Because I will track him down and kick his ass!
大卫·林恩  大卫·林恩012--- David Linn.  David Linn!
大卫`林恩  大卫`林恩012---David Linn. David Linn!
谁是大卫·林恩012---Who's David Linn?
我在健身房认识的人  他有点烦人012---Some guy from my gym. Little annoying.
钱德勒  你找到即可拍了吗012--- Chandler?  Did you find the cameras?
没有  你呢  我找到了012--- No. Did you?  Yes.
所以我才趴在桌底下  庆祝这一幸事012---That's why I'm under the table, celebrating.
我去失物招领中心问过管理员012---I checked in the lost and found. I talked to the manager.
没有人捡到即可拍012---No one's turned them in.
这下可好了  今天只有那些即可拍012---This is great. Those cameras were the only thing
才能让莫妮卡打起精神来  她心情很低落012---that was gonna cheer Monica up today. She's really depressed.
你们刚刚结婚  她为什么心情不好012---You guys just got married. Why is she so depressed?
我卯足了劲不去问她那个问题012---All my energy is going into not asking that question.
不敢相信我给搞砸了012---I can't believe I screwed this up!
我很遗憾  兄弟012---I'm sorry, man.
我有个点子  你们就是在这个宴会厅请的客012---Here's a thought. This is the same ballroom.
这里有乐队  等一下会有很多人盛装前来012---There's a band. There's gonna be plenty of dressedup people.
你是说我们可以一跳解千愁012---Are you suggesting we dance our troubles away?
不  我是说我们到礼品店买一些即可拍012---No, no, no, I'm saying we buy more of these at the gift shop...
换上礼服拍几张照片012---...throw our tuxes back on and take a few pictures.
我们只要不拍到任何人的脸就行012---All we have to make sure not to get anybody's faces.
你是认真的吗012---Are you serious?
我是想到在家等你的新娘012---I'm just thinking about your new bride at home, okay?
你想在携手共度一生的第一天就让她失望吗012---Do you want to start your life together by letting her down?
你真的要给我关于婚姻的建议吗012---Marriage advice? Really?
我是在告诉你  这看起来很像你的婚宴现场012---I'm telling you, this looks exactly like your wedding.
连这些花都是一样吧012---Aren't these the same flowers?
我不知道  花是莫妮卡挑的012---I don't know. Monica picked out the flowers.
椅子呢  也是她挑的012--- What about the chairs?  She picked out those too.
那会场布置呢  她挑的012--- How about the place settings?  That was her.
你做了什么  我负责看好照相机012--- What did you do?  I was in charge of the cameras.
去礼品店吧012---Gift shop?
你说了吗  还没有012--- Did you do it yet?  Not yet.
那么你在这里做什么  你准备要说了吗012---Then what are you doing here? Are you about to do it?
是甘瑟吗  不是012--- Is it Gunther?  No.
不是甘瑟012---Phoebe, it's not Gunther!
谢天谢地  还好宝宝不会随他的头发012---Thank God. Because that hair on a baby?
孩子他爸不在这里012---Phoebe, the father is not here, okay?
我还没有告诉他  我现在根本没办法告诉他012---I haven't told him yet. I don't think I can tell him at all now.
为什么  让我想想012--- Why not?  I don't konw. Let me think.
我在街上边走边想012---I was walking down the street, thinking,
"我今天要告诉孩子他爸了"  然后  砰012---"I'm gonna tell the father." And then, bam!
你被公车撞了吗012---Bus?
不  是你  我被你吓到了012---No, you! Phoebe, you freaked me out.
你一直在提醒我这是件大事012---You kept saying how huge this all is.
但这的确是件大事012---But it is huge.
我知道  但我只是在想这对我来说有多重要012---I know. But I was just thinking about how huge it was for me.
我根本没去想这对孩子他爸来说有多重要012---I didn't even go to how huge it'll be for the father.
你想得太多了012---You're thinking about this way too much.
就直接告诉他  把事情做个了断012---Just tell him and get it over with.
就像撕掉创可贴一样  越快越不痛  你看012---It's like ripping off this BandAid, quick and painless. Watch.
天杀的...012---Oh, mother of...!
看吧012---See?
要拆礼物了吗012---Are we opening presents?
不  我根本不该拆礼物012---No. I shouldn't have even opened these.
乔伊  我控制不了自己012---Joey, I am out of control!
你得帮我一个忙012---Joey, you have to do me a favor.
不论我说什么  不论我做什么012---No matter what I say, no matter what I do...
拜托  不要让我再拆礼物了  好吗012---...please, do not let me open another present. Okay?
好012---Okay.
再给我一个礼物  好012--- Give me one more.  Okay.
很好  你来了  菲比  听我说012---Oh, good, you're here. Pheebs? Listen...
坐下  我要告诉你一件事  好吧012--- Sit down, I got something I wanna say.  All right.
外面的世界很可怕012---It's a scary world out there,
特别是对单亲妈妈来说012---especially for a single mom.
我一直觉得你我之间有种特殊的联系012---I've always felt that you and I have a special bond.
所以...012---So...
菲比·布菲  你愿意嫁给我吗012---Phoebe Buffay, will you marry me?
我的天啊012---Oh, my God!
乔伊  我愿意嫁给你012--- Joey.  Oh, yeah, I'll marry you.
你不能嫁给他012---You can't marry him!
小姐  你的风光之日过去了  这次轮到我了012---Hey, lady, your day's over. It's my turn.
菲比  她为什么不能嫁给我012--- Phoebe.  Why can't she marry me?
我可以  我也愿意012---I can and I will.
她没有怀孕012---She's not pregnant.

他会发现的012---in nine months!
他可是乔伊012---It's Joey!
我爱你012---I love you.
等一下  我不敢相信瑞秋怀孕了012---Wait, I can't believe it! Rachel's pregnant?
孩子他爸是谁012---Who's the father?
我们不知道012---We don't know.
不知道是不是那个家伙012---I wonder if it's that dude.
你知道有这么个人  对012--- There's a dude?  Yeah.
是谁呢012---Who is it?
大约一个月前  这家伙跟瑞秋共度春宵012---About a month ago this guy spent the night with Rachel.
我没有看到是谁  但是...012---I didn't see who it was, but...
他把故事讲完了吗012---Was that story over?
那家伙留下了这个012---The guy left this.

你为什么不帮我们拍照012---Why won't you take our picture?
好  我来帮你们拍012---Oh, yeah. I'll take your picture.
你的手指挡到镜头了012---Your finger was covering the lens.
你是安瑟·亚当斯吗  快滚吧012---Who are you, Ansel Adams? Get out of here! 
之前吓到你了  我真的很过意不去012---Look, I feel really bad about how I freaked you out before...
所以我打电话把孩子他爸叫到这里见你012---...so I called the father and asked the father to meet you here
你可以告诉他事实  去吧012---so you could tell him. Go!
什么  等一下012---What? Wait a minute.
你怎么知道孩子他爸是谁012---Phoebe, how do you even know who the father is?
或许有时候我会装傻012---I may play the fool at times...
但事实上我是个永不放弃的金发美女012---but I'm more than a pretty blond girl with an ass that won't quit.
我相信这是孩子他爸的衣服012---I believe this belongs to the father of your baby...
天啊012---Oh, God.
他就在里面吗012---He's in there right now?
你可以转身离开  或是长痛不如短痛012---You can turn around, or you can go rip the BandAid off.
你打算怎么做012---What do you want to do?
我们把事情做个了断吧  你确定012--- Let's rip.  Are you sure?
菲比  好吧  抱歉012--- Phoebe!  Okay. Sorry.

没事  菲比搞错了012---Nothing. Phoebe kind of made a mistake.
但你的确常穿那件毛衣012---But you do wear that sweater a lot.
你这是在玩什么"大冒险"吗012---Are you involved in some kind of dare?
事实上我很高兴能接到菲比的电话012---I'm actually glad Phoebe called.
我知道我们会分手是因为你觉得我太幼稚012---I know we broke up because you thought I was immature enough,
但我已经长大了012---but I've really grown up.
我觉得我们应该复合012---I think we should get back together.
时机不对012---It's just not the right time.
时机非常恰当  好吧012--- It is the right time.  Okay.
我做了万全的准备012---I'm ready for more.
泰格  来吧  瑞秋我们再试一次012--- Tag.  Come on, Rach. Let's give it another try.

你拆开了我爸妈的礼物012---You got my parents' gift.
那是什么012---Yeah. What is that?
应该是跟意大利腊肠有关的东西012---I don't know. I think it does something to salami.
情况如何  泰格怎么说012--- How'd it go?  What did Tag say?
泰格不是孩子他爸  乔伊竟然知道了012---Tag is not the father. And Joey knows now?
我知道了  瑞秋  我为你感到高兴012---I do, Rach, I do. And I am so happy for you.
你竟然没想要解开我的胸罩012---Wow, you didn't even try to unook my bra.
你还打算要告诉孩子他爸吗012---So are you ever gonna tell whoever it is?
我会的  我只是不想今晚告诉他012---I will. I'm just not up for it tonight.
不论这家伙怎么说012---Rach, no matter what this guy says,
你都不会独自面对这一切012---I want you to know you're not gonna be alone in this.
是吗  不  听着...012--- I'm not?  No. Listen, I...
