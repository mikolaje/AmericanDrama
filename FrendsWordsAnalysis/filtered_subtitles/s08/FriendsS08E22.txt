你们在看什么012---What are you guys looking at?
是我演的一战电影的海报  你看012---It's a poster for that WWI movie I'm in. Check it out.
看起来很暴力嘛012---Wow! It looks really violent!
我知道  我即将在各大戏院露面012---I know. I'm coming soon to a theater near you.
我经过THX认证  我不适宜儿童观看012---I'm in THX. I'm unsuitable for children!
我等不及要看这部电影了012---I cannot wait to see this.
已经有传闻说它能拿奥斯卡了012---Yeah, yeah. It's generating Oscar buzz.
是我先说的  我还以为是我012--- I started that!  I thought I did!
我刚刚跟经纪人谈过...012---Guess what? I just talked to my agent...
下星期有首映会  你们通通被邀请了012---...and the premiere is next week and you're all invited!
我们要坐加长豪华轿车吗  当然012--- Will we take a limo?  Sure! Why not?
不去参加葬礼还能坐加长车  简直太棒了012---I love taking limos when nobody died.
我显然没办法去了012---Well, obviously I won't be able to come.
那些还没查过日历的人听好了012---For those who haven't checked their calendars,
今天是我的预产期012---today's my due date.
我想借这个机会谢谢大家012---I just want take a moment and thank you guys
在我怀孕期间一直这么照顾我012---for how great you've been during this time.
没有你们我绝对办不到012---I really couldn't have done it without you.
过去的九个月我很开心012---I loved these last 9 months.
虽说我很期待进入下一阶段...012---Even though I'm looking forward to the next part...
我会很怀念怀孕的这段时光012---...I am really gonna miss being pregnant.
没错  我还是没生012---That's right. Still no baby.
拜托  给我腾点地方坐012---Come on, people, make some room.
亲爱的  或许你坐在这里会比较舒服012---Sweetie, maybe you'd be more comfortable here.
你012---You.
你对我做的孽还不够多吗012---Like you haven't done enough.
我知道你现在很痛苦012---I know how miserable you are.
我真的希望能帮上忙012---I wish there was something I could do.
我希望自己是海马012---I wish I were a sea horse.
因为是公海马负责孵育小宝宝012---Because with sea horses, it's the male. They carry the babies.
而且我还会生活在海里  离你远远的012---And then also, I'd be far away in the sea.
天啊012---God.
我这辈子从来没有这么难受过012---I have never been so uncomfortable in my entire life.
我了解  我也有过这种经历  我记得最后012---I know. I've been there. I remember toward the end...
菲比  你的故事很精彩012---Phoebe, that's a great story.
能不能帮我拿杯冰茶来再说012---Can you tell it to me when you're getting me some iced tea?
天啊  滚出来  滚出来  滚出来012---Oh, God, get out! Get out, get out, get out!
咱们滚吧012---Let's.
你生完宝宝了吗012---Hey, did you have the baby yet?
你想让我过去坐在你身上吗012---Do you want me to come over there and sit on you?
我真做得出来012---Because I'll do it.
你怎么这么早就回来了012---What are you doing here so early?
公司要我回家012---They sent me home from work.
他们让我从现在就开始休产假  回家休息012---They said, "Start your maternity leave now. Just rest."
为宝宝出生做好准备  去他们的012---Get ready for the baby. You know what? Screw them!
如果他们不要我待在公司012---If they don't want me there,
我就跟你们待在一起012---I'll hang out with you guys.
或许你可以去做义工012---Or you could do volunteer work.
喂  乔伊  我是艾丝特尔012--- Hello?  Joey, it's Estelle.
好消息  我帮搞你到了首映会的门票012---Great news. I was able to get you
你可以带一位朋友出席012---and one guest tickets to your premiere.
一位朋友  你之前说我可以拿到六张票012---One guess? You told me I could have six tickets.
我把其中四张拿去易趣网拍卖了012---Well, I sold four of them on eBay.
你会坐在"帅哥372"旁边012---You'll be sitting next to HotGuy372.
天啊  难道我就只能带一个朋友去吗012---Oh, my god. So that's it? I only get to bring one guest?
对  你什么时候来接我012---Yeah. What time you wanna pick me up?
喂012---Hello?
你们听到了吗012---You hear that?
我只能带一个朋友参加首映会012---I only get one extra ticket to my premiere.
所以我得在你们三个跟罗斯之间做选择012---So somehow I have to pick between you three and Ross.
我呢  你说过你不想去012--- What about me?  You said you didn't want to go.
没错  但我还是希望有被重视的感觉012---I don't. But I would still like to be acknowledged.
难道我怀孕了就变成隐形人了吗012---Because I'm pregnant, I'm invisible?
你绝不是隐形人012---Definitely not invisible.
罗斯根本不在这里  所以他出局了012---Ross didn't care enough to be here, so I think he's out.
你打磕睡  你就输了012---You snooze, you lose.
他没有打磕睡  他在教书012---He's not snoozing. He's teaching a class.
那么一定有人在打磕睡012---Well, then somebody's snoozing.
乔伊  不要因为我的话影响你的选择012---And, Joey, not that this should affect you at all,
但如果你选了我...012---but if you pick me...
我打算穿露到这里的紧身连衣裙012---...I was planning on wearing a sequin dress cut down to here.
我还没有看过这套连衣裙012---I haven't seen this dress.
穿上绝对有影星风范012---Star in a movie.
乔伊  你想挑谁都可以012---Joey, you pick whoever you want.
听从你内心的声音012---Listen to your heart.
它跟你说了什么012---What does it tell you?
菲比  菲比  菲比...012---Phoebe. Phoebe. Phoebe.
这个嘛...012---Well...
我想我要挑钱德勒012---I think I want to take Chandler.
菲比  菲比  菲比...012---Phoebe, Phoebe, Phoebe.
你想带我去吗012---You want to take me?
对  我希望能带大家一起去012---Yeah, I'm sorry. I wish I could take everybody.
但钱德勒一直都很支持我的工作012---But Chandler's always supported my career.
他帮我付表演课跟大头照等等的费用012---He's paid for acting classes, headshots and stuff.
这就是我回报你的方式012---This will be my way of paying you back.
所以你不打算还我钱了吗012---So you're never actually going to pay me back?
只因为他帮你付大头照的钱  你就要选他012---Just because he paid for your headshots, you're gonna take him?
你大概还没搞明白那件连衣裙有多露012---I don't think you're comprehending just how slutty this dress is.
不仅是因为他帮我付了钱012---It's not just the stuff he paid for.
他真的很支持我  你们知道吗012---It's everything, you know?
他跟我对台词012---He read lines with me.
我紧张的时候  他陪我去试镜012---He went with me on auditions when I was nervous.
我没拿到我想要的角色时  他会安慰我012---Then he consoled me after I didn't get parts that I really wanted.
你一直很相信我012---You always believed in me, man,
即使连我都不相信自己012---even when I didn't believe in myself.
我一直都知道你会成功012---I always knew you were gonna make it.
我非常以你为荣012---I'm so proud of you.
谢谢  那对我来说很重要012---Thanks, that means a lot to me.
莫妮卡  或许他们之中有人想穿你的连衣裙012---Mon, maybe one of these guys wants to wear your dress.
我得去刮胡子012---I'm gonna go shave.
对  我得去吐痰了012---Yeah, well, I'm gonna go spit.
我得去尿尿了012---I have to pee.
如果五分钟后我还没出来012---If I don't come out in five minutes,
那肯定是因为我被百花香味给熏死了012---it's because I've choked to death on the potpourri stink.
等她出来以后  你捏住她的鼻子012---When she comes out, you hold her nose,
我对她的嘴巴吹气  宝宝就会掉出来012---I'll blow in her mouth and the kid'll just... right out of her.
她都晚了一周了  今天她一定会生012---She's over a week late. She's got to have it today, right?
我不知道  我觉得应该还要一阵子012---I don't know. I think it's still gonna be a while.
你想加点刺激吗012---Care to make it interesting?
我跟你打赌  她明天这个时候就会生012---I bet you she'll have it by this time tomorrow.
没问题012---You're on.
好吧  赌多少  我跟你赌十万块012--- Okay, how much?  One hundred thousand dollars.
50块如何012---How about 50 bucks?
好吧  我会打电话让苏黎世银行汇点钱过来012---Fine, I'll call Zurich and move some money around.
好了  这次轮到谁来扶我起来了012---All right, whose turn is it to help me get up?
家里没人012---No one's here.
该死012---Oh, damn it!
这简直是太刺激  太迷人了012---This is so exciting. So glamorous!
好多人帮我们拍照  我看起来如何012---People taking our picture. How do I look?
太高了一点  什么012--- A little tall.  What?
你能不能蹲低一点  让我看起来高一点012---Would you crouch down a bit so that I look taller?
很好012---There you go.
简直太刺激了012---It's just so glamorous.
莫妮卡  瑞秋来了012---Oh, hey, Mon? Rach is here.
你还没生012---And you're still pregnant.
真对不起  我知道你很不舒服012---I'm sorry. I know how uncomfortable you are.
你知道吗  你看起来棒极了012---You know what? You look great.
就跟50块钞票一样012---Yeah, like 50 bucks.
我得去尿尿012---I have to go pee.
很明显  这个宝宝把我的膀腕当成玩具捏012---Apparently this baby thinks my bladder is a squeeze toy.
该死  50块拿去012---Damn it. Here's your 50 bucks.
你竟然会输  这真是太有趣了012---That's interesting that you lost.
我记不得了  你喜欢输吗012---Now, I forget, do you like to lose?
好吧  别说了012---All right, stop it.
我们加倍赌她明天会生  好  跟你赌012--- Double or nothing she has it by tomorrow.  Fine, you're on.
在那之前  葛兰特将军012---Until then, General Grant,
你就在这里安心扎营吧012---why don't you set up camp... right there?
瑞秋在这里吗  我们得去看医生012---Is Rachel here? We have a doctor's appointment.
她在厕所里012---She's in the bathroom.
瑞秋  我们得走了  马上好012--- Rach, we gotta go.  In a minute!
大家问我们为什么没在一起012---People ask me why we're not together.
我都不知道该怎么告诉他们012---I just don't know what to tell them.
好吧  我们走吧012---All right, all right, let's go.
你要不要先去换衣服012---Do you want to go change first?
医生会等我们  但如果你快一点的话...012---The doctor's staying open late for us, but if you hurry...
不用  我这样很好012---No, I'm fine.
你不觉穿这套衣服有点不合适吗012---You don't think that's a little inappropriate?
什么  天啊  别火上浇油了012--- What?  Good God, man. Don't anger it.
罗斯  现在外面有38度高温012---Ross, it is 100 degrees outside.
这是好几个星期以来我第一次...012---For the first time in weeks, I am...
好吧  随便你012---Fine. Whatever you want.
你是妈咪012---You're the mommy.
可别叫我"妈眯"012---No! Don't call me "Mommy."
你那么称呼你妈就已经够受了012---It's bad enough you call your own mother that.
这一次我同意她的说法012---I'm actually with her on this one.
我还以为自己知道敌人是谁  但敌人却是你012---I thought I knew who the enemy was, but it was you all along.
好了  我的打斗戏要开始了012---Okay, this is it. This is my big fight scene coming up.
我要为第82地面师的每位弟兄奋战012---I'm fighting for every man in the 82nd Ground Division.
罗斯  我能问你一件事吗012---Ross? Can I ask you something?
卡罗尔怀本的时候...012---When Carol was pregnant with Ben...
你有这么暴躁吗012---...were you this irritating?
你说什么  没事  你只是...012--- Excuse me?  Nothing. You're just...
你最近对我很不耐烦012---You've been a little short with me lately.
我无意惹毛你012---I'm not trying to irritate you.
那么你一定是有惹毛我的天份012---Well, then, you must have a natural talent for it.
医生马上就要过来了012---You know what? The doctor will be in soon.
我们在那之前还是别说话了吧012---Why don't we not speak until then?
好吧012---Okay.
呼吸声再大一点   罗斯  感觉真好012---Seriously. Breathe louder, Ross. That's great.
我们应该问医生她知不知道...012---We should ask the doctor if she even knows...
怎么接生半人半魔的孩子012---...how to deliver a baby that's half human, half pure evil!
朗医生  你好吗012---Hi, Dr. Long. How are you?
你对她倒很好012---You're nice to her.
她手上有药012---She has the drugs.
我帮你快速检查一下  好的012--- We'll do a quick check.  Okay.
已经迟了八天吗  对012--- So eight days late, huh?  Yeah.
你一定觉得很不舒服012---You must be getting a little uncomfortable.
对  只有一点012---Yeah, just a tad.
宫口已经扩张了八成  就快了012---You're 80% effaced. So you're on your way.
但你可能还得等上一阵子012---It still could last a while longer.
如果你很着急  有些方法可以促产012---If you're anxious, there are ways to help things along.
那就赶紧的吧012---Do them!
事实上你们可以自助012---Actually, they're things that you can do.
在家里做治疗012---Just some home remedies.
根据我的经验  我发现有些方法很有效012---In my experience, I've found some are very effective.
我们愿意尝试任何方法012---Well, we are ready to try anything.
好的  你可以喝一种药草茶012---Okay. There's an herbal tea you can drink.
你可以喝蓖麻子油  吃辣的食物012---You can take some castor oil. There's spicy foods.
我们全都愿意尝试012---Great. We will do all of those.
长时间散步  很好  没问题012--- Taking a long walk.  Good. Done.
据证实  最有效的方法就是做爱012---And there's the one that's proved most effective: Sex.
你一定是在开玩笑012---You've got to be kidding me!
演得好  乔伊  太棒了  超一流012---Good job, Joe! Well done! Topnotch!
你真的喜欢吗  当然喜欢012--- You liked it? You really liked it?  Oh, yeah!
你具体喜欢哪个部份012---Well, which part exactly?
整部电影  我们走吧012---The whole thing! Here we go!
不  说具体一点012---No, no, no. Give me some specifics.
我就喜欢具体细节  细节处理得最棒了012---I loved the specifics. The specifics were the best part.
有袋鼠出场的那场戏呢012---Hey, what about the scene with the kangaroo?
你喜欢吗012---Did you like that part?
看到一战的电影里出现袋鼠012---I was surprised to see a kangaroo
我吓了一大跳012---in a World War I epic.
你睡着了012---You fell asleep!
电影里面根本没有袋鼠012---There was no kangaroo!
我的建议他们一条都没采纳012---They didn't take any of my suggestions!
谢谢你来捧场  回头见012---Thanks a lot for coming. See you later.
别走  我很抱歉012---Don't go. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
看  这家伙睡着了012---Look, this guy fell asleep!
他也睡着了  生他的气啊012---He fell asleep too! Be mad at him!
或是叫救护车来012---Or call an ambulance!
医生说什么012---What did the doctor say?
知道宝宝何时会出生吗012---Any news on when the baby will come?
不知道  她教了我们一些促产的方法012---No. She gave us ideas on how to induce labor.
我们都试过了012---We tried them all.
我们去散了步  喝了茶012---We went for a walk, we tried special tea,
吃蓖麻子油跟辣的食物  全都没用012---castor oil, spicy food. Nothing has worked.
有个方法我们没试012---There is one thing we didn't try.
但某人觉得那会惹来大麻烦012---But someone thinks that that will open up a can of worms.
什么方法012---What is it? What is it?
如果有办法让宝宝今天就出生012---If it's gonna help bring the baby here, today...
我觉得你们应该试试看012---I mean, I think you should do it.
我们得做爱  那就做啊012--- It's sex.  Do it!
莫妮卡  你们很久没做爱了012--- Monica.  It's been a really long time for you.
我是说女人也有需要012---I mean, women have needs.
快去吧  满足你的需要012---Do it. Get yours.
这种事我可说不好012---Oh, I don't know about that.
我觉得如果你们两个做了爱012---I think if the two of you had sex,
那浮动诊胎法一定会出大问题012---the repercussions would be catastrophic.
好吧  我们实际一点012---All right, let's be practical.
如果罗斯不愿意012---If Ross isn't willing to do it,
这世上不只有他能跟你做爱012---he's not the only guy in the world you can have sex with.
你可以借用钱德勒  钱德勒很厉害012---You could borrow Chandler. Chandler is good.
莫妮卡  你这是怎么了012---Monica, what is the matter with you?
没什么  我只是希望宝宝能在今天出生012---Nothing. I just want the baby to be born today.
为什么一定要是今天012---Why? Why today?
好吧012---Okay, fine.
我一直在跟菲比打赌你会生012---I keep betting Phoebe that you're gonna have the baby,
我不想再输钱了012---and I don't want to lose again.
什么  她这么痛苦012---What? While she's been going through this hell,
你们却在赌钱012---you've been making money?
你们拿朋友持续经受痛苦来当赌注012---You're betting on your friend staying in this misery?
我也要赌  什么012--- I'll take that bet.  What?
我已经够惨了  还不如找点钱赚012---I'm miserable here. I may as well make some money out of it.
我也可以加入吗012---Can I get some of that action?
等等  现在变成我跟你们三个对赌012---Wait a minute. I'm betting against all of you?
别担心  我真的觉得明天就要生了012---Don't worry. I really do feel like tomorrow it's gonna happen.
好吧012---Okay.
嘿  睡美人012---Hey, Sleeping Beauty.
你跑到哪里去了  打电话都不接012---Where have you been? I try to call you.
我想跟你谈谈  我还是觉得很过意不去012---I want to talk to you. I still feel bad.
不是吧  你不开心了吗  睡不着觉了吗012---Oh, no. Were you upset? Did you lose sleep?
我很抱歉012---I'm so sorry.
我之所以过来解决我们之间的问题012---The reason I came over is to settle things between us.
是因为你帮了我很多忙012---You've done a lot for me in my career.
我想请你去看首映会来报答你012---I wanted to pay you back by taking you to the premiere,
但你却睡着了012---but you missed it.
我欠你多少钱  什么012--- So how much do I owe you?  What?
给我个数字  我不想欠你012---Give me a number. I don't want to owe you anything.
你什么都不欠我012---You don't owe me anything.
我不要你的...  说还就还012--- I don't want your...  We're doing this!
你帮我付第一次大头照的费用多少钱012---You got me my first headshots. How much were those?
我不知道  五百块012---I don't know, $500.
好吧  五百块  还有呢012---Okay, $500. What else?
还有第二组大头照012---Then there was the second set.
恶评如潮的"鼻涕虫"大头照012---The infamous "booger" headshots.
好吧  再加五百块012---Okay, so that's another $500.
五百加五百是...012---That's 500 and 500. That's...
你需要计算器吗  谢谢012--- You want a calculator?  Please.
拿去012---Here.
好吧  还有呢012---All right, what else?
还有表演课  舞台打斗课  踢踏舞课012---Well, there's acting classes, stagecombat classes, tap classes...
这些天知地知  你知我知就好012---Which we're still keeping under our hats.
我还付钱请教练012---Then there was that dialect coach who helped you with that play
教你说南方腔012---where you needed a southern accent.
上了20小时的课后  你还是满口牙买加腔012---Which, after 20 hours of lessons, still came out Jamaican.
你在胡说什么012---What the hell are you talking about?
"南方将会再起  兄弟"012---The South will rise again, man.
对  那笔钱花得很值得012---Yes, money wellspent.
好吧  还有呢  房租012---Okay, what else? Rent.
两三年的房租  水电费  伙食费012---Okay. Two, three years of rent, utilities, food...
好吧 我写张支票给你012---Okay, so I'm writing you a check for...
你不就是看我电影的时候睡着了嘛012---So you fell asleep during my movie.
没什么大不了的  对吧012---Big deal, right?
这玩意要怎么清除012---How do you clear this thing?
把你的墨西哥卷吃掉012---Come on. Finish your enchilada.
罗斯  我们试过所有的辛辣食品  根本没用012---Ross, we've tried all the spicy food. It's not working.
好吧  拿去  吃根辣椒012---Okay, here, have one of these peppers.
天啊  好辣  我的天啊012---Oh, God. So hot. Oh, my God.
对了  拿过辣椒之后012---By the way, you don't want to touch the pepper
别用手摸眼睛012---and then touch your eye.
我什么感觉都没有012---I am feeling nothing.
说到辣  看到你现在的样子012---Speaking of hot, watching you do that...
让我很想跟你做爱012---...really makes me want to have sex with you.
别闹了012---Stop it.
来嘛  罗斯  我们为什么要浪费时间012---Come on, Ross! Why are we wasting time with all this other stuff?
明知道这招很管用012---We know it's gonna work.
这是医生的建议012---It's doctorrecommended.
抱歉  但我们总该有点分寸012---I'm sorry. But we have to have some boundaries.
天啊  我快辣死了012---My God, I'm dying.
来嘛  罗斯012---Come on, Ross.
我们以前都做过  再做一次又怎样012---We've done it before. We'll do it again.
这也算是给我的怀孕期画上圆满句号了012---It'll be a nice way to bookend the pregnancy.
