我要在脑海中拍张照012---I must take a mental picture!
抱歉012---Sorry.
你们在取笑派克吗012---Were you guys making fun of Parker?
那得看你听到了多少012---That depends, how much did you hear?
他是有点狂热  可那有什么不对012---He's a little enthusiastic. What's wrong with that?
他太过火了  那又怎么样  我喜欢他012--- It's so much.  Well, so what? I like him.
我会取笑你们的约会对象吗012---Do I make fun of the people you've dated?
泰格  珍妮丝  蒙娜012---Tag, Janice, Mona.
不  因为朋友不会那么做012---No, because friends don't do that.
你们想知道我的想法吗012---But do you want my opinion?
依我看来012---Do you want it? 'Cause in my opinion,
你们的约会纪录加起来012---your collective dating record
基本等同于人渣史012---reads like a who's who of human crap!
我觉得好内疚  我知道012--- I feel terrible.  I know.
蒙娜有哪里不好012---What was wrong with Mona?
快打开  好耶  宝贝012--- Open it, open it, open it.  Yeah, baby!

你不吃的话我绝不罢休  好吧012--- I won't quit until you try one.  Okay, fine, fine.
很棒012---Good.

如果你需要的话  我可以按住他们  让你012---If you want to, I could just hold them down and you could just...
我戴着蕾丝婚纱  由比利时盲人修女织成012---And my veil was lace, made by blind Belgian nuns.
盲人012---Blind?

她走进来012---She walked in
我在房间里铺满了她最喜欢的百合花012---and I had the room filled with lilies, her favorite flower.

音响系统里传出弗莱德·艾斯塔的歌声012---Then Fred Astaire singing, "The Way You Look Tonight"
《你今晚的样子》  此时灯光熄灭012---came on the sound system, and the lights came down,
我单脚跪地012---I got on one knee...
圆顶从左至右用星星拼成一行字012---and written across the dome, in the stars, were the words:
"你愿意嫁给我吗 "012---"Will you marry me?"
戒指有我的拳头那么大012---And the ring was the size of my fist.
菲比  听着012---Hey, Phoebe? Look...
我要对你道歉  我们太不厚道了012---...I want to apologize about before. Okay? We were being jerks.
派克人很好  我想多了解他012---Parker's a nice guy, and I'd like to get to know him.
那你最好快去找他012---Then you better do it now.
为什么  因为我要杀了他012--- Why?  Because I'm gonna kill him.
什么  你们说得没错012--- What? What?  You guys were right.
他对所有事都太热衷了012---He's too excited about everything.
我也很喜欢生命012---I'm all for living life,
但这是盖勒夫妇结婚35周年派对012---but this is the Gellers' 35th anniversary.
我们摸着良心说话  这个派对烂透了012---Let's call a spade a spade. This party stinks.
就是  我简直无聊到了极点012---I know. I'm having the worst time.
那边取自助餐要排15分钟的队012---There was a 15minute line for the buffet,
等我好不容易拿到盘子012---and when I got to the plates...
结果踩到一大坨鼻涕滑倒了012---...I slipped on a giant booger.
你确定那不是生蚝吗012---Are you sure it wasn't an oyster?
有可能  我没看012---It could've been. I didn't look at it.
我把它抹在钱德勒的外套上  拔腿就溜012---I just wiped it on Chandler's coat and got the hell out.
我还以为他是个好人  我对他真的很期待012---I thought he was a great guy. I was so excited about him.
嘿  你应该对他充满期待012---Well, hey, you should be excited about him.
他没有什么不对  他是个好人012---There's nothing wrong with him. He's a good guy.
真的吗  对  你知道吗012--- You think?  Yeah, you know what I think?
我们都太悲观了  你说得对012--- I think we were all just being too negative.  You're right.
他只是在拥抱生命而已012---You're right. He's just embracing life.
我们都应该向派克学习012---We could all stand to be a little more like Parker.
你知道吗  我就跟他一样012---You know what? I'm like him!
我是个积极乐观的人012---I'm a sunny, positive person!
事实上  你现在稍微有点激动了012---Actually, you have a little bit of an edge.
你小子说什么012---What's that now?

跟着音乐学动物跳舞  来吧012---People acting like animals to music? Come on!
好吧  该致词了012---Okay, it's time for the toast.
我知道往年一向都是由罗斯来致词012---I know that normally Ross gives the toast,
但今年由我来012---but this year I'm gonna do it.
别这样  内容会很精彩012---No, it's gonna be great. Really.
好的012---Okay.
妈  爸  我结婚时012---Mom, Dad, when I got married...
令我对婚姻充满信心的原因之一012---...one of the things that made me sure that I could do it
就是你们这对模范夫妻为我做出的表率012---was the amazing example the two of you set for me.
为了那一点及其他种种  我要感谢你们012---For that, and for so many other things, I want to thank you.
这句话我或许不常说  但...012---I know I probably don't say it enough, but...
我爱你们012---I love you.
我环顾四周012---When I look around this room,
想起那些无法出席的人  便心生悲伤012---I'm saddened by the thought of those who could not be with us.
我亲爱的外婆012---Nana, my beloved grandmother,
她肯定很想来012---who would so want to be here.
但她来不了...012---But she can't...
因为她死了012---...because she's dead.
我们的狗琪琪也是一样012---As is our dog, ChiChi.

谢谢莫妮卡  那段致辞很有意思012---Thank you, Monica. That was interesting.
很有意思吧  杰克012---Wasn't it interesting, Jack?
为什么我不记得这只狗了012---Why don't I remember this dog?
罗斯  你为什么不为我们致词呢012---Ross? Why don't you give us your toast now?
不  妈  今年只有莫妮卡致辞012---Oh, no, Mom. It's just Monica this year.

你都不打算不致词吗012---On our 35th wedding anniversary?
当然不是012---No, of course.
