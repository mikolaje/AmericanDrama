乔伊  你在吗012---Joey? Are you in there?
是瑞秋  乔伊  你得跟她谈一谈012--- That's Rachel.  Joey, you have to talk to her.
不行  经过那晚的事之后012---No. I can't. I can't. Not after the other night.
感觉太奇怪了012---It's too weird, okay?
别告诉她我在这里012---Don't tell her I'm here.
别吃那个012---Don't eat that!
瑞秋  乔伊在吗012--- Hey, Rachel.  Is Joey here?
我没有看到他  你呢  没有012--- I don't see him. Do you see him?  I don't see him.
或许他在糖碗里  乔伊  没人012---Maybe he's in the sugar bowl. Joey? Nope.
至少你们能彼此逗乐012---Well, at least you make each other laugh.
怎么了  自从他那晚跟我坦白之后012--- What's up?  I haven't seen him since that night
我就一直没见过他012---that he told me how he, you know...
我觉得他在躲我012---I don't know, I think he's avoiding me.
为什么地板上会有百吉饼012---Why is that bagel on the floor?
我们在玩游戏  钱德勒脱了衣服玩的吗012--- We were playing a game. Was Chandler naked?
像是套圈圈之类的游戏吗012---Sort of like a ringtoss kind of situation?
没错  什么  不是012--- Sure!  What? No! No!
好吧  如果你们看到乔伊012---All right, listen. If you see Joey,
能不能告诉他...012---will you just tell him that...?
告诉他我很想他012---Tell him I miss him.
好吧  你听到了吗012---Okay. Did you hear that?
是啊  裸体百吉饼游戏012---Yeah. That naked bagel game?
我很怀疑  这个洞很小的012---Dude, I don't know. That's a pretty small hole.
你得跟她谈一谈  我做不到012--- Honey, you've gotta talk to her.  I can't.
你们不知道真情告白之后012---You guys don't know what it's like
却被拒绝的感觉有多难受012---to put yourself out there like that and just get shot down.
我不知道那种感觉012---I don't know what that's like?
我在25岁前一直以为012---Until I was 25, I thought the response
对"我爱你"的回应是"真糟糕"012---to "I love you" was "Oh, crap."
我没有被拒绝过012---No rejection?
我连在减肥营都被拒绝过012---I got shot down at fat camp.
天啊  饿肚子的孩子可真恶毒012---Boy, kids are mean when they're hungry.
我该怎么办012---So, what do I do?
她是瑞秋  难道你永远都不跟她说话了吗012---This Rachel. You're gonna never talk to her again?
那很奇怪  也很尴尬  但至少你得试试看012---I know it's weird and it's awkward, but you gotta at least try.
好吧012---Yeah, okay.
我忘了这个曾套在你的...012---I almost forgot this was on your...
我们根本就没玩012---We didn't play it!
《老友记》  第八季  第17集  茶叶012---Friends S08E17 The One With The Tea Leaves
等你们喝完茶之后012---Okay, so when you're done with your tea,
我可以看茶叶帮你们算命012---I'll look at the leaves and tell your fortune.
你会茶叶算命法吗  我做过好几年了012--- You didn't know read tea leaves?  I've done it for years.
我后来放弃是因为我算得太难了012---I actually stopped because I was so accurate.
生命最大的乐趣之一012---And one of the great joys of life...
就在于其神奇的不可预测性012---...is its wondrous unpredictability, you know?
而且我喝茶会拉肚子012---And also, tea tends to give me the trots.
我喝完了  帮我算吧  好的012--- Okay. I'm done. Read mine.  Okay.
我看到一个梯子012---I see a ladder.
代表的要么是升职  要么是暴力性死亡012---Which can mean either a promotion or a violent death.
我是主厨  不可能再升职了012---I'm the head chef. I can't get promoted.
下一个是谁012---Who's next?
我喝完了  帮我算  好吧012--- Okay. I'm done. Do mine.  Okay.
好吧  我看到一个圈圈012---Oh! Okay, I see a circle.
那表示你要么怀了孩子012---Which can either mean you're having a baby...
要么会做出科学发现012---...or you'll make a scientific discovery!
我确实经常在实验室待着012---Well, I have been spending a lot of time in the lab.
你的茶叶又预示着什么呢  菲比012---What does yours say, Pheebs?
好吧012---All right.
我会认识一个男人  而且很快012---Oh, I'm gonna meet a guy! And really soon!
他会是我的梦中情人012---He's gonna be the man of my dreams.
或许不是我昨晚梦到的那个男人012---Probably not the guy I had a dream about last night.
有人看到我的衬衫吗012---Has anyone seen my shirt?
是前开式的淡鲑鱼色衬衫012---It's a buttondown, like a faded salmon color?
你是说那件粉红色衬衫吗012---You mean your pink shirt?
淡鲑鱼色012---Faded salmon color?
不  我没看到你的粉红色衬衫012---No, I haven't seen your pink shirt.
我一定把它落在蒙娜家了  我就知道012---Great. I must have left it at Mona's. I knew it!
你可以到安·泰勒的专卖店再买一件012---I'm sure you can get another one at Ann Taylor's.
那是我最爱的衬衫  我超喜欢012---That's my favorite shirt. I love that shirt.
那就让蒙娜还给你啊012---Just ask Mona to give it back.
我不知道  或许可以吧012---I don't know. I guess could.
只是我们最后闹得不太愉快012---It's just we didn't really end things on such good terms.
如果我去她家012---And if I went over there,
就等于无视她分手时对我提出的唯一要求012---I'd be ignoring the one thing she asked me to do when we broke up.
她要我去跳楼自杀012---Jump up my own ass and die.
等一下012---Oh, wait a second, you guys?
这几周以来012---For the last couple weeks,
我走到哪里都会看到那个男人012---I've been seeing that guy everywhere I go.
我们搭同一班公车  去同一家书店012---We take the same bus, we go to the same bookstore,
同一家干洗店  或许他就是我的真命天子012---and the same dry cleaners. Maybe he's the tea guy.
菲比  你们看到了吗012---Phoebe, did you see that?
他绝对是在打量你  而且他超帅的012---He totally checked you out! And he is so cute!
我的茶叶像是乡巴佬  那是什么意思012---Mine is a picture of the Village People. What does that mean?
菲比喝茶会拉肚子012---Tea gives Phoebe the trots!
我以为乔伊跟我待在一起就不会尴尬了012---I thought Joey and I would be okay once we hung out,
但现在我们都不知道该怎么相处012---but it's like we don't even know how to be with each other any more.
虽说你们现在很难相处  但情况会改善的012---I konw, it's tough now, but things will get better.
你怎么知道012---How do you know that?
如果情况不断恶化...012---What if it gets worse and worse and worse,
我们都无法共处一室了该怎么办呢012---to the point where we can't be in the same room with each other?
我不善于给人提建议012---I'm not great at the advice.
我能讽刺你一番吗012---Can I interest you in a sarcastic comment?
要奶酪吗012---Some cheese?
老公  为什么布鲁斯·史普林斯汀的CD012---Honey, why is the Bruce Springsteen CD
会放在凯特·史帝文斯的盒子里012---in the Cat Stevens case?
如果我找不到正确的盒子012---Let's just say if I can't find the right CD case,
我就会随手拿个盒子来装012---I just put it in the nearest one.
那凯特·史帝文斯的CD在哪里012---Okay. Where is the Cat Stevens CD?
在詹姆士·泰勒的盒子里012---In the James Taylor case.
那张CD在哪里  我帮你节省些时间吧012--- Where is James Taylor CD?  Honey, I'll save you some time.
那200张CD没有一张是放在正确盒子里的012---Two hundred CDs, not one of them in the right case.
好吧  不需要慌张  大家深呼吸012---Okay. No need to panic. Deep breaths, everyone.
我们只需要花些时间012---Okay, we're just gonna have to spend some time
把CD放在正确的盒子里012---and put the CDs in the right cases.
如果要整理的话  那就应该按某种顺序排好012---If we do that, we should come up with some kind of order.
按字母顺序或音乐风格012---You know, alphabetically or by genre?
我不知道  这件事我们得好好商量012---I don't know. We have to talk this through.
天啊  你们有什么毛病啊012---Oh, my God, you guys have such problems!
我真为你们感到难过012---I feel so terrible for you!
好吧  对不起012---All right. Okay, I'm sorry.
你和乔伊两个人满脑子012---Look, you and Joey, you're both focusing
都是这件烦人的事012---on this uncomfortable thing.
你们需要改变一下话题012---What you need to do is to change the subject.
下次见面  跟他谈谈别的事情012---Next time you see him try to get him talking about something else.
对  那挺有道理的012---Yeah, that makes sense.
或许你在工作上有问题012---Yeah. I don't know, maybe you have a work problem
需要他的建议...012---that you need his advice on.
我可以用这招  很好012--- I could do that.  Good.
你连迈阿密天龙的原声带都有吗012---Honey, the Miami Vice soundtrack? Really?
那只是唱片行的赠品012---They were just giving those away at the store.
我得拿钱去换012---In exchange for money.
我真的不知道该给你什么建议  瑞秋012---I really don't know what to tell you, Rach, I really don't.
或许乔伊可以帮你解决工作上的这个大问题012---Maybe Joey could help you out with your big work problem.
什么  对  乔伊  她...012--- What?  Yeah, Joey, she's...
瑞秋工作上碰到一个大问题012---Rachel's got this big work problem.
真的很伤脑筋012---It is a headscratcher.
我们想赶上晚餐预约012---You know what? If we're gonna make dinner,
就得马上出发了012---we're gonna have to leave.
你工作上出了大问题012---So you have a big work problem?
对  那是...012---Yeah. It's, uh...
对  那是...012---Yeah, it's, uh...
真的没什么012---You know, it's nothing.
好吧012---Okay.
我想我该走了012---So I think I'm gonna take off.
不  乔伊  等等  我确实有问题012---No, wait, Joey, it is. It's something. It's...
是我的老板012---It's my boss.
是吗  对  跟...012--- Yeah?  Yeah. And, uh...
跟我的宝宝012---And my baby.
是吗012---Yeah?
我老板想买我的宝宝012---My boss wants to buy my baby.
什么  我的天啊012---What? Oh, my God!
我跟你说过了  这真的是个大问题012---I know, I told you, it's a really big problem!
他要买你的宝宝  你能相信吗012--- He wants to buy your baby?  Can you believe that?
那太疯狂了  我就是那么跟他说的012--- That's crazy.  That's what I told him!
怎么会发生这种事  我会告诉你的012--- How did this even happen?  Well, I'll tell you.
我老板跟他太太  他们不孕  所以...012---See, my boss and his wife, they can't have children, so...
我们在圣诞派对上碰了面...012---And then when we were at the Christmas party...
他喝醉了  跟我说012---...he got drunk and said to me,
"瑞秋  我要买下你的宝宝"012---"Rachel, I want to buy your baby."
天啊012---Man!
你说问题出在老板跟宝宝身上的时候...012---When you said it was a problem about your boss and the baby...
我以为你是指产假的问题012---...I figured it was about maternity leave.
对啊012---Yeah.
对  那样子问题就简单多了012---Yeah, that would have been a much simpler problem.
你好  是你  我走到哪里都会碰到你012--- Oh, hello.  Oh, it's you. I see you everywhere.
我是吉米  吉米·尼尔森012---I'm Jim. Jim Nelson.

我们也能碰面  八点可以吗012---at dinner tomorrow night, say around 8 o'clock?
我们或许会碰面吧012---Well, maybe we will.
蒙娜012---Mona?
如果我是件鲑鱼色衬衫  我会在哪里呢012---Okay, if I were a salmon shirt, where would I be?
抱歉  我把酒洒到你的衬衫上了012---I am so sorry I spilled wine all over your shirt.
没关系  不  还是湿的012--- It's okay.  No, it's still wet.
我拿去洗干净  免得留下印子012---Let me get it out before it sets.
我这里有件衣服你可以穿012---I have something you could wear.
拿去吧012---Here.
我真的不想穿女式衬衫012---I don't know if I want to wear a woman's shirt.
那是男式衬衫  可怕的粉红色012--- No, no, that's a man's shirt.  Awfully pink.
那不是粉红色012---It's not pink!
天啊  老婆  我们注定要在一起012---Oh, my god. Honey, we are so meant to be together.
我们都有安妮的原声带012---Look, we both have the copies of Annie soundtrack.
老公  两张都是你买的012---Honey, both yours.
谢谢你给我关于乔伊的建议012---Hey, great advice on that Joey thing.
工作的问题吗012---Yeah? The work problem?
感觉太棒了012---It was perfect.
我又在他身上找回了朋友的感觉012---It really felt like he was my friend again.
你说你遇到了什么问题012---What problem did you say you have?
那不重要012---Oh, that's not important.
重点是我觉得一切都会没事012---The point is, I really... I think everything's gonna be okay.
需要我效劳吗012---May I help you?
你觉得你可以随便买走我朋友的宝宝吗012---You think you can just buy my friend's baby?
我们一直巧遇  真是有缘啊012---Isn't it funny how we kept running into each other?
就像是有人想把我们撮合到一起012---It's as if someone really wants us to be together.
没错  那就是我012---Someone does. Me.
聪明的家伙  做得好012---Witty banter. Well done.
不错  跟我谈谈你自己012--- Good.  So tell me a little bit about yourself.

对  我猜是有一点012---Yeah, I guess. A little.
那没有什么  我也很狂野012---Ain't no thing. I'm wild too.
总之...012---So anyway...
我住在纽约  生活方式有点狂野012---...I've lived in New York, somewhat wildly, I guess...
我从14岁就住在这里012---...for, well, since I was 14.
抱歉我盯着你不放012---I'm sorry. I'm staring.
因为你有双非常漂亮的眼睛012---It's just that you have the most beautiful eyes.
别说了  还有你的胸部012--- Oh, stop it.  And your breasts!
好吧012---Okay.
听着  你的攻势有点太猛了012---Look, you're coming on a little strong.
但我暂且认为你没有恶意012---I'll give you the benefit of the doubt.
因为宇宙中有股力量将我们牵引到一起012---Because since the universe really wants us to be together.
我们为何不重新来过呢012---So why don't we start over?
你可以跟我谈谈你自己012---You can tell me about yourself.

陪我聊我老板的问题  那对我来说意义重大012---about that thing with my boss. That really means a lot.
别客气  我得告诉你012---Not a problem. Just so you know...
那家伙不会再为了宝宝的事来烦你了012---...that guy won't be bothering you about that baby thing anymore.
什么  就说我已经帮你解决了012--- What?  Let's just say I took care of it.
我们得谈一谈012---Let's say more.
别担心  我平心静气地跟他谈过012---Don't worry. Don't worry. I just told him, very nicely:
"你不能随便买别人的宝宝  放弃吧"012---"You don't go buying people's babies! So back off!"
什么  什么012--- What?  What?
不要啊012---No, no, no!
乔伊  他不想买我的宝宝  那是我编出来的012---Joey, he doesn't want to buy my baby! I made that up!
什么  为什么012---What? Why?
那样我们才有话题可聊嘛012---So we would have something to talk about!
才不会显得尴尬012---So it wouldn't be awkward!
你想不出来别的借口吗012---And you couldn't think of anything else?
你说你老板要买你的宝宝012---You said your boss wants to buy your baby?
真不敢相信你对我老板大叫012---I can't believe you yelled at my boss!
我会被开除  我该怎么办012---I'll lose my job! What am I gonna do?
你可以卖掉你的宝宝012---You could always sell your baby.
我不敢相信你会去找我老板012---Joey, I can't believe you brought my boss into this!
我会被开除的012---I'll be fired!

作为我们谈话的见证人012---as a witness to our conversation.
天啊012---Oh, God.
如果我有暗示过你012---If I in any way

上星期我问你  你的预产期是什么时候012---Last week, when I asked you when your due date was...
我并没有暗示你012---...I certainly did not mean that
我想"买"你的宝宝012---I felt that I was "due" your baby.
我希望清楚地告诉你...012---I want to be very clear...
我了解  那是你的宝宝012---...that I understand that it's your baby...
我不能买下它012---...and it is not mine to purchase.
只要把话说清楚就好了012---Well, as long as we are clear about that.
到了012---There it is.
这不是你常去的洗衣店  我知道012--- That's not your regular cleaners.  I know.
但和我约会的那个怪胎会去那里012---but that creep that I went on that date with goes to there,
我得找家新的洗衣店012---so I have to find a new one.
我还得找新的音像店012---I also have to find a new video store,
银行  成人书店  杂货店...012---a new bank, a new adult bookstore, a new grocery store...

宇宙预示我会认识一个好男人012---The universe said I'd meet a nice guy.
结果就给我这么一个货色012---And that's what they gave me?
我上天堂后  一定要痛扁某人012---When I get up there, I'm gonna kick some ass.
别着急  菲比  你会遇到梦中情人的012---Don't worry Phoebe, You'll meet someone.
如果我能找到好男人  你也可以012---If I can meet a great guy, so can you.

这里是给衣物去污的地方012---This is where they get out stains.
对我来说这就像是迪士尼乐园012---This is like Disneyland for me.
我要到这里欣赏干净的衬衫跳舞012---I'm gonna be over here watching the dance of the clean shirts.
对不起  你掉了...012---Excuse me. I think you dropped...
哇  怎么了012--- Wow!  What?
抱歉  你真的是美得不可思议012---I'm sorry. It's just that you're so incredibly beautiful.
我也这么觉得  但又能怎么办呢012---Well, I'm sorry about that too. But what are you gonna do?
希望你别觉得我疯了012---I hope you don't think I'm crazy,
我觉得帮你捡东西算是命中注定012---but I feel like I was meant to pick this up,
你相信那种事吗  有一点012--- Do you believe in that kind of thing?  A little.
你终于靠谱了012---Now you're talking.
你想去喝杯咖啡吗012---Would you like to go out and have a cup of coffee?

她一定是先走了012---She must have left.
所以呢  发生了什么事  没事了012--- So? What happened?  It's all gonna be okay.
他们很高兴我不会告他们012---They're so happy I'm not suing them,
我还能多放一个月的带薪产假012---that they gave me one extra month paid maternity leave.
只要我明白那些薪水012---So long as I understand the money
并不是购买这个宝宝012---should not be construed as a down payment
或其他宝宝的订金012---on this or any other child that I may bear.
拉夫罗兰真的想尽办法...012---Ralph Lauren is going out of their way
