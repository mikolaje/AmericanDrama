菲比  明晚我要跟我爸一起吃饭012---Hey, Pheebs. I'm having dinner with my dad tomorrow night.
你要来吗012---Do you wanna come?
好啊  他挺性感的012---Sure, yeah. He's kind of sexy.
不  我也会去012---Oh, no, I'll be there too.
行  那么我们得想个暗号012---Okay. So we'll come up with some kind of signal.
如果一切进行顺利  你可以离开012---If it's going well, you can take off.
不  我是要你过去陪我012---No, I just need you there for support.
我还没有告诉他我怀孕了012---I haven't told him that I'm pregnant yet.
为什么012---Oh. Why not?
因为我知道他会气炸了012---Because I know he's gonna flip out,
我讨厌他生气的样子012---and I hate it when he's angry.
瑞秋  这跟《爸爸别说教》如出一辙012---Rachel, this is all so "Papa Don't Preach." 
不  菲比  等一下  他非常严厉012---No, Phoebe, wait. He's a scary guy.
有次他抓到我抽烟012---I mean, one time he caught me smoking.
他说如果他再看到我抽烟012---He said if he ever saw me doing that again,
他就逼我把一整包烟吃掉012---he'd make me eat the entire pack.
那我一定得去012---Wow. Well, I will be there.
天啊  我不会让那个男人逼你把宝宝吃掉012---Gosh, I'm not gonna let that man make you eat your baby!
那个家伙是谁  我想我认识他012---Hey, who is that guy? I think I know him.
才怪  你怎么会认识012--- No, you don't.  No, you don't.
天啊012---Oh, my God!
莫妮卡  他是你单身女郎派对上的脱衣舞男012---Monica, he's the stripper from your bachelorette party!
什么012---Her what?
你的秘密单身女郎派对012---Your secret bachelorette party.
你办了单身女郎派对012---You had a bachelorette party?
她用牙解开了他的丁字裤012---She untied his Gstring with her teeth.
谁快让我住嘴012---Somebody stop me!
我们不是说好不办单身汉或单身女郎派对吗012---I thought we weren't having bachelor, bachelorette parties.
我们都觉得这个传统很愚蠢012---We agreed that it's a silly tradition.
那个传统棒极了012---It's a grand tradition!
抱歉  她们给了我一个大惊喜012---I'm sorry. They surprised me.
我真的没有办法012---There was nothing I could do.
你可以用手解嘛012---Well, you could've untied it with your hands.
这太不公平了012---This is so unfair.
我非常想帮我最好的朋友办单身汉派对012---The one thing I wanted was to throw my best friend a bachelor party...
却不能那么做012---...but I wasn't allowed to.
我们只能一起去吃牛排012---All we got was a stupid steak dinner.
女服务生跟你回家睡了012---You went home with the waitress.
对  那一晚真的很美妙012---Yeah, that was a pretty good night.
我不敢相信你没有告诉我012---I can't believe you didn't tell me.
你知道婚姻的两大支柱012---You know that the two pillars of marriage
是公开跟诚实012---are openness and honesty.
我就知道送你那本书012---I knew giving you that book
总有一天我自己会遭报应012---was gonna come back and bite me in the ass.
《老友记》  第八季  第8集  脱衣舞娘012---Friends S08E08 The One With The Stripper
我帮大家点摩洛哥鸡肉怎么样012---How about I order everyone the Moroccan chicken?
我不吃肉012---Oh, I don't eat meat.
那是鸡肉012---It's chicken!
那个我也不吃012---I don't eat that either.
我一直都搞不懂你们女同志012---I never understand you lesbians.
宝贝  告诉我  你最近怎么样012---So, baby, tell me, what's new with you?
事实上...012---Well, actually...
您的74年拉费红酒  先生012---Your '74 Lafite, sir.
74年012---'74?
我点的是75年的  那一年的酒味道醇美012---I ordered the '75. That's a magnificent wine.
74年的酒烂透了012---The '74 is sewage!
你为什么要给我上那么烂的酒012---Why would you bring me sewage?
这个问题很难吗012---Is that a hard question?
你是白痴吗  所以你才会来当服务生012---Are you an idiot? Is that why you're a waiter?
这就是我告诉经理今晚不想为你服务的原因012---This is why I told the manager i wouldn't wait on you tonight.
少来了  别那么幼稚012---Oh, come on. Don't be such a baby.
你应该注意到了他真的很吓人012---In case you didn't notice, that is a scary man.
但他说得对  74年的酒真的很难喝012---He's right, though. The '74 is absolute piss.
这是个天大的错误  菲比012---This was such a huge mistake.
我不敢告诉他  菲比  我做不到012---I can't tell him, Phoebe. I can't. I can't. I can't.
瑞秋...  没事  这样吧012--- Rachel...  No, it's okay. This is what's gonna happen.
我再等上几年012---I'm gonna wait a couple of years,
然后宝宝会告诉他012---and then the baby will tell him.
怎么  让他拿宝宝撒气吗012---Why? So he can get mad at the baby?
那就是宝宝要解决的问题了012---Hey, that is the baby's problem.
服务生没问题吧012---Everything okay with the waiter?
我不知道  我去了洗手间012---I have no idea. I went to the bathroom.
甜心  你刚才准备告诉我你的近况012---So, sweetie, you were starting to tell me what is new with you.
我有了012---I got TiVo.
什么是有了  就是怀孕的意思012--- What's TiVo?  It's slang for "pregnant."
菲比012---Phoebe.
你真的怀孕了吗012---Are you really pregnant?
对也不对012---Well, yes and no.
但"不对"是不对的答案012---Except, not no.
总而言之  对012---So to sum it up, yeah.
孩子的爸爸是谁012---Who is the father?
不  拜托  别告诉就是她012---Oh, no. Please don't tell me it's her.
不  是罗斯  你喜欢罗斯012---No, it's Ross. It's Ross. You like Ross.
爸爸  我希望你能接受这件事012---Daddy, I hope you're okay with all of this.
想一想  这是件好事012---Think about it. This is a good thing.
这是你第一个外孙012---This is your first grandchild!
你要当外公了012---You're gonna be a poppy!
没错  我要当外公了012---That's true. I'm a poppy!
我要当外公了012---I'm gonna be a poppy!
婚礼什么时候举行  谁的婚礼012--- So when is the wedding?  The who?
婚礼  你们得举行婚礼012---The wedding. There's going to be a wedding.
小姑娘  你休想坐在那里告诉我012---Young lady, don't you sit there and tell me
我的第一个外孙会是个私生子012---my first grandchild is gonna be a bastard!
瑞秋·凯伦·格林  告诉我你们会举行婚礼012---Rachel Karen Green, tell me there is gonna be a wedding!
二月二日举行012---February 2nd!
今天去看你上课感觉很棒012---It was really cool seeing you lecture today.
谢谢  虽然我觉得你看起来012---Thanks. Although it kind of seemed like
像是睡着了012---you were falling asleep there a little.
不  我闭上眼睛012---No, no, I had my eyes closed
是为了专心听讲  好好消化吸收012---so I could concentrate and, you know, take it all in.
我很多学生都会那么做012---Yeah, a lot of my students do that.
我得走了  今晚见012--- I've got to get going.  Okay, I'll see you tonight?
好  再见012--- Yeah, okay.  Bye.
谢谢你让我参观你收集的半宝石012---Thanks for showing me your semipreciousstone collection.
真的很棒012---It's amazing.
天啊  你的床上功夫一定很厉害012---My God, you must be good in bed.
你跟蒙娜交往了一阵子  情况如何012---So you and Mona, it's been a while now. How's it going?
很不错012---It's good. It's going good.
我们处得很好  她很...012---I mean, we get along great. She's so...
辣  我本来说很温柔  但你答对了012--- Hot?  I was gonna say sweet, but yeah!
她能接受瑞秋和宝宝的事吗012---She's okay with Rachel and the baby?
我还没有告诉她012---I haven't actually told her yet.
我不想吓跑她012---I don't wanna scare her off, you know?
你得老实说012---You have to be honest with her.
不然的话  你以为你们的方向一致012---Otherwise, you may think you're going down the same path...
事实上你们走上了不同的道路012---...but you're really going down different ones.
我要把那本书抢过来  拿它把你打死012---I'm gonna take that book and I'm gonna beat you to death with it.
天啊  你一定会爱死我的012---Oh, my God, you are gonna love me so much.
关于单身女郎派对的事  我真的很过意不去012---I felt bad about the bachelorette party thing...
所以今晚你要办单身汉派对012---...so tonight you're gonna have a bachelor party.
什么012---What?
我在餐厅的同事给了我一个电话号码012---I got this number from this guy at work
我雇了一个脱衣舞娘来跳舞给你看012---and I hired a stripper to come dance for you.
我可以进太太名人堂了吧012---Am I going in the wife hall of fame or what?
亲爱的  这太疯狂了  我不要脱衣舞娘012---Honey, that's crazy. I don't want a stripper.
你能让她说完吗012---Will you let the lady talk?
来吧  一定会很好玩的012---Come on, it'll be fun.
这样会让我觉得好过一点012---It'll make me feel so much better.
听着  我很感激  但这样有点奇怪012---Look, I appreciate it, but it's a little creepy.
我已经不是单身汉了012---I'm not a bachelor anymore.
别把它当成是单身汉派对012---Don't think of it as a bachelor party.
把它当成是结婚两个月的礼物012---Think of it as a twomonth anniversary present.
当然  结婚一年是纸婚012---Sure. One year is paper,
两个月的话可以看艳舞012---but two months is lap dance.
拜托  我觉得好过意不去012---Please, I feel so bad.
就去看看那个辣妹脱光衣服吧012---Just watch the hot woman get naked!
好吧  但我这么做是为了你  太帅了012--- Fine, but I'm only doing this for you.  Yeah!
还有乔伊012---And Joey.
谢谢  你还想邀请谁012---Thank you. Who else do you wanna invite?
光罗斯跟乔伊就够丢脸了012---No, no, no. Just Ross and Joey is embarrassing enough.
抱歉  我没办法去  今晚我跟蒙娜有约012---Actually, sorry, I can't even make it. I'm seeing Mona tonight.
谁会为了假单身汉派对012---I understand: who would cancel an actual date
取消真正的约会012---just to go to a fake bachelor party?
抱歉  我得取消今晚的约会  宝贝012---I'm sorry. I gotta cancel tonight, baby.
抱歉我无法参加你想像出来的婚礼012---I'm sorry I won't make it to your imaginary wedding,
那天我很忙012---but I'm busy that day.
我得参加独角兽受洗礼跟小精灵的戒酒会012---I already have a unicorn baptism and a leprechaun bar mitzvah.
我知道  我乱了方寸012---I know, I know. I panicked. I panicked.
我不想让他对着我大叫012---I didn't want him to start yelling at me
把我当成74年拉图红酒012---like I was some '74 Latour.
是拉费012---It's Lafite.
74年拉图红酒喝起来真的很不错012---The '74 Latour is actually drinking quite nicely.
好吧  他来了  我得告诉他  我会很坚强012---All right, here he comes. I'm gonna tell him. I'm gonna be strong.
我刚刚给一个朋友打了电话012---I just called a friend of mine.
我应该我可以在这么短的时间内012---I think I may be able to book The Plaza
订到广场饭店012---on short notice.
真的吗012---Really?
广场饭店012---The Plaza?
爸爸012---Oh, Daddy!
爸爸  我得跟你谈一谈  请坐012---Right. Daddy, I need to talk to you. Please sit down.
什么事  宝贝012---What is it, sweetie?
我们不会举行婚礼012---There's not gonna be a wedding.
罗斯跟我不会结婚  什么012--- Ross and I aren't getting married.  What?
对不起  爸爸  我不敢相信012--- I'm sorry, Daddy.  I don't believe this!
爸爸  请保持冷静012---Daddy, stay calm, please.
保持冷静  你叫我怎么保持冷静012---Stay calm? How do you expect me to stay calm?
我完全无法接受  瑞秋  我要知道为什么012---This is unacceptable, Rachel. And I wanna know why!
因为那个混蛋不愿意娶你吗012---Is it because that punk Ross won't marry you?
是那样吗  对  他说我是瑕疵品012--- That's it. Is that it?  Yes. He says I'm damaged goods.
快结婚了  你很紧张吧012---So, you nervous about getting married?
你这是搞什么名堂012---What are you doing?
我们假装这是你结婚前的单身汉派对012---Let's pretend it's a real bachelor party, before your wedding.
那样比较好玩012---It'll be more fun.
好吧  我不敢相信明天是我的大喜之日012---All right. I can't believe tomorrow's the big day.
知道你再也没法跟别的女人在一起012---How's it feel knowing you're never gonna
你有什么感觉012---be with another woman again?
知道你每天醒过来都会看到同一张脸012---Knowing you're gonna have to wake up to the same face every day...
直到死神来拯救你012---...until you finally have the sweet release of death.
你说得对  这样比较好玩012---You're right. This is more fun.
她来了  快点012---That's her! Okay, come on!
哪个幸运儿是钱德勒012---Which one of you lucky boys is Chandler?
是我012---That's me!
是我012---That's me.
乔伊·崔比安尼  你的头号仰慕者012---Joey Tribbiani. Big fan.
那是卧室吗  对  就在那边012--- Is that a bedroom?  Yeah, right over there.
好吧  你准备好就进来012---All right. Whenever you're ready.
那好奇怪012---That was weird.
她为什么要到卧室去  我等着呢012--- Why would she go in the bedroom?  I'm waiting.
她是...  她是脱光衣服的妓女012--- So she's a...  Yeah, that's one naked hooker.
我喜欢你家  这玩意从哪里来的012---I love your place. Where is this guy from?
那是在加尔各答买的18世纪印度工艺品012---That's an 18thcentury Indian artifact from Calcutta.
原来你不只喜欢研究恐龙012---So you're more than just dinosaurs.
我涉猎很广的012---So much more.
天啊  我很抱歉012---Oh, my God! I am so sorry!
算了  那是在一号码头商店买的012---Forget it. It's from Pier 1.
抱歉012---Sorry.
你以为你可以搞大我女儿的肚子012---You think you can knock up my daughter
然后不娶她吗012---and then not marry her?
我要杀了你012---I'm gonna kill you!
事实上  我现在真的很不方便012---You know, this is actually not a great time for me.
快解释给我听  盖勒012---So come on. Explain yourself, Geller.
你先让我的瑞秋怀孕012---First, you get my Rachel pregnant.
你让瑞秋怀孕了012---You got Rachel pregnant?
谁干的  就是你012--- Who did?  You did!
是的012---Yes.
没错  但那是一夜情  那毫无意义012---Yes, I did, but it was a onenight thing. It meant nothing.
真的吗  我女儿对你来说毫无意义012---Oh? Really? That's what my daughter means to you, nothing?
不是的  她对我来说意义重大012---No, sir. She means a lot to me.
我在乎...我爱瑞秋012---I care... I love Rachel.
什么  但不是那种爱012--- What?  But not that way.
我没有爱上她  我把她当成朋友012---I'm not in love with her. I love her like a friend.
你就是那样对待朋友的吗012---Really? That's how you treat a friend,
你搞大她的肚子又不肯娶她012---you get her in trouble and refuse to marry her?
我有跟她求婚  但我不是真心的012---Hey, I offered to marry her. But I didn't want to.
为什么  因为你想跟这个荡妇鬼混012---Well, why not? So you could spend your time with this tramp?
荡妇012---Tramp?
抱歉012---I'm sorry.
格林医生  蒙娜  蒙娜  格林医生012---Dr. Green, Mona. Mona, Dr. Green.
我不敢相信里面有个脱光衣服的妓女012---I can't believe there is a naked hooker in there!
或许她是妓女兼脱衣舞娘...012---Wait, wait. Maybe she's a hooker and a stripper...
但她会搞不清楚该做什么012---...but she got confused about what's she supposed to do.
有可能  技术上来说她确实脱光了衣服012---Could be. I mean, technically, she did strip.
只是我们错过了012---We just missed it.
小姐012---Ma'am?
你也是脱衣舞娘吗012---Are you also a stripper?
不是  但我可以假装  那得另外收钱012---No, but I can pretend to strip. But that's gonna cost extra.
这是另外收钱的项目  手拷  鞭打...012---Okay, here's the extras: Handcuffs, spanking...
或许莫妮卡是在跟你开玩笑012---Maybe Monica's playing a joke on you.
帮自己老公找妓女  那真的很好笑012---You know? Getting her own husband a hooker. That's pretty funny.
是很好笑  或许我生日的时候她会去杀人012---That is funny. Maybe for my birthday she'll murder someone.
我敢说罗斯也知情012---I'll bet Ross was in on it too.
他"刚好"很忙012---I mean, he was "conveniently" busy.
你不介意我抽烟吧012---Do you mind if I smoke in here?
你还是不要...012---Actually, I'd rather...
抽吧  反正我们也会烧掉那个房间012---Yeah, go ahead. We're gonna have to burn that room down anyway.
你为什么一直没有告诉我012---How could you have kept all this from me?
我打算告诉你  但是...012---I was going to tell you, but...
但是什么  你以为你可以得到你要的012---But what? You figure you'd get what you wanted,
然后像甩了瑞秋一样甩掉她012---then you'd dump her like you did Rachel.
我没有甩掉瑞秋  我们也没有在一起012---Hey, I did not dump Rachel. Nor are we still together.
我可以...012---Can I...?
让答录机接吧012---Why don't we just let the machine get that.
罗斯  我是乔伊  这里有个妓女012---Hey, Ross, it's Joey. There's a hooker over here...
我们想或许你知情012---...and we thought maybe you'd know something about it.
不012---No! No! No!
不  我需要躺一下012---No! I need to lie down.
今晚是单身汉派对之夜012---So, tonight's the night of the big bachelor party?
对  谢谢你给我那个女孩的电话号码012---Yeah. Thanks for giving me that girl's number.
别客气  这是给谁办的派对012---No problem. Say, who's the party for?
我老公  你帮你老公雇了一个妓女012--- For my husband.  You hired your husband a hooker?
她是脱衣舞娘  不  她是妓女012--- She's a stripper.  No, she's a hooker.
他们有时也这样称呼脱衣舞娘吗012---Is that what they call strippers sometimes?
因为她们本身就是妓女012---When they're hookers.
天啊  史都  我不敢相信你会这么做012---Oh, my God. Stu, I can't believe you did this.
你确定她是妓女吗012---Now, you're absolutely sure she's a hooker?
如果不是的话  那她就是我约过012---It's either that, or she's just the best,
技术最好  价钱最贵的女孩012---most expensive date I ever had.
或许她是故意帮你雇了个妓女012---Maybe she meant to get you a hooker.
她为什么要那么做012---Why would she do that?
或许她要你好好学一学012---Maybe she wants you to learn something.
你在床上有表现不好的方面吗012---Is there anything you're really bad at, you know, sexually?
这个单身汉派对简直烂到家了012---This is the worst bachelor party ever.
你们怎么那么久  再过一分钟就好012--- What's taking you boys so long?  In a minute!
"一分钟"  一分钟内会发生什么事012---"In a minute"? What's gonna happen in a minute?
好吧  或许你该去请她离开012---All right. Maybe you should ask her to leave.
为什么是我  这是你的单身汉派对012--- Why me?  Hey, it's your bachelor party.
所以应该是你去说012---Which is why you should do it.
我不要  你去012---I don't want to. You do it.
你去  你去012--- You do it.  You do it.
好吧  剪刀石头布012---All right. Rock, paper, scissors
决定谁去请那个妓女离开012---for who has to tell the whore to leave.
怎么了012---What?
我想念这种日子012---I miss this.
我觉得我们以前根本没做过这种事012---I don't think we've actually done this before.
不  我想念跟你鬼混的日子012---No, I miss hanging out with you.
我们还是混在一起  跟以前不一样了012--- We still hang out.  Not like we used to.
还记得吗  你跟我我们以前老是黏在一起012---Remember? You and me, we used to be inseparable.
现在一切都变得不一样了012---You know, now it's like things are different.
的确不一样了  我结婚了012---Well, you know, things are different. I'm married now.
别误会我  我为你们感到高兴012---And, hey, don't get me wrong, I am so happy for you guys.
我只是想念我们一起鬼混的日子  知道吗012---I just miss hanging out. Just us, you know?
我也是012---Yeah, I miss that too.
听我说  从现在开始012---I'll tell you what. From now on,
我们要找时间一起出去玩012---we'll make time to hang out with each other.
没问题  过来012---You got it. Come here.
天啊012---Oh, God.
听着  我差一点就要洗劫你们了012---Listen, I am this close to robbing you guys.
她是妓女  她是...012---She's a hooker! She's a hooker! She's a...
嗨  我们通过电话012---Hi. We spoke on the phone.
你爸到过我家012---So your dad dropped by.
他是个好人012---He's a pleasant man.
不  我得走了012--- Oh, no.  I better go.
我只是走到这里来  我不想错过吵架场面012---Just over here. I don't wanna miss the fight.
罗斯  我很抱歉012---Ross, I am so sorry.
我发誓明天我会亲自012---I promise, I will straighten this out
跟他把事情讲清楚012---with him tomorrow, in person.
或是通过电子邮件012---Or via email.
我不在乎你爸  我在乎蒙娜012---I don't care about your dad. I care about Mona.
当时她在场  都快气疯了012---She was there and now she's totally freaked out!
好吧  我也会跟她解释012---Okay, I'll fix that too.
