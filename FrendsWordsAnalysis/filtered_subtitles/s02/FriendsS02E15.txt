歪着头012---The head tilt?
自从我离婚后  每个人跟我问好时012---Since the divorce, everybody asks how I am...
都会同情地歪着头 〝你还好吧  还可以吧〞012---...with a sympathetic head tilt. "How you doing? You okay?"

对不起  不会012---I'm sorry.  No, no.

但他们都好无聊  一堆眼科医生012---But they're so dull. They're all ophthalmologists.
你就是眼科医生012---You're an ophthalmologist.

所以呢  你们两个完全互相着迷012---So? You two are totally into each other.
菲比  他是我爸妈的朋友  他比我大二十岁012---He's a friend of my parents. He's like 20 years older than me.
那你不会再跟他见面012---So you're never gonna see him again?
也不能那么说012---Not never.
我约他明天帮我检查眼睛012---I'm gonna see him tomorrow at my eye appointment.
你不是刚检查过眼睛吗  对  但你知道的012---Didn't you just get your eyes checked? Yeah, but, you know, uh...
27岁的人很容易眼睛发生病变012---...27 is a dangerous eye age.
我不是说那部电影不好看  我只是说那有一点…012---I'm not saying it was a bad movie. I'm just saying it was a little...
难懂012---...hard to follow.
我说过会有字幕的012---I told you there'd be subtitles.
我知道012---I know.
我只是不想  跟你第一次约会就戴眼镜012---I just didn't want to wear my glasses on our first date.
噢012---Oh.
摩妮卡012---Monica?
我希望我吻你时  你叫的不是我妹妹的名字012---It would help when I'm kissing if you didn't shout my sister's name.

怎么了  对不起012---What?  I'm sorry.
对不起  当你的手滑到我屁股上时…012---I'm sorry. It's just, when you moved your hands down to my butt...
我只想到 〝罗斯在摸我的屁股〞012---...it was like, "Whoa, Ross' hands are on my butt!"
抱歉012---Sorry.
很好笑  为什么012---And that's funny why?
不是好笑012---Well, it's not. Uh...
我是说  抱歉  我想我很紧张012---I mean, I'm sorry. I guess I'm just nervous.
毕竟我面对的人是你012---I mean, it's you.
我们在一起了012---You know, it's us.  Mm.
我们越过那条线  这真的很重要012---I mean, we're crossing that line. It's sort of a big thing.
我知道这很重要  我只是不知道它很好笑012---Well, I know it's big. I just didn't know it was ha-ha big.
好吧012---Okay.
好  我没有摸你屁股012---Okay, my hands were nowhere near your butt.
我知道  我知道012---I know, I know, I know!
我只是在想  你刚刚摸了我的屁股012---I was thinking about when they were there the last time.
对不起  好吧  听着  我保证012---I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Okay, look! Whoa, I promise.
我准备好了  我不会再笑  把你的手放回去012---I'm good. I won't laugh anymore. Put your hands back there.
不  你看  现在我没办法了  因为012---No, see, now I can't, because, uh...
我觉得太不自然了012---...I'm feeling too self-conscious.
摸一边就好  不了012---Just one cheek.  No. Ha.
感觉没了012---The moment's gone.
我可以背对你  让你摸  那还真是浪漫012---I'll back up into your hands.  That's romantic.
摸一下  不要012---Touch it. No.
来吧  捏一下  不要012---Oh, come on, squeeze it. No!
揉一下  不要012---Rub it? No.

看  车子起火了012---Wow, look at that. The car is on fire...
但上面昂贵的烤漆…012---...yet somehow its expensive paint job...
却被奇迹蜡保护得毫发无伤012---...is protected by the Miracle Wax.

听着  你们跟女生亲热时…012---Have you ever been, you know, fooling around with a girl...
对方会笑个不停吗012---...and, uh, she started laughing?
会  但那是1982年…012---Yeah, but, uh, it was 1982...
我的瀑布发型对着她的下巴搔痒012---...and my Flock of Seagulls haircut was tickling her chin.
