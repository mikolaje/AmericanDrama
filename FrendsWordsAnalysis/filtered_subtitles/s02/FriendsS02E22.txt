我想我会做水煮鲑鱼012---...I thought I'd poach a salmon. GROUP: Oh.
干嘛012---What?
问题是为什么每次办派对  你都要做水煮食物012---Question: Why do we always have to have parties where you poach things?
你要加入食物委员会吗012---You wanna be in charge of the food committee?
问题二  为什么我们办派对  一定要有委员会012---Question two: Why do we always have parties with committees?

别邀请莎朗古柏012---Whoa, whoa, whoa. Uh, no Shannon Cooper.
为什么不邀请她012---Why not her?
因为她会偷东西012---Because she, uh... She steals stuff.
或许她没偷东西012---Or maybe she doesn't steal stuff...
乔伊只是跟她上过床  没回她电话012---...and Joey slept with her and never called her back.
乔伊  那太低级了  我喜欢她012---Joey, that is horrible. Hey, I liked her.

我想我们不能邀她爸妈012---Okay, so I guess we don't invite her parents.
只邀她妈妈呢  为什么012---Well, how about just her mom? Why her mom?

葛林医生  请跟我来  我们得把你的外套放在瑞秋床上012---Hey, Dr. Green, come with me. We'll put your jacket on Rachel's bed.
好吧  听起来那需要两个人才能做好012---All right. That sounds like a two-person job.
天啊  那是怎么一回事012---Well, my goodness. What was that?
抱歉  我以为你是瑞秋012---Sandra, I am so sorry. I thought you were Rachel.
我们还没准备好012---And we weren't ready for you yet.
你以为我是瑞秋  对  因为你看起来很年轻012---You thought I was Rachel? Yes, because, uh, you look so young.

不  你是什么意思012---No. No. What do you mean "no"?
不行  因为那是准备区012---No, um, see, because that's the staging area.
你跑到那里去  会毁了你对派对的幻想012---You go in there, it'll ruin the whole illusion of the party.
对  拿着你的威士忌回那里去012---Yeah, I think, you take your Scotch back in there...
