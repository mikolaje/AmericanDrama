那不是那个以前戴你帽子的家伙吗012---Hey, isn't that the guy who used to wear your hat?
你看他们现在坐在哪儿012---And look where they're sitting.
你开玩笑吧  你们才刚刚进门012---You're joking, right? You guys just walked through the door.

好吧012---All right.
我们到外面谈谈吧012---Let's take this outside.
〝我们到外面谈谈〞012---"Let's take this outside"?
谁这么说话啊012---Who talks like that?

你一定要问  是吧  真是的012---You had to ask. Yeah.
好吧  这样…012---Okay, okay, look. See...
我们并不打算跟你们打架012---...the thing is, we're not gonna fight you guys.
那有个条件012---Here's the deal.
只要你们永远不在这里出现  就不用跟我们打架012---You won't have to, so long as you never ever show your faces here again.
我认为你的阿甘牌打得太早了012---I think you played the Gunther card too soon.

不管她怎么说012---Despite what she says.
我还有个妹妹  尽管我们分享过  同一个子宫  但我几乎不和她说话012---And I have a sister who I've barely spoken to since we shared a womb.
不知道  这是我真正的父亲…012---I don't know. This is my real father...
我只希望事情很顺利012---...and I want things to be, like, just right.

还有 〝别逼我过去痛宰  你们这些华尔街浑蛋〞012---...and "Don't make me come down there and kick your Wall Street butt."
我在早餐之前赚了17元  你呢012---I made $17 before breakfast. What have you done?

金融常识有待加强的朋友…012---Well, my financially challenged friends...
我用我的钱分别买了 一些CHP和ZXY012---...I split my money and I bought some shares of CHP and ZXY.
为什么要买这些012---How come those?
嗯  CHP是我以前很喜欢的演员名字缩写012---Well, CHP because I used to have a crush on Erik Estrada.
ZXY是因为  我认为它听起来像〝性感〞012---And ZXY because I think it sounds "zexy."

那狗怎么样了012---Oh, hey, how's the dog? Yeah.
我跟兽医谈过了  北边的人真是很友善012---Okay. I talked to the vet. People are so nice upstate.
他说小家伙会没事的  我明天就可以去接他012---He said the little fella's gonna be okay, and I can get him tomorrow.
好极了  多谢老天爷012---Good. Oh, thank God.
不过他不得不多缝几针012---But he did have to have a bunch of stitches.
而且他说  狗的耳朵重新长出来  真的是千载难逢012---And he said that only once in a blue moon does a dog's ear grow back.
我还在盼望中012---So still hoping.
菲比  现在你会打电话给你父亲  让他知道他的狗没事了吧012---Now are you gonna call your dad to let him know that his dog is okay?
我不想跟我爸在电话上相认012---I don't want to meet my father over the phone.
我要说什么 〝我是菲比  你抛弃的女儿012---What will I say, "Hi, I'm the daughter you abandoned.
顺便说一句  我弄伤了你的狗〞012---Oh, by the way, I broke your dog."
菲比  如果你愿意  我来帮你打012---Hey, Pheebs, if you want, I'll do it.
好的012---Okay.
别说任何关于我的事情012---Listen, just don't say anything about me, okay?

喂  布非太太012---Uh, hello, Mrs. Buffay.
我知道你的狗在哪里012---I know where your dog is.
我想让你知道  24小时之内…012---I want you to know he'll be returned to you almost as good as new...
他会几乎  像全新一样还给你012---...within 24 hours.
再见012---Uh, goodbye.
为什么是那种声音  很难说012---Why the voice?  Hard to say.
先生，您的卡布其诺012---Your cappuccino, sir.
谢谢012---Thank you.
我觉得这里比咖啡店好多了  绝对好多了012---This is better than the coffeehouse.  Absolutely.
这怎么不会溶在水里012---How come it's not mixing with the water?
包装上说  你要不停的搅动012---The package says to keep it moving.
边搅边喝  边搅边喝  别停下来012---Stir and drink, never let it settle.
这太荒谬了012---This is ridiculous.
这样吧  等我从我侄女的洗礼回来后012---After I get back from my niece's christening...
我跟你们一起到咖啡厅  一起享受一杯好咖啡012---...l'll go to the coffeehouse with you and we'll have a cup of coffee.
没问题  有乔伊在012---No problem. Joey's there, hmm?

我不想要每次想喝杯好咖啡  都要有乔伊陪着012---I don't want to have to have Joey with me every time I want decent coffee.
我不想在后半生都喝 〝K〞开头的卡布其诺012---And I don't want to drink cappuccino with a "k."
我说  你和我下去  勇敢面对那些家伙012---I say you and I go and stand up to those guys.
等等  猛男012---All right, hang on a second there, Custer.
罗斯  你被痛揍过吗012---Ross, have you ever been beaten up before?
当然012---Yeah, sure.
被摩妮卡以外的人  没有012---By someone besides Monica? No.
那又怎么012---So what?
被痛揍又怎样  也许那是  每个男人一生中都要经历的事情012---So we get beaten up. Maybe that's something a man has to go through.
就像成年礼之类的东西012---Like a rite of passage or something.
我们能不能  只是再次失去我们的童贞012---Couldn't we just lose our virginities again?
