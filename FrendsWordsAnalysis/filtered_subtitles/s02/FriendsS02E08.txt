他是轻轻吻你的嘴唇012---Was it like a soft brush against your lips...
还是〝我想立刻拥有你〞 那样的吻012---...or was it like a, you know, "I gotta have you now" kind of thing?
刚开始真的很急迫  然后012---Well, at first it was really intense, you know? And then...

是没错  但我回到家012---Yeah, it was. But I get home, okay...
看到茱莉放在我桌上的食盐水012---...and I see Julie's saline solution on my night table...
我就想〝天啊  我是在干什么〞012---...and I think, "Oh, my God. What the hell am I doing?"
我跟茱莉这么棒的女人在一起012---I mean, here I am with Julie, this incredible, great woman...
彼此关怀珍惜012---...who I care about and who cares about me...
而我就那样抛弃一切吗012---...and am I just gonna throw all that away?

有个女孩名叫贝蒂012---There was a girl We'll call her Betty

我想特别郑重声明…012---Now I can't stress This point too strongly
这故事不是真的012---This story isn't real
现在尼尔必须决定 他要放弃哪个女孩012---Now our Neil must decide Who will be the girl that he casts aside?
是他深爱的那个贝蒂012---Will Betty be the one Who he loves truly?
还是我们叫狐狸精的那个012---Or will it be the one Who we'll call Loolie?
他必须决定  他必须决定012---He must decide He must decide

莱斯特先生  这工作要做什么  广告里没说清楚012---Uh, Mr. Rastatter, what does this job entail? The ad wasn't clear.
摩克力012---Mockolate.
什么  摩克力  巧克力的人工替代品012---I'm sorry? Mockolate.
巧克力的人工替代品012---It's a synthetic chocolate substitute.

我们认为摩克力比巧克力更好吃012---Yeah, we think that Mockolate is even better than chocolate.
好的012---All right. Ha, ha.
恩012---Mm.
对吧012---Yeah. Ha-ha-ha.
我喜欢它碎掉的感觉012---I love how it crumbles.
那是巧克力不会有的  是啊012---You see, chocolate doesn't do that. Ha-ha-ha. No, ma'am.
我们很快就能得到食品认证012---Anyhoo, we should be getting our FDA approval any day now.
哈哈哈012---RASTATTER: Ha-ha-ha.
希望赶得上感恩节前上市012---Hopefully, in time for Thanksgiving. Mm.
我们是这么想的  巧克力垄断了…012---See, the way we look at it, chocolate dominates...
主要的年节市场  比如说复活节  圣诞节012---...your major food-preparation holidays. Easter, Christmas, what have you.
但我们相信只要有适当行销012---Mm-hm.But we think given the right marketing...
我们可以让感恩节  变成摩克力的节日012---...we can make Thanksgiving the Mockolate holiday.
哇012---Wow.
你不吞下去吗012---Aren't you gonna swallow that? Ha, ha.
我在等泡泡消失012---Just waiting for it to stop bubbling. Oh.
是啊  那很棒对吧012---Yeah. Isn't that great?
唔   哈哈哈012---Mm. Ha-ha-ha.
这个  不管怎么  恩012---Well, anyhoo, um...
总之  我们想找个能创作感恩节食谱的大厨012---...we're looking for chefs who can create Thanksgiving-themed recipes.
你有兴趣吗012---You interested?
当…012---Abso...
然012---Ahem... . Lutely!
我喜欢创作食谱  也喜欢感恩节  现在…012---See, I love creating new recipes, I love Thanksgiving, and, well, now...
我还爱上摩克力012---...I love Mockolate.
真的012---Really? Mm.
尤其是那余味  我敢说…012---Especially that aftertaste. You know, I tell you...
可以撑到圣诞节012---...that'll last you till Christmas.
摩克力慕思如何012---How about Mockolate mousse?
感觉…012---It's not...
不像感恩节012---...very Thanksgiving-y.
那么清教徒摩克力慕思呢012---Okay, how about Pilgrim Mockolate mousse?
跟清教徒有何关系012---What makes it Pilgrim?
我们在上面放扣环012---We'll put buckles on it.
嘿  嘿012---Hey.  Hey.
嘿  罗斯有来电吗012---Hey.  Did Ross call?
很遗憾没有012---No, I'm sorry.
他为何没打电话012---Why didn't he call?
他要跟茱莉一起  对吧012---He's gonna stay with Julie.
他会选择她而她会说012---He's gonna stay with her and she'll be:
〝嗨  我是茱莉  罗斯选择我012---"Hi, I'm Julie. Ross picked me.
我们会结婚生子一起老死〞012---We'll get married and have lots of kids and dig up stuff together!"
我无意冒犯  但听起来一点都不像她012---No offense, but that sounds nothing like her.
我不知道该怎么办  我该怎么办  这真是个梦魇012---I don't know what I'll do. What am I gonna do? This is like a complete nightmare!
我知道这一定很难 〝不要啊 有两个女人爱我012---Oh, I know. This must be so hard. "Oh, no! Two women love me!
她们两个都很漂亮又性感 我的钱包太小装不下钱012---They're both gorgeous and sexy, my wallet's too small for my 50s...
我的钻石鞋也太紧了〞012---...and my diamond shoes are too tight!"
我想到了  罗斯…  别碰我的电脑  别碰电脑012---Hey, here's a thought, Ross... - Don't ever touch the computer.
罗斯  你听着  我有两个字送给你012---Ross, listen. I got two words for you:
三人行012---Threesome.
好  我们理性一点  列张清单012---Right, look. Let's get logical about this. We'll make a list.
写出瑞秋和茱莉的优缺点012---"Rachel and Julie: Pros and Cons."
噢   噢012---Oh.  Oh.
她们的名字可以用不同的字体012---We'll put their names in bold with different fonts...
还能用不同颜色的栏位显示012---...and I can use different colors for each column.
不能用写的吗012---Can't we just use a pen?
不行  原始人012---No, Amish boy.
我们先从缺点开始  那比较好玩012---Let's start with the cons because they're more fun.
先说瑞秋吧012---Ha-ha-ha. Rachel first.
不知道012---I don't know.
我觉得…012---I mean...
好吧  我想你可以说她有时候有点大小姐012---All right, I guess you can say she's a little spoiled sometimes.
没错012---You could say that.
耶012---Yeah.
有时候她还有点三八012---I guess, you know, sometimes she's a little ditzy, you know?
有时候她也太爱漂亮了012---And I've seen her be a little too into her looks.
茱莉和我有很多共同点012---Uh. Oh, and Julie and I have a lot in common...
因为我们都是古生物学家012---...because we're both paleontologists, right?
瑞秋只是个服务生012---But Rachel's just a waitress.
服务生012---Waitress.
了解  你们想玩《毁灭战士》吗012---Got it. You guys wanna play "Doom"?
我们也可以继续写012---Or we could keep doing this.

我不知道012---I don't know.
喔  她的脚踝有点肉肉的012---Oh, her ankles are a little chubby.
好吧  说说茱莉吧012---Okay, let's do Julie.
她有何缺点012---What's wrong with her?

尼德大叫〝喔  你看〞012---'Oh, look! ' cried Ned.

就这样  你只写这样  你是世界上最糟糕的作家012---That's it? That's all you wrote? You're the worst writer in the world!
这不好玩012---This isn't funny anymore.
那纸上一定写了我什么  我要看012---There's something about me on that piece of paper, and I want to see it.

〝她不是瑞球〞012---"She's not Rachem"?
〝瑞球〞是什么东西012---No...What the hell's a Rachem?
是古生物学家会用的蠢字眼012---No, no... Is that some stupid paleontology word...
而我没听过  因为我只是个服务生012---...that I wouldn't know because I'm just a waitress?
瑞秋  别这样012---No. Rach, come on! Rach...

如果我说是日记的话  她就不会要我念了012---If I'd said it was my diary, she wouldn't have made me read it.
那倒是真的  你是很好的事后诸葛012---No, that's true. You'd be a great person to have around the day after an emergency.
我不敢相信罗斯会列这种清单012---I cannot believe Ross even made this list.
就是说啊  真是个白痴012---I know.  What a dinkus!
别再骂他了  那是钱德的主意012---Hey, cut him some slack. It was Chandler's idea.
什么  什么012---What?  What?
很好  我就是在等这一刻012---Oh, good. I was hoping that would come up.

瑞秋012---Rach! Whoa...
瑞秋012---Rach!
打开  好吗012---Hey! Uh, open up! Please?
你按铃没人应门  那就表示〝滚蛋〞…012---When somebody does not buzz you in, Ross, that means, "Go away."
而不是〝爬救生梯上来〞012---That doesn't mean, "Climb up the fire escape."
我要告诉你  你的优点012---I just want to read you something, your "Pro List."
没兴趣012---Not interested.
好…012---Okay, okay.

他希望你能够原谅他012---...and he hopes you can find it in your heart to forgive him.
我们刚接到瑞秋来电012---Uh, we've just gotten a call from Rachel...
她告诉我们罗斯的恶行012---...and she told us what Ross did.
那真是太可怕了 罗斯  如果你在听的话012---It's pretty appalling. And, Ross, if you're listening...
