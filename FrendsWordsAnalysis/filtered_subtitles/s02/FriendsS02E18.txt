但我们永远  不会有结果的012---But you and I can never be together that way.

接下来呢012---So, what happens next?
我帮连体婴做分割手术  得了医学奖012---Well, I get the medical award for separating the Siamese twins.

把二十个手无寸铁的人  串成一长条…012---Twenty armless guys joined at the waist by a steel bar...
被迫无止境的踢足球012---...forced to play soccer forever? Ugh!

我会把小塑胶妞拿出来  大家都会很开心啊012---...I break out the plastic women and everybody has a pretty good time.
你为什么不跟你的室友玩012---Why don't you play with your roommate?
他…012---Eh, he's, uh...
他不太喜欢手足球012---He's not a big fan of foosball.
跟新室友处不来吗012---Uh-oh. Ooh. Are we not getting along with the new boy?
也不是  他只是花很多时间  在自己的房间里012---No, he's all right. He just, uh, spends most of his time in his room.
或许是因为你还没  花时间去了解他012---Maybe because you haven't taken time to get to know him.
我们来补救一下012---Let's remedy that, shall we?
我们不用补救  有必要  会很好玩的012---We don't need to remedy that. - Oh, yeah, it'll be fun!

很不错  是谁跟谁提分手的012---Ha-ha-ha. That's good. So who broke up with who?
开什么玩笑  当然是我提的012---You kidding? I broke up with her.
她以为西恩潘是柬埔寨的首都012---She actually thought Sean Penn was the capital of Cambodia.
太好笑了  大家都知道  东埔寨的首都是…012---When everybody knows that the, uh, capital of Cambodia is...

我不想再见到你了〞012---...I don't wanna see you anymore." Ha, ha.
感觉就像是她把手  放进我的胸膛里面012---It was literally like she had reached into my chest...
把心挖出来  把我的生活搞得一团乱012---...ripped out my heart and smeared it all over my life!
我像是掉进无止境的深渊012---There was this incredible abyss and I'm falling.
我不断地往下掉  好像永远不会着地012---I keep falling and I don't think I'm ever gonna stop!
这故事不太好笑  对吧012---That wasn't such a funny story, was it?
坏脾气的老头  说我会尽量012---And a crusty old man Said I'll do what I can
其他老鼠开始摇沙铃012---And the rest of the rats Played maracas
结束了  晚安012---That's it! Thanks! Good night.

算是啦012---Well, kind of, yeah.
记得上星期亚莉发生意外吗012---Remember last week when Alex was in the accident?
原本的台词是…012---The line in the script was:
〝如果不把她送到医院  她就会死掉〞012---"If we don't get this woman to a hospital, she's going to die."
但是我把它改成 〝如果不把她送到医院…012---But I made it, "If this woman doesn't get to a hospital...
她就活不了〞012---...she's not gonna live."
噢  我懂了012---Oh, okay. I see what you did there.
你不怕编剧读到这个时  会生气吗012---Aren't you afraid the writers will be kind of mad when they read this?
呵012---Huh.
我从不考虑那些编剧  剧本就是送到我家012---I never thought about the writers. The scripts just come to my house.
但是你知道吗012---But you know what?

我不认为这会影响剧情012---I don't think that's gonna affect the plot of the show.
他们怎么可以这样对我012---How can they do this to me?
好  我要走了012---All right, uh, I'm just gonna go.
很遗憾012---Sorry.
也没有那么多男性012---Well, it wasn't that many guys.
如果你想想  这世上有多少男性的话…012---If you consider how many guys there actually are...
比例其实很小  嘿012---...it's a very small percentage.  Hey.
没什么大不了的  我只是好奇而已012---It's not that big a deal. I was just curious.
晚安  晚安  理查012---Good night. Good night, Richard.

两个  两个  两个012---Two. Two? Two? Heh.
怎么可能012---How is that possible? I mean...
你有看过自己的样子吗012---...have you seen you?
我能说什么呢012---Well, I mean, what can I say?
我和芭芭拉做了三十年的夫妻  她是我高中的女友012---I was married to Barbara for 30 years, my high-school sweetheart.

你少来012---Oh, come on!
我不需要确切的数字  差不多就行了012---You know, I don't need the actual number. Just a ballpark.
好  绝对没有棒球场的人多012---Okay, it is definitely less than a ballpark.
哇  真庆幸我不是摩妮卡012---Wow, I am so glad I'm not Monica right now.
没错012---Tell me about it.
那你的神奇数字是多少012---So, what's your magic number?
恩012---Ahh...
别这样  我交往过的你都认识  两个都知道012---Come on, you know everyone I've been with. All both of them.
嗯  有你012---Well, ahem, there's you.
最好不要说我是第一个012---Better not be doing these in order.

还有  噢巴洛012---And, uh, oh, Paolo.
是啊  那个托里尼来的蠢蛋012---Oh, yes, the weenie from Turinie.
噢  亲爱的  你嫉妒巴洛吗012---Oh, honey, are you jealous of Paolo?
我跟你在一起  比跟他快乐多了012---I'm so much happier with you than I ever was with him.
真的吗   拜托012---Really? Oh, please.
跟巴洛那段  根本称不上感情关系012---That Paolo thing was barely a relationship.
充其量只是无意义的  野兽性关系012---All it really was was just meaningless, animal sex.
嗯  那句话在我脑海里  听起来好很多012---Okay, you know, that sounded so much better in my head.
艾迪  我没有和你的前女友上床012---Eddie! I didn't sleep with your ex-girlfriend.
真有趣  跟她睡过的人  就会这么说012---That's exactly what someone who slept with her would say.
太疯狂了  她只待了两分钟…012---This is nuts! Crazy! She came over for two minutes...
留下鱼缸就走了  只有这样012---...dropped off a fish tank and left! End of story.
巴迪在哪里  巴迪012---Where's Buddy? Buddy?
我的鱼  巴迪012---My fish, Buddy.
她来的时候没有鱼啊012---There was no fish when she dropped it off.
噢  真是无法置信012---Oh, this is unbelievable!
你先是跟我的前女友上床  再说谎侮辱我的智商…012---You sleep with my ex-girlfriend, insult my intelligence by lying...
然后杀掉我的鱼  我的巴迪012---...then you kill my fish? My Buddy?
我没有杀掉你的鱼012---I didn't kill your fish!
听着  艾迪…012---Look, Eddie...
看看我在做什么012---Would you look at what I'm doing?
绝对不是明智之举012---Now that can't be smart.
把这个家伙从你身上拿开…012---So we're just gonna take this guy right off you...
放到口袋里面012---...and put him here in Mr. Pocket.
来颗橘子吗012---Tangelo?
就这样  你害怕告诉我的数字  只有这样012---That's it? That's the giant number you were afraid to tell me?
是啊  不会太糟啊012---Well, yeah.  Well, that's not bad at all.
我还以为有一整个舰队呢012---You had me thinking it was, like, a fleet.
你真的不介意012---You're okay with it?
亲爱的  我没问题012---Oh, honey, I'm fine.
好耶012---Oh, yay!
好  你那两个人012---Okay, about that two.
什么012---What?
好012---All right.
我那两个人怎么了012---What about my two?
那个数目真的很小012---It just seems like a really small number.
对012---Right.
所以呢   嗯…012---And?  And, well...
你没有欲望到处去采花吗012---Don't you have a lot of wild oats to sow?
你现在就是那样对我吗  天啊  我是花吗012---Or is that what you're doing with me? Oh, my God! Am I an oat?
亲爱的  你不是花012---Honey, you are not an oat.
我也不知道  我不是那种采花大盗012---I don't know, I guess I'm just not an oat guy.
我只和我爱的人上床012---I've only slept with women I love.
但你只跟两个人睡过012---You've only slept with two people.
对012---Right.
哇012---Wow.
哦  哇012---Oh, wow.
你知道我也爱你吧012---You know I love you too, right?
我现在知道了012---Now I do.
罗斯012---Ugh, Ross!
罗斯  请你听我说012---Ross, please listen to me.
罗斯  你比巴洛好太多了012---Ross, you are so much better for me than Paolo ever was.
你关心我  你爱我  你让我发笑012---You care about me, you're loving, you make me laugh.
那样的话  我有个主意012---If I make you laugh, here's an idea.
你就邀请巴洛过来野性一下  我就站在角落…012---Invite Paolo to have a romp in the sack, and I'll stand in the corner...
讲些笑话给你听  罗斯012---...and tell knock-knock jokes. Ross! Agh!
天啊  罗斯012---God, Ross!
你和我的关系很特别  巴洛和我只是…012---What you and I have is special! All Paolo and I ever had was...
野兽性关系012---Animal sex, animal sex?
你是什么意思012---So, what are you saying?
我们之间完全没有野性吗012---There's nothing between us "animal" at all?
连小野兽都没有吗012---There's not even, like, um, a little animal?
连…012---Not even, like...
花粟鼠性关系都没有012---...chipmunk sex?
好  罗斯…012---Okay, Ross...
试着听进去我说的话012---Try to hear me, okay?
嘿  我不会对你说谎012---I... Hey. I'm not gonna lie to you.
跟巴洛很棒  笑话来了012---It was good with Paolo.  Knock-knock.
但你和我的关系  好太多了012---But what you and I have is so much better.
我们之间有温柔  有亲密  灵犀相通012---We have tenderness, we have intimacy, we connect.
