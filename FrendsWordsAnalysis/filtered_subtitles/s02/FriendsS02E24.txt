乔伊  试镜试得怎么样  超赞的012---How did the audition go? Incredible.
我认识了导演  你们一定不会相信导演是谁012---I met the director. You'll never believe who it was.
是谁012---Who?
给你们一点提示012---I'll give you one hint.
华伦比提012---Warren Beatty.
哇噢012---Wow.
只是可能有个小问题012---There's just one thing that might be a problem.
是这样的  我不得不亲一个男人012---See, I had to kiss this guy.
因为他帅到不行吗012---Because he was just so darn cute?
不是  是试镜过程的一部分  我想争取的角色…012---No, part of the audition. I'm up for the part of this guy...
我演和他接吻那部分012---...who the main guy kisses.
反正你是演员  咬咬牙就上了吧012---Well, you're an actor. I say you just suck it up and you do it.
或者直接上也行012---Or you just do it.
我亲了  我很专业012---I did do it. I'm a professional.
那问题在哪儿  试镜后…012---What's the problem? After the scene...
比提先生过来找我 他说〝演得好  接吻很烂〞012---...Mr. Beatty comes up to me and he says, "Good actor. Bad kisser."
你们相信吗  居然说我不是接吻高手012---Can you believe that? Me, not a good kisser.
就像在说…012---That's like...
德蕾莎修女不是好妈妈一样012---...Mother Teresa, not a good mother. Pfft.
谁管那家伙怎么想012---Who cares what that guy thinks?
华伦比提哪懂什么叫接吻012---What does Warren Beatty know about kissing? Heh.
噢  嘿  嘿012---Oh. Heh, heh.

比提先生星期一要再看一遍012---Mr. Beatty wants to see it again on Monday.
老天爷  我得找出  自己到底哪里做错012---Man, I gotta figure out what I'm doing wrong.
好  你们哪个女生过来亲我一下012---Oh, okay. One of you girls come over here and kiss me.
休想  想得美012---Forget it. Yeah, right.
拜托  我需要你们的帮忙012---Hey, come on. I need your help here.
我来吧  我以前亲过他  我可以再亲一遍012---I'll do it. I've kissed him before. I can do it again.
瞧  这才叫朋友012---See this, huh? This is a friend.
开始吧012---Uh-huh. Let's go.
等一下  我嘴里有口香糖012---Oh, wait. I have gum.
好了012---Okay.
很好  非常好  坚定而温柔012---Good. Very good. Firm, but tender.
我会跟朋友推荐你012---I'd recommend you to a friend.
那我就不知道问题到底在哪儿012---Then I don't know what the problem is.
乔伊  也许你不习惯亲男生012---Maybe you're not used to kissing men.
也许你只是太紧张了一点012---Maybe you tensed up a little.
也许那才是你该多练习的012---Maybe you need to work on it.
没错  有道理012---Yeah, that makes sense.
除非我死了012---Over my dead body.
我会拿他的尸体当挡箭牌012---And I'll be using his dead body as a shield.
出来吧  亲爱的  我跟你说  你看起来很美012---Come out, honey. I'm telling you, you look good.
快说她看起来很美…告诉她很漂亮012---Tell her she looks good. Tell her she looks good.
我的天啊012---Oh, my God! Ha, ha, ha.
你看起来真美012---You look so good!
我真不敢相信自己  要在两百人面前走上红毯…012---I cannot believe I have to walk down the aisle in front of 200 people...
打扮得像恶心想吐时要喝的饮料012---...looking like something you drink when you're nauseous.
那别穿了  我不明白我们为什么要去012---So don't. I don't see why we have to go to this thing.
反正是你前未婚夫的婚礼012---it's your ex-fiance's wedding.
因为我答应敏蒂了012---Because I promised Mindy I would.
你不是也答应巴瑞要嫁给他吗012---Yeah, well, you promised Barry you'd marry him.
各位  我得走了  我是伴娘012---You guys, I have to go. I'm the maid of honor.
除了那次  我只想再见见这些人012---Besides, I need to be in a room again with these people...
自己开心就行012---...and feel good about myself.
有人还穿着昨天晚上的衣服  很忙吗012---Someone's wearing the same clothes they had on last night. Get a little action?
好像是012---I may have.
喔呼  种马012---Whoo-hoo! Stud!
她长什么样子  我们没见过面012---What's she look like? We haven't met.
只是在网上聊了一个通宵012---We stayed up all night talking on the Internet.
电脑宅男012---Whoo-hoo! Geek!
我喜欢这女生  真的很喜欢这女生012---I like this girl. I seriously like this girl.
你们也知道我防卫心强  会讽刺人012---You know how I tend to get a little defended and quippy?
哪有  根本没有好吗012---Get out. No. Please.
她很直接揭穿我  她说 〝别装了 面对现实吧〞012---Well, she called me on it, okay? She said, "Cut it out, get real."
我就是这样做的012---And I did.
哇012---Wow.
做成什么样子012---What's that like?
就像这样  做我自己012---It's like this. Me.
不嬉皮笑脸012---No jokes.
别说了  你吓到我了012---Stop it. You're freaking me out.

不知道我们的婚礼会是什么样子012---I wonder what our wedding will be like.
你说什么啊  什么婚礼012---What are you talking about? What wedding?
别装了  你们从没聊过吗012---Come on. You never talk about that?
从来没有012---No, never.
我们活在当下012---We're just living in the moment.
终于不用一直绕着 〝我们未来会怎样〞问题打转012---It is so nice for once not to get hung up on, "Where is this going?"
你怕问他吗  怕得要命012---Afraid to ask him? Could not be more terrified.
我觉得你该认真考虑下婚姻了012---I think you should seriously consider marriage.
再给瑞秋一次打扮得 像水果口香糖公主的机会012---Give Rachel another chance to dress like Princess Bubble Yum.
小班在哪里012---Where's Benny?
在这里012---There he is!
小班在哪里012---Where's Benny?
在这里012---There he is!
小宝宝之所以学说话  大概是要叫大人闭嘴012---That's probably why babies learn to talk, so they can tell grownups to cut it out.
我想问你个问题012---Hey, I got a question for you.
小事情  别有压力012---Just a little thing, no pressure.
好012---Okay.
你有想过未来的规划吗012---Do you ever, uh, think about the future?
当然有012---Sure, I do.

不是狗012---Not a basset.
是婴儿摇篮012---A bassinet.
你需要那个摇篮012---You really need the bassinet?
我怕宝宝被狗压着012---Well, I just think the baby would keep falling off the dog.
我们的未来里  难道没有小孩吗012---Do you not see kids in our future?  Oh. Heh.
我喜欢小孩012---I love children.
我有小孩012---I have children.
我不想等70岁  小孩上大学后…012---I don't wanna be 70 when our kids go off to college...
我们的生活才终于开始012---...and our life can finally start.
听着012---Hm. Look.
我想要你…012---I want you...
现在012---...now.
真好  我们现在不需要谈论这个012---Well, that's great. We don't need to talk about this now.
反正还要很久很久012---Really, I mean this is so, like, way, way, way in the future.
我现在聊气垫船跟猿人占领地球012---I'm talking hovercrafts and apes taking over the planet. Heh, heh.

理查按门铃  他在楼下012---Richard buzzed. He's downstairs.
理查来了  我下去跟他道别012---Richard's here? I should run down, say goodbye to him.
再见  祝你好运012---Bye. Good luck.

那是什么012---Hey, what is all that?

〝握握〞是什么意思012---What does she mean by "H.H."?
表示我们在牵手012---It means we're holding hands.
你真的好可爱012---Are you the cutest?
恐怕大概是吧012---I'm afraid I might just be.
你这样全心全意对待一个人  我觉得真的很棒012---I think it's so great that you're totally into this person...
但她有可能已经90岁  或是有两颗头012---...yet for all you know, she could be 90 years old or have two heads.
还有可能是个男人012---It could be a guy.
她不是男人好吗  我了解她012---It's not a guy, all right? I know her.
有可能是大块头男子汉012---It could be like a big, giant guy.
可恶  就差那么一点点  摩妮卡在后面踹了我一脚012---Man, I got this close to him, and Monica kneed me in the back.
怎么了012---What's going on?
我们在猜  钱德的女友是不是女生012---We're wondering if Chandler's girlfriend is a girl.
问她会活多久012---Ask her how long she's gonna live.
女人总比男人活得长012---Women live longer than men.
你怎么没多跌两跤012---How do you not fall down more?

好012---All right.
〝我丈夫跟他的秘书上床〞012---"My husband is sleeping with his secretary."
她结婚了012---She's married?
至少我们确定她是女人了012---At least we know she's a woman.
真不敢相信她结婚了012---I can't believe she's married.
兄弟  我很遗憾012---Oh, man, I'm sorry.
你一定很难过012---This must be really tough for you.
我看过一篇文章  上面说婚礼上不该撒米…012---I read this article that says you're not supposed to throw rice at weddings...
因为鸽子吃米会撑死它们的012---...because when pigeons eat rice, it kills them.
难怪寿司店都看不到鸽子012---That's why you never see pigeons in sushi bars.
瞧  我们这不是很开心吗  当然012---See, we're having fun. Oh, absolutely.
我甚至没想到  我们不该想的那件事012---I'm not even thinking about that thing that we're not gonna think about.
我也是012---Neither am I.
嗨  你还好吗012---Hey, there. Are you all right?
我在洗手间看见我上次婚礼爬出去的那个窗户012---Yeah. But in the bathroom, I saw the window I crawled out of at my wedding.

大家看到我会评头论足  还会想到上一次的事012---People are gonna be looking at me and judging me and thinking about the last time.

一般来说  大家的焦点在新娘身上012---Generally, people focus on the bride.
我知道  你说的对012---I know, you're right.
好了  大家看我  很好012---Alrighty. Everybody look at me. Good.
是时候了  伴娘  接待…012---It's time. Bridesmaids and ushers...

抱歉喔  你要我怎么做012---What could I do?
站起来大叫 〝瑞秋  你屁股露出来了〞012---Stand up and shout, "Hey, Rachel, your butt is showing!"
我的天啊  实在是太丢脸了012---Oh, my God. This is so humiliating.
唯一更丢脸的  是我国二时…012---The only thing that tops that was when I was in eighth grade...
我得在全校面前唱《科巴卡巴那》012---...and I had to sing the "Copacabana" in front of the entire school.
才唱两句我就吓跑了012---Two lines into it, I ran and freaked out.
天啊  我悲惨的人生再现眼前了012---Oh, my God. My entire life's flashing before my eyes.
瑞秋  我记得那一次  其实也没那么糟012---Rach, look, I remember that. It wasn't so bad.
罗斯  得了吧  你已经得到我了  我在跟你约会012---Ross, would you stop! You got me. I'm dating you.
瑞秋012---Rachel.
嗨  温伯老师  师母012---Hi, Mr. Weinberg. Hi, Mrs. Weinberg.
很高兴再次看见你  亲爱的012---It's wonderful to see you again, my dear.
事实上  我没想到会看见  这么精彩的事012---In fact, I hardly expected to see so much.
你跟我说你什么也没看见  我跟你说过的事多的很012---You told me you didn't see anything.  I tell you a lot of things.
很高兴看到你重新振作起来  亲爱的012---Well, it's wonderful to have you up and about again, dear.
好好照顾自己012---Stay well.
这是今天第三次  有人对我说这种话012---That's the third time someone has said something like that to me today.
瑞秋  嗨012---Rach! Hi.
我的天啊  我结婚了  对啊012---Oh, my God, I'm married! I know!
我是巴瑞亨特法巴尔医师娘了012---I'm Mrs. Dr. Barry Hunter, hyphen, Farber.
我真以你为荣  敏012---I am so proud of you, Min.
敏012---Min.
瑞秋  你还在啊012---Oh, Rach. Still here.
上一次婚礼上  他们这时候正在打包碎鹅肝012---At our wedding, they were packing up the chopped liver about now.
真有趣的故事012---Yeah, I love that story.
我有个问题要问你们012---Ahem. I have a question for you guys.
为什么大家一直说  很高兴见到我重新振作起来012---Why do people keep saying it's good to see me up and about?
你逃婚后…012---After you ran out on your wedding...
巴瑞的父母告诉大家你…012---...Barry's parents told people you were sort of...
疯了012---...insane.
疯了  因为得了梅毒012---Insane?  From the syphilis.
什么012---What?
不然你要他们怎么说   你不爱我了  怎么可能012---What were they gonna say? You didn't love me anymore? Come on.
安琪拉012---Angela?
乔伊崔比亚尼012---Joey Tribbiani.
你今晚有事吗012---Listen, what are you doing tonight?
我知道你在跟那男人交往  也许你可以带他过来…012---I know you're seeing that guy. I was thinking maybe you could bring him...
喂   喂012---Hello? Hello?
你要回她吗  她已经叮咚你第十次了012---You gonna answer her? That's the 10th bing-bong message she's sent.
她想知道怎么回事  怎么回事  你结婚了012---She wants to know what's wrong. What's wrong? You're married!
就是这么回事012---That's what's wrong!
我的天啊012---Oh, my.
怎么了  她想跟你碰面012---What? She wants to meet you in person.
听着  菲比  我本来也很想跟她碰面012---Look, Phoebe, I wanted to meet her in person too.
但她结婚了  她有丈夫012---But she's married. She has a husband.
如果她丈夫不合适  而你才是合适的人呢012---What if the husband is the wrong guy and you are the right guy?
这种机会不是天天都有012---You don't get chances like this all the time.
如果你不跟她碰面  到80岁时  你会后悔得恨自己012---If you don't meet her, you'll kick yourself when you're 80...
而且这件事难度很高  你会因此跌断屁股012---...which is hard to do and that's how you break a hip.
好吧  我去见她012---Okay. I'll do it.
太好了  快穿鞋  然后走出去见她012---Okay, great! Put on your shoes and then march out there and meet her.
不  等等  你要先洗个澡  因为…012---No, wait! You have to take a shower because ew!
我去拿…012---And I'll get the...
不  你得先回她  先答应她012---No, you have to answer her. Answer her first.
不  去煮点咖啡  因为这太令人紧张了012---No, make some coffee because it's too much.
身材高大  棕褐色  年轻可爱012---Tall and tan, and young and lovely
好  拜托嘛  再一次  这次我一定丢中012---Okay, one more, please. I'm gonna get it in this time.
好  最后机会012---Okay, last chance.
再次感到抱歉012---Again, I'm sorry.
你知道吗   也许我不需要有小孩012---You know what, maybe I don't need to have children.
也许我只是这样认为  因为这个社会…012---Maybe I just think I do because that's what society...
也就是我妈012---...and by that I mean my mom...
总是说服我…012---...has always convinced me that I...
说我需要有小孩012---I do.
我一定要有小孩  很抱歉  但我真的很需要012---I have to have children. I'm sorry, I just do.
各位请注意012---Yo, could I have your attention?
伴郎要敬酒012---Best man making a toast here.

我还记得巴端与瑞秋  初次约会回家012---I remember when Barry got home from his first date with Rachel.
恩012---Huh?
怎么  你可以请了同一个乐团  我就不能用相同的演讲稿012---What? You hired the same band. I can't use the same speech?
谢谢  感谢各位012---Thank you. Thank you very much.
总而言之  祝两位…012---Anyway, I wish you both...
幸福美满012---...a wonderful life together. Aw.
还有  瑞秋012---And, Rachel.
什么事  不  我是百分之百认真的012---What? No, no, in all seriousness.
没有几个女人有胆量回到这里012---Not a lot of women would have the guts to come back here.
更别提光着屁股回来012---And even fewer who'd do it with their asses hanging out.
就这样012---That's it.
我想  啊  补充一下012---I'd like to add something to that.
补充什么…  没关系的  好的012---What are you adding? What are you adding?  It's okay. It's okay.
多数人不认得我  我是瑞秋的男友012---Most of you don't know me. I'm Rachel's boyfriend...
我的老天爷啊012---Oh, dear God.
罗斯012---...Ross.
我只想说…012---And I'd just like to say that...
今晚瑞秋鼓起很大的勇气前来012---...it did take a lot of courage for Rachel to come here tonight.
我要郑重声明…012---And just for the record...
她不是因为得了梅毒才逃婚012---...she did not run out on Barry because she had syphilis.
你在干嘛  我是认真的012---What are you doing? I'm serious.
她之所以逃婚…012---The reason...
很简单  是因为…012---...she walked out on Barry is simply that...
她不爱他012---...she didn't love him.
当然也意外的便宜了我012---Which, incidentally, worked out pretty well for me. Heh, heh.
干杯012---Cheers.
停车场见  不  瑞秋012---See you in the parking lot.  No, Rach.
她又逃了012---And once again, she is out of here!
好  谁赌九点四十五分012---Okay, who had 9:45? Hm?
嘿012---Heh.
你知道吗   巴  我不走了012---You know what, Bar? I'm not gonna leave.
也许我该走  但我不走012---I probably should, but I'm not.
我答应自己至少要全程参加  你其中一场婚礼012---I promised myself I'd make it through at least one of your weddings.
今晚  我只想撑过去…012---Tonight, all I wanted was to make it through this evening...
带着一点优雅与尊严012---...with a little bit of grace and dignity.
我想我们都希望当什么事都没有发生过012---Well, I guess we can all agree that's not gonna happen.
我想我也没什么话好说012---I guess there's nothing really left to say...
除了…012---...except...
她的名字叫萝拉012---Her name was Lola
她是歌舞女郎012---She was a showgirl
黄色羽毛012---With yellow feath...

谢谢你  亲爱的012---Thank you, honey.
还会跳恰恰012---And do the cha-cha
她想成为明星  汤尼总是看顾酒吧012---And while she'd like to be a star Tony always tended bar
等等012---Wait, wait!
大家一起唱012---Everybody!
科巴…012---Copa
