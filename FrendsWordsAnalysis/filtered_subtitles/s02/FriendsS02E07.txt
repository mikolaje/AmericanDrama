我是哪里不对  我看起来不够有趣吗012---Okay. What is it about me? Do I not look fun enough?
我是有哪里讨人厌吗012---Is there something repellent about me?
派对好玩吗012---How was the party?
糟透了 女人都把我当空气一样的穿过去012---It couldn't have been worse. A woman literally passed through me.
我真的那么无可救药的不吸引人吗012---So, what is it? Am I hideously unattractive?
才不会呢  你很有魅力啊012---No, you are not. You are very attractive.
我也是一样012---I go through the exact same thing.
每次我变胖时 我都会很没信心 东猜西想012---Every time I put on a little weight, I question everything.
哇  哇012---Whoa, whoa.
我变胖了012---I've put on a little weight?
你要不要…  对…012---Did you want to? Yeah, uh...
不是变胖  是变得更稳重012---No, not weight. More like insulation.
我现在没工作  我需要找件事做012---Chandler, I'm unemployed, in dire need of a project.
你要不要运动  我可以帮你打造全新的你012---Wanna work out? I can remake you.
我很想  但那样我便没时间懒散了012---Uh, I would, but that might get in the way of my lying-around time.
拜托嘛  好啦  让她帮你啦！012---Please?  Come on, let her do it!
好吧  但穿上紧身衣之后012---All right. But if we put on spandex...
若我的胸部比你大就免谈012---...and my boobs are bigger than yours, I'm going home.
你的胸部不大啦  我真是大嘴巴  过来012---Your boobs are fine. Look, I never should have said anything. Come here. Come here!
两只手合抱不起来012---Ooh, can't make hands meet!
《老友记》 第二季 第7集: 真相大白012---Friends S02E07: The One Where Ross Finds Out
好  开始吧012---Okay! Let's do it.
怎样012---What?
没事  只是没看过你穿紧身裤012---Nothing. Just never seen you in little stretchy pants before.
我去换衣服012---And we're changing.
加油  再来五次012---Unh!  Come on, give me five more!  Ugh. Aah!
再五次  不要012---Five more! No.
再做五次 就给你看我的胸部012---Five more and I'll flash you.
一...012---One...

哦  哦  哦  哦  哦012---Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow.
她疯了 那女人疯了012---She's insane! The woman is insane.
上班前  下班后  甚至上班时012---It's before work, after work, and during work.
她要我在办公桌前练缩臀012---She's got me doing butt-clenches at my desk.
现在  他们不再送邮件给我了012---And now they won't bring me my mail anymore.
菲比  和史考特约会进行如何012---Hey, Pheebs. How'd it go with Scott?
很不错  去了一家很浪漫的餐厅…012---Oh, um, it was nice. Took him to a romantic restaurant...
点香槟喝  还不错012---...ordered champagne. Nice.
还是没搞头  没有  完全没搞头012---The guy still won't put out? Nope. Zilch. Nothing. Uh-uh.
真遗憾  菲比  真遗憾  菲比012---Sorry, Pheebs.  Sorry, Pheebs.
我不介意慢慢来  我很喜欢他012---Well, look, I don't mind taking it slow. I like him a lot.
他很风趣又很体贴012---He's really interesting, and he's really sweet.
他干嘛不肯放开矜持012---Why won't he give it up?
搞不好他是〝另外一边的〞012---Maybe he, uh, drives his car on the other side of the road.
你晓得我的意思…012---If you know what I mean.
我不懂  什么意思  他又不是英国人012---No. What do you mean? He's not British.
或许他是同志012---Maybe he's gay. Oh!
我觉得不太可能012---Um, no, I don't think that's the problem.
我们前几天去跳舞…012---We went, um, dancing the other night...
…他紧紧抱住我的那个样子  还有他凝视我眼睛的样子…012---...and just the way he held me so close and the way he was looking into my eyes...
让我真的有触电的感觉012---...I just definitely felt something.
但是眼神能看出什么呢012---Yeah, but how much can you tell from a look?
不  我是从屁股感觉到的012---No, I felt it on my hip. I could tell.
哟  宾  二十分钟后去打壁球012---Yo, Bing! Racquetball in 20 minutes.
乔伊  行行好  把我的手抬起来揍她一拳012---Joey, be a pal. Lift up my hand and smack her with it. Heh.
喔  瑞秋  别看  什么012---Ooh. Oh, Rachel! Don't look. What?
拜托  我才不在乎  我今晚有约会呢012---Come on, guys. I don't care. I have a date tonight.
你有约会  摩妮卡帮我介绍的012---Whoa, whoa, whoa. You have a date? Yeah. Monica's setting me up.
那罗斯和…012---Heh, now, what about, uh, Ross and...
什么  我很爱乱吃醋的事吗012---What? My whole insane jealousy thing?
虽然这整件事还挺有趣的...012---Well, you know, as much fun as that was...
我决定还是好好过日子012---...I've decided to opt for sanity.
你真的不介意那些了012---So you're okay about all this?
喔  当然 少来了  我还要过我的日子呢012---Oh, yeah, come on! I'm moving on.
他爱怎么把她压在那扇窗子上就怎么压吧012---He can press her up against that window as much as he wants.
与我无关  他干脆把她摔过那该死的窗子算了012---For all I care, he can throw her through the damn thing.
嗨  各位  嘿012---Hi, guys.Hey.
摩妮卡  我明早过来拿毛毛的玩具012---Monica, I figured I'd come by tomorrow and pick up Fluffy's old cat toys, okay?
你得说出他的全名才行012---Only if you say his full name.
我明天是否能过来拿喵毛毛的旧玩具012---Can I come over tomorrow and pick up Fluffy Meowington's cat toys?
好的  你要养猫012---All right. You're getting a cat?
事实上  是我们要养的012---Actually, we're getting a cat. Heh.
一起012---Together? Uh-huh.
你们俩  一起   对012---Both of you? Together? Yup.
他一半时间和我住  一半时间和他住012---It'll live with Ross half the time and me half the time.
喔…012---Oh, well...
可真幸福 很棒012---...isn't that just lovely? Ha, ha.
你们俩将可以…012---That's something the two of you will be able to enjoy...
享受这种感觉好长好长一段时间呢012---...for a really, really, really long time.
希望如此012---Hopefully.Oh, wow.
哎呀  我得走了  我要去约会呢012---Whoa! Look at that. I gotta go! I got a date!
和男人约会 好吧012---With a man. Ahem, okay.
祝你们大家晚安…012---You guys have a really, uh, good night...
祝你们两个得到一只好猫012---...and you two have a, uh, really good cat. Heh.
离开店时不能把这拿走的012---We're not supposed to take these when we leave.
我不晓得摩妮卡有没有告诉你  这是我离婚之后第一次约会012---I don't know if Monica told you... ...but this the first date I've gone on since my divorce.
我或许有点紧张  事实上我是的012---So if I seem a little nervous... ...I am.
猫能活多久012---How long do cats live?
什么  猫通常能活几年012---I'm sorry? Cats. How long do they live?
如果不是把他们丢到巴士底下的话…012---Figuring you don't throw them under a bus or something?
大概十五  六年吧   那可真好啊012---Um, maybe 15, 16 years. Well, that's just great.
干杯012---Um, cheers. Mm.
是啊…当012---Right. Clink. Heh.
摩妮卡把我形容得比本人帅  是吧012---Monica told you I was cuter than this, didn't she?
噢  不  麦可 和你没关系…012---Oh, no, Michael, it's not you.
对不起  是这样的…012---Sorry. It's just... It's this thing.
或许听起来很奇怪…012---It's probably not as bad as it sounds...
但我有个朋友和他的女朋友正打算养一只猫012---...but this friend of mine is getting a cat with his girlfriend.
喔  那的确是…012---Oh, that does sound...
他才刚和她交往012---Huh. He just started going out with her.
他是你前任男友吗012---Ahem. Is this guy, uh, an old boyfriend?
他想得美喔012---Yeah, he wishes.
对不起  你瞧瞧我012---Oh, I'm sorry. Look at me.
麦可  谈谈你吧012---Okay, Michael, let's talk about you.
好的  好的012---All right. Okay. Okay?
所以…012---So...
你曾经和女友一起养过宠物吗012---Did you ever get a pet with a girlfriend?
我明白怎么回事情了  什么012---So I figured it out.  What?
为什么史考特不想和我上床012---Why Scott doesn't want to sleep with me.
因为我不够性感012---'Cause I'm not sexy enough.
菲比  那太扯了吧012---Heh, Phoebe, that's crazy.
我刚认识你时  你知道我怎么对钱德说的吗012---When I first met you, you know what I said to Chandler?
我说“前突后翘 有看头”012---Mm-mm. I said, "Excellent butt, great rack."
真的吗  你真好012---Really? That's so sweet.
我觉得被冒犯 可是感觉真好012---I mean, I'm officially offended. But that's so sweet.
如果你真想知道实情  你得亲自问他012---Look, if you wanna know what the deal is, you're gonna have to ask him.
你说得对  没错012---You're right. You're right.
你好可爱喔012---Ugh, you are so yum!
只不过是一只猫  你知道  只是只猫012---I mean, it's a cat, you know? It's a cat.
他们干嘛不养虫子  养果蝇嘛012---Why can't they get one of those bugs? One of those fruit flies.
那种只活一天的  叫什么来着012---Those things that live for a day. What are they called? What are they called?
果蝇  没错012---Fruit flies?  Yes!
谢谢你  你们要吃甜点吗012---Thank you. Would you like any dessert?
不要  不要甜点012---No! No dessert.
我们要买单  拜托012---Just the check. Please.
喔  糟糕  和我约会很不好玩吧012---Oh, no. You're not having fun, are you?
不  不  很好玩…012---No, no, I am.
不过刚才那一个半小时我都在回忆“餐馆”的情节012---but only because for the last hour and a half I've been playing the movie Diner in my head.
喔  我真是的…012---Oh, look at me.
瞧瞧我012---Look at me.
我正在和一个很棒的男人约会…012---Oh, I'm on a date with a really great guy.
我心里却只想着罗斯和他的猫…012---All I can think about is Ross... ...and his cat...
还有他的茱莉012---...and his Julie.
我只想忘了他  为什么我办不到呢012---I just want to get over him. God, why can't I do that?
喔012---Oy.
我离过婚  相信我  你会没事的012---Look, I've been through a divorce. Trust me, you're gonna be fine.
你只是心结未解012---You can't see it because you haven't had closure...
啊012---Aah!
解开心结012---Closure!
这就对了  那正是我需要的012---That's what it is. That's what I need.
老天  你真聪明012---God, you're brilliant!
我为什么之前没想到   要如何解开心结呢012---Why didn't I think of that? How do I get that?
并没有绝对的可行办法012---Well, there's no one way really, it's just...
有各种不同的办法  好让你对他说…012---Whatever it takes so that you can finally say to him:
我不在乎你了012---"I'm over you."
不在乎你012---Over you.
那正是关键012---That's what it is.
解开心结012---Closure.
哈罗…对不起…012---Hello? Excuse me?
对不起…哎唷…012---Excuse me. Hel... Whoo!
等等  对不起…012---Hang on.  Hello? Excuse me?
干嘛   嗨…抱歉…012---What? Hi. I'm sorry.
电话借我一分钟012---I need to borrow your phone for just one minute.
我正在讲电话  我看得出来012---I'm talking.  I see that.
我打一个电话  就可以了很快的  我可以付你钱012---It's one phone call, I'll be very quick. I'll even pay for it myself.
你有点小气喔  不肯借人电话012---Okay, you're being a little weird about your phone.
好吧012---All right. Fine.
好  我再打给你012---I'll call you back.
谢谢012---Thank you.
好012---Okay.
是答录机012---Machine.
等哔声过后就可以讲    那很好012---Just waiting for the beep.  Good.
罗斯  嗨  是我  瑞秋012---Ross! Hi, it's Rachel.
我打电话来要告诉你…012---I'm just calling to say that, um...
一切都很好  我很为你高兴012---...everything's fine. And I'm really happy for you...
还有你的猫012---...and your cat.
还有  你应该给你的猫取名叫麦可012---Who, by the way, I think you should name Michael.
瞧  我连名字都想好了…012---And you see there, I'm thinking of names...
显然我不在乎你了012---...so obviously I am over you.
我不在乎你了012---I am over you.
这就是我那位朋友所谓的〝解开心结〞012---And that, my friend, is what they call "closure."
不  不  不  不  不  不012---No, no, no, no, no, no.
不012---No!
今天是星期天  我星期天不跑步012---Monica, it's Sunday morning. I'm not running on a Sunday.
为什么   因为是星期天012---Why not?  Because it's Sunday!
是上帝叫人休息的日子012---It's God's day.
嘿  只要你想停  我们就停012---Ha, hey. If you say stop, then we stop.
好012---Ha, ha, okay.
停012---Stop.
不行  不能停啊  还有三磅要减012---No, come on! We can't stop! We got three more pounds to go!
我是精力充沛的火车而你在车上012---I am the energy train and you are on board
唔012---Whoo.
嘿  瑞秋…012---Hey, Rach. Mm.
约会约得如何012---Oh. And how was the date? Ugh.
我记得去了一间餐厅…012---Um, I think there was a restaurant.
我知道我喝了酒012---I know there was wine.
嗯…012---Wow. Well, uh...
呃  菜莉在楼下招计程车…012---Uh, actually, Julie's getting a cab.
我上来拿猫玩具  摩妮卡有没有说012---I just need the cat toys. Did Monica say?
你为什么那样看我012---What? Why are you looking at me like that? Heh.
对不起  我不晓得  我…012---Ahem, I'm sorry. I don't know, I...
我好像梦到了你…012---I feel like I had a dream about you last night...
但我不记得了012---...but I don't remember.
好吧012---Okay. Heh.
噢…在那里012---Oh, oh, oh. There they are. Ahem.
我们昨晚有讲电话吗  你是不是打给我012---Did we speak on the phone? Did you call me?
没有  我昨晚在茱莉那里过夜012---No. I stayed at Julie's last night.
我根本还没回家呢  介意我听一下留言吗012---Huh. - Oh, I haven't even been home yet. Do you mind if I check my messages?
喔  好啊  你查012---Oh, yeah, go ahead.
瑞秋  我有一通你的留言012---Rach, I got a message from you!
谁是麦可  喔  老天012---Who's Michael?  Oh, my God.
罗斯  不要  挂断电话  电话给我…012---God, Ross, no! Hang up the phone. Give me the phone!...
电话给我…012---Give me the...
你已经不在乎我了012---You're over me?

你喜欢我012---You've had feelings for me?
那又怎样  是你先喜欢我的012---Yeah, so? You had feelings for me first. Whoa, huh.
你知道我… 你知道我从前…012---You know about my...? You know I had...?
你知道012---You know?
钱德告诉我了  他什么时候讲的 他012---Chandler told me. When did he...? When did he...? When did he?
你去中国…  中国012---When you were in China.  China.
遇见茱莉的时候  菜莉012---Meeting Julie.  Julie.
茱莉  这… 喔  老天012---Julie. That's... Oh, God.
茱莉…对喔012---Julie? Julie, right.
好  我必须躺下012---Okay, I need to lie down.
不  我要站着  我得站着…  好012---No, I'm gonna stand. I'm gonna stand... Okay.
我还要走动一下 我要踱步我踱步012---...and I'm gonna walk. I'm walking and I am standing.
所以你…012---Okay, so you, uh?
现在  现在…012---And now, what? Now...? Now.
现在你不在乎我了012---Now you're over me?
你还在乎我吗012---Are you over me?
是茱莉…茱莉012---That's... That's Julie. That's Julie. Julie.
嗨  茱莉  甜心  计程车在等喔012---Hi, Julie. Honey, I've got a cab waiting.
我马上下来012---I'll be right down!
等等  你要走了012---Wait, so you're going?
我得走  我现在没办法处理这件事012---Well, okay, I, uh... I have to. I can't deal with this right now.
计程车在等我  我有个女朋友012---I mean, I've, uh... Heh. You know, I've got a cab. I've got a girlfriend.
我还要去领养一只猫012---I'm gonna go get a cat.
好012---Okay. Okay.
猫012---Cat!
嘿   乔伊  嘿  菲比012---Hey, Joey.  Hey, Pheebs.
你干嘛看犹太牧师弹电吉他012---How come you're watching a rabbi play electric guitar?
我找不到摇控器012---I can't find the remote.
谢谢你012---Ugh, thank you. Heh.
史考特找我去他家吃午餐  我去了012---So, Scott asked me to come over for lunch and I did.
然后呢  我们做了012---And? And we did.
好耶  太棒了  菲比   我好棒012---All right, Pheebs! Way to go! Yay, me. Ha, ha.
怎么发生的012---So how did it happen?
我听了你的建议  问他到底怎么回事啊012---I finally took your advice and asked him what was going on.
他怎么说  他说…012---What did he say?  He said that...
他知道女人对性特别感情用事012---...he understands how sex can be a very emotional thing for a woman.
他之前是怕我会胡思乱想…012---And he was just afraid that I was going to get all, you know:
担心他隔天会不会打电话  和他有没有未来012---"Is he gonna call me the next day?" And "Where is this going?" and:
他说他想等到他准备好定下来才做那件事012---So he said he wanted to hold off until he was prepared to be serious.
是啊  结果我便劝他…012---Yeah. So I said,
别紧张  放轻松…012---"Okay. Relax, please." You know?
性有可能只是一时干柴烈火的反应012---I mean, sex can be just about two people right there in the moment.
如果他想再和我约会  他再打来没关系  不打也没关系012---If he wants to see me again, he can call. If not, that's fine too.
结果我们谈了很久…012---So after a lot of talking, heh...
最后我说服他了012---...I convinced him. Heh!
让我把这件事搞清楚  他让你去求他上床012---Let me get this straight. He got you to beg to sleep with him.
他让你自己开口说  他不用打电话给你012---He got you to say he never has to call you again.
他还让你认为这是个好主意012---And he got you thinking this is a great idea?
嗯-哼012---Uh-huh.
这个家伙真的是我的偶像012---This man is my god.
晚安012---Good night.
嗨  我没领养猫012---Hi. I didn't get a cat.
喔  这下可有意思了012---Oh, that's, um, interesting.
不  一点也没有意思  非常没意思012---No. No, it's not interesting. Okay? It's very, very not interesting.
事实上一点意思都没有012---It's actually a hundred percent the opposite of interesting.
我懂了  罗斯012---I got it, Ross.
你无权告诉我你曾经喜欢过我012---You had no right to tell me you ever had feelings for me.
什么  在我发现之前我过得好好的012---What?  I was doing great with Julie before I found out about you.
在我发现之前我也过得好好的！012---I was doing great before I found out about you!
看到你和茱莉在一起  我心里好受吗012---You think it's easy for me to see you with Julie?
你应该在我认识她之前说出来012---You should've said something before I met her.
那时我不知道啊  那你为何从不说什么呢012---I didn't know then. And how come you never said anything to me?
因为总没有机会012---There was never a good time.
你有一整年的时间  我们还每晚都一起混012---You only had a year. And we only hung out every night!
不是…不是012---Not... Not... Not...
每个晚上012---...every night.
不是我没尝试  每次都有事情发生012---It's not like I didn't try. But things got in the way.
像那些意大利男人  还有前任未婚夫…012---You know, like Italian guys... ...or ex-fiancés, or... Or... Or...
还有那些意大利男人012---Italian guys.
只有一个意大利男人 你的重点是012---There was one Italian guy, okay? And do you have a point?
重点是  我现在没办法处理这件事012---The point is, I don't need this right now!
好吧  已经太迟了012---Okay? It's too late.
我身边已经有人 我很快乐这艘船开航了012---I'm with somebody else. I'm happy. This ship has sailed!
你喜欢什么时候抛开感情都可以吗012---You're just gonna put away feelings or whatever it was you felt for me?
