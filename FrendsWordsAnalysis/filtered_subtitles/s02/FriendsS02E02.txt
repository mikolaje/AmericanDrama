你要跟茱莉去布鲁明戴尔012---You're going to Bloomingdale's with Julie.
这就像到瑞秋家中偷汉子012---It's like cheating on Rachel in her house of worship.
但是我…  摩妮卡  她会宰了你012---But I... Monica, she will kill you.
她会宰了你  像宰流浪狗一样012---She will kill you like a dog in the street!
茱莉跟我说你们明天要一起去购物012---So, uh, Jules tells me you guys are going shopping tomorrow.
其实没什么大不了的  其实…012---Yeah, um, it's actually not that big a deal. In fact...

好  我吃了什么012---All right. What did I have?
你吃沙拉   难怪我还觉得饿012---You had a salad. No wonder I don't feel full.

你去买皮草    对012---You went shopping for fur? Yeah.
然后我发现我反对买皮草012---And then I realized that I'm against that and, um...
所以我们买了一些…012---So then we bought some, um...
胸部012---Um, boobs.
你买了胸部012---You bought boobs?
胸罩啦012---Bras!

卡萝  我们已经谈过这件事了  我们玩得很开心012---We've been through this before. We have a good time.
我们又笑又玩  就像父亲跟儿子一样012---We laugh, we play. It's like we're father and son.
亲爱的  别担心  罗斯很会照顾他012---Honey, relax. Ross is great with him.
别这么惊讶  我是个和善的人012---Don't look so surprised. I'm a lovely person.
噢  这好可爱012---Oh, this is so cute.
我帮他买的012---Ah, I got that for him!
〝我的妈妈们爱我〞012---"My Mommies Love Me."
真聪明012---That's clever.
喂012---Hello?

嗨  朱012---Hi, Jew!
好啊  当然012---Uh-huh. Okay, um, sure.
太好了  到时候见  拜012---That'd be great. See you then. Bye.
你刚刚说〝嗨  朱〞吗012---Did you just say, "Hi, Jew"?
对  没错012---Yes. Um, yes, I did.
刚刚是我的〝猪〞朋狗友打来的012---That was my friend Eddie Moskowitz.
他喜欢我这样叫他  好笑嘛012---Yeah, he likes it. Reaffirms his faith.
班  吃晚餐了012---Ben, dinner!
谢了  菲比阿姨012---Thanks, Aunt Pheebs.
你不是用微波的吧  母奶不可以用微波的012---You didn't microwave that, did you? It's breast milk, you're not supposed to.
我知道怎么加热母奶012---Duh, I think I know how to heat breast milk. Heh.
好012---Okay.
你刚刚做了什么012---What did you just do?
我舔了手臂啊  干嘛012---I licked my arm, what?
是母奶耶012---It's breast milk!
那又怎样012---So?
菲比  那是人身上挤出来的奶012---Phoebe, that is juice squeezed from a person.
那又怎样   不…012---What is the big deal? No, no...
你做了什么好事012---What did you just do?
你们可以不要再喝母奶了吗012---Can people stop drinking the breast milk?
你连尝尝看都不肯  不要012---You won't even taste it? - No.
连假装它是牛奶都不行吗012---Not even if you just pretend it's milk?
就算卡萝的乳房贴了寻人启事都不行012---Not even if Carol's breast had a picture of a missing child on it.
嘿   嗨012---Hey. Hi.
大家都去哪了  带小班去公园玩012---Where is everybody?  Took Ben to the park.
你去哪了   出去一下012---Where have you been?  Just out.
吃了午餐  只有我一个人与自己共度的美好时光012---Had some lunch. Just me. A little quality time with me.
谢谢你的外套  噢  没问题012---Hey, thanks for your jacket. Oh, no problem.
你也可以向我借012---You can borrow it, by the way. Heh.
你的钥匙在这里   谢谢012---Oh, here are your keys, honey. Thank you.
摩妮卡012---Mon? Mm-hmm?
如果你是一个人吃午餐  怎么会花了五十三块012---If, uh, you were at lunch alone, how come it cost you $53?
你知道发生什么事吗012---You know what probably happened?
大概有人偷了我的信用卡012---Someone must have stolen my credit card. Ah.
然后把帐单放回你的口袋012---And put the receipt back in your pocket?
这是个很棒的问题  很棒012---Huh. That is an excellent, excellent question.
太棒了012---That is excellent.
你怎么了  你跟谁一起吃午餐012---What's with you? Who did you have lunch with?
茱蒂  谁012---Judy. Who?
茱莉 乔蒂   什么012---Julie. Jody? What?
你跟茱莉出去  听着012---You were with Julie? Mm. Look.
一开始  我只是想对她好一点…012---When it started, I was just trying to be nice to her...
因为她是我哥的女朋友012---...because she was my brother's girlfriend.
然后事情接着发生…012---And then one thing led to another...
在我搞清楚之前… 我们就…012---...and before I knew it, we were...
一起购物了012---...shopping. Aah.
天啊012---Oh, my God.
等等  我们只做了一次012---Wait, we only did it once.
对我一点意义也没有012---It didn't mean anything to me.
是啊  是真的012---Yeah, right. Sure. Really!
瑞秋  我心里想的都是你012---Rachel, I was thinking of you the whole time.
听着  我真的很抱歉  好吗  我从来都不想让你发现012---Look, I'm sorry, all right? I never meant for you to find out.
拜托  你很想被逮到012---Oh, please! Please! You wanted to get caught!
乱讲012---That is not true!
所以你是不小心把收据留在这里012---So you just happened to leave it in here?
你有没有想过我或许就是那么笨012---Did it ever occur to you that I might just be that stupid?
好  摩妮卡  我需要知道一件事012---Okay, Monica, I just have to know one thing.
你有跟她一起去布鲁明戴尔吗012---Did you go with her to Bloomingdale's?
好…012---Okay. Okay.
好  我只是  我现在无法跟你在一起012---Okay, I just really, um... I just need to not be with you right now.
喂  哪一位012---Hi, who's this?
嗨  乔安  瑞秋有上班吗  我是摩妮卡012---Hi, Joanne. Is Rachel working? It's Monica.
我知道我做了很糟糕的事012---Yes, I know I did a horrible thing.
乔安  事情不是那么简单012---Joanne, it's not as simple as all that, okay?
不  我不在乎史提夫怎么想的  嗨  史提夫012---No, I don't care what Steve thinks. Hi, Steve.
嘿   嗨！012---Hey! Hi!
做得怎样啊012---How did we do?
我尝了小班的母奶  罗斯吓坏了012---Oh, I tasted Ben's milk and Ross freaked out.
我没有吓坏012---I... I did not freak out.
为什么你会吓坏   因为那是母奶012---Why'd you freak out?  Because it's breast milk.
超恶心的012---It's gross!
我的母奶很恶心012---My breast milk is gross?
有趣了012---This should be fun.
不是  卡萝  你的母奶没有问题012---No, Carol. There's nothing wrong with it.
我只是觉得母奶不是成人喝的012---I just don't think breast milk is for adults.
当然  母奶的包装大人小孩都喜欢012---Of course, the packaging does appeal to grownups and kids.
罗斯  别傻了  我试过了  这没什么012---Ross, you're being silly. I've tried it. It's no big deal.
来嘛  尝一点012---Come on, just taste it.Ha-ha-ha.
我不要012---That would be no.
别这样  试试看012---Come on. Try it.
是天然的  味道不错啊012---It's natural.  It doesn't taste bad.
喝起来甜甜的 有点像…012---Yeah, it tastes kind of sweet. Sort of like, uh...
像什么   哈蜜瓜汁012---Like what?  Cantaloupe juice.
没错012---Exactly.
你有喝过012---You've tasted it.
你有喝过012---You've tasted it.
噢  你有喝过012---Oh, you've tasted it.
你可以一直说  但这句话也不会变成假的012---You can keep saying it, but it won't stop being true.
瓶子给我012---Give me the bottle.
毛巾给我012---Get me the towel.
你好啊012---Howdy.
给我一瓶果汁012---Give me a box ofjuice.
他们把我换到原野奇侠012---Well, they switched me over to Hombre.
或许是因为你的打扮012---Maybe it's because of the way you're dressed.
又或许是因为这家伙很厉害  他们要增加人手012---Or maybe this guy's doing so good they want to put more people on it.
你该看看这家伙  他现在一天可以用掉两瓶012---This guy goes through two bottles a day now.
你在乎什么012---What do you care?
你是演员  这只是你的副业  没什么大不了012---You're an actor. This is your day job. Isn't supposed to mean anything.
我知道  但我以前是最棒的012---I know, but I was the best.
我喜欢当最厉害的那个人012---You know? I liked being the best.
不知道  或许我该退出了012---Maybe I should get out of the game.
厨具部门需要有人切乳酪012---They need guys up in housewares to serve cheese.
假如你这么做了012---Say you do that.
迟早有人乳酪会切得比你好012---Sooner or later, somebody will come along that slices a better cheddar.
到时候你要逃到哪里去012---And then where you gonna run?
你说得没错  我当然是对的012---I guess you're right.  Damn right I'm right.
你让这家伙看看你的能耐  捍卫你的领土012---Show this guy what you're made of. Stand your ground.
让他知道你是内衣部西边最厉害的原野奇侠012---Show him that you're the baddest Hombre west of the lingerie!
我这就去  好！012---I'm gonna do it!  All right!
现在去找猫咪小姐  她会介绍个好妓女给你012---Now, go see Miss Kitty and she'll fix you up with a nice hooker.
我不知道还能说什么012---MONICA: I don't know what to say.
很好  因为我根本没在听012---That works good because I'm not listening.
我觉得糟透了  真的012---I feel terrible. I really do.
噢  抱歉  我的背伤到你的刀吗012---Oh, I'm sorry. Did my back hurt your knife?
瑞秋012---Rachel!
我跟她交朋友  一起去逛街012---Say that I'm friends with her. We spend time together.
有那么糟吗   对012---Is that so terrible?  Yes.
有那么糟   是的 摩妮卡 你根本不懂012---It's that terrible?  Yes, Monica! You don't get it.
她偷走我的男人已经够糟了012---It's bad enough she stole the guy...
一个我可能会长相厮守的男人012---...who may be the person I'm supposed to be with.
但是现在…012---But now...
她竟然…012---...she's actually...
她竟然连你也抢走了！012---But now she's actually stealing you!
我012---Me?
你在说什么012---What are you talking about?
没人能把我从你那里抢走012---Nobody could steal me from you.
我跟她交朋友不会影响你跟我的感情012---Because I'm friends with her doesn't make me any less friends with you.
亲爱的012---Honey.
你是我…012---I mean, you're my...
我们…012---And we're...
噢  我爱你  我也爱你！012---Oh, I love you!  I love you too!
两位  我知道这跟我一点关系都没有012---You guys, um, I know that this really doesn't have anything to do with me.
但我也好爱你们012---But, um, I love you guys too!
我真的很需要纸巾012---Ugh, I really needed that.
我知道你现在的情况…012---Look, I know you're in a place right now...
让你很讨厌茱莉012---...where you really need to hate Julie's guts.
但是她并没有做错任何事012---But she didn't do anything wrong.
她只是认识了一个男生  现在他们在交往012---She's just a girl who met a guy, and now they go out.
如果你给她点机会  你也会喜欢她的012---I think that if you gave her a chance, you'd like her.
你愿意给她一个机会吗012---Will you give that a chance?
就为了我012---For me?
我愿意为你做任何事  你知道的012---I'd do anything for you, you know that.
我愿意为你做任何事012---I'd do anything for you!
等等…012---Wait, wait, wait, wait!
早安012---Morning.
我说了  早安012---Heh. I said, morning.
我听到了012---I heard you.
好吧  各位  我要开门了012---All right, everybody. I'm opening the doors.
你们准备好了吗012---You boys ready?
好了012---Ready.
我准备好了012---Yeah, I'm ready.
你这白痴  白痴牛仔012---You idiot! You stupid cowboy!
你害我看不到了  我要告你012---You've blinded me! I'm suing!
天啊  陶德  你干了什么好事012---Oh, my God! Todd! What the hell did you do?
对不起  我真是笨手笨脚012---I'm sorry. I'm such a doofus!
我真的很抱歉012---I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.
天啊  发生什么事了012---My God, what happened?
这些菜鸟都待不久012---Eh, these new kids, they never last.
他们迟早都会…012---Sooner or later they all...
不再久留012---...stop lasting.
不如我现在就请你喝杯咖啡如何012---Listen, uh, what do you say I buy you that cup of coffee now?
好啊012---Sure.
那么… 那么…012---So.  So.
我想说我们两个人应该多多亲近012---I just thought the two of us should hang out a bit.
你知道  我们没有真的好好谈过012---I mean, you know, we've never really talked.
我想你也知道 毕竟你也是当事人之一012---I guess you'd know that, being one of the two of us. Ha, ha, right?
我知道012---I know.  Mm.
我大概不该跟你讲这个…012---I probably shouldn't even tell you this...
但是我还蛮怕你的012---...but I'm pretty much totally intimidated by you.
真的吗  怕我012---Really? Me?
天啊  开什么玩笑012---Oh, my God, are you kidding?
罗斯超迷恋你的…012---Ross is so crazy about you...
我真的很希望你能喜欢我  我又…012---...and I really wanted you to like me, and I...
大概只是我自己乱想吧…012---It's probably me just being totally paranoid...
我觉得你好像不想喜欢我012---...but I kind of got the feeling that maybe you don't.
嗯…012---Well...
你并不是在乱想012---...you're not totally paranoid.
好012---Okay. Um...
天啊012---God. Um... - Heh.
你跟罗斯一开始交往的时候…012---When you and, uh, Ross first started going out...
我真的很难过012---...it was really hard for me, um...
有很多原因  细节就不多说了012---...for many reasons of which I'm not gonna bore you with now, but, um...
我看到他很快乐  你们两个人很相配012---I see how happy he is and how good you guys are together.
而且摩妮卡老是说你人很好…012---And, um, Monica's always saying how nice you are...
我真讨厌她是对的012---...and God, I hate it when she's right.
谢谢  嗯012---Thanks.  Yeah.
嘿  你会想要偶尔一起去看点电影吗012---Listen. Would you like to go to a movie sometime or something?
好啊  那会很棒   是吗012---Yeah, that'd be great. I'd love it.  Yeah?
我也会喜欢   好012---I'd love it too. Okay. Okay.

晚点再聊了  好  茱莉012---So I'll talk to you later.  All right, Julie.
拜  拜012---Bye.  Bye.
真是个会玩弄人的贱人012---What a manipulative bitch.
还不赖嘛012---It's not bad.
