妈  你别紧张好吗012---Mom, would you relax?
那里离这有十条街远  而且那女子是夜间落单012---That was 10 blocks from here, and the woman was walking alone at night.
我才不会那样012---I would never do that.
妈  拜托  你别担心了012---Mom, come on, stop worrying.
这条街很安全  这栋大楼很安全  没什么…012---This is a safe street. This is a safe building. There's nothing...
喔  天啊  你怎么飞进来的012---Aah! Oh, my God! What are you doing in here?
妈  我得挂电话了012---Mom, I gotta go. I gotta go.
天啊012---Oh, my God.
好012---Okay.
没问题  你尽管看报纸012---That's fine, you just read the paper.
我去拿个锅子012---I'm gonna get a pot.
不是给你用的012---It's not for you.
没问题  很好012---Okay, that's fine.
看看《家庭马戏团》的漫画…012---Read the Family Circus...
享受温馨的喜剧012---...enjoy the gentle comedy...
喔  天啊… 喔  天啊012---Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
哦  噢  老天  噢  老天012---Ugh. Oh, God. Oh, God.
门没关012---It's open, you guys.
嗨   嗨  有什么事吗012---Hi.  Hi. Can I help you?
我找菲比  她还住在这里吗012---I'm looking for Phoebe, does she still live here?
她不住这了  但我可以传话012---Uh, no, she doesn't. But I can get a message to her.
太棒了  就跟她说她的老公来过012---Great. Uh, just tell her her husband stopped by.
她的什么012---Her what? Aah!
嘿  你怎么办到的012---Hey, how did you do that?
《老友记》  第二季  第4集  菲比的老公012---Friends S02E04: The One With Phoebe's Husband
这太扯了  菲比  你怎么可能已经结婚了012---This is unbelievable, Pheebs. How can you be married?
我没有〝真正〞结婚012---I'm not "married" married, you know?
他是个朋友  还是个同志…012---He was just a friend, and he's gay...
他是加拿大人  需要绿卡012---...and he was from Canada, and he needed a Green Card.
我真不敢相信你嫁给邓肯012---I can't believe you married Duncan.
你怎么没告诉我   我们是无话不说的姊妹淘012---I mean, how could you not tell me? We lived together, we told each other everything.
对不起  但如果我跟你说  你就会批评012---I'm sorry, Monica, but I knew if I told you, you'd get really, like, judgmental...
也不会赞同的  我当然不会赞同012---...and would not approve. Of course I wouldn't approve.
你彻底爱上一个同志了012---You were totally in love with this guy who, hello, was gay.
你到底怎么想的012---I mean, what the hell were you thinking?
好残忍的批评啊012---See? And you thought she'd be judgmental.
我没跟他谈恋爱  我只是帮一个朋友012---Okay, I wasn't in love with him. I was just helping out a friend.
他离开后  你失魂落魄一个月012---Please. When he left town, you stayed in your pajamas for a month.
而且我看到你还吃了一个起司汉堡012---And I saw you eat a cheeseburger.
难道你没有吗012---Well, didn't you?
可能有吧012---I might have.
我真不敢相信你没告诉我012---I can't believe you didn't tell me.
难道你有对我坦白一切    我有什么隐瞒你012---Come on. Like you tell me everything? What have I not told you?
我不知道012---Ooh, I don't know. Um...
比如说电线杆上的内衣是你的012---...how about the fact that the underwear out there on the telephone pole is yours...
因为你跟巴比在阳台上做爱012---...from when you were having sex with Fun Bobby on the terrace.
什么   是谁告诉你的012---What?   Wait a minute. Who told you?
你死定了012---You are dead meat.
我不知道那是个大秘密012---I didn't know it was a big secret.
喔  没什么大不了  没关系012---Oh, it's not big. Not at all.
那有点像…012---You know, kind of on the same lines as, say
就好像… 有人有第三个奶头一样012---I don't know, having a third nipple.
你有三个奶头012---You have a third nipple?
你这个烂人012---You bitch.
我要看  我要看  对啊012---Whip it out. Whip it out. Yeah, yeah.
没什么好看的 只是很小的突出  没什么作用012---No, come on. There's nothing to see. It's just a tiny bump. It's totally useless.
难道你其他的奶头就有作用012---Oh, as opposed to your other multifunctional nipples?
我不敢相信  你跟我说那只是个肿块012---I can't believe you. You told me it was a nubbin.
乔伊  你认为肿块是什么样子012---Joey, what did you think a nubbin was?
我不知道  他那样说我就信了012---I don't know. You see something, you hear a word, I thought that's what it was.
让我再看一次   没错  我们要看012---Let me see it again. Yeah, show us your nubbin.
乔伊演过色情片012---Joey was in a porno movie.
我死的话  也要拖大家下水012---If I'm going down, I'm taking everybody with me.
我的妈呀  你演过色情片012---Oh, my God.You were in a porno?
那是年轻时候  我只想要份工作012---I was young and I just wanted a job, okay?
但最后一刻我无法做下去012---But at the last minute I couldn't go through with it.
他们后来让我演修影印机的人  但我没法修012---So they let me be the guy who comes in to fix the copier but can't...
因为有人在上面办那档事012---...because there's people having sex on it.
哇噢012---Wow.
好狂野012---That is wild.
那是什么形状  有长毛吗012---So, what's it shaped like? Is there a hair on it?
你弹它时有什么反应012---What happens if you flick it?
它有什么特殊之处012---So, uh, does it do anything, you know, special?
按下我的第三个奶头可以通往…012---Why, yes, Ross, pressing my third nipple opens the delivery entrance...
纳尼亚的神奇国度012---...to the magical land of Narnia.
有些文化认为 有三个奶头的人特别有男子气概012---You know, in some cultures, having a third nipple is actually a sign of virility.
你可以住最好的屋子  还有裸女围着你跳舞012---You get the best huts, and women dance naked around you.
那地方会不会恰巧  就在这附近的三州地带012---Huh. Are, uh, any of these cultures, per chance, in the Tri-State area?
你真厉害  你有什么不懂的事吗012---You know, you are so amazing. Is there anything you don't know?
茱莉好聪明   茱莉好特别喔012---Ooh, Julie's so smart. Julie's so special.
我跟你一样渴望你跟罗斯复合012---Look, honey, I wanted you to hook up with Ross as much as you did.
但他现在有新欢了  你得想办法克服这感觉012---But he's with her now. You're just gonna have to get over it.
喔  我得想办法克服012---Oh, I'm going to have to get over it.
我都不知道我就只能克服这感觉012---God, see, I didn't know that's what I had to do. I just have to get over it.
喔012---Whoa.
漂亮小姐  你要去哪012---Sassy lady. Where are you going?
我要去见邓肯  他今晚在花园广场溜冰012---Um, I'm gonna go meet Duncan. He's skating tonight at the Garden.
他是溜冰表演团的012---He's in the Capades.
冰上溜冰   难不成在石头上溜012---The Ice Capades? No, no, the Gravel Capades.
虽然溜不快  但史努比跌倒时  还是很好笑012---Yeah, the turns aren't as fast, but when Snoopy falls? Funny.
我不敢相信你为他盛装赴约  你这是在自讨苦吃012---I can't believe you're dressing up for him. You're setting yourself up all over again.
并不是012---Okay, no.
我告诉你  我见他是为了忘掉这段感情012---For your information, I'm going to see him so I can put all those feelings behind me.
我这样穿是因为我觉得…012---And the reason I'm dressed like this is because I think it's nice...
为同志老公打扮是很好的事012---...to look nice for your gay husband.
妈的  牛奶没了012---Darn it, we're all out of milk.
钱德  帮我加满好吗012---Hey, Chandler, will you fill me up here?
喔  我懂了  原来是因为我有第三个奶头012---Oh, I see, I see. Because of the third-nipple thing.
甜心  晚点再见了  再见012---Okay, sweetie, I'll see you later.  Bye.
瑞秋  待会儿见   拜拜 茱莉012---See you later, Rach. Bye-bye, Julie.
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
拜托  别闹了012---Hey, come on, cut it out.
嘿   什么事012---Hey. What?
我能问你一件事吗   当然可以012---Can I ask you something?  Sure.
什么啦012---Eh. What?
跟我说嘛   好吧012---Come on, talk to me. Okay.
你恋爱时  不上床最久是…012---What's the longest you've been in a relationship before...
维持多久的时间012---...having the sex?
你为何问这…  是谁… 你跟茱莉还没012---Why? Who's not...? Are you and Julie not...?
你跟茱莉还没上床吗012---Are you and Julie not having sex?
这个嘛012---Well...
技术上来说是没有012---Technically? No.
是因为她在床上很冷淡吗012---Is it because she's so cold in bed?
还是她有点颐指气使  让你觉得像小学生012---Or is it because she's kind of bossy, makes it feel like school?
不  她很好  我们不是完全没进展012---No. No. She's great. And it's not like we haven't done anything.
我们做了很多事  比如说…012---I mean, we do plenty of other stuff. Lots of other stuff like...
不  我不需要知道细节012---No, no, no. Don't need to know the details.
不  只是…012---No, it's just...
是我的问题012---It's me.
我这辈子就只跟过一个女人012---You know, I've only been with one woman my whole life...
结果她变成一个蕾丝边012---...and she turned out to be a lesbian. Uh-huh.
所以现在我很害怕012---So now I've got myself all psyched out.
这就像是…012---It's become, like, this...
一个障碍012---...this thing, and I...
你一定觉得我很怪012---You must just think I'm weird.
不  我一点都不这么觉得012---No. No, no, no. I don't think it's weird.
我认为  事实上…012---I think... I think, um, in fact...
你知道我怎么想吗  怎么想012---In fact, you know what I think? What?
我认为这很性感012---I think it's sexy.
性感012---Sexy?
我告诉你  身为女人  最性感的男人…012---Let me tell you something. As a woman... ...there is nothing sexier...
就是不想上床的男人012---...than a man who does not want to have sex.
真的  你知道我会怎么办吗012---No kidding.  Oh, yeah. In fact, you know what I'd do?
我会等待012---I'd wait.
你会等待  没错  我会等待…012---You'd wait? Yes, absolutely. I would wait...
等待…012---...and wait...
再等持012---Then I'd wait some more.
真的  没错012---Really? Oh, yeah.
不管她说她有多想要  她怎么乞求你…012---I don't care how much she tells you she wants it, I don't care if she begs... ...she pleads
甚至拿跟别的男人上床来威胁你012---She tells you she's gonna have sex with another man.
那就代表这招奏效了012---That just means it's working.
女人要的是这个012---Women really want this?
比珠宝还渴望012---More than jewelry.
嗨012---Hi.
菲比012---Phoebe.Ta-da.
嗨012---Hi.
看看你  你看起来好漂亮012---Ah, look at you. You look great.
是吗  谢谢012---Do I? Thank you.
你也是  闪闪发光   谢谢012---So do you. Sparkly. Thanks.
那么…012---So...
这真是太棒了 溜冰男主角012---Wow. This is pretty wonderful, huh, Mr. Major Capades Guy.
我还记得你以前只是个跑龙套的012---I remember when you were just like King Friday in Mr. Roger's Ice Is Nice.
你总是说我会成功的012---You always said I'd make it.
是啊  我的预感是蛮吓人的012---Yeah, well, you know, I'm kind of spooky that way. Woo.
天啊  我真想念你012---God, I missed you.
我得去换件衣服  好的012---I'm gonna get changed. Okay.
我是说现在012---Um, now.
什么   菲比012---What? Pheebs.
喔  好的012---Oh. Right. Okay.
什么012---What?
斗牛士…012---The Matador, so...
噢也  哈哈012---Olé. Ha, ha.
甜心  帮我拿着好吗  好啊012---Sweetie, can you hold this for a second? Sure.
谢了012---Thanks.
茱莉  是的012---Uh, Julie?  Yeah.
对不起  有个古生物学家在你脸上012---Sorry, you had a paleontologist on your face.
现在没了  你没事了012---But, uh, it's gone now. You're all right.
大家好   嗨012---Hi, everyone.Hi.
听着  听着  我要谢谢你之前跟我的聊天012---Oh, listen, listen... I wanted to thank you for, uh, our little talk before.
不客气  所以你会采取等待策略012---Oh, God, no problem. So you're gonna go with the waiting thing?
我本想这么做  但跟你谈过后  我跟乔伊谈过012---Well, I was going to, but after I talked to you, I talked to Joey.
很好  他怎么说012---Good. Ahem. What did he say?
基本上  他告诉我别想太多  尽管放手去做012---Basically, he told me to get over myself and just do it.
于是我想了想你说的和他说的012---So I thought about what you said and about what he said.
依他的说法  我今晚就可以跟她上床  所以…012---And, well, his way, I get to have sex tonight, so...
我口袋里的这个是什么012---What is this in my pocket?
天啊  是乔伊的色情月012---Why, it's Joey's porno movie.
放进去播吧012---Pop it in.
我无所谓  如果你看到里面的人只有两个奶头不会觉得奇怪的话012---I'm fine with it, I mean, if you're okay watching a video filled with two-nippled people.
性爱画面  那正是我需要的012---Great. People having sex. That's just what I need to see.
性爱有什么不对012---What's wrong with people having sex?
嗯…012---Well...
你知道  这种片子很恶心012---Well, um, you know, these movies are offensive...
并且丑化女人和女性012---...and, uh, degrading to women and females...
灯光也打得很差012---And, uh, the lighting's always unflattering.
还有…012---And...
摩妮卡  帮我一下   管他的  我想看乔伊012---Monica, help me out here. Hell, I wanna see Joey.
是有故事情节还是他们直接就…012---So is there, like, a story, or do they just start doing it right...
喔  当我没说012---Oh. Never mind.
等等  那是我见过  最疯狂的打字测试012---Okay, now, wait a minute. That is the craziest typing test I've ever seen.
我说她最好能得到这份工作012---All I say is, she better get the job.
依我看  他才是得到这份〝工作〞的人012---Looks to me like he's the one getting the job.
我来了…我来了012---Shh. Hey, here I come. Here I come.
我来修影印机了012---See, I'm coming to fix the copier.
我没办法走到影印机那  心里想我该怎么办012---I can't get to the copier. I'm thinking, "What do I do? What do I do?"
于是我就看他们亲热012---So I just watch them have sex.
等等  我的台词来了012---And then I say... Here's my line.
这样会弄坏送纸匣的012---You know, that's bad for the paper tray.
干得好  朋友   谢谢012---Nice work, my friend. Thank you.
等等  我又出现了 等等  那男的屁股挡着我012---Wait, you see me again. Hang on, the guy's butt's blocking me.
我出现了…出现了…012---There I am. There I am. There I am.
有什么事吗  你昨天去找我012---So, um... So, what's up? You came to see me yesterday.
喔  对012---Oh, yeah, um...
好吧012---All right.
我需要离婚012---I kind of need a divorce.
好…的012---Okay.
为什么012---How come?
事实上  我要再婚了012---Um, actually, I'm getting married again.
什么  天啊  我真不知道该怎么告诉你012---What? Oh, God, I don't know how to tell you this.
我是异性恋012---I'm straight.
我知道012---Yeah, I know.
我不懂 我不懂 你怎么会是异性恋012---I don't understand. I don't understand. How can you be straight?
你是如此聪明和风趣 又那么会办奥斯卡金奖派对012---I mean, you're so smart and funny... ...and you throw such great Academy Award parties.
我知道  我也是那样告诉自己012---I know. That's what I kept telling myself.
但有一天  你会发现再也无法活在谎言里012---But you just reach a point where you can't live a lie anymore.
你知道有多久了012---So how long have you known?
我想在某个程度上  我一直知道自己是异性恋012---I guess on some level I always knew I was straight.
我不应该是这样的012---I thought I was supposed to be something else.
我是冰上舞者  我朋友都是同志  我只是想融入他们012---You know, I'm an ice dancer, all my friends are gay. I was just trying to fit in.
那么…012---And, um...
所以你真的爱上一个女人012---And there's actually a woman?
她的名字是黛柏拉012---Her name's Debra.Oh.
她是你第一个在一起的女人012---Well, is she the first that you've been with?
我从没告诉过你…012---Well, I've never told you this...
但我大学时曾经有一  两次012---...but there were one or two times back in college...
喝得醉醺醺的跑去酒吧012---...when I'd get really drunk and go to a straight bar...
醒来发现身旁躺着女人012---...and wake up with a woman next to me.
我告诉自己那是酒精的缘故  大学还是摸索的年纪012---But I told myself it was the liquor, and everyone experiments in college.
当然012---Sure.
现在我知道自己没选择了  我生来就是如此012---But now I know I don't have a choice about this. I was born this way.
我不知道要说什么012---I don't know what to say.
你跟一个人结婚六年  以为自己很了解他012---You know, you're married to someone for six years... and you think you know him.
但有一天他突然说 〝我不是同志！〞012---And then one day he says, "Oh, I'm not gay."
我还是我啊012---I'm... I'm still me.
为何你在六年前没想清楚呢012---Why couldn't you just have figured this out six years ago?
你知道  里面闻起来还是有猴子的味道喔012---You know, it still smells like monkey in there.
那我们就不用多说了012---Well, that saves us the conversation.
今晚很棒  但我好累012---Well, this has been great, but I'm officially wiped.
我也是  我们该走了  不012---Me too. We should get going.No.
不  拜托你们012---No. I mean... No. Come on, you guys.
别这样  现在才十一点半012---Come on, look, it's only 11:30.
我们来聊天  我们好久没一起聊天了012---Let's just talk. We never just hang out and talk anymore.
瑞秋  我们总是在聊天012---Rachel, that's all we do.
我们或许经常那样  但菜莉呢012---Maybe that's all we do. What about Julie?
茱莉怎样012---What about Julie?
你出现在我们生活圈将近两个月012---Well, you have been in our lives for nearly two months now...
但我们并不真的了解你012---...and we don't really know you.
我是说  茱莉是谁  你喜欢什么  讨厌什么012---I mean, who is Julie? I mean, what do you like? What don't you like?
我们想知道一切012---We want to know everything.
那要花点时间012---Well, heh, that could take a while.
所以呢012---So?
这里有谁没时间了解茱莉012---I mean, who here does not have the time to get to know Julie?
我有时间  我有012---I got the time to get to know Julie. I got time, yeah.
瑞秋  我很了解她  我可以走吗012---Uh, Rach, ahem, I know her pretty well. Can I go?
好吧012---That's fine.
我们从你的童年谈起吧  你的童年如何012---Okay, Julie, so let's start with your childhood. What was that like?
简而言之…012---Well, in a nutshell... Ah-ah-ah.
那… 你告诉你父母了吗012---So, um, have you told your parents?
还没  但那没问题  他们不会有意见的012---No, but it'll be okay. They're pretty cool.
我哥也是异性恋  所以…012---My brother's straight, so...
好了012---Here you go.
对了  我还有个问题012---You know what? I just have one more question. Um...
如果你早点发现  而我又在你身边012---If you had figured this out sooner, and, um, I had been around...
你觉得我能不能成为…012---...do you think I would have been the one who?
不  别告诉我012---No, no. That's all right. Don't tell me.
不管是哪个答案我都不会宽慰些  拿去吧012---I don't think either answer would make me feel better. Here.
我爱你  菲比012---I love you, Phoebe.
所以你老哥是异性恋  是吗012---So your brother's straight, huh?
我是认真的012---Seriously.
我二年级的老师是汤姆斯小姐012---And my second-grade teacher was Miss Thomas...
一年级老师是柯比太太012---...and my first-grade teacher was Mrs. Cobb.
葛比太太012---Ahem. Mrs. Gobb?
不  柯比  柯比沙拉的柯比012---No, Cobb. Like cobb salad.
好012---Hmm, okay.
那… 柯比沙拉里面到底有什么012---Now, what exactly is in a cobb salad?
我要回家了012---I'm going home.
天啊  茱莉还真能讲012---Boy, that Julie's a talker, huh?
晚安012---Good night.
呼嘘012---Whew.
那么…  晚安012---So...  Good night.
时候不早了  你或许不再打算要…012---It's pretty late. You're probably, uh, not still planning on...
不  我还是想012---Oh. No, no, I am. Oh.
你会紧张吗012---Well, hey, are you nervous?
不会… 我…012---No, no. I, uh...
我有过经验的012---I have done it before.
我是说  你打算怎么做012---Well, okay, I mean, how are you gonna handle it?
你会先跟她谈一谈  或者就直接扑上去012---Are you gonna talk about it beforehand? Are you just gonna pounce?
我不知道  我想我就…012---I, uh... I don't know. I guess I'm just gonna...
看着办吧012---...see what happens.
好吧  祝你好运012---Okay. Good luck.

日后要表现好就很难了012---...well then, that's pretty darn hard to recover from.
你这么说我倒紧张了012---Okay, now I'm nervous.
或许你应该缓一缓012---Maybe you should put it off.
不  我不想再延后了012---No, I don't want to put it off.
去年我悲惨到不行012---God, I'm just... I spent last year being so unbelievably miserable.
