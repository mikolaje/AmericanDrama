大家动作快点  4小时后的航班012---You guys, hurry up. The flight leaves in four hours.
打的还要时间  路上可能会堵车  飞机还可能提前起飞012---It could take time to get a taxi! There could be traffic! The plane could leave early.
到了伦敦  入境通关还要排队   快点012---When we get to London, there could be a line at customs. Come on.
6小时的飞机  够她念了012---Six-hour trip to London. That's a lot of Monica.
护照  打勾  相机  打勾  旅行支票  打勾012---Passport, check. Camera, check. Traveler's checks, check.
你在叫谁 "打勾"   我自己012---Who are you saying "check" to? Myself.
记起一样就打一个勾012---For remembering to pack the thing.
做好一件事  就打个勾勾012---You know, you do a good thing, you get a check.
这是我妈的习惯   我从不觉得很怪啊012---My mom does it. I never realized it was weird.
我妈都把头塞进烤箱里012---Hey, my mom used to put her head in the oven, so...
其实只有一次  但觉得蛮怪异的012---Actually, she only did it the one time. But it was pretty weird.
嘿   嘿012---Hey. Hey.
嘿  准备好了吗012---Hey. Are you ready yet?
好了  机票带了吗  在这里  打勾012---Yep. You got the tickets? Oh, got them right here. Check.
去伦敦喽   宝贝  走吧012---It's all London, baby. Here we go.
护照呢012---You got your passport?
衣橱第三个抽屉里   弄丢就糟了012---Yeah, in my third drawer of my dresser. You don't wanna lose that.
快去012---Oh. There it is.
老友记  第四季  第23集  罗斯的婚礼（上）012---Friends  S04E23  The One With Ross's Wedding Parts I
如果要用吸尘器  就在我柜子里的左手边012---Okay, if you need the vacuum, it's in my closet on the left side.
垃圾袋在冰箱旁边012---The garbage bags are next to the refrigerator.
瑞秋会在  我不能问她吗012---But Rachel's gonna be here too. Can't I just ask her?
哦  行啊  回头你试试012---Heh. Yeah, okay. Give that a try.
好啦好啦  快走吧012---All right, let's do it. Woohoo.
伦敦  宝贝012---Yeah. Cheerio. London, baby.
我绝对不会烦  伦敦  宝贝012---Because that's not gonna get annoying. London, baby!
你知道吗  我错了012---Oh, you know what? I was wrong. Ha, ha.
行  人都到了  我们该走了012---Well, we're all here. I guess we should get going.
我真想过去拥抱你一下012---Oh, I wanna come over there and give you a hug...
祝你婚礼一切顺利  但是我起不来012---...and wish you luck on your wedding, but I can't get up.
我过来拥抱你好了  太好了  能不能帮我把报纸带过来012---Oh, I'll come hug you. Great, can you bring me the newspaper?
好啊012---Yeah.
快快乐乐的结婚吧   谢谢012---Have a great wedding. Oh. Thanks.
钱德  我也想抱你  嘿012---Hey, Chandler, I wanna hug you too. Hey.
顺便去你家餐台  把我的书拿来012---And you might as well bring me my book. It's on the counter in your apartment.
我们要走了  玩得开心点012---So we're off. Have fun.
谢谢012---Thanks. Oh.
你居然不能去012---Oh. I can't believe you're not gonna be there.
是啊012---Oh, I know.
去嘛  你为什么不能去  什么012---So come. Why don't you come? What?
去伦敦  一起去  拜托  我会很高兴012---To London. Come to London. Please? It would mean so much to me.
我要忙  对不起012---Yeah, well, I gotta work. I'm sorry.
为什么不能请两天假  我不行  我说过了012---Why can't you take a couple of days off? Because I can't. I told you. No, I can't.
这是我的婚礼012---This is my wedding.
真的来不及了  走走走012---All right, you know what? Now we are late. Let's go, let's go, let's go!
好吧  回来再让你看录影带012---Fine, you'll watch it on video when we get back.
菲比  你的书书  苏苏012---Here you go, Phoebe. Here you go, Phoebo, Phoobala, Phobayboo.
你啊012---You. Ha, ha.
走吧   菲比再见012---All right, let's go. Bye, Pheebs.
再见  菲比  再见012---Bye. Bye, Pheebs.
再见012---Mwah. Goodbye. Mwah.
再见  旅途愉快012---Bye. Safe flight.
伦敦  宝贝012---London, baby.
天哪  你要抱抱吗012---Oh, God. Oh. Do you need a hug?
你不必拿东西给我012---You don't have to bring me anything.
钱德   做点动作012---All right, Chandler, do something.
来啊  做动作啊  我在做啊  我正在当你不存在012---Come on, do something. I am. I'm ignoring you.
好吧  你来拍我吧  好012---Okay, I'm gonna be the on-camera guy. All right.
第一站   西敏寺012---First stop, Westminster Abbey.
那是什么  伦敦啊  宝贝012---Oh, what the hell is that? That's London, baby.
好  饭店在这里012---All right, the hotel's here.
等一下  不对  我们要去…012---Wait. No, we wanna go...
不对012---No.
我知道了012---I know.
我得站到地图上去012---I'm gonna have to go into the map.
要是里面有个小钱德  踩死他012---Okay, if you see a little version of me in there, kill it.
我知道了012---I got it.
走吧012---Here we go.
听着  我们不是要这样逛大街吧012---Okay, listen, listen, we're not gonna have to walk this way the entire time, are we?
你害的我又乱了012---Oh, man, you made me lose it.
那时候还不到10点012---…and that was all before 10 o'clock.
厨师告诉我说用基辅鸡肉代替龙嵩叶鸡肉012---The caterer rang and said it was going to be Chicken Kiev instead of Chicken Tarragon.
然后花店又说没有郁金香了012---The florist phoned to say there aren't any tulips.
然后大提琴手得了  腕关节综合症012---Oh, and then the cellist has carpal tunnel syndrome...
喔 喔 喔   艾蜜莉  亲爱的  好吗012---Whoa, whoa, whoa. Emily, honey. Okay?
好吧  我也去你妈的  什么012---Well, up yours too. What?
不  这是暂停的意思  对不起012---No, no. That's "time-out." Sorry.
放轻松   一切都会很美好012---Sweetie, you gotta relax. Everything's gonna be great, okay?
走吧  走吧012---Come on, come on.
基辅鸡012---Chicken kiev? Mm-hm.
听起来最后这道菜很美味吧012---Doesn't that sound delicious at the last minute?
是啊  但鲑鱼一类的东西012---I know, but something like salmon would just...
比鸡肉看起来档次更高一点012---It would be so much more elegant than chicken.
而且你还不用担心会感染沙门氏菌012---And you wouldn't have to worry about the salmonella.
真想赶快看到婚礼场地012---So, I can't wait to see where you're getting married.
是啊  没错  那里很美  她父母就在那里结婚012---Yeah. Yeah. Yes, This place is beautiful. Emily's parents got married here.
还是不敢相信  它居然要被拆了012---So, can't believe they're tearing it down.
你绝对没看过那么美的房子012---It really is the most lovely building you'll ever see.
就在…012---I mean, it's over...
天哪012---Oh, my God.
还不错012---It's nice.
我的天哪012---Oh. Oh, my God.
怎么会这样  我们怎么办012---How can this be happening? What are we gonna do?
放心  不会有问题的012---It's all right! Everything's gonna be all right.
怎么会没问题  说得也是012---How is it gonna be all right? Uh-huh, I see that.
我跟拿铲子的那个人聊过了  知道怎么回事了012---Okay, I talked to the guy with the shovel and I found out what happened.
怎么回事  提前了几天拆除012---What? What? They tore it down a few days early.
漂亮012---All right.
西敏寺012---Westminster Abbey.
绝对是我见过最美的寺012---Hands down, best abbey I ever seen.
嘿012---Hey.
好012---Okay.
钱德   你觉得西敏寺如何012---What do you think of the abbey, Chandler?
很宏伟   他们正打算改名012---Oh, I think it's great. It's great. Y'know, They're thinking of changing the name of this place.
真的  改成什么  改成 "摄像机收起来"012---Really? To what? To "Put the Camera Away."
老兄  你可以改叫 "西敏寺神经病"了012---Man, you are Westminster Crabby.
别起来  你需要什么  没什么012---Honey, don't get up. What do you need? Oh, no. Oh, nothing.
没关系  我就是留下来照顾你的  需要什么  什么都行012---Come on. I'm here to take care of you. What do you need? Anything.
好吧  屁股夹到内裤了012---Okay, I have a wedgie.
那你还是自己解决012---Okay, that is all you.
中午想吃什么012---So, what do you want for lunch?
我不知道012---Oh, I don't know.
我们是得吃饭  是啊  我得吃啊012---I guess we have to eat. Yeah, I do.
怎么了012---What's the matter?
我应付罗斯的方式真差劲啊012---I'm just bummed the way I left things with Ross.
真后悔骗他说我要上班的012---I wish I didn't lie to him about having to work.
他好像很气我012---He seemed so mad at me.
别太责备自己  要是我还爱的人要结婚012---Ah, don't be so hard on yourself. If someone I was still in love with was...
还爱的人  是啊012---Still in love with? Yeah.
我才没有爱着罗斯呢012---I'm not in love with Ross.
是没有  那很好012---No, no. Good.
我也没有012---Yeah, me neither.
菲比  我不去是因为他是我的旧情人012---Phoebe, I'm not going to Ross' wedding, because he's my ex-boyfriend...
去了会很不自在012---...and that would be really uncomfortable.
不是因为我还爱着他  我跟大家一样喜欢罗斯012---Not because I'm still in love with him. Hey, I like Ross as much as the next guy.
我对他的确有感情  但那不是爱012---You know, clearly I have feelings for him, but feelings don't mean love.
我对罗斯还有爱的感觉吗012---You know, I mean, do I still have loving feelings for Ross?
有012---Yeah.
我一直都有012---I have continuing feelings of love.
但那并不表示我还爱着他012---But that doesn't mean that I'm still in love with him.
我对他还有性趣  但我当然爱他012---You know, I mean, I have sexual feelings for him, but I do love him.
天哪012---Oh, my God. Oh, my...
你为什么不告诉我012---Why didn't you tell me?
我们以为你知道  我们012---We thought you knew. We?
对  我们都知道  还经常在聊012---Yeah, we all know. We talk about it all the time.
你们都知道  罗斯知道吗012---You all know? Does Ross know?
不  罗斯什么都不知道012---Oh, no. Ross doesn't know anything.
你们居然没告诉我012---Oh. I cannot believe you didn't tell me.
我们以为你知道  那么明显012---Because we thought you knew. It's so obvious.
告诉你等于告诉摩妮卡012---God, it would be like, you know, telling Monica:
"喂  你很爱干净喔"012---"Hey," you know, "you like things clean."
你好012---Hi.
先生想买什么012---So, what are you fine gentlemen in the market for?
有围巾  明信片  你看012---We've got scarves, souvenir postcards. Check this out, huh?
棒及了012---Oh, yeah.
这个就对了  你觉得呢012---That's the stuff. What do you think?
我不必买印着  "与笨蛋同行" 的T恤了012---Well, I'm not gonna have to buy that "I'm with stupid" T-shirt anymore.
我喜欢  钱给你012---Well, I like it. Here you go.
你不是来真的吧  你丢我的脸丢得还不够吗012---All right, look, you're not really gonna buy that are you? Don't you think you've embarrassed me enough for one day?
我丢你的脸012---Oh, I embarrass you?
我假装不认识你  无法回答012---How can I answer that when I'm pretending I don't know you?
他是在嫉妒  伦敦人都在戴012---He's just jealous. You'll fit right in. All Londoners wear them.
是吗  那这里怎么没人戴012---Oh, really? Then how come no one here anywhere is wearing one?
他们都是观光客012---They're all tourists.
那好吧  如果你要当街戴着那顶帽子012---All right, look, if you insist on wearing that in public, you know...
下午你就自己去逛着玩吧012---...you're gonna spend the rest of the afternoon all by yourself.
是吗012---Oh, yeah?
如果要在你和帽子之间做选择  我选择帽子012---If you're gonna make me choose between you and the hat, I choose the hat.
够英明  谢了012---Good choice. Thanks.
好吧  够了  就这样012---Okay, look. All right, that's it, okay?
我要走了  我不想再丢脸了012---I'm out of here. I'm not gonna be embarrassed anymore.
哈罗  嘿012---Hello? Hey.
我跟你爸谈过  你猜怎么012---I just spoke to your dad, and you know what?
他觉得可以另外找到场地012---He seems to think we'll be able to find a new place for the wedding
不必了  难道  你找到地方了012---We don't have to. What, you found a place?
没有  但摩妮卡和我讨论过012---No, but Monica and I were talking...
礼堂被拆  我的确很烦012---...and I was so upset about the hall being knocked down...
结果她建议  把婚期延后012---...and she suggested that we just put the wedding off for a bit.
她说什么  她说如果我不喜欢012---She said what? She said if I'm not happy...
临时找个地方  我们就应该延期012---...getting married somewhere we can find in a day, well, we should just postpone it.
延期012---Postpone it? Heh.
艾蜜莉  你觉得摩妮卡知道  我们爸妈花了多少钱吗012---Emily, do you think Monica realizes how much our parents spent on this wedding?
你觉得我妹的那个小脑袋能够理解012---Huh? Do you think my sister's teeny, tiny little brain comprehends...
大家特地腾出时间012---...that people took time out of their lives...
大老远飞来这里吗012---...to fly thousands of miles to be here? Huh?
这么做不对的012---This isn't right.
我知道  大家会失望012---I realize that people are going to be disappointed.
我相信等我们一切就绪了  他们还是会回来的012---I'm sure they'll come back when we can do it right.
我不能叫人家这么做  你会吗012---Well, I can't ask people to do that. Would you ask people to do that?
别拿你的裤子指着我012---Don't you point your pants at me.
我们别无选择012---We have no choice.
像样一点的场地一定没空档012---Anywhere that's half-decent will have been booked months ago.
你不懂吗  罗斯  这是我们的婚礼012---Ross, don't you understand? This is our wedding I'm talking about.
我只知道延期是不可能的012---The only thing I understand is postponing it is not an option.
要结就现在结012---This is when we're getting married.
你的意思是  要么就不结了  不  我是说现在就结012---What are you saying, it's now or never? No, I'm saying it's now.
否则呢   我没说 "否则"012---Or? There's no "or" in mine.
这条裤子是怎么搞的012---What is wrong with these pants?
不是裤子的问题  是你自己穿反了012---It's not the pants. It's you who's backwards.
要是你不懂这件事对我有多重要012---And if, and if you don't understand how important this is to me...
或许  我们就根本不该结婚012---well then, perhaps we shouldn't be getting married at all.
艾蜜莉  等一下  别走012---Emily, no. Wait, stop. Emily, please...
嘿  嗨012---Hey. Hi.
血拼完有没有舒服一点嘛012---So did shopping help you feel any better about Ross?
舒服的话曼哈顿的店都不够012---Manhattan does not have enough stores.
我能帮你忘了他012---Well, I think I can help you get over him.
真的  对012---You can? Yeah.
拿几张罗斯的照片012---I just need you to bring me some photos of Ross...
一小片巧克力012---...and, um, a small piece of chocolate...
和一杯温水来012---...and a glass of tepid water.
是不是要跟墓地的土装在一起012---Ooh. Is this one of those things where you throw stuff in a bag with graveyard dirt...
挂在面北的树上012---...and hang it from a north-facing tree?
要是你也在打嗝的话012---Uh, only if you have the hiccups too.
照片是给你的  其它的是我要的012---The pictures are for you. The chocolate and water's for me.
我只是不想起来012---I just didn't feel like getting up.
我给你看一张罗斯的照片  好012---Okay. I'm gonna show you a picture of Ross, okay...
你要去想他不好的地方012---...and you're going to remember all the bad things about him, all right?
专心想他的缺点  没问题012---Really focus on his flaws. I can do that.
原来交往的时候我就这样012---Certainly did that while we were going out. Heh.
好012---Okay. Mm.
首先我想先声明  我爱罗斯012---Before we get started, I just wanna say, for the record, I love Ross.
他真的好棒012---I think he's such a great guy.
好  闭上眼睛012---Okay. Now close your eyes.
想像你跟罗斯在一起012---And imagine that you're with Ross. Mm-hm.
想像你在亲他012---Okay, and imagine that you're kissing him. Mm-hm.
你的手在他的身上游移012---You're running your hands all over his body.
你的手抚弄他的头发012---And then you run your hands through his hair...
但是好恶心  是某种油012---...but, oh, ew, gross, it's some kind of grease, it's... Ugh.
我不知道012---I don't know.
他的头发没那么困扰我012---I don't know, his hair never bothered me that much.
那应该算是硬而不是油012---And you know, it was always more crunchy than it was greasy.
好吧  难度比我想的还高012---Okay. This is gonna be harder than I thought.
试试厌恶疗法好了012---Um, ahem. Let's try some aversion therapy.
好  好吧  怎么样  好012---Okay. All right. Okay? All right.
看着照片  好012---Look at the picture. Okay.
好  然后012---All right, and, um...
现在觉得怎样  我开始不喜欢你了012---Okay. How do you feel now? Well, I like you less.
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
抱歉  我才该抱歉012---Oh. Sorry. No, no, you know what? I'm sorry.
我不该说你丢我的脸012---I really shouldn't have said you that were embarrassing me.
那样很过份012---That really wasn't cool.
如果能让你高兴一点   不过我今天过得可没意思了012---And if it makes you feel any better, I've had a really lousy day.
我也是012---Me too.
真的  当然不是012---Yeah? No!
这是我最兴奋的一天012---I had the best day ever.
伙计  看看这个012---Dude, check this out.
告诉我朋友  你喜欢我的帽子012---Say hi to my friend and tell him you like my hat.
好  你朋友叫什么  钱德012---Okay, so, what's your friend's name? Oh. Chandler.
钱德  你好012---Hi, Chandler.
那不是…012---That's... That's...
天啊  那是佛姬  宝贝012---Oh, my God. That's Fergie, baby!
乔伊说你不喜欢他的帽子  但我觉得挺时髦的012---Joey says you don't really like his hat, but I think it's kind of dashing.
你怎么会  什么时候012---When did you...? How...?
我那时正在想办法去白金汉宫012---I was trying to figure out how to get to Buckingham Palace, right?
我站到了地图上   然后012---So I'm in my map and...
嘿012---Hey.
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
听说你和艾蜜莉谈过012---I understand you had a little talk with Emily.
没错  谈过012---Ha, ha. Yes, I did.
不客气012---And you are welcome.
是吗012---Am I?
是你提议把婚期延后的012---And was it your idea to postpone the wedding?
我要上厕所  等我012---I'm gonna go to the bathroom. Wait up.
既然你这么会解决问题  问题来了012---Hey, hey, since you're the fix-it lady, here's a pickle:
当新娘说她不想结婚时  你怎么办012---What do you do when the bride says she doesn't wanna have the wedding at all?
她这么说  对012---She said that? Yeah.
为什么  我不知道012---Why? I don't know.
我说为了礼堂被拆就延期  实在太蠢了012---I told her it was stupid to put off the wedding just because the hall was gone...
然后  她就发火了012---...and she, like, flipped out.
天哪   你比我还笨012---Oh, my God. You're even dumber than I am.
什么012---Excuse me?
你筹备这次婚礼多久了012---Ross, how long have you been planning this wedding?
记不清了  1个月吧012---I don't know. A month?
艾蜜莉可能从5岁就在计划了012---Emily has probably been planning it since she was 5.
从她第一次把枕头套  戴在头上开始012---Ever since the first time she took a pillowcase and hung it off her head.
女生都这样012---That's what we did.
我们梦想在一个完美的场地012---We dreamed about the perfect wedding.
办一场完美的婚礼012---In the perfect place.
有一个完美的四层结婚蛋糕012---With the perfect four-tiered wedding cake.
上面有木偶小人012---With the little people on top.
但最重要的是…012---But the most important part...
有个完美的男人012---...is that we had the perfect guy...
能理解这一切  对我们有多重要012---...who understood just how important all that other stuff was.
这我都不知道012---I had no idea.
我以为你披枕头套  是在学 "飞天修女"012---That pillowcase thing, I thought you guys were just doing The Flying Nun.
有时候是这样的啦012---Sometimes we were.
别哭了012---Come on.
帮我想想办法012---You gotta help me figure out what to do.
好吗   好012---Okay? All right.
走吧012---Come on.
刚才的气氛可真紧张  是啊012---Whoa. Pretty intense, huh? Yeah.
希望罗斯不会以为  我们是怕尴尬才进厕所012---Hey, I hope Ross didn't think that we just went in there because we were uncomfortable being out here!
希望他就是这么想的012---I hope he did.
喂   菲比  我是乔伊012---Hello? Hey, Pheebs, it's Joey.
乔伊   嘿012---Hey, Joey. Hey. Ooh, ooh.
我在地铁看到一个很像你的人012---I just saw someone that looks just like you on the subway.
我正想打招呼  又想到他不会在乎他长得像你012---I was gonna go over and say hi, but then I figured he doesn't care he looks like you.
你说这些花了我4块钱了012---That just cost me 4 bucks.
