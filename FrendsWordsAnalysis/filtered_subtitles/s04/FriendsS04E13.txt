她是女主角  又是我的女朋友012---Okay, she is the star of the play, and she is my girlfriend.
我在跟这部戏里的女主角上床012---I get to have sex with the star of the play.
别人都听见了  我知道012---People can hear you. I know.
她很漂亮吧  对吧012---Wow, she looks great, doesn't she? Mm.
嗨   嗨012---Hi. Hi.
那个男的可真帅012---That is one good-looking man.
是我眼花  还是他的腹肌真的露出来了012---Is it just me, or can you actually see his abs through his overcoat?
那  你做这行很久了吗012---So, you been doing this long?
没有  你是我的第一个  把钱放在桌上012---No. You're my first. Put the money on the table.
很好啊012---Oh, yeah.
啊哦  好舒服012---Ooh, that's nice.
不会吧012---Dude.
这上衣很贵吗  你说贵就贵012---Is that an expensive blouse? If you want it to be.
你女朋友的钮扣012---Here's your girlfriend's button.
老友记  第四季  第13集  瑞秋坠入情网012---Friends S04E13  The One With Rachel's Crush
你还留着中学时的旧衣服嘛012---Oh, hey, Mon, do you still have, like, your old blouses and dresses from high school?
我想应该还有几件  怎么了012---Yeah, I think I have some around here somewhere. Why?
孕妇装都卖的好贵012---Well, it's just maternity clothes are so expensive.
瑞秋  你卧室那边  我收拾了一堆你的东西012---Hey, Rach, I made a pile of your stuff on this side of your room.
看你要不要012---If you could just... Ugh!
拿皮包扔它012---Throw your purses at it.
布鲁明戴尔裁减了我的部门012---Bloomingdale's eliminated my department.
天哪  你失业了吗  没有  但我被塞到专人采购部012---Oh, my God. Are you out of a job? No, they stuck me in Personal Shopping...
比原来矮了一大截012---...which is just a huge step down.
专人采购部  是做什么012---Personal Shopping, what is that?
陪有钱人逛街012---Like where you walk around with snooty rich people...
帮他们挑衣服012---...and tell them what to buy?
听起来好棒012---Uh-huh. That sounds great.
嘿012---Hey.
对不起  我们好像换过公寓了吧012---Um, excuse me, we switched apartments.
你再也不能吃我们的东西了  吃白食的好日子结束了012---You can't eat our food anymore. That gravy train has ended.
吃白食012---There's gravy?
你们房子大  就得随时准备应付人来人往012---If you have the big apartment, then deal with people coming over all the time.
所以冰箱要塞满东西  对面那个才是你们的房子012---That fridge has got to be stocked, okay? That's your apartment now.
你在干什么  我留了个甜甜圈在这里012---What are you doing? I think I left a doughnut up here.
嘿   嘿012---Hey. Hey.
凯西的戏怎样012---Oh, how was Kathy's play?
凯西半裸演床戏012---Well, Kathy gets half-naked and simulates sex...
跟一个大帅哥012---...with a real good-looking guy.
这就像有人把我的恶梦写成戏012---Yeah, it was like somebody wrote down my worst nightmare...
还要我花上32块钱去看012---...and then charged me $32 to see it.
这个点子有赚头012---That's a good idea for a business.
我受不了了  他们会在台上夜夜打得火热012---I'm totally screwed, okay? They're gonna be hot and heavy on-stage every night...
然后去参加剧组派对  会设法中伤我012---...and then they're gonna go to their cast parties, and he's gonna undermine me.
像是 "你男朋友呢  他叫什么钱斯特吗"012---You know, he'll be like, "So where's your boyfriend? What's his name, Chester?"
她会说 "不  不  不  是钱德"  他就说“随便啦”012---And she'll go, "No, no, no. It's Chandler." He'll go, "Whatever. Ha-ha-ha."
这招不错012---That is a good trick.
看么  我该怎么办012---All right, look, look. What am I gonna do?
钱德  他们是演员  他们只是在工作012---Chandler, look, they're actors. They're there to do a job.
工作总要逢场作戏  但不是都会弄假成真的012---Just because they work together doesn't mean they'll get together.
就像苏珊莎兰登和提姆罗宾斯也会那样做012---Just because it happened with Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins...
并不代表你的女友也会和别人做012---...doesn't mean it's gonna happen with them.
还有  亚历鲍德温和金贝辛格012---Oh, oh. Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger.
汤姆克鲁斯和妮可基德曼012---Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman. Yeah.
梅尔杰布森和克林伊斯威特012---Okay, Mel Gibson and Clint Eastwood.
他们不是一对012---They're not a couple.
喔  我听懂了012---Oh, okay, I get the game now.
好  我问你个问题012---Okay, look, look. Let me ask you a question.
他们在台上演床戏时  真的很火热吗012---When they were doing it on-stage, was it like really hot?
对啊012---Huh. Oh, yeah.
那就没问题了012---Well, okay, so then you're fine.
如果两个演员私底下在一起012---Look, the rule is when two actors are actually doing it off-stage...
他们之间的火花就会消失012---...then all the sexual tension between them is gone.
只要台上很火热  你就不用担心012---Okay? So as long as it's hot on-stage, you got nothing to worry about.
台上没有了火热度  你就有麻烦了012---It's when the heat goes away, that's when you're in trouble.
真的吗012---Really?
你们看过我演的每出戏012---You guys have been to every play I've been in.
我有在台上擦出过火花吗012---Have I ever had chemistry on-stage?
没有  对吧012---No. No.
你晚上要陪我去看戏吗012---So, uh, man, are you gonna go see the play with me tonight?
我不知道  看你女朋友012---You know what? I don't know how comfortable I am...
跟别人亲热  我觉得很尴尬012---...going to see how hot the sex is between some guy and your girlfriend.
我知道  但是  不  我人在现场012---Yeah, I know... No, no, no, oh, I'm there.
嘿  嘿  摩妮卡012---Hey. Hey, Mon.
要煎饼吗   你做煎饼了012---Want some pancakes? You made pancakes?
对  拿个盘子012---Yep. Grab a plate.
不  不  别过来012---No, no. Stay right there.
越来越近了012---Getting closer.
放心012---Don't worry...
也有谷月  松糕  松饼012---...we also have cereals, muffins, waffles...
果酱  果肉酱和果皮酱  其实是同一种东西012---...and jams, jellies and marmalades, which I'm fairly certain are the same thing.
星期六要看球赛   欢迎加入012---Also we're watching the game here Saturday, if people want to come over.
好啊012---Oh, yeah.Oh.
我正想找你们到对面看球012---I was having people over for the game.
是吗  谁跟谁比012---Oh, yeah? Who's playing?
球员跟球员012---The players.
有人在怀念当女主人喔012---Somebody seems to be missing being the hostess.
拜托   我不知道有多轻松012---Ha, ha. Please, it's a relief, is what it is, is what it is.
好  菲比  盘子准备好012---All right. Pheebs, stick out your plate.
哦012---Oh.
摩妮卡  我要辞职012---Monica, I'm quitting.
我帮一个老女人塞上丁字裤  结果她也没买012---I just helped an 81-year-old woman put on a thong, and she didn't even buy it.
我告诉你  我要辞职  现在就要跟老板说012---I'm telling you, I'm quitting, that's it. I'm talking to my boss right now.
我要  我要  我要012---Yes, I am. Yes, I am. Yes, I am.
好  拜拜  听到留言请回电012---Okay, bye. Call me when you get this message.
华森先生  我有事找你012---Oh! Mr. Waltham? I, uh, really need to talk to you.
等一下  我忙得不可开交012---In a moment, please. I'm in the middle of a task.
你有顾客上门012---And you have a customer.
你好  你好  我是约书亚012---Hi. Hi. I'm Joshua.
我是瑞秋葛林  有什么需要   约书亚012---Hi, I'm Rachel Green. What can I do for you, Joshua?
我的衣服都要重买  我老婆  我的前妻012---Well, I need a new wardrobe. My wife... Well, my ex-wife...
噢  我真遗憾012---Oh, I'm so sorry.
她把我的衣服都烧了012---Anyway, she burned all of my clothes.
我救回两件  这套西装和一条裙子012---So I got away with two things: This suit and what turned out to be a, uh, skirt. Heh.
起码这套西装还好看012---Well, at least that's a great suit.
但是穿着裙子 拿这套去干洗店一点也不好玩012---Yeah, it wasn't much fun dropping it off at the dry cleaners in the skirt.
所以  我需要包括内衣裤全套012---So I need everything down to underwear.
如果你愿意  我整个人就交给你了012---So if you're willing, I'm, uh... I'm all yours.
好的012---Okay.
瑞秋  你有事找我012---Rachel, you needed to speak to me?
没有了  不是我012---No, no, that wasn't me.
那我们走吧  带你去看我的内衣012---Well, we should get started. Let me show you my underwear.
我们的内衣专柜012---The selection of underwear that we carry.
对不起  是这边  这边  抱歉012---Oh, I'm sorry. It's this way.It's this way? Sorry.
对吧  现在他们之间一点感觉也没有012---I'm right, right? There was, like, no chemistry between them.
之前他们有热度  而现在却不见了012---Before, they had heat. And now there's no heat.
你知道其中含意  乔伊说过012---Now, you know what this means. Joey told us what this means.
先别急着下定论  行吗012---Let's not jump to any conclusions, all right?
他们之间还是有一点点火花的012---There was some sexual chemistry between them.
拜托  根本就像表兄妹在做爱012---Oh, come on. It was like cousins having sex up there.
她来了  什么都别说  冷静  跟平常一样012---Here she comes. Don't say a word, okay? Just be cool. Don't be, you know, you.
你们好   嘿012---Hey, you guys. Hey.
谢谢你们又来了012---Oh, thank you so much for coming again.
你喜欢吗  那当然012---Did you like it tonight? Absolutely.
尼克点不着火柴时  好搞笑啊012---Wasn't Nick funny when he couldn't get his match lit?
这是一出好戏吧  对吧012---It's a good play, isn't it? Mm.
我很喜欢  你演得很棒012---I loved the play. Uh, yeah, you were great.
尼克也是012---And, uh, Nick, ditto.
很明显  你在跟他做爱012---Clearly, you're having sex with him.
好012---Okay.
很明显  我在跟他做爱012---Clearly, I'm having sex with him?
拜托  太明显了  你们之间没有任何火花012---Oh, come on. It was so obvious. There was no chemistry between you two.
好的  让我先搞清楚012---Okay, let me just get this straight.
你先指责我不忠  又侮辱我的演技012---You're accusing me of cheating on you, and you're insulting my performance?
当然啊  这也难怪我能看到012---You know, I can see how this could happen.
你们每天晚上都光着身体  爱抚  热吻012---You know, you're up there every night, naked, touching, kissing.
那是演戏啊  钱德  这是我的工作012---Acting. Chandler, this is my job.
这是剧中场景  我是在演戏  你怎么可以不相信我012---I'm playing a part in a play. How can you not trust me?
你应该明白  我们就是这样开始的012---Well, you can understand, given how we started.
你居然拿这个来攻击我012---I can't believe you're throwing that in my face.
事实如此  你刚才也没否认012---Well, that is what happened, and I don't even see you denying this.
够了  等你长成熟了再来找我012---I'll tell you what, Chandler. Why don't you call me when you grow up?
好啊  那你可有得时间等了012---Yeah, well, don't expect that to happen any time soon.
噢  我的工作最棒了012---Oh, I have the best job in the entire world.
来了个最帅的帅哥012---The most adorable guy came over today...
我整天都在打扮他012---...and I got to dress him up all day.
瑞秋有新的洋娃娃了012---Rachel has a new doll.
真希望他是  我会把他跟瑞秋娃娃凑在一起012---Oh, I wish he was a doll. Then I could get a Rachel doll and bump them together...
让它们玩亲亲游戏012---...and make kissing noises.
他的名字最好听了  以前我都不觉得  约书亚012---Oh, and he's got the most beautiful name. I never realized. Joshua.
约书…亚012---Oh, Joshua.
约书亚  约书…012---Joshua, Josh.
哈罗012---Uh, hello?

热腾腾的饼干  刚出炉的012---Fresh cookies. Hot from the oven. Ooh!
请用  真好  请012---Please have some. Oh, yo.
我只是在这里闲着  随便弄了一些好吃的012---I've just been fiddling around in here, making delicious treats for everyone.
新的《花花公子》012---Wow. The new Playboy.
我随手买的012---Yeah, just something I picked up.
饼干和黄色书刊  好棒的妈妈012---Cookies and porn? You're the best mom ever.
什么012---What? What?
没什么  约书亚对V字领有些看法  现场听才好玩012---Nothing, it's just something Joshua said about V-necks, but you had to be there.
杰森穿V字领  好看吗012---How does, uh, Jason look in a V-neck?
是约书亚  随便啦012---It's Joshua. Oh, whatever.
等等  那不是要拿走的012---Wait. Wait. This isn't takeout.
讨厌吃饱了就要跑  拜托  别走012---Well, hate to eat and run. No, wait, please don't go.
也有女生看的黄色杂志012---I've got porn for you too.
我不需要012---Yeah, I don't need it.
大家应该呆在这里012---People are supposed to want to hang out here.
为什么  亲爱的  有什么大不了的012---Why? Honey, what is the big deal?
我是女主人012---I'm the hostess.
不是那些臭男生  我一直都是女主人012---Not those guys. I'm always the hostess.
连小的时候  别的女生都会带着她们的新娃娃到我的舞会012---I mean, even when I was little, the girls brought their dollies to my tea party.
我能提供最好的氛围012---I served the best air.
那你干嘛让大家烦恼012---Why did you make a whole big thing...
叫大家去大的地方012---...out of everyone has to hang out in the big apartment?
我想惩罚他们  因为抢走了我们的公寓012---'Cause they took our apartment, I wanted to punish them.
我惩罚完了  他们也吃到苦头了012---But I'm done now. They've suffered enough.
要惩罚他们  就该把他们关在外面012---If you wanted to punish them, you should have just made them hang out here.
那倒是012---Yeah, that's true.
我一定会让这里比对面好十倍012---All right then, when I'm done with this place, it's gonna be ten times better than that place!
我们要捣毁对面吗012---Oh, are we gonna trash their place?
台阶012---Steps.
贱人012---Slut.
你们一定很乐于听到   凯西在跟那个人上床012---You'll all be very happy to hear that Kathy is sleeping with that guy.
真的  你猜对了012---What? So you were right?
我当面问她  她并没有否认012---I confronted her, and she didn't deny it.
我不住这里012---I don't live here.
钱德  她怎么说的012---Chandler. Chandler, what did she say?
等等   你确定吗012---Wait a minute. Come here.are you sure?
我也许是醉了  但我听得懂她的话012---Well, I may be drunk, but I know what she said.
所以我跑去朱理牛排012---So then I went over to Beefsteak Chewley's...
查理牛排   对012---Beefsteak Charlie's? Yes.
你和我总是012---See, you and I have always been like:
哎哟012---Oops.
嘿  需要帮忙吗  不用了012---Hey, do you need help with that? No, I got it.
我感觉好糟  从没这样空虚过012---Oh, I just feel bad. I never vacuum.
嘿   嘿012---Hey. Hey.
今天我和约书亚在一起1小时了  他还没约我出去012---So I was with Joshua for an hour today, and he has not asked me out.
真让人灰心  那你就约他嘛012---It's so frustrating. Why don't you ask him out?
没错  感觉会很刺激012---Oh, yeah. Totally. That's such a turn-on.
真的  看起来感觉不会很饥渴吗012---Really? It doesn't seem desperate?
那样才刺激012---Ooh, that's the turn-on.
他刚离婚  跟女人相处可能会紧张012---He just got a divorce, right? So he's probably really nervous around women.
你就先主动嘛  迈出你的第一步012---You know? Maybe you just need to make the first move.
我以前从没约过男生出去  你没约过男生出去012---I've never asked a guy out before. You've never asked a guy out?
没有  你呢012---No, have you?
上千次了吧012---Thousands of times. Ha, ha.
这也不是什么光荣的事  对吧012---That doesn't make me sound too good, does it?
我都不知道该怎么去做012---I don't even know how I would go about it.
我会从头到尾打量一个女人  然后说012---Oh, what I do is, uh, I look a woman up and down and I say:
嘿012---"Hey.
"你在做什么"012---How you doing?"
拜托012---Oh, please.
嘿012---Hey.
你要怎样做012---How you doing?
好  我也这样做012---You know what? I'm gonna do that.
现在就打电话约他  约他出来012---I'm gonna call him up and I'm gonna ask him out.
好  有什么难的   约就约012---Yeah. I can do that. Ask him out.
你好吗012---"How you doing?"
喂  约书亚012---Hi, Joshua?
瑞秋葛林  布鲁明戴尔的012---It's Rachel Green, from Bloomingdale's.
对了  我想问你是不是012---Yeah, um, I was just wondering if you, um...
是不是012---If you, um...
今天在店里掉了皮夹012---Left your wallet at the store today?
我们捡到一个皮夹  我们012---Oh, well, we found a wallet, and we...
那驾驶证  好主意012---The license? Oh, that is a good idea.
嗯   让我看看   驾照是一位012---Uh, well, let's see. This license belongs to a, uh...
叫菲比先生的012---Uh, belongs to a Mr. Pheebs.
对012---And, um, yeah.
抱歉打扰你了  明天见  拜拜012---So okay. So sorry to bother you at home. I'll see you tomorrow. Bye.
你做过几千次了  我从没做过012---You've done that a thousand times? I've never done that.
天呐  我只是担心他不答应012---Oh, God, I just got so nervous that he was gonna say no.
你得让他无法拒绝  就像  尼克队的球票012---Well, you gotta give him something he can't say no too, like, uh, Knicks tickets.
约他去看尼克队的比赛  他一定会答应012---Invite the guy to a Knicks game. You're guaranteed he'll say yes.
你觉得有用  绝对的  不行  我去行吗012---Really? You think that will work? Absolutely! And if it doesn't, can I get the extra ticket?
什么声音012---What the heck is that?
她有打来吗012---Did she call?
没有  抱歉012---No. Sorry.
也许我应该打给她  不要012---Well, maybe I should call her. No.
忘了她吧  你不需要她的  不必这样啊012---Forget her, man. You don't need her. Don't need that.
没错  她的所作所为让人无法原谅012---He's right. What she did was unforgivable.
对啊  但你要知道  假如是我错了呢012---Well, yeah, but you know, what if I was wrong?
你怎么会错的012---How might you be wrong?
要是她没跟那个人上床呢012---Well, you know, what if she didn't actually sleep with the guy?
大哥  告诉我这是她跟你说的012---Dude, tell me she actually told you this.
她没有  是我看了她的戏感觉他们之间毫无火花012---She did not have to tell me. I saw the play and there was no heat.
罗斯  帮我说句话  你就根据这个012---Back me up here, Ross. That's all your basing this on?
这不是在帮我012---That's not backing me up.
你说过私底下如果有热情012---You said, you know, with the off-stage and the heat...
在台上表演就会没有012---...and the on-stage and the heat... Whoa, whoa.
那只是个理论  很多理论都行不通的012---That was just a theory. There's a lot of theories that didn't pan out.
孤枪侠  共产主义  几何学012---Lone gunman, communism, geometry.
天哪012---Oh, my God.
约书亚  你要不要去看篮球012---"Joshua, Would you like to go to a basketball game with..."
篮球  真有意思  我正好有票012---"You know, it's funny, basketball, because I happen to have tickets to..."
谁喜欢尼克队啊012---"Who likes the Knicks?"
你觉得如何012---What do you think? Oh.
哎  作为一个单身的女人来说…012---Well, as a single woman, who is available...
我觉得你看起来很帅012---...I think you look great.
是吗  没错012---Huh. Yeah? Yup.
真的  帅呆了012---Oh, yeah, you look great.
这样看起来还真配012---Oh, yeah. Yeah, this looks great.
你喜欢吗012---Um, so you like it?
对  很喜欢  实际上  我是想在家里穿的012---I do, I do. I love it. In fact, I think I'm gonna wear it home.
太好了  谢谢你的帮助012---Great. Well, thank you so much for all your help.
我想是的   那就这样012---Well, I guess, uh... I guess this is it. Yeah.
谢了012---Thanks.
或许我春天再过来  找你买泳衣012---Maybe I'll see you in the spring with the... For the bathing suits.
你不现在买吗012---You don't want to do that now?
不买了  改天见012---Oh, that's okay.
希望常常能看到你012---Anyway, hopefully I'll see you around sometime.
篮球012---Basketball.
什么012---Sorry?
我…012---I, uh...
有两张今晚尼克队比赛的球票  如果你感兴趣012---I have two tickets to the Knicks game tonight if you're interested...
谢谢你这星期的惠顾012---...just as a thank-you for this week.
哇  太棒了012---Wow. That would be great.
真的  对啊  那会很精彩的012---Really? Yeah, That would be fantastic.
我外甥最迷尼克队了012---My nephew is crazy about the Knicks.
太棒了  谢谢你  瑞秋012---This is fantastic. Thank you so much, Rachel.
早安  你好012---Good morning. Hi.
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
我只想来跟你说声对不起012---Hey. I just, I just wanted to come over to-to say that I'm sorry.
我真是世上最笨最笨的白痴了012---You know, I acted like the biggest idiot in the world.
我完全明白你为什么这么伤心012---And I can completely understand why you were so upset.
我希望你给我打电话012---I really wish you'd called me.
我知道  我也很后悔012---Yeah, I know. I wish I had too.
不过我觉得这是好事  对吧012---But, you know, I think this is a good thing. You know?
我们吵了第一次架  现在关系有进展了012---Because we've had our first fight, and now we can move on.
至少我确定  我知道的  但是012---You know, I mean, I know for me, but...
尼克的裤子012---Nick's pants?
对012---Yeah.
那好012---Yeah. Well.
看来第二次更大的吵架又要继续了012---I think our second fight is going to be a big one.
好  下次你会怎么说  "我有一张多余的门票"012---Okay, for next time, what do you say? "I have an extra ticket."
"一张多余的门票" 而不是 "两张"  "我有一张多余的门票"012---"An extra ticket." Not "two tickets." I have and extra ticket.
你第一次约男生出去  就被拒绝012---So the first time you asked a guy out he turned you down?
他并没有拒绝我   他参加比赛了012---He didn't turn me down. He's at the game, isn't he?
我约到他了  只是我没去012---I got the date. I'm just not on it.
都弄好了012---Okay, it's ready.
来吧  什么弄好了012---Come on. What's ready?
过来就知道了012---Just come.
哇哦  我的天哪012---Oh, my God.
哇  莫妮卡  好漂亮喔012---Wow. Monica, this is beautiful.
你整整忙了两天012---Oh, did you work for two days straight?
差不多012---Pretty much.
这个地板好不好012---So, what do you think of the floor?
我不知道  看起来一样的012---I don't know. Looks the same.
以前是铺的地毯012---You used to have carpet.
对喔012---Oh, yeah.
我做了点心012---So I made snacks.
你们随便坐012---Please, just hang out, okay?
我要稍微休息一下眼睛012---I'm just gonna rest my eyes for just a little bit.
要我们待会儿再来吗012---Mon, do you want us to come back later?
不  不用  留下来吧  你们继续聊天012---Oh, no, no, no. Stay, stay, stay. Just keep talking.
我一直都是女主人012---I'm always the hostess.
嘿  怎么样012---Hey. How'd it go?
还好  她之前没跟他上床012---So? Well, she wasn't sleeping with him.
太好了  现在有了012---Oh, good. She is now.
你在说什么  我在说她是个恶女人012---What are you saying? I'm saying that she is a devil woman.
你认识她这么个人012---You think you know a person...
才一转身  就跑回去跟尼克上床012---...then they turn around and they sleep with Nick.
尼克和他的大胸肌  还有他的大咪咪012---Nick and his rock-hard pecs and his giant man-nipples.
我恨他  我也恨她012---I hate him. And I hate her.
我不恨她  我爱她  都是我的错  真的012---Well, I don't hate her. I love her. This is all my fault, really.
不会吧  怎么会是你的错012---Oh. How? How is it your fault?
因为我该给她打电话的012---Because, ugh, I should have called.
要是吵完后我马上打给她  她就不会跟尼克出去约会了012---You know, if I'd just called her, she never would have gone out with Nick...
他们也就不会上床了012---...and they wouldn't have ended up in bed together.
是我亲手把她送给他了012---I threw her at his man-nipples.
宝贝  这不是你的错012---Honey, this is not your fault.
就算吵架  她也不该跟别人上床012---Just because you guys had a fight does not justify her sleeping with someone.
除非她以为你们分手了012---Well, if she thought they were on a break...
瑞秋  你的客人掉了皮夹  约书亚伯格012---Rachel, one of your customers seems to have left his billfold. A Joshua Burgen.
