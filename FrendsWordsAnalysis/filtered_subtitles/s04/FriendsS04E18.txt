别说你还想塞东西进来啊012---Oh, well, don't tell me you want to keep more of your stuff in my uterus.
不  不  不  是这样的012---No, no, no. Okay. Now, see. Ahem.
我想给女孩取名莱丝莉012---I want to name the girl baby Leslie.
法兰克想叫其中一个男孩012---And, um, Frank wants to name one of the boy babies...
法兰克二世二世012---...Frank Jr., Jr.
那不就是法兰克三世012---Wouldn't that be Frank III?
说了我就有气012---Don't get me started.
无论如何  既然有三个孩子012---Anyway, um, since there are three babies...
我们起了其中的两个012---...and, um, we both got to put our names in...
我们非常荣幸  想请你替另一个男孩命名012---...we would be truly honored if you would name the other boy baby.
哇啊 哦012---Oh, wow.
好棒  太好了012---That's so nice. Oh, oh! Ha, ha.
美洲狮012---Cougar.
你再想一下012---You think about it.
老友记  第四季  第18集  瑞秋的新装012---Friends S04E18  The One With Rachel's New Dress
我有一件胸罩还在晾着呢012---I left a bra drying on the shower rod.
你儿子会不会以为那是你的  而心灵受创012---You don't think your son will think it's yours and be traumatized?
妈咪可以有老婆  爸比就可以有胸罩012---Hey, Mommy can have a wife. Daddy can have a bra.
该走了012---Oh, it's time to go.
不  不  不  那钟有点快的012---Oh, no, no, no. See, that clock's a little fast.
我们还有17分钟012---Uh, we still have 17 minutes.
什么事可以在17分钟内012---Huh. What can we do in 17 minutes...
做两次012---...twice?
哎  你的野心真大012---Well, that's ambitious.
别理它  是卡萝带你儿子来了012---Okay, you can ignore that. That's Carol with your son.
相信我  他长大点的话就会明白了012---Uh, believe me, when he's older, he'll understand.
罗斯   马上来012---Ross. I'll be right there.
你好  嗨012---Hello. Hello. Hey. Hi.
艾蜜莉   这是卡萝和苏珊012---Uh, Emily, this is Carol and Susan.
总算见到你  我也是012---Hey, it's so nice to finally meet you. You too.
苏珊下星期要去伦敦拍广告012---Susan's gonna be shooting a commercial in London next week.
我好兴奋  还没去过012---I'm so excited. I've never been there.
我可以带你到处去  太好了012---Oh, well, I'll show you around. Great.
我还想看秀  你有什么建议012---Also, I was hoping to catch a show. So if you can make any suggestions...
有很多都很棒的012---Oh, there's tons of terrific stuff.
我陪你去012---I'll go with you. Oh.
对不起012---Oh, I'm sorry.
你们可真聊得来012---Oh. Look at you two bonding.
去机场都快来不及了  你没事吧012---Making us late for the airport so... Are you all right?
他没事  没事  他不喜欢我们相处得好012---Oh, he's fine, he's fine. It's just us getting along is difficult for him...
因为他不喜欢我012---...because he doesn't like me.
拜托   没错012---Ha, ha. Come on. That's...
是真的012---It's true.
嗨   名字想好了吗012---Hi. Hey. Hey, do we have a baby name yet?
还没有  好难喔012---Ugh, no. It's so hard.
翻遍了这本书也找不到012---I went through this whole book and found nothing.
我想取个勇猛而有自信的名字012---I want a name that's really, like, you know, strong and confident.
例如爱克爽012---You know? Like Exxon.
很适合瓦尔迪兹的小孩012---Well, it certainly worked for that Valdez kid.
菲比  你要勇猛的名字  绿巨人怎么样012---Oh, oh, Pheebs. You want a strong name? How about The Hulk?
不  不喜欢绿巨人012---No, I'm not sure about Hulk...
不过我喜欢什么"人"的012---...but I like the idea of a name starting with "The."
想取好名字  就取乔伊012---Well, you want a good name, heh, go with Joey.
乔伊是好朋友  好兄弟012---Joey's your pal, Joey's your buddy.
人都在哪里  都跟乔伊一起出去了012---Where is everybody? They're hanging out with Joey.
知道什么啊  要取乔伊012---Know what? If you're gonna name him Joey...
还不如取钱德012---...you should name him Chandler.
少来啊  钱德风趣  世故  一旦了解他012---Oh, come on, Chandler's funny, he's sophisticated, and he's very lovable...
就会觉得他很可爱012---...once you get to know him.
乔伊也很可爱012---Hey, Joey's lovable too.
重要的是当你需要乔伊  他就会出现012---But the thing about Joey is, if you need him, he'll be there.
钱德也会出现  只是会慢一点012---Chandler will be there for you too. I mean, he might be a little late...
不过他一定会出现  而且还会带冰汽水过来012---...but he'll be there. And he'll bring you some cold soda...
如果你在很热的时候需要他的话012---...if what you need him for is that you're really hot.
你觉得呢  你觉得呢012---What do you say? What do you say?
跟心爱的人同名的想法很好012---Well, I like the idea of naming him after someone I love.
而且乔伊和钱德都是很棒的名字012---And Joey and Chandler are both great names.
但是我不想012---All right, I don't...
或者就叫绿巨人好了012---Maybe I will just name him The Hulk.
我真不该提起我想给我的孩子起名012---I knew I shouldn't have mentioned it. That's what I wanted to name my kid.
嗨  莫妮卡  如果你今晚想和约书亚睡012---Hey, Mon? If you were hoping to sleep with Joshua for the first time tonight...
你会挑哪件012---...which one of these would you want to be wearing?
我觉得帮别人挑性感睡衣很怪012---You know what? It really creeps me out choosing other people's sex clothes.
对不起  我太兴奋了012---Sorry. I'm just so excited.
我等了好几个月了  我还跑去染发012---I've been waiting for this for months. I got my hair colored.
我买了新鞋子  还帮他煮大餐012---I got new sheets. I'm making him a very fancy meal.
看我给他准备了什么012---What am I making him, by the way?
什锦沙拉  有羊酪  松子012---Well, you're making him a fris¨¦e salad with goat cheese and pine nuts...
菰米饭  烤庐笋和鲑鱼面包丁012---...wild rice, roasted asparagus and salmon en croute.
我不是要做腓力牛排吗012---I thought I was making him filet mignon.
本来是  但餐厅的鲑鱼有剩   所以你决定煮鲑鱼012---Yeah, you were, but you decided to make salmon because you had some left over.
然后你想到要是你抱怨   "你"就不会煮了012---And then you realized if you bitched about it, then you would stop cooking...
你就得上烤马铃薯加健怡可乐012---...and you would have to make your famous baked potato and Diet Coke.
"我" 煮菜时火气可真大012---Wow, I really get crabby when I cook.
嘿   嘿012---Hey. Hey.
嘿012---Hey.
艾蜜莉昨晚打电话来012---So, uh, Emily called last night.
你现在才转告我012---And now you're giving me the message?
结果艾蜜莉爱死苏珊了012---Turns out that Emily is just crazy about Susan.
她们一起去看戏012---Yeah. They're going to the theater together.
她们一起吃晚饭012---They're going to dinner.
她们一起去骑马012---They're going horseback riding.
苏珊真会玩012---God, Susan is so fun.
好像这个太相似了一点012---Look, this is just a little too familiar.
我和卡萝分手前整整半年012---Okay, for, like, six months before Carol and I split up...
我整天只听到 "我朋友苏珊好聪明012---...all I heard was, "My friend Susan is so smart.
我朋友苏珊好风趣  我朋友苏珊好棒"012---My friend Susan is so funny. My friend Susan is so great."
你觉得艾蜜莉和苏珊之间会擦出火花012---You actually think that something could happen between Emily and Susan?
她们都一起上健身房了012---Hey, they're going to the gym together.
两个女人012---Two women...
劈腿012---...stretching.
她们洗蒸汽浴  开始互相逗弄012---You know, they take a steam together, things get a little playful.
你们没看过《登峰造极》吗012---Didn't you see Personal Best?
没  但我一定要看012---No, but I'm gonna.
先生  你疯了012---Hi. Hi. You're crazy.
她是艾蜜莉   艾蜜莉是异性恋012---Okay, this is Emily. Emily is straight.
你怎么知道012---How do you know?
我们结婚前原以为卡萝是异性恋012---I mean, we thought Carol was straight before I married her.
我肯定  不喜欢罗斯这个名字012---Yeah, definitely. I don't like the name Ross.
你落井下石的方式还真怪012---What a weird way to kick me when I'm down.
我是说宝宝的名字012---No, no, I just meant for the baby.
罗斯有什么不好012---What's wrong with Ross?
就像绿巨人012---It's just, you know, something like this...
就不会遇上这种事吗012---...would never happen to The Hulk, you know.
谁说的  那不真实012---Actually, that's not true.
《绿巨人》第72集里  布鲁斯班纳博士发现012---In The Incredible Hulk, number 72, Dr. Bruce Banner found...
难以置信  我女朋友是同性恋012---You know, never mind. My girlfriend's a lesbian.
所以我决定取名字不是乔伊就是钱德012---So I decided I'm definitely gonna go with either Joey or Chandler.
啊哦  啊哦012---Oh. oh, oh, oh.
你一定要选乔伊012---You gotta pick Joey.
有哪个名人叫钱德012---I mean, name one famous person named Chandler.
雷蒙钱德勒  你捏造的人不算012---Raymond Chandler. Someone you didn't make up.
叫乔伊的才没有名人  除了012---Okay, there are no famous Joeys. Except for, heh...
乔伊巴塔富寇012---...Joey Buttafuoco.
他的确是我们的心头之痛012---Yeah, that guy really hurt us. Yeah.
那这样  加起来除以二如何012---Well, how about a compromise then? Okay, what if it's...
例如  钱道伊012---...you know, Chan-no-ey?
乔伊  你想嘛  他绝对当不上总统012---Okay, look, Joey? Come on, think about it. He'll never be president.
绝对不会出现乔伊总统012---I mean, there's never gonna be a President Joey.
听着  我本来不想提的012---All right, look, I didn't want to bring this up.
但钱德是我听过最蠢的名字012---But Chandler is the stupidest name I've heard in my life.
它根本不是名字  连个词都不是012---It's not even a name. It's barely even a word.
它有点接近钱包  但又不是012---Okay, it's kind of like chandelier but it's not.
它是个蠢到爆的名字  笨蛋  它不是名字012---All right? It's a stupid, stupid, non-name.
你说得对  我的名字烂透了012---You're right. I have a horrible, horrible name.
对不起  我不是  对不起012---I'm sorry, man. I didn't... I'm sorry.
所以我想就该用乔伊012---So I guess it's Joey, then. I mean...
真好  谢谢你这么费心012---This is so nice. Thank you for doing this.
别客气  烹饪能舒缓我的心012---Oh. Please. Cooking soothes me.
吃吧  好的012---So dig in. All right.
看起来都很好吃012---Well, it all looks so good. Mm.
天哪012---Oh, my God.
我知道  天哪  这个饭好012---Oh, I know. My God, this rice is so...
我的手艺真好012---I am so good.
你后面012---Behind you.
没事  他们以前就住这里  有时会迁徙回来012---Oh, yeah, sorry. They used to live here, and sometimes they migrate back over.
能不能让他们不要在这里012---Is there, uh...? Is there some way that they could, uh, not be here?
只是  我最怕家禽了012---It's just that, uh, farm birds really kind of freak me out.
啊  好的012---Yeah. Okay, okay.
出去  出去012---Here we go. Here we go. Whoa.
哇啊  抱歉012---Whoa. Oh, sorry.
出去012---There you go.
耶  你们怎么会敲门012---Hey. How'd you do that?
进来012---Come on.
都走了012---All gone. Heh.
只是敏感家禽  是吧012---So, farm birds, huh?
我只有这个怪癖   我发誓012---Yeah, it's my only weird thing, I swear.
我该已经告诉过你了  但我不知道这里会有鸡鸭012---And I would have told you about it but I didn't know that they'd be here.
要不要来点012---So can I serve you a little...
怎么了  怎么了012---What, what, what?
没事  只是我知道它们还在外面012---Nothing. Uh, it's just that I know that they're still out there.
他们在对门  隔着两道墙012---They're across the hall. I mean, that's two doors away.
它们要啄很久才能把墙啄穿  过来012---It's gonna take them a long time to peck their way back over here.
一点也不好笑012---That's not funny.
是吗  要不012---Uh... Okay, you know...
要不换个地方  会让你好受点012---Would you feel better if we went someplace else?
我们可以把东西打包去你家012---I mean, we could pack all this stuff up and, you know, go to your apartment.
我家正在装修   一团混乱012---Oh, they're working on it this week. It's a mess.
不过  我们可以去我父母家012---But, uh, I'm staying at my parents' house. We could go there.
你父母家  他们出国了012---Your parents'? They're out of town.
对012---Oh.
那里地方很大  视野很宽阔012---It's a huge place, and it's got this gorgeous view of the park.
会非常  非常地浪漫012---It'd be very, very romantic.
你觉得如何  好啊012---What do you say? Yeah, that works.
它们闻得出恐惧012---They can smell the fear.
嗨012---Hey.
班好吗012---How's Ben?
我问他吃不吃东西  他说不要012---Well, I asked him if he wanted to eat. He said no.
我问他要不要睡觉  他说不要012---I asked him if he wanted to sleep. He said no.
我问他想做什么  他说不要012---I asked what he wanted to do. He said no.
所以他在扫地012---So he's sweeping.
嘿  宝贝012---Hey, buddy. Hey.
有苏珊的消息吗012---So, um, any word from Susan?
她说她跟艾蜜莉玩得很开心012---Ooh, yeah, she said she's having so much fun with Emily.
对了  你有没有想过012---Uh, by the by, did it ever occur to you that...
她们或许玩的太开心了一点012---...I don't know, maybe they might be having a little too much fun?
什么叫太开心012---What's too much fun?
我们结婚时  你和苏珊的那种闲心012---You know, the kind of fun you and Susan had when we were married.
天哪  你还真会乱想012---Oh, my God. You are so paranoid.
是  是吗012---Am I? Yes.
是吗012---Am I?
艾蜜莉我不知道012---I can't speak for Emily...
但苏珊和我的关系很稳定012---...but Susan is in a loving, committed relationship.
卡萝  我们也是012---Uh-huh. Carol, so were we.
你想像一下012---All right, just imagine for a moment...
苏珊认识了别人  然后一拍即合012---...that Susan meets someone, and they really hit it off.
她们从剧院回来012---Say they're coming back from the theater...
然后去酒吧喝个小酒012---...and they stop at a pub for a couple of drinks.
有说有笑012---They're laughing, you know.
有人有意无意地碰了另外一个人012---Someone innocently touches someone else.
就会有火花012---There's electricity.
那感觉很新鲜  很刺激012---It's new. It's exciting.
你敢说完全没有可能...012---Are you telling me there isn't even the slightest possibility...
...出事012---...of something happening?
或许有  天哪012---Maybe. Oh, my God.
听你说我才真的有些信了012---I didn't really believe it until you just said it.
别的小朋友都不信  但我发誓  那只鸭子真的推了我012---None of the other kids believed me, I swear to God, that duck pushed me.
哇  这地方真豪华012---Wow. This place is fabulous.
我带你参观  这是楼下的客厅012---Yeah, let me show you around. This is the downstairs living room.
这有两个客厅012---There's two living rooms?
天啊  你靠这里把到好多美眉吧012---God, growing up here, this place must have been a real babe magnet.
啊  应该会  但我父母刚搬来012---Yeah, well, it would have been, but, uh, my parents just moved here.
你一定靠这里把到了很多美眉012---Well, you should know this place is a real babe magnet.
要亲热吗012---Want to make out?
这样吧  我干吗不把东西先放进冰箱里012---You know, here's an idea. Why don't I put the food in the fridge...
等我们待会儿再吃012---...and we can eat it later?
听起来不错012---That sounds like a plan. Heh.
哪里可以让我梳洗一下012---Um, is there a place that I could go freshen up?
有   直走左边第二个门012---Oh, yeah. Yeah. Um, just down the hall and, uh, second door to your left.
儿子  爸妈  你们怎么回来了012---Oh, hi, darling. Mom, Dad, what are you guys doing here?
我们提前结束行程  法国烂透了012---Oh, we cut the trip short. France sucks.
现在情况有点特殊   我带了人回来012---Um, this may be a little weird, but I've got a date here.
了解012---Say no more.
我们拿了吃的  就上楼不妨碍你012---We'll just grab some food, take it with us upstairs and be out of your hair.
那就好  所以你们也不去意大利了012---Oh, that'd be great. So you didn't even get to Italy?
没有  意大利也烂012---Yep. Sucks.
你来了012---Hi, you.
啊  天哪012---Oh, my God.
我知道  我不只会做菜012---I know. I can do more than cook.
我喜欢她  她似乎很聪明012---I like her. She seems smart.
瑞秋  我爸妈012---Rachel, my parents.
很高兴认识你们  哈罗  哈罗012---So nice to meet you. Hello, hello.
约书亚  那5百元是给你买日用品的012---Oh, Joshua, that $500 was for groceries.
什么  这不  你们误会了012---What, this? Oh, no. That's not what it is.
我在时装界工作012---Okay, I work in fashion.
实际上  这才是正式的时装012---See, and this is a real dress, actually.
米兰正在流行012---They're wearing it in Milan.
所以我也必须试穿衣服  观察一般人的反应012---So part of my job is to wear the clothes and then I see how people respond.
然后汇报给布鲁明戴尔的上司012---And then I report back to my superiors at Bloomingdale's, so...
不过这次012---And obviously, in this case...
我显然得汇报说012---...I am going to report back:
"美国  尚嫌大胆"012---"U.S.A. Not ready."
洛杉矶或许可以012---Maybe in L.A. Yes.
有道理  你们吃过饭了吗012---There you go. So have you kids eaten yet?
我们想等事后  不是012---Well, ahem, we were going to do that after. I mean, um...
接着  正好  我们也饿死了012---Next. Well, we're starving.
不如大家一起出去吃吧012---Why don't we just all go get something to eat?
也好  穿着它窝在家里太可惜了012---Yeah, well, ha, ha, no use wasting this baby just lying around the house.
所以我们去吃饭  对啊012---So we'll go eat. Yeah.
你就穿那样012---You'll wear that.
我们去吃饭  你就穿那样吃饭012---We'll be eating and, of course, you'll be wearing that.
我为我说的话道歉012---Dude, I am sorry about what I said.
不  不  你说得对 这个名字太可笑了012---Nope, nope, you're right. It is a ridiculous name.
也没那么糟   当然有了012---It's not that bad. Yes, it is.
从现在开始  我只有姓没有名了012---From now on, I have no first name.
你就叫宾012---So you're just Bing?
我无名无姓012---I have no name.
那我们要叫你什么012---So, what are we supposed to call you?
好  你们就暂时叫我…012---Okay, uh, for now, temporarily, you can call me...
克林顿012---...Clint.
你才不够酷叫 "克林顿"012---No way are you cool enough to pull off "Clint."
那我可以叫什么012---Okay, so, what name am I cool enough to pull off?
嗯  金012---Um, Gene.
克林顿  就是克林顿012---It's Clint. It's Clint.
金  再见  金  再见012---See you later, Gene. Bye, Gene.
是克林顿   克林顿012---It's Clint. Clint!
金有什么不好012---What's up with Gene?
你穿你的睡衣去吃饭   没错012---You wore your nightie to dinner? Oh, yeah.
最精彩的是  我背后被服务生泼到水时012---And the best part though, was when the waiter spilled water down my back.
我一跳  咪咪就弹了出来012---I jumped up and my boob popped out.
哇  天啊  不012---Oh, my God. Oh, no.
好惨  没关系  我的胸型很漂亮012---Yeah, it's all right. I got nice boobs.
我刚收到艾蜜莉的留言012---So I just picked up a message from Emily.
她要和苏珊要一起去读诗会012---She and Susan are going to a poetry reading together.
所以呢  所以呢012---So? So?
诗012---Poetry?
苏珊是同志012---Susan's gay.
她们志同道合012---They're being gay together.
艾蜜莉是异性恋  你醒醒吧012---Emily's straight. Oh, wake up.
哇012---Wow.
卡萝真的把你害惨了012---Carol really messed you up.
你说什么012---Excuse me?
她害你变成不信任别人   疯疯癫癫爱吃醋012---She turned you into this untrusting, crazy, jealous sycophant.
我不知道爱吃醋是什么  但其他都没说错012---All right, so I don't know what "sycophant" means, but the rest is right.
我不知道你要说啥  我哪有疯疯癫癫爱吃醋012---I don't know what you're talking about. I am not a crazy, jealous person.
什么   她说得没错012---What? She's totally right.
我们以前  你老爱吃马克的醋012---When we were together, you got all freaked out about Mark...
其实根本没事  有道理012---...and there was nothing going on. This makes sense.
才怪012---It does not.
当然有道理  高中时你每个女友都不忠012---Sure it does. In high school, you weren't jealous at all...
你也没吃过醋012---...even though all your girlfriends were cheating on you.
直到92  93年 他都很信任别人012---All right, so up until '92, '93, he was very trusting.
然后94年  卡萝离开他  砰  纽约鬼影幢幢012---Then '94 hit, Carol left him, and bam. Paranoid City.
是的012---Yeah.
就是这样  就是这样012---Absolutely, absolutely.
好好玩012---This is so much fun.
一点也不好玩012---This is not fun.
我们只想说012---Look, all we're trying to say is...
别让你和卡萝的事  破坏你和艾蜜莉的感情012---...don't let what happened with Carol ruin what you've got with Emily.
92年的罗斯就不会012---The '92 Ross wouldn't.
我还是觉得马克定有问题012---I still think I was right about that whole Mark thing, though.
什么  你知道吗   我希望艾蜜莉是同志012---Wha...? Well, you know what? I hope Emily is a lesbian.
击鼓012---Drum roll.
行了  行了012---Okay. Okay.
这样012---All right.
帮个忙  我是马克还是约翰012---Help. Am I a Mark or a John?
你当马克不够高012---Ehh, you're not tall enough to be a Mark.
你或许可以当个好巴尼012---But you might make a good Barney.
拜托  我是认真的012---All right, look, I am serious.
明天3点半我就要上法院012---Tomorrow at 3:30, I'm going to the courthouse.
你真的要改名012---You're actually going through with this?
这个名字拖累了我一辈子012---Hey, look, this name has been holding me back my entire life.
害的我被其他小朋友找喳  女人运也很差012---Okay, it's probably why kids picked on me in school, and why I never do well with women.
明天4点起  我不是马克约翰森  就是约翰马克森012---So as of 4:00 tomorrow, I'm either gonna be Mark Johnson or John Markson.
你的问题在于你自己   与名字无关012---You've got problems because of you, not your name.
别再闹了  钱德这个名字很棒012---This has got to stop. Chandler is a great name.
事实上012---In fact...
好012---Yes.
对不起  我知道你希望宝宝叫乔伊012---I'm sorry, I know you really wanted me to name the baby Joey.
但我要  我要让他叫钱德012---But... So I'm gonna name the baby Chandler.
真的012---Really?
对  但你也得保留这个名字012---Yeah, but you have to keep the name too.
好  谢了012---Okay, thanks. Okay.
要不要抱下  好012---You want to hug it out? Yeah.
我现在就去告诉法兰克他们012---Okay, I'm gonna go tell Frank and Alice right now.
好的012---Okay.
菲比  再见  再见012---Bye, Pheebs. Okay, bye.
004班机已到达17号门012---Flight 004 is now arriving at Gate 17.
很棒的行李箱  我正要说012---Nice luggage. I was going to say.
