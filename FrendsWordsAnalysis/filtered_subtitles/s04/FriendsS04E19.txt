他也会戴耳环吗012---He does that?
不知道   管他呢012---I don't know. Whatever. Ha, ha.

就多一天  求你别再引诱我了012---One more day. Please don't do this to me again.
我也想啊  但我耽误了好多工作  会被开除的012---You know I'd stay, but I've already missed so much work. They'll fire me.
那样  你就可以想待多久就待多久了012---So? Then you could stay as long as you want.
真是那样就好了012---I wish I could.
不  不要  不要收拾啊012---Oh, no, don't... Don't... Don't start packing.

我不是现在就走012---I don't think you understand packing.
我只是不想临走时再收拾012---I don't want to leave it till the last minute.
上次走的太匆忙   结果把我的短裤忘在这里了012---Last time I packed in a rush, I left my knickers here.
我知道  我试着偷穿了一下012---Yeah, I know. I, uh, tried them on.

你们有票012---You have tickets?
我妈离婚时分到我爸赛季的票   就送给我了012---Yeah, my mom got my dad's season tickets in the divorce, so she gave them to me.
很显然  座位相当的好012---Apparently, they're good seats.
天哪  几乎就在球场边上012---Oh, my God! Those are almost on the floor!
你们想要吗012---Do you guys want these?
废话  想  当然想012---Yeah! Yeah, we do!

太好了  只要把公寓这里还给我们就行了012---All right! Just give us our apartment back.
想不到有这一招012---Whoa, I didn't see that coming.
你是说真的012---Are you serious?
拜托  我们知道这票值多少012---Come on. We know what these are worth.
你们以为我们是白痴吗012---Do you think we're stupid?
不是白痴  你们比我们想像的要狡猾多了012---Not stupid. You're meaner than I thought.
怎么样  想都别想012---What do you say? Forget it.
我才不会为了几张篮球票  放弃我的单身公寓012---Okay? I'm not giving up my bachelor pad for some basketball seats!
你的 "单身公寓"012---Your "bachelor pad"?
你有女孩住过这吗012---Have you even had a girl here?

季票  你知道那代表什么012---Season tickets! You know what that means?
别想了  我绝不让出公寓012---Forget it. I'm not giving up the apartment.
小时候  我爸的公司都会送季票012---Oh come—look,When I was a kid, my dad's company gave season tickets...
给业绩第一的业务员  我爸从来没拿到过012---...to the Number 1 salesman every year. All right? My dad never won.
不过  他也不在业务部  但我还是一直耿耿于怀012---Of course, he wasn't in sales. But still, I never ever, ever forgot that!
你们在啊  嘿012---Hey guys! Hey.
天哪012---Oh, my God.
我们开你的玩笑还不够吗012---We don't make enough fun of you already?
艾蜜莉说服我去穿的012---Oh, yeah. Emily convinced me to do it.
你知道《轰》合唱团解散了吧012---You do know that Wham broke up?
我喜欢  艾蜜莉也喜欢  这点最重要012---I like it. And Emily likes it. And that's what counts.
你们怎么样012---So, uh, how are you guys doing?
不要觉得戴了耳环还能算正常012---Don't try and talk all normal with that thing in your ear.
艾蜜莉呢012---Where's Emily?
去跟她舅舅道别去了012---Ugh, she's saying goodbye to her uncle.
她不喜欢住这吗  对  对啊012---Didn't she, like, just get here? Yeah! Yeah.
别激动  大哥012---Easy, tiger.
我真的很讨厌这样012---I just hate this so much.
每次去机场接她  我都好开心012---Every time I go pick her up at the airport, it's so great.
但是我又会想  "过两天又要送她来机场了"012---But I'm thinking, "I'll be right back in a couple of days, dropping her off."
那你要怎么办  也没办法012---So, what'll you do? There's nothing to do.
她住那  我住这012---She lives there. I live here.
她得搬来这里012---She'd have to move here.
她应该搬来这里012---She should move here.
什么012---What?
我可以叫她跟我住  你说真的吗012---I can ask her to live with me. Are you serious?
为什么不  我说  为什么不  你们才认识六个星期012---Why not? I mean, why not? You've only known her six weeks!
我冰箱里有盒牛奶放得比你们这个还更久012---I've got a carton of milk in my fridge I've had a longer relationship with.
听着  我跟她在一起时  就像012---Look, guys, when I'm with her, it's like...
她会激发出我最好的一面012---Uh, she brings out this great side of me.
我的意思是  我爱她  你知道吗012---I mean, I love her, you know?
我也爱那盒牛奶012---And I love the milk!
但我不会让某个英国女生搬来和我住012---But I won't ask some British girl to move in with me.
乔伊  现在该你说了012---Joey, you say things now.
罗斯  他说得对  艾蜜莉很棒012---Look, Ross. He's right. Emily's great.
她很棒012---She's great!
但这样太快了  你只会吓到她012---But this is too soon. You're only gonna scare her.
我不想吓到她  没错012---I don't wanna do that. No.
你不想搞砸了  就别太心急012---You don't want to wreck it. Don't go too fast.
你们说得对  我知道  你们是对的012---No. You're right. I know, you're right.
我不会这样做的012---I'm not going to do it.
谢了  两位  不客气012---Thanks guys. No problem.
记得要走时摇它两下 （《轰》所唱的歌词）012---Just remember to wake us up before you go-go.
太难了  太难了012---It's too hard. Too hard!
好了  两位  最后的机会012---All right, boys. Last chance for the tickets.
否则  我就送给我的新男友  约书亚012---Otherwise, I give them to my new boyfriend, Joshua.
不用了  谢谢012---No, thank you.
等一下  拜托  跟她们换啦012---Wait, wait. Come on, come on! Let's trade.
时机正好  我刚把马桶给堵住了012---The timing's perfect! I just clogged the toilet!
我跟你一样想要球票  但住过这里012---Look, I want those basketball seats as much as you do! Okay, but we can't leave in the small apartment...
就觉得对面太小了  你看过 "献给阿尔吉侬的花束"吗012---...after we've lived here! Ever read Flowers for Algernon?
有012---Yes.
你看过 "运动画报" 吗012---Ever read Sports Illustrated?
没有  我没偷看过你的012---No, I didn't read yours!
我们今晚就可以去看球012---We can go to the game tonight!
她们提出比季票更好的东西012---The only way I'll consider this...
我才要考虑012---...is if they offer more than just season seats.
是 "尼克队"  去他的 "尼克队"012---It's the Knicks! Screw the Knicks.
我不是那个意思  我是说012---I didn't mean that. I just meant...
这层公寓的价值要更大012---...that the apartment is worth so much more.
"尼克队"万岁012---And the Knicks rule all.
对  "尼克队"万岁012---Yeah, the Knicks rule all!
嘿  怎么样  要不要012---Hey, so? Are you going to do it?
不要  因为这个交易不公平012---No. No. We're not gonna do that, y'know why? Because its not an even trade.
好吧  听着012---All right, look.
要是你们能保住公寓  又拿到球票呢012---What if you could keep the apartment and the tickets?
成交012---Done!
让我说完  我是说我们来打赌  赢家才行012---Let me finish. I'm talking about a bet. Winner takes all.
我们可能输光012---Ooh, we could get nothing.
也可能满载而归  我喜欢012---Or you can end up with everything. Oh, I like that.
怎么样012---What do you say?
不要  赌了啦012---No! Just do it!
真有说服力啊012---Oh! Oh, I'm convinced!
拜托啦  我也会为你这么做012---Come on, man! You know I'd do it for you.
因为你是我最好的朋友012---Because you're my best friend.
好吧  但你一整年不准再用这招012---All right. But you can't use that again for a whole year.
我赌了012---I'm in.
好兴奋喔  你们要赌什么012---This is so exciting! What are you going to bet?
好吧  我们让菲比决定012---Okay. Well, we should let Phoebe decide...
因为只有她没有利害关系  而且她好美012---...because she's the only one who's impartial, and she's so pretty.

这根本不是比赛012---That's not even a game.
闭嘴  我们领先012---Shut up. We're winning!
你们想速战速决  我们就抽牌012---You want to finish this? We get a deck of cards.
