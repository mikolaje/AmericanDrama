真不敢相信我居然跑来修指甲012---I'm can't believe I'm getting my nails done.
你还说很好玩的012---And you said it was gonna be fun.
是有点好玩012---Which it kind of is.
还有  你说会有别的男人来的  哪有啊012---Also, you said there would be other guys here. There are no other guys here!
钱德  那边就有个男的  那是快递012---Chandler, there's a guy right over there. That's a mailman.
他也跑我们公司012---That's our mailman.
嗨  你好啊012---Hi, how are you?
钱德  放心  这样无损于你的男子气概012---Chandler, don't worry. This doesn't make you any less of a guy.
那样会012---That does.
我坐到什么012---What am I sitting on?
我可不敢去想这个女人是抓哪儿  搞断自己指甲的012---Heh. I'd hate to think what this woman was scratching when this broke off.
你知道从前谁也戴那种指甲吗  不知道012---Hey, you know who used to have nails like that? No.
我…的…天哪012---Oh, my God.
老友记  第四季  第15集  橄榄球012---Friends S04E05  The One With All The Rugby
乔伊  问个问题  它快让我疯掉了012---Joey, let me ask you a question. This has been driving me crazy.
这个开关是干嘛用的  哦  没用啊012---What does this light switch do? Oh, nothing.
没用的开关  你一点儿都不在意么012---Didn't it drive you crazy to have a switch and not know what it did?
我知道啊  没用012---I know what it did. Nothing.
它存在就一定有功用012---They wouldn't have put it there if it didn't do something.
你怎么能不在意呢  就像这样012---How can you not care? Like this:
还有一个问题012---Well, here's another question for you.
你知道马桶上银色水龙头把手的功用吗012---Do you know what that little silver knob on the toilet does?
当然知道  冲水  很好012---Sure. It flushes it. Okay, good.
既然你知道  到我们那边来的时候  请你冲一下好吗012---Now, since you know, when you come over, would you mind actually using it?
哈罗  嘿012---Hello. Hey. Aah!
我的天啊  猜猜我们今天遇见谁了012---Oh, my God. Wow. Guess who we ran into today?
珍妮丝  太奇妙了012---Janice. Is this amazing?
你最近好吗  还行  我离婚了012---How have you been? Well, um, I'm divorced.
喔  真的吗012---Wow. Really?
真的  正在靠离婚赡养费过活012---Yeah, I'm riding the alimony pony.
又是这套012---And there it is.
我只是过来打声招呼  嗨  大家好012---I just came up to say hi. Hi.
还有你  亲爱的  我们待会见  好012---You, sweetie, I'll see you later. Okay.
晚上见  好012---Mwah. I'll see you tonight.
再见  再见  再见012---Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye.
再见  再见  再见012---Bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Oh.
我受不了这个女人012---I can't stand the woman.
什么  我还以为你爱死她了呢012---What? I thought you were crazy about her.
我知道  但是我们相爱之前她就有的那些很烦的小毛病012---I know, you know all those little annoying things she did before we fell in love?
比如她的声音  笑声还有她的性格012---like her voice and her laugh and her personality?
现在  全都回来了  你看012---Well, they're all back, you know.
而且还多了起码九种新的012---And she's picked up like nine new ones.
那你干嘛带她来  你虐待其他人012---So, what are you doing bringing her here? There's people here.
放心  我今晚会搞定012---Don't worry about it. I'm taking care of it tonight.
会才怪  你一直跟她纠缠不清012---You are not. You have never been able to break up with her.
这次我不必跟她分手012---Well, I don't have to break up with her this time.
我们又没在一起   我会先发制人012---We're not involved. I'm gonna do a preemptive strike.
我会在开始前就结束掉012---I'm gonna end it with her before it starts.
我的屁股好冰012---My ass is, like, frozen.
塞进冷冻库二十分钟试试看012---Yeah, try sticking it in the freezer for 20 minutes.
不要不信012---I'm telling you.
你居然敢晚上自己走在路上012---I can't believe you really walk alone here at night.
我是说  纽约的传闻好多012---I mean, you hear such stories about New York.
其实没那么糟的012---No, it's really not that bad.
我一个人的时候也感觉很安全啊012---I mean, I, for one, feel perfectly safe.
救命啊   救命啊  救命啊012---Help! Help! Help!
罗斯  没事  他们是我在英国的朋友012---No, no, no, Ross. Ross, these are friends of mine from home.
连恩  戴文  这是罗斯012---Liam, Devon, this is Ross. Oh. Heh.
老兄  你们好012---Hi, mate. Hey.
你还好吧012---How are you, man? Ha, ha.
喔  哦  我装得不错吧  "救命啊  救命啊"012---Oh hey, that was a good one, huh? I was like, "Help! Help!"
最近怎么样啊012---So how are you?
刚到我就想给你们打电话来着012---I've been meaning to ring you ever since I arrived...
但是  一直就比较忙了012---...but, um, well, I've been rather busy.
你想想  那次U2演唱会之后我们就没见过了012---Do you realize we have not seen each other since the night of that U2 concert?
天哪  噢  是呀  就是012---Ah. Oh, my God, I think you're right.
实际上  应该说是演唱会第二天早上之后就再没见过面012---Well, actually, the last time you and I saw each other was the next morning.
噢  是  连恩012---Ha, ha. Oh, Liam.
噢  是  连恩012---Heh. Oh, Liam.
你们在玩足球吗012---So, what, were you guys playing soccer or something?
或者该叫它012---Or should I call it...
"踢"足球012---..."football"? Uh...
我们在打橄榄球012---We were playing rugby.
明天碰巧在公园里就有球赛  你愿意的话  欢迎参加012---In fact, we're playing a game at the park tomorrow. You're welcome to play too if you want.
罗斯打橄榄球  我不敢想象012---Ha, ha. Ross play rugby? I don't think so.
呵  怎么012---Heh. What?
有什么可笑的012---What's so funny about that?
我是说  你是美国人012---Well, I mean, you're American to start with.
你们这里没有橄榄球012---You don't really have rugby here.
我们也是到了1776年  才自由独立012---Heh. Well, we didn't have freedom here until 1776 either, so...
那好  说定了  明天2点公园见012---So good then. We'll see you at Riverside Park at 2:00!
干杯  干杯012---Cheers. Cheers.
天哪  亲爱的  我最喜欢唱歌了012---Oh, boy. I just love to sing.
是的  我知道你喜欢012---Yes, I know that you do.
其他人之所以抱怨012---but I think one of the reasons people were complaining...
他们付钱是来听男演员演唱“老人河”的012---...was because most of the people had paid to hear the actor sing "Old Man River."
哦  瞧瞧我们这对012---Oh, look at us.
谁又能想到  丘比特会光临14街的美甲店呢012---Who would've thought that Cupid had a station at 14th Street Nails?
好吧  我们得谈一谈012---Okay, we have to talk.
我刚结束一段很认真的恋情012---I'm just getting out of a very serious relationship.
我知道  而我刚结束一段婚姻012---I know. And I'm just getting out of a marriage.
这就叫做三生注定012---I mean, talk about meant to be.
没错  但我觉得进展的太快了012---Right. But I just think this is happening too soon.
什么  太快了  是太慢了012---Oh, too soon, too schmoon.
认命吧  这次我不会放过你的012---Face it honey, I am not letting you get away this time.
我听见了012---I hear you. Ha, ha.
但是  很不幸的  我公司012---But unfortunately, my company...
要把我调到海外012---...is transferring me overseas.
不会吧012---Oh, no.
调去哪里012---Where to?
巴黎  不  不是巴黎012---To Paris? No. No, not Paris.
伦敦  不  不  罗马  维也纳  巴塞罗那012---To London? Oh. No, Rome? Vienna? Ooh, ooh. Barcelona?
好了  你能不能停一会儿别说了012---Okay, could you just stop talking for a second?
也门012---Yemen.
对  没错  我要被调去也门012---That's right. Yes. I'm being transferred to Yemen.
什么时候  我现在还不太清楚012---When? I don't know exactly.
那我只好一直陪伴着钱德宾012---Well, I will just have to soak up every ounce of Chandler Bing...
直到出发的那一刻来临012---...until that moment comes.
但我知道是明天的什么时候012---But I do know it's sometime tomorrow.
好了么  对012---Done? Yep.
嘿   嘿012---Hey. Hey.
干什么012---What's up?
这个开关快把我逼疯了012---This switch thing has been driving me crazy.
所以我把它关掉  检查每个插座012---So I turned it off and checked every outlet.
有四个不能用  表示其中一个由它控制012---Now, four don't work, which means one of them has to be controlled by the switch.
所以我插上会发出声音的东西012---So I plugged in things in all four outlets that make noise.
也就是说  到时候一打开  顺着声音012---That way, when I turn it on, I just follow the noise...
去找就行了012---...and find out which one it is.
我一定会第一个放弃012---I bet I stopped listening before you did.
其实啊  你可以插电灯012---You know, you also could have used lamps...
然后顺着灯光的亮去找012---...and then followed the light.
是啊  可以呀  我要找声音  好吗012---Yeah, well, I'm using noise. Okay?
好吧  都准备好了吗012---All right, so everybody ready?
开始了012---Here we go.
有声音  我听到了  在哪里012---There's something. I hear something. Where is it?
是乔伊发出来的012---It's coming from Joey.
天哪  好诡异喔  把他关掉012---Oh, my God. That's so freaky. Turn him off.
在中央球场争球012---With the set scrum in center field.
嘿  嗨012---Oh, hey. Hi.
可以看新闻吗  可能在下雨012---Could we put on the news? I think it might be raining.
哦  等一下  我在看体育频道的橄榄球赛012---No, just hold on a sec. I'm watching this rugby thing on ESPN.
有什么大不了的   我也能打012---I don't know what the big deal is. I'm man enough to play this sport.
算了吧  你连看比赛的胆量都没有012---Dude, you're not even man enough to order the channel that carries the sport.
嗨   这不是罗斯么012---Hey there, Ross.
嘿012---Hey.
是珍妮丝012---Janice.
其实  你真的不必帮我收拾行李的012---You know, uh, you really didn't have to help me pack.
你说你出发之前都要打包012---Oh. When you said all you were gonna be doing...
除了帮你收拾行李012---...between now and the time you leave is packing...
我还有什么选择012---..you really didn't leave me much choice.Did you?
我以为会有很多东西  其实没多少012---Well, I thought I did, but I guess I did not.
嗨  怎么回事  收拾行李呀012---Hey. What's going on? Oh, I'm packing.
为明天去也门作准备012---You know, I'm packing because I'm moving to Yemen tomorrow.
谢谢你告诉我啊012---Thanks for telling me.
我是假装要搬去叶门  好摆脱她012---I'm only pretend-moving to Yemen, okay? It's the only way I can get rid of her.
喔  好主意012---Oh. Good one.
也门  听起来还真像个国家012---And Yemen. That actually sounds like a real country.
钱德  进来012---Hey, Chandler, come on.
我教你怎么把内衣裤塞进鞋子012---I'm gonna show you how to roll your underwear and stuff it in your shoes.
这样可以省空间  我那样做是想垫高点012---It's a real space-saver. I do that because it makes me look taller.
钱德  来啊012---Hey, Chandler. Come on.
好012---Okay.
乔伊  咱俩换换吧  不要012---Joey, trade lives with me. Nope.
天哪  瞧瞧这个  罗斯  你居然说你要打橄榄球012---Man, look at this. Ross, I can't believe you said you'd play.
这种运动好野蛮  我可以应付  行吗012---Look how brutal this is. Hey, I can handle it, all right?
算了吧  罗斯012---Oh, please, Ross.
你连跟我爸打羽毛球都会受伤012---You got hurt playing badminton with my dad.
那是因为你妈的狗一直  一直盯着我看012---That's because your mom's dog kept looking at me.
好吧  罗斯  看看  看这儿  这叫“并列争球”012---Okay, Ross, look, look, look. Right here, it's called a "scrum," okay?
一堆人挤作一团抢球  不就是个球么012---It's kind of like a huddle. And is a hum kind of like a scruddle?
罗斯  他们会宰了你012---Ross, they're gonna kill you.
你为什么非得玩这个012---Why are you doing this, anyway?
你们应该看看她以前交往的人012---Well, you should've seen the guy that she used to go out with.
他长的活像颗大橄榄球012---I mean, he's like Joe Rugby.
不会吧  那他也玩橄榄球么  太搞笑了012---You're kidding. And he plays rugby? That's so funny.
我懂你的意思了012---Oh, I see. You did that. All right.
总之  她觉得我打橄榄球很好笑  是瞎胡闹012---Anyway, she thought the very idea of me playing rugby with him was, like, hilarious.
我就是要证明我有多勇猛012---So I'm gonna show her how tough I really am.
对不起  你说得对  你是很猛012---I'm sorry, I'm sorry. You're right. You are a tough guy.
你是我认识最猛的古生物学家012---You're the toughest paleontologist I know.
好啦  别开玩笑了012---All right, come on.
罗斯会照顾好自己的  他又不是钱德012---Look, Ross can take care of himself. It's not like he's Chandler.
多谢夸奖012---Thanks.
好了  别替我担心012---Look, don't worry about me.
我会装得很有冲劲  离球越远越好012---I'll just look real energetic and stay away from the ball.
也会学那个人站在圈外012---I'll be that guy, right outside the circle.
哦  哦012---Ooh. Oh!
天啊012---Oh, jeez.
也许旁边正好有只狗在盯着他012---Oh. Well, maybe there was a dog looking at him.
罗斯  罗斯  罗斯012---Okay, Ross, Ross, Ross.
别靠近那个人  那个人和那个人012---You're gonna wanna stay away from that guy and that guy and that one.
天哪  他们都太壮了012---Dude, they're all huge.
又没比我壮多少012---They don't look any bigger than me.
你离你比较近012---That's because you're closer to you.
所以看你自己比较壮012---So you look bigger to you from where you are.
我去跟他们打个招呼012---I'm just gonna go and say hello to the lads.
好  好012---All right. Okay.
嗨012---Hi.
喔012---Oh.
还蛮可爱的012---I kind of liked it.
我知道了  我要变成"红脸罗斯"012---Okay, I know what I've gotta do. I've gotta go Red Ross.
不记得 "红脸罗斯"啊012---You know, Red Ross?
完全不明白你在讲什么012---Totally don't know what you're talking about.
那次我们去看《与狼共舞》012---That time that we were all waiting in line for Dances With Wolves...
有人插队  我不是就生气了012---...and that one guy cut in front of us, and I just lost it?
破口大骂  脸都涨红了012---Huh? Screamed at him, turned all red.
红脸罗斯012---Red Ross!
不记得了012---No.
等着瞧012---You'll see.
连恩   帮个忙012---Liam, do me a favor.
对罗斯手下留情  他是第一次玩这个012---Tell the lads to go easy on Ross. It's his first time.
完全看不出来呀012---You don't say?
谢了  好012---Thanks. Okay.
祝你好运  亲爱的012---Good luck, babe.
罗斯  罗斯  快来  到这儿来012---Ross. Ross, come on, get in here.
来啊  罗斯012---Ross, come on.
罗斯012---Ross.
罗斯  快进来争球012---Ross, come on, get in the bloody scrum.
罗斯  进去012---Ross, get in.
乔伊012---Joey!
说了你一定不信   约书亚今天来  你猜怎样012---Oh. You are not gonna believe it. Joshua came in today, and guess what happened?
他约你出去  没有012---He asked you out? No.
不过我给他看了一些扣链样本  顺便摸到了他的脉搏012---But I was showing him some cuff links, and I felt his pulse.
聪明012---Saucy.
这是什么  这栋楼的电路图012---What are these? Oh. Electrical plans for the building.
好吧  好吧  我应该要害怕吗012---Okay, okay, okay, should I be scared?
我知道那个开关肯定有用  我到城管处去拿了这个012---I know that switch has gotta do something. So I went to City Hall and I got these.
只花了25美元  排了3小时012---All I had to do was pay $25 and wait in line for three hours.
哇  还好知道的人不多012---Wow. If only more people knew.
其实  你真的没必要送我到机场012---You know, you really didn't have to take me to the airport.
喔  别这样  每分每秒都很珍贵012---Oh, please. Every moment is precious.
况且  总得有人在另一辆出租车上帮你看行李吧012---Besides, somebody had to ride in that other taxi with your luggage.
还有  你的朋友好像根本不在乎你要离开似的012---And your friends don't seem to care very much that you're leaving.
我们其实没那么要好012---Well, we're not really that close.
好的  我们  就此告别吧  再见了012---Okay. So I guess this is, uh, you know, goodbye, then.
不  不012---Oh, no, no.
还没到呢  我会一直陪到你上飞机为止012---It's not goodbye. I'm not leaving until you get on that plane.
好  那就请你 "在此等候"012---Okay, well, I guess it's just "wait here," then.
我要一张去也门的假机票012---Hi. I need a fake ticket to Yemen.
一张去叶门的机票  不  不  不012---One ticket to Yemen? Oh, no, no, no.
我只需要一张假机票012---I just need a pretend ticket.
抱歉  先生  我不懂您的意思012---I'm sorry, sir, I don't understand.
好吧  假如一个小孩要拿票玩  你会给他什么样的票012---What would you give to a kid if he wanted a ticket to play with?
您还有带小孩么012---Are you traveling with a child?
没有012---No.
好吧  她以为我会给你一张信用卡012---Oh. y'know what, She's gonna think that I'm handing you a credit card.
其实我拿的是借书证012---But what I'm really gonna do is hand you a library card.
先生  去叶门的机票是2100美元  我们不收借书证012---Uh, sir, a ticket to Yemen is $2100, and we don't take library cards.
怎么了  有什么问题吗012---What's the matter? Is something wrong?
你得留下来吗012---Do you have to stay?
美国运通卡012---American Express?
罗斯012---Ross!
啊  哦012---Oh. Ah.
他们怎么这样  我明明叫他们手下留情的012---I can't believe they're doing that to him. I told them to go easy on him.
你不要介意  不过  你有时候说话口音太重012---No offense, but sometimes it's hard to understand you...
让人很难听懂012---...you know, with the accent, so...
才上半场结束  还有的他受呢012---That's just halftime. There's more of this. Oh.
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
嘿012---Hey.
你们看到了吗  我挺强的吧  好过瘾的球赛012---Did you see me? I was pretty good, huh? That is one fun game.
没错  帮个忙  去帮我拿水012---Right. Do me a favor? Grab me a bottle of water?
好  谢了012---Yeah. Thanks.
我觉得我快死了  真的  真可怜012---I think I'm dying. I really do. Oh, poor baby.
告诉我儿子我爱他012---Tell my son that I love him.
太好了  我还要玩得更爽一些012---Oh, excellent. Okay, gotta have some more fun.
罗斯  你快被整死了012---Ross, they are killing you out there.
不会的  她说得对  你不能再打了012---That's not true. She's right. You have to stop.
什么 不  不  不行  我是红脸罗斯012---What? No. No, I'm not stopping. I'm Red Ross.
算了吧  你再上场会变成屎面罗斯012---Dude, you go back out there, you're gonna be Dead Ross.
那我不管  我绝不退场  我要打完全场012---I don't care. I am not quitting. I am gonna finish this game.
好  如果你一定要坚持打  至少得让我帮帮你012---All right. If you insist on doing this, at least let me help you.
天啊  不  这不是女人玩的  那些人什么都抢012---God, no. That is no place for a woman. Those guys will grab anything.
我不是要上场012---That's not what I was saying.
我只是知道怎样让别人受伤012---I just might know a few things that could help you inflict some pain.
我喜欢  真的吗  听清楚了012---I like that. Yeah? Listen closely.
听好  戴文的脚踝很弱012---Devon has got a weak ankle. Huh?
你轻轻一踢  他就不敢上前了012---One swift kick and he'll back off.
好  踢脚踝  记下了012---All right, bad ankle. Got it.
那个留落腮胡的大个子012---And that big bloke with the beard? Uh-huh.
屁股受过伤012---He's got a trick hip. Ha, ha.
还有  那边的大卫  我听说他没戴护膝012---Yeah. And David over there, I heard that he doesn't wear a cup.
真的吗  我清楚了  一个屁股受过伤  一个没有护膝  好012---Real...? I could use that. Trick hip, no cup. Okay, okay.
还有  连恩的膝盖有伤012---And Liam. Liam's got bad knees.
你看准了一踢上去  一撞就倒012---You hit him right and he'll go down like a lamp.
但是连恩跟我同队012---But Liam's on my team.
我不管   你只管对付他们   好  对付他们012---I don't care. You just get him. Go get him.
好  我要回场上了012---Okay. I am going back in.
赤面罗斯012---Red Ross. Yeah.
嗨  嗨012---Hi. Hi.
这些是什么012---What are these?
我画了一些画挂起来012---Oh, just some pictures I made and hung up.
好让客厅看起来更漂亮  不是么  你不觉得吗012---I thought they'd brighten up the place. They do, don't you think?
