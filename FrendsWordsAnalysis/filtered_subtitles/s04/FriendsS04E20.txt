只要我一打呼噜  他就把我翻过来012---And whenever I'd snore, he'd roll me over...
啊哦  喔012---Oh, yeah.
他把我翻过来  我就不打呼噜了012---He'd roll me over, and I'd stop snoring.
下次你再打  我就把你翻过去012---Next time you snore, I'm rolling you over!

因为事情来得太快了  不是因为你是个失败者012---Just 'cause its happening so fast; not 'cause you're such a loser.

困死了012---I'm so tired.
现在才六点012---It's 6:00.
嗨  嘿012---Hi. Hey.
听说你和约书亚   要跟罗斯艾蜜莉一起出去吃饭012---I hear you and Joshua are going out with Ross and Emily.
我觉得  这么做很有风度012---And I think... I think that's really cool.
是啊  你处理得相当好啊012---Yeah, I think you're handling that really well.
"处理"012---"Handling it"
什么意思  没什么好处理的012---What do you mean? There's nothing to handle.
如果不是和约书亚在交往  也许我接受不了这事012---Maybe I would have a problem with this if it wasn't for me and Joshua.
不过反正他们也结不了婚  什么012---Y'know, They're not gonna get married anyway. What?
拜托  他们这么草率  简直太可笑了012---Come on. They rushed into this thing so fast, it's ridiculous!
他们应该先订婚   一年012---They'll be engaged for like what? A year?
这期间  他们俩总会有人想通012---And somewhere along the way, one of them is gonna realize what they've done...
然后再取消婚约012---...and call the thing off.
你们会先在我的婚礼上跳舞012---I'm telling you, you'll be dancing at my wedding before you dance at theirs.
我参加婚礼从不跳舞012---You know, I don't dance at weddings.
为什么   婚礼是认识女生的好地方012---Why not? Because weddings are a great place to meet women.
而我要跳舞   就像这副德性012---When I dance, I look like this.
你好  嘿012---Hey, man. Hey.
四周后的今天你们有事吗012---So, what are you guys doing four weeks from today?
没事  没事012---Nothing. Nothing.
我…012---I am...
有空012---...free.
太好了  因为艾蜜莉和我一个月后要结婚012---Great, Because Emily and I are getting married in a month!
什么  没错012---What? Yup.
一个月后   对012---In a month? Yeah.
你是说30天后  对012---You mean 30 days? Yeah.
从今天算起  对012---From now? Yeah.
太棒了  对012---That's great! Yeah, ha, ha.
艾蜜莉一直想在她父母结婚的  同一个漂亮地方举行婚礼012---Emily always wanted to get married in this beautiful place that her parents got married ...
但那里马上要拆除了  所以012---...but it's gonna be torn down, so...
我知道这很疯狂  但所有事从头到尾都很疯狂012---I know it's crazy, but everything up 'til now has been so crazy,...
我不知道  就是感觉该这样012---...and I don't know, just feels right, you know?
那是我经期的第二天012---Hey, that's the day after I start menstruating!
这不是我的012---This isn't mine.
嘿  瑞秋012---Ahem Hey, Rachel.

坐012---Sit.
你还好吗012---You okay?
好得不得了  我非常  非常地高兴012---I'm more than okay. I am really, really happy.
想知道为什么吗012---Want to know why?
我想吗012---Do I?
因为我真为我们俩高兴012---Because I am really happy about us.
我认为我们发展得很好012---I think we are, I think we are so on the right track.
我意思是  我们相处的好  我们也很合拍012---Y'know? I mean, I think we are working. I think we are clicking.
你懂吗  当然012---You know? Yeah, sure, sure.
我们  我们很合拍012---We're... We're clicking. Yeah.
如果说有什么小缺憾012---If there was just one little area...
需要加强的  我觉得012---...where I think we need to work on, I would think...
应该就是我们还不够疯狂012---...it's that we're just not crazy enough.
老实说  我不太同意这点012---I got to say, I'm not too sure I agree with that.
好吧  你知道吗  你对的012---Well, yeah. You know, yeah, you're right.
当然  我们也很开心012---I mean, we have our fun. Yeah?
但是012---But, uh...
我是说像疯--狂一样  你懂吗012---We ju... I mean like craaaazy! You know?
好吧  这个012---Okay. All right.
这个听起来  是有点点仓促012---This is gonna, this is gonna to sound, you know, a little, um, hasty.
但你先听听看012---But, uh, just go with me.
我们结婚怎么样012---What if we got married?
什么  我知道  你会觉得012---What? Oh, I know. It's so totally like:
"哇  我们行吗"  我是说012---"Whoa, can we do this?" You know? I mean...
就是感觉该这样  你不觉得  该这样吗012---But it just feels right. Don't you think? It does.
就是感觉应该这样   你说呢012---I mean, it just feels right. Don't you...?
瑞秋012---Rachel, um...
你是个012---you're
很特别012---a real
的女性012---special lady.
但是我的离婚还没办完012---But my divorce isn't final yet
而且  我们才约会了四次012---and, and, and we've been on four dates.
所以我是想说  不要012---So I'm thinking  no...
不过012---but
谢了012---thanks.
你这个白痴012---You idiot!

你来看什么012---So, uh, what are you in for?
我说梦话012---I talk in my sleep.
真巧啊  我专爱听梦话012---What a coincidence. I listen in my sleep.
给个你的电话好吗012---So why don't you give me your number?

你扔的也太没水准了012---That was a terrible throw!
我才不直接扔给你  太假了012---I won't throw it right to you. That's not real.
你看我  还担心太假吗012---Look at me. My big concern is what's real?
天哪012---Oh, my God.
我们真的很悲哀  对吧012---We're really sad, aren't we?
是啊  没错012---Yeah, I think we are.
这还不是我的婚纱012---This isn't even my dress.
至少不是去 "还不算太晚婚纱店" 租的012---At least you didn't rent yours from a store called "It's Not Too Late."
我要去换掉  我也是012---I'm changing out of this. Me too.
要不  再过半小时后  我也是012---In, like, a half an hour? Me too.
这次直接扔给我  好吧012---All right, now throw it straight this time. Okay.
我下一个结婚了012---I'm getting married next! Yay!
我现在好讨厌一般普通的衣服012---I hate my regular clothes now.
低头一看就知道012---You know? I look down and I know...
今天不是我人生最特别的日子012---...this isn't gonna be the most special day of my life.
是啊  我意思是刚开始还挺好玩012---Yeah. I mean, it was kind of fun for a while...
你不觉得有点傻吗012---...but didn't you feel kind of silly?
是有点012---I guess.
哦  天哪012---Oh, my God!
啊  你这个骗子012---Oh, you're such a cheater!
哈罗  小可爱们012---Hello, little ones.
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
乔伊不再打呼了吗  会的012---So is Joey going to stop snoring? Yep!
而且有个美女答应跟我约会012---And a beautiful woman agreed to go out with me.
乔伊本来也想约她  但她选了我012---Joey wanted to ask her out, but, uh, you know, she picked me.
怎么可能呢012---How'd that happen?
因为我更酷012---Because I'm cooler.
不  说真的012---No, seriously.
她是那种  让乔伊意识不清的女孩012---She's the kind of girl... Joey was unconscious.
嗨  伙计们  你们好吗012---Hey, you guys! What's happening?
天哪012---Oh, my God.
那是什么  这是睡眠诊所给的012---What is that? Oh! They gave it to me at the sleep clinic.
帮助我不打呼012---And it's going to help me not to snore.
那你现在在睡觉吗012---Well, are you asleep right now, Joe?
没睡觉应该不用咬着它吧012---'Cause I don't think you have to wear it unless you are!
我当然知道012---I know I don't have to.
味道不错012---It tastes good.
还有  你看起来很酷012---Plus, you look cool.
我刚给约书亚打电话012---Well, I just called Joshua.
怎么样012---Oh, how'd it go?
我尽力说服他我不是012---I did my best to convince him that I'm not...
想结婚想的发疯的女孩012---...some crazy girl who is dying to get married.
我只是处在情绪低落的非常时期  他怎么说012---And I'm going through a hard time. What'd he say?
他的录音电话表示很理解012---Well, uh, his answering machine was very understanding.
我好郁闷012---I feel blue. Ugh.
啊  甜心012---Aw. Sweety.
我打赌他一定会给你电话012---I bet you anything he'll call you again.
可能吧  但我想  我都不在乎这个了012---Yeah, maybe. But, you know, I don't think I even care.
我想他不是我为之伤心的那个012---I don't think he's the one I'm sad about.
我知道我说过  我完全不在意罗斯结婚012---I know I said I'm totally okay with Ross getting married.
但是实际上012---But as it turns out...
我还接受不了012---...I don't think I'm handling it all that well.
是啊  有可能012---Yeah, maybe.
我正在努力寻找原因012---And I'm just trying to figure out why.
找到了012---Any luck?
是啊  罗斯和我总是012---Well, yeah. You know how Ross and I have always been...
和了分  分了和  然后又分012---...on-again, off-again, on-again, off-again?
我一直觉得总会在什么时候012---I guess I just figured, somewhere down the road...
我们又会和好012---...we would be on-again.
又会的012---Again.
知道吗  我们都这么觉得012---You know what? I think we all did.
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.

约书亚不会去了012---Joshua's not going to be there.
怎么了  我想他是要跟我分手了012---What happened? Um, well, I think he broke up with me.
天哪  为什么012---No. Why?
很明显  他经不起惊吓012---Apparently, he scares easy.
瑞秋  我很难过012---Rachel, I'm sorry.
没关系012---Eh, it's okay.
有时候  人生往往会事与愿违012---Sometimes things don't work out the way you thought they would.
过来012---Come here.
你不用去接艾蜜莉吗012---Oh, hey, don't you have to go pick up Emily?
