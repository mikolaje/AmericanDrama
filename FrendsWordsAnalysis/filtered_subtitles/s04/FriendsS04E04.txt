瑞秋  你把吃剩的空盒子又放回冰箱012---Rachel, you just put an empty carton back in the fridge.
对啊  因为垃圾袋满了012---I know, but the garbage was full.

搞得一团糟  反正最后穿工装的大个子会来清扫012---make a mess and the big man in coveralls will come in here and clean it up, huh?
为什么不替他人多想想  改一改呢012---Well, why don't think of someone else for a change?

老天  干这么点活你也会哭012---God, if you're going to cry about it!
012---Friends S04E04  The one with the ballroom dancing
是崔戈把你弄哭的012---Whoa, whoa! Treeger made you cry?

我要下去给那家伙上一课  教训他一下012---I'm gonna go down there and teach that guy a lesson.
乔伊  别去  我们最好忘掉这事012---Joey, please don't do that. I think it's best that we just forget about it.
你说的倒轻松  刚才被折磨的又不是你012---That's easy for you to say. You weren't almost just killed!
好的  上课的时间到了012---All right, that's it. School is in session!

你以为他们每月从我帐户上扣掉50块  我很开心吗012---You think I like having 50 dollars taken out of my bank account every month?
不  他们让你到他们那里012---No, they make you go all the way down there!
然后就运用所有的词语和表情来迷惑你012---Then they use all of these phrases and peppiness to try and confuse you!
最后他们推出了玛利亚012---And then they bring out Maria.
玛利亚是谁  哦  玛利亚012---Who is Maria? Oh, Maria!
你没有能力拒绝她012---You can't say no to her.
她就像是用合成弹力纤维包装的健身房的...礼品012---she's like this lycra spandex covered gym…treat.
要我和你一道去帮你打气吗012---Do you need me to go with you and hold your hand?
不用了  那你有勇气单独面对她吗012---No!  So you're strong enough to face her on your own?
不  你还是来吧012---Oh no, you'll have to come.
崔比亚尼  等一下012---Tribbiani. Hold on.
我去拿皮揣子 (通马桶用)012---I'll get the plunger.

跟他说什么012---And tell him what?
你难道不知道什么叫 "不准让女孩哭泣"吗012---Have you heard about a little something called "not making girls cry."
你也许听过1968年发布的《租屋安定法案》吧012---Yeah. Well maybe you have heard about the Rent Stabilization Act of 1968!
说实话  我还真的没听过012---I have actually not heard of that.
你朋友触犯了这个法案012---Yeah, well your friends are in violation of it.
我一直没出声  不过现在我不用再做好人了012---I've been a nice guy up until now, but, I don't need this grief.
我要去告诉房东012---I'm gonna call the landlord...
把莫妮卡外婆的房子转租给她  是非法的012---and tell him that Monica is illegally subletting here grandmother's apartment.
你的朋友们要被赶出去了  伙计012---Your friends are out of here, pal.
你为什么不告诉我些  我不知道的东西012---Why don't you tell me something I don't know!
拜托  今天我真不想去上班012---Oh please, somebody tell me I don't have to go to work today!
怎么了012---What's the matter?
今天第一个客人是个帅得一塌糊涂的家伙012---My first massage today is this incredibly gorgeous guy.
一看到他  我就想...012---and every time I see him I just want to...
替他免费服务一下012---do things to him that I'm not allowed to charge for.
那就免费吧012---So do them for free.
不行  公司不准012---No, it is forbidden.
跟客人乱来  会被波特太太开除012---No-no, Mrs. Potter fires people for fooling around with clients.
而且也违反女按摩师的誓言012---And it's against my oath as a masseuse.
你们要宣誓的吗  不  我自己的誓言012---They make you take an oath? No, I made myself take an oath.
不得与客人乱来...012---Yeah, no fooling around with clients...
时刻准备着012---and always be prepared.
后一句是童子军说的  不过说得通012---Yeah, that one's actually from the Boy Scouts, but it just makes good sense.
你为什么不把他转给别人012---Why don't you just give him to somebody else?
不用  我能处理  我是职业的012---No, I can handle it. No, I'm a professional.
菲比  那是个新脚镯吗012---Oh Pheebs, is that a new ankle bracelet?
你还做了脚部美容  还盛装打扮012---And you got a petticure. Your feet are all dressed up.
因为当他在按摩台上  那是你唯一能被他看见的部分012---Because that's the only part of you he can see when he's on the table!
你想用脚来勾引他012---You're gonna do some feet flirting!
我不懂你们在说什么012---I don't know what you're talking about.
那脚趾环你又怎么解释012---Then how do you explain the toe ring?!
因为今天是阿拉伯公主日  行了吧  别烦我012---Because it's Arabian princess day at work! Okay?! Leave me alone!
英雄  事情怎样了012---My hero! What happened?
我下去告诉他  说谁也不能那样对我朋友012---Well, I went down there and told him that no one treats my friends like that.
最好能上来道个歉  待会儿见012---and that he'd better come up here and apologize. I'll see you later.
等等012---Wait a minute.
那他怎么说012---What did he say?
他说他不会来道歉  因为你们住在这里是违法的012---He said that he wasn't gonna apologize because you guys are living here illegally.
相反他要把你们赶出去  待会儿见012---so instead what he's gonna do is have you evicted-I'll see you later.
什么  你搞到我们要被赶出去  告诉过你不要去012---What?! You got us evicted! I told you not to go down there!
他把瑞秋气哭了012---He made Rachel cry!
瑞秋经常哭的012---Rachel always cries!
这不是真的吧012---That's not true!
现在你得去拍他的马屁012---You go down there and you suck up to him
而且要拍得不留痕迹012---I mean you suck like you've never sucked before!
好吧  我试试看012---All right, I'll try.
不过失败的话  你们可以和钱德还有我暂时一起住着012---But if I can't, you can stay with Chandler and I until you get settled.
快去   好...012---Go! All right, all right.
我会先和他商量商量  不过我想他可能会很酷012---I mean I'll have to check with him first, but I'll think he'll be cool with it.
记着我们刚才说过的  你要强硬一点012---Now remember what we talked about, you gotta be strong.
是的  是的012---Yes! Yes!
再试一次012---One more time.

怎样012---What?
拜托不要把莫妮卡和瑞秋赶出去  不是她们的错  错在我012---Please don't kick Monica and Rachel out, this wasn't there fault, it was mine.
你是要我把你们赶出去012---You want me to kick you guys out instead?
你不能这么做  那样小鸡小鸭该住哪儿012---No you can't do that, where would the chick and the duck live?
你们养宠物  没  没有012---You have pets? No! no!
那些只是外号012---Those are nicknames.

有个公寓主管的舞会  主管(超级)舞会012---Yeah, there's this superintendent's dance "The Super Ball."
他想引起玛芝的注意  就是他爱上的那个女主管012---and he wants to impress Marge, this lady super that he's a crush on.
为什么不找个女生来练习012---Well, why doesn't he practice with a girl?
他太怕羞012---Well, he's too shy
以他现在的技术  还不能和女生跳舞012---He doesn't thing he's good enough to dance with girls yet.
那倒没错012---Yeah, right.
他差点让我跳进那个垃圾道012---He almost danced me right down that garbage chute.

或者  我们可以去银行012---Or we could go to the bank...
销掉帐户  切断他们的来源012---close our accounts and cut them off at the source.
你真是天才012---You're a genius.

又多了一条理由012---Now there's two reasons.
你们还记得我上次提到的那个帅哥顾客吗012---You guys, remember that cute client I told you about?
我咬了他012---I bit him.
哪里  屁股012---Where? On the tushy.
这不违背你的誓言吗012---And that's not against your oath?
我知道  我很抱歉  可是当我一摸他012---No, I know! I'm sorry, but the moment I touch him

好的012---Okay, well...
跟着我的舞步012---just follow my lead.
不需要先做点准备吗012---Don't we need to do some kind of preparation first?
比如  喝个烂醉012---Like get really drunk?
来  用手环抱着我012---Come on. Hey, just put your arms around me.
真对不起012---I'm sorry.
不要紧  不过要是玛芝012---No. It's okay. But if I'm Marge...
我的胸要从背部出来了012---my breasts are coming out my back.
算了  我永远也跳不好012---Forget it! I'm not being any good at this.
我妈说的对012---My mom was right.
我只是个有头  有手  有脚的大土豆012---I'm just a big potato with arms and legs and a head.
老兄  你并不是什么土豆012---Come on, man. You're not a potato.

你只要多练练012---You just need more practice.
来  我们再试一次012---Here, Come on. Let's try it again.
刚才可能要怪我012---Plus, it was probably mostly my fault anyway.
你知道  我不是个让人感觉很舒服的舞伴...012---I mean, you know, I'm not really that comfortable dancing with a...
舞练得怎样  像在"搞同性恋"吗012---So how goes the dancing? Gay yet?
你们这次要多谢我012---You guys owe me bigtime.
什么012---What was that?
你刚才在跳舞012---You just did a little dancy thing.

尽管你让我有...这种感觉012---even though you give me you know, the feeling.
我根本不知道012---I had no idea.
不过  我可以找别人帮我按摩012---But you know, I could always find another masseuse.

开那个干什么012---What are you ever gonna use that for?!
转帐给健身中心012---To pay for the gym.
我今天过的真不错012---So I had a great day.
里克和我一拍即合  我们正想更进一步012---Rick and I really hit it off, and we started making out,
老板就走了进来  以为我是个妓女  开除了我012---and then my boss walked in and fired me for being a whore.
你被开除了  我的天012---You got fired? Oh, my gosh!
真不敢相信  我以前从没因为任何原因被开除过012---It's so weird, I have never been fired from anything before!

我觉得转圈还不够好012---Yeah, but you know, I think the reason we're not getting that spin right is
因为我那里太小了012---because my apartment's too small.
那你想用我们的房子吗  不  我另有办法012---Look, you wanna use our place? No, I had another idea.
成功了012---We did it!
