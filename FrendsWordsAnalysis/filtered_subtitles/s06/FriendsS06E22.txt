我回来了  嘿012---Hi, you guys. Hey.
怎么了012---What's the matter?
又是那种很讨厌的状况012---Well, it's just... It's one of these situations that I just hate.
有一个客人送我三张票012---You know, a massage client gave me three tickets...
是去摩根大通博物馆看展览的012---...to the Helmut Peltz Exhibit at the Morgan Chase Museum.
所以  你觉得你得陪他睡觉012---Now you're thinking you gotta sleep with him.
不  不是  他只给了三张票  但是我们有六个人012---No. No, it's just that he gave me three tickets and there are six of us.
我弃权  我也是012---I'll give up my ticket. Me too.
你们真大方012---Okay. That's so generous.
罗斯也应该很大方的012---And I think Ross is generous too.
太好了  就我们女生去012---Great. Okay. Then it's just us girls.
很棒  对012---Great. Yeah.
那个  是什么展览012---So, what is the exhibit?
主要是图片展012---It's mostly just photographs...
女同的性爱摄影展  视频游戏  送免费三明治012---...of, um, lesbian love scenes interspersed with video games and free sandwiches.
都是你012---Oh, man.
大家好  嘿012---Hi. Hi. Hi there.
嘿  罗斯  听着012---Hey, Ross, listen.
钱德刚把你周末去女同三明治博物馆的机会给让出去了012---Chandler got you out of going to the lesbian sandwich museum this weekend.
谢谢   我另有安排了  伊丽莎白和我要出城去012---Thanks? But I have plans. Uh, Elizabeth and I are going out of town.
太好了  对啊012---Oh, that's great. Yeah.
你要发财了012---Think about all the money that you're gonna make.
什么意思012---Why? What?
是她爸付钱请你当保姆  对吧012---Well, her father pays you for babysitting, right?
哇哦012---Uh-oh. Ha, ha.
不  真好笑   是不是该放我们一马了012---No, no. That's funny. But maybe it's time to move on.
够了  别再闹了  不许再提012---You know, let it go. Stop it.
再说了   瑞秋不是也在和她爸交往嘛012---Besides, Rachel's going out with Elizabeth's father.
而且他比瑞秋老太多了012---So, uh, he's much older than she is.
看来不只是我对化石有兴趣啊012---Looks like I'm not the only one interested in fossils. Huh?
罗斯  这种话只会提醒我们  你的确对化石有兴趣012---I means, all that does is remind us that you are interested in fossils.
好吧  好吧012---Okay, okay.
嗯  以后瑞秋想和他甜言蜜语   要大吼大叫了012---Uh, well, Rachel's gonna to need to yell sweet nothings in his ear. Huh?
罗斯  拜托  难道你们不觉得好笑012---Ross? Oh, come on, that's funny, you know?
他需要戴助听器了012---he's need— he's got, like, a hearing aide, you know?
因为他太老了012---‘cause-‘cause y'know, ‘cause he's all old.
失陪一下012---One second.
听着  罗斯012---Okay, look, Ross.
因为丽莎很喜欢你012---Just so you know, since Lizzie likes you so much...
所以我决定接受你们交往的事实012---...I accept the fact that you're going out with her.
真的  那太好了012---Really? Okay, that's great.
是啊  但现在我改主意了012---Yeah. But then I changed my mind.
我就是这么善变012---I'm funny like that.
我已经警告了丽莎   现在我警告你012---So I've told Lizzie and now I'm telling you.
不许再跟我女儿见面了012---I don't want you seeing my daughter anymore.
好吧   我知道你很不满意012---All right, look. I realize it upsets you.
没错  很不满意012---Yes, it does.
但丽莎和我都是成年人了012---But Elizabeth and I are both adults...
所以我想  你也无可奈何012---...and so I don't think there's really anything you can do about it.
我会告诉校方   让师生恋曝光   你就会被开除012---I'll tell the university about your relationship and have you fired.
有备而来啊012---Oh, a man with a plan.
老友记  第六季  第22集  大逆转012---Friends  S06E22  The One Where Paul's The Man
太帅了   你的照片又重返名人墙了012---This is so exciting. You get your picture back up on the wall of fame.
是啊  之前贴在墙上好酷啊012---I know. It was so cool when it was up there before.
我经常和吉姆贝路西有说有笑012---Me and Jim Belushi would just be cracking up about something.
后来我被《我们的日子》开除   照片就被拿下来012---Then I get fired off Days of Our Lives and he takes me down.
到现在他都在嘲笑我012---Now he's just laughing at me.
你看那个  自呜得意的混蛋012---Look at him. That smug Belushi bastard.
也许他们可以   把你挂在012---Oh. Okay. Maybe when they put your picture back up...
麦特劳尔旁边012---...they could put you next to Matt Lauer.
你看他在冲我微笑012---Look at him just smiling at me. Hee-hee.
我知道   我们俩一定合拍012---Yeah, I know. We'd be great together.
我回来了  你是谁012---Hey. So I'm back. Who are you?
乔伊崔比亚尼012---Joey Tribbiani.
之前上过名人墙的012---From the wall?
也许这样   你会想起来012---Okay, maybe this will jog your memory, huh?
嗯012---Huh?
总之012---Okay, anyway.
我可以返回墙上了  我主演了一出新戏012---I'm ready to go back up on the wall. I'm the star of a new TV show.
翻给我看   还没演呢012---Show me in the TV book. Oh, well, it's not on TV yet.
那你就不能上墙了012---Well, then it's not on the wall yet.
这样吧   我拿录影带给你看  可以吧012---Okay, fine. I will bring you a tape. Huh?
你手边有麦特劳尔的衣服吗012---So, um, now, do you have any of Matt Lauer's clothes here?
或许还有没洗过的012---Maybe just ones that haven't been cleaned yet?
天啊012---God.
哦  我好喜欢到博物馆012---Oh, I love museums.
来接受文化薰陶012---Soaking up all the culture. Yeah.
你想先去哪里   去礼品部012---Where do you want to start? Ooh, the gift shop.
好啊012---Yeah.
然后去用餐   等等  我不能吃太多012---Hey, and then lunch. Oh, wait, yes, but I can't eat too much.
保罗今晚要带我去吃饭   他说会有个大惊喜012---Paul's taking me out to dinner tonight. He said he has a big surprise planned.
他会不会告诉你说  他是个同性恋012---Ow, wow. What do you think? Maybe he's gonna tell you he's gay?
什么啊  不可能  你为什么这么说012---What? No, why?
不为什么   这样才真是个大惊喜啊012---No reason. That would just be a really big surprise, right?
红毯可以铺在这边   然后在这边举办婚礼仪式012---You could put the aisle over here and then have the wedding ceremony here.
原来这里可以办婚礼012---I didn't know you could get married here.
作为婚礼场所   这里太美了012---This would be a beautiful place to get married.
但我不会把红毯铺在那边   更不会在那边举办婚礼仪式012---Yeah, but I wouldn't put the aisle there. And I'd never have the ceremony there.
应该在这个漂亮的拱门下宣誓012---You'd have the ceremony under this big, beautiful arch.
有什么事吗012---May I help you?
抱歉打断你   这地方太美了012---Oh, sorry. Didn't mean to interrupt. It's just such a beautiful space.
常办婚礼吗  是的  这里很受欢迎012---Do you do a lot of weddings here? Yes, we're very popular.
预约都已经排到两年后了   抱歉012---There's a two-year waiting list. Sorry.
摩妮卡  你也应该去报名预约012---Monica, you should totally put your name down for this place.
什么   你疯了吗012---What? Are you crazy?
我又不结婚   甚至还没订婚012---I'm not getting married. I'm not even engaged.
对啊   反正要等两年嘛   要是你两年内订了婚才报名012---Yeah, but there's a two-year wait. What if you get engaged in two years?
不是还得再等两年才能在这里办嘛012---Then you've gotta wait another two years for this place?
加起来就四年了   钱德才不会等那么久012---That's four years. Chandler's not gonna wait that long.
他会去找别人了012---He's gonna find somebody else, you know?
找某个预约报了名的女人012---Someone, someone who did put their name on the list. Mm-hm.
亲爱的  先预约又不会怎样012---Yeah. Honey, it can't hurt to put your name down.
要是两年内没订婚   就放弃不用了012---If in two years you're not engaged, you just don't use it.
有道理   先预约的确不会怎样012---Well, I guess there is no harm in putting my name down.
我也要预约   我也要012---I'm gonna do it too. Me too.
真的  你要嫁给谁012---Really? Who would you marry?
不知道   我现在还没有对象012---I don't know. I don't have anyone right now, you know?
噢  菲比012---Oh, Pheebs.
别为我难过  至少我的男朋友不是同性恋012---Don't feel too sorry for me. At least my boyfriend isn't gay.
菲比  这种事  别招惹我批评你家那个啊012---Phoebe, that's not... Don't even get me started on yours.
嘿012---Hey.
看过我拿来的带子了吗   看过了012---So, did you watch the tape of my show? I did.
怎样  我能上墙了吗  不行  你不能上墙 012---All right. Let's get me back up there. No. You don't go up on the wall.
什么  但你是看了我的片子  对  你那片子冒犯了我们012---What? But you saw the show. Yes. It was very offensive to my people.
冒犯了干洗店一族012---Dry cleaners?
冒犯了俄国人   把他们都当成恐怖分子和恶棍012---Russians. It showed them as terrorists and villains.
好  你看  你墙上还有哈里逊福特012---Okay, okay. Look, you got Harrison Ford up there.
没错   福特先生是个好顾客012---That's right. Mr. Ford is a very good customer.
他能带很多衣服来洗  而你却两手空空012---He brings us a lot of clothes. You bring us nothing.
说得也许对012---Okay, well, that may be true.
但《空军一号》里   俄国人是恐怖分子  很邪恶012---But, in-in .Air Force One. okay, the Russians  were terrorists and evil.
他还杀了一堆俄国人  那才是冒犯俄国人呢012---And plus, he kills a bunch of them. That's offensive to Russians.
我没看过  你应该要看  很赞012---I've never seen it. Oh, you should. It's great.
这里真的好漂亮012---This place is really beautiful.
对啊  我从小就常来  这里以前是我奶奶家012---Yeah. I've been coming here since I was a kid. This used to be my grandma's.
可我只遗传了我奶奶的眼睛012---Wow. The only thing I got from my grandmother was her eyes. Heh.
我不是说她的眼珠子012---I mean, not her actual eyeballs.
但大家都说我的眼睛长得像012---But people say that my eyes look...
你要不要亲热   要啊  好啊012---Do you want to make out? Sure. Ha, ha.
你还好吗012---Are you okay?
怎么了012---What's wrong? Uh...
我只是想起了你爸爸012---Yeah, I was just thinking about your father.
只要能让你兴奋就好  不是012---Well, whatever works for you. No.
不  不  不是  是他有点把我吓到了012---No, no. Uh, he just really freaked me out before.
哦012---Oh.
那我们还得再多瞒着一个人012---Well, so we have to hide our relationship from one more person.
那又怎样  而且  我们也喜欢这样偷偷摸摸着玩012---Big deal. Besides, we've had fun hiding it.
也对012---Yeah.
嘿   嗯012---Hey. Yeah.
你有带防护用具吗012---Um, you brought protection, right?
怎么了  这里有熊出没吗012---Why? Are there, like, bears or something?
不是  那个012---No. Oh, uh...
你是说那个  没有  我简直忘了012---Oh, protection, yeah. No. That I forgot.
那我赶快去商店里买012---Ha, ha. I'll just run to the store and get some.
不   嘿  我是男人  应该我去买012---No. Hey, hey. I'm the guy. I'll get it.
你知道商店在哪里   不知道012---Do you know where the store is? No.
那你想骑我粉红脚踏车满城转悠吗012---Do you want to ride around town on my little pink bicycle?
有点想012---A little bit.
我十分钟后回来  好012---I'll be back in 10 minutes. Okay.
那不如你先泡个热澡   在浴缸里等我012---Why don't you get in the hot tub and I'll meet you there.
好012---Oh, okay.
天哪   好棒的惊喜  这房子真漂亮012---Oh, my God. What a great surprise. This is such a beautiful house.
谢谢   这是我妈的房子  这里是厨房012---Thank you. It used to be my mother's. So this is the kitchen.
