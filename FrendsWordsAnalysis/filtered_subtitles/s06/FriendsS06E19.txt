死冰箱012---Damn fridge!
嗨  乔伊  你好吗  很好啊012---Hi, Joey. How you doing? Great...
室友012---...roomie. Ah!
我们现在的确是室友  没错  你这么一提醒012---Yeah, I guess we are roommates now. Yeah! Well, now that you brought it up...
那个  我们的冰箱坏了  得买台新的012---...uh, our fridge is broken. We have to get a new one.
我打听过  你付一半400元   感激不尽012---Now, I checked around and your half is $400. Thanks a lot.
我才不付呢012---I'm not paying for half of that.
等我公寓修好了  我就搬回去了012---I'm only staying here until my apartment gets fixed.
瑞秋  这台冰箱是我出生之后  父母给买的012---Look, Rach, my parents bought this fridge just after I was born. Okay?
我用一直都没问题   你一来它就坏了012---Now, I have never had a problem with it. Then you show up and it breaks!
这说明什么012---What does that tell you?
说明冰箱不能和人一样长寿012---That refrigerators don't live as long as people?
好了  你也知道自动提款机一次只能提300元012---All right, now you know that the ATM only lets you take out 300 at a time...
剩下的100   我就收支票了012---...so I'll take a check for the other 100.
你在开玩笑   对吧012---Heh. You're joking, right?
那当然  我不收支票012---Of course I'm joking. I don't take checks.
幸好你还长的帅012---Thank God you're pretty.

不是某种树   就是某种病012---Something, either trees or disease,
罗夫很会碎碎念012---Ralph mumbles a lot.
罗夫都趁你不专心时碎碎念吗   对呀   好奇怪012---Does Ralph mumble when you're not paying attention? Yeah. It's weird.
总之  我得找个男伴012---But the thing is, I need to find a date.
你想找什么样的人012---Well, What kind of guy are you looking for?
自己有晚礼服或租得起晚礼服012---Well, Someone that has his own tux or has the ability to rent a tux.

真可爱啊  才怪012---Isn't she cute?  No.
也许我不该多嘴   但你们不是不想在公共场所012---Y'know, this is probably none of my business, but weren't you guys supposed...
被别人看到在一起吗   我们没有在一起012---...to not be seen in public together? Oh, we're not together.
没有  我们只是  在咖啡馆012---No. We're just two people who happen to have run into each other...
巧遇的两个人而已012---...here at the coffee house. Heh, this is--
噢  真狡猾012---Oh, sly.
我真想好好认识你们   不过我该走了012---Well, I really wanted to meet you guys, but I have to run.
改天见  好012---I'll see you later? Okay.
罗斯  再见  再见012---Bye, Ross. Bye. See you.
我不是故意撞到你的  先生  没关系  女士012---Oops! I did not mean to run into you like that, sir. That is quite all right, ma'am.
拜012---Bye.
她干吗走了   要上晚自习还要去赶作业012---So why's she leaving? Is it a school night and she has a lot of homework to do?
对  她明天要交分子流行病学报告012---Yes. Her molecular epidemiology paper is due tomorrow.
帮我祝她好运012---Well, tell her "good luck" with that.
还有吗   别客气012---Anyone else, huh? Bring them on.
她什么时候生日   我不知道   瑞秋  干吗问呢012---Oh! When's her birthday? I don't know, Rachel. Why?
我好久没吃儿童生日餐了012---Well, you know it's just been so long since I've been to Chuck E. Cheese.
我喜欢伊丽莎白  谢谢012---I like Elizabeth. Well, thanks.
我真的很喜欢她   叫她今年早点送曲奇饼干来012---In fact, I like her so much that you tell her I want my cookies early this year.
要薄荷巧克力饼和巧克力派012---Y'know, A box of Thin Mints and some Tag-a-longs.
你们别整他了  说真的  你们交往得怎样012---Hey-hey come on you guys, give him a break. Ross, seriously, how's it going with her?
非常好啊012---Well, actually it's been great.
她才20岁   还不想太认真012---She's 20, so she's not looking for anything too serious...
最适合现在的我012---...which is perfect for me right now.
太好了  她真的好像很不错012---Well, that is great. And seriously, she seems very nice.
谢谢   我知道你们喜欢涮我012---Thanks. I know you guys like to give me a hard time and all,
但我真的希望你们能喜欢她012---...but it really means a lot to me that you like her.
只要知道你们  我想到一个很棒的012---Just knowing that you guys are, like. Okay, I got a good one.
好012---Okay, um-Heh.
她是才12岁吗012---What is she, like, 12?
钱德   你觉得我们的沟通够吗012---Chandler, do you think we talk about our relationship enough?
够了  有水果卷吗012---Yeah. Do we have any Fruit Roll Ups?
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
好  我刚想到一个人  很适合当瑞秋的男伴012---Okay, I just thought of the perfect guy for Rachel to take to her thing.
有意思  我们也找到人了012---Oh that's so funny, we found someone too.
那好  她可以在我的人和你们的怪胎之中选一个012---Oh that's good. I guess she'll have a choice between my guy and your weirdo.
为什么我们的人是怪胎   因为你们的品味012---Why would our guy be a weirdo? Because that's just your taste.
瑞秋才不会选你的蠢人012---See, Rachel's not gonna pick your stupid guy.
是吗  没错012---Oh, yeah? Yeah.
我这个是一个做义工的律师012---My guy is a lawyer who does volunteer work.
而且他有这个东西012---And he has one of these.
脸屁股012---A face ass?
下巴窝啦   我们的这个是钱德的同事012---A chin dimple. Well, uh, our guy works with Chandler.
他人好  聪明  又会打扮012---And he's really nice and smart and he's a great dresser.
你们看过他的身体吗  没有  他是一颗飘来飘去的头012---Have you seen your guy's body? No. Our guy's just a floating head.
我这个身材很赞   他是我的按摩客人012---Well, my guy is spectacular, okay? He's a massage client.
有一次他在按摩台上  就被我看个精光光的012---And one time, um, when he was on the table, I looked at it. And I mean, all of it.
你不是不能偷看吗   报警啊   来抓我啊012---You're not supposed to look. Yeah, like there are police for that.
等等  你也给我按摩过  你会偷看  没错012---Wait! you look? You massaged me. I know.
好  你那个或许有好身材  但我们这个012---All right, your guy may have a great body, but our guy...
相当幽默   钱德式的幽默012---is really funny. Chandler funny?
我们这个舞功高强   我这个饱读诗书012---Our guy's a great dancer. My guy's well-read.
我们这个一头靓发   我这个两排洁牙012---Our guy has great hair. My guy has great teeth.
我们这个香的不得了012---Our guys smells incredible.
我们说的是一个人吗012---Do you want our guy to be your guy?
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
你的脸色不太好   乔伊012---Well, you don't look good, Joe.
冰箱坏了  我得把里面的东西都吃掉012---Well, the fridge broke, so I had to eat everything.
冷盘  冰淇淋  橙汁012---Cold cuts, ice cream, limes.
嘿   咖啡色罐子里装的是什么012---Hey, what was in that brown jar?
那个还在  已经不在了012---That's still in there? Not anymore.
那么  你准备付我多少钱012---Ahem, so, anyway, how do you want to pay me?
你要提供某种服务吗012---Is this a service you're providing me?
不是  是我要买新冰箱   我们的新冰箱012---No, for my new fridge. For our new fridge.
我们的新冰箱012---Our new fridge?
我都不在这里住了   那又怎样012---I don't live here anymore. So what?
假设我们是离婚的夫妻012---Look, okay, suppose we were a, uh, divorced couple.
我取得了孩子的监护权012---Uh-huh. And I got custody of the kid. Right?
结果孩子死了  我总得买个新孩子012---Now, suppose the kid dies and I gotta buy a new kid.
好012---0Kay.
给我400元012---Give me $400!
盖勒教授012---Professor Geller? Hmm?
喔   一名我不认识的学生012---Oh, a student I don't know.
我想问下   能不能跟您谈一会儿012---I was wondering if I could talk to you for a moment?

春游   春游012---Spring vacation. Spring vacation?
对   学校没课  很多人要出去旅行012---Yeah, we have time off, and a lot of people are going on trips--
盖勒教授  是  菲森死盯个乐教授012---Professor Geller. Yes, Professor Fiesenstinlender?
等我一分钟  我马上就好012---I'll be with you in one moment.
那我就买一盒薄荷巧克力饼012---So I will take one box of the Thin Mints.
你们不懂   伊丽莎白想找我跟她去旅行012---You don't understand. Elizabeth was about to ask me to go on a trip with her.
你这样叫慢慢来吗   我还没准备好012---Is that taking it slow? I'm not ready for this, okay?
我该怎么说   实话实说  说你还没准备好012---What do I tell her? Tell her the truth. You're not ready.
我可以试试012---I could do that.
要是她不高兴呢   你就拿芭比娃娃逗她012---Well, what if she gets upset? Then you distract her with a Barbie doll.
或者012---Or...
你也可以  你知道的012---...you could just, you know, you...
你这是在干什么012---What the hell are you doing?
什么012---What?
我干什么  你刚弄坏了我的冰箱012---What the hell am I doing? You just broke my fridge!
什么  你怎么知道它坏了012---What? How do you know if-How do you know it's even broken?
它怎么坏的我会不知道吗012---Oh, you think I don't know what breaks my fridge?
等一下012---Excuse me.
看嘛   坏了012---Well, what do you know? Broken!
要赔400元012---That'll be $400.
乔伊  我看见你推他了012---Joey, I saw you push him.
是你推的012---You pushed him.
乔伊  我没把它弄坏  它早就坏了012---Joey, I did not break this. Okay? That has been broken for a while.
钱德   记不记得我提过这是我们的冰箱012---All right. Chandler, do you remember how I told you about our fridge? Uh-huh.
我到现在还没收到你那一半钱012---I still haven't gotten the check for your half yet.
不要给他钱012---Do not give him any money.
你少插嘴   弄坏冰箱的家伙012---I'm not talking to you! You broke my fridge!
盖勒教授   你找我  是的  请进012---You wanted to see me, Professor Geller? Yes. Yes. Please come in.
噢  哦012---Mm, ooh, ooh.
门把手  对  有点玩上瘾了012---Doorknob? Yeah. It kind of grows on you.
事实上  我想和你谈谈春游的事012---Actually, I wanted to finish talking to you about spring vacation.
喔   好012---Oh, good.
听着  我012---Look, L...
我跟你在一起很开心012---Look, I've been having a great time with you.
我不想进展得太快   那样会给大家压力012---And I just don't want us to move too fast or put too much pressure on us.
所以很抱歉   我们还不能一起出去旅行012---So I'm sorry, I just don't think we should go away together yet.
那样太快了012---It's too soon.
罗斯  你误会我的意思了012---Uh, Ross, I think you misunderstood what I was saying.
我只是想告诉你   我要去佛罗里达州两星期012---I just wanted to tell you that I'm going to Florida for a couple weeks.
不012---No.
是你误会我的意思了012---I think you misunderstood what I was saying.
我的意思是  你真的好可爱012---What I meant was... You are so adorable.
这个  我们来谈谈可爱吧012---That. Let's talk about that.
嘿   嘿012---Hey. Hey.
和伊丽莎白谈得怎么样了  喔012---How did it go with Elizabeth? Huh? Oh, oh.
没事  只是一场误会  她不是要我一起去012---it was fine. It was just a misunderstanding. She didn't want me to go with her.
她只是要告诉我   她准备去佛州春游012---She just wanted to let me know that she's going to Florida for spring vacation.
等等   她是去春游  还是去度春假012---Wait, is she going for spring vacation or going for spring break.
有什么差别吗012---What's the difference?
春游就是跟爷爷奶奶一起共享天伦012---A spring vacation, you're doing nice things with your grandparents.
春假嘛   就是跟兄弟会的人上床012---Spring break, you're doing frat guys.
不是每个人的春假都那样012---Hey, you know what? Not all spring breaks are like that.
那你是怎么过的   我跟我爸去了埃及012---What did you do on yours? I went to Egypt with my dad.
我能想像   "看  爸爸  狮身人面像"012---I can see it now. "Look, Dad, it's the Sphinx."
我想伊丽莎白那么正经   不会去"春假"012---I think Elizabeth is a little more serious than, "Spring break!"
好吗   她修了我的课012---All right? Come on, she's taking my class.
还跟教授上床   我给她打电话012---And slept with the professor. I'm gonna call her.
各位  这是塞巴斯蒂012---Hey, you guys, I want you to meet Sebastian.
我们刚刚012---Hi. We just, uh--
在报摊认识   我们同时抓起了一本《原野与河流》012---We just met at the newsstand. We both grabbed for the last Field and Stream. Ha!
呃   我读过012---What, I read that.
我去给你拿杯咖啡   好啊   谢谢012---Can I get you a cup of coffee? Oh, yes. Thank you.
瑞秋  你这是什么意思  什么012---Rachel, what the hell is this? What?
你叫我们帮你找男伴   却自己带了个人来012---You ask us to find you a guy, and then you come in here with a guy of your own.
你们帮我找到人了  对012---You found me a guy? Yes.
在钱德的公司  看中了一个可爱风趣的人012---We found you a really cute, funny guy from Chandler's work.
我也找了一个   至少不是怪人012---Yeah, and I found you one, too, who is not a weirdo.
我真的很感激你们012---You know what though, guys, I really appreciate that...
不过我还是带塞巴斯蒂一起去舞会好了012---...but I'm just gonna take Sebastian to the charity.
你确定   我们的这个浑身异香012---Are you sure? Because our guy smells incredible.
别再提那个了好吗012---Would you stop it with that already?
你的咖啡   谢谢012---Here you go. Sure. Oh, thank you.
塞巴斯蒂   你是义工吗012---So, Sebastian, do you do any volunteer work?
不是  怎么了  没事012---Uh, no, not really. Why? No reason.
只是我认识一个   关心别人的单身好男人012---It's just I know a single guy who does care about other people.
你风趣吗012---Are you funny?
什么  你们这是在干吗012---Excuse me? What are you guys doing?
你风趣吗   讲个笑话来听听012---Are you funny? Tell us a joke!
我只是想和瑞秋喝杯咖啡012---Look, I just wanted to have coffee with Rachel.
是啊   很多人都想012---Well, so do a lot of people.
说实话   我想我该走了012---Actually, uh, I gotta get going. Oh, but you--
有空打电话   不过你没给我电话号码012---Give me a call sometime. But you didn't give me your number.
那好  改天见012---Okay, see you later.
原来他蛮风趣的012---Turns out he is kind of funny.
我简直不能相信012---I cannot believe you guys!
他这么好   就这样被你们赶走了012---He was really nice and he just left because of you!
"塞巴斯蒂"   听起来像猫的名字012---Yeah, but, "Sebastian"? What is that, a cat's name?
你知道我发现了什么   瑞秋  他很胆小012---You know what I noticed, Rachel, he scares easy.
你难道带这样的人去舞会012---Now, is that the kind of guy you want to take to a ball?
"塞巴斯蒂   要不要跳舞"012---"Sebastian, would you like to dance?"
"好  我得走了"012---"Uh, okay. I gotta go. Aah!"
够了  别说了   瑞秋  对不起012---All right, guys stop it. Rachel, we're very sorry.
我们太过分了012---That is a very insensitive thing for us to do.
这样吧  让我们补偿你   我们有两个好男人让你挑012---You know what? Let us make it up to you. We've two really great guys for you.
对啊   你有什么损失012---Yeah, what have you got to lose?
如果你选我这边的人   搞不好会认识让你心动的人012---Y'know you might even end up with someone really special. If you pick my guy.
好吧  好   你愿意见我们找的人012---All right. Okay. So you will meet our guys?
是啊   我愿意012---Yes, I'll meet them.
你选谁都行   你自己决定012---It doesn't matter which one you choose. y'know? It's completely up to you.
我们这个才叫完美012---Our guy is perfect.
或者你也可以选012---Or you could go out with the guy Phoebe deemed...
菲比看不上眼的人012---...not good enough to go outwith herself. Ugh!
菲比  你在这儿   你弄坏我的冰箱012---Phoebe, there you are! Okay, you broke my fridge.
欠我400元012---You owe me 400 bucks.
好吧  真的012---Okay, sure. Really?
技术上来说   你欠我600元   你最近十次的试镜012---Ooh, technically, you owe me $600 for sending out happy thoughts...
我都有给你祝福012---...on your last 10 auditions.
那就算扯平了012---Call it even?
好吧012---0Kay.
回来了  伊丽莎白怎么说012---There you are. So, what did Elizabeth say?
她真的是要去德通纳  渡"春假  呼呼"012---Well, turns out she is going to Daytona for "spring break, woo-hoo."
那就有湿衫美女大赛   男生会向女生身上射水012---That means wet T-shirt contests, guys doing shots off of girls' bodies...
第二天醒来甚至不知道一起睡的是谁012---...waking up next to people you don't even know.
看来  她会玩得很爽了012---Man, she is gonna have a great time!
她要住可乐娜酒店吗012---Is she staying at the Hotel Corona?
你熟悉那酒店  当然  我参加过81年春假  呼呼012---You know the hotels? Sure! I was there, Spring Break '81! Woo-hoo!
81年  你才13岁012---In 1981, you were 13.
那又怎样  我开车过去  卖了T恤  玩得好开心012---So what? I drove down, sold T-shirts. I had a blast.
你们知道谁最会疯   醉酒的女大学生012---And y'know who knows how to party? Drunk college chicks.
知道了  她不能去012---Okay, she can't go.
罗斯  你不能阻止她去  你们这才交往多久啊012---Ross, You can't tell her not to go. You just started dating.
那我该怎么办  不怎么办   你只能冷处理哦012---Then what am I supposed to do? Nothing. Just be cool with it.
要是她跑去跟一堆人上床呢012---What if she goes down there and sleeps with a bunch of guys?
那这次   你就别娶她了012---Well, maybe you don't marry this one.
我真为你能去旅行而高兴012---I'm so glad you're going on this trip.
就是啊   我这学期这么用功012---Yeah, I've been working so hard this semester.
真的需要疯狂一下   好好缓解下压力012---I really need to go crazy, you know? Blow off some steam.
当然   当然需要了012---Sure. Sure.
我不知道你的计划到底定了没有012---Look, I don't know if your plans are finalized yet...
但我知道  还有一个办法可以缓解压力012---...but I know another great way to blow off steam.
什么办法  你喜欢做手工艺吗012---What? Are you into crafts at all?
罗斯  你还好吗  我当然很好012---Ross, are you okay? Uh, yeah. Of course I'm okay.
我只是在表示  支持012---Heh, I'm just being, uh, supportive.
支持你和你的旅行012---Supportive of you and this whole trip...
还有   这是这是什么012---...and what-What is, uh--? What's this?
是泳衣啊   你要穿着它去见人012---It's a bathing suit? To wear in front of people?
你这样算支持吗   这样是吗012---Is that supportive? Is this?
嘿  太好了012---Hey. Good, good, good.
嘿  嗨012---Hey. Hi.
很高兴你答应见我们找的人   哦012---We're glad you decided to meet our guy. Oh.
你一定会很喜欢他的012---You're gonna like him so much.
你准备什么时候见他   不知道啊012---So umm, when do you want to meet him? I don't know.
我明晚不加班   明晚不错012---I don't work late tomorrow night. Tomorrow night is good.
不过  现在能做的事  为什么要拖到明天012---but uh, y'know what? why put off something till tomorrow that you can do right now. Ha-ha-ha.

嗨  嗨012---Hi. Hi.
你来晚了  她跟我们那个在一起了012---Okay, you're too late okay? because she's already with our guy.
天哪  对啊  我是来晚了  他们正坐在沙发上聊天呢012---Oh, my God, you're right, I am too late. They're sitting on the couch and talking.
拜托012---Come on.
瑞秋  怎样   这是派屈克012---Rachel?  Yeah?  This is Patrick. Yeah?
喔  嗨   嗨012---Oh. Hi. Hi.
他就是我说的那个人012---This is the guy I was telling you about.
相信我  这套西装  太委屈里面的一流身材了012---Believe me, this suit does not do justice to what's underneath it.
懂了012---0Kay.
但是菲比  什么  你们这样让我好为难012---But Pheebs, Yeah? I'm just sort of in the middle of something.
没事的   没关系   你坐过来012---Oh, okay. That's okay. Have a seat.
你不能这样   也许我得走了012---You can't do that! Maybe I should go.
你坐下   我们赢定了012---Just sit down, we're winning.
好吧  也许我该走了012---Okay, you know what? Maybe I should go.
不  不要  你也给我坐下  坐下012---No, no! Have a Seat! Have a seat!
瑞秋  你还没摸过艾达的头发012---Rachel, Rachel, you haven't touched Eldad's hair.
超柔顺的  你摸摸看  不必了012---It is the softest hair. Touch it. Yeah, I'm good.
瑞秋  派屈克很有钱   拿钱砸她012---Rachel, Patrick is really rich. Give her some money.
菲比   这个免费按摩的代价太高了012---Y'know what Phoebe? this isn't really worth the free massage.
没错   派屈克   再见012---That's right, Patrick. Bye-bye.
艾达绝对是个好舞伴012---Eldad is much more cooperative and he can dance.
跳个舞给瑞秋看看012---You dance for Rachel.
不   拜托   别跳了012---No-no! don't dance for me, please! Don't!
你们这是怎么搞的012---What is the matter with you guys'?
没错  大家来说说清楚012---Yeah, okay, let's talk it out.
这里只有我一人觉得尴尬吗012---Am I the only one that this is embarrassing for?
我也有一点尴尬  嘘嘘012---I'm a little embarrassed. Shh, shh.
该尴尬的是你们  这真是可笑012---I'll tell you who should be embarrassed. It's you guys. Come on! This is ridiculous!
谢谢你们   但我不需要你们给我安排约会012---Thank you very much, but I do not need you to get me a date.
那你为什么叫我们  我还没说完012---Then why did she ask us to help-I am still talking!
你们还把我真正喜欢的人赶走012---Then you chase away the one guy that I actually liked.
我没有冒犯的意思  真的  恭喜你012---I mean, no offense to you guys. Really, congratulations on...
你那么有钱012---...all the cash.
还有你   哇   你的头发真柔顺012---And you really-Wow, you do have very soft hair.
但我更愿意跟我自己选择的人参加晚会012---But I'd much rather go to the ball all by myself than go through any more of this!
再见012---Good bye.
你用什么特别的润发露吗012---Now, do you use some sort of special conditioner on that hair?
有  木瓜粹取液  谢谢012---Yes, papaya extract. Thank you.
好好去玩吧  我会的012---So, uh, have a great time down there. I will.
你带那套泳衣了吗   带了012---Did you pack that bathing suit? Yeah.
我刚才把它藏起来了   蛮好玩的012---It was pretty funny when I hid it for a while, huh?
总之012---Anyway. Um...
我还是担心那套泳装012---I am worried about that bathing suit.
倒不是因为太暴露   那个呢我不在意012---Not because it's revealing, which I'm fine with.
对  我是关心你的健康012---No, I'm concerned about your health.
怕你晒到012---Um, sun exposure.
放心  我带了一大堆防晒油012---Oh, don't worry, I have plenty of sun block.
防晒系数达到30   好吧012---It's SPF 30. All right.
如果里面装的真能到30就好了012---Well, if what's in the bottle is actually 30.
有时候买的是30   里面只能达到4   我发誓012---I mean, sometimes you get 30, sometimes it's 4, and I swear...
有很多  都只是牛奶而已012---...more often than not, it's just milk.
罗斯  你放心012---Ross, it's gonna be okay.
我不是要去跟一堆男生鬼混012---I'm not going down there to hook up with a bunch of guys.
我真的很喜欢你  我珍惜我们的关系012---I really like you. I like how things are going between us.
真的  对啊012---Really? Yeah.
我只是跟朋友们出去放松玩玩012---I'm just going down there to relax and hang outwith my friends.

没关系   我玩得很开心012---That's all right. I ended up having a really good time.
晚会很成功  募到了很多款  而且受到了关注012---Y'know, the charity was a big success, they raised a lot of money and awareness.
到底  为什么募款012---So, what was it for, anyway?
好像是一种疾病吧012---I wanna say a disease.
嘿   嘿012---Hey. Hey.
罗斯留了条奇怪的信息   叫我们看MTV台012---I just got this weird message from Ross. He said turn on MTV. I don't know.
