菲比   你能帮我挑个订婚戒指给摩妮卡吗012---Pheebs, can you help me pick an engagement ring for Monica?
我没法决定   好难挑啊012---I can't figure this out. It's so hard.
我要选第凡内切割法的  还是公主方切割法的还是012---Should I get her a Tiffany cut, or a princess cut or a--
噢噢   被纸切割法012---Ow! Paper out!
你跟其他人说了吗012---Now, have you told anyone else?
没有  我没告诉其他人  我不想让摩妮卡发现012---No, I don't want to tell anybody else because I don't want Monica to find out.
可你告诉我了012---You told me.
因为我信任你   你是我最好的朋友之一012---Well, that's because I trust you, and we're best friends...
还有我正在看戒指广告的时候   你进来了012---...and you walked in on me while I was looking at ring brochures.
下次我不敲门进来的话012---Yeah well, once again, not knocking pays off.
我只希望你不要刚好在蹲马桶就好了  我希望也是012---I only wish you hadn't been on the toilet. Me too.
嘿   嘿012---Hey. Hey.
钱德  要不要去喝咖啡  好啊  走吧012---So Chandler, wanna go to the coffeehouse? Oh, all right.
好极了  我们正想找你们一块去012---Oh, perfect. We were just gonna see if you wanted to go.
不了  我们去另外一家012---Oh, well, we don't, because we got the other place.
真没礼貌012---How rude.
抱歉  你想咬一口吗012---Oh, I'm sorry. You want a bite?
老友记  第六季  第23集  订婚戒指012---Friends  S06E23  The One With The Ring
你和保罗交往得怎么样012---So how are things going with Paul?
很好啊012---Good. Huh.
只不过   他不太爱说话012---Although, you know, he's a private guy. Mm-hm.
真想让他稍微敞开点心胸   好分享他的感受012---You know, I wish I could get him to open up a bit. Share some feelings.
这太容易了   把他当成一罐打不开的泡菜012---That's easy. You just have to think of him as a jar of pickles that won't open.
你是说012---So, what are you saying?
我应该把他泡进热水里   然后把他的头往桌子上撞012---I should run him under hot water and bang his head against a table?
不是  那是严刑逼供012---No, that's what you do when you want to get the truth out of someone.
嗨  嗨012---Hi. Hi.
你好吗   看我的012---How are you? Watch this.
嘿  保罗  嘿   菲比012---Hey, Paul. Hi, Phoebe.
你最近好吗012---So how are things going with you?
没说的012---Can't complain.

嗨  罗斯  我也很高兴见到你012---Great to-Ross, good to see you too.
我很好   拜  保重012---Good. Bye. You take care.
菲比   你们在搞什么鬼   钱德还放我们鸽子012---Hey, Pheebs, what was the deal with you and Chandler blowing us off before?
很奇怪  对吧012---Ah, that was so weird, huh?
菲比   为什么要这么做012---Phoebe, why did you do it?
不是我   是钱德012---I didn't do it. It was Chandler.
他  他在生你的气012---He's-He's mad at you.
什么   为什么  拜托   你明知故问012---What? Why? Oh, please. I think you know why.
我想不起来012---I can't think of anything.
罗斯  你是古生物学家  再往下挖深一点012---Come on, Ross. You're a paleontologist. Dig a little deeper.
等等   是不是因为两个星期前   乔伊和我没找他012---Wait a minute, is it because Joey and I didn't invite him to that Knicks game...
去看纽约尼克斯队的球赛012---...a couple weeks ago?
你觉得他会为这种事生气吗012---Do you think that's something that he'd be mad at you for?
应该会  那好  我也是这么想012---I guess it could. Well, then I think that's it.
如果他生气了  他为什么不说呢012---Well, if he's angry, he really shouldn't just cover it up.
我希望他能告诉我012---I wish he'd just tell me the truth.
那你应该抓着他的头012---Oh, if that's what you want...
泡进热水里  再把他的头往桌子上撞012---...then you really should run him under hot water and bang his head against the table.
亲爱的   我在中国花园订了位   你好了吗012---Honey, I made a reservation at China Garden. Is that okay?
可以啊   太棒了012---Yeah, that's great.
先等等   给我说说说   你今天好不好012---But first, wait, talk to me, talk to me. Tell me about your day.
蛮好的012---It was fine.
好吧012---0Kay.
嘿   你在想什么  你此刻在想什么012---Hey, what are you thinking? What are you thinking right now?
我在想你穿这条裙子真漂亮012---I'm thinking that you are looking really fine in that dress.
太好了  保罗  但是012---Yeah, that's great, Paul. But, you know...
我想知道  哇  好结实012---I want to know what-Wow, those are really great.
我想知道012---I just want to know...
在这坚强平静的外表下面到底隐藏着什么012---...what is behind this strong, silent exterior?
俗语说静水深流012---You know, they say that still waters run deep...
我想在你的心中畅游012---...and I want to swim in yours.
你是说做爱012---Are you talking about having sex?
不  保罗012---No, PauL
我一点也不了解你012---I don't know anything about you.
比如你的童年   跟我聊聊你小时候的事吧012---You know, like your childhood. Tell me about your childhood.
很普通012---Normal.
好吧  那青春期呢  如何  那是一段痛苦的时光012---Okay, well, then how about puberty? Come on. That's always a painful time.
你的朋友请你参加聚会012---You know, your friends invite you to a slumber party...
趁你睡着   把你的手放进热水里012---...and stick your hand in warm water...
让你尿在睡袋里012---...while you're sleeping so that you pee in your sleeping bag.
我没碰过那种事012---No, that never happened to me.
那是你走运   没碰上那个贱人莎朗麦杰斯基012---Well, you're lucky you never met that bitch, Sharon Majeski.
总之012---Anyway...
你有后悔过吗012---The rest of your life, you know. Any regrets?
没有012---No.
好吧   保罗  我要求得不多012---All right, Paul. I'm not asking for a lot here.
你就告诉我点什么   随便什么都行012---Okay? Just give me something. Anything.
好吧  好012---okay. okay
我6岁那年012---When I was 6 years old... Mm-hm.
想要一辆大脚踏车012---...I wanted a Big Wheel.
父母却送我一只  塑料小鸡012---And instead, my parents got me this little...
骑着到处跳的那种012---...plastic chicken that you hop around on.
太难为情了  小朋友都取笑我012---It was embarrassing. Kids made fun of me.
那一年  真够难过的012---That was a pretty tough year.
太好了  你看吧012---That's great. See? Heh.
我觉得我更了解你了   谢谢012---I already feel like I know you a little better. Thank you.
好  我们去吃饭吧   走吧012---Okay, come on. Now we can go eat. Let's go.
我好惨012---It was horrible.
他们都叫我 "小鸡孩"012---They called me "Chicken Boy."
五年级我跟别人打架   其实也不算真打了012---In fifth grade, I got in a fight. Well, it wasn't really a fight.
理查达伦一拳打在我鼻子上012---Richard Danville bit me on the nose.
我摔倒了  这里留了个小伤疤  你看嘛012---I fell down, still have a little scar right here. You can see it.
有  我看见了012---Yeah, yeah. I see the scar.
保罗  你听我说  你能分享这些感受真是太好了012---Listen, Paul, I think this is really great that, you know, you've shared your feelings.
真的很棒012---It's really... It's beautiful.
但是你刚才说我们去吃什么012---But, urn, what do you say we go share some food?
我现在吃不下012---No, I couldn't eat now.
说什么啊   你最爱吃宫保鸡丁了012---What are you talking about? You love their Kung Pao chicken.
鸡012---Chicken?
鸡弟弟  天哪  对不起  我不是故意的012---Chicken Boy! I'm sorry. I didn't mean to do that.
逛了几百家首饰店   一无所获012---Well, this is the nine millionth ring store we've been to...
还是找不到完美的戒指012---...and I can't find the perfect ring.
难看  难看  难看012---Ugly ring, ugly ring, ugly ring...
漂亮  精品012---It's a beautiful selection.
要不然   你不要送戒指012---Okay, so maybe you don't get her a ring.
送点不一样的012---Maybe you do something different, you know?
例如订婚手镯   或是订婚皇冠012---Maybe you get her an engagement bracelet. Or an engagement tiara.
或者  一把订婚独立战争毛瑟枪012---Ooh! An engagement Revolutionary War musket.
真高兴选你来帮忙012---You know, I'm so glad I picked you to help me with this.
想像一下你单膝跪地012---Can't you imagine getting down on one knee...
向她献上这把漂亮的武器012---...and handing her this gorgeous piece of weaponry?
我看   还是送戒指好了012---Yeah, I'm gonna stick with the ring.
这只好漂亮   我喜欢这只012---Oh, this one's nice. I like it this one.
先生  大哥  我可以看这枚戒指吗012---Sir? Kind sir, can I see this one?
等等   你找我来就是因为012---Wait a minute. This is the reason you brought me, okay?
我会砍价  所以接下来交给我处理012---I know how to haggle. So let me handle this from here on out.
有什么需要吗012---Can I help you?
有  我想看那枚戒指   要么什么都不看  随便012---Yes, I would like to see that ring, please. Or not. Whatever.
这是一只20年代的戒指012---This ring is from the 1920s.
上面有1点5克拉钻石   两侧各镶有蓝宝石012---It's a one-and-a-half karat diamond with sapphires on either side.
先生  你能不能012---Sir, could I ask you to, um...?
拿出这只戒指向我求婚012---Could you hold out that ring and ask me to marry you?
好啊   好012---Okay. Okay.
你愿意嫁给我吗012---Will you marry me?
天哪  就是它了  就选这个012---Oh, my God, that's it. That's the ring.
多少钱   钱德   让我来012---How much is it? Chandler, I will handle this.
多少钱012---How much is it?
8千6百元块美元012---Eight thousand six hundred.
我们出10块012---We will give you $10.
你到底想不想买啊  想  想012---Are you interested in this ring? Yes. Yes.
但我只能出8千块012---But I can only pay $8000.
好  8千可以  我们坚持只付10块钱012---Okay. I can let it go for 8. We stand firm at $10.
您用什么付帐   刷信用卡012---How would you like to pay? Uh, credit card.
喔   糟了  我的卡在乔伊那边了012---Oh, no. No, no, but I lent my credit card to Joey.
没事  我回去拿   你守住戒指  好的012---Okay, I'll go get it. You guard the ring. Okay.
刚才的事很抱歉啊012---Listen, I'm sorry about before.
你们这里有10块钱的东西吗012---Do you have anything here for $10?
有啊   我有两张崭新的012---Uh, yes. I have these two rather beautiful...
5元钞票012---...five-dollar bills.
我出1块钱跟你买012---I'll give you $1 for them.
嘿  记得钱德和菲比昨天把我们甩了吗012---Hey, remember how Chandler and Phoebe blew us off yesterday?
不记得012---No.
记得吗  你当时在吃披萨   对啊012---Remember, you were eating pizza? Yeah.
很明显  钱德在生气012---Well, apparently Chandler's angry at us...
就为我们两星期前   没帮他买纽约尼克斯队的球票012---...for not getting him a ticket to that Knicks game a couple weeks ago.
我们为什么要帮他买票012---What, we were supposed to just get him a ticket?
那家伙老是揩我们的油   就是啊012---That guy is always mooching off of us. Yeah.
但不管怎么样   我想我们该做点什么012---Anyway, I still think we should try to patch things up, you know?
也许我们可以给他搞张尼克斯队比赛的票和他一起去看012---Like, maybe we could get him tickets to another Knicks game and invite him.
好主意   而且他的信用卡也在我这里012---Wow, that's a great idea. And I still have his credit card.
您的帐单012---Here you go.
嘿  嘿  我有卡  拿去吧012---Hey, hey. I got this one. Here you go.
我跟你说  有时候我真搞不懂钱德012---You know, I gotta tell you, sometimes I just don't get Chandler.
我们一直背着你出去玩012---You know, me and him do stuff all the time without you...
你也不会生气012---...and you don't get all upset.
一直   一直012---All the time? All the time.
我的天哪   我的天哪012---Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
还在哭   跟小女生一样012---Still crying? Like a little girl.
我知道   我知道都是我不好012---I know, I know, I know. This is all my fault.
是我要他敞开心胸的012---I wanted him to open up.
但是我不知道我会放出一头012---But God, I didn't know that I was gonna unleash...
哭哭啼啼又黏人的怪物012---...this weepy, clingy, moist monster.
我只知道有两种方法可以让男人闭嘴012---You know, I only know of two sure-fire ways to shut a man up.
其中一种是性爱012---And one of them is sex.
另外一个是呢   不知道012---What's the other? I Don't know.
我从来不需要用到另一种012---I never had to use the other one.
我只是说  如果作爱就没时间讲话012---I'm just saying, you know, if we're having sex, he's not talking.
没错  话多的是你012---Ah, that's right. You're the talker.
不管怎么说  是个好主意  对012---Anyway, uh, great idea. Yeah.
我得去趟商店   我答应去帮他买纸巾012---Um, I gotta go to the store. I told him that I would buy him some more tissues.
我们这里有  不  你们没有012---Uh, we have some here. No, you don't.
好  我还想试试这顶王冠012---Okay. Um, I'd also like to try on the tiara.
太好了012---Oh, yeah. Okay.
你觉得怎么样   太花了012---Wow, what do you think? Too much?
有点点012---A tad.
好吧  把皇冠放回去012---Then take the tiara back...
再让我试试那把枪012---...and let me hold the musket again.
少了点什么012---Something's missing.
好   把我朋友挑的戒指拿给我看看012---Let me see the ring that my friend picked out.
那枚20年代的钻戒呢012---Where's the 1920s princess-cut ring?
刚刚卖给那位先生了012---I just sold it to that gentleman.
完蛋了012---Oh, my God!
等等   别走012---Wait, no!
放我出去   快点012---Let me out! Now!
瑞秋012---Rachel?
不是012---No.
保罗  你好吗   还好012---How are you, Paul? Okay.
钱德012---Chandler...
你爸抱过你吗   没有  他抱过你吗012---...did your dad ever hug you? No. Did he hug you?
没有  没有012---No. No.
我父亲从来没拥抱过我012---It's just that my dad never did.
我好想念我爸012---I miss my dad.
你可以去赌城   看我爸亲别人的爸爸012---Well, you can see my dad in Vegas kissing other dads.
嘿   钱德   怎样012---Hey, Chandler? Yeah?
你能不能012---Would you...?
你能不能抱抱我012---Would you hug me?
我现在有点忙  保罗  我爸以前都这么说012---I'm a little busy here, Paul. That's exactly what my dad used to say.
好啦  就一下下  来吧  快点012---Okay. A quick one. Come on, hug it out.
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
行了吧012---There you go.
好了012---0Kay.
再多5秒钟   够了012---Five more seconds-Okay.
乔伊  什么   嘿012---Joey! What? Hey, what--?
嗨   保罗  是吧012---Hi. Paul, is it?
你拿了我的信用卡  是  在我的012---Do you have my credit card? Yeah. It's in my...
我的口袋里012---In my pocket.
后面的口袋  后袋  幸好012---My back pocket. Back pocket. Thank God.
听着  我买了今晚尼克斯队的票  我不能去012---Listen, I got tickets to the Knicks tonight. I can't go.
去啦   会很好玩的012---Come on, it'll be fun.
我  你  罗斯  也许还有保罗012---Me, you, Ross and... Paul, probably.
钱德   我找到了最完美的戒指012---Chandler, I found the perfect ring.
真不错   但我还是想买之前挑重的那款012---Oh, that's pretty nice, but I'm gonna go with the one I picked first.
天哪  钱德  你挑的那只戒指不在了  没了012---Oh, wake up, Chandler. The one you picked is gone. It's over.
什么012---What?
对不起  被人买走了  我想拦住他  却被他们关进监狱里012---Some guy bought it. I'm sorry. I tried to stop him but they put me in jail.
把你关进监狱里   就是两道门之间的小监狱012---They put you in jail? The little jail between the doors!
菲比  我要你看着那只戒指  我知道  对不起012---Phoebe, I asked you to guard the ring. I know. I'm sorry.
你看  这只更漂亮   摩妮卡莫不会看到其他戒指的012---But, you know, this ring is better. And Monica never even saw the other ring.
是啊  但是他用那只戒指向我求婚时  我起了鸡皮疙瘩012---Yeah. But when he proposed to me with the ring, I got goose bumps.
也许是因为那个男人  是因为那枚戒指012---Maybe it was the guy. It was the ring.
嘿  他听到票的事兴奋吗  不  他回绝了012---Hey, so was he excited about the tickets? No. He blew us off.
什么  真的012---What? I know.
真不敢相信012---I can't believe it.
告诉你012---Can I tell you something?
我现在真的有点生他的气012---I'm a little mad at him now.
告诉你012---Can I tell you something?
我也是012---Me too.
他生气不告诉我们012---You know what? He didn't want to talk to us about being angry?
那好吧  我们也什么都不要告诉他012---Well, maybe we don't talk to him at all.
把他打入冷宫   没错012---Freeze him out. That's right.
我喜欢  给他好看012---I like it. Ah? We'll show him.
从今以后  就是乔伊与罗斯  最佳拍档012---From now on, it's gonna be Joey and Ross, best friends.
我们将是新的乔伊与钱德012---Okay, we're gonna be the new Joey and Chandler. Ha, ha.
嗨  我回来了012---Hi, I'm back.
我把想说的话都写下来了012---Hey! I have so much more to tell you. I've written it all down.
真好012---Oh, that's great.
其实  这个012---No, actually, that's...
真是太好了  真的好棒012---That's great. That's really great.
说真的  写字  写东西  会燃起012---You know, I gotta tell you, writing, all that writing, it gets me, uh...
燃起我的欲火012---It gets me kind of hot.
等等  你听这个012---Wait, wait. Listen to this:
你知道我小时候想当什么吗012---Know what I wanted to be when I was that age?
情圣012---A lover?
冲浪运动员   是吗  冲浪运动员012---A surfer. Oh, yeah. A surfer?
我想与海浪为伍  停一停012---I wanted to be one with the waves-Honey, hold on real quick.
等一下  让我坐得更舒服一点012---Hold on a second. Let me just get a little more comfortable here.
等一下012---Wait, now wait a second,
我这样是不是太暴露了  不会012---This isn't too revealing, is it? No.
当年那个小家伙呢012---Whatever happened to that little dude?
充满了梦想012---So full of dreams.
我不在乎那个什么小家伙012---I don't care about the little dude.
我没办法   我听不下去了012---I can't. I cannot listen to any more of this.
只有心理医师才想听这些话012---Y'know, the only person who'd listen to this is a mental health professional.
因为他们听这个每1小时赚1百元012---And that's only because they get paid $100 an hour.
你知道我听到现在可以赚多少012---Do you know how much money I could've made listening to you?
2000块钱012---Two thousand dollars.
你知道我什么时候算出来的   就在你说话的时候012---And you know when I figured that out? While you were talking.
你居然想让我闷死吗  14个小时前012---I can't believe you're trying to stifle me, when just 14 hours ago...
我们刚刚谈到我妈就是想这么对我的012---...we figured out that that's exactly what my mother was trying to do to me.
对不起012---I'm sorry.
我不是有意的  我不是想把你闷死012---I don't mean... I didn't mean to stifle you.
我只是没办法控制自己012---This is all just a little overwhelming.
瑞秋012---Oh, Rachel.
对不起012---I'm so sorry.
我不是故意的012---I didn't mean to overwhelm you.
只不过情绪一发泄012---It's just that when those gates open...
就容易一发不可收拾012---...it's hard to close them.
不过现在没事了  真的012---But they are closed now. Believe me.
我很高兴  你跟我分享这些事012---I'm so glad. I'm so glad you shared.
也很高兴你说完了012---And I'm glad that you're done.
那我们要不要012---So, what do you say we, um...
我求之不得012---I'd really like that. Mm-hm.
真是太棒了012---That was so good.
嘿   我居然听了你的话012---Hey. I can't believe you talked me into...
买了这只造型怪异的廉价戒指012---...buying this stupid gumball-machine-looking ring.
它才不廉价呢   看它多漂亮啊012---It's not a stupid gumball-machine-looking ring. It's a beautiful ring.
才不漂亮呢012---No, it's not.
另外一枚戒指012---When I looked at the other ring...
我能看见拿给摩妮卡时的表情012---...I could see Monica's face when I gave it to her...
还能看到她点头答应012---...and I could see her saying yes.
看看这只戒指   怎么看它都是一只戒指012---When I look at this ring, all I see is a ring.
只有近看  才能看到我的眼睛012---Unless I look at it really closely, and then I can see my own eye.
这是我这辈子要做的最重要的一件事012---Look, this is the most important thing I'm gonna do in my life.
我希望做的完美无缺012---I want to make sure it's perfect.
好   那我们或许还有办法把那只戒指要回来012---Okay. There may be a way that we could get the other ring back.
我偷听到那人告诉珠宝店  他准备求婚的地方012---Because I heard the guy tell the jeweler where he was gonna propose.
或许我们可以说服他交换或怎么样012---So maybe we could get him to trade rings or something.
我做不到012---I can't do that.
你总不能给她那只廉价的戒指吧012---Well, you certainly can't give her that stupid gumball ring.
他在那012---There he is.
还好  他还没求婚   那个女的没有戴戒指012---Okay, and he hasn't proposed yet. She has no ring on her finger.
你真行   下次我们应该一起来破案012---Wow, you're good. After this, we should solve crimes.
没错  去请他过来012---Yeah. Okay. Go get him.
好吧012---Oh, okay.
抱歉   先生  请您过来一下  有您的电话012---Excuse me, sir. Could you come with me, please? You have a phone call.
是谁   是你的办公室打来的012---Who is it? It is your office.
你知道是谁吗  约翰012---Do you know who at my office? John.
约翰啊  太好了012---Oh, John. Great.
他来了   你好012---There he is. Hi. Hi. Okay.
是这样  珠宝店搞错了012---Okay, there was a mix-up at the jewelry store.
你打算用来求婚的戒指是我预订的012---The ring you're about to propose with was supposed to be held for me.
所以我想把它换回来012---So I'm gonna need to have that back.
不过作为交换   我愿意拿这只更漂亮更值钱的戒指和你交换012---But in exchange, I'm willing to trade you this beautiful, more expensive ring.
哇  要是我就换了012---Wow, I would trade.
的确很漂亮   但是我就想用这只求婚  失陪了012---It is beautiful, but I'm gonna use this one. Now, if you'll excuse me.
不  不  这位是我的未婚妻   她就是要这枚戒指012---No, no. See, this is my fiancée, and her heart was set on that ring.
你不会想伤她的心吧012---You don't want to break her heart now, do you?
对啊   你想伤一位垂死女人的心吗012---Yeah. Do you want to break a dying woman's heart?
你要死了012---You're dying?
她快死了012---Yeah, she's dying...
很明显  她快咳死了012---...of a cough, apparently.
对  这是我临死前的愿望  如果我不能戴着这只戒指安息012---It's my dying wish to have that ring. See, if I'm not buried with that ring...
我就会变成孤魂野鬼游荡在阴间012---...then my spirit will wander the netherworld--
好了  够了  亲爱的012---Okay, that's enough, honey.
我不知道012---Oh, I don't know.
让我看看戒指   当然  看吧012---Let me see the ring. Great. Okay, here.
好吧  谢谢  谢谢  谢谢012---All right, I'll do it. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
你会嫁给一个很棒的男人012---And you are about to marry a wonderful man.
嘿   我要娶一个快死的女人012---Hey, I'm marrying a dead woman.

过去的事就别提了  好吧012---Water under the bridge. Forget it! Okay.
我本来想等到正式公开的那天  可我太兴奋了还是忍不住要告诉你们012---I was gonna wait till it was official, you know, but I got so excited I just had to tell you guys...
因为你们是我最好的朋友012---...because you're my best friends.
我真想哭   别再哭了012---I think I'm gonna cry. Oh. No more crying.
拜托   我刚甩掉一个爱哭宝宝  小心我也甩了你012---Please, I just dumped one cry baby. I'll dump you too.

你先告诉她012---You told her before you told us?
她进来的时候正好看到我在看戒指广告012---Well, she walked in while I was looking at ring brochures.
