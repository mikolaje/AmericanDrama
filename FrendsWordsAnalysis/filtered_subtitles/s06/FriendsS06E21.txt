好  该钱德了  好012---Okay, Chandler. Okay.
你的星座运势显示012---And your horoscope says:
"本月5日  某个特别的人会送你礼物"012---"On the 5th, a special someone is going to give you a gift."
哇  那就先谢了012---Oh, well, thank you in advance. Mm. Ha, ha.
"但会在12日  引发恋人间的口角"012---"But the 12th brings a lover's spat."
你一定是拿我送的礼物开玩笑了012---You're going to make a joke about my special present.
你为什么要这样啊012---Why would you do that?
等等  "19日  暗恋你的人会向你表白"012---Oh, wait and "On the 19th, a secret crush announces itself."
大家好  嘿012---Hey, guys. Hey
天哪   是《麦克与吉事》的乔伊崔比亚尼012---Oh, my God! It's Joey Tribbiani of Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.
没错   今天才开拍012---That's right. It's your first day.
你准备好要和机器人拍档   一起打击邪恶势力了吗012---So are you psyched to fight fake crime with your robot sidekick?
还用问吗   在连续剧里担当主角012---Am I psyched? The lead in my own TV series?
我都想好多年了012---I've dreamed about this for years.
怎么可能没准备好012---Why have I not been preparing?
不  乔伊  你这次一定技惊四座012---No, Joey, you're gonna be great.
不过  菲比  我得跟机器人对戏   我对科技一窍不通012---But I gotta act with a robot. Pheebs, I don't know anything about technology.
除了上色情网站外  我连用钱德的电脑都不会012---I can't even use Chandler's computer, except to find porn.
那还是因为色情网站开机后是首页才找到的012---And that's only because it's there when you turn it on.
我们的恋人口角  本月怕是会提前爆发啊012---Our lover's spat will start a little early this month.
我等着012---I'll be waiting.
老友记  第六季  第21集  拜见岳父012---Friends  S06E21  The One Where Ross Meets Elizabeth's Dad
你是先看封面然后选书吗  真不该这样啊012---Are you judging them by their covers? Because you're really not supposed to do that.
不是  我想选一本来用  我又要写新书了012---No, I'm just deciding which one to use. I'm going to start writing another book.
因为上一本很畅销012---Because the last one was such a big seller?
如果你好奇  告诉你吧  我已经写了14本书了012---Well, if you must know, I have written 14 books.
因为读者只有我一个012---And as I'm the only one who has read them...
我可以告诉你们  反响很热烈012---...I can tell you that they have all been very well received.

我刚得知伊丽莎白她爸想见我012---I just found out Elizabeth's dad wants to meet me.
等等   电话别挂012---Wait a minute. Hold the phone.
你难道不是伊丽莎白的爸爸吗012---You're not Elizabeth's dad?
拜托啦   我真的想让她爸爸喜欢我012---Come on, guys. I really want this guy to like me.
你们要是能留在这里  帮我说说好话012---It would really help me out if you guys could be here...

我们留在这里   谢了012---We'll be here. Thanks.
我们都清楚家长会不好对付啊012---We know how tough those parent-teacher conferences can be.
这是你的办公室场景012---So here's your office set. Wow, huh?
麦克麦可维利   私家侦探012---Mac Machiavelli, Private Investigator. Eh?
试穿一下演出服吧012---Let's get you to wardrobe for a fitting. Okay.
嘿  我什么时候可以跟机器人见个面啊012---Hey, uh, when do I get to meet the robot?
抱歉  那就现在吧  他也在这儿012---I'm sorry, why don't we do that right now? He's right here.
好的  乔伊崔比亚尼   这位012---Okay. Joey Tribbiani, this is--
哇  真是栩栩如生012---Wow! He's so lifelike.
了不起012---Unbelievable.
这位是韦恩   机器人"吉事"的发明者和操作者012---This is Wayne, the man who created and operates C.H.E.E.S.E.
韦恩   你好012---How do you do there, buddy?
你们两个慢慢聊   好的012---I'll let you two guys get acquainted, huh? Okay.
刚才很抱歉012---Sorry about that.
吉事呢  吉事就在这里012---Uh, so where's C.H.E.E.S.E.? C.H.E.E.S.E. is right here.
麦克  幸会012---Nice to meet you, Mac.
它是半成品吧  不是  怎么了012---This is the temporary robot, right? No. Why?
我以为它会改造得更酷012---Well, I just thought it was gonna be a really cool robot. y'know? 
像魔鬼终结者  或者刚才的你012---Like the Terminator, or, uh, when I first saw you.
我花了两年时间研发这个机器人   它非常先进012---I spent two years developing this machine. It's absolutely state of the art.
抱歉  只是它看起来其貌不扬012---I'm sorry. it just—I don't know it doesn't really look like it can do anything.
它能揍你012---It can do this.
嘿  哇哦012---Hey-Oh, ha, ha.
这是我爸  保罗史提芬斯  爸  这是罗斯盖勒012---This is my father, Paul Stevens. Dad, this is Ross Geller.
保罗  幸会012---It's great to meet you, Paul.
我比较喜欢伊丽莎白的男友  叫我史提芬斯先生012---I prefer that Liz's boyfriends to address me as Mr. Stevens.
没问题  史提芬斯先生012---Uh, Of course, of course. Mr. Stevens.
罗斯012---Good. So, Ross...
你有什么毛病嘛012---...what's your problem?
什么012---Excuse me?
为什么不交年龄相近的女友012---Why can't you get a girlfriend your own age?
这个  真好笑012---Heh. It's funny...
这个  不好笑012---Um, it's not funny.
我不喜欢你跟我女儿交往  罗斯012---I don't like you going out with my daughter, Ross.
嗯  我看得出来012---Okay, urn, I can see that.
但你要是给我机会  我一定能改变你的看法012---But I think if you give me, urn, one chance, I can change your mind.
好啊   什么012---Okay. What?
好  我给你机会改变我的看法012---Okay. I'll give you one chance to change my mind.
计时1分钟012---You've got one minute.
爸爸   好吧012---Daddy. Fine.
2分钟   开始012---Two minutes. Go.
l分50秒012---A minute and 50 seconds.
好012---Okay, um--
告诉你  我以前没做过这种事012---I want you to know, I have never done anything like this before.
我是说  我跟别人交往过012---I mean, I've been in, urn, relationships in general.
但没跟学生做过  不  我的意思012---But I've never done it with a student. I mean, not...
不是那档子事   我们也没做过012---Not "it." We haven't done "it."
当然我们做过一些事012---Uh-We, I mean-I mean, we've done stuff...
好吧   笑话  讲个笑话轻松一下012---Okay. Okay. A joke. A joke. Lighten the mood.
两个男人走进酒吧   一个是爱尔兰人012---Um, two guys go into a bar. One of them is Irish.
我是爱尔兰人  结果爱尔兰人赢了012---I'm Irish. And the Irish guy wins the joke.
罗斯  罗斯012---Ross? Ross!
居然会在这里遇见你  天哪  谢天谢地012---How crazy that we would run into you. Oh, my God! Thank you.
嗯012---Um, uh--
史提芬斯先生  他们是我的朋友012---Mr. Stevens, I'd like you to meet my friends.
菲比  摩妮卡和钱德012---This is Phoebe, Monica, and Chandler.
你是伊丽莎白的父亲   难怪她有一种012---So you're Elizabeth's father, huh? I can see now where she gets her...
粗犷的美012---...rugged handsomeness.
你老婆可健在012---Is there a Mrs. Stevens?
你老公还没死012---There's a Mr. Bing!
不幸啊  丽莎出生后不久  她妈妈就过世了012---No, unfortunately, Lizzie's mom passed away shortly after she was born.
我一手把她带大012---I raised her by myself. Oh...
我常碰上这种反应012---I get that a lot.
好  大家都坐吧012---Okay, urn, why don't we all take a seat, you know? Heh.
我去帮大家叫些咖啡012---And, uh, I'll get us all some, uh, coffees.
好  请诸位012---Yeah, why don't you-Ahem. Uh...
畅所欲言012---And you guys can talk about whatever you want.
想到什么就聊什么012---Whatever pops into your head.
这时候在这里遇见罗斯  真怪啊012---It is so strange seeing Ross here, this time of day...
通常他都要在儿童医院012---...because usually he's at the children's hospital.
对   都没有约会012---Yeah. But not looking for dates.
摩妮卡是罗斯的妹妹012---So, um, Monica is Ross' sister.
他是个了不起的大哥012---He's a great brother!
我也有个妹妹012---I had a sister. Oh.
她过世了   哦012---She passed away. Oh...
你们不用每次都表示同情012---You don't have to do that every time.
不过  罗斯人真的很好  我们是大学室友012---But, uh, Ross is a great guy. I was roommates with him in college.
相当的有趣012---Funny story, heh, ha, ha...
你的大学室友一定死了  对吧012---Your roommate in college died, didn't he?
他算是半死不活  对012---A part of him did, yes.
来吧   保罗  伊丽莎白012---Okay! Here we are, Paul, Elizabeth.
希望你们能找到愉快的话题012---I hope you guys were finding something to talk about.
我们正在愉快   抱歉  我来晚了012---Yes. We were just-Sorry I'm late.
不过我已经准备好了  帮你美言几句012---But I am ready, ready to talk you up. Heh.
丽莎的爸爸什么时候来   我已经到了012---When does Liz's father get here? I'm already here.
罗斯人最好了012---Oh, Ross is so great.
甜心  你买了印着小女生的这种  不是说好买印着婴儿的那种吗012---Honey, you got the kind with the little girl. You said we'd get the kind with the baby.
你说的那个婴儿的让你害怕   不  是小女生的才恐怖012---You said the baby creeps you out. No, The little girl creeps me out.
你是说婴儿的  婴儿的为什么会让我害怕012---You said the baby. Why would the baby creep me out?
那小女生有什么好怕的012---Why would the little girl creep you out?
抱歉  你们讲慢点好吗012---I'm sorry. Can you please talk a little slower.
你要写进书里  对  这是探讨两性关系的书012---This is going in your book? Yeah, It's about relationships.
尔虞我诈  各种禁忌012---You know, the traps, the pitfalls, what not to do.
接着说   太精彩了  什么012---Keep going. This stuffs great. What?
再说一遍012---Excuse me.
还有就是  真爱无敌012---And how none of it matters when the people really love each other.
还有   人人都喜欢听好话012---And how people will believe anything you tell them as long as it's a compliment.
喔   嗨   嗨012---Oh, hi! Hi. Hi. Hi.
我的钥匙掉在这里什么地方了  那赶快找啊012---I left my keys here somewhere. Oh, well, let's look for them.
在这里  嘿012---Under here-Oh, hey!
嘿  是这串吗012---Hey! Are these them?
不是012---No.
好吧012---All right. Oh.
是这串  太好了012---Here they are. Good.
多谢帮忙   等等012---Thanks for your help. Wait! Sorry!
保罗先生   叫我保罗就好012---Mr. Paul? Just call me Paul.
保罗  我只是想说012---Paul. Um, I just wanted you to know that...
罗斯人真的很好012---...you know, Ross really is a great guy.
不如你跟他交往   省得我宰了他012---Maybe you could date him then. it would save me the trouble of killing him.
你没事吧012---Are you okay?
你不像是个有20岁女儿的人012---You just don't look old enough to have a 20-year-old daughter.
我们生她的时候很年轻012---Well, we were very young when we had her.
我们  对啊   通常一男一女才能生孩子啊012---Ah. We? Yeah, it usually takes two people to...
当然是  两个人才能生孩子  我知道012---Oh, no! Yes! Of course. I know that.
我是问  现在是"我们"   还是只剩下你单身012---What I meant was are you still "we" or are you just you?
只有我  单身012---I'm just me. Yeah.
丽莎出生没多久   我老婆就死了012---My wife died shortly after Lizzie was born.
喔012---Oh.
你一手把她带大  对  没错012---So you raised her all on your own? Yes, I did.
哦012---Oh...
嘿   嘿012---Hey. Hey.
第一天顺利吗   还不错012---How was your first day? Great.
只是机器人有点闹别扭012---Except I got a little attitude from the robot.
该死的机器人   它们本该是人类忠实的仆人012---Damn those robots. They're supposed to be our faithful servants!
也不是机器人的问题   是操纵他的家伙012---It wasn't the robot, it was the guy who controls him.
他不喜欢我   我正要去拿三明治012---He doesn't like me. He had C.H.E.E.S.E. knock over the sandwich table...
他却操纵吉事  打翻了餐桌012---...right when I was reaching for one. Ugh.
你为啥不解雇了他012---Why don't you get him fired?
搞不好我会  我也不想这样  但我是个明星012---I may have to. I hate to do it. But I'm the star, you know?
总不能老捡地上的三明治来吃吧012---There's a limit to how many sandwiches I can eat off the floor.
抱歉012---Excuse me.
乔伊崔比亚尼012---Joey Tribbiani.
小子  总算找到你了  我帮你联系了一个试镜012---Joe! I'm glad I found you! I got an audition for you.
哇   不过这事还没公开012---Wow. The thing is, it's kind of on the q.t.
那个演员不知道   他可能会被换掉012---The actor who has the part doesn't know he might be fired.
是一部连续剧的主角012---It's the lead in a series.
麦克与吉事012---Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.
我就是《麦克与吉事》的主角012---I'm the lead in Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.
哦012---Uh-oh.
乔伊012---Joey?
嗨  罗斯012---Hi, Ross.
我只想让他更喜欢你012---I was just getting him to like you.
乔伊012---Joey?
乔伊  嘿  罗斯012---Joey! Hey, Ross.
罗斯  乔伊不在012---Ross, Joey is not here.
那好   我就在这儿等等他012---Okay, I'll just wait for him in here!
罗斯   没关系   你可以出来012---Ross, it's okay. You can come out.
罗斯  没关系  是我啊012---Yeah, Ross. It's okay. It's me...
史提芬斯先生012---...Mr. Stevens.
哦  天哪   我刚才没看见你012---Oh, I didn't... Oh, my gosh. I didn't even see you.
你肯定看见了  你走进来  表情古怪  然后就跑进了卧房012---Sure you did. You came in, got all awkward and ran to the bedroom.
还一直喊   "乔伊  乔伊"012---You were shouting, "Joey, Joey!"
再见  瑞秋  再见012---Bye, Rachel. Bye.
我会再打给你  好  再见012---I'll call you later. Okay. See you!
罗斯  再见012---Bye, Ross. Ah, hoo. Ha, ha.
你在   你怎么了  你在怎么012---What-what-what the—how da-how did-what the-how did-what?!
他的钥匙掉了  到处在找012---Well, You know, he lost his keys. So he was looking for them.
在你的嘴里找012---In your mouth?
不012---No.
在楼下找  我们聊了2小时012---Downstairs. And we got to talking...
我很喜欢他  就请他上来喝杯咖啡012---...for two hours. I really liked him. I invited him for a cup of coffee.
你们就在咖啡厅里012---You were at the coffee house!
罗斯  就算我亲了他  这有什么大不了的012---Ross, what's the big deal? So I kissed the guy.
他是我女朋友的爸爸   这样子很怪012---He's my girlfriend's father. Okay? It's weird!
你还跟我妹约会呢   那不一样012---You dated my sister. That was different!
什么  有什么不一样  我觉得怪012---What? Why? This is weird for me!
罗斯  听好  这样对你有好处012---Ross, look. look this is good for you, okay?
承认吧  目前保罗一点也不喜欢你012---Let's face it. So far the guy's not loving you.
但我可以改变他的看法   我有门路012---But I can turn that around. I've got the inside track.
我们可以一起出去吃饭   我替你美言012---We could all go out to dinner. y'know? And I could talk you up.
况且他是个超有名的律师012---Plus the guy is a very, very successful lawyer.
很重要吗   绝对重要012---How is that important? Oh, it's important.
很明显  能扮演麦克的人多如牛毛012---Apparently, there's a million guys out there that can play Mac ...
机器人只有一个012---...and there's only one robot.
能控制他的人更是独一无二   没想到他竟有生杀大权012---And this one guy who controls it. I didn't know he could get me fired.
我该怎么办  乔伊012---What am I gonna do? Well, Joey.
你是一个魅力男012---You're a pretty charming guy.
谢了  但我现在面临困难012---Thanks. But I have a problem to deal with.
宝贝  你得征服那个操作员012---No, sweetie. You've got to win over the guy who controls C.H.E.E.S.E.
还得用力拍机器人的马屁012---Go back there and kiss some serious robot ass!
好主意012---That's not a bad idea!
既然明天要施展魅力  今天就不跟你们这伙人浪费了012---If I have to turn on the charm tomorrow, I'm not wasting any of it on you guys.
不过菲比  我为你留了一点012---Oh, actually I got a little bit saved for you, Pheebs.
你觉得  乔伊比我有魅力012---So do you think, uh, Joey is more charming than me'?
对   不然我怎么会跟他睡觉012---Yeah. That's why I'm sleeping with him on the side.
你想得美012---Yeah, you wish.
"你想得美"   菲比  别再写我们了012---"You wish." Phoebe, stop writing about us.
我没写你们   我写别人呢012---I'm not writing about you. I'm writing about other people.
谁  摩莎和钱特012---Who? Marsha and Chester.
好吧  写吧  我也要写菲莉丝的故事012---Okay, fine. Fine. Then you know what? I will just write about Phyllis.
哼   嗯012---Hmm. Huh.
"菲莉丝坐在椅子上"  我知道你想干嘛012---"Phyllis is sitting in the chair." I see what you're doing.
"菲莉丝知道我想干嘛"012---"Phyllis sees what I'm doing." Oh, ho.
哇  我终于自食恶果了012---Ooh, I have tasted my own medicine and it is bitter.
早  嘿012---Morning! Hey!
我最欣赏的天才和我的机器人搭档  好吗012---How's my favorite genius and his robot buddy?
不许碰它  好  行了012---Don't touch him! Okay. All right. Um...
韦恩  你老实说  我一直听说我会被换掉012---Wayne, level with me. Okay? I keep hearing all these rumors that I might get fired.
他们还找人来试我这个角色012---Okay, they even have actors coming in to read for my part.
拜托啦   再给我一次机会012---Come on, man. You gotta give me a second chance.
我爱死这个小家伙了012---I love this little guy-Aah.
好吧  难怪你从不让我碰他  拿去吧012---Okay. That's why you didn't want me to touch him, right? There you go.
白痴  真是的012---Stupid! I can't believe this! God.
嘿  你好吗012---Hey, how are you doing?
看样子我是被放鸽子了012---So it seemed that my prom date had stood me up.
罗斯还大方的提议要带我去012---So Ross selflessly offered to take me.
好动听的故事啊012---What a nice story. Heh.
罗斯上大学时012---So Ross was in college...
想趁虚而入  就带一名少女参加高中舞会012---...and decided to jump at the chance to take a young girl to her prom.
哇  我倒从没从这个角度想过这事012---Wow. I definitely did not see that one backfiring.
我去下洗手间   你慢慢上012---I'm gonna go to the bathroom. Yeah. Take your time.
其实我读大一   她高中毕业   所以倒也不是差很多012---Just so you know, I was a freshman and she was a senior. So it wasn't as bad as--
罗斯  听着  我知道我一直在找你麻烦012---Ross, look. I know I've been giving you a lot of jabs.
因为我爱女心切012---It's partly because I'm very protective of Lizzie...
而且情不自禁012---...and partly because well, they just keep coming to me.
但我得承认  丽莎一直都在夸你012---But I have to admit that after all the wonderful things Lizzie has told me...
瑞秋又说了那么那么多故事012---and the many, many, many stories that Rachel has told me...
看来012---that, well
你也不是012---you're not
那么坏012---all bad.
"压根儿就不坏"012---"Not all bad."
很抱歉之前对你那么苛刻   你得体谅我012---And anyhow, I'm sorry I was so harsh before, But you have to understand.
丽莎在我眼里还是个12岁的小女孩012---I still look at Lizzie like she's a 12-year-old girl.
我懂  我也有同感012---You know, I know what you mean. I do that, too.
你说什么  不  我不是把她当成12岁小女孩012---I beg your pardon? No! No! Not—I don't mean I-I see her as a 12-year-old girl.
我是说  我有个6岁大的儿子  在我眼里就还当是个小婴儿012---I mean, I have a son who's, um, 6, and I still think of him as a baby.
你有儿子  对   我和前妻012---You have a son? Yeah. My ex-wife and I...
共有孩子的监护权012---...uh, share custody of Ben. And, uh--
还有  卡萝和我早已达成共识012---Just so you know, Carol and I are on excellent terms...
相信你和你太太也是012---...as I'm sure you are with your wife.
抱歉012---Oh! I'm sorry.
真是的012---It's unbelievable!
没事   我只是没意识到你结过婚012---Don't worry about it, I just didn't realize you were married.
我们是结过婚   但那只是012---Oh, we were. But that was just a...
只是酒后胡闹罢了012---I mean, that was just a big drunken mistake.

我如果有提到6点012---The only way that I said 6:00...
应该是说  "我们约7点   不要约6点"012---...would be if I said the sentence, "Let's meet at 7:00, not at 6:00."

他只是没告诉我012---He just didn't tell me.
看样子我还得上趟洗手间012---Maybe I have to pee again.
真有意思012---Well, this is fun.
罗斯012---So Ross...

没关系  瑞秋  我们现在不喜欢罗斯了012---That's okay, Rach. We're not liking Ross right now.
