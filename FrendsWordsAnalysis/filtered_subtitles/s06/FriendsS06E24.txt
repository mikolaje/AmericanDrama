噢  是理查012---Oh, that's Richard.
天哪  也许他看不见我们  理查012---Oh God, Maybe he won't see us. Richard!
摩妮卡  钱德   嘿012---Monica. Chandler. Hey.
我不知道我为什么要抱你012---I don't know why I did that.
见到你真好  彼此彼此  你把头发留长了012---It's good to see you. You too. You let your hair grow.
啊对  没什么  你一直希望我留长的012---Yeah. Oh, that's right, you always wanted me to.
你又开始留胡子了012---I see your mustache is back.
我的鼻子感到寂寞012---Well, my nose got lonely.
你就没留胡子  很好012---And you don't have a mustache, which is good. Ha, ha.
我是钱德  我一感到不自在就想开玩笑012---I'm Chandler. I make jokes when I'm uncomfortable.
抱歉  丽莎  摩妮卡  钱德  我们交往过012---I'm sorry. Lisa, Monica, Chandler. We used to date.

如果你不介意  这一桌也是空的012---If you prefer, this table's available.
一起坐应该不错012---That might be fun.
你在想什么012---What were you thinking?
我不知道这是个拍卖会012---I didn't know it was an auction.
我以为是猜一猜价格012---I figured I'd take a guess.
就可以帮助慈善团体  免费得游艇012---Help a charity. Free boat!
为什么慈善组织会提供免费游艇012---Why would a charity give away a free boat?
我哪知道   做慈善吧012---I don't know. Charity? Oh!
那你就买下这该死的船吧012---Well, just buy the damn boat.
菲比  你喝够了吧012---Phoebe, don't you think you've had enough to drink?
我只是在救助儿童012---I'm just helping the kids.
你喝酒怎么能救助儿童012---How is you drinking helping the kids?
我喝得越多  孩子们喝的就越少012---Because the more I drink, the less there is for the kids to drink.
崔比亚尼先生   你的慷慨解囊012---Mr. Tribbiani. Your contribution brings us...
让兴建青少年活动中心的事大有进展012---...a big step closer to building the youth center.
我只是很好奇  那艘船值多少012---Just out of curiosity, how much is that boat worth?
差不多是1万9012---I think it was valued at 19,000.
我猜得蛮准的012---Hey, I was pretty close.
有个坏消息012---Uh, so, bad news.
我不能买那艘船  我没有那么多钱012---Um, I can't buy the boat. I don't have any money.
乔伊  你真幽默012---Joey! Joey, good one!
你真会演  好012---Good! Very good!
好吧  我要走人了  你不能走  乔伊012---So uh listen, I think I'm gonna take off now. Hey! You can't leave, Joey!
你答应了要买船的  这是个协议012---You agreed to buy that boat. all right! It is a contract.
而且你走了  我的主管会宰了我012---Plus, if you leave, my boss is gonna kill me.
那怎么办  瑞秋  我没那么多钱012---Well, what am I gonna do, Rach? I don't have that kind of money.
我知道  好012---I know. Okay, okay, okay, okay.
好  这样吧012---This is what we'll do.
我们去找出价第二高的人  然后让他们去买012---We'll go to the next highest bidder, and we'll let them buy it.
你只要出差价就行了012---Then you're just gonna pay the difference.
好吧012---0Kay.
我不明白这些小孩要活动中心干嘛012---Look, I don't know why the kids need a youth center anyway.Y'know?
放了学跟我一样看电视  像我现在也蛮好的012---They should just watch TV after school like I did. And I turned out fine.
但是不优秀012---Not great.
所以  我们就躲在洗手间里012---And so, we're hiding in the bathroom...
然后我溜了出来  但摩妮卡还没出来  她父母就进去了012---And-and then I sneak out. But before Monica can, her parents come in.
于是我躲到浴帘后面  你知道吗012---So I hide in the shower, next thing you know...
他们就在浴室地板上做起来了012---...they're going at it right on the bathroom floor.
我的天哪012---Oh, my God!
我有一个  我有一个012---I got a good one. I got a good one.
我有一次撞见我父母  跟同一个男人做爱012---I once walked in on both my parents making love to the same guy.
很高兴再见到你们   我想敬酒012---It's so great seeing you guys again. I'd like to make a toast.
正如一位诗人所说  "在友谊的甜蜜里012---Uh, as a poet once said, "In the sweetness of friendship...
让我们尽情欢笑   分享欢乐吧012---...let there be laughter and sharing of pleasures for...
人心正是从每一件小事中012---...in the dew of little things...
获得朝气  使我们的心灵充满活力"012---...the heart finds its morning and is refreshed."
哦012---Aw.
什么012---What?
天哪  你们两个012---Oh, my God! You guys!
在你开口之前  我们有事要说  猜猜我们吃饭时遇见谁了012---Before you say anything, have we got a story for you. Guess who we bumped into at dinner!
谁  理查012---Who? Richard!
哦  哦012---Oh. Oh.
我以为你要和伊丽莎白约会012---I thought you were going out with Elizabeth.
本来是的   不过当时她忙着打水仗012---Yeah, I was but uh, she was a little busy with a water balloon fight.
听着  罗斯  有时大人也不会兑现他们的承诺012---Oh Ross, sometimes grownups have commitments they just can't get out of.
也许她对我是年轻了点012---Maybe she is too young for me.
当我看到她跟朋友这么打闹   我觉得我就像个保姆012---When I was over there and she was running around with her friends, I felt like I was a babysitter.
我终于开始明白你们说的话了   我不知道该怎么办012---I finally see what you were talking about. I don't know what to do.
你可以衡量一下这段感情的利弊012---Why don't you just weigh the good stuff about the relationship against the bad stuff.
就是我该先做什么  衡量一下012---That's what I did when I first started weighing stuff.
好吧   坏的方面   我比她大12岁012---Okay, urn, bad stuff. Well, I'm- I'm 12 years older than she is.
学校发现   会开除你012---If the school finds out you're fired.
她要离开3个月  去参加夏令营012---She's leaving for three months. For camp.
然后   好的方面012---Okay, good stuff. Um...
她很可爱  很漂亮012---Well, she's sweet and pretty and...
罗斯  唯一的问题是问你自己  你看得见未来吗012---Look Ross, the only question you need to ask is, do you see a future?
你能想像跟她结婚吗012---Do you see yourself marrying her?
天哪  你做了  你已经娶她了  对不对012---My God. You did it already. You married her, didn't you?
没有啦  我并没有  只是012---No! No! I didn't do that. It's just...
好吧  老实说  我觉得我们没什么未来012---Okay, Honestly, no, I don't, I don't see a big future with her.
这就是你的答案了012---Okay, I think that's your answer.
我得告诉她   我最恨这一步了012---I gotta talk to her. I hate this part.
忘了伊丽莎白  你要是不小心012---Forget Elizabeth. I mean if you're not careful...
今年可能会结不到婚012---...you may not get married at all this year.
瑞秋  瑞秋012---Rash , Rash.
