既然乔伊人这么好  也许我们可以约个会012---And since Joey seems like such a nice guy, maybe we could go on a date sometime?
他不太习惯女人这么主动012---Well, he's not used to women being so forward with him...
不过我问过他了  他说同意了012---...but uh, I good check with him—He says it's okay.
太好了  谢谢  再见012---Great. Thanks. Bye-bye.

真好  我的约会次数又要破纪录了012---This is great. I'm getting more dates than ever.

对啊  乔伊  好恶心啊012---Yeah，Joey, that is so gross.
要不要来一块免费司康012---Hmm. How about a scone on the house, baby?
我是美女012---I'm pretty.
老友记  第六季  第13集  瑞秋的妹妹012---Friends  S06E13  The One With Rachel's Sister
有人有口香糖吗   我有012---Hey, does anyone have any gum? Oh, I do.
对不起  拿一下012---Here. Sorry.
好像是012---Oh, you know what?

我记得我有   算了  不用了012---I know it's in here somewhere. You know what? I'm good. I'm good.
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
你怎么回来了  不是在上班吗012---What are you doing here? Shouldn't you be at work?
他们叫我回家  说什么感冒不能做菜012---They sent me home. They said I can't work if I'm sick.
这样012---Aw.
真可怜  我没有感冒012---I'm so sorry that you're sick. I'm not sick.
我才不会感冒012---I don't get sick.
软弱和娘娘腔的人才会感冒012---Getting sick is for weaklings. It's for pansies.
没有人觉得你娘娘腔012---Honey, no one thinks that you're a pansy.
但我们觉得你需要面纸012---But we do think that you need a tissue.
我已经3年多没感冒了012---I have not been sick in over three years.
我帮你拿几张面纸  我不需要面纸  我很好...哪012---I'm gonna grab you some tissue. I don't need a tissue. I'm fine.
好的后面还加个哪   就不好哪012---When you put a D at the end of "fine," you're not fine.
我很好…哪012---I'm fine.
我很好…哪012---I'm fine.

嗨  那是菲比  那是乔伊012---Hi. And that's Phoebe, and that's Joey.
你好吗  不准012---Hey. How you doing? Don't.
你怎么来了012---Honey, what are you doing here? Oh.
这是哪个妹妹012---Which sister is this?
被宠坏的还是咬她的那一位012---Is this the spoiled one or the one that bit her?
老爸断了我的财源  我知道了012---Daddy cut me off. Never mind, I got it.
你知道我怎么说012---And you know what I said to him?
我说 "我要请一个律师  把你的钱都告过来012---I said, "I'm gonna hire a lawyer, and I'm gonna sue  you and take all your money...
然后断了你的财源"012---...and then I'm gonna cut you off."
那他怎么说  他说不帮我付律师费012---What did he say? He said he wouldn't pay for my lawyer.
还叫我来跟他唯一自豪的女儿012---Then he told me to come  here and learn about the value of money...
学学金钱的价值012---...from the one daughter he's actually proud off.
你们听到了吗   我爸以我为荣   我爸以我为荣012---Did you hear that? My dad's proud of me. My dad's proud of me. Ha, ha.
瑞秋  好  抱歉012---Rash'? Oh, yeah, sorry.
爸为什么不给你钱012---Hey, honey, so, what did you do that made Dad cut you off?
我买了一艘船   你买了一艘船012---Okay, I bought a boat. You bought a boat?
不是我要的  是要送一个朋友的012---Yeah, but it wasn't for me, it was for a friend.
男生们  我们跟这个可怜的妹妹交个朋友吧012---Boy, did we make friends with the wrong sister.
吉儿  我觉得对你  这是一次最好的教训012---Jill, honey, I think this is the best thing that could've ever happened to you.
反正你也得独立012---You've needed to get out on your own anyway.
我刚开始独立时  也很害怕012---And you know, when I did it, at first I was scared...
结果现在呢012---...but then look at me now.
我是唯一让老爸骄傲的女儿012---I am the only daughter that Dad is proud of.
你现在要做的是找一份工作012---Okay, well, this is what you're gonna do. You're gonna get a job.
找一间公寓  我会帮你012---You're gonna get an apartment. And I'll help you.
你可以跟我们住  对吧  菲比  可以吧012---You can stay with us. Right? Phoebe，She can stay with us?
当然可以  太好了012---Of course, yeah. Oh, that's so great.
好吧  那我就来独立独立  真不知道该怎么感谢你们012---Okay, I'm really gonna do this. I don't know how to thank you guys.
我喜欢汽车012---Aw. I like cars.
你还要用吗  不要了012---You all finished here? Yes.
太好了012---Great.
早上的小费出来了012---Okay, here are the tips for this morning. Mm.
珍50  我50  乔伊欠8块钱012---Jen gets 50, 5O for me, and Joey owes $8.
什么  因为你到处免费送吃的012---What? For all the free food you gave away.
既然是送的  为什么跟我要钱012---Well, if it's free food, how come you're charging me for it'?
我们只免费招待寿星012---We don't give anything away unless it's someone's birthday.
那模特儿比赛第三名呢012---Oh. What if they came in third in a modeling contest?
不行  抱歉012---No. Oh. Sorry.
我今天好惨  这些袋子好重012---I just had the hardest day. Some of these are so heavy.
吉儿  你怎么有钱了  你爸不是把信用卡都收走了吗012---Jill, how did you pay for all this? I thought your dad took your credit card.
拜托   我15岁就会背卡号了012---Oh, please, I memorized those numbers when I was 15.
你们看我买的这些 "独立"行头012---But look at all the cool make-it-on-my-own stuff I got.
这是 "请雇用我" 毛衣012---This is my "Please hire me" sweater.
这是  "你不想把房子租我吗" 裤子012---And these are my "Don't you want to rent me this apartment?" pants.
叫你爸付你的置装费不算独立012---I don't think charging clothes to your dad qualifies as making it on your own.
大科学家就是这么死板012---Oh, Mr. Scientist has to get all technical.
瑞秋真的也不会赞成的012---I don't think Rachel's gonna think it's a good idea.
谁封她当女王了  我超想当女王的012---So who made her queen of the world? I would love that job.
怎么样啊  嘿012---Hey. What's going on? Hey.
吉儿012---Jill.
你跑去逛街吗012---Did you shop?
没有012---No.
是他们012---They did.
对  我们跑去逛街  对  我们跑去逛街012---Yeah, we went shopping. Yeah, we went shopping. Yeah.
你们跑去逛街012---You went shopping?
然后大包小包提回来  在吉儿面前炫耀012---Then you came in here and paraded it right under Jill's nose...
你们明知她想过节俭的生活012---...when you know she's trying to quit.
你们两个家伙  真差劲012---Wow. You guys, that's terrible.
抱歉  吉儿  对不起  吉儿012---Sorry, Jill. Sorry, Jill.
没关系012---It's okay.
你们买了什么  我买了  谢谢012---So, what did you get? Oh, well, all right. I got-Thank you.
我买了这件   "我要工作"毛衣012---I got, um, this, you know, "I want a job" sweater.
哇哦012---Oh.
还买了这条公寓裤012---And then I got, uh... These are apartment pants.
公寓裤012---Apartment pants?
对  你没听说过吗012---Yeah, you've never heard of them?
当然听过012---No, of course. Of course I've heard of them.
罗斯  那你呢012---Ross, what did you get? Huh?
我买了这个012---I got this...
这个012---This.
喀什米尔  对012---A pashmina? Yeah.
我爱死它了012---Oh, I love these babies.
是吗012---Really? Mm-hm.
罗斯  喀什米尔是什么012---Ross, what's a pashmina?
一种小毯子012---It's a rug.
吉儿012---Jill?
瑞秋  对不起012---I'm sorry, Rachel.
拜托  你真以为我会上当012---Oh, come on, you really think that's gonna work on me?
泪眼攻势是我发明的012---I invented that.
也对  但我真的很抱歉012---Oh, right. But I am sorry.
算了   走一次回头路还算好012---All right, it's okay. One little setback is okay.
就是别再犯了  好吗  好012---But don't let it happen again, all right? Okay.
既然这是老爸付的钱  我应该全都没收012---Now, since Daddy paid for all this stuff, I should take it all away.
不过我没收披肩就好012---But I'm just gonna take the pashmina.
还有那条裤子012---And the pants.
还是统统没收好了  这样你才能得到教训012---You know what? I'm just gonna take it all, because that way, you'll learn the lesson.
好了012---All right
我有事要忙  晚餐见012---I'm gonna run a couple of errands, and I will see you at dinner.
都被她拿走了012---She took all my stuff.
没错   除了这个蓝色小袋子012---Yeah. Everything but the little blue one.
这一样最棒了012---That's the best one.
天哪  太谢谢你  这个嘛012---Oh, my God. Thank you so much. Oh. Well, hey.
天哪  你好差劲   喀什米尔怎么会是小毯子012---Oh, my gosh, that was so lame. Like a pashmina could be a rug.
那你呢012---Oh, yeah? Well, how about you with the:
"对不起"  闭嘴  我哪有那么恶心012---"I'm sorry." Shut up. I wasn't like that at all.
我那个公寓裤呢012---What about what I said, you know, about the apartment pants?
够蠢吧012---How dumb was I?
你高中时有这么可爱吗   别闹了012---Were you this cute in high school? Oh, stop.
你才别闹了   你才别闹了012---No, you stop. No, you stop.
你别闹了012---You stop.
好   我坐中间   你们都别闹了012---Okay-okay, why don't I sit here and then you'll both stop it?
你想做什么  我们来疯一下012---Okay, so, what do you wanna do? Let's do something crazy.
我知道  我们来  多休息多喝水012---I know, let's rest and drink lots of fluids.
好  我休息012---Okay, I'll rest.
不过如果我要上床  你也得跟我来012---But, you know, if I'm going to bed, then you're coming with me.
我本来很难说不  但是你鼻水流不停012---See, that would be impossible to resist if you weren't all drippy here.
你是说你不想要我吗012---Are you saying that you don't wanna get with this?
你最好连健康时都不要像这样012---Yeah, I don't think you should say that even when you're healthy.
来嘛012---Oh. Come on.
我不是针对你012---Don't take this personally, okay?
我就是没办法跟病人上床012---It's just that I just can't have sex with a sick person.
我也是  钱德012---I'm with you, Chandler.
我也不跟病人上床   那样好恶心012---I can't have sex with a sick person either. That's disgusting.
但是我没病   我可以证明给你看012---But I'm not sick. Let me prove it to you.
我们身强体壮  青春正盛012---We are two healthy people in the pribe of libe.
我就是想  继续012---See, that's the thing. I would like to stay in...
身强体壮012---...the prime of mwha-ah-libe.
嘿012---Hey.
嘿  怎么样啊012---Hey. What's up?
有件事或许你应该知道012---Um, I think there's something you should maybe know.
最好不是公寓裤的事012---Well, it’d better not be about the apartment pants...
因为我的上司爱死这个构想了012---...because I just pitched the idea to my boss at Ralph Lauren, and she loved it.
不  不是  我刚刚012---No, no. It's just, I was, um...
你走了后  我跟罗斯和吉儿在一起012---I was with Ross and Jill after you left...
我相当确定  他们之间有火花012---...and I'm pretty sure I saw a little spark between them.
什么  或许没事012---What? Yeah, I mean, it's probably nothing.
我只是想提醒你  他们或许有什么012---But I just wanted to warn you that there might be something there.
罗斯跟吉儿  对012---With Ross and Jill? Yeah.
罗斯和我妹妹012---With Ross and my sister?
嗯012---Yeah.
我妹吉儿和我的前男友罗斯012---With my sister Jill and my ex-boyfriend Ross?
嗯012---Yeah.
不可能的  那好吧012---Oh, there is no way. Okay, then.
我的天哪   我真不敢相信012---Oh, my God. I cannot believe that.
我不是反对罗斯交女朋友  可居然跟我妹012---I don't really like it when Ross goes out with anyone, but my sister?
这不是等于乱伦吗012---Isn't that like incest or something?
天哪  而且他们会上床  要是他还娶她呢012---Oh, my God, and they're gonna have sex. Oh, no. What if he marries her too?
太恐怖了  真是太恐怖了012---Oh, this is just terrible. This is just terrible.
而我又不能阻止  罗斯又不是我的012---And I can't stop it. I don't own Ross, you know?
而且吉儿有她的行动自由012---And Jill, she should be able to do whatever it is she wants to do.
我的天哪  罗斯居然要娶我妹012---Oh, my God, I can't believe Ross is marrying my little sister.
这简直012---This is just--
天那  这真是我这一生最悲惨的遭遇012---Oh, my God, this is just the worst thing that could've ever happened to me.
不过公寓裤的事真是太好了012---But great news about the apartment pants, huh?
总共3块85012---That'll be 3.85.
什么意思   昨天你还说我太美可以免费的012---What do you mean? Yesterday you said I was too pretty to pay for stuff!
现在我不能请客   因为经理说我012---It's just I can't, because my manager said that I--

抱歉迟到了  什么事012---Sorry I'm late. What's up?
哦   嘿012---On, hey. Uh...
我只是想问你工作找得怎样012---You know, I just wanted to see if there were any leads on the old job front.
没进展  但我经过三家折扣店都没进去012---Oh. No. But I just walked past three sales and I didn't go in.
我很坚强吧  嗯012---How strong am I? Oh.
太好了012---That is great.
你知道谁不必找工作012---Hey, you know who doesn't have to job-hunt?

所以你知道  你们聊过  你们很投缘  你们要约会吗012---Oh so you know that, you guys talked about that, so you get along, so you think you’re gonna go out?
我跟罗斯约会  当然不会  你哪来的念头012---Me go out with Ross? No. God, no. What would make you think that?
就菲比012---I just, Phoebe...
觉得你们有什么012---...said she, you know, thought she saw something between you guys.
没有  他人是很好  是啊012---No. I mean, he's nice. Yeah.
你想和他做朋友  但不想和他交往012---He's the kind of guy you're friends with but not the kind of guy you date.
你会  你跟他交往过  而我呢012---I mean, he's the kind of guy you date, because you did, but me?
就没什么兴趣012---Hmm, not so much.
没什么兴趣   什么意思012---Oh, not so much? What do you mean?
罗斯有哪里不好吗012---I mean, is there something wrong with Ross?
没有  只不过012---Oh, no, no, no. He's just--
我不知道  他有点书呆子吧012---I don't know. You know, he's just a little bookish.
你觉得他是怪胎  你也有同感012---Are you saying he's a geek? You think so too?
不  罗斯不是怪胎012---No. No. Ross is not a geek.
好  就当他不是我喜欢的类型012---Fine. Then let's just say he's not my type.
什么  你不喜欢帅哥012---What, handsome is not your type?
聪明  好心  吻功一流  难道这些不是你的条件012---Smart, kind, good kisser? What, those things aren't on your list?
罗斯人很好  能跟他在一起是你的福气012---Ross is a great guy. You would be lucky to be with him.
好  既然你这么在意  我就约他012---Well, okay, if it means that much to you, I'll ask him out.
不  不  不   我不是那个意思012---Oh, no, no, no. That's not what I meant. I was just--
你知道吗  瑞秋  你说得对  他对我确实很好012---You know what, Rachel? You're right. You know, he has been really nice to me.
但他不是你的菜012---Yeah, but he's not your type.
或许这是个好事012---But maybe that's a good thing.
我正在做各种不同的尝试012---You know, I'm doing all these different things.
或许也应该跟怪胎约会看看012---Maybe I should just try dating a geek too.
但你也别一下子做太多的尝试012---Yeah, but you don't, you know-You don't wanna try too much too fast.
你记不记得   一下子做太多尝试的012---I mean, you do remember what happened to the little girl...
那个小女孩012---...who tried too much too fast, don't you?

我倒是睡着了012---I was asleep.
不  不  你知道怎么穿才性感   多穿几层012---Oh, no, no, no, honey. You know what's sexy? Layers.
多穿几层才性感012---Layers are sexy.
被子才性感   热水袋更性感012---And blankets are sexy. And, oh, hot water bottles are sexy.
快点  上床啦   我想证明我没生病012---Come on, get into bed. I wanna prove that I'm not sick.
我想让你跟我一样舒服012---I wanna make you feel as good as I feel.

祝你生日快乐012---Happy birthday to you
你出钱  不  今天是她的生日012---You're paying for that. What? No, no, it's her birthday.

但我从来没想过要跟她约会  从来没想012---...but I never would've thought of going out with her. Never.
真的  对啊012---Really? Yeah.
不过既然你都说行  我心想  何不试试012---But after you said it was okay, I figured, why not?
所以  也不算 "从来没想"过012---Oh, so not really "never." Heh.
你真的  比我大方多了012---I have to say, you are a much bigger person than I am.
我们经历过那么多过去  我012---I mean, after all we've been through. I just--
