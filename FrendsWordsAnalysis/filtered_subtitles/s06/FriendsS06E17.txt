嘿  记得我之前不是养过猴子吗012---Hey, remember when I had a monkey?
对  啊012---Yeah. Mm-hm.
对  我在想什么012---Yeah. what, What was I thinking?
小费怎么才20%   我做错什么事了吗012---Hey, so, what's with the 20 percent tip? Did I do something wrong?
20%很大方了  乔伊012---Twenty percent is a pretty generous tip. Joe.
你知道多少更大方吗   50%012---You know what's more generous than that? Fifty percent.
你知道怎样更大方吗   我知道你想说什么了012---You know what's even more generous? I see where you're going.
你干嘛这么贪心  乔伊   好吧   对不起  只是012---What's up with the greed, Joe? All right, look, I'm sorry, you guys.
我得照新的大头照了012---but it's just that I gotta get these new headshots made...
你们知道  那玩意太贵了012---...and they're really expensive, you know.
我只剩下三张了012---I'm down to like three.
其实是两张  有一张的牙齿被我涂黑012---Actually, two, because one of them I kind of blackened in some teeth.
我干吗拍那玩意啊012---Why'd I do that? Ugh.
你就不能做点什么赚些外快吗012---Well, isn't there something you can do to earn a little extra money?
你能不能  我不知道  例如在这里多轮一班012---I mean, can't you pick up, I don't know, an extra shift here?
也许  你们知道我曾经乞讨过012---Or, you know, I used to beg for money.
当然  如果你能表演这个就肯定有用012---Of course, it helps if you've got, you know, a little of this going on.
我现在还会  对012---Wow, I still have it. Ha, ha. Yeah.
等等  你今天不是有试镜  说不定会被选中012---Oh, wait! wait! don't you have an audition today? Yeah. Maybe you'll get that job.
哈哈哈012---Oh, ha-ha-ha.
等等012---Oh, wait a minute.
我以前常参加医学类实验012---I used to get medical experiments down on me all the time.
难怪变成这样012---Ah, finally, an explanation.
不是  我以前常靠这个赚钱  记得吗012---No, I used to get paid for all kinds of medical stuff, remember?
我想想  我不想再捐精子了012---Let's see. Uh... Well, I don't wanna donate sperm again.
那种事在家做比较好012---I really prefer doing that at the home office, you know?
也许医院会要我的血  口水或其它什么的012---Ooh, ooh, maybe they want some of my blood or spit or something, huh?
乔伊  怎样012---Joey. Yeah?
我说过工作时跟朋友聊天会怎样012---What did I tell you about talking to your friends while you're working?
干得好012---Uh, do it?
那个人等咖啡等了10分钟012---That guy's been waiting for his coffee for 1O minutes.
他抱怨了你三次012---He's complained about you three times.
我讲到哪里012---Well, where was I?
老友记  第六季  第17集  鳗鱼力量012---Friends  S06E17  The One With The Unagi
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
你们在忙什么   我们今天去学了防身术012---Hey, what have you been up to? Oh. We went to a self-defense class today.
哇哦012---Wow.
对  踢了一早上男人的胯部   感觉像是在报复你012---Yeah. Kicking a guy in the crotch all morning really takes it out of you.
报复你012---Takes it out of you? Heh.
现在我们谁都能修理了   没错012---No, now we can kick anybody's ass. Yeah.
就上一堂课   我看不见得012---After one class? I don't think so.
什么  想试试我的防身术吗012---What, you wanna see me self-defend myself?
现在就去  假装你是个性侵犯者012---Go over there and pretend you're a sexual predator.
来吧   你敢吗012---Go on, I dare you.
如果你知道会有攻击   当然会保护自己012---Well, Of course you can defend yourself from an attack you know is coming.
这还不够012---That's not enough.
听着  我学了很久的控手道012---Look, I studied kara-tay for a long time.
有个概念你们一定要了解012---And there's a concept you should really be familiar with.
日文叫做 Unagi012---It's what the Japanese call unagi.
那不是一种寿司吗012---Isn't that a kind of sushi?
不是  那是一种概念  是寿司没错  那是鳗鱼012---No, it's a concept. Yeah, it is, it is. It's freshwater eel.
或许是同一个字吧012---All right, maybe it means that too.
我现在好想吃鲑鱼握寿司012---Oh, I would kill for a salmon-skin roll right now.
好  被攻击活该   我才不在乎012---You know what? Fine, get attacked. I don't even care.
好啦   罗斯  对不起  快告诉我们那是什么啊012---Come on, Ross, we're sorry. Please tell us what it is.
Unagi是一种全知的境界012---Unagi is a state of total awareness.
只有达到真正的Unagi012---Okay? Only by achieving true unagi...
才能应付任何可能出现的危险012---...can you be prepared for any danger that may befall you.
你是说有人要偷你的竹席012---In case someone's trying to steal your bamboo sleeping mat...
或鱼壶的时候吗012---...or your kettle of fish?
我是说  应付彼此攻击012---All I'm saying is, it's one thing being prepared...
是一回事012---...for an attack against, like, each other.
应付偷袭又是另外一回事  我不知道012---Whole other story being prepared for an attack, I don't know--
比如意外012---A surprise!
好  这次你们料到了  但不表示你们有Unagi012---All right, you knew that was coming, but that doesn't mean you have unagi.
你知道吗   现在订位子  半小时后就能吃到鳗鱼012---Ooh! Y'know what? if we made reservations, we could have unagi in about a half-hour.
算了012---You know what?
嘿   摩妮卡在吗  不在012---Hey, hey, is Monica here? No.
帮个忙   我不知道该送什么情人节礼物012---Okay, look, I need your help. I don't know what to get for Valentine's Day.
情人节已经过两星期了  反正是我就不会送她日历012---Well, Valentine's Day was two weeks ago, so I wouldn't get her a calendar.
那天她要上班   我们改今晚庆祝012---Heh. She was working on Valentine's Day, so we're celebrating it tonight.
嘿   要不去帮你们一起订个浪漫的SPA嘛012---Oh, hey, why don't you book a day for both of you at one of those romantic spas?
乔伊   这个主意很棒012---Ooh, Joey, that's actually a really good idea.
还要前面开档的性感内裤012---Yeah, and of course, crotchless panties.
这样  对她的男友来说很有吸引力012---Well, as appealing as that does sound to her boyfriend...
也许包括她的哥哥012---and her brother.
我不能那么做  我们说好了  今年要自己做礼物012---I can't do that we promised we'd make each other gifts this year.
我喜欢  真好012---Oh, I love that. You guys.
你要是不会做开档的内裤  你就012---You can't make crotchless panties? You take--
就拿把剪刀给它剪开   好了012---You take a pair of scissors and just cut-Okay, okay, okay.
不过做礼物   听起来好好玩啊012---So making things, that sounds so much fun.
我也这么认为  直到我的眼睛糊到纸黏土012---Yeah, I thought so to until I paper mached one of my eyes shut.
我喜欢纸黏土  你做了什么012---Oh, I love paper mache! What did you make?
我做了＠#%&!012---I made a:
那是什么啊   什么也不是012---What is that? Nothing.
那你要怎么办012---So, what are you gonna do?
你们有没有做个什么能借给我用012---Have you guys made anything that maybe I can take credit for?
我有  我有  我做了袜子兔012---Ooh, I have, I have. I started making these little sock bunnies.
了不起吧012---Oh, for crying out loud.
等等  那是我的袜子012---Hey, wait a minute. That is my sock.
现在它是你的兔兔朋友了012---Now it's your little bunny friend.
好012---0Kay.
这是一个012---This, this actually is a...
嘿   嘿   甜心012---Hey. Hey, honey.
我能不能问你个情人节礼物的事012---Can I ask you a question about the Valentine's Day gifts?
可以啊  全都要自己做吗012---Oh, yeah. Do we have to make the entire thing?
当然  难道你忘了做了012---Yes. Why, did you—you forget to make yours?
当然  当然没有012---Of course, Of course not.
我只是要去做的地方把它拿回来而已012---I just have to, uh, go over to the place where I-I made it and pick-pick it up.
好的   好的012---okay. okay
我好期待   这会是最棒的情人节012---I can't wait. It's gonna be the best Valentine's Day ever.
我居然忘了  要做礼物  要做礼物012---I can't believe it. Make the presents. Make the presents.
什么   要做礼物好兴奋啊012---What? Just so excited to make the presents!
真是的012---Shoot
你好   我是乔伊崔比亚尼012---Hi, I'm Joey Tribbiani.
我诚心诚意  想捐赠一些体液012---And with all do respect, I'd like to donate some fluids.
我们的研究项目已经快要结束了012---We're actually at the end of one of our research cycles...
目前我们不再需要志愿者了012---...so we're not looking for applicants now.
真可惜   我都存了好一阵子了012---That's too bad. I've kind of been saving up.
真的没有我能参加的研究嘛012---Uh, are you sure there's no studies I can participate in?
这是接下来的研究项目表012---Well, here's a schedule of what's coming up.
谢谢012---Ah, thanks.
可是这个已经开始了012---Oh, but this one starts now.
没错  但只限于双胞胎012---That one is available now, but only identical twins are eligible.
那是双胞胎研究   但是有两千块钱012---It's a twin study. But it's $2000.
抱歉012---Sorry. Oh.
那这个怎么样012---Well, how about this one?
"乔伊崔比亚尼对美女接待的影响力实验呢"012---"Testing the Effects of Joey Tribbiani on Attractive Nurse Receptionists."
结果已经出来了  不太理想012---We already got the results back on that one, and they're not good.
那真的不错  很棒对不对012---That was good. Wasn't that a blast?
危险  危险  天啊   罗斯012---Danger! Danger! God, Ross!
你搞什么啊012---What the hell was that?
让你们认识unagi的重要性012---A lesson in the importance of unagi.
你这个变态012---You're a freak.
或许吧012---Perhaps.
现在  我很好奇012---Now, I'm curious.
你们要尖叫到什么时候   才敢要修理我啊012---At what point during those girlish screams would you have begun to kick my ass?
好吧   我们没有准备好012---All right, so we weren't prepared.
抱歉啊  使用这么激烈的方式来传达我的观点012---I'm sorry I had to take such drastic measures to make my point.
不过我  看嘛  是为你们的安全着想012---But, but I—look, I just want you guys to be safe.
危险012---Danger!
嗯哼  Unagi012---Ah, huh? Unagi.
两千块钱好多啊012---Two thousand bucks is a lot of money.
真想有个双胞胎兄弟012---Oh, I wish I had a twin.
到哪里才能找到012---Where could I find someone...
跟我长得一样的人啊012---...who looks exactly like me?
嘿012---Hey.
钱德012---Chandler.
我感觉到是你012---I sensed it was you.
什么012---What?
Unagi012---Unagi.
我永远全知012---I'm always aware.
你知道Unagi是鳗鱼吗012---Okay, are you aware that unagi is an eel?
什么事  我不知道该给摩妮卡做什么礼物012---What's up? I can't figure out what to make Monica.
你可以给她讲个笑话012---Oh. Why don't you make her one of your little jokes?
我快急死了  知道吗012---I'm going crazy, okay?
有没有什么看起来像是自制的东西012---Do you have anything around here that looks homemade?
知道吗   这个她一定会喜欢012---Oh, you know what? She'd love this.
这是阿波罗八号的模型  我六年级做的012---It's an exact replica of Apollo 8. I made it in the sixth grade.
这个也许可以用   我可以说 "你的爱让我飞上月亮"012---Yeah, I guess I could use that. I could say, "Your love sends me to the moon."
对  可是阿波罗八号没有登陆过月球012---Yeah, yeah. Except Apollo 8 didn't actually land on the moon.
不过你可以写012---But you could write, urn:
"你的爱  让我绕月球两圈后顺利返航"012---"Your love lets me orbit the moon twice and return safely."
等等  我不能送这个012---Wait, I can't give this to her.
为什么  因为旁边写着 "罗斯队长"012---Why not? It says "Captain Ross" on the side.
底下写着  "我讨厌摩妮卡"012---And it says "I hate Monica" on the bottom. Oh.
危险  危险012---Danger! Aah!
鲑鱼握寿司012---Ah. Salmon-skin roll.
好012---Okay, okay.

我录了一盒浪漫情歌给你012---But I made you a tape of what I think are all romantic songs.
好棒的礼物012---What a great gift.
有《你今晚的模样》吗012---Is "The Way You Look Tonight" on it?

菲比也做袜子兔012---You know, urn, Phoebe makes sock bunnies.

菲比做的是袜子兔子012---Phoebe, what she makes, that's-They're sock rabbits.
完全不一样   好啦  好啦012---They're completely different. Okay, okay. Okay!
这不是我做的  对不起   我完全忘了今晚012---Okay, I didn't make it. I'm sorry. I totally forgot about tonight...
和做礼物的事了012---...and that we were supposed to make the presents.
没关系  我也  不  不  当然有关系了012---Oh, it's okay. I don't-No, no, it's not okay. It's not.
你那么  你那么的用心012---I mean you were just... You're so incredible!
花那么多心血录情歌给我012---You went through all this time and effort to make this tape for me.
我要补偿你  我一定会的  一定要012---You know, I'm just gonna-I'm gonna make this up to you. I will.
我会下厨房煮你想吃的菜012---I am going to cook you anything you want in here.
进卧室玩你想玩的花样012---And I'm going to do anything you want in there.
我的确花了很多心血012---Well, I did put a lot of thought into the tape.
你还小  不该看的012---You are way too young to have seen that. Oops. Ha, ha.
再1个半月就是你的生日012---Your birthday's in a month and a half.
要是我又忘记准备礼物呢012---What do you say I forget to get you a present for that too?
我百分之百完全原谅你012---You are totally and completely 100 percent forgiven.
那个得拿去洗   没错012---We have got to wash that. Yeah.
你不是看上一件外套012---Hey, do you remember that jacket that you loved so much...
嫌它太贵   你对我已经够好了012---...that you thought was too expensive? You have done enough.
我要一大早跑去买来送你012---Ha, ha. I'm gonna wake up early and get it for you.
你不必买黑色   别买咖啡色012---No, you don't have-Get it in black, not brown.
你的蛋糕好了012---Oop. Your cake is ready. Oop.
俗话说得好  "做做爱爱  吃吃蛋糕"012---It's like that old saying, "have some sex, eat some cake."
小摩   老钱   我来拿汽水012---Hey, Mon. Hey, Chan. Just getting a soda.

我代替卡尔道歉  卡尔是谁012---Look, I got to apologize on behalf of Carl. Who the hell is Carl?
我没说吗012---Oh, did I not mention?
我找卡尔来演我的双胞胎兄弟   好参加医学研究012---Carl is a guy I hired to be my identical twin for a medical research project.
有时妙计就在眼前  是吧012---You know, sometimes the good ideas are just right in front of you, aren't they?
我知道这有点疯狂   不过我认为也许能行得通012---Look, I know it sounds crazy, but I think it might work.
唯一的问题是卡尔的演技012---But the only problem is Carl's acting is:
唯一的问题012---The only problem?
对  他害我两年前  痛失那条果汁大广告  记得吗012---Yeah. He's the reason I didn't get that big Minute Maid commercial a couple of years ago remember?
我们演兄弟   他却搞砸了012---We were supposed to be brothers, but he messed it up.

不是你是不是  是你有没有012---It's not something you are, it's something you have.
快说012---Say it.
我可以轻易挣脱012---I could easily get out of this...
但你们可能会死得很惨012---...but there's a chance you could get very, very hurt.
好  卡尔  接着就是我们  记住  这次不能怎样012---All right, Carl, we're next. Now, remember, what is this not gonna be?
重蹈那次果汁广告的覆辙  没错012---Another Minute Maid fiasco. That's right.
你不能怎样012---And what are you not gonna do?
我不能讲话  因为  你还讲  卡尔012---I'm not gonna talk, because-Ah. Damn it, Carl.

刚才最后012---Um, you know that last move...
那个女人把你绊倒  压在地上012---...where that woman tripped you and then pinned you to the floor?
你接下来会怎么做012---What would you do next?
她会拿钥匙来刺012---Well, then she'd take her keys and jam them in your--
不  不是  是你会怎么做012---No, no, no. What would you do next?
你是说攻击者  是的012---Who, me, the attacker? Yes, that's right.

我想偷袭两个女人  却没成功012---I tried attacking two women. Did not work.
什么  没关系012---What? No, I mean, it's okay.
她们是我的朋友  我还跟其中一个结过婚012---I mean, they're my friends. In fact, I was married to one of them.
说白了  你偷袭你的前妻012---Let me get this straight. You attacked your ex-wife?
不  不是012---Oh, no, no, no. Heh.
我试图偷袭012---I tried.
却打不过她   所以才来找你012---But I couldn't. That's why I'm here.
或许我们可以一起对付她们012---Maybe we could attack them together.
你不要012---That's a no.
我非常非常非常对不起012---I am so, so, so sorry.
我会下厨房煮你想吃的菜012---Oh! And I will cook anything you want in here...
