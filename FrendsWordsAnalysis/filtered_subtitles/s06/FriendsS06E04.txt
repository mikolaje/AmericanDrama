你看012---Look at that.
多巧啊  你要搬来跟我住012---How weird is that? You know, you're moving in with me...
而我就缺一个开罐器012---...and you have the one thing I don't have. Ha, ha.
彷佛是你让我变得完整012---It's like, in a way, you complete me. Huh?
我是说厨房  什么012---Kitchen. What?
你让我的厨房变得完整   室友012---You complete me kitchen, matey.
罗斯  我知道你在想什么  什么012---Ross, I know what you're thinking. What?
她搬去跟你住之后012---That she's gonna move in with you...
或许会爱上你012---...and then maybe fall in love with you, and then...
等她发现你们还有婚姻关系  就会很高兴012---...when she finds out you're already married, oh, she'll be happy.
你真的很悲哀012---You know? You're just-You're very sad.
我的天哪012---Oh, my God.
我终于知道了  你爱上瑞秋了012---I see what this is. You are in love with Rachel.
什么  没错  这就对了012---What? Of course. It all adds up.
你迷恋她012---I mean, you're obsessed with her. It's always:
"罗斯  瑞秋的事怎么办"012---"Ross, what are you gonna do about Rachel?
"罗斯  你为何要跟瑞秋住"012---Ross, why are you moving in with Rachel?
"你何时要承认没办注销"012---When are you gonna confess your secret marriage to Rachel?"
你想要她  乱讲012---You want her. No!
电话救了你一命012---Uh-oh. Saved by the bell.
你好012---Hello.
瑞秋  这对烛台不是我的吗012---Hey, Rach. Aren't these Candlesticks mine?
不   那是我买的012---No, no, I bought those.
对喔   我忘了  对012---Oh, right. I forgot. Yeah.

不会  太好了  我星期一过去  再次谢谢你012---No, no, that's great. I'll be there Monday. And thank you again.
好的012---0Kay.
是纽约大学   古生物学的012---Um, that was the head of the paleontology department...
系…主…任012---...at NYU.
他…说…什么012---Wow. What did he say?
记得我那篇沉积速率论文吗012---Uh, remember that paper I had published last year on sediment flow rate?
他们很喜欢  有谁会不喜欢012---Well, they loved it. Well, who wouldn't?
就是嘛012---I know!
总之   他们要聘我当客座教授012---Anyway, they asked me to be a guest lecturer.
是暂时的  但表现好就可能转任正职012---I mean, it's temporary, but if they like me, it could lead to a full-time job.
标在信箱上可帅了  盖勒教授012---How great would that look on the mailbox, huh? Professor Geller.

老友记  第六季  第4集  装腔作调012---Friends  S06E04  The One Where Joey Loses His Insurance
嘿  嗨012---Hey. Hi.
嘿   怎么了012---Hey. What's the matter?
嗯012---Well, ahem.
我不是在看巫师（通灵的或有特异功能）吗   是啊012---You know that psychic I see? Yeah?
她说我这个星期会死012---She told me that I'm gonna die this week...
所以我有点沮丧012---...so I'm kind of bummed about that.
什么  对   我知道你们不太懂通灵术012---What? I know you don't know about readings...
但这应该算是最糟糕的预言了012---...but that one is pretty much the worst one you can get.
菲比   这也太夸张了012---Phoebe, that's crazy.
她居然咒你死012---I can't believe she'd say that to you?
亲爱的  你不会相信吧012---Yeah, honey, you don't believe her, do you?
我不知道  她预言过我会生三胞胎012---I don't know. She, you know, said that I'd have triplets...
但她也说会有一个黑宝宝012---...but she also said one of them would be black.
纯属好奇啊   她有提到死法吗012---Just out of curiosity, did she tell you how you were gonna go?
没有   她到最后才告诉我012---No, because she didn't tell me I was gonna die till the end of the session.
我不想再跟她多耗一小时了012---And I was not gonna waste a whole other hour there.
我只剩下一星期了012---I mean, I've only got a week left, you know?
我得开始享受人生了012---I've really gotta start living now.
大家好  嗨012---Hey, everyone. Oh, hi.
嘿   我今天第一次上课012---Hey. Hey. Well, today's my first lecture...
想找你们演练一下  可以吗012---...and I kind of wanted to try it out on you guys. Do you mind?
好啊   没问题012---No, that'd be great.
好吧012---0Kay.
沉积速率有三个主要理论012---"There are three primary theories concerning sediment flow rate.
每一个还可以细分为两个012---Each of these theories can be further subcategorized into two"
我就是这样死的012---Oh, this is it. This is what's gonna kill me.
类别  第一个是012---"Subcategories. The first of these subcategories is"
罗斯012---Um, Ross? Heh.
你那张纸上有裸女吗012---Are there, uh, naked chicks on that piece of paper?
没有  怎么了012---No. Why?
我没见过纸上没有裸女012---Well, I just never seen a guy stare so hard at paper...
男人还会死盯着看012---...that didn't have naked chicks on it.
好  好012---Oh, okay. Okay.
沉积速率012---"There are three primary theories...
有三个主要理论012---...concerning sediment flow rate.
每一个还可以012---Each of these theories...
细分为两个012---...can be further subcategorized into--"
不如以笑话来开场012---Why don't you open with a joke?
以笑话开场   那是大学啊   不是喜剧俱乐部012---Open with a joke? It's a university, not a comedy club.
等一下  且慢012---Wait a minute, hold the phone.
是咯咯窃笑大学吗012---You're not talking about Chuckles University?
好012---0Kay.
开玩笑的啦012---Ohh! We’re kidding! Come on, we're kidding.
你知道怎么搞才会比较有趣吗012---hey you know what might make it less boring?
谢谢你012---Thank you.
运用影像辅助012---Some, um-Some visual aids.
你知道  哪种影像辅助最好吗012---Oh, oh! You know what's a good visual aid?
别跟我说裸女012---Please don't say naked chicks.
为什么不行啊012---Why not?
我真不知道干嘛要找你们商量012---I don't even know why I bothered to even talk to you guys about it.
我自己解决   不必用裸女012---You know, I'm just gonna do it on my own, with no naked chicks.
我十九岁之前就是那样012---That's the way I did it till I was 19.
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey
有什么好消息吗012---Any good mail?
有  演员工会寄信给你012---Yes, you got something from the Screen Actors Guild.
可能是重播费  你帮我拆一下  我012---Ooh, it's probably a residual check. Hey, can you open it? I got...
"保险中止"   太奇怪了012---"Benefits lapsed." Hmm. That's weird.
我不记得演过这部片子012---I don't remember being in a movie called Benefits Lapsed.
这不是支票012---Okay, it's not a check.
信上说由于你去年工作的不够012---They're saying your health insurance expired because...
你的医疗保险过期了   我看看012---...you didn't work enough last year. Let me see that.
好012---All right.
不会吧012---Oh, I can't believe this.
好烂喔012---This sucks.
有保险时   我可以被车撞012---When I had insurance, I could get hit by a bus...
或是被火烧012---...or catch on fire, you know?
我都无所谓   现在却得小心了012---And it wouldn't matter. Now I gotta be careful?
真可惜   被火烧这种事012---I'm sorry, man. There's never a good time to have to...
停了总是不好012---...stop catching on fire.
好吧012---All right, well...
我得找工作了  我去见经纪人012---...I guess I gotta go get a job. I'm gonna see my agent.
过马路要小心左右来车012---Okay, make sure to look both ways before you cross the street.
"过马路要小心左右来车"012---"Make sure to look both ways before you cross the street."
嘿   菲比  你还活着012---Hey. Hey, Pheebs, you're still alive.
感觉如何012---How are you feeling?
等死好累啊012---It's so exhausting, waiting for death.
对了   你能不能012---Oh, by the way, do you think you--
菲比  你干什么012---Pheebs, what are you doing?
我在替你做心理   你没有以为我死了吗012---I was preparing you for-Didn't you think I was dead?
我装得不像吗012---Did that not come off?
真像啊  吓死我了  我还以为我们永别了012---Oh, yeah, scared the hell out of me. I thought we'd lost you forever.
菲比  你要不要睡下  好  谢谢012---Pheebs, you wanna lie down? Yeah, thanks.
对了  帮我一个忙012---And listen, can you do me a favor?
两个小时后叫我012---Could you just wake me up in a couple hours.
如果还能叫得醒的话012---You know, if you can.
摩妮卡012---Monica?
这是你摆回去的012---Did you take these back?
不  不是  我很喜欢  就去买了一对012---No-no, I-I just, I liked them so much that I went out and bought some for myself.
真的很好看  对吧012---Oh, yeah, they're really great, aren't they?
我好喜欢012---I love them. Yeah.
想耍诈012---Nice try.
哈罗   课上得怎样012---Hello. Hey, how'd the lecture go?
很顺利啊012---It went great.
既不需要笑话   也不需要裸女012---And I didn't need any jokes or naked chicks either.
太好了  抱歉之前没有好好帮忙012---Oh, that's great. I'm sorry we weren't supportive before.
我就知道   教材充实最重要012---I knew all I had to do was let the material speak for itself.
每个人都说  "你得表现的既风趣又性感"012---Everyone's all, uh, "Ross, you have to be funny and sexy."
我证明他们错了012---Well, I proved them wrong.
我现在就去告诉乔伊和钱德012---And now I'm gonna pass the news on to Joey and Chandler.
说你既不风趣也不性感   没错012---That you're not funny or sexy? That's right.
伊斯特  听着  哇012---Hey, Estelle, listen-Well, well, well.
乔伊崔比亚尼012---Joey Tribbiani.
回来了  是吧012---So you came back, huh?
每个人都以为走比较好  但最后012---They think they can do better, but they all...
还不都爬回来求伊斯特012---...come crawling back to Estelle.
你在说什么012---What are you talking about?
我哪有离开  你一直是我的经纪人012---I never left you. You've always been my agent.
是吗  是啊012---Really? Yeah.
我没恶意   你别在意012---Oh, well, no harm, no foul.
伊斯特  你得帮我找工作  我的医保没了012---Look, Estelle, you gotta get me some work. I lost my health insurance.
好  首先我们得做伤害控制012---All right, first thing we gotta do: damage control.
为什么  我觉得012---Why? Well, I think, uh...
可能有人012---...someone out there...
在到处中伤你012---...may have been bad-mouthing you all over town.
不要脸012---The bastard.
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
明天伊斯特帮我排了一堆试镜012---So Estelle lined up a bunch of auditions for me tomorrow.
我很快就能重新加入医保012---And I'll have my health insurance back in no time.
太好了  但你现在应该去蹲马桶吧012---That's great, but shouldn't you be on the toilet right now?
什么  你是怎么了012---What? What's wrong with you?
没什么012---Nothing.
我刚才举哑铃时  肚子突然一阵剧痛012---Well, I got this blinding pain in my stomach when I was lifting weights before.
然后就昏倒了012---And then I, uh, passed out...
而且一直就站不起来012---...and, uh, I haven't been able to stand up since. Ha, ha.
不过  应该没什么012---But I don't think it's anything serious.
这应该是疝气   你得去看医生012---This sounds like a hernia. You have to-Go to the doctor.
我才不要012---No way.
就算要去看医生012---If I'm gonna go to the doctor for anything...
也是因为肚子这里突出来012---...it's gonna be for this thing sticking out of my stomach.
那就是疝气012---That's a hernia.
我为什么要恢复健身呢012---Why'd I have to start working out again?
烂哑铃012---Damn you, 15s.
我们提早到了  还要十五分钟才会开始012---We're a little early. The lecture doesn't end for 15 minutes.
对   但我们可以偷偷溜进去看  是啊012---Yeah, but we can sneak in and watch. Yeah. Good.
你看  是姊妹会的人012---Oh, hey, look. There's some Kappa Kappa Deltas.
我以前也是会员  嘿  姊妹们012---I was a Kappa. Hey, sisters.
哇  我们以前真是犯贱012---Wow, we really are bitches.
好   瑞格比  从实验室012---Right. So when Rigby got his samples...
取回样本后012---...back from the laboratory...
有了惊人的发现012---...he made a startling discovery.
他原以为那是火山物质   其实  是沉积物012---What he believed to be igneous was, in fact, sedimentary.
他的惊愕012---Imagine his consternation when--
糟糕012---Oh, bloody hell.
你在搞什么啊012---What the hell are you doing?
我很紧张012---Look, I was nervous.
你们害我担心  我会很无聊的012---You guys had me all worried I was gonna be boring.
我上了台   学生都盯着我看012---I got up there and they were all, like, staring at me.
结果我一开口  满嘴的英国腔012---I opened my mouth and this British accent just came out.
而且还很锉012---Yeah, and not a very good one.
别再说了012---Will you, please...?
盖勒博士   我是寇特拉斯曼012---Dr. Geller? Kurt Rathman.
古生物学系教授012---I'm a professor in the paleontology department here.
可以聊聊你的课吗012---Do you have a moment to talk about your lecture?
抱歉了   我和我妹妹有约012---I'm sorry, I've got plans with my sister.
摩妮卡 盖勒012---Monica Geller.
是的  失陪一下012---Right. Will you excuse us for one moment?
你干什么012---What are you doing?
你能装  我就不能装了012---You can have an accent, but I can't?
小伙子  早啊012---Top of the morning to you, laddies.
别闹了012---Would you just please stop?
是的012---Yes.
这个季节的孟买   气候非常怡人012---Bombay is very, very nice this time of year.
帮我点个小煎饼012---Hey, will you grab me a cruller?
坐下啦012---Sit down.
拜托你去看医生  大哥  疝气手术012---Will you go to the hospital? Dude, hernia operations cost, like...
应该很贵吧012---...a lot probably, okay?
而且  它越来越黑  越来越痛012---Besides, it's getting darker and more painful.
就表示在好转012---That means it's healing.
我借你钱012---Look, I will loan you the money.
赶快去医院  把它012---Just go to the hospital and let's just get that thing...
塞回去012---...pushed back in.
谢谢  但我要很久才能还你钱012---Thank you, but it'd take me forever to pay you that money back.
我又不想惦记这件事012---And I don't want that hanging over my head, okay?
而且  只要医保恢复012---Besides, as soon as my insurance kicks in...
我就可以动各种免费手术012---...I can get all the free operations I want.
我打算先去做眼睛的雷射激光手术012---I think I'll probably start with that laser eye surgery.
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
嘿  怎么了012---Hey. What's going on?
乔伊的疝气很严重012---Well, Joey's got a bad hernia...
不过动了个眼睛雷射手术就好了012---...but it's nothing a little laser eye surgery won't fix.
真的   我跟你讲  把手压在这里012---Look, I'm telling you, if I put my hand on my stomach right here...
就不痛了012---...it doesn't hurt that bad. Ah.
搞不好你会死012---Hey, maybe you'll die.
钱德   我怕了012---Chandler, I'm scared.
我们可以一起走012---No, we can go together.
但不要拖的太久012---Just don't wait too long, though...
因为星期五之前我就会挂掉012---...because I'm out of here sometime before Friday.
但是我不想死012---But I don't want to die.
不  会很好玩的012---No, no. It'll be fun.
我们可以回来   吓吓他们012---We can come back and we can haunt these guys.
给我  不要   这是我的012---Give me them. No, they are mine.
是你偷我的  你才偷我的012---You stole them from me. You stole them from me.
拿来012---Give me them.
要不要一人一个012---You just wanna each take one?
很公平   反正也没用过012---Yeah, that seems fair. We never use them.
听着  你们真的得帮我012---Look, I really need some help, okay?
为什么   为什么我要说英国腔012---Why? Why did I have to speak in a British accent?
我该怎么办012---What do I do?
慢慢的把口音改掉012---Well, why don't you phase it out? Yeah, phase the accent out.
别人会以为你在适应美国生活012---People will think that you're adjusting to life in America.
是啊  根本不会有人注意012---Yeah, I mean, come on. No one will even notice.
搞不好根本没人在听012---I mean, they're probably not even listening to you.
没人在听我讲话012---They're not listening to me?
当然有在听你讲话012---Of course they're listening to you.
每个人都在听你讲话012---Everybody listens to you.
莫妮卡  你真的觉得我该慢慢改吗012---Monica, do you really think I should try this phasing-out thing?
我觉得你很帅啊012---I think you look fine.
好了  开始了  好012---Whenever you're ready. Okay.
提米012---Hey, Timmy.
我要给你一个012---I've got a surprise...
惊喜012---...for you.
停   抱歉012---Hold it. I'm sorry.
这个惊喜是一组新秋千  别演得这么凝重012---The surprise is a new swing set. If you could play it less intense.
好的   没问题   等我一下012---Oh, yeah. Sure, no problem. Just hold on one second.
嘿  提米012---Hey, Timmy.

这时候你要把它搬起来  没错012---That's where you pick up the bag. Exactly.
不是  台词是"搬一包"   所以你得把它搬起来012---No, the line is, "Pick up a bag," so you need to pick up the bag.
或是用指的012---Or I could just point to it. Huh?
跑路   跑路  今天就去指一包吧012---Blah, blah, blah. Purina One. Point to a bag today.
