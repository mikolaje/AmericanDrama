嗨  嘿012---Hi. Hey!
你们来干什么012---What are you doing here?
罗斯和瑞秋留言  说要结婚012---Ross and Rachel left us a message saying they were getting married!
你们不是来找他们的吗  当然是012---Isn't that why you guys are here? Yes.
不然我们来这儿干什么啊012---Why else would we be here? Ha-ha-ha.
怎么样  我们来晚了吗012---Well, what happened? Did we miss it?
我们也没赶上012---We actually missed it.
可能都是因为教堂里不能奔跑012---Well, Maybe you wouldn't have if you could run in the chapel!
真是太扯了012---This is insane.
有什么关系呢  又不是真结婚012---What's the big deal? It's not like it's a real marriage.
什么012---What?
在赌城结婚  只在赌城内有效012---If you marry in Vegas, you're only married in Vegas.
你在说什么  在赌城结婚到处都有效012---What are you talking about? If you get married in Vegas you’re married everywhere.
真的012---Really?
是啊012---Yeah.
我的妈呀012---Oh, my God.
啊  随便啦012---Oh, well.
老友记  第六季  第1集  离开拉斯维加斯012---Friends  S06E01  The One After Vegas
我们为什么躺在一起012---Why are we in bed together?
我不知道012---I don't know.
你有穿衣服吗012---Do you have any clothes on?
有012---Yes.
真的  没有012---Really? No.
但是我们没有012---But we didn't have...
嘿咻吧012---...sex, did we?
我不太记得昨晚的事012---I don't remember much about last night.
一切都好模糊012---It was such a blur. Ha, ha. Oh.
我记得我有笑   我一直笑012---I remember laughing. I laughed a lot. Uh-huh?
而且我们没怎样012---Then we didn't have sex.
我们真的醉得很惨012---Oh, I mean, we were really drunk.
幸好没干什么蠢事012---I'm glad we didn't do anything stupid.
可不是吗012---Tell me about it.
菲比  早012---Morning, Pheebs. Mm.
我的电影取消拍摄了012---Well, my movie has been officially canceled.
哇啊  乔伊  好可惜喔  你要不要吃我的早餐012---Mm. Joey, I'm so sorry. You want some of my breakfast?
算了  我沮丧的吃不下啊012---Nah, I’m too depressed to eat.
过五分钟再说吧012---I'll probably eat in, like, five minutes.
我只好跟你们回去了  飞机是几点012---So I guess I'll fly home with you. What time is your flight?
我的计程车呢  我用不着了012---What about my cab? I don't need that anymore.
乔伊  你跟我借车  就要开回去012---No, Joey! you borrowed my cab. You have to drive it back.
我不想自己开回去  太寂寞了012---I don't wanna drive back by myself. I get lonely.
干脆你来陪我012---Oh, ooh. How about if you come with me?
我不知道   要开很久  一定很好玩012---I don't know, it's a long trip. That would be great.
我们可以聊天玩游戏012---We could talk and play games.
这是让友谊变新鲜的好机会012---This could be our chance to, like, renew our friendship.
你要我跟你〝友谊复兴〞012---Are you asking me to have a "frienaissance"?
是吧012---Sure?
好吧   虽然没这个必要  但我一直爱着你012---Heh. All right, although I don't think we need one. I never stopped loving you.
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
有谁跟盖勒博士夫妇讲过话啊012---So, has anyone talked to Dr. and Mrs. Geller yet?
他们有留言给我   应该快到了012---Mm-hm. They left me a message. They'll be here.

摩妮卡和我昨晚差点结婚012---Monica and I almost got married last night.
天哪012---My God!
这可是大事012---That's huge! Ha-ha-ha, hey.
等等  为什么没找我去012---Wait a minute. Why wasn't I invited?
谁要当你的伴郎  不要说罗斯  不准说罗斯012---And who was gonna be your best man? Don't say Ross. Do not say Ross.
我觉得我们还没准备好  我很爱她012---I just don't think that Monica and I are ready to get married yet! Y’know? I mean, I love her...
但看到罗斯他们从教堂冒出来012---...but seeing Ross and Rachel come out of that chapel...
我突然惊觉  我们进展得太快了012---...was like a wake-up call that Monica and I are moving so fast, you know.
我要怎么讲才不会让她心碎012---How do I tell her without crushing her?
就说她不是结婚的料012---Tell her she's not marriage material.
什么012---What?
女生都这么对我说012---Girls say it to me all the time.
相信我   要是她和我一样  一定会如释重负012---And believe me, And if she's anything like me, she's just gonna be relieved.
我该怎么说  这样太快了012---How do I tell Chandler that it's too soon?
他一定会心碎  觉得我不爱他了012---It’s gonna break his heart, he’s not gonna think that I don’t love him anymore.
你是不爱他了  我爱012---Well, you don't. Yes, I do.
很好  我只是在测试你012---Good. I was just testing you.
嘿  噢  嗨012---Hey. Oh, hi.
我们刚才聊到培根012---Y’know, We were just talking about bacon.
不对  我们是在聊网球012---No, we were talking about tennis.
网球比较像真的012---Tennis is more believable.
嘿  嘿012---Hey.
嗨  谢谢012---Hi. Thank you.
咖啡012---Coffee. Heh. Mm.

昨晚的事吗012---...about what you guys did last night, or?
昨晚什么事  昨晚又没怎样012---What do you mean "last night"? Nothing, uh, happened last night.
罗斯把大家都找去看了012---Uh-huh. Ross invited us all to watch.
瑞秋  我们不可能错过朋友的婚礼012---Rach, we weren't gonna miss our friends marrying.
谁结婚了012---Huh, who got married?
你们啊012---You did?
什么012---What? Heh.
我们哪有结婚  怎么可能  别闹了012---Wh...? Hello. We didn't get married. No, we didn't. That’s ridiculous!...
等等  我们  我记得去过教堂012---Wait, wait, wait. I remember being in a chapel.
我们醉成那样  不可能被批准结婚的012---They would not let us get married when we were that drunk.
醉成那样  也当然可能012---They let you get married when you’re drunk!
在赌城结婚的人通常都醉了012---Most people who marry in Vegas are drunk.
我现在就醉了012---Heh, I'm drunk right now.
早餐不能喝鸡尾酒啊  我在度假012---I can't have a mimosa with breakfast? I'm on vacation.
你们要怎么办012---What are you gonna do?
看来得找个离婚律师了012---Well, I guess we find a divorce lawyer. Uh-huh.
我想罗斯已经有一个了012---Well, I think, I think Ross already has one.
这次会免费吧012---Now, this one's free, right?
你办了两次  所以会送一次012---Because you paid for the first two, third one free.
你笑吧  丢脸的是你012---Laugh it up, but the joke's on you...
我们不必离婚012---...because we don't need to get divorced.
只要办理注销  住校012---We're just gonna get an annulment. an annulment?
罗斯  学校可帮不了你012---Ross, I don't think surgery is the answer here.
那是你的正字标记012---Oh, that's your thing!
什么012---What?
你的正字标记  你是专门离婚的人012---Your thing, Y’know? that you're the guy who gets divorced.
没错012---Oh, yeah.
那才不是我的正字标记012---No, no, that's not "my thing."
我并不爱离婚012---I do not love getting divorced.
你当然爱  这是你第三次离婚012---Yes, you do. This is your third divorce.
你爱离婚爱到搞不好会娶它012---You love divorce so much, you're probably gonna marry it...
然后婚姻破裂  你又得离婚  离婚名人012---...and then it won't work out, so you're gonna have to divorce it, divorcing guy.
我醉得好厉害012---I'm so drunk.
你觉得我们该怎么办  我不知道012---So, what should we do? I don't know.
但我知道我爱你012---I know I love you.
我也知道我爱你012---I know I love you. Heh.
那我们还要012---So where are we on the whole "going back...
回过头去结婚吗  我爱你012---...to where they have the marriages" thing? I love you.
问得好012---That's a good question.
昨晚我们让骰子决定012---Look umm, Last night we let the dice decide.
也许应该再让命运决定一次  我爱你012---Maybe we should leave it up to fate again. I love you!
没错   有征兆我们才结婚012---Yes, We don't get married unless there's a sign.
好吗  那么012---Okay? So say, uh...
要是你又掷出8来  就表示我们绝对应该结婚012---You roll another eight, then there’s a definite sign that we should get married.
好  8就结婚012---All right. Eight we get married...
其他就不结012---...but 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, we don't get married.
听起来不错  好012---Sounds great. Okay.
有人要掷了012---Hey, we got a shooter.
请押注012---Money, please.
好了吗  好了012---Ready? Ready.
来个8吧012---Come on, eight.
没错  8012---Yes, yes, eight.
8   3加5是8012---Eight, easy eight.
哇   居然真的是8  真是太不可能了012---Wow, I can't believe I rolled an eight. That was so unlikely.
那就结婚吧  我猜012---Well, let's get married. I guess. Aah.
等等   那不是双四八  我昨晚掷的是双四八012---Wait a minute. That wasn't hard eight!  Last night I rolled a hard eight.
没错  这个8不对  不能结婚了  妈的012---That’s right! It was the wrong kind of eight. No wedding! Damn it!
我好想结婚喔012---Agh! Aah! Unh, I wanted it so bad!
收拾行李去  好012---Wanna go pack? Yeah.
我们没做错吧  当然  没错012---We're doing the right thing, right? Oh, of course we are.
我们让命运决定012---Heh, we left it up to fate.
如果我们应该结婚  一定会有明确的征兆012---If we were supposed to get married, there would be a clear-cut sign.
好  你还剩十九个问题  要好好把握012---Okay, you have 19 questions left. Use them wisely.
快点  乔伊  你不能赢了  如果你不问012---Come on, Joey. You can't win if you don't ask any...
问题012---questions!
怎样啦  你说会很好玩012---What? You promised me a fun road trip.
结果我们开了六小时  你就睡了五个小时半012---We've been on the road for 6 hours, and you've been asleep for 5 and a half.
到下一个休息站就换手  你给我一路开回去012---We are switching at the next rest stop and you are going to drive all the way back!
这是对你的惩罚   贪睡鬼012---That will be your punishment, you greedy sleeper.
好啦  好啦 012---All right. All right.
现在你得唱歌给我听012---Yeah. And until then, you are going to sing to me.
因为收音机坏了  你又很自私  但歌声很好听012---Because the radio's broken, and you are selfish, but you have a nice voice.
是喔  快唱012---Really? Sing!
真是开也开不完012---Man, this is a long drive.
我的眼睛  睁开了吗012---Are my eyes open?
没有012---No!
早安012---Morning. Aah!
嘿  老公012---Hey. Hey, hubby. Heh.
我想找你讨论012---Yeah. Actually, um, I wanted to talk to you...
注销婚姻的事012---...about that whole annulment thing. Uh-huh?
我不打算去办012---Yeah, I'm not gonna do that.
好012---Okay. Heh.
那我们就维持婚姻关系012---So we'll just stay married.
是的  没错012---Yes, exactly.
我会请大家叫我盖勒太太012---And I will make everyone call me Mrs. Geller.
真是太棒了012---Wow, this is so amazing.
我还以为得加把劲说服你012---I, uh, really thought I'd have to talk you into this more.
我现在怕了  因为你好像不是在说笑012---Okay, see now I’m scared because I don't actually think you're kidding.
我不是啊012---I'm not kidding.
听着  我012---Look, I... I... Heh.
我不能有三次失败的婚姻012---I can't have three failed marriages.
我不能  好吗012---I can't, okay?
我不要当那个人012---I am not gonna be that guy.
所以  我们要永远这样下去012---So, what, we just stay married forever?
好  这012---Okay, how...?
说真的  你有什么影响012---How is this going to affect you, really?
我是说  偶尔填表格要打勾时012---I mean, you fill some form out once in a while...
你就勾〝已婚〞那一格012---...instead of checking the box "Miss," you check the box that says, "Mrs."
就在〝未婚〞旁边012---It's right next to it.
好  抱歉  你说得对  我们确实012---Ohh, Okay. I'm sorry, you're right. You know what?
可以维持现状012---We absolutely can stay married, ...
我还以为那两格离得很远012---...because I was under the impression that the boxes boxes were far away from each other.
好  你就012---All right. Look, just...
请你冷静下来012---...please take a moment here...
想一想  你在叫我做什么012---...and think about what you're asking of me. Okay?
我在请你帮我一个忙012---I am asking you to do me a favor.
你是要我当你的老婆012---You are asking me to be your wife.
而身为我的老婆  你应该帮我这个忙012---And, as my wife, I think you should grant me this favor.
那个小孩踢得好用力012---That kid kicked me really hard.
是你扯他的头发012---Well, you did pull his hair.
他拿我的零食  我不想再争了012---He took my snack. I'm not getting into this again.
好啦  说真的  真的很痛012---All right, you know what? Hurts really bad.
我就叫你不要走路  来012---Well, I told you not to walk. Here.
来吧012---There. There. Okay.
这没有任何含意吧  没有012---This doesn't mean anything, does it? No.
好012---Okey.
你怎么可以让人搭便车012---How could you pick up a hitchhiker?
他搞不好是强  强暴犯或杀人犯什么的012---He could be a rape... He could be a rapist or a killer or something.
你以为我没有先问过吗012---Don't you think I asked him that before he got in?
我不理你了  你睡你的觉012---Y’know what? I'm not talking to you. You go back to sleep.
你  你是强暴犯吗  不是012---And, you, are you a rapist? No.

听着  我知道你想找我谈012---Listen. I know you wanted to talk to me...
但我有个办法  或许能让你愿意维持现状012---...but I have an idea that may make you wanna stay married.
我们登记注册  礼物都给你012---We register and you get to keep all the presents.
不行  罗斯  你听我说012---No, Ross, come on. No, listen.
我一直在想要怎么表达012---look I've thought about how to tell you this, and, um,
罗斯  总之我们不能维持婚姻关系012---the bottom line, Ross...is we cannot stay married.
那可不一定  当然一定012---I don't know if that's true... Oh, but it is.
你知道吗012---Ahem. Okay. You know what this is?
这就叫做意见不合012---This is a difference of opinion.
在婚姻中遇到这种状况  罗斯012---When that happens in a marriage... Oh, Ross, come on!
这不是  这不是婚姻  这是全世界最惨的宿醉012---This is not, this is not a marriage! This is the world's worst hangover!

拜托啦  菲比  我受不了了012---Come on, Pheebs, I can't take this anymore.
求求你跟我说话012---Please talk to me.
让我补偿你012---Let me make it up to you, huh?
闭嘴  够了012---Stop it! Stop it! No.
不公平   你明知我无法抗拒  你那美妙的歌声012---That's not fair. You know I can't resist that beautiful voice.
菲比  我真的很抱歉012---Pheebs, look, I am so sorry.
我答应让你旅途愉快012---I know I promised you a fun road trip with your friend...

我们要不要干脆结婚算了012---All right, should we just, should we just get married?
就这么做  反正所有的征兆都叫我们结012---Y’know? I mean should we just do it? All the signs are telling us to do it.
我不想理会什么征兆了012---I'm sick of the signs.
这样太快了  我很满意现状  我也是012---It’s too fast, I'm happy the way things are. Me too.
