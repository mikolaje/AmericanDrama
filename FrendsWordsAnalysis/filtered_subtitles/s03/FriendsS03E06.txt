她们要做什么  不知道  女生的事情012---What are they doing? I don't know. Something girly.
嘿  你回来早了012---Hey, you're early.
你拿着灯干嘛012---What are you doing with the lamp?

对喔  抱歉012---Oh, right. Sorry.
天啊  真不敢相信012---God, I don't believe this!
有人问你要不要喝柠檬汁  就代表想上床吗012---Someone asks you in for lemonade and that means they want to have sex?

你在说什么   对不起012---What are you talking about?  I'm sorry.
我不住在这里了012---I don't live here anymore.
我不知道怎么跟你说  但是其他人都知道012---I didn't know how to tell you. But, you know, everybody else knows.
大家都知道012---Everybody knows?
这应该是件好事的  我忘记原因了012---That was supposed to be a good thing. I forget why.
摩妮卡  我有一个月的时间  睡不着觉012---Monica, do you know I couldn't sleep for a month...
就因为我在沙发垫上  滴了一滴墨水012---...because I got a dot of ink on one of the sofa cushions?
你可以把抱枕翻面啊012---You could've just turned the cushion over.
本来会的  但是另外一边  沾到意大利面酱汁012---I would have, but I had a spaghetti stain on the other side.
什么012---What?
我就是这个意思012---This is what I'm talking about.

我很爱你  我希望我们能当朋友012---And I love you. And I want us to be friends.
如果我留在这里  就没办法了012---And if I stay here, I don't see that happening.
我也爱你  好012---I love you too. Good.
怎么了012---What?
怎么了  我只是难过而已012---What? I'm just sad.
才不是  你在想是哪一个垫子012---No, you're not. You're wondering which cushion it is.
你在看什么012---So what are you watching?
海滩游侠012---Baywatch.
在演什么012---What's it about?
救生员012---Lifeguards.

菲比搬出去了012---Phoebe moved out.
对喔012---Right.
我不懂012---I don't understand.
跟我住那么困难吗   这是我没有男友的原因吗012---Am I so hard to live with? Is this why I don't have a boyfriend?
不…012---No...
你没有男友是因为…012---You don't have a boyfriend because...
我不知道为什么  你没有男友012---I don't know why you don't have a boyfriend.
你应该要有的012---You should have a boyfriend.
我是这么认为012---I think so.
过来012---Come here.
听好  你是我最喜欢的人之一012---Listen, you are one of my favorite people...

我想我的婚姻…012---I think my marriage...
应该是完蛋了012---...is kind of over.
不会吧  怎么了012---Oh, no! Why?
因为卡萝是女同志012---Because Carol's a lesbian.
而我不是女同志012---And I'm not one.
而且这显然不是一时激情012---And apparently it's not a mix-and-match situation.
天啊012---Oh, my God!
我不敢相信012---I don't believe it!
可怜的孩子012---Oh, you poor bunny.
我是个白痴012---I'm an idiot.
我早该料到的012---I mean, I should have seen it.
卡萝和我出门时  她如果看到漂亮的女生…012---I mean, Carol and I would be out, and she'd see some beautiful woman...
就会说 "罗斯  你快看"012---...and she'd be, "Ross! Look at her!"
我还觉得…012---And I'd think
"天啊  我老婆太酷了"012---"God, my wife is cool." Heh.
嘿  你觉得那个苏珊  是她的情人吗012---Aw. Hey, do you think that Susan person is her lover?

我们在一起七年了012---I mean, we've been together seven years.
她是唯一爱过我的女人012---She's the only woman who's ever loved me.
也是我唯一有过…012---She's the only woman I've ever...
噢   罗斯012---Oh, Ross.

我知道012---I know.
谢谢012---Thanks.
如果我更关心她  或更注意她012---Maybe this wouldn't have happened if I'd been more nurturing...
这一切或许就不会发生了012---...or I'd paid more attention...
有子宫也行012---...or I had a uterus.
我不敢相信  我知道012---I can't believe it. I know.
你不该受这种折磨  真的  罗斯012---You know, you don't deserve this. You don't, Ross.
你真的很棒  谢谢012---You're so good. Thanks.
而且你很体帖012---And you're so sweet.
谢谢  人又好012---Thanks. And you're kind.
谢谢012---Thanks.
过来012---Come here.
等等…012---Wait, wait, wait.
没关系012---It's okay.
等等  我的脚卡在球袋里012---Wait, wait, wait! My foot is stuck in the pocket.
怎么了  我拿不出来012---What? I can't get it out.
女生可不想听到这个012---That's not something a girl wants to hear.
别提这个012---Come on, don't start.
又怎么了012---Ow! What?
那些烂球好碍事012---Stupid balls are in the way.
