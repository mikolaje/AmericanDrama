尝尝看吧012---Taste it.
对  这是一杯脂肪012---Yeah, it's fat.
我喝了脂肪012---I drank fat!
我知道  两分钟前我才喝过的012---I know, I did that two minutes ago.
嘿  穿燕尾服的先生012---Hey, Mr. Tux.

那是四分钟前的事  我们必须在七点四十出门012---That was four minutes ago. We have to be out the door at 20 to 8.
放心  我们会准备好的  我们只要两分钟就着装完毕012---Relax, we'll be ready. It takes us two minutes to get dressed.
若你们现在就换好  我会高兴一些012---I'd feel better if you got dressed now.

你怎么不早点过来  因为我真是笨得要命012---How come you didn't come over earlier? Because I'm a stupid, stupid man.
罗斯  要不要来点苹果汁012---Hey, Ross, want some cider?
不要012---No.
你快准备好了吧012---So you're pretty close, huh?
妆化好了  头发梳好了012---Makeup's on. Hair's done.
我只要换衣服就好了012---I just have to get dressed.
大概只要6或7分钟吧012---And that takes, what? Just 6 or 7 minutes?
是啊  只要我决定好要穿什么012---Yeah. Once I figure out what I'm wearing.
要不要喝点脂肪012---Glass of fat?

菲比  你…012---Phoebe, you...
你真是我的偶像啊012---You are my star.
那你就是我的幸运铜板012---Aw. Well, you're my lucky penny.
好吧  我做了心理测验  结果是我认为事业比男人重要012---All right, I took the quiz, and it turns out I do put career before men.
起来012---Get up.
什么012---What?
你坐在我的位子上  为何这是你的位子012---You're in my seat. How is this your seat?
因为我刚才坐在这里012---I was sitting there.
但是你离开了012---But then you left.
拜托  我又不是去西班牙那么远的地方012---Well, it's not like I went to Spain.
我是去洗手间  你明知道我会回来的012---I went to the bathroom. You knew I'd be back.
那有什么大不了的  去坐别的地方嘛012---What's the big deal? Sit somewhere else!
真正大不了的就是  我是最后坐在这里的人  所以012---The "big deal" is, I was sitting there last! So...
这是我的位子012---...it's my seat.
事实上  你最后坐的地方是那里  所以…012---Well, actually, the last place you were sitting was in there, so...
各位  那个一点都不重要012---You guys, you know what? It doesn't matter.
你们俩都必须在我脑血管爆掉前换好衣服012---You both have to go get dressed before the big vein in my head pops.
我只要再做一件事  这真的没什么大不了012---I just have to do one thing. It's not a big deal.
起来012---Get up!
嗨  嘿012---Hi. Hey.
菲比  你看起来好美012---Ooh. Phoebe, you look great!
好啦  早知道了012---All right already.
你要变魔术吗012---Ooh. Are you gonna do magic?

若晚会开始后我们才进场  大家都看得到012---Everyone will see if we arrive after it starts.
有人喝过我这一杯脂肪吗012---Has somebody been drinking my fat?
这像是古生物学家女友  会穿的衣服吗012---Does this look like something a paleontologist's girlfriend would wear?
我不知道  你大概是首开先例吧012---I don't know. You might be the first one.
瑞秋  你听答录机留言了吗  没有012---Rach, did you check the machine? No.
等等  这件衣服会显得我小腿很粗  算了012---Wait. This is the outfit that makes my calves look fat. Never mind.
乔伊  我今天写了一首歌012---Well, Joey, I wrote a little song today.
歌名叫做《起来》012---It's called, "Get up!"
好啦  椅子给你啦012---All right. You can have the chair.
真的  天啊  你看看这个012---Really? Oh, my. Would you look at that?
是我  我正要过去012---I'm coming over.
若你播出这则留言时  我已经到了呢012---What if I'm already there when you play this message?
是不是很诡异012---Is that too spooky?
瑞秋  你在不在  是我  快接电话012---Hi, Rach, are you there? It's me. Pick up.
瑞秋…012---Rachel? Rach?

摩妮卡  我是理查  打电话给我012---Monica, it's Richard. Call me.
这则留言是新的还是旧的012---Is that message old or new?
新的还是旧的…012---Old or new? Old or new?
绝对是旧的  你没听到两声哔吗012---It's definitely old. Didn't you hear the double beep?
若是新的怎么办  我们说好不联络的012---What if it's new? We agreed not to talk.
可能有重要的事  我该不该回电话012---It could be important. Shouldn't I call him back?
甜心  你已经打过了  这是旧的留言012---Honey, you did call him back. It's old.
是的  你听012---Yeah, see, Mon, listen. Listen.
当卡萝与我分手时012---When Carol and I broke up...

我去换好衣服012---I got dressed.
快快快012---Really, really quickly, okay? Okay?
这就对了…012---There we go. There we go.
这样吧  别起来了  就坐在那里吧012---You know what? Don't get up. Just sit there.
只希望你别介意我的手放在这里012---I just hope you don't mind my hand right here.
没碰到  不能生气  没碰到  不能生气012---Not touching. Can't get mad! Not touching. Can't get mad!
没碰到  不能生气012---Not touching. Can't get mad!
我的天啊012---Oh! Oh, my God!
你们这些坏孩子012---You rotten boys!
真抱歉  菲比  我该怎么办012---Sorry, Phoebe. What am I gonna do?
别乱抹  有什么可以去除豆泥沾酱012---Don't rub it! What gets out hummus?
有什么可以去除豆泥沾酱012---What gets out hummus?
摩妮卡  有什么可以去除豆泥沾酱012---Monica! What gets out hummus?
如果那个留言是新的  他到底打来说什么012---If it is a new message, what is he calling to say?
好  谢谢  我会试试看的012---Okay, thanks. Yeah, I'll try that.
说不定他打来说  你执迷不悟  而且太疯狂012---Maybe he called to say you're obsessive and crazy?
我该不该回电话给他  不012---So should I call him back?  No!
不012---No!
很好  我们一起坐在椅子上  随便啊012---Fine, we'll both sit in the chair. Fine with me.
我好舒服啊012---I am so comfortable.
我也是012---Me too.
事实上  我可能有点太舒服012---In fact, I think I might be a little too comfortable.
好  我们有19分钟  钱德  我要你去换衣服012---Okay, we have 19 minutes. I want you to go and change.
等你回来后  乔伊去换衣服  他就会把椅子空出来012---When you come back, Joey will go change, and he'll have vacated the chair.
好  好的012---Okay. All right.
好  我要走了012---Fine. I'm going.
等我回来后  这里就是椅子王国  而我是…012---When I get back, it's Chair City. And I'm the guy...
坐在椅子上的那个人012---...who's sitting in a chair!
这是不是有点太…012---Is this a little too...?
菲比  怎么回事012---Pheebs? What happened?
我沾到鹰嘴豆酱了012---I got the hummus.
甜心  我们会找出衣服给你  你要不要穿我的黑外套012---Oh, honey, we'll find you something. You wanna wear my black jacket?
这样跟洋装就不能搭配了  没错012---It won't go with this dress. You're right.
来吧  我们把衣服换掉  不…别换掉012---Well, let's just get you out of that. No, no, no. Not out of that.
千万别把衣服脱掉  菲比  可以穿你的绿洋装吗012---Not out of clothes. Can Phoebe borrow your green dress?
我打给他了012---I called him.
对  电话进到他的答录机  然后我留言了012---Yes. I got his machine and I left a message.
不过没关系…012---But it's okay. It's okay...
因为那是个闲聊式的  轻松的留言012---...because it was, like, a casual, breezy message.
很轻松012---It was breezy.
天啊  若听起来并不轻松该怎么办012---Oh, God, what if it wasn't breezy?
怎么可能不轻松  不会  这里是个轻松的地方012---How could it not be breezy? No, because you're in such a breezy place.
我知道了  我播出我的留言  你们再告诉我是否轻松012---I got it. I'll play my message, and you guys tell me if it's breezy enough.
你怎么可能那样做012---But how you gonna do that?
我知道他答录机的密码012---I know the code to his answering machine.
好  摩妮卡  我不认为现在应该…012---Okay, Mon, I really don't think this is the...
好  你在拨号了…012---Okay, you're dialing. You are dialing.
我是理查  请在哔声后留言012---Hi, this is Richard. Please leave a message at the tone.
你有两个新讯息012---You have two new messages.
真是个好差事012---What a cool job.
〝你有两个新讯息〞012---"You have two new messages."
〝请把派递给我〞012---Please pass the pie.
我是摩妮卡  我只是想确定一下012---Hi, it's Monica. I'm just checking in.
我有一通留言  不知道是新的还是旧的012---I got a message and didn't know if it was old or new...
所以  我只是问问看012---...so I'm just checking.
告诉我吧012---So let me know.
或者不告诉我  都可以012---Or don't. Whatever.
我很轻松012---I'm breezy!
你不能说〝我很轻松〞  这样就不轻松了012---You can't say you're "breezy." That negates the "breezy."
你好啊  是我  昨天真的很开心012---Hola. It's me. Yesterday was really fun.
打给我  我们来聊聊周末的计划  好吗012---Call me about this weekend, okay?
看  她听起来就很轻松012---Now, she sounded breezy.
他开始约会了  我真不敢相信他开始约会012---He's seeing someone. I can't believe he's seeing someone.
你还不能那么肯定  那么  那是谁的声音012---You don't know that. Well, whose voice was that?
说不定是他妹妹的  说不定是他女儿的012---Maybe it was his sister's. Maybe it was his daughter's.
蜜雪儿  一定是了  听起来像蜜雪儿吗012---Michelle. Of course! Did it sound like Michelle?
太好了  开始下雨了  这样计程车更难叫到了012---Oh, great. It's starting to rain. That'll make it easier to get a cab.
是蜜雪儿012---It was Michelle.
绝对是蜜雪儿012---It was definitely Michelle.
去试穿摩妮卡的绿洋装  不适合就穿我的灰色丝质洋装012---Try Monica's green dress. If it doesn't fit, wear my gray silk one.
那我要穿哪件  你还不知道自己要穿什么012---Unless I wear it. You don't know what you're wearing?
今晚是你的大日子  我只是希望自己好看一点012---I'm just trying to look nice for your big night.
是啊  而我们在12分钟内必须出门012---Yeah, which we have to leave for in 12 minutes.
来吧  我帮你选衣服012---Come on, I'll just pick something out for you.
你看到了  我全换好了012---You'll notice that I'm fully dressed.
而我呢  也发现你什么都还没换012---I, in turn, have noticed that you are not.
所以  引用艾伦米恩的话〝离开我的椅子 驴蛋〞012---So in the words of A.A. Milne, "Get out of my chair, dill-hole."
好吧012---Okay.
你在干什么  你叫我离开椅子啊012---What are you doing? You said to give you the chair.
你又没说不能带走椅垫012---You didn't say anything about cushions.
但椅垫是椅子的重点012---They're the essence of the chair!
没错  我要带走重点012---That's right! I'm taking the essence.
他会回来的012---Oh, he'll be back.
这里什么人也没有012---Oh, there's nobody in the room.
对不起  我觉得这样很美  这是万圣节服装012---I'm sorry, I thought it looked pretty. That was a Halloween costume.
除非你要我穿的像小牧羊女一样012---Unless you would like me to go as Little Bo Peep.
如果没有那只可充气的羊  我还真认不出来012---I didn't recognize it without that inflatable sheep.
是啊  对了  钱德  记得还给我012---Yeah, which, by the way, Chandler, I would like back one of these days.
瑞秋  很好啊  这件是不是很适合我012---Rach, good! Listen, isn't this perfect for me?
太棒了  但是不适合今晚012---Oh, it's perfect! But not for tonight.
当然不适合今晚  这像是去慈善晚会的装束012---Of course not for tonight. Hi. I'm going to a benefit.
不适合今晚  那你穿它干嘛012---Not for tonight? What are you doing?
对不起  他没别的意思  我爱你…深呼吸012---No, I'm sorry. We didn't mean it. I love you. Breathe.
我们去露营时  把它们当枕头012---We used them as pillows when we went camping.
什么012---What?
那些羊啊012---The sheep.
你的闲暇时间在干嘛…012---Hey, what you do on your own time...
我的内裤呢012---Where's my underwear? Whoa, whoa, whoa.
拜托  你拿了他的内裤  他拿走我的重点啊012---Come on, you took his underwear? He took my essence!
好  等等  你干嘛不穿你身上的内裤012---Okay, hold on. Why can't you just wear the underwear you're wearing now?
因为我现在根本没有穿内裤012---Because I'm not wearing any underwear now.
那你今晚为何要穿内裤012---Then why do you have to wear underwear tonight?
因为这燕尾服是租的012---It's a rented tux, okay?
我不想没穿内裤就穿别人的衣服012---I'm not gonna go "commando" in another man's fatigues.
那有人就得把椅垫还给别人012---Then somebody's gonna have to give somebody back his cushions.
好  你把我衣服藏起来  我要做一件完全相反的事012---Okay. You hide my clothes. I'm gonna do the exact opposite to you.
什么  难道你要给我看我的衣服吗012---What, are you gonna show me my clothes?
嘿  相反的…012---Hey, opposite...
就是相反的事012---...is opposite.
他什么都没有012---He's got nothing!
好  我准备好了012---Okay, I'm ready.
瑞秋那里没有我喜欢的  除了这个圣诞彩带012---Rachel didn't have anything I liked but this ribbon.
我想  好吧  那我就政治化一点吧012---I thought, all right, I'll be political.
那你在支持什么  当然是圣诞节012---What are you supporting?  Christmas.
我无所谓  已经搞定两个了  我还有整整12分钟012---Hey, that's okay with me. Two down, and I have exactly 12 minutes...
什么012---What?
我的表停了  我的表  你看…012---My watch stopped. My watch. Okay, see...
这个恐龙指针的尾巴不动了012---...the dinosaur tail isn't going around anymore.
现在几点  已经7点33分  我还有7分钟012---What time is it? It's 7:33. I have 7 minutes.
我还有7分钟012---I have seven minutes!
我该穿哪一双鞋  黑色的还是紫色的012---Which shoes should I wear? The black or the purple?
随便挑一双  好吗  好啦  黑色的012---Just pick one, okay? Oh, okay, okay. The black.
你有没有黑色带细带子的012---Do you have black with little strappies?
有  不过那种适合配裤子  或者我该穿裤子012---Yeah, but those go better with pants. Maybe I should wear pants.
对了  穿裤子是好主意  或者不要穿裤子更好012---Yeah, pants! What an idea! Or better yet, go without pants.
我不知道你在做什么  但是你快进去…012---I don't know what you're doing but just get in there...
找出随便一双可以穿的鞋子012---...and pick out any shoes that fit your feet.
我不管它是否搭配  我不管它是否会…012---I don't care if they match. I don't care if they make...
让你的脚踝  膝盖或耳垂看起来胖胖的  快去吧012---...your ankles or your knees or your earlobes look fat. Just do it!
进房间  挑出要穿的  然后我们就可以走了012---Go in there, pick something out so we can go.
好吧  谢谢012---All right. Thank you.
我要打给蜜雪儿  确定那是她的声音012---I've got to call Michelle to see if that was her voice.
没错  那就是她的声音012---It was. It was her voice.
摩妮卡  我想你又开始偏执了012---Monica, I think you've gone over to the bad place.
喂012---Hola.
喂012---Hello? Hello?
好  那是她的声音  对吗  绝对是  对啊012---Okay. That was her, right? Definitely. Yeah.
这样就解决啦012---So there you go. Whew!
我们的危险解除啦  我要去换衣服了012---We're out of the woods. I think I'll get dressed now.
我来接  好012---I'll get it. Okay.
你好  摩妮卡与瑞秋的家012---Hi, Monica and Rachel's.
好  请稍等  请问你是哪位012---Yeah, just a second. Can I ask who's calling?
是蜜雪儿012---Ooh! It's Michelle! Ooh!
她一定装了来电显示功能  你也该去装一个012---She must have that "caller I.D." thing. You should get that.
蜜雪儿012---Michelle?
对  就是我  我不小心拨了你的电话012---Yeah, that was me. I dialed your number by mistake.
只要试着…012---Just try to be...
你真的好甜..012---You're so sweet.
是啊  我们曾经是一对很好的情侣012---Yeah, we were a great couple.
我知道  我真的很想他012---I know, I really miss him.
你了解的  就像是012---Well, you know how it is. It's just that...
你知道奇怪的是什么012---You know what's weird?
唐老鸭从来不穿裤子012---Donald Duck never wore pants.
但是当他洗完澡出来…012---But when he gets out of the shower...
他总是在腰间围上一条毛巾012---...he always puts a towel around his waist.
我是说  那算什么012---I mean, what is that about?
蜜雪儿  我只是进入信箱  来听我自己的留官012---I only beeped in so I could hear my own message.
那样说得过去吧012---I mean, that's allowed.
我真的希望你别告诉你爸…012---I would really appreciate it if you wouldn't tell your dad about...
你说你不爽是什么意思  我们是朋友啊012---What do you mean, you don't feel comfortable with this? We're friends!
那个小婊子根本就讨厌我012---That bitch always hated me.
我要再打给她  别…012---I'm calling her back. No, no, no! Tick, tick, tick.
好吧  好012---Okay, fine. Okay.
她房间里有电话吧  好  我们来处理吧012---She's got a phone in there, right? Okay, we're on it.
我知道单子上写〝打不打领带都没关系〞012---I know it says, "black tie optional"...
但你这样好像过于随便了012---...but this may be pushing it a little.
我不去了012---I'm not gonna go.
你不去了012---You're not gonna go?
不  我想更新我的通讯录012---No, I think I'm gonna catch up on my correspondence.
你怎么可以不去呢012---How can you not be going?
我就是不去了012---I'm not gonna go.
我想这样就表明了〝我不去〞的意思012---So I think that will accomplish the "not going."
我只是好奇…012---Um, you know, just out of curiosity...
自从你在我朋友面前羞辱我  又对我大吼012---Ever since I was humiliated and yelled at in front of my friends...
我就没有情绪去参加什么博物馆的慈善会了012---...I'm just, I don't know, not in a very museum benefit-y kind of mood.
好…天啊  很抱歉  我对你大吼大叫  对不起012---Right. Well, okay. Okay. God, I'm sorry. I'm sorry I yelled.
没关系  可是你在生气012---That's fine. No, but you're mad.
我没有生气  我只是不去了012---I'm not mad. I'm just not going.
没错  好吧012---Right. Okay.
你知道我一定要去吧012---You know that I have to go, right? Mm-hm.
那这样会不会变成  我在你难过时离你而去012---So is it gonna be like I'm abandoning you while you're upset?
不  不012---No. No?
我对你大吼  你不难过 对  还包括你的羞辱012---You're not upset about the yelling. Right. And the humiliating.
当然  还有羞辱012---Well, of course, the humiliating.
那么012---So we...
我们之间没问题012---...we're okay?
我们没问题  对012---We're good.  Right.
亲爱的  我爱你  是的  罗斯012---Honey? I love you. Yes, Ross.
把电话放下012---Get away from that phone!
她已经开始换衣服了012---She's just getting dressed now.
我居然因此而兴奋  我是不是有问题012---Is it wrong that I was totally aroused by that?
好啦  兄弟  就是这样啦012---Okay, buddy boy, here it is.
你把我衣服藏起来  我就把你所有的衣服穿上012---You hide my clothes. I'm wearing everything you own.
天啊012---Oh, my God!
这算什么与藏人家内裤相反的事012---That is so not the opposite of taking somebody's underwear!
你看看我  我是钱德012---Look at me! I'm Chandler.
我还能再多穿一件衣服吗012---Could I be wearing any more clothes?
或许我不该不穿内裤的…012---Maybe if I wasn't going commando...
