我的容器很可爱   却似乎空空如也012---My vessel so lovely With nothing inside
真正面对面接触后   果然空无一物012---Now that I've touched you You seem emptier still
他觉得摩妮卡很没深度   像空瓶子一样012---He thinks Monica's empty. She's the empty vase.
诗真的这意思吗   绝对是012---You really think that's what he meant?  Totally.

忠心耿耿又爱你的罗斯012---Your loyal, loving boyfriend, Ross Ross!

你竟然说我送你那些东西  除了爱意以外别有用心012---...that you'd think I'd send you those things out of anything other than love.
心好痛012---Hurt.
心好痛  好啦  我懂了  我伤到你了012---Hurt. All right, Ross, I get it. You're hurt.
难道男友现在不可以请四重唱  到女友办公室唱歌了吗012---Can't a guy send a barbershop quartet to his girlfriend's office anymore?
拜托  罗斯  这用意也太明显了012---Oh, please. Ross, it was so obvious.
根本就像在划地盘012---It was like you were marking your territory.
你干脆直接到我办公桌旁  撒泡尿好了012---I mean, you might as well have just come in and peed all around my desk.
我才不会这样012---I would never do that.
我很清楚你在搞什么把戏  好吗012---Look, I know what's going on here, okay?
马克都解释给我听了  他说男人都这样搞的012---Mark explained it all to me. He said this is what you guys do.
要是马克这么跟你说  那他真笨012---Yeah, well, if Mark said that, then Mark's an idiot.
马克真是天才012---Mark's a genius.
怎么说  他怎会是天才  你们不懂这是怎么回事吗012---Why? How? How is he a genius? Look, don't you see what's happening?
他不直接追她  却装作是她的知心闺蜜012---Instead of hitting on her right away, he's becoming her confidant.
现在她就会跑去跟他抱怨你012---Now he's gonna be the guy that she goes to to complain about you.
我怎么办012---What am I gonna do?
何不送她一个音乐金龟012---Well, why don't you send her a musical bug?

好  啥都别做  就坐这跟我们聊天012---Fine, don't do anything. Just sit here and talk to us.
同时她可能在跟他抱怨你  他则扮演推心置腹的好朋友角色012---Meanwhile, she is talking to him about you. And he's being Mr. Joe-Sensitive.
她开始会觉得或许  "这才是我要的人  因为他懂我"012---She starts thinking, "Maybe this is the guy for me because he understands me."
不知不觉之间  她已经跟他在一起了012---And before you know it, she's with him.
到时候你就只能  唉声叹气了012---And you'll be all, "Oh, man."
他却是痛快极了012---And he'll be all, "Yes!"
而我们只能说   傻瓜012---And us, we'll be like, "Oh, dude."
很快你就只能012---And pretty soon you'll be like:
嗨012---"Hi."
说着 "我不能去  瑞秋和马克可能也会到"012---And, "Well, I can't go. Rachel and Mark might be there."
我们会说 "别放在心上  都四年了"012---And we'll be like, "Man, get over it. It's been four years."

他的感情触礁了  所以没法脱身012---He's having a relationship crisis and can't get out of Long Island.
这表示面试取消了吗012---So does that mean the audition's off?
乔伊  既然你是这里最有经验的人012---Listen, Joey, seeing as you've got the most experience...
就由你来教其他舞者舞步012---...I want you to take these dancers and teach them the combination.
什么012---What?
乔伊  拜托  这很简单012---Oh, Joey, come on, it's easy.

对012---Yeah.
我不过是只没有内涵的瓶子  是吗  什么012---So I'm just an empty vase, huh?  What?
我是没读过什么名著012---So I don't read as many important books as you do.
也不会写些指桑骂槐的诗012---I don't write poems that seem to be about one thing but are about something else.
而且我又很容易  对平凡事物就心动012---And you know what? I get excited about stupid stuff...
像是礼拜六《时人杂志》送来时012---...like when my People magazine comes on Saturday...
新的《应有尽有》目录寄来时012---...and the new Hold Everything catalog.
但那不表示  我没有内涵012---But that does not mean I'm empty.

再按一下   又有穿了012---And then you click it again and she's dressed.
这下是事业女强人  走在大街上012---She's a business woman, walking down the street.
购物   然后又没穿了012---She's window shopping, and, oh, oh, oh, she's naked.
你好012---Hi.
你好012---Hello.
我想跟我的笔独处一下012---You know what? I'm gonna spend some alone time with the pen.
抱歉   我真蠢012---I'm sorry. I was an idiot.
大白痴  大白痴012---A big idiot. A big idiot. Heh.
只是  请你理解  马克这事  我就是无法释怀012---It's just, you have to realize, this whole Mark thing is really hard for me.
亲爱的  怎会无法释怀  我们都在一起快一年了012---Honey, why is it hard? We've been together for almost a year now.
我之前跟卡萝在一起八年  都还是分了012---Well, I was with Carol for like eight years, and I lost her.
而对你   我似乎爱得更多012---And now, if it's possible, I think I love you even more.
所以我不由得会往坏处想012---So it's hard for me to believe I'm not gonna...
总觉得有人会抢走你012---Well, that someone else isn't gonna take you away.
让我当那个人012---Let it be me. Let it be me.
亲爱的  你这话好动人012---Honey, that's very sweet.
但我是这么想  两个人如果真心相爱012---It just seems to me, though, that if two people love each other...
又互相信赖  跟我们一样012---...and trust each other, like we do...
那就没必要吃醋012---...there's no reason to be jealous.
我要走了  再见  钱德012---I gotta get going. Bye, Chandler.
好   罗斯012---Oh, okay, Ross.
这笔有点无聊了  帮我买些色情书刊好吗012---Listen, this pen's getting kind of boring, so can you pick me up some porn?
你去哪   我去接小班012---Where you going? I've gotta go pick up Ben.
跟他约好了  下午要陪他玩012---We've got a playdate this afternoon.
还有谁012---Oh. With who?
就昨晚在派对上  认识的女孩012---Just this woman I met last night at the party.
有女孩012---There was a woman at?
是说脱衣女郎012---The stripper?
对012---Yeah.
你跟脱衣女郎有约012---You have a playdate with a stripper?
还真该弄个小孩来012---Man, I gotta get a kid.
对啊012---Uh, yeah, yeah.
就她那个以后  我们就聊开了012---We started talking after she, you know, did her thing...
刚好她也有个儿子  跟小班一样年纪012---...and it turns out she's got a boy about Ben's age.
所以我们要一起带去  上儿童体操课012---So we're gonna take the kids to a Gymboree class.
可以吗  当然  她结婚没012---Is that okay? Sure. Is she married?
没012---No. Huh.
你在吃醋吗012---Are you jealous?
没啊  只是不懂她  非找你不可而已012---No. You know, I just don't see why she has to play with you, that's all.
难道她没有012---I mean, doesn't she, you know...
其它一样做脱衣舞的朋友吗012---...have any other stripper-mom friends of her own?
你明明就是在吃醋  我没在吃醋  好吗012---You are totally jealous. Ugh. I'm not jealous, all right?
这是跟…012---This is about...
人们对某种…012---...um, people feeling certain things...
像是…012---...you know, about...
对脱衣女郎的感受012---...strippers. - Oh.
而且   亲爱的  我也爱你012---And, you know... And, um... I... Ugh. Honey, I love you too.
再见  等等012---Bye. Wait, wait, wait.
哈012---What?
这吻他肯定好几小时  忘不了012---Well, there's a kiss he won't forget for a few hours, you know?
对012---Yeah. Ha, ha.
不然的话就是你引起他的性欲  再把他送到脱衣女郎手上012---Either that or you just turned him on and sent him off to a stripper.
这里有位叫胡立欧的吗012---Is there a Julio here?
我就是012---I am Julio.
做作先生012---Mr. Pretentious
你自以为了不起012---You think there's no one finer
你的诗卖不出去  只能在餐馆上班012---Well, your poems are unpublished And you work in a diner
你也不是上帝赐给女人的礼物  全是你的想像012---You're no God's gift to women. That's all in your head
你不过是个浑球012---You are just a butt-munch
浑球惹人厌012---No one likes a butt-munch.
床上表现也很差012---And you're also bad in bed
