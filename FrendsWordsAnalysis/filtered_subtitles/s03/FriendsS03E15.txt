我们处得非常好012---...and you're getting along really great...

我不知道012---No.
嘿   嘿012---Hey. Hey.
瑞秋在房里吗012---What, is, uh, Rach in her room?
她还在上班  但她要我请你打电话给她012---Oh. No, she's still at work, but she told me to tell you to call her.
什么  她要取消跟我的约会   她怎么能那么做012---Oh, what? Is she gonna cancel on me again? How could she do this?
她不知道  今天是我们的周年纪念日吗012---Doesn't she know it's our anniversary?
好吧  罗斯  我对这件事的了解仅止于此012---All right, uh, Ross, this is the extent of my knowledge on the subject.

甜心  真的很抱歉  看起来整晚我得要加班了012---Honey, I'm so sorry, but it looks like I'm gonna be here all night.
什么  何不让我过去呢012---What? Well, um, how about I come up there?
不  甜心  拜托  我有很多事要处理012---No, no, no, honey, please. I just have too much to deal with.
总之今晚我要跟赛吉约会012---Anyway, I'm going out with Sergei again tonight, and, um...
你能过来跟翻译约会吗012---Could you come and be the translator's date?
我们独处时  你们两个可以溜掉012---So that when we... You know, it's time for our alone time, you two can split off?
他有点可爱012---You know, he's kind of cute.
你是说  他真的很可爱012---"Kind of cute" like, "really kind of cute"?
或跟你的朋友"走后门赖利"一样可爱012---Or "kind of cute" like your friend Spackle-Back Larry?
别那样叫他012---Hey, don't call him that.
他叫做"走后门哈利"012---His name is Spackle-Back Harry.
你知道吗  或许我们该出发了012---Hey, you know what? Maybe we should get going.
可洛要我们几点到012---I mean, what time did Chloe say to get there?
十点半   现在几点012---Uh, 10:30. What time is it now?
四点半012---Four-thirty.
好吧  我们再待一会  对012---Yeah, all right. So we'll hang out. Yeah.
还记得她提过  我们能三人行的事吗012---Hey, remember when she brought up that thing about the three of us?
对  我记得可清楚了012---Yes, vividly.
她是在开玩笑的吧   我想是的012---She was kidding about that, right? Yeah, I think so.
我想应该是的012---Yeah, I think so.
天啊  如果今晚真的发生那种事  还蛮奇怪的012---God, it'd be weird if that situation presented itself tonight, huh?
没错  我是说…012---Yeah. Yeah, I mean, uh...
我们该怎么做呢012---...what would we do?
兄弟  我不知道012---Ha, ha. Dude, I don't know. Ha-ha-ha.
她是开玩笑的  对012---She was kidding. Yeah.
她是…012---She was...
为了以防万一  我们该制订规则012---Just in case, we should come up with a set of ground rules.
对  没错012---Yeah. For sure.
好吧  第一条规则应该是012---Okay. You probably want the first one to be:
千万别张开眼睛012---"Never open your eyes."
你知道吗   因为你不会希望在做的时候012---You know? Because you don't want to be doing something...
抬头往上看吧012---...and then look up, right?
看到你不想看的事012---And see something that you don't want to be seeing.
对  好点子  太棒了012---Yeah. Good call. Nice.
等一下…012---Hold it. Hold it.
如果我闭上眼睛012---What if my eyes are closed, and...
我的手在那里012---And my hand is out there...
好吧  一定要张开眼睛012---Aah! Okay, eyes open at all times.
喔  嘿012---Oh, hey.
我们如何决定我们该…012---How do we decide where we, ahem...
各自应该在…012---...you know, each would, ahem, you know...
哪个位置  对012---...be? - Right. Right.
我们可以丢铜板决定012---Well, you know, we could flip for it.
我想是吧  但正反面怎么分012---I guess. But, like, what's heads and what's tails?
如果你连那个都不知道  我不想跟你一起做这件事012---Well, if you don't know that, then I don't want to do this with you.
不  我正看着订单012---No, no, no. I am looking at a purchase order right here...
上面写得很清楚  我们订了蔚蓝海岸比基尼012---...and it clearly states that we ordered the Riviera bikini...
不同的尺寸跟颜色012---...in a variety of sizes and colors and...
这跟我穿什么有关系吗012---What does it matter what I'm wearing?
我能跟你的上司谈一谈吗  谢谢  我愿意等012---Could I please speak to your supervisor? Thank you. We're holding.
嗨012---Hi. Oh!
天啊  你来这里做什么012---My God. What are you doing here?

你带了野餐过来  超棒的男朋友012---You brought a picnic. Ugh. What a boyfriend.
够了  星期一我要开始化妆012---That's it. On Monday, I start wearing makeup.
罗斯  真的太棒了  但我得处理危机012---Ross, honey, this is very nice, but I've got a crisis.
对  但我准备了北非小米012---Yeah, but I've got couscous.
甜心  抱歉  我知道今天是我们的周年纪念日012---Honey. Honey, I'm sorry. I know it's our anniversary...
我在电话里说过  我没时间停下来012---...but I told you on the phone I don't have time to stop.
好吧  你不必停下来  我是隐形人  就当我不在这里012---Okay, you don't have to stop. I'm invisible. I'm not here.
对  可是我…012---Yeah, but I don't...
谁批准那笔订单的012---Who approved that order?
但我没有同事叫做马克罗宾森012---Well, there is no Mark Robinson in this office.
帮我打电话给马克  我爱马克  你认识马克吗012---Get me Mark on the phone. Ugh. I love Mark. Do you know Mark?
当然   我得查一下手边的资料012---Yeah. Let me check that with what I've got here.
好吧  038不是本店代码  038是亚特兰大的代码012---All right, see, 038 is not the number for this store. Zero-three-eight is Atlanta.
要胡椒吗012---Heh. Pepper?
我不要  好吧  抱歉012---None for me. Okay, sorry. Whoo.
抱歉  我说过分店代码搞错了012---I'm sorry. As I was saying, the store number is wrong.
对不起  可是…天啊012---And I'm sorry, but... Oh, my God!
好了  没事了012---Okay. It's fine.
太棒了012---Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
对不起  我再回你电话012---Excuse me, I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to call you back.
我办公室来了个疯子012---I've got Shemp in my office.
你在做什么  对不起012---What are you doing? I'm sorry.
有人挂掉电话了012---But, um, hey, oh, somebody's off the phone.
要不要在火边来杯酒  我可以再生一次火012---How about a glass of wine by the fire? I can get it going again...
罗斯  你没在听  我没时间停下来012---Ross, you're not listening. I don't have time to stop.
少来了  你连十分钟都没有  我没有十分钟012---Come on, you don't have 10 minutes? I don't have 10 minutes.
苏菲  她没有十分钟吗  罗斯  我说过我没有时间012---Sophie, does she have 10 minutes? Hey, Ross. I told you, I don't.
别对我大叫  好吗  这是整个星期我们见面最久的一次012---Don't yell at me, okay? This is the most I've seen you all week.
听着  现在我没空跟你说  我得在时限内完成工作012---Look, I cannot do this right now, okay? I've got a deadline.
你能回家吗  我们晚点再谈012---Would you just go home? I'll talk to you later.
对   等一下  再见012---Yeah, but wait... Goodbye.
那是我们的打洞机012---Uh, actually, that's our three-hole punch.
嘿   嗨012---Hey. Hi.
听着  之前发生的事012---Look, um, about what happened earlier...
我完全了解  你压力很大012---Whoa. I completely understand. You were stressed.
我会给你机会跟我道歉012---I was gonna give you a chance to apologize to me.
为什么  因为我让你  在你的办公室对我发脾气012---For what? For letting you throw me out of your office?
你无权跑到我的办公室  罗斯012---You had no right coming down to my office, Ross.
你不能带着野餐篮  跑到别人的办公室012---You do not bring a picnic basket to somebody's work...
除非他们是公园巡警012---...unless maybe they were a park ranger.
对  请原谅我想跟女朋友  一起庆祝我们的周年纪念日012---Yeah, well, excuse me for wanting to be with my girlfriend on our anniversary.
天啊  我真是个大混蛋012---Boy, what an ass am I.
但是我说过我没时间  对  你总是没时间012---But I told you I didn't have the time.Yeah, well, you never have the time.
我是说  我觉得我不像有女朋友了012---I mean, I don't feel like I have a girlfriend anymore.
罗斯  你要我怎么做012---Ross, what do you want from me?
你要我辞掉工作  让你觉得你有女朋友012---You want me to quit my job so you can feel like you have a girlfriend?
不  或许是个好点子  你得了解那只是一份工作012---No. But it would nice if you'd realize that it's just a job.
只是一份工作012---Just a job?
对012---Yes.
罗斯  你知道这是我一生中第一次  我在做我在乎的事吗012---Ross, do you realize this is the first time in my life I'm doing something I care about?
这是我一生中第一次  在做我拿手的事吗012---This is the first time in my life I'm doing something I'm actually good at?
如果你无法了解012---I mean, if you don't get that...
我了解  好吗  我了解  也为你感到开心012---No, hey, I get that. Okay? I get that and I'm happy for you.
但我厌倦了跟你的答录机谈恋爱012---I'm tired of having a relationship with your answering machine.
我不想再那么做了  我也是012---I don't know what to do anymore. Well, neither do I.
这跟马克有关吗012---Is this about Mark?
天啊  好吧  跟他无关012---Oh, my God. Okay, it's not.
我的天啊012---Oh, my God.
我不能老是跟你为同一件事情吵架   罗斯012---I cannot keep having this same fight over and over again, Ross.
不  你让我受不了012---No, you're making this too hard.
我让你受不了  你要我怎么做012---I'm making this too hard? What do you want me to do?
我不知道  我不知道012---I don't know. I don't know.
听着  或许我们该休息一下012---Look, ugh, maybe we should just take a break.
好吧  你说的对012---Okay, okay. Fine. You're right.
我们休息一下  让自己冷静下来012---Let's, uh... Let's take a break. Let's cool off, okay?
我们去吃冷冻优格吧012---Let's get some frozen yogurt or something.
不是012---No.
我们该分手了012---A break from us.
过去五年来   装订有了很大的进步012---And the advances in collating in the past five years.
我们刚刚买了一部X5000012---I mean, we just got in an X-5000, you know?
X5000让X50  看起来像T71012---The X-5000 makes an X-50 look like a T-71.
恐龙先生来了012---Hey, it's the dinosaur guy.
嗨  罗斯  可洛012---Hi, Ross. Oh, hi, Chloe.
我跟你介绍一下我的朋友012---I want you to meet some friends of mine.
这家伙是我的英雄  他拿着资料过来012---This guy's my hero. He comes in with some stuff...
要我们放大四倍012---...he wants it blown up 400 percent.
我们说我们办不到  他说非得这么做不可012---We say we don't do that. He says, "You gotta."
你们知道吗  我们办到了012---And you know what? We did it.
现在有人要放大资料四倍  我们都会说"罗斯影印来罗"012---And now any time anybody wants 400, we just say, "Let's Ross it."
而且只有一种颜色012---And that's the only color that comes in.
可洛  你有铜板借我  我要买保险套012---Yo, Chloe. Do you have a quarter for the condom machine?
你来这里做什么012---So, what are you doing here?
我以为今晚你们要去吃晚餐  庆祝周年纪念日012---I thought tonight was your big anniversary dinner.
对  计划有变  我们决定分手012---Yeah, a little change of plans. Uh, we're gonna break up instead.
我会说一点法文012---Oh, and I can also speak a little French.
为什么  我说了什么012---Why? What did I say?
你问我今晚要不要跟你上床012---Well, you just asked if I wanted to go to bed with you tonight.
天啊012---Oh, my God.Heh.
难怪我在墨利斯咖啡厅  得到这么好的服务012---No wonder I get such great service at Cafe Maurice.
等一下012---Knock, knock, knock.
你能告诉赛吉我很喜欢012---Hi. Um, could you please tell Sergei that, um, I was fascinated...
布特罗斯盖里  在《纽约时报》发表的言论吗012---...by what Boutros Boutros-Ghali said in the New York Times?
你没提到布特罗斯盖里012---You didn't say, "Boutros Boutros-Ghali."
布特罗斯盖里012---Boutros Boutros-Ghali.
他说他也是012---He says he was too.
真有趣012---Interesting.
我还蛮好奇的012---Uh, so I was wondering...
在你们又聊起来之前012---Before you get all talky again...
你能告诉赛吉012---...um, could you also please tell Sergei...
我很喜欢他的西装吗012---...that I really like his suit.
他说谢谢  今晚你也很漂亮012---Uh, he said, "Thank you very much. You look very pretty tonight.
你的头发跟阳光一样闪亮  你是厨师吗012---Your hair, golden like the sun." So you're a chef?
我考虑自己开家餐厅012---I'm also thinking of opening up my own restaurant.
真的吗  摩妮卡012---Oh, really? Monica...
我们能在菜单后面谈一谈吗012---...could I talk to you behind my menu, please?
你在做什么  我在聊天012---What are you doing? Well, I was having a conversation.
但米夏对你非常有兴趣012---Yeah, but Mischa's so interested in you...
赛吉跟我却没办法说话012---...that Sergei and I haven't been able to say two words to each other.
你要我呆坐在这里  听你们三个聊天012---What do you want me to do? Sit here while the three of you have a conversation?
那就真的太棒了  谢谢012---That would be great. Thank you.
喂  嗨  我是马克012---Hello? Oh, hi. It's Mark.
什么  我有口臭吗012---Oh. What? Is it my breath?

我不饿  是我要吃的012---Oh, yeah, I'm not hungry. It's for me.
好的  再见012---Okay. Bye.
你打算怎么办  我能做什么012---So, what'll you do?  What can I do?
对方要分手  你只能接受012---One person wants to break up, you break up.
不行  你们不一样  打电话跟她谈一谈012---Hey, no way. Come on, this is you guys. Call her and work it out.
少来了  我们刚刚大吵一架  我不能等一下再打吗012---Come on. We just had this huge fight. Don't I have to wait a while?
这又不是吃完饭后不能游泳  快去打电话012---Hey, this isn't like swimming after you eat. Pick up your phone.
吃完东西后不能游泳是个迷思012---You know that whole swimming thing is a myth.
对  跟我的蓝尼叔叔说吧012---Yeah, tell that to my Uncle Lenny.
为什么  他怎么了012---Why? What happened to him?
没事  他只是相信那套说法012---Nothing. He just really believes in that.
然后我们愚蠢地大吵了一架   真的很可怕012---Ugh. And then we got into this big, stupid fight... It was awful.
我跟他说他把我当成公园巡警012---I told him he treats me like a park ranger, something, ugh...
后来…012---And then...
我跟他说我要分手012---...I told him I wanted to take a break.
我不想分手012---I don't want to take a break.
我很遗憾012---Well, I'm sorry.
春卷  不要012---Egg roll? No.
然后我打电话给他   他不在012---And then I called him, and he wasn't there.
或许他只是出去了012---He's probably just out.
谢谢  那真的帮了我一个大忙   我很高兴你来了012---Oh, thank you. That's very helpful. I'm glad you came over.
