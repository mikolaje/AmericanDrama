因为我会  但是我妈不会012---Because I can and my mom couldn't.
我想那一定是来自我们爸爸的遗传012---And I thought, you know... I figured that was something I got from our dad.
等一下  你是说这么做012---Well, wait, you mean like this?  Yeah.
对  你也会012---Yeah, you can do it too. Yeah.
你没有卷啊012---You're not doing it.
好吧  所以是我妈会  我不会012---Oh, right, okay. Yeah, my mom could and I can't.

你筛选出谁了012---All right. Who you got it narrowed down to?
好  伊丽莎白赫莉012---Okay. Ahem. Elizabeth Hurley.
很迷人  是啊012---Ooh, very attractive. Yeah.
宽容012---Forgiving.
苏珊莎兰登012---Susan Sarandon.

她可能会叫你先捐四罐食品罐头012---She probably wouldn't let you do it unless you donated four cans of food first.
还有伊莎贝拉罗塞里尼012---And Isabella Rossellini.
很辣  很性感012---Ooh. Ooh. Very hot. Very sexy.
但是太国际化了  她不会待在你身边的012---But, uh, you know, she's too international. She's never gonna be around.
所以呢  所以你得挑可能性大一点的012---So? So you gotta play the odds.
找一个会一直在国内的人012---Pick somebody who's gonna be in the country, like, all the time.
对啊  你之所以搞不定伊莎贝拉  因为地理因素012---Yeah. Because that's why you won't get Isabella Rossellini. Geography.
你说的烧就真的是烧012---Okay, so by "melting," you meant melting.
是啊012---Yeah.

那是他瞎掰的012---He just makes it up. Hmm.
你们处得怎样   到目前为止很糟012---So how's it going with you guys? So far it kind of blows.
我以为他会更有弟弟的威觉012---I don't know, I just thought, you know, that he'd feel more like a brother.
就像你和罗斯   亲密融洽012---Like you and Ross. Just close and connected and...
现在是很亲  但是你不会相信  在以前…012---Oh. We're close now, but you wouldn't believe the years...
我们又吵又打  又拉又扯012---...of noogies and wedgies and flying wedgies and atomic wedgies and...
然后裙子就会被扯到头上来012---That's when the waistband actually goes over your head.
嗯012---Ah.
我们还用影子游戏去烦对方012---We drove each other crazy playing the shadow game.
怎么玩影子游戏   怎么玩影子游戏012---How do you play the shadow game? How do you play the shadow game?
我在问你啊  我在问你啊012---I just asked you. I just asked you.
我没空跟你闹012---I don't have time for this.
这个游戏就是这么玩  你放弃得真快012---No, that is what the game is. Well, you just gave up really quickly.
有看到乔伊吗  怎么了012---Have you seen Joey? What's the matter?
就是这个012---Oh, just this.
其实是我不好  沙发就是用来放亮光漆的012---It's my fault, really, because the couch is where we usually keep the varnish.
谁把瓷砖拿给我012---Hey, somebody wanna hand me one of those tiles?
发生什么事   他在帮我重铺地板012---What's going on? He's retiling my floor.
喂  你这个泥水匠012---Yo, spackle boy.
给我起来  你要有始有终012---Get up.  Ah-ah. You started this, you will finish it.

对不起  我得去工作012---Um, I'm really sorry, but I have to go into work.
我的一个固定客户  他坚持要让我做012---It's one of my regulars. He's insisting that I do him, so...
你在做什么工作012---Hey, what kind of work do you do? Oh.
我是按摩师  我帮客人按摩012---I'm a masseuse. I give people massages and stuff.
你在那种按摩院工作012---You work at one of those massage parlors?
我们不那样叫  不过没错012---Well, you know, we don't call it that. But, yeah.
好劲爆012---Whoa, that's wild.
我完全不知道012---No, I had no idea. Ha-ha-ha.

一  二012---One, two...
为什么不直接到二就好012---Why don't we just go on two?
为什么是二   因为这样比较快012---Why two? Because it's faster.
要不是你废话  早就数到三了012---Yeah, I could've counted to three four times without all this two talk.
好  但是以后…  好了  不要废话  这东西没变轻012---All right, but in the future... - Okay. Heavy thing not getting lighter.

可能是我的尺有问题012---Maybe my ruler's wrong.
可能所有的尺都有问题012---Maybe all the rulers are wrong.
还不算太差吧012---Look, it's not that bad.
那又怎样  挡你的门一点点  我的一点点012---So what? It blocks a little of your door, a little of my door.
我有更好的主意012---I got a better idea.
干脆不要挡我的门  都去挡你的门012---How about it blocks none of my door and a lot of your door?
先说一声  这边油漆未干012---Listen, before I forget, that side is still wet.

搞不好012---Yeah, maybe.
骗人012---Oh, heh. You lie.
你不认为我会行动012---You don't think I'd go up to her?
