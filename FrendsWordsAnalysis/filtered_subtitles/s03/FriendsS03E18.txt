什么事那么好笑012---What's so funny?
没事  我在练习演戏  我只是在练习假笑012---Oh, nothing. It's an acting exercise. I'm practicing my fake laugh.
怎么了  什么事那么好笑012---What? What's so funny?
喔  不…012---Oh, no, no.
不  这里禁烟012---No, no. There's none of that in here.
少来了  至少让我抽完最后一根012---Oh, come on. At least let me finish this last one.
好吧  除非你让我抽一口012---Okay, but only if you give me a drag.
好吧012---Okay.
该死  我又屈服在自己的欲望下012---Oh, dark mother, once again I suckle at your smoky teat.
那根就给你抽了012---Why don't you hold on to that one.
那是最不好玩的游戏012---That's, like, the least fun game ever.
我厌倦了你的抽烟习惯  所以我带了一样东西012---I'm sick of your smoking, so I brought something...
可以帮你戒烟012---...that is going to help you quit.
这个戒烟贴片没用012---That patch is no good.
这是催眠录音带012---It's a hypnosis tape.
我的女同事听了两星期  再也没抽过烟012---A woman at work used it for two weeks and hasn't smoked since.
你有什么问题012---What's your problem?
没事  我只是觉得催眠完全是在胡扯012---Nothing. It's just that hypnosis is beyond crap.
罗斯  我看过你在大西洋城被催眠012---I watched you get hypnotized in Atlantic City.
那家伙没有催眠我  好吗012---That guy did not hypnotize me, okay?
原来你常常脱掉裤子表演擦屁股012---You always pull your pants down and play "Wipe Out" on your butt.
别提催眠了012---Forget hypnosis.
想戒烟就得在石南花田里裸舞012---The way to quit smoking is to dance naked in a field of heather...
跟六名健康年轻男子   一起畅快地流汗012---...and then bathe in the sweat of six healthy young men.
或是我爸打电话到《周四夜》012---Or what my father calls "Thursday night."

拿去吧  我不要加肉桂012---Here you go. I didn't want cinnamon on this.
抱歉012---Sorry.
嗨  天啊  法兰克012---Hi. Hi. Oh, my God! Frank!
你好吗  你来这里做什么012---Ha, ha. Hi. How are you? What are you doing here?
我该打电话给你的  但我把你的电话号码搞丢了012---I would've called, but I lost your number.
我妈把我锁在屋外  所以我没办法去找电话号码012---And then, uh, my mom locked me out of the house, so I couldn't find it.
我试着找公用电话012---And, uh, then I tried to find a pay phone
但话筒被剪断了012---and the receiver was cut off.
发生了什么事012---What happened?
有人破坏公物012---Uh, oh. Vandalism.
还有  你跟你妈怎么了012---But also, what happened between you and your mom?
我们大吵一架  因为她说我太幼稚  不该结婚012---We got in a fight. She said that I was too immature to get married.
你要结婚了  对012---You're getting married? Oh, yeah.
我弟弟要结婚了012---My little brother's getting married! Ha, ha.
我就知道你会很开心012---I knew you'd be so cool about this.
你要跟她见面吗012---Uh, hey, do you wanna meet her?
我要吗012---Do I?
你要吗012---Do you?
我当然要012---Yeah, I do.
酷啊  好吧  她正在停车012---Cool, all right. She's just parking the truck.
我去叫我未婚妻进来012---I'm gonna... I'm gonna go get my, uh, my fiancee, man!
我赌他是我们之中第一个结婚的人012---I'd have bet good money that he'd be the first one of us to get married.
这不是很棒吗012---Isn't it fantastic?
对  但你不觉得他还太小  不该结婚吗012---Yeah, but don't you think he's a little young to get married?
什么  他18岁了  他在自己的单身派对上喝酒012---What? He's 18. It'll be illegal for him to drink...
是犯法的012---...at his own bachelor party.
对  也不能召妓012---Yeah, or to get a hooker.
那本来就是犯法的  乔伊012---Always illegal, Joe.
嘿012---Hey! Hey!
她是我的未婚妻012---This is, uh, my fiancee...
奈特老师012---...Mrs. Knight. Ha-ha-ha.
她是我姐姐  这真的很有趣012---That's my sister. You know, it's funny.
法兰克常跟我提起你  但你跟我想像中完全不一样012---Frank told me so much about you, but you're not how I pictured you at all.
对  我非常讶异012---Yeah, I'm a big surprise.
请坐  来吧  坐下012---Here you go. Here, grab a seat. Oh.
你们是怎么认识的012---So how did you guys meet?
我在奈特老师的…012---Well, um, I was in Mrs. Knight's...
我是说爱丽丝  抱歉  我常那么做012---I mean, Alice. Sorry. I always do that. Ha, ha.
我上她的家政课012---I was in her Home Ec class.
他是我最好的学生012---He was my best student.
她是我最好的老师012---She was my best teacher.
如果让学生不跷课  还有什么办法呢012---If that doesn't keep kids in school, what will?
所以你们要结婚了012---And so now you guys are gonna be married?
对012---Yeah. Ha, ha.
我们本来只考虑同居012---We talked about just living together, but, um...
但我们想快点生小孩012---...we wanna have kids right away.
天啊012---Oh, my God!
太棒了012---Great!
哇  生小孩  法兰克  你确定准备好了吗012---Wow, kids. Frank, are you sure you're ready for that?
有多难吗012---How hard can it be?
我是说宝宝  谁不想要宝宝  对吧012---You know, I mean, you know, babies. Who doesn't want babies? Right?
而且我一直没有父亲陪我012---And besides, I never had a dad around.
现在我有个父亲了  那就是我012---And now I always will, because it'll be me.
我们知道  我们的岁数差很多012---Really, we do realize that there's an age difference between us.
太好了  因为你看起来好像不知道的样子012---Good. Because you were acting like you didn't.
但在爱情里  年龄不是问题012---But when it comes to love, what does age matter?
你很快就睡着了012---You are falling fast asleep.
睡得很熟012---Deeper, deeper, deeper.
现在你完全睡着了012---You are now completely asleep.
你不需要抽烟012---You don't need to smoke.
香烟不能控制你012---Cigarettes don't control you.
你是坚强有自信的女人012---You are a strong, confident woman...
完全不需要抽烟012---...who does not need to smoke.
坚强有自信的女人012---A strong, confident woman.
你知道吗  我发现去年  我只跟理查及胡立欧约过会012---You know what? I realized in the last year I've only gone out with Richard and Julio.
你得帮帮我  帮我介绍男人  让我重享爱情的滋味012---You gotta help me out. Set me up. Get me back in the game.
应该不是问题  我在时尚界  常遇见单身异性恋男人012---Shouldn't be a problem. I work in fashion, and all I meet are eligible straight men.
还需要什么服务吗012---Can I get you something else?
我要起司蛋糕  还有你能跟我约会012---Cheesecake and a date, if you're giving them out.
我们不是谈过了吗012---Heh. Haven't we covered that topic?
你刚刚才跟她说…  你想跟我约会012---You just said to her... You wanna go out with me...
因为我的假发  大胸部  还会帮你上菜012---...because of my wig, the big boobs, and I serve you food.
如果是真的  我该跟我的萝丝阿姨约会012---If that were true, I'd be dating my Aunt Ruth.
我们出去过两次  真的很怪012---And the two times we went out, it was plain awkward.
你觉得她该跟我去约会  对吧012---You think she should go out with me, don't you?
我是说…012---Well, I mean...
你确定你要跟她约会吗012---...are you sure you wanna go out with her?
早上不会太好看  你知道我的意思吗012---That ain't a pretty picture in the morning, know what I mean?
假发都乱了  假胸挂在床头柜上012---That wig all in disarray, and boobs flung over the nightstand.
真的  好好考虑一下012---Really. Think about it.
我会的012---Oh, I will. Ha-ha-ha.
不  我知道这是法兰克的人生012---No, I know. I know that this is Frank's life.
你们知道吗012---You know?
我不想批评别人  但太变态了  也是不对的012---I don't wanna be judgmental, but it's sick. It's sick and wrong!
什么  年龄的关系吗012---What, is it the age thing?
不   我能接受年龄差距012---No, I'm fine with the age thing...
直到她把舌头伸进我弟弟的喉咙里012---...until it sticks its tongue down my brother's throat.
菲比  他似乎很喜欢012---Pheebs, he seems to enjoy it.
你们觉得他会喜欢忙着换尿布吗012---You think he'll enjoy it when he's up to his elbows in diapers...
因为他们必须立刻生孩子012---...of all the babies they have to have right away?
这对法兰克及宝宝都不公平012---This is not fair to Frank, and it's not fair to the babies.
你知道吗  这样的家政教育并不好012---You know what? It's not good home economics.
你跟他谈过吗012---Have you told him how you feel?
是的  但我没直说012---Yes. Not out loud.
如果你不跟他说  很快地他就会结婚  而你会恨你自己012---If you don't tell him, soon he'll be married, then you'll hate yourself.
对  如果我跟他说  他就会恨我012---Yeah, but if I do tell him, then he's gonna hate myself.
看看他跟他妈  我说不出口012---Look at him and his mom. I can't.
但是你们可以跟他谈谈  说服他放弃这个念头012---But you guys can. You talk him out of it.
不…012---No, no, no, no, no, no.
别这样  你们两个012---Come on, you guys.
你们没什么好损失的  我却会失去一切012---You have nothing to lose. I have everything to lose.
你们要我失去一切吗012---Do you want me to lose everything? Everything?
不要012---No.
好吧  我得去找法兰克012---Okay, I'm gonna go get Frank.
刚才走在街上  我转头跟你说012---We're walking down the street, and I turn to you and say:
"去脱衣酒吧坐坐" 还记得吗012---"Let's go hang out at Totally Nude Nudes." Remember?
然后你说 "我们还是去你家吧'012---And then, heh, you say, "Let's just hang out at your place."
很聪明啊  大傻瓜012---Well, that was a nice move, dumb-ass.
你应该跟这家伙约会012---I think you should go out with this guy.
不  他跟我完全不配012---No, he doesn't do anything for me.
上星期六晚上 《德州骑警》演到哪里了012---Last Saturday night, what happened on Walker, Texas Ranger?
德州骑警在找一整车的孩子012---Well, um, Walker was looking for this big busload of kids. Heh.
好吧  我了解你的意思012---All right, I get your point.
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
一年前我忘了手提包的密码012---I forgot the combination to this about a year ago.
我只是拎着装样子012---I just carry it around.
你有护唇膏吗  当然有012---You got any Chap Stick? Uh, yeah.
录音带有用吗012---Hey, how are those tapes working out?
非常有用  今天我还没有抽烟012---Pretty good. Good. I haven't smoked yet today.
我觉得非常棒  自信满满  好漂亮的上衣012---I feel great and confident. That is a stunning blouse.
谢谢012---Thank you.
拿去吧  谢谢012---Here you go. Thanks.
好吧  摩妮卡  给彼特一个机会 他既风趣  看起来还不错012---Okay, Mon. Let's give Pete a chance. He was funny. He seems really nice.
开支票的事真的很可爱012---That check thing was adorable.
什么支票012---What check thing?
开玩笑的  这个客人暗恋我  给了我两万块小费012---As a joke, this customer who has a crush on me, gave me a $20,000 tip.
他的电话号码在支票上  他要我打电话给他012---His number's on the check. He did it so I'd call.
彼特贝克  彼特…012---Pete Becker. Pete...
是他吗012---Is this him?
那是克林顿总统012---That's Bill Clinton.
他在拥抱谁012---Who's he hugging?
天啊  那是彼特  为什么总统要拥抱彼特012---Oh, my God. That's Pete. Why is Bill hugging Pete?
那家伙发明了摩斯865012---This guy invented Moss 865.
全世界所有办公室  都在使用那套程式012---Every office in the world uses that program.
我们就有用  没错012---We use it!  There you go!
天啊  摩妮卡要跟百万富翁约会012---Oh, my God. Monica's gonna go out with a millionaire.
不  我不要跟他约会  天啊012---No, I'm not gonna go out with him. Oh, my God.
我不敢相信  这是两万块支票  太令人兴奋了012---I can't believe this is a real $20,000 check. This is so exciting.
那是一种侮辱012---Or incredibly offensive.
当然  你说的对012---Yeah, sure. That too.
怎样012---What?
我们只是说  你不需要那么急012---All we're saying is, don't rush into anything.
没错  好好想一想  你18岁  她是44岁012---Come on, think about it. You're 18, okay? She's 44.
你36岁时  她会是88岁012---When you're 36, she's gonna be 88.
你以为我不知道吗012---You don't think I know that?
听着  重点是012---Look, the point is...
很多女人还没有跟你上过床012---...there's a lot of women you haven't had sex with yet.
对  他说的对  你的时代来了  你懂吗012---Yeah, he's right. He's right. This is your time, you know?
你年轻古怪  女人喜欢那样的男人012---You're young. You're weird. Chicks dig that.
但跟你喜欢的人上床  性爱的感觉不是更棒012---But isn't sex better when it's with one person that you really care about?
对  在诗里的确是的012---Yeah, in a poem, maybe.
不  他说的对  以前我跟瑞秋就是那样012---No, the man's right. That's what I had with Rachel.
现在不一样了012---You don't have it anymore?
不  我跟别人上床012---No, I, uh... I slept with someone else.
等一下  难道那样会让生活变得更美好012---So wait. So how did that make things better?
的确是没有012---It didn't.
以前你跟瑞秋的感觉   就是现在我跟爱丽丝的感觉012---What you used to have with Rachel is what I got with Alice.
那是什么样的感觉012---Now what is that like?
真的很酷012---It's so cool, man.
因为跟她在一起  比没有她的日子好多了012---It's because being with her is so much better than not being with her.
没错012---Yeah. Yeah.
为什么我不能那么做  我有过机会  却搞砸了012---Why can't I find that? I had it and I blew it.
我也要  你可以那么做012---Well, I want it! You can have it.
或许我办不到  或许我有问题012---Maybe I can't. Maybe there's something wrong with me.
不  真爱的确存在  我找到了  也得到了012---No, it's out there, man. I've seen it! I got it!
那你得好好把握  好的012---Then you hold on to it! All right, man!
太棒了  恭喜  你这个幸运的混蛋012---All right! Congratulations, you lucky bastard!
你是法兰克的伴郎012---You're Frank's best man?
我没办法拒绝  他们的爱是那么的纯洁012---I couldn't help it. Their love is so pure.
你呢012---What about you, huh?
我负责拿婚戒012---I'm the ring bearer.
爱丽丝  谢谢012---Hi! Oh, Alice, hi. Thanks.
很高兴你能赶过来  我有紧急家政状况012---I'm so glad you could come. I've got a real, um, Home Ec emergency.
天啊  谁死了  对  我知道012---Oh, my God. Who died on this? Yeah, I know.
真正的芥末酱灾难012---It's a real "mustard-tastrophe."
你能帮帮我吗  没问题012---Can you help me? Absolutely.
好吧  先用苏打水跟盐清洗012---Okay, first, we'll start with a little club soda and salt.
如果还不行的话… 你知道吗  算了  它已经毁了012---Then if that doesn't work... You know what? Forget it. It's ruined.
不  千万别那么做  洗不掉的话就把它剪掉012---Oh, no, never say that. If you can't get it out, cut around the stain...
缝上蕾丝就能做出漂亮抱枕012---...add a little lace, you make a stylish throw.
或是你别跟我弟弟法兰克结婚012---Or instead, maybe you could just not marry my brother, Frank?
可以小一点吗  让它从针头穿过去012---Can we make it smaller? Make it fit on the head of a pin?
我喜欢做出能穿过针头的东西012---I love when we make things fit on the head of a pin.
知道了  好吧012---Got it, yeah. Yeah, okay.
摩妮卡盖勒来了012---You have Monica Geller here.

嗨012---Hi.
这是什么东西012---What the hell is this?
等一下  明天早上再谈012---Hang on for a sec. I'll talk to you in the morning?
没问题012---You got it.
对不起  什么  这到底是什么意思012---I'm sorry. What? What's this supposed to mean?
我从来都搞不清楚该付多少小费012---Well, you know, I never know how much to tip.
小费是消费税的两倍  不是罗马尼亚国税的两倍012---You double the tax. Not double the tax of Romania.
这到底是怎么一回事   你想收买我吗012---I mean, what's the deal? Are you trying to buy me?
你都用这招要女人跟你约会012---Is this the way you get girls to go out with you?
我还在012---Uh, I'm still here.
你误会了  如果我不给你小费012---You're taking this wrong. If I didn't leave you that tip...
你不会来  我们不会吵架012---...you wouldn't have come, we wouldn't have this argument...
我们之间就不会有火花012---...and there wouldn't be this, uh, heat between us.
什么  少来了012---What? Come on.
你得承认我们的关系有进展了012---You gotta admit that our relationship is hitting a new level now.
你是大厨  我是客人012---You were the chef, and I was the customer.
现在我们是在吵嘴的情侣012---But now we're this couple that fights.
好吧012---Okay, um...
你是个疯子012---...you're a loon.
听着  忘了支票的事  好吗  我喜欢你012---Look, forget the check, okay? I like you.
你很棒012---I think you're great.
来吧  你觉得呢012---Come on, what do you say?
我不知道012---I don't know.
为什么012---Why not?
我不想鼓励这种行为012---I don't wanna encourage this behavior.
一顿饭  那是我唯一的要求  拜托012---One meal. That's all I'm asking for. Please?
我们出去吃饭012---We go out, we eat.
如果你玩得不开心  我给你一万块  我们就扯平了012---If you don't have a good time, I'll give you 10 grand, we're even.
嗨  不012---Hi. Aah! No!
等一下  放下邮件  是我012---Wait, no. Just put the mail down. It's me.
抱歉   为什么你不开灯呢012---Sorry. Why were you just all in the dark?
你的衣服闻起来好香  我只想窝在里面012---Well, um, your laundry smelled so good that I thought I'd curl up in it.
可以吗  没问题012---Is that all right?  Yeah, sure.
今天你过得还好吗012---So how was your day?
这可能是我一生中最糟糕的一天012---It's just probably the worst one since I've been alive.
什么  发生了什么事012---What, um...? What happened?
爱丽丝…012---Um, Alice, uh...
她跟我分手012---She, uh, called it off.
喔  不012---Oh, no.
她有说为什么吗012---Did, um... Did she say why?
她没说  她只说我太年轻012---Uh, no, not really. Just that I was too young.
我不懂为什么突然间我变的年轻了012---I don't see how I could suddenly be too young...
我比我们刚在一起时还老012---...because I'm older than I was when we first got together.
对  不  我不…012---Yeah, yeah, no, I don't...
我不知道  你知道吗  或许这样子也好012---I don't know. But you know what? Maybe it's just all for the best.
对  但是我好痛苦012---Well, yeah, if the best is like unbelievable pain.
甜心012---Oh, sweetie.
我终于找到幸福012---You know, I was just finally happy.
我人生中的第一次012---For the first time in my life...
我爸离开我后012---...after my dad left me...
因为偷那些鸟被捕012---...and then getting arrested for stealing those birds...
还有肺部被刺破的事之后012---...and then the whole punctured-lung thing.
天气冷时我还是很难深呼吸012---It's still really hard to take deep breaths in cold weather...
但有了爱丽丝后  那些痛苦都不见了012---...but with Alice, all that stuff kind of went away.
现在她走了  我不知道为什么012---And now it's gone, and I don't know why.
我来告诉你为什么  都是我害的012---Ugh. Well, I can tell you why. It's because of me.
你知道吗  我会那么做是因为我爱你  好吗012---But you know what? I only did it because I love you, okay?
什么  我跟爱丽丝谈了一下012---What? Um, I kind of had a little chat with Alice...
让她明白为什么你们不能在一起012---...and I sort of made her see why you two shouldn't be together.
有一天你也会明白  真的012---And you'll see it too, one day. You really, really will.
等一下  这都是你搞的鬼012---Wait a minute. This is because of you?
好吧012---Okay...
等一下  不  我妈妈不要我们在一起012---Wait, no. My mother didn't want us to be together...
她顶多把我绑在门廊上012---...but the worst thing she did was tie me to the porch.
好吧  可是…012---Okay, but...
我来找你  因为我以为你能了解012---I came to you because I thought you'd understand.
喔  不012---Oh, no!
不012---No... Ugh.
我很想摔门走人012---I would storm out of here...
如果我有钱或有地方可去的话012---...if I had some money or a place to go.
天啊  百万富翁来了012---Oh, my God! The millionaire's here!
天啊012---Oh, my God!
各位  拜托  我只是要跟他去吃晚餐012---Guys, please. I'm just gonna have dinner with him.
好吧  他请你吃晚餐  不代表你欠他任何东西012---Okay, just because he buys you dinner does not mean you owe him anything.
我知道012---I know.
好吧  记得点龙虾012---Okay, then get the lobster.
嘿  嗨012---Hey. Hi.
