因为你把它们吃光了012---...because you ate them all.
但我相信这一次不会是那样的012---But, you know, I'm sure that's not gonna happen this time.
我何不帮你登记三盒薄荷宝藏012---Why don't I just put you down for three Mint Treasures...
两盒鲁道夫呢012---...and just a couple of the Rudolphs?
不012---No.

好点子012---...good thoughts.
我想只要你继续做这份工作012---If you ask me, as long as you got this job...
你就不会想找其他工作012---...you got nothing pushing you to get another one.
你需要恐惧012---You need The Fear.
恐惧  他说的对012---The Fear? He's right.
要是你辞掉这份工作   你就会有动力012---If you quit this job, you then have motivation...
去找你想做的事012---...to go after a job you really want.
为什么你还在做你讨厌的工作   干嘛不辞职  来产生恐惧012---How come you're still at a job you hate? Why don't you quit and get The Fear?
因为我太害怕了012---Because I'm too afraid.

我要跟你提出辞呈  什么012---I'm gonna give you my week's notice. What?
阿甘  我不干了012---Gunther, I quit.

你还真的用了大号字体012---Well, you sure used a large font.
对   "咖啡厅服务生"012---Uh, yeah. Well, "Waitress at a Coffeehouse"...
跟"啦啦队长"占不了太多空间012---...and "Cheer Squad Co-captain" only took up so much room.
真的好笑012---Heh, heh. Hey, that's funny.
你很搞笑  钱德  你是个幽默的家伙012---You're funny, Chandler. You're a funny guy.

它快死掉了012---It's almost dead.
所以你得买下它  它才能完成它的圣诞节使命012---But that's why you have to buy it, so that it can fulfill its Christmas destiny.
不然他们会把它丢进碎木机  告诉他  乔伊012---Otherwise, they're gonna throw it into the chipper. Tell him, Joey.
啊012---Uh...
对  无法完成圣诞节使命的树012---Yeah, the trees that don't fulfill their Christmas destiny, heh...

只是…我想过节让人很伤感012---I guess it's just... The holidays are just hard.
甜心  因为你妈妈在圣诞节前后过世的吗012---Oh, honey, is that because your mom died around Christmas?
我还没想到那件事呢012---Oh, I wasn't even thinking about that.
你好  你卖了几盒012---Hi there. How many did you sell?
我不告诉你  你是害莎拉摔断腿的坏人012---I'm not gonna tell you. You're the bad man who broke Sarah's leg.
