大家好  欢迎收看《神奇发现》012---Welcome, everybody. Welcome to Amazing Discoveries.
又开始了012---Oh, oh! It's on again.
各位  拜托别看了012---Guys, could we please not watch this? ALL: Shh.
大家遇过这种事吗  你想好好喝杯牛奶012---Folks, this ever happen to you? You go to get a nice glass of milk...
但牛奶纸盒怎么样都打不开012---...but these darn cartons are so flinging, flanging hard to open.
天啊  你说的对  麦克012---Boy, you said it, Mike.
哇  哇012---Aw. Aw.
一定有更好的办法  没错  凯文012---There's gotta be a better way. And there is, Kevin.
可以把电视关了吗  想都别想  凯文012---Can we please turn this off?  No way, Kevin.
如果我告诉大家  有一种新产品保证…012---What if I told you there's a new product that guarantees...
你不必再打开牛奶纸盒了呢012---...you'll never have to open up milk cartons again?
为大家介绍牛奶大师2000012---Meet the Milkmaster 2000.
有兴趣吗  我当然有兴趣012---Intrigued? You're flinging, flanging right I am.
这是他的第一次  他没用过这个  你会看到这使用起来有多方便012---This is his first time. He's never used this. You're gonna see how easy this is to do.
适用于所有牛奶纸盒  好简单012---This works in any milk carton. Wow, it is easy. Ha, ha.
现在我每天都可以喝牛奶了012---Now I can have milk every day.
《老友记》 第三季 第4集  隧道012---Friends S03E04  The One with the Metaphorical Tunnel
这是正式结果  根本没有好电影可看012---It's official. There are no good movies.
我们可以去看烂电影  在电影院里亲热012---So let's go to a bad one and make out.
或许你们会希望我转过来  靠着我的背亲热012---Perhaps you would like me to turn like this so you can bunny-bump against my back?
嘿  嘿012---Hey.  Hey.
兄弟  怎么了  或许你能告诉我012---Hey, man. What's up?  Maybe you can tell me.
我的经纪人想知道  为什么今天我没有去试镜012---My agent would like to know why I didn't show up at my audition today...
数周以来她首度帮我找到的好机会  为什么你没把留言给我012---...the first good thing she gets me in weeks. How could you not give me the message?
我可以告诉你  我很享受罪恶感012---I'll tell you, I do enjoy guilt...
但那不是我干的012---...but it wasn't me.
对  就是他012---Yes, it was. It was him. Uh-huh.
好吧  是我干的012---Okay, it was me.
为什么会是你  这真的很疯狂012---How was it you?  Well, it was all so crazy, you know?
钱德躲在柜子里数到十  但他数到七的时候012---Chandler was in the closet counting to 10 and was up to seven...
我还没有找到地方躲012---...and I hadn't found a place to hide yet.
听着  我打算跟你说012---Look, I meant to tell you
我都写在手上  看吧  真的012---and I wrote it all down on my hand. See? All of it.
对  那的确是我的试镜  没错012---Yep, that's my audition.  Yeah.
看吧  这就是为什么  我会四处放便条纸012---See? Now, this is why I keep notepads everywhere.
对  所以我们不找你一起玩012---Yep. And that's why we don't invite you to play.
那有什么好难过的  你可以改个时间去试镜012---What is the great tragedy here? Get yourself another appointment.
伊斯特试过了  选角导演说我错失了机会012---Well, Estelle tried. The casting director told her I missed my chance.
那不公平012---Well, that is unfair.
我打电话跟她说那是我的错012---I'll call her. I'll tell her it was totally my fault.
你不能那么做  选角导演不跟朋友说话012---You can't. The casting director doesn't talk to friends.
她只跟经纪人谈  她一定过着悲惨的生活012---She only talks to agents.  What a sad little life she must lead.
好吧012---Okay. Ooh.
你在做什么  不  我知道012---What are you doing? What are you doing?  No, I know, I know. Ooh.
我是菲比布非办公室的凯特琳012---Hi, this is Caitlin from Phoebe Buffay's office.
可以跟菲比说话吗012---Um, is, um, Anne there for Phoebe?
她会知道是关于什么事012---She'll know what it's about.
快挂断…012---Hang up. Hang up right...
安妮  听着  乔伊崔比亚尼有个问题012---Annie? Hi. Listen, we've got a problem with Joey Tribbiani.
显然他没去试镜  你是跟我办公室的哪个人联络的012---Apparently, he missed his audition. Who did you speak to in my office?
伊斯特  我不知道该怎么处理她012---Estelle? I don't know what I'm gonna do with her.
就算你老公跑了  还烧掉房子  日子还是得过下去012---So your husband leaves and burns down the apartment. The world does not stop.
有人跟我一样害怕吗012---Is anybody else scared?
如果乔伊无法试镜  那都是伊斯特的错  我不在乎012---If Joey loses this audition, then that is it for Estelle. I don't care.
安妮  你太棒了 你何时能见他  我需要笔012---Annie, you are a doll. What time can you see him? I need a pen. Pen.
拿便条纸给她…快点012---Get the woman a pad. Get the woman a pad. A pad! A pad!
现在你要便条纸了012---Oh, now you want a pad.
嘿  哈罗012---Hey.  Hello.
我的儿子在哪里012---Where's my boy?
我儿子来了012---Here's my boy.
他拿着他的洋娃娃012---And here's his Barbie.
我儿子拿着洋娃娃做什么012---What's, uh...? What's my boy doing with a Barbie?
他自己在玩具店挑的  他很喜欢012---He picked it out at the toy store himself. He loves it.
他带着它四处跑  把它当成安抚毯012---He carries it everywhere, like a security blanket.
只是多了滑雪靴跟超酷的贝雷帽012---But with ski boots and a kicky beret.
对  真的很酷012---Yeah, it's cute.
为什么他要买洋娃娃012---Why does he have it again?
他买了洋娃娃  有什么大不了的012---So he's got a doll. So what?
除非你害怕他长大后会…012---Unless you're afraid he's gonna grow up to be...
加入演艺圈012---...in show business.
这跟他由两个女人抚养长大的事实  毫无关系吧012---This wouldn't have to do with the fact that he's being raised by two women?
你们知道吗  没关系  如果你们不反对洋娃娃  我也是012---You know what? It's fine. If you're okay with the Barbie thing, so am I.
把洋娃娃交给爸爸  洋娃娃给我  好吧  要不要…012---Give Daddy the Barbie. Give me the Barbie. Okay, how about...?
你不想玩怪兽卡车吗012---Don't you wanna play with a monster truck?
不要吗  好吧012---No? Okay.
要不要玩恐龙战士012---Ooh, ooh. How about a Dino-Soldier?
罗斯  你太可悲了012---You are so pathetic.
为什么你儿子不能玩洋娃娃012---Why can't your son just play with his doll?
我得去上班了012---I gotta go to work.
谁看到我左边的咪咪了012---Has anybody seen my left boob?
我喜欢那部电影012---I loved that movie.
原来在这里  乔伊  你在做什么012---Here it is. Joey, what are you doing?
对不起  感觉太舒服了012---I'm sorry. It just felt nice.
乔伊  乔伊  快接电话012---Joe. Joe. Answer the phone.
我只剩一只手  你得帮我服务  帮我拿毛衣过来012---I only got one arm. You should do stuff for me. Get me a sweater.
快点  是珍妮丝打来的012---Just do it. It's Janice.
我一接  今晚就得跟她见面012---And if I get it, I'm gonna have to see her tonight.
太棒了  今晚我得跟她见面012---Oh, that's great. I'm gonna have to see her tonight.
为什么你不想见珍妮丝012---Why don't you wanna see Janice?
昨天吃晚餐时  一上菜012---Last night at dinner, when the meals came...
她将她点的柠檬香鸡排  一半放进我盘子里  挖走我的番茄012---...she put half her chicken piccata on my plate and took all my tomatoes.
真的很糟糕  因为…012---And that's bad...
你讨厌柠檬香鸡排012---...because you hate chicken piccata?
不012---No.
你不想分享番茄  番茄对你来说很重要012---You didn't wanna share your tomatoes. Tomatoes are very important to you.
不是  是突然间我们变成这样的情侣012---All of a sudden, we were this couple.
我的脑海里警铃大响012---And this alarm started going off in my head.
快逃命  闪人了012---"Run for your life! Get out of the building!"
男人太难以置信了012---Ugh. Men are unbelievable.
你们到底是怎么了012---What is it with you people?
你们一有感觉就得逃跑012---The minute you feel something, you have to run away?
我知道  那…012---I know. That...
所以今晚我不想去  我担心我会说出蠢话012---That's why I don't wanna go tonight. I'm afraid I'm gonna say something stupid.
你是说男人会装出冷淡无情012---Oh. You mean that guy thing where you act mean and distant...
逼我们跟你们分手012---...until you get us to break up with you? Mm-hm.
你们都知道012---Hey, you know about that?
我怎么做  我要过这一关012---What do I do? I wanna get past this.
我不要害怕承诺012---I don't wanna be afraid of the commitment thing.
我要通过隧道  直奔另一头012---I wanna go through the tunnel to the other side.
在那里你不会害怕承诺012---Where there's no fear of commitment. Ah.
大家有…012---Do we have any...?
大家有点子吗012---Do we have any thoughts here?
我不曾通过隧道  因为…012---I've never been through the tunnel myself because...
因为车上只能有一个女孩012---...you're not allowed through with more than one girl in the car.
但我觉得这跟其他事一样  面对恐惧012---But it seems to me it's pretty much like anything else. Face your fear.
怕高的人就爬到大楼顶楼012---You have a fear of heights? Go to the top of the building.
怕虫子的人012---You're afraid of bugs.
去抓只虫子来012---Get a bug.
对吧012---Right?
以现在的情况  你害怕承诺012---You have a fear of commitment.
我建议你乖乖出现  成为史上最爱承诺的男人012---So I say you go in there and you be the most committed guy there ever was.
没错  那真的很有道理012---Amazingly, that makes sense.
你们真的那么想  对  冲啊  兄弟012---Do you think? Oh, yeah. Go for it, man.
从高处跳下012---Jump off the high dive.
盯着枪管  逆风尿尿012---Stare down the barrel of the gun. Pee into the wind.
乔伊  如果我得盯着枪管看012---Joe, if I'm staring down the barrel of a gun...
我会尿得到处都是012---...I'm gonna be pretty much peeing every which way.
是你今天早上的试镜结果012---Ooh, it's your audition from this morning.
我能打一下电话吗012---Can I use the phone?
当然  那是电话的功能  供紧急事件跟假经纪人使用012---Sure, that's what it's there for. Emergencies and, uh, pretend agents.
加油  宝贝012---Come on, baby. Come on.
嗨  我是菲比布非  请问哪位找012---[IN HIGH VOICE] Hi. I have Phoebe Buffay returning a page.
好的  她在车里  我帮你接过去012---Okay, well, she's in her car. I'll have to patch you through.
非常聪明012---Very nice touch.
好的  请说012---Okay, go ahead.
快说…快说012---Talk, talk, talk.  Oh, oh. Um... Ahem.
嗨  安妮012---Hi, Annie?
太棒了  你被录取了012---Fantastic. You got it.
你被录取了012---Oh! You got it.
你问我他是照薪资标准计薪吗  我不知道012---Um, will he work for scale, you ask me? Well, I don't know about that.
我要他那么做  他就得那么做012---Ahem. Except that I do and he will.
太棒了  你真是个甜心012---Great. Oh, you are such a sweetheart.
我很乐意跟你共进午餐012---I would love to have lunch with you.
我们何不约下…012---How about we have lunch next...?
我进隧道了012---Oop, went through a tunnel. Ha, ha.
不可思议012---Unbelievable.
太谢谢你了012---Oh, thank you so much. Ha, ha.
这真的很好玩  我是说我没用过汽车电话012---It was really fun. I mean, I've never talked on a car phone before.
你真的太棒了  你能帮我一个大忙吗012---Oh. You are so amazing. Could you do me this huge favor?
我要参加另一场试镜  但伊斯特始终没办法帮我安排012---There's this one other audition I want, and Estelle couldn't get me in.
我不知道  一次还蛮好玩的  可是…012---Uh, I don't know. It was fun one time, but...
别这样  拜托  再一次就好012---Come on, please? It would just be this one more.
事实上是两次012---Well, actually it's two.
两次   对012---Two?  Yeah.
应该是三次012---Well, really it's three.
拜托  你真的很厉害  我爱你012---Please? You're so good at it. I love you.
好吧  就三次  对吧012---Okay. But just these three, right?
不  是四次012---No, it's four.
为什么今晚你想在家里吃饭012---So how come you wanted to eat in tonight?
因为我要…012---Because I wanted...
送你这个012---...to give you this.
你真的太窝心了012---Oh. Are you a puppy!
壁纸贴012---Contact paper.
跟你上床的人送你壁纸贴时012---You never know what to say when someone you're sleeping with...
你会不知道该说什么012---...gives you contact paper. Ha, ha.
等一下  还有一样礼物  看吧  壁纸贴少不了012---Wait, there's more. See, the contact paper is to go...
全新抽屉012---...in your brand-new drawer.
听着  这是我柜子的抽屉012---See, the drawer actually goes in my dresser.
你不必这么做012---Oh. You didn't have to do this.
我一定要012---Yes, I did.
我一定要  因为你是我的女朋友012---Yes, I did. Because you're my girlfriend...
女朋友就该得到那些东西012---...and that's what girlfriends should get.
我不知道该怎么说012---Oh. Well, I gotta buy a vowel...
因为…天啊012---...because, oh, my God. Mwah.
谁想得到有一天012---Who would've thought that someday...
钱德“兵”会送我抽屉呢012---...Chandler Bing would buy me a drawer?
我也想不到012---Well, not me.
但事实就是那样  还有一件事012---But that's what's happened. And, uh, there's more.
我们该去旅行012---We should take a trip.
是吗012---We should?
对  我们是情侣  情侣都会那么做012---Yup. We're a couple, and that's what couples do.
我要跟你爸妈见面012---And I wanna meet your parents.
我们该跟你爸妈一起旅行012---We should take a trip with your parents.
我想我们不必那么做  因为你吓到我了012---I don't think we need to, because you're tripping me out right now.
你没事吧  我很好012---Are you okay? No, I am.
我好得很  这真的太棒了012---Ha, ha. I actually am. This is amazing.
我一辈子都害怕这么做012---My entire life, I have feared this place.
现在我做了  这有什么大不了的012---And now that I'm here, it's like, what was the big deal?
或许我可以说"我们一起住吧"  我也能接受012---I could probably say, "Let's move in together," and I'd be okay.
或许你要我们住在一起012---You probably want us to move in together?
我不害怕  对  我害怕得要命012---It doesn't scare me.  Yeah, well it scares me.
我还没有办好离婚手续  你邀请我来吃意大利面012---I'm not even divorced yet. You just invited me over here for pasta...
突然间你说我们得住在一起012---...and all of a sudden you're talking about moving in together.
我甚至一点都不饿012---And I wasn't even that hungry.
你知道吗  已经很晚了  我该…012---You know what? It's getting really late, and I should just, um...
别走  我吓到你了  我说太多了012---Don't go. I've scared you. I've said too much.
我无药可救又绝望  渴求着爱情012---I'm hopeless and awkward and desperate for love.
嘿  珍妮丝  是我012---Hey, Janice, it's me.
嗯哈012---Uh, ahem.
我要预先跟你道歉  因为我要跑到街上追你012---I wanted to apologize in advance for having chased you down the street.
再见012---Bye-bye.
拿去吧  甜心 这应该会有帮助012---Here you go, honey. This will help.
我终于追上她  她说012---So I catch up to her and she says...
这段关系发展得太快  我们应该放慢脚步012---...this relationship's going too fast and we have to slow down.
那不是件好事012---Ugh. Ugh. That is never good.
然后她说我…012---Then I got all...
太粘人  太依赖了012---...needy and clingy.
等一下  或许没那么糟糕  你们是怎么分开的012---Now, wait a minute. Maybe it's not so bad. How did you leave it?
她说她会打电话给我012---She said she'd call me.
天啊012---Oh, God.
欢迎光临我们这边的隧道012---Ugh. Welcome to our side of the tunnel.
对了  这个冰淇淋好难吃的012---This ice cream tastes like crap, by the way.
对  那是低卡脱脂豆浆冰淇淋012---Yeah, well, it's that low-cal, nondairy, soy-milk junk.
我们只在无药可救时  才会吃真的冰淇淋012---We save the real stuff for the truly terminal cases.
当你常常无药可救时  就得改吃低脂冰淇淋012---When you start getting screwed over all the time, you gotta switch to low-fat.
没错012---Yeah, you do.
你们不觉得我无药可救012---So you don't think I'm terminal?
当然  你不是无药可救  我们只是得防止事情恶化012---Oh, no, not at all. You're not terminal. We just need some damage control.
好吧  我该打电话给她吗012---Okay. Okay. So should I call her?
不012---No.
现在是关键时刻  如果你想打电话给她012---It's a critical time. If you feel yourself reaching for that phone...
你得去血拼或泡个澡012---...you go shopping, you get your butt in a bubble bath.
如果你要她回来  就得开始表现出高傲的样子012---If you want her back, you have got to start acting aloof.
她得知道你一点都不粘人012---She has to know you're not needy.
你要做的是012---So, what you have to do is...
就是故意跟她巧遇012---...you have to accidentally run into her on purpose...
装出高傲的样子012---...and then act aloof.
那样我就不会失去她012---So I'm not gonna lose her?
甜心  你不是个失败者012---Oh, honey, you're not a total loser.
我是问  我就不会失去她了吗012---I said, so I'm not gonna lose her?
对012---Oh.
看看是谁来了012---Guess who's here.
他是玩具王国的超级硬汉  小班012---It's the toughest guy in Toyland, Ben.
真正的美国英雄  我是特种部队012---Real American hero I'm G.I. Joe
放下洋娃娃…012---Drop the Barbie. Drop the Barbie.
特种部队  你真的觉得他会玩吗012---G.I. Joe? You really think he's gonna fall for that?
特种部队  酷啊  我能玩吗012---G.I. Joe? Cool. Can I play?
看吧  小班  他是保护美国海外石油利益的玩具012---Look, Ben. It's a toy that protects U.S. Oil interests overseas.
加油 加油 特种部队 特种部队012---Go, Joe!
哈罗012---Hello. Oh.
菲比  你来了  不  我走错门了  抱歉012---Phoebe, there you are. No, it's not. Sorry.
菲比  等一下012---But, Phoebe, wait, wait. Phoebe. Phoebe.
乔伊  好吧  你穿那条裤子012---Oh, Joey. Oh, okay. See, I didn't recognize you...
害我都认不出来了012---...in those pants.
听着  我试镜的那部电视电影  有消息了吗012---That TV movie I went in for, did you hear anything?
我想我有机会012---I think I got a shot at it.
对  他们打电话来  你没被录取012---Yes, they called. You didn't get it.
好吗  你没被录取  抱歉012---Okay? I mean, you didn't get it. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
没关系  这种事常发生012---That's okay. These things happen.
但不该是这样的  你知道吗012---But they shouldn't happen. You know what?
你从事一个非常糟糕的行业012---You're in a terrible, terrible business.
我不想害你露出那种表情012---I don't wanna be the person who makes your face look like that. Ugh.
我没事  看吧012---I'm okay. See?
现在你既悲伤又可怕012---Now you're sad and creepy.
你知道吗  对不起  我不干了012---You know what? I'm sorry. I quit, okay?
不  你不能不干了  你是我最棒的经纪人012---No, no, no, you can't quit. You're the best agent I ever had.
听着  当演员就一定会被拒绝  你不能把它视为人身攻击012---Look, rejection is part of being an actor. You can't take it personal.
这不是人身攻击  他们说从没看过  意大利腔这么怪的意大利裔演员012---Not personal? They said they'd never met an Italian actor with a worse Italian accent.
他们真的那样说012---They actually said that?
对  天啊  你又是那个表情  看吧  我没办法做这份工作012---Yeah. Oh, God, there's that face again. See? I can't do this job.
不  所以你非做这份工作不可012---No, this is why you have to do this job.
经纪人老是在说谎012---Agents always lie.
伊斯特会说 "他们挑了其他类型的演员"012---Estelle just says stuff like, "They went another way."
但我可以利用这一点012---But this? I can use this.
我可以练习新腔调012---I can work on a new accent.
好吧  如果那真的能帮助你  好012---Yeah, okay. No. If it helps you, okay. Yeah.
你永远抓不到我  特种部队012---You'll never get me, Joe!
不  谢谢012---No, thank you.
钱德012---Chandler.
哈罗  珍妮丝012---Hello, Janice.
你来这里做什么012---What are you doing here?
我来买东西012---Uh, just a bit of shopping.
你还好吗012---How have you been?
你在学英国口音吗012---Are you being British?
不012---No.
现在不是了012---Not anymore.
你为什么会来这里买东西  你根本不住在这个社区012---Why are you shopping here? You don't live in this neighborhood.
你在这里等我吗012---Were you here waiting for me?
我只是…你知道的012---I'm just, uh, you know...
来买派对需要用的东西012---...picking up some things for a party.
大麦012---Barley?
哪门子的派对会吃大麦012---What kind of a party serves barley?
对不起  我的朋友没有你朋友优雅012---Well, I'm sorry if my friends aren't as sophisticated as yours.
派对在哪里举行  就在这里雀儿喜区012---Where is this party? Here in Chelsea.
派对主人是谁012---Whose party is it?
