他们一开门   我们马上冲进去012---So when they open those doors, fan out.
这就是你们的目标  记住它012---Now, this is what you're looking for. Memorize it.
找到婚纱后就吹哨子  好吗012---When you locate the dress blow on these, all right?
用力吹三声  一听到哨音后  马上跑过来012---Three sharp blasts. When you hear it, come running.

尽管笑吧  但她给我留言  说她想再跟我约会012---Laugh all you want, but she left me a message saying she'd like to go out again.
事实上  我正要打电话给她012---Oh. In fact, I'll go call her right now.
我一定会告诉她   我的朋友钱德说012---And I'll make sure and tell her my friend Chandler says...
嘿  钱德  嘿012---Hey, Chandler. Hey.
抱歉昨晚我失约了  我刚好有个约会012---Listen, sorry I didn't stop by last night, but I had a date.
乔伊  那快凌晨一点  就算没过来也没关系012---Uh Joe, when it's 1:00 in the morning and you don't come by? That's okay.
我跟一个辣妹约会  她刚刚搬到对面街012---Well check it out. It was with this really hot girl who just moved in right across the street.
真的吗  她就住在对面街  对012---Really? Right across the street? Yeah.
你什么时候认识她的   两天前012---When did you meet her? Two days ago.
太棒了012---Excellent!
罗斯也认识了个女孩  是吗012---You know, Ross met somebody too. Oh, yeah?
嘿  怎么样012---Hey. How'd it go?
太棒了  我们星期六要再出去玩012---Great. We're going out again Saturday.
但我刚刚发现她也在跟别人约会012---But I just found out she's also seeing some other guy.
真的吗012---Really?
乔伊  如果你是罗斯你会怎么做012---Joe, what would you do if you were in Ross' situation?
我跟他差不多  跟我约会的女孩也在跟别人约会012---Well, I sort of am. I'm dating this girl who's also seeing another guy.
但我一点都不担心012---But I'm not too worried about it.
你不必担心  但相信我  我可不想当你的竞争者012---Well you shouldn't be. Believe me, I wouldn't want to be the guy who's up against you.
那个混蛋一定会输的012---I mean, that doofus is going to lose.
真的太有趣了012---So this is nice.
真希望我能留下来  相信我012---I wish I didn't have to go. Believe me.
但不幸的是我得走了012---But I unfortunately have to.
对了  顺便问下  跟你们约会的女孩叫什么名字012---Oh uh, By the way, what's the name of the girl you're dating?
克丽丝汀莱  再见012---Kristen Leigh. Bye.
很明显  我们之中  只有一个人能继续跟她约会012---Well, obviously, only one of us can keep dating her.
没错  我们该怎么决定012---Obviously. So how do we decide?
好了  我们得客观地来解决这件事012---Well now, let's look at this objectively.
我想我该跟她约会012---I think I should date her.
或是我该跟她约会012---Or I'm the one who dates her.
太有趣了  但是听好了  我跟她约会012---That's interesting. But check this out. I date her.
好吧  但是换个角度来说012---Yeah, I like that. But just to go in another direction--
好吧  这样我们是谈不出结论来的012---Okay. okay. This can go on for a while.
没错  我们该点些吃的  不  乔伊012---Yeah well we should order some food then. No, Joey.
听着  我们为什么不让她来决定呢012---Look, why don't, why don't we just let her decide, okay?
我们都再跟她约会一次012---We'll each go out with her one more time.
看看她更喜欢谁012---And we'll see who she likes best.
听起来很公平012---That sounds fair.
或许我会带她到新开的法国餐厅吃饭012---Maybe I'll take her to that new French restaurant down the street.
等一下  我们得对约会费用设下限制012---Ah yeah. Wait a second. Look we're gonna have to set a spending limit on the date.
我可没有钱带她去高级餐厅吃饭012---I don't have the money to take her to a fancy place like that.
那只有抱歉了  但那是我的约会方式012---Well, sorry. That's what I do on dates.
好吧  我想我也有我的方式012---All right. Well, I guess I'll just have to do what I do on dates.
我们来决定费用限制  好吧012---So let's decide on a spending limit. Yeah.
再加一片012---And a slice...
六块钱012---Six dollars?
我想是一百块  好吧012---I was thinking more like a hundred. Okay.
你能借我94块吗012---Can I borrow 94 dollars?
我知道  你能帮我拿张面纸吗012---I know. Can you hand me a tissue?
你家没有健怡可乐了012---You're out of Diet Coke.
喂012---Hello?
什么  你什么012---What? You what?
你给我听好了  小姐012---You listen here, missy!
什么012---What?
是那个梅根打来的  她订下《摇摆国王》  日期是我们结婚的那一天012---That was that girl Megan. She booked The Swing Kings on the day of our wedding...
还说如果我不把婚纱让给她  我就没有乐团012---...and said that I couldn't have them back unless I gave her the dress!
这么说的话  《尸体》乐队有空了012---Does that mean Carcass is available?
我该怎么办  那件婚纱  就是我一直想要的012---What am I gonna do? That's the dress! That is "the" dress!
钱德喜欢那个乐团  我该怎么办啊012---Chandler wants the band. What do I do?
想办法说服他放弃  那怎么做呢012---Well just figure out a way to talk him out of it. How?
你家卫生纸用完了012---You're out of toilet paper!
嗨  怎么样012---Hey. What's up?
我过来祝你约会顺利啊012---I just wanted to come by and y'know,wish you good luck on your date.

我们在葛兰梅西餐厅  订了八点的位子012---We have 8:00 reservations at Grand Merci Bistro.
时间只剩20分钟  你最好快去换衣服012---Wow, that's in 2O minutes. You'd better get dressed.
我已经换好衣服了  太好了012---I am dressed. Oh, well, good.
对我来说012---For me.
这是什么  你在敷脸012---What's this? Did you give yourself a facial?
我用油性护肤霜012---I have an oily T-zone.
好吧  兄弟012---Okay, dude.
你送克丽丝汀花  没错012---Hey, you sent Kristen flowers? That's right.
你花了一百块  你把钱花光了  你完蛋了012---You spent 100 dollars. That's the limit. You're screwed!
我在约会前送她花  所以技术上来说012---Actually, I sent the flowers before the actual date, so technically...
技术上来说  我没有犯规  谢谢你来看我012---...technically, I didn't break any rules. Thanks for stopping by though.
你要真的那么玩  我也可以犯规012---Oh-oh! So that's the way it's gonna be? Yeah I can break the rules too. y'know!
那你打算怎么办  我不知道012---Oh yeah? What are you gonna do? I don't know.
为什么我一点都不讶异  告诉你罗斯  我不会放过你的012---Why am I not surprised? Y'know what Ross? I'm not gonna let you get away with this!
我想你没有太多的选择  我们走着瞧012---I don't think you have much choice. Well we'll see!
再见  对  再见012---Bye-bye. Yeah, bye-bye.
嘿  只要薄薄地敷一层就好012---Hey! So just a light layer?
知道  只要敷这里跟这里012---Yeah, just here and there.
乔伊又把肉酱滴在栏杆上了012---Joey got meat sauce on the banister again.
摇摆音乐太落伍了012---Yeah, swing music is so out.
菲比  他要在这房间里才听得到012---Phoebe, he's gotta be in the room for that to work.
你们到底在说什么012---What are you guys talking about?
我们在谈《摇摆国王》012---Well umm, we were just talking about the y'know, the Swing Kings ...
讨论到底该不该请他们来012---...and just wondering whether y'know, they were the right way to go.
有一次我去参加  请摇摆乐团来表演的婚礼012---Yeah, I went to a wedding once where they had swing music...
两个月后他们就离婚了012---...and two months later the couple got divorced.
我倒不是说这其中必有联系012---And now I'm not saying there's any connection here y'know,...
但他们的确告诉我  那是他们离婚的原因012---...but they did tell me that's why they got divorced.
但我喜欢摇摆音乐012---But I love swing music!
但《摇摆国王》012---Yeah but The Swing Kings?
他们烂到有人听他们的演唱会死掉  他们就那么死了012---y'know they suck so much that people actually die at their concerts. They just stop living.
我只知道摩妮卡跟我  去看他们演唱时非常开心012---Look all I know is when Monica and I went to see them, we had fun.
事实上还有一个原因012---And there's another reason too.
是什么原因  我不想说012---Well, what is the other reason? I don't want to say.
你非说不可  或许它很愚蠢012---Well, you have to, because maybe it's stupid.
摩妮卡跟我  随着他们的音乐起舞时012---Well it's just while Monica and I were dancing to them...
那是我第一次知道012---...it was the first time I knew that...
你就是我想一辈子共舞的女人012---...you were the woman that I wanted to dance all my dances with.
糟糕012---Oh, crap.
我们的桌子  马上就准备好  太棒了012---So they said our table will be ready in just a few minutes. Oh, great.
你的背好点了吗  没事了012---Is your back feeling better? Oh yeah, it's fine.
我猜肌肉越多012---I guess, ahem, the more muscles you have...
就越可能抽筋012---...the more they can spasm out of control.
克丽丝汀  乔伊012---Kristen? Joey!

乔伊不喜欢提这件事012---Well Joey doesn't like to talk about it...
但他主演过《我们的日子》012---...but he's one of the stars of Days of Our Lives.
没错  你不是演女人吗012---That's right. That's right. Don't you play a woman?
那是被困在男人身体里的女人012---A woman in a man's body.
这还好点012---Much better.

趁女伴去上洗手问  偷吃掉她的食物吗012---...that when the girl goes to the bathroom, you eat some of her food?
你说服务生吃掉我的蟹饼012---You said the waiter ate my crab cake.
罗斯  你的第一段婚姻  为什么会结束012---Yeah. So, Ross, well now—why did that first marriage break up? Hm?
因为你前妻是异性恋  还是同性恋啊012---Was it because the woman was straight or because she was a lesbian?
你们两个认识吗  不认识012---Do you two know each other? No.
只是罗斯看起来像是  会跟有同性恋倾向的女人012---No. It just seems like Ross is the kind of a guy that would marry a woman...
结婚后  逼得她非得出柜的男人012---...on the verge of being a lesbian and then push her over the edge.
等一下  你不是淋病海报上的那个男的吗012---Wait a minute! Were you on a poster for gonorrhea?
