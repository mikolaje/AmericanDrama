大家好  感恩节快乐  嘘嘘012---Hey, everybody. Happy Thanksgiving. Shh.
不让大家知道  今年有感恩节吗012---What, are we keeping Thanksgiving a secret this year?
不是  我们正在玩一个游戏012---No, we're playing this game I learned at work.
你要在六分钟内  写出美国各州州名012---You have to name all the states in six minutes.
这个啊   太容易了012---What? That's, like, insanely easy.
事实上这个游戏很难   你总是会漏掉一个012---No, it's harder than it sounds. You always forget at least one.
某些人会漏掉  十四个012---Or in some cases, 14.
这太蠢了  我没有跟任何人玩012---It's a stupid game and I wasn't playing against other people...
所以技术上来说我没输012---...so technically, I didn't lose.
你忘了十四州的州名012---You forgot 14 states?
没有人在乎南北达科他州012---Nobody cares about the Dakotas.
好了  时间到012---Oh, okay, time's up.
好了  我写出四十八州012---All right, I got 48.
还不错  菲比呢012---Oh, that's not bad. Pheebs?
我厌倦写州名   所以决定写出各种芹菜的名字012---Oh, I got tired of naming states, so I decided to list the types of celery.
我写了一个  普通芹菜012---And I have one, regular celery.
好   瑞秋写出四十八州   菲比在蔬菜名称方面012---Okay, so Rachel's got 48 and Phoebe has the lead in...
称霸  乔伊呢012---...vegetables. Joey?
跟钱德的愚蠢州名游戏新冠军打声招呼吧012---Say hello to the new champ of Chandler's dumb states game.
哇   你写了几个   五十六个012---Wow, how many you got? Fifty-six.
老友记  第七季  第8集  钱德不爱狗012---Friends S07E08  The One Where Chandler Doesn't Like Dogs
新英格兰为什么不是一个州012---Hey, how is New England not a state?
他们有运动代表队012---Huh? They have a sports team.
南奥勒冈有运动代表队吗012---Does South Oregon have a sports team?
对啦012---There you go.
为什么多了一付餐具012---How come we have one extra place setting?
你邀了你的助理过来  对了  抱歉  秦格不来了012---Because you invited your assistant. Oh, right, sorry. Tag's not coming.
他女朋友来了  所以他得去陪她012---His girlfriend came into town, so he's spending Thanksgiving with her.
你为什么没有告诉我012---Oh, why didn't you tell me'?
我帮他做了专属的  番薯酿南瓜012---I made him his own individual sweet potato stuffed pumpkin.
我本来想说   但我想012---Oh, well, I was going to, but then I figured, you know...
你做的菜既好吃  又好看012---...your food is so delicious and perfect...
我想多吃一点你做的南瓜012---...you can never have too many of those pumpkin things.
你这话太假了  你以为我会相信  不过我还是觉得听着很高兴012---You'd think I wouldn't enjoy that because it is so fake, ha, ha, but I still do.
普通芹菜012---Regular celery.
我已经写了012---Oh, I already have that.
好了  时间还剩下很多012---Done, with time to spare.
这可能是新世界记录   我讨厌对你们说教012---Ooh, this may be a new world's record. You know, I hate to lecture you guys...
但这真的是太丢脸了  一群受过良好教育的成年人012---...but it's kind of disgraceful that a group of well-educated adults...
跟乔伊  无法写出全部的州名012---...and Joey, can't name all the states.
你们看过地图  或是圆圆的色彩鲜艳叫做"地球仪"的东西吗012---You ever see a map or one of those round colorful things called a globe?
麦哲伦先生  你只答对了四十六州012---Uh, Magellan? You got 46 states.
什么   不可能   四十六州012---What? That's impossible. Forty-six.
那个受过良好教育  写不出剩下十州州名的人是谁012---Well, who's well-educated now, Mr. I-Forgot-Ten-States?
烤箱太满了  我要借乔伊的烤箱012---I'm out of oven space. I'm gonna go turn on Joey's.
拜托   看好他   别让乔伊偷吃东西012---Please, watch him. Do not let Joey eat any of the food.
我只有一个人012---I am only one man.
好了   时间到   再给我1分钟012---Okay, time is up. Give me another minute.
如果现在想不出来   你永远都想不出来   好吗012---Ross, if you don't know them by now, you will never know them, okay?
那就是这个游戏好玩的地方   它会让你想要杀了自己012---That is the beauty of this game. It makes you want to kill yourself.
太疯狂了   我一定答得出来012---This is crazy. I can do this.
好吧   我敢说我能在晚饭前写出五十个州的州名012---All right, uh, I bet I can get all 50, uh, before dinner.
好吧   但你写不出来就不能吃晚饭012---Okay, but if you can't, no dinner.
就这么说定了012---You're on.
别偷看我的答案   里面有很多你写不出来的州名012---All right, don't look at my list, because there's a lot on there that you don't have.
你知道你的烤箱坏了吗012---Hey, did you guys know your oven doesn't work?
可装满外送菜单的抽屉   没坏吧012---But the drawer full of takeout menus is okay, right?
罗斯   我要借用你的烤箱012---Ross, I'm gonna use yours, okay? Shh.
钱德   快来帮我012---Chandler, give me a hand.
乔伊   别让罗斯偷看地图或你家的地球仪012---Sure. Joey, do not let Ross look at any maps or the globe in your apartment.
别担心   那又不是美国的地球仪012---Don't worry, Chandler. It's not a globe of the United States.
嘿   我要去散个步012---Hey, you guys, I'm gonna go out and take a walk.
菲比  你的包包为什么在动012---Phoebe, why is your bag moving?
没有啊   它真的在动012---Oh, it's not. Seriously, it's moving.
里面装了什么东西   就是我编织的东西而已012---What the hell's in there?  It's just my knitting. That's all.
对   我织了这个012---Yes, I knit this.
我真的很厉害012---I'm very good.
罗斯的公寓很漂亮  为什么我们从不来这里混012---Ross' apartment is nice. Why don't we hang out here more often?
我不知道   或许是因为它有个怪味道012---I don't know. Maybe because it smells weird.
有点像是放了很久的南瓜味012---It's like old pumpkins or something.
那是我的派   这个味道好香012---That's my pie. Which smells delicious.
哇啊哦  怎么了012---Uh-oh. Uh-oh. What?
我们让乔伊跟食物独处了012---We left Joey alone with the food.
没错   我就知道012---Yep, yep, I knew it.
他在012---There he is...
拿馅料喂小狗吃012---...feeding stuffing to a dog.
你好  这里是盖勒及宾的家  有什么事吗012---Hi, Geller-Bing residence. How can I help?
菲比   为什么我们家会有狗012---Phoebe, why is there a dog in our apartment?
对不起   你是谁012---I'm sorry, who's this?
菲比  有只狗坐在我的沙发上012---Phoebe, there's a dog sitting on my couch.
告诉她我对狗过敏   我会告诉她的012---Tell her I'm allergic, and I will sue.
这里没有狗  不  真的有012---No, there's no dog here. Yes There is.
他是黑白相间   而且毛很长012---He's black and white and shaggy.
他就坐在瑞秋旁边  正在舔她的手012---He's sitting next to Rachel and licking Rachel's hand.
我的天啊   你在哪里012---Oh, my God. Where are you?
我马上回去012---I'll be right there.
他们已经回来了  怎么这么快啊012---They're here already? How are they doing this?
嗨  泰格  你来这里做什么012---Hi, Tag. What are you doing here?
我想知道你的邀请   是不是还有效012---I, uh, wanted to see if your offer to spend Thanksgiving with you was still good.
当然有效   快进来吧012---Well, sure. Come in.
你女朋友呢012---Well, what happened to your girlfriend?
今天早上我们分手了012---We, uh, kind of broke up this morning.
我很遗憾   所以她回俄亥俄去了012---Oh, I'm sorry. Yeah, so she went back to Ohio.
俄亥俄州  谢谢你012---Ohio, thank you.
狗在哪里012---Huh. Where's the dog?
什么狗  这里没有狗012---What dog? There's no dog here.
那只狗离开了012---Yeah, that dog left.
菲比012---Phoebe.
菲比   快开门012---Phoebe, open up.
房间里没有狗012---There's no dog in here.
菲比   我们听到了狗叫声了012---Phoebe, we can hear the dog barking.
不   那只是我的咳嗽声012---No, that's just me coughing.
很好  你们回来了012---Oh, good. There you are.
听着  我房间里有只狗012---Listen, urn, I have a dog in my room.
他在这里做什么012---What is it doing here?
我帮我朋友照顾他   他们有事出城去了012---I'm watching it for friends who went out of town.
等一下012---Wait.
嗨  我是克朗克012---Hello, my name is Klunkers.
我可以跟你们这些大好人住在一起吗012---May I please stay with you nice people?
我也希望能留他住下来   但钱德对狗过敏012---Oh, I wish he could stay here, but Chandler's allergic.
我对狗严重过敏   好吗012---Extremely allergic, okay?
只要我一靠近狗   超过五分钟012---If I am anywhere near a dog for more than five minutes...
我的喉咙就会紧缩012---...my throat will just close up.
真是奇怪   这只狗在这里住了三天012---That's odd, because this dog's been living here for the past three days.
真的吗012---Really?
如果他在这里住了那么久012---If the dog has been here that long...
你一点反应都没有   或许你对他不会过敏012---...and you haven't had a reaction, maybe you're not allergic to this dog.
他还是得离开   好吗012---Well, it still has to go, right?
为什么012---Why?
好吧   我   别那么做012---Okay, it's, um-Don't do it.
别做什么   我非说不可012---Don't do what? I have to.
好吗   时间到了012---Okay? It's time.
好吧   我讨厌狗012---Okay, I hate dogs.
什么   太疯狂了  为什么012---What? That's crazy. Why?
我早跟你说过了012---Told you.
他们很黏人012---They are needy...
爱乱跳   你不知道他们在想什么012---...they are jumpy, and you can't tell what they are thinking...
那样子把我吓得半死012---...and that scares me a little bit.
你说的对  他们很可怕012---You're right. They are scary. Aah!
他吃掉了放在我手上的点心012---She just ate a treat out of my hand!
等一下  你不喜欢所有的狗   连小狗都不喜欢吗012---Wait a minute. Do you not like all dogs? I mean, not even puppies?
这里有小狗吗012---Is there a puppy here?
你不喜欢小狗  喂  你是新来的012---You don't like puppies? Okay, you are new.
听着   钱德   我跟你说过  别跟其他人说你不喜欢狗012---Look, Chandler, I told you. Never tell anyone about this dog thing.
这就像罗斯不喜欢冰淇淋一样012---It's like Ross not liking ice cream.
你不喜欢冰淇淋   它太冰了012---You don't like ice cream? It's too cold.
狗也让我觉得很不舒服012---Okay, it's just that dogs make me a little uncomfortable.
我的牙齿冰得好痛012---Hurts my teeth.
我不想这么说   不希望你们讨厌我012---I don't wanna say this. I don't want you guys to hate me...
但我不喜欢这只狗  待在我身边  好吗012---...but, uh, I don't think I can be around that dog anymore, okay?
不是那只狗走   就是我走012---So either the dog goes or I go. Huh.
我的天啊012---Oh, my God.
我怎么可能答不出来012---How can I not get this?
我是大学教授  SAT了考了1450分012---I'm a college professor. I got 1450 on my SATs.
是1250分才对012---Twelve fifty.
该死   我忘了你在这里012---Damn, I forgot you were here.
好吧  我们得把克朗克送到罗斯家012---All right. We're gonna take Klunkers to Ross'.
马上就回来012---We'll be back in a minute.
等一下  你们离开前  我能问你们一个问题吗012---Oh, wait, before you go, can I ask a question?
如果一个男人跟女朋友分手了012---Um, when a guy breaks up with his girlfriend...
我得等多久才能采取行动012---...what is an appropriate amount of time to wait before you make a move?
我想是一个月012---Oh, I'd say about a month.
真的吗   我觉得是三到四个月  半小时012---Really? I'd say three to four. Half-hour.
真有趣012---Interesting.
但他是你的助理   我劝你别那么做012---When it's your assistant, I would say never.
好了   瑞秋  问题是他喜欢你吗012---All right, Rach, the big question is, does he like you?
如果他不喜欢你   这样做只是在对牛放屁012---Right? Because if he doesn't like you, this is all a moo point.
对牛 "放屁"012---Huh. A "moo" point?
对  牛不知道你做了什么012---Yeah. It's like a cow's opinion.
那不重要012---It just doesn't matter.
那是在 "放屁"012---It's "moo."
是我跟他同居太久   还是他的话真的有道理012---Have I been living with him for too long, or did that all just make sense?
别听乔伊的   好吗   看看他的样子012---Please don't listen to Joey. Okay? Would you look at him?
他很沮丧   家人又不在身边012---He's obviously depressed. He's away from his family.
他在跟陌生人过感恩节012---He's spending Thanksgiving with strangers.
现在他需要你这个朋友012---What he needs right now is for you to be his friend.
你说的对  对不起  谢谢012---Oh, you're right. I'm sorry. Thank you.
好吧  我会那么做的  很好  照她们的话去做012---Okay, that's what I'm going to do. Fine, take their advice.
反正没有人会听我的话012---No one ever listens to me.
只要包装好看  没有人会在乎内容012---When the package is this pretty, no one cares what's inside.
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
你还好吧012---How you holding up?
还可以  是吗012---Not bad. Yeah?
关于你女朋友的事我很遗憾   谢谢012---I'm sorry about your girlfriend. Thanks.
你们在一起很久了吗   一年了  总是分分合合的012---Were you guys together a long time? A year, on and off.
我以为我们会相守一生   现在我不会那么想了012---I thought we'd end up together. I don't anymore.
因为她跟你分手了   对012---Now that she broke up with you. Yeah.
这真的很奇怪012---Hmm. It's weird.
我以前总以为我会遇见一个人  坠入爱河  过着幸福的生活012---I always used to assume that I would meet someone and fall in love and be happy.
好像很自然而然  最近我会想如果不是那样呢012---That all that was just a given. Well, lately, it's like, what if it's not?
你有那种感觉吗012---Do you ever have that feeling?
不012---No.
有012---Yeah.
我常有那种感觉  一直都有  真的很可怕012---All the time. Constantly. It's terrifying.
但后来我想通了  一定会发生的012---But, you know, then I figure it has to work out.
为什么012---Why?
因为一定会的012---Because it has to.
你真的什么都知道  对吧  没错  我真的什么都知道012---You have all the answers, don't you? Yeah, I know, I do. I really do.
谢谢你陪我聊  别这样  这不是上司的工作吗012---Hey, thanks for talking to me. Come on, what are bosses for?
快来抱一下吧012---Hug it out.
好了  他也喜欢你012---All right, he likes you back.
我说过你该表白的012---Huh? Told you you should go for it.
什么012---What?
下面的噪音有没有盖过那句话012---Street noise drown any of that out?
没有吗  待会见  好吧012---No? All right, I'll see you later. Ha, ha. Okay.
刚刚乔伊说了什么   我也喜欢你012---What did Joey say? I like you back?
你知道的   他012---Uh, yeah-You know, well, see, he...
乔伊知道  我对我的背没信心012---Joey knows that I'm very insecure about my back.
刚刚你在抱我012---And... And you were hugging me...
很明显地   你不讨厌它   没错012---...so obviously you are not repulsed by it. Yeah. Heh.
等一下   那样根本说不通012---Wait a minute, that doesn't make any sense.
是吗012---No?
好吧   事实是这样的012---All right, here's the truth. Ahem.
乔伊会那么说012---Joey said what he said because, urn...
因为我被你吸引012---...I'm attracted to you.
对   我承认012---Wow. Yeah, I admit it.
我暗恋你  我知道那很疯狂  因为我们是同事012---I have a crush on you. And, uh, I know that's crazy because we work together...
我们之间不该发生任何事012---...and nothing could ever happen.
我一点都不想吓到你012---And the last thing I wanted to do was freak you out...
或是让你觉得不自在012---...or make you feel uncomfortable.
所以我认为  你最好快说句话012---Which is why it would be really great if you said something right about now.
我的天啊   那些家伙在偷我的车012---Oh, my God. Those guys are stealing my car.
什么   就在那边   那是我的车012---What? Right there. That's my car.
嘿   好了  他们得花点时间012---Hey! Okay, that's gonna take a minute.
你有话要跟我说吗012---Do you have anything else you wanna get off your chest?
我不敢相信012---I can't believe this.
我们还有时间谈   他们还没上车012---Wait, we still have time to talk, and they're not even in the car yet.
你看  他们上车了012---Oh, look, there they go. Okay.
好了  菲比   或许我们该回去了012---Okay, Phoebe. We should probably go back now.
求求你   别离开我   我会很寂寞的012---Please, don't leave me. I'll be lonely.
停了  别说了012---Stop it. Stop.
我们走吧   我们可以很坚强的   好吧012---Okay, let's go. We can be strong. Yeah, okay.
天啊   你听到了吗    他在叫 "摩妮卡"012---Oh, my God, did you hear that? She said "Monica."
我不能丢下他012---Oh, I can't leave her.
我们可以偷偷把狗带回去  钱德不会发现的012---If you want, we could sneak the dog back in and Chandler wouldn't even know.
那样怕是不行的012---That's not gonna work.
我把小狗藏在房间里三天了   钱德完全不知道012---I had that dog there for three days and Chandler had no idea.
他没有那么聪明012---He's not so smart.
嘿  我也不知道012---Hey. I didn't know either.
对  但是你觉得怪怪的  对吧012---Yeah, but you kind of knew that something was going on, didn't you?
没错   我知道012---Yeah, I knew. Heh.
钱德在哪里012---Where's Chandler?
我在这里   快去洗手012---Here I am. Wash your hands.
你怎么知道012---How did you know?
他怎么又回来了012---Hey, what's she doing back here?
别激动   罗斯   他不是冰淇淋做的012---Relax, Ross. She's not made of ice cream.
听着  菲比  我按照位置将各州州名排好了012---Hey, look, Phoebe. I, uh, laid out the states geographically.
没时间谈这事了012---No, no, we don't have time for this.
我们不能让钱德靠近我房间012---We have to keep Chandler away from my room.
对   但是012---Yeah, but, look what I--
所以我们没有时间了012---See, this is exactly what we do not have time for.
摩妮卡在哪里  她在菲比房里  你不能进去012---Where's Monica? Uh, in Phoebe's room. You can't go in.
为什么012---Why not?
摩妮卡在哭012---Monica's crying.
关于克朗克的事   她非常难过012---She's very upset about this whole Klunkers thing.
我应该进去的  不012---Well, I should go in there. No, no.
不   现在她不想见你012---No, she doesn't want to see you right now.
为什么   因为你把那只狗赶走了012---Why not? Because you sent away the dog.
太可笑了  是吗012---That's ridiculous. Oh, is it? Is it?
听着   小时候摩妮卡跟我养了一只狗叫路佛012---Look, when Monica and I were kids, we had a dog named Rover.
有一天  我爸决定不再喜欢狗了012---And, um, one day, my dad decides he doesn't like dogs.
摩妮卡跟她的朋友菲丽丝012---So Monica and her friend...Phyllis...
把狗送走  那是我们最后一次见到他  好吗012---...take away the dog, and that was the last time we ever saw him.
你懂吗  这次也一样012---Don't you see? This is just like that...
只不过有些细节不一样012---...only with a few details changed.
好吧   我换了运动裤012---Okay, I'm in my sweatpants.
把食物端上来吧012---Bring on the food.
怎么了   摩妮卡因为012---What's the matter? Monica's all upset...
克朗克的事很难过012---...because I sent Klunkers away.
所以呢  就把狗抱回来了  你会成为大英雄的012---So? Bring the dog back. You're a hero.
对  我可以当大英雄  我可以那么做  可以012---Yeah, I could be a hero. I could do that. I could. I could do...
万一他攻击我呢012---What if it--? What if it attacks me?
钱德   他就像只大沙鼠012---Chandler, it's like a big gerbil.
你不害怕吗012---And that doesn't scare you?
罗斯   需要帮忙吗012---Ross, you need some help?
你要帮我忙012---From you?
好的   拜托你了012---Yes, please.
首先   犹他州012---First of all, Utah?
兄弟   你不能乱编州名012---Dude, you can't just make stuff up.
我恨美国012---I hate America.
游戏结束后   我发誓我要搬家012---When I finish this game, I swear I am moving.
嘿   泰格还在跟警察谈   对012---Hey. Tag still talking to the police? Yeah.
该死   我为什么要说话012---Ugh, damn it. Why did I open my mouth?
"我暗恋你   我被你吸引"012---"I have a crush on you. I'm attracted to you."
我知道   我吓坏他了012---I know that I freaked him out.
如果你是那种口气  他一定吓坏了012---If you said it like that, you probably did, yeah.
嘿   钱德在吗012---Hey, is Chandler here?
不在   他去散步了012---Uh, no, no, he went for a walk.
好了  你们不能告诉他啊   看看是谁回来了012---Okay, well, you cannot tell him, but look who's back.
嗨   喔   不  不012---Hi. Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
他去罗斯家把小狗带回来了012---He went over to Ross' to bring the dog back here.

我忘了关门   他一定是跑出去了012---...and, ahem, I left the door open, and she must've gotten out.
我到处都找过了   找遍了整栋公寓   包括屋顶012---And I looked everywhere, all over the apartment, including the roof.

他爬上消防梯012---Then she climbed up the fire escape...
用他的小脚拍打窗户012---...and she tapped on the window with her teeny little paw...

我说的太过火了   对吧012---I went too far, didn't I?
我该在哪里就住口呢012---When should I have stopped?
好了  或许这个游戏很难  是因为美国没有五十州012---Okay, maybe this is so hard because there aren't 5O states.
我得告诉你一件事  我写出四十九州的州名012---Let me tell you something. I have 49 states.

我不该说那些话的012---I never should've said what I said.
我的感觉并不重要012---You know what? It just doesn't matter how I feel.
我们一起工作   不应该有任何私人关系012---We work together, so nothing could really ever happen between us.
星期一我想高高兴兴去上班   再也不提这件事了012---What I would love is just to go to work on Monday and never talk about this again.
