他会把颈部肌肉张开  发出尖锐的叫声012---...would expand its collar and emit a high-pitched noise...
将敌人吓跑012---...to frighten off its predator.
路易斯  什么事012---Yes, Mr. Lewis?
他是怎么叫的012---What kind of noise?
他会发出尖锐吵杂的声音012---Just a high-pitched, intimidating noise.
那到底是什么声音啊012---But like how?
我们不是很清楚012---Well, we-we don't know for sure.
但我想  应该是这样的012---But in my head, it sounded something like this, uh:
当然了  这只是一种推测012---Of course, this is just conjecture.
好了  今天的课就上到这里012---Ahem, okay. That's, uh, That's all for today.

恐怕我不能让你及格了   为什么012---I'm afraid I had to fail you. Why?
你得答对60%才能过关012---Well, you need 6O percent to pass.
我得了几分   7分012---What'd I get? Seven.
不算太好012---That's not so good.
不  不好  太糟了  奈德  到底怎么回事012---No, no, it's not. What happened there, Ned?
或许你可以放我一马  我恋爱了012---Well, maybe you can cut me some slack. I'm sort of in love.
很抱歉  但那真的不是我的问题012---Well I'm sorry, but that's really not my problem.
我爱上了你012---I'm in love with you.
这好像又跟我有一点关系了012---Well, that brings me in the loop a little.
看么  这就是我考砸的原因  我没办法专心上课012---See, that's why I did so bad on this test. I'm having a hard time concentrating.
你站在讲台上讲课的时候012---When you're up there and you're teaching...
表情是那么地严肃012---...and your face gets all serious...
你看起来好帅  当你穿着紧身套头毛衣时012---...you look so good. When you wear that tight little turtleneck sweater--

我的天啊  他真的好帅  过去泡他012---Oh, my God, he's really cute. Heh. Go for it.
菲比  我订婚了012---Phoebe, I'm engaged.
我是说让你问问他的电话号码  以防万一012---I'm just saying, get his number, just in case.
要是钱德发生什么意外  丧失了性能力012---But if Chandler is in an accident and can't perform sexually, you know...
他可能要你找个情人  满足他无法满足你的那个部分012---...then he would want you to take a lover to satisfy the needs he can no longer fulfill.
嗨  喔012---Hi. I-Oh.
我是不是应该先告诉你012---Can I just tell you something? Um--
我真的受宠若惊  但我订婚了012---I'm very flattered, but, uh, I'm engaged. Ha, ha.
这还真是有点尴尬012---Wow, uh-This is kind of embarrassing.
但实际上  我是想过来跟你朋友打个招呼012---I was actually coming over to talk to your friend.
你是该感到尴尬的012---Well, you should be embarrassed.
我以为你知道我在看你  我知道  真的很好玩012---I thought you knew I was looking at you. I did, but that was really fun.

我排在第四名  天啊012---I'm fourth? Jeez!
看看你  拿着你的枫糖奖012---Look at you with your little maple syrup award!
拜托你不要告诉别人这件事012---Yeah may-maybe you don't tell anyone about this.
什么  不012---What? No.
这没有什么大不了的  我也会拿着洗发精的瓶子那么做012---It's not a big deal. I do that too, with my shampoo bottle.
真的吗  没错012---Really? Yeah.
你练习的是什么奖  葛莱美奖012---What award are you practicing for? Grammy.
我是最佳新进艺人012---Best New Artist. Ooh.
肥皂奖的人今天打电话给我  我还得上台颁奖012---Oh, hey, listen. The Soapies people called today and I also get to present an award.
太好了  对啊012---Aw, that's great. Yeah.
所以就算你没得奖  你也有机会上台012---So you'll definitely get on stage even if you don't win.
你认为我不会得奖  你当然会得奖012---You-You don't think I'm gonna win? Of course I do.
但最受欢迎的死而后生奖  竞争很激烈012---But, you know, Favorite Returning Character is a tough category, Joey.
我是说你要跟一个从火葬场死里逃生的家伙竞争012---I mean, you're up against the guy who survived his own cremation.
是的  我知道或许可能会输  只是012---Yeah. No, I know I might not win. But it's just...
我从来没获得过提名  我太想得到这个奖了012---I've never even been nominated before. I want it so much.
乔伊  或许你会得奖012---Well Joey, and you'll probably get it.
但你应该开始练习  万一失败了应该有得体的表现012---But you should probably start practicing your "gracious-loser" face.
当摄影机拍到你时  你得表现出失望的样子012---Y'know when like, the cameras are on you and you wanna look disappointed...
但也得表现出对方是  实至名归的表情  就像这样012---...but also that your colleague deserved to win. Y'know? So it's sorta like...
你知道吗012---Hey. You know?
你也练习过失去格莱美奖  不  拿格莱美奖我从不失手012---You practice losing at the Grammys too? Oh, no, at the Grammys, I always win.
嘿  你跟杰克约会还顺利吗012---Oh, hey. Hey. How'd your date go with Jake?
太棒了  我们整晚一直注视着彼此012---Oh, great! We couldn't keep our eyes off each other all night.
每一次那个  你知道  他都俯下身来抚摸我的头发跟脖子012---Then every once and a while y'know, he'd lean over and stroke my hair, and then touch my neck.
好吧  别这样  菲比  你让我浑身发麻012---Okay, stop it. Phoebe, You're getting me all tingly.
我只能想着  他要吻我了吗  要吻我了吗012---All I could think of was, y'know, "Is he gonna kiss me? Is he gonna kiss me?"
他吻了你吗  我是个淑女啊  摩尼卡  我接吻的时候不说话012---And did he? I'm a lady, Monica. I don't kiss and tell.
但这个吻痕说明了一切012---But this hickey speaks for itself.
好了  我知道了  我知道了012---Okay, okay, I got it. I got it.
我真的好喜欢他  感觉上像是我今天喝了十杯酒012---I just like him so much that I just feel like I've had 1O drinks today.
而我只喝了六杯012---And I've only had six.
我第一次跟钱德约会后  就再也没有那样的感觉了012---Oh. You know, I haven't had that feeling since I first starting going out with Chandler.
我永远都不会再有那样的感觉了  你的口气像个男人012---Wow, I'm never gonna have that feeling again am I? You sound like a guy.
不  男人会说 "我永远都不能再跟别人上床了"012---Heh. No, a guy would be saying, "I'm never gonna get to sleep with anyone else." Heh.
我永远都不能再跟别人上床了012---Oh, my God. I'm never gonna sleep with anyone else!
我一直忙着筹备婚礼  完全忘了我要放弃什么012---I've been so busy planning the wedding, I forgot about all the things that I'd be giving up.
我再也不会有初吻012---I mean, I'm never gonna have a first kiss again.
你会有最后的吻别012---You'll have a last kiss.
我能问你一件事吗  有男人喜欢过你吗012---Can I ask you something? You ever had a guy have a crush on you?
那就是你要帮我打领带的原因012---Is that why you wanted to tie my tie?
我班上的学生说他爱上我了012---There's this kid in my class who said he's in love with me.
哇012---Whoa! Yeah.
哇  什么  罗斯有男朋友了012---Whoa, what? Ross has a boyfriend.
我没有男朋友012---I do-I do not have a boyfriend.
我班上有个男学生暗恋我012---There's a guy in one of my classes who has a crush on me.
真的吗  对  我不知道012---Really? Yeah. I don't know.
去年是伊莉莎白  现在是这个孩子012---I mean, last year, Elizabeth, now this kid...
这是怎么回事啊  难道是我浑身散发出012---What-What-What is it? Am I giving out some kind of...
一股性感教授的气质吗012---...a sexy-professor vibe?
现在看起来不像012---Not right now.
重点是我的天生丽质  让他期中考试不及格012---It-it—The point is, my natural charisma has made him fail his midterm.
我替那个孩子感到难过012---Aw, see now I feel bad for the kid.
我也曾经暗恋过老师  那个真的很难受012---I had a crush on a teacher once, and it was so hard, you know.
我没办法专心上课  每次他看着我时  我都会脸红012---I couldn't concentrate and I blushed every time he looked at me.
你还记得19岁时的恋爱滋味吧012---Come on, you remember what it's like to be 19 and in love.
我是可以放他一马  太棒了012---Yeah, guess I can cut him some slack. Yeah.
你怎么忘记那个老师的  我没有012---How'd you get over that teacher? I didn't.
我跟他上床了012---I got under him.
问题解决了012---Problem solved.
再见  菲比  好的  再见012---Bye,Phoebe. Okay, bye.
好的  再见  再见012---All right. Bye. Bye.
我们在门口说再见  不想太招摇012---We said goodbye at the door so as not to flaunt our new love.
菲比  没关系  你不必顾虑到我012---Phoebe, it's okay. You don't have to tip toe around me.
我已经想过了  你知道吗012---I've been thinking about it, and um-You know what?
我可以接受没有心动感觉的恋爱生活012---I'm okay about not having that new-relationship feeling.
我已经开始想你了  我也会想你012---I miss you already! I miss you too!
看见了  这就是我说的  真的太棒了  但我不会拿我的幸福跟你交换012---See, that's what I mean. I mean that, That's great, but I wouldn't trade in what I have for that.
我会一辈子跟钱德相守012---I mean, I'm gonna be with Chandler for the rest of my life.
那会让我觉得幸福012---That's what makes me happy. Mm-hm.
嗨  亲爱的  过来  过来坐这  我和菲比正在谈012---Hey, sweetie, come here, Come sit down. Hey Phoebe and I were just talking about how our relationship is...
我们的关系有多深厚  多有意义  真的是那样  你觉得呢012---...deep and meaningful. It really is, don't you think?

你看我拿了什么回家012---Look what I won! Ha-ha-ha.
我的天啊  你偷走她的奖杯012---Oh, my God. You stole her award.
不  我代表她收下它012---No, no, no. I'm accepting it on her behalf.
乔伊  我想你不知道"代表"是什么意思012---Joey I don't think you know what "behalf" means.
我当然知道  它是个动词  意思是"我能分一半"012---Sure I do. It's a verb. As in "I be half-in' it"!
乔伊012---Joey"
你得把它还回去  凭什么啊  我应该得奖的  我好想得奖012---You have got to take this back. But why?! I should've won one. I really wanted it.
她根本不在乎才没有出席  它也可以拿来当葛莱美012---She didn't even care enough to come to the thing. It could also be a Grammy.
不  乔伊012---No, Joey.
拜托  瑞秋  没有人看到我把它拿走  整个桌子上都是奖杯012---Come on, Rach. No one saw me take it. There was a whole table full of them.
你想要一个不属于你的奖杯吗012---Do you really want an award that you didn't win?
不  我当然想要一个属于我的奖杯  可是没人愿意让我得奖012---No, I want an award I did win. But nobody's given me any of those!

以为我真的得奖了012---...and they'll think I won it.
乔伊  上面写着"最佳女配角奖"012---Joey, it says "Best Supporting Actress."
我可以把那个刮掉012---I can scratch that right off.
乔伊  这样是不对的  你得把它还回去012---Joey, no, this is wrong. You have to take it back.
你不会想这样把奖杯拿回家  你真的有演戏天分012---Okay? You don't wanna win an award this way. You're very talented.

我知道我的期中考没有考好012---I know I didn't do well on my midterms and stuff...
但我希望你能帮我改成绩012---...but I was kind of hoping you could change my grade.
我为什么要那么做012---And why exactly would I do that?
因为我爱上你了012---Because I'm in love with you.
什么012---What?
对  因为我爱上你了012---Yeah. I'm all in love with you and stuff.
你可以帮我改成绩吗  不行012---So could you change my grade? No!
为什么你帮奈德改成绩012---Well, why not? You changed Ned's grade.
那不一样  因为他真的爱上我了012---Well, that's different, okay? Because he was actually in love with me.
不  他才没有呢  他只是在耍你012---No, he's not! He's totally yanking your chain.
他已经用这一招对付过其他三个教授了012---He's done this with three other teachers.
什么  他有女朋友012---What? He's got a girlfriend.
我不敢相信有人会为了成绩那么做012---I can't believe someone would do that for a grade.
我知道012---I know.
那太可怕了012---It's awful.
我爱你012---I love you.
你看到钱德了吗  没有  干嘛012---Have you seen Chandler? No, why?
因为我一直在想  我会失去的一切012---'Cause I just keep thinking about all these things I'm not gonna have...
我真的吓坏了  我不知道该怎么办012---...and it's freaking me out. I don't know what to do about it.
别担心012---Okay. Don't sweat it.
钱德不在  别管那么多规矩了  那个男的很帅012---Chandler is nowhere around, so go ahead get it out of your system. That guy's cute.
菲比  别这样  我是认真的012---Phoebe, come on, I'm serious.
我得跟他谈这件事  不  这是你最后的选择012---I've just gotta talk to him about all this. No that is the last thing you wanna do.
为什么  因为你要嫁给他012---Why? Because you're marrying him!
你得说清楚  菲比012---You gotta help me out here, Pheebs.
我从来没有订过婚  也没有真正结过婚012---All right, I've never been engaged and I've never really been married.
我只能告诉你我妈跟我说的话012---But I can only tell you what my mother told me.
当你对一段关系有疑虑  害怕或焦虑时012---Whenever you have doubts or fears or anxieties about a relationship...
别跟你的丈夫沟通这些问题012---...do not communicate them to your husband.
所以  我不该跟我要共度一生的男人012---So I'm not supposed to share my doubts and fears...
分享我的疑虑跟恐惧012---...with the guy I'm spending the rest of my life with?
没错  就是那样012---That is correct. Yes.
你应该把那件事放在心里012---You're supposed to take all of that stuff and put it in a little box in your mind...
永远不再提012---...and then lock it up tight.
那是你妈妈告诉你的  对012---Your mother told you this? Yes.
那个结了很多次婚  在你十三岁时就自杀了的女人012---The woman that got married a bunch of times and killed herself when you were 13?
我的天啊  你说的对012---Oh, my God, you're right.
去啊  去告诉钱德  快点  免得太迟了012---Go! Go tell Chandler. Hurry, before it's too late!
等一下  这是不是说你对做爱不感兴趣了012---Wait, no! Does this also mean that putting out doesn't get you love?
不敢相信我要跟洁西卡艾许丽碰面  等下  等下012---I can't believe I'm gonna meet Jessica Ashley! Wait, wait.
瑞秋  冷静一点  好吗  我跟这个女人一起工作012---Please be cool, okay? I work with this woman.
好吧  我会很冷静的012---Okay, I'm totally cool. Okay.
请进012---Come in.
嘿  洁西卡012---Hey, Jessica.
嘿  洁西012---Hey, Jess.
她是我朋友瑞秋012---Ah, this is my friend Rachel.
嗨  你好吗012---Hi. What's up?
这是你的肥皂奖  我代表你收下了它012---Uh, listen, here's your Soapie. I accepted it for you.
我的天啊  我得奖了  你知道这代表什么吗012---Oh, my God. I won? Do you have any idea what this means?
就这样么  你不打算  你不把它摆在柜子里或者其他什么上吗012---Well, that-that-that's it? You're gonna, you're not gonna put it on your shelf or anything?
不  我只想把真正的奖杯摆在柜子里  对不起012---No, I try to save that for real awards. Now if you'll excuse me?
要把它拿回去吗  那当然012---Take it back? Absolutely.
对  做得好012---Yeah, you do.
甜心  我们快结婚了012---Honey? As we get closer to the wedding... Hm?
