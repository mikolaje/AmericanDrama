我约你们来吃早午餐的原因012---Okay, the reason why I asked you guys out to brunch today...
是因为我一直在想伴娘的问题012---...is because I have been doing some thinking about who should be my maid of honor.
我的天啊   这一刻终于等到了012---Oh, my God. This is it. Oh.
我希望是你012---I really hope it's you!
我希望是你  我也是012---I hope it's you. Me too.
首先  我非常爱你们012---First of all, I love you both so much.
你们对我来说都很重要   废话少说   到底是谁012---and you're both so important to me. Okay, Blah, blah, blah. Who is it?
我想  我们可以想出一个办法012---Well umm, I was thinking that maybe we could come up with a system...
轮流当彼此的伴娘012---...where we trade off being maid of honor for each other.
假设菲比是我的伴娘  太棒了012---Like hypothetically, if Phoebe were mine-Yes! Oh.
那只是假设012---Hypothetically.
一样啦012---Still.
如果菲比是我的伴娘   瑞秋  是菲比的伴娘   我是瑞秋的伴娘012---If Phoebe were my maid of honor. Rachel would be Phoebe's, I'd be Rachel's.
这样我们都可以当伴娘   没有人会难过012---that way we all get to do it once and no one would get upset.
是个好办法   我要参加   谁会是你的伴娘呢012---That's actually a pretty good idea. Yeah, I'll do that. So who gets to be yours?
不过那是最棒的  你们得决定谁来当我的伴娘012---Well, that's the best part. You guys get to decide.
为什么那是最棒的   这样我就不必决定了012---Why is that the best part? Because then I don't have to.
当然我们会帮你决定   我们会尽力帮你的012---Of course we'll help you decide. We'll do anything we can to help you.
我想要举杯012---I'd like to make a toast.
敬未来的钱德宾太太012---To the future Mrs. Chandler Bing...
我最好的朋友跟最棒的012---...my best friend and truly one of the nicest people that--
我真的还没有决定   好吧012---Really not deciding. Fine.
对不起   我不是故意要偷听的012---Excuse me, I couldn't help overhearing.
你要嫁给钱德宾   对啊012---You're marrying Chandler Bing? Yeah that's right.
祝你好运012---Huh, Good luck!
我也祝你好运012---Oh, and good luck to you too!
她真是好心啊012---What a nice lady.
老友记   第七季  第06集  午睡的同伴012---Friends  S07E06  The One With The Nap Partners
太棒了012---Yeah!
《终极警探》 还是很好看的  没错012---Die Hard, still great. Yep.
要看第二支片子吗012---Hey, what do you say we make it a double feature?
你还租了什么012---What else did you rent?
《终极警探续集》012---Die Hard 2.
乔伊   这也是《终极警探1》012---Joey, this is Die Hard 1 again.
我们要再看一遍  那就等于是《终极警探续集》了012---Well, we'll watch it a second time and it's Die Hard 2.
乔伊  我们刚刚才看完续集  所以呢012---Joey, we just saw it. And?
再看一次一定很酷012---And it'll be cool to see it again!
太棒了  《终极警探》 《终极警探》012---Yeah! Die Hard! Die Hard!
兄弟   你没有说《终极警探》012---Dude, you didn't say Die Hard.
你还好吗012---Is everything okay?
还好  只是我有别的事要做012---Yeah, I just got uh, got plans.
约翰麦克连也有别的事要做012---Well, John McClane had plans.
我想在乔伊大开杀戒012---No, see the thing is I want to get out of here before Joey gets all worked up...
开始叫大家"混蛋"前离开012---...and starts calling everybody "bitch."
你在胡说什么啊   混蛋012---What are you talking about, bitch?
嘿   瑞秋  什么事012---Hey, Rachel. Yeah?
我结婚时  你愿意当我的伴娘吗012---When I get married, will you be my maid of honor?
真的吗012---Really?
我的天啊   我是说我   菲比012---Oh, my God, Phoebe. I mean, I'm just--
等一下012---Wait a minute.
如果我是你的伴娘   那就表示你是摩妮卡的伴娘012---If I'm your maid of honor, that means that you are Monica's.
喔012---Oh.
如果你真的想那么做   随便你了012---Well, if that's what you want. Oh!
想都别想   菲比   我想当摩妮卡的伴娘012---No way, Phoebe. I want to be Monica's.
为什么这件事这么重要   那你为什么觉得这么重要呢012---But why does it even matter? Why does it matter so much to you?
因为她马上就要结婚了012---Because this one is now.
我们两个最好的朋友要结婚了012---And it's two of our best friends.
谁知道你会嫁给什么样的人012---And who knows what you're gonna marry.
如果我嫁给罗斯呢   或乔伊012---What-what if I marry Ross? Or Joey?
你不会的012---You wouldn't.
好吧  听我说  瑞秋  我知道你真的想当摩妮卡的伴娘012---Okay, look, Rachel. I know you really want to do this...
但我从来没有当过伴娘012---...but I've never been maid of honor to anyone before.
我知道你至少当过两次伴娘012---I know you've done it at least twice.
对  但是菲比  请你让我把话说完012---Yeah, but, Phoebe. And no, oh please, oh please let me finish.
我猜我已经说完了012---I guess that was it.
好吧012---0Kay.
好   既然你没有当过伴娘   你可以当摩妮卡的伴娘012---Okay. Since you've never done it before, you can be Monica's maid of honor.
谢谢你012---Oh, thank you so much!
好啊012---Yay.
我一定会嫁个好男人012---I'm gonna marry someone good y'know.
我知道012---Oh, I know.
比钱德还棒012---Better than Chandler.
发生了什么事   我不知道012---What happened? I don't know.
我们睡着了  就那么简单012---We fell asleep. That is all.
对  对吗  对012---Yeah. Yeah? Yeah.
好了  我得走了012---All right, well, I'd better go.
那最好了   没错012---I think that would be best. Yeah.
我待会再跟你谈   好012---I'll talk to you later. Okay.
但千万别谈这件事  没错  永远都别提  永远012---But not about this. No, never. Never!
所以012---So, uh... Uh...
再见   别碰我   别碰我012---Bye. No touch. No touch.
我吃早午餐时  发生了一件怪事012---Hey, a weird thing happened today when I was at brunch.
有个女人不经意听到   我要嫁给你012---This woman overheard that I was marrying you...
她跑来祝我好运012---...and she wished me good luck.
太好了012---That's sweet.
不   她的意思是  "祝你好运"012---No, it was more like a "good luck."
那个女人长什么样012---So, what did this woman look like?
大概三十岁   深色头发  很漂亮012---She was like 30, dark hair, attractive.
你该不会是刚好看到一种  叫做镜子的东西吧012---Well, is there any chance you were looking into a bright, shiny thing called a mirror?
她会是你大学时的女朋友吗012---Come on, was it somebody maybe you dated in college?
不   在大学时   我只交过两个女朋友012---No, no I only dated two girls in college...
她们都是金发  也不漂亮012---...both blond, both not attractive.
等等   让我看看012---Hold on one second. Let me check this out.
你在做什么  来瞧瞧吧012---What are you doing? Well, let's see.
好吧  是她吗012---Okay, uh, is that her?
我的天啊   没错012---Oh, my God, yes!
她是谁  菜丽葛扛菲   我的夏令营女朋友012---Who is she? Julie Graff, my camp girlfriend.
你跟她分手了012---Did you break up with her?
不   我们还在一起012---No, we're still together.
我们交往了两个暑假   后来我跟她分手了012---We went out for two summers and then I broke up with her.
为什么  第三年的暑假012---Why? She came back the third summer...
她变得有一点012---...and she'd gotten really fa-aa-aw-ow...
胖  我没有那么说012---Fat? I did not say fat.
我是说012---I said "Fa-aa-aw-ow…"
你只因为女生胖   就跟她分手012---You broke up with a girl because she was fat?
对  对啊012---Yeah. Yeah.
但那真的是很久以前的事了   她还在难过吗012---But it was a really, really long time ago. Does she still feel bad?
看起来是的012---Well, apparently she does.
有句俗话说  "大象永远都不会忘记"012---You know what they say, "Elephants never forget."
说真的  要嫁给我  祝你好运012---Seriously, good luck marrying me.
嘿  发生了什么事012---Hey, what's going on?
菲比会是摩妮卡的伴娘012---Phoebe is gonna be Monica's maid of honor.
希望这次会比上次  你帮楼下那个女孩当伴娘顺利  记得吗012---Hey. Well I hope it goes better than the last time you did it for that girl downstairs, remember?
你以前当过伴娘012---You have been maid of honor before?
你看吧  那就是人不能说谎的原因012---You see? This is exactly why you shouldn't lie.
够了   我是伴娘012---All right that's it. I am maid of honor.
不   我才是  为什么是你012---No, I am. How come you are?
因为我在乎到不惜说谎012---Because I cared enough to lie.
我可以帮你们决定   该由谁来当伴娘012---Hey-hey-hey-hey, I could help you decide who should do it.
我们应该办个甄试会012---We could have like uh, like an audition
看看你们当伴娘时   遇到突发事件会怎么处理012---and see how you'd handle maid-of-honor-type situations.
你是什么意思   当我需要一份工作时012---What are you talking about? Like when I want a job...
我会去试镜   如果他们觉得我是最棒的012---...I go to an audition and if I'm the best of the people they see...
我就可以演出012---...they give me the part.
好了  甄试完毕后  谁来决定伴娘人选012---Okay, so after this audition, who decides who gets it?
我跟罗斯可以当评审012---Oh, me and Ross can be the judges.
这要比让我们自己来决定好   这太疯狂了012---It's better than us deciding. Oh, come on! this is crazy.
我们不能丢铜板决定吗   不   铜板恨我012---Can't we just flip a coin? No, coins hate me.
好吧  你知道吗  我们让罗斯跟乔伊来决定012---Okay, Okay fine, You know what? We will let Ross and Joey decide.
嗨012---Hi!
罗斯  甜心012---Ross, sweetie.
你好  大帅哥012---Hey there, you handsome thing.
这种古龙水的确跟亚曼尼的一样棒012---Wow, this cologne really is every bit as good as Giorgio.
嘿012---Hey.
我把录影带拿来还你012---Just brought back your videos.
罗斯  听着  我想我们需要谈谈之前的事了012---Hey, Ross. Look, I think we need to talk about before.
不  千万别提那件事012---No. No, we don't.
不  我们非谈不可012---Yes, we do.
好了  听我说  那是我睡得最香甜的一觉了012---Now, look. That was the best nap I ever had.
我不知道你在说什么012---I don't know what you're talking about.
少来了  承认吧012---Come on, admit it.
那是你睡过最香甜的一觉012---That was the best nap you ever had.
我有过更棒的经验012---I've had better.
好吧  什么时候012---Okay. When?
好吧  好吧  那是我睡过最香甜的一觉012---All right! All right! It was the best nap ever!
我承认  好吗012---Ah! I said it, okay?
但那都已经过去了  乔伊012---But it's over, Joey!
我想再来一次012---I want to do it again.
我们不能再来一次012---We can't do it again.
为什么   因为那样子太奇怪了012---Why not? Because it's weird!
好吧012---Fine.
你想喝点东西吗012---You want something to drink?
好啊  你有什么  温牛奶跟抗组胺药(帮助睡眠的)012---Sure. What do you got? Warm milk and Excedrin PM.
钱德012---Chandler.
我刚刚才知道你是谁012---Chandler! I just figured out who you are.
你知道我在做什么吗012---Can you figure out what I'm doing?
你是路易斯波森   谁012---You're Louis Posen. Who?
路易斯波森   他是我五年级时最好的朋友012---Lewis Posin!  He was my best friend in fifth grade.
有一天我要他当我男朋友   他拒绝了012---and-and then one day, I asked him to be my boyfriend and he said no.
你知道为什么吗012---Do you know why?
因为他上厕所时  你一直在跟他说话012---Because you kept talking to him while he was trying to go to the bathroom?
不   因为他觉得我太012---No, but because he thought I was too faaaaa...
每次想到这件事   我还是会觉得很难过012---And every time I think about it, I feel as bad as I did in fifth grade!
我真的觉得你该跟茱丽道歉012---Y'know, I-I really think you should apologize to Julie.
甜心  你在开玩笑吗  那是十六年前的事012---Honey, are you kidding? That was like 16 years ago.
如果路易斯能跟我道歉  我会觉得好过一点012---No, I know. But y'know what? It would make me feel better if Louis apologized to me.
好  我会跟她道歉  但我可警告你  这可能会让我变成更棒的男人012---Okay, I'll do it. But I warn you, this may make me a better person.
但那不是你爱上的那个男人012---And that is not the man you fell in love with.
好吧  我们会假设突发状况012---Okay, all right, this is how it's gonna work.
来考验你们当伴娘的资格012---We'll give you hypothetical maid-of-honor situations.
计分范围从1分到10分012---and you will be scored on a scale of one to 10.
1分是最高分  不  10分才是最高分012---One being the highest. No, Ten is the highest.
为什么10分是最高分   因为它是最大的数字012---Why is 10 the highest? Because it's the highest.
好了   瑞秋   你先来012---Okay, Rachel, you're up first.
1号突发状况   你跟摩妮卡在一起012---Situation number one: You're with Monica.
婚礼就要开始了  摩妮卡想临阵脱逃  开始012---The wedding is about to start when Monica gets cold feet. Go!
我不想嫁给钱德012---I don't want to marry Chandler.
我想临阵脱逃  没事的012---I've got cold feet. It's gonna be okay.
跟一个男人共度一生   我不知道我是否办得到012---No, One man the rest of my life? I don't know if I can do it.
这表示我永远都不能跟乔伊上床了012---This means I'll never get to sleep with Joey.
听我说  摩妮卡012---Look, Monica...
临阵脱逃是常见的事012---...getting cold feet is very common.
那是因为你期待过高012---Y'know, It's just because of all the anticipation.
你只要记住你爱钱德012---And you just have to remember that you love Chandler.
我也逃过婚012---And also, I ran out on a wedding.
逃婚的人得退还礼物012---You don't get to keep the gifts.
很好  你引述亲身经验012---Very good, drawing on your own experience.
非常好012---Very good.
没错   很好   瑞秋012---Yes, very nice, Rachel.
谢谢评审012---Thank you, judges.
马屁精  喔012---Ugh, what a kiss ass. Oh.
好了  菲比  是的  大人012---Okay, Phoebe. Yes, Your Honor.
婚礼进行到一半012---We're now in the ceremony.
摩妮卡正要说 "我愿意" 的时候012---Monica is about to say, "I do"...
她叔叔喝得烂醉   开始乱说乱叫012---...when her drunk uncle starts yelling.
你会怎么做  开始012---What do you do? Go!
摩妮卡还小的时候012---When Monica was a little girl...
我记得012---...I remember that
好痛012---Ow!
非常好  喔012---Very good! Oh.
好极了  我给你满分012---Yes, excellent. Perfect score.
等等   她破坏了正在进行中的婚礼012---Wait a minute! She just made a scene in the middle of the ceremony!
嘿   你想尝尝菲比的厉害吗012---Hey, Do you want a little taste of Pheebs?
现在你们得以伴娘的身分  说出对新人的贺词012---It is time for you to give your maid-of-honor speech.
等等  我们还没有准备012---Ohh, wait a minute, We haven't even prepared--
开始   好吧012---Go! Okay, okay, okay. Um...
韦伯斯特大字典   对婚姻的定义是012---Umm, Webster's Dictionary defines marriage as--
好了  不  忘了它  那段贺词太烂了  别在意  忘了它吧012---Okay, no! Forget that! That sucks! Okay, never mind. Forget it. Urn, um...
我遇见我认识的摩妮卡时   她还只是六岁大的小女孩012---I met-I met Monica when we were just a couple of 6-year-olds...
钱德25岁时  我们成了朋友012---...and became friends with Chandler when he was 25...
虽然他看起来  很像六岁大的孩子012---...although he seemed like a 6-year-old.
喔  太好了012---Oh. That’s nice.
谢谢   感激不尽012---Thank you. Thank you very much. Um...
我看过他们单身  跟交往时的样子012---I've known them separately and I've known them together.
我知道他们交往时   深爱着彼此012---and-and to know them as a couple is to know that you are truly in the presence of love.
现在我想举杯012---So I would like to raise my glass...
敬摩妮卡跟钱德012---...to Monica and Chandler...
还有他们要携手共度的  美好冒险历程012---...and the beautiful adventure they are about to embark upon together.
我认为他们做好了万全的准备  要展开这段旅程012---I can think of no two people better prepared for the journey.
哇012---Wow.
说的好  没错  真的很棒012---Great speech. Yeah, it really was.
谢谢012---Oh, thanks.
好了  菲比  下一个是你  虽然我觉得那么做是多余的012---Okay, Phoebe, I guess you're next. Although I really don't see the point.
好吧012---0Kay.
我不敢相信摩妮卡跟钱德要结婚了012---I can't believe that Monica and Chandler are getting married.
我还记得  我跟瑞秋谈过这一天012---I remember talking about this day with Rachel...
那时我们一起冲澡  全身一丝不挂012---...while we were showering together, naked.
这就算她后来居上了012---And she's back in the game!
茱丽   嗨012---Julie. Hi.
我是钱德宾   我猜你还记得我012---Chandler Bing. I guess you remember me.
你好  备胎012---Hello, Skidmark.
那是我的绰号  待会再跟你解释012---It's a nickname. I'll explain later.
我看得出原因012---It's pretty clear.
我很早以前就该跟你道歉了012---I owe you a long-overdue apology.
我不该只因为你很胖  就跟你分手012---I shouldn't have broken up with you because you were overweight.
那是你跟我分手的原因012---That's why you broke up with me?
你不知道啊012---You didn't know that?
看来我的任务已经达成012---Well, I guess my work here is done.
但首先我要说  你们两个都表现的很好012---All right, well first of all, I would like to say you both performed very well,
好吗  你们应该觉得骄傲012---okay? You should be proud of yourselves.
我还想说在这场比赛里  没有人是输家012---And I'd also like to say, that in this competition, there are no losers.
瑞秋除外  该死012---Well, except Rachel. Damn it!
真的吗   我赢了012---Really? I won?
什么   对不起   瑞秋   分数真的很接近012---What? I'm sorry, Rash, it was, it was really close.
那么我要求重新计分   事实上也没有那么接近012---Well, then I demand a recount! Actually, it wasn't that close.
你知道吗   不  不  反正你们的方法太愚蠢了012---No! You know what? No! No! Your thing was so stupid anyway.
我们来丢铜板决定   好吗012---this was ridiculous, We're gonna flip a coin, all right?
正面012---Heads. Oh!
什么  铜板终于原谅我了012---What? The coins have finally forgiven me!
你知道吗  我希望摩妮卡会原谅你   因为你会用012---Well You know what? I hope Monica forgives you after you throw her...
用怪力乱神的素食主义方式   对着她洒花片012---...her vegetarian-voodoo-goddess-circle-y shower.
瑞秋  没关系的  你们帅呆了012---Rach, it's gonna be okay. You guys are the best!
天啊  我得告诉你  当评审真的把我累坏了012---Boy, I tell you. That judging stuff took a lot out of me.
是吗  没错012---Yeah? Yeah.
我想或许我该上楼去   在我的沙发上好好睡一觉012---I was thinking about maybe going upstairs and taking a little nap on my couch.
那关我什么事012---Why would I care about that?
不为什么   我只是说012---No reason. I'm just saying that...
我会在那里012---...that's where I'll be.
虽然结局不如预期中理想   事实上我很满意自己的表现012---As bad as that went, I actually enjoyed myself.
我想我要为我做过的所有蠢事道歉012---I think that I'm going to apologize for all the stupid things that I do.
你为什么不改掉做蠢事的习惯呢012---Why don't you just stop doing stupid things?
那样子你就不必道歉了   我希望可以从两件事起做012---Then you wouldn't have to apologize. I'd love it if I could do both.
好吧   我得问你012---All right, I have to ask.
什么012---What?
如果我变胖了  你会跟我分手吗012---Are you gonna break up with me if I get fat again?
什么012---What?
你跟茱丽分手  她变得有多胖呢012---Well, you broke up with Julie Grath! How much weight could she have gained?
她胖了一百四十五磅012---A hundred and forty-five pounds.
在一年之内012---In one year?
天啊  她吃了什么  她的家人吗012---My God, what did she eat? Her family?
那不是重点012---That's not the point.
我知道那样跟别人分手太蠢了  但当时我才十五岁012---Look I know it was a stupid reason to break up with someone, but I was 15.
对  不只15岁的男孩觉得肥胖是个问题012---Yeah, well, that's not the only time this was an issue.
你还记得  你跟我们一起过感恩节的事吗012---You remember when you spent Thanksgiving with us?
你骂我胖012---You called me fat.
等一下012---Okay. Okay, now wait a minute
那完全是另一回事   怎么说012---That was totally different. How?
你不该听到那句话  我是在你背后偷偷说的012---You were not supposed to hear that. I said that behind your back.
如果我怀孕了呢   我会变得跟现在不一样012---What if I have babies, okay? I'm gonna look different.
我可以接受那样的事   但我不相信你能做到012---I'm okay with that, but I'm not sure you are.
你得了解我不认为   你是个苗条的大美女012---Look you have to realize I don't think of you as a thin, beautiful woman.

对012---Yeah.
瑞秋  我认为你应该当摩妮卡的伴娘012---Y'know Rach, I think that you should be Monica's maid of honor.
真的吗012---You do?
