她在那儿20分钟了  难道你没听到吗012---Yeah, She's been there for 2O minutes. I'm surprised you didn't hear her on the way over.
我还以为有个小孩在叫  "我是同性恋  我是同性恋"012---Oh, I thought it was a kid yelling, "I'm gay! I'm gay!"
可以带她进来了吗   让她去吧  好感人的012---Can I bring her in'? Oh no, Let her stay out there. It's sweet.
我要结婚了  我要做新娘了012---I'm getting married! I'm gonna be a bride!
闭嘴012---Shut up.
不   我不闭嘴   因为我订婚了012---No, I will not shut up, because I'm engaged!
大声点   你敢上来当面告诉我012---Oh, big talk! Why don't you come here and say that to me? Huh, buddy?!
看我未婚夫不教训你012---Yeah, My fiance will kick your ass.

没关系  我愿意这是你的特别的一晚012---It's okay, I want this to be your night too.

你决定婚礼用的乐团了吗   我也能做音乐演出的012---So have you decided on a band for the wedding, because I'm kind of musical.
她几小时前才订的婚   我想她还没时间去想012---Yeah, honey, she just got engaged a couple of hours ago. I doubt she's had time to think about...
提到合奏  记得有人烧了我的房子吗012---Speaking of chiming in, remember the time you burned down my apartment?
是  你自求多福012---Yeah, you're on your own.
知道我们该怎么做吗  我们换衣服出门  去广场饭店喝香槟012---Y'know what we should do? We should all get dressed up and go have champagne at the Plaza.
喔  好啊  对012---Oh, okay! Yeah.
我不能待的太晚了012---But I-I-I can't stay too long,
要早起去试镜广告   精神状态必须要好012---I gotta get up early for a commercial audition tomorrow. I gotta look good.
我要演一个19岁的人012---I'm supposed to be playing a 19-year-old.
什么012---What?
你说要早起  是指1986年012---So when you said get up early, did you mean 1986?
你们不觉得我像19岁012---You guys don't think I look 19?
19   我们以为你说90012---Oh, 19! We thought you said 90.
好了  大伙儿  走吧012---Okay, everybody, let's go. Let's go! Okay.
我剩下的糖还在吗012---Hey, is uh the rest of my candy bar around here?
没了  你吃完了012---Oh honey no, you ate it all.
我就怕会这样012---I was afraid of that.
你知道什么样的鞋子  能配这只戒指012---You know what shoes would look great with this ring?
钻石鞋子012---Diamond shoes.
你还没换衣服012---You're not getting dressed.
知道我的意思吧012---Know what I mean?
知道  不过没时间了012---Yeah, but I don't think we have time.
要举行婚礼了012---There's gonna be a wedding.
你要做新娘了012---You're gonna be the bride.
有200人会看到你穿着白纱012---Two hundred people are gonna be looking at you in a clean, white dress.
来吧012---Let's do it.
钱德  很多人都会这样012---Chandler, it happens to lots of guys.
你累了  喝了太多香槟012---You're probably tired, you had a lot of champagne.
别担心012---Don't worry about it.
我不担心  我很惊讶012---I'm not worried. I'm fascinated.
知道吗  就像生物学一样012---You know? It's like biology.
很好笑   高中时我的生物不及格012---Which is funny, because in high school I failed biology...
今晚生物学报复我了012---...and tonight biology failed me.
你们听听这个  来宾进场时我要唱这首  好012---Check it out. Okay, I could play this while the guests are coming in, okay.
第一次见到钱德时   我以为他是同性恋012---First time I met Chandler I thought he was gay
但我现在  却在他的婚礼上唱歌012---But here I am singing On his wedding day
菲比  不要012---Phoebe, no.
如果让我唱完  后面会说他大概不是同性恋012---If you'd let me finish, it goes on to say that he's probably not gay.
当然  你们没有这个问题  你们是木头做的012---You guys don't have this problem, you're made of wood.
嘿  嘿   你看来很不错012---Hey, you look great. Hey.
谢谢012---Oh, thanks.
你还好吗012---You okay over there?
我也不知道  觉得有一点012---I don't know. You know? I feel a little...
你知道吗   没关系   我会没事的012---You know what? Never mind. I'll be fine.
别担心  你大概只是累了  喝了太多香槟012---Don't worry about it. You're probably tired, you had a lot of champagne.
每个人都会的012---It happens to everybody.
嘿   嗨012---Hey. Wow. Hi.
哇   摩妮卡之夜快乐   谢谢   你也样012---Happy Monica's Night. Well, thank you. You too.
你能相信吗   他们真的要结婚了012---Can you believe they are actually getting married?
是啊  我常常结婚012---Well, sure, but I get married all the time.
你还好吗  我想是吧012---You okay? Yeah, I guess.
你觉得我们会不会有那么一天012---I mean, do-do you think we'll ever have that?
你说 "我们"  是指你和我012---You mean "we," you and me?
不   不   不012---Oh, no, no, no.
"我们" 是指你和别人  我和别人012---"We," you with someone, me with someone.
还好  吓了我一跳012---Good, you scared me a minute.
是啊   好可怕012---I know. Shake it off.
因为我们俩在一起是噩梦012---It's just because you and I, we were like a nightmare.
可是  也有好时光  当然   就像那次012---No, but there were some good times. No, absolutely. Y'know like there was...
你总想得起一点好的吧   给我一分钟012---Surely you can think of something good. Just give me a minute.
对了012---Oh, well, yes.
我想得出一件好事  是什么012---I can think of one good thing. What?
你总是很012---You were always good at the...
在行012---...at the, uh, the stuff.
是啊012---Yeah, I...
我很在行012---I was good at the stuff huh?
对  我真的很喜欢你的手012---Uh-hmm, yeah, yeah,I really liked your hands.
我的手  对012---My hands? Yeah.
是吗012---Yeah? Uh-huh.
做得好  兄弟012---Way to go, guys.
你也有很多事很在行012---You were really good at the stuff too.
我知道012---Oh, I know.
嘿   你知道我们从没做过什么吗012---Hey, you know what we never did?
不  不是那个啦012---Oh, no, not that.
我们从没有过 "红利"夜012---We never had bonus night.
什么  "红利"夜012---A what? You know, bonus night.
就是两个人分手了  然后见面度过最后一夜012---Y'know, when two people break up, but they get back together for one night.
最后一夜   只是上床   没有其他的012---One night, just sex? No strings attached?
对   我们从来没有过012---Yeah, yeah, we never had that.
没有过012---No. No.
好  这有一点怪怪的感觉012---Okay, this is getting a little crazy.
我是说012---Um, I mean...
我相信那个一定会很棒的012---...I'm sure it would be amazing...
但我想   这不是个好主意012---but I...gotta say I really-really don't think it would be a good idea.
我真的012---Y'know? I really ...
真的012---...really...
不012---...don't.
怎么样012---‘Sup? 
怎么样   老兄012---Sup dude? 
要什么随便拿   不要伤害我012---Take whatever you want, just please don't hurt me.
你玩电动游戏吧   嗯012---You playing a little PlayStation, huh?
够酷012---That's wack.
打电动游戏够酷啊012---PlayStation is wack.
打电动游戏怎么样   如何啊012---‘Sup with the wack PlayStation,‘sup?!
嗯012---Huh?
怎么样   像不像19岁012---Come on, am I 19 or what?
对  从1到10来评分   10分是一个人看来最笨的样子012---Yes, on a scale of one to 10, 10 being the dumbest a person can look...
你绝对是19012---...you are definitely 19.
真的  多大012---Come on, really. How old?
很年轻   你是男人孩子   好吗012---Young. You're a man-child, okay?
去换衣服  大家都准备好了  拜托  内裤别还我012---Now get changed, because everybody's ready. And please, please, keep my underwear.
谢谢012---Oh, thanks. Okay.
乔   干嘛012---Joe. Yeah.
你和人上床很多次   对不对012---You've had a lot of sex, right?
何时  今天012---When, today?
有几次   但不多012---Some, not a lot.
我问你是因为我有一点012---Well, it's just the reason I'm asking is because I had kind of a, uh--
我不能012---I was unable to--
我很想  可是不能012---I mean I really wanted too, but I couldn't...
是这样012---There, ha, hm.
我发生了一个意外012---There was an incident.
不要担心   有时是会这样的012---Don't worry about that, man. That happens.
你也发生过   对啊   有一次012---It's happened to you? Yeah, once.
那你怎么办   照样做啊012---Well, what'd you do? I did it anyway.
菲比   快点   我们走吧012---Phoebe, come on, let's go.
快点012---Come on.
你为什么还没换衣服啊012---Why aren't you dressed yet?
抱歉  我替你的婚礼写出了最佳曲子012---I'm sorry, but I just wrote the best song for your wedding.
要不听听看  不  菲比012---Check this out. No. Phoeb.
如果你现在换好衣服  你就可以在婚礼演出012---I'll tell you what, If you get ready now, I'll let you play.
真的   对012---Really?! Yes.
太令人兴奋了  谢谢你  摩妮卡012---Oh that's so exciting! Thank you! Thanks, Mon.
可是如果你再动我的吉他  我就会打你012---Oh but Mon, if you touch my guitar again, I'll have to pound on you a little bit.
好吧  准备出门  我去叫大家012---Fair enough. now go get ready. Okay. I'll get everybody.
终于可以开始庆祝我的012---Finally we can start celebrating my--
对不起  显然   我打开了通往过去的门012---I'm sorry, apparently I opened the door to the past.
好   摩妮卡   你刚刚看到的是012---Okay, Monica, Mon. Okay, what you just saw--
可以问你一个小小问题吗   为什么要在今晚012---Can I ask you just a little question? Why tonight?
什么   我等了一辈子想着订婚012---What? See, I've been waiting my whole life to be engaged.
不像某些人  我只计划做一次012---And unlike some, I only plan on doing this once.
可能这个很自私  我很抱歉  但我希望这是今晚的焦点012---So, uh y'know, maybe it's selfish, I'm sorry about it, but I was kinda hoping tonight could just be about that.
甜心  这是今晚的焦点啊  不  这不是012---Oh, honey, but it is just about.. No, it's not.
不  不  不  现在焦点是你们的复合   什么012---No it’s not! No! No! Now it's about you and Ross getting back together. What?!
你看  你们抢了我的风头012---See yeah umm, you kind of stole my thunder.
好   等等   我们没有抢你的风头  我们并没有想要复合012---Okay! Ho-ho! We did not steal your thunder because we are not getting back together.
是啊  反正也没有人看到  没错012---Yeah, no, and nobody even saw. Yeah.
真的012---That's true.
我们只是吻了一下   只是一个吻012---Honey I swear it we just kissed. It was just a kiss.
你们吻了012---You guys kissed?
那是什么意思啊012---What does this mean?
你们复合了吗  我可以在你们婚礼上演唱吗012---Are you, are you back together? Can I sing at your wedding?
风头被抢了012---Thunder being stolen.
菲比  没有什么  莫尼卡  不要小事化大012---Okay come on Phoebe, it's nothing. Monica, come on! Let's not make a big deal out of this!
只发生一次   根本不算什么012---It was a one-time thing. It doesn't even matter.
我的天012---Oh, my God.
你们竟然在谈论这件事012---I cannot believe you guys are talking about this.
卧室里的问题是他们两个人之间的事012---Problems in the bedroom are between a man and woman.
好吗   钱德已经尽力了012---All right? Now, Chandler is doing the best he can.
我想他们不是在讨论这事  乔012---I don't think that's what they were talking about. Joe!!
真是个良夜啊   钱德不行了  他们却亲吻了012---What a great night. Chandler can't do it, they kissed.
什么   你们亲吻了  太大条了012---What? You guys kissed? This is huge.
不  这不算大条012---No-no, it's really not huge.
大家觉得这事大条不   让摩妮卡觉得012---People thinking it's huge has led Monica to believe...
我们抢了她的风头   但是我们没有012---...we're stealing her thunder, which we aren't.
可我们还在谈论这件事   不是吗012---We're still talking about it. aren't we?
那件事  还有钱德的问题012---That, and Chandler's problem.
摩妮卡  听着啊012---Monica, listen, listen.
如果我们不再谈罗斯和瑞秋   你会不会觉得好一点012---Would you feel better if we stopped talking about Ross and Rachel?
会很好  没问题012---That would be lovely. You got it.
来   我看起来可以像19岁吧012---Now, I can pass for 19, right?
对   你可以看起来像19岁012---Yes, you can pass for 19.
真的  对啊012---Really? Yes.
认真的   认真的012---Seriously? Seriously?
认真的说  不  你可以扮演你现在的年纪  也就是31岁012---Seriously, no. Okay? You can play your own age, which is 31.
我30岁012---I'm 30!
乔伊   不是   你31岁了012---Joey, you are not. You're 31.
真烂012---Oh, crap!
好  去广场饭店  叫些迈泰  不过你可能不能再喝了012---So, the Plaza. We'll get some mai tais? Maybe no more for you though.
我不想去广场饭店了012---You know, I-I think that umm, I don't feel like going to the Plaza.
为什么   摩妮卡  这太可笑了012---Why? Honey, Monica, this is ridiculous.
我不想谈这件事了   不想   尤其是和你012---I don't want to talk about it. I don't. Especially with you.
够酷012---Pssh. That is wack.
是吗012---Yeah?
好   我会在婚礼上唱这首歌012---Okay, I think I'll play it at the wedding.
好  不过要看他们  是不是真的让你演唱012---Yeah, well, we'll see if they actually let you play, huh?
他们会说你想听的话  像是  012---I mean they tell you anything you want to hear, like...
"你看起来像19岁"012--- "You look 19."
然后又反悔说  "不  你不像"012---Then they just take it away, like, "No, you don't."
这件事摩妮卡不会反悔的012---Well, I don't think Monica won't take this away.
她不会吗   难道她会吗012---Wouldn't she? Would she?
她会吗012---Would she?
你吃了我的糖果012---You ate my candy bar!
猜猜是谁012---Guess who.
嘿012---Hey.
我刚发现  我们似乎还有些事没解决012---Hey, I just realized we kind of left some stuff up in the air.
你认为摩妮卡说012---What do you think Monica mean when she said
"我不想谈" 特别是和我   是什么意思012---"I don't want to talk," especially with me?
为什么不特别是你和我   是我们两人在接吻012---I mean, Why not especially you and me? We were both out there kissing.
你还在想那件事吗012---Still thinking about it?
我是认真的  她说 "尤其是你" 什么意思012---I'm serious. What did she mean by that? "Especially you."
谁在乎啊  我在乎012---Oh, who cares? I care.
我也在乎012---And so do I.
我要和她谈谈   让我换件衣服好吗012---Y'know what, I have to talk to her. Will you let me just get changed?
好啊   没问题012---Okay, sure.
我要让你看我换衣服吗012---Am I going to let you watch me undress?
不012---No.
我不相信她竟然如此   她就是这样012---I can't believe her. It's just so typical.
摩妮卡  我知道你不高兴  可别忘了要举行婚礼了012---Now Monica, I know you're upset, but don't forget there is going to be a wedding.
你会去丢花   然后去蜜月012---You are going to throw the bouquet, and then a honeymoon.
可能去巴黎   巴黎012---Maybe in Paris. Paris?
我们会在月光下的   那叫什么来着的大道上散步012---We will take a moonlit walk on the Rue de la blah-blah-blah.
继续说012---Keep talking.
我们会在床上洒些玫瑰花瓣   然后做爱012---Then we will sprinkle rose petals on the bed and make love...
不是因为那样很浪漫   而是因为我能做到012---...not just because it's romantic, but because I can.
我爱你012---I love you.
别说话   你会把它吓跑的012---Okay, don't say anything, you might scare it away.
这是巴黎   谁知道我们在这里012---It's Paris. Who knows we're here?
菲比  什么事012---Hi, Pheebs. What's up?
你说我可以在你的婚礼上演唱   所以我要收订金012---You said I could sing at your wedding, so I need a small deposit.
什么  你知道  需要用一笔钱来预定那个日期012---What? Y'know, just some good faith money to hold the date.
我们不会给你订金012---We're not giving you a deposit for our wedding.
喔  我懂了012---Oh, I see.
他们真能伤你的心  不是吗012---They break your heart, don't they?
我不需要他们的同意012---You know, I don't really need their permission.
你想在他们婚礼上唱歌  就在他们婚礼上唱歌012---Yeah! if you wanna sing at their wedding, well you sing at their wedding.
如果你想看起来像19岁  就要012---Yeah, and if you want to look 19, then you--
你要修饰一下你的眼睛012---You got to do something about your eyes.
怎么   我的眼睛怎么了012---What?! What's wrong with my eyes?
他们出卖了你   出卖了里面太多的智慧012---They give you away. There's just-there's just too much wisdom in there.
在上面放茶袋敷15分钟012---Just put some tea bags on them for 15 minutes.
这个也会去除我的智慧  也许你只需要10分钟012---That'll get rid of my wisdom? Maybe 10 minutes for you.
给她订金  给她戒指   我不在乎012---Oh, give her the deposit, give her the ring. I don't care.
什么事   摩妮卡  你是什么意思  你说012---Yes? Monica, What did you mean when you said...
你不想和任何人谈  尤其是我012---...you didn't want to talk to anyone, especially me?
好棒的道歉  你接受了  再见012---What a great apology. And you accept it. Bye-bye.
不  我是认真的 "特别是和我"  是怎么回事012---No-no, seriously-seriously, what was the "especially me" part about?
这样说吧   这不是你第一次抢了我的风头012---Well, let's just say it's not the first time you've stolen my thunder.
什么012---Wham'?
我觉得012---Hey, here's a thought...
摩妮卡  你在说什么啊012---Monica, what are you talking about?
我16岁的生日宴会上  记得你和我表哥查理上三垒012---My sweet 16. Remember, you went to third base with my cousin Charlie.
啊  上三垒012---Ah, third base.
每个人都在讲那件事012---It was all everybody at the party could talk about.
摩妮卡  那会儿发生是因为你的宴会太无聊了012---Monica, y'know what? The only reason I did that was because your party was so boring.
我们请了一个漫画家012---We had a caricaturist. Oh.
当我结婚时  猜猜不会请谁来演唱012---Whenever I get married Guess who won't be asked to sing
叫盖勒的还有叫宾的012---Somebody named Geller And somebody else named Bing
摩妮卡  你的甜蜜16岁生日就像是一百万年前的事了012---Monica, your sweet 16 was like a million years ago.
而你现在又再做了一次012---And yet, here we are doing it again.
我不想抢你的所谓的风头012---Ugh, Monica I don't want to steal your stupid thunder.
那还有什么原因   你会和罗斯亲热012---Why else would you have made out with Ross?
我不知道012---Got me.
够了啦   时机已过  不会发生了012---All right, easy mimey, the moment has passed. It ain't gonna happen.
如果今晚的注意力都在我身上就好了012---I just thought it would be nice if I could have this one night.
我发誓  我从没有想要过抢你的风头012---I swear, I never wanted any part of your night.
不应该有人看到我们接吻的012---No one was supposed to see us kissing.
所以你们就在秘密走廊上做吧  因为没有人会到那儿去012---Oh, is that why you did it the secret hallway where nobody ever goes?!
瑞秋  我想过了012---Uh, Rachel, I've been thinking.
我觉得我们今晚在一起的主意不是很好012---I don't think us getting together tonight is such a good idea.
我想退出了012---I'm calling it off.

不敢相信  你们竟然在我的订婚之夜做爱012---I can't believe you're gonna have sex on my engagement night.
总得有人做啊012---Well, somebody should.
如果我们要做012---Look, if we're gonna do this--

好  为什么   因为我很伤心012---Okay, why? Because! Because I was sad.
什么意思012---What do you mean?

很为你们高兴012---...so happy for you guys.
但你要结婚这件事   提醒了我   我没有012---But you getting married just reminds me of the fact that I'm not.
八字都没一撇012---I'm not even close.
也许我只想让自己好过一点012---And I don't know, maybe I just wanted to make myself feel better.
我知道这很笨  可是罗斯结婚时012---I know that that's dumb, but you were so depressed...
