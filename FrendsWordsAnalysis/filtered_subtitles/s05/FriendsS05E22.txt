我不需要听这种话  搞不懂你干嘛泄我的气012---Y'know what? I don't need this! Okay? I don't know why you're dumping all over my big break.
乔伊  我不认为你这次能翻身012---Because, Joe, I don't think this is going to be your big break.
所以你才来这趟   让我觉得自己是窝囊废012---Is that why you're on this trip? Huh? To make me feel like a loser?

不知道  他突然发疯  我们在玩快问快答的游戏012---I don't know. He went crazy. Y'know, We were playing that game where you ask a question and you answer it really fast.
没有我在场监督  绝对不能玩那个游戏012---Oh, that game should not be played without my supervision.
我不知道他干嘛气成那样012---Well, I don't know what made him mad.
我只是说他这次不会翻身012---All I said was that, uh, I didn't think this was gonna be his big break...
说这部电影帮不了他012---...that this movie wasn't gonna do anything for him...
说这部电影很像是幌子012---...and that uh, y'know it didn't sound like a real movie.
好啦  他该把我推下桥才对012---Okay, he should've pushed me off the bridge.
你袋子里有什么012---What's in the bag?
我猜想你们大家也会对我不爽012---Oh, I figured you guys would all be mad at me...

可恶  滴完了012---Damn, it's empty.
如果现在乔伊和钱德走进来  我们就发了012---Wow. y'know if Joey and Chandler walked in right now, we could make a fortune.
一定是钱德  乔伊或罗斯012---Ooh, that is definitely Chandler, Joey or Ross.
或是瑞秋012---Or Rachel.
喂012---Hello?
是乔伊012---It's Joey.
真高兴你打来  钱德都说了  他很难过012---I'm so glad you called. Chandler told me what happened. He's really upset.
等他知道他毛衣的下场  他一定会更难过012---Not as upset as he's gonna be when he finds out what I did with his sweater vests.
你把他的毛衣怎么了012---What did you do to his sweater vests?
这么说吧  在俄玄俄州  有一伙打扮亮丽的狗012---Let's just say there's a well-dressed pack of dogs in Ohio.

乔伊  钱德在这儿  不知道你012---Joey, Chandler's here. He was wondering if...
我想他零钱正好用完了012---Okay, I guess he ran out of change.
他连话都不想跟我说  这样我要怎么跟他道歉012---Y'know, He won't even talk to me. How am I gonna apologize to him if he won't even talk to me?
或许你应该寄点东西给他012---Maybe you should send him something.
等他到了赌城  就知道你想表达歉意了012---So when he gets to Las Vegas, he'll know that you're sorry.
好主意  上哪儿找一堆成人A片呢012---That's a good idea. I wonder where I could get a basket of porn?
不行  不能用成人片道歉啦  真的012---Oh, no,  don't-don't say I'm sorry with porn! Really?

你为何生我的气  因为你说我很无趣012---Why are you mad at me? You said I was boring. Oh.
我何时说过你无趣了012---When did I say you were boring?
天啊  我想起来了  我们下西洋棋那次012---Oh, my God, I remember now. We were playing chess.
菲比  我和你没下过西洋棋012---Phoebe, you and I have never played chess.
有啦  记得冰冻湖那次吗  我们玩西洋棋  你说我很无趣012---Oh, come on! Yes, remember that time on the frozen lake? We were playing chess, you said I was boring,
然后你脱下面具  变成了卡麦蓉狄亚012---and then you took off your energy mask and you were Cameron Diaz!.

资金会出现的  大家都爱投资拍片012---The money'll turn up. People always wanna invest in movies.
你该不会是有钱人吧  我不是012---Hey, you're not rich, are you? No.
问一下也无妨012---Worth a shot.
