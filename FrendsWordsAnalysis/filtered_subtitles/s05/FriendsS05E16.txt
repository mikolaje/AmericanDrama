我可以说个更好笑的012---I think I can come up with something better than that.
菲比   一定有人正在找那个警徽012---Phoebe, I bet somebody's missing that badge.

我还是不确定012---Yeah, I still don't know.
抱歉  我想买到理想的沙发  我希望这张沙发能让人觉得012---I'm sorry I just wanna make sure that I bought the right couch. I need a couch that says:
"小朋友  欢迎"  同时也能让人觉得012---"Kids welcome here," but that also says
"来我身边吧"012---"Come here to me."
什么  你对小朋友说那种话012---What? You say that to kids?
不  不  不是012---No, no, no.
"来我身边吧"  是对小姐们说的012---The "Come here to me" is, you know, for the ladies.
罗斯  这是张好沙发  但不是神奇沙发012---Ross, honey, it's a nice couch, not a magic couch.

对  瑞秋012---Yeah. Rash'?
我现在不想说这个  我抬着一张很重的沙发012---Come on, I don't really want to be doing this right now. I am carrying a very heavy couch.
那你就赶快告诉他啊012---Then tell him quickly.
好  我们交往过012---Fine. We went out.
不只交往过012---Not only did we go out...
我们还做过298次012---...we did it 298 times!
罗斯012---Ross.
我实在012---Oh, WV"

你在跟谁说话  别挣扎了  红发女012---Who are you talking to? Save it, red!
不想在笼子里过夜  就跟那颗树道歉012---Unless you want to spend the night in the slammer, you apologize to the tree.
我才不跟一颗树道歉呢012---I am not going to apologize to a tree.
赶快道歉  否则我要叫人了012---You apologize to the tree right now, or I am calling for backup.
来人啊  来人啊012---Backup! Backup!
对不起  对不起012---I'm sorry! Sorry!
好  别来了  别来了012---Okay, cancel backup! Cancel backup!

我是有说  但其实没有  来吧012---Uhh, yes I did but there isn't. Okay, here we go.

没问题吧  没问题吧  没问..012---You got it, right? You got it, right? You got--
你觉得放在那里好看吗012---Any chance you think the couch looks good there?
这家伙还在碎碎念012---...so this guy was all...
我就说  "重案组  布非"012---And I'm all, "Buffay! Homicide!"
真是太帅了012---It was just so cool! Ha-ha-ha.
菲比  你应该拿去还的012---Phoebe, you were supposed to take that back.
我知道  但行善的感觉好棒012---I know, but I'm having so much fun doing good deeds.
但假扮警察很严重  你会被逮捕的012---Okay, but impersonating a police officer is a serious thing. You can get arrested.
你现在就会被逮捕012---You could get arrested right now!
好吧  我得拿去还了  我被权力冲昏头了012---All right, yeah, I'd better take it back. I'm totally drunk with power.
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
嗨  乔伊012---Hi, Joe.
我不知道你们会在012---Yeah. I didn't know you guys were gonna be here.
乔伊  你尝尝看  什么  为什么012---Hey Joey, do me a favor, sweetie. Taste this. What? Why?
你是怎么了  没事啊012---What is going on with you? Nothing.
拜托  你一整天都怪怪的012---Oh, come on! You've been acting strange all day.
好吧  是有一件事  我012---All right. There is something. I, uh...
我做了一个梦012---I kind of had a dream.
但我不想谈012---But I don't want to talk about it.
马丁路德金恩也这么说  还得了012---Oh, whoa. What if Martin Luther King had said that?
我有一个梦012---I kind of have a dream.
但是我不想谈012---I don't want to talk about it.
跟摩妮卡有关012---Look, it involved Monica.
你梦到我正在交往的女孩  真是酷啊012---You had a dream about a girl I'm seeing? Oh, that is so cool.
我不知梦见他的女朋友多少次012---I can't tell you how many times I dreamt about a girl he was seeing.
总之  我们在谈你的梦  我爱你  你的梦012---Anyway, we were talking about your dream. I love you. Your dream?
放心  没有任何性意味  自从发现你们的事012---Don't worry, there wasn't any sex in it. I haven't dreamt about her like that...
我就不对她做那种梦了012---...since I found out about you two-ish.
那你梦到什么012---What was the dream about?
好吧012---Well, okay.
你是我的女朋友  我们在填字谜012---You were my girlfriend. We were doing the crossword puzzle.
就像你们昨晚那样012---Y'know like you guys were doing last night.
就这样  我爱上摩妮卡了 我会搬走012---So that's it. I'm in love with Monica and I'll be moving out.
乔伊  等等  那并不代表你爱我012---Wait, Joey, come on. That doesn't mean that you're in love with me.
不是吗012---It doesn't?
它可能有很多涵义  例如012---It could mean anything. Like, uh...
你突然眼红我成为这里的猛男012---...all of a sudden you're jealous that I've become the apartment stud.
这个  听起来比较像你的梦012---That kinda sounds like your dream, dude.
或是你看到我和钱德在一起  很亲密012---Or it could mean you saw Chandler and me together, and we y'know were being close and stuff...
你也想跟别人拥有这种亲密关系012---...and then you just want to have that with someone too.
我在梦里的确很享受那种亲密012---In the dream I did enjoy the closeness.
好  听着012---Okay, look.
你爱上摩妮卡了吗012---Are you attracted to Monica?
就是现在  此时此刻  爱上她了吗012---Right here, right now, are you attracted to her?
其实没有  这就对了012---Not really. There you have it!
当然啊  我穿得这么随便012---Heh. Well, sure! I'm just wearing sweats!
但那是好事012---But that's good!
你不是爱我  你只是想交个女朋友012---You're not in love with me. because you just want a girlfriend!
不  我觉得不是交女朋友的问题012---No, I don't think it's just about getting a girlfriend.
对  我可以找个女朋友012---Yeah, Y'know? I mean, I could get a girlfriend.
对  我们可以坐在那里填字谜012---Yeah, we could sit in the chair and do crossword puzzles.
但我们会拥有你们那种亲密感觉吗012---But y'know are we ever gonna have y'know the closeness like you guys have?
摩妮卡和我是从朋友做起的  也许关键在这里012---Monica and I were friends before we started dating. Maybe that's it.
先做朋友012---Friends first?
有意思012---That's interesting.
你们都事后当朋友  没有  也从来没有过012---You become friends after? No, never done that either.
嘿  你们有量尺吗012---Um, do you guys have a tape measure?
有  在我房里012---Oh, yeah. It's actually in my bedroom.
没错012---That's right.
乔伊  怎么了012---What's up, Joey?
你好吗012---How you doing?
抱歉  这是你的车吗  对012---Excuse me. Is this your car? Yeah.
停在这里不太好  你挡住出入口了012---Well, I don't think it's nice of you to park here. You're blocking the entrance.
放心  没关系的012---Don't worry about it. It's not a problem.
我觉得有关系  你就有关系  因为我是条子012---It's a problem for me, which means it's a problem for you because I'm a cop.
我也是012---So am I.
完了012---Oh, no.
好  你是条子  可以任意停车012---Oh, okay. so you're a cop which means you can park anywhere,
因为我也是条子012---'cause I know that 'cause I'm a cop too. 
好  继续努力  收到012---So, all right, keep up the good work. Ten-four.
等一下  你是哪个分局的012---Hey, wait a second! So wait, what precinct are you with?
我在57分局012---I'm with the, um, the 57th.
我认识你们重案组一位刑警  我在风化组012---I know a guy in Homicide up there. I'm in Vice.
事实上  我正在卧底  我是妓女012---Yeah, In fact, I'm undercover right now. I'm a whore.
风化组还有谁012---Who else is in Vice up there?
你认识012---Um, do you know, um...
西波威兹吗012---...Sipowitz?
西波威兹  不  应该不认识012---Sipowitz? No, I don't think so.
对  西波威兹  大块头  有点秃012---Yeah. Sipowitz. Yeah. Big guy, kind of bald.
我不认识他012---I don't know him.
不要打给他  他不在  他出去了012---Don't try to call him or anything. Because he's not there. He's out.
他的拍档  刚死了012---His, um, partnerjust died.
帮我跟西波威兹致意012---Tell Sipowitz I'm real sorry for his loss.
我会的  保重012---I sure will. Take care.
对了  我相信西波威兹不会有事的012---Hey, by the way, I'm sure Sipowitz is gonna be all right.
听说那个新来的小伙子很不错012---I heard that kid from Silver Spoons is really good.
你在哪里找到我的警徽的012---And where did you find my badge?
嘿  乔伊  你能不能帮我和罗斯搬沙发012---Hey, Joey, would you mind giving me and Ross a hand moving his couch?
我很想  但我要去上表演课  但你知道012---Aw, I'd love to but I got acting class. But you know what?
我可以为了你跷课的012---I guess I could blow that off for you.
谢谢012---Thanks.
瑞秋  我问你件事  我刚在对面跟摩妮卡和钱德聊天012---Uh, hey, Rach let me ask you something.Uh, I was just over there talking to Monica and Chandler, 
他们可真亲密012---Boy, they are really tight.
是啊012---I know.
那种关系实在很不错012---Yeah that's not such a bad situation they got going over there. 
我也想自己弄一段012---I'm thinking of getting me one of those.
你想说什么  乔伊012---What's up, Joe?
我觉得他们感觉会那么好012---The reason I think Monica and Chandler are so great...
是因为他们是先做朋友012---...is because they were friends first, you know?
于是我问自己  谁是我朋友  你和菲比012---So I asked myself, who are my friends? You and Phoebe.
而我先遇见你  所以012---I saw you first, so...
你在说什么  我是说也许你我可以更进一步012---What are you saying? I'm saying maybe you and I crank it up a notch.
乔伊012---You know, honey, um...
你先过见我012---..as, uh, flattered as I am...
真令我受宠若惊012---...that you saw me first...
但我不觉得我们应该更进一步012---...uhh, I just, I-I don't think we should be cranking anything up.
我会对你很好012---I'll treat you real nice.
对  你知道吗012---Yeah. Well, you know, um...
我觉得先做朋友再交往  是一个很好的想法012---Listen, I think it's a great idea to become friends with someone before you date.
但你应该先去认识一个人  跟她做朋友012---But I think the way you do it is you meet someone, become their friend...
建立基础  再约她出去012---...build a foundation, then ask them out on a date.
别对现有的朋友下手012---Don't hit on your existing friends.
那不是要等很久了012---Won't that take longer?
没错  没错012---Yeah. Yeah.
但是一旦得到了012---Oh, but once you find it...
真的很值得012---...it's so worth the wait.
这样012---Yeah.
我懂  我懂012---I understand. I understand.
很好012---Good.
天啊  如果先遇见菲比就好了012---Man, I wish I saw Phoebe first.
来我身边吧012---Come here to me.
不  不  你来我身边012---No, no. You come here to me.
嘿  罗斯012---Hey, Ross.
我带援军来了  太好了  是乔伊吗012---Ahem, I brought reinforcements. Oh, great! You brought Joey?
只比他差点012--- Well, I brought the next best thing. Heh.
嘿012---Hey-
钱德  你带钱德来  只差一点的应该是摩妮卡012---Chandler?!  You brought Chandler? The next best thing would be Monica!
我应该感觉不爽了  但摩妮卡真的壮得可怕012---Y'know, I would be offended, but Monica is freakishly strong...
看  我画了一张搬运草图012---Look, I drew a sketch of how we'll do it.
好  瑞秋  这是你012---Okay ,Rach, that's you.
这是沙发012---That's the couch.
那是什么012---Oh, what's that?
那是我012---Oh, that's me.
你把自己看得很雄壮喔012--- You certainly think a lot of yourself.
不  那是我的手臂012---No. That's my arm.
喔  我还以为你那么喜欢你的新沙发012---Oh, I see. I thought you just really, really liked your new couch.
总之听我的指示012---Just follow my lead.
好012---0key.
钱德  来吧012---Come on, Chandler.
好  开始了012---All right. Okay.

可以了吗  可以012---All right. Ready?
转  好012---Turn! Okay.
转012---Turn!
转012---Turn!
应该是转不动了  我觉得挤不上去012---I don't think we can turn anymore! I don't think it'll fit!
当然可以  快抬起来  抬起来  抬起来012---Yeah, it will. Come on! Up, up, up!
抬起来  很好012---UP! Yes!
很好  中心点012---Here we go! Pivot!
中心点012---Pivot!
中心点012---Pivot!
中心点012---Pivot!
中心点012---Pivot!
中心点012---Pivot!
闭嘴  闭嘴  闭嘴012---Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!
好  我看是上不来了012---I don't think it's gonna pivot anymore.
是吗012---You think?
好吧  搬下去再来一次012---All right, let's, uh, bring it back down and try again.
现在真的卡死了012---I think it's really stuck now.
想不到居然没成功  就是啊  我也没想到012---I can't believe that didn't work. I know. Me neither.
你都画了图了012---I mean, you had a sketch.
你说那个 "中心点"是什么意思012---What did you mean when you said "pivot"?
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
怎么样  有交到新朋友吗012---How's it going? Did you make any new friends?
有  我认识了一个女人012---Yeah. I met this woman.
嘿  哇  哇012---Hey. Whoa, whoa.
她怎么样012---What's she like?
她的012---Uh, well, she's...
床上功夫很棒012---...really good in bed.
乔伊  你不是要先当朋友嘛012---Joey, I thought you were going to try to be friends first.
都是你的错  什么  为什么啊012---Well look, hey, it's all your fault. What? Why?
因为你给的不是忠告  是搭讪词012---Well because you didn't give me advice. No! You gave me a pickup line.
我一说要 "建立基础  先当朋友"012---As soon as I told her I wanted to y'know, "build a foundation and be friends first."
她突然就...与我本身无关  觉得我难以抗拒012---I suddenly, through no fault of my own, I became irresistible to her!
她的室友也是012---And her roommate!
那亲密关系呢012---What about the "closeness"?
谁还管亲密啊  我们玩三P啊012---Closeness, schmosness! There was three of us, for crying out loud!
谁要吃彼萨012---All right! Hey, Who wants pizza?
我要  我要  我要012---I do! I do! I do!
