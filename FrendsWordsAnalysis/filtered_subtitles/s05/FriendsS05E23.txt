喂012---Hello?
喂  乔伊  菲比  帮我个忙好吗012---Hey, Joey! Hey, Pheebs. Listen, uh Can you do me a favor?
我忘记提款卡的密码  你可以帮我去找吗012---I forgot the PIN to my ATM card. Can you get it for me?
好啊  在哪里  我刻在提款机的角落那里012---Sure. Where is it? Uh, I scratched it on the ATM machine on the corner.
原来5639是你的密码012---Oh, so you're 5-6-3-9?
没错  菲比  谢了012---That's it! Thanks Pheebs!
你要跟钱德说话吗012---Do you wanna talk to Chandler?
是乔伊吗  让我跟他说012---Is that Joey? Let me talk to him.
不要  他不相信我的电影012---No. He didn't believe in my movie...
他大错特错  这次的电影是真的012---...which is a big mistake, because it is real. Real.
我这星期都试着跟他道歉  若他不让我在电话上说012---Y'know what? I've tried to apologize in all week. If I can't do it on the phone,
我就直接杀过去当面说012---I'll go down there and do it in person.
菲比  我听到了  请他听电话012---Uhh Pheebs, I heard that. Uh, can you put him on?
好012---Yeah.
嘿  你别过来012---Hey. Don't come out here.
不行  我百分之百支持你  我要当面证明给你看012---No-no-no-no, I support you 100 percent and I wanna prove that to you in person.
收到  我原谅你  你别过来012---I got that. I forgive you. Don't come out here.
原谅我  你一星期都不接我电话012---Forgive me? You haven't taken my calls for a week.
钱德  我早都不介意了  咱们是一辈子的朋友012---Well, I'm totally over it Chandler. Friends forever.
你别过来012---Don't come out here.
可以跟我们照张相吗012---Would you mind doing a picture with us?
那是什么012---Uh, what was that?
《今夜娱乐》节目012---Uh, Entertainment Tonight.
好了  很高兴跟你说话  你别过来012---Yeah, okay so, good talking to you and don't come out here. All right.
老友记  第五季  第23集  拉斯维加斯之旅（上集）012---Friends  S05E23  The One In Vegas
摩妮卡  抱歉我迟到了012---Monica? I'm sorry I'm late.
摩妮卡012---Monica?
菲比012---Phoebe?
真对不起012---I'm so sorry.
你到很久了吗   没关系啦012---Have you been here long? That's okay.
你怎么拖了那么久012---What the hell took you so long?
好  不许你跟钱德说012---Okay, you can't tell Chandler.
我遇见了理查012---That I ran into Richard.
哪个理查  那个理查012---Which Richard? The Richard.
理查西蒙斯  天啊012---Richard Simmons? Oh, my God!
不是啦  是我前男友理查012---No, my ex-boyfriend Richard.
个子高高  有胡子那个012---You know, the tall guy, mustache.
好吧  这就说得过去了012---Okay, that actually makes more sense.
情况如何012---How was it?
好极了  我们先是闲聊012---It was, it was really nice. We started talking 
后来一起吃了个午饭012---and I-I ended up having lunch with him.
怪了  我有梦到你跟理查吃饭012---That is so weird! I had a dream that you'd have lunch with Richard.
真的  不过是跟理查西蒙斯啦012---Really? But again, Simmons.
你继续说  奇怪的是虽然他很棒012---Go on. The strange part was he was really nice...
也很帅  但是我对他完全没感觉了012---and he looks great, but I didn't feel anything at all!
那为什么不能跟钱德说012--- Ooh! So now why can't we tell Chandler?
因为他听了一定会发神经012---Because it would totally freak him out
明天就是我们的纪念日  我不想搞砸012---and tomorrow's our anniversary. I don't wanna spoil that.
不敢相信你们交往一年了012---Oh, I can't believe you guys lasted a whole year!
哇  我欠瑞秋20美元012---Wow, I owe Rachel 20 bucks.
什么  那是完全不相干的赌局啦012---What? On a totally different bet.
嘿012---Hey!
一周年纪念日快到了012---It's almost our anniversary!
我知道012---I know.
你相信吗  一年前的今天  我还是只是烦人的朋友钱德012---Can you believe it? One year ago today, I was just your annoying friend Chandler.
现在你是我烦人的朋友钱德012---Aw, now you're just my annoying friend Chandler.
我帮你买了礼物   纪念日明天才到012---Huh.  I got you a present! Oh, but it's not 'til tomorrow!
我知道  但你今天就要开礼物  好吧012---I know, but you have to open it today. Okay.
我来啦012---Okay! There you go!
两张去赌城的机票012---It's two tickets to Vegas! Wow.
这周末的来回机票012---Yeah! For this weekend!
一定很完美  不但能去看乔伊  还能在飞机上开始过纪念日012---Oh gosh, it would be perfect, we get to see Joey plus we get to start our anniversary celebration on the plane.
就叫做 "飞机纪念日"吧012---We can call it our "Plane-a-versary."
一定要这样叫012---We have to?
不用啦012---No.
这是很棒没错  但乔伊说了不要我们过去012---Okay this is great, but Joey said he didn't want any of us out there.
他只是怕麻烦我们而已012---Oh, he just doesn't want us to go through any trouble.
想想到时候我们突然出现  他一定超兴奋的012---Think of how excited he'll be when we go out and surprise him! 
而且我们自己还有 "赌城纪念日"012---Plus, we get to have our own "Anna-Vegas-ry"!
"内华达纪念日"012---"A-Nevadaversary!"
对  我们该开始和别人交往012---Yeah, I think we should see other people.
我们可以去吧   对012---We can go, right?
那就好  这是个好主意012---Yes. Okay! Great idea.
好啊  我也要去012---Okay, I'm gonna go too!
菲比  这是我俩的纪念日012---Y'know Pheebs, it's kind of our anniversary.
少来  休想再像上次伦敦那样把我甩掉012---Oh please, you are not gonna ditch again like you did with London.
菲比  哪有甩掉   当时你怀了三胞胎012---Ditch you?  Phoebe, you were pregnant with the triplets!
那我不管  我非去不可012---Uh-huh. Great story. I'm going.
嗨  嘿012---Hi. Hey.
注意  这周末大家一起去赌城  给乔伊一个惊喜012---Hey, you guys, Listen, this weekend we're all gonna go to Las Vegas to surprise Joey!
包括我012---Including me!
你们要去吗012---You wanna go?!
我应该可以请个几天假012---I can take a couple days off work.
你当然可以请几天假  因为这趟我也要去012---Of course you can take a couple days off, because this trip includes me!
等等  差点忘了  我明天要提报告  不能缺席012---Oh no, wait a minute, wait, I've got a presentation tomorrow. I can't miss that.
我也买了梵谷画展的票  我盼了一年才盼到012---I've got tickets to the Van Gogh exhibit. I've been waiting like a year for this.
瑞秋  不如你我周六再飞去012---So Rach，you and I could fly out together Saturday.
听起来很可行  好  那我打电话去订票012---Sounds great. Yeah? All right I'll call the airlines. Okay.
其实想起来也很不赖  我可以独自在公寓过一晚012---Yeah, Y'know，that would be nice actually, to have the apartment to myself for a night.
对  你可以脱光光到处走012---Oh yeah, so you can walk around naked.
不是  我可以自己一个人 享受独处的时光012---No, so I can be by myself. Y'know? Have a little alone time.
脱光光的独处时光012---Naked alone time.
菲比  我想一个人独处  并不表示我就想脱光光到处走012---No! Phoebe Just because I'm alone doesn't mean I wanna walk around naked.
你自己一个人住  你也不会脱光光到处走啊012---You live alone, you don't walk around naked.
你以为我为什么老半天才去开门012---Uh-huh. Why does it takes me so long to answer the door?
这趟旅程到现在为止  比起伦敦那趟好还是坏012---So far, is this trip to Las Vegas better or worse than the trip to London?
菲比  到现在为止都差不多012---So far, it's pretty much the same, Pheebs.
好  那我给你们糖果之后呢012---Okay, What about after I give you these candies?
对  我想好一点了012---Yeah, I guess it's a little better now. Ha, ha.
好  赌城1分  伦敦O分012---Ah-ha! Okay, Las Vegas, 1. London, 0.
我马上回来012---I'll be back.
飞机纪念日快乐012---Happy Plane-a-versary.
我爱你012---Aww! I love you!
礼物能趁现在给你吗   好啊012---Can I give you your present now? Okay!
要命  不会吧012---Oh man! don't tell me I did this.
我最爱你假装没带礼物了012---I love "I forgot the present" fake-out!
那如果 "我是真的没带礼物  请你多多包涵呢"012---How do you feel about the, "I really did forgot the present, please forgive me" not fake out?
没关系啦  别放在心上  等回去再给我就行了012---Oh that's okay. Don’t worry about it, you can give it to me when we get back.
纪念日发生这种事  真是再扫兴不过了012---Ohh that's the worse thing that can happen on an anniversary ever!
很好  你最后还是决定  要跟钱德说理查的事了012---Oh good! All right, so you decided to tell him about the Richard thing.
什么理查的事012---What-what Richard thing?
糟糕012---Oh, no.
什么理查的事   用西蒙斯混过去012---What "Richard thing"? Simmons. Go with Simmons.
好吧  我昨天遇到了理查012---Okay, I umm, I ran into Richard yesterday.
他问我要不要一起吃饭  我答应了012---and he asked me if I wanted to go for a bite and I did.
我没跟你说是因为012---The only reason I didn't tell you because.
我知道你会生气  而我不想毁了周年纪念日012---I knew you'd get mad and I didn't want to spoil our anniversary.
我不生气啊012---I'm not mad.
真的  是啊012---Really? Oh yeah! 
你遇到理查  一起吃饭012---Yeah,so you-you bumped into Richard! You grabbed a bite!
没啥大不了的012---No big deal.
太好了012---Great.
好  伦敦1分012---Okay, London, 1.
喔  怎么会这样012---Oh, look what happened.
瞧瞧我自己012---Huh, check me out.
我在自家的厨房012---I'm in my kitchen...
脱光光012---...naked.
拿起一颗柳丁012---I'm picking up an orange.
我脱光光012---I'm naked.
点起蜡烛012---lighting the candles.
脱光光  要小心012---naked, and carefully.
天啊  瑞秋真的脱光光了012---Oh, my God! That's Rachel, naked!
不能看  我在看书012---I can't look at that. I am looking at this.
好  鲜明的色彩  有力的笔触012---Okay, vivid colors, expressive brush strokes.
除非她故意让我看  就另当别论了012---Unless she wants me to be looking at that.
她知道我在家012---She knows I'm home.
她知道我看得到她012---She knows I can see her.
她这是在玩什么把戏012---What kind of game is she playing?
也许今晚有人寂寞012---I think maybe someone's lonely tonight.
盖勒博士  别胡思乱想   别自讨没趣了012---Oh, Dr. Geller.Stop it. You're being silly. Ha, ha.
真是这样吗012---Or am I?
讨厌012---Darn it!
嘿012---Hey.
我可以进去吗012---May I come in?
想要的话  就进来啊012---Uh, yeah, if you want to.
你要我进去吗012---Do you want me to?
当然了012---Yeah, sure?
彼此彼此012---So do I.
瑞秋  在一切还没开始之前012---Okay, Rach, before anything happens...
有几个原则我想先说清楚012---...I wanna lay down a couple of ground rules.
这只适用于今晚012---This is just about tonight.
今晚过后  你是你  我是我012---I won't go through with this if it'll raise the question of "us."
好吗  我希望这一切012---Okay? I just want this to be...
只是各取所需012---...about what it is.
罗斯  什么各取所需012---And, um...what is that, Ross?
出自于兽欲的性爱012---The physical act of love.
什么  你疯了不成012---What, are you crazy?
所以你刚才脱光光  不是在勾引我012---Oh so-so you weren't trying to entice me just now with your nakedness?
天啊  你有看到012---Oh, God. You saw me?
你脱光光不是在勾引我012---You weren't trying to entice me with your nakedness?
当然不是  你当真以为我想跟你上床012---Noo!! No! You thought, you actually thought I wanted to have sex with you?
才不是呢012---No.
不是012---No!
不  不  不是012---No, no, no, no.
你们等等啊012---Hey, you guys, wait!
等等我  这地方比伦敦好多了吧012---You guys. This place is so much better than London. Okay?
有个打扮成埃及艳后的女士  给了我这张折价票012---This lady dressed like Cleopatra gave me a coupon,
不用一块美元  就能吃到牛排龙虾晚餐012---Ninety-nine cent steak and lobster dinner. Huh.
菲比  你又不吃肉012---Phoebe, You don't eat animals.
不用一美元  我连你都吃012---For ninety-nine cents I'd eat you.
我完全可以耗在这里  我要的东西应有尽有012---Okay, I can totally settle down here. It's got everything I could ever want.
就连乔伊都在  你们看012---Including Joey! Look!
快点看   天啊012---Oh! Look! Hey! Oh, my God.
嘿  乔伊012---Hey, Joey!
嗨012---Hey!! Wow! Hi.
你的保险套真不赖012---Love your condoms, my man.
你们怎么会在这里  不是要你们别来了嘛012---What-what are you guys doing here? I thought I told you not to come.
你干嘛打扮成神鬼战士012---Why are you dressed as a gladiator?
因为我正在拍戏  我扮演神鬼战士012---Uh, because I'm shooting a scene right now.Yeah, I uh, I play a gladiator.
你们等等012---Uh, y'know what? Hold-hold on a second.
可以卡一下吗  我朋友来了  我要休息一下012---Can we cut? My friends are here. I'm gonna take a break.
你是在跟谁说话012---Who are you talking to?
导演啊  就是她012---The director.Uh, her.
好啦  我不是在拍神鬼战士  我在这里工作012---All right, all right, it's not a gladiator movie. I work here.
为什么  发生了什么事012---Why? What happened?
那部电影因为没钱而停拍012---The movie shutdown because they ran out of money,
我在这里工作  等电影重新开拍  如果真有这一天的话012---so I'm working here 'til it starts up again, if it ever does.
我真的很遗憾012---I'm so sorry. Such a drag.
对不起   没跟你们说  抱歉012---Look, I'm sorry I didn't tell ya. I'm sorry man.
没关系  互相隐瞒显然成了新的规矩012---No-no, that's okay, apparently there's a new policy where we don't have to share everything with everybody.
我就知道你听了会有疙瘩012---I knew you weren't okay with that.
你是神鬼战士012---So you're a gladiator!
他们怎么了012---Yeah, what-what's going on?
摩妮卡跟理查吃了中饭012---Monica had lunch with Richard.
理查道森012---Dawson?
不是啦  要不然一定超酷的012---No...But that would've been so cool!
是那个男朋友理查012---Her boyfriend Richard.
那根本不碍事  你怎么到现在还不相信我012---It meant nothing. Okay? After all this time, how can you not trust me?
你瞒着我跟大胡子帅哥吃午餐  要我怎么相信你012---When you go lunching with hunky moustache men and don't tell me about it!
你说的对  对不起  我早该跟你说的012---You're right. I'm sorry. I should've told you.
谢谢  这样才对嘛012---Thanks. Aww, there we go.
我爱赌城012---Now I love Vegas.
我保证下次一定会跟你说012---I promise you next time I absolutely will tell you.
"下一次"012---"Next time"?
功亏一篑012---Ooh, so close.
下不为例  你不能再跟他见面012---There's not gonna be a next time! You can not ever see him again!
我不能跟他见面  你不能对我发号施令012---I cannot see him? You can't tell me what to do.
很有趣   刚才不就是了012---That's so funny, because I think I just did!
你这种态度  我眼不见为净  我无所谓012---Oh y'know what? If you act like this, I don't even want to be around you. Fine with me!
好  纪念日快乐012---Fine! Happy Anniversary!
你们别这样嘛  这显然是个大误会012---Whoa! Whoa! Guys! Please! Come on, come on.This is obviously a misunderstanding.
才不是误会  你在说什么012---No, it's not. What're you talking about?
别看我  我只是在这里工作012---Hey-hey don't look at me! I just work here!
罗斯  我有点热  要脱毛衣012---Okay, um, Ross? I'm a little warm, so I'm gonna be taking off my sweater. Now, 
我只是要你知道  这不是在勾引你一夜情012---I'm just letting you know...this is not an invitation to the physical act of love.
对  真是太爆笑了012---Yep, that's hilarious.
抱歉  我不闹了012---I'm sorry. I'm done. I'm done.
昨晚对你其实也很尴尬012---You know, last night was embarrassing for you too.
也不尽然  我只是没有那么容易尴尬012---No, not really. I mean I just don't embarrass that easily.
什么  你根本尴尬得要死012---What? You totally get embarrassed.
才没有  罗斯  这是因为我比你更有安全感012---No, I don't. Ross, I think I'm just a more secure person than you are.
是吗  是啊012---Is that so? Yeah.
小姐  不管你有多想012---Hey, lady! I don't care how much you want it, okay?
我绝不会和你去厕所做爱012---I am not gonna have sex with you in the bathroom!
在古罗马时代  这不只是顶帽子而已012---Hey, You know, in Roman times, this was more than just a hat.
是吗  当然了012---Really? Yeah, sure, sure.
这可以用来刷地板012---They would scrub the floors with it!
抹去鞋子上的泥巴012---They'd use it to get the mud off their shoe.
有时候  马腹会弄脏  把这个戮进去就能012---And sometimes underneath the horse would get dirty.So they would stick it right...
乔伊  真不敢相信  我的周年纪念日是这样过的012---Joey, I uh! I can't believe this is how I'm spending my anniversary.
但我带你去个好地方012---I'll take you someplace nice.
今天有个人赏我一百美元小费012---Look! A guy tipped me $100 bucks today. Whoa!
他玩21点  才一小时就赢了五千美元012---Yeah-yeah, He was playing blackjack for an hour and he won $5000.
你相信吗  五千美元啊012---Can you believe that? $5,000!
若我赢了五千美元  我就去加入健身房012---Y'know, If I won $5000, I'd join a gym.
把我的上半身练壮  再用棍子插理查的屁眼012---y'know build up my upper body and hit Richard from behind with a stick.
等等   我何不效仿那个人012---Wait a minute! Why don't I do what that guy did?
把这一百元变成五千012---I'll take this $100, and turn it into $5000
到时再连三翻  就有钱让电影重新开拍了012---...And then I'll turn that into enough money to get my movie going again!
祝你好运了012---Good luck.
钱德  我不需要好运012---Chandler! I don't need luck.
我已经想透了  我懂了012---I've thought this through. I see.
谢谢你  谢谢012---Thank you. Thanks.
不敢相信  今晚真是糟透了012---I can't believe this. This is like the worst night ever.
摩妮卡  你和钱德的关系有了小小挂折012---Y'know Monica you had a minor setback in your relationship with Chandler.
有啥大不了的  不过是钱德罢了012---Big deal. It's only Chandler.
我真的很遗憾012---I am so sorry.
我们吵架的理由太蠢了  我根本不想再跟理查见面012---This is crazy! it's such a stupid argument. I don't even wanna see Richard again.
那就去挽回啊  去找钱德  他八成就待在你房间里012---So go fix it. Go find Chandler! He's probably up in your room.
跟他说对不起  说你爱他012---Tell him that you're sorry and that you love him.
菲比  你说的对  谢谢你  小意思012---You're right, Phoebe. You're right. Thank you. Sure.
好啊  叫赌城第一名012---Yeah! Las Vegas! Number one!
这是谁掉的吗  下注吧012---Anybody lose this? Coming out.
下好012---Place your bet.
离手012---Dice her out.
一赔二   不还本012---Double or nothin'! Pay the front line!
我正好要去厕所012---So, uh, I'm on my way back to the bathroom.
好啦  继续走就是了012---All right, all right. Just keep walking, all right?
罗斯  你干嘛  先生  对不起  他太喜欢你了012---Ross! What are you... I am sorry, sir. I think he just really likes you.
嘿   你知道那个老师吗   跟学生生孩子的那个012---Hey...You know that teacher who had a baby with her student?
搞什么012---What the? What…
嗨  小姐  需要我效劳吗012---Miss? Can I help you?
对  不好意思  你们有多的裤子吗012---Yes. I'm sorry. Do you have any extra pants?
我朋友出了点小状况012---Uh, my friend seems to have had a little accident.
可以换百元筹码吗   换百元筹码012---Can I change 100?  Changing 100.
先生  祝您好运  谢了012---Good luck, sir. Thanks.
全押了012---Let's ride.
13点  再来012---Thirteen. Hit me!
要命012---Oh, man!
慢着012---Wait!
钱德  说了你一定不相信012---Chandler! You are not gonna believe this!
我找到我的双胞手了012---I have found my identical hand twin.
什么012---What?
我的双胞手啊012---My identical hand twin!
什么是双胞手012---What's an identical hand twin?
听起来像什么  有个人的手跟我一模一样012---It was incredible. The dealer's hands were exactly like mine.
就跟照镜子没两样012---It-it was like looking at my hands in a mirror!
你确定不是在照镜子012---Are you sure you weren't looking at your hands in a mirror?
你不懂这件事的意义吗012---Don't you see what this means?
我大可忘了那部蠢电影012---I can forget about that stupid movie.
我就要变成百万富翁了012---I'm gonna be a millionaire!
怎么变012---How?
我还没有完全想出来  不过保证很有赚头012---Look, I don't have it all worked out yet.But it's gotta mean big money.
拜托  一模一样的手啊012---Come on, identical hands!
我得再问一次  怎么赚012---Again, I must go back to...how?
