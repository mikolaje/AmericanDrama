除了祝他幸福  我还要012---Oh, I'm gonna give him something besides joy. Just--
那个角色根本就是为我而写的  不敢相信我竟然落选012---That part was perfect for me. I can't believe I didn't get it.
很遗憾012---I'm sorry, man.
你知道该怎么做吗012---You know what you should do?
你要自己创造机会012---You should make something happen for yourself.
例如  写部电影剧本012---You know, like write a play.
就像《心灵捕手》那两个012---Write a movie, huh? What about those Good Will Hunting guys?
罗斯  少作白日梦了  就算我写出剧本012---Come on, Ross. Be realistic, you know? If I did write something...
哪有办法请到他们来演012---...what are the chances I could get those guys to star in it?
有了  我可以自己主演  也可以012---Wait a second. I could star in it! Or that.
我不会写剧本  我的意思是  我是演员012---I can't write, you know. I mean, I'm an actor.
我没受过编剧的训练  我办不到012---I don't have the discipline that it takes, you know. I can't do it.
我可以帮你012---I'll help you.
帮你订出时间表  盯着你乖乖照做012---Yeah. I'll make up a schedule and make sure you stick to it.
这样我自己也有事做了012---Plus it'll give me something to do.
真的  你愿意帮我  对  谢谢012---Really? You'd do that for me? Thanks. Yeah.
开始慢慢来  今晚之前012---We'll start off slow. The only thing you have to do tonight...
只要想好主角名字012---...is come up with the name of your main character.
好了  不能是乔伊012---Done. And it can't be Joey.
不是  也不能是约瑟夫012---It's not. Or Joseph.
嗨  你怎么啦012---Hi. What's up?
我刚看到丹尼跟女生搭地铁012---I just saw Danny getting on the subway with a girl...
他还搂着她012---...and he had his arm around her.
宝贝  我真为你难过012---Oh, honey, I'm sorry.
你的确该难过  一切都要怪你012---Well, you should be. This is all your fault.
谁叫你插手我们的感情世界012---You meddled in our relationship.
你们根本没在一起012---You had no relationship.
不过我已经拟好计划012---No, but I was doing my thing, and everything...
一切都按部就班进行中012---...was going according to the plan!
拜托  别再提你的鸟计划了012---Oh, God. Stop with the plan.
那么  你看到他跟女生在一起012---Unh. So what if you saw him with a girl?
又如何  他们不见得是情人012---Who cares? That doesn't mean anything.
你就快跟丹尼约会了  到时你可以火力全开  迷得他012---You'll go out on a date with Danny and be so charming he'll forget all about...
忘记地铁那个蠢妞012---...that stupid subway girl.
那女生的确傻里傻气的012---She was kind of stupid.
你说得对  好  我这就去赴约012---You're right. All right. I'm just gonna go on the date.
我会去赴约  这就是我的新计划012---I'm just gonna go on the date. That is the new plan.
快点  快点012---Hurry, hurry!
"多疑" 怎么写  干嘛012---Hey, how do you spell "suspicious"? Why?
因为这个角色很 "多疑"012---Because I think this character is gonna be suspicious about stuff.
对012---Yes!
钱德宾7分  钱德宾0分012---Chandler Bing, seven, Chandler Bing, zero.
看你玩那个都快让我抓狂了012---You're driving me crazy with that.
好  我不玩就是了  不  继续玩012---Okay, I'll stop. No, don't stop.
碗拿远一点  连罗斯都投得进012---Move the bowl further away. Ross could make that shot.
真是酷死了  不过你至少进了成人组012---Well, you suck. But at least you suck at a man's game now.
要不要玩  我不能跟你玩012---You wanna play? I can't be playing games.
罗斯就快回来了  按照他的时间表  我今天应该写完5页012---Ross will be home soon. I have to write five pages to stick to his schedule.
你可以先玩30分钟  再继续用功到他回家012---Well, so play for the next 30 minutes, then you can write until he gets home.
好吧012---All right.
不过  规则应该012---But, listen, what do you say we, uh...
更上一层楼012---...crank it up a notch?
愿闻其详012---I'm intrigued.
要先找到可燃性液体012---All right. All we need is a little lighter fluid.
好  不过你小心点  我还想拿回房租订金012---Okay, but be careful. I wanna get our security deposit back.
我们发明铁鎚标枪时  就拿不回来了012---Yeah, I think we said goodbye to that when we invented hammer darts.
你记得哪面墙壁没补过吗012---Do you remember which part of the wall is not spackle?
记得  这里012---Uh, yeah, right here.
谢谢  佳节愉快012---Thank you. Happy holiday.
小姐  那可是垃圾  不可以012---No, that's trash, young lady. No, you can't--
嘿  阻止那位小姐  她竟然捐垃圾012---Hey. Stop that young lady! She donated trash!
嘿012---Hey.
捐筒着火了012---The charity's on fire!
来人啊  太好了  谢谢  我正需要012---Help! Good, thank you. I need that.
那是什么鬼东西  现在才早上9点啊012---What is this? It's 9:00 in the morning.
我看看“场景  房间012---All right. "A room.
一名男子  多疑地走进来”012---A man enters. He looks suspicious."
就这样012---That's it?
乔伊  你今天应该写5页012---Joey, you were supposed to have five pages done by now...
还包括一个高潮012---...including an exciting incident.
这是什么垃圾  "大火球游戏规则"012---What is all this? "The Official Rulebook of Fireball."
对啊  我们刚在玩这游戏012---Yeah, that's the game we played.
很好玩  道具就是一颗网球  一个碗  可燃液体012---Yeah, it's great. You take a tennis ball, a bowl and lighter fl--
这对你的事业有帮助吗  我还以为你想当演员012---This is helping your career, huh? You wanted to be an actor.
不是发明危险游戏被人告012---Not the creator of Crazy Lawsuit Game.
你说得对  我该工作了012---You're right, you're right. I'll get back to work.
你真不应该  还带坏他  明知道乔伊应该要工作012---And shame on you. You should know better. Joey needs to work.
振作点012---Now come on. Hey.
嘿  不行  等你写完5页才还你012---No, uh-uh. You can have this back when the five pages are done, huh?
我今晚很开心  我也是012---I had a really nice time tonight. So did I.
幸好摩妮卡约我们出来012---I'm really glad Monica asked us out.
我很想请你进去  不过我妹来了住我家012---I'd love to ask you in but my sister's visiting.
她可能睡在沙发上了  你妹妹012---I think she's asleep on the couch. Your sister?
你妹妹睡在沙发上012---Your sister's asleep on the couch?
喔  我上次看到你们一起搭地铁  现在她还睡在你沙发上012---Ah, I saw you with her on the subway and now she's asleep on the couch.
我就猜是你  太好了  你起床了012---Oh, I thought I heard you. Oh, hey, great, you're up.
瑞秋  这是我妹妹克莉丝塔  克莉丝塔  这是瑞秋012---Rachel, my sister Krista. Krista, Rachel.
嗨  很高兴认识你012---Hi. Nice to meet you.
你应该告诉我要带朋友回来  害我穿得邋里邋遢的012---Wish you told me we were having company. I'd have fixed myself.
有差吗  你真恶劣012---Like it would help. You are so bad.
是你  是你012---You are. You are.
是你  是你  是你  是你012---You are. You are. You are. You are!
你完蛋了012---You are so dead. Ha.
我要教训你一顿012---I'm gonna get you. Aah!
很高兴认识你012---Um, it's very nice to meet you.
没有人  没一个人尊重募捐筒012---Nobody. Nobody respects the bucket.
大家都丢些莫名其妙的东西012---You wouldn't believe what people put in here.
你觉得这像012---Look. Okay, does this look like...
垃圾桶吗  不像012---...a garbage can to you? No.
像烟灰缸吗  不像012---Does it look like an ashtray? No.
像尿桶吗012---Does it look like a urinal?
呀哦012---Ew!
菲比  你还要回去募捐吗  当然  不过我受够了012---So, Pheebs, you gonna go back out there? Yeah, but I'm not gonna take any more crap.
再也不当募捐好好小姐012---Okay? No more Mrs. Nice Bucket.
加油  你在街上流浪过  够强悍啊012---Yeah, good for you. You're tough. You lived on the street.
我要当回强悍菲比012---Yeah, I'm gonna go back to being Street Phoebe.
不过  也不能全当回去012---Yeah. Oh, but you know what? I can't go totally back...
因为  强悍菲比才不会鸟你们012---...because Street Phoebe really wouldn't be friends with you guys.
嘿012---Hey. Hey.
可以问个问题吗  当然012---Um, can I ask you guys something? Sure.
我没有兄弟  实在不了解  不过你们会打来打去吗012---Urn, I don't have any brothers so I don't know, but did you guys wrestle?
当然会  常常啊012---Oh, yeah. All the time.
而且  我从没输过012---In fact, I was undefeated.
因为你以前90多公斤012---Well, you weighed 200 pounds.
不过我还是跟猫咪一样矫捷012---Still, I was quick as a cat.
我昨天遇到丹尼的妹妹012---Well, I met Danny's sister yesterday.
就是跟他一起搭地铁的那个  真的假的012---Uh, that was the girl on the subway. Oh, you're kidding.
他们非常012---And they were very, you know...
会扭打012---...wrestle-y.
这样正常吗012---But I guess that's normal?
我们现在不会这样了012---We don't wrestle now.
我长大变得强壮后就不打了012---Not since I got too strong for you. Ha, ha.
长大变壮  对012---Too strong for me? Yeah.
你要比划一下吗012---You wanna go right now?
我可以立刻打败你  信不信012---Because I'll take you right now, buddy. You wanna go?
没问题012---Oh, fine.
预备012---Ready?
开始012---Wrestle!
这个嘛  很好012---Okay, you know what, um?
谢谢你们  帮了大忙012---Actually, that's great. That helps a lot. Thanks.
赶快走  20分后球赛就要开打了  乔伊  快点012---Guys, come on, let's go. The puck drops in 20 minutes. Come on. Joey.
乔伊不能去  我还没写完5页012---Joey's not going. I didn't finish my five pages.
明天再写不就成了012---Why can't you finish them tomorrow?
因为他明天要修改昨天的5页012---Because tomorrow he's redoing yesterday's pages.
我昨天写的有所改进012---Yesterday's pages did not reflect my best work.
别再逼他  让他透口气  搞不好会写得更好012---Why don't you cut him a little slack? Maybe if he relaxes, he'll get some work done.
他已经透够多气了  这都要感谢你012---I think he's been relaxing enough, thanks to you...
跟大火球012---...and Fireball.
玩大火球可是很紧张  显然你没玩过012---If you think Fireball's relaxing, you obviously have never played.
你拼命压榨乔伊  是因为你太无聊了012---The only reason you're doing this to Joey is you're bored.
又不是乔伊害你失业的012---It's not his fault that you're unemployed.
我不是失业  只是进修中012---I am not unemployed. I'm on sabbatical.
伙计们  你们别吵架012---Look, look. Guys, don't fight.
我之所以这么做  是因为我是乔伊的朋友012---And the reason I'm doing this is because I am Joey's friend.
如果你也是他好友  就该跟我一样012---And if you were a good friend, you'd be doing the same thing.
当好友就得这么混帐012---So being a good friend means acting like a jerk?
要是真如你所说  你可真是我第一号好友012---If it does, then you're an amazing friend of mine.
别吵了  何不大家玩场大火球  尽弃前嫌012---Hey, guys. How about we settle this over a friendly game of Fireball, huh?
我去拆掉防火警铃  何不现在就一了百了012---I'll go unhook the smoke detectors. How about we settle this right now?
好了  谁也不准去看球赛012---There. Now no one's going to the game. Ha-ha-ha.
门票是我买的  才怪012---I paid for those tickets. No, you didn't.
你每次都说要付钱  却一次也没吐过钱  也对012---You said you would, but you never did. Oh, yeah.
我们终于爬到山顶012---So we finally get to the top of the mountain, ahem...
结果这个笨蛋竟然忘了相机012---...and airhead here forgets the camera.
我也发生过这种事情012---You know, that same thing happened to me one time.
什么时候012---When did that happen to you?
记不记得  上次我们不是到公园慢跑  看到那只可爱小鸟012---Don't you remember? We were jogging in the park, we saw that pretty bird.
结果想拍  我竟然没带相机012---And I wanted to take a picture but I didn't have my camera.
也对  不过追小贩可不算慢跑012---Okay. First of all, chasing the churro guy is not jogging.
超好吃  你一定要吃一口012---Oh, this is so good. You have got to try it.
真不错012---That is good.
糟糕  裤子沾到了  我来擦012---Oh, damn. I got it on my pants. Here, I'll get it.
最好上楼换件裤子 否则以后洗不掉012---We better take these off or that stain will set.
而且我今晚约会还要穿  喔  真好012---I wanna wear these pants on our date tonight. Oh, great.
再见  老天爷啊012---Okay, bye. Oh, my God.
不可思议  看吧  我早说过了012---That was unbelievable. Okay, see? I told you.
可怜的瑞秋  我不相信他们是兄妹012---Yeah, wow. Sorry, Rash. I don't believe they're brother and sister.
他们是兄妹012---They're brother and sister?
等一下  手张开  让我检查012---Wait a minute. Open your hand. Let me take a look.
两毛五  一毛  线头不要012---Quarter, dime. Lint? Not interested in that.
这是什么  加拿大硬币  滚蛋012---What's this? A Canadian coin? Get out of here!
天啊012---Gosh.
不准在募捐筒旁边喝东西012---Whoa. No drinks near the bucket.
先放在那边  才准捐款012---Set it down over there and then you can make a contribution.
少装一副可怜兮兮的样子012---And you can leave the "hurt bunny" look over there too.
嗨  鲍柏  不是叫你滚蛋了吗012---Hi, Bob. I thought I told you to get out of here!
菲比  我们接到申诉012---Uh, Phoebe, we've been getting complaints.
上面要调你离开012---And we're gonna move you to a less high-profile spot.
什么012---What?
以后这里由金洁负责  这小妞才没这能耐012---Uh, Ginger's gonna take over this corner. That chick can't handle my corner.
你不走  我们就得赶你走012---Look, either you leave or we remove you.
好012---Fine.
劝你一句  注意那个臭婆娘012---All right, I'll give you one pointer. Look out for that bitch.
瑞秋  不是约的7点吗  我看  今天就算了012---Oh, hey, Rach. I thought we said 7. Yeah, uh, you know what? Uh, let's skip it.
什么  为什么012---What? Uh, why?
你看012---Um... Look.
你们兄妹似乎  非常要好012---You and your sister seem to have, um, a very special bond--
太好了  又说这句话012---Oh, great. That "special bond" again.
我跟我妹感情好  又是哪里让人看不顺眼了012---Why do women have such a problem with the fact that I'm close with my sister?
听我说  我不知道事实真相  你有兄弟吗012---Okay, look, I don't know, but-Do you have brothers?
没有  我有两个姊姊  其中一个很像男人婆012---No, I have two sisters, but one of them actually has a very masculine energy.
你们要好吗  不  她们不是好人012---Are you close with them? No, no. They're not very nice people.
好  过来  听着012---Okay, come here. Listen.
我真的很喜欢你  交往下去应该会有结果012---I really like you, okay? I think this could go somewhere.
