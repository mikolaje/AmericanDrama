亲切版帅哥服务生012---The one that looks like a non-threatening Ray Liotta?
就是他012---Aha. That one!
我马上就闪人  我只是回来拿件外套012---Y'know what, just give me a second and I'll be out of your hair. I'm just going to grab a jacket.
等我回来  可要告诉我详情012---When I get back, I want every little detail.
他可能来了012---Maybe that's him.
好的  好的012---Okay, um... Okay, um...
只是乔伊跟罗斯012---It's just Joey and Ross.
你们不是去看电影吗012---Why aren't you at the movie?
对啊  可是罗斯打电话太吵  被电影院轰出来了012---We were, but Ross was talking so loud on his phone, they threw us out.
电影太吵  我当然得大声讲012---I had to talk loud because the movie was loud!
他打电话去伦敦  天啊  找到艾蜜莉了012---He's talking to London. My God.Did he get in touch with Emily?
还没  他打给女方所有的亲戚012---Well no, not yet. He's calling everyone on her side of the family
希望有人愿意帮他联络艾蜜莉012---...hoping someone will help him get in touch with her.
就算我说错名字又怎样  你这大惊小怪的笨蛋012---I don't care if I said some other girl's name, you prissy old twit!
罗斯012---Ross.
你给人家拍马屁拍得可真好啊012---Way to suck up to the family!
真高兴大家都在  公司终于买到防皱传真纸了012---I'm so glad you guys are all here! My office finally got wrinkle-free fax paper!
老友记  第五季  第04集  菲比讨厌PBS（美国广播公司）012---Friends  S05E04  The One Where Phoebe Hates PBS
嘿  别过来  那是呕吐西装012---Hey Oh, no, no! Vomit tux! No, no! Vomit tux!
放心  我干洗过了012---Don't worry, I had it dry-cleaned.
呕吐西装012---Vomit tux?
谁会吐在...012---Who vomited on...
算了  乔伊  你为何穿成这样012---You know what? What you up to, Joe?
我要上马拉松式电视节目012---They're doing this telethon thing on TV.
我的经纪人帮我争取当主持人012---And my agent got me a job as co-host!
太棒了012---That's great!
帮公视做好事  又能增加曝光率012---A little good deed for PBS, plus some TV exposure.
我乔伊最爱做这种美事了012---That's the kind of math Joey likes to do.
公视啊012---Oh, PBS!
公视哪里不对了  他们哪里对012---What's wrong with PBS? What's right with them?
你为何不喜欢公视012---Why don't you like PBS?
因为我妈自杀之后  我孤苦伶仃非常难过012---Okay, 'cause right after my mom killed herself,I was just in this really bad place, you know, personally.
所以我想写信给《芝麻街》  心情应该会好一点012---So I just thought it would make me feel better if I wrote to Sesame Street.
因为我小时候  总觉得他们很亲切012---Because they were so nice when I was a little kid.
结果根本没人回信012---No one ever wrote back.
那些布偶根本没有手指  写不了信012---Well y'know a lot of those Muppets don't have thumbs.
我只收到一个烂钥匙环  拜托  我那时住在纸箱里012---All I got was a lousy key chain! And by that time I was living in a box.
连钥匙都没有012---I didn't have keys!
我很遗憾  菲比  我只是012---I'm sorry, Pheebs.I just wanted to
想做好事  就像你帮忙生小孩012---do a good deed, like you did with the babies.
你才不是做善事012---This isn't a good deed.
只是想上电视  根本就很自私012---You just want to get on TV. This is totally selfish.
你帮弟弟生小孩又怎么说012---What about you having those babies for your brother?
自私的不是只有我012---Talk about selfish!
你胡说什么012---What are you talking about?
你的确是帮忙他们  不过自己心情也很好吧012---Well, yeah, it was a really nice thing and all, but it made you feel really good right?
那又如何012---Yeah, so?
因为你做善事心情好  也算是自私的一种012---It made you feel good so that makes it selfish.
世界上根本就没有无私的好事012---Look, there's no unselfish good deeds. Sorry.
明明就有  有很多行善的人都没有私心012---Yes, there are totally good deeds that are selfless!
请你举出一个例子012---May I ask for one example?
就是有  例如012---Yeah, it's... You know, there's...
我不想说012---No, you may not!
因为所有人都很自私012---That's because all people are selfish.
你说我自私012---Are you calling me selfish?
你难道不是人012---Are you calling you people?
菲比  很抱歉戳破你的美梦  世界上没有无私的善事012---Sorry to burst that bubble, Pheebs, but selfless good deeds don't exist.
好吗012---Okay?
你也知道圣诞老人吧  对吧012---And you know the deal on Santa Claus, right?
我一定会找到一件无私的善事  打败你这个  邪恶博士012---I'm gonna find a selfless good deed. I'm going to beat you, you evil genius!
喂  罗斯吗012---Hello? Hello, Ross?
艾蜜莉012---Emily?
天啊   是艾蜜莉012---Oh, my God! Oh my God, It's Emily!
各位  是艾蜜莉  别吵012---It's Emily, everyone! Shh! Shh! Shh!
罗斯  我打来只是要告诉你  别再骚扰我家人了  再见012---Ross, I'm only ringing to say stop harassing my relatives. Goodbye.
等一下  就算你挂断  我也会继续打  如果要打给所有英国人012---Wait! Okay,Okay, you can hang up, but I'm gonna keep calling! I'm gonna, I'm gonna call everyone in England
才能逼你跟我说话  我也办得到012---if that's what it takes to get you to talk to me!
真的  你想谈什么012---Really? About what?
你是我太太  我们已经结婚012---Look, you're my wife. We're married.
而且我爱你012---You know, I love you.
我很想你012---I really miss you.
我也很想你012---I miss you too.
至少我认为如此012---Well, at least I think I do.
她肯跟我说话了012---She's talking.
嘿  乔伊  你刚刚  为何提到圣诞老人012---Hey, Joey, When you said "the deal with Santa Claus," you meant?
根本没有这号人物012---That he doesn't exist.
这样啊012---Right.
钱德  你听说  摩妮卡的地下情人了吗012---So Chandler, have you heard about Monica's secret boyfriend?
知道  她...她是提过012---Uhh, yeah. She uh, she uh, she might have mentioned him.
我们到底何时  才能认识这个服务生012---So, Mon, when are we going to meet this new, secret waiter man?
他很害羞  我想现在还没准备  认识大家吧012---He's really shy. I don't think he's up to meeting everyone yet.
我想他还没准备好012---Yeah, I don't think he's up to meeting everyone yet.
我不管  我想见他  她说他床上功夫一级棒012---I don't care, I wanna meet this guy who's the best sex she ever had.
真的012---Really?
有这样的评论  你说过012---That's what you heard? You said that?
大概吧012---I might have said that.
这有什么好笑012---Why is that funny?
因为我为他高兴012---Because I'm very happy for him.
你真是  走狗运012---And you! You lucky dog!
嗨  嘿012---Hi. Hey.
艾蜜莉愿意跟我破镜重圆012---Well, Emily's willing to work on the relationship.
太好了  好啊012---That's great! Yes!
在伦敦啊012---In London.
什么  她要我搬到伦敦去012---What? She wants me to move to London.
可是你住在这里012---But you live here.
我这是废话012---You know that.
你打算怎么办012---What-what-what are you gonna do?
只要跟卡萝  苏珊谈谈012---I bet if I talked to Carol and Susan...
一定能说服她们带小班搬到伦敦012---...I could convince them to move to London with Ben.
想必你前妻一定乐意搬到国外去012---I'm sure your ex-wife would be more than happy to move to another country...
帮你挽回新太太012---...so you can patch things up with your new wife.
不是不可能啊012---It could happen.
你好  欢迎  幸会012---How you doing? Welcome. Good to see you.
这就是你的电话012---This'll be your phone.
真好012---That's great.
不过应该没有人会打来找我012---But I'm not really expecting a lot of calls.
你负责接电话接受捐款012---No, you answer it and take pledges.
我是主持人012---But I'm the host.
不  盖瑞卡林才是主持人  你负责接电话012---No, Gary Collins is the host. You'll be answering the phone.
你恐怕搞不清楚状况  我是雷莫瑞医生012---You don't seem to understand. See, I was Dr. Drake Ramoray.
你负责这支电话  医生012---Well, here's your phone, doctor.
我竟然找不到一件无私的善行012---I can't believe I can't find a selfless good deed.
以前我家隔壁有个老头012---You know that really old guy that lives next door to me?
我偷溜到他家  帮他打扫前廊的落叶012---I snuck over there and raked up all the leaves on his front stoop.
他捉到我之后  强迫我喝西打  吃饼干012---But he caught me, and he force-fed me cider and cookies.
可是我却很开心  那个呆子012---Then I felt wonderful. That old jackass!
或许乔伊说得对  所有好事的出发点都有私心012---Maybe Joey's right. Maybe all good deeds are selfish.
我一定要找到一件无私的善行  毕竟我才刚生出三个宝宝012---I will find a selfless good deed. Because I just gave birth to three children...
不能让他们在  乔伊认为有理的世界里长大012---...and I will not let them be raised in a world where Joey's right!
摩妮卡  可以问你有关烹饪的问题吗012---Hey, Monica? Can I ask you a cooking question?
当然  如果你用炉子烹饪012---Sure. If you're cooking on the stove...
是否代表你新的地下男友在床上  比理查还厉害012---...does that mean that your new secret boyfriend is better in bed than Richard?
钱德012---Chandler.
有吗012---Is he?
我要尊重秘密新男友的隐私012---Well, y'know I think I'm going to respect the privacy of my new, secret boyfriend.
为什么012---Why?
如果我是他012---I mean If this guy was me...
又知道  自己是你碰过最棒的情人012---...and it's me who'd learned that it was me who was the best you'd ever had...
我一定会手舞足蹈的012---...I'd be going like this
好吧  艾蜜莉012---All right, Emily.
虽然我很爱你012---As much as I love you...
但是我不能丢下小班去伦敦012---...I'm sorry, I can't move to London without Ben.
我知道这很为难你012---I understand that would be difficult.
请你考虑搬过来好吗   你本来就打算搬来012---Would you please consider moving here? I mean You were moving here anyway.
为何不现在就来呢012---Why can't you just do that?
我不知道  只是012---I don't know. It's just...
好  我知道自己到目前为止  表现都这样白痴012---Okay, okay, but I know that even though I've been a complete idiot up till now...
但是你还是应该过来012---...you have to come here.
过来嘛  我们才能继续走下去012---You have to, so we can work this out together.
好吧012---All right.
好吧  你刚说 "好吧"012---All right? Did you just say "all right"?
没错  现在换我是白痴了012---I did. Now I'm the idiot.
艾蜜莉  太棒了012---Emily, that is so great!
会很棒的012---It's gonna be so great!
我们就像坠入爱河的一对白痴012---We're going to be like two idiots in love!
罗斯  有件是还是让我很担心012---Ross, there's one thing that really scares me still.
你尽管说  你要知道012---Yes, tell me. You have to understand...
当天婚礼我在012---...how humiliating it was for me up on that altar...
亲朋好友面前有多丢脸012---...in front of my entire family, all my friends.
我知道  我非常抱歉012---I know. I am so sorry.
当我决定原谅你012---And then, after deciding to forgive you...
却看到你跟她赶着上飞机012---...seeing you at the airport, catching our plane with her.
这也是我的错012---Again, very sorry.
我根本无法与她共处一室012---I mean, I can't be in the same room as her.
我光想到你跟她共处一室  就快气坏了012---It drives me mad thinking of you being in the same room as her.
艾蜜莉  我跟瑞秋根本没什么012---Emily, there is nothing between Rachel and me.
好吗012---Okay?
我爱的是你012---I love you.
好吧012---All right.
我去纽约  我们再试试看012---I'll come to New York and we'll try to make this work.
太好了012---That is so great!
只要你答应不再见瑞秋012---As long as you don't see Rachel anymore.
我就问艾蜜莉愿不愿意来纽约012---So I asked Emily if she would come to New York.
她答应了012---And she said yes.
太好了  不  不  不012---Yes! Ooh-ohh! No, no, no.
条件是我不准再见瑞秋012---Only if I promise never to see Rachel again.
什么  那怎么行012---What? You can't...
你怎么说012---What did you tell her?
我说在考虑012---I told her I'd have to think about it.
我到底该怎么决定012---I mean, how the hell am I supposed to make this kind of a decision?
我这是在问你们012---I'm actually asking you!
你不能就此不见瑞秋012---Well, you can't just not see Rachel anymore.
她是你的好朋友012---She's one of your best friends.
但是他也不能不见艾蜜莉  她是他老婆012---But he can't not see Emily, I mean that's his wife!
也是  对012---That's true! Yeah, right?
你跟瑞秋从高中就认识  不能说不见就不见012---But you've known Rachel since high school and you cannot just cut her out of your life.
你说得也对  的确不行012---That's true! No, you cannot.
谢谢你们的帮忙  问题一点也没解决012---Thanks for the help. Problem solved!
喂  摩妮卡012---Hello? Hey, Mon.
乔伊  我们看了一整天电视  你到底何时才会出现012---Oh, hey, Joey. We've been watching all day. When are you gonna be on TV?
我经纪人搞错了012---See, There was kind of a mix-up in my agent's office...
反正我上了电视   就有曝光率012---...but I'm still on TV, and that's good exposure.
你没上电视啊012---You're not on TV.
好吧  现在呢012---Oh, okay. How about now?
有了  看到他了012---Yeah! There he is! There he is!
嗨  纽约012---Hello, New York!
问题是这里有整只鸭  不过管他的012---Now maybe just put the whole duck right in there. Who cares? y'know?
我先处理鸭腿012---Now I got the legs.
我说过多少次  不准看烹饪频道012---How many times have I told you guys to never watch the cooking channel?
嗨  钱德  嘿012---Hi, Chandler. Hey.
我来要回乔伊上次借的烤盘012---Listen, I need that broiling pan that Joey borrowed the other day.
那是你的012---That was yours?
我们上次用来装小鸭吐出来的虫子012---We used it when the duck was throwing up caterpillars.

你知道吗  冠军先生012---You know what, champ?
我自愿放弃012---I think I'll pass.
为什么  为什么012---Why? Why?

乔伊012---Hey, Joey.
告诉你  我找到无私的善行了012---I just wanted to let you know that I found a selfless good deed.
我刚去公园   让蜜峰叮我012---I went down to the park and I let a bee sting me.
什么  这对谁有好处012---What good is that going to do anybody?
这只蜜峰在同伴面前  脸上有光012---It helps the bee look tough in front of his bee friends.
蜜峰很开心  我却很痛012---The bee is happy, and I am definitely not.
蜜峰叮了你就死了012---You know, the bee probably died after he stung you.
可恶012---Damn it!

好012---Okay.
够了  我下不了决心  实在太难了012---That's it. I cannot make this decision. It is too difficult.
我决定交给命运之神012---So I'm just going leave it entirely up to the gods of fate.
神奇8号球012---A Magic 8 Ball?
你开玩笑吧  怎么可以用玩具决定命运012---You can't be serious, you can't make this decision with a toy!
这可不是玩具012---Ooh, it's not a toy.
我别无选择012---I don't know what else to do!
不是追回老婆  失去好朋友012---I either keep my wife and lose one of my best friends...
就是留下朋友  在30岁前离婚两次012---...or I keep my friend and get divorced for the second time before I'm 30.
要是有人有更好的建议  现在就说出来012---So if anyone else has a better suggestion, let's hear it.
否则我真的没有办法  大家别害羞012---Because I got nothing! Don't be shy.

我要捐钱012---I'd like to make a pledge.
我想捐200元012---I would like to donate $200.
200元012---Two hundred dollars?
你确定  菲比  《芝麻街》可是伤你不浅啊012---Are you sure Pheebs? I mean, after what Sesame Street did to ya?
我还是很生气  不过我也知道很多妈妈012---I'm still mad at them, but I also know that they bring happiness...
没自杀的小孩很爱看012---...to lots of kids whose moms didn't kill themselves.
你知道的  所以012---You know, so...
为了支持这节目  我决定做件好事  不过我自己可不开心012---...by supporting them, I'm doing a good thing, but I'm not happy about it.
你看  这就是无私的善行012---So there! A selfless good deed.
难道你捐钱没有一点开心012---And you don't feel a little good about donating the money?
难过死了  我本想用那笔钱买只黄金鼠012---No, it sucks. I was saving up to buy a hamster.
黄金鼠那种宠物  10元就买得到012---A hamster? Those things are, like, 10 bucks.
我喜欢的那只可没那么便宜012---Not the one I had my eye on.
看来今年的募款  已经超过去年总额012---It looks like we have surpassed last year's pledge total.
谢谢各位012---Thank you!
打破纪录的捐款是由  我们的义工募得012---And the pledge that did it was taken by one of our volunteers.
而且这位还穿得很体面的012---Oh, boy! And may I say, one of our sharpest dressed volunteers.
这位就是  乔伊崔比亚尼012---Mr. Joseph Tribbiani!
你看012---Oh, look!
乔伊上电视了012---Joey's on TV!
太棒了012---Isn't that great?
我的捐款让乔伊上了电视  真是让我012---My pledge got Joey on TV! That makes me feel so...
糟糕012---Oh, no!
好的012---Look...
或许我先前太得意了  不过有件事要告诉你012---...maybe I got carried away before, but there's something you gotta know.
如果我表现得很好  也是因为你012---If I'm the best, it's only because you made me the best.
说下去012---Keep talking.
跟你在一起之前  我根本表现平平012---I was nothing before you.
你可以打去问我以前那些女友012---Call the other girls and ask.
你一定很快就问完了012---Which wouldn't take long.
但是我跟你在一起时012---But when I'm with you, and we're together...
我的天啊012---...oh, my God!
真的  天啊012---Really? Oh, my God!
如果你不想再跟我上床  我也能体谅012---Now, I understand if you never want to sleep with me again.
不过这决定就不对了012---But that would be wrong.
我们太厉害了012---We're too good.
不上床实在太可惜012---We owe it to sex!
