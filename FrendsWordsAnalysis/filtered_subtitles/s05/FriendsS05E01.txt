罗斯与艾蜜莉已经宣誓012---Ross and Emily have made their declarations...
我很荣幸宣布  他们结为夫妻012---...and it gives me great pleasure to declare them husband and wife.
你可以亲吻新娘了012---You may kiss the bride.
这比他娶同性恋那次更糟糕012---This is worse than when he married the lesbian.
保持微笑012---Just keep smiling.
好012---Okay...
进行得真顺利012---Well, that went well. Yeah.
他没开枪杀死她就不错了012---It could've been worse. He could've shot her.
刚刚真有点耍宝012---Ha, ha. That was pretty funny, wasn't it?
老友记  第五季  第01集  阴错阳差012---Friends  S05E01  The One After Ross Says Rachel
你搞砸所有事情  简直是恶梦一场012---You spoiled everything. It's like a nightmare.
我的亲朋好友都在场  我以后拿什么脸见人012---All my friends and family are out there. How can I face them?
你怎么做得出来012---How could you do this to me?
罗斯和艾蜜莉  不管怎样012---Hey, no matter what happens with Ross and Emily...
我们都吃得到蛋糕吧012---...we still get cake, right?
没关系  亲爱的  你慢慢来012---That's all right. No, no. You take your time, sweetie.
我在外面等你012---I'll be out here. Ha, ha.
她要补妆012---She's just fixing her makeup.
我恨你012---I hate you.
我也爱你012---And I love you.
罗斯  你偏挑这个时候  说错名字012---Boy, a bad time to say the wrong name, huh, Ross?
你说得对  谢了  老爸012---That's true. Thanks, Dad.
大家应该跳舞啊012---People should be dancing, huh?
这是婚宴  来吧012---Hey, this is a party. Come on.
乔伊  跳舞啊012---Joey. Dance.
喂   华森室内设计012---Yes, Waltham Interiors.
你好  我是罗斯盖勒的私人医生  费兰吉012---Hello, this is Ross Geller's personal physician, Dr. Phalange.
谁012---Who?
我发现罗斯忘了吃药012---Yeah, I discovered that Ross forgot to take his brain medicine.
他这人不吃药012---Um, now, without it, uh, in the brain of Ross...
就有可能讲错女人的名字012---...uh, women's names are interchangeable.
这完全不能怪他012---Through no fault of his own.
天啊  是菲比你啊012---Oh, my God. Phoebe.
我不是菲比  是费兰吉医生012---No, not Phoebe. Dr. Phalange.
你也错乱了012---Oh, no. You have it too.
喂012---Hello?
嘿  嗨012---Hey. Hey.
希望你别误会012---Wow, I hope you don't take this the wrong way...
我知道我们今晚约了要见面012---...but I know we had plans to meet up tonight and...
但是我担心以后做不成朋友012---Ugh. I'm just kind of worried about what it might do to our friendship.
我明白012---I know.
我们怎么这么不小心  还不小心了七次012---Ugh. How could we have let this happen? Seven times.
你知道  我们人在国外012---You know, look. We were away.
又是浪漫的异乡  对012---In a foreign, romantic country. Right.
都怪伦敦不好012---I blame London.
坏伦敦012---Bad London.
听着012---So look, um...
既然我们还在伦敦  就可以继续  对不对012---...while we're still in London, I mean, we can keep doing it, right?
看来我们别无选择012---Well, I don't see that we have a choice.
但是一回家就不能做了012---But when we're back home, we don't do it.
只能在这里012---Only here.
我看到楼下有酒窖012---You know, I saw a wine cellar downstairs.
我两分钟后下去找你  好012---I'll meet you there in two minutes. Okay.
摩妮卡  我有事情要问你  现在啊012---Mon? Mon, I got to ask you something. Now?
罗斯刚刚说出我的名字012---Ross said my name up there. I mean, come on.
我不能假装没听到吧012---I just can't pretend that didn't happen can I?
我不知道012---I don't know.
摩妮卡  我该怎么办  做正确的事012---Monica, what should I do? Just do the right thing.
什么012---What?
听天由命  努力争取  不要死心眼012---Tow the line. Thread the needle. Think outside the box.
等等  听着  我要问罗斯  他是什么意思012---Monica, wait, listen. I'm gonna talk to Ross about what he thinks it meant.
等等  瑞秋  不行012---Wait. Rachel, no.
他结婚了012---He's married.
结婚了012---Married.
要是你还不懂  我也没办法012---If you don't realize that, I can't help you.
你说得对012---Okay. You're right.
你说得对  你帮不了我012---You're right. You can't help me.
杰克  这是我们的错吗  没把小孩教好012---Jack, is it all our fault? Were we bad parents?
差不多吧012---Yes.
没地方坐还叫人吃牛排012---Oh yeah? Well, who serves steak when there's no place to sit?
你要我们怎么吃嘛012---I mean, how are you supposed to eat this?
你们好  怎么样012---Hey, what's up?
你去哪里了  不是约好了在酒窖碰面012---Where were you? We were supposed to meet.
算了  当我没说  为什么012---Forget it. That's off. Why?
两分钟后012---The next tour of the wine cellar...
为各位介绍酒窖012---...will commence in two minutes.
乔伊  你搞什么012---Joey, what are you doing?
你答应菲比  等她生完孩子才吃肉的012---You promised Phoebe you wouldn't eat meat until she has the babies!
既然我们在国外就不算012---Well, I figured we're in another country, so it doesn't count.
那倒是  他说得对012---That's true. The man's got a point.
嗨012---Oh, hi.
嗨  嗨012---Hi. Hi.
抱歉  事情竟然出状况012---I'm sorry things aren't working out so well.
的确不太妙  不过会解决的012---Oh, no. Ha, ha. It could be better. It's gonna be okay, right?
当然  我的意思  她不会放在心上的012---Oh, yeah. Of course. I mean, she's gonna get over this, you know?
你只不过脱口说出了我的名字012---I mean, so you said my name.
不过是因为你刚好看到我012---You know, you just said it because you saw me there.
如果你是看到怪胎  也会说012---If you'd seen a circus freak, you would've said:
我娶你  怪胎012---I take thee Circus Freak.
根本没有别的意思  只是无心之过012---It didn't mean anything. It's just a mistake.
没有别的意思012---It didn't mean anything.
对吧  不   不012---Right? No, no.
当然没有别的意思012---Of course it didn't mean anything.
但是我明白艾蜜莉为何误会012---I mean, uh well, I can understand why Emily would think it meant something...
因为这刚好是你的名字012---...you know, because it was you.
其实没有意义  真的没有  没有012---But it absolutely didn't. It didn't! It didn't!
罗斯  乐队正在等你跟艾蜜莉来开舞012---Ross, hey, the band's ready outside for your first dance with Emily,
乐队准备好了012---Oh. Oh, the band's ready.
我们最好听乐队的话012---Well, we got to do what the band says.
我才不在乎呢012---I don't care about the stupid band!
你口水喷到我了012---You spit on me, man.
对不起012---I'm sorry.
艾蜜莉也进去太久了吧012---Emily is taking kind of a long time, huh? Heh.
我结婚时也躲在厕所不出来012---Y'know When I locked myself in the bathroom at my wedding...
不过那是因为我要撬开窗户012---...it was because I was trying to pop the window out of the frame.
是啊  我心想着要逃出去012---Right. Get the hell out of there. You know?
艾蜜莉012---Emily.
我要进去了012---I'm coming in.
你看  同一招012---Oh, look at that. Same thing.
如果我中途012---In the middle of everything...
大喊 "好啊"   你就当作没听到012---...if I scream the word "yippee," just ignore me.
天啊  瑞秋  嗨  你好啊  瑞秋012---Huh! Oh, my God. Rachel. Oh, hello, Rachel.
罗斯叫出我的名字012---Ross said my name.
好吗  是我呀012---Okay? My name.
他会说成我的名字012---Ross said my name up there.
表示他还爱我012---That obviously means that he still loves me.
不信就算了  我绝对没误会012---Okay, don't believe me. I know I'm right.
你们要不要下楼喝一杯012---do you guys want to go downstairs and get a drink?
好啊012---Yes, we do.
不过我们要先换衣服012---But we have to change first.
对  我想换衣服012---Yes, I want to change.
你先下去占位子  我们五分钟就下去012---why don't you go down and get us a table? Yeah, We'll be down in five minutes.
十五分钟吧012---Fifteen minutes. Ha, ha.
哈罗012---Hello.
菲比啊  是菲比012---Oh, Pheebs. It's Phoebe.
嘿   太好了012---Oh, hey, hey. Oh, great.
嗨012---Hi.
怎么样012---So, what happened?
罗斯说成我的名字012---Well, Ross said my name.
我知道  不过他是无心的012---Yeah, I know, but I don't think that means anything.
菲比  我们冷静客观想想看012---Okay, Pheebs, y'know what, let's look at this objectively.
他从高三就暗恋我012---All right, ninth grade, right?
从那时就疯狂迷上我012---The obsession starts.
好吗  那年暑假012---All right? Summer after ninth grade...
他头一次看我穿两件式泳装012---...he sees me in a two-piece for the first time.
更是不可自拔地爱上了我  不是吗012---His obsession begins to grow, right?
嗨  听着  去我房间换衣服好了012---Hey, listen, why don't we go change in my room?
可是我的衣服在012---My clothes are... Oh.
你看起来真是   没时间废话了012---Wow, you look... No time for that.
好吧012---Okay.
老兄  让我进去  我有女伴012---Hey, dude. Let me in. I got a girl out here.
我这里也有012---Well, I've got a girl in here.
才没有  我看到你跟摩妮卡进去012---No, you don't. I just saw you go in there with Monica.
我们在里面聊天012---Well, we're hanging out in here.
你说我们  谁比较有机会上床呢012---Which one of us is gonna be having sex in there? Me or you?
看来我只能说是你了012---Well, I suppose I would have to say you.
我们正在一起看电影呢  没错012---What if we're watching a movie in here? Which we are.
我们付费了  正在看 "我的巨人"012---And we've already paid for it. It's My Giant.
"我的巨人"   我超爱那部片012---My Giant? I love that movie.
你确定这样好吗012---You really think this is okay?
反正罗斯跟艾蜜莉也用不到012---Well, Ross and Emily aren't gonna use it.
这里好漂亮012---Oh, it's so beautiful.
可是我总觉得不太妥当012---You know, I don't feel right about this.
摩妮卡012---Oh, Monica...
这是蜜月套房012---This is the honeymoon suite.
本来就该有人在这里嘿咻012---The room expects sex.
如果没有  这间房一定很失望012---The room would be disappointed if it didn't get sex.
在其他蜜月套房面前抬不起头012---All the other honeymoon suites would think it was a loser.
好吧012---Okay.
艾蜜莉  没有  这里也没看到012---Emily? Nope. Not under here.
你还没找到她  没有  我到处都找不到012---You didn't find her? No, I've looked everywhere.
你一定漏掉什么地方  否则早就找到了012---Well, you couldn't have, or else you would've found her.
你应该继续找  大概再找个30分钟012---I think you should keep looking. Yeah. For about, uh, 30 minutes?
或是45分钟012---Or 45?
45分钟可以找到两次了012---Wow, in 45 minutes, you could find her twice.
不了  她一定也找不到我012---No. For all I know, she's trying to find me...
因为我跑来跑去012---...but couldn't because I kept moving around.
从现在开始  我不跑了012---No, from now on, I'm staying in one place.
我就待在这里012---Right here.
时间晚了  我们要走了012---It's getting late. Yeah, We're going to go.
这个012---Actually...
在这里待一会儿如何012---...do you guys mind staying here for a while?
可是我们明天一早  就要搭机回纽约012---Ugh. You know, we got to get up early and catch that plane to New York.
而且那班飞机又很大012---Yeah, it's a very large plane.
那就算了012---That's cool.
不过我们还是陪你一会012---But we'll stay here with you.
谢了012---Thanks, guys. Ha, ha.
我很感激你们的好意  但是你也不用摸我屁股啊012---I really appreciate this, you know, but you don't need to rub my butt.
我们一小时后就要回纽约了012---We have to leave for New York in an hour.
我知道  我一直在看那扇门012---I know. I've been looking at those doors.
隔音效果看起来很好  你觉得呢012---They look pretty soundproof, don't you think?
不行  你疯了012---We can't do that. That's insane.
第一  他可能醒来  第二012---I mean, A, he could wake up. And B, you know...
管他的012---...let's go for it.
艾蜜莉  艾蜜莉012---Emily? Emily.
艾蜜莉  不是她012---Emily! Nope.
不用找她了  她没跟来  我们来拿她的东西012---Forget about Emily. She's not with us. We've come for her things.
她在哪里012---Where is she?
她躲起来了  因为她很丢脸  这辈子都不想再见到你012---She's in hiding. She's utterly humiliated. She doesn't want to see you ever again.
很遗憾你们两个闹成这样  兔崽子012---We're very sad that it didn't work out between you and Emily, monkey.
不过我觉得你帅极了012---But I think you're absolutely delicious.
抱歉  我人还站在这里012---Excuse me, I'm standing right here.
是啊012---Oh, yes.
阴魂不散012---There you are.
大家动作快  外面还有一堆012---Hey. Hey, you guys. Hurry up. Get some. There's a whole cart outside.
再见了  盖勒  等下  等下012---Goodbye, Geller. Now, hold on. Hold on.
你女儿跟我012---Look, look. Your daughter and I...
今晚预定去度蜜月012---...are supposed to leave tonight for our honeymoon.
请你们转告她  我会去机场012---Now, you tell her that I'm gonna be at that airport...
我希望她也会去012---...and I hope that she'll be there too.
我是说成瑞秋的名字  但这只是无心之过012---Yeah, I said Rachel's name, but it didn't mean anything.
她不过是我的朋友  就这样  请转告艾蜜莉我爱她012---She's just a friend. That's all. Now, look, just tell Emily I love her...
我只想跟她共度余生012---...and that I can't imagine spending my life with anyone else.
请保证  你们一定会转告她012---Please, promise me that you'll tell her that.
好吧  我会告诉她012---All right, I'll tell her.
走吧  臭婆娘012---Come on, bugger face.
打电话给我012---Call me.
你也一天到晚的待在厕所012---You spend half your life in the bathroom.
怎么就不会从窗户滚蛋呢012---Why do you never go out the bloody window?
或许我们不再上床才对012---Well, maybe it's best we never got to do it again.
否则那晚就不会感觉特别了012---Yeah, it kind of makes that one night special.
理论上来讲  我们还在海外012---You know, technically, we still are over international waters.
我去洗手间  待会来找我012---I'm going to the bathroom. Maybe I'll see you there in a bit?
太棒了012---Okay.
我可以问个问题吗012---Hey, can I ask you something?
不行012---Uh, no.
我昨晚跟费丽西蒂  一起看《我的巨人》  我心想012---Felicity and I, we were watching My Giant. And I was thinking...
自己永远不可能  演得跟那个巨人一样棒012---...I'm never gonna be as good an actor as that giant.
你认为我想当演员  是不是只是痴心妄想012---Do you think I'm just wasting my life with this acting thing?
不是012---No.
那个巨人大概比我小五岁012---I mean, the giant's like five years younger than me.
我有办法跟他一样优秀吗012---You know, you think I'll ever get there?
会的012---Yes.
谢了  没问题012---Thanks, man. Okay, man.
但是他比我高好多啊012---But what about how much taller he is than me?
我现在已经不可能再长高了012---I mean, there's no way I can make myself taller now.
以后科学怎么发展  我不知道012---And who knows what science will come up with in the future...
如果我死时  只是一个身高平庸的小人物呢012---...but, Chandler, what if I die an unsuccessful, regular-size man?
摩妮卡  你厕所上了半个小时012---Hey, Monica. Wow, you've been in the bathroom for, like, a half-hour.
我知道012---I know.
你也吃了牛肉012---Had the beef tips, huh?
嗨012---Hey.
你吃过肉了012---You ate meat!
你跟人嘿咻012---You had sex!
我们才没有   我知道你没有012---No, we didn't. I know you didn't.
我说的是摩妮卡012---I was talking about Monica.
菲比  我才没跟人嘿咻012---Phoebe, I did not have sex.
怀孕害的我灵感不准012---Oh, this pregnancy is throwing me all off.
我要去跟小鸡小鸭打招呼  我跟你去012---I'm gonna say hi to the chick and duck. Oh, me too.
你何必去  你不是四天都去喂他们012---Why would you need to say hi? You've been feeding them for four days.
没错  我回家好了012---Oh, right. Maybe I'll just go home.
只剩下我们两个012---Well, we certainly are alone.
幸好我们说好回纽约就不做的012---Yes! Good thing we have that "not New York" rule.
没错012---Right.
既然你说到这个012---Um, listen, since we're on that subject...
我想告诉你012---...um, I just wanted to tell you that, um...
当时我在伦敦心情很不好012---Well, I was going through a really hard time in London...
因为哥哥结婚  别人还把我认作他妈012---...what with my brother getting married and that guy thinking I was Ross' mother.
我知道012---Right.
总而言之012---Well, anyway, I just...
那晚对我来说意义非凡  我的意思是  我要谢谢你012---That night meant a lot to me. And I guess I'm trying to say thanks.
这样012---Oh.
我那天也不是随便上床012---You know, that night meant a lot to me too.
并不是因为我心情不好012---And it wasn't because I was in a bad place or anything.
我很重视那晚是因为  你很性感012---It just meant a lot to me because you're really hot.
这样说可以吗  没关系012---Is that okay? Ha, ha. That's okay.
而且我也很帅012---And I'm cute too?
而且你也很帅  谢谢012---And you're cute too. Thank you.
我要去整理行李了  好012---All right, I got to go unpack. Okay.
再见012---Bye.
我时差还没调回来  这表示我还在伦敦吧012---I'm still on London time. Does that count?
没错  太好了012---Oh, that counts. Oh, good.
瑞秋012---Rach.
嗨012---Rach. Hi.
你怎么会在这里012---What are you doing here?
我在等候补机位回纽约012---Well, I've been on standby for a flight home for hours.
你还没等到艾蜜莉012---Oh. Oh. So no sign of Emily, huh?
还没012---Not yet.
那么012---So, um...
你是几点的飞机012---What time are you supposed to leave?
最后一次呼叫  前往雅典的1066班机012---This is the last call for Flight 1066 to Athens.
最后一次呼叫012---The last call.
就快了012---Pretty soon, I guess.
我很遗憾012---I'm sorry.
我不明白她怎么可以这么做012---I just... I don't understand. I mean, how could she do this?
我是不是白痴012---What, am I like a complete idiot...
竟然以为她会来012---...for thinking she'd actually show up?
不是012---No.
你不是白痴   罗斯012---You're not an idiot, Ross.
你只是爱得无可救药012---You're a guy very much in love.
那还不是一样012---Same difference.
搭乘1066班机  前往雅典的旅客请登机012---All passengers for Flight 1066 to Athens should now be onboard.
听到了012---I get it!
没戏了012---Well, that's that.
不  你知道什么啊012---No, you know what?
