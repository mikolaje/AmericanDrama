好了  选张卡  好012---Okay, Pick a card. Okay.
现在  记住花色号码012---All right. Now memorize it.
好了没  好了012---You got it? Oh, yes.
好  是这张吗012---Okay. Is that your card?
就是这张012---Yes. Ha, ha.
嘿  大家好  嗨012---Hey, guys. Hi there.
你们猜怎么着  班要上电视拍广告了012---Guess what. Ben is gonna be in a TV commercial.
你们在说什么  还没有定案012---What are you talking about? Well, it's not for sure.
不过  我们在公园里遇到一个人  他觉得班很可爱012---But, uh, we met this guy in the park who thought Ben was really cute.
当然  这也是事实啦012---You know, which he is.
所以那个人留了张名片  要我带班去参加广告试镜012---Um, anyhoo, he gave us his card and told us to bring him down for this commercial he's auditioning.
这个人是本地最大的选角导演012---Whoa.The guy's like the biggest commercial casting director in town.
班去公园随便散个步  就有试镜自动送上门012---Ben takes one lousy walk in the park and gets an audition?
我是说  班  真有你的012---I mean, way to go, Ben!
那个公园我都去烂了  却从来没人主动找我去试镜012---Man, I've been in that park a million times. No one's ever offered me an audition.
我知道  真的很神奇  我们只是在陪班玩荡秋千012---I know, it's crazy. We were just pushing Ben on the swings...
我每次都玩荡秋千啊012---I'm always on the swings.
我是哪里做错了012---What am I doing wrong?
就是荡秋千那里012---That.
老友记  第五季  第18集  瑞秋开始吸烟012---Friends  S05E18  The One Where Rachel Smokes
好  我要出门了  祝我好运  祝好运012---Okay, gotta go. Wish me luck. Good luck.
瑞秋  既然你在罗夫罗兰工作   能不能带几件马球衫回来012---Hey, Rach, now that you working at Ralph Lauren, can you bring me back some of those polo shirts?
什么啊  第一天上班就偷公司东西  我可能下不了手喔012---Uh, well, you know what? I don't know if I'd feel comfortable stealing on my very first day.
不愿意慷公司之慨012---Unwilling to steal from work.
有意思了012---Interesting.
当然  就算有人能拿免费的  那也非我莫属012---Besides, if anybody is gonna get free stuff, it's me.
好了  各位  祝我好运吧012---Okay, guys, way to wish me luck.
祝你好运  给他们好看012---Good luck! Go get 'em!
好了  来讨论帮瑞秋庆生的事012---Okay, let's discuss Rachel's birthday.
我建议在这周末搞个惊喜派对012---I say we throw a surprise party this weekend.
可是一个月后  才是她生日啊012---Whoa, whoa. But her birthday's not for another month.
是  没错  但在生日当天开派对  那就不惊喜啦012---Okay, but if we throw her a party on her birthday, then it's not a surprise.
我觉得这主意不错012---I think that's a great idea.
我们办个晚宴派对  邀请好朋友过来012---We can have a dinner party and invite her close friends.
罗斯  我们要帮瑞秋办惊喜派对喽012---Ross. We're having a surprise party for Rachel.
好  搞定012---Okay. Done.
好  那你要一起办吗  乐意之至012---Okay, great. So do you wanna do it together? I would love to do it together.
她们要一起来啦012---They're gonna do it together.
兄弟  那位可是我女友012---Dude, that's my girlfriend.
所以我就得闭嘴012---So I gotta shut it down now?
好  我得走了012---All right, I gotta take off. 
我要接班  然后去参加大试镜012---I'm picking up Ben and then we're off to the big audition.
看到有演员假装是班的父亲  那种感觉一定很怪012---It's gonna be weird to watch some actor pretending to be Ben's dad.
是啊  能怪过看到班的两个妈妈温存吗012---Yeah. Weirder than his two moms making out?
爸爸  广告里面有爸爸012---Whoa, whoa. Dad? There's a dad in the commercial?
是啊  班和爸爸喝汤  演得很陶醉的样子012---Yeah. The dad and Ben eat soup and pretend to enjoy it.
或许我可以跟你们一起去  搞不好能试镜演那个爸爸012---Well, maybe I'll go with you and see if I can audition as the dad.
说到扮演班的爸爸  由我这教父上场最适合了012---I mean, who better to play Ben's father than his godfather?
你不是班的教父  什么012---You're not his godfather. What?
你在开玩笑吧012---Are you kidding?
当然是啊012---Of course I am.
我们走吧  教父  好啊012---Okay, let's go, godfather. All right. Ha, ha.
嘿  我通过了  他们让我试镜012---Hey, I'm in. They're gonna let me audition.
真的  太棒了012---Really? That's great.
我知道  有个女的看过我演的舞台剧  所以我离她离得远远的012---I know, I know. One of the casting ladies has actually seen me in a play. So I steered clear of her.
那个孩子看起来很眼熟012---That kid looks familiar.
是啊  他拍过一堆广告012---Yeah, he's done tons of commercials.
有糖果广告  新力游戏机012---I've seen him in Sugar Smacks, PlayStation...
还帮电话公司拍过广告012---...and that one for the phone company.
他演得实在是太好了  我索性跟着换了电话公司012---In fact, he was so good in that one. He actually convinced me to switch phone companies.
钱德因此还气得半死012---Chandler was mad.
不过  他这次休想拿到这角色  因为班比他可爱多了012---Yeah, well, he's not gonna get this one. All right? Ben is way cuter than that kid.
看就知道  宝贝  看看你012---I mean, look at him.
很好  不过若我能演班的爸爸  这样是不是很棒012---That's great. Listen, wouldn't it be great if I got to play Ben's dad?
乔伊  你跟班一点都不像012---Joey, you look nothing like Ben.
比你跟他像多了012---I look more like him than you do.
我跟你还不熟  哪里生得出小孩012---Well, I really don't know you well enough for you to do that.
现在是最后的二选一012---So it's down to these two.
南西  我知道你喜欢这一个  我也有同感012---Nancy, I know you like this one and I think I agree.
瑞秋  你觉得呢012---Rachel, what do you think?
那个是很漂亮012---Well, um, that one is pretty...
但我更喜欢这个的质感  抱歉了012---...but I just love this fabric. Sorry.
不用抱歉  你的职责之一就是多出好点子012---Oh, don't be sorry. That's part of your job here, to give your opinions.
功劳归我  开玩笑的012---And then I take credit for them. I'm kidding. Ha, ha.
她这次是在开玩笑  下次别再跟她有不同意见了012---She is kidding. But don't ever disagree with her again.
这次换我在开玩笑012---Okay, now I'm kidding. Oh, ha, ha.
真是有趣的办公室012---Oh, what a fun office.
我不知道要选哪一个  不过先来根烟倒是真的012---I don't know which one. But I do know I need a cigarette.
不如我们出去休息一下  等回来之后再解决012---So, what do you say we take a break, go outside and figure this out when we come back.
瑞秋  嗯012---Rachel?  Yeah.
你抽烟吗  不抽012---You smoke? No.
我爸是医生  老跟我说些恐怖的故事012---My dad's a doctor. And he would always tell me just horror stories...
说那些鬼神精灵的012---About ghosts and goblins...
完全赞同公主抽烟的权利012---...who totally supported the princess' right to smoke.
她们在抽烟的时候  就背着我做出了决定012---And then they came back from smoking and they'd made all of the decisions without me.
这样不太公平  我知道啊012---That doesn't seem fair. I know.
我不同流合污还被处罚  抽烟可是恶心又伤身的习惯012---It's like I'm being punished for not having this disgusting, poisonous habit.
对  抽烟最棒了012---Yeah, it is the best.
万一  这种事没完没了怎么办012---I mean, what if this keeps happening?
她们在外头抽烟做决定012---Y'know, they'll-they'll be outside smoking, making all the decisions...
我只能在办公室里  呼吸愚蠢的新鲜空气012---...and I'll just be up in my office breathing in my stupid clean air.
到时候等阿金要升我们的职  你们想她会选谁012---You know? And then when the day comes when Kim wants to promote one of us,who do you think she's gonna pick?
  是我还是乌烟瘴气的冒烟女012---Me or Smokey Smokerson?
瑞秋  你也可以一起去  不用抽烟  就说要去透透气012---Rachel, you can go down there, you don't have to smoke.Just say you wanna get some fresh air.
对  这我做得到012---Yeah, I could do that.
简单一点的就是  一起抽烟012---Yeah, or you could just do the easy thing and smoke.
嘿  瑞秋  要去喝咖啡吗  嘿012---Hey. Rachel，Do you wanna go get coffee? Hey.
乐意之至  好012---Oh, I would love to. Oh, good.
宝贝  我也想起去  好啊012---I'm gonna go too, babe. Oh, good.
等等  我变卦了012---Oh, I changed my mind.
好  来讨论派对的事  我有一大堆点子012---Okay, let's talk about the party. I have so many ideas.
我也是012---Ooh, me too. Oh!
耶  真是壮观啊012---Yeah! Oh, look at that.
好  这是蛋糕的素描图012---All right. This is a little sketch of the cake. Uh-huh. Wow.
还有一些菜单的样本012---See? Um, some sample menus.
不如用异国小点心当餐前菜012---Um, you know, I thought we'd start with a Tuscan-style finger food.
至于音乐嘛  这是我收藏的CD的字母列表012---Okay. And for music, here's an alphabetized list of all of my CDs.
跟食物超级搭配的还都做了记号012---I've highlighted the ones that'll go really good with the food.
不是说要亲密的晚餐派对吗  现在不那样做了012---What happened to the intimate dinner party? Oh, we're not doing that.
好  那么  好012---Okay? So... Wow. All right.
看来你全包办了  多谢"共同"主办人012---Looks like you took care of everything. Thanks a lot, cohost.
怎么了  我没有一手包办啊  你要做的事还有很多012---Wait. I didn't take care of everything.there's-there's plenty of things for you to do!
举个例子012---Uh-huh? Like what?
杯子012---Cups.
杯子  你让我准备杯子012---Cups. You're giving me cups?
还有冰块012---And ice.
杯子和冰块  我可以负责杯子和冰块012---Cups and ice? Oh, I get to be in charge of cups and ice?
好吧012---All right.
行  我就负责杯子和冰块012---Fine. Okay, I will be in charge of cups and ice.
等等  冰块可以从餐厅拿012---Wait, I can get ice at the restaurant...
冰块是我的012---I got it! Mine!
嗨  嘿012---Hi. Hey.
试镜顺利吗  不太顺利012---How did the audition go? Not so good.
慢着  你在学乔伊那招吗012---Wait a minute. Are you doing Joey's:
“试镜不太顺利" 012---"The audition didn't go so well."
事实上  很顺利对吧012---Yeah, it did!
没错012---Yeah, I am!
班取得了第二次试镜的资格  太好了012---Yeah, Ben got a second audition. Oh, great.
对  是我让罗斯那样沮丧的  因为我没有过关012---Yeah, I had to teach Ross my bit because I actually didn't get a callback.
你也过关了  对吧012---You got a callback too, didn't you?
没错012---Yeah, I did!
瑞秋  你怎么会来这里012---Hey, Rachel. What are you doing out here?
里头有点无聊  我就想来这里透透新鲜空气012---You know, it got kind of lonely up there, so I just thought I would come out here and get some fresh air.
南西和我正好讨论到秋装  太好了012---We were talking about the fall collection. Oh, great.
所以  这是要012---So anyway, we really...
抱歉  瞧你被我们熏的  没关系012---I'm sorry. We're smoking all over you. That's okay.
不  不  你待着  我们走012---No, no, no. We'll move. You stay there.
总之我把设计寄给罗夫  他很喜欢012---I sent the designs to Ralph. He was excited about it.
太好了  你是最棒的012---That's great. You are the best.
不好意思  能借支烟吗012---Excuse me. Can I bum one of those?
这个就好012---Y'know what, actually this one's...
你们在聊什么好笑的012---Okay, okay, okay. What's so funny over here?
我还以为你不抽烟的012---I thought you didn't smoke.
我以为你们是说抽大麻烟012---You know, I thought you guys meant marijuana cigarettes.
知道我的意思吗  像瘾君子那样012---You know what I mean? Like, doobies?
事实上  我还纳闷儿  "你们是疯了不成"012---Actually, I thought to myself, "Those guys are crazy."
没有啦  其实  普通香烟我一直爱抽012---But no, actually, I smoke the regular ones all the time.
我们会抽大麻012---We get high.
我也是012---Me too.
我说笑的012---I'm kidding. Oh!
我也是012---Me too.
老天  这真是折磨人  你是怎么习惯的012---Oh, God. This is so nerve-racking. How do you do this?
我过关的经验不多  所以012---Well, fortunately, I don't get many callbacks so...
我们在试镜之后被留下来  这是好现象吗012---Is it a good sign that they asked us to hang around after the audition?
天知道012---Who knows?
最后入围的是雷蒙  班  凯尔和乔伊012---Okay. We have narrowed it down to Raymond, Ben, Kyle and Joey.
其余的人辛苦了  谢谢012---The rest of you, thank you very much.
好呀  我就知道012---Yes! I knew it!
再见012---Ah. Bye-bye.
再会012---So long.
后会有期012---Later.
太棒了  我有可能饰演班的爸爸012---This is great. I might actually get to play Ben's dad.
其实  那是不可能的012---Actually, that can't happen.
因为你们各自的长相都不同012---Because you all have such different looks...
所以我们把你和雷蒙配对  凯尔和班是一组012---...we're putting you with Raymond and Kyle with Ben.
所以最后只有一组会出线012---So it'll either be you two or you two.
要命012---Oh, man.
这样就有点尴尬了  真的是012---This is gonna be kind of weird. Yeah, it is.
对  一定会很尴尬012---Yeah. It's gonna be weird.
因为我们是最好的朋友  所以才会尴尬012---No. We're like best friends. That's why it's weird.
原来如此  我只是搭腔而已012---I thought we were just talking.
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
我能把这些东西放这里  等着给瑞秋过生日吗012---Is it okay if I leave this stuff here till Rachel's birthday party?
当然可以  里头是什么  杯子012---Uh, sure. What's in them? Um, cups.
那好  因为我们替瑞秋  准备了八百加仑的水012---Oh, good, because we got Rachel 800 gallons of water.
老实说  这些杯子还真不少012---Seriously, that's a lot of cups.
对  这是因为我负责杯子和冰块012---Yeah, well, that's 'cause in charge of cups and ice,
摩妮卡在这一天将后悔莫及  因为她要我负责杯子和冰块012---And Monica's gonna rue the day that she put me in charge of cups and ice.
我也后悔过一次  除了后悔没做别的012---You know, I rued the day once. Didn't get a whole lot else done.
好吧  该把其他杯子搬上来了012---Okay, time to bring up the rest of the cups.
嘿  乔伊  嘿  菲比012---Hey, Joey. Hey, Pheebs.
嘿  罗斯  你在这里正好012---Hey. Ross, good, I'm glad you're here.
我有事要跟你说  怎么了012---I want to talk to you about something. Oh. What's up?
我一直在想这次拍广告的事012---Well, I've been thinking about this whole commercial thing.
我和班硬碰硬  捉对厮杀012---You know me against Ben. The two of us competing.
这样比怎么都不会有好结果  所以012---Well, that can't lead to anything good. So, 
我想我还是退出好了  告诉他们我不去试镜012---I think I'm just gonna step aside. I'm gonna tell them that I won't audition.
乔伊  太好了  多谢012---Wow. Uh...Joey, that's great. Thanks, man.
就这样012---That's it?
你真的要让我这样做  这事关我的职业生涯啊012---You're gonna let me do this? This is my career we're talking about here.
可是你说  我是要你说出让班退出012---But you just I just said that so you wouldn't let Ben do it.
罗斯  如果真有人要退出  那也应该是班012---Look, Ross, if anyone should step aside, it should be Ben.
什么  钱德  告诉他为什么012---What? Chandler, tell him.
我先去开门012---Well, let me get the door first.
没有人  你好012---Oh, hi, no one.
为什么班应该退出012---Why should Ben step aside?
这原本就是他的试镜012---It was his audition in the first place.
你是跟过去的  就像是跟班老爹012---You just tagged along. You're like the tag-along dad.
起码我有顾虑到班的感受012---At least I care about his feelings.
什么012---What?
你知道万一他没通过试镜  到时他会有多难过吗012---Do you know how hard this is gonna be on him when he doesn't get it?
那他又为什么不会通过012---And why wouldn't he get it?
得了吧  你有没有看过  跟我同组的小子有多厉害012---Oh, come on.Have you seen what my kid can do? Huh?
他会拨电话  吃墨西哥脆片012---I mean, he dials phones, he eats tortilla chips.
还会凭空踢足球演对手戏呢012---He plays soccer with the cartoon tiger.
你是说你的那个小子能喝汤  比我儿子厉害012---Are you saying your kid eats soup better than my kid?
你只是给他一根汤匙罢了012---You just give him a spoon, baby.
是吗  我们走着瞧  好啊012---Oh, yeah? I guess we'll see. Yeah.
这支广告片的主角  非我和米契莫属012---Because this commercial belongs to me and Mitch.
你的孩子叫做雷蒙  对  你的也是012---Your kid's name is Raymond. Yeah? So is yours.
有没有用  很棒012---How did work go? Oh, it was great. It was great.
我听你们的建议  去她们抽烟的地方012---I went down there just like you said.
我们讨论到了生意  阿金完全接受我的意见012---And we talked business. And Kim totally took my opinions.
你浑身烟味012---You stink.
多谢  我是说真的012---Thanks. No, I'm serious.
因为那里的人全都在抽烟012---That's because I went down there and they were smoking.
这其实是成功的味道012---This is actually the smell of success.
不过有点怪怪的  天啊  你有抽烟012---But there's something different, though.Oh, my God. You smoked.
我没有  才怪012---I did not. Yes, you did.
你看起来像又生病又快乐  你一定有抽烟012---You look happy and sick. You smoked.
好啦  我是有抽  为了事业不得已嘛012---All right, fine. But I had to. I had to do it for my career.
真希望我也可以  为了事业这么做012---I wish I had to smoke for my career.
这样很恶心啊012---That's so gross.
没那么糟吧012---Well, no, it's not that bad, you know?
虽然舌头有点打结  手指也有点怪味012---I mean, yeah, my tongue feels a little fuzzy and my fingers sort of smell.
其实我感觉快吐了012---I actually feel like I could throw up.
好  但你一定要撑过这一关  再来就会是快乐无比了012---But you gotta push past this, okay? Because it's about to get so good.
钱德012---Chandler.
我给你说  你浑身的烟味  我得出去透透气了012---I have to tell you, you smell so smoky, I have to get up.
我没骗你012---I'm not kidding.
我觉得你闻起来很香012---I think you smell great.
所以大家都同意了  不要格子图案  要粉红012---So we're decided. No on plaid, yes on pink.
完全正确012---Absolutely.
我举双手双脚赞成012---I'm so onboard.
瑞秋   这支烟不是才刚点吗012---Rachel, didn't you just light that?
是啊  但是你知道吗  我正在努力少抽烟012---Yeah. But you know what? I'm just really, really trying to cut back, you know.
瑞秋  我等着看笑话012---Good luck, Rach.
其实我最近有想要戒烟012---I've actually been thinking about quitting.
我每周日晚上  都告诉自己要戒烟012---Oh, well, sure. Every Sunday night, I tell myself I'm quitting.
结果周一还不是狂抽猛抽012---Every Monday morning, it's like:
还用你说012---Tell me about it.
那就戒了吧  我们一起戒烟012---Well, let's quit. We'll just quit. Let's all quit.
听起来是很诱人啦012---It does sound appealing.
我戒烟从没成功过  你可以的  一定行012---I never could do it. But you could. You can. Absolutely.
我们可以互相帮忙012---We can help each other out.
用那个什么戒烟贴布的  我们能组成戒烟三姊妹012---We could get those patches. We could be like the Patch Sisters.
其实我们真的应该戒烟  好吧  一起来戒烟012---You know, we really should quit. Okay, let's quit.
好  太棒了  把香烟给我  来  通通交出来012---Yes. Great. Give me those cigs. Come on. Give it. Give it. Out. Done. Quit. Whoo!
那个打火机是我前夫送我的012---My late husband gave me that lighter.
我没在开玩笑012---I'm not kidding.
那好吧012---Okay, then. Okay.
汤012---Mm, soup.
汤012---Mm, soup.
汤012---Mm, soup.
乔伊  罗斯随时会到012---Joey, Ross is gonna be here any second.
我去上个厕所  帮我看一下班  好吗012---would you mind watching Ben for me while I use the ladies' room?
好啊  没问题  谢谢012---Yeah, no problem. Thanks.
嗨  班012---Hi, Ben.
你想当演员啊012---So you want to be an actor, huh?
告诉你  演戏可不像野餐012---Well, I gotta tell you, it's no picnic.
有碰不完的钉子012---There's tons of rejection.
一点都不稳定012---No stability.
前一天  你还是德瑞克医生012---I mean, one day, you're Dr. Drake Ramoray.
隔天  你就要去啃蕃茄酱012---The next day, you're eating ketchup right out of the bottle.
乔伊012---Joey.
罗斯012---Ross.
班012---Ben.
班  班012---I mean, Ben. Ben.
雷蒙   乔伊  该你们上场了012---Okay, Raymond, Joey, you're up.
嗨  好012---Hi. Okay.
好吧  我们来试一次  你们准备好了就开始012---All right, well, let's try one. Whenever you guys are ready.
有问题吗012---Uh-oh. Is there a problem?
这是面汤  我练习时是用蕃茄汤012---Well, this is noodle soup. And I've been working with tomato.
不过还好了  没关系  没关系012---But that's okay. No problem. No problem.
面汤012---Mm, noodle soup.
你那样不错  不过台词是 "汤"012---You know, that's fine. But the line is, "Mm, soup."
那我刚才说什么  面汤012---Oh. What'd I say? Mm, noodle soup.
有什么不一样012---How's that different?
对012---Oh. Right. Yeah.
好  我们来试一次012---All right. Let's try one.
面汤012---Mm, noodle soup.

汤  我是说  是"面汤"  不对  "汤"012---Mm, soup.I mean, noodle soup. I mean, soup.
你争气点012---Come on!
我们得换下一组了012---You know what? We need to move on.
不  我再演一次  你看012---Oh, no, I could do it one more time.See, look.
面汤012---Mm, noodle soup.
可恶012---Damn it.
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
被逮到了012---Uh-oh. Busted.
你们这是在干嘛  我们不是戒烟姊妹花吗012---Come on, you guys. What are you doing? I thought we were the Patch Sisters.
对  可是那样行不通012---Yeah, that didn't work out.
瑞秋  我们想尝试着戒烟  但实在是太难了012---Rachel, we tried to quit. But it was too hard.
你们开始抽烟  起码也该告诉我一声嘛012---Well, y'know, if you started smoking again, you could have at least told me.
拜托  快给我来支  刚才说到哪里012---Come on, give me one of those. What are we talking about?
不行  你戒烟很成功  不许放弃012---No, you're doing great. Don't give up.
所以我们才没跟你说  我们不想拖你下水012---That's why we didn't tell you, and we are not gonna drag you down with us.
等等  别这样  拖我下水012---Oh, wait. No, no. Drag me down. Drag me down.
瑞秋  千万不行  你戒烟成功  我们都替你骄傲012---Forget it, Rachel. We're both so proud of how well you're doing.
我不能让你前功尽弃012---I'm not gonna let you blow it.
若被我查到你有带烟  我一定炒你鱿鱼012---In fact, if I catch you, you're fired.
走吧  离开这里  走啊  我不要你吸二手烟  走啊012---So go on, get out of here. Go on. I don't want you breathing this stuff. Go on.
那好  你和我一起去法国出差012---So okay. So you'll come with me on the Paris trip?
要命012---Oh, man.
你瞧瞧  杯子帽  杯子布条012---Hey, check it out. Cup hat, cup banner...
杯子吊灯  还有本尊  杯子012---...cup chandelier and the thing that started it all. The cup.
菲比  你对杯子还真有一套012---Great job with the cups, Pheebs. Ha, ha.
你干脆跟她去约会算了012---Why don't you just go out with her?
你有没有注意到冰012---Did you notice the ice? Look.
各式各样的都有  有碎冰  冰块还有干冰  注意看012---We have it all. We have crushed, cubed and dry. Watch.
很有神秘感吧012---Mystical.
没人想吃我的小点心  他们全跑去吃菲比的雪花冰012---Everyone--no one's eating my Tuscan finger food 'cause they're all filling up on Phoebe's snow cones!
有雪花冰012---There are snow cones?
雪花冰  最恶心了012---Snow cones. Yuck.
你去吃啦  谢谢012---Y'know…go! Go! Right there!  Thank you.
注意  惊喜012---Look, look. Surprise.
什么啊  一个月后才是我生日啊012---What? My birthday is not for another month.
这样才有惊喜啊012---That's the surprise.
天啊  你们太棒了012---Oh, my God, you guys. This is so great.
我完全没想到  钱德的生日还比我早到呢012---It's so unexpected.I mean, Chandler's birthday's even before mine.
惊喜012---Surprise.
真是太棒了  看看这些012---Wow. This is so great. Look at all these...
杯子  真的是怪怪的012---...cups. This is so weird.
杯子是我负责的012---I was in charge of cups.
好  那就没那么怪了012---Oh, okay. Not so weird.
嘿  嘿012---Hey. Hey.
我很遗憾  你试镜不顺利012---Listen, man. I'm sorry the audition didn't go well.
是喔012---Yeah, right.
不  乔伊  我是真的很遗憾012---No, really. I am, Joey. I feel bad.
罗斯  你用不着遗憾012---Well, look, Ross. You don't have to, okay?
是我自己太差  怨不得你012---It's not your fault I suck.
连〝面汤"都说不好  还算哪门子的演员012---What kind of an actor can't even say, "Mm, noodle soup"?
你知道吗  或许你搞砸了试镜  不是因为你差012---Hey, you know what? Maybe you didn't mess up your audition because you suck.
或许你演砸了试镜  是因为你更在意你的"教子"012---Maybe you messed up because you care more about your godson.
什么意思  我认为  在潜意识里012---What do you mean? I think, subconsciously...
等等  我听不懂012---Whoa, you lost me.
我是觉得在某种程度上012---I think, on some level,
你故意演砸了自己的试镜012---you sabotaged your own audition
是为了让班拿到那个角色012---so Ben would get the part.
你的说法让我感觉舒服多了012---Well, your way sounds a lot better than mine.
对012---Yeah.
对啊  不是我演技烂  不是012---Yeah. It's not that I'm a bad actor. No.
只是我  太关心小班的成长了012---No, it's just that, uh, I care so damn much about little Ben...
看到他成功  对我来说更重要012---...that, uh, it was more important for me to see him succeed.
就是这样  谢谢你  谢谢你012---There you go. Thank you. Thank you.
那他拿到角色没  没有012---So did he get it? No.
那确实没办法了012---Ah, what are you gonna do?
不好意思  瑞秋葛林在吗  我跟她约了吃中饭012---Oh, hi. Excuse me. Is Rachel Green here? I'm supposed to meet her for lunch.
她现在不会来这里了  请到10楼找她012---Oh, she doesn't come down anymore. You can find her up on 10.
好012---Okay, great.
我们昨天中饭聊到提案报告  他担心一个人出差不够看012---So we talked about the  whole presentation yesterday at lunch and he wondered if one person would be enough  to get a take on the trip
我说 "绝对没问题"012---And I said, "Yeah, absolutely."
后会有期了012---I'll catch you guys later.
