Previously on Desperate Housewives...
Victor made himself
perfectly clear...
Whenever I've truly
wanted something,
I've always gotten it.
Bree needed to get away...
We're finally taking
our honeymoon.
Susan couldn't wait
to pop the question...
Will you marry me?
Lynette received
shocking news...
You can see this.
It could be lymphoma.
Why are you so reluctant to
make a commitment to me?
Because I'm not
in love with you.
And Edie...
What if we tried
to have a baby?
Engaged in
a dangerous deception.
When Gabrielle Solis agreed
to marry Victor Lang,
she was determined to have
a very traditional wedding.
She was even more determined
to be a very traditional bride.
To that end, the handkerchief
in her cleavage was borrowed,
the garter on
her leg was blue,
and the diamonds on
her ears were old.
But sadly for Gabrielle,
something was missing,
and she was about to
throw a traditional fit.
It is after 3:00!
Where the hell is Bree
with my "something new"?!
I know her plane landed on time.
She'll probably be here any second.
God, I should have my head
examined for even agreeing to this.
Who the hell cares about
Swiss jewelry anyway?
Gaby, Bree went out of her way
to buy you that bracelet.
And, of course, it's the
hottest day of the year.
All the guests are out
there sweating like pigs.
God, at this rate,
my reception's gonna look like the
finish line of the Boston marathon.
If you're that freaked out,
just get married without the bracelet.
Are you out of your mind?!
I can't get married without
my "something new. "
I have an idea.
I just got a lipstick yesterday.
You could wear that.
I just paid a makeup artist
500 bucks to do my face.
Do you really think I wanna march down
the aisle looking like just ate a popsicle?
Okay, it's your big day,
so I'm gonna let that slide.
God, it is 10 after,
and Bree is never late!
Where can she be?
All right, that's it.
After I finish "tszujing" my hair,
tell the preacher it's showtime.
I can't believe my wedding's already
ruined, and it hasn't even started.
Hey, I'm starting to get
worried about Bree.
Maybe we should call.
Yeah. I'm calling her cell.
It's ringing.
Oh, good.
Bree!
Hello, ladies.
Is that Bree? She better not
have come empty-handed!
Oh, I didn't.
As promised, Bree had arrived
with something new.
Holy crap!
And she also...
brought the bracelet.

Family.
There is nothing
more important.
They're the ones we want to laugh
with during the good times...
and the ones we need to
console us during the bad.
And even though the time comes
when they have to leave us,
their voices still linger
in our minds.
And sometimes
we can't help but listen.
A tangled web,
that's what you're weaving.
Beat it, mother.
You really think this little scheme
of yours is gonna work?
Of course it will.
Look at him. He's...
practically in love
with me already.
That's because he thinks
you're gonna give him a baby.
Wait till he finds out
you're still on the pill.
Shut up, would you?!
I just thank the good Lord your
father didn't live to see this.
Well, neither did you.
You died alone in a trailer park
watching game shows.
And why should
I listen to you?
'Cause I know what's
waiting for you, missy.
This one's gonna leave
you like all the others.
You're going to end up old
and alone, just like I did.
Carlos?
Carlos!
Down here, babe!
I'm making you
a fruit smoothie.
Chicken or fish?
What?
I haven't gotten your reply card
back yet. So chicken or fish?
Oh! Right,
your wedding.
I can't go.
Why not?
I'm a jinx.
I went to your last wedding,
and look how that turned out.
Come on, Gaby. We both
know it'd be weird if I went.
Okay, maybe a little, but
it'll be weirder if you don't.
Excuse me?
Look, everyone knows
you're living with Edie.
If she shows up alone, people will
think I asked her not to bring you,
like it bugs me that
you guys are together.
But it does bug you.
You hit the roof when you found out.
Which is why I have to show
people that I'm okay with it.
Please, just consider it
my wedding gift.
Okay, but I'm skipping
the ceremony.
What?!
And just go to the reception?
You can't do that.
I don't want
to make a scene.
You'll vow,
"till death do us part,"
I'll bust out laughing,
people will stare...
Reception starts at 4:00.
I'm thinking a chocolate fountain
would be a cool centerpiece
to a dessert buffet.
Dessert buffet?
We're having
a wedding cake, right?
Isn't that dessert?
Yeah, but you have to
give people a choice.
Don't you think a chocolate
fountain would be elegant?
I don't know. You, a big white
dress, melted chocolate.
Am I the only one
hearing alarm bells?
Fine, we'll skip
the chocolate.
How about a champagne
fountain? Oh, I know!
Maybe we can make the champagne
flow through the ice sculpture.
Don't you think we might be
going a little over-the-top?
Mike, these are all fairly
standard wedding features.
Now you name one thing that
you think is going over-the-top.
How about the dove wrangler?
Well, the doves are not going
to release themselves.
Do we really need 40 of 'em?
Okay, I know that
you think I'm being silly,
but all of our friends went to Bree's
wedding, and now they're going to Gaby's.
Two months from now, do we really
want them thinking our wasn't as nice?
It seems to me our friends wouldn't
be there to make petty comparisons.
They'd be there to
celebrate our love.
You would think
that, but no.
Come on.
This is something that we have
both looked forward to for so long.
Don't you want it
to be perfect?
Oh, I guess.
About the doves, though...
What?
You in a wedding gown,
40 birds circling overhead?
Again, not liking
those odds.
It's not as bad
as it sounds.
It's Hodgkin's lymphoma,
and apparently,
if you're going to get lymphoma,
that's the kind you want.
Hey, you wanna hold it
down up there, kids?
I'm trying to talk to
your aunt Lucy!
Thank you!
Anyway, I know I said that we would
come and visit you this June,
but I'll be a little woozy and...
bald from the chemo, so...
Thanks for understanding.
Oh, one more thing.
Our insurance policy has
a really high deductible,
so we are strapped financially,
and I was wondering if maybe
you and Dave might be able to...
Oh, really?
No, I am not asking Mom.
She doesn't know about any of this,
so don't you tell her, okay?
We'll be fine.
I love you.
Bye.
I take it that's a "no"
on the loan?
Yep.
Dave lost his job
at the plant,
and he is now handing out flyers
at a chicken restaurant, and...
prepare to wince,
there is a chicken suit involved.
So where are we gonna
find this $10, 000?
You leave that to me.
I want you to focus
on getting better.
But, honey...
I will find it.
Meanwhile, we'll make some
sacrifices around here.
My tennis club membership
is up this month.
I'm not renewing.
Should you even be playing
tennis after your back surgery?
Probably not.
Well, in that spirit,
as soon as I start chemo,
I will be giving up shampoo.
Okay, thanks.
Taxi's here.
Are you sure you're
ready to go back?
We could wait
another week.
And miss Gaby's wedding?
No, I'll be fine.
Is this the dress you were
thinking for the ceremony?
Yes.
Oh, good.
I'll fold it in tissue
so it doesn't wrinkle.
Oh, darling,
I don't deserve you.
Oh, come on.
We agreed, no more tears.
I'm so sorry to be
putting you through this.
I wouldn't blame you if you ran
like hell and never looked back.
Stop.
I'm going to raise this child and
love it as if it were my own.
Now let's see a smile.
Well, I'm glad you
could join us, Milton.
It's good to get to know
you before the wedding.
Thank you.
You know, I must say,
all these months, I thought Victor
was exaggerating about you.
But he hasn't
done you justice.
You, my dear,
are a flawless beauty.
I'm hardly flawless.
I'm sure I have a blemish
hidden away somewhere.
Now that's a search
I would relish.
She is way out of
your league, Dad.
Honey, he's a multimillionaire.
He runs my league.
By the way, Victor, I...
ran into Keith
Perkinson last week.
And how is the venerable
state chairman?
Impressed with you.
He liked the way you ran
your mayor campaign,
said if you keep
your numbers up,
he might consider supporting
you in the next governor's race.
Really?
What's so funny?
You gotta be kidding, right?
I mean, we just
finished a campaign.
You're not about to put
me through another one.
But I thought
you loved campaigning.
God, no.
It's a complete snore.
Pasting a smile on my face while you
say the same speech for the 50th time?
But you were a natural.
People loved you.
Well, the feeling
wasn't mutual.
You think I enjoyed
sipping tea with these
frumpy matrons who wore
loud, polyblend pantsuits?
You know how many times
I just wanted to scream,
"Vote for my husband,
you color-blind cow!"?
I think you've discovered something very
important about democracy, my dear.
The nation is full of fools,
and everyone gets a vote.
Well, they're not
gonna get us again.
I made nice with Fairview.
I'm not about to suck up
to the whole damn state.
What are you doing?
Some guy out in Mount Pleasant's
got a cracked water heater.
It's 3:00 in the morning.
Well, I started advertising
as a 24-hour plumber.
After midnight,
I get triple time.
Okay, well, that's crazy.
You can't work round
the clock. It's not healthy.
Well, this is the third night
I've worked this week.
I'm fine so far.
You've been sneaking out
while I've been asleep?
What are you,
ninja plumber?
It's just for a little while,
earn some extra money.
Is this about the wedding?
We agreed we want it
to be nice.
But we didn't
agree on this.
Maybe I can scale
things back a bit.
How?
Have a ginger ale fountain?
Make paper doves
and hope it's windy?
Okay, seriously, you don't
have to kill yourself.
I could max out
my credit card.
Is that really how you want to
start our life together, in debt?
No, I wanna start out happy.
But clearly, you're upset,
and I don't know why.
I'm not Ian.
I can't afford to move
you into a mansion,
or fly you off to Paris,
but I'll be damned
if I don't give you
the same dream wedding
he would have given you.
I'll see you
in the morning.
I'm drawing pictures of trees.
Where the hell do you
get off having cancer
and not telling
me about it?!
Mom...
How do you think you could
handle this without me?
Stella?
Oh, there's my Tommy boy!
Come here!
God.
Listen, be a love, will you, honey,
and get my bags from the cab?
Bags?
She's staying?
Yep.
And do not tip the driver.
S.O.B. wouldn't
let me smoke.
Jeez, Lynette, I didn't know
you opened a day care center.
Hey, kids, Grandma's here.
Okay, what did you
tell them about me?
It's been five years, Mom.
They don't remember you.
Well, they'll remember me
this time. I brought presents.
Cool!
Hey...
For you,
and you,
and you.
These are baby toys.
We're too old
to play with these.
Well, I'm too old to remember what
the hell 6-year-olds like to play with.
We're 8.
What do I care?
Just say thank you.
Thank you.
Who's the pretty thing?
Your girlfriend?
No!
She's my sister!
Is that Tom's
little B-A-S-T-A...
Okay, kids, time to get your
toys and let's play upstairs.
Come on, Penny.
Come on, sweetie.
Let's go, everybody.
Listen, Mom, I really
appreciate you coming to help,
but as you can see,
I'm perfectly fine.
For now.
Now how you gonna handle that mob
when you're flat on your ass from chemo?
I'll manage.
You got through breast cancer
while raising the three of us alone.
I was not alone.
I had you.
Lynette was all of 13, and she
still looked after her sisters,
cleaned the house,
cooked the meals,
and I was curled up in a ball,
puking my guts out.
Well, that's what you get when
you mix chemo and vodka gimlets.
You can goad me
all you like, Lynette.
I did not come
here to fight.
Now trust me, cookie,
I have memorized the
whole catalog of subjects
you and I can
no longer discuss,
and if that means that we have
to talk about the weather
for three months, then fine.
But I am staying.
Now...
If you'll excuse me, I have to go
kick a child out of its room.
Okay.
Legs up!
You wanna do it again?
No.
I've been doing
a lot of research,
and gravity helps facilitate
the sperm reaching the eggs.
So...
Heave-ho!
Well, could we try
a little light spooning
before you hang me up
like a side of beef?
Edie, we're trying
to have a baby.
Well, could we be
a little less clinical?
Maybe let nature
take its course?
Nature is not on
our side anymore.
Look, you're no
spring chicken,
and those eggs aren't
exactly farm-fresh.
Okay, stop referring
to me as poultry.
Sorry.
Can we just try this?
It's only for 30 minutes.
30 minutes?!
I am not staying in this
position for a half an hour.
Listen, I know that this
requires some work,
but it will all be worth it when we
have our beautiful, beautiful baby.
Right?
Right.
I guess I could...
make some sacrifices.
That's my girl.
Can I get you anything?
Yeah. I'd kill for a beer.
Sorry. No alcohol.
What?! For how long?
Just until the baby's born.
Oh, and you stop nursing.
Don't worry. I'll get you
a nice herbal tea.
It's just for a few months
while you're in treatment.
We're gonna have to find
someone to watch the kids.
No!
I am not leaving that woman
in charge of our children.
In three months, the twins
will be chain-smoking, and
Penny will be an alcoholic.
We can manage.
We've got McCluskey.
She costs money.
Money that we won't have
if we're paying someone
to replace you at work.
You said not to worry about money,
that you'd find it somewhere.
I did.
What, someone
loaned us $10, 000?
No, gave us,
and we can't thank her
by kicking her out.
No! Tom, you didn't
ask my mother?!
Didn't have to.
She knew that you hit up
Lucy, so she offered.
Well, we're giving it back.
No, we can't afford to.
Tom, you don't know half
the stuff she did to us.
She would get drunk
and smack us around.
She would meet some new
guy and then drop us off
at her sister's for a week
because he wasn't into kids.
So she was a crappy Mom.
You said yourself
that she has mellowed.
Now she wants
to make amends.
If you would just
try to understand...
I think that I've been
pretty understanding lately.
What's that supposed to mean?
I think you know.
Great, so in the middle of
everything I'm dealing with,
you're gonna throw
Rick in my face.
When someone we love hurts us,
if we still love them,
we deal with it
and we move on.
If I can do it,
so can you.
So forgiving my mother...
that's my penance?
Yeah.
I think it is.
I thought you said we weren't supposed to
spend the night before the wedding together.
Yeah, I was trying
to respect tradition...
but I got horny.
Well, I guess we'll just have to start
the honeymoon early, won't we?
Let me get rid
of this stuff.
What are you
working on so late?
Nothing.
Polling data?
Why are you polling?
The election's over.
It's just a little research.
God, you look hot.
Is this about running
for governor?
Because I told you
how I feel about that.
My Dad just set up a little
exploratory committee.
It's no big deal.
Okay, well,
let's explore it now.
Nope, not gonna happen.
Gaby...
Victor, ever
since we met,
it's been photo ops and
fund-raisers, and I'm sick of it.
Well, I'm a politician.
Do you think I want my career
to begin and end in the suburbs?
Fairview is my home,
and I don't want to leave it.
And you can't make this
decision without me.
I'm gonna be your wife.
Exactly, not my
career adviser.
Oh, so I don't
even get a vote?
Not if it's a veto.
Okay, look, no!
I already married a man who
put his career before me,
and I swore I wasn't
gonna do it again.
Well, I swore I would not let
a stupid woman hold me back.
That did not come out
the way I wanted it to.
I'm sorry.
I'm so... I'm really sorry.
I've just been under
a lot of pressure lately.
Well, here's one less thing
you have to worry about:
our wedding.
You can't cancel the wedding.
It's too late.
As far as I'm concerned,
it's just in the nick of time.
Good morning, Gaby.
God, Milton, the newspaper's
not even here yet.
I'm sorry it's
so early. I just...
came to apologize.
Why? What happened
wasn't your fault.
That's not exactly the case.
Is that coffee I smell?
You only bolted because
Victor wants to be governor.
He only wants to be
governor because of me.
You only suggested it.
You can't make him go after
something he doesn't want.
The hell I can't.
Ever since he was a kid,
Victor's been
killing himself trying to live up
to his big shot father.
He's desperate
for my approval.
Why?
I suppose because
he's never gotten it.
Everything he does,
even becoming mayor,
I somehow let him know
that it's not quite enough.
Don't get me wrong.
I'm right to push.
That's why
he's so successful.
So what are you saying,
I should marry Victor
because you're
a withholding father?
No, I just want you to understand
why he does what he does.
Fine. I get it.
But why would I want a husband who values
his father's opinion more than mine?
Well, he doesn't really care
much what I think anymore.
After you left last night, he called me
and... what's the phrase?
"Tore me a new one"?
He did?
He said because of me, he'd lost the best
thing that had ever happened to him,
and if he couldn't
win you back,
I could take my money
and buy a new son,
because I was never gonna
be hearing from him again.
He blew off $80 million?
Well, if he cares about
me so damn much,
why am I not hearing
this from him?
I think you're about to.
Is there a back
way out of here?
Aren't you gonna be late
for Gaby's wedding?
Oh, weddings are boring.
I like to sneak
in at the end,
look teary-eyed and pretend
I was there the whole time.
I am gonna see you
at the reception.
Uh, hi, Danny.
Carlos, the paperboy's here.
Could you pay him?
Come on in.
Hey, here you go, Danny.
Looks like
I'm a little short.
Can I catch you later?
No.
Okay. Hold on.
Oh, my God.
What's that?
It's birth control pills.
I'm gonna need cash.
Welcome home!
I have missed you, sweetheart!
Here, allow me.
Well, hello there, Julie.
You guys are back!
Somebody's... blonder.
Yeah, my Mom hates it, too.
So where's Danielle?
Well, while we were in Switzerland,
she ran across this boarding school,
and she fell in love
with it and just insisted
that we let her spend
a year abroad.
She must be having
a really good time.
She hasn't returned
any of my phone calls.
Well, you know, her school's
up in the mountains,
and her cell phone
reception is kind of funky.
She hasn't answered
my e-mails, either.
Well, I am gonna call her tonight
and have a little talk with her
about common courtesy,
and I'm sure that you will get an e-mail
first thing tomorrow morning.
Well, we should go. I've got to get that
bracelet to Gaby before the wedding.
Well, I'll see you
guys there. Bye.
Well, that was uncomfortable.
You have no idea.
Everyone's been
asking questions.
This might not be as
easy as we'd hoped.
There. Now you have
something new.
So how do I look?
You are now officially the most
beautiful bride that ever lived.
Until your wedding, of course.
Nice save.
It means so much to me that
we're all here together right now.
And... break!
Love you.
We are gathered here today
to join together Victor Lang
and Gabrielle Marquez in matrimony.
An honorable estate not
to be entered in lightly,
but reverently and soberly.
This is a lifetime union,
one based on love,
honor and trust...
You wanna be
my new best friend?
Premium scotch.
Keep it coming.
You are promising not
only to give of yourself,
but also to accept each other,
promising not only
to love for today,
but to extend that
love to include...
Carlos!
I thought you weren't
coming until after...
Save it.
Okay, look,
I can explain...
Don't bother!
Your lies were more
convincing when I cared.
Victor, do you
take Gabrielle...
Carlos...
You've got to understand.
I do wanna have
a baby with you,
just not yet.
I... I just...
I wanted to give you a chance
to fall in love with me first.
I don't believe you, and
I will never trust you again!
Well, what was
I supposed to do?
You backed me
into a corner,
and you were
gonna bail on us,
and I was just trying
to save what we had.
Carlos, don't leave me.
Please just talk to me.
I am done with you.
Carlos!
Ladies a gentlemen,
I present to you
Mr. and Mrs. Victor Lang.
I'm sorry!
Mrs. McCluskey!
Enjoy the wedding?
Nice. Very classy.
Although what the hell was that
brouhaha between Carlos and Edie?
I don't know
and I don't care.
Today, I'm so filled with love,
I can forgive anyone anything.
But if you do see them
again, call security.
So we're in Zurich,
and I sick
after breakfast for the
third morning in a row.
And I thought to
myself, "Dear God,
I hope I have not developed
an allergy to chocolate brioche.
Life just wouldn't
be worth living. "
So I said, "That's it.
We're seeing a doctor. "
Well, you could've knocked
us over with a feather
when he said she was already
two months pregnant.
I think it's so great, and
we could not be happier for you.
When's your due date?
Oh, not until the early fall,
but enough about me.
This is your day, you and Victor,
who, by the way, I have not met yet.
Oh, my Gosh,
that's right.
Okay, you stay here.
I'm gonna go grab him.
It is so good to be back.
I can't believe how
much is happening.
I mean, you and Gaby
getting married, and
I'm having a baby.
What's going on
with you, Lynette?
Nothing.
Same old, same old.
Really? Is everything
okay, sweetie?
'Cause you haven't quite seemed
yourself the last couple weeks.
I'm fine. Everything's just fine.
I'll tell you this much,
I'm exhausted.
I'll be glad when
this day is over.
Well, it was all worth it.
Marrying Gaby is the smartest
thing you've ever done.
With her bringing in the latino vote,
the governor's mansion's as good as yours.
Well, that's assuming
I can change her mind.
I had to make certain concessions
just to get her down the aisle.
You're the husband now.
The rules have changed.
Be nice, buy her
a few pretty things.
Trust me, you'll be able
to tame that little spitfire.
I'm not too worried. I've always
been able to manage my assets.
Did you find him?
No, I'm still looking,
but I'll let you know.
Movie's over.
And may I add... amen.
Go out and play.
Go on, go on. Out!
They're just gonna
go play guns.
Can I watch another movie?
Lynette said one was the limit,
and she'll be home soon.
No, she won't.
Whenever they
go out to a party,
they always come home at least
an hour later than they say they will.
Aren't you an observant
little monkey?
Tell me, sweetie...
Would you know anything
about a man named Rick?
Yeah, I know Rick.
My Daddy and Lynette
had a big fight about him.
Really?
Sounds like there's
maybe a little story there.
If I tell you,
could I watcha really
good grown-up movie?
If it's a really good
grown-up story.
Okay, I got you some
appetizers to tide you over.
We have mini quiches
and beef satay
and something called
"crystal coast shrimp with grits,"
but it's mostly just grits 'cause
I ate all the shrimp on my way over.
Mike?
Reverend, that was such
a beautiful ceremony.
Really, just heartfelt and
moving, the whole package.
Well, thank you.
Yeah, it was
really impressive.
So what are you
doing tonight?
Oh, Carlos.
Didn't know
you were in here.
I got a little thirsty.
Yes.
I can see that.
Gaby, I am sorry if
I ruined your wedding.
But if it's any consolation,
I also ruined my life.
What are you talking about?
A couple years ago,
I was totally happy.
I had a home, you,
a great career.
And I don't understand
how I let it all go to hell.
And now here I am,
back at square one.
I really blew it.
Ah, what am I doing?
I shouldn't be dumping
this on you.
It's your wedding day.
Go to Victor.
I'm gonna stay
right here...
Well, I don't know
how you did it.
The kids are asleep, and the cough
syrup hasn't been touched.
Boy, you're just waiting for
an excuse to give me the boot.
Well, if history's any indicator,
I won't have to wait long.
So you don't think
people can change?
I think at a certain point,
people just are who they are.
Well, I think people
can change.
Now take you.
You were the perfect
wife and Mom...
then along came Rick.
How did you...
Come on, Lynette.
You kids were young when
I was sneaking around on Glen,
but you knew
something was up.
You heard about
this from my kids?
Just the girl.
And all she knows is that Daddy
got mad because Rick "liked" you.
Nothing happened
between me and Rick.
Yes, he came on to me,
but unlike you, I controlled myself.
Well, you had Tom
to come home to.
I had your stepfather.
Hey, Glen may have bored you,
but the years we had a father
in that house were
the happiest in my life.
You didn't care about that, though,
did you? You just drove him away.
And you couldn't wait
to pay me back.
Do you remember what you said
the next year when I got sick?
No I don't.
Liar.
You said I earned it.
It was God's punishment.
How are you feeling
now, Lynette?
You think you're
being punished?
How can you say that?
You were so sanctimonious.
You could not imagine what sort
of woman could do that kind of thing.
Not so hard to
imagine now, is it?
Stop comparing us.
I never did what you did.
No, you just wanted to.
You're leaving tomorrow.
I don't want your money.
I don't want you in my house.
Hey. You are sick, Lynette.
You think you know
what you're in for
'cause you watched
me go through it?
Watching it is nothing.
You are going to feel worse than
you thought a person could feel,
and I'll be holding your hand
through every damn minute.
You can't stay if
I don't want you here.
You can fight me or you
can fight the cancer.
Trust me,
you won't have the
strength to do both.
Andrew?
Do young people
still say "awesome"?
Not so much.
Try "off the hook. "
"Off the hook"?
That doesn't even make sense.
Fine, type in "groovy. "
See if I care.
Hello? Hodge residence.
Hi, Danielle. Listen, I am sending
Julie Mayer an e-mail from you.
Now would you say that your
school was "off the hook"?
No. I would say
it was sucky,
or crappy or
a freaking nightmare.
Look, if you're gonna start
complaining, I'm going to hang up.
Mom, you have got
to talk to the nuns.
They are so harsh with me,
and they have all these stupid rules.
Well, perhaps if some of those
rules had been in place
when you took up
with Edie's nephew,
you might not be
in this little pickle.
Mom, please,
I just wanna come home.
Look, I am gonna
say this one last time.
You are gonna stay put
until that baby is born.
Now don't forget,
we're driving up this weekend,
and I am bringing your favorite
lemon squares, and...
Darling,
can I draw you a bath?
That would be lovely.
Would you give me
a hand, please?
There you go.
It's almost time for
the 6-month size.
Don't remind me.
No. No, it's no problem.
I can fix that for you.
Just give me your
name and address.
I'm Mrs. Emmeline Walcott,
and I'm at 42 Old Mill road.
All right, I gotta stop and pick up
a douglas valve, but
I should be there
in 45 minutes tops.
I hate to see you drive
when you're this tired.
There's some iced
coffee in the fridge.
See you when I get back.
You were great.
Did you all ever doubt I would be?
Just hurry up and get dressed.
We only have 45 minutes.
Are you Mike?
Yeah.
I'm looking for a
Mrs. Walcott's house.
You've come
to the right place.
Here, put this on.
You mind telling me
what Susan's up to?
Ask her yourself.
Are you sure about this?
I don't want you
to look back and
regret not having
your perfect wedding.
Well, I don't know if you've
noticed, but my idea
of the perfect wedding
keeps changing.
One day, I want white roses,
and then I want lilies.
First, I want a harpist,
and then a string quartet.
Only one thing
stays constant...
and I'm looking at him.
Why would I need anything else
to make my wedding perfect?
Well, who knew downsizing
could be so romantic?
Yeah.
Mrs. Walcott, I presume?
That's right, sugar.
Oh, you might wanna check that
breast pocket of your suit.
And just so you know,
you'll be paying for those
and the lights and the flowers.
I've never seen you
look so beautiful.
You clean up pretty
good yourself.
Are we ready?
Are you kidding?
They've been dragging this
thing out for three years.
We are gathered here
today to join together
Mike Delfino and Susan
Mayer in matrimony.
An honorable estate not
to bentered into lightly,
but reverently and soberly...
Family.
There is nothing
more important.
They're the ones who show up
when we're in trouble...
The ones who push
us to succeed...
The ones who help
keep our secrets.
But what of those who have
no family to rely on?
What happens to
those poor souls...
who have no loved ones to help
them in their hour of need?
Well...
Most learn to walk life's
road by themselves.
But a sad few of us...
simply...
stop trying.
