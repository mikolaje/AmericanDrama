Previously on Desperate Housewives...
I have another child, Lynette.
You're the one who gave
me permition, remember?
Not to sleep with a woman
who's carrying our child.
For some, love will wither...
Do I know you?
Orson Hodge, Susan's dentist friend.
While others will
wait for love.
For others,
new love will bloom...
That may never arrive.
Something awful happened on
Lake View Drive last year.
To understand why,
You need to know that when
Alma Hodge awoke that morning,
she had no idea this would be
the day she'd leave her husband.
Certainly, it began
normally enough.
She put away the groceries
per his instructions.
She hung his dry cleaning
exactly as he had requested.
She folded the towels just
as he had taught her.
It was just before noon...
Mama loves her baby.
Does the baby love Mama?
Mama!
Something inside Alma broke,
And she decided it
was time... to fly away.
Of course, she knew better than
to say this to her husband.
He thought Alma was happy,
And Orson Hodge did not
like to be contradicted.
So she waited till
he left for work, and then...
Baby, you gotta come down now.
Mama's in a hurry.
Hurry! Hurry!
If you don't get back
in your cage right now,
I'm gonna have to
leave you behind.
Please!
The next day,
Carolyn Bigsby stopped by,
and like most nosy neighbors,
she knew you learned
more if you didn't knock.
Alma?
Are you home?
Carolyn?
I'm just looking for Alma.
We had a coffee
date this morning.
She never showed.
Uh, Alma left yesterday.
Left?
We had a bit of a row.
Harvey and I thought we
heard some raised voices.
So where'd she go?
Don't know, but I wouldn't worry
about it. I'm sure she's fine.
Orson, no!
Orson, no!
So if I hear from Alma,
I'll let her know that you dropped by.
Yes, Orson Hodge was a man who
did not like to be contradicted...
by anyone.
6 MONTH AGO
It doesn't rain very often
in the town of Fairview,
but when it does, it pours.
It was on just such a day
that Bree Van De Kamp went on her first
date with her new friend Orson Hodge.
A date that ended
with a kiss in the rain.
This occurred just as Gabrielle Solis was
conferring with her new divorce lawyer,
and describing in vivid detail her
husband's affair with their maid,
who also happened to
be their surrogate.
Meanwhile...
Lynette Scavo was busy meeting her
husband's illegitimate daugher.
While resisting the urge to
strangle the girl's mother.
This happened just after
Susan Mayer learned
Mike Delfino had been badly
injured in a hit-and-run accident,
and was now in a coma at
Fairview Memorial Hospital.
At that same moment,
Edie Britt was putting up a "for sale" sign
on the lawn of the house where I once lived.
Edie had also planned to spruce up the
property by washing down the driveway.
But she was pleased to see the rain
had already taken care of that.
This is what rainy
days are good for.
They make everything clean again,
Which is necessary on a
street like Wisteria Lane...
where everything
can get so messy.
TODAY
Welcome, welcome.
Don't worry about the water,
the floors are laminated.
Here's a flyer.
And then the police found her
severed fingers in the garage.
Oh, no!
And they never found Felicia's body.
I wouldn't be surprised if someday
you opened a cabinet, and...
Hello!
Karen, dear.
Have you seen the
marble backsplash?
Oh, I just must show it to you.
Excuse us.
What are you trying to do to me,
you backstabbing cow?
They asked why the
owner was selling.
I told them that Paul
Young was in jail.
They asked why.
Conversation has a flow.
Well, knock it off.
I've been trying to unload this
house of horrors for months now,
and you are not helping.
Those are for potential buyers,
you withered old mooch.
Good luck trying to
find one of those.
Maybe you'll have an easier time with the
Applewhite house and that rec room in the basement.
Get out.
Get out.
Get out, get out, get out!
Edie, uh, do you have
a moment, please?
Yes, yes, yes, yes.
Settle down.
Come on!
Is Kayla ready yet?
Just a sec.
Honey, thank you for this.
I know it's a little weird, I mean,
to send out a family christmas photo
with your husband's love child,
but it means a lot to
her to feel included.
No problem.
She's a great little girl.
Okay?
All right, let's do this.
I am just going to,
um, check the focus.
Nora.
Lynette.
What are you doing there?
Well, it's a family photo, right?
Tom, could I,
could I check your tie again?
She sat down so quickly,
I didn't know what to say.
How about, "You're in
the frame, bitch, move"?
Lynette...
No, I am sorry.
How much of her crap do
I have to put up with?
First, it's the
little drop-bys.
Then she's inviting herself
to dinner three times a week.
Now she wants to be in
our christmas photo?
I'm sorry. No, that's not happening.
Hey, guys.
Don't fight.
It's the holidays.
Nora...
this is just for our family.
I would prefer if
you weren't in it.
Okay.
Kayla, honey, we gotta go.
They're kicking us out.
We didn't say that Kayla
couldn't be in the photo.
Yeah, well, you know what?
If I'm not your family,
then she's not your family.
It's okay.
I don't have to be
in the picture.
Fine!
Fine.
No, absolutely fine.
Put crazy at the end, and
we can crop her out later.
Fair enough. Fair enough.
Hey, everything's okay.
It's okay. Come on, guys.
Come on back.
Thank you, Lynette.
Back to the Christmas spirit
that I was looking for.
Ten seconds!
I think this is a little stiff.
I have a really fun idea.
Where are my crackers?
We're out, but I got you a pickle.
Pickles and soup?
Who eats that?
You know, that's all I got.
Ever heard of a store?
You did not just do that.
I hate pickles.
Pick it up.
Doctor say I only get
out of bed to pee.
Better for baby, remember?
Don't go.
I need you to rub my feet.
They're sore, and doctor say...
Oh, cut it out, Xiao-Mel.
The doctor didn't say anything
about rubbing your chubby stumps.
Rub 'em yourself.
You treat me like dirt.
Would you rather go
live with Mr. Solis,
in a dingy one-bedroom apartment with
no air conditioning and no cable, huh?
No, I didn't think so.
You are meanest person I know.
I am the meanest person.
You've been in this
country a year.
Modify your nouns, damn it!
What... a... bitch.
I can't wait for you
to pop out that baby,
Because when you do, I am putting you
on the first plane back to Shanghal,
And you're gonna be on all fours in a
rice paddy before the epidural wears off!
But you promised to get me
apartment in Chinatown,
so I can work for my friend in
restaurant, start a new life.
Tell it to my chinese
friend... sue me!
You know, we do have people here
in the hospital who could do that.
But I like doing it.
I think Mike would want me to.
Oops.
So have you got the results
of his latest M.R.I. yet?
I'm afraid there was no change.
Well, how long until
you can do another one?
I don't want to tell you
not to be optimistic, but...
Look, I know it's
been six months,
but he could still
come out of it, right?
I saw in the news there
was this woman in Peru.
She woke up after ten years.
There's a reason
that made the news.
You might think I'm naive,
but I know he's coming back to me.
Susan...
Don't say it.
You just keep doing your job,
and I'll keep doing mine.
Oops.
That risotto was perfect.
Just like you.
Listen, I hope you
saved room for dessert.
I got us something special from a
wonderful little bakery downtown.
That is so adorable, but I don't
think I can eat another bite.
Well, here, let me take half.
What do you say, Bree?
Will you marry me?
This is a little sudden, isn't it?
We've only known each other six months,
but I've loved you every minute of it.
But if you don't share my feelings...
No, no.
I do.
It's just that, um,
I can't help being cautious.
Since Rex, I haven't
been exactly lucky in love.
I used to feel the same way.
When Alma left me,
I was shattered,
but I realize now it was
the luckiest day of my life,
because it meant I was
free when I met you.
Luck can change, Bree.
Let me change yours.
Yes.
Yes?
Yes, I will marry you, Orson.
Ian Hainsworth
had been miserable
ever since a tragic horseback riding
accident had left his wife Jane in a coma.
For the next three years,
he shied away from all social contact,
because he wanted to be
alone with his grief.
Then one day,
he met Susan Mayer,
who, because of her own tragedy,
was just as miserable as he was.
And a friendship
slowly blossomed,
because as everyone knows,
misery loves company.
And Ian was loving
this company...
more and more every day.
Two...
Three... Oh, itch,
itch, itch, itch, itch.
Do the nurses know you do this?
Oh, hey!
Um, you weren't
supposed to see that.
Well, clearly.
Now, you can buy my silence if
you'll have coffee with me.
Oh, I would love to,
but I think I'm in a rush here.
I'm supposed to meet my
girlfriends for lunch at 1:00.
Is it 1:00 yet?
Well, you tell me.
I notice you're always rushing into
the hall to check the time, so I, um...
Well, I bought you this.
I can't accept this.
This is too extravagant.
Oh, no, it's nothing.
There was a guy on the sidewalk, had
a bunch of them laid out on a blanket.
If you look closely,
it says "Folex".
Still, I...
Please, it would make me
so happy if you'd took it.
Well, in that case,
thank you for my cheap knockoff.
Oh, my God.
I'm late.
COMING SOON...
OUR NEW PRO SHOP!
Hi!
Hi!
I'm so sorry I'm late.
No, that's fine.
Wow, white gloves.
What, are we having
luncheon in the 1880s?
Well, it's a very elegant club.
You know, Orson's been
a member here for years.
It'll be even nicer when
they finish the construction.
So you were very
mysterious on the phone.
Why did you wanna have lunch?
Well, I wanted to invite you to a dinner
that Orson and I are having this saturday.
So you asked us to a meal
to announce another meal?
That's so... Bree of you.
What's the occasion?
Oh, um, no occasion.
Just a little get-together.
What are you being
so coy about?
I'm not being coy.
She said coyly.
If you don't tell us,
we're not coming.
Oh, all right.
I wanted to wait and make a
proper announcement, but...
Orson and I are engaged.
Oh, my Gosh!
Oh, let me see!
You move fast.
I know it's quick,
but it just feels so right.
Orson is just the most warm,
wonderful, generous man.
Oh, generous.
That means he's
good in the sack.
Actually, uh, no.
We haven't had sex yet.
We're waiting until
we get married.
Oh, my God. You're serious?
No sex at all?
Not even...
Whatever you're
alluding to, no.
But you're gonna get married.
You wouldn't buy a car without at
least taking it for a little test drive.
It's not like you've never slept
with a guy you weren't married to.
True.
I have in the past given
myself away too freely.
How charming of you to bring that up
while I'm announcing my engagement.
But I like to think that I have
learned from my mistakes.
So the dinner is at 8:00, and
when we make the announcement,
Please, everybody,
look surprised.
Okay. No, don't worry.
I'm just gonna replay the look I had when
I found out you hadn't banged him yet.
Hey, sexy mama.
That's cute.
So you invited Kayla to
Parker's birthday party, right?
Of course.
And?
What did you tell Nora?
I told her that we were picking up
Kayla for a quiet afternoon at home.
You lied?
Yeah, you're damn straight I lied.
I will not have that lunatic
ruining one more family gathering.
But Kayla's gonna, you know,
tell Nora that we had a party,
and I'm just afraid that
Nora's gonna blow a gasket.
What?
So what are you saying, you're more
afraid of Nora than you are of me?
Is that what you think I meant?
Because that is so
not what I meant.
You scare the hell
out of me, baby.
Thank you.
The coffee machine was broken,
so I got us a couple of smoothies.
They had strawberry
and strawberry.
Well, I hate strawberry,
so give me the strawberry.
Hi, Jane.
Nothing, nothing
against smoothies,
but I wouldn't mind having
some real food sometime.
Maybe we could go
to a restaurant.
You mean, like,
outside the hospital?
Yeah, you know, like a date.
A date?
There's a lovely little
bistro down the street.
I'm sorry.
I'm really, really sorry.
Uh, well, that sounds, uh, just...
That sounds great!
I mean, I hope that's okay.
Yeah!
So, I was, um, I was thinking
about how that sounded just now...
the, uh, the date thing.
I really sprang it on
you out of nowhere.
Yes, you did.
Jane looked cold.
Thanks.
Look, we're, um,
we're both in difficult situations.
I've been in mine a lot
longer than you have,
So, uh, if you're not ready,
I understand.
If you ever should be,
uh, let me know.
All right.
Wow, I am really hungry.
Well, then let's, um, let's go to the
blood bank and swipe some sugar cookies.
Oh, uh, you might want to give jane a sponge
bath 'cause she had a little... accident.
Hello?
Hey, Lynette, it's me.
Hey, Nora.
Are you having a party?
Quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet!
Yeah, no, no, of course not.
In fact, we're just having
a quiet afternoon at home.
Um, the kids are so bored.
Tom and I were thinking of
taking 'em out for ice cream.
Well, would you tell Kayla that
Mommy called to check on her?
Oh, I will, I will,
and I'll see you tonight.
Okay.
Bye.
You think she bought it?
No, I think she'll be
over here in ten minutes.
Okay, let's move! Let's move!
I've got 10 bucks here for the kid
who can carry the most stuff, okay?
Hey, Gaby, it's Lynette.
Got a little emergency here.
Is that okay if we
use your backyard?
Great, great.
And we take complete responsibility
for whatever the pony does.
Hope you get this message soon.
My only concern would
be the neighborhood.
We really need a quiet
place for our retirement.
Oh, are you kidding?
There's no place in Fairview
that's more peaceful.
Stay off the pony!
Okay, guys, come on, come on! Come on!
Let me show you the media room.
Okay, go on in.
Got the balloons?
G ood.
All right.
Okay, all right, that's it.
Everybody's in.
Where's the cake?
Oh, crap!
Yoo-Hoo!
Anybody home?
Hello?
Hey, Nora.
We weren't expecting
you until 7:00.
So where's Kayla?
I thought I told you.
Tom took the kids
to the movies.
You said ice cream.
After the movies.
Movies, then ice cream.
An American tradition.
So, is something wrong?
To be honest, I thought that you
were lying and having a party.
I guess I was wrong.
Oh, apology accepted.
Want me to walk
you to your car?
Where did everybody go?
Nora, look, I am sorry I lied, but you
know, you gave me no choice, and...
Lynette, I want my daughter.
Where's the damn party?
No, I'm not telling.
Where's the party?
No! No, no!
If you want in, you're gonna
have to go through me.
I want my kid, Lynette.
Kayla!
Kayla, come out here now!
What is going on?
Well, first you have a party,
and you don't invite me,
And then you lie about it,
so now we're leaving.
Well, wait a minute.
Hold on, hold on,
hold on, hold on, Kayla.
I'm sorry.
We're sorry.
We shouldn't have done that.
But look, Kayla is
having such a good time.
Why don't we all just come
on in and have some cake,
And we can just...
Lynette, Lynette.
We can just have fun.
Could you excuse
me for one second?
Lynette.
Okay, okay, I know,
but what else could I do?
I'm just thinking of Kayla.
I know you are, Tom,
and I know you love her.
Why else do you think I'm willing to
put up with all this for six months?
Why do you think I'm willing to
say to my college roommates,
"Yes, that's my husband's love child and
her mother in our Christmas picture"?
Because I am your wife!
You always come first with me.
Do I still come first with you?
I guess I'll see you later, Nora.
Well...
I'm taking Kayla.
Well, that's a shame.
I've gotta go hoist a piata.
Mommy, they have a piata.
Fine!
I'll be back at 7:00.
But there had better be a corner
piece of cake waiting for me.
Come on, Kayla.
Go have some fun.
Go have some...
Thank you for that.
Sure.
I'll be back in 20 minutes.
Gonna go buy a piata?
I sure am.
Xiao-Mel?
Come on out! I have your lunch.
Xiao-Mel, your
favorite soap is on.
There's a doctor fondling a
patient on the operating table.
You're missing it!
Xiao-Mel?
Xiao-Mel?
Hey, quick question.
Have you, by any chance,
seen Xiao-Mel?
I can't believe
you lost our baby.
I did not lose our baby.
Stop saying that.
I know exactly where it is.
Inside some crazy chinese woman who
also stole half a chicken from my fridge.
Hi!
Hi.
Liang, right?
Remember me?
Xiao-Mel lives with me.
You came over. We had lunch.
You got some nerve
showing your face here.
Get out.
What happened to that
famous chinese hospitality?
Xiao-Mel called me.
She said you threatened to send her back
to china to work as a slave in a rice paddy.
I...
I may have mentioned deportation, but
I didn't think she'd take it personally.
Are you crazy?
It was banter.
I mean, has this country come to the
point where you can't joke with the help?
You treat Xiao-Mel like dirt.
She's just a poor, innocent girl
trying to live the American dream,
Just like your ancestors.
Oh, don't give me that
"we are the world" crap.
That woman's uterus is
harboring a stolen baby.
So if you know where she is,
you better start talking,
or else I'm gonna get the
health department down here,
and take a closer look at what
you're serving as mushu pork.
Boy, those people just don't
have a sense of humor, do they?
I'm telling you, at this number,
it's not gonna last long.
Well, we like the neighborhood,
but we've heard that some odd things
have gone on with this house.
Complete fabrication.
Malicious lies spread
by jealous competitors.
Now you've gotta check
out this storage.
You're not gonna believe
what you can fit in here.
And now the media room.
Wow, you certainly
devoured that ice cream.
Can I get you anything else?
You tell me.
Orson...
I thought we...
Orson.
Oh, I just assumed now
that we're engaged...
Well, does that change
our core values?
No.
But when I saw you standing in front
of the freezer with a clingy silk dress,
Let's just say, well,
that challenged them.
Well, I thought we agreed we wanted
our wedding night to be perfect.
Yes, but actors want
opening night to be perfect.
That's why they rehearse.
It'll be better this way.
Now, can I get you
some more ice cream?
Not in that dress.
Hi.
So I need to ask you something.
Ian, you know, from across
the hall. You met him.
Anyway...
He sort of asked me out...
on a date.
I know you're thrown.
I was thrown, too.
But he's really nice, and...
I could sort of use
someone to talk to...
who also talks back.
The thing is...
I'm sort of lonely...
and the past six months have
been really hard on me.
So what I need is...
I need to know that it's okay
with you if I go out with him.
Because if it's not, I won't.
In fact, I'd like nothing better than for you to just
wake up right now and tell me not to go out with him.
Just wake up and tell me.
Wake up.
Please!
All right.
I'll see you tomorrow.
I love you.
It is really just dinner.
I'm just dropping off Carlos,
and then I'll be by to pick her up.
Okay, thanks, Edie.
Xiao-Mel's fine.
Crisis averted.
No harm, no foul.
How can you say that?
You endangered the life
of our baby today.
Don't you dare give
me that attitude.
You have no idea what I've been
going through these past six months.
Here we go.
I have had to wait hand
and foot on your mistress.
I mean, imagine if the day after
you found out about John Rowland,
you had to make his
lunch and rub his feet.
Yeah, well, John Rowland
wasn't carrying our kid.
Forgive me for being
concerned about our surrogate.
Xiao-Mel is going to be fine.
Once that baby comes,
her slate is wiped clean.
She's gonna walk away, go off
and live her American dream.
Me?
I'm gonna be stuck, a single
mother raising a child alone,
haggling with lawyers on who
gets the kid at Christmas.
My American dream
is officially dead.
I'm sorry.
Thank you.
But just so you know,
my dream hasn't exactly...
Okay, so we will see you Saturday,
and please pretend to be surprised.
Bye.
You told someone else?
Bree, I thought the whole point of the
party was to announce our engagement.
I just can't help it.
I like telling people.
Makes me feel...
I don't know.
Makes me feel like
I'm starting over.
It feels good.
Feels good to me, too, though.
Ah, no hands. See?
Oh, you don't have to wash those.
I already did them.
Oh, I found some streaks,
so I'm wiping them down with
undiluted red wine vinegar.
I've never heard of that.
Oh, sure.
For tougher spots, I use a 50-50
mix of denatured alcohol and water.
And for those really
intractable stains, I mean,
we're talking shower doors,
I wipe on lacquer
thinner with a towel.
Bree?
Oh, Orson.
Excuse me.
Did you lose something?
No.
I just thought...
for you...
I don't do that.
Why not?
I'm a republican.
I'm a libertarian.
I believe in minimizing the role of the
state and maximizing individual rights.
But, Orson!
Trust me.
I know what I'm doing.
Okay.
Oh, no!
What, you didn't just crack
that veneer again, did you?
I have to go.
Go?
Go where?
And then it was like
something inside ruptured.
Well, not so much a
rupture as a spasm.
Waves of this hot clutching.
I think I might have
had a small stroke.
How severe were the pains?
Well, that's the odd thing.
I mean, there was no pain per se.
In fact, it wasn't entirely unpleasant.
What were you
doing at the time?
I was, uh, with my fianc?
We were lying down...
resting.
I'm gonna take a
wild swing here.
Were you having sex?
Sort of.
Ms. Van De Kamp, I think
you may have had an orgasm.
No, no, no.
I had orgasms before.
Mm, how would you
describe them?
Oh, you know, that warm sensation, that
tingling feeling of relief when it's over.
No, no, this was much...
Better?
Yes.
That's 'cause it was an orgasm.
Well, I'll be darned.
Hi. Can I help you?
Are you Bree Van De Kamp?
Yes, and you are?
Carolyn Bigsby.
I was Orson's neighbor.
Oh, well, come on in.
Let's dry you off
and get you a drink.
I didn't come here
to celebrate.
Carolyn.
Engaged again?
That was quick work.
Does she know you
killed your wife?
My wife left me.
And no one ever
heard from her again.
Not me, not her family.
Just dropped off the
face of the earth.
Orson, what is
she talking about?
Didn't tell you that part, did he?
All right, Carolyn,
you've made your little scene.
You keep your hands off me.
Don't let him fool you.
Get away from him
now while you can.
Please leave my house.
Fine.
Be a fool. Marry him.
Just don't be surprised
when you go missing, too.
I'm sorry you had
to endure that.
Your wife...
disappeared?
I tried to find her.
Her family claimed not
to have heard from her.
Personally, I think she was
just trying to punish me.
So, are you still married?
No, I was granted a divorce
on grounds of abandonment.
Bree...
You can't possibly think that...
No, of course not.
I love you.
And I love you.
Orson...
my hand.
The buffet is open.
Bree...
Every storm brings
with it hope...
that somehow by morning,
everything will be made clean again,
and even the most troubling
stains will have disappeared,
like the doubts over
his innocence...
or the consequence
of his mistake.
Like the scars of
his betrayal...
or the memory of his kiss.
So we wait for the storm to
pass, hoping for the best.
Even though we know
in our hearts...
some stains are so indelible...
nothing can wash them away.
Previously on Desperate Housewives...
It means a lot to her to feel included.
Sometimes dark clouds
have silver linings...
He sort of asked me out.
It's okay with you if
I go out with him?
Sometimes they don't.
Once that baby comes, I'm gonna
be stuck raising a child alone.
When it comes to life
on Wisteria Lane...
Will you marry me?
Things that seem too
good to be true...
Does she know you
killed your wife?
Usually turn out...
Get away from him
now while you can.
To be deadly.
Brides are sensitive creatures,
and no one knows this better than the
bridesmaids who have to deal with them.
Well, I think a 10-foot train is great,
but a shorter one would be just as nice,
and you wouldn't have to worry
about people tripping on it.
Personally, I love smoked rabbit, but for a
sure crowd-pleaser, you can't beat chicken.
Uh, sure, who doesn't
love a string quartet?
But if you got a band, maybe people
could dance, as opposed to sway.
But the one area where a bridesmaid's
tact is most required involves the dress...
So what do you think?
she's required to wear.
Well, um...
I'm not sure that I've ever seen
this shade of green before.
Yeah, don't you think it'll be
gorgeous with my coloring?
Yes, it would look perfect.
For someone with your coloring.
I mean, I was lucky to find these. Not easy
putting a wedding together in two weeks.
Then why the rush?
Yeah, Bree, I'd have thought of you
as a person who wants time to plan.
Well, Orson and I talked about it, and
we just feel at our age, it's silly to wait.
And with your help, I'm sure
we can get it all done.
Well, we are happy to pitch in.
Oh, uh, that reminds me.
I have to get a copy of
the seating chart for you.
Gaby, you are in charge
of the centerpieces.
And don't worry, Susan.
I will thinkf a job for you.
Here's a job.
How about talking you out
of marrying a homicidal dentist?
Susan, we don't know that!
All we have is some
crazy woman's accusations.
His wife vanished, and
he didn't even tell Bree.
How much more proof do you need?
He says he's innocent.
She believes him.
If we say we don't, she'll
just end up hating us.
Well, I'm sorry.
I cannot sit here on my key lime ass and
watch Bree make the worst mistake of her life!
And what mistake would that be?
Well...
Honestly...
Yes, a bridesmaid can question
many of the bride's choices.
These dresses are hideous.
But the groom isn't one of them.

The perfect couple...
We've all met them, haven't we?
That man and woman so
clearly made for each other,
we feel certain they're on
the road to happiness.
But that road has many detours,
and even perfect couples
can find themselves...
at a dead end.
You want what?!
You heard me.
And I want the bedroom stereo.
I want the marble console and
that painting of St. Augustine.
You don't even know who he is.
I know he matches the drapes.
People, can we focus here?
And I want my pearl necklace back.
Don't think I didn't notice
that you swiped it.
That was my Mama's and hers before
her. I think it belongs in my family.
There was a time that you thought I belonged
in your family, and you got over that.
Stop eating my fries!
I'm hungry.
You know what the doctor said.
You should see his cholesterol.
This man bleeds baking grease.
Enough!
You two are gonna have to find
a way to deal with each other,
because you are about to
bring a child into this world.
And divorced or not,
once that child arrives,
you will be bound together
for as long as you live.
Well, in that case...
Have some more fries.
I'll pick Kayla up on Sunday.
Whenever.
Just go. You and Turk
have a great time.
Oh, trust me, we will.
The man is a jackhammer.
Bye, Tom.
See you Sunday!
Where is she going?
She and Turk are going down
to the river for the weekend.
That's Turk? That's
the new boyfriend?
Uh-Uh, no.
Hey, hey, hey, Tom, please.
I don't want my daughter hanging
around with a guy like that.
You haven't even met him.
He could be the sweetest
man in the world.
More importantly, ever since he entered
the picture, squeaky fromme is never around.
It has been bliss.
I haven't made this face... in a week.
If you ruin this, so help
me, I will hurt you.
Just look at him.
Look at him, please.
I swear, that is a child's skull
hanging from his rearview mirror.
Doesn't that concern you?
No, I'm good.
Could be a monkey.
Uh, I think I will have the...
mesclun salad.
That's it? That's all you're having?
Well, all the food is very expensive.
You don't need to whisper.
The waiter knows
they're robbing us blind.
You can have whatever you want.
In that case, I'll have the lobster bisque
and the veal with the black truffles.
Is that okay?
Yeah, that's fine.
I'll just have jane moved
to the V. A. Hospital.
Oh, my God.
I'm kidding.
It's fine.
I'll have what she's having.
Of course.
God, I love seeing you laugh.
Oh, well, it's been a long time
since I've been in the mood to.
Thank you.
Oh, dear God!
Did I squeeze too hard?
No, it's my wife's parents.
Oh, is this gonna be awkward?
No, no, no, not unless,
of course, they see us.
Ian?
Awkward.
Jeff, Renee, what a delightful surprise.
It's so good to see you, dear.
Hello. I'm Renee, and
this my husband Jeff.
Susan Mayer.
Uh, doctor...
Dr. Susan Mayer. She's new
to Jane's neurology team.
I just assumed you worked
in Ian's publishing house.
Well, yes, and how nice
that would've been, huh?
Um, but, no, no, I'm a...
A brain specialist.
Well, Dr. Mayer, maybe I can ask you,
our daughter's most recent
E.E.G. showed brain spikes,
but it didn't change the
score on the glasgow scale.
Why is that?
What an excellent question.
And this is the, uh... spinal cord.
And it, of course,
attaches to the brain.
You don't have to dumb
it down for us, doctor.
We've been dealing with
Jane's condition for years.
Oh, good.
Um, well, then let's,
let's get technical.
Uh, let's give Dr. Mayer the night off.
She was in surgery for ten hours
today performing a craniotomy.
That's exactly the procedure Jane had.
How'd it go?
Uh, well, it just... Wow!
I hear my, my phone vibrating.
Um, hello, uh, Dr. Mayer.
Yeah, what?
You say that his brain shut off?
Oh, well, I'll be right there.
Um, stat.
I'm sorry.
Duty calls.
Orson?
I moved the furniture back!
Good lord, Bree, not again.
Don't you want our first
dance to be perfect?
There'll be 200 people staring at us.
You know, Bree...
Since that incident at our engagement party,
there's been a lot of dark talk about me.
Well, I don't pay attention to gossip.
I'm just saying I would understand if you had second
thoughts about marrying a man who's under a cloud.
Well, no one who knows you could seriously
believe that you could hurt a woman.
Strangers may talk,
but I know the truth.
Really?
Men have lied to me before.
Believe me, that'll never happen again.
So you trust me completely?
Clearly, I do.
The body is unusually well-preserved
because it was buried in clay.
Do we have a cause of death?
Blunt force trauma to the head.
I want you to pull all the missing persons reports,
cross-check against her height, age and weight.
I'm also running a D.N.A. panel since we
won't be able to use her dental records.
Why not?
Whoever killed her
pulled out all her teeth.
Nora?
What are you doing back?
Are you okay?
Shut the door!
I don't want kayla to find me like this.
What's wrong?
Tuck and I had a fight.
What?
No!
No, no, no!
What happened?
What happened is, Turk is an ass!
On the way to the river, we stoped off
at is bar. Then we were paying pool,
and I got a little bitchy with one of
the waitresses. So who cares, right?
I mean, who cares? It's a bar,
and we all do it, right?
R... Right.
So he tells me to watch my mouth.
And I'm like, whoa!
Get a load a Mr. Two Strikes trying
to tell me how to act in public.
And then he called me a whore.
We're done.
Okay, whoa!
Take a deep breath.
You don't break up with a guy because in
a weak moment he calls you a whore.
And then on the way out,
he threatened to hit me.
Okay, but he didn't.
And, you know, until...
Oh, jeez, Lynette, whose side are you on?!
I'm on the side of love.
You guys seem like
such a perfect couple.
I know.
I just, I...
You know, you don't wanna throw that all
away 'cause of a little fight with no hitting.
No.
It's over.
I just got off the phone with Turk's
parole officer, and I was like,
"Guess who ain't in Nevada no more"?
Click.
I think I'm gonna have
to stay here tonight.
Freeze!
Austin?
Anyway...
Mom just got backfrom her cruise to Jamaica
with new boobs and a 24-year-old cabin boy.
Needless to say, me and Mr.
"Can I get yousome more hot towels?",
we didn't exactly hit it off.
So after I broke his nose, I figured it was
great time to come visit my favorite Aunt.
Your mom always did
have lousy taste in men.
So, I figured I'd crash here for the night.
Then itch down to Mexico.
Hang out, party.
Yeah, I'm thinking,
like, no way in hell.
You're gonna stay here with me until
things blow over with your mom, okay?
Cool.
Thanks.
Oh, wait, you're 18, right?
Well that's what my I.D. says.
Yeah, mine, too.
You were supposed to be on bed rest.
I'm bored.
Well, why don't you try putting a pair of
pants? That should kill a couple of hours.
Hey, babe.
What is she doing out bed?
That can't be good for her.
Or the stairs.
What do you want?
The mediator was right.
A month from now we're not just
gonna be Carlos and Gaby.
We're gonna be mom and dad, and I don't
wanna be at war with the mother of my child.
So, here.
Your Mama's pearls?
Carlos...
Thank you.
And...?
And what?
Wouldn't you like to make
some reciprocal gesture?
Fine.
You can come to Bree's
wedding reception as my guest.
Thanks.
Here.
Here?
You're throwing a... reception?
Yeah, that's our wedding present to Bree.
So I give you a priceless family
heirloom, and in return,
you invite me to a party at
my house that I'm paying for?
Well, what kind of gesture
did you have in mind?
Things I'll do for jewelry.
Susan, I am so sorry.
Dr. Mayer?
Panic.
Pure panic.
Here.
These are for ruining our first date.
Not in front of Mike!
Oh, look, Mike, Ian brought you flowers.
I'll just go put them in some water.
Look, I was just trying
to protect Jane's parents.
Oh, please.
They still haven't accepted the fact
that Jane isn't going to wake up.
If they knew that we were on a date, that I was
trying to move on, well, it would devastate them.
That a really lovely excuse, but
it isn't the whole story, isn't it?
Excuse me?
A part of you feels that
you're cheating on her.
No. Well, perhaps a small part,
but that doesn't mean...
It's all right, 'cause I feel guilty, too.
That's why we should just stop is right now,
because it's all way too complicated,
And I think we'd both be happier if
we just went back to being friends.
Well, I don't think I can do that.
The truth is, I haven't thought of you
as just a friend for some time now.
Maybe I shouldn't have let
myself feel that way, but I have.
I can't go back, I'm sorry.
Well, if we can't be friends...
Then I guess we'll be nothing.
Hey, leave that alone.
Sorry, I was just...
Turning it down.
What, you're not a music fan?
Sure, it's just, um...
Got anything where a pimp
isn't beating his ho?
I'm Austin, Edie Britt's nephew.
I'm Julie, Susan Mayer's daughter.
Anyway, um, I was trying
to do my homework, so...
On a Saturday?
Well, make sure and take regular
breaks and stop for a sensible dinner.
Just keep it down.
You had it really loud.
That's how I like it.
How do you like it?
You know what?
You're not that hot.
Hey, what are you doing?
Oh, I'm working on a seating chart.
For Bree's wedding.
Nora? Who invited her?
I did.
We need to find her another boyfriend,
and weddings are crawling with single men.
Hey, I hope you're not seating
her next to any of my friends.
Hey, sacrifices must be made, Tom.
No, Jerry Rawlings!
Not Jerry Rawlings!
If she gets her psycho hooks in Jerry
Rawings, he will never speak to me again.
Oh, there are other urologists in the world.
Go back to that other guy.
The one with the cold hands?
Oh, it's once a year. Suck it up.
Get a grip, Lynette.
"Get a grip"?!
I am hanging on for dear life here.
You are the one that brought
this little problem into our family,
And the only thing I should be hearing
from you is, "how can I help"?
I am also putting Stevie Handson at her table, so you
might want to start shopping around for a new golf buddy.
Get a grip.
Hi.
My name is Susan Mayer.
Your neighbor told me
I could find you here.
Yeah?
Well, I was at my friend Bree's
engagement party the other night.
You know, when you came in and you did
that whole "Orson killed his wife" thing?
I was just wondering
if you could elaborate.
He killed her.
What else do you need to know?
Well, what makes you so sure?
Do you have any proof?
Look, I can't talk now.
I get off at 6:00.
My friend is marring that men in two hours.
Please?
Okay, I need $10 in unroled pennies
and I need to see you count it,
'cause last time you sttif me!
After Alma disappeared, the police
came and searched the house.
The police?
What did they find?
Nothing.
And that's bad, why?
Don't you get it?
When the police showed up, Orson had scrubbed
every inch of the place clean with blich.
No fingerprints,
no skin cells, no D.N.A.
It was like Alma had never existed.
Who cleans a house like that
unless he has something to hide?
So when I left the bank,
I called the detective
that worked the case,
And he said that the only reason Orson was never
charged was because they never found the body.
So he was an actual suspect?
He was the only suspect.
Oh, my God! What are we gonna do?
Well, you know
what we have to do.
That was close.
The florist put three mums
in my bridal bouquet,
but not to worry.
Crisis averted.
Bree... we have to talk.
Ah, Reverend.
Any word from the bridal party?
They're still in the bride's
room. You know women.
They're probably in there
fussing about mascara and blush.
He did not hack her up and
dissolve the pieces in acid!
I said it was a theory.
The point is, Alma disappeared under
very suspicious circumstances.
I don't have time for this.
I'm getting married now.
This is your day. You can push
the ceremony back an hour.
Now get that detective
on the phone,
talk things out with Orson.
I can't talk to Orson.
It's bad luck for the groom to see
the bride before the wedding.
You know what's really bad luck?
Marrying a wife-killer.
If the three of you don't
drop this right now,
I will never forgive you.
Bree, we are just doing this
because we love you.
But...
If you can honestly tell us that
you don't have the slightest doubt...
None whatsoever.
Dearly beloved, we are gathered
here together in the sight of God,
to join this man and woman in holy...
Excuse me?
Could you give us
just a second?
Is something wrong?
I just need a moment.
Before we do this, there's
something I need to ask you.
What?
Did you kill your wife?
Susan talked to that Carolyn woman.
Why didn't you tell me that the
police seached your house.
Because it's embarrassing,
and they didn't find anything.
Is that because you scrubbed
the house so thoroughly?
When I'm upset, I clean.
For God's sake, Bree,
I swear to you
I did not kill my wife.
Okay.
Proceed.
Dearly beloved,
We are gathered here
together in the sight of God,
to join this man and woman
in holy matrimony,
which is an honorable estate...
Hey! Look at you, miss popular!
So are you having
a good time over there?
As if,
And I don't know what idiot
stuck me at that table,
But every guy over there
is just a boring stiff.
All of them?
What about... Jerry?
Jerry's fun.
You mean Mr. Fatty hair plugs?
Oh, yeah, he's a blast.
Um, how about Steve?
You know what?
I hear his family has money.
Well, then maybe they could all chip
in and buy him some deodorant.
I'm through with those losers.
I'm gonna stay
right here with you.
Are you gonna eat that?
Hey, look at you!
God, I hate wearing a tux.
On my way in, Bree's Aunt Fern
asked me to park the car.
She's got glaucoma.
To her, you're nothing
but a hispanic blur.
Let me fix your tie.
Hey, you're wearing
Mama's pearls.
Yeah.
Hey, Julie!
Have you met
my nephew Austin?
Yeah, we've met.
I just didn't recognize
him with his shirt on.
She couldn't take
her eyes off my abs.
I felt violated.
Hi, Edie.
Nice party, huh?
It was.
Perfect.
Well, it's nice to see you
two getting along again.
We've sort of turned a corner. Really?
Does that mean you're gonna
be getting back together?
Maybe.
God, no!
Wow, is that shrimp?
What would make you think I would
even consider taking you back?
Well, you invited me
to be your date.
"Guest," Carlos. I said "guest. "
Come on, you've been flirting
with me since I came in...
"Here, baby, let me fix your tie. "
I mean, for a woman
who's not interested,
you sure are sending
some mixed signals.
You want a clear
signal? How's this?
Ian!
Susan!
What are you doing here?
Well, my cousin is Dr.
Hodges' dental hygienist,
and her husband...
He couldn't join us
since he'd come down with
a spot of impetigo, so she called me,
Knowing how much I love
a good garter toss, and so...
Ian.
Yes, I'm such
a terrible liar.
Impetigo, where did
that come from?
So what are you really
doing here?
Look...
I can't stop thinking about us,
about how great
we could be together,
and I think you're making a mistake.
Ian...
Susan, please don't go.
Can't we at least
talk about this?
I can't, 'cause I have...
bridesmaid stuff.
HI there.
I just wanted to say
you're doing a great job...
Tad.
That's, um, that's such
a masculine name.
My boyfriend
seems to like it.
Okay, here's the drill.
My ex is here, and I wanna piss him off,
so just act like you're all hot for me,
and there's a 100 buck
tip in it for you.
Right. Uh, so should
I... cup your boob?
No, I'll drive.
Tequila, straight.
Hey, are there any decent
single women athis wedding?
Not that I've seen.
Ah, damn it. Not a one.
Hey, Carlos.
You should come over to our table.
That's where all the hotties are.
Hey, everyone!
I'd say it is time that we get
Bree and Orson up here
for their first dance
as a married couple.
Ladies and gentlemen, I give you
Mr. and Mrs. Orson Hodge!
Orson,
you look so serious.
I'm trying to remember my steps.
You're upset, aren't you?
You're still thinking about
what I said at the church.
Which part, darling?
The "I do" part, or the "did
you kill your wife?" part?
I'm sorry, but I had to ask.
That's my point.
You had to ask.
You are gonna
rot in hell for this.
Hey, I just brought
two lost souls together.
Okay, how about this?
He cheated on my friend.
He deserves every bit of... crazy.
She's gonna rain down on him.
Hell... rot... you.
What are they doing?
Rounding second
and heading for third.
Carlos!
Oh, hey, Gaby.
Look, I made a new friend.
Yes, I've been watching you make
your new friend, and it's disgusting!
Do you mind?
We're trying to dance here.
Who the hell are you, anyway,
and why the hell are
you at this wedding?!
This is not gonna end well.
They're just two random people
who met at a wedding.
Can't pin it on.
It was her!
Lynette Scavo,
I wanna talk to you!
I'll see you at home.
What are you thinking?
I didn't invite you here to embarrass
me in front of my friends.
Oh, no, you just wanted me to watch while
you sucked the zits off some teenage waiter!
That's it. I take my invitation back.
You are no longer welcome
in my house.
Fine, I'll go!
Just give me back the pearls.
No!
Gaby...
Carlos, no!
They were my Mama's!
No!
Now look what you've done!
Mrs. Solis!
No, Carlos!
Hey, give me that!
Give me those!
Pardon me. Excuse me.
Get away! Those are mine!
No, the hell they are!
Mrs. Solis?
Not now, Xiao-Mei!
Mrs. Solis!
Oh, for God sakes, what?!
I think maybe it's time.
And I wish you both
a lifetime of happiness.
That was beautiful,
Aunt Fern. Thank you.
Hey, they mopped up
all the amniotic fluid,
so we should feel safe
start the conga line!
Actually, I'd like to
say a few words.
Bree, Orson,
Your love is an inspiration to us all.
That's very sweet.
Hmm.
How do you know him?
I thought he was on your side.
Well, I know, this is a second
wedding for both of you,
and I think you're jolly brave.
So often, people find excuses
not to fall in love again.
They're, they're afraid.
But it's rare to find somebody
that you connect with,
so when you do, you have
to follow your heart.
Bree, Orson,
I salute you.
All right, let's get the
music cranking and the...
Actually, Tom, could you
just hang on a second?
Uh, I also would like
to say a few words.
To Bree and Orson, uh, yes,
what could be better
than a second love?
And this time you enter into it
a little older, little wiser,
but also,
and this is key, uh...
with a bit of caution.
Because...
while love can be
spontaneous and wonderful,
it can also be selfish.
And sometimes,
the best thing you can do
is just to walk away.
Uh... Not you two.
I mean, you two
crazy kids are great.
Congrats, yeah.
Well, then, let's...
Hang on. I'd like
to respond to that toast.
Bree, Orson,
sometimes walking away
can seem the best choice.
It's certainly
the safest. But...
But what do you do when you find
someone who makes you feel joy,
when you thought you
never would again?
Do you, do you just let them go?
No.
No, I can't do that.
You, you wanna...
No.
I'm good.
All right then, let's dance!
Well, I thought you might
need a change of clothes.
You're still mad at me, huh?
What were you thinking,
setting Carlos up with skank?!
I'm sorry.
I was desperate.
I had a little too much to drink.
And you are divorcing Carlos...
No, Lynette, Carlos will
never be fair game.
You know the rules.
You're right.
You are right. You're right.
I'm so sorry.
It's just...
What?
I'm so unhappy.
Ever since that woman
pushed her way into our lives,
I can't even
wo up a smile.
And the more she pushes,
the more I resent Tom.
Tom, for something
he did 12 years ago.
And I'm afraid
if I can't fix...
this, that...
The anger is just gonna
fester until...
Lynette, listen to me.
You and Tom
will survive this.
No, seriously, Gaby, I am so
tired of pretending to smile.
You and Tom...
will survive this.
Yeah?
How can you be so sure?
Because some marriages
were built to last...
And some aren't.
Trust me,
I know the difference.
I'm looking for Bree Van De Kamp.
Could you excuse me
for just a minute?
Orson, congratulations.
Excuse me. Are you
Mrs. Van De Kamp?
It's Hodge now.
Yes, I'm terribly sorry
to barge in like this,
but we need your husband
to come down to the morgue.
We may have found
his wife's body.
Push, Xiao-Mei. Push.
Okay, okay.
Deep breaths now.
You're getting close.
It's time! I can't believe
this is happening!
I think I'm gonna cry.
Carlos, I am so sorry about the...
Yeah, i-Me, too. Me, too.
I was way out of line.
I forgive you.
It's worth it when you experience
a moment as beautiful as this.
Okay, I can see the head now.
Oh, get the camera!
Get the camera!
Oh, my God!
Oh, man, I gotta get the
color fixed on this thing.
How could this has happened?
What kind of half-Ass fertility
clinic are you running?
Prior to implantation,
your embryo was accidentally
switched with another client's.
So if we got theirs
and they got ours,
Then it's possible...
No, I'm afraid your
embryo didn't take.
Again, on behalf of the
clinic, I am so sorry.
It's rare, but these
things do happen.
Excuse me.
You screw up our lives,
and the best you can do is,
"That's the way
the cookie crumbles"?!
And who is this guy? Why is he
writing down everything I say?
This is Mr. Darby, our attorney.
We thought it wise
to have him present.
Do you know what else
would've been wise?
Sticking the right baby
in the right belly!
Mrs. Solis, please.
That's not Alma.
Are you sure?
Absolutely.
Thank God.
Carolyn. What is she doing here?
You didn't honestly think they'd
take your word for it, did you?
It's not her.
Well, that's it then.
Sorry for wasting your time.
This means nothing.
I'm telling you,
that man is as guilty sin!
We know what you think.
Now would you please
leave us alone?
He's a cold-Blooded killer.
He's kind and decent, and nothing you could
say will ever make me doubt him again.
Now please go.
You deserve him.
Darling, I am so sorry you had
to endure that. Are you all right?
I'm fine. Let's just go
back to our guests and
forget any of this
ever happened. All right.
Tu me manques, Monique.
Well...
I feel so...
Me, too.
Well, you know what
the good news is.
What's that?
Now that there's no baby,
it'll make the divorce a lot simpler.
Yeah, that's something.
So...
I'll see you
at the mediator's.
See you then.
Have you met
the perfect couple...
The two soul mates,
whose love never dies?
The two lovers,
whose relationship
is never threatened?
The husband and wife,
who trust each other completely?
If you haven't met
the perfect couple,
let me introduce you.
They stand atop a layer
of buttercream frosting.
The secret of their success?
Well, for starters,
They don't have to
look at each other.
Previously on Desperate Housewives...
God, I love seeing you laugh.
Oh, well, it's been a long time since
I've been in the mood to. Thank you.
Persistence paid off
for Susan's new friend.
You're gonna leave me out here
in the middle of nowhere?
And Bree began to regret
what she had done.
Orson Hodge dreamed
of the perfect honeymoon.
Indeed, he'd begun planning it the moment
Bree Van De Kamp agreed to marry him.
They'd start by flying first class,
to an exclusive 5-star hotel,
where they'd spend
their days by the pool,
and their nights making love.
And when they returned home,
their perfect honeymoon
would continue... forever.
Mrs. Hodge?
Yes, Mr. Hodge?
Do you have any idea how
happy we're going to be?
I don't need to be any
happier than I am already,
at this very second.
Oh, my goodness, there's only
15 minutes before our plane.
If you want that latte,
you should go now.
Yeah, that's a good idea.
The population of homeless
teenagers continues to climb.
This is Andrew.
Andrew, what is it like
to live on the streets?
It's not so bad.
I mean, you know,
Sometimes people give you food.
You can find a lot
in dumpsters.
Uh, I mean,
just last night,
I found almost a whole bucket of
chicken that had hardly been touched.
Andrew told me his
heart-wrenching story.
An alcoholic mother,
a father murdered by the woman's
boyfriend and a childhood shattered
the day his mother abandoned
him on the side of the road.
I'll tell you one thing.
Some people just should never
be allowed to have children.
Darling, I got an extra
one just in case you...
Bree, what's the matter?
A reporter just did a story on homeless
teens, and my son was one of them.
Oh, my God.
Well, we'll call child welfare
the minute we get to the resort.
Orson, you can't imagine
that we're still going!
Well, darling, the tickets
are nonrefundable.
My son is eating out of dumpsters!
Well, yes, but think how much
better you'll be able to deal
with this crisis after
a nice, relaxing...
Orson!
My child is in trouble.
Don't make me choose between the two
of you, because believe me, you will lose.
Now please, get your ass in gear.
It was at this moment
that Orson realized
their honeymoon was over...
In more ways than one.

It was a holiday weekend
on Wisteria Lane,
and everyone was
packing their bags,
hoping to get away from it all.
No, no, all right, good-bye, good-bye!
No, no! This is so... unfair.
No, no! What's unfair is that we're
slowly running out of money,
and you've barely even
looked for a job.
You're gonna have a good time,
all right? I love you. Good-bye!
Lynette was getting away from
growing tension in her marriage.
You can call it blackmail, Carlos,
but the court calls it "spousal support,"
So unless I get a check by Monday,
your shower buddies from jail will be
throwing you a "welcome back" party.
Gabrielle was getting away
from an increasingly bitter divorce.
Hi.
I'm ready.
So that's my number, in case there's
any change in Mike's condition.
I'm going to the mountains with a friend.
And, uh, just in case you were
wondering, it's strictly platonic.
He wasn't wondering.
Susan was getting away
from mounting guilt.
So you can't tell me anything
about my son's whereabouts?
And then there was Bree,
who had just learned
there are some problems...
Fine!
You can't run away from.
Some reporter.
All she could tell me was what
neighborhood they found him in.
They don't have any contact information,
no phone number, no address.
Well, dear, if he had an address,
he wouldn't be homeless.
This really blows. I am this close
to becoming homecoming queen,
and now I'm gonna be that creepy girl
whose brother's a pathetic street junkie.
You know, you could
show a little compassion.
Your brother is out there on the
streets, struggling to survive.
And whose fault is that?
Oh, she's right. This is all my fault.
You can't blame yourself.
No parent can stop a child
who's determined to run away.
He didn't run away.
I kicked him out.
You what?
I left him on the roadside with
some money and his clothes.
I didn't tell you because I was
afraid of what you'd think of me.
You did what you had to do.
I just wish you'd said something sooner.
Don't you know there's
nothing you can't tell me?
I don't want there to be
any secrets between us.
There won't be, not anymore.
You know, Andrew is not the
only one having a rough year.
I'm the one whose boyfriend
got shot right in front of her.
We'll talk in the car.
Don't you love this?
Oh, God bless Tom for taking
the kids camping this weekend.
This is exactly what we needed,
Especially after everything
I've been through lately.
I'm all about relaxing
and rejuvenating...
Gaby?
Yeah?
Could you be all about shutting up?
Oh, I'm sorry.
Thanks.
Please don't tell me you
brought your cell phone.
Oh, I'm sorry.
It's just... I'm waiting for
Carlos' lawyer to call.
This whole spousal support
thing's gotten ugly.
Hello?
Oh, hi, Tom!
No! No, no, no. No!
Yeah! Yeah, she's
right here. Hang on.
Did you say something?
Hey.
Honey, I know it is your weekend
away, but it's my damn back.
I threw it out again.
So?
So I can... I can barely sit up.
The kids are running wild.
I need you to come up here.
Well, why don't you
take a muscle relaxant?
Honey, I've already taken two.
They're not making a dent.
Well, why don't you give
them to the kids?
Ugh, Lynette!
Please don't, Please
don't do this to me.
Parker, for the last time,
Put down the damn ax!
Oh, all right. Yeah, yeah.
I will be there as soon as I can.
God, I hate my life.
I know.
I wouldn't trade with
you for anything.
Oh, wow, look at the view.
Don't you just love when
the leaves change color?
Well, that's why I suggested this,
so we could hang out for the weekend,
and... and enjoy the, um...
scenery.
Yep, the scenery's great.
So, um...
Maybe I should unpack.
Where should I do that?
Well, there are...
There are two bedrooms.
One is mine...
And there's a guest room.
A guest room.
That, well, that's handy.
Yeah.
Uh, unless, of course, you'd
like to sleep in my room.
In which case, I would
take the guest room.
Oh! I... uh, no, no!
I should take the guest room
because I am the guest.
Yeah, well, it's, uh, it's up the
stairs at the end of the hall.
Okay.
Susan, I, um...
I think I have your suitcase.
Yeah, and I think I have yours.
So, did you, um, did you
happen to see the, um...
Yeah.
And did you notice...
Hard to miss.
Well, I'm just going to, um...
Hide pathetically in your room?
Me, too.
Hey, Lynette.
What are you doing here?
Kayla called, and she
told me about Tom's back.
And my car got impounded again,
so I thought that I'd
hitch a ride with you.
Hitch?
You mean, like, we're gonna be
driving in the car together?
Well, you could strap
me to the front bumper,
but, yeah, I'd be
more comfortable inside.
Uh, it's like an 8-hour drive.
So?
Um, how far is the impound lot?
Because, you know, I could just
drive you over there and...
What's your problem, Lynette?
I don't have a problem. I just don't
think we both need to go up there.
I can grab Kayla
and bring her back.
Oh, I see your plan...
You just wanna go charging up
there on your white horse,
and save everyone,
and then I get to be
the rotten mother who didn't give a rat's
ass and stayed home eating bonbons.
No.
Due to Lynette's sudden departure...
Thank you.
Gabrielle was forced to spend the
last night of her spa vacation alone,
but she didn't mind.
In fact, she looked forward to a quiet
dinner alone with her thoughts.
Unfortunately for Gabrielle,
her thoughts quickly turned
to her impending divorce,
and the empty house
she'd soon return to.
And she began to resent the
happy couples she was seeing...
everywhere.
What is this, freakin' Noah's ark?!
I guess it really is a small world.
Who's there? I can't see you.
Can you see me now?
How much, baby?
Excuse me, ma'am?
I mean... miss,
I'm looking for someone.
Uh, his name is Andrew.
Have you seen him?
Hard to say, boo.
I see a lot of lost boys his age.
Good-looking one, though.
Someone special?
Yes, very, and I'm
worried sick about him.
You might try the soup kitchen
at St. MalachI's on third.
Oh, thank you, miss...
Gates. Pearly gates...
'Cause you can't get to heaven
without going through me.
How very saucy.
Great piano. Do you play?
Oh, no, I'm a, I'm a bit rusty.
Jane loved to sing, so I'd play
for her, but since the accident...
Right.
So...
Brandy,
A roaring fire...
What could be more romantic?
Well, I can think of something.
Wow, my heart is pounding.
Uh, is that a bad thing?
Consider the alternative.
Your heart is beating
even faster than mine.
I guess I'm excited.
It has been a while.
Me, too.
So was that, uh, okay?
It was bloody fantastic.
Of course, it's a bit different
than what I'm used to.
Different?
Well, I was with the same
woman for a long time.
Oh, yeah.
But, I mean, you kissed other
girls before that, right?
Sure, but most of them were 12.
As was I.
I met Jane at a school dance,
and after we started dating,
well, I never looked at anyone else.
Are you saying that Jane is
the only woman you ever...
Oh, God, I so didn't
want to tell you that.
Why not? I think that's adorable.
Well, I don't want to be adorable.
I want to be dashing and worldly and...
Oh, Ian. It's okay.
Some people have a lot of
lovers, and some just a few.
It doesn't matter.
Well, seeing as it doesn't matter,
where do you fall on that spectrum?
You know, how many men
have you been with?
Ian.
Oh, I'm sorry. That was rude.
I withdraw the question.
It's not that it's rude.
It's just immaterial.
I mean, it's just a number.
It doesn't mean anything.
Seeing as it doesn't mean anything...
Ian!
Well, you know my
number. It's only fair.
Is it... Is it more than three?
Nine.
Please tell me you were
answering in german.
Nine lovers is not a lot! Nine
lovers does not make me a slut!
Why are you getting upset?
Because it was really 11, and I knocked
off two, and you're still judging me.
I'm not judging you. It's just...
did you work in the recording industry?
Okay, just so you know,
11 is not a lot for
a woman my age.
How old are you?
What is this, the gallup poll?!
Where are you going?
To bed, alone.
You know, it's something that I've always wanted
to try, but I've just never gotten around to.
So they liked the landscaping
I did here so much
that they hired my company
to do whole sinclair hotel chain.
Your company?
You have a company now?
Oh, my Gosh, when I met you,
all you had was a bike.
Well, not only that,
The, uh, gardening channel's approached
me about hosting my own show.
I mean, we're still
in the talking stages, but...
What?
Nothing. I just...
I can't get over how mature
and confident you are.
You've really changed.
Thanks. I was hoping you'd notice.
So I guess, uh, there's no chance
of getting you over to the house
to pick the dead leaves off my ficus.
Yeah, you know,
I'm kind of past that.
Besides, I don't think
Mr. Solis would approve.
Actually, we're getting a divorce.
Um, I'm really sorry to hear that.
Really? Then why are you smiling?
I don't know. Why are you?
Gabrielle...
It's really great to see you.
Gabrielle.
I think that's the first time
you've ever called me that.
Well, um...
I hope you enjoy
the rest of your stay.
I intend to.
Your cuppy thing is full.
Do you mind if I put this
in your glove compartment?
Yeah, I do mind. I mind deeply.
Jeez-a-marooni.
I'll just get rid of 'em.
Oh, that's... delightful.
That's delightful.
Maybe it'll just soak up
the cream soda you spilled.
Why do you always pick on me?
It's like your new favorite game
is "finding fault with Nora. "
No, my favorite game
is counting all the things
I'm dying to say to you,
But I don't.
Like...
"Pipe down, you annoying nut job. "
I'd never say that.
You think I'm crazy.
No!
You're colorful...
Colorful in a way that might
respond to medication.
Well, you know...
There's levels of crazy, Lynette.
I mean, there are people like me
who just have a big personality.
Then there are the kind of
people who do things like this.
Ah! Oh, my God! Knock it off!
What is the matter with you?!
What is wrong with you? What the
hell do you think you're doing?
Oh, lighten up. Come on, it was a joke.
No, well, it wasn't funny.
If you wanna kill yourself, fine,
but don't take me with you.
Oh, you'd like that, wouldn't ya?
You'd really like that,
if I killed myself.
That is not what I'm saying.
But if you did,
I'd find a way toarry on.
Pull over.
Oh, lighten up. It's a joke.
Pull the car over.
Nah.
Pull it over!
Pull over, or I will jump out of this car.
All right, all right, all right, all right.
I'm pulling over! Jeez!
What the hell are you doing?!
Hitching my way...
To the campsite!
Nora!
You can't be serious!
Shut up! Just get out of my face!
I'm not talking to you!
All right, now look, you've
gone from crazy to stupid.
This guy could be dangerous.
Well, then, it's your
lucky day, huh, Lynette?
Shut up!
See?
This is what you do.
You just manipulate.
You wormed your
way into my family.
You conned your way into
coming on this trip with me,
and now you wanna
force me into saving you.
Well, forget it! You wanna go, go.
No, I've tried that.
It wasn't enough power.
Yeah, I'm way ahead of you.
All right, here it goes.
Ah, it worked! I'm a genius.
Oh, hi. Um, I'm looking for Edie.
She's out.
Ugh, God, where is everyone tonight?
Anything I can do?
No, not unless you
can fix a fuse box.
My science fair project
blew the power out.
Oh, what's your project?
Oh, uh, it's complicated.
You think I'm too dumb to
understand your little science project?
It's not little. I finished
third in the state twice.
Now can you fix
the fuse box or not?
Most houses built after 1990 are
wired through a circuit breaker.
You didn't blow a fuse.
You tripped a breaker.
Not to challenge a 2-time state science
fair almost-champion or anything.
Let me grab a flashlight.
Maybe you could also grab
a shirt... and some pants.
Pants would be nice.
Susan, can I come in?
I'm with a client. Take a number.
Susan, please.
Everything I said
came out of my own
insecurity and fear
that I might, well,
I might disappoint you.
I was gonna stay mad
at you another hour,
but your damn accent
gets me every time.
Blimey, you don't say?
Don't push it.
Oh, no, I don't mean to
break the flow, but I just, um...
Look, I know that I'm only
your second lover ever,
and that, I know
that means a lot,
and I just don't want it
to mean... too much.
I'm not following you.
What do you want it to mean?
I mean, the last time you did this,
it turned into a lifetime commitment,
And I'm just, I'm not ready for that.
You think I am?
Well, I assure you, I'm as capable
of having meaningless sex as you are.
I have never had meaningless sex.
So you were... You were
passionately in love,
and deeply committed to
all 11 of your conquests?
Don't judge me,
Mr. Virgin... plus one!
Okay, okay, we seem to have gotten
off on the wrong foot again.
Susan...
Cheerio? Bob's your uncle?
Get out.
Can't we at least talk?
Why?
You know, every time we do,
we just get angry.
Well, we're still getting
to know each other,
And that's good. You've
learned I'm a tad insecure,
And I've learn... Well, you're
just a wee bit touchy.
Okay, Ian, you know what?
This is not happening.
I am just going to sleep,
and you can just drive
me home in the morning.
Uh, excuse me. I'm looking for
my son. Have you seen him?
Have you seen him?
Excuse me, young man.
Have you seen this boy?
Andrew! Oh, my God, thank God!
What are you doing here?
Looking for you.
How did you get that bruise?
It's none of your business.
Andrew, please!
Shouldn'you be at home,
taking care of your new husband?
How did you find out that...
I read it in the paper.
You know, the one I sleep under.
Andrew, you have every
right to be angry with me,
but if you knew how sorry I am...
If you came here sucking after forgiveness,
you came to the wrong place.
Andrew, please,
can't we just talk about this?
I'm your mother, for God sakes!
You're my son.
No, you dumped your son at
a gas station seven months ago.
I'm somebody else now.
Andrew.
Andrew!
Andrew, please!
Andrew!
What happened to your ride?
The guy grabbed my boob,
so I hit him over the head
with his bong, and I got out.
Look, I'm sorry I freaked
out there before.
It's just, when you made that crack
about suicide, it just... kind of hit home.
Oh, my God, Nora.
Did you actually...
Well, I'm... I'm very
sorry. I had no idea.
But your life is better now, right?
You have a beautiful daughter,
and you have that fun job at the...
pancake house.
Oh, yeah, my life's better.
Yeah.
But it's not your life.
Your life's perfect.
Excuse me? Did you smoke that bong
before you beat the guy with it?
It's just, you have it all. You have
the kids. You have the career.
You have a husband.
You're supermom.
And you think that's easy?
Okay, I have a good life.
Yes, yes, I am very lucky,
but I work 12 hours a day,
and then I come home to
what seems like 33 children,
and husban who refuses to get a job.
And believe me, there is not a supermom
out there who wouldn't trade in her cape,
for a chance to read
a book and get a massage
by a man who has the decency
to leave when it's over.
Okay, sorry I brought it up.
I'm sorry I said that about Tom.
He's doing his best to find a job.
Well, you know, maybe he'd try a little
harder if he didn't hate advertising so much.
He doesn't hate advertising.
Last week, when he
came to pick up Kayla,
And he'd just come from
some crappy interview,
He said that he'd hated the
ad game for, like, freakin' ever,
and would like to
bag the whole thing.
He said that to you?
He's never told me that.
He's probably afraid to.
Why would he be afraid?
Probably because you're
the kind of woman who,
When someone says they
wanna kill themselves,
You say, "go ahead. "
You sure you don't want to come in?
No, I'm good.
Uh, you really should
see what I'm doing,
You know, for next time.
Okay, here's the tripped switch.
So first, you move it to "off"...
to reset, then you pre it... to "on. "
That's it?
Yeah.
You didn't have to come all
the way over here to do that.
You could've just explained it to me.
Yeah, I guess I could've.
Well... hello there.
Edie! Hi.
Oh, sorry.
Uh, he was just... He was helping
me get the lights back on.
I overloaded my circuits.
I can see that.
Yeah, so she's doing
some big science project,
And she needed me to
explain how electricity works.
I think that's called "irony. "
Julie, where's your mom?
She's on a trip.
Do you need something?
Yeah, back when I could stand her,
I loaned her my CD player. I need it.
Oh, she took it to
the hospital for Mike.
Oh, God.
This florence nightingale
act is really chapping my ass.
Hey, science guy,
I have an experiment for you.
Go home,
mix two ounces of gin,
a splash of vermouth,
and see if it improves
my mood when I drink it.
Julie, sweetie...
you're a good girl.
Do yourself a favor and stay
away from my nephew.
Trust me, I have no interest in swaggering,
muscle-bound juvenile delinquents.
Honey...
that's what every good girl says,
just before she becomes a bad girl.
Trust me, I know.
Except now when we're done,
I don't have to proofread
your essay on "Ethan Frome. "
And I don't have to jump out
of a window. That's a nice change.
Hey, how about I order
up a bottle of dom?
Ooh, I like rich John!
Hello? Oh! Uh, hi.
Nothing, uh, you know, just, uh,
room service and a movie.
What?
Really? You're... You're kidding.
Uh, no! I'm thrilled.
It's, uh, room 424.
Me, too. Bye.
You gotta get out of here.
What?
My fiance's on her way up. Oh!
Your fiance?
She was supposed to come tomorrow.
Guess she decided to
surprise me. Get dressed!
Uh, you... You're engaged?
To who?!
Her name's Tammy.
Where's your other shoe?!
How could you do this to me?
I would never have let you seduce me
if I knew you were getting married.
Well, you didn't have any problem sleeping
with me when you were married!
You knew about Carlos!
My cheating was upfront and honest.
Look, Gaby, we don't have
time for this. Get moving.
No, I'm not going anywhere. In fact,
I wanna meet the blushing bride.
Listen to me, okay?
Her name is Tammy Sinclair,
as in Sinclair Hotels,
As in her father owns
this whole damn chain.
So if she catches you in here,
I am totally screwed.
Poodle!
Look at you, surprising me.
Oh, I missed you.
I missed you, too.
Ugh, this room blows.
Daddy was supposed to
hook us up with a suite.
You know, you're right.
Why don't we go down to the
front desk and demand one?
Come on.
Oh, no. They're all booked.
They call this a closet?
Where am I suppod
to put all my stuff?
You know, I could really use a drink.
Why don't we go down to the bar?
I'm wiped. I just wanna stay in.
Didn't you unpack yet?
No, um, actually,
the zipper is stuck,
but they have a guy
at the hotel that can fix it.
You know, I should probably go
ahead and take it down to the lobby.
Now?
I'm horny.
So am I...
But I will be a lot hornier...
Once I get rid of this suitcase.
Poodle?
Where did this diamond
watch come from?
Oh, shoot, um...
That's what you get
for surprising me.
I didn't get a chance to wrap it.
You like it?
I love it!
I'm never taking it off!
Son of a bitch!
Come here, you!
John?
John, where are you, damn it?
Don't laugh.
I saved a bundle on airfare.
Susan, I'm so...
Your azaleas are breathtaking.
Thank you.
You should be very proud of them.
Yeah, it's nice to know that I can
raise some things correctly.
Darling, be patient.
Andrew will come around.
No, I don't think he will.
I failed him.
I think you're being
too hard on yourself.
And you're not being hard enough.
Stop saying that what
I did was understandable.
I'm a mother who
abandoned her child.
That's... unnatural.
Bree, it's hot. You're tired.
Why don't you come inside?
Because there is a bottle of chardonnay
in the refrigerator, and right now,
this little chore is the only thing
that's keeping me from going inside
and drinking the whole damn thing.
Well...
The azaleas really are lovely.
Yes, they are, aren't they?
Hi.
Look, I'm sorry.
Here's your watch.
I guess I'll just buy Tammy a new one.
Don't you mean her daddy will buy her a new
one and just launder the money through you?
I don't blame you for being angry.
All right, I should've told
you the truth from the start.
But when I saw you there
in the moonlight,
it took me right back
to when we were together.
Me, too.
Do you wanna sit down?
You know, you're pretty
hard to stay mad at.
Good,
'cause I really didn't
want this to end badly.
Who says it has to end?
What are you talking about?
Well, I'm single now,
and I thought we could maybe...
Gaby... I'm getting married.
Sure, and I was married
when we got together.
Right, but that...
is not how I'm gonna be married.
Well, that's what I thought,
but trust me, marriage is hard.
I know that, but...
I love Tammy,
And I don't wanna screw it up.
'Cause enough of those screwups and...
You just end up alone.
Yeah, that can happen.
Good-bye, Gabrielle.
Um, hey, mister, uh,
Could you spare a buck
or two? I'm really hungry.
Hey, thanks!
I'll give you $50 more,
you let me buy you lunch.
Fries and a large root beer.
What am I gonna have
to do to earn this?
I told you, I just wanna talk to you.
You're another reporter?
No.
You a youth pastor?
You trying to save my soul?
Oh, you make it sound like a challenge.
No, I just wanna
understand you, Andrew.
Wait, how did you know my name?
You're him, aren't you? You're, uh...
The new husband.
Orson.
You know, I wouldn't talk to her.
At makes her think I'll listen to you?
Your mother doesn't know I'm here.
All right, dad.
What do you wanna
talk about, dad?
I wanna know how you survive out
here. What do you do for money?
I ask. People give it to me.
That's it?
What do you wanna know?
Have I done stuff for money
that I'm not proud of?
Yeah, sure, but you figured that out as
soon I asked you what the $50 was for.
But, uh...
Don't tell my mom.
Or you know what? Do.
Who cares?
Well, I think part of you wants me to tell her
because you know how much it would hurt her.
I mean, that's why you're out
here, isn't it? To punish her.
When will you have punished
her enough, Andrew?
When you turn to drugs
to numb the pain,
or you catch a disease
you'll never be rid of?
Don't pretend to care
about me, all right?
I do care about you,
because Bree cares about you,
Because we're more
alike than you think.
I know about rage.
I know how it eats you up.
But rage goes away,
and when it does,
You're just left with
the mess you've made.
Thks for lunch.
You change your mind,
you know whereo find us.
How's your back?
If I don't breathe, great.
God, it has been so long
since my back has acted up.
Then wham, out of the blue,
I'm crying by a tree stump.
Well, you're under
a lot of stress.
You got a new kid in the family.
You're job hunting.
Ugh. Are we gonna fight about
that again? 'Cause if so,
I'm gonna need those last
four muscle relaxants.
No, I don't wanna fight.
In fact, I was thinking...
If you can't find something
you like in advertising,
Maybe you should cast a wider net.
Meaning what?
You're a bright guy. Isn't there
anything else you might wanna do?
I'd like to play bass for Aerosmith.
Okay, let's call that the backup plan.
But, seriously, don't you
have some road not taken,
some dream you never got around to?
I don't know, maybe.
Maybe?
I don't know. You get married.
You have kids and...
You lose track of that stuff.
Well, think about it, okay?
Cause whatever you wanna do,
I'm in your corner.
Man, did I luck out marrying you.
Tell me something I don't know.
Hi, Mike.
It's Edie.
I'm sorry that I haven't
come by to visit.
Pretty rough luck, huh?
Anyway, I'm, um...
Here to pick up my CD player.
So...
Well, I hope you feel better soon.
Damn!
And that's with the coma.
We all carry something with us.
Of course, it's nice if we
travel with someone
who can help lighten the load.
But usually, it's easier to just drop
what we've been carrying,
so we can get home
that much sooner...
Assuming, of course,
there will be someone there
to greet us when we arrive.
Why do we clutch
at this baggage,
even when we're
desperate to move on?
Because we all know
there's a chance...
we might let go too soon.
Previously on Desperate Housewives...
A reporter just did a story on homeless
teens, my son is one of them.
Oh, my God.
Orson found Andrew.
Have I done stuff for money that
I'm not proud of? Yeah, sure.
And the prodigal son returned.
Mike fell into a coma...
What could be more romantic?
I could think of... of something.
And Susan fell into the
arms of another man...
a bit too soon.
The day Mike Delfino
woke from his coma,
Edie Britt was
the first to know.
Once she was sure
he was responsive...
Mike?
Edie decided to share
the good news with others.
Code red! Code red!
My friend just woke
up from his coma.
And that is how word
began to spread.
Mike's physician, Dr. Craig,
was busy with a patient
when he first heard the news.
Not long after,
he called his aunt Ida,
who was busy
knitting a sweater.
She told Lynette Scavo,
who was busy watering her lawn.
And she told her husband Tom,
who was busy playing
at computer game.
He then e-mailed
his friend Carlos,
Who was busy plotting strategy
with his divorce lawyer.
And Carlos called his
soon-to-be ex-wife Gabrielle,
who was busy doing
the same with hers.
Yes, word of Mike's
miraculous recovery
spread quickly
throughout Wisteria Lane,
And stopped cold
everyone's busy, busy life...
Everyone, that is...
Except for Susan Mayer,
who was busy doing something
she would soon wish...
she hadn't.

Edward Sibley was the beloved
founder of the town of Fairview.
Prior to that,
he was best known
as a bootlegger...
a womanizer...
and a horse thief.
Of course, no one remembers
those parts of Edward's past.
Luckily for him, history is
designed to be rewritten...
And no one knew this
better than Bree Hodge.
So you're just gonna
lie to people?
Oh, I'm not talking about
a lie. Just a polite fiction
to explain to everybody
where you've been.
I mean, we can't
possibly tell them that
you've been living on skid row,
sleeping in a cardboard box.
So why do I have to go
to this history fair anyway?
I mean, it's just some
dumb school contest.
We all know Danielle's
not gonna win.
She never wins anything.
Is it weird eating off plates?
'Cause if you were more
comfortable, you could just
aat straight out of the garbage.
This is a family event,
and we're all gonna
enjoy it together.
Now, Danielle, stop sniping and start
thinking of an alibi for your brother.
I know. We could say he joined a cult,
and we had to kidnap and deprogram him.
Well, that would certainly spare
the family some embarrassment.
Why not throw in
a killing spree, too?
Well, here's a thought.
We say he was at drama camp.
It reflects Andrew's interest
in the performing arts,
while giving us
a private joke to savor
about the drama
of his estrangement.
Uh, yeah,
he is always like that.
Uh, guys, why can't
we just tell the truth?
Uh, I got out of line,
you kicked me out,
I lived on the street,
and I came back home.
We'll need a name
for this drama camp.
We got ties here, people!
Designer ties,
two for a dollar!
Oh, do you like
those barbells?
Make me an offer.
I'm feeling generous.
Here's the customer
I've been waiting for.
I'll give you $5 for this.
Carlos, I see you got my flier.
You're having a garage sale
featuring menswear
and sporting equipment.
I need cash, and you don't expect
me to sell my stuff, do you?
Those are my good cuff links!
Those are my cds!
Oh, my God,
this is my baby blanket.
My Mam?knitted this!
And it pains me to sell it.
It's just that my lawyer told me
what you're offering
for spousal support,
and I can't get by on that.
Hey, I am doing
the best that I can.
I've got a few deals
in the pipeline,
but I'm not making near as much as
I used to. So I should be punished?
Attention, shoppers,
for the next 20 minutes,
free golf club with
every purchase!
Gaby, I'm trying to be civil,
but if you don't
knock it off right now,
I swear, the gloves are coming off.
Oh, honey, the gloves
aren't just off...
They're 70% off!
Get your cashmere gloves!
Hey, Parker,
where's your uniform?
You got your game in an hour.
No, I don't. I quit.
What?
I hate baseball.
Daddy said I don't have
to play it anymore.
Well, daddy should have
checked with mommy,
so she could have a chance
to tell him why he's wrong.
Hey, you're playing.
But, mom, I suck!
Everybody says so.
That's why they made up
a fake position for me.
It is not fake.
There is not a team I know that could get
along without their backup far right fielder.
Okay, come on,
let's go practice.
All right, let's try it again.
Nice and easy.
Watch the ball hit the bat.
You ready? You can do it.
Here we go.
Okay, Parker,
I keep telling you, you gotta
keep your eyes open.
How are you gonna hit the
ball when you're doing this?
You threw it too fast.
Throw slower.
If I threw any slower,
we would be bowling.
Hey.
Hey, whatcha guys doing?
I'll tell you what
we're not doing, quitting.
Oh, hey, buddy,
did you change your mind?
No.
Lynette, I told him that
he didn't have to play anymore.
He's got five more
games in the season.
He made a commitment.
He's gonna see it through.
But, Lynette, he doesn't like it,
and if you haven't noticed,
he kind of sucks.
Yeah, well, that's not the point.
What kind of message are we sending if we
let him quit whenever the going gets rough?
Honey, it is kids' baseball. It's a way to
kill three hours before they eat pizza.
Why you being such a hard-ass?
Well, it's called parenting, Tom.
Watch and learn.
Okay, P-Dog,
this is a curveball.
Again, opening the eyes.
Can't stress it enough.
Are you sure it's okay
if we stay another day?
Well, let's see. What excuse did we use
when we had this conversation yesterday?
That we work hard,
and we deserve to relax.
No, I believe that was
last Thursday's rationale.
Uh, fresh air is good for us?
Ah, Tuesday.
Okay, here's one...
Julie needs to spend more
time bonding with her father.
Brilliant!
If we keep this up,
we could stay here
till christmas.
You know, sometimes
when you smile like that,
That, that really makes
me think that, that...
What? What were
you gonna say?
Well, it makes me think
that could love you.
I... don't mean "love" in the
swooning schoolboy sense.
You know,
fireworks exploding,
Bells ringing.
To me, it's about this...
A mundane task
that's suddenly a joy,
because of who
you're doing it with.
That's love to me.
Someone to fluff
while you fold,
someone to whisper
to at a boring party,
Someone to...
Shh. Do you mind?
You're kind of drowning
out the bells.
So I am.
I think I can feed myself now.
Mm, you said that yesterday,
And I wound up with
a cleavage full of pudding.
You heard the therapist.
It's gonna be weeks
before you're up and running.
I just wanna get home, unpack.
You just let home
come to you, okay?
The whole street's
dying to see you.
Bree is even bakin'
ya a peach pie.
She's the redhead, right?
Right.
Husband's a doctor...
Rex.
Rex is dead.
Really?
When did that happen?
About a year and a half ago.
What?
Yeah. You were at his funeral.
What are you talking about?
That's not possible.
I just met him right
before my accident.
Mike...
What year is it?
2004. Why?
It's called retrograde memory loss.
It's caused by the swelling
and frontal lobe damage.
You say he's lost two whole years?
Yeah. Is that unusual?
Ah, patients more typically
lose several weeks.
The damage may be more
severe than we thought.
Well, do you think
he'll get his memory back?
He might,
at least partially.
You could be of some
assistance with that.
How?
Bring him some personal belongings.
Photos, letters.
He's gonna need some help
to remember what he can't.
Oh, I'm sure I could
fill in a few blanks.
Hey, did I tell you that, uh,
Burnham Fox is looking
for a new creative director?
P.R.? What makes you think
I wanna work for a P.R. firm?
Easy hours, big paycheck,
access to great parties...
Yeah, what was I thinking?
Honey, we agreed that
I would chase my dreams,
and that ain't it.
Look, I was just
making conversation.
Batter up!
Is he up?
Oh, come on!
Come on, Parker!
Keep your eye on the ball!
Strike one!
Hey, people,
he's just a kid, okay?
Come on.
Strike two!
Hey, hey,
that is not helpful.
It only takes one, Parker!
Only takes one! Come on, Parker!
It's not your son's fault.
He's just up against
the best pitcher in the league.
Yeah, guy's a machine.
Who is that kid?
Nicky Abbott.
He's a neighbor of mine.
The kid's got an arm
like a 13-year-old.
Strike three! You're out!
I'm gonna go buy
him an ice cream.
It's okay, P-Dog.
You're gonna get 'em
the next inning!
So tell me,
what else do you know
about this Nicky kid?
You're short 50 cents.
Please, that's all I got.
Hey, give the kid
what he wants.
Thanks.
Hey, aren't you, uh,
Parker Scavo's mom?
That's right.
Come. Walk with me.
So...
Money's a little tight, huh?
A little.
Yeah, I heard your old
man's out of work.
That's gotta be tough.
Yeah, they, uh,
cut my allowance.
No! A kid's gotta
have an allowance.
How else you gonna buy
the things you want, right?
Like that cotton candy.
That's a little piece
of heaven, huh?
Hey, I got an idea. Maybe we
could help each other out.
My son's having a little
trouble hitting the ball.
Yeah, I saw that.
Yeah.
Ever seen one of these?
Carlos, what are you doing here?
I mean, besides loring
my property value.
I had a little news,
and I wanted to see your
face when I delivered it.
I'm tired of fighting,
So I called my lawyer and told him to give
in to your demands for spousal support.
Really?
Wow. Well, thank you.
Okay, you've seen my face.
Now you can beat it.
Wait. There's more.
Since I'm gonna be giving
you all that money,
I have to cut back
on some stuff,
like the rent
on my apartment.
But the good news is,
according to my lawyer,
I'm completely within
my rights to do this...
Honey, I'm home.
Wait! You can't stay here!
Now there's the face
that I was looking for.
Batter up!
Strike one!
Wow, that was
kind of slow.
His arm must be getting tired.
Yeah, well,
after all those fastballs...
Come on, Parker!
You can do it!
Strike two!
Oh, my God! Yes!
Mr. Faladi.
Yes?
Yes? I cannot thank you enough for
getting Danielle interested in history.
She has never worked so
hard on a project before.
Well, don't tell anyone,
but she is my favorite student.
Oh, and it's so good to
see that Andrew's back.
Where's he been
all this time?
Drama camp.
A very prestigious drama camp.
Do I know you?
Yeah, uh, you gave me a ride
in your black Sedan once.
You know, the one
with the reclining seats?
Excuse me.
Yeah.
Wasn't that Dr. Keck?
You know him?
Yeah. Yeah, we, uh...
met at drama camp.
Oh, good Lord.
You mean, you...
Yeah, I "performed" for him once.
Are you all right?
I'll be all right. I'm fine.
Howard Keck?
You sure?
I mean, he's a very respected
member of the community.
Yeah, well, they all were.
What were you and Andrew
talking about today at the fair?
Uh, nothing.
I was gonna make some cocoa.
Would you like some?
Orson, I saw the two of you whispering
right after Dr. Keck ran off.
What happened?
Look, Andrew asked me
not to say anything,
but I don't want there to be
any secrets between us,
so please don't
let him know I told you.
Well, of course not.
What is it?
How to put this? Uh...
When Andrew
was on the street,
he, uh, he didn't just
beg for money.
At times, he...
Well, he did things to earn it.
Oh, good. I mean, I'd hate to
think he had no work ethic at all.
Uh, what I mean is...
Men hired him, uh, to...
Do things, things
he wasn't very proud of.
Yard work?
Afraid not.
Orson, you're scaring me.
Did he do something awful?
No! Nonot awful.
I mean, people do it all
the time. I do it with you.
I just don't pay you for it.
I think someone
could use a cocoa.
Look, we mustn't judge Andrew.
He was desperate.
I'll never forgive myself.
It's all my fault for pushing him
away.
Bree, don't do that to yourself.
The important thing now is
that he's home and he's safe.
How does this Dr. Keck
fit into all of this?
I mean, is he treating Andrew
for some awful disease?
Actually, I think
he was one of Andrew's...
clients.
Howard Keck?!
Oh, that's ridiculous.
He's got a wife and a daughter.
He plays on Tom Scavo's bowling team.
Well, that's clearly not
the only team he plays for.
This is a nightmare,
an absolute nightmare.
Please don't cut into that pie.
I made it for Mike.
Mike? Delfino?
Yes. I left you two messages.
Didn't you check your voice mail?
He woke up from his coma.
Who is it? It is Sharla Banning?
I'm not telling who it is.
I'm just asking the question.
If you know a husband
has been unfaithful,
do you tell the wife?
Absolutely. If he's cheating,
he could bring home a disease.
Okay, that's what I was thinking. I mean,
that's how Bunny Connors got chlamydia.
She told me she got it from wearing
someone else's bathing suit.
No, that's how she got crabs.
Poor Bunny.
It's always something.
If it's not the clap,
it's a botched face-lift.
Be that as it may,
do we all agree that
I should tell this man's wife?
I wouldn't.
Women always say they wanna know
if their husband's cheating,
and they always resent
the person who tells them.
So if Tom was cheating,
you wouldn't tell me?
No! But I would hire someone
to beat the crap out of him.
Aw, you're sweet.
Bree, I'm sorry. I think you gotta
follow your heart on this one,
even if it isn't the easiest thing to do.
Gaby...
Are you and Carlos
getting back together?
Why?
Uh... would you excuse me?
What are you doing? I told you
I was having friends over!
I'm thirsty!
And this is my kitchen, too.
Hey, ladies!
Oh, for God sakes,
put some pants on!
Well, I wanted to, but somebody threw my
laundry out of the dryer while it was still wet.
Don't act like you
didn't deserve that.
What are you talking about?
You peed in my shampoo. Admit it!
What?!
Yeah, the cap was loose,
and I know how your
sick mind works.
Oh, really?
Well, in that case, you should know that
if I was gonna do something like that,
I wouldn't do it
to your shampoo.
I would do it to your mouthwash,
soup and decaffeinated coffee.
Ladies.
To answer your question... No,
we are not getting back together.
I love this music.
What's it about?
Making love, regret,
cigarettes.
Cigarettes?
That's what I assume.
It's french. They write
what they know.
I'd love to go to France someday.
Would you like
to go next month?
Are you serious?
Yeah, I'm going on business.
Come with me.
Oh, Ian, I just took a week off.
I couldn't possibly justify
taking another.
Oh, you'll manage.
We've already proven ourselves
masters of the flimsy rationalization.
Well... okay.
You gotta promise me we'll
actually leave the hotel room.
It's Paris, dear. You can pretty
much make love anywhere.
I thought you said you didn't
get reception up here.
We, the occasional
signal gets through.
Please don't answer.
Oh, it's Julie. I have to.
Hello? What's up?
Hey...
Uh, I can't...
No, can you say that again?
The signal's really bad.
What?
Oh, my God.
Is something wrong?
Mike woke up.
Um, Julie, when did he...
Julie? Julie!
Oh, damn it!
Oh, my God.
Oh! Oh, my God!
Uh, I... I have to go.
Um, I gotta
get out of here.
Yes, of course.
Uh, I think that
you're sitting on my bra.
What'd the coach say?
What do you think he said?
Parker's off the team.
That's not fair!
It's not his fault!
It doesn't matter,
because his mother bribed
an 8-year-old pitcher,
who also, by the way,
was kicked off of his team.
Not Nicky, too!
What were you thinking?
I was trying to repair my
son's shattered self-esteem.
With a $50?
Honey, everything would've been
fine if you had just let Parker quit.
Well, excuse me for not
wanting my son to be a quitter.
Yeah, 'cause I guess having two
in the family would be a bit much.
Whoa. Where'd that come from?
You say that you support my decision
to leave advertising
and follow my dream,
but it is obvious to
me that you resent it.
That is not true!
Why do you keep dropping all these hints
about the job at Burnham Fox then, huh?
I just figured, since you're taking your time
figuring out what your dream even is,
you might wanna make
a few bucks in the meantime.
I have a dream, too.
It includes keeping this house.
Oh, like I don't...
Are you fighting?
No!
No.
It was excitement, because
we have just decided
you don't have to
play baseball anymore.
Ah! Isn't that great?
But I can't stop now.
Huh?
Not when I'm finally getting good.
You were right, mom. I just
needed a little more practice.
So come on, come on!
Let's go practice!
See you outside.
So what's on the next page
of your parenting handbook?
Ian, can you please hurry?
I am hurrying!
We should've been on
the road ten minutes ago.
It's not like checking out of a hotel.
There's doors to secure.
I have to turn the gas valve off.
Can't you do that stuff later?
When? After the place
is overrun by raccoons?
Of course, the joke would be
on them when it blows up.
Mike is awake! He's lying there
and he's wondering where I am.
Yes, I get it.
You're in a hurry.
Just please give me a minute.
I bet you'd move faster
if Jane were awake.
Ah, here's the picture that you took
of me in my bikini at that pool party.
You could've warned me
I was showing a little nip.
Oh, Susan Mayer.
Remember her?
Yeah.
She's pretty.
Yeah, she is, sorta,
in this picture.
Is there a date
on this thing?
The nurses said that
she visited me a lot.
We were close, huh?
You have just
come out of a coma.
Can we not talk about Susan
till you start to regain your strength?
Why?
Oh, God.
I hate to be the one
telling you this...
Well, if you don't want to...
That tramp
treated you like dirt.
She strung you along.
She slept with other guys.
You broke up with her twice.
Well, why did she keep visiting
me when I was out of it?
Well, she's a bit of a stalker.
I was worried that she was gonna come in here
and disconnect one of the tubes or something.
But don't worry.
She's glommed on
to some new guy,
and she's up in the mountains
at his place with him right now.
Wow.
She told the nurses
that she really loved me.
That's the one thing about
Susan that you must never forget,
she is a liar.
You waiting to see
Mike Delfino?
Uh, yes. I'm a...
I'm a neighbor.
But, uh, he already has a
vitor, so I'll come back later.
Well, don't be surprised
if he doesn't recognize you.
He's suffered
significant memory loss.
Really?
Oh, that's too bad.
You sure you don't want to go in?
Ms. Britt's here all the time.
She won't mind.
No. I've waited this long.
I can wait a bit longer.
Gaby!
Hey, Carlos. What's up?
My key won't work.
That's probably because
I had the locks changed.
Gaby!
Can't be too safe.
You never know when someone might
move in on you when you're not looking.
Hello, 911?
There's an intruder
breaking into my home.
Can you tell them
to come armed?
I think he's mexican.
I'm telling you,
I'm her husband.
I bought her this house.
My name is on the deed.
Ma'am, if you're married,
it's a matter of public record.
I can find out very quickly.
All right, but we're going
through a very messy divorce,
and he moved back in on me.
And everyone knows
the wife keeps the house,
and the husband gets
the crappy apartment.
It's the american way.
Call my lawyer. This is all
totally legal, and she knows it.
She's just trying
to get back at me.
I hear that.
You wouldn't believe the stuff
my wife pulled when we split.
Whoa!
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
you can't take sides!
Police officers aren't
allowed to take sides.
I pay your salary.
Ted, did you see that?
This lady just assaulted me.
Oh. It was a swat.
Ted, does this hurt?
Get your hands off me!
Police brutality!
This is all my fault.
Why punish Parker?
Sorry, Mrs. Scavo.
Rules are rules.
I can't put him back on the team.
Just one more game.
He'll suck,
the other kids will taunt him,
and he'll wanna quit again.
See, everybody wins.
I wish I could help, but...
Please? You can't
bend the rules just once?
Did you know the team could
use some new batting helmets?
Are you asking for a bribe?
You pretending
you're above that?
I'll get my checkbook.
Hello, Vera.
I made you some of those, uh, shortbread
biscuits that you like so much.
How sweet!
Can you stay for some tea?
It's been so long.
We have some
catching up to do.
Yes. Yes, we do.
I know how painful
this must be for you.
It isn't easy for me either,
considering Andrew's role in it.
And why have you told me this?
Because I thought
you'd want to know.
Why?
So you could do something.
Do you think I'm an idiot?
That I know nothing about the
man I've lived with for 27 years?
I've always assumed
Howard had some... outlet,
a friend tucked
away somewhere.
I didn't know.
I didn't care to know.
But thank you
for painting so vivid,
so indelible a picture
of my husband's activities.
I'm sorry.
I just felt that
if it were me, I...
You'd want to know.
Yes, absolutely.
Then I owe you an apology,
because I've been sitting on a
little secret about your family.
Oh?
Actually, it's not much of a secret.
My daughter tells me it's common
knowledge among the cheerleaders.
What is?
The fact that Danielle is
sleeping with her history teacher.
But where are my manners?
I should have brought
some biscuits with that.
Well, aren't we just
the parents of the year?
Sitting in the stands,
waiting for our son to fail,
so we can weasel out
of a bribery scandal.
Two bribery scandals.
Gotta count the batting helmets.
Strike one!
You know, for what it's worth,
I don't think you're a quitter.
Good.
And you don't resent me?
No.
Ball one!
Okay, well, maybe a little.
Why?
You get to chase your dream while I get
to spend the rest of my life in advertising.
Strike two!
Maybe I'd like to write a book or,
you know, start my own magazine.
And then I think, "No, I can't.
I have a family to support,"
and I am okay with that...
Ball two!
Most of the time.
You know what?
I'm gonna look into that
job at Burnham Fox.
Don't you dare!
You are gonna
chase your dream,
and I am gonna support
you 99% of the time.
It's all I could
really ask for.
How the hell
did he do that?!
Yeah! Come on, come on!
Crap, they're cheering for him.
Oh, he's never gonna quit now!
What are we gonna say to him?
I don't know, buddy.
Looks like a pretty bad sprain.
Probably gonna be out
the rest of the season.
Damn.
Hey, but you know what?
That was one heck of a hit.
Sure was.
I posted your bail.
We can go.
Gaby...
Don't talk to me.
Oh, lighten up.
You were in there
for maybe an hour.
The whole thing is funny,
and you know it.
Come on, Gaby!
We've been going at each
other for months now.
Can we just stop?
You know as well as I do we're
gonna end up back together.
Wow, you are crazy.
No, what's crazy is throwing
away the past three years.
Why can't we just say what
we really feel for a change?
Fine, I'll get the ball rolling.
I still love you.
That's too bad,
because I don't love you.
Yeah, right.
I don't...
And I haven't
for a very long time.
That's a lie. You're just
saying that to hurt me.
No, if I wanted hurt you, I would
tell you about last weekend...
When I slept with
John Rowland.
Carlos, what are you doing?
Carlos!
What are you doing?! Carlos!
You can't leave me out here
in the middle of nowhere!
Carlos!
Danielle! Danielle, he is your history
teacher, and he is 35-years-old!
Robert says age is just a number.
Don't you dare leave this house!
You can't break us up!
I love him, d he loves me!
Come on, mom.
I am so tired of feeling like
the worst mother who ever lived.
You're not.
There's grandma.
I've tried so hard to
set a good example.
I've done the best I could to
teach you kids right from wrong.
Why isn't it taking?
It took.
I mean, we know the difference between
right and wrong. We just chose wrong.
Why?
Sometimes when you push a kid
really hard to go one way,
the other way starts to
look more entertaining.
You're awful.
Yeah, I know.
I blame shoddy parenting.
You know, we never...
discussed what it s like for
you while you were... away.
I just want you to know,
if you ever wanna...
talk about it, there's
nothing you can't tell me.
Thanks.
Not right now.
Okay?
I'll pick up my bags later.
It's not my fault
you weren't there.
What?
It's not.
I know what you're feeling, but...
How could you possibly
know what I was feeling?
For six months,
I have prayed every day
for that man to wake up,
and you made me give up on him.
I did not make you.
Okay, not on purpose, but you did.
You were sweet and
charming and english.
And that's why when my
prayers were answered,
I was a hundred miles away,
naked in someone else's arms.
This should never
have happened.
You can say
what you want about this,
say that you feel guilty,
say that it was bad timing,
vut don't you say that this
should never have happened!
Because you're the...
You're the best thing that's
happened to me in years.
Ian, I'm sorry.
I know how you feel.
It's Mike.
It's my Mike.
Well, then you should go.
Thank you.
Oh, my God.
You are awake.
Hi, Susan.
Oh, God!
It's so wonderful to
hear your voice again.
They say you've been here lot.
Yes! Yes, I have.
Almost every day.
I can't tell you how much I'm kicking myself
for not being here when you woke up.
Where were you?
I was in the country.
But I'm back now.
Okay.
Is something wrong? You...
You don't seem
happy to see me.
To be honest,
I don't remember you.
What?
I remember moving to Fairview
and meeting people,
but after that, nothing.
The doctors say
it's the head trauma.
But you're gonna all right.
And I'm gonna
help you remember.
And if you don't mind,
I'm kind of tired now.
Okay.
Right, you, um,
you sleep.
I'll come back tomorrow.
I'd rather you didn't.
Well, I've got therapy.
Maybe next week.
Okay.
We all have our reasons
for rewriting history.
Sometimes we need to
provide ourselves alibis...
Drama camp was awesome.
Uh, we're talking
zero supervision.
Sometimes we wanna hurt
someone who has hurt us...
So you can tell Carlos that
he can have the photo albums.
She says that they hold
no sentimental value for her.
And then there are times we just wanna
spare ourselves embarrassment...
I don't know how
these rumors get started.
No, Parker only quit the team
'cause he hurt his ankle.
Of course,
there are some who feel that to rewrite
history Is just another way to lie...
And poor Howard has to
work late again tonight.
Of course,
he does it all f the family.
But what is history anyway...
You say I dated Susan
for a long time.
Do you think I was in love with her?
But a set of lies
agreed upon?
I don't.
I really...
really don't.
whatever you wanna do, I'm in your corner.
Lynette made a promise...
Mr. Faladi...
I love him, and he loves me!
And bree's daughter
fell for her history teacher.
While mike's history...
he suffered significant memory loss.
Was being carefully rewritten.
Susan mayer.
We were close, huh?
That tramp treated you like dirt.
The art of sabotage-
it's practiced every day in the suburbs.
Sometimes it takes the form of a bundt cake
offered to a friend who's on a diet.
Other times, it's a cable cut just as a
husband's friends arrive to watch the big game.
And then there's always that anonymous
phone call to the city zoning department.
Yes, in suburbia, everyone you meet
is a potential saboteur... absolutely everyone.
Good afternoon. I'm, uh, bree hodge,
and you are?
Name's gus, and we're all booked up.
Actually, gus, um, I'm here to see
one of your guests a gentleman named faladi.
Oh, yeah, came in about an hour ago.
You want me to call him for you?
No, no, no. I'd like you to take me to his room
and unlock it, so I can walk in unannounced.
lady, I can't do that.
Besides, he has a girl in there.
Yes, I know.
She's my daughter,
my 17-year-old daughter.
Uh, that would be, uh, room, uh, 17.
Now there's irony for you.
you don't have a gun in there, do you?
Because I just put down new carpet.
Oh, gus, I don't plan anything unpleasant.
I'm simply going to inform mr. Faladi
what repercussions he faces
if he continues this relationship
and trust him to see reason.
what the hell?!
mom! What are you doing here?!
You just can't walk right in here.
How can you do this to me?!
What makes you think you can walk in here...
Yes, the art of sabotage-
It's practiced every day in the suburbs...
I told you, it's over! but I love you!
Okay, didn't you hear her?!
So how'd it go?
Quite well, I think.
But few do it as well as Bree hodge...
oh, and, gus, the carpet is beautiful.
or as politely.
Episode 5:
Nice She Ain't
Family dinner
there was a time when that phrase
meant something on wisteria lane.
Of course, this was back
when meals were lovingly prepared...
by wives who loved to cook...
for children who remembered their manners.
But family dinners, like the times,
had changed,
and there was only
one house in the neighborhood
where dinner remained a family occasion...
and attendance was not optional.
I don't know when I've tasted
such tender spring lamb.
Thank you, dear.
Danielle, you haven't touched your dinner.
She doesn't like spring lamb.
She prefers old goat.
I'm glad you guys think
it's so funny that my life is over.
Your mother was right to end that relationship.
The man was your teacher and married.
He's getting a divorce.
Well, that hardly bolsters his suitability.
Danielle, please, eat something.
Don't worry, dear.
Hunger strikes demand self-control,and as
we've seen, that's hardly her strong suit.
When are you gonna take me seriously?
When you start acting like an adult.
Well, she sleeps with them. That's a start.
I hate you!
I hate all of you!
remind me to buy paper plates.
We'll need them till a certain someone
can be trusted with china again.
Wow, you're pretty good at that.
Hey, you are home early.
Yes... I am. What is all this?
We are having a celebration.
Sit.
what are we celebrating?
You being the greatest wife in the world.
thanks.
No, seriously, though.
I mean it.
How many wives would tell their husbands
to follow his dreams,
and then have the patience to wait
while he figures out what the hell it is?
Oh, my god! You know what you wanna do!
That's fantastic! What is it?
Wait for it, wait for it...
okay, I knew I needed to spend my days
doing something I was passionate
about, something creative-
yeah, have at it um, something where
I interacted with the public
but I was still my own boss, and then
this morning, it just like-bam, it hit me!
Okay, okay, I'm dying here.
What's the dream?
You're eating it.
Excuse me?
I'm gonna open up a pizza parlor!
I bet you didn't see that one coming.
No, that was a real frisbee
to the head, that one.
But-but when you think about it,
doesn't it make perfect sense?
I mean, marinara's in my blood.
You remember uncle vito?
He came to this country with nothing.
He turned that trattoria into a gold mine.
Isn't he the one that...
asked us for a loan last christmas?
He has a gambling problem,
but don't blame the pizza.
Trust me.
I've got this thing all mapped out.
It's gonna have, like, a real family feel,
with, like, big portions but
small prices, crayons for the kids.
Oh, god, I feel good about this.
So what do you think?
I think...
I'm gonna open another bottle of wine.
But we haven't finished this one.
Well, hey, we're celebrating, right?
carlos, what are you doing in my room?
Oh, hey, gaby, you're home early.
God, carlos!
Strawberries and champagne?
Did you really think you're gonna seduce me?
Never entered my mind.
Oh, right, right.
You know, I may be living with you
until the divorce is final,
but it doesn't mean I have to put up
with your cheesy come-ons.
Gaby, can I just say one thing?
What, you've been doing some thinking,
and you realize that I'm your soul mate,
there's a vacancy in your heart only I can fill?
Gaby, listen it's over between us.
Just move on already.
Forget me.
as I was trying to say, I have company over.
This is trishelle.
trishelle, this is...
what was your name again?
I seem to have forgotten.
so the doctor said I should use as
many things as I can to jog your memory.
And not just pictures.
He said I could use tastes and smells
and sounds, so tonight is...
"sounds of the seventies.
well, you know, let me set the scene.
Um, we were at this funky little fish joint
that you'd been dying to take me to-cappy's.
Do you remember cappy's?
Okay, well, we were there, and, uh, we were
just wolfing down the most delicious trout ever
how long till the music part?
Oh, it's coming.
Um, and-and this '70s cover band,
well, they started to play, and...
that's how we got our song.
our song was "car wash"?
See how much fun we were?
so I dragged you out onto the dance floor,
and you were giving me this look
sort of like the look
you're giving me right now, and, um,
I started to do this...
and then you did this...
I'm-look, I'm sorry, this-this isn't working.
Oh, mike. Come on, you're not even
trying to remember! It was fun!
Oh, I know. Okay, sing with me.
Car wash talkin' about the car wash whoo,
car wash, yeah.
you know, I'm really beat.
Okay, mike, I-I am not doing this to upset you.
I'm doing this to help.
I get that.
It's just...
the music is giving me a headache.
Okay, well...
I'll go, but I am not giving up on you.
You know, you are going to remember
the night that we danced to "car wash, "
and not just because it was fun, but because
later that night, we did some things that,
trust me, are worth remembering.
that jane doe from the golf course...
I think I missed something at the autopsy.
Check it out.
You always gotta come at lunch, don't you?
Those blue marks on the back of her hand?
First I thought they were veins.
Now I think it's ink.
You mean, like some kind of writing?
I need to run some more tests,
see if I can get a clearer image.
I could be wrong, but...
but what?
I think it's a phone number.
The oddest thing happened at the club today.
Tish atherton-
andrew, would you be a dear and make sure
your sister's just breaking her own things?
Anyway... Tish atherton...
danielle?
yeah, I'll tell 'em.
I'm telling you, it was a deliberate snub.
I waved to her,
and she looked right through me.
True, I never bought her eldest
daughter a gift uh, mom?
Andrew, please don't interrupt
me while I'm speaking.
True, I never bought
her eldest daughter a gift,
but you know my policy-
No husband, no baby gift.
Now what is it, dear?
Well, um, danielle's upstairs
trying to commit suicide.
There's no rush. She's not trying that hard.
how can you sit there playing
that ridiculous game?!
Your sister tried to kill herself.
That doesn't upset you?
She tried to slit her wrists with a spoon.
How upset do you want me to be?
Mrs. Hodge?
Is my daughter all right?
She's a little groggy, but she'll be fine.
The wounds are fairly superficial.
so's the patient.
We'll release her tonight,
but you understand that in cases
like this, counseling is mandatory.
Of course.
We'll get her all the help she needs.
She is resisting our efforts
to pump her stomach.
She says she only took three sedatives.
She's disoriented.
Pump her.
Andrew!
Pump her.
They're sticking a tube down her throat.
Do you still think this is funny?
Mom, this was a half-assed bid for attention.
This was a cry for help,
and if we don't listen,
the next time she could do
something even more dangerous.
Yeah, next time she might jump off the porch.
Stop it!
Suicide is the worst thing
that can happen to a family!
I will not have it made light of!
orson's right.
We need to support each other as a family.
In fact, I say we all...
go for counseling.
Tom actually said he's opening up
a pizza parlor?
lynette, you're not serious.
Well, might as well stand in a vat
of tomato sauce and tear up $100 bills.
I know, but I said that I would support
him and help him follow his dream.
Well, he can't hold you to that,
not if the dream is pizza.
She promised to stand by him, & once you make
that commitment you have to see it through.
how's that divorce going?
I'm done talking.
Hey, parker, be careful up there.
I just keep thinking he's gonna come
to his senses and realize it's a bad idea.
That's never gonna happen.
Why?
Because men are genetically incapable
of realizing that their dreams are stupid.
Care to elaborate, dr. Mccluskey?
My husband sold insurance for 36 years,
and one day,
he woke up and decided he wanted
to move to paris and paint naked ladies.
I told him, gilbert,
you can barely paint the garage.
What makes you think you can commit art?
" And for the rest of his life, he despised me.
He despised you for saying "no"?
Well, he also thought I was
sleeping with his brother,
and I'm sure that was mixed in there, too.
Okay, so I got kayla all unpacked.
Oh, great. So, uh, tom will drop her off
at your house on friday.
Sounds good. Lynette,
can I talk to you for a second?
ok, pardon me for having really big ears,
but I heard about tom and this pizza place.
Do you wanna know what I think?
No, not really.
It sucks.
It's a sucky idea, and
your friends back there
they're just too nice to
come right out and say it.
Luckily, I'm not your friend,
so you can trust me.
Nip it... in... the bud.
And make tom resent me
for the rest of his life.
I don't think so.
Well, you better do somethin',
'cause if you don't,
you and me will wind up working
a pole to pay for braces.
Hey, julie.
I bought you some flowers.
Generally, when you buy flowers,
they don't still have the roots on them.
Okay, uh, I was hoping you could
help me with my english lit paper.
Hi, I'm sarah.
So what do you say?
Actually, I'm sort of busy right now.
Oh, come on.
Look, aunt edie's gonna give
me the boot if I flunk out.
Wouldn't you miss me?
Oh, absolutely!
Whose motorcycle would wake us
all up at 2:00 in the morning?
You drive a motorcycle?
please? Look, I could really
use some help here.
Normally, I charge 12 bucks an hour
for tutoring, but seeing as it's you... $15.
Great. See you friday.
oh, and just so you know, I charge $15 an hour
to make out, so I'll probably break even.
Hi.
You're new. -Where's marcy?
She's in honolulu on vacation.
Can I help you?
Oh, I'm just going to see mike delfino.
What's that smell?
Uh, that's my maconi and cheese.
I I was hoping it would trigger mike's memory.
I made it the first time we met two years ago.
You should've refrigerated it.
Edie?
Oh, you know ms. Britt?
Uh, yeah.
What is she doing here?
Visiting mr. Delfino.
You know, she was with him
when he came out of his coma.
What?!
And she's been here every day since.
You!
Hello, susan.
Long time no see.
I've been wondering why mike's
been so cold to me. Now it all makes sense.
I'm sure I have no idea
what you're talking about.
For god sakes, take a bath.
Oh, that's my mac and cheese.
Don't change the subject.
What have you been telling him about me?
Why would I say anything about you?
Mike has no idea who you are.
I envy him.
Ladies, is there a problem?
I want this woman banned from the hospital.
She's been like this ever since
mike dumped her.
Imagine "fatal attraction"...
with a much older woman.
Ma'am, mr. Delfino already has a visitor.
I think you should go.
Me?
But why doesn't she leave?
I I'm the one who's been here
every day for the last six months.
Well, I don't know you,
but I do know his girlfriend.
Girlfriend?! Okay, you know what?
I want marcy's number in honolulu,
and I want it right now.
You need to leave. -what?!
You're disturbing the other patients.
No, what are you oh, this is ridiculous!
I mean, who am I disturbing? It's a coma ward!
Don't you want them to wake up?!
Did not call you that!
Yes, you did!
I have never in my life used the word "retard".
It's what you think.
You think I'm the immature moron who
can't be trusted to decide what's best for her.
Well, you did try to off yourself.
I don't think you get to pull the
"I know what's best for me" card.
Andrew! not in front of the therapist.
Actually, I think we're making great progress.
You feel danielle refuses to see
you're acting in her best interest.
And you think your mother cares
more about her image than your feelings.
Danielle, how can you think
I don't care about your feelings?
Don't you know how much your mother loves you?
When I saw you in that tub,
it was the worst moment of my life.
The thought of losing you
is more than I can bear.
How does that make you feel?
Actually... kind of powerful.
Powerful?
You really don't wanna lose me?
Of course not.
I already went through
thinking I'd lost andrew.
I can't go through that again.
Well, then, here's what's going to happen-
I'm going to start dating robert again,
and if you try to break us up or get him fired,
then I'm going to leave,
and you will never see me again.
Danielle.
If that can survive on its own, so can I.
You don't believe me? Call my bluff.
See what happens.
So...
what do we owe you for all this progress?
Come on, austin. Concentrate.
Okay, why did iago betray othello?
because the play would suck if he didn't?
What do you think you're doing?
Sorry.
No, no, no, no! No, no, we're here to work.
And if my mom came home, she'd flip.
Now put that away.
You said, "put it away.
Look, if-if you think
I'm gonna sit here
and write your paper for you
while you're getting drunk-
no, just help me get it started, okay?
This is hard for me, all right?
I didn't read a lot of shakespeare in juvie.
I kind of majored in not getting stabbed.
Ugh, fine.
I'll write your intro, but but
then you're on your own.
Thank you very much.
so...
why did they send you to juvie anyway?
"They" didn't.
My mom did.
Why?
She had this boyfriend no job,
big drunk, real catch.
One night, he pops her one, so I break
a chair over his head, and, uh...
and she calls the cops... on me
But you were protecting her.
Yeah, that's what I thought.
But the guy said he'd leave if
she didn't press charges, and...
well, my mom doesn't really like to be alone.
You know what?
You're tired.
Um, why don't you lay down for a couple
minutes, and I'llust do a page or two?
You're a rock star, mayer.
carlos...
no Trishelle tonight?
Ah, no.
About her I have a confession to make.
Does her pimp want the rest of the money?
You know, there is some cash in my purse.
Look, I know I crossed a line
bringing her here, all right?
But I was trying to make you
jealous, like the way you made me feel
when you said you slept
with john rowland again.
Well, I think it's more than that.
I think you really hate me.
That's not true.
Oh, I think it is.
You know, introducing your spouse
to someone you're about to have sex with?
There's only one reason
to do that pure hatred.
You don't know what you're talking about.
Oh, I think I do.
Phil, come meet my basically
ex-husband thank you-carlos.
Carlos, this is my new friend phil lopez.
We've met, gaby.
Really?
Well, that's weird.
When?
Fairview chamber of commerce
the annual dinner.
Oh, my god! That's right! That's right!
you were up for the latino businessman
of the year award that phil won.
Well, actually, I beat him out twice.
No!
ooh, I remember.
Carlos was so annoyed.
What did you say, hon?
"He may have that trophy, but I've got you. "
Ain't life funny?
gaby, can we talk for a sec?
Mnh-mnh, not right now.
Phil and I are getting in the hot tub.
Ooh, phil, did you bring your suit?
You said I didn't have to.
Not in front of Carlos-cay!
go outside. I'll meet you there.
Phil lopez?
You brought home phil lopez?!
I had no idea you hated me that much!
Well, now you know.
Hey, good news.
My realtor found me some sweet locations.
That'S... great.
hey, can we talk about this restaurant thing for a second?
What's up?
I don't know if you noticed, but when
you first pitched the whole pizza concept...
I was a wee bit skeptical.
Yeah, I sensed that.
Of course you did,
'cause you're a smart guy, which is also why
you are gonna jump on the idea I have
to make the whole thing work.
Okay, so you're not bailing on me?
No, no, no, I am totally on board.
oh, good! You had me scared there for a second.
Okay, so, well, what is this great idea?
I'm thinking... catering company.
Start small, have an italian
theme, create some cash flow,
and then later on, expand
into the pizza thing.
But that's not my dream.
Well, think about it.
You're gonna do all these fun parties.
People will start talking-
"hey, this is great food.
This guy should open a restaurant.
"Yeah, yeah, I'd eat there, "
and then wham!
Five short years later,
you have a built-in customer base.
But I said it's not my dream.
Pizza is my dream.
Know, I know. Catering's how you get there.
So why can't I just skip the catering,
and go straight to the pizza?
Because you'll fail!
I'm sorry! God.
I shouldn't have said that.
But you're gambling with our life savings,
and you have no experience.
You said that you'd support me.
I'm trying to. I am trying to.
But are you aware that 90% of restaurants
tank in their first year?
Which means that 10% of them make it!
Why don't you ever think
that I would be one of them?
No! No, do me a favor. Don't answer that.
Carlos!
I'm making a snack for phil.
Do you want something to eat?
Some sour grapes, perhaps?
Maybe a little crow?
okay, we need to move this over there.
Why?
Uh, feng shui.
Oh, no, no, don't just stand there. Help me!
hey, don't start without me.
oh, no, no, let's get something straight,
you and I are not gonna have sex tonight.
What?
I'm sorry. No offense, you're a nice guy.
I'm just not into you that way.
Oh, god, phil!
Yes, yes, give it to me!
Okay. Oh, okay.
No, no, I'm not talking to you. Back off!
What-but I thought I mean...
you know, the hot tub... we were...
Yes, you saw my boobs, and
you're gonna have that mental
snapshot to use as you wish
for the rest of your life...
but that is all you're getting!
Wait, wait, so you're just using me?
You're unbelievable.
I'm what?!
you are unbelievable!
Really?
Oh, so are you, big boy!
No wonder you're divorcing her.
She's a straight-up loon.
Oh, crap. She's blocking my car!
Always happy to help a brother out.
Hold on.
oh, god, yes!
Oh, ride 'em, cowboy!
Oh, yes, god!
Take me home, philly!
You should wear a saddle!
Stop it, phil.
I told you to beat it. No means no!
I need your car keys.
You're blocking the stallion's hatchback.
"Oh, yes, yes, phil!
Fill me with phil!
" I never said that.
and you moved the bed.
What were you thinking?
Shut up.
You know, if you were trying to hurt me,
that's not the way to do it.
Well, then enlighten me.
How can I hit you so hard
that you will never recover?
You can't.
Oh, I have to, carlos.
I need you to give up on us.
We're not good for each other, and I can't keep doing this.
But I can.
You proved something tonight,
you had a rich,
good-looking guy in your bed,
and you couldn't pull the trigger.
That means you still care, and as long as I know that,
I can take anything that you can dish out.
You know what? I'm tired.
Can we talk about this in the morning?
Sure.
But you're bringing me
breakfast in bed or no deal.
it's a date.
sarah?
What are you-oh!
Oh, julie!
Thank god it's you.
We totally thought you were the cops.
oh, hey, julie.
What are you, on buzz kill patrol tonight?
This is why you couldn't
go to the movies with me?
Well, sorry, I thought
you weren't that into him.
But, you know, if you are I'm not!
I'm just I'm mad that you blew me off.
Well, I would totally understand if you
wanted to blow me off for a date.
you call this a date?
getting mauled in a car?
Hey, you wanna talk about this later?
I'm losing altitude here.
Ugh, you are disgusting!
Enjoy the rest of your date.
julie, there you are.
I think I found a way to get through to mike.
Let it go! He's not into you!
Gaby, rise and shine.
I made you some waffles.
I got a second wind last night,
so I went to a bar.
That's where I met jason.
We spent the whole night how did you put it?
Pulling the trigger.
So did I hurt you, or should I keep trying?
you kicked ass in rehab today.
Yeah, I raised my arm over my head.
Sign me up for the olympics.
Oh, be patient. It takes time.
Ms. Britt?
Phone call for you at the nurses' station.
For me?
I'll be right back.
There's a phone call for me?
Susan?
What are you shh!
I thought you could use some fresh air.
Hello?It's edie.
What the hell is this? Who's he?
Oh, this is hank, and he has very kindly
offered to take us
on a little field trip today...
for 60 bucks an hour.
Where are you taking me?
Uh, just a little jaunt down memory lane.
Oh, god, you're not taking me to
that fish and disco place, are you?
no, no.
What we're doing today
is a little more low-key.
Don't worry. You're totally safe.
We're not doing anything wrong.
punch it!
hello.
Look, mrs. Hodge, uh, I've only seen
your daughter once since the motel.
She told me that you backed off.
Oh, mr. Faladi, I'm not here to threaten you.
I've come to give you my blessing.
Your blessing?
Yes, danielle made it quite clear
that I'm powerless to stop this relationship,
and since she assures me that you love her
you do love her, don't you?
Uh, yes, of course.
Good. Then we're all set.
Here are some of her clothes.
I'll bring her cds and her stuffed
animals over tomorrow.
You want her to stay here?
This place is kind of small.
Well, that hotel room was small,
and you seemed happy enough tre.
Oh, and I trust you to be discreet.
You wouldn't want your wife find out about
this and use it against you in your divorce.
Whoa, whoa, mrs. Hodge?
Things are getting a little bit complicated.
Could you please tell danielle that this
is not gonna work out and that we-
Mr. Faladi, if you want
to break my daughter's heart,
I can't stop you,
but I will not be an accomplice.
You'll tell her yourself.
Right.
And don't even think about blaming me,
'cause if you so much as mention
that we spoke, I'll phone the police.
Fine, I will leave you out of it.
Oh, and one more thing...
yes?
Danielle is applying to colleges.
I do hope she can count on you
for a glowing recommendation.
Sure.
when I locked myself out of the house, that's
where the bush was that you found me in naked.
Surely you remember that.
Nope.
Ouch, that hurts.
Um, okay, remember this spot?
This is where we sat in your truck
and had our first kiss.
Were you naked then, too?
mike, why are you being this way?
Because this is pointless.
I... I'm sorry. I can't-I don't
remember being with you.
Okay, I know it's hard,
but you gotta make an effort,
and, you know, if your head is a little foggy,
then don't look there.
Look in your heart, because I'm in there,
just like you're inside mine.
Okay, um, this is mary alice's house,
and this is where we first met.
I was setting out my macaroni and cheese,
and you we invited oh! Ow!
I'm good.
Finally, a smile.
You do that a lot, don't you?
Well, yeah, I've been known
to take a spill or two,
but, you know,
my doctor says it's an inner ear...
wait, you remember that?
Yeah, I think I... do.
Yes!
That's progress!
See? Oh, it's all gonna come back.
We're gonna be us again!
But... what about the british guy?
mike...
I don't know what edie's been telling you,
but Ian and I we're just friends.
Just friends?
Yeah... now.
look, you gotta understand.
The doctors were telling me that
you would probably never wake up,
and, I just needed somebody to talk to.
And that's what you were
doing in the country-talking?
mr. Delfino?
Are you okay?
I'm fine.
You can't just discharge
a patient without permission!
Oh, but you-I was just trying
to help him remember.
Tell her, mike.
We were we were making progress.
Take me back to the hospital.
Oh, uh... mike!
Well, at the risk of stating
the obvious, it's over.
He's mine now.
No, no, no, no!
No, no, this-this is not how this ends.
No, evil does not triumph over good.
That's how you see me?
Damn straight!
You lie, you cheat, you scheme!
You ruin people's relationships!
I mean, how do you sleep at night?
Soon with mike on top of me,
if you know what I mean.
See? Evil! Evil!
Has it ever occurred to you that maybe
mike and I are meant to end up together?
No!
You-you-mike?
You don't even want him!
You're just doing this to hurt me.
How self-absorbed can you be?
I have had a thing for mike since
the day he moved in here,
and I even backed off when he fell
for your little miss adorable act.
But he's over that.
It's my turn now, and I will be better
for him than you ever were.
And if you do get hurt,
well... that's just gravy.
All right, maybe that was a little evil.
finally
Finally. Sorry it took so long.
That last digit was barely legible.
I thought you'd like to do the honors.
you've reached mike delfino plumbing.
Please leave a message after the beep.
Whoa, a d-minus.
That blows.
Yeah, it does, especially since
it's not the one we did together.
You e-mailed me the wrong paper.
You didn't even read it
before you turned it in?
I didn't think I had to!
The one you wrote that night was great.
Well, after you left, I decided I really
should put it in your words.
Is this some weird chick thing
you did 'cause you're into me?
Oh, please.
No, no.
No, it is.
You're, uh, pissed 'cause
I hooked up with your friend.
No, I'm pissed because you told me
some sob story so I'd write your paper for U.
Now you owe me 15 bucks.
You know what?
Here.
Oh, and, uh, i did learn something.
lago betrayed othello because he was jealous.
Oh, danielle, I thought
you'd be with mr. Faladi tonight.
Oh, you'll be happy to know he dumped me.
He dumped you?
Said it was getting too messy,
that I was gonna complicate his divorce.
Don't pretend you're sorry.
I don't plan to.
Well, I hope this doesn't make
history class too awkward.
Oh, you don't have to worry about that.
I went to the principal and got his ass fired,
and then when he called to
yell at me for squealing on him,
I recorded the call
and sent a tape of it to his wife.
Thanks to me,
he'll be getting nothing in this divorce.
Well, I must say that was rather underhanded.
Yes.
I wonder where she gets it.
bye, daddy.
Bye, hipmunk.
I'll see you guys next friday, okay?
Kayla said that you're opening a pizza place.
Well, maybe. I mean, it's not a done deal yet.
lynette put the kibosh on it, huh?
What makes you say that?
well, you know...
lynette.
Well, she's probably right.
I mean, there's a bunch of dumb hmucks
out there trying to open a restaurant, so...
you know, tom, I've tasted your pizza,
and I have to be perfectly honest with you.
It was like I died and went to italy.
Really?
Oh, my god.
You are born to do this, and I just hate
to see you give it up, because, well...
man, this is none of my business,
but lynette does...
bully you sometimes.
Well, she doesn't mean to.
Then don't let her!
You go to the mat on this one.
She will respect you a lot
more if you grow a pair.
I'm not trying to insult you.
All I'm saying is that...
I know what you're capable of,
and I believe in you.
I really needed to hear that.
thanks.
Sabotage-Everyone is capable of it,
but some go about it
more ruthlessly than others...
like the ones who crave vengeance...
or the ones who hunger for love...
or the ones who are determined to burn bridges.
And then there are those
who simply want something...
I wish daddy lived here
so he could tuck me in, too.
Something that belongs to someone else.
I'm working on it, piglet.
Mama's working on it.
Previously on Desperate Housewives:
Gabrielle got even.
So did I hurt you,or should I keep trying?
Tom got an idea...
I'm gonna open up a pizza parlor!
Bree got a warning...
he's a cold-blooded killer.
The police got a clue...
those blue marks
I think it's a phone number.
you've reached mike delfino.
This should never have happened!
And the battle for mike's affection got ugly.
How do you sleep at night?
Soon,with mike on top of me.
it is often said that confession is good for e soul.
No one knew this better than a certain blonde
who had been confessing her sins to father o'malley
once a week since she was a child.
As the years had passed,
much to father o'malley's dismay,a theme began to emerge
I seduced the cable guy again.
I'm having a affair with a folksinging duo.
Last week,I let rabbi lippman get to third base.
And once she had been forgiven,
father o'malley would tell edie britt
to go out into the world and sin no more.
Unfortunately for edie,temptation seemed to be...
hello there.
Everywhere.
Edie,what were we like together...
before the accident?
What do you mean?
You know,were we close?
Honestly?
We lived about 50 feet from each other,
and you barely knew that I existed.
Seriously?
It's true.
I mean,you weren't rude or anything.
We'd wave or exchange "hellos" as we went to get our mail
but you never really looked at me.
Not really.
I... I was just another neighbor to you.
But if we weren't friends,why are you here every day helping me?
Because from the first moment I laid eyes on you...
I sort of fell in love with you.
Yeah,and I'm not telling you this
because I expect anything,so you can just relax,okay?
Okay.
But when you do come back home,and we
do run into each other when we're getting our mail
I'd really appreciate it if you'D...
just look at me.
That's all.
I'm looking at you now.
Yes,it's often said confession is good for the soul.
Mike delfino and i made out today,and it was great!
But some confessions are just bragging in disguise.
DESPERATE HOUSEWIVES
There was nothing bree hodge hated more than an unexpected...
knock at the door.
She was always certain it would lead to a dagreeable surprise
whether it be in the form of a cosmetics saleswoman
religious zealots or extended family.
But on this day,the surprise awaiting bree was
far more disagreeable than she ever could have imagined.
Hello,bree.
Carolyn.
This isn't a very good time.
I'm baking.
Bree?
Uh,hi.
We haven't met. I'm harvey bigsby,
d I brought my wife here to apologize.
It's a souffl?
and timing is everything.
Oh,please,please,um...
she's been under a great deal of stress
since alma's disappearance,and she really hasn't been herself.
Much of that was due to the mexican painkillers
that she was purchasing online,but I put a stop to that.
well,orson tells me that the two of you were very close,
and out of respect for that friendship,I'm all ears.
After thinking it over,I realized that maybe i was out of line
I was definitely out of lin with
the terrible accusations that I made.
I'm deeply sorry for the pain that I caused.
I hope that you can find it in your heart to forgive me.
Well,I can appreciate how difficult that must have been for you.
Apology accepted.
I'm so relieved.
As am I.
Well,you don't know how rusty my golf game's
gotten without this one keeping me on my toes.
Well,perhaps we can all get together for dinner at the club sometime.
That sounds lovely.
Darling,you are amazing,you know that?
To rise above all that unpleasantness with such dignity.
Well,thank you,darling.
But if you think for one second that
I'm gonna break bread with that malicious,pill-popping shrew
you're out of your mind.
hey,susan!Whatcha doing?
I just dropped my trowel. Thanks.
All righty then,you have a nice day.
bye-bye.
susan?
Ian!
What a surprise.
Were you,um,were you hiding from me?
Uh,a little.
just,the last time we saw each other,
it was so awkward and complicated.
Water under the bridge.
And besides,this is strictly business.
I'm throwing a party for an editor friend in from london
and I thought you two should meet.
You could bring a date if you want.
Speaking of which,uh,how are things with mike?
Oh,uh,they're moving along.
It's a process.
And the,uh,blonde woman who's been visiting
him every day
is she part of the process?
Uh,edie?Oh,she'S...
just a neighbor.
She visits mike after her hepatitis c treatments.
Well,I-I do hope you can come to the party...
so you can meet my editor friend.
I just
I just don't think that's a good idea.
Right.
Well,at least I,uh,I got to see you.
You have...
this is ludicrous
the biedermeier armoire.
It's my understanding that your client doesn't even like antiques.
Totally immaterial.
It's a valuable asset.
Fine.
Let's discuss the kosta boda vase.
Nope,it's a premarital acquisition.
We can verify that with receipts.
It was a gift to mr. Solis.
Maybe you were sick that day at law school myron
but it's called community property.
Don't patronize me,kenny.
We're prepared to go to the matn this one.
Oh,enough. Just give her what she wants.
Look,I'm sick of fighting. It's just stuff.
Uh,I'd like a moment alone with my client.
This has been going on for months. I'm done.
Draw up the papers. I'll sign whatever.
You're giving me everything I want?Just like that?
Just like that.
we expect to see the paperwork by the end of business.
How sweet is that?
we nailed their asses.
Mrs. Solis,they complely folded.
That's the thing
carlos doesn't fold.
That son of a bitch is up to something.
Before you come in,cover your eyes.
Tom,I
do it!
Okay,now...
when I say "open," don't look with your eyes.
Look with your imagination.
Okay.
Okay. Open.
Oh,dear god.
Damn it,you looked with your eyes!
It's a dump!
What are you thinking?
Oh,I'll grant you it's a fixer-upper.
It's a burner-downer.
come on,honey,go with me.
We can put in booths with checkered tablecloths,
a jukebox,a big-screen to watch sports on.
How can you not see the potential in this place?
Well,I just don'T.
Tom,you know how I feel about this pizza thing.
Well,hopefully,it'll grow on you.
Don'T...
tell me you didn't sign a lease.
There's gonna be a dartboard!
Tom!
No.
There were multiple offers. I had to move fast.
You leased a building without telling me?
Well,maybe I didn't tell you because I knew
you'd try and talk me out of the best opportunity in my life.
okay.
Okay,here's what we're going to do.
You said there were multiple offers,so we can sublease.
Now let's get the hell out of here.
You said you'd support my dream.
My mistake. I assumed you'd have a dream worth supporting.
I'm gonna stay here tonight.
Fine.
two lemonades for the victors.
You keep playing like this,bree,and we are a cinch for the finals.
Hello,tish.
Hello,rebecca.
Did you see that?She just deliberately snubbed me.
Maybe she didn'totice you.
Rebecca,I just spoke to her.
And call me paranoid,but amy griswold did
the same thing to me on the golf course last week.
What is going on?
You really don't know?
No!I have no idea. What?
Tish is very good friends with carolyn bigsby.
Carolyn knows tish?
She knows everyone.
Anyway,tish won't talk to you because you married orson
even after carolyn told you that he killed his wife.
That is ridiculous. Orson did not kill almA.
And besides,carolyn just apologized to me for that yesterday.
Well,maybe that hasn't gotten back to tish.
Oh,you don't believe any of that nonsense,do you?
Do you?
Bree,you're the best doubles partner I've ever had.
Can we talk about this after the tournament?
Hello.
I'd like to make a reservation for this evening
under the names hodge and bigsby,and,um,
we'll be needing a table in the center of the room.
How long will daddy be gone?
Well,that sort of depends on daddy.
Are you two mad at each other?
Yeah.
A little.
But that's okay.
That's okay. We still love each other very much.
But just like kids,sometimes grown-ups
throw tantrums and need a time-out.
Why can't he take a time-out in his room?
'Cause he decided to take it in his pizza place.
No fair.
That sounds fun.
Not this pizza place. It's a rat hole.
But once your dad comes to his senses
and stops being petulant,he'll come home.
What's "petulant"?
It means childish,stubborn,careless with my money and your futures.
Huh?
It's a grown-up word,and when daddy comes home,
you'll learn a new one
grovel.
They got in a really big fight.
Daddy's sleeping at the restaurant.
No,no,it's good that you told me,sweet pea.
You keep those little ears open,okay?
Okay. Bye,mom.
Bye.
Oh,hey,that's for me. I'll take that.
Okay.
Well,I'm beat.
I'm gonna take a nap.
Uh,hold it.
You're a sweaty mess.
So?I was working out.
So you're not laying on anything in
this house until you take a shower.
Fair enough.
It's all yours now,right?
I don't know,myron.
It's a bunch of legal mumbo jumbo.
Just read it and call me back.
Crap!
what?
why did you put those shorts back on?
Why do you care?
Uh,it's just that they're filthy,anI was gonna wash 'em for you.
You wanna wash my shorts?
I don't want to,but if you wear them
one more time they're gonna ask me themselves.
wait a minute.
I forgot something in the pocket.
No bleach.
Got it.
so it's a job contract?
yeah welch and simon are offering him
$2 million over 3 years,plus stock options.
Well,that's fantastic!
I get half,right?
Well,no.
If you're legally divorced when he signs the contract,
then you don't see a dime.
That conniving,underhanded snake!
Thank god I broke into his desk.
At least now we know why he was so quick to fold on your settlement.
All right,well,let's just say something
happened to postpone the divorce.
I would still get my share of that $2 million,right?
Well,in theory,but...
how would you manage that?
I know how carlos thinks
more importantly,what he thinks with.
was that susan mayer?
Yeah. Why?
Mr. Delfino asked not to be disturbed.
Mike?It's me.
Are you decent?
Hey,susan.
Hey,youou.
Whatcha doing?
I suckered mccluskey into taking the kids for a while
so I could kick back and catch up with my old friend...
margarita.
you care to join us?
Believe me,I would love to,but,um,I gotta
I gotta get dinner started for julie.
Okay.
Oh,you know,what the hell?
She's 16.
If she hasn't figured out how to feed herself by now,I've failed.
That's nice.
So where were we?
You were trying to figure out how to kill edie without doing time.
Oh,right.
Oh,I wish paul young was still around. He'd know what to do.
Fine,gaby!Don't say hi!
hey!
Cocktails?Nobody called me?
It was spur-of-the-moment.
We're numbing the pain of our miserab lives.
Well,I was trying to do that with exercise
but why risk a heart attack?
Make mine a double!
I don't recognize her.
Who is she?
That's what we're trying to figure out.
Your phone number was written on her hand.
I'm sorry. I can't help you.
He's had a bit of memory loss.
After 2004,things are...
fuzzy.
No memory,huh?
That's convenient.
Well,thank you for your time,mr. Delfino.
You killed a cop once,didn't you?
That was self-defense.
Hope it wasn't just beginner's luck.
You wanna charge me with something,go ahead.
Otherwise,get the hell out of my room.
Were you always this angry,mr. Deino,or can't you remember?
So do you sell by the slice,or do I gotta buy a whole pie?
What are you doing here?
I knew how hard you were working,
so I figured I'd brinyou a little something to eat...
and drink.
You know,I can't pronounce this wine,
which means it's either really expensive or I have had too much.
I can't believe that lynette doesn't just love this place.
And if you ask me,she's just a negative nellie.
She's just being realistic.
I mean,the restaurant business is brutal.
It's
tom.
Listen to me,okay,'cause I'm a very intuitive person,
and you have a real aura of success about you.
Come on.
I'm serious.
I believe in you,
tom scavo.
Thank you.
Wait,wait,what,what
what just happened?
We kissed.
No,you kissed me.
No,no,no,you wanted me to.
No,no,no,no,no,I didn'T.
Really?
Cause this is you. My wife doesn't get me.
Hey,let's have some more wine alone,
in a deserted building.
I was just looking to vent.
I wasn't looking for anything more.
Okay,but when opportunity knocks...
nora,please!
I love my wife!
Really?
You mean,the one who thinks that you're a loser?
No,the one that loves me enough
to keep me from screwing up,
and I think it's about time I got back home to her.
You led me on.
You shouldn't have done that.
I'm just gonna say it. Tequila makes me happy.
Yeah,we're drinking on the porch.
You got a problem with that?
Oh,I know them. They live on cypress.
They just celebrated their 53rd wedding anniversary.
Show-offs.
Don't worry. It won't last.
You're just fooling yourselves!
Hey,I know them.
Oh,53 years.
What do you think their secret is?
I'll take a wild guess.
The man never opened a pizza place.
Oh,I just thought of something.
I'm never gonna lebrate a 53rd wedding anniversary.
I'd have to live into my 90s.
Oh,my god. I'm gonna die.
Bite on this.
can I tell you guys something...
something I can only tell you guys?
Oh,god,here she goes again.
What grade is he in?
Not what I was gonna say.
What I was gonna say is with all his conniving
and trickery I still love carlos.
Yeah,he's hot.
Anyway,what if I never find
that passion with anybody else?
Well,maybe you should try to patch things up with him.
Nah,I already paid a lawyer. I'm taking him down.
I brought this on myself. I tell tom,
I want you to be your own man.
" But the truth is,I don'T.
I want him to have what he wants if it's what I want.
I'm a bitch with a capital "C.
No! No,you're not!
You're a great wife and a great mother.
Although... don't you have children?
I had passion with mike...
and drama.
Lots of drama.
Love isn't supposed to be that hard.
Oh,sweetie!
But,you know,with ian,everything was always easy.
You know,that's the kind of guy I could
see myself living into my 90s with.
So go to ian!
Tell him you made the wrong choice,
and he's the one you wanna be with.
What have you got to lose?
excuse me,ladies?
Look,susan,god called you a cab.
I'm looking for,uh,4347. Ida greenberg?
I'm ida greenberg!
Yeah,you are!
see you later!
go,ida!
Go,ida!
susan.
You came.
Of course I came.
Oh,I just love your house. It always smells like you.
Oh,my gosh!
What... is the thing... is that tonight?
Well,yes. Isn't that why you're here?
No! No,no!
Actually,I just... I just had something to tell you.
Well,of course. Ah,doug,see if you can find judith for me.
Thank you.
Well,as long as you're here,I want you to
meet that editor I was telling you about.
Oh,I don't think that's a good idea,
cause I-I didn't really bring my "a" game.
is it hot?
Are you sloshed?
susan!
Oh,is this the susan you've been telling us all about?
Yes,this is she.
Could you,um,give us a moment?
Oh,of course.
what's going on?
Nothing. I just had a few drinks with
my girlfriends,and thank god,
because it gave me the courage to come
over here and tell you what's really in my heart.
um,go on.
But first,I think I should use the powder room.
Uh,oh... oh,of course. It's,um,it's over there.
She seems nice,ian.
Oh,yes,she's,um,she's absolutely delightful.
oh,I'm so sorry that you had to see that.
I see you've met judith.
so with a hundred bucks riding on it,the pressure's on me now.
I reach into my bag,I grab my 4-iron
and bada bing... hole in one.
And there's been no living with him ever since.
did I not tell you how hilarious these two are together?
Oh,they are a regular barrel of... tish!
Why,hello,bree.
Carolyn.
Do you two know each other?
Well,that saves me an introduction.
Uh,tish,you know,I was wondering if
you need any help with the christmas gala.
Last year,I was on the decoratis committee...
oh,my god,I forgot to call you. What an idiot!
We'll talk first thing tomorrow.
That would be lovely. Thanks.
Nice to see you.
Nice to be seen.
Well,I need to powder my nose. Care to join me?
Oh,I'd love to.
I'm so happy we did this.
Yes,me,too. It's been a delightful evening.
So,so fun.
Could you get us some extra tissues? Thank you.
You know,I realized something just the other day.
You've never seen a picture of alma,have you?
No. Why?
Granted,it's not her best look.
What is all this?
That's the police report that alma filed after orson hit her.
It's all in there... the bruises,contusions,broken wrist.
This is not possible.
Photos don't lie,bree.
Is this why you apologized?
Yes.
I wanted you to spend time with me so
you can see I'm not some crazy nut out to get you.
I'm sorry,but if something like that
happened again, I could never forgive myself.
Thank you.
I had a feeling you might need these.
Bring me another one.
Hey,buddy...
you wanna slow down a little bit,huh?
harvey?
Look,I'm going through something,
and I don't have anyone else to talk to about it.
I had an affair.
Uh,does carolyn know?
No,she has no idea.
I met this girl on a flight from paris,and... and we just... mmm,connected.
No,I know it sounds crazy,but it was...
love at first sight.
Well,are you still seeing her?
No,that's the thing.
A few months ago,she stopped returning my calls,
and then I went by her place
and I've looked for her everywhere,
and she's just disappeared.
No,I... I'll tell ya,now I know what you went,
through with alma. It's brutal.
It gets better. Trust me.
I I just can't get past it. I-I'M...
I can't get monique out of my mind.
Monique?
That's her name.
Monique...
polier.
Isn't she beautiful?
She'S... very pretty.
They're back.
You two girls were gone a long tim everything okay?
Mm-hmm,absolutely.
So... who wants dessert?
What have you been up to?
just a quiet night with the girls.
listen,something happened tonight,and it got me thinking,and...
you mean more to me than any restaurant ever could.
Oh,stop right there. I am the one who should
apologize. I have been a bad wife.
No,no,no,no,no!
You were just trying to keep me from
doing something reckless.
Yeah,well,any wife can support a husband who never takes risks,
and I don't want that kind of husband,
and I'll be damned if I'm gonna be that kind of wife.
So you open your pizza place,and
we will find a way to make it work.
You don't know how much it means to me to hear that.
God,I love U.
So what happened tonight?
Okay,but don't react until I've told you the whole story.
And remember,it's actually a good thing,
because it brought us back together.
Ding-dong.
I don't know what tom told you,but he came on to me.
I'm sorry. I didn't quite catch that.
Why don't you just come on over here and say that to me again?
Stay away from me.
I have been trying to stay away from you...
mom?
Everything's all right,so you can just go
back into your room and play.
kayla! Don't move.
Okay. Never mind.
I'm leaving.
First,I'm just gonna giveour mom a hug.
Your association with my family is over.
When kayla comes to visit,you will drop
her at the end of the block.
You will never again see my husband,and if you try to,
I will do to your spine what I just did to your front door.
Nod if you understand.
and you,I'm gonna see you on saturday,right?
Don't forget your swimsuit.
Good morning! You're looking bright-eyed and...
bushy.
did you stay here all night?
Well,I slept on the sofa.
When I brought you home,you were still...
as you americans say... tossing your tacos.
please,keep the food references to a minimum.
Bless you.
So what else happened?
You don't remember?
Well,I'll tell you what...
I'll repeat what you said last night,
and you say whether it was you or
the booze talking. Are you ready?
You said you missed me. Susan or booze?
Susan.
You said it was a mistake breaking up
with me and that you wanted to start again.
Susan or booze?
Susan.
Then you said that you wanted to dress
me up like a schoolboy and spank my naughty bottom.
Susan or booze?
Oh,I didn't say that.
yeah,all right then,but if you had,um...
susan or booze?
A little of both,so... boozan.
detective ridley.
your jane doe in the morgue is named monique polier.
Who's this?
Just before she died,she was having an affair
with a man named harvey bigsby.
You got that?
Yeah. Uh,can I get your name?
I'll need to bring you in for a statement.
carlos,could you come help me?
I'm watching the game.
It'll just take a second. Please?
what,gaby?
You look... nice.
Oh,thanks. I'm gonna go meet some new friends for dinner.
But my zipper's stuck. Can you help me?
man,this is really stuck.
It's like somebody put superglue on it or something.
Weird.
Well,you know what? I don't wanna be late,
so I should probably change.
Oh,carlos,this old thing?
You've seen it all before.
I'm just gonna wear the little blue number.
Will you hand me those stockings?
Oh,I've got a raggedy nail.
you're gonna have to help me put those on.
Are you sure about that?
Well,I'd do it myself,but I don't wanna get a snag.
It's been a long time.
Really? It seems like yesterday to me.
You want me to help you hook that?
Sure.
Why not?
For old time's sake.
What about your new friends?
I've decided I'd rather catch up with an old one.
mr. Bigsby,detective ridley,homicide.
I understand you know her.
Uh,all right,yes,we were sleeping together.
Can we do this somewhere else?
Sure.
carlos,do you think we're making a mistake?
What do you mean?
The whole divorce thing.
Maybe we shouldn't go through with it.
It's not like we're gonna find this kind of
passion with anyone else.
Are you saying you wanna stay together?
Yeah,I guess I am.
Why don't we just put all of this behind us and
stay together? What do you say?
Oh,baby...
if you knew how long I waited to hear you say that...
well,what? What's so funny?
Oh,man.
I thought I'd be able to get through this
without cracking up,but you are just too funny.
there's a little something that I need to own up to.
I know that the only reason you slept
with me was because I got a w job.
You got a new job? Honey,that's wonderful!
Gaby,please. You were a model,not a model actress.
There is no job.
The contracts in my desk were fake. I mailed them to myself.
What?
Why would you do that?
Well,let's see...
you did this just to get me in bed?
no,I did it because I knew you'd smell
money and come crawling back.
Then I could turn you down and walk out on my own terms.
Your terms?
You don't get to screw around on me,take
my money and then walk away without a scratch.
I want you hurtin',baby,and judging by the look on your face
when you saw 2 million imaginary dollars disappear,
I succeeded.
You are a bastard!
Better a bastard than a whore.
oh,god!
Hello?Uh,there's been an
accident. My husband... he...
I'm gonna have to call you back.
carlos?
Honey?
Carlos?
Oh,yeah.
It's on.
there is a place in st. Timothy's church
where sinners go to confess their sins.
And once they're done,they expect absolution.
But the truth is,not all confessions are
worthy of such forgiveness.
Most who unveil hidden agendas deserve
the condemnation they receive.
Most who disclose vengeful motives merit
the punishment that follows.
Only the truly repentant have any right
at all to expect a second chance...
come on. What's my surprise?
I thought you'd never get here.
which is why it's best to think twice before you confess...
mike?
What's wrong?
That... that girl who died...
especially if you don't know what it is you're confessing to.
I think I knew her.
Previously on Desperate Housewives...
Nora looked for
trouble and found it...
You will never again
see my husband.
Julie got to know
Edie's nephew...
She couldn't take
her eyes off my abs.
I felt violated.
Susan and Ian made plans...
I'd love to go to
France someday.
Would you like to
go next month?
Gabrielle and Carlos reunited...
It's been a long time.
And dinner with the Bigsbys...
That's the police report that
Alma filed after Orson hit her.
Was full of surprises.
Look, I'm going
through something.
I had an affair.
FRIDAY
It was supposed to be an
ordinary day for Carolyn Bigsby.
She had planned to bake
her husband a strudel,
give her dog a bath
and water her african violets.
Yes, Carolyn had planned to do all
sorts of things she thought mattered.
But earlier that day,
a woman who wasn't her friend
told Carolyn something she
wasn't supposed to hear.
From that moment
on, Carolyn felt...
nothing really
mattered anymore.
Hello, Carolyn.
Yeah, hey, how are you?
Carolyn?
What are you doing here?
I've been thinking, Harvey, that if you
loved this Monique woman so much,
maybe you should be with her.
For God sakes,
Carolyn, she's dead.
Yeah, I know.
Yes, Carolyn Bigsby had planned
on it being an ordinary day...
Harvey!
You come out of there, damn it!
But as every housewife knows...
Down. Nobody goes anywhere.
Plans change.
THE NIGHT BEFORE
Lynette Scavo had
a dream last night.
It was one she'd had
many times before.
She dreamt of the last
time she saw me...
and of the last
time we spoke.
Hey!
Mary Alice, are you okay?
Yes, thank you.
I'm fine.
Okay. See you later.
It was still hard for
Lynette to accept
that this unremarkable
exchange had been our last.
Or that moments later,
I would enter my house,
and put a bullet
through my brain.
FRIDAY MORNING
I had the Mary Alice
dream again last night.
Oh, hon, again?
I haven't had it for months.
I don't know why it came back.
Well, somebody just bought her old
house. Maybe that triggered something.
It was awful, as always.
I saw she was in pain,
and I just walked away and...
There was nothing you could do.
And that's what I did, nothing.
Hey, is that the new neighbor?
Oh, he's cute!
Edie said he's a bachelor...
Keep talking.
Who lives with his invalid sister.
You can stop now.
Should we go introduce ourselves?
Yeah, let's give him the
scoop on the neighborhood.
Do you think he knows Mary Alice
shot herself in his living room?
Then again, he probably
wants some time to unpack.
Orson?
If you have a moment, there's
something I'd like your thoughts on.
Certainly.
What is it?
The menu for our
holiday open house?
No, it's the police report from the
night you beat your first wife.
I'm still working on the menu.
I assure you,
I did not beat my wife.
She suffered these
injuries in a fall.
Oh, how did she fall?
I pushed her.
It was self-defense.
She attacked me.
Why would she attack you?
She spilled some red
wine on a white tablecloth.
She was trying to clean
it up with dish soap.
When I pointed out her mistake, she
started screaming, "Shut up, shut up!"
And striking me repeatedly
with a saut pan.
Well, look...
The police dropped the charges.
Where did you get this?
Carolyn.
Well, of course.
Who else?
If she paid this much attention
to her own marriage, maybe
Harvey wouldn't
have cheated on her.
Harvey cheated?
Yes, with some flight
attendant named Monique.
Darling, I could never
strike a woman.
Well, you do believe
me, don't you?
All right, I accept
your explanation.
I just wish there were fewer
things for you to explain.
By the way, to remove a red wine
stain, you sprinkle salt to absorb it.
That's just what I was saying
to Alma when she clocked me.
Whoa, what fresh hell is this?
Hey, Tom...
Whoa!
Whoa, whoa!
You have stepped onto my property,
and you've talked to Tom.
That's two rules you've broken, and
I'm not sure that top doesn't make three.
Would you tell your lunatic
wife I'm not talking to her?
You're the lunatic if you think
I'm letting you anywhere
near my husband.
Just drop Kayla off and go.
Kayla won't be visiting today.
We're moving.
And here's where you can
send the child support.
Mexico?
An old friend of mine got me a sweet
job dancing at a nightclub in Tijuana.
Great, and you're taking Kayla?
Thank your wife.
She's been itching to get rid
of us ever since we got here.
She finally got her way.
Wave bye-bye to your Daddy, honey.
Nora, can't... can't we
just talk about this?
Oh, we're not allowed to talk.
Remember?
She's Tom's daughter. You can't
just take her out of the country.
Watch me.
Does either party have anything to add before
I rulon the division of assets and alimony?
No, we're confident that your ruling will reflect
the pain and suffering endured by my client.
Your honor, does the definition of "suffering"
encompass the seduction of my client four days ago?
Excuse me?
She thought he was coming into some money and hoped
to stall the divorce until she could claim her share.
How dare you!
That is a vicious lie.
Oh, Carlos, give it to me!
Carlos! Yes! Yes!
Carlos...
You recorded our lovemaking?
It's all right here, your honor.
When she climaxes, she actually
starts screaming out dollar amounts.
Mrs. Solis...
Would you like to respond?
As a matter of fact,
I do have a few thoughts.
Carlos, you're a dead man!
Do you hear me?
Oh, the ruling seems fair
to me. You get the house.
I just get everything in it.
I said dead!
No alimony.
That's a drag.
But, hey, you like
to work, right?
Come on, just give me one clean shot
at him. I'm willing to do the time!
Mom, I was packing your suitcase,
and you're totally out of toothpaste.
Do you want me to go to
the store and get some?
What is this?
Oh, um, it was Austin's, okay?
Edie's nephew? Since when
are you friends with him?
Uh, we are not friends. I was
tutoring him, he brought beer,
I told him to throw it out,
and he did. End of story.
Did you have any?
Oh, I cannot believe your timing.
I'm about to fly off to Paris, and you're
inviting boys over for oktoberfest.
Oh, that's it! Go to your room and finish
packing. This conversation's over.
The last time I checked,
I was the parent.
Yeah, well, the last time I checked, I was the
daughter who never gave you any reason to doubt her.
Okay, I know I...
And don't play the parent card with me.
I just finished packing your suitcase, doing
your laundry and balancing your checkbook.
And now I'm going to the
store to buy your toothpaste.
Well, a simple "No, I didn't
drink any beer" would've sufficed.
Bree!
You haven't returned any of my calls.
I've been worried.
Have you told the wife-beater
you're leaving him yet?
Sorry, no.
Turns out he has an explanation
for the police report.
Oh, come on. There's never
a good reason for hitting a woman.
I used to think that, too.
Then I met you.
Good day.
I'm trying to help you.
You're living in a fool's paradise.
Well, I guess that
makes us neighbors.
What's that supposed to mean?
It means you should stop worrying about my
marriage and start worrying about your own.
don't play coy with me.
You've got something
to say, then just say it.
Okay. Does the name Monique
mean anything to you?
Hey, I found this site that offers
really cheap fares to Tijuana,
but should I even be thinking
of going to Tijuana?
It's fine with me...
Soon as you figure out a way
to leave your genitals here.
What are you saying, Lynette? I'm not
allowed to visit my daughter? What?
See? This is exactly
what she wants.
She takes Kayla,
and I get blamed.
Well, screw her.
Let's sue for custody.
Full custody?
You'd go for that?
You bet I woul'd.
Kayla will be much better off
without Crazy in her life.
So will we.
I am right there with you.
I just... I never thought
you'd want a fifth kid.
I don't, but I didn't want the first four,
and they're starting to grow on me.
Hey, look whose plastic
handcuffs got taken off.
Okay, you' clearly still a little
miffed about the settlement.
But come on, be fair.
I did buy most of the stuff
in this house, honey.
What the hell are you doing?!
Oh, I'm helping you pack.
Think of all the money you're
gonna save on bubble wrap.
Do you know how
much that was worth?!
Do you know how
much I was worth?!
When we met, I was
on the coverf magazines.
I had a career and a future,
but I gave it all up for you,
and what did I get in return?
If you break one more
thing, so help me...
What? What are you gonna do?
Carlos, have you lost your mind?!
Well, you're helping
me pack my stuff.
I'm helping you
remodel your house.
You know, I don't
know about you,
but I always thought there should
be a window that was right there.
We can stop this right now,
or we can keep on playing.
Your call.
Toothpaste, mouthwash...
Did somebody get an anonymous e-mail?
Said the boy with the
economy-sized acne cream.
There you go again,
checking out my basket.
Ugh, go away. Do you know how much
trouble your stupid beer can got me in?
Well, then let me make it up
to you. I'll carry your stuff.
Whatever.
Yeah?
Harvey, it's me.
Hey, hon, I'm in the middle
of something here, so, um...
I know about Monique.
Um, could you excuse me a second?
Look, I don't know who you've
been talking to, but, um...
Did you love her?
She was just a friend, and she
disappeared eight months ago.
The police just found her body.
Eight months ago. That's right when
you fell into that big depression.
And I kept thinking,
"Why is Harvey so blue?
How do I cheer him up?"
That was about her, wasn't it?
It's over.
She's dead.
But if she weren't,
who would you be
with, me or her?
She's dead.
That'll be $12.99.
I'll take your fields card.
Couldn't keep your
wallet in your pants?
Mr. Bigsby?
Look, um...
I gotta go.
Mommy, look at us!
I'll look as soon as I get
back from the store.
Bye, mom!
This is Edie.
Yeah, I'm his aunt.
He shoplifted what?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Be right there.
You're still packing?
We're going to be late.
Nope, we're fine. Besides, I can't leave
until Julie gets back with my toothpaste.
Oh, we don't need it. I packed
a large tube and some dental floss.
Really?
why are americans so amazed when the english display
the slightest acquaintance with dental hygiene?
Okay, I'm gonna need some
help with this big baby.
Go! Zip, zip, zip!
Uh, Susan, do you really need all this?
I mean, we're not emigrating.
It's my first time in Paris.
I want it to be magical,
and that means
accessories, so back off.
It's the fashion capital of the world.
Uh, while I'm working, you can take
my credit card and buy some new things.
No, no, I am not gonna
spend your money.
I have an expense account.
And you just tell me this now?
I'll tell the driver
you'll be a minute.
Hello?
Yes, this is her mother.
What?
Well, you're gonna
love the neighborhood.
Are you all moved in?
Uh, pretty much. Just waiting on
some medical equipment for my sister.
Oh, yeah, I heard she isn't well.
Can I ask what's wrong with her?
Oh, of course. Unfortunately,
she has this rare degenerative...
Oh, that's rough.
Excuse me.
You told me you weren't even friends with
him. Now you're shoplifting together?
Mom, you know I wouldn't steal.
Yeah, I wanna believe that,
but suddenly you're having
boys over, you're drinking beer...
And soon she'll be listening to that rock
'n' roll music everybody's talking about.
So how are we gonna handle this?
Listen, I have somebody in
the car who's late for a plane.
Can you give me two minutes?
Mom...
I am so disappointed in you.
Hello, Carolyn.
Yeah, hey, how are you?
Look, make him work it off.
You get a free stock boy for a month.
A month?
It was a $10 bottle of whiskey.
Exactly. You weren't even smart
enough to steal the good stuff.
Harvey, don't walk away.
Come on.
Let's sort this out.
Hey, Nora.
How's tricks?
I thought it was your
car I saw in the lot.
You're a conniving bitch.
Ah, I see you've
heard from our lawyer.
So it's not enough that
you run me out of town.
You gotta steal my damn kid.
Carolyn, what are
you doing here?
I've been thinking, Harvey, that if you
loved this Monique woman so much...
Even you have to admit
Kayla would be better off
with us than in a dingy apartment
over a Tijuana strip club.
Believe me, Lynette, you
do not wanna screw with me.
You went after my husband.
If anyone should be afraid, it's you.
Go!
Go!
Harvey!
Harvey, you come
out of there, damn it!
Down.
Everybody down.
Nobody goes anywhere.
Don't move.
Get down.
You can't be serious.
We have tickets.
The plane leaves in two hours.
I'm sorry. I know, Julie
picked a lousy time to rebel.
I just can't fly off
and ignore it.
You're overreacting.
It's an adolescent prank,
and you're turning it into
some great bloody crisis.
You have a lot of
meetings anyway.
Wel go some other time.
I can't leave Julie right now.
We'll take her with us.
Oh, that's responsible parenting.
Stealing whiskey?
"That's it, young lady.
I'm taking you to Paris. "
Ah, ah, but that's just some ruse.
Once we get her on the plane, we'll make
her fly coach-middle seat, no mercy.
I'm sorry.
It won't be Paris without you.
What the hell's going on?
It's Mrs. Bigsby.
She has a gun.
What?
I said nobody move!
She's at the back.
I think we can make it.
Hey!
Attention, shoppers, wee having
a special today on not getting shot,
but it's only available
at the back of the store!
Hey, how are ya?
Thanks for joining us.
Do I know you?
My son Jordan's in your
Sunday school class.
Oh, he's a great little boy,
so don't do anything that'll make him
wake up tomorrow without a Mommy.
Um, for the rest of
you, hi, I'm Carolyn.
I'm sorry for putting
a crimp in your day,
but I'm pretty sure that my cheating husband
is in re right now phoning the police,
so I'm counting on all you folks to help me keep
them oside till Harvey and I have a chance to...
talk things over.
Harvey!
You're inconveniencing your customers.
Get out here!
Yeah, she's got hostages!
Oh, my God.
Austin's there, and Julie!
Get your ass out there
before someone gets hurt!
What am I, a moron?
She'll shoot me.
She has got ten innocent
people out there.
Sometimes you've got
to take one for the team.
Sweetie, it's Mommy.
I need to talk to Daddy.
Porter's hogging all the legos.
Tell him I said to share.
Now put Daddy on.
I did tell them,
but he says he needs
them all for his robot.
Put Daddy on, and
I'll buy you a real robot.
You will?
A big one with laser beam
eyes. Now go get Daddy!
I'm getting a real robot!
A real robot?
Come on, that's not fair.
I'm having a real bad day here.
Is a little cooperation
too much to ask?
Lynette?
Lynette?
It's terrible. Terrible.
Excuse me, what's going...
what's going on?
Crazy woman with
a gun in there!
No, no, no! Stay back!
Carolyn! Open up!
My daughter's inside!
Sorry, store's closed.
Yeah, but there's a crazy
woman in there!
Yeah, I know.
Quick, turn on the TV.
It's kinda on the fritz.
Well, turn on your radio.
If only you'd come
ten minutes earlier.
Some woman is shooting up
fields market. She's got hostages.
Oh, my God!
Yeah, we're all watching it
over at Bree's house, and...
Uh, is everything okay here?
Yeah, everything's fine.
Having a little squabble.
Give us a minute.
Carlos, where do you think
you're going with that?!
Information is very
thin at this time.
We do not see anybody in the front
of the building at this hour but...
Coffee's almost ready, and if you'd prefer to
watch the coverage on channel 9, it's on in the den.
Orson, Greta needs a coaster.
Bree, have you heard?
Oh, it's just awful. Deviled egg?
Oh, thank you.
I told you she'd have food.
I'm sure some of you might be
thinking that this is all my fault,
and that I'm the bad guy
here, but I'm not. He is.
Will you people stop calling me?
I'm right in the middle of something.
He humiliated me.
First he cheated on me with
a stewardess named Monique.
How clich is that?
And then he told people about it.
Now there are news
trucks out there.
Judy Pope's husband has
an affair, nobody finds out.
Mine cheats, and they
break into programming!
The whole town is laughing at me!
You hear that, Harvey?
I only told one person.
Well, it was clearly the wrong one.
I told you to stop calling me-
Tish, I'm sorry. I thought
it was somebody else.
Oh, my God, was that
today? I'm so sorry.
I know, Tish.
Yeah, I know.
I know I volunteered
for the winter fair...
How can you look so calm?
Aren't you scared?
No, because I'm not
gonna die today...
and neither are you.
Tish, I really don't
think that I can.
I'm telling you, um...
Oh, Tish, for God sakes,
turn on your damn TV!
Excuse me,
my name is Susan Mayer.
Ma'am, this is a restricted area.
I would like to trade places
with one of the people inside.
Don't... don't you do that?
Oh, you mean our hostage
exchange program?
Okay, you don't have to be nasty.
My daughter is inside there.
Ma'am, we're doing everything
we can to get her out safely.
Now please step back.
I want the perimeter locked down.
Nobody goes in, nobody goes out,
and see if you can get me an open
phone line with the manager's office.
Attention! Attention, Carolyn Bigsby!
Where's that coming from?
This is Susan Mayer... again.
First of all, I'm sorry for
the "crazy lady" remark.
Second, I have a proposition for you.
Find her now!
Let Julie go and take me instead.
Repeat, take me.
I will be a model hostage.
If we have a deal,
signal by sending Julie to the...
No, take your hands off me!
Carolyn, Carolyn!
Call my cell! It's 572...
Now we don't know where anyone
is inside the building right now,
but we are standing by,
waiting for information.
I'm hoping to talk to the chief of
police in just a couple of minutes,
get a few more details...
Andrew, honey, would
you please get the phone?
Police have just released the
name of the hostage taker.
It's Carolyn Bigsby, wife of
store owner Harvey Bigsby.
Harvey has informed police that
he is barricaded inside the store...
Oh, my God, Bree, don't you ow her?
Uh, yes, um...
I just... ran into
her this morning.
Uh, mom?
That was Edie Britt on the phone.
She's inside the market.
Is she all right?
Yeah, uh, she's locked
inside the manager's office,
but she said that Julie Mayer and
Mrs. Scavo are with the hostages.
Bree, would you mind watching the kids?
I've got a doctor's appointment,
and Lynette is taking her
sweet time at the market.
I'm sorry. Are you guys having a party?
we continue to report live on
the scene as the hostage standoff
at fields market enters its third hour.
According to a police spokesman,
there has been no further
contact from the hostage taker.
We continue to wait for
the latest information.
No new news at this point.
We will bring you the latest as
soon as it becomes available.
Are you all right?
I'm fine.
I just, I'm running out of food, and it's
not as if I can go to the ocery store.
Bree...
Thank God I found this stale
baguette so I can make bruschetta,
and there's shrimp in the freezer,
so I'm gonna make my
rice and seafood dish.
Bree, this is not your fault.
I had toell her.
She hurt me,
so I hurt her back.
If anything should happen
to Julie or Lynette...
Is there anything I can do?
You can peel a clove of garlic.
Okay.
I wanted kids.
I wanted kids so badly but
Harvey had two
from his first wife.
He said it made her fat.
Harvey likes them lean.
I run four miles a day.
This is my first
cookie in six years.
You hear that, Harvey?
I'm breaking my diet!
She's starting to lose it
out there. What do I do?
Just keep her calm,
tell her you're sorry,
and see if you can get her to
release the kids and old people.
Okay, I'll try.
Carolyn...
Honey, uh, it's me, Harvey.
Look, I'really sorry.
What I did was wrong,
but I still love you a lot.
Cut the crap.
I had my hair done this
morning. Did you notice?
Did you even notice?
Well, I was distracted.
You were shooting at me.
Tell her let the kids go.
Who the hell was that?!
You got a woman in there?
She's a customer!
Don't lie to me, Harvey!
She's another one of
your whores, isn't she?
Oh, fantastic!
Carolyn, I swear...
shut up.
I hope you're having a good
time in there, whore,
'cause I got a bullet for you, too.
God, what a nightmare.
You know what the weird part is?
What?
I keep thinking about that
crazy lady in the market, and...
I understand her.
I could be her.
Come on.
No, I mean it.
The rage that I have felt
in these past six months...
If I had had a gun in
the courthouse today...
you could never shoot me.
I don't know what
I'm capable of anymore.
This divorce has
turned me into this...
bitter, hateful person,
and I don't like her.
Hey, baby.
And for what it's worth, I don't like
what it's turned you into either.
Then let's stop
being those people.
Okay.
Okay.
Hey, just so you know...
I heard the woman in there
teaches Sunday school.
A Sunday school teacher
would never hurt a kid.
No way.
Thank you.
I'm sure Lynette's
gonna be fine, too.
Oh, I'm not worried
about Lynette.
Hell, with Lynette in there,
they don't even need that negotiator.
You put Lynette in a room with a woman
who wants to shoot her husband,
she'll have them renewing their vows.
Right.
Lynette is very persuasive.
I give it an hour, tops.
Then we'll all be back home
eating our hamburgers.
She was gonna go to
the store tomorrow,
but we were out of hamburger.
I wanted hamburgers.
I hope all this is giving you
a little perspective on our situation.
Shh! She told us not to talk.
You're thinking about
your kids, right?
How awful it'd be to
never see them again.
Well, that's what you're asking me
to feel, but for the rest of my life!
Nora, please!
Hey, what'd I say?
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
We'll... we'll be quiet.
You and your friend are
really startinto bug me.
She's not my friend.
She's trying to steal my kid.
Nora, shut up!
Is that true?
No! I... we're...
We have... We're sharing
custody, and then,
she tried to
seduce my husband, so...
She put the moves
on your husband?
Why didn't you say so?
That was a shot! We just heard
a shot fired inside the building.
A shot has been fired.
I believe the phrase you're
looking for is "thank you".
We just had a shot. We heard a
shot fired inside the market.
You can see police are responding,
taking this very seriously.
We are going to just continue to stand
and watch and wait and see what happens.
It was on television at the airport.
I came as soon as I could.
The last thing I said to her
was that she disappointed me.
Police have just confirmed
that a hostage has been shot.
Repeat, a hostage has been shot.
There's no word on the name of the victim
at this time, but it is believed to be female.
Mrs. Hodge?
When's mommy gonna
be back from the store?
I'm sure she'll be back soon.
Why don't we, uh, go have some cookies?
Mommy said we can't have
cookies before dinner.
I'm sure she won't mind. Come on.
Let's go. Come on.
Okay, I gotta keep the pressure
up to stop the bleeding!
Good news is you won't
need that lawyer now.
You are gonna get
through this just fine.
There is a parking lot full
of ambulances out there.
You gotta let us take
her out of here!
No one's leaving.
Listen to me... Lynette...
About Kayla...
Oh, forget it! Forget it!
We'll work that out later.
No...
I don't have... have
later, you stupid bitch.
Okay? So listen.
Okay, I'm listening.
Kayla's the only good thing that
I've ever done in my whole life.
I need you to really take
really good care... of her.
Okay?
I don't have all day. Come on.
Yeah, yes, I will, I will, I will.
I will love her like she
is my own. I will, Nora.
Nora?
Nora!
Oh, don't look at me that way.
You know you wanted her dead.
How can you say that?
Well, you told me about her and your husband after
I made it pretty clear where I stand on whores.
I did not want this.
Don't you dare say
that I wanted this.
Shut up!
No, I will not shut up!
What's the matter with you?!
Have you not been paying attention?
My husband cheated on me!
Who cares?!
Who cares? We all have pain!
Everyone in here has pain,
but we deal with it!
We swallow it and get
going with our lives!
What we don't do is go
around shooting strangers!
She deserved it!
Well, maybe you deserved
to be cheated on!
I'm.. I'm... I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have said that.
Yeah, you shouldn't have.

Lynette Scavo had
a dream that night.
It was one she'd had
many times before.
Hey!
Mary alice, are you okay?
Yes, thank you.
I'm fine.
Okay. I'll see you later.
But this night,
something changed.
No, you're not. I can tell.
Please...
Tell me what's wrong.
Let me save you.
You can't.
Why not?
Sweetie, we can't prevent
what we can't predict.
Isn't there anything I can do?
Yes.
You can enjoy this beautiful day.
We get so few of them.
This was the last time Lynette
would ever dream of me,
and for her sake,
I am grateful.
Previously on Desperate Housewives...
The new neighbor...
He's cute.
He's a bachelor.
Became a hero.
In a crisis that brought
Julie and Austin together,
while Carlos and
Gaby broke apart.
I had a career and a future,
but I gave it all up for you,
and what did I get in return?
The police assembled
their pieces of evidence.
Your phone number was
written on her hand.
I can't help you.
No memory, huh?
That's convenient.
Karen McCluskey had always
believed in helping others,
whether they wanted
her help or not.
What's all this?
You know how you never got around
to painting your garage door?
Well, it's done.
Hope you like blue.
Baxter!
You found him!
Yeah, and I got him
neutered, too.
I figured you wouldn't want
any more strays around here.
Karen!
Hi, Alberta.
I took these down for you since, you
know, Christmas was six months ago.
Yes, Mrs. McCluskey's helping hand
was known throughout Wisteria Lane.
But on this day, it was
about to get slapped.
What the hell
are you doing?
Jeez, Edie, you scared me.
What are you doing here?
Getting Mike's house ready. He comes
back from the hospital tomorrow.
Since when do you have
a key to his garage?
He gave me one...
in case of an emergency.
Don't lie to me, prune.
Fine, I found it under his mat.
Look, I'm not doing
anything wrong.
I just come over once a week and start
his mower so the engine doesn't get rusty.
And do you mow your
lawn with it, too?
What's the big deal?
I'm doing him a favor.
Well, he doesn't need
any favors from you.
I'm gonna go through
Mike's house room by room,
and if I find as much as one paper
clip missing, I'm calling the cops.
Funny you should talk
about stuff that's missing.
I found those pictures of Mike
and Susan you threw out.
Pictures?
Oh, don't act for me.
I know that Mike's been having
troubles with his memory.
My guess...
You don't want him to remember how
crazy he was about his old girlfriend.
I don't need to resort to
deception to land a man.
Oh, Edie,
I saved the pictures...
And I can show them
to Mike anytime I like.
Yes, Karen McCluskey
believed in helping others...
Where are you
going with this?
Which she felt gave
her the right...
To help herself.

So remember
to be polite...
Each year as part of
their fund-raising drive,
the Fairview adventure scouts
would award a shiny new bike
to whoever sold the most
magazine subscriptions.
And each scout would set out utterly
convinced the prize would be hers.
That's the beauty of youth.
Little girls believe
anything is possible...
That is, until they grow
up anget divorced.
Hi.
What if I told you there is a
way you could help children,
while also reading your favorite
magazines at a reduced price?
Would you like
to hear more?
Sure, knock yourself out.
Wise choice.
For the lady of the
house, we offer...
Redbook, Glamour,
"Vog-you"...
I think you mean
Vogue, sweetie.
You sure?
I should know.
I was on the cover.
No way.
Uh, way.
Oh, see that coat I'm wearing in
this shot? That's genuine ocelot fur.
Although the photographer was the real
animal, if you know what I'm saying...
Which I hope you don't.
And don't ever
do drugs, okay?
Being a model must
be so amazing.
Why did you stop?
Well, I fell in love,
got married and moved
to the suburbs for the
whole fairy-tale
happy ending thing.
That was a crock.
So you going back
to modeling?
No. No, no, no,
no, no, no.
Why not?
What else are
you gonna do?
You're going back to modeling?
This is so sudden.
Well, let's not get
ahead of ourselves.
I'm just gonna fly to New York, meet with
my old agent and take it from there.
Come on, you guys, this is
exciting. Be happy for me.
We are. We're just gonna
miss you, that's all.
Well, now that my divorce is final,
I need a reason to wake up in the morning.
I have this hole in my life that
can't be filled by shopping.
That's right, I said it.
Oh, my Gosh.
Lynette.
I'll get the kids.
They're dying to see you.
Hey.
Hey!
Oh, my Gosh!
You didn't have
to do this!
Hi!
You look great.
Well, apparently, taking a. 38 slug
to the shoulder agrees with you.
Yeah, um, listen, about that...
The kids don't know what happened.
They don't?
I thought they were little young to
deal with their mother getting shot.
All I told them is Kayla is
staying with her grandmother,
and I made up a story
about how I got hurt.
Hey, Mom!
Oh, here they are!
Hey!
Mommy!
Hello. Oh, this side. Hi!
Hello!
I can't believe you got
in a fight with a hobo.
Yeah...
Well, let's see how well you
do on a morphine drip.
Mommy, come inside. We helped Mrs.
McCluskey make your favorite lunch.
Fantastic! Lead the
way, I'm coming in.
Hurry up. I'm hungry.
Let's go. Let's go.
There she is!
Hi, my little bunny!
Hey, why don't you go inside
and get the party started?
I've gotta... Okay?
Gotcha.
Hi, bunny. I'll be right there.
Hey.
Hey, Lynette!
Uh, yeah.
You're home.
Yeah.
How you doing?
I'm good.
I just...
How do I...
Thank the man
who saved my life?
You don't have
to say anything.
I'm gonna make
you a cake.
A cake?
Yeah.
I never make cakes.
This is huge.
In that case...
Thanks.
Yeah, I'm gonna
make you a cake.
Christmas carols?
It's not even Thanksgiving.
I'm starting my cards
early this year.
It puts me in the mood
to spread holiday cheer.
And with the pack of lies in this family
newsletter, she spreads holiday denial.
Andrew, it's etiquette. Nobody wants
to read the truth at Christmas.
Well said, darling.
Honey, would you put on another CD?
Something with sleigh bells.
Oh, by the way, Orson, I need your
mother's address at the nursing home.
Oh, well, I appreciate the thought,
darling, but you needn't send her a card.
Oh, don't be silly. I'm sending one
to the man who reads our gas meter.
I can certainly send
one to your mother.
She's completely senile. She'll
only try to dunk it in her coffee.
Well, all the more
reason to send her one.
Let the nurses know that she has
family at home who loves her...
and who could drop by at any minute
and slap them with a lawsuit.
Bree, I hear what
you're saying-
Orson, what's the big deal?
It's just an address.
Fine.
I'll get my book.
The home is somewhere
over in Lakeview.
Lakeview?
Oh, you gave me the impression
that she was back east.
Well, that's because, frankly,
I wanted to avoid this conversation.
But if she's only 30 minutes away,
why haven't you been visiting her?
Okay, the truth is...
It breaks my heart
to see her now.
I want to remember
her as she was.
But, Orson...
Bree,
I refuse to sit in a room that smells
of disinfectant and lime Jell-O,
making small talk with a woman
who doesn't remember me.
Now let it go, damn it.
But by all means,
do send a card.
The elves will tickle her.
Well, shall we?
Wait.
Julie's gonna know we came home early
from the restaurant to check up on her.
I don't want her to think
I'm overprotective and clingy.
The girl was held hostage. It's only
natural you're gonna be a little bit clingy.
Yeah, it's been a week.
I'm getting on her nerves.
How about this?
We came home early because
we hated the restaurant.
The service was dreadful,
and the lobster was inedible.
Okay.
Wait, if we hated the restaurant,
then why are we bringing home food?
Good point.
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
Are you kidding?!
That's lobster!
Okay, I thought the
restaurant was fantastic,
and you were the fussy snob
who was impossible to please.
Why do I have to
be the fussy snob?
Because you're british.
Fine.
But I trust you'll make
it up to me later
by doing the things a gentleman
expects when he's sprung for lobster.
I'm not getting any
tonight, am I?
You're supposed to
be having dinner!
It's my fault. I found the
restaurant to be absolutely...
Oh, let it go. We came home because I was
worried about you, and with good reason.
You, put on your
shirt and get out.
Well, I didn't bring a shirt.
See, I was out running and...
Who cares?! Go!
How could you
treat him like that?
If Austin hadn't been in that
supermarket, I might not be here.
Yes, and I am grateful, but I found a way
to say "thank you" without taking my top off.
A couple of buttons came undone.
It's not like my boobs were out.
Okay, well, it's, uh, it's
getting late and I really...
No, Ian, am I overreacting here?
Well, I can understand on the heels of a crisis,
two people might bondand find themselves...
You're a very naughty girl!
Julie, that boy
drinks, he steals,
and now I find him mauling
you on my couch? That's it.
I forbid you to see him.
You can't do that.
I choose who I date.
Yeah? Well, I choose to
ground you. Two weeks, baby.
Fine, I'll just see
him at school.
Well, then you won't go to
school. I'll homeschool you.
Right, you're gonna teach me trig?
You can't even balance your own checkbook.
Yes, and you will be poorly educated,
and you won't get into college,
and you will work for minimum wage for
the rest of your life, all because of that boy!
I hope you're happy!
Mom, I like this guy, and I'm
sorry if it makes you unhappy,
but I'm going to
keep seeing him.
Doesn't the place look great?
I came in and straightened up.
I wanted everything
to look nice for you.
You okay?
Yeah. Yeah, it's just that...
I'm home, but it doesn't
really feel like home.
It will. Give it time.
The important thing is that
you're back from the hospital,
and every day
you're getting better.
Hey, the worst is behind you.
I need the Delfino
search warrant.
We're not gonna get it
without proble cause.
The guy's phone number was
written on a dead girl's hand.
The judge is gonna need more.
I thought you might say that.
Here's Monique Polier's lab work.
The infrared spectroscopy
matched paint fragments
in the head wound to the
proximo line of pipe wrenches.
They're high-end, only used
by professional plumbers.
And guess what our boy
Delfino does for a living?
I'll see what I can do.
What do you mean
you can't shoot her?
Francesco, if you can airbrush her acne,
you can airbrush the track marks.
Now don't call me
again unless she O.D.S.
Gabrielle, ma petite fille!
Oh, sit!
You look amazing,
younger than ever!
It's my new dermal filler.
It's banned here, so my assistant
smuggles it in from Brazil.
Isn't it fun? I have
my own drug mule.
That's great!
Well, I have some
fun news of my own.
I'm ready to model again.
Really?
The last time we spoke,
you couldn't wait to quit.
You were giving
it all up for love.
What happened
to prince charming?
Divorce.
Oh, single again?
Isn't that ironic, since
I'm the one you called...
How did you put it?
A "career-obsessed lesbo who would
die alone and be eaten by her cats. "
Did I say that?
Water under the bridge.
I thought it was funny.
It's even funnier now.
Look, Marcella, I'm back.
And we made such a great team
before, and I think we can be again.
I don't know, darling.
Things are different now.
You're not gonna be able to jump
right back in where you left off.
Well, I just wanna work.
Boy, I'm still not sure.
You know what might help?
If you groveled.
Are you serious?
Well, I can't tell because your
face doesn't move anymore.
No, I'm joking!
Welcome back, darling!
Hi.
Thank you.
Well, hello there!
How pretty you look today!
It's wonderful that
you're up and about!
You must be enjoying
these colorful balloons!
Why are you talking to
me like I'm a moron?
Oh, I'm...
I'm so sorry.
The nurse pointed me over here.
I'm looking for Gloria Hodge.
I'm Gloria Hodge.
Who might you be?
Well, I must say, I'm surprised
at how lucid you are.
Orson led me to believe...
That I was in the final
stages of dementia?
No, I'm afraid that's just
wishful thinking on his part.
Well, how can he feel that
way? You're his mother.
I wouldn't judge
him too harshly.
Ours is a...
complicated relationship.
There is love,
to be sure,
but we have a way of
disappointing each other.
Well, how does
he disappoint you?
He's cold, rigid...
And...
And utterly incapable
of letting go of the past.
And how do you
disappoint him?
I refuse to die.
Yes, I see. Well, surely
this rift isn't irreparable.
Do you know how people in nursing
homes spend their days, Bree?
They think about the past,
and all the things they'd do
differently if they had the chance.
Please tell Orson
that I'm sorry,
And in spite of everything,
I still love him.
Well, I have a better idea.
Why don't you tell him yourself?
That would be great.
I really appreciate it.
Okay. Thank you.
So what did Ted say? When do
you have to go back to work?
He said take as much
time as I want with pay.
You should get gunned
down more often.
Hey, there they are!
Hey, guys!
How was school?
Mommy, were you shot?
Shot? Where did
you hear that?
Jordan Blackwelder.
That's the same little creep
who tried to ruin Santa Claus!
And he said that the same crazy lady
that shot you killed auntie Nora dead.
It was on the news
and everything.
Okay, listen, kids.
I am sorry.
We shouldn't have lied, but sometimes parents
wanna protect the kids fromcary things.
And look, the good news is,
Mommy's fine now.
And we'll all see auntie
Nora again in heaven.
Or wherever.
Did they let you
keep the bullet?
No, no, afraid not.
That blows. We wanted to
bring it for show-and-tell.
Hey, sweetheart, you okay?
What if the crazy
lady comes back?
She won't.
How do you know?
Well, because she's...
Up in heaven
with auntie Nora.
Or wherever.
Julie Mayer, you get back here!
You're grounded, remember?!
Edie Britt, I wanna talk to you.
I just survived a hostage situation.
Haven't I suffered
enough for one week?
You keep your nephew away
from my daughter or else.
Look, I don't like it either,
but the harder we try
to keep them apart,
the more they're gonna
fight to be together.
Just let it run its course.
Are you crazy?!
If we don't do something,
those two could end up having sex!
"Could"?
Oh, my God.
You don't...
Let me put it this way-
I got a box of condoms
in my dresser.
Eleven are gone.
Can only account
for eight of 'em.
How can you be so
calm about this?
Edie?
Yeah?
Can you help me
with this tie? I...
Hey.
Mike...
You're out of the hospital.
Yeah. He's home.
In fact, we're gonna go
out and celebrate tonight.
I'll be with you in one
sec, okay, babe?
Yeah.
Since you asked,
I'm calm because I know if two
people are meant to be together,
there's nothing anyone
can do about it.
Okay, I should be back at around 6:00.
They can have one snack.
Try and push apples,
but if they threaten violence,
I have an emergency
candy bar under the sink.
Not anymore you don't.
Oh, jeez.
Mommy?
Where are you going?
To the market.
No!
Hey, sweetie,
it's a different market.
You're gonna get shot again.
No, I won't.
Lots of mommies go to the
store every day, and they're fine.
It's really not a scary place.
You went to the store, and you
got shot, and auntie Nora died.
I'm only gonna be in there
ten minutes, I promise.
Can't she go?
Fine. I'll go.
Thanks.
Don't give a hoot if
I get shot, do ya, kid?
You must be Tanya.
I'm Gabrielle. We're gonna
be co-models today.
Now I don't know if you've ever done one of
these big shoots before, but don't be nervous.
Durkin and I are old friends.
He's a sweetheart.
Now just remember, he's the king, do
exactly what he says, and you'll be fine.
I've been modeling
for two years,
I've done six magazine covers,
and I'm sleeping with Durkin.
Well, I guess you're
all set then.
I've got some wardrobe choices.
I want to be buried
in this dress!
This is for Tanya.
The "Mom" stuff is at the end.
"Mom"?
Okay, luv, let's get
the blood pumping!
The concept is "lock
up your daughters".
Okay? Get to work, everybody.
Tanya, I want you to hover down here
on the lawn, looking absolutely delicio.
Thank you very much.
And up here on the porch, Mom
and Dad looking all scandalized.
Excuse me, Durkin?
Yes, luv?
It's Gaby.
Gabrielle Marquez.
You shot me in Milan, remember?
Yes! Yes!
Lovely to see you again.
Did you have a question then?
I do.
Aren't you a little worried
that I'm gonna pull focus?
I mean, it's a little confusing.
People are gonna see Tanya,
and then they're gonna...
See that guy, and they're
gonna wonder who I am.
You're the Mum.
People aren't gonna buy that,
so here's what I was thinking.
I slap on one of those gowns,
I play Tanya's "big sister",
home from college
to raise a little help.
And we're gonna cram all
that on a subtitle, are we?
I'm sorry. Is just,
this outfit is hideous!
Just make it work.
Fine.
I just need a moment
to get into character.
Gabrielle, what's the holdup?
We've got to get moving here.
Ready, ready!
What's that?
Oh, I made it work.
I'm "hot Mom".
Get me her agent.
Before we begin, would either of you like
some cookies, milk, lemonade, perhaps?
Mom, why are we here?
Ah, cutting to the chase.
I like it.
I have a confession to make.
This whole dating drama has
been keeping me up at night,
and I hate being the
bitchy, naggy Mom.
When it comes to parenting, I am much
more comfortable playing the good cop.
Do you see where I'm
going with this, kids?
No.
Well, in that case.
Meet the bad cop.
Daddy!
Hey, baby girl.
That the guy?
Yep!
Get him.
This is so unfair.
Look, you defied my wishes,
you broke my rules.
Did you really think I was just
gonna throw in the towel?
Face it. I outsmarted you.
Who's Ian?
What?
You're dating some
british guy named Ian.
How did that come up?
I'm sorry. I didn't realize
it was a big secret.
You know, when you said it was
true love with you and the plumber,
I was a good guy.
I stepped aside, and now
you're on to someone else.
Big picture, Karl. His hand
up our daughter's shirt.
Don't change the subject!
That is the subject!
How serious is it
with this Ian guy?
I don't know!
It's complicated.
Yeah, he's kind of married.
He's what?
It's not what you think.
Well, in her defense,
his wife is in a coma.
All right, that's it!
All right, I forbid
you to see this guy!
What?
No! I don't take
orders from you!
Mom has a point, Dad.
You can't tell a woman who
she can and can't date.
It's her choice.
Exactly. Thank you.
Wait, no, that does
not apply to you.
You know, if you don't
care about my feelings,
I don't know what
I'm doing here.
Your feelings?
My God, you are the
worst bad cop ever!
Go to your room.
Not you!
Get back here!
You're under arrest!
No, I'm not!
Hey, buddy, you've been
reading comic books for a while.
Don't you wanna
go and play?
No, I wanna stay with you.
Yeah?
Okay.
Hey, Art.
Oh, hey! How are ya?
Good, uh...
Listen, as if saving my life wasn't
enough, I have a little favor to ask.
Sure. What's up?
My kids are having
a hard time.
They're pretty freaked out by
that whole supermarket thing.
You're my hostage!
Keep moving, or I'll
blow your face off!
Okay, it's my turn.
Give me the gun.
Not so much them.
Right.
But my other son, Parker.
So. Back to the favor.
Hey, Parker.
I want you to meet
our new neighbor, Art.
He lives in the house
across the street.
His sister has the cool
wheelchair witthe joystick.
Hey there, Parker.
Hi.
In the daytime,
Art coaches swimming
at the rec center, but...
Please, I can tell
Parker? Please?
And compromise my secret identity?
No way, Mrs. Scavo. No way.
Secret identity?
Oh, great, now the
cat's out of the bag.
Oh, might as well tell him.
It's okay. You can
trust him, really.
Art is the one who saved
me at the supermarket.
He's sort of a superhero.
Give me a break.
It's true.
All right, if you're a superhero,
what's your name?
I'm...
Protector Man.
Because I protect
people from bad guys.
You don't believe
me, do you?
Okay.
I really shouldn't
do this, but...
Did you really
save my Mom?
I really did.
He really did.
That's why you don't
have to worry.
That's Protector Man's job.
Your job is to run and
play and have fun.
Okay?
Okay.
Okay.
Oh, my cousin
went to Purdue.
What the hell?
Delfino.
Nice to see you
up and about.
Here's our search warrant.
Search warrant?
Let me see that.
How we doing?
We couldn't find a toolbox.
The man's a plumber.
Keep looking.
Sir, I can't find a thing.
You tired?
You, come with me.
Marcella, look,
I don't know what
they told you,
but all I'm asking for is
a simple costume change.
You don't get to
pull diva crap.
Tanya gets away with
it because she's a star.
You are nothing.
Where do you get off
talking to me like that?
I shot 36 covers by
the time I was 20!
Well, you're 30 now.
When you make that
face, you look 35.
Do you know how many photographers
would die to work with me again?
Yeah. Zero.
I had to call in major favors
just to get you this job.
I don't believe that.
Well, you know
what I don't believe?
You gave up a brilliant career
to play house in the suburbs,
and the minute it falls apart, you come
back here expecting a homecoming parade.
Well, guess what, sweetie?
We've moved on.
Now get your polyester
ass over there,
and act like the pro
you used to be.
Beautiful, Tanya.
That's it. Chin up.
Fantastic!
Mother, hold the plate higher.
Beautiful, Tanya.
Oh, you are gorgeous!
Yes, girl! Lovely, lovely!
Hiya, Mike. Welcome home.
You remember me?
Yeah, I think so.
The corner house with
all the gnomes out front?
You're thinking
of Martha Huber.
Terrible story.
Someone beat her to death, and
then buried her in the forest.
Ironic, huh?
Isn't that where
gnomes live?
I don't really know that
much about gnomes.
Anyway, I know the
cops were here earlier.
So?
Well, you won't remember this,
but one night two years ago,
you drove me to the hospital
after I had an attack of angina.
Probably saved my life.
Anyway, I figure
I owe ya. Here.
You might wanna
wash that wrench off.
It's got something on it.
Sorry I'm late.
Mrs. Prescott broke
a crown and...
Orson, how well you look.
Hello, mother.
A word, darling?
I can't believe
you did this!
And I can't believe you told me
that she was senile! You lied to me.
Yes, to spare us the misery of her
company. You don't know her, Bree.
She's a loathsome woman, and
I refuse to break bread with her.
Now you listen to me.
That woman gave you life,
and the Fifth Commandment tells us
to honor our parents no matter how
hideous or repellent they may be.
That's not exactly what...
Orson, it's implied!
Now get out there and
show her some respect!
Fine, but if you expect anything
more from me than forced civility,
you will be deeply disappointed.
Bree, this salmon is superb.
Well, thank you!
It did win me the blue ribbon
at the gourmet county cookoff.
I just love the sauce.
What gives it that kick?
You'd never ask a magician
how a trick is done.
You've barely touched
your salmon, dear.
Is everything okay?
Yes.
I was just wondering
why you're here.
I want us to be friends.
Okay, let's suppose I just had a
massive head injury and believe you.
We're pals. Now
what do you want?
Orson, why does she have
to have an ulterior motive?
I want out of that home.
Ah, there it is.
It's a hellhole! Besides,
I'm perfectly healthy now.
My hip is better,
I can handle the stairs,
and you said when I got strong
enough I'd get to go back to my house.
Oh, here's the thing. I sold it.
What?
You heard me.
What about my things?
All gone.
Oh, I also sold the car.
See, that's the thing
about hellholes.
They don't pay
for themselves.
How dare you?
You had no right!
Okay! Maybe I will share
my secret ingredient.
I should have smothered you in
your crib when I had the chance.
Paprika! There, it's out!
That's the mother I remember!
I was wondering
when she'd show up.
Yes, Orson,
I am your mother,
so you more than anyone should
know how I deal with betrayal.
So...
Can we call her grandma?
I've got one more load, and
then I'm gonna do my homework.
Do you have anything you
want me to throw in?
No, I'm good. Thanks.
Mom, listen.
I know I've put you through
the wringer lately, and...
I'm sorry.
16 years of being perfect.
You were due.
That's what I don't get.
You've always
trusted my judgment.
Why can't you trust
me about Austin?
Relationships have nothing
to do with good judgment.
It doesn't matter
how smart you are.
You can still get hurt.
You do your homework.
I'm gonna finish the laundry.
Okay.
There you go, Mrs. H.
All right.
Can I use your bathroom, just...
Come on in.
Please, stay for dessert.
I'll work on Orson, and
we'll discuss this together.
You saw what he
sentenced me to...
A room no better
than a furnished coffin.
I have nothing
to say to him.
Well, then talk to me.
I know you're upset, but
don't shut me out. Please.
Please, Gloria, let me in.
Well, I didn't mean
it literally, but okay.
We'll, um, we'll sit together.
And we'll talk.
What are you doing?
I'm not going
back to that place.
Gloria, stop!
Let's get my mother back
to the home, shall we?
Not that it's any of my business, but,
is everything okay with you folks?
Oh, yeah, there was a little tension
earlier, but I think it's all been resolved.
Oh, what the hell?
No, I absolutely forbid it!
Just for a few weeks till we find
a place where she'll be happier.
You should've heard
her in the car.
She's absolutely miserable
in that nursing home.
I don't care.
My mother's not moving in here
till she fits in a jar on the mantle.
How can you be so cold?
You don't know who she is.
I've worked my entire life to
get away from that woman.
Why?
What could she possibly have done
to make you hate her so much?
Look, there is nothing to be
gained by dredging up the past.
Orson, if there's something
I should know.
Could I speak to
my son a moment?
Of course.
So you know,
I've decided to accept
your wife's kind invitation.
I won't allow it.
Oh, I think you will.
We're going to end
our quarrel right now,
or I'll tell your
wife what it's about.
You wouldn't.
Just try me.
I gave you life.
You know I won't
hesitate to take it away.
Now give mother a kiss.
Why in the hell would
I wanna do that?
To make it look real.
Hey, you're back!
I'd give you a hug,
but I'm really sweaty.
So how was New York?
Oh, it was fine.
Bree said you got
a job on the first day.
You're such a star!
I want details.
You know, just hours and hours
of sitting around, looking pretty.
But I think I'm done
with modeling.
So you're not gonna
move to New York?
Well, if something great
comes up, I might fly out,
but I'm pretty settled here.
Oh, thank God!
We were all so worried
we were losing you.
Okay, now I'm hugging you.
Oh, it's amazing.
Your life is such an adventure.
Can't wait to see
what you do next.
Yeah, me, too.
Okay.
Mr. Protector Man?
Shh! That's a secret.
Hello?
Hello?
Ah, sweet!
Mom, look!
Hey, don't to
Previously on Desperate Housewives...
Wisteria Lane's new hero...
Hello?
Superhero houses are great!
Turned out to be anything but.
Orson's mother took
up residence...
I've decided to accept
your wife's kind invitation.
You wouldn't.
And Mike couldn't remember...
No memory, huh?
That'sconvenient.
Anything at all.
Here's our search warrant.
We couldn't
find a toolbox.
You might want to
wash that wrench off.
It's got something on it.
I'm just saying that we never
spend the night at your house.
But your place is
so warm and cozy.
Oh, it's also
a disaster area.
I didn't get a chance
to clean it today.
Oops!
Oh, here, let me.
Susan Mayer had never
thought of herself as Cinderella,
but then one day...
a prince showed up.
Well, we can't have you
sleeping in squalor, can we?
My place it is.
And Susan realized
her life had become...
a fairy tale.
And since her prince had
welcomed her into his castle,
She felt the least she
could do was thank him...
Again...
And again...
And again.
The next morning, however,
Susan discovered castles...
Don't run themselves.
All right, oh...
But let's make it a quickie
'cause you are wasting water.
Sorry.
I didn't mean
to startle you.
Who are you?
I am Rupert.
I work for Mr. Hainsworth.
That would be the
man you slept with,
in case names
weren't exchanged.
Oh, no,
I'm your boss' girlfriend.
Surely he mentioned me.
Mm, not that I recollect.
Rupert.
Good morning...
boss.
I thought you
were off today.
Isn't... Isn't your
sister in town?
Uh, that's next
weekend, sir.
It's a good thing, too.
Otherwise, I might not have had
the pleasure of meeting your...
girlfriend.
Susan?
Yes, we met at the,
um, at the hospital.
Why don't I fetch
you a robe?
Loving that idea.
Would you care
for some breakfast?
Omelette?
Strawberry tart? Brioche?
Um, yeah,
that sounds great.
You pick.
Yes, Susan's life had indeed
become a fairy tale.
You are aware there
is a Mrs. Hainsworth?
Well, of course.
And what's a fairy tale...
Tart it is.
Without a dragon to slay?

We know dangerous men
walk among us.
What we can't be sure of
is who they are
or where they hide.
So the most we can
offer any stranger
is reasonable doubt.
But once the doubt is gone,
people are anything
but reasonable.
I am telling you, our
neighbor is a pedophile,
and I expect you
to do something about it.
Mrs. Scavo, he's not listed
on any sex offender registry.
He's never had so much
as a traffic ticket.
He's a single man with
a basement full of toys!
I understand your concern, but we
can't book a guy on possession of toys.
You don't get it.
His house had
this creepy vibe.
Tell him, Tom.
I never went down
to the actual room...
Okay, he wasn't there.
He doesn't know.
Look, he had a wall full of pictures
of half-naked boys in swimsuits.
Didn't you say
he was a swim coach?
What are you, his lawyer?
You have to admit, it's odd.
Here's what's odd...
If your neighbor
had something to hide,
why'd he invite you in
to see all of his stuff?
He wasn't technically home
when I went inside.
So you broke in?
The door was open...
I was bringing
him a cake.
A cake?
It was a "thank you" cake.
He sort of saved my life.
She didn't know thate was a pedophile
when she baked the actual cake.
He doesn't care
about the cake, Tom.
Why are you snapping at me?
I'm not snapping at you.
You're totally snapping.
I am snapping
because there is
a monster across the street,
and Barney Fife here is making
me sound like the bad guy!
Look, I'm sorry.
She's been under a lot
of stress, hasn't slept well.
You better not be
apologizing for me!
Gotta go.
So, I've got some
fabulous news.
Well, I hope it's more
fabulous than this dress.
I look something
Ike Turner would hit.
You're gonna have to find yourself
another personal shopper.
What, I slam one dress,
and you quit on me?
No, that's my news.
I'm leaving the store and
starting my own business.
"Beauty by Vern"?
You're opening up a salon?
God, could you get any gayer?
It's a consulting firm for
beauty pageant contestants.
And the answer's "yes. "
This week, I'm coaching little girls
for the Miss Snowflake pageant.
It's very rewarding.
Hey, you know what might be fun?
If you come down
and give a talk.
You know, give the
kids some pointers.
Vern, I worked the catwalks
in Milan and Paris.
I'm not gonna give makeup tips
to little miss training bra.
You have been
in rare bitch form.
It's been months now,
so don't blame it on your cycle.
Don't call me a bitch,
and stop tracking my cycle.
I told you that freaks me out.
I'm just saying you've
been very cranky today.
What's going on?
The divorce decree
came through today.
Carlos is officially
out of my life.
Oh, honey.
The girls' ages
range 8 to 12.
We meet every Thursday in
the rec room of the elks lodge.
I'm not doing it.
You need a project.
That's your problem,
you're bored.
And you know what
the cure for that is...
Helping others.
Fine. I'll do it,
But I want
this dress for free.
Evil! You said
you hated it.
And I hate helping
others, too,
but I'm doing that,
aren't I?
Is the coast clear?
I don't wanna
flash the help again.
Relax.
He's making breakfast,
But you're more than
welcome to flash me.
How long has Rupert
worked for you?
Oh, for years.
He's practically family.
So you're that close, and
you never told him about me?
Yes, about that...
Rupert was incredibly
devoted to Jane.
He's, uh, never seen me
with another woman,
Let alone a frisky,
naked one.
Well, that explains why he was
a little cold to me this morning.
Was he?
I'll have a talk with him.
Oh, no, don't do that.
That'll just make it wor.
I get it.
He loved Jane.
He doesn't know me.
You know, I'll just
have to charm him,
warm him up a little.
Well, I'm, uh,
I'm sure you'll find a way.
Great.
9:00 in the morning,
and I have to put on
a slinky, black cocktail dress.
Hey, here's an idea.
You keep some things
in a drawer at my house.
Would it be okay
if I had one here?
A drawer?
Do you think we'll
be here that often?
Your shower
s six power nozzles.
With or without you,
I'll be back.
Well, then by all means,
let's get you a drawer.
I don't need much.
One of those will do.
Actually,
that's not a good idea.
Rupert arranges
things meticulously.
You'll never win him over
if you mess with his system.
Rupert?
Wow! Your timing's perfect.
Not always.
Susan will be
needing a drawer.
A drawer, sir?
Yes, for her things.
She's gonna be spending
more time here.
Yeah, Rupe, I hope
we can be good friends,
'cause you're gonna be
seeing lots more of me.
Oh, madam, that
hardly seems possible.
Mother Hodge,
your food will get cold!
Why, please, is there a lock
on the liquor cabinet?
Because your doctor says people taking
your medication shouldn't drink.
A warning you've chosen
to ignore if the...
lipstick on the vodka
bottle is any indication.
Poached fish again?
I don't want this.
I want what
you're all having.
Well, your doctor has you
on a low fat, low sodium diet.
Eight meals this week,
Eight times I've told
you the same thing.
So, who would
like to say grace?
Allow me.
Dear Lord,
I thank you for this bland,
indifferently prepared meal,
and beseech you to ignite
some spark of compassion
in my coldhearted
daughter-in-law.
That she might show
some shred of mercy to me,
her wretched captive.
Amen.
Mother, may I remind you,
you asked to come here?
I didn't know I'd be trading
one jail for another.
At least at the home
you could bribe the orderlies
to smuggle things in,
But here, nothing gets
past the commandant.
I have done
everything I can
to make you happy
and comfortable.
What do you want from us?
I want my freedom.
I want out of this
perky little gulag
and into a house
I can call my own.
And you're going
to buy it for me.
I can't afford
to buy you a house.
You can't afford not to.
I know a house won't
be easy to swing,
but how many more of these Edward
Albee dinners do you want to sit through?
What did she mean by,
"you can't afford not to"?
Was she threatening
you with something?
Yes, she's threatening to
make us miserable till we cave.
Look, at least see if Edie
has any cheap listings.
We'll be happier,
my mother will be happier...
Yeah, and she'll take
terrible care of herself
and be dead in a year.
You just stole my
next argument.
Okay, you've got enough
money to pay either
the phone or the cable
bill, but not both.
Hello? Mike.
I'm trying to
help you here.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Just do whatever you want.
Fine. Cable it is.
Nobody calls you anyway.
What do you want?
My toilet's clogged.
I thought maybe
you could fix it.
Oh, wait, you can't,
can you?
'Cause you don't
have any tools.
Must be tough being
a plumber without tools.
Why don't you people
leave me the hell alone?
Jeez,
you sure are hostile for a guy who
makes his living in the service industry.
You know, it just occurred to me,
there's no point in paying the cable bill
If you're not gonna
have electricity,
So I'm thinking pay the
electricity upfront and...
Where have you been?
They're all waiting for you.
I'm here to teach fashion,
so I'm fashionably late.
Cute.
Now remember, these mothers have refinanced
their trailers In order to pay for this,
so when you make your entrance,
for God sakes, sparkle.
Now in addition to her
three Vogue covers,
you may remember her as
the face of La Roque cosmetics.
Please welcome miss
Gabrielle Marquez!
Vern?
A moment.
Is there a problem?
Yes!
What am I supposed to do with
that petting zoo out there?
Not everyone wins the
genetic lottery like you did.
These girls need help
finding the promised land
of beauty and style.
Please, Gabrielle,
be their moses.
Good comparison,
because it's gonna take a miracle
to turn these mutts into show dogs.
Hey, girls,
let's talk beauty.
What's up, brother?
I'm sorry. You are...
Carlos from
down the street.
We were only
best friends, dude.
Things have been
a little fuzzy,
since the accident.
I'm sorry that I, uh,
I hadn't come by sooner,
but my divorce has
been kicking my ass.
I'm sorry to hear that.
Anyway, I got a new condo,
but it's getting renovated,
So I was thinking
maybe I could crash here.
Here?
Yeah, I could help you
out around the house,
and free you up to focus
on job one,
getting better.
'Cause you're tossing it
to Edie now, right?
That's a real
relationship killer,
needing your lady
to hoist you off the can.
How long are we talking?
Couple months.
Three at the most.
And, of course, I can kick in
for half the utilities and rent.
Well, how can I say no
to my best friend?
Can you do a kickflip?
What are the Blake kids
doing all the way over here?
Pam needs to keep
a closer eye on them.
Will you please come
away from that window?
You barely slept last night.
Come on. Take a nap.
I'm fine. I'm fine.
Hold on.
Hey, what's up?
I've been meaning to
get this back to you,
and to thank you.
Rebecca and I really
enjoyed the cake.
Oh! Good.
So...
Bye.
So what'd you think
of our place?
S orry?
I heard you were good friends
with the Young family.
It must have been weird being in
there with all the new furniture.
I didn't notice.
Well, how about
the kitchen?
Rebecca likes the color,
but I'm not so sure.
Oh, sorry. Never made it
past the living room.
What?! Come on!
You're in an empty house,
curious about
your new neighbors...
You look around.
We all do it.
Well, I don't.
Well, next time you're over,
I'll have to give you the tour.
Great, great.
Mr. Protector man!
Hey, hey,
not now, Parker.
I just wanted to see if I can
play his pinball machine again.
I guess there's no
need for that tour.
All right, girls,
first things first things first.
If you can't walk,
you can't win.
Hit it, Vern!
Remember, eyes forward,
shoulders back, hips square.
Look left, look right,
whip and walk.
Yes, I'm unbelievable.
Close your mouths.
Stop, stop.
What?
My eyes were forward,
my hips were square.
But where's your confidence?
Where's your pride?
Come on. What do
I have to be proud of?
Have you guys ever
seen a runway model
without the hot
clothes and makeup?
Well, trust me,
they're not that special,
But the one thing that
they do have is attitude.
You have to
believe in yourself,
and if not, pretend to
believe in yourself, okay?
All right.
Now I want you to pretend
you're on the runway...
Flashbulbs are popping,
everyone's looking at you,
envying you,
and they're all thinking
the same thing...
Isabel Horowitz
is smoking hot!
Go, Isabel! Go!
You're doing it!
Isabel, you're doing it!
That's it! Keep going!
I was walking!
You were
totally walking!
Good job!
All right, Donna, you're next.
Get up there and make
me hate your beauty.
Now this place is a real
diamond in the rough.
Cozy little
two-bedroom plus den,
with a highly
motivated seller.
Oh, look, a highly
motivated cockroach.
Let's try to be
positive, people.
It's a fabulous location.
Just walking distance
to all sorts of fun shops.
Right, from here I can see a bail
bondsman and an adult bookshop.
What do you expect in
your price range, "Tara"?
Let's go.
Thank you.
Wait.
I'm not an
impractical woman.
I know that my son's
resources are...
like his achievements,
rather limited.
I want to see
the rest of it.
Okay.
Now the lighting in the
kitchen is a bit harsh.
The previous owner...
Well, let's just say
he ran some sort of
home-based medical business.
You cannot let your mother
move into this neighborhood.
It's filled with
junkies and whores.
And we'll owe
them all an apology,
but who cares?
She likes it.
Of course she likes it.
There's a 24-hour liquor
store across the street.
She wants a house.
This ithe best we can afford
without bankrupting ourselves.
Orson, what if something
should happen to her?
Stop worrying about her.
Worry about us.
Do you realize how much we've
been fighting since she came?
The woman's ruined
every relationship
that's mattered to me,
and she's doing it again.
Oh, my God!
Are you all right?
Oh! Mother?
It's just a little spill.
Her cane hit a loose tile.
Is anything broken?
Well, obviously, the damn floor.
We'll need that fixed
before she moves in.
Are you insane?!
She obviously can't
be on her own.
Why, it's a loose tile.
I'm perfectly fine.
And what if you weren't?
What if she had broken something
and she was lying here for hours?
You are coming home with us.
Bree...
And I will not hear
another word on the subject.
I can't believe
you bought us pizza.
Well, you guys earned it.
But eat fast, because we only
have one hour left, and I want
to introduce you to your new
best friend, Mr. Spray Tan.
You know so much cool stuff.
Can't you come back another day?
Oh, I don't know.
Please?
You have to.
Well, let me
check my book.
I might have to move
some stuff around,
but I think I can swing it.
Your life must be
so exciting, huh?
Yeah, every
day's a parade.
So what was it like
being a famous model?
Honestly, it was
like any other job,
except the pay was great,
the clothes were couture,
and the parties were
just this side of Gomorrah.
You don't know what
Gomorrah means, do you?
Good.
Did you know Kate Moss?
I invited her to a party once.
Did you eat pizza with her?
'Cause if you did, it's almost
like we ate pizza with her.
Well, honey, most
models don't eat pizza.
Well, at least not without
having a finger for dessert.
Gross.
I know. I never did that.
You would not believe the horrible
things these girls did to stay skinny.
Like what?
Well, some would smoke those
unfiltered french cigarettes.
But cigarettes
can kill you.
But before they do,
they kill your appetite.
One time,
there was a girl who took
too many laxatives, and, uh...
Well, if you're ever at the
Chateau Milan in room 238,
do not use the jacuzzi.
Do you have to be
skinny to be a model?
Well, yeah. When's the last time you
saw a fat person on a magazine cover?
Now I'm gonna go talk to
Vern about our next session.
You guys finish lunch
so we can get back to work.
Hi, Rupert!
I went to the mall and bought a change of clothes
for the weekend, and while I was there,
I got something for you.
I thought you could
wear it on your day off.
Do you like it?
Very much.
It'll come in handy,
should my nationality
ever slip my mind.
That was good.
You... I wanna
party with you.
Hey, I was thinking this afternoon
maybe we could go look for that drawer.
Oh, I'm sorry, ma'am.
I'm afraid I have
all this silver to polish.
Well, let me help you,
and we can talk.
There is so much
I wanna know about you.
Who is Rupert
Cavanaugh?
What makes him tick?
Tell you what. Let's go
find you that drawer, hmm?
Oh, isn't the master
bedroom down that way?
I realize it's
a bit of a jaunt,
But I managed to find
you an entire bureau.
Okay, well, you certainly
didn't have to go to all that...
trouble.
Is there a problem?
No, I just, um...
Well, all I really needed
was just a little...
Little drawer, and, uh...
this is just so far away
and what is that smell?
Oh, yes, about that...
The cat passed
away in this room.
Did you consider
removing the body?
Well, if this
isn't acceptable,
I can look elsewhere
for a drawer
when I have the time.
Why do you have
to be this way?
What way is that?
Listen, I know how
you feel about Jane,
but if you could just
give me a chance...
I mean, come on,
you can't possibly hate
me this much, can you?
I'm done.
Fine. Fine,
fine, fine, fine.
I don't need you
to like me,
but I think you should
give me just a little respect.
I am Ian's girlfriend.
He's still married.
At best,
you're his mistress.
Okay, you are not
allowed to call me that.
Fine. What term
would you prefer?
Concubine? Consort?
Gold-digging whore?
I'm so sorry.
I'm, I shouldn't
have done that.
But, Rupert,
you have to admit,
it's just a drawer.
Those drawers are
filled with Jane's things.
This is her house.
You are a guest
in her house,
and a temporary
one at best.
Okay, you know,
that is for Ian to decide.
Oh, he has decided.
Why do you think he never
told me about you?
Why did he wait so long
to bring you here?
He didn't want you
in that room,
where he still keeps Jane's
things exactly as she left them.
But...
I'll keep looking
for that drawer.
Hey, I'm going
over to Mike's.
I thought you were
gonna mow the lawn.
I know. It's just that I promised
I'd help him install a shower bar,
And, um,
it could take a while.
Okay.
T Rex. How they
hanging, brother?
Low and lazy.
Here you go.
Yeah.
Hey, if Lynette asks,
I installed your
shower bar today.
Got it.
Vern, what are
you doing here?
We need to talk.
Is it about the
girls' makeup?
'Cause I got them each
their own makeup kit,
custom-tailored
to match their skin tone.
And I got melina some wax.
I know she's only 11,
but those greek genes are
gonna kick in any day now.
What?
This morning, Mrs. Hayes caught
Donna her finger down her throat,
trying to barf up
her toaster waffle.
Really?
And Mrs. Horowitz found Isabel
behind their garage smoking.
Apparently, she thought cigarettes
would help her lose a few pounds.
Where do you think
she got that idea?
Those damn tobacco companies!
Gaby!
Fine, I may have told a few
stories about the old days,
but as a warning.
I didn't say anything
inappropriate for kids.
Cassie Warren asked her mother
If she could throw a Gomorrah party.
Okay, look, we have to do
damage control. I get it.
Next session,
I'll apologize to all the moms.
Unh-unh, there's not gonna
be a next session for you.
The moms don't want you
anywhere near their daughters.
But I'm helping them.
They love me!
Wait, please, Vern,
you have to give me
a chance to fix this.
It's too late, Gaby. You are
now officially a bad influence.
Well, see you
at spin class.
Mom said we couldn't leave.
I'm just going out front.
What the hell is that?!
Stop running the ball!
Can I ask you
guys something?
What was I like
before the accident?
What do you mean?
I mean,
what kind of guy was I?
Was I happy? Was I angry?
Did I ever get violent?
You were fine.
I'm serious.
I really need to know.
You can be honest.
You're my best friend.
Honestly?
You were sort of mysterious,
kept to yourself.
Nobody really knew
you all that well.
And this is coming
from your best friend.
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Yes!
I'm sorry, guys,
I just...
I guess I was really tired.
Where's your brother?
He went outside.
Yeah.
What...
Okay, watch her!
Watch her.
I'll be back.
I'll be right back.
Hello? Open up!
Open the door!
Lynette? What's the matter?
I want my son.
He's not here.
He's not at our house,
he's not in our yard.
Do not jerk me around.
Parker!
You can't just barge into
my house like this, Lynette.
Don't play dumb with me.
I know exactly what
is down here!
Where's the pinball?
Where's all the games?
Oh, that was a collection I was
taking up for the children's hospital.
I delivered
everything yesterday.
Did you donate
the photos, too?
Parker!
What exactly is it
you're accusing me of?
Don't pretend you don't know.
I'm calling the police.
Parker!
Is there a problem?
You're damn right
there's a problem.
I can't find my son.
Isn't that your son?
Hey, hey!
Where have you been?!
We were at Mike's.
He wandered over looking for me.
What's going on?
Well, that was the
children's hospital.
Art's story checks out.
He donated all that stuff.
That proves nothing. He knew I was on
to him. He had to dump it someplace.
Honey, believe me,
I am with you.
There is something fishy
about this guy.
But you gotta get a grip.
You can't go barging
into people's homes.
What if Parker had been in there?
But he wasn't,
And if you keep accusing
this guy whout proof,
he can sue us.
Listen...
I've been thinking that after everything
that you have been through...
Please don't bring up
the supermarket again.
That was
a traumatic experience.
I think it's affected you
more than you realize.
And maybe you need to talk
to somebody about it...
Like a therast.
You're right.
I need to talk to someone.
He'd gotten rid
of everything...
The toys, the pictures,
everything was gone.
You can't sit
on this, Lynette.
I know!
If something happened to someone's
kid because I kept my mouth shut...
The thing is,
I promised Tom I'd back off.
Well, I didn't.
Jane has
some beautiful things.
Yes, she's always had
impeccable taste.
I, um, I know how
it must seem to you.
My holding on to them.
But I justouldn't
bring myself to...
I get it.
As much as I have
tried to pretend that
it's just you and me.
There's three of us
in this relationship.
Susan, you know
I adore you.
No, please, listen...
The last couple of months,
I thought we've
gotten really close,
and I have been loving that.
I just feel like lately...
There's thisimit to how
far you'll let me in.
Well, I'm trying.
It's just the, um, the more
I let you into my heart,
the more I feel I'm
pushing Jane out and...
You don't have to push
Jane out to let me in.
Of course. You're right.
Do you know what I think?
No.
That kind of compassionate wisdom
deserves an obscenely expensive meal.
Okay, well,
give me a minute,
and I will change
into something nice.
Rupert still hasn't
found you a drawer?
No, not just yet.
Well, in that case...
Ian, you don't
have to do that.
If I can make room in
my heart for both of you,
I can certainly make
room in my bureau.
It's just not right.
Your mother skipped lunch, too.
She said she
wasn't hungry.
Can't we just revel
in her absence?
I know she's a handful, but she
deserves some compassion.
The woman watched
a dream die yesterday.
I'm taking her dinner up.
Oh, that's okay.
I'll do it.
Oh, no,
I'd rather do it myself.
I wanna talk to her.
Oh, well, I'll let her
know you're coming.
Mom's coming.
Ditch the wine.
Very well.
You finished the
whole bottle already?
I was... thirsty.
Gloria, I've been
thinking and...
Does no one in this house
ever bother to knock?
Is that alcohol?
Where did you get that?
Andrew!
When my grandma asks me a favor
with tears in her eyes, how...
Oh, shut up,
you little extortionist.
He charged me 20 bucks,
plus 5 for the corkscrew.
I'll deal with you later.
You can kiss that
codeine good-bye.
Andrew brought her wine.
Oh, for God's sake.
This is our house.
If you expect to stay here, You're
going to learn to obey a few rules.
I don't obey rules.
I make them.
Not anymore, mother.
Just watch yourself,
sonny boy.
Okay, look,
I know you're upset, but don't
blame Orson. It's not his fault.
It's all his fault.
You think he's so wonderful.
You don't know the half
of what he's done.
Let's go. I can't deal with
her when she's like this.
He doesn't want you
to hear the truth,
how he cheated on Alma.
What?
She's drunk!
How he broke her
heart... and mine,
All for his precious Monique.
You shut up, mother.
Monique Polier?
I thought that was
Harvey Bigsby's mistress.
Oh, she got around,
that girl!
See, I told you.
I told you she would do this.
There he was,
cheating on Alma,
not knowing all the time his
whore was cheating on him.
Stop it!
You shut your evil mouth!
Or what?!
What are you gonna do to me
that hasn't already been done?
Bree...
Bree!
Bree, no!
Bree, wait!
Bree!
I know. I thought
it was so adorable.
Skirt...
I know!
Miss Gabrielle!
What is she doing here?
I have no idea.
I told her she was banned.
Okay, just give
me a minute.
I'm sorry about what
I said to the girls,
and it won't
happen again.
Damn right. You're not going
anywhere near our girls.
Can't you give me
a second chance?
Why should we?
Yeah, I mean, you walk in here all
clickety-clack, perfect little miss size zero,
thinking you're all
better than us.
We all saw the look on your
face when you showed up.
I don't think
I'm better than you.
Hell, I envy you.
Please.
No, it's true.
You have husbands and families and
a reason to wake up in the morning.
What do I have?
Him.
Teaching your kids
about confidence and
beauty is the most useful
thing I've done since...
I don't know when.
And as much as
I've helped them...
They've helped me
so much more.
So please, I need this.
And I promise, no more talk
about dodgy weight loss methods.
Like the highly effective,
non-F.D.A. approved diet pill
I can get from my
friends in zurich...
in bulk.
Well, I suppose the Christian
thing would be to forgive her.
Well, why don't you
ladies talk it over?
And I'm gonna work on
posture with the girls.
Yeah! Come on!
Come on, you guys.
Let's go!
As long they're safe...
Oh, thank God.
I've been driving around
all night looking for you.
We saw that woman
at the morgue...
On our wedding night.
You pretended
not to know her.
Bree, I can explain.
No.
I'm done.
You don't understand
what happened.
There were two women
in your life before me.
One vanished, and the other was killed.
That's all I need to understand.
I've packed some
of your things.
I want you out of the house.
Now.
Bree...
Please...
I love you.
I know...
but it scares
the hell out of me.
Dangerous men
walk among us,
and we can't always
be sure of who they are
or what secrets they hide.
But once our worst
suspicions are confirmed,
we can take action.
Once their agendas
are revealed...
We can take steps,
to protect ourselves,
and those we love.
Yes, dangerous men
can cause great harm.
But sometimes the greatest
danger they pose...
I'll take those.
Is to themselves.
Previously on Desperate Housewives...
Orson's wife Alma
disappeared...
Gaby found
a new calling...
Yes, I'm unbelievable.
Close your mouths.
Someone new
moved in...
He's a bachelor who
lives with his invalid sister.
But Lynette found
a dark secret...
Our neighbor
is a pedophile.
You can't sit
on this, Lynette.
Orson's mother
revealed his past...
He cheated on Alma,
broke her heart.
For his precious Monique.
Monique Polier?
And the police couldn't
find the evidence...
We couldn't find a toolbox.
The man's a plumber.
Until Mike
tried to hide it.
I'll take those.
The annual block party was a
winter tradition on Wisteria Lane.
It was a way for the residents
to spread holiday cheer.
Everyone was invited...
Including Art Shepard,
The newest resident
of Wisteria Lane.
But as the big
night drew near,
more than holiday cheer
was being spread around.
Hey, did you hear about the
new guy that just moved in?
Well, get a load of this...
Apparently, the perv's got all
this weird stuff In his basement.
No, seriously.
It's like this big kiddie
trap full of toys.
By Sunday evening,
most of the gossiping
had subsided,
and the neighborhood
was once again
consumed by the
spirit of the season.
Friends laughed
over eggnog,
lovers kissed
under mistletoe,
and the mood
was jolly.
That is, until
a certain guest
made his appearance.
Look who's here!
Merry Christmas,
everybody!
Merry Christmas!
Now, kids, who's been
good this year?
Oh, come on,
everybody was naughty?
What am I gonna do
with this fire truck?
Joey, get back here.
What's going on?
I'm not sure.
Let's go, girls.
Art, maybe we should go.
Yes, for the residents
of Wisteria Lane,
it was the most wonderful
time of the year.
But for Arthur Shepard
and his sister,
it had turned t to be
a very silent night.
By Tyno, Wisteria Team Forom. com
& DHsubs. free. fr Transcript by FRM
For the residents
of Wisteria Lane,
the holiday season
could only begin,
once the decorations
came out.
For some, that meant
pulling out the colored lights.
For others, it meant
locating that holiday wreath.
And then there were those eager
to display their nativity scene.
But for a romantic few,
it was all about
the mistletoe.
You have to kiss me.
It's the law.
While you're in a good mood,
I thought I'd spring something on you.
My parents are coming to town.
Your parents? Really?
And I wondered if you might be free
to join us for dinner Saturday.
Absolutely.
So I assume this means
they know about me?
But of course.
And they know
about me as in...
"Mum, Dad, bloody good news.
I've got melf a smashing new girlfriend. "
That's adorable.
Please don't do it
in front of them.
Right.
So, um...
Do you want me to make reservations
at that little french place?
We could do that,
but it's a 4-hour layover and
they're going to be exhausted,
and I thought we might have
a more enjoyable time
if they came here and
you made dinner for them.
Okay, I guess it's time
we have the conversation.
Ian...
Haven't you ever wondered
why I've never cooked for you?
I just assumed
that you were lazy.
I wish.
My cooking...
is not good.
Well, my parents won't be
expecting a gourmet meal.
Will they be expecting
stomach cramps,
acid reflux,
night sweats?
Come on,
you can't be that bad.
It is really important that I make
them a home-cooked meal?
Well, it's just that they're very
old-fashioned hearth-and-home types,
and they might wonder why
you didn't make the effort.
But it's okay.
You'll win them over...
Eventually.
Okay, I'll give it a shot.
Thank you.
Now nothing elaborate.
Just a simple roast and, uh,
and something
appropriate to go with it.
Right...
Like an ambulance.
No, Amy, small
steps. Small!
Little Miss Snowflake glides.
She doesn't stomp.
Is that better?
Getting there, sweetie.
If she was a horse,
we'd have to shoot her.
Poor thing,
she tries so hard.
Yeah, she's a trooper.
Let's dump her.
What?! Why?
Pageant consultants are judged
on the strength of their roster.
You know, we can't afford to bounce
every nose-picking no-talent,
but we can definitely lose the one who's
dragging us down, and that's Amy.
We can't do that!
Her mother died last year.
Yes, I know, I know, and it's tragic,
but we are running a business.
Amy is sucking up all of our time,
and we should be focusing on Sherri.
She actually has
a shot at winning.
How will I tell her family?
We'll do it together.
We'll be very diplomatic.
Are you sure about this?
The poor kid's been
through the wringer and...
Amy!
For God sakes,
Little Miss Snowflake
does not scratch down there!
Well, then again,
her mother died a year ago.
How long is she
gonna milk it?
Mother Hodge,
I have your breakfast.
Just put it over there.
I'll pick through it later.
Merry Christmas!
Oh, wait.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
What are you watching?
Home movies.
It's fun looking back
at the past, isn't it?
Well, it's one way to kill time
while you're waiting for death.
We also have cable.
Have you decided what
you're gonna do about Orson?
Decided?
Yes.
Have you called
a lawyer yet?
I don't think that's
any of your concern.
I don't mean
to pry, but,
I think you're a good
Christian woman,
and you deserve
better than my son.
Well, I will take that
under advisement.
If you give him a chance,
he'll draw you back in.
It's what he does.
Just walk away.
It's not that easy.
I love him.
You'll get over it.
I did.
Merry Christmas!
Oh, wait.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Okay.
Well, believe me,
Rita, he scares me, too.
You know what?
We should have a meeting,
get all the Moms together
and figure out what
to do about this guy.
Yeah, Saturday, your
house. Sounds good.
Hey, Rita, I gotta go.
Sorry, I can't talk now.
I have somewhere to go.
Well, my brother doesn't.
The youth center just fired him.
Are you happy?
I'm not sad. He shouldn't be
around kids. I saw those pictures.
Those boys were
on his swim team.
He was proud of them.
Turning that into something dirty
says more about you than him.
You can defend
him all you want.
I know what I know.
Did you know my
brother got spit on
at the hardware
store yesterday?
That they refused to
serve us at the diner,
that our tire got slashed
at the church parking lot?
I am not a well woman.
I don't need this stress.
Well...
I am sorry
that happened.
Have you considered even for a
Moment that you could be wrong,
that you misinterpreted
what you saw,
That you are ruining my
brother's life and mine
over nothing?
I have kids, okay?
Better safe than sorry.
So as long you're safe what
do you care who's sorry?
So I'm cooking dinner for
Ian's parents tomorrow night,
and it's the first time I'm meeting them,
so I sort of wanna impress them.
And yet you're cooking?!
Well, that's the thing.
Uh, so I was hoping, you know,
if you're not too busy...
Oh, no, no, these things
practically build themselves.
Thank you.
You are a lifesaver.
Actually...
I could probably use
the distraction.
I asked Orson to
move out last night.
Oh, come on! Why would you
bury your toolbox in the woods?
I knew the cops were
looking for it, and I panicked.
I was just trying to
buy myself me time.
Well, you may have
bought yourself 20 to life!
Let the guy enjoy his breakfast.
Stay out of this, Carlos.
Mike, I want you
to look at me.
Yeah, you look me in the
eye and you swear to me
that you didn't
kill anybody.
How many times do I have
to tell you? I can't remember.
You can't remember,
or you don't wanna remember?
Um, guys.
Bree, you have got to go
to the police with all of this.
I can't. Not yet. I need
some time to think.
His wife goes missing,
then his mistress turns up dead.
What is there
to think about?
I know it sounds suspicious,
but in my heart of hearts,
I just can't believe that
Orson could do such a thing.
S weetie,
we all wanna believe
the best of the people
we care about,
But you cannot let your feelings for
a man blind you to cold hard facts.
What in the world?
Oh, my God!
What's going on?
They just arrested
Mike for murder.
What?!
They're saying he killed
that woman othe news,
That Monique person.
Oh, thank God!
I can't believe we're gonna
break that little girl's heart.
Do not wimp out
on me here.
We gotta do what's
best for the business.
What if the father yells at me?
Then I will jump in and defend you.
Okay, but if you do,
try and be diplomatic.
I'm always diplomatic.
Now just get in there,
you spineless 'mo.
Excuse me, Mr. Pearce?
I'm so glad you
could come today.
This is my partner Gabrielle.
Pleasure to meet you.
Shall we?
So, uh, what did you
wanna talk to me about?
Is there a problem
with Amy?
Not a problem, per se.
We're just a little concerned
that she might not have the, um...
temperament for
pageant competitions.
And what does that mean?
Well, when it comes
to performing,
she's not exactly...
Well, she tends to be...
Feel free to jump in.
I have no idea where
you're going with this.
Well, as Gaby
and I discussed,
Amy has certain limitations and
her odds of winning are slim.
Vern!
He is so competitive.
I constantly have to remind
him they're just kids.
When did you lose the joy?
Oh, I think you know.
Wait, I'm confused.
Are you dumping Amy?
Of course not, Bill.
Can I call you Bill?
It's just we feel that Amy would
benefit from some private coaching.
Maybe I could come to your
house? Say, Friday, 5:00?
Sure. Yeah, I guess.
Great! It's a date.
Maybe I should come, too.
After the harsh things
you said about Amy?
I don't think so.
I'm gonna need
a good lawyer.
And that may take
a little research.
And whoever takes my
case will need a retainer,
so if you don't mind,
I promise I'll pay you back.
Oh, okay.
And make sure he knows
about my wrench.
Apparently, they tested it and
found traces of this Monique's blood.
What's wrong?
I don't know if you picked
up on this, Mike, but...
I haven't been happy.
No, I didn't
pick up on it.
Well, I wanted to tell
you this weeks ago,
and I wish that I had,
because now
I know you're gonna think
that I'm breaking up with you
over this whole blood
on the ax thing.
Wrench.
Whatever. But believe
me, that's not it.
It's just...
We are moving too fast.
What are you
trying to say?
Well, maybe we should
just... take a break.
You know...
date other people.
You're telling me this on the
day I'm put in a men's prison?
Well, I said the
timing was bad.
I am sorry. I...
I really am.
I just can't do this.
They told me somebody was coming,
but I did not expect it to be you.
Is Edie getting you
a good lawyer?
I doubt it.
She dumped me today.
What? Why?
Well, I was
arrested for murder.
Still...
It's tacky.
Well, okay then, uh...
I'll help get you out.
What's your bail?
A million dollars.
You don't have
to help me, Susan.
I want to.
Aren't you gonna ask?
What?
If I killed that woman?
I don't have to.
I know you didn't.
I wish I was that sure.
I have these flashes,
where I see her face,
so I must've known her.
And if I did, maybe
something happened.
maybe I got
angry, maybe...
There's an explanation for this,
and we're gonna figure it out.
Don't worry about a thing.
Miss Gabrielle!
When are you gonna
come outside and watch me?
Oh, um, the grass, honey,
and my allergies...
Go ahead and practice.
I'll watch you from here.
Are you sure I can't
help with anything?
I've been a single
Dad for a while now.
I got the dinner
thing down.
I've got the restaurant
thing down.
I can't bring myself
to cook for one.
Not that I ever
cooked for two.
Well, no restaurant tonight.
You are having dinner with us.
That's sweet.
It's the least I can do to
thank you for helping Amy.
Oh. It's nothing.
Yeah, she's
a special girl.
So...
How is it for you,
being single again?
Oh, honestly?
I hate it. It's like I've
forgotten how to date.
Me, too. You know,
I even let a friend of mine talk me
into one of those speed dating things.
How was it?
I didn't even go in.
I just sat in this
hotel lobby.
I watched all these lonely,
desperate single people filing in,
and then it hit me,
I'm one of them.
I know what
you mean.
Did you see that?
It spun three times
and then I caught it.
You didn't see.
Yeah, I'm sorry, sweetie.
I was distracting Gabrielle.
Oh, no, no,
it's totally my fault.
I'm sorry, sweetie.
Go outside and do it again.
I promise this time
we're gonna watch.
Come in.
Hey.
Wow, oh,
those are gorgeous.
Well, I figured you'd be too busy
cooking to manage a centerpiece.
Well, you, uh, you may not be a good
cook but you're certainly a tidy one.
Don't worry. Dinner's all
taken care of. We're having...
Blanquette de veau and
a grand marnier souffl.
Well, that's very
ambitious of you,
and, uh, when will Bree
be done making it?
5:30.
But I am rewarming
it all by myself.
Oh, what's, uh,
what's all this?
Mike was arrested
for murder.
My God.
I mean, of course
he's totally innocent.
I'm just trying to help
him find a lawyer.
Shouldn't, um, shouldn't
his girlfriend be doing that?
Yeah. Edie dumped him.
Okay, I know how
this looks but
I just feel bad.
He's just a friend now.
Yes. Yes, a friend
you sat by for six months,
hoping he'd wake up
and ravish you again.
You are the only one allowed
to ravish me these days,
So stop worrying.
Orson, it's me again.
Please call.
We need to talk.
I'll do the chips.
You deal.
You got it.
Guys, why has it been so long
since we've played poker?
I really need this.
Oh, me, too.
There's nothing more relaxing than an
afternoon of finger food and girl talk.
Hi, ladies!
Hey! How you doing?
So did you tell the police that
you think Orson killed Monique?
What?!
No, I did not,
and I don't plan to.
But Mike is in jail,
and you said yourself
you thought Orson did it.
I said I had concerns,
Concerns that have disappeared
now that Mike has been arrested.
What are you saying?
You think Mike is guilty?
Hey, why don't we
start that girl talk?
I'll get the ball rolling.
Anybody have a yeast infection?
They found Monique's blood on the wrench
that Mike was trying to dispose of.
I mean, that hardly
screams innocence.
Her teeth were pulled.
You don't think that's worth telling the cops
she was messing around with a dentist?
Orson was slipping it
to the dead chick?
Mike is innocent.
I know that in my heart.
We all have
convictions, Susan.
I believe Mike's last one
was for manslaughter.
Okay, okay, we've all made
some excellent points
and blown off
a little steam.
Whoo! Let's play
some cards.
If you're so sure that
Orson is innocent,
why don't we go through his
things? Where's his desk?
At his office.
And what did you think
you'd find there anyway?
I don't know.
A blackmail letter,
a necklace made of teeth?
We're not gonna
play cards, are we?
Nope.
Well, I am certainly not
playing with a woman
that is willing to let Mike take
the fall for her psycho husband.
Well, needless to say, I won't be
cooking dinner for Ian's parents.
Fine. I'll cook myself.
Good.
Let me know if there
are any survivors.
And if you take Orson back,
you do the same.
Well, that was
incredibly awkward.
I'm sorry you both
had to sit through it.
Was it me?
Was I out of line?
Oh, I'm not
taking sides.
This will blow over.
You're right...
Hey, come on in.
You're just in time.
Thanks so much, Rita.
I think it's such a good idea that
we all get together and talk and...
Wow.
Wow. What is all this?
We decided to stage a
protest in front of Art's house.
A protest?
Mm-Hmm.
Rita, I want the word
"pedophile" to really stand out.
Do we have any glitter?
Say "molester. "
It sounds scarier.
I'm sorry. I thought we were all gonna talk
about how to keep an eye on this guy.
We're past talking.
The guy's a menace.
Well, that's what we think,
but we don't exactly have proof.
The youth center just fired him.
How much proof to you need?
But, see, the only reason they fired him
is because people were gossiping,
and the only reason they're gossipg is
because of what I told Mrs. McCluskey.
Yeah, and you told me
to spread the word.
So that people could watch
their kids and be vigilant.
So you wanna wait until he
actually molests one of our kids?
Whose side are you on, Lynette?
Knock it off, gert.
Remember,
if it weren't for Lynette,
We never would've found
out about this creep.
She's our hero.
...The 22-Yard line,
the give is to Harrison,
who is hit immediately
and dropped for a loss
in his own backfield...
Bye-bye, Daddy.
See you, sweetie.
Have fun.
So I was, uh,
I was thinking you...
You wanna grab a cup of coffee
or something after class?
I'd love to grab
a cup of coffee...
or something.
Amy, you are so lucky
to have such a nice Dad.
Yeah, I know.
Leave him alone.
Excuse me?
You heard me.
I don't want
you dating him.
Oh, sweetheart.
I have a feeling
I know what this is about.
No you don't.
I think I do.
You miss your Mommy,
and it feels funny seeing your
Daddy be nice to somebody else.
But believe me, I'm not trying
to replace your Mom.
Well, I am,
And I have someone
all picked out.
What?
I want my Dad to
marry Sherri's Mom.
Sherri from class?
We're best friends, and
we have it all planned out.
Our parents are
gonna get married,
and then we'll
be real sisters.
What about your Dad?
Don't you care what he wants?
My Mom died.
All my Dad wants
is for me to be happy.
Now get in there and teach
me how to work the runway.
That's what we're
paying you for, right?
...Runs it left,
swings it around.
He fights his way to the
25 for another first down,
and that should
just about do it.
I tell you, with 1:12 left on the clock
and no time-outs remaining...
Orson?
Bree?
Orson.
Why haven't you
returned any of my calls?
I was afraid you were calling
to ask me for a divorce.
No, I wasn't.
They arrested Mike for the
murder of Monique Polier.
They did?
The other night, you wanted
a chance to explain everything.
Well, here it is,
and I want it all.
If I find out you've left anything out,
then I will ask for that divorce.
Okay.
You're working so hard, Sherri.
You must really wanna win this pageant.
More than anything.
Well, I think dedication
should be rewarded,
so I have a little
surprise for you.
What is it?
Well, you know how the pageant
starts with a big opening number?
This year, all the contestants
are gonna dance in pairs,
and I've arranged for you to
dance with your best friend Amy!
What's wrong, sweetie?
Well...
Amy sucks.
Well, I thought you two
were practically sisters?
We are...
but she still sucks.
And first impressions
are everything.
You said so yourself.
Well, that's true...
And this is the opening number.
If the judges see me tripping all over
that klutz, there's no way I'm gonna win.
That's a good point.
Now I wish I hadn't told Amy.
You already told her?!
She was so excited.
Well, she's
your best friend.
Why don't you just tell her
the truth? She'll understand.
What if she doesn't?
Well, friends come and go...
but a crown is forever.
I never loved Alma.
My mother pushed
us together, and,
I was stupid enough
to get her pregnant.
You had a child?
Alma miscarried a month
after the wedding.
I was trapped.
Well, you could've left her.
Mother wouldn't hear of it.
Divorce is a sin.
So I stayed in
the marriage,
hoping I would come to feel
what I was supposed to,
but I never did.
So I resigned myself
to a life without love.
And then I met Monique.
It was wrong.
I didn't care.
I loved her more than
I'd loved anyone...
Till you.
So why couldn't
you tell me this?
Because you told
me about Rex.
How he cheated on you,
how hurt you were.
Bree, I needed you
to feel safe with me.
Well, you haven't
done a very good job.
Handling the truth would have
been a hundred times easier
than dealing with all
the doubt and suspicion.
So you stayed in a loveless
marriage because of your mother?
I know how it sounds.
But after my
father died,
she was all I had.
His death caused
me so much pain...
I would've done
anything for her.
She saw that weakness,
and she ran with it.
You've got no idea how
manipulative she can be.
She ruins lives.
Now I've told you
everything.
What happens now?
Well...
First you pack up your
things and come home,
and then...
we toss your mother
out on her evil ass.
God, I love you.
Hi! I'm so
sorry I'm late.
Where are your folks?
They're not coming.
Their plane was
snowed in at O'Hare.
Well, that's too bad.
Well, no harm done then, huh?
You're 40 minutes late.
But they're not here.
You didn't know that.
And where's dinner?
Bree and I sort
of had a fight.
Look, I'm awfully sorry that
I'm late. I had an emergency.
Did this emergency have
anything to do with Mike?
I'm pretty sure that Bree's husband murdered
the woman the cops think Mike killed.
I went to his office...
Oh, for God sakes, Susan.
No, I found
evidence. Look.
Orson was committed to a
mental institution for over a year.
I mean, doesn't that suggest
he's some sort of...
I don't care!
Tonight meant a great deal
to me, and you blew it off.
I said I was sorry, Ian.
I have to help Mike.
I'm all he's got.
Actually, you're wrong.
He's got me.
What?
Tomorrow, I'll hire the best
lawyer in town to defend him,
and I'll pay every
cent of his bill.
You would do that for Mike?
Yes, on one condition...
You can't see
him anymore.
Why?
If you start visiting him,
being a friend to him,
he'll fall in love
with you again.
Then you'll have to decide whose
heart to break, his or mine.
As jealous ultimatums go,
that's very flattering, but,
I don't think
that's necessary.
Mike and I are done.
Then you should have no problem
accepting my generous offer.
You would really get him
the best lawyer in town?
An absolute piranha.
Do we have a deal?
Well, okay then.
You know, Mike barely
remembers me.
What makes you so sure he would
fall in love with me again?
What a perfectly
asinine question.
How could he not?
God, I was only
in the house 15 minutes.
Are there more
of them now?
Yep.
Go ahead, say it.
I know you want to.
This is all your fault.
You should've listened to me.
I know.
But be fair. There is no way
I could've anticipated this.
You tell people
Frankenstein's on the loose,
then you're surprised to see
the torch-wielding villagers?
I'm putting the kids to bed early.
I don't want 'em to see this.
Is that an ambulance?
I can't believe
you're doing this!
Amy, don't you want
me to have a chance?
God, I hate you!
I hate you!
Don't ever talk
to me again!
Hi. Bill?
I was wondering, do you
have plans Saturday night?
What... Excuse me, can you
tell me what happened?
Ma'am, I need
you to step back.
Okay.
We're brinng in
a female, late 30s.
And get crash cart ready.
She's in cardiac arrest.
There he is.
There he is.
Stop it! Stop it! You can't do this to
people! Have you lost your minds?!
Well, excuse us for wanting
to feel safe in our own homes.
Well, that's my home, and
I don't feel very safe right now.
Please, please, all of you,
just leave this street.
Please, I beg of you. Go!
Just get off my
street, please!
Wait, wait!
Art, wait, I'm sorry...
I'm sorry.
You're an idiot
to take him back.
I am no longer interested
in your opinion.
I thought
I made that clear.
Where are you
sending me?
Oh, we've rented you a condo
in a lovely retirement community.
It's our Christmas
gift to you.
So you're exiling me?
Cutting me off from
my new grandcldren?
That's our gift
to them.
You think you can be
rid of me that easily?
It's over, mother.
I told her everything.
Oh, I doubt
that very much.
You still have
secrets, my boy.
So do you, mother,
And if you want them
kept, you'll keep mine.
It's me. I have some bad news.
She's taking him back.
Meet me on the
corner in an hour.
We need to
deal with this.
I heard about
Rebecca on the news.
If there's anything
I can do to help, I...
With the funeral
arrangements, or, uh...
help you call relatives...
Wow.
You must be feeling
really guilty.
Of course!
I feel just terrible.
I mean, if you knew, if you
could just know how sorry I am.
Hey.
You know,
in a weird way...
I should thank you.
My sister was...
a really wonderful person.
She always saw
the best in me.
But there were things
she couldn't see...
Or chose not to,
God love her.
What do you mean?
I think you know.
See, I always knew that I
had to take care of Rebecca,
so I could never
let myself...
slip and do something
that would hurt her.
But now...
I'm free...
And all because of you.
You can't stay here.
Oh, don't worry.
I'm already packed.
Where are you going?
Why, you gonna write?
Well...
Good-bye, Lynette.
You take care of that
beautiful family of yours.
There's a reason people
can't wait for Christmas,
and it has little to do
with family reunions...
Or curling up with
a cup of eggnog...
Or that unexpected kiss
beneath the mistletoe...
Or receiving a present
from that special someone.
No, people look
forward to Christmas,
because they
know it's a time...
for miracles.
Hello, Alma.
Don't just stand there.
Tell me everything.
Previously on Desperate Housewives
I will love her like she is my own.
Lynette made a promise...
his wife goes missing,and his mistress turns up dead?
I just can't believe that orson could do such a thing.
Mike got arrested...
oh,thank god!
And a friendship hit the rocks.
I am not playing with a woman that is willing
to let mike take the fall for her psycho husband.
Susan made a deal...
I'll hire the best lawyer in town on one condition-
you can't see him anymore.
And a missing wife returned.
Hello,alma.
to understand the journey of alma hodge,
you first need to know how it started.
It began the day she wed orson hodge,
a man she had tricked into marriage by getting pregnant.
Alma was confident that as their family grew,
orson's feelings for her would grow as well.
But then something went wrong,
and the baby she had been counting on never came.
So alma found herself married
to a man who seemed to despise her.
Still,alma hoped things would get better...
mama loves her baby.
Es the baby love mama?
Until the day she discovered orson was having an affair.
And alma realized the only way she'd ever
get her husband to appreciate her
was to leave him...
immediately.
if you don't get back in your cage right now,
I'm gonna have to leave you behind.
Please!
going somewhere?
I'm staying at a motel tonight.
Why?
I don't have time to discuss it.
I'm late for the bus.
All right.
I'm going away because...
I know you're having an affair.
Ah.
I see.
Aren't you even gonna deny it?
On the contrary.
I wanna shout it from the rooftops!
For the first time in my life,I'm actually in love.
How can you say that to me?
I'm your wife!
We both know why we got married,
and it had nothing to do with affection.
So you don't care if I go?
No.
Wait!
This isn't what's supposed to happen!
You should be begging me to stay with you.
I deserve to be happy,alma.
So do you.
And we're clearly not gonna find that together.
Orson,no!
It was at that moment alma realized
it wasn't enough to leave her husband.
He had to be punished.
Yes,this was the journey of alma hodge...
bree hodge?
I'm alma hodge.
I believe we have someone in common.
and it wasn't over yet.
There is a time of day all housewives look forward to.
It occurs just after the chores have been completed
and right before the children come home from school.
It's a time for good friends to get together,
have a cup of coffee and exchange gossip
aboutthe other good friends who couldn't make it that day.
Bree letrson move back in.
You're kidding. When?
Yesterday.
I'm so disappointed in her.
Well,the police did arrest mike.
I mean,I know you think he's innocent,
but surely you can understand why bree's feelings have changed.
Well,mine haven't,
and I know something that bree probably doesn'T.
When orson was 17,he spent time in a mental institution.
How did you find that out?
I snuck into his office and rifled through his things.
Of course you did.
But that doesn't prove he had anything
to do with monique's murder.
No,but it's a piece of the puzzle.
I mean,he did have an affair with her.
And when you combine that with
the fact that his first wife went missing...
so you're alma.
Where have you been all this time?
In canada.
My aunt lives there.
Well,you should've told someone.
People thought you were dead.
Some even thought that orson killed you.
Well,that's sort of what I wanted them to think.
That's why I left my bird behind and only took cash,
so they couldn't trace me through my credit cards.
So you deliberately framed orson?
I'm not saying it was my finest hour.
But you have to understand,orson hurt me very badly.
He cheated on me.
Yes,I know-
with monique polier.
And I thought,if I disappeared,
she'd get scared and leave him,like he left me.
Isn't jealousy awful?
So why have you come back?
I found this fantastic therapist.
He told me that by holding on to my anger
I was really just hurting myself,which was hard to deny.
I mean,hello,I'm here in winnipeg
with a deaf aunt and no credit.
So I thought,it's time to make amends.
Darling?
Mrs. Mclean canceled,so...
I'm free for lunch.
Um,actually,we have a guest.
hello,orson.
Oh,hello...
so...
what is it with you and redheads?
I I hope you don't mind me springing this picnic on you.
I figured it'd be more fun than some stuffy restaurant.
Are you kidding?
What could be more romantic?
Back off,you son of a bitch!
more wine?
Yes,keep it coming.
hello?
hey,who's the dork?
Carlos?
What's with that cap?
extra,extra,read all about it!
Where the hell are you?
What are you doing at mike's house?
I live here.
What do you mean you live there?
Since when?
Gaby,my car's been in the driveway for three weeks.
Even you can't be that self-absorbed.
Well,as you can see,
I have more pleasant things to focus on.
So when you gonna tell jimmy olsen
there that you hate picnics?
I'm gonna hang up noW.
So where were we?
Your ex-husband moved in across the street?
What's that gonna be like?
yeah?!
Are you gonna kiss him?
That's right,carlos.
We have had some pblems with raccoons
getting into the trash.
So why don't you just put a lid on it?
Okay,they're here.
Now listen,stand up.
Kayla has been through a lot,
so when she walks in the door,
I want you to make her feel welcome,okay?
Give her a hug and be really nice.
I'm giving her my room.
How much nicer do I have to be?
Well,nicer than that,
or she's gonna get alyour toys,too.
hey,hey,hey!
Hi!
Look who I found wandering around the airport.
Hi,kayla! We missed you!
We're so glad you're here.
okay,boys.
Good. Yeah,okay.
So give her some room.
Hey,wow,look,are those presents for kayla?
Yes,they are.
Hey,look at that. Preston gave you a harmonica.
Isn't that cool?
Oh. "Harriet the spy.  Sounds mysterious.
Thanks.
And what did you get for her,porter?
A video game,but I get to play it whenever I want.
Porter!
I you know what?
I got you something,too.
This...
is nellie.
My grandma gave her to me when I was little,
and I was hoping you could take care of her for me.
Thanks.
Hey,honey,why don't you take
your stuff and go upstairs and,
uh,get ready for lunch,okay?
I'm gonna ma some chili.
Okay,daddy.
Okay,baby.
HoneY...
that was so sweet...
to give her your doll.
She didn't seem that knocked out by it.
Well,just give her some time.
She'll-
she'll come around.
It's a tough adjustment.
Okay.
I must say,bree,I don't know when
I've tasted such moist pound cake.
Sour cream.
So whatever happened to my parrot?
I set it free.
Orson,they don't fair well in the wild.
You should've-
,for god sake,alma,who cares about the damn bird?
You set me up.
Why don't I wrap up a piece of
this pound cake for you to enjoy later?
Do you have any idea what you put me through?
You almost ruined my life.
You've rebounded nicely.
Bree's lovely.
Don't change the subject.
You put me through a lot,too,orson,but I forgave you.
Can't we just put this behind us?
And that's all you've come back for-
closure?
Of course.
What else?
I'm out of lipstick.
Can I borrow yours?
Sure.
Cherry berry?
austin likes the way it tastes.
Oh,i so did not need to know that.
So,um,where you going?
Down to the jailhouse to talk to mike.
But didn't you tell ian you wouldn't see him anymore?
Yeah.
But somebody's gotta tell him about his new lawyer.
Otherwise,the guy's gonna show up,and he's gonna go,
"who the hell is he?
ian gets that.
besides...
why would it be a big deal?
Mike and I are over.
I was just wondering,'cause,
you know,you're putting on lipstick to go to a prison.
Thank you for clearing things up.
Oh,well,it was the least I could do.
Orson,I'm truly sorry for the pain I've caused,
and if there's anything else I can do...
actually,there is.
I'd love it if you could join us for dinner this weekend.
There are some friends that I'm just...
dying for you to meet.
you got me a lawyer?
Yeah,and he is fantastic.
You cannot believe the scum he has gotten off.
Not that you're scum.
But,you know,if you were,you'd be sitting pretty.
I'm paying you back-
every penny.
Oh,well,you know,we'll figure that out later.
I I can't believe that I just
listened to all that stuff edie told me about you,
and it turns out you're the only one standing by me.
You're a good friend,susan.
Um,yeah,about that...
it's ian.
He's not crazy about me spending time with my ex.
Even an ex who doesn't remember dating you?
I remember,and I guess that's enough for him.
I'm sorry.
Well,I,uh,can't say that I blame him.
Take care of yourself,mike.
You,too,susan.
dinner's ready.
Kayla,I made your favorite-
tacos.
here you go.
But where's my daddy?
Oh,sorry,sweetheart.
He's working late,trying to get the restaurant ready.
Oh,lovely,parker.
Go wash your hands. Go on.
Kayla,where you going?
To watch tv.
Oh,sweetie,we don't watch tv during dinner.
But my show is on.
Well,I'm sorry.
Those are the rules.
My mommy let me.
Well...
just this once.
Okay,okay,I know what you're thinking,but...
kayla's going through a hard time right now.
Come and sit down.
Letting her watch tv is like me letting
you eat ice cream when you're sick.
But she's not sick.
Well,that's true,but she's sad.
I'm sad I n't watch tv.
eat your tacos.
Whoa,whoa,whoa!
Sit your butts down!
It's not fair.
I don't care.
We have rules.
Well,she gets to.
She is special.
Now sit down.
Come on.
does she get dessert,too?
Of course I do.
what an amazing documentary,huh?
Yoknow,I read the director shot over 400 hours of film.
Really?
I only counted half that.
I get it.
You pick the next one.
Okay.
look at you!
Who knew you were such a romantic?
Actually,I...
I didn't send them.
You didn't?
So,uh,who's making me look bad?
Uh,there's no signature.
sorry.
This is kind of awkward.
No,I-I don't care who worships you from afar,
as long as I get to do it up close.
that's sweet that you're not...
jealous.
Carlos would've hit the roof if some guy sent me...
would you excuse me a minute?
Nice try,carlos.
Huh?
Oh,don't act innocent.
You know you sent me these flowers.
why would I get you flowers?
To sabotage my new relationship.
Oh,with picnic boy?
What do I care if you go out with him?
Oh,you care.
First,you move across the street.
And then,earlier today,I catch you spying on me-
I was not spying.
I was mocking you.
You need to move on,carlos.
I have moved on!
You're the one talking to your ex during the middle of a date.
Is he that boring?
Bill is not boring.
He is vibrant...
And-
and sexy.
And yet here you are.
she threw your doll in the trash?
No.
First,she ripped off its arms,stuffed it with ili.
Then she threw it in the trash.
So what did you do?
Nothing.
And this is after you let her watch tv during dinner?
Well,I didn't know what else to do.
I'm trying to win over a little girl
who clearly doesn't want a new mother.
Well,I guess giving her special treatment
isn't gonna Ive anything.
You know what might solve something?
If you were home once in a while.
You're the one she listens to.
I am trying to open up a restaurant.
Our life savings is riding on this thing.
I know,I know.
I know.
You know what?
I don't want you to be afraid to take a firm hand with kayla.
She's part of our family now,and...
you know what that means.
Yeah.
I should treat her as badly as I treat my own children.
Exactly.
sorry.
Um...
I'm not sure I'M...
ready for that yet.
That's cool.
You can't blame me for trying,though.
Austin,you know I want to.
It's just...
hey,don't sweat it.
All right,if you're not ready,you're not ready.
So he didn't pressure you at all?
What a great guy.
I know. I'm so lucky.
Underneath all that bad boy posturing,he'S...
a real gentleman.
Wow,you're not only virgin.
You think like one.
Beat it,eavesdropper.
No,wait.
Um...
what did you mean by that?
Well,uh...
guys need sex. All right?
It's basic science.
So if he's not getting it from you,
he'll end up getting it somewhere else.
You're a moron.
Not all guys pressure girls for sex.
Yeah,gay guys don'T.
But austin's not gay,not even after three beers.
don't ask.
So what's your point?
If a guy has to wait too long to see you naked,
he'll end up seeing you as a friend.
Again...
science.
Don't listen to him.
You hold on to your virginity.
If austin won't wait,then he doesn't deserve you.
I just don't wanna lose him.
It's better than ling your self-respect.
Take it from a girl who's known at school as
"little miss van de tramp.
I thought you made that up.
Only 'cause it was nicer than the other
names they were calling me.
I really appreciateyou donating this stuff.
Anything for a good cause.
Everyone at the shelter's gonna be so excited.
Yeah.
I mean,to you and me,these are just a bunch of old clothes.
But to a homeless woman...
It's a chance r her to feel pretty again.
You okay?
What?
I asked if you're okay.
You seem kind of distracted.
I...
am fine.
Yes,I just remembered today's my mother's birthday.
can we stop by the florist on the way to the shelter?
Yeah.
Detective ridley,my name is susan mayer,
and I'm calling to "drop a dime" on someone.
That's the expression,right?
Yes,ma'am.
You've got the lingo down pat.
Good.
Uh...
his name is orson hodge,and he had an affair
with the woman that you think mike delfino killed.
Monique polier?
Are you sure? Because...
Mr. Hodge saw her body in the morgue.
He acted like he didn't know her.
Well,he does,and so he's pretending he didn'T.
That's suspicious,right?
Well,um.
oh,uh,can you hold on?
Hello?
Susan. Hi.
It's bree.
Bree?Uh...
hi.
Can you hold on a second?
It's orson's wife.
She can't know I called you.
Then how about you don't tell her?
Right.
Sorry. Uh,
I'm just new to this whole snitch thing.
Hold on,okay?
Bree, hi.
Sorry about that. Damn telemarketer.
So what can I do for you?
I just feel really awful about our fight,
and I-I think it's time for an apology.
Bree, I am so relieved.
Would you join orson and me for
dinner tomorrow night?
Oh, uh... sure.
Good. I'll see you at 8:00.
Bree...
I just want you to know that no matter what,
your friendship means the world to me.
Oh, susan, you know,I feel exactly-
it's me again.
You should also know that
orson spent a year in an asylum.
hi. Can I help you?
Hi. I received some flowers
from your shop yesterday
and the card didn't say who they were from.
Can you check The name is solis.
Sure, sure. Just give me a sec here.
Solis?
Yeah.
Solis... solis...
huh. This is odd.
The buyer asked to remain anonymous.
Really? Uh, well,the flowers were so beautiful,
I'd like to know who to thank.
Sorry. I have to honor their request.
Why? They're just flowers.
They're not government secrets.
If you don't mind,I'm busy.
Well, okay, wait, wait, wait,let me explain.
What's to explain?
A pretty girl gets flowers.
Do you know how many girls never get flowers?
I work in a flower shop.
I've never gotten anfreakin' flowers!
So stop your whining about
who sent them and just be glad he did.
you're right,and I am so sorry for
taking up so much of your time.
Sorry for doing this.
Hey! What the hell are you doing?
hey, hey, hey!
I'm gonna make it up to you, okay?
Once I'm done, I'll send you flowers.
Hey! You won't get away with is!
I know where you live!
Yeah? Well, stop by. We'll hot tub.
Hey, mister, help!
She locked me in here!
Gaby?
This is totally her fault.
I mean, I simply asked her
if carlos sent me the flowers,
and she refused to show me the order slip.
Are you still hung up on that?
For god sake.
No, no, no!Wait, wait, wait.
I just need a couple more minutes.
I need to know the truth.
What truth is that, huh?
That you're still obsessed with your ex-husband?
What?!No, he's obsessed with me.
You just imprisoned a florist to
find out if he sent you roses.
Okay, I see what you mean.
there. I'm done.
Let's go.
Actually...
I think I'm done, too.
I'm sorry.
It's okay.
I'm probably not ready to date.
thanks.
And just so you know,i am ready to date.
All right, let's hit it.
Now come on, kayla.
I haven't finished my ice cream.
Well, I'm sorry,but we gotta go.
I have a dinner party I have to get to.
They got to finish their ice cream.
Well, they, you know,wolfed it down
like kids are supposed to.
So... hurry it up.
kayla,I'm not fooling around.
We-we're going.
Mm-hmm. Okay.
Boys, go to the car.
I'll be out in a minute. Go.
Listen, sweetheart, I don't blame you for being angry.
Your mom's gone,and you're stuck with me.
But...
the last thing she said to me was,
"promise you'll take care of kayla,"
and I am going to.
But you're gonna have to help me, okay?
We can leave when I'm done.
Okay, let's go.
hey, whoa!Whoa, whoa, whoa! Okay.
What the hell are you doing?!
Stop, stop! Stop screaming!Stop!
Leave me alone!
You're not my mommy!
guys, how would you like to eat dinner
in front of the television for a whole week?
What are you guys doing here?
kayla, stop screaming!
You're hurting my ears!
Get in the car!
Come on!We're going home!
Get your seat belt on!
Kids-they're always rough housing.
why'd you stop?
Well, uh, it's getting late.
I got your blouse unbuttoned.
That's usually when we call it a night.
Do you wanna call it a night?
What, do you wanna grab a pizza or something?
I wanna do what... you wanna do.
Well... you know what I wanna do.
Well, okay.
Are you sure?
Yeah, I'm sure.
you can always spot the new guys
by the way they pick through their food.
So what did you do when you thought
no one was looking?
The cops say I killed a woman.
But you didn't, right?
Actually, I have no idea.
I got pretty banged up in an accide.
The last two years are a blank.
Well... that's a fresh approach.
I'm not sure the jury's gonna swallow it.
It's the truth.
I believe you.
Okay, mrS. Mccluskey's downstairs,and
we will be right across the street if you need us.
Okay, daddy.
You know, I heard what happened with lynette today.
Hey, she's doing her best.
Why you being so hard on her?
'Cause it's her fault my mommy died.
No. No, no, honey. It's not.
Mom only went to that store because
lynette was trying to steal me.
Okay, that is not true.
Look, honey, it is way more complicated than that.
I know you miss your mommy
and she loved you very much.
But guess what?
Lynette loves you, too.
That's why you gotta give her a chance.
Can you do that for me?
Okay. I'll be good.
That's my girl.
But I'm never gonna love her...
and you can't make me.
Well, you've won.
What did I win?
Bill and I split up.
Can't say I'm surprised.
He wasn't right for you.
I know.
So just admit you sent the flowers.
I didn'T.
Carlos, just tell me.
I won't be mad. I promise.
Gaby, if I was gonna send you flowers,
I wouldn't send you pink roses.
I'd send you white orchids,
because I know they're your favorite.
And if I wanted to cheer you up-sunflowers.
And for the flu...
blue irises.
I hate that you know me so well,
and it took so long for that to happen.
Now I have to start over again with somebody else.
Yeah.
That's what dating's for.
I know, and it sucks.
I mean, you saw me. I went on a picnic
and ate pudding out of a can.
It was horrible.
well, if it makes you feel any better,
I dragged to the ballet the other night.
So you are dating.
That's why you've been lifting weights and jogging.
Well, if you wanna bag the big game,
gotta work on the guns.
I'll give you this-
you're gonna be a tough act to follow, carlos.
Back at yard, babe.
I'm so sorry to keep you waiting,
but I don't want to introduce
you until all my guests are here.
I don't mind.
By the way, when my friends ask you what happened-
and they will-
I don't think it's necessary to go into all that
unpleasantness about orson and monique.
All they need to know is that
you're back and we're on good terms.
And orson didn't kill me.
And orson didn't kill you.
oh, okay, just one minute. That'll be susan.
Hi. I brought you a bundt cake.
Don't worry. I didn't make it.
Oh, you didn't have to do that.
I was really touched by your call.
It was so big of you.
Well, when you're wrong,you're wrong.
Now that we're all assembled,
I'd like to introduce the guest of honor.
I hope you'll all be as delighted
to meet her as I was.
You can come in now.
Everyone,this is alma hodge,orson's first wife.
Oh, about that apology...
any time you're ready.
So you have been in canada this entire time?
Well, my aunt agnes has a place in winnipeg.
I hadn't planned on staying slong,
but I needed the time to find myself.
It would've been nice if someone
else could've found you.
There was a whole lot of drama around here.
Yes, I heard.
People actually thought orson had done away with me?
amazing, isn't it,where some people's minds will go?
Well, you gotta hand it to her.
Just when u think bree's thrown
every conceivable theme party
she hosts a "shame on you for
thinking my husband killed someone" dinner.
So alma's alive. Big deal.
We still don't know what went down
between orson and monique.
susan, please. We look stupid enough for suspecting him.
Just let it go.
It may be a little late for that.
Detective ridley.
Can I help you?
Yes. I'd like to speak to your husband.
Oh, well,I'm afraid he's not here,
but I will be happy to tell him that you came by.
who is it, darling?
excuse us.
Can't this wait?We're having a dinner party.
hello, dr. Hodge.
Detective ridley.
We need you to come with us.
We have some questions about that jane doe
we showed you in the morgue.
Why do you think I'd know anything about her?
Well, you were having an affair
with her when she died.
Oh, where did you hear that?
Susan?
I didn't know they were gonna come tonight.
Uh, I'm happy to answer any questions
that you might have.
My apologies. Please, stay.
Enjoy the dessert.
I don't believe this.
You called the police?
Well, obviously,you weren't going to.
They needed to know that that
dead woman was orson's mistress.
I told you that in confidence.
Did you seriously think I could sit on information
that would exonerate mike?
I mean, if you had seen his face
in jail the other day...
the other day?You-you saw mike?
Yeah. I-just to tell him about the lawyer.
I know that mike is innocent.
Right, just like you knew she was dead.
I thought we had an agreement.
We do. Can we talk about this later?
When?
After your next conjugal visit?
Ian. Wait!
Boy, when it comes to mike
there's no one you won't betray.
Excuse me?
Hey, guys...
please leave my house.
Bree!
You heard me. Get out!
Okay, bree,I know you're angry,
but for the sake of our friendship-
oh, make no mistake,our friendship is over.
Okay. You go...
okay.
So, winnipeg... must get pretty cold up there.
I'm just getting my coat.
Ian, please, I just lost one of my best friends.
I can't lose you, too.
You said that you wouldn't see him again.
But you had to know that I would go
one more time to just explain everything.
Actually, no, I didn'T.
Well, that's just crazy!
Why are you acting like a crazy person?
Because you've already left me once for this-this guy!
Things are different now!
I I love you!
You-you don't have to worry about that anymore.
If we're gonna make this relationship work
then you have to trust me
and why are you smiling at me?
You just said that you love me.
Yeah? So?
Well, you've never said that before.
Yes, I have.
No. I-I-I would've remembered.
Well, I'm saying it now. I love you.
Do you have a problem with that?
No, ma'am.
You-you-you can't kiss me now.
I'm yelling at you.
Well, I'm listening.
Well... don't-don't think that
you can get out of this,
you know, by just... oh, god. Oh, yeah, uh,
oh, yeah, right-right there. Oh, right there.
look, I think we should stop doing thiS.
I know it's my idea,but it just
doesn't feel right anymore.
So you slept with julie. It's no big deal.
Well, it is to her
and I don't want to see her get hurt.
Me, either.
so let's just not tell her.
there's no place in fair view
that's more peaceful.
All the floors are hardwood.
Oh, there are brand-new appliances.
And the gardens are...
well, they're beautiful.
So... what do you think?
I'll take it.
Really?
that's terrific!
I'll draw up the papers in the morning.
If you don't mind me asking,
why were you so interested in this particular street?
I've been moving around a lot in the last few months,
and I need a place where I can really settle down.
You know what I mean?
I wanna live in a place
where children know how to behave,
where people still have some sense of moral value,
and where friendships are good
and strong and last forever.
That's what I'm looking for.
Then I think wisteria lane is the place for you.
Good.
More than anything,I just wanna fit in.
oh, you will, alma.
You absolutely will.
Previously on Desperate Housewives...
The last two years
are a blank.
That's a fresh approach.
I believe you.
Mike couldn't place
a familiar face...
Whoever killed her...
The police couldn't
identify a murder victim...
Pulled out all her teeth.
There's no signature.
Gabrielle was getting
showered with gifts...
Buyer asked to
remain anonymous.
From a mystery suitor.
I'm gonna open up
a pizza parlor!
And Lynette
couldn't believe...
Oh, dear God.
What her husband
had done.
I wanna do what...
you wanna do.
Julie's first love
was two-timing her,
And Orson's first wife...
I'm Alma Hodge.
Wasn't going away...
What do you think?
I'll take it.
Anytime soon.
Your average housewife
worries constantly
about the dangerous people
she sees on the nightly news.
Which is why she buy
expensive alarm systems,
carries pepper spray
in her purse,
and keeps a gun
in her drawer,
so she can go about her day
feeling safe and protected.
Your average inmate
worries constantly
about the dangerous people
he comes in contact with every day.
Which is why
he takes ordinary items,
And turns them
into weapons,
that he always
keeps handy,
so he can go about his day
feeling safe and protected.
What is the difference between
the housewife and the inmate?
The inmate knows
the feeling won't last long.
Delfino, right?
Yeah.
So?
Come on, brah,
let's go.
You okay?
Yeah.
I owe you one.
Yeah. I guess you do.
Yes, we all need protection
from those who
would do us harm...
And sometimes from
those who protect us.

Wild parties.
Handsome strangers.
Tender kisses.
I had a great time.
Bye.
Yes, there were
many things
Gabrielle Solis liked
about being single again...
But coming home to
an empty house...
was not one of them.
What?
Hi. You're sleeping
at my place tonight.
Really?
What did you
have in mind?
God, I hate myife.
Honestly, did you think
I was gonna sleep with you?
It would be the polite
way to thank me.
Carlos, this isn't funny.
I am scared to death
of this maniac.
Since when?
Yesterday you were loving
all the presents, the intrigue.
The guy broke
into the house.
He went from secret
admirer to stalker.
For all I know, he's trying to kill me
so no one else will have me.
Why don't you just
call the cops?
And tell them what?
"911, sobody broke in the house
and left a 6,000 dollars dress. "
Okay, so if this guy
shows up again,
what am I supposed
to do, exactly?
Nothing. Just having
you here helps.
Now that's very sweet.
Because when he breaks in and starts
hacking you up with his machete,
your screams will wake me up,
and then I'll be able escape.
Glad I could help.
Hey, stranger.
Hey.
You have good timing.
I just got all the
kids to sleep.
Ah, damn,
I wanted to tuck 'em in.
Well, you could
tuck me in.
I thought I smelled
your sex perfume.
Come here. Hi.
Hi.
Hi.
Oh, oh, oh. Wait a minute,
wait a minute.
Don't get me all
revived up just yet.
The printer said he was gonna drop
off my menu on his way home.
He already did.
Oh, you didn't look
at that, did you?
'Cause it's just
a mock-up.
Too late. I looked...
and it's great.
Really?
Yes. I love the font,
the color, everything.
I am so jazzed
to see the restaurant.
It is so good
to hear that.
So... any idea
when that might be?
Sure.
How about...
two weeks?
Hey.
You open in
two weeks.
Yeah. Well, that'd be a good
time for you to come by,
'cause there's free refills,
balloons, music...
Might there be
a V.I.P. preview
for people, say,
who bore your children?
Lynette...
Yeah?
I don't want you to see it
until it's all done.
Why not?
Because you will take
one look at the place
and then you'll have all
these tips and suggestions
that you just won't be able
to keep to yourself.
You think?
'Cause I just saw
a take-out menu with
a 6-digit phone number,
and I kept that to myself.
See? There it is! That snarky,
know-it-all attitude.
What? I am snarky because I point
out one small, glaring mistake?
That's it.
Now you're banned
from the opening.
Fine! Good night.
So... we're not
having sex?
Hey, you banned me
from your opening.
All I'm saying is that I'd
feel a lot safer on the pill.
But if you're not 18,
you need parental consent.
Do we really need to give your
mother another reason to hate me?
She'll hate you a lot worse
if you get me... Hey!
Hi.
Hi
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
Can't we just keep using condoms
and be extra careful?
Are you crazy?
They're not dependable.
Sure, they are. Why do you
think everybody uses them?
They all have to
pass inspection.
It's too risky.
Condoms are only
85% effective.
Mom!
Mom, what happened?
Are you okay?
Oh! I was just, uh...
I lost an earring.
Mom, you're wearing
both your earrings.
Oh! I found it.
Austin, I would like to talk
to my daughter privately.
Sure. Call me later.
Why were you two
talking about condoms?
Why were you
eavesdropping?
Don't change
the subject.
Are you two
having sex?
Because I thought that I raised
you to be smarter than that.
Don't you realize that
sex is not fun and games?
It's dangerous.
Every time you turn around,
there's a new disease.
Do you want it to burn
when you pee?
Mom! Mom!
Sex kills!
What?
I'm not having sex.
Really?
Really.
Oh, thank God.
If you're not having sex, why were
you talking about condoms?
Because we know two
kids at school who are,
and they're only
using condoms,
which really stupid because
condoms are only 85% effective.
Yes. That's right.
A condom alone
will not protect you.
I totally agree.
Bree!
Alma!
I didn't know that
you knew Edie.
I told your friends at that dinner party
I was looking for a new house.
A house?
Yes, and Gaby
introduced us.
Oh. Well, um...
I don't want
to keep you.
I'm sure that Edie has lots
of other houses to show you.
Nope. We're done.
Alma took one look at the
Applewhite house, am bam...
love at first sight.
What?
We're gonna
be neighbors.
No!
I mean...
I mean, no, Alma,
you can't buy this house.
Why not?
Well, are you aware
of its history?
The previous owner...
was harboring a murderer.
It was her son.
Say what you like,
she was a great Mom.
They had a dungeon
in the basement.
I mean, people say they still hear
groans coming from the house night.
They're gonna hear groans coming
from your house if you don't zip it.
Don't worry, Alma,
I'm sure that, uh,
Edie can find you a house that
won't give you nightmares.
It's too late, Bree.
I've fallen in love
with this neighborhood.
And as for that haunted house
stuff, well, that's just silly.
People don't come
back from the dead.
Don't I wish.
I will not have that
woman as a neighbor.
You have got
to do something.
I said I'd talk to her.
So what are you
waiting for?
The house is dark.
She's not there.
Oh, so you're just gonna
wait until she moves in?
I will deal with it.
Bree, please calm down.
How can I be calm?!
For months, people thought
you killed your first wife.
No sooner does she show up
and clear your name,
than the police haul you off
to ask you about another murder!
They just had some questions.
Everybody has questions.
Susan and I aren't even
speaking because of it.
Bree, please.
I try to hold my
head up and smile
and just bake more pies
for the church social.
But now your ex is camped
out on our doorstep
like I am hosting some kind
of mormon slumber party,
And I do not know how I am gonna
bake my way out of this one!
Darling,
I swear to you, I will get
Alma out of that house.
I don't care if I have to live up to
my reputation and strangle her.
You're a good husband.
Have you lost
your mind?
I am not getting
you the pill.
Aunt Edie,
Julie and I are in love.
Oh, please. It's not love
you're feeling. It's hormones.
That's not true.
Okay, fine.
If you want to...
express your love, you
don't need to go all the way.
Kiss. Touch. Rub.
I mean, whatever happened
to heavy petting?
It's so underrated.
That's your advice?
Well, I'm sorry. I've never been good
at getting people not to have sex.
So you're not
gonna help us?
Julie, if I do this, your
mother would have my head.
You should
be talking to her.
I can't talk to her.
The whole idea of this
completely freaks her out.
She started screaming,
"sex kills. "
So now it's
all in my lap.
God, she pisses me off.
Look, how about I spring
for a box of condoms?
Will that get you two
off my back?
Condoms are only
85% effective.
Is that true?
Damn. I thought I could coast
all the way to menopause.
Look, we're gonna have sex
whether you help us or not.
We're just trying
to be responsible.
All right.
But just so you know,
the responsible thing
is to abstain from sex
and focus on
your studies.
There. I said it out loud,
just in case anybody asks.
Gaby, I need
another pillow.
All right, don't take the
big one. That's my favorite.
It's only for
one night.
'Cause tomorrow I'm gonna be back
home sleeping in my own bed.
What?!
You can't abandon me!
There's a madman stalking me.
My life is on the line.
Do you know
how scared I am?
You're keeping that?
Hey, I'm scared,
but not of the dress.
Carlos!
Carlos, wake up!
I need you!
Oh, yeah, I thought
you'd come around.
What? No!
Hey!
He's here.
Don't!
Carlos, be careful!
He might have a gun!
I'm unarmed.
Stop kicking me!
Oh, now you're gonna
give me attitude?!
Gaby, we got him.
Maintain.
This jerk has been
terrorizing me.
He broke into
my house!
It was a 6,000
dollars dress,
and my boss didn't want me
leaving it on the porch.
Your boss?
Hey, uh, ahem,
I'm sorry to wake you, sir,
But there was a problem
dropping off the gift.
Yes, and she's, uh,
right here... with me.
This is Gabrielle.
Who the hell is this?
Yes, I got your "token of esteem,"
and I'm not impressed.
Because you're freaking
me out, that's why!
No, I don't care how much it cost.
That's beside the point.
Really? That much?
Tell him if he doesn't stop harassing
you, you're gonna call the cops.
Look, I know you're
trying to be romantic,
but if you keep this up,
I'm gonna be forced...
What'd he say?
That's very
sweet of you,
but I am not the most
beautiful woman in the world.
Tell him you're gonna get
a restraining order on him.
Yes, I may be
in the top ten.
Gaby!
Hey, I'm talking here!
Your voice sounds so
familiar. Do I know you?
He says I know him,
and that he wants to
reintroduce himself at dinner.
Absolutely not.
I would not feel comfortable
meeting for dinner.
Good girl.
How about lunch?
Gaby!
But you have to promise to stop
buying me these expensive gifts.
Because I'm not
that kind of girl.
Well, for that many karats,
yes, I could be
that kind of girl.
Um, I gotta go.
I'll talk to you tomorrow!
Oh, how about that?
And here I was, thinking some guy
wants to murder me in my sleep.
The night's still young.
How are those ribs?
Ah, just needed some tape.
Man, those guys were hard-core.
You really saved my ass.
Don't mention it.
No. Seriously.
Ever anything
I can do for you,
you just say the word.
I'll keep that in mind.
Hey, Delfino.
Yeah, boss?
You might wanna find
yourself another prom date.
Guy's not your friend.
How do you know that?
After those mutts knocked you
around the other day,
Your boy paid 'em off.
You sure?
I saw money
change hands.
Just watch your back.
So I was in the middle
of totally freaking out
when Julie assured me
that she's not having sex.
I can't tell you
how relieved I was.
Uh-huh.
Don't say "uh-huh" like that.
Julie wouldn't lie to me.
She says she's not having sex,
then she's not having sex.
Ooh-kay.
You can't say "ooh-kay"
like that, either.
Julie's not like other girls.
She's a straight-A student.
And you were
valedictorian.
What were you up to that
your mother didn't know about?
Okay, you search the closet.
I'm gonna look under the bed.
Wait, wait, wait.
First rule of ransacking...
Remember where
everything goes.
You are gonna make a really
good mother someday.
So what does this
diary look like?
Uh, it's small.
It's got a plaid cover.
Oh, and when you find it,
you have to read it,
because I promised her that I
would always respect her privacy.
Now help me
flip this mattress.
Oh( Oh, my God!
You found it?
This is adorable!
You think maybe I could...
No, you cannot borrow it.
Fine.
Why does Julie
have a VCR?
To watch movies.
Please. Kids don't watch videos
anymore. Everything's digital.
See? It's just a tape.
Is it?
Alma.
What do you think
you're doing?
Measuring for drapes.
I'm thinking damask.
You know
what I mean.
Why have you
moved here?
Well, it's a very
nice street,
and I've made
friends here.
People have taken
such an interest in me.
Yeah, they thought
you were dead.
The novelty of your not being
a corpse can't last forever.
What are you
after, hmm?
Are you still
punishing me?
You want me to pay
you to leave? What?
I want what I've
always wanted...
You.
I'm married.
And even if I weren't,
I don't love you.
You didn't love
the old Alma.
I'm not that
woman anymore.
I'm stronger,
more confident.
It may take you a while
to see that, but I can wait.
Alma, I love Bree.
But does she love you?
Oh, she may love
the Orson she knows...
But does she know
what you did to Monique?
Does she know you
ran over Mike Delfino?
I know all that.
I still love you.
Would she?
So I see you've
spoken to Mother.
Yes. It's nice to have someone
on my side in all of this.
Don't worry.
I won't tell Bree.
She might go
to the police,
And you're no good
to me in jail.
But if I thought I had
no chance with you,
no chance at all...
Well, there'd be nothing
to stop me from telling.
Please, Orson,
Don't take
away my hope.
She's not going.
Why not?
And what the hell was
that on the porch?!
She kissed me good-bye.
What was I supposed to do, slug her?
You went over there to
read her the right act.
Instead, it looked like you were
reading her a bedtime story.
Bree, I told her
we don't want her here.
I threatened, I shouted.
She refuses to go.
We're just gonna have
to make the best of it.
Hello?
Hey, it's me.
You wanna meet for lunch?
No, honey, I got...
I gotta drive to greendale
to picout napkins.
Remember?
I told you.
Oh. Yeah, that's right.
So I'll, um,
I'll see you tonight.
Okay. Good.
I'll see ya.
Oh... my... God.
Hey, Mrs. Scavo.
Andrew, hi!
I thought you weren't
starting until the opening.
Oh, yeah, there's just so much
work that needs to be done.
Mr. Scavo asked me
to start early.
He's not here,
by the way.
Yeah, I know. And hey,
don't tell him I stopped by.
I'm not supposed to be here.
I just wanted to sneak a peek.
Shouldn't you
be working?
Shouldn't you
not be here?
Touch.
So, uh, how do you
like the place?
I think it's fantastic.
It's really coming together.
Oh, I love the bar.
Oh, yeah, it's, uh,
it's pretty cool.
It's too bad we can't
get a liquor license.
What?
Oh, uh, didn't
Mr. Scavo tell you?
No... he didn't.
Don't, um, restaurants make
half their money on the liquor?
Oh. Yeah. We're
completely screwed.
This is a nightmare.
How did this happen?
The city rezoned and said
he had to get all the residents
within a block to sign a waiver,
and there are
some holdouts.
He's kinda bummin'.
Well, then why isn't he dealing with
it Instead of shopping for napkins?
We could lose our
shirts in this dump!
Is this Dr. Marvin Tashman?
Hi. My name
is Susan Mayer.
My daughter Julie
came in to see you...
Yes, about birth control.
So I'm just curious...
Where do you get off prescribing
that without my consent?!
What?! No, I most
certainly was not there.
What do I look like?
I don't have blonde hair.
Wait, did my blonde
hair have dark roots?
I forgot to give you
the keys to the shed.
You got my daughter
the pill?!
Here. Catch.
Don't you walk
away from me!
Do we have to do this now?
Yes, we do.
You might have gotten your
first diaphragm with milk money,
but that doesn't give you the
right to corrupt my daughter!
Look, it's not like I went
after Julie and said,
"Hey, do you wanna go out for a
burger and some birth control?"
She came to me.
You do not get to
decide this for her!
What were
you thinking?!
I was thinking,
if Julie got knocked up,
that you and I could become
family, and I'm sorry,
I cannot take that chance.
Oh, you know what?
It wasn't till your rotten nephew came
to town that Julie was a perfect kid.
And now she's lying and scheming
and having casual sex!
She's just a boob job
away from being you!
Look, Mayer,
Julie has discovered sex.
The genie is out
of the bottle.
And you better get good with it,
or you could lose her forever.
'Cause like it or not,
she loves him.
And you know
what else?
He loves her.
Your gentleman friend
went to make a call.
He'll be with you shortly.
Thank you.
Gabrielle.
Zach Young!
Oh, my God!
It's been ages.
Look at you!
So handsome in a suit.
You look beautiful.
Aren't you sweet?
Uh, well, anyway,
I'd love to catch up,
but I'm kinda waiting
for someone.
Yes, I know.
So the dress fits. Cool.
I'd like a bottle of your 1982
Chteau Lafite Rothschild, please.
I'm sorry.
How old are you?
Why don't we say...
A hundred?
So you are.
Wow, someone got an
advance on their allowance.
I was my grandfather's
sole heir.
I'm actually
in the Fortune 400.
Does that seem
weird to you?
I'm on a date
with Zach Young.
Nothing's ever gonna
seem weird again.
Every cent we have
is circling the bowl,
and Tom never said a word.
Why didn't he come to me?
Well, clearly,
he's embarrassed.
But I'm his wife.
Don't be dense, Lynette.
Half the reason men
want to accomplish anything
is so they can show off
for the women they love,
and when they fail, they like
to keep it to themselves.
I'm gonna tell him.
I'm gonna tell him
I went to the restaurant,
and that I know he screwed up
and that I'm gonna fix it.
Oh, for God sake, it's bad
enough you cut off his cojones.
Now you wanna
juggle them?
My husband is
in trouble.
I love him. Shouldn't
I want to help him?
Well, if you really love him,
you should help him
without letting him
know that you did.
Yeah, so in addition
to my penthouse,
I also have a chteau
in Switzerland
and a cottage
in the Hamptons.
That's pretty
impressive, huh?
You got a little chocolate
on your shirt.
Damn it!
Here, let me get it.
No, I can do it! I can do it!
I'd like to do it myself,
thank you very much.
I'm sorry, I...
You know, I'll be neater
for you ne time.
Next time?
Honey, let's get real.
You are way too young for me.
I'm two months older
than John Rowland.
Well, John Rowland
was a mistake.
I was lonely.
You're not
lonely now?
You've heard
about my divorce.
Yeah. You were really smart
to get rid of Carlos.
You deserve
much better.
And let me guess,
now you're my upgrade?
Well, everybody knows you need
someone to take care of you and,
I'm rich now. I can give
you anything you want.
Wait a minute. Who says I need
someone to take care of me?
My Mom, her friends
from the neighborhood.
They said it was the only reason
you stayed with Carlos,
considering
how he treated you.
Well, they were wrong.
Thank you for
lunch, Zach.
Wait, Gabrielle.
I'm not that awkward
kid that I was before.
Can you please just...
Please take me
seriously.
I'm sorry. I just can't.
I'm not, I'm not
gonna give up.
Oh, sweetie.
I really wish
you would.
For God sakes, Zach!
Don't hijack a Ferrari if you
don't know how to drive!
Mr. Gaunt?
Hi, I'm Lynette Scavo.
My husband is opening the
pizzeria right down the block.
If it's about that
liquor license,
I'm not signing.
Please, I've been at this
for hours. Just hear me out.
Well, I never could
resist a pretty lady.
Come on in.
Thank you.
Did you live
in Las Vegas?
I was a croupier
for 40 years,
and as you can see,
I had a weakness for showgirls.
I bet you were
quite the player.
You have no idea.
Can I top you
off there?
No, thanks.
Two's my limit.
Well, suit yourself.
Look, I understand your
concerns about the license.
Your neighbors
had them, too.
But they signed the waiver
once I explained to them
that this is
a family restaurant.
No late nights,
no loud music.
If there's one thing
I learned in Vegas,
it's that booze turns most
people into noisy jackasses,
And I don't want 'em
puking on my doorstep.
Come on, Harry.
You are my last holdout.
What's it gonna
take? Cash?
Free pizza for the rest
of your life? You name it.
Look, I hate to disappoint a
pretty lady, but I'm not signing.
Harry,
my husband quit his job
to start this restaurant,
And if we can't sell liquor,
we can't make a profit...
And whoa, whoa, whoa,
Harry. eyes up here.
Oh, sorry. I'm sorry.
Sorry.
This place is his dream,
and if he can't make it work,
then it's just gonna kill him,
And consequently,
it's gonna kill our marriage...
And, Harry, Harry,
what did I say?
I know, uh, uh,
I don't mean to be rude.
It's just that my showgirl
days were a while ago,
and I can't remember the
last time I laid eyes on a...
a beautiful woman's...
bosom.
Really?
Well, what if
I were to...
very briefly refresh
your memory?
Completely worth it.
Glad you thought so.
Come on, baby. Say it one
more time for Mommy.
So you can teach 'em
to say whatever you want?
Oh, yes. These birds
are very bright.
I think they're smarter
than people.
Some people, anyway.
Bree! Come in.
I just made some lemonade.
This isn't a social call.
We need to talk.
About what?
About what it's gonna take to get
you to sell this house and move.
Move? Why?
You're my husband's ex-wife.
You disappeared so people
would think he killed you.
Does my scomfort really need
any further explanation?
I had no idea
you felt this way.
Oh, please.
Orson made it perfectly clear
we don't want you here.
Okay, now I'm
really confused.
When Orson came by,
all he said was,
"Welcome to the street"
and did I need help unpacking.
That's not true.
You know what?
I think I've
said too much.
How about
that lemonade?
Ma'am, where would
you like this?
Ooh, uh, upstairs.
I'll show you.
Here, drink this.
You look a little pale.
Be right back.
Don't tell Bree.
Don't tell Bree.
Are you all right?
I'm so sorry.
I br... broke a glass.
Don't worry.
I'll get it.
Well, okay...
I have to go.
Bree...
Wait.
I understand why you might feel a little
threatened about my moving in here.
But in time,
you'll see I'm...
I'm perfectly harmless.
So... how was
the mystery date?
Uh, it was fabulous.
Thanks for asking.
Oh, come on.
I want details. Who is he?
He's some global financier,
Saw me on the cover
of "Paris Match. "
Good-looking,
just not my type.
Really?
'Cause I always thought that you and
Zach would make a really great couple.
You son of a bitch.
You were there?
Parked across the street,
laughing my ass off.
I can't believe
you followed me.
I thought you were meeting a psycho
killer for lunch. I was worried.
Well, at least until they brought out
the crayons and children's menus.
All right, off my porch.
Okay, but don't forget,
you asked me to
watch your back.
Yeah, about that...
I'm installing an alarm
system tomorrow, so...
I'm not gonnaeed you to
look after me anymore.
Gaby, I don't mind.
I mind.
We're divorced. I can't keep running
to you every time I get scared.
I want to be the kind of woman
who can take care of herself.
Well...
Good for you.
I'm still right
down the block,
So if you do
need me...
I won't. But thank you.
Hi.
Hey.
You're home early.
I'm celebrating. We got
our liquor license today.
Really? That's great!
Yeah, Andrew said he went all over
the neighborhood getting signatures.
Good for him.
But I think he's lying.
I think somebody else
got the siatures.
Okay, let's say just for the sake of
argument, rhat someone else did,
someone who clearly
loves you very much.
What's wrong with that?
Nothing. Nothing. Order has
been restored in the universe.
You saved the day.
I'm a loser.
Ah, come on, Tom.
I tried for two months
to get that waiver signed.
You did it in a day.
Like I said...
You can't drown
in self-pity
just because I helped you
with one tiny little thing.
Okay, but if I tell you that
the plumbing's not up code,
that we have termites and that the chairs
won't be there until after we open,
can I drown
in self-pity then?
Why haven't you told
me about all of this?
Because I wanted to accomplish
something on my own.
I'm the man. I shouldn't have
to run to my wife to bail me out.
Ow!
Gambling with our life savings
and not asking for help
doesn't make
you a man.
It makes you an idiot.
Come on, Tom, for God
sakes, we are a team,
and that restaurant
is a huge undertaking.
No one could
do it alone.
You don't ask me for help
with your ad campaigns.
Ow!
I don't have to.
You're always giving it
to me, inspiring me.
Remember the mouthwash jingle?
You came up with the hook.
And what about
the Bartlett campaign?
Would I have ever come up
with tango-dancing fleas?
All you.
There's nothing that
I have accomplished
that I could have done
without your help.
Okay, fine. I help.
We're a team.
Just don't hit
me again.
So tomorrow, first thing,
we'll fix the plumbing,
we'll call an exterminator,
we'll rent some chairs,
and we will open on time,
and it'll be a glorious success
that you will have achieved
with my help, okay?
Okay.
And tonight I'm gonna slap on some sex
perfume and you're gonna get naked,
and then we're gonna
see who the man is.
God, I hope it's me.
Oh, I'm sure it will be.
Hey, Mom. What are
you doing out here?
Okay, here's the thing-
Don't worry, I'm not gonna
get mad. Just sit down.
You know what
upset me the most?
That you didn't trust me
enough to tell me the truth.
I tried to.
You freaked out.
Well, of course
I freaked out. I'm a parent.
You know, we hope that our
children will wait to have sex till...
after we're dead.
And you wonder why
I went to Edie.
Okay, that's the other thing.
That cannot happen anymore.
You and I have always had
an amazing relationship.
Let's not mess
it up now.
Okay.
I'm sorry.
Look, I know you think
I'm too young, but...
Austin and I are in love.
Yeah, um...
About that...
God, I wish there was a pill you
could take to protect your heart.
What do you mean?
Honey, I...
I was over at
Edie's today and,
I walked in the door...
Uh, yes. I need to speak
to my husband.
Uh, yes. There he is.
Would you...
please ask him to come home
as early as possible tonight.
Thank you.
It's a dangerous world...
So we all look
for protection...
And whether we find it in
the arms of our mother...
Or at the end of
a jacket blade...
In the kiss of
our sweetheart...
Or at the end
of a barrel...
We do what we have
to, to feel safe...
Beacuse we know
somewhere in the world...
There are those who
will do us harm.
Previously on Desperate Housewives...
While Ian's wife Jane
was in a coma...
Do we have a deal?
Susan got
an ultimatum.
He's not crazy about me
spending time with my ex.
Mike's new hero...
I owe you one.
After those mutts knocked
you around the other day,
your boy paid 'em off.
Had a secret agenda.
Gabrielle.
Gabrielle learned
the identity...
I'm rich now. I can give
you anything you want.
Of her secret admirer.
Tell me everything.
And Orson's mother shared some
family secrets that Bree...
would later discover.
If there was one thing
Orson Hodge understood,
It was teeth.
That's why people stopped
him at barbecues...
During cocktail parties...
And in the occasional
men's room.
Yes, when it
came to teeth,
people expected Dr. Hodge
to have all the answers.
Sadly for Orson, this was
not always the case.
Well, it does look
a little fishy.
Fishy?
It couldn't be
more obvious.
Alma killed Monique.
That's why she disappeared.
And I bet she pulled the teeth so people
would suspect her dentist husband.
Why would she keep them?
Who knows?
She's probably gonna sneak in
and plant them in our house.
Well, we've saved for
the trouble, haven't we?
Is it a full set?
Orson!
Not on the duvet!
Oh, it's okay.
They won't stain.
I don't care! I am not sleeping in a bed
that had your dead mistress' teeth in it!
Let's just take them
to the police.
And say what?
We can't prove these
came from Alma's.
She'll deny ever
having seen them.
And don't forget,
I'm the one they suspect.
Well, we have
to do something.
I agree, but not until we
put the back in her house.
And then we'll
call the police.
Trust me, she'll never
get away with it.
Hello.
You've been very naughty,
haven't you?
Orson?
Is that you?
I know what you and Alma are
up to, and it's gonna stop.
Yes, Orson was
an expert on teeth.
I have no idea what
you're talking about.
Oh, I think you do.
That's how
he could tell
when people were
lying through them.

It can happen
so quickly.
In the moment it takes
a gunman's bullet to
enter his victim's leg...
In the time it takes
to tell a wife
her husband won't
be home for dinner...
In the instant it takes a father to
meet his son for the very first time...
Yes, life as we know it
can change...
In a heartbeat.
Jane's still
running a fever.
Yes, and she hasn't responded
to any of the meds that we've tried.
Do you think we should
call her husband?
Uh, not just yet.
Let's try vancomycin.
It worked for her before.
I don't want
Ian to worry.
This is your new
lawyer, Alan Marcus.
Alan, this is
Mike Delfino.
Hey, Mike. Sorry I couldn't
start on your case sooner.
I was wrapping up
an armed robbery trial.
It's nice to finally
meet you.
And you must be Ian.
I can't thank you enough
for helping me out here.
Susan and I are happy
to be of assistance.
So should we
get started?
Sure.
So, Mike,
I've had a chance to review
all the evidence against you,
and I've got a strategy to ensure
your case never goes to trial.
Don't you love this guy?
What's the strategy?
Pleading guilty? What
kind of a strategy is that?
He'd only be pleading
to manslaughter.
That's still ten
years in prison.
Well, which is
better than life.
And that's what Mike's
risking if he goes to trial.
With good behavior,
he could be out in five.
With a better lawyer,
he could be out in zero.
We need to find a lawyer
who believes that he's innocent.
Well, the evidence against
him is very compelling.
You're letting your feelings
for him cloud your judgment.
My "feelings for him"?
Are we gonna
do this again?
Do you realize that every
conversation we have
winds up being
about Mike?
"Who's the best lawyer for Mike?
How can we get Mike acquitted?"
I have told you I love
you a thousand times.
Where is all this
jealousy coming from?
Do you know what?
I have to catch that
plane to Montreal.
What? No, Ian,
we have to talk about this.
I can't be late.
It's business.
Look, I have provided Mike
with the best lawyer I know.
If you want to get someone else,
then you're on your own.
Whatcha doing?
Oh, deciding what to wear
on my first day back to work.
Do I look fat in this?
I think you look
good in everything.
Wow. Your father
has taught you well.
What about the
street fair?
If you're going back to work,
who's gonna take me?
Mrs. McCluskey.
Won't that be fun?
No.
Do you have to
go back to work?
Come on. You and your
brothers will be thrilled.
Don't you get tired of
me yelling at you to
clean up your room and
finish your homework?
Yeah,
But you've been a lot
nicer since you got shot.
Oh. Well, that's
good to know.
When you
think about it,
me going back to work
is not that big a deal.
We're only losing a ttle time
together in the afternoon.
But every hour counts.
I miss you
all day long.
Oh, honey...
Jeez.
Do you really mean that,
or are you manipulating Mommy
into feeling incredibly guilty?
A little bit of both.
Yep. Your father's
taught you well.
The suspense
is killing me.
Shh! Here it comes.
And now the moment
we've all been waiting for...
The winner of this year's little
miss Snowflake pageant is...
Sherri Maltby!
I'm in shock.
I mean, I knew she had a shot at
the top five, but to actually win?
I was sure she'd lose to that little blonde
bitch who sang that patriotic medley.
I know. She practically had
sparklers coming out of her ass.
Totally shameless.
Okay, hon, let's go
meet those reporters.
What are you
gonna tell 'em?
I owe it all to
Beauty by Vern.
Atta, girl.
Oh, Zach. What are
you doing here?
I came to
support you.
Oh. Okay, why don't you
support me from the lobby?
I have some networking to do.
My girl just won the pageant.
Oh, yeah, I know,
and you're welcome.
What did you do?
Don't worry. I paid the judges
in cash. There's no paper trail.
You bribed
the judges?!
Gabrielle, why are we fighting?
We should be celebrating.
I got a limo outside,
a bottle of Chilled Cristal.
Come on. Let's go.
Let's party.
Listen to me, you
pimply psychopath.
You and I are never
going to "party. "
In fact, the only reason we're ever
gonna be in the same room again
is if you strangle a cheerleader
and I wind up on the jury!
God, I love it
when we banter.
Hello, Alma.
Orson.
Uh, I let myself in.
I hope you don't mind.
Not at all.
You seem
very cheerful.
Oh, I am, 'cause
the game's over,
and you lost.
I told you what I'd do
if you pushed me away.
Well, I'm afraid that threat
no longer has any teeth in it.
Yes, your mother told me
about Bree's little discovery.
What'd you do with
Monique's teeth?
Well, maybe I threw
them away.
Maybe I hid
them here.
You might find them, if the
police don't find them first.
I don't think you'll bring
the police into this.
Well, neither
will you now.
We're done.
Why don't you do us all
a favor and go away?
You shouldn't
treat me this way.
Don't bother crying.
Tears might've worked
when we were married,
After you lost the baby.
They won't work now.
We should have
kept trying.
If we'd had a child,
we'd still be together.
I know.
That's why
I stopped trying.
Good-bye, Alma.
Well, here's
some sucky news...
Ken just quit.
Your new manager? No.
Yeah, so I'm screwed.
I'm gonna have to drop
out of the street fair.
Tom, no.
You can't. You can't.
The pizzeria opens in a
week, and that street fair
is the best advertising
we're gonna get.
I know, but I can't
work it alone.
Well, you know,
hire someone else.
Well, there's no
time for that.
The future of the
restaurant is at stake.
It is time to
get creative.
Well, I do have
one option,
But it would require
some sacrifice.
Well, whatever
it is gonna take.
You could help me.
What?! No.
Uh-Uh. Look,
I'm wearing makeup.
I am holding a briefcase.
What does this suggest to you?
You could call in sick.
I can't call in sick after
eight weeks of sick leave,
especially when I've been
fine for three of them.
Crap, that's Ed.
Lynette?
Lynette, please?
You're the one who said
that we need the street fair.
My boss is waiting for
me outside in his car.
What am I supposed to do?
It's time to get creative.
There she is.
Hey, guys.
Boy, didn't expect you
to still be wearing a sling.
Yeah...
It heals a little slower when
the bullet's still in there.
They couldn't get it out?
No, it's too close.
To what?
Everything.
God, I'm so sorry.
Hey, you got a little
cereal right...
Cereal?
I didn't have any...
Oh, I know
what that is.
I get nauseous
from the pain,
So that's just a little
residual vomit.
Lynette, you sure you're ready
to come back to work?
Yeah! Don't be silly.
I'm fine.
Come on. Let's go
sell some toothpaste.
All righty!
Let's go.
Oh, son of a bitch!
I'm sorry!
Don't touch me, okay?
Anything we can do?
My pills! My pain
pills are in my bag.
Thanks.
Oh, my pills!
I need my pills,
and now they're all dirty!
See ya next week!
Thanks for
understanding!
Hey. Looks like an interesting
book. What's it about?
Nevermind.
I'll wait for the movie.
What's eating you?
Those two guys you
saved me from?
I know you paid 'em
to attack me.
That's a lie.
You wanna take a minute
to reconsider that?
Okay. Okay.
I needed a favor, and
I wanted you to owe me.
What favor?
You sure you want
to get into this now?
Yeah.
Okay.
You remember
my son Zach?
Vaguely. Why?
Turns out you and I share
more than a cellblock.
Hello, Bree.
May I come in?
What's a garden
without a snake?
I realize I'm not
your favorite person,
But I thought you should know
why Alma's moved here.
She wants
Orson back.
Thanks for
the heads-up.
Now off you go.
Orson and I may
have our spats,
But I'm still deeply concerned
about the state of his soul.
Adultery is a sin.
I wouldn't worry
about Orson's soul.
He won't be
sleeping with Alma.
When I said
"adultery"...
I wasn't referring
to Orson and Alma.
I meant Orson and you.
Excuse me?
Our church doesn't
accept divorce.
In the eyes of God,
you're the other woman.
I'm sure you don't
see it that way,
but Alma and I do...
And Orson's
beginning to.
Are those shoes suede?
Yes. Why?
No reason.
Why the hell didn't anybody
tell me I had a son?
You'd just come
out of a coma.
They probably figured you
had enough on your plate.
Well, why are you
telling me now?
Zach and I haven't
spoken in months.
Every time I've tried to contact
him, he won't return the calls.
I don't know what
you expect me to do.
I barely remember the kid.
Yes, but he remembers you,
And I think if you reach out
to him, he'll talk to you.
Zach is all I have left
in the world.
Through everything
that's happened,
I've never stopped
loving him.
Can you please get him to
come down here and see me?
That's one hell
of a favor.
Man, you got
some nerve.
I know.
It's kind of what
got me in here.
Is it Gaby's birthday?
No, they're probably
from Zach Young.
What?
You haven't heard?
He has been begging Gaby
to go on a date with him.
He's been sending her
all sorts of stuff to bribe her,
even a diamond bracelet.
Zach Young?
Our Zach Young?
How does he
afford diamonds?
His grandfather left
him all that money.
Yeah, I thought it was in a trust,
and he couldn't touch it.
Until he turned 18,
which was a month ago.
Wow.
So Zach Young
is loaded, huh?
No. Absolutely not.
Oh, come on.
Mike needs a great lawyer.
Zach can afford a great lawyer.
I don't care. I'm not
going out with Zach young!
It's one little date.
You wouldn't even let your own
daughter go out with him.
You said he
was a psycho.
He's matured... to the
tune of a billion dollars.
Please do this... for Mike.
Susan, do you know what your
obsession with Mike has cost you?
First you piss off
Bree and then Ian,
and now you're pimping
me out to a teenager!
Okay, I deserve
the pimping remark,
but let's not pretend that,
you know, we're above teenagers.
Gaby...
You're all I've got.
Oh, fine, I'll do it.
Thank you!
This is a noble
thing you're doing.
How can you be so sure Zach's
gonna go along with this?
Oh, 'cause he's
a great kid,
and he's gonna
want to help Mike...
And you're not gonna be wearing
a bra when you ask him out.
Can you guys just
take five, please?
Gabrielle, what are
you doing here?
Wow, you have your own
recording studio in your house?
Yeah, I needed a place to lay
some tracks with my band.
You, um, you
see that guy?
He used to tour with
the Doobie Brothers.
How wild is that?
Gee, well...
Not as wild as what
I'm about to say.
You can take
me to dinner.
Seriously?
Awesome!
Yeah, here's how
it's gonna work.
We drive to the
restaurant separately,
we will not
have dessert,
and under no circumstances
will you touch me. Capisce?
Okay.
Great. In order for this
magical night to occur,
you're gonna need
to help Mike Delfino.
Mike?
What happened?
He's in jail...
for murder.
But Susan swears he's innocent, and
she wants you to get him a good lawyer.
All right,
we have a deal?
No.
No?
Oh, I would love
to help Mike.
It's just that,
if I'm paying for a lawyer,
you know, I would...
like to have more than
just one meal with you.
I'd like to have
a whole day.
A whole day?
Yeah.
Here's how
it's gonna work.
It's gonna be three
meals with dessert,
Activities of my
choosing and, uh...
A good night kiss.
Now do we...
Do we have a deal?
Not quite.
The day starts with lunch,
and that kiss, off the table.
Did they set
bail for Mike?
You know, 'cause
I could throw that in, too.
One million dollars.
It's no biggie.
One call to my accountant,
and Mike's a free man.
Or do you want
to tell Susan that
Mike's gonna stay in jail
because you wouldn't kiss me?
Okay, deal,
you little skunk.
Here you go. You can
come back for seconds.
Our famous
pepperoni pizza.
Here's another canadian bacon.
There you go.
Great. Guess what?
Our line is the biggest
one at the fair.
I counted.
You know what
I'm starting to think?
What?
This restaurant is
gonna be a big, fat hit.
Here you go.
Can I talk to you
about something?
I think you hurt
Lynette's feelings
when you refused to go
to the street fair with her.
She's gonna start to
think you don't like her.
You don't want
that, do you?
Doorbell.
Some of 'em should be
left on a hillside to rot.
Hi.
Hi.
I'm Ed Ferrara, Lynette's boss.
Is she around?
Uh, well, actually, she's at
the, uh, the, uh, doctor's.
Oh. Yeah. Well,
could you give her this?
Sure.
And tell her
to get well.
And she doesn't need
to come back to work
till she's goo
and ready.
I will make sure
she gets this.
Okay.
Excuse me. Mister?
I just wanted to tell you our
babysitter gets mixed up sometimes.
Lynette's not
at the doctor's.
She's not?
Nope.
Well... where is she?
Excuse me.
Hey.
Try some of that. Hey.
Load me up again,
would ya?
Yeah?
I'm gonna go poach some customers
from that sausage-on-a-stick guy.
Oh, I love it.
Scavo's pizzeria!
Try the smoked chicken
and sundried tomato. Mmm!
This crust is fantastic!
It's cornmeal.
That's the secret.
It's not your only secret,
is it, Lynette?
Hi... Ed.
How's the arm?
Uh, on the mend,
but I'm gonna be there bright
and early Monday morning.
Don't bother.
You're fired.
Wait, Ed!
Ed, please don't go.
Yes, I lied, and that was wrong,
but my husband needed my help.
I need your help. You've been
gone eight weeks, with pay,
while the company's
been falling apart.
And now you
pull this on me?
Like I said,
really, really wrong,
but if you take me back,
I swear I will give you 100%.
So... if we have to work
late, you're gonna do it.
If I ask you to miss
your kid's baseball game,
you're gonna say,
"No problem, Ed"?
You got it, Ed.
Good. I'll see you Monday.
Hi. It's me.
Um, listen,
we have to talk.
Ian, I'm sorry, too. We've got
to stop fighting like this.
Susan, um, Jane's
doctor called me.
She's taken
a bad turn.
Oh. Ian...
I'm, uh, I'm on
the next flight out,
but it's not for aew hours,
and Jane's parents are in Rome.
Would, uh, would you go
to the hospital for me?
The hospital?
Well, I know it's a lot to ask,
but if something should happen, I...
Well, I don't want
her to be alone.
Oh, I'm stuffed.
I can't believe you talked me
into that crme brle.
Oh, don't feel guilty.
I'm sure we burned it
off on the dance floor.
I know! You're such
a good dancer!
Where'd you learn
how to salsa?
I've been taking lessons 'cause
I knew it was your favorite.
When did I say that?
"Cosmo," '98.
And I knew you liked that Merlot
from your "Vogue" interview.
You researched me?
That's sweet!
In a, uh, stalkery
kind of way.
Thanks again for a surprisingly
enjoyable night.
See you around.
Uh... Gaby?
Right, the kiss.
Sorry. I didn't mean
to welsh on ya.
All right.
Pucker up.
What the hell
are you doing?!
But you said I
could kiss you.
Yes, my lips,
not my esophagus!
For your information, I have been told
that I'm a very good kisser, all right?
By who?
The same girl that taught you to use
your tongue like a windshield wiper?
No, by women, women
with lots of experience,
and every single one of them
said that I was a great kisser.
How much did you
pay them to say that?
No!
You've paid women for...
It's none of your business, all right?
It's none of your business.
Uh, yes, it is.
You just vacuumed my tonsils. I deserve
to know where that mouth has been.
You know what?
I'm sorry. I gotta go.
Wait, Zach.
Zach, I'm not mad!
Okay, I'm just a little...
grossed out, that's all!
No, you heard me.
You heard me, all right?
Read my lips.
Just go, all right?
Go! You've got no
right to be here!
All right!
What, another one?
You organ donor
people are vultures.
Um, no, actually,
I'm a friend of Ian's.
He asked me to
come... for Jane.
Oh, you...
you're the girlfriend.
All right, that's okay then.
Come on in.
So, Erika, you were fighting
with that guy when I came in.
Have you had a lot of those
organ donor people around today?
Oh, that wasn't
about that.
No, that was Ted.
What, Ian never told you
about Jane and Ted?
No. What about them?
Nothing. Forget I mentioned it.
It is not my place.
What?
They had an affair.
Jane cheated on Ian?
When was this?
I hate to dish my best
friend on her death bed...
But gossip was the foundation
of our relationship, so...
It was five
years ago.
Ian was traveling a lot
on business,
Jane was lonely,
and along came Ted.
I'm just stunned.
So I guess they
worked it out, right?
Well, Ian took
her back.
But if you're asking, did he
ever really trust her again?
I don't think so.
Poor Ian.
You don't know
the half of it.
I mean, to be betrayed by
somebody you loved that much...
You're just
never the same.
Hey. What are
you doing here?
Um, word on the street is
you're looking for a manager.
Yeah.
Here's my application.
I thought Ed
took you back.
He did. I told him
I wasn't interested.
What?
You're quitting?
I had so much fun
at the fair today,
working with you on
something that was all ours.
I want every day
to be like that.
Honey, so do I.
Are you sure?
I mean, your career's
always meant so much to you.
When I got shot and I was lying
there bleeding, I wasn't thinking,
"God, I'm really gonna
miss advertising. "
I think this could be the best thing
that's ever happened to our family.
We can make our own hours,
we'll be together more,
and, yes, the money
is gna be a little tight,
but I think this place
could be a gold mine.
In that case,
you're hired.
You do, of course, realize you
have to sleep with the boss.
I can do that.
Good.
Wow.
It's a little soon to be
gunning for a promotion.
Your mother
not home yet?
Uh, I haven't
seen her.
Hello?
What is it now?
Alma did what?!
No, no.
I'll be right over.
Wait, wait, what...
What did Alma do?
I just thank the Lord
I got here when I did.
But why didn't you
call an ambulance?
I thought it best for all
concerned to keep this quiet.
By the way,
she left a note.
She only did this
to upset me.
She knows
my history.
She knows exactly
what buttons to push.
Orson, calm down.
Here.
Our marriage is over.
I will not submit
to emotional blackmail.
Are you all right?
I feel dizzy.
Then perhaps
you should just...
Sit.
My God.
Did you poison me?
And kill my only child?
You see how
he talks to me?
It's my fault.
I upset him.
Sorry about all this.
I just needed to
get your attention.
Why?
What do you want?
What every mother
wants, dear...
A grandchild.
Wewell, why don't I give
you two some privacy?
Thank you,
mother Hodge.
You mustn't struggle.
I want this baby
to be born of love.
I've been
injecting myself...
with hormones...
to improve our chances.
You wait and see.
This is gonna fix everything.
You're crazy.
Crazy for you, mister!
I won't. You
can't make me.
Yes, I can.
That drink had two
kinds of pills in it.
One to put you to sleep,
and one to keep the part of
you I need nice and perky.
Now... how about
a little music?
*We're all alone, no chaperone
can get our number... *
*The world's in slumber,
let's misbehave... *
The doctor was just here. He said
her blood pressure's dropping.
She could go anytime.
I gotta go call
her parents.
Hi.
It's me.
We just took off.
I'll be there in
about six hours.
Uh, sweetie...
I don't think she's
gonna make it that long.
Don't tell me that.
You've done everything you could.
She knows that you love her.
Well, it's just there's... There's
things I've got to say to her.
I've carried around so much anger about
something that doesn't mean anything now,
And I... I need
her to know that.
I'm gonna put the phone
up to Jane's ear,
And you can tell her
whatever you need to, okay?
Okay.
Hello, Jane,
darling. It's Ian.
I never imagined I'd have to
say goodbye to you like this.
There's so much
I want to say...
You play that
pretty well.
What are you
doing here?
I had a good
time tonight,
But... I hated
the way it ended.
Yeah, me, too.
Gaby...
About those women...
Forget about it.
Give a horny kid
a couple million bucks
and the yellow pages,
and stuff is gonna happen.
It's not just them. I...
I'm paying everyone
that I know.
Those guys in my band,
they're not my friends.
I'm hiring them
to hang out with me.
So stop doing it.
Stop buying people.
Yeah, right, and then
I'd have no one at all.
That's not true.
You'd have me.
As a friend.
A friend friend.
Not a girlfriend.
I really cannot
overstress that.
Come on.
Why do you wanna
be my friend?
We have zero
in common.
I don't know.
Maybe it's because
I think we're both... adrift.
It'd just be nice to have a pal
who gets what I'm going through.
Why don't you play me
something you wrote?
Yeah?
Okay. Can I sing, too?
Sure. Why not?
All right.
Gaby,
sweet Gaby...
Wow. Why don't you
just hum it, okay?
Hi.
Sorry. My book
club ran late.
Didn't Orson
make you dinner?
Oh, no.
He's been
over at Alma's.
He's been there
for a few hours now.
What the hell is this?!
Oh, Bree. I'soso sorry
you had to find out this way.
Not as sorry as you
are gonna be!
Orson, get up!
Leave him alone.
He wants to be with me now.
Orson, I have caught you cheating.
At least have the courtesy to wake up!
Oh, for God sakes.
Orson!
Orson?
What have you
done to him?!
Nothing. You know men.
The minute it's over...
Wham, off to dreamland.
He's not sleeping.
He's out cold.
Oh, I knew it.
These are sleeping pills,
and these are...
Oh, my God.
You raped my husband!
We made love,
And when our baby's born,
he's gonna come back to me.
Baby?!
It's true. I could be
expecting right now.
Were you expecting this?
Andrew, I need you to come
over here right away...
And, um...
Bring the wheelbarrow.
Hi.
Do... do you
remember me?
No.
No, not really.
But I know
who you are.
Okay. Good.
What you did,
I'm, um...
really grateful.
It's cool.
So if you need anything else,
I guess...
Just let me know.
Well, I do need something.
But it's not for me.
So how you doing?
You look terrific,
really mature.
Your mother
would be proud.
Thanks.
I've, uh, really
missed you a lot,
And I'm sorry for, uh...
for everything.
I hope you can forgive me.
I want us to be friends.
And that's the only reason
you wanted to see me, right?
So we could be friends?
Yes.
Okay.
That's great.
That's fine.
Well, there is
one other thing.
Oh. Yeah.
It's just... Felicia Tillman
faked her death.
She's still out there.
You and I, we both know that.
If you gave, or lent
me some money,
I could hire someone
to track her down,
And then I could
get out of here,
and you and I could
pick up where we left off.
Okay...
You asked me
how I was doing.
I'm actually
doing great.
I've got the hottest, most amazing
girlfriend in the entire world,
and I am gonna
marry that woman.
I'm gonna buy her
everything she wants.
So...
I have got to learn to say no
when people ask me for money,
Because I got a future
wife to think about.
She's got really
expenveve taste.
I mean, I do forgive
you, though...
Paul.
Hey, Susan.
Hey. You're back.
Yeah, Zach Young
posted my bail,
But I'm guessing you had
something to do with it.
Maybe a little.
Is there any way
that I can thank you,
You know, for everything
you've done?
Actually,
yeah, there is.
Good. Good.
Just tell me.
I can't see
you anymore.
I want you to understand it doesn't
have anything to do with you.
It's just...
That's okay.
It's not...
I think I get it.
Well, I, uh,
I should probably go.
Bye.
Good luck
with everything.
Good luck to
you and Ian.
Yes, it can
happen so quickly.
Life as we know it can change
in the blink of an eye.
Unlikely friendships
can blossom...
Important careers
can be tossed aside...
A long-lost hope
can be rekindled.
Still, we should be grateful for
whatever changes life throws at us,
because all too soon
the day will come...
when there are
no changes left.
Previously on Desperate Housewives...
Ian's wife Jane
passed away.
Gaby made a new friend.
A "friend" friend,
not a girlfriend.
The finger of guilt...
I think it's a
phone number.
Pointed toward Mike...
They tested my wrench and found
traces of this Monique's blood.
But he still couldn't
remember.
Bree found a bag
of evidence.
We have to
do something.
Not until we put these
back in her house.
Orson had a night...
What do you want?
A grandchild.
That he'd soon
rather forget.
You raped my husband.
I could be expecting
right now.
It had been two months
since Mike Delfino
had awakened
from his coma,
and the memories
he had lost
were finally
starting to return.
He could now recall the first
time he saw Wisteria Lane...
And the first time he met
his new neighbors...
And the first time he heard
Susan Mayer laugh.
But the memory he most wanted
to reclaim still eluded him.
That's why he had gone
to see a hypnotherapist,
so that he could finally
remember everything.
I thought you'd
never get here.
I'm sorry.
The traffic was terrible.
Sorry about that.
I called my landlord when
the pipe started leaking,
and he recommended you.
I was so flustered, I couldn't
find a piece of paper.
I wrote your number
on my hand.
After you finish the sink, maybe
you could help me wash it off.
Look...
I'm flattered,
but I'm seeing somebody.
Me, too.
But he's married,
and I'm drunk.
Well, your s-trap
is cracked.
I don't have
one with me.
I'll have to go to
a hardware store.
Now? It's late.
Yeah, well, that water's
just gonna keep seeping,
cause a lot
more damage.
I'll, uh, be back
in an hour.
I'll be waiting.
Ms. Polier?
I've, uh... got that
part for the sink.
Hello?
What happened, Mike?
I almost had it.
I was so close.
Close to what?
When I went back
to Monique's place,
somebody else
was there.
Who?
I don't know.
I couldn't see it.
Yes, there were
still many things
Mike Delfino
couldn't remember...
Then why are
you smiling?
But he'd finally remembered
the most important thing of all.
'Cause now I know
I didn't kill her.

It was 6:00 in
the morning,
and Bree Hodge was
faced with a dilemma
familiar to countless
housewives.
Should she wake her husband
to discuss recent events
that were weighing
heavily on her mind?
Or should she left him continue
to get the rest he needed?
Bree made the
obvious choice.
I'm sorry, but you've been
out cold for ten hours,
and we need to talk.
I remember
drinking the scotch
and then Alma
suddenly sitting up.
But after that, nothing.
Oh, dear.
I'm not sure how
to tell you this, but...
After Alma knocked you out,
she assaulted you.
Where?
Sexually.
She had sex with you.
But that's impossible.
Your drink was laced
with pills for...
erectile dysfunction.
But I was dead
to the world.
No, dear, you were
dead to the waist.
I had sex with Alma,
and I wasn't even conscious?
How reminiscent
of our marriage.
Okay, this is no joke.
She raped you,
and your mother helped.
Look, after we get dressed,
we're going to the police.
I can't do that.
Orson,
I know you're
embarrassed,
but what they did to
you was a crime.
No, I can't go
to the police.
Not now, not ever.
Orson, your ex-wife
is a homicidal rapist,
and your mother is
straight out of "I, Claudius. "
Why do you refuse
to deal with them?
I think it's time I told you about
the night Monique Polier died.
What do you think
of this one?
Pretty sexy.
Is sexy what you're going for at
the funeral of your boyfriend's wife?
You're right.
I'll keep looking.
Why are you even going?
Won't it be weird?
No, it'll be fine.
Ian wants me there.
Yeah, but it'll be all
of Jane's friends and family,
and you'll be the other woman
who swooped in like some...
Okay, yes,
it'll be weird.
But it's not about me.
This is about
Jane and Ian.
What if I wore
this one?
Then it'll be about Jane,
Ian and your boobs.
I have got to get more
depressing clothes.
Okay, I just need to keep a low
profile through the memorial,
'cause once I get
through this,
Ian can officially introduce
me as his girlfriend,
and we'll finally be a normal,
non-adulterous couple.
What does this one
say to you?
Modest, reserved and definitely not
dating the dead lady's husband.
Sold.
I'm not gonna get you
towels for your birthday.
Let's go to the
jewelry department.
No, Zach, I only accept jewelry
from men I plan on sleeping with.
Well, okay, so where
does that leave me?
You can buy me
that toilet seat cover.
Fine. All right,
we're just friends.
Can I at least take you out
for a birthday dinner?
There will be
no celebration.
I'm turning 31.
I'm a single woman
in her 30s.
I now have to subscribe
to "Cat Fancy. "
It's the law.
Age is just a number.
It doesn't mean anything.
It means something to me.
Being alone at
this age, it's hard,
and it's only
gonna get harder.
I'm so depressed.
Let me buy
you a car.
No, thanks.
But I do need a, uh,
liquid soap dispenser.
Go.
Hello.
Oh, sorry.
Didn't mean to disturb you.
I was just trying to
see whether or not
this was a regular king
or a California king.
Well, I think
it's a regular.
California kings
are much longer.
Is your... wife
particularly tall?
Oh, I'm, uh,
I'm not married.
Oh. Well, why
don't you try it out?
That's okay. I can
wait till you get off.
Oh, that'll happen a lot faster
if you just hop on board.
I'm sorry?
It was a...
shameless sex joke.
I was flirting with you.
Right!
Sorry, I can be
a little dense.
Can we start over?
No. Moment's gone.
You killed it.
Uh, look, you know,
I'm in a bit of a hurry,
but maybe we can try
this again sometime.
It could happen.
Hey, sorry
I took so long.
Mr. Young?
Oh. You know
my friend Zach?
No, I don't think so.
I'm Luke... Purdue?
I'm on your legal team. I'm taking
point on the Halverson deal.
Yeah, right. Hey.
Again, it was
nice meeting you.
Sir.
That was really weird.
I don't even know the guy,
and he works for me.
Works for me, too.
Bree...
Please don't touch me.
All this time, you've said
you wanted the truth.
That's before
I knew what it was.
You see, that's why I've tried
to protect you from this.
Yeah, but you weren't just
trying to protect me, were you?
What do you
want me to do?
Exonerate Mike.
How could you
stand by and let an
innocent man be
dragged off to prison?
You think I haven't
felt terrible?
And this, after he'd
been in a coma
because some lunatic
ran him over.
He has had
a rough year.
I wanna help Mike.
How do I do that without
implicating myself?
I could go to jail.
I don't care
if you go to jail.
You have done a horrible thing,
and you have to make it right.
I mean it, Orson.
If you don't fix this,
I will.
Well, I guess I'm in
no position to argue.
No, you're not.
Morning, Andrew.
Hey, Orson.
I was just gonna ask if you
guys wanted some coffee.
Yeah. Thanks.
I could use some.
It's gonna be
a long day.
Thank you.
Thanks.
Thank you.
Mom!
Dinner is in an hour.
You know the rules.
And so do you.
I know, I know,
but he gave me the face.
You fell for the face.
What are you, a rookie?
Okay, you're right.
Sorry, buddy.
Mom's the boss.
I feel nothing.
Hi, Lynette.
Hey, Tom.
How's the restaurant going?
You ready for
the big opening?
Oh, we're getting there.
Let me give you a coupon.
Free extra topping
on any medium or large.
How nice.
But you know what
would be even nicer?
Hire my nephew
to work for you.
You know, the coupon's
good all week.
Look, I don't know what lies
you've heard about Austin,
but you can't be listening
to vicious gossip.
I heard he got arrested
for beating some guy up.
Okay, that one's
pretty accurate.
Edie, I'm all staffed up.
Come on!
Help me out.
Seriously, ever since
Julie dumped him,
he's been depressed and mopey.
He's driving me crazy.
Please, any crappy
job you got.
Well, I guess I could use
an extra guy in back.
Have him there tomorrow,
8:00 in the morning.
Thank you.
Thank you so, so much.
Uh, Edie, you forgot
your coupon.
Tom, please.
You've checked out my butt enough
times to know that I don't eat pizza.
Zach!
I know. You said you wanted to be
alone for your birthday, but, uh,
that's just dumb, so
I'm gonna take you out.
Oh, that's so sweet,
but I, uh...
Don't worry.
It's just gonna be one friend
keeping another friend company.
It's not gonna be a date.
Oh, well, um,
Luke's gonna be here in 20 minutes,
and that kind of will be a date.
Luke?
That's, uh...
my lawyer guy?
Yeah.
That isn't a
problem, is it?
'Cause this is what friends do.
They talk about each other's dates.
No, I'm cool.
Have a great time.
Uh, I'm gonna
get out of your hair.
So you think this
guy's really into you?
Well, he seemed to like me
in the mattress department,
so here's hoping I like him
the mattress department.
What?
Friends say these things.
Orson.
Oh, well, I'm in luck.
The whole coven's here.
I just stopped by
to say thank you.
Mm... you're welcome.
I bought a pregnancy test,
but it's too soon to take it.
I wasn't talking
about the sex.
Though hats off, mother,
for colluding in my rape.
I think it's great that we can
still surprise each other.
No, I was talking more about
what you did for me and Bree.
What did I do?
Your little stunt
made her so angry,
she demanded
we go the police.
She forced my hand,
So I told her
everything.
Everything?
That is rather unwise.
I faced my worst fear,
the moment I felt sure would end
my marriage, and guess what?
It didn't.
She forgave you?
Not entirely.
Not yet.
But she'll come around.
The good news is,
the months of dread,
the fear of discovery...
that's all over.
So thank you...
and good-bye.
Wait!
I could be carrying
your child!
I don't care if you've got
the Hodge septuplets in there.
I'm sticking with Bree.
Why must he make
everything so difficult?
Oh, uh, floor's done.
I told you I wanted this floor
to sparkle like your Mom's.
Now does this floor look
"Bree Hodge" clean to you?
Uh... no. It looks "Andrew
Van De Kamp" clean.
But your disappointment
in me is very Bree Hodge.
Okay, just for that, you get
to help me take out the trash.
I know you think
I'm being a hard-ass,
But I'm just looking for a basic
level of professionalism that...
Austin?
What the hell's
going on here?
Just, uh, just talking
to the delivery guy.
Hey, where'd he go?
Are you high?
Only...
Totally.
Austin!
Dude, not smart.
But I have good reason,
and when you hear it,
you're not gonna make
that face anymore.
Julie Mayer dumped me,
and I'm very...
very upset.
Your face is
not changing.
Get your stuff.
Get the hell out of my restaurant.
You're fired. Go on.
Floor's looking pretty
clean right now, isn't it?
You said he'd come
back to me.
You said deep down,
he still loves me.
Well, you heard him
today. He hates me!
You ravished him
against his will.
He's bound to be touchy
in the short run.
I'll handle Orson.
You just worry about the baby.
He said he
doesn't care.
He says that now,
But he will not abandon
his own flesh and blood.
You're his flesh
and blood.
He put you in a home.
You know, I usually don't
say this to expectant mothers,
but for God sake,
have a scotch.
I should just
call the police.
What?
I know what he did.
If he's never gonna love me,
why should I protect him?
I'd rather see him in jail
than playing house
with tammy tightass.
Knock it off, Alma.
I will make Orson
come around.
I don't believe
you anymore.
She's got her claws in him,
and she's not letting go.
Don't be so sure.
I was looking over
at their house last night,
and I saw
something very...
curious.
What?
You can't see
it down here.
We need to
be up higher.
How can you see anything from here?
There's not even a window.
Gloria?
Gloria?!
Just calm down,
sweetheart.
Gloria, let me out!
Stress isn't good
for the baby.
What are you doing?!
Gloria?!
So how are you
holding up?
Better, now that
you're here.
Oh! No, I wanna, um,
keep a low profile.
But I've kissed
a hundred lips today.
I assure you, it would look
more conspicuous if I didn't.
Okay, that's enough.
Ian, oh,
you must be shattered.
I know I am.
Thanks for coming, Lynn.
You know, Jane used
to kid me about you.
Huh. Did she?
She'd say, "Lynn, if anything
ever happens to me,
I want you to marry Ian. "
"You're pushy.
Maybe you can get him
to pick up his socks. "
Listen, um, if you
ever need to talk,
I'm here.
Why don't you stop over some
night for a home-cooked meal?
Oh, that... that's
very kind of you,
but I wouldn't dream
of putting you out.
Well, I won't take
"no" for an answer.
Have you got
my number?
I sure as hell do.
Well, I'm sure I'll find it
in Jane's phone book.
Let me give it to you,
just in case.
Call anytime.
Oops. Watch yourself.
So I was there
on a plumbing job.
It makes complete sense.
I had no reason
to want her dead.
I always thought hypnotherapy
was a bunch of bull, but damn.
This is huge, man.
You didn't kill anyone.
The murderer has to be
this yellow gloves guy.
Yeah, but no matter
how much I concentrate,
I still can't see a face.
Ah, you will.
Look at the progress
that you've made so far.
You're gonna
find this guy,
and then you're gonna
hand his ass over to the cops.
Yeah...
something like that.
Hey, guys.
Well, Ian seems
to be holding up.
It's just a mask.
The man is devastated.
Tomorrow night, I'm gonna swing by
his place to offer him a casserole
and a shoulder to cry on.
Will that shoulder be
wearing a spaghetti strap,
and Chanel no. 5?
You know me so well.
Oh, look at him.
Even in mourning,
the man is scrumptious.
I'm sorry for eavesdropping,
but don't you think your conversation
is a little inappropriate?
I mean, we're here
to grieve, not cruise.
I'm sorry,
and you are...
Susan Mayer.
I'm... a friend
of the family.
Then you know how
lonely Ian's been.
And if I want to do
something about that,
it's no business of yours.
Look, just to save you
the embarrassment,
Ian's seeing someone.
Who?
I'm not at liberty to say.
Under the circumstances,
they'd prefer to keep it quiet.
I don't believe it. If there was
some bimbo in the picture,
I'd have heard about it.
As far as I'm concerned,
he's free meat.
Okay, it's me.
What?
I'm the bimbo.
He's my meat.
All righty.
I just wanted
to clear that up.
And now I'm going to go
find myself a seat with a...
better view.
Here are your W-4s.
Please sign them and get them
back to me as soon as possible.
Also, I'm gonna need a copy,
hi, of your driver's license.
Austin?
Yeah?
What are you doing
here? I fired you.
Well, Mr. Scavo gave
me my job back.
Hey!
You hired him back?
Did he tell you he
was stoned on the job?
Yeah, and he knows if he
does again, he's outta here.
So I wanted...
Look, I don't know what kind
of hustle you pulled on him,
but it's not gonna work on me.
Lynette.
No, I fired him, and you
are gonna stay fired.
Honey, can I see you
in the back for a sec?
What the hell
are you doing,
Talking to me like that
in front of my staff?
Well, I'm sorry, but you totally
blindsided me out there.
No, I was the one
who was blindsided.
You just went off on me without
hearing what my reasons were.
Well, I'm sorry.
Let's hear them.
What are your reasons for
bringing back Joe Bong hit?
I'll tell ya,
if you drop that tone and
stop making that face.
What is...
This was
a business decision.
In case you
hadn't noticed,
and I hadn't, until the waitresses
pointed it out to me, Austin is hot.
He's gonna bring in every
girl from Fairview high
And half the boys
in the chorus.
What's more,
Edie is gonna include our menu in the
welcome packet she gives to new homeowners.
I'm not sure she'd feel so
generous If we fired her nephew.
Those reasons
working for ya?
Yeah.
I just wish you'd told me
before you rehired him.
I mean, I am the manager.
Right...
But I'm the boss.
Well, kinda.
No, no.
Not "kind of. "
Really.
I'm the boss.
You pulling rank on me?
Look, at home,
you get to be in charge,
and you decide how
we discipline the boys,
what car we buy,
everything.
I consult you.
Oh, sure, and if you
disagree, you ignore me.
Look, when I go home,
basically, I check
my balls at the door,
and that's fine.
It works.
But for this to work, when
you walk through that door,
you gotta check yours.
Okay.
Really?
Really.
This place
is your dream, so...
Consider them checked.
Thanks. Now I need you
to do just one more thing.
Whatever you say...
boss.
I don't care if you think
you know what's best!
You don't! I do,
because I'm the boss,
and what I say goes.
Yeah, that's it.
Give it to me.
So when I make a decision,
it stays made!
You got that, Lynette?
Yes, sir.
Okay, that's enough.
No, just one more.
And if I want your opinion,
I'll ask for it!
But I probably won't,
because I'm the boss!
Are we clear?
Seriously, stop
or I will hurt you.
Okay, I've made my point.
Anybody needs me,
I'll be in the back...
drinking a beer.
This is delicious.
Don't get too full.
You have to leave
room for dessert.
What are we having?
Well, let's just say it's
going to be served upstairs
and involves
whipped cream.
Is it pudding?
No.
Oh! You're flirting.
Okay. Do it again.
I swear I'll get it.
It's okay. Do you
want some coffee?
You bet I want coffee...
nice and hot and...
Just finish your soup,
and we'll get naked.
Sorry to bother you,
Mrs. Solis.
I work with Luke.
Is he available?
Charles?
What are you
doing here?
You forgot to initial some pages
on the Halverson contract.
Can't this wait?
The market's already
open in Tokyo.
Uh, go ahead. I'm gonna
open some more wine.
Mr. Young wants to make sure
you understand that last part.
Do you?
Yeah.
I get it.
So when we
think of Jane,
Let us remember her kind
heart and her loving spirit.
And now if there's someone who'd like to
share a special memory of our dear friend?
I would.
Hi. I'm Lynn Dean.
Jane and I were
sorority sisters.
If she were here, she'd make
me sing our pledge song,
but I think there's already been
enough grief for one day.
Now I know how badly
we've all felt for Ian
during his long,
lonely vigil,
So I'm sure you'll be as
happy as I was to learn
His vigil wasn't quite
so lonely after all.
Oh, dear God.
No, he found a warm,
caring woman
to share his burden...
and so much else.
Some people might find
the fact that she's here today...
inappropriate.
But I think she's a hero.
She dared to brave the scorn of
those who might find her actions
questionable or
even unsavory.
I was gonna ask her to stand,
but I see she already has.
Susan Mayer,
say hello.
Hey.
Guess someone's in a hurry
to get on with the evening.
Yeah.
Well, I should go.
What?
I have a lot more work to do
on that Halverson deal.
Sorry.
But can't it wait
till after dessert?
And by "dessert,"
I mean sex.
You are clear
on that, right?
Painfully,
but my job's at stake here.
I really don't have much of a choice.
Oh, I think you've got
lots of choices.
Here's one of them.
Hello?
What do you think
you're doing?
What?
I gave you an order,
and I expect you to follow it.
Now get out of there.
I'm trying, sir.
It's just that I'm meeting
some resistance to the plan...
we've agreed on.
Okay, she's not letting
you leave? That's fine.
Here's what
I want you to say.
Okay, I'll give
that a shot, sir.
Is that your office?
Yeah, they, uh, they really
need me over there.
Okay. So come back when
you're done. I'll wait up.
I can't.
No, I really can't.
What is with you?!
An hour ago,
you were really into me,
and now you can't
get out fast enough.
Okay. Truth?
I thought I could
do this, but I can't.
I'm just not
attracted to you.
Of course you are!
No. See...
I really only date
women in their 20s.
What?
Sorry.
You're too
old for me.
I still got a lot of kick
for an old broad, don't I?!
Mom?
Mom?
Mom, are you all right?
Don't move her. She might
have broken something.
Yes, we need an ambulance,
please, at 4354 Wisteria Lane.
My wife's had a bad fall.
Please hurry.
How is this?
Mrs. Hodge was very lucky.
She only suffered
a slight concussion.
If you have any more questions,
the doctor should be back soon.
Thank you.
Thank God.
I was so worried.
Yeah, I'll bet.
What's that
supposed to mean?
I heard you two
yesterday-
All that stuff about you
maybe going to jail.
Well, that's none
of your business.
But if you think I had anything
to do with Bree falling...
I'm not stupid.
I know the cops have been all
over you about that dead woman,
and Mom said for you
to fix it, or she would.
Is this "accident"
how you fixed it?
All right, you're
upset. I get it.
No, no, you don't get it.
There's a reason my Mom put
me out on the street last year.
You've never met that guy.
You've never met bad Andrew.
But hurt my Mom,
and you will.
I love your mother.
I'm gonna do everything
I can to protect her.
Yeah, so am I.
Hi. I'm Bree Hodge's son.
You see that guy
right there?
That's her husband.
Do not under any circumstances
let him be alone with her.
Why?
Because it's his fault
that she's in here.
He's a dangerous guy.
Now I've warned you.
If anything happens
to her, you're liable.
Night, Dad.
Oh, you're home.
I thought you'd still be
out on your date.
Date's over.
What do you want?
Oh, I thought since I can't
take you out for your birthday,
I'd at least leave
you a present.
Don't worry.
It's not expensive.
Ah, Zach!
So how'd your date go?
Is he crazy?
You're not old.
You did not see the look on his
face when I tried to kiss him.
It's like he was
sniffing expired milk.
That's ridiculous.
You're gorgeous,
And you're just gonna
get prettier every year.
Ah, that's so sweet...
But it's a lie.
Every tick of the clock
takes away something.
Zach, what am I gonna do
when I'm not pretty anymore?
That's never
gonna happen.
I'm gonna take
a little nap, okay?
Just for a minute.
Take as long
as you like.
Susan, I've looked
everywhere for you.
I didn't think
to start with the, um...
embalming room.
Yeah. I'll be having
night terrors from now on...
which I deserve.
Look, no one
is judging you.
If anything, they're judging
that dreadful Lynn.
I should be thanking you
for driving her away.
It usually takes a crucifix
and some garlic.
I'm so sorry
I ruined Jane's funeral.
No, you didn't.
Yes, I did.
It's just...
What?
I thought after we got
through this really...
painful day,
things would start
to get better.
I thought I could be
more a part of your world.
Now all your friends and family
are just gonna think of me
as the crazy lady
from Jane's funeral.
Oh, God. Oh, Ian.
Okay, this is not
supposed to be about me.
You should be upstairs...
saying good-bye.
I'm just gonna
hide out here
with the departed
until everybody leaves.
No.
No more hiding.
We have been doing
it far too long.
You have nothing
to be ashamed of.
You helped me through the
most difficult part of my life.
I love you, and I want to spend
the rest of my life with you.
I want to marry you.
Ian, are you
proposing to me?
Well...
I guess maybe I... I am.
Before you say
another word...
Take a look around.
Ah. Right.
I hadn't really thought a lot
about this moment,
but when I did...
the table we were at
didn't have a blood gutter.
Then may I reopen the subject at
a more opportune time and place?
Yes.
I accept your
proposal to propose.
Shall we?
Now I want you
to dig deep.
If you feel your
memory blocked,
just count to three,
and the block will melt away.
It is natural and easy
for you to recall anything.
Now remember
Monique Polier.
Remember the night
you met her.
Ms. Polier?
I've, uh... got that
part for the sink.
Hello?
Sorry.
Monique's upstairs
taking a nap.
She wasn't feeling well.
Mike? Did you
see something?
I'm her boyfriend.
I, uh, figured she'd want to
wake up to a clean kitchen.
Well, I'll just finish up with the
sink and be out of your hair.
Why don't you let me
take care of the sink?
I mean, I'm pretty handy,
and it's getting late.
I don't mind staying.
No, look, it's okay.
I got it under control.
Here.
Well, this should cover
what we owe you.
Tell Ms. Polier
I hope she feels better.
Will do.
Oh, hey...
Don't forget
your wrench.
Mike? Where
are you going?
Mike!
Hey, Mr. Delfino.
I need to talk
to your stepdad.
Orson's not here. He went
to the hospital with my Mom.
She's fine!
Thanks for asking!
Mr. Hodge?
You're wife's just sleeping.
I suggest you go home
and do the same.
I will.
You're okay?
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.
It's just, uh...
There was a time where
we were all so happy.
I just don't seem to
remember it anymore.
Recapturing the past
is a tricky business.
While most memories are just
memories of a happier time...
Hey, there.
Others can be
quite deadly.
Hey, Mike.
What brings you
to the hospital?
I've been seeing
an hypnotherapist.
She's helping me fill the
gaps of my memory.
How is it going?
It's working.
Previously on Desperate Housewives...
The Scavos prepared
for a grand opening...
This could be the best thing
that's ever happened to our family.
While Gabrielle had
a few too many drinks...
I'm gonna take
a little nap, okay?
And a cry for help made
Orson lose his cool.
Suicide is the worst thing
that could happen to a family!
Mike got arrested...
Oh, thank God.
And a friendship
hit the rocks.
For the sake of our friendship...
Make no mistake,
our friendship is over.
Orson's Mom
was determined...
In the eyes of God,
you're the other woman.
To bring Alma and
Orson back together.
She raped you, and
your mother helped.
I think it's time I told you about
the night about Monique died.
Alma became a prisoner...
Gloria?!
Bree...
was set up
to take a fall.
And Mike was finally able
to remember the past.
Orson Hodge had
always assumed
that the moment
before he died,
his entire life would
flash before his eyes.
But as he fell from the roof of
the Fairview Memorial Hospital,
it wasn't his
life he saw.
It was one night
in particular.
Monique?
I've got wonderful news.
Bonnes nouvelles!
Monique?
There's been
an accident.
Oh, my God.
What have you done?
It was self-defense.
I came to tell her to stay away
from you. She attacked me.
Mother...
she's dead.
I know.
And I'm sorry,
but what's done is done.
What are you doing?
I'm calling the police.
No! I'll go to jail.
You killed someone!
I'm your mother!
You've got to help me!
But I loved her.
I once lost someone
I loved, thanks to you.
You owe me.
Hello?
Ms. Polier?
I've got that part
for the sink.
Hello?
Ms. Polier?
Ah, I'm sorry.
I'm Monique's boyfriend.
She's upstairs lying down.
She wasn't feeling well.
Well, I'll just finish up with the
sink and get out of your hair.
Look, why don't you
let me take care of that?
I mean, I'm pretty handy,
and it's getting late.
I don't mind staying.
I've got it under control.
Here, let me, uh,
let me pay you.
That should cover it.
Thanks.
Oh, hey...
Don't forget
your wrench.
You handled that
very well, son.
Now help me
find a tarp.
What are you doing?
You don't want her identified
through dental records, do you?
I must say,
I never realized your
job was so difficult.
It's not enough to kill her.
You have to desecrate
her body, too?
Get away from her!
Now look what
you've done!
I think my damn
hip's broken.
Help me.
Yes...
Orson Hodge had
always assumed
that his life would
flash before his eyes
the moment
before he died.
Luckily, for Orson...
That moment...
I got a pulse!
Let's get him inside!
Was not scheduled for today.

The first light
of sunrise.
The sound of
the cat purring.
The smell of
fresh coffee.
Yes, there are many things
a housewife
likes to wake up to.
But an unexpected
guest in her bed...
is not one of them.
Zach?
You're... in your
underwear.
Well, I needed to put on something
to get the morning paper.
You've been
here all night?
Sure.
I'm not one of those guys who
gets up and leaves right after.
Right after what?
Do you wanna
hear me say it?
Fine.
You were...
amazing.
Okay, listen to me
very carefully,
and this is no time
to be vague.
What exactly
was I amazing at?
Please tell me that
once contained a mint.
After a few drinks,
you told me how
lonely you were,
and that I was the kindest man
you'd met in a few years, and, uh...
then you kissed me.
And then you took off your...
Okay, okay, stop talking.
I'm getting nauseous.
This is so great.
I have so many
awesome plans for us.
"Us. "
Oh, man. It feels so
good to say that.
Oh, God.
Here it comes.
Would you like me
to hold your hair, honey?
No!
Hey, what are
you doing?
I'm lying in bed, thinking
about the opening tonight,
when it hits me...
We could run
out of breadsticks.
Oh, honey, you
have had, what,
four hours sleep in
the past three days?
You need rest. Who cares
if we run out of breadsticks?
I do!
Tonight's the most
important night of my life.
Everything's
gotta be perfect.
Here. Try that.
It's good.
No. Too salty.
If they're salty,
we'll sell more beer.
See? You're a genius.
Don't patronize me!
Oh, my God.
This is gonna be a disaster.
Hey, chill out.
You're acting like I did when
I was six months pregnant.
Uh, excuse me.
You were hitting people.
Only two.
And the mailman had the good
taste never to bring that up again.
Come on. Let's go
get some sleep.
The dough maker and the
chairs get delivered at noon.
I know. I'm the one
that put in the order.
I will handle anything
that needs to be done.
And you, take these
and get some sleep.
Come on. We need you
at your best tonight.
You're right.
I'm sorry. Crazy.
Honey glaze.
Honey glaze will cut the
salt in the breadsticks.
Tom, I do not need to be
pregnant to kick your ass.
Now go.
Go on.
Andrew, you're here.
What happened to me?
You kinda had
an accident.
You fell off
our ladder.
Oh, that's right.
Is Orson here?
Yeah, he's at
the hospital but,
he's not
exactly visiting.
Suicide?
No. Orson would never
try to kill himself.
The police are wrong.
It must have been an accident.
But they found his footprints
on the trunk of his car.
The only reason he'd
be up there is to jump.
But why?
Maybe he was
feeling guilty.
For what?
Mom, I looked
at that ladder.
Someone sawed
through the rung.
And you think...
I heard you two in your
room the other day.
You told him to turn
himself in or else...
The next day,
you fall and nearly die.
You think that's
a coincidence?
And you say he's
just down the hall?
Yeah, but don't worry.
I told them not to
let him near you,
and we're gonna get you
home as soon as we can.
Can I help you?
I'm here to pick up
my wife's belongings.
Jane Hainsworth?
Oh, yes.
I'm so sorry
for your loss.
I'll be right back.
You doing okay?
Not really, but having
you here helps.
Oh, hey, Mrs. Mayer.
Andrew, what are you
doing at the hospital?
You haven't heard?
Hey.
Susan.
I just heard from
Andrew what happened.
I had to come see you.
If you want me
to go, uh...
No, no. Come in.
I know we've
been fighting.
Something like this happens, it just
puts everything into perspective.
I am so sorry.
It was all my fault.
If I hadn't got so caught
up in protecting Mike...
Susan, stop.
Mike is innocent.
He had nothing to do with
Monique Polier's murder.
Do you know
something?
Yes, and I intend
to go to the police.
Oh, my God.
Does this have something
to do with Orson's accident?
I can't tell you
right now.
You're just gonna have to
trust me. Can you do that?
Of course.
I should let you rest.
So we're back
to being friends?
We never
really stopped.
Um, excuse me. These
things don't belong to Jane.
Are you sure?
Oh, every couple
has their secrets,
But I'm pretty sure she
wasn't a closet whittler.
"Mike Delfino. "
Oh, these are
Mike's things?
Yep. Someone made
a big mistake.
Helen, you screwed
up the labels again!
He had an engagement
ring with him.
Ooh, that's pretty.
You know, Mike and
I are good friends.
I could return these
things to him, if you like.
Sorry. He'll have
to pick 'em up himself.
It's hospital policy.
It's also hospital policy to put the
right labels on the right boxes!
Ian!
Ian, you're not
gonna believe this.
Bree just told me she can
prove Mike's innocent.
What?
It's true.
He's gonna be a free man.
Isn't that great?
Yes, it's bloody
fantastic.
Here.
I'm gonna go get Bree some
flowers. I'll be right back.
No, no, that's great news.
Thank you, doctor.
So Orson's gonna
pull through?
You'd rather
he didn't?
No.
I just don't know what he's gonna
tell the police when he wakes up.
It wasn't your fault.
Orson, falling off that roof
was an accident, right?
Well, sort of.
Sort of?
Depending on what
Orson tells them,
I could get charged
with attempted murder.
Well, I'm so glad she has
you to take care of her,
and of course your Mom
comes first, Andrew.
And I wouldn't even ask
except, you know,
we're opening tonight-
Chairs are here.
Oh, God. Seriously?
Fantastic. Thank you.
It's just two quick hours,
and then we'll get you right
back home with your Mom.
Thank you, Andrew.
Okay. Bye-bye.
Did you finish folding
the takeout menus?
You never asked
me to do that.
I shouldn't have to tell you every little
thing, you know. Show some initiative.
Wait.
Where are my chairs?
I didn't order these.
You're Lynette Scavo?
Yes.
Well, then you
ordered these.
No. Why would I order 50 high
chairs for the opening of a pizzeria?
I don't know.
I thought it was one of
those kiddie pizza places
with the games and
the animatronic rats.
Give me that.
Easy there, sally.
"Animatronic rats. "
Where do they find you people?
Okay, okay,
here it is. See?
I ordered 50 of
item number 7-3...
Did we find
the mistake?
I switched
the 7 and the 1.
So... we're
both wrong.
Now this place opens
in five hours.
How long will it
take to fix this?
Hi. I need to rent 50
chairs by tonight at 5:00.
What?
Why not?
What do you mean,
it's bar mitzvah season?
There's no such thing.
You still have five.
I will take those. Scavo.
Okay, that brings us to 22.
Javi, Rico, we got
chairs to find. Move it.
Looks like someone crawled into
a bottle of Merlot last night.
I sort of threw myself
a little birthday party.
So if you don't mind, I'd like
to get back to my dry heaving.
Quick question.
Was that Zach Young I saw leaving
your house 8:00 this morning?
Uh, oh, yeah. Um...
He just came by to, uh...
drop off a birthday card.
Really cute little
cat with balloons.
All right, bye.
Follow-up.
Why was Zach in your driveway
at 7:00 this morning...
In his underwear?
We had sex
last night!
What?!
I mean, I think we did.
That's what he told me.
Weren't you there?
No, I don't remember
anything!
I just woke up, and he
was in bed next to me.
Thanks again, Gaby.
Hey, Carlos.
If you don't remember,
then how can you be sure
that you and Zach had sex?
Well, we were
both half-naked,
and there was
a condom wrapper.
And he said I was amazing,
which totally sounds like me.
He thinks we're a couple now.
You have to help me.
I am not getting involved.
God, I can't believe you bagged
another neighborhood kid.
Where are you going?
To warn the Scavo boys.
I wanna speak
to my wife.
She's resting.
If we can get back
to these questions...
I fell off a roof.
I need a physician,
not a psychiatrist.
Well, I'm afraid
it's hospital policy
when there's a suspected
suicide attempt.
I didn't try
to kill myself.
But you do
have a certain...
history?
You spent most of 1976
in a psychiatric hospital.
I don't care
to discuss that.
You won't be leaving
here until we do.
My parents were
very religious.
When I was 16,
my father had an affair,
caused quite a scandal
at our church.
He became depressed.
He started drinking heavily.
My mother grew
concerned.
She didn't like
leaving him alone.
One night, she had
to visit a sick friend,
and she asked me
to keep an eye on him.
But I had made plans
with friends.
I thought I could
duck out for a while.
When I got home,
I found him in the bathroom.
You blamed yourself?
I didn't need to.
Mother blamed me
enough for both of us.
That must have caused quite
a strain in your relationship.
Yes.
But now and then,
she suggests little ways
I might make it up to her.
Yes, I'm calling to check
on the status of a patient.
Last name Hodge.
What do you mean,
"which Hodge"?
Gloria!
Thank God. I thought
you'd forgotten about me.
When are you
letting me out of here?
It won't be long now.
In fact, something interesting
happened last night.
Orson tried
to kill himself.
Oh, my goodness.
Is he okay?
He'll be fine.
My point is,
Suicide is hardly the act
of a happily married man.
Gloria, for God
sake, give it up.
He doesn't love me.
He will, dear.
Bree will be
gone soon,
and he'll need a good woman
like you to console him.
What are you gonna
do to Bree?
Gloria?
Gloria?
Oh, hey, hon.
Hey.
Did you get
some sleep?
Yes. I'm still kind of groggy
from those pills, but...
And now I'm awake.
Okay, little mix-up
with the new chairs.
Which you were
in charge of.
Okay, okay,
we could point fingers,
but what's important is forgetting
about what we expected,
and focusing on what we
have, which isn't so bad.
I mean, all the different
kinds of chairs
give the place a kind
of bohemian vibe.
Plus, if we get a lot of babies,
look, we're just totally set.
Tom, I'm sorry.
I am. I'm sorry.
I just, I realize
it's not... perfect.
But...
Please say something.
What can I say,
Lynette?
It is what it is.
Why do I have
to babysit Mom?
All my friends are
gonna be at the opening.
Austin was gonna
sneak us beer!
Damn it, Danielle,
I have to work!
Our mother's lying
helpless upstairs
'cause her husband
tried to kill her.
Now for just one night,
could you try to be responsible?
I liked you better when
you were a psychopath!
Here you go.
Oh, you're... here.
I wouldn't have
missed it.
You know how I feel
about Lynette and Tom.
Look, Zach,
I'm glad you're here.
I've been wanting
to talk about us.
Me, too. You, uh,
being in my life now,
having the connection
that we do,
this is really the first time that I've been
happy since my mother killed herself.
Would you excuse
me a second?
Of course, baby.
Hurry back.
I am in hell.
I just tried to break up with
Zach, and the little twerp
played the dead
Mommy card.
Well, you can't let him
make you feel guilty.
But I am guilty.
I don't remember how
we ended up in bed together.
Maybe I led him on.
I gotta be sensitive here.
Could you threaten
him for me?
What?
You know,
intimidate him.
Do the whole jealous,
latin ex-husband thing you do.
Tell him if you can't
have me, nobody can.
Forget it. I'm not gonna
to do that to poor Zach.
Hey, I am looking
out for Zach, too.
If I dump him,
it'll destroy him emotionally.
Better to scare him off.
Please?
Fine.
Thank you!
Okay, look,
there he goes.
Go!
Go get all cholo
on his ass.
Hey, Mr. Solis.
Hey.
Look, I need to talk to you
about something.
It's a little
awkward, but...
Mr. Solis?
What?
You were just saying that
something was awkward?
Never mind.
Forget that
I said anything.
Hey. So how'd it go?
You did not have sex
with Zach young.
Really?
Did he tell you that?
He didn't have to.
What?
I was standing next
to him at the urinal.
I don't care how
drunk you were.
If you had sex with him,
you'd remember.
Little Zach Young?
Well, just how much
would I have remembered?
Hey. What are
you doing here?
I thought Bree
might like some soup.
It's my own
special recipe.
I'm surprised
to find you home.
I thought the whole street
was going to Scavo's tonight.
Well, I was
supposed to go,
but Andrew said I had to
stay home and babysit Mom.
Well, that's just silly.
A vibrant young lady like
you should be at the party,
turning boys' heads.
You go.
I'll look after
your mother.
You mean it?
Just take her
dinner up first.
I don't think I can manage
the tray with my cane.
Thanks, Grandma.
You're the best!
This soup
smells so good.
You wanna score some points?
Don't say I brought it.
Tell her you
made it yourself.
Hey!
Hello?
Over here!
Honey, there is
a line out the door.
We are gonna
make a killing tonight.
I'm happy for you.
For us.
Now it's "us"?
Because I thought I was the one
who was trying to ruin everything.
Hey, look,
I know I overreacted...
Yes, you did.
But I have customers.
The place came
out great, huh?
Sure did.
Looks like, uh,
the whole street's here.
Yeah.
Except for Orson,
who fell off a roof.
You know anything
about that?
Why would you
think that?
I heard you talking to Carlos.
Now answer the question.
I can't talk
about it here.
It's complicated.
It always is with you.
Hey. I just had a slice
of pizza. It's pretty good.
Is it really good,
or are you just pretending
you had a slice?
You and I did not
have sex. Admit it!
Of course we did.
Zach!
How can you claim to care
about me and lie to my face?
I'm sorry.
I'm tired of just
being your friend.
I thought if you saw me as a lover,
you can think of me as a man, not...
not a boy.
Zach, a real
man is honest.
All you've ever
tried to do Is bribe
and trick me into falling
in love with you.
A little advice next time?
Don't play games.
Just stand up and
be the kind of man
a woman would be proud
to share her life with.
Hello!
I think it's high time
to make a toast.
Tom, where are you?
Where... Ah.
Tom, you did it.
There are a lot of people in this room
that didn't think you could pull it off.
Okay, well,
maybe just me.
Anyway, congratulations.
The pizza is excellent,
and the service is sublime.
Cheers.
Cheers.
Speech!
Thank you.
Thank you for coming.
It means everything
in the world to me.
I gotta tell you, when I arrived here this
afternoon, I saw all these weird chairs,
I thought the evening was
gonna be a total disaster.
But now when I look out,
I can't even see the chairs.
I just see people eating,
laughing and
having a great time.
It's absolutely perfect.
And none of this
would've happened
without my amazing
partner Lynette.
Who, uh...
To...
I'm sorry.
I'm a little...
I think what my husband
is trying to say is,
if you really want to test a marriage,
open a restaurant together.
Anyway, thank
you for coming.
Eat a lot and
come back,
'cause our kids
need braces.
Actually, as long as everyone
has their glasses raised,
I have something that
I would like to say.
Well, I thought of waiting
for the perfect romantic spot
in which to ask
this question,
but being here tonight,
enveloped by so much love
and warmth, I realize that, um,
this is the perfect
romantic spot.
Susan Mayer...
Drop the pizza.
Will you make me the happiest man
in the world and be my wife?
Absolutely, yes!
Ladies and gentlemen,
please, I have something
that I'd like to say also.
Gabrielle Solis...
Will you marry me?
Should I clap?
No, there will be
no clapping!
You, moron,
come with me!
Time for your pills,
Mr. Hodge.
It's after 6:00?
I need to speak with my wife.
What room is she in?
Your wife checked out.
Already?
She was very eager
to get home.
Don't worry.
She'll be fine.
I have to talk to her.
Oh, that reminds me.
Your mother called.
She said she didn't
want to wake you up,
and she wanted to make sure
we'd be keeping you overnight.
Moms are like that,
so protective.
Bree, it's me.
Are you there?
Please, pick up.
Bree?
Please, somebody,
pick up the phone.
I know that
you're mad.
I'm not mad,
Zach. I'm done!
But you said
to be honest.
I did not say to
humiliate me!
I'm sorry. All right?
I was just trying...
What do you
want from me?
I want you to
leave me alone!
This friends thing isn't gonna work
'cause you're always gonna want more,
and I'm never gonna
love you... ever.
20 years from now when you're
all middle-aged and alone,
you'll regret this.
Okay, I'll take
my chances.
Thought you
might need this.
Bless you.
So how did it go
with Seabiscuit?
He's devastated.
Of course.
It's my fault.
I should've known he couldn't handle
the whole "let's be friends" thing.
I don't blame him.
I'm having kind of a hard time
myself being just your friend,
Watching you
with other guys,
being your confidant.
Really?
I think it's been nice.
For you, maybe.
Look, seriously, I don't know how much
longer I'm gonna be able to keep this up.
Well, hang in there
as long as you can,
'cause I still need you.
I'll do my best.
What are you
doing here?
I have better things to
do than babysit Mom.
She's fine.
Gloria's watching her.
What?
I told you Mom's ready to
go to the cops about Orson.
How could you leave her at
home with his crazy mother?
She brought soup!
Gloria?
What are you
doing here?
I came to take
care of you.
I'm so sleepy.
Good. Then the
pills are working.
Andrew?
Danielle?
They're gone.
It's just us.
Now...
You rest, hon.
I'm gonna draw you
a nice, warm bath.
Oh, Bree...
I wish I could make you understand
how deeply I regret having to do this.
Monique...
that was easy.
She was a slut.
You're a good woman.
You didn't know Orson
already had a wife.
But he did.
And he made a vow
to her before God.
What sort of mother would
I be if I let him break it?
I'm sorry.
But I will not let him
be his father's son.
Wake up, Mr. Hodge.
I've got dinner.
That water's not
too hot, is it?
No.
It's just right.
Mom? Are you all right?
Andrew?
You've done this
before, haven't you?
No!
Is she all right?
She will be.
Get her some blankets
and some dry clothes.
Orson?
Orson!
Something's wrong.
I think I'm...
having a stroke.
You need an
ambulance, mother.
It's too bad there's no one here
who'd dream of calling you one.
What are you doing?
I don't want her
dying in our house.
Hey there.
Are you all right?
Your mother...
She tried to kill me.
Don't worry about her.
She's never gonna
hurt you again,
and neither will Alma.
Alma?
She's dead.
What?
I don't know what happened,
but she's gone.
And she's taking
our troubles with her.
Tomorrow morning,
one of our neighbors
will stumble on
a gruesome surprise.
Two bodies side by side.
The police will conclude
that Alma fell from the roof,
and when my mother found her,
she suffered a stroke.
When they search
the house,
they'll find the note Alma wrote
when she faked her suicide,
and next to it, a bag
containing Monique's teeth.
In the face of
such evidence,
they'll have no choice but to drop
the charges against Mike Delfino.
Now, you and I are gonna take that
honeymoon we never got around to.
I'd love that.
What about
your mother?
After all the things she's done,
she's just gonna get off scot-free?
Thank you, doctor.
I know you did all you could.
Good news, mother.
The doctor said your stroke has
left you completely paralyzed.
You can't even speak.
Which means all our secrets
will be safe forever.
Oh, here's the best part.
Your brain is
functioning normally.
So I don't have to worry
about putting you in jail.
You're already there.
Now,
I'm gonna turn
your head,
so you can watch
me walk away.
You don't wanna miss it,
'cause it's the last time
you will ever see me.
A surprising thing
happened to Orson Hodge
as he'd left Fairview
Memorial Hospital.
His life began to flash
before his eyes.
But it wasn't his
past he saw.
It was his future.
Ordinary suburban days,
filled with ordinary
suburban moments,
each made beautiful because
of the housewife by his side.
Yes, Orson could finally envision
a life free from secrets and pain.
And he couldn't wait
for it to begin.
Honey,
I'm home.
Previously on Desperate Housewives...
Mike's plan to
propose to Susan...
These things don't
belong to Jane.
"Mike Delfino. "
Was a surprise to Ian.
Monique was murdered...
There's been an accident.
And Orson...
Don't forget your wrench.
Passed the blame.
A connection was made...
A heart was broken...
And Bree buried
her husband Rex.
My name is
Rex Van De Kamp.
I always hated cemeteries
when I was alive.
Now that I'm dead,
I like 'em even less.
Here's where
I used to live.
A whole lot nicer,
don't you think?
The place hasn't changed
much since I left,
as tasteful
and tidy as ever.
Everything perfect...
at least on
the surface.
My family was
the same way.
Look at us.
You'd never guess how ticked off
we all were the day this was taken,
but that was the thing
about us Van De Kamps.
To really fit in,
you had to have a smile
that gave away nothing.
Like my son Andrew.
To look at him, you'd never know
he spent six months on the streets
supporting himself with
panhandling and light prostitution.
Or my daughter Danielle.
Does she look like
the kind of girl
who'd seduce her
middle-aged History teacher?
I mean, they're my kids,
and I love 'em,
but I'm pretty darn
relieved to be dead.
Here's the clown
Bree replaced me with,
Orson.
I don't mind saying,
he's creeped me out
right from the get-go.
To me, he always has
the shifty look of a guy
who knows where
the bodies are buried...
and he should know.
He buried them.
But Bree thinks
he's sir Galahad.
The kids like him.
And all my friends...
now his friends.
So it pleases me to know that
at least one of my old neighbors
sees right
through the guy.
Mike, you just
missed Bree.
She's off to
see her folks,
and then we're finally
taking our honeymoon.
Yeah, not a bad time for
you to leave town, is it?
Well, I don't follow you.
I just keep thinking about
that night at Monique's place.
How you made sure
I left with my wrench.
The one with
her blood on it.
Well, it was
your wrench.
Why are you
rehashing this?
My ex-wife confessed
in her suicide note.
The case is closed.
Maybe it shouldn't be.
What do you think
the police would say
if they knew you were
there that night?
What do you
think they'd say
if they knew you
threw me off a roof?
Oh, Mike.
We could make so much
trouble for each other,
or we can forget what
we think we know
and be good neighbors.
Your call.
No, Orson Hodge
isn't exactly the guy
I'd have picked
to head my family,
but I'll give
him one thing...
He's got the smile
down cold.

Take a drive down
any street in suburbia.
You know what
you're gonna see?
Desperate women.
That's right.
One unhappy housewife
after another,
each completely
miserable...
in her own
unique way.
But I don't want
to talk about them.
No, I want to talk
about their men
and what
happens to a guy
when that special lady
in his life starts to lose it.
Like my friend Carlos.
He used to
have it all.
Hot wife, tons of dough,
then bam!
She gets a divorce, and
he gets stuck with the bill.
But does he sit
around and complain
like your average
hausfrau?
No, sir.
He finds creative ways
to get what you
can out of life.
Hey, bro!
Where you off to?
Oh, the hospital called.
They found the stuff I had on
me the night of the accident.
Coma, murder rap.
You've had a tough year, buddy.
You know what you need?
Some pampering.
Tomorrow you're checking
in to a nice hotel.
Room service,
jacuzzi, my treat.
You trying to get me
out of the house?
Mike, why would I...
Okay, there's this girl.
I knew it.
Dude, she's a dancer,
and if her online profile's
any indication,
she's a complete freak. We're
talking serious Daddy issues.
Look, I'll stay in my room.
You'll never hear me.
Yeah, but
you'll hear me.
I'm kind of exuberant by nature,
and when I haven't had it in a while,
I kind of do this shrieking
thing that, I mean, is kinda...
Okay. All right, I'll go.
Just stop talking.
Thanks, pal. I wouldn't want it
to put a weird spin on our friendship.
Too late.
This is my friend Tom.
Have you heard what
he's been up to lately?
This silly bastard opened up
his own pizza place.
He thought that
if he was his own boss,
he could sleep in
as late as he wanted,
but the problem with that
logic is that married guys...
Hey. It's after 9:00.
Come on, Thomasina,
it's time to get up.
Are never
their own boss.
Are you as
tired as I am?
More, but I'm tougher,
and I complain less.
Not when you give birth,
and you do that a lot.
Yeah?
Before I forget, you got
a call from Chez Nous
confirming your reservation
for our anniversary.
You heard that?
I wanted that to be a surprise.
Well, we've been going there
for the last seven years.
It's not exactly a surprise.
Anyway, I hope
you don't mind,
but I canceled.
You canceled? Why?
Honestly, I just don't feel up
to going out this year.
But it's our anniversary.
It's our ninth anniversary.
Come on.
The "big nine. "
That's a year longer than my
Mom said we would be married.
Come on.
We gotta party down.
I'm exhausted.
Honestly, all I wanna do is pawn
the kids off on somebody else,
take a long bath
and be in bed by 8:00.
Okay.
Oh, thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Hold it.
What about my sex?
I always get sex
on our anniversary.
We can still have sex.
Just try not to wake me.
This is Ian.
Don't really
know the guy,
but Susan Mayer
seems to like him.
The other night, he surprised
her with a proposal.
She said yes, but he's
still a little skittish
about the competition.
But Ian knows
that if love is war...
Hey. Where were you off
to so early this morning?
Sometimes you gotta bring
out the big artillery.
I should have had it
when I proposed.
It's not very good
form, I know.
Ian, oh,
you can't be serious.
Oh, that's just...
too much.
It's huge.
Well, we could go smaller.
Oh, no. No one's saying smaller.
No, that's crazy talk.
Rock me.
Oh, my!
Oh, it's so beautiful!
Oh, okay.
Okay, nobody move.
I got it.
I knew I should have
measured your finger.
No, it's okay.
I can get it resized.
You should go to the
jeweler's right now,
and when you get back, we can go and
look at some places for the reception.
Reception?
Yes, I was hoping we could pull
this together for next month.
What's the rush?
Am I pregnant?
Of course not.
I just, well, I just can't
wait to be married to you.
Are you sure?
'Cause you seem
a little anxious.
What would I have
to be anxious about?
Again,
sorry for the mix-up.
If you could just
sign right here...
I don't remember this.
You sure that's mine?
It was on you the night
you were admitted.
I got hit by a car.
I don't remember anything
about that night.
Well, it looks like you were
gonna propose to someone.
"Susan, be mine
forever. Mike. "
Does that ring a bell?
Sure does.
Hey, Carlos.
Hi.
I have a little visitor
that I thought you might
get a kick out of seeing.
Remember my little boy?
Hey, Travers. How you
doing? Put her there.
I'm Carlos Solis.
I think you came by my house
one time trick-or-treating.
I remember.
You gave me a protein bar.
Right.
Sorry. My wife
forgot to buy candy.
Hey, is that football I hear?
Go on.
Check it out.
I didn't know your son
was coming for a visit.
Neither did I.
His father just dumped him
here for four weeks
so he could jet off with his
doctors without borders buddies
and fix cleft
palates in Kenya.
Selfish son of a bitch.
Come on. I mean,
you barely even see him.
It'll be fun.
A chance to bond.
Yeah, that's true,
but, um...
I have this major
party tonight,
and I was wondering if maybe you could
just keep an eye on him for a few hours.
Sorry. I can't tonight.
Come on! You love kids.
I mean, didn't you rent
that chinese chick
so that you could have
one of your own?
I have a date, too,
with a chick so hot I had to turn off
the smoke alarms in my house.
Fine.
Travers, come on.
Let's go.
This isn't
a child-friendly house.
Bye, Travers.
Wow, she's a looker.
I'll say.
Hey, what time's
that fund-raiser?
You got an hour.
Well, then...
Let's have
a little fun.
Look what you did!
Don't yell at me.
I'm just a passenger.
Well, your driver's an idiot!
Hey, it's not
Clyde's fault.
I mean, what man wouldn't be
distracted by such beauty?
Now you're
hitting on me?
I was talking
about the car.
Well, good.
I'm glad you like it,
'cause you're gonna
pay to fix this.
Of course.
$5,000 cover it?
Five?
Well, sure, I guess.
I'd rather not file
an insurance claim.
My opponent could find out
and try to make me look bad.
Opponent?
Oh, well, I guess you
don't read the papers.
I'm running for mayor.
My name's Victor Lang,
and I hope I can
count on your vote.
I think I'd rather vote
for the other guy.
You know, the one
who didn't wreck my car?
you're off
your game.
You didn't even get
a phone number.
Oh, don't worry.
I'll be seeing her again.
How can you
be so sure?
I didn't sign
the check.
What the hell
are you doing?
We neeto talk.
No, we don't. Get out.
Please. You won't
return my calls.
Well, I've been busy.
Plus, my Mom caught you
naked on top of my friend.
Just read this, and if you
still don't want to talk to me,
then I'll never
bother you again.
Fine, I'll read it,
but only if you get out
of the car right now.
Now? But the hot
wax is starting.
I know.
Ticktock.
You're still in there?
How long does it take
to pluck that unibrow?
Leave me alone!
Danielle, I have to be
at work in ten minutes.
Now can I please just come
in and brush my teeth?
I'm having a really
bad day, all right?
Just go away!
I'm gonna have
a really bad day, too.
I tend not to get tipped
when my breath stinks.
I'm pregnant.
Mike, what are
you doing here?
Oh, hey, I'm just
selling some old jewelry.
I spoke to my manager.
There's gonna be a charge
to remove the inscription,
but we can refund you
for the engagement ring.
That'll be fine.
Was that the ring
that you bought for...
Yeah.
Can I help you?
Yeah, I have
to get this sized.
It's a little loose.
Do you know
your size?
No.
Congratulations,
by the way.
Ian... seems great.
Thanks.
I can't find my sizer.
Here.
Try this one.
Oh, no...
How's that fit?
It's perfect.
Great.
Can I have it back now?
Sorry.
Hey, you've got a cousin in
the limo business, don't you?
Actually, I've got a cousin In the "limo
as a front for prostitution" business.
He's in jail.
Why do you ask?
Oh, I'm just planning a big
thing for my anniversary.
Aren't you just gonna go to Chez
Boring, like you do every year?
No.
Lynette's so over that, she was
ready to bag the whole night,
so got me thinking.
Nine years.
Time to shake things up.
Now I'm planning the greatest
anniversary of all time.
Check this out.
Lynette's gonna open the
door to find a limo driver
with a dozen
roses and a card.
The card is gonna tell
her to go with the guy,
not ask any questions.
He'll drive her
out to the country.
He'll drop her off,
Then drive away.
Just as she is starting
to freak out,
I show up in a
horse-drawn carriage,
which takes us up
to Whitman's bluff,
where we eat
a catered dinner,
listen to
a professional violinist.
Afterwards,
when we come home,
I'm sure Lynette will think
of a way to thank me.
You're one romantic
son of a bitch.
I have my moments.
Of course I'm not questioning
mayor Johnson's family values.
I'm sure they're what prompted him
to put his sisters, brother-in-law
and six of his cousins
on the city payroll.
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have to cut this interview short.
I have some very important
business to attend to.
Ms. Solis,
What a nice surprise.
Are you here to make
a contribution to my campaign?
Not exactly.
Oh, no.
Did I forget to s...
I'm so sorry.
Let me make
it up to you.
I'll take you to dinner.
My treat.
It would be your treat.
I'm a hot date.
What's in it for me?
Well, I have, uh,
"an ingratiating wit,
trustworthy smile,"
According to the
"Plainview Herald. "
Yeah. Check, please.
My family also owns
Lang Enterprises.
Dad's worth a...
few hundred mil.
Well, a girl's gotta eat.
Great. I'll take
you to Cucina.
There's no place
harder to get into.
That's what you think.
Mike, this is completely
unnecessary.
My paying for your
lawyer was a favor.
It wasn't a loan.
I appreciate it, but I just
don't like to owe anybody.
Well, I just don't want you
to have any trouble
getting back
on your feet.
No, it's fine. I had a windfall.
The hospital
gave me back
an engagement ring
I didn't even know I had.
Oh, really?
So you sold it?
You should have kept it
till the right girl comes along.
Well, I...
couldn't give this ring
to just anyone.
Oh, right, the, um,
the inscription.
How'd you know
it was inscribed?
Well, isn't that the custom?
I just assumed it was.
Well, listen, I've got
to get some fresh rags.
Thanks for the check.
I'll see you around.
Oh, you can
count on it.
Are you sure?
Yes.
I peed on five
different sticks.
Would you put that burrito away?
It's making me nauseous.
Join the club.
Look, I know your parents are
religious, but I know this clinic.
Absotely not!
So what other choice
do we have?
Well, gee, you could,
like, uh, marry me?
Marry you?!
I can't stand you.
Nice way to talk to the
mother of your child!
Oh, God.
Bathroom.
Hey.
Julie.
Hi. Uh, hey.
Your door was open.
Can I come in?
What are you
doing here?
I read your letter.
I had no idea
it would be so sweet.
I could really tell
it came from your heart.
I'm embarrassed
to admit, I...
cried.
My aunt Edie sort of
tied one on last night.
Anyway, I guess
what I'm saying is...
Okay.
"Okay"?
We can try again.
Julie, that's great!
And I want to
talk about this,
but I just kinda need
to take care of my aunt.
Can I call you
tomorrow?
Sure.
We're gonna have
to take things slow,
'cause it'll be a while
before I can trust you again.
I understand.
Thank you, Bruno.
The veal was excellent.
Feel like dessert?
No, thank you. I'm stuffed.
Then let me
propose a toast.
To a delightful evening,
and to the happy accident
that brought us together.
Victor, you are
so full of crap.
What?
There was no accident.
I know you told your
chauffeur to ram my car.
Why would I do that?
For the same reason you
"forgot" to sign the check.
You've been working me
since the second we met,
and I've been on to you
every step of the way.
What? What's so funny?
I just called you
a manipulative jerk.
I think
I underestimated you.
I also think this relationship
just got a lot more interesting.
There is no relationship.
This is our last date.
You didn't have any fun?
It was okay.
You know, you told a few good
jokes. you're sorta charming.
You're not bad-looking.
I just think I can do better.
Have you not noticed?
I'm a catch.
I have noticed,
and I'm throwing you back.
Gaby, let me tell
you something.
For my whole life,
whenever I've truly
wanted something,
I've always gotten it.
And tonight, right around the time
you were calling me a manipulative jerk,
I decided
I truly want you.
So brace yourself.
The chase is on.
You can chase me
all you want,
But trust me,
I'm way too
fast for you.
Bruno...
I'm gonna
marry that girl.
Can I just say
something?
You are way hotter
than your online profile.
So many guys say that.
What's wrong?
Oh, my friend's
kid is out there.
Hey, I got an idea.
Let's go upstairs.
I should warn you...
My therapist says
I'm sexually compulsive.
This could take hours.
Whatever your issues are,
we will work them out together.
It's almost 11:00. What is
he doing out therby himself?
I'm sure his folks
know he's out there.
Now relax.
I'm so sorry. I will be
right back. I promise.
Hey, Travers, what are
you doing out here?
Where's your Mom?
She had to go
visit a sick friend.
Come on.
No way. I didn't come over here
to babysit some little brat.
He can hear you.
I don't care.
Look, his mother's bound
to be home soon, all right?
Then we can pick up
where we left off.
Forget it.
I'm officially
no longer in the mood.
Sorry I ruined
your date.
That's okay.
She was
a very bad lady
who wanted to do very,
very bad things to me.
Night, Raoul.
Where the hell have you been?
Oh, I, uh...
ducked out...
just for an hour.
That's funny,
'cause I found Travers wandering
the streets three hours ago.
Look, he was
fine when I left.
I just didn't know
he'd go outside.
Yeah, you never know what
an 8 year old's gonna do.
That's why
you supervise him.
Hey, you don't get to judge me.
You don't have a kid.
Well, if I did,
I'd treat him a hell of
a lot better than you do.
Thank God he lives with
his father. I mean, come on.
What kind of
mother are you?
If you are done
lecturing me,
I would like
my son now.
He's asleep.
Come and get him
in the morning...
When you're sober.
Hey, buddy!
Your Mom's here for ya.
I know you think
I'm a terrible person.
I never said that.
Terrible mother, terrible person.
It's the same thing.
Because no matter
what else she does,
if a woman isn't a good mother,
she's a failure, right?
Look, um...
When I had Travers,
I knew I was in over my head,
and when Charles
and I split, I...
I gave him custody.
Because I wanted my son
to have the best life possible.
And that doesn't make me
a good mother, but...
I like to think it makes
me a realistic one.
Hey, Mom.
Hey, champ.
I missed you.
I missed you, too.
Guess what?
I've got so many fun things
for you to do today.
Cool.
Thanks for
the ice cream.
My pleasure.
I'll see you, little man.
Hey.
Travers said he's
staying at least a month.
Yeah.
So if you ever need
a babysitter, just yell.
I appreciate that.
Hey! Wait for me!
No, I don't want
a viola player.
I asked for a violinist. I don't
even know what a viola is.
Oh, it's just
a big violin?
Okay. Yeah, sure.
Okay, I'll see you at 8:00.
What was that?
It's just a little
surprise, okay?
Let it go.
"Let it go", that's cute.
Start talkin'.
I planned a little something
for our anniversary.
That is all
I'm gonna say.
Okay. Okay. Okay.
If we're doing this,
I need to buy you something.
What do you want? You don't
have to buy me anything.
Well, you didn't have
to plan anything,
but you did, even though
we had an agreement.
You like ties?
You're getting a tie.
What are you getting?
I have been dragging my ass
all day, and the only thought
that's kept me going
is the hot bath,
and now I have do my hair
and shave my legs.
So what do you
want to do, Lynette?
Just tell me what you want.
I told you what I want.
Hot bath, bed early,
but you choose not to listen.
Well, okay, I guess I can
just cancel the whole thing.
You can have your
dream evening alone,
and I'll get up a poker
game or something.
Thank you.
Hey. You know what? I've been
dragging my ass all day, too,
and you know what
got me through it?
The idea of doing
something special with you.
Happy anniversary.
All right. I'm off
to join your mother.
The hotel number's on the fridge
in case there's a problem.
Bree said her cell phone
isn't getting good reception.
Actually, we kinda
already have a problem.
Well, I'm already
late for my flight.
Can this wait a few
weeks till we're back?
Yeah, this could
wait a few weeks.
Oh, good.
I mean, heck, this particular
problem could wait...
nine months.
Good Lord.
How was your bath?
Oh, I couldn't relax.
I just kept replaying the fight
I had with Tom in my head.
Well, at least your husband
tries to be romantic.
Every anniversary, Gilbert
bought me an appliance.
The last one, he gave
me a vacuum cleaner.
He died two weeks later.
I didn't cry.
Who could that be?
Here.
All right. Here's
what we're thinking.
Clearly, the idea of the two of
you getting married is ridiculous.
So what do you
want me to do?
Glad you asked.
Bree and I have decided
that Danielle will join
us on our heymoon.
When we return, we'll tell our friends
she's decided to study abroad.
Once the baby is born and
adopted by a suitable family,
she'll come home.
What about me?
You leave.
Leave?
Get out of Fairview
and don't tell a soul why,
Not even your aunt.
I can't do that.
Why not?
Because I've got
responsibilities here.
People are counting on me.
Yeah, well, you should
have thought of that
before you impregnated
my stepdaughter.
I said I'm not leaving!
Easy there, turbo.
We'll be right back.
So who exactly
is counting on you?
Julie Mayer, maybe?
She gave me
another chance.
I can't leave if I've still
got a shot with her.
And what's gonna happen when Julie
finds out you knocked up my sister?
Didn't your stepdad just say no
one's gonna find out about that?
Okay.
Try this.
Julie's a nice girl,
and you, well...
you're a dog.
No knock.
I'm a dog lover myself,
but Julie deserves better.
You know you'll just
end up cheating on her.
No, I won't
hurt her again.
Sure you will.
Not right away.
Maybe you'll hold
out for six months,
but then it'll hurt
her even more.
Am I wrong?
You just have
to ask yourself
if you can be the kind of
guy she needs you to be.
If you can't...
walk away.
Beer is on the
house, guys.
Drink fast, get stupid,
lose money.
Mike!
Hey. How's it going, buddy?
Hey, you know,
uh, Orson, right?
Oh, yeah.
Hey, neighbor.
Hey, so let's get started, huh?
5 card stud? Two dollars ante?
Good evening, gentlemen.
Ian!
Hey... Ian.
Nice to see you, Mike.
What is fish and
chips doing here?
Susan asked me
to include him.
Said he always wanted
to learn how to play poker.
So we're going to give him
some very expensive lessons.
Be careful. He already
knows how to bluff.
Hey.
Hey. How's it going?
Good. Good, uh...
Just wanted to tell you, I have
to leave town for a while.
Really?
Is something wrong?
No, no, no.
It's just family stuff.
I don't know exactly
when I'll be back.
It could be a while,
though.
Okay.
I just want you
to know that...
It means a lot that you were willing
to give me a second chance.
You're, like, the only person
that's ever done that.
Austin...
What's going on?
Nothing, uh,
it's just...
I have to go.
Good-bye, Julie.
Austin!
I'll raise you.
Out.
Ah, another courageous
move for "foldilocks. "
All right. I'll call you.
Flush, king high.
Full house,
7s and knaves.
Jacks.
We call them jacks.
Boy, this is your
lucky room.
Yes, I heard about your
engagement the other night.
Congratulations.
Yeah, about that, Ian,
Was that proposal spontaneous,
or did you have it all planned?
It was entirely planned.
I thought it would be
the ideal occasion.
Well, if it was planned,
why didn't you have a ring?
Well, I thought Susan might
like to choose the ring herself.
Ante up, boys.
So why'd she pick a ring
that was too big for her?
How did you
know that?
Guys, guys, guys, guys,
we came here to play cards.
Why are we talking
about jewelry?
Sorry, Tom, but I just found out
I bought a ring for Susan myself.
It was in my pocket that night
some son of a bitch ran me over.
Hey, Tom's right.
We should focus on the game.
After our talk,
I called the hospital.
They said my ring got in
with your wife's stuff.
So you saw it
before I did...
The same day you
proposed to Susan.
And your point is?
That that's why you were
in such a big hurry.
You wanted to seal the deal before
I found out about the ring and told her.
Do you think
I'm afraid of you?
Maybe you should be.
What do you think
Susan would say
if she found out why your
proposal was so spontaneous?
Guys, can we just play?
I'm trying.
Fine.
Deal.
Hello?
Mr. Scavo,
It's Lamar from
the limo service.
I got a flat, so I might be late
picking up you and your wife.
What are you talking about?
I canceled you.
No, you didn't.
Yes, I did. I left
you a message.
I must have
missed it.
Anyway, I dropped your wife off,
right where you told me.
Oh, God. When?
About two hours ago.
Guys, lock up
when you're done.
I'll open.
I'm out.
And I'll raise you.
You want a beer?
Hell, Tom's gone.
Let's go open up the good stuff.
Well...
Looks like
it's just you and me,
if you're still in.
With this hand?
You bet I am.
I'll re-raise.
And raise again.
Your stack's
looking kinda small.
Will you take a check?
You know I can't
match that.
How about this, then?
You win, you keep the money, and
you tell Susan whatever you want.
I win, you keep your
mouth shut about the ring,
and you leave me
and Susan alone.
Deal.
How was the game?
I won.
Lynette, I am so sorry.
I am so sorry!
You see, there was supposed to
be a horse-drawn carriage and...
Good. You got the flowers.
Coffee?
Yes, please.
Yeah, she likes
coffee, too. Thanks.
I'm really, really,
really sorry...
Please stop apologizing.
I appreciate what you
were trying to do.
It was a lovely though that
just went hideously, hideously,
hideously wrong.
Wait till the kids find out
that you saw a real coyote.
Hideously.
Well, I learned
my lesson.
Never again.
No more surprises.
From now on, I'll do
exactly what you say.
Don't... you... dare.
What?
I had a lot of time
to think tonight,
and I realized
you were right.
We have to keep
the romance going,
no matter how
tired we are.
The only thing worse thaor just
going through the motions Is not...
bothering to go
through the motions.
So you want me to
surprise you next year?
Knock yourself out.
Just wait, 'cause I will think
of something even better.
Well, after this year,
I would be happy
with any date
that included
food and shelter.
Nine years.
Nine years...
And I have loved
every minute of it.
Me, too.
Take a drive down any
street in suburbia.
You know what
you're gonna see?
A bunch of guys wearing
the same expression.
It's a look that says,
"Oh, crap.
My dreams are never
gonna come true. "
"I'll never have a life
free from scandal. "
"I'll never have
a son of my own. "
"I'll never hold her
in my arms again. "
"I'll never get to
tell her how I feel. "
Yeah, the suburbs are filled with
a lot of men who have given up hope.
Of course, every once in a
while you do come across
some lucky S.O.B. whose
dreams have all come true.
You know how
you spot them?
They're the ones who
can't stop smiling.
Don't you just
hate those guys?
Previously on Desperate Housewives...
My back. I threw it out.
Jeez, are you crying?
Just a little.
Edie got an
unexpected visitor.
Remember
my little boy?
I didn't know your son
was coming for a visit.
His father just dumped
him here for four weeks.
Gaby became the object
of victor's desire.
Have you not noticed?
I'm a catch.
I have noticed, and
I'm throwing you back.
And as Mike struggled
to recall his past,
Ian's jealousy
spurred him to action.
Will you be my wife?
Yes!
God, I'm so nervous.
Don't be.
They're going to adore
you as much as I do.
Oh, thanks.
I needed to hear to that.
Darling... thorns.
I'm so sorry.
If there was one thing Ian
Hainsworth was sure of,
it was that his love for Susan
Mayer was indestructible.
He knew this because
it had been tested again...
And again...
And again.
Still, Ian had found a way
to forgive Susan her...
occasional lack of grace.
Here they come.
The question now
on his mind was,
Would his parents be
able to do the same?
Father.
My dear boy.
This is my fiance Susan.
These are my parents,
Graham and Dahlia.
Delighted.
You weren't exaggerating.
She's a vision, Ian.
It's so great to finally
meet both of you.
Oh, this is for you.
Be careful, mother!
Thorns.
Ian, I know how
to hold a rose.
Yes, of course.
I just didn't want Susan to...
You're right. Sorry.
Anyone hungry?
Yes.
So one puts the meat
atop the burning coals.
How wonderfully primal.
Yes, I'll feel like some gloriously
rough-hewn cowgirl enjoying her...
Uh, what's the word?
"Vittles"?
No, that can't be right.
No, it is. It's vittles.
So, can I get you
something to drink?
I'd adore just
a thimble of gin.
Oh, no, you stay, darling.
I can manage.
Well, it seems to be
going rather well...
Touch wood.
Were you worried?
Oh, you know, introducing one's fiance
to one's parents is always a bit fraught.
Oh, well, you don't
have to tell me.
The first time I met Dahlia's parents
was a complete disaster.
We were at tea,
and there was this
plate of small cakes.
And as I offered one to her mother,
I tipped the plate, and plop!
A scone fell right into
her ladyship's teacup.
Earl grey everywhere!
On the cloth,
her mother's skirt...
You must have
been mortified.
I was. It was an
absolute debacle.
Um, guys?
Don't worry.
She's all right.
Yes, Ian hainsworth knew his love
for Susan was indestructible.
Unfortunately
for his mother,
chiffon was not.

In every housewife's closet,
there's a treasured
article of clothing
that she refuses
to part with.
It might be an old
cheerleader uniform
that symbolizes her youth.
Or the last bikini she wore
before she had children.
Or a pair of expensive pants
she prays will
come back in style.
But for Gabrielle Solis,
every piece of clothing
was a treasure.
Carefully selected,
beautifully maintained,
and utterly...
irreplaceable.
I can't believe you
bought another bustier.
I know.
I should never shop for
lingerie when I'm horny.
It's like buying groceries
when you're hungry.
In a slump, huh?
How long's it been?
About three weeks,
and I am dying.
You know, I'm this close
to seducing my gardener.
Been there,
done that.
Mmm, that scrumptious
teenager of yours.
Hey, do you think...
He's married.
Damn.
How about that Victor Lang?
Have you two...
No. God, no.
As a matter of fact, I think I'm
dumping him after dinner tonight.
Why?
He's rich. He's gorgeous.
He's probably gonna be mayor.
I mean, what more
do you want?
I don't know.
He's just too arrogant.
He acts like I'm some
trophy he's already won.
It's infuriating.
Yeah, that's awful.
Can I do him?
Oh, stop it.
You cannot be
that hard up.
Did I mention
my gardener's 62?
What the hell is this?
Oh, my God!
No!
Hey, hey, hey!
Hey, hey, hey!
Honey?
Where's your uniform?
Oh, crap. I left it
at home again.
Yeah, um,
I figured you would...
again.
That's why...
I pulled an extra
one from the back.
Thanks.
Are you sure it's the right...
Yep, your size.
Listen...
I was thinking,
wouldn't it be better if
the staff wore a uniform,
and you and I wore
regular clothes?
That way it's like,
"Hi. Welcome to Scavo's.
We're the Scavos. "
Yeah, but I like
wearing the uniform,
and when you don't,
It looks like we
all work for you.
Oh, good point.
Okay, here's another
good point: I hate orange.
Since when?
Since always.
You know my closet.
Surely you've noticed
I don't own anything orange.
No, I hadn't really...
Orange says, "Beware.
Something bad's gonna happen. "
That's why they use it for life vests
and traffic cones and convicts.
Also, it washes me
out completely.
You're wearing
the uniform.
Are you speaking as my
husband or as my boss?
Definitely your boss.
Your husband...
Too damn scared of you.
As well he should be.
As Edie walked home,
all she could think of was
her nonexistent love life...
Pass it to me, Carlos!
And how much she wanted
back in the game.
It was just then
she saw someone she
might like to play with.
Hi!
Hey.
Did you see that, Edie?
Kid's looking good, huh?
Looking real good.
Can we play another game?
No, it's lunchtime.
You go wash up.
Bye, Carlos.
Bye.
Oh, you have been so
great with Travers.
Let me take you
out for steak tonight.
You don't have
to pay me back.
I'm having more
fun than he is.
Well, then...
We'll just have to arrange
for another playdate.
Anytime.
Look who's back.
Yes. Let's try this
again, shall we?
Dahlia, I am so
sorry about the...
Please,
not another word.
Chiffon at a barbecue?
I was asking to
be immolated.
A drink with dinner, mother?
Oh, God, yes.
Oh, not that chair.
That's the wobbler.
I'm saving up
for a new set.
Here, sit here.
Ian tells us you have
a young daughter.
Won't she be
joining us?
Julie? No, she's at her
father's this weekend.
Is something wrong?
It's just that Ian told us that your
husband had been gone for years.
We assumed you
were a widow.
No, Karl's alive
and kicking, sadly.
So you're a... divorce?
What happened?
Did he beat you?
No. Of course not.
She had ample
grounds, mother.
Karl was a shameless
womanizer.
So it was just adultery.
Just adultery?
To my way of thinking,
men are,
by nature, weak.
I think Gaham will
back me up on that.
Really, dahlia.
If you want your
marriage to last...
When your husband strays,
you extract some
suitable penance...
and get on with it.
Punish the sin,
but love the sinner.
Yeah, well, with Karl,
I was more,
"Divorce the ass and
seize the assets. "
So you better watch out.
Betrayal makes
me vengeful.
Well, that's good to know.
Yes, it certainly is.
Apparently, the water heater
in the attic had burst.
Everything is ruined.
My clothes, my shoes, dresses.
Why are you smiling?
Well, we have
different perspectives.
You see ruined clothes,
and I see a woman who could
suddenly use a rich boyfriend.
You will never
be my boyfriend.
Gaby, how much longer are you gonna
pretend you're not crazy about me?
Not much longer.
This is our last date.
Didn't you say it was our
last date on our last date?
I mean it this time.
Yeah? Well, do me a favor,
mean it next time.
I'm getting an award
tomorrow at the rotary club.
Boring.
Come on, I want my date to be the
most beautiful woman in the room.
Is that supposed
to flatter me?
Only if you've never seen
the women of the rotary club.
Oh, shut up and
get me a sweater.
Have you even noticed
how cold I am?
Noticed?
It's made my
whole evening.
Sweater, now.
How about a nice
cashmere cardigan?
Oh, my God!
What?
Look at this!
There's Lacroix and Ungaro
and Vintage Gaultier.
Yeah, I don't really know
much about fashion.
Shh! They can hear you.
Oh, my God! There's
another rack back here!
This all your
ex-wife's stuff?
Yeah.
She's storing it here until
her new house is ready.
Oh, my God!
She wears my size!
It's amazing.
Nobody wears my size.
Well, I guess
I have a type.
And normally that
would creep me out,
except it means that I can borrow this
one-of-a-kind Undari for our date!
Heel, girl.
This belongs to my ex.
So?
I don't think she'd appreciate me
loaning her clothes to my girlfriend.
Okay, "a,"
I'm not your girlfriend,
And "b," she's not gonna
find out unless you tell her.
Come on!
A dress this gorgeous
is meant to be seen.
Every day it hangs in the closet,
an angel loses its wings.
That's very cute,
but the answer's still no.
Come on. Let's go.
Gaby.
I just wanted a moment
to say good-bye.
So in the next scene, the guy
wakes up, and the girl,
Julia Roberts, Sandra
Bullock, one of those,
is standing there holding
a tray of pancakes.
What happens then?
I keep telling you,
I don't remember.
What's the difference?
It's just some stupid
movie I saw.
Yet every time you remember it,
you feel sad or upset.
I think something happened
at that movie or just afterwards.
Who did you see it with?
Well, it's obviously
some chick flick...
So probably Susan.
Well, why not
ask her about it?
Maybe she can tell you what happened.
No. No, I don't
want to bother her.
She just got engaged.
Mike, this therapy isn't just about
recovering your memories.
It's about you
getting closure.
Now the emotions you're feeling won't be
resolved until you know whathey're about.
I don't know.
Come on.
Talk to Susan.
What could it hurt?
That's awesome.
I love model airplanes.
So you'll help me put it together?
Sure.
I'll see you tomorrow
after school.
Can you come
at 7:00 instead?
Why so late?
Mom says I can't play till
I finish my homework.
Bye.
He's coming.
So can I stay up and
watch my show now?
You can stay up as late
as you want, champ.
Tomorrow,
you are going to
have an early night.
Your father's been
up there 20 minutes.
Are you sure he's okay?
He's fine.
He always lies
down after dinner.
He says it helps his digestion.
Relax. It's going very well.
I set your mother on fire.
And you've been relentlessly
charming ever since.
Trust me, when she looks back at tonight,
she won't even remember the fire.
But she may
remember this.
Oh, my God! I'm so sorry!
Are you all right?
Yes, I'm perfectly fine.
At least this blouse made
it through dinner.
Let me get
you a towel.
Hello!
I hope you
don't mind.
Dahlia has a birthday
coming up,
and I saw this hanging
there, and I thought,
"a robe!
Well, there's a notion. "
So I just tried it on...
To get a sense
of the drape.
Were you also thinking
of getting her a lace bra?
Oh, dear God!
Please don't mentionhis
to any of my family.
Just take the robe off.
And whatever you
have on underneath...
consider that yours.
Be reasonable, dear.
I'm only trying to protect you.
From Susan?
Well, she doesn't care
about my money.
She's never asked
me for a cent.
Your logic is as wobbly
as the dining room chairs
she can't afford to replace.
I love Susan, and I won't
ask her to do this.
Oh, hello. Mother's fine.
I found her a sweater.
So, uh, what won't
you ask me?
Nothing.
I was wondering if you'd object
to signing a document
that says should you
and Ian part ways,
you'll accept a cash settlement and not
go after the money he inherits from us.
You mean a prenup?
Please try to understand.
Our country estate has been
in our family for generations.
We want it preserved for the
children we hope Ian will have,
not lost in some
pricey divorce.
Well, who's getting divorced?
I'm in this for keeps.
I'm sure you said the same
to your first husband
before you bolted with
all you could carry.
Mother, Susan is not
signing anything.
Fine.
Then we'll leave it
all to your brother.
Oh, do you think Nigel's
going to give you a grandson?
He's an alcoholic homosexual.
With a castle at stake,
he can learn a new skill.
Okay, stop this.
We invited you here to
celebrate our engagement.
Now I'm divorced,
and Ian's disinherited?
Hello.
Have I missed anything?
We'll be going soon.
Please, don't be offended.
All of us go into
marriage convinced
that everything
will be perfect.
God knows I did.
And then one day, I found a bill
for some expensive lingerie.
Bustiers, peignoirs.
None of it in my size.
Certainly opened my eyes.
But I'm not like my father.
Trust him, he's not.
I'm sorry, Ian.
Hey, guys.
Hey, Mrs. Scavo.
I'm sorry. We were just
taking a quick break.
We'll get back to work.
No. No, don't be silly.
Who am I, Tom?
I'm one of you guys.
Sit down.
Hey...
You know what
we could use?
A good old-fashioned
bitch session,
get some stuff
off our chests.
So what's bugging you guys?
Okay, I'll go first.
How do we feel
about these uniforms?
A little... "eh"?
They're okay.
But, hey, why do we
have to pool our tips?
Why can't we just
keep what we earn?
Good point, good point.
But right now we're talking
about these ugly-ass uniforms.
You know what bugs me?
No health benefits.
I'm kind of worried about
this mole that I found...
Focus, people!
The subject is shirts.
It's killing morale.
I kinda like 'em.
Really, Kim?
'Cause...
I heard one of your customers say
that when Halloween comes around,
we should stick a candle
in your mouth.
See? Morale.
You guys need to stand
up for yourselves.
It's your right-
No, it's your obligation to go to
management and demand new shirts.
And if management doesn't like it,
you tell him he can go screw!
Okay, okay.
Break's over, people.
I'm gonna go find
Tom and talk.
Oh! Good.
I can't believe you tried
to undermine me like this.
Well, you gave
me no choice.
It's just a uniform.
Why can't you wear it?
Because I need
to win one, Tom.
What?
You keep ordering me around
and disagreeing with me
and ovruling me,
and I'm sick of it.
We have to do things my way
at least every once in a while.
This was the
deal, Lynette.
You agreed.
I'm in charge here.
You're in charge at home.
Except we're never home.
We live here.
Our marriage
happens here.
Okay, you know what?
We can't talk about this now.
We open in ten minutes.
Maybe later we can...
Later I'll be asleep,
and then I will be back here
before you wake up.
We gotta deal
with this now.
Okay, all right...
We're gonna deal
with this now.
I'm gonna get ready
for the dinner rush,
And you're gonna wear
the damn uniform.
No.
What?
I'm going home.
You're walking
out on me?
I told you orange meant something
bad was gonna happen.
Hi. Remember me?
I had dinner here
the other night.
Anyway, I was driving through
your neighborhood after having,
like, three iced teas, and I really
have to go to the bathroom.
Do you mind?
You and I are gonna
be so happy together.
I feel 10 pounds lighter.
Thank you.
Hey, you got a minute?
I need your help
with something.
I should probably
get these inside.
Please, I...
I need to ask you
about a movie.
And so the last
part I remember,
the girl is putting these raw
pancakes in front of him,
and then something
else funny happened.
I don't remember.
It was just a stupid chick flick.
Mike, it wasn't a movie.
That was us.
What?
Yeah.
That was the first night
that we spent together.
I wanted to surprise you.
With raw pancakes?
They weren't all raw.
I was trying to spell "Mike,"
and the "m" was goopy,
but the "ike" was delicious.
You loved it.
I did, huh?
Actually, no,
it was gross.
But you were
really sweet.
You just gave me a lot of
kisses and said not to worry,
I'd get a lot of chances
to make you pancakes 'cause...
'Cause I was planning on
spending the rest of...
my mornings with you.
You remember.
Yeah.
I should go 'cause
Ian's parents are here.
It's nice to see you.
Thank you
both for coming.
You know, I know I've said it ten
times, but you look fantastic.
And my offer still stands.
You do not have to
pay for my dress.
Come on. You only needed
it for my luncheon,
and it looks like
it cost a bundle.
Trust me, it was a steal.
I'm gonna go powder my nose,
and then you can start showing me off.
Heads-up. I just
saw your ex-wife.
What is she doing here?
Some friend of hers is
getting a plaque, too.
You want to duck out
after your speech?
Are you kidding?
I can't wait till she gets
a good, long look at Gaby.
Hey.
Hello.
I love your dress.
Thanks.
It's one-of-a-kind, isn't it?
Yeah, couture.
Undari?
Wow, good eye.
Well, I do have
an unfair advantage.
I bought it.
So you're...
Well, first, let me just say
you have amazing taste.
If we had met in any other context,
we would so get along.
I left those clothes with Victor
so he could store them,
not loan them
to his sluts.
Okay, you're mad, so I'm just gonna
blow right by that slut crack.
I want my dress back now.
Okay, let's be reasonable.
You can't wear two
dresses to one lunch.
It's not like I have
a spare in the car.
Not my problem.
Give me back the dress.
Go ahead.
Yell all you want.
You can't force me
to take off this dress.
This is pepper spray.
In three seconds,
your eyeballs will be on fire.
Could you help me
with the clasp?
Hello, Samantha.
I heard you were here...
Isn't that Gaby's dress?
Gaby? You in there?
Hey, Victor.
You're probably wondering
why I've been in here so long.
Funny story.
I ran into your ex-wife.
Yeah, she brought
me up to speed.
Okay, it's time
for bed, Travers.
But I wanna show
Carlos my new turtle.
Oh. Right.
I'm tired.
That's okay, buddy.
I gotta get going anyway.
Hey, you haven't even
finished your wine.
Sorry, early day tomorrow.
Come on, kiddo.
I'll tuck you in.
Sleep tight, Travers.
Oh, no! I'm such a klutz.
I think I broke it.
Nah, it's just a flap.
I can fix that.
Uh, Edie?
Yeah?
I can't see what
I'm doing here.
I'm sorry.
Maybe I should watch
so that if it breaks
again, I can fix it.
Okay, um, so this hinge needs
to go in at this angle...
so that the flap works.
See?
God, you're so mechanical.
Edie, what are you doing?
Learning about flaps.
Nah, I think you're
coming on to me.
Maybe.
Okay, Edie, no.
Come on.
We're close friends,
and I don't want to ruin that.
We're not that close.
Let's just do it and
see where it goes.
Okay, you know what?
It wouldn't go anywhere.
Why not?
'Cause I'm looking for a girl
who wants to settle down
and be in a serious relationship,
and you're not that type.
Oh? What type am I?
You're... the fun type,
who likes to dress sexy and go
out and meet new people,
and then go out the next
night and meet another...
new people.
You think I'm promiscuous?
I'm just saying, for
a house on a cul-de-sac,
this place sees
a lot of traffic.
Just because I'm popular doesn't
mean that I'm incapable
of a lasting commitment.
Look, you can't even
commit to your kid.
He's here for a month, and you
keep dumping him on neighbors
so you can go shopping.
That is, when you're not
using him for sex bait.
Get out of my house.
Tom, it's me again.
You should've been
home 30 minutes ago.
I know. You're still mad.
I am, to so why don't you come home
and we can be mad together?
See you soon.
So what kind of orange is this shirt?
Like a salmon or a coral?
Oh, cheese doodle.
Exactly, and I'm supposed to
wear that every damn day.
Oh, please.
It's not that bad.
I once worked at this
fish-and-chip place.
I had to wear an eye patch and
a stuffed parrot on my shoulder.
"Would you like to
hear arrr specials?"
Why dot you just tell Tom
to pick another color?
This isn't about
the shirt anymore.
This is about us
working together.
Every day it's a battle.
It's hurting
our marriage.
You know what?
I'll just tell Tom
I need to step back.
You mean quit?
Yeah. We could hire
a manager or something.
How do you think Tom's
gonna feel about that?
Well, once he decides to
stop hiding, I can ask him.
You know what?
I'm tired of waiting.
I'm gonna go down there
and I'm gonna talk to him.
See you guys later.
So I guess this means we're
babysitting the kids, huh?
Guess so.
I'm an idiot.
Would you guys mind...
We got it. Just go.
Tom!
Come on!
I know you're still here.
You realize
what time it is?
I know! You're mad.
But you just...
you can't avoid
me all night.
Oh, my God!
Oh, Tom. Tommy...
Okay, okay,
you're breathing.
That's good.
That's good.
Hello? Hi. There's something
wrong with my husband.
I don't know.
He's unconscious.
357 Hawthorne place.
Okay, could you
please hurry?
Thank you. Yes.
Listen to me.
I forbid you to die.
If you leave me
with a mortgage and
a restaurant and five kids,
I swear I will track you
into the deepest pit of
hell and make you pay.
Do you hear me?
Come on, baby...
Oh, please.
So that's it?
He threw out his back?
Oh, thank God.
I'm guessing he passed
out from the pain.
But I wanna be clear.
A ruptured disc
is very serious.
He'll need surgery.
It'll be a while before
he's back on his feet.
How much of a while?
Three months.
Three months?
Even then,
he'll need to go easy.
What sort of work
does he do?
We run a restaurant.
He shouldn't go back
for four or five months.
Restaurant work
is very stressful.
Yeah, it is.
What's that?
It's the prenup my
parents want you to sign.
And you brought
it to bed?
Okay, romance tip
number one...
Sorry. I just can't get
that off my mind.
I keep thinking,
why all this ungodly fuss?
Susan's not in this for
money and heirlooms.
Thank you. I don't want
your family's stuff.
What am I gonna do
with half a castle?
Exactly.
So why not just sign it?
Huh?
Well, I mean,
looking at it rationally,
what's the difference between making
the promise you just made to me
and making the same
promise on paper?
Well, the difference is huge.
I mean, one way you're
trusting me, and...
And the other way, you're
trying to make it official.
But isn't that what marriage is,
making your love official?
Ian, do you really want to start our
life together making me feel like...
I'm on probation?
You know that I trust you.
This isn't about my fears.
It's about my parents.
Really?
I think it's about
someone else.
He just wanted me to help
him remember something.
Who?
Mike.
I saw you watching us.
We were just talking.
I never thought
anything else.
Okay, I'll sign it.
At least read it first.
I don't need to.
I trust you.
Oh. Hi, Mike.
So tell me. I've been
dying to know.
Did you talk to Susan?
Could she remember
what the movie was?
Actually... no.
Ah, well, hang in there.
We'll figure it out.
It's just a matter of time before
everything starts coming back.
Here, have a seat.
Listen, you've been really
helpful the last few months,
but I think I'm done here.
Mike, I know this can be
a frustrating process.
But if you give up now,
there are so many memories
that could be lost to you.
Yeah, I'm okay with that.
Oh, my God.
How many did you take?
Sorry. I wanted options.
Stop judging me.
I was hopped up on couture.
Hey, you know, it's not funny.
Samantha called her lawyer.
What? Over a dress?
God, what a bitch.
Don't call her that.
She threatened me with mace
and then slugged you.
Now you're on her side?
Gaby, I didn't marry an angry
woman. I just divorced one.
What happened? Did you have
some little mistress on the side?
Worse.
I treated her like
she was the mistress.
I set her up in a nice house,
I gave her an allowance.
And then I came
and went as I pleased.
She was always there
when I needed her, but
if she needed me, well...
And if she wasn't happy,
she could always go out
and buy a nice new dress.
You saw the closet, so you
know just how happy she was.
What?
I've known you
for two weeks,
and this is the first glimpse
of a guy I could actually like.
A clueless, emotionally
stunted workaholic?
A guy who can admit
he screwed up,
One who's not trying to impress
me every second of the day
with how perfect
and charming he is.
I wouldn't mind seeing
more of that guy.
Well, his schedule's wide open.
How about dinner
tomorrow night?
I'd love to.
Although what am
I gonna wear now?
Doesn't matter.
'Cause I'm just gonna
talk you out of it.
Look who's back,
Mr. Cocky.
He never leaves for long,
does he, that guy?
Are there any points you'd like
to discuss before you sign?
I'd like you to say,
"We don't need this.
We trust you. "
But you don't,
so I'll sign it.
And once I do, I am
going to earn your trust
by being a good
wife to Ian.
Well, we're sure
you will be.
Sign all three
copies, please.
I mean it. I am going to be loving
and faithful and above all, honest.
There'll be no
secrets with Ian.
I'll tell him everything.
Well, we applaud your candor.
What I'm trying to say is,
there'll be no topic
that I need to...
skirt,
No issue that I won't...
address.
I won't conceal
my true thoughts
under garments of secrecy.
Good for you.
Now if you'll just sign...
For God sakes, Dahlia.
Anyone can see she's
not a fortune hunter.
Graham, what are you doing?
She is willing to sign.
Which proves she
can be trusted.
I'm sure you'll be
a good wife to Ian.
You can count on it.
Thanks for the flowers.
You're welcome.
Come on.
You know,
about Travers...
You can see
him if you want.
He misses you.
I miss him, too.
Oh, and just so you know,
he's at a sleepover,
so I didn't leave
him alone with
a six-pack and
some matches.
Look, Edie, um...
What I said about you
the other day was...
Dead-on.
You nailed me, Carlos.
Maybe not the way that
I wanted you to, but still...
But I had no right
to judge you.
Besides, the guys,
the clothes, the partying.
That's you.
I mean, that's the
Edie that we love.
Well, I'm glad you love her,
because I'm getting pretty tired of her.
Come on...
I'm a 40-year-old party girl.
Do you think that I don't know
that my days are numbered?
I don't know what you
want me to say here.
Don't say anything.
Just...
Stop seeing the person
that I've been and
start seeing the
person I could be.
Look at me,
not the Edie that
I show the world.
In fact...
let's lose her.
Forget the blouse that
she wears because
she knows it shows
off her cleavage.
Edie, what are you doing?
And the skirt
that's so short
because she knows
that guys love long legs.
And the heels.
The ones that make
her legs look even longer.
Edie, please.
Forget the bra
that holds her breasts
a little higher
than they are on
their own these days.
And the panties.
The ones that hide the
scar from my c-section.
This is it.
Hi, Carlos.
I'm Edie.
I might not be the woman that
you thought I was under all of that...
But I'm real,
and I'm here.
And I'm asking
for a chance.
Hey, Andrew.
Ah, thanks.
He's gonna be okay.
No. No, absolutely not.
We will open
tonight as usual.
Hey, it's gonna
be fine, Andrew.
I will take care of it.
It's my job now.
Okay. See you soon. Bye.
In every housewife's closet,
there's an article of clothing
that tells you more
about its owner
than she would
want you to know.
It might be a shirt
that she despises
but wears without complaint.
Perhaps it's some lingerie,
she knows isn't hers,
but refuses to discuss...
Or a dress she once loved,
that she can no
longer bear to look at.
Yes, you can learn
a lot about women
from what they
choose to wear.
You can learn even more
by what they choose to take off,
and who they take it off for.
Previously on Desperate Housewives...
Mike's therapy hit a snag.
Keep telling you, I don't remember.
Something happened at that movie.
Who did you see it with?
Probably Susan.
Why not ask her about it?
Mike, it wasn't a movie that was us.
What?
That was the first night that
we spent together.
I saw you watching us.
We were just talking.
Gaby saw another side of Victor.
I didn't marry an angry woman.
I just divorced one.
And I set her up in a nice house,
And I gave her an allowance, and
then I came and went as I pleased.
I've known you for two weeks,
And this is the first glimpse of
a guy could actually like.
Tom's back put him out of commission.
It'll be a while
before he's back on his feet.
How much of a while?
Three months.
And Edie
bared more her soul for Carlos.
I'm here,
and I'm asking for a chance.
Edie Britt had always thought
of herself as passionate...
aggressively...
relentlessly...
violently passionate.
Carlos solis had always thought
of himself as passionate
romantically...
spontaneously...
constantly passionate.
So it was natural for Eddie and Carlos
to assume that if they ever had sex,
it would be amazing.
And, in fact, it was...
amazingly...
bad.
Morning.
Morning.
So, uh, last night...
yeah, I know.
Super wow.
Is that clock right?
Oh, man, I gotta get work.
Yeah! I gotta get home.
So, uh...
oh, we should do this again.
Oh, definitely.
Yeah, this week doesn't seem
to be that great.
Maybe...
Next week, I'm swamped.
Well, we'll figure something out.
It was at that moment Eddie and Carlos
had the exact same thought...
thank you.
Thank you.
they would definitely
be having sex again...
just not.
with each other.

Season 03 Episode 18
"Liaisons"
It's so easy to spot the lonely ones.
It wasn't the first time...
they're the peop who tell stories
to their plants...
I kind of like him.
and whisper secrets to their pets
...ask him to be
my boyfriend if he wants.
and have arguments with their tv.
Get him off the court!
He was runing like his feet
are made out of lead!
and the loneliest of all are the ones
who talk to people...
do you know what I think, Gilbert?
people who are no longer there.
Phone's gonna ring any second.
It's gonna be Lynette begging me
to come over early.
Did I tell you that Tom had surgery
on his back last week?
That idiot's flat on his ass while
Lynette brings home the bacon again.
Eh, I shouldn't judge.
Plenty of people didn't get
what I saw in you.
I won't name names...
my sister gayle.
I always told her that beneath
all the name-Calling
And the dish-Throwing we really
loved each other.
Betcha 50 bucks it's Lynette.
Hello?
You lose, Gilbert.
What's up?
I have to get to the restaurant early.
Is there any you could come over
and get the kids off to school?
Why am I seeing pajamas?
Get dressed!
Yeah, they are ready to go.
So what you say?
Oh, great! Thanks.
I owe you big-Time.
All right, I am heading out of here.
Wish me luck.
Re interviews this morning?
Yeah, but don't worry.
I am gonna find you
the assistant manager of your dreams.
Are you sure? Because the last
ten rsums you showed me...
yeah, I know, I know.
Bottom of the barrel,
convicts and losers.
You were clear
about that last night.
And make sure that they really know
how to wrangle the employees.
Like kim... she never
buses her tables.
I'm the one that told you that.
Oh. Yeah, right.
Hey, honey, I had an idea
about he specials for today.
I was thinking goat cheese
and mushrooms.
Oh, for God sake, Tom!
I'm gonna be late for this interview.
I really should go.
Honey, I'm sorry.
I know I am driving you crazy.
No.
It's just that I'm feeling so guilty
laying here, totally worthless,
While you run the restaurant
and the house.
It's okay. I am gonna find a way
to make this all work,
And you just get better.
Mrs. Mccluskey.
Perfect timing.
Hey, make sure you have
your cell phone with you.
Then while you're interviewing,
I'll call, you can conference me in.
That is a great idea!
Hi!
Hi.
At some point, Tom's gonna
ask you to look for this.
You will not find it.
Great.
Love you!
Here's your beer.
Oh! Good job, chipmunk.
No foam this time.
I tipped the glass just
like you told me to.
I think someone's read to salt
his first margarita glass.
Mommy,do you have trouble
going to sleep?
Why do you ask?
'Cause I heard Carlos
say you were bad in bed.
What?!
Why'd he say that?
Do you have nightmares?
Okay, sweetie,
I need you to focus.
What exactly did Carlos say,
and who did he say it to?
I went to get my soccer
ball from his yard.
He was on the one
talking to someone.
So what does "bad in bed" mean?
Well, it means that
you're not good at making...
your bed.
And mommy doesn't like people saying
she can't make a bed because...
trust me, nobody makes a bed
as good as your mommy.
If you want, I can tell people
you're good in bed.
That's fine, sweetie.
Uh, if you want to help mommy,
just, um...
top off her breakfast.
Susan, I'm, uh, by the orange stand.
Where are you?
The cheese stand?
No, I don't mind you going back
for free samples.
But if you like it so much,
why don't you just buy some?
Yeah, of course, you're right.
It always tastes better
when it's free.
Okay, then please hurry.
Hello.
Boy, you're everywhere these days
Excuse me?
Well, yesterday, Susan and I
ran into you at the post office.
Last week, the movies.
One might think you're following us.
Trust me,one better things to do
than follow you around.
And yet here you are... again.
Ian, fairview's a small town.
You want distance?
Move to the city.
You've been awfully quiet
since we left the market.
Is everything okay?
Well, since you ask, I'm having
some problems at work.
Really?
Yes, we're in the midst of
some corporate restructuring.
I'm gonna have to spend
more time in london.
And I was thinking,
maybe you and I should just...
relocate.
To london?
Permanently?
I know it's sudden, but...
Yeah, it's sudden.
My whole life is here.
I mean, my friends.
You know, julie is still in school...
oh, my God.
Are you okay?
I'm fine. I'm fine.
I can feel the car sinking.
We're gonna
have to get to shore.
How deep do you think
this water is?
Deep enough.
Come on! Let's move!
I can't swim.
What?!
You said you played water polo!
I said polo with horses!
How can you not know how to swim?
Didn't you go to summer camp?
I stayed in the canoe.
Let it go!
Okay, don't panic.
Just grab onto my neck,
and I'll swim for the both of us.
I'm twice your size.
We might drown.
Let's just stay here
and think of something else.
If you stay here,
you'll definitely drown.
You see how my plan is better?
Look, there's somebody
on the shore!
It's Mike! He's here.
Of course he is.
I can walk from here!
Sorry. You were just
gripping me so tight.
Oh, my God.
Mike, you sad our lives.
And our cheese!
Ian, can you believe it?
Mike saved our cheese!
Yes, he's...
he's quite the hero.
Good thing
I was following you.
Arnie, thanks for coming in.
We will definitely
keep you in mind.
Come on.
What was wrong
with that guy?
He kept asking what we do
with the food people don't eat.
All right,
so he's a fat loser. I mean,
Who'd you expect
to get for $8.50 an hour?
Well, that's what we pay you,
and you seem happy enough.
That's because I'm doing
the beer delivery guy.
My fault for asking.
Rick Coletti?
That's me.
Great.
Come on over.
Your application?
One second
cheese calzone
That's been bothering me. Sorry.
No. It's great you can spell.
You are now officially the front-Runner.
Yeah, my, uh, grandma
came over from naples.
I've been making calzones
since before you were born.
How old do you think I am?
30? 31?
Not afraid to shamelessly ass kiss.
You are doing very well.
Great you wanna skip ahead
to the part where you hire me?
Well, I should probably take a look
at your application first.
Okay, don't be afraid if you
don't have a ton of experience.
I realize for what we're paying,
we're not exactly gonna get a...
you were a sous-Chef
at cucina?
That's a five-Star restaurant.
Actually four.
Which is four more thane have
Yeah, but this place his
character and charm, and...
a beautiful owner.
But seriously,
Why would a four-Star chef
wanna slum at a pizza joint?
Mrs. Mccskey!
I'm right here!
Keep your shirt on.
I need another pill. And please,
tell the kids to turn down the tv.
I yell, they turn it down. I walk away,
they turn it up. Vicious circle.
Surely you can control
five little kids.
Can I beat 'em?
No.
Then my hands are tied.
Hi! I'm home! And I've got good news.
I found a new manager.
That's terrific.
Yeah, his name is Rick Coletti,
And he was a sous-Chef at cucina.
Cucina? Why does he wanna
work at our place?
Yeah, I had that exact same thought.
And to be honest, he has a history.
History?
You know how stressful it is working
in a four-Star restaurant,
And he, like many chefs, started
using cocaine just to stay ahead...
no way.
Clean for almost a year.
We're not the betty ford clinic!
No, I know, but I've got a really good
feeling about this guy,
And all he wants is a fresh start.
I am not gonna hire a junkie
who's gonna turn around and...
and then hock our jukebox
just to feed his habit.
Here, go find somebody else.
I can't find somebody else.
I've interviewed 50 guys,
And this junkie happens to be
the best of the bunch.
Seriously, Tom, I don't know
how much longer I...
please, can we just talk about this
later? I'm in a lot of pain right now.
I'm sorry.
Please, just.
Do what I am asking.
Fine.
I'll, uh, keep looking.
I had such a good time tonight.
Who knew you could dance?
It's of my many talents.
I'll tell you what. You invite me in for
a drink, I'll show you another one.
Not tonight, thanks.
So you would tango with a mad
and then not he sex with him?
You know that's actually
against the law in argentina.
Come on. We both know
it's gonna happen eventually.
And every time you say that,
"eventually" gets a little further away.
Stop begging, or I'm not going
to your rally tomorrow.
Fine. I can be patient.
As far as I'm concerned,
the chase is half the fun.
Half the fun?
Oh, honey, if I ever do say yes...
you're gonna adjust
that percentage way down.
You can't possibly
be eating more cheese.
What, you've never heard
of a midnight snack?
Unless you can think of something else
that I can nibble on.
Slide over, you cheddar-Breath tease.
Oh, what's that?
It's a thank you gift for Mike.
Correct me if I'm wrong, but didn't
we already thank him at the shore,
And again when
he dropped us off at home?
I don't think you can really thank
somebody too many times
For saving your life.
I wish you'd stop saying that.
Saying what?
That he saved my life.
I'm fairly certain I could've
survived without his help.
And if anyone did
any lifesaving, it was me.
You?
Yes.
If hadn't warned you about the deer,
It would've gone straight
through the windshield,
And you would've ended up with
an antler through your brain.
Okay, that's a good point.
Thank you.
But we were
in a bit of a jam there, and...
I don't think you should be embarrassed
for needing a little help.
I'm not embarrassed, and I don't
feel emasculated, either.
Emasculated?
Who said emasculated?
And why are you
not kissing me now?
I'm ready when you are.
I guess we're gonna
cut right to the...
don't worry.
Happens to everybody.
Maybe it would help to talk about it.
No.
I don't want to talk about it.
All right.
We won't talk about it.
Want some cheese?
Hey, how are you?
I'm good.
Well, you might not think so,
but... I am good.
Where in the hell do you get off
telling people that I am bad in bed?!
I never said that!
Travers heard you on the phone!
Okay, I'm sorry. I was talking
to my cousin in tucson,
And we always trade bad date stories.
And to think that I went out of
my way to spare your feelings?
What's that supposed to mean?
You think you were bored?
I've had more thrills
leaning up against my dryer.
Then what was all that moaning?
I was in pain!
You were smashing my breasts!
Oh, come on!
You hunkered down on top of me like
you were hiding from the border patrol.
I was tired. You just laid there
while I did all the work.
When we were done, I felt like
I should deflate you.
Well, sex is like tennis
When you play an inferior opponent,
your game suffers.
Are you challenging me
to a rematch?
Maybe.
So you wanna do it again?
If it'll shut you up...
I'll fall on that grenade.
There's gonna be
an explosion. Come on.
I'm prescribing a mild painkiller
for your back,
And I will see you in a week
to remove those stitches.
Great.
So... how'd you folks get
so banged up?
Car accident?
Bad sex.
Really bad.
Thanks.
God, what a disaster.
Oh, I don't know.
Maybe it's for the best.
How so?
We got it out of our system. Now we can
go back to being friends. I mean,
We like hanging out,
and Travers adores you.
Yeah, and I wouldn't wanna ruin that.
Still, it doesn't make any sense.
Oh, I know.
I'm hot. You're hot. On paper,
we should be having great sex.
Well, we could always try again.
Yeah, me neither.
This town is hungry for change...
When Gabrielle solis agreed to attend
Victor Lang's campaign rally,
she was fully prepared to be bored.
I give you the next mayor of Fairview-
But when Victor took the stage,
Gabrielle found herself
strangely enthralled.
Perhaps it was the cheers
that greeted his arrival.
Perhaps it was the confidence he exuded.
Or perhaps it was the effect he had
on the citizens of Fairview.
Whatever the reason,
Gaby decided
not only did Victor Lang
have her vote...
It was time to make
a campaign contribution.
Sorry. Excuse me. Excuse me.
Sure.
Excuse me. Sorry.
I'm afraid mr. Lang has to take
An important meeting
in his limo...
now.
To the radio station, Clyde.
So what's all this about?
Your speech-
I liked it.
Seriously, here?
Now?
Well, you laid out
all your positions.
Don't you want
to get acquainted with mine?
Clyde, could you put up
the partition, please?
Yes, sir. Anything else?
Music. Loud music.
Mrs. Mccluskey,
it has been ten minutes!
Where's my pie?!
I'm unloading the dishwasher.
You'll get your damn pie
when I'm done.
I want my pie now.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, you heard me.
Your being here
isn't charity.
We pay you good money
to help us.
So when I ask you to do
something, I want it done!
Well, here's a surprise
for you...
I quit.
What? What? Why? Why?
What happened?
Five kids are tough enough,
but your husband makes six,
And that's where
I draw the line.
Okay, I know that, uh, Tom
has been a little cranky lately.
No, I'm cranky.
He's insufferable.
I hate to admit this, Lynette,
But every time
that man screams out in pain,
I do a little jig inside.
Look, I'll talk to Tom-
No, my mind's made up.
Wait, wait, wait!
Please don't do this. Please.
I am at the end of my rope.
I wish I could help you, Lynette.
I can see that you're going down,
But I'm just too old to get
dragged down with you.
Oh, it's cold!
Okay, everybody,
go on up to bed.
Parker, you got the baby.
Yeah, that's exactly right.
You know what to do.
Before you speak,
Just know that
ever since mccluskey left,
I've been lying here
Feeling like
the biggest jerk ever.
Tomorrow morning, I am gonna
call her and apologize.
I will fix this.
Well, you might
also want to apologize
To the custor who found
a Lego in her pizza.
Oh, God.
Did the kids do that?
I hope.
Oh, God.
It was so awful tonight.
Oh, honey.
You know what you need?
What?
A seein' to.
Once the kids are asleep,
Slip on that sexy blue thing
And then sneak back down here.
You wanna have sex?
But you're immobile.
Okay, maybe full-On sex
is a little ambitious,
But there's other stuff
that we could do...
but you can't bend at the waist,
And that pretty much
leaves the heavy lifting to me.
Trust me, if you get us
to the finish line,
I will cross it.
Is that why you apologized,
just so I'd... service you?
Honey, I have been trapped
in this bed all day long.
I'm bored. I'm miserable.
Can't you do this
one little thing for me?
I have been doing
everything I can
To keep our heads
above water.
I can't do you, too.
For Gabrielle,
the best part of having sex
with a new man
was seeing how quickly
his affection would turn
to obsession.
No messages.
But when Victor failed to call
the next morning...
No messages.
Or the next afternoon...
No messages.
It was Gabrielle who began obsessing.
Not a peep. 24 hours.
Well, he's busy. Isn't he
debating the mayor tonight?
I don't care! He can find
two lousy minutes for me.
I'm here!
Deal me in.
Sorry, no poker today.
Lynette had to work.
Want a margarita?
Oh, I'd like three,
but I'll start with one.
Ms. Solis?
Sorry to interrupt.
You have any water?
Yeah, in the fridge.
Who is that?
And why don't you put your water
on that lower shelf?
Thank you.
That's Toby. He's fixing my closet.
Has your cocky boyfriend
gotten a load of the help?
Move away om that topic.
We had sex yesterday in his limo.
Ooh, I love limo sex.
Town car or stretch?
Well, stretch, of course.
I'm not a complete slut.
Point is, he hasn't called since.
So... how was the sex?
Fantastic.
As good as with Carlos.
Hmm. That good, huh?
God, I'm such an idiot.
I gave it up way too fast.
Now I've lost all the power.
Oh, come on.
No, I'm serious.
Our mothers had the right idea.
They let men think they were
the only ones who needed sex,
And women just went along as a favor.
Men begged for every crumb,
And we never lost the upper hand.
Yeah, no guy respects
an easy conquest.
I make all my men wait.
It's true. She has a little room
with magazines and an aquarium.
I have so missed our friendship.
I think if you really like this guy,
You should just be honest.
You should tell him
that you feel a little hurt-
Oh, yeah, whining is really
gonna bring him to his knees.
You wanna get this guy
back in line?
You hit him hard, hit him fast.
Is he the jealous type?
Aren't they all?
So what should I do
to make him jealous?
I got all the shelves up.
Anything else?
My opponent thinks
we should combat prostitution
By mounting surveillance cameras
to embarrass the customers.
I call that a blatant violation
of our citizens' privacy.
Mr. Mayor, if you're
so worried about privacy,
Just wear a hat, keep your head
down, and you'll be fine.
Okay, thank you very much, gentlemen.
So let's move on
to our next subject.
You both have said our citizens
pay too much in taxes.
How would you
attract new business
To boost the city's tax base?
Mr. Lang?
I'm sorry, would you, uh...
uh, repeat the question, please?
How would you bring
new business to fairview?
I would, uh...
offer tax exemptions
to, uh, first-Year start-Ups.
And that will...
increase our tax base?
Uh, no. Of course not.
Not at first. But when conjoined with...
my opponent seems
a bit overtaxed himself.
Gentlemen, there's been much talk lately
Regarding our local schools.
What would you do
to improve public education?
Here you go. Sorry for the wait.
Miss! Please?
I will be right there!
Oh, my God! Mrs. Scavo,
I am so sorry.
Don't cry. Just clean.
Miss, if you could just-
I swear, I will be there in one second.
Here you go. Here you go.
Let me guess. This a bad time?
Oh, my God, Rick. I never
got back to you. I am so sorry.
That's okay.
I didn't mind waiting.
So long as it's good news
for me now.
Look, I think you're great,
And we would be lucky
to have you.
It's just, my husband
isn't really comfortable-
With an ex-Drug addict
in his kitchen.
You can drug test me every week.
Anything you want.
I just... I really need this job.
Miss!
Could you excuse me a second?
I'm sorry. I'm sorry
what's up?
I hate my calzone.
Oh? What's wrong with it?
It's just not good,
and I want a new one.
All right, all right.
I will put you order in.
But the kitchen's a little backed up.
Not my problem.
You gave me
a sucky calzone.
I don't care if you have to get
back there and make it yourself!
I can't do this.
It's just...
what is this?
I'll make you a new calzone, sir.
Uh, fresh basil, garlic...
you like sun-Dried tomatoes?
Yeah, sounds good.
All right.
Is she all right?
Yeah. It's her grandma's
calzone recipe.
She takes criticism very personally.
Prep some dough
for a calzone for me,
And, uh, can you get someone
to chop some basil?
Yeah, okay.
Who are you?
I'm Rick.
You-You-
You work here now?
Looks like I do.
Oh, is that new?
I just bought it.
But if you don't like it,
feel free to rip it off me.
Actually, I have this book
proposal to discuss
At an 8:00 a. M. Meeting,
so I-I can't really...
well, that's okay.
You gotta work, you gotta work.
So, um... I was
thinking about London.
Julie's gonna be
applying to college as soon,
And, um, a year abroad
could give her a real boost.
So... let's do it.
Are you serious?
Yes. I wanna spend time
in your world.
I wanna play cricket,
and I wanna eat crumpets,
And I want to use the word...
"ghastly. "
God, Susan, you have no idea
How excited this makes me feel.
My thigh's getting an inkling.
We'll call a realtor
first thing in the morning
And put our houses on the market.
Mine, okay? That way,
we can use it when we visit.
That's what hotels are for, darling.
I don't want sell my house.
Everybody I love is on this street.
What happened?
I'm feeling tired.
You weren't tired a second ago.
I'm not in the mood, all right?
Why not?
You know, I'm not used to being
grilled about my sex drive.
Well, I'm not used to guys bailing on me
In the middle of foreplay.
And by "guys,"
of course you mean Mike.
What?
Oh, I'm sure good old Mike
was ready and able 24/7.
You're not actually...
okay. That's it...
I've had it.
Really,
I can't have this conversation
one more time.
I've done nothing
but prove my love to you
For the last year,
And you cannot shut up
about Mike.
I don't trust the man!
Well, you don't have to trust Mike!
You have to trust me,
and you don't!
That's what going to england's
about, isn't it?
You're just trying
to get me away from Mike.
Well, you know what?
Screw it. I'm not going.
And if you ever bring up
his name again, we're over.
Got it? Over!
Hi.
This is from me and Ian.
An electric juicer.
Yeah, well, you know, you try
to think of a more appropriate
"Thank you for saving my life" gift.
This works fine for me.
Good.
I should go.
You okay?
I'm good.
You sure about that?
Yeah, it's just, um...
you know, Ian and I
had a had a little...
thing.
Hi.
Hi.
Ian, about what I said-
You were right.
You've never given me
reason to doubt you.
I'm an insecure idiot.
I don't deserve you, Susan.
But if you'll please
keep pretending that I do,
I swear I will not utter
a single jealous word
For the rest of our lives together.
Gaby, it's Victor.
What the hell were you thinking?
That little stunt of yours
almost cost me the debate.
It's me again. Okay, I get it.
I forgot to call,
and you were mad.
But still, you-
Hi. I hope you got the flowers.
Again, I am so sorry for not calling-
Gaby, come on. What's it gonna
take for you to forgive me?
I'll do anything you want-
I brought you some flowers...
in case the other
three bouquets get lonely.
Thank you. You can go now.
I don't want to take any more
time out of your busy schedule.
For God sake, Gaby,
How many times
do I have to say I'm sorry?
What I did was thoughtless
and inconsiderate.
Yes, it was.
What you did was flat-Out vicious.
Just trying to get your attention.
By humiliating me in public?
Hey, you hurt me.
If I have to strike back hard
to protect myself...
is that what you think this is?
Combat?
I've been taken for granted before,
And I'm not gonna
let it happen again.
If I'm gonna give myself to you,
you damn well better worship me!
And I will do that...
morning and evening services.
Good.
But you have to stop
treating this relationship
Like it's a boxing match
only one of us can win.
Maybe you haven't noticed,
but I'm in love with you.
So it'd be nice
If you could take the gloves off
and trust me.
You're in love with me?
My campaign-
That's about winning.
This, you and me,
it's about happiness.
And we could both
use a little.
But maybe you need some
more time to think about it.
Look. No gloves.
Travers conked out the moment
his head hit the pillow.
Poor little guy was beat.
Well, he should be.
We covered every inch
of that zoo.
Oh, check this out-
You and Travers
at the monkey house.
Oh, I look squinty.
Delete. Delete.
There's the one the pretzel guy took.
Look at the three of us.
You have to e-Mail
me that one.
Isn't that great?
You know, he thought
that Travers had my eyes.
Seriously?
He totally thought we were a family.
Well, if we were,
We'd be one hell
of a good-Looking one.
Yeah. Nothing better than family.
And this time, I really mean it.
Me, too.
Well you gonna say anyting
To be honest
I've heard a better aplogy.
But I how hard this must
have been for you.
And that makes me happy
So I accept.
Thanks.
That's big of you.
That is big of you to admit
you are a chucklehead.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Did you heard that, Gibert?
He apologized.
I mean I know
he did it just for her sake
But still...
maybe they have a good
marriage after all.
But they will never have what
we had will they gibert.
Not by a long shot.
passion.
It's a four so pont
we still remenber it
long after it's faded away.
A drive so alluring
it can push us to the arm
of unexpected lovers
a sensation so overwhelming
it can knock down walls
we built to protect ours hearts.
A feeling so intense
it re surfaces
even though we try so hard
to keep it buried.
Yes of all emotions
passion is the one
that gives us a reson to live
and an excuse to commit
all sorts of crimes
Previously on Desperate Housewives.
Maybe you haven't noticed,
but I'm in love with you.
Victor caught Gaby by surprise...
Why would a four-star chef wanna slum at a pizza joint?
Lynette took a gamble...
He has a history... using cocaine.
No, no way.
Well, but he's been clean for almost a year.
Mike bet on love...
I win, you leave me and Susan alone.
And lost...
Don't panic.
But still came to Susan's rescue.
You okay?
Yeah.
And Mrs. McCluskey revealed her secret
for a lasting relationship.
It was late on a Tuesday night
when the power went out all over Fairview.
For most of the residents,
it was a minor inconvenience.
But for those with secrets,
the darkness proved quite useful indeed.
Millie Russell was able to
indulge in another night of midnight binging.
Timmy Cooper was able to sneak another peek
at his father's adult magazines.
Marilyn Quinn was able to
steal a few more puffs of her forbidden tobacco.
but these secrets paled compared to the one
a certain old woman was hiding in her basement.
You sit tight, Ida.
I got batteries here.
No, I keep them in the freezer for just such an emergency.
I'll run 'em over to you.
By the way,you wouldn't happen to
have any extra ice laying around, would ya?
No,I've just got some stuff in my freezer
I don't want thawing out anytime soon.
Yes, as a rule,darkness helps us
keep our secrets safely hidden.
Oh, crap!
But every rule...
Karen, what's happened?
Are you okay?...
Has its exceptions.
Desperate Housewives Season 03 Episode 19-
"GOD THAT'S GOOD"-
When the lights went out on Wisteria Lane,
Karen Mccluskey wasn't the only reside left in the dark.
Everyone else felt the pain of going without power as well.
Ow! Damn! Thumbtack!
Susan, please let me help.
No, no, I got it.
Oh, wait.
Here we go.
But it's hardly a long-term solution.
Well, at least it'll keep me
from stabbing myself while I look.
But this is silly.
Why don't we just borrow a flashlight from Mike?
Mike?
He's a plumber. He's bound to have a spare.
Sure, but we can't keep leaning on him for everything.
"Mike, we're drowning. Save us. "
"Mike, it's dark. Give us a flashlight. "
Let's go ask Gaby.
Actually, I wanted to talk to him anyway.
I thought we might ask him over for dinner.
Dinner?
You know,as a as a thank you gesture.
Well, Ian, you've tasted my cooking.
It's not a thank you.
It's revenge.
Well, then I'll cook.
You know, you told me
I should put my jealousy behind me.
I think breaking bread together
would be a great start.
Well, let's not bother him tonight.
You know,
I don't really even need a flashlight.
My eyes have totally adjusted to the dark.
What was that?
Don't walk in the kitchen.
Anyway, where is your sense of romance?
It's a blackout.
You have a defenseless lady.
Getting any ideas?
Well, I-I-I'm starting to, yes.
It's funny.
All that time I wasted worrying Mike
would come between us-
it seems so laughable now, doesn't it?
Kiss me.
Hey, Carlos, we had a blackout.
You need a flashlight?
Carlos, you okay?
Oh, uh, sorry, man.
I thought I heard a thud.
I just, um, bumped into a chair.
I didn't think
that you were coming home till tomorrow.
Nah, fish weren't bitin'.
So, uh...
you got a girl in here?
No.
Why?
Oh,'cause when I came home,
I thought I heard sex noise.
No, that was just me.
Okay.
Night.
Oh, God, that was close.
All this sneaking around is ridiculous!
Mike and I dated for... five minutes.
He's not gonna care.
What if Travers finds out?
Look, I don't want him to be confused,
and until we figure out where this is going,
I just...
think we should keep things on the down low.
Hey, I didn't say we had to stop.
I just said we had to be quiet.
What?
I suppose we should tiptoe around like schoolchildren
so our parents don't catch us doing it?
I feel like I'm 12 again.
I'm just saying,I don't think
that the whole world needs to know our...
12?
Okay,look...
I will find us another place to rendezvous.
But I'm not gonna skulk around forever.
And no one's asking you to.
I respect you too much for that.
if you don't mind...
oh, for God sake...
I'm gonna be right there.
Here you go.
So can you still cook with the power out?
Of course!
Absolutely!
Please, please,tell me we can still make pizza.
No dice.
Some genius installed pizza ovens with electric starters.
Oh, this is awful.
On a good night,we barely break even.
Tonight is gonna kill the whole week.
Not necessarily.
The stovetop's gas.
I bought pasta for the staff dinner.
You give me ten minutes,
I'll whip up a spaghetti carbonara
that'll knock their socks off.
Oh,my God!
You are a lifesaver!
And,uh, since it's not on the menu,
you can charge whatever you want-
say, 20 bucks?
For pasta? Are you crazy?
Won't hurt to ask.
Oh, I don't wanna scare them away.
Okay.
So...
good news!
Our chef is preparing his special spaghetti carbonara.
Ooh, yummy!
And we're offering that for $12.
Great!
For the appetizer portion.
The entre is $20.
Fine.
2. 22.
Okay.
shouldn't there be an emergency light?
Sometimes in these elevators there's a...
ta-da!
Well, aren't you clever?
I'll just call hotel security
and let 'em know we're-
No, wait!
This is the first time
I've had you to myself all night.
I'm sorry.
It's those fund-raisers.
Everybody wants a piece of the candidate.
What are you doing?
Taking my piece.
Are you insane? We're in an elevator.
Exactly.
Going down...
No! Come on.
Cut it out.
The power could come on at any moment.
I know.
That's what makes it so exciting-the risk.
But,uh,
I I'm kind of running for mayor here, remember?
It's an elevator, silly.
It has an emergency stop button.
I don't.
oh, my God,that's amazing!
What are you doing?
That's my phone.
It's on vibrate.
Oh,God!
Oh, man, I was just starting to get into it.
Less talking, more dressing.
You two okay?
Yeah, fine, thanks.
Must've gotten pretty hot in there.
You have no idea.
Karen,don't worry about a thing.
I'll collect your mail till you get back.
Well, how long's this blackout supposed to last?
Well, they say it may last for days.
Days?!
Uh... hey, Blondie, come here.
Come here.
Hey,listen,
I don't really need to go to the hospital.
I'm fine.
You fractured a rib,
and you might've a concussion.
You need looking after.
No, some of the stuff in my freezer might melt.
How about I just run out and get some ice
and then meet you at the hospital?
Ma'am, you can replace groceries.
You don't understand.
Some of my groceries they-
they have sentimental value.
Sorry.
Yeah,well, I don't need to ask your permission.
Ma'am, no!
Get your hands off me, you big ape!
Get the restraints.
I'm gonna sue your ass!
Hey!
Well, what are we waiting for?
Get me to the hospital.
I'm not a well woman.
What was that all about?
Your friend's afraid the stuff
in her freezer is gonna spoil.
Oh,well, thank God the power's back on.
Now she won't have to worry.
I made you waffles!
Eat 'em while they're hot.
What?
Will you marry me?
They're just toaster waffles.
Ah,that was just the pre-proposal, actually.
The real one will be much more romantic
with a big diamond the size of a doorknob.
But just so you're prepared,
I do wanna marry you.
Well,just so you're prepared,
consider this my pre-refusal.
Come on. What's wrong?
You're wearing my shirts.
You burn my breakfast.
You're here every night.
It's like we're married already.
We're having a good time.
Why risk ruining it?
See,what happened to the thrill seeker
that seduced me in the elevator?
She wouldn't be afraid of taking a little risk.
Oh, you don't wanna marry her.
She's a tramp.
Hold out for a good girl.
No, no, no.
I've found what I'm looking for.
Come on. What gives?
Look, Victor...
getting divorced really kicked my ass.
I'm sorry. Just...
Next time I get married,I've gotta be sure.
Okay, I get it.
I just wish there was a way
I could prove how much I love and adore you.
Well, if you can choke down
that lousy waffle I made you,
that'd be a starT.
Oh, there's Mike.
Should we see if he's free Friday night?
Yeah. Yeah, why not?
Sure.
You know what?
Do you wanna run this ice cream side before it melts?
look, Ian is going to come invite you to dinner Friday,
and you are not-I repeat-
not going to accept.
Why is Ian inviting me to dinner?
He wants to thank you for saving us,
and he wants to show that he's not jealous of you.
How's that for irony?
I didn't plan to kiss you,
but you didn't exactly resist.
I was in shock.
Why were you so upset when you mentioned Ian?
Because we had just had a fight...
about you.
Really?
You talk about me a lot?
Mike, I am marrying ian.
We have hired a caterer.
We are going with the salmon,
so just back off!
Hey, Ian.
Hi, Ian.
I just asked Mike.
He can't make it.
Yeah, I'm sorry.
I've got plans tonight.
Oh, but didn't we say Friday?
Friday?
Oh, Friday I'm wide open.
Splendid!
Shall we say 7:30?
It's a date.
Edie!
Mrs. Epstein!
Listen, I'm late for my hadassah meeting.
Here's the key.
Take your time.
Oh, and don't be shy.
Check out those closets.
They're very spacious.
Edie, what are we doing here?
Checking out a house.
I told you,I'm not looking to buy right now.
Well, who's talking about buying anything?
I...
am giving it away.
Edie, we cannot have sex in here.
It's someone else's bed!
That's just wrong!
Look, we can't use my place.
We can't use yours.
But I'll be damned
if I am gonna pay for a hotel room
When there are all of these empty houses
all over town that I have the keys to.
Though reluctant at first,
Carlos soon saw the wisdom in Edie's plan.
Secret affairs are a lot like real estate.
The three keys to success are...
location...
location...
location.
careful. I can't sit down that fast.
Sorry. I'm sorry.
But it's gonna be worth it.
Okay, so tell Tom the secret of your risotto.
Well, I suppose? spinach and onions in white wine-
no, no, the profit margin.
Uh, basically, it costs a dollar to make-
and we charge $20!
4 people who would've shared a $15
pizza are now spending 80 bucks.
Okay, kids, dig in!
There's just one little problem with that, Lynette.
Yeah?
Those families you're talking about have kids,
and there's no kid that's gonna eat anything
with spinach in it.
Um, Tom...
it's delicious,huh?
Mm-hmm! Oh, yeah!
Yeah?
Rick learned how to make this in Italy.
Go ahead.
Try it.
I wanna see what you think.
It's good.
It's awesome!
It's good.
But?
But it's just not us.
Us?
What is us?
Look,we're a neighborhood pizza place.
We serve pizza.
I like this better.
I'm getting bored of pizza.
Porter, the adults are talking.
Look,we serve good food at good prices.
We're not looking to be the next, you know,
trendy flash in the pan.
That's-that's not what I'm looking for either.
Um, see, my food it's not trendy.
It's classic.
Rick...
obviously you're a great cook,
and when you have your own place,
I will definitely eat there,
but I see no reason to change my menu.
More, please!
Hi! Can I help you?
Uh, yeah, I'm here to see Mr. Lang.
He's not here. Is that for him?
Yeah. But it's very personal.
Okay.
I don't think I should leave it with the maid.
Do I look like the maid? Give me that!
Victor Lang if you want the negatives. I demand $50,000!
Do not call the police! I will contact you!
You! Blackmailer!
Oh, man, you weren't supposed to look!
Get off of me!
Ow! No!
$50,000? Are you insane?!
No, that's not for you to decide!
I want all the negatives of those photos, or I start breaking fingers!
No, you can't break my fingers!
Come on! Aah!
Give me the pictures!
Hey, hey, hey, hey! Hey, break it up!
Break it up! Come on! Come on!
She's crazy! She's crazy!
That's for calling me a maid!
He works the hotel security monitors.
That's how he got the photos.
That miserable cockroach.
Well, if you wanna smack him around a little,
I can go inside and turn up the radio.
Again, no, thank you, but I will need those photos.
Oh, no, no, I'm gonna hang on to these.
They're a little revealing.
Ma'am, we can't charge him without evidence,
and if he walks,
he can do what he wants with the originals.
Okay... yeah.
But guard them with your life.
Yeah, especially that one.
We've been open for three months now,
and we've barely turned a profit!
We are building a customer base! That takes time!
Go on, ask her.
No, you ask her!
Why are you being so stubborn?
And you would rather see the restaurant
fail than succeed with Rick's idea!
And I can't believe that you two
are ready to toss out my concept.
You know, why don't you just rename the restaurant
"Lynette and Rick's"?
Can we have fudgsicles?
No!
Sorry, Lynette, but the menu is not changing.
End of discussion.
I don't think so.
I'm giving it a try.
That's not your decision to make.
Yeah? Well, then why don't you come down
to the restaurant and stop me?
Oh, that's right. You can't.
I told you she'd say no.
Mrs. McCluskey always has some fudgsicles.
Yeah, but she's in the hospital.
Where's the ice cream?
She didn't have any.
Oh, man!
There wasn't anything good in there?
No.
Lang sexcapade caught on tape!
what the hell were you thinking?
How was I supposed to know the cops were
gonna release the photos to the press?
Everybody in town knows the police chief
is the mayor's brother-in-law-everyone!
Enough, Jerome!
I want you to organize a press conference,
and then I want you to help me prep for it.
Well, this is gonna be a bloodbath.
I don't know how you're gonna prep.
Just get me a bucket of piranhas, and I'll stick my head in it.
You know, you're a single guy. Maybe people won't care.
I'm running a family values campaign,
and I had sex in an elevator.
I think they will care.
look, I know this is my fault,
so if you wanna bite my head off, go ahead.
You know, Gaby, there are only two things that
matter to me these days my campaign and you.
And if I had to lose one of them,
I'd rather it was the campaign.
Is there anything I can do?
Uh, yeah, you can stick around on election night.
I have a feeling I'm gonna need some serious consoling.
Mmm! God, that is so good!
I know. It's hard to decide, huh?
No. No, I'm gonna go with the crab cakes
and the little quesadillas.
Well, all we need is a wedding cake, and we're done.
You are the most decisive bride I've ever met.
I just guess I'm in a rush.
Oh? Oh, gotcha.
Well, don't worry. You are not showing at all.
Oh, no, no, no. No, I'm not pregnant.
No, I just know know what I want, which is Ian.
So I'm just eager to... you know, no-
not get it over with, per se, but just to...
get to the good part, which is the marriage... to Ian.
Seems like a great guy.
I don't suppose he has a brother.
Oh, so you're not seeing anyone?
No, I'm between disappointments.
Well, are you free for dinner tomorrow?
Is this some lame setup?
Please say yes.
Well, there's this guy coming to dinner,
and he is single and handsome and charming and...
you had me at "guy.
So how do you know him?
Oh, uh... he's just a neighbor.
Hey, buddy, whatcha doing?
Nothing.
You seem a little mopey lately. Is everything okay?
Yeah.
Can we go see Mrs. Mccluskey?
You guys didn't have to come down here.
No matter what that C.A.T. scan says, I'm breaking out tomorrow.
Well, Parker really wanted to come vit you.
I'm gonna put a little water in these.
Don't tell your brothers. You were always my favorite.
I saw the man in your freezer.
Lynette!
Yeah?
Could you run down to the snack bar and get me some green jell-o?
Oh, sure!
Okay, time for a little grown-up talk.
So can you understand now why I had to do what I did?
And how you can never tell anyone, not even your mom?
Hey, they didn't have jell-o, so I hope pudding is okay.
Uh... yeah, let's let's give it to Parker.
A good boy like him deserves a treat.
what are you thinking about?
Just... this room doesn't really work.
It's just too sterile.
Can we go back to that Spanish Colonial on 3rd?
Sure. Fine.
You know what i was thinking?
I'm really happy, and I haven't felt this happy in a long time.
How about you?
Are you happy?
Oh, my God!
Oops, sorry. Bed's not made.
Russell!
Why don't you check out the subzero in the kitchen?
It's to die.
Well, I see you can't close a sale without opening something else.
Oh, please, I heard about your open house on Holly Drive.
They're still disinfecting the jacuzzi.
Slut.
Bitch.
you thk he's gonna tell anyone?
He's a gay realtor. He's speed-dialing as we speak.
Then go stop him.
What's the big deal?
Who cares if people find out?
I do.
Why?
Are you embarrassed to be dating me?
No! It'S... you know, if Gaby finds out,
she's gonna hit the ceiling.
Oh, why would she care? She's dating that Victor guy.
Please, that's not gonna last.
Oh, my God.
You're still in love with her.
No, I just... look, I mean,
we've been getting along, and don't wanna...
I don't know who the bigger moron is you or me.
Hey, don't be like this.
Look, we're having fun, right?
Apparently that's all we're having.
Edie, come on!
No, fun's over.
Ah, Mike. Thanks for coming.
Thanks for asking me.
Susan.
hi.
Um, Mike,
I want you to meet Maggie Gilroy.
I don't believe this.
You're setting me up?
You need to move on, okay?
I don't wanna move on.
I came here to see you.
Well, I'm not available,
so if you feel like kissing someone tonight,
point those lips at Maggie.
Here we go-your beer.
Did I mention that Maggie is an amazing chef?
We're embarrassed to be cooking for her.
Stop.
So, um, Mike, do you have a favorite type of cuisine?
Nah. After three months of prison food,
everything tastes good to me.
So you were in prison?
He was totally innocent.
Yeah, a woman was bludgeoned to death,
and her blood wound up on my wrench.
Oh, my God.
But he was cleared. All charges dropped.
Here. Eat this.
It's just so awful.
I mean, to go to jail for a crime you didn't commit.
Oh, it was just a few months.
Now my first stretch for manslaughter...
that was brutal.
My worst cellmate was this guy called "stilts".
When they arrested him, they found a bowl full of ears.
ow! I-I think that was meant for you.
Sorry.
So why don't I just go and brew some coffee?
And, uh, I brought a little surprise for dessert-
wedding cakes for you to sample.
Great.
Thanks a lot. Now Maggie thinks you're Charles Manson.
I don't care. I love you.
Don't say that.
It's true. I remember everything now.
When i got run over, I was on my way to propose to you.
I don't wanna talk about it.
I do.
What would you have said?
You know what I would have said.
It doesn't matter now.
The hell it doesn't, Susan,
if you can look me in the eye and tell me that when we kissed,
you felt nothing, then I'll just go,
but only if you can say that and really mean it.
Can you?
Who wants wedding cake?
Maggie, these cakes are fantastic.
Great. Well, all you have to do is choose one, and we're done.
Did you notice the themes?
Themes? Yes.
This one is very British fondant icing and toffee ganache.
And this is your classic American-
white cake with buttercream frosting.
So which one do you like the best?
Wow. It's kinda hard to decide.
Well, that depends on what you're looking for-
rich and elegant...
or down-to-earth and sweet?
I don't know.
You want to taste 'em again?
No, I know what they taste like.
I'm just torn, okay?
There's no need to get upset.
It's-it's just a cake.
It's not just a cake. It's a major decision!
Well, hey, if you like 'em both so much,
why don't-why don't you have two cakes?
How would that look?
"Oh, hey, everybody!
Here's my wedding cake.
Oh, and what's that over there?
It's my other wedding cake. "
I have to pick, and I will!
So just stop pressuring me, okay?
I'm sorry.
I think I was just having a little sugar rush.
Thanks again, and sorry.
seriously, just put it on hold for just a month or two.
Excuse me. Am I interrupting something?
No. It's nothing.
I think it's time to level with him.
I just told Susan I want her back.
Excuse me?
Look, I know it puts a crimp in your plans,
and I'm sorry, but I love her.
Well, that's too damn bad, isn't it?
Because she doesn't love you.
Really?
She didn't seem to mind when I kissed her.
What? Did he just kiss you?
No. It-it was days ago.
And you let him?!
No! He-he pounced.
It was hardly a pounce.
You bastard. We... we had an agreement.
Susan doesn't have to marry you because you won her in a game of cards.
What, he didn't tell you how we played poker for you?
You bet me in a game of poker?
It's not-not how it sounds.
I merely suggested that that if I won the hand,
then he-he would stop badgering you.
And if he won?
Well, I-I forget the exact terms,
but the point is, he lost, as I knew he would.
I never would have wagered you if I didn't have a very good hand.
Get out!
Susan, please.
You heard her.
You, too.
I've had it with both of you.
You're tugging at me like I'm some kind of wishbone.
You're just upset.
No, I am beyond upset.
You two want a decision? Well, here's what I decide.
There will be no kissing, and there will be no wedding,
and there will be no damn cake!
what's this?
Uh, pumpkin sage ravioli.
It's a little thank you for taking a chance on me.
Are you kidding? I should be thanking you.
We took in 3 grand tight.
Oh, woW. Candles, too?
Yeah, I think we should use 'em all the time.
It softens up the ambience.
So come on. Eat.
Oh. Oh, my God.
If we serve this for tomorrow's special, will will clear 4 grand.
Great. Uh... just be sure to run it by Tom.
Why? You know he'll just shoot it down.
I mean, I get it. He's in pain.
He doesn't like being sidelined, but that is no reason to...
you know what? Let's talk about something else.
Yeah, sure.
I mean, unless you'd like to go.
You're here so late all the time.
No. No, I like being here.
It beats going home to an empty apartment.
Don't you have any friends to hang out with?
My friends come in two varieties the ones I drove away
before I got clean and the ones
I should avoid if I wanna stay clean.
Oh, yeah. I gotcha.
you ever wear your hair down?
What?Yeah, sometimes. why?
It looks really good.
You should do it more often.
Oh, well... thanks.
This is delicious.
Thanks.
Do you want some more wine?
Sure.
daddy!
The paper has a story about your restaurant.
You're kidding!
Well, come-come here. What does it say?
"When Scavo's Pizzeria opened its doors, you could almost hear the city groan,
"'just what we need another pizza joint.
' But with an updated menu from new chef rick coletti... "
is he the man who cooked us that really, really
Yeah, that's the one.
What-what else does it say, honey?
"There's more than just crayons on the table.
"The veal piccata is divine, "and the mushroom risotto is an...
e-x-q-u-"
exquisite.
"An exquisite treat.
"Scavo's has been transformed from
a mundane family eatery into the area's hottest-"
that's enough, Kkayla. Daddy's tired.
Okay.
More fallout from Lang bang.
Okay, I know you guys like a good scandal,
but I think the citizens of Fairview
are more interested in the real issues.
Mr. Lang, given your 15-point drop in the polls,
what do you have to say to your constituents?
Well, I would ask them to, uh,
not base their view of me on a single lapse of...
it's not going very well, is it?
You picked up on that, did you?
Who is she, Mr. Lang? Give us a name.
No, I will not identify the woman.
What are you hiding? Is she a prostitute?
No! She's not a prostitute.
I'll answer questions one at a time, people.
That does it.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What are you doing?
Gaby, stop, please. Please, stop.
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Excuse me. I am the woman in the photos!
what are you doing?
Standing by my man.
what's your name?
My name is Gabrielle Marquez, and I want you to know,
right before those photos were taken, Victor asked me to marry him.
what did you say?
I said, "yes.
I would be thrilled to be Mrs. Victor Lang.
Are you gonna get married?
Have you set a date?
Are you really getting married?
In fact, I was so overcome, that
when we were trapped in the elevator,
I seized the moment to...
express my joy.
So this is a love story?
The only reason Victor kept it from you was to protect me...
because he's the kind of man
who puts a woman's honor before his own,
and that's the kind of man you marry.
That's the kind of man you vote for.
Where are you honeymooning?
What's that smell?
Ma'am.
Are you Karen McCluskey?
That little bastard gave me up, didn't he?
Today, at the Mayoral candidate's press conference,
A woman identified as Gabrielle Marquez, a former model,
surprised reporters by announcing her engagement to Mr. Lang.
the only reason he didn't tell you was because he was protecting me.
Carlos?
I don't know if you've heard...
Yeah. I heard.
In a few months, I will be Mrs. Victor Lang.
I just heard on the radio the power company is still having problems,
and there might be another rolling blackout today.
Do you want me to leave ida's number in case something happens?
I'm sure I'll be fine.
Did you read our review in the paper?
Yep.
Okay. I'm off.
Power it's the type of thing most people don't think about...
until it's taken away.
Whether it's the political power of the many...
or a lover's influence over just one...
we all want some sort of power in our lives...
if only to give ourselves choices.
Yes, to be without choices, to feel utterly powerless, well...
it's a lot...
like being alone... in the dark.
Previously Desperate Housewives...
I saw the man
in your freezer.
Mrs. McCluskey and
Parker shared a secret...
You can never tell anyone.
But the secret was discovered.
You bet me in
a game of poker?
Susan was forced
to make a decision.
Get out. There will be no kissing,
and there will be no wedding.
Lynette ventured into
dangerous territory.
You ever wear
your hair down?
Sometimes.
Looks really good.
Thanks.
Are you embarrassed
to be dating me?
If Gaby finds out,
she's gonna hit the ceiling.
Edie came to
a disturbing realization.
Oh, my God. You're still
in love with her.
And Gaby took a bold step.
In a few months,
I will be Mrs. Victor Lang.
I don't know my own strength...
The night of her
engagement party,
Gabrielle Solis was injured.
But she wasn't hurt
by the chauffer
who almost slammed
a door on her fingers...
Or the stranger who almost
stepped on her hand...
Or the waiter who almost
dropped a knife on her wrist.
No, Gabrielle's injury
came about in a more
unexpected fashion.
And was caused by someone
Gabrielle thought was her friend.
Thank you.
So have you told Bree
about your engagement?
Yep.
She's on the top
of a Swiss Alp
and still managed to send
a basket of muffins.
You're kidding.
No.
Damn things traveled 5,000 miles,
and they were still moist.
I don't know
how she does it.
Hey, it's getting late.
Let's break out
the champagne.
Wait, wait.
You're not gonna embarrass me
with some sappy toast, are you?
I'm not, but Susan's
written a poem.
A poem?
She's reworked
the lyrics to
"Wind Beneath My Wings. "
Testing.
One, two, three, testing.
What are you waiting for?
Get the champagne.
Okay.
Thank you.
Hey, Gaby.
Hi, Edie!
So I finally met Victor.
He is so charming.
Isn't he great?
I know it's been quick,
but he's just so amazing.
So you really love him?
He is the one?
He is, and I've never
been happier.
I am so thrilled for you.
Edie, are you okay?
Yes! Oh, yes.
Yes, I'm,
I'm fine. I...,
Oh, sweetie.
Don't worry. You're gonna
find someone soon.
I just know it.
What?
Actually, I have found someone.
And I am...
crazy about him.
Well, who is it?
Oh, no. No, no.
Tonight is about you.
Oh, no, no, Edie. Come on.
It would make me happy to know
who's making you happy.
Really?
Yeah!
I wanna know who's putting
that dopey grin on your face.
Well, actually, it's...
Carlos.
Who?
Carlos.
I've been seeing Carlos.
And this is how Gabrielle
Solis came to be injured
the night of her
engagement party.
And though she seemed
to laugh it off,
Gabrielle had been
cut much, much deeper
than anyone could see.

Greg is definitely off the wagon...
Gossip.
For most housewives, it's just
a harmless form of recreation,
An exchange of semi-Interesting
tidbits concerning
the semi-Interesting lives
of people they know.
That mailman was in Sarah's
house over an hour.
Packages weren't
all he's delivering.
I could smell the whiskey
on Amy's breath.
It wasn't even noon yet.
Joanne may say that she was
off on a religious retreat,
but since when does praying
make your boobs bigger?
But the time comes in
every neighborhood
when something very
interesting happens,
and that's when gossip stops
being recreation and becomes...
obsession.
What kind of woman would keep
her husband's body in the freezer?
For ten years?
It's crazy.
Has anybody talked to her?
I've knocked twice.
She's not answering.
Oh, I saw the curtain move.
I think I saw a hand.
Oh, great. Now we know
she's watching us.
Why should we be embarrassed?
We're not the ones who kept
a corpse-icle in the basement.
Oh, that's right.
She babysat your kids.
Oh, please, I don't want to
think of how many times
she brought them ice cream
from that basement.
I mean, jeez, if you want to
keep your husband on ice,
at least have
a dedicated freezer.
Do you think she
actually killed him?
Uh, yeah.
Why else would she
have hid the body?
Well, so far, she's only been charged
with improper disposal of a corpse.
But once they defrost the
body and do an autopsy,
I guarantee you they're gonna
find a bellyful of arsenic.
What's arsenic?
It's just... It's something
yucky, honey.
Go on and play with your ball.
Go on.
We're trying so hard to
protect them from this.
There are just some things that
kids don't need to know about.
Hell, there's some things
we don't need to know about.
Would you guys excuse me?
Hey, Edie!
Oh, hi, Gaby!
What's up?
I've been doing
some thinking, and...
you know how...
how do I put this?
You know how you feel like
sometimes people hate you?
I don't feel like that.
Well, you should,
'cause they do.
Since when?
Since you started doing
things to piss people off.
About what?
Oh, I don't know.
Off the top of my head...
dating your friends' exes.
Oh, so that big smile on your face
the other night was all an act.
You're not fine with
me seeing Carlos.
Edie, there are a thousand
single men in Fairview.
Why do you have to
date my ex-husband?
You're engaged to somebody else!
What do you care?
It's awkward!
It's like if I donated
a dress to charity,
and I went to a party,
and you showed up wearing it.
Again, if you gave it away
in the first place,
then what the hell are
you bitching about?
Look, Edie, just find
your own men
and stop snapping up
other people's castoffs!
And what if I don't?
Then be prepared to
suffer the consequences.
Oh, please.
You are as tall
as my legs.
What are you gonna do?
You're about to find out.
Who is it this time?
It's Ian.
You gonna talk to him?
No.
He's got flowers.
I don't care.
Looks like it's two dozen roses.
Oh, good. I hope the thorns
rip him to shreds.
Okay, Mom, I know what Mike
and Ian did was wrong, but...
They bet me in
a game of poker.
They made decisions about my life
over a hand of 5-card stud.
"Wrong" does not even
begin to cover it.
Okay, okay, but there are
only two guys in this world
who know all of your flaws and
have still found a way to love you.
You're just gonna
toss 'em both away?
Yes.
I don't need a man.
I don't even need sex.
I went without it
the first 16 years...
22 years of my life,
and I can go a few more.
This should be interesting.
What?
Mike just walked up.
Give it up.
She didn't answer
the first ten times.
She's not gonna
answer it now.
Oh, this is getting sad.
Take it like a brit...
Stiff upper lip.
You know what? I've just about
bloody had it with you.
I preferred you when you were
comatose and pooping in a bag!
Well, lucky for you, I don't
have that bag right now.
All right, that does it.
Uh, excuse me? Guys?
Hi.
My Mom would really like
for both of you to leave.
Don't soft, pedal it.
Let 'em know I mean business.
'Cause if you don't, she'll be
very, very disappointed.
Rip 'em!
So just, um...
go home and think about
what you've done.
If you want something
bitchier, do it yourself!
Here we are.
Ravioli stuffed with duck confit
in a porcini cream sauce.
What do you think?
I think it's a shame you didn't
make any for yourself.
Hi, honey.
Hey, I just wanted
to say I love you.
Aren't you sweet?
What's that noise in the background?
Are the boys still up?
Yeah, they don't
want to go to bed.
Well, of course they don't.
They're kids. You're the Dad.
Make 'em.
Well, I tried, honey, but
they wanna wait up for you.
They miss their Mom.
Is this your way of guilting me
into coming back home?
Lynette, the restaurant
did close a half-hour ago.
Preston, don't throw pudding!
Tom... I'm sorry.
I can't come home.
We're, um...
doing inventory, so...
it could be a while.
Well, okay.
Try to hurry?
I will.
I love you. Bye.
Inventory?
I know. I'm a horrible person.
I just chose ravioli
over motherhood.
I should, I should go home.
Lynette, you got nothing
to feel guilty about.
You bust your ass in this restaurant
every day to keep it going,
and if anybody deserves
a little downtime, it's you.
Those are shameless
rationalizations.
Keep them coming.
Those, too.
There you are.
What are you
doing outside?
Some big kids threw eggs
at Mrs. McCluskey's house.
Oh, jeez.
They shouldn't
have done that.
We should go talk to her.
No.
It's late.
She probably doesn't
want us to bother her.
Come on, bud.
Bedtime.
So here's what's
gonna happen.
We're not talking
to Edie anymore.
What do you mean, "we"?
I mean, "we" as in
she betrayed me,
and you're my best friends,
so you're gonna support me
because that's what friends do.
And "support you" means...
acting like we're in junior high?
I can't believe you're
not furious at this.
Before she sank her
fangs into Carlos,
she was dating your
ex-husband and Mike.
Yes, and do you
know who I blame?
I blame Karl and Mike.
Why isn't anybody
mad at them?
I mean, let's face it.
The men, they get
away with murder.
They're scum!
Okay.
Back to Edie, I'm not sure
I'm comfortable ganging up on her.
Really?
Because I wasn't very
comfortable taking your side
when you were feuding with Patty
Monroe over the backyard fence line,
but I did.
Oh, Gaby, that's not fair.
Nobody really liked
Patty to begin with.
Don't even get me started about
what I've done for you, okay?
I'm still boycotting
Madame Kim's day spa
because of your
botched bikini wax.
Oh, my God. How do you
botch a bikini wax?
She will show you later!
The point is, good
friends share more
than just gossip and brunch.
They share enemies, too.
So are you with me or not?
Of course we're with you.
We will give Edie
the cold shoulder.
No, no! Not cold, frozen!
I want icicles hanging
from that bitch's ears!
Hello?
Hi.
Hey, do you still want me
to look at that book report?
Daddy helped me yesterday.
You weren't home.
Oh, okay.
Daddy does everything lately.
How come you always
come home so late?
Well, I'm really busy
at the restaurant.
Believe me, I come home to
Daddy just as soon as I can.
You're lying.
What?
You always laugh like that
when you're telling a lie.
Why would you say that?
Because... it's true.
I stay late because there's
a lot of work to do,
and right now I'm the only
person who can do it,
And now I have to go
to the grocery store
because I am the only
person who can do that.
So why don't you go upstairs
and finish your homework?
Okay.
But it is what you do.
Excuse me!
Uh, hey!
Excuse me.
That's my space!
Yeah, well, I'm parked in it,
so that kind of makes it my space.
I waited for that spot while the guy made
three phone calls and flossed his teeth.
You can't just steal it.
It's a parking space!
Keep a lid on your
hormones, honey.
God! You did that on purpose!
Yeah, and I'm about to
do this on purpose, too.
Crazy bitch!
What do you think
you're doing?!
What are you doing?
What are you doing?!
I'm taking my damn space!
Get out of my car.
Get out of my car.
Say you're sorry.
Let me go!
Say it!
Okay, okay. I'm sorry.
Say, "I'm a rude,
arrogant bastard
who needs to treat women
with courtesy and respect!"
I'm a rude, arrogant...
How does the rest of it go?
Freeze!
Was this man trying
to steal your car?
It's my car!
She tripped me and
grabbed my keys.
Is this true, ma'am?
Oh, all right,
take his side!
Hey, who you spying on?
Lynette.
She hasn't returned
my last two phone calls.
I think something's up.
She's probably just busy.
Yeah, we'll see about that.
I am calling her right...
now.
Oh, my God!
What?
She just screened me!
I have been screened!
Maybe she's in a hurry.
No, no, no.
This has Gabrielle Solis
written all over it.
She is turning people
against me.
And you're surprised?
I told you how she'd react if
she found out about us.
Yeah?
Well, if she wants to play
these schoolgirl games, fine.
'Cause I invented 'em.
Lynette!
Hi!
Hey, hey!
I just tried calling you.
Oh, really?
My ringer must've been off.
Oh, no prob.
I wanted to invite you and the boys to
Travers' birthday party on Saturday.
Yeah, I'm having
this reptile guy,
and he's got all these
cool snakes and lizards.
The boys would love that,
but unfortunately,
I gotta work.
Well, that's a shame, because
I was hoping you could cater.
Cater?
Yeah, I'm gonna need pastas
and salads for the parents
and at least 20 pizzas
for the kids.
That many?
Yeah, and...
well, you know kids.
If one has a pizza party,
they're all gonna want a pizza party.
Could be good for business.
Well, yeah, I guess
I could work somethin' out.
I knew I could count on you!
Love ya!
Look, whatever that
cop report says,
I do not have
"anger issues. "
I was just having a bad day.
You threatened to
decapitate a man
over a parking space.
A very bad day.
Susan, when someone
loses it like you did,
there's usually a reason.
Are things going
okay at work?
Work is great.
You could just sign that paper
and tell the judge I'm fine.
What about your family?
Family's terrific.
Seriously, you're just
wasting your time here.
How's your love life?
Cancel my lunch.
I'm gonna be
here for a while.
Will you stop
ringing that damn...
I'm sorry, Parker.
I thought you were one of
those little pissants who keep
ringing the bell
and running away.
So what's on your mind?
I want you to come
back and babysit us.
The new sitter stinks.
Your folks hired
a new sitter?
Yeah, and she thinks
carrot sticks are snacks.
Well, that's rough, but...
life's like that sometimes.
It doesn't have to be.
If you just told people what
happened with your husband,
everything could go back
to the way it was.
Parker, you see those
women over there?
Nothing I could say would stop
those tongues from wagging.
I'm sorry, kid, but...
I just have to wait
this one out.
Can you imagine?!
I mean, finding out that
two men you trusted
bet you in a poker game.
I mean, how demeaning is that?!
Well, it depends on
how you look at it.
Men have been waging contests
over women for centuries.
I grant you, poker isn't as
romantic as, say, jousting,
But it shows how
they felt about you.
The real question
is how did you feel about them?
I told you,
hurt and betrayed.
No, how did you
feel about them
before this poker business?
Well...
I was engaged to Ian, so...
obviously I loved him.
And Mike?
Were you in love
with him, too?
How we doing on time?
Susan.
Okay, fine,
I loved him.
I still love him,
and I love Ian.
So I am totally, hopelessly
in love with two men.
Now we're getting
somewhere. This is good.
No, this is horrible!
This wasn't supposed
to happen!
I only let myself
fall for Ian
'cause I thought Mike
was lost to me.
And then bang!
Suddenly he wants me back,
and now I have this choice
that I can't possibly make.
I agree. It's tough.
It's devastating!
If I go with Mike,
Ian's heart will be broken,
and Ian does not deserve that.
But how can I reject Mike
after all he's been through?
So you're just gonna walk
away from both of them?
You have to make
a choice, sweetie.
You've got two great guys,
both of them crazy about you.
To let one go, well,
that's life. It happens.
To let them both go...
that's just...
Stupid?
Yes.
That would be
the clinical term.
Sounds great. Thanks.
Hey,
how would you like to eat something
that's neither pasta nor pizza?
Such food exists?
Don't tease me.
No, my friend Al, he's opening
a soul food place,
and Sunday night, he wants to test the
menu with some of his chef buddies.
He said I could
bring someone.
And... And you want
me to go wi you?
It'll be after we close.
And don't tell me that
you hate southern food,
'cause then
we can't be friends.
No, I love it.
It's just that's a little
late for me, and...
Oh, okay.
I just thought it'd be fun.
No, it would be, but Sunday
nights are kind of crazy.
I'm packing lunches and
checking homework...
Right, right.
No worries. I get it.
You're just, uh,
first person I thought of.
You know,
maybe I should go.
It's part of the job to check
out the competition, right?
Yeah, absolutely.
It never hurts to see
what else is out there.
I agree.
Hey, guys, go check
out the snakes.
I'll give you some
pizza later, okay?
See you later.
All right, I'll see you later.
Hey, you want some pizza?
Yeah.
There you go.
Lynette!
What are you doing here?
Edie asked me to cater.
I know, I'm a total whore,
but please don't rat
me out to Gaby.
Hi, Susan!
I have 30 copies
of your book.
The kids can't wait
for you to sign it.
Come on, let's go!
Come on, come on!
Looks like we're working
the same corner.
Yeah, only I didn't know Edie was
gonna have the party in a park.
What if Gaby see us?
Trust me, we can both relax.
I talked to her this morning,
and she's out with Victor all day.
Well, that's a relief.
Go ahead. I dare ya.
What's going on?
Hey, don't do that!
Why not?
Because she's not a witch.
How do you know?
'Cause she isn't.
Don't be a jerk.
What is she, your girlfriend?
Parker's in love!
Shut up!
Hey, you boys!
Knock it off!
Parker, I'm so sorry.
Are you all right?
You know, everything
would be okay
if you'd tell people
what you told me.
You can make 'em stop.
Hey, Lynette, it's Gaby.
Victor got pulled into some photo
op at the homeless shelter.
So I'm free for lunch.
You wanna go with?
I tried Susan but
she's not home,
which is weird because her
car's in the driveway...
and so is yours.
Where is everybody?
Down! Down! Down!
Lynette, what is
wrong with you?!
Gaby's coming.
What?!
I thought you said
she was with Victor.
I was wrong. I was wrong.
Come on. Follow me.
Follow me.
Mommy, can I play?
No! Go ride the python!
Come on.
Okay, okay,
she's circling the park.
I wish she'd hurry.
I'm terrified of snakes.
Yeah, I'm more terrified of Gaby.
Okay, good, good.
We're almost home free...
What?
Don't turn around.
Lynette! Susan!
Hey, Gab. Hi.
What are you
two doing here?
What are we doing here?
Well, Edie hired me to cater,
so it's just business.
I don't know
what her excuse is.
You are so dead.
I don't believe it.
This is an absolute betrayal
of our friendship.
Gaby, she asked me
to make 20 pizzas.
I couldn't turn it down.
This is so delicious.
Is that what our friendship
is worth to you, 20 pizzas?
We had a pact!
Come on, Gaby, be fair.
You put us in a really
awkward position.
Me?! You two owe
me an apology.
No, Gaby, be reasonable.
I am leaving this party right now,
and if you two don't come with me,
our friendship is over.
No, I mean it.
What?!
Carlos, stop!
Put me down!
What are you doing?!
Stop it!
Carlos, put me down!
How dare you
maul me like that!
You were ruining
Travers' birthday party.
What the hell is
wrong with you?!
I'm sorry. Betrayal
makes me a little cranky.
Come on, Gaby.
You can't tell Susan and Lynette who
they're allowed to be friends with.
It's ridiculous.
I'll tell you what's ridiculous.
You not having the guts to tell
me you were dating Edie.
Oh, here it is.
Yeah. I had to find out from her
at my damn engagement party.
Well, I had to hear that you were
engaged to that Victor guy on the news.
I didn't plan it that way.
It was spur of the moment.
Oh, so you just said,
hey, what the heck?
You even in love
with this guy?
Yes, deeply.
Must be nice.
Well, aren't you
in love with Edie?
We're having fun together,
but it'll never be serious.
So, if I'm just dating,
and you're in love
and getting married...
remind me again why it is that
you get to be the angry one.
I'm sorry, Carlos.
You should be.
And for the first time,
Gabrielle was willing to let
Carlos be with someone else...
because she knew...
he still belonged to her.
Feel free to take home as
much cake as you want.
I do not want to be tempted.
I might take a little
for Tom and...
Hi, Mrs. McCluskey.
Would you like some cake?
I didn't come for sweets.
I know you people have
been talking about me,
and I guess the only way to
shut you up is to come clean.
So...
who would like to hear
the gruesome details?
I would.
If you feel like it.
Well...
First off, and I know this
will disappoint some of you,
but I didn't kill Gilbert.
I came home from a weekend
in Laughlin and found him
in front of the tv, dead.
He still had the
remote in his hand.
Good Lord.
It was 2:00 a. m.,
so I decided to wait until morning
to call the funeral home.
And I went to his
desk to make sure
everything was in order.
I found his pension plan...
and guess what?
In the event of his death,
I was not the beneficiary.
Who was?
His first wife.
They were married when
he started the job, for two years.
We were together
for 34 years,
and that idiot didn't
change the paperwork.
I not only lost my Gilbert,
but I was about
to lose everything.
So I, um...
You put him in the freezer
and kept cashing the checks.
Well, what else
was I gonna do?
Besides, after a while, it was
kind of nice having him around.
Anyway... that's the truth.
You ladies have my permission
to pass it along...
not that some of you ladies need it.
Probably weren't expecting
to see me, huh?
Well, after 20
unanswered calls...
no, not really.
About that, obviously,
I have been very confused.
I finally saw a therapist.
Actually, it was sort of a
court-ordered thing. Anyway...
Well, I need to talk to you.
You sound... sure.
I am.
I'm gonna marry Ian.
Believe me,
this wasn't easy,
Especially when you started to
remember how it was between us.
Maybe if the timing
had been different...
It wasn't.
I'm sorry, Mike.
Well, at least
I have my memories.
You ready to go?
Yeah.
I told kim that we'd be out the rest of
the evening and she's gonna lock up.
Great. I'll just get my jacket.
Okay.
Hey! You got a table for seven?
Hey! Hi! What are
you doing here?
Well, the kids wanted
to surprise you,
and it's been forever since we've
all had dinner together, so...
Well, how did you t here?
I mean, you're not
supposed to drive.
I took a cab, a double-dose
of the painkillers, and voil.
You surprised?
Yeah, a little.
We missed you.
I missed you, too.
Hey, why don't you guys
go grab that big table,
and I will have Rick whip
something up for us?
Wow, you smell good.
It must be the basil.
It has a kind of sweet smell.
Hey, Kayla, can you get a high
chair for your sister, please?
All right, who wants pizza?
Hi. Uh, change of plans.
Yeah. Yeah, I see.
But... I'm sorry.
You could still go.
Oh, no. No, no. I'll stay.
I'll cook for your family.
Thanks. Thank you.
Thanks, sweetie.
You are taking such
good care of me.
When's Lynette
getting home?
As soon as she
closes up the pizzeria.
Is that guy Rick helping her?
He better be, for as much
as we're paying him.
I think Lynette likes him.
Sure. He's a nice guy,
hard worker.
No, I mean,
she likes him, likes him.
What makes you say that?
Just something I noticed.
Well, good night, Daddy.
Mrs. Susan Hainsworth.
God, I love the sound of that.
Or did you want to keep your name?
Because I love the sound of that, too.
As long as I get to
call you my wife.
Deal.
You do realize we're gonna be
blissfully happy, don't you?
I mean, it could actually
get a bit disgusting.
People might throw fruit.
Oh, I'm gonna
lock up down here.
Why don't you go upstairs
and warm up the bed?
You do realize we're gonna
be great together, don't you?
I know.
Hey, Susan.
I don't mean to bug you.
There's just so much
I didn't get to say.
I... God, I'm lousy
at good-byes.
Anyway, you will always be
the best thing that ever
happened to me, and,
Well, I hope you find
the happiness you deserve.
Bye.
Oh, this is Mike.
Hey, Susan.
I don't mean to bug you.
There's just so much
I didn't get to say.
I... God, I'm lousy
at good-byes.
Anyway, you will always be
the best thing that ever
happened to me, and,
Well, I hope you find
the happiness you deserve.
Bye.
Oh, this is Mike.
Where are you going?
Home... to England.
To England?
What's wrong?
Well, it's just, um...
I don't think this is
going to work.
What?
But just ten minutes ago,
we were making plans,
and you were saying how great
we were gonna be together.
I saw you listening to
that message from Mike.
Ian, I made my choice.
But not for
the right reasons.
You're just trying to honor
a promise you made to me.
That's not true.
I will get over him.
You've been trying to get over him
for as long as I've known you.
Haven't had much
luck, have you?
Ian, I love you.
I know you do.
But you love him a little
bit more, don't you?
I can't live a life where every time
I see you with a faraway look,
I'll wonder if
you're thinking of him.
I'm so sorry.
You deserve to be happy.
And so do I.
Good-bye, Susan.
Hey, Mrs. McCluskey.
Lynette.
Well, it turns out our new babysitter
isn't working out too well.
Feel up to another
tour of duty?
Are you sure you want the Wisteria
witch looking after your kids?
My kids know
you're not a witch.
Too bad. I could
use the leverage.
We missed you.
Same here.
I'm gonna need
a raise, though.
I'm kinda strapped.
Okay.
I just talked to
Mrs. McCluskey,
and she is gonna start
looking after our kids again.
That's great!
Yeah.
'Cause actually, I have
been thinking, and...
it is time that
I got back to work.
What?
Yep. I'm feeling good.
I'm gettin' around better.
But...
but the doctor said your
recovery would take months,
and it's only been six weeks.
Well, it's not like I'm gonna,
you know, dead-lift a bag of ice,
but I can sprinkle
cheese on a pizza.
Besides...
I hate making you run
that place by yourself.
I don't mind.
Really?
Because before,
you said it was killing you.
Yeah, well, you know,
it is, but I just
don't want you to come
back before you're ready.
You might reinjure yourself.
I'll be careful.
The best part is we can
finally get Rick off the books.
Rick? Why would
we want to let him go?
Well, I know he's
been great, but,
his salary is cutting
into our profits.
Actually, he is bringing in more
than enough business
to cover his salary.
I mean, with all those new
dishes he's been cooking,
he's got a lot
of fans out there.
Does he really?
Yeah. I think firing him
would be a huge mistake.
Well, it's just a thought.
Well, don't think so much.
Just rest and get better.
That's what
you need to do.
You gonna be
late tonight?
Probably. We got a big
party coming in at 10:00, so...
I'll just see you
in the morning.
I'll be here.
Okay.
Hi, Ida. What's up?
That idiot postman
mixed up our mail again.
Oh, poor Mr. Henley.
He does seem to be getting worse.
Thanks for stopping by.
Hey, have you
heard about Mike?
No. What about him?
He moved.
Moved?
What do you mean?
Mona Clarke was up at 2:00
in the morning with acid reflux,
and she saw him pack
his car and everything.
Well, that doesn't make sense.
Mike wouldn't leave
without saying good-bye.
Well, he did.
According to Carlos,
something bad happened,
and Mike just wanted to
get the heck out of dodge.
It's a pity.
I always liked him.
Gossip.
It's just a harmless
form of recreation.
It's careless talk that
deals in polite fiction...
I'd love to be assistant
manager, but apparently,
you have to flirt with
Mrs. Scavo to get that job.
It's nasty speculation
that's based on
not-so-polite fact...
He may be dating Edie,
but everyone can see
he's still in love with Gaby.
How do we protect ourselves
from the venomous sting
of such idle gossip?
Are you the lady who kept
her husband in her freezer?
The best way is to
just tell the truth...
Yep, that's me.
Scary, aren't I?
And wait for people
to start talking about
someone else.
Previously on desperate housewives
Lynette made excuses...
The restaurant did close a half-hour ago.
We're doing inventory.
Carlos made a friend...
Nothing better than family.
And Edie made a pass.
Victor popped the question.
Will you marry me?
Susan let Mike down.
I love you.
But you love him a little bit more.
And Ian...
Good-bye, Susan.
let Susan go.
It can happen to anyone-
an old woman hears suspicious footsteps
as she walks down the street...
a businessman sees a
reflection in his car window...
A shop owner feels a blade...
pressed against his back...
and in that instant,
an ordinary person
is transformed into a victim.
And a world that seemed so safe
is suddenly
filled with danger.
So this little ear-shaped pasta is called...
Orecchiette.
And the cubes of bacon are pancetta.
Thank God for Italian.
You can charge way more for
"orecchiette with pancetta"
than you'd ever get for "bacon and little ears. "
Thank you.
This is nice.
It doesn't need more garlic?
No, I mean...
everything-the food, the wine...
you.
I swear, there are times this is
all that gets me through my day,
knowing at the end of it, I get
to steal this little half-hour
where I'm not a mom or a wife or a... pizza slave.
I'm just a...
tired lady with a nice man who cooks for her.
Well, it's the highlight of my day, too.
Sorry, guys.
We're closed.
Yeah, we know.
Put your cell phones on the table.
Oh, crap.
Get in there. Don't make any noise.
Oh... my... God!
Oh! Oh, my God!
They locked us in here!
It's 42 degrees! We're gonna freeze to death!
Listen, don't paniC.
I'm sure when you don't come
home, Tom will come looking for you.
No, he won't. He takes a pain pill at 10:00.
He's probably already asleep. Jeez.
How are we gonna make it
through the night in here?
Yes, in the moment it takes to bolt a freezer door,
ordinary people can become victims.
That better?
And a world that seemed so safe...
Yeah.
That helps.
...is suddenly filled with danger.
At the exact same moment his wife
was being locked in a freezer,
Tom Scavo was having a nightmare about
monsters trying to destroy his home.
But it wasn't until he woke up the next morning
that his real nightmare began.
You awake?
Yeah.
Did you sleep at all?
A little.
Thanks for not letting me freeze last night.
Are you kidding me? You're
the one that kept me warm.
You don't have a fever, do you?
No.
That's just me.
Tom's always kicking the covers off the bed.
He calls me his little blonde furnace.
He's a lucky guy.
Lynette?!
Tom! In here!
Thank God.
We were robbed!
I don't care about that. Are you okay?
Yeah. No, I'm fine.
Were you hurt?
No, no, I'm just cold.
I was so worried about you.
If you knew the places that my mind has been...
I'm sorry. I would've called,
but they took our cell phones
before they locked us in there.
"Us"?
Hey.
Hey.
I can't believe one dress could cost so much.
Well, I wanna look fabulous tonight
when Victor's elected mayor.
Yeah, but isn't it bad luck to buy a dress
for the victory party before the election?
Vern, focus. It's never bad
luck when I look fabulous.
Oh! Hi. Don't worry. I'm here now.
Yeah, but your meter just expired.
Might want to put another quarter in.
Oh, no, no.
I'm just gonna say bye to my friend, then I'm gone.
You know, this whole thing is crazy.
I go on one gay cruise and come home to
find you engaged to some rich politician.
Oh, Vern, I can't wait for you to meet him.
He's everything I've ever wanted
in a man-sensitive and kind...
and buys you $3,000 dresses.
Buys me $3,000 dresses.
And he's totally fine with you
being a high-maintenance nightmare?
Oh, my God. That's the best part. He lets me be me.
All right, I gotta get going.
See you later.
What are you doing?
I told you I was leaving. Stop writing!
Yeah, but you weren't leaving.
You were flapping your gums.
Oh, give me a break.
I was standing right there. You
could've said something.
I told you to put a quarter in... spoiled bitch.
You can't talk to me like that!
$40? You think I'm gonna pay that?
No, uh, I'm guessing it'd be the sap
that bought you the $3,000 dress.
Hey, Carlos! Wait. Hi.
Look, there's some crazy rumor
going around that Mike moved.
It's true. He went on a little
trip, and en he's heading back east.
Oh, my God. What-where is he now?
Okay, look, I know that I've
put Mike through the wringer,
but that's why I have to
talk to him-to make it right.
He's not answering his cell phone.
He turned it off.
He said he wanted to clear his head.
Okay, Carlos...
tell me where to find him.
I'm sorry, Susan. Look, you know
what they say-bros before hos.
They... say it. I... don't.
Come on. Just for my peace of
mind, I have to know he's okay.
I don't know...
What am I gonna do go hunt him down?!
I have a daughter. I have responsibilities.
Okay.
He hiked to the hot springs at
Pinewood Valley state forest.
Okay, Julie, I'm out of
here. Here's 40 bucks on the counter.
Are you sure this is a good idea?
Yes.
If I don't find Mike before he's off
that mountain, I may never see him again.
Okay, what you're doing is nauseatingly romantic,
but how do you know he even wants to see you?
I mean, after the whole "I choose Ian" thing?
That's why I have to go.
I have to make amends and heal his broken heart.
Oh, well, what if his
devastation has turned to anger,
and he's burning pictures of you in his campfire?
Well, what else can I do?
I love him. I have to go.
Then go.
Strike three! You're outta there!
Again? How are you beating me?
You got someone in there greasing
the ball for you? Huh? Huh?
Hey, come on, Travers. You can take
him. Go for the soft underbelly!
Soft?! What are you talking about?
I'm all muscle. Travers, feel that "bicep".
Mom's is harder.
Oh, well, thank you, sweetheart.
Fine. I can take a hint. I need a little exercise.
So how about we go to the
batting cages and hit a few?
Cool.
Wait! Whoa, whoa, whoa.
We're supposed to go to the movies.
How about batting cages on saturday?
Sounds great.
Yeah, we'll get to find out who
hits the ball harder-you or mom.
You are so going down. come here.
hey, who the hell is that?
Hello, Edie.
Oh. Uh, Travers?
It's your dad.
Kenya was amazing, and, uh, being a part of
Doctors Without Borders was so rewarding.
But I can't do it again, not
with the time commitment.
I'm gonna have to wait till
this little guy is in college.
So... when are you taking Travers home?
Uh, not till tomorrow.
I'm, uh, speaking at a conference
in Hilldale this afternoon.
And if you're hungry, I'm buying you breakfast.
That'd be great.
All right!
I'll help you get dressed.
You know, um... if you wanna
take a couple days and chill,
Edie and I would be more than
happy to keep looking after Travers.
Oh, thanks, but, uh, we should probably get back home.
Right.
The thing is-is...
we kind of made plans to take him
to the batting cage on saturday.
Oh. Sorry.
Uh, well, maybe you can take him the next time he visits.
Yeah, yeah.
When do you think that'll be?
I don't know. Um...
I'll have to check my schedule.
I don't mean to sound pushy. It's just, uh...
You know, the three of us, we've just-we've
been having a lot of fun together.
Well... look at the bright side-
you'll have a lot more time alone with Edie.
Yeah... that is good.
Here you go, officer.
I cued it up to the, uh, clearest shot of the guy.
Thank God you made me spring
for that surveillance camera.
I wanted to spend the money on a pinball machine.
Son of a bitch.
I think these are the same guys that hit
a couple of diners out on Mount Vernon.
You mind if I rewind?
No.
I wanna see the exact time they came in.
Oop. Whoops. Huh, overshot it a little.
I was doing receipts, and Rick surprised
me with this great idea for the menu.
It's called-what are they called?
Uh, orecchiette.
It means "little-"
I know what it means.
And he makes them with pancetta and garlic
and olive oil. It's really, really good.
It's gonna be our special tonight.
so the door was unlocked?
You need to be more careful.
The two of you are just asking for trouble.
Yeah, I guess we were.
Quiet! Quiet! They're about to announce!
...and the race in Valley Ridge
is too close to call.
However, we're now projecting a winner in Fairview.
It's Victor Lang by 10%...
Speech! Speech!
Thank you, all. I couldn't
have done it without any of you.
I would especially like to thank
my beautiful fiance Gabrielle.
And I will, as soon as the
feeling returns to my lower back.
Sir, mayor's on the phone.
Sounds like he wants to concede.
Gabrielle, congratulations.
Thank you.
Your husband runs a hell of a campaign.
We're so excited for Victor.
What a day, huh?
Well, it is ending a lot better than it started.
Oh? What happened?
Oh, this morning, I got in a fight with a parking
cop over a ticket, and the guy was a total jerk.
Well, your days of dealing with that crap are over.
What do you mean?
Mayor Johnson's wife, Sydney-
she's been collecting parking tickets
like bubble gum cards for years-
just gives them to her husband. They disappear.
Keep talking.
Honey, you are no longer one of the little people.
Forget jury duty, speeding tickets.
You rule this town now.
Well, he conceded. I'm the mayor.
You ready to be the mayor's wife?
Am I ever.
Knock, knock.
Hey. Where's Travers?
His dad's helping him pack.
God, I'm gonna miss that little guy.
It's been so much fun.
Yeah, it was.
You're gonna miss him, too, aren't you?
I know what would cheer us up.
A weekend getaway, just the two of us.
How's that sound?
Actually, I'm busy this weekend.
Really?
I thought we had plans to go to the batting cage.
Well, yeah, but that was gonna take a
couple of hours, and I'm swamped with work.
Since when?
You spent every day hanging out with me and Travers.
Exactly.
I've been putting off my work so I
could be there to help you with him,
and now it's time for me to buckle down.
So... what does that mean for you and me?
We're still gonna see each other.
I was thinking...
uh, for your birthday, that we
could go to that new oyster bar.
My birthday is two weeks from now.
Yeah. It'll be my treat.
Great.
Looking forward to it...
for the next 14 days.
Hey, uh, don't let Travers leave
without saying good-bye to me.
Oh, wouldn't dream of it.
I know how much he means to you.
Hi there.
Uh, can I get a map to the hot springs?
I'm gonna hike up there.
No problem. You got gear?
Yep.
That's not gear.
Why not?
It's tiny, ma'am. And pink.
Well, it's my daughter's.
Uh, the whole junior class has them.
Does the junior class have compasses, too?
Trail shoes? Tents?
Why would I need a tent?
It's a 2-day hike to reach the springs.
Two days?
Well, can't I just drive part of the way
and then hike from there?
That's not really how nature works, ma'am.
There are trails, not roads.
Well, maybe I am a little unprepared,
but it'll be fine.
I work out. I have quads of steel.
I'm sorry.
I just can't let you go up there-
Can't? There's no "can't" in love.
There's a man on that mountain that
I intend to spend the rest of my life with,
and nothing is gonna keep me from him not fate,
not destiny and definitely not you.
To finish my thought, ma'am.
I can't let you go up there alone.
You'll need a guide.
Cool.
How do I get one of those?
Toni, I got a hiker for ya!
This is toni, and those are quads of steel.
Thanks for suggesting we do this.
I've always wanted to try this place.
Well, you've been working for me for over a month,
and I figured it was time we got acquainted.
So much I don't know about you.
Well, I'll be happy to fill in the blanks.
What would you like to know?
Well, for starters-
are you sleeping with my wife?
What? No, Tom. Of course not.
Okay, so you're just hoping to sleep with her.
Look, if this is about the video,
I swear, I was just trying out a new recipe.
Don't give me the recipe line.
I am not an idiot.
The truth is that Lynette and
I have been going through sort of a rough patch.
Yeah, she she told me about that.
And then you came along, and wham,
it's the perfect storm.
You're young, good-looking, sensitive.
Way more fun than five screaming kids
and a cranky, invalid husband.
Tom, seriously, nothing has happened.
And nothing is going to,
because you are gonna quit.
Quit? No. No, no.
No, I'm not gonna do that.
You want me gone, fire me.
Oh, you'd like that, wouldn't you?
Have Lynette fight for you,
while I'm the jealous jerk who can't trust his wife.
No. You have to quit.
I'm staying as long as Lynette wants me there.
And make no mistake.
She wants me there.
Oh, buddy.
You're not thinking this thing through,
because Lynette will neverleave her family.
So the best, and I mean the very best, that
you can hope for is to catch her in a weak moment
and leave a wound in her marriage that
will take years to heal, but
it will heal, because I will stand by her
and I will love her just as hard as
she hates herself for what she did.
You still feel like sticking around?
Can I get you some more bread?
No, I think I've had just about enough.
I mean, the doctor said that Mike might
never come out of the coma.
And then when he did, he didn't even remember me.
Do you need to rest a second?
You sound winded.
No, no. I'm invigorated.
This fresh mountain air is-aah!
Little help.
So anyway, the whole situation with Mike-
it just seemed hopeless
and that's when I decided to
take a chance with Ian.
Ian is the British guy whose heart you crushed?
Yeah.
What was I supposed to do, wait forever for Mike?
No, seriously, I was asking.
What would you have done?
I would have waited for him.
Well, clearly, you were not paying attention, because I did go
back to Mike the second he woke up, and he'd totally forgotten me!
But none of that matters anymore 'cause...
Bug.
You know, the bugs can't get in
if you keep your mouth shut.
Travers.
I have someone who wants to meet you.
A puppy!
Yeah.
You wanna hold him?
He's awesome.
Are you gonna keep him?
No, he's not mine. He's yours.
No way!
Well, way!
I just rescued him from the pound.
So. What you gonna call him?
Fenway. After Fenway Park.
That is so cute!
Everybody back home is gonna be so jealous.
But, mom. I can't take him home.
Dad's allergic.
That's right. Shoot.
Oh, I'm gonna have to take poor little Fenway
back to the pound.
No! Why can't I keep him here?
Well, you don't visit here very often, and-
and I can't take care of a dog all by myself.
Well, I don't know what else to do.
Why can't I just visit you more?
Hey, that's a thought, and Carlos would love it, too.
Of course, I don't know how your father
would feel about joint custody.
I'll talk to him.
I'll tell him I want it.
Really? Well, that would be great.
But you better make sure that he knows
that it was all your idea, okay?
We're about three hours from the hot springs.
So if we get an early start tomorrow,
we should be there by lunch.
What are you doing?
Oh, it's a face mask.
It's lavender and honey.
You want some?
Honey, huh?
So you're in the middle of the woods, getting
ready to smear your face with bear food?
Well, I wanted to look nice for Mike.
Lord knows I don't want to hear you
talk about this anymore
but what exactly do you think is
gonna happen with you andhis guy?
Well. I'm going to apologize, and
then I'm gonna tell him that
I made a huge mistake-
No, no, no, no. After that.
Say he accepts your apology.
You get back together, and then what happens?
You know, after the novelty wears off?
Well, then.
We'll just be happy.
Okay, I know it's dark, but I can see you.
Look, after hearing your whole history with Mike
it doesn't take a genius to figure out
what the problem is.
What is it?
You.
You don't want to be happy.
You're a drama junkie.
When there is no drama, you create it.
You sleep with your ex-husband,
you cheat on a coma victim
and now you're hiking up a mountain after a guy
who has no idea you're coming.
Who knows?
Maybe this guy will take you back.
But once the dust settles,
you'll kick up some more
because you don't know how to Just Be Happy.
You don't even know me.
How dare you talk to me like that?
Ooh, so dramatic.
I'm gonna turn in now.
All right, sunshine, let's get moving.
What are you looking at?
My city.
It's like I'm seeing it for the first time.
Everything looks different now
that I'm First Lady of Fairview.
Oh, my God. You did not just call
yourself "First Lady of Fairview".
Well, well, well.
Who do we have here?
Oh, wouldn't you just love to rub
his nose in your newfound power?
Vern, you're just awful.
And as it happens, so am I.
Gaby, come on, I was just joking.
Hey, lady. It's a hydrant.
You can't park there.
Really? 'Cause I just did.
Oh, you again! Gaby.
Just stand back and enjoy the carnage.
Thank you.
Now what you're about to see may astound you.
You know, I could give you
another ticket for littering.
You could try, but you might not want to.
See, I'm engaged to Victor Lang. Ring a bell?
The mayor? Your new boss?
I don't follow politics.
Let me know when the carnage begins
so I can shield my eyes.
Listen, buddy, you're not getting it.
You answer to me now.
I could have you fired.
You can't do nothing.
I can do whatever I want!
In fact, my first official act of
business as mayoress of Fairview...
is to declare today "free parking day"!
Hey, knock that off. Hey!
Free parking!
Give me that!
No!
Give me that!
Ow, you're hurting me!
You know what that sound is, fat boy?
The sound of your career circling the bowl.
Yeah, you're gonna find out what happens
when you screw with the first lady of Fairview!
Okay, north.
I need north.
Moss grows on the north side of trees.
What?
Ugh, damn it!
Stupid mossy trees!
Dad!
Hey, hey, buddy!
How you doing?
Good.
Can I ask you a question?
Sure. You can ask me anything.
How would you feel about joint custody?
You bought him a puppy?
No, I bought myself a puppy.
How was I supposed to know that
he'd get so attached?
Don't lie to me, Edie.
You were trying to manipulate him.
What? Would it be so terrible
to have joint custody?
In case you forgot, I am his mother.
Two weeks out of the year,
and that's the way you wanted it.
Well, I changed my mind.
Aw, damn it, Edie.
We had an agreement!
It wasn't official!
And there isn't a judge in this world
that would keep a mother from her child.
Hey, Travers. What's going on?
Mom and Dad are fighting.
You wanna go watch TV at my house?
Okay.
I'll see you there in a sec, buddy.
You haul me into court, and so help me,
I will destroy you!
You threaten me again, and I will go for
full custody, you-you son of a bitch.
Oh, hi.
Hey.
So. What is going on?
Edie has lost her mind.
For eight years, she's been happy
to see him two weeks a year.
Now out of the blue,
she's gotta have joint custody.
Really?
Yeah. And how's that supposed to work?
We live four hours away.
What's he gonna do, go to two different schools?
I don't know what to tell you, man. I'm sorry.
Yeah, thanks.
You know, I just don't get it.
Edie's been perfectly happy with our arrangement.
What the hell's gotten into her?
Well, thanks.
Good night.
Come again.
There.
Hey...
I made you an espresso.
Great.
You okay?
You've been so quiet all night.
I had lunch with Tom today.
That's funny.
He didn't mention it.
He asked me if I was sleeping with you.
What?
I'm so sorry.
Oh, my God.
I'm so sorry.
That paranoid idiot.
You know, I knew it.
I knew when we were watching
the surveillance tapes that
he would completely misinterpret it.
Oh, did he?
Did he what?
Uh, did he misinterpret it?
Or did he just see what is obvious
that you and I can't admit?
I ahem-don't know what you're talking about.
There's nothing to admit.
Lynette, how long are we gonna kid ourselves?
I have feelings for you.
I know you feel something for me.
Stop!
Don't say it!
You cannot say these things.
Come on.
We both know it's true.
We've been flirting since we met.
Yes, flirting!
That's it!
It's what married people do,
because we know there is a line you don't cross.
And maybe I've gotten close to that line,
and maybe I've enjoyed getting close to that line,
but I have never once crossed it.
Look, I know I don't have much to offer-
and I have nothing to offer!
I am taken!
God!
Great, great.
Now-now what, you're mad at me?
Yeah, I'm mad!
I am mad because I loved our nights together.
It made me feel sexy and happy,
and, God, how I needed that.
And now it's over.
You ruined it.
You can't work here anymore.
Wait...
You're gonna fire me?
Oh, jeez.
What choice do I have?
Lynette. Lynette, please-
Don't touch me!
You have to go now.
Please, go.
You have to go now.
Go on.
Go.
Her name is Susan Mayer,
and she's never hiked before.
Now this is the last place I saw her,
but honestly,
she could be anywhere.
Just checking back in.
The name's Delfino.
Delfino.
Great. You're all set.
Are you sure she's lost?
Of course I'm sure.
She's a dippy brunette from the suburbs.
She didn't bring a compass.
She brought makeup.
Wait, is she the one looking for
the guy at the hot springs?
Yep, that's her.
Now let's go find her before she falls off a cliff.
The woman is a total klutz.
Yeah, I hear you.
All right, we'll split up.
I'll take north of the river here,
and you look down in here.
Excuse me.
This klutz...
Could you tell me her name?
Oh.
Hey...
Mike.
Um, listen, I know your cell phone's off,
but I...
I wanted you to know that
I followed you up to the hot springs, and...
Now i'm lost.
You know, in the off chance that I get
devoured by a mountain lion, I-
I just wanted you to know that, um...
I love you.
I've always loved you.
And I don't want any more drama.
And if you take me back,
I promise there won't be.
Unless I get eaten by a mountain lion,
and, you know,
that'll be dramatic,
but it won't be my fault.
Anyway, um...
I hope it's not too late,
but if it is, I just...
I just want you to know that I am so, so...
Sorry.
Here she is, sir.
No charges, no press.
Never happened.
Hi, honey.
You look handsome in a tux.
Jerome, give us the room, please.
All right, look,
I know you're mad, but
wait till you hear what
that jerk did to me-
Gaby, shut up.
Are you familiar with the quote
"From the one to whom much has been entrusted,
even more will be demanded"?
Um...
Doesn't ring a bell.
From the bible.
That explains it.
This is not a joke!
I have been elected mayor.
Certain things are expected of me.
One in particular is that my future wife
not assault city employees.
He was mean. He deserved it.
I don't care!
Your behavior reflects on me,
and I can't do my job
if you're constantly humiliating me.
Constantly? Aside from today,
give me one example.
Okay, how about jumping into my arms
like a 10-year-old at the election party?
I was just joking around, being me.
I thought you liked that.
I do, in private.
In public, you have to act like a grown-up.
Okay.
I'm sorry I disappointed you.
It won't happen again.
I better get dressed.
I don't want to be late to the victory party.
What happened to your wrist?
Oh.
That's what I was trying to tell you.
The meter man-
he grabbed my arm and twisted it.
What?
My God, he left a bruise.
Mm, it's not as bad as it looks.
Still, he shouldn't have done that.
Hey.
Hey!
You're home early.
It was kind of dead tonight.
Hi.
Ooh, sorry.
By the way, we are gonna need
to find a new chef.
Rick gave notice.
He quit?
Well, he got a better offer
from some place across town.
That's too bad.
Well...
Whatcha gonna do?
Well...
We don't have to hire someone.
I am coming back.
You sure you're ready?
Yeah.
Doctor said I can lose
the back brace next week,
and I promise I'll take it easy.
No lifting just cooking.
Well, okay, then.
I feel really good about this, hon.
I have been going nuts just lying around.
This is gonna be so great!
We're a team again.
Besides...
I missed you.
I missed you, too.
Hey, Edie?
Well, hello, stranger.
Come on in.
So what's up?
Nothing much.
I hear you're going for joint custody of Travers.
Yep.
I hired a lawyer,
and he is a real shark.
Wow, you're not messing around, huh?
I think it's important that Travers
has his mother in his life.
Of course, he'll probably want to
spend more time with his video game buddy.
Yeah.
You know, but I just keep thinking, um...
What's all this gonna be like for him-
you know, all the traveling back and forth?
He's a kid.
He'll adjust.
Yeah, plus two schools, two sets of friends.
I mean, it's not gonna be easy.
Why are you being so negative?
I thought you'd be excited about this.
I know you did.
Um...
I just want you to ask yourself,
is this all really in the best interest of Travers?
You know, kids need stability.
What about what I need?
I know that you miss him...
And I know you're worried about being lonely,
but I am going to be here for you.
Yeah, once every two weeks.
No.
I'm really going to be here for you.
And I'm gonna make you happy.
Don't say that if you don't mean it, Carlos.
I do.
All right, I'll, um...
I'll call off the lawyer.
You know, I really am goa miss him.
Yeah, me, too.
"CONGRATULATIONS
MAYOR LANG"
Ladies and gentlemen, please join me in
welcoming the next mayor of Fairview-
Victor Lang!
Your name Jeff Scott?
Yeah.
You read meters for a living?
Do you know how much I love you?
I think so.
Anyone can end up a victim...
injured by the actions of others.
But whether the damage is inflicted
by a cunning ex-wife...
or a blow delivered by
the object of our affection...
the time comes when we must pick
ourselves up and continue on our journey.
And if we can't, then all we can pray for...
is rescue.
Mike.
I twisted my ankle.
Good.
'Cause now I get to do this.
Previously on Desperate Housewives...
Carlos revealed
his deepest desire...
It's about children.
I want them so bad.
Tom forced the issue...
Are you sleeping
with my wife?
Of course not.
Rick came clean...
I have feelings for you.
I know you feel
something for me.
You can't work
here anymore.
And Susan's
tortured love life...
I was on my way
to propose to you.
Was finally...
What would
you have said?
On the mend.
Exactly one year had passed since
the night Mike Delfino and Susan Mayer
were supposed to
become engaged.
So when Mike took Susan
to her favorite restaurant,
she just knew he was
going to pop the question.
What are you
gonna have?
And when he did...
The chicken.
She'd be ready
with her answer.
But as the evening wore on,
the moment Susan
had been waiting for...
failed to materialize.
And though many opportunities
presented themselves...
the question was
never asked.
Until the thought began to
dawn on Susan that perhaps...
it never would.
Pretty quiet over there.
Was dinner okay?
If by "okay" you mean
uneventful, then yes.
Something on your mind?
Mike, what day is today?
Wednesday.
Yes.
It's also the anniversary of the day
we were supposed to get engaged.
A year ago tonight,
you were on your way
to ask me to marry you
when you got hit
by that stupid car.
Wow, that was a year ago?
Time really flies.
Is that all you have to say?
Why are you getting mad?
I thought you were
gonna propose tonight.
Susan, why would I want to
commemorate the anniversary
of the night that some
maniac put me in a coma?
Because this date has
special meaning for us.
I sat in front of that trailer for six
hours thinking you hated me,
and a proposal would've brought
the entire thing full circle.
It would've turned a bad
memory into a beautiful one.
You really thought
this through, didn't you?
Yes, I did, because
I am a thoughtful person.
And whenever we do get married, that is
something you are gonna have to work on.
I'll do my best.
By the way...
That seem familiar?
Oh, my God.
I can't believe
that you did this.
Well, I wanted to...
How'd you put it?
Turn a bad memory
into a beautiful one.
Now go sit in front
of that trailer.
I promise I'll show up this time.
Yes, Susan knew Mike was
about to pop the question,
the one she feared
he'd never ask.
Oh, Mike.
And thanks to Susan...
Will you marry me?
He never did.
Luckily, it wasn't the question
she needed to hear.
I kind of had a speech
prepared, but...
Sure.
What the heck?
It was the answer.

From the moment we
wake up in the morning...
What time is it?
Till our head hits
the pillow at night...
Did you lock the front door?
Our lives are filled
with questions...
Did you remember to buy
more shaving cream?
Simple ones that
are easy to answer.
Can I still pull this look off?
But someuestions
are so dangerous...
the truth is not an option.
Are you mad at Daddy?
No.
Why would you think that?
'Cause you're not
talking to him.
Well, when two people have known each
other as long as Mommy and Daddy have,
they don't have
to always talk.
In fact, a sign of a good relationship
is being comfortable in silence.
That's true.
Although Mommy ignoring
me last night at work
wasn't exactly what
I'd call "comfortable. "
Well, Daddy probably
didn't notice
that I was unloading 20-pound bags
of flour 'cause he still can't lift them,
so Mommy didn't exactly have time
to sit around and chew the fat.
Well, you haven't wanted to
chew the fat for five days now.
Come on, Lynette, something's
obviously bugging you.
You wanna know
what's bugging me?
I'm trying to have a lovely breakfast with
my family, and you're picking a fight.
Who's fighting?
I just wanna talk.
There's nothing to
talk about, okay?
Just leave me alone.
Fine.
Good.
Sorry I asked.
Hey, Franois,
it's Susan Mayer.
Call me as soon
as you get this.
I know I told you that my
wedding is off, but it's back on,
and I wanna see if you're still
available to do the flowers.
Bye.
Just so you know,
Ian's not the groom anymore.
Long story.
Call me.
There. I think I left
messages for everyone.
Are you sure it's okay for us to have the
same wedding I was planning with Ian?
Be honest.
Well, I stole his bride.
I guess I can poach his florist.
Gosh, I just keep thinking there's
someone I've forgotten to tell.
Caterer, band, florist...
Guests?
Oh, my God!
I had Julie call and
cancel everyone.
Just call 'em back.
You can't invite people to
a wedding on the phone.
You have to send
a proper invitation.
You want people to think
I'm a complete flake?
Hi, Curt. Susan Mayer.
You did my wedding invitations?
I'm gonna need
another batch.
Exactly the same, only change the name
"Ian hainsworth" to "Mike Delfino. "
Long story.
Call me.
Hey, what's with the frown?
You trying to get wrinkles
before the wedding?
No.
I can't find
a good flower girl.
Lynette keeps hinting
for me to use Penny.
But I saw her in that preschool
sing-along, and I am sorry,
but we are talking
zero charisma.
You know, I had a thought
about the flower girl.
You did?
My cleaning lady
has a daughter...
Where's that picture?
Look familiar?
Oh, God. She looks just like
me when I was that age!
That's what I thought.
See, this way, the wedding procession
starts with you as this beautiful little girl,
ens with you as the stunning
bride that you've become.
I love that you're so
into this wedding.
Most men would be like, "yeah, yeah,
tell me where the church is,"
but you're as obsessed as me.
You're like a hot groom and a gay
best friend all rolled into one.
Well, can you blame me for wanting to
make everything as perfect as you?
Feel better?
Yeah.
There must've been a bad scallop
in that paella last night.
You'd think that half-bottle of tequila
you drank would've disinfected it.
Sorry to interrupt.
I'm just moving some stuff
over to Susan's house.
You two shacking up now?
Actually, we're getting married.
You're kidding!
Congratulations!
Thanks.
You don't waste any time.
Well, you know,
I've already wasted a year.
I don't want to wake up one more
day without her lying next to me.
Oh, God.
Here comes what's
left of breakfast.
And you two
better be careful.
All this wedding fever
going around...
you might catch it.
Yeah, right!
What?
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't realize the concept of our being
married was such a thigh-slapper.
Come on, Edie.
Look, it's way too soon for
us to be talking marriage.
We only just started dating.
Oh, I know, but...
well, we could live together.
We're either at my house or
your house every night anyway.
Yeah, true, but...
Why not?
And we're not kids
anymore, Carlos, and,
I mean, I really
care about you.
Don't you care about me?
Of course I do.
But...
I just took over
Mike's lease yesterday.
Oh, please. Old lady Sims
can find another tenant.
Edie, I already
signed the papers.
Look, I have a responsibility.
You know, that rent helps
pay for her nursing home.
You understand, right?
Mrs. Sims?
Edie?
Edie Britt?
Hi! Are you up for a visit?
Well, of course!
What a nice surprise!
I haven't seen you for years.
Oh, I know, and
I feel awful about that.
I have always
liked you so much.
You know, Wisteria Lane hasn't
been the same since you left.
Well, with my arthritis,
I just couldn't live alone anymore.
But what I get from renting
more than pays for this place.
Well, that's good.
Although with Mike Delfino getting married,
your house is gonna be empty now.
Actually, no.
A friend of Mike's just signed
a lease. A very nice man.
What was his name?
It's here somewhere.
"Carlos Solis. "
Oh, dear.
What?
What did Mike tell
you about Carlos?
Just that he's a nice,
responsible man.
Well, he is when he's sober.
He has a drinking problem?
Well, actually,
what I heard is...
Oh, what am I doing?
I shouldn't be indulging
in idle gossip.
Edie, please!
Smack. He does smack.
What?
Good heavens!
He seemed such a nice man when
I met him, and he's got a good job.
I know.
What is that term?
"Functional junkie. "
This is very upsetting.
Maybe I should rethink this.
No!
I should learn to
shut my big mouth.
I mean, here I am, blathering
on about drugs and prostitutes.
Prostitutes?!
You never said anything
about prostitutes.
And I'm not going to.
Frankly...
I don't want to be
on his bad side.
Edie, I can't have someone
like that in my house.
I have to tear
up this lease.
Oh, no, I can't
let you do that!
Not with your arthritis.
Here.
You let me.
Gaby!
Susan!
Julie told me about Ian.
I am so sorry.
You must be devastated.
Hey, Gaby.
I see you've picked
up the pieces.
We got engaged last night.
We're getting married!
Oh, my God!
Congratulations!
So forget what Julie told you
about the wedding being off.
It's back on.
Really?!
Same day?
Yep! I promised people a wedding,
and they are getting one.
Well, I'm sorry.
I can't make it.
I have plans that day.
Oh, you could
change your plans.
No, I really can't.
Well, what could be more important
to you than my wedding?
My wedding?
What?
Oh, I see you got
the invitation!
You're getting married
on my wedding day?
Well, you canceled, and
Victor was kind of in a rush
because he didn't think it'd look good
for the mayor to be shacking up.
And every day we tried,
someone had a conflict.
And then your date opened up,
and we knew all my friends
were available, and, well...
You know, you, too.
It's really no problem.
We'll find another date.
Gaby, did you really think I would want to
spend what would've been my wedding day
watching someone
else get married?
I am so throwing that
bouquet to you!
Okay, if you think
for one second...
It's fine. Really.
Come on, Susan.
We got some
calls to make.
Oh, right!
I have to cancel my wedding...
again!
Susan. Hi.
Is this a bad time?
I'm kind of in the
middle of something.
Well, I just wanted to say that I'm sorry
for getting so snippy yesterday,
that when I canceled my wedding,
you had every right to...
Susan? Susan?
Is that my Susan?
Franois!
I am so sorry that I could not
do your wedding flowers.
But the moment
you canceled,
your friend here, she,
uh... how you say?
Scoop me up.
You stole my florist?
Only because
I admire your taste.
It's not theft.
It's an homage.
I left the bouquet and the
centerpiece on the table.
If there are any changes,
you let me know.
Au revoir.
Well, I gotta go.
I wanna see those flowers.
Oh, my God,
that's my centerpiece!
Oh, what, now you suddenly have
the trademark on peach tulips?
In this town in wedding
season? Yeah, I do.
You might as well have used
my caterer and my swing band.
Yeah. Listen, about that...
Oh, my God.
Did you steal my
whole wedding?
It was short notice, okay?
These people are booked
months in advance.
The only people available
were thones you just bailed on.
Gaby, I spent months
planning that wedding.
I see what
you're getting at.
And you know what?
You are right.
You have been my de facto wedding
planner, and you deserve to get paid.
All right, what's the going
rate? $7, 000? $8, 000?
Gaby...
All right, $10, 000.
I'm not gonna haggle.
I don't want to be paid.
I want my wedding back.
Well, you can't have it.
And if you ask me, I am
doing you a really big favor.
Excuse me?
You are rushing into this
marriage thing way too fast.
Why don't you give it some time and
see if you and me work as a couple?
I'm rushing?
You met Victor three months ago.
I've known Mike three years.
Yeah, on and off.
Mostly off.
What if you tie the
knot in a month
and realize that you miss Ian
and Mike misses the coma?
I cannot believe that
you just said that.
Okay, you know what?
I came over here to give
you my response card.
But here. This is my response.
You don't mean that.
That's just a big dramatic gesture.
No. No, this is a big
dramatic gesture.
My flowers!
No. They're my flowers!
Enjoy your stolen wedding!
You can't do this!
I just signed a lease!
I'm sorry. The law says my Mom
has 72 hours to change her mind.
She's exercising that option.
Hey! What's going on?
I've been evicted.
What?
Yeah. That was
Mrs. Sims' kid.
She's giving me 24 hours
to move out of her house.
That is so weird.
It gets weirder.
He told me Mrs. Sims is praying
for my spiritual recovery.
Well, when old folks see the end
coming, they get all religious.
I guess.
So mind if I crash with you
until I can find a new place?
Of course not.
Thanks. I'll bring my stuff
over in the morning.
Why wait? I've got
boxes in the garage.
I'll help you start
packing now.
Edie...
Did you have something
to do with this?
What?
You have to admit, it is
kind of a coincidence.
You ask me to move in,
I say no, I get evicted.
How dare you.
I offer to put a roof
over your head,
and you repay me with
suspicions and insults?
I don't even know that
I want you in my house.
Fine. I'll get a motel.
Oh, whoa! Hold on.
Let's not be hasty.
I knew it.
You were behind this.
Okay.
If you wanna fight, fine.
But let's talk about
the real issue here.
I mean, why are you so reluctant
to make a commitment to me?
I told you. I don't want
to talk about this.
Well, you never do,
but you owe me an explanation.
I mean, why don't you want
to move in with me?
Because I'm not
in love with you.
Edie, I'm sorry.
I really like you...
No, I get it.
It's just a little
upsetting because...
I'm late.
Edie, you can't be pregnant.
You're on the pill.
Yeah, well, I might've forgotten
to take it a couple of days,
and I've been nauseous
for an entire week,
so I went and got
a pregnancy test.
I figure I should find out
if I'm carrying your love child.
Wait, my mistake.
Your like child.
So? What does it say?
It's gonna take a couple
more minutes.
I just peed on that. For God sake,
put it on a coaster.
This is just dandy.
I'm 40, single,
and knocked up.
But on the bright side,
the Dad's not into me.
Edie, if you are pregnant, I'm not
gonna let you go through this alone.
So what, you're gonna be
my lamaze partner?
No. I'm saying I'll step up.
I'll be there to help you raise him.
You serious?
Hey, I was there practically every
day to help you with Travers.
What makes you think that I would do
any less if it were actually my child?
Well, thanks. That's...
nice to know.
You know...
Your spare bedroom...
would make a great nursery.
Yeah. I guess it would.
I mean, it's right down the
hall from the master,
so we'd be able to hear him
when he was crying.
"We"?
You'd move in?
I told you that I would
be here for you.
We could even decorate his room
in, like, a whole pirate theme.
I always wanted to do
that if I had a son.
You know what would
be really cool?
Decorate his bed like a ship,
with a sail and a mast...
Carlos?
It's negative.
Well, that's a relief, huh?
Yeah.
We really dodged a bullet.
So...
Let's celebrate, have a drink.
Oh, and by the way,
you're still welcome to stay
till you find a place.
That's nice of you.
Thanks.
I cannot thank you
enough for doing this.
Thanks for taking the
time out of your day.
Yeah, Tom, I'm not sure
this is the best approach.
I mean, I've never done a session
before where half of the couple
didn't know I was
a marriage counselor.
We'll tell her... eventually.
I just don't wanna
scare her off.
Hey, Lynette.
Yeah?
Look who just walked in off
the street, Scott McKinney.
Remember? We pledged alpha
tau together. I told you about him.
You won the beer
pong championship?
You told her about that?
Yeah, and then you
threw up in the trophy.
Well, that is far from his only
accomplishment. He's got a PHD.
Oh, wow. Well, I'd love to chat,
but I have cheese to grate.
Honey, no, wait, please.
I will do that later.
I want you guys...
to know each other.
I mean, this guy... is my boy.
So Scott got married the
same year that we did.
How's your wife
liking Fairview?
Well, her whole family's back east,
so she kind of resisted the move.
Really?
So that was
a source of conflict?
Yes. Well, all couples
have their conflicts.
I'm sure you've
had your share.
Oh, sure, now and then.
Emphasis on "now. "
Tom...
Scott shared with us.
We're going through
kind of a rough patch.
I see.
Well, I'm sure it's something
you will get through.
The trick is to keep those lines
of communication open.
Boy. Easier said than done.
So this rough patch...
what would you say is the
underlying issue there?
Well, scott, I'm not
sure I would say,
particularly not to
someone I just met.
He's just trying to help.
If you ask me,
I'd say it started when
our manager, Rick, quit.
Okay, and how did that
make you feel, Lynette?
I am not answering that.
This is not a therapy session.
But if it were, what...
What would you say?
Oh, dear God, you didn't.
Didn't what?
Okay, okay.
Give it up, Tom.
Yes. Yes, Lynette,
I am a couples counselor.
Really? And what do you
call this, ambush therapy?
It was my idea. Look,
I'm just trying to get you
to talk about
what is going on.
And don't tell me that
nothing's going on!
No, no. Good, good.
All our cards are on the table.
Cram it!
Okay, yeah, Tom,
I've been unhappy lately.
I am working through some issues, but
that is something I need to do on my own.
Talking about it doesn't help. Not to you,
and certainly not to Dr. beer pong.
Well, I'm bilding you
for a whole hour, so,
is there anything else
on your mind?
I mean, I'm sorry, but this time,
Gaby has just crossed the line,
and I will not make myself
sit through her wedding.
Julie thinks I'm overreacting.
You don't think I'm
overreacting, do you?
Yeah, a little.
Absolutely not.
What? She asked.
Look, even if Gaby
is in the wrong here...
And she is hugely,
hideously wrong...
Do you really want to
boycott her wedding?
She said that I would make Mike
wish he was back in a coma.
I think her point... and again, I wish she'd
express herself a little more tactfully...
was that marriage is unpredictable.
We can't know what it'll be until we're in it.
Don't defend that
self-centered brat.
She steals Susan's wedding and
then expects to stay friends.
She divorces Carlos and doesn't
want anyone else to date him.
I've never known anyone
as dishonest and manipulative.
Speaking of Carlos,
I hear he got evicted.
Yeah, that was
a real shocker.
Anyway, you stick
to your guns,
and don't you dare
go to that wedding.
It could ruin your friendship.
Are you willing to take that chance?
No, I guess not.
Wuss.
Well, at least get her a
thoughtless, crappy gift,
like a blender.
I got you a blender
for Christmas.
And I use it every day.
Gotta go.
Honey, I am so sorry.
I hope you don't hate me.
I don't. I was just on my
way to apologize to you.
Just so you know,
I changed all my flowers.
You don't have to.
The hell I don't. Those peach
tulips belong to you...
and so do these.
Thank you. I was just
bringing you this.
Well, we got chocolate and
wine. Your place or mine?
Oh, well...
I'm so glad we're doing this.
I hate it when we fight.
Me, too, and I'm so sorry about
that comment I made about Mike.
It was way out of line.
You guys are gonna
be insanely happy.
I think so, too.
But, you know,
then I remember,
that's what I thought
about me and Karl.
Please. Mike is not Karl.
Well, you know, when I married
him, Karl wasn't Karl.
And I think that's why
I got so mad at you.
Because 99% of me is sure that
we're gonna be totally happy.
But then what you said,
it just stirred up that pesky 1%.
Honey, please. If anyone
should be nervous, it's me.
I met Victor three months ago.
I mean, I'm crazy about him.
It's just, the thought of saying
those vows again? That's scary.
Lynette is right.
You know, marriage is like...
It's like these bonbons.
You never know what you're getting
until you're in the middle of it.
It's one of those
hard jelly ones.
Do you think
that's an omen?
Honey, you're
gonna be okay.
All right? We're gonna help
each other through this.
Right. Yeah.
And getting
married is scary,
but at least we'll be
doing it together.
Oh, my God!
We should totally do that!
What?
Get married together!
You and me?
Well, I'm beyond flattered.
I find you to be an incredibly
attractive woman. I just...
Oh, no, stupid.
I mean, a double wedding!
I would love that!
Yeah, and then you wouldn't
be mad at me for the date,
and I wouldn't feel guilty.
And we could be brides together!
Oh, yes! Let's celebrate.
More chocolate.
And just so you know, if I was
a lesbian, I'd totally do you.
That's good to know.
It's a fact of life
that brides-to-be
who agree to double
weddings late at night
often feel differently
come the dawn.
This change of heart
was certainly true
in the case of Susan Mayer...
And even more so...
for Gabrielle Solis.
Morning.
Hi, honey.
I hope I didn't wake you last night.
I was at Susan's till midnight.
Is something wrong?
No, not exactly. Just a...
small change of plans
about the wedding.
What kind of change?
See...
Susan was really upset...
I mean, I've never seen Gaby
so torn up with guilt.
Practically in tears over this
whole wedding date thing.
And she kept saying, "Please,
let me make it up to you!"
So after an hour of this,
I suddenly heard myself say...
"Hey, how about
a double wedding?"
Wanted to bite my tongue
the minute it came out.
She's so excited, so needy.
Jumping up and down
and hugging me.
I mean, what could I say?
So we're kind stuck.
So what do you think?
I think anything that makes
you happy is fine by me.
Will this make you happy?
No.
I'm screwed.
I cannot get out of this without
hurting her feelings.
Maybe this'll help...
I forbid it.
You do?
Sure.
Tell her that your groom's
an old-fashioned guy
and he doesn't want to see anybody
on that altar but his bride.
If she gets mad, have
her take it up with me.
So this is what
marriage is about?
Having someone
to hide behind?
So what do you think?
You're gonna
have to undo this.
How?
Look, I know I shouldn't
have offered, but I did.
I can't just take it back.
Well, you're gonna have to.
Do you have any idea what
this day means to me?
I do, and I know you've worked really
hard to make our wedding perfect.
Exactly. Do you think
I want to share it
with your friend and
her ex-convict fianc?
That's your problem?
Gaby, I'm the mayor
of this town.
How's it gonna look?
There'll be press there.
Press? At our wedding?
Well, we're public figures.
So all of this planning
and attention to detail,
that's all been
about your image?
Of course not. Gaby, this is gonna
be the proudest day of my life,
and I'm not sharing
the spotlight with anyone.
How about the bride?
Oh, please.
Every eye in that place
is gonna be on you.
Every woman will wish they were you.
Every guy will wish they had you.
It's gonna be great.
Tell your friends
you're sorry.
Tell 'em I'll even pay
for their wedding.
But they're not
sharing mine.
Here's a one-bedroom at the Oaks
with a view of the golf course.
That's gonna go fast.
You know, I'm gonna call on
this first thing in the morning.
Or, I know this is the last thing
you'd expect to hear from me, but...
What if...
you stayed here with me,
and we tried to
have a baby?
What, you're serious?
Well, I saw the look on your face
when that test came back negative.
Admit it.
You were disappointed.
Yeah, maybe a little.
Well...
So was I.
You were?
Yeah, I was.
You know, having Travers
here made me realize that...
I like being a Mom. And
you're so great with him.
Well, think...
We could have
that all the time.
Edie, nobody wants
a kid more than me.
It's just...
Yeah, yeah, we're not
head over heels in love.
We like each other, right?
I mean, that's more than a lot of
parents have going for them.
It's... just a very big step.
Carlos, look around.
Everyone's taking big steps.
Gaby and Victor,
Susan and Mike.
And this could be our step.
And we both need
to love someone.
No one said it had
to be each other.
Just think about it.
Let's do it.
You really want to?
Yeah.
I'm tired of waiting
for my life to start.
Oh, Carlos!
Imagine, with your
genes and mine,
that child is gonna
be a knockout!
I'm gonna brush my teeth, I'm gonna
flush those birth control pills,
and we're gonna get crackin'.
Hey!
Hey!
How are you doing?
Good.
Listen. We need to talk.
I spoke to Mike, and, uh,
he's just not really into the
whole double wedding thing.
Mike said no?
Yeah, he sort of wants the
day just to be about us.
So we're gonna
wait till the fall.
I'm so sorry.
No, it's okay.
Victor was kind of on
the fence about it, too.
Oh, good! I mean,
not that they said no, just...
'Cause I really wanted to do it.
Me, too.
I think it would've
been so much fun.
Yeah.
Well, I gotta go.
I'm gonna meet Franois.
See ya.
Oh, by the way...
You know that 1% sliver of a doubt
thing I told you about? Totally gone.
Any question I had about
Mike's been answered.
That must feel
really great.
Yeah.
I feel really
good about this.
I do, too.
Our friends are probably
gonna make fun of us.
Yeah, I'm sure.
But who cares?
It's gonna be great.
I'm so happy we're
gonna be living together.
We're gonna have
so much fun.
I'll be right out.
Okay...
Let's make a baby.
I talked to my back
doctor today.
What did he have to say?
He said, assuming I exercise
reasonable caution,
I can have sex again.
And what would that
have to do with me?
Well, you don't seem to want
to talk to me these days
so I figured it's the one thing that
we can do together without speaking.
Remember when I was giving birth
to the twins and screaming in agony
because Porter was dragging
my uterus out with him?
Well, I was more in the mood
for sex then than I am now.
Lynette?
I'm your husband. I have to find
a way to connect to you somehow.
So we can have sex
or we can talk.
Your call.
Fine.
Let's have sex.
What?
Yeah. Let's get this off.
You would rather have sex
with me than talk to me?
Yep!
Ow, that hurts.
I said I'd have sex.
I didn't say I'd make love.
You wanna play rough?
'Cause I could play rough.
Cut it out!
Sorry. I'll try to be gentler
as I move down south.
Okay. Okay!
Okay, fine!
You are mad at me.
But name one thing that
I have done to deserve it!
You had lunch with Rick.
You're damn right I did.
I saw the security tape.
What was I supposed to do,
pretend that nothing was going on?
Nothing was going on!
He never touched me!
And I wasn't gonna sit around
and wait until he did!
I am glad that
I made him quit!
You didn't make him
quit, I fired him!
You what?
The idiot told me he had feelings for me,
which he never would've done
if you hadn't pushed him, and
now he's gone. It's all your fault.
My back!
Lynette?
Honey?
It'll just be a few more
minutes, Mrs. Scavo.
The doctor's looking
at your C.A.T. scan.
Thank you.
This whole thing is ridiculous.
I bumped my head.
Lynette, you were dizzy
and throwing up.
You can't be too careful.
Well, I feel just fine now.
When Rick said he
had feelings for you,
what did you say?
I said that it was totally inappropriate,
and then I fired him.
Do you have feelings
for him, Lynette?
Do you have feelings for Rick?
I would never cheat on you.
You know that.
That's not what I asked.
Did you fall for him?
Oh, God.
Nothing happened.
He's gone. It's over.
Don't tell me that it's over. We've
been fighting about this all week.
You miss him, don't you?
Don't do this.
Damn.
Not now. I can't.
Mrs. Scavo?
That's me.
I'll be back.
Actually, I'd... rather have
you both come in for this.
Is it a concussion?
No, it's just a bruise.
Well, good.
But I noticed something in your
C.A.T. scan that concerns me.
You have a few swollen
lymph nodes in your neck.
I wanna send you
in for a biopsy.
A biopsy? Why?
Have you noticed any change
in your appetite lately?
Any fatigue, fevers...
Stop. Just... stop.
What is it you
think I have?
I don't want you to panic.
This can be any
number of things.
Is one of them cancer?
It could be lymphoma.
We're hoping the biopsy
will rule that out.
If you look at
the C.A.T. scan...
you can see this white
area here stands out.
These are called
submandibular lymph nodes.
Lymphoma can vary according
to the type of cell that multiplies
and how the cancer
presents itself.
There are two types.
Hodgkin's and
non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
From the moment we
wake up in the morning,
till our head hits
the pillow at night,
our lives are filled
with questions.
Is it morning yet?
Most are easily answered
and soon forgotten.
Not yet, sweetheart.
You go back to sleep now.
But some questions
are much harder to ask
because we're so
afraid of the answer.
"Will I be around to watch
my children grow up?"
"Am I making a mistake
by marrying this man?"
"Could he ever
truly love me?"
And what happens when
we ask ourself the hard question,
and get the answer
we'd been hoping for?
Well, that's when
happiness begins.
Previously on Desperate Housewives...
Victor made himself
perfectly clear...
Whenever I've truly
wanted something,
I've always gotten it.
Bree needed to get away...
We're finally taking
our honeymoon.
Susan couldn't wait
to pop the question...
Will you marry me?
Lynette received
shocking news...
You can see this.
It could be lymphoma.
Why are you so reluctant to
make a commitment to me?
Because I'm not
in love with you.
And Edie...
What if we tried
to have a baby?
Engaged in
a dangerous deception.
When Gabrielle Solis agreed
to marry Victor Lang,
she was determined to have
a very traditional wedding.
She was even more determined
to be a very traditional bride.
To that end, the handkerchief
in her cleavage was borrowed,
the garter on
her leg was blue,
and the diamonds on
her ears were old.
But sadly for Gabrielle,
something was missing,
and she was about to
throw a traditional fit.
It is after 3:00!
Where the hell is Bree
with my "something new"?!
I know her plane landed on time.
She'll probably be here any second.
God, I should have my head
examined for even agreeing to this.
Who the hell cares about
Swiss jewelry anyway?
Gaby, Bree went out of her way
to buy you that bracelet.
And, of course, it's the
hottest day of the year.
All the guests are out
there sweating like pigs.
God, at this rate,
my reception's gonna look like the
finish line of the Boston marathon.
If you're that freaked out,
just get married without the bracelet.
Are you out of your mind?!
I can't get married without
my "something new. "
I have an idea.
I just got a lipstick yesterday.
You could wear that.
I just paid a makeup artist
500 bucks to do my face.
Do you really think I wanna march down
the aisle looking like just ate a popsicle?
Okay, it's your big day,
so I'm gonna let that slide.
God, it is 10 after,
and Bree is never late!
Where can she be?
All right, that's it.
After I finish "tszujing" my hair,
tell the preacher it's showtime.
I can't believe my wedding's already
ruined, and it hasn't even started.
Hey, I'm starting to get
worried about Bree.
Maybe we should call.
Yeah. I'm calling her cell.
It's ringing.
Oh, good.
Bree!
Hello, ladies.
Is that Bree? She better not
have come empty-handed!
Oh, I didn't.
As promised, Bree had arrived
with something new.
Holy crap!
And she also...
brought the bracelet.

Family.
There is nothing
more important.
They're the ones we want to laugh
with during the good times...
and the ones we need to
console us during the bad.
And even though the time comes
when they have to leave us,
their voices still linger
in our minds.
And sometimes
we can't help but listen.
A tangled web,
that's what you're weaving.
Beat it, mother.
You really think this little scheme
of yours is gonna work?
Of course it will.
Look at him. He's...
practically in love
with me already.
That's because he thinks
you're gonna give him a baby.
Wait till he finds out
you're still on the pill.
Shut up, would you?!
I just thank the good Lord your
father didn't live to see this.
Well, neither did you.
You died alone in a trailer park
watching game shows.
And why should
I listen to you?
'Cause I know what's
waiting for you, missy.
This one's gonna leave
you like all the others.
You're going to end up old
and alone, just like I did.
Carlos?
Carlos!
Down here, babe!
I'm making you
a fruit smoothie.
Chicken or fish?
What?
I haven't gotten your reply card
back yet. So chicken or fish?
Oh! Right,
your wedding.
I can't go.
Why not?
I'm a jinx.
I went to your last wedding,
and look how that turned out.
Come on, Gaby. We both
know it'd be weird if I went.
Okay, maybe a little, but
it'll be weirder if you don't.
Excuse me?
Look, everyone knows
you're living with Edie.
If she shows up alone, people will
think I asked her not to bring you,
like it bugs me that
you guys are together.
But it does bug you.
You hit the roof when you found out.
Which is why I have to show
people that I'm okay with it.
Please, just consider it
my wedding gift.
Okay, but I'm skipping
the ceremony.
What?!
And just go to the reception?
You can't do that.
I don't want
to make a scene.
You'll vow,
"till death do us part,"
I'll bust out laughing,
people will stare...
Reception starts at 4:00.
I'm thinking a chocolate fountain
would be a cool centerpiece
to a dessert buffet.
Dessert buffet?
We're having
a wedding cake, right?
Isn't that dessert?
Yeah, but you have to
give people a choice.
Don't you think a chocolate
fountain would be elegant?
I don't know. You, a big white
dress, melted chocolate.
Am I the only one
hearing alarm bells?
Fine, we'll skip
the chocolate.
How about a champagne
fountain? Oh, I know!
Maybe we can make the champagne
flow through the ice sculpture.
Don't you think we might be
going a little over-the-top?
Mike, these are all fairly
standard wedding features.
Now you name one thing that
you think is going over-the-top.
How about the dove wrangler?
Well, the doves are not going
to release themselves.
Do we really need 40 of 'em?
Okay, I know that
you think I'm being silly,
but all of our friends went to Bree's
wedding, and now they're going to Gaby's.
Two months from now, do we really
want them thinking our wasn't as nice?
It seems to me our friends wouldn't
be there to make petty comparisons.
They'd be there to
celebrate our love.
You would think
that, but no.
Come on.
This is something that we have
both looked forward to for so long.
Don't you want it
to be perfect?
Oh, I guess.
About the doves, though...
What?
You in a wedding gown,
40 birds circling overhead?
Again, not liking
those odds.
It's not as bad
as it sounds.
It's Hodgkin's lymphoma,
and apparently,
if you're going to get lymphoma,
that's the kind you want.
Hey, you wanna hold it
down up there, kids?
I'm trying to talk to
your aunt Lucy!
Thank you!
Anyway, I know I said that we would
come and visit you this June,
but I'll be a little woozy and...
bald from the chemo, so...
Thanks for understanding.
Oh, one more thing.
Our insurance policy has
a really high deductible,
so we are strapped financially,
and I was wondering if maybe
you and Dave might be able to...
Oh, really?
No, I am not asking Mom.
She doesn't know about any of this,
so don't you tell her, okay?
We'll be fine.
I love you.
Bye.
I take it that's a "no"
on the loan?
Yep.
Dave lost his job
at the plant,
and he is now handing out flyers
at a chicken restaurant, and...
prepare to wince,
there is a chicken suit involved.
So where are we gonna
find this $10, 000?
You leave that to me.
I want you to focus
on getting better.
But, honey...
I will find it.
Meanwhile, we'll make some
sacrifices around here.
My tennis club membership
is up this month.
I'm not renewing.
Should you even be playing
tennis after your back surgery?
Probably not.
Well, in that spirit,
as soon as I start chemo,
I will be giving up shampoo.
Okay, thanks.
Taxi's here.
Are you sure you're
ready to go back?
We could wait
another week.
And miss Gaby's wedding?
No, I'll be fine.
Is this the dress you were
thinking for the ceremony?
Yes.
Oh, good.
I'll fold it in tissue
so it doesn't wrinkle.
Oh, darling,
I don't deserve you.
Oh, come on.
We agreed, no more tears.
I'm so sorry to be
putting you through this.
I wouldn't blame you if you ran
like hell and never looked back.
Stop.
I'm going to raise this child and
love it as if it were my own.
Now let's see a smile.
Well, I'm glad you
could join us, Milton.
It's good to get to know
you before the wedding.
Thank you.
You know, I must say,
all these months, I thought Victor
was exaggerating about you.
But he hasn't
done you justice.
You, my dear,
are a flawless beauty.
I'm hardly flawless.
I'm sure I have a blemish
hidden away somewhere.
Now that's a search
I would relish.
She is way out of
your league, Dad.
Honey, he's a multimillionaire.
He runs my league.
By the way, Victor, I...
ran into Keith
Perkinson last week.
And how is the venerable
state chairman?
Impressed with you.
He liked the way you ran
your mayor campaign,
said if you keep
your numbers up,
he might consider supporting
you in the next governor's race.
Really?
What's so funny?
You gotta be kidding, right?
I mean, we just
finished a campaign.
You're not about to put
me through another one.
But I thought
you loved campaigning.
God, no.
It's a complete snore.
Pasting a smile on my face while you
say the same speech for the 50th time?
But you were a natural.
People loved you.
Well, the feeling
wasn't mutual.
You think I enjoyed
sipping tea with these
frumpy matrons who wore
loud, polyblend pantsuits?
You know how many times
I just wanted to scream,
"Vote for my husband,
you color-blind cow!"?
I think you've discovered something very
important about democracy, my dear.
The nation is full of fools,
and everyone gets a vote.
Well, they're not
gonna get us again.
I made nice with Fairview.
I'm not about to suck up
to the whole damn state.
What are you doing?
Some guy out in Mount Pleasant's
got a cracked water heater.
It's 3:00 in the morning.
Well, I started advertising
as a 24-hour plumber.
After midnight,
I get triple time.
Okay, well, that's crazy.
You can't work round
the clock. It's not healthy.
Well, this is the third night
I've worked this week.
I'm fine so far.
You've been sneaking out
while I've been asleep?
What are you,
ninja plumber?
It's just for a little while,
earn some extra money.
Is this about the wedding?
We agreed we want it
to be nice.
But we didn't
agree on this.
Maybe I can scale
things back a bit.
How?
Have a ginger ale fountain?
Make paper doves
and hope it's windy?
Okay, seriously, you don't
have to kill yourself.
I could max out
my credit card.
Is that really how you want to
start our life together, in debt?
No, I wanna start out happy.
But clearly, you're upset,
and I don't know why.
I'm not Ian.
I can't afford to move
you into a mansion,
or fly you off to Paris,
but I'll be damned
if I don't give you
the same dream wedding
he would have given you.
I'll see you
in the morning.
I'm drawing pictures of trees.
Where the hell do you
get off having cancer
and not telling
me about it?!
Mom...
How do you think you could
handle this without me?
Stella?
Oh, there's my Tommy boy!
Come here!
God.
Listen, be a love, will you, honey,
and get my bags from the cab?
Bags?
She's staying?
Yep.
And do not tip the driver.
S.O.B. wouldn't
let me smoke.
Jeez, Lynette, I didn't know
you opened a day care center.
Hey, kids, Grandma's here.
Okay, what did you
tell them about me?
It's been five years, Mom.
They don't remember you.
Well, they'll remember me
this time. I brought presents.
Cool!
Hey...
For you,
and you,
and you.
These are baby toys.
We're too old
to play with these.
Well, I'm too old to remember what
the hell 6-year-olds like to play with.
We're 8.
What do I care?
Just say thank you.
Thank you.
Who's the pretty thing?
Your girlfriend?
No!
She's my sister!
Is that Tom's
little B-A-S-T-A...
Okay, kids, time to get your
toys and let's play upstairs.
Come on, Penny.
Come on, sweetie.
Let's go, everybody.
Listen, Mom, I really
appreciate you coming to help,
but as you can see,
I'm perfectly fine.
For now.
Now how you gonna handle that mob
when you're flat on your ass from chemo?
I'll manage.
You got through breast cancer
while raising the three of us alone.
I was not alone.
I had you.
Lynette was all of 13, and she
still looked after her sisters,
cleaned the house,
cooked the meals,
and I was curled up in a ball,
puking my guts out.
Well, that's what you get when
you mix chemo and vodka gimlets.
You can goad me
all you like, Lynette.
I did not come
here to fight.
Now trust me, cookie,
I have memorized the
whole catalog of subjects
you and I can
no longer discuss,
and if that means that we have
to talk about the weather
for three months, then fine.
But I am staying.
Now...
If you'll excuse me, I have to go
kick a child out of its room.
Okay.
Legs up!
You wanna do it again?
No.
I've been doing
a lot of research,
and gravity helps facilitate
the sperm reaching the eggs.
So...
Heave-ho!
Well, could we try
a little light spooning
before you hang me up
like a side of beef?
Edie, we're trying
to have a baby.
Well, could we be
a little less clinical?
Maybe let nature
take its course?
Nature is not on
our side anymore.
Look, you're no
spring chicken,
and those eggs aren't
exactly farm-fresh.
Okay, stop referring
to me as poultry.
Sorry.
Can we just try this?
It's only for 30 minutes.
30 minutes?!
I am not staying in this
position for a half an hour.
Listen, I know that this
requires some work,
but it will all be worth it when we
have our beautiful, beautiful baby.
Right?
Right.
I guess I could...
make some sacrifices.
That's my girl.
Can I get you anything?
Yeah. I'd kill for a beer.
Sorry. No alcohol.
What?! For how long?
Just until the baby's born.
Oh, and you stop nursing.
Don't worry. I'll get you
a nice herbal tea.
It's just for a few months
while you're in treatment.
We're gonna have to find
someone to watch the kids.
No!
I am not leaving that woman
in charge of our children.
In three months, the twins
will be chain-smoking, and
Penny will be an alcoholic.
We can manage.
We've got McCluskey.
She costs money.
Money that we won't have
if we're paying someone
to replace you at work.
You said not to worry about money,
that you'd find it somewhere.
I did.
What, someone
loaned us $10, 000?
No, gave us,
and we can't thank her
by kicking her out.
No! Tom, you didn't
ask my mother?!
Didn't have to.
She knew that you hit up
Lucy, so she offered.
Well, we're giving it back.
No, we can't afford to.
Tom, you don't know half
the stuff she did to us.
She would get drunk
and smack us around.
She would meet some new
guy and then drop us off
at her sister's for a week
because he wasn't into kids.
So she was a crappy Mom.
You said yourself
that she has mellowed.
Now she wants
to make amends.
If you would just
try to understand...
I think that I've been
pretty understanding lately.
What's that supposed to mean?
I think you know.
Great, so in the middle of
everything I'm dealing with,
you're gonna throw
Rick in my face.
When someone we love hurts us,
if we still love them,
we deal with it
and we move on.
If I can do it,
so can you.
So forgiving my mother...
that's my penance?
Yeah.
I think it is.
I thought you said we weren't supposed to
spend the night before the wedding together.
Yeah, I was trying
to respect tradition...
but I got horny.
Well, I guess we'll just have to start
the honeymoon early, won't we?
Let me get rid
of this stuff.
What are you
working on so late?
Nothing.
Polling data?
Why are you polling?
The election's over.
It's just a little research.
God, you look hot.
Is this about running
for governor?
Because I told you
how I feel about that.
My Dad just set up a little
exploratory committee.
It's no big deal.
Okay, well,
let's explore it now.
Nope, not gonna happen.
Gaby...
Victor, ever
since we met,
it's been photo ops and
fund-raisers, and I'm sick of it.
Well, I'm a politician.
Do you think I want my career
to begin and end in the suburbs?
Fairview is my home,
and I don't want to leave it.
And you can't make this
decision without me.
I'm gonna be your wife.
Exactly, not my
career adviser.
Oh, so I don't
even get a vote?
Not if it's a veto.
Okay, look, no!
I already married a man who
put his career before me,
and I swore I wasn't
gonna do it again.
Well, I swore I would not let
a stupid woman hold me back.
That did not come out
the way I wanted it to.
I'm sorry.
I'm so... I'm really sorry.
I've just been under
a lot of pressure lately.
Well, here's one less thing
you have to worry about:
our wedding.
You can't cancel the wedding.
It's too late.
As far as I'm concerned,
it's just in the nick of time.
Good morning, Gaby.
God, Milton, the newspaper's
not even here yet.
I'm sorry it's
so early. I just...
came to apologize.
Why? What happened
wasn't your fault.
That's not exactly the case.
Is that coffee I smell?
You only bolted because
Victor wants to be governor.
He only wants to be
governor because of me.
You only suggested it.
You can't make him go after
something he doesn't want.
The hell I can't.
Ever since he was a kid,
Victor's been
killing himself trying to live up
to his big shot father.
He's desperate
for my approval.
Why?
I suppose because
he's never gotten it.
Everything he does,
even becoming mayor,
I somehow let him know
that it's not quite enough.
Don't get me wrong.
I'm right to push.
That's why
he's so successful.
So what are you saying,
I should marry Victor
because you're
a withholding father?
No, I just want you to understand
why he does what he does.
Fine. I get it.
But why would I want a husband who values
his father's opinion more than mine?
Well, he doesn't really care
much what I think anymore.
After you left last night, he called me
and... what's the phrase?
"Tore me a new one"?
He did?
He said because of me, he'd lost the best
thing that had ever happened to him,
and if he couldn't
win you back,
I could take my money
and buy a new son,
because I was never gonna
be hearing from him again.
He blew off $80 million?
Well, if he cares about
me so damn much,
why am I not hearing
this from him?
I think you're about to.
Is there a back
way out of here?
Aren't you gonna be late
for Gaby's wedding?
Oh, weddings are boring.
I like to sneak
in at the end,
look teary-eyed and pretend
I was there the whole time.
I am gonna see you
at the reception.
Uh, hi, Danny.
Carlos, the paperboy's here.
Could you pay him?
Come on in.
Hey, here you go, Danny.
Looks like
I'm a little short.
Can I catch you later?
No.
Okay. Hold on.
Oh, my God.
What's that?
It's birth control pills.
I'm gonna need cash.
Welcome home!
I have missed you, sweetheart!
Here, allow me.
Well, hello there, Julie.
You guys are back!
Somebody's... blonder.
Yeah, my Mom hates it, too.
So where's Danielle?
Well, while we were in Switzerland,
she ran across this boarding school,
and she fell in love
with it and just insisted
that we let her spend
a year abroad.
She must be having
a really good time.
She hasn't returned
any of my phone calls.
Well, you know, her school's
up in the mountains,
and her cell phone
reception is kind of funky.
She hasn't answered
my e-mails, either.
Well, I am gonna call her tonight
and have a little talk with her
about common courtesy,
and I'm sure that you will get an e-mail
first thing tomorrow morning.
Well, we should go. I've got to get that
bracelet to Gaby before the wedding.
Well, I'll see you
guys there. Bye.
Well, that was uncomfortable.
You have no idea.
Everyone's been
asking questions.
This might not be as
easy as we'd hoped.
There. Now you have
something new.
So how do I look?
You are now officially the most
beautiful bride that ever lived.
Until your wedding, of course.
Nice save.
It means so much to me that
we're all here together right now.
And... break!
Love you.
We are gathered here today
to join together Victor Lang
and Gabrielle Marquez in matrimony.
An honorable estate not
to be entered in lightly,
but reverently and soberly.
This is a lifetime union,
one based on love,
honor and trust...
You wanna be
my new best friend?
Premium scotch.
Keep it coming.
You are promising not
only to give of yourself,
but also to accept each other,
promising not only
to love for today,
but to extend that
love to include...
Carlos!
I thought you weren't
coming until after...
Save it.
Okay, look,
I can explain...
Don't bother!
Your lies were more
convincing when I cared.
Victor, do you
take Gabrielle...
Carlos...
You've got to understand.
I do wanna have
a baby with you,
just not yet.
I... I just...
I wanted to give you a chance
to fall in love with me first.
I don't believe you, and
I will never trust you again!
Well, what was
I supposed to do?
You backed me
into a corner,
and you were
gonna bail on us,
and I was just trying
to save what we had.
Carlos, don't leave me.
Please just talk to me.
I am done with you.
Carlos!
Ladies a gentlemen,
I present to you
Mr. and Mrs. Victor Lang.
I'm sorry!
Mrs. McCluskey!
Enjoy the wedding?
Nice. Very classy.
Although what the hell was that
brouhaha between Carlos and Edie?
I don't know
and I don't care.
Today, I'm so filled with love,
I can forgive anyone anything.
But if you do see them
again, call security.
So we're in Zurich,
and I sick
after breakfast for the
third morning in a row.
And I thought to
myself, "Dear God,
I hope I have not developed
an allergy to chocolate brioche.
Life just wouldn't
be worth living. "
So I said, "That's it.
We're seeing a doctor. "
Well, you could've knocked
us over with a feather
when he said she was already
two months pregnant.
I think it's so great, and
we could not be happier for you.
When's your due date?
Oh, not until the early fall,
but enough about me.
This is your day, you and Victor,
who, by the way, I have not met yet.
Oh, my Gosh,
that's right.
Okay, you stay here.
I'm gonna go grab him.
It is so good to be back.
I can't believe how
much is happening.
I mean, you and Gaby
getting married, and
I'm having a baby.
What's going on
with you, Lynette?
Nothing.
Same old, same old.
Really? Is everything
okay, sweetie?
'Cause you haven't quite seemed
yourself the last couple weeks.
I'm fine. Everything's just fine.
I'll tell you this much,
I'm exhausted.
I'll be glad when
this day is over.
Well, it was all worth it.
Marrying Gaby is the smartest
thing you've ever done.
With her bringing in the latino vote,
the governor's mansion's as good as yours.
Well, that's assuming
I can change her mind.
I had to make certain concessions
just to get her down the aisle.
You're the husband now.
The rules have changed.
Be nice, buy her
a few pretty things.
Trust me, you'll be able
to tame that little spitfire.
I'm not too worried. I've always
been able to manage my assets.
Did you find him?
No, I'm still looking,
but I'll let you know.
Movie's over.
And may I add... amen.
Go out and play.
Go on, go on. Out!
They're just gonna
go play guns.
Can I watch another movie?
Lynette said one was the limit,
and she'll be home soon.
No, she won't.
Whenever they
go out to a party,
they always come home at least
an hour later than they say they will.
Aren't you an observant
little monkey?
Tell me, sweetie...
Would you know anything
about a man named Rick?
Yeah, I know Rick.
My Daddy and Lynette
had a big fight about him.
Really?
Sounds like there's
maybe a little story there.
If I tell you,
could I watcha really
good grown-up movie?
If it's a really good
grown-up story.
Okay, I got you some
appetizers to tide you over.
We have mini quiches
and beef satay
and something called
"crystal coast shrimp with grits,"
but it's mostly just grits 'cause
I ate all the shrimp on my way over.
Mike?
Reverend, that was such
a beautiful ceremony.
Really, just heartfelt and
moving, the whole package.
Well, thank you.
Yeah, it was
really impressive.
So what are you
doing tonight?
Oh, Carlos.
Didn't know
you were in here.
I got a little thirsty.
Yes.
I can see that.
Gaby, I am sorry if
I ruined your wedding.
But if it's any consolation,
I also ruined my life.
What are you talking about?
A couple years ago,
I was totally happy.
I had a home, you,
a great career.
And I don't understand
how I let it all go to hell.
And now here I am,
back at square one.
I really blew it.
Ah, what am I doing?
I shouldn't be dumping
this on you.
It's your wedding day.
Go to Victor.
I'm gonna stay
right here...
Well, I don't know
how you did it.
The kids are asleep, and the cough
syrup hasn't been touched.
Boy, you're just waiting for
an excuse to give me the boot.
Well, if history's any indicator,
I won't have to wait long.
So you don't think
people can change?
I think at a certain point,
people just are who they are.
Well, I think people
can change.
Now take you.
You were the perfect
wife and Mom...
then along came Rick.
How did you...
Come on, Lynette.
You kids were young when
I was sneaking around on Glen,
but you knew
something was up.
You heard about
this from my kids?
Just the girl.
And all she knows is that Daddy
got mad because Rick "liked" you.
Nothing happened
between me and Rick.
Yes, he came on to me,
but unlike you, I controlled myself.
Well, you had Tom
to come home to.
I had your stepfather.
Hey, Glen may have bored you,
but the years we had a father
in that house were
the happiest in my life.
You didn't care about that, though,
did you? You just drove him away.
And you couldn't wait
to pay me back.
Do you remember what you said
the next year when I got sick?
No I don't.
Liar.
You said I earned it.
It was God's punishment.
How are you feeling
now, Lynette?
You think you're
being punished?
How can you say that?
You were so sanctimonious.
You could not imagine what sort
of woman could do that kind of thing.
Not so hard to
imagine now, is it?
Stop comparing us.
I never did what you did.
No, you just wanted to.
You're leaving tomorrow.
I don't want your money.
I don't want you in my house.
Hey. You are sick, Lynette.
You think you know
what you're in for
'cause you watched
me go through it?
Watching it is nothing.
You are going to feel worse than
you thought a person could feel,
and I'll be holding your hand
through every damn minute.
You can't stay if
I don't want you here.
You can fight me or you
can fight the cancer.
Trust me,
you won't have the
strength to do both.
Andrew?
Do young people
still say "awesome"?
Not so much.
Try "off the hook. "
"Off the hook"?
That doesn't even make sense.
Fine, type in "groovy. "
See if I care.
Hello? Hodge residence.
Hi, Danielle. Listen, I am sending
Julie Mayer an e-mail from you.
Now would you say that your
school was "off the hook"?
No. I would say
it was sucky,
or crappy or
a freaking nightmare.
Look, if you're gonna start
complaining, I'm going to hang up.
Mom, you have got
to talk to the nuns.
They are so harsh with me,
and they have all these stupid rules.
Well, perhaps if some of those
rules had been in place
when you took up
with Edie's nephew,
you might not be
in this little pickle.
Mom, please,
I just wanna come home.
Look, I am gonna
say this one last time.
You are gonna stay put
until that baby is born.
Now don't forget,
we're driving up this weekend,
and I am bringing your favorite
lemon squares, and...
Darling,
can I draw you a bath?
That would be lovely.
Would you give me
a hand, please?
There you go.
It's almost time for
the 6-month size.
Don't remind me.
No. No, it's no problem.
I can fix that for you.
Just give me your
name and address.
I'm Mrs. Emmeline Walcott,
and I'm at 42 Old Mill road.
All right, I gotta stop and pick up
a douglas valve, but
I should be there
in 45 minutes tops.
I hate to see you drive
when you're this tired.
There's some iced
coffee in the fridge.
See you when I get back.
You were great.
Did you all ever doubt I would be?
Just hurry up and get dressed.
We only have 45 minutes.
Are you Mike?
Yeah.
I'm looking for a
Mrs. Walcott's house.
You've come
to the right place.
Here, put this on.
You mind telling me
what Susan's up to?
Ask her yourself.
Are you sure about this?
I don't want you
to look back and
regret not having
your perfect wedding.
Well, I don't know if you've
noticed, but my idea
of the perfect wedding
keeps changing.
One day, I want white roses,
and then I want lilies.
First, I want a harpist,
and then a string quartet.
Only one thing
stays constant...
and I'm looking at him.
Why would I need anything else
to make my wedding perfect?
Well, who knew downsizing
could be so romantic?
Yeah.
Mrs. Walcott, I presume?
That's right, sugar.
Oh, you might wanna check that
breast pocket of your suit.
And just so you know,
you'll be paying for those
and the lights and the flowers.
I've never seen you
look so beautiful.
You clean up pretty
good yourself.
Are we ready?
Are you kidding?
They've been dragging this
thing out for three years.
We are gathered here
today to join together
Mike Delfino and Susan
Mayer in matrimony.
An honorable estate not
to bentered into lightly,
but reverently and soberly...
Family.
There is nothing
more important.
They're the ones who show up
when we're in trouble...
The ones who push
us to succeed...
The ones who help
keep our secrets.
But what of those who have
no family to rely on?
What happens to
those poor souls...
who have no loved ones to help
them in their hour of need?
Well...
Most learn to walk life's
road by themselves.
But a sad few of us...
simply...
stop trying.
