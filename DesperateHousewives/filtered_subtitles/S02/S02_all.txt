previously on...
you're awfully brave buying place site unseen.
We could tell from the advertisement it was just what
we were looking for.
Sometimes...
who ever said you were the father?
Didn't you think it was strange that
you have the only lawn on wisteria lane
that needed to be mowed
three times a week?
I am going to kill you!
The truth about our loved ones...
you asked peterson's wife to make
sure he wouldn't promote me
so I quit. I'm gonna be a stay-at-home dad.
We should... talk about this.
You're goin' back to work.
Can lead you into harm's way.
I think I'm having a heart attack.
You are gonna come through
this operation just fine.
Hello?
Rex passed away about
ten minutes ago.
I'm so sorry.
Mr. Delfino took my dad away to kill him.
Now I'm gonna kill mr. Delfino.
It was an accepted fact among
the residents of Wisteria Lane
that Ida Greenberg liked her liquor.
People had seen her
drunk at sewing bees...
the department of motor vehicles...
and the first methodist church.
Ida had tried to quit
drinking many times,
but she couldn't.
Then one night in a moment of despair,
she challenged god
to quench her never-ending thirst.
Luckily for Ida, God was listening.
Zach, listen to me.
No!
Not so tough now,are you?
Uh! Ow! Oh! Bongo,no!
Bongo!Bongo!
It was at that moment it occurred to Ida
God may work in mysterious ways,
but he isn't particularly subtle.
It had been a year since my death,
and a lot had changed on Wisteria Lane.
children had learned new games.
New neighbors had moved in.
Old houses had been rebuilt...
I told you guys twice.
Okay, Craig,what's goin' on?
And fresh tragedies had occurred.
In one house,
a widow was getting ready to tell her friends of her husband's passing.
But until the time was right,
she would wait.
And life,as it tends to do,
would go on.
I look like hell. I need a hairbrush.
Yeah, um, that's not gonna help.
Susan,
officer Romslove is here for your statement.
Zach young do that?
No. She fell. Bit her lip.
It was an accident.
Okay.
So,uh,walk me through what happened.
well, I went over to mike's to feed the dog.
I'm sorry?
Feed the dog.
and I turned around,
and there was Zach young-
and that's Zach with an "h"-
pointing a gun at me.
The doctor said keep that in.
You gotta understand, Zach's had a tough time.
He's got emotional issues-
'cause he's crazy.
Still, I don't think he meant to hurt anybody.
Uh,hello! Uh,he was waiting
there for you to come home
so he could kill you.
Is that what happened when you got home?
The kid took a shot at you?
Actually, Susan fired the gun.
That's because I was
wrestling it away from Zach
so that he wouldn't shoot you.
Oh,there's blood.
Could we do this later?
She's kind of a mess right now.
Yeah, I think I can fill in the rest for you.
I'd appreciate it.
You feel better, mrs. Mayer.
Thanks.
Ow! That hurts.
I'm gonna get you more ice.
Okay.
No,I'm tellin' you.
Susan really flew off the handle
when she jumped the kid.
So you're saying this was
more of a domestic squabble?
Definitely, yeah.
Are we required to press charges?
Well,you're not really required,
but it's something you should really
consider when a handgun is involved.
John!
How did you get in here?
I know where you keep the key.
Mimosa?
No, I'm pregnant, you jackass.
I made yours with seltzer.
Do you have any idea what you've done?
That little stunt you pulled
yesterday in the courtroom
could get carlos sent away for eight years.
Yeah,I thought you might
be a little mad about that.
But once you calm down,
you'll see that it's just the two of us.
It's gonna be awesome.
you brought luggage?
He's gone. We don't have to sneak around anymore.
We can have a real relationship.
It's what's best for the three of us.
The three of us? How exactly does that benefit Carlos?
I'm talking about my baby.
You don't know it's your baby.
I don't even know it's your baby.
And I don't wanna know 'cause it doesn't matter.
so what,you don't love me?
Well, up until the point that you told my husband we were having an affair,
I was quite fond of you.
Since then...
not a fan!
Hey.
hey.
Oh,why on earth would you let them
finger paint before breakfast?
It's my job to clean that up now, so it's my call, right?
You're right. I'm sorry.
Hey, I thought the meeting wasn't until 1.
Oh, I have a thousand things to do before that-
borrow a decent scarf from bree,
buy a lipstick I don't hate-
mommy, mommy, look!
Aah! No! No!
No, nobody touches mommy, okay?
I love you, I love your finger painting,
but if you touch me with those messy hands,
I will cut them off.
Go on. Off. Good.
It's okay.
A little nervous?
Who, me?
I've been out of work for seven years,
I'm a woman of a certain age in a business that values youth above all else.
Why should I be nervous?
You are experienced.
You are brilliant.
You are going to nail this job interview, okay?
Thank you. Uh, no. I can't...
you're very... so...
Thank you. Here.
Oh, my cell phone.
Lynette, hi, it's Bree.
I do hope I'm not calling too early.
Hmm?
Oh, of course you can borrow that scarf.
I'll press it for you.
Um, I have, uh, some news.
Rex died.
I thought they were gonna operate. What happened?
Apparently rex's heart just gave out.
Oh, my god.
So when can we see Bree?
She said she was gonna call.
She's gotta lot of things to do,
planning for the funeral, that sort of thing.
She doesn't look that busy to me.
Hi, hi. What are you doing out here?
Oh, I'm just waiting for, uh, Rex's mother.
She's gonna be here any second.
Honey, we are so sorry.
Oh, do one of you drink soy milk?
I was cleaning out the fridge this morning,
and Rex is the only one who drinks it.
I just bought it on friday. I'd hate to throw it away.
What a waste.
Oh, sweetie.
Honey, you can let it out.
No. No, I can't afford to fall apart right now.
Why?
You're about to find out.
Bree!
Oh, stop here. This is the house.
Is that...
yes, that is Rex's mother.
I can't believe it.
It's like some hideous nightmare.
My life is over!
it appears there's a 7-year gap since your last position.
What, did you take some time off?
I was a stay-at-home mom.
I wish it had been time off.
Boy or girl?
A girl...
and three boys.
Four kids?
Yeah, of course, they won't get in the way of the job
because my husband's staying home with them from now on.
I knew I could never do both jobs justice.
That's why I choose not to have a family.
I didn't want to be one of those kind of women-
you know, sloughing things off onto coworkers
because of a pediatrician appointment or a dance recital.
I get really neurotic about putting people out.
With all due respect, Nina, won't be an issue.
I can leave home at home.
And it's not gonna break your heart
to leave those sad little faces behind?
are you kidding?
This office is paradise-
grown-ups talking about grown-up things.
No screaming, no vomiting, no boogers under the table.
You're gonna have to drag me outta here kicking and screaming-
weekends, holidays, whenever.
All right, Ed wants to make the final decision.
So I will bring you back tomorrow at 3 for a follow-up.
Well,that-that sounds great. Thank you-
Lynette, be early. Show me something.
Okay.
No way. Dad did not have a teddy bear.
He most certainly did.
Oh, that was Doolittle.
Your father never went anywhere without him.
Here's your tea, Phyllis.
Oh.
Look, Bree.
This was the tie that Rex wore
when he graduated from prep school.
I think he should wear it.
You know, for the funeral?
Phyllis, that's an orange tie.
Well, those were his school colors-green and orange.
Well, um, he's being buried in a blue suit.
maybe he could be buried in a different suit.
I don't think so, but thank you, though.
You, uh, you kept dad's old comic books?
Oh, yes, I kept everything.
Look here.
I even kept the dirty magazine
that he hid under his mattress.
He didn't think I knew about it, but I did.
well, looks like dad was into big breasts.
Oh, yes.
That's why I was surprised when he married your mother.
So you're just not gonna talk to me, is that it?
Fine.
I don't need to talk.
Okay. Yes, I had a little affair.
It wasn't the best thing to do, and I'm not proud of it.
But it's not the worst thing that could have happened.
Nobody died.
Oh, don't be such a martyr, Carlos.
Okay, it takes two people.
How many times did you go off on your little business trips
and leave me alone?
See, so technically, you cheated, too.
It's just your mistress was your work.
No, okay. That was a stretch. I'm sorry.
Carlos, wait! Come back. Look, I wanna start over.
We're gonna have a baby.
Isn't that what you always wanted?
Carlos, wait!
I said I was sorry and I love you!
What more do you want?!
I want a paternity test.
Mrs. Applewhite, hi.
I am Bree Van de Kamp,
and this is my daughter Danielle.
Hello.
Hi.
Hey, I'm Matthew.
This is my son.
Hi. I would have been oversooner to introduce myself,
but I'm afraid there's been a death in my family.
My dad.
I'm so sorry.
I lost my dad, too.
I know what you must be going through right now.
Thank you.
Anyway, I'm afraid that my visit has an ulterior motive.
The organist at our churchis on vacation,
and Edie Britt mentioned that you used to be a concert pianist, and-
I would be honored to play for you.
Why don't I bring some sheet music over later
and we can plan some selections?
Thank you. That's just a huge weight off my shoulders.
Oh,these are for you.
How sweet.
Bree, we widows have to stick together.
Bye.
Pretending your father's dead?
Don't you find that a little morbid?
Well, I just thought it could help our cover story, okay?
Just, you know, win 'em over.
Oh, sweetie. I know you meant well.
But in the future, you leave the cleverness to me.
Since when are we protected by dorset security?
Oh, we're not. It's a deterrent in case Zach comes back.
I told mike I didn't sleep last night, so he got me this sign.
That guy is so supportive.
You know he's out right now in a ride-along with the police searching for Zach?
Really?
Yeah.
He's determined to see that kid behind bars.
So tomorrow at school I want you to let everybody know
that we got this new, expensive security system.
Mom, just-
work it into the conversation.
You know, put the word out there
I've gotta tell you something.
Emphasize the motion detectors.
Mom, stop, stop. Listen.
What? What is it?
Yesterday I overheard mike telling that cop
that he didn't wanna press charges against Zach.
He made the whole thing sound like it was your fault.
My fault?
Hi. Uh, I need a paternity test.
Well, we'll just schedule you for an exam.
Oh, no, no. I-I don't need to take a test.
I am just trying to reassure my husband of what I know is true in my heart.
So if you could just slip me someone else's test results,
I could make my own.
I got photoshop for christmas.
Oh, come on.
You look like a fun-loving girl.
I am sure you've been in a couple hairy situations of your own.
Just because I choose to express myself
doesn't mean that I condone adultery.
Sorry.
Paternity test results?
I know. I'm in the same situation.
Really?
Mm-hmm.
I just found out the clinic screwed up
and gave me an egg that belonged to some lesbian.
It was supposed to be implanted in her lover,
and now my husband's freaking out
because he thinks that our baby's gonna be gay!
Okay. We're in slightly different situations.
But do you wanna get a cup of coffee and talk about it?
Yeah. That'd be nice. Thanks.
Yeah. Us girls have to stick together.
We shouldn't let that stupid piece of paper ruin our life.
Yeah!
Obviously, I've known Rex for years,
but when it comes to writing a eulogy,
I like as much input from the family as possible.
Oh. Well, um, what kind of input?
Oh, well, he means anecdotes,
little stories.
Isn't that what you mean, reverend?
Well, yes, but, uh, also-
I thought that you might need some help,
so last night I stayed up all night
and tried to remember funny things
and moments that said so much about Rex as a person.
My. How-how many pages do you have there?
15.
well, you're hardly going to have to write anything at all, reverend.
Some of those anecdotes are just priceless.
Phyllis, these are all things that happened to Rex before he went to college.
So?
Well, don't you think it'd be nice if reverend devoted
part of the eulogy to his life after he was married?
Oh, well, yes, of course.
The reverend will mention that part of his life.
He's going to do more than mention it.
That's the part he'll focus on.
In fact, I think three anecdotes from Rex's childhood is more than enough.
Um, that-that seems fair.
Well, whatever you think is appropriate.
Fine.
I just thought if we were going to focus on a time in Rex's life,
that we might as well focus on the happiest time.
let's talk flowers.
Now I know lilies are traditional,
but I think I can get you a deal on some white roses.
Reverend, if you don't call her on that incredibly insensitive comment,
I'm gonna lose it.
I'm sure she didn't mean it the way it sounded.
I knew exactly what I was saying.
Ladies-
the happiest time in Rex's life was not his childhood.
He loved being a husband,and he loved being a father.
Well, he may have loved being a father,
but your marriage was a disaster.
Phyllis, is there something you'd like to say?
You made the last years of Rex's life miserable,
and now he's dead,
and he'll never have another chance at happiness.
You are no longer invited to the funeral.
What?
You're not serious.
Oh, yes, I am.
I am going to hire security,
and those security men are going to have sticks,
and if you so much asset foot in that sanctuary,
they will be instructed to beat you with those sticks.
Bree, this is your grief talking-
reverend, if you don't back me up on this, so help me,
I will pull the funeral out of your church.
Bree!
I am not kidding.
I will go nondenominational so fast, it will make your head spin.
Susan, I heard what happened with Zach.
How are you doing?
Fine. Is Mike here?
Inside.
Jeez. You must have been terrified.
I mean, he put poor felicia in the hospital.
Did he pistol-whip you?
No.
Oh, come on. You can tell me.
Did he slap you around?
No.
Well, don't get me wrong. I'm thrilled that you're okay.
It's just that when someone holds someone else hostage,
they usually rough 'em up a little.
It wasn't like that.
Not even a little kicking?
Edie...
someone to see you.
Well, hey, how's it goin'?
Good.
So there's a rumor going around
that you don't wanna press charges against Zach.
Is that true?
Yeah.
Wow. Um... I find that... confusing.
Look, if we make a big deal out of this,
he could end up going to prison.
He held a gun to my face, so I'm thinking, "good. "
I've been to prison. He couldn't handle it.
Who cares?
I care.
Well, you should care more about me.
I'm your girlfriend. We're moving in together.
He's just a neighbor. You don't even know Zach.
I know enough about him to know that deep down, he's a good kid.
Mike, he wanted to kill you.
But he didn't.
You never asked me why Zach wanted to shoot you.
Aren't you curious?
Does it matter?
Zach said you kidnapped
his father so you could kill him.
I didn't kill paul young.
I didn't think you did. Now tell me why Zach does.
I found some evidence that suggested that Paul murdered Deirdre.
16 years ago Deirdre had a baby,
and Paul and Mary Alice young kidnapped him
and raised him as their own.
Deirdre tracked him down here to Wisteria Lane
and demanded her baby back.
So Paul killed her?
Actually, it was Mary Alice.
Oh, my god.
Mike?
I answered your phone.
It's the police.
Yeah. Delfino.
You did?
Okay, I can be there in 20 minutes.
Zach's dead.
They want me to come identify the body.
Thanks for coming down.
Since the kid's father is missing,
we didn't know who else to call.
So... you folks ready?
that's not Zach.
You're sure?
He had a gun in my face for six hours.
I know what he looks like.
Can you give us a minute?
Sure.
Zach is your son, isn't he?
Yeah.
I'm pretty sure.
How long have you known?
Paul Young told me.
Deirdre got pregnant before I went to jail
and, um, told me she had an abortion.
Guess she lied.
I see.
When I took Paul out to the desert,
and I was so angry, I just wanted to hurt him...
the way they hurt Deirdre.
But then when he told me
that he and Mary Alice had taken care of Deirdre's baby-
my baby...
that rage just went away.
Kept me from doing something really stupid.
I'm gonna take a cab home, okay?
Mom, grandma's leaving, all right? You have to talk to her.
No, I don't. If you heard the things that she said to me-
look, I'm sure she was a real bitch, okay?
But she's family, so that makes her our bitch.
Let her say good-bye to dad.
She went out of her way to be cruel to me.
I don't want her at the funeral.
Mom, if you don't let grandma come, I will never forgive you.
Did I ask for your help?
You know dad would want her there.
It's true Rex and I did not have the perfect marriage,
but for 18 years I tried my very best,
and for that I am entitled to your respect.
Of course you are.
Of course I respect you.
Well, then why did you say those things to me?
I guess I thought it would be easier to be angry at you
than to be angry with Rex.
I mean, what was he thinking,
leaving me?
I do want you to come to the funeral.
you don't know what that means to me, Bree.
Thank you.
Someone should get my luggage.
Okay, let's get outta here. Tom?
Yeah?
Mom.
What's the matter?
My back-I threw it out. I was holding parker upside down.
Okay. Come on. Give me your feet.
how's that? Is that better?
honey, can you push the interview?
Because I don't think I'm gonna be able
to take care of penny like this.
Don't do this to me.
I don't have time to make a phone call,
and I promised that woman I would not let the kids
interfere with this job.
But that was a stupid promise.
Remember that time when you were away in Tucson, and I had a 104 fever,
but I still managed to take the kids trick-or-treating?
honey...
I don't think that's helping.
Tom, being a mom is like being an E.R. Doctor.
There are no days off, so get up! Get up!
Okay.
Jeez, are you crying?
Just a little.
I'll be fine. You just... go. Just go.
oh, for God sakes.
Give 'em hell, honey.
You...
hi, mrs. Scavo. You can wait inside.
They'll be right in.
Great.
Listen,uh...
Stu.
Stu.
You look like a bright, uh, responsible young man,
and I bet you just love kids. Am I right?
Ed Ferrara, Lynette Scavo.
Thanks so much for having me in.
Nice to meet you. Please,sit.
Thank you.
We're gonna have to make this quick.
I gotta leave in five to catch a plane.
I got celtic tickets on the floor.
This is a great resume?
I see you worked with the Donahues.
You know, I snaked the Oslo candy account from 'em last year.
So you've done a lot of copy work?
I have. But when I moved over to cenn and simmons,
um, I got to do a broader range of campaigns.
T...
uh, V...
and... uh...
radio...
uh, billboards.
could you excuse me for a minute?
Please?
What's going on?
I have no idea.
Stu, you are an idiot.
You're an idiot, an absolute idiot.
Hi.
Ha! Guys, I'd like you to meet Penny.
She gives me all my best ideas.
You brought your baby to the interview.
It won't be an ongoing thing.
You bet it won't.
Nina, it's fine.
Any chance we can get that little lady to be quiet?
Not until I change her diaper.
Could you just give me two minutes?
Sorry. Plane. Well...
then watch me multitask.
Here's how I see it.
You guys run a really good shop,
but if you want your agency to go to the next level,
you have to focus on two things.
First, you've gotta win some awards.
Do some P.S.A.S, pro bono stuff, whatever it takes,
because whether they admit it or not,
clients care about what's in your trophy case.
Two-your web site.
It's the first thing a client's gonna look at,
and it's hard to navigate. There's no site map.
It just wasn't built for people who grow up without computers.
There. And third...
I don't have a third.
Yeah, so that's... it.
Okay.
You're in.
Seriously?
Yeah.
Take the office across the hall. I gotta run.
Well, all right!
Okay, obviously, I'm gonna clean that up.
Here it is in black and white. It's your kid.
What? Why aren't you smiling?
It's not enough.
What do you want, a father's day card?
You knew the one thing that I demanded was fidelity,
and you still went out and screwed around behind my back.
You knew the one thing I didn't want was a child,
and you still tricked me into getting pregnant.
It's not the same thing.
Damn straight. What you did was worse.
We're not very nice people, are we?
No, we're not.
Oh, when we got married,
I thought we were gonna be so happy.
Me too.
Look on the bright side. At least we're still rich.
Thank god for that.
So it occurred to me...
that I was really rude at the morgue.
When you told me about Zach, I was so busy freaking out,
I never actually congratulated you.
Congratulated me?
Yeah, I know how much you've always wanted a child,
and now you have one.
Thanks.
Obviously, um, it was quite a shock,
but it's good news any way you slice it.
What's wrong?
So naturally you'll be wanting to...
have a relationship with him, and that takes time,
a lot of time.
Susan-
and out of all the mixed-up teenagers in the world,
Zach is just the one kid that I can't be around.
I can't have julie around him.
So, um, what I'm trying to say is...
we can't move in together.
But I am so happy for you.
Really, you have a child, and that is good for you.
Isn't there any way-
No. No, I...
so sorry.
I'll-I'll, um,
I'll see you around.
today we've come together to celebrate the life
of Dr. Rex Van de Kamp...
what is he wearing?
What?
I left him an hour ago,
and he was wearing Ralph Lauren.
But it's what Rex would have wanted.
He loved that prep school.
...But which ever coat he was wearing,
Rex always brought an irresistible enthusiasm
and a single-minded determination to...
so as we mourn the passing of Rex Van de Kamp,
we give thanks to god,
for we do not grieve as those who have no hope
but as those who place their trust in god.
wait!
do not close that coffin.
Give me your tie.
What?
Give me your tie.
give it to her! Give it to her.
You look magnificent.
so it looks like Mary Alice killed Zach's birth mother
in order to keep her from taking Zach away.
Oh, my God.
I mean, I knew Mary Alice had killed herself
over something big, but wow.
Can you imagine living with that guilt?
Isn't it bizarre that Paul and Mary Alice
had this secret all those years,
and we didn't even know about it?
No, not really.
I mean, what do we actually know about our neighbors?
I mean, we can tell if they keep their lawns nice
or they take their trash cans in,
but when they do those things,we stop asking questions
'cause if people are good neighbors...
we don't really care what happens behind closed doors.
It had been one year since my suicide...
makes you wonder,doesn't it?
And a lot had changed on Wisteria Lane.
There were new flowers,
new houses
and new neighbors-
the kind anyone would want living right next door.
is that another hymn?
I know. It's silly,
but playing those songs today at the funeral
just got me in the mood.
This is your grandmother's favorite.
Did you remember butter?
I make up this tray every night.
Of course you do. I'm sorry.
Oh, look.
You added a flower.
Thought it'd be nice.
How'd I get so lucky to have a child like you?
You really do try to think about us.
That flower is a small act of kindness
you thought no one would notice,
and yet you did it anyway.
Says a lot about how you were raised.
Well,I guess you did your job.
Thank yourself.
I'll get the tray.
You take the gun.
It really is a lovely gesture.
Previously on "Desperate Housewives"...
Why on earth would you let them
finger paint before breakfast?
It's my job to clean that up now,
so it's my call.
Some households reversed roles.
Let's give this another shot.
Some old flames...
You want me back?
Yeah.
Were put out.
It has to be something
you're ingesting.
Who prepares your meals?
I understand you've been having
some marital problems.
And while some learn
to forgive...
Deirdre got pregnant
before I went to jail.
Zach is your son,
isn't he?
Yep.
Wow.
Others could not
bring themselves
to forget their past.
The remarkable thing
about Danny Farrell
was that he had only been
a paperboy for six months,
and in that time,
he had become the enemy
of every woman
on Wisteria Lane.
If there was a puddle
on someone's property...
he found it.
If a new rosebush
had just been planted...
he destroyed it.
If a cat was enjoying
a moment in the sun...
he ended it.
People wondered
if Danny would ever change.
They should have
talked to Susan Mayer.
She could have told them...
Obnoxious boys
tend to become obnoxious men,
just like the one...
...she had been married to.
Hey!
Karl, I see you.
Just stop right there.
Hey, Susie Q.
What are you doing?
I'm just gettin' the paper.
That's Edie's paper,
and this is Edie's house.
Do we have to do this now?
I haven't had my coffee yet.
Did you spend the night
with Edie?
Oh, my God.
Susie, just calm down.
You are forbidden
from ever seeing her again.
Do you hear me?
Forbidden!
We're divorced. You can't
tell me who I can date.
I live on this street. Your
daughter lives on this street.
I will not have you flaunting
your sexcapades in front of us.
Sexcapades?
Forbidden!
I would love to continue this,
but it's time for breakfast,
and Edie is making me
a frittata.
Oh! Well, I just bet she is.
Mrs. Mayer,
I gotta talk to you.
Oh, now is not
a good time, Danny.
You're a month behind
in your payments.
I'll take care of it,
I promise.
My dad says, if you read
something and don't pay for it
that's the same as stealing.
Hi, Ida. Can we talk
about this later?
I just found out my ex
is dating my neighbor,
and I'm really ticked off.
Save it!
I provide you a service,
and I deserve to be paid
for that service.
Yes, the women
of Wisteria Lane
believe Danny Farrell
to be the enemy.
Deadbeat!
They also believed
the enemy of my enemy
is my friend.
Beautiful lawns...
spacious homes...
happy families...
these are the hallmarks
of suburbia,
but if you look beneath
the veneer of gracious living,
you will see
a battle raging...
A battle for control.
You see the combatants
everywhere...
engaged in their routine skirmishes...
Get outta here!
Fighting fiercely
to have dominion
over the world around them,
all the while knowing...
It's a battle
they will lose.
Oh, hey, honey, um,
just stick that anywhere.
I'll take care of it.
Wow. It's really pilin' up.
Oh, uh, don't worry.
I have a system.
Really?
Yeah, every two days,
I clean.
Two days.
Yeah, I let the mess accumulate
for two days,
and then I clean until
it's sparkling, and then, uh,
the cycle starts all over again.
And why...
...have I never seen
the sparkling part?
Well, because by the time
you get home from work,
the boys have
messed everything up again.
See? That's what I would call
a flaw in the system.
What are you doin'?
I think I'm asking you
to clean the house.
Really? Because it sounds to me
like you're criticizing me.
No.
No, no, no, no. No.
I'm not saying
it has to be sparkling.
How many times did I come home
to a mess
and I never said a word?
Please, don't take this
the wrong way.
I think you are doing a terrific
job, but let's be clear.
When you came home,
it was to clutter.
I mean, come on, this is...
more than that.
Look at him,
just chatting away.
So inconsiderate.
Phyllis, we've only been
waiting here for two minutes.
I told you when we left
the house that I needed to eat.
I have low blood sugar.
Do you wanna
see me keel over?
No... in theory.
Here you are.
Thank you.
By the way,
Mrs. Van de kamp,
I heard about
your husband's passing.
I'm so sorry.
Dr. Van de kamp
was one of my favorite
customers, truly.
That's very sweet of you.
Thank you.
I'm not just being polite,
Mrs. Van de kamp.
How are you feeling?
Well, Mr. Pashmutti...
...we're holding up as best
we can under the circumstances.
I'm sorry. This is,
uh, Rex's mother, Phyllis.
I'm so sorry about your son.
Thank you. You know, the hardest
thing is to lose a child.
I can't even imagine.
Come on, Phyllis. Let's get you
something to eat.
We had no warning. I was doing
dishes when I got the call.
Really?
Phyllis, there are
people waiting, so come on.
Excuse me.
L... I'm so sorry,
but my son just passed away.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
Thank you. I mean,
I was telling
Mr. Pashmutti here,
my life is... is over.
My life is over.
This is ridiculous, you know that?
Pen.
Don't you think I have
better things to do
than to bring you checks
every day,
checks that I could be
signing at home?
This one's dry.
You know, taking away
my access to our account,
that's just vindictive.
Thank you.
Do you know how long it takes me
to schlep out here
to this hellhole?
Exactly. It's the only way
i can guarantee
you'll come and visit me.
That's ridiculous.
You're my husband. I love you.
Obviously,
I would come visit.
I thought it was obvious
that when you love someone,
you wouldn't have an affair.
I was wrong, wasn't I?
I'm getting really tired
of this song, Carlos.
Isn't it about time
you forgave me?
You want my forgiveness,
you got it. My trust...
...that you're gonna
have to earn.
Be careful, Carlos.
Up until now,
I've been really lonely
in that big bed of ours,
but when you're rude to me, it
makes me wanna be not so lonely.
Comments like that
are exactly why
you'll never again
have access to my money.
Why are all rich men jerks?
The same reason
all beautiful women are bitches.
So same time tomorrow?
Sure, baby.
What do you mean, you know?
I mean, I know.
What are you saying, that
your father actually told you
he was gonna be having a one
night stand with Edie Britt?
Uh, mom, this wasn't
a one night stand.
He's been going out with Ms.
Mritt for a few months now. What?
How could you not tell me that?
We share everything.
That's what we're known for.
That's our thing.
Because I knew you'd wig out.
Besides, haven't you always told
me to respect people's privacy?
Oh, I've never applied that concept
to your father's sex life,
and you know it.
Are you done?
No! I have not even begun
ripping into Edie Britt yet.
Oh, that peroxide vulture.
Just know as sure
as I am standing here
that she went after your father
just to tick me off.
Wrong again.
What?
He asked her out.
You lie.
It's true.
He called her for a date
six months ago.
The day after
my birthday party.
The one at the piano bar?
Yeah.
What is it?
Oh, um...
Your father
just came over that day
and told me some stuff.
You know, some stuff
that I haven't...
...and can't tell you.
Wait. Whatever happened to
"We share everything"?
Isn't that our thing,
what we're known for?
Um, actually, I think what we're
known for is sharing clothes.
Yeah. I think
that's our thing.
Why does he keep doin' that?
He knows it's annoying.
He's just trying
to get to us.
Yeah, well, it's working.
Knock it off, down there,
do you hear what I'm saying?!
Matthew. Matthew!
Sit down.
You know
we don't talk to him.
That's part
of his punishment.
How can you just sit here
hour after hour
and listen to that?
Well, that's part of mine.
Carlos, what is this
big emergency?
I had to cancel my hair
appointment with Eduardo today.
Baby, what is it?
I'm completely
freaked out.
Why?
There's this guy,
his name's Richie,
and he's been
saying some stuff to me,
and I'm gettin' worried.
Honey, you and your macho pride.
Just tell him you're flattered,
but you don't swing that way.
He's not hitting on me,
you idiot, he's threatening me.
Really? How?
He said
he's gonna beat me up
unless I come up
with some money.
Well, how much money?
$7,000.
$7,000?!
Keep your voice down.
Why would he think
you have that kind of money?
Because yesterday, in a visiting
room filled with criminals,
my wife referred to me
as a rich man.
Oh, right. Sorry.
That's why I needed you
to bring the checkbook.
He's actually willing
to take a check?
No.
You're gonna take the money
to his girlfriend,
and if she doesn't get it
by tomorrow, I'm screwed.
Honey, I think
this is a mistake.
If we give in to extortion,
the guy's just gonna keep
coming back for more money.
What choice do I have?
You're a strong guy.
You went to college
on an athletic scholarship,
for God sakes.
Yeah, it was for golf.
Oh.
You have all my pants.
Yeah, I know.
Come on in.
I, uh, thought when I took
my stuff back to my house
I got everything.
Oh, it's fine.
They're in the garage.
So how have you been doing?
Good. Um...
I'm, uh, good.
I got a question for you.
Sure, what is it?
Where are we now?
Where are we?
Yeah. We're not
moving in together
and we're not broken up,
so where are we?
I don't know.
Since the guy
who held me hostage
turned out to be your son,
I think logic dictates
that I should move on.
The problem is...
I'm crazy about you.
So...
So I'm thinking we should
keep it casual.
Casual.
What the hell does that mean,
exactly, um, casual?
Uh...
Well, I-i don't...
I don't think there's
anything wrong with us
seeing a movie
once in a while.
A movie. Okay.
Is that it?
Jogging?
There's no law
against jogging.
Anything else?
Shopping. That's casual.
That's fun.
Anything else we can do?
Anything at all?
Mmm, brunch.
Brunch would be nice.
Sounds good to me.
All I can do is take it
one day at a time.
Yes.
Oh, okay. Well...
Thanks so much
for calling.
Who was that?
Oh, someone named
Alan Hanley.
My electrician?
Why were you on the phone
sobbing to my electrician?
Oh, he called to offer you
his condolences.
Then why didn't you
put me on?
Oh, well, we got to talking,
and then he had to go.
He... he had some very beautiful
things to say about Rex.
For God sakes, Phyllis!
Are you saying
that I am too emotional?
I'm saying that even italians
take a break now and again.
My son is dead.
I'm grieving.
So am I, but no one
would ever know it
with your incessant
caterwauling.
Bree!
People want to know
how I'm doing,
but the minute they ask,
you... you jump
into the spotlight,
and they forget all about me.
I need consoling, too, Phyllis.
Have you ever thought of that?
I'm sorry.
It won't happen again.
Thank you.
Of course,
if you didn't constantly
suppress your emotions,
people wouldn't forget
to console you.
Excuse me?
Well, it's true. You're stoic
to the point of being cold.
I am not cold. I just...
Well, I don't like
public displays of emotion.
Well, that's fine,
but people wonder
why they haven't
seen you cry.
I mean, some people
actually wonder
if you truly mourn Rex.
People have said that?
A few, yes.
Excuse me.
I'm looking for Rita Rivera.
Hi, are you Rita?
Yeah, who are you?
I'm, uh, I'm Gabrielle Solis.
Our... our husbands are roommates
at the prison.
Richie and I aren't married.
Oh, I see. Well, uh,
your boyfriend asked my husband
to give this to you.
It's a sort of favor.
It's all there. $7,000.
Son of a bitch!
Oh, don't even
think about it.
Um, hello...
is there a problem?
Let me ask you a question.
Okay.
This might seem
kind of weird,
but what do you think
of my breasts?
Excuse me?
I mean, how do they look to you?
Uh, ey're... they're nice.
Thank you.
I like them, too.
You're right.
That was weird.
You have no idea
what this money is for,
do you?
Uh, no.
No. You... you seem
to have everything you need.
Richie wants me
to get a boob job.
He wants them bigger.
He's obsessed
with huge breasts.
So are you gonna do it?
I told him if he came up
with the cash, I would.
I just never thought the moron
would actually come up with it.
Not that it's any of
my business, but it's your body.
I wouldn't change anything
unless I really wanted to.
But if I don't do it,
he'll leave me.
Honey, he's in jail.
How far is he gonna go?
Maybe it's time you stood up
for yourself.
Tell him you don't need
the surgery.
It's worth a shot.
There you go.
I am so proud of you.
When Lynette went back to work,
she was aware her new job
would be demanding.
What she hadn't anticipated...
was the night shift.
Hey, honey, I thought I heard
you come in about an hour ago.
I did. I had to load
the dishwasher.
You didn't
have to do that.
Ye, I sorta did.
I'm sorry. I've just
fallen behind on my housework.
I just had so many errands
to run today.
But I'll make up for it
tomorrow, okay? I promise.
That's the beauty
of my system...
it's flexible.
You know, for the sake
of our marriage,
please don't mention
the system again.
I said I'm sorry.
What in the world? No, no, don't
touch that. Don't touch that.
Um, Penny had a little,
um, spitty-uppy on the sheets.
And you
didn't change them?
The towel
is very clean.
Oh, that's disgusting.
No, it's just a little spit...
a little milky spit up
on the sheets.
Please, I made a judgment call.
Please respect that.
No, I can't respect that,
and do you know why?
It's stupid.
I'm gonna get
new sheets.
We are not changing
the sheets.
Why are you
yelling at me?
I am not yelling at you, and this is
not about spit up. Of course it is.
No, it isn't.
It's about control.
And as you and I both know, you
have some issues in this area.
Why are you fighting so hard
to sleep on baby vomit?
I am fighting
for a principle.
Being too lazy to change
the sheets is not a principle.
You know what?
You're not gonna win this one.
So you'd better just
crawl back into bed,
and let's go to sleep.
No, Tom!
Tom, no! I'm gonna
change the sheets!
Oh, come on!
No, you come on!
Just get up!
Get up!
That's it!
All right, fine!
Fine! Fine! Fine!
Ah!
Normally Lynette would have
spent a sleepless night
telling herself
she didn't have control issues.
But she couldn't.
She was too busy figuring out
how to bend Tom
to her will.
Ugh! Aah!
Hello?
Hi.
Welcome to the promised land.
Go on.
There.
Good job!
Uh, Betty?
Betty?
Oh, Betty,
can I ask you a question?
Of course.
It's Susan, right?
Yes, hi.
I was just wondering,
are you having some remodeling
done on your house or something?
No. Why?
Well, uh, I work at home,
so I'm home a lot working.
And I just keep hearing
these noises lately.
Uh, it's hard to concentrate.
Well, I haven't
noticed anything.
Really? It sounds like
it's coming from your house.
You know, it's like
a clanging... clanging.
There! There, that was it.
Did you hear it?
Oh, yes.
Matthew's very handy.
He's always doing
projects around the house.
I guess I just don't notice
the noise anymore.
Even at 2:00 in the morning?
Because that's kind of
hard to miss.
I'm so sorry.
Matthew is something
of an insomniac, Susan.
But I will talk to him,
and we'll put a stop to it.
Afternoon, Mrs. Mayer.
Hi, Matthew.
Well, it was nice chatting
with you, Susan.
This is my third phone call,
Mr. Flannery.
And if someone
doesn't call me back soon,
I'm going to be irritated.
Is everything all right?
That darn insurance company
is dragging its heels
on paying Rex's policy,
and I don't understand why.
Well, he died unexpectedly.
And that brings up
a lot of questions.
It's probably easier when people
are just diseased.
Probably.
Hi. Hi.
Oh, hi, Lynette.
I'm sorry.
Am I interrupting?
No, no,
not at all.
I saw you walk in,
and I've been meaning to call
since the service,
but work's been so crazy so...
How are you doing?
Um, I'm all right.
Well, you look amazing.
Do I?
Absolutely.
Well, I can't imagine
what you're going through.
Phyllis?
You're going to have
to stop that.
I can't help it.
When people talk about Rex,
I... I...
I just get emotional.
Well, I'm very sorry
for your loss, too, Phyllis.
He was my firstborn.
I don't know what
I will do without him.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
Is she gonna be okay?
Um, yeah. Sure.
Hold on a second.
There we go.
Feel better?
Lynette,
you were saying?
I forgot.
That's all right. It was
really sweet of you to stop by.
Okay.
So, uh,
are we ready to order,
or do you need
a little more time?
I've been in the insurance
industry for 15 years.
I've never received
a phone call like this.
I'm having second thoughts
about Rex's death.
I've known Rex and Bree
for nearly 20 years.
And I've never had
any reason to suspect
they were anything
but a happy, loving couple,
which is why
this seems so strange.
I found it in Rex's room
after he coded.
"I forgive you"?
George, what are you
doing here?
I'm here to kidnap you.
What?
Get your purse.
I'm gonna take you bowling.
I... I don't know how to bowl.
Or to the movies
or for a frozen yogurt.
Whatever you want.
Um, thank you,
but I just couldn't.
Ah, Bree, I'm sure you haven't
gone anywhere in weeks.
You gotta get out and do things.
It'll help. Trust me.
I do.
I'm just...
I'm just not ready yet.
But it was very sweet of you
to think of me.
Well, you know,
I tried.
And I appreciate that.
It's all right.
Let it out.
You want me to die in here,
don't you?
Carlos, what happened?
What do you mean,
"What happened?"
You talked Rita out of taking the
money. Is that what Richie said?
Yeah, the subject came up
in between kidney punches.
Well, it's not my fault.
She didn't want the money.
Why wouldn't she want $7,000?
Because it's for a boob job.
So?
So her boobs are fine.
And, honestly, what he's doing
to her self-esteem
is just cruel.
I feel sorry for her.
Please, you don't care about her
self-esteem any more than I do.
You just didn't want to give up
all that money.
Well, I do think it's silly
to give someone $7,000
if they don't want it.
Listen to me,
you're gonna go back there,
you're gonna put that money
in Rita's hands,
and you're gonna convince her
that life is not worth living
unless she has jugs
the size of Texas.
Do I make myself clear?
I just realized Rita and I
have a lot in common.
Please don't tell me
you have low self-esteem,
because if I laugh now,
I'm gonna crack the one good rib
that I have left.
We are both controlled
by our husbands,
which is idiotic because
they're both behind bars.
We should have all the power.
I am not trying to control you.
I just don't wanna end up
in the morgue.
This isn't about that.
Gabrielle,
the morphine's wearing off.
I really don't have time
for these games.
Me either, Carlos.
And if you expect me
to go back and sweet talk her
into getting the operation,
I can't show up empty-handed.
Fine, bring me the checkbook.
I'll make out a check
for some cash.
See I was thinking
I'd be writing the checks.
Gabrielle...
Careful, Carlos, you're not
in a position to argue.
Whoo-hoo!
Susan!
Hey, Edie.
So, uh, whee!
Ha ha.
How much do you hate me?
What?
Oh, Karl said that you know all
about our dirty little secret.
Yes, yes, I do.
Well, I feel awful.
I should have told you
that I was doing your ex.
Well, it would've been
the classy thing to do.
Well, etiquette is a lost art
for a lot of people.
You've gotta believe me,
I never, ever thought
anything would happen
with us.
But on our first date,
Karl took me
to a mexican restaurant.
You know what I get like
when I drink tequila.
A couple of shooters
and my bra unhooks itself.
Circumstances beyond
your control. I get it.
So if you'll excuse me.
Hey. Hey, hey.
I am offering you
an opportunity here.
I mean, go ahead...
Vent!
Let me have it.
Come on, tell me
what a bitch I am.
Yeah, for snacking on
your leftovers. I deserve it.
Come on, bring it on.
Honestly, Edie, I don't mind.
You can skate off
into the sunset with Karl.
Be my guest.
Well, that's good to know.
I probably shouldn't
tell you this, but...
While we were in my jacuzzi
last night...
Karl said it was the best sex
he's ever had,
bar none.
Actually, I'm glad
that you shared that,
because here's
a tidbit for you.
Karl said he's still
in love with me.
Edie, what are you doing?
You are a lying liar.
We're in the middle
of the street.
Would you get out of here?
Karl never said that.
Okay, Karl asked me
to get back together
the day after
Julie's birthday.
I said no, which I'm guessing
is the reason
for the now legendary tequila
bra-popping incident.
Please let go.
Oh, no. We're not finished here.
Well, yes, we are.
I'm gonna go.
You don't
have the guts.
In five seconds,
I'm gonna punch it.
Yeah?
I'll key your car!
Not if you're sucking
my exhaust, you won't.
Take back what you said!
No, I won't!
Admit it, you'd do anything
to destroy my happiness!
Edie, for God's sake.
Why would I care if you end up
with a man I despise?
'Cause you and Mike
are finished.
Yeah, word's out.
And now that you
can't be happy,
you don't want
anyone else to be, period.
Edie, come back here!
We're not finished yet!
It was an accident, Karl.
Edie knows it was an accident,
right?
She knows you could've
killed her.
As it is, she's got
a shattered tibia.
Oh, my God.
I'm so sorry.
I sent roses.
Did she get the roses?
Yep, she cut herself
on the thorns.
Oh, my God.
Why'd you tell Edie
about our little conversation?
Well, she was gloating
about sleeping with you,
and I just wanted
to shut her up.
Oh.
So you were jealous?
No!
No! It's just...
We were married.
And... and she's trying to make
this tawdry little affair
you guys have going
on par with that.
It's just...
I got mad.
Susan, you remember the morning
you saw me with Edie's paper?
Well, the night before,
I had asked her if she'd like
to live together.
And she said yes.
Susan?
Just give me a moment.
I'm asking God to kill me.
Oh, look, she... she's fun.
She goes with the flow.
You know, at this time
in my life, I need that.
Are you...
in love with her?
Would you care
if I were?
I want you to be happy.
I even sorta want Edie to be happy.
But what?
I wanna be happy first.
Mike and I were supposed to
move in together, you know?
This was supposed to be
my time.
I heard you and the plumber
were having problems.
Is it over?
I don't know.
It's really complicated.
So you never answered
my question.
Are you
in love with her?
I don't know.
But I can promise you
this much...
I have never loved another woman
the way I loved you.
You walked out on me.
Yeah, but look
how far I got.
I'm just up the street.
Mommy, mommy,
thank God, you're home.
Hey, sweet pea.
Why? What's wrong?
Daddy found a rat.
Oh, did he now?
Honey?
I'm home.
Hey, babe.
Hey.
Hi,
how was your day?
It was good, but,
more importantly, how was yours?
Parker told you
about the rat, huh?
Yep.
Oh, my god,
it was so disgusting.
I came down the steps,
and there it was,
sitting on the counter
eating a leftover
grilled cheese sandwich.
The sandwiches
from yesterday?
Okay, yes, the house
has been too messy.
Obviously, my system
has some kinks in it.
But check it out.
I got my act together.
Wow.
So, um,
I take it you took
the rat outside?
Oh, no,
I smashed it with a shovel.
You killed it?
Not with the first blow.
Whew. Disgusting.
Hey...
little guy.
I just wanted to say
I'm really sorry
about what happened...
with the shovel.
Neither one of us
saw that coming.
I know
it's not much consolation,
but you really helped
my marriage.
That's a lot for a little rat
to accomplish in one lifetime.
Well, it's getting late, so...
That's off to you.
So you'd say the abuse started
a few years into your marriage?
Maybe it started so slowly,
I didn't realize
what was happening.
I mean, he'd slap me
over some little problem.
But he'd always apologize.
Then it got worse.
And one day,
eight years ago, my son
spilled soda on our new carpet.
Before I could move
to protect him,
Virgil had knocked him
on the ground
and began kicking him.
I wanted to protect my baby,
but I didn't get there in time.
What happened to your son?
He died.
I came across one of
his baby pictures last weekend.
That's when the nightmares
started again.
The last doctor I saw said that
I needed to let go of my guilt,
and then I would
start sleeping again.
Of course, that's easier said
than done.
And I am getting so tired.
I'm gonna start you
on nitrazepam.
That should
do the trick.
Thank you.
I certainly hope your husband
was punished for what he did.
Oh, there was retribution.
I made sure of that.
Where were you off to?
I'm, uh, I'm going to see
Rex's lawyer.
We're going to go over some
details involving Rex's will.
Phyllis...
Obviously, I'm just mortified
over slapping you.
I've... I've just been in
a weird place
since Rex's death, but...
That's no excuse.
I'm very, very sorry.
No need to apologize.
You're family.
All's forgiven.
Really?
It's been a difficult time
for all of us.
I totally understand.
Now, go.
You don't want to be late for
your meeting about Rex's will.
Claims.
This is Joe Flannery.
Hello, um,
could I speak to someone
about the death benefits
for Rex van de Kamp, please?
This is his mother.
Yes, uh, we've already spoken
to his wife several times.
We are moving as quickly
as we can.
Are you awaree that my
daughter-in-law has a boyfriend?
I'm listening.
Control...
It's extraordinary the tactics
people employ to obtain it.
Some rely on deception.
While others engage
in outright trickery.
Then there are those
who resort to extortion.
Why do we fight so hard
for control?
Because we know to lose it
is to put our fate
in the hands of others.
And what could be
more dangerous?
Previously on "Desperate Housewives"
As one affair ends...
We don't have to sneak around anymore.
We can have a real relationship.
Another begins...
Edie!
I had asked her
if she'd like to live together,
and she said yes.
And yet another...
This is Rex's mother Phyllis.
Claims. This is Joe Flannery.
Are you aware that my daughter-in-law
has a boyfriend?
Is exposed...
It's not going to break your heart
to leave those sad, little faces behind?
And while some people can't wait
to get out of the house,
others are being kept there,
against their will...
Now which one is Rex's headstone?
I always forget.
It's right down this row.
Oh. Oh, yes.
That's right.
Over the years, Bree van de Kamp
had grown increasingly concerned
over her mother-in-law's forgetfulness.
Oh, honey, did I forget to take
the pins out of that dress?
Her lapses had become more frequent...
Sweetie, didn't I tell you
I was going to paint that chair?
More glaring...
Oh, dear. Didn't I mention
I waxed the floor?
And more dangerous...
Yes, Bree was worried about
Phyllis' faulty memory,
but she was more than happy
to remind her,
especially when it came to
the important things...
So have you given any thought to
when you might be ending your visit?
What?
Have I become a burden?
Is that what you're saying?
I was simply asking
when you were planning to leave.
There was no agenda behind the question.
Oh. I-I don't know.
Why don't we play it by ear?
Yes, let's.
What on Earth?
Oh, my God.
What happened?
It looks like someone dug Rex up.
Well, I got that, but why?
Why would they do that?
I don't know.
Unless...
Unless what?
Maybe this has something to do with
that insurance investigator.
Insurance investigator?
He came by asking
all sorts of questions.
I don't know
what you're talking about, Phyllis.
Maybe you were at the store.
Anyway, he was very suspicious.
Suspicious?
Oh, yes. He has a theory that Rex
didn't die of a heart attack.
He thinks he was poisoned.
It was in that moment
Bree could finally see the truth...
Did I not mention that?
Her mother-in-law's memory was fine.
It was her soul that was faulty.
Desperate Housewives
Season 2 Episode 3
The parties took place on the front lawn
of 4347 Wisteria Lane
every Sunday afternoon.
Chloe Pendergast would bring
the tea set,
which was appropriate,
since she was the hostess.
Brittany Chries provided formal attire
from her mother's closet.
And Marissa Anne McKay invited
the additional guests,
some of whom hadn't been
to a party in years.
Of course, it never occurred
to the three young girls
that while they were busy
playing out their fantasy,
one of the older girls
in the neighborhood
was engaging in a fantasy of her own...
Hey...
Oh, hi, Mrs. Solis.
Ralph.
Off to the mall again?
You know me.
There was nothing Gabrielle enjoyed
as much as shopping.
And even when she couldn't afford
to take anything home,
she took satisfaction in looking
at the merchandise...
Hey, Susan.
What's goin' on?
It's Karl's weekend to have Julie,
and they're always back by 6.
That's our custody agreement,
back by 6, and it's after 6.
It's like 6:15.
Well, see? There you go.
I'm sure they just forgot.
Well, I have a court order.
It's out of my hands.
Yeah, it'd still be nice
if you gave him a grace period.
Oh, I'm being nice.
I could have him arrested.
I mean, don't get me wrong.
I am all for Julie
spending time with Karl.
He is still her dad,
and she loves him.
But...
But he's with Edie.
I mean, she's not exactly
the maternal type.
I wouldn't be a good mother
if I wasn't concerned.
I mean, who knows what passes
for a kid-friendly,
good time in there?
Drugs? Porn? Smoking?
Doesn't sound like they're having
an orgy in there.
Obviously, they saw us coming.
Whoo! That's a strike!
Hey, guys!
Hey! Look who's here!
Parker, guess what I got.
What?
School supplies.
School supplies?!
Yeah, and the best part of it is
I got you a really cool backpack.
Whoa, look at that.
Pretty neat, huh?
Wow. Thanks.
So on your first day of school,
you and your dad can find your cubby
and you can hang it up.
You're not taking me?
Actually, your dad's going to take you
to school on your first day.
Yeah, just me and you, big guy.
I'll be right there to hold your hand.
But I thought mommy was taking me.
Yeah, well, honey, I have to work.
Mommy's boss is a mean, mean lady
and if I miss work,
I'll lose my job and then
we won't have any money to buy food.
Honey, you gotta believe me,
if I could be there,
you know that I would.
All right, I didn't know
it was that important to you.
I will talk to my boss
and I will see what I can do.
Thank you, mommy.
Wow, I don't want to
rain on your parade,
but he just totally manipulated you.
Well, hey, when a kid's that good,
you gotta give him his due.
An autopsy?
Detective, Rex died of a heart attack.
Well, there were some anomalies
in the doctor's report.
Anomalies? What anomalies?
Ma'am, I'm afraid I'm not at liberty
to discuss this any further with you.
Am I a suspect?
I didn't say that.
Well, if I am, you're wasting your time.
I loved Rex and anyone who knows me
will tell you
that I was incapable of hurting him.
You sure about that?
You talked to Phyllis.
Again, I can't discuss the case.
She's my mother-in-law.
Of course she said
horrible things about me.
Ma'am, lower your voice.
She blamed me for every problem
that Rex and I ever had.
So there were problems
with the marriage?
Well, it was a marriage.
Of course there were problems.
May I record this
just so there's no confusion
over your statement?
No, you may not record this.
So you refuse to make a statement?
I'm not refusing anything.
All I'm saying is
stay away from Phyllis.
She's a... She's a raving loon.
Ma'am, perhaps you'd be more comfortable
with an attorney present.
You want a statement?
Fine, I'll give you a statement.
My husband died of a heart attack.
I loved him very deeply,
and your mother did a lousy job.
To Bree's way of thinking,
there were two kinds of people
in the world.
Those who were useless
before their morning coffee...
and those who weren't...
What's going on?
Don't rush me, Bree!
I'm an old woman! Don't rush me.
Get her out of here.
I will tell you one thing.
You wouldn't be acting this way
if you didn't feel guilty
about something!
What's the occasion?
Uh, our anniversary?
Oh, right.
How could you forget our anniversary?
You sit in a cell all day long
starring at a calendar.
What's the big deal?
Our marriage was a shame anyway.
Oh, we're not doing this again.
In real marriages, wives are faithful.
Yeah, and husbands
remember anniversaries,
so I guess we're even.
Are you equating forgetting our anniversary
with cheating on me?
You are clearly determined to ruin
this special day for us.
What is wrong with you
that you don't feel guilty?
I feel tons of guilt, so back off.
You never even apologized.
I apologized a million times.
Yeah, but you always followed it up
with an excuse.
"I was lonely, you weren't home enough,
a woman needs to be loved. "
A woman does need to be loved,
and since you didn't give it to me,
I had to find it elsewhere.
So that's what the teenager was doing
in our bedroom-
filling you with love.
Say what you want,
but John Rowland loved me
like no one ever has.
Not as a trophy or as a possession,
but for me.
He loved me.
No, he really did.
Let me count the ways.
Um, gently, savagely,
frequently, upside down...
Is there a problem here?
No, it's our anniversary.
We're just reliving the good times.
That's an amazing car.
Aston Martin, right?
Uh-huh. Brand-new. Limited edition.
A little anniversary present
from my husband.
He's very generous.
More than he knows.
I'm sorry. What?
I'm singing at church
for the family follies.
Edie's going to accompany me on guitar.
She's really good.
So you and Edie are going to be an act.
Is that a problem?
No. No. I mean, I'm a little surprised
that you didn't ask me to accompany you first.
On what?
You don't play an instrument.
I play the piano. You know that.
How would I know that?
I've never seen you play.
Well, I played in high school.
So the last time you tickled the ivories
was sometime in the late '70s?
It was the early '80s.
Well, I'm not going to argue with you.
You want to do the show with Edie,
and I think that's super.
So she's really good, huh?
She knows her guitar.
Apparently, there are a lot of musicians
in her family,
sort of like the von Trapps.
Except, you know, her brother od'D.
All I'm asking you is to go out
and play a little bit of ball.
Is that such a big deal?
Matthew, you are
such an excellent player, darling,
that people will want
to be your friend.
Then next thing you know,
God knows who will be wanting
to drop by and calling.
Sweetie, we need
to keep a low profile.
Yeah, I know,
but I have got to get out
of this house sometime.
I'm going crazy here, okay?
What is it?
Oh, my daughter is singing
a song at church
and I want to accompany her on the piano
and I haven't played in years.
Oh, you were just so amazing
at Rex's funeral the other day,
I was wondering...
I don't give lessons.
Oh. Oh, okay.
Oh. You have a little, uh, on your...
I'm baking cherry pie. Excuse me.
What happened to maintaining
a low profile?
You keep being rude to everybody,
they're gonna start
whispering about us.
You're right.
We do want to fit in.
Lynette, check it out.
Jason's mouth.
Stu, isn't that
the new video conference setup?
Yeah. Isn't the resolution fantastic?
Hey, Nina. Mm-hmm?
Uh, about tomorrow morning...
Mm-hmm?
You know how the first hour of
the morning meeting is always so slow?
'Cause I've got this thing...
Good God, this is not
about your kids again, is it?
I know, I promised
I wouldn't do this,
but Parker really needs me to be there
on his first day of kindergarten.
He's so freaked out I can't be there.
I'm sorry. How is this my problem?
Because we can't escape
the fact that I have kids.
I love my job, but to be fair,
there's gotta be some balance.
Okay, how about the people
that don't have the kids?
Did you ever consider that they might need
a little more balance in their lives, hmm?
Like, maybe they want
to go see a matinee
or perhaps they want
to come in a little late
after a big crazy night out
or maybe they just want
to get a hair cut,
which I, myself, have not been able
to do for two months.
So, no, this is about fairness to the people
who are childless by choice, okay?
Okay. Good point.
And I'm sorry about your hair.
I can see why you're upset.
Open wide.
Not now, Stu.
Hang on a sec.
I don't understand.
This system is gonna let mommy
be with you on your first day of school.
The resolution is fantastic.
The next day,
Gabrielle decided to cheer herself up
with another round of window shopping.
But this time, she was taken aback
by what was on display...
Mrs. Tilman. Mr. Delfino.
I, uh, heard you were back
from the hospital,
so I brought you these.
Oh, I can't tell you
how long it's been
since I got flowers
from a handsome man.
I mean, I could,
but I don't want your pity.
Where are you off to?
I'm going back to Utah
for a few weeks.
The recuperation's taking longer
than the doctors anticipated.
Speaking of my attack,
have they caught young Zachary yet?
No, actually, that's why I'm here.
So the flowers were just a ruse.
Figures. I'm trying to find Zach
before he gets in any more trouble.
Do you know any friends
that he might have,
anywhere he might be holed up?
I know you were close to him.
Funny thing, since he beat me
and threw me down the stairs,
we just don't stay in touch
like we should.
Since when do you care so much
about Zach Young?
It's complicated.
I'll bet.
I'm sure he's out there somewhere
trying to find his father,
which I trust you made impossible.
No, I let Paul go.
I couldn't go through with it.
That was a mistake.
He will spend the rest of his life
running from the police.
I think that's punishment enough.
Zach is the only connection
that Paul has with his dead wife.
At some point, he will run back here
looking for him.
I don't like to be negative,
but you really should have killed him.
At the risk of ruining
a lovely evening,
I have some unpleasant news.
The police dug up your father today.
What? Why?
Well, apparently, they want
to do an autopsy.
They don't think
that he had a heart attack.
They think that somebody
was poisoning him.
Who would have poisoned daddy?
Well, apparently, I'm a suspect.
Well, they always
look at spouses first.
It has something to do
with statistics.
It's just a formality.
I'll be cleared in no time.
Would you two please stop
looking at me like that?
Obviously, I did not kill your father.
I loved him deeply.
Yeah, but you and dad
had a lot of problems.
Everyone knows that.
Yes, we had issues,
but I would never have hurt him.
What about the night daddy had
his second heart attack?
You must have loved him a lot to make the bed
before taking him to the hospital.
I was in shock, Danielle.
You know that.
Andrew, surely you don't think
I murdered your father.
I know you didn't.
You're not capable of murder.
Thank you.
That wasn't a compliment.
It takes guts to kill somebody.
Thank you so much for changing
your mind about helping me.
I really appreciate it.
I'm happy to help...
and I'm sorry
if I seemed rude before.
I I was having a bad day.
That's good.
That's really good.
You might want to lay off the pedal.
Really?
Oh, I thought it made it
sound more professional.
It doesn't.
Boy, your son really likes
to play his hip-hop music loud.
The good news is
it drowns out the sound of the dryer.
Arch your fingers, Susan.
Hi. I'm sorry to interrupt.
I knocked, but I guess
you guys didn't hear me.
No, we heard you.
We were just hoping
that whoever it was would go away.
I'm still hoping that'll happen.
What's up, mom?
Well, I have good news.
Um, I've been taking piano lessons
with Betty Applewhite,
and, uh, well, I just thought
maybe I could join you guys.
You know, like a trio.
Doesn't that sound fun?
I don't do trios,
but thanks anyway.
Well, I don't mean
to be technical here,
but this show,
I mean, it really is supposed
to be a family thing,
and I hate to point out
you're not family.
No, but I have talent,
and to most audiences,
talent trumps family.
Well, what makes you so sure
I don't have talent?
Hmm, just a hunch.
Yeah, well, we've all
seen your talent,
which is a nice way of telling you
why don't you put some curtains
on your bedroom window?
Guys... oh, come on, be honest.
You didn't want any part of this
until you found out
that I was involved.
That is so not true!
Oh, yes, it is.
It burns you that
your own daughter picked me over you.
She did not pick you.
It just didn't occur to her that
I would agree to do it.
Well, now she knows,
and if she had it
to do over again, she'd pick me.
No, she wouldn't.
Well, why don'twe put it to a test?
Julie, who would you
rather have play with you?
Oh, no, no, no, no.
No, it's okay, honey.
Who do you want to be with you
in the family talent show?
Yes, who do you want with you
in front of all of those people?
And remember, it's a church.
They are going to be judging you.
Ohh... okay.
Well, first of all, you both suck,
but if I had to choose...
I guess I'd pick my mom.
Sorry, Edie.
Fair enough.
I'd like my pitch pipe back, please.
It was you, wasn't it?
Hello, John.
Long time, no see.
One of the neighbors saw
an Aston Martin driving away,
and what do you know?
Well, someone had to tend to the yard.
You were busy elsewhere.
You saw us?
Yes, and I have to say
she's old enough to be your mother.
Hell, she's old enough
to be my mother.
Joan's only 41.
Joan?!
You're calling her Joan?!
Why shouldn't I?
She's my friend.
I know your friends,
and I have a hunch
you don't do to your friends
what I saw you doing
to that wrinkly old lady.
Okay, so you caught me
doing it with somebody else.
What's the big deal?
You're supposed
to be in love with me.
What?
How many times
did you say it?
How many times
did you whisper in my ear,
"You're the only woman
I'll ever love"?
I don't know. A bunch.
So were you lying to me?
Were you just trying
to get me into bed?
No, of course not.
I loved you, but we broke up.
Yeah, like five minutes ago!
Haven't you ever heard
of a mourning period?
I know it seems quick,
but I have feelings for her.
In fact, I think
I may be in love with her.
Oh, my God.
What's the matter?
Is it the baby?
No.
Oh, no, no.
It's me.
I am beyond stupid.
You're not stupid.
Oh, no, I am.
Yesterday, I was still fantasizing
that it could work with you,
that a one-bedroom
apartment might be cozy.
Mrs. Solis, please.
Oh, my God. I almost left my husband
for someone who calls me Mrs. Solis.
So are you upset because
you want to get back together?
Because I can break up with Joan.
That's okay, sweetie.
I'm good.
So this is it for us?
'Cause I really feel like
we should end it better than this.
Actually, John,
given how stupid both of us have been,
this is an entirely
appropriate ending.
Mrs. Van de Kamp.
What can I do for you?
I would like to submit myself
to a lie detector test
to eliminate any uncertainty
about what happened with my husband.
Are you sure
you don't want a lawyer present?
I'll waive all that.
My only stipulation is
that I want my children
to be able to see me
answer the questions.
I think we can accommodate you.
Is your name Bree van de Kamp?
Yes.
Were you married to Rex van de Kamp?
Yes.
Did you and your husband
temporarily separate last year?
Yes.
Did you kill your husband?
No.
Do you know a man
named George Williams?
Yes.
During your separation
from your husband,
did you have a relationship
with Mr. Williams?
What does that
have to do with anything?
Just YES or NO responses, please.
Well, I'm not gonna respond to something
that's none of your business.
Mrs. Van de Kamp,
if you want us
to take this polygraph seriously,
answer the questions we ask, okay?
Who's George Williams?
He's our pharmacist.
During your separation,
did you have a relationship
with Mr. Williams?
Yes.
Are you in love with Mr. Williams?
What?
Are you in love with Mr. Williams?
No.
Um, I-I was thinking
of something else just then,
so why don't you ask me
the question again?
Are you in love with Mr. Williams?
No.
Did you see that?
Yeah, I saw it.
Hello, Susan.
Are you ready for your lesson?
Yep, I am.
I think I'm going to make
another push for using that pedal.
I think it adds grandeur.
I want to talk to you!
I'm busy now.
I cannot believe
you kicked Edie out
of Julie's performance!
I did not kick Edie out.
Julie made that call.
Because you played the mom card.
Well, it is a family recital,
and Edie is not family.
One day, she could be.
Ohh, don't even joke like that.
H how about your
plumber/convicted murderer,huh?
He seems to keep popping up
at "family" events.
It was not murder,
it was manslaughter,
and that's totally different.
Mike and I aren't even
living together,
and he cares about Julie.
Well, so does Edie, huh?
She was really looking forward to
performing with Julie.
If you think Edie Britt cares
about anybody other than herself,
you are living in a fool's paradise.
You don't know her the way I do,
and the only reason
she's interested in Julie
is to mess with my head.
Hey, that's both
crazy and self-absorbed.
That's a twofer! Way to go!
Whether you choose
to believe it or not,
they're both great together,
and if you don't believe me,
ask Julie.
I'm sorry you had to witness that.
Oh, that's okay, hon.
I have lived my share
of family knock-down drag-outs.
Well, I hope it wasn't as ugly
as me and Karl.
You'd be surprised.
Parker, honey, can you hear me?
Tom, why isn't he talking?
Um, honey, there are
a lot of kids here.
He's a little stressed.
Parker, say hi, say hi. Mommy?
Oh, hey, honey,
this is so exciting.
Your first day of school.
You're going to make
so many friends.
Lynette, staff meeting, now.
Uh, right, yeah.
I'm going to be right there.
Now. Now, now, now!
Stu, this coffee, it's cold.
Honey,
I'm going to be right back.
Mommy? Where are you going?
Right back.
Mommy, come back!
Okay, let's turn to page five.
Damn. I forgot my prospectus.
Any extra copies?
No? Oh, I'll be right back.
Hi, I'm back.
How's he doing?
Um, um, honey, he's upset
because he wanted to show you
his cubby. You left.
Oh, honey,
I'm here. I'm here.
You can show me your cubby now.
Nina found extra copies.
She wants you back now.
Okay. I'll be back
in two seconds for you.
Mommy! Mommy! Don't go!
So the big issue here
is second-quarter billing.
Where are you going?
Ladies' room.
No. Nina, nature is calling.
Lynette, hold it for ten minutes.
We have to get through this.
What I'd like to do is trade out
the invoicing structure.
Let's take a look at our graphs
on page ten, please.
Lynette had been struggling
to balance her career
and her family.
She finally saw an opportunity
to tip the scales in her favor...
Instead of badgering
clients with invoices
on the shorter term campaigns,
I say we bill on delivery.
Yes!
Bill on delivery, yes!
Are you having a seizure?
No, no, I'm just...
I'm very excited.
It's a really good plan.
Yeah, mmm.
Now, what happened
on the burman account
is that they were sent
duplicate bills
by Tina and Ronin Accounting
and I'm not pointing any fingers,
but Tina, Ron,
about walking in
and seeing all my lines lit up
with disgruntled-aah!
Ohh! Hot! Hot!
Help.
Stu! Aah! Aah!
And that's why
we packed you extra cookies
so you could share
with all your new friends, remember?
Uh-huh.
I think we're good to go now, honey.
You're going to be great, Parker.
I love you.
I love you, too, mommy.
Bree, hi.
What can I do for you?
Well, for starters,
you can help me prove to the police
that we didn't conspire
to kill my husband.
Okay.
So because of the anomalies
in Rex's blood,
the police started to wonder
if I'd been poisoning Rex.
That's absurd.
Lots of things can cause
high potassium levels-
renal failure, low sodium.
Well, that's why I took the polygraph,
to prove to them that I was innocent.
Obviously, you passed.
Sort of.
Well, I think the police
now have a different theory,
which is if I wasn't
poisoning Rex on my own,
then maybe you were helping me.
You're kidding.
No, that's why I need you
to take the polygraph, too.
W what?
It's the quickest way
to prove to the police
that they're wrong.
I I don't understand.
We're just friends.
Why would the police assume
that people in a platonic relationship
would want to murder someone?
Um...
Um, during the test,
they asked me some questions
about you and, um, us
and whether we had a relationship
and I said yes, because it's true.
And then they asked me
something else,
something I hadn't considered.
Which was?
They asked meif I loved you.
What did you say?
I said no.
Oh.
But according to the polygraph,
that wasn't exactly true.
Well, I don't...
I don't know if that means anything.
Polygraphs aren't completely reliable.
I think perhaps the machine
picked up on something,
something that I wasn't aware of.
Wow.
What's why I need you to take the test
and answer the detective's questions,
because I'm not going
to know exactly how I feel
until we put this behind us,
but then, once we do...
we can move on.
Can those Chicorelli sisters
dance or what?
Wow, look out, Broadway!
Now don't forget
that we will have cookies and juice
set up in the basement
after we're done here.
We want to see you all there.
And for our next act,
please welcome the musical stylings
of Julie and Susan Mayer.
I'll be right back.
Oh, um, I'm just gonna need
a couple of seconds,
so feel free to pray.
Edie, the other day when I saw you
making music with my family,
I got a little jealous
and I went a little crazy
and I pushed you out.
Seeing you sitting here today,
well, I can see how much
you care about julie,
and she comes first,
and it should be you up there
playing with her, not me.
So I'm sorry.
Thank you, Susan.
How convenient that you decided this
after I showed up without my guitar.
Well, like I said, I'm sorry.
I wish it could be you up there.
You know, I play piano.
And so let's all welcome Julie mayer
and her aunt Edie.
Whoo-hoo!
You did a good thing.
Yeah, well, I try.
This little light of mine
I'm gonna let it shine
this little light of mine
I'm gonna let it shine ohh,
give me a break.
This thing has, like,
90 flats in it.
Poor Julie.
Stop it. You're loving this.
No, not at all.
Let it shine, shine, shine
let it shine.
So they said you needed to see me.
What is it?
What's goin' on?
Um, I've been thinking...
You know, about, um...
Everything that happened with John...
And...
And, um...
I was really selfish and stupid.
And I'm sorry.
I really am sorry.
That's all I had to say, really.
You know what?
That is the best anniversary gift
that you've ever given me.
Really?
Yeah.
Actually, the one you gave me
is really nice,too.
Everyone enjoys a game
of make-believe now and then.
Of course, the ways
in which we play can vary greatly.
Sometimes we tell ourselves
work won't interfere
with our family life...
Lynette, staff meeting, now.
Yeah.
Sometimes, we imagine
certain relationships
to be more meaningful
than they really are.
Occasionally, we put on a show,
as if to convince
ourselves our secrets
aren't really all that terrible.
Yes, the game of make-believe
is a simple one...
Did you know Rex van de Kamp?
Yes.
Did Mrs. Van de Kamp
ask you to poison her husband?
No.
Did you poison Rex van de Kamp?
You start by lying to yourself...
No.
And if you can get others
to believe those lies...
You win.
Previously on "Desperate Housewives"...
you're not taking me?
Dad's gonna take you.
Lynette's new job came with a price.
If this charge sticks,
I get sent away for eight years.
And carlos paid for his mistakes.
Are you in love with mr. Williams?
No.
I think the machine picked up on something
that I wasn't aware of.
While bree detected feelings
she'd never known.
You come within 10 feet of her,
I will have you arrested. Now get out.
Susan discovered something...
Zach is your son, isn't he?
Too close to home.
The residents of the fairview county jail
looked forward to every tuesday.
That was the day that Gabrielle Solis
came to visit her husband.
The inmates went out of their
way to give her compliments
whether she wanted them to or not.
With each visit,these accolades became
increasingly inventive.
Still, Gabrielle was not flattered.
In fact, Gabrielle started to
dread this special attention.
Until one day, when...
I don't think a conjugal visitis
such a ridiculous request.
With all due respect, mrs. Solis,
let's just get throughthe discovery phase first, okay?
But I don't think I can wait that long.
I am trying to get your husband out of jail.
Do you want me to just stop everything
so you can have a booty call?
Excuse me,we are husband and wife.
We make love. It is a very sacred covenant.
Okay, look, all we need is 20 minutes.
I said no.
You can't tell me no.
You work for me.
You will make it happen.
You can't force me to do anything.
I am not your maidor your gardener.
Whoa! Oh!
I can have you arrested for that.
Oh, really? And how about for this?
Ow!
You crazy bitch!
Ow!
Hey, apologize to the lady.
Big mistake, pal. I play golf with the warden.
You're gonna rot-
You heard him. Apologize.
Look, fellas,
I am just trying to do my job.
This is all her fault!
If she weren't so damn horny-ow!
All right! All right!
come on!
It was at that moment it occurred to Gabrielle...
apologize!
This was the nicest compliment she had ever received.

2x04 My Heart Belongs To Daddy
Transcript: cfsmp3
Synchro: Narkond
This is Dedicated to CFT
There was one thing all the fathers
on Wisteria Lane had in common-
they could return home from a hard day's work
to the family they'd left behind
and not feel at all guilty about the precious
moments they had missed.
Sadly,the same could not be
said for the working mothers.
Hey, honey, I held dinner
for as long as I could.
It just got...
too late for them.
You couldn't have given
'em coffee or something?
I just feel like I'm missing out
on their lives entirely.
Hey, you sit, eat, and I will fill you in.
Oh, don't eat that. That's been sitting out for hours.
That's for mrs. Mulberry.
This...
is for you.
I'm sorry. Who?
Oh, mrs. Mulberry.
Parker has an imaginary friend.
Um, british nanny.
I think he really locked into the
whole "Mary Poppins" thing.
Is that why he's sleeping with an umbrella?
He carries it with him everywhere.
It's a security blanket.
When did this start?
About a week ago, I guess.
And you don't find it odd
that Parker's new nanny
made her appearance right at
the time I went back to work?
Kids have imaginary friends.
It's no big deal.
I'll agree with you to a point,
when they're flying kangaroos or giant robots,
not surrogate mommies.
Hey...
Parker is having a little trouble adjusting.
That's all.
Apparently, so are you.
Honey, don't be so sensitive.
I hope you're right.
At the risk of sounding too sensitive,
how come she gets a bigger portion?
That's it?
You're the one who said you wanted
things to be casual between us.
Yeah,
but that doesn't mean we have
to act like brother and sister.
I mean, you bought me ribs.
I have gratitude to express.
What's wrong?
I can't do this.
This casual thing-
it's-it's weird.
No! No! It's not.
We're just gonna pretend like it was
when we first started dating.
We just see each other occasionally,
you know, until we get
the zach thing resolved.
Yeah, well, we'll just be easy
about it. No commitments.
Except, of course,
neither of us is allowed to date anybody else.
Look, I...
I know how you feel about Zach.
And, look,
I don't blame you.
But he's part of the package right now,
and either you can accept that or you can't.
Well, anyway...
Mike, wait!
I accept.
Are you sure?
Zach's your son.
And I have Julie,
and you've totally accepted her.
I mean, granted, she's been
the model child so far.
But she's almost 15. She's going to
turn on me any minute.
And you better be there
to help me when it gets ugly.
I will.
Good night.
Uh, Susan?
Yeah?
Technically, we don't have to be casual anymore.
I can be naked in 20 seconds.
That includes travel time.
Carlos, will you calm down?
You incited a prison riot.
It wasn't a riot.
It was more of a melee.
Who's going to defend me now?
Doyle knew my case.
He knew the judge.
He called me a bitch.
Well, were you acting like one?
He refused to help me get a conjugal visit.
Hold it.
My lawyer's in traction
because you wanted sex?
Not just for me, for us.
In case you haven't noticed, Carlos,
our marriage is still on shaky ground.
And you thought a conjugal
visit would fix it?
It couldn't hurt.
Ever since you've been in here,
all we do is bicker.
That's all we ever did when I was out.
That's what we do!
Yeah, but when we would finish arguing,
we would have this great sex.
Now all we do is fight,
and there's no payoff, and it sucks!
You and I need to get laid!
Oh, don't judge me.
You're not in here because
you got caught helping the poor.
See, we'd be enjoying this argument more
if we had something to look forward to.
Fine. Get the damn lawyer.
And make it quick.
I take it that was my good night kiss.
George, you're a very special friend.
You are, but Rex hasn't been dead four weeks,
so I think kissing on the lips is-
further than you want to go.
Exactly. I hope you don't mind.
Andrew, what are you doing?
Taking out the garbage.
Of course. You remember mr. Williams.
Hi, Andrew.
George.
Uh, well, it's getting late, so...
yeah. So let me know if you want
to go out to dinner again soon.
There's a couple new restaurants I'd like to try.
You know, we've been eating out a lot lately.
Why don't you come over friday
for a home-cooked meal?
Wouldn't that be nice?
Oh, I would love that.
So you leaving or what?
We're not done talking.
She said it was getting late.
In case you missed that, that was a hint.
Andrew...
that wasn't a hint.
I'll go when I'm ready.
Actually, it is getting late, and I am tired so...
see? You heard the lady. Now...
take off.
Andrew.
It's okay. He's not really that tough.
He knows I would never hit a child.
Andrew!
George!
Stop it, the two of you, this instant!
This was a perfectly lovely evening,
and now the both of you have ruined it.
I will not tolerate this kind of behavior.
Do you understand?
All right, then.
George, we'll see you friday for dinner.
I'll be serving fish.
Hey, buddy.
Hey, wake up, sleepyhead. Parker.
Hi. Hi ya, pal.
Hey, what do you say
you and me go get some donuts, okay,
before mommy has to go to work?
Yeah? Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on.
All right. Oh.
So what do you think you're gonna have,huh? Jelly?
'Cause I think I'm gonna have a bear claw.
Stop!
I forgot mrs. Mulberry.
What?
Oh, um, well, since I'm here,
maybe she could just relax
in the house for a while,okay?
No, I need her!
Okay.
Hello, mrs. Mulberry.
Don't forget to buckle up.
Here we go.
Wait!
You forgot her umbrella.
Well, Parker, we don't have time.
No!
she needs it.
Hi.
Hey, what are you still doing here?
I'm lookingfor Parker's umbrella.
Have you seen it? No. Nope. Sorry.
Hey, honey, you better hurry.
You're gonna be late for work.
Thank you for that.
I couldn't find mrs. Mulberry's umbrella,
so I brought her sun hat instead,
all right?
And here we go. It's in the shower.
What?
Mrs. Mulberry says she left it in the shower.
Well, why didn't mrs. Mulberry
volunteer that information
before I turned your room upside down
looking for it, hmm?
Are you going to go get it?
No, I'm not gonna get the damn umbrella!
I'm so sorry, sweetie. I am not mad at you.
What are you doing?
Uh...
we don't want donuts.
Ahem.
Andrew, you are not leaving
the house dressed like that.
I'm just going to meet some of the guys at the swim club.
I don't care. Put this on.
Every time you leave this house,
you represent this family,
and the least you can do is not humiliate us.
A ripped t-shirtis just a look.
Yes, a bad one.
I hope you haven't made plans for tomorrow night.
Look, if you think I'm having dinner
with the pharmacist, you're crazy.
Part of the reason I'm having him over
is so that you can get to know him.
Yeah, well, I don't want to get to know him.
Honey,the feelings that you're having
are perfectly normal.
But George isn't trying to take your father's place.
He's-well, he's just a friend.
Really? Just a friend?
So you're not planning on getting more serious
with this guy in the future?
You know, I haven't even thought about it.
You're so transparent, it's pathetic.
You're worried about a ripped t-shirt
humiliating this family?
Wait till people see that you're dating the town nerd
less than a month after your husband's funeral.
I'll be serving dinner tomorrow night at 7.
Please don't be late.
I'm sorry, but I already have plans.
Andrew, don't you have a meet at the swim club?
Yeah, so?
Doesn't it require a large entrance fee,
one that you can't afford by yourself?
Are you blackmailing me into coming to dinner?
Oh, you don't know the lengths
I'd go to for even seating.
Mayer, is this yours?
Blew into my front yard.
Oh,sorry. I'm helping Mike find Zach.
You know, so we can all rest easy at night.
Uh-huh. And put him in jail?
I don't think Mike
would do thatto his own son.
You know?
That Mike's Zach'sreal father? Yes.
Oh. Julie told Karl, Karl told me,
and I, well, sent out a few e-mails.
Well,thanks for your discretion.
Boy, you would do anything to get
Mike Delfino to love you.
So what's gonna happen to
little creepy when he gets here?
Are you gonna betucking him in at night?
Making him breakfast in the morning?
Careful to bob and weave as he
tries to blow your head off?
You know, Edie, could you just back off?
I mean, the truth is, we're probably
never gonna find Zach anyway.
It's a needle in a haystack.
Oh, I see.
And then you'll still come off as little
miss perfect, self-sacrificing girlfriend,
putting his needs
ahead of yours.
Oh, why you conniving little shrew.
I don't know why we're not closer.
There was a reason David Bradley
was the most successful lawyer in all of fairview.
His arguments were persuasive...
no one ever has to know.
His manner was forceful...
take it off. Take it off.
And he tended to win on appeal.
Please.
And when it came to the more challenging cases,
he knew it was to his advantage
to raise the first objection.
I'm not gonna take your case.
What?
yes.
sorry to interrupt, mr. Bradley.
Your dinner just canceled. Want me to pull the reservation?
No, I still have to eat.
I'm sorry, where were we?
You were about to turn me down,
and then you reconsidered
once you realized I was gonna
throw a ton of money at you,
which I am.
Ah. It's not about the money for me anymore, mrs. Solis.
The fact is, if I don't feel passionately about a client,
if I don't feel that fire in my belly,
I don't bring my a-game to court,
and from what I've read, it'll take
my a-game to save your husband.
Is this about the gay bashing thing?
He's innocent.
He went berserk and attacked a man in court.
Yeah, but that was a jealousy thing.
The man that my husband was trying to kill in court
is not the least bit gay, trust me.
Your file also says you're seeking conjugal visits.
Trying to keep the old marriage alive, huh?
Why does everybody have a problem
with me having sex with my husband?
Can I be frank?
Only if it ends with me getting what I want.
Your marriage is doomed.
Excuse me?
I've been doing this for a long time, mrs. Solis.
I know what incarceration
can do to a relationship.
Marriage is hard enough,
but when you throw incement walls,
armed guards, iron bars,
it tends to go down hill rather quickly.
Conjugal visits not with standing.
But I-
listen, you want my advice?
Walk away.
You're young.
You made a mistake. You learn from it.
Maybe next time you'll marry smarter.
Now if you'll excuse me, I have dinner reservations.
Reservation.
You're eating alone, remember?
And I have a feeling it's not the first time.
I'm so sorry I couldn't get here sooner.
I forgot my husband had to take our youngest
to the pediatrician and...
it's all right, mrs. Scavo.
So... what did Parker do?
Are you aware that your son has an imaginary friend,
a mrs. Mulberry?
Yes. We've met.
Well, um, yesterday,
Parker demanded that
mrs. Mulberry get her own easel during art, which was fine.
But today it was a desk.
And unfortunately, we didn't have an extra desk.
Oh.
That must have been ugly.
It was.
Patty was rammed
with this.
Oh. I am so sorry.
Mrs. Scavo,
have you experienced a death in your family recently?
No. No. Why?
Imaginary friends are often created
as a coping mechanism
to-to deal with loss.
Uh-huh.
Or it might occur as the result of some major change
or extensive alteration in their lives.
Exactly.
A manifestation of some deep-seated unhappiness.
Can you think of anything
that might shed a little bit of light
on this for us?
Mrs. Scavo?
thank you.
And I'm thinking, it's the golden gate bridge.
What a great place to get
a picture of the sunset.
So I lean out way over the rail to get the shot.
Next thing I know, the police arrive.
People had called 9-1-1 from their cell phones.
Thought I was suicidal.
I can't believe how well those two are getting along.
Yeah, it's freaky.
Andrew is being polite and engaging.
He's even laughing at george's jokes.
That's why it's freaky.
George's jokes aren't funny.
so, George, can I ask you a question?
And it's kind of personal.
Sure.
Have you ever actually been with a woman?
Excuse me?
Well, let's be honest. I think it's obvious
by the way that you talk and act
that you're not a player,
so I was just curious to find out
if you had ever actually gotten in the game.
My experience with women is none of your business.
Oh, I think it is.
I mean, you're dating my mom.
And we both know that at your age,
dating's a little more than just holding hands.
We're not dating exactly.
Oh, sure you are.
And you know what? I think it's great.
But I wanna make sure my mom's happy,
you know, and it would really set my mind at ease
to know that she's with a guy that knows how to please a lady.
This is inappropriate.
You know, my parents had a great sex life.
Man, I heard 'em through
the wall of my bedroom once.
Please shut up.
You should've heard my mom, too.
She had this-this weird moan.
It was kind of like, um... mmm.
Isn't that bizarre?
That's the sound my mom makes
when she climaxes.
Okay. Time for cobbler.
Sorry, one of the dessert plates doesn't match.
I tried to replace it, but it's spode florence.
It's a rare pattern.
It belonged to my grandmother.
But hopefully once you taste the dessert,
you'll forget all about it.
I'm not hungry.
George, you have to have this.
It's absolutely scrumptious.
Mmm.
Mmm!
Thats it.
go to your room!
George!
You heard me. Go to your room.
Mr. Williams, what's wrong?
Did I say something wrong?
Bree, please back me up.
Well, what did he say?
I can't say. It's too sordid. But he said it!
Are you gonna back me up or what?
George, I can't allow you to discipline my child
if you won't even tell me what he did.
George.
George!
mrs. Solis, David Bradley.
Look, I feel really bad about the tone of our meeting,
so to make up for it, I'm gonna do you a favor.
The more I think of it,
the more I'm convinced your marriage is a train wreck-
the gnarly type,you know,mass casualties.
Anyway, I'm passing on the name
of a great divorce lawyer, kir-
you have some nerve,
leaving that message on my machine.
You realize this is entirely inappropriate?
I will tell you what is inappropriate.
You making sweeping assumptions about the state of my marriage.
Care for a drink?
No!
I like to keep a clear head
when I'm telling people off.
What makes you think you know
anything about me or my husband?
Well, your husband's record speaks for itself.
With you, I had to rely on my instincts.
Would those be the same instincts
that picked out that cologne?
You're privileged. You're pampered.
You're spoiled.
You want what you want when you want it.
You want excitement.
A quickie every five months in a prison trailer
isn't gonna scratch that itch.
With all due respect, I will decide for myself
what needs to be scratched and when.
Mrs. Solis, you are a beautiful,
desirable woman.
Now your husband is a dimwit,
corrupt, violent criminal.
You could do... so much better.
Are you hitting on me?
What would you say if I were?
I'd say I'm pregnant.
So I see, you're stuck.
I'm not stuck, mr. Bradley.
Believe it or not, I love my husband.
I charge $700 an hour,
plus xeroxing.
I'll pay you 6,
and I expect a conjugal visit tomorrow by noon.
Aren't you demanding?
Like you said...
I want what I want when I want it.
So a woman I talked to at social services
said a lot of runaways hang out here.
What?
Just happy to be spending the day with you.
At homeless shelters and bus stations?
I'm gonna go ask these guys if they've seen Zach.
I think we'll cover more ground if we split up.
Okay.
Thanks.
Have you seen this boy?
Uh, missing kid. Anyone?
Going once...
going twice?
Oh, do you mind keeping those
and passing them out when people get their ice cream?
Huh.
What?
Well, isn't that him, over there?
Oh!
Zach! Zach!
Oh, no, no, no, no.
No, no, no, no.
Don't, don't, don't, don't. Zach!
Don't, don't. Zach, don't run away!
Wait! Come on!
Just-would you get back here?!
Come on, really! Let's just talk!
Damn it, Zach!
It's enough already.
Aah! Oh!
Uh...
nobody here has seen Zach.
But there's a halfway house
on the westside I want to check... out.
Are you okay?
I got you some ice cream.
You did?
But then I got hungry.
So then I just threwmy ice cream at him and ran.
Well, somebody say something.
Thank god you were in flats.
I'm still recovering from Mike is Zach's real father.
I should've told Mike I saw zach.
I'm a horrible person, right?
Oh, Susan, come on.
Zach attacked Felicia. He blew up your kitchen.
Evidently, he tried to kill Mike.
I think we can all agree this kid's a freak.
What do you think, bree?
Well, I think given everything that's happened,
it's perfectly justified that you'd be frightened of Zach.
But...
but Zach is Mary Alice's son.
He grew up playing in our yards.
If he has any hope of surviving,
I have to believe he's better
off here than on the streets.
I couldn't have imagined
how much going back to work would upset Parker.
Look, he's going to be fine.
He's just gotta get used
to daddy providing all the love.
I'm kidding. I'm kidding.
I am kidding.
Look, kids are resilient. He will adapt.
Tom, he attacked a teacher with an umbrella.
It was a poke. He poked her.
I don't know.
Maybe I shouldn't be working.
The kids would certainly benefit
from having two stay-at-home parents,
although buying food might become an issue.
Maybe I could change my work schedule,
try and get some flex time.
Would nina go for that?
No. No.
No,no,no!
It would help if you came up with some ideas.
How about hugs?
Hugs?
Yeah, I read in one of those family magazines
the kids are supposed to get, like, ten hugs a day.
It makes 'em feel more secure.
I say pile on the hugs.
That'll fix everything? Hugs?
Yeah. Come here.
come here.
Hey.
Hi.
It's working, isn't it?
Shut up.
Hey, buddy, you busy?
Yes. Mrs. Mulberry's reading to me.
Well, isn't she nice?
But it's time for bed, so I'm gonna tuck you in, okay?
I'll take that.
No!
I know things have been hard for you
since I started back to work,
but it is just as hard for me to be away from you.
And you just have to remember
that even when I'm not around,
my love for you is real.
You may not be able to see it,
but it's not imaginary like mrs. Mulberry.
It's real.
Okay, honey?
Mrs. Mulberry is real,
and she said you're a liar.
Parker.
Parker.
We're reading.
I don't understand.
Why can't we see each other anymore?
Because ever since I found out
what Andrew said to you,
I've been doing some soul searching,
and I realize that everything's that happened
is completely my fault.
No,no,no,
that's ridiculous. No, it's not.
All the things that Andrew's been saying
and the way he's been acting,
it's all connected to his father's death.
And it's clear to me
that I need to spend more time
focusing on him and his needs.
You know...
you're right. You do need to focus on Andrew.
Thank you, George, for being so understanding.
Of course.
So have you thought about counseling?
That place you sent him to-
that behavioral modification camp-
he got counseling there,right?
But I only sent him there
because his behavior at the time
was so completely out of bounds.
You don't think that what he
said to me was out of bounds?
I just think if I spent a lot of time with him,
it'll really help.
Why not do both?
Let him spend a few months
with some caring professionals,
and then bring him home.
You know, what he said to you was horribly rude,
but that camp, it's extreme,
and, I mean, unless I felt like Andrew was getting
really out of control,then...
well, let's hope it doesn't come to that.
You know, in spite of everything that's happened,
I really like Andrew.
Oh, George, really?
Yeah. The truth is...
he reminds me of me.
The conjugal visit rules are you got 45 minutes.
We call every 15 minutes to make sure you're still here.
You understand?
Yes, we got it.
Uh,we interrupt our love making to answer the phone,
or you call out the dogs. Okay!
I'm ready whenever you...
obviously are.
Carlos, are we gonna make it?
We just did. You want to go again?
No, I'm talking about us-
our relationship, our marriage.
Carlos, you're going to be a father.
And when you get outta here,
you're gonna need to get a job
and make an honest living for me and our child.
Babe, I've learned my lesson.
Okay, when I get out of here,
everything's gonna be different.
We're going to start over with
a new life and a great family,
and nothing is going to get in the way of that.
Hey, so you never told me-
how's the new lawyer? You like him?
yeah.
Yeah, I'm still here.
Okay, enough chitchat.
We only have 30 minutes left,
and I want to make the most of it.
Okay,please-please don't run.
I can't. I hurt my foot.
How?
I landed on it funny when
I was running away from you.
What do you want?
To talk to you.
Why?
'Cause I havea lot of things to say.
So you can just listen. I'll buy you some food.
When was the last time you ate?
My dad's alive? Where is he?
I don't know. He disappeared.
But Mike did not kill him.
I mean, he's alive, you swear?
I swear. Maybe he's in utah.
I know that he used to have a life there-
before me.
I don't know. I just-I just-
I need to get some money and find him.
Zach, you know what I think?
I think you should come back with me.
Why?
Because there are still people
at home that care about you.
And there's things
that you need to know.
Like what?
Well, I can't tell you.
You know,you messed up
a lot of people's lives, Zach.
You can't run away from that.
Do you mean Julie?
What?
I know that I messed up her life,
but I didn't mean to.
I really miss her out here.
I think about her all the time.
Yeah, well, Julie is a really special girl.
Has she said anything about me?
Because if she has, then I might
still have a chance with her.
If I come back with you,
then I-I could make it up to her.
Do you know what I think?
I think you were right.
I think you should try
to find your father first.
Yeah?
Yeah.
I mean, now that you know he's okay,
you should go to him.
He'll want to take care of you.
That's what parents do.
Let me help.
How much money do you think
you'll need to get to utah?
Daddy, I can't find mrs. Mulberry's umbrella.
Where is it?
Oh, I don't know, sport. Honey, have you seen the umbrella?
No, can't say that I have.
Okay, listen, don't worry about it.
I'm sure mrs. Mulberry's around here somewhere.
Or, uh, maybe she's not.
She could've left. You know...
maybe she had some other little boy
that she needed to help.
Like who?
I don't know. It could be a little boy in,uh...
england...
named... spencer.
Lynette?
I mean, this is conjecture on my part.
But it is possible that someone like little spencer
needs mrs. Mulberry more, 'cause he doesn't have a daddy
and a mommy who love him.
Yeah, that's it.
He's an orphan...
with no hands.
Okay?
You're so sweet. Come here.
I love you. You all right?
Okay, go get dressed.
What have you done to mrs. Mulberry?
Until there's a body, there's no evidence of a crime.
Mrs. Mulberry!
She's back!
Oh!
Goodie.
Mrs. Mulberry's back!
Oh!
She got ran over. She's dead.
Don't you worry. I'm here.
Maybe it's okay, buddy. Maybe we can call 9-1-1 or-
no, tom, she's gone.
swimmers, take your marks.
George, what are you doing here?
Don't worry, Bree, I'll be quick.
I thought about what you said, and you're right.
Andrew needs his space.
Well, thank you, George.
It's... best that I stay away.
And I completely understand
if you want to change pharmacists but...
I did want to give you a little good-bye gift.
Oh.
George!
It's my pattern! Where did you find it?
I got lucky on an online auction.
I love it! Thank you! Oh!
George?
Oh, George!
George.
Andrew, what are you doing?!
Andrew!
Get off of him, Andrew!
Stop it!
Knock it off!
Did you see him?! He was kissing her!
Oh, my god, you're bleeding.
That freak was kissing her!
I don't care. You gotta calm down now.
The world is filled with good fathers.
How do we recognize them?
They're the ones who are missed so terribly
that everything falls apart in their absence.
They're the ones who love us
long before we've even arrived.
They're the ones who come looking for us
when we can't find our way home.
hey, what's wrong?
Because of me,
my son's imaginary friend got
crushed by a garbage truck.
I am the worst person in the world.
Yes, the world is filled with good fathers...
honey, he is going to get over this in no time. Trust me.
And one day when he is all grown up,
you and Parker are going to laugh hysterically about this.
You really think so? Really?
And the best
are the ones who make the women in their lives...
I promise.
Feel like good mothers.
Previously on
"desperate housewives"...
the police dug up
your father today.
They think that somebody
was poisoning him.
Apparently, i'm a suspect.
Bree felt threatened
by the past.
Get the damn lawyer.
Are you hitting on me?
Gabrielle was threatened
by seduction.
Do you mean julie?
If i come back with you,
then i can make it up to her.
You should find your father
first. Let me help.
And while some threats...
Were kept under control...
let's get this over with.
Some were left free
to return.
Since her first day on the job,
it had been clear
to lynette scavo
that her new boss nina
was unusually tense.
To help relieve her tension,
lynette tried giving
her boss thoughtful gifts...
a soothing wave machine...
aromatherapy candles...
even meditative chi balls.
But nothing seemed to ease
nina's tension.
"Distilled
the old-fashioned way. "
You know,
it actually hurts my teeth
to say that out loud.
You folks are going to toddle
back to your little holes
and you are gonna come up
with a decent slogan
or i will can all your asses
the old-fashioned way.
Until one day
when it occurred to lynette
there was one form
of relaxation
she had yet to try.
It's a gimlet.
You'll love it.
What exactly
is your plan here,
to get me all liquored up
so i buy the revised pitch?
Don't be ridiculous.
Could we get a trough
of these, please?
I can't remember the last time
i was in a bar.
Must have been the last time
i had a boyfriend,
which was...
oh, god, i'm a nun.
So why don't you go out
and get in the game?
Believe it or not,
when it comes to meeting men,
i am... shy.
Well, i'm not.
So, uh...
what about that guy
over there?
He's been checking you out
since we walked in.
He's cute.
So go over there.
No.
Oh, for god's sakes.
Where are you going?
Lynette, sit...
hey, stretch,
see my friend over there?
She thinks you're cute.
Why don't you
buy her a drink?
Hey, everybody. Hi.
Oh, it's a beautiful morning,
isn't it?
Thank you, sweetie.
Oh, hey, lynette, i read
the new vodka proposal.
Oh, you guys hit it
out of the park.
I love that color.
Thanks. Hey, nina.
Yeah?
And although it had come about
in an unexpected manner...
aren't those the same clothes
you were wearing last night
in the bar?
Yep.
Nina's tension had finally
been released...
the old-fashioned way.

Everyone in this world
needs someone
they can depend upon,
be it a faithful companion,
trusted confidant...
or loyal friend.
For susan mayer,
that dependable someone
was her book agent
lonny moon.
It was lonny
who helped susan promote
her first children's book.
It was lonny who rushed susan
to the hospital
the night julie was born.
No, no, no, no, no!
It was lonny
who took susan's mind
off her painful divorce
with a fun vacation.
Yes, lonny was susan's rock.
Sadly for susan,
her rock was about to crumble.
for those of you
just joining us,
we have a new development
in the melanie foster case...
Lonny, what are you doing here?
It's past noon.
Which means it's now
socially acceptable
to begin drinking.
I can't believe i let you
talk me into this.
I am so behind in my work.
But i'm glad i came.
This is fun.
I've gotta be honest.
I had an ulterior motive.
Oh?
I've decided to start
my own agency.
You're leaving muir and hunt?
You helped build that place.
I know, but i just feel
it's time.
And now the question is,
will you come with me?
Well... of course.
Okay!
To the future.
I'll just call the agency,
and i'll let them know
i'm going with you.
Oh, i don't think
that's necessary.
Really?
Yeah, i think
it might be rude not to.
Lonny...
what's going on?
Okay.
There's been some bad blood
between me and the partners.
Why?
I got into this thing
where i had to move
a little client money
around temporarily
to cover some expenses.
You had to "move money"?
What does that mean?
I took a little from here,
and i moved it there.
It was no big deal.
Really?
'Cause it sort of sounds
like embezzlement.
Why do people
keep using that word?!
Who else is using
that word?
Nobody.
The partners
and their forensic accountant.
Oh, my god.
Lonny, did you "move"
some of my money?
Absolutely not.
I swear!
Susan, don't look at me
that way.
I know what i did
was wrong,
and i feel like
a complete idiot for doing it,
but please,
please don't hate me.
Well, i don't hate you.
I couldn't hate you.
You're my lonny.
So...
will you still
come with me?
You know what?
This is one of those times
when you find out
who your real friends are,
so, yeah.
Oh, thank you!
Thank you!
You are one special lady,
susan mayer.
Is that the baby's head?
No, that's his foot.
That looks like
a head to me.
Well, that settles it.
When this baby's born,
i'll be in charge
of putting on the socks.
You're glowing today,
you know that?
Pregnancy agrees with you.
Yeah?
Well, if you don't mind
the hemorrhoids and the nausea,
it's quite the party.
I wonder where david is.
He should've been here by now.
So this new lawyer's good?
He's quite the shark.
You're gonna love him.
He hasn't lost a case
in six years.
He argued in front of
the state supreme court,
and he made our conjugal visit
happen pretty damn fast.
Well, hey,
i'm a fan already.
Sorry i'm late.
Oh, david.
Good to see you, gaby.
Carlos, i'm david.
I don't think so.
What the hell
are you doing?
That guy's not gonna be
my lawyer.
Find a new one.
You haven't filed
a single charge.
Either determine a homicide
or release the body.
We've got a court order
which says,
until we're done with it,
the corpse is ours.
He is not a corpse.
He is a man
named rex van de kamp.
He was a loving husband,
a devoted father
and a successful doctor.
So successful, in fact,
that he left me enough money
to sue the city,
this precinct
and you two gentlemen
personally
just for the fun of it.
Mrs. Van de kamp, we don't
respond well to threats,
so if I...
release the body.
What?
The evidence we have
is minimal at best.
Mrs. Van de kamp
was gracious enough
to come down here
and take that lie detector test.
I think it's the least
we can do for her.
Thank you.
So, uh,
what will happen now?
Obviously, we'll put
mr. Van de kamp back
just like we found him.
Yes, and i'm sure
you will bury him
with all the dignityof a dead hamster
no, i want rex released to me
and i will make
all the arrangements.
Fine.
And, of course, you'll be
paying all the costs.
Of course.
Detective barton,
you are clearly a gentleman.
people have gathered
at attenborough high school,
where melanie attended...
no, it's fine. I'll pick 'em up
on my way home.
Okay, so what do you want?
Oh, parker hates pepperoni.
Um, how about sausage?
Yeah, and a small cheese.
Okay, perfect. Love you.
Hey, you.
Hey.
You wanna hit o'donnell's?
I owe you a beer.
Actually, i owe you
so much more than that.
You're welcome,
but i really need to get home.
Oh, come on. I had such
a good time last night.
Um, why don't you ask Trudy?
She loves going out.
Trudy? Are you kidding?
I don't need the competition.
Haveou seen trudy
without her jacket? She's hot.
Oh, is she now?
Oh, I-i didn't mean
that you're not... hot.
I just... you're married.
You know,
you're off the market.
I don't have to worry
about fighting you for guys.
Come on, Lynette.
Just one quick little drink.
I was actually
starting to think
that you and i
were becoming pals.
Pals? 'cause sometimes
it's hard to tell.
You know, i wasn't feeling
the love today
when you mocked my campaign
in front of the clients.
That was just
putting on a show for work.
In the future, always assume
that i am winking inside.
Come on.
I hate to go to a bar alone.
I feel like such a loser.
Okay. One drink.
Yeah! One or two.
No.
Thank you so much
for bringing my mail over.
You know, i have some
of yours in the kitchen.
Well, that's the fourth time.
What's up with this postman?
Oh, i know.
He used to be great.
Then he had this stroke,
and, well,
now we're lucky if he
doesn't drool on the coupons.
But feel free to snoop around.
I'll be right back.
Now for those of you
just joining us,
families in chicago breathed
a sigh of relief today
as an arrest was finally made
in the brutal attack
on local high school student
melanie foster.
But word
of the suspect's capture
comes as small comfort to the foster family...
Betty?
...who lost their
17-year-old daughter
almost four months ago.
Betty?
The victim's body was
discovered in a local park
less than a mile
from attenborough high.
Did you see the news?
They've arrested somebody.
Yeah. Looks like
we're in the clear.
Well, i have some good news.
The police have finally released
rex's body.
About time.
You must be so relieved.
You know,
mostly i'm just annoyed
that the whole thing
happened in the first place.
I mean, how in the world could
anybody accuse me of murder?
Well, you are wound
pretty tight.
What? The supermom is always
the first to snap.
They've done studies.
Anyway, i was hoping
that you were all free
friday morning,
because that's when i'm going
to be hosting the reburial.
The what?
Look, i know it's an imposition,
but danielle is away
on a class trip,
and andrew is back
at camp hennessey
for a little refresher course.
Well, it's just gonna be
a very brief
and dignified ceremony,
and i was hoping that
you could say a few words,
and, um,
i'm gonna read a poem.
We would love to come.
Absolutely.
I'm busy. Sorry.
edie!
She's going to read a poem.
Fine. Yes, yes,
we'd all love to come.
Well, thank you.
You don't know how much
this means to me.
I realize looking back
that i was still in shock
during rex's first funeral.
I don't think it had quite
hit me yet what had happened,
so that's why this small
ceremony means so much to me,
because i realize now that...
this is the last chance
i'm gonna have to say good-bye.
Unless, of course,
they dig him up again.
Sure, there was times when
lisa was rude and obnoxious,
but i know now that
that was no excuse
to always be beatin' on her.
Oh, baby, i'm so sorry.
Good job, you two.
This is an example of how to use
incarceration to your benefit.
It's a chance for people
to take a step back
and observe the obstacles
they face in their marriage.
Can i go now?
'Cause i have a lot to say
about the obstacles i'm facing
in my marriage.
We don't got any obstacles.
Yes, we do, lamar.
We got big ones.
Okay, hold on, you two.
I think that it's
carlos and gabrielle's turn.
Thanks, but we're good.
this is your third group session,
but you have yet
to share anything.
Come on. Talk to us.
How's your marriage?
Shaky at best.
And why is that?
I don't know.
I hired a brilliant lawyer
to get my husband
out of this hehole,
and he fired him
for no reason at all.
Carlos?
I just didn't like him.
Why not? He's experienced,
he's intelligent,
he's successful.
Exactly.
I'd prefer an attorney you
didn't find so damn appealing.
Oh, my god. You fired him
because you're jealous?
Don't i have the right to?
You know, she cheated on me.
Oh, bob, you beat your wife.
You are so not allowed to gasp.
Don't you talk that way to him.
One more word out of you, lisa,
and i will backhand you myself.
Okay, calm down.
Thousands of fat, bald attorneys
out there in the world,
and she's goa get the one that
looks like an underwear model.
I'm not discussing this
anymore.
You can rot in here
for all i care.
So, um...
mona, what do you feel
are the biggest problems
in your marriage?
By the way,
he was wearing a suit.
How do you know
he had a good body?
Do you know?
No!
I bet he's hot.
Do i need to say what
our biggest problem is,
or can everybody figure it out
for themselves?
Why are you reading
that contract?
I told you. Lonny wants me
to sign with this new agency.
But you didn't say
you were seriously thinking
about going with him.
I know, i know.
Just lonny's family.
You know, he's always
been there for me.
He paid my rent
when i was waiting
for my first royalty check.
He called me every day
when karl left.
I mean, i just owe him
so much.
Susan,
he committed a felony.
Okay, who in this room
has not committed a felony?
Raise your hand.
Ah-ah-ah, not so fast.
Your agent represents you.
You've gotta be able
to trust him.
How is that gonna be
possible now?
Well, it's possible because
i have faith in people.
I mean, lonny knows
he messed up,
and he's sorry.
He's making restitution.
What, you don't believe people
deserve second chances?
Not when they messed up
this much, no.
Really? So that's it with you?
You just get one shot,
and you screw up,
and you're out?
I didn't know
you were such a cynic.
Hey, i'm sorry, all right?
I guess it's just
the way i'm wired.
I got a job
over in greenwood,
so i'll call you
later tonight.
You okay?
Julie...
i did something bad,
something really, really bad.
Aren't you gonna ask me
what it was?
Do i ever have to?
Last week when Mike and I
went to the park
searching for zach,
i sort of found him.
No!
Yes, and i gave him money
and i sent him away,
and i didn't tell mike.
Holy crap.
What are you gonna do?
I don't know. What would you do
if this happened to you?
See, this would never
happen to me.
This kind of thing
only happens to you.
Will you stop judging
and help me?
Well, obviously,
you're gonna have to tell him.
Well, i can't do that.
You heard what he said
about his wiring.
I betrayed him.
He'll never forgive me.
Okay. Don't tell him.
Well, how can i not?
I feel so guilty,
i can barely look him in the eye
when he talks about zach.
So where do you think
zach went?
Utah.
Oh, lord.
Why did i do this?
I have a feeling
you did it for me.
Hey, girl. I hope you are
in the mood for margaritas
'cause it is salsa night
at o'donnell's.
Oh, fun. But i can't go tonight
because i promised the twins
that i would help them
finish their science project.
Lynette, if the late hours
are going to be an issue
for you,
we probably should
talk about finding you
a less demanding account.
You're gonna
take me off kamarov
because i won't go
drinking with you?
No. Oh, god, no.
Honey, i get it.
You have a family.
Home has to come first
for you.
Thank you.
I mean, for me,
the client comes first.
Me being a perfectionist
is my own neurotic issue,
and i know that i really
need to work on that.
But trust me,
i will never sleep again
if this campaign gets
mucked up.
I'll figure something out.
You go home. Have a good night.
Nina?
Yeah.
I can handle the extra hours.
Oh, Lynette. You sure?
Yeah.
I'll get my coat.
Wow, this place is rowdy
after happy hour, huh?
Yeah.
Hey... look at that guy
right there.
The end of the bar.
The shoulders
with the tan jacket.
Yeah.
Go get him for me.
Hey there.
So they're going on about
melanie foster on the news.
It's time we talked about her,
caleb.
Until you start accepting
responsibility
for what happened,
you know i can't let you
out of here.
What the hell is this?!
Mom!
Where are you?!
I'll be right back.
And i will expect you
to answer me.
Where are you?!
I'm coming! Coming.
What were you gonna do with this?
Don't.
"I know who really killed
melanie foster.
"You've arrested
the wrong man"?
What are you thinking?
The police need to know
the truth.
The hell they do!
This is our chance.
We are good people.
We can't let
an iocent man go to jail.
Okay, you wanna do
the right thing?
Well, then call 9-1-1
and tell 'em
you got a killer
locked up in the basement.
He is not a killer.
He was confused.
He didn't know
what he was doing.
He knows a lot more than
you give him credit for.
I'm mailing the letter.
Do you realize
what's gonna happen?
Mom, are you
thinking it through?
I'm mailing the letter.
If you do, you'd better hope
to god they don't find us.
'Cause they're not gonna care
how slow caleb is.
They'll just execute him.
Lonny?
Are you here? It's susan.
Lonny?
Susan?
What are you doing here?
Well, i just came over
to give you the contracts.
Your door was open.
Oh. Great.
Sorry this place
is such a mess.
I've been working here till
we get the new offices painted.
Wait till you see them.
They're gonna be
really beautiful.
Where's jeannie?
She's with the kids
up in minnesota
visiting her mom.
They love it up there.
Keep changing the date
on dear old dad.
There's no electricity.
There isn't?
Oh, i'm such a dummy.
I've been...
i've been so swamped,
i must have forgotten
to pay the electric bill.
Lonny...
how much financial trouble
are you really in?
I'm fine.
You know what it is?
I had to pay all those people
back at the same time...
restitution plus interest.
It's not something
i'd recommend.
It sucks you dry.
I've gonna ask you
a question,
and i want you
to tell me the truth.
Did you steal from me?
Absolutely not.
Please don't lie.
Just tell me.
Is that what you want
to hear?
Do i have to say it
so that we can move on?
Fine. I did it.
But yours was
the first money i paid back,
so the slate's
been wiped clean.
Let's just move past it.
Suze?
I'm sorry. I just can't
trust you anymore.
Yes, you can!
No can't.
You can.
Can't.
Give me the contract!
No!
Okay, okay, fine.
Aah! What are you doing?!
Are you trying
to take me down with you?!
I am not going down!
My life is great!
I have never been happier,
and i've never been thinner!
Get off me, you amazon!
What are you doing here?
You left me a message.
You said you wanted to talk.
Yeah, i thought you'd schedule
an appointment later.
Right now i'm sort of
disgusting and sweaty.
I'm a criminal lawyer.
I've seen worse.
So did you find a new lawyer
for mr. Charming?
I don't want a new lawyer.
I want you.
So does carlos.
He just doesn't realize it yet.
A 1988 roman\e-conti la t鈉he.
I'm impressed.
Look, to be honest, carlos is
a little threatened by you.
He thinks if we spend
too much time together,
that something...
might happen.
Somebody's got
an active imagination.
Corkscrew?
David, we're not here
to drink wine, okay?
This is business.
Now you have to convince
carlos that he can trust you.
How am i gonna do that?
I don't know. Tell him you're
happily married or... or gay.
yeah, right.
You're a lawyer. You lie to juries all the time.
Can't you just make something up?
I'm past the point in my career
where i have to beg for work.
I'm sorry.
Okay, david, i'm holding my marriage
together by my fingernails.
If carlos serves his full sentence, i don't
think we're gonna make it, so please, i need you.
I'll say this much for carlos.
He's got excellent taste...
in wine. Montrachet.
It's good stuff.
Are you gonna help me
or not?
We'll go see carlos tomorrow.
I'll turn him around for you.
Really?
What are you gonna say?
Play it by ear. I don't wanna
sound too over-rehearsed.
Hey, that's my wine.
Deduct it from my bill.
It all started with
bad real estate investments.
You should have just
come clean.
Yeah, well, you tell one lie,
the second one comes easy.
Then you're making up new lies
to cover up the old ones.
Pretty soon,
you can't turn back, you know?
I do.
When jeannie finally caught on,
she took the kids.
She took the furniture.
The bank locked me
out of my own house.
That's why i can't lose you
as a client.
Well, i'm sorry,
but you have.
I don't blame you.
You'll never lose
my friendship, though.
I mean that.
Really?
Of course.
You're my lonny.
And you're my susie.
You're my susie.
Oh! What the hell
is wrong with you?!
I'm your lonny.
That's what you said.
Not like that.
But i thought...
i mean, there's always
been this magnetism.
No, there has not been,
and there never will be!
Oh, my god!
But i was just coming clean!
Hey, morgan!
Got a letter from some guy
claiming he attacked Melanie Foster.
You ran me down for that?
I got dozens of kooks
coming out of the woodwork,
all saying we arrested
the wrong guy.
This one knows
about the axe.
Here you go,
mrs. Van de kamp.
Thank you.
The hearse is right outside,
so if you'll just
follow me...
oh, shoot. There's a form
i need you to sign.
I think i left it
back in the office.
That's all right. I'll wait.
Okay.
I'm here, sweetheart,
and i'm gonna take care
of everything.
But you knew that,
didn't you?
You've always known
that you can count on me.
Mrs. Van de kamp.
Detective barton,
what are you doing here?
Oh, just taking care
of some business.
Is this...
yes. This is rex.
I I wanna thank you again
for what you did.
It was so refreshing
to be treated with kindness
after weeks of just
ludicrous accusations.
The doctor doesn't think
they're ludicrous.
Well, i know,
but rex died in his care.
I mean, of course he'd like
to blame someone else.
But the tests he did,
uh...
oh, please don't talk to me
about tests.
Rex was not poisoned,
and no one i know
believes that he was.
Rex did.
What?
Well, the doctor told rex
he was being poisoned,
and rex believed him.
How would you know that?
Where did you get this?
We found that in rex's bed
after he died.
That is his handwriting,
isn't it?
You know what i think?
Rex felt guilty
for the way he treated you.
The adultery,
the public humiliations.
That's why he forgave you.
He understood why you did it.
How could
he have believed this?
Look, my wife cheated on me,
too.
I know how much it hurts.
And so will a judge.
Everyone understands
crimes of passion.
But every day
that you stonewall
makes you look
more and more
like a cold,
calculating killer.
We both know
that's not you.
But i can't help you unless
you start telling the truth.
I'm sorry, but I-i, um,
i have to go.
I have some things
that i need to take care of.
Bree, it is obvious your husband
loved you very much.
Don't you think you owe to him
to admit the truth?
Detective, i know exactly
what my husband deserves.
Now would you be a dear?
Thank you.
What's he doing here?
I have a pitch for you.
I wanna explain to you
why i think it's in your best
interest for you to allow me
to represent you.
Oh, for pete's sake, carlos,
at least listen to the man.
I guess it beats
sitting in my cell.
Now i don't think you have
a problem with me as a lawyer.
Clearly, i'm the real deal.
I sense your problem
with me is more personal.
You sense right.
You wanna know if i'm interested
in sleeping with yr wife.
And the answer is yes.
He... carlos, he's kidding.
Tell him you're kidding.
Shut it.
Now clearly, gabrielle's willful,
self-centered and manipulative.
She's also beautiful enough
to be worth the trouble.
So the minute we leave this room,
i'm going to aggressively pursue her,
and when i succeed, which i will, we're
gonna fly to my chateau in chamonix
and have dinner in a local bistro. They
make the best raclette in all of europe.
We'll make love by the fire and afterwards
do a little midnight skiing.
You ski, don't you?
You're athletic.
You'll learn.
Anyway, all of this
only happens if you fire me.
If you keep me on
as your lawyer,
your wife's off-limits.
I'd get disbarred for sleeping
with a client's wife,
and nobody's worth that,
not even her.
So that's my pitch.
I'll let you think about it.
Honey, i am so sorry. Honestly,
that guy's insane.
Boy, you just can't wait,
can you?
What?
He's my lawyer.
But, carlos...
and that's all
there is to it.
how about a dance?
How about it? Yes.
Well, you guys have fun.
This is the fifth night
in a row
i haven't been home
to tuck in my kids,
so i'm gonna go.
No. You're gonna stay put.
It is friday night,
and you have all weekend
to play with your kids.
Watch my purse.
Hey.
I'm chuck.
Chuck, i'm gonna stop you
right there.
Happily married.
Well...
looks like we have got
something in common.
Chuck?
Get your hand
off my thigh.
No, not up my thigh.
Off it.
Come on!
What's the matter with you?
I'm not available.
And i'm not that easy!
Well, what are you doing in
a pick-up bar at 10:30 at night?
Well, i don't usually
do this.
Oh, come on, honey,
who are you kidding?
I've seen you here every night
this week. You're a regular.
At that moment
it occurred to lynette
that chuck,
though inebriated,
had a valid point.
The time had come
to declare
a war of independence.
And the surest path to victory
would require
an aggressive campaign
of shock...
and awe.
it's crazy here tonight.
Don't you want
to dance?
No, thanks. I think
i'll sit this one out.
Lynette savored her victory
confident that she would
never again
have to engage her opponent
on this particular battlefield.
Ooh! I love this song.
Here, hold my purse.
Bree, where have you been?
We were starting to get worried.
Oh, i'm sorry. I was just attending
to some last minute details.
Right this way.
Where are we going?
To rex's gravesite.
Well, i thought that
this was his gravesite.
I'm changing it.
Why?
Well, he did something to
upset me, and i want him gone.
What did he do?
You know, it's so unpleasant.
I'd rather not get into it.
Have you seen these gravestones?
Some are from the 1800s.
Just fascinating.
Bree, wait, you're gonna
have to explain.
Rex is dead. What could
he have done to upset you?
My husband, the man i spent
my life with for 18 years,
died thinking
that i murdered him.
What?
Yes, the cardiologist shared
this moronic theory with Rex.
And rex believed him!
Are you sure?
Yes, because he left a note
and it said, and i quote,
"bree, i understand.
And i forgive you. "
I spent 18 years of my life
with this man.
How could he not know me?
I have done nothing
to be forgiven for!
I was a fantastic wife!
When he was sick,
i nursed him.
When we were low on money,
i stayed within a budget.
I cooked his meals.
I mended his clothes.
For the love of god, i used
to check his back for acne.
And that miserable
son of a bitch
has the nerve to understand
and forgive me?
Well, the joke's on him,
because i do not understand,
and i do not forgive.
Hi. We're...
we're just going to a funeral.
Right this way.
Honey, i know you're hurt,
but are you sure
you're not gonna
change your mind?
I mean, there's no
turning back after this.
If you think i'm gonna
lay next to someone for eternity
who thinks i'm a murderer,
you're crazy.
As far as i'm concerned,
let him decompose
with strangers.
Everyone in the world needs
someone they can depend on,
be they faithful friends,
determined advocates...
or a loving family.
But occasionally in life,
the people we thought would
always be there for us, leave.
And if that happens,
it's amazing the lengths
'll go to...
to get them back.
Previously on Desperate Housewives:
My husband died thinking that I murdered him!
Bree put the past behind her,
If you keep me on as your lawyer, your wife's off limits.
He's my lawyer.
while Carlos gambled with his future,
How much money do you think you need to get to Utah?
Susan interfered with a family reunion.
George Williams had never been lucky in love.
It seemed that the women he dated always invented reasons
not to consummate their relationship.
Um...
I'm afraid we'd wake my roommate.
Uh, I have to get up really early for work.
I'm, uh  saving myself  for  marriage.
Sadly for George, it was one unoriginal excuse after another.
But since he'd started seeing Bree Van De Kamp,
George couldn't help but feel:
Hi!
Kids are gone. We have the house all to ourselves tonight.
His luck was about to change.
I thought the duck turned out well.
Although that sauce was a little bit thick;
but judging by how many helpings you had, I think I got away with it.
What are you thinking about?
Your hair.
Would you mind if I -?
Uh, no.
Go ahead.
That better?
That was nice.
It's OK that I'm doing this, right?
Well, I thought we were going to let the duck digest a bit more,
but  what the heck!
Oh!
What's wrong?
I don't know. I felt something weird.
Och.
That was my tongue. It extends farther than most. I should have warned you.
No, it wasn't your kiss. I felt something weird on my neck.
What are you doing?
I don't know, I'm just really starting to itch.
What is it?
You  you got a huge rash!
It's starting to spread to my face!
Are you allergic to something you ate?
I don't think so. I made Duck ?I'Orange a thousand times.
Something is causing that rash.
Bree. Bree, please don't.
I'm sorry, George, but you have to go.
But the kids are away!
I was sort of hoping we could make love tonight.
How are we going to do that, George? You have just given me hives!
Though painful to hear, George had to admit:
At least this excuse was original.
season 2 episode 6
"I Wish I Could Forget You"
It's a fact that little girls dream of big white weddings.
Of course, the exact same thing can be said for big girls,
some of whom can get incredibly anxious
waiting for the boys in their lives
to make those dreams come true.
Watch it, Suzie!
Mom, why don't you just go see a dressmaker?
Wait. I have the perfect idea.
You get in the dress,
and I'll pin it.
We wear the same size.
Since when?
Since forever!
You have to leave, though. You can't stay.
You can't see Suzie in a wedding dress.
Not until your big day!
Mom!
No, it's not a problem.
I can see her in it.
You can?
I assume you want to pick out your own wedding dress when we get married, right?
Oh! That sounds like a proposal!
Did it?
Yeah, it did.
Huh, what do you know.
Are you planning to pop the question?
If she knows it's coming, the question won't really pop, will it?
He's right, Mom.
No, I want to do it just like you do.
You know, on your own terms, and you get down on one knee, and the whole production.
That's a plan.
Well, then I can wait. I can wait. I'm a good waiter.
Good.
Just wondering -
if there's a ballpark of how long I will have to wait.
A week? A month? After lunch?
Again, you're not waiting for the pop.
Right. I'm sorry.
Get down on one knee!
Mom.
So the hives occurred right after you kissed George?
Yes, it was the strangest thing.
And so inconvenient.
To be honest, I think we were  about to make love for the first time.
Bree, have you considered the idea
that your subconscious mind was trying to sabotage your evening with George?
Actually, I have not considered that, because that's -
idiotic.
You don't think being with George made you feel a bit guilty?
Why should I feel guilty?
Perhaps you felt you were about to commit adultery.
Dr Goldfine, Rex is dead.
You can't cheat on a corpse.
Maybe that's not how you really feel deep down.
Oh, so you think I'm crazy?
You say you got a case of hives for no reason.
I think there is a reason, and it's probably a psychosomatic one.
You can think whatever you want,
but to be honest, I don't believe in the subconscious.
Everytime you've said "Rex" in this session,
you stroked the placed where your wedding ring used to be.
Why did you do that?
Let's talk about Monday.
We are re-pitching to the Kamaroff people.
Lynette, you'll be on point.
Great. No problem.
And can you do me a favor and maybe not wear the green suit?
Umm -
I  wasn't planning to, but  why?
The fabric.
It just has this quality to it,
like you could  I don't know  wipe it clean with a damp cloth.
I'll just wear a different suit then.
Great.
Like what, you think?
Another suit. I have other suits.
And if by other suits you mean the grey one,
then of course you do.
No, actually I have quite a few others, uh -
the blue one, and, uh -
What's wrong with the blue suit?
Stu!
Would you like to tell Lynette what's wrong with the blue suit?
No. It's cool.
Stu! Come on.
Do the thing. The thing that you did at lunch.
"Look at me, I'm Lynette!"
"Oh, got food stains everywhere!"
All right.
So if I get my blue suit dry-cleaned, would that be acceptable to everyone?
The pants also have a split seam in the back.
Excuse me.
Hello David.
What the hell is this? I thought I told you to dress maternal.
Yes you did, and I considered it for about a second.
What happened?
David, I know you're the lawyer and all, but if you ask me:
It's never a smart strategy to cover this up.
We've got 40 minutes before the pre-trial hearing.
Let's go home and get you changed.
What?
You want to get your husband out fo jail?
Got to dress like a pregnant, suffering wife, not the cover of Vogue.
David.
Louis. What are you doing here?
I need a favor, David.
If this has to do with lifting my client's restraining order, the answer's the same as last week.
You don't understand. I'd love Crystal.
We all love the pretty ladies at the Stop & Shop,
but now you've got to love her from 50 yards away.
You turned her against me!
If it wasn't for you, we'd be together.
Louis, Crystal hired me to keep you away from her.
She doesn't want to see you.
Oh yeah? Then why did she ask for my phone number?
She's a cashier. You paid by check. It doesn't make you special.
Don't walk away from me! We're having a conversation!
Louis, this is your problem:
You're creepy. Nobody likes you.
What you call a conversation, the rest of us call harassment.
You want a friend? Get a hamster.
David!
He's got a weapon!
Call the police!
Stay there!
That's right, you'd better run!
I'm going to get some b*** come after you!
Freeze!
Hey. Everything's cool.
Are you OK?
Weeds are a common annoyance of life in Suburbia;
and no matter how hard we try to get rid of them,
they always tend to crop back up.
Are you seeing this?!
I don't believe him! He is so brazen!
Just mowing the lawn, like nothing ever happened!
What should we do? Should we call the police?
Well, Susan did say that he murdered Mrs Huber. So my vote would be, yes.
Oh my God, Susan's home.
Has she seen Paul yet?
I think so.
Hello Susan.
Oh my God. Paul.
Need some help with those bags?
Why  what are you doing here?
This is where I live.
I came home to find my son.
Here you go.
Don't come near me!
I'm just giving you back your pie filling.
I don't want my pie filling!
Oh come on, just take it.
No! Stop!
Put that pie filling down!
Slowly!
I'm calling 911.
You don't want to do that.
Oh, I think I do. You're a cold-blooded murderer.
Susan, how can you believe that? We've been neighbors for years.
Ladies, good to see you.
Paul, we've called the police.
You didn't really need to do that.
We know what you did to Mrs Huber.
Wonderful.
I see you've all turned into Susan while I've been gone.
Oh, thank God they're here.
What's going on?
Meyer's convinced that Paul Young murdered Martha Huber.
I live right behind him!
I know. I gave him my house keys to feed my cat!
I win. I made out with him.
Here, mister.
There's no warrant here for Paul Young.
Why don't you ask Mike? He overheard everything, right?
Who's Mike?
He's my boyfriend. He told me that Paul confessed everything to him.
And Mike has Martha's journals, which clearly prove that Paul had a motive.
Where do I find this Mike guy?
He's  follow me.
Do you mind if I stay here? I've got a lot of raking to do.
Let's go.
Hey.
What's going on?
Mike -
Paul Young is back.
Look.
Your girlfriend said Mr Young confessed a murder to you?
Um -
No. Not to me.
And I don't suppose you have a journal that belonged to a Martha Huber?
No. I hardly knew her.
Besides, have you ever known a woman who'd loan out her diary?
Mike, what are you doing?
I'm sorry, Susan, I don't know what you're talking about.
But I've got a job to get to. Is there anything else?
No, that pretty much covers it.
Well, someone might as well say it.
Susan, what the hell have you been smoking?
OK.
Wow! Nice!
Oh my God.
Don't be distracted by that. Look at me.
Here I am, making my presentation.
You see?
You see how it moves with me?
That's where the magic is!
Nine  hundred  dollars.
Well, this one was the most expensive. The other one's aren't as nice.
But look!
Look at me! Watch.
I don't walk in it. I glide.
Honey, there's got to be like $3,000 worth of clothes here!
Well, I haven't bought a new suit in six years.
So?
When I was working, you don't think I would have loved to have a designer suit?
I wore Wash'n'Wear.
So that we can live in a nice neighborhood.
So we could take the kids on vacation every summer.
I mean, I made sacrifices.
I'm willing to make sacrifices.
Great. Let's start here. Because -
this should cover a math tutor for Parker.
Whoa, hold on a sec.
Six months of pre-school for Penny.
Now you're being ridiculous.
And the twins, they're going to need braces.
That ought to make a dent.
Oh, no. Come on, Tom, not this one.
Strip.
You saw the walk, right?
You want to see the walk again?
I'll tutor Parker myself!
That'd be great. Are you also going to take up on dentistry?
Fine, I'll take them back.
Could you step out for a minute, please?
I want to be alone with it for a little while.
Hi, it's Bree!
Hi.
I was thinking about calling you.
I just got some new antihistamines in at the store, I think they will help with your rash.
Well, great. Um -
How would you think about the two of us checking in to a romantic hotel tomorrow?
What? Uh -
I'd like that very much.
I will let you make all the arrangements.
Something out of town would be nice.
Good night!
We need to talk.
Where did you come from?
I'm sorry, I've been waiting for you.
I'm just a little upset, because everybody thinks I'm crazy.
Can I at least get out of the truck first?
Yes.
I can understand why you wouldn't want the cops to know that you kidnapped Paul.
That definitely looks bad.
Since I was on probation -
Right, there's that.
and in possession of a gun -
Well, OK.
which I held to his head.
So I violated my probation, committed a felony, and coerced a confession.
If the cops found out about that, I'd be looking at 10-15 years.
But why don't you want them to know about Martha Huber's journal?
She says right in there that she was blackmailing Paul's wife!
She also says right in there that she was blackmailing you, for burning down Edie's house.
Oh. I forgot about that.
Just can't believe it!
There he is, a murderer, living right on our street.
And there's nothing we can do about it,
because you're a convicted felon, and I've burned down that stupid house.
It's not fair.
I want Paul Young gone as badly as you do.
And he will be.
But I also want to find Zach.
Once Zach finds out Paul's here, I got the feeling he'll be back.
It's comforting to know there's this silver lining.
Hi.
What are you doing here?
Well, you protected me from the hail of gunfire,
so I thought I'd stop by and give you a card.
You're my first visitor.
What do you mean, I'm your first visitor? You've been here two days.
My office sent me flowers.
Oh.
"Dear David. Who knew you could actually bleed? Sincerely, your stunned co-workers. "
Well, I'm a lawyer who got shot. Everybody's cracking wise.
You're not going to eat?
Uh  can't really cut yet.
Well, I'm not going to let you starve to death.
Besides, you're going to need your strength to get my husband out of jail.
You know, when I was waiting for the ambulance the other day,
I felt like I was going to die.
I was scared.
Of course you were.
Thanks.
For what?
For not making any jokes.
Sure.
Now, open up.
Here.
Thank you.
Just follow this hallway, straight down there, and make yourselves comfortable.
For the good of their family, Lynette had made a promise to her husband.
And within ten days from the date of purchase, she intended to keep it.
Oh! That's a fantastic suit.
Hm, thanks!
I'm flattered, really.
I mean, who knew you cared so much about what I think.
I don't follow you?
I make a few innocent comments, and you go out and buy yourself a gorgeous new suit.
Dance, puppet, dance!
Well, actually, this was already in my closet. I just forgot about it.
Forgot?
You forgot that you had that suit?
Good morning!
Good morning.
Hi! I'm Lynette Scavo.
Now, is everyone taken care of, in terms of coffee and whatever else they may like?
Great! Well, then let's get started.
I will show you how Kamaroff vodka can expand its customer mindshare
while still holding the line on marketing costs.
It's something we here at Parcher & Murphy like to call "persuasive engineering".
Lynette.
Hold on one second.
You have a -
They put the price tags on the skirts these days too.
Just so you know.
Look at that, everybody.
Lynette just bought herself a beautiful, brand new suit.
Doesn't she look great?
Go on.
OK.
You may be seated.
Good to see you back on your feet, Mr Bradley.
Whenever you're ready.
Thank you, Your Honor.
The defence moves to dismiss this case immediately on the grounds that the defendant -
Are you all right, Mr Bradley?
I'm sorry, Your Honor, I just can't.
I just can't.
Mr Bradley, do you need a recess?
What the hell's going on?
David, where are you going?!
I'm sorry. I quit.
You can't just quit in the middle of a hearing!
I'd love to get your idiot husband out of jail, but I just can't do it, sorry.
Why not?
Because I'm in love with you.
What?
The other day in the hospital,
I started to feel something that maybe was there all along.
When I look into your eyes I know you feel it too.
We belong together.
David, if you don't get back in there right now, I will go get a gun and shoot you myself.
I can't.
I'm sorry.
Come in!
We need to talk.
Paul!
You can't just walk into people's houses!
Susan, you told me to come in.
That's 'cause I asssumed you were someone I would let into my house.
What do you want?
I was looking through my mail, and I found this.
I was surprised to discover that you were looking for my son.
You didn't happen to find anything out about where Zach might be, did you?
No, I didn't.
Sorry I can't help you out.
I'm asking because, if you remember, Zach hid here in this house before.
And now I learn that you'd been searching for him.
Well, he's not here.
Hm.
Or maybe we should doublecheck?
He's not here! I swear!
What are you grabbing for?
A knife.
I just want to slice some tomatoes.
I don't know how I know this, but I think that he's in Utah.
He took a bus to Bountiful. You have family there, right?
OK, I gave him the bus fare.
You might want to be careful with that.
You seem a little jittery.
Look, I know the timing is bad.
Pretty bad.
I feel terrible!
How was I supposed to know
tat he would take the bullet, and suddenly realize he's in love with me?
I know I pushed you into hiring that creep.
But I promise I will do anything I can to fix this.
All right, go have sex with Bradley.
What?
That's what you want me to say, isn't it?
God, you guys are good.
You set me up perfectly.
You think David and I planned this so we could sleep together?
Let's see. The guy tells me to my face that he wants to get in your pants.
That's a week before my trial.
And now you can't wait to do anything to get him back?
Yeah.
I'd like to go back to jail now!
How dare you think that of me?
I have been nothing but faithful to you!
...since you've been in here.
Save it.
I know when I've been outfoxed.
And please don't pretend that you're doing this for me.
'Cause I'd rather rot in here.
And you know what, a lesser woman would let you rot in here.
But I'm not going to do that. I'm not going to give you the satisfaction.
So you better start packing up your shanks, or whatever you people make in here.
Because you're coming on with me!
I don't have any shanks.
Good afternoon.
Checking in?
Yes.
The reservation's in the name of Williams, George Williams.
Let me get your paperwork.
So what do you want to do first?
I don't know, I thought maybe we could go antiquing.
I hear you have some lovely museums nearby. Do you have any brochures?
Right over there, Mrs Williams.
Oh, uh  she's not my wife.
I'm so sorry.
So I hear they have that terrific farmers' market nearby. We should pick up some nectarines.
George -
I can't.
What?
I can't stay in the hotel room with you.
Why not?
Because I'm starting to get that rash again.
Well, I brought the antihistamines!
Oh please. It's not going to help, George.
Clearly, this is psychosomatic.
We need to go home.
Bree, we just drove 3 hours to get here.
I know, and you have every right to be mad,
but George, I'm really starting to itch!
Is there a problem?
Uh, no, there's no problem, everything is fine.
OK. I'll get you your own room.
George.
No. We can still have a nice weekend. We'll just shift the focus to antiquing.
Please. Clearly, you didn't come here to shop.
No, I came to spend time with you. Time that does not need to be spent in a bed.
Really? You mean that? You wouldn't mind?
No.
No, George, we're going to have a great time.
There's tons of fun stuff we can do that doesn't involve sex.
You betcha.
I'll take care of this. Why don't you go get those brochures.
OK.
George! You won't believe it!
It just stopped itching!
How about that!
Nice suit.
Just hear me out.
I was going to take it back, I swear it.
But?
But then I started thinking about it, and you know what?
I'll be damned if I'm going to pitch to a roomful of people
who are all wearing Armani and Vera Wang,
while I'm standing there with two-year-old breast milk crusted on my lapel!
Lynette!
And you know what else?
I kicked ass in that meeting because of this suit!
Lynette, it is a suit! Why are you so obsessed with it?
You can't explain obsession, Tom. It just is.
Look. We are parents. We can't afford the luxury of obsessions.
See, that's where I think we have been making a terrible, terrible mistake.
What is this?!
Sometimes we just need to get something that makes us happy.
I know that sounds selfish, but I've been thinking:
It might make us better people.
And maybe even better parents.
No.
No, Lynette, no.
This is wrong.
Carbon fiber shaft.
Wow!
I feel like a better parent already.
Oh yeah.
So I was talking to one of the bellmen,
and he said there's a place not far from here where we could go horseback-riding.
Doesn't that sound like fun?
George?
What? I-I'm sorry.
I was saying, I think we should go horseback-riding.
Oh. Sure, that-that'd be great.
What's wrong?
Nothing, I just don't think that we should risk you getting another rash.
I'm not going to get a rash just by holding your hand.
You never know.
Oh. Well, OK.
Hey, uh -
I brought those antihistamines with me.
Maybe you should take a couple, just to see if it works.
Oh. I'm drinking wine. I don't think you're supposed to mix pills with alcohol.
That's for people who are about to use heavy machinery.
You don't plan on operating a forklift tonight, do you?
You're the pharmacist. If you think it's OK -
I do.
George, I can't feel my legs!
I know, sweetheart. Don't you worry.
I'm not taking you around. I'm going to get you into bed.
Is she going to be OK?
Yes. She's just had a little too much wine.
I don't thinggit was the wine, George, I thinggit was the annyhistamines.
She doesn't know what she's -
We're good, thank you.
No, no, no.
I'll get those. You just relax.
I love you very much, Bree. You know that, right?
Uh-huh. I know.
And I want  more than anything -
if you could love me back.
You understand what I'm saying?
Bree?
Hey there.
How are you feeling?
O K.
Have you been sitting there all this time?
I wanted to make sure you were OK.
So I stayed and watched you sleep.
Did I do anything embarrassing? Sometimes I snore.
No. You slept like an angel.
In fact, you were so beautiful and peaceful I actually started to feel guilty.
Guilty?
Well, you know, 'cause I told you to take those pills.
That chair looks so uncomfortable. Why didn't you sleep next to me?
No. You made it pretty clear that you don't want me in your bed.
George.
I know what you want from me,
and I  thought I wanted the same thing,
but I keep getting those rashes, because -
I still feel married.
That makes sense, I guess.
Can't you just be patient?
Can't you wait just a little bit longer?
I've already waited my whole life for you.
And I can wait a little more.
But let's be honest:
There's no guarantee that you'll ever be ready.
There's only so much rejection I can take.
So I'll do my best, -
but don't be surprised if one of these days, you wake up and I'm not here.
Now I should get back to my room, try to get a little sleep.
The antique stores open at 10.
George, wait!
Please don't go.
Stay here with me.
But what if you get another rash?
Well, I'll just have to get over it, won't I?
Gabrielle?
I got your call.
Wow.
Does this mean what I think it means?
There are some ground rules first:
I'm not leaving my husband.
Carlos is looking at spending 8 years in jail, because of my lapse of judgment with the gardener.
I can't let him rot in there. I'd be filled with guilt.
You could get him out and then divorce him.
Not an option. I'm catholic. Hence the guilt.
So, what are our options?
This; our stolen moments;
seeing each other whenever we can: Carlos never needs to know.
No.
I thought this is what you wanted.
I want all of you.
All or nothing.
Then it's nothing.
So you won't get a divorce, but you'll have an affair.
I said I was catholic, not a fanatic.
You know, David, you could tell me to stop.
Just tell me to stop, and I will.
Or you can have me right now  on my terms.
All right.
What are you doing?
Making my point:
You don't love me!
Yes. I do.
No! You just agreed to an affair.
A cheap illicit affair with the woman you love?
Carlos would never share me!
He's looking at 8 years in prison
because the mere thought of it sent him into a violent rage.
That is love!
This is just lust, mixed with post-traumatic stress.
I will see you in court tomorrow 10 a. m..
And don't be late.
Or else, I'll have you disbarred for sexual harassment.
I'd take it easy with that snail poison. It's hell on your agapanthus.
Thanks, I'll keep that in mind.
Is that why you stopped by, for a few gardening tips?
Nobody wants you here, Paul.
Especially me.
I'm just a father looking for his son.
Oh, I know what you are.
First your girlfriend tries to run me off,
with some crazy story about sending Zach to Utah.
Now you're here trying to scare me away.
So much for "love thy neighbor".
Anyway, thanks for the advice.
About my agapanthus, I mean. I'll make sure I'll send you some.
What did Susan tell you?
You are beautiful!
You should really consider wearing this when you marry Mike.
We can make it a family tradition.
Why don't we both stop getting divorced? That would be a nice family tradition.
Hey!
I need to ask you something important.
My God!
Oh! This is it!
Let me get my camera!
No, Mom! Stop!
What is it?
Did you give Zach money to go to Utah?
What?
Yes or no?
He was talking so much about Julie.
I tried to get him to come home with me, I mean, to you -
but he just kept going on and on about her, and I got scared.
Yes or no?
Yes.
Mike!
Mike, I didn't do it to hurt you! You got to believe me!
I should've told you rightaway, I know that.
But you know now, so can we please talk about it?
No.
Wait, stop!
Susan -
You said you wanted to help me, and I believed you.
That's it. We're done.
No!
No, no!
I screwed up, OK.
I want to fix it! Please let me fix it. Talk me out of it.
I love you.
Please, no! Please!
Come back!
Yes, every little girl dreams of a big white wedding.
But some dreams just don't come true.
Previously on Desperate Housewives:
You're glowing today, you know that?
Gabrielle got pregnant.
You walked out on me.
Yeah. But look how far I got.
I'm just up the street.
Trouble moved in.
Being with George made you feel a bit guilty.
Well, I just have to get over it, won't I?
And Bree moved on.
"I know who really killed Melanie Foster. You arrested the wrong man"?
But not everyone...
Call 911 and tell them you got the killer locked up in the basement!
He is not a killer.
...got what they deserved.
It is often said that Necessity is the mother of Invention.
This is how mothers came to invent play dates,
so occasionally they could have a little time for themselves.
If you need me, I'll be at the salon.
But there are some mothers who don't get to take advantage of this maternal innovation.
Mothers like -
Lynette Scavo,
who was no longer able to rest on weekends
because her twins no longer received play date invitations
ever since they had convinced Sasha Eden's boy
that a pair of magic wings would allow him to fly;
and they had double-dared Sharon Chasen's boy to ride his bike
blindfolded;
and they had encouraged Lisa Seedman's boy to try an exciting new game called
"Toss The Brick".
The Scavo twins had become personae non gratae,
and Lynette's secret dream of being able to take an occasional nap on Saturdays
was growing dimmer and dimmer.
Until one day -
Hey, hey! Porter, Preston, knock it off!
Did you hear me? I said, stop it!
Stand up!
Come here!
I'm so sorry. Did my son beat you up?
No, we were beating them up.
Is that true? Did they beat you up?
Nah, it didn't hurt that much.
Jimmy? PJ? What are you doing?
What have I told you about ganging up on people?
I am so sorry.
I don't  it's OK.
Believe me, my boys can take care of themselves.
If they got hurt at all, I'll pay for the doctor bills.
No, don't worry.
I got the feeling they were sort of enjoying themselves.
Really?
What would you say to bringing your boys over to my house
and letting them hang out with mine some time?
And that's how Lynette finally got what she needed:
time for herself.
And play dates for her kids.
I'm sorry, but
my boys decided to have a rock fight with your boys.
It was fun!
Play dates she was determined to keep...
Well -
They look fine to me.
...at all costs.
Same time next week?
OK.
season 2 episode 7
Color and Light aka I Must Be Dreaming
Cameras are simple tools designed to capture images.
Images that tell us more about ourselves than we realize.
They remind us of the long journey we've taken;
the loved ones who travelled alongside us;
those we lost along the way -
and those waiting for us on the road ahead.
OK -
How am I supposed to eat with a uterus staring me in the face?
Oh Gabby, I didn't know you got a sonogram. Let me see it.
Honey, you need to put that in a frame or something.
I don't think so.
Oh come on, that's a picture of your baby!
You can't tell me you're not a little bit excited.
Fine.
"I'm pregnant! Weee!"
Now, come on.
We're supposed to be cheering up Susan.
This is a time of crisis,
and I think you need another scoop of mint-chocolate chip.
Thanks.
Susan, why are you so eerily calm?
Mike Delfino just dumped you.
The Susan Meyer I know would be a blubbering mess right now.
Come on, thrush her on out. She's fun to watch.
Actually, I think I'm starting to feel pretty Zen about the whole thing.
I think Mike will calm down in a couple of days and come to his senses.
No.
I came between the man and his son.
That was a huge betrayal.
I can't even blame him for hating me.
But Zach was starting to obsess with Julie again.
Exactly.
You're a mother trying to protect her child. It's a natural impulse.
Over the past couple of days, I gave myself a long hard look in the mirror,
and I did not like what I saw.
I'm with you.
Carry on.
I just think if I start acting like an adult for once,
maybe somewhere down the line, Mike and I at least can be friends.
All right, you're not Zen.
You're numb.
I'm fine!
D'you got any pie?
Not unless we make some.
I can wait.
So if you need us, we'll be at home, having a quiet evening.
Funny, we're expecting quite the opposite.
Well, don't forget, next week it's our turn.
We'll be taking Porter and...
Preston.
... Preston off your hands all weekend.
Rest assured, we have not forgotten it.
See ya!
Bye!
Don't worry!
Whoa, guys!
Why aren't you upstairs with PJ and Jimmy?
They're watching this dumb video they brought.
It's boring.
Well, you should be polite and watch it too. They're your guests.
Guys!
Hey guys! We got snacks!
I'll just reconnect the works. Good to go?
OK, ready?
OK.
Hang on now, just a moment. I'm just getting up.
Guys, what is this?
A movie.
Mommy and Daddy made it.
Peek, peekaboo...
Wow, what's under there?
Peekaboo...
Peekaboo!
Oh my God! Where's the off button?
It's underneath the panel thing!
It's stuck! Get the remote!
Peekaboo!
What's wrong?
I found it!
So can we have the cocoa now?
Well, what do you think?
It is glorious. I have to have it.
How much do you deserve Dolce & Gabbana?
Verne...
You never call. You never write.
I know I haven't been in the store lately.
But I've been a little busy, getting my husband out of jail.
That's such a white trash thing to say.
Luckily the judge dropped the hate crime charge.
Now all Carlos has to do is serve out the slave labor thing.
He'll be out in six months.
If he's still in the hoosegow, why do you need a fancy party dress?
Because some of my model friends are coming down from New York on Friday.
So I have to look better than ever.
I can't have them thinking that I moved to this suburb and I shop at strip malls.
When they see this dress, they will crumple to the floor like the botoxed hags they are.
Good.
You know, it's a little snug.
Yeah, I see that.
I have the same thing in a 0, why not go up a size?
Because I wear 00, you twerp!
Why are you getting snappy?
Because you just called me fat!
Honey, you're pregnant. Your body's changing.
But I'm only 3 months pregnant! Women don't show at 3 months.
Is that what women do?
Do you want the larger size or not?
I'm just not going to eat for 2 days.
OK, you totally deserve to wear Dolce & Gabbana.
I want an explanation from you! Do you hear me?
Edie, you just better get the hell off my back!
Oh, what are you going to do? I'd like to hear this! Big man! Big dreck!
Back off! Back the hell off!
Hi.
OK, so I got the boxes that you left on my porch.
Yeah, I figured you'd want your stuff back.
Thanks, that's great.
'Cause if you'd decided to hang on to my Joni Mitchell CDs, I'd have had to come after you with a club.
OK, it's not funny.
Actually, I wanted to see if you were aware that you gave me back the Valentine's Day card.
I was aware, yeah.
Oh. Well -
When two people split up, normally they don't give things back like Valentine's Day cards.
If you don't want it, you can throw it away.
Just please don't give it back to me. It's tacky.
I'm sorry.
That's OK, people make...
mistakes.
Anything else?
Look.
Are you sure this is what you want to do?
I understand that you don't want our relationship to continue. You have made that clear.
But I sort of thought, down the long corridors of time, maybe you and I could be friends.
And if you keep acting like this -
Susan, it's over. On every level.
I moved on. You should do the same.
Miserable son of a bitch!
I'll say one thing for us:
Even with all our problems, at least we're not acting like that.
OK, I'm starting to get the feeling that we're not going to a yard sale.
That was just a clever ruse to get you into my car.
Are you ready for your surprise?
Oh!
George, this is just an empty house. Why is this a surprise?
I just bought it.
Oh my God! Congratulations!
Oh George, I didn't even know you were looking!
Hurry, Ceal, they're here!
I'm coming!
Hey, Georgie!
Bree, I'd like you to meet my mother.
George never introduces me to anyone.
So I knew you were special.
And this is Ceal, my mother's friend and the real estate agent who sold me the house.
Hi!
Hi.
Well, we're going to go in the back, so George can  you know.
So?
You really like it?
I do. I really do.
Good, 'cause I was sort of hoping that you might like to live here.
Bree -
will you marry me?
Huh?
I love you. And I think I know how you feel about me.
So why wait?
George, Rex hasn't even been dead for two months!
Yes, but if his death has taught us anything, it's that life is short.
It's dumb to play it safe.
If we see a chance for happiness, we should grab it and hold on tight.
See, I thought we were going to a yard sale.
Please.
Just say the word, and you'll make me the happiest guy on earth.
Congratulations, you two!
Mazzel tov!
Guys, wait. She hasn't said yes yet.
Oh.
I told you we should wait.
So  Bree -
What do you say?
See, George.
The thing is -
OK.
You will?
You'll marry me?
OK.
Oh, my baby!
Who is it?
Your ex-husband.
Karl -
What do you want?
Uh, Edie and I just broke up.
Oh.
Come on in.
Sorry to come over at such short notice, but I couldn't face going to a motel.
That's OK.
Julie's staying at her friend's tonight. You can sleep in her room.
On the sofa is fine, but thanks.
So am I allowed to ask what happened?
You could ask, but I won't tell.
Why not?
'Cause it's embarrassing.
Karl, did you cheat again?
No.
Did she cheat?
No.
You finally saw her without her makeup.
Susan!
I'm sorry.
Are you OK?
Yeah.
Haven't been working for quite a while. This was inevitable.
Well, these days anybody going through a breakup gets my sympathy.
That's right, I heard you made the plumber angry?
No, I made the plumber furious.
That is definitely over.
So there will be no gloating from me.
Here's to no gloating.
Actually, I'm trying to keep a positive outlook on the whole thing.
Last night, I started writing, and -
well, I think there's a book in there.
A book?
Yeah.
Like one of your children's books?
No, this one's for adults.
About all my failed relationships.
You're not writing about me, are you?
You're like the first 14 chapters.
Are you going to be fair?
I'm going to be honest.
I was afraid of that.
It was just awful.
George had a ring. His mother and her friend were there with champagne.
If I had said no, it would have devastated him.
So you agreed to marry him just to be polite?
Well, obviously there is a downside to having good manners.
So, when will you tell him how you really feel?
That's why I wanted to talk to you.
Part of me keeps thinking, maybe I should just do it.
Do it? You mean actually marry him?
I know it sounds rash, but -
well, there's something comforting about George.
We share the same tastes and interests.
Oh, and best of all: he loves the opera.
The opera?
Yes, we saw Aida last week, and we both cried buckets.
It was fun.
George loves art, poetry and music...
It would be nice to be married to someone who looks for beauty in the world, like I do.
I don't know.
That's why I'm here. I don't know what to do, Dr Goldfine.
Bree, you've said many times how comfortable you are with George.
But you don't feel for him the way you felt for Rex.
No.
True love is great.
But at this point in my life -
I think I'd rather just go to the opera.
Give me your glass.
Oh, no, wait.
Got to finish off this -
No, wait.
Four glasses is my limit.
If you help me finish off this bottle, I'll tell you what happened between me and Edie.
Hit me.
Edie was making the bed
and found a picture I kept under the matress.
A picture I didn't want her to see.
What was it?
It was a picture of you.
Why would you -?
Because it's something I like to take a look at, every now and then.
Wow!
What the hell was that?
That was something I've been wanting to do for quite some time.
Oh, that's just you rebounding from Edie.
So you're on the rebound from the plumber. No harm, no foul.
Karl. Don't be so weird.
Two old friends suddenly find themselves single.
There's nothing weird about us helping each other out to be -
a little less lonely.
Thanks so much for taking care of the boys.
I'll be back on Friday to pick your guys up.
Leonard and I are going to take them out to the water park.
Yeah, um, before that happens -
I would we'd be able to take Penny sweet out! She's gotten sooo big!
Peekaboo!
OK, enough of that!
Is there something wrong?
Actually, yes.
We've agonized whether to tell you this, Norma, but -
One of your private videos made its way into Jimmy and PJ's bag.
Please tell me the kids didn't see it.
Oh no, don't worry. I caught it.
Right before you took off your bra.
I have to go.
Norma, we just thought you needed to know what happened.
Seriously, we're cool with this, as long as you keep it away from the kids -
I told Leonard this was going to happen!
Jimmy! PJ! Close the door! Hurry up!
Norma, wait!
We're scheduled for next week!
Norma!
The water park! Right?
Mum!
Mum?
Mum, are you up?
Oh my God.
Oh, Julie!
I thought you were going straight to school.
I  I needed money for lunch.
There's a 20 in my pants.
If you can find them.
Julie -
Honey -
OK. There is a good explanation for what happened.
I doubt that.
You probably don't know that your father and Edie broke up last night.
You slept with him the same night he broke up with her.
I said it was a good explanation, not a great one.
Julie -
Hey pumpkin.
Don't even finish.
I feel really awful.
Me too.
We should not have done what we did.
I know, I know.
But I gotta tell you -
Last night was the best sex ever.
Was it though? You were fantastic.
Yeah, I'm just trying to keep up with you.
Why do you think we got so good all of a sudden?
Because we've been angry at each other for so long.
We finally found the way to channel it.
Maybe.
So what happens next?
Well, I'm going to take a shower.
No, I mean with us.
Us? What do you mean? There is no us.
You can't tell me you can just walk away from this chemistry we got going.
I mean, what happened last night was -
explosive!
Karl!
Last night was two old friends helping each other through a rough patch. That's it.
Suzie-cue.
Karl -
I want to move on. I don't want to go backwards. I'm sorry.
But thank you for the explosion. I really needed it.
After 48 hours of crash dieting, Gabrielle prepared to savor the fruit of her labor.
But she was dismayed to discover that she herself had ripened considerably.
Ralph!
I need help getting dressed! Get in here!
Now!
I have to fit in this, so for God's sakes, put some muscle into it!
I'm trying.
It won't zip.
Well try harder!
God, how my hands hurt.
I'm sorry, Ms Sols, but I can't get you into this dress. It's just too small.
Get me into this dress, and I will pay you $10 more a week!
I think I got it, hold on!
Hold still!
Here we go!
One -
two -
three!
Thank God.
We brought you some ice cream.
I know how long it's been since you had any.
We'll have that in a minute, sweetheart.
First, I want you to talk to me about what happened.
About Melanie.
I don't want to talk about her.
You know it breaks my heart to keep you down here like this.
But I can't let you out,
until I am positive that you will never hurt anyone else again.
And the first step is for you to show me
that you understand that what you did was wrong.
She was a bad person.
She deserved it.
No one deserves to die like that, Caleb.
Don't you agree?
Very well.
If that's how it's going to be -
this is how it's going to be.
I can't believe we're doing this.
If Leonard and Norma want to cut ties with us, who are we to stop them?
They need to know we don't judge them for what they do in the privacy of their own home.
And, well, it's not unheard of to tape yourself while you're having sex.
Obviously, they were so embarrassed they don't want anything to do with us.
Maybe we need to respect that.
I need these play dates.
Tom, we need these play dates.
Right, fine. But you do all the talking.
OK.
Norma -
Wait!
Let's go.
No!
Hey, Scavos! What are you guys doing here?
Hi. Sorry for just showing up unannounced, but -
could we talk to you for a minute?
Sure, come on in.
So, um -
we've been trying to contact you, but you weren't returning any of our messages.
And we really hope it isn't because of the porno video.
Home  movies.
The fact is, we really don't care.
And it's certainly no reason to keep our boys apart.
We just don't know how they found it.
But you know boys, they get into everything.
But seriously, it's not a big deal.
I mean, as long as you make sure it never happens again.
It's the new millennium.
We're hip.
What we're saying is, we get it.
You're just having fun. It's nothing to be ashamed of.
I'm just so relieved this all worked out.
At one point, we actually talked about selling the house and moving.
Oh, no!
Thank you for being so open-minded.
Please. We're all adults. It's -
I gotta tell you, the most embarrassing part of that video is how poorly it was shot.
The production values are caca.
Well, from a lay perspective, it looked very professional.
What you saw was an example of my earlier work.
Since then, I've become much more adept at -
production.
You know, editing and lighting.
Leonard has always dreamed of directing movies.
Ironic, isn't it? I finally get my wish, and no one gets to see my work.
That is a damn shame.
I don't know, what do you think?
Should we show them the room?
Let's show them the room, huh?
Check out this baby.
3 chip high depth. 1280 by 700 lines of resolution.
Balanced lighting and dark sheets, so you don't get a kick off the pillows.
Took me a while to learn that little trick.
These walls are completely soundproof.
You could scream your lungs out in here, and nobody'd hear you.
It's true.
So -
Anytime you want to set up a shoot, just let me know.
You guys would love it.
Once you get in front of that camera, you feel like a star.
Good night.
Good night!
I'm taking no more play dates.
Not a one.
Hey.
We'd better hurry. The movie starts in 20 minutes.
There's been a slight change of plans.
My mother had a couple of friends who really wanted to meet you,
and I thought, what the heck, could be fun. Do you mind?
No, I guess not.
Hey everybody, this is Bree.
And this is my uncle Sid -
Hi.
Hi.
Rosalee -
Hello.
Oh, and this is Stan Grazi. He does my mum's taxes.
She's a knockout, George!
I guess I owe you an apology.
Since I was single all these years, Stan kept telling my mum I was gay.
I'm still going to need some proof.
I guess I'll be getting that in about 9 months, hey, Bree?
What  what happens in 9 months?
It's just Stan's little joke about when we're going to start our own family.
No, just so you know, Stan, it's going to be a while before we even think about kids.
I want Bree all by myself for a while.
Well, I wouldn't wait too long. After 40, the eggs don't get any fresher.
Am I right, Bree?
If you'll excuse me, I -
I have to go.
Bree!
Bree, where are you going?
Taking my champagne and my aging eggs, and I'm going home!
What's wrong?
George, I'm starting to think that we made a mistake rushing into this engagement.
What?
And I'm not the only one who thinks that. Other people have said the same thing.
What others? Andrew?
No. Dr Goldfine, my therapist.
Your therapist? He doesn't know me.
He knows me. And certainly better than you do.
How can you say that?
Well, for starters, he knows the last thing I'd ever want to do is have more children.
Really?
Well, I didn't know.
But you should know that.
That's the kind of thing that people who are engaged are supposed to know about each other.
It doesn't matter. I don't need children.
It's not just that, George.
Dr Goldfine has other concerns about us being together, and I'm starting to think he's right.
Look -
I'll agree with Dr Goldfine on one thing.
We should slow things down.
Really?
Yes.
Just because 2 people are engaged, doesn't mean they have to get married any time soon.
I'll talk to Dr Goldfine about it tomorrow.
Take whatever time you need.
How many times am I going to have to ask you to fix this step?
Matthew?
You didn't answer me.
Did you leave the door open?
How do you do?
Not good. People are going to start coming home from work soon.
OK. We can't panic.
Caleb is scared.
He doesn't know the area.
So he's going to be close by.
Which yards haven't you checked yet?
Bree! I desperately need your help.
Dear, what's wrong?
How do you get your hydrangeas to look so stunning?
I'm systematically slaughtering my own garden.
Do you really want to know my secret?
Yes!
Horse manure. I have it delivered.
Susan makes fun of me. But the proof is in the pudding.
Hello.
Hey.
Looking for something?
Uh -
Yeah, actually  I'm looking for you.
Me?
You're looking for me?
Yeah.
I've been thinking about you.
That time we met I thought you were really cool.
So you came to ask me out?
'Cause I'll say yes.
Thank you.
Anything?
That was a waste of time.
Pretty much.
Did you hear the big news?
Uh, the big news?
Karl and I are back together.
What?
And I know that he stayed at your place last night.
Which leads me to why I'm here.
There's some stuff that I have to say, and it's not going to be pleasant.
Edie, uh -
Whatever it was you said to him -
really helped.
He showed up with flowers, and he apologized for everything.
So -
Thank you.
I'm sorry, what?
Well, I'm not going to say it again. It hurt my teeth the first time.
No, Edie -
This is so unexpected on so many levels. I don't know what to say.
Then say nothing.
Oh, and here -
is the photo of you I found in our bed.
I know he told you about it.
Why are you giving it to me?
Look, I appreciate whatever it was that you did last night.
But it's still important for you to understand that -
I won.
You won?
Yeah. Whatever little hold you had on Karl, is officially over.
So you can stop feeling all smug and superiour that he kept that thing.
Believe me, I don't feel superior.
Good. 'Cause you shouldn't.
He made his choice. And it's not you.
You're right.
He made his choice.
Bree, it's still too easy to breathe, you gotta make it tighter!
Gabby, if I make it any tighter, you won't be able to sit down.
I don't care! Can't have any of these girls thinking that I'm pregnant.
Do you actually think they're going to make fun of you?
Trust me, they're merciless.
But why? I mean, surely they have friends who have children.
When I decided to marry Carlos, I told these girls
I would spend the rest of my days being rich and in love and childless.
And they laughed at me,
and they said I would just end up being another fat hausfrau,
living a life that I didn't plan.
I'm not going to give them the satisfaction of knowing they were right.
Well, maybe they'll just be happy for you.
Bree, my friends are models. They're never happy for anyone.
Do you ever think you might like it?
What?
Motherhood.
No.
Come on. You don't think you're going to love your own baby?
I'm not saying that I'm not going to grow attached to the little bugger,
I just don't have the motherhood gene.
I wish I did, but I don't.
What?
I'm just smiling because,
I think a few months from now you're going to come to me
and tell me how madly in love you are with your new little baby,
and I'm going to have to resist the urge to say, "I told you so".
Maybe. But I doubt it.
There you go! All done.
How do I look?
Positively glowing!
Bree.
I'll get the champagne.
Hi! Helloo!
Oh my God!
You're pregnant!
Bree? It's Gabby!
Honey, it's open. Come on in.
Hi.
My  friends just left,
and I was hoping you could come over and cut me out of this thing.
How was your little reunion?
It was, um -
weird.
Weird?
Well, Allison's mad because she's losing jobs for 14-year-olds,
Holly is on a strict diet of cruciferous vegetables,
and Yazmin is undergoing a new embryonic facial treatment
that probably causes short-term-memory loss.
I just stood there the whole night, trying to remember why we were ever friends.
And I couldn't -
You know, honey -
People change.
Yeah, but that's the thing: they haven't changed.
That's who they've always been.
I have changed.
And I honestly don't know how.
Well -
Maybe Susan, Lynette and I have had a good influence on you.
I doubt that.
Come on.
When I finish up here, I'll come over with my sewing kit and cut you out of that.
All right.
But hurry up, because I've been having to pee since the hors d'uvres.
Are you free to go shopping tomorrow?
I figured it's probably time I bought some clothes that actually fit.
Well, I know a store that carries maternity clothes with designer labels.
I like the sound of that.
Thanks.
Thank you.
Yes, cameras are tools designed to capture images.
Wait.
She needs me to get something for her. I will be right back.
But in truth, they can capture so much more.
They can uncover hidden longing
of men who should no longer care.
They can reveal the extraordinary secrets
of the most ordinary marriages.
Most amazing of all,
cameras can quietly and clearly reveal to us our dreams.
Dreams we didn't even know we had.
Previously on Desperate Housewives:
I'm going to be a stay-at-home dad.
Some reversed rolls.
I've been thinking about you.
So you came to ask me out?
Some were welcomed in.
'Cause I'll say yes.
I moved on. You should do the same.
Some were shown the door.
Will you marry me?
And some
never got the chance
to find out what they really wanted.
Betty Applewhite was a gifted woman.
Everyone had always said so,
ever since she was a child.
Her first piano teacher praised her dexterity.
Her first college professor applauded
her sense of rhythm.
Her first symphony conductor hailed
her dramatic flair.
But Betty was no longer a concert pianist.
She was now just a woman with a secret..
one she was determined to keep
by any means necessary.
I'm not a bit surprised that somebody
broke into Gabrielle's house.
Wisteria Lane is an easy target. It's not
like the police patrol around here.
We still have the neighborhood watch.
The neighborhood watch is a joke.
When was the last time any of you
went on patrol, huh?
I put security lights on my house.
I say, it's time that we hire professional security.
That sounds expensive.
Could you really put a price on your kids' safety?
Well, you probably could.
Look, McClusky, I am as worried
as everybody else in this neighborhood,
but I don't know if guys running around with weapons...
We've got to stop this.
And say what, "we're against security"?
But if they find Caleb first...
Matthew, I'm trying to think.
I'm not talking about a bunch of vigilantes.
I'm talking about trained men
who know when to shoot.
Do we really need professional security?
Are you all going to wait until
somebody else is attacked?
I think it's time to take a vote on armed security.
I'm not scared for now.
I've had enough. All those in favor...
Sorry.
Things were just going so  dramatic.
Wow, you're really good!
We were taking a vote here.
She was a concert pianist.
Well, I doubled a bit.
Yes, Betty Applewhite was a gifted woman.
And the greatest of all her gifts
was her timing.
Season 2 episode 8:
The Sun won't Set
Once they've suffered a miscarriage,
some women sit alone in the dark for hours.
They refuse to go out in the light of day,
afraid to face the possibility that life will go on.
They hold on to reminders of their unborn child
and dream of what might have been.
Yes, this is how some women react
when they've suffered such a loss.
Gabrielle Solis was not one of those women.
Hi guys!
Hi honey! How are you?
I'm fine.
Thank you for the messages. I'm sorry
I haven't had the time to return calls.
We all clutter our schedules.
We thought maybe you could use some company?
So we are going to go to my house,
I made banana bread,
and we'll put on a fresh pot and
just talk about anything.
That.. sounds so nice..
It's just, I'm booked solid today.
My head's going to explode.
Can I take a rain check?
Sure.
Thanks.
Thanks for understanding.
Ok, I will call you tonight, and we'll
figure out a time later in the week.
Tell you what, since it's my schedule
that seems to be the problem..
why don't I just figure out a time and call you?
Ok.
I have so many errands to run,
and a million things to return...
Oh honey, there's no reason why you
and Carlos can't try again.
You'd be an amazing mother.
You should hold onto that stuff for a while.
I would, but the store has this
strict 30-day return policy.
Carlos, what happened?
I've had a rough couple of days.
After you told me about the...
the baby.
I kind of lost it.
God, what's with your hands?
I ripped my mattress open.
Jeez! How are you feeling today?
They've injected me with this tranquilizer thing.
I think it's doing the trick.
We haven't even talked abot names.
I had my top five all picked out.
Honey...
You want to hear?
No, I'm good.
You never thought about names?
No. It was a little soon for that,
don't you think?
How can you name something
the size of a walnut?
Is this new?
Do you like it?
I picked it up on the way here.
You just lost a baby!
We all grieve differently.
You're sort of taking it pretty well.
I go shopping, you rip toilets out of the wall.
Different strokes.
Are you even sad?
Oh please. What do you think?
Honestly, I don't know!
Of course I'm sad, it's a sad situation.
Now let go of me!
Hole me up.
Are you ok?
I think my tranquilizer's wearing off.
Well, let's get you another round!
Hey Mike.
So my mom's wedding's in a couple of days,
and I know you sent back those little cards
saying that you're coming,
and that you preferred beef
Anyways, I know that was before
we.. you know.
Send your mom my apologies,
but I won't be attending.
I hope that's not just because of us
not being us anymore.
I mean, we could be together at the wedding,
and it wouldn't have to be weird.
It'd be weird.
'Course. Yeah, I see that.
So what've you been doing lately?
As usual.
Well, I've been writing a book.
Sort of autobiographical.
It's been forcing me to reexamine some
of the different things that have made me me,
like the fact my mother had me so young,
and I never knew my dad...
big stuff like that.
I told you about my dad, right?
He was a Merchant Marine, and his platoon
was killed in the battle of Hanoi.
That's strange.
Why?
Well, Hanoi was on enemy territory.
There wasn't a battle there.
Are you sure? That's what my mom said.
I'm pretty sure, yeah.
And Merchant Marines don't fight,
they deliver supplies and ships.
Oh.
Well, clearly I have more research to do.
So what do you think?
My life's story  would you rush out
and buy a copy?
Susan -
Yeah?
You're going to need to step back.
Catch catch catch!
I want to be quarterback! Go off for a catch!
Porter, Preston, what have I told you
about playing outside after dark?
It's not dark.
Does your Dad know you're out here?
Don't worry, I've been watching them.
They keep setting off my motion sensors.
I ought to send you half my electric bill.
You do that!
ok, guys, come on over here. On the sidewalk.
Stay there. Not on the street. Thank you.
Hey.
Hey babe.
I'm home.
Could you come here a sec?
Sure, what's up?
Block me, come on!
Damn, they must have snuck out again!
Again? How often does this happen?
Boys! Get in here, now!
Honey, you know how slippery they are.
It's like trying to herd cats.
Tom, it's 9 o'clock at night!
Guys, upstairs, now! Let's go!
In the PJs, in the bed!
Honey, they're fine. You just worry too much.
And for good reason!
Someone could've driven off with them,
and you wouldn't have even noticed.
They were in the front yard!
God, when I was their age, I used to hop
on my bike, disappear for hours.
My mom never batted an eye.
That was a different time.
You have to be more vigilant.
There was a break-in on this street.
I was at the neigborhood watch meeting, remember?
I'm sorry, I've been doing this for 7 years.
Trust me, you have to have eyes
in the back of your head.
The two in front work just fine, thanks.
Really?
M-hm.
Where's Penny?
See?
Right where I left her.
How did this get in the paper?
I was going to call you.
We discussed this. We agreed to go slowly.
I was going to call and cancel after our talk,
but things just got so hectic. I forgot.
Rex has only been dead for 7 weeks!
So?
So I don't want every woman in this town
talking about me behind my back!
I'm sorry.
But isn't the damage done?
Well, fortunately people only read the
announcements when there's nothing on the front page,
and the headline today was about
some catastrophic flood in Sri Lanka.
Oh, so we lucked out!
Yes, we did.
Now, when the time comes to go
public with our relationship,
I need you to discuss it with me first.
I'm the bride after all. It's only appropriate.
ok.
I will need you to wear that ring now.
The ring?
You're not wearing it. Where is it?
It's in my purse.
Good.
Please put it on.
But if people see it -
They'll assume that you're wearing
your wedding ring.
Maybe, but why risk it?
Because a ring tells would-be suitors
a woman is spoken for.
A naked hand invites unwanted attention.
Here, let me.
Will that be all, Mrs Van De Kamp?
Yes, I think so, Mr Williams.
Oh my God!
What do you want?
Eh  it's cool!
No, it's not cool! Who the hell are you?
Carlos sent me.
I'm going to call the police!
My name's Hector. I met Carlos inside.
Inside what?
You mean, in prison?
He told me what happened and asked me
to come by and keep an eye on you.
Can I come in?
No! No, you can't come in!
I brought a cooler, I'll camp out here.
No! I can take care of myself, ok?
Ok.
Ok?
Yeah, I get it. You need your space.
Yes.
Yes I do, I need my space. Thank you.
I want to show you something. Come here.
Hi guys!
I thought about what you said, don't want you to worry,
so I had a little talk with the boys.
Ok. Guys, what do we do...
if a stranger asks us to take a ride in their car?
Porter.
We run away and call 911.
Good man! Right.
But what if that stranger says,
"Hey, I know your Mommy and Daddy"?
What? Preston!
Still run away!
Yes! ok..
Can I ask a question?
Yeah, by all means.
What if the stranger is nice and not scary?
Yes?
Run away and call 911.
So what if the stranger says they're going to take you...
to the circus? For pizza and elephant rides?
Don't look at your Dad! Eyes on me!
What are you going to do?
We...
...run away?
Yes!
Snap! To the kitchen! We are having ice cream tonight!
Yeah!
You get the bowls!
You're smiling like that actually
meant something.
Lynette, come on. We worked on this
all afternoon. They get it.
Give me a break. You know our kids.
I love them dearly, but that goes
in one ear and out the other.
I can't reach it!
I'm going to have some ice cream.
Tom, you're not off the hook here!
Lynette, I can keep my children alive.
When you left this morning, there were four.
When you came home, there were still four.
When you come home and there are
only three, then you get to lecture me.
Excuse me!
Are you Bree Van De Kamp?
Yes, I am.
My name is Leila Mitzman.
I hope I'm not interrupting?
Can I help you?
This may sound odd, but I felt
I should see you.
I read in the paper that you're engaged
to George Williams.
Oh, well, that announcement was a bit premature.
But you and George are involved?
In a romantic relationship?
Yes.
Then we need to talk.
We'd been dating for 6 months
when he asked to marry him.
From the moment I said yes,
George got so possessive.
And when he found out my ex
lived just down the street,
George accused me of seeing him behind his back.
And then one night, I got a call
from the police.
Someone had set my ex's car on fire.
I could never prove anything,
but I knew it was George.
I left him the next day.
Well. I don't know what to say.
I know it's upsetting.
Yes, it is.
To have a complete stranger come
into my home, drink my tea
and then try to turn me against one
of the sweetest men I have ever known.
Honey, you got to trust me.
George is a wack job, and you
should get while the getting's good.
I think it's time for you to leave.
One time, I was talking to a guy at the bar,
and when we got home, George slapped me.
What do you say to that?
I say, given your overall demeanor
and your free-wheeling used-up epithets,
I'm willing to bet that he was provoked.
When I read you were engaged to George,
I felt it was my duty to let you know he's crazy.
But now that I've met you, I can see
it's a match made in heaven!
I'm here!
Hi, Morty. Reverend Hopkins.
I'm sorry I'm late to rehearsal.
It's ok, it's all right. You're here now.
It's fine.
Go in front of me.
Ok, Reverend! Hit it!
Mom, can I ask you a question?
You've got to march, Suzie! Got to march!
I was just researching my book,
and I found the strangest thing:
No one with my father's name
was ever a Merchant Marine.
Did I say Merchant? I just meant
the regular Marines.
I thought you probably did, so
I checked that too. And he wasn't there.
So I called the VA
and there is not a single record of
anyone named Harrison Ross in Viet Nam.
This is not the time, Suzie.
What's the hold-up with you?
I'm sorry to upset you, Mom, just..
don't you think that's weird?
What's weird?
There's no record of anyone with
my Dad's name in the Armed Services.
Oh. There it is.
There what is?
Morty, just go on back up there!
Look, I'm not going to say that
I knew this would happen, but -
I knew this would happen.
Mom, I need answers.
Do you have to do this now?
You are ruining my wedding rehearsal!
You've been married 4 times.
I think you got it down.
I will not stand here and be attacked!
Mom, don't walk away from me!
What do you want me to say?
You want me to say I'm a bad mother?
Fine!
I'm a bad mother!
Are you happy now?
Mom!
Yes, I know what I'm getting into.
Morty, have you seen my Mom?
Yeah. She seemed pretty upset.
I think she took a cab home.
Do you need a ride?
I need you to tell me the truth about my father.
Hop in.
When I was in Korea, I was stationed
outside of Pusan.
We'd get these passes,
and we'd go into town and have a few beers.
We used to call it R&R, in military lingo.
I know what R&R means. So what does
this have to do with my father?
That's what I'm getting to.
Anyway, there were these -
these young ladies.
Professional ladies, if you know what I mean.
Morty, can we just move this on?
Ok.
Long story short, it's just
I never figured that
my first time with a woman
would be in an alley
behind a Korean noodle stand
with my fatigues down around my ankles.
Ok, again.. what does this have
to do with my father?
We've all done things that we're ashamed of.
We all have secrets.
Your father wasn't a war hero.
And he wasn't in Viet Nam.
But why would my mother tell me that?
Sophie wasn't married to your father.
I'm not sure she even knew his name.
Are you saying that I'm the result
of my mother having a one night stand?
Well, like I said, we've all done things
that we're ashamed of.
George.
Bree! This is a surprise!
I'm sorry to drop by unannounced,
but I just had this disturbing visit
from an old friend of yours, Leila Mitzman.
She shouldn't have contacted you.
Well, she did, and she said some
pretty horrible things about you.
You should know that she's a renowned liar.
That's what I thought, at first.
But then, having had time to think about it,
I can't understand why she'd go
to so much trouble.
I mean, what would her motive be?
She's obsessed with me.
She still wants me. Wasn't that obvious?
No.
The woman is absolutely certifiable.
What's more, I can prove it.
Leila was a customer here.
Even though she's no longer welcome,
we still keep her prescriptions on file.
"Fluoxatine 100 mg, Respiradon 250 mil"..
I'm sorry, what is this?
One is an antidepressant, for mood swings;
one is an antipsychotic, to control hallucinations.
Like I said, she's a very troubled lady.
Well, why did you date her in the first place?
In the beginning, you're blinded of flaws, right?
That's true.
In the beginning.
So?
We're good?
Yeah. Of course we are.
Your mail came.
You said you were leaving.
No, I said I was giving you space.
I did. I was watching you from my car.
Look, the guy who broke in stole ice cream.
I don't think I'm in any danger.
So you can go. I don't need you.
Carlos says you do.
Where are you going?
Shopping. Not that it's any of your business.
You sure like to shop!
Yes, I do.
It's all I've seen you do the past day and a half.
All that shopping, you must be
making up for something.
Excuse me?
You know, Carlos has your number.
He says you're one tough cookie.
So tough you don't know how
to deal with your feelings.
He's a perceptive man.
He thought I was cheating with two gay guys.
You sure you want to go with "perceptive"?
Let's see  it's been, what? a week
since you've lost your baby?
Yeah, so?
So I never heard of shopping out the pain.
Why is everyone on my back about this?
I will deal with my loss my way, OK?
Where are you going?
I -
I just thought I will go out and look some more.
Maybe try the park.
In the middle of the night?
Well, he hasn't really been showing
his face in the daylight, has he?
Or would you rather we just let
Caleb on the loose?
He could be in trouble.
Or hurting another girl.
He didn't hurt Mrs Solis, Matthew.
He was just hungry.
I wasn't talking about Mrs Solis.
But you know that.
So are you still going to be my Matron of Honor?
Of course I am.
I'm not going to pretend like I'm not
still a little freaked out. I am.
But I did a lot of thinking about it
this morning, and I think I understand.
You wanted to protect me,
and you thought I needed a hero.
I had one:
you.
I was so worried it would screw you up.
Well, I am screwed up. But that
wasn't your fault.
...entirely.
Hey, Stu.
You busy?
Nah, just updating my blog.
'Cause I've got an important
assignment for you.
Great! I'm ready to take on more
responsibility around here.
I applaud that.
But what I need is for you to help me
prove a point..
to my husband.
Ah! You want to make him jealous!
Uh, no.
Actually -
I need you to kidnap my children.
Stop hitting me!
Ok, so what am I supposed
to be looking at?
Just wait for it.
I'm Ironman, and I'll make you wack!
Ok. There he comes.
What's going on?
Hey, who're you calling dirty?
I'm just trying to prove a point.
Hi!
Little boys!
Hell, who is that?
It's just Stu from our office.
You guys want to go for a ride?
And is he abducting our kids?
Maybe.
This is crazy.
Why? Are you worried they might kid in?
We can go to the -
carnival! You like carnivals?
We're not allowed to talk to strangers.
Rotten boys.
So why don't you boys get in the car?
Run away.
Run!
Get in the car, and I'll give you some candy!
Yeah, candy!
Why aren't they running away?
Chocolate ball!
Well -
This is not the time to be smug.
Clearly, our sons are idiots.
Ok, ok, jeez, everyone share.
Hi.
Hi!
Oh my God!
Run, kids, run!
Don't you dare!
You pervert! Hold on,
you're not going anywhere!
Anyway, after we wrap this shindig,
I'm whisking my new bride away
on a 4 month cruise around the world.
I would have been happy with
a weekend in Vegas, but -
you know -
Anyway, here she is, my beautiful bride.
I want to thank everyone for coming,
and specially my Morty, who's
helped me be a better person.
And I want to thank
my amazing daughter, Susan,
and tell her how much I appreciate
her love and respect.
'Cause I'm a horrible person.
And she deserves so much better than me.
Honey -
No, no.
Susan needs to know the truth.
Your father
was not a one night stand.
He was 33,
and he was married.
And he was my boss.
When I told him I was pregnant,
he broke it off.
He never spoke to me again,
but gave me
my beautiful, incredible daughter.
And for that I want to thank
Addison Prudey.
Oh my God.
Do you know where he is?
I have no idea.
I swear, if I knew I would tell you.
I know Addison Prudey.
He runs the feed and supply store
at 3rd and Sutherland.
Prudey is a fairly common name,
of course, so...
Is that him?
Yes.
Are you saying that all this time,
my father has been alive
and just right across town,
running the supply and feed store?
Susan -
I can't believe this!
You're not still seeing him, are you?
Something wrong?
You've been so quiet all evening.
No, no, I'm just tired, that's all.
Care to dance? Might pep you up.
I don't think so, but thank you though.
Bree, where is your ring?
Oh, um -
The stone is loose, so I'm going
to take it to the jeweller's.
But don't worry, it's safe.
This isn't about Leila, is it?
No!
Just like I told you, the stone
can pop off at any second.
Well, I don't care. Please put it on.
What?
I want you to wear it.
I'm sorry, but I'm not going to.
Why not?
Because I don't feel like it.
And this is the last time we're going to talk about this, ok?
Excuse me, Ma'am, we don't allow
members of Zeta Beta Kappa in here.
Ty! Ty Grant!
Oh boy!
What are you doing in town?
Visiting my folks.
Oh my goodness!
George, this is Ty Grant. We used
to date in college.
Ty, this is George, um -
he's a good friend of mine.
Hi.
Actually, we're engaged.
Bree, you look fantastic.
You haven't aged a day.
Ty, would you like to dance?
Sure. I'd love to.
Let me take your coat.
I need to cut in.
George!
Would you please sit down?
You're being rude.
Am I in the middle of something?
Well, at least put on the ring.
No!
George, I don't want to!
We are engaged! You have to wear it!
George -
Hey, knock it off, man!
Drop it!
I'm sorry.
I just -
We're engaged.
See, the thing is -
I don't think we are anymore.
Bree.
Please -
You should go.
I'm sorry.
All right.
Right over there, Sir. Management
likes us to keep the nice cars out front.
Afternoon!
New hairdo?
So what if it is?
Looks nice, that's all.
You know, I also got a facial,
and later on, I'm going to get a pedicure
and an eyebrow wax, so there!
That's fine with me.
No, it's not. Because I know
what you're thinking.
Yeah?
You know what? I'm tired of you
judging me.
What is it going to take to get rid
of you?
What's your last name?
Ramos.
Ramos.
Here is $1,000.
I won't tell Carlos you didn't stick around.
It'll be our little secret.
I just got out of prison. I'm not exactly
set up with a bank account.
Can we go to your bank and cash this?
And then you'll leave?
Hey, it's a grand!
Buckle up!
You don't have a  a window thingie.
Nope.
You don't have a door handle either.
Nope.
But I do have a confession to make.
Carlos didn't really send me to protect you.
Go figure, no one else in the park.
We got it all to ourselves.
Perfect.
Why don't you go find us a good spot?
I got to get something out of the trunk.
Hey, where the hell are you going?
You're not going to kill me?
I hadn't planned on it.
Besides,
if I was going to kill you,
I wouldn't use a balloon.
Would take too long.
What am I supposed to think?
You lie about protecting me,
and then you lock me in that heap without
door handles so I can't get out!
Carlos sent me to help you with your grief.
You're kidding, right?
No!
Look, I know a little something about loss.
Can take you to some real dark places.
Specially if you don't face it head on.
Like 17 years in a 6'x10' prison cell.
Dark.
What's this for?
The balloon represents the spirit of the life lost.
By letting it go,
you're acknowledging the pain you feel,
and releasing it at the same time.
That's ridiculous.
Besides, I don't feel what
you think I'm feeling.
Then it should be really easy.
Fine. If I do this, will you go?
Yeah.
Ok.
Should I say something?
If you want to.
Not really, no.
That's cool.
Anytime.
It's stupid.
I didn't even want this baby.
Yeah.
And I would have been a terrible mother.
If you say so.
If it was a boy, I was going
to name it Charlie.
Yeah?
And a girl, Aurora.
Those are nice names.
Thank you.
What is it, boy?
What's going on out here?
Call the police!
You need me zappin' him?
Just call the police!
Is that the guy who broke into your house?
Uh, I don't know, I can't see him.
Yeah, that's him.
In a world filled with darkness,
we all need some kind of light.
Whether it's a great flame
that shows us how to win back
what we've lost,
or a powerful beacon intended
to scare away potential monsters,
2, 4, 6, 8, you are...
or a few glowing bulbs
that reveal to us
the hidden truth of our past.
We all need something to help us
get through the night.
Even if it's just the tiniest glimmer..
of hope.
Previously on "Desperate Housewives"
All this time my father has been right across town
running the feed store?
Susan found her real father
Ed wants to make the final decision
Ed Furarer,lynette Scoval
lynette met her new boss
I've learned my lesson. Ok, when I get out of here
Everything's gotta be different
Carlos promised to change his old ways
Dr. Goldfine has concerns about us being together
and I'm starting to thinking he's right
While Bree discovered George's true colors
George, I don't want to!
We are engaged! You have to wear it!
I don't think we are any more
Anyone who'd ever been to a party of Bree van de kamp's
thought of her as the perfect hostes
Because Bree knew how to take care of her guests
Her dinners will always served properly
Her licer always flow freely
And her anicdoses were always enjoyable
But on this night,the perfect hostess
was about to find herself...
Where's that musiccoming from?
in a very imperfect predicament.
Uh,I'm not sure.
Don't give upon us,baby
we're still worth one more try
um,if you'll excuse mefor just one minute.
I know we putour last one by
just for a rainy evening
george!
I have guests.
What do you thinkyou're doing?
We had a tiff. I upset you.
And now I'm just trying to make things right again.
It was not a tiff
We broke up. It's over.
We can still come through
I am not kidding.
If you do not knock it off,I am gonna call the police.
All right,go ahead.
I really lost my head last night
call the police. If they drag me away,
I'm just gonna comeright back here.
I want you to hearthe whole medley
Come on!
Why don't you all take your seats?
dessert is aboutto be served.
I really lost my headlast night
you've got a right
to...
yes,bree knew how to take care of her guests,
especially those who weren't invited.
Good guys wear white hats,
and bad guys wear black.
This is how children distinguish
between good and evil.
But they soon learn that bad guys
don't always look so bad.
In fact,sometimes
they even seem down right friendly.
That is,until you get to know them
a little bit better.
Hey,fancy seeing you here.
I was just out for a little ride.
Don't lie to me,george.
You've been riding up and down this street
for the last hour.
I don't want to do this,bree,
but you won't return any of my phone calls.
So stalking me is plan "b"?
Bree,I know I messed up.
I know I got some issues to work on,
but I'd be willing to see a therapist
if that's what you want.
I'll do anything,but
how can I show you that I can-
I can change if you don't give me a second chance?
Come on.
You know I'm not a bad person.
I do know that,
but I'm just not sure you're a good one,either.
and we integrated the corporate logo
into the jungle background,
creating not only an ad for the clothing,
but for the company itself.
I don't get it.
What,um,don't you get?
The whole idea just kinda makes my head hurt.
Is it just me?
No,nuh-unh.
You're right. It stinks.
Sorry,guys. Back to the drawing board.
Well,I got tickets to a game.
Nina,you do whatever you have to do
to keep us afloat here.
You got it.
Looks like it's gonna be another late night at the office.
Nice work,everybody.
Thank you.
Could you can the attitude,nina?
I'm sorry. What did you just say?
You're being rude.
And it's totally out of line.
You know how hard we all worked on this.
Yeah,I do.
Nina,I think I speak for everyone here
when I say we are sick and tired of your abuse.
Frankly,you owe us an apology.
Is-is this true?
I mean,I would be mortified
if I thought that I'd hurt any of you.
I mean,If anybody feels like I owe them an apology,
please,speak up.
You? You?
You?
Gee,lynette.
I guess you were mistaken.
All right,let's recap,shall we?
Stinky pitch,workin' late,no apologies.
Guys!
We talked about this.
What happened to standing up for ourselves?
Hot muffins.
Any takers?
No,stu. These people don't deserve muffins.
hello?
hello. My name is mark martinez.
I'm the assistant warden down at fairvew county jail.
Is mrs. Solis available?
Uh,yeah,this is her.
Did somethin' happen with carlos?
At 7:43 this morning,
your husband held two guards at gunpoint
and successfully escaped.
He what?!
I take it you had no prior knowledge
he had planned to do this?
No,of course not.
He's a moron!
We have every reason to believe
your husband may come to find you.
We believe him to be armed...
and very,very horny.
What?
Surprise,baby.
I got paroled early.
It's so good to see you!
What happened?
Well,there's this church group
that helps out catholic prisoners.
And they really,really stepped up for me.
Well,what did they do?
They lobbied the parole board and it worked.
I guess I owe the pope a thank-you note.
Less talking,
more stripping.
prudy's feed store.
Apparently,he owns the place.
How are you gonna do it?
What do you mean?
I mean,how are you gonna tell him you're his daughter?
Oh,I'm not.
Julie,the man abandoned me before I was born.
I don't have a desire to have a relationship with him.
Okay,then I'm really confused
why we're here spying on him.
Well,I just wanna see what he's like
and satisfy my curiosity and
get it out of my system.
Well,here you go.
Now you tell charlie that
addison prudy says drop in some time.
I miss that ugly mug of his around here
I will.
I bet I know what you're here for.
Oh?
You heard about the giveaway.
Well,I got the cowboy hats right here.
Oh,oh,no,that's okay.
You don't have to give me anything,really.
Relax. This is a promotional item.
Didn't cost me a dime.
There you go.
Pretty as a picture.
I have a dad.
He's great!
He gave me a hat.
That biting thing at the end...
Totally blew my mind.
Please tell me you didn't learn that in prison.
Yeah.
Wait. I'm not done with you yet.
Just give me ten minutes,please.
What is wrong with you?
You are totally useless after sex.
I know. I should probably get my thyroid
checked out.
who's sister mary bernard?
those are private. Give me-
she's this nun,okay?
She visited me in prisona couple times.
She's part of the group that got me early release.
Now can I please have them back?
"When you walk with godevery day,
"you learn that truth is understood in the mind
but faith burns in the heart"?
You don't know what it was like in there.
All right? 20 hours a day,8x10 cell.
Just you and your mind.
So pretty much just you.
It forces you to rexamine everything.
I was a very bad person for a very long time,
but now all that is gonna change
because I'm on a new path.
A new path?
I am going to livea virtuous life.
I wanna do right by you,
by my mama
and by my god.
What the hell did they do to you in that prison?
All right,this is my last hand,
and then I gotta go.
Already?
I left a proposalon my desk at work.
I have to go over it tonight,or
you-know-who is gonna have my head.
Nina.
You know,this gainful employment thing
is really starting to cut into our social life.
Well,if one of you would just gree to raise my kids,
I wouldn't need a job. Any takers?
Ha ha.
No,I didn't think so.
Ante up.
Speaking of child abandonment,
when are you gonna tell your father
that he has a bouncing,middle-aged baby girl?
Soon. I don't wanna ambush him.
I'm gonna ease into it.
How do you ease into,"hi. I'm your illegitimate daughter"?
Well,actually,there's a "help wanted" sign
in the window,so I was thinking about
getting a job there.
And you know,he would get to know me,
and I'm sure he would like me and
I would like him,and...
then one day,he'd say,
"you're like the daughterI never had,"
and I'd say,"well,actually,now that you mention it... "
okay,I'll go first.
That is the most idiotic plan I've ever heard of.
Why?
Because it all hinges on him responding
to your personality.
And let's face it,you are an acquired taste.
Edie,I am sure susan's father will like her just fine.
Thank you.
I just hope you don't expecttoo much from this relationship.
I mean,aside from D.N.A.,You might find
that you don't have that much in common.
I know,but I gotta find outif there's something there.
I've always wanted a dad.
I mean,I know not having oneaffected me.
Well,of course it did.
Everyone needsa strong male role model.
No,they don'T.
I grew up without a father,and it didn't affect me one bit.
Edie,how old were you when you lost your virginity?
Point well taken.
Hey.
Look what I foundin ed's fridge.
hey,stu.
and nina!
Hey,lynette,can I see you for a sec?
Sure.
Tsk,tsk,tsk.
Having sex with the support staff-
that's a big no-no.
Ed's been known to fire peoplefor that sort of thing.
lynette,
I know that we've had our little differences.
But at the core,
I believe that we're both good people,
both smart women who are just trying to make it
in this vicious male-dominated jungle-
okay,what do you want?
Do you want a raise?
You want a better office?
My demands are simple.
I want you to be nicer.
What?
No more belittling,
berating,
rude sarcasm.
And in exchange I get your silence?
Yeah. Pretty sweet deal,don't you think?
Um...
I'll see what I can do.
Great. Okay.
And I'm gonna take your parking space.
I kid the nina.
you're up early.
I'm going to mass.
Huh?  Yeah.
But it's not even sunday.
They have mass every day of the week.
Really? When did they start doing that?
that's sister mary bernard.
Did you see where I put my bible?
What? I saw your nun.
So? So she's hot.
She's a hot nun.
you cann'tseriously be jealous.
You mean to tell me that this
miraculous conversion of yours
has nothing to do with the fact
that the woman standing outside is a knockout?
That's what I'm telling you.
Um,who are you hereto see?
I'm lynette scavo
I work here
Who are you?
Pat. It's my first day.
Oh. Well,welcome.
What happened to stu?
You fired stu?
Oh,lynette,hey. Come on in.
I can't believe you would sink so low.
I'm going to ed.
Ed knows. This is stu's employee evaluation file right here.
This thing is full of black marks.
Come on,nina. We both know why you got rid of him.
Well,good luck proving it.
Oh,and on a completely unrelated topic,
there's going to be another round of firings
coming down the pike.
Ed's been after me to trim the fat.
You threatening me?
No,no. Unh-unh.
It's just that it's gonna be my job
to evaluate those who are team players
and those who are not.
Just a little heads up.
Just trying to be nice.
I don't know. You seem kinda overqualified.
Why,'cause I went to college?
No,because you finished high school.
well,I just wanna change my life,and...
ever since I was a little girl,
I've always liked horses and the outdoors,and...
well,I'm just fascinated with...
feed
Well,I suppose we could give you a try.
What?
Something on my nose?
Oh,no. Um,I was just lookingat the color of your eyes.
You were?
Yeah. They're just like mine.
They're-they're nice.
Carol sent you to test me,didn't she?
What? Who's carol?
You go back and tell my wife
if a private detectivecouldn't fool me,
well,you're not gonna either.
I don't know whatyou're talking about.
I just came in to get a little  a cute little thing like you
struts in here,flirts with an old codger like me-
how dumb do you thinkI am?
Hey,look at you. Pretty hair. You got a sexy walk.
You got a tight little ass-
oh,I'm your daughter.
What?
Back in the '60s,you had a brief...
relationship with a young girl,sophia bremmer.
She got pregnantand had a baby,
and that baby was me,
which makes you my father.
Hi.
Mr. Prudy,I'm sorry.
I didn't want to spring on you like this.
Where are you going?
You see,when I found out you were alive
and that we both lived in the same city,
I just wanted to meet you.
Mr. Prudy?
mr. Prudy.
Hello?
hello?
And knock wood,the doctors say I'll keep improving
slowly but surely.
So how are you?
Good,good. I'm seeing friends,
and I just startedco-chairing a charity event
for the junior league,and,um,
and I broke up with george.
Really?
Dr. Goldfine,do you ever really cure people,
I mean,even if they're really crazy?
I'm not a big fan of that word.
People either have mental health or they don'T.
When they do have a problem,
you treat them as if they had any other disease,
and sometimes they get better.
Well,when I broke up with george,
I saw something in his eyes.
It was a kind of malevolence,
and it just didn't seem to me
to be the sort of thing that you could cure.
I don't believe in evil either.
We're all just people.
How can you notbelieve in evil?
A man just threw youoff a bridge for no reason.
Exactly. He didn't know anything about me.
He just rode upon his little blue bike
and tried to hurt me.
Do I think he's wicked? No. He's disturbed.
His problems probably stem from a chemical imbalance.
I believe with enough time and treatment,
I could help him.
Did you say a blue bike?
Black?
Great.
I gotta say,lynette,
I was surprised to get your call.
I didn't even think you'd notice I was fired.
Of course I noticed. You are one of my favorites.
And I thought it was really unfair
how it all went down.
It wasn't that unfair,
I was late all those times
and I broke the copier.
And I stole all those paper clips.
See,I don't think that's why you got fired.
Really?That's what nina said.
Word got out thatyou and nina were...
shagging?
being intimate.
And nina fired youto keep ed from finding out.
You're kidding.
And that wasn't rightof her.
She shouldn't have beenhaving sex with you.
She's upper management.
Technically,it's sexual harassment.
But I was into it. I consented.
Stu,you're A... gofer.
You can't consent to anything.
So I think you should talk to ed about
getting your job back.
Why would he care?
Oh,he'll care.
He doesn't want you suing him for millions of dollars.
Wow!
So would nina get in trouble?
Well,I'm not gonna lie to you.
There is a possibility she'd get A...
slap on the wrist.
So...
you'll think about talking to ed?
Definitely.
The nurse told meyou were waiting out there.
I just wanted to seeif you were okay.
Sorry if I spooked you. I've got a bad heart.
It's genetic,so you mightwanna get that checked.
Oh. Okay.
Look,don't take this wrong,but I need you to clear out.
What? I just got here.
My wife is on her way.
The thing is,if carol finds out
I'e got an adult love childrunning around,
that's gonna be the strawthat breaks the camel's back.
I mean,it's not exactlythe only time I've strayed.
Charming.
But believe me
it was niceto finally get to meet you.
You're a lovely woman.
Hon,you really need to leave now.
It's susan.
My name is susan. And
no,that's not good enough.
Look,I'M...
I'm trying really hard to be nice about this,
but you're backing meinto a corner.
It's not like I want an invitation to thanksgiving.
I just wanna have coffee or lunch now and then.
I can't start up something with you.
It wouldn't be fair to my wife.
Oh,that's funny.
So all the times you were cheating on her,
that was okay,but having lunch with your daughter-
that just crosses the line.
I just want a chanceto get to know you.
Well,I don't want toknow you.
I've already got a family.
Years ago,your mother and icame to an understanding.
I gave her a bunch of money,
and she agreedto keep things quiet.
Well,I wasn't consulted on that little arrangement.
I don't think it's fair to punish me for
a mistake I madeyears ago.
Is that what you think of me?I'm a mistake?
That's what you need to hear,yeah.
That's what I think.
Oh,addy!
Addy! Oh!
Oh,are you okay?
I'm good,baby.
The kidsare on their way over.
Hi. I'M... carol.
You are...
do you wanna tell her,or should I?
I'm your husband'sguardian angel.
Excuse me?
My name's susan.
I was buying some horse feed when
mr. Prudy had an attack behind the counter. I
gave him C.P.R.,Called 9-1-1.
Oh! Thank you.
Thank you.
When I think what-what could have happened...
well,I'm gonna get out of here.
Mr. Prudy,I want you to hurry up
and get back on your feet.
I'm not giving up.
I'm gonna be back in the store next week.
I never got that darn horse feed.
I guess I'll puta bag aside for you.
You do that.
Bree,it's me.
The police are at my house.
They're going through my stuff.
What the hell is going on?
Look,I know you're there. Pick up!
Did you have anythingto do with this?
Bree? Bree!
George,I know what you did to dr. Goldfine,
and I can see now just how sick you really are,
so please just turn yourself in,
and that way you can get the help you really need.
George?
What's going on?
Oh,I invited sister mary hotpants over for lunch.
What?
You said she touchedyour soul,
so I just want to make sure her hands are clean.
so,sister mary,tell me,
what's it likemeeting men in prison?
Do you bond with all convicts,or was carlos just special?
Well,of course,carlos is special,
but our mission doesa ton of
evangelical work with several prisons.
Oh,I get it.
Sort of like,today's convictis tomorrow's convert.
Something like that,
but mostly I do charity work.
Are you two involvedin any charities?
Currently? No.
But we should be. I mean,let's face it,gaby.
Buying more stuff isn't gonna make our lives any better.
Exactly.
Money can't buy happiness.
Well,sure it can.
That's just a lie we tell poor people
to keep 'em from rioting.  Gaby!
It's a joke. Lighten up.
Can you believe this?
I'm married to a woman so selfish,
she makes fun of the entireconcept of charity.
You are a hypocrite.
The money you spentto buy your sports car
could buy a mud hutfor every peasant in ecuador.
Okay,you're right.
But I'm evolving,starting right now.
Sister,I would like to donatemy car to your mission.
What?
Carlos,are you sure?
Absolutely.
Gabrielle and I don't need two cars. We can share one.
Share? What if you have the car,
and I need to go shopping?
We're gonna cut back on shopping,too.
Okay,I think we should all just calm down a little bit.
I'm gonna get you that pink slipright now.
Carlos...
we're doing this.
I have to-ahem. Uh,here have some of this.
No one needs to know.
Don't even bother. You're not talking me out of this.
I'm not here to talk you out of anything.
Check in this drawer.
Carlos,I wanna apologize for the way I've been acting.
I mean,here you are trying to turn your life around,
and all I can think about are my stupid jealousy issues.
Yeah,well,let's just get back down there.
No,I mean it. I'm sorry.
I wanna be a better person,too.
I'm sick of being bad.
Forgive me?
You're not a bad person.
Really?
No,of course not.
That's so sweet.
I feel so close to youright now.
gaby.
I'm sorry. Guess i am bad.
Look,we got a nun downstairs.
She can wait five minutes. We're giving her a car.
Hey,pat,what's going on?
I'm not sure.
Ed keeps calling people into his office.
I think people are getting fired.
Lynette.
Yeah.
Lynette...
nina's out. You're in.
You areour new V.P. Of accounts.
I... am?
I just gave her the ax,
along with a bunch of other people.
Why? What happened?
Our old pal stu just filed a sexual harassment
suit against the company.
He did what?
He fired a fancy lawyer whothreatened
to go to the press.
I had no choicebut to pay him off.
He had a video of himand nina together.
Okay. I... get nina,but
why are you firingeverybody else?
Stu's taking us to the cleaners.
If I don't cut backon staff,
the next roundof paychecks are gonna bounce.
Oh,god,ed. I am so sorry.
Well,it's not your fault. We'll get through this.
You and me together.
Oh,can you run down to the art department?
Someone's gotta can jeff and elizabeth.
Yeah. Sure. I'm gonna goand take care of that.
Hey. Congratulations.
This... is not what I wanted.
I just wanted youto be nicer.
You know what?I used to be nice. but
our boss-I'm sorry. Your boss...
is incompetent and selfish
and has the attention spanof a poodle.
I mean,from day one,
I have been the only one around here
keeping this placefrom crumbling down
around his stupid ears.
Oh,nina,come on.
This is the truth here.
Nice is a luxury that I gave up
along with vacations and relationships
and eating at home.
This job sucks you dry.
So you better kiss those four little kiddies
of yours good-bye
because you have just adopted
the neediest little childin the world.
Here.
You're gonna need this more than I do.
Hi.
Carlos will be down in a little while.
We had an intense talk.
He's resting.
Yeah,I overheard some of your... talk.
Sorry. He's such an animal
but since we have a couple of minutes,
why don't we,uh,chat?
Look,I don't meanany disrespect.
It's just,now that carlos is home,
we need to get backon our routine,
and we can't do that if he keeps running off to church
and charity bake sales.
We need "us" time. Do you know what I mean?
I do.
Oh,good. Good.
So it would really help our marriage
if you just backed off for a while,okay?
No.
Huh?
I said no.
I know what you said. I'm wondering why you said it.
Carlos isa diamond in the rough,
a flawed man to be sure,
but someone who is desperately searching
for something to believe in.
To satisfy your materialism,
he ended up breaking the law.
To deal with your adultery,he resorted to assault.
As long as he's with you,
he will never find what he's looking for.
Well,I guess he should have thought of that
before he married me.
Some marriagesare meant to be annulled.
What the hell kind of nunare you?
Look,if you try to comebetween me and my husband,
I will take you down.
I grew up onthe south side of chicago.
If you wanna threaten me,
you're gonna have to doa lot better than that.
You listen to me,you little bitch.
You do not want to start a war with me.
well,I have god on my side.
Bring it on.
you called for a bellman?
There's a charity dinnertaking place downstairs.
My friend bree van de kampis one of the co-chairs.
Give her this noteand walk away.
If she comes upin the elevator,call me.
You think you can do that?
Yes,sir.
Excuse me,ma'am?
Yes
I was asked to give this to you.
Oh,thank you.
Barton.
Hello,detective barton. This is bree van de kamp.
I need to talk to you about george williams.
Yeah,I was just gettingready to call you,
mrs. Van de kamp.
My men are at his house right now,
and they've uncovered evidence that suggests
mr. Williams was responsible
for your husband's death.
What?  Yeah,we found
rex's prescription bottles
and doctored potassium pills
as well as some disturbing diary entries.
Mrs. Van de kamp?
Hello,sir.
Yes. She's,uh,on her way up.
Thank you very much.
She loves me.
She loves me not.
She loves me.
she loves me not.
She loves me.
operator,
this is a bit embarrassing, but I've...
I've swallowed some pillsby mistake.
I think you need to callan ambulance.
uh,uh,uh,they were-
they were just vitamins
see? False alarm. I'm fine.
Door's open.
Hey.
What were you thinking,taking the pills?
I didn't hurt dr. Goldfine.
And for you to...
think me capable of...
that sort of...
violence...
george.
George.
I'm sorry. It's the pills.
Why are you telling me this?
Because maybe I don't have to die.
I could face the police
knowing that youwould be there for me...
that you'd stay my friend.
Then I'll have somethingto live for.
And then we'll call an ambulance
and they'll pump your stomach.
Yes.
I want to help you,
but in order to do that,
I need to forgive you, and...
I can't do that until you admit what you've done.
I didn't push goldfine.
Yes,you did.
But that's not what I'm talking about.
You killed rex.
But I know it wasn't totally your fault
because you're not well.
So if you'll just be honest with me,
I can forgive you.
It'll be the hardest thing I've ever done,
but I'll do it.
But you have to-you have to tell me the truth.
look,I'm in trouble here.
We need to call someone.
Not until you admit what you've done.
I love you.
Anything I may have done,I did for you.
Because you wanted me to.
You know you did.
we need to callthe ambulance.
I... called them while you were asleep.
They're already on their way.
It's not always that easy to distinguish
the good guys from the bad guys.
Sinners can surprise you.
And the same is true for saints.
Why do we try to define people
as simply good or simply evil?
Because no one wants to admit that
compassion and cruelty
can live side by side in one heart...
and that anyone is capable of anything.
Previously on... Desperate Housewives
did you leave the door open?
Call the police!
Is that the guy who broke into your house?
Arrests were made... yeah,that's him.
I just want a chance to get to know you.
Well,I don't want to know you.
Fathers were confronted...
who's sister mary bernard?
You do not want to start a war with me.
Bring it on.
Boundaries were drawn...
mr. Williams was responsible for your husband's death.
And everyone learned that sometimes justice is served...
we need to call an ambulance.
Without saying a word.
There were many ways to tell Bree van de kamp was a lady.
Thank you very much.
She was courteous to those around her,
she moved with elegance and grace
and she was very careful to never let others know
what she was thinking.
Mrs. Van de kamp,thank you for coming on such short notice.
So what's happened?
Have you had any luck finding george?
You see,like most well-bred women...
george is dead.
He committed suicide last night at a hotel.
Bree had something to hide.
Oh,um...
well,um,it was very good of you to tell me in person,truly.
Actually,uh,there's more.
More?
Do you recognize this?
Those are my panties. How did you...
we assume mr. Williams stole them.
Where did you find them?
Mr. Williams had a room filled with,um... unsavory items.
It was like a shrine.
"Unsavory items"?Well,what does that mean?
You don't want to know.
Just so you're aware,the "daily tribune"
is starting to sniff around this story.
The editor's a good friend of mine.
I'm pretty sure I can quash it,
but you might want to tell your family what's going on,
just in case.
What is that?
I am so sorry. You weren't supposed to see that.
Mudge,get that out of here.
No,wait!Is that supposed to be me?
Well...
it's hard to say.
I don't understand. I mean
what would george be doing with a life-size doll?
oh,dear lord.
Go ahead.
Oh,hold it
What are you gonna do with that?
Well,until we close the file on mr. Williams,
she's considered evidence.
We'll have to take her back to the station.
I am so sorry about this,Mrs. Van de kamp.
I know how difficult all this must be.
Don't you worry about me,detective Barton.
I will be just fine.
Yes,there were many ways to tell that bree was a lady,
but the surest was to watch how she maintained her dignity
in even the most undignified of situations.
It's a story as old as time itself-
the return of the prodigal son.
And no matter how many times it's repeated...
or how the details might vary...
or how the names might change...
the story always ends the same way...
in the tender embrace of a loving father.
Hi,dad.
Susan mayer told me she gave you some money to go to Utah.
Yeah,I had no idea where to look for you,though,
and the money started to run out,
so I thought that maybe you'd come back here.
You're a smart kid.
Can I ask you something?
Of course. Anything.
Well,when you left town,
Mrs. Tillman said that my real mother was
a junkie from Utah.
That's right.
So...
who's my dad?
I don't know.
It could have been anyone.
Thanks for the faucet.
This leak is driving me crazy.
What do I owe you?
Oh,it's no rush.
Just pay me when I install it.
Hey,there!
Have you seen today's paper?
No,not yet.
Ohh. There's a follow-up on that guy you caught last week.
"Police seek help in identifying mystery vagrant. "
They don't know the man's name yet?
They're not even sure that he knows how to talk.
Think they're going to hold him in the psych ward
until they figure out who he is
Well,I will certainly rest easier knowing that
he's not roaming around our neighborhood.
see you!
Thanks again for the faucet.
Sure.
What are we gonna do about Caleb?
Obviously,we are going to go and get him
Where are my cuffs?
Bottom drawer.
Ah.
So when do I tell people you'll be back?
Couple,maybe three days.
What the hell's this?
It's the ball gag.
I thought you wanted it.
We do not recycle ball gags.
Take a look at the teeth marks.
it's gross.
I'd like to think that we're better than that.
Hey, Monroe?
You sure you don't want any help?
The guy's dangerous.
He's a half-wit,Jerry.
If I can handle you,
I can handle him.
So he poisoned Rex?
Sweet,little George Williams.
Well,it turns out he wasn't so sweet after all.
Anyway,there's a chance that some of this may wind up in the paper,
so I wanted you to hear it from me first.
Bree,I'm so sorry.
Yeah,like you haven't been through enough.
God,and he's our pharmacist.
It's enough to turn you holistic.
I know this sounds awful,
but I'm kind of glad the guy's dead.
Oh,I hope that little creep suffered.
Well,we'll never know.
That's Andrew back from camp hennessey.
I've got to go.
Does he know yet?
He hasn't got a clue.
How do you think he's gonna react?
All right,what the hell is going on?
I know you didn't take me out of kid jail for my health.
I'll get back to you later.
So are the police sure?
Yeah.
They found data in George's personal computer
and also records at his pharmacy that
pretty much proves that he was poisoning your father.
Did they say why he killed him?
Well,the detective seems to think he was trying to
get your father out of the way so...
he could marry me.
Honey,please use your coaster.
That's gonna leave a ring.
My father was murdered because of you,
so as far as I'm concerned,
you no longer get to tell me what to do.
Andrew,that is not fair.
You brought that psycho into our house!
You sat him down at our table.
Just how fair do you expect me to be?
Andrew,George williams fooled a lot of people.
Yeah,well,he didn't fool me.
Andrew,I'm not trying to minimize my part in this.
Believe me,I hate myself for what's happened.
Good.
Now we have something in common.
Oh,by the way,
I'm gonna call my friend justin
and have him come over and spend the night tonight.
Justin? Is he a friend of yours from school or church?
What kind of friend is he?
The real good kind.
Andrew,it is inappropriate for you to have somebody over.
You just got home.
Like I said,
you don't get to tell me what to do anymore.
You came.
Did I have a choice?
Well,sure.
Because at the hospital,you sounded like you were
fully prepared to blackmail me
into having some kind of a relationship with you.
That was just the heat of the moment,
and once you get to know me,you'll understand that
I am not the kind of person who could ever,ever resort to blackmail.
Well,I wish you'd made that clear in the hospital.
Could have saved me a trip.
So are you coming in?
Well,I got a lunch hour to kill.
That was my first halloween. I was 2.
What do you think I am?
I don't know
Oh,come on,just guess. You can tell.
Uh,a homeless person?
No,Addison,I'm a chicken.
See? Those are feather shanging around.
Oh. I thought that was supposed to be trash.
Uh,look,are we done here?
You haven't even finished your coffee.
I got to get back to work.
Oh,well,we-we haven't even finished the high school years.
I wanted to show you this one.
This was from the father-daughter dance.
I had to take my mother'shairstylist.
What do you want from me,susan?
Well,I-I just want to share more than our D.N.A. I...
I wanted to have a relationship with you.
None of this means anything to you?
I'll take the hobo picture.
Actually,it was... fine.
What's this?
Our company insurance policy. You ever bother to read it?
I'm going to say no,but don't tell.
We have day care, Ed, day care.
Do you realize that since we fired half the staff,
you and I have barely left the building?
My kids are forgetting who I am.
I hear you. I have 17-month-old
who I haven't actually seen awake in weeks.
See? All we need isa minimum participation
of,uh... 16 kids.
My kids,your baby,
sally in accounting has three,
that new guyin human resources has two
and we hit the mother lode with the mormon receptionist.
She just popped out number 6.There. 16.
15. My wife won't do it.
Well,maybe if I talkedto her.
No,I'm telling you,this day care thing is a non-starter.
Fran won't even let anyone else hold the baby.
Well,she won't just take sometime off for a couple of hours?
Lynette,if I hadn'tcut that umbilical cord with my own two hands,
I swear they would still be attached.
But if you want to try...
more power to you.
You! What the hell did you do with my husband?!
Please restrain yourself,gabrielle.
You're in a house of god.
Tell me where he is!
Everywhere,of course.
Not god,my husband.
Gaby,what are you doing here?
I was just about to ask you the same thing.
You were supposed to meet me at the spa.
I was just helping sister mary with the mailings for the fund-raiser.
The church is about to senda relief team to Botswana
to help with the drought.
That's your excuse?
We missed side-by-side water massages.
I had to book them weeks in advance.
Okay,you missed a massage.
It's unfortunate,but there are people dying in Botswana.
There are going to be people dying in this church
if you don't wipe that patronizing look off your face!
What is your problem?
Sister mary,will you excuse us,please?
Certainly.
We are supposed to be working on our marriage,carlos,
but we can't do thatas long as our lady of perpetual stick-up-her-butt
has you worrying about thirsty orphans.
You're blaming sister mary for the tension in our marriage?
She wants us fighting.
She wants you to get tired of me
and walk out so she can have you all to herself.
That's crazy. She's a nun.
She may wear a habit and the beads,
but at the end of the day,
she is still a woman,just like me,
and I know what I'm capable of.
She is a woman...
but she is nothing like you.
Carlos,where are you going?
Carlos!
You look tense,gabrielle.
Perhaps you should think about getting a massage.
hi, Susan,it's Addison. Are you there?
Hi. Hi,yeah,I'm here.
Good. You're home.
Uh-huh. What's up?
You know you were saying you wanted to be part of my life?
Yeah.
I'm at the police station.
I need you to come bail me out.
Solicitation? You were arrested for solicitation?
It was entrapment. I'm the victim here.
But you were with a prostitute.
Apparently not.
I asked her three times-"are you a cop?"
They got to tell you,but she didn't say "boo. "
I thought this was America!
Addison,you just got caught paying for sex.
Now is not the time to wrap yourself in the flag.
Don't give me that look.
It wasn't my fault. I'm sorry.
How is trying to pick up a hooker not your fault?
I was at the store,I was working on my computer
and then,you know,they have these ads?
They pop up on the screen and they ask if you want to have a hot date.
Well,it gets a fellow worked up.
Can't you just go home and have sex with your wife like a normal person?
She's a 68-year-old woman.
That bell stopped ringing for me years ago.
Oh,my god. Stop. Right now.
I'm gonna gopay this thing.
So am I off the hook now?
What?
This whole father-daughter thing,
we're done,right?
Thursday,coffee at 2.Be on time.
Don't take this the wrong way,but are you dim?
Okay,I didn't exactly love what I found out about you today,
but the goal was to learn,not to judge.
I bring the coffee.
That crap you made burnt a hole in my stomach.
This is tunde.
He lost both his parents to this drought.
In fact,water is always scarce in botswana.
The national currency is called the pula or raindrop...
hello, Gabrielle. What brings you here?
I'm concerned about the drought in Kenya.
Botswana.
Yeah,and you?
Well,I'm organizing this relief trip.
We leave in a week.
Well, Bon voyage,father.
I'm not going myself.
We had to scale back our relief efforts this year.
We even had to cut a few of the aid workers from the trip.
Sister Mary,sister Gret awere so disappointed.
If you just want to hand some of...
sister mary was going on the trip?
Well,sister mary always goes for at least a few months,
but when our funding came up short,
she graciously offered to step aside,
said there's plenty of god's work to do here.
Thank you, Carlos. Appreciate it.
I bet she did.
How much cash are you short,father?
We plan to set up a modern system of irrigation.
I'm sorry to interrupt,sister mary,
but I have an announcement.
I have just received a donation of $8,000,
which means that sister Mary and sister Greta
will be able to join our relief trip to Botswana.
it just goes to show angels are everywhere.
Hey. I'm here to see Lynette Scavo.
Oh,hi. Excuse me. Hi.
I'm lynette. You must be Fran.
Hi. Ed said you needed to talk to me.
I couldn't imagine about what.
Oh,well,come on in my office.
You want me to put my daughter in day care?
But I'm a stay-at-home mom.
I'm not suggesting that you sign her up for all day.
Maybe just a couple of hours in the afternoon.
Wouldn't that be great?
Have some time to yourself, relax, unwind?
I don't need to unwind. I love taking care of little Mindy.
Oh,of course,of course,
but we all have days when we're starting to lose it.
Wouldn't it be nice to have some place to take her
before you want to strangle her?
I cherish every moment I spend with her,truly.
Really?
Yeah. Look,I'm gonna level with you.
Parcher and Murphy can't have a day care center
unless we haveat least 16 kids
and without little Mindy,we only have 15.
Well,that's not my problem.
Okay. Okay. I just thought I'd give it a shot.
Well,I wish I could help you,but I can't.
Okay.
Lynette
Yeah
Can I ask you something?
Yeah
Why did you have kids if you weren't gonna raise them?
Excuse me? Well,I just don't understand who
say they want to be mothers,
but then hand their kids over to glorified babysitters.
I work because my family needs me to.
Oh,dear,I've upset you, and that wasn't my intention.
I bet.
Make no mistake,I'm a good mother.
That's the difference between us-
I couldn't settle for being a good mother.
I want to be a great one.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
Oh,hi,alberta. How are you?
Were you the one that sent out those neighborhood watch pamphlets?
I was wondering if maybe you had any extra copies.
Or I'll just borrow one from somebody else. Thanks.
Yep,looks like carol'spenmanship.
This is ridiculous. What does she think,we're having an affair?
Well,she probably saw you drop me off yesterday,
and she assumed the worst.
Well,now you're gonna have to tell her the truth.
Oh,no,no,no. I'd catch holy hell.
Oh,so you want me to catch it for you?
I mean, you, yourselfs aid she's crazy.
I don't want to wake up tomorrow morning and find my tires slashed.
All right. I'll talk to her.
Hello, Edie. Do you have something you'd like to say?
No. That pretty much says it all.
Sister Mary,what a lovely surprise.
Well,I couldn't leave withoutsaying good-bye, Gabrielle.
Oh,that's so sweet.
I'm really gonna miss you.
I'm sure not half as much as you're gonna miss your husband.
Huh?
Don't freak out.
I'm going to botswana.
What?!
Sister Mary needs a companion.
What happened to sister Greta?!
I was gonna go with sister Greta,but the region is so volatile,
I decided I'd feel much safer with a male companion.
Carlos,you can't do this.
You can't just goto Africa.
Honey,I'm only gonna be gone for two months.
This journey is important for me.
I want to be one of god's soldiers.
And you will be one, Carlos.
After you see the devastation over there,
you're never the same.
You see how selfish your old life is
and you just want to get rid of everything that reminds you of it.
Oh, Gosh. I should get goingand start packing.
We leave in less than a week.
I should probably send a thankyou letter to my parole officer.
He's being a real mensch about this.
I may be a catholic,but I am so not above slapping a nun.
Go ahead.
Do it.
Just make sure you hit hard enough to leave a mark.
Yeah. I didn't think so.
Kiss the kids good night and I'll see themin the morning
Okay,yeah. I love you,too. Bye-bye.
I'm sorry about the day care thing, Lynette,
but Fran hardly ever lets me hold the kid.
You know,since day one,all I ever got was,
"support the head,support the head. "
I think I know how to support a damn baby head.
Ohh,let's just-let's just do this.
I don't want to be here all night.
you're Mindy's father.
You have a right to spend time with her.
I know,but what can I do?
You could stand up to Fran.
If you don't,you'll just become more resentful,
she'll get nuttier.
And without a father figure,
poor mindy will grow up to be a stripper.
A stripper?
There's science to back that up.
You know what?
You go ahead and push the button on this day care thing, Lynette,
and count Mindy in.
Yeah,I'll handle Fran.
You're doing the right thing, Ed,
for little Mindy.
yeah.
dude,what if your mom walks in?
She won't.
You don't know that.
Just wait till everybody's asleep.
Seriously.
I'll make it worth your while.
You better.
I wish she would walk in on us,
just to see the expression on her face.
God,I hate her so much.
Still, though,she's your mother.
Don't you sort of have to love her?
Last year,when she found out that I like guys,
she freaked out.
She said that if I didn't change, I'd be going straight to hell,
so since I knew that I couldn't change,
it suddenly hit me that
one day,my own mother was gonna stop loving me,
so I decided to stop loving her first.
That way,it wouldn't hurt so bad.
She didn't know what she was saying.
Yes,she did,
so now she's gotto be punished.
How are you gonna punish her?
One day,she'll slip up,
and I'll have something against her
and when that happens,
I'm gonna take her down so hard,she'll never get back up.
It may take you a while to get something on her.
That's Okay.
I don't mind waiting for the things that I want.
Lynette,hey,hey. Look who's here.
Hey!
You know,the day care room won't be ready until next week at the earliest.
If I had waited,I might have lost my nerve.
I had a window.
Fran was in the shower,so I just grabbed the baby and ran.
You took the baby without telling Fran?
I refuse to be bullied by that woman. You were right.
Mindy is my daughter,I wanted to spend time with her.
I have that right.
Um,Ed,the lobby just called and your wife's on her way up
and she seems pretty angry.
Oh,man.
Here. Hold mindy.
Oh.
Let me handle this.
Oh,I was planning to.
I thought Mindy had been kidnapped!
I left a sticky note.
I wasn't looking fora sticky note,ed!
I was looking for my missing child!
She's my child,too,and she's staying here,
just a few hours a day.
You,give her to me.
No,I made a decision.
Yeah? Okay,watch me make a decision.
I'm done with this marriage.
I'm taking my baby and I'm getting on a plane to pittsburgh.
You wouldn't dare!
You think you miss mindy now,
wait till we're livingwith my mother!
I'll fight you on this.
Yeah? Try...
as Lynette saw her dreams of day care about to board a plane to pittsburgh,
You're crazy,you know that?!
Yeah! I'm crazy to think...
she decided this flight would have to be grounded.
You don't scare me.
Oh. Oh!
What the hell is she doing?!
Open up! Give me my baby!
Good thinking,lynette!
I am not on your side,ed
You're not?
No,I am on mindy's side.
She is the one caught in the middle,
and I'm not letting you two have her until you calm down.
I want my damn child.
Lynette,I have tom on line two.
Pat, can you see here I'm holding a baby hostage?!
I will call back!
All right,that's it.
I'm calling the police.
Oh,for god's sakes!
Lynette'snot going to hurt the baby!
No,and you're gonna get herback a whole lot faster
if you will just listen to me,okay?
Listen,and you?All right,good.
So first of all, Ed,stealing the baby was really stupid.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
You need to find a better way to communicate with your wife.
And, Fran,I know what the pressure of trying to be
a super parent does to your head.
You can take a break and be a great mom.
Doesn't this little sweetheart deserve a well-rested mommy?
Well,I guess the pressure does get to me a little.
And it's Okay to admit that.
This is communication. This is good.
Why don't you guys go down to the lobby,
talk it out over some coffee?
Uh,what about Mindy?
We've got day care!
We've got day care
Hi.
I called earlier from the spiritual outreach program?
Hi. Piano player,right?
This is so generous of you.
There it is.
It's not exactly a concert grand.
I should warn you,
on the whole,our patients are generally unresponsive,
so I hope you don't expect a lot of clapping.
Miss Delaney, I find when the spiritual rewards are this great,
who needs applause?
Excuse me.
Did Addison talk to you about me?
Oh!I guess not.
He's a married man!
What's wrong with you?!
No,wait! Wait!
It's not what you think!
He hasn't touched me for three years
because of sluts like you!
Carol, if you would just stop throwing things at me, I'll explain!
How-how can you explain?!
You're screwing my husband! No, I'm not screwing him!
He's my father!
I'm so sorry.
I thought you should know, but he didn't want to tell you.
I want to die.
Oh,no.
I do.
Oh, Carol, you don't have to clean that up.
They have clerks for that.
How old are you?
38.
We've been married 39 years.
It's been going on from the start.
Believe me, I didn't want to hurt anyone. I just
wanted to find my dad.
I'm glad you did,
but you be careful,sweetheart.
He's gonna break your heart.
Andrew,I made an appointment with a therapist for you, me and Danielle.
I don't think so.
This pain that you're feeling is completely natural,
but it's not gonna go away until you deal with it.
Andrew,
I want us to heal,I want us to be a family again.
You know what I want?
I want for George Williams to walk through that door
so I can take a knife and plunge it into his heart.
I want the pharmacist to pay for what he did to my father.
Well,the good news is he's... he's dead.
He committed suicide.
His death was on his terms.
That's not justice.
So are you saying if he were
executed that it would be easier for you to get past this?
Of course.
George...
didn't intend to commit suicide.
He was trying to manipulate meinto taking him back,
and he swallowed those pills hoping that I'd feel sorry for him.
He just assumed that I would call an ambulance.
When I got there,he was already slipping away.
I tried to get him to
accept responsibility for what he'd done...
but he wouldn't.
So what'd you do?
Nothing.
I just sat there and let him die.
Oh,my god.
He didn't die on his terms,andrew.
He paid for what he did to your father.
Thank you for telling me this.
Hey, how you doin'?
Yeah?
Zach's come home.
What?
Is he okay?
He's fine.
Is there anything I can do?
Thanks for asking.
You can leave us alone.
I spent a lot of time looking for zach,
and you know why.
Maybe I'm notmaking myself clear.
You come near my son, I'll go to the police.
I'll tell them what happened out in that quarry.
You do that and we'll both go down.
Well,
you know I'm capable of almost anything.
Hey,I thought you'd like to know
zach and I are moving away.
I want to give my son a shot at a normal life.
I'm sure you'll agree it's for the best.
Now see, this is where you and I don't see eye-to-eye.
For zach's sake, I'll keep quiet, for now,
but you're not taking him away.
If I see a "for sale" sign in front of that house,
I'll call the police.
I'm capable of pretty much anything myself.
the doctor's going to give you a full work-up,
then we'll start the inoculations.
Make sure you fill out everything
and the nurse will take you back.
Thank you.
Boy,Sister Mary's done a number on you.
Right.
Yes,right.
She has you flying halfway across the world to help the poor
and there'sperfectly good poor right here.
For god's sakes, give a buck to a homeless guy.
It's not the same.
No,it's better
because you can do it in the comfort of your own car.
The point is not to be comfortable,gaby.
It's about easing pain and suffering.
Look,I'm trying to bea better person here.
Now you can either help meor you can get out of the way,
but you can't stop me.
Carlos Solis?
Come with me,please.
Finish that for me.
here.
He didn't fill out the allergy section.
Honey,he's going to a remote village in africa.
Does it really matter that he's allergic to eggs?
Actually,yes. Eggs are on the list.
He could have a severe reaction to the yellow fever vaccine,
and he won't be getting out of bed,let alone leaving the country.
Really?
Oh,don't write that down.
I wasn't being specific.
He's allergic to fish eggs.
Fish eggs?
Poor baby's gone his whole life without caviar.
Now that's suffering.
All right, doc,give me all you got.
It's so hot in this village.
Baby,that's the fever talking.
The doctor said you're having an allergic reaction,
but you're gonna be fine,okay?
Hold me.
Ohh,honey. I'm so sorry.
Ohh,maybe that stupid nun is right.
Maybe I am trying to stop you from becoming a better person.
It's just that I love you the way you are-
greedy, selfish and insensitive.
I'm just scared if you're not those things anymore,
you're gonna wake up one day
and realize I still am,
and then you won't want me.
I want you. Just hold me.
Ohh,Carlos.
Hold me...
Sister Mary.
Painting in the rain?
Is that smart?
Well,let me see,painting in the rain
or letting the whole world think I'm a whore?
I don't know. What do you think?
Heard you ran into my wife.
Yep.
So?
So you are hereby released of any further obligation to be my dad.
Okay.
Just so you know,
I'm not actually proud of what I've done
you know, my hobbies.
Good for you.
Bye.
I have done things I'm proud of.
I could give you five examples right now.
Okay,maybe three.
You don't have to do this.
I was a volunteer fireman.
I put out fires,I got kittens out of trees,the whole nine yards.
Sweet.
About 20 years ago,I started a foundation to
protect wild horses. I probably saved hundreds of them.
Really?
I'm full of surprises.
Okay,one more.
I wasn't exactly thrilled when you walked back into my life.
Now that I've met you,
well,you gave me a third thing to be proud of.
That was a good one.
That's why I saved it for last.
I have to spend some time working on my marriage.
When that's all sorted out,
maybe we could continue with the
catching up?
I'll wait for your call.
The stories are as old as time itself...
the prodigal son who returns home
to the father who forgives him...
the jealous wife who tricks the husband who trust her...
the desperate mother
who risks everything for the child who needs her
and the faithless husband
who hurts the wife who loves him so deeply.
Why do we listen again and again?
Because these are the stories of family,
and once we look past the fighting, pain and the resentment,
we occasionally like to remind ourselves...
There is absolutely nothing more important.
Hi, bunny, bunny. Hi.
Previously on "Desperate Housewives":
George paid for what he did to your father.
Bree confessed...
Did you give Zach money to go to Utah?
Susan betrayed Mike...
What kind of friend is he?
The real good kind.
Andrew pushed the boundaries...
Zach's come home.
Is there anything I can do?
Paul put his foot down...
You can leave us alone.
So when do I tell people you'll be back?
Couple, maybe three days.
And a stranger finally caught up with Caleb.
Kisses are such simple things,
we hardly notice them.
But if we paid more attention,
we'd see that each kiss conveys a meaning all its own.
For example,
some can say, "I'm so happy to see you. "
Or, "I didn't realize you'd be here. "
Bye.
Or, "honey, it's time to stop drinking. "
The trick is in knowing how to tell the difference.
So I finally said, if I'm head cheerleader,
then nobody wears panties.
Yeah!
I just want you to know as a former member
of my high school marching band, I would've appreciated that.
Wait a second, you were a band geek?
Oh, I don't believe it.
What did you play?
He played the tuba. I have pictures.
The tuba, huh?
Yeah, go ahead, come on, come on, get your licks in, go ahead.
No, no, not at all. As a matter of fact,
all of my secret crushes were on the band geeks.
Come on, I know you cheerleader types.
You wouldn't have said "boo" to guys like me.
No, you were more interested in the guys like like this. Now,
I take it you didn't play the tuba.
No, I didn't.
All I know is, I was a lonely, insecure tuba player.
Girls like Gabrielle would just rip my heart out.
Aw.
I didn't even had my first kiss until I was 18.
18?
Pathetic, I know.
Poor baby. I would've kissed you.
No, you wouldn't have.
Yes, I would have.
No, you wouldn't have. And it's okay, Gaby.
Those scars healed a long time ago.
Oh, for God sakes, come here.
Now on behalf of all the cheerleaders in the world,
forgive us.
Oh, yeah! Whoo!
Yes, kisses mean different things to different people.
Ultimately, the meaning depends
on the one who does the kissing...
Wowie.
Cheers.
...and the one who sees it happen.
2x11:
One More Kiss
After every party
comes the time for cleaning.
We attend to the champagne
that was spilled,
the knickknacks that got broken,
the food that went uneaten.
Oh, here, let me take that.
And whatever other messes need cleaning up.
So, uh, Gaby...
you know that thing
you and Tom did tonight?
The the kiss?
Was that hysterical?
The look on Tom's face!
Yeah.
I know this sounds silly,
but...
it kind of bugged me.
You're not serious.
Yeah, I am.
I don't-
I don't want to make a big deal out of it,
but, uh,
could you maybe
not do that again?
Okay.
Thanks.
Okay.
Hey, what happened to the Applewhites?
I thought you were gonna invite them.
I did. Betty never R.S.V.P.'d.
What do you guys think about the Applewhites?
I like 'em, very nice.
Very...
interesting.
Right, interesting.
Hmm, they weird me out, too.
Well, that's not what we're saying.
Not exactly, anyway.
You know, we were just having fun,
entertaining the crowd.
Oh, sure, but...
but maybe next time you could try juggling instead.
What's going on?
Nothing.
Really?
I sense a little tension.
No, no tension.
What?
You make it sound like...
I was making a pass at your husband.
And that's just a little bit insulting.
I just said it bugged me.
Why is that a problem?
Is this about that kiss?
What kiss?
Oh, you were in the living room.
Gaby planted a big, wet kiss
on Tom... as a joke.
It was hilarious.
You see?
Yeah, but to be fair to Lynette,
you are an ex-model.
And surely it must have dawned on you that some women
might prefer it if you didn't kiss their husbands.
That's all I'm saying.
Oh, you guys, we're all friends.
This isn't something to get worked up over.
I'm not worked up.
Me neither.
Hey, everyone,
did you see what Kathy Lewis was wearing tonight?
And whoever told her that she could get away
with those vertical stripes should be shot.
Oh.
Bye, sweetie.
Zach is back!
Yeah, yeah, I know.
You do?
Yeah, he's been back for a couple of days now.
Well, that's great, isn't it?
Yeah.
I thought you'd be happy about it.
I thought that's what you wanted.
I was hoping that I'd slowly establish
a relationship with Zach
and then when we were comfortable,
I'd tell him I was his real dad.
But now Paul's back.
And he doesn't want you anywhere near him.
He's threatened to tell the police
everything that happened in the desert-
that I held a gun to his head.
Well, it's your word against his.
But he doesn't have a record, and I do.
You know, despite what I did-
sending Zach away,
I want you two to connect.
I hope you know that.
I do.
And on the bright side,
I don't have to wonder where he is anymore.
It says that you can do a report on anything
from the suggested reading list,
which includes "The old man and the sea,"
"The pearl,"
"Much ado about nothing. "
Hmm.
That sounds good. What do you like?
I don't care.
Let's start with "The pearl. "
It's got a sad ending, but it's good.
We'll start with that.
You know,
it's not gonna be so bad.
I think you're really gonna like home-schooling.
Okay,
I know this isn't what you want.
But I need to keep you close to me
just for a while.
There are people in this neighborhood
who aren't thrilled that we're back.
People I don't trust.
People like... Mike Delfino?
Why would you say that?
When you disappeared,
Mrs. Tillman said that Mike took you somewhere to kill you.
That's ridiculous. Why would Mike wanna kill me?
Because you murdered Mrs. Huber?
What did you say?
Well, Mrs. Tillman said that you murdered Mrs. Huber
because she was blackmailing mom.
And you believed her?
No, not exactly.
I mean, why? Should I?
Zach, you know me
better than anyone.
Do you honestly believe that I am capable of murder?
No.
All right, then.
Of course...
I didn't think mom was capable of suicide, either.
On second thought,
why don't we start with "Much ado about nothing"?
I think we could use a few laughs around here.
Yeah, man...
Yeah, he sure is. I just...
Probably.
Yeah.
Hey.
Get over here. Now.
Somebody's angry.
Did one of your souffls fall?
I saw what you did with your friend.
Oh, and you didn't turn into a pillar of salt. Good for you.
This is not a joke, Andrew.
What if the neighbors had seen you?
Well, I'd hope they'd think that I'd landed a hottie.
I may not be able to control
what you do outside of this home,
but while you are under this roof,
you will not mock my values.
If you so much as smile at that boy,
so help me, I will ship you off to Camp Hennessey
and I will not pick you up again until you are 18.
Do I make myself clear?
Aren't you forgetting something?
I know you like to knock a few back before bedtime.
Go on, take it. It's okay.
We both know that of the two of us,
I'm the one that doesn't judge.
Please. I don't wanna stay down here.
I I know.
I'm sorry, K.
I'm sorry.
Matthew, I think we might have termites.
You need to take a look at those steps
before one of us breaks our neck.
What's the matter? Is your brother okay?
No, he's not. He hates it down here.
He wants to be with us. You're being cruel.
If you are so concerned about him,
you should spend less time on your computer
and more time down here keeping him company.
We're bringing him up,
but not until I am sure that it's safe.
Hey, you!
Yeah?
What's the deal?
You've been parked on our street for two hours.
Oh, I'm doing a property appraisal.
Some neighbors of yours are thinking about moving.
The Applewhites?
I'm not really allowed to say.
I sold them that house. You know, this is my turf!
Who do you work for?
Geist Realty?
Ah, Westside Properties.
Yeah, well, whoever it is, you go back
and you tell your bosses that nobody, and I mean, nobody,
buys or sells properties in this neighborhood
without going through Edie Britt, you got that?
Look, lady, I just go where I'm told.
You look, you cross me,
and I will be your worst nightmare.
I'm a dangerous woman.
You don't wanna mess with me.
You got it.
Ms. Mayer?
Zach.
May I talk to you?
I have some things that I need to say.
Okay.
I I know that I did a lot of bad stuff-
stuff that I'm not gonna be able to take back.
Ms. Mayer, I'm-I'm really sorry.
But when I was living on the streets, you know,
I had a lot of time to-to just sit and think to myself
and clear my head and...
I've grown up, you know? I don't want you to worry.
I'm not gonna be bothering you anymore.
Either of you.
Well, thanks. We appreciate that.
Please don't tell my dad that I talked to you.
He's just he's been really...
intense lately.
Well, what do you think?
He seems different.
I believe him.
Yeah, I can't believe I'm about to say this,
but I feel sorry for him.
It's like he's so fragile.
I know, and he's locked in that house with Mr. Creepy 24/7.
Did you know that he's homeschooling Zach now?
I think he should spend some time
with a decent role model, don't you?
Hi!
Hey, you're out early.
Oh, I just wanted to pick up
some fresh croissants for breakfast.
Oh, cool. Listen, I just wanted you to know
I appreciated you backing me up last night,
you know, with the kiss thing.
To be honest, I don't think I would've liked it, either.
Yeah, but I probably should've just gone with it.
Gaby was just being Gaby having fun.
No, I wouldn't be so hard on yourself, given her history.
What do you mean?
You know, the affair.
Gaby had an affair?
You didn't know?
No!
I thought everybody knew.
Oh, I feel awful.
Oh, Ida Greenberg's behind you.
Ida, just a second.
I am stunned.
Who was it with?
I shouldn't have said anything.
Bree, come on, just tell me.
Her gardener.
Oh, you're kidding!
No, no, not him. Helen Rowland's son, John.
The teenager?
Ida, wait, or go around!
Does Gaby know that you know?
Absolutely not.
I think the best thing to do
is just smile and pretend you don't know anything.
Hi.
Oh, sorry!
Are you okay?
Yeah.
I'm all right.
What's up?
We have an idea how to bring you and Zach together.
Bowling.
Bowling?
Yeah, I e-mailed Zach,
and he said he's gonna meet us there.
You can come, too.
Does Paul know about this?
No, and we're not planning on telling him.
I don't think that's a good idea, Susan.
Mike, I'm part of the reason things got so screwed up.
I just want a chance to make things right.
And you're okay with this being around Zach?
We talked to him. He's changed.
Well, I guess we're going bowling.
Wake up, sleepyhead.
I brought fresh croissants for breakfast!
Uh, hi, Mrs. van de Kamp.
I'm Justin, Andrew's lab partner...
from school.
Dude, wake up.
Andrew...
I want you downstairs... now.
Okay, first of all, I want you to march back upstairs
and tell your friend he is no longer welcome in this house.
But we haven't even had breakfast yet!
I am serious, Andrew.
You tell him to get out of here this second
or I will call the police,
and I will have him removed!
Well, go ahead, call 'em.
Oh, you think I won't?
I just wonder how they'll react
when they find out that you killed George Williams.
I didn't kill George.
Well, no, but you sat there and let him die,
which, I'm no lawyer, but I'm pretty sure
there's a crime in there somewhere.
Andrew...
Don't get me wrong. I mean, I'm glad you did it.
But when the cops get here, my official position will be,
uh, "oh, my God, I'm being raised by a homicidal maniac. "
I think I might even throw in a few tears.
You would actually let the police
arrest your own mother?
Hey, we all gotta cut the apron strings at some point.
Come on, Penny. Let's get those groceries in there.
Come on. Here we go. Get this one...
and this one, and daddy-uh-oh! Whoa!
Oh!
Oh, it looks like you could use a hand.
Bless you. Here, Gaby.
And Penny!
Oh, come here, you sweet little thing.
Well, thank you so much, Gaby. Come on in.
Oh, God, um, Tom?
Yeah?
Uh, I think she got sick.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
Usually, she only throws up on immediate family.
I'm honored.
Oh, um, do you mind just putting her in the playpen there?
Hello.
Guess what? Ed loved the pitch. I got off early!
You're kidding! That's great!
Hey, I'm right by the supermarket.
You want me to pick up anything?
Um, actually, I just came from there.
Except, you know what? I forgot bread.
Would you mind?
Not at all.
Tom, I need to wipe up. Do you have a towel?
Sure, hold on.
Hey!
Hey, honey.
Hey, did you get the bread?
Oh, yeah, they were out.
Of bread?
Yeah. Hey, Gaby.
A surprise seeing you here.
Well, I saw that Tom was overwhelmed,
so I thought I'd give him a hand.
Really? Wow, that was nice of you.
Is there a problem?
No.
Really?
Because I sense that you're annoyed
you found me here when you weren't home. Am I wrong?
Lynette?
Okay. yeah.
So, exactly what are you doing here helping out?
Damn it, Lynette, if this has to do with that stupid kiss
the other night, I'm gonna lose it!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, what's going on?
Lynette thinks I was hitting on you at Bree's party.
That's ridiculous.
I never said that.
What I said was that it made me uncomfortable
when you kissed him.
It's obviously an issue for me.
And yet, here you are, alone in my kitchen with my husband.
So you tell me, are you hitting on him?
Lynette.
I can't believe you. I have done nothing
to deserve this kind of mistrust.
Well, that's not entirely true.
What does that mean?
Come on, Gaby.
It's a small town. People talk.
Okay, what's going on here?
I'll tell you.
Your wife doesn't trust me around you
because I had an affair with my teenage gardener.
Oh.
So I know Susan Mayer would never tell.
It must've been Helen Rowland.
She probably blabbed to all the girls at the salon.
And Ida Greenberg goes to that salon.
So if Ida knows, the whole town knows.
And we're just gonna have to move. That's all there is to it.
Carlos, can you stop putting for two seconds
and show me some support?
What do you expect me to do?
You brought this on yourself.
It was a harmless little kiss!
Why is everybody making a big deal about this?
Because you had an affair with an underage gardener.
People don't think you're harmless.
They see you as a predator.
You're enjoying this, aren't you?
Punishing me, dangling the affair over my head?
Well, I won't tolerate it.
Really?
So just what are you gonna do about it?
I'm gonna let you even the score.
Carlos, go have an affair.
What?
I had my little indiscretion.
So you go have yours. Get it out of your system.
I know you want to.
I do not.
Sure you do. Knock yourself out.
Call up an old college flame. Rent a call girl.
Fly to Africa
and nail that little nun you've been drooling over.
I don't care!
You're crazy.
No, I'm pragmatic.
Because once you finish your fling,
we'll be equals again.
And then you won't be able to judge me.
And we can go back to being
a boring, average married couple.
Oh, just do me a favor. Don't bring back any diseases.
Are you sure you're not overreacting
to this whole Gabrielle thing?
Maybe.
Yes.
But Gaby doesn't think she did anything wrong.
That's not right, either.
I guess.
You're an attractive man.
There is a primal need for a woman to protect what is hers.
My initial impulse was justified.
So you really think she's into me?
I don't know.
Because you're right. I am an attractive man.
You know what? I've never told you this,
but sometimes when I bend down to pick up the morning paper,
I catch Bree van de Kamp checking me out.
You're kidding.
No, scout's honor.
I've always exuded a certain sexual magnetism,
and as I get older,
I think it's only becoming more intense.
Are you drunk?
Oh, I'm a hot guy living in a neighborhood
filled with nothing but lonely ladies.
Oh.
They can't help themselves. I'm like... catnip.
Come here.
What was that for?
Thank you. Thank you for reminding me
that I am the only woman in the whole world
who could love an idiot like you.
I'll talk to Gaby.
I'm telling you,
these women want me.
Oh, yeah.
They see the rippling muscles underneath this t-shirt...
Good night, Tom.
They cannot resist me.
Shut up and go to sleep.
Aah!
Son of a bitch.
You gotta be kidding me.
Whoa, whoa.
I'm here to help you, Caleb.
All right?
Mama's gon' be mad.
Don't you worry about that.
Moms love me.
All right, let's go.
No!
Okay, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have talked to you like that.
Let's start over.
Aah!
Let's go.
I'm warning you, pinhead,
don't you make me come down there after you.
Come on.
Come on!
All right, you asked for it.
I'm gonna beat the stupid right out of you.
This hit the spot.
Caleb?
I didn't do it.
Oh, dear.
Well, hey there.
Hi, Karl. Oh!
Oh, um, quick question-
when someone discusses a sensitive situation
with a lawyer such as yourself,
when does attorney/client confidentiality kick in?
From the moment the lawyer's been hired. Why?
Here's a check for $100.
That's enough for a retainer, right?
Well, I guess. What's going on, Bree?
My son is trying to blackmail me.
And I want you to stop the little S.O.B.
Do you think you could do that?
He has an Illinois license.
It says here his name is Munroe.
Does that name mean anything to you?
No, but at least he wasn't a policeman.
Poor man.
I hope he didn't suffer too much.
Mom, are we looking at the same body?
What is it?
As soon as it gets dark,
we get rid of that body.
Hey.
Um...
I hope it's okay. Carlos let me in.
Actually, I'm right in the middle of something,
and I don't know when I'll be done.
I'm just here to say I am sorry,
and I have been a complete idiot.
All done.
So cute. 'Cause it's beautiful!
Is the coast clear?
Yes, it is. We worked it out.
No kidding. How'd you manage that one?
Simple. Lynette admitted she was wrong, and I agreed.
Well, 99% wrong.
Oh, whatever, close enough.
Anyway, Tom's probably got dinner ready by now.
So I should get goin'.
Okay.
Goodbye.
Bye!
You know what the 1% is, right?
No, not really.
Does it matter?
It kinda does.
I wanna get it clear for our friendship.
Okay.
What's the 1%?
Well, well...
Yes, I overreacted.
I think you can see how,
even though I was somewhat off base,
you were a little wrong, right?
No. I kissed Tom, and it was a harmless joke.
I think if I had kissed anybody else's husband,
they would've laughed
and then forgot about it ten seconds later.
Okay, let's test that theory.
See? I don't care.
That's... just a waste of time...
and spit.
Oh. Okay.
Okay, okay, okay.
Okay! Okay!
I get your point.
All righty, then, my work here is done.
Carlos, Gaby.
Go!
Not bad.
Hey, there he is.
Zach, I'm glad you could make it.
Hey, Zach.
Mr. Delfino, I didn't know you were gonna be here.
Yeah, I was just bowling a few frames and ran into these guys.
I thought I might join you. Is, uh, that okay?
Yeah, I guess.
Oh!
Okay, write that down nine!
Wise guy.
All right, just roll it in there nice and easy.
Sorry.
It's okay. We're still close.
Anyway, Julie's totally gonna choke.
Just for that, I am not bringing you back a hot dog.
Zach, do you want one?
Okay.
You okay?
Yeah, I'm fine, it's just...
I don't understand what you're doing.
What do you mean?
Well, I don't understand why you're being so nice to me.
I mean, I pointed a gun at you guys. You should hate me.
We don't hate you, Zach.
You had an incredibly hard year.
And you shouldn't have done what you did,
but we just wanna help you move on.
Look, um...
when I was young,
I got mixed up in some really bad stuff.
I even did some time in prison.
Really?
Yeah, but when I got out,
people were willing to forgive me.
Everybody deserves a second chance.
Thanks.
You know, I'm gonna go, uh, help Julie with the food.
So you guys just keep talking and bowling.
Talk and bowl.
Bowl and talk.
Here, let me show you something.
See the arrows right in the middle?
Just roll it straight over the one in the center. Okay.
You don't have to spin it or anything.
Just right down the middle.
Look at that!
Good job.
Hurry up!
I am hurrying up, okay?
Wait, no! No! No!
What?
I dropped the keys.
I don't have 'em. They're in here!
Sometimes you just have to laugh.
Andrew?
Would you mind turning off your video game?
My lawyer would like to have a little chat with you.
So even though your mother did witness George Williams' suicide,
there's no affirmative duty to intervene.
Therefore, no crime was committed.
Even if the police find out,
your mom will never see the inside of a courtroom.
Well, maybe I got the story wrong.
What if she went over there to help him commit suicide?
If you wanna lie to the police, go right ahead.
But please know that I will sue you.
For what?
Abuse of process.
It's when a person tries to exploit the legal system
for an improper purpose like blackmail.
You guys can't sue me. I'm just a kid.
Oh, don't worry.
I won't start garnishing your wages until you turn 18.
Your mom is she a peach or what?
If the cops don't give a damn, I'm sure your friends will.
How does a little public humiliation sound?
Bree, can I get a refill on this?
What are you doing?!
Your father was a friend of mine.
And if he were around to see what a nasty little turd
you've turned into, he'd knock the hell out of you.
Yeah, well, he's not here now, is he?
No, he isn't, but if you don't get your act together
and start treating your mother with some respect,
I'll take care of you myself.
Do you understand what I'm saying?
Yeah.
Good.
Hey, neighbor.
Oh, hey, Carlos.
Hi.
I just wanted to thank you for patching things up with Gaby.
Well, sure, no problem.
It's been really tough on her-
everybody finding out about the affair.
Yeah, I can imagine.
I don't mind telling you, it's, uh...
it's been pretty tough on us the past couple months.
Oh, well, I'm not surprised,
and I really, really hope you can work it out.
Yeah, we're trying. You know...
Mm-hmm? Yeah?
Gaby had an interesting suggestion.
Oh?
She told me that I should go out
and have an affair of my own.
She thinks it's the only way
I'll be able to get over what she did to me
and that it just might help our marriage.
Why are you telling me this?
Uh...
I guess I just, uh...
wanted to know if you had any thoughts on the subject?
I... don't.
I really don't.
Well, if you ever do, let me know.
By the way...
Mm-hmm?
That was one hell of a kiss you gave me.
You can't fake chemistry like that.
What the hell is this?
Delfino!
Stay away from my son!
Oh, my God!
Dad!
You okay?
I'm fine.
Aah!
So I squirm to avoid hitting his car
and I hit the parked car instead
and that's when the trunk popped open and...
when we got out
we found this dead body.
Are you worried now?
'Cause I am.
Not yet.
Let's be patient, see what happens.
How'd it go?
Well, I told them everything I know,
which wasn't much.
So, we thinking this is Paul?
Well, he's our friendly neighborhood murderer.
Yes, it seems obvious.
I don't know.
I saw his face when he looked into the trunk
and he looked just as shocked as I was.
I'm thinking it's the Applewhites.
I talked to the dead guy.
He said he was doing appraisal on their house.
I got a little cheesed
so I called every realtor in town.
Nobody had even heard of him.
That doesn't mean Betty knew him.
Please.
Those two were fishy.
They bought that house, site unseen...
And they did move in in the middle of the night.
And there were noises.
What noises?
A couple weeks ago
I heard some noises coming
from the basement like a clanging.
I asked Betty about it.
She lied right to my face.
What's that about?
I dont know.
Now I'm worried.
Julie.
Hi.
Well, my dad found out about us bowling.
I cannot be able to do that anytime soon.
Oh, sorry.
No, no, I'm glad we did.
I haven't felt like a part of a family in a long time.
Thanks.
I'd better go back inside.
The act itself never varies,
but each kiss carries with it a meaning all its own.
It can convey a husband's eternal devotion...
or a wife's enormous regret.
It can symbolize a mother's growing concern...
or a lover's growing passion.
But whatever it's meaning,
each kiss...
reflects a basic human need.
The need to connect to another human being.
This desire is so strong,
it's always amazing when some people...
dont understand it.
Previously on "Desperate Housewives":
I'm gonna die,
and I'd like to know what happened
to my daughter before I do.
When it comes to Wisteria Lane,
there are old crimes...
new crimes...
As soon as it gets dark, we get rid
of that body.
...and crimes that are happening...
right under everyone's nose.
I'm thinking it's the Applewhites.
Jim Halverson was aware
that he had little to offer a woman.
He was neither rich, nor smart, nor handsome.
Are you Jim? I'm Susan Mayer.
So when his friend set him up on a blind date
with a beautiful stranger...
Wow, you're so much hotter than Nikki said you'd be.
How old are you?
How old do you think I am?
...Jim made the tragic decision to try to be funny.
Not a day over 50.
Why don't we get our table?
Well, no, see, that was funny,
because you're so obviously not 50.
That's why I said 50, 'cause it's absurd.
Jim did everything he could to get
Susan Mayer to laugh.
He tried racial humor...
So guess what time chinese people
go to the dentist?
2:30.
Uh, get it? "Tooth-hurty"?
Tooth-hurty.
I love that.
He tried to be engagingly risqu..
Rectum? Damn near killed him!
You know what a rectum is, right?
He even tried gentle teasing.
No, no, you see, by comparing you to a nazi,
I was making the point
that you're so not a nazi.
You're like the-
And just when Jim
thought the date couldn't get any worse...
...it did.
Okay, Jim, I need you to look up...
...and down.
All right, so, how did this happen?
It was an accident.
Oh, I don't know about that.
In some cultures head-butting is
a mating ritual.
Dr. McCready, can I talk to you
about my head?
Away from... the draft?
You can call me Dr. Ron. Everyone does.
Dr. Ron...
I need you to pretend there's something
wrong with me and admit me for the night.
I'm sorry?
This is the worst date
I have ever been on in my life.
That man is the most obnoxious,
offensive, annoying human being.
And you're looking at me like
I'm crazy right now,
but I will be if I spend
one more second with him.
So you gotta help me.
You gotta do something.
It's my mental health. My mental health!
You took an oath.
Could you let go of my lapel, please?
Oh, sorry.
Um, listen, I'm sorry
your date's not going well.
But I can't admit you, Susan.
Right. Right.
Jim, let's, uh, let's take a look at
those reflexes.
Okay, I got a joke for you, doctor.
What's the correct medical term
for the circumcision of a rabbit?
Hare cut.
I don't I always-
Jim, I'm gonna need to keep you here
for awhile, run some tests.
Really? I-
Yeah, I'm still worried about
that bump on your head here.
That's still...
And, Susan,
you're good to go.
And though it only lasted a moment,
Jim caught the look that passed
between his date...
and his doctor.
Thank you so much, Dr. Ron.
And he suddenly got the feeling
the joke was on him.
2x12:
We're Gonna Be All Right
The annual blood drive was
a tradition on Wisteria Lane.
Most residents came to help
promote health and well-being,
but my friends turned up
for a different reason.
They were growing
increasingly concerned
that their street was infected
with a dangerous kind of sickness.
And they came to consult
with one another about a possible cure.
Great, she caught me staring.
Have you guys noticed
how friendly Betty's been
since that body was found
in front of her house?
I don't trust
friendly women.
That's okay.
They don't trust you, either.
I just know those two have
something to do with that dead body.
Do we even know who he is?
Well, the paper said the police
are withholding the details.
Bree, maybe you should call in a favor
from your police detective pal,
have him poke around.
That's a great idea.
You could have him do a background
check on the Applewhites.
I don't think
I can do that.
Why not?
You said he was nice.
Well, once he stopped suspecting me of
murdering Rex he was delightful, but, um...
I don't really know him.
Well, somebody has to do something,
'cause I'm losing sleep.
Betty! Matthew.
Hello, everybody.
Susan, a little birdie told me
you're having a birthday soon.
We should all go out
and celebrate.
Super.
Sounds like a plan.
Count me in.
Bye.
See ya.
So why are you everybody's
best friend all of a sudden?
If there was ever
a time to be neighborly,
this is it.
We're idiots for staying here.
I mean, we should've hit the road
as soon as they found Monroe's body.
I mean, how do we know he didn't tell
Foster where we're hiding?
Because if he had,
Foster would've shown up by now.
And besides, if we take off,
what are we gonna live on?
I have all of our money
tied up in this house.
So why not just sell it?
Patience, Matthew.
If we take off right away,
it'll look suspicious.
Now what we need
is a story-
a reason for us to move.
Look at this, AB negative.
Yeah, it's the rarest
of all blood types.
Well, there must be something
in the water around these parts.
You're my second
AB negative today.
Seriously?
Uh, who was it?
That guy.
Hi, Bree.
Oh, hi.
I just wanted to thank you
for your advice on my azaleas.
They're just thriving.
Oh, it was no trouble at all.
Such a shame I may not
be around to enjoy them.
Well, my mother has taken ill.
And Matthew and I,
we'll probably go and visit her.
We may even be moving.
We just don't know yet.
Oh, well, where does she live?
Oh, back in Chicago.
Is it serious?
I I don't know yet.
Well, obviously, I'll be
speaking with her doctor.
Oh, Betty, if there's anything I can do,
anything at all...
Thank you.
You've already done so much.
Bye.
That Dr. Ron called.
He needs to see you
for a follow-up appointment.
He needs to see me
or he wants to see me?
Jeez, mom, how cute is this guy?
Oh, he could be cuter...
but I don't know how.
So ask him out.
Oh, no,
I can't do that.
Mom, he's a cute surgeon.
What's the problem?
He's young.
Young?
Younger than me.
How much younger?
Let's just say if I was
a senior in high school,
I'd be saying, "Wow,
you're a hot fifth grader. "
Oh, well, of course it's gonna sound
gross if you say it that way.
But you're both adults.
So why not just ask him out?
'Cause the conversation
could go something like this:
"Dr. Ron, I think you're hot. "
"Oh, well, thank you, ma'am. "
"Now I think it's time we talk
about your hip replacement. "
Mom, you're hot and... funny and nice.
And... clearly desperate,
and guys are into that.
Play to your strengths.
Thank God you're home.
What's wrong? Pat said you told
her it was an emergency!
The boys were sent home from school.
What? Why? I called.
The machine kept picking up.
I know. I know. Look, I...
They've got chicken pox.
Chicken pox? That's the emergency?
They're totally contagious.
Not to us.
They are to me! I've never had it.
Well, you never told me that.
You know, the point is, I can't go in there.
It's a hot zone.
Well, Tom, somebody's gotta
take care of our kids.
Exactly.
And since you're immune-
Oh, you've gotta be kidding!
I have to get back to work!
Just for a couple of days,
until they're not contagious.
It is not the Ebola virus. It's chicken pox.
You are being a baby.
Yes, I am.
Okay.
And if you think I'm being a baby now,
do I need to remind you of
what I'm like when I'm sick?
Remember that time I had strep throat?
We wound up in marriage counseling.
I'll call the office.
Thanks, honey.
Uh, Mrs. Solis, I gotta talk to you.
Ralph, if this is about Luis
overwatering the hydrangeas again,
I told you,
no one likes a tattle tale.
My wife left me.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't know you and Bonita
were having problems.
We weren't.
Uh, it was all of a sudden.
She just packed her bags and left.
She said I have an illness,
and I need to get help.
Why?
There's nothing wrong with me. I just
like to look at pretty ladies on the internet.
And sure, they're not always dressed,
and sometimes, there's more than one.
But I only go to the classy websites.
There's some really sick stuff out there,
Mrs. Solis.
Ralph!
Make your point.
Um, last night, uh, I found this new website.
And there was a picture of a lady
sitting on a bearskin rug
with nothing on except for a little
pointy elf hat. It was very festive.
Uh, Ralph, why are you telling me this?
I'm sorry. It's just, um...
Ahem... I think you really need to see this.
Oh, my God!
The lighting looks great on you, Mrs. Solis.
I mean, most of the time, you have to squint
at the screen to see anything really good.
And not here, no, sir, that's good.
Well, um, thank you, Ralph,
for bringing this to my attention.
Uh, Mrs. Solis, I was wondering...
would you sign that for me?
Oh, okay.
Where have you been?
Why didn't you come to see me?
I came every Sunday.
You were just too out of it
to know I was here.
I think you're lying.
But then again, these days,
I think everyone's been lying to me.
The thing is, you're here now.
So tell me what I wanna know.
Did you find the man who killed my daughter?
It was a guy named Todd Forrest-
this lowlife drug dealer.
He got her hooked again.
She tried to steal from him, and he killed her.
And I killed him.
I thought hearing that would make you happy.
I thought it would, too.
But it doesn't.
I'm sorry.
I wanna start your I.V., but your
veins are kinda bad.
Well, here, let me help you.
What the hell are you doing?
You're crazy!
You're fired. Get out.
So I guess we're done then?
Yeah.
You, uh...
you gonna come see me again?
You planning on having an open casket?
Hey, guys.
Hi, Lynette.
Hi, Carlos.
All right! A reuben? How sweet is that?
Lunch brought right to the golf course.
I hear you got some pretty
sick kids in there.
Oh, it's just chicken pox.
But braveheart here will only come
in to sleep and shower.
I can't say I blame him.
I wouldn't want to be shooting blanks either.
Be well, my man,
Bye, Lynette.
See you later.
I'm sorry, what did he mean, "shooting blanks"?
Oh, it's nothing.
There's just a small chance
of sterility if a grown man gets
chicken pox, so...
We're not having any more kids.
Why would it matter?
I don't know. You know, survival instinct?
So that if you're the last man to
survive a nuclear holocaust,
you could repopulate the planet?
No, all I'm saying is that,
God forbid, something were to
happen to either one of us,
I'd want either one of us to have, you know, options.
So you're saying that if I died...
you would want a second wife and a family?
Maybe.
I can't believe you've actually
thought about this!
Haven't you?
Thought about who I'd marry if you died?
Hmm. No.
Well, honey, it's a back-up plan.
I'm not gonna use it.
Then why have it?
Well, I don't know, because...
it's like, there's this door, right?
And I'm not planning on
actually going through it
because I'm so happy in the room
that I'm in.
But in case of fire or flood,
it's comforting to know that
the door is unlocked.
Honey, I'm not through with that!
Yeah, well, why don't you have your
second wife make you lunch, okay? Oops!
You...
Bree, uh,
I have to say, I was, uh,
I was very pleased to get your call.
I mean, I'm surprised you'd want
to have anything to do with me
given our recent history.
Oh, you mean your having suspected me
of murdering my husband?
Detective, that is all
water under the bridge now.
I am very glad to hear you say that.
Although, I have to confess,
I do have an ulterior motive.
I need to ask you a favor.
Oh, well, shoot, whatever I can do.
We have these, um, new neighbors-
the Applewhites.
It's a mother and her son.
They just moved here from Chicago.
And they seem very nice.
But there's-
there's something about them that's...
off.
They're...
odd.
Odd?
Yeah, they're secretive and watchful.
And there was a dead body found
in front of their house.
I can't run a background check
on your neighbors for being odd.
Is that why you wanted to see me? To-
to ask me that?
Yeah, why?
Well, I just during the investigation,
I just thought there was a kind of a, um...
spark between us.
You know, I thought this might be a date.
Uh, no.
I just wanted to ask you a favor.
Fine, no harm done.
When do I ever get to have lunch
with such a lovely lady anyway?
Date or...
no date.
Are you sure that you can't
check on the Applewhites?
I mean, I just know
that there's something there.
And, you know, I have a sixth sense
about people.
And yet, you got engaged to the man
who murdered your husband.
Well, your blood pressure looks fine.
You're free to go, Mrs. Mayer.
You mean, I'm not gonna see Dr. Ron?
Well, I do the follow-up exams.
Dr. Ron only comes in if there's a problem.
Oh, well, maybe I should go ahead
and see him anyway,
just to be safe.
I'm sorry.
Dr. Ron's schedule is very tight today.
So unless you're having a serious problem...?
You're experiencing nausea,
chills and tingling, huh?
Yeah,
but now that I think about it,
I bet it's just all the coffee I drink.
I drink way too much coffee.
Do you like to drink coffee?
Uh, no. No.
So the tingling is in your fingers
and your toes?
I should switch to juice.
I know the best juice place.
You would love it. Do you drink juice?
Susan, how often have you been having
these involuntary muscle spasms?
Oh, oh, not that often.
I probably just need a good massage.
Susan?
Yeah?
I wanna get you in for an M.R.I.
No, I don't think that's necessary.
Are you a doctor?
I got high marks in math and science.
I wanna get you in for an M.R.I.
No, no, no. I think, given the misunderstanding,
that I should get the bill.
I won't hear of it.
All right,
we'll split it.
Fair enough.
You know what?
Let me, uh, let me give you a ride home.
Detective Barton, is this some sort of
high school ploy to get me back to your place?
I just don't think you should be
driving a car. You've been drinking.
I had two glasses of wine.
Three, plus the tawny port with dessert.
It's all here on the bill
if you wanna take a look.
You know what?
I politely rejected you,
and now you're getting your revenge
by embarrassing me.
You've had too much to drink.
Give me your keys.
I am not giving you anything.
Except the bill.
What do you think you're doing?
I followed you to make sure you were okay.
You were weaving.
Please step out of the car.
Oh, you can't be serious.
Out.
Detective, I am not drunk,
and I am not stupid.
I know exactly what this is all about.
I'm gonna need you to take a sobriety test.
A sobriety test?
I'm not taking any sobriety...
test.
This behavior stems from the hurt feelings
of a man with very low self-esteem.
The world is a big place,
and I'm sure there is a woman
out there somewhere who'll respond to your
macho posturing.
Well...
here's hoping.
Baby, what you're about to see
will most likely shock and upset you.
Okay.
Remember Scott, the photographer
I was dating when we met?
The one I dumped for you,
who never really got over it
and who I always said
was gonna get back at me?
Oh, Carlos, I love you so much.
Move.
What is this?
Scott's website,
with pictures of me on it.
Well, say something.
Oh, my God.
It was supposed to be funny-
a naughty little christmas gift
for my boyfriend.
Oh, my God!
I know, I was freakishly flexible back then.
I'm sorry!
Look, what are we gonna do about this?
I guess I'll call my lawyers.
I gave these pictures to him as a gift.
He owns them.
Then I guess we're screwed.
Not necessarily.
See, here's what I'm thinking-
Scott's a coward,
so you could totally put the scare into him.
All you gotta do is go and rough him up,
and he'll take my pictures off
the website like that.
I'm sorry, but this is your mistake.
You're gonna have to fix it yourself.
And I would love to,
but I have the upper body strength
of a kitten.
I need a brute!
Gaby,
I am just now starting
to get my rage issues under control.
This brute doesn't swing that way anymore,
so go find another.
Well, when you left prison,
did they leave you a contact list?
So, is Dr. Ron gonna be here for this?
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Uh, there's a hook on the wall there,
so go ahead and get your stuff hung up
and, uh, just get comfy. Dr. Ron should
be here pretty soon.
Okay. Okay.
Is she trying to put on the dust cover?
Yep.
How long are we gonna let this go on?
Just a few more minutes.
Hi, uh, Susan?
It's Dr. Ron.
You don't have to get undressed for this.
Oh, uh, I-I, uh...
Then why did you put out a gown?
No, no, it's not a gown.
It's the dust cover for the M.R.I. machine.
This should take about 45 minutes.
Now I know it's really cramped and
uncomfortable in there,
but try not to move.
Susan, I realize that this whole process
must be troubling for you.
Yeah, it's pretty troubling.
Well, we're gonna get to the bottom of this.
And I'll be here for you, okay?
Hey, Dr. Ron?
I just have a feeling
that everything's gonna turn out fine.
And when it does...
I'd like to buy you dinner
to celebrate my health.
You know, I was thinking, maybe Italian?
Oh, what the heck,
maybe we can call it a date.
If you like.
Dr. Ron?
Uh, he left a while ago.
He got a phone call from his girlfriend.
Okay.
Thank you.
I'd like to get out now.
Try not to move.
Good morning, Luis, Ralph.
Good morning, Mrs. Solis.
Good morning, Mrs. Solis.
Good morning, honey.
Hey, you're talking to me again.
Well, I thought about what you said-
about the pictures and you're right.
It was my mistake
and I have to live with it.
What the hell are you doing?!
I'm living with it!
Hey, turn around and keep gardening!
Aw, you're so mean.
Put your clothes on right now.
Why? You either care
if men leer at me or not.
And you made it clear that you don't.
So what's the point?
Gabrielle, I am not beating
this guy up for you!
Then you better think of another way to
get my pictures back.
Because if you don't, people on Wisteria Lane
are gonna be seeing a lot more of me!
Ralph, Luis, feast your eyes!
My finger!
I'll find it!
Aah, my finger!
It's gotta be here somewhere.
I'll look for it, man.
Don't worry, man.
I'll find it.
My finger!
Hey, honey,
good news.
I checked on Penny,
and she didn't scream.
I think she's getting used to the mask.
I don't want you to have options, Tom.
If I die, I wanna hear your life would be over.
I want you to spend the rest of
your life screaming,
"It should've been me on that plane!"
Plane?
I'm assuming there was a crash.
It could've been something else.
Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Do you have any idea
how painful it is to hear about you
even think about your next wife and kids?
I could never do that!
I can't imagine my life without you.
You are my everything!
Honey, you're my everything.
Okay, well, that's easy to say,
but I need you to show me.
How?
With a vasectomy.
Can't I just get you some flowers?
Look, it makes perfect sense.
We're not gonna have any more kids.
And the pill just makes me bloat.
It'll be great!
No, okay, Lynette,
this is crazy.
Oh, I know! I know!
But it is what married people do.
They go out of their way to calm
each other's irrational fears.
Oh, come on, Tom.
I really need you to do this.
Well, okay.
Fine, yeah.
I'll make an appointment.
Thank you.
Can I ask you somethin'?
I'd rather you didn't.
How'd you get started?
Started?
You know,
in the escort business?
I beg your pardon?
I bet the guys go crazy with
your whole...
classy, repressed thing
you got going on, huh?
I mean, your skin has, like,
no pores.
I am not sure, but I think there
was a compliment in there somewhere,
so thank you.
But I am not an escort.
How much you charge a night?
Look, I'm...
5,000.
What do you have to do exactly for 5 grand?
All right.
Your bail cleared. You're free to go.
Your car's at the impound lot.
And you can pick it up in the morning.
Well, how am I supposed to get home?
I don't have any money.
Call a friend.
I have been through enough humiliation
for one day.
I hope you have a better suggestion than that.
Okay, well, let me think, um...
Walk.
Oh, for goodness sakes!
Bree?
Is everything okay?
Oh, oh, I'm fine. I just, um, had a flat tire.
It's your lucky day.
I'm a whiz at changing tires. Hop in.
You know, thank you,
but I think it's actually something
more mechanical.
My car has been making just a terrible noise.
Well, I have auto club.
Come on.
Actually,
my car has been impounded by the police.
Thanks, Betty, and, um...
I'd appreciate it if you could keep
this little incident to yourself.
I won't say a word. I swear.
Well, that's good to hear,
because most people on this street
couldn't keep a secret
if their lives depended on it.
Well, Bree,
even if everyone does find out,
it's no big deal.
I mean, lots of people have D.U.I.'s.
Yes, but the difference is most of those people
were actually drunk when they were arrested.
I was not.
Well, of course.
You know, you sound like
you don't believe me.
Well, um, it's just...
I know you've gone through a lot lately...
the death of your husband,
problems with your son.
It would only be natural if you
did self-medicate.
I'm sorry, but since when do you know
so much about my personal life?
Bree,
it's like you said-
people on this street are not
great at keeping secrets.
Except for you.
You're really good at it.
I beg your pardon?
Well, you moved into your house
in the middle of the night.
God knows what you moved in
that you didn't want anybody to see.
People hear sounds coming
at all hours from there.
And, oh, what was the last one? Oh, right-
they found a dead body in front of your home.
Everybody talks about the Applewhites,
but nobody can figure out
exactly what you people are hiding.
So, congratulations.
Your secrets are safe...
for now.
Edie?
Hi, it's Betty Applewhite.
Yeah, I'm sorry to call you so late but, um...
I really need to meet with
you first thing in the morning.
Yes.
Well, I've decided to sell my house.
Dr. Ron?
What are you doing here?
Uh, we need to talk.
And it's not the kind of talk
we can have over the phone.
Oh, are you sure?
Um, because I would look a lot better
over the phone right now.
Um, Susan, your, uh, your test results came back.
And for the life of me, I can't figure it out.
Now based on the on the symptoms
you were describing-
Symptoms?
Yeah, the dizziness, the tingling,
the muscle spasms,
the chills it could be neurological.
It also could be based on an
autoimmune disorder.
I just frankly, I'm stumped.
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Hey, listen, we're gonna get through this, okay?
I am so sorry.
But I'm not sick.
What are you talking about?
Your nurse wouldn't let me see you, and I...
really wanted to see you,
so I sort of faked all my symptoms.
The dizziness, the chills, you know,
all of it.
Why-why would you do something like that?
What the hell is wrong with you?
I know. I know. I feel really awful.
I am just not the best at meeting men.
And I thought you were cute,
and I sort of thought that maybe
you thought I was cute,
and you're a doctor, and that's so sexy.
So I was up all night worried sick,
digging through medical books,
trying to figure out some mysterious disease
that doesn't really exist?
Really? You were up all night?
Yes.
I don't enjoy telling people
I think they're going to die.
Especially not people I like.
You like me?
Yes.
What about your girlfriend?
What girlfriend?
The one who called in the M.R.I. room?
We had one date. She wanted a
referral to a dermatologist.
She's got eczema.
Maybe we could go out sometime?
Do you like sushi?
I love sushi.
I'm available tomorrow night.
No, no, no, tomorrow's no good.
I'll still be angry.
I should be cooled down by Friday.
Oh, uh, Friday's good.
Oh, there's one thing-
your M.R.I. showed that you
have a wandering spleen.
A what?
It's a wandering spleen.
It's no big deal.
Sometimes the thing just
moves around in there.
But we'll keep an eye on it.
Wandering what?
Okay, go get him, tiger.
I can't do it, Gaby.
What?
I can't go in there.
I thought I could, but I can't.
You promised!
Ever since I got out of prison,
I've been trying to lead a better life.
And for the first time, I can honestly say
that I'm a good catholic,
and I don't want to ruin that.
So do this today and go to an
extra long mass tomorrow.
It doesn't work that way.
Okay, look, I'm really trying
to understand your moral dilemma here. I am.
But if you don't get my pictures back,
I'm gonna be humiliated.
You think our gardener
is the only local perv surfing the web?
I'm sorry, Gabrielle.
You used to go crazy
when men would so much as
look at me the wrong way.
And that's when I had clothes on.
I'm trying to be better than that now.
Or maybe you just don't love me
as much as you used to.
Why can't you just let me be a good person?
You know, if you really loved me,
you wouldn't even ask me to go in there.
If you really loved me,
I wouldn't have to ask!
Fine, forget it.
Really?
Be a good person.
Knock yourself out.
It's not that I don't love you. I-
Yeah, okay. Look, let's just go home.
What are you doing?
I'm getting your pictures back.
I'm not gonna hurt him.
I'll talk to him,
appeal to his better nature.
Can I help you?
I'm Carlos Solis.
You have, uh, naked pictures of
my wife on your website.
You're, uh...
Gabrielle's husband?
Well, you know what?
I was just about to take those off anyway.
That's great.
I really appreciate this, Scott.
Hey, no problem.
To tell you the truth, Gabrielle's pages
weren't exactly raking in the big bucks for me.
I find that hard to believe.
I'm not saying Gabrielle's not a pretty girl.
Of course she is. But, uh,
she ain't exactly internet pretty, you know?
What does that mean?
The web's about fantasy, not fashion.
I mean, guys surfing for porn,
they don't care how the clothes are
hanging off the body.
They just wanna see the goods. So, uh,
if little Miss Nasty ain't rocking
some curves...
My wife has a perfect figure.
Don't get me wrong.
Our little Gaby knows how to, uh...
work a runway, but, uh,
when it comes to cyber lovin'?
No real man's gonna waste tissue on that.
There you go.
That's all of 'em.
So, we cool now?
Now that's my guy.
You're not limping.
Did everything go okay?
I couldn't do it.
What happened?
I don't know.
I got there, I...
I put on the paper gown and I, uh...
I just couldn't do it.
Why not?
It felt like I was being emasculated.
Oh, please.
I'm serious, Lynette.
I don't make the money around here anymore.
I don't provide for you and the kids.
And I wasn't going to let them snip out
the last thing that makes me a man.
Staying home and taking care of the kids
doesn't make you less of a man.
That's crazy.
You expect me to calm your irrational fears,
I expect you to calm mine.
Are you saying you're unhappy?
A little bit, yeah.
Well, what are we gonna do about that?
I don't know.
Can't we just...?
No, Lynette.
I don't know.
Hi, it's detective Barton. Look, I feel awful
about what happend the other day.
I was a jerk.
So, to make it up to you
I did some sniffing around about the dead man
they found in front of your neighbour's house.
I've got some information.
His name was Curtis Monroe,
a private detective who lost his license
a couple years ago.
Apparently he is from Chicago.
I I don't know if any of this is helpful but...
...years ago, he is apparently from Chicago.
I I don't know if any of this is helpful but...
I just feel terrible about what happened...
Illnesses can take on many forms.
Those of the body are easy to treat.
Much more difficult
are the hidden maladies that fester in our hearts,
the secret addictions that consume our souls,
and the diseases we deny
which affect our judgement.
To survive, we need to find that special
someone who can heal us.
I worked so hard all my life,
so hard.
Now it's all nothing.
I got one daughter I hate
and who hates me...
...and one dead before her time.
No one left for me now.
Uh, what did I do it for?
It was good.
I didn't feel a thing.
I have enough pain.
I don't need any more.
But we can never predict
who'll have the cure for what ails us...
The other nurses all warned me
you were difficult, Mr. Taylor.
...or when they'll show up.
But I think we can get along just fine.
Previously on "Desperate Housewives":
If you try to come between me
and my husband, I will take you down.
Bring it on.
Gabrielle threatened a nun.
You're good to go.
Susan hit on her doctor.
So, you came to ask me out?
'Cause I'll say yes.
And Bree's daughter let her intentions be known.
It's amazing how far we're willing to go...
Andrew, give me one good reason why I shouldn't call the police.
Because I'm your son.
...all in the name of love.
If there is one thing Edie Britt understood,
it was the nature of war.
After two failed marriages and countless rocky romances
she had learned that love was a battlefield,
and the easiest way to survive the carnage was total surrender.
You know, I was thinking a vacation to Rome will be so romantic.
Vegas is cheaper.
Oh.
Could you put your underwear in the hamper?
Can you do it? Youre standing right there.
I've got a hankering for Chinese food tonight.
I'm so over rice. Let's do pizza.
But the day comes for every soldier
when she must take a stand...
What do you think you're doing?
...and fight.
It's time for my game.
I want to watch my movie.
Edie, this is important to me.
Fine. I have stuff to do anyway.
You see, when it came to men,
Edie had a battle plan all her own.
You got five minutes for Edie?
Wow, that's some knot you tied.
Yeah? Well, it's no fun if it's not tight.
You know what would be hot?
Whipped cream.
Oh, you are so bad.
Oh, you have no idea.
Yes, Edie Britt understood the nature of war.
Edie, it's been ten minutes!
Where's the damn whipped cream?!
She also knew that to the victor...
Edie! Edie!
...go the spoils.
2x13:
There's Something About A War
The guest bedroom on the second floor of the Applewhite house had the best view in all of Wisteria Lane.
From its windows, one could see from Mike Delfino's house
on one end of the street
all the way to the old Huber place on the other.
But unfortunately for the room's newest guest,
the view was about to change... dramatically.
What on earth is he doing out?
Caleb, go up to your room.
Mom and I gonna have a talk now.
His room? Have your lost your mind?
Relax, I've taped newspapers to the windows.
People can't see in.
Caleb, get back down here.
No, no! We had a talk. It's fine. He understands
what's gonna happen if he's discovered.
For five seconds he understands
and then he forgets. You know that.
We can protect him without treating him like an animal.
I am keeping him safe from the police,
from the Fosters, from himself.
He is not going back downstairs!
Since when do you talk to me like that?
Since I share the risk.
I have a few announcements.
I'd like to acknowledge Mrs. Herbert
for spearheading the potluck dinner.
Her hard work and tuna melt...
She is adorable, isn't she?
She's okay.
Next Saturday, the woman's ministry will be
holding their annual bake sale from nine a. m. to...
Ours would be gorgeous.
Knock it off.
Knock what off?
Babies, babies, babies.
You sound like a broken record.
I just had a miscarriage.
It's gonna take some time
before I'm ready to get pregnant again.
Any idea when you'll be ready?
You know, ballpark?
Stop it!
Let's just enjoy the here and now.
We're together. Our marriage
is back on track. Life is good.
Before we wrap up, we have a dear friend back from her missionary trip to tell us about her experiences.
Sister Mary Bernard.
Son of a bitch!
Danielle.
Honey, are you in there?
Um, I'm doing homework.
Really? Because I'm holding your backpack
with all your schoolbooks.
Hold on.
Thanks, mom. I was just doing
a little research online.
Oh, while I'm here, I might as well
grab some of your laundry.
No, please not right now.
Honey, stop complaining.
One day you'll wish someone were offering
to do your laundry.
Danielle, question.
Is there a black man hiding under your bed?
What's going on?
I just thought you should know that I came home
to find your son hiding underneath my daughter's bed,
and it just seems to me that-
Inside, right now.
I apologize for my son's behavior.
It won't happen again.
I put the house up for sale and we're moving.
Now, if you'll excuse me.
How's it going?
Oh, not good.
I'm trying to salvage the pitch from
the Black's Frozen Yogurt campaign.
You know what kills me?
Yeah?
Here we are at t-minus nine hours and eleven minutes from the biggest pitch in our company's history
and I have nothing even vaguely presentable.
Ill get the coffee.
Thank you.
Do you wanna go over it
and toss some ideas around?
No, that's okay.
I know you're exhausted.
You should go to bed.
Come on, honey. Let's do this.
Let's nail this sucker.
What do we got?
We've got nothing.
Okay. Okay.
Black's Frozen Yogurt.
Let your taste buds come in from the cold.
Okay, you know whatever. I'm just knocking the rust off.
I can do better than that. I can do better.
Black's the Fro-Yo that makes you go whoa!
Come on. I'm sorry, I just really need to focus here.
Okay, Black's Frozen Yogurt: because our cows are better.
Or, no. Or, or, or Frogurt.
Frogurt, it's fun to eat, fun to say.
That's actually good.
Really?
No, the cow part. That can work.
We'll, we'll make them into characters.
We'll humanize them.
Oh! I know. I know. Celebrity cow spokespeople.
Yes, yes, that's exactly what I was thinking.
You know, like make 'em like famous characters,
like, uh, Reverend Mooo-ny.
What do ya-what do you think of that?
They can't all be gems.
Thank you. I had fabulous time.
Me too.
Well, I guess Id better get going.
Oh, um, Julie's staying at her father's house
and I'm all alone here.
Yeah, sometimes it actually makes me a little nervous.
Turn the TV on. That's what I do.
Oh, that's a good idea.
I forgot. I have a bottle of wine.
It's already chilled right in the refrigerator
and thatll just really relax me.
That's good.
So, um, were still good for Thursday?
Ah, yeah, yeah. Thursday is great.
Good night.
Do I just repulse you?
No. Why?
We've been on three dates and you just
keep acting like a perfect gentleman,
and uh, it's getting a little old.
Susan, make no mistake. I am like inches away
from ripping off your clothes right now.
And youre stopping yourself why?
Well, I'm still your doctor
and it's not quite ethical yet.
Oh, so why are we dating?
Look, it's only temporary. Once you're well,
I'm done treating you, all bets are off.
Okay.
Ah, what the hell.
Okay, that sorta felt unethical.
Thank you for meeting with me.
Sure. Id have invited you to the house
but the place is real pigsty.
Carlos, I'm a nun, not a moron.
I know Gabrielle despises me.
She's just jealous of you, that's all.
Of me? Oh, isn't that silly.
She refuses to believe that I can connect
with anyone on a spiritual level.
We do have an amazing connection.
That's why I wanted to talk to you.
When I saw you at church,
I could tell instantly you're unhappy.
Okay, maybe I've been a little down lately.
Tell me.
This whole having kids thing.
Sister Mary, I just I want them so bad.
Gabrielle still refuses to give them to you?
To be fair, she did have a miscarriage recently.
What if she decides against kids?
What if this is just a stall tactic?
Then I'm screwed.
Sorry. Sorry.
No, you're right.
You're screwed.
Unless...
Unless what?
American Catholics Guide to Annulments.
Sister Mary, what exactly are you saying here?
I'm saying, 'God helps those who help themselves. '
Hey, I got great news.
We just landed the Black's Frozen Yogurt account.
Really! They loved the pitch?
The talking cows rocked their world.
Hey, how did they like my prison Bull Clinton idea?
Ah, well, I rewrote some of the stuff we worked on,
but you know, essentially it's the same
and they ate it up.
That is fantastic.
Yeah, and Ed said we can finally afford
to hire another executive.
Terrific. Tell me, did they like the promotion plan
sponsoring the cow tipping contest?
Ah, well, the pitch was running long,
so we cut a few things.
I'm just glad they loved my idea.
Well, to be fair...
Did they like the Hugh Hefner and the Play cows?
They're calling me in for a meeting. I gotta go.
Love you, bye.
So, this is your spleen.
Normally, it'd be over here, but because you're missing ligament structure,
it has wandered over there right next to your liver.
And we discussed it at the staff meeting.
Everyone thinks you should have it removed immediately.
Oh well, okay.
I mean, I guess you guys probably have all sorts of new
exciting techniques where you don't even cut open the body?
No, not really.
No? So, we're talking surgery?
Well, I guess I can handle that.
People get cut open every day.
So, I'm assuming youre good with me
doing the surgery, right?
You?
I mean, it seems natural. I know the most about
your case. I promise you'll be in very good hands.
Oh, uh, well, uh...
What?
The first time youll see me naked,
Ill be on an operating table.
Oh, I promise I will be a perfect gentleman.
My eyes will be strictly on the spleen.
Doctor, Mrs. Baker is here for her follow-up.
Right.
We need to schedule Susan for a splenectomy with me.
Oh, congratulations!
So, I will call you later?
Oh, I am so happy for him. Such a doll.
I'm curious.
Um, why were you so congratulatory?
Oh, the spleen surgery.
It'll be his first!
Hey, honey.
Can we talk about something?
Sure.
So, I've been thinking about the whole baby thing.
And however long it takes for you to feel ready,
I am fine with.
Okay.
But here's the deal.
I need to know that this isn't a maybe.
I want a promise that we will have children.
I'm sorry. I can't promise that.
Why not?
Because I can't say that I'm gonna wake up tomorrow
and suddenly wanna do something that I swore my entire life
I would never do.
'Maybe' is a very big step for me.
Yeah, well, it isn't big enough for me.
Well, I'm sorry, but you're just gonna have to accept it.
There's nothing else you can do.
That isn't necessarily true.
Excuse me?
You are threatening me with an annulment?
That conniving little bitch put you up to this, didn't she?
Didn't she?
This fight could be over right now
if you'd just make me a promise.
The only promise I am making you
is that this is so not over.
Hi!
Hey.
Hey.
How's the search coming for the new ad exec?
Any luck?
Oh, the pickings are slim.
So far none of my top choices are available.
Hey, um, do you have someone from your old company
that you could, you know, maybe recommend?
Daddy!
Well...
I can't find my toothbrush.
I'll be up in a second, buddy.
Hi.
As a matter of fact, there's this one guy
who would be perfect.
Yeah?
Yep, hard-working, smart as a whip.
Total package.
Really? What's his name?
Tom.
Tom? Tom what?
Tom Scavo.
Oh, no, no!
I do not think that that is a good idea.
Come on, honey.
I mean, the other night doing those pitches,
it just got the old juices flowing.
I remembered how much I miss having a real job.
You have a real job,
right here staying home with the kids.
With two incomes, we could afford a top-notch nanny.
What about Penny?
You're the one who fought for office day care.
Let's use it.
What about the two of us working and living together?
I think that could be a recipe for disaster.
Why? The last time that we worked together,
we fell in love.
Oh, it's just... I'm-I'm not sure
that you would find this job that satisfying.
You don't think I'm good enough, do you?
I'm not saying that.
Daddy, I still can't find my toothbrush!
I'll go.
I got it.
Come on, buddy. Let's hunt it down.
So, who won the fight?
We weren't fighting.
Mommy's just letting daddy know where he stands.
Oh, hey! Hey!
Thanks for coming in, Mr. Gainey.
We'll be in touch.
Thank you. Bye.
What'd you think?
Well, honestly, I wasn't blown away.
I know the pickings are slim,
but we can't hold out much longer.
We need to hire someone this week.
I know! I know! I know.
So, who's up next?
Tom Cavos. You ever heard of him?
Could you excuse me for just a minute?
Sure.
Tom Cavos?
Yeah, it's an anagram.
It's deceptively simple, don't you think?
What do you think you're doing?
I'm going over your head.
I mean, you might not think I'm good enough,
but maybe Ed will be a little more open-minded,
since, you know, he's not constantly competing with me.
You want the truth, Tom?
I think you're good. You have moments of brilliance.
But I also think sometimes you coast.
And I think if I were your boss
and had to ride your ass every day,
you would come home seething with resentment.
Come on! It's hard enough keeping a marriage together.
If you're at all concerned about saving our
marriage, you better let me take my shot.
What does that mean?
It means that a little part of me has been hating you
ever since you tanked my promotion at Petersen.
Tom.
But I can let it all go if you'll give me this one thing.
Excuse me. Ed's waiting for you guys.
Great! Great!
Just let my rsum?speak for itself.
Uh, just let your rsum?speak for itself?
Yes.
Okay!
Oh! You worked the Poncer Cheese accounts?
Those angry mouse spots? They were hilarious!
I was on that from the beginning.
'Warning, do not eat the cheese!
The cheese is evil!'
I love that! You've got a great rsum?
Thank you.
Yeah, gosh, it is. It's quite impressive.
Oh wow, I see you worked for Bellfore and Barrasso.
That's a great shop.
Yeah, I put my time in.
Uh-huh, and when were you there?
Because you forgot to list your
dates of employment for that one.
Um, that was a few years back.
Uh-huh. And how long did you stay?
Just about five months, actually.
What, did you get recruited by another firm?
Did somebody cherry-pick ya?
No, I was fired.
Oh.
Yeah, but honestly, I was happy to leave
because they didn't get my sense of humor.
I actually pitched a version of the cheese is evil
there first. They hated it.
Idiots! Well, their loss, right?
Yep.
And I see you won a Clio for the Thompson's Salad Dressing spot.
That was very cool.
So, did you do that solo?
Actually, no. My wife helped me on that one.
Um, she's in advertising, too.
But if you were to ask her, I'm sure she'd tell you
she did the whole thing all by herself.
Credit hog, huh? I know the type.
You know what, Tom? I like you.
Ed.
And I'm not usually one for hiring in the room.
No, no, no, no, no, we never hire in the room.
But we're in a time crunch, and we need someone now.
I think you're the guy.
Lynette, you got any issues?
Well, um... let me just call in a few references
before we make anything official.
Sure! Sure!
We'll be in touch, okay?
'The cheese is evil!' Oh, god, I love that.
Oh, um, I'm looking for Father Crowley.
Do you know where he is?
Um, he's in the confessional.
How long has it been since your last confession?
Who cares? Father, it's me.
Gabrielle?
Yeah.
Look, I need you to do something for me.
I need you to get rid of Sister Mary Bernard.
What? Why?
Because she's ruining my marriage.
Sister Mary?
Yes.
At first it started with the love letters while
he was in prison, and the next thing I know,
they're spending day and night together,
sneaking off to private bible study,
and-and one-on-one spiritual consultation.
Gabrielle-
And if that wasn't enough,
he is saying her name in his sleep.
Hold me, Sister Mary, hold me. ?
It's disgusting. He's like a lovesick puppy.
Do you have reason to believe that your husband
and Sister Mary are... having sex?
Speak from the heart, Gabrielle.
This is just between me, you, and God.
Yeah. Yep. They're having sex.
Carlos confessed everything right
before he asked for an annulment.
Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.
How long since your last confession?
Mm, not that long ago.
Look, I sorta told a fib,
so how many Hail Marys?is that gonna set me back?
Go away.
Oh, honey, what happened wasn't my fault.
There's no way I could've predicted
how Betty would react.
Oh, please! You knew something bad would happen.
You wanted all this to blow up in my face.
Oh, honey, why would I want that?
Because you're jealous that my life's
just getting started and yours is over.
Danielle, that's ridiculous, sweetheart.
Daddy's dead.
You drove your boyfriend to suicide.
You're getting older by the minute,
and soon you'll be so dried up and bitter that
no man will ever want to touch you ever again.
Danielle!
I know you're determined to ruin my life,
so I have to stay with you here and keep you company
while you turn into an old fossil.
All I ever wanted was for you to be happy.
Don't just want it. Make it happen.
Danielle, I don't feel much like cooking tonight.
I'm thinking of ordering a pizza.
I want Canadian bacon. Please.
All right.
He's mad at you 'cause you hit him.
Well, I feel bad about that.
But when I consider the risks he was taking...
It's a shame he can't see that girl.
She's so pretty.
What did you say about Danielle?
I said that she-
You know I don't want you thinking about things like that.
I'm sorry. I didn't. I'm sorry.
It's okay. It's okay.
Go on and run up to your room.
Read the comics I got you.
And, Caleb?
If I ever catch you looking at that Van De Kamp girl,
I'll hit you twice as hard as I hit your brother,
and I won't feel bad about it. Okay?
Okay.
So, this whole splenectomy thing,
you feel good about it, huh?
Yeah, yeah, I told you.
It's a routine surgery.
You're gonna be fine.
Right, right.
Actually, I sort of meant, um...
...do you personally feel confident?
What do you mean?
Well, you know, you're gonna be...
...hacking into me, and I just wanted
to make sure that you feel ready.
I've never taken out a spleen before.
But believe me, it's no big deal.
Spleen, gallbladder, it's all the same.
Okay, red flag! See, I didn't go to medical school,
but I'm thinking not all the same.
Susan, I know what I'm doing.
You're gonna have to trust me. Okay?
I would like to. But I gotta be honest,
the fact that you can't even cut that steak isn't helping.
That's not fair. You overcooked it,
and, frankly, it's not the freshest meat.
Well, neither am I.
I've got thirty-five years on that cow.
Wait, Susan, are you saying
you don't want me to be your surgeon?
I'm sorry.
I don't mean this to sound the wrong way. I just...
I would be more comfortable with an experienced surgeon.
That's okay. I understand.
Thank you.
I should really be going.
What?
I didn't even serve dessert yet.
You said you understood!
No, I do, I do.
I respect your decision to see another doctor,
but you know what?
You need to respect that my feelings are hurt.
What? You want me to put my life on the line
to service your ego?
I save lives every day.
I cut. I save. I cut. I save.
That's what I do, and if that gives me an out-of-control ego,
well, maybe I need that to cut into another human being.
Hey.
Hey.
Dinner's ready.
So did you call around?
Check on my references?
I told Ed you were my husband,
and he was cool with that.
He really wants to hire you.
So, who am I to stand in the way?
Really? So I got the job?
On one condition.
If you take this job,
you are never allowed to bring up
what happened before with your promotion.
That's it? Deal.
No, it's not a deal. I need a solemn vow
that you will never throw that in my face ever again.
Because if you do, you will unleash demons
that you do not wanna meet.
I get it.
And what I really need from you...
...is to be forgiven.
Actually, I already had.
This dinner is really good.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Hi, Betty.
Hello.
I wanted to talk to you about what happened
the other day with the kids.
I told you, we will be moving soon.
There's nothing to worry about.
Well, my fear is that if we keep them apart,
they'll try that much harder to be together.
I mean, you know how teenagers can be, and...
well, a lot can happen in a couple of weeks.
I'll make a deal with you.
If you control yours, I will control mine.
How about some old-fashioned chaperoning?
That way they can, um, still see each other,
and we won't have to be the villains.
When it comes to my son's best interests,
I'm not afraid of being the villain.
I assumed that you would feel the same way, Bree.
Now that you mention it, I guess I do.
I have to go.
I have some, um, muffins in the oven.
Mom, what's wrong?
It's the Applewhites. I don't want you to go near them.
What?!
Do you remember the man they arrested?
The one that broke into Gabrielle's
and escaped from the mental hospital?
He's there. I saw him in their window.
They're hiding him.
You're kidding.
No, I'm not. And I forbid you to go over there.
Lynette, hi, it's Bree. Uh, listen...
call me when you get this message,
and please come to poker tonight.
I have some big news about the Applewhites.
All right. Bye.
Who was that?
Sister Mary.
They just transferred her to a parish in Fairbanks, Alaska.
You're kidding me. Why?
She doesn't know.
The diocese wouldn't even give her a reason.
Ah, Vatican politics.
What's wrong?
I think I'm just coming down with a migraine.
Oh, well, maybe you should go lie down.
I'm gonna be out for a while.
All right.
I'll see you there.
Susan? What are you doing here?
We need to talk.
Okay, all right, but, look, I just got out of surgery-
I've been waiting for three hours.
After you stormed out the other night,
I started to doubt myself.
I started to think,
'Gee, you know, maybe I should just ignore my better
instincts, and I should let Dr. Ron gut me like a fish. '
Susan.
I mean, why not?
'Cause all my life I have jumped through hoops
to keep men from leaving.
But I'm not doing it anymore.
So, tough luck, pally.
You just missed out on a good thing.
Susan! You've been here for three hours?
Yeah.
Well, two hours ago, flowers, champagne, and
an apology note were delivered to your doorstep.
Really?
Look, I put our relationship at risk, all right?
And it was stupid.
I haven't felt this way about somebody in a long time.
Susan, I really like you.
And because of that, I...
I can't be your doctor, let alone your surgeon.
I mean, there's a pretty good reason
why they make those rules.
Listen, I hope you forgive me, all right?
Because I'll hate myself if I lose you.
Wow. I wouldn't want you to hate yourself.
No.
And I am so sorry about that... snap thing.
I was just trying to be theatrical.
I got your note. What's going on?
Are you hiding someone in your house?
What?
My mom saw someone in your second story window.
She thinks it's the guy who broke into Mrs. Solis'.
Damn it, Caleb.
Is that his name?
Has she told anybody else?
She left messages on her friends' machines.
They're coming over soon to get details.
We're gonna have to leave tonight. This is-
Why? What's going on?
I would love to tell you, believe me, I would.
But I can't.
If you trust me, I could help you.
My family has secrets, too.
What my brother did... it's bad.
Last year my brother did something really awful,
and my parents covered it up for him.
If anyone were to ever find out,
Andrew and my mom could go to jail.
So you don't have to worry about me judging you.
Tell me your secrets. I'll understand.
Okay.
But you tell me yours first.
What are you doing here?
I heard you're being transferred,
so I came to say good-bye.
Come to gloat is more like it.
No, we've had our differences,
but that doesn't mean I'm happy
to see you shipped off to Alaska.
Brrr.
You had something to do with this, didn't you?
Me? Oh, I'm just a humble sinner.
You're the one with all the power around here,
all the... annulment mojo.
Is that why you did it?
Well, getting rid of me isn't gonna change anything.
Carlos will do what he wants.
The problems in your marriage aren't going away.
Maybe not...
...but you certainly are.
You missed a spot.
That was a mistake.
There. I think we're all done here.
Oh, my god! Oh, my god! Hold on!
Are you okay?
Stop fighting now!
Stop fighting! Ladies! No!
What the hell were you thinking?
Uh, depends. What have you heard?
I got a call from the church.
They said you attacked Sister Mary!
Yeah, that's about right.
What are you thinking?
I wasn't, but I was thinking about it on the way over here.
And I realized the ass I should be kicking is yours.
Mine?
Yes!
Sister Mary manipulated you into threatening me,
but you're the idiot that fell for it.
I was not threatening you.
I was asking for a promise.
You made me a promise, Carlos, a long time ago:
till death do us part.
And one day you just come home and start
throwing words around like annulment.
How do you think that makes me feel?
Okay, I'm sorry about that.
I need to have a child.
And I need to know I'm the woman
you want to spend the rest of your life with,
not just some uterus in high heels.
Gabrielle, please.
No, Carlos, I am sorry.
I am not gonna be blackmailed into giving birth.
You have to choose.
And I wish you would do it
so I can move on with my life.
Well, of course I choose you.
I think that's the right decision.
You know, I made a decision, too.
The answer to your question earlier is yes.
Yes...?
I wanna have a baby.
I wanna have a baby with you.
Betty. What a surprise.
Can I talk to you for a moment?
Uh, now is actually not a good time for me.
I think it is. I wanted to chat with you
before you did something foolish.
I don't know what you mean.
The person you saw at my house today...
...is my other son. His name is Caleb.
He didn't harm Gabrielle, and he didn't hurt
the man in the car trunk. That's all you need to know.
He's your son?
He's my dear son who happens to be slow.
Sometimes he makes mistakes.
But, Betty, the police are looking for him.
He escaped from that facility they sent him to.
He had help, trust me.
I've always thought the maternal instinct
is one of nature's most amazing gifts.
I mean, the length that some mothers will go to to protect their children,
it drives ordinary women to do extraordinary things.
Women like me, Bree, and like you.
What are you talking about?
If you breathe one word of Caleb's existence
to anyone, I will tell Carlos, Gabrielle, and the police
that it was your son driving the car
that killed Juanita Solis
and that you have been covering up his crime ever since.
We're gonna be great friends, Bree.
We have so much in common.
So is that all she said?
Yeah, something about the Applewhites.
I'm dying of curiosity.
It's rude to keep people waiting.
Hi. Come on in.
So, spill it.
What's the scoop on the Applewhites?
Um, about that, um...
Oh, Bree, come on, dish already!
Well, perhaps I got more excited than I should have,
but I recently found out
that Betty Applewhite is quite the poker player,
and so, I have, uh, invited her to join our weekly game.
Hello, everybody. I hope you brought
your checkbooks because I am feeling lucky.
Everyone understands the nature of war.
I raise.
We also understand that victory depends on the cards
that we have been dealt.
Some, when faced with a bloody battle,
simply give in.
But for some, surrender is unacceptable.
Well, Bree, what are you gonna do?
Even though they know it will be a fight...
I'll raise you.
...to the death.
Previously on "Desperate Housewives":
Your spleen has wandered close to your heart.
We're gonna take it out.
Get your insurance figured out by then, hmm?
There was the bad news...
It's a cop I want you to talk to.
His name is Solomon.
The file on Noah's daughter.
The discomforting news...
Thanks.
Are you hiding someone in your house?
Tell me your secret, I'll understand.
OK.
And the news no one should know...
But you tell me yours first.
Once a month, the crme de la crme of Fairview society
would attend a semi-formal luncheon at the home of Maxine Bennett.
Everyone loved these elegant get-togethers.
Everyone that is,
but a certain red-headed housewife who is convinced Maxine was a liar.
You see, Maxine liked to brag that she did all her own cooking
and because each course was served promptly,
...presented with flare,...
and was positively mouth-watering,
Bree knew Maxine had had some help.
And sadly for Maxine...
Bree intended to prove it.
Maxine, once again, this entire lunch is just out of this world.
I just have to get the number of your caterer.
What a nice compliment.
No, I'm afraid this is all my doing.
This was a triumph, an absolute triumph.
Oh, come on, do you honestly expect us to believe
that you had the time to prepare a six-course meal for ten women?
Even I couldn't make this and have time to get ready for a party.
Well, perhaps you're just not as organized as I am.
If you'll excuse me.
Bree, what's gotten into you?
I have the same recipe for English plum pudding.
It takes six hours to prepare.
How would you have time to make all of this and everything else that we ate today?
This is not the pudding of an honest woman.
FBI, open up!
What on earth...?
We're looking for a Maxine Bennett.
I'm Maxine.
We have a warrant to search the premises, ma'am.
A warrant? I'm in the middle of a luncheon!
Over here.
Found her.
Maxine Bennett, you are under arrest,
for involuntary servitude.
Is this the woman who locked you up?
Bree, what's going on?
Well, I'm not sure, but I think Maxine had a slave.
I can't believe it, I just can't believe it.
But Bree could.
You see, for her...
...the proof was in the pudding.
2x14:
Silly People
The world is filled with unlikely friendships.
Odd pairings that to the casual observer
make absolutely no sense at all.
But if we look closer,
we can see why these alliances formed.
After all, a shared purpose can give
even mortal enemies common ground.
Bree?
We have a question for you.
Oh, what is it?
Well, we were just wondering, actually, we were curious about... uh...
What the hell is going on with you and Betty Applewhite?
Yeah, that.
Excuse me?
Well, from the day that dead body showed up,
nobody was yelling "oh, the Applewhites are involved" other than you.
And the next thing we know, you are having Betty over for poker?
What gives?
She makes it sound like we are angry, we are not angry.
I'm a little angry.
Can we talk about this later? I have ice-cream in here.
Bree, could this flip-flop have something to do with
the fact that Danielle is dating Matthew?
Yeah, that would get her.
Who told you that?
Mrs. McClusky. She saw them making out in the park.
Edie!
What?
Can't you sugar-coat it a little?
I did. He had his hand down her shirt.
Bree, we know that you have a good reason for wanting Betty to hang out with us.
We just wondered if you could clue us in a little.
When it comes to Betty Applewhite, I know what I'm doing.
You two are just gonna have to trust me
and if you can't do that,
then perhaps I've over-estimated the depth of our friendship.
Now, if you'll excuse me.
What a bitch.
Edie, can you-
I was sugar-coating it.
Oh, hey... none of that in here.
Come on, maybe if we remind them I'm shacking up with a senior VP,
they'll stop killing all my pitches.
You've only been here for a week.
Why don't you give yourself a break?
Honey, you know the ad game,
we got to serve amount of time
before mockery kicks me into the curb.
Look, I'm just asking you...
jump in every once in a while, throw me some rope.
You know when Ed's on the war path.
I can't protect you! You're gonna have to find
a way to click with Ed yourself.
And then the pig, he rubs his stomach, and he goes...
'Farm Fresh Bacon? I'll make a piggy out of you, too'
So...
the pig actually eats the bacon?
Uhuh, yeah.
I don't see the client doing a happy dance over the whole cannibalism theme.
Well, Tom, why don't you pitch them the other idea
you came up with last night?
You know, the one where people love bacon so much that they wanna keep it a secret?
What, like a secret underground society of bacon eaters?
Well, like my college fraternity were,
you know, everybody wanted in, but we only take the coolest guys.
You were Greek?
Alpha Tau Mega.
I was Phi Kappa.
You?
And I don't remember you happened to be that cool to play JTO.
Look, if I had a nickle for every fi-cap
that I tag 'naked' to a free way sign.
Scavo, if you were my pledge, I'd make you my bitch.
Oh, you think so?
You know what, I'm liking this whole fraternity angle.
Yeah, you know, let's talk about it over lunch.
You're buying.
Go.
Hello, what's going on?
Gabrielle, I want you to meet someone.
This is Xiao Mei.
She's the young lady who's forced to work for Maxine Bennett.
Oh, the slave.
Wow.
Looks well-fed.
The church is making arrangements for her to return to China.
But until then, she needs a place to stay.
So I offered her our guest room.
Really?
Baby, can I talk to you for a second?
Are you nuts?
It's only for a couple of days.
Oh, this time, you are quickly becoming Father Crowley's go-to guy for charity cases.
And that's a bad thing?
When he turns our house into a catholic underground guest house, yes!
You know who you are, Gabby?
You are the kind of person who'd turn away Mary and Joseph from the inn.
Well, they should've called ahead.
Don't brush your hair at the table.
Are you talking to me?
Does this mean you've finally forgiven me?
Why should I? You've betrayed this family and you're not even sorry.
Don't be such a drama queen.
If the Applewhites go to the police
and tell them that your brother ran over Mrs. Solis,
he could go to prison.
How can you not understand that?
They won't talk about Andrew as long as you don't go to the police about Caleb.
What did this Caleb do exactly?
And why on earth are they hiding him?
Why don't you go to Mrs. Applewhite
and tell her you really need to know what's going on?
I bet if you were really nice, she'd tell you the truth.
Is that what you really think, Danielle?
I should go to Mrs. Applewhite,
be nice and then she'll hand over all her secrets?
Yeah.
When I was young, my stepmother told me that I was very lucky.
I possessed beauty, wit, cunning and insight.
These four weapons all women needed to survive in the world.
So?
So take good care of your looks, Danielle.
You don't have any other weapons at your disposal.
Hi.
I need an operation on my spleen,
and I just found out that I ran out of medical insurance.
Is there anyone I can sue?
After the embezzlement Launy let the policy lapse.
Now he's in jail, and I'm gonna die.
Susie, you are not gonna die.
I'll get into it with the insurance company.
No, there isn't time for you to deal with the red tape.
My spleen is going careening into my heart.
I need that operation now.
I'd loan you the money myself.
But Edie and I just plopped down our savings since ski condo.
I don't need a loan.
I need coverage.
I mean, what if there are complications?
I don't have a safety net.
Please...
What in the hell are you doing?
I'm saying a little prayer.
Uh, for puke's sake.
What? I'm desperate here, do you have any other ideas?
As a matter of fact, I do.
What you need is a husband.
What?
The only way to get a good health plan
is to marry into one.
Edie, come on.
No, no, I think she's onto something.
Yeah, if we find the guy with the right plan,
you could have a sham wedding on a Monday night, and be
fully covered Tuesday morning.
I can't believe you are actually considering this.
The surgeon is slicing me open a week from tomorrow,
what other choice do I have?
All we have to do is to find a guy who's willing to marry you.
You know, come to think of it,
a little prayer might not be such a bad idea after all.
Pat, we are all here, so send the call in as soon as you get it.
200 bucks says you can't do that three times in a row.
You catch three of those,
200 bucks.
What do you say there, Scavo?
You're on.
Here we go.
Ah-ah-ah-ah!
Thrown by me.
I'm sorry, I thought we were here to talk about the farm fresh rollout?
They gotta be catchable, big guy.
You just let me worry about the shooting.
Come on.
That's one.
Guys...
Oh!
Nice moves.
One more, big guy.
Guys, please... that's all right.
Ow!
Oh!
Ow.
That wasn't even catchable!
Yeah, well, maybe not.
But it's totally worth the 200 bucks. Ahh!
Whoo!
Well, you got me.
You're a regular little monkey man!
Oh, I love this guy.
Oh. Hi.
Do you have to sit around all day?
I mean, shouldn't you be out experiencing western civilization
while you have the chance?
What are you doing?
I fix.
No, this is couture!
This rip has to be fixed by an experienced tailor.
You can't just...
Holy crap! This stitching is perfect!
Hungry?
Did you make all of this?
Oh!
For me? Okay.
Oh, my god!
You like?
I like a lot.
You like that?
Yeah, that's nice.
Do you know what they do to people in China
who speak out against the government?
They put them in forced labor camps.
Isn't that awful?
Mm-hmm.
You know what I mean? It's such a repressive regime.
We forget how good we have it.
Yes, we do.
Don't you think Xiao Mei would like it better here in America?
I mean, where she could learn about freedom and democracy and stuff?
Does this have anything to do with you making Xiao Mei do housework?
What?
I just came from downstairs and found her waxing the floor.
She told me you asked her to put on two coats.
Well, first of all, that was her idea.
Second of all, I can't have this conversation until you've tasted her crab puffs.
Oh...
She just got done being a slave.
I mean, she wants to go back to China...
and we can't force her to stay here and be our maid.
Well, who's forcing her? We'll pay her whatever she wants.
And the best part is, with her rsum...
any wage will look good.
No way, baby. Mnh-mnh.
What?
What, so you don't get what you want, you just walk off and pout?
Oh, this isn't about me.
This is about our great nation.
And I have no intention of sexually satisfying a man who isn't willing to stand up for
and help spread the ideals and values of the United States of America.
Sometimes she is a little hard to stomach, but she means well.
Well, that's-
Hi! Oh, here she is.
I came as soon as I got your message.
Is this...?
This is Gary Grantham, your future ex-husband.
Wow, nice to meet you.
Hi.
Okay, listen, um, I've got to meet a client. I've got to go,
so just talk amongst yourselves, and
you two make a very handsome couple.
Oh. Yeah.
Uh, hi.
Hi.
So do you wanna get married on Wednesday?
'Cause Thursday and Friday I'm out of town.
Oh! Oh, yeah. Sure, that's Wednesday's great.
I'm-I'm just curious...
how did Edie convince you to do this so quickly?
Well, she explained your situation to me.
I'm sort of in need of a fake bride myself, so I figured,
what the heck?
Why would you need a fake bride?
Uh, I'm gay, and I've never come out to my mother.
Really?
Yeah.
At first, I just didn't want to upset her.
Then she got older, she got emphysema and diverticulitis,
and I started thinking, if I just kept my mouth shut,
then one day nature would take its course
and we could avoid what is sure to be a very ugly scene.
So what changed?
She told me at her 81st birthday party last month,
the only reason she's hanging on is to see me get married.
Oh. Oh, so by marrying me...
Yeah, I'd get my inheritance that much sooner.
No, but mostly, I wanna make sure she's happy.
Well, you seem very nice, Susan.
Uh, it will be a pleasure being married to you.
Uh, likewise.
Here, finish the rest of the fries.
Here's your mail
and your pills.
Ugh.
More pills?
Miss Tillman?
Hmm?
Where did this come from?
I don't know. It was in with your other mail.
Get me the phone.
Sullivan, it's me.
I just got some news, and I need to get you involved.
Looks like Delfino's been holding out on me.
The next morning, Bree came up with a plan
to get to the truth she so desperately needed.
As she watched the Applewhites leave their house,
she thought of how much she had trusted the previous owners
and how much they...
had trusted her.
Caleb? Is that you?
Hi.
I'm Bree. I live down the street.
I'm a friend of your mother's.
She's not home.
I know. Um...
I came to see you.
Me?
Yes.
Your mother told me all about you and I thought it-
it might be nice if, um,
we had a little visit.
I brought you some homemade cobbler.
Oh, la, la, la, la, la
Right here. Follow the doughnut, people.
Here we go. We got some people. Come on, come on.
What's going on?
Well, um, Ed bet Tom that he wouldn't eat
a doughnut out of the toilet.
Isn't it disgusting?
Unh-unh!
It's gotta be fully dunked.
Now, I don't want the glaze to repel the water.
Whoa, slight delay, people. I'm requesting a scrub down.
Does anybody know where they keep the toilet brush?
Just for one second.
Hey, I never thought I'd have to ask you this,
but are you about to eat a doughnut out of the toilet?
Yeah!
For the Galveston jewellers account.
I don't care!
You're not gonna do this!
Look, Lynette, you're the one who told me
to find a way to click with Ed.
Well, now we've got our thing,
and it's paying off for me!
That's because Ed gets off on humiliating you.
Please, don't do this!
We're waiting, Scavo!
This is my moment.
So, Caleb, besides your mother and brother,
does anybody else know that you're here?
No.
You're pretty.
Thank you. That's very sweet.
So, where have you been living this whole time? Upstairs?
No.
I just moved upstairs.
My room's downstairs.
Downstairs?
In the basement.
You wanna see it?
Caleb, have you been down here all these months?
Yeah.
Did your mother make you wear those?
Most of the time.
Oh, my god!
Sweetheart, I don't understand.
Why in the world would your mother treat you that way?
I hurt a girl.
A girl?
Yeah.
And then she died.
Oh.
Her name was Melanie.
She was pretty.
Just like you.
Hi.
I thought you should know I'm getting married.
To the doctor?
No! No. Ha!
No, to-to a gay guy.
How did you know about the doctor?
People talk. So you-
you're marrying a gay guy?
I need health insurance,
um, 'cause I've got this wandering spleen and...
that sounds funny, "spleen wandering", but...
actually, it's not funny 'cause it can bang into things...
so I need health insurance, so I'm getting married tomorrow.
And you probably think I'm crazy, right?
Well... can it wait?
Um, the surgery?
No.
It can't wait.
I guess it's really not that crazy.
How you doin', ma'am?
Susan, can you just give me a minute?
Oh, yeah. No, I'm sorry.
I that was really... it.
What do you want?
It's not what I want, Delfino.
It's what Noah Taylor wants.
Where's his grandkid?
You know, let's skip the part where you don't know anything about anything.
Mr. Taylor wants to chat.
What if I say no?
Then I've gotta find the kid myself,
and my guess is, he or she is somewhere around here close.
Your old girlfriend-
she's got a daughter, right?
Maybe I should start by paying her a visit.
Her daughter's not the one.
Yeah, well, given your track record,
I might wanna check that out for myself.
Tell him I'll be there in the morning.
Oh!
So pretty.
You like nice things?
That's why I think you're stupid,
for not wanting to stay here.
You could be around my nice things all the time,
taking care of them...
How fun would that be?
Well, I'm sure it's a lot more fun than you'd have in that
tiny, godforsaken village of yours.
You know, we're probably more alike than people would guess.
I'm from a small town, too.
My folks had nothing.
That's why I love America.
Anything is possible.
Oh...
Hmm, you like that?
No.
An old, fat stockbroker gave this to me.
It's not worth anything. You can have it.
Oh...
Oh!
It's okay. Glad you like it.
You can brush my hair.
Oh!
Hi.
Hi.
Uh, this is the best I could do on such short notice.
Okay.
Okay.
Oh, uh, Susan, this is, uh, my best man, Steven.
He's also my life partner.
Oh, hi. It's nice to meet you.
Baby, be-be nice. Come on.
I'm sorry you have cancer.
Cancer?
Isn't that the point of this whole charade?
Gary said you needed insurance.
Oh, yes. No, no, I do need insurance.
I just don't have cancer. I have a...
wandering spleen.
I said it was like cancer.
Is there a problem?
No. No, everything's fine.
Uh, let's just go to the chapel.
Shall we?
I made a wedding cake.
I hope you enjoy it.
Oh! Uh...
So... are we ready to get started?
Oh, do you have a thing to play music?
I had Steven burn a little wedding mix for us.
For ambience.
Sure, just, um, give me a sec.
Do you have a problem?
You said she was sick.
She is.
She has a wandering spleen.
It sounds nothing like cancer. It doesn't even sound real.
Well, it is. I-I could die.
You look fine to me, honey.
Don't do this.
I have asked you six times to fly with me to Holland to get married,
and you always have some lame excuse.
But the second some chick with a silly disease comes along,
well, you drop everything and head for a chapel.
Oh, no, it's a serious illness.
See, it just sounds silly cause of the word "spleen. "
What do you want from me?
I want you to worry about my feelings half as much as you worry about your mother's!
What is it gonna take to make you happy?
Not go through with the wedding?
Is that what you're asking?
Oh, oh! No, no, stop right there.
Okay, I would love to see you two crazy kids get hitched in Holland more than anyone,
with the tulips and the clogs, in front of a windmill, the whole shebang.
But unless I get this surgery,
my spleen is going to slam straight into my heart and explode.
So, you know, seeing as I am just a nice person
and I always support gay rights, let's just do this.
And then I'll have a husband and insurance.
Nobody gets hurt.
Steven, why... Steven!
It's just...
Yeah.
I'm so sorry.
My hands are tied.
I'm really sorry.
Steven, wait. Steven... where are you going?
Ah, finally got the sound system working.
Where's the groom?
Hey, Susie Q.
What's wrong? For a newlywed, you don't have much spring in your step.
I didn't get married.
Really?
We got to the altar, but the whole fake wedding thing sort of imploded.
Wow. I'm sorry.
I still don't have insurance.
I need to get that operation. I'm...
I'm really screwed.
Well...
Why don't I just marry you?
What?
I've got a fantastic health plan.
You'd be covered instantly.
But... we were actually married.
Look, Susie, I've always felt awful
about walking out on you the way I did.
And I figure, if we do this,
I'd basically be saving your life.
I figure I owe you one.
Karl...
So what do you say?
Will you marry me, Susan Mayer?
Again?
What the hell?
Cool!
What are we gonna do about Edie?
We can't tell her.
She'd kill us both.
Yeah, it'll be our little secret.
We've really enjoyed having you as a guest. Right, Gabby?
Absolutely.
Xiao Mei, you are a very special girl, so...
so you take care, okay?
Oh!
Thanks for all your help, Carlos.
My pleasure, father.
Bye-bye. Ladies?
Please don't tell me you're crying
just because you can't have the maid you want.
Carlos, she wouldn't have been just a maid.
She would have been the best damn maid ever.
God, you're pathetic.
Shut up.
Hey,
something's going on.
Is there a problem?
Well, Xiao Mei doesn't want to go back to China.
She wants to stay here and work for you.
What? Why?
She says Mrs. Solis treated her with more kindness than she's ever known.
She now thinks of you two as family.
Oh, really?
Oh, of course you can stay!
Oh!
Gabby...
Carlos, she thinks of us as family.
I'm ready to hear those farm fresh concepts.
Conference room in five, toilet boy!
You are so not allowed to complain to me.
I know. You were right, okay?
So now I'm known throughout the advertising world as "toilet boy. "
Tell him you're done with the games.
You don't wanna play anymore.
No, no, no, I can't. I can't.
If I back down now, he'll see it as a sign of weakness. Look,
this is the way that guys do business.
But-
So, you called it.
He made me his bitch.
Come on.
Here you go.
You know, Ed, I've been thinking.
We've had a lot of fun and games around here lately,
but maybe it's time to set a slightly
more professional tone in the office.
Oh, I get it.
Somebody went running to mommy, didn't he, huh?
What?
Tom loses a few bets,
so he tries to get his wife to make me back off?
Oh, this is so Alpha Tau.
I am gonna make him pay.
No. No, you're not gonna make him pay.
You are gonna stop this now.
This is my company.
If people wanna work here, they play by my rules.
Ed!
What?
I'm calling you out.
Huh? Yes, you're right.
This is your company, so I'll play by your rules.
What do I have to do to get you to stop this frat boy crap?
Shave my eyebrows? Come to work naked?
Name your stakes.
I don't have time for this.
Aw, what's wrong, Ed?
You afraid a Phi Kappa's gonna get beaten by a girl?
Come on, big man...
It's just a little bet.
As you know, I think that making the workplace fun is good for morale.
But Lynette here thinks that our shenanigans have gotten a little out of hand.
Oh, hold on. Hold on.
I respect Lynette's work ethic.
So we've decided to settle the matter
with a little test of intestinal fortitude.
If she can eat
1 pound of our client's fine, farm-fresh pork product,
raw...
there'll be a moratorium on wagering in the office.
Oh, oh!
I know you are doing this for me.
You don't need to do this.
I don't need you fighting my fights.
I am not fighting your fights.
This is my fight.
This is how guys do business, right?
While we're young.
No shame in defeat, Lynette.
No shame at all.
Oh, she's gonna do it.
Ohh!
Oh, yes!
Oh!
Oh, this is too much.
Ooh!
What?
She took the bet.
What? This is fun, people.
She's got one more.
So...
can this be a place of business again, Ed?
No more games?
Sure.
You sucked all the fun out of it anyway.
That was really something.
Thanks.
Could you scrounge me up a bucket?
Caleb said a nice, red-haired lady came to visit him.
Come on in, Betty.
Get you a drink?
This is not a social call, Bree!
Did you or did you not break into my home and talk to my son?
Caleb and I had, uh, a very lovely chat. Yes.
If you ever come near him again,
there will be hell to pay. Do you understand?
Aren't you gonna ask me what we talked about?
The name, um...
Melanie Foster came up.
I'm gonna pour you a drink now, Betty,
because we're about to have a very honest discussion,
and I think you're gonna need a little help getting through it.
His name's Zach Young.
He lives with his father.
Mother committed suicide about a year ago.
How did he end up with these people?
How do you think?
Deirdre was strung out, Noah. She gave him up.
I wanna see this boy.
Well, he's got a new family now.
I can't just snap my fingers and get him in here.
Maybe not, but I can snap my fingers,
and Detective Sullivan can make it happen.
You don't wanna do that.
No?
Is that really the way you wanna meet him-
have that thug drag him in here so grandpa can give him a hug?
Fine. You bring him. I'll give you two days.
As you know, I'm on a bit of a clock here.
When Caleb was born,
and the doctors discovered that he was different,
I didn't even cry.
It was the most painful moment of my life.
I didn't shed a single tear.
I just thought to myself, what's the point?
He is my son,
and I have to raise him
as best I can.
Now that's my job.
In a lot of ways, I feel so blessed.
Caleb is challenged,
but he has such a sweet nature.
I'm sure you noticed that when you came to visit.
Yes, I did.
I also noticed that you had him chained in the basement.
That's because of Melanie Foster.
Melanie was a girl that Matthew dated.
She was a debutante.
And like typical teenagers,
their relationship was full of drama.
They were always breaking up and getting back together and breaking up.
One night, after one of their big blow-ups,
Caleb somehow convinced Melanie to meet him
down at our local lumberyard.
I can only imagine that she thought he was bringing some kind of apology from Matthew
but he wasn't.
Caleb told Melanie
he was in love with her,
and that if he was her boyfriend,
he would never break up with her...
and she laughed in his face.
He tried to show her he was serious by kissing her...
and she hit him.
He doesn't remember a lot of what happened after that, but he-
he does know that he got very, very angry, and...
and that there was an ax lying on the ground nearby him.
Yes,
my Caleb killed Melanie,
but I couldn't let him go to jail...
or worse, be put down,
for what was really my crime.
Your crime?
It was my responsibility.
I was supposed to protect him from himself.
I am his mother.
That was my job.
The world is filled with unlikely friendships.
How do they begin?
With one person desperately in need,
and another willing to lend a helping hand.
When such kindness is offered...
we're finally able to see the worth of those we had previously written off.
And before we know it...
a bond has formed,
regardless of whether others can understand it.
Yes, unlikely friendships start up every day.
No one understands this...
more than the lonely.
In fact,
it's what they count on.
Previously on "Desperate Housewives":
Why don't I just marry you?
I've got
a fantastic health plan.
You'd be covered instantly.
Susan got an offer
she couldn't afford to refuse.
You've had too much to drink.
Give me your keys.
Bree rejected
a helping hand.
I want to have a baby
with you.
Gaby gave Carlos the answer
he'd been waiting for.
You're my second AB negative
today.
Oh, who is it?
That guy.
And Zach began to put
"a" and "b" together.
Susan Mayer had always believed
the punishment
should fit the crime.
She first
came to this conclusion
when she discovered
her husband Karl
had been unfaithful.
Since Karl had destroyed
the love she had given him...
Susan felt
it was only appropriate
she destroyed the things
he loved in return...
one by one.
But now, three years
after their divorce,
Susan was reunited with Karl
once again...
Susan,
are you listening to me?
... as partners
in a crime of their own.
This is insurance fraud.
We could both go to jail.
Now we can't tell anyone
we're getting married.
I know.
I was listening to you.
Now the prenup's all set.
You can sign it
at the courthouse.
11:30, Wednesday morning, right?
Right. And your surgery's
still on for Thursday?
Yep.
Good. The insurance kicks in the minute we say "I do. "
You're set to go.
I know no one's asking me,
but I think this whole thing
is a tragic mistake,
and I just don't have it in me
to survive another ugly divorce.
Don't worry, honey.
This time, it is strictly a business arrangement.
It better be,
'cause if I see so much
as one lingering gaze
between the two of you,
I swear I'll go
to the insurance company
and turn you in.
So we shouldn't expect
a wedding gift, huh?
Oh, can you grab me
your wedding ring?
I wanna get it cleaned
before the ceremony.
Uh... is that
really necessary?
I mean, do we have to do
the whole ring thing?
Of course we do.
It's gotta look believable.
Yeah, okay.
Well, I'll just grab something
out of my jewelry box.
Susan, that ring
was my grandmother's.
One day it's gonna be Julie's.
Where is it?
I don't know...
exactly.
That was a family heirloom.
I trusted you with it.
Well, I trusted you not to
cheat on me and break my heart.
Oh, my god. Oh, my god.
What-what did you do with it?
I threw it out my car window
somewhere on route 7.
What?! When?
The night you abandoned me.
Suz-
Karl, you are so not allowed
to get angry.
I mean, I might've been the one
to throw away the wedding ring,
but you threw away
the whole marriage.
There was plenty of bad behavior
that went on back then,
so just get off
your high horse.
We're on the same page now,
so we should
just focus on that.
Yes, Susan Mayer
believed the punishment
should fit the crime.
Karl, I think
there might be snakes in here.
We're not leaving here
until you find that ring.
But for that matter,
so did Karl.
2x15:
Thank You So much
It was a tradition
at Leonardo's bar and grill:
An hour before closing time,
a waiter would sing a selection
of ridiculously depressing
Italian arias.
It was also a tradition
that the only customers
who would actually listen
were the ones already depressed
to begin with.
Tony?
Do you have to rush off?
I thought maybe we could
just chat for a minute.
So, I haven't seen you
in a while.
Well, I didn't wanna come here
because I was afraid
it would drudge up memories
of my husband.
You know,
this was our place.
Rex passed away recently.
He was, um, murdered
by our pharmacist.
I hope you changed
pharmacists.
I didn't have to.
He committed suicide.
Look, you've had
a little too much wine tonight.
How about I call you a cab?
Oh, no, no, no, no.
I'm okay.
Your car would be safe
in our lot,
and you can pick it up
tomorrow. Please.
Well, okay.
Tony?
How many more arias
is he gonna sing?
Five.
Oh. In that case,
why don't you bring me
another bottle
of the Pinot Grigio?
And please hurry.
Bree?
Bree. You okay?
Yes?
Hi. Uh, did you know your mother
is asleep on the lawn?
Oh, wow.
Yeah, well, you don't seem
terribly shocked.
Oh, it's, um...
it's just, mom drinks,
and sometimes she sleeps it off
in the weirdest places.
Can I help you with her?
No. No, it's okay.
I, uh, I know how
to take care of her.
Well, good luck
to you then.
I wanna play chopsticks.
Me too.
You okay?
I'm coming!
Your kids, they have any allergies
I should know about?
Uh, not that I know of. Why?
'Cause I'm watching them.
Tom called,
said you both got pulled
into work for the weekend,
asked me to baby-sit.  Really?
I thought it'd be nice
if I gave 'em back to you alive.
Oh, hey, Mrs. McCluskey.
Hi.
Sorry, I forgot to tell you.
Oh, that's okay. Um...
Would you excuse me just
for a second? I have a... thing.
Sure.
Thanks.
Follow me.
You're part of the thing.
A million teenagers
in this neighborhood,
and you hire McCluskey?
What's the big deal?
Well, for starters,
she's ancient!
Shh!
This is a thin door!
It was not that long ago
that she keeled over
in her front yard. A day with
our kids will finish the job.
Look, it's only for a few hours.
Plus, Parker's on a play date
with the Farrells,
so it's just
the twins and Penny.
Just the twins and Penny?
Okay, that was stupid.
Let me try that another way.
We have to be at work
in one hour.
There's no day care
on the weekends,
so, you cut McCluskey loose,
and we're stuck.
We will find someone-
someone who doesn't remember
what they were doing
the day Lincoln was shot.
Fine.
Let's go break the news.
My wife has something
to tell you.
So here's the deal.
Um, there was
a little miscommunication,
and as it turns out,
we don't need ya.
Okay. Fine.
I'll just go back home.
Okay. Sorry.
By the way,
your husband was right.
It's a thin door.
Carlos,
what are you doing?!
Hello, Gabriela.
Oh.
Hi, mom.
I just told Carlos
I just had to take a shower.
The man next to me on the plane
weighed 300 pounds,
and he sweated all over me.
Ugh, it was so gross.
No, I'm just surprised
you're here.
It's Valentine's day.
Don't you and Mr. hedge fund
have plans?
I know Carlos and I do.
No, I left Charles.
What?
Mm-hmm.
He was worth,
like, $6 million.
Money is not everything, Gabriela.
For some people,
but we're talking
about you now, mother.
You know,
I can't believe this.
I mean, I just went through
a terrible breakup,
and the least you could do
is pretend to care.
Well, of course we feel awful
about it. Don't we, Gabrielle?
Yeah, we're just
sick about it.
Well, don't worry about me.
Mm-hmm. I'll be okay.
In fact, I bought myself
a little gift
to take my mind
off my problems.
Really?
What did you buy?
New boobs!
No peeking, Carlos.
Okay, mom,
put these away!
My plastic surgeon
gave me a great deal.
Aren't they fun?
Bye, Carlos.
What?
I think she's charming.
Okay, you can think
she's charming.
But don't forget for one second
that she is a monster.
Did you get the gum out
from under the diamond?
Mostly.
Morning.
H i!
Happy Valentine's day.
Dr. Ron,
did you spend the night?
Well, uh, yeah, I got
kinda tired after the movie,
so I asked  It's okay. She
knows that you make house calls.
Oh. Um, so listen,
I've got surgeries till 6.
I'll get dressed and I'll pick
you up at about 7.
We have reservations at Chez Naomi.
Great! I'll have a light lunch.
And also, Dr. Cunningham's
schedule opened up,
so if you'd like, we can move up
your surgery to Wednesday.
Oh, I have a wedding that day.
On a Wednesday?
Uh... yeah.
Um, Wednesdays are becoming
very popular with brides.
It's like the new Saturday.
Oh. Okay.
Well...
I'll see ya tonight.
Bye.
Your mother is
a rotten, sneaky person.
Look, I'm not too crazy about
this whole fake marriage thing,
but if you don't have
that operation, you could die.
So don't be so hard
on yourself.
You are a good person.
Thanks, hon.
That really helps.
Okay, now I want you
to go over
and slip this ring
to your father.
And just so you know,
if Edie catches you,
I'm expecting you to swallow it.
How's the hangover?
I do not have a hangover,
Andrew, because I was not drunk.
Then, uh... how about
a little hair of the dog?
It'll perk you right up.
Look, for the record,
I had an allergic reaction
to my antihistamine medication,
so I would appreciate
just a little bit of sympathy.
Why can't you just drink alone
in your room like Tammy's mom?
For god sakes,
it was an honest mistake.
I thought I could have
just a little bit of wine
with dinner,
but, apparently,
my body couldn't handle it.
Fine!
If it makes everybody happy,
I will just suffer
through my sneezing fits
and my hives on my own.
There. Is that better?
So basically
you would rather drink
than to not have allergies?
Hi. Is now a bad time?
I could really use a favour.
She was beautiful,
wasn't she?
Yeah.
Come on, sit down.
Your breakfast is getting cold.
Was my real mother beautiful?
Well, she was, uh,
attractive, as I recall.
Do I look like her?
I don't know.
I I only met her once.
Oh. Well, 'cause if
I don't look like her,
then I might look like
my real dad.
I'm getting real tired
of your morbid fascination
with two strangers who didn't
love you enough to keep you.
So, please,
stop asking about them.
It's only natural that I'd wanna
talk about my birth parents.
Well, it may be natural,
but it certainly isn't polite.
And once your daughter was dead,
they had to get rid
of her somehow.
That's where
the toy chest came in.
Flash forward 15 years,
the chest washes up
on the shore of Rockwater Lake.
any forensic evidence
is long gone,
and the Youngs
get away with murder.
Now, of course,
the wife, Mary Alice,
is already dead, but...
Paul Young's
a different matter.
If you'd like me
to deal with him,
just say the word.
Delfino's bringing
my grandson here.
I wanna
get the kid something.
You know anything
about those MP3 things?
Yeah, they're real nice.
I'd go with that.
Ah, he's probably
got one already.
Paul Young has had 16 years
to get my grandkid
anything he wants.
Do me a favor, will ya?
Yeah.
See to it that Paul Young
has a toy chest of his very own.
Karl!
Yeah?
This place is a freakin' pigsty.
Would you get down here
and help me?
All right, hold on,
it's almost halftime.
By the way,
I made dinner reservations
at Chez Naomi tonight,
if that's okay.
It's gotta be better
than that rathole
you took me to
on New Year's.
And don't even think
of getting me carnations again.
That crap might have flown
for Mayer.
I actually have taste.
Come on! Move it!
All right, I'm coming.
No! No, no, no.
Sit and watch the game.
I was just giving you
a hard time.
You've had a tough week.
Boys...
can you just keep it down
just a little bit?
Because I have a very...
uh, special type
of grown-up headache.
We need to see mommy and daddy.
We wanna play 'em our song.
Honey, you can't.
They're at work.
Well, can we play it for you?
Sure.
Just-just a moment, okay?
All right, boys, let's have it.
When I heard that you two
wanted to try for another child,
I was delighted.
But I had some cause
for concern.
Gabrielle, you suffered
some extensive injuries
during your fall last month,
and the test confirmed
there are complications.
You can't have kids?
Well, the doctor's not
100% positive,
but it's very,
very iffy.
Carlos, I am so sorry.
I know how much
you wanted to be a dad.
Thanks.
Don't be so suicidal.
We can always adopt.
I wanted to have a child
of our own. You know that.
What does it matter
whose DNA it is?
The diapers are still gonna
smell the same regardless.
I'd just prefer
not to adopt. Okay?
Fine. What about surrogacy?
I mean, I know it's pricey,
but at least the baby
would look like us,
and I wouldn't get
stretch marks. It's a win-win.
Great. So then we have
some stranger off the street
giving birth to our child.
Is that what you really want?
What I want
is for you to lighten up.
We don't have a lot of options,
and you're gonna have to pick one.
I-I have a thought.
Well, it's, uh,
a little bit controversial,
but, uh, go with me.
Well, first of all,
let me tell you,
that I am in the best shape
of my life.
So?
So... what if I was
your surrogate?
Yeah, I know. I know
it might sound a little crazy,
but I am the only one
in the world
that you can trust
to put the baby's needs first.
You know, I'll exercise more,
I'll eat better-
Mother, no!
Why?
Off the top of my head,
you're on medicare?
I am only fifty... one.
You know, and there's this woman
in England last year.
She was 63 years old,
and she gave birth
to her own grandchild.
Look, I don't care if she shot
triplets out of her ass.
It's not gonna happen.
Can you believe this?
How'd that
England baby turn out?
I mean, it didn't have, like,
a big head or anything, did it?
Carlos, you are not
seriously considering this.
Well, think about it, Gaby.
This way, the surrogate wouldn't
be some impersonal incubator.
There'd be a family tie.
I have a migraine.
I'm gonna go lay down upstairs.
Then when I get up,
I hope we can all talk about
this like rational human beings.
Carlitos, don't worry.
Just give her time.
She'll come around.
Boys?
Boys?
Okay, we're done playing
hide-and-seek!
Boys?!
Porter! Preston!
This isn't funny!
Mrs. McCluskey, hi.
Have you seen
the Scavo boys?
No, can't say
that I have. Why?
I have something to tell them.
Have they signed
the contract?
'Cause if not,
somebody should call Bednark
and tell them to adjust the language.
Okay, I'll handle it.
Oh, I'm sorry. Hang on.
Hello?
Lynette Scavo?
Yes.
I believe I have something
that belongs to you.
Hi. Excuse me.
Hi. You called and you said my kids are here?
Hi, mommy!
Oh, my god! Oh, my god!
Dad!
Just what were you thinking,
taking off like that?
Honey, I was so worried about you.
Get your stuff.
Get your stuff right over here.
Thank you. Thank you so much.
Stay right here.
I'm just glad I found 'em
and not some weirdo freak.
Oh, yes.
Oh, yeah, me too. Thank you.
Because there are all sorts
of crazy people out there-
drunks, perverts, molesters.
Yes! Yeah, no, I know.
No! You got really lucky.
I mean, a different person might have
called the cops or child welfare.
Well, uh, okay,
I know how this looks,
but I have to tell you,
I left them with
a very reliable baby-sitter.
Oh, yeah.
You picked a real winner.
Are you judging me?
Because if you are,
you couldn't say anything-
Lynette, Lynette!
What?!
Let it go.
The kids walked
for 3 miles to get here.
We don't have a leg to stand on.
Well, thank you so much!
Here we go.
Hey...
I don't know about you,
but I am tired of all
the tension around here,
so I was thinking we could
go shopping, have some fun.
Then maybe later we can talk
about the surrogacy thing,
see if we can
make it work.
Oh, Gabriela!
Oh, you'll see...
this is the best thing
for the entire family.
So, where's the boutique?
Oh, it's in
the hotel lobby.
So go ahead,
I'm right behind ya.
Okay.
What are you doing?
I'm going home.
What?
I thought
we were gonna talk about
how the surrogacy will work.
Here's how it's gonna work:
You're gonna check yourself
into the hotel,
and then tomorrow,
you're gonna plant your
childbearing hips on a plane,
and you're gonna
leave our lives forever.
I'm pulling out.
Watch your boobs.
Come on out.
Oh, thank God! I'm so sorry.
I don't know what happened.
I was in the kitchen cleaning up
after making cookies,
and I looked in the living room,
and they were gone.
We tried to tell her we were
going, but she was asleep.
You were sleeping?
I most certainly was not.
Yes, you were.
Okay, all right, that lie
just lost you another week
of TV and video game privileges.
That's two. You wanna
keep talking and lose more?
Then apologize
to Mrs. van de Kamp.
Sorry.
All right, go back in.
No-no harm done.
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
Well, if you ask me, it's
a pretty crappy thing to do.
Did you even slow the car down
before you pushed her out?
Okay, first of all,
no one asked you.
And the only reason you care
about my mother is because
of that ridiculous suggestion she offered.
I think her offer
... to be our surrogate was very generous.
Generous? Don't you see the strings attached?
What strings?
The only reason
she offered up her dusty womb
is because she's screwed.
Her latest sugar daddy
gave her the boot,
so mom needs a place to stay
and money. So trust me,
if she carried our child, we'd
be footing the bill for years.
I think your hatred for her
is clouding your judgment.
Maybe, but you don't
know her like I do.
Okay.
You ran away from home
15 years ago.
Did you ever think to talk to her
about the stuff that happened
between you and your stepdad?
It wouldn't have done any good.
How do you know that?
Because she knew exactly
what was going on with Alejandro,
and she chose
to look the other way.
But you never even gave her
a chance to step up.
You just ran away from home.
Because if I did,
then she w-
Becau-...
There was a chance
she wouldn't have believed me,
and... and that
would've hurt a lot worse
than anything
he ever did to me.
She's your mother,
and she loves you.
I know it's been a very long time,
but maybe you can
talk to her about it now.
I'm getting her luggage
back to her,
and that's the best I can do.
What are you doing here?
There's something I need
to talk to you about.
It's important.
There's nothing for us to talk about.
Shut up and listen.
Deirdre's father, Noah Taylor,
somehow found out about Zach,
and he wants to meet him.
Somehow found out?
Like, maybe you told him?
Noah is no friend of mine.
But he's very rich and powerful,
and he's terminal,
and he wants to meet
his grandson before he dies.
Absolutely not.
Well, you'll be surprised,
but I agree with you.
Noah destroys
everything he touches,
and the last thing
either of us wants
is for this guy
to get his hooks into Zach.
What are we supposed to do?
You and Zach need to vanish.
Just stay out of sight
until nature
takes its course with Noah.
If we leave,
we won't be coming back.
You'll never see your boy again.
I know.
Well, happy Valentine's day,
my darling.
Isn't that your ex-husband?
Oh, yeah.
Oh, apparently,
they'll let anyone in here.
Hi. Hmm.
Your chocolate souffls
will be out momentarily.
Oh, we didn't order souffl.
I ordered
as soon as we got here.
It takes an hour to prepare.
Oh, I really can't. I'm stuffed.
No, no, no.
This you'll wanna try.
It's their specialty.
I guess I'll have the souffl.
Can you excuse me
for a second?
I, um... I just
have to powder my nose.
I'm sorry to interrupt.
Your makeup is all smudged.
Come with me. I'll fix it.
What?
Come on, get up.
Sorry.
My makeup is smudged?
Get in here.
I have some news that's
probably gonna devastate you.
But I wanted to be
the first one to tell you.
Okay.
Karl is about
to pop the question.
You mean, like, marriage?
Mm-hmm!
Oh, I hope I haven't ruined
your Valentine's day.
Do you want a tissue?
No, no. I'm okay.
I I'm just... surprised.
Uh, well, congratulations.
Um, what makes you think
he's gonna propose?
Well, I, um...
I was looking through
his briefcase this afternoon,
and I found this ring.
And so tonight he keeps pushing
the special dessert on me,
so obviously,
he's hidden the ring inside.
A ring!
What did it look like?
Oh, I don't know.
18-karat white gold,
10 diamonds, engraved accents.
I just got a quick peek.
Oh, um...
I think I know that ring.
That's his grandmother's ring.
It's a family heirloom.
And, you know,
he might just be having it
cleaned or something.
Except for one thing:
Lying right next to it...
was a prenup!
Oh.
Well, Karl is a lawyer,
and it could just be a prenup
for another client.
Boy, jealousy is
one ugly thing up close.
Oh, no, Edie-
No, you know what?
I'm gonna take the high road and...
and I'm gonna ignore your nastiness.
If you'll excuse me,
I'm going back to my table
and getting engaged.
Oh, hi. Um,
do you see that man over there?
Dark hair, handsome.
I need you to slip this to him
without anybody noticing.
God, you never stop.
I told you,
I'm not divorcing my wife.
I'm in this for the sex,
and if you can't accept it,
then go to hell.
What the hell are you doing?
Well, I thought you said
this dessert was special.
When you put it
in your mouth and eat it.
What is wrong with you?
Well...
...nothing.
Carlos, what a surprise.
Come on in.
I thought you could use your bags.
Oh, yes.
A perfect timing.
I just took a shower and needed
something to change into.
Here, leave it here.
This is fine. Thank you.
Listen, do you have a minute?
Um, because I need to talk
to you about something.
Hmm, yeah, sure. Sit down.
Talk as I dress.
I'll leave the door open
so I can hear you.
Look, I was, uh, I was thinking
about your surrogacy idea.
Mm-hmm?
And I think
it could be the answer
to all of our problems.
That is,
if you're still interested.
Yes! I mean, uh, I am.
But I-I just think that
Gaby will never let it happen.
No, no, she can
be convinced. I know it.
Can you please, uh, zip me up?
Huh?
My zipper! It's stuck.
You did that so fast.
I know someone who works out.
As I was saying, I think
the surrogacy idea could work.
Um...
but you and Gaby are gonna
have to mend some fences.
After such a long time,
what is the point?
Lucia, please, hear me out.
There was a lot of stuff
that Gaby went through
when she was younger-
a lot of stuff
that you don't know about.
And I think that if you went
to her and asked her about it,
then the two of you
could finally get past it.
What stuff are you
talking about, Carlos?
Your second husband,
Alejandro?
When Gaby was 15,
he assaulted her sexually.
Is that what she told you?
Look, I know that
it comes as a shock for you
to be hearing it from me-
Carlos, please,
I am aware they had sex.
But it was Gabriela
who seduced him.
Excuse me?
She was always jealous of me.
You don't know how many times
I caught her wearing my shoes,
trying on my jewelry...
and I'd scream at her to leave
my things alone, but no,
she wanted whatever I had.
Then one night,
she set her sights on Alejandro.
Believe me,
no one got raped.
Lucia,
she was only 15 years old.
You know, a lot of men
have left me over the years,
and I never knew the reason.
But when Alejandro left, I knew
exactly why it happened.
Gabriela made him
fall in love with her.
Oh, it took me so many years
to forgive her.
You forgave her?
But of course.
I couldn't have offered
to carry her baby unless I had.
Karl. Karl!
Come here!
Why didn't you answer
your damn cell phone?
I turned it off.
What's going on?
Where's Edie?
She's upstairs.
She's been in a pissy mood ever
since we left the restaurant.
I don't know what's wrong with her.
She found the ring and the prenup
in your briefcase.
She thought you were gonna
pop the question tonight.
Oh, no.
Oh, yes. You know, this whole
fake marriage thing was okay
when nobody was getting hurt.
What are we doing? It's a lie!
I lost Mike over a lie,
and now I'm doing
the same thing to Dr. Ron,
and-and look at Edie.
She was devastated.
I don't think I can go through with this.
You can't call off the wedding.
How are you gonna pay for your surgery?
I don't know.
You know, I'll just...
I'll sell the car.
Susie, this is your health
we're talking about.
We're getting married.
Karl-
No. Dr. Ron
would be the first to say
that you're doing
the right thing.
I'll figure out some way
to handle Edie.
How? How are you
gonna handle Edie?
That poor woman's dreams
exploded in her face tonight.
You know, it's not like
you can just go out
and buy her flowers,
and everything will be better.
Then I'll propose to her.
Well, that's a little extreme.
Not really. I was probably
gonna do it eventually anyhow.
Obviously we're gonna
have to get a divorce
before I can actually marry her.
But, uh... what?
Nothing. I just...
I didn't know that
you loved her like that.
She's a great kid.
Total package.
What's the matter, Susie Q?
Jealous?
No, of course not.
Well, okay,
this is good because...
you know, if this experience
helped you to realize
your true feelings,
then, uh...
then we did something
good here.
Yeah. I think we have.
Come here.
I can't believe
you thought I was jealous.
It's not like I still have
feelings for you anymore.
You're right.
I I was just fooling around.
So? How did it go?
Fine. I just dropped off
the luggage and left.
Oh.
What was that for?
No reason.
Hey, I was thinking...
we should
look into adoption.
Seriously?
Mm-hmm.
But I thought you wanted
a kid with your own DNA?
Blood isn't everything.
Hey!
I heard ya lost
your kids yesterday.
Yeah.
It was cleared up.
It was just a little confusion.
Uh, help me out here
with something.
What exactly is it
you look for in a baby-sitter?
Excuse me?
Well, I may be ancient,
like you say,
but I've never gotten drunk
and lost track of three kids.
What?
I smelled wine
on Bree van de Kamp
when she was looking
for your boys.
That's ridiculous.
Is it?
Yesterday I found her passed out
on her front lawn,
drunk as a skunk.
I've known Bree for years and years.
There's no way she was drinking
while baby-sitting my kids.
So... just go spread your poison
somewhere else. Okay?
I just thought I'd do you
a favor and let you know,
that's all.
Okay, well, thanks.
Hi.
You, um, you recovered from
all of yesterday's excitement?
Oh, truthfully, I haven't been
able to get my mind off it.
What a scare, huh?
Yeah, although
I still can't figure out
how my boys
managed to sneak past you.
Well, you know
how boys are at that age.
They're escape artists.
Like lightning.
It's just, Penny...
Penny?
Well, I mean,
I just don't understand
how Porter and Preston managed
to wrangle her into the stroller
and then make it out
your front door
without you even noticing.
I guess
if you'd fallen asleep...
it could've happened
like that, I-I guess.
You know, I think, um,
I must have been cleaning
the kitchen,
and I... I just
didn't hear them
because of the noise
from the dishwasher.
Look, I apologize in advance
for how this is going to sound,
but I have to ask it. It's just
gonna eat away at me.
Were you drinking
while baby-sitting my kids?
No!
Oh...
you know, I may have had
just the tiniest little bit
of Chardonnay.
Oh, gosh, you got drunk,
and you passed out.
Lynette, if I close my eyes
even for a moment,
it's because of these
antihistamines I've been taking.
Really? Is that why you passed out
on your front lawn yesterday morning?
Now that you're speaking to me
in a fairly accusatory tone,
may I remind you that
I was doing you a favor?
You put my kids in danger,
and then you lied about it.
Do you not get how big that is?
Do you have some
kind of problem with alcohol?
No! The only problem I have
is with your children.
They're incorrigible
because you let them run amok.
And if I hadn't drifted off,
they would have waited
until I was in the bathroom
or stuck on the phone
or upstairs doing laundry.
On any given day,
how many glasses of wine
do you put away?
I will not be spoken to
like that.
I just won't.
Now and then,
we all need a little help...
so we ask for small favors.
Thanks. I owe you one.
But it's always best
to be wary of those
eager to come to our rescue.
Well, go on.
Kiss the bride.
Because even the smallest
of favors...
Sure thing, Tom. I'd be happy
to baby-sit for you.
My, have you noticed
how clogged my rain gutters are?
...carries a price tag.
Yes, everyone has an agenda...
I heard about your operation,
aunt Inez,
and I'm jumping on a plane right now
to come and help you out.
...no matter what
they may tell us.
No, I'm happy to,
and I'm prepared to stay
as long as it takes.
And in those rare instances
where there is no ulterior motive,
we're so taken aback
that we may fail
to recognize the truth:
That a loving friend has just
done us an enormous favor.
Previously on "Desperate Housewives":
You put my kids in danger,
and then you lied about it.
Do you have some kind of problem with alcohol?
Lynette asked a loaded question.
I'm the one who was sleeping with your son,
but it's over now.
No, you're wrong.
It's not even close to being over.
Gabrielle confessed...
Here's your mail.
...while Noah's search for Zach...
I worry for that boy.
What kind of people
would buy a baby from a junkie?
...played perfectly into Felicia's plot...
See to it that Paul Young
has a toy chest of his very own.
...for revenge.
What made my husband Paul Young
such a good investor
was his uncanny ability
to anticipate the future.
Zach, how did you do this?
He foresaw the necessity of the Velcro shoe.
He predicted the advent
of the $3 cup of coffee.
He even anticipated
the surprising boom in bottled water.
Yeah, it's Paul Young.
I've been reading about
the election results in Brazil.
It's time to buy sugar.
But the crystal ball
that served Paul so well in the stock market
sometimes failed him closer to home.
Paul Young?
Yeah.
Detective Sullivan.
You need to come downtown for questioning.
About what?
We're investigating reports
of credit card fraud,
and your name has been linked with several of the victims.
Well, it must be some mistake.
Could be.
But we still need to go downtown
and straighten it out.
All right.
Well...
how long is this gonna take?
Don't worry about it. It's just a mix-up.
Let's go.
What's going on? I thought
you just wanted to ask me some questions.
That's after you're booked.
Booked? Booked for what?
You can't book him here anyhow, detective.
Computers are down.
We're all full up.
You gotta take him down to county.
What is going on? This is crazy.
I wanna call my lawyer.
What the hell do you guys think
you're doing anyway? Huh?
This is ridiculous.
I get a phone call!
Yes, in the world of investments,
my husband had
a remarkable ability to see the future.
Got a message for you, Paul Young.
Deirdre's father said to give you his regards.
Aah!
But sadly,
Paul didn't see this one coming at all.
2x16:
There Is No Other Way
Bree Van De Kamp had a weekly routine
she'd been following for years.
She cleaned on Tuesdays.
She paid her bills on Wednesdays.
She did her laundry on Thursdays.
And after these daily chores were completed,
she would reward herself
with a little drink.
What Bree didn't know
was this latest addition to her routine
had been noticed by her friends.
And it had now become
part of their routine to discuss it.
So, apparently Bree had a few too many
and passed out.
Next thing I know, I get a call at work.
Someone found my kids wandering the street.
Oh, my god!
Have you seen Bree since?
No. I'm worried about her,
but I don't know how I'm gonna
get over what she did.
Hey, Bree.
How you doing today?
I'm really well.
Um, I just saw you all talking
before Lynette went off to work.
What were you all talking about?
Oh, nothing, really.
Carlos and I are gonna go
see the adoption counselor today.
I'm checking myself into the hospital.
I'm finally gonna get that surgery.
Oh. Good for you.
Did Lynette mention the little tiff we had?
Just in passing.
She barely mentioned it.
Because what happened was,
I accidentally mixed
my antihistamine medication with,
you know, a little glass of wine I was having,
and I-
I fell asleep, you know, while I was...
watching her kids.
I mean, I like a little wine with dinner,
I mean, now and then. You know, who doesn't?
But, uh, I mean,...
... you know, to trash my entire reputation...
Oh, Bree, she didn't trash you. Honest.
Well, good. I mean, I just-
I really wouldn't want you
to get the wrong impression.
Well, I'm-I'm going to the mall.
They're having a white sale today.
I think I'm gonna get a new bath mat.
Oh, does anyone need one?
No, I'm good.
Okay, take care.
Wow, did you smell the alcohol on her breath?
I sure did.
Oh.
Then our Eskimo turns in the camera and says,
"Polar fresh mints will give your breath
an A+, too. "
So what do you think?
It feels a little familiar.
Really? I don't think so.
No, I'm pretty sure
the Lowell group used Eskimos
in a deodorant commercial they had last month.
Remember?
Oh, this is completely different.
Those were jock Eskimos
competing in the Iditarod.
Our Eskimo's trying to, you know,
patch things up with his wife.
Yeah. No, I get the subtle distinction.
I think we can do better.
Okay? So, Sally, you're up.
What do you got for me?
Hey.
Hey.
"I got the subtle distinction"?
What was that about?
If you really wanna do this now,
shut the door.
Okay, sure, I was a little bitchy.
But you know why?
You did a half-ass job in there.
Hey, you may not like my idea,
but you can't say I didn't work hard.
Oh, please.
I live with you.
Last night, when you should've been trying
to make that pitch work,
you were watching the game.
I wasn't watching the game.
I saw you!
What, okay, now I can't check the score?
Are you saying you gave your heart
and soul to that Eskimo pitch?
I worked really hard on that pitch.
Did you give it 100%?
Well, exactly. So? Big deal.
Go work up some new ideas,
and then we'll go over it during lunch.
Okay?
You're the boss.
Yes, I am.
Hey.
Susan.
Good to see you again.
I'm really looking forward to your surgery.
And I'm really hoping you're a lefty.
Nope. I can't even write my name.
But that's what I get for
throwing my kid a roller-skating party.
Funny. So what about my surgery?
Oh, I'll still do it.
With Dr. Ron's help, of course.
Dr. Cunningham will be standing
right beside me.
With my hands and his brain,
you got the best parts of both of us.
Then I'm on board.
We're keeping you under observation, so,
hopefully, we'll operate tomorrow.
Uh, if you don't mind,
I'd like a minute
to consult with my patient.
Oh! Right, your, um, little thing.
What "little thing"?
Um, well, it was-
it was gonna be a surprise, but...
Oh, my God!
They're beautiful.
Um, look, I've been thinking about us
a lot lately-
about putting this operation behind us
and where we'll go from there.
Our future...
together.
And I really suck at putting my emotions
into words, which is, um,
it's why I wrote it all down.
There's a card.
Oh.
Uh, but you can't read it.
Not-not while I'm here anyway.
It's way, way too stressful.
Um, I am going to go now.
Wow.
Wow.
Oh, he's so romantic.
May I?
Oh, it's sort of private.
Well, I did help him pick out the flowers.
Oh. Um...
Okay.
There's more on the back.
So, how does this work?
Do we flip through a catalog or something?
I wish it was that easy.
You have to understand, for every baby
there are ten couples who want it.
You don't choose your child.
The birth mother chooses you.
Really?
So, what do you think our chances are?
We will do anything that we need to do.
Well, your typical birth mother
is usually a young girl,
and she'll just wanna make sure
you're quality people.
Now, to show her that,
you'll be putting together
a parent portfolio.
What's that?
Family pictures, character references,
that kind of stuff.
So, um, we're auditioning to be parents?
I guess you could say that.
So just to be clear,
some slutty cheerleader
gets knocked up by the soccer coach
behind the local gas'n'gulp, and she is going
to make sure we're quality people?
You don't need to answer that.
You know, you don't have to hide it from me.
Hmm?
Drinking? It doesn't bother me.
Oh, I wasn't hiding anything.
I was simply...
enjoying the day.
What do you want?
Well, um, Mason was my ride to school.
And his dad's moving them to Tucson, so...
Oh, well, if you need a ride to school,
I'm happy to drive you.
No, that's not what I want. I want a car.
Well, then I suggest you get a job.
Why should I go work my ass off
at some fast food place
when I can already afford what I want?
Andrew, we're not touching your trust fund.
It's my money.
Not until you're 21.
And if I had my way, you wouldn't get
your hands on it until you're 50.
I mean, we both know
you're gonna waste every penny of it.
Why are you being like this?
Because, sweetheart,
it is my job to teach you
about responsibility,
setting goals, delayed gratification.
What do you know about delayed gratification?
It's not even noon yet, and you're already
on your third glass of wine.
You know, on second thought,
I won't be driving you to school.
The walk will do you good.
Mom, I'm not kidding around.
I want my money.
The answer is no.
Well, aren't we a mean old drunk?
Whatever that was supposed to teach me,
consider the lesson learned.
What are you doing here?
I'm just enjoying the silky
smooth moves of Dr. Ron.
Or should I say, "Dr. Love"?
Give me that.
This is my favorite-
"I can't wait to be in the operating room with you
"so I can touch your heart,
"because you've already touched mine so deeply. "
Okay, that part sounds better
when you don't read it out loud.
And what are you doing reading it anyway?
Those are Dr. Ron's private thoughts.
Yeah, I got that.
You know,
I sense that he really likes you, Susie.
So?
So, do you really like him?
Of course I do.
He's smart and funny and kind.
Smart, funny, kind.
I don't hear the word "love" in there.
Well, that's a big word.
We just started dating,
and we have a connection,
and I'm gonna follow it through
and see where it goes.
Oh, I get it. You're gonna string him along
till you feel something you don't
and waste the next five years of your life.
As opposed to the twelve I wasted on you?
Why are we talking about this?
I don't recall asking you your opinion.
Because we're married
and I have certain rights,
and one of them is the right to badger you.
Okay, you know, you can leave now.
I wish I could M.R.I. your soul-
Out!
It's not funny.
Hey, watch out for my wife.
She's on a tear.
Oh, here's one we took on vacation.
Hmm. Gaby,
these pictures have to be wholesome.
They gotta say...
"these people will do a great job
raising a child. "
So?
So you're topless.
Yeah, but it's St. Barts,
and your hands are covering
my naughty parts.
Do you mean the hand that's holding
the tequila shot,
or the one that's holding the Cuban cigar?
Yeah, that was a good trip.
Gaby!
Fine. We won't use it.
We can't use any of 'em.
Every single picture of the two of us,
we're either drinking or smoking or naked.
So we like to have fun.
I mean, who doesn't understand that
better than an unwed, knocked-up teenager?
This is serious.
If we can't sell ourselves as good people...
Well, then we'll just have to find someone
who can do it for us.
So you want me to, uh...
pitch you as parents?
You're in advertising. You can do it.
Just write us a character reference
saying we're great with kids.
Oh, this is for you.
Oh. Well, you don't have to bribe me.
We're all friends here.
Keeping that in mind, would it also be okay
if we were your kids' godparents?
Oh! Uh... I guess.
Great, and can we take
some fake pictures to document it?
I don't suppose you brought a corkscrew?
You didn't have a warrant,
and if you don't arrest him,
then you gotta tell me what he wants.
Hello, Mike.
Felicia, what are you doing here?
Oh, I left in such a rush.
There was a lot of old business
I forgot to wrap up.
Well, it must be pretty important business.
Gets you to move back in next door
to the man you think murdered your sister.
It's funny you should mention Paul.
You know, the police came
and took him away last night.
The police?
And from the way they were manhandling him,
oh, I don't think he'll be back anytime soon.
No, I just wanna talk to him, that's all...
What the hell's going on?
It's none of your concern, Mike.
You listen to me. If anything happens to Paul Young-
It already happened.
Hours ago.
He's dead?
Like I said,
it's none of your concern.
Maybe you don't get it, Noah.
You screwed up.
You just killed the most important person
in your grandson's life.
Do you think he's gonna have anything
to do with you once he finds out?
And believe me,
I'll make sure he finds out.
So, honey, the meat loaf... it's, um,
it's a little burnt.
Oh, right, I was talking
to Susan on the phone,
and I left it in a little longer
than I should've. Sorry.
It's okay.
Is it that bad?
No. No, not bad at all.
Oh, good.
Parker, don't put your elbows on the table.
Come on.
But you'd agree it wasn't your best effort.
Huh?
The meal, the task you agreed to take on.
You'd agree that you didn't
give it 100%, right?
Tom, if you're gonna make a point,
why don't you do it now
before I hurl the plate at you?
Nobody gives 100% of his effort
all the time because they can't.
It is impossible.
You do the best you can
with the time and energy you have.
Stop right there! This is meat loaf.
Your presentation was business.
You're saying the client deserves
more effort than your own family?
Okay.
So, if I apologize for upsetting you at work,
can we get past it and enjoy our meal?
Absolutely.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I am sorry.
Thanks.
So, boys, how do you enjoy the meat loaf?
It's a little salty.
Yeah.
Just eat it.
There.
Perfect.
All right.
All right, one more time.
What?
Yeah.
Dude, I don't wanna mess up your face.
Do you love me?
Then do what I tell you.
Rough day.
Yeah.
I wonder if there's any way
that we can turn it around still.
Good question.
But what to do? What to do?
Yeah.
Hi! What's up?
Why do you keep trying to do that?
What?
Trying to get on top.
Of you? No, I'm not.
You were pushing on me
like you were trying to sack me.
I felt it.
Are you serious?
Tom, I wasn't doing anything.
I was just going for it.
I was just lost in the moment. Oh, come on!
Come on, this is silly. I don't wanna argue.
I mean, unless it turns you on.
Does it? 'Cause then I'm all about it, baby.
What was that?
What-
What was what?
You were bracing.
You were bracing with your leg.
I was trying to lie on top of you,
and you were bracing yourself
against the mattress
so you didn't have to get on your back.
Try and deny it. Try and deny it. You can't.
Okay, okay, can I just mention
you're talking like a crazy person?
You can't give it up for a second, can you?
You always have to call the shots. Always.
Is this about me being your boss again?
You gotta get over it.
That's exactly my point.
Exactly.
You are not just my boss at the office.
You're my boss everywhere.
Oh, that's ridiculous.
You run the show.
You run the show,
and I'm along for the ride.
I just push the little shopping cart,
let the woman do all the driving.
Tom...
I'm the caddy husband.
I carry your clubs.
I am so sorry you feel that way,
but you cannot put that on me.
This is your life.
You wanna run it?
Then step on up.
You wanna drive?
Grab the steering wheel.
I mean what else am I supposed to say?
I'm gonna check on the kids.
Time to check your blood pressure.
Oh, sure.
Oh, that's a little tight.
Does it have to be that tight?
Yes.
Oh.
Okay. Ow, ow!
That's actually starting to be painful.
Really? That surprises me.
I just assumed you were dead inside.
Ow! Ow! What the hell are you doing?
I told myself to stay out of this,
but I can't.
I know that you're married.
I am not!
Really? Hmm, 'cause that man that came
to see you yesterday, he said you're his wife.
Oh! Yeah, oh...
no, no, he just said that 'cause
we used to be married.
It's just a force of habit.
Oh, that explains everything.
Except that I checked your insurance forms,
and you're still married.
So that makes you a lying, adulterous skank.
Oh, no. No, no. No, no, nurse Heisel.
Ow, ow, ow, ow! Ow, nurse Heisel!
Ugh! Nurse!
Nurse Heisel, I can explain.
Can you, skank?
Yes. Okay.
I am married, but it's only because
my insurance ran out.
My ex-husband has a really good
coverage plan,
so he said that he would remarry me
so I could get my operation.
Only I didn't wanna tell Dr. Ron
'cause I didn't want him
to be an accomplice to fraud.
So, you're what...?
Protecting him?
Yeah. It yes, I am.
Okay.
As long as you're not two-timing him.
He feels so strongly about you.
I know. I read the card.
But did you read between the lines?
What do you mean?
Okay, I shouldn't be telling you this,
but when we were picking out
the flowers for you,
he said that he was working up
the courage to say he loves you.
Really?
Yes!
But you have to act surprised, okay?
Oh, yeah, I'll be surprised.
So, I guess we have the whole
insurance thing worked out.
Oh! Pfft. Don't worry about that. Please.
Who am I to cast stones?
I mean, heck...
I didn't pass my nurse's exam.
They didn't even ask me!
Andrew, did I hear the bell?
Oh, hello.
I'm Samuel Bormanis. I'm here to see Andrew.
Oh, okay. Are you a friend of Andrew's?
I'm his lawyer.
His lawyer? Well, why on earth
would Andrew need a lawyer?
Here you go, Sam.
Honey, what happened to to your face?
I...
You hit me.
Don't you remember?
For the record, I did not punch my son.
I slapped him with an open palm.
Yeah, but, mom, the thing is,
when you drink,
you don't know your own strength.
This is ridiculous.
Can't you see this is a performance?
Mrs. Van De Kamp, I've heard enough.
Clearly, this environment is a highly
dysfunctional one.
Andrew has retained my services in order
to pursue a healthier living situation.
And what might that be?
I, um, I wanna be emancipated.
Emancipated?
As an emancipated minor,
Andrew would be able to live on his own.
He'd still go to school, of course,
but he'd be released
from all adult supervision.
Well, that's the silliest thing
I've ever heard of.
How would he support himself?
Well, he'd be in complete control
of his own finances.
So that's what this is about  your trust fund?
Obviously,
we'd all prefer not to go to family court,
but with the violence and your D.U.I. charge,
it could get ugly.
Uh, Mr. Bormanis,
I'll need a little time to think about this.
You have 24 hours.
Boy, it really looks like
we're having a good time.
I sure hope this works.
Well, as long as they don't
make me play guitar,
I think we're home free.
Mr. and Mrs. Solis, Rhoda can see you now.
Wow!
It looks like you spend lots
of time with these kids.
Oh, we take our roles
as godparents very seriously.
Don't we, honey?
Mm-hmm. Yes.
Oh, they're precious. What are their names?
Parker and, uh...
Porter, uh...
and, uh...
Well, they're all p's. It is super cute.
One sec.
Do you need me, Helen?
Hello, Gabrielle.
Carlos.
I didn't know you were adopting.
Preston!
The other one's name is Preston.
Helen, you work here?
You all know each other?
What a small world.
It sure is.
Mrs. Solis hired my son to do her yard work.
And also, she would rape him.
Okay, first of all, it was statutory,
and it happened so long ago.
Was it?
I think it was only about a year ago.
No, it was a year,
because it was right before your husband
went to prison on slave labor charges.
Rhoda, if you don't mind,
I think I'll handle the Solis case myself.
I'd like to make it my top priority.
Okay.
Oh, and, um, Gabrielle,
don't bother trying to contact
any other adoption agencies in the area.
I'll make sure they know all about you.
I think I have to break up with Dr. Ron.
What? Why?
Because he's a gem.
And apparently he loves me.
I'm sorry. I'm not following.
Lynette, he is everything
I could possibly want in a boyfriend,
and I just don't know if I feel that...
spark.
You know, and I really want to.
Aw, sweetie.
And he keeps telling me how special I am
and how much I mean to him...
how he wants to hold my beating heart
in his hand.
Maybe it's because I just haven't felt
that thunderbolt yet.
You know, with Mike, it hit me.
With Karl, it hit me.
I didn't have to worry about how I felt
because the thunderbolt told me.
Yeah, yeah. Gotta love the thunderbolt.
Do I, though? I mean, I do.
But I don't trust it anymore.
You know, those relationships turned out
to be disasters.
Maybe I should stick it out with Dr. Ron,
and I should try heading down a road
that's growing and slower
into a sort of kind of love that would
sustain itself for 50 years. Right?
Stability, comfort, endurance I deserve that.
Oh, yes! Of course you do.
Still, you gotta love the thunderbolt.
That's not helpful.
Sorry.
Ah, this is a sign.
Will you shut up?
We lost a baby, found out
we can't conceive another one,
and ran into Helen Rowland at an adoption agency.
God is obviously trying to tell us something.
Carlos, we're Catholics, okay?
God is pretty Johnny one note
on the whole subject of procreation.
Hey, and will you stop
with this defeatist attitude?
Okay, do you want a baby or not?
I think it's time that we faced reality.
We're bad people, and we probably
don't even deserve to be parents.
Well, then who the hell does?
I mean, look at all the idiots popping out kids.
Okay, they're not any more
qualified than we are.
I don't know.
Look, Carlos.
It doesn't matter
what we've done in our past.
Being a parent means rising to the occasion,
and that's exactly what we're gonna do
when we bring our baby home.
This is the first time I really felt like
you wanted to have a baby.
Well, this is the first time
someone told me I couldn't have one.
Okay, so what are we gonna do?
I mean, no adoption agency
is gonna touch us now.
There are ways to get babies, Carlos.
It just might cost us.
I have some contacts
in the police department.
I've been making calls, but I can't seem
to get a straight answer about your dad.
I don't understand.
How do they just lose somebody?
They don't, not by accident.
But I don't think what happened
to your dad was an accident.
What's that supposed to mean?
Zach!
Mrs. Tillman.
Hello, Zachary. You look terrible.
Oh, Mr. Delfino.
Isn't this just a picture?
Felicia, why are you here?
Young Zachary and I
didn't exactly part on the best of terms.
In fact, when the weather's damp,
I'm still reminded of our last good-bye.
But forgive and forget. That's my motto.
Macaroon?
Dad!
You all right?
Now, how did you know I love macaroons?
It won't end here, you know.
Noah Taylor doesn't give up.
Look, don't worry about us.
We'll be gone by morning.
No, it's too late for that now.
I guarantee he's got people watching you.
What is it with you anyway?
First, you want me to run.
Now you want us to stick around
like sitting ducks for this maniac.
Go ahead, run.
Noah's got the cops in his pocket.
What do you think's gonna happen
the first time you try to buy gas
with a credit card
or open a new bank account?
So I'm a dead man.
Maybe not.
Not if we use what leverage we have.
No way.
The old man's gonna be dead
in a couple of months, maybe less.
Let him meet Zach,
play the doting grandfather-
I said forget it.
I'll do it.
If it means he'll leave us alone,
I'm ready to be leveraged.
Nicholson will be coming in
in about 15 minutes with a pitch,
so let's grab everybody and make sure
we're all on the same page.
Hang on a second.
What's going on?
I need to say this.
Ah, yeah...
I have been giving you a lot of grief lately
about being the boss.
But it's just hard for a guy to feel like
he's not in charge of any part of his life.
But, honey, it goes back and forth.
I know. But it just feels
a little one-sided lately,
and sometimes I need to drive the train.
But, look, I know it is my issue.
It's my issue,
and I will step up and deal with it.
Mmm.
Whoa. Hello.
What's going on, huh?
I'm picking up where we left off.
Last night.
Oh, I get it. I get it.
Ooh! This is your idea of driving the train.
And it's very manly and really impressive,
but it's really, really bad timing.
You can't be serious.
Mmm. We're gonna-we're gonna be late.
Yeah, we are going to be late.
Okay.
There is nothing more important than family.
And I think it's so unfair some are denied
their God-given right to parent
just because of a few sordid
incidents in their past.
Now,...
I may have to explore some unconventional
paths to find your child.
I might even have to take action
some might view as unsavory.
But before I do...
I need proof that the two of you
are prepared
to face the challenges ahead.
$20,000.
Is that proof enough for you?
Yes, it is.
Nice to meet you, young man.
I'm not gonna hug you.
I don't care if you are my grandfather.
Ah, that's okay.
Hugging's not really my thing.
Mike, could you wait outside?
I'd like to be alone with Zachary.
Not a chance.
Just curious...
why was it so important you see me?
You're my grandson.
My flesh and blood.
Isn't it only natural
I'd want a relationship with you?
What kind of relationship can we have
when I know you tried to kill my dad?
Surely, you can understand the rage
I must feel towards your father.
Go ahead.
Feel all the rage you wanna feel.
But if anything happens to him,
I swear to God you are never
gonna see me again.
You only met me two minutes ago.
And here you are,
already blackmailing me.
I couldn't be prouder.
I'm serious.
I want you to swear
you're not gonna do anything to my dad.
Which dad?
You have two of 'em.
You know who I'm talking about-
my dad, the man who raised me,
the only man I'm ever gonna care about.
So swear.
I swear.
Well, now that the ground rules have been set,
who's up for some meaningless small talk?
Well, if it isn't the plumber.
You here to see Susan?
Uh, yeah, I just wanted to talk
to her before her operation.
Oh? You're cutting it kinda close.
She's just about to be wheeled into surgery.
You know, she's dating her surgeon.
Yeah, she told me.
You met him?
Yeah.
He's like 6 years old.
Those for her?
Yeah. The florist
was having a sale on lilacs.
Dr. Ron just bought her the biggest bouquet
of roses you've ever seen.
It was disgusting.
And the note that went with it
made my teeth hurt, it was so saccharin.
He used words like "soul mate" and "eternity. "
I almost puked in the vase.
What'd Susan think about that?
Well, she seemed to be really into it.
Mike!
Oh, wait, stop! Go back!
Stop! Stop a second.
Hey! What are you doing here?
I just, uh, wanted to wish you luck
before your surgery.
Aw, that's so sweet.
You came all the way down here just for me.
Yep. That's why I came.
Oh, it means a lot to me that you came.
Well, you take care, Susan.
Okay.
Bye.
You forgot to give her your flowers.
Ah, it's no big deal.
Hi, Susan.
How are those drugs working for you?
You feeling good?
Super-duper.
How are you feeling?
Well, um, you know I want you to know,
what I said the other day-
that corny stuff about me holding
your heart in my hands...
Well, what I meant to say was,
my feelings for you they keep growing,
and, uh, I think-
well, I hope that you feel
the same way about me.
Ah, hell, Susan.
I love you.
Aw, thank you.
I love Mike.
Mike?
Susan, who's Mike?
Mike is love. Mmm.
Who the hell is Mike?
I don't know,
but she's married to a guy named Karl.
I'm so, so sorry.
I should've told you, Dr. Ron.
Mmm, Mike, Mike, Mike...
Oh, why are you always falling in love
with skanks?
You beautiful, beautiful man!
Oh!
Okay, we ready to go here?
Yeah. Sure.
Let's cut this bitch open.
What are you doing?
Your lawyer left a message on my machine.
It seems we have a hearing in four weeks,
and I wanna be ready.
Oh, I get it.
So, uh, so you're gonna pretend
to be sober for the judge?
Oh, there's no pretending.
I am going to my first A.A. meeting tomorrow.
Of course, I picked one
in the worst part of town
so I won't run into anybody I know.
Which, of course, means I will.
All right, so what is that gonna prove?
Perception is reality, Andrew.
And if people perceive me to have
a drinking problem, then I do.
And I certainly don't want
some idiotic judge
using my hobby
as an excuse to make you rich.
So, I'm simply going to give up my wine
and become a recovering alcoholic.
Good plan, but it'll never work.
See, I'll bet you still end up
coming to court hammered.
Oh, Andrew, you don't think
I love you enough to give up alcohol?
Look, I'm 17, all right?
So, you can only keep me here
for another year.
Why not just let me go?
Because I'm not done with you yet.
It's my job to teach you,
and you are not half the man
I know you can be.
Yeah, well, I got news for you:
This is as good as I'm gonna get.
If I really thought that, I'd get
a gun right now and kill us both.
Mom, we're both so unhappy.
Why not just let me take my trust fund,
and I'll get out of your hair forever?
Please.
You're a stone cold bitch, you know that?
I'm sorry. I didn't quite catch that.
I hate you.
You know, the opposite of love isn't hate.
It's indifference.
And if you hate me,
that means you still care,
and we're still connected,
and I still have a chance to set you right.
This is how Bree Van De Kamp
finally came to change her weekly routine.
She still cleaned on Tuesdays...
paid her bills on Wednesdays...
and did her laundry on Thursdays.
But her Fridays
were now reserved for a meeting.
A special meeting, where she stood
in front of people she didn't know...
My name is Bree,
and I am an alcoholic.
...and said things she didn't believe.
And afterwards, Bree would come home
and reward herself...
on the completion of another successful week.
Previously on "Desperate Housewives"...
But no adoption agency's
gonna touch us now.
There are ways to get babies, Carlos.
$20,000.
Wheels were put in motion...
I love you.
Aw, thank you.
I love Mike.
True emotions were revealed...
Who the hell is Mike?
Perception is reality,
Andrew.
My name is Bree,
and I am an alcoholic.
And false pretenses
became a way of life.
Gabrielle Solis had always been
a demanding shopper.
Carlos, come on!
They're here!
And whatever the purchase,
she always expected
the very best.
Whether it was exotic perfume
shipped over from Paris...
a high fashion gown straight
from a runway in Milan...
or designer shoes
flown in from Manhattan.
But on this day,
her expectations were
going to be put to the test.
You see, Gabrielle was now
shopping for a baby,
and there was a problem...
with the manufacturer.
Mostly, I just wanna feel
like I'm giving my baby
to people who have what it takes
to be really great parents.
Well, you won't find
another couple
with more love for a child.
Isn't that right, honey?
Honey?
Right, right.
Uh, lots of love.
Honey, can I talk to you
for a second?
Yeah.
Okay, look, we have
to find another mother.
Why?
Okay, this isn't easy to say, so I'm just gonna say it,
but have you taken a good look at her?
Oh, my God.
Are you trying to say that
you don't want Deanna's baby
because she's plain?
No, plain I can handle.
Carlos, since that woman
has walked into our house,
the clocks
have stopped working.
No one can predict what
a child is gonna look like.
For all you know, her kid could
end up winning beauty contests.
With her D.N.A., the only thing that kid's
gonna be winning is best in show.
Look, Carlos, I am sorry,
but I want a pretty baby,
so let's find another mother.
Mnh-Mnh. I'm not gonna let
your shallow obsession
with looks screw this up.
I want a child. Any child.
Fine. Just know that in a couple
of days when that thing is born,
and you're gonna have
to cuddle and snuggle up
with something
with that face on it,
don't come crying to me.
I'm sorry.
Now where were we?
We were just talking about
the custody arrangement
once Deanna gives birth.
It's usually best
that the mother
doesn't see the child
at all.
So as soon as the doctors finish
giving their initial checkup...
...the baby
will be handed over you.
Yes, Gabrielle had always been
a demanding shopper.
Sorry.
Because she knew
there are some purchases...
that can't be returned.
2x17:
Could I Leave You?
At 6:10 the next morning,
Deanna Pruse
went into premature labor
and gave birth
to what would eventually be
an incredibly attractive
baby boy.
At 11:43, Dr. Hanson Mills
cut the umbilical cord,
Forever separating
mother and child.
At that exact same moment,
Dr. Ron McCready entered
the private room of Susan Mayer
with every intention
of severing their connection.
Hey there. How's it goin'?
Great.
I'm about to be released.
Oh, that's terrific.
Who's Mike?
I...
Why do you ask?
I don't know. No reason.
Ah, it's just, uh..
Just before the operation,
just before you went under,
I said, "I love you,"
And you said,
"I love Mike. "
I did?
Oh, is that why you haven't been in
to see me since my surgery?
Answer the question.
I don't even know
a Mike.
Everyone knows a Mike.
Yes, everyone does know a Mike.
Actually, you're right.
I did know a Mike in college.
We did this play together,
"Pippin. " It wasn't very good.
Anyways, I never thought of him,
so you shouldn't be accusing me.
I was probably
just hallucinating.
Fine, fine.
So... who's the guy
you're married to?
Damn that nurse Heisel!
Or should I say, "who's the guy
you're cheating on?"
Okay, yes,
I did remarry my ex,
But it was only because
he has great health insurance.
Didn't Miss blabbermouth
tell you that, too?
You... you committed insurance fraud?
Only in the legal sense.
And I just didn't tell you
because I wanted to protect you.
Susan...
Okay, you know what?
You should come over to dinner
and meet Karl, and you can see
that there is absolutely
nothing between us.
So wait,
once you're fully recovered
you're gonna divorce him?
Oh, yeah, that's the plan.
I swear.
And you swear that you're not
in love with anyone named Mike?
Sure.
Okay.
Come here.
I believe you.
Next morning,
I woke up in an alley.
My wallet had been stolen.
I was lying in a pool
of my own vomit.
That's when I knew
I'd hit rock bottom.
Okay, who's next?
Bree.
Oh! Um, I couldn't
possibly top that.
Thank you, though.
Hi. Before coming
to these meetings,
I never realized how messy
substance abusers can be.
We usually leave
the doughnut crumbs
For the overeaters anonymous
group at meets after us.
You know,
just to mess with 'em.
You're awful.
So... tell me, Bree,
how long have you been sober?
Gosh, um...
I'm not exactly sure.
Oh. Is somebody
still drinking?
Now why would you
say that?
I've never met
an alcoholic yet
who didn't know exactly how long
it'd been since his last drink.
Okay, you got me.
I'm not really
an alcoholic.
You don't say.
It's true. I'm coming here
because of my son.
You see, he's... he's trying
to take me to court to become
an emancipated minor, and he's
planning on lying to the judge
and telling him that
I am some sort of dreadful lush.
So I'm coming to these meetings
to give the impression
that I have changed.
But you don't really need to change
because you don't have
a problem with alcohol.
Exactly.
I'll tell you what.
Here's my card.
And if you ever
do have a problem
or you just feel like talking,
give me a call, okay?
I know you think
I'm kidding myself,
but I'm not.
I'm nothing like
you people.
I just don't have
a compulsive personality.
Hmm.
Word is out all over town
that you're unhappy at Zimms,
so why not jump ship
and come to Parcher & Murphy?
I swear, Veronica,
you would fit in so well here.
I do need
to make a change, Lynette,
but the money
you're offering...
Yeah, it sucks,
but there are other perks:
The expense account, the corner office...
I don't know.
You're just gonna have to give
me some time to think about it.
Fair enough, fair enough.
Okay, what is your secret?
How can you eat like that
and keep your figure?
It's the breast-feeding.
It burns so many calories.
It's like having a treadmill strapped to your chest.
I didn't know
you had a child.
Yes, my son Donovan.
He's the love of my life.
Really, Veronica?
Well, you know, there's another
perk that I just thought of.
Oh, my gosh,
this is fantastic!
They don't have
day care at Zimms.
How can they not?
For working parents like
you and me, it's a necessity.
So is the pot
getting sweeter?
Would people here be cool
about my breast-feeding Donovan?
The guys at Zimms
were real jerks about that.
Parcher & Murphy
is completely mother-friendly.
No one would say a word.
Oh!
What the heck, I'm in.
Yeah?
Well, that's fantastic!
Oh, my God,
whose kids are those?
I have absolutely no idea.
Let's go hammer out the details.
Okay.
Mm. Ooh.
These can't be
our only choices, Mr. Beale.
I mean, come on.
Each girl is uglier
than the next.
Look, finding a gorgeous
pregnant woman who's willing
to give her baby to a couple
with a criminal record
isn't exactly a walk in the park.
I don't care if it's a walk in the sewer.
We are hemorrhaging money
into your bank account,
and I expect to see results.
You know, Mrs. Solis,
you can catch more flies
with honey than with vinegar.
If I wanted to catch flies,
all I would have to do
is call up one of these girls.
Trust me,
the flies would follow.
Excuse me, sir, there's
a Libby Collins here for you.
I'll be right out there.
Uh, I took the liberty
of inviting this girl
down here to meet you.
Now I wouldn't exactly say
she's a quality human being,
but she is attractive.
If you don't respond to her,
I'm afraid I'm out of ideas.
He's going to dump us
as clients
if you don't stop
being so damn picky.
We're gonna
have to stare at this face
for the next 18 years.
I don't think now
is the time to skimp on quality.
Gabrielle, Carlos...
I'd like you to meet Libby.
Well, now,
this I can work with.
So getting pregnant
was the worst thing that
could've ever happened to me,
'cause I went into debt
and I had to stop performing.
Libby's a pole dancer
in a strip club.
Oh!
Wow, that... that sounds
like interesting work.
You'd think so,
but it gets old quickly.
My big dream
is to become a choreographer.
Really?
Yeah. I made up this one move.
It's called
"the serpent's tongue,"
And all the girls at the club
are doing it now. It's so cool.
If I had a pole
I could show you.
Well, we'll have to go down
to the club and check that out.
We'll make a night of it.
Yeah, we'll do that.
So, Libby,
who's the father?
Honestly, I don't know.
I mean, there's a lot of guys
who come into the club,
And they all buy me drinks,
And sometimes I get a little bit
more friendly than I intend to.
I hope you don't think
I'm a slut.
No!
No, actually,
all we think about
when we look at you
is how pretty you are.
Well, I've heard enough,
Mr. Beale.
If Libby here likes us as much
as much as we like her,
we should just go ahead
and move to adopt her baby girl.
First, we should probably talk
about how much money I want.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Nobody's buying a baby here.
That's illegal.
Money can never
exchange hands.
Libby, you'll make a list
of your expenses,
and the Solises here will pay.
Oh, but can't they also
buy me gifts?
I knew this one girl who gave up
her baby, and she got a Harley.
Well, I don't know that we can
afford a Harley, but I'm sure
we'll find some way
to express our gratitude.
Okay.
Whatever.
Well, my lunch break is over,
so I have get back
to the club.
Till I get rid of this kid,
they got me slinging drinks.
It was really nice to meet you,
Mr. and Mrs. Soulless.
Oh, it's actually
pronounced Solis.
Sorry.
So what kind of name is that?
Uh, it's Mexican.
Both our families
come from Guadalajara.
Huh.
I figured you were Italian.
Nope. Latino.
Proud of it.
Good for you.
Wow, she's... gorgeous.
Yeah. My little girl's gonna
inherit some wonderful genes.
Is this
Libby's real hair color?
Yes, it's all natural,
from her straight teeth
to her "c" cup.
And I know she's athletic
because she's a pole dancer,
so I really hope that my
little girl inherits that as well.
No, the athletic gene,
not the pole dancing gene.
Suzie-baby?
Oh, I got your call, uh...
I thought I'd stop by.
I didn't realize
you had company. Hello, ladies.
Um, we'll just be a second.
Just wheel me.
Be right back.
Just be a second.
Did he just call her "baby"?
Yeah. When did they
stop hating each other?
I need you to ditch Edie tomorrow night
and have dinner with Dr. Ron and me.
Now why would I do that?
Well, for starters, because you banged your
secretary and owe me for the rest of your life.
I'll bring the wine.
Well, you know,
before Mike came along,
I always just assumed they'd get back together.
Why?
I thought they always annoyed
the heck out of each other.
You didn't know them
during the good times.
I mean, there was such a spark
between them, so much passion.
They would always
make each other laugh.
You actually told Dr. Ron
that you still love Mike?
Okay, will you shut up?
It's not funny. I was drugged.
Right. Sorry, sorry.
So how'd you
get out of that one?
I lied and I told him
I didn't know a Mike.
Everyone knows a Mike.
I am aware of that.
So why didn't you just...
'Cause I panicked, okay?
Dr. Ron hadn't come in
to see me since the operation
and I was feeling
insecure and...
I just didn't
feel like the truth
was a luxury I could afford.
Yes, go ahead.
You may resume laughing.
Uh...
Ladies, always a pleasure.
And you, I'll see you tomorrow.
What?
This is just
a preliminary sketch,
but you see what
I'm thinking of?
I love it. I just love it.
Let's get a copy to Ed.
Oh, shoot, I gotta take this one. I'm sorry, it's Tom.
That's okay. My nanny is here with my son.
I need to go feed him anyway.
Perfect! Take your time.
Hey, honey.
How's the big apple treating ya?
Good. Did those, uh,
snooty clients like your pitch?
Well, that's perfect.
Excellent.
Uh-Huh.
Um, I'm...
I'm, um... I'm gonna have...
I'm gonna call you back.
Oh, my God!
Hello there!
I thought you and your friend
might like some snacks.
He's my lawyer, and this is
privileged communication,
So get out.
Andrew, there's no need to be rude.
This is very kind of you,
Mrs. Van De Kamp.
Well, I'm still appalled
that you're helping my son
with this ridiculous
emancipation scheme,
but you are a guest in my house,
and guests get sandwiches.
You know, if you'd let me go
to his office, you wouldn't have
to pretend to be nice to him.
Andrew, there may be a judge out there
stupid enough
to emancipate you,
but until you find him
I retain all my parental rights,
one of which is to ground your
sorry behind until kingdom come.
Mr. Bormanis,
nice to see you again.
And, um, please don't
get crumbs on my carpet.
You have got
to get me out of here.
That bitch
is driving me crazy.
This case
is not a slam dunk.
Her drinking was supposed
to be our silver bullet,
but since she joined A.A...
We've gotta do something,
because if she wins she's gonna own me.
My advice?
Convince her it's in her
best interest to let you go.
You don't wanna see the inside of a courtroom.
Why?
In family court,
appearance means everything.
If she came off abusive
or stoned or even uncaring,
we'd be in good shape.
But if there's one thing
your mom understands...
It's presentation.
Can I borrow $50?
Purse.
Why do you want
so much money?
I'm 19. Sometimes I need money.
Do I have to be interrogated?
You do if you want
a dime out of me.
What's it for?
Danielle's having her birthday
next week.
I just wanna be sure
I can get her a decent present.
Write her a poem.
It's free.
Is there
something else you want?
Do you think
I like to beg for money?
I do this because
you won't let me get a job.
Looking after your brother
is a full-time job.
For both of us, and you know that.
Well, screw him!
Matthew!
No, I'm serious, mom, because we have both
put our entire lives on hold,
and for what?
It's been almost a year and he hasn't gotten any better.
I see him improving!
That's because you see
what you wanna see!
It is time
to put him away, mom.
Just let some professionals
take care of him.
We wouldn't have to move.
We could have our lives back.
What's wrong?
You fightin'?
No, sweetie.
Matthew's friend Danielle
has a birthday coming up.
We were just talking about
what gift to give her.
Well,
I was thinking jewelry.
So 50 bucks should do it.
Why not $20?
You don't wanna spoil her.
Page 6 is an example of
the new print ad. Check it out.
I'm thirsty.
Oh, shh, honey,
everyone's working.
I'm sorry.
This will just take a sec.
Is it just me,
or is that bizarre?
It's bizarre.
Totally bizarre.
We gotta make her stop this.
Hey, hey. Don't get me wrong.
I find that as bizarre
as you guys do.
But right now this firm needs
Veronica more than she needs us.
Telling a mother how to raise
her kids is an act of war.
We will lose her.
The kid is 5. It's disgusting!
Yeah, well, we'll just ask her to keep
the blinds always drawn when she nurses.
We'll still know what's going on
in there. It's a distraction.
And God forbid
a client sees her.
Okay, so who's gonna tell her?
You're a woman.
It's easier for you
to talk to her about
milk and boobs and stuff.
No! No, uh, please,
don't make me do it.
Why don't you have
Jerry tell her?
I made a pass at her yesterday.
It'd be weird.
You could do it
without offending her.
Come on, Lynette.
Take one for the team.
Okay. But for the record,
the team is made up of wimps.
Well, the team's aware of that
and accepts your loathing.
Yeah? Hi. No. No, no.
We were just out buying some
stuff for the baby. What's up?
Seriously?
Okay.
Thanks for calling.
What is it?
That was our lawyer.
Libby rejected us as parents.
Why?
Because we're Mexican.
What?! Why, I...
that's discrimination.
It's illegal. We could have her arrested.
It's her baby.
She can do whatever the hell
she wants to with it.
Damn it.
No! No, you don't just
toss people aside
because of the color of their skin.
We tossed those birth mothers aside
because of their appearance.
Well, that's different.
Why?
Because I've read the constitution,
and it does not
protect ugly people.
Let's not fight about it.
It's over.
Let's just move on to the next one.
No. No, no, no.
I want that woman's baby,
and I'm gonna get it.
And just how are you
gonna go about doing that?
Well, first of all, I'm gonna
show her one of our tax returns.
Once she sees
how much money we have,
I have a hunch we're gonna
look a whole lot whiter.
Hey, Veronica.
Hi, Donovan!
My, he's getting big.
How old is he?
He just turned 5.
Oh, wow, he's such a big boy.
Yeah.
Hey, you know,
breast-feeding on this schedule
must be a real hassle.
I remember I used to express
my milk into a bottle.
Made my life so much easier.
Is there a problem,
Lynette?
The people in this office
feel a little...
concerned...
that you're nursing a boy
of Donovan's age.
Do they know breast milk
boosts the immune system,
it's loaded with vitamins,
and in the third world,
it's not unusual to nurse babies
up to the age of 6?
Yeah, well, in the third world,
they don't have juice boxes.
This is Donovan's decision.
He will tell me when
he's ready to stop nursing.
Come on, baby birds
don't jump out of the nest.
They need to be pushed.
Did you also know
that breast milk is thought
to raise I.Q. scores?
Yeah, maybe if you had
weaned your kids a bit later,
they'd be more civilized.
Ouch.
I will not be judged
by you or anyone else,
And if people don't like
my breast-feeding,
they can talk
to my lawyer.
And then
she took the salad bowl,
put it on the floor
and said,
"If you wanna act like a pig,
you can eat like a pig. "
You know, I never thought
I'd have such a good time
hanging out with my girlfriend
and her husband.
Yeah, well, believe me,
behind all the laughs,
there's still plenty of bitterness and resentment.
Oh, really?
Yeah.
Hey, what do you say you and I clear the table
and bring on dessert?
No, no. I got it, I got it.
No, honey,
you're not gonna do anything.
You're in a wheelchair
for a reason, okay?
Why don't you let Karl and I
do the dishes?
All right, but if I catch you
guys in there talking about me,
you're gonna be the one in a wheelchair.
Oh, really?
Yeah. Mmm.
Yeah?
Well, I think maybe the dishes
can wait for a second.
Just a second?
Yeah, just a second.
What the hell?
What's the matter?
Jeez, uh, we got a leak.
Oh.
I'll sop up the water.
Why don't you see go see
the guy across the street?
He's a plumber,
in the gray house.
All right.
I'll be right back.
His name's Delfino.
Where's he going?
Oh, we've got a bit
of a plumbing emergency.
So you sent him
over to Mike's?
Oh, my God.
I am such an idiot!
I wasn't even thinking. Oh, God!
Karl!
There's just
so much water here.
What were you thinking?
Hi, Mr. Delfino? My name's Ron.
My girlfriend is Susan Mayer.
You know,
from across the street?
Yeah, yeah...
I know her.
We've got
kind of a burst pipe.
Okay, um...
Come on in
while I get my tools.
And you can call me Mike.
Oh! Ugh!
Oh, ah, okay.
I made it.
So... Mike, have you, uh,
have you known Susan long?
A year and a half.
Ah! Ooh!
Didn't she mention
we dated?
No, no, she didn't.
She... she didn't.
Oh!
Can you excuse me, please?
That smarts. Uhh!
Liar!
I take it you met Mike.
Yeah, I did.
Please,
please let me explain.
No, just let go of me.
Ohh!
I'm sorry.
Okay.
Here, come on,
let me help you.
Hey, get away from her! Are you okay?
I'm fine!
What the hell is the matter with you?
Hey, that was an accident!
That didn't look
like an accident.
Okay, Mike, just... it's okay.
Just go home.
Yeah, go home, Mike.
You touch her like that again,
you're gonna be dealing with me.
You might wanna
get out of my face.
Or what?
Okay.
Ron, what are you doing?
Oh, my God!
Guys, stop it. Stop it, right now!
All right, all right.
I can't believe
I wasted my time with you.
You've just been
leading me on!
You're obviously
still in love with this guy.
All right, I'm done.
No, Ron, don't go!
Don't call me.
Oh, Ron!
What the hell
is wrong with you?
I thought
he was hurting you.
Well, he wasn't!
And now
my boyfriend is gone.
Thank you very much.
Okay, put the pole
as your friend, okay?
Push your boobs up against it.
Oh, I can't. They're new.
Well, do something,
Cecile.
I'm losing my wood
down here.
Wow!
That's a kickin' outfit.
Well, thank you, sweetie.
I clean up well
for a wetback, don't I?
Look, I'm not
some sort of racist.
I just want what's best
for my baby girl.
I mean, why should I settle
for middle-class Mexicans
when I know I can find
rich white folks to adopt her?
Please. Do I look
middle-class to you?
Well, you didn't seem all that
rich in Mr. Beale's office.
I mean, when I brought up
the idea of gifts,
your husband, he acted like
he couldn't even afford a Harley.
So is that what it's gonna take
to change your mind... a gift?
Fine. What do you want?
I don't know.
You like jewelry?
Well, here.
Are these real diamonds?
Honey, the one in the center
is 3 karats.
I never touched
a real diamond before.
Well, my husband and I
can expose you
to a lot of nice new things.
Well, only if I let you have my baby.
Well, like they say,
there's no such thing
as a free lunch.
Okay.
Really?
Just like that?
Just like that.
Of course, you probably shouldn't tell
the lawyer about our understanding,
because then we'll have to deal
with percentages and all that.
I always hated math.
What's wrong?
You never gave a crap
that we were Mexican, did you?
Not really.
So why put me through this?
Because I thought,
If it looked like
you weren't gonna get my baby,
that you might be
just a bit more generous.
Wow. You're a lot smarter
than I thought.
I'm smarter
than everybody thinks.
Where's my mom?
I'm thirsty.
Oh, I'm sorry, honey.
Your mom... is in her office
on a conference call,
and she's busy, so you're just
gonna have to wait, okay?
What's that?
That's chocolate milk.
I shouldn't be having it.
Have you ever had any?
Mnh-Mnh.
Follow me.
Here. Go ahead, try it.
Come on, you'll really like it.
I promise.
Come on, yeah.
All the grown-ups
are drinking it.
Yeah, that's good.
Just... chug it on down.
Good.
You like that?
Would you like dessert
or another glass of wine?
Oh, no, thank you.
I have to run. Just the check.
I have a charity event
this weekend,
and I have to find a cocktail dress
before the store closes.
But everything
was just yummy.
Looks good on your ass.
Uh, hey, Mrs. Van De Kamp.
What do you think you're doing?
You're supposed to be grounded.
I'm, uh, buying a belt.
With what?
You don't have any money.
You took that out of my purse.
Give that back.
We are going home. Wait till
I tell the judge about
you stealing my credit cards
and sneaking off.
It's gonna do wonders for
your little emancipation case.
I don't think you're gonna
let this get to the court.
Oh, and why is that?
Because then I'd be forced
to testify about my childhood.
So? You had one of the loveliest
childhoods I've ever known.
You sure about that?
'Cause I'm starting
to remember some abuse.
Andrew, the judge is not seriously
gonna believe that I beat you.
Oh, I'm not talking
about that kind of abuse.
You know, it's funny...
the angrier I get, the more of these
repressed memories start to come up.
You can't be serious.
Like, touching me in places
you shouldn't have...
No one is ever gonna
believe a word of that.
Yeah, well,
you know how people are.
They might say
that they believe you,
but...
they'll always wonder.
So if I were you...
I'd back the hell off.
Come on, Justin.
I'm gonna buy you
something pretty.
Justin!
On second thought,
I will have
another glass of wine.
You can leave the bottle.
Yeah?
Hi, it's Bree Van De Kamp.
I didn't know who else to call,
and, well, I'm in a bit
of a situation.
Well...
How did you
get stuck like that?
I would rather
not discuss it right now.
Man, the other security guys
are not gonna believe this.
Do you mind?
I'd prefer if you...
...didn't.
Your son threatened you
with "repressed memories"?
Oh, my God,
he is seriously twisted.
I gotta meet this kid.
You sound like
you're impressed.
I sorta am.
Sounds like you're definitely
raising an alpha male.
I'm raising a monster,
is what I'm raising.
It's no wonder I drink.
I don't know why I said that.
Maybe it's true.
No, it makes it sound like I think
I have a problem, and I don't.
Look, I don't wanna get
into a fight or anything,
But you passed out
in a department store,
and in my way of thinking,
that is a problem.
Tonight was
a very unusual situation.
I wish you could've
known me when...
Rex was alive
and my kids were young,
and everything was...
the way
it was supposed to be.
I think you really
would've liked me... so much.
I like you just fine.
Really?
Because I don't.
Mom?
Andrew?
Caleb?
Hey, Danielle.
What are you doing here?
Happy birthday.
You really
have to go home.
If my mom knew you were here,
she'd freak.
Don't you want to wear it?
No, I don't. Now please leave.
I can help you with it.
No! Didn't you hear me, you freak?! Leave!
What's wrong?
You can tell everyone
in the office to relax.
He won't
take my milk anymore.
Already?
I mean, I'm sorry.
Yeah, I bet.
I mean, I'm not naive.
I just didn't think
it would be so soon.
Oh, sweetie...
I know that we wanna keep them
young as long as we can,
but kids grow up.
They just do.
I know.
If that's not bad enough,
now I'm gonna get fat again.
Huh?
Breast-feeding was the only
thing that kept the weight off.
Every mealtime was like
doing 30 minutes of cardio.
Now I'm gonna have
to join a gym!
Wow, that is...
really a bummer.
It is.
It really is.
Hey, uh,
Julie let me in.
I can see that.
So, what, did you run out
of strangers to beat up
on the street, and you're going
house to house now?
I feel really awful
about what happened.
If you don't wanna be
my boyfriend, fine.
Don't beat up the only guy who
wants to volunteer for the job.
Look,
I know I overreacted.
But come on,
the way he was yelling at you?
I deserved it, believe me.
After what I did...
God,
this is such a mess.
He won't even
return my phone calls.
What'd you do?
I said something to Dr. Ron
before the operation,
and it just...
devastated him.
What?
I can't tell you.
Yeah, you can.
You can tell me anything.
You know that.
Mom, um, phone call.
It's Dr. Ron.
Oh?
Um...
I need to take this.
You, um, you wanna
talk about this later?
No.
No, not really. Um...
What's the point?
Hi.
At that precise moment
as Dr. Hanson Mills was cutting
yet another umbilical cord,
other ties were being severed
all over town.
Like the one
between a child and the mother
who didn't want him
to grow up so quickly.
Or the one
between a case of fine wine
and the housewife who hadn't wanted
to admit that she had a problem.
Or the one between a woman
and the boyfriend
who couldn't forgive
her betrayal.
The choice to separate
from what we love is painful...
Hey. How's my girl today?
How are both of my girls?
The only thing worse...
We're doing good.
We're doing real good.
...is when someone we've trusted
makes the choice for us.
Previously on "Desperate Housewives"...
Well, if Libby here likes
us as much as we like her,
we should just go ahead and
move to adopt her baby girl.
Who's the father?
Honestly, I don't know.
Carlos and Gaby made a deal.
I did remarry my ex,
but it was only because
he has great health insurance.
Susan made amends.
You know, I never thought
I'd have such a good time
hanging out with my girlfriend
and her husband.
And Mike...
Didn't she mention we dated?
... made a confession...
Liar! You've just been leading me on!
You're obviously still in love
with this guy!
... of his own.
On her first day of sobriety,
Bree Van De Kamp found an old cork,
which reminded her just how
much she craved Chablis.
So she called her sponsor,
who came over with a DVD
which they watched
till her craving had passed.
Five days later, after she
developed a thirst for Merlot,
Peter arrived with a deck of cards.
The next week, he brought
over Chinese takeout
because Bree had told him
she was consumed by thoughts
of vintage Chardonnay.
By her 20th day of sobriety, Bree had
stopped thinking about alcohol altogether
because her thoughts were
now centered elsewhere.
Hmm...
I'm curious, Peter. What is the
easiest way to overcome addiction?
Oh, some folks try shock therapy.
Other use, uh, hypnosis.
But taking it one day at a time
still makes the most sense to me.
Why?
I don't know. I guess I'm just
impatient to get on with my life.
What are you doing?
I was just giving you a little kiss.
Why?
Well, it's just my way of saying thank you
for everything you've done for
me over the past few weeks.
What's... wrong?
This is gonna seem like it's
coming out of left field,
but in addition to being
a recovering alcoholic,
I'm also a member of S.A.
Sex addicts anonymous.
Oh. And that's a-a real thing?
Yes. And sex is as much an
addiction for me as booze.
That's why when you turn me on like that,
it's a bit of a problem.
It was just a peck on the cheek.
It doesn't matter. The slightest
touch gets my juices flowing.
So, how long has it been since you...
A year.
They have this rule... plant, pet, person.
If I can keep a plant alive, you know,
then I can move on to a pet.
And if I can make that work,
then I can start dating again.
So how are you doing?
I'm on my fourth ficus.
Oh.
See?
I think you can handle affection
better than you give yourself credit for.
I'm sorry.
Um... I think I should go.
Really?
Yeah.
But... but... you forgot your shirt!
Keep it.
Though she didn't know it,
Bree had answered her own question.
The easiest way to overcome one addiction...
is to replace it with another.
2x18:
Everybody Says Don't
Temptation...
it's the name of a well-known establishment
on the outskirts of Fairview.
Its clientele is devoted.
Everyone who goes there
wants to get their hands on something.
And when they cross a line...
Hey! I warned you, pal.
...they are punished...
as a certain married couple
was about to discover.
Hi.
You want a lap dance?
Uh...
No, thanks. No.
I sure hope Libby likes this camera.
Well, why wouldn't she? It's
exactly what she asked for,
the most expensive one in the store.
You know, I'm telling you, Carlos,
I'm getting really tired of kissing her ass.
The woman is giving us her baby.
We'll kiss whatever needs kissing.
What the hell are you guys doing here?
Uh, we brought you this gift,
and you said that you didn't
want us coming by your house...
Thanks, but I'm working, so you gotta go.
Look, we spent a lot of money on that.
The least you can do is open it
so we can bask in your happy expression.
Is there a problem here?
No, we're just talking.
Everything's fine.
Carlos Solis. This is my wife, Gabrielle.
We're friends of Libby's.
Oh, hey, I'm Frank, Libby's boyfriend.
Libby, you didn't tell
us you had a boyfriend.
Didn't I? I thought I had.
What's that, a present for our baby?
I'm sorry, did you just say "our" baby?
Yeah. It's our first.
Hey!
What's for lunch?
Omelettes. You want me to make you one?
No, thank you. I'll just pick at yours.
I didn't know you still had a key, Dad.
Of course I do.
I have to watch out for
my two favorite ladies.
Try the cheese.
That's the best part.
You mean, two of your three favorite ladies.
You know, when you add in Edie.
Right! Of course.
And speaking of Edie, I have some big news.
I finally did it. I popped the question.
Oh! Congratulations, Dad!
Yeah... congratulations.
Um, what happened to waiting six months?
Edie and I aren't
getting married tomorrow.
It takes months to plan
a classy wedding, you know?
Remember ours, hmm? You had
to have it outdoors, huh?
Ugh. It poured.
I could have murdered that weatherman.
We were all crammed under
this little gazebo thing.
It was hysterical.
I thought the whole wedding day was ruined.
I loved it! It felt spontaneous.
All our friends gathered
close around us, hmm?
Remember?
You said it was the happiest
day of your life.
Just like you marrying Edie
will be the happiest day of her life.
Yeah. Right.
Her, too.
Toodles.
Oh, hi.
Hello.
Andrew said it was all right
for me to get a cream soda.
Uh, sure. Help yourself.
There's also frosted glasses in the freezer.
Can is fine, but thank you.
Oh, and, uh, I left a list for you
of the witnesses we'll be deposing.
It's, uh, there on the counter.
Hi.
Hey.
I know that you're still
angry with me, and, um...
I wanted to tell you that I have, um...
joined a recovery program.
A.A.
I just wanted you to know that...
and to tell you I'm sorry.
You are...
a real friend, and I value your honesty.
Oh, I don't wanna be mad anymore.
And I'm so happy to hear all that,
and I am so proud of you.
Oh, thanks,
but I'm not really out of the woods yet.
I still have this whole court
case hanging over my head.
I heard about that.
Andrew's asking to be emancipated?
Yes, and his lawyer is taking
depositions now
to see if I am a fit parent.
Oh.
And considering that mishap
that I had with your kids,
I, uh, I imagine he'll
be anxious to talk to you.
Well, it makes sense, I guess.
Yeah.
Do you have any idea what you might say?
I, um...
I'll focus on your good qualities.
I could not ask for anything more.
Thanks.
See you around, I hope.
All right.
That's... not why you
came to apologize, is it?
What do you mean?
To soften me up for the deposition?
Of course not.
Um...
I just want you to understand something.
Andrew is making accusations...
false accusations, saying that I abused him,
all because I wouldn't let
him have his trust fund early
so he could buy a car.
I mean, can you blame me for wanting to know
if I have your support?
And...
so... what,
you want me to lie? Make you look good?
I actually don't want anything of the sort.
Good.
Because when I give my deposition,
I'm going to tell the truth.
To what do I owe this pleasure?
I want you to look at something.
Myra Holt is talking to Paul Young,
chatting away with him as though
he were any other neighbor.
Now I told her he killed my sister.
I mentioned it to her six
months ago when we were
standing in the express line at the market.
But still, there she is, yakking away.
Oh, Mike.
I'm afraid people's memories
aren't what they used to be.
What do you want, Felicia?
I wanna see how good your memory is,
if you recall a certain
promise you made to me.
I am not gonna kill him.
Why not? Give me one good reason.
Because things have changed.
How? My sister still lies
rotting in the ground.
So does Deirdre. No, I don't
see how anything's changed at all.
You're just gonna have to let this go.
Sounds to me as though
someone's let go of his rage.
Maybe I have.
Well, I haven't.
That bitch of a stripper lied to us.
The father's totally in the dark.
He clearly wants to keep the baby.
Mr. Solis, if the father wants
to assert his rights here,
there's nothing we can do.
I'll find you another baby. I promise.
I don't want another baby. I want this one!
Oh, honey, he's right, okay.
That trashy girl has been
lying to us from the get-go.
Let's just walk away while
we can. It's not worth it.
Look, don't get cold feet
now, Gaby, please. All right?
Let's just pay Frank the way we paid Libby
and then bring the baby home.
Wait, wait, wait.
You paid Libby?
You said we could give her gifts.
Everybody loves getting cash.
I could probably be disbarred
for even listening to this.
I cannot condone baby-buying!
And I sure as hell can't be part of it.
Oh, Mr. Beale, come on.
No, no, hear me out.
If you are determined to
go down this dark road,
and unbeknownst to me steal this...
paternal rights waiver
that's sitting on my desk,
and have this Frank guy sign
both sides and date the top,
I can't be part of that, either.
Hmm.
Okay, I-I'm gonna go to Dad's.
Oh, wait! Why don't you let me walk with you?
Uh, shouldn't you be resting?
No! I'm fine.
The doctor said I should actually
keep my blood flowing.
Well, do you have to
while we walk over to Edie's?
I just... I don't wanna
risk you running into Dad.
Okay.
You guys have just been so chummy lately,
and... this whole flirting thing
is kind of freaking me out.
Wait a second, we're... we're not flirting.
Mom, you fed him eggs with your fork.
Okay, yes,
I am closer to your father
than I have been in the past.
The bitter hatred's now settled
into a respectful disgust.
That's the kind of thing
most children of divorce dream about.
Hey, Edie. What's all this stuff for?
Oh, hi! Don't tell anyone,
but I'm planning a huge surprise for Karl.
A surprise?
Yeah, I'm putting together
an engagement party
tomorrow afternoon.
Oh, cool.
But that's not the surprise.
Actually, it's gonna be a surprise wedding.
I know. My Pilates teacher
got ordained over the internet.
The, uh, church of the
divine something or other.
I'm not sure. Anyway, it's all legal.
And, well, just one more day
before I make an honest
man out of your Daddy.
Oh! You're so sweet.
Thank you so much for your good wishes.
Oh. No, Edie, wait. Um, no, it's just that...
you know, I was married to Karl,
and I used to... try to surprise him,
and he would always, always, always say...
"no, Susan. Don't surprise
me. I don't like it. "
Whatever. I'm doing it,
so keep your trap shut.
Now if you'll excuse me,
I've gotta go and buy a wedding dress.
Oh, and by the way, I'll be wearing white,
so that'll be a surprise
for everybody.
I don't know why I have
to get dragged into this.
What happened with my kids
has nothing to do with Bree's
situation with Andrew.
Sit.
Well, it's my understanding
that real harm could have
come to your children
as a direct result of your friend's behavior.
I'm sorry, Mr. Bormanis,
but I'm not gonna testify.
It just doesn't feel right to me.
Well, this isn't the first time
someone's felt the way you do.
So this isn't the first
time I've had to say that
if you refuse to give a deposition
of your own accord,
I'll compel you to give one.
But I'm sure I won't have to.
You're saying Bree did this?
While under the influence.
I understand your reluctance
to turn on a friend,
but this isn't about you.
It's about Andrew.
Don't you think he's suffered enough?
How much are you gonna give him?
I figured we could start with forty.
Thousand?
He's a bouncer in a strip
club. Offer him eight.
He's not going to sell his baby for $8,000.
Are we talking about the same idiot?
I think for $8,000, you throw in a kidney.
I'm not gonna blow this by bargain hunting.
You know, that's your problem, Carlos.
Remember when you bought
your car? You paid sticker.
Nobody pays sticker!
Okay, and what's the sticker price on a child, huh?
Tell me that.
I'm thinking twelve.
Frank, you have to sign the paper.
I made a deal with these people.
A deal?
This isn't a used car we're
talking about. It's our baby.
Before you screw this up,
just remember that I can
go to the cops and tell them
about the pot farm you have
going on in our basement.
It's just a couple plants.
Yeah, I don't do it for profits.
Hobby, mostly.
Oh, come on, Frank. You know
you would be a lousy father.
It's my kid! And I have a right
to mess her up if I want.
And if you go near the
police, I'll tell 'em how
you've been stealing all
those tips from Sheila.
Okay, we're done.
Gaby, Gaby, no, just... hold on.
Now maybe there's a way that
we can work this out together.
There is nothing to work out.
If Frank is not on board
with this, it's over.
Wait! Uh... it doesn't matter what he wants.
Why not?
Because it's not your baby.
That's a lie.
What if I took a paternity
test? Will that shut you up?
Wait, if it's not Frank's, then whose is it?
I'm not sure.
All's I know is,
I got pregnant right after
I worked at the Calgary rodeo,
and I was very popular there.
So what are you saying, you
screwed a bunch of cowboys?
You have your hobbies...
and I have mine.
You think this is funny?
Oh, don't you get it?
We just got our baby back.
Um...
Well, you take care now.
Ahem. Yeah.
Hi.
I got, uh, your message
that you wanted to see me
before the meeting started.
Yeah, I did. Um, there's someone
I'd like to introduce you to.
Bree, this is Donna.
Donna, this is Bree.
What's up?
Hi.
Donna is gonna be your new sponsor.
I, um, I don't want a new sponsor.
I'm... I'm very comfortable working with you.
Look, this was always just
a temporary arrangement.
And given what happened the other night,
I think it's best if we just end this now.
Peter, all we did was kiss.
We'd be kidding ourselves
if we didn't think that
whatever's between us isn't
going to affect our recovery.
It's not a good time for
change in my life, Peter.
Terrible things are happening.
I'm headed to court.
I need your support now more than ever.
You'll have support, Bree.
It just won't be mine.
But, Peter...
Oh, Bree could never have done that!
I'm just telling you what the lawyer said.
So you think Bree punched Andrew in the face?
'Cause I don't.
I don't either, but on the other hand,
she spanked my kids, she
lied about her drinking
and I once saw her bitch
slap her mother-in-law.
So I'm torn.
Well, I'm siding with Bree.
How can you be so sure?
We have Andrew saying that it's
systematic physical abuse.
And then we have Bree saying
it's Andrew wanting to be emancipated
so he can get at his trust
fund so he can buy a car.
How are we supposed to know the real truth?
Because I remember being 17.
And I would've done a hell of a lot more
than punch myself in the eye to get a car.
Karl!
Karl, stop! Stop!
Oh! It's an emergency.
Just calm down. What's going on?
Edie is gonna marry you tomorrow.
What?
She's planned this whole secret wedding.
It's a surprise.
God, I hate surprises!
I know. I told her that.
I said, "he always, always hates surprises. "
All right, don't get yourself
all worked up here.
Put our heads together. We'll
come up with something.
So the thing you gotta know about me
is my style is proactive.
I don't hold your hand if you go on a bender.
I believe in behavior modification.
Hmm. Some muffins?
Oh. Oh, that's okay. I-I'm not big on snacks.
You should also know...
I'm not a lesbian.
Oh!
Well, good for you.
Well, see, if I was, the program
wouldn't let me be your sponsor.
Not great for your recovery
if we get tangled up in a little somethin'.
So, um, whatever vibe you might be getting,
that's all on you.
Um, Donna...
I I really appreciate everything
that you've been doing for me,
but I think I was really making some progress
with Peter as my sponsor.
And I was thinking...
All right, stop right there!
You're fixating on Peter.
Well, I just really feel like
I'm jeopardizing my recovery
by switching...
You're making excuses.
See, I have a 99% success rate as a sponsor
because I have 0% tolerance
for people who lie to themselves.
Now come on.
Come on? Where are we going?
Hiking. There's nothing like it
to take your mind off booze.
I got it!
I'll just be the woman.
I'll say I want a big wedding.
You know, the church, the big ballroom,
smushing cake in her face...
it'll take months to plan.
That's great.
And of course, I'll have to tell her
you're the one who ruined the surprise.
You're gonna make me take the hit?
Yeah.
Hey, guys. What you doing out here?
Uh, just talking.
Oh, well, come on in. I've
got something to show you.
Oh, no, that's okay.
Come on! You'll love this.
Wait until I leave to tell her,
'cause she's gonna kill me.
Well, I should go.
I'm not gonna scream or cry
or pound your faces in with a mallet,
which, Lord knows, is my right.
But what I will say is that you two
are the most reprehensible
excuses for human beings
that I have ever met!
Do you have anything to add?
Right. What the hell.
Hey, Mrs. Scavo.
That's a... that's a sweet ride.
Yeah, you think so?
Why don't you come over here for a second?
I'd like to pick your brain.
You're the demographic that
my client is interested in,
so you'd actually be doing me a favor
if you drove it around for a couple hours,
and tell me what you thought. Do you mind?
Are you kidding me?
I can't believe you are old enough to drive.
I still remember when you were 10 years old.
I paid you a dollar to rake our leaves.
Yeah.
Yeah, you were pretty cheap.
Is this set up for MP3?
Uh, all the bells and whistles.
But listen...
I really wanted to tell you how sorry I am.
Hmm?
Your lawyer came to see me.
I'm going to be deposed.
It's going to be hard for me...
Yeah. Yeah, I know.
You just have to remember
she's a different person when she drinks.
She must be.
It's hard for me to imagine the Bree
I know capable of hurting you.
Yeah.
Do you have the keys?
Oh. Sure.
Anyway, I just...
I feel so guilty that this
all went on in your house,
right under our nose.
So if there is anything
I can do to help you...
Well, can you get a discount on these?
Um...
actually, yeah. One of the perks.
Even so, it's a little out of the
price range of a high school student.
Well, if you tell my lawyer the truth,
I don't think money's gonna be a problem.
Hi. What's going on?
Edie wants to discuss
our little... deception.
Exactly how ugly is this gonna get?
How long does it take to shut a door?
I can forgive your trickery.
I can forgive the humiliation.
But what I can't forgive
is the complete and utter
lack of faith in me!
I mean, having Susan get married
for insurance was my idea!
Okay, so if I'd known that everything
had gotten all screwed up,
of course I would've agreed.
Look, Edie, in retrospect...
yes, we didn't think.
We didn't handle this the way
mature adults should have.
He's right. We behaved like children...
naughty, stupid children.
Well, that makes me feel better
that you could admit that.
Because... when naughty children misbehave,
they know that they're gonna
get punished, don't they?
Punished?
At this point,
I'd like to point out that,
uh, it was Karl who proposed.
Karl.
You are gonna throw me an elaborate wedding.
Yes, of course.
Anything, baby.
How elaborate?
Well, figure out exactly what
it is that you could afford,
and triple it.
As for you...
Okay, now remember, I'm broke.
I'm well aware of your church mouse status.
I don't intend to lift a finger
during the planning and execution
of this crushingly expensive wedding.
No. No, of course not.
And anything I can do to help...
uh, you know, I would...
I could help with the engagement party.
How's that?
Well, I wasn't planning on inviting you.
But...
I will need a bartender.
Oh, oh, and, um...
make sure you come in through the back door.
You're just in time.
Mrs. Scavo has been sworn in,
so we're all ready to start.
Hey.
Hi.
All right, we are now on the record.
Okay.
Isn't it true that while your
children were in Bree's care,
that she passed out drunk
and allowed them to wander off
to a downtown business district?
My kids don't wander. They scurry, like rats.
Excuse me?
Do you know a rat can fit through a hole
the size of a quarter?
Anyway, my children have
that trick down, too.
Mrs. Scavo, are you saying
that you don't hold Mrs.
Van De Kamp responsible
for endangering your children?
No, I don't hold her responsible.
Bree Van De Kamp and I have
known each other a long time.
I trust her completely.
She's a wonderful friend
and a fantastic mother.
She puts the rest of us to shame.
She's lying! Are you gonna let
her get away with this crap?
Please.
Do you consider Mrs. Van De
Kamp to have a drinking problem?
No.
Then why did you line empty wine bottles
up on her front stoop?
I was helping Bree with her recycling.
Do I need to remind you
of the potential consequences of perjury?
No, you don't. In fact, I hate liars.
Hello?
Peter. Hi, it's Bree.
Hey, Bree.
You know, um, if you feel like
you're gonna need a drink,
you should call Donna.
No! No, I-I don't feel like I'm gonna drink.
And if I did, I certainly would call Donna.
I mean, she and I are just...
we're just really clicking.
Oh, that's good. So why are you calling?
I know it's really late notice,
but a friend of mine, uh,
got engaged and she's throwing a party,
and I thought, um, maybe you'd like to come.
Bree...
Well, you're not my sponsor anymore,
so I assume this is allowable.
I mean, it's just a casual get-together.
And they're having sushi.
You do like sushi, don't you?
Bree...
Okay, Peter, I just really...
need us to be friends.
When I'm with you, I'm not myself,
which is a good thing.
I can... I can relax when I'm with you
in a way that I can't
when I'm with other people.
With them, I have to pretend
that I have it all together,
but...
you know that I don't, so
it's just so much easier.
Come on, it's just a...
it's just a dumb old party.
Bree...
do not call me again.
Oh!
Paul! I am so glad you made it.
I appreciate the invitation, Edie.
Although, frankly, I'm a
little surprised to get it
considering how people in this
neighborhood feel about me.
Oh. You know me. I like to be inclusive.
Ooh! It's heavy.
Uh, unh-unh. This is flat.
I think I'd like, um...
a Rusty Nail.
A what now?
It's a cocktail,
well, I'm not really sure what's in it.
But it sounds obscure and
complicated, so chop-chop.
Be right there.
Hey, hey. Put that down. We gotta go.
Our birth mother just went into labor.
What?
That's fantastic!
Yeah, can you believe it? We're gonna be parents.
I'll go get the car. Come on.
We were supposed to have four weeks.
She promised to me the baby wasn't
due for four more weeks.
We don't have anything! We don't...
we don't have diapers,
and we don't have the stuff babies drink.
Formula.
Exactly. We're not ready.
You know, this is a total inconvenience.
Welcome to parenthood. Come on.
This is your father's bartender bible.
See if you can find a recipe for a Rusty Nail.
Okay.
Um, Mom?
Where'd you find that?
It was stuck in here between
a Pink Squirrel and a Pisco Sour.
Oh.
Well, why is your father keeping this?
Why do you think?
Hey, Susie.
Karl, this marriage...
our marriage, this fake marriage,
that's what it is, right? Fake.
What are you talking about?
What's this?
Nothing.
Yeah?
Mm-hmm.
Okay, then, repeat after me.
"Our marriage is fake,
"and I'm going to marry
the woman I really love...
Edie Britt. "
If that's what you want me to say.
No, no, no, no! It's not about
what I want you to say.
You have to want to say
that you want to marry Edie.
Don't worry about this, Susie.
Why are you hanging on to that?
I need to look at it from time to time.
Why?
Consider it my punishment.
For screwing up the best thing
that ever happened to me.
Oh. Oh, no, no, no.
This is not happening.
No, wha... mmm. Mmm!
Oh, Karl! Oh! Will you...
Are you crazy?!
Just tell me what to do, Susie.
If you want me to marry Edie, I will.
You want me to call off
the wedding, I'll do it.
I'll do whatever you want.
I'm putty.
Karl! Whoa!
What are you doing?
I'm, just, uh, putting away some coats.
Oh.
Well, it's time to open my presents.
Let's go.
Oh, hello.
Hi.
Hi. Um, I need some advice
from a professional.
I'd like to get stinking drunk.
Do you have anything that can
accomplish that in a hurry?
I forgot the Lamaze book in my purse!
Oh, forget it. Come on.
Let's go. We'll wing it.
Oh, we missed it!
The kid just slipped right out.
Are you family?
They're the parents.
Would you like to help?
No, thanks.
You guys look like you got it covered.
Oh, are you sure, honey?
Come on, Gaby.
I just, um...
I I don't wanna do anything to screw it up.
She won't break.
Here.
Okay.
Hi.
Oh, honey, you were right.
About what?
It was all worth it.
Serving bowls.
Just what I needed, Lynette.
There's a gift receipt taped
to the bottom of the box.
Oh. Thank God!
Okay, the next one is from Felicia.
I do hope you like it.
Oh, you know what they say...
good things come in small packages.
What is it?
Teeth?
Dentures.
They were my dear sister Martha's.
I'm sure none of you knew,
but she had orthodontic issues
from the time she was a child.
Oh.
Thank you.
I know it's an unconventional
gift for an engagement party,
but you and Martha were
such close friends, Edie.
I wanted you to have something truly personal
to remember her by,
since she left us so... abruptly.
You know,
when Paul Young strangled
her, crushed her windpipe
and buried her alive next to
a garbage-strewn hiking trail.
Felicia, uh... I think you've had enough.
I do apologize if I've offended anyone,
but... while you all are chitchatting
and eating these gummy hors d'oeuvres,
just remember...
you're in the company of a murderer.
Bree? Bree.
Why didn't you call Donna?
Hmm.
I don't need Donna.
I need you.
You know, I don't even like redheads.
Okay, it's my turn.
Shh. In a minute.
Come on, you're hogging her.
Tell me! You tell
me who it is, Libby.
Are you drunk?
Who is he, Libby? Hmm?
I got to know.
I already told you, he's just some rodeo guy.
I don't even remember his name.
Liar!
What are you doing?
I am gonna light myself on fire.
He's gonna light himself
on fire with coffee liqueur?
Would not have been my choice.
Tell me his name, or I'm gonna do it!
Frank, you're being an idiot.
It was Dale, okay? It was Dale.
Security to maternity.
My brother Dale? He's a kid!
Well, he's 19, Frank.
He knows which end is up.
Wait, what is she saying?
There's a father.
Hey! Hey!
No.
Leave me alone!
I'm not giving up the baby.
Let's get him out of here.
No! No!
Security to O.B. Security to O.B., stat.
What the hell are you doing?
Taking our baby home.
She's not ours. The papers
aren't valid anymore.
She has a father.
Do you really wanna leave
this beautiful little girl
with that white trash freak show?!
Huh?
Well, come on, then.
Where?
Maternity. Maternity.
All right.
Hurry up!
I'm hurrying.
Man, there's a lot of straps on this thing!
How does this thing go in?
Read the instructions!
"Pass strap 'a' through strap 'b,'
making sure that the harness
clip is at chest level. "
Well, which damn one is the harness clip?
That is after the baby is in.
You have to connect it to the car first!
I told you we should've got an S.U.V.!
Okay, stop yelling! This is very complicated.
Oh, for God's sakes. Just take the baby.
Wow.
We're good to go.
Give me the baby.
You know this isn't gonna end well.
You know, they're just gonna
try and take her back.
Maybe. But we don't have
to make it easy for them.
Gaby, I...
Look, just buckle up!
Temptation comes to all of us.
Whether or not we succumb
depends on our ability
to recognize its disguise.
Sometimes it arrives in
the form of an old flame,
flickering back to life.
Or a new friend
who could end up being so much more.
Or a young child
who awakens feelings we didn't know we had.
And so we give in to temptation,
all the while knowing come morning,
we'll have to suffer the consequences.
Previously on "Desperate Housewives"...
Sounds to me as if someone's let go of his rage.
Maybe I have.
Well, I haven't.
Felicia took matters into her own hands.
You want me to call off the wedding, I'll do it.
I'll do whatever you want.
Karl put the ball in Susan's court...
With your D.U.I. charge, it could get ugly.
While Andrew tried to take Bree to court...
There's a father.
He's a kid!
Gabrielle and Carlos took the baby...
The papers aren't valid anymore.
Do you really wanna leave this beautiful little girl
with that white trash freak show?
...and ran with it.
Louisa Pate believed in the power of shame.
As a teacher, she had found
the best way to control unruly students
was to instill a strong sense of shame...
in their parents.
I left Trisha alone with the school
hamster for only five minutes.
In this box is all that's left of Patches.
For show and tell,
Timmy decided to bring in something
from your husband's collection of nazi memorabilia.
Billy's been threatening to beat up
the other kids for their milk money.
We found the proceeds in his cubby.
Of course, Mrs. Pate also knew
when it came to unruly children,
some parents had more reason to be ashamed...
than others.
So, um...
your message said that Parker had been
involved in some sort of serious incident.
What... what kind of incident?
Yesterday afternoon,
Parker offered a cookie to Cindy Lou Peeples
if she would show him her vagina.
What kind of cookie?
What does that matter?
Oh, it doesn't.
I'm just stalling
because I am completely mortified.
The kids were in a broom closet.
Our janitor walked in on them
just as Cindy was lifting up her pinafore.
Oh, my goodness.
I'm sure you've noticed
how obsessive Parker can be.
A certain subject will catch his interest,
and that's all he'll talk about
for weeks and weeks.
Oh, right. That happened with dinosaurs.
Oh, yes, we all remember his dinosaur phase.
More fondly now than ever.
So you think that now he's obsessed with...?
What's underneath the pinafore, yes.
Look, I think he's just developed
a normal curiosity about the human body.
You need to talk to him.
Remind him what's appropriate
and what isn't.
Of course. I will talk to him.
I'll talk to him till I'm blue in the face.
I promise.
Take care.
Yes, Louisa Pate believed in the power of shame.
She also believed, when someone has that power...
So, Mrs. Peeples,
you'll never guess what your daughter
is willing to do for a gingersnap.
... it's a shame not to use it.
2x19:
Don't Look at Me
It had been six weeks
since Andrew Van De Kamp had declared war
on his mother Bree.
The final battle was about to be waged
at the Fairview county courthouse.
Bree knew it was about to get bloody.
What she didn't know was...
the cavalry was on its way...
Bree?
...whether she wanted them there or not.
Eleanor!
Oh, thank God I found you.
This place is a maze.
What are you doing here?
Well, your father and I got a call
last night from Danielle,
and she said that Andrew was taking you to court.
I mean, to say that we were shocked
would be an understatement.
Hello, I'm Eleanor Mason,
Bree's stepmother.
You're the lawyer? We should talk.
Uh, no, I'm not her lawyer.
Good. The hair had me worried.
Peter is mom's sponsor from A.A.
Oh, sweetie!
Since when are you in A.A.?
It's a recent development. Where's dad?
In chambers with the judge.
What?! Why?
Everything is fine.
The judge agreed to a postponement.
Oh, thank God!
Luckily, he remembered me.
I spoke once at his law school.
Pardon me, sir,
I'm your daughter's lawyer.
Just so you know, we've been
waiting for this hearing for weeks.
Son, I've been an attorney for 45 years.
You and I both know how these cases
can turn into public spectacles.
Our family is perfectly capable of handling this
... in house.
Dad, you don't understand.
This has gotten really ugly.
That's why we're here.
We're gonna put this family back together.
Whatever it takes.
And that's when Mr. and Mrs. Solis,
fearing for the welfare of this helpless child,
fled the hospital.
You mean, they kidnapped her.
Well, technically, that's true, but...
given the situation that led up to the rescue...
Kidnapping?
Your honor, yes,
in retrospect, the plan was a little bit rash,
not entirely well thought out.
Idiotic.
Can we object to that?
But the child is safe, your honor.
And all we ask the court is to allow baby Lily
a lifetime of the care and love she has been receiving
from the Solises.
As much as your story tugs at my heart,
there is the issue of parental rights.
What does the state have to say about this?
We have located the biological father... Mr. Dale Helm.
Unfortunately, uh, circumstances require
that he be out of town.
He's in Fort Lauderdale today.
On business?
Spring break, actually.
Mr. Helm is a high school student.
Charming.
In between keg stands,
did the father happen to mention
if he plans to waive parental rights?
I've left a number of voice mails,
but the only response I've gotten is a text message
that says
this blows his mind and he's extremely bummed out.
All right...
Mr. and Mrs. Solis,
since you actually want Lily,
it seems you're the lesser of two evils.
I'm granting you temporary custody until
we can get a straight answer from the birth father.
Thank you,
uh, your honor.
In the meantime, try not to steal any more babies.
Oh, we just needed the one.
Sweetie?
Um, could you put the crayons down for a second?
We need to talk.
So I spoke to your teacher today,
and she told me about the...
cookie deal you made with Cindy Lou.
Oh. Are you mad?
No, not exactly.
I'm just...
I'm trying to understand why you...
did that.
Tommy Keenan told me
babies come from down there.
It doesn't sound right to me.
Well...
actually, he's kinda right.
He's got the concept down.
That's weird.
How's a baby get in there?
Daddy will be home from his business trip in a few days.
Why don't you wait for him?
Okay.
Okay.
Or I can ask Tommy's brother.
He's 14,
and he knows everything.
And then the mommy and the daddy,
because they love each other so much,
they hug.
Real tight.
And, uh, a seed is magically implanted.
And nine months later...
a baby is born. Here.
What kind of seed?
Oh, that's not important.
I don't believe you.
Parker, I'm your mother.
Mothers don't lie to their sons.
Now go wash your hands or Santa's not gonna
bring you anything for Christmas.
I just saw Edie drive off.
How long is she gonna be gone?
I don't know.
She just went to show a house.
Move.
What's the problem?
You mauled me in Edie's bed last night.
I think that deserves a conversation.
Well, what's there to talk about?
I'm just a fool in love.
Oh, no! You don't mean that.
Yes, I do.
Look, I realize my timing's a little off.
A little?
The helium hasn't even gone out of
the balloons from your engagement party.
Okay...
when are you gonna tell Edie?
Tell her what?
That the wedding's off.
Is it?
Well, isn't it?
It's up to you.
Are... are you saying...
that you're gonna go through with this wedding...
unless I tell you not to?
Just give me a commitment, Susie Q.,
And I'll put a bullet in Edie.
This is insane!
Come on.
All this can be yours again.
Just say the word...
and I let go.
Oh, no! No, don't you dare!
You know you want me to.
Just say it, Susie Q.
You're...
sick!
Zach, I'm going to the drugstore.
I'll be back in 20 minutes.
Whoa! Oh!
Paul?!
I was making cookies,
and I heard the most sickening thud.
Are you okay?
There's...
shortening on my doorstep.
Shortening?
That's the last thing
you'd want on your front porch.
It's meant for baking.
She's so adorable
and I just love the name Lily.
It was my grandmother's name.
So how are you holding up?
You must be exhausted.
You know, I'm a little tired, but it's not too bad.
Oh, wait a couple months.
She'll start sleeping through the night.
Oh, honey, please. Do I look like a masochist?
First thing tomorrow,
I'm hiring a nanny and a night nurse.
No, we're not.
My husband, the comedian.
I'm serious. I don't want
some stranger raising our baby.
Well, you guys are busy. We should go.
No, it's okay. I'll win this battle later.
We are not gonna be some yuppie couple
pawning off our kid on other people.
End of discussion.
Yeah, you should go.
Okay, bye.
Good luck.
Put down the burrito.
What is all this crap about me not getting help?
Look, a brand-new baby
needs to bond with its mother.
The church knows it, science knows it,
nature knows it.
We have the money.
What is wrong with getting a little help?
Then I'll be able to relax once in a while,
and I'll be able to be a better mother.
You wanna be a better mother?
Do what my mama did...
make sacrifices.
My mama worked her fingers to the bone for me.
And that's what put her in an early grave!
Well, that and the hit-and-run thing.
Look, I don't know why
you want to be emancipated,
and I don't know what you've
been doing to drive him crazy.
Bottom line...
it's over.
It's now time for you two to kiss and make up.
And just how are we supposed to do that?
Here's a thought...
just look each other in the eye and say,
"I forgive you. "
That's your solution?
It's actually a technique
invented by this Dutch therapist.
I saw him on tv.
He says, if you verbalize forgiveness,
the brain can trick the heart
into letting go of resentment.
It really works.
I did it with our cleaning lady.
Um, I'm sorry, dad, but I think
my relationship with Andrew
is just a bit more complicated than...
Would it kill you to at least try?
I'll do it...
for you, grandpa.
That's my boy.
Bree?
Fine!
Yes, um...
so, um, who goes first?
Either or. Doesn't matter.
Mom,
I forgive you.
Andrew,
I forgive you.
That wasn't so hard, was it?
Now don't expect to feel differently right away.
It takes a while.
It took me a week to forgive Esperanza.
But now she's like family again.
Family who stole from us.
So let's get back to the way we were,
and forget all this nonsense about emancipation.
Um...
well, grandpa, I'm... I'm still
gonna need my trust fund.
You see, I-I can't live in a place where I...
I don't feel safe.
What are you talking about?
Well, could you live with a woman who hits you?
Bree!
I slapped him once, and he deserved it.
Well, I just asked her to stop drinking.
You were drinking?
She's in A.A. Her sponsor has long hair.
Andrew, I find your concern ironic,
given how tanked you were when you ran over
our neighbor's mother with your car.
Is she okay?
She's dead!
Well...
mom watched as her boyfriend committed suicide.
And he was the same guy who killed dad!
Andrew falsely accused me of molestation...
in a mall!
You know, the technique works best
if you don't talk right away.
Okay, let's go.
I don't wanna be late for the movie.
Oh, those are pretty. Who sent those?
What?
"Say the word and I'm yours. Love, Karl. "
Mom, I knew this would happen
when you started hanging around together,
all of your old feelings resurfacing.
No, his feelings.
He's the one with the feelings, not me.
Uh-huh.
Okay, don't "uh-huh" me.
You're not old enough to do that.
Oh, no? Well, how do you like this:
I'm not gonna go to the movies with you.
You're gonna make me go by myself?
Well, you could always ask dad to go.
In fact, if you love him so much, why don't you marry him?
Oh, wait, you already did. Twice.
Oh, you know what? I think we're gonna
need some napkins with this.
Oh, okay, I'll go back.
Thanks.
My ex-boyfriend's here.
If he sees me alone, I'll die.
I'm begging you, please, act like you know me.
Susan? Hey!
Mike, hi! What a surprise.
How are ya?
Good.
Oh! God, I... I'm being so rude.
Um, Mike, I-I want you to meet...
Orson Hodge.
Nice to meet you, Mike.
Wow, I can't believe I'm finally seeing
the man himself in the flesh.
So... how'd you two meet?
Oh, God, I've been her dentist for years.
But last week, I was looking in her mouth
and decided to stick my tongue in it.
I'll see ya, Susan.
Thank you so much for helping me out.
Hey, I'm great in a crisis.
Well, I definitely picked
the right person to sit next to.
Actually, is this seat taken?
No.
Okay, you can share my popcorn.
Um, Susan...
this is Becky.
I'll probably be sharing her popcorn.
I'll just wait till the lights go out,
and then I'll...
While I get this going, can you bring out the buns?
Uh, yeah.
What the hell?
You all right?
This isn't lighter fluid. It's gasoline.
What?
How'd that get in there?
How do you think?
Something smells good over there.
Well, I don't understand.
Is she trying to kill you?
No, she's trying to piss me off.
Why?
I'm not sure yet,
but I do know I'm not gonna play along.
We got plenty of burgers
if you want to pop over.
And bring your appetite.
Gaby, the baby.
No, I got up twice already. It's your turn.
Gaby, I have several job interviews
tomorrow. I need my sleep.
What about my sleep?
You sleep when the baby sleeps.
Every 40 minutes?
When am I supposed to have a life?
What are you whining about?
You know, Xiao-Mei does
all the housework around here.
All you have to do is take care of the baby.
Fine, fine, fine!
Xiao-Mei.
Wake up.
Mrs. Solis?
Something wrong?
The baby won't stop crying,
and I haven't slept for two days.
Will you please take Lily for a while?
Oh, come on. I won't make you
do windows tomorrow.
Okay.
What do I do?
Well, she's a baby. You hold her.
You bounce her and, I don't know,
maybe sing a little something.
Ahh.
Oh, and Xiao-Mei,
Mr. Solis does not need to know about this, okay?
Okay.
Okay.
Yeah, honey, can you take that downstairs?
Thank you.
Eleanor, I thought you'd gone to bed.
Oh, no, not yet. I had to do my hair now.
There's never enough time in the morning.
Uh, sit.
There's something I have to discuss with you.
Your father and I have decided
to take Andrew back to Rhode Island with us.
Really?
And whose idea was that?
Andrew's.
But Henry and I feel it's the right thing to do.
Absolutely not.
If we leave him here,
the two of you will wind up in court,
and I'm not going to allow that.
Do you really think that I am enjoying
airing my dirty laundry in public?
This whole situation is mortifying.
But I can't back down because he is my son,
and I need more time to get through to him.
You never give up.
I've always admired that about you.
When you were a kid,
you used to make these peanut butter
cookies that were God-awful.
But you kept baking them,
and you kept forcing everyone to eat them.
You were so determined to get them right.
My mother didn't think they were awful.
When I made those same cookies for her,
she loved them.
Well, some people praise children
even when they don't deserve it.
Oh, but not you.
With you, I had to work
for every kind word I ever got.
Well, you always resented me
because of my high standards.
No.
I resented you because those were
kick-ass peanut butter cookies.
We're taking Andrew.
Eleanor, please...
He hates you, Bree.
Your own son.
You know, part of being an adult is admitting
that you've failed, and then moving on...
with grace.
Do you really think
that I am a failure as a parent?
well, I'd love to lie and say
something supportive,
but as you pointed out,
that was more your mother's thing.
Xiao-Mei?
So sorry. I just take break.
Oh, no, Xiao-Mei, that's okay.
That's okay. I know you were
up all night with the baby,
and I really appreciate it.
You know, I'm very grateful for everything
you've been doing for Lily.
So to thank you, I bought you
a gift certificate to my spa.
And you can take a whole day off
and just really pamper yourself.
Really?
Mm-hmm.
Thank you!
Oh, thank you!
Oh, you're welcome.
All right, Lily needs to be bathed and put to bed.
I don't wanna miss my yoga class.
Hi. Hi, pretty girl.
Oh, yes, mommy has to go.
Mommy has to go,
so she can stay pretty and thin
and you can be proud of her.
Motherhood is such a blessing.
I hope you get to experience it one day.
Because it's not a big deal!
"It's not a big deal"? Okay!
It's not that far away.
Right. Oh, it's not that far away?
Dude, it... whatever, okay?
You didn't even care to tell me before?
Bye.
Justin, what happened?
Andrew just told me
he's moving in with his grandparents.
They live so far away,
I'm never gonna see him anymore.
I'm so sorry.
I know that you're good friends.
We're more than friends, Mrs. Van De Kamp.
I love him.
Oh.
Why?
Yes. I'd be curious to know
just what it is you see in him.
Well, when my parents first heard
I was gay, they kicked me out.
They said I had debased the entire family
and that they couldn't love me
anymore until I changed.
But Andrew...
he said that I should be ashamed of them,
'cause they were too stupid
to know how great I was.
That's the thing about Andrew.
He doesn't take crap from anyone.
How can you not love someone like that?
You know, it never ceases to amaze me
how people can turn their backs
on their own family.
I mean... but it happens every day, doesn't it?
I guess.
You know, Justin, if you would be willing to help,
I'm pretty sure that I could find a way
to keep Andrew from moving.
What do you say?
I'm home.
Oh, hi.
Hey, Mrs. McCluskey.
So how did everything go?
Fine.
Penny fussed a bit.
I think her molars are coming in.
Oh.
And the twins fought over the remote.
There's nothing new there.
No.
Here's the big news...
Parker offered me a fudgsicle
if I would show him my vagina.
Oh, good God, Lynette, relax.
I didn't do it.
I just got this out of the freezer a second ago.
Uh, yeah, of course. No, sorry.
Apparently, Parker wanted to put
a sunflower seed inside me
and see if a baby would grow.
Where do kids get this stuff?
Oh... that was me.
He was asking about
the birds and the bees, and I
fudged a few of the details.
Well, he's only 7 years old.
I don't think he needs
to know everything yet.
I don't wanna rob him of his innocence.
Well, now, that's where you're wrong.
You get 'em when they're young.
Give them all the gory details.
And then when they're good
and disgusted, you shame 'em.
Excuse me?
You tell them sex is dirty and wrong
and he shouldn't talk about it,
and if he does, he's going straight to hell.
That is ridiculous.
Spoken like a true liberal idiot.
No, I'm not gonna shame my son.
Mm, I'm telling ya, it works.
It keeps people in their place,
it keeps parents from being humiliated,
and it keeps me from having to spend
the afternoon talking about my woo-woo.
In your haste to duck out
before the credits rolled, you...
Oh, my God! Oh, thank you so much.
I stuck a card in there,
just in case you ever wanted to
purposely sit next to me at a movie, so...
Orson, I'm flattered. Uh, really.
You... you don't wanna date me.
I I mean, my love life is just
so complicated right now.
Well... no, I won't bore you with the details.
So the ex-boyfriend has no idea
you're secretly married to the ex-husband,
who still loves you,
but unless you give him a reason not to,
is gonna marry the neighborhood slut?
Did I call Edie a slut?
Well, that's overstating it.
Edie's not a slut.
She's just... popular with indiscriminate men.
Anyway...
yes, those are the relevant players.
Okay.
Now I'm absolutely horrified that I'm
about to say what I'm about to say,
but there's nobody else I can
talk to who won't judge me.
And since you're a complete stranger,
I'll probably never see you again
unless I randomly run into you on the street,
in which case you'll ignore me
'cause you know how crazy I am.
So here goes...
I'm having feelings for Karl again.
Does that make me a terrible person?
You want my unvarnished opinion?
Lay it on me.
It doesn't make you a terrible person,
but it does make you a...
well... a sucker.
This Karl's a coward.
He wants you to be the heavy
and take all the responsibility.
If you're having feelings
for a guy like that, I say run
...far, far away.
He lives three houses down.
Hmm. Well, good luck to you, then.
But like I said, if you're
interested in a tooth whitening,
my card's still in your wallet.
Xiao-Mei?
Xiao-Mei?
I'm late to meet Mrs. Van De Kamp.
I'll be back in a little while.
Bree... I'm so sorry I'm late.
Oh, honey, it's all right.
I mean, with the new baby at home,
I'm surprised you made it at all.
Ooh, I'll have a drink.
Anything with an umbrella.
So tell me, how are you doing?
I mean, your entire world
must be turned upside down.
You must be exhausted.
You know, it's been challenging, but I-I soldier on.
So what about you? You look so rested.
I just got a massage at Misty Spring.
Things have been a little tense at home,
and I needed an hour to relax.
Good for you. I love that spa.
Oh, by the way, while I was there,
I saw your, uh,
your housekeeper.
Xiao-Mei?
Oh, no, you must be mistaken.
I just left her.
She's at home working.
Are you sure? I was talking to her
in the steam room for about 20 minutes.
What?
Yeah, apparently you gave her a gift certificate.
Lily?
Lily, mommy's coming!
Oh, thank God!
Oh, honey, I'm so sorry.
I'm never gonna leave you again.
Yes. Yes.
I'm home!
My interview got canceled.
Oh, that's my little girl.
Your chakra lining up nice for mommy?
That's my girl.
Hey, let me take her off your chest
so you can do your yoga.
No! No, no, no. We're doing just fine.
Aren't we, Lily?
Bridezilla's got me auditioning wedding bands,
and I'm clueless about Edie's taste in music.
What do you think of these guys?
That's why you brought me down here?
Karl, you made it sound
like it was an emergency.
It is! I need to have somebody
to dance with
so I can see if these guys have the power
to help me get my groove on.
Karl...
Oh, that's right.
You like it laid-back and romantic, don't you?
Guys, can we play something mellow?
No, don't bother, 'cause I'm going.
One, two...
That was not a coincidence.
This was playing the night we first kissed.
It's our song. Remember?
I remember.
I also remember that you are planning
on marrying someone else.
Not if you don't want me to.
Come on, Susie Q.
I can see you still have feelings for me,
and I know I have never stopped loving you.
Okay, you want the truth?
I don't know how I feel about you,
but I keep looking at you,
trying to see if you've changed,
if you've grown up.
You know what I see?
I see the same weak coward
that walked out on me three years ago.
Of course I've changed.
I don't think so.
So I think you should probably stay with Edie.
And the band is good.
You should hire 'em.
What the hell?
For God's sakes...
What the hell are you doing in there?!
This is my house. What are you doing?
We're tenting for termites.
We got a work order.
Signed by who?
Paul...
I've never been so embarrassed
in my whole life.
They're supposed to be tenting my house.
I must've written the address down wrong.
Muchachos, mi casa est aqu.
You've taken it too far this time.
These little mind games are gonna stop.
Right now!
And if they don't, whatcha gonna do?
Blow out your brains like your wife did?
Ahh!
Hey, hey!
Hey, you okay?
Did you hear that?
He assaulted me for an honest mistake.
God knows what would've happened
if you hadn't been here.
Let go!
Dad, dad, dad. Come on.
Come on. Come on, okay?
I talked to Mrs. McCluskey,
and for God's sakes, Parker,
you can't ask people things like that.
Why?
Because...
it's rude.
I said "please. "
Well, that doesn't matter!
You gotta quit talking
to people about their bodies,
and about where, you know, babies come from.
Why?
Because it's not an appropriate subject.
Why?
Because it's not.
Why?
Ugh!
Because it's dirty and wrong, and I'll wash
your mouth out with soap! That's why.
In that moment,
Lynette saw a look on her son's face
she had never seen before...
and she thought of the look he had on his face
when he had become obsessed with dinosaurs...
obsessed with baseball...
and obsessed with trains.
And it occurred to Lynette
she didn't need to shame her son.
All he needed was a brand-new obsession.
But I thought you said
we couldn't have a puppy.
Well...
it turns out we really needed one.
You can go and play.
And though she didn't know it at the time,
it would be another three years
before Parker Scavo would ever
ask about sex again.
Karl. What's going on?
Uh, I'm on my way to a motel.
I I just wanted to let you know
that the wedding is off.
It is?
I told Edie I wasn't in love with her...
at least, not in the way that she deserves.
Wow.
Why did you change your mind?
I mean, I hope it wasn't because of me,
because I told you...
It wasn't for you.
No?
You were right.
I have been a coward.
I was a coward three years ago
when I walked out on the two
most important people in my life.
And I was being a coward with Edie.
I mean, to even consider marrying her
when I know what real passion
and real love feels like.
Anyway, I-I-I just thought
I'd let you know.
Karl...
you look pretty beat up.
Why... why don't you...
why don't you come in and...
we'll crack open a bottle of wine.
Come on.
All right, here we go.
This is the last of Andrew's things.
Once we tape up these boxes,
we can start loading the car.
I'm proud of you, Bree.
You're being awfully big about this.
Well, I have to admit,
I was a bit upset at first.
But then it hit me.
You're his grandparents. You should bond,
get to know the real Andrew.
Oh, dad, I-I forgot to warn you.
These are some of Andrew's adult videos.
I don't approve, but boys will be boys.
Oh, Henry, stop looking at that filth.
I don't get it.
Where are the women?
What are you talking about?
This is all just a bunch of...
naked men.
Sweet mother of God.
What the hell are they doing?
I don't know, and I don't
even know what I'm looking at.
Henry, this is pornography for homosexuals.
Oh, shoot! I wish you hadn't gone through that.
Now we have to have an unpleasant conversation,
and we were having such a nice time.
Bree, is...
is Andrew... gay?
Oh, dad, Andrew hates labels.
I'm sure it's just a phase.
Excuse me,
but he has a magazine titled
"Leather Daddies in Love. "
That does not sound like a phase to me.
Maybe not, but it's no longer my concern
now that he'll be living with you.
We have to have a serious talk.
Let's don't freak out about this.
The Dutch therapist says...
Forget the Dutch therapist! In the kitchen!
Now!
Hey, where's grandma and grandpa?
I need to start loading up my stuff.
Oh, they, uh, they already left.
Wait... they left?
Without me?
Uh, yeah, they wrote you a letter.
It seems they came across
some personal items of yours that, um,
upset them.
They're taking away my trust fund?
They can't do that!
Well, actually they can.
I mean, it's their money
to dispense with as they see fit.
I know it doesn't seem fair, but...
No, it's really unfair. In fact, it sucks.
What... what am I supposed to do now?
Well, now that you can't afford
to become emancipated,
I guess you're gonna
have to stay here with me.
Andrew, we can make this work.
We just have to let go of our anger.
No.
Oh, I, um, had a chance to have
a nice chat with Justin the other day.
He really seems very sweet.
I've invited him over for dinner tonight.
I hope you don't mind.
Now I wish I hadn't torched our wedding photos.
Who would've thought,
after everything that's happened,
that we would've ended up back here again?
It's been one hell of a ride, huh?
Yeah.
So how do you feel now?
About us?
I feel good.
I feel happy.
You're not having second thoughts?
I can't believe you actually
want to talk about feelings.
You really have changed.
Hey, this is the new Karl, baby.
He's not afraid to cry.
Hello?
Oh, hi, Edie.
Uh...
yeah, he's here.
Hold on.
How does she know you're here?
I don't know.
Hi. Ahem.
Yeah, I just came by to help Julie
with her civics homework.
Uh-huh.
Okay, I'll take care of it.
What kind of juice do you want?
Right. Bye, bye.
Are you getting juice for her?
Yeah, just one carton.
You ripped the woman's heart out.
Why would she want juice from you?
Okay. Now don't freak out,
but this breakup is
sort of a work in progress.
She doesn't know?
Will you calm down? I can explain.
So if Edie doesn't know, then that means
that you just cheated on her.
With me!
You made me the other woman!
Please don't be angry.
I tried to break up with her,
but because I wasn't sure
you wanted me back,
the words just wouldn't
come out of my mouth.
Now that I know that you want me
and love me again, it's a done deal.
Get out of my house,
you miserable son of a bitch!
Can't we talk about this?
No, just get out! Get out!
Susie, Susie!
Our marriage was garbage!
Stupid, disgusting pile of garbage!
No, no, don't say that.
And I regret everything that came of it!
Don't do this right now.
Ugh! Except you, honey. You're my rock.
Ooh, out! Get out!
I... ugh!
I promise you I'm gonna break up
with Edie and make this right.
I'll call you when it's done.
Don't bother! I won't pick up.
We've all done something
in our lives we're ashamed of.
Some of us have fallen for the wrong man.
Some have let go of the right woman.
There are those who have humiliated their parents...
and those who have failed their children.
Yes, we've all made mistakes that diminish us
and those we love.
But there is redemption
if we try to learn from those mistakes...
and grow.
Previously on "Desperate Housewives"...
I'm granting you
temporary custody
until we can get a straight
answer from the birth father.
Gabrielle got exactly
what she wanted.
If Edie doesn't know,
then that means that you just
cheated on her with me.
Susan got fooled again...
I'm also a member
of S.A.
And Bree got too much...
Sex addicts anonymous.
... information.
Karl Mayer didn't pray often,
but when he did,
it was usually to ask
for God's help
in breaking up with a woman
and to spare him
the nasty drama
that usually accompanied
such callous
and unexpected departures.
Over the years, Karl had
dumped dozens of women,
and not one of them
had ever seen it coming.
Every retreat was always
meticulously planned,
right down to
the personalized stationary,
hence his record
of successful getaways
from women who did not
want to see him go.
So when he decided
to break up with Edie Britt,
Karl prayed to God yet again
to help him avoid
all the unnecessary drama.
Unfortunately for Karl...
God was in the mood...
to be entertained.
Come on!
What the hell is this?
Edie, baby, calm down.
"Let's be honest
with ourselves, Edie.
We haven't been happy
in a long time"?
Who are you to tell me
I haven't been happy,
you miserable son of a bitch?
I have been ecstatic!
Okay. I-I'm the one
who hasn't been happy, then.
Then why did you propose to me?
I don't know.
I have told every woman
in this town
that we are getting married,
and all you have to say to me
is, "I don't know"?
Oh, what else do you want me to say?
I'm sorry.
What's going on?
Is there someone else?
Oh, my God.
Oh, crap.
Come on, come on, come on!
As he sat there,
Karl couldn't help but wonder
why God had forsaken him.
It never occurred to him
that God...
might be a woman.
2x20:
It Wasn't Meant to Happen
God,
grant me the serenity
to accept the things
I cannot change,
the courage
to change the things I can
and the wisdom
to know the difference...
The members
of the Fairview chapter of A.A.
ended every meeting
with a prayer.
And while most
were asking God for help
in resisting temptation,
Bree Van De Kamp was busy thinking
thoughts that were downright sinful.
...with him in the next.
Amen.
Keep coming back.
It works if you work it.
Amen.
I think
you'd love the opera.
The music and the voices...
It's just all so... passionate.
Yeah, a 300-pound soprano
seducing balding tenors.
That'd be hot.
You making fun of me? Huh?
Bree...
Yes?
Maybe a little bit.
What's going on here?
Claude?
We made plans, remember?
I'm sorry.
I was just about...
Yeah, I saw what you
were just about to do.
I'm sorry, Peter,
but, uh, who is this?
This is Claude.
He's my sponsor.
Oh, your A.A. sponsor?
No.
I'm his other sponsor.
For my sex addiction.
Oh.
Damn it, Peter.
What did I tell you?
Avoid lust triggers.
And what is she?
Come on,
don't do this, man.
She's a lust trigger.
A lust trigger!
Um, excuse me.
I don't know what that means,
but could you please
stop saying it?
Where's your chip?
Give it to me.
Do you remember how low
you'd sunk when we met?
This represents
12 months of hard work,
not giving in
to your urges.
Now if you wanna
blow all that on this woman,
just tell me now so I can stop
wasting my time working with you.
I don't want to blow it.
Good.
Then tell
the pretty lady good-bye
and that you can't
socialize with her anymore.
And do it quick.
I'm hungry.
Bad news.
Ed wants us
to push through tonight
and finish
the Edelstein realty pitch.
But we're not presenting
for another two weeks.
Why don't we start tomorrow?
But how would that help Ed avoid his marital problems?
What?
Oh, he's right. I hear Ed
fighting with Fran on the phone
every day through the office walls.
That would explain all our working hours.
Yeah, but you lucked out, Scavo.
Darlene talked him into cutting
the people who have kids
in day care loose.
Hey, great. Let's go
before he changes his mind.
But that doesn't include you,
Miss senior V.P.
Ed wants you in the conference room now.
You're kidding!
You're his security blanket, Lynette.
He stays, you stay.
Jerry, can you help me
get the kids down to the car?
Oh.
Yeah.
Thanks, Jer.
Sure.
Lynette?
Yeah?
Get those mock-ups together,
will you?
Jerry, I didn't know
you had a kid.
Y yeah, um, out of wedlock.
Oh.
So... see you in the morning.
I'm sorry I'm late.
What's going on?
Karl broke up with Edie.
Oh, my God.
Yeah, apparently,
he was seeing someone.
Really?
Did he say who it was?
I know who she is.
She's a man-eating,
scum-sucking ho-bag.
No, he did not say.
You know,
when Karl dumped you,
I thought
that it was all your fault.
Yeah, I figured that...
you were a nag or bad in bed.
But now I... now I see that
you were just a victim, too.
We have a bond, Susan.
It's like we're sisters.
There's even
a pretty one and an ugly one.
Edie!
No, I'm just saying
that Karl screwed us both.
Yes, like you
wouldn't believe.
Guys, I'm all for bashing exes, but let's save
a little of our hate for his partner in crime...
the other woman.
Mm-hmm.
Yeah! You know, they're always
coming up with these excuses
to justify
being a home-wrecker.
Exactly! Like,
"he wouldn't have been with me
if he was gettin' it
at home. "
Yeah, "honey,
you're the love of my life.
she's just the runner-up. "
Oh, look, the baby's
doing something really cute.
She's sleeping.
Like an angel.
Look, I think we all know
that Karl is a dog.
I mean, but let's face it...
if these tramps
weren't laying out the buffet,
he wouldn't be chowing down.
Well, every situation
is different,
and it's hard to judge
until we know all the details.
Which... obviously I don't know,
because how would I know?
She's a slutty, slutty whore.
Absolutely.
Yeah.
Are you sure she needs that?
I just put sunscreen on her.
Yes, she needs the bonnet.
It completes the outfit.
Oh, for God's sakes, Gaby.
She's never too young
to start accessorizing.
Besides, all the neighbors
are out today,
and I want them to see how happy
we are and wish they were us.
Hey.
Uh, the baby's a beauty.
We think so,
but we're a little biased.
Oh, wow,
she's got my eyes.
Huh?
Oh, I'm Dale.
Dale Helm.
I'm the baby's birth father.
Uh, well, hi, Dale.
Nice to meet you.
A lot of people
have been looking for you.
Yeah, I know,
lawyers and stuff.
I got kinda held up in Florida
longer than I thought.
Spring break, right?
Yeah. Oh, man,
we were wasted 24/7.
Then I got the message
and just thought
my friends were messing with me.
Those buttwads!
Ahem.
Well, it's a good thing
he's here.
We can take him
to the lawyer's office,
and you can sign over
full custody to us.
Okay.
Yeah, uh,
the thing about that is,
I'm gonna want the baby.
Come on, you guys.
We don't have to make this ugly.
You're trying to take our baby!
How is it not gonna be ugly?
Just keep walking, Gaby.
Don't engage him.
Listen, Mr. Solis...
No, you listen! We were granted custody.
If you want her,
you talk to the judge.
Hey, what is the holdup?
They told me I gotta talk to a judge.
What the hell are you doing here, Frank?
It's his baby. Give it to him!
Like hell!
Hey, Mrs. Solis, can I see the baby?
No!
Dale, just do it already!
I'm not just gonna kidnap it.
Why not? They did!
It is your baby.
Just take it!
Try it.
Frank?
Get in, you moron.
Anyways, it looks like
you're doing a good job with her.
Dumb-ass!
She seems clean.
And like I said,
we have been very happy here,
and I'm sure you will be, too.
Well, we just love it.
Yeah.
Once the stairs are repaired,
I'll show you the basement.
What's going on?
The house just sold.
Start packing.
Why don't you just
put Caleb in an institution?
It's where he belongs anyway.
My mom would never let strangers take care of him.
Then why don't you call the police?
Then it's not up to her.
If I call the police,
my mom and I go to jail with Caleb.
We've been hiding a murderer.
Now, look, if we...
If we do move, I promise
I will call you every day.
I don't need a phone buddy.
I need a boyfriend!
Would you calm down, please?
Don't tell me what to do!
You know, I could go to the police myself!
Danielle...
I just...
I love you so much.
I would do anything
to keep you here.
Yeah, I see that now.
You can't leave me alone here.
You have to think of something.
Don't worry.
I will.
Oh, my God!
Ed? Hey, I'm so sorry,
but obviously that was just
meant for Tom's eyes only.
Honest mistake.
Don't even worry about it.
Okay.
Thanks. Well, I'm gonna
go back in my office
and continue to feel like
a huge pervert.
At least you and Tom
have a love life.
Well, we do the best we can
given the circumstances.
Better than Fran and I.
We're dead in that department.
I don't wanna
bore you with the details.
I appreciate that.
You know, Ed...
I don't wanna pry
into your personal business,
but if you are having
problems in that area,
you don't have
to be resigned to it.
What are you suggesting,
hookers?
No, Ed Ferrara
doesn't pay for sex.
I mean, you and Fran
could spice it up a bit.
You know, get the old juices
flowing again.
Oh, I see.
Kinda like, uh...
"I'd like to lick you
from head to foot. "
Okay, well,
that wasn't my best work,
but you can't deny results.
IMing works,
and when I go home tonight,
Tom and I are going to...
Okay, well,
I'm gonna be exhausted,
so I'll probably just lay there.
But trust me,
Tom is gonna go to town.
It's something to think about,
Lord knows.
You know what
the sad truth is?
I have been thinking
about hookers.
Okay!
Uh, well,
I hope that helped.
And I'm just gonna
go back and finish
so we can all get
out of here.
Let me guess.
You're not here for a bear claw.
No, I'm not.
You're wasting your time.
Look, you don't have
to worry about Peter,
not while he's with me.
Yeah? Why is that?
Because when it comes to sex,
I have an unwavering moral compass.
Truly. A man could
beg and plead all day long,
and it wouldn't make
any difference.
So, since I have
such strong self-control,
there's really no reason
for us to end our friendship.
The guy's a ticking bomb.
You have no idea
the kind of depravity
that comes with this disease.
Waking up in a stranger's bed
every morning...
cruising the park at night,
looking for somebody
to get off with,
compulsive masturbation
every chance you get!
Look, for guys like
Peter and me,
there's no beauty
in the sex.
It's an empty and ugly compulsion.
Well, I am sorry,
but the Peter I know has a little more s...
Hold up.
Claude, I need some...
I need some help.
What are you doing here?
Are you using?
No, but I bought a bag.
You're an embarrassment to me.
Give.
There's a meeting over
on 10th street. You go there.
You call me after.
I'm sorry.
Get the hell out of my shop.
I'm also a sponsor
at cocaine anonymous.
Well, aren't you
the renaissance man.
Are we done here,
princess?
Not yet. You obviously have an
encyclopedic grasp of everything depraved.
But clearly, you don't have
the slightest idea
about the power
of a loving relationship.
This is all you are to Peter.
Something to satisfy
his addiction.
Well, I think Peter is
a better man than you do,
and I am not gonna let you keep us apart.
Try and stop me.
Peter does everything
I tell him to do.
That's the one thing
you can depend on with addicts:
They're weak.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
May I ask you something?
Yes, ma'am?
If a citizen,
an ordinary citizen like myself,
knew of someone holding
a significant amount of drugs,
what would my responsibilities be,
you know, under the law?
What's all this?
And this one,
I ran out and got
the day I found out Karl
was doing it with his secretary.
I think you'll find this
particularly helpful.
It's got a chapter called,
"Revenge: you're only hurting yourself. "
Yeah, you know,
I'm just really not
into the whole reading thing.
Oh. Well, um, why don't
we get you out of here?
Let's go see
a feel-good movie.
Why are you
being so nice to me?
Well, I just wanna help.
So how about that movie?
You know how I like to heal?
I get hammered.
Uh... well, um...
then I should just go and let
you get started with that.
Do you really wanna
help me? Good.
'Cause I'm gonna need
a designated driver.
Oh! Uh...
Okay.
How could he be arrested
for cocaine possession?
Claude swore he was clean.
It's just awful, isn't it?
I mean, you never know what
people are doing behind your back.
Would you like some milk
with your cookies?
Thanks.
It's just, you know...
He was he best sponsor
I've ever had,
and I don't know
what I'm gonna do now.
Well, I have been doing
some thinking and...
here's a thought:
Why don't I be your sponsor?
You gotta be kidding.
You don't know squat
about sex addiction.
Well, cravings are cravings,
and all you really need
is a friend to call
when you start having
inappropriate thoughts,
and I can be that friend.
Well, there's more
to it than that.
Claude rescued me from some
pretty nasty scenes over the years.
Well, if you were in trouble,
I could handle it.
How can you be so sure?
Because I can be very strong
for those people
that I really care about.
How can you have
any feelings for me at all?
I mean, you've only known me
for a few weeks.
Yes, and in that time,
I've come to learn that
you're good and kind and smart.
And, yes, you have a little problem
that you need some help with,
but I'm willing
to be there for you.
So what's the big deal?
If you saw me at my worst,
you might not like me so much.
Peter,
let me be your rock.
Taking care of people
is what I do best.
Drink your milk.
Ah-ah-ah. Mmh-mnh.
I asked for extra spicy.
I'm pretty sure
you said medium.
Are you? Well, maybe
if you'd written it down,
you would've spared yourself
the walk of shame
back to the kitchen.
Edie, why are you
torturing that girl?
That is her. That is the one
that Karl is in love with.
We have been here
a million times,
and you should see the way
that she flirts with him,
and when she comes back here,
I am gonna shove this pitcher
in her perky little mug,
and when she's...
Okay, let's not make a scene.
It's not worth it.
For the sake of argument,
let's... let's... let's say
that it's someone else.
You know, probably it would be
a vulnerable, lonely woman
who Karl
just took advantage of,
and what if...
this poor, confused soul
begged your forgiveness?
What would you say?
I'd say...
"too little,
too late, bitch,"
and then I'd kick her.
Oh.
Yeah, but you don't have
to worry about that,
because I'm positive it's her. I mean, who else could it be?
Yeah.
Karl's office is all guys,
and then the only women he sees
are me, Julie,
that... that lesbian that does
his taxes and you.
You know what?
It is her.
Really? Why?
She just...
spit in your wings.
You got my back?
Uh... sure?
Here you go, extra spicy.
You did that on purpose.
You are going to pay!
Oh!
Whoa!
Fight, fight!
Get off me, you!
Get off me!
Mayer! Four on one!
A little help!
So, uh, when we leave...
who you gonna miss
the most?
I don't know.
Yeah, you do.
You said good-bye
to her yet?
No.
Look, man, it's...
it's okay if you like her.
You know, I think Danielle
really likes you, too.
Really?
Yeah, she told me she'd be really sad
if you left and didn't say good-bye.
You know, I think that she might
even want you to give her a little kiss.
But Danielle doesn't even
like me in her room.
She gets mad.
Yeah.
I talked to her about that.
She feels really bad.
But you know what?
She told me,
if you come in her room again,
she won't get mad.
And, Caleb,
she's gonna act like she
doesn't want you to kiss her...
but she does.
Dale Helm,
like all the students
at Parsons Christian Academy,
was taught that his future
was safely in God's hands.
What he didn't know
was that Gabrielle Solis
was about to force a fumble.
All right, guys,
you all know next week
we're playing the Falcons!
And we're gonna fry up
those birdies for dinner,
'cause we're the Huskies!
And who are the Huskies?
God's team! God's team!
God's team!
God's team! God's team!
God's team! God's team!
God's team!
God's team! God's team!
What are you doing?
You can't be here.
Let's talk turkey.
What is it gonna take
for you to give up the baby?
It's not gonna happen, okay?
I gotta get back. I'm the
quarterback. It doesn't look right.
Okay, no, no!
Wait, what about a car?
Or college? Tuition's a killer
these days. I could help you out.
I don't need help.
You hear those cheers?
Those are for me.
Last game,
I threw 246 yards.
With stats like that, I can get
into the college of my choice.
So why do you
want to be a dad?
These are your glory days.
A baby would ruin your life.
Oh, I know. But Frank said once I get
the baby, he's gonna take it off my hands.
But it's not even his.
Libby dumped him.
He thinks that if he has the baby
and she sees him
acting all mature,
she'll take him back.
No, no, no.
I am not letting that idiot use
my baby as a bargaining chip.
Hey, it's out of my hands!
No, it doesn't have to be, okay?
Just do the right thing
and sign the release form.
Look, I'm really sorry.
Before we adjourn today,
let's take a moment
to bow our heads.
Hello, everyone.
I'm Gaby Solis,
class of '94. Whoo-hoo!
I just wanted to give God
a big shout out
for this amazing season.
The man upstairs has definitely
been on your side,
and you wanna know why?
Because you boys live clean.
You keep your noses up,
you stay out of trouble,
and you don't go around
getting strippers pregnant.
And that's a good thing,
'cause if one of you
caused a scandal like that,
not only would that guy
get kicked off the team
and lose
all of his scholarships,
but God would drop
your school colors so fast,
it'd make your head spin!
And then the football season
would go to hell.
No pun intended.
So my point is,
do the right thing,
and no one gets hurt.
Signed, sealed, delivered.
Lily's ours.
So what do you think?
Are you staying late again,
or can I finally have dinner
at home with my wife?
God, I don't know.
I'm gonna go check with Ed.
Okay.
Hey, any luck
with that IMing thing?
No, not really.
I was online chatting
with Fran a while ago,
and I asked her
what she was wearing,
and she said,
"a yellow blouse. "
Okay, that's good.
Then what?
Then... yeah, that's it.
I just kinda blocked.
You blocked?
Yeah, I didn't know what else to say.
You're an award-winning
copywriter, Ed.
You get paid to write.
Yeah, jingles for oatmeal,
not soft-core porn.
For God's sakes,
it's not brain surgery.
Is she still online?
Yeah, I think so.
"I love the way that blouse
clings to your body. "
"Are you joking?"
mnh-mnh-mnh.
"Nothing funny about
those beautiful breasts. "
"Yeah? What did you want
to do to me?"
Uh...
Ed, your conference call's ready.
Oh God, I almost forgot
about that.
Okay, I gotta go take this,
but you keep going,
'cause you're doing great.
No, Ed, I'm not
doing this for you!
Just...
What?
"Touch every inch of your body
until you're trembling. "
"Oh, yeah.
I'll bite you good. "
"Hell, yeah.
First, I want you
to touch yourself. "
"Oh, yeah!"
"I'm on my way. "
Hello?
Bree, it's Peter...
and I'm in trouble.
Hi, I'm... I'm looking for,
um, Peter McMillan.
I'm not sure I know him.
You should ask my wife.
She organized the party.
Hey, Judy, get over here
and act like a hostess!
Come on in!
Come on, come on, come on.
Hey there.
Things are just
getting started.
After you take off your clothes,
feel free to jump right in.
No, no, I'm... I'm good.
I'm just, um, here
to pick up my friend Peter.
He's locked himself in your bathroom,
and I'm here to take him home.
Oh, yeah, that guy.
We were wondering about him.
The bathroom's over there.
Hey, is that
your natural color?
Yes, it is.
Beautiful.
I wish mine would do that.
This is out of a bottle.
Yes, I'm aware of that.
Peter?
Peter, it's Bree.
Are you in there?
What are you doing here?
I'm a sex addict.
What do you think?
You can't possibly be turned on
by what's going on out there.
Disgusting, isn't it?
Yes. Why would you wanna come to a place like this?
I didn't.
I wanted you to come.
I can't make you
not have feelings for me,
but I can show you who I was,
what my life was like.
Well, that's not
your life anymore.
But it could be.
If I slip again, this is exactly
where you could find me,
or someplace worse.
Then what would you
think of me?
Peter...
Bree...
it's dangerous to care about me.
A lot of people have
over the years,
and they all end up
getting hurt.
Rex said
he'd always be faithful.
George said
he'd never hurt me,
and as it turned out,
they were both liars.
So as long
as you're honest with me,
you'd be amazed
at what I can put up with.
Now let's go home.
Hey there.
Did you have a late night?
I hope.
It was horrible.
The whole thing
blew up in my face.
Why would you tell my wife
to bite my nipple off?
I didn't!
I didn't.
Why would she... oh!
The honeymoon thing.
Yeah, and it hurt
like hell then, too.
And it didn't take her long to figure out
that I let a stranger seduce her online.
Oh, God!
She was so mad, she locked
herself in the bathroom
and called a divorce lawyer.
You're getting divorced?
I spent two hours pleading with
her through the bathroom door,
begging her
not to leave me, and...
we finally managed
to come to terms.
What kind of terms?
I promised her I would fire the person who did it.
You're gonna fire me?
No, of course not.
You're too important here.
I'm gonna fire Tom.
I told her it was him
that sent the IMs.
What?!
I told her that he had a problem with boundaries.
I'm sorry.
I didn't wanna do this,
but my marriage
was on the line.
You can't make my husband
your scapegoat.
I won't let you.
I don't have a damn choice.
I can't be divorced, Lynette.
I can't.
He's under contract.
If you just fire him,
he'll sue you, and I'll back him up.
You need cause.
Well...
I guess
I'll have to find cause.
It shouldn't be too difficult
if I look hard enough.
Hey, how's the eye?
Oh, it's still a little red,
but think I got
all the hot sauce out.
That's good.
So, um...
you know the other day
when I said that thing
about us being sisters?
Well, when I said it
I really didn't mean it.
Yeah, I kind of figured that.
No, I mean, I really
didn't mean it. But, um...
now I do.
Thank you.
Thank you for having my back.
So do I have to worry about you
attacking any more waitresses?
Nah,
my bar brawlin' days are over.
Oh, you know, I-I've gotta go.
I have a meeting.
I'll talk to you later.
Are you Oliver?
You must be Edie.
Pleasure to meet you.
Oh, likewise.
I hear you're one of the best
private detectives in town.
I do what I can.
Well, come on in.
Let's talk.
Um... basically, I just
want you to trail my ex.
He, uh... left me
for another woman,
and I wanna nail that ho
to the wall.
Caleb?
Hey, come on, buddy,
wake up.
Caleb?
It's time.
Get away from me!
Get away from her!
Danielle, I want you to pick up
the phone and call the police.
No!
What?
Matthew and his mother
have been protecting Caleb.
They're in as much trouble
as he is!
I don't care.
Mom, please! I love him.
Please.
If I hadn't been
in the house,
he could've raped her...
or worse.
He's locked
in his room now, so...
Needless to say,
the agreement between us is off.
Caleb is dangerous,
and I want him put away.
If he is not gone by tomorrow,
I am calling the police.
He will be. I promise you.
Can I go check on Danielle?
Yes.
Betty, I am serious.
Either you do something,
or I will.
Bree, stop worrying.
I understand
what needs to happen now.
Danielle?
Did it work?
Perfectly.
You did great.
Um, so I got some rates
on some mental hospitals
around here,
and there's one called
Silvercrest
which actually seems okay.
Put this ham in the fridge,
will you?
I think I'll make it
for dinner.
Uh, mom, I know you don't wanna
talk about this, but we have to.
Mrs. Van De Kamp
is gonna call the police.
I promised myself I would never
institutionalize your brother.
Mom!
How long do you think it'd be before he'd act out,
maybe even hurt somebody?
A couple of days? A week?
Then they'd throw him
in a straitjacket
and drug away
what's left of his mind.
He'd spend the rest of his life
at the mercy of strangers.
But if we don't send him
to a hospital,
he's gonna end up in prison,
and don't you think that's worse?
Yes, of course I do.
So what the hell
are we gonna do?
Phenobarbital?
It's easy.
It's painless.
It's just a few extra drops.
He simply falls asleep.
Caleb was meant for a better
world than this, Matthew.
It's time to give your brother
the peace he deserves.
Who's the pretty girl?
Oh, looks like
it's daddy's turn.
I got her.
Yes.
Oh, yes.
Mrs. Solis?
Yes?
We have a court order to take
the Collins baby into custody.
No, no, no,
that's a mistake.
No, we...
we have the paperwork.
The birth father
signed away his rights.
It's the birth mother
who's protesting.
What?
Until the adoption
is legally finalized,
the birth mother
can still change her mind,
and... she has.
No, no,
no, no, no, no!
Gaby, wait.
You? You don't even
wanna be a mother!
Well, look, Frank quit
usin', and, uh, he got
a good job down at the plant.
He's really stepped up.
So?!
Well, so we're gonna give
the whole family thing a shot.
Well, I'll totally give you
all your money back.
I don't want my money back.
I want my baby!
Come on, let's go.
Carlos!
No!
Carlos, what's happening?
No, no, no, ma'am, You don't understand,
You don't understand.
This is our baby!
No, we've been... we've been
feeding her, and we...
we've been bathing her,
and we wake up in the middle
of the night and we rock her,
which is crazy,
'cause if you knew me,
I don't do that.
I don't do that.
And... and my husband...
my husband, he sings to her.
He sings,
so you can't take her away.
It's too late. We've already
fallen in love with her!
Carlos, do something!
No, you can't go!
You can't... you can't take her!
You can't take her!
No!
She's our baby!
She's our...
No!
Please!
There is a prayer intended
to give strength to people
faced with circumstances
they don't want to accept.
The power of the prayer
comes from its insight
into human nature...
We ask God
to grant us the serenity
to accept the things
we cannot change...
... because so many of us
rage against the hand
that life has dealt us...
... the courage
to change the things we can...
... because so many of us
are cowardly
and afraid to stand up
for what is right...
... and the wisdom
to know the difference.
... because so many of us
give in to despair...
when faced
with an impossible choice.
The good news
for those who utter these words
is that God will hear you
and answer your prayer.
The bad news is that sometimes
the answer is no.
Previously on "Desperate Housewives"...
Until the adoption is legally finalized,
the birth mother can still change her mind,
and she has.
Warrants were issued...
I'm going to fire Tom.
If you just fire him, he'll sue you,
and I'll back him up.
You need cause.
Well, I guess I'll have to find cause.
Decisions were made...
I'm going to do something
so awful,
it is going to rock her world.
Threats were spoken...
So what the hell
are we gonna do?
And plans...
Phenobarbital?
It's time to give your brother
the peace he deserves.
...were put into action.
The most
successful private investigator
in Fairview
was a man named Oliver Weston.
Try though he might,
Oliver couldn't remember
the exact moment
he stopped believing in love.
Was it the night
he caught an executive
cheating with his secretary?
Or was it the day
he saw a housewife
cheating with her delivery boy?
Or was it the time
he caught the girl next door
cheating with the couple
who lived across the street?
Whenever the moment,
Oliver Weston
was now officially a cynic
who only believed in betrayal
and suspicion.
Luckily for Oliver,
that's what paid his bills.
Okay, you forgot fighting.
What are you doing?
Oh. Sorry, man.
Are these your bushes?
I'll clean that
all up when I'm done.
It'll be like
I was not here.
You're done now.
Whoa, easy, big fella.
I'm just a PI doing
a domestic surveillance job.
For who?
The blonde lady
at the end of the street.
Edie Britt?
Yeah. That's her fianc.
Apparently, he dumped her
for another woman,
and I just figured out who.
Susan?
There's nothing going on there.
They used to be married.
She's only talking to him
because they have a kid together.
From what I heard, they're on their way to kid number two.
Well, you don't know what you're talking about.
Yeah, and you don't know these soccer moms like I do.
By day, they bake cookies
and carpool.
But dim the lights and bam...
they turn into total pigs.
She's not like that.
Oh, please. Look at her.
That woman clearly knows
her way around a mattress.
Yes, Oliver Weston
had become a cynic,
which is why
he couldn't recognize
a man who was still in love.
2x21:
I Know Things Now
Every family
has a way of hiding
what it doesn't want seen.
Whether it's with a picture
that covers
a stain on the wall...
or with a closet door that
conceals the chaos inside...
or with artificial smiles
that mask
years of pain and heartache,
every family
goes to great lengths
to hide ugly truths.
Some, of course,
go further than others.
So are you
gonna do this tonight?
No, the ice cream
is for tomorrow.
I'm taking Caleb on a picnic
to Rockwater Lake.
I'm preparing
all of his favorite foods.
So when you're done,
you're just gonna...
leave him lying there?
No.
I'll call 9-1-1 anonymously,
but I will be watching
from a distance to make sure
that...
that they pick up his body.
You know, mom,
you don't have to do this.
I won't let him
hurt another girl,
and I will not
turn him over
to people who will
mock and abuse him.
I just won't.
His last day on this earth
is going to be a perfect one.
Oh, no, thanks, Xiao-Mei.
The poor thing.
She was so attached to Lily.
Where'd all this food come from?
The people
from Carlos' church.
So you think you and Carlos
will try for another adoption?
I don't think I could
go through that pain again.
I did freeze some of my eggs,
so we might
do the surrogacy thing,
but I don't know.
Honey, you've got to eat something.
I don't have an appetite.
In fact,
this is all gonna go to waste.
You guys should take something.
No, no, you should keep it.
I'll take a couple.
What?
Karl dumped me, so I'm alone.
Food fills the void.
Xiao-Mei, I appreciate
your grief, but, really,
you're bringing everybody down.
Will you pull it together?
Mrs. Solis...
I don't understand.
It's from the government.
Let me see.
Gaby,
she's being deported.
Xiao-Mei, is this
the first letter like this
you've received?
Oh, my...
this can't be happening.
I can't go home!
My uncle will sell me again.
Oh, no, no, Xiao-Mei,
you're not going anywhere.
Hey, you're much too important
to Carlos and me.
We're gonna fight this
and we're gonna win.
Gaby, you can't promise her that.
Bree,
you heard what she said.
I can't let this poor kid
go back to China
and become someone's slave.
Thank you.
All right. Look, my friends
wanna take some of this to go,
so pack it up, and we're
a little low on coffee.
You're actually
gonna let me eat this?
Well, you've been
working so hard,
off on business trips
all the time.
Tonight, we throw caution
and cholesterol to the wind.
You deserve
a little comfort food.
Oh no, you're pregnant.
God, your mind
goes to dark places.
Honey, you just served me
a plate of full-fat gouda.
What's up?
Okay, well...
Remember I was helping Ed
spark up his love life?
Yeah, you sent his wife
those sexy IMs. Why?
Well, Fran found out
that Ed didn't send them,
and she blew her top.
She wants
the responsible party fired,
and Ed lied and told her...
that you sent them.
But... but it wasn't me.
It was you.
I know.
Oh, oh, but Ed couldn't
possibly lose you.
No, no, no,
I'm the expendable one.
Look, I know it's ridiculous,
but Ed is not a rational person.
Fran has him whipped,
and a whipped husband is someone
we must take very seriously.
Okay.
How do we handle this?
You're under contract.
Ed can't fire you
unless he has just cause.
So until this blows over,
you have to be a model employee.
Show up on time,
no more 3-martini lunches,
And above all, have ready
all your presentations.
I can't believe
I'm being victimized like this.
Well, honey,
in all fairness...
those are all things
you should be doing anyway.
Fine!
Andrew, I am having Peter
over for dinner tomorrow night,
and I was wondering if you
would like to invite Justin?
Yeah. Um, thanks.
I'll... I'll call him tonight.
Since you two are having
your boyfriends over,
can I invite Matthew?
Out of the question.
So let me get this straight.
You can date a lush,
and he can bring over
his gay lover,
but God forbid
I date a hot black guy.
Until they lock Caleb up,
I don't want you
anywhere near that family.
His brother tried to rape you,
and his mother keeps the guy
locked up in a basement.
I mean, let's face it, Danielle,
even you could do better.
Since when do you take
mom's side over mine?
Your brother and I had a talk,
and we've come
to a dtente of sorts.
Really? Even after she screwed
you out of your trust fund?
Well, he did falsely accuse me
of child abuse.
I would say we're even.
Wouldn't you, Andrew?
Sure, mom. We're even.
You can stop smiling now.
I know your face is tired.
What?
I'm not stupid. I know you
hate her now as much as ever.
Mom and I are
in a good place right now.
Why can't you believe that?
Hi. I got your message.
What's up?
Come on in.
This is Oliver Weston.
He's a PI Edie hired.
Edie hired a... PI?
Yeah. He's been
spying on you and Karl.
How you doing?
He thinks you two
have been having an affair.
Me and Karl?
Why would you think that?
Come on, Suze. You know
we're meant to be together.
Karl, just stop.
Well...
that is Karl being nostalgic.
You said yourself,
the sex last week
was the best you ever had.
Okay, um...
first of all, it was not
the best sex I ever had.
I just said that
to make him feel better.
Obviously, you
were the best sex I ever had.
That explains
the punch in the face.
I'm gonna hit you again
if you don't shut up.
I know that this looks bad...
You were actually fooling around
with Karl behind Edie's back.
He told me that he and Edie
had split up before...
You know what? I don't even care.
Mike...
Are we done here?
Yeah.
Good night, Susan.
Hey! Hey, you!
Wait, wait, wait. Um...
Okay, you cannot
tell Edie about this.
Whatever she's paying you,
I'll pay you double.
She paid a 2-grand retainer
plus expenses.
$2,000?
Jeez! I gotta
get into real estate.
Okay, I don't have
that kind of cash.
Well, then I guess
I take the tape to Ms. Britt.
I have a copy!
Okay,
let's try this another way.
You are about to unleash
a nuclear explosion.
Lives are
going to be ruined.
I'll tell you what.
I'll hold off till Monday
to report to Ms. Britt.
Yes!
That'll give you some time to scrape together
a little cash.
What if I can't?
I'm sorry, but Xiao-Mei missed
all of her appeal deadlines.
So that's it? You're just
gonna send her back to China?
My hands are tied.
If your maid were married
to an American citizen,
or had a child
who was an American citizen,
or if she were
a well-known entertainer...
Uh...
what if she was pregnant
with an American citizen?
Uh, Xiao-Mei?
We spoke
to Homeland Security,
and we have good news!
I can stay?
Mm-hmm!
Oh! Thank you!
Oh! Okay.
Thank you!
Uh... well,
there's just one little thing.
The immigration laws have gotten
really tough in this country,
so we're a little
behind the eight ball going in.
But we pled your case,
and we fought tooth and nail,
and the law says you can stay...
but only
if you have our baby.
What?
The agent said that if you were...
pregnant with an american citizen,
then they couldn't deport you.
So we thought,
you need a baby in your belly,
we need a surrogate...
win-win-win.
"Sur-ro-gate"?
Oh, well,
it would be our baby.
It would just
be growing inside of you.
I...
Okay, uh... well...
uh... oh!
Okay, it's like this...
the three of us are making
your famous Szechuan dumplings,
and I'm the dough,
and Carlos is the pork,
and you're the oven.
I have baby?!
Okay,
we take care of everything.
You know,
uh, hospital bills
and maternity clothes
and Lamaze classes.
And, of course, you wouldn't
have to do any work.
Well, uh, maybe
just a little light dusting.
Nothing major.
No!
No, Xiao-Mei,
you don't have a choice.
It's either this
or go back to China.
No to baby!
No!
Had to push the dusting,
didn't you?
Peter, I don't think
I'm being unreasonable here.
It's not like I'm gonna
advertise my addiction history,
but if your kids
ask a direct question,
I'm not gonna lie to them.
Right! Uh-huh. Good point.
Listen,
I don't expect you to lie
about the alcoholism. I mean,
they know that's how we met.
It's just...
you know, the other thing.
Oh! The other thing.
They're just getting to know you,
and so I want them
to focus on your good qualities.
I just don't know
how they'll react
if they find out
that you're a sex addict.
What are you so happy about?
You know how you were mad at mom
about not letting Matthew
come to dinner?
Yeah?
I just figured out the funniest way
for you to get back at her.
Okay, what's on the schedule
for today?
I have got the Boston Toy
presentation ready to go.
Actually, I don't have time
for a full pitch,
so just give me the gist.
Excuse me?
You know, boil it down.
Give me one line.
Okay, basically,
it's "Toys are fun. "
I hate it.
How can you hate it? I only gave you three words.
It's three words I hate.
Okay, I'm gonna take over
the Boston Toy Company account.
No, you cannot take over...
In the meantime,
you should all be aware
I don't like the way
you people have been filing
your expense reports.
There's been
a lot of padding.
Meanwhile, this company
is hemorrhaging money.
I'm gonna put a stop to it,
so I have hired
a forensic accountant.
He's gonna go through them,
make sure everything's kosher.
And I find one receipt,
one bar tab that's fishy,
it's grounds for dismissal.
Oh, Scavo?
He's gonna start with you.
I can't believe
that son of a bitch
hired a forensic accountant.
He's more whipped than I thought.
Well, he's tragically
underestimated us.
The gloves are coming off.
You know,
maybe I should just quit.
What? Yesterday
you were up in arms.
Now you're ready to cave?
If Ed is determined to get me, sooner or later
he's gonna get me.
It's just a matter of time.
No, no!
We are not backing down.
I'm gonna walk over
to Ed's office right now,
and I'm gonna make very clear
that if you're out the door,
I'm right behind ya.
We can't both be unemployed.
Oh, it'll never happen.
He knows this place
will go down like
a house of cards without me.
Honey, wait. Just wait!
What, what?
I'm not gonna hide
behind my wife's skirt.
We're a team.
I'm just lending support.
That's not the way
it's gonna look
to everybody else out there.
Look, let me talk to him,
man to man.
If my way doesn't work,
then we'll do it your way.
Okay, go get him.
Lynette filled me in
about what happened
with you and Fran and the IM,
and I gotta tell ya, this isn't fair.
This isn't right.
Oh, my God!
Tom, what happened?
I think
I gave him just cause.
Uh...
Susan knew she couldn't afford
to keep the PI
from revealing
her affair with Karl,
and since Edie would learn
the truth anyway,
Susan felt it would be better
if it came from her...
which is how
she came to write a letter
begging Edie for forgiveness.
Her words were so sincere
and heartfelt,
from the moment she mailed it,
Susan knew...
she was a dead woman.
You know, Caleb...
since the day
you were born,
I've always thought of you
as a blessing.
You do know that, right?
I guess.
How come Matty's not here?
Because
this is our special day,
just you and me.
Is he mad at me?
'Cause of Danielle?
No. He knows that
you didn't mean to scare her.
'Cause he said it was okay
for me to kiss her.
What did you say?
He said Danielle liked me
and that she wouldn't fight me
if I gave her a kiss.
Your brother told you that?
Matty said that
she was waiting for me
and that she wanted
a really big kiss.
What else
did your brother tell you?
Xiao-Mei?
I made you some hot cocoa.
I guess the baby thing didn't
really appeal to you, huh?
I know it's a lot to ask.
It's just, Carlos and I
think of you as family.
Don't you
think of us as family?
Oh, yes!
You are like mother to me.
Mm-hmm.
Well, if we are so friggin' close,
what's the big deal?
It's nine months
out of your life.
I will be ruined.
"Ruined"?
Down there.
Wait.
Are you a virgin?
Wow!
If I have baby,
I will be shamed.
Are you kidding?
No one cares about virginity
in this country.
It went out of style
in the '50s,
and trust me, honey,
it ain't making a comeback.
Seriously, no one cares.
Husband would care.
No man want me if I ruined.
I want husband so much.
Well, what kind of husband
do you want?
Do you want a rich husband?
Well, then,
rich men don't marry virgins
for the same reasons
they don't hire chauffeurs
who can't drive.
They value experience.
Really?
Would I lie to family?
Here are the numbers
you wanted.
Lynette, wait.
Have you heard from Tom?
He's not answering his cell phone.
But you don't have
to worry, okay?
You got what you wanted.
He's out of the building.
Come in here
and close the door.
You sure?
I might punch you, too.
I'll take my chances.
If this is where you want me
to apologize for my husband,
I'm not gonna do it.
Maybe he shouldn't have hit you,
but you provoked him.
Now wait a minute...
No! I'm sorry, Tom gets punished
because you can't deal
with your screwed-up marriage.
It is pathetic, Ed.
If you had stood up
to your wife in the first place,
none of this... what?
I love it.
You're giving me crap
about my marriage.
You know what? Here!
Oh, the forensic accountant
found some interesting stuff
in Tom's expense reports.
Yeah, it seems
on his last three trips east,
he cashed in
his first-class ticket
and took a detour to Atlantic City.
What? That can't be right.
Well, it's all there.
Hotels, bar tabs...
oh, and on this page...
two tickets to a show.
And flowers.
That doesn't make any sense.
There's gotta be some
kind of an explanation for this.
Before you pass judgment
on someone else's marriage,
I'd clean up
my own house first.
Sorry, I don't know
what's taking Danielle so long to get dressed.
Just give her a break, mom.
I'm sure she's just trying
to look nice for our company.
Well, I hope she doesn't get
too dressed up.
I like people to be comfortable.
Oh, I'm comfortable.
Honey, what are you wearing?
You got me this for Christmas.
Don't you remember?
Yes, I just... I'm worried
you might be a little cold.
Oh, I think
it's plenty warm in here.
Don't you, Mr. McMillan?
Uh... sure.
Well, uh, we should
probably start eating.
We don't want
our frittatas to get cold.
Right. Good. Um, sorry.
Everybody, dig in.
Does anybody else think
this salsa's a little too spicy?
I always say,
the hotter, the better.
So, Mr. McMillan, I hear
you went to Perkins college.
I'm thinking about going there
after I graduate.
Uh, Perkins, huh?
I was there.
Yeah, I made it to every party,
and I went to classes
in my spare time.
No, actually, it's a great college.
I think you'd like it.
Isn't this wonderful?
Good food,
pleasant conversation...
this really is
a very special night.
I feel the same way.
So, Peter, is it growing?
What?
Uh, the campus. Has it grown
at all since you've been there?
Uh...
yeah, it's, uh...
it's grown...
con-considerably.
I would just love
to get my hands on a brochure.
The alumni association
is always sending me stuff,
you know.
I'll... I'll get you something!
Oh my God, are you okay?
I just remembered, you know,
this guy I'm sponsoring...
he said he needed to see me
tonight, so I should go to him.
Well, I guess
that's important, so...
Yeah, so I should go.
No need to show me out.
What a shame.
I really wanted him
to have a chance
to get to know you guys.
Don't worry, I...
I think we made an impression.
Hey. Hey!
I didn't know
if you were coming back.
I waited until
the parking lot cleared.
So, um...
what happened?
You said you were just gonna
go in there and talk to him.
I know, I know.
I know I shouldn't have hit him.
But...
what's done is done.
Anything else going on?
Like what?
I don't know.
Anything you wanna talk about?
'Cause there's nothing
you couldn't tell me.
I would understand.
No, I feel good about this.
It's okay, 'cause I didn't
fit in around here anyway.
I'm gonna get another job
someplace else.
Everything's good.
And you, I love.
I love you, too.
You know what's weird?
No, what?
In all the years
we have been married,
I have never seen you
lead with your fists.
Well...
maybe I still got
some surprises in me.
Maybe you do.
Is it done?
Mm-hmm.
We can mourn
your brother later.
Right now there are things
that still need to be done.
We need to get rid
of everything...
mattress, clothes,
all of it.
Mom, the... the door's locked.
I know.
Mom, you need
to open this door right now!
Mom!
Honey,
why aren't you dressed yet?
We have to be
at the fertility clinic
in 40 minutes!
Aw, shoot! Is that today?
And, uh, give Xiao-Mei
a kick in the pants.
I haven't seen her all morning.
Hey.
Today's the, uh, big day.
You ready to, uh, make a baby?
Ready.
Please...
be gentle.
Honey, come on.
We're gonna be late.
Hmm, uh...
I think she's confused
as to how we're gonna
make this baby happen.
Oh. And were you planning
on setting her straight?
Next thing out of my mouth.
Come on!
The guy's ready to explode.
I don't care. I'm not
sleeping with mom's boyfriend.
You can't back out now.
You were great the other night.
You got Peter on the hook. He's primed.
I was just messing with his head
to get back at mom.
That's all.
Yeah, but why stop there?
She's keeping you from Matthew.
Now, come on,
she deserves this.
I'm not that stupid.
Go grind your own ax.
That's him.
I don't have time for this crap.
Now strip down to your bra and panties now.
Get out of my room, you psycho!
Um, my mom won't be back
for a while,
so you probably don't wanna wait around.
Well, that's okay.
I just wanted to make sure
you got the Perkins catalog.
Uh, your mom told me that you're
going on a tour there tomorrow.
Yeah.
You're gonna love it.
The campus is beautiful,
the teachers are amazing,
and the student body
is such a great mix.
You know,
they're all about diversity.
Whatever.
All right, well, I'll let
my mom know you stopped by.
Okay.
Andrew...
I also wanted to apologize
for leaving so fast
the other night.
I...
I started
to get the feeling
that your sister
was coming on to me,
which was upsetting because...
You're a sex addict?
Your mom told you about that?
Let's just say the word's out.
But, um, I'm curious.
Back in the day, what kind
of stuff were you into?
I don't know that
I wanna talk about that.
Well, I just wanna make sure
you're not into anything
too freaky.
You know, I mean,
you are dating my mom,
and I'm kinda protective of her.
Well, you can relax.
I mean, I wasn't some
sort of pervert, you know.
All I can say is...
I went through a dark period,
and I slept with
a whole lot of people.
People?
What's wrong?
No, it's just that when most
guys discuss their conquests,
they don't say "people. "
Oh, well...
No, it's okay.
I appreciate the fact
that you value...
diversity.
Who is it?
Mike.
Susan?
Hi. Sorry.
I'm just on the lookout for Edie.
Oh, well, you can relax.
Edie won't be coming after you.
Why?
I talked to the PI, and he's not gonna tell her anything.
What did you say?
I paid him off, so it's over.
I just thought you should know.
Well, wait.
Why would you do that?
People will just get hurt
if it gets out.
I didn't see the point.
Uh... oh...
Come on, come on, come on.
Hey there.
You look thirsty.
This is really nice of you,
Mrs. Mayer.
To be honest with you,
I wasn't even sure that you liked me.
And you know why?
Because we're all so busy
and detached from each other.
You're at my house every day,
and sure,
we wave and we say hello,
but we barely even
know each other.
How long have you
been delivering my mail,
for God's sake?
Three and a half weeks.
Really?
It seems like forever.
Let me top you off.
Oh, no, I couldn't.
This is my third glass. I...
Seriously, I'm sloshin'.
Well, you probably wanna use
the bathroom before you leave, huh?
No, I'm good.
Are you sure?
Uh, I mean,
you have such a long route,
and that ice tea's
gonna go right through ya.
It's better here than
Mrs. McCluskey's hydrangeas.
Well, you know, uh...
maybe I will use your bathroom.
Great! Oh, the one
down here is broken.
Why don't you use
the one upstairs?
It's right off my bedroom.
Yeah.
Okay.
Got it.
I still can't believe it.
I mean, why would Xiao-Mei
just offer herself up to me like that?
Well, honey, she's a virgin.
Who knows why virgins
do anything?
She's a virgin?
Are you serious?
Yeah. I wouldn't just
slam her for no reason.
Mr. Solis?
It's time to collect your DNA.
Oh! Okay, honey,
only good swimmers now.
If you like,
we have a variety of magazines
and videos available.
Mm... I think I'm good.
Gus? Are you okay up there?
Gus!
Uh, do you want me
to keep the hat on?
I know it's a fantasy
for some women.
Uh...
Mom?
Is the mailman here?
That's my daughter.
Get dressed!
Mom?
Yes, honey!
Gus the mailman is here!
He's using the bathroom.
He'll be down in a minute.
Oh! Darn it.
Guess we'll have
to take a rain check, huh?
I can come back on Tuesday.
Tu-tuesday?
No, no, Tuesday's not good,
'cause Tuesday's
the day I, um...
become a lesbian.
Andrew?
Honey, where are you?
I got your message.
What's the emergency?
Andrew?
Honey, what are you doing
in my bed?
Have you seen my pants?
I can't...
Now we're even.
Did you forget
that we're supposed to take
that tour
of Perkins college today?
Seriously?
After last night, I didn't
exactly think you'd be too keen
on sitting next to me
in a car for three hours.
Consider me a cheerleader
for anything that expedites me
getting you out from
under my roof.
Glad we can come
to an understanding.
Why'd we stop here?
We have half a tank left.
There's so many things
I wanna say to you, Andrew.
But mostly, I just want you
to know how sorry I am.
Sorry for what?
Every child deserves
to be loved unconditionally,
and I thought that was the kind
of love that I had for you.
Maybe if I had,
it would've been different.
Why do I
suddenly get the feeling
we're not gonna make it out
to Perkins college today?
What are you doing?
I packed up some of your things.
There's also, um, an envelope
in here with some money,
and that should tide you over
until you get a job.
What, you're gonna leave me out
here in the middle of nowhere?
I noticed a bus stop
about a mile back.
You can go anywhere you want.
Mama, mom,
please don't do this.
I have to.
I can't be around you anymore.
I'm just not strong enough.
You know what
the good news is?
I win.
You win?
I remember the look in your eyes
when I told you I was gay,
and I knew that one day
you would stop loving me.
So here we are.
I was right
and I... I win.
Well, good for you.
Hi. I made you
a thank-you pie,
and by "made,"
I mean "bought. "
So what exactly
are you thanking me for?
For keeping Edie
from smashing my face in.
That's the nicest thing
anybody ever did for me.
Just... trying
to keep peace on the lane.
Well, you keep
telling yourself that.
I know why
you really paid that guy off.
You still care about me.
What?
You're always worried
about Julie and me,
and you beat up
my new boyfriend.
And now you're
protecting me from Edie.
Do you know
what all that means?
That you're high maintenance?
All right, you go ahead
and be coy. Fine.
I'll be the one
to break the ice.
I've never stopped
caring about you.
Is that why
you jumped in bed with Karl?
I would've
never even gone there
if I had thought
there was a chance with us.
You just closed the door
so completely, I...
Ugh, can we just not
talk about him?
Have some more pie.
I know you like pie.
I know you like me.
Listen...
I'm not asking
for us to get back together.
I just want us to be friends.
Susan?
Yes?
Your house is on fire.
My whole house is... on fire!
When the truth is ugly,
people try to keep it hidden,
because they know if revealed,
the damage it will do.
So they conceal it
within sturdy walls...
or they place it
behind closed doors...
or they obscure it
with clever disguises.
But truth, no matter how ugly,
always emerges...
and someone we care about
always ends up getting hurt...
and someone else
will revel in their pain,
and that's the ugliest truth of all.
Previously on "Desperate Housewives"...
It seems on his last three trips east,
he cashed in his first class ticket
and took a detour to Atlantic City.
Lynette received some disturbing news...
He said it was okay for me to kiss her.
What else did your brother tell you?
Caleb revealed a secret...
Susan made a first class confession...
You're going to leave me out here
in the middle of nowhere?
I can't be around you anymore.
I'm just not strong enough.
And Bree made the most difficult
decision of her life.
Susan Mayer had always believed
the one good thing about hard times
is that you get to find out
who your friends really are.
When her grandmother died,
it was Bree who brought homemade cookies.
When the critics panned her third book,
it was Gabrielle who hired
the handsome masseur.
When her divorce became final,
it was Lynette who poured the scotch.
Sadly, Susan's life had been shattered once again.
But as always,
Her friends had come to help pick up the pieces.
Susan? We've all been talking.
We've decided you and Julie
should stay with Bree.
Oh, thanks. No, that's okay.
We'll stay at a motel.
Absolutely not.
Just give me an hour or two
to straighten up Andrew's room,
and then you can bring your... selves over.
I don't deserve friends like you.
We're aware of that.
Susan, you're running low on trash bags.
I'm going to run to the store.
Thanks, Orson. Thanks for coming.
You know, you didn't have to do this.
Hey, it's my pleasure.
Mrs. Mayer!
Hi. Bud Penrod,
Town and country insurance.
The "can do" people.
Oh, it's nice to meet you.
Yeah. Look at that.
Well, that's no fun at all, is it?
No. No, it isn't.
So when am I gonna get the check?
'Cause I have a lot of rebuilding to do.
I need to get started.
Yeah, well, I'm afraid
that's going to be a while.
You see, the fire department
has ruled that this was arson.
Arson?
Yeah. So we can't give you any money
until we finish our investigation.
Who would wanna burn down my house?
I don't know.
Do you have any enemies?
No. No, look at it.
The whole neighborhood turned out to help.
I'm very popular.
And there's no one among them
that wishes you ill?
Oh, no, no. Everybody's been very helpful.
Um, everybody likes me. Absolutely...
everyone.
Yes, hard times were what Susan used
to distinguish who was a friend
and who wasn't.
2x22:
No One Is Alone
Not everyone enjoys being a small part
of a large community.
Indeed, some yearn to leave the stress and noise
of constant companionship behind them.
So they strike out on their own,
hoping their solitude will bring
a little peace and quiet.
It's only then they discover
how dangerous it is
to be alone in the world.
Zach, did you get the trash?
How'd you get in here?
Hiya, Paul.
I stood at the back door shouting and shouting.
Were you in the little boys' room?
I'm calling the police.
No need.
I just needed to borrow some flour.
I'm a little bit psychic,
and I predict fresh-baked
cookies in your future.
Zachary.
What'd she want?
She was in the cupboard.
Get a trash bag.
We're throwing everything away.
You think she was trying to poison us?
All I know is we're eating out tonight.
What do you want?
Uh... this is a little awkward, and I apologize in advance
for how this is gonna sound, but, um...
By any chance, did... you burn down my house?
Yes.
What?
Yes, I burnt down your house, you sleazy little whore.
Edie! Why would you do that?!
Can you blame me,
after sending me that acid letter?
Letter? What letter?
The one where you admitted to
stabbing me in the back
by sleeping with Karl.
You weren't supposed to get that.
I stole that back from the mailman.
So you were trying
to hide the truth from me?
This is not what we should
focus on right now.
The point is, you maliciously
set fire to my house.
Look, I admit I might have...
overreacted a tad.
A tad? Edie, I have no roof!
You can't just go around
burning down people's homes.
Why not? You burnt down my home.
You stole Mike from me.
You slept with my fianc.
That's the trifecta.
You're lucky I didn't torch your car.
That's it. I'm going to the police,
and I'm telling them what you did.
Did what? I didn't do anything.
What? You just confessed.
No, I didn't.
Did anyone else hear me confess?
Hello?
Hello?
No witnesses.
No evidence, no confession.
I guess we're done here.
You can go home now.
Oh, wait. That's right.
You don't have one.
No, no, Xiao-Mei,
I've told you a million times.
No red meat for Mr. Solis.
My triglycerides are through the roof.
Mm. Sweetie, I need some more cream.
Xiao-Mei, what's wrong?
She smell.
Who smells? Gaby?
Excuse me. What?
Her perfume... make me sick.
Honey, it's 100 bucks an ounce.
That tends to make everyone
a little nauseous.
Xiao-Mei, your boobs...
are they tender?
Mm-hmm.
Carlos! Her boobs are
none of your business.
Gaby, think. She's sensitive to smell,
nauseous and has swollen breasts.
Well, I just ran her blood work.
It looks like the insemination was successful.
Oh!
Oh, my God. We're gonna have a baby!
Now, you should know,
since she's experiencing early symptoms,
this might be a tough pregnancy for her.
Not a problem.
We are gonna treat her like a queen!
Absolutely. You have nothing
to worry about here.
Oh, Mrs. Solis, you smell.
Oh, yeah. Okay. Sorry.
I think it's gonna be a kick
having Susan and Julie stay with us.
It'll be like living in a sorority.
We'll stay up late
and we'll gossip and make smors.
Doesn't that sound like fun?
Why are you pretending to be happy?
I heard you walking
around your room all night long...
crying.
I don't want to talk about it.
Look, I know why you're worried,
but Andrew can take care of himself,
and if he can't,
he shouldn't have run away
in the first place.
You know what?
Maybe Andrew leaving will be good for us.
You are all I have left, and I am gonna be
the best mother that I can be.
There's definitely room for improvement.
It's just...
You kinda forgot my birthday.
What?
Yeah. It was six weeks ago.
Oh, my God, Danielle. I am so sorry.
It's okay. You had a lot going on.
I mean, Andrew was suing you,
and you were pretty wasted that month.
Honey, you've gotta let me
make it up to you.
I I'm gonna throw you a birthday party
with all your friends, okay?
That could be cool.
You know what else I'd like?
Name it. It's yours.
I want Andrew's room.
You said he's probably not coming back,
and I could really use
the extra closet space.
But, sweetheart, this is...
this is his room.
Mom, you forgot my birthday.
You're really in no position to negotiate.
Honey, where am I gonna put
all of his things?
And, you know, he might
come back at some point.
He won't.
Like you said, I'm all you have left.
Atlantic City?
Yeah, it's last minute,
but Jerry got a great deal
on a suite at one of the casinos,
and a bunch of the old gang
is coming in from New York,
and God, it's been forever since I have been,
so how could I turn that down?
Yeah, how, indeed?
What?
I didn't say anything.
No, but you have that look.
Is something wrong?
No!
Except that I know
you've been to Atlantic City
three times in the last month
without telling me.
Ed found the receipts
when he did the office audit.
Other than that, no, nothing's wrong.
Tom, it would be better
for your general well-being
if you did not laugh
at this moment in time.
Am I gonna have to ruin the surprise?
Because it's a really good surprise.
I'm thinking, yeah, ruin it.
I have been going to
Atlantic City for business.
I am up for a top spot with Jerry's firm,
Huffington Promotions.
And if you don't believe me...
you can call the CEO himself.
I am so happy and I'm so relieved.
Did you think I was cheating?
No! Absolutely not.
Lynette.
No! Okay, a little bit.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Ed found receipts for flowers
and theater tickets.
I mean, by the way, did you...
Jerry and I went to a show,
and the flowers were for Milt's wife.
I knew that.
You didn't have to tell me that.
Why did you buy flowers for Milt's wife?
Lynette...
Sorry. Stop. Done talking.
That's fantastic.
I love you!
I love you.
Carlos...
What's going on?
Xiao-Mei is feeling under the weather,
so I took up the vacuuming.
Oh, well, I'm sorry to hear that.
So, uh, did you move my beauty products?
They're not in the bathroom.
Why in the hell?
I forgot to tell you.
Uh, you can't use that stuff anymore.
It really triggers
Xiao-Mei's morning sickness.
All of it? Even my hair pomade?
Gives me stomachache.
Yeah, well, it gives me volume,
so I guess we're both
gonna have a problem.
Do you have to be so high-maintenance?
You're not a model, Carlos.
Maintenance is my only skill.
Please, no fight.
If Mrs. Solis smell bad, I be okay.
Fine. I'll learn to live without product.
But when my hair starts smelling like hair,
I don't wanna hear a word.
Surprise!
What the hell is that?
Isn't it darling? I made it for your party.
It's a big "1" and a big "7"...
For "17."
Were you up all night making that thing?
Yeah. I just wasn't tired.
Oh, I wanna show you
what else I've planned.
I think you're gonna love it.
You got a fajita bar and a juggler?
No, relax. He's a very hip juggler.
He only performs to Beatles songs,
and I saw the video,
and it's absolutely thrilling.
Mom, I don't want any of this stuff.
It's not even my real birthday.
Danielle, I just want you to have the best party
you have ever had in your entire life.
I just want a few friends
to come over and hang out.
You can make a cake,
but giant balloon numbers?
I mean, come on.
They would all make fun of me.
Oh.
Okay.
Is that really necessary?
Honey, I can't possibly
put it in the garbage as is.
It's just another morning
with the Van De Kamps.
Oh, Susan, did I wake you?
Uh, no. No, I was up.
Well, I'm sorry about the noise.
It's just that Danielle doesn't want balloons,
and I'm kind of pressed for time.
Bree... are you okay?
She said she doesn't want balloons.
I'm fine.
Mom?
Look, I know you're out there.
Please, just talk to me.
Mom, I need something to drink.
Just some water, some juice.
Something, anything. Please.
Mom!
You want me to say that I set Caleb up?
Yeah, I did it.
I started thinking about all those years.
Years that we had to take care of him, and...
I just thought maybe once he was gone,
we could have a normal life.
And I'm sorry.
But, mom, you have got
to let me out of here now.
Damn you!
You were willing to stand by
and let me murder
your brother without reason.
That's an unforgivable betrayal.
I am so consumed with rage,
it's best you stay in there,
because if I let you out
I don't know what I might do to you.
Hello?
I need Edie to spill her guts.
What do you know about wearing a wire?
So you see the little red light?
Mmh.
It's all voice-activated,
so if the light's on, you're recording.
Uh, let me show you how to tape it on.
Oh, okay.
Sorry if my hands are cold.
Um... no, that's okay. They're fine.
So you sure you wanna do this?
Yeah. I'm sort of up against the wall.
The insurance company needs proof fast,
and things are sort of weird at Bree's.
I don't wanna overstay my welcome.
Well, if things get tough,
you can always stay here.
Testing, testing.
I'm sorry. Did you just invite me
to move in with you?
Well, you and Julie in the spare bedroom.
Oh.
You've...
You've been saying
how you want to be friends again,
and you're right.
There's no reason we can't be friends.
You sure that won't put a crimp
in your, uh, dating life?
You know, that girl you were
at the movies with?
No. That was a one-time thing.
But what about that guy, though?
Orson.
Yeah, he just heard about the fire
and came over to help. We're friends.
Oh. So... neither of us is dating anybody.
Guess not.
I got my boarding pass.
Do what you need to do
and don't worry about the kids.
I'll keep 'em out of trouble.
Is this crazy?
Following Tom across the country
just to spy on him?
If he knew I was doing this...
God, I don't think
I can go through with this.
Now, look, there's probably nothing going on,
but you need to know the truth.
Do I? I'm happy.
I mean, I was.
Why don't I just look the other way
and pretend nothing's wrong?
Lots of women can do that.
But we both know
you're not one of them.
And what if I see him
with another woman? What then?
I own a gun.
You okay here?
I'm fine. Why?
It's just, people have been
asking about the cake,
and you've been icing it
for over an hour.
Well, I just keep messing it up.
I don't know what's wrong with me.
You're probably just tired.
My mom and I heard you up all night.
It just keeps coming out too thick.
You know, people aren't gonna care
if the icing isn't perfect.
People care about details.
Someday when Danielle looks back,
I want her to remember
just how perfect her cake looked
and how hard her mother worked
to make her happy.
This cake is a symbol of my love.
Well, it looks delicious.
# Happy birthday to you,
# happy birthday to you.
# Happy birthday, dear Danielle...
Stop! One of the candles went out.
Um, we're gonna have
to do this all over again.
I'm sorry. I'll be right back.
Mom, it's all right.
Sweetheart, this is your special day.
All of your candles should be lit.
It'll just take me two seconds.
Is she serious?
Welcome to my own private hell.
That is some serious frosting.
All righty.
Who touched this?
Mom, what is the matter?
It's just a little frosting.
Somebody ruined your cake,
and I wanna know
who could be that thoughtless.
Was it you? Or you?!
Who was it?
Mom, please, you're embarrassing me.
You. You look like a girl
who enjoys her frosting.
No! No, I didn't touch it.
It's just a cake, for God's sake.
Will you please just cut it?
Mrs. Van De Kamp...
Open your mouth.
I wanna smell your breath.
It wasn't me! It was Barbie.
Barbie!
What the hell is wrong with you?!
Now it's ruined! Everything is ruined!
Um...
You can just... leave that there,
and I'll, um... clean it up later.
Xiao-Mei, what are you doing in our bed?
I said she could sleep in there from now on.
It's got the bathroom.
You know, in case
she gets sick in the middle of the night.
Well, what's wrong with the guest bathroom?
It's too far away.
It's right down the hall.
Gaby, she needs her rest.
And besides, that bed is much more comfortable
than the one in the guest room.
Yeah, I know.
That's why I had the movers
put it in here, where we sleep.
Maybe I go to my bed.
Yes, Xiao-Mei, that would be good.
Uh-Oh.
Fine. You can use our toilet.
Ow! Stop kicking me.
I'm just trying to get comfortable.
Yeah, in a twin? Good luck.
God, I want my bed back.
We'll go buy a nice big one tomorrow
and put it in here, okay?
That is not the point. We are a week into this pregnancy,
and you're already putting
Xiao-Mei's needs before mine.
Well, she's the priority now.
She's the mother of my child.
Like hell she is. That is my egg.
You know what I mean. She's the...
Oven, Carlos. The oven.
A well-cared for, well-paid oven.
It came out wrong. I'm sorry, okay?
Now can we just get some sleep?
Ohh! Babe, I'm sorry.
I swear. I swear I didn't mean to.
My leg just cramped up.
Where are you going?
That's my pillow!
Good night.
Matthew!
Mom, come on.
Oh, my God. What are you doing in there?
Danielle, is that you?
My mom found out what we did to Caleb.
She flipped out and locked me in here.
Don't worry. I'll get you out.
Be really careful, okay?
Please, okay?
I've never seen her like this before.
She's seriously lost it this time.
I know a little something about psycho moms.
Trust me, I'll be fine.
Hey.
Cleaning up after the big party?
Yeah.
You know, it's late.
Why don't you, uh, go to bed
and, you know,
let Julie and I help you
with that in the morning?
Oh, that's okay. I can't sleep anyway.
Are you... okay?
I take it you heard what happened.
Yeah, when you flip out
in front of the pep squad,
word travels fast.
It was the oddest sensation.
I was fine, and everything was fine,
and then suddenly
I was on the outside of my body
watching a woman who looked like me
becoming a raving maniac.
Bree, I'm worried about you.
Do you think that you should see someone?
Oh, no, I'm fine.
I'm just tired, that's all.
I just need a long rest,
and then I'm gonna be as good as new.
Okay, well, then why don't you stop
and go to bed?
Because, um, I can't sleep just yet.
Why not?
Because when I sleep, I dream,
and when I dream, I keep seeing
Andrew's face in that rearview mirror.
Okay, what are you talking about?
Andrew, um...
didn't run away.
I, um, dropped him off
in the middle of nowhere,
told him that I couldn't
be around him anymore,
and then...
I drove off.
So I just need a little time
to forget what I've done,
and then I can sleep again.
Hey.
You know, I am not even tired.
So... why don't I stay up
and help you?
That would be nice.
Hello?
Hey, you. How you doing?
Hey! Great.
Great. How's Atlantic City?
Are you, um, winning some money?
Oh, I'm about even.
Actually, I'm heading back
into the casino right now
to try my luck again.
Yeah?
You're quite a gambler.
Where's Jerry?
Uh, Jerry?
He-he's right here.
Hey, honey, how are the kids?
Great. Great.
They're in the day care room.
I'm... looking at 'em right now.
Hey, why don't you
walk in there and, um,
put 'em on the phone with me
so I can say hi?
Okay. Sure.
First, can I talk to Jerry?
Why do you wanna talk to Jerry?
Well, just, you know, say hello.
It's been a long time.
Wow, man, that is weird.
Can you hear-
do you hear that car alarm?
Uh... no.
It's strange, because I can hear it here
and through the phone.
Whoa. That's weird
kind of feedback, you know?
Physics can be spooky that way.
Listen, I gotta go. I gotta go.
Ed is talking to me, and, um,
I'll call you back later?
Um, okay.
Okay, bye.
Bye, honey.
9-1-1. Is this an emergency?
I think so.
My neighbor, Paul Young,
has been threatening me.
Is he there right now?
No.
Ma'am, until he actually does
something, there's nothing we can do.
Well, I won't live in fear anymore.
If you people refuse to confront him,
I guess I'll just have to do it myself.
No, Edie, wait.
Um, I don't wanna fight.
I know that we've had our differences,
but, you know,
we had a friendship going there,
and I just think we owe it to ourselves
to talk about what happened.
What's there to talk about?
It happened.
I walked down to your house,
I had a watering can...
What?
filled it with gasoline and...
Boom! Laughed my ass off.
Okay, wait.
Could you just swallow?
'Cause I couldn't really...
what you were saying...
And that was basically it.
One of the best days of my life.
Well, see, you were chewing,
and so I didn't really hear what you said.
Could you just say it again?
I burnt your house down.
It was great. What do you want?
So, uh, y-you then a-admit
burning down my house on purpose?
You're wearing a wire, aren't you?
Huh?
Open that blouse.
What? No.
Open that blouse!
Aah!
You can't outrun me, Mayer!
I'm in the best shape of my life!
Well, good, then you'll be
prime meat picking
when you go to jail!
You give it!
Bite me!
Aha!
No! No!
Ow!
What the hell?
Nine months of long nights
on the couch loomed before Gabrielle.
And she had decided
she would not take it lying down.
So she dipped into her
supply of forbidden perfumes...
determined that in this battle...
she would be the one
to come out smelling like a rose.
I think I take nap now.
Yeah, sure, knock yourself out.
Aah!
Honey?
Boys?
Anybody home?
Hey, Mrs. McCluskey, excuse me.
You haven't seen Lynette around, have you?
She's not home.
She's not answering her cell phone.
She packed up the kids
and the puppy and left.
Packed 'em up? Why?
She followed you to Atlantic City.
She knows about your other woman.
Boy, you're just lucky
you're not my husband.
Hi.
Okay, first, let me say,
I'm really sorry about the yellowjackets.
And... also, no matter how mad
I am about what you did,
I don't want to see you go to prison.
So I came with a solution.
Why don't you just come forward
and tell the police
that you saw some vagrant lurking
by my garage with a can of gasoline?
And if you do that,
then I'll destroy the tape.
And then the insurance company
will pay the claim.
Nobody gets hurt.
Does that sound good?
Come closer.
Oh, uh...
Take your stinking deal and shove it.
Edie...
Every time something bad happens
to me, you're standing nearby.
Well, I've had it.
No more pretending to be friends.
When I get outta here,
I'm gonna destroy you.
Okay, I'm just gonna think
that this is the meds talking,
and I'll come back tomorrow.
Don't bother.
Okay, Edie, I'm in trouble here.
Oh, I'm sure you'll turn on
the waterworks,
and the whole neighborhood
will come running.
They always do.
That's not true.
Sure, it is.
You never miss an opportunity
to play the victim.
And you think just because everybody
always comes to your rescue,
it means that you're loved.
Well, it doesn't.
It means that you're helpless.
Now get out.
Just get out.
Hey there.
Hi.
So, you've given any thought
to staying at my place?
Oh, yeah, that. Um...
Look, I really appreciate the offer,
but I think I'm gonna have to pass.
Really?
Yeah.
I think it's best.
I don't wanna get a rep around here
for being a charity case, you know?
Well, I didn't mean it that way.
Just one friend helping out another.
I know, but I can figure this out
on my own.
At least I'm gonna try.
You know, I'm stronger
than people give me credit for.
I really am.
Well, if there's anything I can do...
You know what would be nice?
Why don't you just stop over
for coffee sometime?
Okay.
I mean, that is after I get
running water and electricity again.
And a coffeemaker.
I hope you're happy.
That poor girl can hardly even
come upstairs now because of you.
Carlos, stop with the dance.
It's already in the wallpaper.
Now I swear, if anything happens
to that kid because of you...
Oh, it's perfume, not toxic gas.
Why are you acting this way?
Because I see the writing on the wall,
and it scares the hell out of me.
Meaning what?
From the second Xiao-Mei got pregnant,
you have found a million and one ways
to tell me that
that baby is more important to you than me.
Oh, come on, Gaby.
No! Men can't help it.
When they become fathers,
they become lousy husbands.
And some wives don't mind,
but you didn't marry one of those women.
I don't think I can sleep in here tonight.
The air's just a little too toxic.
She kick you out, too?
Marriage is complicated, Xiao-Mei.
You'll find that out someday.
You feel like watching
some trashy American TV?
I make you sandwich.
Roast beef.
Oh, man.
Gaby's got me on this health kick thing.
She'll kill me if I eat red meat.
I will not tell.
Taste good?
Real good.
Matthew, wake up.
I have your breakfast.
I might be furious with you,
but never let it be said that I'm cruel.
I advise you not to charge this door,
because I am not in the mood
for any unpleasantness.
Matthew?
Matthew!
Aah!
Jeez, Danielle! I thought you were
just gonna steal the key.
Let's just get out of here.
Mother, Matthew and I are running away
together and we're never coming back.
If you want me to be happy,
you won't try to find us.
Living in that house with you
was like being in a prison.
You drove me to do this,
so I hope you'll blame yourself.
Have a nice life. Danielle.
Hello.
My name is Bree Van De Kamp,
and I'd like to admit myself
for psychiatric observation.
All right,
what seems to be the problem?
I think I'm about to have
a nervous breakdown.
Damn it!
What the hell?
That psychotic bitch.
There was no confrontation.
Felicia Tillman's the one
who made the call.
She's the anonymous tip.
Let's just go over there right now.
I guarantee you, the woman is having
a cocktail, laughing her ass off.
We're not going anywhere yet, sir.
Yes, I know there's blood everywhere.
She probably got it from a pig
so she can vandalize everything I own.
Sergeant.
What is it?
Put your hands where I can see 'em.
Oh, man, she's good.
It's a shocking moment for each of us,
that moment we realize
we are all alone in this world.
The family we take for granted
could one day abandon us.
The husband we trust so implicitly
might betray us.
The daughter we love so deeply
perhaps won't return to us.
And then we could end up all by ourselves.
Of course, some see great value
in going it alone.
For example...
Sorry about the dust, Mrs. Huber.
We don't get too many tourists
this far up the mountain.
First snows come
and this place is completely cut off.
Dropping off the face of the earth,
now that's what I call a vacation.
I'm sorry.
Oh.
Sometimes I'm just all thumbs.
Previously on "Desperate Housewives"...
She packed up the kids
and the puppy and left.
Packed them up? Why?
She followed you to Atlantic City.
She knows about your other woman.
Things went from bad...
Put your hands where I can see them.
...to considerably worse.
Man, she's good.
Looks like the
insemination was successful.
Oh!
Oh my God!
And even the good news...
She's the priority now.
She's the mother of my child!
...came with a catch.
Given any thought to
staying at my place?
I think I'm gonna have to pass.
No, I'm stronger than
people give me credit for.
But sometimes, once
you accept the truth...
you discover that you're capable...
Let's just get out of here!
...of accomplishing...
I'd like to admit myself
for psychiatric observation.
I'm about to have a nervous breakdown.
...almost anything.
It's a fact of life
in every neighborhood:
People move in, and people move out.
Although very few of them pack up
and leave at 2 o'clock in the morning.
But it wasn't the first time
that Betty Applewhite had tried
to leave in the middle of the night.
It had happened once before, in Chicago.
The same night one of her sons tried
to break up with his girlfriend,...
...a young woman named Melanie Foster.
Are you kidding? You cannot dump me!
I do not get dumped!
If anyone is getting
dumped here, it's you.
However you want to
spell it, it's fine. OK?
I just want out. I just want out!
OK. Matthew...
maybe I am a bitch sometimes, but there
are advantages to dating someone like me.
And I know that you know
what I'm talking about.
Melanie, my mother is in the
other room. Are you crazy?
Clearly, we can't have a
serious discussion here.
Why don't you meet me at
the lumberyard at nine?
Melanie, it's over.
Well, even more reason
for you to show up.
No one can say goodbye better than I do.
Oh, it's about time.
Caleb!
What are you doing here?
Where's Matthew?
I got here first.
I know a shortcut.
Does Matthew know that you're here?
No.
He... he doesn't want
to be with you anymore.
What does that have to do with you?
See, I thought...
maybe I could be your boyfriend now.
What?
I love you.
Oh God, please tell me
someone put you up to this! No?
Could you be serious?
It's too pathetic!
What the hell are you doing?
Get off of me, you...!
Melanie?
Yes, a year had come and gone since
the Applewhites had left Chicago.
And Betty thought they could again
slip away in the middle of the night.
Once we move,
how's Matthew goin' to find us?
Caleb, I think this is going
to be you and me from now on.
Up with your hands! Put your hands up!
But as she soon discovered,
it's not that easy to
slip away in the suburbs.
Because in suburbia, once
the neighbors hear you going,
they all insist on showing up...
to say goodbye.
2x23 + 2x24:
Remember
Everyone must choose the
road they will take in life.
And for a special few,
that road would lead to Wisteria Lane.
They all arrive the exact same way:
driving up in their overloaded trucks,
bringing with them
their expensive antiques
and ordinary dreams.
I remember the first moment
I saw each of them.
I met Susan Mayer the day
she moved to Wisteria Lane.
Ah! OK, break time's over.
She seemed so delightfully confident,
I couldn't help but feel intimidated.
Oh! Oh!
That feeling quickly passed.
Help! Can anybody hear me?
Julie? I need you to try
to unlock the door!
Oh, what am I thinking, she's too...
OK... I need you to unbuckle yourself
and try to find a neighbor!
But don't cross the street!
Just tell the neighbor that your
mommy's stuck in a big truck!
Oh, yes! My God, I have a genius baby!
Hi.
I have a normal baby.
I'm Mary Alice.
I live across the street.
Susan Mayer. Thank you so much!
If my husband had had to rescue me,
I would have never heard the end of it.
He thinks I'm a total klutz.
Oh, please, that's what neighbors are for.
Well, welcome to Wisteria Lane.
When you're finished unpacking,
why don't you come over
for a cup of coffee?
Oh, wow!
I have a neighbor who just
asked me over for coffee.
I'm sorry. You must think I'm a lunatic.
Oh, no, no, I don't.
I think you're charming.
And your baby looks like a genius to me.
Oh, she is.
And we're gonna be so happy here.
Look at your new home.
You're not gonna walk
me into a wall, are you?
Of course not, but when you
see it for the first time,
I want you to get the whole impact.
Ta-da!
Okay, now I know it's
a little more cramped
than we're used to,
but we can't stay at Bree's forever.
She's gonna be coming back
from that spa vacation soon.
Besides, it's gonna be fun.
Why are you doing this to me?
I get good grades. I don't do drugs.
I've never come home pregnant.
Honey, I am trying my hardest
to stand on my own two feet.
All right, I've got six
book proposals in the works.
I'm gonna try to supervise
the rebuilding of this house,
but you know, I can't do
it without your support.
And I want you to be proud of me.
Fine. Let's take a look inside.
Ohh! That's my girl.
So... is there anything
you should prepare me for?
No! No, it's all good.
Oh! But you should know that your
bed doubles as the dining table,
and the toilet's in the shower.
Honey, look. I bought us matching
golf outfits for our lessons tomorrow.
Yeah, about that... I can't go.
I gotta pick up trash on the freeway.
I'm sorry?
I have to do my community service.
It's part of my parole, remember?
Oh, okay, well,
I'll just call the country club
and cancel our lessons.
No, no, no.
I can't, I paid already.
Might as well go without me.
I don't wanna go alone. It was
your idea in the first place.
And I'd love to be there with you, too,
if I didn't have to
scrape slushies and condoms
off route 57. Look, what's the big deal?
Just go take the stupid lesson.
Fine, if you feel that way about it.
Hey, I'm sorry.
I'm just... a little on edge today.
Oh, would you look at this crap?
He has been doing that all day.
Ralph has a little crush. So?
So can't I get a gardener who isn't
trying to sleep with someone in my house?
You pay 6 bucks an hour.
It's all about the perks, honey.
Susan, have you talked to Lynette?
Uh, no. Have you tried her cell?
Yeah, she isn't picking up.
Do you know where she is?
Uh, no, I'm sorry.
Susan, I think you do.
I really don't, Tom.
Is everything okay?
Yeah. Yeah, we just had a fight.
Listen, if you talk to her,
will you please ask her to call me?
Thank you.
Hello?
He was just here.
I think you should call him.
I can't. I can't.
I'm sorry, I just can't.
Mom!
Yeah. Hang on.
I'll call you later. Okay. Bye.
Yeah?
When is Daddy coming?
I wanna show him my dive.
He's not coming, sweetheart.
But you could show me.
You have to talk to Noah.
But he creeps me out.
Who cares?
This is my life we're talking about.
I need a big-time lawyer in my corner,
and where else are we gonna
get that kind of money?
Noah's not gonna give me a dime
if he knows it's for you.
He hates your guts.
Tell him it's for you.
Tell him you want a car.
Tell him you're ready for him
to buy your love. Trust me.
Dying men are nothing
if not sentimental.
Why do you need so much, anyway?
I thought only guilty men
needed expensive lawyers.
Felicia has obviously been
planning this for months.
Who knows what other kind
of evidence she's planted?
With my luck, they'll open up
the Martha Huber murder again,
try to nail me with some DNA.
You swore to me that you
had nothing to do with that.
I didn't.
Look, why are we arguing?
I'm your father.
Do what I'm telling you to do.
You're not my real father.
You ungrateful little...
I rescue you from that miserable junkie.
I give you a home, a life worth living,
and now you make me beg
for one lousy, little favor?
I need the money, Zach.
If you won't do it for me,
at least do it for your mother.
After all, she killed
herself trying to protect you.
I met Bree Van De Kamp the first
day she moved to Wisteria Lane.
There are certain people,
who, when you meet them,
can't help but make a
delightful first impression.
Hello. I'm Bree Van De Kamp,
your new neighbor.
Is this your frog?
Bree was not one of them.
Yes. Why?
Well, it seems that my son
stole it from your yard.
Oh, well, I don't mind.
If he likes it so much,
he's welcome to keep it.
Well, don't tell him that.
If he doesn't feel guilty,
he'll never learn shame.
Hey, what's going on?
Oh. Um, this is our new neighbor.
It seems her son accidentally
took my garden frog.
Oh.
Please don't make excuses for him.
That is exactly what
his father does. Rex!
This is my husband Rex.
Hi. We're not weird.
We just seem like we are.
And this is my son...
the criminal.
Go on.
I'm sorry I stole from you.
Just so you know, my mom did
teach me right from wrong,
so my actions should in no way
influence your opinion
of her as a parent.
Wow.
Well, is there anything you'd like to say to my son?
Feel free to be harsh.
No, I'm... I'm good.
Well, now that we've finished
with all this unpleasantness,
I want to assure you that we
are going to be good neighbors,
and I hope in time, great friends.
That sounds... lovely.
Come on.
Oh, wait. I'm-I'm sorry.
It was Rex, Andrew and...
what was your name again?
Bree?
What?
You're Bree Van De Kamp, right?
Do I know you?
Orson Hodge.
Uh, Susan's dentist friend.
We met after her house burned down.
Oh. I'm so sorry.
I didn't recognize you.
Small world, huh?
Yes. Uh, excruciatingly so.
Ah.
What are you doing here?
Well, three or four times a week,
I visit my... my friend.
What about you?
Oh, I just thought it'd be a lovely
place to take a nice, long rest.
Um, listen,
I told my friends that I was,
um, I was at a spa,
so if you run into Susan, I-
Your secret is safe.
And seriously...
I am not like these other people.
Oh, I can tell.
A real lady always
stands out in a crowd.
Well, that was... very sweet.
Enjoy your rest, Bree Van De Kamp.
Boy, do I feel for you.
Trying to convince your friends
that you're still normal,
and you're surrounded
by a bunch of loons.
You, too?
Oh, please.
Dr. Barr goes out of his way to make
me feel like a complete psychopath.
I think he's crazier than
the patients, actually.
You know that, um, that
woman in the wheelchair?
What's her story?
Yeah, she's a kooky one.
She hasn't spoken a
word since she got here.
She just sits there all day long
waiting for your friend to come and visit.
He talks to her for hours,
but I don't even think she can hear him.
Oh, hi.
You said to stop by for coffee sometime.
I got coffee.
So I can't believe you
caught me spraying for ants.
I must look like a wreck.
Actually, you look kinda sexy.
You've gotta be kidding.
Oh, the way you're taking charge...
it's impressive.
They're just ants, and they're tiny.
Of course, they do outnumber me.
Oh, you said you wanted
to handle things yourself,
and you're making it happen.
It's good to see.
Thanks.
Even if it does mean
you're not in the market
for a relationship right now.
Oh. Did I say that?
You certainly implied it.
Well, sometimes I say
things I don't mean.
I blame it on my frequent
exposure to ant spray.
What the hell is this?
Karl. What do you want?
Well, I can't believe
you're forcing our daughter
to live in a house with wheels.
I think we need to talk about this.
It's temporary,
and if you don't mind,
I'm having coffee.
Oh, it's okay, Susan.
Hey, sorry. I don't mean
to chase you out, buddy,
but, uh, this is really a family thing.
Oh, no, I understand.
Cool.
Mmm.
I'll call you later.
You've got a great swing.
You just need a little
help around the greens.
You know what they say, drive for
show, putt for dough. Am I right?
That is so true.
All right. I'll see you out there. Okay.
Make me something strong.
I have nine more holes with that guy.
Jim, it was just an hour ago that
the road crew working here on route 57
saw a member of their own
killed by oncoming traffic.
The victim was a Hispanic
male in his early 40s
who, for years, was a prominent
businessman in the area.
Police aren't releasing a name
until the next of kin can be notified.
We, of course, will keep you updated
on any late-breaking developments
as this tragic story unfolds.
Reporting live from route 57,
this is Craig Siyumina.
Back to you.
Mrs. Solis! Why you home?
Carlos is dead, Xiao-Mei.
No, please don't kill him.
No, you don't understand.
He's already dead.
There was an accident.
He's all over the highway.
No...
he in kitchen.
Hey, babe. Why you home so early?
Oh, honey! Oh, you're not dead!
Who said I was dead?
The police. They called me.
What are you talking about?
Honey, they didn't know all the details,
but a witness said that they saw you
run into the carpool lane to pick up a
lawn chair that had fallen off some truck,
and then a bus hit you right
in front of the road crew.
Why aren't you at the road crew?
I paid Ralph to go in my place.
What?
Well, Carlos, they had your name.
Oh, no. Poor Ralph.
Oh!
Why is your back all sweaty?
I was working out on the treadmill.
Barefoot?
For God's sakes, Gabrielle,
Ralph just died,
and you're worried about my feet?
I mean, what the hell is wrong with you?
My fault.
Sorry.
You must find that very peaceful.
Why would you assume that?
Because that's all you've
been doing for three sessions.
I still don't know anything about you,
except that you rake in
remarkably straight lines.
Is that what you're doing,
asking me all those ridiculous questions
about my childhood,
trying to get to know me?
Well, here's a clue. I'm not crazy.
I just have a few issues.
And psychotherapy is how we help you deal with those issues.
What kind of treatment did you think you were going to get?
Honestly, I was hoping
that you'd medicate the hell out of me.
You don't need anything stronger than
what I've already prescribed for you.
I have aspirin at home
that packs more of a punch.
It says here your husband died,
you had a boyfriend who killed himself,
and you suffer from alcoholism.
That's a lot of trauma for one year.
What about your kids?
Oh, they're fine.
Andrew is backpacking through Europe,
and Danielle is away
at cheerleading camp.
What's your relationship with them like?
What do you mean?
Are you close?
Do they share things with you?
What do you feel about them?
You know, I really don't
have time for this nonsense.
Are you going to give me
some serious drugs or not?
No.
Fine. Then I'm going back to my room.
You know, Bree, I can't
force you to open up to me,
but I can make it easier for
you to focus on your problems.
And how are you going to do that?
I'm going to tell the orderlies
to confiscate all your personal items.
I committed myself voluntarily.
When you signed those papers, I
became responsible for your well-being,
and I will help you in any way I see fit.
I don't need that much help,
because I am not like your other patients.
Oh, sure you are.
You just don't know it yet.
Your son confessed to murder.
We've got it on tape.
My son has the mind
of a child, detective.
He'd confess to sinking the Titanic.
This letter was sent some months ago
to the Chicago police,
saying the person they arrested
for the Melanie Foster
murder was innocent.
We have a hunch you wrote it.
Really? I didn't know hunches were
considered evidence in a court of law.
They aren't.
But this is.
We found some of the
assailant's DNA on this jacket.
Now all we need is a matching sample.
You, by any chance,
recognize the jacket?
It's not Caleb's.
You can try and deny it, but...
No.
You don't understand.
That jacket belongs to my other son.
And out of nowhere, he just attacked me.
My brother's never been violent.
I'm sure he didn't mean to hurt you.
But he did.
Let me just take you home.
This has been pretty traumatic for me.
I I think that you should come over for
the next few days so we can talk it out.
We broke up, Mel. It is not
my job to hold your hand.
Well, maybe I shouldn't
go home right away.
Maybe I should go to the cops first.
The cops?
I was attacked.
It's my civic duty to
report it, don't you think?
Mel, I just told you that Caleb did
not mean to do what he did, okay?
Melanie, please.
Screw you.
No, you cannot tell anybody about this!
I can tell who I want. Get your hands off me!
We're talking about my brother here!
Your brother is going to go
to jail for the next ten years,
so I say let go!
Hey, Melanie!
What?!
You leave my family alone!
We all met Lynette Scavo the day
she moved on to Wisteria Lane.
We quickly decided she
would be our friend,
mostly because we were afraid
to have her as an enemy.
... playing Russian roulette with my ovaries and...
Lynette!
Hi.
Hi.
Hi. Uh, we just wanted to come
welcome you to the neighborhood.
Um, but we could come back later.
Yeah.
No, wait. Actually, wait.
This is perfect.
You know why? Because we need some impartial judges.
Lynette...
Let's suppose your husband
begged you to get pregnant-
begged you and out of
the goodness of your heart,
you agreed, even though it
might derail your career.
You agreed to a baby.
A baby, singular.
Lynette, we've just met these people.
Then then you go in for an
ultrasound, and you hear two heartbeats.
Then and only then does
your husband tell you
that twins run in his family.
I didn't think it was that big a deal!
Your family had eight sets of
twins over three generations,
not to mention your relatives
in Kentucky with triplets!
Triplets! So I ask you,
do I not deserve to
punish this man severely?
Well, actually, I think that twins are
genetically determined by the mother.
What are you, a scientist?
No. No, I write children's books.
Um, we, uh, just came over
to introduce ourselves,
but we can, um, do that at another time.
No, wait. Please stay. It's okay.
We're okay. We're okay, right?
Honey, we don't wanna
freak out the new neighbors.
I'm sorry that you saw my panic attack.
I won't let it happen again,
especially since this
is my last pregnancy.
Right. You're the boss.
I'm just your love slave.
Aww.
Well, don't encourage him.
Honey, clearly, our
new neighbors consent
that you have been gifted
with a phenomenal husband.
Cannonball!
Guys?
Could you come here for a second?
We need to have a serious talk.
Okay, we have had a great... vacation,
but tomorrow we're going home.
Except we're not going to our home.
We're gonna go stay with grandma.
Is Dad gonna be there?
No, Dad is not gonna be there,
but he... he is gonna come
and see you guys all the time.
We are still gonna be a family.
It's just-
We won't be living in
the same place anymore.
So...
is there any questions you wanna ask me?
Can we go swimming now?
Cannonball!
Mike, what a surprise.
Yeah. How's it goin'?
Good, good. I'm...
just came in to get a
new battery for my watch.
So, whatcha doin'?
Oh, just buying
something for my grandma.
It's her 90th birthday.
Here we go.
This will sweep her right off her feet.
It's elegant, and she can
build on it for anniversaries.
Lucky grandma.
You dog. You're gonna ask
Susan to marry you, aren't you?
I didn't say that.
Man, I'm cool.
As far as I'm concerned,
Susan's old news, so...
Mazel tov.
I don't suppose there's any hope
of you keeping your mouth
shut about this, is there?
I wanted to surprise her.
Oh, trust me, brother. She'll be surprised,
and not just by how small that rock is.
Look, I-I know it's an expensive car,
but I need one, so can I get the money?
You're a lousy liar, kid.
I read the papers.
I know what happened to your father.
My guess is he's in the market for a fancy
lawyer to get him some rich man's justice.
Please.
Paul Young put Deirdre in a box.
My daughter. Your mother.
So we're clear,
I don't write checks to monsters.
Why can't you just give me the money?
You're dying. You don't need it. I do.
Don't cry, Zach. It pisses me off.
Well, you said all of
this was gonna be mine,
so when do I get it?!
"Empire" is a highfalutin word,
but that's what I've built.
Unfortunately...
an empire can only be ruled by
an iron fist and a strong gut.
I wanted to give it to you, Zach,
But I'm starting to
have my doubts about you.
So what?
Are you cutting me off?
I don't have any use for weakness.
Get out.
What, are you gonna kill me?
Prove you're a tough guy?
See? That's why I can't give you
the keys to the kingdom, kid.
No balls.
We met Gabrielle Solis the
day she moved to Wisteria Lane.
We were all excited to get a glimpse
of a successful New York model.
Hello?
We saw more...
Hi there.
...than we bargained for.
I'm Mary Alice.
Hi.
This is Susan, uh, Lynette and Bree.
Welcome to the neighborhood.
Well, I am Gabrielle Solis.
Would it be better if we
came back at another time?
Oh! No, no. I was...
just changing out of my sweaty clothes.
I didn't realize moving
was such great cardio.
Hey, babe, we haven't
tried it in the kitchen yet.
Honey, uh, I think it's
time to unpack the pants.
Right.
It's nice to meet you, ladies.
Let me guess newlyweds?
Four months,
and I've dressed like
this for two of 'em.
He's insatiable.
Hey, what are you doing?
Tryin' to have sex with you.
Now? Babe, it's kind of late.
You don't wanna have sex with me?
You always wanna have sex with me.
You wanted to have sex with me
an hour after your hernia operation.
I'm a little preoccupied.
A good man died today.
Don't take it personally.
Xiao-Mei said the
strangest thing to me.
When I told her you were dead,
she said, "Please don't kill him. "
That poor kid.
We really need to get
her some English lessons.
Julie, what are you doing?
I'm trying to sleep.
Morning, ladies.
Karl! What are you doing?
I've got a little surprise
planned for my girls.
So just sit back and relax.
We'll be there shortly.
No, no, no, no.
No, turn my house around.
Latte?
Out to the right, ladies.
My gift to you.
You bought us a house?
Let's have a look around.
There's three bedrooms,
a gourmet kitchen...
for what it's worth.
There's a guest house in the back
that you could use as a studio.
There's a pool.
A pool? Really? Aah!
What's the catch?
There's no catch. It's yours, Susie.
Yours and Julie's, no strings attached.
I can't accept this.
I just... I gotta get out
of this mess on my own.
This is not charity.
I owe you...
for everything I've done over the years,
for all the heartache
I've inflicted on you.
Consider it payback.
Mom!
There's a pool and a jacuzzi!
At least no one can drive off with it
while you're sleeping, huh?
Hey, it's Susan.
Just wanted you to know I let
the electrician in your house.
I hope you're having
a great time at the spa.
Bree, hi. It's Betty.
I'm... I'm sorry to
leave this on the machine,
but the police have evidence that implicates
Matthew in the murder of Melanie Foster.
We have to find them, Bree.
We have to find them
and get Danielle back.
You let go of me right now!
Hey, hey!
What's going on here?
I am trying to leave, and these morons won't let me.
Do you know that you can
be arrested for kidnapping,
for detaining someone?!
Why do you need to leave?
Because my daughter is in danger.
Something happened at cheerleading camp?
Okay, there's no camp.
That was a fib on my part.
I found out that she
ran away with a boy,
and the boy is a murderer.
A murderer?
I can tell by your tone
that you don't believe me.
Bree, let's talk about
this in my office.
I don't have time for
therapy, you quack!
Now let me out of here! Let go of me!
You idiot, let go of me!
You know that I committed
myself voluntarily!
You can't do this to me! No!
Bree, please, don't struggle.
If anything happens to my daughter,
so help me God...
We're only trying to help.
Mr. Young, you'll need to come up to
the house to sign some legal documents.
What for?
Noah Taylor's will called
for an immediate transference
of his entire estate
to you upon his death.
So everything's mine?
That's correct.
Hi, Dad.
So, did you have any luck
with your grandfather?
Yeah, I talked to Noah.
He's not gonna give us the money.
Damn it, Zach!
Sorry?
Go back and talk to him.
No, I-I don't think he's
gonna change his mind.
Terrific. Am I gonna see you tomorrow?
No, I-I can't come tomorrow.
What about Monday?
Uh, next week's bad for me, too.
I'll... I'll call you when I know.
Zach? Zach!
Is there anything I can do?
Yeah, get me a new phone
with a different number.
And fill in this stupid lake.
Careful with those.
The last of the crystal.
Hey, what's going on?
Oh, hi. Um, we're just moving.
Hey! It's the plumber.
You come over to help Susie
move into her new house?
New house?
Oh, she didn't tell you?
I bought a place for my girls.
You let him buy you a house?
Uh, well, he's not moving in with us.
After that speech about
wanting to go it alone,
and after I offered to
let you stay with me?
To be fair, you just had a spare room,
and this is a whole house.
Hey, no offense, if you're not using
your back, you're just in the way.
You saw me buying that ring,
and you just had to cut me off.
You bought me a ring?
Suze, let me handle this.
A man's gotta protect his family.
Uh, Mike, about that ring...
Put that box down.
What, you gonna hit me, huh?
Stop it! Oh, my...
What are you just stop it!
Oh, that's enough!
Just get off! Get off!
Go! Go! Oh, my God.
What? Stop! That's enough.
Enough, enough. Back up.
And that ring, that was for me, right?
Not now.
Oh, my...
Ohh!
Karl, are you okay?
Are you okay? Let me see.
Oh, my God.
Can you sit up?
Xiao-Mei, do you have a second?
This is probably silly,
but it's been bothering me.
When you said, "Please don't kill him,"
did you mean Carlos?
Ralph dead, not Mr. Solis.
I know. It's just,
you said "kill," not "dead. "
And I'd have to do be
pretty angry to kill someone,
so I guess my question is,
do I have a reason to
be angry at Mr. Solis?
Please, so much laundry.
Xiao-Mei...
how did you rip your panties?
I fall down.
Says here Dr. Bader
examined Xiao-Mei last week,
and everything was fine.
Yeah, I know.
It's just, she's been
having pain... down there.
So if you could take a peek,
it'd make me feel so much better.
Of course.
Um, and, Doctor, uh,
while you're down there,
could you check if she's still a virgin?
I'm sorry?
You don't even have to say it out loud.
If you see hymen,
just give me a thumbs up.
What's this now?
I wanna swim.
Well, we already swam.
Now it's time to pack.
Hey, hey, hey! What's going on?
Dad would let me swim.
Well, Dad's not here,
so I decide, and I decide "no".
Oh, Porter, what are you doing?
Hey!
Hey, get down off that
right now. I mean it!
Okay! Okay, okay, Porter,
just stop, all right?
Just come on inside, and
we'll forget the whole thing.
Daddy!
Daddy! Daddy!
Hey, guys. God! Ooh, God,
I've missed you so much.
Oh, you, too, munchkin.
Where's Porter? Is he okay?
He broke his arm.
They took him up to X-ray.
Hey, guys, why don't you look
after your sister for me, okay?
Mommy and Daddy need to talk.
I've got nothing to say to you.
I just called because I had to.
Honey, whatever you
saw, I can explain it.
I am not interested,
and if you wanna keep those fingers,
I would move 'em away
from my body. Thank you.
Lynette, I am not cheating on you.
I never have, and I never will.
I saw you with that woman.
Her name is Nora. I met her 12 years ago.
I don't care what her name is.
I met her before you. She
was a dancer on a cruise ship.
We had a one night stand.
I haven't thought about her in years.
Then why are you going to Atlantic City
every other weekend to visit her?
I have another child, Lynette.
What?
She got pregnant from
the one night stand.
Nora raised the kid
without ever telling me.
I only just found out about it. That
is why I have been going back and forth.
I am not having an affair.
Uhh!
The little girl's name is Kayla.
She's 11 years old.
I know I should've told
you about this sooner.
It's just that I wanted to take
a paternity test to be sure,
and I'm definitely the dad.
Why did she wait so long to contact you?
She said she wanted
to raise the kid alone,
and I... I guess she's
changed her mind, honey.
Baby, I am so sorry.
Not ready for that yet.
Okay.
You have no idea how
badly you scared me.
I am so sorry.
I had already let you go.
Dad! I got a blue cast.
Hey, buddy. You sure did.
That's pretty cool.
Hey.
It itches. Can we go home now?
Yeah. We're going home.
Have they rung up your prescription yet?
No, they're getting it right now.
Good. Add that on.
You're dying your
hair honey wheat blond?
Oh, it's not for me.
It's for Danielle.
That hair is going back
to the color God intended.
You actually think she's gonna sit still
as you towel this through her hair?
Oh, I will tie her down if necessary.
I'm also thinking of checking
her body for piercings
while I'm at it.
You're overreacting.
She's just going through a phase.
That's what girls her age do.
They also get pregnant
and become drug addicts.
And that color hair is the gateway.
Would you please, uh,
add that to our bill?
I'm telling you, Bree,
you're gonna have to
stop riding 'em so hard.
I am trying to ensure that they
turn into responsible adults.
Trust me, Rex, in the end,
we will be rewarded.
How can you be so damn sure
of yourself all the time?
Why is my certainty a flaw?
I know what I'm about, I know my values,
and I know what's right.
Why shouldn't I stay the course?
Am I right, Mr. Williams?
My mother always took a firm hand
with me, and I thank her for it.
Exactly, and look how
well you turned out.
Look, you're a good mother,
but there's a limit.
You have got to relinquish some control,
or else you're gonna regret it.
Excuse me. Do you have the time?
Yeah, it's just after 8:00.
Oh, I was afraid of that.
Afraid of what?
Well, I'm only supposed to
be restrained until 7:00.
You see, I have a
problem with sleepwalking.
They just tie me up so that I
don't wander off and hurt myself.
Yeah, well, I'm sure a
nurse will be in here soon.
One can only hope.
Of course, if a doctor gets here first
and sees that someone
forgot to release me,
I'm sure they'd get in a lot of trouble.
Lady, I can't let you out of
your restraints. I'd get fired.
Oh. Well, I certainly would
not want that to happen.
What's your name?
Alfred.
Oh! Does anybody ever call you "Alfie"?
No.
And why should they?
So, um, Alfred,
I was wondering if you could
maybe loosen my restraints.
They're incredibly tight,
and I'm sure there are no rules
against making me more comfortable.
Do you think I'm stupid?
I beg your pardon?
Two seconds after I loosen
these little restraints,
you'll try to scratch my eyes out
and make a run for it.
Well, I'm not falling for it,
you psycho little bitch.
In fact, I hope they keep you
tied up for the next month,
'cause I'd get a real kick out of watching a prissy
little whack job like you lying in your own filth.
Know what I mean?
Oh. Are you all right?
Uh, yeah. A little hopped up
on pain medicine, but, um,
I chipped my tooth on the salad shooter.
Oh. Oh, you know, you should, um,
call my friend Orson.
He's a dentist.
I'm sure he'll see you right away.
Thanks.
So...
about that ring you bought...
Is there anything particular
you'd like to ask me?
Nope, not as long Karl's got you
wrapped around his finger.
Okay, that's ridiculous.
Karl doesn't have me
wrapped around anything.
You accepted a house from him,
and you're nuts if you believe
he doesn't have an ulterior motive.
He's Karl. He's playing me.
But that house is gonna be a great
place for my daughter to live.
And when he makes his move,
he's gonna realize that
I was really playing him.
So... about that ring...
I... I just don't want
to get deeper into this
and suddenly realize your
heart's somewhere else.
Mike, my heart is in
the exact right place.
I can't have this conversation.
Now my tooth is throbbing.
Of course.
Okay.
You don't even wanna know
what my answer would have been?
Can we please get out of here?
This place is gross.
And, God, I'm starving.
Yeah, I know, but we don't
have any money, remember?
That's why we should go to my house.
I know the combination to my Mom's safe.
Okay, I've told you a thousand times,
it's way too risky. No.
Something you should know before we embark
on this little adventure...
I can get pretty
bitchy when I'm not fed.
Listen, I hope I'm not out of line here,
but did you ever spend
any time in prison?
What, you can tell from my teeth?
Jailhouse dentistry.
Unmistakable and not pretty.
Yeah, I did a little time
in Kansas a few years back.
Were you a prison dentist?
Uh, during dental school,
we did freebie work
on some of the poor guinea
pigs behind bars. No offense.
You know, I had the
feeling when I first saw you
in the movie theater that we'd met before.
I don't think so.
Oh, I'm pretty sure. I think I know you.
Any chance I was one
of your guinea pigs?
No. The only prison work
I did was back in Virginia.
Diploma says you
graduated from Minnesota.
I'm licensed in three states.
Open wide, please.
Don't talk. I wouldn't want to hurt you.
Carlos, you promised
you'd come home today.
Well, I don't care what Tanaka wants!
Rattling around this stupid house all
by myself is not what I signed up for!
No, no, no, don't hang up on me.
I'm not done yelling at you!
Mrs. Solis.
How are you?
The best you've ever had.
What's so funny?
Me and my friend Justin had this bet.
See who could lose their virginity
first this summer at bible camp.
Guess I beat him to the punch.
You were a virgin?
So it didn't show?
Uh, no.
No, I mean, I guess it
was, well, weird when
you started naming the
American presidents in order.
Ah, I wish you hadn't heard that.
I was just trying to...
No, no, you were good.
Just, if it comes up in school,
Paul Revere was never president.
Oh. Thanks.
I, uh, had a really
awesome time, Mrs. Solis.
Well, good. I'm glad,
because this can never happen again.
Why?
The only reason I did this
was because I was angry at Carlos.
Now, thanks to you,
I'm not angry anymore.
Well, you should be.
I mean, the guy's never around.
Hell, he's probably off having
his own affair right now.
Oh. I seriously doubt that.
How do you know?
Because Carlos doesn't have
an adulterous bone in his body.
What we just did he could never do.
For him, sex isn't just sex.
It's a sign of intimacy.
It's the way he shows love.
You know, instead of talking and
listening and spending time with me.
What was that for?
Thought you needed a kiss.
Well, since this is our last time,
I guess we can make the most of it.
So... you really trust him, huh?
Completely.
Like all good mothers,
Gabrielle had purchased several
top-of-the-line baby monitors.
She had planned to use them to keep
a close watch on her newborn child.
That plan was about to change.
So I'm gonna go shopping
and then I'm gonna see my trainer,
and I'll definitely be
gone for, like, three hours.
Okay. Well, I gotta go. Have fun.
Not later, Penny.
Mommy's gotta change
you now 'cause you stink.
Here, taste this.
Oh, man!
Xiao-Mei, that is amazing.
You like?
Oh, yeah. Sorry if I'm making a mess.
It's okay. Mu shu pork
supposed to be messy.
I wish Gabrielle could cook like this.
Have you ever tried her enchiladas?
One time. They make me sick.
Mike still hasn't seen the invitation.
He will, and he'll meet you
for a romantic motor home rendezvous,
and you'll propose, he'll accept,
and you'll both live happily ever after.
You really think that's
what's gonna happen?
It's my deepest hope.
Oh, there he is.
We're in.
Polly? That's a good name.
No way.
Pamela.
I said I wanted Penny.
Oh, Lynette...
Eight hours of grueling labor.
That's not fair.
Neither are stretch marks,
but what are you gonna do?
I've only known one
Penny in my whole life,
and she was a slut.
Isn't your aunt named Penny?
Yeah, that's her.
Our daughter is officially named.
You may go now.
All right, I'll let you win this one,
but I get to name the next one.
You promised me we'd stop at four.
Remember? You wanted four kids,
I wanted one, and somehow
we compromised on four.
Can we please stop now?
Lynette, you're hurting me.
I will stop as soon as you promise.
Okay, I promise.
Okay.
Honey, I... I didn't mean to upset ya.
It's just...
We've been so happy.
Sweetie, sometimes when you're at work,
and I'm home alone
with three young boys,
I'm not so happy.
And now I'm gonna be
alone with four kids.
Each one is a blessing, yes,
but I don't think I can
take any more... blessings.
More blessings could
make me lose my mind.
Do you understand?
Yeah.
Thank you.
Honey, that really hurt.
Did it hurt for eight hours?
No.
Okay, then.
I must have been crazy,
agreeing to this.
Honey, you're gonna feel
differently once you meet Kayla.
She is a sweet, smart little girl,
plus it'll help you get
past your resentment of Nora.
I don't...
Well, here goes.
Hey, you!
You must be Lynette.
And you must be Nora.
I guess it'd be weird if we hugged.
Probably.
Wh-where's Kayla?
Oh, she didn't come.
We got into this huge fight,
and I was, like...
I just couldn't stand
to look at her face
on that long plane trip, so I
dumped her at the neighbor's.
But, hey, come on, you got me.
So, anyway, Kayla is doing great.
She's so pretty. She's so smart.
She's practically a
star on her soccer team.
I have the cutest picture.
You know, we wouldn't need a picture
if you had actually brought
her like you promised.
Oh, gosh, I'm sorry.
You know, but I just
haven't had much time
to get away on my own since,
um, I've been taking care
of your kid for the
past 11 years, Superdad!
Okay, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.
I know it's been hard.
You've done an amazing job.
Thank you. I think, so, too.
Apology accepted.
Anyway, I wasn't sure
that I wanted Kayla here
if we were gonna talk about business.
Business?
I was hoping that we could
talk about child support
since I've got, like, eleven
years coming to me, right?
You never told me I had a daughter.
My lawyer thinks that
I have a very good case.
We can't afford this. We have four kids.
Tom just lost his job.
That'd bankrupt us.
I'm the bad guy now when he's the one
that knocked me up and
abandoned his child?
How could he abandon her if he
didn't even know she existed?
That doesn't let him off the hook.
You know, you better do
right by me unless, of course,
you wanna be known as Mrs. Deadbeat Dad!
Just take it easy.
Are we just gonna keep talking louder?
Is that the plan?
You wanna just keep raising your voice
'cause that's how you
get what you want, right?
You make a scene, you throw a tantrum,
and everyone gets scared and backs off.
Well, I don't work that way, lady.
I don't care that my husband
was so phenomenally stupid
and/or drunk to actually
have sex with you.
I'm not gonna let it ruin my life.
Am I talking loud enough
for that to get through to you?
I'm just gonna pay the bill.
Karl, we've been through a lot together.
We will always be connected by Julie,
but... I know why you
bought me that house,
and I'm not moving into it.
Susie, come on, I-
Karl, we are not getting back together.
Not ever. You need to just
stop and realize that it's over.
I'm gonna marry Mike.
So I need you to sign these
because I have to be divorced first.
Mike popped the question.
No. He was going to, but then
you clocked him in the mouth
with a salad shooter, remember?
Actually, I'm going to pop the
question to him tomorrow night.
Guess it cuts down on the suspense
knowing he bought you a ring.
You would think so, but... no, it doesn't.
This is a lot to ask for a
man who still loves you, Susie.
I know.
But if you really do love me,
you'll let me go.
Okay, Susie. I can do that.
Well, you know where to find
me if it doesn't work out.
Oh, shut up.
I don't see another
way to make this work.
We've gotta dip into the pensions.
Oh, I don't like the sound of that.
Well, it's that or
the kids' college fund.
We'll write Nora one big check,
and in return, she'll sign away her
claim for the back child support.
If we're lucky,
she'll take the bird in the hand.
Okay, what are we
talking about? How much?
Well, we need to show her we're serious.
$30,000?
Are you kidding? Thirty?
If she takes you to court,
we'll lose and end up paying
11 years of child support all at once.
We could lose the house.
Oh, we are screwed. We are just plain screwed.
Tom!
I am trying very hard
to be strong right now,
and you melting down is not helping me.
I'm sorry.
I know we're using up a
huge chunk of our savings,
but if it keeps that crazy
woman out of our life,
it is the best money we have ever spent.
We will be okay.
Hey there.
I was surprised to hear
you wanted a session.
Well, there's nothing like being
tied to a bed to change a girl's mind.
What do you wanna talk about?
Anything at all.
As you said, I...
I have a lot of issues.
Well, I assumed as much
when you told the ridiculous story
about your daughter
running off with a murderer.
Saw right through that, did ya?
Well, I'm a trained professional, Bree.
The human mind is my playground.
Well, I'm glad that you're having fun.
I'm sorry. I don't mean to be flip.
But you came here
because you were troubled,
and then you refuse
any help we give you.
Things were falling apart
at home, and I just...
I just needed a place
to rest, that's all.
I think there's more to it than that.
Do you?
I think it has to do with your kids.
You don't want to talk about them.
Why is that?
Probably because I'm ashamed.
Ashamed?
My children were my life.
They were the reason that
I got up in the morning,
so to have failed them as a parent-
You think you failed them as a parent?
Well, my son is a sociopath,
and my daughter hates me enough
to have run away from home.
I'm certainly not gonna get
"Mother of the Year" anytime soon.
If your kids were here right now,
what would you tell them?
I would beg my son Andrew for
forgiveness for having given up on him,
and I would tell my
daughter not to worry,
that I have a plan to protect her.
And just what is that plan?
I've got everything ready to go.
Flowers, candles,
Elvis Costello CD all cued up.
But who has the ring?
He does.
So, wait, you're gonna
get down on one knee,
pop the question,
and while you're down there,
dig in his pocket?
What if you pull out his key chain?
Then I'm gonna have to find a
way to force it on my finger.
Oh, Xiao-Mei, where'd you
learn to kiss like that?
Sorry, that's Penny's baby monitor.
It's always picking up weird frequencies.
No, no, no! Don't turn it off.
Ohh! Move over.
My knees hit the dashboard.
I move seat back. Better?
Oh, yeah.
Are you done with my husband?
Good.
I have a little project for you.
Okay, Gaby, can we
please talk about this?!
You're the one that gave
me permission, remember?
You said, "Go have sex with somebody"!
To have meaningless sex, Carlos,
not to sleep with the woman
who's carrying our child!
What is the matter?!
Look, we're even!
You had an affair, and I had an affair!
I had a reason to. You were never here!
I've been here, Carlos.
I have tried so hard to not be selfish
and to put your needs above mine.
I mean, for God's sakes, look at me!
I have agreed to be a mother for you!
Look, Gaby, you have every
right to be mad at me.
So I'm gonna go and
check into a hotel room
and let you cool down, but
we are going to work this out.
Forget the hotel, Carlos. Get a lease.
I can go now, too?
No, you can start dinner.
What?!
You're not going anywhere,
not as long as you have
my baby in your belly.
I don't know what that meant,
but I didn't like the tone.
So just remember I am the boss of you,
or else I'm gonna make this
the worst nine months of your life.
Hi.
Hi.
Did you get the check?
Yeah, I wanted to
talk to you about that.
Do you have a minute?
Tom?!
I'm not the type of person that
can keep things bottled up inside.
Really?
So I'm just gonna have to get this off my chest.
You made me feel really bad about
myself yesterday at the restaurant.
My sincerest apologies.
You treated me like
some sort of mercenary,
like the only reason I came here
was to extort money from you.
Well, to be honest,
first, we bought you pie,
then you tried to extort money from us.
See? There it is again, Lynette.
That mean streak.
All I want is what's best
for my child, for Tom's child.
As the mother of 80% of Tom's children,
I don't think it's
in their best interest
for you to drive us into bankruptcy.
Of course it isn't.
Here.
I signed the waiver that the
lawyer sent over with the check.
And I'm not even asking
for any back child support.
That's... that's...
that's great. Thank you.
See, Lynette? See?
It's not all about money.
It's not even a little bit
about money. It's about family.
'Cause we're all a big family now.
Sort of.
Which is why I took all the money
that you gave me, and I put it all down
on the sweetest little 2-bedroom
house over on Arden Drive.
Ar-Arden Drive over...
over by the mall?
Like, five minutes
from here Arden Drive?
It's perfect. I could
drop Kayla off here anytime
so she can play with her new siblings.
She can spend time with her Dad.
Well, to be clear, how
are you going to live?
How are you going to pay the mortgage?
You don't have a job here.
What is your problem with me, lady?!
I don't understand! You don't know me.
You don't know what I can do.
And yet you just always, just...
just... just...
Always on the attack. It's ugly,
and you should work on that.
Here's what I think.
I think that we should all work on this,
because I don't want every
Christmas to turn ugly
just because you and I don't get along.
Yeah, that would be a shame.
See, I told you she wasn't home.
Her car's not even here.
And you said the safe was upstairs?
Damn it, my mother must
have changed the combination.
Okay. Wait here. I'll be right back.
You did it.
You killed Melanie.
You put your jacket on her body.
I saw it, Matthew.
The police showed me the pictures.
Now you weren't there.
You don't know what happened.
Oh, God.
Caleb hurt her,
and Melanie threatened to bring
us all down because of that.
So your solution was to
make your brother think
he murdered a girl and
to make me think it?
What other choice did I have?
I knew that you wouldn't
hand Caleb over to the police.
I knew that you would protect him.
I would have protected you.
Well, I really couldn't count on that.
Matthew...
You don't love me as much as you love Caleb.
You never have.
Perhaps.
But it's because he's needed me more.
You are always going to
find love in the world.
Don't you understand?
He was only ever going
to get it from me.
You know, I know you believe that.
That's why I've tried
so hard to forgive you.
And who knows?
Maybe one day I will.
9-1-1. What is
your emergency?
I need the police.
See, I told you she had cash.
Danielle, I don't know
what you're planning,
but I need to talk to you right now.
Give it up, Mom. We're leaving.
I'm calling the police.
Do you remember that
girl, Melanie Foster?
Matthew is the one who killed her.
I know you don't want us to be together,
but that's the lamest
thing I've ever heard.
His mother told me what
happened. It's true.
Let's go, Danielle.
Mom, please move.
No. I gave up on your brother,
and I'm not gonna make
that mistake with you.
We don't have time for this.
Where did you get that?
What are you doing?!
Move away!
Danielle...
I want you to get out of the house now.
He's a killer.
Shut up!
Don't point that at my mother!
Danielle!
I'm serious. Go.
What's wrong with you?!
I'm gonna shoot you!
Matthew, stop it!
If that's what it takes...
to get my daughter...
Stop it!
... to see who you really are...
Stop pointing that at my mother!
... then fine.
What are you doing?!
Do it.
Stop!
It's okay, baby.
Hey, it's just me again. Um...
When you got the invitation,
I thought that you
gave me the thumbs up,
but I guess if that was actually...
some other type of finger gesture, uh...
well, I apologize for leaving you all
these messages and wasting your time.
This is the street
where I used to live...
and these were the people
with whom I shared my life.
I met them the day they moved in.
And I saw what they brought with them.
Beautiful dreams for the future.
And quiet hopes for a better life...
not just for themselves,
but for their children, too.
If I could, would I tell
them what lies ahead?
Would I warn them of the sorrow
and betrayal that lie in store?
No. From where I stand now,
I see enough of the road to
understand how it must be traveled.
The trick is to keep moving forward,
to let go of the fear and
the regret that slow us down
and keep us from enjoying a
journey that will be over too soon.
Yes, there will be
unexpected bends in the road,
shocking surprises we didn't see coming,
but that's really the point...
don't ya think?
Orson.
Oh, hey.
I wanted to come by and
see how you were doing
after your great escape,
and, uh, these are for you.
How sweet and... unexpected.
Do you wanna come in?
I'd love to.
