Season 4 Episode 01
Now You Know
The first thing you should know
is that Edie Britt never
actually intended to die,
but someone she loved
was trying to leave her.
So she planned every detail,
from the silk scarf she'd hang by
to the suicide note detailing
her despair.
Now all Edie had to do.
was wait.
For her beloved to come home.
Hey, Edie!
I'm here to get my stuff.
You see, to hold on to her man,
Edie knew she'd have
to find the perfect
moment to let go.
Hey, Carlos!
Sadly for Edie.
Can I talk to you?
Her timing was fatally flawed.
Mrs. McCluskey?
I need to show you something.
Come here.
What's this?
Those are trash cans.
I know they're trash cans, smart-ass.
I'm asking what they're doing out
on a saturday night
when the trash got picked up
on thursday.
Fine. I will take them in.
Happy now?
Carlos.
what the hell is that?
And this is how Carlos Solis
arrived just in the nick of time
to save the life of Edie Britt.
Baby. What did you do?
Come on, you gotta wake up.
Come on, please?
Of course, had he known what
she was about to do to his life.
he would've let her hang there.

Synchro: YST & YDY
There is a certain time of night,
after children have been put to bed
and husbands have begun snoring,
that women lie awake and
think of the secrets
they've been keeping
from their friends.
It might be an impromptu wedding.
or a recently diagnosed tumor.
or a make-believe pregnancy.
Regardless,
it's all they will think of.
until something comes
along to remind them
that other people have secrets, too.
Carlos.
How is she?
What did the doctors say?
They've got Edie on a ventilator,
but she's gonna be okay.
What the hell happened?
How could she pull a stunt like this?
She left a note which
pretty much blames me.
Sweetie.
I can't believe this is happening.
It's like mary alice all over again.
Yes, but the good news
is she's gonna live.
I know it's her wedding night, but
do you think we should call Gaby?
Crap.
Gaby?
You know, this better be one hell
of a wedding night,
considering how long
you're taking in there.
Trust me, Victor.
This will be a night
you'll never forget.
 Let's get out of here.
What?
I'm serious.
You, me just screw it all.
Let's run away together.
I just got married.
There are 200 people out there
waiting for me to lead a conga line.
You just said you don't feel
like Victor really loves you,
and you know I do. I've never stopped.
I can't dump him on our wedding day.
That's a horrible thing to do,
even to Victor.
He'll get over it, but I've never
gotten over losing you,
and I won't let it happen again!
Gaby, you in here?
I was just counting gifts.
That's fine. I was actually
looking for that publicist guy.
You haven't seen him, have you?
I'll give you a holler
when I need you.
Come on!
Who doesn't wear underwear
on their wedding day?
Focus, you idiot! Come on.
When are we leaving?
so we're doing this?
Great. It'll take me a few hours
to get stuff together.
I'm gonna pick you up tonight.
Just be packed and ready to go.
Wait!
Aren't you gonna kiss the bride?
Finally!
Carlos, where the hell are you?
I'm at the hospital.
Edie tried to kill herself tonight.
My God! Is she okay?
I found her just in time, but obviously,
I can't come pick you up tonight.
Okay, that's all right.
I'll just take a cab and meet you.
Gaby, I can't leave Edie now.
Look, maybe in a couple weeks.
In a few weeks? What?
No! It has to be tonight!
Victor's in the bedroom right
now waiting to consummate.
And Edie's on a ventilator.
Look, you don't have to stay
with Victor. You have a house.
Okay, you know, running away with you
on my wedding night was crazy enough.
But running away to be alone is insane!
Gaby, please,
she needs me. Can't you just wait?
No! I would rather try and
work it out with Victor.
Gaby, are you coming to bed?
One month later.
Happy 1 month anniversary.
I didn't know we were doing this.
We've just been so happy
the last four weeks,
I thought we should celebrate.
you are happy, right?
I've never been happier.
That's sweet.
I don't believe you.
I watch you sometimes,
and you seem very.
disconnected,
like something's missing.
Nothing is missing.
So our life together is exactly
how you pictured it?
You've gotten everything you wanted?
Pretty much.
"Pretty much" means there is something
that you want that you don't have.
How can I give it to you if
you don't tell me what it is?
Susan, I swear, I am ecstatically,
beyond my wildest dreams,
lip-smackingly happy.
You got it?
This marriage is doomed.
A moving van just pulled up.
Andrew,I'm having problems
with my strap. Could you help me?
Look, I told you three weeks ago
I was no longer participating
in your little hoax,
and that includes strapping you in.
For heaven's sakes. Orson,
could you come help me, please?
I'll remember this the next time
you want money for leather pants.
People are gonna find out, all right?
And then we're gonna
all look like idiots.
Well, not if we're careful.
This isn't the 50's, okay? Teenage
girls get pregnant all the time.
I mean, my ex-lab partner's practically
a grandmother.
Look, this family's reputation
is already hanging by a thread.
I mean, first people thought that your
stepfather was a wife killer,
then your sister takes up
with her history teacher,
and now we're supposed to parade
a little bastard up and down the street.
We might as well sit on the porch
and play banjos.
You know, there's a moving van
next door.
Mom, are you awake?
Okay, honey. Just give me a minute.
Give me a minute.
My wig is gone. Where is it?
It's on the nightstand.
No,I'm looking at the nightstand,
and all I see are a few stray hairs
and this sports blooper dvd
you thought would cheer me up.
Peyton Manning is funny.
Mom!
Hey,I'm coming!
Don't just sit there like a lump!
Come on! Help me look!
God. Honey,
this is one of those moments when
it occurs to me that
wouldn't it be easier
if we just told everyone
that you have cancer?
I found it.
Look, I mean,
I get not wanting to scare the kids,
but to keep all of our friends
in the dark.
look, I can deal with the chemo.
I can deal with people telling me
my hair has never looked better.
But what I cannot deal with is
the pity, so we are doing it my way.
You were crooked.
hey, sweetie, what's up?
There's a moving van
across the street.
So you want it listed right away?
And don't worry about
getting top dollar.
I want this place priced to move.
What's going on here?
I'm meeting with our realtor.
Gaby, you remember Gil.
I remember telling you I wasn't
ready to sell the house yet.
Gil, could you give us
a minute, please?
Gaby, we agreed that after we got
married, you would sell the house.
I still have a lot of stuff here.
Well, my house is over
10,000 square feet.
I'm pretty sure there are closets.
I'm just not in a rush to unload
this house, okay?
This was my home.
I was very happy here.
But we've got a new home now.
Aren't you happy there?
Yeah, it's a great house.
Well, good. Then sell this place.
What are you waiting for?
I'm not waiting for anything.
Look, a moving van.
New neighbors. What do we know?
Well, dining chairs. There's a clue.
Yes. It proves they eat sitting down.
No, I mean they're stickley.
It means they have taste.
And money.
They've been remodeling for weeks.
I wish Edie were here.
Without her, there's no one
to give us the dish.
Yet another illustration of the
fundamental selfishness of suicide.
Do you think this is them?
My God. Katherine.
Katherine!
Susan!
I cannot believe it has been 12 years.
You haven't changed a bit.
Well, you clearly have.
Your eyes sight's going.
How's your aunt?
Katherine used to live
here with mrs. Sims.
Not very well,I'm afraid.
That's really the reason
why we moved back.
I didn't want poor aunt lily to spend
her final days in a nursing home.
That is so kind of you.
Yeah, it is.
And as luck would have it,
my husband found a job here.
Adam, could you wave or something?
Hello, ladies.
I look forward to meeting you
when I'm a little less sweaty.
He's a cutie.
What does he do?
He's a doctor.
Don't take this personally,
but we hate you.
Mom?
I finished unpacking my room.
Do you need any help?
My God.
This is not little Dylan.
I'm Susan, Julie's mom.
She is gonna be so excited
to see you.
Great.
Who's Julie again?
Honey, you remember your best
friend when you were little.
Right.
Why don't you go help your stepfather
with the last few boxes?
It's nice meetg you all.
What a beautiful family.
I feel so lucky to have you
for a neighbor.
No, I am the lucky one.
Look at my view.
Your garden is absolutely breathtaking.
And that pine tree in the backyard.
it's my pride and joy.
It absolutely kills me to have
to ask you to cut it down.
Excuse me?
I'm sorry, but I'm not gonna
be able to grow my prize
winning vegetables with that
tree blocking all the sunlight.
Well, I'm sorry about your vegetables,
but that pine shields my view
of the purcells' backyard,
and if you had ever seen
mr. Purcell sunbathe,
you'd know exactly what
that tree means to me.
I don't want to quarrel.
We will not touch that tree
until we have come up with
a solution to our problem.
Curtains, perhaps.
So you're back. How fun.
I should have a brunch so that
everyone can get to know you.
No need. I'm having a barbecue
this saturday.
I'm inviting the whole neighborhood.
You don't need to do that.
I insist.
I have missed Wisteria lane so much,
and I wanna do something special
for my dear, old friends.
and all you lovely newcomers.
The nice thing about this fake
pregnancy is my feet don't swell.
I mean,I'd never be able to squeeze
into these sling-backs
if I really was 8/12 months pregnant.
Don't you look radiant!
Hello, mrs. McKeever.
I heard that you were expecting,
but I had no idea how far
along you were.
May I?
There's no need.
The baby's just not kicking
right now.
Sometimes, if you give them a little
jiggle, you can get them to move.
She doesn't really wanna
be jiggled right now.
She's very sensitive down there.
But I'll be gentle.
You know, in my day, mothers thought
that it was good luck.
Perhaps I need to make my point
a little more clearly.
Bree, you're hurting me!
Is there a problem here?
No, not at all!
I'm just saying hello to a very
dear friend of mine.
Are you gonna back off now?
Car's here, dear.
Lovely to see you, mrs. McKeever.
Why must old ladies always do that?
I don't know, but you've got to
stop roughing them up.
I'm sorry, Susan. Dr. Gorenberg just
had a patient go into labor.
His new partner is covering for him,
if you're comfortable with that.
Sure. I'm just here for a checkup.
Doctor?
Thank you.
I'm Dr. Mayfair.
I'm gonna...
Hold it. Have we met?
Yes. Yesterday.
Your new neighbor.
Right.
I didn't know you were,
this kind of doctor.
I sure am.
Listen...
Maybe this isn't-
Feet up, please.
And scootch down.
It's just that it's weird, you know,
considering you're.
where'd you go?
And relax.
Sorry.
And relax.
Sorry.
And relax.
Sorry.
Hey, not to change the subject,
but when is Dr. Gorenberg coming back?
Almost done.
you know, Katherine has talked
about you for years.
It's nice to finally put
a face to the name.
Muriel. How are you doing?
What's up? You look good.
Don't try to sweet-talk me,
Lynette Scavo. I am fit to be tied.
Did you or did you not
volunteer to run the fund-raising gala?
Yeah. Things have been
a little weird lately-
don't even think of wriggling
out of this, Lynette.
Every other third grade mom
has chaired an event.
It is your turn.
Okay. I'll jump right on it.
Great. Okay.
See. That's where
someone with half a brain would
have played the cancer card.
I can handle it.
Like hell.
You've been nauseous
all day from the chemo.
You shouldn't even be here!
It's my life.
Some stupid disease is not gonna
keep me from living it.
Besides, Parker's expecting to see me.
There. He saw you.
We'll duck out when
the lights go down.
He's gonna be watching for me
all day. He's one of the leads.
He's Friar Tuck.
It's a thankless role.
Well, everything seems normal.
But you say you've been having
irregular periods.
You know, one month off,
two months on. That happens, right?
Ever experience night sweats?
Sometimes. But Mike's a big spooner.
He's like sleeping with a hibachi.
How about hot flashes?
I'm gonna stop you right there.
I am way too young for that.
Please refer to your chart.
I know for a lot of women the word
"Menopause" has negative connotations.
They hear "aging",
"brittle bones",
"loss of sexual desire".
Okay, before we go any further,
can I check those diplomas?
'Cause I would just like
to make sure that
they're not from some med
school in the Philippines.
Look, there's a simple blood test
we can use to find out.
I don't need any test!
I am not old enough for menopause.
Now I don't know
what kind of nonsense
they taught you at
Harvard medical school,
class of
97?
My God! I am old!
Just give me the damn test.
We will live in these woods
till our work is done.
If the sheriff comes, we will drive him
away with our bows and arrows.
You okay?
I'm feeling a little.
God save all ye merry men!
I'm fine.
Pray that I may join your man-
band of merry men.
I am more than just a jolly Friar,
for I can have both
a sword and an arrow!
We must support Robin Hood.
oh,I'm gonna be sick!
Right there with you, lady.
All hail Robin Hood!
Okay, let's go.
No! It's too late!
Bravo!
I'm sorry. I'll get you a new purse.
Fine, but that wasn't my purse.
Hello. You have everything you need?
You just let me know.
Hi! Good to see you!
Oh, you look great!
Mrs. Mccluskey. Hello.
How are you? Do you remember me?
You're bess truman, right?
Of course I remember you.
If that's your way of checking if
my brain's gone all tapioca,I'm fine.
Sorry.
So I saw your kid and your
new husband. Nice catch.
Oh. Well, thank you.
I'm very eager for him to
experience life on Wisteria lane.
The times that Dylan and I spent
here were the happiest of our lives.
Yeah? Then why'd you
take off so suddenly?
You skipped town without
even saying good-Bye.
My, you do remember a lot, don't you?
Excuse me. Really must mingle.
I think these eggs are past their prime.
So you just shun them
and throw them away.
Well, yeah, since mayonnaise
left out in the sun can kill ya.
Everything okay? You
seem kinda moody today.
Yeah, get used to it.
Okay, did I do something
wrong? No. I'm sorry.
I'm just a little.
You know what? Forget it.
Let's eat.
Yoo-Hoo, Susan! We saved you a place!
Come on! We want you over here. Come on.
Oh, my God! Dylan!
Hi.
It's me. Julie.
Julie's the one we were talking about.
Hi, honey!
Hi!
She was your best friend.
Yeah, and I-I brought you a little
wcome back gift. Your favorite.
Oh, my goodness.
You remember how much
you used to love licorice?
I did?
Okay.
Come on. I've got some of the
old gang I want you to meet.
Have fun!
Menopause?
Aren't you a little young for that?
I know.
And you thought you married a vibrant woman
in her prime, and instead, you got a wife who's.
Dry and dusty.
Oh, honey.
No, it's-It's a
natural part of life.
Yeah, the part before death. Oh!
Look, I know that it's upsetting, but
it's really not that big a deal.
Yes, it is! What if you wanna have kids?
We agreed that we didn't.
No, you said you did.
I said I didn't, then
you changed your mind.
What if you change it back?
That's not gonna happen.
Listen, my last egg could be on its
way down the chute at this very moment.
If you wanna have kids, you
might wanna jump on it right now.
All righ this is all very romantic, but
let me be clear about this, okay?
I love you, and if kids don't
happen,I'm fine with that.
I don't want you to be fine.
I want you to be happy.
All right,I'm just trying to
find a nice way to shut you up, so.
Yep, we're doomed.
Hey. Hey, look who's back.
Oh, my gosh. She's out of the clinic.
Thanks, darling.
Hi!
Hi!
How are you?
Oh, careful-The
neck.  Oh, sorry.
Thank you all so much for the cards.
Sometimes it takes a near tragedy to
realize just how much you're loved.
So why don't you talk to your
friends, and I'll go unpack the car?
Oh, thanks, sweetheart.
I have to admit that I was.
A little concerned about how
you'd react when you saw me.
But this. Throwing me a party?
Well. We just all love ya.
And, Edie, you look great. Especially.
You know, given the circumstances.
You mean that I tried to hang myself.
It's okay.
The doctor encouraged
me to talk about it.
Surely not over food.
Well, Carlos and I talk
about it all the time.
You know, and this whole thing has
just brought us closer together.
We've actually talked about marriage.
Hello. I don't think we've met.
I'm Katherine Mayfair, your new neighbor.
Oh, Edie. It's a pleasure to meet you.
Welcome to my party.
So I hear congratulations are in order.
Edie just announced
you're getting married.
Best wishes!
We're not engaged.
That was just a kind of
a what if conversation.
Really? Because she thinks
you're getting married.
Everyone else thinks
you're getting married.
So, again, best wishes.
Gaby, the woman tried to kill
herself because I left her.
She's not real good with disappointment.
Neither am I!
You told me you wanna run away together, and
then I don't hear from you for a month!
That was only because I was
going through stuff with Edie,
But it doesn't mean that I wasn't
thinking about you constantly.
You were not.
Yes, I was.
Every second of every day.
Yeah, well,I.
Kind of thought about you, too.
I need to be with you, Gaby.
Yeah?
Prove it.
Can you get away tonight?
Oh, my God, are you serious?
Damn right I am.
I just have to be back by
midnight to give Edie her pills.
What?
If we're gonna have an
affair, we've gotta be discreet.
Affair?
I thought we were talking
about runng away together.
I can't do that.
Edie's too fragile right now.
That old battle-Ax is
gonna outlive us all!
Hey, don't talk about her like that.
Oh, far be it for me to speak ill
of the future mrs. Carlos solis.
We are not getting married!
Best wishes!
No. Absolutely not.
That's my final answer.
Well, talk to you later.
That was danielle.
Now she wants us to send
a dvd player for her room.
Well, that hardly seems extravagant.
You're missing the point! It's
a convent, not the four seasons.
You have mustard on your chin.
I mean, it's one thing to forgive bad
behavior. It's another thing to reward it.
There are consequences for her mistakes.
Bree! Oh, my God!
Are you all right?
Oh! No, no,I'm fine!I'm fine!
You're bleeding!
No, no,no!
It's just, uh-Oh, it's
a little barbecue sauce.
Where is Katherine's husband?
He's a doctor.
She's fine.
Adam! Adam!
Get over here right now!
Bree got stabbed in the belly!
Oh, my God, are you all
right? Let me take a look.
No, it's nothing!
Ah, uh,we were just teasing Ida.
It's something we do.
Yes.
Look, it's a. Trick
ba-Barbecue fork.
We got it at a magic shop.
Uh, see? Retractable!
Oh, my baby!
That's quite a trick.
Hey, let's go freak out mrs. Mccluskey.
He's such a scamp.
Psycho mom at 5:00.
You say the word, she gets
a face full of pig bones.
Aw, my hero.
I can handle her.
Lynette.
I just spoke with helen, and
imagine my surprise when she told me
That you'd not started on
the decorations for the gala.
I'm in charge of decorations?
Yes, which you would've known had
you bothered to pick up the packet.
I don't want to hear it.
Okay.
Piggyback, mommy.
I'm sorry, sweetie.
I'm just I'm just
too tired right now.
Here, honey,I'll get ya.
Yes!
Mommy has to conserve her
energy for more important things.
We are not throwing in the
towel over a minor mishap.
How many more mishaps are
we gonna get away with?
Yesterday, it was an old woman
in the macy's shoe department.
Today, a magic fork in the belly.
Pretty soon, this whole charade will
completely unravel, and we will be humiliated.
We're already in too deep.
We could go on a trip, tell people
you miscarried while we were away.
And then what would happen to the baby?
Well, danielle would keep it.
You think danielle
could raise this child?
Orson, you've seen her in action.
She's-She's shallow, and
she's-She's selfish!
She would ruin this child's life!
How can you say that?
Because I'm her mother.
And I know what I've created, and
that's the real humiliation.
Orson.
Is child deserves better.
And I know what to do now. Please.
Please let me try.
So.
Really, what you want is a second chance?
Well, would that be so horrible?
Well, then.
Let the charade continue.
So you're bailing on me now?
I know.
The timing is terrible.
Damn right!
It's three weeks before the gala.
I just didn't realize how tired
I would be when I took this on.
Oh, we're all tired, Lynette.
But some of us still manage
to honor our commitments.
Okay,I'm gonna be honest with you.
I haven't been feeling that great lately.
Oh, don't whine to me about your aches and pains.
I've had the sammigraine since '87.
And my knee's so bad, I can't
even use the treadmill anymore.
Yeah.
That's rough.
By the way.
I have cancer.
I'll give helen a call.
So I am halfway through chemo, and
my doctor is very confident
That I'm going to beat
this, so you can all relax.
I'm not going to die.
Well, not unless we kill you.
Damn it, Lynette. What did
we say after mary alice.
After Edie? Why didn't they tell us?
We're your friends. Why
would you shut us out?
I just liked being able to throw on my
wig and join you guys for a cup of coffee
And a good gossip
about the new neighbors.
You know, for five minutes, I could
pretend I wasn't a sick person.
But once your friends know you're
sick, you can't pretend anymore
'Cause you can see
it in their eyes-
The fear, the pity.
Is that all you see in our eyes?
No. No, of course not.
You know what? Let's make a pact.
No more secrets.
From now on, we tell each other
every shocking detail of our lives.
I'm in.
Me, too.
You with us?
Absolutely.
No more secrets.
You're right. I'm not happy. Let's talk.
All I'm saying is I just wanna
know that I come first with you.
Sometimes I feel less like
your wife than a possession.
It's demeaning.
It's-It's.
Why are you smiling right now?
Because this is fantastic.
After weeks of shutting me out, you're
finally telling me how you feel.
We should do this all the time.
Well, it's hard when you're so busy.
Maybe we should go away and just
take a couple weeksr a month.
Let's rediscover wt it was that
made us fall in love to begin with.
That is a great idea. Let's do it.
How's next week?
Let's see here.
Well,I've got the meeting with
the school board on tuesday.
And the end of the month,I've got that
conference in washington-Oh, shoot.
I've got the groundbreaking
for the new civic center.
Dad's birthday.
Economic development forum.
How about april?
I can give you two whole weeks in april.
I'll see you later, babe.
Where you going?
To Scavo's for a few beers.
Can I come?
No.
Why not?
Edie, I know you've been through a lot
lately, but I can't hold your hand 24 hours a day.
If you want this relationship to
work, you gotta give me some downtime.
Okay, so I managed to get away from Edie.
What do you want?
To get you away from Edie.
Oh, come on. You have to remember
your boyfriend joey miller.
You used to chase him
around the jungle gym.
Really?
You'd think I would've gone for this
guy with the sexy finger up his nose.
So you don't remember any of
the kids we used to play with?
No.
To be honest, I don't remember
anything about living here.
Really?
So. What is your earliest memory?
I don't know if this is a memory, but.
For years,I've had this creepy dream.
I'm really little,
And there's a guy in my
room, and he tries to grab me.
That is creepy.
Have-Have
you ever.
Talked to somebody about it?
You mean like a therapist?
My old babysitter suggested
that, but my mom got mad and said no.
Really?
Yeah.
Then she fired the babysitter.
Susan?
I'm in here.
Uh, your front door was open.
No problem.
Um, what's up?
First, let me just say this is one of the
more embarrassing moments of my career,
And you have every right to hate me.
Adam, I have no idea what
you're talking about.
Well, your test results came back, and
your estrogen levels are fine.
You're not about to start menopause.
Really? That's fantastic!
There's more.
More?
You're pregnant.
What? Wh-What did he just say?
I'm pregnant?
He said I'm pregnant.
I have never been happier.
Well, now I believe you.
There you are.
I'm sorry.
I got in late last night.
I didn't want to wake you.
You don't have to explain.
I trust you.
Well, good. Yoshould.
I just wish you trusted me a bit more.
What are you talking about?
Why didn't you ever tell me
about your offshore bank account?
What?
Well, you know, the one in the cayman
islands with $10 million in it.
I miss you when you're gone.
Going through your things makes
me feel like you're with me.
Okay, um,I know how this looks.
What did you think I was gonna do?
Tell people?
Turn you in? Try to get
my little hands on it?
I don't care about money, Carlos.
All I care about is you.
That's why this relationship
is going to work.
You can trust me with your secrets,
Just like I can trust
you not to hurt me.
There is a certain time of morning.
It occurs after kids
have left for school
And husbands have headed off for work.
It's a time when women think of the secrets
they've been keeping from their friends.
And how shocked they would be
if the truth was discovered.
And how they'll do everything in their
power to keep that from happening.
But what of those lucky women
who have no secrets left to keep?
What do they think about every morning?
Hey!
Is something wrong?
It's just.
Dylan and I used to be best friends.
I mean, we did everything together.
I know. She was like a sister to you.
Well.
That girl that I've
been hanging out with.
And I know this is
gonna sound crazy, but.
That's not the same girl.
These women spend their mornings
thinking of their neighbors
And the secrets. They may be keeping.
There you are. I've been calling you.
Is this the room?
Yes.
Dylan's been asking me
if she can move in here.
So let her.
You may remember what
happened here, but she can't.
Doesn't matter.
I won't allow it
Hey, you okay?
Did we make a mistak coming back here?
Did we have a choice?
Previously on "Desperate Housewives"
The new neighbor...
Oh, my god. Katherine.
Turned out to be
an old friend of Susan's...
and that pine tree in the back yard...
it's my pride and joy.
Who had a problem
making new friends.
Oh, it absolutely kills me to
have to ask you to cut it down.
Her daughter couldn't recall the past.
I'm Julie's mom.
Who's Julie again?
Your best friend
when you were little.
But her husband had news for susan.
You're pregnant.
Lynette revealed her condition.
I have cancer.
Gaby and carlos began a secret affair.
Can you get away tonight?
Are you serious?
And edie uncovered a secret
of another sort.
Why didn't you ever tell me
About your offshore
bank account...
the one with $10 million in it?
the great
crime wave hit wisteria lane
on a tuesday afternoon.
That's when residents found
their barbecues upended...
their clean laundry trampled...
and their skateboards missing.
Naturally,
everyone began to ask
who could be responsible
for such carnage.
The answer
lay in the home of a neighbor
who, 20 minutes earlier,
had been engaging in...
an altogether
different type of crime.
Oh, i gotta get back.
I told edie i was just
going for a jog.
Do i look sweaty enough
for a 5-mile run?
Yeah. Unfortunately,
it's my sweat.
Mmm. Mmm.
When are you gonna dump her?
it's complicated,
okay?
Besides, i don't see you
in any big hurry
to dump victor.
Generally speaking,
women don't leave their husbands
for guys who have girlfriends.
Just boot the bitch.
What are you afraid of?
Hey, i am not afraid of...
Oh, my god!
What the hell's
the matter with you?
edie!
gaby, you in there?
okay.
one second!
Edie! What brings you here?
I'm looking for carlos.
He went for a run,
but it was hours ago.
Sorry. Haven't seen him.
Really? Because ida greenberg
said that she thought
she saw him on your porch.
Uh, that's impossible, because
he's there! There he is!
What?
Carlos!
He's at your house.
Oh, he just let himself in. Oh.
There you go. He's home.
Okay. Well, thanks.
You told her
i was at home.
So?
So i'm not at home.
I'm here.
What the hell
am i supposed to do?
Edie! Edie, wait!
Wait, wait, wait!
Don't go!
Don't go!
Why?
Uh, you, uh,
have a birthday coming up,
and, uh, i don't know
what to get ya.
Or maybe a coffeepot
or scented hangers
or... a nice clock radio.
Gaby, i don't have time
for this.
Why don't you just
surprise me?
Uh, wait, but don't go!
I i need a little more guidance!
Damn it, boys! You should not be
screwing around in the streets!
Somebody's gonna get hurt!
Carlos!
Can you believe this?
Someone broke into our house.
Oh, my god.
And so ended the great
crime wave on wisteria lane.
No one ever found out
who was responsible...
ew. Honey, you're all sweaty.
Go clean up.
Because it was an inside job.

Desperate Housewives
Season 04 Episode 02
you will never see despair here...
Or rage.
You will never see
the tiniest bit of regre
you see, the people
who live here have learned
there is one sure way
of hiding their secrets... hey.
From their neighbors.
That's why, in the suburbs,
there is nothing more deceptive
than a smile.
So what did julie say,
exactly?
She said dylan's
not the same girl.
Not the same girl
like she's changed,
or not the same girl because she's been
replaced by a robot? I know it sounds weird,
but julie says dylan
does not remember anything
about living here.
Well,
maybe she blocked it out.
Did something bahappen to her
when she was young? I'm not sure.
But there was something odd
about the way they left.
So...
if it isn't the early morning
gossip brigade.
Who are we dishing today?
Uh, susan.
She's standing right there.
Oh, my god. Have you been there
this whole time?
Anyway, i wanted to talk
to you girls about lynette.
What about her? Well, since
she's been so tired from chemo,
i thought it'd be nice
if we did something for her,
like bring her lunch?
Uh, that sounds great.
Yeah, let's do it.
Um, gaby, why don't you bring
your vegetable lasagna?
Susan, you do beverages,
and, uh, katherine, why don't
you bring a simple green salad?
I'd rather bring dessert.
Oh, no need, dear.
I always bring dessert.
Oh, i'm thinking
my lemon meringue pie.
Oh, yum.
Yeah, here's the thing.
The movers lost my salad bowl.
My pie plates,
on the other hand...
will not be needed.
As i said,
i always bring dessert.
I know.
I will lend you
my salad bowl.
You really don't wanna miss
bree's pie. It's perfect.
Who am i to argue
with perfection?
Sorry. It's just, something
has been driving me crazy.
Now you're perfect.
D does it hurt?
It's a little uncomfortable,
but i'm fine.
Take a card.
Hey, i told you
i'm collecting queens.
Pay attention.
You remember we played this
when you were in labor
with parker?
42 hours without meds.
I'll never forget
what a trouper you were.
Well, let's not compose
my eulogy just yet.
I'm still troupin'.
Take a card.
Right.
It's funny.
We played cards on our honeymoon
the day that it rained.
Do you remember that?
We... we lit a fire...
you're doing it again.
Sorry.
Hey, i told you
i'm collecting queens.
Shoot. That's right.
Oh, my god.
Are you letting me win?
I just wanna make you
feel good.
By taking all the fun
t of the kill?
Honey, i'm sorry.
It's just...
I love you so much.
Out.
What?
You are supposed
to be distracting me,
not depressing
the hell out of me.
You're kicking me out
of chemo?
I'll see you at home.
Honey, i'm your ride.
Just go. I'll cab it.
There's that trouper
that i admire so much.
Out!
Carlos! Hi!
Hey,
there's my birthday girl.
Oh. Mmm!
It's a nice car.
We got company?
No.
Then whose is it?
It's... your birthday present
to me. Surprise!
A car. I was gonna get you
earrings.
So? Get 'em.
And i will drive around
with the top down
so everyone can see them.
Edie, i can't afford this.
Of course you can.
Just move some of
your offshore money onshore.
I told you,
that account was a secret,
which it's not gonna be
for long
if i start buying
$80,000 cars.
Now i'm sensing that
this little nest egg of yours
is a teensy bit illegal.
Where'd it come from?
You don't need to know that,
d the i. r. s. Doesn't, either.
You want me to go to jail?
Goodness, carlos.
L i had no idea
that your situation was so...
precarious.
Well... i guess
i'll just have to take this
back to the dealership.
Thank you for understanding,
babe.
Look, if... if you
don't want the earrings,
just pick something else out
instead.
Just not too extravagant.
Don't worry.
I have a thought,
and it's right
in your price range.
Oh! Hi. Hi.
Hey, katherine.
What's going on?
Why is there a moving van
in your driveway?
Oh, i meant to call you.
I, uh...
it's just been so nuts.
I got a new job... in chicago.
What? You're just leaving,
like that?
I know! It's crazy, huh?
I really wish i had time
to talk,
but i gotta finish packing.
Oh, whoa. No, hang on.
Let me just run and get julie so she can say
good-bye to dylan. Oh, we're really in a rush.
I don't think we're gonna
have time...
Th-that's okay, guys!
Keep packing! I'll clean it up!
Katherine?
Are you okay?
You seem a little jumpy.
I just had a-a long night,
and I-i have a lot to do.
I'm really gonna miss you.
Katherine, hi.
Oh, uh, i brought you
that salad bowl.
Oh, thank you.
You're so thoughtful.
No problem. Hey, you know,
i was meaning to ask you,
how did that job
in chicago work out?
Job?
You know, the one that
you left so suddenly for.
Oh, right. Yes, of course.
Uh, good.
Uh, it worked out well...
very challenging. Oh.
I've got something in the stove.
I've gotta go.
Oh.
Susan.
What?
I'm eating for two.
Well, do both of you
wanna be fat?
Okay, when i'm in labor
and i am pushing and screaming
to bring your child
into the world,
do you really want me
to remember
that you denied me syrup?
Carry on.
Mom, i need to talk
to you about tonight.
Oh, my god.
Is it about matt's party?
Yeah. It turns out
it doesn't start until 10:00,
so can i stay out till 1:00?
Well, uh, well, the johnsons
live right down the road.
Yeah, i guess that's fine.
Thanks.
Whoa, whoa. Is this the
johnsons over on crestview? Yeah.
Yeah, I-i don't think
you should go to that.
Why not? Well, i've done a
couple jobs at that house,
and they have some
really wild parties.
I don't even wanna tell you what i've
snaked out of that toilet. Those re
matt's not like that.
All 17-year-old guys
are like that.
The only reason my buddies
and i even had parties
was to get girls wasted.
Well, i don't drink.
Neither did missy taylor,
and fast-forward to her tying
her bra on my car antenna.
I really appreciate
your concern,
but my mom already told me
i could go.
Well, that's true.
Just giving my opinion.
It's up to your mom.
Uh, we...
i mean, you both make
a a good case.
Um... but i think i'm gonna
have to agree with, uh...
and you know i love you both...
decide.
Mike. I'm going with mike.
What?
Well, it sounds like this party
could be on the wild side,
and it is starting very late.
This is so unfair.
I'm sorry, honey.
You wanted aecision.
This is my decision.
More syrup?
Missy taylor?
Carry on.
Look at your little dylan,
all grown up.
Karen mccluskey.
I babysat you
way back when.
You were a biter.
Well,
i hope i didn't hurt you.
Nah, you were a cutie...
but loud.
I remember the racket you used
to make on your tricycle.
I gave your dad hell
four putting that horn on it.
My dad?
Mm-hmm.
How could
you know my dad?
He left
when i was a baby.
Nah, he used to come around
once in a while.
Anyway,
nice to have you back.
Please let me help.
I feel so guilty
just sitting here.
Do not move. We want to pamper
you, so please let us. Thank you.
Hey, so how's
the chemotherapy going?
Oh, no, no. She doesn't want to
talk about that. I don't mind.
Oh, come on. Let's dig in
to the pie. Looks amazing.
Wow.
Oh, my god. Bree, that is, like,
the best pie you've ever made.
Well, thank you. I don't think
i did anything differently.
This is not my pie.
okay,
you caught me. It's mine.
What happened to the pie that i
brought? Oh, i was a little sneaky,
and i put it in the fridge.
I just wanted you to try mine.
Well, did we
or did we not agree
that i would bring
the dessert?
I know, but everyone says
you're such an amazing baker,
and i was hoping
you would give me some tips
to improve my recipe.
Well, clearly no tips
are needed.
As my friends said,
"best pie ever made."
Well, then perhaps you
shouldn't have said anything.
I would have been happy for
everyone to think it was yours.
So back to chemo...
how's that been?
Yeah, so far...
not that bad.
Though i did have to
kick tom out yesterday.
Why?
He was getting so emotional.
It felt like the last 20 minutes
of "brian's song."
So... i guess i'm in the market
for a new chemo buddy.
Well, i would be more
than happy to go with you.
Count me in.
I'll sit with you.
I volunteer at the hospital,
so i'll be there anyway.
Oh! My god, you guys.
I'm so touched you're all
willing to do this.
What are friends for?
Gaby?
Staged
your lemon meringue pie?
You've gotta be kidding.
I'm not.
That despicable woman
was just supposed to bring
a simple green salad.
She not only brought
a pie...
she hid mine
and served hers.
Well, that's beyond despicable.
That's culinary terrorism.
Oh, it gets worse.
Her pie was better than mine.
Impossible.
It's true.
Everyone thought so.
Even me. Oh, and that
simple green salad...
mache and baby arugula with
duck confit and candied walnuts!
My god, she plays to win.
I have been here for hours
trng to replicate her recipe,
and nothing has
even comclose!
Don't be so hard on yourself.
This one's fantastic.
That's hers!
Sorry.
Orson, what am i gonna do?
You might have
to bite the bullet
and ask her for her recipe.
What? Surrender?
Debase myself?
Bree,
it's your signature pie.
You make it for parties,
church suppers, bake sales.
If she's always right there
behind you
with her superior version,
staking out her claim
as fairview's number one
homemaker...
she will have stolen
my entire identity.
Well,
i wouldn't go that far.
No, it's true.
The only thing about me
that's special
is what i can do
in the kitchen.
You're right.
I have got
to get that recipe...
by any means necessary.
Hey, gaby.
Hey, what's up?
Well...
i felt a little weird
about something
that happened at lunch,
and i thought
we should talk about it.
I know. Do you believe
that pie business?
I thought bree's head
was gonna explode.
o, not that.
Okay, i don't know how
to say this,
so i'm just gonna say it.
When everyone was offering
to come with me to chemo...
even katherine,
who i don't even know,
you sort of clammed up.
What was that about?
Well, it just seemed like people
had it pretty well covered.
Yeah, but between us,
you're the onel really want there.
Out of everyone,
you're the most fun,
and i need that now.
Oh, that's sweet.
But to be honest,
i don't like hospitals.
Nobody likes hospitals.
Unfortunately, that's the place
you have to go
when you're sick,
or your friends are.
You are my friend, right?
What, is this a test
of our friendship?
Yeah... kinda.
Can i pencil you in?
I can't wait.
psst! Come here.
Okay, i'll come there.
Are you still mad at me
about the party?
Oh, you picked up on that,
did you?
Okay, look, i've been
thinking about things, and...
just forget
what i said earlier.
You mean i can go?
Shh! Jeez! Ooh, mike's in the other
room. You're not gonna tell him?
No, and neither are you. why
are you walking on eggshells?
You are my mother. You have every
right to override him. I know.
I just... i think it's sweet
that he worries about you,
and i want him to feel
like he's part
of the decision making
process.
Well, clearly he's not if
you're going behind his back.
Do you wanna go or not?
Yes! Yes, i really wanna
go to the party.
Party? You guys still
talking about that?
can you believe it?
Ugh! Let it go.
You know, mike and i decided...
no party, and that's final.
Bree.
I hope this isn't
a bad time.
I just wanted to bring you
a housewarming gift.
It's the recipe for
my special mincemeat pie.
It wouldn't be thanksgiving
at my house without it.
Well...
aren't you thoughtful?
Let me just file this
in my recipe box.
Well, as long as we're
swapping pie recipes,
i would love the one for
your fabulous lemon meringue.
Really? I'm so flattered
you'd ask.
But i don't share that.
Excuse me?
You have to understand...
i experimented for years
before i came up
with my secret ingredient.
Which is what?
Vanilla? Nutmeg? Cardamom?
If i told you, it wouldn't
be a secret anymore.
It would just be
an ingredient.
Well, that, um,
hardly seems neighborly.
After all, i just gave you
the recipe for my mincemeat pie.
Yes, and it's a very good one.
I have the book it came from.
That recipe is not
from a book.
That recipe was handed down
to me from my mother.
Well, unless your mother
was betty crocker,
she got it from a book.
Oh, dear.
Now i've upset you.
No. No, i am not upset.
I'm just confused as to why
you seem so determined
to get off
on the wrong foot.
First you bring a pie
to lynette's,
when i clearly assigned you
the salad...
now, see,
that's where i'm confused.
Just what, please,
gives you the right
to decide who brings what
to a luncheon that i suggested?
Well, it's tradition.
I always organize
our little get-togethers,
and i always bring dessert.
Well, then
how lovely that i'm back
and can shouer
that burden for you.
Just... give me the recipe!
Sorry. I can't.
I do hope this doesn't
keep us from being friends,
because i like you, bree.
And i'm sure
if you put your mind to it,
you can come up
with an even better
lemon meringue pie than mine.
The trick is finding that
perfect blend of sweet and sour.
Well, you've certainly
mastered that, dear.
So when do i get to see
my big surprise?
Wait for it. Wait for it.
Ta-da.
Whoa.
All that syrup went straight to your boobs.
So it's not my imagination.
They're bigger, right?
Uh, yeah.
Especially the right one.
Mike!
Just kidding.
Pick those up and bring 'em over here.
Well, i'd better warn you.
I may have to work the shoulders.
Mmm. Hey.
That thing with julie and
the party this morning...
mm-hmm?
Thanks for backing me up.
It meant a lot,
and i know it wasn't easy for you.
Uh, yeah, well, you know,
sometimes you gotta hang tough.
Mm, well,
you did the right thing.
I drove by that house tonight.
Mm-hmm?
That party was out of control.
What?
Yeah, there were kids staggering around drunk...
puking in the gutter,
and then i saw some girls running around topless.
I'm sure the cops will be there any minute.
We need whipped cream.
What?
Well
i don't think that
you can have sexy date night without whipped cream.
Can't and won't.
Well, i...
i can go get some.
No, no, you've, uh, worked all day.
You stay here.
I'll go to the store.
Could you get more syrup?
Make a wish.
So i'm dying to see what i got you.
How thoughtful was i?
Very.
Open it.
"Yes!"
Not yet.
I haven't asked the question.
Will you marry me, carlos solis?
And you say...
you're proposing?
You said you didn't want to spend too much.
So what's more affordable than a promise?
Look, edie...
i'm doing this for you.
If the i. r. s. Gets wind of your...
rainy day fund,
they could make me testify against you.
But if i were your wife...
how are they going to find out?
Oh, honey, people talk...
angry people, disappointed people.
Come on.
Say your line.
It's my birthday.
Fine.
We're engaged.
Oh! Carlos!
I think i'm gonna cry.
Yeah, me, too.
I mean, how weird is that?
My mom always told methat my dad took off
right after i was born.
So did she explain what mccluskey said?
I didn't tell her.
She kinda freaks out anytime i bring him up.
Dylan, you have a right to know about your dad.
You've got to confront her.
Yeah, right.
I could never do that.
She isn't cool like your mom.
Hi. It's my birthday.
Oh, that must mean you're matt.
I'm susan mayer, and i'm...
all righty.
You magnificent bastard!
You actually did it!
It wasn't me,
but happy birthday, man.
Well, it was somebody.
Who cares? Gather 'round, men.
So you like this music?
Ah, it's fine.
Would somebody just tell me where i can find...
hey, enough talking.
Just take it off.
We're feeling generous tonight.
Oh, my god!
I'm not a stripper.
You're not?
Is this gonna happen or what?
Boomer, she's not a stripper.
What's with the implants?
I'm pregnant.
That's hot.
Sorry.
Should've known you were julie's mom.
You're way too gorgeous to be a stripper.
If that's your lame attempt
to keep me from calling your parents...
it worked. Well played.
Excuse me. Oh. Aah!
Uh, uh...
mom, what are you doing here?
I am taking you home.
This party is out of control.
No, it's not.
Well, of course
you don't think it is
because yore knocking back a big cup of...
mm... orange soda.
I don't believe this.
Well, believe it. We're going.
You, too, dylan. Come on.
And what are you wearing?
It's embarrassing.
Yeah, well, boomer likes it.
Call me tomorrow.
We'll go to a movie my mom
can drag us out of.
Look, i get that you're upset.
No, i'm confused.
First, i can go to the party,
then i can't because mike says no.
Then i can, but "don't tell mike and behave yourself."
So i behave myself,
and you punish me.
Okay, i admit that there's a
certain lack of consistency there.
It's like...
ever since you got married,
i can't win.
Do you think this is easy for me?
Trying to keep peace
between a new husband
and a teenage daughter?
You're always putting me
in the middle.
Ugh. I don't do that.
Please.
Every time you and mike
disagree on something,
you give me the look...
that pitiful face
that says if i don't back you up,
i love the other one more.
I don't expect you to side
with me every time.
Just make a decision and stick to it.
And no more lying.
Well, you're right.
I'm an adult, and i need to be
honest about these things,
and i will be... starting tomorrow.
Hey.
Look who i picked up coming
out of the movies...
a p. g. Movie.
Is this the perfect teenager or what?
Oh, the movies, huh?
That's funny.
'Cause one of julie's
friends just called
to make sure she got
home from the party.
She was worried
when she saw you leaving
with a stripper.
The jig is up, mom.
No, no, we can salvage this.
Just work with me.
I did go to the party.
Mom went behind your back
and told me i could.
But I-i didn't drink or do
anything i shouldn't have.
Glad to hear it,
and, uh,
thanks for your honesty.
You know,
this perfect teenager thing
is really starting to chap my ass.
I'm going to bed.
Please tell me this isn't
gonna be one of those things
where you leave me and i go
screaming down the street.
Why'd you go behind my back?
I'm sorry.
You gotta understand, for so long,
it's just been
julie and me,
and i've made
all the decisions alone.
You felt so strongly.
It was just an opinion, really.
She's your daughter.
I completely respect
your right
to raise her
however you want.
Thanks.
Now that being said,
this baby is ours.
So we'll get to make
all those parenting decisions
together, right?
Right.
So can we go back
to date night?
Ly if you work
the shoulders.
Oh.
Mmm.
Gaby, where have you been?
You went to the bathroom,
like, half an hour ago.
Oh, sorry. I stopped off
to get you some magazines.
"Top ten new hairstyles."
Yeah, well, i'm kinda bald
right now, but thanks.
Why n't i go check
if there are some other ones?
No, no, i don't need magazines.
I need you've been bouncing around
since you got here.
So...
how do you like being the first
lady of fairview? It's good.
Are you cold?
They keep it cold in here.
I'm fine.
So tell me something.
When you go to a ribbon cutting,
do you get to keep those
gigantic novelty scissors?
You must be freezing.
You know, i have
the cutest shawl in the car,
so i'm just gonna run out
and get it for you.
Boy, you really don't wanna
be here, do ya?
What are you talking about?
I'm trying to help.
Yeah, in any way
that gets you out of this room.
I'm sorry. It's just
hospitals are hard for me.
Yeah, you told me,
but, jeez, gaby,
don't you care enough
to make an effort?
You think i don't care?
I get it.
You're uncomfortable.
Just go. I'm fine.
I'm fine.
Did i ever tell you
about my father?
He had cancer, too.
Started in the liver,
went into his bones,
and ten months later,
he was dead.
Thanks for
that encouraging story.
I'm not finished.
Those last weeks,
every day we thought
we were gonna lose him.
And every day, before i
would go into his room,
my mom would say,
"no tears.
"Daddy wants to see you
smiling.
If you're gonna cry,
you can't go in."
So... on the last night...
i sat there
and i watched him die.
His eyes were closed,
but i thought
he could still see me.
So i kept smiling...
all night.
I was 5.
Oh, my god.
But on the plus side,
i made a pretty good career
out of knowing how to smile
when i didn't really feel
like it.
But i can't pretend
with you.
Not when i'm scared
i'm gonna lose you.
You're not gonna lose me.
You promise?
'Cause if i did...
then...
God! I'm such a mess.
It's okay. Come here.
Let it go. Oh.
honey?
I'm going to get adam.
Be right back.
Can i talk to you
about something?
Sure. If you don't mind
talking in the car.
Bree hodge persisted
in her effor
to unlocthe secret
of katherine mayfair's
lemon meringue.
But after
several failed attempts,
it occurred to bree
that while she might not have
the key
to katherine's recipe...
she did have the key...
to katherine's house.
Oh, hey, what's up?
I was doing a little baking,
and i was wondering
if i could borrow something.
Sure. What do you need...
flour, sugar?
You can't believe what
karen mccluskey tells you.
She's an old woman...
practically senile.
She didn't sound senile
to me.
Dylan, maybe this is not
the time, okay?
You said my father
didn't care about me,
but she says he came here.
He wanted to see me.
Why wod you not
tell me that?
He's my father.
I deserve to know.
The only thing you need
to know about that man
is he was a monster.
I can decide that for myself.
Where is he?
I don't know.
You're lying.
No, she's not.
Yes, she is.
She has been lying to me
my whole life.
I'm starting to think
maybe you're the monster.
She can't talk to me
that way,
not after everything
i've done for her.
Well, maybe that's
the problem.
She doesn't know
what you've done for her.
Nobody does,
and it's gonna stay that way.
Are you sure? She's just
gonna keep asking questions.
Then we'd better start
coming up with better lies.
Oh, there you are.
I was wondering
where you'd gone to.
I just let myself
into katherine's house
to get that recipe.
Well, that seems
a bit extreme.
Well, at least
you know her secret now.
Yes, and it has nothing
to do with pie.
Ahh. Here's the thing.
I got a real chance at getting
back together with my ex,
but this woman
is standing in my way.
And she knows about the money,
and she's made it clear
that if i leave,
she's gonna blow the whistle.
You gotta understand...
i really did care
for edie,
but i can't let her
ruin my life.
That's where you come in.
You guys, we better behave,
or the nurses
are gonna kick us out.
Hey, it's our chemo party,
and we'll laugh if we want to.
Gaby, this was
a wonderful idea.
I cannot tell you
how much it means to me.
Well, don't get sappy on me.
I won't stand for it.
All right, susan,
is the camera ready?
Yeah.
Got it.
Okay, once the light
starts blinking,
we've got three seconds,
so, everybody, say, "cheese"
and holdt.
Okay.
One, two, three.
cheese!
There is nothing more deceptive
than a smile,
and no one knows this better
than the people
who hide behind them.
Some flash their teeth
as a polite warning
to their enemies.
Some put on beaming faces to
keep their tears from falling.
Others wear silly grins
to mask their fear.
Mm!
But then
there is that rare smile
that is actually genuine.
I'll take care of it.
It's the smile of a person
who knows his troubles
will soon be over.
Previously on
Desperate Housewives...
Bree discovered
a family secret.
Oh, I'm gonna be sick.
Lynette struggled
with chemotherapy...
while susan took joy
in being pregnant...
I'm eating for two.
The biggest obstacle
to Carlos and Gaby...
The I.R.S. Could make me
testify against you.
Was the promise edie forced
Carlos to make. We're engaged.
I really did care for edie,
But I can't let her
ruin my life.
trevor! Over here!
all children
love to play games.
But before
they can race their bikes
Or jump their ropes
Or toss their frisbees,
Children understand they must
first convince their friends
To play along with them.
The same is true for adults.
Hi, Gaby. It's me.
I'm throwing a party
saturday night.
Guess what kind?
A charades party?
Didn't you just throw one?
No, that was a year ago.
Oh. Right. Guess it's time
for another one.
Sure is. Can you come?
Um... sorry.
Victor needs me
at this... political thing.
Damn. Damn, damn.
Aw! You have to come.
You'u're the best
charades player I know.
That's sweet...
and totally accurate.
But I'm really whipped
from the chemo, so...
oh, there's my other line.
Can you ask me next time,
okay, hon? Okay, bye.
Hello?
Oh, hey, bree.
Mm, what's up?
Well, I stopped by katherine's
last night just to get a recipe,
And you'll never believe
what I overheard.
She slapped her kid?! No!
Yes, and get this...
when adam said dylan was just
going to keep asking questions,
Katherine said...
and I quote...
"well, we're just gonna
have to find better lies."
Qoh, hang on. I've got
another call. Don't answer it!
It's susan. She's hosting
another game night.
Another one? It's time
for an anonymous letter.
Wait... is katherine going
to susan's charade night?
Probably. Why?
We should go, too.
Get a few drinks in her,
see if she loosens up.
Well, I doubt
a woman like katherine
Is gonna spill her secrets
Just because she's had a
little wine. I don't know.
You came out with
some interesting things
Before you swore off the
sauce. Well, none that I recall.
Didn't you tell me
you lost your virginity
In the backseat of a... point
well taken. I'll bring the wine.
Susan, good news.
We can come to the party
after all.
Hey, you know who else
you should invite?
Yeah, I am feeling much better,
so count me in.
Will our new neighbor
be coming?
Of course!
I love your charades parties.
And I hope you're inviting that
delightful katherine mayfair.
So you were paid
a very nice compliment today.
I was?
Yes.
I am hosting
a charades party,
And all of my friends
went out their way
To insist I invite you.
Really?
Mm-Hmm.
Yes, not all adults
like to play games.
But the ones who do...
play to win.
Desperate housewives
season 04 epdisode 03
Stella wingfield
hated to cook.
Still, she spent
that friday morning
Grating cheese...
and greasing a pan...
and laying in macaroni
Because her eldest daughter
was sick,
And stella could no longer
sit by and do nothing.
Lunchtime!
Oh. No, thanks.
Oh, come on.
I made it for you special.
You've gotta
keep your strength up.
I appreciate the effort,
But I told you,
i can't keep anything down,
And f. Y.I., mac and cheese
is halfway to vomit.
You might as well have given me
a plate of creamed corn.
Aren't you taking
the anti-Nausea drug?
Yeah, I am taking it.
It's just... not working.
Oh. Well, um...
i know something that might
help your nausea
And boost your appetite.
Um... perhaps a little visit
from my old friend...
mary jane?
You're suggesting pot?
A lot of chemo patients
use it. Hell, I did.
Yeah.
Oh, come on.
Let mama score you
some kick-Ass chronic.
"Kick-Ass chronic"?
Uh-Huh.
You're a grandmother.
Shouldn't you be off somewhere
knitting an afghan?
Just trying
to ease your pain.
Well, thanks,
But I prefer
not to get my medication
From some guy
under a bridge.
Suit yourself.
Hey.
What's this?
A crib.
Oh, and look...
safety latch.
I figured if the baby
takes after you,
"Accident-Proof" is key.
Honey, you know, I'm still
in my first trimester.
Um, don't you think
it's a little early
To be making cribs?
Early would be
painting it pink or blue.
But...
i got both,
so we're covered either way.
great.
And whether
it's a boy or a girl,
Colts fan.
That's non-Negotiable.
Mm.
Um, bree's home.
I'll be right back.
Look sharp. It's susan.
God, it's getting
harder and harder
To keep her
at arm's length.
I never knew
she was such a hugger.
You want me to run
interference? No, no?
Yeah? Good.
Hey, susan! What's up?
I need a favor.
Um, I remember you
mentioning
That you liked
your obstetrician.
Can I get his number?
I thought
you were using dr. Mayfair.
Yeah, I don't know.
It's getting a little weird.
You know,
adam is my neighbor.
But you don't mind
orson being your dentist.
Well, that's because
i don't blush
When orson says,
"open wide."
You know, my o. B.
Is all the way across town.
You just do not want
to drive that far.
Oh, well, we could schedule
our appointments together
And carpool.
You know...
pregnant gals on the road.
it does sound fun,
But I don't think my doctor's
taking on any new patients.
Oh, I can talk him into it.
What's his name?
I, um...
don't remember.
You don't remember?
No. You know, I usually
just call him "doctor."
bree,
just get me the number.
Ooh.
Here you go, but please
don't mention my name.
As I said, you know,
he's overbooked,
And I just don't want
to get on his bad side.
I'm so excited. Pregnant gals
sharing a doctor!
Ah-Choo!
Oh, bless you. Oh! Sorry,
probably just allergies,
But, you know, you don't want
to take any chances.
right.
Hey.
Can I get a drink?
Yeah, sure.
By the way,
you missed a spot.
Oh, thanks.
Anytime.
I'd say
the car is clean enough.
Katherine.
You two seemed awfully friendly.
Do you know her?
No. We said two words. She criticized
my car washing. Hmm. It's funny.
When I criticize you, you don't
put on a big, goofy grin.
You really need
to stop this.
Given our history, shouldn't i
be saying that to you?
Katherine, I can't
just not speak to women.
I'm a gynecologist,
for god's sake.
Yes, I know.
But you don't have to bring
your work home with you.
You leaving already?
Ah, edie asked me to help her
pick out a gift for her sister,
So I gotta
swing by the mall.
When can I see you next?
Well, victor has
a teachers' union thing
On thursday.
Guess I'll see you
on thursday.
Carlos,
what's happening here?
I mean, with us. Why are we
still sneaking around?
You know exactly why.
Oh, come on. Edie's recovered
from her little suicide attempt.
Don't you think it's time to move
on? I've got some things going on,
And I need them to pay off
before I can make a move.
Really,
i don't have a choice.
Okay, but if you did
have a choice,
Would it be a hard one?
I mean, it's not like you're
in love with edie, is it?
No, I don't love edie.
And I've got a plan to get her
out of my life forever.
Just give me two weeks, okay?
A bracelet's always nice.
For edie's sister.
Good idea.
Here's the thing...
my daughter has cancer.
She's so nauseous,
she's stopped eating,
And I can't just stand by
and watch her waste away.
So I asked around,
And people thought you might
be able to get me what I need.
You follow my drift?
Um... yeah.
You... you want me
to score you some weed.
The best stuff you can get.
Nothing's too good
for my little girl.
Darling?
What is it?
Well,
i don't want you to worry.
I I just got off the phone
with the convent.
It seems danielle
took a little spill.
You're 81/2 months pregnant!
What in heaven's name
were you doing roller-Blading?
I'm bored.
All I do is lay around.
In your condition,
that's what you should be doing.
And where on earth
did you get skates in a convent?
I borrowed them from one
of the eating disorder girls.
They have all
the good exercise equipment.
Danielle,
What if your reckless behavior
had hurt the baby?
They're going to examine me.
I'm sure the baby's fine.
Yes, and it is going
to stay that way
Because I have instructed
sister theresa
To keep you sequestered
in your room
Until the baby is born. What
am I supposed to do for fun?
You won't even get me
a dvd player.
Well, I was hoping that you
could use these last few weeks
For reflection
and personal growth.
I hate you.
Clearly,
it would be time well spent.
How was the lasagna?
Why don't you
ask it yourself?
Honey.
Sorry.
At least eat a little.
We need you in fighting form
for charades tonight.
Yeah, about that...
i don't think I'm gonna make it.
You have to! You are
the charades assassin.
They still talk about
the night that you guessed
"The americanization of emily"
in 15 seconds.
12.
And that's my point.
I'm undefeated.
Why spoil my winning streak
By playing
when I'm not up to it?
Honey, people...
know that you're sick.
They don't expect you
to be at your absolute best.
Tom, hair loss
and constant nausea...
those are inconveniences.
Losing at charades
to susan meyer...
that is just
flat-Out intolerable.
Hey, andrew.
Hey.
What's up?
Hey, mr. Scavo, um,
A package for lynette's mom
got delivered to our house
By mistake, so... oh! I'm
coming. I've got it, tom.
It's a pattern. I'm...
knitting lynette an afghan.
A friend of mine
recommended this place.
It's not exactly what
i expected.
Must be one heck of a doctor,
though, huh?
I don't know. I just come here
to buy clean urine.
Shoo!
Those are only for grown-Ups. Why?
Because that have
special medicine in them.
Like the grown-Up iced tea
you always drink?
Similar. How about
some ice cream instead?
And you can watch tv
till your eyes fall out.
Yeah!
Awesome.
You stay.
Grandma needs a favor,
And you've got
just the face for it.
Wow, sweetie.
Those really look delicious,
But I just don't feel like
eating right now.
Just one, mom?
I made them special...
just for you.
Mmm.
This really is delicious.
Now if there's an emergency,
You can reach me
on my cell phone.
Or they can just
walk across the street.
Have fun, girls.
Don't do anything I would do.
Adam seems
really laid-Back.
yeah, he's pretty cool.
Of course, everyone seems cool
compared to robo-Mom.
hey, you never told me.
What happened when you
asked her about your real dad?
She freaked out,
just like I thought.
She wouldn't tell me
anything.
Well...
there are other ways
to find things out.
Does your mom keep
any old papers?
You know,
letters, diaries?
Not that she shows me.
There's stuff
in the storage room upstairs,
But it's locked,
so forget about it.
What kind of lock is it?
Oh, come on in.
I was hoping you were susan.
She's not here?
No, and she's not answering
her cell phone. Where is she?
Well, she had an appointment
with this new obstetrician
Over on river street,
but she should be here by now.
Why would she see a doctor
over there?
That's a terrible
neighborhood. It is?
Yes. Don't you remember?
That's where they murdered
those two prostitutes last year.
We should help mike
with the food.
Knock, knock.
we're here.
Oh, good!
Katherine, I was hoping
we'd get a chance to chat.
open this now.
Ugh. Susan's parties are
always such a snoozefest.
The only thing
people will be miming is
"Get me the hell
out of here."
Aren't you a little overdressed
for charades?
Oh, I thought
that I'd look nice,
Just in case
we decided to...
oh, I don't know...
announce our engagement?
we're not
announcing anything.
It's susan and mike's party.
I do not want to make it
all about us.
You're right, darling.
I may drop a few hints,
though.
Edie, let me be clear
on this.
You are not to tell anyone
about our engagement, got it?
Fine. I won't say a word.
Oh, this is fantastic.
You know edward ferber?
State senator?
Yes.
His wife just got
picked up for shoplifting.
Why is that fantastic?
He was making noises
About going against me
for governor.
I guess
the light-Fingered mrs. Ferber
Just put an end to that.
Why? It's not like
he shoplifted.
It doesn't matter.
It's a scandal.
You know what they do to poll
numbers. oh, that's right.
I was reading about that in
"politics is boring" magazine.
I'm just glad
i don't have to worry
About you pulling crap like
that. Yeah, you're lucky.
So where's lynette?
She's usually
your charades m. V.P.
Ah, she wasn't feeling
so well,
But, uh, you are still
going down, mister.
It's just a game, tom...
a game you wish
you never played.
So much work...
ahem.
Oh, hi, Gaby.
Katherine and I were just
talking about the old days.
So when you were living
with your aunt,
Was dylan's father with you?
No, just me and dylan.
Were you widowed
or divorced?
Actually, I prefer not
to discuss my first marriage...
if you don't mind.
Oh. Well, we certainly
didn't mean to pry.
Let me just
tidge that up for you.
Hello, all.
Ah, it's so nice to see you.
Some wine?
Oh, no.
Oh, my contact slipped.
Edie,
is that an engagement ring?
Oh! Uh, shoot.
Pretend you didn't see that.
I promised my fianc?
That I wouldn't say a word
Until
the official announcement.
Excuse me.
Gaby! Sorry I'm late.
oh, my god!
You made it.
That is such a beautiful dress.
We're gonna have so much fun.
You... come with me.
She's got a ring!
What?
Edie... she's wearing
a big, honkin' engagement ring
The size of a peach pit.
Hey, I didn't get her a ring!
Oh, so you're not engaged?
Well, see, here's the thing...
oh, you gotta be kidding me!
Let me explain!
No, no, no. I am done
with your explanations,
And I am done with "just
give me two more weeks, baby."
Whatever games you're playing,
I'm sick of it. We're through.
So you're just gonna
go and live
Happily ever after
with victor, huh?
you think victor's
my only option?
Well, I got news for you,
Carlos.
I can have any guy I want,
because this...
waits for no man.
You bought yourself
an engagement ring?
It's been three days, Carlos.
How long was I supposed to wait?
You agreed
not to say anything.
Ah, but I didn't agree
not to wear anything.
Don't worry.
It wasn't expensive.
You can pay me back later.
Count on it.
And the whole time, I just kept
thinking, this is bree's doctor.
Bree recommended him.
He must be the best.
So I didn't worry when it was
between a needle exchange
And the area's only
transvestite bookstore.
And I ignored that my shoes
stuck to the floor
And there was
a cigarette machine
In the waiting room,
But when I saw the ant traps
on his speculum tray,
I thought that you and i
should have a talk.
Oh, susan, I am so sorry,
and, of course,
I will pay for the slashed tire and the
stolen cell phone. That is not the point!
Why would you send me
to somebody
Who is obviously
not your doctor?
I can't tell you.
Why not?
Uh... it's private.
You know what else
is private?
The parts of me
that I'm pretty sure
He snapped
with his camera phone.
I have a party to throw.
I will deal with you later.
Oh!
look, al,
she is totally out of control.
I need her taken care of.
Fine.
I'll see what I can do.
I promised my fianc?
That I wouldn't say a word
until the official announcement.
Adam, I feel the tag
of my dress sticking out,
And I can't reach it.
Do you mind?
Oh, sure.
There you go.
Ooh! I think I got a chill.
Now let me see if I can give
you one. Oh, yeah, it worked.
we haven't
been here an hour,
And you're already humiliating
me? Are we really having?
Oh, I guess you learned
nothing from chicago.
For god sake,
i was not flirting.
She asked me to fix her
dress. Yeah. I saw your face.
I could tell what a chore it
was for you. You know what?
I think I'm a little behind you
in the alcohol department.
Let me go catch up.
I'm sorry.
I, uh, didn't mean
to eavesdrop,
But you really shouldn't
take this out on adam.
Gabrielle has a little bit
of a reputation,
If you know what I mean.
No, I don't.
But I'd certainly like to.
Okay, everybody,
let the games begin.
Um, okay.
I will be team captain one.
Who wants to be
captain number two?
I'll do it.
Great.
okay, you pick first.
Oh, okay.
I will pick adam.
Ah.
I pick lynette.
Where's lynette?
Uh, she really wanted
to be here.
She's just feeling
too sick to party.
That's funny, isn't it?
Are you kidding? It's genius.
He's a sponge, but he talks!
Well, looks like somebody
is feeling a little better.
Yeah. I guess
that anti-Nausea medicine
Finally kicked in.
That must be it.
Orson.
Carlos.
Um...
husband in the room?
Honey, I love you,
but I wanna win.
You should pick edie.
Why?
The woman just tried
to commit suicide.
Don't make her last pick.
She's still fragile.
Good point. Mike!
Yes! Let's get started.
No, no! Wait, wait, wait.
Gaby, you know how it works.
Okay, first, I have to go over
all the signals.
okay, so, um,
This is "movie," um, "tv"...
where did you learn
to do this?
When you live with a mother who
constantly locks herself out,
You develop certain skills.
I don't know. Maybe this is
a sign we should stop.
What were you saying
about signs?
"A whole concept,"
"person," um, let's see.
"Shakespeare," "book," and then
if you do the signal for "book"
And you touch your heart,
then that's "poem."
Okay, when has anyone ever used a poem
as a clue? Yeah, come on. Let's play.
Let's play!
Yeah! Let's play!
Hey, honey! You made it. Ha!
Dibs on lynette! She's on my team!
That's not fair.
She's like the charades ninja.
That's me! The ninja!
Whaa-Ya! Whaa!
Ahh!
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...
Okay. okay!
I'm ready.
Okay, go.

Sock.
Working out.

itch. Itch. Scratch. Oh. Aah.
A blister.
Ha!
Sounds like "blister.
"Sister. kissed her.
"Two mules for sister sara"!
Okay, 22 seconds. Lynette,
you're up. come on, babe.
We're 40 seconds down. We need
you to make that time up.
Who do you think you're
talking to? Right on.
all right. Whoo!
Ready? Get set... go.
Okay.
Honey, clock's ticking.
I know. Just,
this is a really hard one.
Okay, come on, come on.
What is... what is it?
Is it a book? Is it a movie?
Movie. It's a western.
No talking.
Sorry.
Honey,
start with the first word.
How many syllables?
Ugh.
One word.
Sweetie, act it out.
You're really good at that.
Okay, okay.
Whole idea.
Me.
Edie.
Woman. Blonde. Bleach!
oh!
Aah!
Aah!
"Hang 'em high"?
Yes! Yes!
yes!
Okay. Well, I think
it's time for a break.
Good idea.
Yeah.
you feeling okay?
'Cause you're... acting
kinda spacey.
Yeah, no, I'm good.
Hey, do you think they have
any grapes or lobster?
Why... why don't I go get you
some coffee, hon?
Uh, um, orson?
Hmm?
Hey, um, there's a phone call
for you at the house.
You should probably
take it.
Uh, thanks. Yeah.
Hi.
Hello.
Hello.
Oh, tom.
Stella, what...
what are you doing here?
Uh... I made some brownies
earlier,
And I just... noticed
they were missing.
Uh... lynette didn't
bring them here, did she?
Why? Is that a problem?
It's like chocolate love.
Oh!
Okay, wait, wait, wait.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Sorry, uh, don't eat those.
Don't eat those. Sorry.
Uh, no! Ooh. Bad batch.
Bad. Bad, bad, bad.
Whoa. sorry.
Full of trans fats.
Oh!
Oh!
Oh! Tom, watch it!
I am sorry.
Oh, here. Oh.
Let me get that.
Thank you.
Oh, god. Okay.
It's a little cold.
Sorry.
It's all right.
Would it be too much
to ask you
To keep your hands
off my husband?
What?
I spilled my drink on him.
And you're trying to make up
for it by breast-Feeding him?
Uh, katherine?
Look, lady,
you need to calm down.
You're getting a reputation
around here
For having a stick
up your ass.
Better that reputation than the one you're
toting around. What do you mean by that?
Okay, back to charades.
Never mind. Forget it.
Oh, no, no. Tell me.
What's my "reputation"?
Am I smug
and holier-Than-Thou?
Oh, no, wait.
That's you.
Let me be specific.
By "reputation," I mean
that you are the kind of woman
That treats a man
like a plaything,
Whether it's my husband or let's
say... your teenage gardener?
Bree saw you slap
your daughter.
Excuse me?
Gaby!
Yeah, she asked about her father
and then you smacked her.
Why'd you do that?
This is the last thing
that I will ever say to you.
Yes, I lost my temper
with dylan,
But her father
is a horrible man.
I want you to imagine
the worst thing
That a father can do
to his daughter.
What was I supposed
to tell dylan about that, hmm?
I hope that satisfies
everyone's curiosity.
Oh, my god.
"Hang 'em high"
has three syllables.
I guess you... saw
what happened down there.
Yep.
Look,
it was a long time ago,
And... and it didn't mean
anything.
How many people
know about this?
Now or before tonight?
How many?
Look, I know you're upset.
I'm not upset.
I'm just trying to work out
how to spin this.
Clearly,
the boy was underage.
Do you think
money would shut him up?
Victor, really, I don't think
it's a big deal.
Hmm. That's because
you're not me.
Okay, you've got
to remember this.
This is bodsworth.
You took him everywhere.
No, I think I'd remember
a bear that ugly.
Well, clearly, it's yours.
Your mom kept it
all these years,
And he's here
in your old room.
Wait. This was my old room?
My mom told me
I'm in my old room
down the hall.
No, this was your room.
What are you talking about?
Evening, girls.
Hey. How was the party?
It was lovely.
I think your mother would
like you home to help clean up.
I'm sorry, mom.
It's okay, sweetie.
But I don't want you
seeing that girl anymore.
Orson, honey,
where have you been?
We got a call
from danielle's doctor.
Apparently, her fall caused
a placental abruption,
Where the placenta separates
from the uterus. Oh, my god.
Now they said not to panic.
There are degrees of this.
They're doing a sonogram,
then they're gonna call us.
I can't wait that long.
I have to be with her.
Okay. I'll get your purse.
Hmm?
What do you think you're doing?
You can't leave yet.
Something's come up.
We'll talk tomorrow.
No, we'll talk now.
You still owe me an explanation
for that scuzzy gyno
You sent me to. I said I was
sorry. For god sakes, susan,
Not everything is about you.
Oh, I know this night
has been a complete disaster,
But all in all, it's still
your best party ever.
I'm confused.
Ow! Now I'm confused,
and my head hurts.
That's for letting edie think
you're engaged. And the kiss?
When you saw me flirting,
you smashed a glass.
When victor heard
i had an affair,
He started crunching
poll numbers.
I need a man
who cares enough to explode
When he thinks
he's gonna lose me.
I don't just love you.
Ilovethe way you love me.
So we're back on?
See you thursday.
Al, what have you got for me?
I think I found a way
to make this happen,
But it might take a week or two
to line everything up.
Fantastic.
I'll call you when it's done.
Shirley?
Can you make some copies
of the britt file?
Ahh.
Seen Gaby?
Uh, yeah,
in the bathroom upstairs.
Tell me something.
When you found out
that kid who you were paying
To mow your lawn
was doing your wife,
How did you not kill him?
Well, I wanted to at first,
but...
hey, we're all human, right?
We gotta forgive and forget.
You're
a very understanding man.
If she pulled
something like that on me,
That guy wouldn't be around
for long.
Yeah, but no woman's worth
going to jail for, right?
If you have enough money,
It's not that hard
to make someone disappear.
Let's go, honey.
Night, Carlos.
Darling,
what are you doing?
I have to bring
this dvd player to danielle.
Honey, we really have to go.
It'll just take a few seconds.
These damn cords...
sweetheart, it's a long drive.
It's the only thing she asked for.
yes. Hello?
Hello, doctor.
How is she?
Thank god.
oh, my god.
It's gonna be okay.
Kids are all tucked in.
They're sleeping
like angels.
Great. Did you put quaaludes
in their cocoa?
Could you check on 'em for me,
please?
So how was the party?
You drugged me.
Oh. Just a little.
What is wrong with you?
I told you,
i didn't want any pot.
Before you slap me around,
let me ask you something.
Do you feel better?
That's not the point.
And what were you thinking,
using my son as a drug mule?
He didn't know
what was going on,
And why are you making
such a big deal about it?
Let me ask you something.
Do you remember what I wore
to the junior prom
Or what part I had
in the play that year?
Who remembers that stuff?
Parents who weren't stoned.
My whole childhood
passed in a blur
Because you were
medicating yourself...
pot when you were sick,
booze when you weren't.
I am not going to do that.
I won't miss a second
of my kids' lives,
Not if I can avoid it.
Well, I'd say I'm sorry,
but I'm not.
You're a mom. You know,
There's nothing worse than
watching your kids suffer,
And seeing you...
act all goofy,
Watching that cartoon,
well...
it was probably
the high point of my trip.
I get it.
But if you ever pull
something like this again...
i won't.
Okay. Well...
i think I'll turn in.
Yenta.
What?
Junior year, you were yenta
in "fiddler on the roof."
You remembered.
Yeah. There are
some performances so bad,
Even alcohol
can't block them out.
Bree?
Can we call a truce,
please?
So you know
I'm not bluffing, um,
I brought cake.
I am so sorry that
i snapped at you tonight.
It's okay.
I just wanna know
what's going on.
Ever since
you've been pregnant,
There's been this wall
between us.
It's like something's changed,
and I don't know why.
Did I do something
to offend you?
It's not about you.
I've just been
going through some things.
Like what? I mean,
come on. Just tell me.
We share everything.
Okay. Um...
i haven't told anybody this,
but...
it's, uh, about the baby.
There have been
some complications.
Oh, no.
Is everything okay?
Yeah, everything's fine,
but, uh,
There was just a time where
i thought I might lose it.
Oh, my god.
And there I was,
Just bugging you
about your doctor.
I am so sorry.
You should've just told me.
No, you're pregnant, too.
I'm not gonna tell you anything
that's gonna worry you.
Oh, are you kidding?
It's the first baby I've had
in 17 years.
You know, I could not possibly
be more freaked out. Mm.
This morning,
i caught mike building a crib.
No. This early?
Yeah! I-I wanted to scream.
You know, are you nuts?
Do you just wanna jinx it?
This is what we get
for having kids at our age...
anxiety, terror.
It's just gonna get worse.
Do you know, when our babies
go to college,
We'll be like...
dead?
if we're lucky.
Look at us.
Pregnant gals, eating cake
and bitchin'.
It's kinda nice, huh?
It really is.
What are you doing?
The hospital called.
My aunt's ready to come home.
And you want her
to stay in here?
Yeah. I think making this room
off-Limits was a mistake.
If I want dylan
to focus on other things,
I really need to make it
less intriguing.
Speaking of intriguing,
What were you thinking
last night?
What?
Come on. "The worst thing
a father could do"?
You realize what people
are gonna think.
Yeah. They're gonna be
very uncomfortable,
And uncomfortable people
don't ask questions.
All children love games.
But children grow up,
And then they find
new games to play.
They pretend to be well
so their families won't worry.
They lie to their lovers
About where they go
in the afternoon.
So anyway, that's why
it was so great. Oh!
They invent stories to hide
the truth from their friends.
I got it, I got it.
Oh, one more. Here you go.
Yes...
Everyone has fun playin' games
Right up until the moment...
...someone gets hurt.
Previously on Desperate Housewives...
When her first husband died,
Bree thought she was
rid of her mother-in-law...
Danielle got pregnant,
and Bree got creative...
Soon this whole charade
will completely unravel
and we will be humiliated.
Carlos and Gaby's affair
turned dangerous...
If she pulled something
like that on me,
that guy wouldn't
be around for long.
And an old neighbor returned...
I didn't want poor Aunt Lily to spend
her final days in a nursing home.
That is so kind of you.
Mrs. Lillian Sims returned
to Wisteria Lane on a Saturday...
As she emerged from the ambulance...
it occurred to her...
the neighborhood looked
exactly as she had left it...
She then decided...
she should have painted
her house blue...
Moments later...
she wondered if she would
see her husband in Heaven...
These are just some
of the thoughts...
that go through
an old woman's mind...
when she comes home, to die.
Now if you need anything,
you just ring this little bell,
and I'll come running.
I'm sorry to be so much trouble.
Well, the good news is
I won't be a burden much longer.
Oh, don't say that...
The doctors say there's
a good chance
that you'll be with us
for a very long time.
I know what's happening
to me, Katherine.
You don't need to lie...
Aunt Lily...
What does it feel like?
Dying...?
I mean...
It's not that bad.
I feel lucky.
When you know time is running out,
you get a chance
to reflect on your life.
I really did try to live a good one.
You did more than try.
God is going to welcome
you with open arms.
I'm not so sure...
Oh, why would you say that?
I keep thinking about Dylan...
What we did, what we covered up.
We did what we had to.
We should have told someone.
We couldn't.
You know that.
It... It was a mistake.
And it's not too late to rectify it.
Your life may be over.
But that does not
give you the right
to go around destroying
the lives of others.
I can't go to my grave with
this on my conscience.
Please! We have to tell that girl
what happened in this room.
Absolutely not!
As her guilt over the
past began to mount...
it occurred to Lillian...
death couldn't come quickly enough...
This thought occurred
to her niece as well.

There were a lot of things
Bob Hunter disliked
about living in the city...
And the thing he hated most...
were the pests.
The rats that lurked in the alleys...
The flies that swarmed the garbage...
The bugs that invaded his co-op...
I have tried it your way...
Finally, Bob informed
his significant other
it was time...
to leave the city.
So...
they moved to suburbia...
Which they quickly
discovered had a few pests...
Hey, neighbor!
Of its own...
Oh, we haven't gotten
a chance to meet.
I'm Susan, I live next door. Oh! jeez...
Hi. Hi, I'm Lee.
I... I just wanted to say hi.
You know, I saw the movers taking in
some of your furniture
and I just have to say
you and your wife
have gorgeous taste.
Need some help?
Yeah, like you wouldn't believe.
I'm Susan. I live next door.
Oh, hi. I'm Lee's partner, Bob.
Oh, you're partners!
What kind of business?
You know, whatever it is
just don't let the
neighborhood association
hear that you work
out of your house.
They're so not cool.
Actually...
we're life partners.
Oh, that's super!
Yeah, I've seen a lot
of cable, so I get it.
You're just great.
Thank you. I hope we can live
up to your stereotype.
Don't mind him!
He's just a little cranky
from... all the fresh air.
Do not apologize for me.
Lee, you're the one who said moving
here would be better for Raphael.
So there's...
there's three of you.
Well, that must be...
cozy...
Yes. We're gay mormons.
Susan...
That's Raphael!
Raphael is your dog, of course.
You know, 'cause you
folks can't have kids.
I mean...
of course you can have kids...
You... You know, because
times have changed
and now you're allowed.
What a...
nice dog...
I should go.
Nice to meet you.
Hey, stop by any time, Susan...
What are you doing?
Yes?
I have a delivery for
Danielle Van De Kamp.
Can I get you to sign here, please?
Is that for us?
No, it's for Danielle.
That's odd.
Who would send her a scooter?
I knew it! Phyllis. Rex's mother.
Ever since he died
she's been trying to buy
the children's affection.
Well, it's a honey of a bike.
I'm sure Danielle will
appreciate the thought.
Well, I'm not giving it to her.
Can you think of a worse
present for a pregnant girl?
Well, I'm not knocked up.
Let me have it.
You know how I feel about
two-wheeled motorized vehicles.
They're too dangerous!
We'll donate it to the church.
What?!
Reverend Sikes said they're
looking for items for the raffle.
So we're just gonna give it away?
Well, it's better than you
breaking your neck on it.
Mom, you know how much
I want a scooter. Come on!
You heard your mother.
We're donating it to the church.
Of course, we need to make
sure it's in good working order
before we do that.
Not without a helmet!
This blows.
Are we gonna let her do this to us?
Absolutely not.
If we win that raffle,
we're keeping it.
Hey.
It is nice to hear
you humming again.
Well, it's amazing what a
week without chemo can do.
Yeah. When does the last round start?
Next month, so I have some time
before I start feeling
like total crap again.
And I was hoping we could
put that time to good use.
Are you sure...?
I mean, the doctor said
it could be months before
you get your mojo back.
Well, it's back!
And since when do
you question the mojo?
You're right.
You're right, forgive me.
Okay.
So here are your options.
A: we could go romantic,
play soft music, light some candles.
Or B: go straight to the...
God, it's so been so long.
I hope I remember how to do this.
Well, it's just like riding
a bike, you never forget.
Now start pedaling.
Hey. What are you doing?
Oh, sorry. I just messed up your hair.
I'm just trying to fix it.
Sorry. Almost got it.
Hey!
Screw it.
What, what are you doing?
Oh, I ripped it this morning.
It's been itching the hell out of me...
And this is much better.
Are you sure you wanna
take that off, honey? I mean...
won't you be cold?
No, I'm good...
Hey, baby, what's going on,
are you still with me?
Yeah...
It's just, it's...
kinda...
What?
Late?
It's nine thirty!
It's just one of our
ovens broke down
and the guy from the reparance
coming first thing in the morning.
Maybe I could ravish you...
tomorrow.
Come on, Bree!
You have to let us do this.
It's a lovely thought,
but I really don't
want a baby shower.
Well, I bought you
an expensive gift
and I'm not giving it to
you unless there's a party
with people who can
see how generous I am.
Bree, watch this!
Orson, I said be careful!
I just think it's tacky
to have a baby shower
when it's not your first baby.
Well, I don't see the problem
with it... Hint, hint.
Yeah, and showers aren't just
about presents. They're fun.
And we can play games, like
"How big is mummy's tummy?"
Excuse me?
Yeah, we get a ball of yarn,
and we each cut a piece
that we think is just big enough
to fit around your stomach
and the one closest wins a prize.
I really don't want a shower.
Look! Look at me!
Orson, just five more minutes!
That's all you're getting!
I tell you what. Why don't
we just skip the shower
and after the baby's born,
I'll have a christening party?
What do you say?
I'm okay!
I'm fine.
Oh, dear God.
Excuse me, ladies.
I... I couldn't help overhearing
you talking about my mom's shower.
I think I could be of a
little assistance here.
Why do you have to take our
new neighbors cookie bars?
Oh, look, I made a terrible
first impression
so I thought I'd make them some
of my home-baked goodness.
But you didn't bake any goodness.
You just warmed up the goodness
I bought at the store.
Well, yeah, I don't bake. Catch up!
You know, not all neighbors
have to be friends.
Why don't you just let it go?
Mike, they live 15 feet from us.
If we have a fire, I wanna be sure
that they like us enough to call 911.
Ah, that's the real reason.
You can't stand it when
somebody doesn't like you.
Well, maybe.
Well, maybe Bob and Lee just
like to keep to themselves.
That's fine,
and once they like me,
they can keep to themselves
all they damn well please.
Hi. I wanted to bring you
a "Welcome to
the Neighborhood" present.
You should try one while
they're still warm from the oven.
That's really nice, thank you.
Oh, are there nuts in them?
Nuts?
Yeah.
Gee, let me think...
Nope, no nuts!
Are you sure?
Cause I'm highly allergic.
Half a pecan could kill me.
I'm not seeing any nuts.
Okay, you made them?
So did you or did you
not put nuts in them?
Okay, here's the thing.
I'm a really crappy baker.
To give you something
that I made myself
would be like an insult, so...
So, so, so you bought them!
And then you heated them up
in attempt to make your gesture
seem more thoughtful
than in fact it was?
Hey, I would've made
them myself if I knew how!
Honestly, I'm a good neighbor.
Yeah, well, neighbor,
why don't you take
your store-bought, warmed-up,
possibly poisonous cookie bars
and give them to someone more
likely to survive your generosity?
Do you like wine?
No, no, so please don't bring
me a bottle from your vineyard.
This rip is pretty big!
It'll take about a week.
A week!?
All right.
You'll hurry if you can?
Honey, it's okay.
You look cute in a scarf.
I'm upset cause that salesgirl
just walked away
with my sex life.
What?
After two months
of puking my guts out,
last night I was
finally in the mood
but Tom, not so much.
Apparently, my bald head
is a big turnoff for him...
Why'd you take your wig off?
It was itchy.
Okay...
not smart.
Gaby, I am his wife.
He's supposed to love me!
Not my body, me!
My... My soul.
Why can't he make love to my soul?
Interesting...
Question?
When was the last
time you were in the bar
and heard a guy turn
to his friend and say
"Hey, check out
the soul on that girl?"
What are you saying?
I'm saying men are visual.
Hell, I have a whole
closet full of costumes.
You need to give Tom
something to look at.
Something...
spicy like...
Gaby, I'm not a redhead.
But you could be!
Which brings me to
my second point...
Men like variety.
Tonight you're a redhead...
tomorrow...
you are Helga, the sexy milkmaid.
Or...
Amber, the lonely runaway.
Or...
Jeff, the friendly guy from work.
What? I don't know
what Tom is into.
Claude, you know
I don't like it when you "hmm"...
Edie...
How long have you had this?
Had what?
I don't have anything...
I'm just here for
my 5000 mile checkup.
Well, you know that bullet
you've managed to dodge
all these years?
Which one?
The clap? The herp?
The syph?!
Crabs?
Relax. I'll boil all the
sheets and towels.
And then we'll use
this special shampoo
and in three days...
the crotch carnival packs
up and leaves town.
Man!
How did this happen?
Don't give me that look.
I know exactly how I got 'em.
I used the tanning bed
right after Mimsy Porter,
that skank.
It smells like burnt licorice.
Well, come in the bathroom
and I'll show you how to use this.
I think I can figure that out.
You know, the good news is
we're in a committed relationship.
Otherwise, we'd have to
make that call of shame
to everyone we've been with.
You've heard me make before,
but something I feel
very, very strongly about.
For me, it's a very simple formula.
More development leads
to an increased tax base
which helps build schools
for our children.
Around the country, the needs
of children are being...
What are you doing here?
I need to talk to you.
Can't you just call me?
This is not something that
you wanna hear on the phone.
Where did you get those?
How do you think? Edie.
You are still sleeping with Edie?
Well, you're still sleeping
with Victor, aren't you?
Yeah, if I didn't, he would
think something is going on.
What is your excuse
for doing it with Edie?
She wants to, and I'm a guy.
This is serious, okay?
If Victor wakes up
with a zoo in his pants,
there's gonna be hell to pay.
You don't have to tell me.
If he finds out about us,
I'm the one that's gonna
wind up in a landfill.
Okay, just don't panic, okay?
We're gonna get the salve
or the ointment,
or whatever it is you put down
there, and we're gonna be fine.
We're screwed.
Yeah.
Tom?
The kids are asleep.
Are you coming to bed anytime soon?
Yeah, I just gotta pick
a new running back
for my fantasy football team.
That's too bad.
I had a little fantasy thing
planned of my own.
Lynette...
Lynette's not here right now.
I'm Brandy, the slutty cheerleader.
This is all very romantic, Gaby.
But I still have four building
proposals to read before tomorrow.
That's Nurse Gaby to you.
Nurse Gaby?
Am I sick?
Well, the doctor says
you need to relax.
And I know just
how to relax you.
It smells like licorice.
It's a blend of 36 essential oils,
anise root and fennel.
Do you like it?
It smells a little mediciny.
That's the fennel.
It's stinging a little.
That's, the tension...
leaving your body.
It's really stinging.
And we can rinse it off...
in three to five minutes...
but before we do that...
What the hell is that?
You know, for a guy getting
rubbed down by a hot nurse,
you ask a lot of questions.
Sorry.
Oh, come on, uncle Frank.
What's the point of
having a gay uncle
if you're not gonna help me
make friends with these guys?
Mom said that the
whole family knew.
Okay, gotta go. Love you.
What's going on?
Oh, I found Raphael
wandering in the street.
I went to take him back,
but Bob and Lee aren't home
so I'm just gonna give him a little
treat and put him back in their yard.
Wait a second!
Leave him with me.
I need to score some
points with those guys
and being a dog-rescuing
hero could be just the ticket.
So what, you're just gonna keep
him here until they come back?
Maybe a little longer...
How long?
Well, long enough
for them to worry.
You know, the more they worry,
the more I'm a hero. Get it?
I get that you're insane.
I'm not, I'm not.
Now get some mud.
I wanna dirty him up so
he looks like he's been through hell.
Okay, in you go.
Here, let me help you with those.
Oh, that's all right.
I've got them, Mr. Knievel.
Oh, boy. You're never gonna
let me live this down, are you?
Nope.
I thought the same thing. It seems to me
that you should go to the doctor again.
Surprise!
Guys...
What did I tell you?
You said "no shower".
But look around! Men.
So technically, it's a party,
not a shower.
Andrew told us that
you only said no
cause you didn't want to impose.
So you're responsible?
Yeah, well, I know you said
not to make a big fuss,
but hey!
You earned it.
Well, don't just
stand there, come in.
We have lots of food
and fun and surprises.
Yeah, all kinds of surprises...
Where is she?
Bree!
Phyllis!?
I... helped with the invitations, too.
I can't tell you how
touched I was to be included.
Especially after my
many conciliatory gestures
were so coldly rebuffed.
I have been awful.
I wouldn't blame you if
you stormed out right now.
Nonsense.
I'm here to celebrate
our renewed friendship...
and your baby.
Or should I say babies?
You know, it's often a sign of twins
when a mother's face
gets all plump like yours.
I...
bet you wouldn't mind if I broke
my neck on that scooter now.
I'm off to the bank.
Aunt Lily just took a pill,
so she's down for the afternoon.
Okay. Have fun.
Is your mother gone?
Yeah, do you need her?
No, no...
This is what I wanted...
I thought you took a sleeping pill.
I pretended to so
she'd leave us alone...
Aunt Lily, what's going on?
I have to tell you something...
First, you should know
that what happened...
it was nobody's fault.
What do you mean,
what happened?
You don't remember
living on this street before...
do you?
No.
Well...
there's a reason for that...
Dylan?
Mom, I thought you left?
I forgot my checkbook.
Could you go down
and find it for me?
Sure.
You really should get your rest.
Hey!
Hey.
Got your wig back, huh?
Yeah, good as new!
Listen...
I thought we could put
the kids to bed early tonight,
if you know what I mean...
I do... and I'm up for that.
Fantastic.
I hope Brandy
won't get stuck late
at cheerleading practice?
About Brandy...
bad news.
What? What happened?
Well, Penny wanted to play
beauty school with the wig
and, well...
let's just say she's got
no future as a stylist.
Bad haircut, huh?
Sounds like Brandy might
get awful mad about that.
Brandy's history, Tom.
Let her go.
Raphael!
Come home, boy!
Raphael?
Lee?
Is something wrong?
Raphael got out.
I don't know what happened.
I think he jumped the fence.
Well...
would you like me to
help you look for him?
Seriously?
What a... What about your party?
It's just a baby shower...
that I'm throwing...
for my best friend.
I can't ask you to leave that.
Oh, please.
What are neighbors for?
Raphael?
Here, puppy!
I see you've taken down
all the pictures of Rex.
Well, I'm... sorry if that
offends you, Phyllis,
but I didn't want Orson to feel
uncomfortable in his new home.
I see...
you're trying to be considerate
of your husband's feelings.
Well, I'm glad that you're at least trying
to get it right the second time around.
Still, it must be awfully
hard on Danielle and Andrew
to have their father's face
banished from their own home.
He wasn't banished!
By the way...
Where...
Where's Danielle?
She's... at boarding school...
in Switzerland.
Switzerland?!
Is it asking too much to be told what
continent my granddaughter is on?!
You are keeping
my grandchildren from me
and I don't know why!
I'm going to mingle.
Every time I start a chat,
you walk away.
I mean, if you don't
want to talk to me,
why did you invite me?
It's a surprise party,
you daft woman!
What makes you think
I had a hand in the guest list?
So...
you don't want me here?
For God sakes, Phyllis.
It's not as if we got along
when Rex was alive.
What did I ever do to you?
But try to treat you
like a daughter...
I even gave you
my mother's sable coat.
You hated your mother!
But I loved that coat!
Then I'll give it back to you.
No, you keep it
as a reminder
of how hard I tried
to make you like me.
Grandma, are you leaving already?
I'm sorry, dear.
But your mother has made
it impossible for me to stay.
Where does she keep my sable coat?
Probably in her bedroom closet.
Where is she going?
She asked me where
your fur coat was.
And you told her?!
Oh, crap!
I guess you won't be needing
the breast pump I bought you.
So...
Danielle is having a baby.
Yes, and for the sake
of her reputation
we've agreed to pretend
that it's mine.
I just hope that
those Swiss doctors know
what they're doing.
She's not in Switzerland.
She's at the Sisters of Hope convent.
Look, Phyllis, I'm sorry.
I know this is upsetting.
Actually, I'm thrilled.
I'm going to be a great-grandma!
Well, um...
technically, yes.
What do you mean, technically?
We're saying that the
baby is mine and Orson's
and if you hover around
like a grandmother,
people will be suspicious.
You're not keeping
this baby from me,
not if you don't want me to
tell those people downstairs
whose child it really is.
You wouldn't...
Think of Danielle!
I wish you had.
If you'd raised her properly,
she wouldn't be pregnant
without a husband!
You think I don't know
I'm a failure as a parent?
That's why this child
means so much to me.
It's my second chance.
Well, I hope the second time
around that you take my advice.
I always said that you were
too strict with those kids.
Parenting tips from you?
That's rich.
I was a wonderful mother to Rex!
Then why did he go and avoid you?
Why were you barely ever here?
Because of you!
He knew you hated me.
Oh, he was happy
to let you think that...
but he was the one
who dreaded your visits.
Phyllis, wait!
Excuse me, everyone,
but I have something to say.
What is it, grandma?
I...
I have to go.
And I just wanted
to say how nice it was
to see you all again
after so much time.
Good-bye.
Thank you for the gift.
You know, Bree,
you're not the only one who
would like a second chance.
Nothing, huh?
No. No, he's lost.
And he doesn't know
this neighborhood.
There's no way he's
gonna find his way home.
Oh, he will, come on,
you gotta keep believing.
Oh, crap!
Bob's home,
what am I gonna tell him?
Don't!
We'll just keep looking.
I have a feeling we're gonna
find that cute little guy.
You are so nice to do this!
I mean, especially after the
way I acted when we first...
You know what?
Don't worry about it.
I'm gonna go inside and
get us some water,
and then we're gonna
just keep looking.
Okay.
Lee!
I can't find Raphael, you
seen him anywhere?
Oh, Bob...
Prom... Promise you won't hate me.
What are you talking about?
What happened?
Raphael got out.
He got out?
Yeah.
He doesn't know the neighborhood.
I know he doesn't know
the neighborhood.
Oh, wait, he's right there.
Oh! Oh, my God!
What was our dog
doing in your garage?
I have no idea.
What?
Did you get a chance to
napalm the jungle yet?
Yep!
And?
All quiet on the southern front.
Gaby, we have got
to be more careful.
Absolutely.
It's kind of exciting, though.
What is?
Playing with fire, almost
getting burned but not quite.
Don't be thinking like that.
If Victor catches us,
he'll kill us both.
That's what's so exciting.
Hi.
Hi.
Oh, my... Excuse me.
Mmm, that's...
an interesting cologne
you're wearing...
My wife gave it to me.
It's got... anise root, fennel...
What, you like it?
Yeah, it's just...
I don't know...
weirdly familiar.
Crab cake?
Yeah.
Thanks.
Crab cake?
Crab cake?
Crab cake?
Kids are asleep.
I'm... not.
Whatcha got back there?
Just a little present.
Say hello to Brandy's
even sluttier sister...
Candy.
What are you doing?
Well, I just... I just thought
since we had
so much fun last night,
maybe we can have
a little more fun.
And that's only possible
when you're pretending
I'm someone else?
Well, you have to pretend, too!
What?
This...
is me, Tom!
Not...
Brandy or Candy...
It's just your wife...
Lynette, am I not enough for you?
What are you getting so mad for?
The first wig was your idea.
Yeah, because I'm bald.
And I know that
that's a big old turnoff
but, you know, I can't help it.
I have cancer.
Yes, I know.
I hear about it all the time.
Can you blame me for wanting
to escape every once in a while?
Escape from me, you mean?
Yes!
You know why last night
was so much fun?
Because I got to make love
to someone who wasn't sick.
I know, I know, I'm not
supposed to say this stuff.
I have to be the heroic
husband who listens
and holds you when you cry
and never cries himself.
But this affects me, too.
Well, I know that.
You do?
Yeah!
How?
Since this whole thing began,
have you ever once
asked me how I'm doing?
Oh...
My God!
I haven't...
Have I?
I am one of those...
whiny...
self-involved sick people.
I didn't say that...
No, I am.
It's been months and I have barely
thought about what you're going through.
It's okay.
Will you stop being so heroic?!
I'm a cancer bitch!
What?
I'm not gonna argue with you...
You suck.
Well...
I guess I could give Candy a whirl.
Are the kids really asleep?
Cause I think she might
be a screamer.
Actually...
if we're gonna pretend...
how about tonight
I'm not a hero...
and you are not
a cancer patient...?
We'll just be...
Tom and Lynette...
See what happens...
Oh, I'd like that.
How's Bob's suit?
Ruined.
What if we take it to my cleaners?
Susan, that paint's not coming out.
So we're buying him a new suit...
for 2000 bucks.
2000 $?
Well, according to Lee, it's a Dolce.
I don't know what that means,
but he said it six times.
That's crazy!
No, what's crazy is
I'm about to buy
the most expensive suit of my life
and I'll never wear it.
Oh. I just wanted them to like me.
Well, they don't.
Lee said that six times, too.
There must be some way
I can apologize to them.
We can't afford any
more of your apologies.
I know, maybe if I...
Damn it, Susan, let it go, okay?
I asked you to before, and you
didn't, and look what happened.
So I'll ask you again.
Just let it go.
Mike, wait, we should talk about this.
I'm going to bed.
I've gotta work tomorrow.
I'm buying a suit.
Grandma!
What are you doing here?
You needn't be embarrassed, dear.
Your mother's told me everything.
It's great to see you.
I hate this place.
It's like baby jail.
Well, that's what I've
come to talk to you about.
Perhaps it's time for you to leave.
Dylan?
Is that you?
We have...
Have to talk...
Hey!
I'm glad you're home.
I wanted to talk to you
about Aunt Lily.
What about her?
It was so weird.
She called me into
her room this afternoon.
She started saying she knew why
I didn't remember living
on this street before.
Oh, sweetie...
your Aunt Lily is fading fast.
Half the time, she doesn't
know what she's saying.
Was that her?
No, I just checked on her.
She's sleeping.
You know, you have that
recital in two weeks.
Shouldn't you be practicing?
Dylan...
Please...
Pests...
They come in all shapes and sizes...
And disrupt our lives
in a variety of ways...
At first, they're merely annoying...
And we do our best to ignore them...
Home in my own bed...
But if we don't take them seriously...
They can become quite dangerous...
For some...
death seems to be
the easiest solution...
But the problem with pests...
is that what they leave behind...
is just as dangerous.
Previously on Desperate Housewives
Gabrielle tried to
rekindle an old affair.
Gaby, i'm getting married.
And i was married when we got together.
That is not how i'm gonna be married.
Lynette got the support she
needed for chemotherapy.
Katherine, who liked
everything in its place... Ooh!
Thought that her husband
was forgetting his.
Oh, i guess you learned
nothing from chicago.
Bree's attempt to keep
Her daughter's pregnancy a secret...
You are keeping my
grandchildren from me.
Evoked an unexpected response.
We're life partners.
And Susan tried to connect
with the newest neighbors.
Yeah, i've seen a lot of cable,
so i get it.
I hope we can live up
to your stereotype.
I should go.
The odd-looking boxes
Were delivered to the home of
Bob Hunter and Lee Mcdermott
Early on a tuesday morning.
It wasn't long before
workmen had opened them
And begun assembling the
various parts and pieces.
Happily, it only took three hours
To turn the contents into
a finished work of art.
Sadly, it only took 15 minutes
For the residents of Wisteria Lane ...
What the hell is it?
To become art critics.
I think it's a sculpture.
I think it's crap.
Of all the gay men in the world,
We have to get the two without taste.
What are we gonna do about this?
I say we keep smiling and
look for the hidden cameras.
I think we're about to get punk'd.
I don't think there's anything
we can do. It's not our lawn.
It's our neighborhood,
And we have rules against
this sort of thing,
Or at least we did when
i used to live here.
Who's running the
homeowners association?
Well, it was mary alice,
but as you may have heard...
Yes, very tragic. So we haven't
had a president in four years?
No one would volunteer.
It's a pain-in-the-ass job.
I'll volunteer.
We can hold an election in
the next couple of days.
I can get rid of this tinfoil
atrocity by the weekend.
Okay, before we become an ugly mob,
Why doesn't one of us
go talk to the guys?
But not me. They hate me.
Bree, you talk to them.
You can relate to them.
Why would you say that?
You got a kid who came
flying out of the closet
And a husband who's been
looking for the doorknob.
What? You've met him.
Ooh! They're coming.
Good morning, ladies.
Hi. Uh, we were just talking
about your sculpture.
That's what i love about art--
The way it provokes discussion.
Although it would've been nice
If you had discussed it with us.
What, you don't- you don't like it?
Well, we're not saying that.
It's just a little, uh...
It's an eyesore.
Really? Mm-hmm.
You hear that, Bob?
We flew to finland
And paid $24,000 to
commission an eyesore.
I don't mind it.
Not to brag, but i went to art school.
Community college.
And they taught us
that art is subjective.
Thank you, Susan.
Susan's need for approval aside,
This clearly is not
appropriate for the street.
Wisteria lane has a...
Traditional look.
Well, maybe you'd like it better
If we covered it with a gingham throw.
Ladies, uh, i'm sorry.
We honestly thought that
people would like it,
But even if you disapprove,
we hope that you will respect
Our right to decorate as we see fit.
Have a nice day, philistines.
Yes, art came to Wisteria
Lane on a tuesday morning,
And by tuesday afternoon...
I think it's time to reconvene
the homeowners' association.
All in favor?
Aye.
War had come as well.
As word of the sculpture spread,
Bob and Lee began to wonder
If any of their neighbors
would be supportive.
But when the sculpture's true function
Was unveiled the next day,
Whatever support they did have...
Was quickly washed away.
Come on.
It's 6:00 a.m. What is that?
I don't know,
but make it stop.
Oh, my god.
Wow! It's a fountain, too.
We would have mentioned that yesterday,
But your friends were a little uptight.
Yeah, they can get like that.
So do you think that you can
just turn it off for a second?
What's up?
I was just wondering, um,
Do you think you could
move it to your backyard?
Why? I thought you liked it.
Remember? You said,
"art is subjective."
Yes. Quiet art is subjective
But you see, Mike is working
really long hours lately,
And he can't s Lee p
with all that noise.
We're not gonna turn it off
because we need it to drown out
All the stuff we hear coming
from your house. Like what?
Let's see.
You yakking to your mom on the phone.
You grunting through your pilates dvds.
You in the shower,
butchering the score to "brigadoon."
I have a lovely voice.
Whoever told you that
is not your friend.
He's a little cranky.
I think someone needs his french toast.
Come on, Lee.
No, no, no, no. No, no,
we're not done here.
As your neighbor,
i have a right to be heard...
And i say that simple human decency
Dictates that you turn off
that fountain right now!
Do over, Parker.
Hey, guys, i got your snack.
What you playing?
Action figures.
Wanna play, mom?
She does awesome alien voices.
Thanks, sweetheart.
Oh, yeah. Hi, dr. Shiller.
Okay, that's my white blood count.
Uh-huh, but as long as
it's higher than 4.0,
That means i don't have
neutropenia, right?
Well, that's great.
Thanks for calling.
Yeah, you, too. Bye.
What?
You can't talk about doctors up here.
Or about being sick.
If you do, you have to go.
That's the rule.
That's a good rule.
Although it wasn't bad news.
It was actually--
Doesn't Matt er.
We voted. It's a rule.
Got it.
Sick talk done, okay?
You guys have fun.
Freeze power.
Do over, Parker.
That guy doesn't have freezing power.
If his guy can fly,
my guy can freeze.
Hi. It's, uh, mrs. Hodge.
May i please speak with Danielle?
Muffins. T...
Hands off. We're bringing these
to Danielle for her birthday.
What do you mean, she's gone?
And you believed her?
You idiot!
I should sue your
irresponsible ass off for this.
Yeah, well, good day to you, too,
reverend mother!
What happened?
Those stupid nuns at the convent
Let Danielle 's grandmother kidnap her.
She claimed i'd given her
permission for a weekend visit.
Phyllis! It's me.
You can screen your
calls all you want to,
But trust me, old woman,
you are in a world of trouble.
I know where you live,
and i am coming for you.
Shouldn't we be worried?
No, i think we're ready for her.
Now show me again how
you kill the zombies.
Why can't i go? I play golf.
And i'd love to meet your...
College buddies.
Edie, me and the guys have only
two rules for these weekends--
No plaid pants and no women.
Fine. Be that way.
And to think,
i got you a gift.
Hey, golf balls.
They're monogrammed.
Wait. These are your initials.
Exactly.
While you're out there playing,
I want everyone to know
who your balls belong to.
Good work, boys,
but i have to head out in a few minutes,
So make sure you put all the
stuff back in the garage.
Hello?
Hey, on my way.
Meet you at the hotel, okay?
I'm leaving in five minutes.
Uh, Brett,
could you come here a second?
How long has that van been
parked over there? Couple hours.
Hours? Are you serious?
Oh, my god. I think he's just
waiting for someone to come home.
Brett, when's the last time a
cable guy waited for anyone?
I see a lot of lawn
mowing in your future.
Hey, it's me again.
You're not gonna believe this.
Before Victor left on his business trip,
He hired someone to tail me.
Oh, man.
Should we call this off? No way.
It's gonna take more than
a guy with mini binoculars
And a bag of doughnuts to
keep me under lock and key.
I'll be there as soon as i can.
Boys, time to get paid.
Come on, Eddie!
Bye, mrs. Lang.
See you next time.
Come back here!
Are you taking the bus home?
As soon as we get around the corner,
We're gonna have to adjust this horn.
Gabrielle.
Hey.
H-hi.
Look at you. What a surprise.
Oh, uh, this is Gaby.
This is my wife Tammy.
Tammy, this is Gabrielle.
Wow, look at you.
Congratulations.
Thanks. It wasn't planned.
Okay.
So... Are you guys staying here?
No, we just came for some lunch.
Daddy owns this place.
That's right.
You're a hotel heiress.
Yeah, but not one of the skanky ones.
How do you two know each other?
I used to be Gabrielle 's gardener.
Oh! Well, as you can see,
He's certainly married up from lawn boy.
Tammy. What?
Forget it.
So i heard you married the mayor.
You're married to Victor lang?
He and daddy go hunting together.
I told John if he would
just be nicer to daddy,
He could hang out with
people like the mayor
And make important contacts.
And i keep telling you that i don't need
To kiss your father's
ass to have a career.
Uh, yeah,
so i married the mayor.
Kooky, huh?
So, um, is he here with you?
Uh, no.
He's away at a conference,
So i decided to treat
myself to a spa weekend.
Ooh! You should definitely
get the full body massage.
Oh, i plan to.
Good to see you.
You, too, Gaby.
Sorry about that.
A complete shock.
I mean,
of all people to run into.
Who were they?
Just an old friend and his idiot wife.
Come on. Let's go.
Bree, how lovely to see you.
Cram it, Phyllis.
You got a lot of nerve
Stealing Danielle from a
convent we prepaid for.
She didn't steal me.
I'm a mature person capable
of making my own decisions.
Well, good.
You can decide to pack,
Because we are taking
you back to the convent.
Mnh-mnh.
I'm turning 18 this weekend,
So you can't boss me around anymore.
I'm staying with grandma,
And i'm gonna have my
baby delivered here.
We have an excellent medical staff.
It's a retirement village.
All these doctors know how
to deliver is bad news.
I don't care. I'm staying,
And i'm gonna raise the
baby here, too. What?
Entirely her idea.
A baby is god's most precious gift.
I will not have mine raised
By a cold,
emotionally unavailable woman like you.
"Emotionally unavailable."
Gosh, i wonder where she picked
up that little phrase. Hmm.
Like i'm too dumb to think of it myself?
You're always mean to me,
just like you were to dad.
You emasculated him.
Well, you're not gonna emasculate me.
You don't even know what that means,
You petulant sock puppet!
Who cares?
I'm going to the store.
Buy a dictionary.
So that's all settled.
Would you like some iced tea?
You aren't joining the lynch mob?
Uh, you mean Katherine
's homeowners thing?
Yeah, i think i'll sit this one out.
No, no, no. You can't do that.
You've got to pick a side.
Art or mindless conformity?
See, this is one of the
upsides of having cancer.
You get to excuse yourself from
petty neighborhood squabbles.
You won't think they're so
petty when she comes after you.
Me? Why would she do that?
Did the homeowners' association
approve everything in your yard?
The fence? That swing?
The tree house?
I don't think Katherine
will bother herself
Over a tree house.
First, they came for the fountains,
And i did not speak out because
i had no fountain. What?
Then they came for the lawn gnomes,
And i did not speak out
because i had no gnome.
You're comparing Katherine to a nazi?
Then they came for my tree house,
And there was no one
left to speak out for me.
Thank you, ladies.
I so appreciate your input,
And i think we can all agree
That the fountain has
no place on our street.
Yeah, we gotta show those
gays we mean business.
Ida, again,
the issue is not Bob and Lee being gay.
It's the fountain.
Well, can't it be both?
Anyway...
If you elect me president,
my first act
Will be to eliminate this
so-called work of art.
Hear, hear.
Yes, Lynette.
After you get rid of this fountain,
that's it, right?
I don't follow.
I mean...
You're not gonna start
Checking everyone's yards
for things that don't fit in?
Oh, of course not.
As long as those things meet
the association's guidelines.
Uh-huh.
And what if they don't?
Are you referring to
something in particular?
My kids' tree house.
Can you promise you'll leave it alone?
Well, it's not up to me.
That's the whole point.
There are rules.
That sounds like a no.
If i make an exception for you,
Then i have to make one for everyone,
And surely,
you realize that the whole neighborhood
Can't revolve around
your little tree house.
Now since i am running unopposed,
I just need someone to
second my nomination.
Oh! Thank you, Lynette.
No, actually,
i'm nominating myself.
I am now running for president...
Against you.
You know,
running for president in your condition?
I don't think it's a good idea.
Tom, i don't want your opinion,
just your vote.
If you want to save the tree house,
Why don't you let me run instead?
Because you'd never win.
Bossy women rule this street.
You know that.
I know one rules my life.
I'm sorry.
I didn't catch that.
Nothing.
Look, this is not just about
a tree house or a fountain.
This is about
What kind of neighborhood
we want to live in.
Do we get to make our own choices,
Or do we let the taste
police make them for us?
Ah, now i get it. This about you
wanting to take on Katherine.
No!
This is about personal freedom--
Specifically, my personal freedom
To take down that jackbooted hausfrau.
Honey, if you're looking
for something to fight,
How about your cancer?
Hey, a tumor is a tumor
Whether it's in your body
or living across the street.
I don't know why you buy those things.
They just end up on the floor.
Because i want to feel
pretty and feminine.
Ooh! My chili cheese fries!
Just a second!
Gabrielle? It's me- John.
John? John who?
Uh, okay.
You know that old friend
I ran into in the lobby?
It might have been John Rowland.
Maybe. I'm not sure.
Gabrielle?
But just to be safe,
you may wanna hide in the closet.
What? I'm not hiding from that guy.
Really?
Because his father-in-law
goes hunting with Victor --
You know,
the guy who hired someone
To tail us and possibly kill us?
Okay.
John, what are you doing here?
When i ran into you last fall,
You wanted to start up our affair again,
And i wasn't ready.
Well, i'm ready.
Listen, i promised Tom i
wouldn't knock myself out
Campaigning for this homeowners thing,
So i was hoping you could help me--
You know, ring some bells,
talk me up, that sort of thing?
I would love to, but...
But what?
This is awkward.
Uh, i told Katherine i'd vote for her.
You're picking her over me?
Uh, it's not like i'm pro Katherine.
I'm just anti-fountain.
Oh, don't give me that look.
I made her a promise.
Yes, but that was
before your best friend
Threw her scarf in the ring.
Okay. If i vote for you,
Do you promise to get
rid of that fountain?
See, that's awkward for me.
This is about personal freedom.
You know?
I'm running as a libertarian.
Well, i'm voting as a light s Lee per.
It's right outside our bedroom window.
Seriously, Lynette, it's like
living next to splash mountain.
But it's my kids' tree house.
They really need it. Well,
We need our s Lee p.
Why don't you get earplugs?
Why don't you get...
Tree house plugs?
What?
That doesn't even make sense.
Yeah, i'm sorry.
You know,
tired people aren't witty.
Seriously, John,
you have got to get out of here.
No. Please.
I need to be with you.
What about your wife? You met her.
She's dumb, demanding,
Totally self-centered,
especially in bed.
I mean, she's awful.
Awfully pregnant. I know.
I-i'm completely trapped,
Just like you were with mr. Solis.
I-i wasn't "trapped."
What do you mean?
All you'd ever talk about was
what a selfish pig he was.
Well, i think you're paraphrasing.
Okay, seriously,
you have to go.
Come on. You know it would be hot,
just like old times.
Remember how great our sex was?
Oh,
I don't think we need to get into that.
What about the time we were
doing it in the shower?
Mr. Solis drove up?
Uh, does not ring a bell.
Come on.
And i hid in the closet?
And you looked so hot,
mr. Solis pulled you down on the bed.
And you had to fake an orgasm
just so he wouldn't catch on.
Yeah, good times.
Anyways, uh,
that's a negatory on the affair... What?
And i will see you later.
Come on,
but we're so good together. Gab--
Please!
Boy, that was a close one, huh?
You faked it with me
While that wax job was
hiding in the closet?
Yes, i had an affair.
Old news. Move on.
Where's that room service?
So you're not gonna apologize
For humiliating me in my own bed?
You deserved it.
All you cared about back then was work.
Hey, i was not that bad of a husband,
And somebody had to support
your italian shoe addiction.
I shopped because i
was bored and lonely--
Same reason i had an affair.
Yeah, with our teenage gardener!
I should have snapped that
kid's neck two years ago.
Oh, let it go!
John Rowland didn't do anything to you
That you're not doing to Victor.
You can't even compare the two!
It's completely different!
Is it, mr. Man in the closet?
Yeah, you heard me.
Who's John Rowland now?
Katherine, what are you up to?
Just visiting a friend.
Liar. You're campaigning.
Cookies--nice touch.
Ditto on the scarf.
Edie, you got a moment?
I am running for president of
the homeowners' association,
And i want to talk to you
about that horrible fountain.
Screw the fountain.
You want my support?
Make Ida greenberg
ditch that screen door.
That rusty,
old tetanus bucket...
Looks fine to me.
It's hardly ripped at all.
In fact,
if you give me your support...
I'll make mrs. Burkette
prune those roses.
It's a garden, not a jungle,
And you shouldn't have to...
Pay for a fence you don't even want.
That's not how you make good neighbors,
And i don't care if...
The Mustafas don't celebrate christmas.
You're asking them to hang a few lights,
not convert.
When i'm president,
i promise...
You can keep that satellite dish.
In fact, this is practically
a first amendment issue.
The way i see it...
The entire neighborhood
Should be a testament
to symmetry and beauty.
So...
Have i got your vote?
Um, i'm not sure yet.
Keep rubbing.
Bree, i know you're upset,
but you've got to eat.
I'm just so mad at myself.
I should have realized
That the maternal instinct is so strong,
That even Danielle would develop it.
What's so funny?
You know those animals
who eat their young?
Even they have more maternal
instinct than Danielle.
Then why would she want the child?
You've known her how long,
and you still haven't
Figured out how that lentil
she calls a brain works?
There's no need to insult your sister.
Let him talk.
All right,
Danielle cares about three things--
Danielle, fun, and, uh...
Wait. I was wrong.
It's just two.
And a retirement village is fun?
Compared to what you're offering her--
A crappy job and community college.
I mean, you think grandma's
gonna make her do any of that?
So Danielle 's only doing this
Because Phyllis is
offering her a cushy life?
Yeah. If you want that baby,
You're gonna have to outbid grandma.
What are you doing here?
Hi, John.
I wanted to talk to you.
It'll be very friendly.
No hitting.
What's up?
This is gonna sound weird, but, uh,
I've been doing some
thinking lately, and, well,
I've decided that it's
time for me to forgive you.
For s Lee ping with my wife.
Yeah, well,
i didn't just s Lee p with Gaby.
I fell in love with her.
I forgive you for that, too.
Why are you doing this?
You in some kind of 12-step program?
Let's just say i've recently
learned how loving someone
Makes you forget the difference
between right and wrong.
Anyway, that's pretty much it.
I should go.
Do you still talk to Gabrielle?
Occasionally. Why?
I just want to know if she was happy.
I think she is.
Well...
Good for her.
All right, before we vote,
Are there any more questions
for the cand Ida tes?
Anybody besides Lee?
It's not a question.
I just want to remind everyone
That a vote for Katherine
is a vote for fascism.
What is it with you
gay people and clothes?
Fascism, Ida, not fashion.
Although if you ever do
want to talk fashion,
We're here for you.
All right, debate's over.
Let's kick this pig.
All in favor of Lynette?
Okay, and those for Katherine?
That's 14 for Lynette
and 14 for Katherine.
So what do we do? It's a tie.
No, it's not.
Susan voted twice.
Did i?
Well, that's obviously wrong.
You only get one vote,
sweet cheeks. Who's it gonna be?
Susan, we're waiting.
It's up to you, hon.
Katherine.
Okay, it's official.
Katherine is our new president.
Thank you.
Thank you, everyone,
And i promise to do my
best for this neighborhood.
And, Bob, Lee, mr. Mustafa,
I'll be in touch regarding
your various infractions.
And you, too, Lynette.
Meeting adjourned.
I know.
Well, i'm not surprised.
You know, Phyllis,
We cannot thank you enough
for accepting our apology.
Well, i think we should
try to stay on good terms
For Danielle 's sake.
I'm glad you suggested
that we eat out here.
I never think to do this.
Oh, darn,
i forgot the napkins.
Oh, no problem.
I'll go get some.
So now that we have a moment alone,
Your mother and i would like
to say how proud we are of you.
Yeah, right.
Seriously, we hadn't
realized you'd matured enough
To take on the burden of
motherhood all by yourself.
Well, grandma's gonna help.
She'll do what she can,
but you mustn't overtax her.
Her heart is not very strong.
She seems fine to me.
Well, knock wood.
We'd hate to see you forced
to take care of a baby
And a sick old woman.
Whoa! Mah-jongg.
Don't see that much anymore.
Danielle, you should introduce yourself.
These people are your new friends.
Mm.
And you're going to learn more
From their experience and wisdom
Than you ever could have learned
at that college in flor Ida.
Wait.
I thought i couldn't go there.
You said it was just a party school.
Well, actually,
we checked into the curriculum,
And it's very strong,
but no Matt er.
You're be happier here.
Yes, and with a grandmother's
unconditional love,
Who needs frat boys who only
like you for your convertible?
Whoa.
When did i get a convertible?
Well, we were gonna surprise
you with one for your birthday,
But since you're keeping the baby,
you'll want A more practical gift.
We're thinking a diaper service.
Oh, look,
they have water aerobics.
You should sign up.
You know,
maybe i should go to college.
I mean, for the baby's sake.
How can i support it without a degree?
But you can't raise this
child in a miami dorm room.
You'll need to leave it
with someone you can trust
To take care of it properly.
Sorry.
The elevator's out. I...
Oh. I have to catch my breath.
Grandma?
We need to talk.
What's this?
I thought we might toast my Victor y.
I'm kind of in the
middle of something here.
So... You haven't congratulated me yet.
I know.
Would you like to tell me
what's bothering youou?
I just want you to think about what
you've been doing for the past few days.
You've mounted a crusade against a
metal thing that shoots out water.
I'm trying to keep the
neighborhood beautiful.
I love this street.
Yeah, you keep saying that--
how happy you used to be here,
But ever since we've moved back,
All i've seen is an unhappy woman
Who needs to control everything.
We've both learned what
happens When you lose control.
Oh. Chicago again.
Tell you something
else we learned there.
When the chips are down,
it helps to have friends.
And you certainly haven't
made us any lately.
Congratulations.
Bye, grandma.
Good-bye, dear.
Tell your stepfather i'll be right out.
Oh, please, Phyllis.
Even you have to agree
That a girl who'd trade
her baby for a convertible
Isn't ready for motherhood.
She'd have changed once the baby came.
She's her father's daughter.
That's a nice picture of Rex.
Oh, i have a lot of pictures.
All of the women here do.
They're what we have left of the things
Time has taken from us...
Youth, homes and husbands...
And for the unluckiest, children.
I thought i was getting
back a part of Rex.
But now...
I know you're lonely, Phyllis,
But i can't give up this child
just to make you feel better.
You should go.
Your family's waiting for you.
Orson and i go to our club
almost every saturday night,
If you're...
Interested in babysitting.
You mean it?
How will you explain me to your friends?
I'll say that you're broke
and needed the money.
Can't you just say that
you like having me around?
I need something that will fly, Phyllis.
Hey. What's going on?
We need toalk.
So here's the deal.
I think it's time for us
to do the right thing.
I don't think i like
where this is going.
We have to end this affair.
You serious?
All this...
Sneaking around,
wearing disguises,
Hiding in closets- it's just wrong.
We're better than this.
So what are you suggesting,
we stay with Victor and Edie?
No, we break up with them.
Look, it'll hurt,
but at least it's honest.
And then when enough time has
gone by and they've moved on,
We can be together.
How long are we talking about?
I don't know. Six months?
Six months?
Nobody takes that long to heal anymore.
It's a breakup,
not a face-lift.
Hey, look,
i want us to be together, too,
But i also wanna feel good about it.
Don't you?
Yeah. I do.
You're such a good guy, Carlos.
I really hate that about you.
I know.
So... I guess this is it.
This kiss has to last six months.
You better make it good.
His guy can fly.
My guy freeze.
Hey, Lynette.
Hey, Judas.
Okay, fine.
You're still angry,
But i'm gonna make it up to you.
When they come after that tree house,
They're going to have one
Susan Mayer chained to it.
Don't do that.
I wanna be sad when they knock it down.
Lynette! What?
You think you can just walk over here
And cute your way out of what you did?
We're supposed to be friends.
Exactly, And friends don't put
friends in this kind of position.
I love you, but you can't ask me To
put your kids ahead of my husband.
No, Parker,
that guy doesn't have freezing...
You're right.
I shouldn't have done that.
But that tree house is the
one place my kids can go
And not hear about body scans
and white blood cell counts.
It is their getaway
from this horrible thing
That i've brought into the house.
"Brought"? Sweetie, it's not
your fault that you're sick.
I know that... Here.
But here...
It feels like i've
ruined their childhood.
Okay, if anybody needs me,
I'll be at the hardware
store buying chains.
Oh, jeez. Get over here.
Hello there!
Oh, look, it's our new
queen- Katherine of arrogant.
Hey, where's the wrecking ball?
Actually, i came to tell
you the tree house can stay.
Oh, my god. That's great!
Yes.
If anyone complains, we'll say
It was grandfathered in under
the previous administration.
Thanks. Why?
Clearly, it means a lot to you,
And i wanna be a good neighbor.
Katherine.
What's with you?
Sometimes you act like an ice queen,
And then you do something really nice.
You are one complicated lady.
Well, i've had one complicated life.
I've had a lot of men in my life,
But i never let myself
fall in love before.
I thought it was because i
didn't wanna get hurt, But...
Now i know the pain you feel
Isn't the worst part.
It's the hate.
Could you make it out to "cash"?
Hello, Katherine.
You here about the fountain?
Yes, but don't worry.
There's no strict deadline.
You can... Have it removed
at your earliest convenience.
Yeah, i don't think it's going anywhere.
Oh, boys, boys,
the war's over.
Yes, it is.
We know all about chicago.
Come again?
My ex is on the board of
chicago memorial hospital.
Seems your husband made
quite a stir there--
Whole hospital still
buzzing about what he did.
Whatever you heard is a vicious lie--
Every word of it.
Still, it was enough to...
Make you leave town,
Which begs the question,
do you like living here?
Oh, good. We're in agreement.
The fountain stays.
Thanks for stopping by, Katherine.
It's the same for all of us.
We try not to get too close
To the people who live next door.
It's easier to give them a polite nod
Than to ask what's wrong.
It's safer to keep walking
by than to get involved.
...you right now.
Okay, i don't wanna work...
True, we sometimes do
get to know the people
We share a fence with
and end up lifelong friends.
Thanks for everything.
Thank you.
But mostly,
we keep our distance
Because we'd rather our neighbors
Know nothing about us...
Than know too much.
Previously on...
Danielle came back home.
Lynette was afraid
for her children...
It feels like I've ruined their childhood.
Katherine's past...
We know all about chicago.
Came back to haunt her.
Oh, good. We're in agreement. The fountain stays.
Edie made thats...
If the i.r.s. Gets wind of your rainy day nd,
they could make me testify against you.
But evasive action was taken.
I want us to be together, too,
but I also wanna feel good
and Gaby and Carlos
ended their affair...
Too late.
Could you make it out to "cash"?
(Mary alice)as a little girl,
ritt was afraid of many things,
????
So they would wait for herwith rubber snakes
and croaking frogs... (ribbit)
and plastic spiders,
hoping to make edie scream.
But once she was a big girl,
edie britt was afraidof only one thing--
that her lover might leave her
for someone else,
and carlos solis knew this.
So when he decided to go,he tried to do it quickly...
What the hell is this?
Mostly to avoid her screaming.
It just hasn't been working for a long, longime.
(sighs) that's a lie. We were ppy.
Come on. L's not argue.
I want us to end this as friends.
I t you do, given all I know about your finances.
That's true. You know some of my secrets,
but I'm betting you still care enough about me to keep them.
All right.
I won't say anything to anyone
about your money in the grand caymans
on one condition--
You have to tell me the truth about why you're leaving.
The truth?
Is there someone else?
no.
Thank you, carlos.
You made this a lot easier.
Ye edie britt had been forcedto face her worst fear,
and she now feltit was only fair...
hi.
Um, i know a guy who's got millions
in a offshore bank account.
Who would I talk to about that?
That carlos should face his.

yes, it was that time of year.
Halloween had come once againto wisteria lane,
and no one was more determinedto celebrate its arrival
than the gay couplewho had just moved in.
So which of the neighbors should we invite first?
What does it matter? They all hate us? Oh, lee, that's not true. They hate you.
I'm the butch one they can feel comfortable around.
You keep telling yourself that. Let's start with bree.
She's got a gay son. I bet she's homo-friendly.
Why? My mother has one, and she's not.
hi.
Oh, hello.
We're just dropping by to let you know
we're having a halloween party. We'd! love for you to come.
Oh, well, thank you. Orson and I would be delighted.
Well, you can bring your whole family if you like.
Is that your daughter?
Uh, no,my daughter is in switzerland,
at boarding school.
Who was that?
My son...
Trying on his costume.
He's going to be cher this year.
Okay, he's definitely invited.
How many times have I told you to stay away from the windows?
I'm bored. You won't let me go outside.
Can't I at least look? At's that?
Oh, we've been invited to bob and lee's for halloween.
A costume party. Cool. Can I go?
Are you insane?
It's halloween. I'll go as a pumpkin.
You are due in three weeks.
Until then, no windows and no parties. (sighs)
so... This is gonna be fun.
Will you help me with a costume?
(chuckles) sure!
How familiar are you withop icons from the '70s?
Victor, it's me. I got your message.
I've gotta be honest, I'm very annoyed
that you're not coming home today like you promised.
I told you I have something very important to tell you,
and I want to do it in person,
but now you're gonna be home for another week,
and I can't wait.
Victor,i'm leaving you.
I... Can't believe I'm ending my marriage
on a hotel voice mai
this is very tacky.
You're forcing me to be tacky, victor.
I am not a tacky person. I am very, very classy.
(line clicks) oh! Hang on one second.
Hello? Hey, carlos. Yeah, i can't talk right now.
I'm breaking up with victor.
No, he's not here. He's in washington.
Yeah, okay,i'll explain later.
Sorry about that, victor.
Uh, anyway, it's over.
Uh, we both know it wasn't working.
Uh, good luck on everything,
and you don't have to call me back.
Okay, bye-bye.
ah.
I was surprised that my doctor suggested genetic counseling.
I didn't have to do that with my last baby.
Well, you were 26
????
Now you're--
Careful.
Old enough to benefit
from this particunar branch of medicine.
Nice save.
Now can we just skip to the part
where you tell me what's wrong with my baby?
Well, we don't know if anything's wrong.
See, we're just going over your family medical history
just--just to be on the safe side.
Okay. My aunt ella has arthritis.
I have two cousins with webbed feet,
and there's a whole
apparently, i married into carny folk.
(chuckles) okay, mike, what about your family?
Everybody's pretty healthy.
Uh, my grandther has epilepsy.
My father had high blood pressure,
on medication, so it's fine now.
What do you mean
????
'cause that's what you told me when we first started dating.
Oh. Well,i'm sorry if I gave you that impression.
It wasn't an impression.
You sa
(chuckles nervously) it's... Complicated.
How can it be complicated? He's either dead or alive.
Does it sound complicated to you, michelle? (cell phone buzzing)
oh, um...
Wow,i'm sorry. I-I've got an emergency plumbing call.
I'm gonna have to do this later. Uh, don't wait up.
Okay, so,um, mike's grandmother is epileptic?
Yeah.
But apparently, his dad can rise from the dead.
So let's hope the baby gets that gene.
Hey. How'd the p.e.t. Scan go?
She was a real trouper.
20 minutes inside that tube, she didn't complain once.
In a couple of days, we'll know if you beat this son of a bitch.
Hey, dr. Rushton is very optimistic.
(stella) fantastic. He's the best.
Hey, what do you say I ditch work,
and I take you to that... Thai place for lunch? Lynette?
Is that a hole? What?
In the garden there. Has something been digging in there?
Oh, it might be a possum. Ahem.
I-I saw one the other day.
????
Didn't know it was front-page news.
Well, we gotta do something about this.
And we will, so do you want to bring the kids,
or would you prefer
a, uh,gloriously romantic lunch with just me? I can't eat right now, tom.
I've got to go to the garden center
and get some fencing. God, this is annoying!
Can't believe you didn't tell me we have a possum!
Oh, you're, um, you're up.
I was just gonna try not to wake you.
Did you really think I was gonnalet you
without an mxplanation for your bizarre behavior?
Well, what good's a dream
????
I don't care what the issues are.
You don't deny your own dad's existence.
My father's in prison for murder.
So can you see why I might have wanted to lie about him
on a first date?
Oh, my god.
He's in jail for m
yeah.
He's doing life without parole.
Do you see him? I mean, do you have a relationship with him?
Uh, i visit a few times a year.
Well, I've got to meet him.
(chuckles) no, i don't think that's such a good idea. Well, he's your father.
I should know him, and besides, that genetic counselor
said we should gher data about your family's history.
Maybe you dad knows something you don't.
I mean, i should meet him r the sake of our baby.
Well, yeah. Fine. We'll go see him.
Thank you.
Mom! We're gonna bake you a cake
when the doctor says your cancer's gone.
Great. Here. Grab this.
What's this stuff for?
You know that possum that's been ruining our garden?
Yeah, me and preston named him scruffles.
Don't give him a name. He's not gonna be around much longer.
You're not gonna hurt him, are you?
Honey, i put up a fence, and he burrowed right under it.
The man at the garden center said these are crafty creatures,
and there's only one way to stop 'em.
So you're gonna kill h?
Sweetie, let me ask you something.
If you had to choose between mommy's beautiful garden
and a gross, mean, dirty possum,
what
scruffles.
Okay, we're done talking here.
You're sending me back to the convent?
Well, you certainly don't seem happy here, and I thought
maybe you were missing the nuns and the other girls.
Oh, whoopee. Knocked-up sluts and celibate freaks.
Start the party. (sighs)
whatever. I don't care. I just want this thing out of me.
You know, danielle, I just want you to be aware
that giving up this baby might be harder than you think.
It won't be a problem. Trust me.
Well, you say that now, but once you've held your child
and felt that rush of love, well...
It can change you.
Please. I hate this baby.
What has it done but make me fat
and ruin an enre year of my life?
I'm just saying, if I were you, I might be feeling--
Stop. Who says I have to feel the same things you'd feel?
I'm nothing like you.
You always s that like it's something to be p
but the day I see even a glimmer of myself in you
is the day that I realize
you've finally started... (whispers) to grow up.
Well, don't hold your breath.
No, on second thought,
do.
Hello, gabrielle.
oh!
(panting) milton... You scared me.
I thought you were in washington with victor.
I was. I got to the messages first.
Oh. You can't leave him, gabrielle.
Well, if he really wanted me to stay,
he would've come here himself, instead of siccing daddy on me.
Oh, victor hasn't heard the message.
I erased it. Oh, great.
Now I have to break up with him all over again.
You know, there's a lot of talk
about victor running for governor.
A divorce on the eve of a campaign could be...
ite
And you flew all the way here to twist my arm?
No, i had something a little more subtle in mind.
Milton, there is no amount of money that is--wow!
Yeah. You start tacking on those zeros,
it gets hard to stop.
Hold on.
This check is dated for next year.
Exactly.
If you want this money, you're gonna have
to stay married to my son for the next 13 months.
Huh.
And isn't there an election around that time?
My son is destined for greatness.
He will be governor.
He could be president.
And you're going to make sure
he goes straight to the top, aren't you?
Sometimes greatness needs a little nudge.
What do you mean, there's nothing there?
I'm sorry, ms. Britt.
I checked the number you gave me three times.
That offshore account simply doesn't exist.
Where is that $10 million?
What $10 million?
Gi?
(loudly) first of all, I deny having any illegal money,
let alone moving it.
Why are you talking like that?
I don't know. I thought you might be wearing a wire.
(slaps hand) you're paranoid. You know that?
Well, don't I have reason to be?
And why would you care where the money is,
unless you were planning on using it against me?
Oh, god. You think you are so clever. Well, you're no
in fact, you--you are the stupidest man I've ever met.
You have no clue who you're dealing with,
but believe me, you're gonna pay
for what you've done to me, carlos.
This game is not over.
Actually, it kinda is,
and if you hadn't noticed...
I won.
Bree.
Lynette, I was just thinking about you.
Did you get your test results yet?
Huh? O the p.e. Scan. No, not till tomorrow.
Listen, i need your help. There's a possum in my garden.
Ugh! I hate possums.
Not as much as me. I put out poison, but it ate around it.
I got one ofse hs, but all I trapped was penny.
How can I help?
I want a gun.
Really?
I thought you were one of those liberal gun haters.
That was the old lynette. The new lynette
kills the possums and lets god sort 'em out.
Well, unfortunately, our bleeding-heart town council
forbids us fm using live ammo in our own backyards.
Wusses!
I suggest you get an air rifle.
It won't kill it,
but it'll sting it enough to keep it away for good.
Perfect. Where can I get one?
Try, u gun city on route 6 by the baptist church.
Tell them I sent ya,
and they'll give youa nice discount.
Great.
What's so urgent?
Can't say hello to a girl?
Gaby, we had a deal.
We weren't gonna see each other for six months.
Oh, uh,yeah, about that
what if we make it 13?
Okay, no, just go with me on this.
What I'm about to propose will give us total financial freedom
and... Help a conniving billionaire's dream come true.
Whoa. What's this for?
Milton lang doesn't want me to leaveictor
until after he runs for governor.
Once the election's over, ka-ching!
So basically, you're taking money
to sleep with a man you don't love.
Gee, f that were a job, what w
I don't have to sleep with him,
just stay with him for fofofocal reasons.
It's basically a modeling fee for a 13-month photo op.
Absolutely not.
Carlos, you're not working right now,
and you know we'll never be happy if we're broke.
We need this.
What if we didn't?
Huh?
What if I had some money stashed away?
Okay, remember a few years ago
when I was in business with tanaka?
I was always afraid that he was gonna double-cross me.
Which he did.
But before he did,
I skimmed a little off the top.
How much is "a littl
$10 million.
You embezzled $10 million?
(kissing loudly) mmm.
Actually, now it's only about $9.5. It cost me half a mil
to hide it from the government and certain other people. Mm.
Oh, wait, wait, wait.
If this is tanaka money, then you had it when we were married?
Okay, i can sense where you're going with this.
Which also means you had it when we got divorced.
Look, if I had told you about it,
you'd have taken me to the cleaners. Carlos, we were married.
I was entitled to half of everything you embezzmed.
Look, we're back together now. What does it matter?
Well, it matters that you lied to me.
I can't trust you.
Gaby! If I can't trust you, i don't think I can be with you.
Oh, come on!
No,i'm serious. After everything I have been through?
No! No, get out!
Gaby, you should be happy right now.
I have millions of dollars, and I want you to be with me.
Oh, so you want me to sleep with you and take your money.
Gee, if thatere a job, what would they call it?
Thanks, kid.
Bear claw?
Uh, no. Thank you,
so, uh,mike said you had some medical questions for me?
Um, yes, the, uh,
genetic counselor, um,wanted to know a couple of things.
Uh...
Um,i-is there any cancer in your family?
no.
Great.
Uh, diabetes?
Mnh-mnh.
Wonderful.
Who did you kill?
Couldn't have covered this in the car?
I thought she ould hear it from you.
I killed my boss.
Uh-huh. Okay.
He wasn't my boss when I met him.
He was just another guy on the loading dock, like me.
A supervisor's job came up,
and, uh,we were both angling for it.
And then arnie- that was his name--
He went to the head of the company
and told him some lies about me,
and he got the job.
So you killed him?
No. I stewed about it for a few weeks.
I'd see arnie walking around with that smirk,
and, uh,and that tie, and I thought to myself,
"you k
"you don't deserve that tie,
and you don't deserve to live."
So you killed him?
No. I confronted him.
I said,"arnie, what you did wasn't right."
He just laughed in my face and said, uh,
"what are you gonna do about it?"
then I killed him.
Uh-huh.
Uh, and how did you...
With the tie. I thought it was a nice touch.
Well, now you know.
Hey, adam, katheri.
Or should I say frankenstein and... Marie antoinette?
Nice
you came as a self-important queen who lost all h
isn't that a bit on the nose?
Lee making jokes about a queen.
Isn't that a bit ironic?
????
(both chuckle) and who are you supposed to be?
Cher, the belove
(chuckles) it was my mom's idea.
You know, the woman who freaked when she found out I was gay?
oh.
Oh, my god. Is that danielle?
I expressly forbade her from coming tonight.
Who does she think she is?
Apparently, you.
Danielle, you're back!
(imitating bree) I'?
I am bree van de kamp hodge.
(chuckles) oh, no,no, no. No hugs, please.
I'm uncomfortable with needless displays of emotion.
Your costume looks great. It's so real.
Ooh! I could swear I felt a kick. (chuckles)
you stop that, baby hodge. We do not kick people,
unless?
(chuckles nervously) why didn't you tell me she was home?
Oh, it's just a quick visit. She's driving back tomorrow.
To switzernd?
Let's go get some cake, dear.
What do you think you're doing? Exactly what my moth wants.
You did say to be more like you, right?
That's not what I meant, and you know it,
and as for your little imitation of me,
I don't sound anything like that.
Danielle? Who are you supposed to be?
Really, karen, I don't think our lord is amused
when we make light of witchcraft,
and you might use a coaster.
Oh, i get it. She's you.
I just don't see how he could not feel bad about it.
I don't want to talk about this anymore.
You know, I expected to meet
a guy that was racked with rmmorse,
and instead,
i'm looking across the table at this...
Person. He's a person.
Yeah, an evil person.
No, he's a good guy who did an evil thing.
There's a difference.
Well, i don't see one.
Look, he snapped. It happens. People snap. I did.
I killed a guy.
You killed a cro
????
That's self-defense,
and even so, you regret it, right? Yes, of course.
Well, that's my t.d people snap,
they feel bad about it. Your dad doesn.
Sun, why are you getting so worked up over this?
I don't know. It just bothers me.
I mean... My god, mike.
He's yr dad.
I know.
And this conversation is exactly why I told you he was dead.
Lynette!
Honey, are you out here?
Shh!
Is that for the possum?
Yeah.
Now he's playing mind games with me,
but I laid out some halloween candy.
Pretty soon he'll get hungry, and when
trick or treat.
Lynette--
Shh!
Shh! Do you hear that?
He's making his move.
Lynette, I think you should come inside
and lie down for a little while.
No way. He's here, tom. I can tell.
Okay, now--now you're scaring me.
Why?
Look at yourself.
You've--you've declared jihad on a possum.
This is not a joke, tom. Something has attacked our home,
and when that happens, you don't just stand by--you fight it.
Sc?
And is trying to destroy us.
It will not defeat me.
Okay.
You do what you need to do.
Thank you.
So, bree, have you, uh,picked a name for the baby yet?
Not yet, but I'm thinking
"you're not good enough" if it's a boy,
and "you'll always disappoint me" if it's a girl.
Okay, you made your point. Now go home.
Are you kidding me?
This is the most fun I've had in eight months. Do not test me, young lady,
or I will drag you out of here myself.
You make a scene? Ha! That's a laugh.
What's wrong?
I think my wer just broke.
Oh, dear heavenly lord.
(bob) hey!
What happened to my rug?
Danielle!
We agreed to save that till the end of the night.
The best part of the costume,
and she pops the water balloon when people aren't even looking.
Orson! Andrew!
Think we can make it to the hospital?
I don't think so! It's coming.
Okay, everybody, in the house now.
Not on the couch. I just had it reupholstered.
Andrew, take your sister into the kitchen.
Get some towels. Boil some water.
Everything is gonna be fine. I'm a doctor.
You're a dentist! What if there are complications?
Should an emergency arise, we will simply call an amulet.
A what?
????
How many rum punches did you have?
There was punch in that rum?
I am going back to get adam.
Bree. Bree, what's wrong?
I need your services as a doctor,
but before I tell you what's going on,
I need you to promise that what you're about to learn
will be kept in strictest confidence. Does this have anything to do
with the pregnancy you've been faking?
Okay, you're almost there.
Aah!
????
(parker) are they home? (preston) the lights are on.
Here it comes!
If they're not home, then what's that?
Probably just a tapethey put on
well, you know the rule.
If we don't get our treat, they get a trick. Yeah.
(porter) come on. (giggles)
(baby wailing) and... Thank you.
Oh. (pants)
okay.
It's a beautiful baby boy.
How are you feeling?
Tired.
Did adam leave?
Uh, yeah, and he promised
that no one would ever know what happened here tonight.
That's good, i guess.
Is he okay?
????
He's, um, he's all cleaned up now,
if... If you want to hold him.
Yeah.
He's so tiny.
He looks just like you did.
Do you want to be alone?
Do you want me to...
To go?
What should I do?
Yoshould take him.
Are you sure?
Sweethea?
No, it's...
The right thing to do for everyone...
Especially him
but you're right.
It's awful.
I'm gonna sleep w.
Okay, baby.
It's okay, little on
here we are. Here we go.
Yes, here we go.
Susan, hey, it's me.
Um, sorry to leave this message on your machine,
but can you tell the other girls
i'm, uh,going to be by myself for a while?
I... Just...
Going through some stuff and need to think.
Um--oh, god, that's my car ready to take me to the airport,
so I'll tell you everything when I get back.
Okay? Love you. Bye.
This is nice.
I didn't order a stretch, but I'll take it.
Victor.
I tried reaching you at the house,
but the maid said you'd moved out.
I took the next flight home. What's going on?
Well, I'm... Sort of leaving you.
Well, i guess "sort of" is better than "definitely."
What do I have to do to make it "absolutely not"?
I'll do anything. Just tell me.
Victor, it's not that simple. We have major problems,
and you nevehave time to talk about them, let alone fix 'em.
Well, i guess better make some time.
Let's see.
Here's this weekend.
Here's next week.
The week after. Look at that. I've got a whole month.
You busy?
Victor, i know you're only doing this
because a divorce would hurt your run for governor.
What if I don't run?
You mean that?
The governor's mansion is my father's dream.
You know what my dream I'
you.
Don't run away, gaby...
And if you do, please, take me with you
so... Where's mike?
At the motel. I slipped out without waking him.
I've been up all night thinking,
and I have something to say to you.
oh?
I don't believe you.
I don't believe that you could kill a man and not regret it.
Why do you care?
Because I am carrying a baby that has your genes.
If my doctor told me that there was
something wrong with this baby- something physical,
I could handle that.
I would pr
but if my baby was born without a conscience, without a soul,
I don't know what I would do.
You think I don't have a soul?
If you can't feel the tiniest bit of remse
over taking a human life...
No, i don't think you do.
If I were to think about what I did,
really think about it,
lay awake nights
trying to remember the look on that guy's face
when I strangled the life out of him...
Pretty soon,i'd go crazy.
I should go.
You know what I do regret?
What I did to mike.
What did youo?
He was a real popular kid. Everybody liked mikey.
(clicks tongue) then when I got sent away,
suddenly the whole town
just thinks of him as the son of a murderer.
????
I'm not re that kind of darkness
ever truly goes away.
Well, you're wrong.
He's happy.
He's got a good job and a wife who loves him
and a baby on the way.
I had a lot going for me, too, before I t
just...
Keep on eye on him.
Edie, if you're looking for gaby,
she just left for her yoga class.
Yoga... Is that what she told you?
I'm sorry.
I know how angry and humiliated you must feel.
But don't take it all out on gaby.
Carlos seduced her.
He hated you for taking his wife,
so he decided to make a fool out of you.
I think he deserves whatever's coming to him, don'v you?
Hey! Hey! Hey, quiet. She's napping.
Finally. How'd you get her to do that?
oh,
????
????
Hmm, it's Dr. Rushton.
Her oncologist?
Hey.
Hey, dr. Rushton.
What--what are you doing here?
Well... (sighs) so much of my job is delivering bad news,
that I really wanted to tell you this in person.
Lynette, i got the test results back. You're clean.
Are you sure? Yeah.
(stglla) oh! Lymph nodes are completely clear. Congratulations.
I knew it. I knew it!
Did you hear that? Did you hear that
this is so amazing. I'm gonna go get the kids.
Hey, doc, you look like you need a margarita.
(laughing) and even if you don't, I ain't drinng alone.
(voice breaks) I'm sorry.
There is muchto be afraid of in this world,
but what we fearhas nothing to do
with gruesome masks
or plastic spiders
or lifelike monsters.
No, it's the thoughts
that terrify us the most...
What if she comes to regrether decision?
what ihe really is unhappy?
what if the chance for lovehas passed forever?
how do we conquerthese terrifying thoughts?
we start by reminding ourselves
what does not kill us...
Just makes us stronger.
Previously on Desperate Housewives...
Danielle had her baby...
...on halloween.
You said my father
didn't care about me.
Katherine revealed a secret.
I want you to imagine the worst thing
That a father can do to his daughter.
Lynette got great news.
I got the test results back.
You're clean.
While Mike tried to ease his pain,
Victor... You know what my dream is?
...reached out to Gaby.
You.
Don't run away, Gaby.
But if you do, take me with you.
And Edie got revenge.
Don't take it all out on Gaby.
Carlos decided to make
a fool out of you.
The thing you need to know
about Victor Lang
Is that he was not above
using deception.
Whether it was an
insincere promise
To a campaign donor,
Or the artful evasion of a
reporter's question,
Or an outright lie to his constituents,
Victor did what he had to to
get what he wanted.
But thanks to some
compromising photos,
He learned that his wife
Knew a little something
about deception as well.
For the last time,
Carlos, stop calling me.
I told you, i just wanna talk.
And i told you it's over.
So what,
You're just gonna go back to that
chicken-lipped albino? I don't know.
I'm taking it one day at a time.
But what i can say about Victor is
He doesn't lie to me about how
much money he's got. Look,
I said i was sorry.
Oh, that's great.
Yeah, well, i-i gotta go, Bree.
It's Bree.
Okay, so i just informed my staff
That i'm taking the next month off
To give my wife the
honeymoon she always wanted.
That's amazing.
Where should we go? Well,
I left some travel
magazines in the bedroom.
Why don't you go get 'em? Oh!
Oh, my god, Victor.
A month in rio sounds like
heaven, doesn't it?
Oh, it does.
Let's do it. Ooh!
Hey, why don't we kick
off our reconciliation
With a little weekend on the boat?
That's so romantic.
I love that. Huh?
Just you and me, all alone,
out in the middle of the ocean.
The girls are gonna be so jea Lou s.
Oh, no, no, no, let's not tell
anyone we're going.
It'll be our little secret.
Yes, Victor was not above
Using deception to get
what he wanted,
And what he wanted now
Was revenge.
The next day on Wisteria Lane
began with a bit of deceit.
Bree Hodge told her friends
She had given birth in the
middle of the night
To a beautiful baby boy.
And thanks to the healthy lungs
of Benjamin Tyson Hodge,
It didn't take long for Bree 's friends
To engage in some deceit of their own.
Well, he's just a little piece of heaven.
You're so blessed. Makes me wanna
have another one myself.
Orson, you better take
Benjamin to the other room
Before my friends run out of lies. Ah.
No.
They don't appreciate a healthy
pair of lungs, that's all, huh?
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.
Come on, Benjamin.
Hey, Lynette, you tell everyone your news?
No. This is about the baby.
Wait. Did you have that final scan?
Did you hear something?
Well, the results are back,
And while you can never
actually say you're cured--
She's cured!
Oh, my god!
Oh, yeah!
I have to get checked every six months,
But, yes, the doctor is very optimistic.
Hey, what the hell is all this racket?
Someone win the lotto?
Oh, i was just telling everybody
the good news about my...
Cancer.
Hey, congrats!
I'm a survivor myself.
Prostate.
Ooh, muffins.
Hey, show some class.
Introduce yourself.
Hi. I'm Stan.
Is th--is that my robe?
Yeah. Sorry, uh...
If i knew when i walked into
that card club last night
That i would be going home
with this lovely lady,
I'd have packed me
a change of clothes.
Okay, i get it.
We'll get out of your hair.
Come on, handsome.
Let's take a shower.
Mike, how long are you gonna be?
We've gotta get this food over to
Bree 's before it gets cold.
You know, Susan, i don't feel like
going over there tonight.
Can't you just drop it off?
No, they just had a baby.
We're gonna "ooh," we're gonna "ahh,"
and then we're gonna eat.
But i'm tired.
I worked all day.
I got a job first thing in the morning.
There's no way out of it, Mike.
Just do what you need and downstairs.
This is what we do in the suburbs.
Ah, yes...
The suburbs.
And how does Danielle
like her baby brother?
Oh, she adores him.
She just felt terrible that she had to
leave for school so soon.
Speaking of which, we have some
extra preschool applications
If the two of you are interested.
Isn't it a little early to
be talking preschool?
She just got pregnant.
Our baby still looks like a sea horse. Oh, honey.
You'd be surprised how
fast the best schools fill up.
And only the best for our kid, right?
I'd start saving your pennies.
Bonny briar's up to $10,000 a year.
10,000 dollars...
For used legos and a potty chair?
And you'd better apply now.
Debbie gottlieb had her baby
the same day i did,
And she could only get wait-listed
At her first three choices.
Oh, by the way, we were invited
to her bris this saturday.
Well, make an excuse for me.
I thought you liked Debbie and Lou.
Oh, i do.
I just don't care to watch them
ritually mutilate their child.
More moo shu, please.
Circumcision's not mutilation.
It's a simple surgery
Meant to promote lifelong
masculine hygiene.
It's a, uh, traumatic procedure
Which reduces the male's
capacity for sexual pleasure
By desensitizing the tip of--
We know what it is.
Gee, i don't think i've ever heard
Such strong opinions on the subject.
I mean, not that it's something i talk about a lot...
Or ever.
I hope i didn't offend you.
I haven't heard a word since "$10,000."
It's just that i remember my own
circumcision so vividly.
Oh, that's ridicu Lou s.
My parents disagreed on this issue, too.
My dad said no.
So mother just bided her time
Until he finally left town on business.
I was 5.
She told me we were
going for ice cream.
That's why the procedure should
be done on babies.
They won't remember.
Now can we please just drop this?
Fine.
So, Susan,
You mentioned something
about bringing dessert.
What is it?
Ice cream.
Sorry.
Oh, so you found the chocolate sauce?
Oh, uh, yeah, it's right here.
Is everything okay? Oh, yeah.
I was just taking a couple of aspirin.
I hope Orson 's rant didn't
give you a headache.
Oh, no, i've just still got a little
pain from my accident,
That's all. Still?
That was nearly two years ago.
Well, it's just a twinge every now and then.
Aspirin does the trick.
No, no, no, no. I'll get that.
I thought you kept your
boat at the yacht club.
Yeah, i wanted to leave from here.
This way, we avoid the congestion at the marina.
Where's the crew?
There's no crew.
I let 'em go.
What?
Who's gonna bring us umbr Ella drinks
And salute us when we walk by?
Just consider me your one-man navy.
So you're gonna drive this thing by yourself?
Well, you can help.
Didn't that captain give you
lessons last summer?
Oh, that's right--
Those two boring hours
i'll never get back.
Well, the good news is this trip will be
anything but boring.
We need to talk about this Stan thing.
Oh, is that his name? Stan?
Uh, when he left,
i just sort of said, "see ya."
Well, it got me thinking
About how much you've had to
put your life on hold
These past few months.
No big deal.
No, it was a big deal.
You have taken amazing care of me.
But i know you have so many things
you wanna get back to.
Mm, not really.
Come on. It must be driving you crazy
Living with five screaming
kids underfoot.
I don't blame you for wanting a
little peace and quiet.
You need to leave, mom.
Okay.
Okay, i-i know i shouldn't have brought...
Stan into the house.
And next time, i promise you we
will do it in the car.
It's not just that.
It's the smoking and the swearing
And the teaching the kids how to
make a whiskey sour.
It's a science, Lynette.
It's called mixology.
I just think it would work
better for everyone
If you got your own place.
Okay. With what money?
You have money, right?
I mean, you loaned us that $10,000.
Yes, i did.
Wait a minute.
That was all the money you had?
You guys needed it,
and i needed a place to stay.
It seemed like it turned out
pretty well for everybody.
What do you mean?
I thought you were living with Lucy.
Your sister kicked me out.
Not to put too fine a point on it, Lynette,
But your cancer couldn't
have come at a better time.
Hey, i need your help with a school thing.
Wow. You never ask for my help.
Must be something easy.
What do you know about Dylan 's dad?
We've got this
genealogy project for school,
And she wants to find out about him.
Maybe Dylan should ask her mom.
She gets really weird talking about him.
Why is that, by the way?
Okay, don't tell anybody i told you this.
Her mom said something at my party
About her dad being
abusive towards Katherine ...
And maybe Dylan, too.
Oh. So i'm thinking that it would be better
If you could get her to research
somebody else in her family.
Yeah.
Maybe you're right.
Listen, i-i was talking to my mom, and--
Yeah.
I heard.
Susan? Hi. It's, uh,
Bree. I'm glad you're home.
Uh, listen, i-i thought i might
stop by for a little visit.
Look, i've only got, uh,
about an hour before my next job.
Uh, is it okay if i grab lunch in front of the tv?
I wanted to watch the game.
Oh, sure. I'll--i'll bring up a tray.
Oh, thanks.
Bree thinks you're doing drugs.
She found this on her kitchen floor,
And it's not aspirin.
Well, you know, my
shoulder's been hurting lately.
She says it's a narcotic,
and it's highly addictive.
Given your history--
Whoa, whoa, Susan,
these--these were prescribed by a doctor
Right after my accident.
I found a couple in the medicine cabinet,
And i've been carrying 'em around
In case my shoulder acts up. Really?
Yeah. Really. They were the last two.
So you got nothing to worry about.
Oh, thank god!
You have no idea where my mind went.
I had you roaming
back alleys to score your dope,
Pawning our good silver to pay your dealer.
And we don't even have good silver,
So it got worse 'cause you had
to knock over a gas station
To buy the silver to pawn it off.
I was really making myself crazy.
I'm sorry about that.
But i reiterate- old pill, no problem.
I knew it. I'm so happy.
Mmm. Good.
Mm, now fix me some lunch, woman.
Oh! I w Ann a watch the damn game.
Can i help you?
Yes, um, can you tell me
who i would talk to
About having my baby circumcised?
What do you mean you can't help me?
I received a registered letter from
your husband which reads,
"i do not wish for my son, Benjamin Hodge,
"to be circumcised.
Should the recipient of this
letter encounter my wife...
"please feel free to show her this letter
"and assure her of its wide distribution
"to hospitals and physicians
Across this and two neighboring states."
Does this seem too warm to you?
That you even felt such a
thing was necessary.
Well, obviously, it was.
Forgive me for knowing my wife.
What's that supposed to mean?
You don't trust me?
I trust you not to break your word.
Since you've pointedly refused to give it,
I trusted you to snip first and
debate the merits later.
I'm only thinking of Benjamin.
Be reasonable.
You're the one who's unreasonable.
What have you got against
untrimmed penises?
They're... Unsightly.
I do not want our son to be teased...
For being different. Do you?
Ah, so in the end,
It all comes down to tradition and conformity.
What is wrong with that?
I thought we liked conformity.
Not at the price of pain and
reduced sexual pleasure.
I can tell you someone
whose sexual pleasure
Is going to be reduced big-time!
Hey, sweetheart.
What's that?
Just something for school.
What was that name you just typed in?
We were assigned a genealogy project.
I have to do research on my father.
I will call your tea Cher.
She'll assign you a different project.
What do you think you're doing?
I am learning about my father.
Dylan! For years, you have told me
That my father is too evil to talk about.
Now i find out you've discussed him
At a neighborhood game night?!
Regardless, i am still your mother,
And while you're under my roof,
You will obey my rules.
And what if i don't?
Are you gonna slap me again,
kick me out of the house?
Go ahead. Try it. See what happens.
I'm sorry, mom.
You can't stop me this time.
I am officially no longer afraid of you.
And he needed something for the pain,
so he happened to find
The last two pills in the medicine cabinet,
And he took 'em.
It's no big deal.
Let me show you something.
You see this breadmaker?
This is where i hid a bottle of chardonnay
After i told everyone i'd stopped drinking.
Oh, but this isn't the same thing.
Mike wouldn't lie to me about this.
And this rotating spice rack?
Those little airplane bottles of vodka
Fit perfectly in the back.
He said there were no more pills.
I was looking him in the eye.
Susan, addicts are experts at deception.
My advice to you--
Trust...
But verify.
So... This is nice--
Little family get-together.
Why didn't you call Lucy?
Oh, you know her, always busy.
So, mom... You look good.
Thanks. You seeing anybody?
Not that i wanna tell you about.
Mm, still alone.
Ooh, look. The special is chicken.
Doesn't that sound good?
Ooh, order me one.
I-i'm going to the bar and--
and check the score on the game. Have fun.
I know what this is, and i'm not doing it.
What? What? We're having lunch.
She's not moving back in.
I resist your attempts to manipulate me.
Nobody is manipulating you.
My boundaries are strong.
I know what i want, and i deserve to be happy.
What have you got there?
Are you reading from something?
Okay!
As soon as you invited me to lunch,
I called my therapist.
And he told me
You'd try to guilt me into
taking mom back, but...
"i will not be emotionally blackmailed."
Give me that.
I already had her, Lynette.
She stayed with me for two years--
Two years in which my weight ballooned.
She put me through four
different hairstyles.
Once, she even brought home
this guy she met at a bar.
She's so not like that now.
I don't care.
The day she moved out,
i got my life back.
So if you w Ann a have lunch, fine.
But that's it.
Okay. Okay.
Okay.
Good for you.
I'm sorry.
Where's the chicken?
Oh, yeah. Where is that waiter?
I'm gonna go find him.
Just hear me out.
If you trim the sides in a little,
I think you'll lose that wingy
effect you have going now.
Mom!
Well, i'm just saying that with
the shape of your face,
You're not doing yourself any favors.
Do you think
You could go for one minute
without being critical?
What are you talking about?
I have not said one word about
your eye shadow yet.
"i reject your negativity.
I am as beautiful as i feel inside."
Oh, it's you.
Thank you for calling about my painting.
I can't believe i forgot that.
Yeah, i know it meant a lot to you.
There's a hole in it.
Yeah, i don't get modern art either.
Okay, Edie ...
I know that you're angry right now, but--
You think i'm angry?
You should've seen Victor.
What?
Yeah, we had a little chat.
Actually, he didn't believe that you
were screwing his wife...
Until i showed him some photos,
And then he was just enraged.
It was a little scary.
For god sakes, Carlos,
Am i gonna have to change this number?
Victor knows.
Knows what? Everything.
Edie told him we're having an affair.
No, that's impossible.
He hasn't said a word.
In fact, i've never seen him so s
weet and attentive.
It's an act!
Edie said he was enraged.
Well, if he's so mad at me,
Why would he take me on a boat trip?
He took you on a boat?
Oh, crap. I think you need to get out of there.
Gaby?
I-i was just talking to... Bree.
Oh. Oh, no, no.
We agreed--total privacy.
When we head home,
you can have it back.
And you can talk to...
Bree as much as you like.
Can i get you something?
No, i'm good.
You okay?
Uh, actually, i'm really cold.
Maybe we should bail and
do this another day.
You know, when it's warmer.
It'll warm up.
Oh, okay, well, just in case,
we should run back to shore
So i can grab a jacket.
Gaby...
You're not going anywhere.
I'm not?
I know about everything--you,
Carlos, the affair, everything.
Okay. I am so sorry.
But in my defense,
You were always gone,
And you knew how needy i
was when you married me.
That's it?
That's all you have to say to me?
Well, it'd be easier to talk if we
were back on shore.
What are you doing?
It's bad enough you've betrayed me.
Now i have to listen to your whining?
I brought something for you.
Gaby!
Gaby!
Gaby!
What's that?
Everything i know about your father--
Date of birth, his mother's name,
Last known address.
It's everything you need to find him.
Thank you.
Before you take this...
You have to promise me something.
Okay.
You c Ann ot bring him here...
Or even tell him where i am.
Why?
The last time that i saw your father,
It was to tell him that i was leaving him,
And i was taking you with me.
He, uh, he always liked to s
lap me around a little bit.
But that night was...
Unimaginable.
I don't remember everything.
I-i was in pretty bad
shape by the end of it.
But once he was done
Slamming my face into the wall,
He started choking me,
And he kept screaming
That he was gonna kill me.
And the last thought
That i had...
Was what would happen to you if i died.
So you can't tell him where i am.
You just can't.
Maybe you can talk to my
tea Cher Tom orrow...
And have her give me another assignment.
Thank you.
I told you, if you're
gonna have a tree house...
You've gotta keep it clean.
Here. Take these and
dump them by the front door.
Hey, what the hell are you doing?!
Mom, hurry. Get out of the car.
No, no, no.
You are not leaving those here.
Hi, mom.
Take her away. Unh-unh, Lynette.
You may have been able to
strong-arm the weak one,
But not me. I'm not weak!
Then why did you call me?
Get out of our way. Lucy,
Every fight we have ever had
Has ended with my foot on your neck.
I guarantee that this one's
gonna end the same way, too.
Maybe we should talk inside.
I'm often asked why the torah tells us
That a child must be circumcised
on the eighth day of his life.
Some say that's how long it takes
to get a decent caterer.
What a lovely ceremony.
I'm deborah's friend Bree.
I have what may strike you as
a very odd request.
Trust me, it won't be one i haven't heard.
Do you think, while you're here,
Do could do a bris for my baby, too?
Okay, new one.
Good for you.
I know it might seem tacky
piggybacking on deborah's bris,
But... We could do it in the
den very quietly.
Uh, well, as we just saw,
There's so such thing as a quiet bris.
You said your name was Bree?
Yes, Bree Hodge ...
Born rabinowitz.
Huh. I wouldn't have taken you for jewish.
I should only have a Nickel for
every time i've heard that.
Don't you want a proper bris
With your friends and family there?
I would love that,
But my husband Orson --
big, stubborn, goy.
He says we should do nothing
And let the child decide when he's grown.
We don't pick our parents--
we should pick our religion?
I wouldn't feel right doing this
Without speaking to your husband.
Well, he's out of town, and...
Our Benjamin is 8 days old today.
And if i don't do this,
My grandma...
Tzeitel...
Will never forgive me,
may she rest in peace.
You realize that this is a covenant?
That whatever your husband says,
You are promising
To raise your child as a devout jew?
I swear to you before god
That this child will be as
devout a jew as i am.
Hey, where have you been?
I woke up, and you were gone.
Oh, we had a very busy day.
We dropped off the dry cleaning,
We deposited money into
our christmas account,
And then we got circumcised.
You did what?!
It's just a little unsightly foreskin.
He'll never miss it.
So why stop there?
Why--why not cut off his testicles?
You obviously have no problem
going after mine. Orson.
Well, what do you call it, Bree?
Going behind my back,
ignoring my feelings on this?
I gave them very serious consideration.
But it's my blood running in his veins,
Which ultimately makes it my decision.
Your blood?
So who am i to Benjamin?
A friendly uncle?
A male nanny?
Of course not.
Then why do you treat me
Like i'm anything less than his father?
I mean, haven't i earned that
During the course of our little hoax?
I lied for you. I-i risked public humiliation.
I do everything but strap on the
pregnancy harness myself.
I know that.
I see myself as Benjamin 's father.
I need to know if you see me that way, too.
I know how much you love Benjamin.
I guess...
I guess i just have to remember
That it's love that makes us a
family and not blood.
Your son would like you to hold him.
By the way, his hebrew name is Simcha.
I'll explain later.
Oh, Carlos, thank god you're here.
Where is he? Where's Victor?
Well, i-i clubbed him and
knocked him overboard.
He's in the ocean?!
He was going to kill me!
He had a gun.
Okay, okay, let me think.
You saw him in the water.
I mean, he's not dead, right?
No, he's mad, but he wasn't dead.
So then we'll send someone
out there to fish him out.
We'll call the police, show 'em the gun
And tell that 'em that it was self-defense.
You still have the gun?
It's in there.
Well, maybe he wanted it to muffle the gun.
There is no gun.
Ice pick?
What are you doing?
I'm calling the coast guard.
And tell them what,
i knocked my husband overboard
Because he was coming
after me with a sweater?
No, come on.
We gotta go back out there.
Guys, i can't be any clearer on this.
I am not taking her back.
It's your turn, simple as that.
I've had her for four months.
I also had cancer for four months,
And if i could've asked one of them to leave,
I'm not sure which i would've picked.
Oh, four months, boohoo.
I had her for a year,
And that was the year she joined
the gin of the month club.
I don't have any room for her.
I already have seven
people in four bedrooms.
There it is- the "i have a family" card.
Congratulations.
You can reproduce.
We're all thrilled for you.
Why can't you take her?
You are in that huge
house all by yourself
That you got from the divorce.
Dave and i are just separated.
There's a good chance
that he's moving back in,
But not if mom is living there. Well,
We can't just throw her out on the street.
I can.
My therapist said
It's time for me to be a
little more "lydia-centric."
I really w Ann a meet this jackass.
Okay, we all have our excuses,
But we gotta figure something out.
Come on. She is our mother.
Is she?
She never acted like one,
not that i can remember.
I remember she showed up
drunk to my graduation,
Wearing a housecoat.
Okay, but the point is, she went.
Remember that one christmas?
And we came down,
and there was mom under the tree,
Passed out drunk in the middle
of all of our unwrapped toys.
My raggedy Ann smelled like
peppermint schnapps.
Okay, she wasn't perfect, clearly.
But she gave birth to us.
We owe her our lives,
and now that she needs us,
We can't just turn our back on her.
I know i'm supposed to feel guilty,
but i don't.
I don't either.
It's like you're saying you
don't care about her.
At all?
And i don't under Stan d that.
Well... If you care so much,
Then the answer to the problem
is sorta obvious, isn't it?
We can help with money.
I can send you $100 a month.
I don't need your money.
I can take care of my mother all by myself.
Lynette...
Here's how you can help--
Don'tvisit for the next few years,
Cause it seems fairly likely
I won't have stopped hating you by then.
I guess that's her way of asking us to leave.
Mom, where's grandma going?
Going?
Wait.
What's that?
Gaby!
Here. Sit him here.
You tried to kill me.
Well, i came back for you, didn't i?
What were you thinking?!
Well, i thought you were trying to kill me.
I was just trying to talk to you,
See if we still had a chance.
I see that you're still screwing this guy.
And what the hell is he doing on my boat?!
You mean, besides saving your life?
That was a big mistake, buddy.
Oh, right.
Yeah, you're the guy that said
If anyone messed with your woman,
That you'd use your money to
make 'em disappear.
But right now it's just you and me.
So how tough are you
without your a.t.m. Card?
That's what i figured.
Aah! Victor!
Oh, my god!
Victor! Oh! Oh, my god!
Come on. Get up! Hey. Hey.
Get up.
I wanna see the look on your face
When the knife goes in.
Oh, i'm getting pretty good at that.
Okay, let's pull him back in again.
What, are you crazy?! Oh,
We'll just tie him up so he
doesn't cause any trouble.
Victor!
Where'd he go? Victor!
Victor! Victor!
Maybe we should go back out
and look some more.
We looked for six hours. He's gone.
Oh, my god. We killed him.
It was self-defense, right?
I mean, he was trying to kill us.
We can't prove that.
This is bad, Gaby.
Oh, when people find out we were on
that boat with him, it...
Maybe they won't.
What do you mean?
No one but you knows i was with Victor.
I'll say he went out alone.
I told him i was leaving him,
And he was depressed, suic Ida l even.
Only one problem--
The boat's right here.
Then maybe the boat needs to go back out...
Alone.
Whatever you're thinking,
i can explain.
I'm thinking that you're a
drug addict and a liar,
So say something that's not that.
Susan, listen--
Is it so horrible living with me?
I mean, do i make you so miserable
That you can't even face me
without numbing the pain?
Of course not.
I love you.
Well, if you did, you wouldn't be doing this!
I mean, my god, Mike,
we have a baby on the way!
Can i say something now?
Sure, go ahead.
Oh, should i look you in the eyes?
Does it make it easier for you to lie?
I didn't tell you...
About the pills 'cause
i didn't want you to feel guilty.
Me feel guilty?
Yeah.
When i put in that water
heater for McCluskey,
I really wrenched my shoulder,
And the doctor told me i should
take a break, but i didn't
Because that was the day we
found out you were pregnant.
And from then on,
all i have heard about
Are car seats and strollers
and $10,000 preschools.
You know, it didn't seem like
A really good time for me to quit working.
Mike, we don't need any of that stuff.
Yeah.
You say that now.
But when Benjamin Hodge is in harvard,
And our kid's just a plumber like his dad...
I just want to be able to give him
The advantages i never got.
God, the only advantage he needs
Is to have a healthy dad who's not doing this.
You're right.
I get it. Okay?
I'm done.
I w Ann a believe you. It's just...
That addicts are good at lying.
Yeah.
All right...
How about this?
You believe me now?
Thank you.
Deception--
You find it in all the best homes.
Parents rely on it when
dealing with inquisitive children...
Women use it to help keep
secrets--big and small.
Lovers need it
To cover up inconvenient accidents.
Why do people resort to deception?
Because it's a handy tool
That helps get us
Exactly what we'relooking for.
Previously on
Desperate Housewives
Mike was the victim...
Of a hit and run.
Lynette couldn't forgive her ther's past.
You had tom to come home to.
I had your stepfather.
Hey, glen may have bored you, but the years we had
a father in that house were the happiest of my life.
You drove him away.
Mom, where's grandma going?
Bree got her second chance
to be a good mother.
Mike's dependency grew...
Addicts are experts at deception.
Victor!
Get up.
I wanna see the look on your face
when the knife goes in.
And victor was lost at sea.
We think of the past as
water under the bridge,
a current that carries away
the mistakes of our youth--
the loves we lost...
The addictions we gave into...
The opportunities we threw away...
But sooner or later,
reminders drift back into our lives...
Of the mistakes we made...
And the sins we committed.
Carlos, why are you calling me?
I told you we can't be seen together.
I can't take it anymore.
We gotta go to the cops.
Oh, okay.
And say what?
"yes, officer,"my lover and i knocked
my husband overboard twice and left him for dead.
Okay.Bye-bye.
"i don't think so.
But he's the mayor.
You know, people are gonna notice he's missing,
and then they're gonna ask questions.
Let them ask.
No one knows we were on that boat.
Let's just play dumb and ride this thing out.
Gaby, don't you feel guilty?
A man is dead.
Yes, i feel awful, but he threatened our lives.
It was self-defense.
Exactly.
So then why don't we go and tell the police?
He took the lord's name in vain.
Look, we have a good plan.
Let's just stick to it.
Okay, okay.
I won't say anything.
Good.
Now until this blows over, don't call me again.
What are you doing now?
I'm praying for a miracle.
Carlos, if victor had lived,
he would've killed us.
I'm thinking we already had our miracle.
Yes, the mistakes of our past have
a way of drifting back into our lives...
And when they do...
We have to pay for them.
/One day in the early fall,
/Mike Delfino hurt his shoulder
God.
To ease his pain, he took a little
white pill recommended by his doctor.
The pain persisted, so he took another...
And another.
Unfortunately, when mike's pain began to subside,
his need for the little white pills...
Did not.
But mike never shared this
with those who cared about him,
only with those who could
not have cared less.
Hey, it's mike.
I'm out.
I need to meet you tomorrow.
Great.
Got that money you owe me?
No, but you know i'm good for it.
You price chistry textbooks lately?
They're, like, 300 bucks.
I need my money, mike.
And you'll get it, all right?
Can't you just front me something for now?
Well, advice is free.
Pills aren't.
My advice--get some cash.
So, hey, you know, i better get going.
Yeah, um, i should, too.
Mom.
Can we talk?
This will just take a second.
Did you kiss thaboy?
No, i was kind of interrupted.
Oh, well, you're gonna tnk me.
Do you know that he has his tongue pierced?
Yeah.
He showed me.
How do you know?
I checked out his web page.
You did not.
I did, too, and do you know
what else he has pierced?
And if you do, you're grounded.
Okay, yes, mom, derek has bought
into the who piercing craze,
but aren't you the one
who told me to not judge a book by its cover?
If the cover has holes in it,
the book is no good.
Okay, this conversation is over.
I am going to kiss derek good night.
Oh, fine.
Break my heart.
Why are you freaking out?
We're just dating.
It's not like he's trying
to put a ring on my finger.
Trust me.
Your finger is not where he'd put it.
Aw, he's so beautiful when he sleeps.
I'll put him in the crib.
No, he'll be sleeping with us.
Why?
Is he running a fever?
He's fine, but i've been doing so reading,
and more and more people say that
babies sleep better next to their parents.
It's called the "family bed".
Ono, i've heard of that.
Isn't it designed to facilitate breast-feeding?
Partly.
What's your point?
You're not lactating.
If our son wants to be near the milk,
he'll have to sleep in the refrigerator.
This isn't just for me and benjamin.
This will help you bond with him, too.
Oh, perhaps, but it's sure not
gonna help me bond with you.
Darling, sex is the last thing women
want right after they've given birth.
But you didn't give birth.
You watched and served refreshments.
Well, that doesn't make caring
for an infant any less tiring.
Can't we just give it a chance?
I suppose.
What if i roll over and crush him?
Don't.
Yes, hi.
I'm looking for my mom.
She hangs out at your bar sometimes.
Stella wingfield?
Uh, older lady, big oker, talks like a teamster.
Well, that's your fault for letting her run a tab.
Look, if you see her,
could you tell her to call lynette?
Thank you.
I know that you are worried,
but i am sure your mother is fine.
She's broke and old and rude.
That is not a winning combination on the street.
Stella is very resourceful.
Didn't you tell me that she once made her own booze
by putting a bag of oranges under the radiator?
Lucy, lydia and i fought over who had to take her.
She was right outside.
God only knows what she heard us say.
Yeah, well, after the crap she puyou guys through,
you have every right to resent her.
It is a lot easier to resent your parents
when you know they're safe in some retirement village,
but to know that she's out there,
maybe lying facedown in an alley...
This is exactly what she wants you to do.
She wants you to feel guilty.
Don't buy into it.
Okay.
Okay.
I guess you're right.
Lynette.
The morgue is listed under government offices, right?
Mrs.Lang?
The police are here.
Ma'am.
I'm detective berry.
This is detective lyons.
Can we ask you a few questions?
Of course.
When was the last time you saw mr.Lang?
I guess two days ago.
Why? What's wrong?
His office has reported him missing.
Oh, no.
They did?
And this morning, the coast guard
found his empty boat floating in the y.
Oh, my god.
I hope this isn't...
Last time i saw him,
i to him i was leaving him.
How did he react to that news?
Well, he took it pretty hard.
Oh, you don't think he did anything stupid, do you?
Well, actually, we don't.
You don't?
When we examined the boat,
we didn't find a single fingerprint, not even mr.Lang's.
Well, that's weird.
What--what do you think that means?
It would indate somebody wiped
that boat down after mr.Lang was...
Gone.
Whoever was on that boat is clearly not that bright.
Okay, this is no time for name-calling.
A man is missing.
Well, don't worry, ma'am.
We got our best men on this case, 'round the clock.
We'll find out exactly what happened to your husband.
Great.
mom Went to mall with derek. Back late.
I'm barrett.
Is mike home?
No, he's at work.
Oh, shoot.
I needed to talk to him.
Wee, uh, just doing some business together.
Well, i don't know when he's gonna be home,
but you could come back later tonight.
Oh, i can't do that.
I have to study for an orgo test.
Orgo?
Organic chemistry.
I'm pre-med.
Pre-med?
Really?
Oh, hello, dear.
Andrew, get orson's plate from the oven.
Ask me how my morning was.
All right.
How was it?
After two nights of sleepless bonding with my son,
i nearly dozed off while repairing
mrs. Colby's cracked molar.
I doubt if the crown i put in will last her a year.
So you'll replace it for free.
That's not the point.
How is a dentist supposed to feel
when he can't give a 90-year-old a lifetime guarantee?
Bree, i'm sorry, but this whole family bed thing has to stop.
Oh, give it some time.
We're still adjusting, and benjamin is sleeping so soundly.
Well, he can sleep just as soundly in a crib.
From what you've told me,
you and rex didn't haul andrew into bed with you.
No, and i wish we had.
If we did, he mightn't have turned out so...
So what?
Stupid?
Lazy?
Short?
I was going to say angry, and perhaps
that anger began when we exiled you to the nursery.
I'm just trying to learn from my mistakes.
So i'm--i'm what, like the first pancake?
Don't be so sensitive.
We'll find something to help you sleep--
maybe some warm milk.
I know something that used to help me sleep.
Of course, that's off the menu these days.
Could the mistake have the salt?
D if you're as tired as you say you are,
then you're bound to sleep better tonight.
Yes, i will, because i'll be sleeping in the den.
You're leaving our bed?
Darling, i need to either sleep or get lucky tonight.
I'll have a better shot at both if i'm alone.
Gosh, you're studying to be a doctor.
That must not leave you a lot of free time for hobbies or...
A girlfriend.
Well, i have the time.
I just don't have the girlfriend.
Well, no rush.
You know, just yesterday, i was telling my daughter julie--
oh, you know, that is so rude.
I-i'm talking about daughter,
and you don't even know what she looks like.
That's her.
She's cute.
Oh, barrett, i wasn't fishing for compliments.
If i was...
I would've shown you this one.
Oh, excuse me.
I'm sorry.
I gotta take this.
Oh, sure.
I have to check on the laundry.
Yeah?
No, bonehead, i don't sell that stuff.
Just pills, smokes and 'shroomage.
That's it.
20 bucks, cash only.
Meet y at the dorm.
Look what i found on the dryer.
Julie won second place in the state science fair.
That's awesome.
Yeah, good-looking and smart.
Only problem is, where is she gna
find someone else like that?
Well, i gotta get going.
My study partner's giving me
a harde about that test, so...
Oh, that's okay.
You know, why don't you come back tomorrow to see me,
and if julie happens to be here,
maybe you can give her some advice on
picking out colleges and stuff.
Yeah, sounds great.
See you tomorrow, mrs.Delfino.
Oh, please, call me "mom.
"uh, because...
That's what all the kids call me.
Oh, thank you.
Hey, bree.
Table for, uh, one and a half?
No, thanks.
I'm just dropping off andrew's cell phone.
He forgot it again.
Okay.
I'll give it to him.
Um, tom, may i ask you something?
Did you and lynette do the family bed
when your children were babies?
Well, it wasn't exactly a choice.
They just kept crawling in there.
So, um, not to pry, but, um, did that create any,
uh, issues for you?
You mean sex?
Apparently, "not to pry" wasn't necessary.
Well, it did put a crimp on things at first,
but that just forced us toe more creative.
Again, not to pry, but-
the office.
We did it at the office, once in the car,
and you remember when youasked us to wa
when you guys were going out of town?
Okay.
Thanks.
Yes, um, we'll be going now.
Hey, other than your issue,
how does orson like being a dad?
Oh, he just adores it.
The three of us are such a happy little family.
Aren't we?
That is great.
Bye.
Bye.
I replaced the gasket
Shouldn't leak anymore?
Great... Why don't you
grab us a couple beers?
Sylvia.
What are you doing here?
Beautiful house.
Look, you need to leave.
I don't want katherine finding you here.
Oh, but katherine's gone.
I waited until she drove away so we could be alone.
Aren't you gonna invite me in?
After you ruined my life?
I don't think so.
You ruined your own life.
You should have told the truth about us.
Sylvia, why don't you do us both
a favor and go back to chicago?
Adam, let me in.
Hey, man.
Your, uh, your beer's getting warm.
Oh, you have guests.
Well, i guess i'll just drop by some other time.
I'm sorry, man.
It just sounded like you needed a little help.
Thanks.
That's, um, a-an ex-patient...
With some pretty serious mental problems.
Uh, could you do me a big favor?
I'd rather katherine didn't know she was here.
Yeah, that's no problem.
You know, actually, i was gonna ask you a favor, too.
I've got this pain in my shoulder.
You--you think you could write me a prescription?
Oh, i wish i could help you out,
but a gynecologist writing a prescription for a man?
It kind of raises a red flag.
Ah, don't worry about it.
This favor tng doesn't have to go both ways.
Linda, is mrs.Zimmerman here?
Hello, doctor.
Bree.
What a wonderful surprise.
Uh, i've got a new patient coming in.
Mmm, yes, you do.
I'm mrs.Zimmerman.
Uh, your message said you had
a cavity that needed filling?
I was in a very naughty mood when i left that.
You're waiting outside.
Why are you waiting outside?
Everything is fine.
It's just, um, someone's here.
Oh, my god.
It's the police?
No, no.
No, nothing like that.
It's your stepfather.
Glen?
I don't believe it.
Lynnie.
Oh, it's been a long time.
Oh, god.
Only three decades give or take a year,
but who cares?
Oh, gosh.
You look great.
Oh, so do you, although
what--what--what's this?
Oh, just a little cancer.
No, but i kicked its ass.
I'm good now.
You come here.
Oh!
So why--why are you here?
Well...
Your mother called me.
She did?
Is she okay?
Uh, she sounds fine.
She asked for money.
I didn't know you guys had kept in touch.
well, we had.
I'm meeting her at fairview park to give it to her,
and i'm guessing you'll want to come with me.
Yes, yes, thank you,
but where has she been staying?
She broke into a car and
spent the night there.
Oh, my god.
But she did say it was a cadillac.
Oh, well, good.
At least she's not living like a hobo.
Oh, my god.
I'm so glad to see you again.
Oh, you, too, lynnie.
Hey, bree.
Hello, adam.
I just dropped by to see your husband.
Is he here?
He's in the exam room, readjusting the chair.
Look, i'm sorry mike is in such pain,
but it's not really ethical for me to
write him a prescription.
Know it's a little dicey,
but you'd really be doing me a big favor.
By the way, bree looks great.
I haven't seen her since i
delivered danielle's baby.
Sorry.
Your baby.
Hey, andrew.
What are you doing?
Just giving you that sewing room you always wand.
You're moving out?
But you can't afford an apartment.
I can afford this one,
which will give you some idea how
crappy the neighborhood is.
I'm sorry.
I don't--i don't understand.
Why are you doing this?
I'm doing this for you.
How are you gonna get a fresh start with
your past mistakes stinking up the place?
Is this about the other morning?
Oh, for heaven sakes, you can't be serious.
I am.
In fact, i already gave the landlord a check.
So i hope the three of you are very happy.
Well, to be honest,
i'm not entirely comfortable
giving this to you, mike.
Pain medication only helps
your symptoms.
If this is chronic, you need to be
seeing a physical therapist.
You know what i need, orson?
I need to take a few weeks off,
but i can't,
'cause i've got to work...
For the baby, for julie's class trip,
the patio furniture
and everything else susan's
got me paying for.
Are you okay, mike?
You sound a little unhappy.
No, no, i'm happy,
and i don't mean to put all
of this on susan.
It's just, when i signed up
for this suburn dad thing,
i didn't exactly know what i
was getting myself into.
No, i understand.
Still, this is no way to deal with stress.
It's not about stress.
It's about the pain i've been in every day
since i got hit by that car.
You mean this pain is related
to your accident?
It wasn't an accident.
Some son of a bitch ran me
down and took off.
Right.
Well, i hope this helps.
Oh, mike, you're home.
I was dreaming we were ponies.
That's nice.
Go back to sleep.
Hey, that kid, um,
barrett me by today.
What?
Yeah, he said that you owed
him money for some...
Plumbing job that he helped you on.
Yeah.
Yeah, i gotta get that to him.
Oh.
He's coming back tomorrow.
Don't you think he would be perfect for julie?
Barrett, it's delfino.
I'm only gonna say this once.
I'll get you your money,
but don't ever come to my house again.
You got it?
Ever.
MAYOR MISSING
Yes, hello.
I'd, uh, like to leave an anonymous tip
about something important.
Uh, do you have some kind of
voice mail menu for that?
Well, it's about the mayor.
Oh, i don't think he's missing.
I think he's dead.
Look, that's it.
We gotta go to the cops.
Carlos, please.
Look, we blew it with the fingerprints, all right?
Now they know someone else was
with him on the boat.
They don't know that someone else was us.
It's just a matter of time.
I mean, make a list of people with
a motive to kill victor.
Number one--you.
Number two--you.
Number three--maybe me, probably still you.
Okay, if we just stay lm and stick to the story...
We tried that.
It's not working.
I'm going to the cops.
Now you can either come with me or
wait for them to come and get you.
Fine.
I'll go.
Thank you.
Can we at least have a drink before we go?
Calm our nerves?
I mean, you can't talk to the cops
the way you've been babbling to me.
I guess one drink wouldn't hurt.
You okay with tequila?
Only if it's the good stuff!
Oh, i think you'll find this has a real kick.
SLEEPING AID
Oh, and this is the worst.
During a dissection, my anatomy lab
partner squirted stomach juice in my eye.
Ew.That is so disgusting.
Oh, it was terrible.
So gross.
Hey.
What are you smiling about?
My matchmaking skills.
Julie and barrett are really hitting it f.
Barrett?
Yeah, your friend.
I told you last night he was coming by again.
I appreciate all the pressure you're putting on me.
You're welcome.
Uh, julie, could you give us a minute?
Barrett and i have a little business to discuss.
Sure.
I'll just grab my jacket.
I thought i told you to stay away from my house.
But your wife invited me.
And, hey, you married into a cute family.
Kudos.
Here's your money.
Now get out.
We were just leaving.
I'm taking julie on a tour of my campus.
There is no way
I'm no going anywhere
with a lowlife drug dealer.
Lowlife?
Dude, i'm a pre-med student
who's found an enterprising way
to earn his way through college.
You, on the other hand, are a junkie,
and i don't think you want your cute
family knowing that, do ya?
I'll have her home by 10:00.
This is delicious, mrs.Delfino.
Thank you.
Hey, you know, would you like me
to pack some up for you guys to take?
This guy's a drug dealer.
What?
You remember those pills you found?
He sold them to me.
Look, mrs.Delfino--
get out of my house.
Get him out of my house!
Okay.
I'll go.
It's a shame, though.
He was such a good customer.
Hey.
Where'd barrett go?
Why am i so sleepy all of a sudden?
Oh, i don't know,
but if you're not feeling well,
maybe we should put this off.
No, no, no. We gotta go now.
Crap!
What?
Oh!
Detectives!
Any, uh, news on my husband?
Not yet, but we've got some
more questions for you.
Oh, okay.
So ask away.
Mrs.Lang, were you having an affair
with your ex-husband?
Carlos?
That's crazy.
Where'd you hear that?
Your neighbor called us.
Oh.
Well, you tell edie britt just
because carlos dumped her,
doesn't mean she has to go around
trashing my reputatn,
especially when she's the slut.
Well, have you seen him lately?
Boy, let me think
Uh...
Mm...
No.
No, i haven't.
This is lyons.
We're on our way.
Good news, mrs.Lang.
They found your husband.
Huh?
A couple of fishermen found him
washed up on the beach.
He's unconscious but in stable condition.
Would you like to go to the hospital?
Well, why wouldn't i?
Just let me grab my purse.
Well, you can stop feeling guilty.
Victor's alive, and we're screwed.
Okay, what's the plan?
Once she shows up, you'll meet her
and give her the money.
Then ask her to walk you back to the car.
I'll jump out, grab her, and while
you open the trunk...
Lynette.
Fine, the backseat, but you're just
gonna spoil her.
I see you still have that wicked
sense of humor.
Yeah.
It's the one good thing you get from
a crappy childhood.
You know, i...
I always regretted the way things ended.
Why?
Mom cheated on you.
No one blames you for leaving.
It was, uh, more complicated than that.
Hey, i'm not complaining.
Well--
ah, there's booze-illa now.
All right, i'll go get her.
He bought those pills a long time ago
and never got around to paying the guy.
Wow.
Julie, it's not like
it was heroin or crack.
It was just pain pills
for his shoulder,
but we had a talk, and he has
totally stopped taking them.
Are you absolutely sure?
Yeah.
Why?
Well, i was at the drugstore this morning,
and i saw mike there, picking up a prescription.
Hello, stella.
Glen.
What the hell?
I know we're the same age.
How is it you look
so much better than me?
Well, i don't drink or sleep in cars
oh, so that's your secret.
Who knew?
Stell, here's the money.
Thanks, doll.
You are a beautiful,
beautiful human being.
You son of a bitch.
You set me up.
Lynette!
Oh, crap!
Now where do you think you're going?
I'm off to die in a ditch.
What do you care?
Okay, ough with the drama.
I want you to come home with me.
Oh, really?
That's not what you said
to lydia and lucy.
I am sorry about that, mom.
We were just venting.
People who love you need to do that.
I was not a horrible mother.
And even if I was,
it'a all new, so drop it.
Drop it?
Do you hear that?
She wants me to drop it.
And when she cheated on you,
and when she wrecked our family,
i bet she wanted you to drop that, too.
Okay, guys--
what's done is done,
and if you can't get over it, there's nothing
i can say that'll make you stop hating me.
There is one thing you could say.
You keep your mouth shut.
Stella, she's a grown woman.
She can handle it.
Handle what?
Glen, don't.
Lynnie...
I didn't leave your mother
because she cheated on me.
I left because i'm gay.
Mom.
You okay?
Just a bit dizzy from holding my breath
in your stairwell.
May i come in?
Oh, i'd--i'd kind of rather you not see
the place until i get it fixed up.
Well, i guess i'll just have
to take my veal scaloppini and go home.
I've been so busy with moving,
i forgot to eat.
This is really good, mom.
Thank you.
You know, i'd make it for every day
if you'd move back home.
Mom, this...
This is my home.
Seriously, andrew,
you don't even have a bed.
Actually, you're sitting on it.
It's a foldout.
Oh, dear god.
At least let me buy you
some decent furniture.
Absolutely not.
Mom, i'm--
i'm gonna do this on my own.
Andrew, i understand you're angry
with me about what i said, but...
I do have a good reason for wanting
to raise benjamin differently.
I mean, let's be honest.
You put me through hell.
You're right.
I-i know i did,
but that's why i'm mad.
Because i-i changed,
and you never noticed.
You know, i-i got a job, a car,
my own health insurance.
I'- i've turned things around.
Well, i know that.
Then why haven't you said anything?
It's because you've been so focused
on your new husband and baby.
Oh, andrew.
Mom, it's okay.
You know, you've got a new life,
I think it's time to I did it too
I just don't want us
to part on bad terms again,
like we did two years ago.
You mean when you left me
on the side of that road?
Look, mom...
I was spinning out of control.
You forced me to grow up.
If i haven't said it before,
thank you.
You forgive me?
I forgave you a long time ago.
You just...
You just never noticed.
Oh, uh, mom?
Uh, would you mind using a coaster?
Okay.
Now i...
I really am gonna cry.
Dave passed away last spring.
We were together almost 20 years.
Oh.
He seems nice.
I know it's a lot to deal with.
Kinda.
So, uh, coffee's probably ready.
Uh, cream and sugar?
Shot of bourbon?
Why didn't you tell me?
It wasn't my proudest moment, lynette.
What are you talking about?
I failed as a woman.
Two years being married to me,
and he turns gay.
I don't think that's how it works.
All i know is i was...
So ashamed.
What does it matter anyway?
It wouldn't have changed
anything between us.
Are you kidding?
It would've changed everything.
Oh, y-you would've given me a pass
on my drinking and my--my swearing, my--my men?
If i understood why you couldn't stay married to
the only father, the only stable parent i'd ever known,
yeah, i could've found a way
to forgive you all sorts of things.
We can talk about this later.
Let's go home.
I don't think so.
Listen to me.
I would be honored if you would
come and live with us.
Having you around these
past few months was sort of...
Fun.
It was great.
We actually figured out a way
to stop torturg each other.
Then why not come back?
Because i don't want
to screw that up,
and let's face it, lynette.
You know i would.
So why don't we just take our chips
and leave the table winners?
But where will you live?
Actually, i have a thought.
Uh, sorry. I didn't mean
to eavesdrop, but, um...
I happen to have an immaculately
decorated guest room.
You know, he's always talked like that.
How did i not know you were queer?
I'm sorry.You want this aroun
well, we always had a good time,
and to tell the truth,
i've been a little lonely lately.
Oh.
So i would be doing you a favor.
Fine, but i'm keeping the money.
It's a deal.
Does this work for you?
It does.
It really does.
Some stretches,
and the shoulder feels great.
That's a relief.
You, uh, gonna take a shower?
Yeah.
I might, um,
go down for a snack in a minute.
Okay.
Mrs.Lang?
Uh, i'm dr.Wheeler,
your husband's neurologist.
How is he?
Uh, he's starting to wake up now.
Would you like to talk to him?
Of course!
I-i bet he's pretty delirious.
I mean, after his ordeal, i wouldn't be surprised
if he's just babbling like a crazy person!
Mr.Lang, your wife is here.
Gaby.
Hi.
Don't strain yoursel victor.
There's plenty of time to talk later.
Wh's important now is that you rest.
Just stay quiet and rest...
Quietly.
Mr.Mayor, i'm detective berry.
We need to ask you a few questions.
What time did you take your boat out?
I was on the boat?
We think.
We found it floating in the bay,
and, uh, obviously, you'd been
in the water for quite some time.
Uh, the last thing i remember...
Was friday's staff meeting.
Really?
I mean, what?
Gaby, do you remember anythi
about me being on the boat?
No.
No.
Sorry.
I guess i don't remember anything.
Not uncommon in these situations.
He's suffered both
a mild concussion and hypothermia,
either of which could
result in memory loss.
Well, who cares?
The important ing is that he's safe,
and we're gonna nue you back to health,
and i think that would happen
a lot faster if we all clear out.
Thank you.
Gaby,
can you stay with me
for a little while?
Of course.
Sounds like i was
in pretty bad shape there.
But you're okay now.
That's the important thing.
Come here.
I remember everything.
What?
I think i will rest now.
I'm gonna need all my strength.
The past is never truly behind us.
Ghosts lurk in the shadows, eager to
remind us of the choices we made.
But if we look back,
we might find an old friend
with open arms...
Or an old enemy
with a hidden agenda.
Or a grown-up son
with a forgiving heart...
Sadly, some of us
refuse to look back,
never understanding that
by denying the past...
We are condemned...
To repeat it.
Previously On...

A Visit.

Aren't You Gonna Invite Me In?
After You Ruined My Life?
I Don't Think So.
You Should've Told The Truth
About Us.
Mike Got Help...
From An Unexpected Source.
(Gaby) Victor!
Victorashed Out...
Come On! Get Up!
(Grunts)
And Carlos And Gaby...
We Need To Ask You A Few Questions.
Sorry. I Guess
I Don't Remember Anything.
Finally Met Their Match.
I Remember Everything.
(Mary Alice) It Was Supposed
To Be A Beautiful Day.
Kids Should Have Been
Playing In The Park.
Husbands Should Have Been
Doing Their Chores.
Women Should Have Been
Tending Their Flowers.
But At 2:26 That Afternoon,
A Tornado Came
To Wisteria Lane...
Bringing With It...
Unbelievable...
Destruction.
No One Could Have
Anticipated It...
Especial
Given How The Day Started.
Sorry.
Can You Say That Again?
I Don't Think I Heard You Right.
Carlos And I Are Back Together.
Gaby,
You Just Got Married.
And Some Of Us Gave You
Very Expensive Wedding Gifts.
Uh, You Want
The Fondue Set Back? Fine.
But Don't Act Like
It Cost A Bundle,
'Cause It Clearly Didn't.
I Got You The Fondue Set.
Oh. Right. It's Nice.
Oh, My God.
This Is Gonna Kill Edie.
You Would Think So,
But No Such Luck.
That Vindicte Hag Told Victor
Everything. Victor Knows?
Yeah, And Seeing How He's
The Rich Mayor Of A Small Town
With Various Thugs And Cops
At His Dposal,
Carlos And I
Thought It Would Be Safer
If We Got
The Heck Out Of Dodge.
You're Leaving Fairview?
Yeah. This Afternoon.
No.
You Can't Be Serious.
Look, We'll Be Back...
Someday.
We Just Have To Wait
Till This All Blows Over.
I Can't Believe This.
I Know. This Is...
A Lousy Way To Say Good-Bye.
And I'm Sorry,
But I Don't Have A Choice.
Do You Guys Have Any Idea
How Much I'm Gonna Miss You?
Hey, You Heard The News?
A Tornado Just Hit
Mount Pleasant,
And They Think
We Could Get One, Too.
Y'all Better Head Inside
And Start Getting Ready.
Um, Go. You Guys Go.
Yeah, And--And We Don't Need
To Say Good-Bye Anyway,
'Cause We're Gonna
See You Real Soon.
And Everything Will Be
Just The Way It Was.
Sadly, This Was Not To Be.
Oh!
In Four Short Hours,
One Of These Women
Would Lose A Husband,
And All Of Them
Would Lose A Friend.
But How Could They
Have Known This?
It Was Supposed To Be
A Beautiful Day.
By Noon That Day,
A Tornado Watch Was In Effect
On Wisteria Lane,
And Every One Of Its Residents
Was Preparing For The Storm--
Everyone, That Is,
Except Gabrielle Solis,
Who Was More Concerned About
AnotherStorm On The Horizon.
Mayor Lang,
Recovering From His Injuries,
Will Reportedly Be Released
From The Hospital Tomorrow.
Until Then, The Deputy Mayor
Will Be Coordinating
Fairview's Emergency Response
As The City Remains
On Tornado Watch.
It Has Been Over 50 Years...
I Turned Off The Gas

I'm Gonna Go Gramy Passport

...We Should Understand Is
Never Underestimate
The Power Of Mother Nature.
What's Wrong?
They Said Victor's Getting Out
Of The Hospital... Tomorrow.
Relax.
We're Gonna Be Gone
Before They Give Him
His Last Sponge Bath.
And Remember, The Accountant's

I Told You Just To Pack
The Essentials.
That's What I'm Doing.
Is That A Boa?
Carlos, If You Are
Taking Me Somewhere
Where I Don't Need A Boa,
Then I Don't Want To Go.
Fine. You Could Be
A Little Bit More Sensitive.
I Had To Say Good-Bye To My
Friends Today. Yes, I'm Sorry.
And I Should Probably Go Over
And Say Something To Edie.
Like What?
"Rot In Hell,
You Maggoty Whore"?
That Woman Ruined Our Lives.
If She Had Kept Her Mouth Shut,
We Wouldn't Be Running Away.
I Know, But I Can't Help
Feeling A Little Guilty.
I Mean, Do You Ever Even Think
About What We Did To Edie?
Who Cares?! Thanks To Her,
I'm Giving Up My Home,
My Friends,
Half My Wardrobe.
So Do Me A Favor And Never
Mention Her Name Again
Unless It's Followed
By The Phrase,
"That Conniving Skank."
YaThink You Can Do That?
Hey, Lynette.
Hi. Did You Hear
They Declared A Tornado Watch?
Scary, Huh? Yeah, Well,
Don't Worry About Me.
I'm Ready For Anything.
It's Sweet Of You To Dough.
Oh, Yeah.
Okay.
Um...
Can We Stay
In Your Basement?
What?
Well, If This Tornado Watch
Gets Upgraded To Aarning,
We're Gonna Need
A Place To Wait It Out.
"We"--Me, Tom, The Kids.E"?
That Family You've
Come To Know And Love.
All Ven Of You?
Yeah.
Well, First Of All,
I Only Love Four Of You.
And Second,
No Way In Hell.
Mrs. Mccluskey, Please?
It's A Small Basement,
Lynette.
I've Already
Invited Ida Over.
We Just Wanna Play
Some Cards
And Wait This Thing Out
In Peace And Quiet.
We Can Be Quiet...
Relative To The Storm.
Look, There's A Shelter
Over At 3rd And Grove.
Why Don't You Go Over There?
That's In The Middle Of Skid Row.
You Think I Want My Kids
Around A Bunch Of Winos?
Ida's Off The Wagon. It's Not
Gonna Be Much Better Here.
I Am Asking You As A Friend.
Please?
(Sighs) You're Not Gonna
Let This Thing Go, Are You?
Thanks. And Don't Worry.
I'll Have A Talk With My Kids.
I Promise They'll Keep A Lid
On The Destruction.
Relative To The Storm.
Yeah. Mm.
Dylan, We're Fine.
It's Just A Tornado Watch.
No. We Paid A Lot Of Money
For This Class Trip,
And I Want You
To Stay And Enjoy It.
Tell Julie
I'll Keep An Eye On Her Mom.
Gotta Go.
What The Hell
Are You Doing Here?
I Just Came To Talk
To Adam.
I Like Your Hair Long.
This Is Harassment.
I Will Call The Police.
I Don't Think So.
You'd Have To Tell Them
What Happened
With Me And Your Husband.
You Don't Want People
Knowing About That.
In Case You'd Forgotten,
Adam Wants
Nothing To Do With You.
Oh?
Didn't Seem That Way
Yesterday.
He Didn't Tell You
I Stopped By?
I Hope He's Not Starting
To Keep Things From You...
Again.
Here. I Brought You A Few Things
In Case ThereIs A Tornado.
(Chuckles) Wow.
Tape, Batteries, A Radio.
How'd You Know
I Need This Stuff?
An Educated Guess.
Hey, Actually, Um,
Since You're Here,
I Was Thinking That Maybe
It Would Be A Good Idea
To Tell Orson About Mike's,
You Know...
Drug Problem.
Good, Because I Already...
Told Him.
You Did? When?
Last Week.
I Was Afraid That Mike
Might Go To Orson For Pills.
I'm Sorry, So...
Orson Already Knows
About Mike?
Did I Do Something Wrong?
No. No, You Didn't
Do Anything Wrong.
Thanks For The Supplies.
I Don't Believe
A Word You Say.
So You Still Don't Think
I Slept With Adam?
Of Course Not. Oh, Well,
Let Me Paint A Picture For You.
Me Lying In His Arms,
Him Wondering Out Loud
How He Ended Up Marrying
Such A Cold, Hard Bitch.
Katherine,
Are You All Right?
I-I Couldn't Help
Noticing--
Of Course You Couldn't.
And Everything's Fine.
Thank You.
Hi There.
I-I Don't Mean To Intrude,
But Are You All Right?
Not Really, No.
Would You Like
A Nice Cup Of Tea?
The National Weather Service
Has Extended The Tornado Watch
To The Tri-County Area.
Funnel Clouds Have Been Spotted
In The Counties
Of Mansfield And Webster...
I Can't Believe
You're Being So Nice.
You Don't Even Know Me.
Well, I Know Katherine,
And Believe Me,
You're Not The Only Person
I've Seen Her Reduce To Tears.
Did You See Her Spit On Me?
Yes. That Was Unfortunate.
If You Need
Any Antibacterial Soap, I--
Nah, I'm Good.
So, Um, Why On Earth
Would Katherine Treat You
So Dreadfully?
Oh, She's Just Mad 'Cause
Her Husband's In Love With Me.
Really?
I Was One Of His Patients
Back In Chicago.
From The Moment We Met,
There Was
ThisIntense Passion.
We Tried To Fight It,
But We Couldn't.
Well, You're Only Human.
I Know He's Miserable
Without Me,
Even Though She Tries
To Pretend That They're Happy.
I Mean, You're Their Neighbor.
You Think They're Happy?
Well, They Seem...
Content.
Well, They're Not.
It Was Just
An Observation.
Yeah, A Stupid One.
Okay. (Chuckles)
This Has Been... Lovely.
We Really Should, Um,
Do It Again Sometime.
You Think
I'm Making This Up?
We Were Lovers.
I Can Prove It.
He Has A Snake Tattoo
On His Right Shoulder.
I Licked It.
Be That As It May, I Really
Think You Should Go Now.
No One Believes Me!
She Has You All Brainwashed!
Sylvia,
Whe Are You Going?
Sylvia, You Need
To Come Out Of There.
Ask Adam! He'll Tell You The Truth!
Ll, Adam Is Not Here,
And There Is A Tornado Coming.
And As You May Have Gleaned
From The Batteries
And Bottled Water,
That Bathroom Is Where We Are
Planning On Riding It Out.
So Would You Please Be A Dear
And Come On Out?
Go Get Adam!
And... Open Wide.
Orson, We Need To Talk.
(Drilling Stops)
Susan. I'm With A Patient.
Yeah, I Can See That.
Hi. I'm His Neighbor.
Cute Shoes.
Why The Hell Would You Give Mike Drugs?
Uh...
Mrs. Kowalsky...
(Clears Throat)
We're Gonna Step Out
For Just A Moment.
No Need. I'll Be Quick.
'Cause I'm Sure You Have
A Very Good Reason
For Giving Mike Pills
When You Know
That He Has A Drug Problem.
So... What Is
Your Very Good Reason?
Okay, This May Take A While.
You Might Want To Spit.
Mike Was Having A Lot Of Pain
With His Shoulder.
Oh, Of Course, And You Know
All About Shoulder Pain...
Being A Dentist.
I Thought I Was Helping.
By Giving Pills
To An Addict?
Does That Sound Helpful
To You, Mrs. Kowalsky?
Ank You.
Finally, Some Sanity.
Susan, You Have To Leave.
Fine.
But You Know, If I Find Out
That You Have Given Mike
So Much As A Breath Mint,
Trust Me, There Is Not Enough
Novocaine In This Office
To Numb The Pain
I Will Inflict On You.
Hi, Miss Britt.
You Need Some Bottled Water
Before The Storm Hits?
Well, Thanks, Jeremy.
20 Bucks.
Hold It.
You Are Price Gouging
Right Before A Tornado?
I Was Just Trying
To Make So Money.
You Really Wanna
Make Some Money?
Go Hit Up Gabrielle Solis.
She Hasn't Met A Price Tag
She Didn't Like.
I Already Tried.
She And Mr. Solis
Are Moving.
Moving?
Yeah. They're Loading Up
Their Car And Everything.
They Didn't Tell You?
Well, They Probably Didn't
Want A Big Emotional Scene.
Too Bad.
What Was I Supposed To Do, Mike?
Leave 'Em In Your Truck?
I'm Not Gonna Sit Back And
Watch You Spin Out Of Control.
Out Of Control? Have I Ever
Missed A Mortgage Payment? What?
Or Disappeared For Days On End,
Or O.D.'D In An Alley?
No. I Go To Work Every Day.
I Help Out Around The House.
I Take Care Of You And Julie.
What's The Problem?
What's The Problem?
Let's See. You Lied To Me.
Uh, Your Drug Dealer
Almost Dated My Daughter.
You Lied To Me Some More,
And Then I Find Out That You
Hit Up My Best Friend's
Husband For More Pills.
You're Blowing This
Out Of Proportion.
And You're Kind Of Yelling
At Me--Also A Problem.
I'm Sorry. I'm In Pain.
You Might Think
You Have Things Under Control,
But They're Only Gonna
Get Worse...
And With A Baby On The Way.
I'm Sick Of Explaining Mysel
If I Need A Pill Now And Then,
I'll Take One.
So Where Are They?
I'm Serious, Susan.
Give 'Em To Me. Forget It.
Hey, Don't Walk Away From Me!
Susan! Let Go Of Me!
My Wife Needs To Be Seen
Immediately.
She's Pregnant.
She Fell Down The Stairs.
Any Bleeding?
Uh, No.
Cramping?
Uh, I Think I Just Twisted My Ankle,
But I Would Like To Get
Checked Out Anyway. Sure,
But For Non-Emergency Cases,
It's Gonna Be A Long Wait.
Well, She's Pregnant. Doesn't
That Make It An Emergency?
Sir, I'm Sorry.
You're Just Gonna Have To Wait.
It's Okay.
How Could You Not Have Told Me Sylvia
Was Here? I Was Trying Not To Upset You.
Well, You Failed.
At Least If You Had Warned Me,
I Wouldn't Have Been Blindsided
When She Showed Up On Our Front Lawn.
I'm Sorry.
Look, I'll Call The Police.
I'll Get A Restraining Order.
I'll Do Whatever It Takes To
Get This Woman Out Of Oulives.
Bree. Hello.
Hi, Katherine.
Could I Borrow Adam
For A Second?
I Have A...
Situation On My Hands.
She's Over There,
First Door On The Left,
And Please Hurry.
What Is She Doing There
In The First Place?
I Saw Her Weeping.
I Wanted To Help.
You Wanted Dirt, And I'll Bet
She Told You Plenty.
I Can't Help Having
A Sympathetic Face.
Sylvia? I Need You
To Come Out Here, Okay?
Adam?
Is That You, Darling?
Don't Call Him That!
Katherine?! I'm Not Coming Out
If She's Here!
I'm Not Leaving You Alone
Withhusb
Just Come Out!
I'll Get Rid Of Her!
Ladies.
So What'd She Tell You?
That She Had An Affair
With Adam.
Well, She Didn't.
She Was His Patient--
A Pathetic, Lonely Woman.
One Day, For No Other Reason
Than Sheer Pity,
He Gave Her A Little Kiss.
Sylvia Took This To Mean
That They Were In Love.
And When Adam Told Her
Otherwise,
She Had A Breakdown
And Accused Him
Of Sexual Assault.
Oh, My God.
What Did You Do?
We Settled Out Of Court.
I Wanted To Fight It,
But Adam Was Afraid
Of Losing His License.
Of Course,
We Lost Everything Else--
Our Home,
Our... (Chuckles) Savings
And Our Friends.
So This Is Why
You Moved Back To Fairview?
It Was Supposed To Be
Our Fresh Start.
So...
Now You Know
Our Dirty Little Secret.
Well, Katherine,
For What It's Worth...
I Would've
Spit In Her Face, Too.
What's That Noise?
Is... Is That The Tornado?
Worse. It's The Scavos.
(Lynette) Hey, We're Here!
I Know!
(Tom) All Right, Guys.
Come On. Stake Out Your Places.
(Preston) This Our Spot! We Called It!
(Parker) You Can't
(Preston) Can So!
(Boys Shouting Indistinctly)
(Boy) Ow, My Head!
Lynette? I'm Begging.
Oh. Sorry.
Kinda Get Used To It.
Come Here. Give That To Mama.
(Shouting Continues)
Hey, Guys? Come On Now.
Knock It Off. Here You Go.
And... First Base,
Second Base, Third Base, Sit.
We Gonna Have
A Nice, Quiet Tornado Watch,
And Nobody's Gonna Cause Any Problems.
Is There A Cat Here?
Oh, Yes. I Brought Toby.
Is Something Wrong?
I Didn't Realize
There'd Be A Cat.
Tom's Really Allergic.
It Sets Off My Asthma.
Ida, Is There Any Chance
That We Could
Put Little Toby Upstairs?
Upstairs?
Yeah. He'd Be Very Safe.
We Could Put Him In A Closet.
Sure.
Why Don't We Put Penny With Him,
Since It's Safe?
(Chuckles) What?
Toby Is Ida's Baby, Lynette.
No, Toby's An Animal,
And My Husband, A Human Being,
Will Get Very Sick
If He Stays Down Here,
So, Please,
Put The Cat Upstairs.
Look,
I Invited Ida To Come Here.
You, I'm Doing A Favor For.
If You're Not Happy
With The Accommodations,
You're Free To Leave.
Hey,
I'll Just Stay Over Here.
(Chuckles) May--Maybe It Won't
Get Any Worse.
No, That's Ridiculous.
Karen, Come On.
Sorry. Theat Stays.
Knock Yourself Out.
(Man) Start Him On I.V. (Woman)
I'll Be With You In One Minute!
Are You Okay? Yeah, Yeah, I'm Fine.
I'm Just Worried About You.
How Long Are They Gonna
Keep Us Waitin'?
Are You Sure That's All It Is?
(Scoffs)
Hey! Hey, We Were Here
Way Before These People.
Sir, They're Seeing Everyone
On An Emergency Basis.
This Woman Is Hemorrhaging.
Danny, Can You Take Her In?
What, You Gotta See Blood
Before You'll Treat Somebody?
My Wife's Pregnant, And She
Fell Down A Flight Of Stairs.
I'm Sorry, But I'm Gonna
These People Are Bleeding. I Can
Absolutely Wait. I'm Just Asking Them
Hell, You Could've Done It
While You're Standing Here
Talking To Me, Right? Sir, We'll
Get To Your Wife As Soon As We Can.
Now Please Take A Seat.
Just Take A Look At Her!
Get The Hell Off Of Me!
Mike, Stop!
Whoa! Uhh!
I Need Security Here Now.
Hey.
When You Gonna
Let Me Out Of These Things?
When Your Wife's Done
And You're Ready To Go Home.
The Doctor
Said The Baby's Fine.
Oh, Thank God.
Yeah.
And, Uh, Your Ankle?
Just A Mild Sprain.
How You Doing?
I've Had Better Days.
I Am So Sorry.
It's Gonna Be Okay.
I Talked To The Doctor,
And,M,
They Have A Rehab Facility
Thanks.
I Don't Need Rehab.
I Can Kick This Myself.
I've Done It Before.
You Keep Saying That,
And It Just Keeps Getting Worse.
Susan, Look At Me.
I'm Handcuffed To A Chair.
I Think
I've Hit Bottom Here.
I Will Fix This.
Just No Rehab.
Mrs. Delfino?
The Doctor Asked Me
To Give You These, For The Pain.
Oh, My God.
Are You Kidding Me?
I've Kind Of Had
A Rough Day Here.
No.
(Whispers) Susan...
(Normal Voice) I've Just
Gotta Get Through Is.
No.
There's No Tomorrow.
It's Now.
You Will Quit This Now.
You Will Go To Rehab,
Or So Help Me, I Will Leave You.
I Will Take This Baby,
And I Will Leave You.
You Win.
I'll Go.
Gabrielle?!
Excuse Me?
Sorry. I'm In A Rush.
My Wife's
Alone With The Kids,
And I Have To Get Home
Before The Storm Hits.
This Is The Information
Carlos Asked For.
About What?
About
The Cayman Island Account.
Didn't He Tell You
I Was Coming?
Yeah, Of Course He Did.
Uh, He Said
You'd Be Stopping By.
Duh.
This Is Everything You Need
To Access The Money.
I Washed My Hands Of This,
So Whatever You Do,
Don't Lose That Folder.
Got It? Believe Me, I Won't
All Right. Nice To Finally
Meet You, Gabrielle.
You're Just As Pretty
As Carlos Said You Were.
Oh, No.
I'm Prettier.
Edie,
What Have You Got There?!
Oh, Crap!
Residents Are Advised
To Seek Shelter At Once.
Again, Do Not Evacuate.
Stay Where You Are
And Seek Shelter In A Basement
Or Any Windowless Room.
You Okay?
My Throat Is Closing Up.
I Think I Gotta Go Upstairs.
No. No, No, No, No, No.
You Stay Here.
Edie, You Thief!
Open This Door Now!
I've Called The Police!
They're On Their Way,
And They Are
Going To Taser Your Ass!
Oh!
Gaby?
Oh, Good. You're Home.
Lynette! What--
What The Hell
Did I Tell You?!
I'm Not Gonna Sit And
Watch My Husband Suffocate.
Well, I Don't Want Ida To Wake
Up And Find Her Cat Missing.
Karen, After All Our Years
Of Friendship,
How Can You Choose A Cat
Over My Husband?
You Think We're Friends?
Of Course.
Really?
You Ever Stop By Just To Say Hi
Or Invite Me For A Cup Of Tea?
Ida Does.
What Are You Talking About?
I Had You Over For Lemonade Last Week.
While I Was Drinking It,
You Went To The Store,
And I Watched The Kids
Face It.
The Only Time We're Friends
Is When You Need Something. That Is
Not True. I Genuinely Care About You.
You Mean Like Today,
When You Came By To Check On Me?
Oh, That's Right,
You Only Wanted A Basement,
(Meows Loudly)
Damn It, Toby!
Hey, Hold It! Hold It!
You Can't Go Out There!
That Stupid Cat Is The
Only Family That Ida's Got!
Now This Is What Friends Do!
Karen!
Give Me The Damn Folder, Edie!
(Singsong Voice) Not Gonna Happen!
It's Worthless To You!
(Normal Voice) Oh! You And Carlos
Are Screwed Without It, And That Is
Worth A Lot To Me. Give Me My Money!
Ah! (Scoffs)Your Money?
Carlos Embezzled It.
Oh, Now You're Moral
All Of A Sudden?
You Didn't Care Where
The Money Was Coming From
When Youhought Carlos
Was Gonna Spend It OnYou!
Okay, I'm Not Unreasonable.
Cut Me In For, Say, 60%,
And I'll Go Away.
How's That Sound?
No! (Growls)
Aah!
Get You!
Aah!
Edie!
Give Me That!
No! Let Go!
No, You!
Let Go!
You! Aah!
Oh! Oh! No!
No!
Wh Did You Do?!
What Did You Do, Edie?!
Get In The House.
Now!
Toby!
Toby.
Karen!
You Gotta Get Inside Now!
He's Right There!
Damn It!
I'm Not Gonna Let You Die,
So Don't Make Me Drag You!
Oh, Crap.
Oh! Hurry!O! Go!
No!
Come On! Come On!
Come On, Come On!
Get In!
I Have A Crawl Space.
(Loud Bang)
I Think We Can Both Fit.
You Just Threw My Money
In A Tornado.
I Am Not Getting In There
With You.
Fine! Then Stay Out There
And Die.
Move Your Ass!
Oh!
Come On, Sylvia.
Please Open The Door.
Sylvia.
Thank God You're Here. We Need
To Get Into The Bathroom.
We Can't.
There's A Woman In There.
Well,
Tell Her To Hurry It Up.
No, No, No, She's Barricaded
Herself In There.
She's A Patient Of Mine
Who's Had A Little Meltdown.
Just Give Me Five Minutes. We Don't Have
Time. There's A Funnel Cloud Out There.
Sylvia!
Open The Damn Door!
Go To Hell!
Quick! In Here, In Here.
Come On.
Quickly. Quickly.
Come On! Hurry Up!
Go! Get In, Get In!
Get In!
Uhh! Hang On!
Hang Onto This!
Can I Say Something?
What?
I'm Sorry
Carlos And I Lied To You.
I Know We Hurt You,
And I Wish It Didn't Happen
The Way It Did,
And I-I Just Want You
To Know That.
Why Are You Talking
Like That?
Well, I Thought
Just In Case We--
Oh, No, You Don't.
You Just Shut The Hell Up.
We're Not Doing
Deathbed Confessions Here.
We're Gonna
Get Through This.
I'm Gonna Go On Hating You
For Years To Come.
You Really Hate Me?
Yes.
(Sighs) No.
(Sighs) It's Just That
I Really Let Myself
Fall For Him,
Which Was Stupid
Because I Always Knew
That He'd Go Back To You.
Oh.
Well, I'm Still Sorry,
Though.
(Softly)
I Said Shut The Hell Up.
I Think It's Possible
Benjamin Might Need Changing.
That Went Beyond
The Hypothetical
A Good Ten Minutes Ago. We're Giving You
Shelter. You Could At Least Be Gracious.
We Wouldn't Need Shelter If
Oh, So Now It's My Fault That
That Lunatic Commandeered
Our Safe Room?
If You Hadn't Been Dying
To Know Our Business,
She Wouldn't Have Gotten In There.
Can We Stop Pointing Fingers?
This Isn't Bree's Fault.
You're Right.
Sorry.
But You Can Understand Why
I'm Upset,
Having That Insane Woman
Back In Our Lives.
I Can Only Imagine.
I Had To Listen To Her
Babble For An Hour.
What Kind Of Things
Was She Saying?
She Said That She And Adam
Were Lovers
And She Could Prove It Because
He Had A Tattoo, And...
What?
She Said He Had A Tattoo
On His Shoulder,
Which I Know Isn't True Because
I've Seen Him At The Pool,
And I Would've Remembered
Cause Tattooed People
Make Me Very Uncomfortable.
Did She Say What Kind
Of Tattoo It Was?
Um... A Snake.
What's The Difference?
He Doesn't Have One.
He Did...
Back In Chicago.
He Had It Removed.
Oh.
Sorry.
Katherine...
So... That's Why We Settled?
Why We Lost Everything?
I'm Sorry, But You Have
To Understand--
No, I Do Not.
Sorry.
(Whispers) Not Here.
Not Now.
Gaby!
Change Of Plans!
We Gotta Get
In The Basement Now!
Gaby?
(Sighs)
Damn It. Where Are You?
Where's Gaby?
I Thought She Was With You.
I Don't Know Where She Is.
I Guess We'll Have
To Wait For Her Together.
(Sighs) Do Youind
If I Say Something?
Look, Gaby And I Never Planned
To Get Back Together, Victor.
We Tried To Keep Away
From Each Other.
We Really Did.
But... I Don't Know.
It's Like We're Two Halves Of
The Same Person Or Somethin'.
And When We're Apart, W...
We Just Aren't Happy,
Which Is Why We...
We Never Set Out
To Hurt You, Victor,
And I'm Sorry We Did.
Are You Done?
Yeah.
Come On, Carlos!
You Better Get In The House!
You Could Get Hurt Out Here!
Adam!
Hello!
Where Is Everyone?!
Did You Hear That?
Adam, I'm Leaving!
This Is Your Last Chance
To Come With Me,
Or I'm Gonna Tell Everyone
Exactly What Happened!
Okay.
You've Made Your Choice!
Here I Go!
Aah!
It's Here.
It Was Supposed To Be
A Beautiful Day.
But Then The Winds Came
And Changed Everything...
And Not Just The Houses
And The Lawns.
Oh, My God.
The People Had Changed, Too.
While The Storm Had Raged,
Each Of Them
Had Learned Something...
About Friendship...
And Forgiveness...
And Redemption.
And Some Had Learned
The Hardest Lesson Of All...
That Life Is Always Fragile
And Very Often...
Unfair.
Oh, My God! Oh, My God!
Tom! Help Me!
Help Me, Tom!
Previously on Desperate Housewives...
the accountant's dropping off the
papers for my cayman island account.
This is everything you
need to access the money.
Edie got an opportunity...
But lost it.
mike...
you will go to rehab, or so
help me, I will leave you.
Made a promise.
I'll go.
I keep thinking about
what we covered up.
Katherine's aunt was determined
to reveal the truth...
and victor...
Was a victim of the tornado...
That brought devastation...
oh, my god!
to wisteria lane.
once the tornado had passed, it began.
A man gave his coat to
a stranger in need...
a woman shared her food
with those just passing by...
a teenager reunited a dog
with its worried owner.
These are the things that happen
in the wake of any great disaster.
People start to perform
small acts of kindness.
they do what they can to
help, all the while knowing...
it won't be enough.
why is it taking so long?
They should be going faster.
The fire captain said
they have to go slowly.
They don't want debris suddenly
collapsing into the basement.
Has anyone heard from gaby?
Uh, she went to the hospital with carlos.
He was pretty banged up, but
they say he's gonnbe okay.
Thank god.
Why can't we hear them?
If my kids are alive, they would
be yelling. tom would be yelling.
Okay, lynette, listen to me.
They are all going to be fine.
I know it.
Okay.
You really, really, really think so?
Yes, yes, I do. I do.
So I want you to go
over to those paramedics,
and I want you to let
them look at these cuts.
Because you don't want to be all bloody
when they pull your kids out of there, do you?
No. No, I guess not.
what are you doing?
What?
You don't know if her
kids are gonna be okay.
I'm just trying to comfort her.
By giving her false hope?
What do you suggest we do?
Well, you should be
saying,"lynette, this could end badly.
So you should start preparing
yourself for that now."
Edie, if you say that to lynette, so
help me god, I will wring your neck.
And I will help her.
Tom and ida and the kids
are buried under that rubble.
I mean, what is it with you people?
Why aren't you willing
to face the facts?
Because we're hoping for a miracle.
A miracle?
Maybe, just maybe, if we
stop flapping our gums,
and we start asking god to take care
of our folks, he might just help us out.
So you think a prayer circle
is going to help lynette?
Once you get to my age, you'll find it a lot easier
to believe that god really does answer prayers.
So if you can just hang on two more years...
don't.
You know, maybe a moment of silence
wouldn't be such a bad idea.
Hey, guys! We got someone!
Mom!
Mom!
mom!
Mom!
oh, my god!
Come on, tom.
straight ahead, sir. Go
ahead.Right over there.
Oh, my god.
Where's ida?
Tom! Where's ida?
Yes, in the wake of a great tragedy,
people do what they can to help...
all the while knowing...
it won't be enough.

The morning after the tornado,
the residents of wisteria lane
began to sort through the devastation
and slowly started picking
up the pieces of their lives.
Bob hunter found part of his
fountain in the middle of the street.
Bree hodge found her lawn
mower next to her coffee table.
And kayla scavo discovered
her music box in a tree...
among... other things.
She had your address in her
pocket, but there wano other I.D.
Did you know her?
Sort of.
Her name is sylvia greene.
Is she local?
I knew her from chicago.
She was... visiting.
Okay, I guess that's all we need.
Would you like me to follow up with
you after we contact the family?
No.
so...
I guess this means it's over.
The fact that she is dead does not
change the fact that you slept with her.
I know it doesn't.
I made a terrible mistake, and
I am so sorry, katherine.
I'm sure you are.
I want you out of my house tonight.
You don't mean that.
Yes, I do.It's over.
Asar as I'm concerned, you could be
lying on that slabright next to her.
3 Days Later
come on, ida. You can
watch us pack from up here.
The things you accumulate
in a lifetime, huh?
Yeah, especially if you
never throw anything out.
so her niece and nephew are taking
all this stuff back to nebraska?
Well, the stuff that'll sell on ebay.
I'm guessing t rest will
end up in a dumpster.
What's all this baseball stuff?
There's a mitt and a jersey.
Was this her husband's?
No, that was ida's from
her pro baseball days.
Yeah, right.
Oh, you're serious?
Ida played in the all-american
girls league during world war ii.
You didn't know that?
No.
Oh, she was a superstar.
Arm like a cannon.
People said she could throw
a porkchop past a hungry wolf.
Ida?
I have trouble seeing her as the leadoff
hitter for anything other than osteoporosis.
She made the only unassisted
triple play in league history...
right here in granville field,1944.
That's why she wants her
ashes scattered there.
how did I not know this?
daddy said you were
over here. Can I help?
you realize we're cleaning, right?
We're not eating candy.
That's sweet, parker, but we've got everything
under control here if you want to go play.
No, I want to do something
nice for mrs.Greenberg.
She sort of saved my life.
What do you mean?
When the house started shaking, and
daddy was passed out by his asthma...
mrs.Greenberg made us
all go under the stairs.
But that's not where they found her.
Yeah.
There wasn't enough room for her.
She said she'd be okay in the corner.
Uh, parker, you want to help?
Ida has some ice cream in the freezer that
needs eating before it goes bad. Go on.
I know what you're thinking, but don't.
If you'd been there, it wouldn't
have made a bit of difference.
Susan, we can't thank you enough.
Opening your home to
us- it's so generous.
It's a horrible feeling to literally
not have a roof over your head,
and that smoky fleabag hotel
just wasn't safe for a newborn.
Please, this is what best friends do...
right before their friendship ends.
Why did you agree to let her stay?
How do you say no to someone in need?
That wasn't rhetorical.
Seriously, you got anything?
I know you feel guilty because
she let us stay with her once,
but don't you remember
how miserable were?
Oh, yeah. Every cup needs a coaster.
Every coaster needs a doily.
Every doily needs daily laundering.
This woman is gonna drive
me out of my frickin'--
hey, roomies.You need help?
no, we've got it under control.
Oh, and, uh,listen. Bob and lee introduced
us to this wonderful contractor,
so we won't be imposing for long.
Imposing. Who's imposing?
You can stay as long as you want.
I'm sorry. The words came out of my
mouth before I knew what I was saying.
Then stop talking, and don't be so nice.
Otherwise, she'll just
take the place over.
hey, susan, orson likes to
sleep with the window open.
Do you mind if we
rearrange the furniture?
Sounds good to me!
hello, gabrielle.
Milton. Hi.
It's a nice turnout.
victor was loved by a lot of people.
It's gonna be a very emotional day.
You seem remarkably composed.
Oh, no,no.I'm
a mess--
you know, on the inside, where the mascara can't run.
Ah, I see.
The reading of the will is today.
Is it? I'd forgotten.
I thought you'd be curious as to how much you'll inherit.
No.
I'm not thinking aboumoney today.
I'm burying my husband.
Of course.
It's just,I, uh...
spoke to the executor of the will, and I have
a ballpark figure of what you'll be getting.
Well, I guess there's nothing
disrespectful about a ballpark figure.
You're not getting a dime.
Victor showed me the photographs
of you and your ex-husband.
You broke his heart. You humiliated him.
So you'll inherit exactly
what you deserve--nothing.
Okay, I made a mista.
I'm sorry, but victor
wasn't entirely blameless.
He ignored me. He used me politically.
Oh, yeah, and he tried to kill carlos.
So I think I'm entitled
to whatever he had.
Ah, there's the thing.
You married a man from a very rich
family- the operative word being "family."
Everything's in my name... always was.
the service is starting.
I think it's time for you to go.
Go?
You can't kick me out
of my husband's funeral.
I think it's appropriate, given
the circumstances.
Go to hell.
I'll be delivering the eulogy.
If you're stilin this pew
when I reach the pulpit,
I'm going to be telling all of these
people that you are a cheating, lying whore.
See? I told you it was
gonna be an emotional day.
hello, boys.
Bob, lee, I baked you some muffins to thank
you for introducing me to walter here.
And, walter, I decided
you're absolutely right.
Dark shingles are the way to go.
Why are you all staring at me?
I'm sorry, but I'm not gonna be able to fix your house.
What?
I've just had some bad
news in my personal life.
Oh, good heavens. I hope no one's died,
which is the only
possible excuse I'd accept.
No, it's not--it's
not that. It's just...
I don't want to get into it.
Walter, I can't find a contractor now.
Everybody is booked for the next year.
I'm sorry.
Walter. Walter.
Walter,I'm begging you. Please.
I'm living like a vagabond
in a teenage girl's bedroom.
I'm sleeping under a
poster of orlando bloom.
You can't leave me.
Yeah, well, sometimes people do that.
They just leave.
This is a nightmare.
What is going on?
Walter went rough a bad breakup,
and today he found out that his
ex moved in with someone else.
Oh, for god sakes. Tell him to put on
his big boy pants and find another girl.
Who says it's a girl?
Walter's gay?
Yes.
He can build home and decorate them.
Sometimes god gives with both hands.
Well, then you just have
to fix him up with someone,
give him back his will to work.
yeah, about that- uh, most
of our friends are 9s,
and walter--we love
him- but kind of a 3.
And in the gay world,3
does not go into 9.
Well, we'll just have to find him
someone who's not good at gay math.
Well, I drove all the way out there,
and I waited for hours and then
they wouldn't let me see him.
Uh, no. They just said that
I should--I should call you.
listen, I know it's a 30-day rehab.
I'm not trying to break him out.
I'm just trying to see him.
You know what? Could you
just call me when you know?
Thank you.
welcome to heaven.
Don't talk. I'm smelling.
What is that?
Duck a l'orange.
Bree says it's making a comeback.
And our oven is making its debut.
Oh, it gets better.
She did our laundry, too.
Smell my sock.
Oh, my god! I want to eat that.
she dusts. She irons.
Oh, and she does this magic trick.
No matter where you throw your
sweater, within seconds, it's on a hanger.
This has just replaced your
birth as the best day of my life.
Oh, hi,susan. I hope you
don't mind that I made dinner.
I hope you don't mind
that I'm going to kiss you.
You're funny.
Now I need you to be
honest about this recipe.
It's a dry run for a small dinner
party I'm having tomorrow night.
Again, if you don't mind.
Not at all.
In--in fact, if you wanna do a dry run
for sunday brunch,I'm there for you.
Dinner will beeady shortly.
Oh, and, julie, I fixed the hem
on that blue skirt of yours.
It's on your bed.
My hem is fixed?
She's like the mother I never had.
Oh, oh,no offense.
Oh, none taken.
hey.
How you feeling?
Uh, not so great.
Well, they should give you
something for the pain.
They gave me this button that I can
press, but I'm trying not to use it,
'cause the drugs make me
feel a little to mellow.
was the funeral sad?
Tragic.
I found out everything victor
had is in milton's name,
and he told his father about
us, so I'm not getting a penny.
it's a good thing you hooked
up with another rich guy.
yeah...
gaby, you sound weird.
Why do you sound so weird?
Gaby.
Um, remember that day, uh...
when al was going to drop
off the account information?
Oh, my god. He didn't?
No, no,no. He did.
It's just...
remember how windy it was that day?
No, no,no. That was the only copy.
I know, but edie was trying
to steal the papers from me,
and we got into this fight, and then
the tornado just took them away.
They're gone?
Kinda.
what is that sound?
I'm texting someone.
Gaby, that account was our future.
What are we gonna do now?
Carlos, just calm down, okay?
I'm sure al has an access code or a copy or some
super nerd way to get back into the account, okay?
I know we can fix this.
Yeah.
yeah, he could fix it.
Okay.
All right, you look very
tired, so I'm just gonna go.
But I'm warning you, gaby, if
we don't find those papers,
so help me,I'M...
Hi. Um,I'm a friend of al's, and I
was wondering if I could see him.
Of course. Please come in.
Right this way.
dear al, rest in peace
oh, al.
thanks again for your help.
Well, we'd do anything for your aunt.
I hope you know what an
amazing woman she was.
Hey, did you guys happen
to find a pearl necklace?
It's the only valuable
thing aunt ida owned.
Well, actually, I have it.
Yeah, she promised it to me if
she kicked the bucket first.
Oh, really?
In--in writing?
I'll be right back.
all right, let's hit the road.
At about the rest of these boxes?
Oh, that's junk. You
can just give 'em away.
Hey, listen. Is there a good place
we can grab a bite on the way out?
Um, well, there's a great diner
right near granville field.
Isn't that- isn't that
outt that out of the way?
Yeah, you stopping there anyway
to spread your aunt's ashes?
We're kinda pressed for time.
Yeah, we thought we'd just put her
in the family plot back in omaha.
You can't do that.
Ida wanted her ashes
scattered at the field.
Yeah, I know, but that's
kinda crazy, don't you think?
It doesn't matter.
She was an amazing woman.
You should respect her wishes.
We should get going.
Hey,I-if you don't have
time to do it, I will.
Uh, you know, you're not family, so I
think that would be inappropriate.
Look, you're taking her pearls.
The least you can do
is honor her wishes.
Okay, at the risk of being bitchy,
this is none of your business,
so could you please just drop it?
Fine.
And for what it's worth, you
passed bitchy ten minutes ago.
Carter, get the urn. I
wanna get outta here.
Wait!
You'll never find it
I'll get it for you.
By the way,I'm staying at
ida's house for a while since,
you know, my house is a pile of rubble.
Oh, that's so sad.
You've got a week.
Here you go.
Thanks.
just put it in the cup holR.
Excuse me.
Are you al's wife?
I'm gabrielle lang.
You're the mayor's wife.
Of course I recognize you.
So I was shocked to hear about al.
I can't remember the last
time I was so devastated.
Didn't you just bury
your husband yesterday?
That sucked, too.
So what happened to al?
he was driving home, trying
to beat the storm,
and he ran into a downed power line...
and his car burst into flames.
Oh, sweetie, don't.
I want you to remember al
like I do- at his desk,
with a big smile on his
face, surrounded by all his files.
by the way, where are those files?
I cleared out his office.
Oh, I bet that was hard.
so where'd you put 'em?
In the garage.
Which is...
in the back.
well, look at me, monopolizing the widow.
You go mingle.
I'm gonna get you a cracker.
oh, crap.
Why do people have to die?!
Why, god?! Why?
Why? Why? Why? Why?
Oh, ank you so much for letting
us take over your dining room.
Please. Thank you for making us dinner.
Oh, you will be sending up dessert later?
Oh, sure. Just, uh,leave your trays
in the hall when you're ready.
Puff pastry?
Thank you.
Oh, here is a nice 12-year-old
scotch to wash that down with.
Uh, look, it's nice of you
to invite me for dinner,
but if you're hoping to change
my mind about doing your roof,
I'm just- I'm
really not up to it.
No. No, no,walter,
we--we just heard
about your situation
and thought you could use a
little company. That's all.
Yes, and a nice home-cooked meal.
Trust me, there are absolutely
no tricks up our sleeve.
Uh, I noticed there are
four place settings.
Is somebody joining us?
All right,I'm here.
What was so important?
What's going on?
I'm moving out.
It's been a little weird staying
in the guest room of my own house.
But I thought you and mom
were trying to work stuff out.
We are. It's just...
your mom thought it might be easier
if we gave ourselves a little distance.
Well, then why doesn't she move out?
Dylan.
I'm serious.
You can't leave me here
alone with her. I'll go crazy.
Hey, come onwe're gonna see
each other all the time.
Why does she always have to win?
Yeah,I'm thinking of
starting my trip in paris.
Todd and I talked about going there,
but now I'm thinking of doing it myself.
Walter recently split up
with his life partner todd.
They were gay.
Small world, huh?
How is it small, exactly?
Andrew is also an
out-and-proud homosexual.
He's here, he's queer, and
we're used to it.
Since when?
You know what else
you two have in common?
A love of boots.
Andrew has some beautiful boots.
Oh, I can only imagine the fun you
two would have in the boot shop.
Um, mom,I'm gonna take
these bowls to the kitchen.
Oh, thanks, dear.
With you.
What are you doing?
I'm just trying to stay out of the way
of all those sparks that are flying.
Sparks?
The man's twice my age.
Yes, but he's also- he's
got a great sense of...
okay, do you know how hard it
is to get a good contractor?
Oh, my god!
And poor walter just
had his heart broken,
so if it takes you being nice to
him to get our house fixed, then...
you're--you're pimping
me out for a new roof?
And windows.
And I am not pimping you out.
I'm simply asking you to show some kindness to a
lonely man who happens to be an excellent roofer.
Look, if by kindness you mean sex
watch your mouth.
I would never suggest that.
You can raise a man's hopes
without satisfying them.
I've done it all my life.
andrew, I haveot to get back into
my house, and you're my only hope.
fine.
For you, I will flirt, I will
flatter, and I will charm.
bless you.
And in exchange, I expect
a 60-inch flat screen tv.
Fine, and if you can get him to
come in on time and under budget,
I'll throw in surround sound.
No.
That walter guy needs to stay miserable,
because if he's not, he'll fix
her roof, and then she'll leave us.
Mom, we always knew is
couldn't last forever,
and she'll still be
here another week or two.
That is not enough time.
She just started stenciling the kitchen,
and i didn't want to tell you this, but
there is talk of an herb garden.
I've gotta stop her.
How?
I don't know,
but I've had a taste of ironed
pillowcases, and I am not going back.
oh, walter, you got a little right there.
Thank you.
Hey, everybody.
I'm sorry to interrupt, but the smell of
that apple pie just made my mouth water.
Well, say no more.One
slice coming right up.
Oh, susan delfino, this
is walter bierlich.
this is susan's house.
She's kind enough to take us in.
Hi.How are you?
All righty.Here you go.
Thanks.
oh.You're going to eat that... here?
Oh,I'm just gonna visit for a whE.
So, andrew, we miss you around here,
but I bet you love
having your own place.
Uh, yeah.It's--it's
cool.
Of--of course, it
does get lonely.
It'd be nice to have someone
stop by once in a while.
Oh, well, you'll reel somebody in.
You always do.
you should have seen his
last boyfriend--justin.
He was so hot.
You really had a thing for
the young, ripped musclboys, huh?
Um...
he did at one time, but
andrew's outgrown that.
He realized the folly
of being so shallow.
Exactly, and now, um,his tastes
have gone to the more mature,
cultured types, like, uh,walter here.
Oh!
This is a fix-up?
Well, I just--it never would
have occurred to me, you know,
because of the vast age difference.
But, hell.Why not?
Life is short.
Certainly shorter for walter.
Susan.
Oh, no,don't get me wrong.
I mean, I think it's great.
You should grab love
wherever you can find it.
Who cares if your friends
think that you're paying for it?
Oh, so why don't you take this
piece of pie upstairs to julie?
No, she's right.That's exactly
what my friends would think.
Well, then you need new friends.
Hey, listen.You know what?
You seem like a nice guy,
and it would be great to
parade you in front of my ex,
but, uh,then I'd be using you.
Well, he doesn't mind.
No, parade me.
he's got a mesh tank top that
would bring your ex to tears.
Yeah, well, you know, as
tempting as that sounds,
you know,I'm just not
ready to date, so...
thank you so much for the dinner.
walter, wait!
well, I guess I'll just
bring this pie up to julie.
You.
Sit.
so is someone meeting us here or what?
Well, here's the thing.I called
the general manager to ask
if we could scatter the ashes
here, and he said absolutely not.
So how are we getting in?
Oh, lynette.
Hey, you've abetted.
Might as well aid.
Leave us.
Okay, I know that it sounds selfish, but I
did what I did because I want you to stay.
why?
I-I thought you'd want your house back.
Well, yeah, sure, someday,
but right now I just love
having you take care of me.
All the cooking and the
cleaning and the alphabetizing...
it's helping me feel like I'm
not just about to fall apart.
Oh, sweetie, you're okay.
No.
I'm pregnant,
and my husband's in rehab,
and the only reason I seem
sane is because you're here,
making my house feel like a home.
This is a conversation that could benefit
from some homemade chocolate chip cookies.
Can I have milk, too?
I'll be right back.
do you maybe want to
say something first?
Oh, uh,yeah, I guess so.
Oh.
um...
"do not stand at my grave and weep."
Um,"I'm--I'm
not there.
I do not sleep.
"I am a thousand winds that blow.I am...
the diamond glints of snow."
"I am the sunlight on ripened grain.
I am the gentle autumn's rain."
"Do not stand at my grave and cry.
I am not there.
I did not die."
That was lovely.
Let's dump her.
And try not to stand downwind.
She played third be, right?
Right.
Right, right, right.
Oh, my goodness.
Wait.Uh, sorry.
Shortstop.
Oh, yeah.
Okay.
No, it was third.
Damn it, karen.
I'm running out of ida.
okay, don't move!
Stay right where you are
and show me your hands.
okay, split up, and I'll
meet you back at the car.
Go!
Hey, hey!
Right there!
Oh!
Lady, get back here!
Come on.Come on.
Uhh! Come on!
Run, jane doe, run!
Just grab her!
Hey, stop, hey!
I got her.
Come on.
so when I finally came clean,
his wife told me she shredded anything
that had to do with offshore accounts.
She was protecting al.
so we're broke.
I'm so sorry, honey.
I-I know this is bad, but
we have each other.
We'll get married again, and
everything will be fine.
For richer, for poorer, right?
In sickness and in health.
The whole nine yards.
I'm gonna go down to the cafeteria anget us
a couple of ginger ales to toast our future.
Hey, doctor.
He's looking better
and better every day.
Keep up the good work.
You haven't told her yet, have you?
I'm working on it.
Carlos, I know you're
scared, but give her some credit.
She's not gonna leave you
because you lost your sight.
You don't know gaby.
thank god those cops let
us off with a warning.
I was this close to my third strike.
I'm just glad we gave
ida what she wanted.
It's a beautiful thing you did.
then why don't i feel better?
I don't know.
Why don't you?
Because it wasn't enough, not
compared to what she did for me.
She saved my kids.
She's this amazing woman, and I
never bothered to get to know her,
so, yeah, I sprinkled her ashes,
but it would have been nice to
do something before she was ashes.
That's a lesson we all
gotta learn over and over--
appreciate people
while we still got 'em.
Yep.
Third strike?
What were the first two?
it's a long story.
That requires a pitcher
of beer and a dark bar.
I got time for that.
What are you still doing here?
I thought you found a motel room.
I did, but I wanted to set
something straight before I go.
I'm not leaving because you want me to.
I'm leaving because
I'm walking out on you.
Oh, is that how we're gonna play this?
Fine.Whatever.
You're leaving me.
Oh, yeah, and here's why.
You blamed what happened
on your ex-husband,
and I believed you.
You told me it was all his fault,
and now I find out it was yours.
We're about even in the
betrayal department now.
In fact...
I think you win.
it had been seven days since a
tornado devastated wisteria lane,
and the residents continued to
pick up the pieces of their lives.
Some salvaged precious friendships.
Some uncovered colorful histories.
Others found challenges
they hadn't expected.
And then...
there was one girl...
who stumbled upon the truth
she'd long been searching for...
only...
to wish she hadn't.
Previously on...
desperate housewives
Bree moved in...
You can stay as long as you want.
Mike went to Rehab...
Mike went to Rehab...
I will fix this
Carlos faced a permanent illness...
She's not gonna leave you
because you lost your sight.
You don't know Gaby.
Dylan had questions about her father...
The only thing you need to know
about that man is he was a monster.
Why would you not tell me that?
And Adam uncovered a secret...
You told me it was all his fault.
Now I find out it was yours.
That one person wished he hadn't.
Katherine Mayfair was not the kind of
woman who liked to relive the past.
But when her husband Adam left her,
Katherine's life began to unravel,
And the mistakes of her youth
started to flash through her mind.
She thought of Wayne Davis,
the first man she married...
And the first time he had hit her.
She thought of how
sincerely he apologized...
And how meaningless
his apologies were...
And how she finally decided...
To hit back.
These were the thoughts going
through katherine's mind...
When her friends and
neighbors arrived...
Bearing gifts.
Well, hello there.
What's all this?
We brought you muffins.
And jam.
Okay, uh,what's the occasion?
Well, we heard you were
having a rough time.
So we just wanted you to
know that we're here for you.
Ah, so word is out that Adam's left me,
And you thought that muffins and jam
Would help me pick up the pieces.
The jam was Bree's idea.
Susan!  I wanted to bring flowers,
and I was shot down.
That's all I'm saying.
Katherine, we didn't
come here to upset you.
No, we thought that you just
might need someone to talk to.
No, you just thought you'd
get the juicy details.
No, we came here.
We wanted to help you,
to fix you lunch or clean your house.
Or offer up our own
houses for you to clean,
If that's your thing.
I'm fine, truly,
And I do appreciate your concern,
But... you know...
Okay.
I told them you weren't into jam.
Susan!
Look, I don't mean to pry,
But given what I know
about you and Adam,
I'm surprised he was the
one to do the leaving.
Well, Bree, the truth is...
I really don't want to talk about it.
I understand,
but whatever you do,
Don't keep your feelings bottled up.
You've got to let 'em out.
I'll do that.
Yes,
katherine Mayfair, was not a woman
who liked to relive the past.
But lately,
her life had begun to unravel.
And she couldn't help thinking of
all the mistakes she had made...
And especially...
The ones she had buried.

Mandy rancer ʱ: inmelae Friday
It happened once a week on Wisteria Lane
Like clockwork.
The faithful would
emerge from their homes
In their sunday best...
With their family bibles...
And their rosary beads...
And they would head off
To their various houses of worship,
Passing by a certain nonbeliever
Who had never taken an
interest in their ritual.
But on this day,
Lynette Scavo,
For the first time in her life,
Was struck by something...
Get the ball.
Something she would later think of
As divine inspiration.
We should go to church.
What?
Why? What did we do?
Ah, it's just...
We've been through a lot lately,
And we have a lot to be thankful for.
Don't you think we owe the
big guy a little face time?
Fine, fine.
We'll go to church...
Next week.
Tom...
I'm serious. What's the rush?
God will still be there next Sunday.
The Pistons,
on the other hand...
They lose today,
they're gone for good.
So I'm clear,
You can't be bothered with
saving your eternal soul
Because the Pistons have no defense?
Okay, look.
You didn't grow up going to church.
I did.
My parents dragged me to
st. Anthony's every sunday.
I've done my time.
Well, I haven't.
I have some questions
I would like answered.
And I don't know anything
about God or Jesus,
And our kids don't either.
Well,
you don't have to go to
church to learn that stuff.
Yeah, I know about Jesus.
See?
He's the guy who helps out Santa Claus.
Get dressed, kids.
We're going to church.
Mm-hmm. Right.
Orson, I don't want to be late.
Services don't start 10:30.
Yes, but I'm sure Edna Fletcher
has been there since 9:00,
Kissing up to reverend Sykes.
Is this about the
ladies' auxiliary again?
Damn right.
Bree, please,
such language on a Sunday.
I am sorry,
but I have to make sure
That he doesn't let her
chair that committee.
Well, how could he?
You plan every pancake breakfast.
You organize every bake sale.
You'd be a saint if our church
believed in that sort of hogwash.
Exactly, and all the while,
where was Edna?
Lounging around in zimbabwe
in the peace corps.
She won't let any of us forget it.
Well, I wouldn't worry.
Edna's "curing the village
of dysentery" story
Has long since lost its novelty.
Oh, Lynette. Hi.
You look pretty.
What are you all dressed up for?
Well, I decided I should
go to church today.
Yeah, Tom said the same thing.
Anyway, since you're the
most religious person I know,
I was wondering if you would
take us to your church.
I would love that.
We're... we're leaving right now.
You can follow us.
Great! Just give me a second
to sell Tom on the idea.
You know,
he was raised Catholic.
Oh, don't go Catholic.
All that standing and
kneeling and genuflecting...
I go for worship,
not a workout.
Mm. Not to mention the incense,
which smells good at first
Until you feel your
breakfast coming back up.
Okay.
Well,I'll be right back.
Oh, this is so exciting.
I'm going to church.
By the way, what am I now?
Presbyterian.
Right.
Thank you.
Thank you for coming.
Oh, shoot.
Did I miss mass?
Was it at 9:00?
Yes, Gabrielle.
9:00 mass is still at 9:00.
Oh, that's good to know.
Uh, father, can I talk to you?
Of course. I've actually been
expecting you to come by.
Why?
Well, I thought you might
need some comforting
After your husband's death.
Oh, that.
Yeah, I was a little blue,
But the good news is,I've bounced back.
Really?
Okay, this may come as
a little shock to you...
But guess who's getting married again?
And I was thinking,
Maybe you could perform the ceremony.
Is Tuesday good for you?
Uh...
Victor's only been dead two weeks.
Yeah, I know,
but I'm no good single.
Honestly, I don't know how you do it.
Well, who is this man?
Did you just meet him?
No. No, no,no,
no. It's Carlos.
Carlos? I-i didn't know
you two were even speaking.
Oh, yeah. We bumped into
each other a few months ago,
And we just fell in love all over again.
Uh, a few months ago?
But you were married six months ago.
Boy, you are just determined to
make this awkward, aren't ya?
Oh, Gabrielle.
Okay, look,
in the eyes of the church,
Carlos and I were never divorced.
Technically, the affair was with Victor,
And God smote him.
So we're good.
All right,
yes,I've been a bad Catholic.
Enough with the guilt thing.
Are you gonna marry us or not?
Fine, as long as you promise
To stay married to Carlos
for the rest of your life.
Absolutely.
Oh, but if I don't,
I promise you,
I will change religions.
Thank you.
Sorry. No, this is good.
Accountants always appreciate
it when people take the time
To develop a sophisticated
filing system.
Are you always this
sarcastic with your clients?
Nope, just my favorite cousin.
I so appreciate you helping us out.
Mike would be doing our taxes,
but he's off...
Getting better.
Mom told me.
Besides,I'm happy to have the work.
Yeah, I was sorry to
hear about your job.
You know,
ever since n.a.f.t.a.,
Corporate outsourcing has been
the bane of the American worker.
Is that right?
I heard somebody say that on n.p.r.,
And I just keep repeating it to people.
Actually, I wish I could blame
losing my job on n.a.f.t.a.,
But it really has more to do with Chloe.
My boss' daughter.
Oh, Tim.
I don't know why he got so mad.
I mean, she was 18.
Okay, so back to these receipts.
What is it about a girl
in a cheerleader outfit?
Done catching up.
All about accounting now.
Come on, Susan. You're acting
like I'm some sort of creep. No,
I know you're not.
I mean,18's legal.
I checked with a lawyer
before I did anything.
These receipts are self-explanatory.
I'd even know why I'm here.
This is the nourishment
Each soul requires to
go from acorn to oak.
And this is what should bring
us peace in our hearts--
The blessed knowledge
that God's love for us
Is as sure as the sunlight
And that it is always shining.
We only need see it.
Amen? Amen.
Now if you'll take out your hymnals
And turn to page 335.
What are you doing?
I've got a question about his sermon.
What? No. Put your hand down.
It'll just take a sec.
Lynette, please, we don't do that here.
Uh, yes, can I help you?
Hi. I'm Lynette Scavo.
I'm a friend of Bree Hodge.
And your sermon was lovely,
Especially the part about the trees.
Thank you.
But here's where you lost me--
"God's love is as sure as the sunlight."
Yes, absolutely.
There. You have your answer.
Now sit.
The reason I ask is,
there are wars all over the world,
And it seems like every month,
Some dumb-ass walks into a school
And starts shooting children.
So I'm thinking, God's love?
Not so sure.
Did she just say "dumb-ass"?
Ah, the eternal question--
"why do bad things
happen to good people?"
What you have to remember is,
God gave us free will.
Much of the evil in the world
is brought on by man himself.
Oh, Lord.
Yes, Lynette?
Okay, I give you that one.
But what about the tornado
that just happened?
You can't blame man for that.
Get the keys ready.
We'll slip out the back.
You bring up a big theological issue,
One that deserves a lot
more time to explore.
Why don't you come to our
tuesday night bible study?
We can discuss it then.
Well, sure. I'm easy. Thanks.
Katherine, Dylan,
hi. What's up?
Julie and I have a study date,
And my mom wants to
apologize for being rude...
Again.
Is this about the other day?
Yes.
You were just trying to help,
And I shouldn't have
reacted the way I did.
Oh, please.
After what you've been through,
No one is judging. Come on in.
I'll put on some coffee.
Oh, um,this is my cousin Tim.
Tim, this is the neighbors.
Mrs. Davis?
Davis?
Nobody's called me that in years.
Do we know each other?
Oh, of course you do.
That's right!
This is my cousin Timmy.
He stayed with us
That summer that he went to band camp.
Oh! Yes.
I remember.
Gosh, you're all grown
up.It's nice to see you again.
You, too. Hold it.
Is this little Dylan?
Can you believe it?
Wow! The last time I saw you,
you were pulling a wagon.
Oh.
How old are you now?
I turn 18 next week.
Really?
18?
Julie, Dylan's here!
Study time!
I'm... sorry.
That was probably a little
louder than it needed to be.
Edie, is that you?
Oh, my god. You knew it was me
Just from the sound of my footsteps?
No, from your perfume.
I smelled it the moment
you hit the parking lot.
Look, there's no reason to be pissy.
I'm here to do something nice.
Really?
I feel bad about the whole
losing-all-of-your-money thing.
Even though we know tornado--
clearly not my fault.
Um...
Anyway,i-i thought maybe this...
Would help.
It's the diamond bracelet you gave me.
It must be worth thousands of dollars.
Do you think you still
have the receipt for it?
Uh... I think I threw it out.
Oh. Well, you said it
was from cartier, right?
I'm sure they have some sort of record.
Carlos?
Actually, the box was from cartier.
The bracelet's from...
A swap meet.
Hold it.
Are you saying
That those diamonds are cubic zirconias?
If we're lucky.
You son of a bitch.
I gave you my heart,
And all you could give
me was fake jewelry?
Edie... I'm sorry.
I never thought you'd find out.
I just spat on one of your jell-o cubes.
Happy hunting.
Hey, you.
Do you know how long it's gonna be
Until Carlos gets his sight back?
Because I have a 2-word
sentence I'd like to say to him,
And there's a hand gesture
that goes along with it.
I don't know.
Mr. Solis' condition is very serious.
Serious? What's wrong?
Well...
You know, you should really
talk to the doctor about this.
I don't even think his girlfriend knows.
You mean Gaby?
I'm sorry.
I said too much already.
Oh, please don't tell
me that's your lunch.
Yeah. I'm sort of on a budget.
No, no,no.
If you're gonna give quality care,
You're gonna need some quality food.
Now I know of this great,
little french bistro.
It's the perfect place for lunch...
And conversation.
"Your father was murdered."
Wow.
I know.
Are you sure your aunt
knew what she was writing?
She was pretty sick. No, she had
it together, even on that last day.
I remember aunt Lily really
wanted to tell me something,
And then my mom just
came in and stopped her.
Does your mom know you found this?
No, and I'm not gonna tell her either.
Why give her another
chance to lie to me?
That's why I'm going to Adam.
I can trust him to tell me the truth.
I just don't get it.
I mean, why would your mom lie
about your dad being murdered?
Are you serious?
Julie...
She's the one who killed him.
Hi, babe.
I'm about to do something that's
gonna make you very happy.
Great, but close the curtain first.
Last time,
the nurse almost walked in
When you were about to- Carlos!
I have a priest with me.
Priest?
What, is there something
The doctors aren't telling me?
No, no,no.
I wanted it to be a surprise,
But we're getting married!
Father, hit it.
Dearly beloved,
we are gathered here
In the presence of- whoa, whoa, whoa.
Gaby, what's the rush?
I don't know. Just after
everything we've been through,
There's nothing in our way now.
We can finally be together.
And I really need that.
I need a happy ending, Carlos.
So what do you say?
Will you marry me?
Okay.
Holy matrimony. Bring it on.
Gaby, before we get started,
There's something that
I need to tell you...
In private.
Okay, he's gone. What's up?
Look, I haven't been
completely honest with you
About the extent of my injury.
Okay.
The doctor says...
I might not get my sight back.
For three months. Four, tops.
I-i just want to make sure
that you can handle that.
Wow.
That's... a really long time.
But for better or worse, right?
Right.
Okay, padre.
We're ready.
Let's take it from the top.
Dearly beloved,
we are gathered here in the sight of god
To join this man and this woman
In the holy sacrament of matrimony.
You're out of milk.
You want me to pick some up?
No, that's okay. It can wait.
I don't mind.
I could use a little air anyway.
Mm.
Hmm.
Mm.
Tim! Where's that milk?
Oh, I thought you didn't want any.
Uh...
I'm having a baby.
I can't give birth with brittle bones.
Go!
Bye!
Hey, church buddy.
Look what I got.
Wow, you bought a bible.
Yeah, and I'm breaking her in tonight.
Nothing like that new bible smell.
Oh, so you're...
Coming to bible study.
Yeah, and I hope the reverend's ready,
Cause I got about a
zillion questions for him.
Lynette,I-I realize
You don't have much
experience with churches,
So this really isn't your fault.
What isn't my fault?
Well, last sunday,
when you kept raising your hand...
We don't really do that.
The church isn't a place for questions.
It's a place for answers.
Yeah, but how do you get the answers
If you don't ask the questions?
Well, typically, we sit there
and let the preacher preach,
And eventually,
our questions are answered,
And no one is humiliated.
I'm sorry.
Did I embarrass you on Sunday?
Well, it's just that in our church,
People don't talk back to the minister.
Well, what if I need to?
What if that's the kind
of church I'm looking for?
Well, then maybe you should
explore other options.
I mean, if you really enjoy
talking back to the pulpit,
Why don't you try that
Gospel Church by the airport?
Okay.
Or, uh,the unitarians.
From what I hear,
those folks are "anything goes."
Hey, Adam. It's Dylan.
I waited at your hotel all day,
but you never came back.
You have to call me.
I found this note that aunt lily wrote.
Mom threw it in the fireplace,
but I fished it out,
And I have to talk to you.
Call me on my cell,
not at home,'cause I--
She doesn't know anything.
I can hear it in her voice.
But she's got the note.
Maybe a few burnt pieces.
Trust me,
all she's got are questions.
Well, I could,
um,refuse to see her.
Yeah,'cause that won't
arouse her suspicion.
No.
You are going to ask her to come here,
And then you're going to find out
Exactly what she knows
and what she doesn't.
After all these years,
maybe it would be easier
Just to finally tell her the truth.
And you would just wave good-bye
as they cart me off to jail?
She wouldn't call the police.
Seriously, I think you two
have a great relationship.
Then you have not been paying attention.
Give me a chance to get home,
Then call her and set up a
time for you two to meet.
Okay.
You know...
When you called me tonight,
I was half hoping you missed me.
Really?
I miss you.
I'm so terribly lonely.
You know I don't do well on my own.
Is there any chance we could...
Get past this,
and you could come back home?
I will talk to Dylan.
I will provide you one last alibi.
After that,I'm done.
Are you guys outta here?
Yes,I'm gonna run some errands,
And Orson's gonna take
Benjamin to the park.
Actually, I thought I might
take him to the museum.
You know how much
Benjamin loves Matisse.
Benjamin doesn't love Matisse.
He loves Purple. Oh.
Please stop trying to turn our
son into an intellectual. Mm.
If you saw how her first two turned out,
You'd understand how important it is
For me to fight the van de kamp d.n.a.
Hey, it's Tim.
It was great seeing you the other day.
Yeah, I can't stop
thinking about you either.
So listen, um
I've got the whole place to myself.
You wanna come over?
Hey, Gaby.
I heard you and Carlos
got married yesterday.
Guess this means you win.
Oh, Edie,
it wasn't a competition,
But, yeah, I guess I did.
Yeah, but I think it's all for the best.
I mean, after all,
I could have never been
The hero that you're about to be.
Hero? Why am I a hero?
Committing your life
to a man who's blind?
My god, you're gonna have
to do everything for him...
Dress him, shave him,
lead him to the bathroom,
Pray that his aim is halfway decent.
It's not a big deal.
Carlos is gonna get his
sight back in three months.
Four, tops.
Is that what he told you?
You poor, gullible fool.
What are you talking about?
I hate to be the one to tell you this,
But I talked to the nurse,
And she said that his condition is...
Oh, what's the word? Um...
Oh, yeah.
Permanent.
I don't believe you.
Call the doctor if you'd like.
And apparently,
he was begging Carlos to tell you.
No. No, no,no.
This can't be true.
Look on the bright side.
Women who are married to blind guys
Don't have to worry about
makeup or getting fat.
Are you sure you didn't
already know about this?
Okay,I'm calling Dr Dunlap.
You do that.
Oh, and by the way,
Congrats on your big win.
So how's your occupational
therapy going?
Do they still have you
scrubbing pots in the kitchen?
No, no. Once they found out
I'm a professional plumber,
I got promoted to scrubbing toilets.
Mm, well, maybe you won't mind
Doing a little scrubbing when you
come home next week. Actually,
the doctors kinda frown on that.
They encourage us to leave
that sort of stuff behind.
Well, it doesn't have to be toilets.
I mean,
it could be sinks, bathtubs.
You're making me wanna use, Susan.
This junkie thing's awesome.
Oh, I forgot. Uh, tim has some
questions about the taxes.
Do you mind talking to him?
No, I don't mind. Though I can't believe
He'd have any trouble with
your cookie tin filing system.
Hello?
Hey, uh,tim,I've got Mike here.
Do you want to talk to him?
Uh, can I do that later?
I'm sort of taking a nap.
What was that?
Is someone there?
What? No. No. Unh-unh.
No... no one's here.
Really?
'Cause it sounded like a girl.
No, uh,it...
it was just the TV.
I thought you were taking a nap.
Uh, the TV helps me sleep.
Uh, tell Mike I'll call him later.
I've gotta go.
What? What? You just got here.
I know, but this visit
was really more for Julie.
For me?
Yeah, you're going to college soon,
And I want him to tell you
about the dangers of drugs.
Scare her straight, mike.
Honey, you down here?
Yes, sweetheart.
I'm in the kitchen making dinner.
Mmm. Smells good.
It's a new recipe for beef stew.
I think you're gonna love it.
Why don't we let that simmer?
During my nap,
I had the filthiest little dream.
I was kinda hoping maybe we could...
Skip straight to dessert?
Yeah.
What do you say?
I'd say I'm one step ahead of you.
I have already slipped
into my pink lace teddy,
And I'm wearing those
whore-y pumps that you love.
Ooh, I like that image.
Where are you?
I'm right here, babe.
Ow!
Oh,I'm sorry.
I forgot that was open.
Let's do it over here,
on the table.
Can you give me a hand?
Can't. My legs are in the air.
Just follow the sound of my voice.
There you go.
I'm over here, sweetie.
Whoa! Uhh! Son of a bitch!
Ooh, I meant to move that.
Hang on. Let me just pull my
panties up so I can help you.
Okay. Here.
Let's go do it over here.
Aah! Damn it!
What the hell is going on?!
I'll tell you what's going on.
"In three months. Four, tops."
Uh-oh.
"Uh-oh" is right,
you blind bastard!
Ow! All right,I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have lied! Oh, no,no.
I think it was a fantastic plan.
I mean, there's no way I
ever would have figured out
That I was married to a
permanently blind guy!
Ow!
All right,
I just thought that by the time you did,
You'd be used to the idea,
And maybe then you wouldn't leave me.
Leave you?
Do you really think I'm that shallow?
Gaby, I'm poor and I'm blind,
And let's face it.
There is nothing about
that that is your type.
Wow.
Thanks for the vote of confidence.
Y-yes, the truth would
have freaked me out,
But I would have come around.
If you had just had
a little faith in me,
I could have proven to you that
I was up for the challenge,
But you robbed me of that chance.
I'm sorry.
Good.
To avoid future confusion,
I love you,
And I want to spend the
rest of my life with you.
Gaby, this is not going to be easy.
I know, but like I said,
"for better or for worse."
Think you can forgive me?
I'll work on it.
While you're working on it,
Mind if I dig into some of that stew?
Sure.
Ugh!
Get off that poor girl right now!
I finished your taxes.
What the hell is going on here?
Susan,I'm so sorry.
No, Katherine,
I know what you've been
going through emotionally,
So you don't have to apologize.
And by the way,
your boob is out. Oh.
You, on the other hand...
I know. I know.
I don't understand you.
Is this something you do?
You worm your way into a neighborhood
With the promise of
free tax preparation,
And then you jump on the nearest
middle-aged divorce? Hey!
It's not like that.
She came over for some drinks,
And we got to talking
and started reminiscing,
And all these old feelings
came rushing back.
Oh, nice try, timmy.
Like I'm really going to believe that.
Shame on you. Just... shame!
What do you mean,
"old feelings"?
Do we really need to get into this?
What do you have to reminisce about?
He was here for a week when he was 16.
What could you two have even...
Oh, my god,
you slept together.
Okay,
before you get some sordid image in
your head... she took my virginity.
Do you have to say it like that?
That's how I said it to every
single guy at band camp.
Shame on you!
His mother trusted me
to take care of him,
And you swoop in
Like some swooping, sex-craved...
Oh, for god sakes, tim!
Pull up the blanket!
You can't blame it on Katherine.
I knew exactly what I was doing.
I don't want to hear this.
I'm done with both of you.
If anybody needs me,I'll
be at the mall...
Buying sheets.
Good morning.
I'll see you after service.
Oh! Good morning, reverend.
I brought your favorite...
blueberry scones.
Thank you, Bree.
By the way,I'm sorry I've taken so long
To make a decision about
the ladies' auxiliary.
Oh, is that happening now?
I'd forgotten all about it.
So is your,
uh,delightful neighbor coming?
The one with all the questions?
Delightful?
I thought she annoyed you.
No, I found her refreshing.
It's like I always say.
Church is not a place for answers.
It's a place for questions.
You don't say that.
I've... I've never heard you say that,
not once. Yes, well, anyway,
I want to thank you for
taking the initiative.
New members are crucial to
the health of this church.
I won't forget you brought them...
or these.
Thank you, Reverend,
And I'm--i'm sure the
Scavos will be here soon.
Why did you just say that?
You know very well they
went to catholic church.
Which is just down the street.
I'll be right back.
Psst! Not you. Lynette.
What are you doing here?
I was gonna ask the same of you.
Why are you in a catholic church?
Because we're catholic.
Oh, please.
Mowing your lawn in a
notre dame sweatshirt
Doesn't make you catholic.
You're presbyterian now.
Come on. Let's go.
Weren't you the one who said I
should explore other churches?
I meant sample, like a buffet.
You take a little plate of everything,
And then you sit down
for the main course,
Which is across the street...
At the presbyterian church.
No. I just put 10 bucks
in the collection plate,
And I'm gonna get my money's worth.
Is there a problem?
No, no problem. Just talking to my
friend. She's trying to poach her.
I am not!
My friend's just a little confused.
She forgot that she's presbyterian
And wandered into the wrong church.
I'm not presbyterian.
I'm a free agent.
And if you're open to a little q and a,
you've got me.
Lynette, please.
Can't we just go outside
and talk for a moment?
Okay, what gives?
Well, I was at the service this morning,
And it's just not the
same without you.  Bree...
And I am... up for the head
of the ladies' auxiliary,
And reverend sykes was so impressed
That I brought a new
family into church, so...
If you don't come back, then...
Oh, then you won't get what you want?
Well, yes.
Well, forget it.
Let someone else help
you with your power grab.
Lynette!
You were the one who came to me.
You sought me out.
Yes, and do you know why?
Because out of all my friends,
You are the one who had real faith.
You had an actual relationship with God.
At least,
that's what I thought.
Lynette...
Because I have had a rough few months.
Okay?
But I know you've had rough times, too,
And I always assumed
That your faith had helped
you get through them.
I envied you that,
to be honest.
It did. It did help me.
Really? Okay. How?
It just did.
Well, that's not a good answer.
I have been through
cancer and a tornado,
And I don't know why I survived,
and so many other people didn't.
I don't understand,
and I need to.
Lynette, why didn't you tell me?
Why didn't you ask?
Oh, that's right.
You don't like asking questions.
Hey, Lynette.
Hi! There.
Just... wanted to tell you
That I'm out of the running
for the ladies' auxiliary.
I told reverend Sykes to,
uh,give it to Edna fletcher.
She was in the peace corps,
you know.
Huh. That's nice of you.
I suppose.
I just wanted to let you know that.
And also to... apologize.
Oh, you don't have to do that.
Yes, I do. You were right.
Faith shouldn't be blind.
You don't threaten it
by asking questions.
You make it stronger,
and I lost sight of that.
Well, maybe a little.
And it meant a lot that you
came to me for guidance, and...
I'm sorry that I wasn't there for you.
I want you to have faith
in me and our friendship.
Well... There are some things
that are easy to believe in.
How's catholicism going,
by the way?
Meh.
Well, if you ever wanna try us again...
Oh, well, I'm pretty
comfortable with the catholics.
They're the only ones who don't judge me
For having so many kids.
Hey.
Hey.
Okay, so I have to ask.
This thing that happened
with you and Katherine
12 years ago...
Was it an ongoing affair?
No.
No, it was just the one time,
And I think she felt pretty
guilty about it afterwards.
She told me not to come around anymore.
So you didn't go back?
It's weird. I tried to.
It was the last night of my visit.
I thought if I brought her some flowers,
Maybe I could get something going,
you know?
But when I got up to the front door,
I heard all this yelling.
...say good night to my daughter.
She is asleep. Get the hell out.
I went around to the window
Just to get a look at what was going
on...  remember? She's my daughter!
I'm her father!  And I could see
she was having a fight with someone.
I was about to rush in and help her
When I saw katherine
pick up this candlestick
And just wail on him.
He went down pretty hard.
Katherine was just standing over him
With this look in her eye.
It scared the hell out of me,
so I got out of there.
I left the next morning
And never talked to Katherine again.
So... this man...
who do you think it was?
Don't know.
I sort of got the impression
he was her ex-husband.
Does she ever talk about him?
Not really.
Mm. Have you seen him lately?
No.
Ever since I can
remember,I've had this feeling
That something's not right.
Weird dreams that don't
seem like dreams at all.
People telling me I forgot things that
I know I would've remembered.
And now finally,
I find a sentence on a piece of paper...
That could explain all of it
And prove that I am not crazy.
And the best that you can come up with
Is that Aunt Lily was losing it
And she didn't know
what she was writing?
I need the truth, Adam.
Please. Please.
The truth, Dylan... Is that...
Your mother didn't kill your father.
And she loves you more
than you will ever know.
Faith is a belief in something
that cannot be proven.
So we trust in the words of the
only father we've ever known.
We believe the promises of
the woman who shares our bed.
We rely on the example of dear friends
Who help us to be better people.
Yes, we all want to believe
in those we are closest to,
But where there is doubt,
Our faith begins to vanish...
And fear rushes in to take its place.
Previously on...
Lynette dallied
with temptation...
Are you sleeping
with my wife?
Carlos struggled
with his new life...
I am poor, and i am blind,
and there is nothing about that
That is your type.
Bree found herself
with a new rival...
Bree, that is, like,
the best pie you've ever made.
This is not my pie.
Okay, you caught me.
It's mine.
And susan made the best
of having houseguests.
Oh, and, listen,
bob and lee introduced u
To this wonderful contractor,
So we won't be imposing
for long.
Imposing? Who's imposing?
You can stay
as long as you want.
In a corridor
Of the greenwood
rehabilitation center
Is a sign.
It's there to remind patients
to be honest about the past.
But orson hodge
did not notice it.
He was too busy
thinking of s past,
Or at least the part of it
he shared with mike delfino.
Orson thought
of the night they met-
The night his mother...
Had murdered his mistress.
He thought
of the next timehey met
And how mike
began to recognize him.
He thought of his mother's fear
mike would remember too much
And her demand that orson
stop this from happening.
He thought of how he agonized,
But in the end,
Had still...
Done the unthinkable.
Orsothen started to think
About the message
he had received from mike,
Asking him to visit.
The thought
was crossing orson's mind
That mike had
remembered something-
Something dangerous,
When suddenly...
Orson. Come on in.
The time for thinking
was over.
So i-I see ty have
a tennis court here.
Must be nice to get out
And whack
a few balls around, huh?
Why don't you sit down?
It might make this easier.
I've been trying
to figure out all day
Just how
i was gonna do this.
Do what, mike?
Since i've come here, i've had
a lot of time to think.
Things are...
becoming clearer.
I'm starting to put
some things togeth.
Oh?
Well, good for you.
No, not really, orson.
When you hurt people,
You gotta be accountable.
There's no way around it.
So i have to ask you...
Do you think
you can forge me?
What?
When i asked you to write
a prescription for pain pills,
It... all i could think about
was getting my next fix.
The fact that you could have
lost your license,
Your business-All that
never even entered my head.
And i am... really sorry.
Oh.
Of course.
No need to apologize.
Wow. I-I feel
a million times better.
You know, one thing
i've learned here-
If you don't get this stuff
off your chest,
It'll eat you alive.
As he left,
Orson thought only
of his good fortune and relief,
Ignoring completely
The feelings of guilt and shame
that were rising within him.
That was the sad thing
about orson hodge...
He had no idea
Just how sick he reay was.
From the moment his doctors
had told him he was blind,
Carlos solis had worried
about only one thing-
That the people in his life
Would come to see him
as a burden.
But as it turned out,
His friends didn't mind
driving him to the store.
His neighbors didn't mind
helping retrieve his mail.
The paper boy didn't mind
Helping him find
his morning paper.
In truth,
Everyone on wisteria lane
was more than willing
To help caos
adjust to fe as a blind man-
Everyone, that is...
But his wife,
Who was
quickly starting to feel
She was the one
with the handicap.
"And in a surprise move,
the spurs announced a trade
That will send
perennial all-Star to the..."
Oh, jeez, gaby.
I asked you to please fish out
all the little carrot squares.
I did.
Well, i think you missed some.
Could you get 'em out,
please?
There you go. All gone.
Did you just use your hand?
Of course not. I us a spoon.
I'm sorry
that i'm such a handful.
I really am trying to do
the best that i can.
I know you are, babe.
And i know it's hard,
And i'm gonna try to be
more sensitive to your needs.
Now hurry up and finish.
I have to go to the store.
Could i go, too?
I'm bored.
Oh, please, carlos.
I have a million errands to run,
And i'd do it
a lot faster without you.
Plus i'm having lunch
with the girls first.
Oh, okay.
Mm. Gaby, another carrot.
Just eat them.
Carrots are good for your...
Just eat them.
Sorry i'm late. Blind husband.
You know the drill.
Oh, gaby,
i'm so glad you're here.
I was just about to tell
everyone to keep an eye out
For their invitation
to the founder's ball.
I'm sorry.
What is the founder's ball?
You all seem so excited.
It's a black-Tie fund-Raiser
that bree organizes every year.
It's a lot of work, exhausting
and completely worth it.
Especially when you get your
big moment in the spotlight.
Bree gets to present an award
To somebody who's done something
extraordinary for the community.
Ooh, i say we nominate the woman
who gives edie her bikini wax.
Ha ha ha ha.
So, bree,
I've planned a few events
myself back in chicago.
Small potatoes compared
to this, i'm sure,
But if you could use me,
i'd love to help.
That would be lovely.
It would?
Yes, of course.
Why wouldn't it?
Nobody? Okay, i'm going in.
Because you two would kill
each other... literally.
It'll start
with hair pullg
And end with detectives
taking our statements.
Remember the pie thing?
"Remember the pie thing"-
Tibetan monks
remember the pie thing.
I acknowledge that katherine
and i have had our differences,
But we have all been
through a lot recently.
And i would hope
that it taught us
To put our differences aside
and be friends,
Because that's
what's most important.
I faced cancer and a tornado,
But i'm running from this.
Hi.
Oh, my god. Rick.
Hi.
How are you?
Great, actually.
We're great.
Well, you look great.
Mm.
Oh. Hey, tom.
Look who's here-Rick.
I see that.
Table for one?
Uh, no, thanks.
I just wanted to come by
and bring you guys...
It's barolo.
I just got back
from italy.
Oh, well, that's nice.
Thank you.
Ah, what's the occasion? Or are
you just being a good guy?
I can't get anything
past you, huh, tom?
Well, i...
i've got some work to do.
Yeah, well, you know,
I wanted to come here
and tell you guys in person.
I'm opening my own place.
Uh, you must have seen it.
That's you?
On the corner?
Yeah, i looked everywhere,
i swear.
But, uh,
it was the best location.
I'll bet.
Okay, look, people like
to eat in fairview.
There's plenty of business
for both of us.
Hey, i remember you!
You ck to working here
now? Oh, no. Sorry.
Too bad.
That osso buco of yours was-
Really something.
Well, i got it on the menu
at my new place on the corner.
Come check us out.
See? Room for everyone.
Oh! Orson, you scared me.
Why are you sitting
down here in the dark?
And aren't you
a little cold?
I had to do something.
Then you came down here and you
couldn't remember what it was.
That happens
to me all the time.
Well, the baby is insisting
That i eat the last piece
of bree's triple-Chocolate cake.
If you want, we could-
Oh, my god. You're naked!
In my kitchen where i eat.
Okay,
i don't hear you leaving.
I had to do something.
Pajamas-That's something
you could do.
Okay, you're right.
You're a guest in my house-
A completely naked guest
in my house.
I should leave.
Hey.
Hey.
You were supposed
to be home at 8:00
To help me wrangle the kids
for bath time.
It's-It's almost 11:00.
Sorry.
So where were you?
You were stewing,
weren't you?
Come on.
You're upset about rick.
Look.
I'm not gonna deny
i was ticked off when i saw him.
But i'm over it.
I'm taking this
as a challenge.
We are gonna up our game.
Oh, yeah? Yep. You
know what i did tonight?
I worked on our menu.
We are gonna start making
our own osso buco.
I got a recipe
that is gonna kick his ass.
So you're really okay
with this?
Yeah, i'm great.
Look at how cute you are.
Oh?
It's growing back fast, huh?
Yeah, it's back.
Morning, susan.
Oh. Good morning.
Love what you're wearing.
Oh,
i hope this isn't decaf.
Got a big day ahead of me.
All right. We don't need
to talk about it.
Just promise me
it won't happen again.
What won't happen again?
Orson, you were naked
in this kitchen last night.
I was not.
You most certainly were.
Good morning.
What's going on?
Well, susan claims she saw me last
night au naturel. It wasn't a claim.
He was sitting rht here
without a stitch of clothing on,
And i couldn't have cake.
Oh, i think i know
what's going on.
Somebody had
a naughty dream.
Susan, i'm blushing.
No, no, no, no. No,
i did not have a sex dream.
Susan,
it's perfectly understandable.
Mike's away.
You're feeling a little lonely.
Naturally,
you'd project those feelings
Onto the nearest available
sex machine.
Oh!
You are such a scamp.
I know when i'm dreaming,
and this really happened.
Why else wou i be sponging
butt prints off my sol?
You know, susan, sometimes
i climb into a warm bath
With a romance novel.
Just a thought.
You wanna give me
a hand with this?
Lynette!
Gaby, since when do you come
to price warehouse?
I'm poor now. Remember?
I have to mingle
with the unwashed masses.
What are you doing here?
Oh, i've been unwashed
for years.
This place is huge!
Would it kill them
to have valet parking?
Gaby, people don't come here
for the amenities.
They come because
toilet paper's 3 cents a ton.
Look at all
these handicapped spots.
I mean, what a waste.
Take that guy selling oranges,
Put him in a vest,
stick him under an umbrella,
And bam!
You got valet parking.
I don't know why poor people
refuse to better themselves.
Yeah,
we're crazy that way.
I don't know why
You're complaining
about handicapped spaces.
Doesn't carlos have one
of those blue placards?
No, i think you have
to have a wheelchair
To get one of those.
No, i'm pretty sure
the blind qualify, too.
Mom, can i take some
of these cookies up to julie?
Why don't you offer some
to our guest first?
Oh, no, thank you. We have
so much ground to cover.
Now let's move on
to the flowers.
Uh, last year,
We went with a cascade
of pink and white roses.
There it is.
Exquisite.
Well, easy enough.
Let's just do that
again, then.
Next?
Well...
If you have
a different idea,
I would love
to hear that, too.
Well, i was thinking
It might be nice to do
something more unusual.
What about an arrangement
of purple lisianthus
With a spray
of dark berries?
It's interesting. I can't
really picture that, though.
Well, let me help you.
I keep scrapbooks, too.
My mom and mrs. Hodge are still
talking about that ball thing.
She wants me to be a part
of the founder's court
Or whatever they call it.
Like i want to put on
a stupid white dress
And greet people all night.
I know. It's so pathetic.
By the way, i'm doing it.
Seriously? Why?
Because i did it last year,
And it's actually kind of
hilarious and great.
It is! It doesn't sound
great. It sounds beyond lame.
I don't want this to come off
the wrong way,
But you're a buzz kill.
Julie!
Okay, you spend all of your time
cooped up in here alone,
Obsessing over
some mysterious thing
That maybe happened to
your real dad or maybe didn't.
Look, i'm not saying
don't obsess.
I'm just saying maybe
you could spare some time
To have a little fun
with your friend, too.
So this founder's thing-
It'll be fun?
Uh, these were
the centerpieces
From the vanover medical center
benefit.
The donors were blown away.
Well, they're certainly...
assertive.
My only fear is-
I know. I know.
Fairview is a bit more
provinci compared to chicago,
But i think you'll find
the people here
Have a lot more taste
than you give them credit for.
Well, perhaps i could try
something new.
Let's go
with the lisianthus.
Look at you! Pronouncing it
right the very first time.
Isn't learning fun?
Mrs. Scavo?
Uh, yes.
Is your husband home?
We're investigating an incident
involving vandalism.
Vandalism?
Porter! Preston!
Get over here!
No, ma'am. This incident
occurred two nights ago
Near your pizzeria.
Someone threw a brick through
a window of a new restaurant-
A place called rick's?
What?
We're asking everybody
who works in the area
If they saw anything suspicious.
I didn't go into work that night.
I did, but, um,
i didn't see anything.
What time did it happen? The
alarm went off at about 10:
Oh, i was home way before then,
around 8:00.
I came home early to help you
wrangle the kids for bath time.
Yeah. No, he was here.
All right, well, if you do
happen to hear anything,
Could you give us a
call, please? Absolutely.
Thank you.
Hey.
Mm. Oh, oh, hey, honey.
Could you hold back a sec?
Nope. Uh, lunch rush
I'm already late as it is,
okay? See ya.
Excuse me, miss.
Oh, hey there.
I guess you didn't see
that big blue sign.
This is handicapped parking.
I know. Primo spot, isn't it?
What? I have a thingy.
Yeah, i noticed that.
You don't look handicapped
to me.
I'm not. My husband is.
He's blind.
Well,
then that placard's for him.
Only he can park here.
And how is he gonna park a car
if he can't see?
Feeling
pretty stupid now, aren't ya?
Lady,
you got a lot of nerve.
I had to park next
to the dumpster way in the back.
Oh, don't play victim
with me.
I have to walk in heels
all day long.
You get to sit in a chair
and roll.
You did not just say that!
You know, the quicker
i can run my errands,
The faster i can get home
to my husband,
Who needs me, because that's
the kind of person i am.
W
What are you doing? Calling the cops. You're getting a ticket.
Like hell i am! Give me that. Get off!
No! You started it.
Hang it up! Ow! Get off!
Hang it up!
Aah!
Hey, hey! Oh!
Is there a problem here?
Jeez. What, is there a telethon
going on around here?
Dude,
she took one of our spots.
Bitch! I had to find
street parking.
Hey, there's a secity guard over there.
Go get him. No, no, no, no, no. Wait!
Okay, you know what?
This is getting ridiculous.
Oh, no, no.
You're not going anywhere.
Hey!
Let me go!
Hey! Hey! Stop!
Let me go!
What are you doing? Don't-
Ow!
Well, it's official.
I'm going to hell.
Hi, daddy.
Hey.
Hey, guys, would you go play
in the back for a while?
I need to talk to your dad.
Thanks.
Well...
Hey. Don't they
have soccer today?
Let me answer that question
with another question.
Why did you lie to police?
Lynette
And you made me lie to them, too,
Which brings up
another question.
Did you know that perjury is, like, this whole big thing?
I think you're overreacting.
No, overreacting would be if
i threw a brick through you.
What were you thinking?
Help me understand.
I just wento go check out how
the construction was going,
But i came around the corner.
I saw this giant picture
window that says "rick's."
And then i realize i'm gonna
have to see that guy's name
Every damn day of my life.
Then i noticed
this pile of bricks.
Okay.
I know this whole
thing with rick-
It really caused
us some damage.
I know it hurt us, but we
survived it, and it's over now.
Now that's the thing, lynette.
It's not over.
It was never over.
I don't care about
rick's stupid restaurant!
I don't even care that he
wants to steal you from me!
Of course, he would want
to steal you from me.
That makes sense to me.
I care that he made you
act like it could be done.
Oh, tom.
He changed the
way i look at you.
But...
Nothing ever
happened between us.
You have to
believe me. Come on!
I am notrying to
get you to apologize.
I'm just explaining the brick.
Oh, my god.
You thought i was
crazy, but it wasn't a dream.
You're naked!
I didn't mean to do it.
Oh, really?
You just happened to stumble
naked into my front yard?
I didn't mean it, mike.
"Mike"? Wait.
Are you sleepwalking?
Orson.
Hello?
Susan.
Did you just hit me?
Oh, dear god!
Orson, you're
staying at my house!
There you go.
I have no explanation.
This doesn't happen to me.
I don't sleepwalk.
You know, it's none
of my business,
But seeing as i have seen you
naked twice in theast week,
I think i can ask, is
something bothering you?
I don't think so.
I mean, being out of our
house has been a little weird,
But i'm very comfortable here.
Clearly.
You know, when you
were out on the lawn,
You said something about mike.
Mike?
What, uh,what did i say?
Well, it was just
sort of muttering.
Were you having
a dream about him?
No. I-I don't believe so.
Well, maybe it's because
you just saw him.
He must be on your mind.
Yeah, yeah. You know what, susan?
I
I think it's time for us to move out.
You can't. Your house
isn't finished yet.
No, the downstairs will
be ready next week.
We'll be fine.
Well, if you insist...
I think it will
be for the best.
Okay, but in the meantime, um,i
do have a teenage daughter,
So if you could...
Boxers?
Yes. Thanks.
Hey!
Come on. You've been
cooped up in this house
Since you got home
from the hospital.
Let's go out and have some fun!
No, i think i'm gonna stay here.
I don't-I don't wanna be a burden. -Carlos, i
see handicapped people out and about all the time.
In fact, i met two
feisty men in wheelchairs
Yesterday at the mall. They
were living their lives...
So it's time for
you to live yours.
Come on. Come on.
I'm just dropping
off a few letters.
You might as well
just wait here.
Just picking up some vitamins.
I'll be quicker
if i do it myself.
I just have to drop off
a gift to my manicurist.
Why don't you
listen to the radio?
Thank you.
Sorry, babe. That took
a little longer than i...
Carlos?
Carlos?
Carlos?!
Carlos!
Oh, there you are.
Thanks, henry.
Where the hell have you been?
I was starving,
So i got that kid to take
me to go get a burger.
I don't believe this. I
was worried sick about you!
I'm sick of waiting here!
You promised me a fun day,
And all i got is a sunburn
on the right side of my face.
I'm sorry. I told you, i
had errands to run first.
What's that smell?
What smell?
It smells like...
Nail polish. Did you
get your nails done?
Is that what
you've been doing?
Excuse me. Miss!
Is that your aston martin
in the handicapped space?
What? Gaby, are you parked
in a handicapped spot?
Move it along, pops. We're
gonna be here a while.
Wait, wait, wait. Did you
get a handicapped tag?
To answer your earlier
question, yes, i got a manicure.
I'm sorry. Are we good?
Oh, my god!
You're exploiting my blindness
So that you can
score better parking?!
That's a really
mean way to put it.
You had me out here,
Sitting like a dog with
the window cracked open.
You used me!
Well, why shouldn't i get something out of this?
You know, the blindness didn't just happen to you.
You can't be serious.
Oh, you bet i am!
Every morning, the
toothpaste has to be
To the left of the
sink, because if it's not,
You can't find it, and
i have to put it there.
And-And sometimes I
don't know-I'm driving,
Or i'm in line at the bank
And i think,"is the
toothpaste there?"
So then i have to
run home and check
Because i don't want
you reaching for the tube
And not being able to find
it. I just didn't think
This was how it was
all gonna tu out, carlos.
I didn't think that every
day for the rest of my life,
A part of me is always gonna
think,"where's the toothpaste?"
Can't you just leave
it in the drawer?
That's not the
point, you blind idiot!
I'm saying
If all i get in exchange
for this crappy situation
Is a nice parking spot
for my $8 manicure,
Then i'm taking it!
Who put pear slices
in the waldorf salad?
Guess that would be me.
Katherine, a waldorf
salad is made with apples.
It's tradition.
Yes, a musty,19th
century tradition
In need of some jazzing up.
Look, i just thought you have
so much on your mind already,
What with the music
and the decorations.
The least i could do was take over the food.
"Take over"?
What in god's name have you
done with my french onion soup?
Oh, it'll be fine.
I told the chef
Nothing is to leave that
kitchen unless i've tasted it.
Katherine
Trust me.
After all,
I've gotten tons of
compliments on the lisianthus.
Here, honey. Let me.
Thanks.
You're welcome.
Just so you know...
I'm sorry for what i'm
putting you through.
If it were anyone but
you, it wouldn't be worth it.
You ready to go to the party?
You tell me.
How do i look?
You look very handsome.
Thank you.
And you look more
beautiful than ever.
How do you know that?
Just a hunch.
Bup, bup, bup! Don't eat that.
We had a
refrigeration problem,
And i don't want
you getting sick.
Oh, dear. Well, i should
throw this dip out.
Thanks. It'll be
about ten minutes
Before i can make
up a new batch.
Do you mind tellinyour boss?
She's not my boss!
Bree! The room
is simply lovely.
You've outdone yourself.
Thank you, mrs. Downing.
Listen, when i present the
founder's award tonight,
I was wondering
Oh, dear. Has no one spoken to you?
About what?
Uh, well...
The committee has decided
that it would be best
If katherine mayfair
present the award this year.
No! That's... that's
my job. I always do it.
Oh, well, you're
already doing so much,
And, well, katherine
was quite insistent.
What's that?
Oh, it's dip. The caterer just said that
I thought we agreed.
Nothing leaves the kitchen
without me tasting it first.
Dig in.
Is everyone having fun?
You and kathere
did an amazing job.
Boy, we didn't think you
guys could work together.
Yeah, we were sure one of you
would end up killing the other.
You really should have
more faith in people.
Excuse me.
Katherine, darling, are
you okay?
Not really.
Oh. I hope there'sothing
wrong with the food.
Is anybody else getting sick?
Oh, no.
No, dear. Just you.
Maybe you should go home.
I can't. I have to present
the founder's award.
Oh, no one would expect you
to do that in your condition.
You know what?
Um, i could do it.
No. I can get it together.
Katherine, no one expects
you to be a martyr.
Why don't you go home?
I can't.
Why not? I'm perfectly
capable of presenting.
I've done it for
the last eight years.
And let's face it.
I mean, no one wants to
accept an award from a woman
Who looks like she should be
in line at the needle exchange.
This is important
to me. I'll be fine.
And now for the presentation
for the founder's award-
Ms. Katherine mayfair.
Thank you, mrs. Downing.
I was honored
When you and the other
members of the committee
Asked me to
present this award.
"I was honored when you..." myeah, myeah, myeah, myeah.
Bree, what's up?
I thought giving out
this award was your thing.
Used to be. Not
anymore. Things change.
This year's founder's award...
Ever since i started working
with that obnoxious backstabber,
She's done nothing but try to
take the spotlight off of me
And put it onto her.
Goes to my dear
friend... bree hodge.
The obnoxious backstabber
just called your name.
Bree has been a pillar
of the fairview community
For many years.
There is no better
friend than bree hodge.
Congratulations.
I know you tried to poison me.
Well, uh,
This has been an
evening full of, um...
Surprises. Uh...
I never would've
imagined that, um,
I would be recognized by
this wonderful organization...
Hi, andrew. Guess what?
Ur mom just won the founder's award.
Lynette, listen to me.
Oh, my god.
You're not gonna believe what's going on down here.
What? What? Is everyone okay?
Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
We're-We're fine.
It's rick's place
Totally went up in flames.
There, uh,there are, like, three
fire trucks here.
Oh, my god! That's
horrible! How did it start?
I They-They
don't know.
Okay,i-I'm gonna-I'll call
you back in about five. Bye.
I want to thank you so much
For presenting me
with this award. I...
I certainly, uh,wasn't
expecting it.
Um, we have a small city
with a great, big heart,
And i am honored
to, uh,accept this award
From my dear friend...
The photographer's asking
If he can get shots
of the two of us.
Wait.
I need to talk to you first.
I misunderstood the
situation, that's all.
Can we just leave it at that?
No, we can't.
And do you know why?
Because i thought
things were going well.
I was having fun with you.
Obviously...
I misunderstood.
So tell me,
Was there a straw that
broke the camel's back?
Or were you planning
on killing me all along?
Here's the thing
You need to understand
about me and my friends.
We each have our niche.
Gabrielle's the glamorous one.
Susan's the adorable
one. Lynette's smart.
Edie's... edie.
And i'm the domestic
one, the organizer-
The one who knows that there are
three tines on a dessert fork.
I'm the one who gets teased
for that. That's who i am.
And that's also who you are.
So?
So...
I don't really know how
to be friends with you.
That's a shame...
Because i understand you better
than all those other women do.
I know how following the rules
And observing
the little graces
Makes you feel like
you're in control.
We've both had days
where it was either
Set a beautiful table
Or curl up in a ball and die.
We're the same, bree.
And if you think that
means we can't be friends,
Then i'm sorry.
But it might also mean
we could be best friends.
Who knew you were
so insightful?
Isn't learning fun?
Terrific, everyone. Thank you.
Pictures.
So... did i lie? Was it cool?
You were right. It really was.
"Thank you, julie."
Oh.
It's good to get out
of my own head, you know?
For months now,i've been
hung up on looking for my dad
And blaming my mom...
And it's gotten me nowhere.
I just wanna start
having fun again.
Thank you, julie.
There you are.
We wanted to get some
pictures with you. Mm.
Orson.
Hi. Um... listen, i
I have a 12:00 curfew,
So if my mom
asks, can you just-
Mike?
No, it's julie.
Oh, you're sleepwalking.
Yeah, i heard about that.
I'm sorry, mike.
Again, not mike.
Why don't i-I get
you back to bed,
And-And
you can-
I'm sorry i ran you over, mike.
Blindness-
It's an affliction
that prevents people
From seeing what is
right in front of them...
Like the wives who
can't detect the jealousy
That consumes
their husbands...
The women unable to see
that a rival might also
Be a friend...
The men who stay oblivious
To the guilt that
lies deep within them.
Yes...
The world is filled with
those who cannot see.
The most dangerous are
the ones who stay blind
To the evil within
their own hearts.
How do we protect
ourselves from these people?
First, we have to open our
own eyes and find them...
Before they find us.
Previously on desperate housewives.
Dylan and katherine raised
their profile
And attracted the attention
of an unwanted admirer.
Mike made
a surprising request...
do you think
you can forgive me?
Which brought orson's guilt
to the surface.
I'm sorry, mike.
Oh, you're sleepwalking.
I'm sorry i ran you over, mike.
Gaby was learning to deal
with carlos being blind...
i'm sorry for what
i'm putting you through.
If it for anyone but you,
it wouldn't be worth it.
And lynette worried...
it's rick's place--
Totally went up in flames.
That jealousy could drive tom
to an act of violence.
The thing you have
to know about lynette scavo
Is that she had always trusted
her husband tom,
Mostly because she could
always tell when he was lying.
Sometimes he would ask her
to repeat the question...
Did i eat... your ice cream?
Is that what you're asking?
Or he would use odd words
he had never used before...
oh, i think it looks...
spiffy.
Or his voice
would get higher...
I guess she's pretty. I mean...
i didn't really notice.
Clearly, tom scavo was
at a distinct disadvantage
When lying to his wife.
And on this particular morning,
That's exactly what lynette...
was unting on.
Whatcha doing?
I am onesing
for a cup of coffee,
But the stupid burner
is acting up again.
Need a little caffeine fix?
Big-Time.
Too much booze last night.
I'm really draggin'.
The open bar is no longer
your friend, huh?
Guess not.
But they were pouring
top-Shelf stuff,
And i couldn't resist.
Is that where you were during
bree's acceptance speech--
Doing free shots at the bar?
No. Uh,
I think that's when i snuck out
to the car to listen to the game.
You go alone?
Well,
I would've invited carlos, except...
obviously, he can't really
sneak around anymore, so...
yeah.
I was thinkin',
If anyone asks
about that fire at rick's,
It'd be good if you had someone
to account for where you were.
Why would it matter?
I didn't start the fire.
Right, right.
It's just...
if anyone thinks you did,
It'd be handy if y could
prove them wrong, wouldn't it?
You think i did it.
No.
One stupid brick,
and now i'm an arsonist?
No, no. Of course not.
It's just,
If the police came here
to ask us about the brick,
They're probably gonna
ask us about the fire,
So you might
wanna be ready.
Listen to me, lynette.
As mad as i have been
at rick,
I had absolutely nothing
to do with this fire.
We're fine.
Okay.
Good.
Uh-Huh.
Lynette scavo had always
trusted her husband.
She had no idea that trust...
was about to go up in flames.

Everyone breaks the rules
now and again,
And when they do,
they always have an excuse...
like the neighbor whose
own trash was already full...
or the blonde who forgot
to eat her breakfast...
or the employee who needed
an advance on his salary...
it's true--
Everyone has a reason
for not following the rules...
even the people who
are meant to enforce them.
Cense and registration,
please.
Well, what did i do?
I wasn't speeding.
There's a construction zone back
there. You failed to slow down.
Are you sure? I didn't
see a sign or anything.
You wanna step out
of the car, please?
You're not gonna give me
a ticket, are you?
My mom will kill me.
Where do you go to school?
Fairview high.
Pretty necklace.
Oh, thanks.
Listen, i'm really sorry
about the construction zone.
I would have slowed down
if i had seen the sign, i swear.
I'll tell you what.
I'll let you go
with a warning.
Just pay more attention
next time, okay?
Thank you. That's very nice
of you. Thank you.
That's everything,
i guess.
Well, if you forgot something,
you can just come back for it,
Or... you could just
not leave.
Oh, that's so sweet, but...
our house
is livable again--
The downstairs anyway--
And we have imposed
long enough.
Besides, mike is
comingome tonight,
And you're gonna need
the house to yourselves.
Well, before you go,
i just want to say that, um...
having you here
these last few weeks--
Susan, i'm just going
across the street.
There's no need to act
like a silent movie heroine.
I know.
I just... i can't stop now.
I broke the seal.
Well, um, as much as i appreciate
This naked display of emotion,
You know how this sort of thing
makes me uncomfortable.
I can't help it.
My hormones
are in overdrive.
Didn't you get that way
when you were pregnant?
No. Never.
Really? Not even when
you heard an acoustic guitar?
No. Never.
Oh, i just can't
control myself like that.
Oh, sure, you can.
Whenever i feel my emotions
getting the best of me,
I simply picture
an empty box,
And i take whatever i'm feeling
and put that in the box,
And then i picture myself
putting the box away
In a big, empty closet
and closing the door.
Then if i have time, i go back
And open the box and
Deal with the emotion...
in private, like a lady.
Thanks.
I'm gonna try that.
So you don't think
i act like a lady?
Prove me wrong, sweetie.
Prove me wrong.
All right.
Come on, girl.
Okay, carlos,
here's the harness.
There you are!
Oh, you must be roxy!
Aren't you the cutest thing! Oh!
Okay, not too close.
It's silk.
Gaby, this is steve. He's the
head trainer at the dog school.
Ah, nice to meet you.
How much he enjoyed
taking classes with roxy.
Well, they make a great team.
Well, i have got a million questions
about this little lifesaver here.
Okay, shoot.
Okay, hypothetical situation--
Carlos and i are
sitting on the couch.
I'm doing my nails.
He's whining for the remote.
How do i get roxy
to fetch it for him?
She's serious.
Oh.
Roxy doesn't do that.
Um, her job is to get carlos
from point "a" to point "b"
As safely as possible.
I get that, but surely
she's trained to do other stuff,
You know, like find his keys
or turn off the radio
Or lick up his spills.
Yeah, and after that, she can go
solve crimes with shaggy and the gang.
Don't ve me i saw a collie on tv
who could push a lawn mower.
Do you have one of those?
Gaby, roxy's fantastic.
Really? Well, for a dog
who's supposed to help us,
She sounds kind of limited.
Sorry, but it's true.
She's not here to help us.
She's here to help me,
Which you would know if you had bothered
to show up to the spouses' orientation.
Well, i'm sorry. I was on my
hands and knees that day,
Scouring the bathroom floor
Because you fused
to pee like a girl.
So...
any other questions?
No, it's crystal clear.
Carlos gets
a new best friend,
And i get to check
the sofa for ticks.
Yay for gaby!
Did i exaggerate?
Actually, you were kin
Oh, it feels good to take
a shower in my own house.
At you doing?
In honor of you coming home, we
are making your favorite meal--
Steak and mashed potatoes.
Oh, that sounds great.
For future reference,
My favorite is
potatoes au gratin. Mmm.
Since when?
Since always.
Since i was 3. Hmm.
You could say "au gratin"
when you were 3?
Oh, it's fine. Susan,
mashed is great, too.
It's not your favorite?
What are you doing?
Excuse me.
I have to put something in a box
and stick it in the closet.
Hormones.
Oh. Got it.
Pretty much anything
sets her off these days.
Uh, which is why
I haven't told her...
told her what?
Something wrong?
Well, when bree and orson
were staying with us,
This weird thing happened.
Oh, yeah. Naked orson?
I heard.
Must have been
quite a show.
No,
this was the next night.
He was sleepwalking, and he said
something kinda strange.
But like i said, he was asleep,
so it's probably nothing.
Julie, what'd he say?
He said...
"i'm sorry i ran over mike."
What?
It's crazy, right?
Why would
he say something like that?
He didn't even know you
when that happened.
Yeah, you're right.
It's crazy.
Yeah, that's what i figured.
Okay, well, i'm gonna go check
on mom and make sure she's okay.
We don't need any more drama
in this house.
Yeah, i agree.
How's the move going?
Need an extra pair of hands?
No, thanks.
We're almost done.
Okay, well,
i won't get in your way then.
Let me just run something
by you.
I got a call today from a couple
Who loved
our work on the founder's ball.
Oh, how sweet.
Yes,
And they want to hire us
to do their anniversary party.
Hire us?
But we're not a business.
We could be.
Think about it.
We do the exact same thing
we did at the ball,
Only this time, we walk away
with a big, fat check.
Katherine, need i remind you we
nearly came to blows over floral choices?
I think it's ourcreative friction
that makes us a great team.
I think it's our creative friction
that nearly caused me to poison you.
All right, look, bree,?
With adam out of the house,
i really need the money.
I sympathize. I do,
but i have a new baby,
And it's really more work than
i care to take on right now.
I understand.
Guess i'll
just do it myself then.
Excuse me?
Now did you take pictures of
those table settings you designed?
I'd love to get copies.
The couple raved about them.
Yeah, sure.
You know, i don't
really think it's fair
That you should profit
from something that i designed.
You're right. It would only be fair
if i asked you to do this with me,
Which i did, and you said no.
So on we go.
I hope you don't mind if i serve
your cinnamon apple crumble.
That is a cherished recipe
from my grandmother.
Well, w it's a cherished recipe
from catering by katherine.
Oh,
i see what's going on here.
This is shameless
emotional blackmail.
And?
And...
it worked beautifully.
I'm in.
No more doggy treats.
She's had enough.
But she's been so good.
Yeah? Well, when she learns
how to make granite sparkle,
She can have more.
I'm giving her a treat.
Carlos, i said no.
Fine. One treat.
That's it.
Those things are expensive,
And until your disability kicks in,
we have to tighten our belts.
So i guess that means you won't
be getting your hair done anymore.
Carlos, remember
what my fingers look like?
Just picture the middle one
all by itself.
Besides, you're the one
who married me for my looks.
Well, i'm blind now,
So as long as you
use deodorant, i'm good.
Do you have any idea how selfish
you sound right now?
Just because you're blind,
the world should suffer?
I'm just saying, you know,
$300 visits to mr. Francois--
Carlos, i'm getting
my hair done! End of discussion!
What are you barking at?
You got your damn treat.
You know, if we really
want to save money,
You could cut down
on those cuban cigars.
Or... here's a thought.
You could get a job.
Why don't you get a job?
Doing what?
Put flags on pencils
and sell them at the airport.
What do i care?
Just get out of my kitchen.
What is this about?
I don't know. I guess she
doesn't like it when you smack me.
Oh, so now i can't hit
my own husband in my own house?
Look, we can cut corners?
But i am not gonna skimp when
it comes to my dog.
Roxy, come.
Hey, neighbor.
Oh, mike. Hey.
Welcome back.
You're looking well.
Yeah, well, you know me.
Indestructible.
Yeah.
What you looking for?
A hammer.
We're putting
some of the pictures back up.
This it?
Thanks, buddy.
You got a minute?
Uh, actually,
uh, bree's waiting--
Waiting for me.
You said something to julie
when you were sleepwalking.
I did?
Yeah, and i need you
to clear it up.
Are you the guy
that ran me over?
Mike...
i'm so sorry.
I'm so...
no way.
That mutt is
not sleeping in our bed!
She's clean. It's okay.
No. No, it's not.
I read the pamphlet steve left.
These dogs are
not allowed on furniture.
I know. I...
i just think it's good for a dog
to sleep with its master.
It helps us bond.
Well, if you ever want
to bond with my boobs again,
You'll get her off!
You're being selfish.
We can
put her at the foot of the bed.
Carlos, no!
She doesn't like it
when you yell at me, remember?
You're right, baby.
I'm sorry.
Let me try it this way.
You listen to me,
you blind son of a bitch.
If you don't get this mangy, 6-Nippled,
cujo wannabe off my satin sheets,
You n't just need a dog
to get around.
You'll need a motorized wheelchair
that you steer with your tongue.
Really?
Carlos, i mean it.
Who's it gonna be--
Me or the dog?
Maternity lingerie--
Yeah, right.
Why don't they just call it
what it really is?
A pup tent to hide
your stretch marks.
Oh, actually, if it's okay,
I'm really not in the mood
right now. I'm sorry.
I understand.
Thanks.
You just don't want to be crushed
under the weight of a repulsive cow.
That is not it.
No, i get it.
Really,
i knew this day was coming.
I just didn't know it would be
a day when i was so horny.
Honey, i still find you
incredibly sexy.
It's me. I. ..
I just got a lot
on my mind right now.
Oh. What's going on?
I found out something
today.
I didn't want to tell you,
but...
well,
you can tell me anything.
That's what we talked about
in all those sessions with the doctor.
You're right.
But if i tell you,
You have to promise to let me
handle this my own way.
Who could that be
at this hour?
Susan.
What on earth?
You are never to come
near my family ever again!
Do you understand?
What are you talking about?
Do you hear me, orson?!
Damn it. Susan, i--
I told you
to let me handle this.
Will someone please tell me?
So you don't know that
your husband tried to kill mike?
What?
Look, i explained this
to mike.
I panicked.
I was trying--
Trying to protect your mother?
I know. Who cares?
You drove the car,
you ran him over,
And you left him for dead!
Susan, let's go.
And the worst part...
all this time,
you pretended to be our friend.
If there was one thing
gabrielle solis would not tolerate,
It was a rival,
Whether she walked
onwo legs...
or four.
So when gabrielle crept
into her bedroom that morning,
She'd made up her mind...
the bitch had to go.
Roxy...
look what i've got.
Come on. Come on.
Yes.
Okay, let's go.
Let's go, roxy.
Let's go, roxy. Let's go.
Let's go in the car.
Hey there, dylan.
Don't you remember me?
I'm the cop who didn't give you
a ticket yesterday.
Um, yeah, i remember.
Would it be okay
if i sat down?
I just want to have
a little chat with you.
Why?
Don't worry.
You're not in trouble.
Actually, i can't stay.
I'm meeting my friend julie
at the mall, so i--
Look, i'm--I'm not trying
to scare you. I just...
i just want to talk.
Talk about what?
How's your mom doing?
You know my mom?
Oh, yeah.
Look,
a couple of days ago,
I saw a picture of you
and kathy in the paper,
And i did a background check,
And i found out that you're living
back at your aunt's place.
When you left yesterday,
i was parked down the street.
You followed me?
So when you pulled me over,
That was--
I lied to you.
You weren't speeding.
I'm sorry.
I just had to meet you.
Who are you?
I'm wayne davis.
I'm your father.
Roxy, this way.
Um, excuse me for a second.
Uh, mrs. Solis,
what are you doing here?
Hi.
Uh, i'm bringing roxy back.
Uh, what?
Shame, isn't it?
I mean, i personally adored
the little angel,
But she and carlos
just did not get along.
Really?
Well, sorry it didn't work out.
I gotta run.
Tell carlos i'll call him
about another dog.
Oh, well, actually,
we found one.
From where? We're the only
guide dog school in the area.
Well, that's it. It's not a dog.
We got him
a seeing... eye... monkey.
He's amazing.
Not only can he call 9-1-1,
he can toast a bagel.
Bye.
Roxy, what the heck happened
back there?
Roxy!
Roxy! Roxy, stop!
Gaby, where were you?
Where's roxy?
Oh, carlos, i'm afraid
i have some bad news.
What? At happened?
Well, you know how you like it
when i read you the box scores?
When i went out
to get the paper--
Ly thinking
of making you happy--
Gaby, where's my dog?
She ran away.
When i opened the door, she saw
a squirrel, and she took off.
She's gone?
Well, you gotta go find her.
Where do you think i've been?
There's no sign of her anywhere.
Yeah, i'm sure you looked
really, really hard.
How dare you. I have looked from
one end of town to the other,
And i'm telling you,
she's nowhere to be found.
But since you love her so much,
i'm gonna keep looking.
Was that roxy?
I'm not sure.
Why don't i go look?
No. Oh, wow.
It's the scavo dog...
way down in their yard.
I guess it's true--
Lose one sense,
all the others get heightened.
Okay, you get that.
I'm gonna go find your dog.
Come on, you stupid mutt.
Gaby, you still here?
Yeah,
still no sign of roxy.
But don't worry.
I'm on the case.
Hey.
That was steve
from the guide dog place.
You want a piece of pie
or somethin'?
Yeah, i'm not ngry either.
I don't know
what to say to you.
You don't have
to say anything.
I'm having
a good time just looking at you.
You have my nose.
Bet you didn't know that,
right?
My mom says we left
because you used to beat her.
Is that true?
Yeah,
i hit her a couple times.
So you admit it?
What, did you think i was gonna lie
and tell you that i was a great husband?
'Cause i wasn't.
But you gotta know, there's
two sides to every story,
And i swear to god, your mom
gave as good as she got.
I mean,
you believe me, right?
I don't know.
You know what?
This was a mistake.
I should go.
Go? We just got here.
Look, i didn't track you down
to cause any problem
I only wanted to make sure that
your mom raised you properly,
And now i see that she did.
I mean, you're...
you're spectacular.
That's what i needed...
to know that you're okay
and...
that a little part of you
looks just like me.
How can you just walk away?
'Cause i'm not the same jerk
i used to be.
Sure, i'd like to have
a relationship with you,
But if your mom is still scared
of me after all these years, uh...
no.
I don't want
to upset her again.
I don't haveo tell her.
What?
She doesn't have to know
that i saw you.
Oh, that's...
i don't know about that.
It's just that i have
so many questions, and...
i don't think
we'd be hurting anybody
If we just sat
and talked for a while.
And we'd keep this
from your mom?
Sure.
Well...
okay.
Darlin', bring me back
that dessert menu.
I wanna have a slice of pie
with my daughter.
Uh, i think we might
be out of candles.
I don't think so.
Check under the bar.
Rick.
How's it goin'?
"How's it goin'"?
It's goin' pretty bad.
I didn't mean to. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry- Sorry for your troubles.
Oh, that's touching, man.
Thanks.
So did you just come here
to bust my hump,
Or is there something
i can help you with?
Actually, you can help me.
You can help me figure out
what the hell these were doing
By the back door
of my torched restaurant.
How should i know?
So that's how
you're gonna play this?
No candles here. I'm--
I'm gonna go check in the back.
Great.
Look, i can see you're upset,
pal,
But i'm not the guy
you're looking for.
You know i respect you...
hey, andrew.
What do you need?
Uh, i'm looking for candles,
And--And that guy rick's
here.
Oh, my god!
Stop it!
What are you doing?
Stop. Hey, easy. Easy.
Just stop it!
Are you okay?
Yeah.
Andrew, do something!
Do something!
Stop it! Stop!
Oh, for god sakes,
what is the matter with you?
What are you, 12 years old?
Stop it.
Jeez.
So when are you guys gonna
finish grilling my husband?
It won't be much longer, ma'am.
You know, in spite of
everything that's happened,
It's really good
to see you again.
It makes me realize
how much i miss you.
If you insist on questioning my husband
about a crime he didn't commit,
You should at least
have all the facts.
Okay. You've got my attention.
Well, for starters,
Mr. Coletti
opened his restaurant
To get back at me because i
wouldn't have an affair with him.
 Honey.
Oh,
So you're saying your husband had
two motives for setting the fire?
No. I am saying that if anyone
had an ax to grind, it's rk.
Maybe he set the fire himself
soe could blame my husband.
I was at the gym.
You can call my trainer.
And tom was at
the founder's ball with me.
We have witnesses that say
he disappeared for a while.
I told you, i was in the car
listening to the basketball game.
That's true. I saw him.
I was mad that he ditched me,
So i went to drag his
ass back inside.
But when i saw him
shoutingt the radio,
I decided i'll just wait
And make his life miserable
when we get home.
So unless there's a law
Again schoosing lebron james
over your wife,
I think we're done here.
All right.
So that's it? Y-You're
just gonna let him go?
Look, we don't have enough
evidence to hold him, sir.
Because his wife
provided him an alibi?
Come on, man.
Rick, look.
You know me.
If tom had done
something like this,
Do you really think
i would protect him?
Fine.
You know, you didn't have
to make up that story for me.
Didn't i?
'Cause it kinda seemed
Like they had you
against the ropes in there.
Well, that would only be
a problem if i were guilty,
And clearly, i'm not, right?
God, you don't
believe me, do you?
Sure, i do. It must've been
some other random maniac
With a grudge against rick
who burned down his restaurant.
So you're calling me a liar?
That's what you're doing.
You're saying i lied.
Well, it wouldn't be you
lied about the brick,
And you were pretty smooth,
too. Hell, i bought it.
Yeah, just like i bought your story
about never sleeping with rick.
Excuse me?
"Oh, look at me, rick.
You know me, rick."
Okay.
God, i felt like telling
you guys to get a room.
Okay, you are angry,
so i'm gonna let that one pass,
And i'm gonna say this
for e very last time.
Nothing happened
between me and rick.
Okay.
I didn't set that fire.
You see? I can talk slow, too.
Carlos asked me to pick up
some doggy treats for roxy.
He called you?
Why didn't he ask me?
Oh, i think you were busy
at the time...
kidnapping his guide dog.
Classy, by the way.
Don't judge me.
You don't know
this hound from hell.
I raise my voice a teensy bit,
and she barks,
Or i give carlos a little smack,
and she growls.
Well, i have an idea.
Why don't you not
do those things?
Thanks for the biscuits, edie.
No, i'm serious.
There was always
a certain... sick charm
To the way you used
to abuse carlos.
But now that he's blind,
it's just sick.
We're fine. This is who we are.
This is our relationship.
Well, ur relationship
has to change, gaby,
Because he's changed.
Not that much.
Just his eyes.
Mm, no. I know carlos. He's proud.
He's gonna pretend that he can
still go toe-To-Toe with you
As if he was the same man
that he always was.
But he's not, and he
will never admit that.
Are you done with your armchair
analysis, 3-Divorce annie?
Sure. But if you're not
gonna treat carlos right,
There are plenty of
other womenout t?
I think i proved that.
Why don't
you come inside?
I can't come out my front door
every day and see that man.
We have to move.
Oh.
Susan...
i know this is difficult,
But before you start
putting up "for sale" signs,
Let's just take a step back.
Take a step back from what?
He tried to murder you.
I know what orson did
was horrible, but...
i've decided
to forgive him.
How can you do that?
He put you in a coma.
I sat there day after day,
wondering if you were gonna live.
As far as i'm concerned,
orson can go to hell.
Well, i've talked to him. Trust me,
He's already been there.
Well, that's not enough.
He should pay for what he did.
He should go to prison.
And what, leave bree
without a husband
And benjamin without a dad?
You don't want tha
Look...
i've done some pretty horrible
things in my life,
But you forgave me
Because you knew how
much i regretted 'em.
I really believe
he's sorry for what he did.
So now i have
to forgive him
I've just got to.
But...
i also understand
if you can't.
Hey, you guys know you're not
supposed to be out of bed.
How come daddy's sleeping
on the couch again?
Come here.
Come on.
Okay.
Mommy and daddy
are sort of... fighting,
But we're working through it.
What are you fighting about?
Oh, something he did
that made mommy really mad.
Can we talk to you
about something?
Yes, of course.
The other day
at the pizza place...
mm-Hmm?
We heard daddy say that man
wanted to take you away from us.
Oh, sweetie, i am so sorry.
I bet that really
scared you, didn't it?
Yeah.
So when you went
to that party,
We got on our bikes
and de down to his restaurant.
You did what?
We just wanted him
to go away.
That's why we set the fire.
So please don't be mad at daddy.
Oh, my god.
Mike says i need
to forgive orson...
susan--
And he's right.
I have to find a way
to make peace with all of this.
But you need to understand,
It's gonna be one of the
hardest things i've ever done.
And like most things
in my life,
I probably won't do it
with much elegance or grace.
So if i don't come over
to your house for coffee...
if i don't smile
when the two of you walk by,
Just please know
that i still love you.
And for forgiving orson...
just be patient.
I'll get there.
I think it's admirable that
you wanna forgive orson...
because i can't.
Whatcha doin'?
Working on the menu for the event
that bree and i are catering.
I have to stop now to...
pick up the invitations at
the printer's beforehey close.
I can do that for you.
It's okay, sweetie.
No, i want to.
Maybe i could pick up some
dinner for us on the way back.
You know, mrs. Hoskins' daughter
became nice like this once...
right before she brought
home a boy named slash.
I'm being nice because i've
been a pain lately, and...
with adam gone,
we need to be a team.
It's just us now.
What?
It's just...
it's like you turned
into this lovely young woman
When i wasn't looking.
Hey.
We have to stop at the printer
on the way to dinner.
Whatever you say,
sweetheart.
The truth is,
Everyone breaks the rules
now and then...
well, what you've you
been doing?
Never thinking for one second
they might get caught.
...some things disappear.
Like, that happened
to me like...
but if they do,
They simply ask
for forgiveness.
And most of the time,
they receive it.
But some acts are so wicked,
They demand only
our condemnation.
How do people avoid
such a fate?
Well... the trick is
Knowing which rules
are made to be broken...
and which rules...
are not.
Previously on Desperate Housewives
Orson's secret came out
So you don't know that your
husband tried to kill mike
And Bree couldn't forgive him
Lynette's stepdaughter Keila never
adjusted in being part of the family
Im never gonna love her
And you can't make me
And Dylan reconnected
with her real father
I like that relationship with you
But you mum is still scaring me.
I don't wanna upset her
I don't have to tell her
It happens in every marriage.
Couples accumulate
lovely things-
Things that make a house
a home.
But when the home is broken,
these things must be divided.
The most dignified way
to do this
Is for each spouse
To keep what is
most important to them.
And Bree and Orson hodge
were nothing...
If not dignified
I assume you'll want
the pewter cat.
That was my gift to you.
You adored it, as I recall.
That's why Im giving you
the choice.
And what about that hummel
from your aunt?
It's ugly as sin,
But she insists
that it's valuable.
You keep it.
Keep everything.
There's only one thing
in this house that I want.
I know, but Im the one thing
you can't have.
Please,
you have to forgive me.
Orson,
every wife understands
That her husband
will make a few mistakes-
A forgotten anniversary,
the occasional harsh word,
But we all have to
draw the line somewhere,
And Im drawing mine
at the attempted murder
Of my best friend's husband.
Bree, if I could open up
my heart
And show you how sorry I am,
I would, but I can't.
There must be something else
I could do.
There is one thing.
Name it.
Turn yourself in
to the police.
But the statute of limitations
hasn't run out.
They would arrest me.
And you'd probably go to prison.
Yes, I could go away for years.
Exactly, and if you could muster
that kind of moral courage,
I think
I could forgive you.
Oh, come on.
I promise
I'll wait for you.
Bree...
I can't go to prison.
Very well.
So do you want the cat
or not?
In any separation,
it's only fair
That each spouse get to keep
what is most important to them.
That's how Bree hodge
got to keep her pewter cat...
And Orson hodge got
to hold on to...
His freedom.
The suburbs are flush
with a certain kind of fool.
You know the type-
The man who opens his door
to total strangers...
The woman who never
uses her latch.
It never occurs to them
That letting someone
into their home...
Means letting them
into their lives.
Hi. Im Ellie. I understand
you got a room to rent.
Yeah, come on in.
So because of
my husband's disability,
Our financial situation
has changed,
And we have this big house.
Well, it's an amazing place,
and I love the room.
I can't believe
it's still available.
Well, you know... Anyhow, uh,
you have a great credit score.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
what was that?
What was what?
Ellie, did she just give me
a dirty look?
Uh...
Yeah, I thought so.
Im sorry, Ellie.
There's been some tension
between my husband and me.
See, the truth is, we could've
had the room rented by now
If my husband
wasn't so paranoid.
Why, because I wouldn't let the
swedish bodybuilder move in?
You're as blind as a fruit bat.
How would you know
if he's a bodybuilder?
I brushed up against him.
I felt his bicep. It was huge.
That wasn't his bicep.
Why do you think
he rushed out of here?
Okay, I normally dig this sort
of interpersonal stuff,
But I have a class in 20,
so back to me?
You're right, Ellie.
My husband was
totally inappropriate.
So a class? Are you a teacher?
Actually, Im an art student.
My life was working pretty well,
and so I decided to junk it
And learn how to paint fruit.
It's, uh, stupid, right?
No, it's gutsy.
Well, we like you,
Ellie,
And if you have
first and last months' rent,
We'd like you even more.
Fantastic.
I just hit the bank,
so do you mind cash?
Oh, no, I love cash.
Cash and I go way back.
So are you okay with this,
Or do you need
to grope her, too?
So that really wasn't
the guy's arm?
It had an elbow.
Is this the clean pile?
'Cause Im not seeing it!
You know what?
Do 'em all again.
This time,
use a little elbow grease.
How are they doing?
They are not suffering
enough for my taste.
Are you sure that washing
dishes is the right punishment?
Well, gee, Im kind of
at a loss here, tom.
Dr. Spock didn't have a chapter
on how to punish your kids
For burning down a building. I just
don't feel like we're handling this right.
Maybe we should take 'em
to therapy.
Tom, they're not
serial killers.
They're two little boys
Who were afraid their parents
were breaking up.
But still-
No. We can handle this
in-house.
We can make sure they never
do anything like this again.
Fine.
We'll try it your way.
But this next month
Is gonna be like boot camp
for these guys.
They are going to
be cleaning out the gutters,
Taking out the trash,
mowing the lawns.
Wait a second.
Th ose are your chores.
No time to talk.
Dinner shift's starting.
Okay, this is the place.
Oh, here, let me throw that
away for you.
No, Im not finished
with it.
It's a lamaze class.
I guarantee you I will not
be the only woman in there
Holding a chimichanga.
Wow. It's all couples.
I wish mike didn't have
that rehab thing tonight.
Do you want me to stay?
I can skip the movie.
Oh, no,
that's okay. I'll be fine.
Okay. Have fun.
Quit eyeing it.
I ain't sharing.
Okay, don't talk.
Just listen.
Remember last year
when I brought up
Dad's new girlfriend,
and you said you never wanted
To hear another word about
one of his skanks again? Yeah.
Okay, well, I just spotted them
in the hallway,
And there's something
you should know.
Oh... My god.
Okay, you're all caught up. He got his
skank pregnant, and you didn't tell me?
I tried, remember? I said,
"dad and marisa are about to-"
And then you stopped me,
and then you said,
"talk to the hand, " and I said, "no one says that anymore"
okay, I get it.
One more thing.
They're married. See ya.
Susie q! What a small world!
Look how fat you are.
Hello, Karl.
Marisa, this is Susan,
my ex-wife.
Hello. It's so nice
to finally meet... You.
Honey, I-Im gonna go sign us
in and get us a couple mats.
Okay.
Can you believe this?
What are the chances we'd
end up having more kids, huh?
Especially you.
What does that mean?
Im just saying,
most eggs your age don't take.
Power to you.
Okay, clearly,
this is not going to work.
So why don't you
take your child bride
And find another class?
I know. She's young. Makes you
wanna have work done, huh?
Or should I say, more work
Done? The only work I've had done
Was getting 185 pounds of ugly
fat sucked out of my house.
You're jealous. I get it.
She's gorgeous, funny,
a law professor.
Oh, no, no, no, th-those are not
the legs of a law professor.
Not that she needs to work.
I just made partner
at my firm. Thanks.
I keep telling her,
"slow down.
"If you need something to do,
Why not oversee the remodel
of our new ski chalet?"
Well, I better get back
to marisa.
And by the way,
you're dripping.
Bye, mom. Im leaving.
Be home by 10:00.
10:00?
But it's almost 8:00 now.
Yes, and it's also
a school night.
Fine.
Introduce me to this boy,
And we'll talk about
making your curfew later.
Yeah,
maybe some other night.
Sweetie, Im gonna have to
meet him eventually.
It's just... I don't even know
if I like him yet.
When I do, you can meet him.
I'll be home by 10:00.
Hey, dad.
Hey, princess.
Let's go. Im starving.
Honey, I can't find
my nail file. Have you seen it?
Is that some kind
of joke?
Oh, right. I keep forgetting
you're useless.
Im gonna see
if Ellie has one.
Hey, Ellie,
you got a sec?
Be right there.
Hey, what's up?
Hey, um...
oh, Im sorry.
I didn't know
you were... Entertaining.
Hi. Im gaby solis.
Hey.
Um, so what do you need?
Oh, you know what?
It can wait.
I'll see you
in the morning.
Okay, that was weird.
What?
Earlier tonight, I saw a guy
coming out of Ellie's room,
So I assumed
it was her boyfriend,
But just now I caught her
in there with another guy.
Okay. So we have two tramps
living in our house.
That was for the "useless"
comment, wasn't it?
Mm-hmm.
And it felt good.
Oh, it sounds like
he's leaving.
I hope
it's not 'cause of me.
Mm.
Maybe I should go
apologize.
Okay, there may be
two tramps in this house,
But only one of 'em
is getting paid.
Hey, lynette.
Ida's cat got out again.
You haven't seen him, have ya?
No, sorry.
I hope you find him.
Well, if he's anything like ida,
he'll wander into my house drunk
The next time
"guiding light" is on.
Wait. Hold on.
I have to fix this.
This is so unfair.
Yeah, I know. I hate her.
How come she's not
in trouble?
Because we started the fire,
you idiot,
So now we have
to be punished.
I know,
but it was her idea! Boys?
Who are you talking about?
Kayla?
Can I speak to you
for a second?
I guess.
I need to ask you something,
And I want you
to tell me the truth, okay?
Did you have anything to do
With the fire
at rick's restaurant?
Did someone say I did?
Im looking for
a "yes" or "no" answer here.
I didn't start the fire.
No, the twins did,
but they say it was your idea.
It was a joke.
I didn't think
they'd actually do it.
Kayla...
Why would you even joke
about something like that?
We heard
you and daddy talking
About how rick wanted
to take you away.
Porter was so mad.
He wanted to blow rick up.
Preston told him
he could use dynamite.
I told them
that was stupid.
No one has dynamite
in their house.
But everyone has matches.
Do you have any idea
what you've done?
Someone
could have been killed.
But they weren't.
But it doesn'tmatter!
Intentionally setting a fire
is a very serious crime.
Don't you get that?
I do.
That's why I think it's good
you're punishing the twins.
They're really bad kids,
And they need to learn.
I told you
we'd be overdressed.
There's nothing wrong
with that.
It shows our respect
for lamaze,
And, you know,
the whole birthing process.
Or it's that
your ex-husband's here.
Karl? Is he here?
Oh, what a freakish-
Don't even bother.
Why didn't you just tell me?
'Cause I knew you'd make us
switch to another class.
Last time I was here,
Karl kept throwing
his perfect life in my face,
And I just wanted
to come back here
And show him that we were doing
well, too. Hence the sport coat.
"Hence." That's classy.
Say a lot of "hence"
when we see him.
Susan, Im not gonna lie
about who I am.
Im not asking you to lie.
Im just saying spin.
Why won't you spin?
I don't know.
Hey, plumber!
Somebody clog a toilet?
Im in.
Hey, guys.
Mike, you remember Karl?
And this is Karl's wife marisa.
Hello.
So how's things going?
You still spending
most of your time
With your head
under a sink?
Actually, I hired
a couple of guys,
And they do all the work.
I just sit back
and cash the checks,
Hence the sport coat.
Yeah, you guys look fantastic.
I feel like such a slob.
Kind of overdressed,
aren't you?
Well, after this,
we have a big party to go to.
Yeah, our social life
is just crazy these days.
Seems like every night we have
some fancy party. Just bananas.
Why don't you ever
take me out?
Hey, at least
I didn't ditch you
On the first day
of lamaze class.
I didn't ditch Susan.
I was getting my 30-day chip.
What, you're like an alkie?
Drugs, actually.
Prescription drugs.
But I went through rehab,
And Im clean now.
Wow. Congratulations.
Okay, people, time to
get started. Take your seats.
So your hubby's been in rehab?
That's just bananas.
Wow.
I know.
Turns out the whole thing
was kayla's idea.
Well, I guess
porter and preston have
A new dishwashing buddy,
huh?
Mm, no.
I think it goes
a little further than that.
I think we have
A seriously troubled
young girl.
She needs...
professional help.
Like therapy?
You brought it up before,
and in this case,
I really don't think
we have a choice.
Interesting.
So the boys, who actually
Physically set the fire-
they don't need therapy,
But kayla, who only
talked about it-she does?
You didn't see her.
She just sat there,
Playing with her doll
with this kind of eerie calm.
Oh, she was calm. Yeah,
better nip that in the bud.
No, you're missing my point.
No, I get your point.
There are different rules
for my kid
Than there are for yours.
Well... Yeah.
Think of what that poor girl
has been through.
And on top of that...
Her mom
was kind of a psycho.
Okay, you are saying
that kayla is a psycho now.
I am just saying,
apple... Tree.
Maybe not so far.
And Im just saying,
my daughter is fine.
No therapy.
Orson, what are
you doing here?
Bree, it's so good to see you.
I have been doing some thinking.
Yes, I can smell the
thinking on your breath.
Are you insane, driving
in this condition?
No, I didn't. I arrived sober,
and I drank while I waited.
I am a law-abiding man.
Except for the
occasional hit-and-run.
Ah, the incident. That's
what Im here to talk about.
I am prepared to
meet your condition
And go to the police.
You are?
Yes, I have it
all figured out.
The key is the
sleepwalking. Susan saw it.
We'll find a
psychiatrist to testify
That I was sleepwalking
when I drove the car.
It's brilliant! No, it's
a pathetic fantasy
Fueled by cowardice
and amaretto sours.
You committed a
crime, Orson. Face it.
Bree, I just want to
come home. Please!
Hey! Im glad you two
are patching things up,
But take the
makeup sex inside.
Edie, would you do me a favor
And take Orson back
to his apartment?
I have to let my sitter go
home. Uh, all right. Hop in.
Oh, no, please. Don't
make me go back there.
The other divorced men are
trying to start a book club.
Oh, for god sakes.
You can sleep it off
on my couch tonight.
Now hitch up your
skirt and get in.
Yeah. Yeah.
There have been men
coming out of her room
At all hours of the night,
And I saw her
counting a wad of cash.
So long story short,
I need your help to get
that hooker out of my house.
What do you want us to do?
Well, I've got
no solid evidence,
And she's got a lease.
So, bob, I was hoping you
could "solicit" her services.
That way I'll have proof.
You do know Im gay, right?
Exactly. You people are
theatrical, and I need
Someone I can count on to
give a decent performance.
I don't know. I'll do it.
What?
Well, no offense.
I just think bob has a
better shot at pulling it off.
He's a little more...
Butch. I know.
You hear that, honey?
Please, the only way you'd be
convincing as a straight guy
Is if you died and came
back as a straight guy.
Im sorry. Who went to their
senior prom with a girl?
Yeah, suzy sellers, gay maker.
If you're looking for
butch, you should know
That I played tony
in "west side story"
To rave reviews.
He also made out
with officer krupke
During intermission.
Well, I really don't
care who does it.
Just get it done.
And... Don't wear that.
Ugh. Never watch
a c-section film
If you had a
calzone for lunch.
Everything okay?
Did you have to tell
Karl about rehab?
You said I didn't have to lie.
Yeah, but that doesn't mean
You have to go blurting all
our deepest, darkest secrets.
It's not dark. It's
part of who I am.
Plus one of the first things
they teach you in the program is
It's not healthy to keep
secrets. Hence, the honesty.
Oh, enough with the "hence."
Im just saying that
some things are private,
And I think that
you can be honest
Without being inappropriate.
When I said it, his
wife congratulated me.
Did you notice that?
And Karl made his
happy monkey face.
Did you notice that?
You know what, Susan?
This reminds me of the
battle I have to fight
Every day for the
rest of my life.
That's what's important to me.
I don't give a rat's ass
what your ex-husband thinks.
This isn't dr. Kagen's office.
Well, actually, this is a
different kind of doctor.
You know, the kind
you can talk to?
You brought me to a shrink?
Well, I thought you might like
To have a safe place where
you could share your feelings.
You know?
With your mom's death
and moving in with us,
You've been through a lot.
That was a long
time ago. Im fine.
Well, good,
But sometimes when you
go through hard things,
It changes the way you think.
Maybe we have trouble
telling the difference
Between what's right
and what's wrong.
I don't have any
trouble with that.
Actually, you do.
That's why you're here.
So let's just wait and
talk to the doctor, okay?
You know what, lynette? Hmm?
Maybe I should
talk to the doctor
About right and wrong.
Good.
Then maybe I should
talk to the police.
What? No. Sweetie, we
don't need to do that.
Really? 'Cause what the
twins did is a crime.
I mean, like you said,
someone could've been killed.
So if we don't go to the
police, wouldn't that be wrong?
You don't understand.
No, I do.
If I have to talk to the shrink,
I have to talk to the cops.
Hi. You must be kayla.
Im all ready for you.
Actually, I think we're okay.
We... Resolved our problems
Just sitting in
your waiting room.
Boy, you're good.
Ahem. 'Kay. So we're gonna go.
Target in place. We're a go.
He's coming out.
What is he wearing?
He looks like the
lost member of wham!
He thinks the outfit
makes him look straight.
Just be thankful I got the
toothpick out of his mouth.
Must he put his hand
on his hip like that?
Butch up, for god sakes!
What?! What do you think I am?
Uh-oh.
What?! Ohh!
Oh, crap! Abort! Abort!
Im sorry. Im sorry. You are a
pig, and Im gonna kick your ass.
Ohh!
Ellie, what are you doing?
Your creepy neighbor
he came over here
And offered me money to
sleep with him. Gaby, tell her.
Tell me what?
Uh, he did the
same thing to me.
Perv! Ohh!
Hey, that's enough.
Gaby, tell her, or I will.
What's going on?
Here's the thing.
I thought you were a hooker.
So I had lee proposition you so
I could catch you in the act.
But guess what? You
passed the test. Yay!
Everybody inside
for margaritas.
Ellie, wait. I made a mistake.
Can we please talk about this?
Dude, you just told your
neighbors that Im a whore.
Look at it from
my point of view.
You're an attractive woman.
Guys are coming and going.
I saw you take money
from one of 'em.
What am I supposed to think?
All right. You
might as well know.
I do tattoos.
You do what?
See, I've been
working downtown,
And I have this jerk of a boss
who takes 70% of my money.
So Im trying to
earn enough cash
To finally open my own shop.
You've been running a tattoo
parlor out of my house?
I know. Im sorry I lied.
I'll be gone in the morning.
Okay, Ellie, wait.
You don't have to
go. Are you sure?
Because I have to keep doing
my work to pay for school.
Well, I suppose I could look
the other way for a few months.
It's the least I could do
for thinking you're a whore.
Forgive me?
Of course.
Oh, hi.
Hi, edie. Thanks again for
helping me out last night.
Oh, no problem.
Orson's car is still
parked at my house.
Um, did he mention when he'd
be coming back to pick it up?
Well, why don't you ask him
yourself? He's in the shower.
He spent the night here?
Apparently, he's not a big
fan of fairview towers,
And he was so drunk and whiny,
I just let him ride my couch.
Well, um, just so you
know, in the future,
Im not comfortable with
that. This can't happen again.
Bree...
What are you getting at?
Oh, i-i-i
think you know.
Tell me anyway,
Just in case you're not
saying Im a big slut.
Oh, come on, edie.
You know, carlos, mike, Karl-
You do have a way at picking
at other women's leftovers.
First of all, I am
not attracted to Orson.
I mean, that would be
like having sex with pbs.
And second, just because I
don't like your attitude,
Im gonna let him stay
as long as he wants. Edie!
Days, weeks-might even let
him hang my christmas lights.
Come on, edie. Think
of our friendship.
How'd you expect me
to react, lynette?
You took her to
therapy behind my back.
And I wouldn't have done
that unless I thought
We had a serious problem, which we
do. Why, because she threatened you?
Of course she did. You ambushed
her. Tom, it is one thing
Not to want to admit
something's wrong with your kid.
It's another to just bury
your head in the sand.
Who's burying their head in the sand? You are.
there are opportunities that you can see that-
No, no, no, no, you're distorting reality.
Im not! What would be my agenda?
You can't pull
the crap like this.
Whoa!
What are you doing?
I jumped off the
roof. It was awesome.
No way.
Yeah. It was just like a
parachute. You wanna try it?
But maybe it won't work.
It will. I just did it.
If you want, I can show you.
Oh, wait. You're in trouble.
You can't.
Never mind.
...your head in the sand. No.
You're burying your head in the sand.
It is different. No, because you're distorting reality.
there are so many opportunities that you could look and see
What's going on. I am not! But you
can't pull crap like this, lynette.
Either you treat kayla like she's
your own kid  come on. I do.
Aah!
Mom!
Ow! Ow, ow, ow, ow!
Oh, my god! Oh, my
god! What happened?
Is he okay?
Porter, get down off
that roof! Get up. Up.
Ow! It hurts. Oh, we gotta
take him to the hospital.
Okay, you stay here. You
take care of the kids. Okay.
I will take him to the
hospital. All right.
No, you-you both go.
I got the kids. Go, go, go, go.
Thanks, karen. Come here, buddy.
There. It's okay, sweetie.
You're gonna be just fine.
There.
Hey, susie.
Where's the plumber?
Fishing a wedding ring out of
some housewife's grease trap?
He's not feeling well.
I see marisa
isn't here either.
Yeah, she got stuck
at her book signing.
She writes books, like you,
Only hers are for
grown-ups and they sell.
Okay, Karl,
you win. You happy?
Whoa. What's this about?
Just drop the act.
You are so loving this.
You ended up
With the miss america
with a law degree,
And I ended up with
the pillhead plumber.
Bravo.
Oh! Damn it! Why
won't this unroll?
You know, marisa's
not perfect.
We have our problems
like anyone else.
Oh, really?
You guys live
one day at a time?
Is your first thought
when she's late
That maybe she's out using
again or maybe she's dead?
It just seems like everything
is so fragile right now,
Which is not the
way you want it to be
When you're about
to have a baby.
Ugh.
So you're worried you
might be having a kid
With an unreliable guy.
I get it. You did
that once before.
Uh, yeah. That
guy was the worst.
Wasn't i, though?
I cheated, drank too much.
I made that play
for your cousin.
Oh, right, you didn't
know about that.
That never happened.
Anyway, I lied about
every bit of it.
At least mike's
trying to be honest.
I know.
I just wish I could
fast-forward through my life
And see that
everything ends up okay.
Hey, don't tell
the plumber this,
But, uh... He's a good guy.
I think he's gonna
be there for you
In a way that I never was.
Thank you.
Which cousin?
Oh, look, a model
of the uterus.
He's a big, gray cat, so if you
could just keep an eye out?
Of course. Actually,
karen, when Im done here,
I could go try to find toby for you.
Thanks, Bree. I appreciate that.
Oh, if you do find him,
don't look him in the eye.
It angries him up.
That's very nice
of you to help her,
And it'll take your mind off
of everything with Orson, too.
I hope so. Truth
is, I miss him.
And I'll probably let
him come home eventually.
I just need to
know he understands
The gravity of what he did.
Well, I don't know what
he did, but be careful.
Some men say they're
going to change,
And they can't.
Oh, hello, Dylan.
You look lovely.
She has a date with a
boy I haven't met yet.
It's just a movie.
It's no big deal.
Be that as it
may, it's the, what,
Third time you've gone out?
I don't even know his name.
Mom, I told you. Im not
ready for you to meet him.
When I am, you'll know. Good
night, mrs. Hodge. Good night.
Okay, back to business.
How do you feel about
parker house rolls?
I mean, personally, I
think they're played out.
Actually, Bree, can we pick
this up again tomorrow?
Well, of course. Is
everything all right?
Oh, yes. I just need to
go spy on my daughter.
Ah, the key is to keep one car
Between yours and hers
at all times. Have fun.
Oh, we should probably
get the check.
I have to be back by 10:00.
We still have time for coffee?
I don't wanna push it. Mom
was all over me tonight.
Im sorry about that.
Whatever. It's fine.
No. It's not. I can see how
hard this whole thing is on you.
It makes me wish
we could just...
Tell her the truth.
I don't know.
Well...
It's your choice. And
you're probably right.
We got a good thing going
here. I don't wanna ruin it.
But I'll tell you something.
If it was only up to me...
I'd come clean.
You would?
Absolutely.
That way I could tell
your mom how sorry I am.
I
I wouldn't expect her to forgive me,
But I could hope
She could at least...
See I've changed.
But whatever you
wanna do is okay by me.
Okay, thank you.
Well, I've got a room at
a hotel in mt. Pleasant.
I guess I'll get going.
Oh, it's late. Why
not just go tomorrow?
Well, I feel
like Im imposing.
You are.
But you make a decent martini,
So what the hell.
So...
You like the
hodge formula, huh?
You see, the secret-
I don't hear shaking.
By the way, did you see Bree
when you were coming home?
Oh.
No, I didn't.
I keep thinking
she's gonna call me.
Look, you don't have to talk
about it if you don't want to,
But... What the heck happened
Over at ken and
barbie's dream house?
I made a mistake, and
Bree won't forgive me.
You see, that's the problem
with the Brees of this world.
They're too damn perfect.
I mean, they don't understand
That people like you and me
well, that we screw up.
Yeah, well, this was
no ordinary mistake.
This was-this was
something terrible.
Was it something gay?
What?
Of course it
wasn't. Keep talking.
Trust me.
Bree will never forgive me.
You know what?
Maybe she shouldn't.
Maybe Im not worthy
of forgiveness.
Well...
Are you sorry
for what you did?
Yes. More than
anyone will ever know.
Well, then you're worthy.
Thank you, edie.
Mm. Don't start.
Im drunk. Im gonna
start crying, too.
Come on.
You're a good
person, edie britt.
Well, you're not
so bad yourself.
Mm, I don't
I don't think we should...
You're right.
Bad idea.
I blame the hodge formula.
Yes.
You're probably tired.
Let me get your
room ready for you.
Mom?
Can I talk to you?
Of course.
I guess I just have to say it.
I've been lying to you.
There is no boy.
And?
And...
Well, I've been meeting
someone. That part is true.
But it's dad.
I've been meeting dad.
Really?
So... You're not upset?
You made it very clear that
you wanted to meet your father,
So I knew this day was coming,
And I prepared myself.
Well, can I go get him, then?
Come in! She says it's okay.
Hey, kathy.
Been a long time.
Dylan, why don't you
go up to your room
So we can catch up?
It's all right, really.
Go ahead, honey.
You did a great job with her.
She's, uh, she's
a wonderful girl.
You look fantastic.
Haven't aged a day.
Look, Im here for Dylan, okay?
Im sure that's
what you told her,
And Im sure she
believed it...
Because she doesn't know you.
But I do.
No, you don't, kathy,
not anymore.
It's been a long time
12 years.
I know exactly
how long it's been.
Okay. Good,
Because, um... I've changed.
Im a different man now.
Well, you have to admit
that that's possible, right?
You've changed, huh?
Well, maybe you have.
I have. Like to know how?
Sure... If you wanna tell me.
Im not scared of you anymore.
Good.
You don't have to be.
Im not the same woman
you knocked around,
The woman you punched...
Choked...
The one whose blood you
licked off your knuckles.
She's gone.
So you'll just have to
prove you're a man...
Some other way.
You trying to
make me mad, kathy?
I didn't know I still could.
Can i?
This is a lot to deal
with after so long, I guess.
I shouldn't have sprung
it on you all at once.
Tell Dylan I'll
call her tomorrow.
And you're as beautiful
as you ever were, kath.
Good night.
The word "welcome"
always carries with it
A certain amount of risk.
After all,
To let someone into your home
is to let them into your life.
And we never know what
sorts of horrible secrets
They carry with them.
We can't foresee
the painful effect
They might have
on our loved ones.
We don't anticipate the
gossip that could result
From their presence.
Yes...
We must be very careful
With those we invite
into our lives...
Because some...
Will refuse to leave.
Previously on...
Gaby's new tenant...
I understand you got a room to rent.
We like you.
If you have first and last months' rent,
we'd like you even more.
Came with a dangerous secret.
I'm your father. Wayne's return
meant trouble for Katherine.
She doesn't know you,
but I do.
Did you have anything to do with
the fire at rick's restaurant?
Lynette tried to warn tom about kayla...
i think we have a seriously
troubled young girl.
And in his time of weakness,
Orson chose the wrong
shoulder to cry on.
I don't... think...
you're right.
The incident as it
would come to be known-
happened late on a tuesday afternoon.
Witnesses included an old woman...
a blind man...
and a young boy.
The old woman, whose hearing
was not what it used to be,
saw Bree hodge emerge from her house
in a way that told her
she was upset about something.
The blind man,
whose hearing had become more acute,
heard Edie say... oh, hey, Bree.
What's up?
...in a way that suggested
Edie wasn't expecting any trouble.
The young boy,
who was not yet 11,
heard Bree hodge say...
i saw you kissing my husband.
But he couldn't understand
why someone would be angry about kisses,
which he thought grown-ups liked.
As the old woman pretended
to clip hedges she'd already clipped,
she saw the body language
of her neighbors change.
As the blind man listened in,
he heard Bree say...
what were you thinking, Edie?
We're supposed to be friends.
We are friends.
I am not interested in Orson.
The young boy then heard Edie add...
so stop acting like such a bitch!
...which included a word
he was not allowed to use.
The old woman then saw
Bree hodge clench her fist.
A second later,
the blind man heard a slap...
and the young boy saw
Edie grab her cheek.
As the two women parted company,
a thought occurred
to all those who had
witnessed the incident...
that right there on
peaceful wisteria lane,
the battle lines had been drawn,
and someone...
was going to get hurt.
It happens the second
sunday of every may
children purchase tasteful bouquets...
sign sentimental cards...
and create homemade jewelry...
all in an attempt to honor
that woman known simply...
as mother.
Oh!
Hey, mama. Hey, baby.
Oh, my gosh!
Is this my daughter-in-law?
Well,I'm gonna hug her.
Oh! It's nice to meet you.
Oh, my goodness! Oh!
Oh, okay.
Oh, my son was right.
You are the prettiest thing!
Michael, I'm just taken with her.
Oh, well, good. Thank you.
Come on, mama. Let's get you unpacked.
Oh, yes, let's do,'cause I
brought you a present. Oh! Oh!
Let's go. Come on.
Wow!
It's all recipes.
Not just any recipes.
Some of these have been in my family
since before the war
of northern aggression.
You mean the civil war?
I mean what I mean.
Um, well...
i guess Mike didn't tell you
that I'm, uh,
really not a cook.
Oh, no,he told me.
That's why I gave you these recipes,
and I'm gon' teach you
how to make 'em, too.
Isn't that nice, honey?
Oh, my meemaw always told me
that a lady should be
a chef in the kitchen,
a maid in the living room
and a whore in the bedroom.
And michael says you've only
got one of those covered,
so I'm gon' help you with the other two.
Excuse me.
The one she won't be helping me with-
please tell me it's "whore."
I call the computer. No way!
I called it on the bus.
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Guys, wait a minute. Wait a minute.
There's somebody I want you to meet.
This is dr. Dolan.
Hey, guys. I'm joshua.
He's gonna hang out and watch us,
you know, be a family.
Why?
Because we've had a couple of...
problems lately.
And my job is to find out
what's causing those problems,
and then I can help you be a stronger
family. Can we be a stronger family
while playing "age of empires iii"?
Yeah, sure.
I wanna learn how to play that game.
Go get started.
I'll join you in a minute.
So I like what you said
about making the family stronger,
but as I told you,
kayla's the one you wanna focus on.
Well, I prefer to look
at the big picture.
You see,
if a family is dysfunctional,
it can lead to a child with problems.
Yeah, or a child with problems
can lead to a dysfunctional family.
I mean, kayla's the one that
got my kids to light a fire
and jump off the roof.
Honey, it-it sounds like
dr. Dolan has, um,
kind of a plan here.
I understand.
It just seems like...
at $140 an hour,
we could skip straight to the part
where you sit down with kayla
and tell her to stop being so evil.
Mommy?
Yeah?
Um... I forgot to give you something.
Oh.
It's a drawing I made for you in school.
Oh, well, thank you.
It's beautiful. Thank you.
She never does this.
Mmm. Don't.
We're waiting for ellie.
She's finishing up with a customer.
Well, maybe when she's
done tattooing him,
she can put "stop hitting the
blind guy" on my forehead.
You know,I've been hitting
you a lot less lately,
and I don't feel
like I'm getting enough credit for that.
You're right.
I'm a bad husband.
No, seriously.
We're getting along better.
Have you noticed that?
Yeah, I think it's because of ellie.
Me, too. It's impossible to
argue with her in the house.
She makes us laugh.
She takes you off my hands every
once in a while. Plus, she's
always helping around the house.
I mean, yesterday,
without even being asked,
she washed all the windows.
She's amazing. I don't know
where she gets all her energy.
Okay, so we're square.
Dude, you gotta call me next week.
I got some great stuff coming in.
All right.
Ellie, it's getting cold!
I'll be right down!
So should I sneak out the back?
Oh, no. That's my landlady.
She's cool.
She knows you're dealing?
Well, she's not that cool.
Oh, hey, guys!
You were up there a while.
Can I see it?
Um, she she means the tattoo.
I would love for you to see it...
but it's kind of down south.
Oh, on his... got it.
Does it hurt?
It's okay.
Ellie gave me something for the pain.
And fairview has a
top-rated school district,
which, uh...
you'll appreciate in a couple of years.
Well, come on in. I'll show you
the inside. You go ahead, honey.
I'll wait until mark wakes
up from his nap. All right,
we'll see you in a minute.
Okay. All right...
hi! Oh, hi!
I'm Bree hodge. Lauren baxter.
Nice to meet you.
So are you thinking of
moving onto the lane?
Yes. This house is exactly
what we've been looking for.
Do you mind if I ask is
it a safe neighborhood?
Oh, yes,
the neighborhood's safe.
I wish I could say the same
for your real estate agent.
Well, what do you mean?
What is this?
You left it in the printer.
It's a house listing.
Yeah, for a house in baltimore.
Yeah, wait till you see it.
It's got a pool and a garden.
This is about dad, isn't it?
I'm doing this to protect us.
We don't need to be protected.
He's changed.
It's all an act, sweetheart.
You don't see it now,
but you will.
He's only back because
he wants something.
I don't know what exactly.
I just know we're not safe here.
Oh, sure. That's it.
Dad has some evil plan.
It couldn't be that he
wants to be in my life,
that he loves me.
He isn't capable of love, dylan.
I found that out the hard way,
and we need to leave
before you learn the
same horrible lesson.
Move if you want.
I'm staying here with my father.
But what happened?
Things were going fine.
I'm sorry.
We need another realtor.
All right.
Biscuits are the foundation
of any southern meal.
Like my meemaw used to say,
"ain't nothin' you can make
don't taste better on a biscuit."
A fount of wisdom,
your meemaw.
Uh-huh.
Well...
i really appreciate this.
Thanks, adele.
"Adele"? If you don't call me "mama,"
I'm gon' scream.
Don't do that... mama.
Now let's get started.
We're gonna need a flour sifter.
I don't have one.
Pastry cutter? Sorry.
Dough hooks?
Don't even know what they are.
That's fine. We can improvise.
Why don't you start by measuring
out our dry ingrEdients?
The flour and such?
Oh.
Michael is gonna be so happy.
After a long day of work,
he can come home to a nice,
home-cooked southern meal.
Although he also enjoys
coming home to sesame
chicken from red panda,
and they deliver.
You know, it's a shame that
michael has to work so hard.
But I guess with all the money troubles
you two have been havin'...
he told you that?
Well, we're getting past it.
Only because my son is
working himself to the bone.
You know, it wouldn't hurt for
you to get a job. I have a job.
Oh, you mean your little drawings?
Well, it's great for a
woman to have a hobby.
Personally, I decoupage,
but I'm talking about
something that pays.
Children's books pay.
Really? How much?
You know, I think, actually,
i might have those
dough hooks somewhere.
Oh, dear. I've insulted you.
Now I'm just trying to be helpful.
No, no. It's fine, adele.
Mama.
So we were sort of
surprised to get your call.
Don't you need to see
kayla a few more times
before you report back to us?
Well, before continuing with her,
i thought it might be helpful to ask you
a few questions. Oh, go ahead. Shoot.
Do you love kayla?
Lynette? Hmm?
I was talking to you.
Oh. Well... s-sure.
I've been very good to her.
That wasn't his question.
Do you have a diploma on your wall, tom?
I don't think so. Zip it.
Again, um...
do you love her?
Of course I do...
as much as I can,
given the way she joined our family.
It's just-it's complicated.
I understand. The problem is,
kayla has picked up on your ambivalence,
and she's become a very angry girl.
So what do we do?
Oh, god. Is this gonna be
one of those therapy things
where she hits me with a foam bat?
There's a bond that develops
between an infant and her mother.
You and kayla never formed that bond,
so what we need to do is recreate it.
It's called attachment parenting,
and it starts with
kayla being by your side
as often as possible.
That sounds like exactly what they need.
I mean, I don't have a
diploma or anything, but...
I'd really like to give this a try.
Whatever keeps you and
kayla close and interacting-
go to the movies, go shopping,
maybe take a little trip together,
just the two of you.
Could we revisit the foam
bat idea for just a second?
The plan sounds great, doc.
Don't worry.
I will make sure that they
are together constantly.
As me if I love tom right now.
Go ahead. I dare ya.
May I help you?
I haven't seen benjamin in a week.
I was thinking I'd take him for a few
hours. It's not really a good time.
Well, Bree, whenever I call,
it's not a good time,
so if you don't mind,
I'd like to take my son to the carnival.
Well, that sounds boring.
I know.
Why don't you take him to Edie's house,
and he can watch you give her
a dental exam with your tongue?
Bree, you don't understand.
What you saw was bad
judgment on Edie's part
and good judgment on my part.
I pushed her away.
Yes, eventually, with a big,
dopey grin on your face.
Can we please put this behind us?
I would like to take benjamin. I don't
think so. I'd hate for him to be around
when you had another
attack of delayed morality,
either with Edie or behind
the wheel of your car.
I am not having this argument.
He is my son, too.
Not exactly.
What? Don't even-
strictly speaking,
you're not even related to him.
I mean, it was fine for you
to masquerade as his father
when we were together,
but now that we're not-
this is wrong.
I will hire a lawyer.
I've already hired one.
You'll be hearing from him shortly.
Oh, and if you're in
the mood for a carnival,
why not call Edie?
I hear you get three throws
for a dollar with her, too.
Bye, Gaby.
You guys going for another walk?
Yeah.
We found this sweet hiking trail-
goes right through the middle of the
woods. Yeah, and unlike some people,
ellie doesn't let the
branches hit me in my face.
You're spoiling him.
What the hell?
Ellie, your door is locked!
Ellie!
Oh, shut up already.
Mom, guess what?
Dad's coming to my
senior recital next week.
I could swing by and pick you up,
if you want.
We could make it a real family outing.
Dylan, your father and I need to talk...
in private.
I'm not done saying good-bye.
Yes, you are.
Please get rid of that gum.
I can hear you smacking
all the way in the house.
Bye, sweetheart. Bye, dad.
Just so we're clear,
there will be no family outings.
Now, kathy,
you shouldn't be rude
to a man who still has feelings for you.
Meaning what?
You still love me?
I do.
And I know I'm somewhat to blame
for what's happened between us.
That's why I've forgiven you
for kidnapping our daughter.
The least you can do is meet me halfway.
Oh, wayne.
I don't deserve your forgiveness.
Maybe not, but I'm gonna give
it to you anyway 'cause...
i still think we could
be happy together.
Could we?
Given all the things I did
that you don't know about?
What's that?
I'm talking about all
those men I was with
while we were married.
How can you forgive something like that?
That's a lie.
You wouldn't have dared.
Unhappy women do dangerous things.
I think the worst
was when I tricked you
into thinking dylan was yours.
I wanted to tell you the truth,
but I was scared...
for obvious reasons.
I don't believe you.
But I'm not worried anymore
because you've changed.
So what are you waiting for, wayne?
Forgive me.
Hey there! Mrs. Mccluskey.
If she's not mine,
then whose is she?
Does it matter?
Oh, I guess I won't be seeing
you at the recital now.
Hmm. What a shame.
Are you sure it was cocaine?
Carlos, I was a fashion
model in the '90s.
I know cocaine.
Damn it.
What are you doing?
I'm calling the police.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Shouldn't we hear ellie's side of
the story first? Here's ellie's side.
"Selling drugs brings in more
money than waiting tables."
There you go. Were you moved?
Okay, look, maybe I was wrong.
Maybe it was flour.
Maybe she's a pastry chef.
Yeah! And she came up with
that tattoo cover story
to hide her illicit baking.
All right, look,
I know we have to do something,
but this woman's our friend.
Yes, and I'm a convicted
felon still on probation.
Now if the police find out
we're harboring a drug dealer,
they're gonna fry me.
We have to turn her in.
Well, the priority for me
is working out custody of benjamin.
To that end,I've written down
all the pertinent facts
about the situation.
No, I don't want to do
this over the phone.
Uh, listen.
I'm gonna hop in the shower.
How about we meet in your office
in about an hour? Great. Thanks.
Orson?
Orson?
The, uh,the door's open.
Edie? What are you doing here?
Get out here, you wuss.
That puritanical robot bitch of yours
is sabotaging my business.
Okay, hang on a second.
I'll be right out.
You know, uh,Orson...
forget it.
Just-just take a nice,
long shower.
Really? You sure?
Yeah.
Uh, now that I think about it,
i can handle Bree all by myself.
So that's when I saw all those
bricks of cocaine under her bed.
I mean,i-i mean,
I think it was cocaine,
and I think they're called bricks.
I'm just a simple housewife.
I don't know what I'm saying.
Well, you've done the right thing,
and it's thanks
to the cooperation of citizens like you-
yeah, yeah, yeah. When are you
gonna get her out of our house?
Well, it's a little more
complicated than that.
Meaning?
Bullock!
Oh, my god!
What? What?
I can't see anything.
It's one of ellie's customers.
Actually, I'm detective bullock.
We've been tracking miss
leonard for several months now.
Okay, so if you know what she's doing,
then why don't you just bust her?
She's small-time.
We're trying to get to her supplier,
so we need her to keep dealing.
Wait. So you're just gonna leave
a drug dealer in our house?
Yes. For now we just need you
to act normal,
pretend like you don't know anything.
We'll move in when the case is made.
Okay, look,
I'm all for doing my civic duty,
but this woman she's...
sort of a... friend.
And now you're asking us to trick her?
I'm not sure we're
comfortable with this.
Mr. Solis,
you're on probation, right?
How'd you like not to be?
What on earth could you possibly want?
Oh, I wanted to thank you.
After you scared off that couple
that were going to buy the young house,
i, uh,found another buyer,
and they're willing
to go 10% over asking.
Well, good,
when they drop by for their inspection,
I'll just have to have a nice
little chat with them, too.
You wouldn't wanna do that to me.
And after all, we're family.
Family?
Well, yes,
since my nephew austin
is benjamin's biological father,
that makes me benjy's great-aunt-
a term I don't exactly love,
but it's better than "grandma,"
which is what you are.
How did you...
cute story.
I I went over to Orson's to
ask him to get you off my back,
and the poor sap-
he-he'd written the
whole sordid tale down
and left it right there on the table.
Edie, if word got out,
my whole family would be... humiliated.
Oh, I don't want word to get out.
That would ruin everything,
because right now i...
well, I own you.
What does that mean?
Glad you asked.
From this moment on,
I am your best friend.
You're gonna invite me to
all of your fancy parties,
set me up with all your single friends,
and, well,
if I'm ever in the mood for muffins,
you're gonna bake 'em for me.
Edie... please.
And if you don't,
if for one second I don't feel the love,
I'm gonna bury you.
You understand?
Yeah.
Good.
Oh, by the way,
um,I'm having an open house tomorrow.
A plate of banana nut muffins
sure would set the mood.
Don't you think?
Oh! Oh!
Hey, honey,
could you get that? Thank you.
Hey, Bree, perfect timing.
We were just getting ready to deal
the cards. Bree, are you okay?
There's something I've been...
keeping from all of you,
and, um...
we need to talk.
Hey, wayne.
I finished that d.n.a. you wanted.
I'm probably gonna get in trouble
because I put it in front
of martin's triple homicide.
You bad girl.
Well, I owe you.
I just needed to confirm
that the vic and my suspect are related.
Oh, well, actually, they're not.
I ran the samples from the cheek swab
and the wad of gum you gave me,
and your suspect's not
related to the victim at all.
Are you sure? Mm-hmm.
Oh, yeah, it's 100% exclusion.
Are you hungry?
'Cause I worked all through lunch,
and I thought that you
and I could go get-
wayne?
Oh, my god.
And Edie threatened to use that to...
yes.
Okay, first of all, you're, like,
the greatest mom ever to wanna
protect danielle like that.
Thank you.
I can't believe she
was blackmailing you.
I can't believe she
made a play for Orson.
I can.
She went after Carlos and Mike and karl.
The only person she
hasn't gone after is tom.
Yet.
This woman is outta control.
What are you gonna do?
No. What are we gonna do?
Hey, guys, what's going on?
I told them everything, Edie,
about Orson, benjamin,
everything. You did?
She did, so you can kiss
that little blackmail scheme good-bye.
Well, I was only doing it because-
you were only doing it
because you're the devil.
Okay, fine,
chew me out and let's get on with it.
It's not like all the other times, Edie.
We're done.
Done?
We're not inviting you to poker.
We're not talking to you.
We're not even gonna
wave when you jog by.
From now on, you are invisible.
And we're gonna make sure
every woman in a 5-mile radius
knows the kind of crap you pulled.
We tried to be your friends,
but you don't even understand
what that word means,
so now we're gonna be something
you do understand.
Guys, wait. Wait.
I know I crossed a line this time,
and, well,I'm-I'm sorry.
Did you hear something?
Mnh-mnh.
Neither did i.
Over here, honey,
look at the camera.
Look at the camera.
You ready to ride, dylan?
Now look, if you're scared,
you don't have to. I want to.
No, you're a brave girl.
Hold up your arm for
the camera, sweetheart.
How many stitches is that? 11.
And you didn't cry once,
did you?
Can I ride now, please, daddy?
Of course, baby.
I love you, daddy.
Dylan, it's me.
Uh, you need to come over here tomorrow.
Yeah, I know it's mother's day,
but it's okay.
I got some things to tell
you about your mother.
Ooh, I want this one.
Oh. Yow! It's a little pricey.
But I want it. You're the one
who asked me to go shopping.
Well, I know, but we're supposed
to be spending time together,
not going into debt.
Oh.
How about this one?
What do you mean,
"supposed to"?
I just...
it's good for us to hang out.
I enjoy it.
Is this something that
the doctor made you do?
No. All my idea.
I just wanted to treat
you to a real fun day.
All right.
You want me to have fun?
Mm-hmm.
Buy me this.
Okay.
Good times.
I'd like an old-fashioned, please.
What's the matter, michael?
You tuckered out?
Oh, yeah,
I just didn't get much sleep.
Honestly, I wonder how you ever get any,
well, considering you
got Susan in the bed
sawing wood all night.
I'm doing what now?
Snoring.
What'd you say it sounded like, michael?
A bunch of bulldogs in a bag?
But it is a sound that
I've come to love.
You know what my meemaw
did to grandpa boo?
She sewed a marble in the
back of his pajama top,
then if he rolled on his
back to start snorin',
it'd wake him right up.
But I guess you can't do that,
seeing as how you sleep
in the nude and all.
Well, that's gonna change real soon.
I'm gon' fix my face before I order.
Excuse me.
Oh, this is nice.
Nice? She's driving me crazy.
You have got to stop
complaining about me to her.
I don't... complain.
Well, you could see how i,
as the nude, snoring whore,
would think so.
Okay, now I might vent a little bit,
but she's just trying to help.
Well, the next time she tries to help,
she's gonna get an
old-fashioned in her face,
so you better step up and
start defending me. Okay, okay.
Well, lovely powder room.
It's amazing that such a busy restaurant
can keep their bathroom
cleaner than yours.
Now, mama,
that's that's not very nice.
Well, you're the one who told me
you didn't marry her
for her housekeepin'.
You just need someone
to teach these things.
You know what?
Why don't I stay a few extra weeks,
and you and I can spruce the house up?
And don't worry.
I'll leave when the baby comes.
At my age, all that crying
just cuts my nerves to shreds.
Now the first thing we're gonna do...
is wash your walls.
Just 'cause we don't walk on 'em
doesn't mean they don't get dirty.
Now how do you remember that?
...science project.
Now when you used to read...
oh, my god!
My water broke. What?
My water just broke.
I'm in labor.
We have to go.
You're not due for a month.
I don't know what to tell you, mama.
Look at me.
Aah! Come on.
We have to get you to the hospital.
Well, yes, let's go.
No, no,no, you should take a
cab home and start packing.
This one feels like a crier.
Well, are you sure I should-
aah! Aah! Come on.
Aah! Aah! Aah!
Ah. Ah.
You're doing great, honey.
Just keep breathing.
How close are the contractions?
A few weeks apart.
Wanna go to the movies?
What?
I'm not in labor, okay?
But your water broke.
I saw it.
That was club soda.
Amniotic fluid doesn't have ice cubes
and a lemon wedge. What, you faked that?
I'm sorry. I panicked.
Your mother just invited herself
to stay with us for three weeks,
and you said nothing.
I had to come up with a plan.
Well, what happens if
we go home with no baby?
I didn't say it was a good plan.
Do you see the effect she has on me?
I just thank god I
wasn't drinking coffee.
I could've hurt myself.
Okay, I get it. I'll talk to her.
Thank you.
Do you wanna go back in
there right now and tell her?
No. No.
The restaurant just comped our drinks.
We'll tell her at home.
Well, we've done enough
damage for one day.
Let's go home.
I want a corn dog first.
Oh, honey,
we're about to have dinner.
But I'm hungry now.
I want a corn dog.
All right. Thank you.
If you're hungry,
I'll get you something healthy,
and you can have it in the car.
Corn. Dog.
Why can't I have one?
Well, at this point,
because of the way you're acting.
Please don't do this, kayla.
We have been having such a nice time.
And we can keep having a nice time.
Just give me what I want,
or you're not gonna like what happens.
Are you... threatening me?
I'm just saying,
i got that idiot preston
to jump off the roof.
Wonder what I could get penny to do.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have done that,
but that was...
that was horrible,
what you said.
And-and...
you should never say that again.
Okay, so...
come on. Let's go. Come on.
Oh, Susan, you're up.
Michael told me about your false labor.
That was unusual.
Well, it happens.
I know,
but usually your water doesn't break.
Oh, that. Um...
turns out I spilled some club soda.
Well, no surprise there.
Michael told me what a
klutzy kathy you are.
I'm glad he finds that cute.
I myself don't have the patience.
Hey, mama.
Hello, michael.
Do you have a mother's
day present for me?
He sure does,
but I want mine first.
Mama, we need to talk.
About what?
About the way you talk to people.
I mean, um,sometimes you can
be a little too... honest.
Sorry. Go on.
It's just...
you don't realize how things sound
when they're coming out of your mouth.
I know you mean well ohh!
I'm getting to it. No, no,no,
i-i love where this is going.
It's just that, mama,
sometimes when you're talking to Susan-
Susan, you look a little pale.
Are you okay?
Oh, she's fine.
And I wish she'd cut it out.
No,I'm not trying to-ow!
Susan?
Are-are you going into labor?
For real?
Maybe. Who cares?
Let her have it.
Okay, okay.
Mama, you've gotta stop
taking potshots at Susan.
She's my wife, and I love her,
and I can't have you upsetting her.
Sweetheart,i-i am deeply
sorry and mortified.
If-if I've caused you any distress,
i never meant to hurt your feelings.
Apology accepted. Let's go.
Oh. Whoo!
Happy mother's day!
Oh.
Oh, my gosh!
That is so sweet.
Thank you so much.
We're gonna go get your present.
Yeah.
Okay.
I hope you like turtles.
So...
no kayla?
Well, she's still pretty upset.
Again, I know I crossed the line,
and I am so sorry.
You know what?
Let's not get into this.
I'm just gonna get angry all over again.
Tom, if you had been there
and heard what she said...
it doesn't matter.
You hit her.
Honey, she's just a little girl.
And now thanks to you,
she's a frightened little girl.
Sorry to bother you,
dr. Dolan,
but you said I could call anytime.
My mom...
she hit me.
No, it's not the first time.
I was afraid to tell you
'cause I knew what she
would do if she found out.
Please help me.
I don't feel safe here.
I have to go. She's coming.
Uh, sorry about the mess.
The maid took the week off.
You said you wanted to talk to me and...
tell me things about mom?
You know what, kiddo?
I-i had kind of a bad day yesterday.
I sat around here drinking,
feeling sorry for myself.
And... and then I called you.
That's okay.
If you're feeling sad or whatever,
you should always call me.
None of this is your fault.
I hope you know that.
None of what?
I tried so hard to let
the past just be the past.
I didn't I didn't wanna bring up
who did what to who or why.
What did mom say to you?
And it turns out I've been
kidding myself all this time.
This family that I've been fighting for-
it just it doesn't even...
exist.
We don't need her.
I'm fine with just you and me.
I'm happy now.
Ow! Dad, you're hurting me.
Dad, what's the matter?
You have to go.
What's wrong?
Did I do something?
Get outta here! Now!
Ellie? Brunch is almost ready!
This is gonna be so hard.
You can't think of her as your friend.
Think of her as a drug dealer
who could've gotten us into
a lot of trouble. I'll try.
Oh! Shoot.
I wanted to surprise you.
What's this?
Well, you know,
it's mother's day, and...
i have kind of a crappy
relationship with my mom,
so...
this is my way of saying
thanks for being nicer to me
than she ever was.
Oh.
Oh, honey!
I'm glad I didn't get
you the chocolates.
No, travers, no,i decided
spending mother's day with you
is more important
than spending time showing
people stupid houses.
Oh, love you, too, sweetheart.
Actually, I think
mommy's gonna be spending
a lot more time with you from now on.
But we'll talk about that
when I get there, okay?
I love you, baby.
I'll see you soon.
It happens the second
sunday of every may.
We celebrate the women
who give us life...
and so much more.
The ones who protect us at all costs...
who have the courage to fight
those who would do us harm...
who put our happiness
ahead of their own.
But mostly...
we celebrate a mother's love,
which is constant, eternal...
and there from the very beginning.
Previously on Desperate Housewives:
Adam was finished with Katherine...
Please get rid of that gum.
but Dylan's father came back.
Bye, sweetheart.
Bye, Dad.
I tricked you into
thinking Dylan was yours.
I finished that DNA you wanted, and your
suspect's not related to the victim at all.
Gaby and Carlos were
forced to go to the police.
Are you sure it was cocaine?
Carlos, I was a fashion
model in the '90s.
I know cocaine.
Just give me what I want...
and Lynette...
or you're not gonna like what happens.
was pushed to her breaking point.
Coffee mugs to the contrary, Lynette Scavo knew
that she was not the world's greatest mother.
In fact, when it came to parenting, Lynette
had done many things she was not proud of--
like the time when she offered Parker cash
if he agreed to eat all of his spinach
or when she told the twins there was
treasure buried beneath the weeds,
or when she gave her kids a little extra
cough syrup so she could finish her novel.
But despite these lapses,
Lynette didn't think of herself as
the worst mother in the world either--
until one horrible day.
Since when do you make waffles?
Well, Kayla loves waffles, and since she
and I have been having some problems lately,
I wanted to do something nice for her.
Oh, you tell Kayla
her breakfast is ready.
My name is Fern Parrish. This is my
colleague, Irene Semanis. We're from CPS.
Uh, one sec.
Preston, you might wanna stop
dropping your waffle on the floor,
'cause I'm still gonna make you eat it.
So, uh, what's CPS?
Children's Protective Services.
For what it's worth, I keep
my floors incredibly clean.
Mrs Scavo, we recently received a
report of some abuse in your home.
Abuse? That's ridiculous.
Well, we got a call
from a Dr Joshua Dolan.
It seems he was contacted
by your daughter Kayla.
Who says you hit her... repeatedly.
Okay...
first, I'm not that kind of mom.
And second, Kayla has a
tendency to... exaggerate.
We also have a security
tape from a clothing store.
It shows you slapping a
young girl across the face.
We're assuming that's Kayla.
Have a seat. I'll be
with you in a second.
Yes, Lynette Scavo was not
the world's greatest mother.
But in her heart, she knew she
had done the best she could,
given what she had to work with.
"Lynette"- it's how the
French describe "a pretty one."
"Katherine"- coined by the
ancient Greeks, it denotes "purity."
"Gabrielle"- a Hebrew word
meaning "God is my strength."
"Bree"- it's an Irish
name that means "power."
Indeed,
every name has a single
specific meaning,
which is why parents
have trouble choosing one
for someone who means
everything to them.
What about "Philip"? I like "Philip."
Oh, I know you do.
I don't, and neither does the baby.
Philip? Oh, Phil? See?
Nothing. Not even a burp.
Here's a thought. How about "Nathaniel"?
All right, that's the fourth time you've
tried to sneak "Nathaniel" past me.
I'm putting "Peyton" back on the table.
I am not naming my son
after a quarterback.
All right, here's the
rest of my list. Lucas.
It sounds like "mucus."
Mitchum.
Like the deodorant?
Unitas.
Oh, give me that.
Well, we need new inspiration.
Riley.
I like it. Who is he?
He's a guy who...
"killed six, then self."
Well, I give up.
He's not gonna get a name.
When we want him to come, we'll
just whistle and say, "Here, boy."
Dr Conner. Paging Dr Conner.
Please call admitting.
Conner.
I love it.
Me, too.
Oh, you finally have a name.
Dr Conner Delfino.
I'm going out to the mall.
You wanna come with?
Oh, no, thanks. I gotta make sure
my handyman gets his wiring done.
He screwed it up the last time.
You realize we could've had a fire?
Sorry, Mrs Solis.
All right, then. See you later.
And... she's gone.
Great. Let's break into her room.
As soon I finish this, I'll start
placing bugs in the other rooms.
Well, isn't her room enough?
She has a prepaid cell
phone, so we can't tap it.
Our only hope at nailing her supplier is to
record every conversation she has in this house.
Well, how long is that gonna take?
We got a tip that she's
expecting a delivery this week.
So it won't be long before Miss Leonard learns the
joys of a little girl-on-girl action in a prison shower.
Okay, first of all, you're a pig.
Second of all, don't say things
like that. Ellie's my friend.
Yeah, well, your friend is
a drug dealer, I.e. scum.
You don't even know her.
Okay, yes, she's made some bad choices,
but deep down, she's a good person.
Yeah, well, deep down,
I hope she rots in jail.
Okay, when this thing is over, let's
not do the whole Christmas card thing.
Is that your husband?
No, he's at Braille school.
Gaby?
Oh, Ellie!
What the hell are you doing in my room?
We weren't expecting you back so soon.
I forgot my wallet.
Again, what the hell
are you doing in my room?
Well, we needed some privacy.
See, Roy and I are lovers.
You're having an affair
with your handyman?
I know, it's crazy.
You wouldn't believe the passion.
I mean, I was powerless to resist.
Just- just get
out of my room.
Okay, okay. We're going.
That's for using your tongue.
Lots of people do missionary work, but few have
the guts to smuggle bibles into North Korea.
It is my distinct pleasure to
welcome back, after four long years--
Reverend Michael Green.
Thank you for that
glorious introduction, Joe.
Well, it's good to be back.
Now if you'll all please stand and
offer each other the lord's peace.
Peace be with you, Bree.
I reject your peace, and I
demand you stop stalking me.
I'm doing no such thing.
Really? So I just happen to run into you at the
dry cleaner, the greengrocer, the post office?
We shared a life together.
It's only natural we'd
frequent the same places.
Oh, please. I saw you at my nail salon.
There's nothing in the bible that
says a man can't enjoy a nice pedicure.
Orson, hear me when
I say this. It's over.
You have done unconscionable things
for which I can never forgive you,
and no amount of flitting about in my
peripheral vision is going to change that.
But there must be something I can do.
You know I've repented.
We--we can get past this.
I know no such thing. Now be
quiet. I'm done talking to you.
Bree, so nice to see you again.
Peace be with you.
And also with you.
Do not give this man peace.
You shouldn't keep your
doors unlocked, Kathy.
Why do you think they call 'em
"crimes of opportunity"?
What do you want?
Dylan used to have a big old scar
right here, and now it's gone.
I'm just curious how
you would explain that.
Never too early to
start drinking, is it?
She fell off her bike.
11 stitches. I remember.
I took her to a plastic surgeon in Chicago
'cause I didn't want her to feel self-conscious.
Well, that's pretty convenient.
What are you suggesting, Wayne?
Something's not right.
I felt it from the moment
that I laid eyes on her.
I just don't see myself in her at all.
I told you. She's not yours.
Yeah, but I don't see you in her either.
So...
let's just settle this once and forll.
Take a DNA test.
All I need is one strand of hair.
Knock, knock. Is this a bad time?
No, not at all.
Great, because we are here to
throw ourselves on your mercy.
We are having a commitment ceremony in
five days, and our caterer just canceled.
We know it's short notice.
Totally understand if you say no.
Nonsense. I'd love to do it.
Why don't you have a seat,
and we'll talk details?
I'm sorry if... you're busy,
can come back later.
No, no. No, that's okay. You stay.
I'll come back later.
Lynette, I'm sorry.
When I'm told about a suspected case of
child abuse, I am bound by law to report it.
Okay, so what happens now?
I'm just trying to help
CPS finish their investigation.
They'll interview your kids, their
teachers, possibly some of your neighbors.
My neighbors? God!
I could strangle that girl.
Honey, you might wanna stop
saying things like that.
Look, for the next few days,
let Tom handle the kids.
Any other problems between you and Kayla
could jeopardize custody of all your children.
Wait. They could take my children?
No one's taking anyone.
You have got to be kidding me!
This is all a big misunderstanding.
I'm sure that we can work this out.
So what do I need to do to keep my kids?
Well, there are a lot
of things you can do.
First, no physical discipline...
Bob liked the idea of the
onion and white asparagus tart.
Wonderful! With a little goat cheese.
Oh, and Lee asked for stuffed mushrooms.
Those with roasted green
beans as our side dishes.
Nice tight grouping.
You are not rusty at all.
Thank you. Felt good.
Although I always, uh,
like a trip to the range,
is there any particular reason
we came here for party planning?
Well, with Adam gone, I've
just been feeling a little...
uneasy lately.
It's funny how having a man in
the house can make you feel safer,
no matter how retiring or
easily spooked he might be.
That's true.
I just need to feel that if an intruder
broke in, I could take care of it...
effectively.
You really want to be effective?
Try hollow points.
These rounds you've got punch straight
though, but a hollow point blooms on impact,
cuts the body to shreds from the inside.
Sounds exactly like what I need.
Now... let's talk desserts.
I just got a call from
my mom. My grandpa died.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
I know how much you loved him.
Well, actually, I've
been thinking about it.
I know we settled on "Conner," but I'd, uh,
I'd like to name our son after my grandfather.
Well, yeah, um, I mean, "Conner" is
just a name we picked out of thin air.
This would mean something.
So you're okay with this?
Think it's a beautiful way
to honor your grandfather.
I mean, "James" wouldn't be my first
choice, but it's a good, solid name.
No, grandpa James is my dad's
dad. This is my mom's- Maynard.
Oh, right. Maynard.
Oh, that's awful... that he died.
Why didn't we think of this before?
It's such a beautiful Southern name.
Oh, and rare, really rare.
And you're right. It's a great
way to honor my grandfather.
Yeah. I said that, didn't I?
Oh, shoot. We can't do it.
Isn't your grandpa James
significantly older than grandpa Maynard?
Shouldn't we honor him first?
But grandpa James isn't dead.
You sure? It's worth a phone call.
Actually, I've got a cousin who's named
after him already, so we're covered.
Thank you, Susan. This
really means a lot.
I'm gonna go call my mom.
Forgive me.
don't look at me like that.
His grandfather just died.
Lunch is almost ready.
I'm making your favorite.
I take it you're still mad at me.
Well, yeah. I just don't get
why you broke into my room.
Well, I couldn't risk
doing it in my room.
Ever since Carlos went blind, he's
developed a strong sense of smell.
I don't know if you happened to catch a
whiff of Roy, but that is one telltale odor.
Well, that's another thing, you know?
What do you see in that guy?
Uh, you know, he's a handyman.
He knows how to... get in there...
and make stuff work.
But he's a zero, and
Carlos is so fantastic.
don't you love him?
Of course I do.
Carlos Solis is the love of my life.
But, you know, sometimes you get bored,
and a big, greasy, disgusting
handyman really hits e spot.
Adam, what the- you
scared me half to death.
Sorry. I let myself in.
Why?
Dylan told me Wayne's back.
Why didn't you call me?
Because I'm handling it.
Yeah, she told me about
the shooting range, too.
You sure that's the
best way to handle it?
Adam, you made it very clear
that you were done with me.
But I'm not done with Dylan, and
if Wayne's back, then I'm gonna protect her.
So maybe I should pay him a
little visit, scare him off.
If you'd ever met
Wayne, you'd know better.
Well, then let's get Dylan out of town.
I tried. She said she's not leaving.
Well, I...
I promised her a trip for graduation, just
the three of us, anywhere she wanted to go.
Okay. But what happens
when the trip's over?
Won't we just be at square one again?
Not if we don't come back.
Oh, Susan. He's adorable.
he's so precious.
So it's been two days now.
Did you and Mike finally land on a name?
Maynard.
Maynard?
Interesting.
It has a very distinct ring.
Okay, drop the act, ladies.
I hate it, too.
Mike insisted that we name
him after his dead grandfather.
How did he die? Was he beaten to death
'cause his name was Maynard?
I know. It's terrible,
but I can't change it now.
Mike was so emotional about it.
Well, then appeal to
his sense of reason,
because the name "Maynard" doesn't
go with the name of "Delfino."
One is German and the other is Italian, and we all
know what happens when those folks get together.
Well, I'm not sure that
the World War II argument is gonna fly.
Come on. You have to do something.
I mean, that name is
practically abusive.
Yeah, think about your son.
People live up to the
names they're given.
If my parents hadn't named me "Gabrielle,"
who knows if I'd be this pretty?
I guess that's why they
didn't name you "Einstein."
So sarcastic, but what would
you expect from a "Lynette"?
What? If your name was "Francesca,"
you wouldn't have time for sarcasm.
You'd be too busy having sex on a Vespa.
You're right. My son's future is at stake.
I have to do something.
Maybe not. We call Gabrielle "Gaby."
I mean, perhaps there's a shortened
version of "Maynard" you could live with.
Yeah. Which says "kick my
ass" less- "may" or "nerd"?
what's going on?
Lynette Scavo,
I'm placing you under arrest.
What? Why?
Wh--for what?
Kayla showed us the
burn mark on her arm.
Burn mark? What burn mark?
You see? She doesn't know anything about this.
Okay, sir.
Now please, if we could just go back and talk about this...
That's enough. Sir, enough!
Ma'am, you're gonna
have to come with us.
Tom.
Okay, you know what? I'm gonna go call the attorney.
I--okay. Look, look,
I-I will come with you.
Please, just don't handcuff
me in front of my children.
Well, you should have thought of
that before you hurt one of them.
Lynette Scavo, you have
the right to remain silent.
If you give up that right, anything you say can
and will be used against you in a court of law.
You have the right to have an
attorney present during questioning.
If you do not have one, we
will appoint one for you.
Well, I'd--I'd be delighted
to speak to them, Bree.
Perhaps I can tell 'em the story about the
time I evaded the North Korean border patrol
by hiding in a pile of oxen dung.
they'll love that.
This is gonna be the
best seniors' brunch ever.
I'm so glad you're back.
Between you and me, Reverend Sykes tended to
pander to the congregation's progressive element.
I prefer your more muscular
brand of christianity.
Well, thank you, Bree.
I thought of you also.
I'm so sorry to hear about Rex's passing,
but I understand that you remarried.
I did, but, um, I'm afraid
it hasn't worked out.
It's been rough.
For what it's worth,
I know how you feel.
When Carolyn left me, the
loneliness was crippling.
I didn't know she left you.
Yes, for our Korean grocer.
I'll tell you, sometimes this merciful
God of ours has one sick sense of humor.
Hartman, table for four, 7:30.
See you then.
Table for one?
Yes.
Scavo's.
Is everything all right?
Oh, this is a bit awkward, but
my soon-to-be ex just walked in.
He's been following me everywhere.
For Ace, 8:30 pm. All right.
Would you mind terribly
if I took your hand?
Maybe that way, he'll finally
get the idea that I've moved on.
My hand is at your service.
Right this way, Sir.
Will you be needing a wine list?
Actually, I...
think I'll be needing a new restaurant.
Ah, it worked. Thank you for that.
It was my pleasure.
The bail bondsman said he has to run a
credit check, then he'll wire the money.
So after you've been
processed, you can leave.
And go where?
I can't get within 500 feet
of my children.
Are you not up to speed on
The People vs Lynette Scavo?
We'll figure something out.
Mrs Scavo, it's time to go.
No, you'll figure something
out. I have to go back to my cell.
Honey, I am so sorry about this.
Look it, just hang in there.
It's only gonna be a couple
more hours at the most.
How can you talk like that?
What else has to happen for
you to get what's going on here?
I do get it.
But Kayla's my daughter, so I'm trying to
deal with this in a way that protects our family.
No, you are trying to stay on the fence
while I fight to stop Kayla from destroying us.
But look around you, Tom.
Look where I am!
You have got to do something now.
Fix this.
Well, thank you for a
lovely evening, Bree.
You know, it's funny.
I don't think I'll be able to look at you
as just another parishioner anymore.
Now, now. We mustn't play favorites,
although I will take that as a compliment.
Well, take this as a compliment as well.
Your eyes glimmer like the
Yalu river on a moonlit night.
How, um, colorfully put.
what does that mean?
I want you.
Reverend Green!
When you took my hand in that restaurant, I could
feel the electricity, and I know you felt it, too.
No, I told you. I was only
trying to send a message to my ex.
Oh, please. There's always
been sexual tension between us,
Ever since Palm Sunday 1996, when
we both reached for the same frond.
No!
Bree, if I took no for an answer, Kangwon
province would still have 242 unsaved souls.
Well, now you're sending
out mixed signals.
Then let me send you a clear one.
I am not attracted to you.
Oh, nice.
First you use me, then you reject me,
and now you're insulting me?
Maybe you should go now, Mrs Hodge.
Oh, Reverend Green,
please don't be upset.
Shoot!
Ellie, can you help me for a sec?
Sure. What'S...
I spilled my milk again.
don't worrY. I'll clean it up.
God, I'm so sick of knocking crap over.
I don't know how Gaby puts
up with me. She's a saint.
Yeah, well...
"Well," what?
Hey, sweetie.
Hey, whore!
Excuse me?
I know all about your
affair with the handyman.
Ellie told me everything.
that little snitch.
I can't believe she did that!
Well, thanks for letting me know.
Uh, hello?
Are we even gonna talk about this?
Yeah, the second that bitch gets
home, I'm gonna let her have it.
Boy, you trust someone,
and they just betray you.
It sucks, you know?
Yeah, I know!
Gaby, you cheated and you got caught.
Now will you please hand me a plate
so I can smash it against the wall?
Oh, you moron! There was no affair!
That was the cop.
Ellie caught us putting
the bug in her room.
That was just an excuse
we used as a cover.
And you expect me to believe that?
I got news for you, Carlos.
You're blind.
You don't have a choice anymore.
You have to believe what I tell you.
Just like when I hand you the deodorant,
you have to believe it's not oven cleaner.
I know it's not fair.
I know it gives me
absolute power, but tough.
You're screwed. Deal with it!
Are we good?
Okay.
Thank you.
Now please, I just lost a friend.
Stop being so insensitive.
Pastor Joe. I noticed that
there are no programs.
Oh, yes. Reverend Green decided to
change today's scripture reading.
It's going to be Colossians 3:5.
Oh, he wants to talk
about sexual promiscuity?
Well, it was a last minute thing.
He came in this morning muttering about some
"redheaded harlot" in our midst who needs to be unmasked.
I don't know. I was just so relieved he was
off the Koreans, I didn't ask questions.
Excuse me a minute.
Hello.
Sorry. I know this is a bad time.
Aren't you Bree Hodge's ex-husband?
No, I'm her current husband, and I need
to speak to you about today's sermon.
They're a little late getting started.
I know, and Reverend Green is usually
such a stickler for punctuality.
Well, I don't mean to be rude, but I don't
think my sermon is any of your business.
Let me put it this way.
If you say anything about Bree,
you and I are gonna have a problem.
Well, I'm sorry you feel that way,
but I think it's my duty
as pastor to warn my flock
when a temptress sits among us.
Now if you'll excuse me.
What the hell's the matter with you?
I'm not going to let you go out there
and trash that good woman's name.
"Good woman"? She led me on.
Who are they talking about?
She's a flame-haired Jezebel!
You're insane!
She is the most moral person I know!
I have no idea.
Now if you'll please excuse me.
Would a moral person lead a man on and then humiliate him?
I don't care what she did to you.
I am not going to let you publicly
declare that Bree Hodge is a slut!
Oh, dear Lord.
Then again, I suppose I could
preach about tolerance today.
Orson. Orson.
Hello, Maynard.
I love you, Maynard.
My sweet little... May-May.
Mamie.
Nerd.
Hello.
I need to change the name on
my baby's birth certificate.
Okay, last name?
Delfino, Maynard.
Where's the father?
You both need to sign this.
Working. Busy, busy, busy.
Uh, but he told me to tell you
that he's totally cool with it.
Well, I'm busy, busy, busy, too.
So when he's available, you can come on back,
and we'll make the change.
Okay.
I'm just gonna level with you.
My husband picked the name,
and I think it's horrible,
and I know over time, he's gonna agree.
I don't care. Rules are rules.
You gotta help me out here.
I'm just trying to protect my child.
I don't want him to go through life
saddled with the name "Maynard."
I don't see what the big deal is.
Well, of course, you
don't. You're Vanessa.
You went through life
with a beautiful name.
That's why you have such a
crackerjack personality.
I think we're done here.
I have a couple errands to run.
Will you cover for me?
No problem.
Thanks, Griselda.
Griselda...
that must have been a tough name
to take out on the playground.
Yeah. Actually, it was.
We should talk.
I'm, uh, here to check on Orson Hodge.
An ambulance brought him
in less than an hour ago.
Are you family?
I'm his wife.
Well, he's going to be fine.
The's no concussion, but the doctors do
wanna keep him here for a couple of hours.
Should I tell him that you're here?
No, that's all right. Let him rest.
But please take excellent care of him.
He's a good man.
Gaby, can I talk to you?
About how you snitched on me to Carlos?
No, thanks. I'm all caught up on that.
I'm sorry, but I know from experience
what cheating can do to people.
Let me guess.
This story ends with you throwing your
boyfriend's varsity jacket in the lake?
When I was 13, my dad caught my mom
having an affair, and he walked out on us.
We had nothing, okay?
My mom went crazy, and
I ended up on the street.
To survive, I...
I had to do a bunch of
stuff that I'm not proud of.
Oh, Ellie, I'm so sorry.
I had no idea.
What have we got here?
That's our guy.
The point is, the one bad
decision can me up a lot of lives,
and I just don't want that to happen
to you and Carlos, 'cause I love you guys.
Yes?
Supplier's coming your way.
We're gonna arrest them
both, so get out of there now.
Okay. Bye.
Anyway, I didn't mean to
get into a whole thing.
I just wanted to say I'm sorry.
The cops are coming. Go.
What?
Police! Drop the bag! Drop the bag!
Hands behind your head.
It's a sting. Go out the back now.
Adam!
Mom said you were coming tonight.
Oh, I wouldn't miss it for the world...
So you better be on your A game.
Okay.
And we're all going
out to dinner afterwar.
Adam wants to tell you about
your graduation present.
What? What is it?
No, no, no. You gotta wait,
but I'll give you a clue.
I hope your
passport's up-to-date.
Yeah, no.
It's--it's okay, Andrew.
You can, uh, you can just--
you can finish it in the morning.
Great. See ya. Bye.
Need some help with that?
I didn't think you liked puzzles.
I can give it a shot.
I need to talk to you...
about Lynette.
I'm soy I had to call Dr Dolan,
daddy, but she scares me.
Yeah. You said that before,
but here's the thing.
They're gonna let Lynette
go soon, and when they do,
you guys aren't gonna be able to
live in the same house anymore.
You--you know
that, right?
So where is she gonna live?
Like, in a hotel or something?
She lives here, Kayla, with
me and the boys and Penny.
This is her home.
But--
But don't worry. We're gonna
find you a nice place to live.
Daddy, I don't wanna go anywhere.
I wanna stay here with you.
I don't have a choice, Kayla.
I need to keep you safe.
But I made it all up.
I lied about everything.
I burned myself.
And why would you do that, Kayla?
I hate her.
And it's so much better
when it's just us.
I see.
And you'll explain all this to the police
and Dr Dolan and everybody, right?
Yes, promise.
And then I can stay, right?
No, sweetie. No.
What you did was horrible,
and I can't trust you anymore.
Then I'm gonna keep lying to everybody.
You don't want that, do you?
Did you get all that, Dr Dolan?
I'm gonna go stretch my legs
and check my service real quick.
Okay, but intermission's only ten minutes.
Yeah.
Excuse me.
Could you give me a hand?
What's up?
Nail in my tire.
I gotta change it now 'cause I need
to leave after my daughter's solo.
I'm--I'm catching
a red-eye.
Yeah, sure. I can help.
Oh, thanks. I'm right over here.
This thing's really flat.
Usually with a nail,
you get a slow leak.
Yeah. I'm lucky I even made it here.
Well, I got this. You grab the spare.
My daughter's the one that plays the
cello. Which one is your daughter?
That the other thing
I need your help with.
Oh, honey, can you get all my
toiletries out of the bathroom?
What are those?
Well, it's cute, aren't they?
It's a hospital tradition.
Get them out of here now.
Why?
Because my husband is
terrified of balloons.
He was once molested by a clown.
Oh, my gosh.
Oh, I got it.
What's going on?
I'm sorry, sir. We didn't
know about the clown.
Why does that say "Conner"?
Is that what it said?
We had "Maynard" ones printed up, but
Mrs Delfino... went to the records office...
Susan... what's going on?
Well... I hate the name "Maynard."
Really? I like it-
Get out.
I'm sorry. I...
I just want our kid to have a great name.
I don't think "Maynard" is great.
You wanna know what is great?
My grandfather...
started the first integrated
elementary school in Tennessee.
And you know what else is great?
When my dad went to prison, the
state wanted to put me in the system.
My grandfather wouldn't let 'em.
He took in my mom and me
and sacrificed everything
just to make sure we had a great life.
I didn't know about that.
Susan, I don't want to
just give our son a name.
I want to give him
someone to live up to.
Maynard.
Let's hope he's worthy.
Well, that part's up to us.
Well, that's all of her things.
Well, we should probably get going, hmm?
We found a hotel with
a pool for tonight.
Maybe you and grandpa can go swimming.
Sheila, can I talk to her for a sec?
Honey, I know this is hard on you.
but I'm gonna come visit you at
grandpa and grandma's all the time.
So it's not like it's good-bye forever.
Kayla...
I'm sorry how everything turned out.
No, you're not.
Okay, then.
I love you, baby.
Have a safe trip.
Daddy! I'm sorry!
Daddy, I'm sorry! Please!
Daddy! Please!
What's in a name?
Do the labels we attach to people
tell us everything we need to know?
If we say she's just a child,
does this mean she's truly innocent?
Does calling her a drug
dealer prove she's purely evil?
Will a man known as "preacher"
always practice what he preaches?
Can a man branded a villain
possess the qualities of a hero?
The truth is, a name can never
really tell you who someone is...
Who are you?
any more than it can tell
you what they're capable of.
I'm Wayne Davis...
and we're about to have some fun.
It had been 14 years since Katherine
Mayfair had been in a police station,
but she remembered the
conversation like it was yesterday.
Would you like some water, honey?
Thanks.
So...
I take it this isn't the first
time your husband's hit you?
He keeps promising to stop,
but it just gets worse.
And I'm afraid he's gonna do
something to my daughter.
Please, you have to help me.
Have you reported him before?
Once, but when I called, they said
they couldn't find the paperwork.
Your husband's Wayne
Davis, one of our patrolmen.
Want some advice?
Wayne's got a lot of
friends around here.
Of course you can press charges, but...
I can't guarantee that one of his
friends won't lose the paperwork again.
Then what should I do?
Get as much money as you can lay
your hands on, grab your daughter...
and run.
And so she did...
to a place she thought would be safe.
Mrs Mayfair?
I'm detective Romslo. Can I help you?
Why exactly would you think
that Dr Mayfair was kidnapped?
No one in the school parking lot
heard or saw anything suspicious.
That's because the man
responsible for this--my ex--
knows a little something
about how to commit a crime.
He's a cop.
What's his name?
Wayne Davis.
What?
Well, it's just, uh...
I know Wayne.
We've hung out together.
He's a hell of a golfer.
Well, believe me when I tell you
he wasn't a hell of a husband.
Is that what this is about?
Some payback for an
ancient domestic dispute?
Please. You have to do something.
Because once Wayne is done with
Adam, he's going to come after me.
And this time, he's
gonna kill me. I know it.
I'll look into it.
If you would just, uh,
fill out this paperwork...
in that moment, Katherine knew
exactly what she had to do...
again.
Mom, stop. You're not making any sense.
There's no time. Wayne is coming.
He took Adam. We're next.
But why? Why would he do that?
And if we're in so much danger,
then why aren't we calling the police?
The police will not help.
Dylan, please! Go pack your things.
We need to be gone before he gets here.
Stop!
I'm not going anywhere until
you tell me what's going on.
Why do I have to be afraid of my father?
Katherine Mayfair had been running
from the truth for a long time...
Okay. I'll tell you.
No!
Dylan. Dylan, I'm sorry.
I had no choice!
No!
Dylan!
and it had finally caught up with her.
There's a ritual my friends
have observed for years.
Once a week, they meet to play a
game of cards and talk about their lives.
There's always laughter and wine...
and talk about the neighbors.
No way, Bree. I don't want Katherine
in our games. She bums me out.
Oh, I'm with Gaby.
I mean, you know me.
I always like to give people
the benefit of the doubt...
no, you don't.
No, I don't, but let's say I did.
Katherine has this aloof quality.
It's like she's always trying
to keep us at arm's length.
Well, I have to agree. She's changed.
She's not that fun anymore.
Ladies, I don't know
what you're talking about.
Katherine has all sorts
of wonderful qualities.
Name one, and keep in mind that "aloof"
and "unfun" have already been taken.
Well, I admit she plays
her cards close to the vest,
but some of you could benefit
from that kind of quiet dignity,
Miss I-chew-gum-like-a-1930s-gun-moll.
Bree, you can talk Katherine up all you want,
but she is just never gonna be one of us.
Anybody home?
We were just talking about you.
Random chitchat, nothing specific.
That's nice.
Could I talk to you for a minute?
What's going on?
Okay, I know it's last minute,
but I have to leave town,
so I'm not gonna be able to help
you cater the commitment ceremony.
It's tomorrow!
A hundred gay men are descending on this
street, and they're expecting a fabulous party.
I feel awful, but I wouldn't bail
on you if it weren't important.
Okay. Well, what's going on?
I can't tell you. Again, I'm so sorry.
Good luck.
All right, you can all wipe
those smug looks off your faces,
because every one of you
has just become my employee.
Hey, got any plans tomorrow at 5:00 am?
'Cause now you do.
Bree needs about two truckloads
of flowers picked up from...
What?
Guess who got off the
wait list at Princeton!
Oh my God. Oh my God!
I'm so proud of you!
Okay, I am going to need
a bumper sticker right away
so I can start annoying
all the other parents!
Sure. I'll snag you one
when I get there on tuesday.
Tuesday? What are you talking about?
Okay, you know that professor
who read my senior thesis?
Well, he was so impressed that he asked
me to come out and do a summer internship.
I'm leaving next week.
Next week?
W-well, that is a big... no.
No? Mom, I have to. It's a huge honor.
Yes... to be chosen,
and you have been chosen.
So congratulations,
and you're staying home.
Oh, you're not letting her go?
But it's a huge honor.
Yes, we've established that.
It's huge. It's an honor.
We get it.
Give me one good reason why I can't go.
Well, the first thing
off the top of my head...
we can't afford it.
Susan, can I talk to you for a sec?
You know, I just inherited 5 grand
from grandpa Maynard, and I...
I'd really like to help Julie do this.
Mike, that is so sweet.
Mike makes another good point.
Who is this professor? I don't know him.
I am certainly not going to give
my daughter to him for a summer.
I'm sorry, Julie. This is not happening.
This totally sucks.
Well, yes, but don't forget--
it is a huge honor.
You know what we haven't
done in a really long time?
Made 250 mini pizzas in one afternoon.
What are you talking about?
Bree's in a horrible jam, and I told her we'd
help cater the commitment ceremony tomorrow.
I can't. I'm busy, remember?
I'm taking this stuff to Kayla, my daughter
who lives four and a half hours away now.
Okay, so at the risk of cracking these
eggshells I've been walking on all week,
any idea when you're
gonna stop being so angry?
I'm not angry at you.
'Cause you know we
didn't have a choice, Tom.
We had to get her out of the house.
I know. I am angry at the situation.
Can you please just let me be angry?
Fine.
You can be as angry and
sulky and pissy as you want,
just so long as you're here tomorrow,
helping me crank out 250 mini pizzas.
You know, I've been told that some wives ask their
husbands for favors and actually say, "please."
Oh, Tom. don't you know an
urban myth when you hear one?
Okay, so here's the deal.
Bree needs all of these wedding
favors wrapped by tomorrow,
and she's really counting on me, so...
I'm gonna need you to hurry.
I just got off the phone
with the credit card company.
Do you have something
that you wanna tell me?
Well, it would be easier
if I knew what you knew.
Damn it, Gaby, enough shopping!
You've maxed out every
credit card we own.
I mean, we are so broke right now, it's gonna
be a miracle if we don't end up on the street.
Okay, when you yell at me, I get upset.
And you know what I do
when I get upset? I shop.
So if we do end up homeless,
guess whose fat it'll be.
Whatever. I'm gonna go read porn...
In braille.
Hello?
Gaby, it's Ellie.
Ellie, you can't call me!
The cops are all over my ass because
they think I helped you escape.
I'm sorry. I just need one more favor,
and then I'll never bother you again.
Ellie, I don't know. What is it?
I left my teddy bear in the coat closet.
I need you to bring it to me.
Teddy bear? What is that,
code for "a pound of blow"?
No, it's an actual teddy bear.
My dad gave it to me when I was 5, and it's
the only thing I have left to remember him by.
Crap.
Ya had to play the daddy card.
So after the ceremony,
we'll open up the buffet...
Uh, chicken masala,
and pasta for the vegetarians.
And dancing, roll out the cake,
you leave for your honeymoon,
and I will collapse in a tasteful heap.
Hold it. You dn't say anything
about the ice sculpture.
Yes, I'm sorry.
One cherub, delivered at 1:30.
Cherub?
No, I specifically told Katherine we
were gonna go with the enchanted castle.
And I told her we'd go with the cherub
because we are not 8-year-old girls.
Bob, all my life I have dreamt
of having a wedding reception
in which I would serve drinks from a vodka moat
surrounding an enchanted castle rendered in ice,
and I don't think
that's too much to ask.
Remember when you asked me to tell you
when you start acting like Faye Dunaway
from the boardroom scene
in "Mommie Dearest"?
Uh, why don't I let
you two work this out?
Fine, we'll go with
the stupid baby angel.
I need some coffee.
Why are you here?
And don't say for the pizza, because
I know you're lactose-intolerant.
I heard Katherine left you in the lurch.
I'm here to offer my assistance.
Oh, I get it. So I'm desperate and vulnerable,
and you're gonna swoop in and save the day.
Well, thank you very much. I'm fine.
Darling, don't be stubborn.
You're gonna need place cards, and
you know I have excellent penmanship.
Don't you dare throw your calligraphy skills
in my face when you know I'm at a low point.
Now go! And stop following me.
You're doomed.
Excuse me?
The way you just caved
on that sculpture thing?
You're setting the tone
for your entire marriage.
I am?
Yeah. You gotta dig in your heels.
Otherwise, you're gonna be
pushed around for the next...
Let's see. How long have I been married?
Ten and a half years.
I want my castle.
Lee...
it is the only thing I've asked
for, and damn it, I'm entitled to it.
Fine.
Thank you.
All right, so I will call the
ice sculptor and see if we can--
Forget it.
We're sticking with the cherub.
And later, when he bitches about
it, I'll just buy him some jewelry.
You sure you haven't been married before?
Hey, Gaby?
Over here, Carlos.
You know, I got a theory as to why
all this bad stuff has happened to us--
my blindness and losing all our money...
it's karma.
You know, we've been selfish and greedy,
and the universe is telling us
to start being better people.
I just found $118,000
in Ellie's teddy bear.
Hey, universe? Bite me!
Hello?
Hey, Wayne?
It's Pete Romslo.
Pete! How's tricks?
Listen, uh, I'm just calling
to give you a heads-up.
Um, I finally met your ex.
She came in to file a report.
Apparently, you, uh,
kidnapped her husband.
No kidding? Am I asking for ransom?
Well, you always said she was crazy.
Now I feel your pain.
Anyway, I-I just thought
you should know, huh?
Take care.
Thanks.
Okay, enough kiddin' around.
Tell me where my daughter is.
Oh, for--
did you die on me?
Damn it!
Okay, so you have another one
of those in the truck? Thank you.
I'll be back in ten minutes!
We need more settings on five, please.
Lynette, I wish I had time to
be more tactful, but I don't.
Your swan is pathetic, and I'm
firing you from napkin duty.
No, no, give me another chance.
I will get it.
yes? Oh, there you are!
Where is my ice sculpture?
No! No, 6:00 is too late.
I need it now.
Oh, forget it.
I'll pick it up myself.
Why don't you fill water glasses?
That's an important job, too.
Andrew... look, I'm on my way back,
but it's imperative that you...
Andrew? Oh, dear God.
Oh, no. Don't die on me now!
oh, dear God.
Help me! Help!
I'm just saying we should pay off all
of our bills and put the rest in savings.
Savings? Nobody does that anymore.
Well, I mean, you never know.
We might have kids.
Oh, Carlos, we're never gonna have kids.
Shoes are my kids.
Let me be the mother I was meant to be.
Hello?
Where's my bear?
Right. The bear.
Well... I looked all over
and just couldn't find it.
I guess the cops took it.
I'm really sorry, Ellie.
I know it was a gift from your dad.
It just breaks my heart.
You found the money, didn't you?
Money? What money?
You're lying.
I can hear it in your voice.
What's wrong with my voice?
Okay, listen, bitch.
You do not wanna screw with me.
How about we split it 50-50?
I'm coming to get my money,
and if one dime is missing,
I will throw acid in your face.
Okay, we really need to get caller ID.
What more can you do to me?
Need a lift?
Is, uh, Dylan here by any chance?
Uh, um, no, I-I haven't seen her.
Okay. Thanks.
Hey, Katherine, are you all right?
Dylan and I, we... had a big fight.
Well, I'm sure she's just upset, and
she'll come home after she cools off.
Not this time. I lied to her.
Well... we all lie to
our kids sometimes, right?
I've been doing it her whole life- one
lie on top of another- and the thing...
I learned too late is that eventually
they all come crashing down on you.
Anyway, if you see her, let me know?
Thanks.
What's your hurry, Kathy?
What happened to my daughter?
I'm not telling you anything,
so you might as well kill me.
I don't care.
I believe you. I do.
But what about Dylan?
Or should I say, that girl
that lives here with you?
I bet you'd care if I killed her.
There are no wings.
Yes, and the Venus de Milo is
missing two arms. What's your point?
It's... stunning.
well, I suppose I should say thank you.
Oh, it's no big deal.
You're just lucky I was there.
Was I lucky, or were you following me?
I thought you might need my help.
And you were right. I did.
You just think I'm being
stubborn, don't you?
Making you jump through hoops when
it's so clear we belong together.
I don't think anything, Bree.
I'm just trying to be there for you
and hoping eventually you'll forgive me.
But that's just it, Orson.
If I forgive you, then I
forgiving what you did to Mike.
I can't do that.
And- and you
wouldn't want me to.
I mean, be honest with yourself.
If I took you back now, I
wouldn't be the woman you love.
Then what can I do?
I've already told you. Turn yourself in to
the police and let justice run its course.
I can't do that, Bree.
I want to, for you, more than anything.
But I don't think I could survive it.
Well... so here we are.
what is this?
It's your ice sculpture.
No, it's not.
I see no turrets. I see no flags.
I see no moat full of vodka.
What I see is a giant,
icy slap in the face.
Bob!
What's that?
I want to be able to reach you this
summer when you're doing that internship.
You changed your mind?
Here's the thing.
You and I have always had kind
of an unconventional relationship,
and the reason that worked was because
we always tell each other the truth...
until yesterday.
Julie, I lied about not having
enough money to send you.
Why?
Because I just freaked
out about you leaving.
But you knew I was
going away to college.
Yes, in the fall.
And I needed those extra
three months to get ready. I...
I still have not figured out
how I'm gonna get by without you.
Mom...
seriously...
I just lean on you in
ways you don't even know.
I think you are stronger than
you give yourself credit for.
Well... I spend more time with
me than you do, and I'm a mess.
Well, you were when dad left.
I had my hands full then.
But you've grown so much
these last five years.
Really?
You are a secure, confident woman now.
You're ready to spread
your wings and fly.
Frankly, my work here is done.
Thanks.
Now I want you to have that
phone on you at all times...
because I'm still not sure
how to work the dishwasher.
Can you help me?
For God sake, Lee!
It's just an ice sculpture!
It is not "just an ice sculpture"!
It's the sculpture and
making me move to the suburbs
and forcing me to be nice to your homophobic boss.
You know what? Tom's right.
If I don't start standing
up for myself, I'm doomed.
I don't believe
I used the word "doomed."
You're always overruling me.
You treat me like a child.
Well, I've had it!
Ceremony's off, mein Fhrer!
It's a chunk of ice, you drama queen!
Okay... all I said was--
I don't care what you
said. We have to fix this!
Or do you want to tell Bree
that you torpedoed her ceremony?
I did not tell you to put
mums in that arrangement!
And don't point your finger at
me or I'll snap it right off.
I'll find Bob.
I'll get Lee.
You can't make me talk to him.
Yeah, I can. Sit down.
Earlier, my husband, in an attempt
to help you with your relationship,
mistakenly gave you some advice, which
he would now like to take back. Tom?
Actually, I stand by everything I said.
My mistake was in not going far enough.
What?
If you're willing to break
up over an ice sculpture,
you guys should
absolutely not get married.
Where the hell are you going with this?
Because who gets to choose the ice
sculpture, who should take out the trash,
who has to stay home and
make the mini pizzas--
that's the little stuff.
What are you gonna do when
the big stuff comes along?
Could you give us a second?
No.
What are you gonna do when
a tornado hits your house,
or you have problems with your kids,
or one of you gets cancer?
At some point, the crap is going
to hit the fan, and that is why now,
before you make the commitment,
you have to ask yourself,
is that person in bed next
to you worth the trble?
Do you love him... or her so much that
no disease, no disaster
could possibly pull you apart?
Answer him.
Sure.
Of course I do.
Good. Good, then...
get out there and get
committed, you crazy kids.
Oh my God. Are you okay?
You need some help?
Yes.
Thanks for stopping.
Yes, officer. I see you.
Thank you for coming.
Now remember, Ellie's dangerous.
So if she shows up, feel
free to use excessive force.
Carlos, are you almost ready?
Carlos? Did you hear me?
I'm just getting my jacket.
Oh, honey, can you carry the house
keys? They don't fit in my purse.
Ellie's upstairs.
What?
She's in our bedroom. I heard
her breathing. Call the cops.
Wait! She's gonna steal our money!
You can't go up there.
It's too dangerous.
Well, not as dangerous as poverty!
Gaby.
Gaby? What's going on?
Carlos! Carlos, don't just stand there!
Go get help!
Help! Police!
That's the closet!
Police! Police! Get in here now!
Wayne.
I don't think you've
thought this through.
Shut up.
If I tell you what happened,
if I don't tell you...
you're gonna kill me anyway.
Who you gonna pin it on?
We have history.
Right now I'm just
your bitter, crazy ex.
But if I turn up dead,
and you have no alibi--
you let me worry about that.
Look, I'm having a
little problem right now.
I just need to hide here for a sec.
And I don't wanna hurt
you, so don't make me.
All right?
Good. I'm glad we understand each other.
And with your gun, too.
I guess I just found my alibi.
And now we will do the
exchanging of the rings...
Snappy ceremony, Bree.
You and Katherine
really did a bang-up job.
No, I did a bang-up job.
Katherine bailed on me
and left town last night.
I think you got hosed.
I just saw her an hour ago.
...at this joyous and festive occasion.
Please join hands.
She was on the run, she broke in,
she stabbed you, you shot her.
Case closed.
It's like the alibi fairy
left me a present.
But I do wonder...
what if Dylan doesn't come back?
We had a fight.
She said she hated me,
said she was leaving...
for good.
Is that the best you can do, Kathy?
I know it sounds convenient.
But what happens if it's true?
Because you don't have another plan.
Was the only way you couldmake
me tell you the truth.
Katherine? It's Bree.
We need to talk now!
That girl that was
living with the Solises?
Actually, I thought I saw
her heading down that way.
Hope you find her.
I'd hate to think there was some maniac
running around our neighborhood.
I'm so sorry about this.
Shut it!
So let me catch you up.
I need to know something that only my ex-wife
can tell me, but she doesn't want to.
She needs a little incentive.
So that's where you come in.
Wayne...
please don't.
Yeah? How is it gonna feel knowing...
that you could've stopped this?
All right!
I'll tell you.
After I left you...
a few months passed,
and I convinced myself
that you'd forgotten about us.
But I was wrong.
How was Dylan? Did she behave herself?
She's an angel.
I... just hope I didn't
do something wrong.
What do you mean?
Well, your ex-husband was
here earlier, and, of course,
I didn't know it was him
until Dylan called him "Daddy."
I-I'm sorry, I should've called you,
but Dylan was just so happy to see him.
He bught her a bicycle and a doll.
And won't let that doll out of her sight.
Katherine, what's going on?
I was going to run again,
but you didn't give me enough time.
Wayne just drove up.
Should we call the police?
No. Let him in.
I knew it was time to faceou and let
you know you were not welcome in my home,
and neither were your gifts.
Do you know how much money
I spent looking for you?
Well, I'm sure you still had enough
to buy liquor by the caseload.
Look who's gotten sassy
while she's been away.
Well, I think I like it.
What do you want, Wayne?
I want my daughter back.
Why? You gotten lazy in your old age?
You need somebody smaller to pound on?
I never touched a hair on her head!
Yeah, but now she's gotten
older and sassier,
I'm sure you'll find all
sorts of reasons to hit her.
I don't have to ask, you know.
I could just go up there if I want.
She is asleep!
Get the hell out!
I'm her father!
I said no!
I'm bleeding.
Profusely.
You should see a doctor.
I'll be back for my daughter.
You just
understand this--
there is nothing that I will not do
to keep you away from her. Nothing.
Are you all right? I heard a crash.
Yeah, I-I hit him with
the candlestick, and...
he went down pretty hard.
Thank God.
You know, I think now would be a good time to
break out the 10-year-old scotch I've been saving.
I honestly thought it was finally over.
I don't know how I could've been so wrong.
Katherine!
I came in to give her another blanket.
Her hand is ice-cold!
Aunt Lily told me I
couldn't go to the police.
She'd said you'd make it seem like I
killed Dylan to keep you from taking her,
so I let her bury my baby in the woods.
I knew I'd have to run away again, but I
also knew you'd never stop looking for me,
so I came up with a plan.
I found a girl in a Romanian orphanage
who looked just like Dylan.
The resemblance was uncanny.
Her mother had died in childbirth,
and her father had been murdered.
As I looked into those big,
blue eyes, I knew right then...
she needed me as much as I needed her.
I've never told that to anyone.
I even lied to Adam and
said it was your fault.
And that's how I've
spent the last 12 years...
just telling one lie after another.
Hold it, hold it.
I'm sorry, sir.
We're having a party.
You can't park here.
So you let her die.
If you don't mind, I need you
to park around the corner, okay?
Thank you.
You let my daughter die...
like a dog.
It was an accident.
Then you buried her like one.
Because I had to.
I knew if you
found out, you--
that I would kill you.
Katherine! Where are you?
Adam! Get out! He's got a gun!
You just watch over him for a sec,
okay? I'm gonna call the cops.
First we have to do something
to stop that bleeding.
Go ahead. You call the cops.
Ask for my buddy Romslo...
or Captain McMurphy.
We play softball together.
Those guys'll take care of me.
And even if I do a little time...
you know this isn't over.
I'll get out, and I'll find you,
and I'll make you pay.
I know you will.
Oh my God! Bree, are you all right?
What the hell is going on?
We don't have much time before
the police get here. Please talk.
Excuse me. Susan!
Come here, come here.
What's going on?
Okay, just listen to me.
Ma'am, you have to talk to us.
We need to know what happened. Ma'am?
Then he raised the
gun and came toward us.
Thank God, Katherine grabbed
his arm and got the gun away.
That lunatic would've killed us all.
I knew Wayne was the reason she moved
away, and the second she moved back,
he started stalking her again.
She was always telling
us how terrified she was.
We always knew he'd do something
like this eventually, and he did.
Look...
this was obviously self-defense.
Take the cuffs off,
get her to the hospital.
Mom? Mom! Oh, my!
I'm so sorry, Mom.
"Five Years Later"
There's a ritual my friends
have observed for years.
Once a week, they meet to play a game
of cards and talk about their lives.
Of course, there's another
aspect to these gatherings
that has nothing to do
with gossip or poker.
Every seven days, my friends are
reminded of a basic human truth:
There is nothing more important
than friendships that endure,
especially in a world
that insists on changing.
Okay, my friends are gone.
I'm ready to fix you dinner.
What the hell are you doing?
Hey, Mommy, we're playing fashion model!
Look at this mess!
You are lucky I got in here
before you touched my dresses!
Run, Celia, run!
My Vera Wang?
I'm home!
Oh, thank God.
The publisher sent over
the galley for the cookbook.
He needs you to proof them tonight.
I've also got the woman from
the New York Times on the phone.
She wants to do the interview now.
Is that you, Bree?
The water's getting cold.
Uh, leave the galleys in my office and tell the
woman from the Times to call me back in the morning.
I'm gonna have a nice
bubble bath with my husband.
Coming, Orson!
Why is there a police
car in our driveway?
I was telling your husband
we just picked up your son.
He broke into a car at the
mall and took it for a joyride.
Again?
I am so sorry, officer.
We have talked to Porter
till we're blue in the face.
It's like he's determined
to go back to juvenile halL.
Honey, it wasn't Porter this time.
They arrested Preston.
It's me, Mom. I'm back from Paris.
It was just as gorgeous as you said it
would be, and you're not gonna believe this.
Bradley finally asked me to marry him
right there under the Eiffel tower.
I'm so happy. Call me back.
Honey? I'm home.
Did you miss me?
You know I did.
