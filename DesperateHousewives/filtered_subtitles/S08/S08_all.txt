Previously on...
I wanna get things right this time.
Bree's relationship
with detective Vance got serious.
What are we gonna say to people?
Tom and Lynette decided to separate.
We shouldn't tell anyone
until we tell the kids.
Oh, god. The kids.
Sit down. Ow!
Gaby's stepfather returned
to terrorize her again...
I remember those nights in your room, baby.
No! Stop.
Until Carlos stopped him...
permanently.
Gaby?
What happened?
I killed him.
And now he's gonna go to jail
because he was trying to protect me.
Calm down. We just need time to think.
We don't have time.
Yes, there was the dinner party.
Everybody's coming.
Including your boyfriend the detective.
I killed the son of a bitch
who hurt my wife.
If I have to go to prison, I will.
That's not gonna happen.
Every hostess knows
there's work to be done after
the guests leave a party.
And only the best of friends
will stay long after the party's over...
to help clean up the mess.
They help with the heavy lifting...
they work together to lighten the load.
They take on the most unpleasant tasks.
And, of course,
there's no task more unpleasant
than getting rid of an unwanted guest.
I should go move the car off the trail.
You gonna be okay?
Is this happening?
Are we really doing this?
Everyone stay focused.
The hardest part is over.
Now all we have to do is fill this in.
Oh, my god.
I thought I got everything.
No.
No, you missed the phone.
And if you missed that,
what else did you miss?
Susan, it's gonna be okay.
How is it going to be okay?
Someone is calling the dead guy.
"Home."
See?
He has a home... with
people who care about him,
people who are going to
come looking for him,
leading them straight to us.
What do you want us to do?
It's not too late. We...
we could still go to the police.
And send my husband back to prison?
This time for murder?
No, not necessarily. It was self-defense.
He broke into your house.
He threatened you. We could explain that.
Yeah, then we can explain how
we dumped him in a trunk,
ate some cheesecake,
and buried him in the woods!
We are going to get caught.
People always get caught.
We can't do this. We're not criminals.
We drive carpool.
That's enough.
This is a very bad man.
He attacked our friend,
and her husband protected her,
and now we are gonna protect them.
That means we tell no one.
Not the police...
not our families.
No one.
When we bury the body,
we bury the secret forever.
Susan?
Yes, it's only the best of friends
who stay long after the party's over
to help clean up the mess...
Even when that mess may be bigger
than they bargained for.
It has been said that change
doesn't happen overnight,
but over the course of month,
it's amazing how much the ground
can shift beneath us.
A woman who helped conceal a crime
is now sleeping with a detective.
A man who used to look forward to bedtime...
is now finding himself dreading it.
A woman who once told her husband everything
is now keeping a terrible secret.
And a couple who have decided to separate
is now going to great lengths to show
that nothing has changed.
Crap! Crap! Crap! Crap!
Aah! Son of a...
Hey, hey, hey, guys!
Got up early, so I figured, what the heck?
I'll go get your mom some coffee...
the good stuff.
She deserves it.
She needs it, too.
I didn't sleep last night.
But you would know that. You were there.
Do not drink this.
It's been in my car for three days.
Where are your shoes, dad?
It's casual friday.
Casual thursday.
Come on. We're gonna miss the bus.
See ya later. I'll see ya at dinner.
Love you.
God, I practically lost a toe out there.
It wouldn't have happened
if you hadn't overslept.
Yeah, well, you know,
you took the good alarm clock
along with the good pillow and the house.
This is ridiculous. We have to
tell the kids we've separated.
We will, but this weekend
is Gaby's big barbecue,
and I don't wanna ruin it for them.
Yeah, and last weekend,
you didn't wanna ruin
the basketball tournament.
The weekend before that,
Penny's birthday. Come on, Lynette.
Are you sure this is about the kids?
What else would it be?
No, Tom, nothing's changed.
We still need time away from each other.
Yeah, I agree. We got a lot
of problems to work out,
so why can't we tell the kids?
I just think they deserve
one more happy weekend
before we tear this family apart.
You know what? You're...
Paige is up.
Mmm.
Mmm. Mmm.
Don't take this the wrong way,
but you could do this professionally.
Coming from a man
who's on a first-name basis
with half the hookers in Fairview,
that's quite a compliment, detective.
Hey, I was thinking maybe this weekend,
we could head up to that
place in the mountains,
just the two of us.
Oh, that sounds lovely,
but Gaby is having her
annual barbecue on saturday.
Am I invited?
Of course you are. Why wouldn't you be?
Oh, I don't know. Maybe because
your friends don't like me.
What? You are imagining things.
It's true.
They don't talk to me.
They don't make eye contact.
It's been that way for weeks,
ever since the night of the dinner party.
Why...
Uh, why would you say that?
Bree, I'm a cop.
I got an eye for human behavior.
That was when everything changed.
I just can't figure out why.
I keep going over that night, hour by hour.
Well, stop... going over that night,
because everything is fine.
The girls are just as
crazy about you as I am.
I don't know. I'm not feeling it.
Well...
Are you feeling this?
Bree, I know what's going on.
You're trying to distract me with sex,
and if that's the case...
Mmm.
Bring it on.
Wake up! I made you waffles.
Come back when you learn
how to make mimosas.
Come on! I left Celia alone with them.
There won't be any left.
Damn it, Juanita! That's enough!
Get outta here now!
Carlos!
Juanita, honey, I'm sorry!
Why have you been so short-tempered lately?
Gosh, I don't know.
Maybe I'm upset about
my golf swing or the economy...
or maybe it's because I killed a guy.
Look, I get it, okay?
But we have to move on with our lives.
Don't you think I want to?
I just can't stop thinking about this.
No matter what I do,
it's this horrible thing
that is always there.
I need to talk to someone.
I know a guy named Tom Collins.
He's a great listener.
I meant father Dugan.
Okay, are you crazy? You can't tell anyone.
That's too risky.
A priest can't share
what you say in confession.
Are you sure he's not just
gonna make you feel guiltier?
I mean, that's their thing.
Fine. We'll go see the priest.
I have to.
I'm turning into a terrible husband, father.
I need to get this off my conscience.
It's tearing me apart.
Susan.
What are you doing?
Oh. I was looking out the window,
and I noticed dust in the
corner of each windowpane.
It's been driving me nuts.
Okay.
What's going on with you?
What do you mean?
Well, there's a lot of weird stuff
you like to do in the bedroom,
but cleaning... not so much.
Couldn't sleep.
Yeah, that's been happening a lot lately.
You don't sleep. You don't eat.
You never leave the house.
That's not true.
I'm substitute teaching today.
And that's great, but...
Did you have a fight with the girls?
What?
Why would you say that?
Well, a month ago,
you were so excited
to move back to the lane,
and now you never see 'em.
There's... no coffee, no poker,
no... bitching about husbands
over coffee and poker.
The girls and I are fine.
Then what is it?
Come on, Susan. It's me.
You can tell me anything.
I'm going for a run.
Susan.
Well, you said I should
get out of the house more.
Hey.
So what do we know
about the new guy?
Definitely rich. Check out the car.
Definitely single. Check out the fish.
Rich and single...
I wonder what he looks like.
You rarely get the trifecta.
What's your guess?
Wonky eye? Rabbit teeth? Comb-over?
One normal eyebrow, one really big one?
Baby hands?
I had it all on one guy. Did not end well.
Well, I actually saw our
new neighbor this morning.
Hmm. 6'1". 190.
He was wearing this
great-looking pair of jeans.
And let me just say,
I can tell you one thing that isn't wonky.
Gaby.
Oh, come on. I'm married. I'm not dead.
Can still imagine all
the dirty things I'd do to him.
Like what?
Oh, god!
Oh! I didn't know you were...
I'm Susan Delfino.
Ah.
Nice to meet you.
Ben Faulkner.
Hi.
Well, I'm actually 6'2",
and I haven't been 190
since I played rugby,
but, uh, thank you.
Uh, and as for the jeans,
you know, I could never figure out
why they would cost 200 bucks. Now I know.
Ladies, excuse me.
Oh. Okay.
Thanks.
Welcome.
Dibs.
Look who's out.
Hey, Susan!
Uh, would you like
to join us for coffee?!
Uh, sorry. I can't talk.
I'm subbing today! Can't be late!
Is anyone talking to her?
I tried. She's not returning my calls.
Same here. She's obviously avoiding us.
I'm telling you, that is one loose cannon.
Well, we have got
to get her back in the fold.
This is too risky.
Says the woman
who's dating a cop.
Did it ever occur to you that
it might be good to keep him close?
If there's ever an investigation,
I will be the first to know.
I'm doing this for us.
He's that good in the sack?
You have no idea.
And when you finish your
worksheets on ladybugs,
we will go outside and
see if we can find some.
Susan, how's it going?
Good.
It's nice to be back.
To be honest,
I've been feeling a little down lately.
This is just what I needed.
Mrs. Delfino?
Cupcake's not moving.
She's probably sleeping, honey.
No, I poked her with
my pencil a couple times.
She is d-e-a dead.
Uh... it's okay, kids. I know what to do.
Oh, my god. What do I do?
There's a little spot in the garden
where we bury the class pets.
Bury?
Yeah.
Have a little funeral. Say a few words.
Just don't mention god.
Amanda's parents are atheists,
lawyers, and major douches.
Bless me, father, for I have sinned.
It's been a while since my last confession.
Continue, my son.
"My son." I'm sorry.
It's just you're, like,
a thousand years older than me.
Who are you and where's father Dugan?
Leaving on sabbatical.
Fun for him and fun for me.
This is my first week of confessions.
It is?
Yeah, and, man, the things I've heard.
There was a lady yesterday who...
No, no, no, I can't say it.
I think I'll come back.
Unh-unh. No. You're not going anywhere.
I told you to wait in the car.
Don't snap at me. That's why we're here.
You keep saying you wanna talk to someone,
so talk to this guy.
He seems perfectly... enthusiastic.
He's 12 years old.
This will blow his collar off.
Oh, man, this must be awesome.
I'm so bummed I can't tweet anymore.
Sorry. If it's not father Dugan,
I'm not doing this.
No... let's go.
Nuts.
I was really hoping
this would be a good one.
I made out with two chicks once in college.
This job rocks!
Uh...
I don't know if you've ever
buried anything before,
but you have to dig a hole.
Right. Of course.
I knew that.
It's funny the way life works
out sometimes, isn't it?
I mean, I wasn't even
supposed to be here today.
Once again, in the wrong
place at the wrong time.
Now I have to carry this around with me
for the rest of my life.
Don't be sad, Mrs. Delfino.
Cupcake was kind of a bad hamster.
She had three babies and ate them.
But does that mean she deserved to die?
We don't get to make that call, Juanita.
We're not god.
That's right, Amanda. I said it.
What have I done?
It's not your fault.
I know it's not my fault,
but try telling that to Cupcake's family
when they show up looking for her.
There.
We're done.
Now let's all slap on a happy face
and pretend like this never happened.
Can I come in?
I'm really not feeling
like drinking right now.
Great. Mmm.
So... were you two close?
Pardon?
You and Cupcake.
Juanita told me what happened.
I assume you two had a long history,
went to college together,
backpacked through Europe.
It just sort of hit me in a weird way.
I'm worried about you.
First, you stop talking to your friends.
Now you're wigging out at a rat funeral.
You're making me nervous.
Well, I'm sorry I'm not
handling accessory to murder
as well as the rest of you.
Susan, I'm begging you.
This is my husband's
life we're talking about.
If anything were to happen to him,
think of what would
happen to me and my girls.
I know you're having a hard time,
but please hold it together.
I'm trying.
Try harder.
Bree?
Do I smell...
Yes, white chocolate macadamia nut...
your favorite.
Oh!
Now you're my favorite. Mwah.
Hmm.
How was your day?
Terrific. I found a dead body.
Oh, I'm-I'm sorry.
You don't wanna hear about this.
No, I do. Your work is fascinating.
So, um, where exactly
did you find this body?
Warehouse out by the docks.
So now I'm a big hero
because I cracked a case
those poor bastards in New haven P.D.
have been working on for months.
Oh, good for you.
Mm. I got lucky.
All I did was spot a sedan
with Connecticut plates,
and I asked myself, "Who owns that car?"
The dead man had a car.
Exactly. The killers did everything right,
but they forgot to get
rid of the victim's ride.
What idiots.
Mm-hmm.
So you kept his keys,
but it never occurred
to you he might have a car.
I just threw all his stuff in our safe.
I didn't spend a lot of
time thinking about it.
There it is.
Drop it off in a bad part of town,
and let social decay... take its course.
Oh, god, do you have to tidy up?
Get in. If anybody catches
us in this car, we're dead.
Oh, no, it's a stick.
I can't drive a stick. Can you?
I did once in high school.
It's easy. Just one extra pedal.
Oh.
It was easier when I was drunk.
What should I do? Should I gun it?
Gun it? You can't even drive it.
I thought that was you.
Chuck. Look, Gaby, it's Chuck.
Mm.
I-I saw you were struggling.
Whose car is this?
My aunt's.
My friend's.
Her aunt and my friend.
Aunt Shirley.
She, uh, came over to my place
last night for book club, and...
She had too much to drink.
Classic Shirley.
So we told her we'd bring
her car back today.
In fact, she's waiting for us,
so we should scoot.
Yeah.
No way.
I'll drive.
What?
The way you guys are going,
you're gonna kill someone.
Go, Bob. I'll meet you back at the station.
Oh, no, Bob, Bob, don't go! Bob? Oh.
Well...
Okay, a road trip in this neat old car
with your cop boyfriend. Fun.
So where does Shirley live?
Yeah, Bree, where does she live?
Why are you asking me? She's your aunt.
Just keep driving.
I'll tell you when to turn.
Huh. That's interesting.
No, it's not.
I mean... what is?
Oklahoma city redhawks.
Is your aunt a fan?
Oh, yeah, Shirley loves that... uh... sport.
And... men's cologne?
She's a lesbian.
Yeah. She could've been married,
but, no, she's a lesbian.
So, this, um, aunt or... friend,
who's a men's cologne-wearing lesbian...
she also likes to chew tobacco?
'Cause I never met a woman
who likes to chew...
ever.
I chew tobacco.
And I'm a woman.
Yeah.
Mmm.
All that's missing is a glass of chardonnay.
I keep telling her to quit.
"Do you want mouth cancer?" I say,
but she won't listen.
You okay?
Yeah. Ugh!
No. Pull over. Now.
Sorry! Shirley likes plain.
I prefer chocolate.
Oh!
Get out.
What?
I'm taking your car.
Oh, my god. I could kiss you!
What? What are you... Just get out!
Shh! Keep your voice down.
That man over there is a cop.
A cop?
No! Get back in here.
When you start something,
young man, you see it through.
Buckle up!
Hey, what happened?
Shirley. Just happened to be walking by.
Isn't that a stroke of luck?
So do you think your friend
Bob could give us a ride home?
Sure. I'll... I'll call him.
So how's that dating a cop
while covering up a murder
working out for you?
Hey, Renee. Ladies.
Don't distract them.
They have an important job to do.
I'm gonna go see the new neighbor.
You know, give him a ride
on the ol' welcome wagon.
Wow, that was fast.
I didn't know you two had even talked.
We haven't.
So what makes you think
he's gonna be interested?
Hear that, ladies? Watch and learn.
I will show you some of my secrets.
Hi. I'm gonna save us some time.
Look, I'm single. You're single.
I'm hot. You're hot.
Assuming you're not gay,
and those shoes tell me you're not,
we could do that thing where
we flirt for a few weeks.
You can stare at my ass getting the mail,
and I do get my mail four times a day.
Or you... could invite me in
for... coffee...
Right now.
Thanks for the offer, but, uh, I'm good.
Um, when I said "coffee,"
you did know I meant sex, right?
Oh, you were subtle, but,
uh, yeah. I got it.
Wow. You should write a book.
Otherwise, when you die,
your secrets will die with you.
Father Dugan!
I'm so glad I caught you.
I don't know if you remember me.
Gabrielle Solis.
I assume you've come to apologize
for taking a phone call
during my easter sermon?
Oh! I'm sorry, father. But, you know,
if you don't confirm those spa
appointments, you lose 'em.
Yeah.
Um, anyway, I came here about Carlos.
He's in trouble, and he needs your help.
Well, I'd love to help Carlos.
He's a good man.
But I'm afraid you're too late.
What? You were the one who
kept blabbing in that sermon
how it's never too late
to confess your sins.
See? I can listen and take calls.
It's true. God waits
until the heart is ready.
But the airlines are a little stricter,
and I'm not going overseas in a middle seat.
So if you'll excuse me.
You getting on, too, miss?
Uh, yes, but I couldn't... manage my bag.
Be a dear and grab it for me?
Hey.
What are you doing?
Taking you to the airport...
with one quick detour.
Hey! Hey, hey, hey! Stop it! Stop it!
Are you crazy? I can't miss my plane.
Well, I'm sorry if I'm trying
to get you to do god's work
instead of going on your
dream vacation to...
Rwanda, where I'll be
digging wells... for lepers.
Well, your little friends
are gonna have to wait.
Excuse me.
Whoa.
Well, where did you u me from?
We're headed off on our honeymoon.
And we can't have any detours.
They say you have to get to
the airport three hours early
for international flights.
Oh, honey, relax. Since we caught Bin Laden,
you can stroll on
the plane anytime you want.
It's just, I've done something, father,
And I'm afraid that it's...
unforgivable.
God can forgive us for anything.
Really? Anything?
Yes.
If we're willing to show
that we are truly repentant.
How?
Well, it's not by what we say.
It's by what we do.
For instance, if we were
talking about a crime...
then confessing to the authorities
would prove the intentions of our heart.
That...
is not an option.
There are other people involved...
innocent people.
You can't ask to be absolved
for a sin that you intend to keep hidden.
You should go.
You're gonna miss your flight.
I don't wanna leave you, Carlos,
not till I'm sure that you're gonna be okay.
Father Dugan, I don't see any way
that I am ever going to be okay.
Hey.
Hey.
I wish I could make you
stop thinking about this.
Yeah, me, too.
I don't even know what I was looking for.
There is no absolution for this thing.
I just have to live with it.
Every noise I'd hear at night, it was him.
Every dark alley I passed,
he was waiting for me.
When I'd lie in bed,
I was afraid he'd come find me.
He was in my dreams... and in my nightmares.
I couldn't escape him.
And that's what I had to live with...
until now.
For the first time, I'm not scared.
You did that for me.
Yeah...
by taking a man's life.
Yes, you may have taken a life,
but you also saved one.
So if it's absolution you're looking for...
I give it to you.
Hey.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Hey, is everything okay with the kids?
Yeah, yeah, the...
the kids are fine. I just...
What? Did something happen?
I really... need you right now.
Okay.
Morning.
Morning.
Oh, my god. Oh, my god.
Crap, crap, crap.
Come on. Come on.
Okay.
Watch out for the, uh...
Okay, okay, o...
Honey. Ooh.
No, I'm okay. Okay, go.
Shh, shh, shh, shh.
They're still asleep.
Thank god.
I'll start the coffee.
Okay, you read my mind.
Hey.
Yeah?
So last night...
Yeah.
We should talk about it.
Uh-huh.
I mean...
If you wanna get back together...
I'm open to that.
But we have some serious problems
that are gonna require serious work.
Oh, god.
Last night...
uh...
was...
not about getting back together.
Then what the hell was it about?
I...
I had a nightmare.
Well... a-a nightmare? Are you kidding me?
You've gotta understand.
I'm having a lot of nightmares.
This is such a scary time,
and I really need you.
That's-that's why I didn't
want to tell the kids.
Having you across
the street makes me feel safe.
You're unbelievable.
You know what you do when
you're scared, Lynette?
You buy a night-light.
You don't go have sex with the guy
you are supposed to be separated from!
I want french toast.
I hate french toast. I want pancakes.
Oh.
Kids...
there's something your mom
and I need to tell you.
Yeah.
Why don't we sit down?
Hey, I, uh, I know it's a barbecue,
but isn't that a little casual?
Yeah, um,
I don't think I'm gonna go this year.
Why don't you go without me?
Hey, do I need to be worried?
I told you. I'm fine.
I don't mean worried about you.
I mean worried about us.
I thought this was some problem
between you and your friends, but...
the way you've been shutting me out,
I'm starting to think you've
got a problem with me.
How could you say that?
No matter what I'm going through,
I would never let anything come between us.
Yeah, I'm sure Tom and
Lynette felt the same way.
Look where they ended up.
Well, I'm headed over there without you.
No. I'm going with you.
You're right.
I do have a problem with the girls.
It's about time I went over
there and straightened it out.
No! No way. You are not
bringing Mike in on this.
He's not gonna tell anyone.
We can trust him.
Oh, just like I could trust you
when we agreed to keep this between us?
Susan, we all empathize with your position,
but I don't think it's smart to tell Mike.
Well, he knows something is up.
It's affecting our marriage.
You know what's gonna affect my marriage?
when my husband goes to prison.
I think we should let her tell him.
I can't believe this.
We all made a pact that night.
I don't remember anybody bringing up
These extra conditions.
Well, you weren't exactly asking
anyone's opinion that night,
were you, Bree?
What is that supposed to mean?
It means you elected yourself chairman
of the... dead guy committee
and started making decisions for everyone.
Like you always do.
Well, somebody had to, Susan,
And it sure as hell wasn't gonna be you.
I'm done talking about this.
The only reason I came to this barbecue
was to let you know that I am telling Mike.
The hell you are.
Aah!
Oh, my god!
Gaby! Gaby!
Trade Manning?
What, are you out of your mind?
Think for a minute. When is his
stock ever gonna be higher?
Let me go!
You could get a great player.
Yeah, maybe a great quarterback,
like, I don't know. Manning?
Ow!
Get off me!
Girls, people can hear us!
Ow! I told you we couldn't trust her!
I can't see.
Lynette! Aah!
Oh! I got it!
What the hell's going on?
Uh, well...
I... lost my earring,
and the girls here were
kind enough to help me look for it.
Oh! There it is!
I went food shopping yesterday.
I kept having to put things back.
I'd take a couple of cans of peaches.
And then I'd remember that Tom
was the only one who liked them,
put them back.
Sweet pickles... Tom.
Put them back.
I am so sorry.
With everything that's been going on,
I haven't been there for you.
I guess we've all been guilty of that.
I'm sorry, Susan.
This is so damn hard.
You know, the good thing
about Mike and Tom not knowing
is they can't be implicated.
If something were to happen,
at least they'd be okay.
We are never gonna be able to
tell anybody about this, are we?
No.
Are you gonna be able to live with that?
I'm gonna try.
It's only the best of friends
who stay long after the party's over
to help clean up...
To cleanse the pain of
a guilty conscience...
to pick up the pieces...
of a broken marriage...
To sweep away the loneliness
of keeping a secret.
Yes...
It's good to have friends who
help clean up our messes.
But every housewife knows
that as soon as one mess is taken care of...
another one appears.
And we may find ourselves...
right back where we started.

Ladies.
Renee was charmed by the new neighbor.
Dibs.
Trying to protect Gaby,
Carlos committed murder.
We are never gonna be able
to tell anybody about this.
Are you gonna be able to live with that?
And the women swore to keep the secret.
But then Bree received a warning.
When I was alive,
Bree Van De Kamp was one
of my closest friends.
Maybe that's because we
had so much in common.
Like Bree, I also received
a menacing letter...
One that threatened to
shatter the perfect life
I had worked so hard to create.
You see, I had once committed
a desperate act of my own.
And despite my best
efforts to conceal it,
someone found out and
was determined to expose me.
I thought about telling my friends.
But I decided not to burden them.
I had hoped that with one final act,
I could consign my deeds to history.
But I had forgotten that history...
has a way of repeating itself.
Something interesting?
No. No, just a... letter...
from a friend who I haven't,
uh, heard from in a while.
You okay?
I'm fine.
I'm just annoyed
because the, uh, postman left me
Gaby's water bill again.
You go in. I'll just
put it back in the box.
All right.
Oh, Karen.
You scared me. What are
you doing out so late?
What am I, a cat?
I'm allowed to be out past 10:00.
I'm sorry. Have you seen
anyone near my mailbox?
What's the problem?
I just... got a letter.
An obscene letter.
That's all?
You oughta be happy that someone
still finds you obscene.
Last week, I got called
"Sir" three times.
Karen! This is serious.
I need to find out who put
this letter in my mailbox.
Wow, you're really shaken up.
Yes, I am.
This is very upsetting,
and I don't know what I'm going to do.
It's just a note, Bree. Let it go.
Yes, Bree Van De Kamp and
I had so much in common.
We shared similar lives.
And now Bree found herself praying
that we wouldn't share a similar fate.
In the divided world of the suburbs,
everyone is looking
for a way to connect.
They fend off loneliness
with casual conversation.
They share old treasures
with a young friend.
They help a neighbor
make a difficult move.
But for Carlos and Gaby Solis,
the only connection that mattered
was the romantic one.
And when it came to maintaining it,
Gaby was willing to
pull out all the stops.
What are we celebrating?
A new record. It's been
38 days since we last had sex,
and that streak is ending tonight.
Seriously, it's been that long?
38 days.
That's like three years in hoo-hah time.
Sweetie, I would love to,
but I have way too much work to do.
Unh-unh. No, no. No excuses.
I changed the sheets, shaved my legs,
and dumped the kids at McCluskey's,
so drop your pants,
cowboy, and saddle up.
Yes, ma'am.
Oh!
Don't feel bad.
It happens to lots of men.
Not to me. Not to us.
Well, it has been 38 days.
Maybe the poor little
guy forgot what to do.
Not helping.
Oh.
Listen, you've been under
a lot of stress lately.
So relax.
How about I give you a nice massage,
we finish the champagne,
and later we try again?
Gaby, thanks, but it's
not gonna work, okay?
Like Carlos, Susan Delfino was
also feeling disconnected.
Her guilt made the world
a strange and scary place...
where she could be
exposed at any moment.
Hey! Hold it right there!
I know what you did.
What?
Yeah, and you're not
getting away with it.
You thought you could walk
out with a case of soda
and no one would notice?
Oh. Uh...
I-I forgot those were down there.
Yeah. Right. I've never
heard that one before.
Ma'am, I'm gonna ask you
to step away from the cart
and keep your hands where I can see 'em.
Everything okay here?
If you consider larceny okay.
Mrs. Delfino,
on behalf of Fairview market,
I'd like to apologize for Kevin.
Seems we're all paying the price
for his rejection from
the police academy.
Oh, well, excuse me for not
wanting to live in a world
where people can commit crimes
without suffering the consequences.
You are a criminal.
I've known Mrs. Delfino for years.
She pays for the grapes
she eats in the produce section.
She would never do anything bad.
Sure, I would.
What?
You don't know me at all.
I'm a very bad person.
I did a horrible thing.
I deserve to be punished.
Let me cuff her. I have cuffs.
I brought 'em from home.
No one's getting cuffed.
Just... pay for the soda
next time you come in.
No, no, no. No,
you need to march me inside
and make me pay now.
Mrs. Delfino...
I'm serious.
Make an example of me
to deter other criminals.
Fine. Take her in.
Copy that.
Yep. Did the crime. Doing the time.
Dead man walking.
So what's the damage?
An arm and a leg? Just an arm?
Not even a finger.
It's a cracked fitting.
I swapped it out. It's no charge.
Really? The first guy I called
said I had to re-pipe the whole house.
Oh, it's a scam.
These pipes are top-of-the-line copper.
The guy that put 'em in did a great job.
How do you know? It was me.
You just saved me 10 grand.
No wonder people say such
good things about you.
Well...
What are neighbors for?
Need anything else, just holler.
Actually, there is one thing.
I'm a real estate developer,
about to break ground on a new project,
and, uh, I'm looking for some help...
local guys that I can trust.
You interested?
Hey, Mike. Got a minute?
Um... Hey, Renee.
We're friends, right?
Well...
Oh, come on. You fixed
my toilet for free.
Um, that wasn't free. I sent you a bill.
You just haven't paid it.
Ahh. Anyway, look, here's the deal.
Uh, Ben likes me.
He just doesn't know it yet.
Now I need to find that
thing that we connect on.
You've been on the inside.
What can you tell me about him?
Well, he's got copper pipes.
Something personal.
I saw a box of cheerios...
and a coffeemaker.
He must like coffee.
Unless it's for guests.
Oh, my god. I got more
out of the cable guy,
and he's deaf.
Does he have any photos?
Artwork? Think, Delfino, think!
Okay.
Okay. Um...
There was this plaque from the mayor...
Something about his
work with the elderly.
Really?
He likes the elderly?
Well, I like the elderly.
Since when?
Oh. Old people are adorable.
I love their little raisin faces
and those tennis balls
they put on their walkers.
Thanks for the tip...
Friend.
Mom!
Hey, how was your day?
Awesome. Dad's hotel is so cool.
We went swimming in
the pool and played marco polo
and cannonballed off the diving board.
Why don't we have a pool?
And then we got hamburgers
and french fries
and super-sized cherry cola slushies.
Ah. Sugar and caffeine.
I guess you figured
they were too young for meth?
It's just a slushie.
On a school night.
She's gonna be up till 2:00 A.M.
Just 'cause you couldn't say "No."
You're blowing this out of proportion.
Who wants to play mega monopoly?
It's just like regular
monopoly but with more stuff.
You just keep playing and playing
and playing and playing and playing...
Yeah. Way out of proportion.
Look, now that we're really separated,
I refuse to be the bad guy all the time.
You have got to learn to say "No."
I say it.
Tonight when we walked
past the pet shop,
they wanted a spider monkey.
I said "No."
I'm serious. Things are different now.
I'm not gonna let this
be the house of pain
while you're living it up
at the MTV beach house.
You're right.
Things are different now.
For instance, I used to have to
stand here and listen to this.
But now I'm thinking... no.
Hey, look at that. I'm getting
pretty good at this "No" thing.
It's bad enough when we weren't
even trying to have sex,
but to try and fail?
Well, do you think it
might have something to do
with the stress Carlos is under?
We're all under stress.
You know what's stressful?
Is not having sex for 39 1/2 days.
You're sounding a little callous.
I don't mean to. It's just,
sex is important to us.
Even in our toughest times,
it's what always held us together.
If we don't have that,
I'm worried what will happen to us.
I get that.
So... come on, girls.
How can I spice things
up in the bedroom?
Is this actually happening?
Gabrielle Solis is
asking us for sex tips?
I know! It's the apocalypse.
Well, if you don't mind harsh lighting
and blatant misogyny,
you can always watch a porno.
Watched one. Filmed one. Next.
This may shock you,
but sometimes Mike and I
like doing it in public.
Huh. Those of us who wandered
by Santa's workshop at
the Christmas carnival...
Not that shocked.
You could try role-playing.
Once, I dressed up in
a french maid's costume,
and Orson pretended to
be a stubborn stain,
and why is everybody looking at me?
Seriously, guys, I need some new moves.
Well, there's this one mom at school...
and I promised
I wouldn't use her name...
Betty Cunningham...
who hired a stripper to teach her
how to give her husband a lap dance.
Well, I don't know what
a stripper could teach me,
but it's worth a shot.
You really think that's gonna work?
Why wouldn't it?
Because... I get where
Carlos is coming from.
This kind of guilt can
really mess with your head.
Something you wanna talk about?
Okay, the other day,
I accidentally took a case
of soda from the supermarket,
and the security guard
started yelling at me.
And at first, I was like, "No,"
but then I was like "Yes, I deserve it."
"I deserve to be punished."
It felt right to be publicly
humiliated like that,
and why is everybody looking at me?
'Cause there's a bucket of crazy
where your head used to be.
So now I'm crazy.
I thought you said I could
talk to you about this stuff.
You can,
and we appreciate what
you're grappling with,
but you cannot go around
attracting attention like that.
It's not safe.
Exactly.
So knock it off and go
get me some more coffee!
What? She likes to be yelled at.
Hey, you.
Uh, I thought you were, uh, at work.
I pronounce the city of Fairview
safe enough to have lunch with my girl.
Oh, that would be lovely,
but I have something
I need to do. Shoot.
Oh, yeah? Like what?
What?
Unless it's a... it's a big secret.
Is it a big secret?
Chuck.
I'm sorry. You're right. I...
You don't owe me any explanations.
I just... I just need
to know that we're okay.
Chuck...
My feelings for you have not changed,
just my schedule for the day.
Mwah.
Well, that's good,
because suspicion can be
a great trait in police work,
but it's horrible in a relationship.
Just ask my ex.
I never wanna be that guy again.
Hello there, Karen.
"Karen"?
What happened to "Liver spot"
or "6 feet under"
or one of your other cute nicknames?
No, no, I can't come in!
I'm just dropping off
another home-cooked meal!
What meal? What the hell
are you yelling for?
Just lift the napkin.
50 bucks. What's the catch?
Don't look now,
but do you see Ben over there?
Mm. Subtle.
Anyway, he has a soft
spot for old people,
and as far as he knows, so do I.
No, no, your crinkled little smile
is thanks enough for me.
Are you petting me?
Just say nice things about me to Ben.
Tell him I bring you meals,
that kind of stuff.
Well, it's a pretty big
favor for 50 bucks.
Considering I don't like you,
I'll do it for $100.
Fine.
Tomorrow I'll bring you a
c-note and a jell-o mold. Deal?
Oh, Renee.
Bless your heart. You're so good to me.
No, you're the one who enriches my life.
The joy I get...
Hands off. He's gone.
Oh, my god.
You think I sent this?
You have any idea how
this makes me feel?
Forgive me. I didn't
think it was possible
to damage the self-esteem of a murderer.
A confessed murderer.
And this-this is
the only way you can see me?
Paul! Paul.
Please.
I'm sorry. I've just been
so panicked since I got it.
It has the exact same wording as
the letter Mary Alice received.
Yes.
That's very weird.
But why are you so worked up about it?
I believe Mary Alice
got a little worked up
when she got hers.
But she was hiding something.
You aren't.
Right?
Of course not.
It's obviously just a cruel prank,
but I still wanna know
who's responsible.
It had to be someone who
knew about the original note.
Well, let's see.
Obviously there's Martha Huber.
Obviously she didn't send it.
Then there's you,
Susan, Lynette, Gaby.
I assume you've already asked them.
Uh, actually, I-I haven't
mentioned it to the girls yet.
I-I still haven't figured
out exactly what it is.
Well, whatever it is,
don't keep it to yourself.
If Mary Alice had shared
her note with you girls...
things might have turned out...
a whole different way.
You know it's recycling day.
So?
So it looks like you're about
to put kitchen garbage
in your recycling bin.
Oh. I hope I don't get punished.
Oh, here I am, dropping a turkey carcass
in with the recycling.
And here I am, not giving a crap.
Uh-oh. You got me.
Can I bum one?
My old lady made me quit.
17...
18...
19...
Thank god. Those were from last week.
Hello. Uh, Ben, isn't it?
Yes.
Uh, listen, uh,
I was just talking to Mrs. McCluskey,
and I gotta say, I really misjudged you.
Oh?
Yeah.
She was telling me all
the ways you've helped her.
Well, I like to think
I'm doing god's work,
you know, until he takes her
in her sleep or what have you.
Yeah, I don't know if you knew this,
but I'm quite involved
with seniors myself.
Get out! Look at us,
having things in common.
Yeah.
So is there something
else I can help you with?
Actually, yes. Are you free tonight?
Hey, buddy.
What are you thinking
for dinner tonight?
Mexican? Chinese?
Actually, there's a
party at Rich Cohen's
I was hoping to go to.
Yeah? Don't hope too hard.
Why not?
Remember when Rich turned 13?
It was the only bar mitzvah
ever shut down by the police.
I don't trust his parents.
Well, if you makes you feel better,
they're out of town.
Ooh, an unsupervised party? Even better.
We're just gonna be
eating pizza and watching
movies and stuff,
and Rich's older brother will be there.
Perfect. Someone to buy the beer.
So you're saying "No"? Again?
Uh...
I'm not saying no.
I'm saying ask your dad.
Hey! I'm just dropping off a check.
Hang on a sec. Parker has
something he wants to ask you.
Parker.
Can I go to a party at
Rich Cohen's house tonight?
What did your mom say?
His mom said he should ask his dad.
Oh. Well... H-his parents
are gonna be there, right?
Nope. No parents.
And... Rich Cohen...
didn't something happen
at his bar mitzvah?
Lots of things happened...
drinking, pot smoking,
the whittaker girl got pregnant.
It sounds like you already
made up your mind here.
No, no, no.
I have not made up my mind.
It is entirely up to you.
You hear that, dad? Entirely up to you.
Well... I-it seems like
your mom doesn't think
this is a good idea...
I didn't say that.
I don't not think it's a good idea.
Oh, so you do do think it's a good idea.
I don't not think it's not...
not... a good idea.
Okay, I'm confused.
Well, if your mom's not saying "No,"
I'm not saying "No" either.
Oh! Well, if your dad's not saying "No,"
I'm sure as hell not going to say "No."
So is that a "Yes"?
Well... it's not a "No."
Sweet.
Are you sure this thing is safe?
My son plays fireman
on mine all the time.
Do you wanna see a picture?
Let's not make this sadder than it is.
All right, so my husband's having
a little problem In the bedroom.
With his wiener?
Yes, with his... wiener.
Well, you can relax,
because I'm like a doctor,
and I see this problem all
the time with older women.
"Older"? Excuse me.
I don't think our ages
are that far apart.
When were you born?
1992.
Me, too. All right, enough chitchat.
Give me a taste of what
I'm gonna learn here.
Okay. I'd do ya.
Let me try.
That was kind of advanced.
I was thinking maybe we could
start with something simple,
Like grinding on a chair.
Okay, will you stop
treating me like a grandma?
I do yoga and zumba and kickboxing.
I'm in excellent shape.
Okay.
Not bad.
Okay, now ass up, legs out,
and remember, slow is sexy.
Oh, my god.
Okay. Uh... A little
harder than it looks.
No worries.
You'll pick it up in no time.
Six months tops.
What?! I can't wait that long.
I need your moves, your body...
My ass, but basically
I need to be you by tonight.
Hey, what are you doing tonight?
I'm headlining at Double D's.
If I triple your pay,
would you mind being
the opening act here?
Ben, I don't know how the food is,
but I already love this restaurant.
We are the youngest people here.
Oh, this isn't a restaurant.
This is the senior center.
Welcome to the Ben
Faulkner function room.
We're not eating here, are we?
No, no, we're serving.
We can eat afterwards if there are,
you know, leftovers.
Oh, fun.
Uh, but I'm... I'm a
little underdressed.
There you go.
There. Now you're perfect.
Gaby, F.Y.I., guys who used to be blind
don't enjoy reliving it.
Relax. You're gonna love this.
Now just sit back
and get ready for takeoff.
Yeah.
Wow. You've been working out.
I have... but that's not my ass.
It's a professional's.
Meet Dakota.
What the hell? What is this?
A gift from your wife.
I work at Double D's,
out by the interstate.
Not the one by the airport
that had the hepatitis scare.
You hired a stripper.
Only as a warm-up act.
Then later on, she'll clear out,
and it's just you and
me for the main event.
Nope. Not doing this.
Hang on. Idea. Sit down.
Oh! Okay. What are you doing?
I don't...
Oh, my god. He's right.
Your body... it's like a dolphin.
Give it a little spank.
Nothing will fix his problem quicker
than a little girl-on-girl action.
My "problem."
You told her.
Okay, quick. Make out with me.
Do you have any idea how
embarrassing this is for me?
Thank you, doctor. You can go now.
How could you do that to me?
Try to get our sex life back on track?
Carlos, even at our worst,
this is the one thing
that's always worked for us.
I just want us to get back to normal.
We're never going back to normal!
Don't you understand that?!
What I did...
you can't wish it away.
It is with me all the time,
whether I'm awake
or asleep...
or trying to make love to you.
I'm sorry. I just wish there
was something I could do.
There's not.
What's that?
I don't know.
Is it good?
Let me clue you in on something.
Food is usually either good or free.
How come you're dressed so fancy?
Because I'm on a date with
that hot Aussie over there.
He just failed to mention
what the date was.
Ben brought you to sling
food dressed like that?
Honey, I think he's messing with you.
I hope you had a good laugh.
Be thankful I shoved that on your head.
There was another option.
Renee, stop.
Why? So you can mock me some more?
I wasn't mocking you.
Okay, but I mean,
you did kinda deserve it...
I mean, your whole
"I heart old people" thing.
I was trying to find
something we had in common,
and now I know we have
nothing in common.
You're a good person who
does things like this,
and... I'm me.
You're not a good person?
No, Ben, I'm not.
Because truthfully,
doing charity makes me nauseous.
Yeah, me, too.
What?
Makes me uncomfortable, too,
but I know why that is.
Do you?
I don't want to talk about this.
Why? You afraid of saying
something truthful?
When my mom... died,
I was bounced around from
relative to relative,
most of them dirt-poor.
We were on the receiving
end of a lot of charity.
I spent plenty of time
in places like this.
And I hated it.
They hand you something...
a, uh, a dented can of
food or an ugly shirt.
And someone tells you,
"Say 'thank you' to the nice lady."
And you do, but secretly,
you wanna scream, "I hate you."
I know what it's like to claw
your way out of something.
Look at us...
having things in common.
It's about time.
Is there a problem, officer?
Yeah. You're parked in a fire zone.
Oh! Darn the luck, I am.
Well, sounds like
somebody's gonna be slapped
with a pretty steep fine.
Yeah, I should write you a ticket.
But if you promise not to do it again,
I'll let you off with a warning.
What? Why would you do that?
'Cause I'm a new dad.
Oh, jeez.
Abigail Dorothy Brovka,
8 pounds, 6 ounces.
I'm just so happy,
filled with love.
Anything short of a triple murder,
and I'm pretty much
looking the other way.
No, no. No, don't look the other way.
No, look this way.
Laws have been broken.
There must be consequences.
I just wanna get home to my baby.
I mean, look at her, all wrapped up
like the tastiest little
burrito in Fairview.
Oh, look at that.
Yeah.
Ah, well...
That was not cool.
Now fortunately for you,
I always carry a backup.
Are you kidding me?
What do I have to do
to get arrested here?
Lady, people like you
used to drive me nuts.
But nothing can faze me now
that this sweet little girl's
come into my life.
Well, that sweet little girl...
she's got dumbo ears.
Ma'am, you can turn around
and put your hands behind your back.
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say can and
will be used against you
in a court of law.
Hey, Mike.
Um, I, uh, I've got a bit of a problem.
Maybe you can help me out with it.
I can try. What's the problem?
You.
How am I supposed to hire you
when I can't get you bonded?
Who knew? Mike Delfino, suburban dad,
guy who keeps the neatest
lawn on the block,
Ex con?
Yep.
And you were gonna mention this when?
Look, I'm sorry. It's not
something I tend to lead with
when I meet somebody.
'cause you're not that guy anymore.
That's right.
A bad cop tried to rape your girlfriend,
and you fought him to protect her.
Tell me why you wouldn't
wanna be that guy anymore.
It was a long time ago.
I was a kid,
and I've learned life's a lot
more complicated than I thought.
Nah. Nah.
Life is brutally simple.
Life is getting what you want
and protecting who you love...
and everything else is weakness.
A guy like you...
guy like you knows it.
Ben, if this is all just to
tell me you can't use me,
I understand.
No, no, no, no, I didn't say that.
I said I couldn't bond you.
I can definitely use you.
I hope you've cooled off a bit.
Yeah. Well, uh,
spending a few hours in a cell
with a drunk transvestite
will do that to you.
Your baby's cute, by the way.
I swear she'll grow into those ears.
Thanks. The guy you called
to pick you up is here.
Carlos, thanks for coming.
I couldn't call Mike, and, uh,
I didn't wanna upset the girls, so...
You okay?
They told me you assaulted
a motorcycle cop.
Actually, it was just a motorcycle.
That doesn't sound like you.
I've been...
in this weird place lately.
I keep doing things,
hoping to get caught.
Does it help?
For five minutes.
And then I just feel guilty again.
I just don't know how to
pull myself out of this.
I get it.
Gaby keeps pushing me to act
like everything is normal.
I guess we're just supposed
to stuff everything down
and move on.
But that's impossible.
The girls are playing poker
and acting like things are fine,
and they're not.
It is nice to be able
to talk about this.
Ohh.
It is.
Do you wanna get some coffee?
Sounds good.
Parker, it's me.
It's getting late. Is everything okay?
Everything is fine, m'lady.
Who's this?
Toph.
If this is a booty call,
Toph is ready to fill in.
Where is Parker?
I don't know, man.
It's kind of
a "Lord of the flies" situation here.
So... are we hooking up or what?
Oh!
Parker!
Parker!
Excuse me, excuse me.
I'm looking for my son,
Parker Scavo... I'm hoping you know him.
Keg stand! Keg stand!
Keg stand! Keg stand!
And now I'm hoping you don't.
Keg stand! Keg stand!
Keg stand! Keg stand!
Whoa, hold on. This is a private party.
Uh, I'll just be a minute.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What are you, some kind of narc?
No, I'm just looking for my son,
I swear. I'm not a narc.
Exactly what a narc would say.
Step aside, kid.
Lady, I said no.
Listen to me. My son is here somewhere,
and he is probably drunk
and probably terrified,
and I have got to find him.
Sorry. There's no way we're
letting a narc into our party.
I am not... Ugh!
Okay.
Would a narc do this?
Legs!
Keg stand! Keg stand! Keg stand!
Keg stand! Keg stand!
Lynette?
Uh... Tom!
This isn't what it looks like.
I haven't been drinking.
I mean, a little.
What are you doing here?
Parker called me to pick him up
because he drank too much.
Where is he?
He's in the car. He sent me
back because he lost his phone.
Is he okay?
He's covered in puke,
which I'm hoping is-is his.
Oh, god.
This is your fault for
letting him come here.
My fault? You could have stopped him.
Oh, please. You knew it was a bad idea.
You were just too busy testing me.
No, I was giving you a chance
to stand up and be a father.
Now we've got a 16-year-old son
we have to clean off with a garden hose.
I guess you showed me.
He asleep?
Yeah. I thought
let him sober up before we punish him.
I know I shouldn't have
let him go tonight.
But right now saying "Yes"
is the only move I've got.
"Move"?
What is this?
Some kind of game you're trying to win?
Lynette, you have no idea
what this is like for me.
For 20 years, I had
the same bedtime ritual.
I-I brushed my teeth,
and I'd go look at each kid sleeping,
and no matter what crap
happened during the day,
I knew the things that
mattered were okay.
Now my ritual...
I brush my teeth.
So, yes.
I'm doing everything I can
to make the little time
that I spend with them
the best part of their week.
Wow. You're succeeding.
When I see them sprint out to the car,
so excited to see daddy,
part of me thinks, great.
They're okay with this,
and part of me thinks...
oh, crap.
I'm losing them to you.
So you're trying to win, too.
No.
I just...
I understand how you feel.
And the only way we're
gonna get through this
Is if we stop worrying about...
who wins.
I'm sorry to burden you with this,
but I just couldn't keep
it to myself anymore.
Why not? Why did you have to tell me?
Repression is, like, your thing.
Okay, let's-let's say someone knows.
They're not asking us for money.
They're not trying to blackmail us.
I say until they tell us what they want,
we just act like everything's normal.
Except I'm drinking a lot more.
You don't think we
should tell the others?
Well, we can't tell Susan.
She's already flipping out.
You're right.
And we shouldn't tell Lynette,
given what's going on in her marriage.
Or Carlos, given what's
going on in mine.
So you don't think
we should do anything?
Well, there is one thing
I've been telling you
you need to do. Get rid of Chuck!
You're right. I should, but, um...
But what?
This is gonna sound strange.
He makes me feel safe.
Safe? Yeah, I do think that's strange,
especially now that some lunatic knows.
But you've got to end this,
and you've got to end it now.
Chuck?
Now isn't that funny?
I was just thinking to myself,
"How am I gonna wash
my back in the shower?"
And then you walk in.
Serendipity, huh?
Sorry. I'm gonna pass.
Okay.
Is, um...
something on your mind?
It can wait.
Bree...
Go ahead. Take your shower.
Hello?
I have a collect call
from Fairview correctional institution.
Will you accept the charges?
Yes.
Bree, it's Paul Young.
I've been thinking about
what you asked me...
You know, who might have known
about Mary Alice's note.
Yeah?
When I confessed to
the murder of Martha Huber,
I mentioned the letter to the police.
Well, do you remember who
these policemen were?
The main detective was a tall guy
with a short name like,
uh, Pence or Vince.
Was it Vance? Chuck Vance?
Yes, that's it.
I have to go.
Okay. I know that was
the shortest shower
I've ever taken, but I...
I really didn't like
the look on your face before.
Be honest with me, Bree.
Are you about to break up with me?
Of course not.
In fact, let's get
you back in that shower.
Yes, in the divided
world of the suburbs,
everyone is looking for some
way to make a connection.
Some seek to connect by
focusing on a greater good...
Some by revealing a common history...
Some by sharing a pain
no one else can heal.
Then there are those
Who once sought to make a connection...
that they now want
desperately to escape.

Previously on Desperate Housewives...
Tom moved out of the house.
Tom and I are separating.
No.
After covering up a murder,
Gaby warned Bree it was a bad time
to be dating a cop.
Get rid of Chuck!
But you've got to end this,
and you've got to end it now.
Bree showed the mysterious letter to Paul,
who'd seen one like it before.
I mentioned the letter to the police.
The main detective was a tall guy
with a short name like, uh, Pence.
Was it Vance? Chuck Vance?
That's it.
Carlos struggled with remorse...
I just want us to get back to normal.
We're never going back to normal!
And discovered he wasn't
the only one feeling guilty.
It is nice to be able to talk about this.
You wanna get some coffee?
Susan Delfino and Carlos Solis
had never been the best of friends.
Susan thought Carlos
paid too much attention
to other people's opinions.
And Carlos thought Susan
didn't pay attention at all.
Over the years, they'd never
had much to say to one another.
But one night, Susan found
herself troubled by thoughts
she couldn't share with her spouse.
While two doors down,
Carlos was in the same predicament.
And that's how it came to pass
that two people who'd never
had much to say to one another
suddenly found...
they had a great deal to talk about.
So I leave the office,
walk into the parking garage,
and... there he is.
Alejandro.
Right in front of me.
I practically jump out of my skin.
Then I turn around again.
It's just some guy getting into his car.
This is not me.
I can't sleep. I'm seeing ghosts.
I feel like...
I'm walking around with
a neon sign on my forehead,
flashing "Guilty, guilty,"
and everybody can see it.
Sometimes I think I'm losing it.
Me, too.
I was getting ready to deck the guy.
Can you imagine?
Can I imagine?
I assaulted a cop, remember?
Oh, yeah. What happened with that?
15 hours of community service.
And I can't tell Mike.
It's one more thing
I'm lying to him about.
Well, I can talk to Gaby,
but she's sick of listening.
That's what this makes this feel so...
I know.
Can I tell you something?
When I went out walking tonight,
I was kind of hoping I'd run into you.
I was kinda hoping that, too.
You're kidding. You've never read
"To Kill a Mockingbird"?
In my school, if you read a book,
it was more like "To Kill a Sophomore."
Well, you would love it.
Um, it's about a guy
who tries to hang on
to his sense of right and wrong
when the system fails him.
Gee, I don't get that at all.
Oh. Your jacket. Thank you.
Yes, Susan and Carlos
were starting to pay
attention to one another.
Good night.
But what they didn't realize
was that someone else was
paying attention, too.
Wisteria Lane may look flawless,
but that's only because its residents
are so good at concealing imperfections.
They know how to make something
old look new again...
how to make an embarrassing
mistake disappear...
how to make a poor showing
look like a modest victory...
and how to make a friend feel better
after she's gone through a messy breakup.
Gaby, how thoughtful.
It's from that new place, Skinny Berry.
Tastes like a milkshake
but only 18 calories.
And I figured you could
use a little pick-me-up
after you dumped Chuck.
Yeah, well, about that...
Morning, women.
Morning.
Oh, is that... is that from Skinny Berry?
You know, the fraud unit's
all over that place, right?
Apparently those things
are like pure ice cream.
Huh! Guess you can't trust anybody.
Have a good day.
All right, I know what you're gonna say...
Three words... first word, "You're,"
third word, "Crazy,"
middle word... what you
keep doing to that guy!
You don't understand.
Damn right I don't.
You said you were gonna dump him.
I was.
But... I think Chuck wrote the letter.
The "I know what you did" letter?
What makes you think that?
I spoke to Paul Young, and...
Whoa, whoa. Why would you talk to Paul?
To find out who else knew
about Mary Alice's letter,
and he said that when he confessed
to killing Martha Huber,
Chuck was there.
Okay, but why would Chuck blackmail you?
He's already got the milk and the cow.
No offense. Just what else could he want?
Maybe he wants to control me.
Maybe he wants money. I don't know.
You've gotta start snooping.
What?
Yeah. Go through his stuff,
hack into his e-mails,
listen in on his phone calls.
I can't do that.
You have to, Bree.
Until we know what Chuck knows...
exactly what he knows,
it's not just you who's in danger.
It's all of us.
How's that pressure?
Ohh, perfect, and remember, Friedrich,
I've hidden your tip somewhere on my body.
It's up to you to find it.
Go away!
Renee! I need you.
Lee?
I am in crisis. I am at my wit's...
Well, hello.
Lee McDermott. Nice to meet you.
I'm Friedrich.
Ooh, like in "The sound of music"?
Nothing? Okay. He plays for your team.
Anyway, I need a huge favor.
I don't do favors. You know that.
It's for Jenny.
Oh, your daughter?
Yeah.
No.
Oh, please.
I am desperate.
When Bob and I adopted her,
we agreed that I would take care of
the "Time of the month" talk,
and Bob would handle all things bra.
Well, that bastard is in Tokyo,
and the boobie fairy has arrived.
The boobie fairy?
See why I should not be
the one handling this?
I was hoping... maybe you
could take her shopping?
Oh, man up. It's just a bra.
They terrify me.
Too many numbers and letters and colors,
and it's my little girl growing up,
and I can't deal.
Ohh, yes.
So you'll do it?
No, he just found his tip.
Renee!
Fine. I'll take her, but only for an hour,
and no small talk.
Oh, bless you.
I will never forget you for this. Mwah.
Look! Ricky Martin! Eating a banana!
Just checking.
Oh, please come with us.
You've bra shopped with Penny.
And maybe one of your older boys,
if I'm guessing right.
I can't. I have plans.
Oh, that's right. Tom's got the kids,
and you have this whole place to yourself.
What are you gonna do?
Oh, sweetie.
Some man who's not married to you
is gonna have to see that body soon.
Do not do this.
It's not for me. My sister's coming.
Lydia? The disaster?
Yeah. Out of the blue, she called
and says she wants to visit.
You know what that means.
She got dumped.
After loaning him a lot of money.
And finding out he's married.
In two states. So... I gotta
get the whole toolkit ready
so after she crash-lands here,
I can pick up the pieces.
Uh, I'm going out the back door.
I hate to see people crying.
It reminds me how little
I actually care about others.
Coming!
Oh, hi.
Lynnie.
Ohh.
You look...
You look fantastic.
You thought I'd be my usual blubbery mess
of snot and tears, didn't you?
What? No.
Well, that's not me anymore.
Thanks to Rashi, I'm a changed woman.
Rashi? Oh, god. Did you get a dog?
No, silly. I got engaged
to the greatest guy in the world.
Oh, and, Lynette,
I'm so sorry about you and Tom.
But don't worry. I'm here to help.
Hey. Sorry I'm late.
Grocery store was a madhouse.
I actually had to fight
a woman over the last chicken.
Susan...
Unfortunately, she was Slavic...
a very sturdy people,
so I hope you like cereal.
Susan, stop. I just got off the phone
with the guy from the county.
Something about your
court-ordered community service
for assaulting a policeman.
Oh. That.
Yeah, that.
W... it's so ridiculous.
I was... trying to fight a...
parking ticket,
and I knocked over the cop's bike.
Um, and I maybe told
him his baby was ugly.
He... he blew the whole
thing out of proportion.
Well, you know what
I'm blowing out of proportion?
The guy on the phone
called me "Mr. Solis."
Right.
Because, um...
Carlos picked me up at
the, uh, police station,
which I know sounds weird...
why him and not you...
I was just, uh, so embarrassed,
I... I didn't wanna tell you.
So there's nothing going
on with you and Carlos?
I shouldn't be worried
about your little moonlight
stroll last night?
Have you been taking fighting lessons
from that Slavic lady?
Mike, come on.
I couldn't sleep. Carlos couldn't sleep.
We ran into each other, and we talked.
About what? You barely know him.
The first eight years we lived here,
you called him Ricky Ricardo.
He's... going through something,
and I'm helping him.
Yeah? Tell me. What's he going through?
It's personal.
Okay, Mike, Carlos and I are just friends.
I don't mind you being friends with a guy.
It's all the sneaking around and the lying
I'm having a hard time with.
So she waltzes in to
my advanced yoga class
even though, clearly,
she's never done yoga before.
Well, the teacher of the beginner's class
wasn't nearly as cute as you.
And then I, uh, go over
and correct her cobbler pose, right?
And our eyes meet.
And three weeks later, he gives me this.
Wow, that's some rock.
Literally, it's a rock.
I saw it on the beach after class.
It calls out to me,
and I feel like I might need it someday.
And you did. Isn't the universe amazing?
Amazingly thrifty.
Okay.
So this is my third glass.
I'm saying mean things,
but I'm not getting a buzz.
The wine is alcohol-free.
So this night's not getting any better.
Ever since Rashi did
a liver cleanse on me,
I haven't had a drop to drink.
You got Lydia to give up wine?
You should take your act to Vegas.
It's not an act.
I'm gonna go grab some
spices out of the van.
Okay, who are you kidding?
You can't marry that sunflower seed.
I'm not kidding anybody.
I love him.
In fact, he's leading
a meditation seminar...
at Kerrigan Park.
Why don't you come?
It might help you deal with
your marriage crashing.
My marriage did not crash.
Tom and I are separated.
Exactly why you should be
doing some "Lynette work."
Come on. It'll be fun.
Six hours of silence in
a traditional mountain yurt.
I promise you, Lydia,
if you drag me to a yurt,
two will go in, one will come out.
Careful. That's our tax
dollars you're dripping.
Sorry.
You need to pace yourself.
You're gonna need lots of paint
to cover that gigantic banana over there.
Uh... I don't think that's a banana.
Hey, I worked hard on that graffiti.
What are you doing here?
"To kill a mockingbird."
I started reading it last night.
It was so good.
I couldn't wait to talk to you about it.
Yeah, well, I'm kinda beautifying the city
at the moment.
Don't you get a lunch?
Look, Carlos, Mike found out
we were spending time together,
and he's a little weird about it,
so I don't think we should be
having any intimate lunches.
Why is he weird? I mean,
nothing's going on.
No, of course not, but somehow...
us meeting in the middle of the night
and me lying about it was
kind of a red flag for him.
Okay.
Well, if lunch is too intimate...
How about... I help with the beautifying?
I guess there's no harm in that.
Excuse me.
Are you here for community service?
Nope, just trying to be a good citizen.
Can't. Not unless you committed a crime.
Are you serious?
Yeah.
There.
I littered.
Jenny, trust me.
You want Jackson to notice you,
ice him out.
Don't talk to him. Don't look at him.
Maybe have sex with his best friend.
I mean, have a soda. Got it?
Totes.
What happened to you guys?
You were supposed to
be back two hours ago.
Uh, we went shopping.
Here's your credit card.
Oh, and by the way, I upped your limit.
3 grand? What are you, a nurse?
So... tell me all about your day.
O.M.G. I want to see
everything you bought.
Dad, you're like a million years
too old for "O.M.G."
I'm gonna try the makeup you got me.
Wait. You got her makeup?
She's 11.
Uh, she wears a bra now.
Think she's ready for
strawberry lip gloss.
Tell me what happens with Jackson.
I want all the deets.
"Deets." I love you.
Well, look at you two, all B.F.F.
So who's this Jackson?
I would like those deets.
Oh, she asked me not
to tell anyone about him.
I'm not anyone. I'm her co-father.
Well, don't take it personally.
There are just some things
girls would rather talk about
with other girls.
I could be a girl.
I could totally be a girl!
Well, you got the voice down.
Hey, where are you?
In the kitchen! Come join me.
Smells amazing. What are you making?
Oh, seared tilapia, bearnaise sabayon,
and a little bok choy.
Mind giving me a hand?
Bree, the only word I recognized
in that sentence was "Hand."
Come on. There's nothing to it.
This is bearnaise sauce.
It just needs ten minutes
of constant whisking.
Constant.
Look at you. You're a natural.
I'm gonna go dress for dinner.
Now remember, keep
whisking for ten minutes.
If your hand starts to spasm,
it means you're doing it right.
Bree, I think it's been ten minutes!
No! No, not even close!
Keep whisking till it's light and frothy!
Okay, I don't care how long it's been,
that stuff ain't getting any frothier.
And I got a cramp in my shooting hand.
So if a criminal gets away tomorrow,
it'll be your fault.
I'm so sorry.
Here. Let me, uh, massage it for you.
He took a picture of your
hand while you were sleeping?
How creepy is that?
I know. Why would he do such a thing?
Oh, my god.
What?
He must have found a
handprint at the crime scene.
He pulled your print off the photo,
and they were a match.
Is that possible?
I don't know.
Well, then what's in the envelope?
Maybe the cell phone or a
piece of the shovel handle.
Whatever it is, that's what
he's gonna use to nail us.
Well, we have to get that envelope,
and I can't keep distracting
him by having him stir sauces.
By the way, his bearnaise... disaster.
Okay. Tonight when he gets home,
you take him for a long walk,
leave the back door open,
and I'll do the rest.
Got it.
What if the briefcase is locked?
I can pick locks. Yeah.
I can also disguise my voice,
forge people's signatures,
and I'm a decent pickpocket.
Adultery gave me some
valuable life skills.
Fractions are so stupid.
I'm never gonna need this stuff anyway.
Are you kidding me?
Let's say you marry a guy
who's worth $20 million.
You divorce him, and he gives you half,
but your prenup says
you get three-quarters.
That extra $5 million gets you a yacht,
because you learned your fractions.
True story, by the way.
Hello? It's Lee!
Hey! Come on up.
You know, you'd be a really cool mom.
You think so?
No, I'd probably just leave
the kid in a nightclub
or... Morocco.
Hey. What are you doing here?
What am I doing here?
I'm looking for my daughter,
who said she'd be home by 5:00.
I guess we got carried away.
Totes.
Use the whole word!
How much time are you saving?
Calm down.
Can you stay out of this?
This is between me and my daughter.
Stop. You're embarrassing me.
I don't care.
You need to come home with me... now.
What if I say I'm not ready to leave?
What if I say you're grounded for a week?
Should we keep going?
What?! You are so unfair!
Aren't you being a little hard on her?
Back off, Renee. You're not her mother.
Mmm. My sweet, that was your
most delicious meal yet.
What was in this?
Uh, just walnuts, hemp curds,
and one very special ingredient.
Please don't say "Love,"
because I'm already nauseous.
I find that a walk after a meal
helps encourage my digestive flow.
Anybody care to join me?
You go. I'll clean up.
No, Lynette!
That's full of poison.
Yes, delicious, creamy poison,
which, by the way,
you used to suck down by the gallon.
Yes, I know, but I've changed.
And I wanna help you change, too.
It's why I'm here.
Wow. That's a bigger load of crap
than the one we just ate.
Excuse me?
You're not here for me.
You're here because for once,
you're the one in the happy relationship,
and you just couldn't
wait to rub my face in it.
How could...
Why do you al... No.
No, no, no, no. No.
You won't drag me down to your level.
I am surrounded by a beautiful bubble
of loving energy.
Yes, Lydia,
you are in a bubble,
but once the pebble collector
dumps you like they all do,
you'll go right back to
being the ice cream-binging,
wine-swilling,
neurotic mess you really are.
Pop!
You are so mean. God, I hate you.
There she is. Welcome back.
My whole life, you've
treated me like a screwup.
You always had to be the happy one,
the smart one, the married one.
Well, guess what?
Now you're the screwup, bitch.
You're alone and miserable,
and I love it.
I love it, I love it,
I love it, I love it!
Wow.
I just, uh, forgot my iPod.
Wow.
Uh-oh. A chardonnay float.
Does that mean...
Yes.
Rashi's gone to the retreat alone,
so... congratulations.
Now I'm just as miserable as you are.
Did he... dump you?
He said now that he's seen the real me,
he needs to meditate on whether
or not he can still marry me.
I'm so screwed, dude.
You know, if he was that quick to run off,
maybe he's not the guy.
He's the guy.
I'm just not the girl.
I thought I could put all
that loser stuff behind me
and actually have
a functional relationship.
I guess that's too much to ask for.
Why don't you go talk to him?
I can't.
After how I behaved,
I've been told my energy is
no longer welcome in the yurt.
Where is she?
Where is who?
Jenny. She's supposed to be grounded,
but when I went to her room
to check on her, she was gone.
Well, she's not here.
I've been out all afternoon.
I don't think I trust you.
Jenny? Are you in here?
This is all your fault, you know.
My fault? How is it my fault?
I'm sorry. I'm not
speaking to you right now.
We were a perfectly happy family
before you got involved.
Got involved? You made
me take her shopping
'cause you're scared of boobs!
Yeah, and then you glommed on
because you don't have kids of your own.
It's not her fault!
Jenny.
I snuck in a back window.
Sorry.
What's going on? Why are you here?
I like it here. We did our nails.
More.
I don't know.
Sometimes I think it'd
be cool to have a...
mother.
Oh, my god. The "M" word.
Easy.
What can a mother do that I can't?
You wanna do your nails?
Mani-pedi Mondays start next week.
You want to try on shoes?
I have the stilettos that Cher wore
to the "Moonstruck" Premiere.
You can't go in the ladies' room with me.
So that's the problem?!
Well, you've got me.
I see why having a dad and
a papa is so horrible.
Jenny, why don't you go in the kitchen?
The latest "Vogue" is in there.
We have magazines at our house, too!
Are you okay?
This is my worst nightmare come true.
I've worried about this moment
ever since she came into our lives.
What if Bob and I aren't enough?
What if she does need a mother?
Oh, shut up.
Excuse me?
You took a girl who was bouncing
from one foster home to another
and gave her two great
parents who love her.
But you heard her. It's not enough.
Oh, please, she's a kid.
Today she wants a mom.
Tomorrow she'll want a car.
Jenny is not lacking for anything,
and you guys are doing
an amazing job with her.
Really?
Yeah, really.
So amazing, that for
the first time in my life,
I... actually enjoyed
hanging out with a kid.
Aw. Thank you.
And I take back everything I said
about you being an insensitive bitch.
Uh, you never said that.
Don't open your e-mail.
We are the sun,
the warmth radiating from our hearts.
We are the endless sea rolling
beneath the forever sky.
We are the leaves.
The wind blows us from trees.
Sorry, sorry. Stupid wind.
We are the stars,
glowing, growing,
losing ourselves but gaining the universe.
You got a sec?
What are you doing here?
Besides trying not to laugh my ass off?
I need to talk to you.
Well, not now!
My students have been
meditating for six hours.
They are very close to
finding their bliss.
I'm sure they can spare
you for a few minutes,
so come talk to me,
or I will start singing Ethel Merman
at the top of my lungs.
There's no business like show business
there's no...
So sorry.
I'll be right back.
Come on.
You can't leave Lydia.
I don't want to, but I didn't recognize
that person I saw yelling at you.
I did. It's the person I turn her into
every time we get together.
The Lydia I didn't recognize was the one
who breezed through my house,
happy and in love.
You don't understand. It's too hard for me
to be around people like you and Lydia.
Then... eat a root or chant or whatever.
It's not gonna help, okay?
Why not?
Because you are exactly like my family.
My name is not Rashi.
It's Herbert Brickmeyer,
from Levittown, Long Island,
and that energy in your kitchen...
that was pure Brickmeyer,
and I can't be around that again.
Okay. Okay, first of all,
Lydia doesn't act like that when
I'm not pushing her buttons.
And even if she did, work it out.
That's what a relationship is.
And you're a relationship expert?
I'm an expert on screwing them up.
I'm guessing it took you a while
to stop being a crazy
Long Island Brickmeyer,
so give Lydia a little time
to find her bliss, too.
I'll think about it.
All this talk about my family's
got me really jonesing for a cigarette.
You wouldn't happen to...
Sorry, Herb.
Hi.
Hi.
What?
Rashi called.
He had an epiphany during the retreat.
He knows I'm changing,
and he's willing to be patient.
He's right. You are changing.
I have never seen you like this before.
Really?
Yeah, really, honey.
I think...
I think that is why I have
been so rotten to you.
I'm jealous.
Why?
I don't get in relationships, Lydia.
I get on them.
I mount them and grab them by the hair
and kick them in the sides
until I make them go where I want.
And god help the other person
if they have a different idea than me.
Is that what happened with you and Tom?
Oh, yeah.
You can change, too, Lynette.
I don't know if I can.
I'm pretty sure this
is as good as it gets.
No, Lynette.
No, because you recognize
your problem now.
And a wise man once said
that to begin the journey of change,
we must pull on
the boots of self-awareness.
And was that wise man Rashi?
Isn't he adorable?
And when he talks to Scout and Jim,
you know he doesn't wanna
just do the right thing
for the community. He wants to
do the right thing as a father.
I know. It's like when Gregory Peck
looks at those kids,
you can tell that he's...
Gregory Peck?
You didn't actually
read the book, did you?
Yeah. I started, and then it was on cable.
I'm sorry. It's just too many pages.
Mike.
What?
Oh, god. He's turning around!
Okay.
Uh... Okay, come on.
Do you think he saw us?
I don't know.
I don't see his truck. I think he left.
Oh, thank god.
Wow, that was close.
Yeah, my heart's pounding.
I know. I can feel it.
What is going on here?
Nothing.
Are you sure?
Yeah. We're just two friends
who are going through
a tough time and are trying to
help each other through it, right?
Then why are we hiding
in the back of a van
from my husband?
I don't think we should do this anymore.
Yeah.
Mike! What are you doing?
When you're done helping your boyfriend,
we need to talk.
You okay?
Yeah.
Hello.
How was your day?
It was a little stressful.
Ah. Mine, too.
We need to unwind.
How about a nice, long walk?
I have a better idea.
There's someplace special
I'd like to take you.
Oh? Where?
It's a surprise.
I don't really like surprises.
I do. Shall we?
Now?
Uh, can I freshen up first?
You look plenty fresh to me.
But I've been in these clothes all day.
I'd really like to change.
Okay. Don't keep me waiting.
Bree, have you left yet?
New plan. He's taking me out,
and he's got the envelope.
Where are you going?
He won't say,
but if he wrote that letter,
and he's bringing me somewhere
with the evidence...
This is when he gives you the shakedown!
I'll follow you.
I thought you were gonna change.
I did.
My attitude. I didn't wanna go,
but now I do.
Uh, what about that...
that table in the corner?
We'd like some privacy.
No, no, no, no. I hate privacy.
I like noise and bustle
and lots of people.
How about this one in the middle?
Whatever you say.
Oh, aren't you warm in that jacket?
Actually, a little.
So, um, let's order first,
and then we can talk.
Don't these appetizers sound delicious?
Yum! Escargot, and I...
I love onion soup.
But it'll be hard to pass
up on the beef tartare.
Rustic country pate. Look.
Uh, what am I looking at?
It just says "Rustic country pate."
Maybe we should look on
the left side of the menu.
I definitely think we'll find
something good on the left side.
We didn't get a wine list.
Where's our waiter?
I'll be right back.
Wait. Where... where are you going?
To freshen up.
Again?
What do you think's in there?
What if it's a bone? You open it!
Oh, no.
Maybe it's a tooth?
Ohh. The picture of my hand...
He was trying to figure out my ring size.
Well, this doesn't necessarily
mean he didn't send the letter.
I think it does.
Okay, well, this is a relief, right?
I mean, at least
he's not blackmailing you.
No, it means he wants to marry me.
So what are you gonna do?
I like Chuck, but he's not the man
I wanna spend the rest of my life with.
You can go. I'll do my
best to let him down easy.
Some rock, and on a cop's salary?
But you should still dump him.
Mike.
If you're gonna say it, say it fast.
There is no fast way to say it, buddy.
What the hell are you doing here?
We're finally gonna tell you the truth.
About a month ago,
the progressive dinner...
you remember that night?
Just get to the part that's the truth.
I killed Gaby's stepfather.
And me and the girls helped cover it up.
I'm sorry that took so long.
Oh, that... that-that's all right.
It actually gave me a chance
to have a scotch and a glass of red wine.
Calm my nerves a little.
God, I wish I could have a drink.
Why? What are you nervous about?
I have something important to say.
Huh. Um, I-I wonder
If it's the same thing that I'm gonna say.
I'm pretty sure it's not.
Chuck, you are a wonderful man,
and I have enjoyed
our time together, but...
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Are you... are you...
you're dumping me?
I was...
I was about to propose to you.
I'm sorry if I misled you...
Hey, there's a fake apology.
You did mislead me.
Chuck, please...
You know, it's like you're two people.
There's the woman I have fun with,
who I really... I really connect to,
and there's this other woman who's...
who's, uh, who's mysterious and-and weird
and keeps sneaking out to "Run errands."
There's another guy, isn't there?
No. I assure you, there's no one else.
Don't lie to me!
Was he the one who sent you that letter?
What letter?
The one that you, uh,
you were reading the other night,
you got all shook up about...
Was that from him?
There is no "Him."
You know, Bree,
I would've done anything for you.
I protect the people that I care about.
I don't care about you now.
So if you find yourself in trouble,
and I'm pretty sure
that someday you will...
Then don't come calling me.
You have made a very big mistake.
Yes, the residents of Wisteria Lane
are skilled at the art of concealment.
They know how to cover
the evidence of a messy breakup...
to compensate for what their
children might be missing...
and to spare the feelings of a loved one
whose taste they may not share.
But for some,
the art of concealment
comes at too great a cost.
And so they find themselves
forced to reveal the truth...
even at the risk of facing
an uncertain future.

We have some serious problems
that are gonna require serious work.
Lynette and Tom struggled
with their separation.
Mike heard a confession...
I killed Gaby's stepfather.
Aah! Uhh!
And me and the girls helped cover it up.
That could change
his life with Susan forever.
Bree showed Gaby the note...
Let's say someone knows.
I say until they tell us what they want,
we just act like everything's normal.
And decided she needed
to end her relationship
with detective Vance.
You know, Bree, I would
have done anything for you.
You have made a very big mistake.
It's often said that children learn
their most important lessons
outside the classroom.
They learn to find peaceful
ways to resolve conflict...
to make smart choices about nutrition...
to master the art of conversation.
But for Gabrielle Solis,
the art of morning drop-off...
What's taking so long? Come on! Let's go!
Was something she'd never learned.
You slow down, push the kid out,
and drive off!
Why is it so hard?!
You realize I have to go
to this school, right?
Oh, come on. I'm behind
the wheelchair kid?
That's it, Juanita. Get out.
I'm not allowed till
we get to the green zone
and a volunteer opens the door.
Remember what happened last week?
Yeah, last week I made it
to my hot stone massage.
Just keep your head down,
pretend like you don't
speak english, and run.
Hold it!
Ohh.
Hi, Dana. I didn't see you there.
Looks like someone didn't learn her lesson
the last two times
she broke the drop-off rules.
Three strikes, Solis.
You're out.
Wh... Hey!
I need that!
Your drop-off privileges
have been revoked.
From now on, you'll be
parking in the "B" lot
and walking Juanita to class.
The "B" lot?
That's, like, a mile away.
These don't walk.
They do now.
Oh, yeah? Well, who died
and made you boss?
Margaret Frye. Cancer.
Oh. Right. I still owe for those flowers.
Oh, relax, Pam! You'll still
make it to weight watchers!
Problem here, Dana?
Oh, great. Now the pips are here.
It's Solis again.
She's holding up traffic.
Yeah, and I'm not moving till
you give me back my placard.
Oh, Pam, eat a carrot!
Tell you what.
If you can take the placard
from me, you can keep it.
You know what? I'm not a child.
I'm not gonna give you the satisfaction...
Oh!
You know what, Dana?
Just because you're head of P.T.A.
doesn't mean you get to make the laws!
Oh, I have news for you.
Here at Oakridge, I am the law.
Yes, some of our most important lessons
are learned outside the class room.
And when it came to school politics,
Gabrielle's education was just beginning.
When it came to her separation,
Lynette Scavo was determined
to do everything by the book.
She made sure her visitation days
were evenly divided.
She kept perfect records
of her household expenses.
She found healthy ways
to relieve her stress.
Yes, Lynette was confident
her by-the-book approach
was the right one,
sadly, not everyone was on the same page.
Well, look who cleaned
out the sad-sack aisle
at the bookstore.
At least your divorce is good
for the publishing industry.
We're not using the "D" word.
It's a separation.
Tom and I are going to
"Heal through counseling"
so we can find "A road to reconnection"
and if not,
"Murder on the orient express."
Penny, your dad's here!
Explain something to me.
If you're trying to win back your husband,
why do you dress like you
sell oranges by the freeway?
Hey. Sorry I'm late.
I had to stop at the store,
and it took longer than I expected.
Because you tawt you taw a puddy tat?
Ha ha.
It's just a teeth whitener.
Teeth whitening, huh?
And unless sweat suits are
the new business casual,
it looks like you're working out, too.
I'm trying. It helps cheer me
up when the kids aren't around.
Daddy!
Hey!
Oh! Remember to get Parker at practice.
I love you. Have fun at your dad's.
I love you. Bye.
Drive safe.
Hmm.
I've got a new book title for you...
"Your husband's banging somebody."
What?
Chapter one... white teeth.
Chapter two... working out.
Chapter three... the nasty.
He's just trying to take
better care of himself.
Oh, Lynette.
I expect you to be naive about hair,
makeup, and fashion,
but about this?
Trust me. Tom has hooked up.
He's not. He's not. If he was...
dating someone,
he would tell me.
He would.
Right?
That doesn't look too suspicious.
Oh.
I'm sorry. Just...
every time I check the mail,
I'm afraid it's gonna be
another one of those letters.
It's been three weeks.
Maybe we're out of the woods.
Please don't say "Woods."
I'm just saying, if someone
was trying to blackmail us,
they're not very good at it,
since they haven't asked
for money or anything.
Well, what happened to them?
Did they just disappear?
If we're lucky.
Now that Chuck the cop
is out of your life,
Susan's acting normal,
I think we're in the clear.
Oh, good. Here they are. Hmm.
Oh, Danielle and Benjamin.
Fun. What's the occasion?
Her husband left her.
Ugh. Okay. Well, I'd stay and say hi,
but that would involve a lot
of listening and sad nodding.
Oh, honey, I am so sorry
about you and Leo.
Thanks, mom.
Not that I didn't see it coming.
That didn't take long.
Neither did the marriage.
So how are you holding up?
My husband left me. It sucks.
But you know how that feels.
You just got dumped by that cop, right?
Um...
Actually, I am the one
who ended it with Chuck.
He wanted to marry me, bought me a ring,
but that's not important.
This week...
or weeks is about you.
We are gonna make a plan to
put your life back together.
A plan? Mom, this all just happened.
Give me a few days to eat
ice cream and veg out.
Of course, honey.
I promised you on your wedding day
that I would be here when he left you.
You know what?
Maybe we'll just crash on Andrew's floor.
What? That's so uncomfortable.
Not as bad as staying here and
getting picked apart by you.
I promise I won't criticize you.
Besides, if you sleep on Andrew's floor,
you'll need a tetanus shot.
What? I said I wouldn't criticize you.
I didn't say anything about your brother.
Okay, I know that last night
I said you could take
all the time you need
to work through what
Carlos and I told you,
but...
while you're taking all the time you need,
you think you could maybe...
tell me that you still love me?
I mean...
if you still love me?
There is nothing you could do
that would make me stop loving you.
Mike, it was so hard
to keep this from you,
like, the hardest thing I've ever done.
Well, at least I understand
why you've been so distant.
And to be honest,
I'm kind of relieved you
weren't having an affair.
Well, now that you know,
I just want everything
to go back to normal.
Okay, but I hope you realize
it might not be that easy.
Take it from a guy who's
done things like this.
They don't just disappear.
Yeah, I know that.
But I think if I focus on other stuff
and move on with my life,
it'll be okay.
Great.
And first step?
I'm taking a painting
class at the college.
It's being taught by Andre Zeller.
Okay, that means nothing to you.
It's like I'm taking a football class
from Peyton Manning.
Whoa.
It's just what I need.
I think it'll be a great way
to take my mind off
everything that's happened.
So I'm gonna get my portfolio together.
Mr. Zeller has to approve
all his students.
Not that I'm worried.
Oh, and, Mike,
from now on, I swear,
no more secrets between us.
Is that my school?
The tiny, little building way down there?
It would've been faster
if we just walked from home.
Hey.
First time in the "B" lot, huh?
Welcome.
What are you in for?
Practically nothing.
I let my kid get out
of the car by herself.
Ooh.
Dana take your placard?
Yeah, but I'll get it
back in a day or two.
Are you kidding?
She'll have you in here
for the rest of the year.
What? She can't do that.
Oh, you wanna bet?
I took a cell phone
call in the green zone.
That was two months ago.
My kid had peanut butter
crackers in his lunchbox.
I'm looking at four to six.
This is crazy.
No, this is Dana.
Dana "The pain-a." Pfft!
Dana "You better not complain-a."
Dana "Power's driving me insane-a."
Oh, my god. Is this what
the "B" lot does to you?
That, four kids,
and the flask in her purse.
Well, if everyone thinks
she's such a pain-a,
how'd she get the job?
It's an elected position.
We voted for her.
Well, not me. I don't vote.
All right, when's the next P.T.A. meeting?
There's one thursday.
Okay. I say we band together,
storm that meeting, and go all
"Braveheart" on Dana's ass.
Who's with me?
You guys not seen "Braveheart"?
I know it's an old reference,
but this is when you go, "Yeah!"
Yeah.
Oh, god. Come on.
If every fed-up mom in
this "B" lot shows up,
we can break our shackles,
get our placards back.
We can... oh! The movie "300."
This is Sparta!
You've seen that, right?
Yeah!
Okay. I'll see you ladies thursday.
Mm-hmm.
This is excellent work.
Thank you, Mr. Zeller.
Now I know what you're thinking...
why does a professional
artist who can do this
want to take a painting class?
That is what I'm thinking.
Well, mainly because I'm
a huge fan of your work.
That series you did based
on Dante's "Inferno,"
the one with the guy chewing
the other guy's head off...
I wish I could paint like that.
You're very kind,
but then again, look what
you've done with these bunnies.
Um, do you start with watercolor
and then outline with rapidograph...
Actually, it's the other way around.
I have a very steady hand.
Well, clearly.
My compliments, Ms. Delfino.
Technically, this is very impressive.
Oh, thank you.
So...
obviously, I'm in.
No. Obviously, you're out.
What?
Don't get me wrong.
You're a fine illustrator,
but this isn't what I call art.
Excuse me, but my paintings
have been in dozens of books,
some of them bestsellers.
Perhaps you've heard of
"Doctor porcupine"?
He has a very prickly bedside manner.
Right. But see, when you say "Art,"
you mean a hedgehog with a stethoscope,
and to me, art means
reaching down your throat,
tearing your guts out,
and smearing it all over canvas.
Anger, passion... that's what interests me.
Well, uh,
"Doctor porcupine loses a
patient and kills a hooker"
doesn't have the same ring to it.
I'm looking for serious
students of the medium.
You're a bored housewife
trying to kill time
between spin class and driving
your kid to soccer practice.
Hey, that's not fair.
Um, just because
I've done children's books
doesn't mean I can't do anything else.
Really? Do you have any work
that reflects what
I've been talking about?
Of course I do.
I'll bring it in tomorrow.
I would bring it in now,
but I have to pick up my son...
from prison.
In 1985, musician Bob Geldof
organized a benefit concert
to fight famine in...
There you are.
Though I don't know why I'm surprised.
It's where you've been
the last three days.
Guatemala. It's Guatemala!
Ethiopia.
Loser.
Ethiopia is correct! Congratulations.
Well, given that you won't be
making your fortune off game shows,
perhaps it's time we had
that talk about your future.
Mom, I'm still healing.
My marriage fell apart.
You, of all people,
should know how that feels.
Yes, and I sat in that
same chair "Healing"
and eventually turned
into a raging alcoholic.
Oh, man.
Wine sounds really good right now.
We should get a bottle.
What, you can't even have a sip?
No! Now you need to think about
putting your life back together,
getting a job.
You have a son to consider.
Oh, jeez.
I found you!
Now go hide, and we'll play again!
One, two, three...
Okay, there is something
I've been thinking about doing.
Oh. What job?
Retail? Waitressing?
Better. My own business.
I designed this exercise equipment,
and I think I could
sell it on the internet.
Danielle, what do you know
about starting a business?
I already have the design,
and I wrote up a business plan.
I think it could really work.
All I need is a little
seed money. Say $5,000?
$5,000?
Well, I need the supplies,
and I have to rent a place to work out of.
I will give you $500,
and you can use the test kitchen.
Seriously?
Mom, thank you so much.
This means a lot to me.
Well, I am very proud of you.
And you know what?
You are setting a wonderful
example for Benjamin.
Oh, crap.
Ready or not, here I come!
Hey. Sorry I'm late.
I hope you don't mind If I have my lunch
while we go over our schedules.
That's lunch?
Protein shake.
Just trying to stay, uh, lean and mean.
I did that once.
All I got was mean.
Hey, I had to move my meeting
to wednesday afternoon.
Think you can pick up the kids?
I'll cover Penny's orthodontist on friday.
Sure. And saturday,
Parker has that birthday.
Since that's your day,
you can have him longer on sunday,
if you want.
Great. Yeah. Okay.
That is everything on my end. You?
Um, I heard back from
that couples counselor.
She can squeeze us in thursday at 6:00.
I mean, if you still
want to go to therapy.
Absolutely.
Oh.
I can make thursday work.
Good. I'll book the appointment.
Hello?
Hey.
Y... hey, can I call you back?
Okay. O-okay. Hold-hold on a sec.
Um, this is a work thing.
Is there anything else you need from me?
Uh, no.
Okay. Okay.
I will... see you thursday.
Okay.
Hey, sorry about that. I, uh, I was in...
Let me get this straight, Jill.
For back to school night appetizers,
you're suggesting pretzels?
What are we, a public school?
Hey. Sorry.
Hey.
Did you guys know there was
an A.A. meeting in the gym?
I sat through five
"I left my kid in the car"
"while drinking" stories
before I realized I was
in the wrong place.
Doughnut?
Gabrielle Solis.
What brings you to your
first ever P.T.A. meeting?
Same thing that brought
our founding fathers to...
wherever they went
when all that crap happened
with England... freedom.
Freedom?
Yeah, that's right.
Freedom to oppose an unjust ruler
and her unjust placard-stealing ways.
We are here to tell you your
reign of terror is over.
Right, girls?
Guys, come on!
Melissa, have you forgotten about
the blood blister you got
hiking from the "B" lot?
And you... other woman,
you were 20 minutes late to your manicure.
Show 'em your hands.
This can't go on.
She's right.
Yeah. Tell her, Gaby.
According to your sacred rule book,
which, by the way, is a snore fest,
a group of five parents can
seek a vote of no confidence
in a president.
So... I guess we'll be
taking that vote now.
Melissa, Rachel...
You sure you want to do this?
No. It's an obvious bribe.
Well, it worked.
Yeah.
What?
Guess we won't be having
that vote after all.
So what? What more can you do to me?
I already park in the "B" lot.
Nice, mom.
Hello!
Mom. I, uh, I asked you
not to come in here.
I am not staying. I just thought
my little entrepreneurs
could use some lemonade.
So...
This is it, the big internet start-up.
Yes, and for your information,
as soon as we put up the site,
they started selling like crazy.
Over 200 of 'em.
Well, I stand corrected. Good for you.
So how exactly does this
exercise equipment work?
Uh uh well, it kind of incorporates pilates
and stretching.
It's really more for serious athletes.
That might be another order.
I should get that.
But could you take Benjamin
to go get some lunch?
Of course. Benjy.
Hello. X-stasy sex swing.
We put the swing back in your sex life.
Yes, it can support up to 300 pounds.
And we guarantee maximum pleasure
for you and your partner.
Ready?
Is this for me?
Unless you know another Penny Scavo
with an incredibly generous mom.
Look, it even has a camera.
Cool!
But my birthday was last month.
I know, but this way,
when you're at your dad's,
we can video chat,
like, when you need help with homework
or you've been having trouble with math.
No, I haven't.
Well, you might. So... bring it.
Okay?
Hey, sweetie. Long time no see.
Mom, you just dropped me off..
Really? It feels like forever.
The gum you gave me in
the car still has flavor.
Well, I miss you.
Actually, since you called,
we're multiplying mixed fractions,
and I'm kind of...
I know what you mean.
Can you move your head?
Uh, sure.
So do I need a common denominator?
Honey, the sun's creating a glare.
Would you mind turning
your screen just a scooch?
Okay.
Dad's new place looks nice.
Yeah, it is.
Hey! You know what might be fun?
Why don't you give me a tour?
Just turn your tablet
around and scan the room.
Oh, big-screen TV.
There's a 9.0 on the predictability scale.
Empty pizza box, dirty plate, dirty glass.
It's nice he's kept
the same decorating scheme.
My arms are getting tired.
Little longer. Think light thoughts.
Stop. Go back.
I want to see your dad's
new lovely... curtains.
Wow.
They're nice.
But they seem a little young for him.
Who is that?
That's Chloe.
She lives in the building.
She's really nice.
Apparently.
So... is Chloe around a lot?
Sometimes.
She teaches a Booty Burn Ballet class,
so she's mostly at the fitness center.
Hey, Mom. Dad's got black toilets.
You wanna see them?
No, thanks. I've seen enough.
Okay. So when I multiply these fractions...
Okay, sweetie, I love you.
Oh, that's different.
Mm-hmm.
What does this mean to you?
Loneliness, isolation,
not long ago, this tree
was lush and green,
but now it's, uh, lost its leaves,
and winter's ahead.
And it's just doing
what it can to survive.
So let me guess... you're the tree.
Oh, okay.
You're... mocking me again.
Well, good-bye.
Hold on. We're having
an artistic dialogue here.
I bet your night went
something like this...
You went home and asked yourself,
"How do I prove to Andre
Zeller that I'm deep?"
So you dug down through the cupcakes
and the throw pillows
and the once-a-week sex of
your life to your very core,
and you found this sad little tree.
"And it's so profound"
"because the tree's lonely, just like I am"
"now that 'oprah's' off the air."
How dare you.
You don't know anything about me.
What's to know? You're shallow,
and your work is shallow, and god bless,
because if I had your life,
I'd be painting bunnies, too.
You want everything to be nice and pretty.
You're afraid of ugly.
You-you think I'm afraid of ugly?
You want ugly?
There.
There's some ugly for you.
You want passion?
Well, here you go. There's passion.
Passion all over the place.
You know, I am not some
shallow soccer mom.
I have done things that you can't believe.
I have anger!
And I have pain!
I have secrets in me that I wish...
I could get rid of, and I can't!
It's fine. You know, you...
you've made your mind up about me.
So screw your class, screw your medium.
Screw you!
Ah, there you are.
Hey, do you have a recipe for...
Oh. Congratulations.
For what?
Well, I didn't know you and
Chuck were back together.
We're not.
Well, then why are you
wearing a sex swing?
A what?
Oh, no. This is, uh,
Danielle's new business.
She's making exercise equipment.
Uh, yeah,
for a very specific kind of exercise.
Sex swing?
I've never even heard of such a thing.
Now don't try this one
if you get dizzy easily.
Mom?
Exercise equipment?
When I get out of this,
you are in so much trouble!
I'll write you a check later.
A sex swing in my test kitchen?
Do you realize I used to make
people wear hairnets in here?
Danielle, I am very disappointed in you.
Gosh, where have I heard that before?
Oh, don't you try to
turn this around on me!
For the first time in my life,
I found something that
I'm good at and that's successful,
and that's still not good enough for you!
You just live to judge me.
Danielle.
Danielle, where are you going?!
No, I'm telling you. It was bad.
Andre probably called the looney bin,
and they're on their way here
right now with a butterfly net.
It's okay, babe.
No, it's not. I just ran out of there.
I-I-I forgot my portfolio.
I don't know what the hell came over me.
Susan...
I know how badly you want
what happened in the woods to go away,
but I have to tell you the truth.
It's not going to.
It's part of you.
No. N... mnh.
I-I don't want it to be.
I don't want it to be either,
just like I don't want
my dark stuff to be part of me,
but it is.
Mike, please. Please stop saying this.
I'm trying to protect you.
If you can accept this as part of you,
maybe you can figure out
how to live with it.
But if you don't,
that's when it jumps out without warning.
And trust me,
that's a bad way to live.
So...
things are never gonna
be the way they were?
Things...
are how they are.
You okay?
Mommy, will you check my math worksheet?
It's really hard.
Sure. Sure, honey.
In case you're wondering how I got here,
the U.P.S. man heard
my cries and cut me down.
Suffice it to say, we're FedEx people now.
Look, I know you think
that I am judgmental.
Think?
"Danielle, you should've gone to college."
"Danielle, you dress like a streetwalker."
"Danielle, I knew
your marriage wouldn't last."
Yeah, a little bit.
What I was going to say is you're right.
Why are you admitting this?
Because I thought about what you said,
and I realize I am far from perfect.
I have no right to be so critical.
Okay, now you're freaking me out.
Did something happen?
Just know that a certain recent... event
made me aware that I am
in no position to judge you
or anyone else.
What are you talking about?
It doesn't matter.
The point is...
can you forgive me?
Wow.
That's, like, the first
time you've ever said that.
Thank you. And...
yes, I forgive you.
And to prove that I am sincere,
I would like to invest in your business
and support you in making
those disgusting-ly happy swings.
You mean like a silent partner?
A silent, invisible,
and completely untraceable partner
who supports you from far, far away.
I love you, sweetie.
I love you, too.
Now... go pack up your sex factory,
and I will bake us some cookies.
You're about to paint
a hundred bad paintings,
so let's get those out of the way
so you can start painting the good ones.
What are you doing?
Uh, I forgot my portfolio.
Sit down.
Excuse me?
Sit down. You're late.
Does that mean you're
letting me join the class?
For now.
But that woman who showed up
yesterday... the crazy one...
she better be here every single day.
I-I don't know if I like that woman.
She scares me.
Good.
Okay, I want you to start
by forgetting everything
you heard about brush technique.
I've seen your painting.
Either you heard it wrong,
or it was wrong.
Hey. Are you ready for our walk?
Actually, change of plans.
I thought we'd go to that
booty burn ballet class
at the fitness center.
What's going on?
Nothing. Can't a woman
just wanna burn her booty?
Fine. I think you're right
about Tom seeing someone.
She's an aerobics teacher.
Of course she is. Cliche much?
So I'm thinking,
I'll go to her class, and I'll...
Actually, I-I don't know
what the hell I'm thinking.
You're thinking you
wanna spy on this woman
and see what she's like,
then key her car on the way out.
It's perfectly natural.
So I'm not crazy?
I shouldn't just be direct
and ask Tom if he's seeing someone?
Why? So he can lie to you
through his unnaturally white teeth?
Okay, then.
I guess we're going.
Yeah. Uh, booty burn ballet...
think we can do this?
Oh, please. How hard can it be?
Am I the only one about to pass out?
No. I keep seeing my dead grandfather
at the end of the tunnel,
saying "Come toward the light."
Keep going, ladies.
Keep your eyes on the thighs!
Did she just use a civil
rights rallying cry
to get us to lose ass fat?
First time, huh?
Oh, what gave me away?
The fact that this was
light blue when I came in?
Well, the good news is
if you have a heart attack, I'm a doctor.
The bad news is if you have one, I'm not.
Okay, so if I die,
please put me ass up in the coffin.
I'd hate for all this work to go to waste.
On your feet, ladies.
Okay, we've checked out the competition.
Can we go now?
No.
I want to talk to her.
Okay, everybody,
time to work those quads.
I don't know who I hate
more right now... you or her.
50 lunges!
Jump towards your skinny, skinny future.
And we have a winner.
Hi. It's Mrs. Solis.
Can you tell Sean I'm running
about 20 minutes late
for my brow-waxing appointment?
What? You can't hold it for me?
But I've got caterpillars over my eyes.
Fine. I'll be there in five minutes.
Juanita, get back in the car.
We're going drop-off.
Gaby, what are you doin'?
You can't be in the carpool
lane without a placard.
Don't give a crap. It's time
somebody taught Dana a lesson.
We need to break
the back of our oppressor.
Mobilize the cones!
Get out, sweetie. Go. Go. Go, go, go!
I'm never gonna get that eyebrow wax.
Again, Dana, I am so sorry.
On the upside, that cast is so slimming.
It's like a hard spanx.
Gaby, there's a reason I asked to see you.
You wanted to give me my placard back.
No. Could you hand me those painkillers?
I just wanted to bring you up to date
on some school-related news.
Given my condition,
they've informed me
that I'm no longer able
to carry out my duties
as P.T.A. president.
That's a bummer.
Yes, it is.
The bylaws state I'm to
appoint an acting president,
and I've made my decision.
Me?
Wait. You hate me.
Very perceptive.
That'll serve you well
as P.T.A. president.
W... okay, wait.
Why are you doing this?
Let me tell you what I was
like before I took this job.
I was fun.
I drank at school functions.
My boob fell out at the holiday party.
I still had a husband.
So what turned you into this?
The job did. Mm-hmm.
And it's gonna do the same to you.
Yeah, no time for manicures
'cause you'll be planning the winter gala.
No more seeing your husband
because you'll be
organizing the bake sale.
And no more friends,
because you'll always be
hitting them up for something.
Well, as attractive as your
little revenge fantasy sounds,
I'm gonna pass.
Then I guess I'm gonna have
to go ahead and press charges.
What are you talking about?
It was an accident.
I have witnesses
who heard you say you were
going to break my back.
And I do have a broken back.
So the winter gala...
it's in the winter, right?
That's interesting. Interesting.
So really, you have three careers.
You're a aerobics instructor,
aromatherapist,
and a lingerie model.
Well, lingerie modeling is
more of a hobby than a career.
Oh. But when god gives you these...
Right.
Are you sure god gave you those?
I'm just kidding.
I'm just kidding.
It's nice talking to you, Chloe.
Ready to go?
Yes.
So?
Well, obviously, I'm not thrilled.
Look at her.
But it could be worse.
How?
She could look like that
and have a single thought in her head.
I mean, there's no way Tom's
ever gonna get serious
about a woman like that, right?
Yeah. She's just a fling.
Mm.
A palate cleanser.
The sorbet you eat between courses.
I'm really sorry I said that.
I give the whole thing three weeks.
Lynette?
Hey! Tom. What's-what's going on?
I'll meet you at the car.
Okay.
Wh-what are you doing here?
I know.
Know what?
Wh...
Okay.
We just had dinner a couple of times.
There's nothing going on.
Whatever.
So this is how you're gonna be
spending your free time now,
spying on me?
Well, that's a brilliant strategy, Tom.
Act like I'm the one in the wrong.
You're the one dating the underwear model.
What are you talking about?
Chloe? I'm not dating Chloe.
Jeez, Lynette, give me a little credit.
Then you have you been having
dinner with? Why are you here?
I am picking up Jane, Chloe's mom.
Like I said, it's just
a couple of dinners and coffee.
Oh, it's coffee now?
God, Tom, when were you
gonna tell me this?
Thursday, in counseling.
You ready to go?
Yeah.
Lynette, we'll talk about
this thursday, right?
What's the point?
Yes, we often learn
our most important lessons
outside the classroom...
The painful truth about
the state of a relationship...
the ugly cost of challenging authority...
the sad fact that life's
colors aren't always rosy...
Then there are those
who refuse to accept
these important lessons.
They simply wait for the chance
to teach a lesson of their own.
Don't tell me you're still
stewing about that redhead.
Well, I'm not a big fan of getting led on
and humiliated, so, yeah, I'm not...
Don't think I'm letting
go of this one yet.
Suit yourself.
I got some missing person
reports here for you.
Just toss 'em over there.

Previously on Desperate Housewives...
After an incident at school...
Aah!
Gaby was forced to replace
the P.T.A. President.
Me?
Carlos was struggling
with his guilt.
This is not me. I can't sleep.
I'm seeing ghosts.
I know.
Susan found a way to cope.
I'm taking a painting class
being taught by Andre Zeller.
Great.
But the famous painter
didn't make it easy.
You're a bored housewife
trying to kill time
between spin class and driving
your kid to soccer practice.
And Lynette discovered
that since their separation,
Tom had started dating.
It's just a couple of dinners
and... coffee.
God, Tom. When were you
gonna tell me this?
In their 20 years together,
Tom and Lynette Scavo had
followed a few simple rules...
Always share the housework...
Never waste the hot water,
and never, ever
go to bed angry.
Yes, the rules
for being together were simple.
But the rules
for being apart...
Were anything but.
Stop calling it "dating."
It's dinner with a friend.
Do not do that.
Do not do the snort.
Could you make her stop
snorting?
Lynette,
I find it more effective
when we use words rather than
inflammatory noises.
You want words?
Here are some words.
Liar, liar, pants on fire.
Lobster for two at Chez Nous
is not "dinner with a friend."
A $300 night at Sakura
is not strapping on a feedbag
with a buddy.
I still do
our credit card bills, genius.
All right, enough words.
Hey, it's not like
I went looking for this.
Jane lives in the building.
We got to talking.
You know what?
She was actually nice to me...
something I'm not used to.
Oh, I can't snort,
but a drive-by like that's okay?
All right, emotions are running
a little hot,
but I think I know why.
You two embarked
on this separation
without a clear goal in mind.
Are you trying
to get back together,
or are you trying to find
a graceful way
to end the marriage?
We don't have to decide this
right now,
but we do need to lay down
some ground rules.
For example, are you dating?
He is.
Two dinners.
All right,
so you are dating.
What about sex?
No.
Not yet.
I-I...
He just answered
your first question.
He wants to end the marriage.
No, Lynette,
that's not what I'm saying.
I'm not giving up.
"Not yet"?
Look, I still hope that we can
find a way to work things out,
but...
We don't
make each other happy.
We haven't for a long time.
So what if... I mean,
what if there was
someone out there who could?
I just feel like
if we don't...
Explore...
Then we are gonna end up right
back in here, on this couch,
hating each other.
Sounds like you have a lot
to consider.
There's nothing to consider.
We're... cleared for sex.
Let the dating begin.
Yes, Tom and Lynette
were learning
the rules of separation.
And the first rule?
And I can't wait
to let my new boyfriend
do that thing
I never let you do.
There are no rules.
Desperate Housewives 8x05
The Art of Making Art
-DIFUNDE LA PALABRA-
In any group,
there are roles that people
are destined to play...
the perfect homemaker
to bring the snacks,
the financial wizard
to keep the books...
And the busybody
to share the gossip.
But sometimes
the most important role of all
goes to someone
who's not the slightest bit
prepared for it.
Hi, guys. I know,
I'm a little bit late.
A little? Try 45 minutes.
Well, once you hear
what I've been through,
you will totally understand.
So... you know how it's called
a hot stone massage?
So there I am at the spa,
laid out with my mojito,
my "Marie Claire,"
and all of a sudden,
I feel a cold rock on my ass.
I know!
So Armando was all apologetic.
He wanted to reheat the rocks.
But at this point, I'm like,
"I'm sorry. I've got
a P.T.A. Meeting to run."
If you left, why are you late?
Oh, Armando felt so bad,
he gave me a complimentary
seaweed wrap.
So... what's on the agenda here?
We're supposed to plan
teacher appreciation night.
Mm. Right, right.
So who's doing what for that?
Cindy, you wanna handle
the food?
No.
Okay.
Rachel, you never stop talking.
You wanna emcee?
No.
Okay, what's going on here?
What's going on is
you've wasted our time.
I'm leaving.
I have to pick up my kids.
I have to get back to my job.
I need to take my mother
to chemo.
Wh... okay, okay. Let's not play
sad-life poker here.
I need your help.
You know, we would love
to fritter away our days
with manicures and hairdressers
and spa appointments,
but we're not like you.
We have lives.
So you can do
teacher appreciation night
on your own.
Wh...
Well, could you at least
fold up your chairs
and Stack 'em
on the rolling cart?
And can someone empty
the coffeepot?
You'd really do...
Jeez! Talk about selfish.
Oh, thank goodness.
You're alive.
I'm sorry, reverend.
I know that I haven't been
to church for a few Sundays.
A few? Try five.
You know who's been bringing
snacks to fellowship hour?
Helen Johnson.
Ugh. Let me guess.
Bran muffins
from the mini-mart?
Why hast thou forsaken me?
I should've called you.
It's just,
I haven't been feeling...
Very spiritual lately.
It's not uncommon for us
to lose our way spiritually
from time to time,
to feel...
In the woods.
Interesting choice of words.
It's just that I...
Feel like maybe
I'm not worthy of...
God's love right now,
that...
I've lost my connection
to him.
But here's the good thing
about God, Bree...
he's easy to find.
Just seek out the people who are
in need, and there he is.
It always comes back to
the needy with you, doesn't it?
It's kind of in
the job description.
I hear your new neighbor
Ben Faulkner
does wonderful work
with the homeless.
Why don't you speak to him?
Perhaps I will.
Thank you, reverend.
I did mention that
Helen's doing the snacks, right?
Ah.
I just finished a batch
of macadamia nut scones.
Would you like one?
Bless you, my child.
And maybe one for the car?
I get so nervous every time
I walk into this class.
I mean, Andre Zeller, right?
Between you and me,
he doesn't think
I'm a serious artist.
But I'll show him.
I have pain.
I mean, like this morning,
my 9-year-old walked
right into school
without even saying good-bye.
No hug, no kiss.
Nothing.
Well, I'm gonna take that misery
and use it in my art.
I'm using
my father's suicide.
Today we'll be working
with light and shadow.
Ooh! Eggs. Cool.
Ms. Delfino,
this is my breakfast.
You will not be sketching eggs
or any other
hackneyed still lifes today.
You'll be drawing the male form.
Emile.
Whoa!
Sorry.
Takes some... getting used to.
As you begin to sketch,
think of the human form
as an object.
What is it
that catches your eye?
Mm.
Didn't mean it. Just popped out.
I want you
to pay close attention
to which parts of the human body
reflect light
and which parts cast a shadow.
I'm sorry, Ms. Delfino.
I didn't realize
we were in junior high.
Have you never seen a penis
before?
No. No. Yes, I have.
Uh, lots. Well, not lots.
The appropriate... amount.
Please try to be professional.
I am. I am professional.
Penis, penis, penis.
Just trying to take the power
out of it.
Quick.
Tell me about
your father's suicide.
Hey. What are you doing?
Uh...
I was, uh, looking
for my phone,
and, uh...
I know this is gonna sound
stupid, but...
I couldn't go in there.
Oh, God. I don't mean
to sound insensitive,
but is this dead guy angst?
'Cause I am really pooped
right now.
It's just, every time
I go into that room,
I think about that night.
Well, here's an idea.
Don't go in that room.
Look, there's the kitchen.
No one died in there.
You know what?
We're both stressed.
I'll pour us
a couple of drinks.
No, thanks. I've been hitting
that stuff pretty hard lately.
I don't want it to become a thing.
Well, after the day I had,
I'll finish the bottle myself.
This P.T.A. Gig is turning into
a serious pain in the ass.
Yeah.
I show up
the teensiest bit late,
and the girls are all over me.
They're like,
"Gaby, why are you late?
You should be sad and miserable
and on time, just like us."
It's like they're jealous
or something.
Oh, my God.
They're jealous.
I know what to do.
Thanks for listening.
It's nothing fancy,
but, uh, I'm proud to say
we feed hundreds
of homeless people every day.
Oh. Wonderful.
This is exactly what
I'm looking for.
Well, great.
But, uh,
just out of curiosity...
Uh, what did you do?
Excuse me?
Well, when most people
wanna give back,
it usually means
they've done something
they're, uh, ashamed of.
You know, embezzlement,
adultery.
What's your story?
I suppose I could ask you
the same thing.
And I'd have the good sense
not to answer.
Mm-hmm.
I've just been feeling
disconnected lately,
and I thought by doing something
meaningful with my days
that I could change that.
Actual selflessness.
That's refreshing.
I wish the city council was
as enlightened as you.
Oh?
Ah, they're holding up
one of my developments
'cause it includes
low-income housing.
Ah. Typical
"not in my backyard" attitude.
By the way...
It's not in your backyard.
Uh, I'm gonna have to take this.
But, uh, I will leave you
in the capable hands
of, uh, Donnie here.
Excuse me. Hello?
Who are you?
Oh, I am Bree,
your humble sous chef.
What do you need me to do?
Prep? Saute? Chop?
You wanna prep?
Start prepping.
That's... it?
Oh, I forgot to show you
the spice rack.
Here you go. Salt. Pepper.
And we're out of pepper.
If I may,
have you ever considered
making the soup from scratch?
We don't have time
for that.
Just get 'em in
and get 'em out.
Yes, because we all know
how pressed for time
the homeless are.
Look, these people
may not have homes,
but they do have taste buds.
Would you be offended
if I tried whipping up a batch
of homemade soup?
Can you get it done by noon?
Oh, dear. I guess
I'll have to keep it simple.
It's just a rustic
acorn squash bisque
finished with a dot
of maple-infused creme fraiche
and a little crumble
of fried sage.
Holy crap!
Finally, a blurb
for my next cookbook.
I understand that some of you
are uncomfortable
with the naked body,
maybe even find it laughable.
Mr. Zeller, I'm so sorry.
One cannot create real art
if one is crippled
by one's own inhibitions.
I'm gonna strip them away.
So... for our next class, we're
not gonna have nude models.
Phew.
We're gonna have nude painters.
What?
Painting in the nude
will force you
to create from a place
of total honesty.
And if you're serious
about being an artist,
you shouldn't have
a problem with it.
Nope.
No problem at all.
What's going on, Gaby?
Yeah. Why'd you
call us here?
I just want to apologize
for what happened
at the last meeting.
Keep talkin'.
It was wrong of me to blow
you off for a spa appointment
when you have such busy lives.
Message received,
loud and clear.
Thank you.
So to show you I've taken
your complaint to heart,
may I present my beauty team!
Armando,
the best masseuse in town,
Kay, my hairdresser,
and Ping on nails.
You no longer have to be jealous
of my fabulous life.
For one day, you can be me.
My treat. Go crazy.
Wow. Good to know
you got our message.
You're welcome.
So you think you might want
to reconsider doing the food?
I'd love to.
Uh, I'll handle decorations.
Yeah, whatever you need
from us.
That's more like it.
Now today, relax.
Take a break from
grocery shopping and spanking.
I have to go meet
my travel agent.
Are you guys serious?
Are we really helping her?
No. We're helping ourselves
to a free spa day,
then we're going to leave her
twisting in the wind.
Oh! Hey, ladies,
anyone know of a good hotel
in the south of France?
I'm sorry.
I did it again!
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Hey, Lynette,
did I leave
those fabric samples?
Busted!
That is a porn slam
if I've ever seen one.
Porn?
Mm.
No.
I was checking my e-mail.
Come on. It's okay.
We all look at porn.
What are you into?
Straight, bi, solo,
bald guys,
fuzzy whispers,
cinnamon cakes,
poodling?
Do I have to learn
what those are?
'Cause I really
don't want to know.
Oh, come on. Let me see.
I promise I will not judge.
No. I signed up
for an online dating service,
and I took a stab
at my introduction video.
Hi, I'm Lynette.
I'm 35 to 45-ish.
I'm a cancer,
and I beat cancer.
Coincidence or not? You decide.
That is more disturbing
than any porn
I've ever seen.
You said you wouldn't judge.
Oh! Online dating sucks.
It's full of guys who Photoshop
hair on their heads
and crop out their man boobs.
You want to meet men?
I'm taking you to a bar.
A bar? Oh, I don't know.
It's been 25 years since
I tried to pick up a guy.
Well, with me as your wingwoman,
you can have any man you want.
Friday okay?
I thought you had a date
with Ben.
Mm. He canceled. Again.
Some stupid real estate
development for the poor.
Bastard.
Well, his loss.
If he doesn't appreciate
what he's got,
I will find someone
who does.
Oh, and lay off
the ice cream.
There's no Photoshop
in real life.
Morning.
What's for breakfast?
Eggs. I was gonna make bacon,
but it seemed a little risky.
Susan, you get upset if I take
my socks off in the kitchen.
What's going on?
Andre feels "until we shed
our inhibitions,
our art will be
only superficial."
Anyway,
for our next class,
we have to paint in the nude.
So I'm trying
to get used to it.
And I want to prove to him
that I can be a real artist.
Wow, that guy is good.
He gets to see a bunch of coeds
naked and call it work.
Oh, honey, I'm kidding.
No, I can't do it.
I'm not a naked person.
Maybe I'm not a real artist
either.
Susan.
No, I mean it.
Andre doesn't like
any of my work.
I'm not serious
like the other students.
I think I'm just gonna quit
the class.
Quit? But this class has been
really good for you.
It seems like
it was pulling you
out of that dark place
you've been in.
You think so?
Yeah, and I feel like
I'm getting my old Susie back.
Besides, this guy
sounds like a jackass.
Don't let him win.
You're right.
I am a serious artist.
I just need to get used to
people seeing me naked.
Susan!
It's Lee. You home?
Perfect. My best gay.
Who better to practice on?
Good morning, Lee.
This is Bob's... mother of God!
Ohh!
Gay marriage doesn't seem
so freaky now, does it?
Looks like my tuscan bean with
parmesan crostini is a hit.
Yeah, it is,
but I think you're starting
to attract
the wrong sort of crowd.
Excuse me, but, uh, you don't
exactly look homeless to me.
Yeah, I-I'm homeless.
And yet you have
a $2,000 laptop?
But I live ithe box
it came in?
Okay, I-I'm a college student.
But my parents
did stop talking to me
when I switched from pre-med
to creative writing.
Well, I'm afraid
you're gonna have to leave.
Too bad. I just gave you
mad props on my blog.
Is that a good thing?
Yeah.
"Homey but refined,
"Bree Van de Camp's
tuscan bean soup
is a revelation in a bowl."
Revelation, you say?
Uh-huh. And it's already
been "liked" on Facebook
and retweeted 200 times...
Which is also a good thing.
Oh.
But hey, if I gotta go...
Hold on.
I can't let a talented
near-orphan like you go hungry.
Let me get you a refill.
Oh, and it's "Van de Kamp"...
With a "k."
Hey, Mike. Need a hand?
No, I'm okay.
Uh, Susan around?
Uh, she's
at her painting class.
Okay.
I'll... stop by later.
I don't think
that's a good idea.
You need to say
something to me, Mike?
Yeah, I do.
If things were different,
if it had been me
that killed somebody,
and your wife walked in,
I'd have gone to the cops
and turned myself in.
I wouldn't have
dragged Gaby into it.
There's a lot I would've done
differently about that night
if I could.
Yeah, well, you can't.
But here's what you can do...
you can leave Susan alone.
Just let her find a way to deal
with what you put her through.
It just really helps
to talk to her.
But it doesn't help her.
Then...
I won't do it anymore.
Yeah.
Remember,
technique is a crutch.
Learn it and throw it away.
That way you can begin
to find your own voice
and that's what that...
Oh, my God.
Oh!
Taking casual Friday
a bit to the extreme,
aren't we, Ms. Delfino?
Isn't this the day we were...
Aren't we all supposed to be...
The school put the kibosh on
my little artistic experiment.
It was all there
in the e-mail.
What e-mail?
The one
you obviously didn't open.
Maybe you didn't send me one.
Why would I do that?
To humiliate me.
To punish me for laughing.
You have singled me out
since day one.
Why not try
to make a fool of me?
Because in the vast landscape
of my interior life,
you're merely a dust speck.
Now get dressed and sit down.
No.
I signed up for this class
to learn something,
not to be a punching bag
for an egomaniac
with a paintbrush!
I quit!
Hello and welcome
to our soup kitchen.
I hope you're hungry,
because I have prepared
a hearty Italian wedding soup
today.
Donnie, two.
Reverend Sykes.
What a nice surprise!
That's quite a crowd
out front.
I practically
had to fight my way in.
Well, ever since
I took over the kitchen,
we've been jam-packed.
Thank you so much
for suggesting I get involved.
I have never felt more needed
or important in my whole life.
The intention of charity is not
to make us feel important.
Of course not.
It's to help people.
Feeling important's
just a bonus.
So what brings you by?
I was hoping you could tell me
where a homeless person
could get a hot meal.
Well, right here, of course.
No, Bree.
Ever since you've turned
this soup kitchen
into a bisque kitchen,
the homeless don't
feel comfortable here.
Why? I was just trying
to make this place special.
It was already special.
It was home for them,
until you took that away.
Excuse me.
I'm sorry, but you're
gonna need to leave.
Hey, we're still eating.
Well, then go eat
somewhere else.
You certainly look like
you can afford to.
Whoa. Where's the attitude
coming from?
We made is place a success.
No. This place is supposed
to feed homeless people.
It's a dismal failure.
This food isn't for you. It's
for the hungry and the poor...
the people we walk past
every day.
Everyone deserves
to have a place,
and this place was theirs
until I made it mine.
So please, pack up your laptops
and your smartphones and go.
Please go.
Ben, I'm sorry. I have made
a terrible mess of things.
Don't worry about it.
You think you can make a speech
that good again tomorrow?
Speech?
You're gonna help me push
that low-income housing project
through city council.
This is where you live, huh?
Norman Rockwell would
walk down this street
and say, "a little much."
Can I come in?
Of course. How else are
you gonna make fun
of the inside of my house?
By the way, I, uh,
checked my e-mail,
and, uh, you never sent me one.
Did you check
your campus e-mail?
I have a campus e-mail?
Okay,
I'm gonna make this brief,
mainly because I've got
a dinner engagement
with someone infinitely
more interesting than you.
Wow.
Climb down from your cross
and come back to my class.
Why?
So you can abuse me more?
Yes, I will abuse you
and scream at you,
make you paint in the nude
and do anything else
I have to do to get you
to stop being so scared.
I'm not scared.
I showed up
at your class naked.
Then you ran away.
It seems to me you do
a lot of running away
and nervous giggling.
Mm.
You act like
someone who's...
What?
You're hiding something,
and I'm gonna pull it
out of you,
and when that happens,
there is a chance...
the remotest, slimmest wisp
of a chance...
that you might actually
become an artist.
Oh, God. Is this the part
where you tell me
that the reason
you're being so hard on me
is because I'm the only one
in the class with potential.
No.
Amy Yamata's the only one
in the class with potential.
You're a bizarre car crash
that somehow fascinates me.
Thank you?
Now if you'll excuse me,
this is about
as long as I can spend
in a room decorated
with ceramic elephants.
Hi, ladies. Someone wanna
help me with these flowers?
Okay, no worries. I got it.
What have you guys been doing?
People are gonna be here in two
hours. Nothing's been set up.
Well, I'm just so relaxed
from that massage.
I'd hate to lift something
and tense up again.
Yeah, and... and Ping worked
so hard on these nails.
I would hate to chip them.
And I... can't think
of anything witty to say
about my fabulous new 'do,
but I'm not doing squat either.
Why are you doing this to me?
I went out of my way
to help you people.
Oh, my God,
you are so out of touch.
Do you really think
a hot stone massage
is gonna solve my problems?
You don't understand the kinds
of things real people deal with.
You live in this perfect
little fairy tale.
Fine. I don't need your help.
I have two hours
and a very capable husband.
This event is going off
without a hitch.
Oh, and one more thing.
Hello?
Honey, sorry to bother you
at work,
but this is an emergency.
Whoa. What's going on?
I need you to meet me
at the school.
These P.T.A. Beeyotches...
yeah, I'm talking to you,
Cindy...
Are refusing to help me.
I need an extra pair of hands.
Sure.
I'll be... be right there.
Ha! He's on his way.
Thanks. You're a lifesaver.
Wow. When I pictured this
in my head,
I wasn't as old
as all the other people...
Combined.
Uh, two martinis, dirty.
Oh, wait. That's me.
Feel free to use that
if you want.
Maybe I will... at home,
'cause that's where I'm going.
Oh, relax.
Look at this place
like a candy store.
You just have to figure out
what you're in the mood for.
Obviously,
something with nuts.
I thought
I was done with this.
I dated, I combed through
all the losers,
and I finally found a guy,
someone who was smart
and made me laugh.
And now to be back here,
at my age,
doing it all over again,
it's depressing.
Oh, my God. You're right.
What?
It is depressing.
Renee.
What am I doing
in hell's candy store?
I have a guy. He's smart
and he makes me laugh.
I thought you said
Ben works too much.
Oh, he's passionate
about his job, but he's a 10.
You add up every guy
in this place and you get a 6.
But you stay. There's definitely
somebody here for you.
Orange cable...
Goes around here...
This one goes here.
Ha! And...
Presto!
Oh!
Ow.
So is "presto" Spanish
for "cover your ears"?
That's hilarious, Cindy.
You know,
you should've been a comic
instead of a pint-sized
pain in my ass!
Oh, it's getting late.
Looks like
your perfect husband
isn't gonna be here
to bail you out.
Aha! Look who's here.
There's my hero!
Now hurry up.
We need to get cracking here.
Hey, what are you doing?
Carlos.
Hey, Gaby.
Carlos, you can't be
here like this. You've gotta go.
No, no, no.
Gonna help, okay?
No. Please.
You need to leave.
No, I'm gonna help, okay?
Gonna help.
No, honey.
You have to leave, please.
Hang on. Hang on.
Whew!
Rachel, get the soundboard
set up.
Melissa, Megan,
start putting out the food.
Melissa, now.
It's okay, Gaby.
We got it.
I don't know what to say.
Just take care
of your husband.
Hello.
I'm Phil,
and you're beautiful.
You're just saying that.
But I'll take it.
God knows it took me long enough
to get ready tonight.
I even had to pay the sitter
to come early.
Sitter? So you have kids?
Yeah.
Five. Five kids.
Wow. That sounds like a lot.
I actually have a husband, too,
but we're separated,
and we're seeing other people.
Or he is, and I'm trying to.
Not that I'm doing it
to retaliate, it's just that...
wow. I can't seem
to stop talking.
Maybe you could
say something now.
Bye.
Bye-bye.
Crowd's a little light tonight,
don't you think?
Can I buy you a drink
or are you already lit?
Oh, come on. I'll let you
play with my tie.
Here's the remote.
Don't I know you
from somewhere?
Okay.
Not the most original line,
but you're cute, so...
Lynette.
Right. Right. You're Porter
and Preston's mom.
Oh, God.
Mrs. Scavo was
the coolest mom.
She used to make us
grilled cheese
in the shape of dinosaurs.
So what are you doing here?
I have no idea.
Here you go.
It's probably the only set
of keys with a purple lanyard.
My kid made it at camp.
Look, I'm wearing something
called skinny jeans,
which are very painful
because I don't have something
called skinny legs,
so I just wanna go home
and peel them off. Do you mind?
No, not at all. I just...
I don't... I don't work here.
Oh.
Oh, God. I'm sorry.
You're not the valet.
I knew this vest
was a bad idea,
but the gay guy in my office
told me they're back.
No, the vest is great.
I have it in navy.
It's just... I haven't been out
in so long,
I figured I'd try
to mix things up.
You haven't been out
in so long?
Last time I was at a bar
like this,
beeper numbers
were exchanged.
I didn't even know
they banned smoking in bars.
And how did the good, old,
reliable Martini lose its job?
Apple? Cherry? Watermelon?
Those are slushie flavors.
I'm Lynette.
Scott.
By the way, not that
it's a competition,
but I have two lanyards
on my keychain.
They're pink.
Daughters?
Yes.
Divorce?
No, thanks.
I already had one.
You?
Uh, separated.
Hey.
Um...
Listen, this is the first decent
conversation I've had all night.
What do you say we go back
inside and continue it?
I say...
Pomegranatinis are on me.
All right. That was easy.
You calling me easy?
Not yet.
Um, please.
Ah.
Uh, can I get you
something to drink?
I have, uh, vodka.
I have milk.
I have chocolate milk.
I have juice boxes.
Having kids has really
ruined my game, huh?
Vodka and chocolate milk...
that's exactly what I give
my baby to calm her down.
Cheers.
Cheers.
Now what do we do?
I'd put on some music,
but my ex got all my cds.
Mm.
I could turn on a black light,
but I'm not 16.
Maybe I could light
some candles,
but that seems like kind of
an obvious move, right?
Not as obvious as this.
Maybe obvious isn't so bad.
Ohh.
Oh, wow!
No?
No. Oh, no, it's good.
It's good. Keep going.
Mmm. Mmm.
I have another room
that I would love to show you.
Really?
Uh-huh.
You're getting... better
at this.
Mmm.
Ow.
Oh! Hang on. Hang on.
Shoot!
Oh. Right here?
Okay.
No, I... dropped something.
Oh. Can I help?
My ring fell off. You had
to have shag carpeting, huh?
Ugh. That gay guy at my office
said shag was back.
Really need to start getting
my style tips from someone else.
Damn it. Where is it?
This rug...
it swallows everything.
There used to be an
end table here and...
Oh, my God! Please don't
be funny right now.
Wait. Wait. Wait.
Here it is.
Oh.
Thank you.
So, uh, where were we?
I'm sorry. I can't.
You're a really great guy.
You're nice and you're funny
and...
Whatever you were doing...
To... to my neck
was really working for me,
but the idea of walking 10 feet
into your bedroom
is about the scariest thing
I can think of right now.
Okay.
I'm...
Hoping to work things out
with my husband,
and I guess I just...
I get it.
You're not there yet.
I'm not.
Well, I think I should go.
Come on.
Bye.
I understand your hesitation.
I am one of those people
with a manicured lawn
who would object
when a proposal like this
threatens her community.
But my eyes have been opened,
and I will personally
go door-to-door
to help other people see
how essential this project is,
so that where we live
can truly be called a community.
You were amazing.
Well, I meant every word.
I want to help you
any way I can.
Great. Well, uh,
first thing tomorrow,
I'll take you out to see
the construction site.
Yes, we may think
we're all destined
to play certain roles.
But sometimes those roles
can unexpectedly change.
A nervous student may discover
a hidden confidence.
A longtime wife may confront
a harsh new reality.
A busy mother
may find her attention
is needed elsewhere.
And a woman who wanted
to do a little bit of good
may find herself playing
a much bigger role
than she intended.
I was searching and searching
for the perfect spot,
and then I found it...
Chapman woods.
Have you ever been here
before?
Once.
Well, they're finally gonna
break ground on Tuesday,
and it's all thanks to you.
Glad I could help.
-DIFUNDE LA PALABRA-
In therapy, the subject
was Tom's new girlfriend.
What about sex?
Not yet.
I... he wants to end the marriage.
Susan wanted to quit...
Maybe I'm not a real artist.
This class has been really good for you.
But decided to face the challenge instead.
You're hiding something,
and I'm gonna pull it out of you.
There is a chance that you might
actually become an artist.
Carlos tried to drown his guilt...
Carlos!
Hey, Gaby.
And Ben showed Bree the
site where construction
was about to begin.
Have you ever been here before?
Once.

Paranoia...
It's the irrational fear
that someone is after you...
That you're going to be
exposed at any moment.
Paranoia can sneak up on you...
Causing you to stumble at every turn.
And just when you think
you're in the clear...
And the danger has passed...
Paranoia reminds you...
Gaby?
Lynette?
That no place is truly safe.
Oh, my God.
Where'd he go?
Is he gone?
For now, but we gotta hurry.
I think we're close. I recognize this area.
God, this is creeping me out.
Well, it doesn't help that it's Halloween.
Let's just dig him up
and get this over with.
Ladies?
Ladies!
Bree?
Bree?
Honey? Are you okay?
Paranoia--
it's the irrational fear
that someone is after you.
But even when you hope it isn't real,
it can still scare you to death.
No!
Susan Delfino had always
been a great student.
That's because she knew how
to be the teacher's pet.
Some liked gifts.
Some liked extra credit.
And some just liked her.
But in her new class,
Susan would learn that not every teacher...
Happy Halloween.
Was in the market for a pet.
I thought you might like a little treat
complete with candy corn.
Who doesn't like candy corn?
Apparently you.
It appears some of you have remembered
today is the day I select my intern.
Oh, is that today?
I have a commission due Tuesday,
and I need all the help
I can get this weekend.
Now this is obviously a prestigious honor.
That goes without saying.
And it won't be awarded
based on brownnosing,
bootlicking or cupcake making.
That about covers all your moves.
My decision will be made solely on talent,
experience, and who irritates me the least.
Oh, crap.
And that's why--
Stand up, Amy.
I've chosen...
Susan Delfino.
Sit down, Amy.
That was fun.
Me?
Meet me at 5:00 tomorrow.
We'll discuss your duties.
Thank you so much. I-I'm so grateful.
But could we make it 5:15?
My son has soccer practice--
I have no kids.
And he's not very good
so he won't be going.
See you at 5:00.
Hey, babe. How you doing?
Fine.
Good.
Great.
Glad to hear it.
Would you like your own cup?
Sorry.
Just...
That night really scared
the hell out of me.
Scared me, too.
Yeah, but you haven't
done anything about it.
I thought you were gonna check out
an A.A. meeting.
Gaby, I'm not an alcoholic.
Tell that to the cab driver who helped me
carry you inside the house.
Fine. If it will keep your
fingers out of my coffee,
I'll go to a meeting.
Thank you.
I love you.
We're gonna get through this, okay?
Oh! And do me a favor.
If it turns out you are an alcoholic,
promise you won't be one
of those whiny ones.
Okay, we gotta talk.
Oh, God, he brought Jane?
Hey, sweetie. How was your dad's?
It was fun.
Good.
Look. It's my Halloween costume.
I'm gonna be a swan.
Right. How about you be something
mommy can actually make, like a ghost
or a 13-year-old American teenager?
You don't have to make it.
Jane said she would.
Of course she did.
Well, I should go thank her
for helping me to parent you.
Jane, it's okay.
You don't have to stay in the car.
Or maybe you should.
I mean, I don't wanna show
you up with my fancy sweats.
Oh, stop. You look great.
Look, I think it's sweet
that you volunteered
to help Penny make her costume.
Hey, I hope I didn't overstep.
You know, it's just, before medical school,
I dabbled a bit in fashion design.
Of course you did. It's nothing.
Couple of semesters in Paris.
Ah, Paris. C'est la plus
belle ville du monde, no?
Oui. Oui, oui. Yes.
She's- she's teaching me.
Of course she is.
Anyway, making Penny's Halloween costume
is sort of a... mother/daughter tradition.
Since when?
Since always.
Actually, I started it already,
and I don't want to oversell,
but it's gonna be pretty great.
I'm sorry. She didn't say anything.
I'm sure she didn't want
to hurt your feelings.
Well, if you change your mind,
it's really no trouble.
I've already made a bunch of costumes
for the kids in the cancer ward.
Of course she did.
Oh, God. You're closing the curtains.
This can't be good.
It isn't. I just heard the details
of Ben's latest real estate project.
Mom!
Oh, honey, not right now.
We're talking.
You told me to try on my costume.
You said you'd fix the yolk.
Oh, this is will take two seconds.
Celia's going as bacon.
This works a lot better
when we're together.
So what were you guys talking about?
Um, I was just telling your mother
a very scary Halloween story
about these four witches
who buried a monster deep in the woods.
Cool.
And after they buried the monster,
they went on with their lives
until this big, frightening real
estate developer came along
and decided to build condos
right where the monster was buried!
Ow! Oh! Sorry, sorry.
Are you sure?
Yeah. Witches always lie.
Not this witch.
Ha.
Well, I think one of those witches
better go see what she can
do to kill the project.
How?!
I don't know. It's your story.
Fine.
Yeah. That actually was
kind of a lame story.
It wasn't even scary.
Trust me, honey.
It is really, really scary.
Hi.
Sorry I've been A.W.O.L.
for the past t two week,
but, uh, that's only 'cause I--
I'm sorry. Have we met? Ben, is it?
I know, I know. I...
I've been swamped getting
my new project under way.
But I wanna make it up to you.
How?
Tomorrow night, my place, dinner for two,
cooked by one.
Tomorrow's Halloween.
So? It'll be fun.
We can, uh, pass out candy
to trick-or-treaters.
And then maybe later,
we can... trick a little... treat of our...
I don't know where I was going with that.
All right, you want a date with me?
Yeah.
Beg.
Excuse me?
On your knees, soldier.
Renee, dear, sweet, horrible girl,
would you do me the honor of dining with me
on the morrow?
I would.
Was that really necessary?
It was for me.
I had to make sure I wasn't rolling over
for a guy with a bald spot.
Intern Susan Delfino
reporting for duty, sir.
I was wondering how long it
might take me to regret this.
Wait. I just want to say how honored I am
that you chose me.
It's nice to know that when the
history of art is written,
there'll be one small
footnote with my name on it.
Susan, Jasper, Jasper, Susan.
I'll pick him up Monday night.
I don't understand.
Well, he's my son.
You're watching him for the weekend.
My ex says he's deathly
allergic to tree nuts, cats...
And something else. I can't remember.
Uh, wait a- wait a minute.
So... you have a son? Somebody married you?
Briefly. I was young and needed money.
She was rich and wanted a child,
and now one weekend a month,
Jasper and I spend some
quality time together.
See you Monday.
Uh, wait a minute. Um, so...
That's what this is.
I'm just a... glorified babysitter.
No, no, no, no.
As per school policy, we're
calling it an internship.
That way, I don't have to pay you.
So, Jasper, looks like
it's just you and me.
What are you reading?
"Tips for surviving a nuclear attack."
The people of Nagasaki never saw it coming.
I know how they feel.
So Ben and I are having sex tomorrow.
Ew. Not in front of my kid's costume.
Sorry. It's our first time.
It's kind of a big deal.
First time? I thought sex was
like shaking hands for you.
It is. I like to get it over with early
so there's no pressure.
But with Ben, there's been
all this buildup, so...
Pressure?
Yeah.
I like him... a lot.
And I want our first time to be great.
That's sweet.
That's why I got some
sex drugs in Chinatown.
Less sweet.
"Woman love fluid."
I gotta put some tape over that.
This stuff work?
Even if it all it Jacks
up is my confidence,
that is good enough for me.
Okay. What do you think?
This looks like a cat, right?
Sure, after it's passed through a coyote.
What is going on?
You always go for easy costumes.
Didn't you once staple math
tests to Penny's jeans
and send her out as "Smarty Pants"?
Yes, but this year, Tom's new girlfriend
offered to make Penny's costume,
so I, of course, said I would.
Damn, why is there no
Chinese costume fluid?
Well, you're in luck.
I have a friend in New York
that is a costume designer,
and he has three Tony awards.
And he'll make my kid's cat outfit?
Sadly, he'll do anything for cash.
He's a huge cokehead.
That means he'll do it fast, too.
That's great!
I-I mean, for us.
Poor guy needs help.
My thoughts and prayers are with him.
Hey there.
If you're, uh, here for the
meeting, it just ended,
as I'm sure you can tell by the
massacre at the doughnut box.
Actually, I was just...
really looking to talk to somebody.
Well, I'm Allen.
Carlos.
Why don't you tell me what's
going on with you, Carlos?
Come on in.
Okay. All right.
I, uh... had a little incident
a few nights ago.
Uh-huh.
Got loaded... and I left the house,
and, uh... I don't remember doing it.
Uh-huh, you blacked out, huh?
Yeah, I'm so jealous of you guys.
Uh, I was always cursed with total recall
of every horrifying second of my benders.
So how often does this happen?
It doesn't.
I usually don't drink that much.
Just lately.
Yeah? Oh. So what's "lately"?
I don't know.
Two months, maybe.
Something happen two months ago?
You lose your job?
Did your wife leave you? Dog die?
No.
Nothing I can think of.
'Cause usually this sort
of thing is triggered
by some kind of traumatic incident.
You know, I don't think
this was such a good idea.
Hey, I wasn't trying to pry.
Allen, thanks, but I really gotta be going.
Was good meeting you, Carlos.
Listen, if, uh,
you ever wanna talk, here's my cell.
Day or night, I'll pick up.
Appreciate it.
Good luck to you.
Bree.
What? Is everything all right?
I just saw some miscreants
throwing eggs at your house.
I tried to run over and catch them,
but I was too late.
Ah, it's probably some kids
warming up for Halloween.
No, no, it wasn't kids, and
they shouted something
unpleasant about real estate developers,
including an anti-Australian slur.
Uh, I've never heard an
anti-Australian slur.
What was it?
I'd rather not repeat it.
The point is, there seems to
be some strenuous opposition
to the Chapman Woods development,
and as your liaison,
I think you should consider relocating it.
All right.
Let me consider it.
Nah. Screw 'em.
Excuse me?
I already sunk $100,000
into moving this project
from Hawkins Lake,
and there's...
Well... what happened at Hawkins Lake?
We were all set to go,
bulldozers at the ready,
and then the environmental impact study
turns up five endangered
yellow-spotted frogs.
Frogs?
Yeah. The slimy little bastards
are now the proud owners
of 50 acres of waterfront real estate.
I'm just curious. Have you had
your environmental impact study
in Chapman Woods yet?
Uh, tomorrow, but I'm not worried.
My guys have been over every inch of it.
Not a miserable amphibian in sight.
Yes.
And I can't imagine that
would change overnight.
A construction project for a frog?
If it's an endangered
yellow-spotted frog, they will.
Now come on. Help me find some.
Ugh. Things creep me out.
You know that story
where the princess has to kiss the frog,
turn him back into a prince?
So not worth it.
I don't care how rich his dad was.
Gaby, you know where they don't have frogs?
Prison! Which is where we're
gonna be if we don't plant some
at Ben's construction site.
Fine. I'll help.
Oh. Saw one. Ohh!
Oh, is that one?
Does he have spots on his legs?
He has to have spots on his legs.
Well, you're good with crafts.
You can stencil some on later.
Aah! Ohh!
Damn it!
This is more of a boys thing.
Why isn't Carlos here?
Because I didn't tell him
about the construction.
What? Why not?
Because he's got a lot
on his plate right now.
Or, actually, in his glass.
He's been drinking a lot.
Really? Do you want me to speak to him?
No. No. He's been going to A.A. meetings.
He said he met a great sponsor.
He's doing fine.
I certainly understand
what he's going through.
It's kind of a miracle
that I've stayed sober through all of this.
Don't move. There's one by your foot.
Aah!
This is gonna be a long day.
So... you wanna play some video games?
That's original.
Okay. Um...
Something more creative.
You wanna carve a Jack-o'-Lantern?
I'd rather stick a knife in my eye.
Only 36 hours to go.
37. He's always late.
I am the Candy-Bot 3000.
Please give candy.
Aw, M.J., you look amazing. I mean...
I am Mom-Bot 3000.
Costume approved.
You guys sound stupid.
Your insult does not compute.
Shut up! Nobody cares
about being a dumb robot!
Hey, what's going on?
I just hate all this Halloween stuff.
How can you hate a holiday
that's all about dressing up
and getting free candy?
It's the best day of the year.
Jasper, does your dad not let
you celebrate Halloween?
He says it's for kids.
You do know you're a kid, right?
Okay, that's it.
You and your father are coming
trick-or-treating with us.
He'll never go for that.
Oh, you just let me talk to him.
I can be pretty persuasive.
I'd rather stick a knife in my eye.
Oh, come on. Your son is dying
to go trick-or-treating.
It's just a couple hours.
Until I deliver these paintings,
it's the only thing I care about.
That and a cigarette.
Don't look at this. It's not done.
Gaby, will you stop with the sanitizer?
Your hands are gonna slide
right off the wheel.
I can't help it.
I can still feel those slimy things
crawling through my fingers.
Speaking of which,
how come I don't hear
anything moving in that box?
Shouldn't they be croaking or something?
Maybe they're resting. Or dead.
You don't think they're dead, do you?
Oh, God! Don't bring
that in the front seat.
I don't hear anything.
All right. I'm trying to remain calm.
Please tell me those are
your long-webbed fingers
on my arm.
Gaby, do not panic.
Aah! Get it off!
Stay calm! Stay calm!
Don't panic!
Watch the road! Oh, God!
I think it's on my leg!
Stop swerving!
I'm trying to get the lid back on!
Get it off me! Careful!
It's crawling under the brake pedal!
Not anymore!
Oh, they're getting away! They're so fast!
What the hell could endanger them?!
Ohh! Detailing is never gonna get that out!
We're so screwed.
Will you please stop saying that?
In 12 hours, those bulldozers
are gonna break ground.
I think the phrase "we are so screwed"
cannot be said enough.
There must be something we can do.
They're gonna find Alejandro's body.
They'll--they'll do an investigation.
They'll learn he's my stepfather.
Unless...
Unless what?
There's no body to be found.
Mom, I need my cat costume.
Dad and Jane will be here soon.
I'm just putting on the finishing touches.
The tracking number is jhkwrxa.
I'm not sure why the tracking numbers
are all letters, but it's your system, so--
Oh, forget it, forget it.
There he is.
Hey! Psst!
Up here! Up here!
Don't--don't ring the doorbell.
I just put my baby down for a nap.
Toss the package up here.
I'll catch it. I have three sons. Come on!
Nice.
I can't wait any longer. Let me see.
Mm!
Finished. All yours.
Thanks, mom.
I can't believe you made
this all by yourself.
Mrs. Scavo! I need a signature!
Let's go try it on. Come on.
Okay. Go, go.
I'm just saying you are one good wig
away from being a fantastic cowardly lion.
Drop it, witch.
Just say it for me once.
"I do believe in spooks.
I do, I do, I do believe in spooks."
Look, I'm only here because
you kidnapped my painting.
The ransom was two hours
of trick-or-treating,
no costume, no chitchat.
All I'm doing is counting the minutes
till I can get back to work.
Score. Check it out.
They had giant peanut butter cups.
Nice going, sweetie.
I got a chocolate bomb. You want some?
No, thanks, pal. What I want is to go.
But we've only done half the street.
Okay, well, tell you what.
What if we leave now, and
I'll give you 20 bucks?
You can buy all the candy you like.
Your father's just messing with you.
Run on ahead.
I promise I'll go fast, Andre.
He calls you "Andre"?
Oh, yeah, I prefer it.
"Dad" isn't an accurate characterization
of our relationship.
He's your son.
He's her son.
Biologically, he's yours.
Ontologically, he's getting
in the way of my work.
Well, psychologically,
you're a freakin' sociopath.
Do you see how desperately that boy
is trying to connect with you?
And you do everything you
can to push him away.
I'm not interested in the relationship.
Tough.
I mean, he's not a novel
you can just toss aside
if it's boring.
Or a painting you just walk past
'cause it's not interesting.
He's a person with feelings.
Okay, just keep going.
This is really making the time fly by.
I have spent the last few weeks
trying to get you to like me,
and I just realized something.
I don't like you.
Your painting is in the utility closet
next to your classroom.
Go take care of your masterpiece.
I'll take care of your son.
Hi.
Thank you for letting me tag
along trick-or-treating.
Chloe's 20 now, so I'm nostalgic
for things like this.
Aw, you're lucky. My older kids
are 20 as well, but this
one kept knocking me up
so now I won't get to be
nostalgic until I'm 90.
So... is Penny ready?
'Cause we gotta get to the McAllisters'
before they run out of popcorn balls.
She's just putting on her costume...
That I sewed with my hands,
and I'm pretty proud of it.
Mom!
This is amazing.
Look. I'm a kitten with a whip.
Meow.
This is just
in case she's attacked by dogs.
You're proud of this?
Yep. I thought it was cute.
Yeah, if she's trick-or-treating
for dollar bills!
It's completely inappropriate!
Honey, go back upstairs
and see if you can find
those "Smarty Pants."
Do I have to?
Penny, are you sure you
put the whole costume on?
I think so.
There wasn't a skirt that went with it?
'Cause I'm pretty sure a skirt
was a part of that pattern.
Right?
Yeah, yeah. There was.
Well, I'd bet I could help you
find that skirt your mom made.
I bet you could.
Go on.
Trick or treat?!
Hold that thought.
Trick or treat?!
What amazing costumes.
Now don't get me with your hook.
And look at you.
Aren't you the prettiest little princess
in the whole... world...
Uh...
Now... let's see if we can
find something "fun size"
for me to enjoy.
Whoa! Is it, uh...
Is it hot in here?
Uh... don't think so.
Okay.
Maybe I should, uh, take off a layer.
Mmm.
You all right?
I'm not sure. I've got this...
this tightness in my throat.
Yeah, and your eyes look a little glassy.
Uh, you sure you're okay?
We can do this another night, you know.
No, no, no. I'm fine, really.
Now... get over here, big man.
What about the house with the
spiderwebs and the bats?
That didn't scare you?
Nah, it takes a lot more
than that to scare me. Aah!
How did you get in here?
This was under the mat.
It's a great hiding place, by the way.
Had me stumped for a good four seconds.
Mommy?
Can we go trade candy?
Well, you'll have to ask Jasper's...
Andre.
Yeah, it's fine.
All right. Yeah.
Thought you were gonna
finish your painting.
I will.
But I was thinking about what you said.
And you realized the error of your ways
and came to tell me that?
God. Is that how things work in your world?
Look, I get you don't like me.
Most people don't.
I've learned to live with
that mainly by not caring.
Oh. I think you care.
I swear to God I don't.
You have to understand, Susan.
My work is always gonna come first.
Even before Jasper?
That's what I was getting to.
I heard what you said.
He is my son.
And I'm gonna try to be a better dad.
Well, I bet it'll make
you a better painter.
I bet it won't.
You need to know something
about being a true artist.
This--this gift, this curse,
whatever it is--
it consumes you and blots out
everything else--
friends, family, everything.
I would never let that happen to me.
You may not have a choice.
Trick or...
That's weird.
They didn't even wait for the candy.
How's dinner coming?
Oh, it's just about r--
Oh, my God.
What happened to you?
What?
You need to see a doctor.
Oh. Over this little rash? Don't be silly.
I'm not moving.
Oh, that's not good.
You know, o-on second thought,
I'm not really feeling very...
Oh, okay. Okay.
Definitely time for a doctor.
Almost finished.
Wow, from cathouse to
house cat in ten minutes.
You could do this professionally.
You mean like the person who made it?
Yeah. I may have...
slightly overexaggerated my sewing skills.
I guess... I was feeling...
This is new for me.
It's new for me, too.
You gonna bust me?
For trying to look good?
Lynette, when my husband left
me for our Swedish au pair,
I went out and bought my daughter a car.
She was 13.
Well, then it's official.
You're better at everything, even bribery.
Please. You had a career
and raised five kids.
I could barely keep it together with one.
Who says I kept it together?
I think you're doing pretty great.
You're smart, confident.
In fact, this might sound a little weird,
but... you seem like the kind of
person I could be friends with.
It doesn't sound weird.
Before, when you saved my ass out there,
that was the kind of thing a friend does.
Happy to help.
Then...
can I ask you to help
me with something else?
Sure.
You think maybe you could stop
trying to take my husband away from me?
What?
Your marriage ended.
Whoa. Whoa. That's not fair.
The circumstances were
completely different.
Maybe they were.
But you still know how it hurts.
So I'm asking you, please,
back off.
Okay?
You think I'm gonna give up on him
just because you can't accept
your marriage is over?
We have five kids.
One of them is just a baby.
I'm not letting my husband
go without a fight.
Well, according to Tom, you're
always looking for a fight.
My ex was like that, too.
You know, and when you
find somebody who isn't,
you wanna hang on to them.
You should give this to Penny.
Okay, the girls are asleep.
Listen for the doorbell
in case there are some
late trick-or-treaters.
I know the drill.
Oh, and don't wait up for me. I'll be late.
We're taking Lynette out for a drink.
Oh. Sorry.
I'm fine, Gaby.
It's just her first holiday
without Tom and the kids,
so we wanna give her a fun night out,
you know, to boost her spirits.
Bye.
We're digging up the body tonight?
We have no choice.
Ben's bulldozers start tearing
up the woods tomorrow morning.
Where are Carlos and Susan?
Carlos is not in a good place right now.
I didn't wanna freak him out.
And Susan has done nothing but
freak out, so it's just us.
Come on.
Oh. Okay.
I... I can't believe this.
We're getting rid of a dead body again.
I know. I'm so sorry.
No, I just spent the evening
with my husband's new girlfriend.
This doesn't sound so bad.
How you feeling?
Better.
They gave me a shot of cortisone.
The doctor said it was something I ate.
Maybe strawberries or nuts.
Really? Uh, he told me it
was the woman love fluid.
Okay. Good-bye. Nice knowing you.
I mean, you do know
you're not supposed to
roofie yourself, right?
Go away.
Well, I don't get it.
Now why would you take something like that?
Because... I wanted tonight
to be special, okay?
And...
Because I haven't been with
anyone since my divorce.
You...
When I moved here, you offered me sex
before you even knew my name.
Well, yeah, but that was before...
Can I put the sheet back on?
Mm.
That was before I realized
how much I like you.
Well, I like you, too.
Uh, would you like some,
uh, company under there?
♪ Trick or treat? ♪
♪ Trick or treat? ♪
Uh, so this is the part
where you give me candy.
I don't know about this. What ever happened
to "never return to the
scene of the crime"?
She's got a point.
We just need to do this
in the most efficient manner possible--
find the grave, dig up the body...
Sounds easy so far.
Wrap it in a tarp, weight
it down with some bricks
and toss it in the lake.
I have all the supplies in my trunk,
along with clean towels, hand sanitizer,
and breathing masks in case
the stench is overwhelming.
Anyone wanna guess what a corpse looks like
after two months in the ground?
Ohh.
Oh, yeah. Is it just bones,
or is there, like, other stuff, too?
Ugh. Hey!
Shh!
Did you hear something?
Yeah. What is that?
Hey!
Who's there?
Who is that?!
I don't know. What do we do?
Run. Okay!
No! Split up.
Aah!
Where'd he go? Is he gone?
For now, but we gotta hurry.
I-I think we're close.
I recognize this area.
Oh, God, this is creeping me out.
Well, it doesn't help that it's Halloween.
Let's just dig him up
and get this over with.
Okay.
Gaby?
Lynette?
Oh, my God.
Ladies?
Ladies!
Bree?
Paranoia...
It's the irrational feeling
that the whole world is against you.
No.
But it's no longer paranoia
when you discover...
that someone really is out to get you.

Previously on Desperate Housewives
Lynette confronted
Tom's new girlfriend.
You think maybe you
could stop
trying to take
my husband away from me?
You think I'm gonna give up
on him just because
you can't accept
your marriage is over?
Hey, Mike!
Ben found out about Mike's past...
Ex-con?
And hired him.
I can definitely use you.
Bree showed Gaby
the threatening note.
I'm sorry
to burden you with this...
Why did you have to
tell me?
And then she discovered
the location
of Ben's new development.
We're digging up the body?
Ben's bulldozers start
tearing up the woods
tomorrow morning.
Where are Carlos and Susan?
I didn't wanna
freak 'em out.
And Susan has done nothing
but freak out, so it's just us.
But when they got there...
No!
They found someone
had beaten them to it.
No matter
what the circumstances,
Bree Van de Kamp always found
a way to stay in control.
She curbed her impulses.
She enforced
a strict dress code.
She maintained
a strong moral center.
Yes, Bree was always in control,
so when it came
to handling a crisis...
This is a nightmare.
What are we gonna do?
It made perfect sense that
she was in the driver's seat.
Yeah. I mean,
I can't believe
the worst thing
that happened tonight
was not getting to move
a dead body.
Ladies, please,
I need to hear myself think.
Oh, my God!
What if he's alive?
Right, and after
a 2-month dirt nap,
he clawed his way out.
No, someone must have
dug him out.
But who?
What if it was the cops?
No! I can't go to jail!
What, and we can?
Yes! You'll start a gang.
Bree will work in the kitchen.
I'm the smallest one.
I am so ending up
somebody's bitch!
Shh! It wasn't the police.
They would have treated it
like a crime scene,
and that awful yellow tape
would have been everywhere.
Okay, then.
Think about this, Bree.
What if it's someone
who knows what we did,
and it made them sick...
And now
they're going to tell?
Why is she talking like that?
Gaby is engaging
in wild speculation,
which isn't at all
productive.
There has to be
a simple explanation.
We just need to take
a deep breath and think,
and the answer will be
right in front us.
Susan.
Oh, my God.
Of course!
Why would Susan move the body?
Because she's cuckoo crazy.
She's been flipping out
ever since we buried the guy.
Okay, then what if it was her?
What do we do?
We march over
and we ask if she did it,
and if she did,
I know an empty grave
that's going to waste.
But if she didn't,
then we just admitted that we
went to the woods without her.
Imagine what cuckoo
will do with that.
Clearly, we have to be
diplomatic, crafty.
We'll ask indirect questions,
scan her house for clues.
We'll gather information
without arousing suspicion.
Okay, Bree. Well, seems like
you got a good handle on this.
Definitely.
Let us know how it goes.
Yes, when it came to a crisis,
everyone was happy to have
Bree in the driver's seat...
Fine. I'll talk to Susan.
Even if Bree herself would have
preferred to be a passenger.
As the mother of five,
Lynette Scavo was used
to uncomfortable questions.
Why are you eating
Santa's cookies?
What happened
to my goldfish?
Why were you and daddy making
funny noises last night?
Yes, after five children,
Lynette thought
she'd heard it all,
until there was one question...
Are dad and Jane
gonna get married?
She never saw coming.
Why would you ask that?
I don't know.
They're spending a lot
of time together, and...
It's okay. You can say it.
They seem really happy.
You told her to say it.
Honey, just because
people are happy
and spend time together,
it doesn't mean
they're gonna get married.
I mean, your aunt Renee and I
spend time together.
And we're not getting married
till your mom makes
a lot more money.
I'll get it.
Yeah.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
You all ready to see "wicked"?
Hello, Lynette.
Hello.
Oh, my God. Look at your hair.
We're twins.
Yes, you are.
Penny, where did you learn
to do that?
Jane taught me.
Oh, it's easy.
I could teach you, too.
Oh, I know how to do it.
Okay. Uh, we should go.
We might not be home
until 11:00.
On a school night?
It's my fault.
I went to high school
with the wicked witch,
and she invited us backstage.
Is that okay?
O-oh, my God.
Can I, mom?
What can I say? Since you
asked me in front of Penny.
Let's go, zuzu.
Yeah.
Bye.
"Zuzu"?
Yeah. She's got
a cute nickname for Penny.
I bet she's got one
for you, too... "Doormat."
What?
It's bad enough
she stole your husband,
and now you're letting her
take your daughter, too?
What am I supposed to do?
I'm not gonna drag Penny
into the middle of this.
Well, apparently, Jane doesn't
play by the same rules.
I think it's time
to fight dirty.
I don't know how to do that.
Well, you're in luck.
She might have gone to school
with the wicked witch,
but you went to school
with me.
It's portfolio review time.
That's the special moment
where I tell you all
how you're letting me down.
Okay, uh, speaking as
a former teacher...
Still pontificating.
Now some might say,
"he must think
pretty highly of himself
to judge other people
so harshly,"
to which I say,
yeah, he does.
Can you believe this guy?
I would die for him.
Yeah.
That's a healthy attitude.
So while you're opening
your portfolios
and arranging your works,
let me tell you what
I do not wanna see.
Bowls of fruit.
Portraits of children.
Frigid winter landscapes.
Lush summer vistas.
However, I do enjoy
a nice ocean scene...
Just so it's not ruined
by the addition
of a sad, little sailboat.
Did you look
in myportfolio?
As a matter of fact, I did.
I wanted to steel myself
for disappointment.
Okay, again,
as a former teacher,
that's not how
you motivate people.
Apparently not.
You haven't grown an inch
since you started my class.
Your work's the same
as it's always been...
Technically proficient
but totally boring.
You never surprise me.
Amy, on the other hand,
is nothing but surprises.
Thank you.
Don't talk, dear.
Her technique is atrocious.
Cats with crayons could draw
more convincingly,
but what she does is real,
and it bleeds.
And I love it.
I would follow him into hell.
I think we already have.
Celia, get back here!
Give me that now!
Hey, hey, hey,
enough with the screaming!
Come on. Sit down. Come on.
What are we having?
Spaghetti and meat-shapes?
Well, they started off as balls.
What do you want from me?
Is daddy eating with us?
No, sweetie.
He's taking a nap.
Celia!
Use a fork, not the doll.
Mom, remember that cabin
on the lake?
Can we rent it again
for spring vacation?
Spring? It isn't even
Thanksgiving yet.
I know, but we always plan
our vacations in the fall.
Well...
Who knows what
we'll be doing then?
Let's... just worry about that
later, okay?
But we know we wanna go there.
Why can't we plan it now?
Will you just stop?!
Just eat your food.
And what am I gonna
tell her?
"Sorry, sweetie.
We can't rent that cabin
'cause daddy and I
might be in jail by spring."
Will you stop?
We're not going to jail.
You can't promise that,
Carlos.
It's been two months.
Nothing's happened. Relax.
Where's this coming from?
I'm just saying, a cop could
show up at the door any day
and destroy our family.
And we don't even have someone
to take care of the kids.
Sure, we do. We named
a guardian when we did our will.
Yeah, Susan.
She'll be my cellmate,
and we'll be making
license plates
with Bree and Lynette.
Ah, right.
Well, we'll just find
someone else.
How about McCluskey?
Are you kidding?
I've got meat in the freezer
that's gonna be around
longer than she is.
Oh, I know.
I know, and they're perfect.
Bob and Lee.
Huh?
No, think about it.
Two gay guys who could have
been out dancing every night,
adopted a child?
They chose this?
Yeah, what does that tell us?
They're unstable.
No, I'm serious.
They're great parents.
Yeah, they are.
Okay. Bob and Lee.
We'll ask 'em.
But don't worry.
We're not going anywhere.
Can't promise that.
Dad and Jane are coming.
I'm gonna wait on the porch.
Oh, and Jane's cooking,
so I won't need dinner.
Everything okay?
Huh?
I'm sorry.
I was just looking
at all these pictures
in your baby book.
I guess I was getting
a little nostalgic.
Mom, my baby book has,
like, five pictures in it.
But they're really good.
You wanna see? Look.
Here's you with me and your dad
at your 1st birthday.
Look at us.
We were really
a family then.
We're a family now.
Aren't we?
Of course.
Oh, of course.
It's just...
Just what?
Well, since you asked,
things are
going to be different
since your dad brought Jane
into the picture.
You don't like her, do you?
Oh, I didn't say that.
She's a very smart lady,
and she obviously knows
how to get what she wants...
Medical career,
other people's husbands.
But I'm not gonna say
anything bad.
I know. You like her.
Well... I thought she was nice.
She is... to you.
Maybe that's because she's
trying to steal you, too.
But like I said,
I don't wanna say anything bad.
You should go wait out
on the porch.
You don't need to sit here
listening to my...
Legitimate whining.
I don't wanna go over there.
Oh?
I wanna stay here...
With you.
Well, if you feel strongly
about it,
and I can tell you do,
I could call your dad
and make an excuse.
Would you?
Sweetie, I would do
anything for you.
You are my daughter...
My biological daughter.
Thanks. I love you, mom.
I love you, too, bobo.
"Bobo"?
We'll work on it.
Ugh! I hate you, Andre!
Susan.
I rang your doorbell twice.
Is everything okay?
Oh, I can't get his voice
out of my head.
Voice?
Yeah. He keeps telling me
how bad I am.
Oh, really?
Uh, does this voice also
tell you to do things?
Sorry.
I know I must sound crazy.
It's just, I've been staring at
this blank canvas for two days.
I don't sleep. I don't eat.
Do you dig things up?
What?
What?
Did you just ask me
if I dug something up?
Oh! I think someone's been
staring at a blank canvas
too long.
Bree, what's going on?
Why are you here?
Okay, I'm just gonna come
right out and ask you.
Did you...
Hey.
Mike, what are you
doing home?
I-I thought you were
meeting Ben about the job.
Yeah, I was, and then he called
and said he had to cancel.
Something happened
at the site,
and they had to shut down
the whole project.
That's weird.
Y-yeah.
Did he say what it was?
No.
But he sure
didn't sound good.
Well, I really
should be going.
Wait. You said you were
gonna ask me something.
No, I didn't.
You really need to get away
from those paint fumes.
Guardians?
Yeah!
You know, in case
something happens to us,
we think you guys would be
terrific parents to our girls.
Wow.
What an honor.
Well, you know,
we love Juanita and...
The other one.
Celia.
Tip of my tongue.
But you have so many
closer friends on the Lane.
What about Susan?
Yeah, that'd never work.
Why not?
Um, well, Susan...
Is...
A racist.
What? I-I've known her
for years.
I've never seen her
be racist.
It's new.
Yeah.
What about Bree?
Yeah! An alcoholic with
a house full of guns? Genius.
Lynette? McCluskey?
Anyone at all?
Hang on.
You guys have a problem
with our girls?
It's just, we're still learning
how to take care of one kid.
You've got two,
and they're both...
You know.
What?
Monsters.
You know it. We know it.
Why are we dancing around it?
I was gonna say "spirited."
No, no, no, no.
See, they used to be like that.
They've changed.
They're all grown up now.
I babysat them
two months ago.
Juanita punched me in the neck,
and the other one bit me.
Celia. Her name is Celia.
Okay, you know,
seriously, guys,
they're like
different people now.
So well-behaved.
Yeah. Y-you have to see it
to believe it.
You know what?
That's a great idea.
What? What is?
Why don't you have us over
for dinner tomorrow?
And we can see how
well-behaved they truly are.
Oh, my God!
That is a great idea.
But I don't know about tomorrow,
because the girls...
Are busy
with their Bible pageant,
and their extensive
charity work.
Tomorrow.
Tomorrow.
Bye, guys.
See you at dinner.
We're dead.
Yeah.
Okay, Bob and Lee
are coming over for dinner
tonight.
That gives me nine hours
to teach you
to be courteous, gracious,
and well-mannered...
Exact opposite
of what you usually are.
This is why you kept us
home from school?
Oh, you're in school,
and class is in session.
Okay, now which one
is the salad fork?
What's salad?
When is the last time
you brushed your...
Is this a lollipop?!
Told you it wasn't
a good hiding place.
Come on. Think!
Who won the Tony
for best musical in 1995?
This is too hard. Why can't
gay people like cartoons?
Did you get that
out of the garbage?
Hey. Didn't you get
my message?
About Penny not being able
to come over? Yeah.
Been getting a lot
of those messages lately.
Penny?!
So why are you here?
To see my daughter.
I wanna find out
what's going on.
Hey!
Hey, dad.
I haven't seen you this week.
Is everything okay?
Yeah. I've just had
a lot of homework and stuff.
Why don't you do it
at my place?
You know, if it...
If it's science,
Jane lives right upstairs,
and she's a real brainiac.
No, thanks.
I'd rather have mom help.
Do you have a problem
with Jane, sweetie?
I've got a really big test
tomorrow, so I should...
Hang on. Hang on.
May-maybe you and I need
a little one-on-one time.
You... you remember that park
where I taught you
to play catch?
Well, I'm gonna be there
tomorrow after school... just me.
We can hang out or...
Or do whatever you want.
What do you say?
Okay.
Huh. That's weird.
Penny and Jane were
getting along great,
and then, uh,
all of a sudden...
All of a sudden what?
Did you say anything to her
about not liking Jane?
Penny's a big girl.
She has her own opinions.
Okay.
I just wanna make sure
that we remember
that this thing between us
is between us, not the kids.
Hey, don't blame me.
I'm not the one who jumped
into a relationship
without thinking
about the consequences.
You made your bed...
With someone else.
I'm gonna go help our daughter
with her homework.
Bree?
Hello.
I wanted to celebrate
your first day of construction
with lunch.
I'm already eating.
There was a little problem.
Really? I hope you don't think
me nosy if I ask...
My guys found a body
buried in the woods.
Oh, my.
Did you call the police?
Not yet.
So they found a body. How?
Uh, doing soil samples.
Um, they dug it up
halloween night,
put it in a storage shed.
And why have you waited
so long to call the police?
'Cause I keep hoping
I'll find a way out of this.
'Cause once I call,
my project becomes
a crime scene.
They shut it down.
I lose a lot of time,
and... a lot of money.
What a shame.
It must be so tempting
to just...
Make the body disappear.
I'm sure you've
considered re-burying it
or dissolving it in acid
or wrapping it in heavy chains
and dropping it in a lake.
I'm sure
you've considered that.
Y-yeah, yeah.
Of course I have.
Uh... but if I hide this,
and it comes out later,
I'm committing a felony.
And I...
I can't take that risk.
I know, but think
of all the people
who'll lose their jobs,
and... and what about the...
The poor men
who dug up the body?
They... they could face
charges.
I know that, Bree.
I'm sorry. You're just
saying the same stuff
I've been thinking all day.
But there's no way
out of this.
There isn't, is there?
I got to go call the cops,
get this over with.
Bree?
He was a horrible man.
Wh-what?
You know who this was?
He hurt a child...
Someone I care about
very much,
and he was gonna hurt her
again.
Bree, did you kill him?
Well, tell me
you didn't kill him.
I need to know
before I go to the police.
I didn't kill him.
My friend did,
and I helped bury him here.
Oh, God.
And you want me to...
To make this go away.
I know it's a lot to ask.
But yes.
That's what I want.
Well, I'm sorry, Bree.
I can't.
And thank you, lord,
for this wonderful food.
And bless our good friends,
Bob and Lee.
We are so grateful
to have them as our neighbors.
And bless their daughter Jenny
who is away at her sleepover.
We miss her so much.
And bless all the children
of the world
whether they have
a mommy and daddy,
two mommies,
or two daddies.
Amen.
Amen.
That was really nice. We never
pray before meals at our house.
Well, some meals you just
need to pray before.
That's a beautiful dress,
Juanita.
I guess.
Oh, Juanita.
Don't be modest.
Oh.
Isn't there a story behind
that dress you'd like to tell?
Well, actually,
it's kind of like Anita's dress
in "west side story,"
my all-time favorite musical.
You like musicals?
Hmm. Do I like musicals?
Of course you do,
silly. You love them!
Oh.
Ooh.
All right,
I'm gonna have to owe you.
I'm out of singles.
I can break a $5.
Such a good girl.
She sure is.
Anyone need salt?
No.
Oh, God.
You broke me.
And now you're inside.
I can't paint.
I just stare
at the empty canvas
and wonder how much you're
gonna hate what I do next.
Oh, I can help you with that.
You can?
Yes. I'll hate it a lot.
We good?
What do I have to do to get you
to take me seriously?
Hey.
Oh.
O-of course.
It makes perfect...
This is why you like Amy
better in class.
No, I like Amy better in class
because she's a better artist.
This is why I like her in bed.
See ya.
So as you can see, Susan,
I'm a little busy,
so if we're done...
We're not done.
I am totally adrift
in that class.
Okay.
Would it help if I told you
what your grade is?
No. I-I-I... I mean,
that's not what I was...
You're getting an "a."
Really?
Well, actually, an "a"-plus.
Oh, wait. I'm sure
that's not enough for you.
You probably also need to know
everybody else will get a "d."
Amy, you're getting a "d."
Okay!
Congratulations, Susan.
I do not want you to give me
a fake grade.
It doesn't mean anything
if you're lying.
Well, why not?
You're lying.
No, I'm not.
Every time you sit down
to paint
and don't paint the fear
and pain that's in you,
you're lying.
Every time you care
what somebody else thinks
about your art, you're lying.
Uh, I have to go.
I used to think you were
holding something back,
and now I wonder if there
just isn't anything there.
So enjoy your "a"-plus,
but don't come to my class
anymore. We're done.
Gaby, it was
a wonderful night.
And you were so right
about the girls.
They are an absolute delight.
When they sang
the "dreamgirls" number...
Goose bumps, seriously.
Aw, I'm just glad
you could come.
You guys are so special
to us.
Gaby, did you leave
the garage door open?
Oh, I mean,
you're practically family.
That's why
when we were thinking
who we'd want to be guardians
of our precious angels,
you two were the only ones
we considered.
I mean, the girls absolutely
adore you, and...
What?
Oh, dear.
This aside, it was a pretty good
evening, wasn't it?
I don't get it.
What were you thinking?
Your father and I
did not raise you like this.
Sorry.
Can you just tell me why?
I want to understand.
I thought you liked
Bob and Lee.
I do. They're nice.
Then I'm confused.
Why'd you do it?
Fine. Go to bed. We'll talk
about your punishment tomorrow
and how you're gonna make
this up to them.
Is daddy dying?
What?
No! Why would you even
say that?
Because you guys have been
acting different,
and daddy sleeps a lot,
and... everyone seems sad.
Even when we're happy,
it's like...
I don't know. Just sad.
Daddy's fine,
and mommy's fine, too.
Then why do you want us
to go live with Bob and Lee?
I heard you guys talking
about it. Sorry.
Ohh.
Honey, it's called
being a guardian.
Every family has that.
It's just in case.
But trust me,
nothing's gonna happen.
So... we can rent that cabin
for spring vacation?
Sure.
And everything's
going to be okay?
You promise?
Cross my heart.
Okay, last week it was
a teething biscuit
caked to my ass, and now this?
Why are we stopping?
What are you looking at?
Penny's meeting Tom here
for some one-on-one time,
and I wanted to make sure
Saint Jane didn't make it
a threesome.
Threesome? Looks more like
a lonesome to me.
She didn't come.
Well, maybe she's busy.
You said Jane's a doctor, right?
I was talking about Penny.
She didn't come.
Well... at least you don't
have to worry about Jane
busting up your family.
You're right.
I seem to be doing that
just fine on my own.
Hello, Bree.
Chuck.
What are you doing here?
Relax. Just police business.
Following up
on a missing person report.
Have you seen this man?
Two months ago?
The night
of that dinner party.
We were walking to your house,
and we passed him.
Right here. You remember?
I've never seen that man
before in my life.
Have you ever heard
of microexpressions, Bree?
They flash
across a person's face
for a fraction of a second,
revealing their true emotion,
instead of the one
they're covering with.
It's how cops know
when people lie.
Well, that's all
very fascinating,
but I don't have time
for this.
For example, um,
when a person is distressed,
their eyebrows go up,
causing lines to appear
across the forehead.
Don't touch me.
Do you know,
the funny thing is...
I don't need a microexpression
to tell me when you're lying.
'Cause I know that look
from personal experience.
I saw it every time
I was in your bed
and you said you loved me.
So since I know you're lying,
why don't you start
telling me the truth?
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
I'm a cop.
I know.
Keep harassing this woman,
and you're gonna wind up
an ex-cop.
Um, you might want to watch it
with the tough guy act, buddy.
Oh, unlike you, officer,
it's not an act.
I'll be seeing you.
Big mistake.
Well, he's a delight.
Oh, God. I'm shaking.
Hey, hey, hey.
Does this have something
to do with, uh...
What we talked about
in the woods?
Yes.
Then you've got nothing
to be scared about.
Well, it's pretty hard
to build a case without a body.
Oh, my. Thank you.
Why would you do that
for me?
Ah, you never know.
Maybe someday...
I might need something
from you.
What are we... what?
I thought we were
going to the mall.
No.
Sweetie, listen...
Can we get outta here?
Please?
No, we can't.
You need to spend
some time with your dad.
I don't want to.
I'm not giving you a choice.
Look at him. Look.
You know why
he's sitting over there?
Because he misses you
so much.
Then he shouldn't have
left us for Jane.
Well, that's not
what happened.
He didn't leave us.
He left me.
And he didn't do it for Jane.
He did it because...
We just don't make
each other happy,
and then he met Jane,
and I guess she does...
Make him happy, so...
Here we are.
But you said that Jane...
I-I know.
I said a lot of things
I shouldn't have.
I'm sorry.
He loves you, Penny.
We both do.
There's no bad guys here.
There's just people
trying to figure things out,
and there's
one of those people.
And I know he would love to
play catch with his daughter.
You're way prettier
than her.
You, uh, want something to drink?
Uh, no.
This isn't a social visit.
I need to ask you something,
and I couldn't do it
over the phone.
Oh?
Remember when I said
I might need you to, uh,
color outside the lines
from time to time.
Yeah.
We found a body
out in Chapman woods.
Now it's probably just
some homeless guy.
But if we report it...
I'll take care of it.
Just like that?
There's nothing else
you need to know?
It's better if I don't.
I owe you one.
Ah.
Oh, hey, Ben.
Hey, Susan.
Uh, I'm just leaving.
See you at work.
So you got the job?
That's great.
Yeah.
Just wait till you hear
what the job is.
So... Ben will dispose
of the body,
permanently, he assures me,
and we will be in the clear.
Wow, just like that.
Bree? It's me!
Come in!
Did anybody else think
this would feel... better?
I think it feels great.
Well done, Bree.
Guess we got away
with it.
Oh, thank God you're here.
Susan, what's wrong?
Okay, uh... you know how Ben
is putting up those new condos?
He's doing it in Chapman woods.
And some of his guys
found the body.
He just asked Mike
to get rid of it.
What?
You're kidding.
Get out of town!
What's going on?
Sweetie,
we kind of already knew.
Who told you?
No one. We k-kinda went
out there to move the body,
but it was gone.
And... and then I went to Ben,
and he had it,
and he was planning
on getting rid of it.
So, wait.
Y-you knew all of this,
and it never occurred to you
to tell me?
Yeah.
But bright side is
we're all in the clear now.
Yeah.
Chardonnay?
I don't believe it.
You drag me into this thing.
I am out of my mind with guilt,
then there's
this massive complication
which could endanger me
and my family,
and you don't even tell me?
And here's
why we didn't tell her.
What the hell does that mean?
Oh, let's face it, Susan.
You're kind of a loose cannon.
Yeah, I mean, 15 minutes
after we made a pact
to keep this secret, you were
begging us to tell Mike.
Oh, yeah? Well, guess what?
I didn't tell Mike.
Carlos did.
So who's your loose cannon now?
What? Why would
Carlos do that?
Oh, I don't know.
Maybe because unlike you,
he has a conscience.
Oh, don't push it, Susan!
Hey, hey, hey. Take it easy.
The important thing is
the body is gone.
We're gonna be okay.
Yeah, as long as we
don't get another letter.
What letter?
Yeah, what letter?
Gaby, we never
told them about the letter.
Crap.
Susan, wait.
No, no,
you get a blackmail letter...
The same one Mary Alice got,
and you don't tell me?
We didn't think
you could handle it.
You said it yourself. You're out
of your mind with guilt.
Our pact was to keep this thing
a secret,
not to keep secrets
from each other.
We're done.
Oh, don't you think
you're overreacting a little?
I don't think she is.
What's your excuse for not
telling me about the letter?
Well, honey, you were going
through all that stuff with Tom.
Yeah, we were trying
to protect you.
Protect me? What am I, a child?
Someone knows what we did.
I have a right to know that.
Of course you do.
You know what my life
feels like right now?
Everything I thought I knew,
everything I could count on
is going away.
That's not true.
You can count on us.
No! Apparently I can't!
Yes, we're all seeking control
over something in our lives.
We may want to cover up
the remains
of a troubling secret...
Or ease the pain
of letting go...
Or erase the mistakes
of our children.
But sometimes the only way we
can truly change our lives...
Finally.
Is by letting go completely...
No matter what the cost.
Previously on...
Detective Vance got aggressive...
Have you seen this man?
But Ben came to the rescue.
It's pretty hard to build
a case without a body.
I'll take care of it.
And Mike got rid of the body.
But so many secrets led
to a falling-out...
We're done.
Don't you think you're overreacting?
I don't think she is.
And Susan expressed her anger
the only way she knew how.
There is nothing more peaceful
than the sounds of Wisteria lane at night.
Whether it's the murmur of
a neighbor's television...
the hum of the street lamps...
or the songs of the night birds...
Wisteria lane is so peaceful
that even the slightest disturbance...
can be very alarming.
9-1-1.
There's an intruder in my home.
I'm at 4355 Wisteria lane. Please hurry.
Oh, my god.
Chuck.
Hello, Bree.
What are you doing here?
I could have shot you.
I heard your call over the radio.
When I got here,
the door was wide open, so...
I'm just gonna have a look around.
If you don't mind putting
the gun in your pocket
while I do.
So tell me again what you heard.
Um, a loud bang and then some footsteps,
like, um, like someone
had forced their way in.
Are you sure you didn't
accidentally leave the door open?
I'm positive I locked it.
Well, I don't know what to tell you.
Maybe it was just some drifter
looking for a few bucks,
and you scared him off.
We don't get a lot of
drifters around here.
Except for that guy we saw
right out front a few months ago.
The one who turned up as a missing person?
I told you, I don't remember
anything about that.
And yet you're positive
you locked your door
before you went to bed last night.
It's funny, the things we remember
and the things we don't.
Are you interrogating me?
No, of course not.
You're a victim.
And why would you say that?
Because it's obvious to
me what's going on here.
Someone's sending you a message.
What kind of message?
Maybe they think you're hiding something.
Maybe they're trying to rattle you,
hoping you'll slip up.
Or maybe they just don't want you
to feel safe in your own home.
Yes, there's nothing more peaceful
than a night on Wisteria lane.
But I wouldn't lose any
sleep over this, Bree.
I'll be keeping an eye on you.
Until someone comes along...
and disturbs the peace.
In a stressful world,
we can all be forgiven for
having a few weaknesses.
Some of us are lured by a sweet treat...
others, by a sad face.
And still others,
by the pull of a great novel.
But Gabrielle Solis was about to discover
that some weaknesses...
Is he yours?
Aren't so easy to forgive.
Depends. Is he drunk?
Unless he throws up in
cabs when he's sober?
I'm so sorry.
Here's 20 bucks for the ride
and another 20 for your upholstery.
This will make you feel better.
Oh, it smells like hot sauce.
Yeah, it's a mexican hangover cure.
It's the only thing
I inherited from my family
that's actually worth anything.
I'm really sorry about all this.
I thought it would get better
after Ben did what he did, but...
it hasn't.
Maybe we need to get you help,
like rehab or something.
I'm not addicted, Gaby.
It's just when I'm stressed,
this is what I do.
Really? You were stressed on
the golf course this morning?
It was work,
and there's always
drinking when it's work.
We're golfing with a client... beer.
We're hammering out a deal... wine.
We make the deal... champagne.
Well, maybe you need to take
a little time away from work.
Dry out. Kick-start your sobriety.
I am the C.E.O. If I do that,
the whole place will fall apart.
And if you don't, you'll fall apart.
Maybe you're right.
But I can't do it today.
I got payroll to sign.
But you're sweating bourbon.
You're not going anywhere.
I'll go in and I'll sign it for you.
You can't sign my name.
Oh, please, I forge your
signature all the time.
How else do you think
I got that platinum card?
Wow, I must be in bad shape.
I don't even have the energy to get mad.
Well, with any luck,
you'll forget I said it.
I'm sure some of you feel
I've been too hard on you
these past few weeks.
I think I speak for all of
us when I say "All of us."
Well, after today,
you will long for the mother's milk
that has been my criticism.
Please meet our special guest,
my art dealer
and the owner of the Bergman gallery...
Felix Bergman.
I smell fear and mediocrity.
Oh, god.
It's like someone left Andre
in the dryer too long.
Felix has agreed to evaluate your work,
give honest feedback,
and teach you the business of art.
So... what do you call this piece?
"A celebration of the female nude."
This is why I don't sleep with women.
It's repulsive.
Well, it's not a literal...
Mind drifting, eyelids drooping, and...
I'm gone.
He's not a critic.
He's a little ball of hate.
Oh, god.
No art student's portfolio
would be complete
without the obligatory squares
and circles colliding,
or what I like to call
man's inhumanity to art.
Well, Amy's one of my
most promising students.
I find her work to be bold,
defiant, and dazzlingly layered.
You're shtupping her, aren't you?
Regardless, I just think that
there's a place for her work.
I think you may be right.
Found it.
So... what do you have for me?
The same thing you have for us... contempt.
Excuse me?
We get it.
You're a super sophisticated
art snob who hates everything.
Well, guess what? I'm not playing.
Susan...
No. I am not getting my teeth kicked in
just because your mother
didn't breast-feed you.
Go play your game with someone else.
Look, if you wanna be
a professional artist,
you need to develop a thick skin.
Did you paint this?
Yes, I did, and I have no interest
in hearing what you think of it.
Well, that's too bad,
because I think it's brilliant.
Really?
Really?
It's original.
Dark, brooding. It tells a story.
I'm totally drawn in.
Congratulations, Andre.
I do believe you've struck artist.
Yeah, I suppose she shows promise.
She may amount to something one day.
One day?
This girl has arrived.
In fact, she reminds me of a young... you.
Now, now...
where's that thick skin
you were crowing about?
And for the den, Franklin
wants a southwestern look.
You know, navajo rugs, red chili peppers,
chairs made of horns.
Southwestern. Fun.
And bound to come back in style
since it's been out so long.
We can't wait to work with you, Cindy.
Yes. All we need is a $5,000 deposit,
and then I will saddle up,
mosey into town,
and rustle up that wagon wheel table.
What's the date today?
Oh, the 13th.
13th? No, can't be.
Yes. Why?
It's my wedding anniversary. 22 years.
Congratulations. 22 years.
What is that... copper? brass?
Separation, in my case.
Oh. I'm sorry. I saw your ring,
and I just assumed that...
Yeah. Still wearing it,
even though we're hanging on by a thread.
You poor thing.
Yes, we're all devastated.
Would you like a pen?
I remember what my mother said to me
on my wedding day.
It's bad luck to get married on the 13th,
and for 21 years,
Tom and I have been laughing
about how wrong she was.
Not this year.
Yeah, make it out Perry-Scavo designs.
Well, don't give up, Lynette.
It's never too late.
Yeah. I think his girlfriend might disagree
with you on that one...
His beautiful doctor girlfriend.
That's P-E-R-R...
Now you listen to me.
My Franklin and I almost
split up two years ago.
He was getting bored, and I could see
he was about to pronounce
our marriage dead,
but then I said, "No."
"No"?
"No." Splitting up wasn't an option.
I had waited too long to find this man.
I wasn't going down without a fight.
So what'd you do?
I changed.
I got a new 'do, new wardrobe.
Franklin liked the new Cindy so much,
he started to change, too.
That's amazing.
You know what? Just sign it.
We have a stamp.
I will go to the tile yard
to see if they have those adobe shingles.
You wanna check on the fabric?
Do you think I fought enough?
Lynette, you're taking marriage advice
from a woman who wants coyote sconces?
I'm serious. Am I giving up
on my marriage too easily?
No! I think you knew when
it was time to call it quits.
That's just it.
I'm quitting,
instead of not taking "No" for an answer.
Look, you and Tom tried to make it work,
and you couldndn't.
Now he's moved on.
And you are an amazing woman
with your whole life ahead of you.
So take off that wedding ring.
Go live it.
Hey, Gaby, do you have a minute?
Oh. Now's not really a-a good time.
Why don't we talk tomorrow?
Oh, please. I don't know
who else to turn to.
Susan won't return my phone calls,
and when I went to Lynette's,
she pretended she wasn't home.
Yeah. Okay.
How did things get so bad so quickly?
This morning, I was all set
to make food for poker night,
and then I remembered.
No poker night.
I feel like I've lost the life I had.
First, my family and now my friends.
Who knows if Susan or Lynette
will ever speak to me again?
They'll cool off once
they realize we're in the clear.
What if we're not in the clear?
What do you mean?
The body's 8 feet under dirt and concrete.
No body, no crime.
I know, but... well...
Chuck came by yesterday.
Chuck? What did he want?
Oh. Hey.
Babe, do we have any aspirin?
Yeah.
Um... are you feeling better?
Is he...
I thought he stopped drinking.
Me, too.
Oh, Gaby, I'm so sorry.
He keeps saying it's because of work,
but I know it's the guilt
still eating away at him.
I just don't understand
how drinking helps.
I do.
Sometimes a drink feels like
the only friend you have left.
Well, I just thank god
this ordeal is behind us.
We all need to move on.
You're right.
I'm gonna go.
You never told me what Chuck wanted.
Oh. Uh, what else?
He wanted to get back together again.
Oh, god. Please tell me you said no.
Of course I did.
Oh, and, Bree?
Never think you lost me
as a friend, 'cause...
you're my rock.
Oh! Hey, Marilyn.
Oh, Mrs. Solis, thank god.
I've been trying to reach Carlos,
and it keeps going to voice mail.
Oh, it's okay. No need to bother Carlos.
I'm here to sign the payroll.
This isn't about the payroll.
Frank Sweeney,
one of our biggest clients...
he's on his way here,
and he did not sound happy.
I'm gonna try Carlos again.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait. I, uh...
I don't wanna stress out Carlos.
He's home with the flu. Besides, I'm here.
How does that help?
I know Frank Sweeney.
He grabbed my ass at the Christmas party.
Actually, a lot of guys did.
That was a good party.
Yes, it was.
Leave this guy to me.
I know I'm setting women's
lib back 20 years,
but I can do this.
So, Frank...
it's been forever.
When's the last time
we've seen each other?
Uh... I'm not sure.
I am.
♪ Jingle bells, jingle bells ♪
♪ Jingle all the way ♪
I-is Carlos coming in?
I really need to speak with him.
Well, aren't you all business?
Ooh, and all muscle, too.
Does Carlos even know I'm here?
I mean, if he doesn't take
an $80 million account seriously...
No, no, of course he takes it seriously.
What are you doing?
In my modeling days,
we called this "The money-maker."
Well, now it looks like a neck spasm.
Look, where is Carlos?
I don't know what kind of
business he's running here,
but if he thinks he can pawn
his clients off on his wife...
No, no, no, no.
We understand you've
been a little unhappy,
and we... want you to
know you've been heard.
I haven't said anything yet.
Knock, knock.
Mr. Sweeney, sir.
Heard you were in the building.
Just wanted to make sure you
were being taken care of.
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt.
No, no, please, interrupt,
whoever you are.
Geoffrey Mathers. Senior account manager.
I understand you have some
concerns about the market.
I do have three or four
real-world solutions
to protect your money in this economy.
That is, if you'd like to hear them.
Actually, that's what
I came in to talk about today.
Well, of course it is.
I was just getting to it.
But, uh, seems like Geoffrey
here has a handle on things,
so, please, join us, Geoffrey.
Have a seat, sir.
So I noticed you aren't
using derivatives...
That was fun. I like Felix.
I thought you were annoying
when you were cheerful,
but this smugness is much worse.
Oh, why would I be smug?
Just because he called me the young you?
Guess that makes you the,
uh... ooh, old you.
He can be a touch theatrical.
I wouldn't take his praise too seriously.
Oh, I would.
I think this time I may have
laid it on a little too thin.
I have not been this excited
since I discovered Andre doing
caricatures at The Pier.
They weren't caricatures.
They were images of
the american grotesque.
Uh-huh, and if you bought two,
you got a free churro.
I am not surprised
he didn't tell me about you.
I'm sure he saw you in his rearview mirror
gaining on him,
and it scared him to death.
Why would a professional
like Andre be threatened by...
Oh, what did you call me?
"A silly, bored housewife
unburdened by talent."
You are a housewife?
Mm.
I love it!
You're like a-a sexy,
suburban Georgia O'Keeffe...
without all the pesky vaginas.
I can sell the heck out of
this story at my gallery.
What? Uh, wait.
You wanna show my painng in public?
Welcome to the big time!
No, no, no, no. That, uh,
no, that can't happen.
My dear, do you understand
what an opportunity this is?
Hundreds of people will see your work.
I'm sorry. I'm-I'm-I'm flattered,
and, uh, thank you for your offer.
Um, but I can't.
Artists.
My pleasure, Frank, and I'm serious.
You call me anytime.
Yeah, Frank, great talking to you.
Ohh. Thank god you got here.
I was 30 seconds away
from flashing him a boob.
It was nothing.
Carlos has done a lot
for me over the years.
Is he okay?
Yeah, yeah. He's just got the flu.
Really?
'Cause he usually comes running
the second Sweeney pops into town,
and I don't think
the flu would keep him away.
Mrs. Solis...
your husband has been like a father to me.
I really wanna help if I can.
Okay.
He's been going through a rough time,
and, well, he's been drinking a lot.
So he's gonna be staying home
for the next week or two,
trying to pull himself together.
That poor guy. Well, don't worry.
You go home and you take care of him.
I'll take care of things here.
Really?
Just get him better.
We need him back.
Thank you.
You're a good kid. And you know what?
I'm telling Carlos you deserve a raise.
Can you tell him when he's sober?
Yeah. Yeah.
Lynette Scavo?
Yes. Wow. These are beautiful.
Someone must be thinking of you.
Have a good one.
Thanks.
Who sent flowers?
Just your aunt Renee.
That was nice.
Right?
A little unexpected, but very, very nice.
Hey, honey, how was your day?
Daytime TV sucks.
Just a bunch of women
sitting around, talking about menopause
and things they don't eat anymore.
You did record that, right?
Yes.
So how'd it go at the office?
Took you a long time to sign the payroll.
Well, it wasn't just that.
People were asking where you were.
So what'd you say?
I told them you had the flu
and you were very comfortable staying home
because you had a great staff,
which you do, by the way.
Yeah, who'd you talk to?
Bunch of people.
Um, Steve, Marilyn, Geoffrey...
Geoffrey?
Right.
Guy probably started doing
cartwheels as soon as you left.
What? Why would you say that?
He's a snake.
Well, you mean like a... a nice snake.
No, like a backstabber.
His contract's up at the end of the month,
and I'm not keeping him on,
so he's trying to poach
my biggest clients.
Wow. What a day.
I really need a drink.
Hon...
You threw out all the booze
when I quit, remember?
Oh, please, there's a bottle of chardonnay
in the tank of the guest toilet.
It's like you don't know me at all.
Lynette, it's me!
Come on in!
♪ Ta-da ♪
Oh, my god. Look at your hair!
Do you like it?
Is it permanent?
No.
Then I love it!
Especially if it means
you're finally ready to put
yourself out there again.
Not so much out there as...
back there... with Tom.
Oh, Lynette.
Stop it with that.
He's moved on.
Then why did he send me
flowers for our anniversary?
"Love always, Tom."
Well, I don't get it.
Isn't he seeing Jane?
Yeah, but... maybe with
the anniversary coming up,
he started thinking about it
and... he wants to give it another try.
What are you gonna do?
Well, I got Penny's keys
to his apartment, and...
Oh, I get it.
He gets home. You meet him at the door
wearing nothing but
whipped cream and a smile.
No. I'm gonna put a bottle
of scotch on his nightstand.
That is our anniversary thing.
He sends me flowers, I give him scotch.
Oh, now I get it.
You get him all liquored up,
and then you undress him.
No, Renee, no sex.
Okay, I don't get it.
I was thinking maybe
he sees the outfit, the hair,
and he realizes I've changed,
and then... maybe he wants to change, too.
Are you sure that's what you want?
All I know is we have been
walking away from each other
since this thing started,
and this is the first time
he's taken a step toward me.
I think I have to take a step, too.
Well... you look... amazing.
I hope it works.
Thanks. I do, too.
And if it doesn't,
I know this really hot thing you can do
with a dinner mint and a feather.
No sex.
How are we even friends?
You're an idiot.
And that's why
you're not getting any coffee.
Susan, hanging your paintings in a gallery
is a major opportunity.
Listen to me.
I consider myself a mentor to you.
What? You have insulted and discouraged me
since the day we met.
What else does a mentor do?
Okay, fine, you got me.
I don't care about you. I care about me.
You came over just to tell me that?
I teach to support my painting.
If one of my students does well,
maybe I can teach at a better college,
like one that doesn't have a major
in air conditioning repair.
Look... if you taught me anything,
it's that the only gallery that matters
is the one in here.
Was that a tuesday?
Because I drink at lunch on tuesdays.
I made those paintings for me,
and no matter what you say,
I'm not sharing them with anyone.
You're scared.
What?
You're afraid of being judged.
Yep.
You're right.
I'm a big, old scaredy cat,
fear of rejection, never felt good enough,
blah, blah, blah.
Happy? Bye-bye.
So did you get me the paintings?
No, she still won't do it.
But you know what they say.
Some are born great.
Some achieve greatness,
and others have greatness
thrust upon them.
Looks like it's time to start thrusting.
If you're spying on me,
you're not very good at it.
Oh, I thought I was pretty
good when I followed you
to the gardening store on Euclid.
And that stop you made for frozen yogurt...
our little secret.
Isn't stalking illegal?
We cops like to call it surveillance.
Stay. I'm not done with you.
This guy... the one you say
you don't remember seeing.
You think you might
remember seeing his car?
His car?
Yeah.
A silver ford focus,
just like the one you and Gaby
were dropping back to her aunt Shirley
The day I pulled you over.
What are the odds?
I'm sure it's just a coincidence.
You wanna hear another coincidence?
The missing guy's from Oklahoma city.
Wasn't Gaby's aunt a big fan
of the Oklahoma city RedHawks?
I don't know what personality deficiency
causes you to act this way,
but I feel compelled
to inform you how utterly
unattractive it makes you.
Fine. You don't wanna answer my questions?
Maybe Gaby does.
You leave Gaby out of this.
Carlos has been sick.
She has her hands full.
Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that.
Well, I'm patient.
I can talk to her later.
Bree...
I've been a cop for a long time,
and I can always feel when
I'm getting close to the truth.
You wanna hear a wild guess?
If it would allow me
to get on with my day,
I would be delighted.
Something happened with this guy...
something bad and permanent.
Now I don't think you did it,
but I think you know who did.
It's probably one of your friends,
and you, being Bree, are protecting them.
I do protect my friends,
and I would do anything
for them... anything.
They're the one thing in
my life that have never failed me,
and I will never fail them.
And against that, you are powerless.
Now I am tired of your little
guesses and your games,
so if you wanna charge me with something,
I suggest you take out your cuffs.
If not, you get the hell off my street.
You scum!
Oh, not you, Mr. Sweeney.
Good to see you again.
Mrs. Solis...
We're sort of in the middle
of something here.
Yeah, I know.
You're in the middle of
stealing my husband's client
while sitting at
his desk in front of a photo
of his wife and kids.
Wait a minute. That's not me.
That's me and my girlfriend...
in Belize...
with our dog.
What kind of man puts his
photos on another man's desk?!
Or takes his dog to Belize?
I'll tell you what kind of man...
the kind that shows up for meetings,
unlike your husband.
I told you, he's got the flu.
Gaby, I think Mr. Sweeney
deserves to know the truth.
Fine. I'll tell him.
Carlos is a drunk.
He isn't here because he drinks too much
and he's unable to perform
the responsibilities
that come with the job.
You know what?
Carlos will get sober,
but you will always be
just a... lowlife son of a bitch.
Is this true?
Yeah.
I need to speak to him... right now.
Carlos, Carlos, wake up.
Wake up!
Mm, babe, I was just dreaming about you.
You were wearing that little black number.
Carlos! Mr. Sweeney's here.
What?
Hello, Carlos.
Mr. Sweeney.
Mr. Sweeney...
Yeah.
In our house.
And I'm in pajamas, covered in chips.
He knows what's going on.
I'm sorry.
Um... look, I am, uh, really sorry.
I had a rough couple days,
but I'm fine now. You can count on me.
You see this?
14 years sober.
But there was a time when I was standing
right where you're standing.
The only thing that got me back together
was admitting I had a
problem and going to rehab.
No, uh, that's not where I am.
I mean...
I know it looks bad,
but trust me, I'm fine.
Hmm, well, you can tell yourself that.
But it's time for you to make a choice.
Either throw away everything
you've worked for,
including your family,
or take back control of your life.
Honey, I think you should go.
I know a great place... the place I went.
I can call tomorrow and get
everything set up for you.
It's gonna be okay, sweetie.
I'm sorry. That waiter was
totally flirting with you.
He was not.
Oh, please, he kept asking
you how your potato was.
I mean, look, it's a potato.
How many ways can it go wrong?
Jared was just being attentive.
Oh, oh, now it's Jared.
I didn't realize you two
were on a first-name basis.
You know what?
I like seeing you jealous.
I'm not jealous.
He just spent so much time at our table,
he should have split the bill with me.
Jealous...
Nah. Jared only got to bring you a potato.
I...
got to bring you home.
Oh, stop! Stop! Stop,
stop, stop! I'm here!
Oh, my god.
Lynette! What the hell?
Oh, my god!
I'm sorry!
What is she doing here?
Yeah, what are you doing here?
I didn't... I didn't think... I wasn't...
I think she's on a bender.
No, no! I just...
What? You just what?
Okay.
Why don't I give you guys some privacy?
As ironic as that sounds right now.
I'll be at Chloe's.
Please tell me this is
the first time you have done this.
I just wanted to bring you
your scotch, you know?
For our anniversary.
Anniversary?
Yes. I got the flowers you sent me.
Oh, my god.
What?
You... remember 12 years ago
when I forgot our anniversary?
I felt so awful,
I placed a standing order at the florist.
I wanted to make sure you
got flowers every year.
Oh, god.
I'm so sorry.
No. No. Honest mistake.
It w-will never happen again.
I am canceling it first thing tomorrow.
Okay.
I'm going to go.
Lynette?
Your hair looks nice.
Thank you.
You made it.
Oh, Felix was nice enough
to invite me to the opening.
It's the least I could do.
Susan, that's art.
Sorry.
There's a lot of people here.
Yep. And before the night's over,
I believe they'll all
be talking about you.
What?
I did something,
and you're gonna thank me for it.
Oh, my god.
Oh, my god, oh, my god, oh, my god.
You're welcome.
What did you do?
Well, you seemed so terrified
about displaying your work.
I figured I'd rip off
the band-aid for you.
And see? You're a hit.
Don't forget who made you.
Sweetie, can I help you?
Nope. Don't mind me. I'm just...
adjusting the...
That is really stuck on good, huh?
What are you doing?
Andre submitted these without my consent.
They were meant to be private.
I really want them back.
Oh, jeez! How many screws
have you got in there?
Stop it!
The only way they're coming
down is if somebody buys them.
Felix, please, please give them back.
No one can see these!
Oh, you are clever.
Creating a scene like a crazy artist.
There is not a person in this room
who isn't looking this way.
You're a genius.
No! No, I'm not a genius. I swear.
I just need the paintings!
Keep it up. Keep it up.
I'm gonna grab the photographer
from the "Sentinel."
The crazier, the better.
Oh, her mind has snapped. Oh!
Stupid art!
Bree, it's Susan. I know
we're not talking right now,
but I really need you... and Gaby..
and your checkbooks.
Susan, this isn't art.
It's an illustrated confession!
It's like a kid's book.
"Meet Dick and Jane. See Jane kill Dick."
"See Jane bury Dick. Run, Jane, run!"
Oh, I swear I didn't know.
He just took them out of
the classroom and put them up.
Well, we have to get
them down immediately.
Hello, ladies. Are you enjoying the art?
Yes, so much so, that we would like to buy
this whole series of paintings.
And take them home with us.
Immediately.
Uh, ordinarily, I would place
a-a sticker on the work that says "Sold,"
and then I would contact
you when the show's over.
Yeah, well, you heard the lady.
We gotta have these paintings,
and we gotta have 'em now. So how much?
Well... oh. Well, if you're
gonna buy the whole series,
I suppose I can trim
a little off the price.
$10,000 should cover it.
$10,000 for my art?
I mean, seems a little steep.
Yeah. She painted my kids
a mural of monkeys playing soccer
for a bottle of wine.
Fine. We'll take 'em.
Congratulations, Mrs. Delfino.
You are officially sold out,
thanks to this lovely lesbian couple.
Oh, we're not...
You know what? This is not the time.
Oh, we'll start pulling the pieces down.
I'm so sorry.
Tomorrow I'm back to
monkeys and squirrels.
You bought these?
Yep. They're ours, so stop looking at 'em.
You really have a good eye.
Yes. They're so powerful.
It's clearly an allegory
for the bludgeoning
and burying of the middle
class in this country.
Oh, I don't know.
All I see is four women who
killed a guy with a candlestick
and dumped his body in the woods.
But then again...
what do I know about art?
Chuck, you followed me here?
Why would he be following you?
Yeah, what's going on?
I'm just trying to get a little culture.
Susan, you painted these?
Y-yes.
Bravo. They are... amazing.
I-I mean, this one, for example,
I me, I'm-I'm getting
shivers just looking at it.
And... is it me...
or do those women look familiar?
And the short one kind
of looks like you, Gaby.
And, uh, there's you, Susan,
and your friend Lynette,
and pretty one with the red hair...
well... who else but Bree?
It's a work of art.
I'm sure it's open to interpretation.
No, I'm pretty certain it's you.
What I can't figure out is...
who's that?
Susan, you painted it.
You can't tell me who that
dead body might represent?
Bree?
Any theories?
Maybe a certain...
missing person from Oklahoma?
Okay, what the hell is he talking about?
I am this close to putting this together,
but you know what?
I think I'm gonna take my time,
because I want to enjoy
watching the ice princess melt.
Bree?
What is he talking about?
Alejandro... somebody reported him missing,
and Chuck thinks we're connected.
Oh, god.
Is that why he was at
your house the other day?
Yes.
But I asked you about that.
Why didn't you tell me?
'Cause you're going through
such a hard time with Carlos.
I didn't wanna burden you.
God, Bree. More secrets?
What did you think you were doing?
I was protecting you.
I've been protecting all of you.
Ever since that night,
I am the one trying to
keep this thing together!
Yeah, well, great job.
There's the woman of the hour.
How do you feel?
I never wanted people
to see these paintings.
I feel...
miserable.
Then congratulations.
You're finally an artist.
Yes, there comes a time when
we must expose our weaknesses...
when our secrets can no
longer remain private...
when our solitude can
no longer be denied...
when our pain can no longer be ignored...
but sometimes we feel so alone...
that a weakness
we thought we'd overcome...
suddenly becomes too strong to fight.

Renee confronted Lynette.
Look, you and Tom tried to
make it work, and you couldn't.
Now he's moved on.
Carlos agreed to go into rehab.
I know a great place. I can call tomorrow.
Susan's secret work of art...
No one can see these!
Fueled the detective's suspicions...
All I see is four women that killed a guy
with a candlestick
and dumped his body in the woods.
And drove a wedge between friends.
More secrets?
What did you think you were doing?
I was protecting you!
Yeah, well, great job.
Whenever Bree Van De
Kamp was feeling low...
she found solace in the act of baking.
When her first husband passed away,
she made coffee cake.
When her second husband went to jail,
she made sugar cookies.
And when her teenage
daughter got pregnant,
she made crème brûle.
So when Bree's best friends
stopped speaking to her,
she hoped that her warm cherry scones
might thaw their chilly relationship.
Susan.
Hey, sweetie. Is your mom home?
Uh, no. She's at... church.
On a thursday?
She told you to say that, didn't she?
Only if it was you.
If it was the priest,
I'm supposed to say
she's reading to the blind.
Will you stop pounding?
I just put Paige down.
I'm sorry, but no one will talk to me.
Really? I wonder why that is.
Look, I have made a mess of things,
but I want to make it up to you all.
You really think you can bake
your way out of this one?
Of course not. It's just a peace offering,
a way to begin the conversation.
I have nothing to discuss with you,
not after the way you and Gaby lied to me.
Lynette, please understand.
I was only trying to protect you,
all of you.
No! You were trying to control us
the way you try and control everything.
That's not fair.
You told us that as long
as we trusted each other
and stuck together,
everything would be fine.
It will be. As long as
we have our friendship,
they can't do anything to us.
Don't you get it? There is no us.
There is no friendship. Not anymore.
You're on your own.
We all are.
Yes, Bree had always
taken comfort in baking.
But when baking failed her,
she took comfort in something else.
In a place as peaceful as Wisteria lane,
the smallest crime can prompt
a call to the police...
When a neighborhood kid
makes a reckless mistake...
when children need to
be taught a lesson...
when the teenagers next door start a band.
Yes, the women of Wisteria lane
were used to calling the police.
What they weren't used to was
having the police... call them.
So... what's going on?
Not sure.
No one's talked to us yet.
Do you think we need a lawyer?
I don't know. Maybe Susan
can paint one for us.
Lawyers won't be necessary, ladies.
This is not an official investigation.
It's just a... it's just a casual
conversation among friends.
But if you want to bring lawyers into it,
I can open a case file,
take your fingerprints.
No. No. We like the friend thing.
Great. So the first friend
I'd like to talk to is... Susan.
Try my coffee.
The guys are always
complimenting me on it.
Thanks. I'm trying to
cut down on caffeine.
Gets you all jittery and nervous?
Yeah. I hate that.
So you feeling jittery
and nervous right now?
What?
N-no. Absolutely not.
Uh, yum.
My compliments.
Why'd you paint this?
Uh, why?
It's... hard to say
why artists... paint what they do.
Gosh, that probably sounded so... artsy.
No, not really.
I would imagine it's even possible
that the artist herself doesn't
really know why she did it.
Sometimes you say to yourself...
"Where the heck did that come from?"
"Maybe I shouldn't have eaten"
"that pepperoni pizza before bed."
Or maybe you say to yourself,
"I feel so guilty about what I did."
I-I-I don't...
I mean, who... who is that?
The guy in your painting.
The one in the grave.
No.
Uh, uh, no.
That came from my imagination.
Bull. It's him.
Ramon Sanchez.
A missing person from Oklahoma.
I don't know anything about that.
That isn't a painting, Susan.
It's a guilty conscience
trying to find peace,
but it never will, ever...
until you tell the truth.
So you've never seen this guy before?
You already asked me that,
and I told you. No.
You know something, Lynette?
You'd have made a good cop.
You know how to stay cool,
keep your emotions in check.
Listen to me.
You women are good people. I know that.
But you're obviously
covering something up.
Now forget about me being a cop, okay?
Let me tell you something as a friend.
A jury will forgive
a lot when they understand
why something happened.
But first, you have to stop lying.
I'm not lying.
How much more of a toll
are you gonna let this thing take on you?
What does that mean?
It means that whatever it is you've done,
it's clearly the reason
your husband walked out on you.
Sorry.
But you said to forget you were a cop.
Huh. Look at that.
What happened to keeping your cool?
Recognize him?
Sorry.
You wanna look at it for
two seconds before you answer?
I got nothing.
Can I go?
He's a person, Gaby.
He has two kids,
not much older than yours.
Two girls, who may never
see their daddy again.
I don't know him.
Now may I leave?
I have a lot of things to do.
Oh, yeah? Like what?
Visiting your husband in rehab?
I heard about his drinking.
I'm sorry.
Yeah. Well, the good news is
it looks like we nipped it in the bud.
Oh, it's a new problem?
Yeah. Why?
Usually there's a trigger
when somebody starts abusing
alcohol out of the blue.
Anything come to mind? Anything stressful?
He...
he had an affair.
Carlos?
That's hard to believe.
I know, right? I mean,
who would cheat on this?
I meant because he seems
like such a good man.
Well, he's not. He's a cad,
a philandering S.O.B.,
but I love him.
So if I go there tomorrow
and ask Carlos that same question...
he'd give me the same answer?
You bet.
Great.
I might just do that.
I'll have another, please.
Okay.
You got a friend who can drive you home?
No.
Turns out I'm friendless at the moment.
But don't worry. I'll take a taxi.
You ladies sound like you're having fun!
What's the occasion?
Just, you know, girls' night out.
Left the kids and husbands at home.
Whoo-hoo! I'll drink to that.
Yeah.
Amen to that, sister.
I mean, who needs families
when we've got girlfriends?
Am I right?
I'm sorry. Who are you?
Oh, where are my manners?
Bree Van De Kamp.
I heard you all carrying on, and, well,
really, I've been feeling
a little disconnected lately,
and I thought, "Bree,
a little human contact is"
"just what you need."
Uh, yeah, Kelly just had a baby,
and we haven't seen each other
for a while, so we were hoping...
A baby! Oh, that's wonderful.
Well, we need to celebrate.
Bottle of champagne!
It's on me.
So how do we all know each other?
Well, these two I know from college,
and you I know from randomly
sitting down at our table.
God, I miss this.
And then one day,
you wake up and you realize
you've got nothing.
Nothing.
Your children abandon you.
Even the gay one.
I mean, aren't gay men
supposed to be obsessed
with their mothers?
As far as relationships go, forget it.
Two of them left me.
Three of them are dead.
And all of this I could bear as
long as I had my girlfriends.
But now they've abandoned me, too.
Everything I touch...
everything I love...
Well, on that note,
I think I'll call it a night.
Same here.
Wait. It's barely midnight...
Awfully early for four
single gals like us.
We're all married.
You don't have to rub it in, Lynette.
Stop calling me Lynette.
It's really creeping me out.
Wait. I've got an idea.
Why don't you all come back to my place
and we can have a sleepover?
Good night.
No. No, please... please come home with me.
I-I have a really big house
with lots of empty rooms and...
Okay, lady. You want me
to call you your cab yet?
No.
I'm just gonna finish Lynette's champagne.
Ben.
Hello.
How you feeling?
Fine. Why do you ask?
You don't remember last night, do you?
Of course I do.
Really? What do you remember?
I went out to dinner
with a few girlfriends,
came home, and went to bed.
Uh, close.
You knocked on my door
at 2:00 in the morning
to borrow money,
'cause the cab driver wouldn't take
the fried zucchini you had in your purse.
Then you cursed at me for
not making you pancakes
before you stumbled back to your house.
How long you been off the wagon?
A few days.
I'd appreciate it
if you wouldn't tell anyone.
It's just a temporary relapse.
I'll get it under control.
Look...
isolating yourself is only
gonna make matters worse.
You got a great group of friends.
Reach out to them.
I can't.
We're not on speaking terms right now.
Well, I'm sure you can fix that.
I tried.
But they all seem to hate me.
Well, my recommendation?
Start with the one
who hates you the least.
Oh. Not ready for that.
It's a beautiful day.
I'd hate for you to waste
another one with a hangover.
Thank you, Ben.
See ya.
I know Chuck could tell I was lying.
I always do that thing when I lie.
Wh-what thing?
Oh, like I'm gonna tell you.
You have no idea how terrifying it was.
Look, have a drink. It'll calm you down.
I don't want a drink.
Really?
Of course I want a drink.
See? I'm a terrible liar.
Look, if Chuck had something
concrete, we'd know.
I'm sure he's just fishing.
He is not gonna let up.
He is just waiting till I crack.
Honey, you're panicking over nothing.
The body's gone.
Chuck doesn't have a case without it.
No, the only way this thing
blows up is if somebody talks.
Are you not listening to me?
I talk. Me.
I'm the one who's gonna send us away.
We need to get out of town,
just for a few weeks,
until Chuck finds someone
else to focus on.
Not only would that look
incredibly suspicious,
we don't have the kind of money
to do something like that.
Okay. Money.
We need money.
We can have a garage sale.
Grab some chairs. I'll put up some flyers.
Trust me.
We're gonna stay here,
and everything is gonna be fine.
Wow.
You're an even worse liar than I am.
Oh. Hello.
Excuse me. Hello?
Someone is never gonna finish "The help."
What can I do for you?
I need to speak with my husband,
Carlos Solis.
Is it an emergency?
No. I just need to tell him something.
Then I can't allow you.
Mr. Solis is still on restricted access.
What does that mean?
Uh, first week after admission,
no visitors,
cell phones, or e-mails. No distractions.
We only want our patients
to focus on getting better.
Okay, but I really need to talk to him.
I'm sorry.
Those are the rules.
Well, rules are made to be broken.
I'm sure there's a
"No boobs on the counter" rule, too.
Seriously?
Male nurse.
Right.
You can come back on Tuesday.
It's all my fault!
It wasn't your fault.
I should've seen the signs.
It was mine. I was never around.
Kid didn't have a role model.
We're getting you help, Jimmy.
They're gonna take care of you here.
I don't need this place.
I told you. I don't have a problem.
Manzani. We called.
Admissions is right through that door.
Thank you. Come on.
It's gonna be all right.
We should've seen this coming.
Jimmy, we're only doing
this because we love you.
Such a tragedy. So much potential.
All right, gotta go.
Excuse me.
Where are you supposed to be?
Oh, uh, I'm with them... the Manzinis.
If you're with the family,
you need to stay for group counseling.
Oh, I don't think
I have much to contribute.
It's vital.
This way.
Come on, Tom.
I know you're there.
Fine. I'll get in another way
and pound on your door until you open up.
Yes?
Hola.
My name is Maria.
I forgot the keys to Mr. Tom's casa.
Could you let me in, por favor?
There's no Mr. Tom here.
You have the wrong apartment.
No.
I am doing the cleaning for Mr. Tom.
Wow. Impersonating a maid stereotype.
Pathetic much?
Oh, Chloe, look,
I know your mother and my
husband are leaving for Paris.
I just need to talk to
Tom for five minutes
before they head to the airport.
They left an hour ago.
Who's there?
I got it, Ms. Schoenfield.
This is Ms. Schoenfield.
Do you know what flight they're taking?
It's really important I talk with Tom.
He's not picking up his phone.
Jeez, stalk much?
Come on. Come on. I'm not a stalker.
Seriously? My mom told me
you were hiding under his bed
while they were in it.
So I'm certainly not going to help you
sabotage her trip to Paris.
Listen to me. Something
happened yesterday.
And I can't go into it,
but Tom needs to be here...
not for me, for the kids.
Please. Please.
Fine.
I've got their flight
information upstairs.
Thank you.
It's clear Jimmy feels conflicted
about whether or not he belongs in rehab,
but his loved ones...
all of you in this room...
are here because you care
deeply about helping him.
So let's start by sharing with Jimmy
the ways his drinking
has impacted your lives.
Mrs. Manzani, go ahead.
Well, actually, can I go first?
I have somewhere I need to be.
Who are you?
I thought you worked here.
No. No. No. I am...
his girlfriend.
Ex-girlfriend, you know,
since all the problems started.
Girlfriend?
Another thing you didn't tell us about.
She's not my girlfriend.
I never seen her before.
Yeah. That's the problem right there.
You know, how can you have a relationship
when your boyfriend drinks and
doesn't even remember you?
Why are you wearing a wedding ring?
Oh...
'cause I moved on.
That's right, Jimmy. You had to hear it.
I seriously had you for a girlfriend?
You are smoking hot.
Yeah, I am.
Oh, my god. I do have a problem.
I was with someone like you.
I don't even remember it.
Mom, pop,
I want to get better.
Oh, Jimmy!
That's the spirit, Jimmy!
Now there's a lot of people
in here just like you
who can help you,
like, uh, like Jason Hurwitz
and Peter Morton and
Carlos Solis, room 247.
Okay. Good luck.
Gaby, what are you doing here?
Are the kids okay?
Yeah, the kids are fine.
I just needed to talk to you.
What's this? You don't
lift a finger at home,
but here you vacuum?
This is my group task.
Recovery here is based
on two core principles...
responsibility and total honesty.
Okay. Great.
Come in here. I need to
talk to you about a lie.
So when Chuck asks what
made you start drinking...
and I'm guessing he will...
say you cheated on me.
With who?
It doesn't matter.
Someone ugly. Don't go overboard.
So...
Chuck saw Susan's paintings,
he's questioned each of you,
and you think this one lie
is going to throw him off?
He's got nothing else.
Gaby, let me tell you
something about cops.
What you think he knows is about
one-tenth of what he does know.
We have got to stop this guy.
God, this is a hell of a time
for me to be stuck in here.
No, honey. Hey, hey,
it's gonna be fine, okay?
You just focus on getting better.
I'll try.
Okay, well, I should get out
of here before they find me.
Tell the girls I miss 'em?
They miss you, too.
Mr. Bergman, hi. Uh, remember me?
Remember you? Susan Delfino,
you sold five paintings
20 minutes into your first art show.
You are my prodigy.
Are you here to revel in your glory?
Actually, no, uh, see, I'm...
uh, kind of in a rough spot right now.
Oh, dear. You seem a bit agitated.
You're not considering jumping
off a bridge, are you?
But if you are,
could you please leave behind
a large body of work for me to sell?
No. Uh, it's just, um...
I need the money from
my paintings, please.
Oh. I just started on the paperwork.
You should receive a check in uh,
four to six weeks.
Oh, no, no, no. I-I need it now.
I, um...
Have to get out of town for a while.
My housewife just got
even more interesting.
Are you a junkie?
Gambler?
Are you on the run from the mob?
I can't tell you what it is.
I just really need that money.
Well, here's the thing...
um, I am having a teensy
bit of a cash-flow problem.
But I assure you,
eight to ten weeks...
I thought you said four to six.
Okay, not so teensy.
Mr. Bergman, I wouldn't ask
if it wasn't really important.
No, I will see what I can do,
but no promises...
my mysterious little housewife.
That's nice.
What's that for?
Oh, you were right.
A hug should be for something,
like the one I saw you
giving Bree this morning.
What was that for?
Oh, Renee.
That was nothing.
Oh, so you're just going
door-to-door giving hugs?
What, is that an australian thing?
Look, there is nothing
between me and Bree.
She's just going through
something right now.
I was a shoulder to cry on.
Oh, as long as that shoulder
isn't a gateway body part.
Oh, I'm sorry to interrupt.
I only need a minute.
I just have to ask you
a couple questions about your girlfriend.
So ask me.
I'm standing right here.
Not you. Bree.
Funny.
We were just talking about
your girlfriend Bree.
Good-bye.
Renee...
Why the hell would you do that for?
I don't know.
Just trying to make your life miserable.
Oh, and I got more.
I'm tracking down a missing person.
It turns out his last phone signal
came from somewhere on
your construction site.
I don't know anything about that.
Doesn't matter. Still a great
reason to shut you down.
How long?
Two weeks. Maybe a month. I don't know.
Oh, let me guess...
as long as it takes for me
to lose my investment, yeah?
That sounds about right.
You're not getting on that
property without a warrant.
Oh, jeez.
Where would a detective get one of those?
See you Monday.
Oh, my god. This tastes so good.
I know. It reminds me of the first time
Lynette and I ever flew first class.
We had been so used to traveling coach...
Tom?
Yeah?
Please don't take this
the wrong way, but...
you're on a romantic trip
with your girlfriend.
Do you think it could
just stay the two of us?
I'm sorry.
Old habits.
That is the last time
you'll hear of Lynette.
To Paris...
ma chrie.
Good. Stay close with that mop.
Flight 502 to Paris will be
boarding in five minutes.
I'm gonna run to the men's room.
It's a long flight,
and airplane bathrooms freak me out.
Well, there goes one fantasy.
Hey, Lynette.
What the hell are you doing here?
I need to talk to you.
I can't believe you.
You think I want to chase you
down in an airport men's room?
Now listen to me.
I can only breathe through
my mouth for a few minutes.
Well, you can save your breath,
'cause I am going...
I am going to Paris with Jane,
and I'm sorry if you're
having a hard time with it.
This isn't about you and Jane.
Look. See? Good with it. Okay?
Okay, good. Then-then why are you here?
Because you can't go to Paris, not now.
Okay, I'm confused.
You don't care if I go to Paris with Jane,
but you're telling me
I can't go to Paris with Jane.
I'm sorry. I have to tell you something,
but it's just really hard to say...
I'm sorry, but my plane
is boarding. I have to go.
I'm an accessory to murder.
Here. Let me help you with this.
I think you've helped enough.
Gaby, please. I can't stand this anymore.
Can't we talk for a minute?
To be honest,
after what Chuck put me through,
I'm kind of talked out.
Wait. What do you mean?
He interrogated us... me,
Lynette, and Susan.
He called us down to the station
and grilled us one by one.
Why didn't he call me down there?
Good question, given
this whole thing is about you.
What are you talking about?
Bree, he wants revenge.
He wants to bring you down,
and we're all gonna go down with you.
Gaby, please.
I will figure out a way
to make things better.
No, you won't.
This isn't gonna stop
until Chuck is stopped.
Say something.
Why didn't you tell me this?
I wanted to, a hundred times,
but we weren't together anymore,
and it seemed wrong to drag you into it.
Tom?
Plane's boarding.
You've got to be kidding me.
Jane, I'm sorry.
I know what this must look like.
Really?
You know what it looks like
to walk into a men's room
and find your boyfriend's
ex chatting him up
before your flight to Paris?
It's not like that.
Of course not. I'm the crazy one.
You two rendez-vous-ing
in an airport toilet?
I'm the nut job.
She's hiding under your bed?
Jane's the one who needs to be sedated.
Tom, I really can't deal with
this right now. Can we just go?
You are not doing this to me right now.
We will go at the end of this month.
I promise.
Jane. Jane, it's really not Tom's fault.
Tom...
honey...
you know what she's doing, right?
You give in here, now,
it'll never stop.
I am so sorry.
It... but...
there are extenuating circumstances.
Okay.
Then tell me.
Tell me what they are.
I think I at least deserve that.
Okay.
I'm going to Paris,
and if you want, you can meet me there.
I'm so sorry.
Lynette, don't.
Just...
don't talk.
Oh, my god! You brought it.
Now before I give it to you... oh,
well, that never works.
What I was going to say...
I have a little proposition for you.
Oh, calm down. It's not sex.
Dang it.
I believe you have that certain something
that makes a great artist.
Maybe it's talent.
Maybe it's mental illness.
All I heard was "Great artist."
Keep going.
Fairview is not the fertile
ground required for you to grow.
I think we need to move your skinny
little tush to New York City.
Move? Uh, no.
I just need to get away for a few weeks.
I'll set you up in an apartment.
You paint.
I'll take 50% of whatever I sell,
but let's not get bogged down
in how the sausage gets made.
What about my family?
My son is in the middle of third grade.
New York has the best private
schools in the world.
He can wear a little blazer to school.
Heck, if he can fit into a child's medium,
I can loan him one of mine.
I never really thought
about moving before.
Well, what is keeping you here?
Yeah, not much.
Okay. Think it over.
But if you turn me down, then I'll know...
it's mental illness.
I want to offer you a deal.
A deal?
Really?
Terms?
Whatever I've done...
or whatever it is you think I've done...
you... write it up,
and I'll sign a confession.
In exchange for...
you leave my friends out of it.
Oh, darn.
I was actually interested
there for a minute.
What do you hope to gain
by harassing my friends?
What do you want?
This.
You in pain.
You see,
I could never figure out a way
to hurt you the way you hurt me.
If you had any idea how
much I'm hurting already...
It's not enough. You know why?
Because you're too resilient.
Husbands die, kids leave,
businesses collapse,
and Bree always bounces back.
But threaten her friends?
Please.
You're talking about the people I love.
They're my whole world.
I have nothing else.
You have nothing else?
That's a bad position to make a deal from.
Sorry.
Hey, you remember that deal
I wanted to make with you?
You marry me and I take care
of you the rest of your life?
Maybe you should've taken it.
Hey. You're old and
pretty much housebound.
Have you noticed if Ben's been
"Entertaining" a lot lately?
This is what I get for
not having a pit bull.
I think he's cheating on me.
Ben? No, he-he seems like a great guy.
My ex was a great guy, too.
Ask any stripper in New York City.
Oh, my god! I cannot
go through that again.
I-I just can't.
Renee, I may not be your biggest
fan or... even like you,
but there's one thing
no one can argue with...
you are hot.
Pardon? Look at you.
You're a knockout...
those gams, those curves,
that killer smile.
Basically you're me 35 years ago.
So this is my future?
The point is,
whoever this woman is,
she can't hold a candle to you.
Oh, thank you, Karen.
Now go out there and fight for your man.
You're right. Tonight I will
throw on a little nothing
and make a house call.
Thatta girl.
You know what?
I wish I had known you 35 years ago.
We would've made a hell of a team.
Hey, we still can if the aussie's into it.
Stop packing. We're not moving.
Don't you see how great this is?
Living in New York,
getting paid to paint...
it's an amazing opportunity.
To uproot our family
and move somewhere we've
never lived before?
So we'll go for a few weeks
and see how we like it.
Susan, you do know that if
Chuck wants to take you down,
moving to New York's not gonna stop him.
I know that.
Well, then why would you want to
give up the life we have here,
after all this time?
Because it's different.
Before, all I had to do
was look out that window
and I'd see a true friend...
someone who would do anything
for me or my family, but now...
it's all gone.
You think you're gonna
find that somewhere else?
You're just running.
Okay. So I'm running.
Mike, if I get caught,
I could go away for a lot of years.
So in the meantime,
why not try to live
the life I've dreamed of?
It's not my dream.
And if this is something
that you need to do,
you're on your own.
Hello, Gaby.
Celia, get back here!
Is this a bad time?
Give me that now! Celia!
Chuck, I have 2 daughters under 13.
It's always a bad time.
Yeah, why don't you just step
outside here for a second?
So did you talk to Carlos?
He's obviously ashamed of his affair.
The whoremonger.
But at least he's honest about it.
No. I wound up taking a different
angle on the investigation.
Actually, you were the reason for that.
Me? What do you mean?
Do you remember when
we were talking about this guy?
Vaguely.
I remember it vividly,
'cause it was the oddest thing...
You see, when Susan saw this picture,
she nearly passed out.
And when Lynette saw it,
she willed herself into not reacting.
But you...
you smirked.
That's crazy. Why would I do that?
Same question I asked myself.
So I started doing some
digging into your background.
Turns out,
Ramon Sanchez, formerly of Oklahoma,
is actually...
Alejandro Perez...
your stepfather.
And you never mentioned that.
Oh, come on, Chuck.
You can't even see who...
at this point, I don't think
you should say anything
without a lawyer present.
Wait. Am I under arrest?
Not yet.
But based on this, I have to
start an official case file.
I'm gonna need you to
come down to headquarters
for an interview.
Be there tomorrow at 10:00.
And, Gaby, if you don't...
I'll send a squad car to get you.
Hi. I need to speak with
Carlos Solis immediately.
I'm sorry, but Mr. Solis...
Yeah, I know.
I know you have that
anoying no-contact policy,
but this is an emergency.
Mr. Solis isn't here.
He checked himself out two hours ago.
What? Why didn't you stop him?
He was not in a mood to be stopped.
Ben, are you in there?
I'm wearing leather and I'm getting cold.
Ben?
Bree, no need to call me back.
Just wanted to let you know that
my unofficial investigation's
about to go official.
Be at the station
tomorrow morning at 10:00.
Bring a lawyer.
Just when my friends
needed each other most,
they found themselves utterly alone...
One with the frantic need
to find her husband...
One with the consequences of
revealing a painful secret...
And one with the feeling that
she simply no longer belonged.
But for one of my friends,
the sense of isolation was so complete...
Here you go.
There might be no escaping it.
Continental breakfast runs till 10:30,
but the good stuff's gone by 8:00.
Oh, I don't think I'll be
having breakfast. Thank you.
Suit yourself.
Do you remember how wonderful
things used to be on the lane?
I had the perfect life.
Doctor husband...
two beautiful children...
oh, and such dear friends.
What happened?
How did I lose it all?
Things change, Bree.
I'm so unhappy.
Are you happy now?
I'm not unhappy.

Previously on...
Renee feared Ben was cheating.
And with detective Vance closing in...
Do you think we need a lawyer?
Lawyers won't be necessary, ladies.
Susan wanted to flee.
If I get caught, I could
go away for a lot of years.
Lynette went to tom for help.
You can't go to Paris, not now.
I'm an accessory to murder.
Carlos disappeared from rehab.
He checked himself out
two hours ago.
What? Why didn't you stop him?
My unofficial investigation's
about to go official.
But before he could go public...
Aah!
And Bree decided to end it all.
Bree van de Kamp
had always wanted to live her life
with elegance and grace.
That is also how she wanted to die.
Her plan was to pour herself a glass
of her favorite chardonnay,
put on her most stylish nightgown
and leave behind a note
on embossed stationery.
Yes, Bree had everything she needed
for an elegant death.
Everything except...
Privacy.
Thank you, but I don't need
turn down service.
Come back in the morning.
And you might want
to bring a mop.
Open the door.
Renee?
You have to the count of three.
One...
This isn't a good time.
Two...
Seriously, I'm in
the middle of something.
Where is he?
Who?
Ben.
The man you're trying
to steal from me.
I don't understand.
Do you think I won't hit you?
I once slapped a waitress
because she forgot my croutons!
You are dead.
Renee, please, you have to go.
Ever since we met,
you've been spouting
those Sunday school phrases,
making folks think
you're this grand lady.
Well, I got your number now,
and you are nothing
but a middle-aged skank
in a Nancy Reagan nightie.
Why do you have a gun?
Bree...
I asked you a question.
Why is there a gun
on the table?
No, don't read that.
Bree.
Please go.
Please.
Where you actually gonna...
Oh, my God.
Renee Perry had no idea
just how close her friend
had come to suicide,
and Bree van de Kamp had no idea
just how close she had
come to being hit.

Keeping secrets is a lonely business.
That's why we all search for
someone to confide in...
an ally who will understand...
An advisor we can trust...
A friend who will never judge.
Of course, not everyone you
tell your secrets to...
Will be happy about it.
Hey.
Good morning.
Hey, mom. Look who
didn't go to Paris.
I know. Your dad had to cancel
his trip.
Because some work meetings
came up.
Nice for us, huh?
Hey, if you guys are done,
why don't you go grab
your books?
And I'll drop you off
at school.
Okay.
All right.
No.
Co-conspirators to murder
do not get pancakes.
I know that
this was the last thing
you ever expected
to have to deal with...
Yeah, you could say that.
How could you let yourself
get involved in this?
It's... it's
Gaby and Carlos' mess.
I was... helping a friend.
Oh! Helping a friend.
Because when I'd ask you
to bring my shirts
to the cleaners,
that was always this big hassle,
but burying a body
in the woods...
Hey, would you
lower your voice?
Look, I do not know
what is supposed to happen now.
And what, is Chuck gonna just
show up and arrest you? What?
He told Gaby
that he was starting
a formal investigation
this morning,
s-so... yes,
they could arrest me.
Damn it, Lynette!
How could you let this happen?!
Out of the four, you're supposed
to be the smart one.
Hey, a-are you guys ready?
Yeah, I'll meet you at the car.
All right.
Okay.
I need some support
right now, not a lecture.
Okay, you're right.
I'm sorry.
I will find a way to fix this.
And now the news.
Detective Charles Vance
was killed last night
in Fairview square,
an apparent victim of a hit and run.
The case is currently
under investigation.
Anyone with information,
please contact the Fairview
police department.
How could he just
check himself out?!
As I told you on the phone,
as I replied to your texts,
and as I'm telling you
in person,
this is a rehab center,
not a jail.
Yeah, well, it's not much
of a rehab center
if you let patients out in time
for happy hour!
Please lower your voice.
You'll wake the crackheads.
I'm sorry, but do you have
any idea how worried I am?
My husband has been gone
all night.
I don't know where he is
or what he's been doing.
Look, even if he did
have a relapse,
I'm sure he'll be back soon.
Then we'll call you at home,
so you should go there.
Could you at least
pretend to care?
Not with what I'm paid.
You're making a big mistake,
nursie.
I've got a lot of drunk friends,
and I'm not recommending
this place!
Again, our top story...
Fairview police detective
Chuck Vance is dead
after a hit and run accident
that has left the community stunned.
Detective Vance was crossing lake street
approximately 11:00 P.M.
When he was run down by a dark sedan.
Hello, sunshine.
How you feelin' this mornin'?
Groggy... and nauseous.
Mm. I'm afraid
that's my fault.
I slipped a few sedatives
in your tea last night
and sort of forgot
to say "when."
You drugged me?
I had to make sure
you'd sleep through the night.
Didn't wanna find you
sprawled out
on the oriental
with your wrists slashed.
Spanish omelet?
If you really want to protect
the oriental...
You'll put that away.
Fine. Let me know what
you do like for breakfast,
and I will make that
for you tomorrow.
Tomorrow?
You'll be here tomorrow?
And into
the foreseeable future.
Didn't you see
my Louis Vuitton bags upstairs?
I'm moving in.
No, no, no, no, no.
You... you don't have
to do that.
After what you tried
to do last night,
I don't have a choice.
But I'm fine.
Last night was just
a moment of temporary insanity.
In the light of day,
I feel absolutely...
Did you take the laces
out of all my sneakers?
Yeah, and I also got rid of
all your knives, razors,
pills, cleaning fluid,
and your shower curtain.
How could I kill myself
with a shower curtain?
You can't.
I just thought it was ugly.
Okay. See, this is why
you can't stay here.
You will drive me
absolutely crazy.
Mm. I'd rather see you
in a straitjacket than a coffin.
All right, that's very sweet,
but I am fine now.
It's a brand-new morning,
and I am loving life.
Okay.
Now that you are of sound mind,
why did you want
to kill yourself?
It's complicated.
I'm sure it is,
and I'm also sure
I'm not going anywhere
till I know exactly what made
you bring a gun to that motel.
Renee, please,
this is so unnecessary.
What's wrong?
I... just got some bad news
about your friend, Chuck Vance.
Susan?
Susan.
Can you help me with my bag?
No! No, nobody's helping her
with her bag.
Mike, you're supposed
to be sleeping.
So are you. Where do
you think you're going?
You know where. New York.
I wrote it all on the note
I left on your nightstand.
But I thought...
Looking good, Mike.
I thought we discussed this
last night.
You can't just pick up
and leave like this.
You discussed it.
I waited till you went to bed,
and then I... reconfirmed
my plane reservation.
Well, if you're going,
you're going without clothes.
Mike! Wh...
Can you wait a sec?
It feels like
you've packed for a month.
Three weeks.
Felix set up meetings
with gallery owners,
and then if all goes well,
we can discuss moving there.
I'm not moving to New York.
Why not?
My plumbing business is here.
Well, think how much more
exciting it'll be.
You'll be unclogging pipes
in the big city.
Okay, just stop. This is not
about you becoming an artist.
It's not?
No.
It's about you running
away from Chuck Vance.
Okay. You're right.
I'm a mess.
One more interrogation
by Chuck,
and I will crack like an egg,
and then I'll go to jail
and take half the neighborhood
with me.
I'm sorry.
I can't risk it.
You have to let me go.
Hey. What's going on?
Oh, my God. Chuck's dead?
It was some sort of hit and run.
That's... that's all we know.
So... what happens now?
Nothing. It's all good.
The only person tying us
to Alejandro's murder is gone.
Gaby, he was Bree's boyfriend.
Yeah, and if she'd dumped him
when I told her,
we wouldn't have gotten
in trouble in the first place.
If you're done,
I think it's time
that we ask
the obvious question.
Which is?
Did somebody do this
on purpose?
Oh, my God.
He was murdered?
No! No, no, no, no, no.
It was an accident.
It does seem a bit...
Convenient.
Well, maybe God decided
to answer our prayers
through one of his
drunk-driving angels on earth.
Who are we to question God?
Look, okay, I admit we were
in a lot of trouble there,
but none of us
are that cold-blooded, right?
Could it be someone's trying
to protect us?
Oh, my God. Carlos.
Hey.
Carlos couldn't have done it.
He's still in rehab, isn't he?
Of course he is!
Oh, my God, you guys.
We finally get a lucky break.
Let's just go with it.
We wanted Chuck gone,
and now he's gone.
It's just a coincidence.
Coincidence?
Yes, Bree, coincidences happen,
otherwise there wouldn't be
a word for them.
So, uh, I guess we should just
put this behind us
and... get back to normal.
Sounds like a plan.
Are we good, Susan?
Sure.
Bree?
We all agree this was
just an accident?
If you say so.
Tom?
Tom, I've got big news!
You are not gonna believe
what has happened to...
Bob?
What did you do?
Huh?
You buried a man in the woods?
She was merely helping a friend.
Don't forget that.
You t-told Bob?
Of course I told Bob.
If they arrest you,
you're gonna need an attorney.
Tom, I just found out
that everybody I invited
to my last barbecue
is involved in murder,
and this is water.
Scotch. Coming right up.
You shouldn't have done that.
We don't need a lawyer.
We have to prepare
for the worst, Lynette.
I am not gonna have the kids
visit you behind bars
next mother's day.
No, no, listen to me.
Chuck Vance died last night.
What?
Hit by a car.
Oh, my God!
Was that you guys, too?
No!
Are you serious?
And... and Chuck was the only one
who knew about the...
Yeah.
Okay.
So, Bob...
I guess we're not gonna
need you after all.
But if you want, you can totally
bill me for this hour.
Count on it.
Taking this scotch.
So it's over?
I think so.
Okay, what's wrong?
Huh?
The one man who could have
put us all in jail is gone.
We're home free, but you're
still sitting there,
more depressed than ever.
I'd like to know why.
I don't know.
Are you... upset
that Chuck got killed?
A little.
Not so much.
Well, then why are you
getting all misty?
I don't know.
Why don't you?
Why are you getting mad?
Because we've been riding
this emotional roller coaster
for months now,
and I'm ready to get off.
Well, I'm sorry if I'm not
all giggles and sunshine,
but I am walking around
with a pretty big secret.
So what?
Everybody's got a secret.
Not as big as mine.
I helped bury a body.
And our mechanic does
crystal meth.
Our butcher beats up
homeless guys,
and the librarian's
a nymphomaniac.
The world is filled
with ordinary people
that do nasty things.
So man up or dump the guilt.
Let's get on with our lives.
I know you're right.
Uh...
It makes no sense
for me to be depressed,
and I know Alejandro
was a bad guy.
And he deserved to die.
He did. He absolutely did.
Why are you still so...
I don't know.
But I'll figure it out.
I swear.
Thank you.
Our librarian's a nymphomaniac?
I made that up.
'Cause I always got a vibe.
Let's just eat.
Detective Murphy?
Yeah.
Hi. I just wanted to stop by
and say how sorry I was
to hear about officer Vance.
It's so tragic. Any idea
who could have done this?
Who are you?
Oh, I'm Gabrielle solis.
I met Chuck through his
girlfriend, Bree van de Kamp.
She's a friend of mine.
Woman's a first class bitch.
Who I rarely talk to
'cause of the bitch thing.
Ahem. So, um, were there
any witnesses?
Everyone here knows
what she did to Chuck...
led him on and then broke
his heart like it was nothing.
Can't believe he wanted
to marry her.
Yeah, I know. Marrying Bree
would have been the worst thing
to ever happen to him.
Well, second worst.
So any clues...
anything at all?
Not yet. Excuse me.
Um...
Well, you know what
I think happened?
Drunk teenagers hitting
people with cars.
Yeah.
It's a rite of passage
with them, like spring break.
If I were you guys,
I'd be checking the grills
of every acne-covered kid
within a 100-mile radius.
It wasn't an accident.
It wasn't?
There were no skid marks,
no attempt to slow down
or swerve.
Whoever did this
was gunning for Chuck.
So... anyone get
the make of the car
or... race of the driver?
No, ma'am, but we're monitoring
every body shop in the state.
Oh. Okay.
Don't worry.
A cop was killed.
We'll find
whoever's responsible,
and when we do, they are
gonna pay, big-time.
Okay.
I'll be sure to tell Bree.
That bitch!
How's the history project
coming?
Good. I'm drawing a picture
of Lincoln's assassination.
Um... sweetie, I don't think
he was shot with a stapler.
That's a gun,
and I think we're done here.
Sorry for just dropping by
without calling,
especially with the way things
have been between us lately.
What's wrong?
It's this whole Chuck thing.
Hey, penny, would you mind
throwing those clothes
in the washing machine for me?
Sure.
Thanks.
Come on in.
You don't think
it was an accident, do you?
No.
Who could do something
like that?
It had to be someone who was
trying to protect us.
But that means they would
have to know about what we did.
Who else knows? I mean, other
than the four of us and Carlos?
Well, Susan told Mike.
And I told Ben.
And I told tom.
You told tom?
Well, you told Ben.
Okay, so Ben and Mike and tom,
but that's it, right?
No one else has been told?
No one.
Except tom told Bob.
We're gonna need
to write this down.
Okay, the people who were there
are in orange.
The people who were told
by people who were there
are in blue,
and the green arrows represent
who told whom.
Wow. We may be good
at arts and crafts,
but we suck at conspiracy.
What's the purple
question mark?
That's whoever wrote
the letter.
You think they killed Chuck?
Who knows? We're not sure
why the letter was sent
in the first place.
"I know what you did.
It makes me sick.
I'm going to tell"?
Sounds like a threat to me.
But why kill someone else
who has the same goal?
It doesn't make any sense.
None of it makes any sense.
I mean, we know these people.
None of them would commit
a cold-blooded murder.
Oh, God.
What if someone else knows?
Hey. How are the girls?
Juanita demanded ice cream
for lunch.
What'd you say?
She's bigger than me.
What do you think I said?
And don't give me that look.
You said you'd be home
by feeding time.
Sorry. I've been all over town
looking for my husband.
Carlos went A.W.O.L.
from rehab last night,
and I have no idea where he is.
Want a hint?
You know?
He dragged his can upstairs
about two hours ago,
drunk as a Red Sox pitcher
in the bottom of the 9th.
Karen, I don't know how
to thank you.
I'm on a fixed income.
Let's use our imagination?
Oh, thank God!
I was so worried!
Where were you last night?
You can tell me the truth.
I won't judge.
I'll be totally supportive.
Wake up,
you pathetic boozehound!
Where the hell were you
last night?!
Oh, where am I now?
Ohh! I'm home!
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Open your eyes. Focus.
Okay, after you checked yourself
out of rehab,
you got in the car.
Where did you go?
I drove to a bar.
I drank a lot of shots...
And I don't remember much else.
Do you remember
killing someone?
Huh?
Oh, look who's sober now.
What are you talking about?
Chuck Vance
was killed last night
by a hit and run driver.
Chuck's dead?
And you think I did it?
Well...
You think I killed someone?
Ahem. Alejandro.
It's not like potato chips,
Gaby!
You were upset,
and you were drinking.
He was hit on lake street.
That's only a few blocks
from the rehab center.
I don't remember.
You have to.
The police are all over
this thing.
They're looking for witnesses.
They're trying to find the car.
Oh, wait. That's it.
The car.
All we have to do
is check the car.
If you hit him,
it'll be obvious.
Honey, where's your car?
That's a really good question.
Why did you turn the light on?
I'm checking up on you.
How you doing?
Fine.
Really?
'Cause last night
you were suicidal,
and that was before
you found out
your boyfriend was dead.
I would think you'd be
an emotional mess
right about now.
It's been an interesting
couple of days,
but I'm holding my own.
See, here's my problem.
I don't believe you.
You don't have to believe me.
All you have to do
is turn off the light
as you leave the room.
Bree, you need to talk
about this.
Repressing your feelings
is not healthy.
And since when
are you a therapist?
Uh, excuse me.
I took intro to psych
and once slept with my shrink.
I think I'm qualified.
Well, as impressive
as those credentials are,
my feelings
are not your concern.
They became my concern
when I caught you
about to swallow the business
end of a Smith & Wesson.
Now I'm not leaving this room
until you tell me why.
I can't.
Other people are involved...
people that you know.
Well... I can keep
my mouth shut.
Renee...
Oh, you can trust me.
We're friends, right?
Not really.
Not really?
I'm not trying to be rude.
Yes, I mean, we're...
well, we socialize.
You've been to my home.
I've been to yours.
We're friendly,
but that doesn't
make us friends.
Okay.
You know what I mean.
You and I don't talk
about important things.
We've never had
a deep conversation.
We're not...
Friends.
And now I've upset you,
and that wasn't my intention.
Don't worry about me.
I'm fine.
And by the way,
I don't think you have
any friends.
In fact, I don't think you care
about anyone at all,
because if you did,
you never would have considered
splattering your brains
against the wall
of some cheap motel.
Okay, that's it. Would you
please get out of my house?
No! Not until I'm convinced
you are no longer
a danger to yourself.
I will not allow anyone
to kill themselves,
not on my watch.
I will not go through that
again.
This is a funeral.
You have got to stop smiling.
Sorry.
I'm just so relieved.
I really thought
I was dead in the water there.
Yeah, we were very lucky.
Listen,
I can't thank you enough
for everything you have
done for me.
It's no big deal.
One minute you're boarding
a plane to Paris,
then the next,
you rush to my side.
Well, you do know
in spite of everything,
you still mean the world to me?
If I didn't before, I do now.
Hey, I-I know it's not Paris,
but you wanna come over later
for movie night with the kids?
That'd be great.
I'll bring a pizza
so you don't have to cook.
Fantastic.
Lynette.
Sorry.
Here you go, dear.
Oh. Thank you.
I can't believe I forgot
to bring tissue to a funeral.
Oh, you keep it. I don't
really cry at funerals,
not anymore.
No?
No. Well, when you're young,
death always comes
as such a shock,
as if the universe is unfair.
But when you get to my age,
you realize that death is just
the end of the story.
The phone call comes.
You shed a few tears,
and then you get together
and celebrate
the life that was.
That's it.
What?
Thank you so much!
You will never know
how helpful you've been.
Oh, I'm so glad.
Were you close with my nephew?
Oh, no.
Oh.
Ah. But he did
interrogate me once.
He did a lovely job.
Hey, Gaby,
have you got a minute?
Listen.
What was Alejandro's alias?
Seriously?
We're talking about this here?
Chuck told me
in my interrogation,
but I can't remember.
Pablo? Paco?
Ramon Sanchez.
Right, right,
and he was living in...
Oklahoma city.
What do you need this for?
I... w-wanna light
a candle for him,
and I thought I should know
all of his names.
You only light candles for
people who you want to bless.
That's right,
and he was a bad guy.
I'm gonna go blow out
that candle.
What the hell
are we doing here?
There are cops everywhere.
It's a cop funeral.
What'd you expect? Clowns?
I am taking a huge risk
by being here.
No,
you're paying your respects.
That's what innocent people do.
Okay.
If I'm so innocent,
then why is that cop
staring at me?
Just stop acting so guilty.
He takes one look at your face,
and you say...
Hi, officer.
Hello. Carlos, right?
Remember me?
No.
I'm not surprised.
You were pretty wasted
when you came into the station
the other night.
You went to the police station?
Yeah. He said he wanted
to make a confession...
something about beating somebody
with a candlestick?
Oh, Carlos, you shouldn't
have done that.
What else did he say?
Well, that's when the news
came in about detective Vance,
and, uh, all hell broke loose.
By the time things settled,
he was gone.
So who's this person
you assaulted?
Oh! Uh...
That would be me.
You?
Yeah. I'm a bit
of a handful.
You hit your wife
with a candlestick?
He hit me back.
In his defense, I'd just
popped him with a baseball bat.
So do you wanna file charges?
Or do you?
Oh! We're good.
This thing we got
isn't pretty, but it works.
So who was it?
Who was what?
The person
you knew who committed suicide.
That's something I only
discuss with friends.
It was my mother.
She'd tried it once before.
Pills.
But I found her in time.
And then... one morning I saw
that look in her eyes again.
Not... sad, just...
Empty.
She swore to me
she'd be fine, so I...
I went to school.
And by the time I got back...
Well...
How was I supposed to know
she was gonna pull it off
this time?
Oh, Renee, I am so sorry.
Yeah.
That's what the note said...
"I'm sorry."
That's it.
I don't have a mom
for the rest of my life,
and she thinks
those two little words...
Are gonna make up for that?
Many years ago,
a neighbor
and a good friend of ours...
Took her life.
And that left us all
heartbroken and perplexed.
But somehow, when I was
alone in that hotel room,
I forgot about all the pain
she caused.
In those awful moments,
I thought maybe
she had the answer.
But then you showed up.
Thank God.
You will always be
the person who saved my life.
And now that I've had time
to think about it...
I realize that makes you
the best friend I'll ever have.
Hey! Look who's here
with a pizza and a DVD.
Ooh, Mario's.
That's excellent.
Mom, you let dad pick out
the movie?
Hey, my taste in movies
is as good as my taste in pizza.
Great, that means the pizza's
gonna be black and white
and three hours long.
Oh, excuse me.
"Citizen Kane," "Marty,"
"Casablanca"...
what do all these movies
have in common?
We fell asleep during them?
They're classics.
"Here's looking at you, kid."
Here's looking at my iPhone,
dad.
Hey! Be nice.
I'm sure your dad picked out
something really fun this time.
What'd you get?
"Old Yeller."
Oh, tom, you make this so hard.
Why? What I've seen of it
is great.
My folks always sent me
to bed before the ending.
Is there... is there
swearing or something?
Eh. Something.
How about we eat?
Huh.
Everything good?
Yeah. It's just, you never
remember I like the thin crust.
But it doesn't matter.
Thank you for getting it.
Who's hungry?
Mmm.
Oh, I am.
Good news.
The police found the car.
You left it
in their parking lot.
Thank God.
Mrs. McCluskey's gonna drive us
over there after breakfast,
then I will drive you
back to rehab.
Sounds like a plan.
Babe.
I'm sorry about all this.
I know I've put you
and the kids through so much.
I'm gonna try and get back here
as soon as I can.
You forget about us.
You just worry about
getting better.
I can hold down the fort.
No problem.
I have something else
I need to tell you.
What's that?
I love you.
I know you know that.
I just don't think
we say it enough.
I love you, too.
One more thing.
What?
If you ever go
to the police again
and confess something
without talking to me first,
I will be burying
another body in the woods.
You got it?
Good.
I'll see you in the morning.
Hey, you want a beer?
Oh, you got the Belgian kind?
I love that stuff.
I know.
Thanks for clearing the table.
I believe that has been
the hardest part
of our separation.
God, for me?
It's the laundry.
I-I found out I am more
inclined to buy new socks...
Ah.
Than to wash the dirty ones.
Hey, thanks again
for giving up your trip.
It really meant a lot to me.
No problem.
And please apologize to Jane.
She must be furious.
I doubt it.
She's not really like that.
Tom, I know women.
There's a Lynette voodoo doll
being dropped off
the eiffel tower as we speak.
No, it's weird, but, uh,
Jane doesn't hang on to anger.
Ah. Uh, okay.
You don't... you don't...
you don't know her.
She's...
she's very forgiving.
Ah. Fine. Got it.
She's terrific.
Well, I'll give you an example.
She would never criticize
the pizza I brought over.
What?
Well, you had to point out that
I didn't get the thin crust.
I know, I know.
The second I said it,
I realized I shouldn't have.
It just... came out.
Exactly. It's just a...
it's a reflex for you.
You can't help it.
Well...
Maybe that's because
I keep hoping
if I say something enough,
you'll finally hear me.
I mean...
23 years of telling you
the kind of pizza I like,
and it still doesn't occur
to you to get it.
It makes me feel like
I don't matter.
Wow, I didn't realize.
I know.
I shouldn't have
compared you to Jane.
That wasn't right.
That's okay.
She's really good to you, huh?
Then I think
you should go to Paris.
What?
Yeah.
'Cause otherwise,
you'll always wonder
if she could make you happy.
And didn't we say that was
the point of us separating?
Could I still stay
and watch the movie?
Of course.
Susan?
You gotta be kidding me.
Susan, what do you think
you're doing?
Oh, I remember this house.
The half naked guy runs out,
and I don't get my fare.
Here. Huh?
Oh, no, no, put that back.
You'll get your fare this time.
Honey, I'm sorry,
but I have to go.
I-it's all in my note.
What is it with you
and notes lately?
You were asleep when I came home
from the funeral.
Well, if you're taking off
to new York, you wake me up!
I'm not going to new York.
I'm going to Oklahoma.
And now I'm...
Just confused.
Okay, two minutes.
You asked me why
I still feel so guilty.
I finally figured it out.
He got a phone call.
Who got a phone call?
Alejandro.
When we were putting his body
into the ground,
his phone rang.
Do you know what that means?
He had really good
cell phone service?
It means he has a family,
and they have no idea
where he is.
It must be tearing them apart.
I mean, he did
something horrible, not them.
They shouldn't have
to suffer, too.
And what exactly are you
gonna do about it?
I'm not sure yet.
I just know I have to see
if they're okay.
I think it's the only way
I'm ever getting back
to normal.
Well, then I guess
you gotta go.
Hey! Where are you off to?
I'm just...
Visiting some family.
Oh, that sounds like fun.
Well, have a good trip.
It's a lonely business keeping secrets.
That's why we all search for
someone we can confide in...
An ally who will understand.
An advisor we can trust.
A friend who will never judge.
Yes, we all need help hiding
the darkest truths of our lives.
Because as soon as you've
told one secret...
Another is likely to appear.

Previously on...
Susan left town with a secret agenda.
Where are you off to?
I'm just visiting some family.
Well, have a good trip.
Carlos was headed back to rehab.
You just worry about getting better.
I can hold down the fort, no problem.
Tom's trip with
his girlfriend was encouraged.
I think you should go to Paris.
And Bree received another
mysterious letter.
It's always easy to know
who our friends are.
They're the ones who tell us
when we look ridiculous...
or when we're deluding ourselves...
or when we've had enough.
But only the best of friends
will tell you the truth,
even when they know...
What the hell is this?
It will upset you.
That's what I found in my mailbox.
"You're welcome"? I don't understand.
Don't you recognize the stationery?
It's the same as Mary Alice's letter,
and I got it right after Chuck's funeral.
You think this is who killed Chuck?
Well, it's the only logical explanation.
There's nothing logical about any of this.
Don't you remember the first note?
Yeah, whoever wrote
that was threatening us.
Exactly. So now all of a sudden,
this person who "Knows what we did"
and is "Going to tell"
is now killing cops for us?
Doesn't make sense.
Yeah, but the timing.
It is weird.
So what's the deal with us?
What do you mean?
Are we still mad at each other?
I think so.
Okay. Just asking.
Well, what are we gonna do about this?
What can we do?
We don't know who wrote it.
We don't know what they want.
We don't know what they're gonna do next.
Is there anything we do know?
Well... we know who these
letters are being sent to.
What's that supposed to mean?
You're the one who keeps
finding these things.
You tell me.
I don't like your accusatory tone.
Well, I'd use a different tone,
but I'm trying to accuse you of something.
Gaby!
You have to admit, Bree,
there does seem to be a link
between you and
Mr. Creepy letter writing guy.
I don't believe this.
Why else would they keep
sending you the notes?
Why not send copies to all of us?
This is not about me.
And if you two are gonna
just sit there and blame me
for the actions of some
psychopath, then...
I'm just gonna go home.
I say we forgive each other
and just stay mad at Bree.
Done.
Yes, only your friends
will tell you the truth.
So when they warn you
about someone suspicious,
maybe you should listen to them.
Susan Delfino was on a mission,
and she had planned it
down to the last detail.
She brought the proper identification,
she mapped out the correct route,
and she brought plenty
of cash for emergencies.
But the one small detail
she hadn't planned...
was what to do once she got there.
Mike, I've got a problem.
Oh, what's wrong?
You can't find the house?
No, I'm standing in front of it right now.
Then what's the problem?
I have no idea how to get inside.
You just spent an entire day on a plane.
You didn't give this any thought at all?
I was going to, and then I got caught up
in an in-flight movie.
It was about a dolphin
who joins an inner city
water polo team, and...
Susan!
Oh, my God.
This was the stupidest
idea ever, wasn't it?
No, you did this because
you're a good person.
Honey, just leave some
flowers and come back home.
I can't. I came here for a reason.
I have to make sure that
Alejandro's family is okay.
I just need to figure out some
cover story to get in there.
You're a little early!
Oh, couldn't want to take
the first look, could you?
What?
Oh, relax. I'm okay with early birds.
Connie Thomas, Thomas realty.
Officially, the open house
doesn't start for an hour,
but if you help me lay out
the finger sandwiches,
I'll let you sneak
the first peek. Come on!
Mike, I've gotta go.
I'm about to buy a house.
Listen, all I'm asking
for is an extension.
Once I get a model unit open,
these condos are gonna
be selling like crazy.
Hi. What's going on?
Hey, I was sitting over at Bree's,
and I thought... I miss him.
Yeah, I miss you, too.
But I can get the numbers for you.
Hold on. Here.
Uh, did you hear me? I said I miss you.
Uh, that's my girlfriend. Just... j...
Hey. I don't miss people.
I forget them.
I ignore them. I verbally abuse them,
but I am definitely not a
missing-people kind of person.
Can you hang on for a second?
Listen, I love that you miss me,
but I'm really busy right now.
Talk later. Hey, you still there?
Yeah, I've got the numbers right here.
Yeah. Yeah.
Let me tell you what
the man from down under
who will never again be
down under just did to me.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
Oh, god, it's like pulling teeth.
I saw you talking to Gaby and Lynette.
Did they say something to upset you?
I don't want to discuss it.
They suggested botox, didn't they?
No. Why would you say that?
You're having wine before lunch.
That's what I did the first time
someone said I needed botox.
Yes, I am upset, but it's private,
and I wanna process it... privately.
Ohh, keeping stuff inside
is how you ended up
in that motel with a gun.
Relax. I am no longer suicidal.
You don't wanna talk? Fine.
But I'm not gonna let you sit
here for the next few days
moping about god knows what.
We're going out.
What?
I know all sorts of naughty places
filled with all sorts of naughty men.
Be ready to leave by 8:00
and try to wear something
that doesn't scream "Frigid schoolmarm."
No! No, no, listen to me.
I don't wanna go out.
I don't wanna talk about my feelings,
and I don't want you here anymore,
so please...
go home.
Another glass of wine?
It's just, I've never seen you drink.
You know what? You're right.
I could use a night out.
Really?
Yes, but my wardrobe is a bit frosty.
Do you think you could
run back to your house
and find something in your closet for me?
Something sexy.
Absolutely. Oh, Bree, you'll see.
A night out is exactly what
you need to lift your spirits.
I'm tired.
I know, sweetie.
Trying to teach you
the value of hard work.
If you're wondering why
I'm pushing the leaves
over to Ms. Kinsky's house,
it's 'cause I'm trying to teach her
the value of hard work, too.
Mrs. Solis, hello.
Hey... Carlos' secretary.
Marilyn.
Marilyn, of course. Yes. I knew that.
What can I do for you, Marilyn?
I was in the neighborhood,
and I thought I'd bring by Mr. Solis' mail.
Thank you.
By the way,
any chance that tomorrow
he can get out of his...
rehab?
Why do you need Carlos?
He's been trying to land
this british firm as a client for months.
They're in town for a couple of days,
and I think a little wining and dining
would seal the deal.
Well, I don't think it's a good idea to
spring Carlos out of rehab for "Wining."
Isn't there someone else
who can meet with them?
What about the old guy?
Robert? He retired.
Oh. Oh! How about the fat chick?
Celeste? Maternity leave.
The nerve of these people.
Sorry, Marilyn. You win some,
you lose some, right?
Except in this case,
we're losing a $90 million account.
$90 million?
And you think all it will take
is a little wining and dining?
Why don't you go ahead
and set up that meeting?
I have an idea.
Okay, I'll get right on it.
Do you know why the owners are selling?
That's a bit of a scandal.
I really shouldn't say.
Okay.
The husband disappeared four months ago,
and he hasn't been heard from since.
I think it's drugs or maybe another woman.
Could be anything.
Poor child.
Stepchild.
Oh, but you got the "Poor" part right.
The wife had to take a second job,
and now she still can't
even make ends meet.
Yeah.
Tell the buyers how desperate we are.
That'll jack up the sale price.
Oh. Mrs. Sanchez, so sorry.
I didn't realize you
were coming back so soon.
I bet.
By the way, you dropped some
of your flyers on my lawn.
Oh, I should get those. Excuse me.
It's not completely her fault.
I was sort of... prying.
Sorry.
Are you sorry enough to buy my house?
Oh, well, uh... actually, I was...
looking for something a little larger.
Well, that's too bad.
Maybe, uh, there's something
that I can do for you.
Because... I am a
collector of Americana...
and some of your fabulous knickknacks
have really caught my eye.
I have fabulous knickknacks?
You sure do.
Like-like this, for instance.
Those are Legos.
I know what they are.
But what you don't know
is that these are... phase one Legos.
Very rare.
I would love to buy them
if you're willing to sell.
Seriously?
'Cause I got, like,
a whole coffee can full of those.
That's... jackpot.
Oh! I-I, um, I will take them all.
Hey, Marisa!
What?
This lady's buying all your old Legos.
You still have that box
full of headless barbies?
Oh! Oh, that's okay. I'm good. Uh...
here... is your check.
Oh, I think you added an extra zero.
That's because I...
I wanna do something to help.
You know, because of your... situation.
Look, whatever my realtor said,
you don't gotta feel sorry for me.
I know my husband will come back.
But... on the off chance
that he... doesn't,
please, take my check.
Okay. Thank you.
But stop giving me the sad eyes.
Ramon does this sort
of thing all the time.
He goes on a little bender,
then comes home,
but mostly, he's a good
husband and a loving father.
Well, thank you again.
It was a...
pleasure doing business with you.
You've really helped us out.
Wow, that smells great.
Where'd you learn to make a pot pie?
I looked it up on a little place
you kids call the internet.
This is nice, huh?
Perfect family dinner.
It's doing it again.
No, it's not. Everything's perfect.
It's flickering, mom.
Had to happen while dad
was in Paris, right?
Hey! What's that supposed to mean?
I can handle it.
I'll just do what your dad does.
What does your dad do?
He goes to the circuit box and...
jiggles something.
I can do that.
You know exactly what he
jiggles or... Never mind.
I'll do it.
Anything?
You're making it worse.
Wait, wait.
This is it. This is definitely it.
Well, it stopped flickering.
What time is it in Paris?
No. We are not going to call your dad.
We just need some flashlights.
Where does your dad keep the flashlights?
Boss.
Hi, Mike. Everything okay?
Well, I, uh, I just bounced a check.
Ouch.
and it was to buy bats for M.J.'s
little league team, so...
Embarrassing.
Exactly.
So I called my bank to tear 'em a new one,
and they told me my last paycheck
was returned for insufficient funds...
boss.
Oh. Look, uh...
Let me cover that for you.
I'm sorry about that.
I don't know what could have happened.
I just switched banks.
Maybe there was some kind of
problem with the transfer.
You sure that's it?
I know the condo project's
going a little slow.
Is everything okay?
Absolutely. Nothing to worry about. Here.
Grab the kids a few extra bats.
Oh, no, I don't need a tip.
Uh, just-just my pay.
Did you fix it?
No, but I figured out it's not the light,
so I'm going over the blueprints
to find out where the real problem is.
Or you could just call an electrician.
Why do that?
I went on the internet.
I did a little research.
And other than a few
electrocution stories,
it doesn't sound that hard.
Seems like a lot of work.
All dad had to do was... jiggle something.
You know, the jiggle is just a band-aid.
That was your dad's
approach to everything.
Just patch it up and pretend it's fixed.
That's why we've had these
problems all these years.
The light. I'm talking about the light.
At least the doorbell's working again.
Hey! How are you?
That's the "Hey" that means
"I need something."
No, come on. This is important.
Okay, Carlos is away, and I need
some help with his business,
and you're the only friend
I have who knows this stuff.
What stuff?
I don't know.
Some big british company.
Bennett something.
The Bennett group?
Yeah! See? You get it.
Anyway, they're on the verge
of signing with Carlos,
and since he's not "Free,"
I thought I'd take 'em to
dinner and close the deal.
You? How would you even
know what to talk about?
Hey, that's where you come in.
You used to work for Carlos.
Maybe you can give me a few pointers.
I have spent my life learning
about the world of finance.
I can't just teach it to
you in a couple of weeks.
Could you teach it to
me in a couple hours?
'Cause the meeting's tomorrow.
Gaby.
I'm a fast learner, I swear.
And from what I understand,
the deal's as good as done.
This is just a formality.
Okay. Fine.
Come back tonight after the kids are done.
I'll do my best.
Oh, you're the greatest.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Hey, could you at least bring...
Bring some wine.
I'm one step ahead of you.
I was going to say Carlos' files.
Oh, jeez. Those are at his office,
and that's all the way across town.
Hey!
No.
I don't suppose the bartender
has any anti-bacterial wipes.
You can ask again, but I don't think so.
Will you stop?
The fun of a place like this is
getting germs on your elbows.
I don't understand why anyone
would want to come to a dive like this.
You say "Dive" like it's a bad word.
Look around. People are having fun.
Now look in that mirror, hmm? Not fun.
Why are you so uptight?
Well, compared to you,
a woman who paid for our drinks
by... showing off the Bronte sisters.
The Bronte sisters?
Jeez. Even your boob jokes are repressed.
What happened to you?
Nothing happened to me.
Well, someone made you this way.
Was it your mother?
My mother passed away when I was 10.
Ohh. That explains it.
Remember my mom died
when I was a kid, too.
When parents die,
you can go one of two ways...
Daddy's little girl or
daddy's little nightmare.
Well, I suppose my father did
have certain expectations.
He... raised me to be a lady,
and I've done my best to make him proud.
Mm, hello, repression.
Well, I'm glad that
he insisted on good behavior.
Your dad is not here, Bree.
No one's gonna tell him if you cut loose,
have a little fun.
You look hot in my dress.
Be bad. Be naughty. Hit on a stranger.
I wouldn't take a breath
mint from these people...
As if any of them would have one.
Fine. Sit here alone like daddy wanted.
I'm mad at Ben.
I need to work out those issues
with strange men on the dance floor.
You're gonna leave me
sitting here by myself?
It's a dive, Bree. Dive in.
The main thing that distinguishes you
from a corporate firm
is custom benchmarking.
Let them know you provide
superior customer service,
even though your responsibilities
are not fiduciary.
Ooh, "Fiduciary." I love how that sounds.
Can you spell it for me?
Well, let me explain it first.
No, no, no, no, no.
Your explanations take forever.
Just spell it.
Gaby, you can't write
down a bunch of buzzwords
and read them off a piece
of paper at the meeting.
Good point. I should
hide a piece of paper.
Or you could actually buckle down
and learn the concepts.
It's just fancy lingo.
You throw it around.
You sound smart. Clients are happy.
I mean, who really understands this stuff?
Everybody.
Really?
Everybody? Okay. Hey, Penny.
What is "Fiduciary" mean?
Um, I think it's like someone
who's allowed to manage
to someone else's money... like...
a bank or something.
Okay. Guess who's going
to their prom alone.
Look, can we take a break?
We've been at this for hours.
43 minutes.
Well, it feels like hours.
Just give me a couple more smart words,
and we'll be done.
What happens when they have a question?
You can't just spout off a bunch
of terms you don't understand.
Of course I can.
You think when I was
a spokesmodel at car shows
I knew what rack and pinion steering was?
I didn't have to, 'cause I had charm.
And a tight little dress that
barely covered your hoo-ha.
I wonder if I still fit into that dress.
Well, here's a thought.
How about for once in your
life you apply yourself?
What does that mean?
It means for as long as I've known you,
you have been skating by
on your looks and charm.
For as long as you've known me?
Wow, you've been holding
on to that for a long time.
Tell me I'm wrong.
No, Lynette, I can't.
No one can tell you you're wrong,
'cause you're always right.
Okay. What does that mean?
It means you're a know-it-all.
I have never once heard you
say the words "I don't know."
Well, get ready to,
because I don't know why
I agreed to help you.
This is a complete waste of my time.
It's a bigger waste of my time,
'cause listening to you, time goes slower.
Good luck at your meeting.
Yeah, well, thanks for nothing.
What a fi-douche.
Hello.
Hi.
Oh, lord. I was hoping
you'd take it from there.
I have absolutely no
idea what to say next.
Uh... sorry. Neither do I.
Well, hey, look at that.
We already have something in common.
Hey. You using this?
Well, it looks like we might
have to make a commitment here.
You ready to take that step?
Sorry. I'm afraid this chair's taken.
I'm Bree, by the way.
Bradley.
So what is a man wearing
a custom-made suit
doing in a place like this?
Uh, well, actually, I'm not
supposed to be in a place like this.
I'm supposed to be across
town at the four seasons
attending my high school reunion.
Oh, and you decided not to go.
No, no, I went, for about,
uh, six minutes.
Ah, all these people full of regrets
trying to recapture their glory days.
I was about to blow my brains out.
That sound crazy?
Not as much as you might think.
I sometimes think I married
him just to lose my virginity.
I've never said that to anyone.
I can't believe I just told
that to a total stranger.
I don't know why everyone's so
afraid of telling their secrets.
It's freeing, isn't it?
Yeah, you're right. You know,
I think there's a lot of things
I've been afraid of for no good reason,
like pigeons and cilantro.
Well, I don't have any pigeons
or cilantro at my house.
You know, I'm-I'm sorry.
I-I bet you're too much of a lady
to go home with somebody
you just met at a bar.
Yes, a lady usually likes to know a man
a little bit longer.
All right, that's long enough. Let's go.
It's Marisa, right?
Uh, I'm Susan. I don't
know if you remember me
from the open house.
My mom's inside. I'll go get her.
No, no, um, actually.
I wanted to talk to you alone,
if that's okay.
Why?
I, uh...
I wanna ask you about your dad.
Stepdad.
Stepdad. Right.
He wasn't a very good man, was he?
When your mom mentioned him,
I noticed the look on your face,
and I had this feeling that
maybe there was a problem
between you two.
I don't wanna talk about this.
It's okay.
I know him a little bit, enough to know...
the kind of person he is.
You can tell me.
Did he ever hurt you?
Why?
I know that you just met me,
and this must seem very strange.
But I came here...
because I know what he did.
And even though I can't
take away the pain,
I can promise you one thing.
Your stepfather will never hurt you again.
How can you know that?
I just know.
He is never... coming back.
I promise.
Oh, my, a pool, too?
I wish I'd known. I would
have brought my bathing suit.
This is wonderful, by the way.
Yeah, it was one of my favorites.
I picked it up on a wine tasting trip
through the south of France last summer.
It's got a nice...
Well, I guess you like it, too.
Oh, my goodness. I've never
done anything like that before.
Well, here's to trying new things.
You know what?
I just thought of something
else I've never tried before.
This is so crazy.
I'm in a pool. I'm naked.
And I love it.
Well, get ready to love it even more.
Our very own... floating bar.
You know what?
I just thought of something else
I've never done in a pool before.
Oh, crap.
Did someone just break into the house?
Yeah. Me.
Is someone out there?
What's happening?
It's a funny story. He's my boss.
I'm his assistant.
We need to get out of here.
You're an assistant? Aren't you over 40?
Jeez, you're worse than
those people at my reunion!
Bradley?
Mr. Jacobs, you'll be happy to know
that I have watered your plants
and picked up your suits.
Oh, and your, uh, daughter called.
What the hell are you doing?
I'm sorry. I thought you weren't
gonna be back till Monday.
Oh, you two have a lot to talk about.
Could I trouble you for a towel?
So you thought in the meantime
you could take over my house, my pool,
my pants?!
Speaking of clothes,
I'd love to be wearing some
from that pile right there.
Who are you?
Ooh. Uh, I can assure you,
I never do this sort of thing.
Just get out!
You have a lovely, lovely home.
Whoa, no, we're not
done with that one yet.
Don't know what to tell you.
Lease hasn't been paid,
and I got sent to take it back.
Guy with the funny accent
asked me to wait a half-hour
while he meets with some, uh, bankers.
Mike, hey. Private meeting.
Yeah, do me a favor, bud.
Step back outside.
Are you crazy?
Well, it's just a
stop-gap loan. No worries.
Who is this guy?
Sorry, pal.
The deal's off.
He's not taking your money.
If he's a friend, I suggest you urgently
get the hell out of my face.
Mike, I'm not asking you. I'm telling you.
Mind your own business.
Ben, when you're dead or on the lam
because you can't pay them back,
and trust me,
you will never be able to pay them back...
I'm gonna lose my job.
That is my business.
You can go.
"Mike," was it?
Yeah.
Yeah. Mike.
My whole life, money's been
the boot on my throat, you know?
When I was a kid, when I was
a young guy starting out,
and even now when I'm supposedly
some sort of a success.
Yeah, it's a pain in the ass.
Even Renee, as rich as she is,
still complains about it.
Yeah, yeah, she, uh,
she divorced some athlete
or something, right?
Some athlete? Try Doug Perry.
The New York Yankee.
Oh. Sorry, mate.
If she divorced a cricket player,
I might recognize the name.
If she divorced a cricket player,
she wouldn't have gotten $12 million.
Another?
Uh... yeah.
Yeah, yeah, another.
Well, Gaby, we are very fond of
Carlos and everyone at global,
but help me out here.
How can I tell our board
we're going with your firm
instead of a larger one
with a longer track record?
Four words... "Open-architecture
investment platform."
So as opposed to tightly
controlling our portfolio,
you would open it up to
a number of asset managers.
Isn't that what I just said?
So where do you see
the greatest opportunity for growth?
Five words...
debt management and emerging markets.
Yes, because the I.M.F.
has vowed to support those economies.
We like what we're hearing, Gaby.
Two words... me, too.
Oh. Sorry.
It's my daughter.
Juanita, I'm in a business meeting.
Yes, I have business meetings.
Since now. What do you want?
No, you cannot give your sister a haircut.
Oh, okay. Well, I'll fix it later.
Just don't let her look in any mirrors.
Sorry about that. Where were we?
Well, I was just about
to ask you your opinion
of the long-term viability of the euro.
Ah, well...
Where's my menu?
The waiter took it.
What? Wait.
We haven't even ordered yet.
Oh, the chef is creating
a tasting menu for us.
Isn't that nice?
No! No, no. I... need my menu.
Come on. Gotta be in here.
Reservation under commerson.
Oh. Here. Sit wherever you want.
Is there a problem, Gaby?
No. Uh...
No, no. No problem.
Everything is fine.
Enough business talk. Let's just eat.
Oh, no, I love this stuff.
In fact, I am going to pick
your brain for the entire meal.
Yay!
So you were just about
to tell us your feelings
about the future of
a unified european currency.
Fiduciary.
Hey, how was practice?
Coach is an idiot.
You still can't fix it?
Well, I'm sure I could, but you know,
I'm starting to like it that way.
Gives the place ambiance.
Mom!
Like a flickering candle.
Mom?!
Can you come up here?
Yes, honey?
What did you do?
I was trying to fix the
light in the kitchen.
And now my wall has
a huge hole bashed in it?
Hey, hey, don't get all high and mighty.
There are several walls in this house
That have huge holes bashed in them.
And you thought I wouldn't notice
if you... covered it
with a unicorn poster?
Well, Parker, you didn't notice
when I was bald from chemo,
so, yeah, it was worth a shot.
Why is there a map of Canada on my wall?
Oh, my god!
I don't wanna see into his room!
It's bad enough hearing
what goes on in there.
Shut up. I'm not the one
who practices kissing
with a stuffed dolphin.
Hey, hey!
Mom, what happened?
I was looking for a thing
called the secondary fuse box,
which is supposed to be in the wall,
but it turns out the
internet can be wrong.
Unbelievable.
Mom, we told you two days ago,
just call an electrician.
No.
No. I have to be able to figure this out.
Your father is gone,
and lots of things like
this are going to happen,
and I need to know how to fix them.
If I had known he was
going to really leave,
then I would have had
him teach me this stuff
while he was still here!
I...
should go get dinner ready.
I'm sorry. I don't have
time for you right now.
I'm on the phone.
I don't see a phone.
Yeah. It's just my boyfriend.
She'll call you back.
I'm sorry.
And no matter how busy I was,
I should've made time for you.
How much did the wine cost?
$115.
Okay, you're sorry.
I gotta be honest.
I was worried you were
losing interest in me.
Lose interest in you?
Renee...
you got everything a man could want.
I'm busy.
Too busy for Bourbon?
Or ice cream?
Hey, we can make a Bourbon float.
Okay. Terrible idea.
I just came to say you were right.
I am a pain-in-the-ass know-it-all,
and I am sorry.
You were right, too.
Bourbon float's a terrible idea.
But an Amaretto float...
It's just so typical.
You came to me for help,
but instead, I gave you a lecture,
and when you wouldn't do what I said,
I kicked you out.
It's okay.
No, it's not.
I have been doing this to Tom forever...
till he got fed up and left.
I really don't want that to
happen with my friends, too.
Honey, I deserved it. You're right.
I do fake my way through life
by batting my eyes and looking pretty.
And the problem is,
I can't do that anymore.
Right. Because you're getting older.
No, 'cause Carlos is gone.
Oh, sorry.
I just have all these responsibilities.
I have to grow up.
Well, he should be back in a few weeks.
What if he isn't?
What if he can't kick this thing?
Then I'm gonna be on my own,
and I am helpless on my own.
And that's why I came to you.
I just wanted someone
to take care of things
so I wouldn't have to.
I wanted you to be my Carlos.
I just miss him so much.
I miss Tom, too.
But at least we have each other.
We're gonna get through this.
How do you know?
Because...
I know everything, remember?
Hey.
You look exhausted.
I am. I was gonna sleep
on the plane, but...
But they had a movie about a parrot
that coaches an inner city debate team?
Hey, I haven't heard that in a while.
It's nice.
Oh, this trip, Mike...
it did what I needed it to do.
Oh, I'm glad.
Yeah.
I think this whole Alejandro
nightmare is finally over.
Please don't cancel the card.
My husband's been out of town,
but I have some money now,
and I can make
the minimum payment tomorrow.
Thank you.
Marry a rich man, Marisa,
because the only thing guaranteed in life
is that the bills will never stop.
Maybe you should sell his motorcycle.
Your stepfather loves that thing.
He'd kill me.
But... what if he never comes back?
Of course he's coming back.
Why would you even say that?
Did he contact you?
No.
Then what?
Tell me.
That woman who bought all that stuff...
She came to talk to me.
It was weird, but
she promised he'd never come back.
How would she know?
That's what she said.
And she seemed pretty sure about it.
Turns out the car was his boss', too.
I had to walk a mile and
a half to the bus stop.
Have you ever taken a bus at
1:00 in the morning, Renee?
It makes you stop believing in god.
Okay, Bree, I get it.
And did I mention that I was soaking wet?
Three times.
Good, because I wanna be very clear
just how your advice worked out.
Can I say something?
I... think you had a blast.
Why would you say that?
I can see it in your eyes.
You're telling me about
this horrible story,
but you love telling it.
That is... ridiculous.
Although... I suppose it was...
a little exhilarating.
Yes, good friends are the ones
who tell us the truth about ourselves.
Look at you. You're a bad, bad girl.
Even when the truth might be something
we're reluctant to admit...
that we still have a great deal to learn...
that we sometimes need to ask for help...
that we may be overlooking
a golden opportunity.
Yes, hearing the truth
can often set us on a different path.
Hey there. Can I buy you another drink?
But we never know...
You can buy me breakfast.
Where that path might take us...
or who might be watching.
Previously on...
Susan tracked down the wife
of the man she helped bury
and tried to make things right.
I think you added an extra zero.
I wanna do something to help.
Lynette adjusted to life without Tom.
Lots of things like this
are going to happen.
I have to be able to fix them.
Mike stopped Ben from making a mistake...
Are you crazy?
Who is this guy?
Sorry, pal,
the deal's off.
He's not taking your money.
Then told him something
he didn't know about Renee.
If she divorced a cricket player,
I might recognize the name.
If she divorced a cricket player,
she wouldn't have gotten $12 million.
And Bree's falling out with her friends
led to some dangerous behavior.
Can I buy you another drink?
You can buy me breakfast.
Bree Van de Kamp had always
enjoyed a sterling reputation.
She was known for being kind to strangers
and for greeting them with a warm welcome.
She made sure every guest felt comfortable
and that no part of her
home was off-limits.
She never had the heart
to turn anyone away,
because no matter how many
guests she was hosting
or how late she was entertaining,
her generosity knew no bounds.
That was amazing.
It was nice.
And unexpected.
An hour ago, when I offered
to buy you that glass of wine,
I didn't know what a good
investment it would be.
I don't waste any time...
when I see something I like.
Decisive.
And sexy. You may be the perfect woman.
Get out.
What?
I mean... it's time to go.
Uh... it's... it's...
it's 4:00 in the morning.
Yeah, and my neighbor, Karen McClusky,
starts her day at 5:00
with a pot of coffee
and a seat near her front window.
This is my only chance
to get you out of here
without her noticing.
Who cares if she notices?
I do. I have a certain
reputation on this street,
and I don't want to become
the subject of idle gossip.
Now come on.
Well, uh... thanks again.
This-this was terrific.
Ah, yes, here are your pants.
Thanks. Uh, really love to see you again.
Aw, that's sweet.
Don't forget your jacket.
It's quite chilly out tonight.
I'm serious. Let's do this again.
How about Friday?
Oh, I'm afraid I'm busy.
Thursday or Wednesday?
Can I at least get your phone number
or your last name?
You seem like a good person,
so I'm gonna be honest.
I have no interest in having
a relationship with you.
Why not?
Because I am past the point in my life
where I hope every date will flower
into a meaningful relationship.
I have had husbands and boyfriends,
and they've brought me nothing
but heartbreak and pain.
So now all I want is a body
in my bed at night, briefly.
So that's it?
You're just gonna kick me out?
I am so sorry. Where are my manners?
Yes, Bree had always enjoyed
a sterling reputation...
It was lovely having sex with you.
Have a wonderful day.
And she saw no reason that should change.
In the life of every housewife,
there comes a time for renovation...
when an eager child learns a new skill...
when a romantic evening
becomes an unsightly mess...
or when a dinner party
comes to an unexpected end.
But sometimes the only thing
that needs to be removed...
is a memory.
So basically I want a whole new look...
new furniture, new paint, you name it.
So we can get rid of everything,
including the Virgin Mary and her kid?
Ah. No, no, no, no.
My faith is very important to me.
Name three apostles.
Okay, fine. Move it to the guest room.
Hey, can you guys get this
all done in two weeks?
Probably.
Why the rush?
That's when Carlos is done with rehab.
I don't want him coming
back into the room.
It just freaks him out.
Why would this room freak him out?
'Cause it was where Celia was conceived,
and frankly, that kid's
been nothing but trouble.
Uh, so, Lynette, is Tom back from Paris?
Not yet. Jane arranged for them...
to pop over to London for a couple days.
That slut.
I'm sorry.
No, no, no.
I mean, yeah, she's a slut,
but I'm done feeling sorry for myself.
It's the kick in the pants
I need to start dating again.
Good for you.
Yeah, it's a big step.
I know, which is why I'm hoping
you two might know someone
you could set me up with.
Uh, sure. We will think about it.
What was that?
What was what?
What was that look thing you just did?
Oh. There it is. You did it again.
It... Lynette, you're a wonderful person.
You are strong and sexy and smart,
so... fixing you up would
be a bit of a challenge.
Why?
Well... because you're so unique.
Such an original.
Feisty and so certain of what you believe.
Stop trying to make all those
sound like compliments.
You're basically telling me I'm a bitch.
Oh, my god!
We're just saying it takes
a certain kind of man
to appreciate all you have to offer.
Preferably one with a hide like a rhino
and the fighting spirit
of a baby harp seal.
Okay, so we're done sugarcoating?
Okay, look, I've met me.
I know I can come on a little strong,
but I have to believe there's
a guy out there somewhere
that finds that appealing.
And... you two are gonna
help me find that guy.
Ohh, fine. You win.
You always do, because you're so...
feisty.
Oh, my god.
Aah! Oh, my god!
Why are you still here?!
Didn't the alarm go off?
Yeah, 4 o'clock in the morning.
I shut it off.
No. That's when you leave.
That's when all the men leave.
It's the rule.
Okay, I'll get rid of whoever's knocking,
and you can sneak out the back. Stay put.
Yeah, but I have...
And don't move.
Karen, hi.
Th-this is not a good time.
I am so angry, I could spit.
You've gotta help me, Bree.
With what?
The church bake sale.
Everyone knows I make the lemon bars,
but this year, Helen Simpson
says she's making them, too,
and I can't compete with her.
She uses real lemons.
And what do you use?
I'm on a fixed income, okay?
Oh, God!
I mean... that must be so hard for you.
You're the head of the Women's Auxiliary.
What should I do?
Have you considered covering your lemons?
What?
I-I mean, you have lemon bars covered,
so I'm gonna ask Helen to
make blueberry cheesecake.
Okay, thanks.
Now off you go.
I will. I'm just waiting
for the naked guy behind me
to finish getting dressed.
Sorry. Couldn't wait.
I've got a meeting.
Have you seen my pants?
Uh, you left them on the kitchen island.
Don't give me the judgmental eyebrow.
He is a dear old friend of mine
visiting from out of town.
See you later, Dan.
Don. Hi.
Just go.
Now can I give you the eyebrow?
Fine. I met him last night at Murray's.
My car broke down, and I...
I went inside to wait for a tow truck.
And how about the guy I saw
leaving the other morning?
My god. What time are you getting up?
Caught that one on the way to the can.
What is going on, Bree?
You don't seem... yourself lately.
I am absolutely fine.
Okay. Whatever you say.
Come on.
What is your big surprise?
Just a few more feet.
Because if it's a 3-way, I gotta warn you,
that's how I met my ex-husband.
Uh, no, it's not that.
Your fish.
You're getting rid of it?
Well, I know how much you hate it.
Well, it meant so much to you...
for some stupid-ass reason
you once explained to me.
Yeah.
Bruce and I had some good times together.
But you and I have been
having our share, too,
and, uh, you know,
if I have to pick one of you
for the long haul, well...
The long haul? What are you trying to say?
I'm trying to say...
I want you to come to
dinner tomorrow night.
Ah. Sounded like there
was more to it than that.
Well, maybe there is,
but you'll have to come
to dinner to find out.
Sounds intriguing.
We're not having swordfish, are we?
Work.
I will be upstairs.
Keep it short.
Hey, Carl. What's up?
No, no, don't send out the layoff notices.
We'll make payroll. I've got this covered.
No, not the bank.
I'm working on something else.
Claudia.
Where the hell is my husband?
Oh, hey, I'm sorry. The door slipped.
Whoa. Okay. I just vacuumed,
so if you could...
Ramon!
Ramon!
He isn't here. H-how did you find me?
Your address was on the check, genius.
When I find you,
I'm gonna wring your neck like a chicken!
You seem a little tense.
Do... do you want some herbal tea?
I want my husband!
What makes you think I know where he is?
You told my daughter
he was never coming back.
You think it's that easy
to steal my man, bitch?
Wait. You think that
I'm having an affair with Ramon?
Did he give these to you?
No! No! These are from my husband.
So you're cheating on your husband,
too. You whore.
Okay, look, I swear
there is no possible way
I could be having an affair
with your husband. Trust me.
Well, I think you're lying.
And you wanna see what I do to liars?
Hey, mom. Who's that?
Please don't.
You're the home wrecker, not me.
But this isn't over.
I wanna get to the carpet
store before it closes.
Oh, relax. It's a block away.
Just need to confirm my appointment.
Hi. Making sure I'm still
on with Frank 2:00 Thursday,
and reminding you what
happened the last time
you screwed up my appointment.
She hasn't forgotten, Renee.
None of us have.
Hello.
How are you? This is my friend Lynette.
Hi.
Who's the lucky guy doing you?
Actually...
Nobody. My husband and I are separated,
and he just took
his girlfriend to London and...
He was talking about your hair.
Oh, of course you were.
I'm gonna meet you at the carpet store.
Seriously, your hair is amazing.
Any chance you'd ever let me style you?
Uh, well, I've been going to
Gustave on main for years.
I'd feel like I was cheating on him.
Well, he doesn't have to know.
Yeah, but...
Gustave is jealous and french,
and I wouldn't want this ending up
a pistols-at-dawn kind of thing.
Loyalty. Just makes me want you more.
All right. Stop sniffing each other.
I need a bottle of conditioner.
Coming right up.
Well, he seems great.
Why don't you set me up with him?
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
Why not? You saw he was flirting.
Well, no, he's not right for you.
He just got divorced,
and he's not looking for anything serious.
Neither am I. It's perfect.
Honey, you're about to go on
your first date in 20 years.
I really don't wanna see you get hurt.
Don't worry about me.
I'm feisty, remember?
No.
Don't make me use the baby voice.
Oh, not the baby voice.
Pwease.
I even hate when babies
use the baby voice.
Pwease, Wenee,
help Wynette date the big,
sexy hair dwesser.
pwease.
Okay, okay.
Okay. Oh, thanks.
Look, Lynette may be
loyal to her hairdresser,
but she is single.
So maybe the two of...
I'd love to. How about tonight?
Sounds great.
Leave your number with Linda.
I'll call you when I'm done.
Great. Thank you.
To thank you, I will never
again do the baby voice.
Ah, I appreciate it.
But I've still got the british one.
Pip, pip, cheerio,
jolly ol' crumpets and tea,
let's go. Ta-ta.
Oh, my god.
Oh, my god!
Why can't we walk to the bus by ourselves?
All of our friends do.
I'm not trusting you with Celia.
Remember your gerbil?
I was younger then.
I didn't know how to make a parachute yet.
Okay, fine. Go.
Seriously?
Yeah. Walk, run. Whatever.
Quick, before she changes her mind!
Susan!
And that's when I decided
to fly to Oklahoma city
and visit them.
Unbelievable.
And I obviously didn't have $1,000 cash,
so I had to write a check.
With your address on it. Perfect.
And I was hoping that
when she calmed down,
she would realize
we weren't having an affair.
Apparently not.
I can't believe
you would go to his family.
Why would you do that?
I felt so guilty. Oh, it was eating me up.
The guilt again?
You feel guilty, so you assault a cop.
You feel guilty,
so you paint the murder scene.
You feel guilty, so you go to his house?
When is this gonna end?
I just needed to make sure they were okay.
You know, they didn't do anything.
Susan, we were in the clear.
There was nobody who
could connect him to us,
and then you had to go tell his wife...
No, no, no, his widow...
he was never coming back.
I didn't tell Claudia. I told Marisa.
Who the hell is Marisa?
His 15-year-old stepdaughter.
Wait. You talked to her?
Do you think he was...
Well, how do you know? Did she tell you?
She didn't have to.
I've only seen that look in
someone's eyes once before...
yours.
Do you think she's told her mother?
It didn't seem like she told anyone.
She needs to.
Keeping a secret like that...
it just... tears you up.
I'm so sorry. I...
I don't know how
we're gonna get out of this one.
I do.
Call Claudia and tell
her I wanna talk to her.
Who do I say you are?
The woman's who gonna tell her
the truth about her husband.
So... what's your feeling on carpaccio?
My feeling is I'd like to
be locked inside a room
made of carpaccio and eat my way out.
I am so happy to hear you say that.
My ex never let me order anything raw
without giving me a lecture
about the dangers of E. coli.
Ugh. Sexy.
I'm sorry. I shouldn't
be talking about her.
No, it's nice to hear
about someone else's marriage
problems for a change.
Oh, there was no problem,
as long as we did
everything exactly her way.
"Why do you have to
work for somebody else?"
"Why don't you get your own salon?"
I can see how that would be frustrating.
Although...
I suppose someone could argue
that she was just trying to help you.
Help me? By making me feel
like a failure all the time?
Yeah, that is pretty awful.
Although...
maybe she meant it as
a motivational technique.
So you agree with her?
I am just trying to understand
what she might have been thinking.
I mean, you don't wanna be
a stylist forever, right?
Why not?
Because...
who wants to be cutting
hair when they're 60?
I mean, wouldn't you rather be
checking in on your own salon
from a beach in Bali?
I like cutting hair.
Then that is all that matters.
Although...
My goodness, you certainly do work out.
I just love a man with a firm bicep.
You want to feel mine?
Reverend Sykes, what are you doing here?
The more pertinent question is,
what are you doing here?
Well... as you always say,
there's no point in
preaching to the choir.
You've gotta go out into the world
and... try to set
the youth on a different path.
I think your path should
take you elsewhere,
perhaps to one of those ladies
not so burdened down with clothing.
I can only imagine what you must think.
Oh, what I think is,
as Karen McCluskey put it,
"You're back on the yahoo juice."
Oh, that's not mine.
Some poor soul who was here
before me must have left it.
I suppose I have allowed myself
to slip back into some...
old habits.
Well, that's why I'm here,
to keep you from slipping any further,
so gather up your things and let's go.
You must be so disappointed in me.
It's all right, Bree.
I've been your pastor for years,
and you're the most proper
and appropriate woman
I've ever come across.
This is obviously a temporary lapse
and not who you truly are.
How can you say that?
Excuse me?
How can you say who I truly am
when I don't even know myself?
We can discuss this later.
Now come on. Follow me.
But I have been following you for years,
and I am still terribly lost.
I need to find out who I really am,
and I think... maybe the place
I need to search is right here.
You do realize,
if you continue to do this,
I can no longer let you
lead the Women's Auxiliary.
You can't do that.
The bake sale is this sunday.
It would be a disaster without me.
I'm looking at a much
bigger disaster right here.
Now you're just being cruel.
That's not very ministerial of you.
I didn't only come here as your minister.
I also came as your friend.
But clearly, you have no
interest in either right now.
So as you can see,
within two years of opening the salon,
you will have amortized
all the start-up costs.
Uh, we are not ready yet.
At that point, there's no reason
you couldn't consistently turn a profit.
Oh, my god.
Can we talk about something else?
I'm just trying to help.
From what Renee tells me,
people go to the salon because of you,
and yet half that money... your money...
is going to the owner.
Seriously, this is making my stomach hurt.
Could it be 'cause you're scared?
How could you say that?
You know nothing about me.
I know. I know. It's just...
we've spent an hour
coming up with a perfectly
reasonable 5-year plan,
and it just makes your stomach hurt.
You know who else had
a 5-year plan? Stalin.
Okay. Oh, I'm sorry I said anything.
You're happy where you are. That's great.
There's nothing wrong with being average.
I am not average.
I'm sorry. Adequate, settled, comfortable.
Whatever you wanna call it.
Why don't we just order?
Good idea.
Oh, the salmon looks good.
At a steakhouse?
You're right. I'm sure
it's perfectly adequate...
settled, comfortable.
I don't know what Ben has up his sleeve,
but it's gonna be a special night,
so I really wanna look great.
Speaking of which,
how was your, uh, big date with Lynette?
Ah! Little tight.
Sorry.
Oh.
The date was interesting.
I really owe you one.
What happened to your hair?
You happened to my hair.
Frank was the one guy in this podunk town
who knew how to relax
a black woman's hair.
Now I look like an extra from
"Foxy brown."
And thanks to you,
our relationship is ruined.
Wait. Frank did that?
I had no idea our date was that bad.
Oh, really?
Did you or did you not
give him a 5-year plan
on a cocktail napkin?!
Well, I may have made a few
constructive suggestions,
but only because I saw
potential in the guy.
He could really be something.
He is something, and he likes who he is.
He doesn't need you telling
him that it isn't good enough.
I am not going to apologize
for trying to help the guy.
If he can't handle it, that's his problem.
Ah, I see.
So it's his fault
you tried to control him?
Just like it was Tom's fault
you tried to control him?
What did both of those
guys have in common?
Oh, wait. Give me a second.
Uh, I'll think of it.
I'd say put on a thinking cap,
but I don't think there's one big enough.
Well, at least I can cover up this mess.
That one is gonna take
a hell of a lot more work.
Come on. Take off the scarf.
How bad could it be?
You'd be surprised.
I look like a bottle brush.
So what's the big occasion here?
First, a toast.
To the woman who came roaring into my life
like a one-eyed wombat.
Uh, it's a good thing.
A force who makes each day
more exciting and
surprising than the last.
Now... I realize
it's only been a few months,
but, uh...
I found myself falling for you, Renee.
And, uh...
I know a keeper when I see one.
Oh, Ben.
You like it?
I love it.
Yeah?
It's just... it's so fast.
Well, if you need to
take your time, I under...
No, no, I don't need to take my time. Yes!
I'll marry you!
You have made me so happy.
You don't know what you've done for me.
When my... marriage ended,
I felt so betrayed.
I decided I would never
trust anyone again.
And then you came along.
I just feel so safe with you
in a way that I've never felt before.
And I know that...
in my heart this is right.
I can't do this.
What?
Just forget I said anything, okay?
Forget you asked me to marry you?
What? Give me the ring.
You don't wanna marry me, Renee.
I'm an awful person.
You're an amazing person.
Now slide it on right there.
I can't.
Why?
What is going on?
Oh, god. You're gonna hate me for this.
I'm having some financial problems,
and...
I guess I thought if we pooled
our resources, that... oh.
You wanted to marry me for my money?
I know.
I'm sorry.
Look, Renee...
I meant every word I said.
I do love you.
There's really no way for me
to know that now, is there?
Hi, Claudia.
I'm Gaby. Thanks for coming.
Yeah. This one said
you wanted to talk to me?
What about?
We should go inside.
You're not coming?
No.
I'm-I'm gonna wait out here.
I think you two could
probably use some privacy.
It's not usually this messy in here.
We're redecorating.
Excuse me, Mrs. Solis?
Do you have a second?
What-what is that?
Red wine. New year's eve party.
We were playing... smash-the-bottle,
which is a terrible game.
Okay. Uh, we're taking lunch.
Just wanted to give you
a heads-up before we replace it.
Great! Great. Don't need any
reminders of that crazy night.
Can I get you something to drink?
No. You can tell me what
the hell I'm doing here.
Where's Ramon?
Well... how to start this...
First of all, the man you're looking for...
his real name is Alejandro Perez.
What?
No, it's not.
Trust me.
I knew him before he ever met you.
How?
He was my stepfather.
You okay?
I just want all this to be over.
Me, too.
But it's never going to end.
She won't stop looking for him.
She still loves him.
So you didn't tell her?
No way.
She would never believe me.
Did you tell anyone?
No.
Marisa, I'm not gonna
pretend to understand
what you're dealing with.
But I have a friend who
went through the same thing,
and she said that as awful as it was,
keeping the secret only makes it worse.
So if he left you and your mom,
changed his name,
started a whole new life,
why'd he come back to see you?
I had visited my hometown.
I said some things about him.
He heard, and he wanted me to stop.
What kind of things?
Look, this isn't easy for me...
What kind of things?
When I was 15, he molested me.
You expect me to believe that?
I was a virgin, and he hurt me.
Liar.
Claudia.
I know this is hard to hear.
I don't know what you and your friend did.
I don't know what happened to my husband.
All I know is everything
I'm being told is a lie.
It's not! He was a child molester.
Shut up! You can make it
sound as bad as you want.
You can tell all the disgusting
lies you can think of.
I will never believe you.
Then believe me.
What?
I was too scared to tell you.
I know how much you love him.
Oh, my god.
Are you saying...
I kept thinking it would stop.
No. No.
Not my baby.
No.
No.
It is all my fault.
Come in.
You were right.
All those years, I thought I pushed Tom
because he needed me to.
Well, he did.
No, he didn't, and that guy wasn't Tom.
He was just a perfectly lovely guy,
perfectly content with his life
until hurricane Lynette hit him.
At least you recognize it.
They always say that's the first step.
Mm, can I tell you the truth?
There was a part of me that
recognized it the whole time.
A little voice inside my head telling me,
"You like this guy,
and you're driving him nuts. Stop."
But I couldn't.
What if after all these years,
I can't stop?
What if this is who I am?
Remember in college
you used to bite your nails?
You stopped that.
Yeah, by taking up smoking.
Remember how you quit smoking?
Yoga.
I've never seen you more relaxed
than when you were taking those classes.
I don't know.
All I'm saying is
you are the most determined person I know.
You can do anything you want.
I just wanna be different.
I'm sick of being
this hypercritical nut job.
It'll get better.
Trust me. And so will dating.
You will find somebody.
I hope you're right.
I mean, hell, if you found Ben...
I'm joking. I'm joking.
Ben and I...
it's over.
So that's where the tough guy lives, huh?
Can we just do our business, please?
You pay every week, everyone's happy.
You miss one, it'll cost you.
You miss two...
You don't wanna miss two.
Don't worry.
I just have to get past this rough patch,
and then the money will be rolling in.
Take your time.
Besides, if you're not good for it,
I understand that pretty
girlfriend of yours is loaded.
She's got nothing to do with this.
You keep her out of it. You understand me?
There's a lot of tough
guys on this street.
Hi! Come in.
We're not staying.
Just... came to say good-bye.
And thank you.
You sure you don't wanna stay?
I have a guest room.
No, we need to be getting back.
This one's missed enough school already.
Give me a second, mija.
I still don't know how
this could have happened
under my nose.
You must think I'm
the worst mother in the world.
No.
At least you believe her.
My mother never did.
But I'm the one who brought
that man into her life.
You didn't know. Nobody ever knew...
What a monster he was?
I know now, thanks to you.
You said that stain was red wine?
You should probably get rid of that.
Bree, what are you doing here?
Oh, I've been running
this bake sale for eight years.
Why wouldn't I be here?
I told everyone you weren't feeling well
and had decided to sit this one out.
Well, I'm feeling better now.
Besides every bake sale
needs... a tart.
While I appreciate a good
culinary double entendre
as much as the next man,
I really don't think you should
be here in your condition.
I'm fine. Look how beautifully
my dessert came out.
Shortcrust pastry, fresh strawberries...
You've obviously been drinking.
I don't want you to embarrass yourself.
Well, I appreciate your concern, reverend,
but I can take care of myself.
You're very welcome.
Tell all your friends to come to my table.
All right, who's next?
Greg.
Oh, my god. Bree.
Wh-what are you doing here?
This is my church.
Are you a member?
I've never seen you here before.
I, uh, just joined. Yes.
Nice talking to you.
Wait, wait.
Can't I tempt you with a slice
of my famous strawberry... tart?
I, uh, I should probably get going...
What a funny coincidence this was.
Will I see you at Murray's later?
Or... we could just
skip the Murray's part,
and you could come...
straight to my house.
Greg, who is this woman?
Uh, this is Bree.
She, um, she goes to this church.
Doesn't sound like you met her in church.
Excuse me. What business
is it of yours how we met?
I'm his wife.
I guess it is your business.
Unbelievable.
You're always going on about working late
and sleeping in the office, and meanwhile,
you're hanging out at dive
bars picking up trash.
I don't like your accusation.
Oh, yeah? Guess what I don't like?
You screwing my husband!
Bree, this is what I was worried about.
You need to leave.
You're kicking me out?
She's the one making a scene,
and a dry batch of cupcakes,
by the looks of it.
Thanks, but I'm not
looking for baking tips
from the town whore.
Don't listen to her, Bree.
She doesn't know who you are.
Actually, Karen...
I think she does.
Now I know you're all anxious to dig in
to the delicious gossip
I've provided for you.
And I could really use a drink.
Yes, in the life of every housewife,
there comes a time for renovation.
She may be doing away with
an unpleasant memory...
breaking up a once happy relationship...
or making the necessary changes
to prepare for a new one.
But no matter how much a housewife
may embrace the way her life is changing,
the people in her neighborhood
may take a different view.
What's the matter?
Maybe we should, uh, go inside.
Or maybe we shouldn't.
Previously on
"Desperate Housewives"...
I'm done feeling sorry
for myself.
Lynette made an announcement.
I need to start dating again.
But her first attempt...
Oh, the salmon looks good.
At a steak house?
Was a disaster.
The stress of covering up a crime...
You told us that as long
as we trusted each other,
everything would be fine.
You're on your own!
Drove a wedge between
Bree and her friends...
A night out is exactly what
you need to lift your spirits.
Leading her back to an old addiction
and down at very dangerous path.
Being in love can bring
out the worst in people.
They may become stingy...
Or hostile...
Or simply indifferent.
But in the beginning when
love is still a promise,
people bring their best to the table.
Here's to second chances.
Oh, here's to you
for giving me a second chance.
I really... didn't expect you
to be so nice on the phone.
I guess you were charmed
by my groveling.
But now
I'm kind of in a pickle.
I spent the last week
complaining
about the crazy bitch
I went out with.
Now I have to go back
and tell everyone
this is one of the best dates
of my life.
Aw, that's so sweet.
Ah, not so fast.
We haven't had dessert yet.
We still could blow it.
Oh.
I hadn't thought of that.
Well... how about we get
outta here?
We could have dessert
at my place.
That sounds great.
So I have half an apple pie.
I've got some
of those little pudding cups,
and I think there are some ice
cream sandwiches in the freezer.
Oh.
Come on.
Who can resist a pudding cup?
No, I-it's just...
I didn't realize that you
actually invited me over here
for... dessert.
Oh. Dessert.
You thought I meant...
Sex.
Right. That's... why
you ran all those red lights.
I figured you had
a sweet tooth.
Yeah.
So just the three choices?
I think so.
Don't get me wrong.
I love dessert... both kinds.
It's just so soon,
and it's only our second date.
Only the first one
that's gone well...
I get it. No problem.
Plus there's a certain...
Amount of prep work involved
that I would have done
had I known
we were thinking of...
and I didn't make my bed,
and there are no clean towels.
I misunderstood.
And now I've made you
feel uncomfortable.
I'm so sorry.
No.
We had a great night.
Yes.
I look forward
to doing it again.
Oh, yes. Sounds good.
Okay.
Just... please don't think
that this means
I never wanna have sex with you,
'cause you're great,
and... and sex is great.
I love sex.
I always have.
I was a total whore in college.
All right, well, I guess
this is good night, then.
Okay. Good night.
Yes, the promise of love can
bring out the best in us...
Unless we find that we're
a little out of practice.
After a disaster,
every housewife has her
own way of coping.
Some turn to drink...
Some turn to sweets...
And some turn to the people
they trust the most.
So then I said I'd love
to have sex with him,
but I'm not sure I'm ready yet,
and now we're going to have
this awkward thing
hanging over us.
Nobody expects you to hop
right into bed with someone new.
Why not? Tom did.
I'm just trying to motivate her.
To do what?
Have random sex
with the first guy she meets?
You don't wanna be that girl.
Yeah, because that sounds
like too much fun.
Susan, Lynette is pushing 50.
With a very long stick.
Point is, she should be
out there getting some
while she's still limber enough
to enjoy it.
Are you supposed
to be on my side here?
Of course.
First things first...
do you really like this guy?
Yeah, I think I do.
Then what's the problem?
Well, for starters,
I'm a little rusty.
It's been a while.
The last guy who saw me naked
told me not to wait so long
between pap smears.
Oh.
Okay, you're putting
too much pressure on yourself,
and if you really
like this guy,
you should take it slow.
Yeah, but not too slow.
You're starting
a new relationship,
and sex is a big part of it.
You don't buy a car
without giving it a test drive.
So drive this guy, Lynette.
Drive him hard.
So... how much longer
is Carlos gonna be in rehab?
141/2 days.
I don't know.
The first time with somebody
is always awkward and weird.
And exciting and great.
Come on.
In 20 years of marriage,
you never fantasized
about being with someone else.
Constantly. Sometimes during.
Well, here's your chance.
Huh.
I guess this is the upside
to having
your marriage collapse.
Okay. I just have to figure out
how to make my first move.
I know who could
give you some tips.
Oh, my God.
Is that another one?
I know. What happened
to the blond guy from last week?
Blond guy? The guy I saw had
dark hair and a sports car.
The guy I saw
drove a motorcycle.
What is that,
five guys in a week?
Is she starting
a basketball team?
Should we be worried about her?
After the way she treated us,
unh-unh.
She's not our problem anymore.
Who are these women
staring at us?
Nobody I know.
Juanita, why do you insist
on giving out Valentine cupcakes
when I bought you a box
of perfectly good cards?
Store-bought cards are lame.
Who cares? I could be
watching TV right now
instead of trying to cram
the name "Harrison"
onto a cupcake.
I wish daddy was here.
He always helps me with stuff.
You really miss him, huh?
Yeah. Why'd he have to go
to stupid Europe, anyway?
Well, you know, business trips
are very important.
That's why they call them...
Business trips.
But he's never
been gone this long.
It feels like forever.
I know, but when he gets home,
everything's
gonna be great again.
Do you have any more
of those sprinkles?
You're spending a lot of time
on that one cupcake.
Is it for someone special?
No, it's for nobody.
Juanita, what's his name?
He doesn't have a name.
Ha! So you admit he exists.
Fine.
His name is Ryan Vayo.
He's so cool.
He can dislocate his shoulder
so it looks like
he was in a car accident.
Mm. You and me...
we go for the bad boys.
So I just want it to be special.
Do you think that's dumb?
No. I think you need
more candy hearts.
Hey, I've been, uh,
I've been meaning to ask.
Do we have any cereal?
It's for Julie.
For the rest of her life?
When she was a kid,
our favorite thing
was to have cereal dinner.
But I couldn't remember
her favorite, so I got 'em all.
I can't believe
it's been six months
since she's been home.
Yeah. Why the visit?
I think she just misses
her mom.
She sounded a little blue
on the phone.
Well, we should think of
some stuff to cheer her up.
Way ahead of you.
We are gonna do all the things
she loved to do
when she was a kid.
Oh, hey. Do we still have
that trampoline in the garage?
She would jump on that thing
for hours.
I would be up in my room,
reading,
and her head would keep
popping up in the window.
"Hi, mom. Hi, mom.
Hi, mom."
Hi, mom.
Oh! Julie.
Hi. Hey, Mike.
Hey, kiddo.
You look great.
Oh, you do.
You look wonderful.
Can I get you something?
Uh, yeah, sure, some water.
Oh.
Here.
We are gonna have
so much fun this week.
I thought we'd start
at the amusement park
with some high-risk
roller coastering.
Uh... Susan?
And then I am gonna take you
to my kick-ass
kickboxing class.
Yeah... uh, babe?
And to top it off,
Mike is gonna dig out that
trampoline so that you can...
oh, my God!
Yeah.
I don't think we're gonna be
needing that trampoline.
Oh, my God.
You're... pregnant.
Yeah. Six months.
You didn't even tell me
you were in a relationship.
Oh, God.
Is there something wrong
with the guy?
I'm gonna hate him, aren't I?
No, 'cause...
You're not gonna meet him.
It was just kind of
a casual thing,
and he's not really interested
in following through.
I was right.
I do hate him.
And you're okay with that?
Mm, yeah.
Yeah, I am.
Then we are, too.
Of course.
And we are gonna be here
for you.
You can move back home,
and Mike and I will help
take care of the baby.
Oh, my God. I can't believe
I didn't even ask.
Is it a boy or a girl?
It doesn't matter.
I'm giving it up for adoption.
What?
No, you're not.
Mom, look at my life.
I-I live
in a crappy apartment.
I'm working part-time
while I finish my PHD.
But you always said
you wanted children.
Yeah, with a husband.
I'm not in a place
to do this right now.
No, no, no. Slow down.
We need to think this through.
I already have.
And I'm working
with this agency,
and they set up a meeting
with a great couple
who doesn't live
too far from here.
Oh, God.
I'm supposed to meet them
tomorrow night,
and they wanna meet you, too,
to learn about my background.
So that's why you came home...
not just to break my heart.
Okay, well, guess what?
No one is meeting anyone,
and no one is going to
give away this baby.
Susan.
Mom, you just said
you'd be there for me.
I really need your support.
Please?
Okay, I'll do it.
We'll have them over for dinner.
Thank you.
Happy sucky Valentine's day.
What happened?
Ryan didn't like your cupcake?
He ate it, but he didn't
even give me a card.
Oh, who cares about him?
Plenty of other people
gave you valentines.
Like Jacob.
"Dear Juanita, my parents...
Made me write this.
You smell like Ham."
Well, you like Ham.
I like Ryan.
Why doesn't he like me?
What's wrong with me?
Nothing is wrong with you.
You are wonderful. Come here.
Oh.
Hey, sweetie, are you sure
Ryan didn't give you a card?
Yeah.
Maybe you should
double-check your backpack.
He could have slipped it in
when you weren't looking.
Why would he do that?
Boys are weird.
Take a look.
Pen, pen, pen, pen.
No.
What are you doing?
Nothing.
Hey, what's, uh, what's that?
What?
That thing that just
fell out of your backpack.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!
It's from him.
"Happy Valentine's day.
X.O.X.O. Ryan."
What's "X.O.X.O."?
Hugs and kisses.
Hugs and kisses?
Oh, he does like me.
I'm going to call him.
No, no, no, you can't do that!
Don't do that!
And why not?
Because boys don't like it
when girls tell them
they like them.
Then how will he know?
Oh, sweetie,
he knows, you know,
so neither of you
need to say it.
It's much more romantic
this way.
I'm serious.
Don't talk to him, ever.
It'll wreck the relationship.
But... if we don't talk,
what kind of relationship
is that?
The very best kind.
Oh, my God. Is this...
Chocolate? He's perfect!
Susan, this was delicious.
Ah, just a little something
I whipped up.
A toast to Julie and Susan
for inviting us
into your beautiful home,
and offering us
this amazing gift of life.
You're not drinking, Debbie?
Oh. I'm abstaining in a show
of solidarity with Julie.
I may not be able to carry
my own baby,
but I can support
the woman who is.
Oh, that's sweet.
But word of advice...
drop that plan when the doctor
starts talking episiotomy.
Oh.
Susan, I can't believe how great you're being about this.
Yeah.
It's wonderful that
your mother is so supportive.
Yeah, well, she understands
how this is going to be
so much better for everyone.
Absolutely. Can't think of
a better home for this baby
than with the two of you.
Oh.
Julie, do you mind
getting the dessert?
Oh, sure.
And, Debbie, if you're peeing
in solidarity with me,
then, uh, that's where
I'll be heading first.
Aw.
You have done
an incredible job with her.
She seems great.
Yeah. She's having
one of her good days.
Her good days?
Yeah. Seems Dr. Cohen finally
got her meds perfectly balanced.
It's why I'm letting her
use a knife tonight.
Wait. Meds?
She never mentioned anything
on her application about...
mental illness?
Yeah.
Grandma used to say
our family tree
grew nothing but bananas...
Before she hung herself.
I think legally she had
to disclose this to us.
Oh, don't talk to Julie
about legal.
Then we'll have to see
all of her jail tattoos.
Bill?
Um... what else
didn't she tell us?
I don't know.
Did she tell you
she can hold her hand
over an open flame
without crying?
Yeah, her eyes water,
but she just keeps laughing
and laughing.
But it's not all her fault.
I should've stopped drinking
when I was pregnant,
but I likes my wine.
I'm back.
Who's ready for dessert?
You don't have to do that.
Still not talking to me, huh?
I'm channeling my anger
into cleaning.
Well, I was going to apologize,
but maybe I should wait
until you tackle the bathroom.
You do realize that
scaring those people off
doesn't change anything.
I'm healthy. I'm white.
I'm a year away from my PHD.
You can't imagine how many
people want this baby.
Including me.
I'm sorry.
It's my grandchild.
And I know that you think
you have thought this all out,
but until you have held
that baby in your arms,
you have no idea
what you're giving up.
I'm going to bed.
No, please, hear me out.
You're scared. I get it.
But you can do this.
I don't wanna be
a single mother!
Why can't you respect that?
It's not so bad
being a single mother.
We had a great time.
We were like best friends.
Remember? We would have
cereal for dinner,
and we'd stay up
in my bed all night,
telling each other our secrets.
It's funny you remember it
that way,
because I don't.
I was 12, mom.
I slept in your bed
because you couldn't handle
looking at the empty side.
And how about those fun drives
past dad's apartment
to see if he was
bringing anyone home?
And the only reason
we had cereal dinner
was because that's
the only food I could make,
since you were too upset
to cook.
Uh... wow.
I...
I had no idea.
That is why I don't wanna
have this baby on my own.
Because I already raised
a child...
You.
What are you staring at?
Shh. Don't talk.
Why not?
You'll ruin our relationship.
Oh, we don't have
a relationship.
Right, that's why
you gave me the X-O's.
X-O's? What's that mean?
I'll show you.
Sexual harassment?
Are you kidding me?
She's a 9-year-old
with a crush,
not a presidential hopeful.
Regardless, here at oakridge,
we have a zero tolerance policy
for unwanted advances.
Honey, I was a model. I know
all about unwanted advances.
Try being being stuck in a limo
with a tipsy David Lee roth.
Your daughter forced this boy
to the ground and kissed him
against his will.
Oh, and we all know how much
boys hate being kissed.
He cried for 20 minutes.
He could barely tell me
what happened.
Oh, so he's a snitch
and a crybaby.
That kid's not gonna last
a day in high school.
Mrs. Solis, I don't think
you realize the gravity
of this situation.
I mean, it's not like
when we were kids.
Hey, hey, cotton top,
you and I are not the same age.
You need to talk
to your daughter,
because if she
so much as glances
in that boy's direction again,
we will have no choice
but to expel her.
Mmm.
Hey.
Hi.
I don't usually do this, but I'm
feeling rather bold tonight.
Can I buy you a drink?
Sure.
Matt, drink for my friend here.
What's your poison?
Whiskey, straight up.
I'm Bree, by the way.
Jerry.
Jerry.
Nice to meet you, Jerry.
Not much of a talker, huh?
Well, that's okay.
I will ask all the questions.
What do you do for a living,
Jerry?
I'm a roofer.
Same thing I was two nights ago
when you took me home.
Jerry.
Jerry, I'm so sorry. Ohh!
It's just so dark in here,
and I...
it's okay. It happens,
especially with this crowd.
Well, I can assure you that
I will not forget you twice.
Is there, uh, any way
I can make it up to you?
Well, I, uh...
I do remember the other night.
Mm?
And, yeah, you have
several ways.
Well, then, um...
Let's not waste any time.
Hey, kid. Want a beer?
Oh, right.
Thanks.
It's so weird to remember
being a kid here and...
Now to be...
Yeah, I'll bet.
Imagine how weird it is
for your mom.
I get that.
I just wish she'd...
Julie, if you're about to wish
that your mom would stop trying
to figure out your life for you,
you're about to waste a wish.
Sounded like you were
kinda rough on her last night.
I was.
She told you, huh?
The fact that she didn't tell me
is how I knew it was rough.
I was just really angry.
It's like she doesn't realize
this whole thing
is killing me, too.
No, believe me, she does.
That's why she won't
stay out of it.
Well, it's not making it
any easier on me.
When it comes to her kids,
your mom has one gear, Julie...
love. That's it.
And if you sort through
all the times in your life
that she drove you nuts,
what she did, what she said,
or how she acted...
You're gonna find love.
I know.
And... as far as flaws
in a mom go...
That's a pretty good one.
What's the big deal?
I kissed him.
It's a free country.
Well, some people at school
think that's inappropriate
to do on the playground.
Oh. Well, I know a spot
at the park where we can kiss.
No, no, no,
no kissing Ryan anywhere.
But that's how it works.
First, kissing,
then get married,
then he buys me presents.
Oh, my God.
You are my daughter.
Honey...
Uh, I don't think
Ryan likes you like that.
What do you mean?
He sent me a Valentine.
Actually, he didn't.
I did.
I signed his name, and I let you
think it was from him.
It's just when
you didn't get a Valentine,
you seemed so upset,
and I just wanted
to see you happy again.
I'm sorry, Juanita.
I hate seeing you
sad like this.
I'm not sad. I'm mad.
You always lie to me.
I don't lie to you.
Okay, then, where's daddy?
'Cause I know
he's not in Europe.
How do you know that?
I can tell.
I'm not a kid anymore.
I know when
you're hiding stuff.
Well...
You're growing up so fast.
Oh, honey, a part of me
still sees you
as this cute little baby
I used to bathe in the sink.
But every day you're getting
stronger and smarter.
So maybe I don't need
to protect you quite so much.
Why don't we get some cupcakes?
You and I are gonna have
a little talk.
Mom...
What are you doing?
Don't worry.
I'm putting them away.
Aw. Remember these?
No, mom, I was 1.
I had a pair that matched.
People would always look at us.
Because you were a grown woman
in pink striped overalls.
They probably thought we were
a Christian singing group.
They'd say
we looked sweet together.
I wouldn't trade that memory
for anything.
I know this is hard.
And I'm really sorry
for the way I went off on you.
No. I'm the one
who should apologize.
I had no right to lie
to those people.
And I know that I made mistakes
with you... a lot of them.
I guess I just told myself
it was okay
because you turned out
so great.
You did the best you could.
I know that.
You're a great mom.
I'd do it again in a heartbeat.
Because no matter
how hard it was...
You're always
the best thing in my life.
Mom, I've given this
a lot of thought.
And it's the toughest decision
I've ever had to make.
But I've made it.
I understand.
I'm just trying
to do what's best for her.
"Her"?
It's a girl.
Hey, you.
Sorry I'm late.
Stupid traffic.
We should get a move on if we're
gonna make our reservations.
No. No, no, we have time.
Come on in.
So can I, um,
get you anything before we go?
Coffee or a drink or...
Dessert?
Dessert?
We haven't eaten yet.
I know. I'm talking
about... dessert.
I'm not falling for this again.
Are you talking about...
sex. I'm talking about sex.
Would you like to have sex?
Now?
Mm.
You said the kids are
at your ex's all night.
We could still go to dinner.
No, no, no, no, 'cause then
it'll be hanging
over our heads all night,
and I'll be drinking too much
and laughing too hard
at your jokes,
and I really don't have
any more reasons,
so could we please
just go have sex?
Mmm.
I was kinda hoping that
we could leave that on.
Five kids. Trust me.
It's better off.
Oh, you have
nothing to worry about.
You look amazing.
Tell you what.
I turn the bedside lamp on,
and you get the candles.
How about...
I'll see your bedside lamp...
And I'll raise you..
A floor lamp?
Unh-unh. Floor lamp's out.
I'm not going over 25 watts.
Uh, how about...
Closet light on...
And I'll crack the door, and...
You...
Get to keep the candles?
Sorry. That's as high
as I can go this round.
Then I'm all in.
Oh!
Lynette?
Sweetheart?
What is going on?
I couldn't understand
your message.
That's what you left
on my machine.
Can you use your words, please?
Is this about your date
with Frank last night?
Grunt once for a "yes,"
twice for "no."
Did you have sex with him?
Sort of.
Sort of? What does that mean?
I don't wanna talk about it.
This is ridiculous.
You called me over.
Now tell me what happened.
I cried.
Oh, no. When? After?
Right in the middle.
God. Is there
any way he didn't notice?
I blew my nose in the sheets.
Kinda hard to ignore.
What made you cry?
I opened my eyes,
and... and I saw him...
this lovely man I have
a really nice time with...
and I realized...
My marriage is over.
Now didn't you realize that
when Tom took his girlfriend
to Europe?
No, I didn't,
because that was Tom,
and I kept thinking,
"boy, Tom's moving on,"
but this is me.
This is really happening to me.
Love bites, doesn't it?
What did, uh, Frank do?
He was really sweet.
Handed me a box of kleenex,
said all the right things.
But trust me,
I'm never seeing him again.
Well, think of it this way.
It cost you one guy
to face the truth.
Your marriage is over.
Now you can move on
just like Tom.
Yippee for me.
Mm-hmm.
I'm gonna tell you
the same thing I told Bree
when I took her out drinking.
The only way to live life
is wildly.
What?
You took Bree out drinking?
Yeah. Why?
Is that bad?
How the hell could Renee
take her out drinking?!
Doesn't she know
Bree's an alcoholic?
I have known Renee a long time,
and she's not exactly what
you'd call a detail person.
Well...
At least this helps explain
the way
Bree's been acting lately.
I don't know. There's not
enough booze in the world
to justify the skeezes
coming out of that house.
How could we not know this?
'Cause we're not
speaking to her,
you know,
'cause of what she did.
I was so mad. I thought
I'd stay mad a long time,
but now,
knowing that she's hurting...
It just seems mean.
Yeah.
I miss her.
I miss us being us.
So whatever happened,
we need to put it behind us
and go help Bree.
Do you think we can
get through to her?
I don't know,
but we have to try.
Uh, you sure
this is your house?
What the hell?
Wow. Booze, loose morals,
and now swearing?
Too late.
There's no Bree left.
Why are you in my house?
This is an intervention, Bree.
This isn't for tv, is it?
'Cause I'm married.
I was gonna tell you.
An intervention?
You've gotta be kidding me.
We're your friends.
We wanna help.
Get out! All of you!
Not you.
Idiot.
Talk to us, sweetie.
Why are you behaving like this?
I don't know what
you're talking about.
It's not like we can't see
what's going on.
We know you're drinking again.
And what about all these men?
We know about that, too.
Wow, can't hide anything
from you girls, huh?
And did you also know
I tried to kill myself?
What?
Oh, my God.
How'd that little nugget
of information
slip past my nearest
and dearest friends?
If this is a joke,
it's not funny.
It's not a joke.
I checked into a motel room
with nothing but a bottle
and a gun.
And you're wrong, Susan.
It is funny...
funny that the women
standing here before me...
Professing to be
my supportive friends...
Are the reason that I was in that motel room.
Bree, stop.
No! Don't give me
this "friends" nonsense.
All I ever was to you
was the organizer,
the problem solver,
a leader when you needed one,
which is exactly what I was
that horrible night
when we buried your stepfather.
And I was so grateful for that.
Liar! All of you, liars!
Because as soon
as it got rough,
as soon as there was
any trouble,
it all became my fault,
and off you went.
We had no idea.
I wish you would have told us.
Oh, I tried.
But even when I came
to you to apologize,
you slammed your doors
in my face!
Okay, fine, you're right.
We did. We screwed up.
We let this pull us apart,
but that's not gonna happen
again.
Because no matter what
you think,
we love you, Bree.
We'll do whatever it takes.
We just want things to be back
the way they were.
Well, I don't.
Frank.
What's all this?
Well, this I something
I recently discovered
called pizza.
I think you're gonna like it.
I'm sorry.
Did we have plans?
Nope. This is more
of a stealth date.
Every time we made plans,
there's been too much pressure.
So I figured,
maybe things would be better
if we sneak up on each other.
Do you have some unresolved
mother issues or something?
Well, actually, my mother
and I get along quite well.
Why do you ask?
Because that's the only reason
I can think of
of why you would
keep coming back here.
Oh, I can think of another.
I like you.
You do remember I cried
in the middle of sex, right?
Lynette, you lived
with the same guy for 20 years.
It only makes sense
that he'd be in your head.
And frankly, I'd think twice
about you if he weren't.
Is it weird to say "Frankly"
when your name is Frank?
Not until now.
Look, I'm a guy.
So obviously,
I'm a complete idiot.
But the one thing I do know
is that if you're lucky enough
to meet someone
who's sexy, smart, and funny,
and who actually likes you,
you give that person
all the time they need.
Now where's your corkscrew?
Uh, middle drawer on the right.
Hey, hey.
Mmm.
Mmm. Mmm, mmm, mnh-mnh.
Wait.
I know you're more
comfortable like this.
Leave it on.
Evening, Bree.
The usual?
I suppose it has become
"the usual," hasn't it?
Yes, please.
Hey.
You know, I got a thing
for redheads.
Wanna see it?
Charming.
It's Bree, right?
Listen, I just came here
to have a drink.
I really don't feel
like talking.
Yeah?
Well... it wasn't the chance
to have a conversation
that brought me over.
I beg your pardon?
I know what you come here for.
We can stop the game.
We can stop everything,
including this
unfortunate encounter.
Now please leave me alone.
Wait.
Wait, wait. So... so suddenly
you're some high-class lady?
Hmm? Give me a break.
Everybody in this bar
knows what you are.
You want me
to start a tab for you?
No.
No, I don't. I have to go.
I'll drive.
Please give me my keys.
Come on, Bree.
I see some of the dirtbags
you drag out of this place.
What? I don't make the cut?
No, you're vile.
Now give me my keys
and get away from me.
Whoa. This is
a new low for me.
I'm not good enough
for the town pump.
You know what?
I think we'll take my car.
Aah!
I'm not going anywhere
with you!
Get your hands off of me!
You like a fight, huh? I can play rough.
Aah!
Let go of me.
Let go!
You heard her.
Let go.
Orson!
Hello, Bree.
We'll catch up in a moment.
If you're smart,
you'll step away from her
and go back to the hole
you crawled out of.
Buddy, I got a rule about
not hitting guys in wheelchairs,
but you... you're begging
for an Asterisk.
Turn it off!
I also have pepper spray.
Orson, what are you doing here? How did you...
Your friends called me.
They said you were
going through a rough time.
Orson, I've made
such a mess of my life.
Don't worry, dear.
The one thing you and I
were always good at
was cleaning things up.
Yes, love can bring
out the best in us...
The confidence to move on...
The courage to tell the truth...
The strength to keep hoping...
But sometimes what surprises us most
isn't what love brings out...
But who it brings back.
Previously on...
Ben took money from a loan shark.
If you're not good for it,
I understand that pretty
girlfriend of yours is loaded.
Julie had more then
one surprise for Susan.
I'm giving it up for adoption.
What?
You slammed your doors in my face!
Bree rejected her friends.
Let go of me!
But it was Orson who came to her rescue.
Your friends called me.
Orson Hodge had always known one thing...
Bree Van de Kamp was
the perfect woman for him.
When he was sick,
she nursed him back to health.
When he was arrested,
she promised to wait for him.
And when he suffered a terrible injury,
she did everything he couldn't.
So now that Bree was suffering,
Orson intended to care for her.
I've found that whatever the problem,
a cup of tea always makes
things a little better.
Thank you.
To think, if you hadn't been there,
what that terrible man might've done...
Don't think about that.
You're safe now. I'm here.
You really are a good friend.
Perhaps my only one.
What a thing to say.
You're still close with Gabrielle,
Lynette, and Susan, aren't you?
Is something wrong?
We're estranged.
Really?
I thought the four of
you were inseparable.
I know, but something happened
a few months ago, and...
Bree?
After everything we've been through,
I promise you can trust me.
I don't want you to know.
You're the only one who
still believes in me.
And I always will.
Please, I can see this is tearing you up.
For your own good tell me.
About six months ago...
we threw a dinner part
but before the guests arrived at Gaby's,
something terrible happened.
Orson, I understand you're shocked,
but please talk to me.
I am shocked.
You agree help cover up Carlos' crime,
and then they just abandon you?
How can your friends do that?
You're angry at them?
Yes.
They took advantage of you
and then hung you out to dry.
It's appalling.
So even after hearing what I've done,
you still believe in me?
Yes, Orson Hodge knew that Bree
was the perfect woman for him.
And now that he had her back...
I believe in you more than ever.
He had no intention of letting her go.
Lynette Scavo had discovered
the silver lining of separation...
shared custody.
For three glorious days a week,
she had no child demanding her attention...
no one to set an example for...
and plenty of time to exercise.
But Lynette forgot that when
it comes to being a mother,
you can run...
Hey, mom!
But you can never hide.
Hey, guys. What's going on?
Nothing. Jeez, do we need
a reason to bring flowers
to the woman who gave us life?
Suitcases? Why are there suitcases?
Okay, we had a little
disagreement with our landlord,
and we were kind of evicted.
No! No! No! No! No!
Go away! You are not moving back here.
Mom, come on...
I spent 18 years getting you out of here.
There's no damn way
I'm letting you back in.
Okay, mom.
We understand.
Yeah, we have to learn to live on our own.
No.
Come on! Just for a week.
I know you guys.
A week would turn into a year,
a year into 20,
and pretty soon, you're
taking me off the respirator,
saying "It's what mom would've wanted."
Please let us in.
We're children of divorce.
Exactly. Go to your dad's.
But we like you so much more.
Don't give me that.
No, seriously, dad has
that stupid girlfriend.
And he's been so unfair to you.
You had me at "Stupid girlfriend."
Hey, sweetie. Whatcha doing?
Oh, the adoption agency sent me
a few more couples to check out.
Okay, that guy's got serial killer eyes.
Oh, he does not. That's from the flash.
Fine. You want your baby to be on the run.
Any other choices?
I like them.
Oh, gay couple.
Uh, that's not a man.
Oh, too bad. They're great with kids.
Okay, that's it. Nobody's ever
gonna be good enough for you.
So you've totally ruled out keeping it?
Yes, totally.
And I get no say in the matter?
Now you're talkin'.
You need to stop hassling her.
I just wish there was something I could do
to keep her from giving this baby away.
Hey, what if I talk to the father?
Susan...
No, does he even know
that she's doing this?
Maybe if I find him,
I tell him, and then he'll stop her.
That's a very bad idea.
Says you.
What do your friends think?
I don't know. Not allowed to tell them.
Julie wants to keep this a big secret.
So you are the only one
I'm allowed to talk to,
and I would really appreciate
it if you would agree with me.
Look, this is killing me, too.
But it's her decision.
You keep pushing her,
it's not just a grandkid
you're gonna lose.
Girls, let's go home now.
All right, I'm gonna count to three.
One...
two...
two and a half...
two and three-quarters...
You don't know any more fractions, do you?
All right, that is it, smart-ass.
I am calling your father.
And you better watch out,
because this phone has a whup-ass app.
Hi, sweetie. I am just
getting ready to meditate.
Can I call you back?
No! No, no, no. Enough
nurturing your inner child.
I need you to come home
and whack a couple of your outer ones.
I can't come home until
my treatment is complete.
That's another 16 days.
In 16 days, I can't guarantee
you're gonna have
children to come home to.
You wouldn't believe the things
that are going through my mind.
Gaby.
I'm just saying, I've got rocks,
they've got backpacks,
and there's a lake on the way to school.
Look... I know that
it has been tough on you
with me being in rehab.
You have no idea. I am losing my mind.
I'm looking after your business,
I'm running the house,
I'm trying to keep the girls in line.
Let me talk to Juanita.
Juanita, talk to your father.
Hey, daddy.
Anything biting?
Karen kicked me out.
Oh, my god. What happened?
I don't know.
Seems like everything
I do lately gets her mad.
"Lately"? She's a grouchy old lady.
That's why we love and fear her.
Nah, this is different.
I think it's gonna take
a while for her to cool down.
And in the meantime, I got no place to go.
Yeah. Well, you know,
it's fun to stay at the Y.M.C.A.
Not for me.
I slept there once.
Woke up at 2:00 in the morning
with a guy massaging my feet.
Well, at least she gave me my fishing pole
so I won't starve to death.
The church has a koi pond, right?
There's that frontier spirit.
Okay, Gaby. It's obvious
you're not picking up my hints.
No, I am. I'm just ignoring them.
Look, I'd offer you a room at my place,
but my kids are young and loud...
And I'm old and deaf. It's perfect.
Thanks, Gaby.
I'd ask Bree if I could crash with her,
but she's got Orson over there.
You need to be helping
your mother out more.
You know, helping around the house...
Thanks, honey. You've been a big help.
I gotta call the girls. Bye.
Gaby!
Ladies.
I saw you through the window
and just had to come out to say hello.
Orson.
You're back.
I am back.
Keenly observed, Susan.
She just meant it's unexpected,
seeing you after all this time.
Building a ramp.
You and Bree...
Gonna be spending more time together? Yes.
As you know, she's been going
through a rough patch of late.
The other night, she was at a bar,
and there was an incident.
An incident?
Something unpleasant with
an aggressive stranger.
She's fine.
Thank god I happened to be driving by.
Thank god is right.
But as you can imagine,
she's still a little shaken up,
so I'm gonna be spending some time here
until the dust settles.
Can we see her?
You know, I don't think
she's up for that yet.
I'm not surprised.
Yeah, last time we saw her,
it didn't go so well.
Will you at least tell her
we love her and we're here for her?
I'll be sure to relay the message.
Thanks.
Bye.
Who were you, uh, talking to?
Just the men installing my ramp.
Now how about I make us some lunch?
No, you've gotta deliver
that cement tomorrow.
Look, I don't know why Ben didn't pay you,
but I drove back to the site.
I'm gonna find your check,
and I'll get it to you tonight.
Hey!
Hey, this is private property!
What the hell?!
Damn it, Mike.
Why'd you have to come back?
Are you out of your mind?
This doesn't concern you.
You almost killed me, so I say it does.
I'm in over my head with this loan shark,
and his late fee comes with a crowbar.
Sorry... some of this equipment blows up,
the insurance company
writes me a big check,
and I'm able to keep
my knees a little longer.
That's fraud, Ben.
I know what it's called.
I just didn't know what else to do.
Well, not this.
Then what? 'cause I've been trying
to fix this for weeks, Mike,
but it just keeps getting worse.
I've lost every cent I have.
I've lost Renee.
I've... I've screwed everything up.
Are you okay?
My chest feels tight.
That's not good, is it?
No, it's not.
Let's get you to the hospital. Come on.
Thanks.
Yeah.
I see the twins are home.
Really? What gave it away?
Guys! Get your boxers off the table!
They're not mine.
Me neither. I'm wearing...
Oh, wait.
Be right down.
I swear, they're like termites.
Just when I think I've
gotten rid of 'em...
At least they come back to
you when they're in trouble.
And that's a good thing?
Yes.
Because they listen to you.
They let you help them.
They don't keep
their problems secret for six months
and then completely shut you out,
ignoring all your advice.
What's wrong?
I'm not supposed to tell you...
that Julie's pregnant,
and she's giving the baby up for adoption.
Wow. Where's the dad in all this?
"Who's the dad?" is more like it.
She won't tell me anything.
I'm sorry.
You know, right when Julie was born,
they took her away to
give her a vitamin shot,
and that was the longest hour of my life.
And now she's talking about
giving the baby away for good.
I mean, she just has no idea
how hard that's gonna be.
Do you want me to talk to her?
She might react differently
to someone who's not her mom.
No.
In fact, you can't even
tell her I told you.
Julie doesn't want anyone
knowing she's pregnant.
Oh, mornin'. How'd you sleep?
Terribly. I'd ask you, but I already know.
How can someone use the bathroom
five times in one night?
Heart of a lion,
bladder of a fruit fly.
Well, you do know they make
bathrobes with belts on them?
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to let the old komodo dragon
peek out of the cage.
Don't mention it...
ever again.
Girls, school starts in 20 minutes.
Why aren't you dressed?
'Cause then we'd be ready,
then we'd have to go, and we hate school.
Here. I made breakfast.
Ooh. Toast.
Let me know when your cookbook comes out.
Okay.
Let's talk about how
we're getting you off my couch
and back with the lady you love.
What's our plan?
Doesn't look good.
I've been calling all morning.
She doesn't even pick up the phone.
Roy, you've got to put
some effort into it.
Woo her. March over there
and sweep her off her feet.
I don't think it's gonna work.
No, no, here's what doesn't work...
me being awakened at 2:00
A.M. by that pep talk
you give your dragon when
you're trying to pee.
You want me out.
I'm sorry.
It's just, my life's really
stressful right now.
No apologies.
It was very kind of you to take me in.
I'm sure I can find another place to stay.
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.
I told you to get dressed!
I don't wanna.
Damn it, girls! Listen to your mother.
You can't talk to me like that.
You're not my dad.
Exactly. So I don't give
a crap if you live or die.
Here. You see the notches on this belt?
Thos are all the men I killed in Korea.
First time, it was a little rough,
but after that,
you develop a taste for blood.
So listen up, soldiers.
You are gonna march up those stairs,
put on your school gear,
and be back down by 8:00 sharp.
Is that clear?
All right. Now move!
Well, I guess I better go start packing.
No! No, no, no, no.
I can't send a war
veteran out on the street.
As long as America is free,
you have a place here.
Let me finish.
See, this is why I didn't tell you.
I knew you were gonna freak.
Because it's not your decision.
I don't care if you're the father.
Okay, you know what?
I'm not doing this on the phone.
Just meet me at the coffee
cup in half an hour.
Hey.
You using this chair?
Uh, no, go ahead.
Mrs. Delfino?
Oh, Porter. Shh.
I don't want to Julie to know I'm here.
Why not?
Oh, she's meeting a guy.
I need to find out who it is.
Oh, hey, Porter.
Over here.
Mom?
Oh, my god.
You're the guy.
Porter Scavo is
the father of my grandchild.
Oh!
I can't believe you spied on me.
And I can't believe you shacked up
with a kid you used to babysit.
Can I just say something?
Are you two in a relationship?
Oh, god, no. Never in a million years.
I can hear you!
We ran into each other at a bar, okay?
And I-I'd just broken up with Wwill,
and I was feeling really depressed,
and Porter bought me a few drinks.
And then we went back to my place and...
Apparently, forgot everything
I taught you about condoms.
No.
It broke.
What'd you expect? It's Porter Scavo.
He probably found it on
the floor of a movie theater.
Great.
Well, you better get used to it.
This snot-nosed kid,
the boy who got
his head stuck in our fence,
is the father of your baby.
No, the father will be an adoptive parent
who has gone through extensive interviews
and a background check.
Both of you, stop.
No more fighting. All this
stress is bad for my baby.
Your baby?
Yeah. I wanna keep it.
You do?
Yeah.
Oh, I was just doing some research online.
You might want to eat
something called folic acid,
or the baby could have a weird head.
You can't be serious.
There is no way
we are raising a baby together.
Then I'll do it myself.
Oh, please. You can't do that.
Well, uh, legally...
he can.
I mean, fathers do have rights.
Mom, what are you doing?
Nothing. I'm just reminding Porter
that he does have a say in this
and letting him know that
if he wants to raise the baby,
he'll have my support
And unlimitebabysitting.
No! No, no, no.
This is none of your business.
Stay out of it!
Porter, if you're serious about this,
I will help you.
Just tell me what you need.
Thank you.
Could you tell my mom?
Oh, hey.
I brought those contracts.
Your secretary says
to sign them so I can
bring 'em back tomorrow.
Aw. Thanks, babe.
Listen, I want you to understand
I get how much you've had
to do with me in here.
But I talked to my counselor,
and he said that I don't
have to do the full 16 days.
I can get out a few days early,
help out with the girls.
Oh, honey, you don't worry about that.
Really?
Because yesterday on the phone,
you had that whole drowning fantasy.
I know, but I got help at home.
What, a nanny?
Better. A sergeant.
I got Roy.
McCluskey kicked him out,
so I took him in.
You wouldn't believe how
he's getting the girls in line.
McCluskey kicked him out? why?
Who knows? By the way,
big oil stain in the garage?
He had the girls in there all afternoon.
It's gone!
Wow. Those two seemed so
perfect for each other.
And it's perfect for me!
Roy's a genius.
Simply by yelling at the girls
and threatening 'em with violence,
he has made our home a happy place.
But aren't you the least bit interested
in what drove them apart?
I know what's gonna drive us apart...
If you keep asking
those kinds of questions!
Hey, I, uh, I need to
talk to you about Ben.
After what he did to me, I don't care.
He's in the hospital.
He is?
What happened?
He started having chest pains.
They say it's not a heart attack,
but they want to monitor
him for a couple days.
But Ben's a young guy. He's healthy.
Why is he having chest pains?
Oh, he's been under a lot of stress.
Oh, is it the money thing?
Yeah. It's worse than you think.
He's in pretty deep to this... guy.
Guy? What kind of guy?
Let's just say he's not
exactly a licensed banker,
which is what I wanted
to talk to you about.
Ben's in trouble.
This is nice.
It's like you never left,
like all of those terrible things
I told you about never happened,
and we've been here in this kitchen,
safe.
It does feel very comfortable.
We're like a pair of old jeans.
Well, we can only assume,
since neither one of us
has ever owned a pair of old jeans.
I want to run something by you.
Of course.
Given everything
you've been through lately,
how would you feel about
a change of scenery?
How big of a change?
Maine.
My aunt recently passed.
Oh.
Ah, no need for sympathy.
She was a wretched woman.
She left her coastal cabin to me.
Well, it might be nice to
get away for a couple weeks.
Yes. And if you like it,
maybe we could make it more permanent,
you know, move there.
Are you talking about us
getting back together?
Because I'm not sure I'm ready for that.
All I'm talking about is a fresh start,
a new chapter in your life.
I don't know, Orson.
It's such a massive change.
I'd be saying good-bye to all my friends.
You mean the women who involved
you in a murder cover-up
and then abandoned you?
Well, in all fairness, they did attempt
that intervention I told you about.
Mm-hmm. And yet they haven't
come by since, have they?
Come on.
Come to the cabin.
Just for a few weeks,
to see if you like it.
You know what? Let's do it.
Wonderful.
I'll book the flight.
How's the sauce?
It's all coming together perfectly.
What was that for?
For giving me the day off.
I was able to hit the entire
left side of the mall.
And if you're willing to
keep torturing my kids,
tomorrow I'll hit the right side.
Hi, mom.
What's all this?
The girls and I tackled
that dead tree out back.
I taught them some basic
forestry procedure.
The older one is pretty good with an ax.
You might want to keep an eye on that.
Well, I can't thank you enough.
You are absolutely welcome to stay here...
for the next 16 days.
Yeah, well, I don't know if
I'm gonna make it that long.
I'm thinking about begging
Karen to take me back.
What?
I really miss her.
No, you don't.
I mean, what's there to miss?
You know, the foul moods and the nagging
and the...
Yeah, she can be a little gruff.
And god knows I got my own baggage.
But today, when I was telling the girls
we could have a cozy fire tonight,
all I could think about
was having one with Karen.
Well... I...
I... think you just need
to get your mind off her.
You know what would help?
A nice, long bath.
Yeah. Come on. Come on.
You can, uh, use my lavender bath salts.
Oh, I do like lavender.
That reminds me of a funny story.
Hilarious.
Okay, into the bath. Chop chop.
Karen! Is that for me? How thoughtful.
No, it's for Roy,
kind of a peace offering.
No. I mean, don't back down.
I've only lived with the guy for one day,
and I can tell he's a handful.
Well, the truth is, I'm the handful,
and I really need to talk to him.
I have to clear the air
about a few things.
Mm. Uh, I don't think that's gonna work.
Why not? Is he still angry?
Livid.
Yeah, he took an ax to
a tree in my backyard.
He just kept hacking at it
and muttering "Take that,
Karen!" under his breath.
Really?
Yeah,
you should go and look.
Nothing left but a stump.
Oh.
Okay.
You know what? Don't worry.
You let me work on him.
I bet you he'll come around in,
I don't know, 16 days.
Well, can you give this to him anyhow?
It's french apple. It's his favorite.
I will make sure he gets it.
Yeah.
Make this disappear.
If you insist.
Hey.
Hey.
You okay?
They say they want to run more tests,
but I'm fine.
Well, you look like crap.
Thanks. So other than boosting my spirits,
uh, what are you here for?
Mike told me you borrowed
money from a loan shark.
Mike should learn to keep his mouth shut.
Look, I don't want
you reading anything into this.
I just don't want to see you dead,
from that guy or stress.
So how much do you need?
From you? Not a cent.
Ben, don't be stupid.
You're in trouble. I can help you.
You want to help me?
Wait till I get myself out of this mess,
then let me come back to you
and apologize to you for what I did,
then allow me to propose to you again...
this time as the kind of man you deserve.
Wow.
I mean it. I'm still crazy about you.
That's terrific.
But if you don't pay those
thugs what you owe them,
they're gonna disassemble you.
And if we're getting back together,
I want the whole package,
not just parts.
Well, don't worry about me.
I can take care of myself.
Yeah.
You're doing a hell of a job.
Is there a better way
to wake up from a nap
then to the smell of
fresh-baked croissants?
The question is rhetorical,
but the answer is still no.
I've left some for you.
These are for the girls.
The girls?
Yes. I've been doing some thinking,
and it's time for reconciliation.
What a good heart you have, my dear.
But you also have a good head,
and maybe you should give
this a second thought.
No, I've given it a lot of thought,
and there's blame enough for
all four of us in what happened.
Beside if you think about it,
they actually help save me.
How?
By calling you.
You told me so yourself
that night outside the bar.
And if they hadn't, who knows
what might have happened to me?
Well, I-I suppose one could
make that argument, but...
But nothing. I am gonna thank them
for bringing you back into my life
and tell them about our trip together.
And besides,
it's time one of us made the first move.
They already did.
I'm sorry?
They came by the other day when
I was outside checking the ramp.
I didn't tell you because...
it was an unkind visit.
What are you talking about?
At first, I thought they were here
to apologize for how they treated you.
But then the comments started...
how you "Deserve" what happened
and how they regret calling me
because now I was "Stuck" with you.
They said those things?
And more.
Worse.
I swore I wasn't gonna tell you, Bree,
but I couldn't let you humiliate yourself
by extending kindness to
people so undeserving of it.
No, I'm glad you didn't hide it from me.
You're always trying to
protect me, aren't you?
Lynette, oh, I'm so glad
you could come over.
Oh, you said you wanted to talk.
What's going on?
Come sit down.
Put your feet up.
Have a cookie.
Okay.
Look at us,
beings friends...
eating cookies.
Can you imagine us being even
closer than we are right now?
Um... I think we're pretty close already.
I'm just saying,
wouldn't it be great if we were family?
Okay, Susan, if you need
a ride to the airport...
No, not that.
I just want to share some amazing news...
about our children.
No!
No! No! No! He can't be having a baby!
Here! Honey, breathe into this!
Okay. It's gonna be okay.
Julie's gonna give
the baby up for adoption.
I don't know why people do this.
Uh, actually, in a very mature move,
Porter says he wants to keep the baby.
What?
Yeah. He wants to raise it himself.
He can't raise a baby!
He can't even take care of himself.
All he eats are frozen waffles...
still frozen!
Okay, you just need to calm down.
No, what I need is...
is a time machine to go back there
so I can slap some sense into that idiot.
In fact, I'm gonna do
the slapping part right now.
No, no, no, no. You...
you can't be mad at Porter.
I mean, you should've heard the way
he was talking about the baby.
He's so excited.
Yeah, and he'll stay
excited for about a week,
just like he did with the puppy
we gave him in fifth grade.
Know what happened to that puppy?
No.
No one does. And...
and what was Julie thinking?
Julie?
Yeah, she should have some sense.
She's getting a PhD.
My kid eats waffsicles.
You're missing the point here.
Your son...
Yeah.
And my daughter... they made this
sweet little baby together,
and we could help raise it.
Oh. I... I already have
a sweet little baby,
who is only months away from day care.
I am not going right
back to the beginning.
I see.
You're afraid of being inconvenienced,
so you want to give
the baby away to strangers.
No.
I want to give that baby away
to people who are ready to be parents.
It's better for Porter,
it's better for Julie,
And it's sure as hell
better for that baby.
Hey!
Look at what I'm doing.
Pay attention to me. Tell me I'm great.
What is happening?
I'm thirsty. I want a glass of water now!
Water! Water! Water!
Oh. You're a baby. I get it.
No, Porter, you don't get it.
When this baby comes,
it's gonna want food and clothes
and a home to live in,
because babies are selfish that way.
I think I can handle it.
Are you serious?
You've never been able
to commit to anything.
Maybe if Julie was giving
birth to a video game
or a new porn site,
but there is no way in hell
you are ready for this!
Can I talk now?
Yes, go ahead, but if I happen
to roll my eyes and snort,
just know I was provoked.
Everything you said is true.
I-I'm not ready for this.
I have $17 in my checking account
and no clue how to write a resume.
Yeah, a couple days ago,
that didn't bother me,
but now it's all I can think about.
Well, you're gonna have
to do more than think.
I will. I'll get a job.
I'll take... I'll take classes.
I'll do whatever it takes.
Okay.
Okay, that's great, but...
when you are a parent,
there is so much you are
gonna have to give up.
Your whole life just...
It is gonna change forever.
It already has.
She's not even born yet,
and I can't believe
how much I'm dying to... see her.
Mom...
I love her.
I really, really love her.
I hope you're happy,
Porter hired a lawyer.
He wants to raise the baby.
Hey, is that such a terrible thing?
I mean, he's not gonna be doing
it on his own. I'll help.
You think that makes it better?
Now when I come home,
I'll have to see her.
Do you have any idea how
painful that's gonna be?
I just...
want to forget this ever happened.
Julie, it's your daughter.
You're never gonna forget.
You don't know that.
Yes, I do,
because I've had a daughter.
You can't possibly understand
this until you have one, too,
but every single day
that you're not with me,
I think about you.
I wonder what you're doing,
I worry if you're safe,
and I hope you are happy.
No!
This was my decision to make,
and you took it away.
I can't forgive you for that.
Oh, there you are.
I can't get Celia to take a bath.
Do you still have that dummy grenade?
You okay?
I just didn't think
it was gonna end like this.
After all these years,
I thought I'd finally found the one.
Oh, it's just a rough patch.
You two will come out of
this stronger than ever.
I don't know about that.
At my age, falling in love
is not about all that drama
you young people go through.
It's about finding
the one who'll be there,
holding your hands, at the end.
I thought...
Karen would be that person for me.
But I-I guess I was wrong.
So we got your M.R.I. back,
and I'm afraid the results
are not what we'd hoped for.
The cancer is back.
It's metastasized to the brain.
So the drugs have stopped working, huh?
I'm afraid so.
But we'll start you
on an aggressive course
of radiation right away,
and there are new therapies we can try.
Thanks for giving it to me straight.
Karen...
We've been through this before,
and you are a fighter,
but this is gonna be tough.
You're gonna need a lot
of support from Roy.
Actually, uh, Roy's out of the picture.
He and I split.
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
I'm not.
He had to watch his first
wife get sick and die.
He doesn't need
to go through that again.
Trust me.
This is for the best.
If you don't mind,
I'd like to just pay the entire bill today
and close out this account.
And, uh, I assume
you'll honor our agreement
to keep this just between you and me.
Yeah, sure.
You have a lovely home.
I can tell you like the finer things.
You were married to that yankee, right?
I heard he cheated on you.
Man, you must have cleaned
up in that divorce.
It always amazes me how much power
is in this little piece of paper.
I mean, with it,
all your problems disappear.
Without it,
your aussie friend...
he ends up begging one of my guys
not to shoot him in the kneecap.
Uh, you... have your money.
Are we done?
Sure, we're done.
Normally, I'd never take a check
but you seem like a classy lady,
and I know where you live.
I remember this.
I bought it for you in Milan.
Cashmere.
It's one of my favorites.
Much too fussy for where we're going.
You want to stick with more comfortable,
casual things, Bree.
Is everything okay?
Yes. It's just that I don't think
I've ever seen you this confident.
Well, I'm not the same
man I was two years ago.
I've let go of a lot,
changed my life completely.
How did you do that?
Well, it started when
I learned to drive again.
Really?
Mm.
I know it sounds strange,
but for me, in my condition,
that freedom changed everything.
Driving was a way
for me to move forward with my life,
to let go of the past.
Being on the road gave
me a new perspective.
I started to see the silver lining
in even the worst situations.
I learned to be calmer,
more patient.
I even began spending more time in nature.
And I started reaching out to old friends.
It took time,
but little by little, I became a new man.
What an inspiring story.
Perhaps when we're in Maine,
you can help me start
the process of changing my life.
Oh, Bree, don't you see?
The process has already started for you.
I suppose it has.
Trust me, darling.
You won't believe where
it's going to end up.

Previously on...
Susan discovered that Porter
was the father of Julie's baby.
No, the father will be an adoptive parent
who has gone through extensive interviews
and a background check.
Both of you, stop.
I wanna keep it.
Then Lynette found out...
No, no, no! He can't be having a baby!
Gaby took in a houseguest...
Karen kicked me out.
And Karen got bad news.
The cancer's back.
Ben's money problems took a toll...
Let's get you to the hospital.
And Renee stepped in.
Normally, I'd never take a check,
but I know where you live.
Orson returned...
How would you feel about
a change of scenery... Maine?
With a plan.
You won't believe where
it's going to end up.
When it came to raising her children,
Lynette Scavo was used to
doing things without help.
Her husband would often
travel on business...
or rush out to important meetings...
or sneak out for a game of golf.
But just because Lynette
was used to doing everything herself...
You done yet?
Didn't mean she liked it.
Yes, I'm done.
Thank you for your help.
Okay, uh, I wanna thank you
both for joining me.
I know you're worried about
my decision to be a single father.
No, not worried.
More like panicked and terrified.
Well, I'm here to let
you know that as of today,
I've got everything under control.
I got a job.
Just working in a restaurant,
but it's decent pay,
and there's health insurance
for me and the baby.
Well, that is great news.
L-Lynette, don't you want to
tell our son that's great news?
I'm waiting for the "But."
There doesn't have to be a "But."
It's Porter. There's always a "But."
But... they don't exactly
provide child care.
At a restaurant? That's so weird.
They usually have a whole play area
between the knife block
and the deep fryer.
So I'll need a little help with the baby.
How much help?
I don't know. Eight hours...
A day... every day until...
She turns 18?
No.
She could be super smart and
end up going to college at 15.
Aw, sweetie, she's not
gonna be super smart.
Lynette.
Porter, I'm sorry.
I am not gonna keep telling you
what a bad idea raising this baby is.
You're a grownup and
you've made your own decision,
and I'm even starting to
make my peace with it.
But?
But I can't raise her for you.
We-we-we can barely take care of this one.
Yeah.
Wait. Wait. Where-where did she go?
I thought you were watching her.
Well, it's your house.
I'm sorry. You're gonna have
to make other arrangements.
I found her!
Wow. I don't know what I was thinking,
expecting you to care about my baby.
I mean, you're only the grandmother.
I am happy to be her grandmother.
I will fill her room with stuffed animals.
I will feed her
ice cream behind your back.
I will spoil her like nobody's business.
But when it comes to
the heavy lifting, I am done.
Or will be very shortly.
Okay. I see where you're coming from.
I guess I'll have to find some stranger
to watch over little baby Lynette.
Lynette?
You were gonna name
your daughter after me?
That's incredibly touching.
It changes nothing.
Yes, Lynette Scavo had raised
her children without much help...
Here you go. Practice.
And she was determined
that Porter do the same.
Orson Hodge had a plan.
He was determined to reclaim
the heart of a woman...
whose loss he had never gotten over.
He loved her so deeply that
he was willing to be patient...
and obsess over every detail
until at last, the moment arrived
when she was just within reach.
Okay, open.
What is this?
It's a little book of inspiration
I put together for you.
I wanted to show you some
pictures of my cottage in Maine.
It's right on the coast. Look.
See? There's the lighthouse.
Oh! These photographs are breathtaking.
It's even more beautiful in person,
when you hear the foghorn and you...
you breathe in the sea air.
Oh, I feel it already. Hmm.
Oh, Orson, I can't tell you
how happy this makes me.
This is exactly what I need right now.
Absolutely. You deserve a break
after all that ghastly business
you've been through lately.
Yeah, the murder, the investigation,
all those chilling letters you received.
Letters?
Yes, the letter
you received after the murder
and the one after Chuck Vance was killed.
I never told you about the second letter.
That's right. I heard
about it from Lynette.
You talked to Lynette about the letters?
Yes. The other day,
when she came over with the girls.
Personally, I thought it
was very indiscreet of her,
but, well...
Yet another example of how
those women can't be trusted.
Oh, let me show you this one.
It's my favorite.
That patch of dirt is your favorite?
Fresh-tilled soil in a raised bed,
overlooking the ocean.
The perfect place for
you to plant a garden.
Oh, Orson, I can't remember
when I've been this excited.
You have truly thought of
everything, haven't you?
Let's hope so, darling.
And our Doppler radar will be tracking
those scattered showers
as they move from eastern Pennsylvania
right into the western Pennsylvania area.
Now when we come...
I could hear that at the store!
Oh, no. One of
your girls having a birthday?
I can only imagine them on cake.
No. This is for Carlos.
He's coming home Thursday.
You got a bottle of champagne
for a guy getting out of rehab?
What, they were all out of opium?
No, this is for me.
This whole rehab thing
has been very stressful.
So this is his big homecoming,
watching you get loaded?
And a balloon.
That guy puts up with a lot from you.
What's that supposed to mean?
Why don't you think of
someone other that yourself
just once in your life?
You're right. It's horrible here.
So why don't you just
walk out the front door?
Believe me, I would
if I had anyplace else to go.
Well, as the balloon tells us,
Carlos is coming home soon.
So what's your plan?
I thought we'd watch the basketball game,
maybe do a little grilling.
Carlos always liked my tri-tip.
Well, you know who else
likes your tri-tip? Karen.
Yeah, she does.
I'm talking about steak, Roy!
Isn't it time you two patched things up?
Send her some flowers. Make nice.
I tried all that.
If she wants me back,
she knows where to find me.
Now after the break,
we'll answer all your burning questions
about barometric pressure,
so make sure you stick around.
How'd it go with Julie?
Made it to the train with time to spare.
I think she was eager
to get back to school.
I was sort of hoping she'd change her mind
and come back with you.
"Guess what, mom? I decided to stay."
Well, give her some time. You never know.
I think I know.
Porter? Is everything okay?
No. Everything pretty much sucks.
I thought I had a job,
but my mom says it's not good enough.
So I wrote up a resume.
Well, this looks great.
I mean, any boss would
be lucky to have you.
I mean, you're young, energetic.
You had a paper route
and you're "proficient in martial arts",
though not proficient in spelling it.
What was the job that
your mom said wasn't good enough?
Waiting tables at the Carlyle.
I mean, I know it sounds kinda lame,
but it's a stepping-stone.
I'd take classes,
learn about the business...
try to work my way into management.
Or even own my own restaurant,
just like my parents used to.
Wow, Porter, that sounds
like an actual plan,
and a good one.
Yeah. There's just one problem.
It doesn't have day care.
You should take that job.
What will I do with the baby?
Well, lucky for you,
you happen to be looking
at Fairview's finest day care provider.
Porter, me. I'm the day care.
When the baby is born,
you just drop her off
with me whenever you need.
I will spoil the heck out of her.
You don't mind being stuck
with a baby all day?
It's a baby. Who could be stuck?
My mother, for one.
Well, for me, it's a dream come true.
Honestly, you would be doing me a favor.
Thank you, Mrs. Delfino.
Oh, you know what? You're gonna
be raising my daughter's child.
I think it's about time
you started calling me "Susan".
Or better yet, "grandma".
No. Susan.
Son of a bitch!
What are you doing?
I... just noticed you had
some flowers delivered,
and I was snooping to
see who they were from.
You wanna know who?
No.
They're from Roy! He wants you back!
I just saw you cutting
those roses from Bree's garden.
No, you didn't. You're old.
You can't see anything.
You've got clippers in your pocket.
You have clippers in your pocket!
Your finger's bleeding.
Your finger's bl...
All right, can I just come in?
Come on.
Look, Roy may be too proud
to send flowers himself,
but he misses you.
Whatever.
Why are you being like this?
Just get over your silly
fight and take him back.
He's crazy about you.
Really? Then how come
you're over here and not him?
'Cause I'm kinda to blame for this?
I fed the flames of your little spat
because, let's face it, I'm selfish.
My girls were out of control,
and Roy's a genius at scaring
the crap out of kids.
But now Carlos is coming back,
so I'm all about you two
being lovebirds again.
Save your breath, Gaby.
It's not gonna happen.
What's going on with you two?
You know, none of your damn business!
Now take your stolen flowers
and your clippers and...
Karen, what's the matter?
Nothing.
I'm on new medication.
Sometimes I get a little light-headed.
You don't look so good.
I'm-I'm gonna go and lie...
Lie down.
Karen!
Karen! Oh, my god! Oh, my god!
Okay.
Hi. I need an ambulance right away.
4358 Wisteria Lane.
Hey, guys.
Whatcha doing?
I'm helping Mrs. Delfino
paint the nursery.
Nursery?
It's a room where babies live.
Yes, thank you.
Why would Susan need a nursery?
You didn't tell her?
I volunteered to look after the baby
so Porter could start
that new restaurant job.
Yeah. He said you didn't want
to be stuck taking care of her
all the time,
and I'm thrilled to do it.
That's... really nice of you.
And of course it goes without
saying that you are welcome
to come over and play anytime
with my granddaughter.
Our granddaughter.
Uh, sorry.
Oh, mom. I-I wanted to ask,
can we take the old bassinet?
My bassinet? The one all
five of you kids slept in?
Yeah. That's why I thought it was cool.
Now my kid gets to sleep in it.
Doesn't it make you want to cry?
Yeah. Yeah, it does.
Renee.
What are you doing here?
Learning ten new ways to cook kale.
And letting you know
your financial troubles are over.
What do you mean?
I met with your loan shark...
a sentence I never thought I'd be saying...
and I settled your account.
All you have to worry about
now is getting better.
I told you I didn't want you to do that.
I think the words
you're looking for are "Thank you."
I'm serious. I didn't want
you to get involved in this.
Look, if you and I are
gonna keep hanging out,
there's something
you need to know about me.
I do what I want.
Thank you.
But I want to be perfectly clear.
I-I will be paying you that money back.
Oh, I know.
And it's probably gonna take a while.
Good thing I'm not going anywhere.
It could be years.
Shh. Just lie there and look pretty.
Uh, come in!
And don't be an ax murderer!
Hey, kids, dad's home!
What's going on, Tom?
Kinda busy right now.
Actually, that is why I am here.
Parker, Penny, you guys around?
Hey, guys.
Hey, dad.
Go pack your bags.
I've tried that, Tom. They come back.
I figured I'd take 'em off
your hands for the rest of spring break.
Oh, we're going to your place?
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Cool!
And you already got plenty
of stuff there already,
so pack light!
This is actually happening?
You're taking the kids for an entire week?
Well, um, after our talk with Porter,
I got to thinking that you never
really get any time to yourself.
And when I was out of town,
you had the kids for weeks.
So... I owe ya.
If we weren't separated,
the things I'd do to you...
Anyway, uh, thank you.
It'll be much easier getting
things done around here
when it's just me and the baby.
No, no, no. I'm taking Paige, too.
Well, who's gonna watch
her while you're at work?
Jane.
She hasn't taken care
of a baby in forever.
She's-she's really looking forward to it.
Okay, that's really generous.
And here comes the herd.
Later, mom.
Wait, wait. Give me a hug.
Bye.
All right. Love you.
Have a good time. I love you.
Have a good time. Mwah!
I love you, mom.
I love you, too.
So what are you gonna do with
all this time to yourself?
Oh, that is a problem
I look forward to solving.
Bye, Paige. Thank you!
I spoke with your doctor, and I know.
What?
Doctors aren't allowed to talk
about patients' conditions.
Well, they can if you're family, mom.
Why didn't you tell
anyone the cancer's back?
Because this time, I ain't gonna beat it.
Oh, you don't know that.
Yeah, I do.
So this why you've been pushing Roy away.
Look at my smart daughter,
piecing it together.
He doesn't know about any of it?
No, and he's not going to.
But this is a scary thing.
Maybe you should let him help you.
Why, so he can be miserable, too?
Karen!
Roy went through this
when his first wife died.
I'm not putting him through it again.
Gaby, I'm begging you.
Don't do this to him.
Just don't tell him.
Oh! You know what we need here?
Over the crib, a mobile with
twinkly little butterflies.
Those were Julie's favorite.
Twinkly butterflies.
And, you know, we could
put her name on the wall
in big, bright letters.
Do you have a name yet?
I was actually thinking about "Lynette."
For a baby?
Let me think about that.
Oh! You know what else we could do?
A mural. Like, winnie the pooh,
and his head is stuck in the honey pot.
I brought you guys some coffee,
but it sounds like one
of you doesn't need it.
Oh, I'm not caffeinated.
I'm just high on baby.
Is there any sugar?
Uh, in the kitchen.
That baby is gonna feel
right at home here.
Oh, well, that's why I'm doing this.
Uh-huh. Are you gonna keep Julie's bed?
Well, she was here first.
And besides, I mean,
if she... if she does come back,
she'll need a place to stay.
Right. So when Julie comes to visit,
she'll be sleeping 4 feet away from
the baby she doesn't want.
Think I should move Julie's bed?
I think you should do
whatever makes you happy.
Hon, did you find the sugar?
That's what I was looking for.
Lets just hope the baby takes after Julie.
This is the kind of
thing that chaps my ass.
If Marmaduke ate my pillow,
I'd shoot him right in the head.
Hey, Roy?
No, Gaby.
I wouldn't actually shoot a dog.
It was a joke.
I just realized the other day,
I don't think I've ever heard
you talk about your first wife.
Miriam?
I didn't even know her name.
Miriam.
How long were you guys married?
39 years.
She died 2 weeks before
our 40th anniversary.
Oh, my god. Cancer, right?
Brain.
Son of a bitch, that kind.
A real son of a bitch.
That must have been the worst thing
you ever went through.
You'd think.
Wait, are you saying it wasn't?
Sounds weird.
It-it's hard to understand.
I wanna understand.
Okay.
When you love somebody,
love them a long time,
you get lazy.
You figure they know it,
so you stop saying it so much,
stop showing it.
Yeah.
But when you know you're gonna lose 'em,
that they won't be there
to hear you say it...
Oh, boy, you make damn sure they know it
every second of every day.
I'm so sorry I brought it up.
Nah. These?
I earned 'em. I was there for Miriam.
I told her everything
I needed to tell her,
held her hand when she was scared.
Nah, these don't bother me at all.
Oh, Roy. I made a promise to someone,
but I'm gonna have to break it.
Renee. It's so good to see you again.
A loan shark and a Jehovah witness?
Not a combo you see often.
What?
I'm kind of embarrassed to admit this,
but I'm a terrible bookkeeper.
The cheque you owe me to pay
off your boyfriend's loan,
I had the amount wrong.
Oh, so you're here to give me a refund?
Not exactly.
I really like this house.
Tell me, what does fire insurance cost
for a place like this?
Okay, why don't
you pick up your violin case
and drive your big Cadillac back
to the "Godfather"
movie you crawled out of?
You are not gonna intimidate me.
You sure about that?
It's how I make my living,
and business is good.
Ah, I get it.
You see the sweet suburban
neighborhood and think,
"I can push those people around."
Well, let me tell you something.
I do not come from a place like this.
You got all you're gonna get. We're done.
I'm the one that decides when we're done.
See ya around.
Is that everything?
I think so.
Have you taken one last look down the lane,
fixed an image in your mind?
Why? We'll only be gone for a month.
Will we? Something tells
me that once you taste
one of those delicious
Maine lobster rolls,
you'll never want to come back.
Aren't we getting ahead of ourselves?
Promise me you'll keep an open mind.
Fine. Mind open.
This is gonna sound silly,
but you know what I'm most excited about?
What?
We finally get to wear those hats I bought
for that alaskan cruise
we never got to take.
Jiminy Christmas. I left mine at home.
Orson!
We'll buy another one.
But it won't be the same thing.
I had them monogrammed,
and I always imagined us wearing them
on some wonderful adventure together.
Oh, that's all right.
We'll just stop and get
it from your apartment.
My apartment?
We don't have time for it.
Don't be silly. It's on the way.
And besides, most people
don't get to the airport
four hours before their flight.
No! No, we can't.
Do you know how long it takes
to go through security in a wheelchair?
Certainly not four hours.
Bree, please.
Orson, is something wrong?
No. No.
You're trembling.
It's-it's-it's nothing.
It's just, you know me and punctuality.
Well, this is hardly the way to start
that relaxing vacation
you've been promising me.
You're right. I'm sorry, dear.
Apology accepted.
Now let's make that
the last time we quibble on this trip.
Now we're off to your apartment.
Lynette, Porter's not here.
No, I know.
I just felt bad you were doing
all the work on the nursery,
so I freed up some time
in my schedule to help.
You know, painting, moving furniture,
whatever you need.
Uh, actually, we already finished.
Oh. Can I see it?
Of course. Uh, sure. Follow me.
I know pink is a little traditional,
but then I found
this black and white bedding
for the bassinet I just love.
Makes it feel like
a little French girl's room,
don't you think?
Who's Sophie?
Oh! Uh, that's what Porter
decided to name the baby.
Uh-huh.
Porter decided to name
the baby after your mother?
He did ask me for some suggestions.
Interesting. He told me
he was naming her Lynette.
I know, but...
baby Lynette?
What's wrong with that?
Oh, nothing. It's just, "Lynette" is so...
You
Really?
Well yeah!
And you have set the bar
so high on that name.
Do you want to burden a tiny little baby
with trying to live up to that?
And nobody thought I'd be interested
in hearing about this name change?
Oh, my gosh.
Are you upset about this?
Oh. I thought you were into
being the hands-off grandma.
Well, I'm trying to get my son
to stand on his own two feet,
and I guess I didn't count on
you being the pushy grandma.
I guess your definition of "Pushy"
is being helpful and
wanting to get involved.
Oh, I wanna be involved.
It's my granddaughter, too.
Well, I don't see you setting
up a nursery in your house.
Oh, well, maybe I will.
There's just one thing I need.
Lynette, give that back!
No.
Porter wants it here.
He says it pulls the whole room together.
Oh, yeah, 'cause Porter has
such a keen eye for design.
What is going on? What's wrong?
What's wrong?
You're calling Lynette "Sophie,"
you're making my son a waiter,
and you're trying to turn my granddaughter
into a French girl. That's what's wrong!
Okay, that doesn't make any sense,
and it's incredibly petty.
Well, not as petty as trying
to steal somebody's grandchild!
My first visit to your apartment.
I must admit, I'm a bit ashamed
I never came by before.
Yes, well, truth be told,
I'm a bit ashamed of how modest it is.
So if it's all the same,
I'd prefer it if you wait out here.
I'll just be a minute.
Absolutely not.
I'm sure it's perfectly charming.
Actually, it's also a mess.
There, I said it.
Oh, what you must think of me.
Orson, I know you.
A "Mess" means you haven't
fluffed the sofa pillows today.
Now come on. Let's get you that hat.
Oh, hell's bells.
What?
I seem to have forgotten my key.
Oh, dear.
Sometimes I think I'd forget my head
if it weren't attached to my body.
Of course, then I wouldn't
need to get my hat.
The manager has a master key.
Would you mind running down
to the office to get it?
Of course not. I'll be back in a sec.
Orson? I've looked everywhere
and I can't find the manager.
Don't worry.
I'm such a muddle head.
I forgot that I keep
a spare key in the pouch.
It's one of the good things
about being in a wheelchair.
It's like having a mobile purse.
After you.
What a lovely place.
And, of course, your pillows
are perfectly plumped.
It served its purpose.
And now...
on to new adventures.
You look very dashing.
Thank you.
Uh, let's not dillydally.
We-we still have a plane to catch.
Oh, we... and we must stop by
a newsstand in the terminal.
The novel I'm reading is simply dreadful.
Oh, and I know how much
you despise airplane food.
Perhaps we can pick up
a little bite for you as well.
Bree?
It was you?
You did it?
You wrote the letters?
Oh, my god.
You killed Chuck.
Yes.
For you.
What?
He was going to arrest you.
I had to do something to stop him.
Everything I did, Bree,
was to protect you.
Protect me?
How was writing the letters
supposed to protect me?
They tormented me,
almost drove me to suicide.
Well, I'm sorry it went that far.
But I knew I had no
chance of winning you back
unless I could isolate you from
those awful friends of yours.
So I wrote the letters
knowing those women
would turn against you,
and they did.
But why would you want
to turn them against me?
Because as long as they were in your life,
I knew I would always be a distant second,
and that wasn't going to
be good enough for me!
Not this time!
I had to have you all to myself.
That's how much I love you.
You're insane.
Bree.
Bree, we both know what
it means to commit a crime
for the greater good.
Do not compare yourself to me!
I was protecting people I love.
You were only pursuing
your own selfish desires.
No, I did it for both of us!
You took advantage of me
at the darkest moment of my life.
You're a sick, pathetic man,
and I know that someday
you will pay for your sins.
Bree, don't go! You're everything to me!
Well, you are nothing to me.
And I never wanna see you again.
You mind if I come in?
Sure, but I've already been screamed at
by one Scavo today,
so can we keep it civil?
If this is about Susan,
you can save your breath.
Oh, come on, Lynette.
I know how much you guys
care about each other.
Hey, you wanna have sex with me?
That'd really piss her off.
Uh, I'm going to pass on that, but thanks.
Okay.
I don't understand why she's so mad at me.
She said she wanted nothing
to do with Porter's baby.
Can I tell you a little secret?
That was her first reaction
to all five of our kids.
Oh, I don't believe that.
I mean, she is a great mom.
None of this makes any sense.
Now we're gettin' somewhere.
I just never thought
my life would end up like this.
It's like I'm turning into white trash.
Lynette, I come from white trash.
You are nowhere near that.
Really?
I'm separated,
my kid is having a baby out of wedlock,
I'm getting into public fights...
I'm two weeks away
from having a washing
machine on the porch.
Meanwhile, Susan's getting
everything she wants.
Yeah, I don't think Susan's life
is going the way she'd hoped, either.
All I know is, she's the one over there
painting a nursery for our grandchild.
Yeah...
with your son,
not her daughter.
That's the thing about Lynette.
She always complains that
she has to do everything herself.
But god help you if you try
to do anything for her.
I have a bruised tailbone to prove it.
I made the same mistake as you.
And I was married to her. I should know.
What did you do?
I took the kids off her hands for a week.
And she was fine at first.
Then she started calling every ten minutes
to remind me to give Paige her medicine
or to make sure that
Parker wore his retainer.
She needs to be needed.
Exactly.
And given what I've been going through,
I kinda get that.
Yeah.
So if you could, Susan, cut her a break.
She's lost a lot.
I don't want her losing you, too.
I think that's why
she's going so overboard
on this nursery thing.
She hopes it'll get Julie
excited about the baby,
maybe bring her back.
You know, you're taking all my anger away,
and that's not gonna leave me anything.
Yeah, it will.
It'll leave you your friend.
Many holes in the metro area.
Ladies and gentlemen...
What you won't do to get
out of being married to me.
Aw, crap.
I knew I couldn't trust the jumping bean
to keep her mouth shut.
These are for you.
Rushing things a bit, don't ya think?
Not dead yet.
No, but I'm about to kill ya.
What the hell were you thinking?
I didn't want to put
you through this again.
Karen, I married you for better or worse.
We had the better, and now...
Well, what if I say I don't want you here?
You're an old lady.
What are you gonna do about it?
I'm scared.
I know.
Hey, Renee.
Hey, uh, just wanted to let you know
that Ben's test results just got back,
and, uh, everything is normal.
He's getting out tomorrow.
That great news.
Oh, and I got more.
We're back together,
and I have you to thank for that.
Well, you don't have to give me credit.
Uh, yeah, I do,
because if he breaks my heart again,
I'm giving you the blame.
Hey, did you say you're at the hospital?
Yeah.
Is anybody staying at your place?
No. Why?
I just thought I saw a light turn on.
It's probably nothing,
but I'll go check it out.
What the hell are you doin'?
Some people use voice mail.
I preffer to deliver
my messages in person
So...
Why don't you just move along
before you get involved?
Too late.
I keep forgetting you're
the tough guy around here.
Well...
I don't want any trouble.
I don't ever wanna see you again.
Then you should have killed me.
Hang on.
Wait, wait, wait.
Surprise! Welcome home!
Whoa! Who did this?
I did.
Really?
'Cause when I got home from prison,
all you left me was
a post-it note on the fridge,
and it said, "Take out the trash, ex-con."
Well, I don't want to take
you for granted anymore.
You sound like you actually mean that.
What's going on?
Keren's cancer is back,
and it's bad.
That's why she threw Roy out.
Oh, god.
Kind of makes you think.
I mean, when we got married,
I thought that was the finish line.
But it's not. Death is.
No one told us that.
Yeah, they did.
At our wedding, they said,
"Till death do us part."
Oh, Carlos, please.
I had four glasses of
champagne before the ceremony.
I almost married your uncle.
Oh, come on, Gaby.
I mean, the idea that we might die someday
must have at least crossed your mind.
I just never thought about
what it really means,
that one of us is gonna die,
and the other one's gonna live through it.
And if it's you who's first?
I don't think I can do it.
Yes, you can.
You're one of the bravest people I know.
Look at what we've been through this year.
You've been my rock.
I have?
Well...
you and scotch.
But from now on, just you.
Thank you.
And, hey, if it makes you feel any better,
you can always take
the easy way out... die first.
What's going on with the name?
You didn't change it to "Sop," did you?
'cause that's even worse than "Lynette."
"Lynette" isn't so bad.
Thanks for that.
You can count it on.
Thank you for all the rest of this.
So you need anything?
The nail holes need to be spackled.
Mm. I'm on it.
Hello? Bree, it's Orson.
Listen to me.
Don't you ever call my house again.
I can assure you this is
the last you'll hear from me.
What do you want, Orson?
I've been thinking about what you said,
and you're right.
The sins that have been
committed are so reprehensible
that a sacrifice must be made.
The ultimate sacrifice.
Do not consider suicide.
That would only be adding
more sins to your list.
You don't have to judge, Bree.
Someone else will do that for you.
Good-bye... forever.
Yes.
There are times when we all
could use a little help.
When our generosity has
been repaid with cruelty...
when our behavior has
filled us with regret...
and when our future has
become terribly uncertain.
But then there are those who
are past the point of help,
and in their wake,
they leave nothing but destruction.
Previously on...
Tom and Lynette drifted further apart,
and Jane took advantage.
I'm scared.
Roy helped Karen face her cancer.
We're done.
I'm the one that decides when we're done.
The loan shark threatened Renee.
But Mike stepped in.
I don't ever wanna see you again.
Then you shoulda killed me.
Bree discovered the truth about Orson...
You wrote the letters? You killed Chuck?
And cut off all contact with him.
Don't you ever call my house again.
I can assure you this is
the last you'll hear from me.
But Orson had the last word.
In our neighborhood,
there are people we see every day,
and every day, we take them for granted.
As we go about our lives,
we may be busy with a mundane task
and miss one another completely.
Or we might give a polite wave,
only to return to what we were doing.
One minute, we're spending
time with a loved one...
and the next,
we're wrapped up in our work.
Or preoccupied with our own problems.
What a shame these neighbors
take each other for granted...
because in just a few days...
one of these people will be dead.
That afternoon, old friends got together
to share coffee and
gossip and to discover...
Is there a cup for me?
That they were still
old friends after all.
So Orson was behind everything...
Chuck, the letters?
Do you know why he did it?
He thought the only way
he could have me to himself
was by tearing me away
from you three.
Well, guess what? He failed.
That's right, because
we are still here for you.
And no psycho-on-wheels
is gonna change that.
And I'll tell you something else.
He better not show his face
around here ever again.
What's wrong?
The last time I spoke to Orson,
he... intimated that
he would take his own life.
Oh, sweetie.
And I should have done something.
I should have made him
tell me where he was
and gone to him.
Why? So he could torture you some more?
I know what he's become, but you all know
there was a time when
I loved that man very much.
Well, he's not that man anymore.
Okay, have we been sad long enough?
Because I'd just like
to point something out.
We are finally in the clear.
She's right. The letters were
the last question mark left.
So maybe now we can get back to normal.
Yes. Our nightmare is finally over.
Thanks.
Is everything all right over here?
Doctors... they should learn
how to talk to people.
I'm afraid I don't understand.
We just got back from my appointment.
Looks like the cancer's spreading
faster than anyone thought.
Oh, Karen.
Yep. He gave me
the ol' "Put your affairs
in order" speech.
Only not that nice.
These are people these
doctors are talking to,
not just some name on a chart.
They can all go to hell!
I'm so sorry.
He's just pissed at the world.
Oh, I've got it. I've got it.
How about you?
I can't even imagine what
you're going through.
I'm really gonna miss
the Christmas festival.
The lane looks so pretty when
the lights are, you know...
Karen...
if there's anything I can do for you...
I mean it. Anything.
Yeah. Thanks, Bree.
Come in!
Wow! The place looks great.
You are going all out.
Ever since Porter's big announcement,
I have a new policy for all our kids.
If you can resist procreating,
I will throw you a bitchin' party.
Well, I just...
I wanted to drop off
Penny's present, so...
Champagne? Isn't that taking
the bitchin' party idea
a little too far?
That is for you.
You went through 22
hours of labor with her.
Seems like you should
get to celebrate, too.
That is so thoughtful.
Uncharacteristically thoughtful,
and now that I think about it,
you could have brought
Penny's present to the party,
So, um...
what's going on?
Okay, um... I was just wondering...
if you wouldn't mind...
maybe we should open that champagne now.
Just say it.
I-I want to bring Jane to Penny's party.
Oh, god.
Look, I know it's a little awkward.
Bringing a date to
your daughter's birthday party
when you're still married?
Yeah, it's a little awkward.
This is a family event.
I know, but Jane is part of my life now.
Yeah. Your life.
I'm sorry, Lynette, but...
I really want to start including
Jane in some of these things.
Why?
Well...
Dad!
Hey, you.
Is that for me?
Ahem.
Can I open it?
Hey, I know this trick,
and if I let you open it today,
you are gonna guilt me
into buying you another one
on your actual birthday.
That's totally what I'm going to do.
And I am totally gonna fall for it.
What... hey!
Hey, hey, hey.
Didn't you wanna finish our conversation?
Another time. Just enjoy the champagne.
You had to get the girls a cat,
didn't you?
Even though you know I'm allergic.
Oh, you say you're allergic
to everything you don't like...
Cats, raisins, the vacuum cleaner.
Hey, that is medically verified.
Girls, show mommy how sad we'd be
if she made us give back Rufus?
Oh, how could I say "No" to such sad
and obviously rehearsed faces?
Daddy, you wanna see him do a trick?
Kitty, fetch.
Now come back.
Rufus?
He kinda does whatever he wants.
Well, he should fit right in around here.
I'm not the one who just brought
kitty litter into our lives.
Look... if the cat makes them happy,
then it makes me happy.
One thing I realized in rehab...
there is nothing more important to me
than taking care of you guys.
I love you for that. Mmm.
Ah! Before I forget,
I got you a present.
A tie.
It's for your first day
back at work after rehab.
Something that says,
"I'm sober, I'm stylish,"
"and my wife has excellent taste."
I was having so much fun
with you and the girls,
I... kinda forgot I have to work tomorrow.
Well, you could say "Thank you."
I spent a lot of your money on it.
Sorry, babe. Thank you.
Okay. Bedtime for bonzos!
Hello there.
Thank you for fixing my car today.
I like a man who's good with his hands.
It's very sexy.
Although I think my engine is
still running a little hot.
Vroom.
Susan, what are you doing?
The question is,
"Who am I doing?" the answer is "You."
Oh. I'm sorry. I'm just really beat.
All that hard work really
took it out on you, huh?
Well, hey...
maybe this is something
that will relax you.
Hello.
That a gun in your pocket,
or are you just happy to see me?
Oh, my god. It is a gun.
You've got a gun in your pocket?
Susan, don't freak out.
Why do you have a gun?
Sit down.
I have something I need to tell you.
Did you mean what you said today?
Karen.
About helping me with anything I need?
'cause a lot of people say that,
but they don't mean it.
No. No, I meant it.
You sure? Because let's be honest.
You and I never really liked each other.
We haven't?
No.
Well, I definitely meant what I said.
Whatever you need, consider it done.
Good. I want you to help kill me.
Um... maybe we should
talk about this inside.
Karen, you can't seriously
be considering this.
Listen, cancer's a bully,
and when it's as bad as mine,
it laughs at our pathetic
little attempts to fight it.
So here's how I win...
by making sure that I'm the one
that says when and how I go.
So... will you help me?
What does Roy think?
Well, Roy was the first one I went to.
He couldn't do it.
Too much of a marshmallow.
I need someone cold and heartless.
And that's me?
A dying woman's sitting in front of you,
and you haven't even
offered a cup of coffee.
What does that tell ya?
I don't... I don't know
if I could do that.
I don't want to die alone, Bree.
And the chemo's just kicking my ass.
I don't want to waste
away in some hospital bed.
Please help me go the way I want to.
All right.
I'll help you.
Sorry to keep you waiting,
Mr. and Mrs. Delfino.
What can I do for you?
My husband did something really stupid,
and now we need police protection.
Susan, please, just let me handle this.
And by "Handle this," he means,
"Stare out the window
with a gun in his pants."
Could you... start from
the beginning, please?
A buddy of mine...
and I'm not telling you who...
borrowed some money from a loan shark,
and things got a little out of hand,
and I had to help him out.
Oh, and by "Help him out," he means
"Beat up a mob guy,
putting our whole family in danger."
Does your friend know it's illegal
to use the services of a loan shark?
He does.
Do you know it's illegal
to assault someone?
The guy was breaking into
our neighbor's house.
I tried to get him to leave,
he threw a punch,
and I defended myself.
And now this lowlife
wants to kill my husband,
so you need to arrest him.
Well, if you had called us
after he broke into your neighbor's house,
maybe we could have.
Oh. So it would have been
smarter to call the cops
instead of slapping Jimmy Knuckles
around the living room. Huh.
Where have I heard that before?
Oh, that's right... from me.
What's this about a gun?
Do you have a permit for a gun, sir?
All right, detective,
I think we're wasting your time.
I can take care of this.
No, Mike. You've been taking care of it,
and look where it got us.
We have a 9-year-old son.
Okay. Okay, look, here's what I can do.
We have your address.
I'll make sure the patrol
car keeps an eye on things.
and if you see this guy, call us.
Wait. That's it?
Ma'am, I'm afraid that's all we can do
until something else happens.
Great. Well, maybe we'll get lucky,
and something else will happen.
Honey, there's fresh coffee.
You want me to put some in a travel mug?
Okay.
What's wrong?
30 days with the rehab hippies,
and you've already
forgotten how to tie a tie?
I've just been thinking.
I've worn a tie every day for 25 years,
and I've always hated
the way it feels around my neck.
So? I wear lots of uncomfortable things...
High-heeled shoes,
bras that mash my boobs together.
I'm starting to think that a tie
is basically just a fancy noose.
Oh, honey.
You're not nervous about
your first day back, are you?
I don't know.
I just thought I'd be
more excited than I am.
Well, you're the boss.
You want excitement, shake things up.
Buy a new xerox machine
or get some post-its in crazy colors.
Take the staff to happy hoho.
Get stinking drunk.
Okay, maybe not the stinking drunk part,
but you know what I mean.
I gotta get the girls to school.
See you tonight.
I'm just saying, you didn't
have to fight that woman
over a pair of boots.
I saw 'em first.
On her feet.
Sorry. I shop New York style.
Until someone is either
bruised or bleeding,
no sale is final.
Hello?
Oh, hi, Karen.
No. No, now is not a good time.
Uh, Renee's visiting.
Well, uh, I'm open tomorrow.
Perhaps I could euthanize
you in the morning.
Great. I will see you then.
So I couldn't help but overhear.
It's Karen. Her cancer's spreading.
Oh, no.
Yeah.
She's... depressed and...
wants me to help her die with dignity.
Oh, my god. Are you gonna do it?
Of course not.
She just got devastating news.
She's in a state of shock.
I'm just trying to string her along
and buy some time until
she's thinking clearly again.
Think that'll work?
It's got to.
By the way, to help her
keep her mind off it,
I'm having people stop by and have tea,
You know, play scrabble with her,
maybe give her a foot massage.
Do you think tomorrow maybe
you could stop by and...
Bree, if I touch that woman's feet,
you're gonna have to euthanize me.
Billy, where are you?
Oh, look, look! There's a gold!
Come on! The gold!
Aah! Hi!
Mom?
Yeah?
This party is amazing. Thank you so much!
Oh, I just wanted
your birthday to be perfect.
Happy birthday, Penny.
Then again, nothing's perfect.
Hey, Jane. Tom went to pick up the cake,
so if you wanna wait in the car or...
Oh! I didn't know you
were bringing a guest.
Actually, this is my gift for Penny.
A geisha?
My niece Cindy. She's a photographer.
Hi. Nice to meet you.
She's gonna take pictures of the party,
and then I'm gonna make a memory book.
Cool!
I knew you would love it.
Come here.
Funny faces.
Perfect.
Can I talk to you for a second?
Okay.
What are you doing?
Just making sure I'm in the memory book.
You're invading every photo
that Penny and I are in.
I'm her mother. Maybe you're the invader.
And we're back to this.
I spent weeks planning this party,
making it perfect for her,
and then you come in
and upstage me?
I'm just trying to forge
a relationship with Penny.
Well, stop forging. You're not family.
You're just some woman her father is...
"seeing."
Well...
"Well," what?
Well...
that's not all I am.
What does that mean?
You know, you should probably talk to Tom.
Tom's not here, so why don't you tell me
what the hell you're talking about?
Okay.
I really didn't want you
to hear this from me,
but since you're insisting...
Tom asked me to move in with him.
So now you know.
Sorry!
The cake took longer than I thought.
What?
This is how I find out
you and Jane are going to
live together? From her?
Oh, no, no, no, no.
She wasn't supposed to say anything.
Well, she didn't get the memo
because she did say something
in my house... the house you and I lived in.
I didn't deserve that.
I am so sorry, Lynette.
I really need to put this cake down.
Why didn't you tell me?
I tried the other day,
but Penny wanted to open her present,
and I didn't want to ruin her birthday.
God, Tom.
You've only known her three months.
We were talking about the future,
and living together is the next step.
Oh, you're talking about steps now?
Jeez, I wonder what
the step after that could be.
We haven't talked about that.
That's good,
since you and I aren't even divorced yet.
I know.
I thought maybe we should
talk to a lawyer or something
this week.
Really?
I thought this was a trial separation,
to see how we did apart,
to see if we could be happy.
That's the thing.
I am happy.
And if you're not, I'm really sorry.
Can I get a picture of mom and dad?
Karen, what in the world are you doing?!
I lost a contact.
Oh, my god. You were hoping
I would run you over.
Well, what choice do I have?
You said you'd help me,
and then you keep blowing me off.
Now are you gonna kill me today or what?
No, I cannot kill you today.
I have pilates.
You know, Bree, it sounds
like we're just playing games.
Karen, I really wanna do this.
I mean, I don't want to,
but... let's go for tomorrow.
No excuses.
Really?
Really.
'Cause I'm serious about doing this...
with or without you.
Hello?
Mrs. Solis?
It's Marilyn, your husband's secretary.
Hi, Marilyn. Why are we whispering?
I don't want Mr. Solis
to know I'm calling you.
Why? What's wrong?
Uh...
He's been acting a little strange,
and I just really need
you to come down here.
He's coming.
Excuse me.
Marilyn, what's going on?
What's going on?
He's giving away all our money!
Who's this guy?
Patrick McDonald, our C.F.O.
Do you see all these people?
A while back, we took
over a steel company,
chopped it up, sold it,
made a nice profit.
These are some of
the workers who got laid off.
Okay, so what are they doing here?
Carlos has taken it upon
himself to make things right
by writing each of them
a check for $50,000.
Uh... okay.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Oh, boy. He keeps this up,
and we'll be bankrupt
in a couple of weeks.
Uh, Mrs. Solis,
I'm a party girl with a taste
for young brazilian gentlemen.
I really need this job.
I'm on it.
Honey?
Hey, babe, took your advice.
My advice?
You told me to shake things up,
so I decided to make work
a place I want to be.
Hope this helps.
And remember, you can be
anything you wanna be.
Nothing is out of reach.
What do you say, Skip?
Thanks, mister.
Honey, this is how you shake things up?
By giving away all the company money?
Oh, actually, I was afraid that
Patrick would put a stop payment
so I decided to start using
our personal account.
All right, run along, tiny tim.
Okay, let's go.
Sweetheart...
you can be honest with me.
Have you been drinking again?
Nope. Haven't had a drink in 34 days.
Then why the hell are you
acting like a crazy person?!
You think this is crazy?
No.
What's crazy is making a fortune
off of other people's misery
without thinking for one minute
how they're suffering.
What's crazy is thinking
you can find happiness
in a paycheck or behind
the wheel of a sports car.
What's crazy is thinking that
you're doing something
important with your life
just because you're wearing a tie.
What?
I'm trying to find Ben.
He's not at his house.
Is he here?
No.
What do you need Ben for?
I want him to tell me where
that loan shark lives
so I can go to his house.
To do what?
I don't know. May-maybe
I'll give him some money.
Maybe I'll kill him.
I haven't decided yet.
Okay, sweetie, you're a little worked up.
Sit down. I'll pour you a glass of wine.
No, I have to fix this. I'm terrified.
I haven't slept in days.
And my husband is walking
around our house with a gun.
Ooh, sorry.
Why are you apologizing?
Mike's the one who started this mess.
You mean when he stuck
his neck out for Ben
and protected me? Is that
the mess you're talking about?
Look, when you've been burned
by men as often as I have,
you stop believing in that fairy tale idea
of the guy on the white horse
who comes in to save you.
But... meeting Mike and
seeing how he is as a husband
and a father and a friend,
well... he got me believing again.
Susan...
he is a good man.
You really think that?
Or are you just trying to calm me down?
I really think that.
And I really wanna calm you down.
So if I pour this glass of wine,
will you not go and kill anyone?
Okay.
Okay.
Bree! How you doing? Karen's taking a nap.
Actually, it's you I wanna talk to.
May I come in?
Sure.
Mmm! That pie smells wonderful.
Yeah. Karen made rhubarb.
I don't know why.
She knows I don't like it.
How could you not like it?
It's the one pie
she makes better than I do.
Well, may I cut you a slice?
Sure.
So...
What's going on?
We have a real problem on our hands.
I can't believe she asked you to do this.
She doesn't even like you.
Yes, we've established that already.
I figured when I said no,
that would be the end of it.
No, she seems more determined than ever.
What the hell are you doing?!
What?
That's my suicide pie.
Your what? I made it to kill myself.
It's full of sleeping
pills and tranquilizers,
and a bottle of liquid something.
Oh, my god. I ate two pieces!
Oh, I'm so sorry, Bree.
So you wanna go to
the hospital or somethin'?
Yes, I wanna go to the hospital!
What were you doing making suicide pies?
Well, if you two would grow
a pair and help me out...
Oh, sure, I'm the problem
because I didn't wanna murder my wife.
Can we please continue this in the car?
In case you've forgotten,
we need to get to the emergency room now!
What are you doing?
You're going the wrong way.
She can't make a 3-point turn.
I can make a 3-point turn.
This is just easier.
Okay, can we just please stay focused
on getting to the hospital?
And F.Y.I.... your turn signal is on.
Yeah, I'm gonna make
a left up on Oakhurst.
You're not gonna take the interstate?
Wouldn't that be faster?
She can't merge.
I can merge. The interstate
is always jammed.
Plus I gotta stop and get gas.
Okay, that's it. Stop! Stop the car!
Ugh!
Get out! I'm driving.
There's no need to get so nasty.
I have every right to get nasty.
You poisoned me!
Making that pie was a stupid thing to do.
You have no idea what I'm going through.
Oh, yes, I do.
Three months ago, I was this
close to killing myself.
It was a quick fix on
a very depressing night.
But in the morning, I realized
it was the most selfish thing I could do.
It's not the same.
You weren't dying. I am.
I know.
But if you take your life,
it'll ruin the memory
of everything you were before that.
It's all anyone will remember.
Look at Roy.
Is that what you wanna do
to the man who loves you?
Baby, I don't want you
to go before your time.
Okay.
I'll stick around for as long as I can.
Ohh, that's lovely,
but we still need to get
to the emergency room.
Oh, for heaven's sake.
It's open!
Ah.
What are you gonna share with me today?
The results from my colonoscopy?
My mom died?
I shouldn't have said what I did.
It was wrong, and I'm truly sorry.
Are those the cheese puffs I brought?
Yeah. I guess nobody liked 'em.
Well, more for me.
23 years I've been married
to that man. 23 years.
And then we hit a rough patch,
and we stumbled,
and then he finds you...
I totally get it.
I'm talking!
He finds you,
and it kind of makes him
stop trying to find me again.
And then when someone has to tell me
that you're moving in together,
and we both know what that means,
you do it.
I said I'm sorry.
And it almost sounded sincere.
Fine. Have it your way.
I only came because Tom
asked me to apologize.
I don't care what you think of me.
Of course you don't.
You only care about you.
I think you're sneaky, Jane.
I think everything you do,
you do on purpose.
I think you couldn't wait
to see the look on my face
when you told me you and Tom
were moving in together.
I think you actually liked it.
I think you enjoyed it. I-I think...
What the hell?
I couldn't breathe!
I-I'm sorry. I panicked, and I mean,
n-not all of us are doctors.
I think I'll go.
Hey, Murphy.
Yeah?
You better take a look at this.
Some crazy stuff in there, huh?
Yeah.
Any chance this could be on the level?
Bree van De Kamp.
I know her. She's the one who
ripped Chuck's heart out.
I got a feeling about this.
Enough of a feeling to go
dig up a construction site?
Yeah.
Are you sure you looked under your bed?
I looked everywhere. Rufus is lost.
Okay. Honey, mommy can't
help you right now.
Go look in the backyard.
So just you, or did
you adopt a bunch of orphans
on your way home?
Come on, Carlos. Talk to me.
What was that about today?
Do you remember Bill,
that guy from rehab I was
always talking about?
Oh, yeah, Bill.
He was my counselor?
Oh. Yeah. Bill.
He told me this story about his dad.
He was a pilot in Vietnam,
and he'd be flying his plane,
3,000 feet up, drop his bombs,
go back to base.
It wasn't until someone
sent him a "Life" magazine
that he saw the results of his...
missions.
It ruined him.
What, he didn't know?
He was dropping bombs.
Things were going "Boom."
It was the distance.
And that's what I've been
doing all these years...
dropping bombs from that skyscraper,
and I can't keep doing it.
I can't keep destroying lives for some...
bottom line.
Rufus! Here, kitty, kitty!
So what are you saying,
you're gonna quit your job?
Yes.
Oh, my god.
But not until I find a new one.
And what will that be?
Well, I was thinking...
maybe counseling.
In one week, Bill does more good
than I've done in my entire life.
Yeah, and in one week, you make more money
than Bill will make in his entire life.
I'm not saying that
we wouldn't have to cut back.
You know, we may have to
do a little downsizing.
Whoa! Whoa! Like what?
I need specifics, Gandhi.
I don't know!
It just seems like
we have a bunch of stuff
That we don't need...
big-screen TVs, two cars,
a really big house.
Well, you want us to move?
Yeah! Maybe to someplace
with a good public school.
Uh, not you're yanking
the kids out of private school,
which they love, that's your solution?
Help! Help!
Juanita?
Juanita?
Mommy!
Oh, my god!
Okay. Baby, don't move!
I'm scared!
It's okay, sweetie!
Daddy's coming. Just hold on.
Aah!
And don't look down.
Okay, baby,
you think you can walk
slowly over to daddy?
No. I-I can't move.
Okay, then I'm coming out to get you.
No, wait, Carlos! Be careful!
We are gonna take this...
nice and slow.
Okay, just keep your eyes on me.
Oh, my god!
It's okay, it's okay.
I got you. I got you.
Juanita's finally asleep.
She okay?
Yeah, thanks to you.
God, that was so scary.
You know, if anything
had happened to her...
It really puts things into
perspective, doesn't it?
Sure does.
Reminds you nothing's more important
than taking care of family.
I could not agree more.
Good.
So does this mean you're giving up
all that crazy talk and
going back to work?
No!
The exact opposite.
It means I'm more aware than
ever of what really matters...
giving back.
Why do you keep calling it that?
You're not giving. You're taking...
from us, your family.
I don't know why I thought
you'd understand this.
You have always been selfish.
Guilty! I am selfish.
But you knew that when we got married.
That was the deal...
You make the money, I spend it.
And I'm still holding up my end.
Gaby, I am miserable at work.
I can't do it anymore.
Do you know how many times
I thought to myself,
"I can't do it anymore"?
When you were drowning
your guilt in booze,
when you disappeared in rehab,
But I willed myself to
hold this family together
because someone had to!
And guess what?!
Now it is your turn.
I've got something to tell you.
Oh. You're still mad, aren't you?
No.
You're a hard guy to stay mad at,
Mike Delfino.
And I think I figured out why.
I figured out what it was about you
that flipped my switch
the very first time I met you.
Gotta be the rugged good looks.
No. But they didn't hurt.
Okay. So what was it?
You don't get scared.
Me?
Nah, that's not true.
No, it is. You don't get scared.
It's what everyone thinks
when they meet you.
Because you always take care of people.
Why are you like that?
Hmm.
Uh, my, um...
my dad beat the crap out of my mom
when I was little.
Bad.
I'd hear it happening.
And there wasn't anything
a 10-year-old kid could do about it.
So...
maybe this came from that, and, uh...
but... my whole life...
when I see somebody in trouble,
I can't walk away.
But I can tell you
something I am scared of.
I get scared that maybe somehow...
because I'm not the most
expressive guy in the world...
maybe I never made it clear
to you how much I love you.
No.
No, I got that.
I should start dinner.
I thought you said you were
gonna fix that fence post.
Tomorrow.
Ohh, tomorrow.
Hey.
One more thing.
Delfino!
We all take the gift of life for granted.
If only we could slow things down.
I'm Mike Delfino.
I just started renting
the Simms' house next door.
Susan Mayer. I live across the street.
Whatcha doin'?
Locked myself out, naked.
So how are you?
I've never seen you look so beautiful.
He said I'm pregnant.
Mike?
Because before you know it...
the gift is gone.
Mike. Mike? Oh, god.
Mike! No.
No. Mike. No.
No!
Mike!
No!

He is a good man.
But he paid the price.
Every day on Wisteria Lane,

that's below par.
These everyday problems

I don't know how you can

When a loved one dies,
certain decisions
have to be made.
A coffin must be selected.
A headstone must be picked.
Clothes must be chosen.
Preparing a body for burial
is never an easy thing to do...
But unearthing one
can be even harder.
Hey! I think we got something.
What do you think?
You look handsome.
What's that under your shirt?
My little tribute to Mike.
He would've loved that.
He was always trying to get me
to go to Indianapolis
for a game.
And I was too busy
being a big executive,
helping rich people get richer.
That'll be a...
Great eulogy someday, huh?
Is this about you wanting
to quit your job again
so you can be
an underpaid counselor?
I'm never gonna be able to get
you to understand this, am I?
What a difference
it would make in my life
if I felt like
I was helping people.
You're right. I'm never gonna
understand it, and I also
don't understand why we have
to talk about this today.
Because my best friend is dead,
and he died trying
to help people,
so if you ask me,
it kind of seems like
the perfect day
to talk about it.
This one?
Sure.
Um, shoes?
You pick.
Hi, Reverend.
Hello, Julie.
Susan.
I, um, wanted to show you
a... rough draft
of Mike's funeral service.
It's what we discussed...
a standard
episcopalian ceremony.
I'm sure it'll be fine.
Um, just wanted to see
if you'd like to add anything
to make it
a little more personal.
Readings, for example.
Did he have any favorite poems?
Any favorite writers?
Mike really wasn't
much of a reader.
That's fine.
Were you planning on saying
something during the service?
Like what, "I wish someone
hadn't murdered my husband"?
Mom...
He's just trying to help.
I know. I'm sorry.
I just, uh...
I don't know what I would say
that would be enough.
I don't know how to tell people
what kind of man Mike was...
what kind of father and husband
and friend he was.
I just...
never thought I would
have to sum up his life
before he was...
done living it.
It's going to be okay.
Please, Reverend,
if there's one thing that I know
for sure at this moment,
is that...
bothing is ever
going to be okay again.
Hey.
Hey.
How's Susan holding up?
She'll be really glad you came.
I caught the first flight
after you called me.
I'm just, uh...
I'm still in shock.
You know what I keep
thinking about all morning?
Do you remember that time
you, me, Mike, and Susan
rented those cabins
by the lake?
Oh, no. The pontoon boat?
Yeah, the pontoon boat
with the broken gas gauge.
And I kept telling everybody,
"Don't worry.
They'll come looking for us."
And then the sun started to go down.
Who knew Mike was
such a great swimmer?
I know. It was half a mile to
shore, at least, in cold water.
He was an amazing guy.
I just can't believe
I'm never gonna see him
walk out of that house again.
I'm sorry.
I've been doing a really good job
keeping it together until now.
I'm so sorry, Lynette.
He really seemed like
a good guy.
Yeah. He was a great guy.
Well, we should
probably get going.
Hey.
You want to ride with us
to the church?
No. I still have to get ready.
So you guys go ahead.
Hey, Bree.
Oh. Please tell me you're not
wearing that to the funeral.
Uh, actually that's why
I was coming over.
I'm not going to the funeral,
so could you please tell Susan
how sorry I am?
You have to be there.
The whole neighborhood is going.
Uh, yeah, and they'll
all be thinking,
"There's the woman
that Mike was protecting
"when he beat up
that loan shark.
She's the reason he's dead."
Renee...
Mike stuck his neck out for me,
and now Susan's a widow,
and a 9-year-old kid has to
grow up without a father.
Look, I know you feel awful
about what happened,
but today is about
honoring Mike.
You do not get to make this
about your guilt.
Why are you looking at me
like that?
Because you're right,
and it's annoying.
Come on.
Go get changed,
and I will save you a seat.
Ugh. I really hate today.
Me, too.
Mrs. Van de Kamp?
Can I help you?
I'm detective Heredia,
Fairview P.D.
Oh. Uh, if this is about
Mike Delfino's murder,
I'd be happy to help, but...
as you can see,
I'm on my way to his funeral.
Actually, we already made
an arrest in that case.
Thank God.
I'm here
on an unrelated matter.
It's a missing persons
investigation.
Oh?
Yeah, I'd like you to come down
and answer some questions.
Now?
Please.
As she arrived
at Mike Delfino's funeral,
Gaby considered what her friend
Susan must be going through.
After all, Mike was
the love of Susan's life,
and that got Gaby thinking
about the love of hers.
So...
what do you think?
A lot of things.
Most of them obscene.
I like it, too!
It's royal wedding with
just a hint of slut.
So... how much?
Who cares?
You get what you pay for,
and you are getting this.
$12,000? Dios mio.
We didn't even pay this much
for our first house.
Yeah, well, how much
can mud and straw cost?
Ladies.
We are having a nice time.
Let's try and keep it that way.
Now be honest, mama.
Don't you like the dress?
Does it only come in white?
I'm just saying,
she's not fooling anybody.
Well, I think
she looks beautiful.
We'll take it.
No.
I will not let you spend money
like that.
Uh, could you give us a moment?
Ugh.
What are you doing?
She loves the dress,
and you keep insulting it.
You just don't get it,
do you, Carlos?
This is only the beginning.
You give in to her with this
dress, she'll bleed you dry.
Trust me.
That woman is a gold digger.
Hit her, Carlos.
Hit her.
Mama,
you know I love you,
but if you say one more
critical thing about Gaby,
don't bother
coming to our wedding.
Understood?
Well, I guess
you've made your choice.
I just hope she realizes
how lucky she is.
Mm. No.
I am the lucky one.
I've never met anyone like her,
and when she smiles at me,
you can't put a price on it.
So I don't care
if I have to work
20 hours a day
to keep her happy.
I'll do it.
Carlos, sweetie,
you know what would really make
this dress pop is...
Oh.
No, I shouldn't.
Tell me. What?
Well, it's probably too much,
but a pair of diamond earrings?
Then our next stop is
a jewelry store.
Mm.
Hey. What are those stains
on the living room rug?
The green is Juanita's puke,
the yellow is Celia's puke,
and the red is my Merlot.
Since when are you drinking wine
in the middle of the afternoon?
Since the girls started puking
in the middle of the afternoon.
Your soup is coming, Juanita!
Yes, Celia, yours, too!
Here. My shift is over.
No. No. No. No. No.
I can't, Gaby. Not tonight.
Why not?
I've been with them
since they got
the stupid stomach flu.
I haven't slept in four days.
I need a break, Carlos.
Tomorrow morning, ten clients
from Japan are flying in,
and in order for me
to win their giant account,
I have to wow them with
a PowerPoint presentation that
I have not even started yet.
All I hear is "blahbety-blah.
Japan. Blahbety blah."
I need a massage.
Oh, my God. Not again.
Every time a bell rings,
an angel does not get its wings.
A child almost gets hit!
It's just endless.
If something isn't coming out
of their mouths,
it's coming out of their butts.
Every opening is
on full service.
I can't do this anymore.
I'm starting to lose my mind!
Okay.
Okay.
Go get your massage. I will
take care of them tonight.
What about Japan?
This is more important.
I told you I would
always take care of you.
Go. Go get your massage.
Hey, girls! Daddy's home!
I got your soup!
Surprise taco visit.
Don't get too
excited. That's not a euphemism.
Hey, babe, I'm kind of
in the middle of something.
What are you in the middle of?
Obviously not shaving
or putting on deodorant.
You look like a terrorist.
Can you please
just come back later?
Okay. I mean,
I thought it'd be nice to have
lunch together, but fine.
I'll just leave these for you.
Mike?
Hey, Gaby.
So Mike gets to come visit,
but not me?
Mike is just being a friend.
He gets what I'm going through.
Ah, I did my own little stint
in rehab.
I know how hard this can be.
Right. What do I know?
I'm only his wife.
Gaby. Gaby, wait.
He's a little on edge right now.
Cut him some slack.
You think I came here
to give him a hard time?
I just want to be here for him.
Yeah, but you being here
just reminds him
how he's messing everything up.
He feels like he's failing you.
Oh, that's ridiculous.
Why do you think he's pushing
you away?
He can't stand
you seeing him like this,
and frankly, I think
he's a little scared.
Of what?
He's always provided for you,
and if you think
he can't do that anymore,
he's afraid
you might leave him.
Mike was a good man...
and so are you.
You should quit your job.
What? But you said that...
I was wrong.
If being a counselor's
gonna make you happy,
then that's what you should do.
As Lynette looked
at a wedding photo
of Susan and Mike,
she thought about the tragic
end of their marriage,
and that started her thinking
about the beginning of her own.
Oh, I got this.
No. No. No. No. No.
I got it.
Why? 'Cause you're the guy?
No, because I asked you out.
It's only fair.
Let me get it.
No. Next time.
Next time?
You're asking me out
on a second date?
Abso-tively.
Okay, but you should know
I have a 3-date rule
before I even consider
sleeping with someone.
For the record, I wasn't,
uh, expecting anything.
That said, if you take me out
for coffee now,
I would be willing to consider
that a second date.
And what if after that,
I offered you
half the candy bar
I have in my glove compartment?
Would that count
as a third date?
Let's have the coffee first
and see how it goes, shall we?
Let's get out of here.
So do we need
to tell H.R. about this?
Why would we?
Well, I think they want to know
when employees get
in a relationship.
Tom, we don't have to do
the whole relationship thing.
I am not one of those girls
looking for a ring and kids
and a house in the suburbs.
Although I am kind of partial
to white picket fences.
You don't think
there's anybody out there
who can
make you change your mind?
Not for the next seven years.
I have this whole plan
where I become Vice President.
Of the United States?
I meant the company,
but we'll see.
Okay. Can I look now?
My back is aching,
my ankles are swollen, and your
hands smell like cheese.
Ta-da!
What is this?
It's your dream house.
Someone already bought it.
Yeah, I did, for you.
Ow!
What the hell's wrong with you?
You don't just buy
someone a house.
The exception to the rule
being dream houses.
No, you still
should've consulted me.
This is a decision we're
supposed to make together
and...
Ow!
Oh, cramp. Oh, my foot.
Here. Sit down.
Okay.
Sit down.
Here.
Where is it? Right there?
Right there. Right there.
Come on.
Admit it.
This is kind of nice.
Yeah, it's nice,
but...
I have certain things
I want in a home.
I know. Like a-a tree house
for the twins to play in.
There's the perfect tree
for it.
And an herb garden...
there's a great spot
on the other side of the house.
And of course,
your white picket fence, just
like you always dreamed about.
Wait. I never said anything
about a white picket fence.
Sure, you did.
On our first date.
You said you were a sucker
for a white picket fence.
There's no way I said that
on our first date.
You did. I remember,
because as soon as you said it,
I got this image of us
sitting on our porch,
watching our kids play
while we drink lemonade
and look out over
our white picket fence.
Yeah, this does
seem like a nice place.
I'm sorry
I did this without you,
but I knew,
when I saw this house,
that you would love it.
Because I know you
better than anyone.
Mm.
Mm.
Mm.
Ow!
Here. These are yours, too.
Ah.
Thanks. Um, do you mind if I
take the portable CD player?
The one I use
while I'm cooking?
How else
am I gonna play my CDs?
Yeah. Sure. Take it.
Okay. Thanks.
How you doing?
Great. It's all the fun
of a garage sale
without making any money
and only getting rid
of stuff you really like.
Why aren't you fighting harder?
It's just a CD player.
I'm talking
about your marriage.
Lynette, you know me.
I hate talking about this stuff,
but everybody on the street
knows you and tom are
supposed to be together.
I don't know.
At this point,
there's so many bad feelings,
I think time apart
will help us.
It won't.
I've been through this.
All right, I know how it goes.
Each of you waiting
for the other one
to admit they were wrong,
beg to be taken back.
The problem is,
the whole time you're waiting,
you're just growing
further apart.
But you and Susan
got back together.
And I kick myself every day
for letting it take so long.
What I'm trying to say is,
somebody's gotta make
the first move.
I can't right now.
I'm too angry.
And one day you won't be.
I hope it's not too late.
For either one of you.
Don't let it bother you, honey.
What?
Tom, showing up
with his girlfriend.
It's fine.
I actually don't think it's
gonna last that much longer.
Yeah? You heard something?
No, I decided something.
Bree Van de Kamp
found herself helpless
in the face of a powerful man.
And this got her thinking
about the ways she'd handled
powerful men before
and how she'd learned to do it.
Bree.
What are you making?
Honey pecan pie.
It's your father's favorite.
Can I help?
Pie's done,
but I can teach you
how to make whipped cream.
Of course
there's so many things
I should probably
teach you first.
Like what?
Like... how to be a woman.
That is the most important
lesson I can pass down.
As the cream thickens, you whip
it a little faster, okay?
Don't I become a woman
just by getting older?
Oh, no, Bree.
There's some things
you're too young to understand,
but...
I think you're old enough
to learn about the mask.
The mask?
It's what my mother called it.
It's the face you wear
when you don't want people
to know what you're feeling.
All well-brought-up women
conceal their emotions.
It's very useful, especially
when dealing with men.
Why?
Well, if a man
knows what you're thinking,
it gives him power over you.
For example,
if a man knows
how much you love him,
he'll take you for granted.
He'll hurt you...
carelessly,
cruelly,
constantly.
Does daddy know
that you love him?
Yes. I have
told him repeatedly
that I cannot live without him.
If you're so upset with him,
why are you making
his favorite pie?
Because after
all of these years,
I've forgotten
how to wear my mask.
So now I must do things
to distract daddy.
Like this pie.
When I bring it out,
he'll be so excited,
he won't notice
the devastation in my eyes.
Devastation?
Mm-hmm. It's an emotion.
The kind you might feel
when your friend calls
to say your husband's LeSabre
was seen in the parking lot
of a certain motel,
next to
his secretary's bonneville.
Practice your mask.
Oh, no.
Honey, that's too much.
All you need is
the hint of a smile.
Perfect.
When an expression like that,
no one will ever know
what you're really thinking.
And I'll have power over men?
God, I hope so.
Why are you angry?
Who says I'm angry?
After all these years,
you don't think I can read you?
Well, if I'm such an open book,
what am I angry about?
So you admit you're angry.
I admit no such thing.
You know...
this thing you're doing...
and what thing would that be?
You put on this plastic face
to keep me in the dark about
what you're really feeling.
A-and I walk around
on eggshells for days,
not knowing which end is up.
Well, maybe I don't feel safe
sharing every single thought
and emotion I have with you.
Hmm.
Well, that's a horrible thing
to say.
Of course you can feel safe
with me.
I'm your husband.
I love you.
Please.
Okay.
After dessert,
you paid a certain...
compliment to Gabrielle.
You gotta be kidding.
It was hurtful.
To who?
To me.
You told her she was the most
gorgeous woman you'd ever met.
She was a model.
I don't care.
You don't say that with your
wife standing right next to you.
I'm going to bed.
Now?
You wanted to know
what I was feeling.
I'm feeling...
hurt and humiliated.
And I think you're dumb
to feel those things.
Are you coming to bed?
Or are you just gonna
stay down here and pout?
Actually, I was just
thinking about my mother...
and how insightful she was.
Insightful about what?
I'll be right along.
I just want to, uh...
tidy up first.
Okay.
Oh, and, Rex?
I'll be serving Belgian waffles
for breakfast.
Wow.
They're my favorite.
Mm.
Sorry to keep you waiting.
It's quite all right.
Although I'm still
a little unclear
as to why you brought me here.
Have you ever met a man
by the name of ramon Sanchez?
No, I don't believe I have.
Why?
He disappeared from his home
a few months ago.
And we just got a tip
that he's dead.
Oh, my.
You say you never met him?
Ramon Sanchez. No, that name
doesn't ring a bell.
Well, you see,
because of this tip,
someone out there is accusing
you of killing Mr. Sanchez.
Oh, good heavens.
That's just silly.
And as it happens,
Mr. Sanchez was found
exactly
where the tipster said
he would be.
And was he...
Dead?
Yes, ma'am.
What a shame.
Because you have been identified
as Mr. Sanchez's killer...
you had no choice but to
bring me in for questioning.
I understand.
So I have to ask you...
Did you kill him?
Absolutely not.
I must say,
you are hard to read.
Thank you.
What a lovely compliment.
You think that's a compliment?
I was raised to be composed
at all times.
This is obviously
a very stressful situation...
finding myself accused
of a horrific crime.
And the fact
that you would think
that I'm comporting myself
with a measure of grace
and dignity...
Well, that's a thoughtful thing
to say. You're very sweet.
Now do you have
any other questions?
I hate to rush you,
but I'm late for the funeral
of a very dear friend.
Hmm.
I can't think of a thing.
Well, it was lovely
meeting you,
and I do hope you find out
what happened to Mr. Sanchez.
I'm sure we will.
See? What did I tell you?
She's something all right.
I'm just not sure what we got
by bringing her down here.
We got her fingerprints.
"I am the resurrection and the life..."
As Susan listened
to the kind words the minister
had to say about Mike,
she found herself at a loss.
She knew people wanted
to hear from her,
but she had no idea
what she wanted to say.
I can't believe
you're making me do this.
Oh, wait. I think
what you mean to say is,
"Susan, sweet, wonderful Susan,
"thank you for marrying me
and allowing me the honor
of carrying your beautiful
behind inside our house."
You are so drunk right now.
No, I am not. I'm just...
Oh, I've never been
this happy in my life.
I feel like I could float.
I wish you could.
Aah!
Oh.
Yeah, I'm happy, too.
That's it?
"I'm happy"?
Well, that covers it.
What do you want from me?
I'm not a big... word guy.
Okay. Come on, mister...
Strong and silent.
What?
Write me a poem.
Oh, leave me alone
with this stuff.
It's my wedding night,
and I want a poem.
Come on. Let's go.
All I remember is this thing
from when I was a kid.
I'll take it.
Give me my poem, husband.
I love you once.
I love you twice.
I love you more
than beans and rice.
Oh.
Now that is a poem. Oh.
It's really smart
you guys are doing this.
When people die without a will,
it can be a nightmare.
You okay, honey?
Of course I'm okay.
We're about to talk
about us dying
for the next two days.
If it makes you feel any better,
nobody enjoys this.
I'm shocked to hear that.
You got any cancer pamphlets
in there?
In case we finish early.
Susan, come on.
This is important.
We got the baby coming.
We got the house.
I'm not saying
a will isn't important.
I'm saying
it's a beautiful day.
We should take a walk
or something
and deal with
this dying stuff...
on a nice, dreary, rainy day.
Um, bathroom's right there, Bob.
I don't need
to use the bathroom.
Or maybe I do.
Okay. What is it?
We're jinxing us.
By doing this, we're telling
death, "come on in."
No, it's when you don't do this
that it's a jinx.
Look, I'm a plumber,
and it's always
the people that don't have
homeowner's insurance
whose toilets explode.
Is it what they eat?
Missing my point.
No, avoiding your point.
Go wash your hands.
Please?
We'll do it Saturday.
I promise.
Look, I know it's tough,
but indulge me, okay?
Because if something happens,
there's nothing
more important to me
than knowing that you
and you...
are taken care of.
Bob, come on!
We're not paying you
to go to the bathroom.
Oh, this is
what I'm talking about.
None of that kobe beef, arugula,
and goat cheese nonsense.
Give me good old-fashioned
ground beef,
American cheese,
and iceberg lettuce any day.
Well, I am glad you're happy,
but I am not sure
that any burger is
worth a half-hour drive
in the car.
That's just 'cause
you haven't taken a bite yet.
Juanita said Mrs. Van de Kamp's
boyfriend got killed by a car.
Uh, yes.
Yes, he did.
Um...
and it was an accident.
It was very sad.
But you don't have to worry.
As long as we remember
to look both ways
before we cross the street,
that'll never happen to us.
Where do we go when we die?
Well, you know,
we go to heaven.
I know, but does everyone go?
Everyone you know
will go to heaven.
What about animals?
Animals go to heaven, too.
What about bugs?
Bugs are annoying.
We don't want bugs in heaven.
What about the animals
that eat the bugs?
Won't they starve?
You're right.
There are bugs in heaven.
But if all the people
and all the animals
and all the bugs that ever lived
go to heaven,
isn't it super crowded?
No, sweetie.
Heaven is perfect.
How is it perfect?
I mean, what's it like?
You wanna jump in here?
Buddy, this is heaven.
It is?
Sure. Sitting with the people
you love more than
anything in the world,
eating a double cheeseburger
and fries... it's gotta be heaven.
You know what else is heaven?
What?
That place we fish.
Near the waterfall?
Yep. Heaven.
And when we watch football
together
and mom brings us
trays of snacks.
That's heaven, too?
If heaven is supposed to be
the happiest place you can be,
don't all those places
sound like it to you?
What are hamburgers
made out of?
'Cause I know they're not ham.
Thank you for coming
to help honor
Mike Delfino's life.
The family invites you
to join them at the cemetery.
Uh...
I changed my mind.
Hi.
I-I wasn't, uh,
planning to say anything
because, uh...
I had absolutely no idea
what to say.
Mike and I never talked about
what he wanted for a funeral.
I think it's because, um...
Well, you know Mike.
He... wasn't really
much of a talker.
Some of you,
as you came by to hug me today,
you said that
he's in a better place.
And you know what? I...
I realize now...
He is.
He... is in a diner...
eating cheeseburgers
with his family...
And he's fishing
at a waterfall...
and he's watching football
with his son,
yelling like a maniac.
So...
Since he has to be in...
all those wonderful places...
I'm going to have to say
good-bye to him now.
Good-bye, Mike.
I love you once.
I love you twice.
Oh.
I love you more
than beans and rice.
You know what?
Mike was right.
This was the best freaking
burger I've ever had in my life.
You got that right.
Susan, you haven't eaten
a thing. Aren't you starving?
0-5-1-6-0-2.
I-I just remembered...
it's Mike's password
for his voice mail.
I have to call
the cell phone company,
or they're gonna charge us
for an extra month.
I can do that for you.
I will call them
first thing tomorrow morning.
M.J. signed... up
for pitching
for little league this year.
Mike was supposed to teach him.
Oh, honey, I'll send Carlos over
to coach him.
I gave him two girls who hate
sports, so he'll be thrilled.
Mike was always
checking the tires on our car
with this thingy.
I don't know
where the thingy is.
I just know it was important
and it kept us safe.
Hey. Hey. Tom's still
taking care of our cars.
I'll just tell him to add yours
to his to-do list from now on.
Oh.
Susan, we are gonna do
everything we can
to hold you up, okay?
Okay.
Yes, as much as death
takes from us,
it also gives.
It teaches us
what's truly important...
like giving back
after a lifetime of taking...
going after something
we never
should have let go of...
or looking back
on what made us who we are.
But sometimes the lessons
learned after a person's death
aren't the ones we expected.
Forensics says
the prints on the mug
match the prints we found
on the dead guy.
Whole time she was dating Chuck,
I never trusted her.
You think we got enough
to arrest her?
Probably.
Let's hold off.
I wanna make sure we get enough
to put this bitch away for good.

Previously on...
At Mike's funeral,
Susan and M.J. said good-bye.
Gaby gave her blessing.
You should quit your job.
If being a counselor
is gonna make you happy,
then that's what you should do.
Lynette spoke her mind
about Tom's girlfriend...
I actually don't think
it's gonna last that much longer.
And the police gathered more evidence.
Someone is accusing you
of killing Mr. Sanchez.
That's just silly.
I wanna make sure we get enough
to put this bitch away for good.
Renee Perry had waited
many months for a proposal,
and for many months,
she had been disappointed.
There had been cozy evening by the fire...
that didn't go the way she had hoped.
A romantic moment in Wisteria park...
that wasn't so romantic after all.
And a beautiful picnic by a lake...
that turned out to be
nothing more than a picnic.
So when disappointment struck again...
Renee decided to speak up.
Dessert?
That's the big finale to a 6-course meal?
Dessert?
Were you expecting, like, a cheese course?
No!
I was expecting a ring.
You have red roses, champagne.
You are sending me every
signal in the world
that I'm about to get a big proposal
and instead, I get a cookie.
Well, it's a chocolate souffle.
Whatever. I am not a young woman.
I don't know how many more
fake outs my heart can take.
Okay, fine. I-I was gonna propose tonight.
I just did such a horrible
job the first time,
I-I... I wanted this to be exceptional.
They call it "Popping the question,"
not "Dragging it out to eternity,"
so come on! Pop!
Can I at least, uh,
read you the speech that I wrote?
Oh, Lord. Just give me the last paragraph.
Okay.
"For all these reasons and more,"
"it is with great honor,
that I ask you if you"...
Uh, we're ignoring that. Keep going.
"i-if you would consider making me"
"the happiest man in the"...
Go away!
It's the police.
We're looking for Mr. Ben Faulkner.
I'm Ben Faulkner. How can I help you?
You own the condominium project
under construction at Chapman woods?
I used to. Bank owns it now.
You mind coming down
to the station with us?
I want to ask you about
a body we found on the site.
Is... he under arrest?
No, ma'am. We just want to ask
you boyfriend a few questions.
Wait!
He's not my boyfriend. He's my fiance.
Yes, Renee Perry had waited
a long time for a proposal...
Okay. Now you can take him.
And she wasn't about to let
it slip through her fingers.
Bree Van de Kamp started every morning
by catching up on the latest news,
but sometimes the news came
from an unexpected source.
Hey, Bree. Look what happened to my hand.
Oh, my goodness!
Are you...
We're getting married.
Oh, how wonderful!
Yeah, we're pretty happy.
"Pretty happy"?
Oh, we're ecstatic. Knickers to the wind.
Over the moon.
Congratulations. When did this happen?
Last night. Oh, and get this...
In the middle of his big,
romantic proposal,
the cops come by to ask
about some dead body
they found at the construction site.
So tell me more.
Well, I definitely want a big wedding.
Bridesmaids, the works.
I was talking about the body.
What did the police say?
Uh, not much. You know, I told them
that I didn't know anything about it,
and they believed me.
Good.
Although I have to say,
I'm surprised you didn't tell me sooner.
You know...
Oh, we're sorry. Uh, it was late,
And I wanted to tell my sister first.
Again, talking about the body.
Why would we tell you that?
And why are we talking
about this and not me?
Quite right. I-I just would
hate to see this tragic news
interfere with your happy day.
And I don't think it will,
but I really don't think
you should worry about it.
Uh, the police don't seem like
they're gonna pose a problem.
That was judge Kemp.
He just signed off on that warrant.
For Bree Van de Kamp?
That was fast.
I might've called in some favors.
The sooner I can prove she's guilty,
the sooner I can watch her pay for it.
We got another one. Um, Mitzi Kinsky.
"Mike was a ray of sunshine on our street."
"He will be missed dearly."
Isn't that lovely?
Everybody's been so generous.
Yeah. Ten jars of homemade jam.
I don't know if she was being generous
or just cleaning out her basement.
Well, either way,
it's a gesture of love and support.
Makes me feel better.
There is my baby boy.
Morning, bub.
Eggs on a raft,
just the way you like 'em.
These smell gross.
Okay, um, not a problem.
Is there something else you'd like me to...
M.J.
It's okay, honey.
Um, what do you want?
Strawberry ice cream.
Uh, buddy, I don't think
that's the healthiest way
to start your day.
I don't care what you think.
Well...
Maybe just this once.
I'll get you a bowl.
Or, uh, no bowl is good.
I'm gonna eat this in front of the TV.
Can you bring me some sprinkles?
Of course, honey.
Uh, mom.
What? It's just ice cream, okay?
He lost his dad.
Okay.
Mom, where's my sprinkles?
Coming!
What's... going on here?
I thought I'd kick off
your big resignation day
with a power breakfast.
Plus the expiration on
this sausage was yesterday.
I gotta say,
now that the day is finally here,
I'm starting to get a little freaked out.
Don't you worry.
I've made a decision.
I'm getting a job.
What? You don't have to do that.
No, I want to. It's time I help out.
I owe it to you.
So I wrote up a resume,
I booked a meeting
at an employment agency,
and I even bought myself
a girlie briefcase.
But I thought we were just gonna cut back,
live a smaller life?
Yeah, I thought about that.
Then I decided I want
a slightly bigger life,
So I figure if I work,
the girls can stay in private school,
we can keep both cars,
and maybe even take
one of those ski trips
we talked about canceling.
Gaby, I love that you're trying to help,
but an entry-level salary is not
gonna cover the cost of skis,
let alone five nights at the Ritz.
Well, maybe not now,
but if I work my way up the ladder,
in a few years, I'll be
pulling in the big bucks,
just like you do.
Or did.
What kind of ladder are
we talking about here?
What is it that you're gonna do?
I don't know yet. That's where
the employment lady comes in.
She's gonna help me figure out
How to best utilize my "Skill set."
Yeah, I read that one
in your business magazines.
I'm proud of you stepping up like this.
I hope you find a job
that has health care,
'cause my benefits end today.
What?
No risky meat without benefits.
Yeah, Doug and I eloped,
so this time, I want an
over-the-top wedding...
horse-drawn carriages, fireworks,
poodles dyed purple.
Uh, is this weird,
me going on about how happy I am
while you're all sad and single?
Actually, I'm hoping
I won't be single for long.
I've decided to try to get Tom back.
So we're done talking about me?
Yeah. Kinda.
Great.
So what are you thinking?
I figure I'll just come clean,
tell him I screwed up,
and beg him to come back.
It's amazing you landed
a man in the first place.
Well, what do you think I should do?
Oh. Throw yourself at him.
Next time he stops by,
let a boob fall out of your blouse
or maybe bend over in
those tight-ass jeans.
That's not gonna work.
You're right. Sorry.
What do I know about getting a man?
Oh, wait.
A lot.
Come on. Help.
It's not gonna be easy splitting them up.
They just moved in together
and they seem so happy.
Of course they're happy.
They're in that honeymoon phase.
They're still taking trips,
laughing at each other's jokes,
pretending they're interested in museums.
We had a honeymoon phase, too.
Maybe I need to remind him of that.
Well, remind him naked.
The only tricky part is
gonna be getting him alone.
Jane watches him like a hawk,
a tall, bitchy hawk.
Well, whatever you do, do it soon.
I'm not gonna waste
a plus one at my wedding
unless I know it's serious.
Hey. Mom?
Andrew!
It's wonderful to see you. How are you?
I'm good. I'm good. I'm really good.
Really? Because your sister
told me you lost your job.
I've been so worried.
Didn't you get any of the messages I left?
I've just been really busy.
Uh, but everything's fine.
In fact, I met someone.
You did? That's wonderful.
I know how hard
your breakup from Alex was.
I'm so happy that you're moving on.
Yeah, well, you know,
it's only been a few months,
but, uh, it's pretty serious.
How serious?
Serious enough that
we were driving through town,
and I thought the two of you should meet.
He's here?
Uh, yeah, well, I...
I want you to keep an open mind.
Who's this?
This is Mary Beth,
my fiancee.
I'm so glad to finally meet you.
I've been telling this guy
I can't marry him until I meet his mom.
So you're really engaged
to... each other?
Uh, yeah.
Yeah, and remember,
you're happy I've moved on, right?
I just have so many questions.
I know what you must be thinking.
It's too soon.
No, that's not what I'm thinking.
Mom.
I'm sorry. It's just that
you're very different
than all of the other...
dates Andrew's brought home.
Well, you know, people change.
So how did you two meet anyway?
Oh, it's a real cute story.
I was at the community center
for my overeaters anonymous meeting,
but I went into
the A.A. meeting by mistake.
And by "Mistake,"
I mean I remembered how
drunks love their doughnuts.
So as I was reaching for
a buttermilk glazed,
there was Andrew.
You were in overeaters anonymous?
Yeah, I actually lost 220 pounds
and then gained 160 pounds
of grade "A" beefcake!
Isn't she adorable?
Uh-huh.
Andrew, would you help me in the kitchen?
I'd like to get some tea biscuits,
and they're on a very high shelf.
Ooh, tea biscuits.
46 calories.
Andrew, I do not understand.
What is going on here?
Look, I-I know it's not
who you were expecting,
but remember how you always said
that being gay was just a phase,
that I-I just needed
to meet the right girl?
Well, you were right.
Just be happy for me.
Come on. Back to bed.
M.J., it is 2:00 in the morning.
You should be in bed.
You can't tell me what to do.
What did you just say to me?
Hey. Turn that back on!
Mnh-mnh.
Guys?
What's going on in here?
I am trying to get M.J. back to bed.
I can't sleep.
Yeah, well, blowing up
aliens isn't gonna help.
Come on.
No, I wanna play my game.
Turn it back on now!
Shh. Shh. Don't get upset.
You can finish your game.
What?
Just for a little while,
then you have to go back to bed, okay?
Mom, can I talk to you for a second?
I think you're making a mistake.
It's not that big a deal.
Yes, it is.
Look, I know what
he's going through is awful,
but this isn't helping.
He's totally taking advantage of you.
He's not taking advantage.
He's traumatized,
and it's killing me to see
what he's going through,
so if I can give him a little joy
by letting him play video games,
that's what I'm gonna do.
So I'm looking to make
in the 6-figure range,
plus benefits, of course.
And I have two young girls,
so flexible hours would be good.
And we always take this big vacation,
so I'll need two weeks off. Maybe three.
You know what? Just give me all of august.
So what do you got for me?
A reality check.
Excuse me?
Mrs. Solis, you're gonna have
to adjust your expectations.
Up?
No. Have you not been
reading the newspapers?
The job market right now is brutal.
I have people with PhDs
that I can't find jobs for,
and frankly, your job
experience is very limited.
Modeling, modeling, modeling.
Okay. Okay. Okay.
Print,
runway,
boat show.
Who's the job expert here?
Plus, there's a 15-year gap here.
Yeah, to be a doting wife
and a loving mother of two.
You have experience with children.
I have a job at a day care center.
And deal with other people's kids?
I don't even like my own.
Look, you didn't go to college,
you didn't even graduate high school,
and your only references are
photographers and aging rock stars.
In today's market,
you're basically unemployable.
And you actually get paid for this?
So now what am I supposed to do?
Well, you could start planning
that august vacation.
Gabrielle Solis was depressed,
and when she was depressed,
nothing lifted her spirits
like a good workout...
of her credit card.
May I help you?
Yeah, uh, I just wanna get that
little red scarf I saw in the window.
Then I'll be on my way.
All right.
Although that...
black sheath dress would
go perfect with it.
Mm.
Look at those over-the-knee boots!
Okay. Who am I kidding?
Get me a double cappuccino
and a muscular stock boy.
Mama needs a new pair of everything.
I said taupe. This is clearly beige.
We don't have it in taupe.
Second floor, third mannequin
from the left. Look alive.
I'll try these in plum,
these in leopard,
these... oh, forget it.
No lady wants to see
anything under 4 inches.
You go with you. You go with you.
You go away.
No one's been able to
make that romper work.
Should we help her?
Stay back. She knows what she's doing.
Navy blazer, silver hoop earrings,
platform wedge.
And a red patent leather clutch.
Genius! Genius.
Everything looks and smells so amazing,
Mrs. Van de Kamp.
Do you mind if I take a picture?
Of the food?
That way I eat just a little bit now,
and then later, when I'm hungry,
I can look at the picture
and get full on the memory.
Don't you just wanna eat her up?
Not before I take a picture of her.
You know, Mary Beth,
I just realized I don't
know a thing about you.
What do you do?
Well, actually, nothing.
My parents have been pretty generous.
Oh, really? What, uh,
sort of work are they in?
None of your business, mom.
No, no. It's okay.
They invented Mary Beth's frozen custard.
Mary Beth? You're that Mary Beth?
Recognize me? The kid on the carton?
It's in every supermarket in the country.
It must be a multibillion dollar...
Oh.
Would you help me in the kitchen, Andrew?
Now.
Andrew, I knew you were
having financial troubles,
but I never thought you'd stoop to this.
What?
She's an heiress.
You're obviously marrying her
for her money.
I'm marrying her because
I'm crazy about her.
We love the same movies.
She makes me laugh.
She gets me. She's really an amazing girl.
I think I found your good side!
Smile, gnocchi.
She's disturbed.
Okay. All right. She's a little eccentric,
but you know what? I love her.
Andrew Van de Kamp,
you love italian shoes.
You love mid-century modern furniture.
And according to
your internet history, you love...
army doctors giving elaborate
physicals to young recruits.
But you do not love girls.
Why can't you accept that I've changed?
Because homosexuality is not a choice.
You were born this way.
I'm the one who told you that.
And it took me a long time,
but I was finally able to
wrap my head around it.
Honey, you're here, you're queer,
and I'm used to it.
You know what, mom?
I'm not here anymore, all right?
Mary Beth, let's go.
Hey.
How was your dad's?
Fine.
Aw!
She was in a bit of a mood,
but I still love you unconditionally.
Let me guess... did it have something to do
with a certain Taylor Swift
concert this Thursday night?
I'm just saying,
all my friends' moms are taking them.
And all your friends' moms are
gonna be deaf for two weeks,
like I was the last time
I went to a concert.
I'm not doing it.
It's not fair.
I am gonna go give Paige a bath.
Thank you for bringing her home.
I'm gonna go grab your suitcase.
Mom! Please!
It'd make you the bestest
mom in the whole wide world!
Nope. The matter is closed.
This sucks.
Hey.
You know who else likes Taylor Swift?
Me.
I mean, if your parents are okay
with it, I'll take you.
Oh, my god!
Oh!
You're the best! I'll check
with my mom and call you?
Can't wait.
Okay!
So?
Totally worked.
You'll have dad all to yourself
Thursday night.
You are the bestest girl
in the whole wide world.
Gaby!
Hi, babe.
What is that?
This?
It's a boot.
I bought a boot.
You bought... one boot?
Yep. 'Cause I'm frugal.
One day I'll buy the other one.
That's all you bought?
Because I got a call from the bank.
Seems somebody was going crazy
with your credit card.
Huh. Maybe it was stolen.
Yeah.
By a size 0 with
incredibly expensive taste.
What is this shopping bag
doing under the bed?
I bought a gift for a woman
whose husband is in Iraq,
fighting for our freedom.
Gaby! You're taking it all back.
I can't.
Not if I've worn it.
Can't take it back.
Can't take it back now.
See? It's all...
Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop!
Our lives have changed.
We can't afford this anymore.
Not unless you got some big
job you haven't told me about.
What's wrong?
I met with that job lady.
But she basically said
I'm not qualified to do anything.
I didn't finish school.
I've never had a real job.
The only thing I've ever gotten
paid for is being pretty.
I just feel like my life
has been one bad decision after another.
Uh... what about the girls?
What about marrying me?
That's the part that hurts the most.
You guys are the only good thing
I've ever done,
and I feel like I'm letting you down.
Gaby...
you are smart.
You'll figure something out,
something great.
But in the meantime,
all these clothes
have to go back.
I know.
Could you just give us a moment alone?
Hello?
Yes, this is his mother.
He did what?
He threw a stapler at you?
Yes, right at my head.
Are you sure it wasn't an accident?
He couldn't have been aiming at your head.
What he said was...
and I wrote this down
because I wanted to be exact...
"Leave me alone,"
"or I'm going to throw
this stapler at your head."
I-I'm so sorry.
You do know that M.J.
just lost his father, right?
I do. My heart goes out to both of you.
But there is no place for
violence in my classroom,
no matter what
the circumstances are at home.
"Circumstances"?
Um...
I mean, it's not like
he just lost his favorite toy
or a pet turtle.
He... lost his dad.
Yes, but if M.J. had thrown
that stapler a little harder,
my grandkids might have lost
their grandmother.
Well, I'm sure that he is sorry.
He isn't. In fact, he said... and I quote...
"Bull's-eye."
I'm considering having him
removed from my class.
Okay. Uh...
What M.J. did was wrong,
but... I'm finding it hard to believe
that a person that spends
so much time with children
could be so oblivious to a child's pain.
I have 20 other children
I need to protect.
And M.J. is a very angry little boy.
Well, of course he's angry.
He's 9,
and one of the most important
and loving people
in his life has just been
ripped away from him,
and now he has to live with the fact
that his father is never coming back.
Inside voices, please.
Oh, to hell with your "Inside voices."
His father is dead.
My husband is dead!
Oh! My foot.
It's her.
Why is everyone looking at me?
Did I do something wrong?
No. No, in fact, we have done nothing
but talk about your shopping skills
for the last 24 hours.
Really?
Yes. We even went back
and watched the security tape
to see it again.
Well, keep the tape. It was my last show.
What?
Uh, circumstances have changed.
My shopping days are over.
So just do me a favor.
Wait till I'm gone to restock the boots.
I can't cry again today.
Uh, wait. Wait.
Take care of these for Mrs. Solis
and bring her a glass of champagne.
Champagne?
Mm-hmm.
Did you not hear me? I'm broke.
You have no reason to
suck up to me anymore.
Well, I do if I want you to work here.
Huh?
You see, you're like a...
a shopping savant,
and every day, women come in here
with all the money in the world
and no clue what to spend it on.
You could help them.
You mean like a personal shopper job?
No, do not think of it as a job.
For you, my dear, it is a calling.
I don't know.
Employees get a 40% discount.
Hi. Welcome to Cumberly's.
My name's Gabrielle. Can I help you?
I want to thank you
for accepting my apology
and coming over before you left town.
I feel like I haven't had
the appropriate reaction
to this wedding.
No. No, no, you've been wonderful.
Well,
to show you how excited I am that
my little boy is getting married,
I've thrown you
a surprise engagement party.
Mom, what the hell is this?
Oh, I just invited some
of your old friends over
to congratulate you.
Hey, girl. I haven't seen you in ages.
Those shoes are ferosh.
Who's this hag?
This is Andrew's fiancee Mary Beth.
Hi, Mary Beth. I'm Brian with an "I."
This is Bryan with a "Y."
What is this about you getting
married? We need to dish.
Um, uh, sweetie, why don't...
why don't you go in
the kitchen and grab a drink?
I just love those boys.
They used to be here all the time.
So what did you think of Andrew's friends?
They seem sweet and very well-groomed.
Well, yeah, but don't they seem,
I don't know, a little... disco-y?
Mrs. Van de Kamp, I know Andrew's gay.
You do?
We've never actually made love,
and he has a picture of
Michael Phelps next to his bed.
Says it's patriotic, but...
I don't understand.
If you know about him...
You have to understand,
I grew up fat and lonely.
When I lost all the weight,
I thought men would look at me
differently, but they didn't.
I just kind of gave up.
Oh, Mary Beth.
But then I met Andrew. He's sweet, fun,
and I just thought...
I could do a lot worse.
No. No. No. Now you listen to me.
You deserve real romance
and passion in your life.
I know all about this.
I have been with plenty
of men for companionship
when it should've been for love.
The right man for you
is out there somewhere.
You just can't settle.
It's not fair to you or to Andrew.
I think we need to talk.
All right.
Coming! Coming! Coming!
Okay.
Oh, no.
Hey.
Hey. I-I came as soon
as I got your message.
So power's out, huh?
I know. This is so embarrassing.
I just got off the phone
with the electric company,
and it turns out it's a faulty line,
so they're gonna fix it first
thing tomorrow morning.
So you don't need me to
look at anything or...
I'm sorry. I feel terrible dragging you
all the way over here,
so you want something for
your trouble? A drink or...
Nah. No. No. I don't...
I don't want to be in your hair.
No, no. You're not.
Honestly, it's a little scary
being all alone in a dark house.
Hence the hundreds of candles.
Yeah, I did go a little overboard, huh?
What are you cooking?
It smells amazing in here.
Yeah? I'm trying out
a new recipe for the kids.
Beef bourguignon.
But Penny's with Jane
and Parker's having pizza
with the Martindales.
I love beef bourguignon.
Oh, that's right. I totally forgot.
Y-you remember the first time we tried it?
New York. Our second anniversary.
Oh, that must be where I got the idea.
I was just looking at
pictures from that trip.
Oh, yeah? You-you got
out the old photo album?
Yeah.
Oh, ho ho. Man!
Look at us.
Hey.
Why don't you stay for dinner?
I'll make you a plate.
Yeah, I don't know.
Come on. Jane's at the concert.
What would you rather do...
eat a microwave dinner all
alone in your apartment or...
beef bourguignon?
Well...
I hate for it to go to waste.
Well, I hope you're happy.
Mary Beth is on her way back to Wisconsin.
I'm sorry.
Why are you so concerned about her life?
What about me?! I'm your son.
I did this for you.
Can you look me in the eye
and tell me you would've been happy
spending the rest of
your life with that woman?
That marriage really
could have helped me out,
and you have no idea how much help I need.
Why? What is going on?
Where do I start? Um...
Well, I took a loss on
the house that you got me,
I, uh, I lost my job,
can't find a new one.
I have a ton of credit card debt,
and Mary Beth was willing to
help me out with all of that.
Well, so would I. Why didn't
you come to me for help?
Do you know what it feels like
to have to keep running back
to your mother to fix your problems?
My whole life,
you've been propping me up...
when I needed a job, when I was dumped,
when I was drinking.
I'm just... I'm so tired
of you seeing me as a failure.
Andrew, if you would
go through all of this
rather than come to me for help,
then I am the one who's failed.
How about we just agree
that we both failed?
So what are you gonna do now?
I don't know. I had a
pretty good setup there...
a place to live, somebody who needed me,
all the frozen custard I could eat.
Well, I don't have any custard,
but I can offer you a place to stay,
and... someone else who needs you.
All right.
But just until I get
back on my feet again.
Now let's talk about that party.
I could swear I saw Bryan with
a "Y" checking you out.
Ah, well, actually,
I am more into Geoffrey with a "G."
Now that's my gay son.
God, look at all the stuff we're doing.
We used to be interesting.
I know. We-we hiked.
We went to the theater.
We-we took salsa lessons.
And then came the kids.
Ah, fun killers. Huh.
Mmm. This is amazing.
It's even better than that
restaurant in New York.
I don't know. That place was pretty good.
How did we even find it?
You don't remember?
Mnh-mnh.
We got caught in that torrential downpour.
We ducked in there to dry off.
Right. And then the owner insisted
on making us a special meal
because we had that newlywed look.
A lot of water under that bridge, huh?
Yeah, but it was a pretty strong bridge.
Look how young we were.
Yeah.
Back then I could actually see
without my reading glasses.
Here you go. Best I can do for light.
Thank you.
Ha ha ha.
I'm glad you kept these.
Good memories, huh?
Yeah.
You know, sometimes you just get...
overwhelmed by work and...
kids and life, and it's just...
so easy to...
forget.
Yeah.
Yeah, it is.
I'm on fire.
Oh, my god. Oh, my god! I'on fire!
Oh! Oh, my god! Oh!
Are you okay?
I think I burnt the skin.
Oh, jeez. Let me see.
Oh, it doesn't look so bad.
I thought the power was out.
They must have... fixed it.
You set this up.
You know, in-in my defense, I...
What the hell is going on?
I just wanted to see where we stood,
if there was still anything between us,
if we could find our way back
to those people in the pictures.
By tricking me?
I'm-I'm sorry about how I did it,
but you can't deny what just happened.
You still feel something.
Jane just moved in with me,
and you do this now?
Hey mom.
Hey. How was the concert?
Awesome.
How'd it go with dad?
Not so awesome.
Yeah, I kinda got that
from the sweatpants.
Mm. Come here, you.
Hi.
Mm. Hi.
So now what?
I... don't know.
Well, I'll tell you what you can't do.
Give up.
Taylor Swift has this song...
"You belong with me." It's...
about how she won't stop loving this guy
even though he's with the wrong girl.
And when she sang it tonight,
all I could think about was you and dad.
And this guy she loves...
does he eventually come to his senses?
It wouldn't be a very
good video if he didn't.
And don't worry.
Dad will, too.
You think?
Mom, you're fighting for him.
What guy doesn't like that?
You know...
when you say something
really smart like that,
it makes me think I did a really good job.
You think it's gonna blister?
It's a first-degree burn.
Tom, you'll be fine.
But as your physician,
let me recommend...
no more candlelit baths alone.
Yeah, I don't know what I was thinking.
Well, the good news is I can
declare you healthy enough
for any and all sexual activity.
Actually...
I need to get some work done.
Okay.
Well, the nice thing about
us living together...
if you change your mind,
you know where to find me.
Okay.
That's the last of them.
Okay.
Actually, we're not done here.
I want to talk to you.
Is this about what happened at school?
Yes.
You need to know that it is never okay
to throw a stapler at someone.
I know.
It's also never okay
to sweep a bunch of
stuff off someone's desk
because you don't like what
they're saying about your son.
Particularly if they've
just had bunion surgery.
You did that to Mrs. Butters?
I'm not proud of it, but yeah.
I was really mad.
Just like you.
M.J., something horrible happened to you,
and every time you started
to get angry about it,
I wanted to cover it up with
ice cream or video games,
but the truth is,
we shouldn't cover it up.
We should let it out.
Now we can't hurt people...
but we can...
hurt jam.
Mom!
People sent us this to
help us feel better,
and it's going to,
just not in the way they thought.
Come on, buddy.
You got a lot to be angry about.
What happened... sucks.
Oh, sweetie.
I love you.
I love you.
I love you so much.
That's a cake I made for a
wedding a few years ago.
I know what you're gonna say.
It's too extravagant.
It's not big enough.
Oh. Well, I suppose
we could add another tier.
Make it two.
I really appreciate this, Bree.
Ben is such a guy.
He's not gonna be any help
planning this wedding.
Yes, especially since he's dealing
with the nasty business of the body.
Oh, that? No, Ben's in the clear.
Really?
Yeah, the cops called this morning.
Uh, they figured out the guy they found
died eight months ago.
That was way before Ben
started construction.
Yeah, the cops think the guy
was just some poor drifter.
Anyway, it's over.
Oh, good.
Well, now we can focus all our energy
on giving you the best
wedding in the world.
Tomorrow we'll start our planning.
Yes, in life,
when we see an opportunity,
we have to take it,
whether it's the hope
of winning back the love of our life...
a shot at proving our worth...
or the chance to show a
child the right path.
But sometimes when we answer the call...
Hello?
Hi. It's Bree.
We have no idea what
opportunity awaits us.
Renee just told me the good news,
and I wanted to thank you
for keeping my secret.
Ah, no worries. I told you I would.
I know but even when suspicion
moved on to you,
you still protected me,
and that's very honorable.
Really, it was no big deal.
Maybe not to you.
You're not the one who
put a body in the ground.
You have to understand,
a day doesn't go by
when that does not weigh
heavily on my conscience.
Gotcha.

Previously on...
"Desperate Housewives"
Renee had good news.
We're getting married.
Oh, how wonderful.
Gaby's talent for shopping
became an opportunity.
The personal shopper job?
For you, my dear,
it is a calling.
Things heated up
between Tom and Lynette.
Oh, my God. I'm on fire!
Oh!
Aah! Oh!
M.J. and Susan began
their recovery
after Mike's death.
Oh, sweetie.
The police questioned Bree
and advanced their case.
Judge Kemp just signed off
on that warrant.
That was fast.
Sooner I can prove
she's guilty,
sooner I can watch her
pay for it.
When it came
to throwing a bridal shower,
Bree Van de Kamp believed
that everything should be done
with taste and dignity.
There should be
personalized party favors...
Delicate pastel flowers...
elegant refreshments...
and she insisted
on traditional gifts,
even if they received
an untraditional response.
What the hell? Mixing bowls?
Nesting mixing bowls.
Come on. This is a shower.
Isn't there one gift over there
that's, uh,
you know, buzzing?
Oh! I know just the one.
Oh, here we go.
I use mine all the time.
I used to do it by hand,
but this gets the job done
so much faster.
Ah. Now we're talking.
It's a brand-new...
immersion blender?
Now you can puree soups
right in the pot.
So is every gift gonna be
kitchen-related?
Well, that's the theme
that I had letterpressed
on the invitations.
Okay, I might have to send
someone out on a beer run.
Well, I am sorry to disappoint
you, but if you're looking
for that kind of shower,
you're in the wrong place.
Oh, Bree, can I talk to you
for a second?
Okay, so I had a feeling your
shower might be kind of a dud,
so I may have sort of hired
a male stripper.
Gaby, you didn't.
There he is, so yay!
No. Male strippers are
beyond degrading,
and I don't choose to be
humiliated in my own home.
Now please, get rid of them.
Bree Van de Kamp, we have
a warrant for your arrest.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. She also has
the right to remain horny.
Listen, change of plans...
Ma'am, I'm gonna need
you to stand aside.
Just take the money and go.
And tell the agency
three dumpy strippers
does not equal one hot one.
What?
You're under arrest
for the murder of Ramon Sanchez.
What? Oh, my God.
Bree, what's going on?
Oh, I'm sure it's just
a misunderstanding.
Is there anything we can do?
Yes. I just put the mini quiches
in the oven.
Would you be a dear and take
them out before they burn?
Yes, Bree Van de Kamp believed
in doing everything
with dignity...
Even in the most undignified
of circumstances.
Sometimes no matter
how much we plan...
things don't turn out
the way we expect.
A sterling reputation...
may become tarnished.
A clear explanation...
might get messy.
An ideal arrangement...
could fall apart in a flash.
And one person
may end up paying the price...
for a crime that everyone
thought was shared.
Honey, are you okay?
Yeah, thanks to Bob.
He bailed me out.
What happened?
What do they have on you?
Very little...
Orson's ridiculous letter,
which is inadmissible in court,
since he's... gone,
and a very cryptic
phone conversation
which can easily
be explained away.
Oh, thank God.
Well, they also have
Bree's fingerprint.
On what?
A button on the victim's shirt.
When we were wrapping him up
in the tablecloth,
I noticed that his shirt
was unbuttoned.
You tidied up the dead guy?
I felt it was respectful
at the time.
Obviously, I see things
differently now.
Wh...
Well, we're not gonna let her
take the blame for this.
Yeah, we're all in this together.
Whoa, whoa. Whoa. Whoa.
If we confess,
they'll find out about Carlos,
and they could put him
away forever.
So what? We let Bree
take the fall for us?
Yeah, that's not gonna happen.
No, I'm just saying, we should
think this through.
Well...
Ladies, stop.
Nothing is gonna happen to me.
The police have no case.
And of all of us,
I am in the best position
to take this on right now.
I have no job, no small children
to look after.
But you do have a halo
over your head.
Yeah, Bree.
It's incredibly generous.
Bob, you swear you're gonna
get her off, right?
Actually, she needs
a criminal defense attorney.
I know the perfect guy.
He's a real shark.
He's not cheap,
but he's worth it.
Well, obviously,
we're gonna pay for it.
Yes.
You don't have to do that.
No arguing. You are doing
something huge for us.
Well, thank you, but I promise
you, it's not going to be huge
because nothing is
going to happen.
I swear to God,
this woman is guilty.
If she walks,
I am gonna lose it.
You don't have to convince me, but
a jury's a whole nother story.
There's no motive,
no connection to the victim.
Then we have to find one,
all right? Fast.
Are you sure you're not overreacting
because she dumped your partner?
I don't think
she just dumped him.
I think she might be the reason
Chuck's dead.
Come on.
We need to keep digging.
No. No way.
Carlos!
I am not gonna let Bree
take the fall
for a crime I committed.
Okay. Wait, wait, wait.
Before you do anything stupid
and macho and Noble, just sit
your ass down and listen to me!
Or stand your ass there
and listen to me.
You can't turn yourself in.
Why not?
I'm the one who did it.
You've already been to jail
twice.
You get a third strike, they're
gonna put you away for life.
So what, I'm supposed to
send Bree in my place?
Bree's not going anywhere.
The evidence against her
is very flimsy,
and we're getting her
some hotshot defense attorney.
We?
Who is "we"?
The girls and I.
We decided since Bree's
in the hot seat, the
least we could do is
pay her legal fees.
Yeah, a... and I'm
all in favor of that, but...
How are
we supposed to afford this?
I just quit my job and I have
a lead on a nonprofit,
but it is hardly
gonna pay anything.
Okay, relax.
Relax. Sit down.
Look...
I'm working now.
No offense, but I don't think
personal shoppers
make hotshot defense attorney
money.
Okay, seriously, you need to
keep your mouth shut and lie low
until this Bree thing
plays out.
I just wish that there was
something I could do.
Carlos,
look...
this is one of those times
when the best thing you can do
is do nothing.
What about his suits?
I'm giving it all away.
It's what Mike would've wanted.
I think I'll keep these.
M.J. always says he's gotta
fill daddy's shoes.
So if I save a pair, someday...
he will know that he did.
Are you crying?
No. No.
Can you grab that stuff
on the shelf?
Yeah.
What's this?
I don't know.
Never seen it before.
Hmm. I'll grab Mike's keys.
Um, maybe you opening it
is not a good idea.
Why not?
Because it's in your house, in
your bedroom, but it's locked.
So maybe Mike didn't want you
to know what was in it.
That's ridiculous.
I have a box like this
in my house
that I would not want
Bob to see.
Why? What's in it?
No. Don't answer that.
It's probably
just papers and stuff.
You're probably right,
but if it's something else,
you may not want to know.
Well, what do you suggest I do?
Throw it away?
Keep it on the shelf?
Okay, how about this... you go
make yourself a nice cup of tea,
I will open it, and if it's
just papers, I'll tell you?
And if it's something else?
I will decide
if you should see it.
I'm just trying
to protect you, Susan.
Men have secrets.
Mike didn't.
He kinda did.
Hey, thanks for
bringing that over.
You can keep it.
Who thinks a cake stand's
a good gift for a bridal shower?
Me. I gave it to you.
Oh. Well, you owe me
a less sucky present.
And by the way, I think you guys
owe me a whole new shower.
I mean, when the host
gets arrested for murder,
it kinda puts a damper
on things.
Yeah, weird.
And what's up
with the cops in this town?
Last week, they hauled Ben
in about some body they found.
Now Bree?
I'm sure they'll straighten it
out. Thanks again for this.
Who's the cake for?
Tom.
It's his birthday tomorrow,
and I am implementing phase two
of operation get Tom back.
I'm guessing phase one
was a success.
It was great, right up
until he caught on fire
and then realized the entire
evening had been a web of lies.
But right before that,
there was this moment,
this look between us,
like we were
Tom and Lynette again.
Really?
I could see it in his eyes.
Tom still loves me.
So birthday boy,
what do you wanna do
for your big day tomorrow?
Oh, let's just, uh, go out
for dinner or something.
That's it?
I could have a party.
Invite your friends over,
open up some champagne.
Oh, you don't have to worry
about that.
The kids are throwing me
a little party Thursday.
Oh. Well, then I guess
we'll have to come up with
some other way to celebrate.
Sounds good.
Hey. Aren't you
forgetting something?
Oh.
Mwah.
Thank you, but I meant
your divorce papers.
Oh.
As much as I have enjoyed
sleeping next to them
for the past three weeks,
maybe they could make their way
over to Lynette sometime soon?
It's just been
so hectic at work.
I haven't had a second to call
the process server.
No, but anybody
can deliver them, right?
I mean, what about
your assistant?
I don't think that
that's appropriate.
Well, I could...
have a messenger?
Jane, honey, it'll get done.
I'm just really busy right now.
Okay.
I love you, and I look forward
to spending many more birthdays
together.
You are the best,
and now I really am late.
I will see you tonight.
Bob just called.
I gotta run.
Whoa. Whoa. Hang on.
What about the box?
Huh? The what?
The box...
that's in your hands?
Oh, the box. I...
Actually couldn't open it.
You were up there
for 20 minutes.
I feel asleep.
Man, you have a comfortable bed.
Talk to you later.
Oh, my God.
Is it that bad?
Listen to me.
Mike is not defined by what is
or isn't inside this box.
Okay. I have a right to know.
I'm his wife.
I know. I'm just trying
to protect both of you guys.
Lee...
Susan, please,
trust me on this.
Hi!
Welcome to Cumberly's
personal shopping service.
Can I help you with something?
I see we have
very... similar taste.
I always work with Margaret.
Is she here?
Oh, you don't want Margaret.
Her idea of fashion is wearing one
normal shoe and one clunky shoe.
She has a prosthetic leg.
And that's why she's my hero.
Lazaro! What gives?
You said I'd be kicking ass
at this job.
It takes time to build
a client base, Gaby.
Stick with it, okay?
Five, six months from now,
you'll be our top seller.
Six months? I don't have
that kind of time.
I need money quick.
I'm sorry. Most of the ladies who come
in here already have a personal shopper.
Oh.
You know, you could try
the men's department.
You would be very persuasive
over there.
Huh.
Well, I've always been able
to get men to buy things for me.
How hard could it be to get
them to buy things from me?
Mm-hmm. Just wear something
sexy, show a little cleavage,
and maybe lose
the wedding ring.
Seriously?
Oh, yes.
Guys tend to spend more
when they think they have a shot
with the hot salesgirl.
Lazaro...
I know. It's demeaning and degrading.
I shouldn't have even...
No, no, no, no. I just need to know,
show I lose the jacket?
'Cause these things are
a lot more persuasive
when they're out.
Mm-hmm.
I don't care
what the D.A. says.
There's no case.
My guy's innocent.
Please stop calling it a body.
It's a foot, an ear,
and a flap of skin.
Do these have raisins?
'Cause that grosses me out.
No.
No. Okay. Look, I gotta go.
Um, my 11:00's here.
Yeah. Okay.
Sorry I'm late.
Uh, not a problem, Mr. Weston.
Mmm.
Call me trip.
This is amazing.
Well, I don't like to brag,
but I am famous
for my orange-glazed muffins.
Yeah. Uh, Bob said that
you were one hell of a Baker,
but he didn't tell me much
about your case.
Well, the whole thing is
quite ridiculous.
The police found a dead man
at a construction site,
and they think
that I killed him.
Yeah. Everyone's guilty
until proven innocent.
They must have something
on you.
Well, they did receive
a letter from my ex-husband
saying I did it.
Well, that's nothing.
The guy's got a vendetta
against you, right?
Yes, he does.
Uh, and then there's
a slightly more damning
phone conversation
in which I expressed remorse
for, um, putting a body
in the ground.
Big deal.
You were talking about
burying a dead pet.
I suppose I was.
And then...
The police claim to have found
one of my fingerprints
on the dead man's shirt.
Hmm.
That's bad, right?
Actually...
I think that it's Noble...
Noble that you donate so much
of your clothing to Goodwill...
And a shame that that poor sap
ended up with your shirt.
Bob was wrong.
You're not good.
You're amazing.
So you'll take my case?
Nope.
"Nope"?
No offense, but, um,
it's kind of a snooze.
Excuse me, but I have been
accused of murder.
My life is on the line here.
Oh, please. What jury is
gonna convict you,
with your... your pearls
and your perfect hair
and your subtle scent
of lavender?
Well, I would think
that a lawyer
would enjoy defending
an innocent client.
You would think so,
wouldn't you?
But I love a challenge.
Last year, I defended a guy
who was found standing
over his dead father
with a bloody knife in his hand.
Not only did I exonerate
his guilty ass,
I got him 50% of the estate.
That is reprehensible.
Thank you.
I'm sorry, Ms. Van de Kamp,
but this is just...
it's too easy.
I mean, people who are famous
for their muffins...
not generally killers.
Good morning.
My name's Gabrielle.
I'm a personal shopper here.
Can I help you?
No, no, no. I'm just trying
to find the men's department.
I need some socks.
Oh, I can help you with that.
May I?
Oh, you're right.
These ankles deserve...
So much better.
You think?
I-I've always thought
they were just average ankles.
Average? They're exquisite.
Ooh!
Do you work out?
I do
a little mall walking, yes.
Well, I don't say this
to every man,
but you've got the perfect
ankles for cashmere.
Let me show you a few pairs.
40 bucks for socks?
I know. There's just something
irresistible about cashmere.
Promise me you won't buy
one of these cashmere sweaters.
I wouldn't be able
to keep my hands off you.
Well...
I really just need the tie.
How can you take the tie
without the blazer?
With your shoulders?
And this color up against
that beautiful silver hair...
I'm sorry. I lost myself there
for a moment.
Ooh! Hello, George Clooney!
It's just so expensive.
I don't know.
You know what?
Maybe I should measure
that inseam one more time.
What if it was drugs?
Seriously?
I just fell asleep.
Oh. This baby's been working
on her black belt.
I'm just saying,
Mike had a drug problem.
Those things never go away.
I'm sure it was
nothing like that.
You're right.
It's probably porn.
And you know what?
I'm cool with that.
As long
as it was nothing weird.
Oh, God. You think
it was something weird?
Stop.
Just trust Lee.
If he thinks you shouldn't
see in the box,
well, you don't want
to find something
that would tarnish
your memories of Mike.
You're absolutely right.
I should just leave this alone.
Susan, it's...
2:00 in the morning. I know.
But I can't sleep,
and I am never gonna sleep until
I know what's inside that box.
So you can either let me in now
or we can do this again at 3:00
and then at 4:00
and then at... thank you.
So there's his passport,
letters from his mom,
a really cute picture
of you and M.J.
Just get to it.
And a checkbook.
Apparently, he set up an account
eight years ago.
That's when we were divorced.
And every month since,
he's written a check
to some woman named
Jennie Hernandez.
I've never heard of her.
This is her address.
Somewhere in mount pleasant.
Oh, my God.
Any chance those are M.J.'s?
No.
Well, maybe it's...
We both know what it is.
There's a child out there.
Mike's child.
77, 78, 79, 80.
Hi, Lynette.
81, 82, 83...
What are you doing?
84, 85. Making Tom a cake.
86, 87...
Gosh, how old is he gonna be?
46? 47? 48?
92, 93, 94, 95...
I made dinner reservations
at 7:15.
Or was it 7:16? 7:17?
Nice try, but I am like
rain man. 98, 99, 100.
Sorry to bother you.
Penny and Parker left this stuff
over at our place,
so I thought I'd drop it by.
Thanks. I see
they're making lab coats
a lot tighter
than they used to.
I see they're making sweatpants
just as baggy as always.
Besides, I'm not going to work.
I'm taking Tom
to his favorite restaurant,
because, you know,
it's his birthday.
Yeah, I know.
That's why I'm making him
his favorite cake.
Looks appetizing.
Don't forget to add
the eye of newt.
Oh, 'cause it's green?
It's a funny story.
When Tom and I were
first dating,
he wanted a red velvet cake
for his birthday,
but I only had
green food coloring,
and he liked it anyway,
so it's become a tradition,
one we have shared
for 25 years.
I think we're
gonna keep sharing it.
Lynette,
stop embarrassing yourself.
Tom is through with you.
We have a family together.
You don't just throw that away.
Until you do.
Mm-hmm. What is that?
Your divorce papers.
Tom already signed them.
Now it's your turn.
What the hell?!
Oh, my God!
You look beautiful.
Oh. You're just saying that
'cause it's obvious.
Mwah.
I'll be home for dinner.
Oh, by the way, think you
could mix things up?
Getting a little tired
of chicken.
You forgot something.
Oh. That.
Here's the thing...
It's better for business
if I don't wear it.
Really?
I have a lot of rich men
as clients.
If I flirt with them,
they buy more stuff,
which means I make more money,
and you can cook something
other than chicken for dinner.
You know what?
I'm not comfortable
with you dressing like that
and flirting with those guys.
Oh, honey, you have nothing
to worry about.
They're just a bunch of nerds
with money.
This just helps.
You can't dress for church
if you want to move the merch.
Gaby...
You gotta shake your rear
to get them to buy the gear.
Gaby...
You wanna sell some
knits, you better flash your...
Gaby! I got it.
Too bad.
I have, like, 15 more.
See you tonight.
Lynette?
What are you doing here?
Look, Jane's meeting me
for my birthday.
Uh, Jane's running late.
She had a little trouble
with your cake.
You signed this?
How did you get these?
They were handed to me
personally by your new roommate.
Answer the question.
I did not ask Jane to bring
these to you, I swear.
It doesn't matter
if Jane brought them.
He's gonna need
a few more minutes.
Look, I'm... I'm... I'm... I'm taken
a-a little off guard here.
Can we talk about this later?
This is your signature,
isn't it?
Yes.
When did you sign it?
I don't know.
A while ago, I guess. I...
You guess? Jeez.
This isn't a gym membership.
This is for the dissolution
of our marriage.
Look, I know.
You think I don't know?
This is hard for me, too, okay?
But you gotta believe me.
There is no way I meant for Jane
to bring this to you.
Then just tell me,
what is it you do mean?
Do you want
to end our marriage?
Sorry.
Sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm s...
Please talk to me.
You know, it's just that you've
had so much going on lately,
I-I-I, you know, I thought...
I thought it would be helpful
if I took the papers over
for you.
On what planet is
you serving my wife
divorce papers a good idea?
I thought I was
doing you a favor.
Me a favor?
Really? Me?!
Fine. Us!
I just want us to move forward.
I can't stand this "one foot in,
one foot out" thing
that you've got going
with your ex.
It's not what I signed up for.
I told you
I would take care of it.
Now is not the time.
It's never the time, Tom,
until you make it the time.
You don't just th-throw papers
at someone
and say, "Here. Sign this.
Everything that we have known
and worked for is over."
It's not that easy.
It is when you know
what you want.
Tom...
I love you.
But if we're gonna be together,
you've got to stop
thinking about her needs
and start thinking about mine.
I am always gonna care
about Lynette.
She's the mother
of my children.
So you need to decide
whether you can live with that.
It's gonna be okay.
Hi. I'm looking for Jennie.
I'm Jennie. And you are?
Susan Delfino, Mike's wife.
Oh.
Yeah.
I'm so sorry for your loss.
Thank you for your sympathy,
but what I really need from you
is an explanation.
Why was Mike sending you
checks every month?
They weren't for me.
They're for Laura.
Okay.
Who's Laura? Mike's daughter?
No. His sister.
So... this is a group home?
For autistic adults.
Laura's one
of our more severe cases.
She can't speak.
Loves painting though.
Spends hours every day
at that table.
Did Mike ever mention
having a sister?
No. Never.
He was great with her.
He came by every Monday night
to visit.
Told me he had softball.
Excuse me a moment.
This is crazy.
No. This is good.
There's no other woman, no kid.
Why wouldn't Mike tell me
he had a sister?
I don't know.
Did he think I'd be upset
about the money?
Because I wouldn't.
I'm sure he knew that.
But why did he think he had
to hide this from me?
I mean, did he think
I was the kind of person
that wouldn't accept her?
Sorry about that.
Would you like to meet Laura?
We'd love to.
His name is, uh, Ramon Sanchez.
He would've stayed here
around, uh, six months ago.
Mm-hmm.
Hmm. Doesn't ring a bell.
But he could be
in my treasure chest.
I keep all the items
guests leave behind.
My husband calls it hoarding.
But I fancy myself
more of a collector.
20 bucks says we're barking up
the wrong crazy here.
If the prosecutor
needs more connection
to that Van de Kamp broad.
Trust me. I'll find it.
Must be your lucky day.
Room 208. Ramon Sanchez.
Thank you.
Magazine with a map,
some receipts.
I don't think
there's anything here.
He circled Wisteria Lane.
So what? It doesn't connect him
to her. Not directly.
It does if he was going
to her address.
Bob should be here any minute.
You really don't need
your lawyer.
I just wanted to show you
something that we found.
What is it?
It was with some
of Mr. Sanchez's things.
As you can see,
he wrote your address on it.
But that doesn't make any sense.
Why would he...
Look, if this goes too much farther,
there's nothing I can do to help you.
But if you come forward now,
tell me everything
that happened,
things will go a lot easier
for you.
I think I should wait
for my lawyer.
Is there someplace I
could get some water?
Right outside.
Mr. Conklin's parole hearing
is tomorrow at... 10:00.
Do you really want me
telling the board
that you couldn't find
the documents
that I requested a week ago?
I-I'll check again,
Mr. Weston.
Don't check. Find.
Ms. Van de Kamp.
You okay?
I think so.
Just, uh, waiting for Bob.
They found some other evidence,
and I'm just not sure
what to make of it all.
Look, uh,
I'm trying
to help you out here.
But there is a clock
on this deal,
so I'm not sure how much longer
you wanna wait for your lawyer.
You must hate
being a detective, huh?
Mr. Weston.
Even a rookie cop knows
that interrogating a suspect
without counsel present is
a violation of their rights,
so this must be your way of
trying to lose your gold shield,
and you know what?
I think it's gonna work.
We're just making small talk,
waiting for her lawyer.
Well, small talk's over.
I'm her lawyer.
Let's go.
You don't need his permission.
You wanna talk to her,
you talk to me first.
Is that clear,
soon-to-be-a-patrolman Murphy?
Good evening, detective.
I thought my case was
too boring for you.
It was, but I realized something
that made it interesting.
You may not have done this,
but you sure as hell know
who did.
Thank you. Ooh. Wine list.
I'll take that.
And be sure to bring me
the check.
Tonight's my treat.
Whoa. Kinda pricey.
I thought we were supposed to be
saving for Bree's lawyer.
We are, but I'm starting
to do really well,
so I think we can afford
one splurge.
I don't know.
Oh, come on, Carlos.
I want to do this for you.
Can't you just enjoy it?
I guess I can do that.
Gaby?
Jason!
Hey! I thought that was you.
Wow!
Hi!
Oh!
Whoa!
Who are you?
Oh, this is Jason,
one of my clients.
Jason, this is Carlos, my...
brother.
Oh, hey, man.
Nice to meet you.
Grab a chair. Join us.
Thanks.
So, uh,
your sister here is
quite the little saleswoman.
You believe she talked me
into a $4,000 suit today?
I mean...
that is so... sis.
Carlos, maybe you should go to
the bar and get us some drinks.
Nah. I'm not thirsty.
So, uh, I'm wearing one
of the shirts you picked out.
What do you think?
Oh. I can't tell you what
I think in front of my brother.
You're so funny.
Hey, Carlos, how is it possible
that someone as awesome
as your sister
hasn't been scooped up already?
My guess is it's the herpes.
Sibling humor.
You're right. All those trips
to the free clinic
could've been for anything.
Seriously, Carlos,
some drinks for the table
would be really good.
You know, what the hell?
I'll take
a scotch on the rocks.
Uh, a single malt.
Actually, you're gonna have to
get that one yourself.
I am going home to my wife.
I'm married.
I can't believe
you just did that.
That guy's
one of my best customers.
Oh, are we talking about
that "nerd" you sell to?
Okay, maybe he's a little
better-looking than the others,
but it's my job, Carlos.
Fine. Whatever.
Let's just get out of here.
You are such a hypocrite.
How many times did you tell me
to show a little cleavage
when meeting
your out-of-town clients?
My breasts were practically
a tourist stop.
This is different,
and I don't like it,.
Well, too bad.
We need this job.
I'm the breadwinner now.
Yep. Throw that
in my face again.
What?
"Make me dinner, Carlos."
"Get me drinks."
"Bring me the check."
Yeah, Carlos,
I did offer to treat.
And you know what I was
thinking? How good it felt,
how for the first time
in 19 years
I was able to treat you,
and I can't believe
that would bother you.
Well, it does.
It's driving me crazy
that you're the one
making all the money
and calling all the shots.
Well, get used to it,
because I did all this for you.
This is what you wanted.
Uh, give 'em to her.
She's driving now.
You're up early.
I'm up late.
Once, in college,
I wrote Mike a letter
about how horrible you are.
And good morning to me.
We'd just had a fight
on the phone,
and I needed to put my anger
somewhere.
Anyway, when you said
that Mike had some old letters
in that box,
I wanted to make sure
mine wasn't in it,
so I checked...
and I found these.
They're from Mike's mom adele.
It turns out you weren't
the only one
who was in the dark
about Mike's sister.
He didn't even know she existed
until eight years ago.
What? Why?
It was clear early on
that Laura was going to have
special needs.
I guess Mike's parents
weren't up for it.
"So, yes, Michael,
I am ashamed of myself,
"and I live with that decision
every day.
"But life with your father
was always hard,
"and keeping Laura would have
been an inconvenience
that might have destroyed
everything."
This was the last letter
she wrote Mike.
"And so now you know
the worst secret of my life,
"but I beg of you,
let it remain a secret.
"Your beautiful new family
"is one of the only joys
I have.
"Don't let them know the kind
of person I really am."
Mike wasn't keeping a secret
from you.
He was keeping a secret
for her.
Well, I know what Mike
would've wanted me to do.
I am gonna keep writing
those checks,
and I'm gonna keep Laura
in my life.
My God.
Adele had to live with that
on her conscience.
Yeah.
How do you do
something like that?
How do you give away
your own child
just because it's inconvenient?
Oh, no, no, no. No,
um, I-I didn't mean...
it's... it's not like that
with you.
No, mom, it is.
All the stuff I've said
about being pregnant...
That I'm not ready,
or that I'm not sure
I'd be a good mom...
It's all bull.
What this baby really is to me
is inconvenient.
I've been thinking about this
all night.
I don't want to make a decision
that I'm going to be ashamed of
for the rest of my life.
I can't live with that.
I won't.
Julie, are you saying...
Yeah.
I'm gonna keep her.
Yes, in life,
we all make plans,
but sometimes they don't
turn out the way we expected.
By trying to help out,
we may damage a relationship.
By attempting to reach out,
we may push someone
further away.
By digging into the past,
we may enrich our present.
But then there are those
who refuse to let go
of their plans,
no matter how badly
they're turning out.
Hey.
Can I buy you a beer?
I figure you could use one.
Why?
Trip Weston's taking
the Van de Kamp case.
The guy won't quit
till he gets what he wants.
Yeah, neither will I.
So how about
you buy me that beer
when the bitch goes to jail?
Previously on...
Lynette fought to save her marriage.
I could see it in his eyes.
Tom still loves me.
Carlos decided to change careers.
Maybe counseling.
In one week, a counselor does more good
than I've done in my entire life.
Good news...
We're getting married.
Oh!
Came with bad news.
In the middle of his proposal,
the cops come by to ask
about some dead body
they found at the construction site.
So tell me more.
I told 'em that I didn't
know anything about it,
and the police don't seem like
they're gonna pose a problem.
But it became a problem for Bree...
We're just making small
talk waiting for her lawyer.
Small talk's over.
So she got the perfect lawyer.
Let's go. You don't need his permission.
You wanna talk to her,
you talk to me first.
When it came to her divorce,
Lynette Scavo was determined
to make things go smoothly.
So when Tom was late to pick up the kids,
she waited patiently.
When he got something in the mail,
she held on to it.
And when he left behind
something important,
she brought it to him.
Yes, after years of fighting
had led her nowhere,
Lynette decided to take the high road.
Lynette?
Oh! Hey, Gregg.
Hey. Coming by to see
the new offices?
I bet I could get the C.E.O.
to give you a private tour.
Wait a second. I am the
C.E.O. I know I could.
No, thanks.
I'm just dropping something
off that Tom forgot at home.
Oh, wow.
My ex wouldn't bring anything
by for me unless it was ticking.
Oh.
So... how's everything
going with your separation?
I'm guessing you know the answer
to that, having been there.
Yeah, it's been two years since
my divorce, and it still sucks.
Ah.
You know, it might not
be my place to say it,
but I think Tom's nuts for letting you go.
That's very sweet.
So are you seeing anyone?
That's... a little nosey.
Sorry. I-I'm just saying,
if you ever wanted
to have a drink and vent
with somebody who gets it,
I would gladly be that person.
Okay.
Sweet again, but I think
that might be a little weird
with you being Tom's boss.
Yeah, I get that.
I just wouldn't forgive
myself if I didn't ask.
But never worry
if you're gonna be okay, Lynette.
You will. You are the exact kind of woman
that most men out there are looking for.
Well, thanks. I-I always
liked this picture of us.
You're welcome.
Oh, hey, I'm off on Friday,
so we can leave early for the cabin.
Uh, bad news. Uh,
I checked the weather up there.
It looks like rain for this weekend.
So? I wasn't seeing us spending
a lot of time outdoors.
I think we have a little...
"Horizontal" to catch up on.
It's kind of been a while, hasn't it?
Well, I guess, with, uh,
work and everything.
A cabin, the rain...
a bed.
It's gonna be a good weekend.
Yes, Lynette had tried hard
to take the high road in her divorce...
Hey, Gregg.
That drink... I'd actually enjoy that.
But sometimes, the low
road was easier to find.
Carlos Solis was used to
sitting in a position of power,
whether it was behind
the wheel of a powerful car...
at the head of a power lunch...
or at the helm of a powerful company.
But now that Carlos Solis
had started a new career,
he suddenly found himself
in a much humbler place.
So... what do you think of my new office?
Okay, I'll admit it's a little
bit on the bare bones side...
Are you kidding?
All you need is some yellow tape
and a noose hanging from the ceiling,
and you'll be ready to entertain.
I like it, daddy.
Thank you, baby.
Aw, that's so sweet.
You're lying to spare
your daddy's feelings.
Seriously, honey, there's a guy
down at the department store
who dresses all the windows.
Maybe he could spruce it up.
"Spruce it up"?
Gaby, we can barely
keep the lights on here.
Our budget is tiny,
and every cent goes towards
helping addicts,
finding them jobs, housing...
Okay, okay. Save it for the pamphlet.
All I'm saying is, if I was an addict,
rooms like this are why
I shoot up in the first place.
Okay, behave. Listen to your daddy.
I'll see you tonight.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
I can't take the girls to school.
You always take them.
I have to go to work early today.
Well, I'm at work right now.
Carlos, how much do you make in an hour?
$12.
I just made $12 listening
to you tell me you make $12.
Gaby, come on. This job
is very important to me.
I'm doing very meaningful work.
You should be proud of that.
Well, when we can pay
our mortgage in "Meaningful,"
I will be.
Mwah.
Hey, buddy. How was school?
Okay. I'm starving.
Can I have some cookies?
Sure.
Didn't you like the turkey
sandwich I made you?
Not really.
I tried to trade it to John Gurry
for a book about worms,
but he backed out 'cause
you used too much mayo.
Sorry. Didn't realize
the worm kid was such a gourmet.
What's this?
Nothing.
Wait. Your school's
having a soapbox derby.
Yeah.
Well, that sounds like so much fun.
It's for dads and sons.
Yes... but it doesn't say
moms can't do it, too.
That's okay. I don't have to do it.
Besides, it's in three days.
Oh. That's really soon.
I guess we should get started.
Oh, come on.
I don't want you to
miss out on all the fun.
Mom, you can't make a car.
What makes you say that?
'Cause you can't even
make a turkey sandwich.
Well, thank goodness I have
the most talented partner.
Now come on. We're wasting time.
Let's get hammering.
Seriously? You're telling me
you're against the death penalty?
I've just seen too many cases
where the wrong person gets convicted.
Not my clients, of course.
Well, I just think
our society's gotten too soft.
We need a powerful deterrent
to stop these killers.
You do realize you're not on trial
for a parking ticket, right?
Kidding. Hey, I'm just...
just trying to lighten the mood.
Tomorrow's gonna be fine.
It's just a pre-trial hearing.
Yes, which brings me one step
closer to the real thing.
So what exactly... will we
be doing at this hearing?
You will sit there and
look classy and innocent.
I will try to get as much of
their case tossed as I can.
And your success rate at
this sort of thing is?
Impressive.
I once defended a woman who ran a brothel.
At the pre-trial,
I got the whole thing reduced
to operating a business
without a fire door.
That's terrible.
What? What, me being a great lawyer?
No, defending a prostitute.
Call me old-fashioned,
but I find that line of
work rather distasteful.
So-so if she ran a cigarette company,
or manufactured handguns, she's a-ok,
but-but selling men a little ring-a-ding
makes her a pariah.
Okay, first of all, "Ring-a-ding"?
Second, sex, isn't a commodity.
It's... sacred.
Yeah, I'll say, and for this woman,
sacred cost 400 bucks a pop.
Can we please stop talking
about it? It's tawdry.
And that little crack about
manufacturing handguns?
I hope that doesn't mean you're anti-gun.
I've sued the N.R.A. three times.
It is my dream to one day take
those sons of bitches down.
Well, when it comes to my guns,
you're gonna have to pry them
out of my cold, dead hands.
"Guns"? Plural?
Mm-hmm.
What, is that so you can, uh,
coordinate your firearms
with your shoes?
You and I are never gonna
agree on anything, are we?
This salad kind of sucks.
I agree.
Not with the language,
but with the observation.
I have never met anyone
who can pull off a cape
like you, Mrs. Duncan.
And this is our last one,
so I'm not letting you
leave here without it.
Uh-oh. Another stray from
the land of elastic waistbands.
Avert your eyes. I'll get rid of her.
Hello, dear.
You must have taken a wrong turn.
Sensible shoes are one floor down.
Oh, actually, I'm looking
for a personal shopper.
I need help.
Okay. Um...
you're welcome.
Oh, champagne. Oh...
Oh, no, no. This is just
for high-end customers.
And me. My husband's an alcoholic.
So I can only drink at work.
I'm looking to freshen up my wardrobe.
I haven't bought new clothes
in quite some time.
I understand. Fixed income?
No. My rich husband was
a stingy son of a bitch,
and now he's toes up. I am ready to spend.
Who was your husband?
William Hammond.
As in the Hammond theater?
Mm-hmm.
And the Hammond hospital?
Yep.
And the Hammond library?
So you've heard of him.
Are you kidding?
I've been to shows in that theater,
I've given birth in that hospital,
and I went into that library
once for directions.
Oh. Well, sit down
while I pull you some clothes.
Oh. There you go.
Well, thank you.
Oh, honey. Look at that cape.
That looks interesting.
Give me that. You look like batman.
There you go.
And for the reception,
I was thinking of a jazz band.
Wouldn't that be cool?
Eh, I like jazz.
Uh, but if you're interested
in a little, uh,
traditional australian music,
I know this guy who plays
a badass didgeridoo.
Jazz it is.
Okay, we've done enough.
Let me clean this up,
and then we can go upstairs
for a preview of our wedding night.
Oh, now you're talking.
I'll grab some wine.
I know this might surprise you,
but I actually have a few moves saved up
for my first night as Mrs. Ben Faulkner.
Uh... it's not that I don't believe it.
I just... can't imagine... what's left.
Oh, yeah, that's just some,
uh, some business stuff
that I need to take.
No, it's a subpoena.
You're on the witness list
for Bree's trial? Why?
Uh, beats me. I-I th-think
they made a mistake.
Kind of a coincidence, though.
Well... the cops questioning you
about that body they found on site
and then Bree getting
arrested for killing the guy?
Ben, don't lie to me.
I can handle anything you tell me,
just as long as it's the truth.
Um... okay.
Listen, Renee, let's just drop this, okay?
No. I'm about to become your wife.
You wanna keep a secret
about touching another boy's
didgeridoo at summer camp, fine.
But not about a murder.
Holy crap.
I'm right.
Tell me what's going on,
or I'm walking out of this house.
You're gonna need to
let me think about it.
I don't believe this.
My, uh, my first husband
kept secrets from me,
and it ended our marriage.
I'm not going down this road again.
Gaby, why is there an old lady
sitting at our dining room table?
Do you have any idea who that is?
I think my generic reference
to her as "Old lady"
kinda says I don't.
She's Doris Hammond,
as in Hammond investments.
Ring any bells?
Bill Hammond's widow?
Guy made a killing in private equity.
Why is she here?
She's my best customer down at Cumberly's,
I think mostly 'cause
she sees me as her friend.
Oh. So you thought you'd exploit that...
invite a lonely widow to dinner,
pretend she's your friend,
just to make money off of her.
Exactly.
Gaby, can't I just take my plate upstairs?
I'm exhausted.
You're exhausted?
I had to watch a 20 minute iPhone video
of her cat taking a nap
in a laundry basket
just to sell her a coat.
Now get out there, lose your top button,
and look pretty.
Doris, I can't get over how
lovely that jacket looks on you.
Isn't it lovely, Carlos?
Yeah, it's great.
Oh, I almost had a heart
attack when I saw the price.
I guess I just have to get comfortable
with the idea of spending money.
That's right, and tomorrow when
the new fall line comes in,
we're gonna get you real comfortable.
So, Carlos...
what is it you do?
I... work for a nonprofit
that helps recovering addicts.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Was Carlos talking about his charity?
Good thing we weren't
operating heavy machinery,
huh, Doris?
You'll have to excuse my wife.
Not the biggest fan of what I do.
Oh, that's silly.
Philanthropy is very important.
My Bill gave generously
to many worthy causes.
Okay, if we're gonna keep
talking about charity,
I'll make coffee. We're gonna need it.
Boy, Bill left quite a legacy.
Have you ever thought
about carrying that on?
Oh, I'd love to, but
I wouldn't know where to begin.
Maybe I could help.
So my ex's lawyer says,
"We believe it's fair"
"for Mr. Limon to pay
an additional $1 million."
And I said... and this is how my mouth
always gets me in trouble...
"So that comes out to what,"
"about $1 a pound"?
Oh, man. And the judge...
Not amused, which is why I wound up paying
an additional $2 million.
Ohh. Tom and I are going to try
to do this without lawyers.
Huh.
What does that mean, "Huh"?
We've known each other 25 years.
We have kids together.
And that's great.
It's all great, but there
is another person involved.
Jane.
And trust me, she is gonna
be in his ear the whole time
about the settlement.
By the way, I do not get
the attraction there.
Well, let's save that
topic for another night.
We can do hours on that one.
Another night?
So this is going pretty good.
Yeah. It's been great.
Well, okay, we should do it again.
How about Saturday night?
This Saturday's bad.
Tom needs me to switch weekends
because he's going away with... Jane.
Well... it'd be kind of a shame
if some last-minute stuff came up at work,
and he wasn't able to go.
Yeah.
I guess that would mean
he wouldn't have to switch weekends,
and that would free you up for Saturday.
Did I get that calculus right?
Are you saying in order
to get a date with me,
you'd mess with Tom?
Don't think of it so
much as messing with Tom.
Think of it more as messing with...
Jane.
Jane.
Oh, my God. It's staying together.
How long is this race?
Three minutes.
Three minutes!
This can totally stay
together for three minutes.
Can I go now?
I was gonna have you help
me put on the wheels.
No, thanks. Juanita found a dead squirrel,
so I kinda wanna check it out.
Well, of course.
Gotta see the dead squirrel.
Only touch it with a stick!
No fingers!
Blown off for a dead squirrel?
Boy, does that bring back memories.
New hobby?
Oh, M.J. and I are building
this soapbox thingy car
for the school's big race.
You should get Tom to help.
He did it with all our boys.
It's how they learned to swear.
Oh. That's okay. I'll figure it out.
I am telling you, he loves this stuff.
I'm gonna give him a call.
Oh, thanks, but I really think
it's better if I do it myself.
But Tom can just...
Tom is not... gonna be
around all the time.
I'm sorry. I mean, you know what I mean.
I do. Since Tom and I split,
I know how hard it is
to be both Mom and Dad,
but I also know it's okay to ask for help.
No. I can do this. I have to.
And you know what?
I think it's gonna turn out great.
Do you always move
your lips when you read?
Do you always comment on everything
that bugs you about me?
I haven't said a word about your tie.
Okay, we're here for discovery
compliance, and trial setting.
Ms. Stone, Mr. Weston,
you've exchanged witness lists?
The people have no objection
to Mr. Weston's list.
Mr. Weston, any objections?
That depends.
Who are the gentlemen
from number 16 to 28?
I've never heard these names before.
Your client has.
They're men she met at a bar,
brought home, and had sex with.
This is ridiculous.
Your Honor, the defense
will argue that there's
no suggestion of a relationship
between Ms. Van De Kamp and Mr. Sanchez,
that she never even met him.
Because she hadn't.
Some of these men will testify
that she was so intoxicated
during their time together,
that she didn't remember
anything about the liaison.
Suggesting that she could
have slept with Mr. Sanchez.
So under Ms. Stone's
"forgetful slut" theory,
you can connect my client
to any man in Fairview.
Well, not every man in Fairview ended up
with the defendant's
fingerprint on his shirt,
But Mr. Sanchez did.
Your Honor, the idea that my client
would conduct herself in...
in that manner is absurd.
She is a paragon of
virtue in the community,
a champion of conservative values...
Short recess, Your Honor?
Bree...
Bree, is this true?
Did you sleep with Ramon Sanchez?
No.
But the other men?
How the hell could you not tell me this?
Oh, all right, okay. This...
this is okay as long as
we can stay in front of it.
Um... I need to know exactly
who you slept with and when...
Are you kidding me? No.
Bree, if I'm going to defend you,
I need to know the truth.
I'm sorry, but I can't
talk about this with you.
Gaby?
Doris, you won't believe
what just got off the plane.
The most beautifully
embroidered chinese silk,
and if you listen to it carefully,
you can hear little children asking,
"When's dinner?"
Oh, I'm gonna have to
stop you right there.
Okay, a little insensitive. My bad.
No, I-I've had a change of heart,
and I can't buy anything more from you.
In fact, I need to return these.
What? You can't. I work on commission.
I-I mean, you love these clothes.
Did you know that one of these scarves
could buy a month of vocational training
for a homeless addict?
No, but that sounds awfully familiar.
It was in the pamphlet that
Carlos slipped me last night.
He did what now?
And we talked on the phone this morning,
and he reminded me of what
my husband used to say...
that "Those who do well
must also do good."
That sounds like Carlos.
He's a very special guy.
Hold on to him.
Well, now that you mention it,
I can't wait to get my hands on him.
Do you have any idea how much commission
I stood to make from this lady?
Gaby.
Doris was my golden goose.
I was fattening her up,
and then you went and stole all her eggs,
and-and, well, I don't know
where this metaphor is going,
but I am mad at you, mister.
Gaby.
No, stop "Gaby"-ing me.
I will not be "Gaby"-ed.
Look, where Doris puts
her money is her decision.
Tomorrow morning, 9:00,
she's putting it here.
Okay. You don't have to be so smug
just 'cause you're "doing charity".
No quotation marks.
I'm actually doing charity,
helping people get their lives together.
And I'm helping people put
their wardrobes together.
Potato, potahto.
I got to run to a meeting.
Now? We're in the middle of an argument.
Yeah, but it's no fun to
argue when only one side
is morally defensible.
But you know what it is fun?
A little victory dance.
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
Okay, it took me all night,
and I scraped off two of my knuckles,
and I drank so much green tea
that one of my eyes won't stop twitching,
but... it's... finished.
Okay. Before you say anything,
I designed the flame decals myself,
so if you don't like them,
they're totally removable.
but personally, I like them.
I think they're awesome.
And there's a basket on the
back for sundries or snacks
or thumb tacks to throw under
the competition's tires.
But why would you need to cheat
with a car like this, right?
Are you gonna say something?
Oh, I get it.
You hate the basket. Guess what.
Basket gone.
Oh, come on. I've been doing
this for two days straight.
You gotta give me something.
I... love it.
You do?
Hee hee! I mean, of course you do.
But seriously, if you have any
thoughts or tweaks, tell me.
'Cause we still have
a day before the race.
No, no, it's perfect.
Oh, I'm so relieved.
You wanna take it for a spin?
Yeah, but... I'm kind of thirsty.
Can you get me something to drink?
Of course. Two frosty
non-caffeinated root beers
coming right up.
Oh, my god! What did you do?
I didn't see it coming. I'm so sorry.
No, not you! My son! You can go.
M.J., did you wreck the car on purpose?
No. It just rolled down the driveway.
It's a flat driveway.
Okay, I did it.
Why?
I hate that car.
Well, then we'll change it.
We'll make it whatever you want to.
I don't wanna do it.
I don't wanna be the weirdo.
Honey, did someone call you a weirdo?
They don't have to.
They're always staring at me
and treating me different
'cause I don't have a dad.
Oh, honey.
And if I go to the Father-Son Derby,
and I'm the only kid with his mom,
it's gonna be even worse.
I'm so sorry. I had no idea.
What can I do to make it better?
Nothing. I just want dad.
Hey!
Hey! How was soccer?
Awesome. I think we're gonna
kick San Marino's ass on Saturday.
Nice. You want me to make
you something to eat?
Thanks. I'm gonna get changed.
Hey.
Hey.
It's cute how her generation
thinks that sport is interesting.
Oh, and, um, I will bring
her to the game Saturday.
Looks like we won't
need to switch weekends.
I thought you and Jane were going away.
Can't. I got to work.
Gregg wants me to rework
the strategic plan
the international guys did, so...
Huh. Well, that sucks.
Never liked that guy.
Then why'd you go out with him?
I mean, he said you guys
had drinks the other night?
It was nothing. We just, you know...
hung out for a bit.
You do realize that that
could be awkward for me.
Huh. That's weird.
What?
I have an "Isn't That Ironic" app
that usually buzzes when
people say stuff like that.
I'm serious, Lynette. That's where I work.
It was just drinks with a guy I know,
who happens to be your boss.
I promise not to do anything embarrassing
like... kissing in the office.
Okay. You know what? You wanna see Gregg?
It's fine with me.
How about if instead of
eating this sandwich,
I just wanted to eat chocolate?
Hey. How about... "No"?
But what if I told you
something about dad and Jane
that would make you very happy?
Then could I?
Why, you little finagler.
How do I know your
information is even worth
the fine Belgian chocolates that
I have hidden in the pantry?
Oh, it is.
Oh. It would be wrong to teach you
that this kind of blackmail works.
Besides, I can see
you're just bursting to tell me anyway.
When dad told Jane he had
to work this weekend,
she kind of lost it.
Really? The chocolate that
I am in no way trading
for this information has almonds in it.
She was all, "We never have time together"
and "You still haven't
filed the divorce papers."
Is that true? He hasn't?
The envelope is still sitting
on a shelf in the kitchen.
Put the sandwich down,
or you won't have any
room left for chocolate.
Well, look who strolled
in from the outback.
Where the hell have you been?
Sorry. I really needed to
sort through some stuff.
Stuff? You mean what hors d'oeuvres
we'll be serving at the wedding,
or are you referring to the dead body?
Hey, if you plan on staying,
you'd better start talking.
I am impossibly in love with you, Renee.
And there's nothing I want
more than to come clean.
But if I tell you what's going on,
you could get dragged into this,
and then you're at risk, too.
You have to trust me.
Your ex kept secrets to hurt you.
I'm keeping them to protect you.
Okay.
Really? That was easy.
Well, while you were on your walkabout,
I remembered something.
Spousal privilege.
Which is?
It's a crazy law we have here.
You don't have to testify
against your husband.
So here's what's gonna happen.
We say "I do," we walk back up the aisle,
the second we're outside that church,
you tell me everything.
And if I don't?
Well, then I guess you won't be seeing
those wedding night
moves I told you about.
And trust me...
my secret is way better than yours.
Ahh, so you are alive.
You're just not answering your phone.
I'm sorry. I just...
can't imagine what you must think of me
after hearing all that.
Bree, listen, I don't judge people.
I defend them.
And if I'm gonna defend you,
I need to know everything.
Sexual history from your first husband
down to the last guy on
the D.A.'s witness list.
How about I go in the kitchen and say it,
and you just... listen from out here?
No dice. I need you to say it to my face.
Why?
Because you're gonna be sitting
at the defendant's table
while one guy after
another takes the stand
and goes into as much graphic detail
as the prosecutor wants him to,
and the whole time the jury is
gonna be looking at your face.
Oh, dear god.
And if the look on your face is guilt,
they're gonna think you're guilty.
So I need you to own
this part of your life,
and that starts with
you telling me everything.
Okay.
I hoped it wouldn't come to this, but, uh,
maybe it would be helpful if I told you
my sexual secrets first.
No, it most certainly
would not be helpful.
Besides, men aren't embarrassed
about their conquests.
I am gonna start talking now.
First time I had sex...
I was 24.
I was in law school.
She was a classmate and
rather experienced.
It didn't go very well,
or for that matter, last very long.
Yeah, yeah, it's hilarious.
In fact, every Christmas,
I get a card from her
that says, "Still laughing."
So you had an awkward first experience.
Who didn't?
You want worse? I-I can do worse.
Okay.
I don't know how to say this. Um...
I am... quite oversized down there.
Since when is a man being well endowed
considered humiliating?
I'm talking about my prostate...
my enlarged prostate.
Best part... your doctor tells you
it only happens to older men.
That's the reason you have
to pee 30 times a day.
So now you know I'm pushing 50,
borderline incontinent,
and women are scared of my junk.
Is that humiliating enough for you?
Yes, I think it is.
Glad to hear it.
I have to tell you now, don't I?
I was in a dark place...
lonely...
and in pain, I started...
drinking... again.
So the kicker to the story is,
the new international plan
that Tom came up with is...
is pretty awesome.
He may not have good taste in women,
but he is damn smart about finance.
Tom is really smart...
in that one area.
Poor Jane.
You're really enjoying this, aren't you?
A little, tiny bit.
You should.
I wish I had a way of getting back
at Crystal when we were breaking up.
Must feel good.
Jane was pretty pissed, huh?
Oh, apparently.
So even though that makes
me a terrible person,
thank you for that.
Anytime. I mean that.
Anytime.
So...
if I asked you to have Tom
work a few nights this week,
you'd do it?
If I could help you piss off your ex
and spend more time with you,
I see no downside in that.
You just say the word.
Really?
Late nights, weekends.
Maybe even a few out-of-town trips?
You tell me what you want,
I'll make it happen.
I like the sound of that.
Must be why women fall for powerful men.
And then the prosecutor suggested
I was probably so drunk,
that I forgot the whole thing.
Well, hang on. Didn't your hotshot lawyer
get all up in her face
with the "Objections"
and the "Sidebars"
and the "You can't handle the truth!"?
Trip was amazing,
but she still said it was admissible.
My entire sordid past is admissible.
So just because you slept with a few guys
means you slept with Alejandro?
More than a few.
Sorry. Carry on.
You know what the worst thing was?
The look on Trip's face.
He was so disappointed in me.
Wait. That was the worst thing?
Worse than the whole
sharing-a-cell-for-20-years-
with-a-big-gal-named-Vern thing?
Well, I'm not going to prison.
I mean, Trip says we're gonna win,
and I believe in him.
I just thank god that
even after all of this,
he still believes in me.
Okay, I'm gonna say it.
Bree, you have a crush on your lawyer.
Don't be ridiculous.
You do sound a teensy bit smitten.
I am not smitten. I-I happen to
admire his legal skills, and...
His dreamy blue eyes?
They're not blue. They're green,
flecked with hints of brown.
Okay, maybe I find him attractive,
but do you really think
I would put myself at risk
by dating my own attorney?
Oh, I don't know.
You put us all at risk
when you dated Chuck.
Look, having a crush is
nothing to be ashamed of.
He's rescuing you, and it's in our D.N.A.
to fall for guys who rescue us.
But in this case, it's just
not safe for you to act on it.
I guess you're right.
You're on trial for murder, Bree.
You got to keep a clear head.
And so does he.
Doris, I just want you
to know how grateful we are.
Your donation is gonna help
so many recovering addicts
get back on their feet.
Oh, stop. I should be thanking you
for letting me be a part of all this.
And please forgive
the appearance of my office.
Every penny that we get goes
directly to those in need,
so there's not a lot left over for...
nice... things.
Those in need, huh?
This is not my stuff!
I had a simple wooden desk,
an old coffee table.
Oh.
And a baby grand.
Well, that must come in handy
while you're all singing "Kumbaya"
during your clean needle exchange.
Doris, please.
This is not what we're about here.
Find yourself another old lady to fleece.
Honey, I need to show you
something in the garage.
Did you fix the car?
No. Juanita used the wood to
build a coffin for the squirrel,
but I do have a little surprise for you.
Oh, hey, perfect timing, M.J.
we could really use another pair of hands.
What are they doing here?
Well, I know I told you
that I could do this myself,
but I got to thinking
that every race car driver
has a pit crew, and this is yours.
We're here to help you.
And not just about car stuff, you know?
Anytime you need something,
give us a call.
So what do you think of this design?
Hey?
It... kind of looks like a Corvette.
Kind of? It's an exact rendering.
Look at the shading on the wheel well.
Calm down. You traced
it out of a magazine.
Can you guys really build this?
Um, well... not without your help.
So what do you think about color?
Red or blue?
Mom? What do you think?
I think, uh... this is
kind of a guy thing,
and I should let you guys get to work.
My dad loved Corvettes.
We know.
He always said if he ever won the lottery,
first thing he'd do is buy a
Corvette stingray convertible.
Come on in.
Whoa. You look like a million bucks.
Aw.
And trust me, I know what
a million bucks looks like.
What a lovely compliment...
for one of us.
So, uh, Gallo is
the best restaurant in town,
and after tonight, you will know why.
Well, can't wait.
Let's go.
But first... I have a gift for you.
A nail.
How thoughtful...
and... imaginary.
A nail in the coffin of Tom's happiness.
The end of Tom and Jane.
Completely baffled.
Every time this week
I told him I needed him late,
Tom would go in his office,
and I'd hear him on the phone
in a big fight with Jane.
You shouldn't be telling me this.
But... yay!
So how do you think
the persnickety Ms. Carlson
will handle the news of Tom's transfer?
His what?
The international plan needs a point man,
so I'm sending Tom to Mumbai for a year.
M-Mumbai like... India Mumbai?
Which means you and I will have Fairview
all to ourselves.
We got to go.
Lynette?
Car.
Huh?
I can't believe you did that to my office.
I had a butler lined up,
but he booked a commercial
at the last minute.
So I guess I'll call Doris
now and make an appointment
for shopping tomorrow.
Yeah, I don't think she'll be
answering either of our calls.
She thinks we're both nuts,
so thanks a lot, Gaby.
You started it. You're
the one who stole her from me
in the first place.
Yeah, for something that matters.
Oh, enough with
the Carlos of Nazareth act.
This wasn't about helping people.
This was about you smelling money
and going after it.
The money was for the center.
Those people need it.
The center? Please.
You were doing it to win.
And you know why?
'Cause you're a shark, Carlos.
You always have been,
and you always will be.
It's your nature.
Honey.
It's okay. I am, too.
That's why we're good together.
Look, I may not like that
you stole Doris from me,
but I do like that you're
the type of guy who can.
It's sexy.
But...
that's not who I want to be anymore.
Well, who do you want to be?
Somebody different.
Well, I hate to tell you this, babe,
but the best you can hope to be
is just a different kind of shark.
Yes, it isn't easy giving up power...
admitting that we might need help
from friends and neighbors...
Deciding that a loved one...
might know what's best for us.
Giving up our better judgment
for a slightly darker agenda.
But for some,
the hardest kind of power to give up...
is the power to control their own desires.
Hello. You wanted to see me?
Did you, uh, have some
new thoughts on the case?
Lots, but why don't
we discuss them over dinner?
Dinner. Um, can't we talk here?
No, I've been cooped up all day,
and I know this great,
little Italian place.
I don't think that's a good idea.
Oh, come on. I'm a much better lawyer
after a plate of spaghetti carbonara.
So? What do you say?
I say...
let's do it.

Previously on...
Lynette found that dating Tom's boss...
If I asked you to have Tom
work a few nights this week,
you'd do it?
You just say the word.
Had its advantages.
I'm sending Tom to Mumbai for a year.
Julie made a big decision about her baby...
I'm gonna keep her.
And the baby's father made a commitment.
I'll get a job.
I'll take... I'll take classes.
I'll do whatever it takes.
Carlos and Gaby argued...
Carlos.
I am not gonna let Bree
take the fall for a crime I committed.
After Bree was arrested for murder.
This is one of those times where
the best things you can do
is do nothing.
But Bree's attorney was confident...
Did you, uh, have some
new thoughts on the case?
Why don't we discuss them over dinner?
As well as convincing.
Since Bree Van de Kamp was arrested,
she had experienced
a wide range of emotions.
One moment, she felt afraid.
The next, she was angry.
And through it all, she felt ashamed.
But now that her trial was approaching,
she was beginning to feel...
a little rattled.
Bree, are you okay?
Yeah. Just all this witness preparation
is making me nervous.
Gaby's been in there for ages.
Trip's very thorough.
He just wants to make
sure we're all ready.
There you are. That took a while.
No kidding.
I haven't been grilled like that
since Carlos got my last credit card bill.
Well, as alibi witnesses,
you're gonna be asked about
every detail of the night
that Ramon disappeared.
And we can't afford any slip-ups.
So... how many dinner guests
were there that night?
14.
What color dress was Bree wearing?
Red.
What sauce did she serve with the chicken?
Oh. I got this.
Barbecue?
Gaby, of all the things
I've been accused of,
the idea that I would serve barbecue sauce
at a dinner party!
Oh, you're right. I'm sorry.
That sounds way worse than
saying you killed Alejandro.
Wait. Uh... Who's Alejandro?
Uh, my gardener.
I'm always getting...
my mexicans confused...
which I'm allowed to do,
because I'm mexican.
I gotta run. You, uh,
you gonna be all right?
Of course. With you in my corner,
how can I not be?
Okay. What was that
little prom photo moment
with the hands?
We warned you about this.
You're still going after him, aren't you?
Of course not. I am totally
focused on the case,
and so is he.
Okay, fine. What am I supposed to do?
He is the most intelligent,
caring, charming man
I have met in ages.
And by the way, it isn't
exactly a one-way street.
He's been showing quite a bit
of interesting in me, too.
Um, Bree...
And besides, if I reject him,
he might be too humiliated
to do a good job on my case.
Yeah?
Something tells me he's gonna bounce back.
Yes, after Bree Van de Kamp was arrested,
she felt a range of emotions.
But the one thing she
didn't expect to feel...
was jealousy.
At the Fairview childbirth center,
there are certain conversations
you expect to hear...
discussions about the magic
of a changing body...
Look at me. I'm a cow.
The beauty of natural childbirth.
Just so you know, I'm getting the drugs.
Or the importance of healthy nutrition.
Take a chip, lose a hand.
But Julie Meyer found herself
having a conversation...
I can't believe Bree's
on trial for murder.
I mean, come on.
Killers don't wear aprons.
That was rather unexpected.
I know. It sucks.
You know what else sucks?
Somebody trying to relax you
by talking about a murder.
You're right. I'm sorry.
So what would be a good
thing for you to visualize
that might help relax you?
Me punching Porter in
the face for being late.
Okay. Forget visualization.
How about we try
some of that breathing stuff again?
Ugh. No. I hate that "Hee-hee-hee."
Feels stupid.
I know. But it works.
Relaxes you when you start
to get stressed out.
Okay, nice job, everyone.
We're gonna show the birthing DVD now.
Julie, sorry, sorry, sorry.
I had to clean out
the fryer before I could leave.
No worries. Plus you
smell like french fries.
I love french fries.
It's because you're about to go through...
You missed, like, the whole class.
She did great. Let me tell you,
this girl can visualize.
I planned on getting out early,
but a shift opened up,
and I had to take it.
What do you want me to say?
I want you to say that you'll be on time
for one thing we do as
we get ready to have this baby.
"Hee-hee-hee-hee."
It's not funny, Mrs. Delfino.
Look. I said I'm sorry.
The point is, I'm here now,
and I'm 100% focused and ready to help.
Just stay calm.
The crowning begins,
and the head of the baby becomes visible.
Hello. This is Bree Van de Kamp.
May I please speak with Trip?
Oh. Was he having lunch alone?
Oh, right. The blonde woman
with the convertible.
I see. Right.
Thank you.
Okay, I know there's been a lot of talk
about what you should wear to the trial,
so I've selected a few outfits
that just scream "Acquittal."
What do you think?
Black and white stripes?
Oh, good point. Don't need to
put an idea in the jury's mind.
How about ruffles? I read somewhere
that no one has ever been
convicted while wearing ruffles.
Well...
Okay. You're right.
There's always a first time.
To hell with ruffles.
How about this one?
It's lovely, but I am
being accused of sleeping
with a total stranger and killing him.
And red is the color of
blood and whores. Got it.
Don't worry. We'll find something else.
Bree, something wrong?
Apart from me standing trial
for murder in three days, no.
Life is good.
Relax. It's gonna be okay.
And remember, you're actually innocent.
Juries can sense things like that.
I hope you're right.
Of course I am.
And Trip's a brilliant lawyer.
He's gonna get you off in no time.
I'm just worried that he's been
a little distracted lately.
He seems fine to me.
I have some other dresses in the back.
Let me bring 'em out for you.
It's gonna turn out fine, Bree.
Honestly, I'm not worried at all.
India?
Not India. He said he's going to Mumbai.
That's in India, you idiot.
How long are you gonna be gone?
A year.
What? Dad, you're gonna miss
my eighth grade graduation.
It won't be so bad.
We can send him pictures.
We can skype.
So he's supposed to teach me
to drive over the computer?
And he's gonna miss the birth of my baby.
I am sorry, guys.
Look, I talked to my boss.
He's not changing his mind.
There's nothing I can do.
Besides, it's... it's just for a year.
It'll go by like that.
Daddy, no!
I don't want you to go.
I know. I love you so much, baby.
Guys, could I have
a minute alone with your dad?
Yeah, sure.
Guys, it's gonna be okay.
We're gonna get through this!
I don't know how we're
gonna get through this.
So how did Jane take the news?
Um, timing could've been better.
We're not exactly in
a good place right now.
Well, maybe some time
apart will do you good.
Hmm. Maybe.
It's gonna be...
really weird being so far away.
I know. It's gonna be so hard on the kids.
Actually, I was talking about you.
I don't think we've ever been apart
for more than a month.
Who's gonna tell me what to do?
What to think?
Whether your shoes are on the right feet.
Exactly.
I'm really gonna miss you.
I'm...
so sorry.
Why?
There's nothing you can do about it.
Hello.
Are you looking for Trip?
Yes. Well, he's meeting
with the judge on my case.
I'll wait for him.
So how exactly do you know Trip?
He... hires me from time to time.
And what is the nature of your work?
I really can't say.
Discretion's an important part of my job.
Oh. I see. Well, part of your discretion
is falling out of your blouse.
Excuse me? Look, this is
Mr. Weston's place of business.
Maybe you should meet him
in your place of business...
perhaps a seedy motel
room or a street corner.
Are you calling me a hooker?
Well, if the push-up bra fits,
or in your case, doesn't...
That's it. Screw you, lady.
Tell Trip I'm off his case.
Lindsay. Lindsay.
Trip?
What the hell?
Uh, she wanted me to tell
you that she's off the case.
What was she doing on the case?
She's a private investigator
who was working on
a really big lead for us.
Wh-why did she quit?
No idea.
I'd better go talk to her.
No! I mean, you know how careful
you have to be with some women.
They can misinterpret the littlest things.
I'll talk to her.
So what do you think, maid of honor?
Nice.
You do realize you're gonna
have to wear this... in public?
You got a problem with it?
No. It's just... the purple
is such a... bold choice.
Aren't you afraid it's gonna
pull focus from the bride?
And the sky and the earth?
Lee, look at my wedding dress.
All of this wearing all of that...
Santa Claus in a thong riding a unicorn
would not be able to pull focus from me.
Lynette, you okay? You seem a little...
distracted.
I think she's still in shock.
No, it's just...
this whole thing with Tom.
Oh, Lynette, it's gonna be fine.
My dad traveled all the time.
My siblings and I adjusted.
Yeah, but he said he was gonna miss me.
Really? Suddenly I'm interested.
That's great.
And it was the way he said it,
too, like...
he'd been kind of missing me already.
Well, what are you gonna do?
I don't know.
There's no way I can let him
get on that plane to Mumbai.
Or eat these
if you're going to fit in that dress.
Lindsay! Hi.
I think we got off on
the wrong foot earlier.
Keep walking.
I suppose I deserve that,
but if I could just have a...
I'm on surveillance! Stay down.
Ooh, how exciting.
What are we surveilling?
well, nothing now.
I've been waiting six weeks
for that cheating bastard
to leave his curtains open.
I'm sorry.
Trip told me where to find you,
because I wanted to apologize
for my unkind words.
You were merely doing your job,
and I was very rude.
Well, you were more than rude.
Yes, I was also off-color.
I never should have...
implied you're a hooker
or insulted your bosoms.
They're lovely.
No.
Not that. You like him.
You thought I was sleeping with him,
and you got jealous.
I'm not jealous of you and Trip.
Is there a "You and Trip"?
Oh, god, no. He's, like, 100.
Look, I'll come back to your case,
and I'll give you a free
pass on the crazy jealousy.
It's not all your fault.
What do you mean?
Trip's a good lawyer.
He listens carefully.
He tells you he'll protect you.
Female clients are always
getting the wrong idea.
Well, that might be
the way it normally goes,
but I happen to believe
there really is something
between Trip and me.
Sorry, but I know him.
He's all about the job.
He's into your case, not you.
Porter is going to be fine. Trust me.
Oh, sure. He'll just wear a helmet
so he doesn't crack his head open
when his head hits
the delivery room floor.
Baby, I'm telling you,
when the man gets in there with you,
it just clicks.
They see the blood and stuff,
and it starts to seem
like a video game to them.
I'm getting a bad feeling about this.
Okay, you know what?
Mike almost passed out
when he saw that video.
And he was a little shaky
in the delivery room, too.
But once M.J. was born,
he was my rock.
M.J. took his first step right there.
We were so excited.
Then he took his second step right there.
Fell right on his face.
He was... bleeding and...
I was a mess.
And Mike knew exactly what to do.
He always did.
Oh, mom.
I'm okay.
Just so many memories of him here.
Anyway...
the point is...
you shouldn't worry about Porter.
I just...
I think that he's not into this anymore.
That he's losing interest in being a dad.
He was late for class because of work.
You gotta cut him some slack.
It's not just that.
He's missed some doctor's appointments,
and he missed the tour of
the birthing room at the hospital.
We had a deal.
He was supposed to help raise
the baby so that I could finish school.
But now I'm afraid that
it's all falling apart.
That was delicious.
I'm glad you liked it.
More wine?
Lynette, it's our third date.
I'm pretty much a sure thing.
Something wrong?
You're acting a little weird.
Yeah, there's...
I have a little favor to ask you.
Please, don't send Tom to Mumbai.
You have a very odd sense of foreplay.
I know. It's just...
the kids are upset, and Tom is a wreck,
and I don't think I can
go through with it.
Okay.
Really?
Yeah. I didn't want him to go.
I was just doing it for you.
I'll send McGuinness instead.
That son of a bitch had the nerve
to beat me in tennis last week.
Oh. Thank you.
I am so grateful.
Well...
I can think of one way
that you can show your gratitude.
Mm.
Whoa.
Um, maybe you're the one who
needs another glass of wine.
Gregg. No.
Okay, what's going on?
I just... I'm not ready for that step,
and I don't know that I ever will be.
Ever?
I'm sorry. There's... someone else.
You just realized that?
No. No, I just realized how
much I want it to work.
So let me get this straight.
You use me to get back at your ex,
and now you're dumping
me for some other guy?
That's unbelievable!
Unbelievable.
And in local news,
the trial of Bree Van de Kamp
is set to begin tomorrow.
Van de kamp is accused
of killing Ramon Sanchez,
whose body was discovered
beneath a condominium
development in Chapman woods.
Hey. Couldn't sleep?
Hey. No.
Huh.
Thought I'd take a walk.
Remember the last time
we were up this late together?
The night we buried Alejandro.
God, if we could only go back.
Hey.
You having trouble sleeping, too?
No, I woke up to get some water,
and I saw you from the window.
What are you guys doing up?
We can't sleep because our friend
is going on trial tomorrow
morning for murder.
Oh, relax. Bree's innocent.
The jury's gonna see that.
Juries make mistakes.
Well, you know, it doesn't help Bree
for us to be negative right now.
Do you know what I was thinking
we should do to help her?
Go to the judge and tell her the truth.
I was thinking the exact same thing.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a minute.
What's going on here?
What, it never even crossed your mind?
Well, we have a plan in place,
and if we just hold on a little longer,
everything will be back to normal.
And what if Bree is convicted, huh?
What are we gonna do then?
I don't know.
Clearly. Do you even care?
Lynette!
Okay. It's late.
Well, let's just talk about it tomorrow.
Well, I don't get this.
Why are you guys mad at me?
Because you're not having
any trouble sleeping.
Don't freak out. It's just me.
Trip, what are you doing here?
It's the middle of the night.
I had a feeling you might be up.
Do we need to discuss my case?
Nope. Just the opposite.
Doughnuts... "Casablanca."
That's one of my favorite movies.
Yours, too?
Never seen it.
I'm, uh, more a "Caddyshack" kind of guy.
But I had a feeling about you.
May I?
Sure.
My trial starts in six hours.
Is this really what we should be doing?
Do you know anything about sports?
No more than I have to.
This is just like going
to the championships.
You practice your ass off to get there,
but the night before the big game,
you just forget about it.
I can't believe I'm going through this.
But if I have to...
I guess what I'm saying is,
of all the gin joints in all
the towns in all the world,
I'm glad you walked into mine.
Am I supposed to know what that means?
Start the movie.
Thank you.
In the matter of people vs.
Bree Van de Kamp,
we are here for opening statements.
Ms. Stone, you may proceed.
How well do we really know
our friends and neighbors?
They borrow our lawn mowers,
sit with us in P.T.A. meetings,
Bring us tuna casseroles.
But as this case will demonstrate,
they also have secrets...
Secrets they keep from their neighbors,
secrets that can poison
a place like Wisteria Lane.
Ms. Stone wonders how well
we know our neighbors.
Well, in this case, as it turns out,
pretty darn well.
Breen Van de Kamp's friends will tell you
that she is a woman of honesty,
integrity, and compassion.
Bree Van de Kamp is an alcoholic,
a woman of loose morals.
She would pick up strange men in bars,
have sex with them,
frequently waking up with
no recollection of what happened.
If picking up people in bars is a crime,
there might be a criminal or
two in this very courtroom.
The defendant lured Ramon
Sanchez into her house,
seduced him, and bludgeoned him.
There is no connection whatsoever
between my client and Mr. Sanchez.
And while it isn't against
the law to sleep with any man
who'd buy you a martini,
it is illegal to kill them.
Has Bree made some
questionable choices? Yes.
Does that make her a killer?
No.
It makes her human... like the rest of us.
This is a case about a woman
who led a secret life,
but here's the thing about secrets.
Like bodies, they don't
always stay buried.
Welcome to big top burger.
Hi. I'm looking for Porter Scavo.
Is he done yet?
No, Porter's working the drive-thru.
Oh. I thought he was
only working till 1:00.
Well, I heard him say
he'd cover the afternoon shift,
so that's till 6:00.
Now can I get you something to eat?
No, I think I'll get something to go.
Welcome to big top burger. Can I help you?
I've got a better idea.
How about you help
the mother of your child?
Mrs. Delfino?
Dear god. Is there another person
who could say what I just said to you?
No, of course not.
Porter, why are you making julie
do all of this stuff without you?
I'm busting my butt trying to
make money for her and the baby.
I'm working three jobs.
Well, then tell her that.
She's worried that
you're losing interest in being a dad.
I'm talking to the clown! Shut up!
Can you please pull up to the window?
Look, Mrs. Delfino,
I barely graduated high school,
I ditched college,
and this is about as much
as my baby's daddy is gonna achieve.
You can always go back to college.
When?
Everybody says how expensive
it is to have a kid.
With the crap money I make,
I'll be working all the time.
Look, I get it.
It's just not right for Julie
to do this without you.
I totally agree. Julie's given up so much
so I can be in this kid's life.
But I'm starting to realize...
that was a bad trade for her.
Look at her, a regular black widow.
It says here she slept with
15 guys in a 2-month period.
And she was drunk the whole time.
Sounds like college.
Excuse me. But you don't know
what you're talking about.
Do you even know this woman?
Actually, a friend of mine
used her to cater a party once.
Said she had shifty eyes.
They do look pretty shifty.
W-well, I do know her, and she's innocent.
Yeah, I don't think the police go around
arresting innocent people.
She must have done something.
Oh, so you guys read one article,
and just like that, she's guilty?
It's not just us.
Everyone says she killed the guy.
She's the last person in this
world who would kill somebody.
She's a friend and a mother
and probably the most
decent person I know.
And she would die if she knew
how people are talking about her.
Well, she better get used to it.
If I'm a juror, she's going
away for a long, long time.
And with every exhale,
the tension is being blown out,
and every inhale brings
in positive energy.
Now you're imagining
a peaceful scene...
that beautiful lawn by
the science building
at your college.
And you're walking
towards the chemistry lab
to finish the research
for your dissertation.
And now on that same lawn,
a graduation ceremony
in which you are finally
receiving your PhD.
Mom, what are you doing?
The other day, you were
talking about a murder trial,
and now you're talking about
stuff that will never happen.
I think it will.
How?
Because I am going to move
back up there with you
and help raise the baby.
What?
I'm gonna sell this house, and M.J. and I
are going with you so you
can finish your degree.
But... what about Porter?
Well, there will always be a place for him
in his child's life,
but Porter needs to find
his own life right now.
No. I can't let you do this.
You love the lane.
Oh, I do, but nowhere near
as much as I love you.
And besides...
I think it'll be good for me, too.
What do you mean?
Well, I told you, honey.
There are memories here
that are just too hard
to live with every day.
Mom...
this would be awesome.
But... are you sure you wanna do this?
I'm sure.
Okay. Lay back down.
As Mike used to say,
we gotta practice birthing a baby.
You are gonna love it there, McGuinness.
And hey, if you don't, it's only a year.
I'll give you my "India
on 50 rupees a day" book.
All right, people, let's get started.
Thanks again. I am so
glad to be staying here.
Yeah, well, thank your ex-wife.
She's the one who convinced me.
Really? Lynette did that?
Yeah. Real piece of work, that one.
I don't know how you put up with it.
I'm sorry. Um... aren't you guys dating?
No. She dumped me.
Apparently, she's hung
up on some other guy.
I'm surprised you didn't
wanna go to Mumbai
just to get away from her crap.
I know. She can be, uh,
a bit of a handful.
Oh, yeah, that's why you dumped her,
'cause she's a "Handful."
I'm telling you, guys,
23 years living with that psycho...
He's either a saint or a masochist.
Okay. Okay. Let's...
let's start the meeting.
Oh, seriously. I barely survived one week
with that ball-buster.
Gregg, I'm asking you, drop it.
I'm just saying Lynette
is a first class bitch.
Uhh! Oh.
Well, I hope that was worth it,
'cause you're fired.
Okay, Mr. Weston,
is the defense ready to
call its first witness?
We are, your honor.
The defense calls Susan Delfino.
How long have you known my client?
Nearly 20 years.
So it's fair to say you
know each other well?
We're like sisters.
She's the most honest
person I've ever met.
Can you tell us what happened
on the night in question?
It was a progressive dinner party.
I'm sorry. I don't get out much.
What is a progressive dinner party?
The whole street throws it.
Every house is responsible
for a specific course.
Oh, sounds like fun.
Unless you don't know how to cook.
They skipped my house that night.
Now as you traveled from house to house,
were you with Bree the whole time?
No.
Really?
Where did she go?
She left my house to
go check on her entree.
Wouldn't that have given her
time to kill Mr. Sanchez?
Or have sex with her boyfriend
while the chicken burned,
which is what she was doing
when the whole neighborhood
walked in on her.
I imagine that must have been awkward.
Clearly, you haven't spent
much time on my street.
And then what happened?
The party finished at my house,
and then Susan, Lynette,
and Bree stayed late
to help me clean up.
How late?
Around 2:00 in the morning.
And the coroner's report
said that the time of death
was between 10:00 P.M.
and midnight. Interesting.
So there's no possible way
that Bree could have killed
Ramon Sanchez that night?
No way. Bree couldn't hurt a fly.
The only thing she killed
that night was the chicken.
No. As god as my witness,
Bree did not kill him.
That's it from the car.
My assistant's gonna
pack up the rest of it.
Security's been told not to
let me back in the building.
I swear, Tom, I am
trying to be supportive,
but I'm having a hard time following this.
Why would you hit your boss?
I just... never liked him.
So? There's lots of people you don't like.
Mr. Indich in 3F,
who never picks up after his dog...
I can't even get you
to write an angry note.
You know what? I lost my temper.
Because he was going to transfer you?
No.
Because he was dating Lynette.
Oh, my god.
Are you still in love with her?
Jane, look, you have to understand.
Lynette has...
Been a part of your life
for 23 years. I know.
She's the mother of your children.
I get it. You've given me
this speech a hundred times.
Now answer the question.
Do you still love her?
Yes.
Wow.
And I was, what?
Some... wall you built to try
and hide that from yourself?
No.
You were the woman who was there for me
when I was broken and confused,
and I-I still care about you very much.
No.
Tom, you don't get to
break somebody's heart
and still say you care about them.
If it matters...
I loved you.
So you recognize this man as well?
Yes. I slept with him, too.
I can imagine how painful this is,
having to publicly acknowledge
liaisons with all these men.
No. You can't.
You didn't have to testify.
Why did you subject yourself to this?
Because I admit my transgressions.
Was killing Ramon Sanchez one of them?
No. Absolutely not.
That seemed very heartfelt.
So your conscience is clear?
Yes. It is.
Your honor, I'd like
to enter into evidence
prosecution exhibit 24.
Objection. We haven't seen this.
They can't blindside us...
This just came into
our possession last night.
It rebuts Ms. Van de kamp's testimony
regarding her clear conscience.
I'll allow it.
Does this letter look familiar?
Yes. I wrote it.
It's a suicide note, isn't it?
Yes.
This letter was discovered on
may 7th at the Frost Hotel,
where Ms. Van de kamp had taken a room.
The manager heard shouting,
including a reference to "A gun."
Police were summoned, but
Ms. Van de kamp was gone.
This was found in the wastebasket.
Proceed, Ms. Stone.
Do you recall anything
else of significance
occurring on may 7th?
No.
That's the day your boyfriend,
Chuck Vance,
a decorated Fairview police detective,
was killed in a hit and
run accident, wasn't it?
Objection. My client isn't on trial
for killing detective Vance.
Not yet.
Your honor...
Withdrawn.
Please. Read the letter.
"I never thought I could feel such...
remorse, such guilt."
Your honor, if we could
take a short recess...
Denied.
"No one knows who I really am."
"I'm entirely alone."
"Living with this secret is too painful."
"I can't go on."
Doesn't sound like a clear
conscience, does it,
Ms. Van de Kamp?
No further questions.
Bree.
Please, I just need to be alone.
Not until you tell me what that was about.
I already told you.
I was in a very dark place,
with the drinking
and my friends abandoning me.
But I did not kill anyone.
You have to believe me.
I do believe you.
I just... hope the jury does.
Come on. You don't know
that it's your fault.
Please, Tom loses his job
the day after I dump his boss?
There's gotta be some connection,
and the worst part is this is exactly
what broke us up in the first place...
me trying to control his life.
You really suck at this gay friend thing.
I'm sorry.
I can't take you seriously in that dress.
You look like a giant taffeta bruise.
I know. It is horrible.
Maybe if I accessorize.
Unless the accessories are
two hands over your eyes,
forget it. Why don't you just
tell Renee you hate the dress?
Because she'll pick another one,
and I'll hate that one, too.
It's what I do.
I did it to Tom all the time.
I didn't want him to go to school,
and then I didn't want him to quit.
I wanted him to get a new job,
and then I hated it. I don't know.
Maybe I wasn't unhappy with Tom.
Maybe I was just...
unhappy.
Well...
at least we know you were
right about that dress.
Now turn around, let me get you out of it.
Seriously? We're this close?
When I tell the whole
neighborhood about it,
I will be kind.
You're a good friend, Lee.
Celia, give me the remote!
No! Stop! Give it!
Girls, don't make me come in there!
It's my turn!
It's not!
Who did this?
Celia.
Is that true, Celia?
This belonged to my grandmother.
You are in big trouble, young lady.
Sweep up the rest, and go to your room.
It's not my fault. She pushed me into it.
You pushed her?
She wouldn't give me the remote,
and it was my turn to pick what we watch.
So you broke this.
It was my turn.
Juanita Solis, you were gonna
let your sister take the blame
for something you caused?
That is horrible!
This is your fault. Own up to it.
Don't you see how bad...
Mom? I'm sorry.
Mommy?
It's okay.
Go wash up for dinner.
I'll take care of this.
And the fracture found
on the victim's head
is consistent with a blunt force injury.
A blunt force that someone
of Ms. Van de kamp's size would
be capable of inflicting?
In my opinion.
Your honor, the defense
asks the court for a recess.
How did you find that?
When Gaby mentioned her
"Gardener," Alejandro,
my alarm bells went off.
I had Lindsay do a little investigating.
Oh.
"Oh"?
We're halfway through your murder trial,
and I find out the victim
is Gaby's stepfather,
and all you can say is "Oh"?
I'm sorry.
I wanted to tell you, but we made a pact.
Who did?
You and Gaby?
Me and Gaby and... other people...
people that I care about.
You care about them
enough to lie for them?
To commit perjury?
How about enough to go to jail?
You don't actually think
that's gonna happen, do you?
I don't know.
After the D.A.'s suicide note stunt,
it's possible.
To the jury, you look like
you're hiding something,
and the fact is, you are.
Look, I just... I just...
I wanna win this case
for you, okay?
And if this is something
that can exonerate you...
It can, but not without
betraying my friends.
Bree...
You're facing 20 years to life.
This could be your only way out.
I think it's time to tell
the truth about Gaby.
Yes, recent events in
the lives of my friends
had stirred up intense emotions...
excitement about starting a new chapter...
guilt over causing another's pain...
disappointment in a failure to change.
Then there are those who are asked
to put all emotion aside
in order to make a coldhearted decision.
Gaby, what are you doing here?
I finally found the perfect scarf.
It's... elegant.
It's dignified. It's beautiful.
It's you.
You are so sweet.
You didn't need to do this.
Yes, I did.
I haven't truly thanked
you for what you're doing,
the way you're sacrificing
yourself for me and my family.
You're just a much better person
than I could ever hope to be.
Oh, Gaby.
