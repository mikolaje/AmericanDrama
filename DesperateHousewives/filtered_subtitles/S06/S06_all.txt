Previously
on Desperate Housewives...
Carlos' niece arrived.
We want you to be part of this family,
but you will obey our rules.
Lynette and Tom got big news.
We're gonna have another baby.
Twins.
You'd actually send
your wife to prison?
My wife... no.
My ex-wife...
you bet.
Orson resorted to blackmail.
I think you're the most fascinating
woman that I have ever met.
And Karl made his move.
Katherine's marriage to Mike...
That woman... tell
her I had to go. It's an emergency.
... was put on hold.
You guys are in danger. Get out
of that car. Get away from Dave.
And when the dust settled,
wedding bells rang were ringing
for someone.
The veil was made
from the finest silk.
The garter was trimmed
with handmade lace.
The shoes were designed
by the top couturier in Milan.
You see,
the bride wanted only the best
for her wedding day
because she was about to marry
the best man in the world...
For the second time.
How do you feel?
Like the worst person in the world.
Don't do this to yourself.
Katherine is never gonna
forgive me for this.
This is your day.
You and Mike were meant
to be together.
Wish me luck.
Then by the power vested in me,
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.
You may kiss the bride.
Yes, the bride wanted
the best wedding money could buy.
But as she left the altar,
it suddenly occurred to her...
Sorry I'm late.
Did I miss anything?
She should've spent more
on security.

It's not hard
to find sin in the suburbs.
Just look behind closed doors.
That's where you'll find your neighbors
cheating on their taxes...
And drinking too much vodka...
And stealing
their father's magazines.
Yes, the suburbs are filled
with sinners,
some of who occasionally...
repent.
We can't do this.
It's adultery.
Luckily, we're both adults.
Stop! I'm married.
Yes, to a man
who's blackmailing you.
Making love to your lawyer wouldn't
be a nifty way to get back at him?
What now?
If I'm gonna break a commandment,
I don't want it to be for a quickie.
Who said quickie? I've got
40 minutes before my 10:00.
And thou shalt get sweaty.
I wanna do this. I do.
But not here.
I need to feel special.
But you are special.
Are you saying you've
never made love on this couch?
Not a special woman.
I get it.
I want this to be nice for you.
I'll find us a hotel.
Call me later when you've
set something up.
Done.
And just so we're clear,
this visit was not billable.
Morning. I'm late for school.
I don't have time for breakfast.
At least take a muffin.
Thank you, uncle Carlos.
Kind of warm for a sweatshirt,
isn't it?
It gets really cold
in the classroom.
Stop.
Lift it up.
Girls who spend an hour on makeup
do not wear baggy sweatshirts.
Lift it.
That oughta heat up the classroom.
Go and change.
What is your problem?
All the girls in my class
dress like this.
That's why your school nurse
is an obstetrician.
Wear something else.
Fine. I'll borrow one of your tops.
It might be exciting for it to go
someplace besides the supermarket.
Snap!
You I can hit.
Do you see
what I have to put up with?
It was just a shirt.
And when she came home past
curfew, it was just 40 minutes.
And when she took money
from my purse, it was just $5.
Why do you make excuses for her?
She's had a sad life.
Her mom's in jail.
Her dad walked out.
She's one dead dog
away from a country song.
I don't care.
Maybe she would calm down
if she felt a little more secure here.
I'm not signing those papers.
We need to be her legal guardians.
And look after her for two years?
Until I see a change in her behavior,
I'm keeping all my options open.
Is this better?
Yes. Very nice. Thank you.
Stop.
What do I smell?
Despair. Mortality.
Paralyzing fear.
I thought it was waffles.
Do you realize
that when these twins finish
high school, I'll be in my 60s?
No, you'll be in your...
At their graduation,
I will be the crazy old lady
with oatmeal on her chin.
I know this wasn't planned,
but we can do this.
We had a lot of fun
raising the first four kids.
But we were done.
We were across the finish line.
No more diapers.
No more strained carrots. No
more reading stupid "goodnight, moon"!
And with Preston going to Europe,
we even had one moving out!
We will never be done
if we birth two
every time one moves out!
That's just math!
Eight and half months to go.
Are you all right?
You know what's funny?
I was never able
to picture us old together,
sitting on the porch, gray hair.
I tried,
But I could never see it.
I'm sorry.
You don't have to...
Mike, please.
I don't need
another reminder of you.
So... How'd it go? How was she?
She was... okay.
What does that mean?
Did you tell her everything?
Did you tell her
we're getting married?
I think she's trying
to take the high road.
The high road? As in,
"I wish you and Susan the best"?
Or the high road as in,
"when I cut susan's brake line,
she'll careen off the high road"?
She knows it's over,
and she's dealing with it.
That must have been
really hard for you.
It was.
But now that she knows, it'll be
easier when you talk to her.
Me talk to her?
Why? Why?
You're the one who was
dating her, I just...
I don't...
I think we're good now.
You're gonna have
to deal with her at some point.
Fine. Yes.
I will. I will.
Just not today,
'cause Julie's coming home
and, you know,
I wanna get her settled in.
So... what about tomorrow?
That's not good either,
cause Julia and I are gonna
pick out my wedding dress.
You live right across the street from
her. You can't avoid her for 50 years.
Not 50.
Just till
she's too old to throw things.
Don't worry about it.
I think Katherine's
really gonna surprise you.
All of the windows are
triple pane energy efficient.
And the hardwood floors were
completely redone recently.
Black walnut.
It's nice.
Do you have any questions for me?
You pretty much got it covered.
Really?
Check me out!
I'm new at this. I just got
my broker's license last week.
Congratulations.
It's a pretty nice house
for your first listing.
I got really lucky. The woman
who handled the properties
in the neighborhood, she slammed
her car into a pole and got
and got fried by a power line.
Like I said, congrats.
Mrs. Bolen's been awfully quiet.
What do you think?
Me?
I'm thinking you're full of crap.
I'm sorry?
The fact that we can afford this place
says to me something is wrong with it.
So, start talkin'.
Mold? Termites? Leaky roof?
Honestly, I have told you
everything that I know.
Sure, you could play it like that.
But if we do buy this place
and it turns into a money pit,
I'm gonna need to
take my anger out on someone.
Like maybe the realtor
who made a big deal out of telling us
he lives right across the street?
I don't know that this
is actually considered a flaw,
but a while ago,
the lady who was living here,
she was apparently going
through kind of a tough time, and
long story short,
she committed suicide.
Shot herself...
In the head.
In this room.
That's it?
We'll take it.
Really? That is so...
I'll just get the paperwork.
It's a nice place.
I think we could be happy here.
Right, Danny?
Why are you asking me?
I didn't want to move here.
Honey.
Whose fault was that?
Look at you!
Angie, these are incredible.
What do you call 'em?
Pizzelles. Come on, eat up.
I made six dozen.
My grandmother's recipes
were for 30 people.
Trust me, she'd fatten
you four up in a week.
These go straight to your ass.
I'm sorry.
Do you guys not say "ass"?
Sure, we do.
Come on, Bree. Show her.
Susan tells me that your
son is about to start college.
We're just dealing with paperwork,
but he should be startin' next week.
I thought he was already in class.
He asked Julie to tutor him in math.
Really?
That must be Katherine.
I'll get it.
You didn't say Katherine was coming.
She's just dropping something off.
What's the matter? You've seen
her since this Mike thing.
Sorta.
Your voice just got very high.
You have talked to her, haven't you?
I'm...
going to. I've just been so busy
with all the wedding plans.
I wouldn't open with that.
I'm just dropping off the menu
for the Davenport anniversary party.
You finished that? Already?
It's three months away.
I have a lot of free time
on my hands these days.
How are you doing?
Haven't seen you in a while.
I've been...
using the back door a lot more
lately.
Your buttons...
I don't know
where my head is anymore.
Was it just me or was that
the most awkward moment ever?
You bet your sweet ass it was.
Hon, could you get me
a glass of water, please?
You got it.
Thanks.
It's our first.
Yeah, I got that.
How about you?
Four at home, two on the way.
Big family.
You're so blessed.
I just can't imagine anything
better than being a mommy.
Really?
I mean, I know it's a lot of work,
but luckily my husband
plans to be really hands-on.
That's not gonna happen.
Pardon?
He'll be there at first,
maybe even change a diaper or two
until the novelty wears off.
But those 4:00 a.m. feedin
he said he'd help out with?
Forget it.
You don't know my Johnny.
He's different.
Does he have boobs?
Then you're the only bar in town.
That baby can
scream into a bullhorn,
and Johnny won budge.
Thanks.
I'm not done.
You see this?
You'll never wear a bikini again.
But you've had four kids,
and you look good.
You haven't seen me naked.
My stomach looks like
spanish stucco.
And my breasts resemble two
balloons you'd find behind the couch
a week after the party.
Most women say this is the
greatest experience of their life.
Most women are liars.
My mother was liar,
and her mother was a liar,
and your mother is a liar. It's
a lie every generation tells the next
so they can get grandchildren.
Please stop talking to me.
You need to hear this.
You have to be prepared.
Your children will hit you
and steal from your purse.
Your husband will begin to buy
your birthday presents at the car wash.
And the kicker...
for the rest of your life,
there will be so many moments
when you feel lonely,
but you will never be alone.
They were out of water.
Is juice okay?
Hormones. Get used to it.
I cannot believe
we are finally going to do this.
You're not an easy woman
to pin down,
but I sure am going to enjoy trying.
What?
This is not what I was expecting.
I think I look pretty good
for my age.
Not you, Karl. The room.
It's filthy and hideous.
I took you to a nice hotel,
last week and we had to leave
cause you saw someone you knew.
Who we gonna run into here?
Certainly not a cleaning lady.
So it's a little dusty.
But trust me, once I get started,
you'll never even notice.
My God, those sheets!
What's wrong with them?
They're discolored, threadbare
and reek of industrial bleach.
Give me five minutes,
they'll reek of us.
I'm not gonna lie
on that revolting sheet,
wondering how many junkies
have died on it.
What do you want me to do about it?
Egyptian cotton!
These are pretty, aren't they?
Great. Love 'em. Let's go.
It doesn't help when you say
that about every single set.
An hour ago, I was half-naked.
Now I'm sheet shopping.
Forgive me if I'm an easy sell.
I'm just not sure this color
will match the carpet.
Get 'em in blue.
I'll tell you what they'll match then.
Fine. I'll take these.
Now we just need to stop
for some flowers.
Flowers?
I just want this affair to be nice.
You know, you don't want
this affair to be nice.
You don't want it at all.
Don't be silly.
Of course I do.
You may think you do,
but I've been chasing you
for two weeks,
and you've down nothing
but throw up roadblocks.
"Not tonight."
"Not this hotel."
"Not those sheets."
If you think I've been
leading you on, you're wrong.
It's not your fault.
It's just who you are.
A good girl who never breaks the rules
no matter how miserable it makes her.
I thought a little Karl time
might brighten your day.
But there's not much I can
do for someone who would rather be good
than happy.
Can I help you?
I've got a delivery for Susan Mayer,
but she's not home.
Do you mind signing for her?
That must be her gown.
Of course I'll take it.
We do things like this all the time.
In fact, just last month,
she took in something of mine.
Oh, God.
Katherine, it's me.
I've just come over to pick up my...
Hello, Susan.
I did not see that coming.
It's just so beautiful.
I couldn't resist.
Thank you for
taking such good care of it.
But I should probably go, so...
if you just wanna slip it off and...
Wait. I have to check on my sauce.
Sauce?
Doesn't that smell good?
It smells done.
Why don't you step away
from the pot?
No. The secret is
you have to keep stirring.
You know,
I really love this fabric.
It feels so expensive.
It is.
That's why they had it
all protected with that
acid-free tissue paper
and plastic garment bag.
Maybe...
I should give you some
of this sauce to take to Mike.
He used to love my sauce.
Of course,
he used to love me, too.
Okay, enough with the sauce.
I want my dress back, now.
Of course. I'm sorry.
Can you please unzip me?
It really is a beautiful dress.
Katherine was actually
wearing the dress?
Stop blocking my light.
Keep blotting.
Mom, relax. We got all the sauce.
No, I still see flecks of red.
It's your third wedding. An all-white
dress is gonna be a stretch anyway.
Do me a favor. Save the
"my mom's a slut" jokes for the toast.
You think I should
go talk to her again?
What? Why?
She's obviously hurting
more than I thought.
Excuse me, she kidnapped
my wedding dress
and held a pot of sauce to its head!
How could you possibly defend her?
I'm not defending her. I'm just
a little concerned. Aren't you?
No! I mean...
Yes, I was.
But at this point,
I'm a little sick of her.
Do you know that when I told
people that I'm getting married,
No one says congratulations.
They all say,
"Oh, my God. Is Katherine okay?
How's Katherine?"
Does no one remember
that you were with me first?
She stole my leftovers.
Does nobody remember that?
Did she just refer to me
as leftovers?
My point is that I didn't
do anything wrong.
You and I have a child,
and I am just tired
of feeling like the other woman.
Scary part is, of the two women
you could marry, that's the stable one.
Thanks for taking me to the store.
I promised Roy I'd make him meatloaf.
I think it's sweet that you found a male
companion at this stage in your life.
Roy's no companion.
The man has seen Paris.
That's right.
I'm back in the saddle.
It started one night when Roy asked
if my bathtub
was big enough for two...
You want me to crash the car?
Cause I will.
Hey, aunt gaby.
Need your car washed?
I'm aunt gaby now?
Let me guess.
You want something.
Well, there is a party
tomorrow night...
Really?!
Okay, you can go.
Seriously?
Well, if you can make an effort
around here,
then I guess I can, too.
Just be home by 10:00.
Yeah, that's the thing.
The party doesn't start till 11:00.
What kind of party starts at 11:00?
This new dance club is opening
downtown, and it is, like,
the hottest thing ever.
Everybody's going.
Not everybody.
It's a school night,
and you know the rules.
But thank you for washing the car.
Well, she's quite the charmer.
Do you see what I'm dealing with?
Carlos and I basically
took her off the street.
You'd think she'd be grateful.
But every day is a battle.
I don't know how to get through to her.
Teenage girls, they're the best
reason for not having kids.
Thank god Roy had a vasectomy.
So based on the data given
for this population,
and using the standard
deviation formula,
what do you think this variable is?
Would you like
to go to a movie sometime?
It's not like it would
be a date or anything.
We're friends, right?
Friends go to movies all the time.
I don't know if you know that.
Did you know that?
I did know that.
Really?
That's great.
Hey, Julie.
Nice to see you again.
Danny, do me a favor and take
the trash out, will ya?
Can I do it a little later?
Yeah, you could, but I think
you're gonna do it right now.
Thanks for doing that.
Doing what?
Not shooting him down.
I know he's probably not your type.
No, I like him.
He's nice.
Well, yeah, yeah, but...
Clearly not in your league.
I'm sorry you have
to work late, sweetie.
Don't worry about us.
Everything is fine here.
Good night, Ana.
Sorry.
Ana paid me $5.
Hey, muscles. I need a lift.
Hands! Hands! Hands!
Excuse me!
Sorry to interrupt. But can I
have your attention, please?
Hello?
Hi. My niece is somewhere
in this building.
She's got brown hair,
gold leggings, a cream top...
which she took from my closet.
So if you could just look around
and point her out...
This is important, okay?
She's only 16.
And she came here even though
she knew she wasn't supposed to.
Either you find my niece,
or I will call the cops
with their drug-sniffing dogs.
Found her over here!
Here she is!
Stop. Put me down.
Somebody... Get your hands off me.
Let me down.
God, what are you doing?
Thank you, everybody.
I told you not to mess with me.
I cannot keep doing this, Ana.
Or what?
You're gonna throw me out?
Fine.
You'd actually be doing me a favor.
I can take care of myself.
You're 16. How exactly
are you gonna make money?
I'm... I'm gonna be a model.
A model?
You know, people tell me
that I'm pretty enough.
I will just... I'll go to Paris
or New York, and I'll get discovered.
And I will be rich and famous,
and no one will ever
tell me what to do again.
And you really think it's
that easy to become a model?
It was for you.
What, you left home
when you were only 15.
I left because I had to.
My stepfather was...
not a nice man.
My mother didn't care about me.
My father left when I was 3,
and my mother's been in and out
of prison ever since.
I can beat you at this game.
This is not a game, Ana!
This is your life.
You can't scare me, all right?
And I don't stay where I'm not wanted.
Don't give me that.
We feed you.
We put a roof over your head.
And you're also keeping
all your options open.
I heard.
Good, you're back.
The girls haven't made a peep.
No more options.
I am now officially your guardian.
So... What?
I'm supposed to hug you now?
No, you're not gonna want to hug me,
because from here on out,
I am gonna be watching you
like a hawk.
I wanna know where you are
going, who you are going with,
And when you are coming home.
And I'm gonna keep you
from ruining that life
you are so anxious to start living.
You are so mean.
And I wish...
I wish...
someone had been this mean to me
when I was your age.
Look, it's complicated.
No, it's really simple, Julie.
You only care about yourself.
Please let me explain!
Go to hell.
Katherine said you were here.
And I thought,
since you were already in church,
we might see the pastor
and schedule some counseling sessions.
I don't need counseling, Orson.
I need a divorce.
Don't tell me
we don't need counseling.
You've been sleeping in the guest room
for weeks. It's not right.
I agree, and if you had
an ounce of chivalry,
you'd have given me the master.
You might think that withholding sex
will make me give up on us.
But I can be very patient.
You do realize in prison, I went
three whole years without any sex.
No, but thank you
for clearing up a question
I never quite knew how to ask.
Eight years ago,
we stood at an altar like this,
and we made a vow before god
to love each other.
Do you think I haven't
struggled with this?
I've struggled with this in ways
you can't even begin to imagine.
Then let me help you.
I can make you happy again.
How? By blackmailing me?
I'm not your wife anymore,
orson. I'm your captive.
Don't you feel any remorse
at all over that?
Of course I do,
Previously on...
It was a joyous occasion until...
Did I miss anything?
I'm asking you nicely to leave.
If youon't, I will drag you
out of this church myself.
I don't love these babies.
Lynette struggled with her pregnancy.
Stop saying that.
Gaby made a commitment...
I am now officially your guardian.
And Bree...
I'm married.
To a man who's blackmailing you.
Jumped in with both feet.
I think we could be happy here, right, Danny?
New neighbors...
Would you like to go to a movie sometime?
Moved in.
Look, Danny, please let me explain.
Go to hell.
What's gotten into that kid?
He's a teenager.
Go look for him.
And evil made an appearance on Wisteria Lane.
The first time Karen McCluskey saw Roy Bender,
she did something she didn't expect to do.
She smiled.
The next time they met, Roy did
something he didn't expect to do.
He smiled back.
After a week of sly flirtations, Karen and
Roy did something no one expected them to do.
And they did it twice.
With each passing day, Karen began to
feel something she hadn't felt in years,
and she realized she needed to know
if Roy was feeling the same way.
Has it been an hour yet?
14 minutes. Come on. Your doctor
said you need to walk an hour a day.
The little snot nose... I'd like
to drop dead just to piss him off.
Don't even joke about that.
I like having you around. I like it a lot.
You remember to put the seat down.
You can drive at night. A
girl could get used to that.
How many minutes has it been now?
I'm trying to tell you how I feel, Roy.
I didn't expect this. I always thought that...
You just get one big love in this
lifetime, and that was my husband Gilbert.
And after he died, I figured the rest of
my life was about making meatloaf for one.
Then you come along and... well... hell.
I love you, Roy.
Isn't there anything you wanna say to me?
You know how I feel.
A woman needs to hear the words.
All right. Here we go.
What the hell?
Oh, my God! Are you all right?
We gotta call 9-1-1!
For a moment, Mrs. Mccluskey didn't move.
And whether it was her boyfriend's discovery
of Julie Mayer or her realization that
he wasn't going to say the words
she desperately needed to hear,
Karen McCluskey suddenly felt the urge to...

It was a shame what happened that day,
considering how nicely the morning had begun.
One neighbor was out reading the sports
section, delighted to see that his team had won.
A child was playing with her new doll,
thrilled to discover just how durable it was.
And a woman was walking
with the man she adored,
determined to say she loved
him for the very first time.
Yes, up until the screaming started, people
thought it was going to be a wonderful day.
Oh, good. You're up.
Uh, yeah. Good mornin'.
Good morning.
Did you go to sleep with a
breath mint in your mouth?
This is our first morning waking
up as husband and wife again.
I wanted it to be perfect.
Well, it couldn't be more perfect.
Yes, it could.
Here's a breath mint for you.
Did we really get married last night?
Either that, or we paid a lot of
money to watch our friends get drunk.
Come here, mrs. Delfino.
All right.
We have a honeymoon to get started.
Hey, whatcha doin'?
Uh, nothing, sweetie.
Why don't you go play in
your room for ten minutes?
Ten?
I wanna play in here.
Okay. Of course you can.
In fact, I can't think of a better
way to start our new life together...
all of us here, Julie's home.
You know, the last couple years, when I used
to think about what I needed to be happy,
this was it.
This was the picture I had in my head.
Hey, Danny. It's Ana. Did you get my
message about going to the mall later?
Oh, okay. That's cool.
Um, how about tomorrow?
Yeah, me, too. The mall blows.
Well, give me a call if you wanna hang.
Shot you down, huh?
I could get Danny bolen anytime I want.
Okay. Well, let me know if you need any help.
Not that I need your help,
but... what do you got?
Here's the secret to landing
a guy... you have to ignore them.
You are the one who ends the conversation.
You are the one too busy to get together.
And?
And that's it.
Trust me, it works. How do
you think I played this one?
You did not play me.
Like a fiddle.
You know how many runway shows he sat
through before I would even look at him? Six.
It wasn't that many.
Six.
And when he finally asked
me out, I said, "okay."
but then at the last minute,I
backed out, saying I didn't feel well.
You weren't really sick?
God, no.
I had a pedicure and then
went to sardi's for drinks.
After that, he was my slave.
I rented a yacht that day!
Really? That's hilarious.
A week later, he gave me this.
I lost that deposit!
Eat your waffles! I'm teaching!
Look at you.
I know. Martha friggin' stewart, eh?
Hey, Ana. Yeah. I'm... I'm
not much of a-a mall guy.
Yeah. But, uh, I'll see you around, okay? Yep.
Mornin'.
Where were you last night?
Out.
Yeah, where "out"?
I drove around lookin' for you.
I couldn't sleep. I went a lot of places.
Happy now?
Don't be a wiseass. We were worried about you.
Nick, go take your shower. Go.
12 oranges for a half a cup
of juice? That's worth it.
No, thanks.
Okay, so we're sticking with
the moody teenager thing, huh?
Come on. What'd you do last night?
I already told dad. I went out.
Danny, it's me.
What did I do when peter spadaro pushed
you off the swing set in first grade, huh?
I threw a slushee in his mom's face.
Clearly, I have your back. Talk to me.
I went out drinking.
There's nothing else to do here, mom.
Look... I know this move has been hard on
you, but try to make the best of it, okay?
Trust me, it takes a lot
more effort to be unhappy.
Okay.
Thanks for being honest.
And that's for drinking.
Mom, was that you throwing up
in the bathroom this morning?
Yeah. I was just feeling a little nauseous.
Mm, sick in the morning.
If you weren't so old, I'd say you were pregnant.
Okay, guys, here's the deal.
I had some bad seafood last night.
At the wedding? We had chicken.
I mean after that. I went out
to get gas, and I had... Clams.
I don't even remember where I ate them.
I just remember seeing
this sign that said "clams, "
and I thought, "ooh, I haven't
had clams for a while."
so I went in and had clams, but they
were bad, which is why I was throwing up.
Well, my point was, next time, please flush.
And I'm done with my oatmeal.
What? We said we weren't gonna tell the
kids until after the first trimester.
That's next friday.
Wow, you actually know the day.
Wow, you're really into this.
Well, someone has to be.
I'm not telling anybody until we're
absolutely sure everything's okay.
Really? Are you sure that's the
only reason you're not telling them?
I can't open my eyes all the way. Who is it?
Did someone have too
much wine at the wedding?
I don't know. I was too drunk to notice.
I'm sorry to bother you.
I'm just looking for Bree.
Oh, she's not here.
Where'd she go?
I don't know.
I just woke up, and she was already gone.
She's not in the test kitchen?
No.
I just wanted to let her know
I'm taking the morning off.
Well, I'm sure she'll understand,
given all you've been through.
What do you mean?
Well, you know, Mike and
Susan getting married.
Oh, I'm not upset about that.
Really? Good. I'm glad.
I mean, it's not as if it's gonna last.
Excuse me?
Oh, Mike doesn't really love Susan.
He just feels sorry for her. He'll be back.
My thoughts exactly.
That... was amazing.
Yeah. Who knew you
were such a wild woman?
I'm not. I've never done this before.
Well, you are a fast learner.
No.
I mean, sex for me has always had to have an
emotional, romantic or even spiritual dimension.
I can see now you can take all
of that away and it's still...
Marvelous recreation.
The best there is.
Except, of course, when you actually tried to...
I'm sorry.
I mean, really.
Well, some people like it.
You've done this a lot, haven't you?
You don't stay this good by skipping practice.
God, you're a pig. Kiss me.
Hold that thought.
Well, that's weird. It's Mike. Hello?
Hey, Karl, listen.
There's no easy way to say this,
but something's happened to Julie.
I mean, she was just lying there.
What if we hadn't found her in time?
Thank god you did.
How could this happen? I mean, Julie's,
like, the nicest girl in the world.
I know. Who'd want to hurt her?
Okay, I gotta go. We'll call you from
the hospital as soon as we hear anything.
Tell Susan and Mike we'll take good care of M.J.
This is insane. How could someone strangle Julie?
I know, and on our property. It could've been me.
I've never had much upper body strength.
I'd love to say he means well, but...
What are you looking at?
Well, this horrible thing happened.
We're all out here trying to make sense of it.
Where are they?
Oh, they were out here... for a minute.
You know, when you think about it, how
much do we even know about these people?
Not much. They're from New York. They have a son...
Danny, who I saw coming out of a
movie the other night with Julie.
Seriously? Like a date?
Sure looked that way.
You know, when women are attacked, the police
look at the husbands or the boyfriends first.
Maybe it's time that we get to know our new neighbors.
Okay, they are all looking at our place, and
I do not think they are admiring our azaleas.
Why are they staring at us?
Oh, let's see.
Uh, we're the new people on the block,
Mrs. Mccluskey saw you fightin' with Julie,
and, uh, this morning,  she turns up almost dead.
What, are you kidding me? I had
nothing to do with that. I like Julie.
Then what were you fightin' about?
Nothin'. It's personal.
You're not gettin' how serious this is.
If that old lady talks to
the cops, we got problems.
Okay, okay.
Danny, just tell me where you went
when you were drinking last night.
I keep trying to remember.
I... I think I was at the park.
I drove by the park. You weren't there.
I drank a lot, okay? It's a little fuzzy.
That's great, Danny, you
know? That's really great.
All right, if anybody asks, let's
just say he was home with us.
No, because if anybody saw him out, we're done.
Maybe the old lady won't talk to the cops.
Uh, maybe I won't need an alibi.
Danny, people are already lookin' over here!
Maybe that is because we are hiding
in our house like guilty people.
Now I am going to make
Susan and Mike a manicott'.
And then we are going to get out
there and start hugging people.
The cops are going door-to-door asking questions.
Won't be long before they're here.
What am I gonna tell them, huh?
The truth... that you saw that
bolen kid fighting with Julie.
Well, it was just a couple of
words. They're kids. They argue.
If I start pointing fingers...
You're just telling 'em what you know.
What if I'm wrong?
I can't have another family
on this street hating me.
Who hates you?
Oh, the gay guys. I've said stuff.
Listen to me.
You know you've gotta do the right thing.
Yeah.
But you don't have to do it alone.
I'm gonna be right here with ya. And...
There was something I wanted to say
before, and I didn't get the chance.
If you got hit by a bus, I'd really miss you.
That's it?
Okay. You're showering alone tonight.
All right, I love you. There. I said it.
Do you mean it, or is that just
your beta-blockers talkin'?
We'll find out in an hour.
So you can't think of anyone who
would want to hurt your daughter?
No, I told you. She's a great
kid. Everybody loves her.
Where is that doctor?
He'll be here as soon as he can.
Was she dating anyone?
No.
You sure?
Yes, I'm sure.
If she was dating somebody, I would know.
He said he would be here.
Mrs. Delfino, I know how difficult this is for you.
Really? Has your daughter been attacked?
Hey, um, you know what?
How about we do this after
she talks to the doctor?
Okay.
Susan! How is she?
We don't know yet. Uh, nobody's talking to us.
Do you need somebody to take care of M.J.?
Uh, bob and lee are watching him.
Mrs. Delfino?
Dr. Hill, what is going on?
She's still unconscious.
I'd like to run some tests to make
sure there's no internal bleeding.
What kind of tests?
Blood work, some x-rays.
Um, can... can we go with you?
Of course.
Can I talk to you?
Uh, we really need to move here.
I... I... I don't think you
should give her an X-ray.
Lynette, just let him do his job.
Julie's pregnant.
What?
She might be. She's not sure.
What are you talking about?
She told me.
It's no problem. I can give her an M.R.I.
There's no radiation, so it's safer for the baby.
Hey, guys. What's up?
Uh, we're just taking some
food over to Mike and Susan's.
You know, we feel so
awful about what happened.
Nick, you talk to the guys.
I'm gonna get this over there while it's still hot, okay?
Okay.
So, nick, after what happened to Julie, we're
thinking of starting up a neighborhood watch.
Are you interested?
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, of course.
Great.
Danny must be pretty shaken up. He's... he's
pretty close with Julie, isn't he?
I think we're all pretty shaken up.
Weren't they, uh, dating, though?
No, no, just friends.
Uh, she was helpin' him with some tutoring.
Really?
Yeah.
'Cause some people saw
them at the movies together.
Like I said, just friends.
So this neighborhood watch thing...
is there, uh, gonna be a meeting?
Yeah, we'll let you know.
Is this... is this really about
the neighborhood watch?
'Cause it seems like the only
one you're watching is my kid.
Honey! It's your mother.
We're done. Right, guys?
Thanks, hon.
That, uh, didn't look like it was going so good.
Yeah, they were asking about Danny.
It's like you said they would.
Then it is time to get our son an alibi.
Katherine.
I saw you drive in.
Uh, yeah, I just wanted to come home and take
a shower before I head back to the hospital.
Look, I know things have been... awkward lately.
But I heard about Julie,
and I wanted to do something.
Thank you. I know Susan will appreciate it.
So... How is Julie?
Yeah, we don't know. They're still doing tests.
Oh, god. I can't imagine
what you're going through.
You have to stay strong, Mike.
Katherine?
Whoa, wait, wait. What are you doing?
Just letting you know I'm here for you.
Anytime.
Come on in.
Ana, there are two detectives here
who wanna ask you some questions.
What about?
We're investigating the Julie Mayer assault.
Where were you last night
at approximately 11:00?
Oh, I can answer that. She was in her room.
We have a very strict 10:00 p.m. curfew.
Actually, I was out.
What? I saw you go into your room.
Yeah, and then I climbed down
the trellis and I met a friend.
Can I borrow your mace?
Please, ma'am.
My tax dollars pay for
it. I should get to use it.
Who was the friend you met?
Danny Bolen.
Wait, Danny Bolen?
As in the guy who blew you off this morning?
Yes. He's a friend.
I want him to be more than a friend.
Mr. Bolen said that you
stopped by a liquor store.
No. No, no. She's 16. She doesn't drink.
Yeah, we bought some beer.
How about a taser? You
guys must carry a taser.
Can anybody verify your whereabouts?
Well... Danny.
Okay. Thanks for your time.
You know why kids are like this now?
Because you people won't
let us hit them anymore.
If I find this bastard before the cops do,
he won't need a trial 'cause
I'll kill him with my bare hands.
Look, I know you're mad. I don't
want to hear anger in this room.
We need to stay positive for Julie's sake.
Do we even have a clue who did this?
A jealous boyfriend, maybe?
Was she even seeing anyone?
No, not that I know of.
Is this a bad time?
No, no. Come on in.
Oh, how is she?
Still unconscious. We're
waiting for the test results.
Karl.
Bree.
You know, I need to talk to
Lynette. I'll be back in ten minutes.
She must never ever know I slept with you.
Bree, my daughter was attacked.
I've got more to worry about
than Susan getting mad at us.
Of course. I'm sorry.
Look, I know we said we'd
get together this week,
but till this all gets sorted
out, I... I need a little time.
I completely understand.
I do want to see you again. Really.
Just not now.
Okay.
Dad?
So what did they say?
The doctors still don't
know. But she's not pregnant.
I'm so sorry about that. I
just had to say something.
What made you think that she might be?
She told me.
A few days ago, I was out in my yard.
I was upset.
Julie saw me and asked me what was wrong.
We started talking about stuff, and...
It just came out.
Th... and you didn't just...
just immediately pick up the phone and call me?
She asked me not to.
So who's the guy?
I don't know.
She didn't say?
All she said was she'd gotten involved
with someone and that it was complicated.
Complicated? And that's the word she used?
Yeah.
Because..."complicated" means "trouble, "
so you knew that she was in trouble,
and you chose not to come to me?
Like I said, Julie asked me not to.
You are my friend, not hers.
After everything we've been through, I
cannot believe you would betray me like that.
Whoa, that's not fair.
Lynette, my daughter is hooked up to a machine,
and a guy who is complicating her life...
a guy that I didn't even know about... might've
put her there, so I don't need to be fair.
Hey, reggie. Thanks for coming so quickly.
No problem, Mrs. Solis.
How are those two little precious ones?
What?
Oh, my kids. Oh, you threw me off with "precious."
they're the least of my problems.
We've taken in a teenager.
Sorry to hear it.
Yeah, she's been using this to sneak out at
night. That's why I want you to take it down.
She climbed down this trellis?
Yeah, that's what she said.
Okay. It's just that it's pretty beat up.
I wouldn't have thought it could
hold much more than those roses.
But then again, why would
she lie? I'll get my tools.
I'm telling you, she opened her
eyes for at least 10 or 15 seconds.
She called me "dad."
I believe you.
Well, what does it mean?
Well, in layman's terms, drifting in and out
of consciousness is better than fully comatose.
Our main concern is the intracranial swelling.
In fact, if she wakes up, we
may choose to induce coma.
Well, why would you do that?
The swelling will heal faster if she's unconscious.
But I'm confident she'll recover.
Thank god. I should find Susan.
Good lord. They need me in the E.R.
Um, before you go, one quick question.
When Julie wakes up, will she remember what she
saw or heard during the brief moment she was awake?
I don't see why not.
But people in comas dream, don't they?
She could wake up thinking she saw something
odd when really it was just a bizarre dream.
Not very likely.
Her brain is swollen. That
has to cause hallucinations.
I once thought lauren bacall was in my
bedroom, and that was just a high fever.
Ma'am, there's been a bus crash. I need to go.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Uh, talk to your friend. You may
be surprised what she remembers.
Liar!
What?
There is no way you crawled down that trellis,
because I just tried to, and
it collapsed on top of me.
What's your answer to that?
I don't know.
Pull back on the carbs
and try again in two weeks?
Wh... Ana, this is serious.
Why would you lie to the cops?
Did Danny ask you to cover up for him?
I'm not covering up anything. Danny didn't do it.
Well, the police think he
did. You don't know this kid.
I know him better than the cops.
You're just mad because
I didn't take your advice.
What are you talking about?
You told me to play hard to
get, which is totally lame.
I figured out a way to make him owe me.
Aiding and abetting?
This is your solution on how to land a guy?
Who are you calling?
The police.
No!
Julie Mayer is lying in a hospital bed right
now, and Danny might have put her there.
You're telling the truth.
Bree, you're back.
I brought you your favorite biscotti.
Aw, you are so sweet.
And I hear Julie's doing better.
Much better. She's just sedated now.
The doctors are very optimistic.
Oh, my, that is good news.
You know, I wanted to tell you again
how much I enjoyed your wedding,
especially the part where
you and Katherine made peace.
Well, I'm glad someone enjoyed that.
But you are friends again, right?
I mean, you said all those lovely
things to her in the church.
Yeah, but it wasn't enough for Katherine.
You know, I don't know where she
gets off being the injured party.
She took Mike from me first.
But you and Mike were divorced at the time.
And... and Katherine was very lonely.
Okay, rule number one of the female code...
never sleep with your friend's ex-husband.
Well, uh, perhaps she should've seen
that you still had feelings for Mike.
It would've been different if she'd slept with...
Oh, let's say for instance, Karl.
Karl? Oh, yeah, like that would ever happen.
No, Katherine's a lady.
She's not one of those dumb skanks
that would fall for Karl's come-ons.
So you agree it would be different?
Much different. Worse.
Worse? Why worse?
Because Karl hurt me. He cheated and lied.
I mean, any friend who would know
all that and sleep with him anyway?
I would never talk to her again.
I don't blame you for
defending Katherine. But...
I just don't need a friend like her in my
life, especially when I have a friend like you.
Orson. Come in.
Uh, I'm getting everybody
to sign a get well card.
We're sending it over to Julie.
Oh, that's nice.
I suppose I should sign it somewhere
inconspicuous, given recent events.
I suppose.
By the way, this morning when I said
that Mike and Susan wouldn't last?
I know you thought I was crazy.
No. I didn't think that... exactly.
Well, F.Y.I., I stopped by their
house today with a casserole.
Mike was there... Alone.
Let's just say he was grateful. Very grateful.
Why wouldn't he be?
God, you have no ear for innuendo at all!
He made a pass at me.
With Julie in the hospital
and his marriage one day old?
Well... It may be the first day, but.
He's clearing having second thoughts.
Oh, and. Please don't tell Bree.
I'd hate for this to get back to Susan.
I hear Julie opened her eyes. That's great.
Yes. Yes, it is.
I'm sorry you're mad at me.
Yeah, I'm not mad.
I just can't understand why
she went to you instead of me.
That day that Julie found me crying?
The reason she opened up to me
was because I told her that...
and no one else can know
about this... I'm pregnant.
You are?
That's amazing.
Wait. Why were you crying?
Let's see. Uh, I'm in my 40s,
my husband is back in school,
I'm the sole breadwinner,
I don't know how I'm gonna do
this whole baby thing again,
and... also because...
What?
Because I can't quiet that one
voice in my mind that keeps saying...
Maybe I shouldn't.
Oh, honey.
Yeah.
Lynette, uh...
You can do whatever you
think it is you need to do.
Yeah. I know. Lucky me.
It's weird. Everybody talks
about a kid being a gift.
It's the only gift where you puke for nine months
before you receive it and
then scream the day it arrives.
That's true.
But they are a gift, Lynette.
I know that because...
I spent the last few hours thinking that I was...
Gonna lose mine.
I realized that I would...
Trade everything I own, I would
give everything I ever will have,
for just one more day as Julie's mom.
But I'm not telling you what you should do.
Actually, you are.
And I'm glad you did.
I had some briefs to finish, but i'd
rather work here than at the office.
Hey, Bree. You're still here?
Oh, she's kept me company all day.
Is she a saint or what?
Hey, Lee. Thanks for calling me back.
Uh, I'm just checking on M.J.
This has been the longest day of my life.
I thought I needed some time to myself.
I was wrong.
I... I need you.
I booked our room at the
motel. Here's the key.
If you could come by, even for just an hour...
Well, it would mean a lot to me.
Please.
I... I don't want to be alone tonight.
Neither do I.
Hey, Gaby.
Hey, you got a minute?
Oh, I think I know why you're here, and
believe me, I am as ticked off as you are.
Angie...
No, no, no, no.
Danny should've never kept your niece out so late.
When I found out, I kicked him so hard, he's
still trying to get the shoe out of his butt.
It'll never happen again.
It never happened at all.
What?
Ana wasn't with Danny last
night. She never left the house.
What are you talking about?
She snuck out. Danny bought
her beer. They both fessed up.
Ana was lying.
Well, why would she lie?
Because your son told her to.
Well, maybe she was changing her tune 'cause
she didn't want to get in trouble with you.
No. No! She's covering for Danny.
I don't know what you're
implying, but he's a good kid.
Your niece is the one that's
been hounding him day and night.
Hey, I'm just trying to be nice here.
I'm giving you a heads up that
Ana's taking her story back.
Let's slow down here, okay?
Can I at least talk to the girl
before she goes pointin' fingers?
Too late. She's talking to the police right now.
Baby, I screwed up.
What happened?
I never should've told you
to ask that girl for an alibi.
Did she talk to the cops?
Yeah, which means they
should be here any second.
But I didn't do anything. I...
We don't have time for that. You're a suspect.
They have the right to question you.
Ma...
Just listen to me.
Tell 'em you will not waive your Miranda rights.
And we will have a lawyer
down there as soon as we can.
Remember, how does a fish get caught?
He opens his mouth.
It had been a horrible day,
and people in the neighborhood
were doing their best to recover.
One mother was about to share
some good news with her family
when her son saw a flashing light in the window.
Another was busy grounding her niece
when she noticed the police car
pulling up across the street.
a woman was planning a
rendezvous with her lover
when she saw a young man
being taken out of his house.
Within moments, everyone had heard
the son of one housewife was suspected
of strangling the daughter of another.
Yes, it had been a horrible day.
And the thought occurred to one old woman...
the days ahead could be worse.
Resync by honeybunny</font>
I'm getting married, and
I don't wanna screw it up,
'cause enough of those screwups,
and you just end up alone.
Gaby discovered that old flames...
Yeah, that can happen.
Can leave embers.
Do you at least know why he steals?
I steal to hurt you.
Bree's tortured marriage...
I'm not your wife anymore,
Orson. I'm your captive.
Don't you feel any remorse at all over that?
Guilt is a small price to pay for happiness.
Led her into an affair with Karl.
What happened to the good girl?
She decided guilt's a small
price to pay for happiness.
Lynette revealed a closely guarded secret.
No one else can know about this.
I'm pregnant.
You are?
Something's happened to Julie.
And when a crime was committed...
How does a fish get caught?
He opens his mouth.
A suspect emerged.
There's a certain kind of woman
you see in the suburbs.
She waits for the school bus in her bathrobe.
She stops by the post office
with curlers in her hair.
She goes to the market in
sweatpants and a t-shirt.
This woman is a housewife,
and she doesn't bother
trying to be beautiful
because...
it's a waste of time.
I was trying to hit Celia.
Well, get better aim!
Ana, help me clean this mess.
Don't up your volume on me.
Juanita, finish those vegetables.
Don't make me count to three.
Oh, don't give me that look,
you sawed off little...
Gaby?
Oh, my God.
John. Hi.
Wow. What a surprise.
I was so busy back in the kitchen
I didn't even know you guys were here.
How are you?
Well, I'm usually better
when I don't have creamed spinach all over me.
Uh, so... are you working here?
Hey, nothing wrong with waitin' tables.
Could you get us some more bread?
You know, maybe I could bring
you some dessert on the House.
I'll just go ask the owner.
Oh, wait. That's me.
Honestly? You own this place?
I bought it with the money I got
in my divorce settlement.
Really? You're divorced?
Yep. Almost a year now.
Oh, my God. Are... are these your kids?
Yeah. This is Celia and Juanita,
and this is our niece Ana.
Hello.
Hi.
I can see the family resemblance.
She's my niece.
Wow.
It must've been a windy day when
the apple fell from that tree.
Well, it was... it was
great seeing you again.
You, too.
Still don't see any bread here.
I'll be right back.
Yes,
there's a certain kind
of woman you only meet in the suburbs.
She will try to look beautiful
if she has someone to look beautiful for.
On this street,
the day begins with a cup of coffee.
Most need it to wake up.
Some can't read
their morning paper without it.
A few like to drink it on their way to work.
Then there are those
who just want something
to hold in their hands
while they discuss the neighbors.
Well, Danny had me fooled.
He seemed like a pretty nice kid.
Yeah, except for the strangling.
Sorry.
Oh, it's okay. I'm just happy that Julie's safe
and they caught the guy.
Uh, Susan.
Bob.
Go inside.
Go inside.
Hey, Susan.
I'm confused. The... the last I heard,
the police had Danny Bolen in custody.
Danny was never under arrest.
The police were questioning him,
but they had no grounds to hold him.
Okay, that sounds like his lawyer talking.
Are you his lawyer?
Susan, you know how much I love Julie,
but they have no evidence against this kid,
and I couldn't just let him sit there. If he
didn't do it, why would need to fake his alibi?
Because he's a kid and he was scared.
Angie, this is not a good idea.
I... I just gotta say this. Susan, please.
I can't even imagine what
you've been going through.
I am begging you, as
my friend and neighbor,
don't defend him.
Susan, it's my job.
Then I don't know how you sleep at night.
Susan, wait.
Come on. Can... can we
please just talk about this?
We can go inside, just the two of us.
No.
You wanna talk about this?
Let's do it out here in the
open. Hey, everybody!
Her son tried to kill my daughter.
And while he's here,
nobody on this street is safe.
What is this?
Bacon and cheese burrito.
You couldn't find any croissants
or pain au chocolat?
Sweetie, we're at a motor lodge
on the interstate.
I was lucky to find a burrito.
People always talk about
the moral hazards of cheating.
No one warns you about the food.
Mmm.
Mmm.
So you want me to book this place for
tomorrow? Mm, sorry, I have an event.
Oh, wait. You know, I think I do, too.
How's this then? We'll go
to Vegas for the weekend?
Las Vegas?
Why not?
I'll lose my shirt in the casino,
and then we'll head upstairs,
and you can lose yours.
I can't disappear for a whole weekend.
My husband would notice.
Say you're visiting family.
Karl!
I'm sorry, but I don't see us
having romantic getaways.
That's the sort of thing
a woman does with a
man she's in love with.
And we don't have those
kinds of feelings. I get it.
But you are a delightful diversion.
And in order to keep things delightful,
I think it's best
we not put unreasonable
demands on each other.
Okay. Fine.
You could've said, "pass the sugar. "
I didn't want to make a demand.
So... I know you guys have been concerned
'cause I've been so sick in the mornings.
Well, I wanted to let you know why.
I'm pregnant with twins.
Well, now that the celebration's
over, any questions?
Yeah. Aren't you gonna be,
like, the world's oldest mom?
No. There's a woman in Mongolia
who's got me beat.
Any other questions?
I have more of a statement.
You two are so irresponsible.
You should've been using birth control.
You're in college.
Do you know what the odds
are now that you'll graduate?
Like, zero.
You... you have a new job,
one that you'll have to quit
Once the baby comes.
So I hope you're both happy.
You've just destroyed your futures
for a few minutes of pleasure.
Not to mention, it's so gross
you're still doing it.
Penny, you're excited about this, right?
Yeah, getting two little babies to play with.
If they're boys, I'm outta here.
You have to understand,
even though they've released Danny,
it doesn't mean he's not still a suspect.
So what do we do?
Well, the police are gonna start
digging into your background,
so I need to know what they're gonna find.
You're from New York, right?
Yeah.
But instead of wasting your time
poking around in the past,
you just need to back up Danny's story.
Right, just check out the liquor
stores, see if anyone saw him. I will,
but the police are gonna talk to
people in your old neighborhood,
see if he's got any run-ins
with the law, with girls.
Is there anything I need to know, Danny?
Nope.
Not a thing.
Okay... but I still need
to establish character.
So I'll need to get in touch
with some old teachers, friends.
Nah, you don't need to do all that.
Look, what are we doing here?
I can't defend a client
I know nothing about.
Why can't you answer just
a few simple questions?
You wanna know why? Because
this family has secrets! Danny.
Big dark secrets that we can't talk about,
not even to our lawyer.
You know, who cares if it makes me look
guilty, even if I'm not? Knock it off!
This conversation was privileged, right?
So I don't know if you heard,
but this morning the police
released Danny Bolen.
I heard. You must be worried sick.
I am.
Clearly, he's unstable. Who
knows what he might do next?
So what are we gonna do about it?
You ever hear about
that old man on Maple Drive?
People found out he used to be
an accountant for the Nazis,
and they threw garbage all over his yard.
That's right. And he moved.
But then it was bought
by some ex-hippie who
painted the House pink,
so it was a pyrrhic victory at best.
Well, look, I'm just bringing this up
because I don't want people on this street
thinking that they're safe when they're not.
Susan.
Hey, uh, could you
give me a hand for a sec?
Honey, what are you doing?
Mona Clarke's got a big mouth.
If you get her worked up,
she's gonna tabout Danny to
everybody in the neighborhood.
So? So we don't want an angry mob
showing up at the Bolens' House,
especially if we aren't even sure
Danny's the one that attacked Julie.
He lied about his alibi.
Why would he do that if he was innocent?
Well...
that's a good point.
And how can I live with myself
if someone else's daughter gets attacked,
and I have said nothing?
Okay. Okay, I get it.
It's just, this whole thing would be a lot easier
if the police just had some proof.
Well, maybe we should get them some.
Is there anything I can help you with?
No, I think everything fine. Uh...
John.
Hey.
I wanted to talk to you about something.
I thought I should do it
in person, out of respect.
Uh-huh.
Your niece came to my restaurant.
She asked me for a hostessing job.
And I think she'd be great.
You know, but given our history,
I wanted to make sure
you were okay with it.
Because I wouldn't do it
if it would make you feel uncomfortable.
I mean, that's the last thing I'd want.
Like I said, given our... history.
Yeah.
Why don't you stop saying,
"given our history"
and just say, "I banged your wife"?
You know, it's not that
I haven't forgiven you.
It's just that every time I see you,
I wanna put my fist in your face.
Now did you park in the building?
'Cause we validate.
You know what?
I think this was a bad idea.
Besides, Gaby probably
wouldn't have liked it anyway.
What?
Come on.
I mean, her niece working for me...
I think she would've freaked out.
You know...
given our history.
John?
Hold on a second.
Ana working for John? Are you nuts?
You're the one who's been saying
she should get a job.
Yeah, at the mall hocking soft pretzels,
not working for...
Your ex-lover?
Well, yeah.
How can you not think it's awkward?
Because that was years ago.
We're past all that, right?
Of course we are.
It's just... the whole thing
makes me uncomfortable.
I'm sorry. I'm gonna have to say no.
I knew it. You're jealous.
Jealous? Of who?
Your beautiful niece
working for your ex-lover.
What?!
You still have the hots for him.
Oh, don't deny it.
I saw you.
"Really? You're divorced?"
Okay. First of all, you just
reminded me why I hate mimes.
Secondly, is that why you're
letting Ana work for John?
You were testing me?
Yeah, and you failed.
Carlos, you are way out of line.
Deny it all you want,
but I know what I saw.
You wanted to look pretty
for your ex-lover.
Well...
You know, he was also my ex-gardener.
Can't you call him that?
It's so long since I've
seen you two together.
I was starting to wonder if you'd split up.
Oh! No, we're still married.
No, just try getting away from this one!
Arm.
Bree, I know you're unhappy,
but we haven't been out in months.
Could you at least make
an effort for one night?
You are absolutely right.
Why don't you get me
one of those crab puffs,
and then we'll mingle?
Sweetheart, this is just what I'm...
Crab puff.
Karl!
Bree? What are you doing here?
What do you mean?
Are you following me?
No. I'm a member of the club.
I... I had no idea that this was the event
that you were talking about.
Oh, so you expect me to believe
that you showed up at a dinner dance alone?
No, I... actually, I...
Karl, I know you have feelings for me,
but I would hate to see them
turn into some kind of...
Obsession.
Hey, hon. Find our table?
A... and you were saying?
So, Karl, aren't you going to introduce me?
This is Candace. She's an old friend.
Oh, don't you mean that you're her old friend?
Candace, why don't we
go find our table, huh?
Bree, if we don't run
into you again... good.
He doesn't mean to be brusque.
He's just a little eager
to rush through dinner...
So we can get to the motor lodge.
Motor lodge?
He wanted to go earlier, but I said no.
Lobster first,
then "dessert. "
Candace, why don't we start
putting that lobster
in your mouth right now?
Goodbye, Bree.
Candace?
Dr. Hodge!
Oh, jeez.
You two know each other? Yes,
Candace was a dental patient of mine.
Still think of you every time
I put in my night guard.
Listen, there's room at our table.
Would you care to join us? No! I
mean, we're going to be leaving soon.
You know, that motor lodge can wait.
That way, Orson and Candace can catch up,
and you and I can have a little talk, too.
Sure. That sounds like fun.
Karl and I will just go get
a couple apple martinis,
and we'll come right back.
Lovely girl, isn't she?
Hmm.
Her two front teeth?
Veneers.
I'm guessing those aren't
her only side by side enhancements.
She's actually very sweet.
Shame to see her mixed up
with a dog like Karl.
You have to pity any woman
who makes that mistake.
Yes, you do.
Susan?
Oh! Shh! Shh!
Get in! Get in! Get in! Get in!
What are you doing?
Stay low!
Oh! Okay, let's try that again.
What are you doing?
Surveillance.
I am gonna nail that Danny Bolen kid.
I... I thought the police were...
The police are useless.
So I'm keeping a log of
all his comings and goings.
If he leaves, and another girl gets attacked,
he won't be able to lie and say he was home.
Well... I got a few minutes to kill.
Oh, by the way, I was gonna call you.
You haven't told Gaby I'm
pregnant, have you? No. Why?
Well, I haven't had a
chance to tell Carlos yet,
and I really think he should hear it from me...
Get down!
Oh!
You think I'm nuts, don't you?
No.
I think you're a mother.
Thank you.
Although speaking as a fellow mother...
Do you remember
what happened to Porter?
Everyone in town was so sure
he set that fire and killed those people.
People can be sure,
and they can be wrong.
I'm not wrong.
Okay.
What are you doing?
Following him. Buckle up.
No, I can't! I have to put
a meatloaf in the oven! Oh!
Oh!
Wait! Wait! I forgot my...
So, Candace, what do you do for a living?
I'm a dancer.
Oh, what kind? Jazz? Ballet? Lap?
Actually, Candace was a rockette.
Oh! It must've been exhausting
Spending so much time
with your legs in the air.
I... love this song.
Bree... would you care to dance?
Sorry, my shoes are killing me.
Ask Candace. She's the pro.
I'd love to.
Have fun, you two!
You loathsome pig.
You're supposed to be cheating
with me, not on me.
I asked if you were free.
You weren't. I called Candace.
What's the problem?
Well, it's just that she's so... cheap.
She's beneath you.
Not yet, but she will be.
Bravo!
Well done!
If her dress were any lower, it'd be a belt.
Gosh, Bree, could this
be jealousy I'm hearing?
I'm not jealous. I'm appalled.
And as long as we're together,
I will not have you running
around with other women.
But we're not together.
I'm just a diversion, remember?
A little fling to spice up an afternoon.
And if that's all I am to you, fine.
But you don't get to say
What I can do when the afternoon's over.
Are you gonna take her
to our motor lodge tonight?
Just try and stop me.
Excuse me.
Someone over at the table
was looking for you.
What the hell happened here?
Ooh! Uh, Orson tripped.
Really, sweetheart. You
need to be more careful.
Oh, I'm so sorry. The floor was slippery.
Are you all right?
I think I broke my nose.
I should go to the emergency room.
Oh, dear. And you had such
lovely plans for the evening.
Hey, Janice. Is Carlos done
with his meeting yet?
I really need to talk to him.
Got a sec?
Never mind.
Something wrong?
How would you like
a parking space closer to the entrance?
I'd love it. You closed the door
for that? No, I closed the door
to ask if you would like
to be my new senior V.P.
Seriously?
Oh... God.
Carlos, I am... so flattered.
And I would love to say yes. It's just...
I know. More responsibility,
more hours away from home.
But you get a company car
and an expense account.
Which is very generous, but I
still can't accept because...
And a 50% salary bump.
Because it doesn't have a 50% salary bump.
But now that it does, I'm in.
When do I start?
Tonight.
We're having dinner
with a big potential client.
He is bringing his wife,
so please bring Tom.
Sure.
Wait.
Weren't you gonna
give this promotion to Judy?
I was.
But between you and me,
I found out she's pregnant.
Overheard her on the phone.
I saw what was coming...
doctor's visits, sick days, maternity leave.
Yeah, that can be annoying.
But isn't denying a woman a promotion
because she's pregnant a tiny bit illegal?
Only if she finds out.
And, I mean, who's gonna
tell her... my new senior V.P.?
Hell, no.
She's too busy thinking about
that big bump she's got coming.
Yes?
I've been thinking about last night,
and you, Karl, Candy...
and it finally hit me
what was really going on.
What are you talking about?
The oil on the dance floor...
that was no accident. You put it there.
You wanted Candy to fall.
That's ridiculous.
Admit it.
You were jealous of that girl
from the moment Karl walked in with her.
Orson, you're not making any sense.
Why would I be jealous of Karl's date?
Because she was dancing with me, of course.
I... I suppose I should be mad at you
for nearly breaking my
neck, but I'm too relieved.
Relieved?
Yes, if watching me
dance with a pretty girl
can make you that crazy,
then you obviously still care for me.
There's still hope for us.
Orson, you are reading way
too much into one impulsive act.
Ohh, argue all you like.
A woman doesn't pull a stunt like that
over a man she's not in love with.
Karl? Hi, it's Bree.
Um, I am thinking...
maybe I'm ready for that
weekend in Las Vegas.
Hi, Mrs. Bolen.
I'm a friend of Danny's
from school. Is he in?
You got a name?
Sorry. Eddie.
Danny! There's an Eddie here.
It's a nice House.
You know what happened here, right?
Huh? Oh, yeah.
What are you gonna do?
Hey. What's up?
Hey. My brakes are shot.
Is there any chance you
could take a look at 'em?
Nah. I... I don't feel like it, Eddie.
Come on. You've been moping
around the House all day.
Go. Help your buddy.
Okay.
I'm glad one of us has a friend.
I was the supermarket earlier.
Everybody was looking at me
like I had their grandmother in my trunk.
Yeah. While you were out,
three hate calls in one hour.
I don't know. I'm startin' to think
it's time to get out
of the Bolen business.
No.
We cannot change our names and run
every time there's a little trouble.
This is more than a little trouble, babe.
I don't care.
We are not putting Danny
through all that again.
And maybe this hasn't worked
out they way we'd hoped.
But until I say otherwise,
we are Nick and Angie Bolen.
Hey, can you go into the... the basement
and get me a work light?
Yeah.
Thanks.
Got a second?
Sure.
I'm really sorry about what happened to Julie.
Thanks. Actually, that's what
I wanted to talk to you about.
I didn't hurt her,
mrs. Delfino.
But you did fight with her.
I mean, Mrs. McCluskey saw you.
What were you fighting with her about?
I'm sorry. That lawyer told me
that I shouldn't talk to
anybody about this stuff.
I know that Julie thought she was pregnant.
What?
You didn't think I knew that, right?
Is that what you... fought about?
Um, I didn't know.
Is that why you attacked my daughter?
No, I... I didn't even know that.
You're lying.
No, I'm not.
You're lying!
Please, just leave me alone.
Hey! What are you doing?
I know that you did it.
I can see it in your eyes!
Mom! Dad! Help me!
Just admit that you did it!
Admit it! Admit it to me!
Mrs. Delfino, please.
Hey! Get the hell away from him!
Oh, are you gonna attack me?
Hey!
What the hell is wrong with you?
He did it! You know that he...
Ma! Careful!
You come near him again,
I swear I will kill you.
You can't protect him forever.
People know what he is now,
and he's gonna be punished.
Hey!
What the hell happened to my car?
Hi, uncle Carlos.
Your clients are here. I put him at
our best table. Thank you, sweetie.
Lynette?
Yeah?
Are you sure about this?
About being senior V.P.
with a 50% salary bump?
Uh, yeah. But did you hear the way
he described the job in the car?
I mean, it sounds like a killer schedule.
I can handle it. And you get to stay in school.
Remember your big dream? Our future?
Of course. But how are we
gonna keep it a secret?
Carlos is gonna find out
about this thing eventually.
By then, I will have proved
I can do the job,
pregnant or not.
Please?
Okay. I'm in.
But you gotta prove it fast.
Remember last time you were
pregnant with twins?
Every part of you swelled up.
It was like sleeping next to a body
they dragged out of the river.
You said I was beautiful.
I had to. You were twice my size.
This is a 2004 Barolo
from my vineyard in Piedmont.
Your vineyard?
Yeah. That's why I insisted on this restaurant.
Ey, uh, Carry Myel.
I love business, but wine is my passion.
Oh, none for me tonight.
Why not?
Well... I wanna keep my
head clear for business.
No. No business talk.
Tonight is about getting to know each other
over good food and fine wine.
Yeah, Lynette, his wine.
So drink up.
Well, I guess a little wouldn't hurt.
So...
Vic...
What do you suggest
to go with your wine?
Let me see.
Oh...
the carpaccio sounds like a nice starter.
Wow.
Lynette. You liked it, huh?
It was delicious.
Lucky for you, it's a big vineyard.
Oh.
Thank you.
Oh, look! One of the Pointer Sisters!
Sorry.
It was, um, just a nun.
Excuse me. I'll be right back.
Gaby, what the hell?
I know. I'm sorry I'm late.
I mean your clothes.
Didn't I see that shirt
in the hamper this morning?
I gave it a sniff. It has another day in it.
Gaby, this is an important business dinner.
Yeah, but it's also John Rowland's restaurant.
If I made myself pretty,
you might think I was doing it just for him.
Oh, God help me. Is that what this is about?
Well, I didn't want to run the risk
of failing another test.
Okay, Gaby, go change. You made your point.
Not quite.
For the past 11 years,
I have stood beside you
when you were poor and blind
and knocked me up twice.
At this point in our marriage,
if you still feel the need to test me,
then you're the one who's failed.
You're right.
I'm sorry.
Thank you. And for the record,
I only took my clip off
and shook out my hair
because I ran into somebody I knew.
I would've done it, if it
was Lynette Scavo, okay?
Okay.
So do you think you can go home and...
Oh, don't worry. I have clothes
and makeup in the car.
Good, because that shirt
did not have another day in it.
Hello?
Who is this?
What is your name?
Oh, you got a big mouth
for a guy with no name.
No, no, no, no. No, no, you listen to me.
You come anywhere near my family,
I will personally bash your brains in...
Assuming you have any!
You okay?
I'm fine. Just another moron
with some empty threats.
And what if they're not empty?
Do you know where your
father and I keep the gun?
Ma...
No, look, you're old enough know this stuff.
Just in case someone should try to come in
here and hurt you... I can take care of myself.
Well, just in case you can't
take care of yourself...
there is a loaded.38 Smith & Wesson in a box
in the second drawer in my dresser.
You got that?
What are you smiling at?
It's just...
it's not your typical
mother/son conversation.
You know I've always felt bad
about the way we've had to raise you,
being on the run and all.
If it weren't for me,
you coulda had a normal childhood.
Ma, you don't ever have
to apologize to me.
I'm glad you're not like other moms.
Thanks, baby.
I just wanna be a good one.
Remember...
aim for the head, not the legs.
So Patti comes downstairs,
and sitting under the Christmas tree
is the cutest Golden Retriever
puppy you ever saw.
Oh, it was the best present I ever got.
Aw.
Do you like dogs, Lynette?
Ooh, I love 'em!
But Penny is allergic,
so we got fish.
Fish suck.
Swim, die, flush... new one.
You know, what dog I'd really
like is the Reima-Waner.
Weimaraner.
A window-hammer.
Weimaraner.
Rammerjammer.
Nette, make him stop.
Gaby, you know, I... I
wanna tell you something,
but I'm afraid it's gonna come out wrong.
Your boobs look great in that dress.
Well, Tom, how could that
possibly come out wrong?
Yu'd be surprised.
Well, you'll have to excuse Tom.
He's a bit of a lightweight.
And your wine is so delicious, he couldn't resist.
But look at you. You had at least a bottle,
and you'd never know. Might as
well finish this off. No, no, no!
If she has one more glass, I'm gonna puke.
I just talked to Bob.
Why would you do that?
He asked me to stop by...
because he wanted to tell me that the police
have evidence that clears Danny Bolen.
What?
They've got a shot
from a security camera at Fairview liquors
that puts him there at the time Julie was attacked.
How would they know that?
There was a time stamp.
They don't know the exact time of the attack.
The camera shows him
sitting in the parking lot
drinking beer for over an hour.
He couldn't have done it.
I can't believe this.
That means that Julie's
attacker is still out there.
And I've been going up and down the street
telling everybody that Danny Bolen did it.
Your daughter was hurt.
You wanted somebody to blame.
People get that.
Oh, God. I'm... I'm so sorry.
Well, I'm sure the Bolens will understand.
No, not just to them.
To you.
What are you talking about?
Well, you woke up the morning
after your wedding
and found yourself
married to a madwoman.
I have been...
just totally obsessed with
finding Julie's attacker, and...
I said, "for better or worse. "
So we start with the worse.
Wow, glad this night's over. I'm exhausted.
Yeah, me, too.
You coming to bed?
I'll be up in a sec. I'm gonna turn off some lights.
On this street, the day
begins with a cup of coffee.
Some drink it while recalling
a lover they once cared for.
Some pour it, thinking of
the boss they must lie to.
Others sip it,
contemplating a man
they might be in love with.
But for one woman,
on this particular morning,
that cup of coffee has to wait...
because she discovers
a neighbor in trouble.
She goes to help,
not only because it's
the right thing to do,
But because it's the only
way she can think of...
to ask for forgiveness.
And once it is given...
the day begins.

Previously
on Desperate Housewives...
A proposal was made...
Your niece came to my restaurant
asked me for a hostessing job.
I'm sorry.
Another was broken.
You don't have...
Mike, please.
A secret was kept...
Carlos is gonna find out eventually.
By then, I will have proved
I can do the job, pregnant or not.
She's still unconscious.
I'd like to run some tests.
Another revealed...
Julie's pregnant.
Bree Van De Kamp
was having an affair.
And whenever her lover called...
She needed an excuse
to leave work early.
I'm off to the jeweler's.
Gotta get my pearls restrung.
I'm off to the salon.
Gotta keep this red hair red.
I have to visit my aunt in the hospital.
She has shingles.
But on this particular day,
Bree was surprised to find
Her work had been done for her.
Morning!
It's barely 9:00.
How long have you been cooking?
I don't know.
Since 3:00? 4:00?
You don't need to do
this whole luncheon by yourself.
I don't mind.
When I'm happy,
I have all this excess energy.
Gotta channel it somewhere.
You must be pretty darn happy.
Any particular reason?
Isn't it obvious?
I'm in love.
That's wonderful!
Why didn't you tell me
you were seeing someone?
You know what? It doesn't matter. The
main thing is you're finally over Mike.
I'm not over Mike.
You're not?
No, silly. Who'd you think
I was in love with?
But Mike just married Susan.
Honey. Their first marriage
went down in flames.
This one's gonna crash even faster.
They're not even sleeping together.
What makes you say that?
Last night, The light in their
upstairs den was on at 3:00 A.M.
That doesn't mean anything.
Maybe Susan wanted to read
without waking him.
Mike made a mistake and he knows it.
He's just waiting for Julie to
feel better, and then he'll dump Susan
and beg me to take him back.
So... grab an apron.
We still have dessert to make.
I'm thinking tarte tatin.
It's Mike's favorite.
We'll make an extra one for him.
Poor Bree.
She wanted to help her friend.
Bree... are you coming?
Karl
But she didn't have time to deal with
Katherine's imaginary lover...
I have a teeth cleaning,
so I won't be able to help you.
Not when she had a real one.

You wouldn't know it to look at him,
but that nice man
who delivers your mail
hits his wife.
You'd never guess by her smile,
but that nice woman
across the street
embezzles from her boss.
And that attractive couple
who jogs by every morning?
They like their cocaine.
The sad truth is,
we don't know our friends
and neighbors
nearly as well as we think we do.
Even the people we love...
Keep secrets.
Need coffee.
This isn't helping you
get your coffee.
Whatever.
It's wakin' me up.
Hey, bud. What are you still doin' home?
I thought you had a morning class.
Actually, I'm thinking
about quitting school.
What?
I thought I might get a job.
Our family's been in
this country five generations.
It's time one of us got a diploma.
What's going on?
Talk to me.
No one talks to me at school,
no one sits near me, everybody
thinks I'm the perv who attacked Julie.
This is a temporary thing.
The police are gonna catch this guy
and everyone will know you are innocent.
But meanwhile, I'm the campus freak.
Do me a favor.
Let's talk about this later.
If you go to school today,
we'll figure something out
when you get home.
Why you being so nice to him?
There is no way we are
lettin' him drop out of school.
I know that,
but we have to be careful here.
You know Danny...
When he gets unhappy, he gets sloppy,
Says all sorts of things
he shouldn't.
So now all we've gotta do is
figure out how to make a teenager happy.
Damn it!
What's the matter?
Nothing fits.
My breasts have gotten huge.
I hate it when that happens.
Every time I'm pregnant...
Second trimester
like clockwork.
Why are you smiling?
Why do you think?
"The supremes" are back.
What did I tell you about naming
them after musical groups?
I know.
It's just that
"Benny And The Jets"
are so happy to see 'em.
This is serious.
I have to hide these things
so Carlos doesn't find out
I'm pregnant.
What am I gonna do with you guys?
I got some ideas.
I got a meeting.
But they're like this
for two weeks until they get all sore,
and you give me
that "don't touch me" look.
Good-Bye, Tom.
Come on. Call in sick.
Kids get snow days.
We could call it a boob day.
It is way too early
for the "don't touch me" look.
So I waited around all morning,
for that repairman that you told
me to call, and he never showed.
No, I'm not done.
I'm sharing my day with you.
Then your children took my $300
perfume and gave their dolls a bath.
Yes, I spent $300 on perfume.
But you're missing the point!
Really?
You don't like it when I yell?
How about this?
I have taken care of your demon spawn
children for 12 hours. My shift is over.
You having fun
working at the restaurant?
I'm having fun working with you.
Look who's here.
I was talking to her.
So, I thought
I was gonna pick you up.
John offered to give me a ride.
I appreciated the company.
Time to go inside.
Someone's got homework.
Night.
You remember homework,
that thing that kids
in high school have to do?
I remember it. I think you used
to help me with mine.
What are you doing with her?
I take care of my employees.
Do you drive the busboys home, too?
I will pick her up from now on.
Come on.
Hey there.
How's she doing?
Much better.
The doctor says the swelling
in her brain has subsided
and she could come to at any moment.
That's terrific.
You should see the flowers
Andrew brought you.
They're gorgeous.
It's the least I could do.
Julie knows how I feel
about her. Don't you, Jules?
I love that you two have
stayed friends all these years.
We lost touch
when she was in med school,
but ever since she quit...
We talk all the time.
She quit?
I thought she told you.
It was six months ago.
She's been out of school
for six months?
You are so lucky
you're in a coma right now.
What has she been doing
all this time?
She didn't know what she
wanted to do with her life, so,
while she was deciding,
she got herself a job, waiting tables.
Did you just say
"waiting tables"?
I thought she...
Told me? No, she didn't.
This is unreal.
Yesterday, I found out
Julie thought she was pregnant.
And now I'm finding out
that my daughter the surgeon
is actually my daughter
the... waitress.
I'm gonna need a moment.
Take your time. I'll just...
Wait!
The guy.
What guy?
Julie was seeing some guy.
You two talk all the time.
What do you know?
It'd be an excellent time
to wake up and help me.
Who is he?
He may be the one that attacked her.
All I know is there was a guy,
but I don't know his name.
Please. Why would she tell you she was
seeing someone and not say who?
Because he's married.
What you got there?
Mints.
Mints?
Mints that are...
"Ribbed for her pleasure"?!
We found a whole box
of them under Ana's bed.
Can I have one before dinner?
No, you can't eat these! These...
aren't mints. They're...
balloons.
Grownup balloons.
Do you and daddy play with them?
If we did, you and I wouldn't
be having this conversation.
Nice knock.
What are these?
Those are condoms.
When a boy and a girl
like each other...
Shut it. Juanita and Celia
found these under your bed.
I want a lock on my door.
I've got news for you.
That is not
where the lock is gonna go.
This is really none of your business.
Sorry.
17 plus condoms?
Totally my business.
What's the story? Are you
sleeping with John Rowland?
Aunt Gaby, he's my boss.
And the oscar goes to...
Not you.
Fine.
But we haven't done anything...
Yet.
"Yet"? Why is there a "Yet"?
I love him.
Did you hear me?
I said I love him.
I heard you.
I was swallowing vomit.
You and John... Not gonna happen.
What is it about John
that gets you so crazy?
He was just your gardener.
I'm not crazy!
And this conversation is over.
I promised the girls
they could fill these of water
and drop them off the roof.
Porter.
Can I talk to you?
Sorry. I've gotta go pick up Penny.
This'll just take a minute.
This friday night,
what do you say you help me
throw Danny a party at our place?
A party?
He needs to make some friends.
He's a little shy, and this
thing with Julie has not helped.
Here's the thing.
Danny and I don't hang out.
We don't have that much in common.
Danny likes money.
Do you like money?
Sure.
See? You do have
something in common.
Are you bribing me?
This is to pay for the party.
And, of course, if there's
a little left over...
And I almost forgot.
You can't have a party without beer.
Is this a trick? Is my mother
hiding to see if I take the bait?
I just want him to have a good time.
So make sure you invite some nice
people, maybe a couple of cute girls.
Anything for my good friend Danny.
All right, how about this one?
It's a lovely 4-Tier cake
with pink fondant.
After showing you 43 cake designs,
I've learned that "hmm" means "no."
But you're getting married in two days,
so unless you wanna shove wedding
jell-O into each other's faces,
you need to make a decision.
I'm sorry.
We just want everything
to be perfect and...
What's this one?
This must be a new design
by my partner Katherine. You like it?
I love it.
Wonderful.
Now...
what flavor do you want?
I would suggest a classic
white cake with raspberry genoise.
Notice anything
different about Lynette?
What are you talking about?
Check her out from
the christmas party.
Before...
After.
Lynette got implants.
Definitely.
And look at those puppies.
Wait a minute. Aren't you gay?
You can't ask me that.
If you're not, I'll punch you in the
face for checking out my married friend.
So gay!
Judy-Liza-Barbra gay!
Proud member since '89!
So for the third quarter,
net income increased by 20%
compared to...
What are you looking at?
Sorry, Lynette. I just...
I know.
You know what?
Your little secret.
You know about the twins?
I have eyes.
First of all, this was not planned.
It wasn't?
Tom and I went out to dinner, he got
me drunk, and the next thing I knew...
So Tom's responsible for all this.
Who else?
You are such a good wife.
I wish you'd talk to Gaby,
get her to jump on the bandwagon.
Doesn't Gaby already have her
hands full with the two she's got?
They're okay. I always
thought we could do better.
What?!
Gaby really looks up to you.
If she knew you got a boob job,
she might consider it.
Boob job?
Sorry. Breast enhancement.
Just give her the name of your doctor.
He did great work.
Got it.
Sure.
By the way, let this be a lesson to you.
Don't try to hide things from me.
I'm a little too sharp for that.
Here.
I just got called on a job.
It's just a busted water main,
So I should be back by...
What happened here?
I came across Julie's journal.
She never says his name.
Whose name?
The married man.
She doesn't use his name.
She just uses the initial..."D."
Why would she use a code
in her own journal?
Because she's afraid
her mom might come across it?
I know that I am
invading her privacy.
Screw it.
This is an emergency.
I bet this D. is
the sick bastard who...
And you know the worst part?
I read this and...
It's like it was written
by a stranger.
Who is this girl?
She dropped out of med school,
she leaves her full scholarship
to wait tables,
and then when she came back, she
started an affair with a married man.
I don't know that Julie.
What is going on with her?
Really?
You can ask her yourself.
She's awake.
How is she? Can I see her?
Just so you know,
she doesn't remember
anything about being attacked.
She's very tired and needs her rest,
so just sit with her.
No questions.
Of course.
I'll just... sit.
It is so good to see you awake.
How are you feeling?
Wait. I forgot.
Doctor said no questions.
So... I'm just gonna sit here
and... look at you.
Thanks.
I'm really tired.
You just sleep, baby.
Just so you know,
you're not pregnant.
What?
Lynette said
you were scared you might be.
But you're not, so...
She shouldn't have told you that.
Now I've upset you.
I'm sorry.
Just ignore me and you sleep.
If you want,
I could tell your boyfriend
that you're better.
My boyfriend?
I knew you
thought that you were pregnant,
and I don't see you going the
turkey baster route, so I assumed
that you had a boyfriend.
I could call him for you.
Unless you think he strangled you
because he's married.
I don't want to talk about this now.
Then we won't.
I'm not even here.
You just rest.
How can I rest when you come
in here with all these questions?
Have I asked you
one single question?
Besides that one?
I think you should go.
Please.
I am your mom.
There is not a thing
that you can't tell me.
I know,
and I'm telling you to go.
I miss you, too.
A peach nightgown. Why?
We are not doing this
on the phone again!
If you can't sleep, take a pill.
Katherine, I'm glad you're here.
We... really need to talk.
If it's about ordering the tents for
the Henderson reunion, already done.
I saw you at Mike and Susan's
last night.
You were spying on me?
I am not the spy in this story.
Okay, you saw me.
Want to know what I saw?
Susan went to bed early
and Mike watched a ball game.
That sound like a marriage to you?
That sounds exactly like a marriage.
All I know is,
it was really nice to watch
a ball game with Mike again.
Through a window!
You are losing your grip here.
Mike loves Susan. He is
not coming back to you.
And if you can't accept that,
then you really need to get some help.
You just cannot stand
to see me happy, can you?
Okay, I realize you're upset...
Because you know
that once I get Mike back, I am gonna
have more in my life than just work.
And I'm not gonna be able
to do your job for you.
Excuse me?
You're never here anymore.
You're always so busy these days.
But you're never too busy to take
bows for the food that I cooked
and I am tired of carrying you!
That's gonna stop right now
because I am putting you
on sick leave for three weeks
effective immediately.
I'm not sick.
Yes, you are.
Now go.
You've got some admirers out there.
As you walked by, I heard one of them
say "Check out the rack on that one."
Can I do the honors and call security?
No, and here's why.
They're the Bertollini brothers.
They've got a $200 million pension fund
they're looking for somebody to run.
Why are you telling this to
"the rack"?
Just listen. We take them to dinner,
they admire the girls up close and
personal, then we close the deal.
And then they leave the money
on the dresser, right?
What, you're mad?
Of course I'm mad.
You can't use my breasts as bait.
Where do you get this attitude?
Come on. You don't buy
Christmas ornaments
unless you're gonna
hang 'em on a tree.
Okay, bad metaphor. My point is,
why would you get those things if
you don't want people looking at them?
I guess...
I wouldn't have.
When do we do this?
Tomorow night.
And if it makes you feel any better,
buy yourself a new dress...
on the company.
A man just gave me a credit
card because of my boobs.
That makes me feel
less like a hooker.
What's up?
If my niece has her way, her skirt.
Excuse me?
You pulled out the old
John Rowland charm
and now Ana has fallen for you.
So she has a little crush.
I think it's sweet.
"Sweet" would be doodling
your name in her notebook.
Ana bought condoms
in what looked like a valu-pack.
I had no idea she was that serious.
I mean, I was only flirting with her...
a little.
Well, she's 17,
so you're also flirting
with an orange jumpsuit.
You're pretty worked up about this.
You should be, too.
If you lay one finger on Ana, Carlos
will knock every tooth out of your mouth
which will make you pretty
darn popular in prison.
I'm not really into Ana.
Okay, I was flirting with her
to see if you still cared.
And obviously, you do.
No, I don't.
Really?
If you weren't jealous, then why'd you
forbid me to drive Ana home?
Because I remember what
you could accomplish in a parked car.
I think about those days a lot.
I was just a kid.
I had to mow lawns for a living,
and I couldn't offer you
anything but... but sex.
But now
I can offer you so much more.
What are you talking about?
I have a lot of money now, Gaby.
And you're stuck in a house with
two kids and a husband who's never home.
And when I saw you again, with
macaroni and cheese on your T-shirt
I said to myself,
"what a shame. This gorgeous woman
should be sipping champagne
on a yacht."
So... what, you're gonna rescue me?
Tell me you're not unhappy.
I'm not.
Why don't I believe you?
Ana, wait!
He isn't home yet.
Ana, we have to talk.
You knew that I liked him.
How could you do this?
Okay, what you saw wasn't
what you thought it was.
Did you slip, and your tongue
accidentally fell into John's mouth?
I didn't kiss John! John kissed me!
And no tongues were involved!
Yeah, well, you have
your version. I have mine.
We'll see which one
uncle Carlos believes.
Okay, Ana, I'm gonna
tell you something.
Ten years ago,
John Rowland and I...
had an affair.
Your uncle Carlos knows about it.
A lot of people got hurt.
But we survived it.
I have no more feelings for John.
But today I found out
he still has feelings for me.
I saw you staring
at this the other day.
I didn't understand it then.
Now I do.
I was staring at a memory. Yes.
And sometimes when I'm
having a rough day,
I think about what might have been.
But trust me, I would never go back.
Look, Ana, I love your uncle Carlos,
and we have a wonderful life together.
Please, do not do anything
that's gonna hurt him.
Finally got home early.
So what's new?
I was just telling aunt Gaby...
that I wanna quit my job.
Anyway, I have homework.
I found this on my bed.
You like it?
What's the occasion?
The party. I want you to look good.
You didn't have to do that.
Why not? I wanted to buy
something nice for my son.
Besides, it made me feel less guilty
about buying this...
for me. Cute, huh?
Wait till you see it on me.
Are you ever gonna get
that thing taken care of?
What, the scar?
I don't even see it anymore.
They can get rid of those things
these days, mom.
Yeah, but that costs money.
So?
We have to be careful
about money. You know that.
I don't see dad being careful.
He bought a new set of golf clubs.
Listen to me.
After the explosion,
I was in bad shape.
You father took
real good care of me.
He hung in there.
He's a good man.
Don't you forget that.
One day, I'm gonna make
= a lot of money,
and we're gonna get that scar fixed.
Honey.
And don't worry. Whatever happens,
I'm gonna take care of you.
Check out the dress. It's fantastic.
What'd it cost?
My dignity.
Worth every penny.
Aren't you going to check your jacket?
Well, it's a little chilly in here.
It's not chilly.
And even if it was, that's more
of a reason to lose the jacket.
Come on. It's just for one night.
Fine.
I will check this for you.
Go meet the guys.
And there he is now.
I was just telling these guys...
Could I talk to you for a sec, dad?
What are you doing?
What, I can't talk to people?
A lot of people are here but
you pick a couple 20-year-old girls?
Come on. I'm saying hello
to a couple of your friends.
Yeah, well, don't.
I've been gettin' this vibe
from you for a while now,
and I don't think I deserve it.
I think you do.
You do? Why is that?
Because I know.
You know what, son?
Jeez, Nick! What the hell?!
What do you gotta crash
every party in the world?
I bet you want him the hell out of here.
I'm on it. Have fun, baby. Come on.
Hi, sweetheart.
Hooker's home.
How did it go?
It was...
bizarre.
From the moment I walked in
with the girls here,
I got smiles,
winks. Men pulled out my chair.
The busboy filled my water glass
every two minutes.
And the Bertollini brothers,
who seem to think our proposal
was written on my cleavage,
were putty in my hands.
They signed the deal on the spot!
That's great!
Congratulations.
So why are men so obsessed
with these things?
I don't know what to say, honey.
I mean, some guys...
are just breast men.
"Some guys," huh?
Me? I appreciate all
aspects of the female...
I'm up here, Tom.
Come on.
Come on, I've seen pictures of
your old girlfriends. Just admit it.
Okay. My name it Tom Scavo,
and I like big breasts.
But you married me.
Man, I stepped right
into that one, didn't I?
So let me ask you. You ever
feel like you compromised?
Okay, I'm giving you
one chance to start over.
I need you to not be perfect.
Why?
Because I'm not perfect.
I'm not... rich.
I'm not brilliant.
I'm not movie star handsome.
If you didn't have this one flaw,
I would spend
every moment of every day
wondering,
what the heck is she doing with me?
You may not be brilliant,
but you can tiptoe through a minefield
better than anyone I know.
Well done.
I tried to wait up,
but today was just too much.
What happened?
Well, the repairman
finally showed up, but
he didn't have the
right part so he left again.
Then Celia hid my car keys
so I couldn't take her to the dentist.
Then she forgot where she put them.
I told them both they'd be sorry
when their father got home,
except you didn't... until now.
I'm sorry, Gaby.
It's okay.
It's kind of funny
when you think about it.
What?
My life.
It just seems so small sometimes.
I spend my days thinking about
detergent...
and groceries...
or how I'm gonna get the spot
out of the upholstery.
It's not at all the life
I thought I'd choose for myself.
But some days,
I look up,
and I realize I'm happy.
I'm honest to God
happy with my life.
Anyway, I just thought
you might like to know that.
Can I help you with that?
You're supposed to be on sick leave.
I'm better. Really.
Now what can I do?
I don't want to fight.
Neither do I. I've lost
so much these past few weeks.
My job and your friendship, it's...
it's all I have left
and I can't lose those.
Honey.
So...
are we friends again?
Of course.
I've just been worried
about you, that's all.
But if you say you're better,
then... I believe you.
Good, because I really, really am.
What the hell is that?
That's the cake.
No, that's my cake.
Yes. The bride saw your
design and just loved it.
No, it's my cake...
the one I designed for my wedding...
mine and Mike's.
Well, aren't you glad we
found a good use for it?
I watched another bride
marry my fianc.
I am not going to watch
another bride eat my cake.
Well, no one says
you have to watch, dear.
I know you're upset but don't you dare
take it out on that cake!
It's mine. And if I can't have it,
nobody will.
Don't you touch that cake!
Somebody help!
Stop that woman!
It's mine!
... to be my lawfully wedded
wife and one true love.
I promise to cherish,
honor and protect you,
and to love you more each day
than I did the day before.
You may now kiss the bride.
Good to see you out of bed.
I'm sorry about yesterday.
So... have you remembered
anything else about the attack?
Nothing.
You know, everybody wants
to see the guy who did this
off the streets, but the police
don't have much to go on. So...
if they could talk to this...
man that you were seeing...
Maybe they could
cross him off the list.
He didn't do it.
And I'm not seeing him anymore,
okay?
I broke it off.
You broke it off?
Well, that's a motive right there.
At least let them question him.
If he's innocent,
he has nothing to lose.
Except for his family
when they find out.
So now you're concerned
about his family.
What did you say?
You heard me.
For God sake, what were you
thinking, dating a married man?
Don't do this.
I am your mother. I love you.
I have spent
the last five days sitting there,
not sleeping, not eating.
Don't shut me out.
I was lonely.
Okay?
He was nice.
It just happened.
I don't see how.
This is not something you would do.
Well, guess what?
I'm not perfect anymore.
That perfect daughter you remember
who was always there
when you needed her,
who held everything together
when you were falling apart?
She's grown up, and she's
going to make mistakes.
You wanna make mistakes? Fine.
Dye your hair,
drop out of school. I don't care.
I never expected you to be perfect,
but I didn't raise you
to do something this stupid.
You know what
an affair like this can do.
You saw it firsthand.
Morning.
Where do you think you're going?
To the test kitchen. We need to start
prep on the Berman bar mitzvah.
Yesterday, you nearly destroyed
my company's reputation.
Today you're worried about prep work?
I don't want to talk about yesterday.
It won't happen again.
That's right, because you're fired.
I'm sorry, but I see no other way
to get you realize how serious this is.
You have got to give up this obsession
with Mike before it ruins your life.
I need to work. It's all
that's keeping me going.
You need help, counseling.
I'm telling you this as your friend.
You are not my friend.
Yes, I am.
That's why I'm taking
such a firm hand.
Your only job now is to get better.
I'm gonna need you
to give me your keys.
There you go.
A souvenir of our... friendship.
You wouldn't know it to look at her,
but the lady next door
is having a nervous breakdown.
You'd never guess by her smile,
but the wife of your uncle
once betrayed his trust.
And that daughter you adore...
well, she's having an affair
with a married man.
The sad truth is,
we don't know
our friends and neighbors
nearly as well as we think we do.
Even the people we trust most...
keep secrets.
It's Dominic.
I miss you.
Previously
on Depserate Housewives...
I booked our room at the motel...
I don't want to be alone tonight.
Neither do I.
Affairs got serious...
If you got hit by a bus,
I'd really miss you.
You're showering alone tonight.
I love you. There. I said it.
An ex-lover...
What are you doing?
Letting you know I'm here.
Let's just say he was grateful...
very grateful.
Spun out of control.
You're fired.
And when a crime was committed...
A neighbor was suspected.
Everybody thinks I'm the perv
who attacked Julie.
Just in case someone should try
hurt you, do you know
where your we keep the gun?
But it was the victim,
What were you thinking,
dating a married man?
Who had secrets.
I miss you.
It is in our nature to judge
the people around us.
We judge the way strangers dress.
The way our neighbors
tend their lawns...
And the way our
friends act in public.
Yes, we make these judgments
all the time,
never thinking that one day
we may be judged...
ourselves.
Girls, what are you doing?
For Pete's sake.
My arm.
What did I tell you about
sliding down the staircase?
Not to use the good suitcase?
Besides that. Don't do it at all!
What are we supposed to do?
You won't let us play
on the roof anymore.
What happened?
Don't worry. She's okay.
These two knuckleheads decided
to slide down the staircase.
Why would you let them do that?
Don't blame me.
I wasn't envn in the room.
You left the girls unsupervised?
They were playing.
I can't watch 'em every second.
Why not?
I look after Juanita
when she's at my house
and she goes home without a scratch.
Only 'cause she's indestructible.
Honey, do that thing
where you run into the wall.
Watch. This is hilarious.
You're pretty cavalier considering your
carelessness almost killed my daughter.
I gotta say, Laura,
you're kind of a wet blanket
since you quit smoking.
Why don't you try a pipe?
And I've got to say, Gaby,
I think you're a lousy mother.
Did you just say that to my face?
Yes, and I'm afraid I won't be bringing
my daughter here anymore.
The safety and well-being
of my child must come first.
Fine. Juanita only had Rachel over
because she felt sorry for her.
It was a pity playdate.
And of course this means Rachel won't
be attending Juanita's birthday party.
More cake for us!
Beat it!
Let's go, sweetie.
Yes, it's in our nature
to judge those around us.
It's also in our nature...
If you had taught your kid
how to tuck and roll on impact,
we wouldn't even be having
this conversation!
To blame someone else
for our mistakes.

It had been two weeks
since Julie Mayer
had been attacked.
And when she came home
from the hospital,
the residents of Wisteria Lane
were there
to welcome her back.
She was greeted by children
who came with signs...
housewives who came with desserts...
and old friends
who came with flowers.
Also in the crowd
was a new friend...
who came with an agenda.
I'm so glad you guys came.
See you later.
Welcome home.
I've been so worried about you.
Is there someplace we can talk?
We're not doing this anymore.
Please.
I'm sorry.
It's over.
I am so sorry I'm late.
I have three parties this weekend
and I'm up to my elbows in canaps.
Why isn't Katherine helping you?
I had to let her go.
What?
You're kidding.
We were working and she went berserk.
And then when I fired her,
she intentionally scratched my car.
I flipped her the bird
the other day after she cut me off.
Won't make that mistake again.
I think she needs help.
I think she's a drama queen.
But if she is in trouble,
and we don't do anything,
it could be
Mary Alice all over again.
I don't know.
Susan, what do you think?
She's going through a rough time,
but I have trouble
feeling sorry for her.
I get that, after that stunt
at your wedding.
True. And did you tell them about
Katherine hitting on Mike?
What?
When did that happen?
He did mention it, didn't he?
Of course.
We laugh about it all the time.
And look. There's Mike now and...
I could use a good laugh.
Would you excuse me?
Sweetie, can I talk to you a second?
If it was no big deal,
why didn't you just tell me?
Julie was in the hospital.
I didn't tell you because I,
crazy me,
thought it might upset you.
And here's why I'm upset...
'cause now I realize
that Katherine is not hurting.
She's plotting.
So I'm gonna go over there...
You do not pour gasoline on this fire.
You're right. I wanna
pour gasoline on Katherine.
And if you love me,
you'll give me a match and an alibi.
Let her have her lies. Let her plot.
You got nothing to worry about.
You mean everything to me
and Katherine means nothing.
That's sweet.
I'm gonna go tell her you said that.
Get back here.
Wanna talk about it?
Sure. Let's have a nice father/son
chat about how you're cheatin' on mom.
Do you know how stupid I felt?
I got into a huge fight with Julie
'cause I thought she was lying to me,
that she was just telling me she
had a boyfriend to blow me off.
And I followed her home and...
it turns out
she does have a boyfriend,
you.
I'm sorry.
And for what it's worth,
it's over.
If I ever see
you two together again...
I'm gonna tell mom.
You wanna tell your mother?
Come on.
Let's go right now. Come on.
What?
You think you can dangle
that ax over my head?
Then go for it.
So you want mom to know?
You want to destroy her life?
Your mom finding out that I had
an affair won't destroy her.
Her finding out that you knew
about it? That will.
I'm the bad guy.
You think your mom's
the perfect one in this marriage?
There you two are.
They're bringing out a cake for Julie.
Everything okay out here?
Just having
a little father/son chat.
That's my boys.
Come on.
They're cuttin' the cake.
Come in!
When you've needed a favor,
have I ever let you down?
Last month we needed a sitter for Penny
but you didn't want to miss Oktoberfest.
And just last Thursday...
New way in.
I got a problem with Roy.
He's been kinda down lately.
What's wrong?
He lives on a fixed income and
he can't afford to pay for nice dinners.
But when I pay, he sulks.
He says I'm keeping him.
At his age, he should be glad
to have something keeping him
besides formaldehyde.
You know what I mean?
And the favor would be?
I was thinking maybe
you and Tom could hire him
for a few hours
a week as a handyman.
So he'd have
a little walking around money.
I don't know.
Girl talk time.
When Roy's spirits are drooping,
the problem is global.
You get the picture?
Getting the picture isn't the problem.
It's getting rid of it.
Come on. Try him for one week.
I'm only hesitant
because he's your boyfriend
and I'd hate to risk
straining a good friendship.
If I were that good a friend, would I
be putting you in this awkward position?
Excellent point.
He's hired.
Thanks.
You'll never know
what you've done for my sex life.
Good.
I love it that you do that.
What?
When I first brought you here, you
didn't want to set foot in this room.
And now you get sad
every time we have to leave.
It's now our place.
It's not what I would've chosen
but it's growing on me.
I'm sorry.
I thought you checked out.
It's okay. We're just going.
Tip's on the dresser.
Thank you, sir.
Excuse me.
I seem to have lost
an earring... a little pearl stud.
I can help you look for it.
Thank you.
No, I told you your gray suit
is at the tailor's.
Where am I now?
At the supermarket
getting us something for dinner.
You already did all the shopping?
Great.
I will just put all this food away
and come straight home.
Found it.
It was buried in the sheets.
Thank you very much.
Let me get you a little something.
My wallet's here somewhere.
That's all right.
I'm sure you're eager
to get home to your husband
Thanks for letting me know.
What's wrong?
Heidi Bremer just informed me
her kid can't come on Saturday.
She and Don are going to
the nursing home to visit his mother.
So why are you mad?
Because it's a lie! Heidi hates her!
She wouldn't cross the street
to visit that drooling fossil.
And that's the third cancellation,
and every excuse has been a crock.
Why would people lie
to get out of a kid's party?
Because Laura Miller's
out there spreading her poison.
She's telling every woman in the P.T.A.
their kids aren't safe in my house.
Those hausfrau cronies of hers
are lapping it up.
Juanita will be heartbroken
if no one comes to her party.
They'll come.
We just have to build it, that's all.
This is about to cost me money,
isn't it?
There are women
who think I'm a bad mother.
It is your job to support me. Now
just shut up and fork over some cash.
Wouldn't it be easier to just
watch the kids while they play?
Did you just say that to my face?
Here.
Take the whole wallet.
Voil. Grilled langoustine.
Your favorite.
How very thoughtful of you.
They weren't easy to find.
The man at one store
tried to sell me shrimp.
And when I tried to explain
the difference, he gave me an argument.
What is it with service people
these days?
They used to be polite
and deferential.
Now they just sneer
right in your face.
It's intolerable.
I wouldn't let it spoil
a nice dinner.
Sorry, I had a very irksome
encounter myself today.
Really? Where?
At a... caf.
I was having lunch,
and this waitress was
rude and superior.
Superior? To you?
You should've whipped out
a copy of your best-selling cookbook,
like you did last week
in the food court at the mall.
I doubt this woman
would've been impressed.
Really? You sure put
that pretzel vendor in his place.
I was so startled, I didn't know
what to say. I just...
let it go.
Is this a caf you frequent often?
As often as I can.
Next time you're in there,
I think you should clear the air.
Demand a little courtesy.
Thank you, Orson.
I think I may do that tomorrow.
This is nice, isn't it?
Sharing a meal,
talking about our days.
Why don't you pass
on that caf tomorrow
and let me make you
a nice salad or an omelet?
Thank you, dear,
but tomorrow I'm planning
on having something a bit spicier.
Look what Roy did.
Open. Closed. Open! Closed!
We don't need to use
that spatula anymore!
That's great!
Since you're so ingenious,
how about you build some flower boxes
for our bedroom windows?
Our window if you want
but not the kids'.
Why not?
Cause they'll never water 'em.
I'll remind 'em.
They can't keep a goldfish alive
for more than one day.
What makes you think they're
gonna take better care of geraniums?
I don't know. I just know
we're getting flower boxes.
You could go ahead
and get those started.
Are you good with this, Mr. Scavo?
Sure. What the hell.
I'll go measure the windows.
Thanks, Roy.
What was that?
What?
He just went over my head to you.
I knew I liked that guy
the minute he walked in.
Look!
Open. Closed. Open! Closed!
I'm glad you're here, Laura.
I wanted to apologize.
Things got a little heated and we both
said some things we didn't mean.
I appreciate that, Gabrielle.
Good.
Now that that's behind us,
if Rachel would like to come
to Juanita's birthday party,
we'd love to have her.
Sorry, but I'm still not
comfortable with that.
That's a shame.
We're gonna have
face painting and...
a cotton candy machine...
and a clown.
A clown?! Where's a clown?!
Not here, sweetie.
He'll be at Juanita's
birthday party on saturday...
the one your mommy
won't let you go to.
I wanna go!
Rachel, we'll talk about it later.
What are you doing?
I'm sorry. She asked me a question.
I just answered it.
For example, if she were to ask me
if we were having a bouncy house,
I'd have to say, "just the biggest
bouncy house you've ever seen!"
A bouncy house!
I love bouncy houses!
Is the clown gonna
be in the bouncy house?
Maybe, but you'll never know.
Please.
You're right. I'm sorry.
This is cruel.
Come on, Juanita.
We gotta buy bananas.
The people at your party are gonna
want something to feed the monkey.
A monkey?!
Mommy!
We'll talk about it later.
Excuse me?
Did you need something in your room?
I'm not checked in.
I came here to see you.
I don't have any weed, lady.
Sorry?
All you ladies with the nice cars
thinks anyone who talks like this
must have ganja to sell.
I am not here to buy ganja.
I came about yesterday.
I appreciated you finding my earring,
but I didn't care for your attitude.
It was very insulting.
Did I say one cross word to you?
You didn't need to.
Your disdain was perfectly clear
from the look you gave me.
And there is it again.
I have 12 rooms to do.
I don't have time to argue.
Fine. Then I'll help.
Lady, please.
I won't look at you no more, okay?
I'm just saying you shouldn't make
snap judgments about people.
You see I'm having an affair,
And you just assume I'm a bad person...
And a dope fiend.
If you knew more about my marriage,
you'd see me very differently.
I don't need to know
about your marriage.
If you're going to form opinions
about it, then yes, you do.
My husband is a controlling ex-con.
I've begged him for a divorce
but he won't let me go.
I'm practically his prisoner.
Your husband's a good man.
You know nothing about him.
I know he does your shopping
for you.
When you lied to him on the phone,
told him you were at the grocery store.
He said he already went.
And your point is?
You know what I would give
to have a man do my shopping for me,
make my life a little bit easier?
And you're not even grateful.
You're just sneaking off here
to do the nasty with your boyfriend.
Who are you to judge me?
You can't even make hospital corners!
What do you want me to say?
That cheating's not a sin
when you do it in pearls?
Unless you want to start on
the toilet,
I think we're done.
These flower boxes
are really coming along.
If you have a moment...
no rush...
would you hang this birdhouse
for me?
I was thinking on that big tree.
You got it.
Thanks.
Over there. That tree.
I was talking to Tom
about it this morning
and, he wants it over here.
Well, that's probably because
he forgot the sprinklers go off
over there. So...
do me a favor
and hang it in that tree.
Thank you.
... cause she's telling me she wants it
on the other side of the yard.
Gotta go.
Boy, you're everywhere.
We should get you a bell.
Why you calling Tom?
To make sure he's okay with
where you wanna hang this thing.
I mean, he is the man of the house.
Okay, I know,
since you're using a cell phone,
you know what century it is,
but just to clarify...
you don't have to
keep checking with Tom.
I make plenty of decisions
around here.
I noticed.
I just prefer to treat the guy
with a little respect.
Excuse me?
Just cause you like crunching
his walnuts doesn't mean I do.
I beg your pardon!
His walnuts are completely intact!
And you know what? I think
we are done here. You can go.
Fine. Soon as I hang this birdhouse.
And he said he doesn't care
where it is, so you win... again.
This isn't about winning!
And I just fired you,
so you can go home.
I promised Tom I'd do this
and I'm doing it.
I'd clean that up,
but you just fired me.
Oh, my gosh! I'm so sorry.
I thought you saw me.
No. It's okay.
I was... just...
Yeah, I shoulda realized.
I'm sorry.
I guess you heard
that after it happened,
some people thought that...
I know it wasn't you, Danny.
That night we argued,
you said you were seeing a guy.
You think maybe he had
something to do with it?
I thought about it,
but no.
He's not that kind of guy.
So you have no idea?
I wish I did.
I haven't been able to sleep.
Every time I'm about
to close my eyes,
I'm afraid he'll be there
when I wake up.
You know what?
I think I might
have something to help.
Thank you, all, for volunteering.
Here's the thing. Whoever
attacked Julie is still out there, so,
it's up to us to look out
for each other which is where
the neighbor watch comes in.
Susan's gonna talk to you
about patrol duty.
What is she patrolling for?
His tonsils?
We still need people for
9:00 to midnight on thursday.
Any volunteers?
"Project runway."
We have Mona Clarke...
and Irma Pritchet.
No one else?
Okay, meeting adjourned.
There's coffee back in the kitchen.
Mrs. Pritchet's got
a clogged shower drain,
and I promised I'd fix it for her.
I don't think she saw that one.
You wanna do it again?
I'll see you at home.
A word?
Did you not see my hand up?
I was trying to volunteer.
I saw.
I was just trying to pick the people
who I thought could best
protect our neighborhood.
So you picked Irma Pritchet?
Her son is in a nursing home.
Irma is old
but she's not a big fat liar.
Excuse me?
Well, are younot going around
saying that my husband hit on you?
I know you're under
a terrible strain, but...
do you really think
it's a good idea to air...
your dirty laundry
in front of all these people?
You're the one with dirty laundry.
My laundry is clean,
folded and put away, you loon.
Girls? Everything all right here?
It's not.
First she calls me a liar,
and now I'm a loon.
You all heard the things she was saying.
You saw the way she acted at my wedding.
Not everyone was invited
to your wedding.
Jeez, Mona. You're like a dog
with a bone. Let it go.
I understand why you're upset.
I'd be on edge, too,
if my marriage were having problems.
Okay, Mike and I are
perfectly happy,
and the only problem we have is you.
So stay out of our lives,
or you'll be sorry.
If you two are so happy. Then
where did he just disappear to?
He's snaking a lady's drain, okay?
And, yes,
I realize how that sounded.
Get your minds ut of the gutter.
Have fun.
Coco the clown will make you
any balloon animal you want.
You know, maybe I should
stay for a little while.
Come on. I'm watching them.
I've got everything under control.
Will you be here?
Could you believe her?
I'm a good mom, aren't I?
People trust me.
I brought my kid, didn't I?
You did.
But wait. You're staying.
I'll get us drinks.
Hi, sweetie. What's the matter?
Aren't you having a good time?
The man is putting the monkey away.
He said he was too tired
to play anymore.
I don't think so.
That ape is on the clock till 4:00.
What gives?
Sorry. Mr. Fibbs did two shows
yesterday. He needs a nap.
No way. I paid for two hours of monkey.
I want two hours of monkey.
Let him go.
I can do the gig alone.
No offense, Coco, but I need this
to be the greatest party ever,
and your act isn't exactly
zingin' the kids.
I killed at your other kid's party.
Those kids were 3!
These are 7-year-olds! The big time!
Crappy balloon animals ain't
gonna cut it! We need the monkey!
Lady, he's tired.
Well, then give him some
bana-flavored coffee.
You screw me on this and I swear,
Fibbs will never work
in this town again.
Come in.
You called for a lightbulb?
The bedside lamp.
I saw you pull in an hour ago.
Your gentleman friend stand you up?
Sorry to disappoint you
but he just called. He's on his way.
That's nice.
Well, if you finish your magazine,
there's a bible in the nightstand.
Tell me something.
Did he cheat on you just once
or did he do it all the time?
Who?
I've been wondering
what makes a woman
so quick to judge anyone
who has an affair,
and I think I know.
Your husband cheated on you,
didn't he?
My husband...
was the best man that I ever knew.
But a good man
wasn't good enough for me.
I was like you.
I wanted fun, excitement,
so I found myself a boyfriend.
Good-looking guy. Sexy.
And we had ourselves a real good time.
You having a good time, lady?
Yes, I am.
Enjoy it while it lasts.
It didn't last long for me.
And when it was done,
I had no husband
and no boyfriend.
So now I'm cleaning rooms.
Every day, I see women in here
acting just as stupid as I was.
I don't say a word to them.
I just give them a look.
Well, I'm...
sorry your affair ended so badly.
But that doesn't mean
that mine will.
You seem like a nice lady.
Don't you ever feel guilty?
Yes, all right?
Yes, I feel guilty all the time.
You don't know what it's like
when I come home,
and my husband's at the door
and there's such love
in his eyes, such...
hope.
And I wanna shake him
and say, "stop it.
Stop loving me.
I'm not worth it anymore."
Don't you want to be worth it again?
Hi, honey, I'm so sorry.
Is there some kind of problem?
No, sir.
Just turning on a light.
There you are.
Now it's a kids' party.
You still mad about Laura?
The party's a success.
The kids are having a great time.
We're drinkin' margaritas.
What's not to likey?
You know what?
You're right. I won.
Laura and her stuck-ip posse thought
her kids weren't safe in my house.
I've shown them the best time
they're gonna have all year.
I know. They're loud.
Kids! Adults talking!
No, I think that there's a problem.
What's goin' on?
The monkey's killing the clown!
I've gotta get my tranquilizer gun.
I told you he need a nap!
He was already on edge,
and then that damn clown
popped a balloon in his face!
Laura, I was here every minute!
It's not my fault they sent us
a homicidal monkey!
The important part
is the kids had a good time
and created lifelong memories.
You forgot your goody bag!
So I still don't get
why you fired Roy.
I mean, he was putting the birdhouse
where you wanted it, right?
It's not about that.
He said I emasculate you.
He said that?
Well, not in those words.
He went with a more colorful
nutcracking analogy.
He is funny.
He is not funny!
And this would be a really good place
for you to jump in and tell me I'm not
a castrating bitch.
Sure.
Just put down the knife first.
We are not laughing
at this at all, huh?
Come on, babe.
We're great. You know that.
What do you care what he thinks?
I don't care. It's just...
it bugs me that he's judging me.
What are you doing with that?
I thought I'd barbecue some chicken.
It's almost dinnertime,
and that's still frozen.
Just get some burgers
from the garage.
You got it.
Can I talk to you?
Sure thing, pally.
Here. Take a load off.
If it's about me getting into it
with your wife, though,
I have to stop you first
and say I'm sorry.
Well, thanks.
I mean, I know times have changed,
but a man's still a man,
and you deserve
to have your wife respect you.
She respects me plenty, Roy.
Here's the thing
you gotta understand about Lynette.
She grew up without her dad.
Her mom was a drinker.
So she had to be responsible
for everyone.
Well, that's rough.
It left her with this constant
fear that everything
could suddenly fall apart.
And that's why she needs
to control everything.
Of course, she can't.
Nobody can.
But...
she can control me...
if I let her.
So I do...
because it makes her feel safe.
And that is my job
as her husband...
to make her feel safe.
You're a good man, Scavo.
I try.
Now...
if you'll excuse me,
I have hamburger to fetch.
Stop beating yourself up.
It wasn't that bad.
Carlos, a monkey
almost killed a clown.
That is the definition
of a bad children's party.
Laura's right.
I'm a terrible mom.
Come here.
Look...
I am no expert at raising children.
All I know is,
when all those other kids
ran screaming to their moms,
Juanita jumped in the bouncy house and
zipped it up and Celia played dead.
Those girls are smart.
They were quick
on their feet, weren't they?
Which they wouldn't be if you'd been
hovering all over 'em their whole lives.
They have learned to be
independent and resourceful,
and that is thanks
to your negligence.
So sweet.
That better not be
the good suitcase!
Sweetie?
Get mike!
He's on a job. What's going on?
Somebody is outside.
Oh, my God.
What is that?!
It's a gun.
Where did you get that?!
Give that to me.
What are you thinking?
It's loaded, right?
I have a gun!
I've called the police!
They'll be here any minute!
You shot me!
The gun just went off!
Are you all right?
You tried to kill me!
I just shot you. Let's not be
throwing accusations around.
It looks like it just grazed your
shoulder. There's hardly any blood.
What happened?
Susan shot me! Call the police!
I told you she was gonna snap.
It's always the pretty ones.
It was an accident.
I want you to be my lawyer.
I call Bob as my lawyer.
We heard a gun go off.
Susan shot me!
I didn't know it was her.
What were you doing
sneaking around my house?
I was on neighborhood watch!
You didn't have an assigned shift.
Tom Scavo had to study.
He asked me to fill in!
Well... you should've checked with me.
That's what I was trying to do
when you shot me!
All right. Everybody, just calm down.
I'm gonna go call an ambulance.
Perhaps we should unload this
before someone else gets hurt.
Susan just shot Katherine Mayfair.
What?
She's okay,
but she's... freaked out.
I never pegged Susan as a gun owner.
Crap.
It's our gun. I gave it to Julie.
What? Why?
She was sacred.
She wanted protection.
That gun is under our real name!
If they trace that back to us...
We are not going to let that happen.
You're going to jail for this.
Everyone heard you
threaten me at that meeting.
I have witnesses.
Please.
If I were gonna kill you, I wouldn't
do it in my own front yard.
I'd sneak into your house and
shoot you while you were asleep.
Not that I would ever do that.
Katherine, where are you going?
Home, to call the police.
The ambulance is on its way.
But I brought a first aid kit.
Why don't you let me clean
you up and then you can call?
Just leave it!
Hand me the phone.
I wanna call the police.
Dumb move.
What?
Listen to me.
You and Mike...
I see it, too.
Those looks he gives you?
He's still crazy about you.
I know!
So... use your head.
You wanna call the police and have the
mother of his kid carted off to jail?
Don't be stupid.
High road all the way.
That's a good point.
And besides,
you walk around with a bandage
on your shoulder for a few days...
she looks like a monster
and you come off
looking like a saint.
So how we doin' here?
I'm fine!
I don't think we'll be needing
that ambulance anymore.
So am I going to jail?
She's not calling anybody.
She's a little worked up
but we talked.
It's gonna be okay.
It is in our nature
to judge the people around us.
If they ignore our wishes,
we believe they are disrespectful.
If they don't watch their children,
we conclude they are unfit parents.
If we catch them cheating,
we assume we know their reasons.
But what happens
when we finally stop for a moment
to judge our own lives?
It can be painful to step back
and see what we've been doing...
and even more painful to realize
we have no intention
of stopping.
Previously
on Desperate Housewives...
You're a lousy mother.
Gaby was insulted.
Did you just say that to my face?
I closed the door to ask
if you'd like to be my new senior VP.
Lynette chose not to
mention her pregnancy.
You get to stay in school.
Susan tried to protect Julie.
You shot me!
That gun is under our real name.
I wanna call the police.
And Angie had to protect her secret.
High road all the way.
That's a good point.
Bree Hodge had a problem.
She did not want to fall
in love with Karl Mayer.
She was appalled
by his table manners...
What?
His personal ethics...
What?
And his wandering eye.
What?
No, Bree did not want to fall
for Karl Mayer,
but she knew in her heart
that she was starting to.
And that's why she also knew
the time had come...
We have to talk.
... to leave.
What's with the face?
You dumping me?
You are dumping me.
We've both known
this couldn't last forever so let's
end it before someone gets hurt.
But it's going so well.
I feel we're getting closer.
We are.
That's the problem.
When I agreed to be your lover,
I felt quite sure
that my disdain for your vulgarity
and astounding lack of scruples
would preclude any chance of
my developing feelings for you.
But against all reason,
it's happening.
I don't want to fall in love
with a man I'm not even sure I like.
I'm glad we're being careful
about no one getting hurt.
Please,
let's not make this
any harder than it has to be.
You say we're done, we're done.
I was gonna wait
to give you this later,
maybe over dinner or something.
I guess now it's sort of
a parting gift.
I couldn't.
Open it.
It's beautiful!
And it's inscribed.
"To my dear
and beloved... Irene"?
Irene was my grandmother.
My grandpa gave it to her on
their first anniversary.
She had no granddaughters,
so she willed it to me.
She said, "Someday,
you'll find the perfect woman
to give this to," and she was right.
I know how you feel.
I didn't plan
on falling for you, either.
And I don't blame you for
wanting to run the other way.
And for what it's worth...
I love you.
And in that moment,
Bree knew that the time
to leave her lover had come...
and gone.

Ann Peterson
was the principal
of Fairview elementary school,
and she believed in rules.
She used them to teach hygiene,
to control behavior
and to instill order.
Yes,
Mrs. Peterson believed in rules.
She also believed
that those who didn't follow them
should be punished.
The camera is rolling.
Any words you'd like to say before
your daughter makes her stage debut?
Let us pray.
Juanita is going to see this.
Trust me, this is not footage
you're gonna wanna keep.
I'm sorry.
I tried to work with her.
But you may as well know
your daughter is talent-free.
She is only 7.
How bad could she be?
I've already looked the program to
pick out a kid we can pretend is ours.
I like Paige Glover.
I'm gonna be her mommy.
My name is Miles Standish.
We have come to share with you
our bounty.
And to give thanks
for this new land,
where we are free
from religious perskacootion.
Which one is Paige Glover?
Religious perspacotion.
Where we are free from religious...
Persecution!
Read the corn! I wrote it on the corn!
At that moment, Juanita Solis
chose to utter
a certain 4-letter word...
for the very first time.
I did not write that on the corn.
Just promise me you won't have
a few drinks and get all kissy with me
like you
did last week at the Bermans'.
You don't want our friends to know
we're having marital problems.
you don't have to maul me
to prove we're okay.
I don't like
public displays of affection.
I know. But these days, they're
the only kind I can get from you.
Sorry we're late, Mike.
That's okay, come on in.
Oh, my God.
I can't believe it.
It's just a pie, Susan.
I've brought them before.
No, the brooch that you're wearing.
It's mine.
Excuse me?
Karl gave it to me years ago.
Can I see it?
I don't doubt that it's similar,
but it can't possibly be the same one.
There's the inscription.
To his granny Irene!
This is the same brooch
I lost ten years ago.
You say you lost it?
it was back when
Karl and I got divorced.
one day it was on my coat,
and the next... gone.
I never knew where it went.
Hi, everybody.
Now we know.
Great to see you.
See you, sweetheart.
Get in here. Wait.
You are not gonna believe this.
Bree found
your grandmother's brooch.
What?
Yes,
the one that Susan lost.
What an extraordinary coincidence.
Where did you get it, Bree?
She bought it. I'm assuming.
Yes, at that little antique store
down on Pearl Street.
Obviously, whoever found
it must've sold it to that store.
Remember how mad you got
when I lost it?
He really yelled at me.
You yelled at her?
I don't recall yelling.
You kinda did.
"How could you lose
my grandmother's brooch?!
It was a family heirloom!"
Unbelievable.
That it would turn up
again after all this time.
I'm glad I can give it
back to its rightful owner.
It's yours.
You bought it.
I couldn't possibly wear
it knowing that Karl gave it to you.
How much did it cost?
I'll reimburse you.
No need, dear.
Trust me,
it was a steal.
We gotta get him inside.
Hold on. Easy does it.
How can we get some pancakes?
Watch it. Watch it.
I'm good.
Porter, for God sakes!
People are trying to sleep!
Hey, honey.
What are you doing here?
I thought you were gonna be
at the library studying.
We were and after we were done, I told
the guys I'd treat 'em to pancakes.
But the place was closed.
So we peed on the building.
Give it up, T-Scav!
You're drunk.
I beg your pardon.
He's drunk. I'm faced.
Do you have a sink?
What did this library have,
a 3-drink minimum?
After the library, we went to a bar,
and they got into
a cutthroat game of beer pong.
I'll just make 'em some pancakes
and take 'em home in the morning.
The morning?!
Can I talk to you a second, T-Scav,
away from these beer pong champs?
Actually, they lost.
It was kind of controversial...
I don't care! They're not staying.
Come on! Look at Niedermeyer.
I can't take him home.
You know how parents are.
Of course I do! We're parents!
Look...
I understand
you want the kids to like you
so they can elect you
homecoming king or whatever,
but you are not going back to
school to have some second childhood.
Enough is enough!
I hear you.
I hear you, too.
Wanna keep it down?
And as punishment, I'm having
Juanita draft a letter of apology
to every classmate
and family member who heard...
the verb in question.
That seems fair.
And of course, she won't be allowed
to participate in the final performances
of the Thanksgiving pageant.
Of course.
And she is also on cafeteria
cleaning detail for the next two weeks.
Absolutely.
Not so fast.
I'm sorry?
Come on, Mrs. Peterson.
A letter of apology? Fine.
Taking her out of the play?
She deserved that
based on her performance alone.
But let's not go overboard.
This school has a zero tolerance
policy when it comes to profanity.
And we respect that.
Right, honey?
Stay out of this, sweetheart. You need
to take a second look at that policy.
Juanita made a little slip.
It wasn't intentional.
It's not like she flipped
the bird afterwards.
My ruling stands.
If you can't do the time,
don't do the crime.
What is this, Shawshank elementary?
This school is not at fault.
If you want to assign blame,
you might look to
your dubious parenting skills.
I wish you hadn't said that.
Excuse me?
Juanita learned that word somewhere.
And I taught it to her?
No, I'm sure it was
whispered to her by the wind.
Let me tell you
something, Mrs. Peterson.
I am pulling Juanita out of
this crappy, crappy school!
Come on, Carlos!
"Crappy," huh?
What a shame Juanita won't be here
to blurt that out during
the pledge of allegiance.
Here's a blurt for ya...
And the horse you rode in on!
Don't shoot! It's just me.
Relax, Susan. It was a joke.
Is Mike here?
He is out on a job.
Darn it.
I wanted to talk to both of you
so I could apologize.
Over the past few weeks...
I've let my emotions
get the best of me.
I'm sure you've noticed
that my behavior has been...
crazy.
Just in the... clinical sense.
That's over.
I don't want there to be
any more tension between us.
When we see each other,
I want us to wave,
not dive behind a garbage can.
I didn't dive. I...
just dropped my keys.
I just want things
to be normal again.
Let me play poker
with you and the girls.
If you throw a party, invite me.
Maybe you and Mike can have me
over for a barbecue sometime.
Given what's happened,
I just don't see a barbecue
in our future.
Fine.
I was just hoping
to be friends again
and show all those people
how wrong they were.
What people?
The ones who keep telling me
that I should sue you for...
What did they call it?
"Reckless endangerment"?
I'm sorry. Who are all these people?
Neighbors, well-wishers,
a couple of lawyers
who dabble in civil lawsuits.
But I told them, "No,
I could never sue Susan."
In spite of everything,
we're still friends.
But...
if that isn't true anymore...
Brunch!
Mike and I aren't really
barbecue people.
We like a good brunch.
So... let's give that a shot.
I'm sorry. That was just
a bad choice of words.
I love it!
Sunday around 11:00?
I'll bring a quiche.
Great.
Aren't you glad
I'm not crazy anymore?
This is so much better.
We are over, Karl.
And this time I mean it.
Come on, Bree. You're gonna
dump me over a lousy brooch?
It's not the brooch, Karl. It's you.
Stealing Susan's jewelry and then
berating her for losing it?
What kind of man does that?
How about a man whose wife's
taking him to the cleaners,
who wants to get back
of what she's costing him?
How could you be so stupid
as to then give it to me?
Did it not occur to you
she might see me wearing it?
When we divorced,
she lost a lot of things.
I forgot the brooch was one of them.
That's your defense... That you
stole so much, you lost track?
Let's not forget
who had no problem staging a burglary
to protect her stuff from Orson.
I am not proud of that. I am
even less proud of letting my libido
blind me to the fact
that I've been fornicating
with a morally bankrupt weasel.
Not anymore.
We're done.
Wait.
Will you marry me?
Excuse me?
I know, not the best time to ask.
But I was scared if I waited,
I wouldn't get another shot.
Do you think I'd even...
Don't feel you need
to answer right away.
I'm pretty sure what
the short-term response would be. But...
I love you, Bree.
For God sakes, Karl.
And I'd be honored if you'd even
consider becoming my wife.
I'm not done.
The man who swiped that brooch...
that was the man I was.
The man I am now is a little better,
but he is nothing compared
to the man that I could be
with a woman like you as my wife.
There. Done.
Don't say anything.
Just go.
Think it over.
I only wanna say...
Just think.
I hope I'm not disturbing you.
I just want to thank you for the...
Are you okay?
You're crying. What's wrong?
Nothing. What's up?
I just wanted to tell you
how well our plan is working.
Our plan?
The one about taking
the high road with Susan.
I was just over there.
She doesn't have a clue.
Who's that?
My mother.
Where does she live?
She doesn't.
I'm sorry.
Tomorrow would've been her birthday.
Every year this time
I get a little depressed.
So let's go out.
I'll buy you lunch.
It's the least I can do
for my partner in crime.
Okay. You gotta stop with that.
What?
This "our plan," "partner in crime."
This is your thing with Susan.
You do what you wanna do.
You're just upset
because of your mother.
You know what?
I'll bake you
a pineapple upside down cake.
Best thing in the world
for depression!
I called every
private school in the area.
No openings until september.
Damn it. You couldn't wait
till summer to cuss out the principal?
I make no apologies.
She had it coming.
And I'd do it again.
She attacked our daughter.
I'm glad you're so devoted to Juanita
cause you're about to spend
a whole lot more time together.
What are you talking about?
I think we have other choice.
You're gonna have to homeschool her.
That's funny.
You're good, Carlos.
We needed something
to cut the tension.
But seriously, what do we do?
Seriously?
We enroll online,
they send us the curriculum,
and you teach her.
Before this gets ugly, you
do realize I don't know how to teach.
Really?
You taught Juanita
a few choice words.
Me? How about you?
What a blank of a day!
Earl at the office is such a blank.
I wanna kick the blank
out of his blank.
How about,
that blanking hair dresser
totally screwed up my blanking hair!
Look at me!
I'm totally blanked!
The blanking client
didn't sign the deal,
and we lost a blank load of money.
Blank, blank, blank!
We are both at fault.
But you're homeschooling her.
Fine, but I know someone
who isn't getting blanked tonight.
Fine with me.
I blanked off earlier.
Thanks again for the pie.
You're welcome.
So I see you're wearing the brooch.
I must say it was awfully sweet of Karl
to give you his grandmother's jewelry.
When you were married, did he
do that sort of thing often...
surprise you with little gifts?
Constantly.
Really?
Of course, after a while I...
knew that it just meant that
he'd cheated and was feeling guilty.
Once he went to Barbados and brought
me back a pair of sapphire earrings.
I cried for days.
So... why the sudden
fascination with Karl?
I'm hardly fascinated, just curious.
When you talk about your marriage
to him, it's always about the lies
and the cheating, and you never
really talk about the good times.
Well, there were wonderful times.
Yeah, he was
always a good kisser and...
he could always make me laugh.
The truth is,
if he had begged my forgiveness...
I mean, if just once...
he had told me
that he was willing to change...
The hell with Karl.
In fact...
here.
No, Susan. It's yours.
No, it's Karl's.
And the only jewelry I should
be wearing now is Mike's.
Well, if you insist.
And by the way, thanks.
It felt good to say a few nice things
about Karl for a change, you know.
Well, it was nice to hear them.
Here you go, Gaby.
It's kinda old.
It's from before
the Soviet Union broke up.
The Soviet Union broke up?
You sure you know what you're doing
with this homeschooling thing?
Juanita's in first grade.
She'll believe what I tell her.
Your phone.
I popped my button.
Actually, Lynette,
I'm not surprised.
What?
I wasn't gonna bring it up, but...
you have been getting
a little rounder lately.
Well, what can I tell you, Gaby?
I'm working long hours,
I'm not exercising,
eating a bunch of junk at work.
I wouldn't be surprised
if she gets even bigger than this.
Don't you have some homework?
Actually,
I've gotta pick up some books
at the library.
Good. I'll clean up.
Seriously, Lynette, you can lose
this weight in one month.
No, Gaby, I really can't.
Yes, you can,
and I'm gonna help you.
What do you say we meet every morning
at 7:00 and go for a run?
I don't know. That's right around
the time I'm getting the kids ready
for school.
You cannot let this go.
You know the expression, "The longer
you wait, the bigger the butt."
If you'll excuse me,
I have to get that.
It might be another friend calling
to tell me my ass is too fat.
I'm just trying to help.
All right.
Bye. I love you.
Hello?
No, T-Scav just left.
This is L-Scav.
May I help you?
I'm sorry. What party?
Would you like a slice
of Long Island watermelon?
Gosh, tempting,
but I just wanna find
my husband and bring him home.
He's not here.
Don't cover for him.
Somebody called our house
wanting to know
why he hadn't shown up
with the keg yet.
Brilliant.
Please.
Tom has actual responsibilities.
His Jell-O shots
and beer pong days are over
and I don't appreciate his new buddies
making him think they're not.
He's not our buddy.
I don't care.
I just wanna know where he is.
He just dropped off the keg
and left.
Wait! Wait!
If he's not your friend,
whyis he buying you a keg?
Why is he making you dinner
at our house?
Without this watermelon,
all these pretty girls
will stay sober,
and we know what that means.
Okay! Okay! We'll tell you!
Dude, she's got our melon!
Tom's doing stuff for us because
we gave him the answers to the midterm.
He's cheating off you?
No. We've got a connection in
the math department. We get the tests.
Can we get our watermelon back?
You coming to bed?
Just a sec.
So exhausted.
No, no, no. Wait. Wait.
I am not that exhausted.
Delfino Plumbing.
Exactly what's the problem?
I'm not on call tonight.
I'll try to stop by tomorrow.
That's right, Buster.
You're not going anywhere tonight.
No kidding.
Katherine can fix her own leak.
That was Katherine?
You gotta get over there right now.
Look, I know we've gotta be friends
with her, but not at 11:00.
And not when you're wearing this.
She could sue us.
She's not gonna sue us over this.
It's not like our dog peed
on her flowers. I shot her.
So call her back and tell
her you'll be right over.
Fine.
How long will it take anyway?
I don't know.
It's a leak in her master bath.
In the bedroom?
And Susan.
What are you doing here?
I came to assist my...
husband,
Get the job done in half the time.
Where's your sling?
My shoulder's
feeling much better. Thank you.
That's great!
So it doesn't hurt if I do this?
Why don't we take a look
at this leaky faucet?
Actually, it's the...
garbage disposal in the kitchen.
But I thought you said
it was in the master bath.
Seriously, why would a
garbage disposal be in the master bath?
Come on. This way.
It's just making this awful sound.
They're supposed to make
an awful sound.
What are you doing up here?
I knew I never should've
trusted you.
You just wanted Mike over here
to try to seduce him.
Really, Susan.
You have the most suspicious mind.
Please. Look at this place.
Even I'm getting turned on.
So I lit a few candles and
sprinkled some rose petals.
I do that every night.
Really?
Do you also drink
an entire bottle of champagne?
Maybe I have a little problem, okay?
No, you have a big problem.
There's no reason
to bring him into this.
You say that you do this every night
and he used to spend
a lot of nights here. So why don't
we see if it looks familiar to him?
I need you to come up here!
Come up here right now!
Stop! Stop! Stop that's evidence!
Leave me alone!
Oh, my God. A bubble bath?!
This is now
a bad Jackie Collins novel.
I want you out of my house.
You need help.
What you're doing here... it's sick!
You don't actually think
that rose petals and champagne
are gonna work on Mike.
He loves me!
Don't push me, Susan.
I'll sue you!
You know what?
Go ahead. Sue me!
And while you're at it, get me for
assault with a strawberry, too.
You bitch!
Crazy!
F.Y.I.,
we hate her again.
Mahoney called me
and told me that you...
Know about the cheating?
Yeah. I do.
What I don't know is what
the hell's the matter with you.
Why would you do something
that stupid?
Because it is a required course
that I will never use,
and...
I'm failing it.
You're failing?
We can't afford to have you fail.
I know.
That's why I did this,
so that I could focus all of
my attention on my core classes.
Are you failing those, too?
But it's touch-and-go.
My advisor warned me that learning
a language at my age
would be difficult and Mandarin
is one of the hardest.
I study and I study but I'm...
always behind.
Lynette, you gotta understand,
I am drowning here.
I don't care.
What?
You're having trouble in school?
Talk to me.
Talk to your professors. Hire a tutor.
What you don't do is cheat.
Come on, Lynette. It is statistics.
I'm never gonna use it.
It's the principle of the thing!
What if the kids found out?
What kind of example
are you setting for them?
The same one you're setting.
When Gabrielle asked you
if you were gaing weight,
didn't you lie?
Clearly that's different.
Why?
Because of the consequences.
You could get kicked out of school.
And you could lose
one of your best friends.
I'm going to tell Gaby the truth...
eventually.
And when you do, she'll tell Carlos.
And when he finds out
that his new vice president
lied to him, he may fire you.
You wanna talk to me
some more about consequences?
I think the way you're trying to
rationalize your behavior is pathetic
We are two middle-aged people.
We both know
the value of principles.
We also know something that we've
never told the kids... that there are,
sadly, some times
in life when you need to break
the rules in order to survive.
I cheated on a test. You don't want
to pat me on the back? Fine.
But don't act like you are
better than me cause you're not.
"'Okay" said Skippy.
"I'll meet you down
at red creek after school."
This is boring. Can I watch TV?
While you're here with me,
it's the same as if you were at school.
We just finished gym class.
Now it's time for reading.
Ironing isn't gym class.
Who's the teacher here, huh?
Read!
You read.
Come on.
Let's just finish this chapter.
Don't even think about it.
I'm warning you.
I am not playing.
Juanita, so help me God...
Pick it up!
Pick it up
or end up on the floor next to it.
Thank you. That's much better.
So what did we learn today?
Pick up the book!
Pick it up!
Gaby, what the hell is going on?!
It's called homeschooling!
Pick... up... the... book!
I did what you asked, Karl.
I went home and thought
about your proposal.
And? No, wait. Not yet.
Do I need to brace myself?
I'm not gonna say no.
Really?
Or yes. What's the point when I already
have a husband I can't seem to shake?
So for now, you might wanna
focus on getting me a divorce.
And if I do that, you'll marry me?
Not you.
But I am interested
in this other Karl...
the one you say
you're planning to become.
If you marry me.
Well, I'm afraid he's gonna have to
make an appearance sooner than that.
I think I can arrange a meeting.
That's another thing.
No sex for at least a month.
A month?
You are too adept at using it
to cloud my judgment. I wanna see you
through eyes that are clear, not
rolling back in my head.
So I have to be a good boy and no sex.
It's like we're married already.
Karl, if we go public with this,
let alone marry,
there will be serious consequences.
Susan may never speak to me again and
God only knows what Orson will do.
I will not even contemplate
paying that price
until I'm sure
you're damn well worth it.
And if can prove that you are...
then you can give this to me again.
And next time, it'll mean something.
Did you talk with her?
Is she ready to apologize?
Not quite.
She heard what you said to
the principal and she is blaming you
for her not being allowed
to go back to school.
So you defended me, right?
Well, that was a little tough,
what with her being right
and you being wrong.
What do you mean wrong?
I did what I did for her.
Really?
You don't think that maybe
a tiny bit of that was in response
to you being criticized as a mom?
Well, maybe the
"Horse you rode in on" part
but the original sentiment was
all in defense of our daughter.
Where does she get off
being mad at me?
She can't go to school
and be with her friends.
She can't have people over
because a chimp
mauled a clown at her birthday party.
She has every right to be mad.
You...
not so much.
It's me.
I know. It's been a long time.
I'm sorry.
No, you know I can't tell you that.
Just...
know that we're safe, okay?
Ma, please, don't cry.
We only have a few minutes
to talk, okay?
He's good.
He just turned 19.
I know. Can you believe it?
Yeah, I wish we could, too.
It's just too risky.
But, you know,
maybe one of these days...
Ma, I gotta go. I'll talk to you soon.
Rimanga bene, okay?
What you got there?
I thought you said
your mother was dead.
Yeah. That was
my mother-in-law. Nick's mom.
You call her "Ma"?
We're close.
I didn't hear you come in.
The front door was open.
Here.
Is that one of those prepaid phones?
When nick and I went on vacation,
we bought this to call home.
We had some minutes left over
so I figured I'd use them up.
What's on your mind, Katherine?
Well, I wanted to drop off the cake
as promised and tell you last night,
Susan and I had a big fight.
She threw me into the bathtub.
Really?
First she shoots me,
now she tries to drown me.
I'm going to the police, so
I'm gonna need that gun for evidence.
What gun?
The one she shot me with.
The one Danny gave Julie.
I really don't think it's a good idea
gettin' the police involved.
Just stick to your plan.
I hate that she can
get away with this.
Nick's not Italian, is he?
No. Why?
Because you were talking
to his mother in Italian.
She likes it.
Makes her feel sophisticated.
I have a doctor's appointment
in 40 minutes.
I really should get dressed.
But thank you for the cake.
What's that, sweetie, your homework?
It's all homework now, isn't it?
When I was young,
I used to get picked on
because I was the littlest kid
in my class,
and I couldn't defend myself
from the bullies.
And then I discovered
a part of me that was big...
my mouth.
And I've been fighting back
with it ever since.
So when Mrs. Peterson said those
mean things, I had to defend you.
Why? I said a bad word.
If you just let her punish me,
this would all be over.
Believe me, leaving that school
is gonna wind up being a good thing.
Mrs. Peterson is a bully.
I like Mrs. Peterson.
Okay.
I was wrong,
and I'm sorry you're upset.
You still think I'm a good mom,
right?
Honey?
Can we just read?
I'm telling you,
Katherine can not be trusted.
The way she talks about
stealing Mike back from you?
She has completely lost it.
Believe me, I know.
Mike and I have a new rule.
We're going to pretend
that Katherine doesn't exist.
You think that's gonna be enough?
You need to get her off the street.
Katherine hates you
and I'm not talkin'
"Dirty looks in the supermarket" hate.
That woman is dangerous.
Dangerous how?
I can't believe
I'm even saying this. But...
Do you know where Katherine was
the night that Julie was attacked?
That's crazy.
Why would Katherine
want to hurt Julie?
You had just married
the man that she loved.
It was dark.
A woman walked out of your house...
maybe she didn't think it was Julie.
There are so many rules
in this world.
That's why we must start learning them
while we are still children.
We are told very clearly...
"Don't say bad words."
"You're not allowed
to cheat on tests."
"It's not nice
to lie to your friends."
"You shouldn't covet a man
who isn't yours."
"And you shouldn't
betray a man who is."
So we grow up,
and still we break the rules...
completely forgetting
that if someone catches us,
we will be punished.
Hi, there.
Good afternoon, sir.
I was hopping to replace
a cameo brooch my wife purchased here.
I'd like to suprise her.
A brooch?
We don't have anything like that here.
You must be mistaking.
My wife was quiet specific
about where she purchased it.
I'm sorry.
We sell furniture.
She must have got it somewhere else.
Excuse me.
Previously on "Desperate Housewives"...
Old friends fought.
You knew that Julie was in trouble,
and you chose not to come to me.
New lovers lie.
Where did you get it, Bree?
She bought it? I'm assuming.
Uh, yes, at that little antique
store down on pearl street.
Sorry. We sell furniture.
She must have gotten it somewhere else.
And suspicion was born.
Do you know where Katherine was
the night that Julie was attacked?
Julie Mayer was having trouble sleeping.
You see, every time she closed her eyes,
she dreamt of her neighbor.
They met when she came to tutor his son.
Later, a chance encounter at a cafe
led to hours of conversation.
He asked to see her again...
and again...
and again.
And the next thing Julie knew,
she was having an affair
with a married man.
But then, after a close call,
she came to her senses
and told the man it was over.
Unfortunately for Julie,
Some men can't take "no" for an answer.
Can I come in?
What, that's it? It's
that simple to you?
You have to leave now.
Come on. Let's just talk about this.
There is nothing to talk about! Just go!
Yes, there is! Just
come on. Talk to me! huh?
Lynette. Hi. What's up?
I'm just dropping off that band
candy your mom bought from Penny.
Everything okay?
Yeah, everything's fine.
Um... Mr. Bolen was just leaving. Right?
Yeah, I guess I was. Hey, Lynette.
Hey, Nick.
What was that about?
What do you mean?
Well, I don't mean to pry. It's just...
When I was walking up,
I heard you two arguing.
He's the guy.
The guy?
The guy I was... having the affair with.
No. No!
Why did you tell me this?!
You asked.
Why not lie?
I'm late for work.
I would've bought anything.
Look, don't freak out. It's over.
Not for me. Now I have to tell your mom!
No, you don't.
She was pissed when I didn't
tell her you might be pregnant.
If I don't tell her
about this,  I'm dead.
Come on, Lynette.
I am serious!
She already shot Katherine.
Now she's got a taste for blood.
There's no reason to tell her anything.
I broke it off weeks ago.
Then why was he here?
He wants me to take him back.
Threaten to tell his wife.
He doesn't care. He says he loves me.
Oh, honey, you're smart enough
to know that that's a lie.
Right?
I keep trying to get over him,
but then he comes over here
and he says all this stuff,
and I... I just get so confused.
Listen to me.
I will handle this.
Really?
And you... you won't tell my mom?
No, I won't.
Thank you.
That night, for the first time in weeks,
Julie Mayer would sleep well.
Unfortunately,
Lynette Scavo would not.
"The Fairview Homeschooling Workbook"
was created to help parents
teach their children.
It's colorful,
very entertaining,
a bit challenging
and guaranteed to make teaching fun.
Pick that up, or I will
knock you into next week!
I hate fractions!
I don't care! You still
have to learn them!
Why? Fractions are boring!
Okay. Fine.
Let me make it more interesting for you.
Say I take Mrs. Doolittle...
you favorite doll...
and I chop her into thirds.
I bury one third in the yard.
I put another third down
the garbage disposal.
How much of Mrs.
Doolittle do you have left?
You're not gonna hurt her, are you?
It depends on how you
answer the question!
Gaby! Can I see you for a sec?
What is going on?
I'm teaching math.
By threatening her toys?
Well, maybe teacher's
a little tired, okay?
It's not the only thing
I have to do around here.
I also have to cook and clean.
Okay, I hear you.
It isn't fair that
all this falls on you.
I'll get you some help.
Thank you.
We'll get a housekeeper.
What? No, no, no, I'd
rather have a tutor.
You'd rather scrubs toilets
than teach your daughter?
Well, at least the
toilets won't talk back.
Gaby, she just had to leave
her school and all her friends.
And now her mother's gonna abandon her,
and leave her with some stranger? I don't think so.
No, but...
No "but"s. Juanita needs you right now.
You're doing this.
Don't worry. Your doll's safe.
If I'm gonna chop anything off,
it's gonna be something of your daddy's!
So you're saying you
won't even talk to her?
No, we already interviewed Mrs. Mayfair.
That's when you thought
Danny Bolen had attacked Julie.
You treated her like a witness.
Now you need to treat
her like a suspect.
Look, miss, we're not trying
to dismiss your concerns,
but women don't commit
this kind of crime.
They tend to keep at a physical remove
from their victims...
vehicular assaults, poison.
Well, maybe Katherine was
thinking outside the box.
Hey, did you get any mayo?
-Yeah.
Look, I was skeptical, too,
but she does have a motive.
She hates Susan.
Well, that's a motive to attack her.
Well, maybe Katherine saw
Julie taking out the garbage
and thought it was me.
She mistook you
for a 23-year-old?
I'm sorry, Mrs. Delfino, but, uh,
unless you've got actual evidence,
we're gonna keep assuming that
this is a random incident...
one that your daughter
thankfully survived.
Damn it! They forgot the pickle!
What is with this place?
Is there anyone here that understands
a woman can be a psycho killer, too?
Ah, maybe I can help.
You want me to take this one?
Have at it.
Thank you so much.
So how about I, uh,
take a look at your file?
I will swing by tomorrow,
and I'll get your statement then.
Great.
Well... It is nice to know that someone
Cares about justice More than pickles.
Come on, Mike.
Are you sure you want this case?
'Cause I've got a serial killer
here that might be more fun.
Nah, she and I go way back.
She doesn't remember
me now, but she will.
I wish you hadn't committed us to this.
Why? They're our neighbors,
and they've been asking us for weeks.
I'm not a fan of Angie Bolen.
She can be very forward.
I like her. She's earthy,
takes a real interest in people.
Yes. Last week, she asked
me how much my dress cost
and did I still get
visits from my Aunt Flo.
Well, I believe that's
a euphemism for...
I know what it means.
By the way, I stopped by
that antique store today...
the one where you said
you bought that brooch.
I thought I'd get you a replacement
since you gave yours to Susan.
But the owner said they
don't sell jewelry there.
Just furniture.
Well, that's odd.
I must've confused that store
with the jewelry shop on Maple Street.
Yes, I remember now.
That's where I bought it.
Hey, look who's here!
My goodness. Another course?
Well, my grandma Bombelli always said,
"If the men can still button their
pants, dinner ain't over yet."
Is her braciole amazing or what?
I have to admit, I've
never had this before.
And it is quite tasty.
Aw, thanks, hon. Hang on a sec.
You don't want to stain
that gorgeous blouse.
I'm actually a very neat eater.
Oh, hey, when Nick here
starts twirlin' his pasta,
nobody's safe.
I did get some friendly
fire from a meatball earlier.
I'm glad we're finally doing this.
You two are hard to pin down.
Well, we've been incredibly busy.
Oh, I'll bet, especially
since Katherine wigged out
and you had to give her the boot.
You know, if you need
someone to replace her,
you could a lot worse than Angie.
Oh?
Yeah, her grandma Bombelli had
the best restaurant in little Italy
and taught Angie everything she knew.
I mean...
If you're lookin' for help.
Well, if your food is all this good...
We're... not hiring.
Sorry.
Okay. It's just a thought.
You sure, Bree?
She said no.
No, I'm just sayin'... you
don't know what you're missin'.
Nick, she's had four courses.
She knows what she's missing.
Now zip it.
Don't bite my head off.
I'm just tryin' to help.
What, by embarrassing our guests?
Just ignore him, okay?
It was your idea to cook for her.
Thank you! Now they're gonna think
that I don't cook for people
unless I have an angle.
I am so sorry.
Now look at them. They're
wishin' they hadn't come.
No! we're having a lovely time.
No! we're thrilled to be here!
Perfect! Now you're
makin' our guests lie.
I'm gonna go stir the sauce.
I'll get more wine.
We're gonna need it.
Uh, just curious, how many more courses?
Three.
Orson, I never thought
I'd say this to you again,
but please... unbutton your pants.
Okay.
If you have half a cabbage,
and someone gives you a quarter cabbage,
how much cabbage do you have?
None, because I hate cabbages
and I wouldn't take 'em.
Fine. They're balloons.
There's no such thing as half a balloon.
Well, there is a such
thing as half an allowance,
which is what you're gonna get
if you don't start to focus.
Why can't I just use a calculator?
'Cause you have to know this stuff.
If not, you're gonna end up
scrubbing other people's toilets!
Sorry.
Look, if you finish this page,
we'll go get some ice cream.
How's that sound?
I don't want to have ice cream with you.
I'm gonna get some air.
Will you make sure she
doesn't move from the table?
What do you call this again?
Uh, foie gras mousse.
Mmm. Tastes so elegant.
Don't you think it's elegant?
It's okay.
Would you like to sample
something else, Mr. Vitale?
Some salmon en croute or
perhaps some coq au vin?
Got anything I can pronounce?
You don't need to pronounce it.
You just gotta wipe it off your shirt.
You wanna end up on a plate
next to the salmon, keep it up.
I... I'm sorry we wasted your time.
My husband doesn't understand
elegant food. He's an ignoramus.
Hey, this ignoramus is throwing you
an anniversary party for 500 people.
500, you say?
Let's, um, sit down
and figure something out
because I would really
love to cater this party.
Look, you seem like a nice lady.
It's just that our guests
are comin' in from the Bronx.
They don't know from fancy food.
It's more of a sausage and
peppers crowd. I'm sorry.
I could make you braciole.
You can do braciole?
Yes, and, uh...
gnocchi and tortelloni
and, uh, lasagna verde.
But none of that stuff's on your menu.
That's because they're family recipes
from... my grandmother Bombelli.
You're Italian? You don't look it.
Papa was Irish.
I may get my hair
from the o'rourke side,
but my stomach...
She's all bombelli.
If you give me this job,
I will feed your family my stracotto
till the men can't button their pants.
Now that's what we're
lookin' for. You're hired.
Ahh! I feel better.
All right, let's get back to it.
Hold it. You got all
these problems right?
You cheated, didn't you? Confess!
No, Ivana helped me.
Who's Ivana?
That's me.
We met when you handed
me this bucket and rag.
Oh. yeah. Right.
Sorry. Uh, you helped her?
I told her to look at fractions
like a big chocolate cake.
The bottom number is the whole thing,
and the top number
represents how many slices.
Well, I should've known cake would
make everything come into focus.
Math is my specialty.
I have a PHD in engineering
from the University of Bucharest.
But it means nothing in the
American job market. So...
Wow. A doctor.
Impressive.
Oh, the upstairs bathroom has a
bunch of hair stuck in the drain.
Can you take care of that?
Sure.
Mom, this next page doesn't
make sense. I need help.
Uh... doctor?
I'm thinking that drain can wait.
Nick...
Hey, Lynette! Perfect timing.
I was just thinking about
busting open a bottle of wine.
Well, actually, I'm
here to talk to Nick.
I was admiring your roses
and I was hoping you could
give me a few pointers.
Honey, you hear that?
People are asking us for gardening tips.
We are officially suburban.
Oh, so... wine?
Uh... you go ahead.
All right.
Thanks,
though.  Mm-hmm.
So here's the key...
you, uh, you cut going away from the bud
at a 45 degree angle...
I know about you and Julie.
For God sakes, you're twice her age.
Okay, Lynette, this is
none of your business.
No offense.
None taken.
But you know who might
be offended? Her father.
If Karl finds out, he's
gonna come over here
and cut your buds off
at a 45 degree angle.
Yeah, thanks for the warning.
I mean it.
If you don't stop bothering
julie, you will be sorry.
Happy gardening.
Wait, hang on a second. Hang on. Hang...
Wait, Julie said I was bothering her?
Did she also tell you that
she started this whole thing?
She came after me.
All right, there are
two sides to every story.
Yeah, well, your side is married.
Look, I tried to resist.
She just wore me down,
talking about how she'd
never met anybody like me,
she never felt this way before.
She's been jerking me
around since the day we met.
I don't care! Just leave her alone.
Yeah, all right. all right, fine.
If I find out you told anyone about us
you're the one who's gonna be sorry.
So like I said, you
wanna water the roses
you know, a few times a week.
Don't get anything on the foliage.
That's how they get diseased. all right?
Hey, thanks, baby.
You okay?
I think I might know
who strangled julie.
Hey, good timing. I'm
putting dinner on the table.
I thought the housekeeper
was supposed to start today.
She did, and she's fantastic!
And her family escaped from Romania
with practically nothing.
Well, what were they
fleeing from, cleanliness?
Well, I... I didn't wanna just
throw work at her the first day.
We needed time to bond.
Okay, so when does she start
bonding with the dishwasher?
Daddy, look what I did!
Fractions! All right!
So mommy taught you how to do fractions.
Mommy didn't. Ivana...
Ivana take all the credit myself!
Can you believe her?
After all the work I've done...
let's go teach you some manners.
So the best I can figure,
the attack happened
around 11:30 that night.
Now people saw Katherine
leaving the wedding in the afternoon,
and no one saw her again
until the next morning.
So... you have to wonder.
Um... I am sorry
but aren't you gonna
write some of this down?
You totally don't remember me, do you?
Oh, my gosh!
No. sorry. uh, can I get a little help?
Denise. Denise Lapera.
Of course!
A little more help, please?
Fairview High.
I used to sit behind you in
Mr. Parsons' English class.
Oh, my God! I am such an idiot!
Denise Lapeera!
Lapera.
Lapera.
Mr. Parsons.
"Pit-stain" Parsons.
Oh, gosh. I wonder what
ever happened to him.
Yeah, I actually arrested
him a few years back.
Twice. Drunk driving.
He got a little aggressive.
I had to use my taser.
Part of my was like
"zip! And that's for 'Beowulf'!"
That's good times.
Oh, good times.
And the good times just keep
rolling for you, huh, Susan?
I mean, look, you got a handsome husband
and two beautiful
children and a lovely home.
Oh. Well, how about
you, Detective lapeera?
Lapera.
Lapera.
Uh, I, you know, you have
done very well for yourself.
Professionally, maybe.
But I'm living in my mother's basement.
I'm sorry.
Uh, divorced?
Never married.
Dating anyone?
No, but I did bowl a
179 the other night.
And you're a detective.
So back to Katherine.
Uh, is there, you know, anything else
That you would need
to know? No, I'm good.
I'll just head over
there now and nose around
and see if she has an alibi.
Oh, actually, uh,
Denise, one more thing.
Um, this is a very
tight-knit community,
and I'm afraid if Katherine
finds out that I'm the one
that accused her of this,
things could get ugly.
Aw, we wouldn't want that, would we?
Exactly, so maybe you could just say
it was an anonymous tip or something.
Sure.
Thanks.
Oh, say hi to your mom.
Yeah, we don't speak.
Oh, look. what a nice gift.
It's the least I could do to thank you
for that marvelous dinner.
Oh, please, we should be
thanking you for not walking out
when me and Nick started
screaming at each other.
Oh, it was just one course.
The rest of the meal
was extremely quiet.
God, you are so tactful.
You think you can teach me some of that?
And take away that earthy
charm? I wouldn't think of it.
Listen, Angie, I have this friend
coming to town next
week, and I would love
to serve her that
dinner you made for us,
if you don't mind sharing your recipes.
Oh, gee, I would love to
help, but grandma bombelli
was real strict about not
sharing the family recipes.
Please?
This friend just loves
good italian food.
Take her to Piccolino.
Their food is good.
Um... this friend...
she doesn't really go
to restaurants anymore,
not since the fire.
People stare, so...
Oh, my God. that's awful. you know what?
Grandma would want this
woman to eat well. Hold on.
Okay, we got the gnocchi, lasagna verde,
the tortelloni, the braciole,
the stracotto, arancini
and the polenta cake.
But... I'm making a big exception here,
so promise you won't
go passing these around.
Trust me. I will treat these
recipes as if they were my own.
She has been over there
a long time, hasn't she?
Man, are there enough photos
of you in this yearbook?
Wow. Do you still have this cheerleading outfit?
Mike!
I just thought if you put it on,
it might jog your memory.
Looking at Denise's
photo might do the trick.
Hey, here she is. Yikes.
Hair in the '80s... what
were you girls thinking?
Oh, my God. Moose.
Too much mousse, if you ask me.
No, the animal. That was her nickname.
Oh, God. Oh, God.
What's wrong?
This is moose Lapera.
She was the only girl that
hated me in high school.
Why?
I may have mentioned to Beth Porter
that... she had a laugh like a moose.
You gave her the nickname?
No, I just made that comparison.
Beth is the one that got
the entire school to go...
whenever she walked by.
And she hates you because of that?
Well, and also... I
kinda stole her boyfriend.
"Kind of"?
She spent all senior year
in love with Mark Malone,
and they went on, like, one date,
and mark noticed me and
dumped moose to ask me out.
So the guy came after
you. Wasn't your fault.
Clearly you were never
a high school girl.
Moose was convinced that
I stole Mark from her,
just like Katherine is
convinced that I... oh, my God!
I sent her over there.
It's like a meeting of
the "I hate Susan" club!
What am I gonna do?
This was a long time ago.
Nobody holds a grudge that long.
Hey, maybe you're right. Look at this.
I think she might be
arresting Katherine right now.
That is a perp walk.
She is taking Katherine on a perp walk.
Looks more like a perp hug.
What is going on?
What... what is she doing?
I think she's showing us how long
someone can hold her grudge.
Juanita, I was thinking,
after you and Ivana
finish your schoolwork,
would you like to go
see a movie with me...
just the two of us.
Cool! Can we have
junior mints for dinner?
Wouldn't be a movie if you
weren't throwing up candy
on the ride home.
Hi. Can I help you?
Hola. I'm Christina.
From happy housekeeper?
Oh! Oh, there must be some mistake.
Uh, our maid is Ivana.
I request Ivana. Where's Ivana?
My english not so good.
It's okay. It's our new cleaning lady.
Gracias por venir.
Would you excuse us
one moment? Un momento.
What do you mean, new cleaning lady?
Where's Ivana?
I called the agency and had
them send over someone else.
Well... why?
Because Ivana sucked,
and not in that good vacuum sort of way.
Hey, cut her some slack. She's Romanian.
Okay, when your people are
being chased into Argentina
by angry cossacks,
maybe a sparkling toilet
isn't that important.
Argentina?
How about you stick to fractions,
and I'll teach Juanita geography?
Good bye
Gracias.
So how do you feel about
teaching math to 7-year-olds?
My english...
Not so good.
Yeah, I know.
Knock, knock!
Angie, what are you doing here?
Oh, your shortbread was so good,
I made you a batch
of my pignoli cookies.
How incredibly thoughtful of you.
Hey, I smell marinara.
You cooking my food for your friend?
Yes, and I am way behind, so...
Oh! Well, let me help you, then! Wow.
You sure got a lot of sauce here.
Lot of potatoes, too.
This is all for three people?
Well, with food like yours,
who wouldn't want leftovers?
"Vitale anniversary party
arancino, gnocchi, braciole."
You were stealing my
recipes for a catering job.
I wanted to serve foie gras.
The client demanded pasta.
So you come running to
me with some sob story
about a burn victim who can
only be healed by manicott'?
I admit that was a bit tacky.
I lit a candle for that woman!
If you think about it,
it was a huge compliment.
And the compliment is
that my food is good
enough for your business
but I'm not.
I would never say you
weren't good enough.
Of course you wouldn't. You're tactful.
But you know what? I'm
not, which is why I can say
that you're a two-faced,
condescending bitch
who will never make a nickel
off my dead grandma's braciole!
But enjoy the cookies!
That's insane.
I know this is hard for you.
It's impossible. It
couldn't have been Nick.
How can you be so sure? It was dark.
You told the police you
couldn't see who attacked you.
This doesn't make any
sense. He loves me.
Exactly, and you broke up with him.
Honey, this is something
we have to consider.
Well, I can't consider
it, okay? I just can't.
Julie... we watched you grow up.
You're like a daughter to us.
We can't stand by and do nothing.
So you're gonna talk to the police
no matter what I say.
I think we have to.
It just couldn't be him.
You. What are you doing here?
The agency gave me this address.
Please, Ivana, I need you to come back.
Your husband told the agency
that I am a lousy housekeeper.
You never told him
what I was really doing.
The agency almost fired
me. You have to leave.
Oh, no, no, no! Wait! Wait!
I need you!
Juanita needs you.
See? She needs you.
She has a test tomorrow,
and when I teach her, one
of us ends up in tears.
Don't make me teach my baby.
I'm sorry. I have floors to scrub.
Forget scrubbing.
Ivana, you have a gift.
Share it with the world,
starting with my daughter.
What about the floor?
You missed a spot.
Got a minute?
This really isn't a good time.
Ooh. Gnocchi.
Tasty.
Don't patronize me.
Angie's are light as air.
Mine are like little shot puts.
Well, perhaps this will cheer you up.
I went to that jewelry store on Maple
and look what I found.
You like it?
I told you, I don't have time for this.
You know, it's odd. I asked
them about the first brooch,
but they said...
Oh, for God sakes, Orson,
would you just stop it?!
I have told you again and
again I want a divorce.
Do you think you can change
my mind with trinkets?
I don't want jewelry. I
don't want romantic gestures.
I want out! Now would
you please leave me alone?
Or for God sakes, I swear
I'll throw something at you!
Just not one of the gnocchi.
Those things could put a man's eye out.
Sorry I'm late!
I had to take down some geezer
in the ten items or less line.
Ivana, you should probably split
before Carlos gets ho... oh, my!
Yeah, I got off work early,
so I let our cleaning woman go home.
Juanita, good job. Let's
knock off early today.
Okay, daddy.
Do you hear that? I
think Celia fell down.
Gaby.
I'm sorry.
I asked you for help.
I asked for a tutor, and you said no.
Because you're her mother.
You should be able to set
aside a few hours each day
to teach your own daughter.
And I will teach her.
There's so many things
I'm gonna teach her...
how to dress, how to put on makeup.
I'll even show her how to
get a boy to notice her.
That's stuff I know. And
we're gonna have so much fun.
But fractions and grammar and history...
it's just not my
thing, and she knows it.
And then she gets frustrated
because I'm frustrated.
And it's ruining our relationship.
Come on, Gaby. Let's not exaggerate.
Carlos, she turned me down
when I asked to take her for ice cream.
I know. I know.
Some moms are made to homeschool,
and I'm just not one of them.
Okay.
I get it. hmm?
We will figure something else out.
You won't have to
homeschool her anymore.
Oh. Thank you, Carlos.
You're welcome.
Can I keep the housekeeper?
Absolutely not.
I know. I know.
May I come in, please?
What now?
Um... I just...
Came to say I'm sorry.
What I did was wrong,
and those names you called me were harsh
but regrettably accurate.
I don't know if you'd even
consider working for me now,
but if you would, I would be honored
to have you in my kitchen.
Well, well, well. You must
be drowning over there.
All right, I'm drowning.
And you want me to save you.
Please.
First, tell me this.
Why don't you like me?
I like you.
I find you colorful and...
Oh, enough with the tact.
Fine. I...
You make me uncomfortable.
I don't know how to respond
when someone is as candid as you are.
You say whatever pops in your mind.
You fight with your husband
in front of guests...
Oh, well, not everyone's marriage
is as perfect as yours, Nancy Reagan.
My marriage is not perfect.
Oh, come on.
Orson and I barely speak
to each other anymore.
We haven't shared a bed in three months.
Seriously?
Well, I never would've guessed.
That's the point.
Our problems are personal.
We don't share them with the world.
But you can't seem to
keep anything to yourself.
What?
Trust me, honey.
If there's one thing I know how to do,
it's keep things to myself.
Well... there we are.
You think I'm vulgar.
Oh, excuse me. Candid.
And I think you're a tight ass.
But you need help, and I need a job,
so... let's get cookin'.
You mean it?
Thank you, Angie.
You're a lifesaver.
So... no sex for three months.
What do you do, sit on the dryer?
Okay, now you're just goading me.
One ham on wheat, extra mayo.
Corned beef, lean,
and of course, an entire jar of pickles.
What's this about?
Honestly, uh, I don't
think this new detective
is up to the job,
and I need a couple of seasoned pros
with old school savvy...
Oh, hello, Susan.
Denise.
Why don't you call me
"Moose"? You know you want to.
Moose?
Moose?
Denise, I'm glad I ran into you.
I... I came down here to apologize.
No, you came down here to
get me kicked off the case.
Okay. One more thing to apologize for.
So look, um, I really am
sorry about Mark Malone,
but that was ages ago,
and that guy had "loser"
written all over him.
Hmm. He's the CEO of Malone Enterprises
with a 6-bedroom home
overlooking the lake.
Okay. The point is,
I'd hate for our history
to cloud your judgment
in this case.
You think I'm behaving unprofessionally.
Well...
when you were leaving
Katherine's house the other day,
you two did look... pretty chummy.
Oh, well, it turns out
we have a lot in common.
We both had boyfriends stolen by you.
I did not steal Mike.
Katherine just thinks that I did,
which is why I'm betting
she strangled Julie.
Yeah, well, she couldn't have,
because she was on the phone
all night with her daughter,
and the phone records confirm it.
Are you sure?
I know how to do my job, Susan.
In fact, I've discovered
some interesting facts
while investigating this case.
Is it true
that on the evening of September 16th
at approximately 11:45,
you shot Katherine Mayfair?
What? That was an accident.
And you not reporting it was a crime.
Okay, um, let's not blow
this out of proportion.
I hurt you,
but you've gotta get past
this. You can't keep blaming me
for the way that your life turned out.
It's just... it's gonna make
you bitter and miserable,
like Katherine.
You need closure, Denise.
You have the right to be happy.
And you have the right
to remain silent.
In you go!
Hey, Susan, you know
what this is called?
Closure.
The Julie Mayer assault?
We're not on that case anymore.
Detective Lapera's handling that.
Why?
Well, we have some new
information to report.
The detective is out
on a call at the moment.
This needs to be checked out right away.
What needs to be checked out right away?
Did you guys ever talk to Nick Bolen?
The dad of the kid we arrested.
Yeah, yeah, we talked to him.
I'm guessing he didn't
mention that he and Julie
were having an affair.
She broke it off right
before she was attacked.
No kiddin'.
Hey, babe. What's up?
Good news. I am a working girl.
Bree asked me to join her company.
Yeah? Hey, that's great.
Hey, you're still gonna
cook for me, right?
Are you kidding? You're my guinea pig.
Mwah. Congrats.
Oh, and there was something
else I needed to tell you.
Oh, right, right, right. Cops called.
They wanted to know where you were
the night that Julie
Mayer was strangled.
What?
Why would they be asking about me?
I guess because you were
having an affair with her?
Look, I don't know what they told you.
They didn't tell me anything.
I've known for weeks.
Ange...
don't. Don't embarrass
yourself... or me.
You did a stupid thing.
But I know you can't go anywhere,
and you know I can't go anywhere.
So we're gonna have to get past this.
I'm so sorry.
I've put you through a
lot, so you get this one.
But that's it.
You know I never attacked her.
And that is why I lied and told the cops
you were with me the entire night.
So we're okay?
Now we're okay.
The truth is,
there's only so much
we can learn from books.
They can't tell you how
to make your wife happy.
They can't tell you how to
appreciate your neighbor.
They can't tell you
if that man across the
street is dangerous.
No, the only way to truly
learn is from your mistakes.
Of course, if those
mistakes land you in jail,
it might be nice to have a book
to pass the time.

Previously
on Desperate Housewives...
No sex for at least a month.
Bree made a decision...
Focus on getting me a divorce.
And hired Angie.
Let's get cookin'.
Gaby struggled at home.
What is going on?
It's called homeschooling!
Lynette's body was changing.
I have to hide these things at work
so Carlos doesn't find out I'm pregnant.
Cops wanted to know where you
were when Julie was strangled.
You know I never attacked her.
Angie knew about the affair.
Is it true you shot
Katherine Mayfair?
And Susan got in trouble.
If someone wanted proof
that judge Mary Gallagher
had a sense of humor,
all they needed to do
was watch her pronounce sentence.
For the slum lord
who refused to fix a furnace...
You have to live in your own
tenement for a month...
Starting in december.
The woman who threw a phone
at her maid...
You will clean Mrs. Garcia's
home for the next six weeks.
And, yes, you will do windows.
For the high school coach who made
lewd remarks to a cheerleader...
At the next school assembly,
you will perform a cheer...
in uniform.
And I'd shave those legs
if I were you.
And then there was
the case of the housewife
who shot her neighbor...
So, she just popped up
in my window, and I fired.
It was an accident.
Liar!
It was no accident!
She wanted me dead.
I did not.
At least, not then.
As you can see, your honor, this
is an unfortunate situation.
It's a mess is what it is.
I assume there's some history here.
She once dated my husband.
She stole him from me.
Stole?
He came screaming back
like he was running from a fire.
Enough.
I take it
you're the man in question.
Yes, your honor.
I could see shooting someone
over you.
Thank you?
I'm gonna rule now.
My inclination is to avoid
giving out jail time in this case.
I object!
Overruled!
However...
a firearm was discharged and
there are consequences for that.
Your honor, before you hand
down your ruling, may I say something?
Make it quick. I already
find you uninteresting.
Not only
did Susan shoot me
at point-blank range,
she trashed me to all of
my friends and neighbors,
telling them I was some kind
of crazy, stalking nut!
That true?
Have you been trashing her?
I...
Never said "nut."
I... Said "loon."
I trashed her a little.
But what I said was true,
and that's free speech.
You can't punish me for that.
Yes, when it came to sentencing,
judge Mary Gallagher
had a sense of humor.
But not everyone
found her funny.
Par la Wisteria Team:
MiniBen314, Jayson.Sosweet

There is a coffee shop in Fairview.
It's known as a place where you
can read your morning paper...
Where you can meet your friends...
Where you can bump
into your neighbors...
Whether you want to or not.
I hope they have decaf today.
Last time I was here, they were out,
so I had to have regular and got
so wired, I didn't sleep all night.
Does that happen to you?
Seriously? You think I'm gonna
make small talk with you?
Excuse me?
I know you slept with my husband.
So... I'm thinkin' we're
past the chit-chat stage.
I am so sorry.
Let me tell you how shame works.
When you see the wife
of the guy you banged,
you don't make conversation.
You don't even smile and say hi.
You avert your gaze and you blush.
Nod if you understand.
Here's your mocha latte.
That'll be $3.50.
It's on her.
She owes me.
You're gonna be late for class.
Dad?
All my clothes are too tight.
I had to borrow yours.
I was gonna wear that shirt today.
When you're hiding your fourth
month of pregnancy with twins,
you can have it back.
What do you think?
I'm still attracted to you
in men's clothes.
Is that weird?
All I need is to pull
this off for two more days.
You should've told Carlos
two months ago.
There's no way he won't
be furious when he finds out.
I may be wearing men's clothes
but I am not an idiot.
I've got this.
Terrence Henderson and I
are about to close the biggest deal
in the history of this company.
Once Carlos sees
how great Terrence is,
he'll see the work can still get
done even when I'm on maternity leave.
And you're sure this deal
is gonna close?
That's why we need
to keep our fingers crossed.
Wish me luck.
Good luck.
Now come here, mister.
I wanna kiss ya.
Now it's weird.
Bless me, father, for I have sinned.
Go ahead, my child.
I've been homeschooling my daughter
and it's been a living hell,
so I tried to bribe someone
to get her into catholic school.
And, what happened?
You tell me.
What are you doing?
Come on. You're the head of admissions.
You've got a great school here,
but there's a 2-year waiting list!
Put your money away.
It's your money. Sleep with it
for a while. See how it feels.
I wish I could help,
but my hands are tied.
I'm not asking you
to part the Red Sea.
Just find a spot
for one kid in the second grade.
If a student were to withdraw,
I might be able to move you
to the top of the waiting list.
Fantastic!
But frankly, we tend to favor those
who are more faithful.
What does that mean?
I've noticed that you
don't come to mass very often.
I hear ya, padre. You're okay
with money as long as it comes
in one of those wicker
baskets you pass around.
That's not what I'm saying.
Of course not.
I realize it's dark in here,
but just know I'm winking back.
So your first opera...
That's quite a milestone.
Throw in "last,"
and it's two milestones.
Stop. I saw you tear up
at the end of act two.
Only because I realized
there was an act three.
"Madame Butterfly"
is Puccini's masterpiece.
Didn't you enjoy it just a little?
What about that scene
when Butterfly tells her child
not to feel sorrow
for her mother's desertion?
Didn't that make you feel anything?
Actually,
that's when you leaned forward,
and I saw a little peek of your boob.
I guess it made me feel horny.
Karl, don't.
Come on. It's a dark
parking structure.
They gonna think I'm mugging you.
We agreed no sex for a month.
We need to find out if we can be
together in a nonsexual manner.
I'm serious.
Can you keep your hands to yourself?
Can I? Thanks to you,
it's my only choice.
How was your business dinner?
Our bid was too high. It looks like
they're gonna go with another caterer.
What are you listening to?
It's a new recording
of "Madame Butterfly."
Isn't that glorious?
It is.
I should go to bed.
All right, guys. You sign the lease,
and we'll pop the champagne.
The Florida branch
is officially a go.
Terrific. When do we get
our branch manager?
We have got somebody great lined up.
We just need to finalize some things.
We'll get back to you. Thanks.
Who do we have lined up?
Nobody. That's the thing
we need to finalize.
But today, we celebrate.
You really hit this one out of the park.
I gotta give credit where
credit is due. Terrence did a lot
of the heavy lifting on this
and I don't care if I embarrass him.
This guy is a star.
Strangely, I'm not embarrassed.
I didn't want to interrupt your
phone call but your wife is here.
Tell her to wait in my
office until we're finished.
You listen to me, Carlos Solis!
I just came from St. Ursula's
and we've got big trouble!
Do not blow me off!
According to the catholic church,
we're not holy enough.
But I have a feeling a big, fat
check might slap on a halo.
How big?
Somethingthat'll make a priest say
"holy" and "mother"
in the same sentence. That should
get her to the top of the list.
I'm not going to write a big check
on the chance that it might get her in.
I can't do this now.
You know the problems that I'm facing
trying to get the new Florida office up
and running. Now if you don't mind...
Fine.
Can I trouble you for $5?
I'll buy Juanita a hairnet
and prepare her for a future
in the fast food industry.
Hello... Gentlemen.
What? A lot of people
are wearing this style.
Well, doesn't make it right.
I heard you mention St. Ursula's.
It is worth the hassle.
Our daughter Molly's in
the second grade. She loves it there.
I didn't know Molly was
in the same grade as Juanita.
Would you excuse me?
That branch in Florida?
I think I found our man.
You can't send Terrence to Florida.
You should take it as a compliment.
You trained him well.
Exactly. You can't send him away.
What if you need him?
Why would I? I've got you.
But...
What if I was hit by a bus
and I was... Put on bed rest
for, say, three months?
Who would cover for me?
That's not gonna happen.
You jinxed it. Now for sure some
version of that is gonna happen.
It's done. We are
sending Terrence to Florida.
And I really like this new look
that you've got going but careful...
Roberta in accounting asked if
you'd like to go bowling with her.
What are you doing here?
I was just having lunch with some
friends who are not on a chain gang.
Thought I'd stop by and say hi.
You mean stop by and gloat.
Maybe a little.
So... How's it going?
Meeting anybody?
They say the friends you make
on the inside... You'll have for life.
Yes, Katherine, this all sucks.
But you know what?
At the end of the day,
I go home to Mike...
which means I won.
That's big talk for a woman
standing in an orange jumpsuit
with blisters on her feet.
Mike will rub them when I go home.
And for the record,
I totally make this work.
The fact that you think
you look good in orange
show I'm not dealing
with a rational person.
By the way...
you missed something.
No, I didn't.
Yeah, you did.
Come back here!
She littered! Shoot her!
What a moron.
I wish I'd caught her license
plate number. She'd be sorry.
Really?
What kind of damage could you do
with her home address?
You missed something.
Did you get 'em all?
You're supposed to eat it,
not wear it.
They call it crumb cake
for a reason.
Can you steam me some 2% milk?
This is what happens
when I'm five minutes late?
What?
The waitress with the hands.
She was brushing crumbs
off my shirt.
What, the ones Julie missed?
Is this how it's gonna be
every time I talk to a woman?
Probably.
I'm sorry. I don't know
how many times I can say it.
I'll do anything you want.
I'll do couples therapy.
Great idea.
Let's tell somebody all our secrets
and when we're cured,
we can kill him.
I don't know what you want.
I want you to be the guy
you used to be,
the guy who saved my life,
not the guy who destroyed it.
How we doing here?
Never been better,
Come on in!
This is so nice of you.
It's not every day that one
of my associates gets a big
promotion.
Thank you.
Why don't you take Crystal
in the den and get comfortable
while I steal this guy
to help me make cocktails?
Come on. Right this way.
How excited are you? Miami?
Pretty jazzed.
It's an exciting opportunity.
I think it's great how you're
concentrating on the upside of this.
There's a downside?
Not really.
Forget I mentioned it.
It's just...
Do you remember Tim Baker
who was sent to head up
our Chicago office?
Never heard of him.
Exactly.
So... You are moving to Florida.
Pecan?
No, thanks. I'm on a diet.
I can't wait.
No more winter.
Just heat and hurricanes.
I'm willing to put up with that.
Miami has so many
other things to offer.
It certainly must to attract
all those colombian drug lords.
The Chicago branch was a little slow
out of the gate. Corporate freaked
and made Tim the scapegoat.
Where is he now?
He's in plastics...
or paper, depending on what you want
your groceries in. Wine?
And when they cut
into the alligator's stomach,
not only was the guy's arm
still intact,
but it was still holding
his golf club.
He would've been fine
if his wife hadn't left him.
That led directly to the alcoholism,
which probably had something to
do with him threatening the president.
Is that a bitch on the old resume.
That humidity... Your hair?
I think it's a recipe
for cotton candy.
Here we go, everybody.
We've got the wine.
I would like to propose a toast.
To Terrence and Crystal,
may Miami be everything
you think it will.
Anybody home?
Come on in, Angie.
This is pretty.
What is it?
It's from the opera
"Madame Butterfly."
She sounds so sad.
Actually, in this aria,
Butterfly is hopeful
that one day her lover
will return to her.
Does he?
Because of his abandonment,
she kills herself.
You ever see "Avenue Q"?
The musical with the puppets?
That's good theater.
Bree's not here.
What do you want?
I need to talk to her
about some work stuff.
Where is she?
She's out.
That's generally
where Bree is these days.
Out.
She's meeting
with a prospective client,
so she says. She's had
four client meetings this week,
and not one has resulted
in a booking.
Why do you think that is?
It's a rough economy.
I think she's taken a lover.
What? Come on.
No way.
How can you be so sure?
An affair?
Please, the woman makes
her own croutons.
Perhaps.
I have to go away on a golf weekend.
While I'm gone,
could you do me a favor and
keep an eye on Bree?
What do you mean?
Just observe her.
Does she come home at night?
Is anyone with her?
If you wanna be paranoid,
go ahead. It's a free country.
But I am not gonna
spy on your wife for you.
I suppose that's for the best.
If I did find out she was betraying me,
I'd probably do something stupid.
Toughen up. It's just a little dust.
Look, I have to clean that area.
Would you mind having your
breakdown someplace else?
Just leave me alone, okay?
You won, I lost. Isn't that enough?
What?
When you're sitting on the side
of the road picking up
styrofoam and wads of gum,
it's time to admit defeat.
The man I love chose you.
Are you messing with me?
I'm being honest.
Why has this been so hard on me?
You loved him.
I did.
I really did. And now he's gone.
You're an attractive, intelligent woman.
You're gonna meet other guys.
Not like Mike.
We connected
on so many different levels...
Intellectually, emotionally,
sexually.
I've never felt such passion.
Where am I gonna find
another guy who'll
make love to me
five times in one day?
That's a lie.
No, it's not.
Five times?
Susan, come on. Don't tell
me that you and Mike have never...
Maybe I didn't lose after all.
Remind me to ask you what you
want for breakfast more often.
Beats a bowl of oatmeal, doesn't it?
You kidding? That beat a waffle.
I have a crazy idea.
Why don't we both call in sick and
spend the day in bed naked together?
Did I mention naked?
You wanna go for seconds?
What's gotten into you?
Even on my birthday you told me to
hurry up because The Bachelor was on.
Can't a wife just want to
spend time with her husband?
It's just that your timing's bad.
Gotta finish Mr. Hinkle's shower.
I promised him I'd be there yesterday.
I'm serious.
The old man hasn't had a shower in
three days. And that's a long time...
for an old man...
to not take a shower.
The hell with it. He survived
World War II. He'll get through this.
Father Crowley, hi.
This is for you.
I thought I'd catch up on my giving
to my favorite parish.
I certainly didn't expect this.
Well, do with it what you will...
buy a new pipe organ,
help the needy,
take a trip to Tahiti.
I really don't care.
I don't know which nun
you're gonna put my kid with
but make sure she's had
a tetanus shot. Juanita's a biter.
I think you're jumping the gun here.
Why?
A spot opened up. Molly Henderson
is moving to florida, right?
She was. Her father was going to take
a new job but he decided against it.
What? No!
No, this can't be!
I'm afraid it is.
Anyway,
how did you even know about this?
We'll talk about it in confession.
Have faith, Gabrielle. When God
closes a door, He opens a window.
Thank you.
I got the stuff for the mushroom tarts.
How's that cake coming along?
Just when I think I can't
top myself, I do.
How about that?
By the way, Orson thinks
you're having an affair.
He thinks what now?
He thinks you're steppin' out.
But I told him there is no way
Bree Van De Kamp is whoring it up
in some sleazy motel.
Thank you for that.
Sorry to spring it on you like that.
I just felt you should know
what he was saying.
I appreciate it.
I just don't understand
why he would go to you.
Well, he was drinking a lot.
Also, he asked me
if I would spy on you.
Relax, Bree.
Obviously I said no.
And I appreciate that, too.
Would you mind
cleaning this up for me?
Are you sure you're done
topping yourself?
This is serious, Karl. He asked
Angie to spy on me. And...
God knows who else
he has watching me.
I don't think we should
see each other again
until after
you've gotten me a divorce.
Don't ask me how.
You're the lawyer.
Aren't you supposed to be at school?
You never come home for lunch.
I thought I'd try
something different.
Since we're both home, why
don't we go upstairs and make love?
Seriously? You want to do it again?
I just got a sub from Martinelli's.
I am offering you a nooner.
Drop your pants and get upstairs.
Can I bring my sandwich?
Bring it. Grab a pickle. I don't care.
You're the best wife ever.
Can I turn on "The Three Stooges," too?
Lynette, it's Gaby!
In a minute.
Hey, Nanook.
Why you wearing a parka?
Because... Fur is murder.
What's up?
I talked to Crystal Henderson
and she said you talked Terrence
out of going to Miami. Is that true?
I didn't talk him out of it. I merely
pointed out the pros and cons.
Apparently, the cons won.
You've gotta untalk him out of it.
I need him out of this state.
Why?
Are you sleeping with him?
Truth is if he doesn't go, Juanita can't
take his kid's spot at St. Ursula's.
You are unbelievable. You want
this guy to uproot his entire life
just so you can get out
of homeschooling your daughter?
Selfish Gaby. Same old song.
Join in if you know the words.
Sorry, Gaby, I need terrence here.
Why?
Are you sleeping with him?
I just need him here.
Every time I turn around, someone is
trying to make my life more complicated.
Why can't everyone just let it go?
I'm sorry.
Come here.
Everything's gonna be okay.
Why are you getting so upset?
What was that?
What was what?
Your stomach just kicked me.
Open the parka.
I'd rather not.
Open it!
You're pregnant?
Why didn't you tell me?!
Because... I knew you'd tell Carlos.
Yeah, so I tell Carlos.
What's wrong with...
When Carlos offered you
that promotion,
you knew you were pregnant and you knew
you'd be leaving him in the lurch?
Carlos just got this company!
He brought in people he could depend on,
and he thought
he could depend on you!
I didn't tell Carlos
because I knew I was
the best person for the job
and I wanted to prove it.
You certainly proved something.
Wait! Please don't tell Carlos.
I think he should hear it from me.
Better late than never, right?
I'm home! Are you hungry?
Up here!
Hello, lover.
I can't.
I got nothing left. I hit my hand with
a wrench today and when I cried,
only dust came out.
You cried?
That is so sexy.
What is going on with you?
It's like you just got out of prison.
Is there a problem with
a husband and wife having sex?
We have a passionate
relationship, don't we?
Of course we do. It's just,
I was hoping tonight we could...
cuddle.
Cuddle?
Am I that repulsive to you?
What?
It's okay, Mike. You can say it.
I'm a lousy lay.
We had sex three times today.
All right, I can't do it again.
It's not you.
It's basic biology.
Really? Biology? Well,
here is some basic math.
You had sex with Katherine
five times in one day
And me three.
Five minus three equals
Katherine turns you on,
and sex with me is a chore.
You and Katherine
actually talked about this?
More like she rubbed it in my face.
The only reason that
that "record" ever happened
was we got snowed in
during a ski trip.
And we had absolutely nothing
to talk about.
Sex was all we ever had!
Don't you get it?
There was nothing else
to the relationship.
But you and I...
we've got everything.
We have a rich,
full life together.
We could finish
each other's sentences.
"I've been so foolish."
Is that what you were gonna say?
And?
You wanna cuddle.
I was gonna say The Bachelor is on.
But cuddling's good, too.
What are you doing here?
Someone could see you!
Especially if you leave me
standing on your doorstep.
Relax.
I parked two blocks away.
I don't appreciate your taking risks
like this. If Orson find out about...
You won't have that
to worry about much longer.
I found a way to spring you
from this marriage!
Orson's still on parole, right?
For another year. Why?
If he violates parole
by, for instance,
associating with a known felon,
they can revoke it.
And send him back to jail.
All we need to do is get
some ex-con in a room with Orson,
take some pictures, and bam!
He can't touch you
because if he does,
the parole officer will get
the pictures and it's bye-bye, Orson.
That's perfect! And then
he'll have to let me go.
I think someone deserves a kiss.
Karl, we agreed.
For the first time since we've been
together, your husband is out of town.
Do we really want
to let that go to waste?
Come on. Come on!
Do not answer that.
 This is Bree. Please leave a message.
Damn it!
You gotta get that man
out of your bedroom right now!
What? There's no man in my room.
Good, cause it was just about to get a
whole lot more crowded. Orson is home.
You're home early.
Is something wrong?
Why are you back so soon?
I'm coming down with a cold.
You know how I hate to be sick
away from home.
What are you doing?
There are two glasses downstairs
and one has wine.
You are obviously not alone here.
What are you implying?
You know perfectly well
what I'm implying, Bree.
Who was drinking the wine?
Well, first of all, I am insulted
that you would even think that...
Where are you?
There you are!
I pop home for five minutes
to toss some clothes in the dryer,
and you got a man in your bedroom.
You were here tonight?
Just tossin' back a little vino
and gossiping.
This girl knows
everything about everybody.
Is there any wine left?
I could use a glass.
Yes, downstairs on the table.
You go on ahead.
We're gonna finish up our girl talk.
Where are the clothes?
Behind the pillow.
You're gonna have to jump.
There's rose bushes, so
put your pants on first.
I can't thank you enough.
I didn't do this for you.
I did it for Orson.
For Orson?
I told him you had too much
class to do something like this.
I understand your disdain
but this is a complicated situation.
Let me make it simple for you.
Two men want you. Choose one.
But which one? Orson's blackmailing
me to stay with him.
He's manipulative and calculating.
Then go with lover boy.
But what kind of life would I have
with Karl? He's crass and conceited
and the only thing we seem
to have in common is sex.
Then why are you having an affair
with someone you don't even like?
Did I mention the sex?
Karl brings out passion in me
I never knew I had.
I melt every time he touches me.
Great!
Then find a way out of your marriage
and start building a life with this...
Karl.
I would. It's just...
What?
Orson likes opera.
You busy?
So, did... Gaby talk to you
last night?
But I need to talk to you.
I want you to run the Miami office.
What?
If it isn't gonna be Terrence,
then it has to be you.
The future of the company is at stake.
I need my best people on the spot.
It won't be forever, and depending on
how things go after a couple of years,
Maybe you could even move back
and telecommute from here.
Carlos, what is this?
What's what?
Come on, I know,
you know, I'm pregnant.
You're pregnant?
Great.
Please, I know gaby told you.
I would remember somebody
telling me something like that.
So what's your answer?
You send someone else to Miami...
and I stay here.
That's my answer.
Except I need you in Miami,
and I don't need you here.
Not anymore.
Carlos, I am sorry.
I know I should've told you
when I first found out.
Believe me, I wish I had now. But...
You can't fire me
for being pregnant.
I'm not firing you, Lynette.
I'm offering you a promotion.
If you choose to turn it down
and quit instead, I can't stop you.
All I can do is say good luck.
And congratulations.
It's late and
I still gotta close up.
Tomorrow's no good either.
Listen, you're a nice guy.
I'm just not looking
for a relationship right now.
Sorry.
Hello?
I know you girls think that lettin'
a guy down easy, but... trust me,
it ain't.
You okay for now?
I gotta clean up in the back.
Yeah. I'm good.
Agent Padilla?
Little memory quiz for you.
This is Black Owl.
Damn, Chris,
still sharp as a tack, huh?
Don't ask me anything. Don't talk.
This conversation will last
less than 60 seconds.
We both know why.
I'm thinking about comin' in.
You interrupt me again and I hang up.
I said I was thinkin' about it. Now
here's what you need to think about.
I don't care what happens to me,
but I have to know she gets a pass.
There'll be no further discussion
on this until that is firm.
Next time you hear from me,
you'll have an answer to that question
and it better be yes.
You eavesdroppin' on me?
I just got here.
And I wanna go home.
I'll see you.
There is a coffee shop in fairview.
It's known as a place
where you can read
your morning paper...
Where you can meet your friends...
Where you can have a cup of coffee
at the end of a long day.
Yes,
it was a place known
for many things.
Did you forget something?
What are you doing?
But after this night,
it would be known for something...
Far worse.
Previously...
Gaby discovered a secret...
Your stomach just kicked me.
I want you to run the Miami office.
So Carlos played hardball.
You can't fire me for being pregnant.
I'm offering you a promotion.
If you choose to turn it down
and quit instead, I can't stop you.
Katherine broke down.
The man I love chose you. It's over.
Why has this been so hard on me?
You love him.
I found a way to spring
you from this marriage.
Karl made a plan.
If he violates parole by
associating with a known felon,
they can revoke it. All we need to do
is get some ex-con in a room with Orson,
take some pictures,
and it's bye-bye, Orson.
That's perfect! And then
he'll have to let me go.
Nick made a call.
Agent Padilla?
I'm thinking about coming in.
And evil...
Did you forget something?
Returned to the neighborhood.
What are you doing?
Her name was Emily Portsmith,
and word of her death
spread quickly.
You see,
everyone in town knew Emily.
Her family was well known
and respected,
She'd been popular in school...
And her customers
at the coffee shop adored her.
People were shocked
to hear she'd been murdered,
mostly because another
young woman had been attacked
just a few weeks before.
Yes, everyone in Fairview now knew
a killer was walking among them.
And they would soon learn...
He wasn't finished.
Par la Wisteria Team:

The next day,
the women of Wisteria Lane
got together
for their weekly poker game.
But as it turned out,
no one was in the mood to gamble.
The girl at coffee shop was strangled,
and Julie was attacked the same way.
There is a madman on the loose.
I'm afraid to leave my house at night.
At least now, you have
a boyfriend to protect you.
The man threw out his back
peeling an orange. I'm on my own here.
So what do we do
to protect ourselves?
Down at the hospital where I work,
they offer a self-defense class.
Maybe we should consider taking that.
That's a good idea.
I guess we could,
but you know my motto...
38 special is a girl's best friend.
I love the pearl handle.
It would look so good
with my white suit.
Susan, you should feel it.
It's so light.
I don't touch guns anymore, not
since I accidentally grazed Katherine.
Still going with
"accidentally," are we?
We're gonna take a self-defense class.
You wanna come with us?
It might make you feel safer.
I was taking out
the trash when I was attacked.
He came out of nowhere,
and I blacked out before
I knew what was happening.
If someone really wants
to get you, they can get you.
I'm off.
You're sewing Penny's costume?
I'm reading
the sports page while doing it,
so they kinda cancel each other out.
I got you this...
A pricey bourbon.
It's 8:45 in the morning,
and I'm pregnant. I think I'll pass.
For Carlos. It's a "sorry
I lied about being pregnant" gift.
I don't need that.
I know Carlos.
He loses his temper, then
he calms down and thinks rationally.
Good-bye.
I'd still bring the booze.
I'm telling you, I am
too valuable right where I am.
There's no way he's gonna
try and send me to Florida.
What's going on?
Carlos told us about the promotion
in Florida. Congratulations.
You are going to be so missed
around here!
Where you going?
Rita wrote you a good-bye poem.
Can I see you in my office, please?
What do you think you're doing?
You know I'm not moving to Florida.
Then we just change the banner to read,
"good luck and so long."
It needs to read, "I told you I'm
not leaving. Someone get me a bagel."
What can I tell you?
We have an opening for you
in our Florida branch. But here,
your job's already been given to Tim.
Tell Tim you made a mistake.
I can't do that.
I guess this leaves you
no choice but to quit.
I know what you are doing,
and I am not going for it.
You want me gone,
you're gonna have to fire me.
And open myself up to a lawsuit
by firing a pregnant woman?
I don't think so.
Then if you don't mind,
I have work to do.
These aren't my kids.
Those are Tim's kids.
This is his office now.
So...
What office will I be using?
Are you kidding me?
These twins have a bigger office.
Enjoy.
How you doing?
I'm okay.
Everybody think whoever killed Emily
was the same person who attacked me.
That's what the police are saying.
And I think that we should do
everything we can to help them.
Meaning what?
Maybe now is the time to tell them
about the married man you were seeing.
He had nothing to do with it.
You don't know that.
Men who cheat sometimes have
more than one girlfriend.
Mom, listen...
There is no way he could ever
hurt someone, much less kill them.
If you're sure.
I am.
I mean, why would he attack me
and then wanna get back together?
Wait. Have you started
seeing him again?
Even if I did, it is my life, right?
That's right. It is your life.
Is it just me, or was life
much less
complicated when you were 7?
Sorry I grew up.
Me, too.
Police are concerned
that the strangling of Portsmith
is connected to a similar attack
on a Fairview woman
earlier this year.
Anyone with information
is being asked to call...
Just think. If the cops
hadn't wasted so much time on Danny,
they might've caught this guy
before he did this again, right?
What?
I was there.
You were where?
At the coffee shop.
I got there right when
that girl was closing up.
Please be kidding.
I wish I was.
I'm pretty sure
I was her last customer.
But did anybody see you?
No. I don't think so,
but that doesn't mean the cops won't
figure out I was there. If they do...
They're gonna wanna come and talk
to you again and maybe run your prints.
That's what I was thinking.
I was also thinking that maybe
we shouldn't wait for that to happen.
I'm not moving again.
Not this time.
I like this place!
I have friends. I have a job.
I feel like
a real person here again.
After 18 years of being a ghost,
I don't wanna give that up.
Fine.
Maybe we'll get lucky,
and the cops just won't come.
But honestly,
I don't know how much more luck
we got left.
Are you Lamar Benjamin?
You got a warrant?
No. I'm not with the police.
My name is Bree Hodge.
You know my husband Orson
from the state penitentiary.
Do you have a moment?
I got nothing but moments.
So you're Mrs. Hodge?
Damn.
Flossy did okay for hisself.
"Flossy"?
That's what we called Orson
'cause he got us dental floss and
nagged us to use it after every meal.
I see.
Pain in the ass.
I was glad when someone used it to
strangle a guard and they took it all.
How's Orson doing?
To be honest, Lamar,
life on the outside's
been a little hard for him.
People can be so judgmental
about men who have served time.
And if you're a repeat offender,
you can forget it.
I've heard Orson speak very
fondly of his prison friends,
especially you.
Really?
Cause he seemed kinda mad
after I used him as a shield
in that yard fight.
He just tells that story
now and laughs and laughs.
Anyway, he's been feeling
a little blue,
and I was hoping you would pay
him a visit and cheer him up.
Sorry.
I'd be breaking my parole.
They catch me hanging out with other
ex-cons, they can send me back to jail.
Really? That's a silly rule.
Don't worry, though. Our house is
on the end of a very quiet cul-de-sac.
No one would even know
you stopped by.
And, of course,
I would compensate you...
for your time.
And another 3 when you come.
What the hell?
No harm in a little social call.
But you can't tell anybody I came.
When you get to know me better,
you'll find I have no trouble...
keeping secrets.
What are you doing here?
Your mom told me you were upset.
I told her I knew how
to make you feel better.
Mint chocolate chip?
I know this one's gonna take
a lot more than ice cream.
I keep thinking about him.
He's out there, and...
maybe he's thinking about me.
Honey, he's not.
He knows where I live.
He knows what kind of car I drive.
I wanted to go to the library,
but I'm afraid he's gonna follow me.
If you're worried about your car,
why don't we switch for a while?
Seriously? I'd drive your fancy car,
and you'd drive
my tiny, little compact?
There's nothing
I would not do for my little...
You have air conditioning, right?
Yeah, there's nothing I wouldn't
do for my little girl.
You okay?
I'm just having a bad day.
My life has gotten sort of...
complicated.
Why?
It's...
grown-up relationship stuff.
You wouldn't understand.
But...
Since you asked...
So, I think you're really gonna
have fun at Brandon's party.
I heard there's gonna be a pony.
You okay?
I'm worried about Mrs. Mayfair.
Why?
She's not getting any younger,
and it's really hard
to meet guys in this town.
Where did you hear that?
She told me.
She also said
mommy stole you from her,
and that makes mommy a bad person.
Buddy...
your mommy is a great person.
Why don't you...
sign Brandon's card.
And, I'll be right back.
Mike, watch it.
Did you actually tell
my 6-year-old son
that his mother's a bad person?
I would've used
more colorful language,
but like you said, he's only 6.
You've never really
seen me get angry.
But if you want to,
just talk to my son one more time.
Then you'll know
what I'm capable of.
I love MJ, I would never
do anything to hurt him.
One more time.
It's your mother.
Am interrupting anything?
Nope. I'm just at the library.
Really.
The library.
I thought I'd dive
into an old favorite.
And vice versa, I'm sure.
Honey, I don't blame you.
You've gone back to that place
because it seems...
safe and comforting. Am I right?
I guess.
But trust me, it's a bad idea.
Can we talk later? I only have an hour,
and I really wanna finish.
I want you out of there right now!
I'll see you soon.
You bet you will.
You've been a busy girl.
You got the ex-con booked,
hidden cameras all set up.
Come friday night...
Showtime.
What's the matter?
We should be celebrating.
I just hope we're both
clear that these photos
are strictly for blackmail.
Of course. We're not actually
gonna send him to prison.
Unless, I mean, we have to.
Even if he calls our bluff,
we are not gonna turn him in.
Excuse me.
I'm looking for the person that belongs
to the blue car. She's a redhead.
With a man?
She's with a man.
The redhead's my daughter.
Your daughter?
Damn.
You look good.
Thank you.
Can you tell me
what room they're in?
I may not love him anymore, but I'm not
gonna win my freedom by taking away his.
Now you're angry.
When you tell me you could
never hurt a man you used to love,
it doesn't make me angry.
It just reminds me
why I love you so much.
Don't you worry.
No one's gonna get hurt.
Can you tell Carlos I'm here for lunch?
I'm gonna run to the ladies' room.
I'll tell him.
I'd ask you in, but there's enough
oxygen in here for the both of us.
No, it's...
comfy.
I get that Carlos
is trying to punish me.
But enough is enough.
You gotta talk to him.
You never even came to
me to tell me you were pregnant.
This is between you and Carlos.
I know you're upset,
but me keeping my pregnancy
secret wasn't personal.
Wasn't it?
Tom and I are still in debt.
I needed this promotion, and Carlos
had already passed over a coworker
because she was pregnant.
I couldn't risk your telling him.
Because you thought I'd
tell Carlos, and he'd fire you.
So clearly I wasn't enough
of a friend for you to trust me.
But now I'm such a good friend.
I'm the only one who can fix it for you?
I'm guessing you're not gonna
talk to Carlos.
Good guess.
I can't believe she's dead.
I know.
I just saw her a few days ago.
We talked about going to the mall.
Who found her?
The assistant manager.
I was late yesterday.
Thank god.
It would've freaked me out.
We were just talking about Emily.
Yeah, I...
didn't really know her, but...
I guess we're sort of connected now.
You would've liked her.
She was super nice.
I gotta go home. My mom's so
freaked out that this could've been me,
she wants me around.
I'll give you a ride.
We should go, too, Danny.
No, you go ahead.
But... don't you need a ride?
No, I'll walk.
I just wanna talk to Julie.
You wanna get something to eat?
Thanks, but I'm not hungry.
Maybe you wanna
go to Emily's funeral together?
Everybody's going.
I know you like me,
but I can't hang out with you.
Why not?
I just can't.
It's complicated.
It's 'cause you slept
with my dad, isn't it?
Who told you that?
I figured out a while ago.
If you know that, why you still...
Because I like you!
A lot.
Do you not see how weird that is?
It's okay 'cause I've forgiven you.
That's nice,
but it's still weird.
Please, I wanna be with you.
I am so sorry,
but that is never going to happen.
Come on, if they're gonna
come, they're gonna come.
I feel like I spent my entire
life looking out windows.
Maybe it's time we stop.
What are you saying?
I'm saying
maybe it's time
we thought about coming in.
Please tell me
you didn't talk to them.
Calm down. I'm not an idiot.
I used a prepaid, and the call
lasted less than a minute. There's
no way they're ever gonna find us.
They know we're alive!
Don't you wanna know
if they're ready to make a deal?
I killed a man.
They'll be ready to make a deal when
I got a needle in my arm and my eyes
are rolled back in my head!
You don't know that.
You are never talking to them again!
Do you hear me?
I still can't get that image
of Lynette out of my head.
The only thing missing in
that cramped little office
was a hamster wheel and wood chips.
I figure a couple more days of this,
she'll be ready to pack her things.
She does deserve this, right?
She lied when
she took the promotion.
What if her doctor
had put her on bed rest?
What if I needed her
to fly somewhere?
She could've put the
whole company in jeopardy.
Yeah, but that never happened. And
you said she was doing a good job and
now you're doing all
these mean things to her.
Me? This was your idea.
You wanted to put snakes in her office.
Rubber snakes.
We are completely justified here.
You're right.
You're right, which is why
we have the opportunity
to do something
we never do, Carlos...
forgive.
Seriously?
Tom and Lynette have been
our friends for 15 years.
They gave us sausage-of-the-month
last Christmas.
Those were good sausages.
I know Lynette. She would never
set out to intentionally hurt us.
I gotta admit, I do
sort of miss those guys.
You should've seen her when
I was leaving her office.
She had this look in her
eyes. She was so defeated.
You should've seen
this look in her eyes.
It was like,
"screw you Lynette. I win!"
So that's when you called the lawyer?
They're not getting away with this.
They are not gonna harass me.
I am gonna sue their ass! And Carlos
is being served papers tomorrow.
You're really gettin'
worked up here.
We are not having angry sex.
Just thought I'd ask.
What did I tell you about
puttin' away those clothes?
I'm serious. Nap time's over!
Any woman can be the
victim of a violent crime.
That is why it's necessary to
learn how to defend yourself.
A parking lot, a park,
your own driveway.
An attack can happen anywhere.
It only takes a few seconds.
Sorry I'm late. I had
three parties to prep for.
How tiring that must be for you,
juggling all those affairs.
Okay, everyone, team up.
I want an attacker and a victim.
Gaby, you wanna attack me?
I don't wanna hurt you.
Please. I've eaten burgers
bigger than you. Bring it on.
All right, granny.
Prepare to break a hip.
So... looks like we're partners.
Do you wanna attack me?
I could be persuaded.
Now, attackers, I want you
to approach your victim.
Freakishly strong old lady here!
I credit the bran.
That's very impressive.
But the rest of you,
approach your victim from behind.
Place her in a chokehold.
Now, victims, your impulse
will be to pull away. Wrong.
You'll just choke harder.
Instead, I want you to push back on
your attacker, using your weight
to push him off balance.
A little tight.
I'm sorry.
This feels bad, huh?
Being betrayed by someone
you trusted not to hurt you?
What are you talking about?
I know about you and Karl.
Traitor!
Stop it!
You can't talk
your way out of an attack.
Jab with your elbows.
I am trying to!
How could you?! You
know how Karl treated me.
Susan, I am sorry.
If you... Let me explain...
Okay, now,
attacker and victim, switch.
You heard him! Switch!
I am not letting you get behind me!
You've already
stabbed me in the back!
Mrs. Delfino, release your victim.
She is not the victim here!
What about Orson?
How could you do this to him?!
You know nothing about
my marriage to Orson.
He has put me through hell this year!
Bree, too tight!
I know you're angry...
but Karl means more to me
than just a fling,
and I am not giving him up.
So if that means our friendship is over
then that's your decision, not mine.
You're going? We just got started.
I know but I think I've defended
myself enough for one day.
I just got a call from the lawyer. They
are gonna be serving Carlos any minute.
You're really going
through with this, huh?
We're not bad people, are we, Tom?
What Carlos is doing to you
is totally unfair and illegal.
No, we're good people.
Right, he started it. Screw him.
What's all this?
Candy, flowers, baby gift.
Sort of my way of saying, "I'm sorry,
and here's some crap to prove it."
Really?
I don't want to fight anymore,
and neither does Carlos.
I was hoping we could talk.
I am so happy!
Here, take it. It's gettin' heavy.
I missed you!
Honey, we're having a moment
here. Please don't spoil it.
I'm not what's gonna spoil it.
Could you hold on a second?
I'm gonna make a quick phone call.
You know what?
I don't care what happens.
Let's not let anything interfere
with our friendship ever again.
Remember you said that.
Answer the phone. Answer the phone.
What?!
It's Carlos. I wonder what he wants.
You know what you said
about our friendship before?
Let's just make
a pact that we should...
What's up?
I will never forgive you for this.
Gaby, please. What about our pact?
We never made a pact!
Here, MJ, catch.
You have to understand.
I was just protecting myself.
Hello, ladies. What's new?
Lynette's suing Carlos. Here.
Once you apologized, I
tried to call the guy off.
Lynette, you wanted to sue us!
That proves that you are not my friend!
Karen! Here's some candy.
Trying to cut down.
Really? At your age, why bother?
Please, I need to talk to you.
No, you need to talk to my lawyer.
Got a project for you.
Who's this?
Steve Matthews from legal.
You know, since we all seem
to be lawyering up around here.
Look, I was just trying
to protect myself.
It's just business.
This is the department's purchases
and expenses from the last fiscal year.
I'm gonna need all of that itemized...
Done.
By tomorrow morning, 9:00 a.m.
I... hate it when I'm
the only one laughing.
This is at least two days' work.
Not if you work tonight.
Penny's Christmas pageant is tonight.
You know that. You go every year.
Lynette, are you telling me that
you're unable to... What was it again?
Unable to perform the assigned task
in a timely manner.
Yeah, that's it.
Tell your undertaker friend
that I will get the assignment done...
in a timely manner.
Great. And will you tell Penny
Gaby and I
are gonna have to miss her pageant
this year? And we are so sorry.
Thank you both for coming. Before
we get started, can I get you anything?
Given what you're about to do to us,
I'll take a cigarette and a blindfold.
I have decided
to put aside my rage
and sense of betrayal.
I'm here to help you.
Really?
Not you.
If you are actually considering having
a serious relationship with this man,
then I wanna make sure
that you have all the facts.
What kind of facts?
Karl facts.
Tell Bree what you
got me for my 30th birthday.
Who can remember? It was so long ago.
Nothing!
He got me nothing
because he forgot my birthday.
And it wasn't that long ago.
I don't see the point of...
Now tell her where you
spent our tenth anniversary.
I'm sorry. What was that?
A strip club.
That's nothing.
Now tell her what you wanted
for your 35th birthday.
Come on.
He wanted me to ask a friend
to join us in the bedroom.
You kept saying
I was hard to shop for.
There he is, Bree.
That is the man you
say you wanna be with.
Susan, I went into this
with my eyes wide open.
I know who Karl was and
who he sometimes still is, but
I believe him when he says
he wants to change. And...
isn't that what you're supposed to do
when you love someone?
Did you say... "love"?
I think I did.
I have to ask you one question.
Are you drinking again?
Okay, okay, I was just checking.
Well...
if that's really the way you feel,
then you should be with him.
And you have... my blessing.
Really? You can forgive
me just like that?
You know, I was doing a lot of thinking
since, you know, yesterday,
and I realized that...
it's hard to find... love.
And when you do, you should grab it.
And who cares what anybody thinks?
And I really do want you to
be as happy as I am with Mike.
Thank you, Susan.
Don't worry, Susie Q.
I'm going to do right by her.
You really think you can change?
Well, it's easy when you've found
a woman worth changing for.
I didn't mean...
Learned that in self-defense class.
We're taking off.
Wish your little angel luck.
Good luck, sweetie.
Now remember, your dad's
gonna videotape your pageant,
and we're all gonna watch it tomorrow.
Sweetie, I'm sorry. You
know I'd be there, but...
You have to work.
It's okay.
Hey, guys! Wait up!
The doctor's putting him
under observation for 72 hours.
It's standard procedure for...
a suicide attempt.
It's okay, Mona.
Thanks for everything.
My baby...
what were you thinkin', huh?
I'm sorry I called the feds.
I was trying
to make your life easier
after all the things I'd
done to make it harder.
Look what I've done to this kid.
November 10th, 1991.
It rained all day. Remember?
You went to the diner before
we went to meet up with the others.
I had pumpkin pancakes.
You didn't have anything.
I had coffee.
I forget my umbrella in the booth.
And then eight hours later,
neither of us existed anymore.
I had to run,
but you didn't.
You gave up a hell of a lot
just so I wouldn't be alone.
I'd do it again.
I'd do anything for you guys.
I hope you know that.
I do.
Good morning, Lynette. It's 9:00.
Got my reports?
Almost.
So are you telling me
you're not done?
I just need one more hour.
If only I needed them by 10:00.
Unfortunately, I told you
that I needed them by 9:00.
Was I not clear?
You were crystal clear.
It was impossible to get
all this work done in a night.
You knew that when you gave it to me.
Well, it wouldn't have been impossible
if you'd skipped your
daughter's pageant.
I know you went.
Anyway, this is very painful for me,
but I have no other choice
but to terminate your employment.
You're really going to do this?
I believe
I'm within my legal rights.
You need to clear out your personal
belongings within the hour, Mrs. Scavo.
I was up all night on this.
That's a shame.
So Mr. Matthews has some
paperwork for you to sign.
You're gonna regret this.
I'm not gonna go quietly.
I don't care how you go.
I just want you gone.
Good. You're up.
I'm Mona Clarke. I live down
the street from you and your folks.
I told them I would take
real good care of you.
Would you like some juice, Danny?
What?
It's not Danny.
My name's Tyler.
Bye, girls. Thanks for coming.
What are you doing here?
I'm here to pick up MJ.
But she said you couldn't make it.
She was picking him up for you.
Who? Susan?
No, your neighbor Katherine.
What?!
Did I do something wrong?
Hi, daddy.
I drove by Eileen's, and I saw
my little buddy standing out there.
He looked so forlorn.
MJ, go home.
I figured you were late at some job,
so I thought I'd do you a favor.
Now.
What did I tell you?
I needed to talk to him, Mike.
He deserves to know the truth.
His mother lies to him.
He needs to know that what
you and I had was real.
You and I had nothing.
How can you say that?
It's true.
The whole time I was with you,
all I thought about was Susan.
Every time I held you,
every time I kissed you,
all I was thinking was,
God, I wish you were Susan.
If you mean it,
then please kill me.
It would be less painful.
I don't care enough
about you to kill you.
The world is a dangerous place,
and we must learn
to defend ourselves
from those who want to hurt us...
that stranger without a name...
an employer who holds a grudge...
the husband who won't let go.
Yes, we all try to defend ourselves
so we won't get hurt.
I need an ambulance right away.
4356 Wisteria Lane.
Please hurry. I'm losing a lot of blood.
Until the moment we realize...
our pain...
can hurt...
someone else.
Previously
on Desperate Housewives...
Orson's blackmailing me
to stay with him.
To escape her marriage...
Lamar Benjamin? You know my
husband from the penitentiary.
Bree arranged her own blackmail...
I don't want to fight anymore.
While a friendship...
hit the rocks.
You wanted to sue us!
That proves that you are not my friend.
Calm down. I'm not an idiot. I used
a prepaid, they're not gonna find us.
I killed a man.
A desperate act...
led to a revelation.
Would you like some juice, Danny?
My name's Tyler.
The whole time I was with you,
all I thought about was Susan.
And a revelation...
If you mean it, then please kill me.
I don't care enough about you
to kill you.
... led to a desperate act.
I need an ambulance right away.
I'm losing a lot of blood.
Daphne Bicks was an unhappy woman.
And no one knew this better
than her husband.
That's why he hired her
to work with him.
He thought it might cheer her up.
But sadly,
Jeff Bicks soon discovered
that it would take
a lot more than a job...
This coffee's cold.
... to keep his wife
from complaining.
She complained from the moment
they got up in the morning...
Another sleepless night
thanks to your snoring.
... till they were on their
way home at the end of the day.
You want to see if you can
hit all the red lights?
Things had gotten so bad,
Jeff Bicks began to wonder when
God would end his suffering.
Luckily for Jeff,
God had a plan.
You're unbelievable!
You're so cheap.
It's friggin' Christmas,
for God sake.
I'm not buying you a new car.
Tricia Reed's husband got her
a new car. It isn't even a holiday.
He bought it for her
because she beat cancer.
You beat cancer, I'll buy you a car.
Don't beat it, I'll buy you two.
Why are we even together?
The hot sex.
You're cheap, rude.
You lack ambition.
I should just dump your sorry ass.
You want a gift?
How about a divorce?
Don't tempt me.
I'm serious. I already got
the name of a divorce attorney.
You want a divorce?
You got it!
Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus,
and he's giving me my balls back!
Correction... one of them.
I get half of everything.
But not the business. I started that.
With my father's money.
So I get half, and I'm selling it.
Wait a minute.
Let's talk about this.
Now you're scared?
You'd be that vindictive?
Destroy the one thing I love
out of spite?
Hello?! Have we met?
Of course I would.
And I am not stopping there.
Bank accounts, pension funds...
I'm gonna ruin you.
What's the matter?
I can't breathe.
Nice try, big faker.
My chest hurts like hell.
Take the controls.
What?
You gotta land the plane.
What?!
You piece of crap!
You can't do this to me!
And that is how the unhappy marriage
of Jeff and Daphne Bicks ended...
In a plane losing altitude
right above a cul-de-sac...
Is it just me,
or is that plane flying really low?
By the name of Wisteria Lane.
I think it's gonna crash.

The best Christmas ever...
That's what the residents of
Wisteria Lane were dreaming of
as they prepared for
their annual yuletide festival.
So they hung up a banner...
Brought out their candy canes...
And put up Santa's workshop,
as eager as children
for the holiday to begin.
Of course,
some were more childish than others.
Look at this mess.
It's like Santa's colon.
That's funny.
Did you hear that?
Hilarious. Almost as funny
as when Orson said it last year.
How about some Christmas music?
Parker, you got
that sound system fixed?
Almost.
Do we really want the kid
working with electricity?
He can't even get
the newspaper on my porch.
You're clumping.
What is going on with you two?
I don't want to get into it.
Whatever it is, work it out. We are
caroling at the festival on saturday,
and we can't have two of
our jingle belles fighting.
If you need a replacement,
I've been told that I have a dusky alto.
No way!
Girls only. We're the jinglebelles,
not the jingle balls.
Shouldn't you be out stealing
the last can of who hash?
You want to see me
go all Grinch on your ass?
To be honest, I'm not gonna be able
to sing with Lynette after...
after she what?
Are you about to trash me?
I have way too much class to trash you,
no matter how much you deserve it.
Merry Christmas to me.
What did she do?
She's suing Carlos.
You're suing him?
Because he fired me.
He fired her?
Because she lied about being pregnant.
You're pregnant?!
With twins.
You knew?
I told her to keep it quiet.
Congratulations.
Sure, take her side.
She's not!
Stop fighting.
With all we've been through lately...
Julie being attacked,
Danny Bolen's overdose...
We really need
some Christmas spirit around here.
Susan's right.
This is the time
we should come together
and celebrate peace on earth
and good will towards men and...
Crap. Who's dead now?
What's going on?
Something's happened to Katherine.
I was just there five minutes ago.
Was she okay?
She was really upset.
I hope she didn't do
something to herself.
You're not gonna believe this,
but the cops say
that someone stabbed her
right in the gut.
What? Who would do that?
You've got to be kidding me.
Hey there. How you feeling?
A little hungry.
'Cause they pumped your stomach.
But if you want, Tyler,
I can have them bring you some soup.
Why did you just call me that?
You told me to, last night.
No, I didn't.
Yes, you did. Twice.
You were still a little groggy,
but you said your name was Tyler.
Maybe I was dreaming.
My name's Danny.
Can I see my mom?
Please.
Sorry. Not while
you're under observation.
I'll have someone
bring you that soup.
I don't get this. We gave
you a check to cover the ambulance
and everything else.
I know.
But we still need your insurance
information, Mr. Bolen.
It's policy.
Like us not being able to see our kid?
So you have two stupid policies.
There could be
some unforeseen expenses,
tests we may have to run.
If you don't have insurance,
there are government programs.
If you could just
give me your information...
We don't need a handout.
We have cash.
Thank you, though.
Gayle.
Can I speak with them?
I know what's going on.
What do you mean?
I knew something was up the
moment you moved onto the Lane.
You never talk about your past.
We're private people.
Is there a law against that?
Having no insurance, wanting to
pay cash for everything,
having a son who can't rember
if his name is Danny or Tyler...
Where you going with all this, Mona?
You're in the witness protection
program, aren't you?
You are one sharp cookie.
How'd you figure it out?
Honestly?
Once I noticed you were Italian,
I just kinda went from there.
No offense.
None taken.
I can't believe I'm right.
So... What went down?
You witness a hit?
Did you rat on
one of the five families?
We can't talk about it.
And neither can you,
to anybody.
Of course not.
Because if you do say anything...
We're gonna have to
have you whacked.
Any more news
about Mike and Katherine?
No. But I'm sure
he'll be exonerated.
Mike could never
do something that awful.
That's my Bree... always seeing
the good in people.
Forgive me for starting your day
on a sour note,
but I filed for divorce.
Here are the papers.
And if you try to stop me,
your parole officer will see these.
Consorting with a known felon
is a parole violation.
If you send me to jail for fraud,
you're going with me.
It's over, Orson.
This must have been
quite a project for you...
Finding Lamar,
setting up the camera.
Sorry to put you through
so much needless trouble.
I would hardly say needless.
Without these, you'd still
have a gun to my head.
Do you really think
I would send you to jail?
It's what you've been threatening.
I was bluffing, Bree,
right from the start.
I could never hurt you
that badly, no matter what.
You didn't need these.
You could've called my bluff
and walked away anytime.
The fact that you did believe me,
that you thought I'd destroy you
just out of spite, that alone
should've told me it was over.
I will pack after breakfast.
For what it's worth,
I'm sorry it had to end this way.
Me, too.
These scones you made are delicious.
I'll miss them.
Here's Katherine's room.
You might hear some screams for help.
Ignore them.
Is that what you meant by,
"I'll behave calmly and rationally"?
That was just to get
you to unlock the car door.
You gotta be Katherine Mayfair's best
friend, 'cause she could put Mike away
for a very long time.
I know.
Might help if you give her these.
Good idea.
She pisses me off, I can
crack the vase over her head.
No, Dylan. The police have
everything under control.
There's no reason for you
to fly out here.
Honey, I've got a visitor.
I gotta go.
Talk to you later.
Come in.
What a sweet gift.
I didn't even think
I'd see you here.
I was concerned
about you, Katherine.
A lot of people are.
Actually, the one they should
be concerned about is you.
Why is that?
Because the man you just
married turned out to be a maniac.
About that...
We both know...
That Mike didn't do this.
Really?
I've got seven stitches and
a knife with Mike's fingerprints
that say otherwise.
It doesn't make...
anysense.
Why would Mike want to stab you?
If you must know...
I told him I was in love
with someone else,
and he flew into a rage.
Will you stop lying?
If you don't tell the truth soon,
you are sending an innocent man to jail.
You are taking a father
away from his son.
It's Mike's fault, not mine.
Katherine, please!
Even though I am so angry with him,
when you think about it,
it's really kind of flattering...
To go this far to keep me
from being with someone else.
How did it go?
I don't know anymore.
I can't tell if she's crazy
or just devious.
A little of both.
Tell me how I get
the crazy part committed.
Only a family member can
commit somebody to an institution.
Really?
Excuse me.
I was just with
my friend Katherine in 607,
and she was talking
to her daughter, and she
wanted me to follow up about
something. Do you have that number?
Dylan Mayfair?
Would you mind dialing that number?
Certainly.
There you go.
This is Dr. Brewster calling
from Fairview General.
I understand that you were
just speaking with your mother.
Right.
I do feel, given her condition,
it is important for you
to come here if you can.
Lovely.
See you soon.
That's devious.
50 cents off paper towels...
That's a great coupon.
This is fun.
It sure is.
And me doing my own roots
is gonna be fun,
and getting rid of cable.
We're gonna be having
so much fun around here.
Mommy?
Are we poor?
Only financially.
Don't forget that one.
Ravioli in a can?
I like poor food!
What'd they say?
I've attended classes for six weeks.
They won't refund any of my tuition.
Unbelievable.
Is there a sign over us
that says "crap here"?
It'll be okay. I'm looking for a job,
and in the meantime,
we got enough money live on
for the next... four months?
So we'll run out right before
the babies are born.
Yes, but remember,
kids don't miss what they never had.
Like food, clothing, sober mother?
I am so sorry.
For what?
For what I have done to this family.
You have to drop out of school.
Penny is clipping coupons.
I have really screwed this up.
We'll get some money
if we win the lawsuit.
Won't that be great?
Living off the money we made
suing our best friends.
At least Gaby tried
to apologize and stop this.
Maybe it's your turn.
Damn it!
Whatever it is, I can explain.
That was the chairman of my board. This
Lynette thing is turning into a fiasco.
That lawyer said you did everything
by the book, that we were covered.
It doesn't matter what he said.
Bottom line is, it looks bad
for global venture...
Big corporation going after
a pregnant woman.
What's gonna happen?
If this suit goes to trial...
I'm done.
And even if it doesn't,
I might still lose my job.
I've put everything
into this company.
I know I'm probably the
last person you want to talk to.
You got that right.
It's done, Karl.
Orson signed the papers.
I know.
I've never been happier.
I absolutely want to see you, too.
Meet me at the motel,
and we'll find a way to celebrate.
Till then, my darling.
When you move on,
you don't waste any time.
I'm sorry.
I wanted to tell you this morning,
but I felt I'd hurt you
enough for one day.
Much better to parcel out the pain.
Is it someone I know?
Never mind.
I can't handle that right now.
Just tell me this...
Have you told your friends
you're seeing anyone?
Of course not.
Good.
Please don't until I'm gone.
I'm saying good-bye to everyone
at the party tomorrow.
I don't want it to turn into
a pity fest for poor Orson.
I won't go public with my new
relationship until we're divorced.
And I'll say we started
seeing each other...
After you and I separate.
What a tasteful solution.
You must write an etiquette book
for adulterers.
I don't blame you for being angry.
And I give you my word, I will not let
my affair be an embarrassment to you.
So when the plane flies over
the christmas party,
I want it pulling
a big-ass banner that reads,
"Will you marry me, Bree?
Love, Karl."
Isn't that romantic?
Glorious. That'll be 600 bucks.
I don't care.
You can't put a price on love.
He can. Our anniversary?
$20 gift certificate to a rib joint.
You didn't have to cook that night.
So the gift was for both of us.
Good luck, Mr. Mayer.
I hope this Bree says yes...
Almost as much as I wish
I had said no.
For what it's worth,
i'm a divorce lawyer.
For God sake!
Jeff, look at the mess in here!
Do you have a card?
I have nothing to say to you.
I know what your mother
must have told you.
It's what she told everyone.
But it's not true.
Do you really think I'm gonna
take your word over hers?
I am so worried about your mom.
I am not just thinking about Mike.
The hell you're not. Get over him.
He's married to my mother.
What?
You know, it's bad enough that
you make a scene at their wedding
and you hound them night and day.
And you stab her
because you can't have him?
Is that what she told you?
I don't know why you're not
locked up right now. You're crazy.
We need to talk.
I don't understand.
For months, my mom has been
telling me about her life with Mike...
The gifts that he's given her
and trips that they've planned.
Your mom needs help.
And so does Mike.
What do you want me to do?
Good news.
Dr. Cheng says I can give your
parents an early christmas present.
You're released. Grab your stuff.
I'm taking you home.
Thanks for the ride.
Happy to help.
I can't imagine how tough it is
for you guys to live this way.
What way?
Running all these years,
always looking over your shoulder.
Relax, Danny. Your parents
told me about your situation.
Well, actually, I figured it out.
Your mom just filled in the details.
Why would she do that?
Frankly, I think she was glad
to finally find someone
she could be honest with.
And that goes for you, too.
If you ever need to talk,
you can trust me.
I hope so.
Cause if you say anything,
they're gonna throw my mom in jail.
It doesn't work that way.
Are you kidding?
Ever since 9/11, the feds
are hard-core on any terrorist stuff,
even the old cases.
If they find her, she's dead.
What do you mean?
I thought we were
picking you up tomorrow.
Ma, I screwed up.
What are you talking about?
I told Mona everything.
Thanks for giving Danny a ride.
I am so sorry he dragged you
into our family drama.
I mean, you know better than anyone
what a bad head space he's in right now.
He's so angry at me and his dad,
he just wants to hurt us,
which would explain
the wild story he just told you.
So...
We good?
I hate my job.
All I do is deal with
disturbed people,
wipe their drool, strap them down.
I hate it.
Well...
Maybe you should get a different job.
I wanted to,
but they say you should have
a year's worth of living expenses.
And I didn't know
where I'd get the money.
$67,000.
That's what I've needed
to cover my mortgage,
my car, everything for a year.
67 grand.
If you could do that for me,
then we'd all be free.
What are you doing here?
I asked you not to come.
I had to.
You were hurt.
Have you been to the house?
I'm so sorry Mike
wasn't there to welcome you.
He's away on business.
No, he's in jail.
You told the police he stabbed you.
I... never said that.
I told you...
Susan attacked me.
Then why did the police arrest Mike?
I don't know.
Maybe he confessed to protect her.
Susan's his wife.
That's ridiculous.
Who told you that? Susan?
They let me speak with him.
Mom, Mike is in jail, and that's
not right if he didn't do anything.
Did you stab yourself?
Mom, did you?
I asked you not to come.
You don't understand.
Susan trapped him,
filled his head with lies.
This is gonna save him.
He knows why I did it.
He wants this.
What is she doing here?
I wanna help you, Katherine.
I have to get to Mike.
He's expecting me.
I can fix it. You'll see!
I have to go!
We need a little help here.
Everything's gonna be wonderful!
I have to get to Mike!
We need some help here!
Get your hands off of me!
Mrs. Mayfair, please!
Please, Mrs. Mayfair,
we're trying to help you.
It's okay. Honey,
everything's gonna be okay.
I asked you not to come.
Wait up. I wanna go with you.
Can't I have one moment of peace?
Our therapist said we need
to do more stuff together.
I know. That's why I don't go
to the therapist with you.
Would it kill you to spend
some time with the woman you love?
I don't know.
Would you be upset if I brought her?
As long as she doesn't
deflate in the plane.
Gaby, please talk to me.
I feel just awful.
You know why? Because you are
awful. You're an awful person.
You have every right to be mad at me.
Thanks, Lynette,
and you have every right
to go to hell. Stop talking to me!
Thank you, all, for coming out
to our annual holiday festival.
And, as it's been our tradition
these last 12 years,
please welcome back
the Jingle Belles.
All right, ladies. Sparkle!
I can't believe they wouldn't
let you sing with them.
It's their group. They can do
whatever they want. Whores.
Do you mind? You're blocking me
with yourbig fat head.
I thought we weren't talking.
You know, I was trying to apologize.
It's too late. Carlos is probably
gonna lose his job over this stuff
you're putting him through.
Gee, I wonder what that feels like.
By the way, because your husband
canned me, Tom had to quit school.
The 45-year-old freshman
has to drop out?
Maybe he'll get a paper route. Move!
Fine. You want to be a jerk?
Gaby give me my hat back.
Gaby, give me my hat back!
Give that back to me!
Give me my hat back!
Gaby, give it back!
All is calm! All is calm!
She's the one who started it!
She's being a bitch.
I don't remember the word "bitch"
being in the song.
It's always been there.
We are going to take
a little... break mid-song,
and we will be right back.
Have a little punch.
I realize you two are having
a problem... a giant problem.
And now half of Fairview does, too.
So, A, you're fired,
and B, work it out.
Gaby, I'm sorry about everything,
but you have no idea what losing
my job has done to my family.
Why don't you slip your cankles
into my shoes and walk a mile?
You just don't care
about anyone but yourself.
No, I do.
I care about my friends.
Sorry you are no longer
a part of that group.
I'm in. It's a christmas miracle!
We can't just let some stupid housewife
shake us down for 67 grand.
What do you want from me?
We gotta try to make this go away.
We got the emergency 10 grand,
but that is a long way from $67,000.
Maybe this'll get us closer.
You little... Now do be careful,
you little munchkins.
Excuse me.
What are you doing here?
I just thought I'd come by and
give you an early christmas present.
Stop it! We can't be seen together.
What's the big deal? Susan knows.
The cat's out of the bag.
Orson doesn't know.
You didn't tell him?
About the affair, yes.
But he has no idea it's you.
Now, Karl, please go.
I promised him
there'd be no scenes today.
Just came by to check
on the decorations.
Great job, Mrs. Hodge.
Save it, Karl. I'm not an idiot.
You obviously heard
Bree and I are divorcing, and
vulture that you are, you've swooped in
to make a buck by representing Bree.
A man's gotta eat.
Perhaps.
But soliciting business
at a christmas party?
That's tacky, even for you, Karl.
If this is who you want
representing you, that's your choice.
But frankly, I thought
you hahigher standards.
Remind me not to let him
make a toast at our wedding.
It's not funny, Karl. Now just go
before he figures it out.
Yeah, about that... You know that
christmas present I mentioned?
Don't you dare give me a present
in front of all these people!
I'm not sure I can stop it.
It's being delivered... by air.
What did you do?
Just let me make one quick call.
How do you turn this thing on?
Somebody help!
I don't know how to fly!
I released the banner. Now what?
Look for a place to land...
A field, a large parking lot.
All I see are neighborhoods.
Negative. Street landing
is too dangerous.
That's all there is!
What do you want from me?!
Okay, calm down.
Keep her steady.
Jeff, it's Karl.
Are you there?
Come on, pick up.
If you get this message,
and please, please get this message...
you need to abort.
Do not, repeat, do not fly over
Wisteria park with that banner.
What banner?
Call me.
What banner?
You know how you're always saying
to me I should be more romantic?
Well, I thought, what if I hire
a plane to fly over Bree's street
carrying a banner with
a heartfelt personal message?
When you put a message on a banner,
it ceases to be personal.
What does it say?
Something like...
"Bree, will you marry me?
Love Karl."
I was trying to be romantic.
When we began this affair,
we agreed to be discreet.
Do you know what discreet means?
No skywriting!
Poor Orson!
Do you know how humiliated he'll be?
I have to warn him.
Bree, wait.
I made this mess.
I'll deal with it.
Orson deserves the truth,
and he should hear it from me,
not a banner.
You got a minute?
I need to talk to you.
What, here? Can't it wait?
Not really.
If this is about the settlement,
I told Bree there's very little I want.
That's not the problem.
It's what I want...
You're too late.
She has a boyfriend.
You?
If I were a betting man,
I've lost a bundle on this, too.
So... wait...
You're having sex with my wife?
The point is, we don't wanna make this
any harder for you than it has to be.
I just wanted to warn you
that in a few minutes...
Okay, you're the husband.
I'll give you that one.
I'm trying to spare
your feelings, which is why...
That's it.
The hell with your feelings.
I am proposing to Bree today
with an airplane banner.
And trust me, that will be
the highlight of your day!
One moment, please.
Have you been to see Santa yet?
You want me to take you?
Come on. I will take you
to see Santa.
We're gonna do this
right here? Just like that?
This seems like a pretty small
envelope for such a big secret.
It's 10 grand. And my wedding ring.
It was my grandmother's.
It's all we have right now.
But...
I gave notice at the hospital.
I can't go back there.
That's the best we can do.
I have a job at Bree's.
I could pay the rest as I make it.
Sure, until you disappear
into thin air.
Just because I have lawn gnomes
doesn't mean I'm stupid.
You don't know the whole story.
I know you killed someone
and walked away scot-free.
Scot-free?
Does this look scot-free?
I don't think Danny
told you the whole story,
but maybe you should hear it.
4 miles I ran today,
and now I'm drinking eggnog.
It's like mayonnaise with rum in it.
Excuse me.
What are you doing?! Stop it!
This is ridiculous! Please!
For God sakes, stop it!
And that was 18 years ago and we've been
looking over our shoulders ever since.
That sounds like
a very reasonable story...
So reasonable that I don't understand
why you couldn't just
call the police right now
and explain it to them.
Someone's dead.
You know I can't do that.
What I know is you've got till tomorrow
to come up with the rest of the money,
or I go to the police.
Capisce?
Is it just me,
or is that plane flying reallylow?
Can we talk about this?
Don't do this.
You are screwing with people's lives
here. This could blow up in your face.
$67,000 by tomorrow
or I call the police.
House. House. House!
We're not done here.
You can run, but you can't hide!
Run!
The best christmas ever...
That's what everyone had wanted.
But something went wrong...
Horribly wrong.
For those who survived,
it would be a day
they would try to forget.
For those who didn't,
this christmas would simply be...
Their last.
Previously...
A friendship was torn apart.
I care about my friends. Sorry you're
no longer a part of that group.
I need to talk to you.
What? Here?
Bree's affair was revealed to Orson.
Mona threatened Angie.
You've got till tomorrow
to get the money, or I go to the police.
And then tragedy struck.
I'm at the site of a bizarre
accident that happened just hours...
If you watch the news tonight,
you will be told all about a tragedy
that occurred
on a quiet suburban street.
You will hear eyewitness
accounts of the crash.
You will learn the extent
of the damage.
But the news can't tell you
who survived.
Because no one yet knows...
For sure.
Thank God, you're here.
I was on my way home.
I got this text from Julie.
She said a plane crashed onto the lane?
A single-engine plane that
had to make an emergency landing.
The pilot had a heart attack.
Karl was taken away in an ambulance?
Yeah. He's in surgery.
How bad is it?
He's gonna make it, right?
There was a lot of bleeding.
Doctors are doing the best they can.
You want to sit down?
Here. Have a seat.
Was anyone else hurt?
Orson... And Mona Clarke.
They're still in surgery.
Bree got a little banged up,
but nurse says she's gonna be okay.
And Celia might have a concussion.
What happened?
The plane was headed straight for her,
and Lynette pushed her
out of the way. You saved her life.
You would've done the same
thing for my kids. It's no big deal.
No, Lynette, we owe you everything.
So what do we do now?
I guess we just wait and pray.
I think that's a really good idea.
Are you okay?
I don't know.
I have this terrible pain.
The truth is,
no one knows who survived
that tragic plane crash...
I think there's something wrong
with the babies.
Or more importantly, who didn't.
Par la Wisteria Team:

Any word about Karl?
Still in surgery.
I feel like such a hypocrite.
After that guy cheated on you,
I hated his guts.
Never spoke to him again.
And I was just in the chapel
praying for him.
I know what you mean.
It's pretty complicated for me, too.
With that,
Susan began to think
of her marriage Karl...
How wonderfully it had started...
How they'd been so happy...
Until the day Susan found lipstick
where she shouldn't have.
Susan then thought of the day
she told Karl to leave,
and she wondered...
What if she hadn't?
Wait! Don't go.
You just kicked me out.
I know.
I put 12 years of my life
into this marriage,
and we have a daughter.
We owe it to Julie
to try to work this out.
Don't touch me.
You're still a pig.
If we are gonna put this behind us,
I need to know about everyone that
you've been with since we were married.
Everyone?
I don't think this is a good idea.
I don't want to be wondering,
when we go to a party or a restaurant,
"Did he sleep with her?
Her? Her?"
You found out about Brandy.
Yes.
It was nice to put the panties
with a face.
Go on.
Before her...
Let's see...
It was Amber,
the dental hygienist...
Kwan Lee, the massage lady...
Remember
when we had cable installed,
and you wondered why we got
so many channels for free?
You know what?
Maybe you were right.
It's good to have some secrets.
Why don't you just go
upstairs and unpack your stuff?
I will learn how to swallow my rage.
You are not gonna regret this.
Hey there. I'm Mike Delfino.
We met at Mary Alice's funeral.
Your husband told me
you have a clogged sink.
Come on in.
So how you liking
the neighborhood so far?
I like it.
It seems quiet...
Friendly.
It is. And safe.
I bet we have the lowest
crime rate in America.
You need to get that?
Let the machine get it.
Hi. It's Susan and Karl.
Leave us a message.
Suse. It's me.
I'm gonna be working late.
Don't hold dinner for me.
The switchboard's gonna be closed,
so don't bother calling.
Love ya.
He's screwing his secretary.
My husband.
Thinks he's fooling me.
He's not.
I'm sorry.
You know,
what would serve him right...
To come home
and find me in bed with another man.
I gotta go.
What's the rush?
I've got to
get a part at the hardware store.
And they close at 6:00.
Am I that undesirable?
No, you're very desirable,
in a big way.
Did you just call me fat?
I think you're very beautiful.
It's just...
You're married.
Right.
I'm sorry.
If you're unhappy,
you should do something about it.
Please.
Not another business trip.
Please.
Let it be another business trip.
I tried.
I'm sorry.
That's it?
15 years of marriage,
and that's all I get,
two lousy sentences?
I don't know what else to say.
How about...
"Hey, Susan,
"thanks for eating nothing
but broccoli and colon cleanser
"for the last six months so you
could lose weight and look good for me"?
Or, "Hey, Susan,
thanks for wasting the best
years of your life while I went out
and banged everything with
a GED and a tramp stamp."
I'm sorry, okay?
But you could've
spared yourself all this pain
if you'd just let me go
the first time.
You really do deserve better, Susan.
Mrs. Delfino?
Karl didn't make it.
Oh, my God.
If there's anything you need,
we have counselors available.
I'll be fine.
Thank you.
I can't imagine
what you must be feeling.
Mostly...
I'm feeling grateful.
Bree Hodge was told about
the death of Karl Mayer
at 6:12 that evening.
She became so hysterical
she had to be sedated by 6:18.
It wasn't long
before she fell asleep.
And then she began to dream...
A dream about what
her life would have been like
if Karl hadn't died.
You are so corny!
No deviating from the marriage playbook.
I'm doing it right this time.
Happy?
You've made me happy
in ways I couldn't even imagine.
If it wouldn't be too much trouble,
would you mind pulling down my zipper
with your teeth
and taking me on the table?
What is it with you women
once you get a ring on?
And if you're a stickler for tradition,
we could always
take it up to our bedroom.
Our bedroom...
I like the sound of that.
Get used to it... Because it's
going to be our bedroom for a long,
long time.
I meant what I said when I proposed.
Being with you is gonna make me
into a whole different man.
I hope not completely different.
I don't ever want to lose
that sexy beast
who swept me off my feet.
Trust me.
He's not going anywhere.
Honey, that was fantastic.
Oh, my God.
You're supposed to be
catering a wedding.
Yes, clearly this is my fault.
Courtney?
I'm so sorry, Bree.
Really, Karl, my yoga instructor?
No charge for next month.
Like I'm keeping you!
Get the hell out of my house.
She's going.
I'm not talking to her!
How could you, Karl?
In our own bed?
You're right.
That was tacky.
I am so sorry.
I'll call you.
What?
Sorry. Force of habit.
This thing doesn't have to
mean any more than we decide it does.
You made a vow to me.
Why did I think I could change you?
I know.
You thought you could turn me
into your personal lapdog, like Orson.
You leave Orson out of this.
Why?
I haven't done a thing to
you that you didn't do to him.
Get out of my house!
The truth hurts, doesn't it?
Get out.
I didn't know who else to call.
You were his emergency contact.
I'm just a little surprised.
Orson and I hadn't spoken
in nearly ten years.
Are you sure there wasn't someone
else in his life? A girlfriend maybe?
Never saw one.
In fact, in seven years he lived here,
I never saw anybody visit him at all.
Where did you... find him?
In the bed.
Paramedics said it was a heart attack.
He'd been there two days.
Can you imagine?
Just like that, you're gone,
and no one notices?
Poor Orson.
Take whatever you want.
I'll have goodwill pick up the rest.
You know, he spoke about you
constantly.
It was always "Bree this,"
"Bree that."
It was almost like he died of...
What? Say it.
Like he died of a broken heart.
I just wanted to tell you
your husband's out of danger.
Thank God for that.
But there were some complications.
What kind of complications?
This is a preliminary assessment,
but it seems there has been some
damage to his spinal column.
What does that mean exactly?
There's a good chance
your husband is paralyzed.
Excuse me. Can you tell me
anything about Mona Clarke's condition?
The doctors, they did everything
they could, but that woman...
I mean, she was hit by a plane.
Now all we can do is wait
and hope that she pulls through.
Pulls through?
Yes. Your friend's a real fighter.
She's hanging in there.
How? She got hit by a plane!
The doctors couldn't believe it either.
I don't know if you're religious but,
now would be the time to pray.
Believe me, we will.
Dear God, please take that
blackmailing bitch home now.
A freaking plane hit her.
What is it gonna take, a silver bullet?
I'm gonna go home, pack up our stuff.
You stay here.
If they pry the propeller out of
her mouth and she starts yapping,
get the hell outta here.
Just like that,
Angie Bolen began to consider
what was happening.
She thought of the doctors
trying to save Mona
and how long it might take her
to recover.
Then she imagined Mona waking up...
and telling the police
everything she knew.
And Angie asked herself,
what would happen
if Mona Clarke lived?
How about a little lunch,
Ms. De Luca?
Eggplant parm.
It's not like the place you used to go
into on east 10th street, but not bad.
I want to see Nick.
He's a little busy.
I just want to talk to him
for a couple minutes.
As far as the bureau is concerned,
Nick is a traitor.
Get used to it. You're never gonna
talk to him again.
What about Danny?
Tyler is with your mother.
But enough about what you want.
Here's what I want...
Patrick Logan.
You need to be thinking
real clear right now.
We know Logan ran everything, but
without him, it's all gonna fall on you.
I don't know where he is. I
haven't spoken to him since that night.
You've been on the run 18 years,
and you and your former lover
don't even exchange a phone call?
Don't take this personally,
agent Padilla,
but you weren't the ones
I was running from.
I know Logan.
I know how scary he is.
But I think the situation
you're in now...
is worse.
Then you don't know how scary he is.
Federal sentencing guidelines
dictate the punishment in this case.
There's no room for leniency
from the court.
That being said, Miss De Luca,
you would like to address the court.
Thank you, your honor.
No one...
Was supposed to get hurt.
We believed in something, and we wanted
to make other people believe in it, too.
But someone did get hurt.
A man died.
I read every newspaper article
about your husband,
about Sean.
How he coached little league,
that the whole neighborhood
came to his funeral.
I never lived in a world
like that...
until we moved to Fairview.
I never felt like
a part of a community,
which...
made it so much clearer to me
how horrible it is
that I brought so much pain to yours.
Please rise for sentencing.
Angela De Luca, you are hereby
sentenced to life imprisonment
without the possibility of parole.
Marshals, remand the prisoner
to custody.
So... How is she?
I'm so sorry.
She didn't make it.
I know how upset you must be.
Please don't be angry with God
because your prayers weren't answered.
Don't worry about it, hon.
Me and God are good.
I spoke with the doctor.
They are goingo keep her
overnight for observation.
I thought they said she was fine.
They're just being
extra cautious. That's all.
Look at her.
I feel bad even saying it,
with everything
that's happened but...
we really lucked out, huh?
I don't think it was luck.
I think it was God.
Actually, it was Lynette.
Lynette was his instrument.
Either way, it was a hell of a tune.
I'm serious.
I think God saved Celia
because she's special.
She has a gift.
What kind of gift?
I'm not sure yet.
But she has one.
I know she's gonna do
something amazing with her life.
Fine.
While you figure out
how our daughter's gonna change
the world, I'm going to the cafeteria.
See you in a few.
As she lay there,
Gabrielle began to think of ways
her daughter could shine.
She thought of music...
And sports...
And other creative pastimes.
And before she drifted off to sleep,
Gabrielle wondered,
what if her daughter was destined
to be a great actress?
Celia Solis. How old are you?
Five. It's our first audition.
We're very excited.
Well, great. Such a cutie,
just what we're looking for.
She can be cuter. Show him honey.
Good girl.
This is a... Here. This is a commercial
for Ouch Away! Bandages.
Stand right there on the T.
You just got a boo-boo
on your finger.
You're gonna hold it up,
look real sad and cry, okay?
And go.
No. Don't smile, honey.
We need you to cry.
Let's try it again.
Thank you... Thank you very much.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
You gotta give her
another shot. Please.
I love the look, but can I be honest
with you, mom? The side dish that came
with my lunch has more talent.
What are you saying?
I'm saying she's not as good
as coleslaw. Deal with it.
That little girl is here for a reason.
She is going to inspire people,
and you are gonna be part of that!
All right. Well, hurry up.
All right.
I got you another chance.
Can you cry for mommy?
Sure you can.
When that nice casting man
asks you to hold up a finger,
just hold it up and cry.
How easy is that?
Hello?
What?
Oh, my God.
Daddy fell and hurt himself.
I don't think he's gonna make it.
And... when he fell,
he landed on...
your hamster cage
and crushed Mr. McFuzz.
He is dead. Mr. McFuzz is dead.
Roll it.
Gaby, I'm going to take Celia
for an ice cream!
Be back in a bit!
The bus for camp
leaves in 20 minutes.
But what about my auditions?
Mommy's gonna kill us.
Let me handle mommy.
You need a sleeping bag
to get ice cream?
Run!
Leave it. Leave it! Leave it!
What the hell are
you doing? We talked about this.
No summer camp.
She's got auditions.
You have got her living
in this weird little bubble,
and she needs to be
around kids her own age.
She will be. I'm taking her
to a casting call for "Annie".
Why can't you support her career?
Celia, will you wait
in the car, please?
Thank you, sweetie.
Because she stinks.
That little girl is destined for
greatness. That is why God saved her.
God does not save people who stink.
Maybe God saved her so that
she could go to camp and
make some friends
and have a normal childhood!
Who would believe
in a God like that?
Gaby, she's miserable.
No, she's not. She wants this.
No, she does it to please you!
That is a horrible thing to say.
I am not hurting her.
In fact, making her shine
is my life's work.
All I want is for people to
understand how special she is.
Get in the house!
Celia wait.
I'm sorry, but you have
clearly lost your mind,
and I'm not gonna stand here and
watch you ruin our daughter's childhood.
If you don't like it, leave.
Gaby, be careful what you say,
because I am very close to going.
See ya. Come on.
Let's go get ready for your audition.
You're gonna be the best annie ever.
There you go, sweetie.
All better.
Ouch Away!, adhesive bandages...
They heal with a mother's love.
Look at that face. That's a star.
You're not watching this again.
Now please,
help me with the groceries.
Did you get my wrinkle cream?
You can't buy stuff like that
with food stamps.
I know. I just wish you loved me
enough to steal it.
Jerry, sweetie.
Honey, it's your agent.
Celia's dying to work.
What do you got for us?
Come on. There's gotta be something.
No, no. She's not too old.
She can pass for 15.
Hell, I'm looking at her
right now. Okay, we'll be there.
Baby, we've got an audition.
And we gotta get that hair
into pigtails.
I think we need to talk.
What did I dowith those ace bandages?
We gotta flatten you down.
Listen to me.
I don't want to be an actress.
What? You can't quit. You're...
I'm special. This is my destiny.
It's why I was spared.
You spent the last 20 years
telling me I'm meant for big things.
And you are.
I'm not special. I'm normal.
And I just want to have
a normal life.
Get married, have kids.
And there's gonna be
plenty of time for that.
You always say that.
Why can't you admit it's over?
Because if we give up,
then everything I've worked for
is for nothing.
Your father walked out.
Your sister never calls.
This is all I have.
What time's the audition?
Tomorrow, 3:00.
Now let's do something
about this hair.
Honey, this is the one. I feel it.
One day you're gonna thank me.
I brought you coffee.
So have you figured out what our
4-year-old is gonna do with her life?
But I did figure out what
she has to do to be special.
What's that?
Absolutely nothing.
How could this happen? I know
I fell, but I felt fine afterwards.
It doesn't take much to cause
a tear to the placenta.
But you said the one baby is fine?
But if we don't operate
on the other one, there could be
a decrease
in blood flow to the brain,
which could put the child
at risk developmentally.
At risk how? Physically? Mentally?
Right now
there's no way to know.
How soon can we do the surgery?
We're ready to go. Let's get her in.
At that moment,
Lynette began to think of
the baby she had yet to meet.
She thought of what it would
be like to hold him,
how it would feel to look
into his eyes...
and to kiss his tiny hand.
And then
Lynette thought of what would
happen if the doctor told her
that same beautiful child
was disabled.
He especially hates
the hamstring stretches.
Well, and obviously it's hard
to hear him cry,
but you really need to tune it out,
because without the therapy,
his muscle tone will...
You try. Maybe it's me.
Sometimes it helps to sing to them.
I do that.
He loves it when I do that.
And the sailor said, "Brandy,
you're a fine girl"
what a good wife you would be".
Why don't we take a break?
Maybe we should take some time
and talk about where we're at.
Where we're at is we haven't seen
any milestones since august.
Not since he finally started
grabbing his feet.
But that was a big one.
Definitely.
But he should be sitting
by now, right?
Or pulling to stand or crawling.
If you worry too much about what
he suld be able to do by now
or what other kids his age are doing,
it's gonna drive you crazy.
Fine.
I know I keep saying this, but try
to focus on the progress he's making.
Like what?
You're with him every day.
You tell me.
What do you see?
Would you, um,
excuse us for a second?
What is it?
I can't do this.
Can't do what?
This, her, the therapy,
and the injections
and the equipment.
And no one can even tell us
if any of it is helping.
I think it is.
But even if it isn't,
this is what there is to do,
so we're doing it.
Well, I can't.
You don't want to. Neither do I.
Neither does he. Didn't you
hear him crying in there?
But we don't have a choice. So come on.
Jean's gotta go home soon.
I feel like i'm being punished,
and I don't even know what I did.
You can't think that way.
What else is there to think about?
Hopes for the future?
He might not even have one.
He's 14 months.
Don't write him off yet!
But you should start thinking
about the future,
because no matter what, it's coming.
And it's either gonna make you
less afraid or more,
and you will now that you either did
everything that you can for your son...
or you will be sorry.
It's okay.
I can do this.
Hi, honey.
Can I have a sandwich?
Sure.
I just have to finish these dishes.
But I'm hungry.
Well, unless you want soap on rye,
you're gonna have to wait.
Actually, why don't you make
yourself a sandwich?
But you always do it.
And you always watch me,
so I know you know how.
I'm tired.
So am I, and I still have
to vacuum and do the laundry.
My arms hurt.
I had to swim today.
And you do that
so you can get stronger,
so you can do things
like make sandwiches.
Speaking of which, in the time
we've been arguing about this,
you could've, guess what...
made a sandwich.
So could you!
Jason's mom makes him
whatever food he wants,
even french toast.
I would happy to make Jason
french toast, too.
He always tells me how pretty I am.
Not to mention,
he's also in a wheelchair,
so he can't reach the shelves
in the fridge.
But you can!
Too bad you don't appreciate it.
You're not... You're not really busy!
You just don't want to help me!
You know what? One day
I won't be able to help you
because I won't be here,
and then maybe you'll understand
why I wanted you to learn
to do stuff for yourself!
Or you won't!
But either way,
I'm not making you a sandwich.
That looks good.
Can I have a bite?
When I was born,
my doctor told my parents
I wouldn't make it through the night,
then through the week,
then it was that I was blind,
that I'd need a wheelchair.
I guess what I'm saying is...
I've really pissed my doctors off.
At first,
my mother was scared...
Scared...
of my disability,
my limitations.
I know this because she told me.
Then she realized what she was
really scared of,
was my potential
and that she's miss something
that would help me reach it.
Gandhi said,
"strength...
does not come
from a physical capacity.
It comes from an indomitable will."
My mother's probably
never heard that saying...
But every day of my life,
she showed me how true it is.
Now I...
I hope...
I can start showing her.
Thank you.
Thank you all very much.
How's our baby?
Is he okay?
We lost the baby.
But...
The other baby is fine.
It's okay.
We're gonna be okay.
I don't know how to say thank you
for saving my child's life...
And how sorry I am for...
We were gonna name him Patrick.
And he would have been...
amazing.
The funeral for Karl Mayer
was a dignified affair
attended by friends and family
and those
who loved him.
The priest spoke about
the nature of tragedy,
how it causes people to ask
"What if?"
What if, he hadn't died?
What if, I had chosen differently?
What if, I had made that mistake?
And then the priest said
the best way to honnor
those who had died
was to focus and what was
and to keep on living
the best way we know how.
And in time,
that is exactly,
what my friends would do.
Previously
on Desperate Housewives...
In the wake of a tragedy,
a daughter was safe...
You saved her life.
We owe you everything.
Orson was changed...
There's a good chance
your husband's paralyzed.
An unborn twin was gone...
We lost the baby...
but the other baby is fine.
And an ex-husband...
Karl didn't make it.
Oh, my God.
Was dead.
A month after the
death of Karl Mayer,
his family assembled
for the reading of his will.
To each, Karl left something
to remember him by.
To his great aunt,
he left a grand piano.
To his favorite cousin,
he left gold cuff links.
To his beloved daughter,
he left cash and securities.
But Karl Mayer left his most
extraordinary possession of all
to someone who wasn't
expecting a thing.
"And finally,
to my ex-wife, Susan Mayer..."
That's me.
I was just here
to support my daughter.
Seriously, I've been playing
hangman on my phone.
You were saying?
"To my dearest Susie Q.,
"who endured my infidelities
far longer than she should have,
"years of cheating, betrayals
almost from the day we were married..."
Can we skip to the part
where I get stuff?
Don't look at me like that.
You got the piano.
"While I was never good
at hiding my affairs of the flesh,"
"I'm ashamed to say
that I was more successful
at concealing some
of my financial affairs."
What does that mean?
I think dad hid money from you
when you were married.
It's not money, exactly.
It seems your ex-husband was
part owner in a business.
He was having affairs, ran a law firm
and he owned a secret business?
Glad you're finally getting
a little rest.
He specifically asks
that you keep an open mind.
It's very successful.
If it's so successful,
why do I need to keep an open mind?
Yes,
Karl Mayer left his ex-wife
something to remember him by...
Not that there was any
chance she wod forget him.

All kinds of men go to
The Double D gentlemen's club.
Frat boys looking for a thrill...
Soldiers looking to get lucky...
CEOs looking to close a deal.
Yes,
all kinds of men go to Double D's,
which can be very
upsetting to all kinds of women.
Jimbo Rooney,
co-owner of Double D's.
I was real sad
to hear about Karl's passing.
He was a good man,
and he cared about each
and every one of these dancers.
I'm sure.
Karl was always a big supporter
of the arts.
So... Who do I speak to about
selling my share
of herpes on parade?
Are you sure you want to do that?
Business has been real good lately,
especially since we started
topless karaoke tuesdays.
As lucrative an enterprise
as that seems...
Take a look around.
Have a drink.
And then if you want to sell,
you have your lawyer call me.
Look at that.
You made the o's in "Rooney"
into boobs.
Lovely.
You like that?
Wait till you see
my partner Vic's business card.
He took the "v,"
and he made it into a...
Got it.
I think
I'd really like that drink now.
Thanks, but I'm
not here for the show.
I just found out
that I own half this place.
No kiddin'.
Nice to meet you.
I'm Jennifer Morelli,
but at 10:00, I'm "Destiny."
I'm Susan Delfino.
At 10:00, I am in
a flannel nightgown.
We have a Delfino
that comes in here.
Really?
It's a pretty common name.
I think he's a plumber.
Really?
Maybe there's another
plumber with that last name.
Mike, that's it.
Mike Delfino.
Tall guy, brown hair, nice smile?
Big busted nose?
I don't think so.
Wait till the next time you see him.
A TV? You guys
didn't have to do that.
Yes, we absolutely did.
We have a family rule,
save our daughter from being squashed
by a plane, you get a 60-inch plasma.
And a faux leather remote caddy.
Thanks.
This is very generous.
Please. We could never make up
for what you did.
Or for how I behaved toward you
the past couple of weeks.
I was such a bitch.
We both said things.
But I said a lot worse a lot louder.
Yeah, you did.
By the way, I talked to HR, and
they are fine with continuing to pay you
until the baby is born
and for six weeks after that.
That's amazing.
Will Terrence fill in until I get back?
Actually, no.
He took the job in Miami.
So who's gonna take up the slack?
I'll put in extra hours,
work weekends.
Don't worry about it.
You focus on that baby.
Really? I don't want to have
this fall on you.
We gotta get going.
We've got Juanita's interview.
Right. Lynette,
do not worry. I got your back.
But I feel so guilty taking
your money and leaving you in the lurch.
I got a crazy idea.
What if I fill in for Lynette?
They're in a hurry. No time for jokes.
I'm serious.
I've done her job, or pretty damn
similar, when I was in advertising.
I could step in for her
until she gets back on her feet.
But that's putting Carlos
in an awkward position.
I think it's a great idea.
Me, too.
I think
it's a great idea, in theory,
But it's such a complicated job.
You don't think I can handle it?
I think you'd be wonderful.
Great, it's settled then.
Tom, you start tomorrow.
There you go. Now you have
nothing to feel guilty about.
Right.
Right.
Thanks again for the tv.
You guys have been way too generous.
You made scones.
My favorite.
I know. Take as many as you like.
So...
What did you want to see me about?
I wanted to give you this
donation for the building fund.
And I also have some things
in the garage for the rummage sale,
and I am also available
to run the next
sunday school pancake breakfast.
Good heavens.
What a wonderful display
of christian charity.
I just want to do my part.
Does this have anything to do
with the plane crash?
In a manner of speaking.
Do you want to talk about it?
I can't. It would change
how you feel about me.
I've known you for years.
I don't think that's possible.
I had an affair.
Are you okay?
Before you confess a sin that big,
Just try to wait
till I've swallowed.
Who was the affair with?
Karl Mayer.
He was killed in the plane crash.
The same one that injured Orson.
You must feel terribly guilty
about this.
I can't eat. I can't sleep.
That's why I wanted you
to come over here.
I have to do something
to make this right.
Seems to me the first step
is for you and Orson
to get into
our marriage outreach program.
It's too late for that.
We're about to get a divorce.
But this was before Orson
was in a wheelchair, right?
Yes.
I think you know what you need
to do to atone for this sin.
You knew it
before I walked in the door.
You want me to bring Orson home
and take care of him?
It's just that I'm not
sure that I love him anymore.
There's a quote I've always loved.
"You cannot make yourself feel
something that you do not feel,
"but you can make yourself
do right in spite of your feelings."
I don't remember that from the Bible.
It's from Pearl Buck.
I am allowed to read other books.
No matter what you feel about Orson,
if you don't help him now,
you won't be able
to live with yourself.
Fine.
I'll tell Orson tomorrow,
and I'll bring him home.
Good.
I think you've had enough.
Hold up.
Hey. What's going on?
Eddie's doing stand-up at
the Chuckle Zone on open Mike Night.
Stand-up?
As in comedy?
People are always
telling me how funny I am,
so I decided to give
the people what they want.
Don't miss out. I got this
whole riff about airline food.
It's gonna kill.
Hold up!
When they tell him he's funny
doesn't he realize they're being funny?
Tell me you're going.
I can't be the only one there.
I'll try. I actually gotta pack.
My dad left me some money, so
I'm going back east to see my cousins.
For how long?
Until they catch the guy
who attacked me,
I just don't feel safe here.
I get that.
I've been wanting
to ask you something.
I heard you were in the hospital
because of an overdose.
You didn't do that because of...
I was dealing with a lot of stuff...
problems with my parents,
having to move again.
I got really lonely.
And I guess you were part of it.
I'm better now.
Good.
Life has its low points, and we
just have to deal with them.
Speaking of which,
how do we get out of this?
Your timing is impeccable,
because it just so happens that
we have an opening right now.
Yes, we heard, and we're so excited.
Everyone know, thhis is
the best private school in town.
It says here that you have been
homeschooling Juanita.
How's that been going?
It's been so rewarding spending
time with my little angel.
It breaks my heart to see it end.
Anyway, here's her lunch. It's
all packed. We'll pick her up at 4:00.
Wait, just a second.
There are a few other families
on the waiting list before you.
There are?
Yes, but Susan Delfino
gave you such
a glowing recommendation.
And to be quite frank,
we could use a little more
diversity in this school.
It's been quite a long time since we've
had a little girl of Mexican descent.
We are very proud of our heritage...
but Juanita can stand on her own merits.
She's very bright.
And I know I'm biased, but I
do think she's a budding young genius.
I'm Mexican?
Honey, what did you just say?
He called me Mexican.
You are Mexican, honey.
You know that.
Since when?
I thought we were American.
Yes, but our ancestors
came from Mexico.
Really?
So we're like those people who
sell oranges on the side of the road?
You're busy. We should go.
Thank you very much for your time.
And, again, we really want to join
you and help with that diversity thing,
so just let us know.
 Just say it.
I don't even know what that means.
Just say it!
This is fine.
Thank you.
Thank you for agreeing to see me.
I called a few times,
but you didn't pick up.
I had no idea.
My phone was in my pants pocket,
and I had it on vibrate.
And as you may have noticed, I...
So how's rehab?
Painful.
The doctor says with a lot of hard work,
you maybe able to walk again someday.
Yes, they're very upbeat
and optimistic.
I want to run them over
with this chair.
So...
Why are you here?
I know we've been through a lot, but
it would be best for you to come home
so I can take care of you.
I'd rather be cared for
by a flatulent helper monkey.
I know you're angry,
but I'm still your wife.
Apparently we have different
definitions of the word "wife."
I am proceeding with the divorce.
I don't understand. Three weeks ago
you were begging me for another chance.
What happened?
Karl Mayer happened.
I could forgive you If you betrayed
me with anyone remotely admirable,
but you chose the most
contemptible man I have ever known.
I do not need you.
I'm having a ramp built, and I've turned
the downstairs study into your bedroom.
You're coming home where you belong,
and that's all there is to it.
You can start forgiving me,
and I'll start forgiving you.
I suggest you start first.
How could you not know you're Mexican?
We eat Mexican all the time.
We eat Chinese food, too.
Does that mean I'm Chinese?
No, that just means
your mother hates to cook.
Apparently, we have to
spell everything out for you.
You do know you're a girl, right?
What? Half the women
in your family have mustaches.
It could be very confusing.
Juanita, go inside
and play with your sister.
And while you're at it,
tell her she's Mexican, too!
I can't believe it.
We had that school right in our hands.
How could we let it get away?
The bigger question is how did we let
our daughter thinking she's white?
Sorry I'm late. I had to pick up some
lumber to build that ramp for Orson.
What a good person you are.
I need to pay the paperboy tomorrow.
Do you have any cash?
I think I have a $20 on me.
Wouldn't you rather...
Stick it in here?
Couldn't we leave it in the mailbox,
like we usually do?
I just thought that's the
way you do it down at Double D's.
Double D's?
Turns out Karl was a part owner
and left me his share.
By the way,
"Destiny" says hello.
I see where you're going with this.
Do you, Mike Delfino?
That's what she calls you.
Because that's my name.
No one hanging from a pole
should know your name.
That place is one of my accounts.
I'm their plumber.
And that's it? You go there just
to do the plumbing and nothing else?
Liar! Destiny said you had
a beer there the other night.
Sometimes when I finish the job,
I'll have a beer.
And you never look at the girls?
It's completely innocent.
I don't buy that.
I want to see the "completely
innocent" look you have
when Destiny shakes her tassels
in your face.
So I've gone to a strip club.
Are we gonna laugh about this,
or make it a thing?
I am leaning towards "thing."
Fine. If it bothers you that much,
next time I finish a job there,
I'll come right home.
You don't have to worry, because
you won't be working there anymore.
I forbid it.
You forbid it?
What kind of marriage is this?
The kind where the husband
wants to look at strippers
and the wife forbids it.
I love you.
I have never cheated on you
and I never will.
But you're not gonna tell me
what I can or can't do.
Let me get this straight...
You forbid Mike
from going to a strip club?
I know it was a little heavy-handed,
but I just can't stand those places.
What's the big whoop? Carlos takes
clients to the strip club all the time.
I've been to one...
the Ass Menagerie.
It was my brother's bachelor party.
This stripper named Cinnamon
gave me a lap dance.
Luckily, if I squinted just enough,
she looked like a young Ricky Schroder.
See, this is the reason
men go to those places...
so they can fantasize.
We all do it.
You fantasize about other men
when you're with Carlos?
Carlos has been
so many different men,
I'm surprised when
I open my eyes and it's Carlos.
Wanna know who I fantasize about?
Not necessarily.
Anyone want more wine?
Tom Scavo.
Wine now.
4th of July barbecue.
Those tan shorts.
I am there right now.
Could we please get back
to the issue at hand?
Bottom line is you cannot
forbid a man to go to strip clubs.
Don't expect him to
understand why it bothers you.
That's just the way they are.
Right?
Sorry. I was just imagining
Ricky Schroder...
wearing Tom Scavo's shorts.
Are you sure you want
to just give away your CDs?
The more you take,
the less I have to pack.
In fact,
is there anything else you want?
Anything?
How about...
Danny Bolen?
He's not really mine to give.
Come on.
He's totally into you,
Which is a complete mystery to me.
You know what? I think
I'm just gonna keep my CDs.
I didn't mean it like that.
It's just you don't seem interested,
and I have sent every signal
I can think of.
Why are you so hung up on Danny?
He's hot.
Here's the thing, Danny's
in kind of a fragile place right now.
He doesn't need
to get his heart broken.
I'm not gonna snag him
just to toss him aside.
I don't use people.
I used some people.
But I wouldn't use him.
Are you sure?
I think we have a lot in common,
and if he'd just spend
a little time with me,
he'd realize that.
You like stand-up comedy?
Too bad.
We're gonna go see Eddie.
Sorry I'm late.
How was work?
Crazy.
I had three conference calls
and a 2-hour client
meeting with Gary Danner.
How was your day?
Even crazier.
I peed twice in every
bathroom in the house.
What's that?
Little matching outfits
for the twins
that people gave us.
I thought I'd give them to charity.
I ran into the Petersons today.
They just heard, wanted
to see how you were.
So Gary Danner...
He's a prickly S.O.B.
Tell me about it.
Check out this proposal
I worked up for him.
What do you mean, "hmm"?
I'm glad you showed this to me.
I know Danner. And trust me,
you do not want to go down this road.
Why not?
Don't worry. I can fix it.
Where's a pen?
Wait... Actually...
I showed it to Danner today.
He loved it.
Gary Danner liked this?
No, he loved it,
But not as much as Carlos. He told me
it was the best written proposal
he has ever seen, bar none.
What's for dinner?
Meat loaf.
What's wrong?
Nothing. It's... Well,
that's quite a compliment.
Not to mention a bit of a slam
on the work that I did.
Honey, he's just encouraging me.
I don't think he was
thinking about you at all.
By the way, this meat loaf...
The best I have ever tasted.
Bar none?
Just eat.
It's coming along beautifully.
Thanks. So,
when's Orson coming home?
It's still a bit up in the air.
But I guess now would be
a good time to call him
and let him know we're almost ready.
Orson Hodge's room, please.
Would you stop
hammering for a moment?
He checked out?
But that's impossible.
Where would he have gone?
Mike, please.
It's not me.
Never mind. I think I found him.
Oh, boy. The fat's in the fire now.
What is going on here?
The husband you're
divorcing has found new digs.
Before you jump down my throat...
Roy and I are on fixed incomes.
You can't blame us for
taking in a boarder,
especially one who can't
get to the second story.
That's our naked floor.
What are you doing here?
Enjoying my new home.
It's rather quaint,
once you get used to the smell
of denture cream and scotch.
Don't mind me.
Just making sure you don't
slap a guy in a wheelchair.
So how are you planning
to pay your rent?
Well, I'm a bit cash-strapped
at the moment, but,
Karen knows I'm good for it.
Once he gets his divorce settlement,
he's writing me a big, fat check.
So how long are we talking?
A month, two?
There will be no divorce, and
if he tries to file for one,
there will be delays,
motions and appeals.
It could take years for
him to ever see a dime.
Your wife loves you. Go home.
Stop right now. Do you hear me?
So am I taking down the ramp?
Leave it.
You'll need it soon enough.
Almost home, dear.
Mike, call the police. My
wife is holding me hostage!
We've all been there, big guy.
I had an appointment with
my O.B. around the corner,
and I just thought
I'd stop by and say hi.
I also wanted to
thank you for being so nice to
Tom, our little temp.
How's he doing?
He's amazing.
It's okay, Carlos.
You can tell me the truth.
He's knocking my socks off.
Everybody is so impressed.
Well, good.
Good, good, good.
I'm so proud of him.
But when I drop this kid,
Tom's out on his ass, right?
Excuse me?
I love him and
I'm glad he's doing well here,
but this is my job.
At some point,
I'm gonna want it back.
And I say that as the woman
who dove in front of a spinning
propeller to save your child's life.
Of course this is your job.
And you can have it
back any time you want.
Well, that's all I needed to hear.
It's just that I was
under the impression
you were planning to stay
at home with your baby.
And why would you be
under that impression?
That's what Tom said.
What exactly did tom say?
I really don't want to get
in the middle of this.
Carlos, I saved
a member of your family.
It doesn't mean I can't
take another one out.
And you can train a dog to do
almost anything, but you can't do,
you can't do with cats and... cats.
And did you ever try to get a cat
to fetch? They're like, you know,
they won't do it.
Stupid cats. Am I right, people?
You guys have been great.
Good night.
Give it up for Eddie Orlofsky
Come on, folks!
So, what do you think?
I never realized there were so many
differences between dogs and cats.
That's why I'm the comic, babe.
I'm off to get my free drink.
I left my jacket in
the car. Walk me out?
Jacket? It's hot as hell in here.
Now I feel a chill.
I gotta use the bathroom.
Okay, what is your problem?
Excuse me?
Whenever we're alone together,
you find some reason to bail.
Why aren't you into me?
Ana, there's not a lot
of room to be into you.
Because of how much you're into you.
You did not just call me conceited.
Chill. It's not like
I asked you to spell it.
I'm not stupid,
and I am definitely not
the attention whore at this table.
I heard about your little
stunt with the pills.
Okay, that was mean.
I'm sorry that I said that.
Don't be sorry.
You're right.
I like the blunt Ana
more than the cute Ana.
So...
you think I'm cute?
You're home. Perfect timing.
Margaritas. What's the occasion?
We're getting drunk, Mexican style.
Principal Hobson just called,
and Juanita got accepted
to Oakridge.
Seriously?
I am free from homeschooling.
No more fighting, no more threats,
and no more parent-teacher
conferences with you.
Come on. Start guzzlin'.
I don't think she should go.
I've been thinking about it all day.
Let's keep her in public school.
We can't. She was expelled.
I made some calls.
Jefferson elementary can take her.
That's way out in my pleasant.
And there's a lot of Latino families
that live in that area.
So what? We have a much better
school right here in our backyard.
I'm not schlepping way over there
just so she can be with those people.
"Those" people?
Don't you mean "our" people?
Our people are
the rich private school people.
Oh, my God. I know exactly
what is going on here.
What?
You are ashamed of being Mexican.
That's insane.
No, it totally makes sense.
All of our friends are white.
You didn't want me
to teach the girls Spanish.
Because I don't understand it, I didn't
want you guys plotting behind my back.
When we bought this house
and I said we would be
the only Mexicans,
you remember what you said?
"Fine by me."
You're right. It's my fault.
I should have told the realtor,
"Forget square footage and central air.
Find us something next
door to a Mariachi bar."
Deny it all you want.
You are a self-hating Mexican.
Well, you're a self-wiping Mexican.
What does that mean?
Traffic was insane.
Is there any dinner left?
I haven't eaten since lunch.
Everything okay?
I talked to Carlos today.
About what?
He was under the impression
that when I have this baby,
I'll be staying home with her.
Where would he get a
crazy idea like that?
I told him.
You're not even denying it?
I thought it might be
in your best interest.
Seriously?
You know how much
that job means to me.
You know how much I hate
being a stay-at-home Mom.
How could you think
I'd be okay with this?
Because we lost a baby.
Honey, I thought you might want
to stay home with this one,
because she's all the more precious,
given what happened.
So that's how I'm supposed to feel.
I don't know how you feel Lynette,
because you never talk about it.
It's been a month.
Every time I try to bring it up,
you change the subject.
Because I'm dealing with it.
Shouldn't we
be dealing with it together?
You want to talk about this?
Fine! We lost a kid,
we'll never meet him.
We'll spend the rest of
our lives looking at one,
always wondering
why there aren't two.
How can saying this
out loud be helpful?
You're right. It's not.
You win.
After you have the baby,
go back to your job.
Thank you.
You want me to fix you something?
I'm not hungry anymore.
Now remember, fellas,
these ladies don't work for free.
Long time no see.
I got the call about
your John being backed up.
What? No, our bathrooms
are working just fine.
That's weird. Some woman called
and said it was an emergency.
I'm sorry, man.
I don't know what to tell you.
All right, it's time to introduce
our newest double D doll...
Miss Fix-it!
What the hell?
What are you doing here?
What the hell are you doing?
Well, since I'm one of the owners,
I figured I should
really learn the business,
from my bottom up.
You mind?
I'm trying to make a deposit here.
Will you come down
from there right now?
Why? They're just looking.
It's completely innocent. Right?
Hey, pal. Sit down. I didn't come here
to see the back of your head.
This is not funny.
I can't talk. I've got a room full
of Neanderthals to entertain.
What are you doing?
Just giving people what they want.
Don't you dare. Susan, I'm serious.
I want you off of that stage right now.
Wait. Are you forbidding
me from doing something?
I thought we didn't have
that kind of marriage.
Very cute. If I have to, I will
carry you out of here myself.
What exactly is the problem, Mike?
Okay. I get it. I will never...
come back here.
Let's go home, Mrs. Fix-it.
Wait. Wait. Forgot my tips!
What are you looking at?
Nothing. Just some old photos.
I didn't know you had these.
We couldn't afford frames,
so my dad would put these
on the wall with tape.
Is that you?
I was about 5.
You're cute.
But that toolshed's
seen better days.
That was our house.
It's funny.
I'm smiling in all of
these photos, but...
I hated that town.
Everybody was so poor.
Everybody was Mexican.
Back then I thought
they were the same thing.
And even though I was only 5,
I knew I wanted out.
And you can call it
self-loathing, Carlos, but,
I just...
don't want my kids to ever
know I lived like that.
That's your dad.
He was so strong.
I would run to meet him
when he'd come home
from working in the factories,
and he'd lift me up on his shoulders.
I loved that.
I bet he did, too.
I used to ask him, "Papa,
why do you work so much?"
And he would say, "so one day
we can live in a beautiful house."
But we never did.
But you do now.
Your father had dreams, Gaby,
but they were for you, and
he sacrificed a lot to get you here.
Whatever our children
achieve in life,
it's because of dreams that started
on the shoulders of a
proud, strong, Mexican man.
That is why I want our kids
to know where they came from.
I want that, too.
So...
How do your physical
therapists think you're doing?
Do they think
you're making progress?
Orson, it's been three days. You're
gonna have to talk to me sometime.
I know why you're doing this, Bree.
Reverend Sykes stopped by
to check on my progress.
He was very proud of himself
for convincing you to
take me on as charity work.
It's not charity work.
When I had that affair,
I didn't just betray you.
I betrayed my faith as well.
So please, you have to let me
help you or I am...
Or you won't get into heaven?
Didn't realize how
much this means to you.
I guess I can find
a way to be happy.
Thank you so much, Orson.
I am gonna take
such good care of you.
By the way, my soup is cold.
Well,
mine is hot.
You can have this.
While you're up, could you
get me a glass of wine?
Yes, of course.
And perhaps for dessert,
some of your delicious Crme brle.
Orson, that takes over
an hour to prepare...
Well, I would do it myself, but...
And we're out of vanilla beans.
You might have to run to the store.
The act itself
is quite simple...
You strip away the outer layer
and reveal what's underneath.
Of course,
sometimes the results
can be quite surprising.
If you strip away the veneer
of happy domesticity,
you may find grief.
If you strip away
that facade of wealth,
you may find self-loathing.
If you strip away
the veil of helplessness,
you may find cruelty.
Yes, stripping
can be a dangerous pastime.
But for a lucky few,
it can also be...
a lot of fun.
Previously...
Principal Hobson just called
and Juanita got accepted to Oakridge.
There was acceptance...
I like the blunt Ana
more than the cute Ana.
So you think I'm cute?
A plea...
Let me help you, or I am...
Or you won't get into heaven?
A breakdown...
Did you stab yourself?
I have to get to Mike!
And a confrontation.
I don't know how you feel,
because you never talk about it!
We lost a kid.
How can saying this out loud be helpful?
If you want to throw
a successful dinner party,
there are certain rules
that must be followed.
If the good silver is used,
it must be polished.
If music is played,
the volume should be low.
If the guests bring wine,
it must be served.
And if the evening is
to be truly successful...
There must be a toast.
To Lee. This dinner
has been a total triumph.
And it's not over yet.
I made a fruit tart for dessert.
And in case any of you are diabetic,
let me just say...
it was nice knowing you.
No. Seriously,
this is how we lost his cousin.
Bob, where's the whipped cream?
I totally forgot. I was on my phone
and I drove right past the store.
Of course,
'cause it's something that I needed.
I was working all day. If it was that
important, why didn't you just get it?
I work, too.
Selling houses is work.
House.
He's sold one house in six months.
Attacking.
What's that?
My feelings journal.
Lee and I are seeing this counselor.
She has us write down our negative
feelings to discuss in our sessions.
Seems like you got
a lot of feelings there.
That's volume three,
with an entire chapter about me
forgetting to put down the toilet seat.
I thought that would be the one
advantage with two guys living together.
You'd think.
The good news is
that you're getting help.
We should think about that.
What?
You know, to help us with our stuff.
Can we talk about our stuff later?
We could, but you won't.
She never wants to talk.
You know how I feel about therapy.
It's for weak, indulgent...
Straight people.
You guys totally make it work.
I used to feel the same way.
But this lady, she's really great.
Volume three?
Can't we give it a try?
I don't need someone
telling me how I feel.
So could we just drop it?
And the number one rule
for a successful dinner party?
After dessert, let's karaoke!
Keep discussion of your marriage
to an absolute minimum.
Par la Wisteria Team:
MiniBen314, Jayson.Sosweet
www.wisteria-team.fr
www.sous-titres.eu
Dr. Brent Avedon was
the head of psychology
at the Fairview health center.
He spent his days treating
antisocial adolescents,
delusional dowagers...
And bipolar businessmen.
But lately,
his most interesting patient
was a housewife
who'd had a nervous breakdown.
I was just so lonely.
And then one day,
along came this wonderful man...
A man who made me laugh,
who gave me hope again...
And who turned out
to be in love with someone else.
So I went back to being lonely.
Only it was worse now because...
He wasn't really gone.
He was across the street,
holding her hand,
laughing with her.
So one day...
I pretended,
just for a second...
that it wasn't
her hand he was holding.
It was mine.
And that's
how the fantasies started?
When I was hurting,
I would let myself imagine
that he was there with me.
But then those moments started to...
mean more to me than what was real.
So...
I just let myself have them.
I let them take over.
What about now? Do you
feel that the medication is helping you?
I certainly
have a firmer grasp on reality now.
I can see things,
for the first time in a long while,
very clearly.
That's great.
Not really.
Because now
I can see what I've done to my life.
And...
How I've ruined it.
Orson, it's time for
me to give you your bath.
Not now.
You haven't bathed in over a week.
I don't want
to do this any more than you do,
but frankly, you're getting ripe.
I said I don't want a bath.
It's not about what you want anymore.
It's a matter of preserving the drapes.
To have another
human being bathe me is humiliating.
Here.
What's this?
A list of things I need at the store.
I just went to the store
for you an hour ago. Can't it wait?
I need these items immediately.
It's urgent.
How are cornnuts urgent?
I'm sorry, Bree.
I just thought
that since you played a major part
in putting me in this chair,
you'd want to play a small part
in making my new life tolerable.
Give me the list.
Better yet, leave
it on the table and then back away.
Hey, teach.
I just dropped off
Juanita for her first day.
She's a little nervous.
She's gonna love it here.
The teachers are great.
What animal is she?
Excuse me?
They test the kids and they place
them in groups according to their level.
In math, there's leopards,
chipmunks, giraffes.
It should be in her folder.
She's a leopard.
What's MJ?
He's a giraffe.
So...
Which is the advanced group?
No one knows.
They won't even tell me.
Principal Hobson feels
that if the parents find out,
they'll freak and
get all competitive.
That's crazy.
Who cares?
Exactly.
Leopards are the morons,
aren't they?
I didn't say that.
Yeah, you did.
When I asked about MJ,
you were like, "He's a giraffe!"
And I said Juanita was a leopard,
and you were like, "Oh."
You're just jumping to conclusions.
You know something.
Spill it!
I don't know for sure,
But I teach these kids,
and it's pretty obvious.
We were making paper globes
This...
is Rachel Miller.
Damn, that's good.
She's a giraffe.
And this is Wendy Benson.
Chipmunk.
And this one was
made by Adam Hunter...
A leopard.
It looks like an
actual leopard made it.
There's nothing wrong with being
a leopard. They're very important here.
They move the cafeteria tables,
excellent door holders.
This isn't fair.
We have a saying around here.
"It's the pace, not the race."
I know my daughter.
She is all giraffe.
I'm gonna go talk to the principal.
You don't push. You...
Sorry. My daughter wasn't
here to hold it for me.
Dinner's ready. Go wash up.
What is that?
It's nothing.
It's personal.
Personal?
Yes.
And I think it's important that
we respect each other's boundaries.
This morning, you walked in and sat
on the toilet while I shaved my legs.
We have no boundaries.
Attacking.
What?
You sound just like Bob and...
Is that a feelings journal?
If you must know, yes, it is.
I started seeing their therapist.
Why didn't you tell me?
Because I wanted to talk to someone,
and I didn't need your ridicule.
Are you talking about the baby?
It started out about that.
But now we're on to,
other things.
Other things? You mean like me?
I might've mentioned
you once or twice.
Once or twice?
I bet if we downed a shot every
time we read the name "Lynette,"
we'd be hammered by page two.
Let me see that.
No way.
But if your're really
interested in what's in here,
you can always join me in therapy.
Like hell.
Fine.
Then I guess you'll just
have to wait for the movie.
Here we go.
Thanks again for having me.
This all looks delicious.
It's your first night over. I wanted to
make you a traditional Italian meal...
Rigatoni with sausage,
chicken parmesan.
Just salad would be great.
Screw the salad.
That came out of a bag.
This rigatoni came from my heart.
To be honest, I don't eat carbs.
But you'll make an exception 'cause I've
been sweatin' over the stove all day.
Let it go.
She's watching her weight.
Her weight?
If I put the AC on high,
it'll blow her across the room.
I just have to be careful.
As soon as a graduate,
I'm going to NY to be a model.
No college?
Are you kidding?
And miss my prime modeling years?
I think it's great.
It takes guts to follow a dream.
It's great, but
it'd be nice to have something other
than the porn industry to fall back on.
I'm not saying that's gonna happen.
But a lot of models do end up that way.
I know it's risky,
but I'm really passionate about this.
And the best way
to be successful in life
is to do what you're
passionate about.
That's why I keep telling
Danny to pursue his poetry.
Poetry?
It's amazing, right?
I wouldn't know.
I'm too busy cooking
food nobody's gonna eat.
Why didn't you ever
show me your poetry?
It's no big deal.
Danny, it's great.
I keep telling him he should come to New
York with me to focus on his writing.
A model and a poet.
So while you're doin' porn,
he can make the dialogue rhyme.
This is why I don't tell her stuff.
I'm sorry.
I was just trying to make a joke.
Let's get back to dinner.
No. I'm good.
Carbs.
I'll be out running errands today,
so you'll have to let the physical
therapist in when she arrives.
What's wrong?
There's no strawberries.
You know I like strawberries
with my waffles.
I am sorry.
They're right here. There you go.
Strawberries.
Enjoy.
I need whipped cream.
Unless you think the strawberries
are gonna magically
stick to the waffles by themselves.
Not so fast.
Say "Please."
I will not.
Give me my breakfast.
I am happy to do whatever you ask,
but I will not treated like a slave.
Now say "Please."
Now that I look at your waffle,
I understand
why you're so eager to have it.
You know the magic word.
It has six letters.
I know one that has three.
If you don't give me my food,
I'm gonna shove that fork up it.
You can have it when
you're ready to be polite.
Mr. Hobson,
my daughter is incredibly bright.
I just need to know if
she's in the advanced classes.
You know that we have
a policy not to disclose that.
You don't have to say anything.
Blink when I mention the smart group.
Leopard.
Mrs. Solis...
Wait, was that a blink or a twitch?
I can't tell. You seem very nervous.
See, this is exactly
why we don't tell the parents.
They start behaving irrationally.
Stop trying to read things
on my desk
upside-down.
What's the big deal? I just need to know
if my daughter's gonna succeed in life.
She's 7.
I suggest that you stop prying
and just be proud of her
no matter what group she's in.
I am proud of her, and I don't pry.
By the way,
enjoy your colonoscopy on the 16th.
Mom. What are you doing here?
I was having a nice get-to-know-you chat
with the principal.
Who are your friends?
This is Wendy and Rachel.
We're in math together.
Wait a minute.
I think I saw your art projects.
Wendy, you're a chipmunk, right?
And, Rachel, you're a giraffe?
You know what I would love to do?
Is take a picture with Juanita
and her friends.
And you know what
would be really cute?
Is if you hold up
your math homework.
Got it.
But I wasn't smiling.
It's a tough world out there.
Not much to smile about.
Have a great day!
Your mom's weird.
You have no idea.
I'm letting myself in.
Time for your therapy.
Help me!
Help.
Dear lord!
What happened?
I was trying to get those waffles,
And I fell out of my chair.
What are they doing up there?
Starving him?
That's ridiculous.
Really? So you don't torment
him by putting food out of his reach?
You kinda had to be there for that.
Can someone please
get me a piece of bread?
For God sakes! Stop that!
Please hit me in the legs this time.
There's no feeling there.
Mrs. Hodge, may I speak
to you privately for a moment?
You have to believe me.
I would never hit my husband.
I sensed him being
a little dramatic.
But withholding food?
The whole thing started because
he refused to say please...
Which I know sounds rather petty,
but you have to understand.
He has been impossible lately.
The man is facing
life in a wheelchair.
He's mad at the world, unfortunately,
he's taking it out on you.
I know this is not easy.
But until he comes to accept this,
you're gonna have to figure
out how to be more patient.
And if you can't,
it's my obligation to report it.
And give the man a bath.
Physical therapy
shouldn't require gloves.
You weren't home when they tried
to deliver this, so I signed for it.
We saw an ad for...
Honest to God, don't need to know.
Good.
Looks like somebody
got a new girlfriend.
Not for long.
I do not approve.
You don't approve, and she's got a body
that would make the pope walk
through a sliding glass door.
Gosh, who's gonna win?
He is my kid.
If I don't think she is good for him,
I will do whatever I have to do.
Which will drive him
towards her and away from you.
I know what it's like when
a mom hates the hottie her son loves.
Bob's mom hated me.
I always thought that Bob was...
The point is,
she overplayed her hand
and made Bob choose between us.
The long story short,
I'm cuddling up with Bob every night.
And where's mama? Nursing home.
How'd she get there? Don't know.
Can't remember.
It's just...
I don't know this girl.
I don't know if I can trust her.
Then you better get to know her.
I'd hate to see you lose your son
cause you're afraid to share him.
Get outta here.
Carlos, did you get
the pictures I sent you?
You're as beautiful as the day we met.
Time hasn't touched you at all.
Not of me, of the math homework.
What?
Here.
This assignment looks easy,
doesn't it?
Pretty basic, yeah.
And look at this one
with the multiplication,
little more complicated, right?
I guess.
And this one...
Word problems. Fractions.
This is the hardest one, isn't it?
Looks like it. So?
This is the leopard's homework.
That cleared that up.
No. Don't you get it?
Our daughter is a leopard.
She's in the advanced class.
Good for her.
Poor Susan.
Yeah? Why?
Well, she was convinced
that MJ's brilliant,
and it turns out he's
in the slow group.
I'd hate for her to find out.
Gaby, you are not telling her.
Why not?
She didn't have any trouble telling
me she thought Juanita was one
thermos short of a lunch box.
She said that?
With her tone.
We've had enough drama with
the neighbors lately, so just drop it.
Fine, I'll drop it.
But just so you know,
I like you better when you're reading
the newspaper pretending to listen.
Sure, take whatever you need.
What are you doing here?
I told them I don't
want any visitors.
Who says I'm visiting?
Maybe I'm bonkers, too.
Gonna eat the applesauce?
Remember when my gout flared
up and I couldn't walk?
And you used to come over to see me?
I figured I owe ya.
Debt paid. Goodbye.
I see you got your
charming personality back.
So... when are you gonna
be coming back home?
What makes you think
I would ever come back?
After what I did to those
people? No. They hate me.
Take it from the reigning
odd duck on the Lane,
nobody cares about
all that silly stuff.
You're right. Bree and I
can just laugh, laugh, laugh
about silly me nearly
destroying her business.
And I'll tell Susan that I was just
joshing about trying to wreck
her marriage.
And I'll bet Mike is still chuckling
about me getting him thrown in jail.
Will you listen?
Kathy, I'm serious.
I'm willing to bet there's more
forgiveness there than you imagine.
In that case, you know what?
What?
Maybe you are bonkers.
Look who's here.
Hey, Susan. What's up?
I was going through some of MJ's stuff
and I found these math
workbooks from last year.
I thought Juanita
would find them helpful.
Well...
Thank you.
No problem. I thought
it might help her catch up.
Catch up?
You know, from when
she was out of school.
She was never out of school,
I was homeschooling her.
And I know you did
the best you could.
But now she has
professional teachers,
and I bet she's gonna
catch up to MJ in no time.
Get her.
By the way, did you hear?
Leopards are the advanced students.
What?
It's true. Chipmunks are average.
And giraffes...
well, those cafeteria tables
aren't gonna move themselves.
How do you know this?
I got a copy of each group's homework.
Trust me. I cracked the code.
So that means
that MJ's not in the...
But you said it yourself...
it's no big deal.
"It's the pace,
not the race," right?
Right.
And please, don't
say anything to anyone.
You know how competitive
some parents can get.
All too well.
I'm finished. Can I have
my milk and cookies now?
Sure, sweetie.
You have some pasta stuck to
the right side of your face.
No, sweetie. Your right.
Never mind.
Mike, can you help
me take out the trash?
Sure.
Never mind that.
Okay, so he's a giraffe.
You know, there's nothing
wrong with being average.
Chipmunks are average.
How many times do I have to tell you?
Leopards, chipmunks, giraffes.
I love him so much, Mike.
What if he's...
Slow?
He's not slow.
He's a smart, inquisitive,
bright little boy.
He's got his hand
stuck in the glass.
Come on, buddy.
Come on.
Just... just hold the glass.
Pull with the other hand.
You can do it.
Come on, MJ.
See? You were worried about nothing.
You're right.
He's heading toward
the toaster with a fork!
I'm heading out.
Okay. Mwah. Wanna grab lunch today?
Maybe tomorrow. I have a thing.
If you mean therapy,
why not just say "therapy"?
I just didn't want to get
into a fight. That's all.
Won't you need this?
Right. Thanks.
Don't you wanna know if I read it?
I'd know if you read it.
Excuse me. Are you
waiting for Dr. Graham?
Don't tell me she double-booked again.
No. I don't have an appointment.
But I really need to talk to her,
so can I have yours?
I don't know. I really
need to talk to her, too.
Seriously? Because I was
looking at you thinking,
what is he doing here?
That guy's really got it together.
Thanks. But I'm been having
a pretty hard time lately.
I'll give you 200 bucks.
Cash?
20's okay?
What were you going
to talk to her about?
I'm starting to feel
the urge to gamble again.
Thanks.
Mr. Jameson?
He had to go, but he said I
could have his appointment.
I'm sorry, but it
doesn't work like that.
If you're interested
in becoming a patient...
I'm not. I am Mrs. Tom Scavo.
Yep, that's what I thought.
Well, I don't blame you
for reacting like that.
I can only imagine the stories
Tom's been reading to you
from his big book of wah!
So... here I am,
Tom Scavo's bitch of
a wife, in the flesh.
Why do you put it like that?
I don't know specifically
what word he uses.
I'm just...
picking the one
that seems the most likely.
So you think your husband
describes you as a bitch?
Doesn't he?
What Tom says in this room is private.
Which means yes?
Well, obviously, it does to you.
I'm just wondering
why that might be.
I see what you're trying to do,
but I did not come here for therapy.
I came here to defend myself. Because
there's two sides to every story.
So you're not a bitch?
Not all the time, no.
But sometimes?
I just...
need...
want...
to feel like I'm in control,
and when I don't, that makes me mad.
Maybe I'm mad a lot
because I don't know if you've noticed,
but you can't control
what happens in life.
Like your baby dying?
I'm going to sit down, but only...
Because I'm tired.
Unless you need to go or something.
No. I don't need to go anywhere.
How was your day?
Is that a...
Yep.
Looks like we'll be
going to therapy together.
Really?
That is great news.
Thank you.
Where's dinner?
I mean, you were home all day.
What are you writing?
You'll find out, Tuesday at 12:30.
Colleen! Can I talk to you?
I've got parent-teacher conferences,
but not for a few minutes. What's up?
It's about MJ how is he
doing in your math class?
Oh, he's such a joy.
You just did the "he's such
a joy" with the head tilt.
I give that one to parents all the time
when I think their kid is driftwood.
No, seriously, MJ's doing great.
Oh, really? Well, if
he's doing so great...
Why is he a giraffe?
What?
He should be a leopard.
They're the advanced students.
You don't know that.
I do now.
Gaby Solis broke the code.
What?
That's right. Giraffes
are the slow learners,
and you know it.
Giraffes are the slow learners?
No, no, Mrs. Chapman.
No one said that.
Why don't you wait
for me in my classroom?
Gabrielle Solis figured out the code
leopards, chipmunks, giraffes.
Jenny, we got the code!
Leopards are the smart ones!
Now look at what you've done.
MJ is here. He's a leopard.
Get used to it.
Where have you been?
I needed to close the door.
Well, I thought a
little fresh air would be nice.
It isn't.
Well, as the person
who has to share a house
with the person who won't take
a bath, I need the fresh air.
I don't care. Close it.
I know that you are angry
at the world right now.
What happened to
you is unimaginable,
and I am gonna do whatever I
can to help you through this.
And all I ask in return is that you
treat me with a little bit of courtesy,
and that includes
using the word "please."
Why the sudden interest
in etiquette, Bree?
I mean, I don't recall you saying
"please" before you cheated on me.
This conversation is
over. The door stays open.
I want it closed.
No. You stink.
And you're a whore!
Here's the difference...
I can get clean.
Yes, you can.
What are you doing?
What is going on?
I'm not even dressed.
What is that? What... what
is that? What's going on?
Bree, stop.
You wouldn't.
Okay, Bree, stop it.
Stop. Bree.
If only there was a word you
could use to get me to stop,
like "please".
I'm calling Joyce.
Say "please"!
Go to hell!
Why can't you just say
it? It's easy. Please.
Please, please! Please stop it!
Please roll me over. Please
help me off the toilet.
Please, please, please!
That's the life I'm facing now,
having to ask people
for help for everything.
Do you know how hard that is?!
Every morning I wake up
at 5:00. You get upt 6:30.
For an hour and a half, I lie there,
staring at the bedroom door,
fantasizing about how
lovely it would be...
how excruciatingly
lovely it would be...
to get up and make myself
a cup of tea one last time.
No "please."
Just hot water and tea.
I'm so sorry.
Forgive me.
Please.
What are you in for?
Eating paste.
What animal group are you?
Giraffe.
Damn.
Joey Murphy.
I'll be with you two in a moment.
Sorry for getting you in trouble.
It's my own fault.
I got carried away.
Me, too.
It was just so important to
me that Juanita was doing well.
I know.
No, I don't think you do.
My kids are my calling card.
They're what I have
to show for myself.
I don't have a career,
Susan. My kids are my job.
And if they succeed or not...
it's because of how I raise them.
Well, at least you get
to raise them.
Ever since I took this job,
I feel like I'm never with MJ.
I constantly worry.
Am I there enough for him?
Am I letting him down?
You don't have anything
to worry about.
MJ's a fantastic kid.
Well, so is Juanita.
Their moms are competitive nuts.
This has been so ridiculous.
Leopards and giraffes and chipmunks
I mean, who created this crazy system?
You know, reading class is just as bad.
There's otters, penguins and seals.
Yeah, Juanita's an otter.
I mean, what does an otter have
to do with learning how to read?
Juanita's an otter?
Why? What's MJ?
Penguin.
This is pretty. What do you think?
I think maybe I'd buy
it for my grandma...
If I hated her.
You're so funny.
So... as much fun as
we're having here,
why are we doing this?
We are getting to know each other.
You know me, and you don't like me.
It's not that I don't like you.
It's just, I don't think
you're good for Danny.
Why? Because
I wouldn't eat your pasta?
Rigatoni.
And no.
It's because you are a
good-time girl out to have fun.
I don't blame you. You're young,
beautiful. You're supposed to have fun.
But Danny has been through a lot,
and he needs someone who
is not gonna hurt him.
I know Danny has been
through rough stuff.
When he lashes out
and gets all defensive,
trying to protect himself?
I get it,
because I used to do it, too.
It's the thing that
made me like him.
I know how he feels,
and it's not fun at all.
I don't care if you like me
and I don't care if
you hate how I dress,
but I am not gona hurt Danny.
How can I be sure of that?
You can't.
But it doesn't matter, 'cause...
I'm not going anywhere.
What are you doing back here?
I've been thinking about
what you said last time.
The more I thought about it,
the more it pissed me off.
Why is that?
The people on that street have
been your friends for years.
You really think we
would dump your ass
just 'cause you went off
the deep end for some months?
I appreciate you coming here.
I do.
But after everything I did,
I don't see how anyone
could forgive me.
Well, we're not
saying it'll be easy.
But we'll give it a try.
I told them how much
better you were doing,
but they couldn't
take my word for it,
so they had to see for themselves.
In our darkest moments,
we all need someone who will listen.
Some turn to friendly professionals.
A few rely on those
who are older and wiser.
Others seek out
someone who knows what
they're going through.
But for most of us,
nothing is quite so therapeutic
as a good long talk
with a few old friends.
Previously
on Desperate Housewives...
Your ex-husband was
part owner in a business.
Susan came into
an inheritance.
Who do I speak to about selling
my share of herpes on parade?
Lynette acquiesced...
Looks like we'll be going to therapy.
That is great news! Thank you.
As soon as I graduate high school,
I'm going to New York to be a model.
Angie's concerns
made her more protective.
You know I've always felt bad
about the way we've had to raise you,
being on the run and all.
The door stays open.
I want it closed.
You stink.
And you're a whore! Here's
the difference. I can get clean.
Stop!
Say "please".
 And Orson expressed his feelings.
Please!
That's the life I'm facing now.
Having to ask people for help,
for everything.
Do you know how hard that is?!
Orson Hodge was smiling again,
and it was starting to worry
his wife.
You see, since his accident,
Bree Hodge had grown accustomed
to her husband's severe mood swings.
She had grown used to
his unexpected rage...
His sudden anguish...
His deep depression.
But lately,
an odd tranquility
had settled over Orson,
and his wife had the feeling
something was terribly wrong.
Sadly,
she was right.
What's going on here?
Just thought I'd give away
some things I don't need anymore.
You got these in 8 and half?
Sorry, Roy. Just carry men's sizes.
I can understand why you might want
to give away your sporting equipment,
but why would you give away
your books and your CDs?
And for God sakes, you can
still use your headphones.
These are amazing!
Give me those.
What is wrong with you people?
Don't you realize
you're taking advantage
of a man who is
emotionally distraught?
He seemed to be in a great mood.
Until lady sunshine walked in.
Sorry, we assumed
you had talked about it.
We didn't. That doesn't excuse the fact
that you're acting like vultures.
It's a good thing I came home,
or you'd be picking through his closet.
You know what, guys? We should go.
And please leave
your plunder behind.
Come on. At my age,
it's just a short-term loan.
What has gotten into you?
I'm sorry, darling.
I had no intention of upsetting you.
Keep my things, give them away.
Ultimately, it doesn't matter.
Yes, Orson Hodge was smiling again
and Bree would soon learn
the reason why.
You see, her husband...
had decided to kill himself.

In this never-ending drama
we call life,
everyone has a part to play.
Some are cast as romantic leads.
Others end up playing the victim.
And a few provide comic relief.
But if the drama is to be
really compelling,
there must be a hero...
and a villain.
Hey, Mrs. Kinsky.
Look who's here!
The garbage police.
I hate to bug you, but you're still not
separating your glass and your plastics.
The city passed
that ordinance, remember?
How I envy you...
Young, pretty,
able to crouch
for hours behind a bush,
waiting for a neighbor
to dump her trash.
Maybe you don't get
how easy it is to recycle.
I get it.
I just don't want to do it.
I've been throwing styrofoam into
the trash since before you were born,
and the sky is still blue
and the grass is still green.
Maybe now, but what will it be
like for our grandchildren?
My son is shooting blanks,
and my daughter likes the ladies.
Grandkids are
the least of my concerns.
So you don't care
about our planet at all?
By the time
it's a problem, I'll be long gone.
Let the cockroaches
and the robots fight over it.
What was that all about?
What do you think?
Come on.
One old crank
doesn't want to recycle.
You don't care about that stuff
anymore, remember?
Of course I still care.
Yeah, fine. You can care.
Don't be blowing our cover.
So what am I supposed to do? Stand
back and watch her defile our planet?
That's exactly what
you're supposed to do.
"Sometimes you chain
yourself to the tree,
and sometimes you go after
the guy with the saw."
That's what Patrick used to say.
We don't talk about Patrick anymore.
I'm just saying.
So am I.
So the lawyer says
you sign right here,
and you are officially bought
out of the strip club business.
Let's hope I don't get
my share in singles.
And here's a little something
to remember us by.
"Lap dancing...
It's a grind."
I will be sure to wear this on the
next field trip I take with my students.
Thanks, Jimbo.
Good luck.
You, too.
Bye, Mrs. D.
Take care, Robin.
"Moby Dick"?
It's not what you think.
It's about a whale.
Yes, I know. It's a classic.
I saw an article about a hundred
books you should read before dying,
and I thought,
with all the high cholesterol
in my family, I better get crackin'.
Good for you.
So what are you gonna do now?
This was never really my job.
I'm actually a teacher.
Really?
That is so cool.
I thought about being a teacher.
I went a couple semesters,
but then my family had
some money problems, and,
nine years later,
I'm still wearing tassels.
Robin, you're being requested
in the VIP lounge.
Good luck with those hundred books.
Thank you.
Not this guy again.
I keep telling him to keep
the tips and buy himself a toothbrush.
Robin, wait.
You don't have to keep doing
this if it makes you unhappy.
I've got bills to pay, Mrs. Delfino.
I know, but you don't
have to work here.
You could do anything you want.
That's easy to say.
I mean it.
It is never too late
to change your life.
Robin, now.
Thank you.
You're taking that with you?
When customers get grabby, I like
to have something to whack'em with.
I almost killed a guy with
"War and peace".
So, I'm driving.
This guys pulls out in front of me.
Cuts him off.
I was a little pissed.
You were furious.
But at the stoplight, when I start to
tell the guy off, Tom lays over and says
"Sorry. No big deal.
She's just having a bad day."
You didn't have to
take the guy's head off.
She flipped him the bird.
I was sticking up for you!
Yes, but Tom was driving.
Whether he chose to ignore it
or try to run the man
of the road, it's his decision.
Let him be in the
driver's seat sometimes,
literally and figuratively.
Bringing the score to Tom 4
and controlling bitch 0.
There's no scoreboard
in this room. You know that.
I think you both did
some great work today.
Next Tuesday, same time?
Thanks, doctor.
It felt really great.
Yeah, great.
I always feel so much better
when we get out of there.
I bet you do.
Don't you?
I really think she got this working.
Yeah, I think she's got this working
and this is getting beat up.
Don't feel like that.
It's true. She always sides with you.
I want a second opinion.
Maybe we should think about
seeing another therapist.
When we started, you loved her.
Yeah, and when we started,
I loved you, too.
Things change. Let's go.
Hold on.
I think I left my keys.
I can't.
I have dress rehearsal tonight.
Talk to you later.
I'm sorry. I forgot my keys.
That's okay.
I didn't mean to eavesdrop.
Did you say you had dress rehearsal?
That. Yes, I'm sort of in a little
play that runs this weekend.
Really?
You're an actor, too?
I dabbled in college.
I have a bit of a gift,
so I try to keep it alive.
What's the play?
We'd love to come see it.
"Antony and Cleopatra." But it's
just a community production.
I would never force you
to sit through it.
If you don't want us to come...
Here's a flyer. Matinees are half-off.
I need Ana to watch the girls
while I run to the store
and big shock,
she's not answering her cell.
No problem. Come on in.
They're just up in Danny's room.
Gaby's here!
So they're in Danny's room?
They were listening to music, it was
so loud I made'em shut the door.
So they're by themselves...
with the door shut?
Just a couple of teenagers
alone with their genitals?
Get your ass down here!
What's the big deal? They're
just hanging out in Danny's room.
With a mattress. Why don't you crack
a bottle of champagne on Ana's pelvis
and wish Danny a bon voyage?
Ana! Now!
Hold on. I'm coming.
I'm sure she meant she's on her way.
What's going on?
I have to run.
I need you to watch the girls.
That's it? Jeez, I thought
the house was on fire.
Let me grab my stuff.
So...
you worried they might be doing it?
Yeah. What I don't get is
why you're not worried.
They're healthy, red-blooded kids.
They're gonna do what they're gonna do.
So we say nothing
and just fluff their pillows?
We make sure they don't
do anything stupid.
Have you gotten Ana birth control?
I make her spend time with Juanita and
Celia. I was hoping that would do it.
Come on, Gaby.
You have to talk to her
about safe sex, condoms.
She's only 17.
She's too young!
How old were you
when you first did it?
Ana, hurry up!
Gotta hit the pharmacy, too!
I didn't hear you come in.
"Dearest Bree,
I will always love you,
"but the will to fight on has left me,
so I've chosen to...
exit life on my own terms."
Is this a suicide note?
It's really more
of a suicide rough draft.
I didn't mean for you
to find out this way. But,
now that you know,
we can discuss it like adults.
There is nothing to discuss.
This is obviously
the depression talking.
We will get you some medication.
There's no need for you
to feel badly about this.
I've had a good life.
Let me go.
I will do no such thing.
I forbid this. Do you hear me?
You will not be killing yourself.
I will remove every knife,
rope and pill from this house,
and if I have to, I will be
with you 24 hours a day.
Being bored to death
wasn't how I was planning to go, but,
we can try it your way.
I'll give you some time
to adjust to this.
But understand me.
It's going to happen.
What's with the condoms?
Calm down. They're not for you.
Just what every man wants
to hear from his wife.
So?
Okay, hear me out. You know
how Ana is dating Danny Bolen?
I'm gonna kill him.
We have to be realistic.
With my bare hands.
They're not gonna listen to reason.
And bury him under the porch.
What choice do we have?
They're two teenagers
who are getting seriously involved.
Isn't it better to be safe than sorry?
Its like giving them our blessing.
That's how I felt first, but like Angie
said, nature's gonna take its course.
Easy for her to say.
She's got the boy.
What if the condom breaks?
What if he forgets to put it on?
If he knocks Ana up,
who's gonna end up raising the kid?
God, that'd be awful.
Getting up for those 3:00 AM feedings
after you've worked all day?
Not me. You.
You'll end up
taking care of the baby.
You better convince her to keep her legs
crossed til she's outta this house.
Wait. How is this my problem?
She's your trampy niece.
Because if she gets pregnant,
I'll be in prison for killing
what's buried underneath the porch.
Mrs. D.!
I hope you don't mind
me just showing up, but
I thought about what you said,
and you were right.
It's never too late
to change your life, so,
I quit Double D's.
You did?
I was pretty scared at first, but now
I think it's the best thing I ever did.
That's great.
I never would've had the guts without
talking to you. You're my role model.
Really?
That's sweet.
My old role model was Candi,
down at the club, but she OD'd.
I will try to do Candi proud.
Good for you, Robin.
I know change
takes a lot of courage.
It sure does.
So what do I do now?
You know...
What's my next move?
Where do I work now?
I'm sorry.
You quit without having
anything else lined up?
I know it was a little hasty, but
you said I could do whatever I wanted.
You sounded so sure.
You're still sure, right?
I'm very sure.
The world is your oyster.
You have saved up, right?
She stripped for nine years
and didn't put anything away?
Apparently there was a boob job
and a bad relationship
and the rising cost of glitter.
I have to find a way to help her.
And why is this your responsibility?
Because I'm the one
that told her to quit.
I didn't think she'd listen.
No one listens to me.
I keep telling you how much
I hate that shirt, and there it is.
We'll help her.
What do you have in mind?
We need to find her a job.
What can she do?
Does she have skills
that don't involve picking up
a dollar without using her hands?
Why are you so sad?
I need a job,
and I don't have any skills.
You're so pretty.
You could be a princess.
Look.
MJ is so smitten with her.
He's a guy.
And she's good with kids.
That's it.
They've been looking for an assistant
art teacher down at the school.
She always wanted
to do something like that.
You think she can handle it?
We glue macaroni to shoeboxes.
It's not the hardest job in the world.
How come when I say that,
you give me that look?
And there it is again.
Thanks for cheering me up, MJ.
You're so sweet.
You can give me a bath
if you want to.
You scared the crap out of me.
Where's Orson?
You're supposed to be watching him.
Don't worry.
I stuck him in the laundry room
and put a broom through his spokes.
Can we please cross Roy off
the suicide watch list?
You're alive. My job's done here.
Where have you been? You were
supposed to be back an hour ago.
I am sorry, but I had to stop
and pick up our guests.
What guests?
Orson, meet Chris and Ron.
I know you won't listen to me,
but you might listen to them,
since you have something in common.
Really?
Are you Gilbert and
Sullivan fans, too?
Sense of humor.
That's very important.
I know there's no reason to go
on living, because you're paralyzed...
So you thought, "hey!"
"You know what might cheer him
up? Two more paralyzed guys."
Please. Just hear them out.
If you'll excuse me,
I'm going to make some tea.
So your wife tells us
you in a pretty negative place.
That's to be expected but eventually,
I know you mean well,
but I don't need
a handicapped pep talk.
We're not handicapped.
We're handi-capable.
Oh, Lord!
We play basketball, dance,
we make love.
And I hope
you're very happy together.
I, unfortunately, don't have
someone to join me on this journey.
You have a wife
who clearly loves you.
Paralyzed and blind. You must always be
the first one to board the plane.
We know what you're going through.
A lot of us feel unloved after
something like this happens.
You don't understand.
My wife stays with me solely
out of obligation.
How could you say such a thing?
It's true, isn't it?
You feel guilty because
I never would've been hit by that plane
if I hadn't gotten in
a fist-fight with your lover.
This is the thanks I get?
I have bent over backwards
to make your life easier.
I should just let you hang yourself.
Don't we have
a basketball game at 2:00?
Can you be honest for one moment?
You don't love me.
Yeah, we should go.
Please stay. I've made tea.
See?
You can't deny it.
Go ahead, Bree. Correct me.
Say you love me.
I...
care very deeply for you.
That's what I thought.
I'm feeling
a little upset right now.
Would you mind
rolling yourselves out?
Ana, let me ask you something.
Are you happy?
Why?
Well, Carlos and I
want you to be happy.
Over the last few months, we've come
to thing of you as our own daughter.
Really?
In fact, your uncle
thinks it's about time you
and I had that little talk...
about the birds and the bees.
That's how I feel,
so we're not gonna be doing that.
Instead I'm gonna write you a check.
A check?
A check big enough to cover one
whole year of modeling school...
and to rent a decent-size apartment...
in New York.
Okay, what's the catch?
That's so cute that
you think there's a catch.
This isn't signed.
That's the catch.
I will sign it once you graduate
high school without having had sex
or more sex, as the case may be.
Are you serious?
Ana, I could talk to you about morality
or saving yourself for marriage
or statistics about STDs,
But I think you're the kind of girl
who responds to cold, hard cash.
You know me well.
So do we hava deal?
Are you gonna be a successful
model with a nice apartment
or a teenage mom with no future?
Well...
When you put it like that...
Good girl.
And to answer your earlier question,
I'm now very happy.
I can't believe
I let you talk me into this.
Three hours of Shakespeare
for a woman who has to pee
every 20 minutes.
Dr. Graham's been so supportive of us.
Can't we be supportive of her?
This isn't about support.
This is about
little Tommy teacher's pet
wanting a gold star
for butt-kissing.
That's not true.
Nay, but this dotage...
Please.
You brought her a
40 dollar box of chocolates.
Last mother's day, you threw me a bagel
and called it breakfast in bed.
Admit it. You just have
a problem with her
because you hate it when
someone points out your flaws.
That's not true. I can take
constructive criticism justine.
You're being a little loud.
Sorry.
See? I can take
constructive criticism.
You're still talking.
You're still annoying. Relax.
She's making her entrance.
Grates me... the sum.
Nay! Hear them, Antony!
Fluvia Perchance is angry.
Or... who knows?
If the beard...
If the scarce-bearded Caesar
hath not sent you
his powerful mandate...
"Do this or this.
Take in that kingdom
and enfranchise that.
Perform it.
Or else we damn thee."
How was the play?
Lincoln had a better time
at the theater.
Really? So how bad was it?
You remember how horrible your
second grade arbor day play was?
But at least we were drunk for that.
Honestly,
how did Dr. Graham get that part?
Is she sleeping with the director?
Sleeping with, bathing, donating
a kidney... It's still not enough.
I just hope that I can erase this
from my memory before our next session.
Are you kidding?
We're not seeing her again.
Why not?
We're not going
to continue to take life lessons
from a woman who burped
during her death scene.
That has nothing to do
with her skills as a therapist.
Really? Did she not tell you
she has a "gift" for acting?
Well, I can't trust
the judgment of someone
with absolutely no self-awareness.
We're not going back.
This is an excuse.
You have been looking
for a reason to dump her
ever since our last session.
Tom, I learned two things tonight...
Dr. Graham has no insight
into real human behavior, and,
there are 428 tiles
on the ceiling of that theater.
Say what you want.
We are going to our next session.
And, by the way,
It was 429.
Robin Gallagher, teaching assistant,
reporting for duty.
Look at you!
I wanted to look professional.
Do you like the glasses?
I don't even need them.
You look great.
That's a beautiful suit.
Thanks. It is so nice
to wear work clothes
that don't rip away
to reveal crotchless panties.
Yeah, you're preaching to the choir.
So, I'm just gonna get
the kids started painting.
And why don't you hang those
globes that we made last week?
Can I say something?
You really took a chance on me. No one's
ever done that for me before, so,
thank you.
You're welcome.
I'm really glad you're here.
Careful.
Never let the kids see you cry.
If they sense weakness, you're done.
Sorry we're late.
Forgot his backpack.
That's okay, Mr. Linwood. Come on,
Kyle. Let's get you painting.
Who's that?
That's my new teaching
assistant, Miss Gallagher.
No, Bobby. That's not
how we use pipe cleaners!
I'm sorry.
Do we know each other?
I don't think so.
Are you sure?
You look so familiar.
I guess I just have
one of those faces.
What did you want to see me about?
You are aware, aren't you,
that as a private school,
we depend on the financial
support of our more
affluent parent donors?
I am aware of that.
Good.
Because I just got a call
from Kyle Linwood's father,
a major donor.
Is it true that your assistant
can break a 5 dollars
by shaking out her underwear?
I don't want to take a bath!
Well, that's too bad.
It's time to give the Earth
back some of its dirt. Go!
I'm gonna be upstairs for a bit.
What are you guys up to tonight?
We're just gonna stay home
and study.
Good girl.
Why are you getting me all worked up?
I thought you made your aunt a promise.
I promised her I wouldn't have sex.
I didn't promise you wouldn't.
Fine! I'll sort it myself!
Don't freak out, okay?
What the hell are you doing?
I'm sorry. This won't happen again.
It's no big deal.
You think you can come into
my house and do this?!
Answer me!
Answer me! Answer me!
I catch you near her again,
I will kick your ass, boy.
Let go of him!
You know what I caught
your son doing in my house?
I don't care.
Carlos, what is going on?!
I said let go!
Angie, what the hell?!
Wait for me outside.
Ma, please don't.
Outside!
Look, I came in and
found him on top of her.
I don't care. He's my kid.
You ever touch him again, you're dead.
I see you tried to separate
my glass and plastic.
Suck it, Earth!
Come on, ma. Let's go.
So maybe you shouldn't just think
about what you want to say
But about how you say it,
so Tom can hear you.
That's... a theory.
Is something bothering you?
It's the pregnancy.
This morning she got mad at me
over the way I drank my orange juice.
Is that all?
You know you're in a safe place here.
We can tell each other anything.
Since this is a safe place...
Tom and I saw your play
the other night.
You did? Well, why didn't you
come backstage and say hello?
Well, the truth is, I didn't
know what to say, because...
I didn't really like it.
I know.
Our Antony was dreadful.
You weren't the only one
who thought so.
Actually, I was talking about you.
You were...
really not very good,
and now I've sort of lost confidence
in you as a therapist.
Do you want to elaborate?
No. I think I said
what I needed to say.
See, this is the same thing
in your marriage.
You criticize Tom,
but you won't be specific. It's...
sort of the coward's way out.
Coward?
You sucked.
You were really, really bad.
Three words...
Stink, stank, stunk.
Specific enough?
Good for you, Lynette.
I commend you for your honesty.
Although, the Fairview Herald
had a different take.
They found my Cleopatra
"incandescent."
You actually believe that? See,
this is why we can't see her anymore.
You haven't weighed in yet.
What did you think?
I thought you were great.
What? Liar!
You said you've seen seals
playing horns that put on a better show.
There's no need to bully him
into agreeing with you.
I wouldn't have to bully him
if he would man up for once.
You're attacking.
Of course. Because I'm always
the bad cop, he's always the good cop.
Could you just once
not be such a wuss?
Damn right I'm the good cop.
Someone has to be,
because
bad cop-bad cop doesn't work.
I grew up in that house,
and it doesn't work.
That is not it.
You like me being the bad guy.
That way you can always be
the good guy. But guess what?
I'd love to be the good guy
once in a while, but I can't,
because when things get hard or
a difficult decision has to get made,
You run from confrontation,
and if I don't
step into the void,
things grind to a halt.
Because I got news for you...
Good cop-good cop doesn't work either!
You're right.
Really?
I like to be liked,
and because of that,
A lot of the ugly stuff
I defer to you.
And I'm sorry.
Your performance was
aggressively bad.
At one point during the second act,
I started to choke on a mint
and thought about not fighting it.
Thank you.
Well, this was quite a breakthrough.
And you're right.
You're a wonderful therapist.
Thank you, Lynette.
Now, both of you, get
the hell out of my office.
So we catch her son
on top of our niece,
and we have to apologize?
No, we have to apologize
because you almost put
her son's head through a wall.
When are you gonna learn
violence is not the answer?
I shouldn't have to tell you this!
You know better!
We've been doing it for 19 years.
You're smarter than this!
This is not the first time
we've had this conversation.
I feel like I'm talking
to a wall here, huh?
What is going on here?
What the hell is wrong with you?!
He's ripping Danny a new one.
 Damn it! Angie!
Okay, Nick, just leave me
alone!
No... You are getting sloppy.
We should go.
Yeah, we should.
First you get into it with that
crazy lady about her recycling,
which I told you not to do.
And then guess what?
 She comes over this morning
and she's thinking about suing us.
 I lost my cool.
Get it back!
Cause this rock we are hiding under
is not that big, and if people
start poking around, we're done.
And then, bam! He fires her
for something she used to do.
It's so hypocritical. I mean,
why not get mad at the kid's father?
He obviously goes to Double D's.
I just hope I didn't get you into
any trouble, Mrs. D. I feel awful.
No. This is not your fault.
When I'm sad,
my mom gives me a big hug.
Down, Tiger.
What am I gonna do?
I have no money for rent.
I'm just gonna end up homeless.
You know, maybe I should go
and beg for my old job back.
No. You can't do that.
Quitting that place took a lot of guts.
How do you feel about
letting her move in here?
Julie's gone. We have her empty room.
It's just until she gets on her feet.
You're asking if I'm okay
with letting a stripper live with us?
I'm gonna go with no.
Why not?
I have no idea. I'm just really
sure this is a trick question.
She's a nice girl, and she's in trouble.
You know, I think of myself
as a good person
who cares about others, and,
how often do I actually
get to walk the walk?
This is an opportunity
to really help someone.
I want to do it.
Okay, let's go make ex-stripper
and a little boy very happy.
What's this for?
The Lackeys' 50th anniversary party.
Don't you remember?
I'm sorry. I thought
I'd be dead by now,
so I wasn't paying much attention
to our social calendar.
Well, regardless, you're going.
And if you're still around next Saturday
we've got brunch with my family.
Well, now you're just daring me.
Walter is about to make a toast.
Don't you want to hear it?
A speech about the joys
of wedded bliss?
Pass.
Walter and Shirley are about
to dance to a song
that was played at their wedding.
But before they do,
Walter would like
to say a few words.
I want to thank you all for coming.
50 years...
Would it hardly seems possible.
And now I'm not gonna lie to you
and say it's always been easy.
I mean, we've had
our share of tragedy and
we've said a few things
we wish we could take back.
But for the most part,
we've been lucky,
because no matter how old we get,
we've always been able to remember
what made us fall in love
in the first place, right, hon?
Stop!
Don't you dare throw yourself
in that pool!
I want to die.
Why can't you let me?
Because I want this, too.
I want a party like this someday
to celebrate our life together.
What is there about
our life to celebrate?
Look at Walter and Shirley in there.
I was watching them dance
with such passion in their eyes,
but I know they haven't
always been like that.
They've had their rough times,
too, but they stuck it out.
Because they're in love.
I asked you if you loved me,
and you couldn't answer.
Fine. I'll answer you now.
I loved you once.
Can I love you again?
I don't know.
But I...
would like to recapture
whatonce had.
And how can we do that
if you're not here?
So... I'm asking you...
Please stay.
In this never-ending
drama we call life,
everyone has a part to play.
Some are cast as romantic leads.
Others end up being the victim.
And a few always
provide comic relief.
And then
there are those
who end up playing the hero...
Especially if they feel
there's a villain...
who lives just across the street.
Previously on...
A marriage was on the mend.
I would like to recapture
what we once had.
Gaby and Carlos
discovered a secret.
You are gettin' sloppy!
And if people start
pokin' around, we're done.
And Susan made a request.
You're asking if I'm okay with
letting a stripper leave with us.
The first thing you need to know
about Robin Gallagher
was that everyone liked to look at her.
They would stare at her legs...
and her breasts...
and her hair.
And once they were done,
people would begin to ask...
Who is this?
This is my friend Robin.
Hello there.
Mike had to work today,
so I thought I'd bring her as my plus one.
Hello there.
You already said that.
I wanted her to know I meant it.
It's really good to have you
back on the Lane, Katherine.
It's great to be back. I didn't know
what to expect at first. I
have wondered how everyone
would feel about me, if
they were really ready
to welcome me back. I guess there's always
that fear that people
are going to reject you.
Do I smell appetizers?
I know I do.
Hello, Susan!
Who's your new friend?
Robin, this is Carlos, Tom, Roy and Orson.
Hope you got all that, 'cause
there's gonna be a quiz later.
Oh, God.
So, Robin, welcome to my humble abode.
Thank you.
It's so suburban.
I've never been in a place
where the ceilings were so tall.
Fascinating. Just fascinating.
You live in the city?
I did, but I'll be living
with Susan for a while.
I just moved in today.
Susan, let's get you a drink.
Oh, no, that's okay. I'll wait till... oh!
So...
So how did you meet Susan?
So... you want to tell
us about your new friend
or, uh, should I say "roommate"?
She was down on her luck and
she needed a place to stay.
Plus, I feel responsible,
because I told her to give up her job.
What was wrong with her job?
Well... we probably don't need
to let the guys in on this,
but... Robin was...
That's wild!
So you used to be a stripper?
Yes...
Everyone liked to look
at Robin Gallagher...
But not everyone liked what they saw.
Later,
while the men of Wisteria
Lane were trying the shrimp,
their wives were trying
to control themselves.
You moved a stripper
into the neighborhood?
What were you thinking?
You guys aren't
even taking the time to get to know her.
Our husbands are in there pooling together
their dollar bills. What
more do we need to know?
I just met Robin. She seems great.
Did she mention that she's a stripper?
Did she have to?
Look, I am just trying to
help her get back on her feet.
I bet that'd be a nice change for her.
She is living in my house.
If anybody should be worried, it'd be me,
and I am not threatened by her at all.
Really?
Yes. She's a nice girl.
Yeah, nice, blonde, and you can
bounce a quarter of her ass.
I'm telling you, she's trouble.
Here's a good thing...
she can't bring any more crazy
to this street than I did.
Let's give her a chance.
I agree.
Robin's probably had a tough
life, and she needs our help.
Well, I'm all for being open-minded...
but I have teenage boys at home.
The last thing I need
next door is a stripper.
Hey, Mrs. Scavo. We're
picking up Parker for school.
Please come in. I'll get him for you.
So you ever gonna get back
to folding the laundry?
Well, I thought I'd treat myself
and wash the breakfast dishes first.
Well, you started this. Don't
you think you should finish?
Well, since you're so
passionate about it...
Knock yourself out.
Okay, you just went
from jerk to adorable real quick.
Happy anniversary.
Oh!
It's the ring!
Oh, you went back to that antique shop.
Yep. Oh, thank you!
Wait till you see your present.
You can unwrap it tonight
when the kids are asleep.
Or how about after they leave for school?
Okay. Hey, why are they still up there
and why can't I hear them?
Hey, boys.
What's going on?
Uh, we're late for school.
Oh! Oh, hey, Lynette.
Hi. The next time you take a shower,
do you think you could close your blinds?
I have a 16-year-old
son, and he has friends.
Oh, no.
Oh, yes. You may have
retired from the strip club,
but you're still doing seven shows a week.
I mean,
at least they didn't
have to pay *** right?
This is a nice community.
You have a responsibility
to the neighbors,
especially the ones
with innocent children.
Well, they're not all so innocent.
Excuse me?
Yesterday that son of yours
asked me if I would have sex with him.
Parker?
My Parker?
Red hair, skinny,
still-sleeps-in-a-bed-shaped-like-a-racecar
Parker?
Of course I said no.
Then he offered me cash.
Come in.
Have a seat.
What's up?
Something wrong?
We hoped it would be another year
before we had the parent-son conversation
where we tell you not to offer
your neighbor money for sex.
But...
Oh, crap. She told?
Yeah.
You might want to pick a more
discreet stripper next time.
What were you thinking?
We raised you better than that. Didn't we?
Yeah, we did.
We did. So... what do you
have to say for yourself?
I just really, really, really...
Needed to have sex.
Three "reallys." Well, in that case,
here's a $20. Go back and try again.
You are a
16-year-old boy.
We understand your hormones
are holding your brain hostage,
but why would you think you
would need to pay for sex?
Because I'm the only one of my friends
who hasn't lost his virginity.
Oh.
First of all, we've
and trust me, "pimples," "braces"
and "beam me up, Scotty"
are not gettin' any.
Girls don't look at me that way.
It's never gonna happen.
Knock it off!
You are a great kid!
You don't need to pay for it.
In a few years,
when you're emotionally ready,
you'll meet the right girl,
and you will have tons of sex.
After you're married.
Okay, dad.
Sorry.
Nice job.
Thank you.
You think he bought it?
Bought what?
You know.
Guys always pay for sex in some way...
I mean, dinner, flowers...
antique rings.
Whoa. Whoa.
You think that's the only
reason we're having sex tonight?
Of course not. It's our anniversary.
It's a given, like turkey on Thanksgiving.
Although I am hoping
that the ring gets me an
upgrade from missionary.
Forget about upgrades. You
just got bumped off the flight.
Honey, wh...  why are
you getting so upset?
Because I didn't know I was married
to such a cynical lug nut.
Wait. Are we really not
gonna have sex tonight?
Don't worry, Tom.
In a few years, when
you're emotionally ready,
you're gonna have tons of sex.
Come on!
So you really like that ring?
Yep.
Did you read the inscription?
"To my darling... "
We're not having sex, Tom.
Oh, come on. Why not?
Because I am still upset by what you said.
Do you really think
women only sleep with men
if they buy them things?
No. I think supermodels sleep
with 80-year-old millionaires
because they love to hear stories
about when bread was 5 cents a loaf.
Well, I'm not a model,
and you're no millionaire,
so I'm thinking you owe me an apology.
You and I went to Marley's tavern
on our first two dates,
and I could barely get
past a good night kiss.
But third time out, I dropped 200
bucks at La Rive Gauche, and bam!
You finally put out.
Finally made love.
Listen, you idiot!
I did not "put out" because you
bought me an expensive dinner.
I did it because you showed up
for the date with a lightbulb
to replace the one that had burned out
in the hallway to my apartment. Remember?
You said I didn't live
in the best neighborhood.
And I was worried about you.
Bingo. I was ready to do
you right then and there.
Really?
That's all it takes?
Me showing you I care?
'Cause that's easy.
And now it's time for
your anniversary present.
Hey, Robin.
Remember the other day
when I told you this
was a nice neighborhood?
I forgot to warn you...
there's this one bitch
that lives right nearby,
and that would be me.
Look, I understand.
An ex-stripper moving next
door will freak some people out.
No. Seriously, I'm sorry.
Apology accepted.
Oh, and, uh, by the way...
Oh. Yeah?
The next time you're
giving it to your husband
with the lights on,
could you draw the drapes?
And Roy offered to take me to the park.
Oh. Well, isn't that lovely?
Do you wanna watch a movie?
Well, I guess I'll read...
I guess we could watch a movie.
No. No, no. If you want to read, go ahead.
Good night.
If you need anything,
just ring the bell. I'm...
right upstairs.
I... I'm sure I'll be fine.
Knock, knock.
Robin. Come on in.
Can I ask you a favor?
Sure.
Susan and Mike have been so good to me.
I wanna do something nice
for them, and I thought,
hey, maybe I should bake them a cake.
Oh, that's very thoughtful.
Well, feel free to use whatever you need.
Thank you.
So what do I need?
Robin, what exactly do
you know about cakes?
Well, I know that if
you're gonna hide in one
for more than an hour,
the air holes have got to be pretty big.
All right, then.
It looks like I will be
teaching you how to make a cake.
Oh, yay! You rock, Bree!
I rock.
Now the key to success
is following the recipe exactly.
The secret to baking is precision.
Got it. You're my hero.
What are you doing?
Making you my screensaver.
Oh, that's sweet.
You're replacing my
cat. He's eating noodles.
Let's just do this.
Okay.
Go get yourself an apron.
That is, like, the coolest
cake I've ever seen.
Raspberry mocha.
Orson's favorite.
I talked to him at the party. He's nice.
It must be tough having
him in a wheelchair.
It's been challenging.
Well, they say you can
get through anything
if you have a solid marriage.
Yes, well...
Oh. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to pry.
It's fine.
Let's just say before his
accident there were issues,
and now we're trying to put
the pieces back together.
Well, that's good for you.
So what's the piece you can't find?
Ah! Now you are prying.
What?
We did make a cake together.
Look, my grandmother always said
that if you wanna save your marriage,
there's only one room to do it in.
The bedroom.
Yeah, I got that.
It's not about sex.
It's about... closeness.
We've lost our intimacy.
Oh. Honey.
Sex is how men get intimate.
Well, I'm not even sure he's capable.
Oh, it doesn't matter.
His brain still works.
And he can see you. He
can feel you touch him.
He can hear what you say to him.
You know, I had this regular customer...
92 years old, in a wheelchair.
I used to have to push the
oxygen tank out of the way
to give him a lap dance.
I don't know if he's even interested.
Well, here's the thing.
Neither of us knows for sure,
but only one of us can find out.
Hello, dear.
How was the bar mitzvah?
A boy became a man,
and a rabbi blessed my cream.
Same old, same old. How was your day?
Oh, I've been passing the time reading.
Well, I suppose I should
get out of these clothes.
Oh! Peter Tchaikovsky. God bless you.
Yes. I never tire of this piece.
It's extraordinary, so moving, so...
Sensual.
Don't you wanna do that upstairs?
You know, near the hamper.
Actually, I'd rather do it...
Right... here.
Why are you walking like that?
Why do you think?
I'm not sure.
You're trying to make me feel
better about being paralyzed?
Guess again, big boy.
Well, if you're having a stroke,
we're gonna make quite the team.
I do believe it's getting...
hot in here.
Are you all right?
Yeah. Just a second. My earring's caught.
Enjoy the music.
Oh, let me help.
No, no, no. I'm good. Stay
there. I'm coming over.
No, Orson, I've got it.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I told you I didn't need any help!
Well, in my defense, that
wasn't entirely clear.
Forget it. This was stupid.
What was that?
What do you think? It was a lap dance!
That was a lap dance?
I was trying to arouse you.
You are aware I'm in wheelchair?
Well, I thought
you still might be interested in that sort of thing.
I am!
Well, you certainly don't act like it.
After the accident,
I just never thought you
would ever consider...
Oh, Orson.
Things will be awkward at first,
but we can work on it.
You're my husband.
I wanna be close to you.
I wanna share your bed
again, even if it means
just holding your hand
before you fall asleep.
Come here.
Is this all right?
Let's see...
I've got Tchaikovsky on the stereo,
my wife in my arms.
She and Danny spent
the whole day together.
What's left to say?
This is out of control. Let's
forbid Ana to talk to him.
Yeah, forbid two teenagers,
that always works.
Besides, what would we say...
we overheard his parents talking
and we think they're evil?
What do you think the Bolens did?
I don't know,
but you don't go on the run
for not paying your cable bill.
They've been cagey ever
since they moved in.
And Nick doesn't work.
How do they have money?
Maybe they're drug dealers or gun runners.
Whatever they are, I don't want
Ana anywhere near that family.
She won't break up with him.
She will if we make her.
I told you that won't work.
We need to come up with
a carrot, not a stick.
Ana.
Privacy, please.
I've got big news.
For me or for you?
You!
Oh.
I just got a call from my
good friend Luke Rayfield.
I was a struggling model in New York
when he was a struggling photographer.
Well, mostly I was his beard
for all his family functions.
There was this one time...
Is the part about me coming up?
Oh, yeah.
Anyway, Luke now has
his own modeling agency,
and he's always looking for new talent,
so I sent him your picture.
Wait for it! Wait for it.
He wants to represent you.
You may now begin screaming.
Oh, I have to call Danny!
Oh, well, you know what? Danny can wait.
We need to go buy you some new luggage.
They want you in New York immediately.
Now? But, uh, don't I
have to finish high school?
World war II... Germany lost.
Korean war... Korea lost.
Vietnam war... we lost. Happy graduation.
What's wrong?
I... I don't think I can go just yet.
Why not?
Danny and I have a plan.
We're going to New York
together when I graduate.
After everything I've done for her...
"Danny and I are moving to New York
after I graduate. We're in love!"
Pour me some more wine
before I throw up.
What's wrong?
Oh, Gaby got her niece a foot in
the door for a model crew,
and she's turning it down.
Oh, bad call.
I used to take ballet, and
I was pretty good at it, too.
And one time, this instructor
from a big ballet company
saw me perform, and...
oh, long story short,
two days later they offered me a job.
What happened?
Bobby Butterfield happened.
A boy.
Not just a boy.
The boy.
Oh, I was crazy about him,
thought it was gonna last forever.
So I passed on the job.
And two months later, he
dumped me for Louise McMullen.
And then a month after that,
I got into a car accident,
messed up my knee,
and then it was good-bye,
tutu. Hello ta-tas.
That is fantastic!
Did we just hear the same story?
You have got to tell that story to Ana.
Putting off your dreams
and then having your life
spiral down the crapper?
It couldn't be more perfect.
Well, I... I guess I could talk to Ana,
if you think it would help her.
Great. And don't be afraid
to turn on the waterworks.
Nothin' sells pathetic
like stripper tears.
Maybe it would help
if I started taping you
so you could hear what it is you say.
Don't be discouraged
if Luke starts you off
with catalogue work.
Just try to get your face in the shot.
A little tough to do with a lawn mower,
I was texting you.
Oh, I was just coming over.
Oh. Taking a trip?
I'm... sure you two
have a lot to talk about.
So I'll just take these inside for you.
Bye, Danny.
What do you need luggage for?
I was just about to come
over and tell you right now.
When did this happen?
I just found out, okay?
Ana, I thought we were
supposed to go together.
Why can't you wait?
This is a huge opportunity.
You should be saying,
"great, Ana. Go for it."
If you can't support me,
then maybe we shouldn't even be together.
Hey! Hey, Robin!
Oh, hi. What's up?
I've been meaning to thank you.
You little speech to
Ana worked like a charm.
I just took her to the airport.
Great.
Mm-hmm. So, uh, why was she fighting
with Danny Bolen yesterday?
They were breaking up.
They were dating?
Yeah. That's the whole reason
I wanted you to talk to her,
to convince her she was
screwing up her life,
so I could ship her off to New York
and get her away from Danny.
You didn't tell me that.
Ok, so?
So I don't like being used.
Oh, don't get upset, you did good.
Ana's gone. Danny's out of the picture.
I owe ya big time.
Danny.
Hey, I think we need to talk.
Sorry. It's really not a good time.
Actually, this is exactly the time.
I just talked to Luke.
Ana has settled into her dorm,
she's got all her classes lined up,
and he's taking her
new head shots tomorrow.
And the best part is,
she is miles away from the nearest Bolen.
Oh, perfect timing.
Something smells good.
Thank you.
Just putting on the finishing
touches before we eat.
Oh, you spoil me.
What's wrong?
Is it your back again?
Yeah. I spent all day
working in a crawl space.
I'll call the chiropractor
first thing in the morning.
No need for that. I can fix it.
Come here.
Oh, wait! Wait! Wait!
Wait! What are you doin'?
At Double D's, the girls were
constantly throwing their backs
from sliding down that pole.
They all came to see me.
Now just relax, and one, two, three.
There. How do you feel?
Oh, my God. It's gone.
The pain's gone.
Wow! Uh, thank you, Robin.
I... I was just gonna give him a scotch
and make him sleep in the guest room.
Seriously, you really fixed me up.
Thanks.
Oh, please.
After all you guys have done for
me, it's the least I can do.
I'm home!
In here!
No fast food tonight! Fire up the...
Microwave.
Hey.
My back went out again.
Robin tried cracking it, but
it just didn't go deep enough.
This is the way the buddhist monks do it.
It's the only way to get
through all that muscle.
Is there a problem, babe?
No. No problem.
It looks like you're in good hands.
Or... feet.
So I'll just, uh, go make dinner.
Happy trails!
How does that feel?
Oh! Yeah, yeah, do that! Do that!
Can you handle a little more?
Oh! Give me all you got.
So I, uh, ran into Janice White today.
Says her husband is sick.
Oh, wow, you're really stiff.
Okay, let me try something else.
Oh, you're the boss.
Apparently, it's bacterial,
and he's, uh, bloating like a pig.
I'm gonna grab it and pull.
Go for it!
And there's a lot of diarrhea!
Oh, yes! Ohh! Yes!
Ohh, yes!
This is incredible.
Those monks really
know what they're doing.
Oh, yeah.
When do they find time to pray?
Hey! I'm on my way to school.
The faculty volunteered to make
sandwiches for the homeless.
Okay, well, I'll, uh, see you later.
What's the matter?
I, uh, re-piped an entire
house. Even my hair hurts.
Aw, you poor thing. You
want the heating pad?
No. No, I'll be okay.
Well, I won't be gone long. Feel better.
I'll just have Robin crack
my back when she gets home.
Or I could stay here and do it.
What about the homeless?
Please. They've gone
this long without food.
What's another ten minutes?
Susan, do you have a problem
with Robin working on me?
Of course not.
But she's not here, and you're in pain.
So why don't you let me take a shot at it?
A shot at it? We're
talking about my spine.
Mike, Robin didn't exactly
go to medical school
between lap dances.
I saw what she did. I
can do the same thing.
Okay. Here we go.
Ow? No "ow." That's
exactly what Robin did.
No, she didn't yank it.
It's my arm, not an emergency brake.
Shh. Just take a deep breath.
The key is relaxation. Okay.
One... two...
You know, if you hadn't
moved when I said "three"...
Just go.
Oh, my God, Susan. Is
Mike gonna be all right?
Can I see him?
Sure, sweetie.
Just don't climb on the bed.
Look, why didn't you wait for me?
I would've taken care of
Mike's back, no problem.
Well, I wanted to do it myself.
Oh. Okay.
I'm lying. I didn't wanna do it.
I just really wanted you not to do it.
I don't understand.
God, I've been trying really
hard to be cool about all this.
But when I walked in and
I saw you all over Mike...
When... when I was cracking his back?
I was just trying to help.
While you wearing next to nothing
and straddling my husband.
How was I supposed to react?
You used to be a stripper.
Oh, don't cry. Why are you crying?
Strippers are supposed to be tough.
Stop calling me that.
Yes, I was a stripper.
But you know what?
You were the only person who
never treated me like one,
until now.
Oh.
And I'm really sorry if I
crossed the line with Mike.
You know, I guess after
working nine years in the club,
I just don't know where
the line is anymore.
Uh, it's...
I... I overreacted.
Maybe I should move out.
No. Robin, you don't have to do that.
I want us to be friends
for a very long time.
So, yes, I do.
Hello.
Hi. Susan asked me to
bring you some of your mail.
Oh, thank you.
I'm Robin. We met at your party.
Yeah, I remember.
How's it going?
Oh! I take it you heard
about my little vacation
at Fairview behavioral.
Yes. I heard.
Well, to be honest,
it's been hard,
especially coming back
to this big, empty house.
Not to mention the subtle glances I get
from people judging me.
But you know what I
say? To hell with them.
Thank you.
I'll see you.
Oh, hey, and if this
house gets too lonely,
I'm looking for a room to rent.
I mean, Mike and Susan are great,
but it's gettin' a
little crowded over there.
Okay, I'll keep it in mind.
Mm, for what it's worth,
it might take the heat off of you.
No one judges the woman
from the looney bin
when there's a stripper next door.
This is great.
I haven't had a female roommate since...
After college.
Let's hear it for girl power!
You know, we should go out
and have a drink to celebrate.
Oh, I don't know.
My therapist says I
should get out more, but...
Even being over at Gaby's
house the other day, it's...
It's just hard.
Yeah, I get that.
So what was it like being
in a mental hospital?
You know...
as much fun as one would expect.
I only ask 'cause of my mom.
She used to use me as a punching bag,
and I always dreamed
about having her committed.
I'm sorry.
Oh. No, it was only when she was drunk.
It was her way of coping
with my dad cheating on her all the time.
I remember wishing that he was ugly
so other women wouldn't want him.
But he looked like Clint Eastwood.
Anyway, mom had to take
out her anger somewhere,
and I was an easier
target than a 6'4" trucker.
Actually...
It was pretty bad at the hospital.
People always say it's the
screaming that gets to you.
But at least screaming
means you're alive, you know?
What I couldn't take
were the people with the blank stares.
There was this one woman
who sat frozen in the garden all day,
whispering the words to
"old MacDonald had a farm"
over and over and over.
The doctors ever take
offense when she got to
"here a quack, there a quack,
everywhere a quack-quack"?
You know what?
If there were ever two people
who deserved a night out drinking...
It's us.
Okay...
Quid pro quo.
I told you what it was like
to go to bed in restraints,
so I think it's only fair
that you tell me what it
was like being a stripper.
Ooh. It was brutal.
If I had a dollar for every
guy that slapped me on my butt
just 'cause he felt like it...
Come to think of it, I do.
Excuse me. Uh, my friend
and I were wondering
if you'd like to join us at our table.
No, thank you. It's girls night out.
Two beautiful women in a bar.
Can't blame a guy for asking.
Uh, we're over there if
you decide to go coed.
Is it bad that I wanna go sit with them?
You do?
Yeah!
It's been a while since a guy
that cute has flirted with me.
You know what? Let's do it.
Really?
Yes. You look way too hot
to waste it on just me.
Shall we?
Come on. You've gotta have a secret.
Nope. It's shampoo and conditioner.
Well, it looks amazing.
You should be on the
cover of hair magazines.
What is it you said you do?
I didn't.
But my friend Katherine is starting
her own catering company.
Oh, well, thinking about it.
Cooking's a passion of mine.
But a lot has to happen
before I start my own business.
I know. You're a model.
No.
Oh. Uh... dental hygienist?
No.
Oh, I know. You're a flight attendant.
You may as well tell me,
or I'm just gonna keep guessing all night.
She's a stripper, okay?
Ex-stripper. I'm sorry.
Oh, hey, why are you
apologizing? We love strippers.
Yeah. They're like angels of mercy...
that show their boobs.
We should probably get going.
W... what are you talking about?
We haven't even danced yet.
Oh, I don't really feel like dancing,
although I can't speak for Katherine here.
Well, it's just, I wanna dance with you.
You're not attracted to
someone who's classy, witty,
not to mention breathtakingly beautiful?
No offense to your friend,
but you're more my type.
Oh. Well, in that case,
I guess I'll just keep her all to myself.
Night, guys.
God...
The look on their faces...
Oh, I know.
It was the perfect combo
of "I am so turned on"
and "I am so going home alone."
You should remember that
the next time you want
to get out of a bad date.
Oh, no, I don't think so.
Those two pigs confirmed
what I've been thinking for a while now...
I think it's time for
me to give up on men.
Mm. Amen, sister.
It's official. My dating days are over.
I mean, you don't have
to take it that far.
You could always just do what I did
and explore other options.
What do you mean?
Cast a wider net?
Expand the pool?
Date chicks?
So you're...
Yep.
Card-carrying.
I thought that kiss
felt awfully convincing.
Well, I mean, I dated
guys for a long time and...
I just never really felt a connection.
And then I started stripping,
and I was surrounded by all
these confident, sexy women,
and I realized,
"Robin, sweetie, you have been
barking up the wrong tree."
Yeah, I think I got the right tree.
Just sick of barking.
Well, suit yourself.
Uh, you're okay with this, right?
I mean, it's not gonna
affect anything with us?
I... I don't see why it would.
Okay.
Hey, Robin. What are you up to?
Just out for a walk. It's such a nice day.
Yeah, it is. So how do
you like the neighborhood?
Is everyone treatin' you okay?
I guess so.
No one's giving you any guff
about being a stripper,
are they?
Oh, no.
I just wanna make sure, 'cause
trust me, I've been there.
Way back when, I was sorta
in the sex trade myself.
Oh, yeah.
I used to model women's
foundation garments
for Sears & Roebuck.
These breasts put me through college.
They're real, by the way.
They look real.
Yeah.
Anyway, I'm glad that
people are treating you nice.
You know what the best part is?
They actually see me.
See you?
I spent a lot of years
working in a place where people
stared at me all night long.
But no one ever really... saw me.
You know what I mean?
I do.
And when I first got here,
I thought it was gonna
be the same thing. But...
I get the feeling your neighbors
see past all the stuff
that people usually look at.
It makes me feel really good.
I'm glad.
Robin Gallagher was right.
The people she had met on Wisteria Lane
had really looked at her,
and they had seen her sense of morality,
her loyal heart...
Her surprising insight,
her forgiving nature.
Some people had even taken notice
of her incredible beauty...
and they were surprised to discover
they liked what they saw.

Previously...
All right. I love you.
There, I said it.
Feelings were stated boldly.
It's time for me to give up on man.
You can always just do what I did.
A romantic suggestion was made.
Date chicks?
And a plan was hatched...
He wants to represent you.
They want you in New York
immediately.
To break up a romance...
This is a huge opportunity.
The best part is she is miles away
from the nearest Bolen.
But young love couldn't be stopped.
Since she'd become a mother,
Gabrielle Solis had
learned many things...
How to get gum
off a remote control...
How to rescue a doll
from the disposal...
And where to find
disappointing report cards.
Gabrielle had also learned
that no matter how hard she tried...
Cereal again?
She couldn't please everyone.
Another free meal
you didn't have to work for.
It's tough being 7.
Celia, get down here!
Ana used to make us bacon.
I miss her.
She also used to do the laundry
and the windows, so I miss her more.
Celia, the milk is poured!
I need cupcakes for school today.
Today? How many?
Mom!
Three dozen.
Why didn't you tell me this
last night?
I forgot. We got any ham?
I need meat.
Are you gonna pick up
my suit from the dry cleaners?
Yes, after I fold the laundry,
fry up some ham
and pull three dozen
cupcakes out of my ass!
Mom!
What?!
My face itches.
What are those, mosquito bites?
That looks like chicken pox.
I don't have time for sick kids!
Forget the dry cleaning.
You gotta take her to the doctor.
What do you do for chicken pox?
I've never had 'em.
What? Stop!
Why?
You can't go near her.
You're not immune.
In fact, you gotta get out of here.
Celia is sick.
Chicken pox is dangerous for adults.
Go!
I have to do the laundry,
I've got dishes.
I will take care of the house.
Yes, Gabrielle had learned
many things as a mother.
The most important...
See ya.
Was to get while the
getting was good.

Seduction...
Any soap opera fan will tell you,
it's an art best practiced...
Stop.
... On those who are vulnerable.
Hey there.
You hungry?
I am now.
What's that amazing smell?
Cinnamon brioche french toast.
But I probably shouldn't.
You're such an amazing cook.
I'm already having trouble
fitting into my clothes.
You need some maple syrup.
Seriously, you heated the syrup?
You're unbelievable.
You should eat it
while it's still...
Hot.
Look.
I just got syrup all over me.
I don't know what it is with me.
I just... have to get dirty.
You...
Got some on your bra, too.
I'll get it.
Please. It's wrong.
Then why does it feel so right?
Katherine? You up yet?
Good. I was calling,
but you didn't hear me.
I think you feel
asleep with the tv on.
What would you like for breakfast?
Anything but french toast.
I don't think you'll
be here that long.
I got it.
I got the perfect name for the baby.
Patricia.
Let me think about it.
Why not? It's a great name.
I told you, I want to honor my aunt.
We're naming her Polly.
Polly?
You get a peg leg,
I'll get an eye patch,
and we'll carry her
around on our shoulders.
Morning, Penny.
Hey, baby.
Where are my pancakes?
Sweetie, I've got a lot going on today.
I'll make you pancakes this weekend.
But I always get
pancakes on my birthday.
That's... Right.
You do.
But...
We... Have...
an even bigger treat
planned for you this year.
What?
Like I'm gonna tell ya
and ruin the big surprise!
How could you forget her birthday?
Me? I'm pregnant.
I forget pants sometimes.
What's your excuse?
What's my surprise?
What are we gonna do?
Cover me. I'm going in.
Birthday breakfasts...
are for kids.
Now that you're 11,
I was planning to make you...
the best...
birthday... dinner ever,
with decorations...
Tons of presents...
Pin the tail on the...
You forgot my birthday.
There was no covering that, babe.
You're twice the man he is.
What's Raymundo gonna say when he finds
out Tiffany's sleeping with his brother?
Alas, you'll never know.
We were just taking a break.
So I gathered.
If you don't mind,
Tad, I'd like to my son.
Sure, go ahead.
In private, Tad.
So you want me to...
Be anyplace else but here, right.
So what's up?
There's a truck outside with the flower
arrangements for the Adams party.
All 100 of them.
Wait. But we only ordered ten.
That's what I said.
Then the delivery man
showed me this invoice.
At first I wasn't sure
if that was Tad's signature
but when I saw that his
name was misspelled...
I knew it was him.
Would you like me to talk to him?
I'd like you to hold him down while
I strike him with a large wooden spoon.
Whatever. I'll take care of it.
What are you going to say to him?
When Orson had his accident,
did you or did you not put me in charge?
Yes, but I am starting
to think that you're not ready.
I'm never gonna figure this
job out unless you let me make mistakes
and learn from them.
I realize that, but you're...
I know you have your control issues,
but when stuff happens,
you'll have to learn to relax
and let me clean up my own messes.
Where do you want all
these flower arrangements?
No problem, Tad.
As luck would have it,
we've got extra.
Roy, we've got guests.
You can watch your soap later.
Come on, Roy.
Again, thank you for inviting us over
to brunch. Everything looks delicious.
It does, doesn't it?
Right, Karen?
You know what I want.
When company comes over,
I get to use salt.
Roy's on a low-sodium diet.
"No sodium" is code for "
tastes like socks."
So sue me 'cause I don't
want you dropping dead.
Listen to you two. You sound
like a sweet, old married couple.
Have you ever thought of
making an honest woman out of Karen?
What are you doing?
I just want them to
be as happy as we are.
We're happy.
Living in sin suits us just fine.
Is that how Karen feels?
Susan,
why don't you try this frittata?
Karen don't care about marriage.
Do you, pumpkin?
Here.
Have some more salt.
I always figured you'd say no.
So why don't you grow
a pair and find out?
Are you serious?
Of course she's serious.
Fine.
Mike, give me a hand, will you?
Oh, my god! This is so romantic.
Karen, will you...
Son of a bee.
There's the battery to my hearing aid.
Do you wanna marry me?
Golly, I don't know what to say.
This is all so sudden.
Answer. My knee hurts.
I would love to marry you, Roy.
If Gaby's staying just a couple of days,
why'd she bring three suitcases?
She said most of her dresses
haven't had chicken pox either.
That... was amazing.
I just took a nap in
the middle of the day.
Guess it's different without kids.
You kidding me?
I haven't taken a nap
since Juanita crowned.
You created a visual that is forbidden
inside these walls. Try to watch that.
Here. You're just in time
for pre-dinner cosmos.
In a crystal glass?
Celia broke our
last one six months ago.
I've been drinking my cocktails
out of a scooby-doo sippy cup.
I'm in heaven.
So it's movie night.
Have you seen this?
Does it have a talking penguin
or a dog that plays basketball?
Gratuitous sex and lots of violence.
Yay, art!
Somebody's glass is empty.
That's also forbidden
inside these walls.
I know I don't know you
guys that well, but...
I love you.
Are you okay?
All right, it's time for cake.
I got your favorite.
Chocolate?
I got your second favorite.
Mom?
Yes?
I have a date in half
an hour. Can I go now?
You cannot go.
Preston's in Europe.
Parker's at band practice.
You are representing all siblings.
Don't you feel bad we
forgot her birthday?
I didn't. I gave her
a present this morning.
So don't take it out on me that
you and dad failed as parents.
We used up all our good parenting
on you. That's why you're so delightful.
Here we go!
One, two, three...
Who's Polly?
Oh, my god!
Erase, erase, erase.
Sweetie, I am so sorry.
I don't know if you know this, but
pregnant women get a little scattered.
And then your dad and I were
talking about baby names,
and I got on the phone
with the bakery, and...
Which is clearly a terrible excuse,
and again, I am so sorry.
Let me fix this.
That just made it worse,
and how would you like a puppy?
Forget it.
But you haven't opened
your presents yet.
Come back...
Penny.
I know her name.
What's going on?
Danny took off. Listen to this...
"Didn't want to wake you.
Went camping with Eddie.
"Had to clear my head
about the Ana thing.
P.S. Took my cell,
but doubt we'll have reception."
Good for him.
Are you crazy?
He's never been by himself.
He knows how to drink out of
a canteen and pee on a tree.
I think he'll be fine.
This isn't funny.
Should he have asked us?
Yeah.
But I think it's healthy.
HeBetter hiking with Eddie than alone
in his room with a bottle of pills.
I don't know.
He's 19. Eventually,
we gotta let him live a normal life.
He's never gonna have a normal life.
None of us will.
I realize the mistake
was ours, mr. Tanble,
but what am I supposed to do
with 90 extra floral arrangements?
It will be your problem
if I stop doing business with you.
Yes. What can I do for you?
Actually, the question
is what can I do for you?
Sorry. Did we have an appointment?
No, but I've been wanting to
meet you for such a long time,
and when I woke up this morning,
I told myself today is the day.
May I sit?
Not just yet.
What is it you want, mister...
Allen. Sam Allen.
I've been following
your career for a while.
Been to some parties you've catered,
got your cookbook,
read every interview you've done,
and you're quite amazing.
How nice. Let's skip to
the part where you assure
you're not a deranged stalker.
Hardly. I want to work for you.
Doing what?
Anything. Everything.
I'm very busy, mr. Allen. You could
leave your resume with my assistant...
I worked as a sous-chef to put
myself through business school,
where I graduated first.
I know my way around a
kitchen and a calculator.
And I'm not asking you to pay me
a lot of money, not yet anyway.
I want to learn your
business from the ground up,
and then I want to
help you expand it.
Really?
You're a woman who has something
to say about traditional values,
and I think our country's
ready to listen.
I am flattered...
But I'm also fully staffed,
and I honestly wouldn't know
how to use you.
I'm sorry.
So am I.
In regard to the extra arrangements,
you could donate them to a hospital
and record the loss as a
charitable contribution.
And if you split the
arrangements in half,
you could double the
amount you claim.
Just a thought.
Mr. Allen?
Now you can sit.
Where's your blushing bride?
Upstairs in the can.
What do you want?
I thought I would drop this off.
It's a bouquet I found. Don't
you think it'll be perfect for Karen?
Haven't you done enough already?
We had a good thing going-
me and Karen.
Now 'cause of you, we're gonna
get married and ruin it.
Getting married isn't gonna ruin it.
It's gonna make it better.
No, it isn't. It's like salt.
What?
All my life,
I never cared about salt,
but when my doctor said I
couldn't have it anymore,
I started craving it.
Wait...
You telling me that...
You're gonna cheat on Karen?
I go to a stretching
class at the center.
There's a lady with blue hair,
always sits in front of me.
Six months she's been there.
I never gave a crap about her.
But this morning,
48 hours after you told me
I had to propose to Karen,
I'm looking at ol'blue hair,
and I'm smacking my lips.
Salt.
You're 80 years old, Roy.
Infidelity is...
Dangerous.
My body's 80,
but inside,
I'm still a randy teenage boy.
Susan, I'm telling ya,
I have to kiss some other
women before I die.
You can't, so forget it!
Just think about Karen and
how much she loves you,
And if you do that,
I'm sure you'll be able to resist
any inappropriate urges.
Yeah, that's the stuff.
How is your wife
being molested funny?
It was just a kiss from
an 80-year-old man.
Too bad he didn't grab my ass.
You'd be rolling on the floor.
What do you want me to do, beat him up?
Take the tennis balls off his walker?
Forget about me.
What about what he's doing to Karen?
They're about to get married, and
he has no intention of being faithful.
Because he feels trapped.
And whose fault is that?
Don't point the mustard at me.
I was there.
You practically forced him into this.
I made a mistake. I didn't know that
he was some sort of jurassic gigolo.
I have to tell Karen
about this right now.
No. You've meddled enough.
I can't let her marry him,
knowing what I know.
He's having second thoughts.
There's not a married man on earth who
didn't have that before he got married.
Oh, really?
I didn't mean...
Okay, I'm done.
See ya, boys! Thanks for driving!
Don't forget to friend us!
I won't, Fernando.
And good luck with
your pec implants.
All right, time for a nightcap.
Nightcaps! I'd forgotten
all about nightcaps.
I miss the gay single life.
You know what?
She deserves the full experience.
We're gonna throw you a party.
Brilliant! I have mini
quiches in the freezer
and ten homos on speed dial.
It's done.
I'm so excited!
Invite those guys from tonight...
Except Fernando.
He's prettier than me.
Hi. It's Bob. * and Lee.
Leave a message.
Hey, guys. It's Carlos.
I'm looking for Gaby.
Doctor says the girls aren't contagious
anymore, so she can come home.
Thanks.
That's good news.
What?!
That is horrible news.
My children are healthy. Damn it!
But you can go home now.
I'm not ready.
I'm just starting to remember
what it's like to be human again...
Sleeping in, not stepping on toys,
eating at restaurants
that don't have a slide.
I have tasted freedom,
and I am not ready to give it up!
But what are you gonna tell Carlos?
A stomach virus?
When you called earlier,
I was throwing up.
We don't want the girls to catch it.
What's that noise?
My teeth are chattering.
Anyhow, I'll be home
as soon as I can.
Doctor says it's a 24-hour thing.
Don't forget the hangover.
Or 36-hour thing. Gotta go.
Start pourin'.
I said I was throwing up.
Don't want to be a liar.
I can hire whomever I want.
It's my company.
And I run it for you.
I should've been consulted.
Why are you being so unpleasant
about this? I hired Sam to help you.
I don't need his help.
I've got it under control.
All I've seen lately
is evidence to the contrary,
And if you think I'm gonna stand by
while everything I've built falls apart.
I thought you'd gone home.
I stayed late to finish the inventory.
Aren't you industrious?
I also wanted to talk about Tad.
What about him?
Every task I've given him he's
either botched or failed to finish.
I think it's time to cut our losses.
We're not firing Tad.
Why not? He's a moron.
He's a good guy,
and I don't want you talking
that way about my employees.
Andrew, you have to admit,
he's more than a little incompetent.
Give him a chance. He's just a kid.
You're having an affair with him,
aren't you?
How could you say such a thing?
I think the more
pertinent question is
why isn't Andrew denying it?
Have you had sex with Tad?
Just once.
He came on to me.
It was late, and I'd been drinking.
That's your excuse?
Honestly,
I am so disappointed in you.
Really? You want to play that card?
You're living with Alex.
And you're married to Orson.
I know about Karl Mayer.
Hello, pot. I'm kettle.
It's nice to meet you.
I can't believe you'd bring
this up in front of a stranger.
You know me. Hypocrisy
just makes me forget my manners.
Perhaps I should go.
Yes.
But I want you back here bright
and early tomorrow to help me fire Tad.
You can't fire him.
Yes, I can.
In fact, I can fire anyone I want.
And then right as I was
taking off her bra,
I woke up.
What do you think that means?
Seems pretty straightforward.
But I'm not a lesbian.
You're getting ahead of yourself.
Maybe this dream
isn't even about Robin.
Maybe it's about how
I've been so hurt by men
that women
are the only safe option left.
Why are you even thinking about
relationships at all, with men or women?
You're still fragile.
Now when you're stronger,
then we can talk about who
you might be attracted to.
But I'm not attracted to her.
That's what I'm saying.
Women my age
don't just wake up one day
with a whole new sexual identity.
This dream has got
to mean something else.
Well, what it tells me, clearly,
is that you are being
distracted from your recovery.
So what am I supposed
to do, stop dreaming?
But you might want to consider asking
Robin to find another place to stay.
This lettering is so small.
I can hardly read the label.
While you're deciding which one is
dolphin-safe, I'm gonna get some beer.
Do you shop here?
Where's Danny?
He said you guys were going camping.
I... It turned out
I couldn't go, so...
he just went... by himself.
You wanna get in line?
You wanna make me?
Spill it.
I'm sorry. He said he'd
call you when he got there.
You guys back already?
So where is he really?
Danny went to find Ana.
Don't freak out. It's a big city.
What if he goes
to the old neighborhood?
Patrick is not going to find him.
He found us the last time.
Come on. I gotta go pack.
You're in early.
I couldn't sleep so I thought I'd
review our liability
insurance, but...
I'm having
a little trouble focusing.
Maybe some coffee will perk you up.
About what happened
yesterday, Sam, that...
ugliness with Andrew...
Driven, successful people like
you have complicated lives,
but the specifics
are none of my business.
My...
relationship with Andrew is,
to say the least,
complicated.
I'm sure Andrew respects
and loves you very much. I...
just worry that...
What?
Well,
it's not unusual for children
in a family business
to have a sense of entitlement.
I hope you don't mind me saying that.
No. Go ahead.
This must be so hard.
What do you do in this situation?
Keep coddling him,
hoping he'll change,
or do you cut the apron strings
and trust that all the hard work
you've done
will allow him to thrive?
It's a good question.
You know what?
I've got everything under control here.
Why don't you go back to the house
and catch up on your sleep?
But there's so much work to be done.
Sure, but that's why you hired me,
isn't it, to help you out?
Thank you, Sam.
You're very kind.
And, Sam?
I'm very glad you're here.
Hey, Bert. I'm looking for Penny.
She didn't get off the bus.
That's 'cause she didn't get on.
I figured she went home sick.
What?
She didn't come home sick.
Where is she? Penny?
Penny said to give you this.
She's running away.
Any ideas why she ran away?
Problems at home?
No, everything's fine.
We did kind of forget her birthday.
And... she put the wrong
name on her birthday cake.
Honey, could we please stick to
the facts that pertain to the case?
How could you get
your daughter's name wrong?
Are you people
involved in narcotics?
No, I'm pregnant,
and it makes me very forgetful.
Surely you can understand that.
I'm not pregnant.
You're not gonna look
for our daughter, are you?
Aguilar.
Yeah, they're still here.
Your daughter's fine.
She tried to use your credit card
to check into a hotel.
You mind if I come in?
Marble bath,
flat screen,
$8 can of peanuts.
Nice.
Sweetie, I am so sorry
about the cake
and about forgetting your birthday.
I know you hate me right
now, and I don't blame you.
I don't hate you. I hate that.
Because you're not
gonna be the baby anymore.
Sweetie.
You're missing the big picture here.
Preston's gone. Porter's next.
When this girl comes along,
we are poised
to take control of the
house with a 3-2 majority.
Do you know what that means?
Women get veto power
over what tv shows to watch,
what takeout to get. Just think.
Think of a world
where the toilet seat is never up.
This is our time to take them down.
We're both gonna take them down!
I'm sorry I ran away.
We can go home now.
I have a better idea.
Since you already paid for the room,
how about we order
hot fudge sundaes...
and spend the night?
Just... just us girls.
You know, mom... If you have
two more girls, we'll take the lead.
Let's just... order our sundaes.
So there I was at this huge party,
flirting with this
middle eastern sheikh,
and out of nowhere... He offers me
a million dollars to sleep with him.
So what did you do?
I slapped him.
Apparently in the right place, cause
I walked out of there with 20 grand.
It's Juanita.
Excuse me, guys.
Gotta do the "mommie dearest" thing.
Hi, sweetie. How was school?
What?
You scored a goal in soccer?
What?
Hang on, sweetie, while I find
a quiet place so mommy can hear you.
Hang on, sweetie.
Okay, honey, mommy can...
Hold on, sweetie.
Do the words "wet paint"
mean nothing to you?
Juanita? Honey, I have
to call you back. I love you.
Sorry.
I didn't mean to. I...
Is this a...
A nursery? Yes.
We haven't told
very many people yet, but...
Lee and I are trying
to adopt a baby.
I had no idea.
It's something
we've wanted for years.
Why?
I mean, you guys have this
amazing life.
Parties every night, cosmos at 5:00.
You know all that goes away
when the baby comes.
And we can't wait.
Last month there was
this baby in Ohio.
We got the call
in the middle of the night.
We were on a plane in the morning.
We got to the hospital,
and there she was...
a little girl.
We held that baby in our arms...
for two days.
And then we went out to buy
a car seat to bring her home,
and when we got back
to the hospital, the...
social worker was waiting for us
outside the nursery.
The mother had changed her mind.
I know how that feels.
I am so sorry, Bob.
You may envy our life, Gaby, but...
it's nothing compared
to how we envy yours.
Hey, what are you doing?
The party's just getting started.
I know. It's just...
Juanita scored
her first goal in soccer,
and she wants to tell
me all about it, so...
Go.
Give them a kiss for me.
I will.
Knock, knock. Karen, are you home?
I'm in here.
Listen.
I've been thinking
about your wedding, and,
well, I just want
to talk to you about...
What's wrong?
Nothing.
The doctor found a spot on my lung.
A spot?
He thinks it might be cancer.
She told you, huh?
It's gonna be okay.
She's getting a biopsy next week.
She's gonna lick this thing.
Cancer picked a fight
with the wrong broad.
So given the diagnosis,
maybe it's not a good time
to get married.
We're getting married,
soon as we can.
But you said...
I know what I said.
All I could think about
was losing my independence,
losing my freedom, but...
after this happened,
now I realize the worst
thing I could lose is her.
So...
you're willing...
to give up salt?
I'm willing to give up anything.
Watch it, doll.
I told you I'm giving it up.
One kiss is all you get.
You're still up.
Yeah, I...
sort of needed to talk to you
about something.
Well, if it's me helping
with the bills... I've got great news.
You got the job?
You're looking
at the Downtown Grill's new hostess.
I start tomorrow.
Thank you for loaning me your top.
The manager said I looked very classy.
I can't tell you
how happy this makes me.
So...
you wanna tell me your thing?
No, it's... it can wait.
Are you sure?
Yeah. Absolutely.
I'll get you a glass.
Your blouse. I am so sorry.
It's okay.
Wait. What are you doing?
I'm just gonna rinse it out.
No... Stop. It's okay.
No, but it's gonna stain.
I'll send it to the dry cleaners.
But that is so expensive.
Here we go...
You have to leave.
What?
I need you to move out of my house.
Why?
It's... it's complicated.
Is this...
this what you wanted
to talk to me about?
Sorry if I did something wrong.
I have a friend I can go stay with,
so I'm just gonna go pack.
You haven't done anything wrong.
I like you very much.
In fact...
too much.
Lately, I've...
started to have feelings for you...
that I don't understand,
and it's confusing me.
You know what I'm saying?
I do...
I'm having those feelings
for you, too.
You're right.
I should go.
Seduction is an art.
Subtle methods of coercion are used
to sway the susceptible.
And those who are determined
will take their time
to get what they want.
And when the seduction
is successful,
those who succumbed
ask themselves...
was I seduced...
or was this what I wanted
all along?
Previously
on Desperate Housewives...
May I sit?
Not just yet. What is it you want?
I wanna learn the business from
the ground up, then help you expand it.
Bree...
Mr. Allen?
... hired a new employee.
Now you can sit.
You should be saying,
"Great, Ana. Go for it!"
Gaby thought
she had ended a romance.
Where's Danny?
New York.
Danny went to find Ana.
You have to leave.
Robin was asked to go,
but Katherine...
had a change of heart.
Preston Scavo was finally
coming home from Europe,
and his family was wondering
what kind of souvenirs
he'd be bringing them.
His brother wanted an
army knife from Switzerland.
His sister wanted some
wooden shoes from Holland.
His father wanted
some cheese from Bavaria.
And his mother?
All she wanted was to hold
her little boy in her arms...
Guess who's back!
But she'd soon discover
her little boy
wasn't so little anymore.
Let me at him! I get the first hug!
Mom, you're huge!
I know. Look at you.
You don't have to grow a mustache
to see how bad it would look.
What'd you bring me?
He just walked in.
Give him a chance to unpack
and give me my cheese.
Actually,
I do have a little surprise.
There's plenty of time for that.
You've been traveling all day.
You want to take a shower or a nap.
I kinda need to do this now.
You are really gonna
want to see the surprise.
I'm a little nervous.
Maybe I should explain.
You don't need to explain,
I'm sure we're gonna love it.
Everyone...
I'd like you to meet Irina.
I am finally to meet
the lovely Preston family.
Nice to meet you, Irina.
Preston didn't say
he was bringing a friend.
She's more than a friend, mom.
We're in love.
Yes,
Preston Scavo had
returned from his trip
with a beautiful souvenir,
And his mother would soon wish
he hadn't.

Sometimes you must wash away the mud
to reveal that sparkling
yellow underneath.
Sometimes you must
carry the flower into the sunlight
to appreciate
the redness of the rose.
Sometimes you have to
take off the wrapping to understand
just how green a bike can be.
And if you want to see
a woman's true colors,
just make her feel
unnecessary.
Ana, you're doing it again!
But you can't see my face.
This is a tool calendar.
It's gonna be hanging
in some fat mechanic's basement,
and he won't be
looking at your face.
I came to New York
to be a fashion model.
I came to make art films.
Isn't life funny?
I'm getting a doughnut. You have
two minutes for an attitude adjustment.
What are you doing here?
I've been looking everywhere for you.
You wasted your time. We broke up.
We were broken up by your aunt.
She doesn't care about your career.
All she's ever cared about
is keeping us apart...
And that's why she sent you here.
That's why the agency's only been
sending me out on these crappy jobs.
It all makes sense now.
We got a lot of catching up to do.
Can we go somewhere and talk?
Come on, January. Time is money.
I quit.
Gaby, you in here?
I need Ana's address in New York.
I'm on my way to the airport.
Why would you need that?
Because Danny ran off to find her.
I will save you the trip,
'cause if Danny finds Ana,
she'll send him packing.
She wants nothing to do with your son.
She'll tell you herself.
Hey, this is Ana. Leave a message.
And if you're my Aunt Gaby,
I know what you did.
Drop dead.
Hold that cab. I'm coming with you.
Aren't you a little
overdressed for bacon and eggs?
And buttered toast.
Buttered toast. If I'd known that,
I would have worn my formal boxers.
So... do you like it? I got the check
from the sale of the strip club
and I decided to treat myself.
Plus, I figured I needed something
to wear when we go to Chez Naomi.
Chez Naomi? Why don't we just
stay home and eat money?
Because you promised
to take me there to celebrate
paying your business loan off.
I'm sorry, but that loan
is years away from being paid off.
Not anymore.
I took care of it.
You did what?
With the check I got.
What the hell did you do that for?
What I think you meant to say was,
"Thanks, Susan.
You're the best wife ever."
That loan was my responsibility.
You were paying 9% interest.
You were never gonna pay that loan off.
I appreciate it.
But in the future,
just check with me first, okay?
I'm gonna take out the trash.
Now?
Lee's getting his mail.
He can't see my new dress in here.
Think about it. You already
specialize in comfort food...
Marry that
with a creole or cajun twist.
It's a no-brainer.
It's brilliant.
I love it.
You love what?
Sam just came up
with the idea for my next cookbook...
"Down home
cooking with Mrs. Van de Kamp."
Thank you, Sam.
"To my darling Sam... I couldn't
make it through the day without you."
What was that?
It's the dedication page
to your new cookbook, I'm guessing.
And I have your first recipe...
apple brownnose betty.
That's Sam's specialty.
Since when is hard work brownnosing?
That young man is the first one here
every morning and the last one to leave.
It takes a lot of time
to turn all that water into wine.
I am sorry you don't appreciate him.
I think he's tremendous.
In fact,
I have decided to give him a promotion.
A promotion to what?
Vice president.
Check my stationery.
I'm vice president.
A company can have more than one.
There's plenty of work to go around.
I don't believe this.
You barely know the guy.
I'm your son.
I know
you don't understand this now,
but I am doing
what I think is best for both of us.
Remember that sentence. You'll hearing
it the day I put you in a nursing home.
Did I wake you?
I just didn't get much sleep last night.
What's going on?
I was just on my way
to buy some overpriced shoes
to go with my overpriced dress.
You wanna come?
Thanks, but it's...
not a good time.
Is everything okay?
Yeah. Fine.
Gotta go.
Please don't shut me out, Katherine.
Now that you're home
from the hospital,
I want us to go back
to the way we used to be.
There was a time you and I
could tell each other anything.
Morning, hon.
I'll go make the coffee.
So...
Anything you wanna tell me?
Are you Rose De Luca?
Why?
I think you're my grandma.
Tyler?
So, after we get to Manhattan,
what's our plan?
We go to Ana's modeling agency.
I know that world.
It's all interconnected. Someone will
know someone who knows where they are.
How do you know that world?
Were you a model?
You didn't know? Big-time.
I was even on the cover of Vogue.
Really? What happened?
I decided I wanted a different
kind of life and married Carlos.
Good for you.
So...
What?
I shared something about my past,
and I know nothing about yours,
like where you grew up
or where you lived
before moving to Fairview.
My past isn't that interesting.
Come on. I shared stuff about me.
Telling me you were a supermodel
is not sharing. It's bragging.
It's not bragging when it's the truth.
And the fact is, I was very successful.
If you were, how come
I've never heard of you before?
Because you had to be
looking in a fashion magazine,
and I doubt you
were ever doing that.
Are we done sharing?
So, Paris, Prague, Madrid...
it sounds like you
guys saw everything.
But you still haven't
told us how you two met.
The first time I saw Irina
was on a beach in Nice.
It was...
How you say in english?
The...
Topless?
You real did see everything.
I was so embarrassed
to show my breasts in public.
Clearly, you've gotten over that.
Sweetie? Would you give me a hand?
Sure.
Are you finished?
Thanks, mom.
Why are you being so rude?
Because I love that boy
more than anything in the world,
and there is no way in hell
he could get a woman that hot,
so what does she want?
Fine. He's dating out of his league.
Remind me to high-five him later.
Now get back over there and be nice.
Here you go.
Thank you.
You have given me
so much beautiful food.
You're welcome.
And you have beautiful boots.
Preston buy these for me in Paris.
300 euros...
Almost $400 American, yes?
I remember sending you money
in Paris for an emergency.
I didn't realize
it involved footwear.
Fine. I'll pay you back
out of my college fund.
Your son is so generous.
He promised to take me
to the shopping spree
in real American mall.
I hear people pay $80 for T-shirt.
Here in America,
people are willing to pay a lot
for beautiful things.
I'm sorry. The water was running. Did
you just say Katherine is a leprechaun?
Lesbian. Katherine is a lesbian.
The first one made more sense.
Apparently, the other night,
Katherine and Robin
got a little drunk...
Hold it. Robin?
She's a leprechaun, too.
Katherine and Robin.
You could get the image out of your
head, or I won't tell you anything else.
This is too weird.
A lot of people discover
they're gay later in life.
How could she go from being with me
to being with women?
She was probably leaning
that way already.
She was lucky to have you.
You were a nice transition.
What?
You know,
when you make love,
you're so gentle and
you like to cuddle and...
So what are you saying,
that I make love like a woman?
No, I'm saying...
that you are a well-balanced man
who's in touch with
his feminine side.
I don't even have a feminine side.
It's what I love about you.
You cry at movies.
Movie. One movie... "Brian's song."
And "The notebook."
Tears of boredom.
I don't want to talk
about this anymore.
Why is daddy yelling?
He may have turned
a woman into a leprechaun.
You can complain about
Irina all you like.
I think she's nice.
Please. Your opinion of her was set
once you heard the word "Topless."
That reminds me. Did Preston
take any pictures on this trip?
Tom, I was there when
she unpacked her suitcase.
Preston buy me this.
Preston buy me that.
I am telling you, that woman is...
How do you say? A gold digger.
If you're right,
she'll move on soon enough.
I need to talk to you guys.
I know that look.
He's come to his senses.
I proposed to Irina,
and she said yes.
I don't know that look at all.
You proposed?
But you've only known
each other for a few months.
But she's the one. I know it.
Honey.
Wake up.
What's that mean?
Your mother's just concerned
that Irina might be with
you for the wrong reasons.
Like your college fund.
Why'd you tell her about that?
You must really think I'm an idiot.
I think you're young.
And I'm sorry.
Sometimes young is idiot-adjacent.
You don't approve?
Fine. I can live with that.
But I want Nana's ring.
You want to buy that woman boots,
I can't stop you,
but she is not getting
my grandmother's ring.
Nana promised I could have that ring
when I got married. You don't get a say.
You're making a mistake.
Maybe the mistake
I made was coming home.
God, your friend owns this place?
It's pretty swank.
Yeah, we used to call it
"The house that bulimia built."
I could have never been a model.
I like food too much.
Yeah, that's why.
Can somebody get me a coffee later?
Holy crap. Is that Heidi Klum?
Do you wanna meet her?
Get out.
Sure. She's an old friend.
Come on.
Hi. It's me, Gaby.
Gabrielle Marquez.
I remember you. It's hard to forget
someone who taped toilet paper
to the bottom of my Manolo Blahniks and
laughed when I walked down the runway.
That was quite
the practical joker back then.
Anyway, this is my friend,
Angie Bolen, from Fairview.
Practical joke, my ass. Because of you,
I didn't get to be on the cover
of "Sports illustrated." So screw you,
screw your friend and screw Fairview.
She seems nice.
Hello, gorgeous!
Hi. This is my neighbor Angie.
Nice cheekbones.
Now what the hell is up with that snotty
niece of yours? Don't get me wrong...
She's gifted and she's got the look...
but that attitude!
Tell me about it.
Do you have any idea where she is?
She's not in her apartment.
Your niece walked off a shoot.
Her boyfriend, Broody McFine Ass
showed up, told her
that he had relatives in town they could
stay with. Short story shorter...
I don't know where she went
and don't care.
You have relatives in New York?
Only one.
Who's there?
It's me, ma.
What?
I finally get to meet my grandson
for the first time,
and now you're telling me
that he has to go?
You know it is not safe here, ma.
Here's what I know...
Every night, for the past 18 years,
I was the only one at this table.
One plate, one cup,
one chair.
And then, someone knocks on my door,
and they sit right there.
And he calls me "Grandma."
I could have looked at him
till my eyes dried up.
And now you show up,
and you tell me it's not safe.
Why? The feds don't care about him.
It's not the feds I'm worried about.
So that's why you want
to take him away. Patrick Logan?
If my kid shows up,
he's a direct link to me.
That's how he'll find me.
That was 18 years ago.
Patrick Logan does not
care about you,
and he sure as hell
does not care about my grandson!
Ma, please.
I'll tell Danny you were here.
Robin the stripper?
You had sex
with Robin the stripper?
Holy Chaz Bono.
Was that the first time you ever...
Yes.
And Robin's at her cousin's wedding,
so I only have a couple of days
to figure this out.
Am I gay now?
Did you enjoy it?
I don't know. It was different.
I mean, we started kissing,
and then we...
No details necessary.
Katherine, you're not gay.
As much as you think you can switch
your entree from meat to fish,
it doesn't work that way.
This is not a choice.
But how could this have happened
if I'm not gay?
Look, I was with women
all through my 20s...
Any excuse to drag that out.
But it always felt weird.
Then when I slept with a man,
I knew that was it.
Then a thousand men later
he found me.
My point is,
if it didn't feel quite right to you,
chances are it's just a onetime thing.
Maybe you're right.
We were both pretty drunk.
If you're not sure, take sex out of it.
Get to know Robin.
It's a little late to start dating.
We already live together.
That is fast.
Maybe yo are a lesbian.
And in the short time he's been here,
Sam has proved himself invaluable.
So I would like you all to
give your support
to our new vice president.
Thank you.
This is a great company, but I think
we can make it even better.
Now I've got a lot of great...
Sorry. I was just,
showing my support.
Carry on.
Is that beer?
Just cause you can't have
a liquid lunch,
doesn't mean the rest of us
have to suffer.
It's okay. It's okay. I've got this.
Why don't we get you some coffee?
Why don't we not?
Besides,
I believe everybody
is waiting to hear
How you're gonna sprinkle
your magic fairy dust
and whip this company into shape.
Am I right?
You need to go now.
Get your hands off me!
Sam, are you okay?
I'm fine.
But if you don't mind, I think
I'll take the rest of the day off.
See? Told you he was a slacker.
Lynette, what can I do for you?
My son came home from Europe and
is engaged to a beautiful Russian girl.
Congratulations.
I hate her.
Anyway,
this is my grandmother's ring,
And Preston wants to give it to her.
She's very lucky.
She's not getting this...
Because you're gonna
find me a cheap copy.
I can try, but she's probably
gonna know the difference.
I'm counting on it.
Irina is quite the opportunist.
Five seconds after she gets it,
she'll have that piece
of glass appraised,
and when she finds out
my son has given her a... fake,
I'm betting that little Russian parasite
will be looking for a new host body.
But when your son finds out,
isn't he gonna be mad?
That's why I keep having kids, Jimmy,
To replace the ones who hate me.
MJ's asleep.
Are you coming to bed?
I miss you.
What, you...
need somebody to do your hair?
You know, us, sensitive men,
are good at that.
Please don't pout.
You are all man.
You're one of the strongest,
most macho men I know.
Now come upstairs.
I don't have to come upstairs
to show you that.
What are you doing?
I can show you
how macho I am right here.
Don't you think our bed
is a bit more comfortable?
Beds are for wimps.
That was MJ's lunch.
Now I'm getting rid of this T-shirt.
What is this made of?
Here. Let me take it off.
I'm ripping it.
You don't have anything to prove.
Where are the scissors?
I just wanna make little starter cut.
Are you okay?
Yeah. I'm fine. I like it rough.
I'm glad that you're having fun,
but my back is hurting,
so let me get on top.
I'm on top.
Serously, Mike!
I'm on a salt shaker.
Sweetie. Are you okay?
No, not really.
Honestly,
if I had known that you were gonna
get this upset about Katherine...
It's not about Katherine. It's you.
And it's not even really
about you. It's me.
Okay, just how hard
did you hit your head?
The loan.
Susan, you paid off my loan.
Well, isn't that a little...
1956 of you?
I grew up...
watching a man
who didn't provide for his family,
and I always swore
that was one thing I was gonna do.
I'll never be rich,
I'll never be famous,
But I can
be a guy
who takes care of his family.
In that case,
I will cancel the check tomorrow,
and you can pay
the loan off by yourself.
Thank you.
You know that 1956 thing?
It's kinda sexy.
Really?
Ana, this is my 17th message.
You might as well pick up the phone,
because I'm not leaving New York
until I see you.
Tell me.
What exactly are you planning to do?
Find Ana, cut the purse strings,
destroy her hopes and dreams
and catch a Broadway show.
Angie, you met Luke,
and of course you recognize
the beautiful Paulina Porizkova.
She and I go way back.
How have you been? Give me a hug.
Why?
What's wrong?
You treated me like dirt,
and now you want a hug?
What are you talking about?
You remember all the fun we had doing
that photo shoot on the beach in Brazil.
What I remember is getting you that job
when you were just starting out
and then freezing on the sand for
three hours while you bitched
because they couldn't find
the exact right shade of lipstick
that would make you look pretty.
I see you still haven't found it.
You know... I really don't think I need
to meet any more of your friends.
I'm gonna go call Nick.
Can you believe Paulina?
What was that about?
You're kidding, right?
Okay, maybe I threw
a little attitude once in a while.
You didn't throw it, honey.
You heaved it.
Come on. I was no worse
than a lot of other girls.
No, sweetie, you were
the Queen Bitch Diva...
Insulting photographers,
upsetting booking agents.
That's why your career
went down in flames.
No. My career ended
because I decided to marry Carlos.
You remember.
I called you the night he proposed.
And I told you to grab
that brass ring.
Because I knew it was over for you,
and you did, too,
or else you never would have left.
Excuse me?
I think I'm in the wrong place.
Does Sam Allen live here?
That one. But he's not here.
Then I guess I'll just,
leave these on his porch.
If you want the dogs to eat it.
Put it inside. It's unlocked.
What are you doing
with a picture of Rex?
I'm waiting.
He was my father.
What?
This is not how I wanted you
to find out. I am so sorry.
Bree, let me explain.
Irina really loved the ring, mom.
That's why she wanted to go
right to a jeweler, to get it sized.
Good.
I know I sprang this on you but,
once you get to know her,
you'll see what I see in her.
I am looking forward to when
we both see the same thing.
Hello, everyone.
You hungry? Mom made lentil soup.
I told her it was your favorite.
Your mother's full of thoughts.
In english, we say "thoughtful."
You're not wearing your ring.
Gee...
I hope there's not a problem.
I am all day thinking
about this ring.
I do not want it.
But... Preston said you loved it.
I do, but,
it is too precious.
This ring has been
in your family for generations,
and for you to give it to woman
you don't know, it feels wrong.
Save it for Penny.
What a classy thing to do.
Thank you, Irina.
You can buy me another ring.
You sure? Nana's ring is worth
a lot more than anything I can afford.
I know exactly how much it is worth.
But I want your mother to know
I am full of thougs, too.
So... let's eat.
Preston, get her a chair.
Here you go, honey.
Two visits in 18 years.
It's gettin' monotonous.
I need to tell you something...
About Patrick.
This again?
Fine.
What about the great
and powerful Patrick Logan?
First you have to promise
you won't ever tell Danny.
There you are!
I have nothing to say to you.
Wait...
Just give me five minutes.
If you don't like what I have to say,
then you can tell me to go to hell.
Two minutes.
I'll meet you inside.
Before you start, I know you sent me to
New York just to get me away from Danny.
True. I begged Luke to take you
and he did me a favor.
I knew it.
But it turns out
I was doing him a favor, too, because
he thinks you're really talented.
He said that?
He also thinks
you're a petulant, whiny,
spoiled brat, just like I was,
and that's gonna kill your career,
just like it killed mine.
I thought you were successful.
I was,
until everyone was tired
of putting up with my crap.
So I want you to go back to Luke,
apologize and start
acting like a professional.
Modeling can be a great ride,
and I don't want you to be
kicked off before it's over,
like I was.
Mom, I know you're here for me,
but I'm not goin'.
Grandma wants me to stay.
I don't.
What did you say to her?
She didn't have to say anything.
Your mother knows what's best.
But...
we have a relationship now.
We're gonna talk
to each other all the time.
Really?
I promise.
But as long as you're here,
neither one of us is safe.
Now go pack your stuff.
Do you, by any chance, know who
that woman is, talking to Rose?
That's her daughter Angie.
Really?
I haven't seen her around here.
Where is she visiting from?
Fairview.
He's still out there.
You really should talk to him.
I have nothing to say.
Bree, he's 26.
He was born before
you and Rex were married.
Fidelity is not the issue.
Rex had a secret life.
Fine. Be mad at Rex,
not at that young man.
He's innocent.
He showed up to work for me
and didn't tell me that he was
my dead husband's son.
What does he want?
There's only one way to find out.
You told me you wanted to explain.
You have two minutes.
My mother and father met at a bar.
He was single, so was she.
They had one night together
and then he went away.
When she found out
she was pregnant, she called him.
He had just met you
and said he was in love.
He offered to support her
financially, but my mom,
who was very proud,
turned him down.
But he did visit you.
A few times,
but my mom asked him to stop
because it was too hard on me.
And did you ever see him again?
Yes.
From right here.
I used to ride my bike over.
I'd watch you
and Andrew and Danielle.
I wanted to understand why my father
would choose all of you over me...
And I did.
You were all so perfect.
My mom died six months ago,
And that's when I decided
I needed to meet you.
Why didn't you tell me who you were?
Because I wanted you to like me...
And I wasn't sure you would.
You look cold.
Why don't you come into the house,
and I'll make you some hot chocolate,
and we can talk?
You know, not to
put any pressure on you, but,
I caught the bouquet.
Do we need to talk?
I mean, we haven't since...
it happened.
First of all,
you are a wonderful,
beautiful person.
Yowza.
I was drunk.
I didn't even know what I was doing
until I was doing it, And then...
The other night was a mistake,
And...
I'm so sorry.
That is...
complete crap.
What?
I'm not gonna let you blame
what happened on being drunk.
Okay, then.
You know
what I've been through recently.
And maybe I was...
trying to forget that with you?
But I am not attracted to women.
So no matter what it was,
it doesn't count.
I know how you touched me,
and I...
I saw the look in your eyes
when I touched you.
You may deny it now, but,
we connected...
and it counted.
It counted.
Thank you.
You want an extra pillow?
There's empty seats in the back.
I'm just gonna go sleep there.
You okay?
I'm just tired.
You may have picked up
on this trip that
I haven't always been a good person.
And I'm gonna work on that,
starting with you.
Did Danny say there were
seats in the back?
Come on. Come on.
I'm serious. I'm serious. Look,
I know you have a secret.
Carlos and I overheard
you and Nick fighting...
Something about blowing your cover.
Don't worry.
I didn't tell anybody. I just...
I just want you to know that...
I've carried around
a lot of secrets,
and I know how lonely it can feel.
So if you ever need a friend...
When I was 18,
I wanted to save the planet.
I organized protests against
logging companies, big oil,
auto plants.
But then I got involved
with a bad guy...
A really bad guy.
He convinced me
that we had to get more aggressive.
Long story short...
Someone got killed.
So... this bad guy...
You're not talking
about Nick, are you?
He's the one who helped me
run away from the psycho.
So who's the psycho?
Danny's father.
It's not always easy
to see someone's true colors.
Sometimes,
you must look beneath
the masculine veneer
to find that fragile ego.
You must ignore
the sparkle of the jewel
to know you're looking at a fake.
You must bring the truth
out of the shadows
to see the beauty of its smile.
Yes, people hide their
true nature from us,
every day,
And sadly,
we only find out
when it's too late.
It's Iris Beckley.
I live next to Rose De Luca.
You told me to give you a ring
if I ever saw Rose's daughter.
I'll tell you where she lives
when I get my $1,000.
Previously on
Desperate Housewives...
Preston buy this for me in Paris.
That woman is a gold digger.
There was a shocking announcement.
You proposed?
She's the one. I know it.
The other night was a mistake.
A surprising move.
A dangerous disclosure.
I'll tell you where she lives
when I get my 1,000$.
A stunning discovery.
What are you doing
with a picture of Rex?
He was my father.
And a welcoming embrace.
You should never trust
family photos.
They are designed to be misleading.
A mother's bright smile
may hide
a lifetime of disappointment.
A son's sweet expression
could conceal boundless rage.
A daughter's sedate pose
might obscure years
of un-lady like behavior.
And as for that father
with the air of dignity,
there's always the chance...
he has another family elsewhere.
I don't know what to say.
I'm not surprised.
It's a shocking bit of news,
to say the least.
So you're my brother?
Half-brother,
to be precise.
I can't believe this.
You have every right to be upset.
Your father should've told us about
this years ago.
But please don't be angry with Sam.
It's not his fault.
I'm fine. I just need
to be by myself for a while.
Of course. We understand.
If you don't mind,
I'll hug you later.
Take your time.
He certainly handled that
better than I expected.
When the shock wears off,
I think we'll end up good friends.
And wait till you meet Danielle.
Her flight comes in tomorrow,
and I just know the two of you
are really gonna hit it off.
Don't you agree, Orson?
Yes, I'm sure.
Sam, would you mind locking up
the test kitchen?
Happy to.
Again, thank you for everything.
When did you speak to Danielle?
An hour ago, and she was just
as stunned as Andrew,
but when I said I was
gonna have a little dinner for Sam,
she was determined to be here.
You've certainly wasted no time
welcoming Sam to the family.
Why not? That skeleton's been kept
in the closet long enough.
I understand.
And I agree that Andrew and Danielle
should try to make a connection to Sam.
He's their blood relative.
I'm just not sure why
you're so excited by it.
Excited?
I'm ashamed.
Ashamed?
Rex kept that boy
in the shadows for years.
I can't look at Sam without feeling
overwhelming guilt.
You have nothing to feel guilty for.
It doesn't matter.
Rex is gone, and someone
needs to make it up to him.
He is a Van De Kamp,
and I am gonna see to it
that he is treated like one.
Yes,
be careful
when looking at family photos...
Like certain members of the family,
they are not to be trusted.

Every year, Oakridge private school
held a fund-raising drive.
Students were asked to sell
$3 bars of chocolate.
Whoever sold the most
would receive a prize.
Of course, for someone to win,
someone else had to lose.
Hey MJ, have you gone in
and gotten your candy yet?
You better hurry up, 'cause I already
saw some kids selling candy outside.
It doesn't matter.
Why not?
'cause I'm not gonna win.
I never win anything.
You promised him he'd win?
He was about to cry.
What was I supposed to say?
How about, "If at first
you don't succeed, try, try again"?
He tries all the time.
He never wins anything.
He's horrible at sports.
He's lousy at card games.
Let us not forget his humiliation
at that spelling bee.
Why did he think
"Kayak" had a "Q" in it?
My point is that I want him
to feel good about himself.
Every child should win
something at least once.
See,
you win everything.
I know what it's like to lose.
Dear God,
not the jump rope competition.
It was sixth grade,
and there was a jump rope competition.
It was down to me
and Barbara Briscoe.
She had asthma,
and it was dandelion season,
and her eyes were swollen,
and she was jumping blind,
until...
her mom...
gave her an antihistamine shot...
which is technically a steroid...
and she was juiced!
So are you gonna be
supportive or not?
Yes, I will,
if you promise
to never tell that story again.
Was good?
If I had any government secrets,
they'd be yours.
Irina? I'm sorry.
I need to get the laundry.
Hold one second.
I am yet to get decent.
Come in.
Thanks.
I thought I made that bed
this morning.
I...
take nap.
Feel much better.
I'll bet you do.
I will see you downstairs.
Man, that was close!
Crap.
Your father and I
told you
no sleeping together in this house,
and here you are, openly defying us.
Not openly. We were hoping
to get away with it.
That is not funny.
Your 11-year-old sister
is in the next room.
I don't want you setting
that kind of example.
Dude, look out.
Mom's back from the store.
This is what I was looking for.
I better get dressed.
Preston, get back here!
I don't want
a repeat of this, Irina.
Do you understand?
Why don't you just speak truth?
If Preston was seeing another girl,
you would not much care.
You just don't like me.
That...
is not true.
I'm still getting to know you,
and I am sure that over time,
I will come to think of you
as a valued member of our...
Here's what I was looking for.
You were right.
That was more refreshing
than taking a nap.
I told you.
Honey?
Don't dress in front of the window.
I'm afraid of what your body
could to do Roy's heart.
Did you ever call him back?
Yeah, this morning.
Mrs. McCluskey had her surgery,
and apparently, she's cancer-free,
so Roy's throwing
a party to celebrate.
That's so sweet.
I hope you told him we'll be there.
Can we talk about that?
I told him we'd go,
but I don't think we should go...
together.
What do you mean?
Except for Susan,
people don't really know
what's going on.
You know what's funny?
Neither do I.
So... what is going on between us?
Are we friends with benefits?
Are we just dating? What?
Do we have to put a label on it?
I just want to know
how you're feeling.
I really like you.
That's how I feel.
Can't that be enough for now?
It could be,
but it could also
be pretty wonderful
to let people know
how happy we make each other.
I... don't know.
I was right about the nap.
Hello, ladies! Hide the booze.
We have a guest.
Hit it.
Hi. My name is Juanita Solis,
and I'm in the third grade.
You're losing 'em.
Get to the pitch.
"Won't you support me?
"I am selling candy
so I can stay in school
and not end up on the street
selling drugs."
I'll take it from here.
It's a fund-raiser.
3 bucks a bar.
Whip out your wallets.
I'd hate to see Juanita on crack,
so I'll buy one.
Me, too. Do you have caramel?
One lousy bar?
It's a contest.
Juanita plans to win.
Come on. Need I remind you
of all the crap I've bought
from your kids over the years?
And I do mean crap,
not like this quality processed sugar
I am peddling today.
MJ is playing in the other room.
Why don't you go join him?
Here's the thing...
before you got here,
Bree and Lynette agreed to buy
eight bars from MJ.
It's okay. They can buy
from Juanita, too.
It's a little more
complicated than that.
MJ is having a bit
of a self-esteem crisis lately,
and he feels like
he's on a losing streak,
so I really, really need
him to win this one.
You understand, right?
Of course.
Thank you.
I understand. I just don't care.
Excuse me?
Juanita's having a crisis of her own.
She's new to Oakridge, and she's
having trouble making new friends.
As you know, the winner gets a party,
and they can invite whoever they want,
which could go a long way
in helping her fit in.
You understand, right?
Sure. Of course.
It's just,
he's never won anything before.
She has no friends.
So... what are we doing?
It seems to me
if we buy the same amount
from both of you,
it'll just be a wash,
so we don't need to buy any at all.
Get out your wallet.
I was so shocked to hear
you had lung cancer.
I didn't even know you smoked.
I didn't. That's the thing.
People think you have to be a smoker
to get it, but you don't.
A girl your age was having
the same surgery I had,
never smoked a day in her life.
You could be that girl, Gaby.
Let's get a drink,
since we're dying anyway.
Remember...
We're not a couple.
I know. We're on a
covert lesbian mission.
I'm sorry. I just want people
not to figure out we're together.
It'll blow their minds.
Please.
You stabbed yourself and blamed Mike,
and this will blow their minds?
Hey, ladies.
Hi, Tom. Having fun?
Best cancer party ever.
I was talking to Karen's doctor.
You made quite the
impression on him.
Me?
He begged me to introduce you.
Do you mind?
Why would I?
We're only roommates.
And here's your change. Enjoy.
Willy Wonka!
Selling candy
at an "I survived cancer" Party?
Tacky.
Chocolate is filled
with antioxidants,
which, as we all know,
fight disease.
So you could say
that I just saved a life.
Yeah, right. The competition
is between the kids.
They're supposed to be doing
the selling, not the parents.
Speedo season is a month away,
and you have the nerve
to sell this to my husband?
... he was a doctor.
She was a surgeon.
I always knew I'd go to med school,
that incredible feeling
of helping people.
Plus, they give you that pad, and
you can write any prescription you want.
Beautiful and laughs at my jokes.
Two more cocktails,
and I may be proposing.
Sorry to interrupt.
Can I talk to you for a minute?
Will you excuse me, David?
... and she never smoked
a day in her life.
You could be that girl, Lee.
It's one thing to hide our relationship.
It's another to flirt right in my face.
I wasn't flirting.
He was flirting with me.
I saw your face.
You were enjoying it.
Listen up, everyone.
I just want to thank you all for coming
and to say to Karen,
thank God you're all right, baby.
Thanks, everybody.
And I also want to thank
the big guy upstairs.
Now if we could all take a moment
to remember the people who
weren't as lucky as I was.
Make up your mind, Katherine.
Are you gay or straight?
I don't know! Just because
I enjoy having sex with you
doesn't make me a lesbian!
Look at this.
I wonder what Rex would say
if he saw us here all together.
Probably,
"Who's the guy in the wheelchair?"
So, Sam, mom tells me
you got some fancy degree?
His MBA, which he earned
while working two jobs
and nursing his sick mother.
I just did what I had to do.
Don't be so modest. He also
spent a summer in Micronesia,
helping to dig wells.
It was challenging,
but I really wanted to work
with the poor.
Sounds like my first job.
You worked in the food court
at the mall.
The outlet mall.
Trust me. I know what it's like
to work with poor people.
They're always late.
Rex and I always hoped the
children would take an interest
in working
with those less fortunate...
We saw an opportunity to disappoint
them once again, and we grabbed it.
So...
My father was interested
in charity work.
What else?
So many things...
Travel, history, the arts.
He especially loved music.
Really? Me, too.
I play the guitar.
You do?
Stay right there.
That was lovely.
I'm really rusty.
Yeah, I could hear that.
This is pretty cool.
I'm actually playing
my dad's guitar.
It's just been sitting in
that closet for years, gathering dust.
In fact, why don't you keep it?
What?
What?
Why not? You should have something
to remember your father by.
Wait a minute.
What if I want it?
What if Danielle wants it?
I don't want it.
Don't you have a flight to catch?
You've never shown
any interest in that thing.
It's my dad's guitar.
I'm plenty interested.
But you don't even play.
I do so.
I took lessons.
By all means...
we'd love to hear.
Jingle bells
Jingle bell...
Jingle
all the...
way.
What fun...
What fun indeed.
Would you please
give Sam the guitar?
If Andrew wants it that badly...
He doesn't care about the guitar.
He's being unreasonable.
You're giving out my dad's stuff to
a total stranger and I'm unreasonable?
Sam is a member of this family.
Now give him the guitar.
I've got an idea.
Why don't we split it?
I must apologize.
My presence here is clearly causing
unhappiness. I think I should go.
No need to apologize. You have
behaved with the utmost dignity
in the face of unthinkable rudeness.
Thank you.
Yeah, I know.
He's the perfect son.
Problem is, he's not yours.
So... we talking yet?
What the hell?
I'm gettin bored of the silent treatment
so you might as well shoot me.
You had no right to tell her.
I know my mom. There was no other
way she was letting go of Danny.
So are we over this? Because if not,
I'd really prefer a bullet in my head.
It used to be just you,
me and Patrick knew.
Now your mom. What if he finds out?
She is not gonna tell him.
Ange, I love that boy.
I was the one in the delivery room.
I was the first one to hold him,
even before you.
I know.
I can't let him find out from
somebody else. I've gotta tell'im.
You are his father.
You gave up
your life to protect him.
You're the only father
he needs to know about.
Maybe you're right.
Please get this the hell out of here,
before someone gets hurt?
I didn't think you'd do it,
but I'm not stupid.
It's Patrick Logan.
Just got into town.
I was hoping to drop by,
you know, for the information?
How about tomorrow night?
See you then.
And I've got a case
of selective Alzheimer's,
so don't forget the cash.
It's Susan Bremer.
I know. It's been a long time,
not since graduation.
So, listen, do you remember the night
that you got caught streaking,
and I had to bail you out of jail,
and you said you owed me one?
Well, I hope you like chocolate.
Is that Mrs. Solis?
Tina, I'm gonna have
to call you back.
Is she selling candy?
Among other things.
I'm gonna lose
this contest, aren't I?
You're gonna win,
'cause mommy's done playing fair.
Irina and I were talking,
and we feel really bad about yesterday.
Look, we don't wanna come
down too hard on you guys.
We're just not comfortable having
a couple of unmarried kids
sleeping together in our house.
You understand.
That is why Preston
must tell you something now.
Irina and I have decided
to get our own apartment.
What?
That way it'll be our place,
and we can do whatever we want.
We're getting married
in six months anyway. Why not?
Why not?
Lynette, you wanna take this one?
I think it's a...
terrific idea.
They're not kids anymore.
They're old enough
to make this decision.
Thank you, Lynette. It's good
to know we have your support.
See you later.
Okay.
Have fun.
What are you doing?
We're supposed to pull 'em apart,
not push 'em together.
Do you remember that
apartment we moved into
when we were saving for this house?
That dump? Yeah.
It was the size of a closet.
Remember how we treated each other?
I remember a lot of
yelling and throwing stuff.
God, there were a few times
I was afraid that we were gonna...
Break up?
You are devious and evil,
and I have never been
more in love with you!
Susan Delfino, you are so busted!
Gaby, what are you doing here?
Alice Gibson told me
what you were up to,
but I couldn't believe
you would sink so low.
I don't know
what you're talking about.
Okay, folks. We're on a break.
Somebody's gotta take their meds.
No, not yet! Not yet!
Will you stop at nothing
to win this competition?
That's funny, coming from you.
Me? I have nothing to be ashamed of.
Well, let me jog your memory...
construction site, cold wind, no bra.
You saw that.
Yeah.
Did I not tell you
how important this was to MJ?
And I told you about Juanita. But
apparently, your son's problems are
more important than anybody else's.
That is not what I'm saying.
Whatever. We are done here.
And just so you know,
I am taking the gloves off.
Well, why not?
You've taken off everything else.
Candy for sale!
Help a young boy walk again.
I haven't seen you since
the party. How you doing?
Still humiliated. Thanks for asking.
Come on. It wasn't that bad.
My sex life was laid bare
for the entire neighborhood.
What could be worse?
Let's see. You could have thrown a party
to celebrate getting over cancer
and had a couple of lesbians
steal your thunder.
Sorry about that.
But it's not funny, knowing
everyone is out there judging me.
Let me ask you somethin'.
Do you really like this girl?
I don't know.
I think I might.
Then why do you give a damn
what anyone else thinks?
People just stopped seeing me
as the crazy lady on the street.
I'm not ready for them to start seeing
me as the middle-aged lesbian, okay?
Well, if you care that much
about what people think,
you've got two choices...
dump the girl or move someplace
where people don't gossip,
if such a place exists.
It's not much of a choice.
That's what I'm trying to tell you.
I get it.
Thank you.
Break it up.
This is how rumors get started.
What smells so good?
That's borscht.
Irina is making dinner.
You kids have been so busy looking for
your apartment, we've hardly seen you
the last couple of days.
You find something you like?
Put down a deposit
on a place yesterday.
Don't be freaked out about the size.
You two will have so much fun...
that you won't even notice
how small it is.
It's not small. Three
bedrooms and a balcony.
How are you going to afford a 3-bedroom
apartment while you're going to college?
You tell them. I serve borscht.
Tell us what?
Well, you're right.
We can't afford anything
nice on our budget so,
I'm gonna put off
college and get a job.
Say... something!
You sure you thought
this thing through?
Because, you know, you need to have
a college education to get a good job.
I already got a good job.
You did? Where?
The Meatpacking Plant. I'm a gutter.
A gutter?
I'm the guy who scoops out all...
Yeah, yeah! I know what it is.
Well, did you know I get paid
14 bucks an hour, plus benefits?
Seriously?
What, is it a union job?
Those jobs are hard to get.
You'll probably get
a discount on steaks, too.
Your son just announced
that he's giving up college
so he can be the guy
in charge of guts,
and all you can say is,
"Oh, boy. Free meat"?
This is good job.
The money is a lot. What is problem?
Maybe in Russia,
it's every mother's dream
for her son to see what the
inside of a cow looks like,
but not in my home!
Calm down.
You could be a doctor!
You could be a lawyer!
Why are you so intent
on throwing your life away?
He is going to support his wife.
That is what men do
for women they love.
He's not in love!
He's blinded by a piece
of self-serving euro trash
who would sell her own mother
for a pair of designer jeans!
Thanks.
What's with the bike?
Eddie thinks he can get me a couple
of shifts down at the coffee shop.
And since you guys are too
cheap to buy me a car...
Your first job.
Look at you.
What happened to my little boy?
I grew up.
That's kinda the way it works.
No, I know. I know. It's just...
You never think it's gonna go
as fast as it does.
You're so busy just getting through
the day. You don't realize they're...
starting to add up.
What's wrong?
What? What do you mean?
You got that look that says...
"I got somethin' to tell you
and it ain't gon' be pretty."
Yeah, well, you know me, right?
Of course I do.
You're my dad.
So what's up?
You're right. I am your dad.
Forget about it.
Work on your bike.
Congrats on the job.
Who is it?
Patrick Logan.
Hope you like roses.
I'm sorry I couldn't get
an address or anything.
You got me everything I needed.
Good.
So...
then I guess...
Of course.
I know you...
been looking for Angie
for a long time but,
there's not gonna be
any trouble, right?
Trouble?
Well, you're not gonna, like,
hurt her or anything?
She took something of mine.
I want it back.
It's just...
I like Rose,
and I don't ever want to hear that
something bad's happened to her kid.
You should get that money
to the bank.
This place doesn't seem
very safe to me.
What are you talking about?
Look at all those locks.
But what if someone
were to come up this fire escape?
That window's always locked.
You think that's gonna stop them?
What are you doing?!
They reach through,
unlock the window...
And now you're in trouble.
May I speak to you?
How will this conversation end?
With beef Stroganoff on my head?
I am sorry.
Please to forgive.
I want us to be friends.
Really?
Think how hard it is for Preston,
caught in the middle
between our fighting,
when he wants us
to love each other only.
Yes?
I don't want to put Preston
in the middle, but I am his mother,
and I will fight for his best
interests till the day I die.
You mean you will fight me.
You understand English just fine.
Now you should understand.
I told Preston I want to
move up wedding to next week,
and he said yes.
Next week? The wedding is not
for another six months.
We cannot wait that long.
It is too hard for Preston
to choose between
a mother and a girlfriend,
so once I am his wife,
choice will be much easier.
No, you can't do this.
You met each other six weeks ago.
Preston barely knows you.
But you do, yes?
You think you know all about me,
and in much less time than that.
There.
From one Mrs. Scavo to another.
I found some of your father's
old yearbooks up in the attic.
I thought you might enjoy
looking at them.
He played football?
Yes, and he was
student body president.
So what else
can you tell me about him?
Even my mom didn't
really know him that well.
He was...
incredibly smart,
funny...
and so graceful.
What's wrong?
I just never get to
talk about Rex anymore.
Since I remarried, it just
doesn't seem appropriate.
I hadn't realized...
how much I miss him.
You can talk to me about him
anytime you want.
You have his smile.
What are you doing out here?
Mostly kicking myself.
I can't believe
how I acted at dinner.
Well, it was a fraught situation.
There was bound
to be some sort of scene.
Look, I know he's my brother,
I know I should try
to like him, but...
there's something about
him I just don't trust.
I know what you mean.
You do?
He's trying awfully hard
to get close to Bree.
I, for one, would like to know why.
You think he has an agenda?
We all have agendas, Andrew.
Mine is to protect your mother.
And what do we really know
about Sam?
Just the stuff he tells us.
It seems a bit too good
to be true, doesn't it?
Maybe... my agenda should be
to find out everything I can.
Why shouldn't you?
He's your brother.
Quick question.
How is MJ Doing?
I'd like to see a little
more effort in math.
Not in class. I mean
the candy drive. Today's the last day.
Susan, you should be so proud.
He is a selling machine,
way out ahead of the whole school...
Except for Juanita Solis.
But don't worry.
She is just two bars ahead.
You better get him out there.
Gaby Solis told me
she's taking Juanita to sell
outside a weight loss clinic.
Can I go now? My mom wants
to pick me up a couple minutes early.
Does she?
Sure, sweetheart.
Why don't you just help Vanessa
put her brushes away first?
What is that?
Did someone bring a cell phone
into my classroom?
Is this your cell phone?
Come on now. It was in your bag.
Whose else could it be?
Yours. My mom gave it
to you for your birthday.
So are you saying that you stole it?
Now you're yelling at me. Someone just
bought herself three hours of detention.
Hi, Principal Hobson.
Everything okay?
Detention?
We only have a few hours left
to sell candy. Who gave her detention?
She did, huh?
Thanks for letting me know.
You must be getting thirsty,
walking around in this heat.
Doesn't a nice, big, ice-cold
cup of soda sound good?
I have something that belongs to you.
Check your cell phone.
He's supposed to be out selling.
He was.
Then you gave my daughter detention.
Bad move.
All right, what do you want?
Let her go, and I let him go.
I don't trust you.
I don't blame you.
Bring him here.
We'll make the exchange.
Fine. But I'm warning you,
if there is one chocolate bar
missing from that girl's box,
you'll answer to me.
Your mom will be here soon.
Don't worry.
You'll be out selling
your candy in no time.
I hope so.
I gotta win.
You know, Juanita, there are
other kids that want to win, too.
I know.
I just want my mom
to be proud of me.
Your mom is proud of you.
Sometimes I think she's embarrassed
because I don't have any friends.
Every day I come home, and she asks,
"Did you make any friends today?"
She just wants to make sure that
you're happy, sweetie. That's all.
I guess.
I just wish I could make friends
as easy as she does.
I try and I try, but I just can't.
We would have gotten here sooner,
but your son can't hold his soda.
Juanita, come on.
We got candy to sell.
Mom, we gotta go, too. Otherwise,
Juanita's gonna beat me.
Sweetie...
I know you want to win,
but let's talk about
what winning really means.
I've rehearsed this
speech a hundred times.
Well, I think I know how it ends.
I can't live my life with
everyone in the neighborhood
watching me
and judging me. I...
care too much
about what people think.
So you want me to leave?
But if you wouldn't mind...
I'd like to go with you.
Seriously?
I want to figure out
what we have here,
and once I know...
maybe I won't care
what anyone thinks.
You know what I think?
What?
I've always wanted to see Paris.
And the winner of this
year's candy drive is...
Juanita Solis!
We did it!
You did it.
Now go invite your
brand-new friends to your party.
Tell me. Was it close?
Really close
until the last day, when Juanita
sold 40 bars and MJ didn't sell any.
Really?
That's weird.
I'm sorry you didn't win.
That's okay.
I'm curious about something. How come
you didn't sell any candy yesterday?
My mom says it's a secret.
She says it's only a good deed
if we don't tell.
You should listen to your mother...
Because she is a winner,
just like you.
There are a lot of ways
to win in this world.
Some battles are won
with a hasty retreat.
Some victories are claimed...
by those willing to cheat.
Some opponents are defeated...
with nothing more than a smile.
Of course, for some,
it's not enough to win.
Someone else...
has got to lose.
Previously on Desperate Housewives
Gaby learned a secret
Lee and I are trying to adopt a baby.
Mike made a commitment
but I can be a guy who
takes care of his family.
Lynette was warned.
I told Preston I want to
move up wedding to next week,
Next week?
A killer put everyone on edge
Can't believe she is dead
I gotta go home, My
mom was so freaked out.
It could be minished, if
she wants me to be around
So you're my brother?
Half-brother, to be precise.
Suspicious was born
And what do we really know about Sam?
... should be to find
out everything I can.
Why shouldn't you? He's your brother.
And a very dangerous man
arrived on Wisteria lane.
Good
neighbors--
They loan you cups of sugar...
They tell you why
your car won't start...
They even help you find your lost pets.
Good neighbors also come over
At the slightest hint of trouble...
Whether you want 'em there or not.
...Being unreasonable! You know what?
I'm tired of fighting about this.
Okay, fine. Walk away.
It's what you always do.
Gaby, what are you doing?
I came to return this
magazine Lee lent me,
But you two were arguing, so...
So you decided it would
be fun to eavesdrop?
God, it's like you see into my soul,
And yet you don't judge. Thank you.
Oh, come on. Tell me what happened.
Our egg donor backed out.
Not again.
And the surrogate we hired will pull out
If the procedure isn't
done in the next month.
Well, can't you find another egg donor?
We could, if Lee wasn't so picky.
Why are you discussing this with her?
For God sakes, I was
eavesdropping. Catch up.
Okay, yeah, I'm picky.
We spent two years choosing a mattress.
I'm not just going to
get our child's d.N.A.
Out of the yellow pages.
If we lose the surrogate,
It could take months
to find another one.
Yeah, and then she'll drop
out for some ridiculous reason,
And I can't take any more of this!
You know, maybe we're not
supposed to be parents.
Don't talk like that!
Come on! Doesn't it seem like
The universe is trying to tell
us something? Why not take mine?
Take your what? My eggs.
I mean, I've got plenty,
And I hate to see you guys so unhappy.
So what the heck?
Good neighbors--they're
people who try to help others.
Bad neighbors are
people who make promises
They can't possibly keep.
The morning paper said
a young girl was missing.
It quoted her family,
Who said she had vanished
on her way to work.
It quoted her friends,
Who said she wasn't the
type to run away from home.
It quoted the police,
Who said they had very
little evidence to go on.
Sadly, people didn't pay much
attention to this bit of news.
No one thinks about evil
Until it shows up on their doorstep,
Which it soon would.
Oh, my God. Thief!
Hey! You!
Freeze! Whoa! Whoa!
Lady, put that thing down.
Oh, yeah? While I'm at it, why
don't I just hand you the keys?
Now hit the dirt! Relax.
I'm not stealing anything.
This is a repossession.
Do I look stupid to you? Fire! Fire!
What the hell are you doing?
People come quicker
when you yell "Fire."
Now I believe I told
you to hit the dirt!
Where's the fire?
Susan, you okay?
I'm fine. Just
call 9-1-1!
Hey, what's going on? This thief
is trying to steal your truck!
Hey. You're the guy who's four
months behind on his payments?
Yeah.
Stop, drop and roll!
Stop, drop and roll!
Whoblems?
I was hoping business would
pick up before anybody found out.
But I guess that's no longer an option.
Mike, we talked about this.
I told you, I am willing to help.
And I told you, I'm not
taking my wife's money.
Well, enough with the macho pride.
I make a steady paycheck,
And I have all that money
from selling Karl's strip club.
No. I'm definitely not taking
your ex-husband's money.
Are we done here? Sure.
As long as you can explain
How you're going to
run a plumbing business
Without a truck.
I don't know. I'll figure it out.
And for the cover of the book,
I see you in an evening gown,
Sitting on a bale of hay,
ringing a dinner bell.
I love it. Such a sense of whimsy.
Well, if it isn't the dynamic duo.
How did your meeting
with the publisher go?
Fantastic.
Bruce loved the idea of a
nouvelle Southern cookbook.
And your brother came up
With the marketing slogan
in the room. Tell him, Sam.
"Mrs. Van De Kamp
Introduces you to upscale
down-home cuisine."
Catchy. I-I guess you
know all about marketing,
Having an mba and all.
I guess so.
Except, of course, you
don't actually have an mba.
What are you talking about?
I made a few calls,
checked a few records.
Turns out the golden
child never got his degree.
Is this true?
Yes. I'm a few classes short.
Is one of them ethics?
Andrew, please.
I don't understand.
It was the final semester.
We were about two months in
When the doctor told me
my mother was terminal.
I left school and brought her home
So she didn't have to
die in the hospital.
If you like,
I can save you a phone call
And bring in her death certificate.
That's okay.
The university let me
graduate with my class.
I should finish my
coursework next month.
But I'm sorry, Bree.
I should not have misrepresented myself.
Everyone steps over
the line now and then.
Let's all make an effort not to,
Shall we?
This woman is incompetent.
Why you bring me here?
Hey, you're the one who had to
come to a Russian bridal shop.
It was mistake.
Well... Look at the fun you're having
Chewing people out
in your native tongue.
Hey.
Sorry for the way she's
been talking to you.
Don't worry. You're not losing a son.
You are gaining a pain in the ass.
Tell me about it.
My son is marrying a
woman he barely knows.
He's making the biggest
mistake of his life,
And I am powerless to stop him.
If you like,
Maybe I get a little
sloppy with the pushpins.
Aw, you're sweet.
Irina? It's your phone.
If it's Preston, tell
him I be home soon.
Okay, your highness.
Bride's phone.
Irina...
Okay. Slow down. I...
I don't speak Russian.
Irina, it's some Russian guy,
and he doesn't sound happy.
Alexei...
Who was that?
Wrong number.
Wrong number? He asked for you by name.
If I wanted you to know,
I would say it in English.
Missus?
I can say it in English.
Hey. Double cappuccino, extra hot.
Need anything else?
Inspiration.
Sorry. We just have muffins.
What are you working on?
A novel.
I know--another guy in a
coffee shop writing a novel.
Just what the world needs.
No, I think it's cool. Mind
if I ask what it's about?
You really wanna know?
I do.
It started out as a love story,
But it's getting kind of dark.
This guy meets this girl,
Takes her from nothing,
Gives her life meaning.
Basically creates her.
Okay.
Then one day,
She just disappears...
Vanishes...
With another man.
Sucks for the guy.
And she takes his baby.
Damn. Well, she sounds like a bitch.
Sure does.
Anyhow, I'm up to the point
Where the guy who's been
looking for her for a long time
Finally tracks her down.
And that's where I'm kind of stuck.
What does he do?
Well, I don't know all the details,
But you said it was dark, right?
Yeah.
Seems to me the guy would kill her.
Funny. That was exactly
my first instinct, too.
No.
No? You asked my permission to
be an egg donor, and I said "No."
Oh, I wasn't asking
you. I was telling you.
Sorry. You can't do
this without my approval.
Those eggs are half mine.
How so? I'm your husband.
I own 50% of whatever
comes out of that uterus.
Oh! So you think you own my body.
I pay for the clothes it wears,
The massages it receives
And the implants it
will one day require.
If I don't own it, I'm at
least a major stockholder.
Which means I can stop you
From handing out your
eggs like party favors
To every childless gay
couple that wanders by.
You cannot stop me. I can do
whatever I want with my eggs.
And I can do whatever I want
with the credit cards I pay for.
For example, I can cut them up.
I don't care about credit cards.
I am trying to do something Noble here.
I'm helping these
people become a family.
You've hidden the cards, haven't you?
Damn straight.
Okay, I am begging you,
As your husband,
Please don't do this.
It'll be too weird having
your d.N.A. Living next door.
I don't care. My mind is made up.
I am going to help
Bob and Lee have a baby
So they can experience
the same love and joy
That we occasionally
have with our children.
So the Russian salesgirl
translated for me,
And you'll never guess
what Irina said to the...
Angry guy on the phone.
Please don't make me guess.
She said, "Go ahead
and call the police."
You'll never find me."
And that's it?
How much more do you need?
She is a foreigner. She's
done something criminal.
Start your deportation now.
Ma'am, without proof
of criminal activity,
There's nothing I can do.
Can't you at least... Interrogate her?
Yes, and... If you wanna
slap her around a bit,
You'll get no complaints from me.
Look, Mrs. Scavo, we
are a government agency.
We can't investigate your
future daughter-in-law
Just because you don't think
she's good for your son.
Ah. It all makes sense now.
You're single, right?
Never had any kids?
Yeah. So?
You just don't get it.
Hi. Nice-looking family. Is
that your daughter-in-law?
Yeah.
You two get along?
Don't get me started.
Got a minute?
M.J., what are you
doin'? Clogging the sink.
What?
Daddy needs work.
Honey, that's sweet,
but daddy only gets paid
When other people
have plumbing problems.
So I should do this to
somebody else's sink?
No, honey.
That would be wrong.
Hi. I'm having a problem
with Mike and his male ego.
Long story short--
can I clog your drain?
So don't phone Mike until I get home.
Ugh. Okay, and when you
call him, sound desperate.
That way, he'll feel useful.
But don't call till Saturday.
He gets double time on weekends.
There's enough there for a tip,
But careful when you give it to him.
I don't want him thinking
anyone's doing him a favor.
Trust me, Bruce. After
they taste these recipes,
They will be onboard.
Just give me the chance to dazzle them.
Okay. Bye.
Problems?
Bruce got a little resistance
when he met with the sales team.
They fear Southern
cookbooks are a tad overdone.
So I suggested we have a little dinner
To let them sample the
recipes themselves. Excellent.
We have to really impress them.
Let's see if we can book
the private dining room
At the britannian hotel.
I'll take care of it.
But before I do, I have
something... Difficult to say.
Well, I hope it's not about
that silly mba business.
I think I know why Andrew
tried to discredit me yesterday.
He knew you had me auditing the books,
And he knew what I was gonna find.
What did you find?
Did you charge the donellys
for five cases of vodka?
Yeah. So?
According to our invoices,
Only four were delivered to their party.
And the rotary club luncheon was
charged for seven cases of wine,
And only six showed up. Why are
you even looking at this stuff?
And I seem to recall your
having a party that same weekend,
With lots of wine and lots of vodka.
Okay, yeah, I-I took some
leftover booze to my house
For a party. What's the big deal?
It wasn't leftover. You charged
the client for that liquor.
That's stealing. Is Sam the
one who told you about this?
We are not talking about Sam
right now. But we need to.
Can't you see the type of person he is?
Yes, he is the type of
person who leaves college
To care for his dying mother.
You are the type of person
who steals from clients.
Believe what you wanna believe,
But I'm not gonna listen to this.
Andrew.
Don't you walk away from me!
Can't you see how he's manipulating you?
How stupid can you be?
Apparently I'm stupid
enough to have trusted you.
Well, if I'm the problem,
why not just fire me?
I'm tempted. Don't push me.
Clear your things out
and turn in your keys.
Oh, hey, Tom.
Did Irina and Preston say when
they'd be back from the mall?
Stop!
Stop what?
Not you. I'm teaching Parker to drive.
Okay. I'm planning to steal
Irina's passport number.
Oh, God. What are you up to now?
I have a new best friend at immigration
Who's got a friend
at the Russian embassy
Who's agreed to initiate
a background search.
Lynette, this is getting out of hand.
That woman is hiding something,
and I am taking her down.
Da!
You buy me beautiful things,
and now I thank you. Ahh!
Come on.
We shouldn't be in here
with the door closed.
My mom gets a little freaked
out. Well, your mother is a prude.
That is what happens to
women when they grow old.
Now kiss me. Mmm.
Mmm! Oh, my God.
Who's that?
Your mom.
"Get home now.
"Trapped behind the closet door.
Preston and Irina
are about to--"
Pull over. I gotta get home fast.
I can go fast.
Seriously, Irina, my mom's in the house.
I know. Is what make it fun.
Honey maple short ribs
drizzled with manzanilla Sherry.
These are amazing.
Bruce's sales team will
be powerless to resist.
Well, you are really
focused on this dinner,
Which is amazing
considering what happened.
I mean... Firing your own son.
I've done worse things to Andrew.
We have a... Very
complicated relationship.
You'll see that the longer
you're at the company.
How? You fired him.
No, that's just our pattern.
He provokes me, and I push him away,
But we always come back together.
So... You're going to bring him back in?
Eventually.
But the stealing...
And the way he spoke to you, I...
Sam, he's my son.
Hey. Busy day, huh?
Yeah, busy week.
It's so funny.
I've had all this work
right here on the lane.
Well, that's good, right?
Especially since you
don't have your truck.
Uh-huh. Hey.
Guess what I found?
Oh! My earring.
Been looking all over for
that. Where'd you find it?
Gaby's bathtub drain.
Oh.
Ohh, of course.
Gaby and I went jogging, and, uh...
So my earring probably
got caught in--in her...
Sports bra, and when
she went to take a bath--
Hey, do you, uh, wanna have sex?
So Gaby's drain,
Angie's garbage disposal,
Lynette's
toilet--
I mean, the really dirty sex.
So now I have to return all that money.
No, you don't.
I...
Gave it to them.
You're saying everyone
on the street knows
I'm having financial trouble?
Well... I think they
already figured that out
When they saw your truck get repossessed
Out of our driveway.
This is humiliating, Susan.
I'm sorry, but it all
could've been prevented
If you'd just let me make a few
stupid payments on your truck.
I told you, I don't want your help.
This is my business, my problem.
You know, I don't
remember all those "Mys"
In our wedding vows.
It's supposed to be a partnership.
If you can't let me help you,
Maybe there's something
wrong with our marriage.
I'm not gonna listen to
this, all right? I'm tired.
I had a busy day wasting my time.
I'll sleep on the couch.
Danny?
You up there?
Hello?
Oh, jeez, Nick, you scared me.
Nothing. I just--
I just got home,
And I-I thought I heard a
noise. It--no, it's fine.
Just hurry home, okay?
To Gabrielle solis, the best neighbor
Two childless, upwardly mobile
gay guys could ever have. Mm.
Aw.
I got it. Hey!
No, no, no. That was purely ceremonial.
We don't want you drinking.
Why? Does it affect my fertility?
That, and you're kind of a sloppy drunk.
Fine. Let's talk babies.
So... What are you guys
hoping for--a boy or a girl?
I want a girl.
That way, we can put her
in baby beauty pageants.
Yeah, they're so cute in
their makeup and
rhinestone dresses. Right?
Really? You guys gonna do that?
Why not? Well, it's just I
kind of dabbled in that world,
And for me, it was a bit much.
Well, don't panic.
50% chance it's a boy.
Then it's makeup and
rhinestone vests. What?!
He's kidding.
Oh! He better be. There's
no way I'm allowing that.
Mm, now that I think about it,
I do hope we have a boy.
And why is that?
I already have two girls.
I'm so sick of buying dresses.
When he's old enough,
I'm gonna take him on the
biggest shopping spree ever.
Right.
I guess you can do that
when we come back to visit.
Visit? Where are you going? My
mother lives in upstate New York.
We thought we'd move closer to her
So the baby can be around family.
Really?
Is that a problem?
It just never occurred to me
That you guys would leave
and take my only son.
Gaby...
This child- it'll
have your genes,
But it won't be yours.
You get that, right?
Of course.
I mean, it's the only
way it can work, right?
Come on. You ready?
Okay, no peeking.
You gonna beat me again this time?
Hey, guys.
What?
Mommy, why do you look so sad?
Well, I was just thinking
about what it would be like
If I couldn't see your face every day...
And it made me sad.
What's going on?
Come out of the kitchen.
I want you to spend some
time with these people.
Mingle. Have a drink.
I don't drink, Bruce. I'm
an alcoholic. One drink.
I'm not asking you to
swing from the chandelier.
Why are you so nervous?
I really put my neck on the
line for this book, Bree.
No one likes the idea. No one.
Oh, I should've stopped
at just one drink.
Look, they are gonna love the food.
I hope so,
Because if they don't, I don't see
How you're going to publish
another book of any kind.
Here you are.
Just put 'em on a little
plate. Yeah, that'll be fine.
Hop to, people. This is a big one.
Something wrong? What's this?
It's the Sherry we drizzle on the ribs.
This isn't Sherry. This is vinegar.
Vinegar?
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
It's ruined.
They're all ruined. It's disgusting!
The floor's not looking so great either.
Stop! We can't serve this food.
We've already taken
out most of the plates.
Well, don't just stand
there. Go get them back.
How can it be vinegar?
We tested the recipe last
night, and it was perfect,
And then I locked the
Sherry in the liquor
cabinet. Who had access?
Did you give Andrew's keys to
anyone after you fired him?
He never returned his key.
Oh, Bree.
They won't give the plates back.
The publisher guy's
giving a little speech,
And then they're gonna
eat. No, no, no, no.
I am not gonna lose my
cookbook career over this.
God.
Hand me that torch.
We're serving cobbler
in the parking lot!
I just made you real hot chocolate.
Don't I get a smile?
My son tried to ruin my career tonight.
I don't think I'll ever smile again.
Honestly,
I don't think Andrew had
anything to do with it.
You don't?
Mnh. Look at the planning
that went into it.
The vinegar had to be
substituted for the Sherry
After you'd selected the bottle
But before you'd left for the event.
And the ingredient had to be
something you wouldn't sample.
Come on. Andrew's not clever
enough to pull that off.
He can't even steal a case of
wine without getting caught.
Well, then who do you think did it?
Well, it'd have to be
somebody pretty smart...
At least smart enough to get an mba.
Sam? That's ridiculous.
Why would he want to hurt me?
Who said he wanted to hurt you?
Andrew's the one taking this fall.
No, that's not possible.
What does he stand to gain?
Hmm. What a good question.
Enjoy your chocolate.
Every once in a while,
I catch Susan looking
at me this certain way.
You know, I'm putting on
my shirt or mowing the lawn.
I'll turn my head,
And I'll catch her with
this look in her eyes,
And I know she's thinking
that she's lucky to have me.
So how can I tell her I'm dead broke?
How can I say, "I can't take your money,
"Because it won't begin to cover
The debts I've been racking
up for the last year"?
She thinks it's a
couple of truck payments.
She's got no idea.
This would really hurt her.
If she found out I kept this from her,
I don't think I'd ever see
that look from her again...
And I can't let that happen.
Tell me how much you need.
Double capp, extra hot, right?
Wow. Good memory.
I haven't seen you for a while.
I thought maybe you left town.
Oh, I'm not leaving
till I finish my book.
Oh, right, yeah. How's that goin'?
Did the guy kill her?
I tried to write it that way.
He went over there. She was alone.
He had the chance.
And what happened?
Just seemed too easy.
So you stuck again?
No.
I've got a better idea.
If you think about it,
The worst part of what she
did was taking the kid, right?
So I figure
The best way for him to get revenge...
Is to take something from her.
But what could he take that's
gonna be as bad as what she did?
The kid.
He's gonna take the kid, right?
That's what I'm thinking.
He did.
I feel awful.
The more he thought about it,
he just couldn't let me do this.
And let's face it, he does have a say.
It's completely understandable,
Gaby. It was a lot to ask.
So where's Lee?
I wanna talk to him, too.
He left.
Left?
After Carlos came over,
Lee and I got into yet another fight,
And...
We broke up.
Are you kidding me?
Lee says he can't go through it again.
I'm determined to have a child,
So...
Is there anything I can do?
Oh, right.
Sorry.
It's okay, Gaby. Like I
said, it was a lot to ask.
My left shoe is missing. We'll find it.
I can't get married in
one shoe. Just get dressed.
The wedding starts in half an hour.
Hey, maybe he should wear sneakers.
It'd be wild, like
he's too cool to care.
Or I could- I just
help him keep looking.
There you go.
Lynette! Help me look
for Preston's shoe!
Lynette?
What are you doing?
I need your help. Preston
can't find his shoe.
I put it in the oven.
Why?
Because that woman at immigration
Never called me back,
And I am screwed.
Oh, honey. Come on.
Hiding a shoe isn't gonna
stop them from getting married.
I know. I just wanted a few more minutes
Before I had to tell my son
I'm not going to his wedding.
I will not be a hypocrite, Tom.
I know how you feel.
But if you think Irina's got power now,
Just you wait until you don't
show up to your son's wedding.
Oh, I wish...
I wish... I went to church more often.
I could really use a
favor from the man upstairs
Right about now.
Mrs. Scavo?
You're not gonna believe what I found.
I'll see you Sunday morning.
You look beautiful.
Mm. Thank you.
I am guessing this one's much nicer
Than your first wedding dress, you know,
When you got married in Russia to...
Alexei kosokov?
Here in America
We actually get divorced
before we get married again,
Otherwise you spend
your honeymoon in jail.
Alexei told me
If I marry him, he
will give me good life.
But he didn't.
He never worked.
He treat me badly.
Now he won't sign the divorce papers
Unless I give him money.
Okay.
That explains alexei.
What about...
The guy in Italy...
Who pressed charges after you
cleaned out his bank account?
That guy was a pig.
Believe me, I earned every Penny.
We have a term in America for
women who get paid for sex,
And it's not
"Daughter-in-law."
You know why it doesn't bother me
That you don't like me?
Can't wait.
Because it really doesn't matter.
All that matters
Is that one hour from now,
I will have a ring on this finger,
And I will be
The most important person in his life.
So give Preston your little file.
I will explain it all away,
And he will believe every word.
He always does.
Preston.
Mom, do you mind?
I need to talk to Irina.
Your father told me you
called off the wedding.
Obviously, I think you
are doing the right thing.
I know you hate me right now,
And I just want you to know
that I am okay with that.
I love you so much.
I would rather have you resent me
Or even cut me off completely
Than to allow you to make a mistake
That could ruin your life. So go ahead.
Hate me for as long as you want,
And when you are done,
I will be here waiting.
Try not to take too long,
'cause I miss you already.
Hey. Where you going?
Motel,
Till I get flight out
of this horrible place.
What? The scavos couldn't
even give you a lift?
That's harsh.
I want nothing from the scavos.
They're dead to me.
Lucky for you,
I am not a Scavo.
Sorry about the wedding.
It's Preston's loss, man.
I mean, he'll never get
someone as hot as you again.
I don't want to talk about it.
Sure. You know, I get that.
You know, if you wanna save money,
You could--you could
always skip the motel
And stay at my place.
I don't think so.
No, I promise,
no--no funny business.
I mean...
Unless you want some.
Yeah, I-I mean,
think of it as a--
As a transition relationship.
It'll help you get over Preston.
I-I have no problem
letting you use me--
Okay, enough.
I'm a little out of your
league, don't you think?
I mean, I didn't come to America
To end up with some
greasy-haired little boy.
What are you doing?!
Eddie?
We all know that evil exists.
The newspapers are filled with stories
About young girls who suddenly vanish.
But we don't pay attention
Because we're worried
about our marriages...
Concerned about our friendships...
Anxious about our employees.
Yes, we don't pay attention to evil
Because we think it will
never come to our house.
But it does.
Hey, Mrs. Scavo. I'm here
to pick up Porter for school.
And sometimes...
How you doin'?
Good.
We let it in.
Sync by YYeTs.net

But I guess we're sort of connected now.
You would've liked her.
And fear set in.
Whoever attacked Julie is still out there.
There is obviously a madman on the loose.
Hey!
The stage was set...
I'm a little out of your
league, don't you think?
For the killer...
What are you doing?
To strike again.
There is a house in the town of Fairview.
Inside this house lives a monster...
the kind who kills young women.
You may ask how such a monster came to be,
and that's a very good question, indeed.
I'm out of scotch.
I'll buy you some more while I'm out.
You got any in your room?
No. And stay out of there.
I know you've been stealing my booze.
Mom, stop being so
paranoid. I don't even drink.
Sure you don't.
I gotta help Mrs. Scavo fix her car.
You can wait a little while, right?
His name was Eddie.
Everyone thought he was harmless...
Until the day his mother
went into his room.
She was just looking
for a bottle of scotch...
But found the truth instead.
Soon everyone in town would be asking,
"how could such a monster come to be?"
Sadly, the answer...
would satisfy no one.
I met Eddie on a Monday.
He had just turned 4.
If you're smart, you'll
take up jogging now.
Don't wait till you're
my age. It's too late.
I can't do anything! At this
point, I'd settle for anything.
Do the dishes. Wipe down
the counter. You've given up!
I'm doing the best I can.
So what's going on in there?
You know what? I don't
need this crap. I am done!
Baby, I said I was sorry!
It's too late, Barbara.
I can't take it anymore.
But you can't just
walk out. We have a kid!
No, you have a kid. I never wanted him.
I never wanted any of this!
Excuse me! Is this your child?
What's it to you?
Well, I'm sure you don't want to be
talking like this in front of him.
I was just leaving.
Hank, don't do this!
Don't leave me here.
I don't want to be alone.
Eddie, come here.
Come here. I have to get ready for work.
Oh, it's you.
I just wanted to check in,
see how you guys are doing.
Also, I... I made you a little something.
You're kidding.
Well, it's nothing special,
just macaroni and cheese.
Come on. Let me heat this up for you.
I don't know.
And then we can talk.
And if you want to
complain about your husband,
I promise, I won't defend him.
Don't just stand there, then.
Come on in.
He's a handsome little boy.
Looks just like his father...
Which is a shame.
Maybe Hank will reconsider.
No. He's serious this time.
I'm all alone with a
4-year-old to raise.
Isn't there anybody who can help you?
Family, your mother?
Oh, my mother.
God forbid.
What about friends?
You know, I have a great group
of friends over on Wisteria Lane.
We've helped each other get
through all sorts of problems.
Yeah, I've never really been the
type of woman to have girlfriends.
And now I'm 35 years old with a kid.
I'm guessing I'm not really going
to be having any boyfriends either.
Oh, don't be ridiculous.
Women in your situation find love.
You just have to look for it.
I guess.
Well, I've gotta go.
Um, if you like, I can stop by next week.
Uh, no, you don't have
to do that. We'll be fine.
Uh, Eddie, say good-bye to Mary Alice.
Good-bye.
You take care, Eddie.
Oh, so cute.
He's gonna be a heartbreaker one day.
Just like his father.
Oh, hi, Eddie.
Remember me? I... I brought
you a little something.
I'm not supposed to open the door.
Well, tell your mom I'm
here, and she can open it.
She's not here.
Oh, well, tell your babysitter then.
Y... you do have a sitter, don't you?
Eddie, where exactly is your mother?
Oh, my gosh! What are you doing here?
Look, it's my friend, Mary Alice.
Well, nice to meet you, Mary.
The name's Ron. Can I buy you a drink?
Thanks, but I'm not
gonna be here that long.
Get up. You're leaving.
Whoa!
She can't leave yet. No, this
party's just getting started.
Did you say your name was Ron?
Yeah.
Shut up, Ron. I have Eddie in my car.
Eddie? Has something
happened? He's not hurt, is he?
No, he's fine, no thanks to you.
Who's Eddie?
Her 4-year-old child
who she left at her home,
unattended.
You got a kid?
You know, you might want
to lead with that next time,
before I spring for the screwdrivers.
Oh, baby.
Don't, uh, don't you want
to get my phone number?
Now look at what you've done.
I am this close to
calling social services.
You might wanna change
your tone. Let's go.
You've got a little boy to look after.
I know I should have stayed home.
But I was already dressed
when the sitter canceled,
and I really just needed a
couple of hours to myself.
He's 4 years old, Barbara.
What if he had gotten sick?
What if he had hurt himself?
I know. I know. It was really stupid.
You've got to promise me you will
never do something like this again.
Never again. I swear.
It's just...
What?
I really need a man.
Oh, my heavens. I should
have been home hours ago.
Don't worry about us. We are good now.
I want you to be happy, Barbara. I do.
It's just...
being a mother means.
Always putting his needs ahead of yours.
You're right.
That's exactly what it means.
Baby...
Come here.
Oh, Eddie.
It's not your fault you ruined my life.
Gabrielle met Eddie on a Tuesday,
the day she moved into the neighborhood.
Carlos, I'm bored.
No, I can't go get my nails done,
because I'm waiting
for the freaking movers!
Besides, I doubt this town even has a spa.
It does, however, have annoying people.
Who come to your house
with welcome baskets.
And say things like, "hot enough for you?"
No, no, no, no! You are not
going into another meeting!
You know, just because I moved here
for your job, doesn't mean you...
Oh, yeah. Damn right we're
gonna talk about this tonight,
and it will be hot enough for you.
Looks like it's just you and me, Chanel.
Oh! God. Who the hell are you?
Eddie.
How did you get in here?
Through the window. How did you get in?
With my key. I own this place.
Well, I've been playing here
since the other people moved.
Can I still do that?
No! Get out. Go. Go home.
Shoo! Shoo, shoo, shoo!
Did you know you're really beautiful?
Okay, maybe I was a little rude earlier.
What's your story? What do you do?
I'm a kid.
Oh. Right. So why aren't you in school?
It's summer.
Oh. Right. Well, I don't
really do the kid thing.
So where do you live?
A couple of streets over.
The house with the weeds.
Well, that's the moving van that
has a lot of boxes I have to unpack.
You better hit the road.
Or I could stay here and help you unpack.
Follow me.
Mm! Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa. You missed a spot.
Oh, sorry.
Don't apologize. You do good work.
Maybe next time you'll be
ready to do a French tip.
Should I get that?
No. Shh. Keep your voice down.
It might be one of those Stepford wives.
With another "welcome to
the neighborhood" cake.
I mean, really, does
it look like I eat cake?
Some of the neighbors are nice.
That lady with the red hair
makes her own Halloween candy.
You mean the one whose
parents named her after cheese?
No, thank you. I like my
robots a little more lifelike.
Though she's not as bad as that blonde
chick who's always yelling at her kids.
There are people on fire who
are not as loud as she is.
And then I thought, maybe for a second,
that Susan Mayer lady and I could friends.
And then she started talking.
Okay, good. I think they're gone.
Can we watch our shows now?
Just as soon as you finish
unpacking those boxes in the kitchen.
I did it this morning.
Oh, my God. If you can sew, I
am locking you in my basement,
and you are staying here forever.
Cool!
Eddie, I was kidding.
You've been coming here
every day for a week.
Doesn't your mother mind?
No.
Are you sure? Maybe I should call her.
No. Uh, she has this new boyfriend,
and they like their alone time.
Okay. Well, then why don't
you stay for dinner? I'll cook.
Great!
Although, you are the one who
unpacked the pots and pans,
so I'd hate to mess up your system.
I'll cook. I can heat up soup.
More than I can do.
Okay, Yao Lin, how sick are you, really?
If you can dial a phone, you can come in.
And do three loads of
laundry and wash some dishes.
W... Yao Lin, you know I can't understand
when you speak in your native gibberish!
Hello?
Hello?
Surprise, babe.
Honey! What are you doing home?
Well, I was at work and
I started thinking about.
My lonely...
beautiful wife.
And that big beautiful bathtub upstairs.
We haven't christened yet.
You pig.
So you're saying you don't
want to take a bath with me?
Well, I guess the pans can wait.
Until Yao Lin recovers
from her double pneumonia.
All right.
We've done the tub.
Maybe we should christen
the guest room next.
Mm, that sounds great,
but I need to get going.
Wait a minute. You're going
back to work? This is a nooner?
I can't take the whole day off.
I already canceled two
meetings and a lunch for this.
So how long do we have?
Five more minutes.
Well, don't just sit
there. Fondle something.
What the hell? Who are you?
Eddie!
You know this kid?
He lives in the neighborhood.
I knocked. No one answered.
So I came through the window.
We're naked. Get out!
She told me I could come
over. Who's this guy?
He's my husband, Eddie! Get out!
This is how you've
been spending your days?
He's lonely. I'm lonely.
There are plenty of women on this
street that you can be friends with.
Well, they're all so weird.
Gaby, your best friend is a
9-year-old boy. That's weird.
He has no one in his life.
His mother totally ignores him.
I'm thinking of going over
there and saying something.
No. Stay out of it. This
is where we live now,
and I don't want us to be
known as the nosy neighbors.
But he's so sad.
I don't care.
Cut him loose and get out there and
start making a life for yourself.
Eddie!
Buddy?
Look, Eddie, I'm sorry
Carlos yelled at you.
It's just... we were cleaning the tub.
I know what sex is. I'm not stupid.
No, you're not, which
is why you should know.
You can't just break into people's houses.
It was okay when I was
unpacking your boxes.
Look, Eddie, I really like you.
But the thing is, we can't
hang out so much anymore.
I need to make friends my age,
and you need to make friends your age.
You know what? You're not so pretty.
Bree hired Eddie to
help out on a Wednesday,
and she helped him in return.
It's looking wonderful, Eddie.
Same time tomorrow?
Sure, Mrs. Hodge.
I think you gave me too much.
Call it a bonus for a job well done.
You don't need to do this.
Well, I'm sure you could
use a little extra cash.
Do you have a girlfriend?
Maybe you could, uh,
buy her something nice.
Uh, I don't have a girlfriend.
Well...
you're still young.
Well, it wouldn't matter how old I am.
Girls never notice me.
Well, did it ever occur to you.
That they might be waiting
for you to notice them?
Um... no.
Are there any girls that you like?
There is this one girl at school.
Do you ever talk to her?
See? She has probably
noticed you lots of times.
And wonders why you don't
walk up to introduce yourself.
I wouldn't even know what to say.
Does she have nice eyes?
She has nice everything.
Well, you can start
by mentioning her eyes.
Trust me. You can never go
wrong with a genuine compliment.
This is good stuff.
Anything else?
Well, once you have her
attention, you've gotta woo her.
Woo?
Yes. Give her a little gift.
So she knows that you're
thinking about her.
Flowers are nice.
Roses are even better.
And then eventually, you can
work your way up to jewelry.
I can't afford all that.
Now you can.
Excuse me.
Um, are you Eddie Orlofsky's mother?
Who's asking?
Bree Hodge.
Your son has been doing some
painting for me over on Wisteria Lane.
You're not the woman who has
sex with her gardeners, are you?
Oh, good heavens, no. That's...
somebody else.
Um, may I please speak to Eddie?
Uh, he's not here.
Oh. Uh, well, then, um,
maybe you can help me.
A few weeks ago, I gave Eddie some
advice on how to talk to girls.
Oh, I'm glad someone
did. The kid is a lummox.
Uh, yes. Uh, well...
What I didn't realize is that
the object of his affection.
Is my daughter Danielle.
He gave her roses and then more roses,
and then I found this in my mailbox.
Oh, big spender. Just like his dad.
It was a lovely gesture.
Sadly, Danielle doesn't
return his feelings.
She spends most of her time
with the other cheerleaders...
Say no more. She's out of his league.
No. That's not what I mean.
So what, you want me to talk to him?
Uh, yes.
Uh, if you could just say
something to let him down easy.
You got it.
What's going on?
This lady says you've
been stalking her daughter.
I didn't say that.
You just said he is
harassing some girl he has no chance with.
What the hell else do you call that?
I was trying to woo her.
Woo her?
Oh, my God. That's hysterical.
There's no need to mock him.
Oh, who is mocking? I am thrilled.
I always figured the only
girl he'd end up with.
Would be blind, deaf or inflatable.
But now that I know how
good he is at wooing...
Please don't laugh at me.
I'll do what I want, Romeo.
And don't worry.
I'll make sure he stops
hassling your daughter.
I'm sorry.
Hello, Eddie.
It's been a few days.
I wasn't, uh, sure if
I'd be seeing you again.
I didn't wanna come back,
but I needed the money.
No, I don't blame you for being angry.
I don't want to talk about this.
Oh, Eddie, I wish you had told me.
That Danielle was the girl
you were interested in.
Oh, yeah, right. Then...
then you could have told me.
That she was out of my league
and saved my mom the trouble.
I wouldn't have said that,
and I definitely wouldn't
have laughed at you.
Why not? It's... it's pretty funny.
Nerdy freak wants to
date popular cheerleader?
The only thing I see when I
look at you is a nice young man.
Who isn't treated as well as he should be.
Yeah, well, tell Danielle she can relax.
I, uh, I won't be talking to
her anymore. I've been forbidden.
Oh, Eddie, Danielle would be
happy to talk to you, as a friend.
I don't want a friend. I
want someone to love me.
Well, of course you do.
I think I, uh, I wanna work now.
Eddie, there is someone out there for you.
You just have to be patient.
For how long?
I feel like I'm waiting.
For someone who's never gonna show up.
There are girls out there
who will say "yes" to you.
You just have to find them.
Yes. It's half up front and half after.
So where do we go?
Down there.
Don't worry, cutie.
No one's gonna see us.
You can do whatever you want.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
I forgot something.
I got you these.
Wow. I just...
Please don't laugh at me.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Let's just go.
Susan first noticed Eddie.
As the boy who sold her coffee.
Then one Thursday, she
noticed something more.
Wow. That's amazing.
Oh, hey.
I didn't know you were an artist.
Oh, I was just... I'm fooling around.
Uh, what can I get you?
No, let me see it.
Wow. Look at the
shadowing and the blending.
It's... it's really good.
My mom thinks I'm wasting my time.
She says there's lots of
people way better than me.
Well, you tell your mom.
That I have an expensive,
worthless art degree.
That says I know what I'm taking about,
and you have huge potential.
You think?
Yeah. You just need to work on your technique.
I could help if you want.
Seriously?
That'd be great. Thanks.
Okay, whatever you want... on the house.
I'll have a large, triple-shot latte.
That's funny. Your husband
was in here earlier,
and that's exactly what he ordered.
Actually, he's...
now my ex-husband.
Oh. I'm... I'm sorry. I didn't mean it.
No, no. It's fine. We've all moved on.
Mike's dating the woman that
lives across the street now,
and I'm, uh...
adding a double chocolate
brownie to my order.
We're all very happy.
Well, if it makes you feel any better,
I'm sure a lot of people
would like to date you.
You have huge potential, too.
Brownie.
Right.
Eddie, the detail is amazing.
Your use of perspective....
I can't believe you've come
so far in just a few weeks.
Well...
I had a really good teacher.
That's sweet.
But actually, I think
that you've outgrown me,
which is why I have a surprise for you.
What?
I signed you up.
For a 2-week seminar
at the art institute.
And before you say you can't afford it,
I already wrote the check.
This is, like, the nicest thing
anybody's ever done for me.
But I can't go.
Why not?
My mom would never let me.
I mean, she... she... she thinks
this whole art thing is stupid.
Eddie, you can't let her do this to you.
You have such a gift.
Listen to me.
When you love something that
much, you can't just let it go.
That kind of love is the one
thing that keeps us going,
whether it makes sense
to anyone else or not.
This is just about the only
thing that makes me happy.
Then to hell with the rest of the world.
Mrs. Mayer?
Are you there? It's me, Eddie.
Oh, come on in! I'll be right down.
Hey, those art classes were amazing!
The first three days, they had us
do nothing but portraits from memory.
And then they, uh, they brought us
down to the beach to do seascapes.
I've got so much to tell you!
Yeah. Me, too.
Why are you wearing that?
I'm getting married.
To who?
Mike.
Uh, but he divorced you.
He made you so unhappy.
He did.
Uh, but then this madman kidnapped M.J.,
and so I went after him,
and then Mike came after us,
and he saved us both.
So we fell back in love.
This doesn't make any sense.
It's so quick.
I know.
Oh, my God. Are those éclairs?
Yeah.
Oh, they look messy. Get them away.
So, yeah, it is quick.
I can't believe in two hours,
I'm gonna be marrying Mike.
And promising him I'll
be with him forever...
for the second time.
Oh, I have zero credibility.
Oh, look at me.
I don't know if I'm gonna
make it down the aisle.
Are they chocolate?
No, I don't wanna know.
Don't do it.
They just smell so good.
No, I mean the wedding.
If you're not sure, don't marry Mike.
Oh, no, Eddie, I've...
I booked the church,
I bought the dress. I
have to marry somebody.
You could marry me.
I have some money saved up.
Okay, you almost got me.
You are so sweet.
You saw that I was freaking out,
and you knew that I needed a good laugh.
I don't know what I'd do without you.
Hey, I have to finish getting ready.
Come to the church if you want.
Oh. What the hell?
I can always use my
bouquet to cover the stain.
By the power vested in me,
I now pronounce you husband and wife.
You may kiss your bride.
Julie!
Eddie.
I was just getting some coffee.
How sweet of you to visit.
Well, it's the first day.
That they allowed non-family members.
I still can't believe it happened.
I keep asking myself,
how can there be this
kind of evil in the world?
What kind of monster would do this to her?
It wasn't a monster.
No, monsters are big and strong.
This was done by some weak,
insignificant piece of garbage.
That doesn't even deserve
to be on this earth.
Anyone who could do this.
To someone as sweet as Julie and you...
He should just do everyone a favor.
And just...
kill himself.
Anyone that could do this...
is too cowardly for that.
You're right.
It was during a Friday
night game of charades.
That Lynette was clued in
to the truth of Eddie's life.
Th... three words.
Third word. Third word.
You. You. Oh, uh, pregnant.
Bloated. Swollen. Huge.
Lady, Tom. I'm a lady.
No talking.
Better than hitting.
"Du Barry was a lady."
"Three times a lady."
Uh, "Tramp and the Lady"?
No. No, "My Fair Lady"!
Yes. Yes!
"Tramp and the lady." Really?
Coming!
It's not easy when you're
swollen, bloated and huge.
Where's my kid?
Hey, Barbara. He's in here
with us. You want to come in?
No.
Eddie.
Get out here.
Mom, what are you doing here?
Why didn't you answer your phone?
Well, that was probably our fault.
Um, we were playing charades,
and you know how loud that can get. Yeah,
I guess my invitation
got lost in the mail.
You gotta come home.
It's not even 8:00, mom.
I don't care.
Mom, I'm having fun.
Well, you should have thought about that.
Before you hid my stuff.
I didn't hide it.
Everything okay?
It's nothing.
Yeah, he hides my booze.
And then acts all ashamed
when I call him on it.
I know you hid it, you
little bastard. Hey.
No, Mrs. Scavo, it's okay. It's okay.
Mom, come on. I'll walk you home.
I... I don't think you should
talk to your son that way.
What do you care?
Huh? What is he, your pet project?
You feed him a little dinner, Lynette,
and then you let him
play your stupid games.
So you can feel good about yourself?
Yeah.
I got your number.
I'm out of scotch.
I'll buy you some more while I'm out.
Got any in your room?
No. And stay out of there.
Hi, Mrs. Scavo. I'm here to fix your car.
You are so sweet to
remember this. Thank you.
So...
how are things at home?
Are the tools in the garage?
I should probably get started.
Yeah.
Okay.
Hey. We got any cake left?
I'm not sure.
You okay?
I don't know. I keep
thinking about last night.
Mm. Yeah, me, too.
And I'm just so...
livid.
Yeah. That Barbara is
an infuriating woman.
No. Tom, no. I am livid at us...
the way she talked to
Eddie, and we did nothing.
I know. But we can't force
her to be nice to her own kid.
That's what everybody always says.
But we all know the woman
is a drunken nightmare.
We complain about her,
we gossip about her,
and then we watch her
walk into that house,
where we know something bad is happening.
But we do nothing.
Well...
I'm tired of being one of
the people who does nothing.
Well, Eddie is an adult now.
And he can leave whenever he wants.
He's probably so damaged,
he doesn't know how to leave.
Where are you going with this?
Ma, I'm back from the store.
Ma?
What is that?
Your scrapbook.
I don't understand, Eddie.
There are all these
newspaper articles in here.
About girls in Fairview who have been...
strangled or murdered.
Why would you collect this stuff?
Don't just look down at your feet.
You gotta tell me the truth, okay?
Did you have anything to do with...
hurting those girls?
Oh, my God.
How could you do something
like this? Oh, God.
I didn't raise you to... to be like this.
Didn't you?
What is that supposed to
mean? This is my fault?
Look... you're upset.
Why don't you sit back down
and have something to drink?
You're gonna try to blame this on me.
No way.
Screw you.
What are you doing?
What do you think I'm doing,
you moron? I'm calling the police!
Don't do that. P... put that down.
I always said the worst
mistake I ever made in my life.
Was having you.
Hey, Eddie. Perfect timing.
Mrs. Scavo, what are you doing here?
Are you okay?
Oh, my gosh, you're trembling and...
Oh, yeah, I'm just...
I'm... I was on my way out.
Then I'll make this quick.
Tom and I have been talking, and...
We would like it if you
would move in with us.
I know it's a big change,
but you've gotta get out of here, Eddie.
This isn't a healthy situation.
Yeah.
I guess it could be better.
Oh, my God.
Is she passed out?
Yeah.
This is what I'm talking about.
This is why you need to get out of here.
I mean, look at her...
dead drunk.
Okay.
I'll come live with you.
Great. So just pack your
bags and come on over.
I hope you like meat loaf.
You want me to come in and help you,
or do you want me to come
back later to talk to her?
Believe me, Mrs. Scavo,
she wouldn't hear a word.
Okay.
There is a house in the town of Fairview.
Inside this house lives a monster...
The kind who kills women.
You may wonder how a
monster like that came to be.
The answer is simple...
monsters are created...
by other monsters.

Previously on desperate housewives
this thief was trying
to steal your truck!
You're the guy who's four months
behind on his payments? Yeah.
Mike reluctantly borrowed
money from Carlos.
Tell me how much you need.
Andrew did his homework.
I made a few calls.
Turns out the golden child
never got his degree. I left school
when the doctor told me
my mother was terminal.
I can save you a phone
call and bring in
her death certificate. That's okay.
The worst mistake I ever made
in my life was having you!
A killer...
Got an invitation.
We would like it if you
would move in with us. Okay.
And Angie revealed her past.
I got involved with
a really bad guy--
Danny's father.
Many years ago,
a terrorist fell in
love with a woman.
This woman believed
in the terrorist
and his cause...
Until an undercover
Agent showed up,
determined to stop them.
The terrorist wanted to attack
those he felt were
hurting the planet,
so he got the woman to
help him build a bomb.
But something went wrong,
and someone was
unexpectedly killed.
The terrorist didn't care.
He said it was unavoidable.
The woman wanted
to turn herself in,
but she was pregnant.
So the Agent convinced
her to run away with him,
and he'd raise the
child as his own.
So they escaped from the terrorist,
hoping and praying
he would never find them.
Unfortunately...
He did.
Hey. If it isn't double
cappuccino, extra hot.
You know me so well.
Just made chocolate scones.
Interested?
Ah, what the hell?
Might as well live dangerously.
So how's the novel comin'?
Almost done.
Endings are a bitch.
I really need to
surprise my audience.
Hey. I know you're my dad...
But you still gotta close
the door when you come in.
Oh, sorry. Mm-hmm.
No, I was just gonna, uh,
I was gonna ask you somethin'.
You want to join your old
man for a run tonight?
Uh, dad, you don't run. You jog.
And no.
Come on. I'll be going by the park.
It'll be real pretty.
I'm working Eddie's
shift tonight. Ah.
I'm gonna be here late.
But I am proud of you.
Keep it up. Yeah.
Thanks, coach. Mm-hmm.
See you at home.
That's your dad?
Yeah.
I should have introduced you.
You'd like him.
Yeah, I bet I would.
So he's a runner?
Every night, even when he's sick.
You can't stop him.
He's pretty inspiring.
Inspiring?
Don't guys your age
usually hate their dads?
We've had our issues.
But my dad's sacrificed
a lot for me.
I figure this is
how I pay him back.
You're right.
Payback's really important.
All right, back in a bit.
How long are you gonna be?
Just long enough to get
a little sweaty. Mwah.
You be careful. Yeah.
It took the terrorist 20 years
to find the people
who had betrayed him.
What the...
And his plan for revenge...
Was just getting started.

Our mothers tell us to
beware of mysterious men.
Don't talk to them in the park.
Don't take their candy.
Don't get into their cars.
And whatever you do...
Don't let them into the house.
But what do we do when mother
has already invited them in?
Oh, my gosh.
Eddie, what have you done?
I saw you were running
low on supplies,
so I went to the store for you.
Oh, you didn't need to do that.
Hey, you're cool
enough to take me in.
I gotta earn my keep somehow.
I bought fresh vegetables.
Okay, now you're just
trying to make me cry.
Is that the laundry? I'll get that.
Oh, that's okay. It's Porter's turn.
I can't, mom. I'm late.
You can spare five minutes
to put clothes in the dryer.
No, I can't. Jeremy and Dave are
waiting to take me to the mall.
You are not leaving wet
clothes in that washer.
Mom, chill. It's water.
Hey, don't talk to
your mother like that.
Okay, that's my ride. I gotta go.
Unh-unh. After the laundry.
What a bitch.
Hey!
Tell her you're sorry. Hey!
Get off me! Apologize!
Eddie, Eddie, Eddie!
He shouldn't talk to you like that!
Okay, okay!
I'm sure he's very sorry.
Stop! Stop it! Stop. Let him up.
You okay? I'm fine.
Go join your friends.
Go on.
I'm sorry.
I just can't watch
you be disrespected.
I'll take care of the laundry.
Hey, Carlos. Uh, here's the money--
for the church raffle!
Thanks, Mike!
Now sister Mary can finally
replace her wooden...
Gaby's home. Oh, God. Sorry.
I just wanted to bring you the
first payment for the loan.
And thanks again. You really
saved my ass. No problem.
And just so you know,
I'm making a lot of cutbacks
so I can pay you back quicker-
no vacations, basic cable.
I even convinced m.J.
That Mrs. McCluskey's house
is summer camp.
Look, don't go crazy.
Just pay it back when you can.
And let's make sure
Gaby doesn't find out.
So she can tell Susan? No problem.
I gotta get going. Bye. Hey,
and uh, give my best
to sister Carrie.
Mary. Mary!
I know, right?
It's the middle of the afternoon.
What are you doing?
Why don't you come
upstairs and find out?
No, thanks. I can't afford it.
What? Every time you
offer me afternoon sex,
it's because you want something,
and it is not afternoon sex.
All right, fine. Check this out.
Where were you even hiding this?
Oh. That is a ski chalet in Aspen.
It's for sale, and I want it.
Sorry, hon, not gonna happen.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
That was just my opening offer.
What if I see your afternoon sex
and raise you... honeymoon sex?
No. No, I can't. All of our cash
is tied up in a business deal.
What kind of business deal? Ah,
you don't want me to bore
you with the details.
Half that money is mine. Bore me.
This conversation is over.
Now if you're interested
in going upstairs
and making love to your
husband simply because you...
Okay.
Like it? I've been
practicing all day.
Susan, why is there a
big-ass piano in our house?
Actually, big-ass
stopped making pianos.
This is a Yamaha.
So I'm...
Curious...
How much did this thing cost?
It was free.
You remember dear, sweet,
98-year-old aunt Regina?
The one you called
"the crypt keeper"?
Mike, that was okay
when she was alive.
Now she's a dead lady
giving us really cool stuff,
so a little respect? Okay.
As long as it was free.
Yeah, um, but as far
as Gaby's concerned,
it cost 30 grand.
What? Why?
Well, I love Gaby, but for years,
she has been flaunting how
much they spend on her house
and her car and her jewelry.
And this is my turn to flaunt,
and I can't flaunt
with a free piano.
Don't stoop to her level.
You're better than that.
No, I'm really not.
Susan, I'm not kidding.
You're not telling Gaby
we paid for this piano.
Oh, Mike, please.
This is my chance.
My aunt had a stroke while driving!
When am I ever gonna
get that lucky again?
You're not gonna believe this.
They're out of cilantro.
How can a market be out
of cilantro? I don't know,
but I told that clerk she
should hang her head in shame.
As well you should.
So what else do we need?
Let's head over to
the kosher aisle.
I need a few items for the
Schwartzman Bar Mitzvah.
We need baking soda. I'll get it.
Oh. Sam?
Please. Not now. What the
hell are you even doing here?
I lost my job.
I had to work someplace.
You already, uh,
got the baking soda.
Boy, I would lose my head
if it wasn't screwed on.
Who's that woman?
Nobody. Someone I used to know.
Oh. Is everything all right?
I was... telling her that
it doesn't make sense
for a store this big to
run out of a major herb.
I think we should check
out Hudson's market.
That's downtown.
We need cilantro,
don't we? Come on.
Hey.
Hey. Oh, you brought me flowers.
Well, I wanted to get
you a t-shirt that said,
"I'm a moron who wears dark
clothes when I run at night,"
but the gift shop was out.
So who did this to you?
Did you see 'em?
No.
Damn. What kind of person hits
you and then just drives away?
Maybe the kind of person
who wanted to hit me.
Wait. You said you didn't see them.
I didn't, but, Ange,
I'm telling you,
this guy--he drives past me,
he turns around and
swerves right into me.
Oh, my God. Where's Danny?
He fell asleep in the waiting room.
We've been here all night.
Uh, you want me to get him?
No, no. Listen.
I need you guys to go home,
grab the I.D.S, some money,
whatever you can stuff
in a couple of bags.
But you're not exactly
travel-ready, Nick.
Oh, absolutely not.
The place we talked about,
near Carbondale.
Just for a few weeks.
No. Not without you.
No, I'll send Danny.
But you and me-
this is as far as we run.
What if it is Patrick?
What are we gonna do?
We've been asking that
question for 20 years.
I guess now we're gonna find out.
Can I talk to you a minute?
Sure.
It's about what
happened with Porter.
Are you mad? You're mad.
No, I'm not.
You want me to leave.
No. No, I just want to talk.
You looked like you
really wanted to hurt him,
and I kind of need to
know what that's about.
Your family doesn't seem to
care how much you help them.
You're a great mom,
and they just push you around.
It--it made me angry.
Yes, I saw that.
And sometimes my family
can be unappreciative.
But what happened today
can never happen again.
I know.
Listen, I grew up with
an alcoholic mother.
I know what it like to
be angry all the time.
But when I was your age,
I had to find a way...
To control myself.
How did you do that?
A lot of help.
One thing--I had a great
counselor at school,
and she taught me
that whenever I was
about to lose it,
that I should do this...
One.
Two.
Three.
That really works?
It really does.
It gives you a chance
to step back,
feel like you're in control.
You should try it next time.
You'll see.
Okay.
Mm.
I'm really sorry about what I did.
It's fine.
Just don't ever do it again.
But thank you for wanting to.
Oh, come on, Larry.You're my business
manager too.
I am not leaving this
office until you tell me
what Carlos is doing
with my ski house money.
Gaby, you're putting me in
an uncomfortable position.
You should talk to Carlos.
I did!
I offered to put myself in a
very uncomfortable position,
and he still said no.
I'm sorry, but Carlos
swore me to secrecy.
Please respect that.
You're right. I'm sorry.
No hard feelings.
Of course not.
Hey. What are you doing?
Hmm. I don't want to be a liar.
When I go home, and I'm in
tears and Carlos asks me why,
and I say you grabbed my ass,
I want to be telling the truth.
Well played.
Carlos gave $50,
000 to one of your neighbors.
What?! Who?!
A Mike Delfino. Apparently,
his business is in big trouble.
Oh, my God. Mike's wife is one
of my closest friends,
and she never said a word.
Poor thing.
Please don't tell
Carlos I told you.
Of course.
I should get going.
Do you have parking validation?
Oh, those are only for employees.
Okay, you could take mine.
Hotel, food, incidentals--
$300.
You can order pay per view.
I don't even care if you buy beer.
Just stay in your room
as much as you can, okay?
This is stupid. It's been 20 years.
Have you actually seen or heard
from this Patrick Logan guy?
Do you know for a fact
that he's even still alive?
Danny, I'm not gonna
debate this with you.
If he started this
group you guys were in,
then isn't he on the run, too?
He's got bigger problems
than getting revenge.
Just humor me, okay?
Because if I'm wrong,
all I am is wrong.
But if I'm not...
Please. Just humor me.
Check stand one is now open.
Hello.
Check stand one is now open,
taking all customers...
Hello.
Um, I saw you the other day,
talking to my friend Sam.
Oh, I'm--I'm Bree, by the way.
I know who you are.
Well, this is none of my business,
but I noticed that there was
some tension between you two.
You could say that.
Oh. Well, I hope
everything is okay.
What is it you want?
Well, I don't know.
There was just something so
odd about that... encounter.
I don't understand why he would
talk to a friend like that.
Maybe that's because
I'm not his friend.
I'm his mother.
My manager said I could
take a break early.
You've got five minutes.
Are you aware that Sam goes around
telling people that you're--
dead.
Yes, I heard.
Why would he do that?
He's a complicated boy.
Did Sam tell you
who his father was?
He told me about your
relationship with my... husband,
if that's what you're referring to.
Did he also mention the
letter that Rex sent to me?
What letter?
It was after you were married.
Rex had just started his practice,
and apparently,
the money was pouring in.
Rex wrote
and told me he could
give Sam a better life.
He then asked for
full-time custody.
I'm guessing he
never told you that.
Must have slipped his mind.
I politely declined his offer.
And did Sam... know about this?
Not until a few months ago,
when he found the letter.
And when he realized that he
could have lived all those years
with his dad in a fancy house...
He... was beyond livid.
Even so, how could he go around
pretending that you're dead?
Like I said...
He's a complicated boy.
Gaby, hi.
Hi, Susan.
I just got back
from the supermarket
and realized I bought way too much.
I'm afraid some of
it's gonna go bad,
and so I thought,
who could I give this to?
And I randomly thought of you.
You're afraid that canned peaches
and condensed milk
are going to go bad?
Well, it's just,
my cupboards are cluttered,
and you'd be doing me a huge favor.
Okay.
Thanks.
Oh. Hey.
As long as you're here,
I want to show you something.
Wow.
We just got it.
M.J. Is gonna take lessons.
You sure you don't
want to start him off
with, say, a used upright?
No way.
Me wan-NY, me like-y, me get-Ty.
May I ask how much this cost-y?
Well, Mike doesn't like me
throwing around numbers,
but let's just say
your jaw would drop...
30,000 times.
Wha--
that's one.
This is none of my business,
but is this really the best time
to buy something this expensive?
I mean, didn't Mike just
have his truck repossessed?
Things finally turned around.
He got a big cash infusion.
You don't say.
Anyway, I know you guys
don't have a piano,
so if you ever want the
girls to take lessons...
Well, thank you. I gotta go.
Enjoy your peaches.
You owe me $50,000.
What? For your information,
Mike's "big cash infusion"
cost me my ski house.
What are you talking about?
Oh, don't play dumb.
Carlos loaned Mike the 50 grand,
and you know it!
Why are you looking
like you don't know it?
He told me...
Business picked up.
Well, he lied,
just like Carlos lied to me
about where our money went,
which you went and
spent on a piano.
Oh, no--no, I didn't. Uh...
I inherited it.
I was trying to make you jealous.
Oh, honey,
given different circumstances,
that so would have worked.
This is unbelievable.
I have the money
from the strip club
sitting in the bank,
and Mike would rather
borrow it from you guys?
I'm about to screech at my husband.
You might want to stand back.
No, no, no, no, no.
I have a better idea.
There you are.
Hey.
Hey, Mr. Scavo. How was the flight?
Horrible. It was delayed,
there was turbulence,
they ran out of food,
and I'm not seeing a plate
covered with tinfoil here.
There was one, but one of our 50
children must have inhaled it.
Damn it!
Okay, calm down.
Lynette, no. I'm hungry.
You know, when you were working,
I always had food waiting for you.
Oh, that's right.
You were very considerate
in your eighth month.
I'm sorry. I keep forgetting,
you're the only person who's
ever been pregnant before.
Relax. Relax.
We'll just order a pizza.
And wait an hour? Forget it.
I'll fend for myself.
Six, seven,
eight, nine...
Hey, it's okay. I'm fine.
There's nothing in here.
Come on. Lynette, you didn't go
to the store today? 16... 17...
Sweetie, you might want
to take it down a notch.
I have been in three
cities in two days.
You'd think you'd find the time
to go to the market. 21, 22...
What the hell is he doing?
Eddie, it's okay.
23, 24, 25... tell him
to stick a sock in it.
26, 27...
Okay, you need to kiss me.
Here. Mmm!
Okay, there. We're good.
We're good. He loves me.
He loves me.
We'll talk about it later.
So Eddie attacked our son?
Okay, I'd use "attack,
" but with a small "a."
Okay, that's it. I want him out,
and that's with a big "o."
Look, Eddie is not some
exchange student from France.
He comes from an abusive home.
We have to accept he
has some... baggage.
So I have to wonder
if he's gonna punch me
any time I raise my voice to you?
I am not sending him back to
live with that woman, Tom.
How about therapy? That might help.
Now we're gonna pay
for his therapy?
Okay, here's a thought.
How about we all stop yelling at me?
What a concept-
be nice to Lynette.
Fine.
We'll try the therapy.
All these weeks,
Sam has been going on
about how his mother was dead,
and the whole time,
she has been at Howe's market,
in a smock, stacking cans.
I guess my instincts about Sam
were right, wouldn't you say?
What did I say about gloating?
Something. I wasn't listening.
I was thinking about
how right I was.
Okay, I'll stop.
I know you're upset.
You have no idea.
When Sam first showed up,
I felt like I got a
little piece of Rex back.
It was wonderful.
But this has forced me to remember
that Rex was a liar, too.
Sorry. Am I interrupting something?
Orson, would you please excuse us?
Of course.
Everything all right?
Actually, Sam--
wait, wait. Still here.
I went back to the
supermarket today.
I take it you met my mother.
Why did you say she was dead?
She is dead... to me.
So you admit that you lied?
Did she tell you I found
a letter my father wrote,
begging her to let me
come live with him?
That's hardly an excuse.
I was 4.
He said he could give me all
the advantages she couldn't,
but she wouldn't let him.
She loved you.
She wanted you by her side--
she should have wanted more for me!
Andrew got bicycles for Christmas
and TVs for his birthday.
I had to sit in a trailer and
do my homework with mittens on
because my mom couldn't afford
to pay the heating bill.
If she had loved me,
she would have let me
live the life that
I was entitled to!
I'm...
Going to...
Talk to the... Schwartzmans
about their Bar Mitzvah.
If you want to go over the
menu later, let me know.
Oh.
Hey!
How'd it go?
Kind of weird,
but it was okay. Yeah?
I think you did very
good work today, Eddie.
Now the restroom is down the hall,
second door on the right.
I'll be here.
So you said "good work.
" Does that mean it went well?
That means Eddie's got some issues,
and it's going to take
time to work through them.
Okay... how much more time
at $130 an hour?
Well, it would go a lot faster
if we could get his mother in here,
but he seems to think there's
no way she'd agree to that.
Really? If you think it'll help,
I can get her in here.
That would be great.
Okay, and then...
And then everything
will be okay, right?
Let's just get the mother in here.
Barbara?
It's Lynette Scavo.
Barbara, we need to
talk about Eddie.
Hey.
Are you looking for
Barbara Orlofsky?
Yeah. Do you know where she is?
No. Nobody's seen her for days,
and her car's still there.
It's weird.
Hey.
There's this crazy
rumor going around
that you've got something for me.
Just an apology.
Well, as long as it comes
with one of your muffins,
I may just accept it.
Oh, Andrew.
Orson told me about Sam.
You were right from the start.
I never should have trusted him.
Wow.
I-I don't even need the muffin now.
Now that that's settled,
what are we gonna do about Sam?
That's easy. We get rid of him.
I don't think it's
gonna be that simple.
Why not?
I saw a side to him last night
that I've never seen before,
and to be perfectly honest...
(Whispers) I'm afraid of him.
Hi, Susan! Thanks for
having us over for dinner.
Oh, well, actually,
dinner was just an excuse.
I wanted to show you something.
(Gasps) Oh, my God!
You bought a piano?
Yes! And I wanted you to be
the first to see it.
Wow. That looks... pricey. $30,000,
plus delivery and tax and
a biannual tuning fee.
But Mike's on his way down.
Do me a favor. Don't let on that
you know how much it cost. Why not?
He thinks it's ostentatious,
and he's a little embarrassed.
In fact, he keeps telling everyone
that I inherited it from my aunt,
so just go with it.
Hey, guys. Sorry I'm late
that's okay, honey.
I'm gonna check on dinner.
We're gonna check on dinner.
Dude, we need to talk. A piano?
Oh, God, don't worry about it.
We didn't buy it.
Susan inherited it
from her dead aunt.
Wow. Without even blinking.
Uh, would anyone mind
helping me set the table?
Oh, Carlos will do it.
Oh, great. And, Mike,
maybe you and Gaby can get the wine.
So you and Carlos have any
big plans for the summer?
You taking any trips?
Gaby?
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Look, if, um, you need to talk...
Susan's in the other room.
(Chuckles)
I think Carlos is having an affair.
What? Why would you think that?
Because he's been acting
really secretive lately.
And I went to talk to
our business manager,
and I discovered $50,
000 was missing from our account.
Well, I'm sure there's
a good explanation.
(Cork pops) Yeah, there is.
It's called fancy dresses and
hotel rooms for some bimbo.
No, no, no. I am sure that
you've got that all wrong.
Wait a minute.
Are you covering for him?
No. I...
Because I stole his cell phone
to see who he was talking to,
and he called your house,
like, a hundred times.
Well, he hasn't been
talking to me.
Really? Well, the next time
he's not talking to you,
you might want to give him the
name of your divorce lawyer.
I'm so glad you guys
were free tonight.
We've been wanting to do this
for such a long--oh, my God!
What's wrong? My earring.
It's missing. Damn it!
I just got them today.
Oh, I'm sure it's somewhere.
Oh! Here it is. (Chuckles)
That would have been 3
grand out the window.
You bought $3,000 earrings?
Oh, of course not.
Mike did. He's so generous,
especially now that
we're loaded again.
You know, Carlos,
I never noticed before--
you have a really veiny forehead.
Hey, buddy, we got a bit
of a problem. No kidding.
Wait, you know?
Did Gaby say something?
No. I heard it all from Susan.
Huh. Well, it's not surprising,
the way those two talk,
but luckily, it's not true.
Come on, Mike. Let's stop the lies.
It is true, and we
both know it. It is?
Don't act surprised.
God, this whole thing was a mistake.
I never should have
written that check.
You paid for it? Oh, man.
Wh- (Susan) Dinner is ready.
Mmm! Susan,
everything smells so good.
Thanks.
You want some meatballs, Carlos?
I've got two nice,
big ones for you right here.
Nope. I'm fine.
I saw that.
Saw what?
You leering at Susan's breasts.
(Chuckles) I was
looking at the pasta.
Susan's breasts just happened
to be hovering nearby.
Gaby, leave Carlos alone.
Oh, my God. It's you.
Excuse me?
You're the one Carlos is
having an affair with.
What? What?
Makes perfect sense. That's why
there were all those phone calls
to this house from his cell phone.
You looked at my cell phone?
Yes, and thank God I did. Whore!
Shamelessly shoving your
meatballs in my husband's face.
There was no shoving.
Sometimes they spontaneously heave.
Have you lost your mind?
I am not having an affair with Susan.
Mike, you believe me, right?
Yeah... I guess.
It's just... why are you calling
over here all the time?
I'm not! I always call your cell!
Susan, say something.
Forget it, Carlos.
We might as well confess.
Confess what?!
You wouldn't take my money
when you were in trouble,
and, well, I've always known
that Carlos had a thing for me,
so I told him that I
would sleep with him
if he would loan you money.
(Gasps loudly)
You son of a bitch!
I didn't touch her.
All I did was help a
friend who screwed me over
buying diamond earrings
and grand pianos.
I told you, the piano was
a gift from Susan's aunt!
You bought diamond earrings?
Oh, yeah, with the $50,
000 that you borrowed from Carlos.
You know? Yeah!
So you two were just...
Screwing with you, yes.
So tell me, Mike,
do you feel betrayed, humiliated?
Good. Because I only did this
to show you what it feels like
when the person that is
supposed to love you the most
lies to you.
Well, I just did it 'cause
I want a ski chalet.
I just keep trying to
think what I can say
so you'll know how sorry I am.
Well, I do know,
and I'm not looking
for another apology.
What I am looking for is your word
that you will never freeze
me out like this again.
(Scoffs) I swear.
Good.
So is this everything?
Yep.
You sure you don't want
me to walk you through it?
No. I...
Just want to get a sense
of where we stand.
If I have any questions,
I'll ask you later.
Why are they putting you
in a coma on purpose?
Your--your brain seems fine.
It's not like you
think you're napol**n.
You don't think you're
Napoléon, do you?
There was some swelling
when they brought me in.
Now it's--it's pushing
against my skull.
They say this is gonna relieve it.
So how long are you gonna be out?
A couple of days.
And you know where you're gonna be?
With Danny.
Actually, I was thinking about
bringing him back. No way.
It's been three days.
Nothing's happened.
I'm starting to think
you were wrong.
No, Ange, we're not
taking any chances.
All right, you know what?
If I gotta drive you out of
town myself, I'm gonna do it.
No, no, no. Okay, okay, okay, okay.
If it'll keep you
from killing yourself,
I will go stay with Danny.
Thank you.
You're easy to get along with,
you know that?
(Patrick) Hey, Angie.
You don't seem surprised to see me.
Don't bother running upstairs.
I already found your gun.
Come on.
After all this time,
there's gotta be something
you want to say to me.
Go to hell.
Couldn't you come up
with something more
original than that?
I guess all this suburban living
forces you to think in clichés.
So it was you.
You ran over Nick.
Would you believe me
if I told you it was an accident?
I sent Danny away.
You will never find him.
That's okay. We're not that close,
seeing as how you
stole him from me.
Are you gonna kill me?
No.
I need you alive.
You are gonna do me a favor.
What kind of favor?
(Sighs) Can we discuss
it in the morning?
I've had an exhausting
couple of days,
what with searching
your house for firearms
and running down Dudley douche bag.
So...
Which way to the guest room?
You think I'm gonna
let you stay here?
How are you gonna stop me?
If you call the cops,
they'll arrest you and lover boy.
Aren't you afraid I'll
kill you in your sleep?
Angie,
if the last 20 years
have taught us anything,
it's that you're not
comfortable killing people.
And if you decide to run away,
just make sure
you stop by the hospital
and say good-bye to Nick,
because he won't be around
much longer after you've gone.
Patrick, please, don't hurt him.
Just do what I tell you, baby,
and I'll let you both live.
Mysterious men--
they make promises they have
no intention of keeping.
They tell lies to get
what they want.
They may be more dangerous
than they seem.
Yes, our mothers told us
we cannot trust the men
we don't know.
And those we do know?
Well, we can't always
trust them either.

Previously on...
Eddie added his mother
to his list of victims.
How'd it go? Well,
it would go a lot faster
If we could get his
mother in here.
Nobody's seen her for days.
Bree saw a disturbing side of Sam.
I'm afraid of him.
Susan attacked Mike's
financial problems.
So is this everything? Yep.
Gaby got the truth.
I got involved with a bad guy.
You're not talking about Nick,
are you? No, Danny's father--
A really bad guy.
Grab whatever you can
stuff in a couple of bags.
Not without you. I'll send Danny.
And Angie faced her worst fear.
Are you gonna kill me?
Can we discuss it in the morning?
And if you decide to run away,
say good-bye to Nick,
Because he won't be around
much longer after you've gone.
Angie Bolen was having
trouble sleeping.
She kept dreaming about her life
And the choices she had made.
After all, it was her decision
to drop out of college.
It was her idea to join a
group of Eco-terrorists.
She let herself fall in love...
With their charismatic leader.
And she agreed to
build him a bomb.
Angie knew her choices
had been bad ones.
How else could she
have ended up here...
With a man she despised?
Good mornin'.
How long you been sittin' there?
For a while.
I've been admiring your scar.
It is so beautiful.
What are you doing?
You should be proud.
It's a symbol of
what we accomplished.
We killed a guy. I'm not so proud.
What's one life
compared to the planet?
What we did was noble.
Tell that to his wife.
When did you stop loving me?
Was it while we
were still together,
Or was it after Nick
took you from me?
My wrist hurts.
Uncuff me.
Answer the question.
I never loved you.
That's a lie.
In fact, I'm thinkin'
there's a good chance
That you still do.
Don't touch me.
Maybe if we made love, you'd remember.
We could, but you
might not like it
When I vomit into your mouth.
You do realize I could kill you.
But you won't,
'cause you need me for somethin'.
That's true.
Well... don't just
keep me in suspense.
Tell me.
You're gonna make me another bomb.
You can never make me do that.
Yes, Angie Bolen had made a lot
of bad choices in her life.
You're gonna be surprised
by what I can make you do.
And she now had no choices left.
Detective John booth
was not happy.
You see,
Someone had been killing women
in the town of Fairview,
And he hadn't a clue
as to who it was.
For months,
He had pored over
autopsy photos...
Read psychological profiles...
And interviewed witnesses...
But Detective booth was still
No closer to finding the killer.
Until one day...
Booth speaking.
Really?
Yeah. Okay. We'll be right there.
What's up? Some kids came
across a woman's body
Buried in the woods.
Strangled?
We'll find out.
Forensics is over there
right now digging her up.
Hey, Eddie. We need to talk.
Did I do something wrong?
No. I went to your
house to see your mom.
You did?
Why?
I wanted to ask her to
come to therapy with you.
Dr. McCarthy thought
it might be helpful.
What did she say?
Actually, she wasn't there.
I don't want to worry you,
But her neighbor said no
one has seen her for days.
Look...
I'm sure that must sound
like a big deal to you,
But this has been going
on my whole life.
She's off on another bender,
And in a week or two,
She'll come back,
Like nothing ever happened.
So we don't need to call anyone?
You think she's okay?
Yeah. It's only a matter of
time before she turns up.
Okay, my plane's in an hour.
I wish you weren't gonna
be gone for your birthday.
The girls are gonna
be so disappointed.
The commission on this
deal is worth 40 grand.
I will dry their tears
with dollar bills.
Bon voyage. Mm.
And don't worry, I'll have
your favorite dinner waiting.
That's okay, babe.
We can just go out to
dinner and celebrate.
But I make you lasagna
every year. I know.
I just don't want you To have
to go through all the trouble.
That's all.
I gotta go. Hold it!
You do like my lasagna, don't you?
Sure, I do.
Liar! excuse me?
You were doing that thing you
do when you lie. What thing?
Oh, like I'm gonna tell you.
I don't believe this.
You've been eating my
lasagna for 11 years.
Actually,
The ficus in the dining room
has been eating it. What?
But on the bright side,
it's thriving.
So you're saying I
make great mulch? Look,
I just never wanted
to hurt your feelings.
Until today.
Well, I've gotten older.
My stomach's gotten weaker.
Look, I'm sorry, baby.
You just don't make it
the way mamá used to.
That's because your
backstabbing mother
Didn't have the decency to give
me the recipe before she died.
She was run over by a car!
Well, isn't that convenient?
Look, lasagna's a tough dish.
But I love your guacamole.
I buy that at the store.
Like only you can.
So... figure out my
financial mess yet?
I've been going over these
invoices for three days,
And I'm confused.
The payments don't cover
half of what you've billed.
Well, that's 'cause
not everybody's paid.
Why not?
?
Times are tough.
A lot of my customers
are struggling
Just to make ends meet. Wish I kw
what that was like.
Oh, wait. I do.
They'll pay when they can.
Honey, I love that I married a guy
Who wants to unclog the
world's toilets for free.
But now it's time
The people pay the
piper for the pipes.
It's not that easy.
I've known these people for years.
I can't just go shake 'em down.
You're right.
I'll do it.
You? Hey... how are
you gonna do it?
Look at me. Big brown eyes,
quivering lips.
Once I tell them how our
life is falling apart,
Trust me, they'll pay.
No, Susan, this will never work.
Fine.
But I don't know
what we're gonna do.
Uh, we barely have enough money
To pay our bills this month.
The insurance is due.
And God forbid m.J.
Get in an accident.
Susan, sweetie,
it's gonna be okay.
Still don't think it'll work?
Wow. You're scary.
Can I go get our money?
Be my guest.
Hey, hey! last year,
when I wanted to go fishing,
But you wanted to go
skiing and you started
crying- I think it's
best we don't discuss that
Until we're out of
this financial crisis.
I'm not scared of Sam.
If you're afraid to fire him,
I'll do it.
No! I don't want to provoke him.
The man is clearly troubled.
And there's no telling
how violent he could get.
Well, we're not intimidated.
Are we, Orson?
Just how violent are we talking?
Hey, we'll do whatever
it takes to protect mom.
Okay. But I am in a chair.
I don't know how good
I'd be in a fight.
This thing tips over
in a stiff wind.
Don't worry, Orson.
We'll think of something else.
What are you doing?
Did that hurt? No.
Well, that's all I got.
You don't need to fight, Orson.
You're more of a strategist.
O-okay, fine.
We don't want to fight.
Why don't we hire
someone to rough him up?
I know a couple ex-marines.
How do you know any- don't ask.
Hey, what about money?
What about it?
Well, if we can't fire
Sam or scare him away,
Maybe he'll respond to cash.
Yes, he's always talking about
how he never had anything
Growing up. I think,
one little severance package,
And we could be rid
of this problem.
Oh, brilliant idea, Orson.
You call writing a
check "brilliant"?
Anything?
Sorry.
Mrs. Scavo? Yeah?
I'm Detective booth.
This is Detective Furst.
Can we come in?
Sure. What's this about?
Do you know an Irina Kosokov?
Oh, unfortunately, yeah.
And whatever you think
she did, she did.
I'm sorry?
She's a conniving,
manipulative little grifter
Who put my son through hell.
She's dead.
What? Are you serious?
We found her body earlier today.
She was murdered.
What's going on?
Uh... these are policemen.
It's about Irina.
Oh, boy. That didn't take long.
Tom... that little bitch couldn't
even get out of the country
Before she... she's dead.
Was taken from us too soon.
Is your son Preston home?
No, he's camping with his brother.
But thank you so much for coming by.
He's gonna be devastated.
Actually, we're gonna
need to talk to him.
Wait. You don't think he had
anything to do with this?
We found a letter that Ms.
Kosokov had written to him.
Sounds like things ended
pretty badly between them.
Well, yeah, he broke
off the engagement.
But he wouldn't do
that and then kill her.
It's an extra step.
Wouldn't you just skip the breakup
And get right to the killing?
Why won't you stop talking?
I want to, believe me.
Just get him in as
soon as you can.
Sure. I'll call him right now.
Thank you.
I'm telling you,
There's no way Preston
could have hurt that girl.
You guys should concentrate
on finding the real killer.
Oh, don't worry. We'll find him.
Brings back memories, huh?
I'm not doing this.
I don't expect you to start today.
I'm still waiting
on one more piece.
It's not gonna happen.
Angie, there's this
development in Oregon.
They're planning to clear-cut 4,
000 acres of old growth.
We gotta stop them.
And who cares if we
kill a few loggers in
the process, right?
Saving the world's messy.
You used to be able to see that.
You know what I see now? A fake.
What?
You're a phony.
The only cause you ever
believed in is you.
I'm trying to save the planet!
Oh, God. You still have that ego.
I was trying to save you, too!
Oh, well, thanks for caring,
but Nick saved me,
And he showed me what a coward you
really are. Do you really wanna
Start talking about
Nick right now, huh?!
God, how does it feel,
Knowing you'll never
be half the man he is?
Angie, open up. It's Gaby.
She won't go.
I'm not going. I see your car.
You've got one minute
to get rid of her,
Or there's gonna be one less
neighbor at the block party.
Come on in.
Hey. I need a lasagna
recipe for Carlos. Hi.
Hi. I'm Anthony, Angie's brother.
Oh, you never told
me you had a brother.
I'm sure she hasn't
told you lots of things.
Uh, what kind of lasagna
does Carlos like?
Meat? Vegetarian?
Have you seen Carlos?
What's all this?
Somebody kill a toaster?
Angie's fixing my remote control,
Giving it a little extra power.
Oh. You know how to do that?
Sure.
She was an engineering
major in college.
Well, you know,
I have an appliance at home
That could use some extra power.
And once I get to know you better,
I'll tell you which one.
Got that recipe yet?
Here you go. Oh, thanks.
What does this s?
Ten fresh tomatoes.
Can't I just use sauce from a jar?
No, you can't just
use sauce from a jar!
You're right. No one will
ever know the difference.
See you later. Nice meeting you.
Oh, and a little word of advice--
Never compare your wife
to your dead mother
If you wanna get laid
on your birthday.
You know how to make a bomb
And you haven't
used one on her yet?
I admire your restraint.
You wanted to see me, Bree?
I did. Please, have a seat.
Did you know that Rex set up
A trust fund for Andrew and
Danielle? No, I didn't.
Well, he wanted to be sure they
had a nest egg to draw from
In case something happened
to him, which it did.
Why are you telling me all this?
Well, Rex set up two trust funds.
He seems to have forgotten
he had three children,
And that's not right.
That's a lot of money.
Well, it's my way of apologizing
Like this. Thank you. G
You're very welcome.
And I hope you know how
much I have appreciated
The time you spent with
us and the work you did.
Truly, I wish you the very best.
That sounds like a good-bye.
Well, now that you
have all this money,
You don't need to work here.
A young man with your
skills should feel free
To go out into the world
and make his mark.
But I like it here.
Well, unfortunately,
I no longer need you.
You see, Andrew and
I have made up,
And I'm giving him your job.
What?
Don't be angry.
This is, after all,
a family business.
But I'm part of the family.
Not... really.
What are you doing?
You can't buy me off.
I belong here.
I'm a Van De Kamp.
And if you ever insult me again...
You're gonna wish you hadn't.
Excuse me. Are you Jake Walker?
Yeah.
Hi. I'm Susan Delfino,
your plumber's wife.
Oh, hey. Yeah, Mike's, uh,
done us a few solids over here.
He's a good man.
Yes, and a proud man,
which is why he hasn't told you
That his business
is really hurting.
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
So we're gonna need
you to pay your bill,
Uh, for the work he completed...
four months ago.
Yeah...
I wish I could, but,
uh, it's a bad time.
You okay?
Oh, I'm sorry.
It's just, we're
having a bad time, too.
We can't cover our bills,
And the health insurance is due.
And God forbid...
Our son get in an accident.
Yeah, well, I wouldn't worry.
Kids bounce back.
"kids bounce back"?
That's your response?
Look, my wife lost her job.
My truck needs a new transmission.
Well, maybe we could set up a payment-
my daughter needs braces.
Even if it's just small- nifit...
Nifit? Th-that's not an excuse.
That's just a sound.
Look, lady, I don't
know how to tell you.
I don't have the money, okay?
So just leave me alone.
No, I'm not gonna leave you alone.
You owe me money, and I'm not
gonna rest until I get it.
I am gonna make sure
Everyone in your life knows
what a deadbeat you are.
When you go to work tomorrow,
I'll be there.
When you go bowling with
your buddies, I'll be there.
And when you go to your video
store to get your porn, I'll--
Okay, okay.
I'll write you a check.
Thank you.
So with the price of college
tuition being what it is,
And my mother had that
gallbladder operation,
Well, we're just a little
tapped out at the moment.
Well, I'm sorry to hear that.
But Mike did repipe your
entire second floor,
Didn't he?
Yes. And I want to pay,
But we just don't have the money.
Oh, that's too bad.
These are awfully cute.
Yes.
My husband gives me one every
year on our anniversary.
They're my babies.
Aw, that's so sweet.
Please be careful. I don't
like it when people touch them.
Oh, well, you know
what I don't like?
I don't like when people
take advantage of my husband.
It makes me feel all...
Clumsy.
I guess I could
maybe pay you half.
The whole thing.
Let me get my wallet.
We'll be waiting!
I know I'm late in paying
for the water heater,
But I'm on a fixed income.
There just isn't any money
left at the end of the month.
I mean, for me to even
pay for my medicines
I've had to cut down
to two meals a day.
S-so even though I'd
like to help, I can't.
I've got nothing.
You got a nice watch.
Damn right, "wow!" no cereal
for dinner tonight, baby!
Mrs. Crowley-
-Paid! Jim Peterson--paid!
And the ones that couldn't pay,
I took it in booty.
A clock?
Earrings.
A menorah?
Sterling silver.
Hey, Mrs. Gottleib has a toilet
that flushes, doesn't she?
What happened to batting your
eyes and shedding a few tears?
Playing the victim gome nowhere.
Everybody had an excuse,
and I bought it.
And then, all of a sudden,
I snapped.
Rage just started
pouring out of me.
It was like my inner
bully had been released.
And one by one, I brought the
deadbeats to their knees!
Ooh! for the first
time in my life,
I have gotten a taste of power.
And you know what?
I like it.
You do know that's
not a twist-off?
Yes! ow! that hurts.
I can't tell you what a rush it is
To have this adrenaline
pouring through me. Ooh.
Hey, I have an idea.
Let's go upstairs right
now and have bully sex.
Susan- I said now!
We can't.
Why not? I want to celebrate.
I brought home all
this money today.
We're getting closer and
closer to the finish line.
Well...
The I.R.S. Just moved
the finish line.
Oh, my God.
I know. We're screwed.
You know what?
Old victim Susan might have
agreed with you, but...
New bully Susan is not
gonna take this lying down.
The way I see it,
The I.R.S. Is a government agency,
And the government only exists
because of the taxes that we pay.
So that makes me your boss.
And as your boss, I am telling
you that we need an extension.
Do I make myself clear?
I am a terrible bully.
Yes. Yes, you are.
He didn't have to tack on
all those extra penalties.
-Did you know they could do that?
-Yeah.
-See, I didn't, or I never would have...
-Yeah, I figured.
So what do you think we should do?
I don't know.
Between the taxes and the rest of
the bills, we're still screwed.
We got nothing to fl back on.
We've got the house.
Sam.
Good. You're here. Come on in.
I thought you wanted to go
over the quarterly inventory.
Yes, but then some old
friends dropped by.
Sam Allen, I would like you to meet
Detective Turner and sergeant Clemente.
So... you're policemen.
Used to be. Bree catered
our retirement parties.
And did an amazing job.
Boy, do we owe her big.
Sam, have a seat. Have some tea.
No, thanks. I'm not
really a big tea guy.
Oh, come on. Take a load off.
We got, uh, we got
room here on the couch.
So... the officers were
just sharing some stories
From their days on the force.
Tell him the one you just told me.
About the guy who was
hassling the nice lady?
Yes. Sam, listen to this.
This guy was so crafty,
Knew just what to say
to scare the lady
Without technically
breaking the law.
Yeah, our hands were tied.
Nothing we could do.
That must have been
so frustrating. Scone?
Thanks. Oh,
it was very frustrating.
Of course, if we encountered
the same situation today,
We'd handle it very differently.
Oh? How?
Well, we'd sit him
down for a nice chat.
And, uh, if he wouldn't
listen to reason,
Then there are...
measures we could take.
Ooh. Sounds like a
Mickey Spillane novel.
What kind of measures?
Well...
You mind?
You pick up a phone Bo,
aim for the Adam's apple... Boom!
Let your fingers do the walking.
Or--or--or here. Help me out here.
You, uh, dislocate
those two fingers
And smack him on the hand.
Pop 'em back in.
And there's no evidence.
Goodness. It's hard to believe
you'd actually do such a thing.
Well, if I had to.
I mean, if the situation came up,
I would hope that the...
Threat would be enough.
Absolutely.
Sam, you're looking a little pale.
Would you like some more
tea or perhaps a macaroon?
No. I...
Think... I... should be going.
Hey, do you want us
to give you a ride?
I mean, we go right
past 474 Ash street.
I'm good.
I don't know why tea parties
have fallen out of fashion.
They're so much fun.
Okay, Porter. Do what you can to
keep your brother's spirits up.
Drive safely.
I--yeah, I'll see you soon. Mwah.
Hey, uh, Mrs. Scavo.
What's with the backpack?
Yeah, I've been thinking
that it might be good
If I move back home
for a little while.
Why?
Irina's dead.
Your family needs time
to deal with that.
You don't need me hanging around,
getting in the way.
To be honest, I already
think of you as family.
C-come on.
I've only been here
a couple of weeks.
Your first morning here, you asked
if you could take out the trash.
Believe me, you were in my
will by 3:00 that afternoon.
Seriously,
I think you should stay.
I want to, but...
My mom's gonna be back from
her bender any day now,
And I should be there.
Oh. That's so sweet of you.
Your mom's lucky to
have a son like you.
You know...
Once you make sure she's okay,
You can always come back.
I don't think that's gonna happen.
Is something wrong?
D-did you not like it here?
No. No, it was fantastic.
I should just go. That's all.
Okay. Well, can I give
you a hug good-bye?
I can't help thinking,
I would've turned out so
different if you were my mom.
What do you mean you're
moving off the lane?
You can't sell your house.
We're not selling. We're renting.
I don't care. Either way,
you're not gonna be living here.
Lynette, say something.
You're very persuasive.
I... I don't understand
why you have to do this.
Well, we dug ourselves in
pretty deep financially.
We'll be fine.
It's just gonna be for a while.
Checkbooks.
No, no.
I love you for that, but no.
We got ourselves into this.
We can get ourselves out.
Where will you go?
We found an apartment
near the school.
And there's a park
around the corner.
And it's close by, so we'll
still be able to see each other.
I hope so.
'cause people always
say that and then...
Well, I mean it.
So do we.
Ma?
Danny? What are you doing here?
What are you talking about?
You texted me.
You told me to hurry home.
Oh, God, that wasn't me.
Danny, get out of the house now.
What's going on?
Just go, Danny. Go.
What's the rush?
Remember that piece
I said w missing?
It just arrived.
So I've been thinking...
What are you doing here?
You know, about what
your cop friends said
About how effective
threats can be.
I think they're right.
Get out.
I will,
But not before we do
a little business.
What kind of business?
I want you to sign over
your company to me.
What?
I'm talking about
your catering clients,
Your cookbooks,
the frozen food line--
All of it.
Why would I do that?
Remember the dinner you threw
to welcome me to the family?
Well, Danielle h a
little too much to drink.
I hear that's genetic.
Anyway, she got pretty chatty.
Kept asking me why I wanted To
join a family with so many secrets.
Uh, what did she tell you?
The same thing I'm gonna
tell some of my cop friends.
Oh, and while I'm at it,
I should probably tell
Carlos Solis, too.
I don't know what
you're talking about.
I'm talking about Andrew,
Your son,
Getting into a car
And running down Carlos' mother.
So should we draw up theapers
now or wait till morning?
It's a lot to take in, I know.
I don't believe you.
Look, I'm just trying
to let you know
That when you're ready,
I want us to have a traditional
father-son relationship.
Are you serious?
I know.
That sounded ridiculous.
And I'm sorry I had to tie you up.
Believe me, this is not how
I wanted this to happen.
But I have something
important to do.
Once I'm done, I'll untie you,
And we'll have time to
get to know each other.
If you ever untie me,
I'll kill you!
You're mad. I get it.
But eventually,
you realize who you're mad at.
It's not the guy who spent
20 years looking for you.
It's the people who spent
20 years lying to you.
Did you say to Danny?
Just a father/son chat.
I swear, if you ever hurt him...
God, everybody makes me
sound like such a villain.
So...
How's my bomb coming?
It would go a lot faster
if could use two hands.
Well, we are on a deadline.
Hello?
Not her again.
I come bearing gifts.
Hello?
You've got 20 seconds to get
her the hell outta here.
Hey. Sorry to barge in,
but I did a test run,
And I really need
your opinion. Now?
Yeah. This has to be the
best lasagna in the world,
So when I shove it down Carlos' throat,
he'll know I care.
She'll try it later.
Thanks for stopping by.
Oh, I'm not going.
She won't go.
Mnh-mnh. Let me just cut a piece.
Two seconds. 'cause don't forget,
Danny's waiting for you.
Be right back, Gaby.
Well, I can tell you this much,
it smells great.
Oh, come on.
This is my first magazine cover.
Ooh. And this is me
when I did "vogue."
Oh, that's my daughter Juanita.
I don't know how that
got in there. Oh!
And now the runway years.
Angie! you're keeping
your friend waiting.
Be right there.
Oh, jeez. You scared
the crap outta me.
I'm about to kill your neighbor.
You might want to
get her outta here.
Gaby, I gotta hand it to you.
You did a great job.
Really? You're not
just saying that?
Oh, fantastic. But would you
mind taking the rest back?
I'm just trying to
watch my weight.
I get it.
You're trying to cut out
all the crappy food.
Did Mrs. Bolen like the lasagna?
Well, she said she did,
And then she pretended
she was on a diet.
Well, I guess I can take a hint.
Honey, do you really
think this is the time
To be cleaning out your purse?
Our son is being
interrogated for murder.
I have a lot of rage in me.
Would you rather I channel
it into this or you?
I'd put the emergency
tampon in the zipper pouch.
Thank you.
Pres, how'd it go?
They just wanted to confirm the timeline
I was in Europe this past year.
That's it?
I guess they think the guy
who killed all those girls
While I was gone is the same
one who strangled Irina.
Oh, thank God.
So you're free and clear?
You okay? I just keep thinking,
Irina would still be alive
If I hadn't brought her here.
I'll meet you at the car.
Sweetie, when--
Mom, let him go. This whole
thing has really hit him hard.
How about Porter
and I take him out,
Shoot a few games of pool,
see if he wants to talk?
Okay. I'll see you back at home.
Did you hear they found a
second body in the woods?
They think it's some local woman--
Barbara Orlofsky.
Orlofsky? Isn't that that woman
We throw in the drunk
tank about once a month?
That's her.
Oh, my God! what are you doing?
We were hungry. So you
picked it out of the trash?
You're worse than raccoons.
Sorry.
Well, since you had some,
what'd you think?
Oh, yeah? Well, the French toast
you made me for mother's day
Wasn't so hot either.
What the heck is that?
-Eddie.
-Mrs. Scavo.
What are you doing here?
Oh, sweetie...
Oh, look, I know you're worried
But you can relax.
I just spoke to her.
You just... spoke to her?
Yeah, like, a half-hour ago.
Uh, she's at my Uncle
Pete's in Florida.
In fact, I-I was--
I was just getting ready
to fly down there...
And... we're gonna...
Try to check her into rehab.
So if you don't mind...
Oh, thank God. They must
have gotten the name wrong.
What are you talking about?
Well, I was just at the
police station with Preston.
They found another body,
and they said it was your mom's.
But...
You just talked to her, right?
They made a mistake.
You didn't just talk to her.
And your mom's not
in Florida, is she?
I really wish you
hadn't come here.
People make choices every day.
And those choices...
Are what define us.
Some of us choose to be loyal,
Though we're angry and hurt.
Some of us choose to be brave,
Though we're frightened
out of our minds.
Others choose to strike out
When they could have walked away.
But what about those poor people
Who are trapped by circumstance?
What happens to those
Who have no choices left?

Previously on Desperate
Housewives...
Why didn't you tell me you
were having money problems?
Susan made a difficult decision.
You can't sell your house.
We're not selling. We're renting.
Bree was blackmailed by Sam.
I'm talking about your son
running down Carlos' mother.
I want you to sign over
your company to me.
Patrick got what he needed
to force Angie to
do what he wanted.
You're gonna make me another bomb.
But Angie managed to send
out a call for help...
And Lynette discovered
that Eddie was the killer.
In those first awful moments,
all Lynette Scavo could
think of were her children.
She thought of the moment her
daughter began to walk...
And the day her son won
the spelling bee...
And that time her twins
scared her with a frog.
Yes, this is what
Lynette thought about...
While a disturbed young man
was holding her hostage.
Eddie, please.
Don't talk to me, Mrs. Scavo.
I really need to think.
I know you must be scared.
But I am your friend, Eddie.
I want to help.
Look, what... what...
what can you do?
You can't do anything.
I can tell people what a mean,
angry drunk your mother was,
How she abused you,
how defenseless you are.
You almost didn't have a choice.
And what about the others?
What others?
The other girls I killed.
Oh.
Still think you can
help me? Look...
I don't want to hurt you.
Look, we'll drive till we're
in the middle of nowhere.
I'll drop you off, and by the time
you find anyone to tell, I'll be gone.
No.
Look, I don't know what else to do.
I can't have you going to the police.
I can't go anywhere.
Yes.
All Lynette could think
about were her children...
My water just broke.
Especially the child she
was about to give birth to.

***
Teresa Pruitt used to be a nurse.
For 33 years, she worked
in the maternity ward
at Fairview Memorial Hospital.
She spent her days caring
for newborn infants...
And looking after
brand-new mothers.
It was a job she had
loved with all her heart.
But that was many years ago.
Now Teresa Pruitt was back
at Fairview Memorial...
But this time as a patient...
A patient with a secret.
Hello, Teresa.
I came as soon as I could.
I'm so sorry.
Don't be.
It's my time.
You're very brave.
Hmm, I wish that were true, Father.
Did you know I used to be
a nurse in this hospital?
Yes. You just retired a
few years ago, right?
I didn't retire.
I quit out of guilt.
What do you mean?
I did something awful.
Do you want to take confession?
No. Confessions are private,
and the people who
run this hospital
need to know what I did...
Because they have to make it right.
Oh! Excuse me.
I need to see Nick Bolen.
What room is he in?
Oh, I'm sorry.
Visiting hours don't
start until 9:00.
Okay, but this is an emergency.
Ma'am, he just came
in out of a coma.
Unless you're immediate family,
you need to come back at 9:00.
Okay, I get it.
You're just following the rules.
You're a nurse... an underpaid,
underappreciated nurse
who might need some
help making ends meet.
So what do you say to...
ahem... $12?
Oh, wait. I'm gonna
need $10 for parking.
Ma'am.
How about gum? Do you like gum?
Come back later.
Hey, Lorna, Dr.
Burke needs you in radiology.
Thanks.
Hey! You with the ponytail.
I gotta see Nick Bolen.
Are you family?
Forget about it.
I'm his wife Angie.
Really? Well, then who's that
blonde lady who's been here?
His whore?! She was here? Oh,
I'm having her whacked!
Oh, no! I could be wrong.
Maybe I should get my supervisor.
Do I look like I got
time for supervisors?
I got sauce on the stove,
ziti in the oven
and a mustache that needs
to get bleached. Let's go!
Come on! Let's go!
Thank you.
W... wow.
Did we... did we get
hammered last night or what?
No, you got hammered.
Preston and I just followed you
around apologizing to everyone.
Mm, another thing we won't
be telling your mom.
Hey, do you think I woke
her up when I came in?
When you came in?
Yeah.
No. When you jumped
up on the coffee table
and sang "Margaritaville"? Maybe.
Guys. I just checked on mom,
and she's not there,
and the bed looks like
it hasn't been slept in.
Oh, god. She did hear me.
Oh, she must have stormed
out of here first thing.
But why didn't she wake
you up and yell at you?
Have I been stabbed?
You're back.
What happened with Sam?
And did you tell him his
services were no longer needed?
I tried to. He responded
by blackmailing me.
What?
He knows what
happened to Mrs.Solis.
Gaby. What does she
have to do with this?
I'm talking about Carlos' mother.
What happened to Carlos' mother?
Ten years ago, she died
after being hit by a car
that Andrew was driving.
Oh, my god.
How did he find out?
Danielle told him.
What? Why?
I don't know.
I think it was some idiotic
attempt to bond with him.
Wait a minute.
You never told Carlos and Gaby?
Of course not. That would
have destroyed the friendship,
not to mention Carlos would
have sent Andrew to jail.
So what does Sam want?
My company, and I'm
going to give it to him.
Are you crazy?
If I don't, he'll go to the police.
Let him.
Andrew!
Mom, I'm not letting you give
up everything you've worked for
just 'cause that psycho thinks
he has something over on us.
They will send you to prison.
Well, maybe it's time I paid for what I've done.
Absolutely not.
Bree, you can't give in to blackmail.
It's not right.
And if Andrew wants to
take responsibility...
Orson, this is really just
between me and my son.
Would you mind?
Of course not.
What's going on?
Why am I wet?
Beats me. I'm not a doctor.
Gaby, what are you doing here?
Angie's in trouble.
Look, she wrote me this note.
***
I don't understand.
There was a guy with her.
He said he was her brother.
She doesn't have a brother.
Is it Patrick Logan?
You know about Patrick?
She told me everything.
Whoa, whoa, what are you doing?
I gotta get him outta there.
Wait. Are you crazy?
In your condition?
Why can't we just call the cops?
Because the second
Patrick feels cornered,
Angie and Danny are dead.
Oh, my god.
Are you gonna be all right?
No. You're gonna have to drive me
to help me get him outta there.
Okay.
I know. I'm sorry. I'm putting
you in a dangerous position.
Forget about it.
So you're done?
Yes.
When you push the detonator,
you got 30 seconds till it blows.
You got what you wanted.
You gonna let us go now?
Not yet. You're coming
with me to Oregon.
You didn't say anything about that.
Ange...
What if the bomb's a dud?
I mean, you did run off with
another man and take my son.
I've got some trust issues.
Will you at least let Danny go?
No. See, if the
bomb doesn't go off,
I'll put a bullet in your head
and then come back and kill him.
So...
You sure you're done?
I guess I could take another look.
My grandson's visiting.
He'll love this.
How about we give you 100 bucks?
Look at the price tag. 50 cents.
Please, Susan. Let us help you.
I don't need my arthritis
medication this month.
Look, I can almost make a fist.
Thank you, but we're not looking
for a handout. Just a hand.
Hey, I just got off
the phone with Lee.
He thinks he might have found a renter.
Already?
Well, that's a good thing,
isn't it?
Yeah, yeah. It's great.
Stranger living in
my house... yippee!
Hey, Susan, how much for
this dining room set?
I paid $1,200 a year ago.
You can have it for $300.
I'll give you 50 bucks.
I thought you weren't looking
for a handout, just a hand.
That's not a hand. That's a finger.
Susan, I'm not neighbor Kinsky right now.
I'm business Kinsky.
So I'm gonna be frank.
You don't have a pot to
pee-pee in right now,
and our neighborhood knows it.
What's it gonna be?
Jeez, Kinsky. Have a heart.
The woman needs the money.
Oh, keep out of it, McCluskey.
You know the yard sale game.
If you lost the stomach
for it, walk away.
No, Mitzi. You walk away.
Excuse me?
You're nothing but a vulture.
I want you off my property.
Hey, lookie here.
I'm on a public sidewalk.
Now what you gonna do?
Mitzi, I am not "neighbor" Delfino.
I am "woman who's about
to move into an apartment
behind a gas station" Delfino,
and if you don't
get out of my face,
I am gonna ram this thigh
master down your throat.
Fine. $300.
Sold.
I found some aspirin.
Will that help?
This isn't a headache.
These are contractions.
I need you to take
me to a hospital.
No, I can't, you'll
tell someone about me.
Eddie, I swear to god.
I don't care about you right now.
All I care about is
this baby. Please.
Porter, I found her.
She's at Eddie's.
If I'm not back in 15 minutes,
it means she did not
accept my apology,
and it was fun being your dad.
Okay. I'm trusting you here.
Thank you. You have my word.
Eddie! It's Tom!
I need to talk to her again.
Quiet.
Honey! I can see your car.
I know you're in there.
Lynette!
Okay, I get it.
You're giving me the
silent treatment.
Well, when you cool off,
I will be home
with a gigantic bouquet
of your favorite flowers.
I'm sorry.
I had to do that.
I'll take you to the hospital now.
It's too late. It's too late.
This baby is coming now.
And you have to help me deliver it.
Mr. Chase, you got a minute?
Oh, sure, father. Come on in.
I just came from Teresa
Pruitt's bedside.
She passed.
I'm sorry to hear that.
I, uh, I remember her fondly.
She was one of my best nurses.
Before she died,
she told me something...
An awful secret that she'd
been living with for years.
Uh, father, I'm, uh,
I'm not trying to tell you
how to do your business,
but aren't those things
supposed to be confidential?
She wanted you to hear this,
but I think you
should sit down first.
Hey, lady, unless you want
to be carried into the truck,
You need to get off that chair.
I see. Like you're
the mover. Funny.
Have you seen T-Rex?
The dinosaur? Well,
check in the boxes.
No, honey. We sold it to Roy.
No!
Yeah. You put it
in the "sell" pile.
What's a "sell" pile?
Uh-oh.
I want my T-Rex.
Well, buddy, I'm sorry. We sold it,
so there's no way we can...
We're getting it back.
What are you doing?
Loving my child.
Thank you, Mommy.
Susan, I don't think you
should have promised him that.
Roy bought it for his grandson.
It's bad enough that
we are dragging him
from the only home
he has ever lived in,
moving across town where he
doesn't know a single soul.
If that silly dinosaur brings
him a moment's comfort,
then we need to march over
there and take it back.
What the hell? We're moving.
Let's go piss off some neighbors.
And somehow the dinosaur
got into the pile,
And now M.J. is begging
us to get it back.
Sorry for the confusion, Roy.
No, I get it. It's just...
I already gave it to my grandson.
Aw, I remember when
we gave it to M.J...
Right after his puppy died.
Okay, okay.
Let's go get it before
you take out your violin.
I guess the excitement
of getting a new friend
wore him out.
I'll wake him up.
Oh, you don't have to do that.
Why don't you just slip
it out of his arms?
And we'll leave a note.
A note?
And cash. Mike,
give the man some cash.
No, we're not taking money.
He's got tons of other toys.
He'll be fine.
Oh, god, he's deaf.
Shouldn't we stop this?
Just let it play out.
There you go.
You are now the sole owner
of Mrs. Van De Kamp's
old fashioned foods.
Of course, my lawyers
will have to approve this.
Of course, and you'll
see there's a codicil.
If you breathe one word
of Andrew's involvement
in that incident,
You'll be forced to pay
me all sorts of money.
Don't worry. I'm much
better at keeping secrets
than your daughter.
One can only hope.
I didn't want it to be this way.
And I understand if
you need to hate me.
I don't hate you, Sam.
I feel sorry for you.
You came into my life
hoping to be a part of my family,
and all you're leaving with
is a client list,
some mixing bowls and my name.
Well, you'll soon see
that's not enough.
You'll always have a
hole in your heart
because you don't really
care about anybody,
and I have a horrible feeling
that no one will ever
really care about you.
Now would you please be a dear
and close the door on
your way out of my life?
So I'm gonna put the
bomb in the trunk,
And that's how long you have
to say good-bye to our son.
***
You can't go with him.
He's never gonna let you come back.
I don't know how this
is gonna play out,
But whatever happens,
you gotta know,
that I was out of choices.
Okay, Angie. Car's loaded.
Come on.
We got a bomb to explode.
Okay, okay. I gotta push again.
No, you have to look.
But it's so gross!
I don't care. You're going to to have to catch her. Go.
I see something!
I think it's the head!
Aah!
Wait. There's something
around her neck!
What?
I think it's the umbilical cord.
No! No!
She's turning blue.
Okay. Okay. Um...
Listen to me.
You have to...
hook the umbilical cord
with your finger and
pull it over her head.
No, I can't.
You have to!
No, Mrs. Scavo, I'm serious!
Listen to me.
You have the chance
to save... a life.
Please!
Okay.
Oh, oh, is it done?
Yeah. I got her.
Yes! Yes! Yes.
She's okay?
Oh!
Ahh!
Thank you.
I know.
Where is he?
I'm sorry, sweetie.
T-Rex is extinct.
Yeah, buddy. I'm sorry we
couldn't get him back for ya.
But he's mine. That's not fair.
M.J...
That's life.
Life isn't always fair.
Sometimes you can be a good person
and you can do the right thing,
and life still won't give
you your dinosaur back.
In other words,
we're gonna take
you to pizza world,
and you can play all the
video games you want.
Okay.
Susan, life didn't
take your dinosaur.
I did.
So please, just let me have it.
Okay. Yeah.
I resent you.
I love you, I respect you,
but you know what?
I mean, you blew it!
And thanks to you,
I have to leave the home where
I raised my children. Look.
Look, this... this
is how tall Julie was
when she started kindergarten.
And... and this is
her in junior high.
And this is M.J.
The day we brought him home from
the hospital and stood him up.
And this... this is where
I thought he'd get to.
Here.
In this house...
And now I'm never gonna know,
and it's all your fault.
There it is.
Hey.
We're gonna get it back.
I promise.
And in the meantime...
***
***
Well... that's done.
It's Sam's company now.
So you did it.
You actually gave up a business
you spent eight years building.
What other choice did I have?
I can always start a new company.
What I cannot do is
send my son to jail.
You sent me to jail.
You insisted I turn myself in.
You said it was the only
way you'd take me back.
That was a completely
different situation.
Really?
I ran over Mike and told no one.
Andrew ran over Carlos'
mother and told no one.
How is that different?
Andrew was a child at the time.
He's not anymore.
Orson, please.
I don't mean to upset you.
I'm just curious why
you're not demanding Andrew
do the same thing as well.
Fine. I was wrong.
I never should have asked
you to make that sacrifice.
I don't want an apology.
I respected you for
demanding better of me.
You showed me you had
principles and ideals.
You insisted I live
up to your standards,
and I loved you for it.
What are you saying?
From the moment you told
me what Andrew had done
and what Sam was threatening to do,
I saw this as a test,
and I hoped worth all my
heart that you would pass it,
but you have failed miserably.
Where are you going?
Pack my suitcase. I'm leaving.
What?
You are not the woman
I thought you were.
For god sakes, Orson.
He's my son. I have no choice.
We always have a choice,
and I no longer choose
to be your husband.
All right,
I'm gonna go around back,
see if I can climb in a window.
You think you can keep Patrick
occupied for ten minutes?
Honey, you're talking to a woman
who never paid for a drink
in her life. Please.
Oh, man.
You okay?
Yeah. Just a little light-headed.
Just give me a second.
By the way, thank you.
I can't believe you're
helping us out like this.
I don't know. I guess it's...
I guess it's because
I know what it's like
to have secrets, too.
It's a lonely feeling.
And that night on the plane
when Angie told me hers,
I promised I would help her...
Whatever it takes.
Nick? Nick.
Oh, my god. Don't pass out.
Nick!
Come on! I can't do this alone.
She's so small.
Not for long.
They grow up so quickly.
I wish I could see her grow up.
So... I'm gonna go now.
If you could just...
Wait a while before
you call the police.
Wait.
That day you left my house,
you told me your life would
have turned out different
if I had been your mom.
So I'm gonna be your mom... Now.
Will you listen to me?
I don't think you should leave.
I think you should stay
here and call the police.
I can't.
Yes, you can.
I don't want to spend the
rest of my life in jail.
Honey... Don't you see
you're already there?
No matter where you run to,
in your head,
you will still be angry.
You'll still be in pain.
And as long as you want
to keep hurting people,
You will never be free.
I'll be good. I swear.
But people will never
see that you're good
Unless you show them.
Please, if you pick up the phone,
they will know.
And I will be so proud of you.
Will you call them for me?
Of course.
Why don't you hold the baby?
Hello. Fairview hospital?
I need to know how to bring
someone out of a coma.
I'm not sure if it's a coma.
Somewhere between a coma and a nap.
How should I know if he's clammy?
I left him in the car.
Gaby?
Hey, Susan, what's up?
Just came to say good-bye.
Okay. All right. See ya.
Oh, no. I mean, this is it.
Tomorrow's moving day,
and it's gonna be crazy,
So I didn't want to rush
through our good-byes.
Oh, good for you.
I'll catch ya when I catch ya.
Hello? Hello? Damn it!
Oh! Susan! Uh...
I'm sorry. I'm just so
choked up about you leaving.
I just couldn't deal with it.
Oh!
Really?
You know who else is gonna
be devastated? Angie.
Angie Bolen?
Yes. She's totally
broken up about this.
You've gotta say good-bye.
Seriously? I...I mean,
I like her and everything.
I just... we've had our problems.
Oh, just neighbor stuff.
Well, I tried to crush
her son with his car.
One of her favorite stories.
And then she attacked
me with a bat.
She's Italian.
That's love. Now come on.
You know, Angie once told me
that a good-bye
doesn't mean anything
if it doesn't last ten minutes.
Really? I don't think
Angie and I have ever had
a conversation that
lasted more than...
Gaby?
Okay. Uh...
It's getting late. Let's go.
Yeah, these aren't gonna
draw any attention.
Not as much as a bullet in
the head if you try to run.
It's my neighbor, Susan.
Someone really needs
to thin this herd.
Get rid of her.
Susan. What's going on?
Uh... Tomorrow's moving day.
I just came to say good-bye.
Okay... Bye.
Don't you want my new address?
Relax, Ange. This will be
over before you know it.
It's okay, Danny.
I'm gonna get you out of here.
Oh!
Why are we stopping?
What's the range on this thing?
About 200 yards?
Yeah. Why?
Patrick, what are you doing?
When I woke up that
morning 20 years ago,
and you were gone,
I was devastated.
I tried to forgive you,
but I couldn't.
After all, you didn't
just betray me.
You betrayed everything
we believed in.
So I decided one day
I would find you...
And I would punish you.
And today is that day, my love.
Where's the bomb?
There's 30 seconds from the
time I push this detonator
till the explosion...
that's what you said, right?
Tell me where the bomb is now!
It's in your house.
And if you want to save our son,
I suggest you get moving.
Come on. Hurry. I gotta help my mom.
I'm trying!
Okay.
It's in the detonator.
You bitch.
Mom?
***
Oh, Gaby. We can't take this.
This is too much.
I insist.
Although I am gonna
need $10 for parking.
So... this is good-bye.
Forever, right?
I mean, that's how this works?
Yeah.
You know what's funny?
Nick had to drag me here
kicking and screaming.
He told me it would be a
good place to blend in
because people wave at you
from behind their
little picket fences,
but they would never get involved.
They don't care.
Well, thank god you
proved him wrong.
Take care.
So we better hurry.
Bus is leaving in five minutes.
Yeah. We should
give him his ticket.
This is a ticket to New York.
I thought the plan
was to go to Atlanta.
That's our plan.
No way.
Listen to me.
I want to be with you guys.
And we wanna be with you,
but we have to stop being selfish.
She's right. It's time we
let you live your life.
You're gonna have so
much fun in New York.
You get to be with Ana.
You can see grandma.
And you can finally stop running.
But I'll still get to see you
guys every once in a while.
Right? I mean, Patrick's dead.
The FBI is still looking for us.
I don't think I can do this.
I'm not ready for...
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
You are gonna be fine, okay?
Because you...
You have turned into
one hell of a man.
Yeah.
If I am...
It's 'cause you were my father.
Mom?
Why is all of Orson's stuff gone?
He left me.
What? Why?
He feels I'm a hypocrite.
That's ridiculous.
No. He's right. I am.
Is there anything I can do?
There is.
You can give me your
permission to do something
I should have done a long time ago.
This is bad.
What if we don't say anything?
The nurse is dead.
Nobody else knows.
The priest knows.
I don't suppose we
could buy him off.
Just a suggestion.
If this leads to a lawsuit,
we have no defense.
This could ruin the hospital.
Jack, what's wrong?
I know one of these families.
They live two blocks
from me on Wisteria Lane.
Then maybe you're the
best person to tell them.
And how do I do that?
How do you tell parents the
child they've been raising...
The child they love...
isn't really theirs?
***
Hey there. What's going on?
Susan trying to sneak off without saying good-bye.
The more I thought about it,
the more I realized
it's not a big deal.
I'm just moving across town.
I'm gonna see you all
Friday for poker.
You better, 'cause if we don't
hear from you once a week,
we will hunt you down and bring you back. You know that, right?
I do.
So who's renting your house?
Lee found a guy.
It's just not gonna seem right,
someone else in your house.
Yeah. Well, whoever the guy is,
he is very lucky,
'cause he's about to get himself
three of the most
wonderful neighbors
a person could ask for.
You know, sometimes when
you see people every day,
you forget to tell them
how much they mean to you
so for the record...
I think the three of you
are such good people.
And you've made me a better person,
and I thank you for that.
Hey, Susan, I hate to interrupt,
but we really gotta get going.
I should go check
on Tom and the baby.
I'm sure one or both will need to be fed.
Go, go.
I'll call you all in the morning.
Okay.
Honey, what's wrong?
What Susan said...
It's not true.
I'm not a good person.
Oh, that's silly.
Of course you are.
No, I'm not. There's
something I need to tell you
I should have told you
years ago but I didn't.
You sound so serious. What is it?
It's the kind of thing that
could end our friendship.
Can we go talk?
Well... you ready?
Yeah.
Drive away slow, okay?
***
As they pulled away,
Susan looked out on the
street she loved so much...
A street where parents could
raise their children...
Where retirees could enjoy
their golden years...
Where good friends
could share horrible secrets...
Yes, Susan looked on this street
and vowed she would be back...
But as she did so,
she didn't notice the
car that passed her...
A car carrying Wisteria Lane's...
Newest resident.
So I have some paperwork
for you to sign over here,
and once we get this done,
I can give you the keys.
And I just know you're
really gonna like it here.
People are friendly,
relatively quiet.
It's just... it's just
a lovely neighborhood.
Oh, I know the
neighborhood very well.
The truth is, I used to live here.
Oh, well, then I guess
everyone will be surprised
to see you again.
They absolutely will.
