5 years ago,
Susan Delfino gave birth to
a son in delivery room A in hospital.
Moments later,
Lelar Dash gave birth to
a daughter in delivery room B
Around 10 at next morning,
As the two new mothers
were leaving the hospital.
They nearly ran into each other.
Of course, they never knew this.
In fact, Susan and Lelar
would have been surprised to know
How often their pasts
would cross over the years.
They most met in
the loc coffee shop
And another time at
their veterinarian office.
And again in the bleacher
of Fairview flyers.
But despite these close calls,
Susan and Lelar never met.
Until one Tuesday,
When Susan decided to take
her husband to a fancy restaurant
For their anniversary.
At the same time,
Lelar decided to take her
daughter to buy some ice-cream.
That was the night that
Susan Delfino and Lelar Dash.
Finally, ran into each other.
Mike.
It will happen to all of us eventually.
The moment will come when we ask ourselves...
Where did the time go?
How did the children I once cradled...
Grow up so very quickly?
How did the life I dreamt of...
Turn into a career I never expected?
And how did that woman
I saw each day in the mirror...
Become someone I don't even recognize?
Juanita, this dress is awfully tight.
I don't think you can get into it.
No, it's pretty. I can do it.
How's that one fit?
Oh, I think we're gonna need the next size up.
Uh, there is no next size up.
They don't make princess
dresses for girls over 7.
She's only 4 1/2.
Look, my daughter was
invited to a princess party,
So I can't let her
Be the only girl there
without a princess dress.
Did you try the costume section?
I bet they'd have a mrs.
Shrek dress that would fit her.
Juanita, take off the dress! We're going.
No! I can do it.
Look, I feel for you.
My niece so has a weight problem.
My daughter does not have a weight problem
She has a little baby fat, that's all.
In fact, the only problem she has
Is this store being completely unprepared
For a perfectly average 4-year-old girl.
Just ring it up.
No, no, no!
Oh, for god sakes. What's wrong now?
Once again,
The concept is, sweetie,
You're taking the pie out of the oven,
Your face aglow with surprise.
Why am I surprised? Because
it turned out so perfectly.
Well, that's no surprise.
My pies are ways perfect.
all right. It's your best pie ever.
You've topped yourself. Hmm?
Mm. And I know this before I've tasted it?
Sweetie, just make whatever face you want.
I just think you'll sell more cookbooks
If you don't look like
You just made love to an ice cube.
Andrew, dear, I'm going to take a little break.
Would you please tell this gentleman
That if he calls me "sweetie" one more time,
I'm gonna grab his camera
and take picture of his colon
You got that, right?
katherine, hi. What are you doing here?
The waiters need to be paid,
And you took the key to the cashbox... Again.
Oh. Sorry. Paid for what?
The armenian wedding? Lunch for 300?
It was right after the
breakfast for the garden club,
Which you so missed. Look, I'm sorry.
I didn't know a photo
shoot would take this long.
I mean, who knew it'd be this
hard to pose for a book cover?
Oh, you'll be fine.
If there's one thing you're really good at,
It's posing as a chef. Okay, katherine.
I know this book has
been monopolizing my time,
And you feel overworked and undervalued.
But I do appreciate you.
In fact, I have a gift for you.
It's the galleys of my new book.
Read page 2.
"for katherine Mayfair--
"a wonderful cook
And an even better friend."
You dedicated it to me?
Well, you make this all possible.
It's the least I could do.
Ahem! Excuse me.
Time is money. Chop-chop, sweetie.
Andrew... Do we have a backup pie?
Yes. Yes, we do.
Good.
And the big blind...
Catches a jack on the river.
Preston?
Mom!
What the hell's going on here?
Don't freak out.
We're just playing cards.
Oh, yeah? Why didn't you play at home?
Why did you have to sneak in here?
Tequila shots! 5 bucks!
Asked and answered.
Okay, that's it! Everybody out. Game's over.
Can I have your chair for a second?
Hey! Look up here! Mom's here. Party's over.
Door's open. Out you go. Go on. Shoo!
You guys have pulled a lot of stupid stunts.
But this?
This?
Risking our liquor license, our livelihood?
Who's going to find out?
I mean, we've been running
this game for a month, and nobody--
Unbelievable. You guys are grounded for two weeks.
But we have mecoming.
Yeah, yeah! keep complaining.
I'd love to make it a year.
Now clean this place up. Now!
Wow. That was fantastic.
Amazing.
Whew. You were incredible.
So were you.
Oh. And...
Time to go.
Susan?
So it's been, what, four months?
Are you ever gonna let me spend the night?
I don't know. Come on, zippy, zippy.
Okay. It's just, you know...
Girls usually beg me to spend the night.
Well, good, then you
shouldn't have any problem
Finding a place to sleep.
Fine. I know the drill.
I can't spend the night.
I can't meet your friends.
I can't meet your son.
I'm just wondering--
Is this ever gonna turn into something normal?
You know, you're a guy,
And we just had hot sex,
And I didn't force you to cuddle.
So run! Go! Brag to your friends.
Look...
I like you, and I know you like me.
So why can't we be a couple?
'cause I'm... Not ready for that.
And what we've got- that's all I can handle.
Go.
Okay, but that's only gonna work, like,
500 or 600 more times.
Good evening. Can I help you?
Wrong question. The question is, can I help you?
Look, if you're trying to sell me something,
I don't have any money.
You do now.
I don't understand.
I'm here to buy you out of your lease.
What?
I know. It's sudden.
But there's something about this house that...
Well, it just feels like home to me.
So I'd like to move in... Tonight.
Tonight? Areou crazy?
A little bit.
Okay, here.
I will more than cover
your moving expenses.
Look, uh... I-i'm all set up here.
Besides, my landlady would never allow it.
Why don't you let me worry about her?
Mm, no. I-i don't have
anywhere else to go.
I think you should leave.
Look, Raymond...
How do you know my name?
I made you a very generous offer,
And I just know you're going to
make the right decision.
Five.
Five what? What are you talking about?
Four.
Are you- I don't understand.
Three. O-okay. Hang on for a second.
Two.
Well, Raymond, thank you very much.
Here you go. Take care.
All taken care of... Mrs. Williams.
Thank you... Mr. Williams.
The next morning,
Edie Britt decided to announce
her return to Wisteria Lane
In a way... That was guaranteed...
To make a big splash.
Okay, you're not gonna believe this, but...
She's back.
Edie? Is that really you?
You know someone else my
age with a body like this?
So you're back?
What happened to your tenant?
He, uh, came into some
money and decided to move.
We thought, what the heck? Let's move back!
"we"?
Oh, you don't know. I have a husband now.
Really? Whose?
So I'm in vegas talking to
this real estate convention.
I do a little motivational speaking.
And there- sixth row, center aisle,
Is the most beautiful woman I have ever seen.
So after I finish,
I walk into the audience
and I ask this goddess out.
His seminar was called "getting what you want,"
And he did...
Three times. Hmm. Before dinner.
Well, it's certainly nice to meet you, Dave,
And let us be the first
to welcome you to Wisteria Lane.
Oh, you know what?
We should have a dinner or something.
Oh, let's make it a party.
We could do it at my restaurant. We'd be honored
Thank you.
So, Gaby, I have to ask.
What the hell happened to you?
I mean, look at you.
Your--your clothes, your--your hair.
Carlos might be blind,
but the rest of us aren't. I had two children.
For what? Breakfast?
Edie? On your first day
back in the neighborhood?
You're right.
I'm sorry, Gaby.
It was rude and insensitive,
and it won't happen again.
Really?
Are you okay.
Now shouldn't we offer
your friends something to eat?
Ooh! I baked some muffins.
Please don't take this the wrong way, but...
We love you.
Mijita! Lunch is ready.
Go get your sister.
Carlos, what's with all the cheese?
You know how Juanita feels
about brussels sprouts.
I'm just trying to make
vegetables more fun. Well, next time,
Give her a carrot and put
her on a roller coaster.
Have you tried to lift her lately?
I know she's gotten chubby.
She'll grow out of it
Ha! We can only hope
With your d.N.A. Running through her veins.
Hey, I do not have fat D.N.A.
Oh, don't make me pull out
the Solis family photo bum.
It's like a bunch of sea lions posing on a rock.
Well, I'm sorry my relatives
don't measure up to
Thgroup of stick-thin drunks
that you come from.
All I'm sang is that our
daughter has a weight problem,
And the sooner we admit it,
the better. She's only 4.
But, you know, you want her
to develop a weight problem?
Go ahead. Nag, criticize,
make her feel self-conscious.
See what happens.
And obviously I am not
getting through to the twins,
Because no Matter what I say,
they keep pulling this crap,
And I am sick of it. Honey, could you...
Sorry.
Yeah.  So you- you want me to talk to them?
You have to. I am tired
of being the bad cop.
You walk the beat for a while.
Fine. You know, boys this age,
They're more likely to
listen to their dads anyway.
I-i can handle this.
I really appreciate it.
Honey, you know what I'd appreciate? Could you...
Sorry.
So kirby has aces in the hole... Yeah.
Whicmeans that Bobby
Will have to wear a dress to
school on monday. Oh! Oh, my! Okay.
You've got to get a picture of that!
Tom? Can I talk to you a sec?
Yeah.
Don't you think
You were kind of sending
the wrong message in there?
I know we don't approve of what they did,
But you--you gotta admit.
Come on. Starting their own
casino is kind of creative.
Yeah? "creative" like selling fake I.D.S was creative.
And hot-wiring Mccluskey's car- that was a work of art.
Honey, honey, this is nothing like that.
I mean, look, the whole school
Is talking about their card game.
Do you realize it was, like,
The place to be on a monday night?
Oh, my god.
What?
You think they're cool.
Well... Yeah.
No, I mean you think they're cool
In that you wanna be them. Oh, please.
You do! This is Tom, former high school Nerd,
Living vicarusly through his awesome-ass kids.
Hey, I was plenty cool in high school.
Are we redefining "cool"
To include playing trombone in the marching band?
You're overreacting.
You're a little high-spirited, but I trust them.
So I've decided to unground
them for the homecoming dance.
But I told them they couldn't go.
And you told me to handle it, and I just did.
Oh, by the way, it wasn't a trombone.
It was a tuba.
know your brass.
Juanita!
You said I could have cake.
I know, but so much?
You could've gone back for a second piece.
This is my second piece.
And it's not Juanita's fault.
In this kind of situation,
I blame the parents.
Look, my kid would eat sugar
all day long if I let her.
Gaby's obviously one of those
moms who just can't say no.
It's a shame, too. Juanita
has such a pretty face.
I'm back.
You want something cold?
Well, actually,
I'm in the mood for something hot.
You know...
This is why it's taking four months
To get my house painted.
Haven't you ever heard that expression,
"you can have it done fast,
or you can have it done right"?
I think I'll have it done right now.
Hey, Susan?
Mm. Uh, Lynette, it's not really a good time.
I just need five seconds
to bitch about Tom,
And then I'll- oh, my god.
Your painter isn't done yet?
Yeah. He--he's hard to keep track of.
Well, anyway, Tom refuses to acknowledge
That the twins are turning
into juvenile delinquents.
Just the other day, I was- oh,
you poor thing! You need a hug.
Have you been drinking?
Sorry to have barged in,
And thanks for letting me
get that off my chest.
Hey, anytime that you need to talk,
you just ring my bell...
And wait.
Okay, new rule.
From now on, sex only happens
in the bedroom, door closed,
Between the hours of 7:00 and 10:00 p.M.
You know what?
It'd be a hell of a lot easier
for me to follow the rules
If I knew why they existed.
I just don't want my friends to know.
Why? You--you ashamed of me?
No, of course not.
It's just... Complicated.
I'm just a simple guy,
So I can't be your dirty little secret.
I need more from you.
I'm sorry. I can't give that to you.
Honey, I know you wanna go
home and watch your cartoons,
But you had a lot of cake,
So I was thinking I'd take you to the park.
That way, you could run around
and get some nice, fun exercise.
No.
You sure?
Running around in the sun and fresh air
Would make you feel good.
Mm... No.
Okay.
Why don't you go throw that in the trash?
And I'm gonna get the car started.
He Juanita.
You wanna play a new game on the way home?
Winner gets a new doll. Okay.
Well, come on, then!
Mommy, what are you doing?
It's a new game I invented,
and you're winning 1 to nothing!
katherine! Fantastic news.
"what's cookin' Fairview?"
Is sending out a camera crew Tomorrow
To do a piece on me and the book.
Oh, which I just finished this morning.
You read it ready? Yes.
I couldn't put it down.
But I have to tell you,
at least a dozen recipes
Are missing a pretty crucial ingredient.
Really?
What?
My name.
Excuse me? Bree, your book
is filled with recipes
That we developed together,
And--and some of them are
flat-out mine. Oh, don't be silly.
I May have based a few on your recipes,
But I ways changed someing.
Like what? The font?
Name one difference between
this meatloaf recipe and mine.
Well, yours calls for
minced curly leaf parsley.
Mine calls for minced flat leaf.
It's minced! Who can tell the difference?
Bree, you have recipes
in here you can't even make.
Never heard anything so absurd.
The croquembouche cake
with the spun sugar netting?
I've never once seen you
work with molten sugar.
I always make that cake. Really, katherine.
Just because I let you
execute a few eye-catching garnishes
That gratify your need to show off,
Doesn't mean that I can't do
them just as well myself.
You let me?
I thought we were partners.
We are.
That's why your name is on the dedication page.
You were right about the dedication, Bree.
It really was the least you could do.
18 to zero!
2 more points, and you'll break the record.
Mommy, I'm tired!
Really?
Well, I thought running
through that guy's sprinkler
Would've refreshed you. Now come on!
No.
Looks like mommy's gonna
score her first 2 points.
Come on, Juanita.
Show mommy what a winner you are.
Juanita!
What are you doing?!
Juanita, stop!
Juanita! Juanita!
And while I thought
Grounding you was an
appropriate punishment,
Your dad convinced me
I was being a little too
hard on you guys. Absolutely.
And so we have decided
To let you go to the homecoming dance tonight...
That's right!
In your father's convertible.
Um, um, h-h-hold on. What? Wh--
Come on, Tom. I mean, we trust them, right?
Yes, yes.
I-i would trust them more if they
Were driving your car. No! You don't wan
Two cool kids pulling up to
homecoming in a mom car,
Especially with that big
dent they put in it last month.
Dude! Thanks! Thanks!
Don't thank me. Thank your father. Thanks, dad!
You rock! Uh, you--whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Here--some ground rules.
N-no muddy shoes on my floor mats. No--
Tom, relax!
You high-spirited kids do
whatever it takes to have fun.
And in three, two, one.
Welcome back to "what's cookin' Fairview?"
We're talking with Bree Van De kamp,
Fairview's premier caterer,
Who's about to publish
her very first cookbook.
Bree, could you show us inside?
This is my kitchen,
And this is my staff--
The most gifted, hardworking team
A cook could ever have hoped for.
I cannot say enough
good things about them.
So which one of you has
worked with Bree the longest?
That would be me.
So tell me, what's it really
like working with Bree?
It's inspiring.
There is absolutely nothing she can't do.
katherine, I'm blushing.
Working with her has been...
Such an education
That i--aah!
Ah! Oh, god. Are you all right?
I think I strained my wrist. God, it hurts.
Oh, you poor dear. Could someone
please get some ice? Oh, no.
Oh, and I was just about to
put the spun sugar netting
On our famous croquembouche.
Would you mind doing it?
katherine,
I'm sure your wrist is just fine.
No, it's really throbbing.
Okay, it looks like Bree to the rescue.
Be sure you get this.
Really something to see.
The secret to spinning sugar
Is this special whisk
That makes lovely gossamer threads.
Careful, dear.
You're clumping. I can see that.
That stuff's hot!
Sorry.
Oops!
So that's your idea of exercise?
Having her run after a car?
Carlos, our daughter sucked
down half a sheet cake,
And afterwards, no one could find the candles.
Wake up! We have got a problem!
I just don't think the
solution is to humiliate her.
Now even if she's... Heavy,
Doesn't she have the right
to feel good about herself?
Hey, I'm protecting her.
She doesn't know the truth yet.
Women only have five seconds
to be young d beautiful,
And then it's gone.
And then before you know it,
we're old and fat and married
And wondering where our beauty went.
Gaby...
No, Carlos. I mean...
Sometimes I'm glad you can't see me.
Five years and two kids
And no time for facials or the gym.
It just... Takes a toll.
And when Edie same the other day,
It was like she didn't even recognize me.
Listen to me.
Nobody knows your face better than I do.
And I see it every time I kiss you.
In 5 years or 50,
You will ways be beautiful.
Hear me?
And now to finish,
You simply transfer your spun sugar
To the croquembouche
And gracefully drape it around
In a delicate swirl.
Did I meion that you...
Probably shouldn't be wearing jewelry
While working with spun sugar? Um...
Well, there's no law that
says it has to be a delicate veil.
I mean, it could really
just be a beautiful, um,
Little, uh, white...
Ribbon.
Turn off the damn camera.
Ah, actually, my wrist is
feeling a little better.
Why don't I give it a shot?
Whatcha doing?
Okay, where are they? It's 30 minutes past curfew.
Actually, it's 32.
If there is a single
scratch on that car--
I mean, after all the time that
I spent restoring that thing...
Yeah. Remember when you spent
the entire day on the internet
Trying to find a new gearshift knob?
Worst anniversary ever.
I cannot believe that you did this to me.
I know.
That car is your baby.
If only there was something
I felt that intensely about.
Oh, wait! There is- my actual babies.
You think I don't care about our boys?
I know you love them,
But sometimes you find
them so cool and entertaining,
You forget to parent them.
Lynette- no, listen.
This is important.
When they were little and they'd act out,
And we'd ways say, "relax! They're young.
When they're older, they'll get it."
Well, Tom, they're 16 now.
Not getting it.
We have a lot of work to
do in a very short time,
And if you and I aren't in sync,
I'm afraid it's not gonna happen.
Hey, sorry we're late.
Yeah. But, dad, you have to hear this story.
We just pulled up at an intersection,
And there were these two hot girls--
I don't want to hear it.
You ever hear of a thing called a cell phone?
We're only, like, 35 minutes late.
Yeah, 35 minutes, during which time
Your mother and I have been worried ck.
But, dad--
You broke the rules. There are consequences.
You're both grounded for a month.
This sucks! You're only doing this
'cause you were worried about your precious car.
You think? Get out of the way.
Any other opinions you'd like to share?
Thank you.
But you didn't have to...
That mirror was scratched.
I ready ordered a new one.
Mrs. Mccluskey! You're still ive!
Oh, it's nice to see you, too, Edie.
This is my husband, Dave Williams.
So how did you two meet?
You run a free clinic or something?
I'm sorry. Who are you? karen Mccluskey,
Edie's best friend on the street.
Well, it's a real pleasure to meet you.
What are you doing here?
Um, I just need to talk to you.
Not here. Go home. I'll call you.
When?
I don't know. Later. Just go.
I have to say, ladies,
This is quite a shindig.
Oh, I'm glad you're
enjoying yourself.
Yeah, I mean, there's
really not a lot of people
Who go to this much trouble
to say they're sorry. Excuse me?
Well, the party. It's just
a beautiful way to apologize.
Edie, this is not a "we're sorry" party.
This is a "we forgive you" party.
You forgive me?
Well, I think what Gaby means is
You were fairly awful to
us right before you left,
And this is our way of welcoming you back
To hopefully not do it again.
You gotta be kidding.
You froze me out.
You threatened to ruin my business,
And you ran me out of town.
Now it's taken me five
years to stop hating you.
Great party, ladies.
Thank you very much.
Now... Mind if I steal my wife?
Sweetheart?
Isn't that your painter?
Is it? I can't tell.
Ooh! Excuse me. It's okay.
Didn't they pay the bill?
All right. Calm down.
I'll take care of it.
You, come with me.
Why would you humiliate
me in front of my friends?
Are you a lunatic?
I-i'm just trying to get through to you.
And, yeah, it's making me kinda crazy.
Susan... Why can't I meet your friends?
I mean, am I really that horrible?
No, of course not.
My friends would love you.
Then what is the problem?
The problem is,
If you meet my friends,
then we're in a relationship,
And I can't be in
a relationship right now.
But i-i promise,
I'll make you very happy.
Well, Maybe I don't deserve to be happy.
A few years ago...
There was this car accident...
A bad one.
Take the high road?
Did you hear what those
smug bitches said to me?
Edie, it's important these people like us.
It's our home now.
I never should've let you
talk me into moving back here.
Why? Why were you so
gung ho on Wisteria Lane?
Listen to your husband. We can be happy here,
But we need these people to like us.
Why?
It'll just make everything easier.
That was an accident.
Susan, you can't feel guilty about it.
You know what, Jackson?
You're not gonna say anything
I haven't ready heard a million times.
I-i only told you because i...
I just want you to understand
Why I can't let you in my life.
Well...
Do you mind if I hang out
for the next few months
And see if you change your mind?
Yeah, I guess I could handle that.
Well, why don't you...
Go have fun with your friends?
And just call me when you're free.
Okay.
Please, Danielle.
You have no right to take him.
I have every right. He's my kid.
Danielle, we agreed I would raise him.
We agreed it would be best!
You said it would be best!
I've had no say in anything!
But I am married now,
and Leo's a lawyer.
So do yourself a favor and
don't try to fight this!
Please, Danielle,
we can have any arrangement you like.
Please, just don't take him!
For god sakes, Orson's gone.
You kids are grown.
Benjamin's all I have!
You're just gonna
have tfind something else.
Honey, come to bed. It's after 2:00.
The cooking show agreed to redo my segment.
I wanna make sure it's perfect this time.
Well, I won't tell you how
to run your business.
It's your baby.
Yes, it is.
Hey. Um, m.J. Ready?
Yeah, he's upstairs waiting for you.
I told you the brakes were squeaking.
I asked you to get them checked.
And I checked 'em!
I meant a mechanic...
Not you. It was not the brakes, Susan.
If it had been, it wouldn't have Mattered.
They crashed into us! And we killed them, Mike!
We didn't kill them! They died.
They were a mother and a child.
She was a mother, just like me...
With a child just like ours.
And if it weren't for us,
they would still be ive.
Yeah, we have been
over and over this, Susan.
It's--it's like you want to suffer.
It's like you don't care at all,
Like you feel nothing for those people.
I can't do this again! I just can't!
Hey. Did you pack your dinosaur book
So you can read it with your daddy? Sure did.
Oh, good. Mmm.
Okay, you have fun, sweetie.
So, um, I'll probably bring him
back sunday around 6:00 or so.
Fine.
Well, have a good weekend.
Doing anything special?
Well, I've sort of starteseeing someone.
So I might do something with him.
Good for you.
It goes by so quickly.
In a flash,
The life we knew is gone forever.
And we're left to ask ourselves...
How could he have left me?
When did my beauty start to fade?
Why has my friend changed?
Was I the best mother I could have been?
Of course, there are some people
Who understand how quickly time passes.
That's why they're so determined
To get what they want
Before it's too late.
Oh, dr. Heller. I've been meaning to call you.
Yeah, I was getting concerned.
You're required to check in once a month.
It was a condition of your release.
Oh, come on. That was a year ago.
But to be honest, the meds are working so well,
I kinda forgot about you. No offense.
Dave, once a month. Not optional.
Message received, doc.
But seriously, you don't
need to worry about me. I'm great.
I'll talk to you in a month.
Just tell me.
What are the magic words
that I've gotta say
So you will let me out of here?
Dave, you've been here six weeks,
And you don't seem any closer
To coming to terms with your rage.
I've come to terms with it,
And I like it just the way it is.
The charges were dropped because you agreed
To put yourself in a doctor's care.
I'm not going to authorize your release
Until I see some real progress.
Wh-what's progress supposed
to look like to you, doc?
I mean, should I just plaster some fake smile on my face
And pretend this--this thing that's inside me
Isn't eatin' me ive?
'cause I can do that if you want.
I need to make sure
You're not a danger to yourself or to others.
Listen, I've never been a danger to myself.
And as far as the others are concerned,
There's only one person who should be worried.
Previously on...
Lives change in five years.
Some families grow,
while others grow apart.
So I thought I'd bring him back
sunday around 6:00 or so. Fine.
And we find ways... it's
not really a good time.
To ease the pain.
Yes, in five years...
Edie, is that really
you? I have a husband now.
Many things change.
You're required to
check in once a month.
It was a condition of your release.
All in all,
Susan mayer's boyfriend knew
he had a lot goingor him.
He was romantic...
Had a nice smile...
And was consistently thoughtful.
Yes, Jackson braddock had
many wonderful attributes.
Sadly...
A sense of timing wasn't one of them.
Hello.
Can I help you?
I guess you could
tell Susan I'm here.
Okay. Uh... who are you?
Oh, I'm Mike... the ex-Husband.
I, uh, I take it you're...
Jackson.
I'm, uh...
Susan's, uh...
Friend?
Friend. That's right.
Wow. Could this be any more awkward?
Well, your robe's open... so yeah.
Well, you be the judge.
I don't know, man.
It-It's pretty good.
Well, I got the feeling that...
Hey, your ex-Husband is...
Mike! Uh, what's going on?
I was just returning
m. J.'S video game.
He left it at my house.
Oh. Thanks. So I
guess you met Jackson.
Yeah. Nice legs.
Oh, clearly this is not
How I would've wanted
the two of you to meet.
He's-He's
really a nice guy.
Yeah, well, just to
make sure, I'm gonna need
To hang with him a
little bit, check him out.
Oh, I don't know
that that's necessary.
If he's sleeping in the
same house as my son,
I think it is.
Oh, well, first off, um, m. J.
Was at a sleepover last night.
And, in fact, Jackson
and he haven't even met,
So, uh, there's really no
need for you to be hanging...
Or checking.
Oh, just... tell Jackson I'll
pick him up here tomorrow night.
Hey, hold on.
You don't get to just decide
these things by yourself.
You remember how nice I was
about our custody agreement?
I can haul you back to court tomorrow
If I'm not 100% satisfied
with who you expose my son to.
Got it?
Uh, I'm sorry.
It's so not how I wanted to
meet your ex for the first time.
Well, when you meet
him for the second time,
You can tell him that.
He's picking you up here
tomorrow night. What?
I'll explain over breakfast.
Did you get the paper?
And that is w Jackson
braddock realized
He needed better timing...
Who are you?
And a longer robe.
If there is one thing everyone in
suburbia can appreciate... oh, hey!
It's a good neighbor.
You know, the kind that helps
With the last bag of groceries...
Or brings over misplaced mail...
Or offers to mow your lawn.
Yes, everyone appreciates
a good neighbor.
You are so sweet to do this.
I just know how tricky
these bulbs can be.
And no one knew this
bette than dave williams,
Who was determined to be
The best neighbor steria
lane had ever seen...
Assuming, of course,
His wife didn't get in the way.
What's going on?
Packing our bags.
Karen mccluskey insulted me again,
And I can't put up with it anymore.
All right, what did she
say to you this time?
Nothing. It doesn't matter. We are
moving. Adults don't pack up and move
Because of some
good-Natured teasing.
She said that my breasts were
a triumph oferman engineering.
You call that good-Natured?
Come on. She's a cranky old lady.
It's not just her. It's all of them.
I mean, it's been five
years. I have changed.
But the people on
this street don't care.
To them, I will always be a joke.
I'm sorry you had a bad day.
Please don't use your
motivational voice.
I really hate that.
You're upset and you're tired.
Why don't you take a nice hot shower,
And I'll makus some lunch?
Does that sound good?
I just never understood it.
We-We could've gone and lived
in any city in this country.
Why did you insist on living here?
'Cause we can be happy here.
You just need to give it some time.
And I promise,
I'll personally see to it
That people start treating
you with a little more respect.
You didn't answer my question.
Didn't I?
Carlos, we got invited to
michelle downing's party!
I'm gonna have to buy
something nice to-Aah!
Gaby, I'm giving a massage.
I can see that.
I can see a
lot of things-
Things that can never be unseen.
Uh, sorry. I guess the
towel must've rode up.
Carlos? Kitchen. Now.
I know you don't like
it when I work down here,
But he couldn't get up the stairs.
He's got a bum hip. He's
also missing a testicle.
Carlos, how much more of
this am I supposed to take?
Okay, okay, maybe I could
set up my table in the garage.
No! That's only part of the problem.
Have you checked our
bank balance lately?
Gaby, I am not taking
the country club job.
Why not? You'd be
massaging rich people.
They tip better and they tend to
Flake less. Yeah, but
I like working here
I get to spend lots of
time with you and the kids.
Carlos, I don't need to
spend lots of time with you.
And frankly, the kids
are on the fence. Gaby!
Bottom line, I miss our
life. I miss shopping.
All I have to look forward to
Is the occasional
invitation to a fancy party.
And I can't even afford
a dress to go to it.
Carlos, please, I am begging you.
Fine. I'll I will take the job.
Thank you.
Sorry.
Ah, no.
Unh-Unh. Come on.
I really don't think Mike's
gonna care what shirt I wear.
Well, I do.
We need a shirt that says,
"I'm a responsible citizen, "
Not "my favorite clothing
store also sells bongs. "
Are you dissing my sense of style?
Absolutely.
Put this on.
Now...
Let's talk about acceptable
topics of conversation.
You like sports, right?
Yeah. I'm a huge socr
fan. No, you're not.
You like football-
American football.
Specifically the colts. Okay.
And here are some other
things you can talk about-
Cars, barbue, fishing.
How about fire? Mike like talk fire?
Jackson, please take this seriously.
I am. I'm just-I'm not gonna
pretend to be somebody I'm not.
If he doesn't like
me, wh's he gonna do?
He could take me to court,
And the judge can make me
choose between you and my son.
And I'm sorry. You will lose.
Peyton manning
Is the greatest
quarterback who ever lived.
Thank you.
Now go shave. You look like a hobo.
Got a sec?
Not really.
So I assume you know about
what happened to jimmy conrado.
I guess.
Your friend gets busted
for dealing drugs at school,
And all you have to
say is, "I guess"?
He's not my friend.
What are you talking about?
You were on the same
little league team.
Yeah, like a million
years ago. Anything else?
No.
Not really.
Parker.
Can I ask you something,
just between us?
Does porter hang out
with jimmy conrado?
I don't know. I could check out his
Friends list on
silverfizz. His what on what
It's like myspace.
You have a web page.
It shows your hobbies,
your favorite music,
And you can talk to people.
Really? Can anyone talk to him?
Yeah. He just has to invite you.
And, uh...
How would somebody make that happen?
Now it's just a mock-Up,
But this is what the book
is going to look like.
Mom, that's fantastic.
Good call on the font.
Thank you, dear.
Orson, what do you think?
Well, I think it's strange
To see my wife billed
as "mrs. Van de kamp. "
Well, you knew what
the book was gonna be
Called. Yes, but it's
differen actually seeing it
I mean, is it too late
to go with "mrs. Hodge"?
My company, which I formed
when we were separated,
Is called mrs. Van
de kamp's catering.
It's how I'm known. Oh, in fairview.
But this book will be national.
I mean, it's your chance
to rebrand yourself.
Is there something
wrong with "Hodge"?
I think I just heard the
milk go bad. I should check.
Orson, I adore you,
But your name... our
name It has no music.
"Van de kamp" trips off the tongue.
"Hodge" sounds like the
noise a plunger makes.
That's preposterous.
Listen...
Van de kamp.
Hodge.
Also, she's got a radio
interview wednesday,
And they're already promoting
her as mrs. Van de kamp.
See? The ship has already sailed.
Oh, don't be hurt. It's
my professional name.
In this house, I will
always be mrs. Hodge.
Now... would it help if mrs. Hodge
Cooked you your favorite
pot roast tonight?
Yes, I guess it would help.
Uh, meeting with your publicist?
Oh, right. Um,
tomorrow for sure, then.
Van de kamp. Hmm.
Hodge.
Here you go. Oh, thank you.
Toby, get off my
chair. You know better.
So what's on your mind?
It's Edie.
You said something to her yesterday
That hurt her feelings.
That thing about her breasts?
Come on. That was a joke.
Perhaps, but it upset her so much
That she suggested we
leave wisteria lane.
I can't have that, mrs. M.
Hey, this is what Edie and
I do. We tease each other.
I say she's easier to get
into than community college.
She says my face looks like a knee.
It's fun.
Still... I would consider
it a personal favor
If you'd apologize to her.
You know, make her
feel accepted and loved.
No.
No?
If Edie wants to change the
way we talk to each other,
She's gotta ask me personally.
And I think you've got a lot of gall
Making me feel like
I did something wrong
When you don't even know me.
Oh... I know you,
Better than you think.
Oh, really?
For starters,
You talk to your cat
like it's a person.
When I knocked on your door,
you immediately invited me in.
Doesn't take a genius to
see that you're lonely.
I'm thinking you had people
in your life at one time...
People who cared about you.
But somethg happened to them.
Some probably died. The rest, well...
They just don't come
around much anymore.
Why do you think that is?
I know you, mrs. Mccluskey.
And it seems to me
That a woman le you
would like to keep
The few friends that she has left.
I think you'd better go.
Thanks for tonight.
And, uh, before I
forget, the colts suck.
Oh, here's what sucks-
Watching a zero-Zero game
With no cheerleaders, soccer boy.
You guys were insulting each other.
That's good, right?
Yeah, we had a blast
Really? Yeah.
In fact, we're getting together
wednesday night at o'brien's,
Which he claims has the best
bacon potato skins in town.
Potato skins at o'brien's?
You've made his inner circle!
This is fantastic!
Thank you. Mmm. Mmm.
Ah, you can think of
A more creative way
to thank me than that.
Nice.
Yeah?
Yeah. Mmm.
You've never done that before.
Wait.
You've never done that before.
Why are you doing that now?
I don't know. Don't you like it?
Yeah. But how did you
know I would like it?
Oh, my God.
What?
Mike told you about the
ear thing, didn't he?
No.
So you just happened
To stumble across my secret turn-On
The same night that you
and Mike became b. F.F.S?
But aren't we losing sight
of the fact that you like it?
This is... I mean, I'm just...
I have been violated.
Oh, honey,
come on-
Don't touch me! Or my ears!
My ears are dead to you.
It just slipped out. We were
talking about how girls-
They-They all like
different things, right?
And I-I was talking about
this girl in high school,
How she liked to do
it with her shoes on,
And-And Mike talked about the
lobe nibble. He has a name for it?
Okay.
That's it. You and Mike
are not hanging out anymore.
And this little
Wednesday "potato skins
and Susan sex tips night"?
I forbid it.
Did Mike mention he likes
having his toes sucked?
Oops! That just slipped out. Hmm.
Gaby...
Bree! What's up?
Well, um, michelle downing
asked me to speak to you.
I don't know if you heard,
But I'm catering her
birthday party I
Heard. I can't wait.
Ooh, I was gonna ask you
Should I wear the navy blue chanel
Or the red sleeveless
dress? You can't come.
Sorry.
I just had to rip the band-Aid off.
What? She's disinviting me?
It's not personal.
You know how Carlos
just started at the club?
Well, her guests are all members,
And she thinks they
might find it awkward
Socializing with...
Staff.
She called us "staff"?
Oh, Gaby, it's just one
party. I'll save you some cake.
No! It's not just one party!
It's the kickoff to
the whole social season.
If people see we're
off michelle's list,
Then we'll be off everyone's.
And then it's gonna be
the start of our slow slide
From gowns and galas to
flip-Flops and keggers!
Okay, if Carlos working
at the club is the problem,
Then tell her he just quit.
Oh, hon, I don't
think that's gonna fly.
He's already rubbed too many members.
What's happened to my life?
We used to have help.
Now we are the help!
What are you doing?
I am just...
Talking to porter on silverfizz.
Who is saraj from
macarthur high school?
Me.
I'm 16 and cute.
I like graphic novels and
tokyo police club. Oh, my God.
You-You're pretending
to be somebody else?
Our brooding son has a classmate
Who got arrested for selling drugs.
I really think the end
justifies the means here.
Okay, we'll address your major
ethical breach in a moment.
What did you find out?
Well, the good news is
He really doesn't hang
out with jimmy conrado.
But I am a little
worried about anita47,
Who told him cherry fruit
pops are an aphrodisiac.
Okay, great, you know who
he hangs around with now.
You got what you came
for. Time to stop.
You're probably right. It's just...
Did you know porter writes poetry?
Serious? Yeah.
Our porter,
The kid who communicates
with grunts and shrugs,
Writes this...
Beautiful, heart-Wrenching poetry.
Maybe one day he'll share it with you
Instead of your fantasy alter ego.
Until then, shut it off.
Okay, okay.
You're right.
You're right.
I luvs me some walt whitman!
Emlly dickinson kicks
walt whitman's ass!
Yeah, if you're into spinster poetry.
Oh, really?
Is your girlfrend into poetry, too?
Don't have one. There's a girl I
lile. But we haven't gotten to that yet.
Aw. That's sweet.
Girls love romance. Send her a
poem. She won't know what hit her.
Still talking to poetry girl?
Bite me.
Dude, she didn't put up her photo.
5 bucks says she looks
like she came out of an egg.
Whatever.
Toby?
Toby! Where are you?
Toby!
Everything all right, mrs. M.?
It's toby. I can't find him.
Oh, no. How did he get out?
The living room window
was open, which is bizarre
Because I don't remember opening it.
Can you help me find him?
Have you given any more thought
about apologizing to Edie?
She's still pretty down in the dumps.
I've kind of been busy.
Of course you have. It's just that...
Well, since I'm about to
help you find your cat,
It sure would be nice if you
could help me out with Edie.
Doesn't that seem fair to you?
I guess.
Here.
Thank you.
Okay. Toby!
Toby! Come here, boy!
Toby!
So they'll finish with the
news, do a quick traffic update,
And then we're on the air.
Uh, do you need anything?
No, I'm good. How do I look?
We're on the radio.
Oh. I'm a little bit nervous.
This is my first national interview.
And I am a huge fan
of your cookbooks.
Well, I've heard
good things about you.
I understand you're catering
Michelle downing's
birthday dinner tonight.
Oh, you know michelle?
Yes, and I'll be there.
I can't wait to see what you dish up.
Okay, now I'm terrified.
Here we go.
Good afternoon.
I'm Linda Flanagan, and
this is "gourmet americana. "
If you've been to
fairview's best parties,
Then you've probably tasted
the mouthwatering food
Dished up by my first
guest, Bree Van de Kamp.
Now she's about to
publish her first book,
"Mrs. Van de kamp's
old-Fashioned cooking. "
Welcome, Bree.
Hi, Linda.
Tell me. Why "old-Fashioned"?
Well, I think a lot of people
miss the way life used to be-
Back when women had
more time to cook.
It's always been important to me
To have the family gather
around the table every night
For hot, lovingly prepared meals.
So you're a traditional kinda gal.
Is there a mr. Van de kamp?
No.
Uh, mr. Van de kamp is deceased. Oh.
But in regards to my husband,
I should make one
thing very clear-
His passing had nothing
to do with my cooking.
Is that my yeats book?
I love his poetry.
Yeah. I'm borrowing it for school.
This is the kind of poetry
that melts a girl's heart.
So romantic.
Oh! Here's
a great one-
"The lover tells of
the rose in his heart. "
My first boyfriend gave me this poem.
I was a junior in Mom, I'm-I'm
running late. Can I have the book back?
Oh. Sorry.
Enjoy!
Katherine, it is not too
late to change tonight's menu.
If Linda Flanagan likes my food,
She might give me a
quote for the book jacket.
I have to knock her socks off,
And I am not betting
the farm on haddock.
Argue with me all you like.
I just bought 40 pounds of pork,
so get your tushie over here.
Orson! Did you get my
message about Linda Flanagan?
Yes, I heard.
Isn't it amazing?
Mm. Almost as amazing as
my on-Air death notice.
What?
"So, Bree, do you have a husband?"
"Nope. Used to. He croaked. " She
didn't ask if I had a husband.
She asked if there
was a mr. Van de kamp,
And there's clearly not.
Well, there's a mrhodge.
Would it have killed
you to have mentioned me?
And waste valuable airtime?
The show was about my cookbook,
Not about my tortured
marital history.
That's not what this is about.
It's because I went
to jail, isn't it?
Orson, I have 6 hours to
prepare a meal for 80 people.
We're not having this discussion now.
Just admit it. You're ashamed of me.
Should I be proud?
Do you want me to go
on the radio and boast
That my husband served time
for running someone over?
I went to jail because you told me
It was the only way
you'd take me back.
And because it was
the right thing to do.
I just didn't know then
That I would be a
public figure someday.
But I am. I have a name now.
And luckily for you, it's not mine.
Orson, please don't be hurt.
I am under so much pressure
and so terrified I'll fail
That I don't even know what
I'm saying half the time.
Just let me get through this.
As soon as the plates go out tonight,
I will come home and cook
you that pot roast I promised.
Okay?
Okay. Hmm.
It's just
that... I-
Chives! How could I forget chives?
Hey, Susan, it's me.
Listen, I'm not gonna be
able to make dinner tonight.
My college roommate's in town,
And this is the only
night we can get together.
Oh. Is his name Mike Delfino?
Did you room together
at liars' college?
Um, I know it's last-Minute,
and I'm really sorry,
But I stilwanna see you.
So how about I drop by later?
Call me if that's a problem.
Yeah, you'll drop by later...
With potato skins on your breath,
You miserable two-Timer!
What's wrong, mom?
Nothing.
Just, the answering
machine lied to mommy.
I finally found a poem as beautiful
as you. You're all I think about.
"The lover tells of the rose in
his heart" by william butler yeats.
Oh, crap on things.
Crap on what things?
Porter sent me a sex poem.
What? Why?
He may be in love with me.
Why would he be in love with you?
Okay... remember how you told me
I should stop talking to him online?
Well, of course, I didn't,
And I sort of told
him I liked his poetry.
You told a teenage boy
that you liked his poetry?
Jeez, Lynette! Why not
just flash him a boob?
Shh! He'll hear you. So
what are you gonna do?
Are you gonna tell him the
truth now, or are you gonna
Wait until after he kills
me and blinds himself?
Calm down. I'm gonna
break it off in an e-Mail.
Oh, great. Just like
that? That'll kill him.
I know that you have only
been the receiving end
Of break-up letters, but
I've actually written a few,
And I know how to let him down easy.
"Dear porter,
"I really like you,
But I wanna see other offspring. "
Go away.
You know, I'm kinda surprised
We still made michelle's
list this year,
What with me working at the club.
Oh, don't be silly, Carlos.
We're still on everyone's list.
Now let's go. Okay.
Gaby, are we in the banquet hall?
What's all the noise?
Oh, it's just the caterers
Putting glasses and
silverware on the tables.
They make some racket, huh?
But the decorations are stunning.
Especially that waterfall effect.
Gaby? Bree!
Shouldn't you be in the kitchen?
Don't move, honey. The
press is taking your photo.
What are you doing here? You were
disinvited. I got it all figured out.
We duck inside, make sure we're
seen by all the right people-
Except mrs.
Downing-
And then after about
20 minutes, we cut out.
Well, I know nothing.
Just keep me out of it.
What is carlosoing?
Where is he? Where is who?
Like you don't
know Jackson.
Well, he's not here.
Really? Whose is this?
I... d-I don't
know. Some guy's.
"I... I don't know"?
Well, I hope that "some guy"
Doesn't mind this.
No, Susan, really, I wouldn't...
Lady, what are you doing to my beer?
We're not married anymore,
So I don't have to protect you.
I am... so sorry.
Miss?
Um... could you just...
Please take good care of my friend?
Jackson canceled on me.
He said you weren't
comfortable with us hanging out.
He said that? And I
think I said, "meow. "
I am such a jackass.
So why don't you want us hanging out?
Well, I was pretty ticked off
That you told Jackson
about the ear thing.
Oh, God. The second I said
that, I wished I hadn't.
I I'm really sorry.
Apology accepted.
So if I promise to behave,
can we still hang out?
'Cause I really think
it'd be good for m. J.,
Just seeing that we're all friends.
I don't...
What?
I'm just not comfortable
With you and Jackson
getting that close.
Okay.
It's just...
I don't want him to see
me through your eyes.
How exactly do you think I see you?
Well, those last few months
we were together, I...
The things I said to
you, the way I acted...
I mean, I'm not proud
of the person I became.
That was a bad time, Susan.
We're not those people anymore.
And if you could see
yourself through my eyes,
You'd know you got
nothing to worry about.
Could you please
take care of this guy?
He's my friend, too.
Boy, am I glad to see you.
Where you been?
Out, uh, doing some thinking.
And I've decided that I may
have gone a little overboard
About you and Mike.
In fact, I think it's cool if
you wanna hang out with my ex.
Hey, susie q.!
Just shakin' the dew off the lily.
And speaking of,
That paint job in the
guest can is nice. Kudos.
What are you doing here?
Well, Julie needed me to cosign
some insurance stuff for her,
And I guess I lost track of time
talking to crunchy granola here.
Plumber to housepainter
in one move, susie?
Don't get dizzy climbin'
that social ladder.
Can you leave, please? Just think...
If I'd been a roofer, we might
still be together. Sigh. Get out.
See ya around, hacky sack.
So... any more exes
I should know about?
Don't you just love
michelle's parties?
Oh, they are fun. Mm-Hmm.
But I enjoy my intimate
lunches with michelle even more.
We have intimate lunches. We're
friends. Well, you simply must come
To the charity auction at
ted's gallery next weekend.
Really? We'd love to.
Gaby!
Well, it's the caterer!
Everything is fabulous.
But would you be a dear and get me
some more wine? I would be happy to.
I just want to make sure
it's the kind you like.
You're still here?
Dinner is about to be served.
Whose seats are you in? The bowmans.
I found out mrs. Bowman is
home with the flu. Score!
Oh, will you unclench? It'll be fine.
No, no, no, no, no. These are
my seats. This is my mother.
That was mr. Bowman, wasn't it?
Yes, and I'm pretty sure
That elderly woman
with him was his mother!
What kind of man leaves
his sick wife at home
To go party with mommy?!
You can fix this.
Just tell them that
you're at the wrong tabl
And then slip out
the side door. Right.
Yes, sir, he has absolutely no-
That was the matre d', wasn't it?
Yes, and he appears to be checking
the guest list. Which we're not on.
Okay, you can fix this.
Just explain you're
going to a different party
Here at the club and
that you got confused.
Mrs. Downing never
has to know. Right.
You need to leave! Out.
That's mrs. Downing.
How am I gonna fix this?
At this point, I would just run
off screaming into the night.
Thank you. Mm-Hmm.
Get your hands off me.
Gaby! Gaby!
Poor blind bastard.
I'll meet him outside.
What? Hi, Edie.
I just wanted to say I feel
awful about what I said to you.
You know, that crack
I made the other day?
Okay.
That's nice of you.
Are you all right?
Actually, no. My cat's missing.
Toby? Mm-Hmm.
Since when? It's been two days,
and he's never been out this long.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
I'm sure he's fine.
Yeah. Well...
Could you tell dave...
Tell him I apologized? And,
uh, you and I are good, huh?
I guess I could.
Why do you want him-
Oh, just tell him, please.
I cannot believe you
pulled a stunt like that.
What?
I was just trying to salvage
what's left of our social life.
Now just let it go
And start thinking about
where we're gonna move.
This is not a joke, Gaby.
I work with these people.
I have to show my face
tomorrow. It's humiliating.
You wanna know what's humiliating?
Waking up one day
And finding out you're invisible.
Now it's official.
I've lost everything.
Everything?
First our money, then my figure,
Now the last shreds
of our social standing.
We haven't lost a thing
Except the chance to hobnob
with a bunch of unhappy snobs.
What do you mean, they're unhappy?
They're rich! They
have jewels and cooks.
They use "winter" as a verb.
I rub them, Gaby,
And there is nothing
That a blind masseur
doesn't hear about.
Trust me.
They are every bit
as miserable as I was
When I was out there
chasing that stuff.
We have lost nothing that matters.
We have a home, we have each other,
We have work that supports us,
And we have two beautiful
little girls that...
Love us more than ice cream.
I've never been happier in my life.
Are you serious?
Yes,
And the only thing that
would make me happier
Is for you to realize
how good we've got it.
"I have never talked
to such a wonderful guy,
But I should've told you I'm
already seeing somebody... "
Blah, blah, blah...
"Continue to trust your heart,
and your dreams will follow. "
Wow, Lynette.
Best dear john letter ever.
Uh... thanks.
Except you might
wanna change that part
Where you signed it "love,
mom. " What? No I didn't.
Yeah, you did...
Right there.
You sent it?!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Why didn't you say something?! I did!
You said it was great.
Way to bury the lead, Tom!
Tom, don't you dare! Hey,
One of needs to live to
take care of the other one
Hey.
Mind if I join you?
Okay, I know what I did...
Was unforgivable.
And I am not trying to make excuses,
But...
We used to talk all the time,
And then one day it just stopped,
And it killed me.
I felt like I lost you.
And then I was saraj,
and I had you back,
And we were talking again,
and you were telling me things.
I wasn't telling you anything.
I was telling her.
Okay.
Well, for what it's worth,
I loved our conversations,
And I'm... going to miss them.
Me, too.
Orson, you're still up.
Oh, I wish you could've been there.
Linda Flanagan loved my food.
She said I was "God's
gift to the table"
And that I could quote
her on the book jacket.
Are you all right?
I'm hungry.
It's after midnight.
Haven't you eaten?
I was waiting for you. You
said you'd make me pot roast.
I am so sorry. I-I
lost all track of time,
And Linda had so many
questions about the food.
I'll make you that pot
roast tomorrow, okay? No.
I want it now.
Now?
You promised.
Orson, I've been cooking all day.
I... I'm so tired,
I can barely stand up.
You really want me to
make you a pot roast now?
You promised.
Toby!
Where in the world
did you come from, huh?
Yes, everyone appreciates
a good neighbor...
You know, the kind that helps
you with the groceries...
But doesn't ask, "why
is your son so moody?"
The type that delivers misplaced mail
But doesn't point out your
wife seems discontented...
The sort that offers
to mow your lawn...
But doesn't mention
your husband seems cold.
But if you're not
sure the man next door
Is as nice as he would
have you believe...
Now why would you bring me flowers?
'Cause you've got a computer,
And I need to find out some
stuff about Edie's husband.
Do everything you can to
get to know him better.

Previously on Desperate Housewives...
Susan's new boyfriend met the family...
Who are you?
Hi
I'm Mike. Her ex-husband.
Gaby's life was no long glamorous.
(Service Entrance Only)
Now it's official. I've lost everything.
First Our mOney, then my figure,
Now the last shreds of our social Standing.
Baby, we have a home, and we have two beautiful little girls...
Danielle's decision was devastating.
Please, just don't take him!
Benjamin's All I have!
You're just gonna have to find something else.
And Edie's new husband showed the dark side.
I would consider it a personal favor
If you'd apologize to Edie.
No.
And it seems to me
That a woman le you would like to keep
The few friends that she has left.
I think you'd better go.
Now why would you bring me flowers?
'cause you've got a computer,
And I need to find out some stuff about Edie's husband.
Benjamin Katz was 6 years old,
And there were a lot of things he didn't understand.
He wasn't sure why the woman you call "mommy"
Isn't Always your mother.
Or how the man who was Always there for him
Could suddenly be taken away.
Or why you could go for a ride...
And never come back home.
Yes, there were a lot of things
Benjamin Katz couldn't understand,
And no one seemed in a hurry
To explain them.
Here they come, finally.
You know, Bree, things will be a little strange at first,
So please, be on your best behavior.
I do not require lectures on tact.
I know. It's just that we've missed Benjy so much,
And it's taken so many olive branches
To get them to come back. I'm aware of what's at stake, Orson.
Good. So if you feel an impulse to criticize something,
You'll keep the thought to yourself.
Hi!
I've Already started.
Danielle! What a dightfully ethnic ensemble.
Hey, mom, Orson. Hi, Danielle.
Oh, I want to meet my husband Leo.
It's nice to finally meet both of you in person. Lovely to meet you, Leo.
Hey, who's this little linebacker?
Hi, Benjy. Remember me? I'm not sure.
That's okay. That's what this visit is for, right?
Getting to know each other.
Now we have you for the whole weekend, right?
Yep, whole three days.
Oh, good. 'cause we've made lots of plans.
We're gonna take you to the circus
If it's okay with your folks. Can I go, Danielle?
"danielle"? Did he just ca you "danielle"?
Well, it is my name.
Yes, I'm aware of that. I picked it.
I'm just concerned
People might view it as a sign of, um, disrespect.
By "people," you mean you?
Uh... Leo. Look at All the luggage you have here.
I'll give you a hand here. Okay. Oh, thanks.
Um... Let me be clear.
I do no want him calling me "bree."
Oh, don't worry. Td him to call you "granny."
Yes, Benjamin Katz was only 6 years old,
But even he could understand
This was going to be...
A long weekend.
Any child will tell you
That where you find a playground,
You will Also find...
Bullies--
Young tyrants who bring pain...
Intimidation...
And violence.
What can children do in the face of such torment?
Well, there is one obvious option,
But not every child is eager to go running home to mother.
Ugh. Hey. Hon.
How was the park? Wait. Hold on.
Mommy just found her first gray hair.
I need you to grab it, yank it and never speak of it again.
Oh. Look at your face.
It's scratched.
What happened?
Nothing.
And your shirt is ripped.
That's the second Time this week.
Is someone picking on you?
Who is it?
Is it Jeffrey Hixon, that weird kid who eats paper?
Is it Timmy Crowley?
His mom slept in her car last night.
Who knows what's going on there?
Is it that boy from your birthday,
The one who slugged the pony?
Oh, sweetie. I know you're upset,
But you'll feel better if you talk about it.
And there's nothing you can't tell me. I'm your mommy.
I wanna talk to daddy.
Okay.
We'll give him a call.
You're not gonna find another one in this condition.
I mean, the car is a classic.
Well, what do you think, Nabila?
Eh. I like it. I don't love it.
Tell you what.
Gaby and I want to find our car a nice home.
So I'm prepared to knock a grand off.
What do you say? I say knock off 5 grand, and we'll talk
Oh, come on. It's Already priced way below blue book,
Not to mention it's mint. This is not mint.
Hey,an you not see this ding in the bumper here?
Okay, this car goes zero to 60 in 5 seconds.
By the Time someone says, "wow, a ding,"
You're in the next county. 4 grand, you got yourself a deal.
Deal.
What? No! No, no deal!
The nondriving blind guy does not speak for me.
Would you excuse us?
Gaby, we've been trying to move this car for a month.
We need the cash.
God,sn't there any way we can keep it?
I mean, this car's the last thing I have
That tells the world, "i'm better than you."
Sorry, babe. We have to pay the mortgage.
We can't afford to be better than anyone.
Here.
Take good care of her.
Actually, it's not for us. It's for our nanny.
Okay, that one hurt.
So what'd you dig up on mr. X.?
You mean Dave? Yeah.
Nothing yet. It's been two days. What gives?
Well, for starters, when I search for "dave Williams,"
I get a million and a half hits.
To narrow it down, I'm gonna need more information,
Like where he was Born, where he went to school.
Did he serve Time in the military? Oh, believe me,
If he served Time, it was in the state pen.
Hey! Dave!
Morning, ladies.
Si bastard. How are you?
Hey, Katherine,
Your sprinkler system working okay now?
Like a charm. And thanks again.
I've never been able to get that to work. Oh, I hear ya.
To program those things, you need an engineering degree.
Oh, yeah? You got one of those?
Anyway... Really appreciate it.
Take care.
I just can't go through with this.
He--he just strikes me as so nice.
That's supposed to comfort me,
Given your track record with men?
Katherine, please.
The guy is bad news.
I can't prove it, but I feel it in my bones.
And I can't sit around doing nothing when I know
That Edie's waking up every morning next to him.
If anyone finds out we're doing this...
No one will know.
And when they do, they'll probably thank us.
Because I'm telling ya, this guy is up to something.
Cleaning out the old garage- my deepest sympathy.
Hey, Dave. You--you settling in okay?
Yeah. Yeah.
Well, they finally delivered my flat screen.
I was dying without it. I mean, it is 65 inches.
Wow. Sweet!
Hey, w--the play-offs are on. You should come check it out.
It's like being right on the field.
Yeah...
Um, Lynette's really busting my hump
About clearing this place out, so...
Well, Maybe later.
The game doesn't start for a couple hours.
We could order one of those giant sandwiches.
Sorry, but, you know, check back with me
Make sure I survive this whole thing. Okay.
Hi, Dave.
Hi.
Hey, Tom?
Yeah?
Why are there two piles?
Well, that's the pile that I'm throwing away,
And, uh, this is the stuff I still need.
You need unopened mountain climbing equipment from 1986?
You don't climb mountains.
Not yet, but someday. I mean, you know... Who knows?
I know. You get winded just climbing out of the tub.
You're never gonna climb a mountain.
You know what else you're never gonna do?
Learn german, make your own beer or...
Have 8 minute abs.
Come on, not the ab-tastic. Toss it, and keep tossing
Until this 2-car garage can hold at least one car.
Please tell me you're not getting rid of your bass.
No point in hanging on to it.
I mean, being in a band is just one more thing I'll never do.
Before he moved, Mike and i,
We used to get together on saturdays and just... Jam.
Man, that was fun.
You know, I play the drums.
Maybe you and I should jam sometime.
I guess we could.
Maybe even later today? Just...
Yeah! Yeah, you know what? Just give me a couple hours.
I gotta stash these old "playboys." I'll see you later.
Now remember, you can't just start grilling Edie,
Or she'll get suspicious. We have to be subtle.
I'll just follow your lead.
Okay.
Sorry I'm late.
What a great idea!
I haven't done this in ages- a fun lunch with the girls.
Yeah, it's fun.
Where was Dave Born?
What?
We were just wondering
Where he got his great... Manners.
He's got that gentle bearing
Of a... Southern gentleman.
No, he's from somewhere in the midwest.
"somewhere"?
You don't know where your husband grew up?
Well, he showed me a picture of his childhood home once.
It had a cow in it. I lost interest.
Honestly, Edie, how can you be married to a guy
And not know these things?
You know what? What?
I think it's Time to order. Where's our waitress?
I'll be right with you, mrs. Mayfair.
Oh, no problem, Debbie. You take your Time.
She is such a sweet girl.
She's saving money for college.
Speaking of which... Where did Dave go to college?
Come on, Debbie! While we're young!
I don't know.
All right. What about high school?
Why are you asking me All these questions?
I just think it's odd that you're married to some guy--
You don't know anything about him.
Other than the fact that he's a lovely man.
He... Fixed my sprinkler.
I don't want to talk about this anymore.
I'm going to the ladies' room.
Well, your subtle approach got us nowhere.
I've been through a lot with this baby.
I hate to sell her, but, you know,
With my new sports car coming, I don't really need it.
Yeah. Here she is.
How's it look?
Be glad you're blind.
We have to be practical.
We just need something to get us from point "a" to point "b."
Now let's buy the thing. Okay, just let me handle this.
So... Do we have a sale?
I don't know, Andrew.
I mean... We like it. We don't love .
Yeah, well, no one buys a car like this and loves it.
It's All about the price. And you're not gonna do better.
Yeah, about that price--
You're gonna have to drop it. I mean, look at All these dents.
Yeah, it's Also missing three hubcaps,
And it's got a hanger for an antenna.
Full disclosure- it's a piece of crap.
You want it or not?
Well, I'll tell you what.
Since your mom and I are dear friends,
I'll take it off your hands if you knock off $300.
And since my mom and you are dear friends,
I'll resist the urge to flip you the bird.
Andrew!
Unless you lower this price, we're walking... Right now.
See ya.
I mean it.
This is it.
Fine.
Fine.
Okay, fine. Knock off $200, and we'll give you cash.
No. $100.
No. Wh--
Will you at least have it washed?
I'll empty the ashtray. Final offer.
Damn you.
You beat me again!
Curse you and your diabolical checkers prowess.
All right, Orson.
Don't overexcite him on the upholstery.
So, Danielle, what would you like me to make as a side dish
For your welcome home party?
I can do anything so long as it complements beef tenderloin.
Actually, we don't eat meat. We're vegetarians.
Excuse me? So is Benjamin.
Oh. Well... Since when?
Since I realized that meat was a byproduct of murder.
Would it be more acceptable
If I shopped for a suicidal pork loin?
Bree, it's no big deal.
I'll just make a nice risotto.
This isn't about dinner.
This is about her nutty liberal politics
Getting in the way of our grandson's nutrition.
He gets All the protein he needs from cheese and beans d tofu.
Well, this isn't just about nutrition.
Do you want him to be teased at school
Every Time he pulls tofu out of his lunchbox?
Actually, that won't be an issue.
Danielle is homeschooling him.
Excuse me?
You're teaching him?
Yes. I take it you have an opinion?
So instead of sending him to a proper school,
You're gonna give him the benefit
Of your straight "c" average? Hey, he's only 6,
And he's Already reading at a third grade level.
Well, what happens next year when he overtakes you?
Uh, Bree... Ahem. Best behavior, remember?
I am sorry, but am I supposed to sit by
While she degrades his body and his mind?
Fine.
Cricize my parenting All you want.
I don't care,
Because you don't get to decide how he's raised anymore.
I'm his mother.
And by the way, Mark your calendars,
'cause seven years from next saturday--
Benjamin's bar mitzvah.
Isn't this cool? Dave brought his drums over so we could jam.
Your boy is pretty good. Yeah,
And we figured out we got bass, we got drums
Mike plays guitar. I think Orson plays keyboards.
You see where I am going with this? I do, but I'm hoping I'm wrong.
We're gonna start a garage band!
And I wasn't! Maybe if we get good enough,
We can even get, like, a couple of gigs.
How fun would that be? "gigs"? Did you just say "gigs"?
Now All's we need is a little Time to practice--
A few nights a week, some weekends.
What? Well, yeah,
Just until we get the rhythm section All diAled in.
Okay, I need to dial you in to some gigs you already have,
Which are running a restaurant, being a husband and a father.
And I thought you were the one who said
You wanted to spend more Time with your family.
But we could play clubs.
I mean, he's just having a little fun, Lynette.
Guys need to blow off steam.
Could you just... For a sec?
Come on. You know I'm right. You're far too busy for this.
You can't just decide for me like that.
I mean, if I wanna play bass,
I will play bass.
I'm not hurting anybody.
Those of us with hearing beg to differ.
Okay, you know what?
Please leave our rehearsal space.
Oh, come on, Tom. This is not your--
Guys, hey, knock it off back there.
Oh, god. What now?
Oh. Hey. What's up?
You sold me a lemon.
That's what's up.
What are you talking about?
Your car!
I took it to a mechanic, who told me the radiator's shot.
Oh. That. Yeah.
It's been giving me trouble for years. Just use the jug.
What jug?
Oh, it's in the trunk. You just keep it full of water,
And when the radiator overheats, you fill it up.
Oh, and, uh, try not going up hills
And stay in the shade as much as possible.
Okay, i-i can't drive around avoiding gravity and the sun.
Well, sorry.
If you want a car with no flaws, buy a new one.
Or I could get the radiator fixed,
Which is gonna cost $300, whichyouare paying for.
Remember full disclosure? Crap?
This is your car. It's your problem.
Okay, you know what? That's it. I wanna talk to your mother.
Uh, well, she's in a meeting right now.
Can I take a message? Damn it, Andrew.
You tell Bree to call me by the end of the day.
May I ask what it's regarding?
All right, we'll talk about it more later, buddy.
Why don't you go on outside and play for a while? Okay.
Well, what did he say? Well, he still won't tell me who's picking on him,
But he did ask me to teach him how to fight.
He's only 5. I don't want him fighting
I'm sorry, b every boy
Has to learn how to throw a punch eventually. Ugh.
You know, if you wanna give him a leg up,
You could teach him a little capoeira. Capo-what?
Oh, it's a brazilian martial art
That incorporates dance.
Yeah, 'cause there's nothing scarier
Than a guy coming at ya with jazz hands. That's funny, but actually,
The dance part's to catch your opponent off guard.
Like that? No, there's a little more nuance to it.
Ooh! Like that.
Where's the "dance" part?
Oh! There it is, ginger!
You know what, boys? Not in the house.
Oh, my god!
Give it back! It's my ball! It's my ball now.
Hey! You leave him Alone.
Oh! Honey!
Is that who's been picking on you? Juanita Solis?
Well, she is going to get a big surprise,
Because your daddy
Is about to turn you into a killing machine.
Uh, m.J., can I talk to your mom for a second?
What?
I can't teach him to hit a girl.
That's not just any girl. You saw her.
She could take down a small deer.
It doesn't Matter.
If it wears a skirt, it's off-limits.
That is sexi.
If feminism means anything, it's that it's okay
For a big, mean girl to get her butt kicked.
You, teach him
One of those brazilian kung fu cha-cha things.
I'm with Mike.
You can't hit girls.
Ah! Couple of wusses.
I'll handle it myself.
Oops! Didn't see that coming.
Just for that, I'm breaking my rule about not hitting girls.
Ga, we have a problem.
I just saw Juanita push m.J. Down.
Really?
Really.
It's not the first Time. Juanita's been bullying him.
Wow. I'm sorry. I'll talk to her.
Thank you.
And don't worry. No one will hear about this from me.
Hear what?
That m.J.'s getting beat up by a little girl.
Well...
A girl.
Are you suggesting
That Juanita is fat for her age?
Gaby, Juanita's fat for your age.
Yeah? Well, let's face it.
M.J. Could get beaten up by a kitten.
You know what?
Maybe you could teach your daughter
How to use her words and not her fists.
Yeah? Or Maybe you could teach your son to grow a pair!
What you looking at?
Oh, just some old pictures.
Can you guess who that little girl is?
That's your mom way back when she was your age.
What's she eating?
Oh! Uh, a hot dog.
No way.
Oh, yes. Your mother loved hot dogs.
Every day at lunchtime, she'd say to me,
"mommy, I want hot dog."
How come she doesn't eat them now?
Well, because she's All grown-up.
You see, hot dogs and hamburgers
Are what make little boys and girls
Grow up to be big and strong.
And now that she's grown-up, she doesn't need them anymore.
Doesn't mommy want me to be big and strong?
I've been asking myself that All day.
Maybe she's afraid if you get big,
You'll leave home and go play for the red sox.
But I want to get big. I want to play baseball.
Oh. Well...
In that case...
Can i?
You have to promise not to tell your mommy.
Okay.
Well, what do you think?
It's like tofu, only better.
Yes.
Yes, it is.
Two three four
When Tom Scavo through himself
Into his new hobby.
His wife told herself
It was a phase, and it would pass quickly.
But three hours later, she realized
It could not pass quickly enough.
So Lynette began to plot
Against her husband's instrument of torture.
Ooh! Careful, honey.
Sorry.
You could break your dad's guitar and...
It was at that moment her daughter
Provided her an idea for a... Simple accident...
And... A clean Alibi.
Damn it!
Hey, is everything All right? Oh, my!
It was lying in the middle of the floor!
How in the world did that happen? Has Penny been playing in here again?
I've told her a million Times!
Now I'm sure it was an accident, Tom. Please don't yell at her.
This was a $1,600 bass.
I can't afford to replace it.
Penny Lynn Scavo!
Where is she?
Oh, Tom!
She's up in her room.
I'm gonna go play outside.
Oh! Wait. Your forgot your whistle.
Okay, sweetie.
This is just to be on the safe side.
If Juanita comes around, you just blow it.
I'll be right there. Okay.
Good boy.
Hey, give me back my whistle!
Juanita Solis, don't you move! You are in big trouble!
What's on your head?
Never mind.
What did you do to m.J.?
He wouldn't let me blow his whistle.
So your solution was to push him down?
Do you think that's nice?
How would you feel if someone did that to you? I wouldn't care.
Oh, really? You don't think it would hurt?
Even if it did...
I'm not a crybaby like m.J.
I'm sorry.
Juanita, I just wanted you to see how it felt.
Are you okay?
Susan, I saw that!
Kids, get inside!
Okay, first off, it wasn't as bad as it looked.
Really? 'cause it looked like you body-slammed my daughter.
I barely tapped her. She was milking it.
That's your defense? You were only assaulting her "a little"?
I was trying to teach her not to be a bully--
Something she should have learned from her mother.
Well, I'm sorry. I was too busy trying to explain to her
Why m.J. Doesn't wear a dress like All the other little girls.
This conversation is over.
Tell BoB and Lee that I'll pay for the dent in their lawn.
You did not!
I did.
You know what?
We've both been incredibly childish here,
And it is Time one of us took the high road,
So I am now going to walk away.
Please take note of this conflict resolution
And try to pass the lesson on to your daughter.
You can dye that hair All you want,
But the gray's just gonna keep coming.
And they call me white trash.
You got a minute? Yeah. Sure. Come on in.
I, uh, I heard there was a little accident.
So...
I got this for Tom.
You bought Tom a new bass?
It's not as smooth as his old one, but it's good.
We can't accept this.
It's mostly selfish on my part. I was having too much fun.
Well, sorry.
But Maybe you could go skateboarding with Orson.
All right.
Forget about me.
Tom was having fun.
And from what I've seen, he needs it.
And what makes you think you know what my husband needs?
Just something that I saw the other day,
When you were making him get rid of All his things.
You mean his junk?
It May be junk to you,
But to Tom...
Well, that was stuff he was gonna get around to.
You know what a midlife crisis is?
I'm married to a 45-year-old man who has a red convertible.
Yeah, I think I know.
But you know how it happens? A man gets to a certain age,
And he realizes... He's gonna die someday.
Really die.
And what's worse is that he's everything he's ever gonna be.
He's never gonna be rich.
He's never gonna climb a mountain.
Now some guys do bad things
When they get those thoughts in their heads.
By comparison,
Playing in a garage band- well...
It seems pretty harmless.
So... Now my marriage is in trouble,
And you're gonna save it by giving Tom a bass?
No. No. I'm not.
You are.
Most of the guys in my class went into corporate law,
But I wanted to do something
That would influence environmental policy.
That's how he ended up at the e.P.A.
So, Leo, where did you study law?
Cornell.
Now I'm jealous.
I Always wished that I'd gone to a school like cornell.
But... It just wasn't in the cards for me.
How about you, Dave?
Me? No. Wasn't in my cards, either.
So where did you go?
After listening to Leo, I'd be embarrassed to tell you.
So... E.P.A.
What's your opinion on global warming--
Fact or fiction?
Hold on, Darling.
Mrs. Mccluskey asked you a question.
Tell her where you went to school.
Oh, Edie, I think she was just making conversation. So--
Okay, then why don't you tell me where you went?
After All, I am your wife. Shouldn't I know?
Actually, I didn't go to college.
I took a job out of high school
Because my family was having a hard Time.
Not having a degree is something that has Always
Been embarrassing to me,
Especially when I'm with people who do.
So, my darling, is there anything else
You'd like to quiz me about in public?
My... Childhood stuttering?
My dad's drinking problems?
No. I'm... Good.
I came to say I'm sorry.
You attacked my child and then me.
Why should I even listen to you?
I brought booze.
Come on in.
Like, I have this rule--
No toy guns.
Except everything that m.J. Picks up--
Whether it's a hairbrush, a hanger, everything--
He pretends it's a gun. Well, what do you expect? He's a boy.
That's my point!
I know nothing about raising boys.
And I think m.J. Has figured this out,
So he goes straight to Mike whenever there's a problem.
But that's okay. Mike's a great dad.
Yeah, sure, on Alternate weekends.
That's fine...
Until... M.J. Needs his daddy,
And his daddy's not there.
San, it's not your fault.
Well, we split up,
So it's at least half my fault any way you slice it.
Well, if it's any consolation,
Carlos is a hands-on, full-time dad,
And I still feel like I'm not getting the job done,
Like... I'm not preparing them enough.
Preparing them for what?
For how hard life is.
I mean, I have to admit,
When you told me Juanita was bullying m.J.,
My first thought was, thank god!
Let her do the pushing,
Just as long as she's not a victim.
Well, I don't see any kid of yours being a victim.
You're the strongest person I know.
I used to be.
Look at my life, Susan.
I...
I've been beaten down.
Well, I thought I had you beaten today,
And next think i knew, I was eathing grass.
Today doesn't count. Today I was mad.
Maybe you need to get mad more often.
Maybe you're right.
This is nice.
We should rumble All the Time.
To Susan Mayer--
Good mom.
To Gabrielle Solis--
Another good mom.
Mommy, we're hungry!
So?! There's waffles in the freezer!
And get mommy some ice!
Isn't this nice?
For the first Time in years,
My family is All here under the same roof.
Here's to many more meals together.
Yes. Aw. Welcome home. Cheers.
I don't feel good, Danielle.
"danielle"?
I think I'm gonna be sick. Let's get you to the powder room.
Here we are--
Mushroom risotto.
There's an unfortunate coincidence.
I'm so sorry, mom. I'll clean it up.
No, um, you take Benjy upstairs. I'll get it.
Orson, could you get the mop, please?
Oh, my god. Is that meat?
No!
Of course not.
Does this look like meat to you?
It's... Hard to tell.
Just so we're clear,
What I'm about to throw up is a western omelet.
That is not meat.
That piece right there- that's definitely meat!
Still waiting on that mop.
What did grandma give you to eat?
She said not to tell.
You gave him meat and then told him to lie?!
I gave him a hot dog, All right?
He liked it so much, he asked for another.
Two hot dogs?
All right,
I'll concede the second one was clearly a mistake.
Come on, Leo. We're leaving.
No! Danielle, please. I'm sorry, Orson.
She's made it impossible for us to stay in this house.
Danielle, wait, wait.
Well, we can still drink, right?
Oh, yeah.
Well, I've apologized till I'm blue in the face,
But they're still leaving in the morning.
Now you're not speaking to me, either?
They're just mad.
Things will be better next Time.
You honestly think there'll be a next Time?
It took us three years to talk them into this visit.
It took you one day...
To ruin it.
Orson, I'm truly sorry.
It's just, seeing...
All these mistakes that she's making with Benjamin,
It's just so hard for me.
You know what hard for me?
When I left for prison,
Benjamin was in my house, he was in my life.
He called me "daddy."
And when I came home, he was gone.
And you think that's my fault?
Yes, I do.
Orson, you weren't here.
She came back. She was married to a lawyer.
And don't forget, she is his mother!
I tried to fight, but--
You should've fought harder.
I was on my knees. I was sobbing.
She said "no" and then ripped him out of my arms.
You have no right to say that to me.
You kind of blindsided me tonight.
I know. I am so sorry.
I was clearly uncomfortable.
I don't understand why you kept pressing me.
Honestly, it was All Karen Mccluskey's fault.
Really? How so?
Well, she kept asking me All this stuff about yr background
And why I don't know more about you, and...
I should've just never let her get to me.
It's okay, sweetie.
Now I understand.
Kind of sad when you think about it.
What do you mean? Oh... Maybe you guys don't notice
Because you're so used to her.
But her behavior reminds me of my grandmother,
When we first started to notice...
The dementia, that is.
You think Karen's going senile?
I remember my poor grandmother...
Started getting so paranoid.
She thought people were breaking into her house and...
Stealing her things.
We finally had to put her in a home.
I just hope that doesn't happen to Karen.
I want my 300 bucks.
I told you. It's your car. You deal with it.
That's it? No compassion?
No, "hey, let's split the bill and call it even"?
Look at it this way. You're not losing 300 bucks.
You're gaining a valuable lesson--buyer beware.
True. Now here's a valuable lesson for you.
What t hell is wrong with you?! Give me my money,
Or next Time we're trading paint. You're bluffing.
I am tired of being a victim, Andrew.
And trust me, that is no bluff.
Hey! You--you touch my car, and you're paying for it.
Luckily, I'm insured. Oh, wait. Our policy lapsed.
Hope you've got good coverage.
Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait, wait.
I'll get my checkbook.
I prefer cash.
Bullies...
Any adult will tell you
The playground is not the only place to find them.
Everywhere you look, you can find people unconcerned
Or unaware of the pain they inflict.
It might be a neighbor
Preying on the suspicions of her friend...
Or a daughter
Punishing the choices of her mother.
Or a housewife
Seeking justice from the man who sold her a car.
Yes...
There are bullies everywhere.
And the worst are the ones who take advantage of you
Without you ever knowing
What they've done.

Previously on Desperate Housewives...
Bree's husband felt rejected. I think it's strange to see my wife billed
As "mrs. Van de kamp." it's how I'm known.
Is there a mr. Van de kamp? No, uh, mr. Van de kamp is deceased.
Would it have killed you to have mentioned me?
It's because I went to jail, isn't it? Lynette's husband was excited.
We're gonna start a garage band!
I thought you were the one who said you wanted
To spend more Time with your family. Guys need to blow off steam.
Edie's new husband had a past... You've been here six weeks,
And you don't seem any closer to coming to terms
With your rage. I've come to terms with it,
And I like it just the way it is. ...Which remained a mystery.
I just think it's odd that you're married to some guy.
You don't know anything about him. Well, she kept asking me All this Stuff
About your background.
And Susan tried to move on.
Well, I sort of started seeing someone. Good for you.
Every year, ms. Elenora BuTTers
Would ask her kindergarten class
To draw a picture of their families
Which she would then display on "meet the teacher" night.
That's how Ty Richmond's parents
Saw his depiction of their fighting...
And Amy Hines' parents
Saw her portrayal of their drinking.
And Jason Monte's parents
Saw his illustration of their hygiene.
You see, ms. Butters felt it was important
For parents to see themselves through their children's eyes.
She knew the experience...
Ed, he's got me vacuuming in my bra.
Do I do that?
Could be very Educational.
I know, I know.
Did I not say 7:00? You missed their little show.
M.J. Was tooth decay. Well, crosstown traffic killed me.
And I told you to videotape it.
Well, did you tell me to take off the lens cap?
Next Time, be more specific. Mr. Delfino, glad you made it.
Uh, did you get to see m.J.'s artwork?
No, not yet. Can't wait. Oh.
Oh, hey, look at that.
There we are, Standing in front of the house.
Look what he did with my hair.
I kind of like the bangs. Yeah, look, he put a wrench in my pocket.
And see how big my muscles are? Which is a good thing,
'cause there's a shark attacking the house.
Hey, daddy.
Hey, buddy. Your mommy and i
Were just looking at your wonderful painting.
You like it?
I love it, especially how big and strong you made me look.
That's not you. That's Jackson.
See the paintbrush in his pocket?
Oh, who's Jackson?
He paints our house...
Until my mom makes him drink wine and have a sleepover.
Because...
Mike and I are divorced, so that's why...
It was supposed to be a picture of the family,
So you should've put your daddy in it.
Did.
Oh, the... The bug with the little hat?
That's you,
'cause you're Always so far away.
Oh, yeah, that's, um...
Now I see me.
Yes... Every year,
Ms. Elenora BuTTers would ask her class
To draw a picture of their families,
Even though she knew the portraits...
Might not be that flattering.
If you look closely into the faces of your friends,
You'll see it.
Congratulations! Hi!
Come on in!
Right behind their smiles,
You will see a certain Green-eyed monster,
And then you'll understand
How envious they are of your well-kept home...
Your delious recipes...
And yourasteful ssessions.
Here's my cookbook.
But you'll have to work hard to see the jealousy,
Because good friends Always work hard
To hide it.
Look at you, right on the cover!
These are advanced copies.
I wanted you to be the first to have them.
Oh, and look, you signed it- "to Lynette,
The sweetest, most wonderful friend I've ever known."
"to Susan, the sweetest, most--"
We don't have to read them out Loud.
Don't mind me, ladies.
I'm just grabbing a kiss on my way to the
Salt mines. Mmm. Oh. Mmm. You have a good day
Thanks, babe. Oh, did you show thethe
Ad? Yeah. Oh, I Almost forgot. Uh, bye
Isn't this nice?
They're running it next month in "woman's day."
You're gonna be in magazines, too?
They've come up with this whole Marketing plan--
Radio, print, book signings.
Wow! Isn't it fantastic? No, it's horrible!
She's gonna become this famous author
And have no Time at All for us.
No, come on, Gaby. You know that Bree
Will never change. Thank you, Katherine
I will never become Stuck-up and full of myself.
I didn't say that. I said you'd never change.
Very funny.
I hardly think you have to worry about me becoming famous.
You have a Marketing plan.
You wanna see my Marketing plan?
"milk, bread, vodka, condoms--"
Could I see that? I'd love to read it. Why?
Well, back before I consecrated my life to mozzarella,
Marketing was sort of what I did.
Oh, right! Of course.
I would, uh, love to hear your thoughts.
So you're still gonna
Wanna hang out with us, even when you're totally fabulous,
And we're still nobodies?
Girls, you are making way too much of this.
I am not a bit more fabulous than any one of you.
Excuse me.
What is it, Andrew? I hope you're free for lunch on the 12th,
'cause the chamber of commerce
Just named you businesswoman of the year.
Oh, my god! That is so amazing!
The, uh, dry cleaner just, um...
Found my sweater.
Girls, catch up with you later!
Orson, I have amazing news.
The chamber of commerce just called. Oh? What about?
I wanna buy you lunch and tell you in person.
I will be at your office in two minutes.
Uh, no! No, don't come to my office.
You know, I can't have lunch now. Um, I'm in a meeting.
Well, I'll wait in reception until it's over.
No, it'll take hours.
It's a very urgent, high-level Stuff.
What kind of meeting is it?
George, hey!
Turn that radio down!
Where are you? I told you, I'm in a meeting.
I gotta go.
I'll see you soon.
Yes, you will.
Mike! What's going on?
Daddy got me a bike.
Yes, I see. And here,
Mommy thought we'd agreed to wait till your birthday.
Crazy mommy. Can you teach me to ride it?
No, not today. I gotta go install a water heater.
But, uh, you keep practicing,
And the next afternoon I have free, we'll bust off
Those training wheels and go kick up some dirt. Okay? Okay.
All right.
Oh, my god.
This is about m.J.'s drawing, isn't it?
Wh?
He does not love Jackson more than you.
He knows who his father is. I know that.
Can't a guy get his kid a bike without being psychoanalyzed?
So you're totally fine with that drawing?
Well, I won't go sticking it on my fridge anytime soon,
But yeah.
Look, I'm glad you're dating a nice guy.
I'm glad he likes my kid, and my kid likes him.
Here's a bike. That's All it is.
Hey, guys.
Jackson, look at my new bike!
Pretty cool.
Uh, that's a custom titanium frame.
Make sure m.J.Nows that.
So, Wendy, I gotta know about the weather.
Mommy, can Bethany go home now?
Honey, she's only been here 20 minutes.
We invited her over to play, so go play.
But All she does is spin.
...Somewhat across the reach of the state,
Knocking temperatures down I would say a few degrees...
Honey, we want Bethany to be our friend,
So if she wants to spin, just suck it up and spin.
Why are you shoving that little weirdo down Juanita's throat?
That little weirdo is the key to you and I having more sex.
I know I should ask a few questions, but I'm in.
Bethany's mom hosts a weekly playdate.
I'm trying to get Juanita an invitation.
How does that lead to quality Time with your boobs?
Carlos, the only Time you and I have to ourselves
Is late at night, but by that Time, we're too exhausted.
And now that we have Celia in afternoon preschool,
All we have to do is unload Juanita,
And then we can get back to doing the nasty.
This doesn't seem right.
I mean, dumping our kid off on some unsuspecting woman
So that we can have sex?
Wake up! Playdates were invented by mothers
For this exact purpose.
Shopping, sex, drinking in the afternoon--
Playdates make All these things possible.
I-i don't know.
I feel bad making my kid playing with someone
That she obviously doesn't like.
Bethany's mom will take Juanita once a week for two whole hours.
That is sex and a nap.
Juanita!
I don't hear you spinning!
I don't understand. You said the job was going so well.
It was. Then three weeks ago,
My parole officer left me a message at work.
That's when they found out I lied on my application
When I said I didn't have a criminal record.
So you've been pretending to go to work for three weeks?
I know you're angry.
Honey...
I'm not angry.
I'm hurt that you didn't feel like you could tell me.
I was embarrassed.
Bree, when we married, I was the breadwinner.
Now you--you have your company and you have your book.
I-i'm a felon who can't hold on to a job.
Orson, we're partners. We share everything.
Any success I have
Is just as much yours as it is mine.
Thank you, darling.
So...
Why did the chamr of commerce call?
Apparently, we've been named businesswoman of the year.
Is that good enough?!
Wow! You'd be killer in our band.
I mean, wouldn't he be killer, Dave? Uh,
Donald, why don't you let us talk it over
And we'll get back to you? No problem.
I have to get back to the office anyway.
Quarterly tax Time has got me swamped.
Well, we'll--we'll definitely call you today
Thanks, gentlemen.
Don't you think he crushed it?
He was good... You know, technically.
He didn't really have heart. What do you mean?
When he played "voodoo child," it was like Hendrix has risen.
Hey, what about Mike? I thought that's who we were gonna get.
Well, I asked, but he said he's too busy.
Too busy to live a little? Not gonna fly.
Call him. Give him my number.
I'll talk to him. Okay, sure. But--but what about Donald
I mean, 'cause if we don't get Mike, I wanna make s--
Tom, Donald's out, all right?
Have Mike call me.
What a rehearsal.
Dave and I were smokin'.
Did you hear us?
Lynette?
Lynette.
I'm sorry. What?
Never mind.
What are you working on? What, is this Bree's ad Stuff?
Oh, god, no. Her agency really whiffed... Hmm?
So I'm coming up with a whole new campaign.
I was looking through my old portfolio
For inspiration. Mm-hmm.
Oh! I remember this one.
"feet? Meet your new best friends." it was a classic.
You know, it been years since I looked through this Stuff.
I'd forgotten I was... Kinda great.
You were awesome!
I mean, come on. How lucky is Bree
To have a neighbor that used to be a big advertising hotshot?
Well, Maybe I'm the lucky one.
This could be a perfect way for me
To stick my toe back in the business.
Nothing big, Maybe just pick up some freelance work.
But, honey, if you do that, where you gonna find the Time
For the family and the restaurant? Well, gee, I don't know.
I gus the same place that you find Time for your garage band.
Lynette, I'm just saying that if--if you...
Okay, I dropped off Celia at preschool,
And Juanita's at her playdate.
Drop trou.
Why don't you put on that sexy red Teddy?
Can I ask why? I mean, you can't see it.
Yeah, but I can feel it,
And I love the sensation of sliding silk off your body.
What's it like, Carlos?
What?
Sex as a blind man.
I mean, you used to be so visual.
Is it still as good?
Oh, it's better.
I mean, having to rely on
Your senses of touch and taste and smell...
It's actually way more intense.
Really? You're so lucky.
What, you want blind sex?
I think I can arrange that.
Hey there.
Looks like somebody's job interview went well.
Nope. They turned me down flat.
Aw. But as I was driving home, it suddenly hit me.
I May be persona non grata at every company in this town,
But there's at least one employer I know
Who would love to hire me.
Oh. Who?
You.
You wanna work here?
Why not?
I'm great with food. I understand business.
I can't beat the commute.
Well, that's certainly an intriguing notion.
But wouldn't it be awkward having me as your boss?
Absolutely.
But as you said in the park,
We share everything.
So I would be more of a... Partner.
Partners? Oh.
Well- Bree, would you give me a hand with this arrangement?
Just give me a sec.
I think the lilies need their own vase.
If you hire him,
I will cut you with these scissors!
I don't think we need to do that.
I think they're crowding the irises out.
Just like he's trying to crowd me out.
You Already have a partner, remember?
Oh, well, I think the irises and the lilies
Could work together. Nope. One of them has to go.
If I May offer an opinion- not a good Time, Orson.
Tell him now,
Or I will walk.
Orson, you really don't wanna work with me.
I mean, you only see me at home.
But at work, when the pressure's on, I can be a bit of a handful.
Kathine's seen how I get. Oh, yes. Bitchy, Tyrannical, shrill--
He gets it, dear.
Honey, you're my partner in life.
But if we want to keep it that way,
We shouldn't mix marriage and business.
But no one else will hire me
Well, you've only been looking for a few weeks.
I mean, give it another... Say, month or two,
And  you still haven't found anything,
Then we'll revisit the idea. Okay?
Okay.
It was just a thought.
Oh, so what'd you think?
Oh, my god, you were right.
Blind sex is incredible.
Ahh, give me ten more minutes and an energy bar,
And we can go one more Time.
No, I think we're done.
Honey!
What are you doing home? I thought you were at Bethany's.
I got a tummyache. Her mom brought me back.
Well, how long have you been Standing there?
I don't know. What were you two doing?
Um, we were, uh...
We were wrestling. Wrestling.
Did daddy hurt you? You were making Loud noises.
No! No, that wasn't real.
Sometimes I fake it when I wrestle with daddy.
Please don't wrestle th mommy.
You're too big. You could hurt her.
Yeah, Carlos, stop that.
Okay, go to your room,
And I'm gonna bring you something for your tummy.
I think she bought it.
You mean the story of how daddy beats up mommy?
Relax. I told her I was fine. Look, I could hear the worry in her voice.
Why don't we just tell her the truth?
What, that sometimes mommy rides daddy
Like a mechanical bull to get jewelry?
She's 5. She's too young to understand
Either half of that. It's the facts of life
She's gonna learn 'em eventually,
And it's the most natural thing in the world.
Carlos, if she was Standing there
Any longer than five minutes,
There was nothing natural about what she saw.
By the way, thank you for that.
Hello?
Hey, it's me. Listen,
I've got some free Time,
So I thought I'd come over
And teach m.J. How to ride his new bike. Great. He's so excited to learn.
Are you sure he's ready to go without training wheels?
Oh, he'll probably have to take a few spills,
But luckily, he'll have his old man there to pick him up.
Yeah. He's been asking when you're coming.
I can't wait to tell him. I know he'll be just...
All right!
What's the Matter?
Spider. Big one. Gotta go!
Mommy, look, no traing wheels.
I know! You did great!
Jackson, can I see you a sec?
That was amazing! He learned so fast.
Yeah. You know what I learned? Mike is on his way over here
To teach his son how to ride the bike he bought--
Something he was looking forward to until you ruined it.
W-why didn't you tell me that? I didn't know
I had to tell you not to steal a father's precious moment.
M.J.--he just kept asking me.
He--he made me do it. You could've walked away
No, I couldn't!
He said, "pwease!"
Damn it.
As you can see, the graphic works just as well
On a free-standing display unit. Neat, huh?
Goodness, Lynette.
When you offered to share your thoughts on my campaign,
I wasn't expecting anything quite so... Elaborate.
Well, who knew your Marketing guys were such lame-os?
What they came up with is so...
Tepid.
Um, I think "understated" was what they were going for.
Well, they overshot and wound up in "bland,"
Right on the border of "sucky."
You need to grab your audience, just grab 'em.
I've gone for jazzier colors,
Bolder fonts.
Oh, I have really played up the whole nostalgia angle.
"let mrs. Van de kamp
Turn your oven into a Time machine."
I see women really responding to that.
Do you?
Because I see children
Crawling into ovens, hoping to see dinosaurs.
Okay. Well...
I've got a whole bunch of Alternatives.
Oh, Lynette, I appreciate everything you've done.
But I've actually approved the old campaign,
And I can't just tell them I've changed my mind.
You don't have to. I'll be the bad guy.
Just tell 'em you've hired me,
And I'll go in there, six-guns ablazing.
So... Do we have a deal?
Just give me the word.
No.
No?
Sorry, but I prefer their campaign.
But mine is better.
Well, you're... Entitled to think so, but I don't.
Look, Bree...
I think I know a little more about Marketing than you do.
When I was in it, I owned this town.
I had every big account.
Hell, I was even named businesswoman of the year.
Oh. Well, I'm familiar with that award.
In fact, I'm this year's recipient.
Really? Yes.
There's a luncheon on the 12th. I do hope you can make it. Oh.
By the way,
You're right about those colors.
Very... Jazzy.
Come on, m.J. Your daddy's waiting.
Mommy, I don't wanna fall.
Oh, honey.
You know how you like to push the button
When we go on the elevator,
And if somebody else pushes it first,
It makes you sad? But I don't wanna fall
Just listen. Daddy really wanted to be the one
To teach you to ride your bike, and if you can Already do it,
It's gonna make him sad.
So just let daddy push the button. Understand?
Oh, man.
Wow, he's really picking it up fast.
Yeah. I think it's just beginner's luck. Uh-huh.
Are you sure he hasn't been practicing?
No. He was absolutely waiting for you
You know, I think I'm gonna go check his helmet.
What are you doing? We talked about this.
You're supposed to be new at it. I don't want to fall. I'm scared.
Oh! Of what? You're 3 inches off the ground.
You're completely padded. So just do what I say--
Wobble, wobble. "daddy, look at me!" crash.
Boy...
He was just telling me
How glad he is to have his dad here. Really?
'cause I Almost feel like he doesn't even need me. Oh, that's just silly.
Whoops-a-daisy! Oh, it's a good thing your dad's here
To teach you how to do it right. Oh, looking good, buddy, but remember,
When you stop, you gotta put your foot down first.
Okay? Ow!
Oh, what, does that hurt right there, buddy? Oh, he's fine.
No, mommy. It hurts.
This is All my fault. Oh, will you stop?
The doctor said it was just a sprain.
I know, but still, I shouldn't have pushed it.
You know, why look for blame? Kids fall.
If you have to find fault,
Blame the pavement, not yourself...
Or me.
Mommy!
He should have his pitching arm back in no Time.
Oh, thank you. But I did wanna ask--m.J. Said that he fell on purpose,
Something about you telling him
To "let daddy push the elevator button"?
You told him to fall?
Remember, it's the pavement you're mad at.
What the hell, Susan? Why would you do something like that?
Jason taught him to ride the bike.
Jackson.
Who's Jackson?
He does sleepovers with mommy.
They drink lots of wine.
Hey, doc. Uh, don't you hand out lollipops to brave little boys?
I'm sorry. M.J. Was excited about the bike,
So Jackson took off the training wheels
And taught him. He didn't know.
He didn't know I'd wanna be the one
To teach my own kid how to ride a bike? Okay, you know what?
This is not Jackson's fault.
You can't give a 5-year-old a bike
And expect him to wait to ride it until you have Time.
You know, this is what it means to be divorced.
It means that sometimes you won't be there.
I know.
It's...
Just harder
Than I thought it would be.
Well, it's hard for me, too.
I miss things when he's with you.
And i...
Am trying to come to terms with my guilt, because...
I have to.
So do you.
There's nothing else you can do.
Has Mike called?
Hi, honey. You're home.
Sorry, hon.
So did he call?
No.
Hey, listen to this.
Mrs. Hudson's putting her house up for sale.
I think we should buy it.
Why?
As an investment. I-i mean, it's fantastic.
My friend Mary Alice blew her brains out in this house,
And All I'd have to do is let that slip,
And we'd get it for a song. Yeah. I don't think so.
Well, why not? We'll rent it out.
We could make some serious money. Last thing I wanna be is a landlord,
Get a phone call every Time a toilet overflows.
That's why we hire a management company- damn it, Edie, I said no!
Why are you yelling at me?
I don't know.
I'm sorry. I just got a lot on my mind.
I'm sorry.
Hi, Bethany.
I'm here to pick up Juanita. Is she around?
Boys have sperm.
Excuse me?
We need to talk.
So apparently, after we had our little chat with Juanita,
She went straight to Bethany
And passed on the facts of life in excruciating detail.
Well, did you explain to Peggy why we had
The little chat? She didn't wanna hear it
Not with Bethany running around the house,
Screaming "intercourse!" at the top of her lungs.
So we're out of the playdate? Oh, yeah. Way out.
Well, I guess it's back to the old schedule
Of ten minutes of grope 'n snore at midnight.
I'm not going back, Carlos. I can't.
If Juanita doesn't get her playdate,
You're not getting yours. Fine. I will fix it. I just don't know why
Peggy's making such a big deal out of this.
Sperm!
Juanita! Stop talking to your sister!
Orson, what are you doing in the guest bedroom?
Oh, I couldn't sleep.
You were snoring too Loudly.
Me? Snoring?
Mm, like a donkey with a head cold.
Honey, I don't snore.
Oh, you can't Always hear yourself.
But I hear you...
Loud and clear.
Oh, for heaven sakes, come back to bed.
No.
I'm good here.
Dave Williams
Look, hate to bother you,
But I got a busted pipe outside the house.
Probably some kids playing a prank. No problem.
I'm across town finishing up on another job.
So depending on traffic, give me...
Say an hour? Oh, thanks. I really appreciate it
So when Juanita thought that I might be hurting her mother,
We decided it was best that she knew the truth.
It just seemed like the right thing to do at the Time.
See, honey?
I-i knew there had to be a rational explanation.
Well...
I guess under the circumstances,
You didn't have y other choice.
So... Do you think there's any chance
Juanita could rejoin your playdate? We've talked to her.
She will never discuss sex ever again.
Not if she wants to see her favorite dolly Alive.
Gaby, we don't need to let them know
All of our parenting secrets.
I... Think that'd be okay.
I probably overreacted.
We just wanna keep Bethany's innocence as long as we can.
Oh, we totally agree.
Kids are forced to grow up way too fast these days. No kidding.
I want my girls to believe in santa claus as long as possible.
They're gonna find out soon enough that it's All a lie.
What?
There's no santa claus?!
So...
Next playdate's monday at 1:00?
Wow, whoever did this really went to town.
Yeah, I know. Damn kids.
By the way,
Did you put any more thought into joining the band?
Oh, man. I'm sorry. I've been meaning to get back to you.
I appreciate the offer,
But I'm really stretched thin these days.
Oh, come on. Every man's got Time for a little music.
Believe me, I'd love to play with you guys,
But, uh, I live 30 minutes away--an hour in traffic.
Whatever Time I've got left's for my son. Yeah, I hear ya.
Hey, you ever look into living a little closer by?
With the rent prices in this neighborhood?
I might play guitar like a rock star,
But I don't earn like one. Yeah. Sorry.
I wasn't thinking. Oh, it's All right.
Uh, appreciate you trying to help.
Believe me, I wish I could do more.
I've never seen Bree so happy. She's glowing.
She won't be glowing when that agency sinks her book. Lynette...
I'm telling you, the only thing staler than that ad campaign
Is this dinner roll. Yeah, and the water was as flat as the ad campaign.
Your Martini was as dry as the ad campaign. Let it go.
Hi, everybody! You having a good Time? Hi!
Hey, beautiful!
Um ,this is- Stu!
Lynette Scavo. I thought that might be you. Hey!
Everyone, this is my old assistant,
Stu, um... Durber. Durber.
Hey! Well, this was one great guy.
He would schlep All the way across town
Just to get me my chinese food.
So...
What are you up to?
Actually, Stu's company is doing all my advertising.
Your company? You have a company?
Three years now. Huh.
How about you? Are you still at, uh, Parcher & Murphy?
No, i... Also went into business for myself.
Her place makes the best pizza in town.
You own a pizzeria?
Well, it's really my husband's.
And I'm still doing some freelance Stuff.
Well, that's great. You know, we're Always working late. Mm-hmm. Oh.
Give me your card. We'll order from you some night. Oh.
You know, of course, we're across town,
So it May be a bit of a schlep. Oh!
It w great catching up, Lynette. Yeah.
Bree, let me introduce you to some people. Yeah, mm. Great.
There's my beautiful wife.
What are you up to?
Why? Looking for a reason to scream at me?
You're right. I was awful the other day.
How about I make it up to you
By buying you mrs. Hudson's house?
Seriously? Well, I thought about it, and I agree.
It's a good investment opportunity.
Oh! Thank you!
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Thank you. Thank you.
And I promise that we'll rent that place out for top dollar.
Oh, I'm not worried about that.
But first... I want to do someone a favor.
Where are you? It's after 2:00.
I'm getting ready for my job interview.
Oh, that's not until 4:00.
I'm reading the company's annual reports.
I want to be prepared.
Oh, honey. Everybody's asking about you.
I want you to be here. It's my big day.
Well...
Enjoy it.
You've earned it.
You know what this tastes like? More.
It would seem
Somebody's taking their designated driver position...
A little lightly. Stu?
Stu is doing Bree's ad campaign?
I rode in his hatchback once.
It smelled like mu shu.
I gotta warn her. Oh, wait! No, honey.
Why don't you wait till after the ceremony?
Yeah, just until you can blink both eyes at the same Time.
Guys, I am just gonna offer her a little advice. Geesh.
Whoop. Still waiting.
The great thing about the internet is that
With a minimal investment, you actually can reach
All your specific target audience- coupons.
Coupons?
Do a cross-promotion with some of the major food companies.
Knock off 20%
On some of the items featured in your recipes,
Then they do the same
Towards the purchase of your cookbook.
Yeah, our research shows, you know,
People aren't so hot on gimmicks- zip it, Stewie.
Would you excuse us, please?
Lynette, you're drunk.
Yeah, that's immaterial.
What do you think of the coupons?
Lynette, I am really not able to deal with that right now.
Oh. I know.
You've got your book and--and your big fancy award,
And I'm just a housewife.
I never said that.
You know, when I had a high-powered career,
And you were just a housewife, I never looked down on you.
If you could All please take your seats,
It's Time to present our award.
You need to leave now.
Fine. And don't worry.
Even though I'd like to, I'm not gonna make some big, ugly scene.
Hey. I, um, I bought m.J. So stilts,
Thought I'd teach him how to use 'em.
Har har. Uh, actually, he's at Juanita's watching a dvd.
Do you want me to call him?
No. No, it's cool. I just wanted to tell him about my new place.
You're moving again?
How far are you gonna be away now?
The Hudson house? Yeah, she sold it.
And Edie told me the new owner wants to rent it,
So now I'll have a fighting chance
Of being around when m.J. Hits his milestones.
Is this okay with you?
Yeah. It's great.
Uh, we'll be like...
One big, happy, divorced family.
You sure?
It's a little weird.
I--i but, you know, m.J. Will be thrilled, and...
Yeah, I'm fine with it.
Good.
So, um...
I'll see you around, neighbor.
I still think it's strange
You won't let me tell Mike that we're the new owners.
Well, the man's got a lot of pride.
I want him to feel like I'm his neighbor, not his landlord.
Landlord? Hell, with the rent we're charging him,
You're his fairy godmother.
All right, consider it an investment in good karma. Screw karma.
I finally do something nice in this neighbhood,
And I can't even brag about it?
The man who is silent in his good deeds
Is the man who reaps the greatest reward.
So...
Give me some guidance.
Do I grovel, send flowers, or...
Just move?
I'm not angry with you.
I'm just sorry that you felt so--
Drunk? Jealous?
You have nothing to be jealous of.
Don't give me that.
You are having the kind of success
I only dreamed of back in my ad days.
But that doesn't mean I look down on you.
No. But watching you, I look down on me.
When I held your book in my hands,
I felt so jealous my stomach hurt.
And I thought, if I could just hitch a ride,
Have a piece of it,
I wouldn't feel so bad about your success.
For god sakes, Lynette, stop calling me a success.
There's nothing successful about me.
My friends think I'm gonna drop them,
My partner resents me,
And my husband...
Has moved into the guest bedroom.
Everything I gain comes at some horrible price,
And I'm starting to wonder if any of it's even worth it.
It is.
You're at the start of an incredible journey,
And I am going to be there every step of the way,
Cheering you on,
Telling anyone who will listen
That the Bree Van De Kamp is my friend.
Thanks.
And the rest of the Stuff...
You'll find a wayto fix it.
Just know that All your friends are very proud of you.
Bitterly jealous, but proud.
If you look closely
Into the faces of those around you,
You will catch a glimpse
Of a certain Green-eyed monster.
And then you'll see they envy your career...
Your love life...
The Time you spend with their child...
How do you deal with such jealousy?
There are many ways.
But the best...
Is to simply share
What you have.
Thank you.
Promise me you'll never leave our bed again.
I promise...
Partner.
Previously on Desperate Housewives...
My name is bree, and I am an alcoholic.
Bree put her problem behind her.
there's at least one employer
who'd love to hire me.
Who?
Orson asked for a job.
You.
Dave lost his temper...
damn it, edie! I said no!
And aroused the suspicion...
this guy is up to something.
Of his neighbor.
It was all karen mccluskey's fault.
She kept asking me all this
stuff about your background.
She reminds me of my grandmother
when we first started to notice.
The dementia, that is.
You think karen's going senile?
it could have been
such a lovely evening.
You see, the idea was to have
a surprise birthday party.
People would bring food and gifts and wait
in the dark for the guest of honor to arrive.
But it turned out to be a
night full of surprises--
the kind most people don't care for.
Damn it, lynette. Why do you
have to be such a buzz kill?
Why can't you, just once,
give me a little support?
Fine. I'll get you a towel.
For what?
If I was with another woman,
that wouldn't bother you?
No, it wouldn'T.
I'm sorry that I lied, and for what it's
worth, the guilt has been tearing me apart.
Get your hands off me,
you selfish son of a bitch!
orson, please. You're putting
me in an impossible position.
Then let me make it simpler for you.
I want a divorce.
Oh, yes, it could have
been such a lovely evening,
but this was one party that was over...
before it even began.
surprise!
You think you can screw with me?
Moments before she was to leave for the
party, gabrielle solis was at her mirror,
halfheartedly putting the
final touches on her lips.
You see, a problem had
come to her attention...
damn.
One she couldn't gloss over.
Mommy, what are you doing?
Uh, well, mommy has a friend who visits her
every month, and she's late, and that's bad.
Why?
Because she's the one who assures me that
you won't get a baby brother or sister.
But I want a little brother.
I don't care.
oh, sorry. It's just...
mommy really misses her friend, and mommy's gonna
be really sad if her friend doesn't show up soon.
Now go downstairs and play.
Mommy has some praying to do.
well, I have your test results.
Congratulations. You're pregnant.
Mrs. Solis.
I don't care. You told me this couldn't
happen. You said it was impossible!
The human reproductive system is
complicated and often unpredictable.
Sometimes miracles happen.
This isn't a miracle.
This is a disaster.
My husband's blind.
Neither one of us have jobs.
My husband's blind.
Trust me. Children are a blessing.
You'll see. It'll all work out.
Well, I hope to god you're right.
And what does this number mean anyway?
That's your beta number, and it's high,
which indicates the possibility of twins.
Gaby, relax.
This baby is gonna be the best
thing that ever happened to us.
I am so sick of everybody
looking at the glass half-full.
The glass is empty, people,
and so is our bank account.
Is that what you're
worried about--money?
Look, I'll get a job.
What are you gonna do, take up
piano and get a contract with motown?
Actually, I was thinking
about becoming a masseur.
You don't need your eyes for
that. It's all about the touch.
Well, I guess that's not the
worst idea you've ever had.
But it's not just about
the money, carlos. It'S...
oh, after my miscarriage,
I gave up on this dream.
I just figured god decided I couldn't possibly
be a good mom, so he didn't make it happen.
Well, he obviously changed his mi.
Well, I wish he'd stop doing that.
Nobody likes a fickle god.
Babe, believe me.
You getting pregnant is--is- is a
one-in-a-million shot. It's a miracle.
Now let's embrace it and celebrate.
Hello, mrs. Solis.
I have your test results.
Great. So do I have anemia?
Is that why I've been so tired?
No. Not exactly.
And please don't slap me.
I'm pregnant!
Oh, my god. It's another miracle.
Yeah, we're up to two miracles, and if you come
back from the dead after I kill you, it'll be three.
w-why you mad at me?
"Oh, gaby, why do I
need to wear a condom?
There's no way lightning's
gonna strike twice."
Well, I didn't think it would.
Put the baby down, carlos.
I don't want to.
Do it. I need to hit something,
and it needs to be you.
You are looking at this all wrong.
This is one-in-a-million.We should--we
should celebrate and embrace--
oh, cram it, you fertile freak.
You're getting a vasectomy.
I can't do that. We're catholic.
It's against our religion.
I got news for you. We
just converted to judaism.
Problem solved. Mazel tov!
Gaby, it's not just
that.There are other reasons--
I am done fighting
off your bionic sperm.
You're getting snipped,
and that's final.
you're awfully quiet tonight.
Got a lot on my mind.
I think I'm pregnant.
What?
I know. It's crazy.
You had a vasectomy. It's impossible.
Yeah. So what makes
you think you're preant?
My period's late, and that never
happens to me. I'm like a swiss clock.
Oh, come on. There could be
a lot of reasons for that.
So let's not worry about it right now.
We're going to a party.
You gotta lighten up.
Okay. But I'm gonna talk to bob.
Bob? Why?
Because he and lee are
here. Bob's an attorney.
I'm gonna get him to sue the qck
who obviously botched your vasectomy.
Oh, gaby, let's not go there.
Hiring an attorney's expensive, and I
don't know that we can prove anything.
Well, I'm gonna find out.
Fine. But... let's not talk to bob.
I don't want our neighbors
involved in our business.
oh, don't worry. He's a professional.
He'll keep it confidential.
Gaby, no. You can't talk to him.
Why the hell not?
I never got a vasectomy.
Hi, guys. Welcome to the party.
Earlier that evening, as she
waited for her guests to arrive,
susan mayer took a
moment to do her eyebrows.
Of course, she had no way of
knowing just how hh those eyebrows...
sorry I'm late.
Would soon be raised.
What took you so long? People
are gonna be here any minute.
I need you to pour the cheap
vodka into the expensive bottles.
I couldn't find my pants.
I'm here so much that when I go back to my
place, I can't remember where anything is.
Well, just please change your shirt.
You know, I've been thinking that I spend
so much time with you now anyway that--
fine. You can have a
little space in the closet.
I think I've got some clothes from
the '80s I'm ready to part with.
Actually, I'm talking about moving in.
Moving in? Here?
Yeah. That's where we're headed. We
should take the plunge. What do you think?
So obviously, this is the bedroom.
Right.
So do you want to stick with this
color or switch it up or what?
I don't know.
I'm sort of going through a difficult
transition in my life right now.
I need a change.
Uh, I was thinking... taupe.
Sounds good.
You know, I like this
place. It's got a good vibe.
Uh, thanks.
And a nice scent. What
is that, your perfume?
Get out.
excuse me?
I was not born yesterday, pal.
You're coming on to me.
No, I'm not.
Oh, please. Telling me I smell good?
I'm not even wearing deodorant.
I said the house smells good.
Semantics. And then the not so
subtle sit-on-the-bed maneuver?
You know, why not
just ask for a massage?
I sat because my feet hurt from
you dragging me around for an hour,
telling me you want to
paint every room taupe.
You said you liked it.
Look, you're obviously
going through a rough patch.
I was afraid if I suggested
anything outside the beige family,
I might send you over the edge.
I'll let myself ouT.
No. No, don't go.
That was very sweet of you
to consider my feelings.
You know what? You're hired.
Uh, thanks... I think.
So do you need to look
these over one more time?
Okay, then just sign them, and
you'll be officially divorced.
You know what? We need a minute.
Take your time.
are we doing the right thing here?
you're kidding me, right?
Once we sign these papers,
there's no going back.
I can't believe this.
You were the one who called the lawyer.
I know.
I'm thinking...
that maybe that was a mistake.
We've been separated for a year.
All we're doing today
is making it official.
We wouldn't be here if it weren't
for that accident. You know that.
Before that, we were good.
we could get back there.
Susan...
it's nobody's fault, but
I can't do this anymore.
Oh, come on!
We were mike and susan, remember?
You only get one of those in a lifetime.
We could make things right again.
Yeah.
And here's how.
You're back.
So what do you think?
it--it
looks good.
Yeah, I-I-I think you were right to
stick with this color. It looks fantastic.
Thanks.
Do you like scotch?
Okay...
I need to be honest about something.
H-honest? Okay.
I don't usually do this kind of thing,
hook up like this, out of the blue.
Not that it wasn't great, 'cause it was,
but I'm not really looking to start anything.
Work is crazy, and I
just got a dog, and...
I'm just not in that place right now.
So just to be clear, you're saying
you don't want a relationship?
Sorry.
I probably should have
said that right up front.
No, uh... it's fantastic.
Really?
I don't want a relationship either.
All I want from you is
exactly what we just did.
Except next time, it's susan.
Yeah.
"Mrs. Mayer" was probably a
little formal for the moment.
so there's gonna be a next time?
Unless you're not interested.
Are you kidding?
I'm this close to doing a
victory lap around the bed.
So you're really fine with this,
just a purely physical thing?
I gave romance a shot and...
I'm ready for something
a little more casual.
I've heard of women like you, but...
I thought you were an urban myth.
did you hear what I said?
Uh, yeah. You want to move in.
I-it's just that when I'm not with
you, I'm waiting to be with you.
I've never felt like this before. So...
what do you think? Do
you want to live together?
no.
So that's it? Just no? You're
not gonna give me a reason?
What's wrong with the way things
are? Why change everything now?
Because... I've fallen in love with you.
Hi, guys. Welcome to the party.
The last thing lynette scavo did before
a party was to check for gray hairs.
Penny! Let's go! Time for bath!
She had no way of knowing before this
evening was over, e would have a few more.
penny!
Penny.
If you're thinking of taking that
for a spin, I've got bad news.
You're 9.
Hey, what's the matter, sweetie?
Is daddy dying?
What? Of course not.
Why would you say something like that?
I heard porter and preston fighting about
who's gonna get daddy's car when he dies.
They're just being silly.
They're always silly.
That's why we won't be sad when
they move out of the house. Come on.
But everybody dies someday, right?
Yes, but daddy's gonna live to a ripe old age unless
he doesn't get home in time for mrs. Mccluskey's party,
and then all bets are off.
Oh, daddy's gonna be fine. Come on.
My husband- I'm
lynette scavo.
Dr. Baron called
me-  I'm dr. Baron.
What happened?
Your husband was working on an
electrical panel at his restaurant...
And received a massive shock.
Essentially, his heart stopped pumping.
Is he...
fortunately, there was a
policeman eating in the restaurant.
He administered C.P.R. Until
the ambulance got there.
so he's okay?
His heart restarted.
Now it's a matter of determining
if there's any tissue damage.
We're optimistic, but the
next 36 hours are critical.
father o'brien, please report to the...
so I'm thinking no more
electrical work, okay?
The kids know everything's fine.
They send their love.
Don't worry about
anything, okay? Just rest.
I'll come back soon, okay?
You know what I thought?
When I was lying there on the floor,
I thought, I'm gonna
die in a pizza place.
I mean, my whole life was gonna be
summed up with this obituary headline--
"local pizza shop owner dies."
But it doesn't matter
because you're not dying.
I need more, lynette. I need--
th-there's gotta be more.
Okay. Okay. We'll find more.
Just rest now, okay?
hey, sexy.
Drop the rake and get in.
What the hell is this?
This is the car that I
have wanted my whole life.
When I was 12 years old, I had a
poster of this baby up on my wall.
And when I was 12, I had
a poster of shaun cassidy,
but you don't see me driving
around in him, do you?
I want to show you something.
What, do machine guns
come out of the headlights?
I carry this around to remind
me of the day that i almost died.
That day you promised me
that we would find more.
I'm keeping the car.
So do you want a ride?
where have you been?
So help me, if mccluskey gets
there before us, I will brain you.
Sorry. Let's go.
Well, sheesh.
Sweetie, we already got karen a candle.
An R.V.Might be overkill.
Yeah, but that's not
for her. That's for us.
I'm about to blow your mind, lynette.
oh, don'T. I like my mind the way it is.
What would you say to the idea of
taking the kids out of school for a year
and bopping around the country
in one of these sweet rides?
well, I might not say anything.
I might justut my finger to my
ear and twirl it in small circles.
We can't do something like that, tom.
Yes, we can.
We can do whatever we
want. Life is short.
Okay, let me ask you one tiny question
about this big adventure plan of yours
who's gonna be running our restaurant while
we're off doing the electric kool-aid acid test?
That won't be our problem.
The last few weeks, I've been talking
to a guy from passentino's pizza.
They want to buy us out.
this afternoon, I said yes.
Hey, guys. You ready to party?
Moments before she was
due at her friend's party,
bree hodge was at the
mirror, applying her eyeliner.
Aren't you dapper?
When I tell everyone I'm your new
partner, I want to look the part.
It would not be the last time that
evening bree would find herself...
um, actually, dear...
drawing a line.
I'd rather you not talk
about the job tonight.
But, bree, this is the first party in months
when I can answer the question, "what's new?"
Without mumbling into my drink.
Well, it's just vulgar to
discuss business at a party.
You haven't told
katherine yet, have you?
It's not that easy. You
know she'll be furious.
Yes, but the great thing about katherine is
she'll express it so passive-aggressively,
we'll hardly notice.
Look, I know she's your friend,
but she's also our employee.
Why is this so difficult for you?
It'S... complicated.
Well... another dead soldier.
Careful, dear. You don't
want to be ill tomorrow.
Yes. Nothing like a headache to spoil
a perfectly nice first day in prison.
uh, would anybody like
some more frittata?
Is my wife amazing or what?
I mean, how many inmates get sent
off with a festive champag brunch?
Uh, w-when you're in jail, you might want
to avoid words like "festive" and "brunch."
They kind of say, "hi.
I'm husband hunting."
andrew, please.
It's fine.
This is my last taste of
freedom for three years.
I want jokes. I want fun, laughter.
Anyway, prison won't
be such a big change.
You're a dentist. You're
used to cavity searches.
You vowed to me that
you wouldn't say that.
bree tells me that you're going to
make very good use of your time away.
Uh, yes. He's going to read a lot of
classic books, maybe study a language.
Yes, uh, he can learn the italian
for, "I cost five cigarettes."
andrew, really.
Bree, he's joking. Everything's fine...
except my glass, which
seems to be empty.
bree? Bree?
Oh, for god sake. Get up.
We have the garden club lunch in...
you've been drinking?
go away. I don't feel well.
We have a lunch to cater.
I'm too tired. Can you do it?
Get up.
When did this start?
When orson left, I...
began having a glass of
white wine now and then.
Then when danielle took benjamin, I
didn't see any reason to stop at just one.
So is this why you missed the lunch
last week and the braverman bar mitzvah?
I can't help myself, all right?
My husband's gone. My son's
gone. I have nothing left.
No, actually, you have a
lunch for 40 in 3 hours,
and I'm not letting you out of it.
Oh, katherine, please.
Okay, so you have a void in
your life. Welcome to the club.
Don't fill it with wine.
Fill it with work, with accomplishments.
Just think about the woman you
could be by the time orson gets back.
Or is this the woman you
want him to come home to?
He's gonna be so ashamed of me.
No, he won'T...
because you're not gonna tell him.
You know he'd just blame himself.
I don't know if I can make it this time.
Yes, you will, because I am moving in.
You would do that?
When I had nothing, you
made me your partner.
I'm not gonna forget that.
I am gonna get you through this.
And when we're done, that
scary woman over there--
she's never gonna be
seen in this house again.
When you think about it, tonight is the
ideal time for you to tell katherine.
The presence of the other guests
will keep her from causing a scene,
and as word spreads
that we're partners--
and how is word going to spread?
I'll be spreading it.
People will be congratulating me, and katherine
will have to join in and risk looking petty.
And she'll be twice as mad at
having been put in that position.
I am not telling her tonight.
Fine. Then I will.
No, you will not. I forbid it.
You know, for a partner, you're
sounding a lot like a boss.
I am telling her.
Look, if we can't agree on something this
basic, maybe we shouldn't work together.
What are you saying?
I'm saying, maybe you should
reconsider joining the company.
I have no intention of reconsidering.
Fine. You're fired.
Hey, guys. You ready to party?
the party was in full swing, and everyone
was waiting to surprise the guest of honor.
Little did they know, an even
bigger surprise was on its way.
Sorry I'm late. There
was a line at the bakery.
Well, you really went all out.
Yeah, she deserves it.
Can I help you, mrs. Mccluskey?
This letter for edie came
to my house by mistake.
I'm making sure that none
of my stuff, uh, came here.
Well, it's all yours.
Anything interesting?
Fortunately, no.
I just saw your friend karen outside.
Is she still asking
you questions about me?
A few, but don't take it personally.
Prying is what people too old to
have sex do to keep life interesting.
She's turning 70 next week.
No kidding.
Hey, we should throw her a party.
I'm already taking her out
for a drink. That's plenty.
She'll be 70, sweetheart.
Don't you think that
calls for something bigger?
Look, karen's a friend, but I
don't like having her in my house.
It would be one thing if we had a bathroom
with a window you could open, but...
well, couldn't you ask
someone else to host it?
Well, I suppose I could palm it off to mayer.
Good.
Tell her we'll supply
the food and liquor.
You know, karen's not a fan of yours.
Why do you want to throw her a party?
It's a big day for her.
I just want to make sure it's special.
So...
what do you think?
I think that is one hell of an outfit
to wear to a 70th birthday party.
It's my gift to karen.
I figure she'll get at least
five good boob jokes out of it.
Well, she'll be here soon, so
let's go over this one more time.
Okay.
I take her home, then I come up with
some excuse to get her over to susan's,
where everyone jumps out
and yells, "surprise!"
Which I still say isn't the
smartesthing to do to a 70-year-old.
mrs. Mccluskey. Happy birthday.
Jeez, edie, are we going
for drinks or mammograms?
That's one.
Oh, let me grab my earrings,
and we're good to go.
So...
It's quite a milestone. How's it feel?
No big whoop.
Edie told me that she takes you
out for a birthday drink every year.
I think that's a great tradition.
Look, I'm just trying
to be friends here.
all righty then.
I'll see you later. Come on. Let's go.
I've got enough friends.
Where's karen?
She'll be here as soon as she
gives her cat some medicine.
Do I you think she'll be surprised?
Oh, absolutely.
what the...
dave.
Just so I'm clear, you want us to sell our thriving
business so we can live in a bus, like carnies?
Come on. This is cool. We
can go wherever we want.
The--the kids
could see america.
And when we start stealing to support
ourselves, the ki can see the inside of a prison.
You're right, tom.
It's a brilliant idea.
Damn it, lynette. Why do you
have to be such a buzz kill?
Why can't you, just once,
give me a little support?
Fine. I'll get you a towel.
For what?
Bree, you can't fire me, not after
all the sacrifices I made for you.
Orson, stop throwing jail in my face.
You cellmate was a crooked C.P.A.
Who helped you form a bridge club.
It wasn't exactly attica.
Bree, I need this job.
Do you have any idea what it's like to wake up
every morning and have no reason to get out of bed?
To smile and nod at neighbors who know your wife's
supporting you because no one will hire a felon?
I am drowning, and for you to throw
me a lifeline and then snatch it away--
orson, I should have never offered you
that job. It wasn't fair to katherine.
I am your husband.
Why are you putting katherine's
feelings ahead of mine?
Orson, please. You're putting
me in an impossible position.
Then let me make it simpler for you.
I want a divorce.
Katherine, great dress.
You're gonna turn some
heads with that one.
I hope you're enjoying this party, carlos,
because you're not gonna live to see another one.
Look, I'm sorry that I lied, and for what it's
worth, the guilt has been tearing me apart.
You know what's gonna tear me apart?
Another 10-pound baby
shooting out my hoo-ha.
Honey, look at it this way, god blessed
us again because you are such a great mom.
Get your hands off me,
you selfish son of a bitch.
I told you i love you.
Doesn't that mean anything to you?
Yes. It means that someone forgot that
we had an agreement to keep things casual.
Okay.
So if we're not in a relationship, if I was
with another woman, that wouldn't bother you?
No, it wouldn'T.
Quiet, everyone. She's coming. Move it.
surprise!
You think you can screw with me?
What do you mean?
Karen, what the hell are you doing?
Ask that husband of yours!
no!
Let's not be doing that.
No, that man broke
into my house tonight!
What?
Yes, and he- and he moved things around,
and he--and heook a picture off the wall,
and then he put the table next to
the couch, and the dish for the keys--
it's always by the...It's
always by the door.
And that's not the first
time he's broken in either.
He stole my cat, and
then he put him back.
Okay, mrs. Mccluskey, why
would I do those things?
Karen, I hate to say it, but you're
not making a lot of sense right now.
Maybe you need to lie down.
You...
I think we
should call 9-1-1.
Let go of me!
Why are you all acting like I'm crazy?
Halle-damn-lujah,
I got my period!
Oh, was she surprised?
She seemed totally
disoriented, babbling.
I just hope it isn't dementia.
She lives by herself.
We'll alert the hospital. We're
gonna need a psych evaluation.
Thank you. Thank you.
poor karen. I hope she's okay.
Yeah, me, too.
We should probably talk now, huh?
Yeah. Let's talk.
Does this relationship have a future?
Jackson, what we have here
has been working pretty well.
Answer the question.
Can't we just keep going the way we are?
And there's my answer.
it seems like they're
taking good care of her.
I hope you didn't mean
what you said earlier.
You just don't understandwhat
I owe to katherine.
You're right. I don'T.
You started the company and gave
her a job when she needed one badly.
Why are you the one who owes her?
You know that...
brunch we had for you right
before you left for prison?
I was very tense, and
I was very unhappy.
So I had...
a glass of champagne.
She's tough. I'm sure she'll be okay.
How about the crazy married couple
throwing drinks? How are they gonna be?
You know, I just thought that you got it, that
you knew what I was going through after accident.
You know, obviously I was wrong.
No, I get it.
The sports car, the garage band...
maybe what we need now,
tom, is for you to get it.
Hey, I was the one laying on the
floor with a cop pounding on my chest.
And I had cancer. I get it. I get it.
You want your life to countor something.
Exactly.
I just don't want to keep making pizzas
every day till I drop to the floor for real.
I want my life to be exciting.
You know, I need adventure.
Scavo's was the adventure.
We changed our whole lives so you could
live out your dream, and now you're bored.
We can't keep doing this, tom.
We can't keep throwing all the cards up in
the air every time you get a little restless.
Let's call it a night.
We have to work tomorrow.
Are you coming?
I'll come when I'm ready.
Did she really need an ambulance?
I don't know.
But you would have if I
hadn't started my period.
How could you have done this?
Isn't it obvious? I want another kid.
We can't handle another kid.
We're living hand to mouth as it is.
That's what you said before we had juanita
and before we had celia, and somehow we manage.
And can you imagine
our lives without them?
Of course I can'T. It's just...
how could you have lied to me?
I just couldn't shake the idea that maybe
god had one more miracle in store for us.
Maybe a son.
And we have so much love in our
lives, I got greedy, and I wanted more.
But you're right. It was selfish
and stupid, and I am so sorry.
I will call tomorrow
and schedule a vasectomy.
Or... we use birth control,
and I'm talking double-bagging,
at least until we both
decide it's a good idea.
I think I gotta kiss you.
And until we get a box of condoms in
that house, that's all you're gettin'.
Orson. What's up?
Bree told me what you did
for her when I was in prison.
I just want to thank you.
It's nothing.
Not to bree or me.
And you were dead right to
stop her from telling me.
I'd consider it an honor to
work for somebody that wise.
Work for? The last I
heard, it was partner.
All right, how's this?
I'll become a partner...
but only after you decide I've
earned it. I'm a patient man.
I don't care if it takes two years.
Oh, honey...
working for bree--
you're not gonna last ten months.
Mind if I say good-bye to our girl?
Sure, but she's a little groggy.
You planned the whole thing.
You're trying to get rid of me.
Yes.
And I'm sorry it had to be you.
'Cause I know you're
up to something--
something awful.
You don't know what "awful" is.
You take care of yourself,
karen, and I mean that.
Yes, it was a night
filled with surprises.
some had learned of their
husband's plans for the future...
others had discovered the
truth of their wife's past...
some were touched by their
husband's secret longings...
others were hurt by their
lover's quick departure.
But for one resident, the
evening had gone as planned,
and he now turned his
thoughts to his real agenda.
It wouldn't be long now before he
destroyed the man who had ruined his life,
but he knew he had to move carefully.
After all, he wanted
it to be a surprise.
Previously on...
We had an agreement
to keep things casual.
Susan made her feelings clear.
So if I was with another woman,
that wouldn't bother you?
No, it wouldn't.
You work here?
I'm great with food.
I understand business.
Bree made Orson a partner.
Is she still asking you
questions about me?
A few.
And Dave took steps to get
Karen McCluskey out of the way.
You think you can screw with me?
Karen!
Stop doing that.
 As a masseur
for the Fairview Country Club,
Carlos Solis
had become an expert
on how to make women happy.
That's why he always had
scented candles waiting
for Sue Bridges...
New age music
for Betsy Daniel...
And apple schnapps
for Shannon Glenn.
Yes, Carlos had made
a lot of women happy
over the years.
But on one very unusual
Wednesday afternoon...
He made
Mrs. Virginia Hildebrand
a little happier...
than he intended.
Helen said your last reservation
just canceled.
Do you want a ride home?
Thanks, Clay. That'd be great.
Um... can I ask you something?
How long you been a masseur?
14 years.
Okay.
And in all those years...
have you ever accidentally
given a woman...
an orgasm?
An orgasm?!
Keep your voice down.
You want to get me fired?
How do you accidentally
give a woman an orgasm?
I don't know.
I can barely give my girlfriend
one, and I try really hard.
All I did
was touch her back.
Are you sure?
Some of these old broads--
their bodies drop.
Not everything's
where it's supposed to be.
I may be blind, but my sense
of touch is just fine.
Well, then maybe she just
really liked the massage.
You wouldn't believe
the moaners I get on my table.
I'm telling you,
her body was quivering,
and she could barely breathe.
All right, well, there's one
sure-fireway to find out.
Where's your tip envelope?
On the counter.
How much she leave me?
Enough for two orgasms.
Yes...
Carlos Solis was an expert
on how to make women happy.
I'm about to go get groceries.
Where are your tips?
Oh, my god!
How did you get so much?
And he knew the best way
to keep his wife happy...
Just... good at my job.
Well...
Mwah.
was to lie.
There are dangerous women
in this world--
devious predators
waiting to strike.
You can spot them
by the lipstick they use,
the shoes they wear
and the perfume they choose.
But the easiest way
to spot a dangerous woman
is to see how she behaves...
I am about to make you
so happy.
with another woman's husband.
Amy, don't worry
about the lunch specials.
I am only two blocks away.
I'll take care of it once I...
Actually, you do them.
I'm gonna be a while.
Tom?
H--Lynette, hey.
What--what are you doing here?
So funny. I was gonna ask you
the same question.
But I was gonna
start with "what the hell?"
You remember Anne, right?
Anne Schilling.
Kirby's mom.
We were room parents together
in the third grade.
Right.
So... what the hell?
Tom, why don't we just
show her?
It's for my band.
Anne has been helping us
find a rehearsal space.
Oh. Oh.
That's right.
You're a realtor.
Now I know what you're thinking.
It seems like a waste of money.
But I just got them
to reduce the rent
and throw in
the utilities.
And you're always complaining
about the noise
when we practice in the garage,
so, you know...
what do you think?
It's great.
You do?
Yeah.
Ah!
Wonderful.
Yeah.
Listen, I have
to be somewhere by 10:00,
So why don't we
sign a lease right now?
Wow! I-I was convinced that you
would think it was a dumb idea.
Well... it's a little dumb,
but compared to what
I was thinking...
What we you thinking?
Well, it's just...
I saw you two together,
and I...
I didn't know that you were...
And she looks so...
For god sakes, Tom,
the woman has to be somewhere.
Just sign the damn lease.
So out of nowhere, Jackson says,
"let's move in together."
I-I mean, of course
I was stunned.
And then when I said no,
he just broke up with me.
I mean, does he really
expect me to be in love
after just five months?
That's crazy.
Yeah, I guess, although his work
on these moldings is amazing.
You really want me
to repaint these, Suzanne?
It's Susan.
And he was the first one to say
he didn't want to get serious.
Which is why I was happy.
We were just having fun.
Well, maybe you should
call him.
How do you like this color?
Not so much.
Frank, how can I call him?
He's the one
that ended it with me.
Look,
the guy makes you happy.
He says he loves you.
You gonna let pride stop you
From finding out
where this thing could go?
Come on.
Don't be stupid.
How much am I paying you?
$14 an hour.
That's not enough.
No, ma'am, it's not.
Carlos,
what are you doing home?
Uh, Virginia insisted
on giving me a ride.
You must be Gabrielle.
Carlos has told me
so much about you.
I'm Virginia Hildebrand.
Oh!
You are the Mrs. Hildebrand.
Well, you're
Carlos' favorite client.
Oh!
Well, mine, anyway.
I bought this top with
that crazy tip you gave him.
Your Carlos has
helped my back problems
like no masseur
I have ever had.
I'm pain-free
for the first time in years.
Oh, that's Carlos for you.
Mr. Magic Hands.
He hits the ol' sweet spot
every time.
Okay, Gaby.
I should go now,
but promise you'll at least
consider my little proposal.
What proposal?
I hate to stop when we're
making so much progress,
but I need to go to Europe
for two months,
mostly London and Rome.
I'd be so grateful
if Carlos were to accompany me
as my personal masseur.
Two whole months?
See? I told you. It's too long,
and Gaby has the girls and--
I know it's a lot to ask,
which is why
I'm offering Carlos $50,000.
$50,000?
Per month.
Well, pip-pip
and arrivederci!
Gaby.
I'll leave you two to discuss it.
Well, uh, what's to discuss?
For that kind of money,
you can lock him in a cage
and feed him peanuts.
I'll see you tomorrow, Carlos.
Lovely meeting you, Gaby.
Carlos, don't even think
about saying no to this!
She is not my only client.
I'll be letting down
the rest if I go.
Mr. Banks could even fire me.
Oh, don't worry about Mr. Banks.
I'll take care of him.
Gaby!
And so what if he fires you?
Once Virginia tells
all of her rich lady friends
about what you did for her,
they'll be lining up around the block.
Great.
Hey, great news.
I just got a call from
my old friend, Peter Hickey.
I don't recall ever hearing
that name before.
He's a friend from college.
Anyway, he mentioned that
his parents' 50th anniversary
was next month,
and I convinced him to let us
cater it. Dinner for 80.
80?!
He shoots, he scores!
Orson! You are amazing!
Oh!
One week on the job,
and he's already
bringing in huge accounts.
That's great.
Well, better go marinate those
scallops for the lunch tomorrow.
Oh, scallops? Done.
Done?
Mm. Oh, I also made
the pesto mayonnaise,
and I put the individual
cobblers in their ramekins.
Oh. Well, it looks like we're
all set until the morning then.
Hey, why don't you, uh,
take the afternoon off?
And do what?
I don't know--read, relax,
give yourself a pedicure.
Fine.
What do you bet
I take my socks off
and see Orson's
already done it for me?
What are you doing?
Refrigerator needs cleaning.
No, it doesn't.
And besides, I gave you
the day off. Now go home.
I'm thinking about
moving to Maryland.
Maryland?
Mm-hmm. Dylan's there
with her husband,
and the baby's coming soon.
Maybe it's time for me
to go inflict myself on them.
You can't just up and move.
You have a life here.
No, I don't. I have a job--period.
No kids to raise, no husband,
no boyfriend.
Might as well throw in the towel
and... go be a grandma.
Katherine, you are a vibrant,
attractive woman. You--
Who hasn't had sex
in two years.
That spells "grandma" to me.
I haven't made up my mind yet.
Just let me think about it.
And help keep me busy.
When you're done with that,
The oven could use
a really good scrubbing.
Bless you.
Karen?
Oh. Those must've
set you back a chunk.
Yes, they did...
Not that you deserve them.
I don't blame you
for being mad.
I'm not mad.
I'm furious.
Now what the hell
were you thinking,
coming at my husband
with a baseball bat?
I know.
I'm really sorry, Edie.
The doctor had me on these
new meds, and it made me loopy.
I thought Dave
was messing with my head,
And all the time,
it was the damn pills.
Well, I hope
you stopped taking them.
You bet.
I had to get my marbles back.
Uh, look, I know
you just got here,
but I am so sleepy and...
Of course. I'll see you
when you get home.
Actually, I'm gonna
call my sister
and see if I can
stay with herr for a while.
I don't think I should
be on my own just yet.
Okay. Then I'll
see you whenever.
Oh, be sure and tell Dave
how sorry I am.
He will be so glad.
He's really fond of you,
you know.
Oh, come on, come on,
come on, come on.
Hey, Sis. It's Karen.
Do me a favor
and get your sorry ass over to
Fairview Memorial Hospital
A.S.A.P.
I need you big-time, kiddo.
Come in.
Hi. I'm looking for Orson Hodge.
I'm Peter Hickey.
Oh! Yes, of course.
Uh, I'm his wife Bree.
I'm afraid
he's out running errands,
but he's told me
all about you.
Oh?
Yes. He said you were
roommates back in college.
Yes, we were.
Have a seat.
Anyway, my parents'
50th anniversary is coming up,
and I thought I'd surprise them
with a family reunion.
What a thoughtful son
you are.
So, uh, have you given
any thought to the venue?
Uh, yes. I have a summer place
up in Lake Pleasant.
Ah, pretty sure the terrace
fits eight tables of ten.
My, that's a nice little
terrace.
We, we will throw you
a party so special
that you'll want us to cater
your anniversary, too.
Uh, actually,
I'm not married.
Oh.
Well, let's talk about food.
With a new client,
what I usually do
is discuss possible menus,
and then I have
my very best chef
prepare a sample dinner.
"Sample dinner"?
We don't do sample dinners.
But this is
Orson's college roommate.
And...
he's quite the catch!
Oh, wait a minute.
Is this a setup?
Because I loathe blind dates.
Well, that's what's
so great about it.
Technically,
it's a business dinner.
It has all the potential upside
of a date
while still being
tax-deductible.
But I am not
going to get dressed up.
I'm not going to put on makeup,
and I am not going to flirt.
He came while Orson was out.
I let him record a message
on my phone.
Orson, sorry I missed you buddy.
Catch you next time, okay?
You realize you could have
just led with this
and saved us
this whole discussion?
Jeez, Roberta!
Put that damn thing out.
You're not in a corner saloon.
Then how come there's bourbon
in my coffee?
Do I have to call a nurse?
Fine. I drove 80 miles
to see you, Karen.
You better be dying,
or you're gonna pay for my gas.
I'm not dying, but there's
someone who sure wishes I was.
Son of a bitch
landed me in here.
You tell me where to find him.
I'll clean his damn clock.
No, we've got to be careful
with this guy.
Mm.
He's dangerous.
That's what you said
about that biker in Florida
who now has to puree
all his food.
Hmm, nearly forgot
about him.
That was a fun vacation.
So what do you need me
to do?
Let me come stay with you
when I get outta here.
This guy thinks
I'm out of commission,
And I want
to keep it that way.
And you can help me
do some digging.
You still work for
that cell phone company? The...
Teleshore. Yes, god help me.
Good. Pull his records
and see what turns up.
The name is
Dave Williams.
How do you know
he's with Teleshore?
I went through his mail.
God, you remind me of Mom.
So what else you need?
Could you
smuggle me in a cold brewski?
Boy, no one knows you
like family.
Jackson? It's me.
Hello?
That'll work.
Aah!
Aah! Aah!
Are you okay?
I think so.
Good.
So who the hell are you?
Darcy.
Who the hell are you?
Susan, Jackson's girlfriend.
He never said anything
about a girlfriend
when we hooked up at the club.
Well, when guys go out,
they tend not to play
the girlfriend card.
Did you just call me
a slut?!
You met the guy tonight.
Now you're in his shower.
I'm just doing the math.
Got the pizza.
Oh... crap.
So we break up,
and 15 minutes later
you're with someone else?
You got over me fast.
I'm surprised it took 15 minutes.
Stay out of this.
Susan, why are you here?
I wanted to talk
about our future.
You--you said
you didn't want a future.
Well, I was starting
to change my mind,
and then I show up
and find 5 feet of lip gloss
in the shower.
I brought hot wings.
You're not getting any.
Hi. What's that for?
Well, I was gonna use it to wash
down a bottle of sleeping pills
the next time
your husband's "band"
defiled another rock classic.
But since you got them
a rehearsal space,
I thought we could share it over ice.
Come on in.
Hey.
We're taking off.
Remember, I'm spending the night
at Kirby's house.
Oh, right. And, Kirby,
tell your mom thanks.
That place she found for Tom
is already paying off.
Yeah, she said she was
there yesterday
and said it was looking pretty cool.
Sh-she was there? Why?
She was just dropping off some
old furniture for Mr. Scavo--
A couple chairs,
lamp, futon.
Oh.
Well, see you tomorrow.
Okay. Drive safely.
Yeah.
Um... neat or rocks?
So why does Tom need a bed
in his rehearsal space?
Not a bed- a futon, like a couch.
That folds out to a bed.
What are you saying?
Well, if it's just a couch,
why didn't Tom tell you about it?
How do you know he didn't?
I don't. Did he?
No.
Well, good for you.
Good for you
for not worrying about
your husband's bachelor pad.
You are not the teeniest bit
paranoid, and I say brava.
Now why aren't we drinking?
Whoo-hoo-hoo!
Not bad! I mean,
we were really cookin' there.
Tom, you got any beer
in the fridge?
I got nothing but beer
in the fridge.
All right, everyone,
go grab a cold one.
You earned it.
You sounded great.
Oh, do we blow.
Oh, yeah.
Not you, though.
Man, you got the heart
of a real blues guy.
Ah, that's what five years
in prison'll do to ya.
Oh, yeah. I heard about that.
Still...
It's fun, isn't it?
Highlight of my week.
You know, uh...
I was thinking, maybe we should
bump up our rehearsal schedule,
you know, to start
working the kinks out.
Ah, twice a week's
about all I can handle.
What are you doing
that's more important than this?
Well, let's see.
My job, my son.
Uh... also, I just...
met this woman.
Oh, no, dude,
not blowing us off for a girl.
Buddy, I just started
seeing her, all right?
It's kind of important
for the whole "getting back
on the horse" thing.
Right, what about
Saturday afternoon?
I mean, come on, man.
We gotta do this.
Why? You're putting
a lot of time and effort
into a neighborhood
garage band.
Why is it such a big deal to you?
It's not.
I'm--I'm just having
a real good time.
All right, boys!
What do you say?
We gonna drink beer or we gonna
play some rock 'n' roll?
Tom, where are you?
Hey, babe, we just really
going to a groove at rehearsal,
and I think we're gonna play
for a couple more hours.
Yeah?
Anyway, I just wanna say
don't wait up for me.
And I will, um, I'll see you
in the morning, okay?
Okay. Bye.
Oh, my god.
Lynette!
You said you were
rehearsing.
I know. I know.
The guys--the guys left,
and I just figured I'd, uh...
hang out for a little bit.
Why can't you do that
at home?
What the hell is this?
You moving out on me?
Why would I move out?
So you can have
your affair--
You know, the one that
follows the sports car
and the garage band
and wanting
to quit your job,
the final stage
of your mid-life crisis.
Oh, and then...
when I hear Anne Schilling
has been dropping by--
Lynette! She had a bunch of old,
crappy furniture in her garage.
I bought it for 50 bucks.
You don't really think
that...
Okay...
These past few months,
when we've been fighting about
the car and the road trip,
part...
part of me thought that you were
just complaining to complain,
trying to ruin my fun.
But if it's affecting you
like this,
if it's making you
actually think
that I would hurt you
in that way,
I'm done with all of this.
So you'll come home?
Of course.
Let me just square
all this stuff away, okay?
And then I will see you there.
Good.
Maybe when you come home,
you could teach me
how to play that video game.
That'd be great.
Okay.
Hey, Clay.
Is Mr. Banks around?
Uh, he's not back
from lunch yet. What's up?
Oh, I need
to sweet-talk him
into giving Carlos
two months off.
Oh, you two going away somewhere?
No, just Carlos.
Mrs. Hildebrand
is taking him to Europe
as her personal
massage therapist.
Personal massage therapist?
Paying him a fortune.
But he's worth it.
I mean, what he's done
for that woman,
no one else
has been able to do.
So... he told you about that?
They both did.
You should have seen the woman,
looking at Carlos,
gushing like crazy.
And you're okay with them
going away together?
Why should I be jealous?
The woman's, like, 60.
If she gets off on Carlos'
magical touch, what do I care?
Yeah.
Well, you're broad-minded.
You know,
if my girlfriend knew
that my massages were
giving a woman orgasms,
no matter how
old she was--
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Nobody used the "O" word.
He didn't mention that?
No!
He's giving her orgasms?!
Nah, not deliberately!
Uh, he swears he's only been
doing his standard massage.
Oh, I bet he does!
Where is he? Is she here now?
Oh, no, no.
She prefers her place, so she's
been sending a car for him.
Where? Where does she live?
It's that big house
on the corner
of Lake and Pinehurst.
I'm sorry, Gaby.
Is there anything I can do?
Hm well, when the time comes,
an alibi would be nice.
We need to talk.
I have the mailman
upstairs in my tub.
You know what?
You have no right
to be mad at me.
I don't?
I try to commit to you,
and you push me away.
I try to move on,
and I'm a shallow jerk,
what the hell
are you doing?
Yeah, I have
been married twice,
and both times
that's imploded,
so really, I feel like...
love is not my friend.
You know, I-I wish that I could
say it was just rotten luck,
but...
I just am thinking that...
I can't do this.
You can't?
I-I never even had a real
girlfriend before I met you.
I didn't want one.
And the first time I try
to commit, bam! I get smacked.
Look, I don't even know
where we are anymore.
Wow.
We really messed this up,
didn't we?
Pretty much, yeah.
We just have
so much baggage.
I wish we could start over.
Can we start over?
Hello?
Hi.
Uh, is Susan Meyer there?
May I ask who's calling?
This is Jackson... Braddock.
Uh, we met once.
I don't know if you remember me.
I have brown hair.
Uh, yeah.
I think I remember you.
Well, anyway,
I thought we really clicked,
So I was wondering if you might
want to have dinner with me.
Okay.
When?
Tomorrow.
I know this great Mexican-
French place.
Sounds great.
Pick me up at 7:00.
Great.
Where do you live?
May I help you? Excuse me.
I am Gabrielle Solis.
Perhaps you know my husband?
He "rubs" your boss.
Where are they?
I am under strict instructions
not to disturb Mrs. Hildebrand.
You can wait here.
Fine.
When the cops
bust up this brothel,
I'm gonna tell them
you're the madame.
Mmm. Mmm, yes.
That's it, right there.
You sure
this isn't too rough?
Mmm. No way.
Go deeper. I can take it.
Ohh.
Mmm. Mmm.
I've got a crick. I...
Carlos, I just remembered
I had an important business call
to make.
Could you give me the room for a minute?
Absolutely.
Mrs. Solis,
what are you doing here?
I know what you've been up to,
and shame on you.
What are you talking about?
I know about...
the big "O."
Oh, dear. He could tell?
I'm beyond mortified.
I understand your concern,
but I assure you
it was only that one time.
It's never happened again.
And it never will,
because if you think
I'm gonna let you drag Carlos
off to Europe, you're nuts.
That a woman as young
and beautiful as you
should see me as a threat.
But it would be a shame
to let it end a friendship
that's come to mean
so much to me.
Maybe a little too much.
Mrs. Solis, my husband's gone.
I'm estranged from my family.
If you live with loneliness
long enough,
it becomes an ache inside you--
an actual physical pain.
I thought I'd live with
that pain the rest of my life.
Then your husband healed me.
Can you blame me
for being grateful?
No, but I just think
we should end things
before they get any weirder.
Carlos tells me you used
to be a fashion model.
I've always had a passion
for clothes.
The reason
I'm going to Europe is
yo see the couture collections
in Paris and Milan.
Lucky you.
It's not so much fun
going alone.
But if I had a knowledgeable
companion like you
to be my guide...
In fact, you could be
my personal shopper.
That is,
if you don't mind
being paid in dresses.
Gosh, that's a...
a hell of a sweet offer,
but I've... got the girls,
and, um...
We'll bring them along.
Think what fun we'll have
dressing them up.
What the hell? You're never
too young to see Paris, right?
I'm so glad!
I can see we're
going to be great friends.
Carlos!
I'm done with my call.
Hello!
Mm!
Hey, hon. Check this out.
If it's
the cat eating spaghetti,
I've already seen it.
It's our band logo.
We're thinking of getting
t-shirts made up.
"Blue Odyssey"?
Who came up with that?
This was the name
of my brother's band
when he was in high school.
You have a brother?
Had. He died.
Well, you never told me
about him.
What happened?
His name was Steve.
He was a great guy...
Just kinda got caught up
in drugs and couldn't get out.
He went to prison,
and when he was there,
was killed...
by another inmate.
And what happened
to the guy who killed him?
Oh, the court ruled it
self-defense,
so the guy finished his time,
and he got out.
I can't believe you've
never told me about him.
I mean, it might help you
to talk about stuff like that.
I have my own way
of dealing with it.
Oh sorry,  I'm late.
That rehearsal was awesome.
They're letting me sing
lead vocal
on "Hotel California."
Oh, that's nice.
Hey, was there
a blue convertible
parked in front of Katherine's?
Yes, there was. Nice one.
My god, he's still there.
Who's still there?
Well, Katherine's been lonely,
so I set her up with a client,
and he's been there
for over four hours,
so you know it's going well!
Good for you!
My clever little matchmaker.
Mmm.
Ohh. Mwah. Well, you
deserve some credit, too.
I mean, you brought us
Peter's business.
Peter? Peter Hickey?
Yes.
You set him up with Katherine?
Is that bad?
Potentially.
Is he gay?
Ugh! I knew he had
too much product in his hair.
No, it's just that when
I booked the anniversary party,
I didn't want you to be
uncomfortable around Peter,
so I said we'd met in college,
which is not actually the case.
Well, where did you meet?
Prison.
Peter's a felon?
But he's so refined,
so handsome.
Two qualities that did not
serve him well behind bars.
My god, Orson.
What kind of criminal is he?
A killer or a rapist?
Oh, no, no, no, nothing like that.
They got him
for organ trafficking.
What?!
He was a surgeon,
and it seems
that when the opportunity
presented itself,
he'd harvest
the odd liver or kidney
from a deceased patient
and then sell it on the black market.
Are you telling me
that I set Katherine up
with a convicted graverobber?!
Well, you said yourself,
women over 40
can only be so choosy.
That is not funny!
I have to go warn Katherine.
Hello?
Katherine, hi!
Is everything all right
over there?
Yes, everything's fine.
Then why are you whispering?
Peter just fell asleep.
I don't want to wake him.
Oh, my god.
You slept with him?
You can wag that finger
all you like.
I've got just six words
for you, Bree Hodge...
Thank you, thank you,
thank you!
Oh, I just really wish
you'd taken things more slowly.
Bree, you have given me
the most magical night I've had
since I don't know when.
Are you gonna make me
feel bad about it now?
Oh! He is just so wonderful.
I tell you, if I'm not careful,
this guy could steal my heart.
Well, if he tries,
just promise you'll call.
Sorry I'm late.
I was sleeping so soundly.
Peter didn't want
to wake me.
What's this?
A cosmopolitan.
That's your favorite, isn't it?
It's 10:00 A.M.
I don't want a drink.
You will.
But... these homeless people
whose kidneys he bought--
he at least paid them well,
right?
Oh, I am so, so sorry.
Oh, it's not your fault.
You didn't know.
I have no one but myself
to blame.
That's it.
I'm going to Maryland.
You can't just move
because of one bad date.
You don't get it.
When we started this, you were
justs lonely as I s--
Orson in jail, Benjy gone.
And I felt bad for you,
But, boy, was it nice to have
somebody in the same boat.
And then Orson got out,
and now he's here all the time.
And I feel like
you're this...
Fun, happy power couple,
and I'm just this needy,
pathetic idiot...
who hops into bed
with the first pancreas thief
who kisses her.
I should be with family.
and I'm not family?
Katherine, all my life,
I wanted a sister.
And now I feel like
I finally have one.
But we're always fighting
and competing with each other.
Well, what could be
more sisterly than that?
I know I'm not the most...
demonstrative... person,
but I care about you deeply,
and if you were
to just walk out of my life,
I would be very...
very unhappy.
Well, I wouldn't want that.
Good.
Well, now that that's settled...
Let's make some pies.
Okay.
No.
Hey, is Porter
still at Kirby's?
Yeah.
What's wrong with you?
You've been antsy all night.
Nothing. No, I'm fine.
I'm fine.
Okay, I know what it is.
I have had this nagging feeling
that I've forgotten something,
and then I just realized
I think I left the freezer
door at Scavo's open.
You sure?
No. That's why it's gonna
drive me crazy.
I better go down there
and check. Mmm.
Okay.
Hurry back.
I'm so glad you were able
to get away.
I didn't think
you'd make it.
Yeah.
I'm glad my parents still think
I'm young enough for sleepovers.
Crap! It's my dad!
Dad, hi.
I was just--I was just...
I know
what you were "just."
When I found this,
I thought,
oh, great!
One of the guys in the band
is having an affair.
And then it hit me--
Porter has a key.
Where is she?
Oh.
Dad.
Don't.
She isn't wearing anything,
all right?
Who is she?
Just some girl
from English class.
You--you don't know her.
I'm gonna
go in the bathroom.
You got 60 seconds
to get her out of here.
Oh. Hey, Mike.
Wow. Look at you
all dressed up.
Oh, I was, um,
kind of on a date.
Oh. How did it go?
Pretty bad.
Basically, she just grilled me
all through dinner--
what do I think about this?
What would I do if that?
I barely even know her.
I felt like I was on trial for my life.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I just wanted somebody nice
to have a cup of coffee with.
I guess
that's too much to ask.
Well, it's kinda late
for coffee, but...
I do have lemonade.
I'd settle for lemonade.
Hey, you know,
I know it seems
like I am being hard on you,
but like I told you before,
I don't think
I know. You said.
Just making sure
you heard me.
Mm-hmm.
Now go to bed.
It's late.
Mm.
Want me to, uh,
put the car cover on
for you first?
Sure. Thanks.
You shouldn't be here. Someone
might recognize your car.
Is everything okay?
Yeah. My dad
doesn't suspect anything.
I'm sorry if
I got you in any trouble.
It's okay. You're worth it.
There are dangerous women
in this world.
Some are lovers,
blind to the consequences
of their actions.
Some are wives
enraged by the betrayal
of those they trusted.
Others are predators,
deviously setting traps
to get what they want.
If you're unlucky enough
to come upon
one of these
dangerous creatures,
the safest thing to do...
I pulled those records
you asked for.
Looks like your Mr. Williams
is keeping a little secret.
is run the
other way.

Previously on Desperate Housewives
Can we start over?
It was a surprising day for the women of wisteria lane.
Well, I was wondering
If you might want to have dinner with me. Okay.
He's giving her orgasms?! Ah! Not deliberately.
I can see we're going to be great friends.
You are a vibrant, attractive woman, you--
Who hasn't had sex in two years. That spells "grandma" to me.
Let me come stay with you when I get outta here.
This guy thinks I'm out of commission,
And I want to keep it that way. What's wrong with you?
You've been antsy all night.
I think I left the freezer door at Scavo's open
But it was an even more surprising night...
Crap! It's my dad! For the Scavos.
Where is she? Don't. She isn't wearing anything, all right?
Who is she? Just some girl from english class.
I'm gonna go in the bathroom.
You got 60 seconds to get her out of here.
That same night
Five minutes later
There was a slight misunderstanding
In the Scavo house that night.
You see, someone in the family
Was having an affair with a married wom,
And Lynette Scavo suspected her husband.
False alarm. The freezer was shut tight.
Unfortunately for Lynette, she was wrong.
Liar.
What? I always knew things could change between us, tom,
But no matter what,
The one thing I always thought I'd get is your respect.
Lynette, what's going on?
I followed you to the warehouse. I know everything.
Oh, boy.
Yeah, at this point,
I think I'm gonna need a little bit more than that.
You're right. I shouldn't have kept this from you.
And...
You know, for what it's worth, I wanted to bring you in on it. Huh?
But I was afraid you'd overreact.
That's what you were afraid of?
Hey, I'm upset, too.
But let's face it. Boys will be boys.
I think... I have to sit down now.
Lynette, are you really surprised?
It's not the first time this has happened.
And it definitely won't be the last.
You know what? I have to kill you now. Well, he's your son, too.
Who? Porter!
What are you talking about? I found out
Porter's been hooking up with some girl at our warehouse.
What are you talking about?
And just like that,
The slight misunderstanding in the Scavo house had ended...
Hey. What's up?
You're having sex with your best friend's mother?!
And a huge family crisis
Had begun.

Desire...It's an emotion designed to lead us astray,
Causing us to buy things we can't afford...
Encouraging us to sample desserts
We don't need...
And pushing us into love affairs
We're clearly not ready for.
I want you to call that woman
And tell her you are never seeing her again.
Her name is Anne.
Her name is Mrs. Schilling.
She was your T-ball coach when you were 6.
By the way, does your best friend know
You're sleeping with his mother?
We're keeping our relationship from Kirby for now.
This isn't a relationship.
You are being used by this woman.
No, I'm not. I love her.
Okay, that's it. I'm calling her.
No.
Hey! What if her husband answers?
Gee, Porter.
That's just one of the pitfalls of dating a married woman.
Listen to me! Mr. Schilling can't find out.
He--he's totally violent. He--he would kill her.
Well, then you have put her in a very dangerous position,
Haven't you?
Okay. I'll call her. I'll tell her it's over.
I'm not going to say that you know.
That'll just freak her out. But you have to promise me
That you won't say anything to her psycho husband.
I am not promising anything. So help me, if I find out
That you do something, and she gets hurt,
I will leave this house and I will never
Come back! Oh, please! You would never do that
Yeah? Well, I-I've done a lot of things
You never thought I would do.
Wait.
We won't say anything.
But if you don't end this, you won't have to leave.
We will throw you out.
So... You wanted to see me?
Sit.
Tell us, charlie...
Have you enjoyed working here at Mrs. Van De Kamp's?
Yeah. It's great.
You don't feel you've been underpaid? No.
Well, then perhaps you can explain
Why you stole $200 from the petty cash box yesterday.
What? I didn't steal anything.
Charlie, we wouldn't accuse you unless we had concrete evidence,
And thanks to my diligent partner here, we do.
So am I, like... Fired?
You're more than "like" fired.
You're fired. And, of course, we want our money back.
Uh, I don't have have it. I spent it.
Well, then I suggest you return your purchase.
Do you have a receipt?
Yeah. Yeah, like pot dealers give receipts.
Well, you've just covered yourself in glory on this one.
Just... Please, don't tell my parents.
I'll get you the money. I promise.
Can you believe it? A thief and a pothead!
Well, at least we know now
Where the 2 pounds of cookie dough went.
Too many?
Yeah. I gotta have one more. Ah!
Thank you for doing this.
Ah, well... We needed to wipe the slate clean, right?
Mm. And honestly?
This is the best second first date I've ever had.
Isn't it?
And knowing we're not gonna have sex
Takes all the pressure off.
That's... Something we know?
Yes.
We're starting completely over,
So this time, we're gonna do things right.
W-which means what?
Well, it means...
No sex until at least date four.
Ah. I want us to spend this time
Really getting to know each other.
I-i do know you. What's my least favorite word?
"phlegm."
You're just guessing.
It's "panties."
Ohh. Although some days it's "larva" or "chunks."
Well, I will try to remember that.
Mm. Now you tell me something I don't know about you.
Okay.
I'm a painter.
I sort of guessed that when you painted my house.
I mean, I paint... Art.
Like... On a canvas, in a frame.
Seriously?
I went to art school in paris.
And my professor had a beret, so you know he was good.
So now you're painting... My bathroom?
Yeah.
It sucks.
But I've been blocked for the past year.
Blocked? Yeah.
I mean, I keep trying to start new pieces, but...
Nothing comes. It's... Driving me crazy.
Well, I'm sorry things aren't going well.
But I'm glad you told me.
See? We're getting to know each other.
And we wouldn't have if we'd spent the whole night in bed.
And now I'm creatively and sexually frustrated.
First dates are awesome.
Jeez, roberta, I know you hate to throw anything away,
But do you have the garbagemen bringing you stuff now?
Pardon my french, but what's french for "kiss my ass"?
So you said dave has a secret.
Now how you gettin' that from this?
It's just a bunch of phone numbers. Yeah,
It may be just a bunch of numbers to you
But to a savvy sleuth with a keen eye
And the nose of a bloodhound- yeah,
Yeah, you're miss marple with a bum liver
So what's he hiding?
Let me walk you through it. Around the 1st of every month,
Dave gets a string of calls- five or six--
From this number in Boston.
They're all short- 10, 15 seconds.
My guess is he's not picking up.
Somebody's leaving him messages. You know, buggin' him. Once a month, huh?
My guess is it's an ex-wife looking for her alimony.
Except it's not. You see this?
After a few days, he always calls back.
And who, you ask, is he calling?
A hospital in Boston.
It's the office of Dr. Samuel Heller...
Psychiatrist.
So... Once a month,
Dave whines about his life
To a beantown headshrinker, huh?
Big whoop.
I looked up your davey's doc on the web.
He's not your garden-variety shrink.
He's a renowned psychiatrist and published author
With a very specialized field of expertise.
And that, my dear Watson,
Is your neighbor's little secret.
Treating the criminally insane
Oh, lap of luxury,
Hoi've missed sitting in you.
Celia! Juanita!
Chef is taking fresh-baked cookies out of the oven.
You're not gonna catch me!
Oh, I can't tell you how nice it is
To hear the sound of children's laughter in this house.
You know what I was thinking?
Why don't you all stay the weekend?
Ooh, we'd love to. Jeez, we can't.
Why not? Celia's birthday party is sunday.
We've gotta get ready for it, remember?
What's to get ready? You buy a $9 sheet cake
And fling a piata over a tree and bam! Party time.
But I don't have a change of clothes.
My nephew left a whole closet full of old clothes.
I'm sure something will fit you.
Well... Carlos, just nod your head,
'cause I ain't leaving this pool. Oh, good. It's settled.
Oh, gaby. Your margarita's getting low.
I'll send brandon out with a fresh one.
Thank you.
What are you doing?
What? You heard the woman. She wants children's laughter.
And I want the lobster the chef is serving for dinner.
It's a win-win. I just don't feel comfortable with this.
Why not?
I mean, look at this place. It's like shangri-la.
Wow, you're right. The pitch black I see here
Is much more dazzling than the one at home.
What is your problem?
My problem is that it's a bad idea
To mix business and pleasure.
Says the man who massaged her into an orgasm.
Even more reason to keep some professional distance.
Carlos, she is just a lonely old woman
Yearning for some friendship and human contact.
And i, for one, am happy to be that human.
Mrs. Solis? Your margarita.
Oh, shoot. I can't reach it.
Hey, guys. Sorry I'm late.
Hey. You bring beer?
Was I supposed to? No. Tom was supposed to.
Gosh. Sorry. I thought the two cases I bought monday
Would've lasted more than one rehearsal.
Boys, we're better off not drinking today.
We've got a lot of work to do and only one week to do it.
What are you talking about?
We are playing
Battle of the bands at the white horse!
Uh, dave? Battle of the bands isn't for amateurs.
You gotta audition.
Uh, we don't.
Edie's got a real estate buddy whose husband owns the club.
You're kidding. We're playing an actual gig?
In front of people who aren't listening
Just because I pay their allowance? Well, this is fantastic!
Yes! But that means the pressure's on.
We gotta really rehearse our cover stuff
And... We need an original song.
I don't know anything about songwriting.
I-i know a little bit. No, you don't.
It's fine. Mike and I will write something.
You got a little time later? Not tonight. I got plans.
"plans
What's her name?
Can we just rehearse, please?
You know, I heard that susan and jackson
Broke up. I heard they got back together
It's not susan. Stop guessing.
Also, get lives.
Whatever, mike,
Just so long as you're having fun.
Hey! Who said you- turn the board around.
Get back here. No! Come out here and show me some moves!
Sorry to bother you.
Just wanted to see if you needed anything before I go off to bed.
No, we're good. Sure you don't want to order margarita number 12?
You sure you don't want to shut your piehole?
It's so cute, how you two bicker.
Carlos, how do those pajamas fit you?
They're perfect.
I-i hope your nephew doesn't mind that I was wearing 'em.
He'll never know. We're estranged.
Oh. Okay.
Anyway, we're good. So have a nice night.
Oh! What's that?
Some animated thing.
I love animated movies.
The girls wanted to watch it,
So we're kind of having a family movie night.
Ooh, that sounds like fun!
My heavens, is that penguin surfing?
Gee, I don't know. I can't really see the screen anymore.
Oh, dear. I'm being rude.
Oh, that's okay.
There. That's better.
Did she just crawl under... Oh, yeah.
And so there I was in ninth grade,
And my boobs had not made an appearance.
I was desperate.
Here. Let me refill that for you.
And so that's when I got caught stuffing
At the pep rally.
And six months later... Kaboom.
I was voted prom queen. Nice work, girls.
Stop that right now.
What?
The sex music. Turn it off.
That--that's not sex music.
We are not having sex until date number four,
And this is date number two.
I know what it is.
It--it's just that you look so hot in these pants,
And your hair smells so good.
And your eyes...
Look, I made you dinner. Come on.
Jackson- I braised beef for you.
Do you know what a pain in the ass it is to braise meat?
Okay, do you know how sad it makes me
To know that you only braised it to boink me?
You're supposed to be asking me questions.
The point of all this was to get to know each other better.
How is it gonna make our relationship stronger
For me to know that in the fifth grade,
They sent you to the therapist
'cause you wouldn't stop chewing your hair?
You know, that was hard for me to share,
And the fact that you just make light of it...
No, I'm am calling the second date officially over.
And you know what?
I was going to let you feel me up over my blouse.
But now? Nada.
So before we wrap up here,
We still need some chaperones for the junior prom.
Anne Schilling is coordinating the volunteers,
And she could really use some help.
Nobody?
I know we're all busy,
But this is important.
We want our kids to have fun, but let's face it.
If we don't keep an eye on them,
God only knows what kind of trouble they'll get into.
Helen?
Marjorie? You'll help?
Fantastic. Thanks, guys.
Hey, Lynette.
Do these meetings keep getting longer,
Or do they just seem that way?
I don't know.
So...
How's the family?
I haven't seen penny in so long,
And all the kids are getting so big now.
I guess the boys will be going off to clege soon.
Aah! Lynette!
I know everything, okay?
Ok...
I'm sorry, but...
It's important for you to understand...
I love Porter.
So do i.
And if you ever lay a hand on him again,
You will find out just how much.
Oh, bree. I've got good news.
Me, too. You go first.
I hired a girl to replace that thief charlie.
Oh. Well, are you sure she's trustworthy?
Well, she comes with a strong recommendation
From the head of the local f.B.I. Office--
Her father, who's mormon.
Well done, orson!
Thank you. Your turn.
"the new christian reader" just published
An advance review of my cookbook. Listen!
"Mrs. Van De Kamp's colorful stories of her upbringing
"show her upstanding values,
But her recipes are sinfully delicious."
They gave me four halos!
Then I think this is appropriate--
Holy cow!
I have to admit,
I had some reservations about us working together,
But this has succeeded beyond my wildest dreams.
Mmm. We're quite a team, aren't we?
Yeah, and the best part is
We get to see each other all the time.
Mm-hmm, I know, which makes the hardest part
Keeping my hands off you all the time.
Orson!
You can't be serious! Here?
This kitchen is the birthplace of our triumphs.
What better place to celebrate them, hmm?
Ooh! Oh, this counter's hard on my head.
Do you want me to stop?
No. Get me an oven mitt.
Right.
Oh, much better.
Rise and shine, girls.
Rise and shi--
Oh, my god!
What are you doing?!
Gaby, it's fine. We're just doing a little art project.
I told the the girls
They could decorate the room any way they wanted.
I'm making a castle.
It's stupid.
No, you're stupid!
You're both stupid. Stop it!
Um, Mrs. Hildebrand, this is really nice of you.
But why would you want to ruin your beautiful room?
Oh, it's not my room anymore. It's their room.
What?
Yes. It's the room they'll be staying in
Whenever you come to visit.
They're getting a new tv, bunk beds.
I'll have it ready by the time you get here next weekend.
Uh... Next weekend, uh,
Carlos and I have plans.
Well, I bet the girls don't. I'll send a car for them.
I... Don't think
That's such a good idea.
How about it, girls? Wanna spend next weekend here? Yay!
Yay! Thank you. Mrs. Hildebrand.
Oh! Oh! What did I tell you?
Sorry. Thank you, grandma.
Oh, come!
"grandma"? She told them to call her "grandma"?
Yeah, and that's why we're leaving.
After you told her you'd stay all weekend?
How we gonna do that? I don't know. Make an excuse.
Say you ha some blind thing you have to go to.
We have to be very careful here.
This woman has a lot of pull at the country club.
Plus, we've got that europe trip coming up. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
We're not going to europe with grandma
Nutjob. I'm not walking away from $100,000
We need that money. Carlos, it's not worth it.
She's really starting to freak me out. Damn it, gaby.
I told you it was dangerous getting chummy with the clients.
You wouldn't listen. You had to stay for the lobster.
Hey, I seem to remember some melted butter on your bib, too.
Now how we getting out of here?
Look, she knows we've got celia's party tomorrow.
I'll tell her we have to go shopping for that.
Everything will be fine.
Sorry.
I had to wait for my folks to go to the store
Before I could sneak out. What's wrong?
Are you okay?
I don't know what to do.
About what? Let me help you.
It's just all such a mess.
Wait. Is this about my mom?
Did she do something else to you?
Did she call your husband? No.
Well, then what? Tell me.
I'm pregnant.
Hey,o you mind if I cut out early today?
I don't see why not.
I mean, everything's, uh, pretty much done here.
You can go now if you like. Thanks.
Andrew. Don't you look handsome?
Do i? Great.
Something wrong?
You remember charlie, the kid you guys fired for stealing?
Well, he called and asked how you could prove it,
And I said, "we've got a surveillance tape, scuzzball."
Well, uh, guess who stole
The surveillance tape last night.
That does it. We're pressing charges.
Uh, you--you might want to hold off on that,
Because according to charlie,
The surveillance tape is also a sex tape.
What?
Yeah, he said it shows a couple really going at it.
So...
Any idea who those crazy kids might be?
Oh, dear god.
Yep. Kinda thought so.
How could this be happening?
Before anything got serious,
I made a point of turning the camera off.
Wait, I turned it off, too. I didn't see you do that.
No, you were looking for the olive oil.
Obviously, you turned it back on.
We need to, um, get that tape back.
Yeah, well, break out your checkbook,
'cause he wants 2 grand for it. $2,000?!
Yeah, or he's gonna post it on youtube.
What are we gonna do? Well, first you need to decide
What your porn names are gonna be.
Okay, this is not a joke. My book comes out next month--
My old-fashioned, traditional cookbook!
This could ruin me!
All right, bree. We'll just pay him.
No! I-i refuse to pay blackmail to some hooligan
Who's stolen from us twice!
Andrew...
All my life, I have done my best to teach you
To respect god and the law
And never to harm another living thing.
I want you to forget every one of those lessons
If it'll help you get that tape back.
So... Carte blanche?
Uh... Within reason.
We are not condoning arson or violence or--
Orson, don't cramp the boy's style.
Hey, sweetie. Now don't forget to make a wish.
Happy birthday!
Happy birthday.
Virginia! What, uh, are you doing here?
I came to give celia her birthday gift.
Well, she's a little busy with her friends right now,
So just give it to me, and I'll make sure she gets it.
I'm afraid that won't be possible.
You see, for my present, I'm gonna take her to a shop
That sells the most exquisite antique dolls
And let her pick whichever one she likes.
Well, she's not gonna leave her party to go buy a doll.
Well, of course not. I'll wait on the porch till it's over.
Uh, look, I'm sorry,
But I don't want you driving off with my daughter.
Well, you know she'll be safe with me.
But if you'd feel better joining us...
You sure are making this hard.
I have tried to be nice, but I am running out of polite here,
So I'm just gonna say knock it off.
I'm sorry. Knock off what?
This whole creepy, clingy "i'm your grandma" routine.
But I've come to feel like a grandmother to the girls.
In three days. That's the creepy part.
What a hurtful thing to say,
Especially given how generous I've been to your family.
Yeah, too generous.
It's like you're trying to buy us or something.
Well, we're not for sale, so just back off!
Who do you think you're talking to?
You wicked, ungrateful girl!
You're not the first greedy bitch
Who's tried to bleed me dry and then wash her hands of me.
Okay, we're done here. Good-bye.
Am I not making myself clear? Get off my property!
Gaby.
What's going on?
I came to buy celia a doll.
I believe you've heard gaby's response.
Virginia, please.
Allow me to apologize.
I think it's a little late for that.
Thank you...
For a wonderful third date.
And I'm glad that you're back on board with our plan.
Yeah, I really think
I'm starting to get something out of it.
Mmm. Oh, pop quiz!
Why did kim beale stop talking to me in eighth grade?
Well, you told erin connors about her nose job. Right!
What time is it?
Uh, 10:48?
No. It's sex time!
Hey. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, susan.
What?! Stop.
We're not having sex till the fourth date, remember?
Jackson, look at me.
I'm tipsy. I'm horny.
I'm easier than a 5-year-old's homework.
I'll call you tomorrow.
The forehead?
I hate to say anything, stan,
But you are president of the country club.
You need to know
That the way carlos touched me during my last massage...
Well, let's just say it was highly inappropriate.
And that kind of behavior
Is a liability the club can't afford.
Good.
I appreciate your taking care of it.
Hello? Uh, hello. Is this Dr. Heller?
Speaking. Who's calling? I'm maggie carr at hilltop insurance.
We have an applicant
For a new term life insurance policy,
And he lists you as a previous care provider.
I was hoping to verify his medical history.
The name's dave williams.
Dave williams? I don't know a dave williams.
Well, sure you do. You call him every month.
How would maggie know that?! Uh, I'm guessing.
Who is this?
Uh, hi, Dr. Heller.
I'm, uh, lindsay thorne. I'm maggie's supervisor.
And she's confused and about to get fired.
And, uh, we just need you to confirm for our records
That you're treating a man named david williams.
What is your medicare i.D. Number?
Um... I'm not sure.
We're in the process of converting to the metric system.
I don't know who this is,
But are you aware that what you are doing is illegal?
Okay, look. We're just trying to get some info on this guy.
He just moved to fairview,
And he's really creeping people out.
You're in fairview?
Yeah. Why? Does that mean something to ya?
No, I'm just trying to get all the info I need
When I contact the federal authorities
To let them know that--
Well, we really screwed the pooch on that one.
Yeah, back to the drawing board.
Can I irish that up for ya?
It's noon somewhere.
You got the tape! How did you manage that?
Orson, we don't need to know.
No, you don't, but it's kind of amazing
What you can get a bunch of bikers to do for a case of beer.
Oh, my. Well, I better destroy this.
Actually, you may want to watch it first.
Why? I'm embarrassed enough as it is.
Humor me. I'll cue it up.
You watched it?! Well, I had to make sure it was the right disk.
Here, just watch a little bit.
Oh, dear god. I can't look.
Really, andrew.
Wait. Bree, that's not us.
What? Well, who is it then?
Wait, wait. He flips her in just a sec.
This is where it gets good.
Katherine!
And mike.
Just so you know, I'm--i'm never eating anything
That comesut of that kitchen again.
Jackson?
I am declari this
Our official fourth date, okay?
The rules have been followed,
And you may begin disrobing...
Now.
Uh, I'm--i'm--i'm--i'm kind of doing something right now.
Okay, I just ran into your house half-naked.
The only thing you should be doing is me.
What is on your face?
Is that paint?
Are you painting again?
Uh, y-yeah.
I thought you were blocked.
I was, but, uh...
Not having sex for a few days
Kinda got my juices flowing in a different direction.
So now I-I really need to finish, so--
So you've broken through your creative logjam?
Congratulations!
Ooh, why not celebrate
By ripping off my clothes with your teeth?
I... Can't. I'm not finished yet.
How close are you? 'cause I can wait.
Wait, wait, no. No, don't- don't look at that... Yet.
That's me.
Yeah. Uh, it's...
Supposed to be.
That look on my face...
I've seen  before...
In the mirror, when I'm feeling...
How do you know about that look?
I-i know a lot about you.
I know your cheeks get red when people say you're pretty.
I know that your eyes start to tear up
Whenever you talk about your grandfather.
And I know that when you're really sad,
You get that beautiful, haunted look
That you try to shake off before anybody can see it.
I can't believe I ever thought you didn't know me.
Well, I guess I should let you finish this.
I'm sort of missing hands.
Actually, that is one detail I could use some help with.
Really?
Unless you have a problem posing naked.
Oh. Come on.
I think you know the answer to that.
Hello, katherine.
Um, I thought you might want this videota...
From our surveillance camera.
We have a surveillance camera?
Yes, in the, uh, test kitchen.
Oh, my god.
So that means you saw me and...
Mike. Yes, indeedy.
Oh, I'm so embarrassed!
Oh, what you must think of me!
Let's not dwell on it. Oh! I mean, having sex in the kitchen,
Where food's prepared...
What kind of a demented slut would do that?
I said... Let's not dwell on it.
Thanks for bringing it by.
Katherine, I'm sorry, but I just have to ask--
Are you sure you know what you're doing? Meaning what?
Meaning susan is your oldest friend on this street.
She divorced him, bree, and she's seeing someone else.
Why can't mike do that?
Because she's your friend, and we're women.
We don't do that to each other.
Look...
I've been alone for five years.
I'm finally in a relationship,
And you're trying to make me feel guilty?
Is that what I saw on the tape- a relationship?
I don't know what it is.
All I know is...
I'm having the time of my life.
Fair enough. But just be careful,
I mean, this is very complicated.
I'd hate to see it end badly.
Hey, breakfast's on the table.
Porter, this whole hating me thing
That you've got going on right now--
Believe it or not, I get where you're coming from.
I don't hate you.
But one day,
You are gonna meet someone more...
Appropriate.
Someone who want the same things that you do out of life.
Then you are gonna know what real love is.
And when you do, I hope you will finally see
Where I am coming from.
It's me. Can you talk?
Hey, gary. I'm running kind of late. Can I call you later?
Just listen.
I can leave town saturday.
You have the money, right?
Yeah. No problem.
I love you.
I know where you're coming from, mom.
And...
I-i want you and dad to know
That I really appreciate everything you've done for me.
Good.
I'll see you downstairs.
Desire--
It's an emotion designed to lead us astray,
Persuading those who crave love to make foolish choices...
Causing those who yearn for family
To act out in anger...
Allowing those who are lonely...
To behave in reckless ways.
And when the pursuit of our heart's desire
Becomes an obsession,
The best we can hope for
Is a caring friend willing to come along...
Hi. I'd like to book the next flight to fairview.
And stop us.
Previously on Desperate Housewives...
I love you.
You're having sex with
your best friend's mother?
An affair was revealed.
You have to promise me that you won't
say anything to her psycho husband.
A good time was brought to an end.
Back off!
Who do you think you're tking to?
We're done here. Good-bye.
And a man's past was uncovered.
Look,we're just trying to
get some info on this guy.
He just moved to fairview, and
he's really creeping people out.
You're in fairview?
Yeah,why? Does that
mean something to ya?
Once a year, the owner
of the white horse bar
would host a competition known
as the battle of the bands.
Give it up for cold splash.
And young musicians would come...
With their drums...
And guitars...
And dreams of stardom.
This year, those young musicians were
joined by a group of middle-aged men
Who came with their stiff joints...
And high cholesterol...
And dreams of being young
again, if only for one night.
god,look at those guys.
They'rso young.
No wonder they went first.
They probably have homework.
Would you guys relax?
Rock 'n' roll's not
just for young people.
Why are they so loud?
Not helping,carlos.
They're really good, and we're
really old enough to be their fathers.
Okay,we may look a little old up there,
and we may hit a few clams, but who cares?
We're here to have fun.
Yeah,tonight we're not the plumber and
a masseur and a guy that makes pizzas.
We're a rock 'n' roll band.
Right,Dave?
Absolutely.
Look,i've gotta check with
the guy about the light cues.
You're sure we're not
gonna humiliate ourselves?
I promise you it'll
be a night to remember.
and it was...
* Mustang sally *
* guess you better slow
your mustang down ...*
In ways they could never have known.
oh,my god! Fire!
It's locked.

Desperate
Housewives Season05 Episode08</font>
The next morning, news of
the tragedy began to spread...
Along with rumors that the
blaze had been set intentionally.
It wasn't long before the police
began using the word "arson"...
And someone was taken into custody.
The Day Before
Look at my little girl.
Isn't she adorable?
Oh,i missed her so much.
Oh,i can't wait to meet her.
Oh,not yet.
I wanna give her new
boyfriend the once-over.
He's as cute as she said- nice
smile, and look at that hair.
Don't you just wanna run
your fingers through it?
Fortunately for you,no.
You know, i'm very good
at first impressions.
I'm gonna like this guy.
Why is the cab driver handing
Julie's boyfriend money?
Why is Julie's boyfriend
getting back in the cab?
And why is the middle-aged
cab driver kissing Julie?
I think what's
goingn is--
i know what's going on.
Let me enjoy my denial.
Honey,i'm home.
You wouldn't believe the traffic...
Hello,gabrielle.
Virginia came by to say hello.
Isn't that a nice surprise?
I have news i wanted to share.
You don't seem happy to see me.
Well,maybe that's because
the last time we spoke,
You called me a greedy bitch
and i called you a scary old hag.
Weren't we a fine pair of hotheads?
But what family doesn't
have its squabbles?
Family? Lady,you had carlos fired.
That was a terrible misunderstanding.
And she straightened it
out, and i got my job back.
Isn'tthatnice?
Delightful.
Now leave before there's a terrible
misunderstanding between my foot and your ass.
Gaby,could i see you
in the kitchen... Now?
Save your breath,carlos.
There is no way we're letting grandma
screw-loose back into our lives.
She put us in her will.
Oh,my god! That woman is crazy.
Is she crazy or just desperately lonely?
I don't care.
All she wants is
some human contact--
To hang out with us on the occasional
weekend, maybe a holiday or two.
Right,and in exchange, when she finally
kicks the bucket, we wind up with a lamp.
I'm sorry,carlos.
We're the sole heirs
of her entire fortune.
And her blood pressure is 220/90.
Virginia! Why can't i stay mad at you?
All right,then, we'll see you soon.
The reporter's almost
here. I am so nervous.
Why? You've done lots of interviews.
That w all local. This is
"the new york dispatch."
if this goes well,my cookbook could be on
the front page of their weekend style section.
Katherine,what did you do to your hair?
I've never seen it look
so thick and lustrous.
I'm already planning to
say nice things about you.
Good. I can check that off my list.
When's the reporter coming?
Any minute.
Oh,my gosh,andrew. Don't
you look sharp today?
Don't worry. I-i
won't tell her i'm gay.
Check and check.
Mom,do you ow anything
about this reporter?
Only that her name is sandra birch.
We just spoke, and she seemed very nice.
She isn't.
I went online and pulled a bunch of her articles,
and a lot of them are complete hatchet jobs.
"a deeper look suggests something
darker,something more ominous,
A woman whose perky surface conceals a
deep,almost demonic thirst for power."
I doubt betty white saw that coming.
Mom,if this woman tanks you,
i could kill sales of the book.
You're gonna have to figure
out a way to handlthis.
Knock,knock?
I'm looking for Bree.
You must be sandra.
What a sharp outfit.
And look at that hair--
So thick and lustrous.
Mom, you got a minute?
I do.
Why do i have a sense you're
gonna take it away from me?
Porter got anne schilling pregnant.
Mom,are you okay?
Oh,yeah,i'm great. That it?
No. There's more. They're
planning to run away.
Okay. Well,your minute's up.
Aren't you gonna go talk to him?
No,i have to talk to someone else first.
Remember when you left that
soda can on the coffee table,
And it left a ring, and i yelled at you?
I take it all back.
And we always sell out, so i
want the band there by 6:00.
Any questions?
Sounds good.
When are we on?
Second.
You got the primo spot
as a favor to my wife.
Since she rented you the space,
she feels like part of the band.
Well,rock on,anne schilling.
If she requests "free
bird," we're doing it.
Hey,uh,tom,i saw porter
at my house the other day.
Yeah,he and kirby were shooting hoops.
I can't believe how big he's getting.
Yeah.
They grow up fast,huh?
Yeah. Little too fast.
Yeah.
uh,hey,doc, i know i
owe you a phone call.
I'm gonna cut to the chase, Dave.
Are you in fairview?
What? Where did that come from?
Doesn't matter where it came from.
Are you in fairview?
Look,i don't know what brought this
on, but i'm really busy right now.
I'll call you tomorrow. I promise.
And we can talk about it then.
Okay? Bye.
Excuse me.
So they were,huddled under this broken
umbrella, and... He just kissed me.
It was so romantic.
She's skipping the part where one
of the spokes got me in the eye.
Julie,i'm gonna take your
suitcases upstairs now,okay?
Oh,i'll come with you. I
need to check my e-mail.
Be right back.
So,Susan,i'm...
I'm sensing that,uh, you're a
little freaked out about my age.
You know,when your 24-year-old daughter calls you
and tells you she's bringing home a boy from college,
You sort of expect it
to be,well... A boy.
Well,i just want you to know that we didn't
srt dating until after the semester was over.
I don't date students.
That's--that's a rule with me.
And a damn good one.
Although strictly speaking, i suppose
my third wife wasmy teaching assistant,
But she was really more of
my employee than my student.
Your what?
Student.
Before that.
Employee.
Beforethat.
Third wife.
That's the one.
So you've been married three times?
Didn't Julie tell you that?
I don't believe so.
Although i may have blacked out
after she told me you were 40.
So how does a man your age get
married and divorced three times?
Well,my first wife and i were
only married a few months,
So i-i almost don't like to count it.
Did someone throw rice at you?
Yeah.
It counts.
Is this upsetting you? I-i
thought you'd understand.
Julie said you'd been divorced yourself.
Yeah. Only twice.
Two. Small number.
Much smaller than three.
And my first cheated on me,
so that doesn't even count.
Did someone throw rice at you?
Shut up.
Look,you and i both know that
sometimes it just doesn't work out.
Well... That's true.
And besides,it--it's different
with Julie. I love her so much.
It's very important that you know
i take my commitments seriously.
Why?
Oh,my god.
Lloyd,come here. I can't
find my cell phone charger.
Please,please, don't say anything.
I want it to be a surprise.
Thanks... Mom.
And this is my own little kitchen.
I'm pretty sure my
husband's here somewhere.
Orson,dear, are you decent?
In here,love.
Nice to meet you.
I've had the most delightful
time with your wife and stepson.
Your home is stunning.
You cannot run a business
and do all this,too.
Tell me you have a housekeeper.
Why would i y someone to do
work that gives me such joy?
Now who wants a little snack?
Bree,the idea was for me to
spend atypicalday with you.
So this is legit?
You're really this donna
reed housewife from the '50s?
You say that like it's a bad thing.
I think that decade had
a lot to recommend it.
Mm, people had values then- values
this family strives to uphold.
But not everyone can keep a
perfect house for a perfect family
with perfect food and perfect flowers.
Of course they can...
If they read my book,that is.
Okay,truth be told...
I'm far from perfect.
Only yesterday,i burned
a whole tray of biscotti.
And to think,i was worried
about finding a lead.
Andrew,please. The machine can get it.
We never answer the
phone while entertaining.
So rude to one's guests.
Now,um,may i pour you some more tea?
This is mr. Jones for Orson Hodge.
Due to vacation schedules, i'll be
filling in for your parole officer.
Give me a call,please.
So,mr. Hodge... You've been to prison.
Nowcan i be gay?
Kirby,is that you?
I thought you went to the movies.
Are you really pregnant?
Yes.
A couple of months back, warren and i...
W-we fought.
I was pretty banged
up, and--and...
Porter came by looking
for kirby, and--and...
He was so... Kind and...
And gentle.
Don't.
Don't try and justify
this. This is sick.
You are sick.
Your son... Loves me.
And--and
i love him.
And--and--and
you know what?
I'm glad i'm having porter's baby.
Damn.
Not exactly what a husband
wants to hear coming in the door.
I suppose dinner's not ready,either.
Warren,i'm
sorry that--
thank you.
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.
Don't go.
I need to talk with my wife right now.
I'm sorry for any pain this has
caused your family, mrs. Scavo.
Damn it.
You think you can humiliate
me? You piece of filth!
Get off of her! Get off of
her! I'm calling the police!
Stay out of this!
Okay,well,just so you know, i hit back.
Call the police.
I'd love to hear her explain
her way out of statutory rape.
You don't live here anymore.
Oh,my god! Oh,my god!
Thank you for coming back.
Here we are,boys! Are
you psyched or what?
Oh,i feel like i'm gonna puke again.
You guys cold splash?
Yes,sir.
"sir"?
We're blue odyssey.
Yeah,i can see that.
Uh,so after the gig, we're having
a party at our manager's loft.
You guys should come.
Abso-tively.
We just gotta check with our wives.
Why were you talking to that woman?
She just walked up and asked if we knew
you, wanted us to confirm a bunch of rumors.
What kind of rumors?
Just... Stuff she'd heard
around the neighborhood.
Were you really a boozehound?
Lee...
No,i'm just saying,i wish
i'd have known you then.
We'd have been such good friends.
She seemed to know an
awful lot about you.
Key
word--"awful."
I cannot let this happen.
I have to find her.
Well,she's gonna be at the
battle of the bands tonight.
Why?
She wants to hear Orson, and i quote, "sing
harmony with the guy he tried to kill."
Oh,dear god. This woman is determined to make my
life sound ten times worse than it actually is.
Yeah. So was your first husband
really into s and m hookers?
And you wonder why we're
never invited anywhere.
Okay,girls, mommy's leaving. I love you!
I'm planning on having a
massive hangover tomorrow,
so keep the girls up late
so we can all sleep in.
My,don't you look festive.
Virginia.
What are you doing here?
What do you mean? We're going
to watch carlos' band play.
You invited me this morning, remember?
No,uh,what i remember was you
asking me to the movies tonight,
And me saying i couldn't because i
was going to watch carlos' band play.
You got invitation out of that?
Well,i'm here now,dear,
and i have this lovely limo.
So come on. We'll ride
over to the club in style.
Well,here's the thing. I'm
supposed to go with my girlfriends.
Oh,Gaby,please,i was so
looking forwardo this.
Don't make me go all alone.
Well,i guess we're all
going to the same place.
I'll just see my friends there.
Oh,goody!
Dr. Smith to cardiac i.c.u.
Where's anne?
She's asleep. She's fine.
What happened?
I went over to talk to anne
about recent developments.
You went to her house?
Yes,i did,porter. I had to talk to anne.
I didn't know that her husband was
there, and he overheard us and...
The doctors say she's gonna be fine.
Porter,wh- where are
you going? Damn it!
"tonic water,bourbon,ketchup."
This is your grocery list?
There's got to be something else on
Dave's phone bill that will lp us.
Uh,there isn't.
Oh,don't get broccoli.
It isnotyour friend.
You're telling me that you cross-checked all
those other numbers, and there was nothing?
Squat.
The key is this doctor guy.
Yeah.
Maybe we should just bite
the bullet and go to boston.
Yeah. Maybe we can get more
out of him face-to-face.
Hey,you wanna go to a rock show tonight?
Me? With you?
Well,i'm a little out of your league,
but if it'll get you there, sure.
I don't think i can, but thanks.
Here,in case you change your mind.
and then I noticed that maria's
pockets were stuffed with silverware.
I'm telling you,it's impossible
to find good help these days.
Well,you'll know soon enough when my
cholesterol finally
gets the better of me.
Don't talk like that.
You want a cheeseburger or something?
That has got to stop.
I'm gonna do something.
Why?
Julie's a grown woman.
Uh-huh,she's a grown woman with stars in
her eyes who's in love with a 3-time loser.
If she wants to accept his
proposal,that's her business.
But in the meantime,you're
not gonna ruin his surprise.
En't I?
No.
Aren't I?
No.
you're right.
I'll stay out of it.
Oh,now where is the little girls' room?
Hey,why did that guy hand you a cd?
Your name isn't julie,is it?
No. Why?
Well,there's a song on
there he wants me to play.
I guess he's gonna propose to
his girlfriend or something.
Tonight?!
isn't that lovely?
whoa,oh julie,julie,julie,do
you love me?
Julie,julie,julie,do you care?
Julie,julie,are you thinking of me?
Hey,you two.
What's going on?
Um,nothing.
What's going on with you?
Oh,I just love this song.
and jackson doesn't like to dance,so...
isn't this fun?
It was.
Oh,reminds me of being young and single.
Oh,I wish I'd never given up that.
yeah,susan.
Listen,uh,I don't want
to,uh,uh,sound rude or anything,
but this is really a-a
moment that's meant for two.
Right! Right.
You mind easing away so i
can dance with my dauter?
mm,susan?
What are you doing?
I'M... just movin' to the music.
Mm,yeah.
You're coming with me.
Uh,no. No. No,no. No!
Oh,all right!
But no matter what he asks
you,promise me you'll say "no."
Susan!
lloyd,I'm sorry.
I can't help i I don't want my
daughter to be someone's fourth wife.
Wife?
Were you gonna ask me to marry you?
Oh,uh,were we not clear on that by now?
You can't be serious.
We've only been dating three months.
Well,yes,I know,but I have
such a good feeling about us.
Right,better feelings than you
had about wives one,two and three?
Mom.
You are very sweet,but
I'm not getting married...
ever.
"Ever"?
W-what do you mean "ever"?
We'll talk about this later.
I just really need a moment to myself.
Thank you.
Bree,darling.
Spare me your "darling," sandra.
I know you've been trying
to dig up dirt on me.
Mm,just doing my job.
And frankly,I didn't
have to dig all that hard.
I wrote a cookbook,sandra--
meatloaf,pot pies,peach cobbler.
Why are you trying to crucify me?
Because it's not a cookbook,bree.
It's a "look how great I am" book
one designed to make every woman who reads it
feel like a failure if she doesn't measure up.
What you're selling's a total sham.
But it isn't,sandra,because
I don't think I'm great.
I have fallen down more
times than I can count,
just like so many other
housewives out there.
We're all just barely holding
on,and we all think that we're alone.
So maybe you're right.
Maybe it isn't a cookbook.
It's a lifeline from
me to those other women,
because I want them to know there's
always a chance to get something right...
even if it's just a casserole.
Why didn't you just tell
me that right up front,bree?
That's an angle I can work with.
I got some good news today.
I've been speaking with the headmaster
at greenbrier country day school,
and I got them to reserve
two spots for the girls.
They start next term.
Well,thanks,but the girls
already have a school.
Yes,I know--a
public school.
This is a good school.
Virginia,they're happy where they are.
They love fairview.
Besides,greenbrier's,like,an hour away.
So i'll get them a drir.
That would be a real treat for them.
No,I want them to be close by.
They could need me during the
school day- get sick or something.
Oh,that's what school nurses are for.
Dear,this is a decision I
feel very strongly about.
I'm afraid I have to insist.
Excuse me.
You don't get to insist on anything
when it comes to my daughters.
I think,given the extent of my investment
in this family,I should have some say.
I'll just give you some
time to think about it.
I don't need any time to think about it.
Keep your money.
Now you're being reckless.
You know something?
I like money.
I like it a lot.
And a couple years ago,you could've
bought me with that big fortune of yours.
But I'm a mom now,and i make
the decisions for my kids.
And that is something
that cannot be bought.
Gaby,I can make a decision,too.
I can call my lawyer tomorrow
morning and take you out of my will.
And that is your right
as a crazy old rich lady.
thank you.
Screening your calls now,dave?
Let me guess.
You can explain everything.
I'm really,really sorry,doc.
You changed your name
and didn't tell me.
You're living in fairview- the
one place you swore you wouldn't go.
I didn't change my name to be deceptive.
I just wanted a fresh start.
Fairview is not a fresh start for you.
My wife edie- she's from here,and she
really wanted to move back,and I said okay.
Did you tell her your history?
Did you tell her why it's
not healthy- or safe.
For you to be here?
She knows everything,and I'm in
a really good place right now.
But...can we talk about
this after the show?
These guys...they're my
friends,and they're depending on me.
The moment you're finished playing.
let's start this year's battle
of the bands with our first group.
Give it up for cold splash!
spare me the apology for butting
into my life for the millionth time.
What is this about you
never getting married?
Why would I?
If there's one thing I've learned from
your experience,marriage is a joke.
Hey,I believe in marriage.
Why?
First there was dad,who left you
for his secretary,and then mike...
he was the love of your
life,and it still went to hell.
I mean,honestly...
just tell me what the upside is.
Oh,julie,you're way too
young to be this cynical.
I am not cynical.
I'm realistic.
I'M...I'm just trying to protect myself.
Well,putting a wall around
your heart doesn't protect you.
It just keeps people out.
I learned that the hard way.
Now with jackson...
I remember that I like feeling hopeful.
I like believing in
"happily ever after."
I really wish that
you felt that way,too.
sorry about the tip,but
I just lost $50 million.
Gaby,have you seen porter?
No,I haven'T.
Why? Is he supposed to be here?
No. So if you see him,please tell me.
Thanks.
yeah,come on. Tonight,we're not a plumr
and a masseur and a guy that makes pizzas.
We're a rock 'n' roll band.
Right,dave?
Absolutely.
Look,I'm gonna check with
the guy about the light cues.
Hey,doc.
He's in your band?!
I know.
It sounds crazy,but we've
worked through everything.
It's cool.
No. This is too dangerous.
I need to speak to him right now.
C,you just have trust
me on this one,okay?
Now,dave.
I speak to him right now...
or I call the police.
okay.You win.
Come on.
I hope you realize I'm only doing
this because I want to help you.
I genuinely care about you,dave.
I know you do,dr. Heller.
And I like you.
actually,I like you a lot.
I'm sorry.
a bit about yourself?
I know this is gonna sound crazy,but
I can actually smell our fear.
If I could see wherethe
exits are,I'd run for 'em.
I can't believe we let
dave talk us into this.
By the way,where is dave?
hey,jackson.Where are you going?
The guys are about to start.
Uh,bathroom.
Back in a sec.Oh, the men's room's packed,
but there's an employee bathroom back there.
Thank you.
hey,dave,is that the bathroom?
No. I think that's it there.
Okay.Thanks.
We're up.
Where the hell is dave?
Sorry.
we thought you ditched
us.Where were you?
Needed a little liquid courage.
Come on,boys.Let's do it.
odyssey!Odyssey!
Okay,ladies and gentlemen,the
battle of the bands is back,
solease give a big
welcome to blue odyssey.
Warren
ʲô

I know what you did to anne.
Better listen to your mommy,little boy.
Go home.
You're dead.I don't care
what it takes.You're dead.
Stop it!Go on!Go on!Go on!
You've been running all over
town hitting women and children?
You must be so proud.
Lock that door.
What were you thinking?
You could've gotten hurt in there!
You are responsible for this.
Whatever happens is your fault.
ride,sally,ride  one
of these early mornings

Fire!
what's--what's

Oh,there's an exit there.He'll get out.
Come on.We have to go now.
hey!Open up!
gaby!
Your friend!
Hey!
oh,crap.
Come on.
Let's get you out of here.
Let's go.
Hey,since I'm saving your life and all,
you wannthink about maybe
keeping us in your will?
No.
Eh,it was worth a shot.
it's locked.
Look out!
Come on.
No,I gotta make sure everyone gets out of here.
Go! Go!
don't push!
One at a time!
Jackson!
Jackson!
What are you doing?Get
the hell out of here!
Jackson--he's
still in there.
He's in the bathroom.
I'll get him.Go.Just go.
Mike--

Go!
jackson!
jackson!
jackson.Thank god.
Where's mike?
I don't know.I didn't see him.
is he still in there?
Yeah!He went in there to find you.
What?Mike? Mike's still in there?
Dave,no!
Mike!
Mike!
Mom!Dad.
Porter,I told you to go home.
What are you doing here?
You!
You son of a bitch!
You did this!
What are you talking about?
Stay away from my kid!
Your kid burned down my club.
Susan,do you think he's still in there?
I didn't see him.
Look,my husband's still inside.
You've gotta go back in there!
I'm sorry.That roof
is about to collapse.
Now please get back.
Someone's coming!
hang in there.
I'm not done with you yet.
There was a fire last night in fairview.
Ifou open up your morning paper,you
can read about those who survived...
and those who were injured...
those who barely escaped
with their lives...
and those who didn'T.
You can also read about a man who
risked his life to rescue his neighbor.
What you won't read about are
the reasons for this bravery.
You're the one who pulled
that guy out of the fire.
Can I interview you?
and that's because...
no one ever doubts...a hero.
Previously on Desperate Housewives...
Porter's affair...
Your son loves me, and i love him.
Escalated into violence.
Hey,warren.
Yeah?
I don't care what it takes. You're dead.
But the full extent of
Dave's rage was realized...
Fire!
During the battle of the bands.
Mike!
And out of the tragedy came a hero.
Hang in there.
I'm not done with you yet.
Something awful happened
to gabrielle solis...
And she was reminded of this every
time she looked in a mirror...
Every time she glanced
at an old photo...
And every time she walked past a man.
Yes,gabrielle knew
she had lost her looks.
But she tried her best to
look on the bright side.
After all,what woman
needs to be beautiful...
When her husband is blind?
Hi,sweetie.
How's our patient?
Well,he took a pretty nasty
fall in the fire last night.
But,uh,the c.t.scan shows
no bleeding or swelling.
That's it? No concussion?
Actually,there is something.
Please tell me it's not my hearing.
I'm already down to four senses.
The scan revealed a tiny bone fragment that
may be putting pressure on the optic nerves.
And,what,you're afraid it's
gonna impair his vision?
I'm sorry. You were saying?
The bone fragment might be a remnant
from your injury five years ago.
Due to its small size, the
original scan might have missed it.
Mm,five years. Can't we just leave it?
Actually,there is a chance if we remove that
bone fragment, you could regain your sight.
Are you serious?
That's fantastic!
I'm not promising a slam dunk here.
I'm just saying it's possible.
Doc,two days ago,i spread
moisturizer on a cracker.
I'd kill for "possible."
I've spoken with ted daniels.
He's the best eye surgeon in the state.
He says he could fit you in
for surgery in about a month.
Oh,my god.
If this works, i'll finally be able to
see my little girls and my gorgeous wife.
This is unbelievable! Thank you.
Doctor, thank you very much.
Yes,gabrielle solis knew
she had lost her beauty.
She also knew the time
had come to get it back.

Housewives Season05 Episode09</font>
{\a6}TRAGEDY IN NIGHTCLUB
There was a fire in
the town of fairview,
And those who had been injured came to
recover at fairview memorial hospital.
{\a6}INTENSIVE CARE UNIT
By morning, their burns
had been bandaged...
Their broken bones had been set.
And their wounds had begun healing.
Yes,everyone was well on
their way to recovery...
Except for the man who
had started the fire.
You see,hissuffering was just beginning.
Sorry.
That's all right.
Are you Dave williams?
Yeah.
I'm detective collins. This is
detective lyons. You have a moment?
Why?
We wanted to talk to you about
the fire at the white horse bar.
We've been interviewing everyone
who was there last night.
We were told by an...
Orson hodge that you were onstage
with the band when theire broke out.
Yeah. We had just started when...
Suddenly the curtains went up.
Everything happened
really fast after that.
That's okay. We know how
hard this has got to be.
So... Have they figured
out how the fire started?
We know it was arson.
Really?
It's looking like the point of origin
was the storage room off the back hallway.
And there was a body in there,too.
And you think that's the
person who started the fire?
No,we don't think so.
But this guy was pretty badly burned,
so it'll take us a while to identify him.
Anyway,if you,uh, remember
anything you think we should know,
Give a call at that
number there. All right?
Dave williams...
Aren't you the one who went back
in and saved that delfino guy?
Yeah.
You're an honest to god hero.
You should be real proud of yourself.
If you say so.
I would've come sooner,
but i burnt the first batch,
And i wasn't sure you'd
appreciate the irony.
I'm so hungry, i wouldn't have noticed.
Hey,can i get a kiss from my cookie?
Mike!
What if someone sees us?
What if they do?
You haven't told Susan we're dating yet.
I'm waiting for the right time.
Her friendship's very important to
me, and i want to ease her into this.
Okay. I get it.
See ya.
Just walk out slowly.
Give me something to live for.
Susan.
How's jackson?
Uh,he's fine, just getting
some stitches. How's...
Wait,who are you here to see?
You know... Everybody.
So many people in the
neighborhood were hurt in the fire.
I just thought it would be
nice to bring them... Gifts.
Crap! I didn't get anyone gifts.
But ididgive blood, so i'll just
remind everybody that i did that.
How you feeling? I just gave blood.
Uh,i'm fine,just a
little smoke inhalation.
How's jackson doing?
Oh,fine. He just needs some stitches.
Ooh,those cookies look
delicious. Where'd you get 'em?
A friend. Have one.
Oh,i shouldn't. They're yours.
You know you want to.
Well,i did just give blood.
Attractive.
Mm,i hate macadamia nuts.
You think they're white chocolate chips
until it's too late. Stupid hawaii.
Who made 'em?
Like i said, a friend.
Yeah. But what friend?
Wait. Is this a woman friend?
Um,don't you wanna throw
that macadamia nut away?
When i'm done. Don't change the
subject. Are you seeing someone?
Why doyoucare?
I care because you mean a lot to me,
And it makes me feel good knowing that
two people have found love and happiness.
So what's her name? Who am i happy for?
Susan,i'm not tellingou.
Why not?
Because she wants to tell you herself.
So... I know her?
Whoa,i think my meds just kicked in.
I don't know what i'm saying.
You're dating a friend of mine?
Don't be angry.
i'm not,but now you have
to tell me who she is.
Fine.
Have it your way.
Oh,if he ever needs a transfusion, you
are not allowed to give him my blood.
Hello,dr. Cominis.
How's my husband doing?
Well,the x-rays indicate
there was no concussion,
So i think we're gonna
release him today.
Wonderful. The house was
too quiet without him.
You'll have to wait to talk to him.
He's been in a lot of pain, so we
gave him something to help him sleep.
Oh,that's all right. I can wait.
Mmm,he looks so peaceful.
Goodness. I'm sure if orson were
awake, he'd apologize for that.
Has he always snored?
Occasionally, but
never quite this--
robustly.
Well,the injury to his
septum might've made it worse.
But it can be corrected with
a simple surgical procedure.
Well,if it's so simple,
what are we waiting for?
It'll take a few weeks to schedule.
So... Soon as he wakes
up, you can take him home.
Well... At least the house
won't be quiet anymore.
I ran into katherine.
She said you wanted to
see me about something.
Right. What was it?
Oh,yeah. Thanks for saving my life.
Yeah,well... We all did
what we had to do,right?
And you went back in for jackson.
Yeah,but i ended up
passed out on the floor,
Which,technically,makes
me an idiot and you a hero.
Yeah,people keep saying that.
I don't... Feel like one.
Well,i would've been dead without you.
So... How about free plumbing
for the rest of your life?
That sounds fair.
Seriously,you've,uh, you gotta
let me do something to thank you.
Well,ever since my brother
died,i haven't had a...
Really good friend.
Think you could handle that job?
I think i could.
The stitches are in. I'll need
to see you again in a few days.
Would you like some pills for the pain?
Nah,stitches never
bother me. I'll be fine.
Great. Then let me get another
bandage,and we'll be done.
Thank you.
Mr. And mrs. Scavo?
Can we ask you a few follow-up
questions about the fire?
We already told you
everything we can remember.
This will only take a moment.
It's come to our attention
that the owner of the club
And your son got into a fight
minutes before the fire broke out.
Now did you witness that?
I saw a grown man beating
up on my teenage boy.
What else do you want to know?
During the altercation, did your
son threaten to kill mr. Schilling?
No.
Really?
Well... I was right there,detective.
My son said no such thing.
You sure?
Absolutely.
Thank you for your time.
Maybe i'm being a little paranoid here,
But i sort of got the feeling
that you were lying to the police.
Lynette,please, tell me that porter
did not threaten to kill mr. Schilling.
Got the bandage.
You might wanna go ahead and
give him those pain pills,doc.
He's gonna need 'em.
I don't understand.
Carlos might get his sight
back. You should be thrilled.
Oh,i know. It's just...
He's been through so much these past
five years, and he's never complained.
I just think he deserves to open his eyes to a
wife who doesn't tuck her boobs into her pants.
Oh,Gaby,please. Most women
would kill to look like you.
But i'm not most women.
I was an international fashion model,
and that's how carlos remembers me.
You are still beautiful.
So you've gained a
little weight. Who hasn't?
Don't go by me. I have
a weird metabolism.
Hey there!
I just heard the good news about carlos!
What's wrong?
Gaby thinks that carlos isn't gonna find
her attractive after he gets his sight back.
Yeah,that was my first thought,too.
Edie!
Oh,it's okay,it's okay. Let her talk.
At least she's being honest.
It's the kind of support and
friendship i need right now.
Fine. You're a pig.
Thank you.
God,what am i gonna do?
Well... You're gonna stop whining,for
one. You got a month,right?
That's pley of time to go on
a diet and start exercising.
By the time carlos gets his eyesight
back, you are gonna be looking hot...
Or hot-ish.
Really? I mean,do you
think i could pull this off?
Of course, even though i still think
you're beautiful just the way you are.
You gonna start that crap again?
I don't believe it.
Tom,i was 6 feet away.
Porter looked warren
schilling in the eye and said,
"you're dead.I don't care
what it takes. You're dead."
That doesn't prove a thing.
And--and--and i'm
sure he didn't mean it.
Maybe he didn't.
But ten minutes later,
that nightclub was on fire.
No. No!
I know porter. He wouldn't commit
arson just to get back at someone.
What about rick's restaurant?
Porter and his brother burned that down.
That was five years ago.
I mean,they--they were
trying to protectus.
They--they--nobody
got hurt.
The building was empty.
Yes,thattime, the building was empty.
This isinsane.
Lynette,are you actually telling
me that our son is a murderer?
I'm lling you i heard him
threaten warren schilling.
I don't know what happened next.
What if somebody saw him?
What if he left behind evidence?
What are we gonna do?
We're going to protect our son.
Even if he killed six people?
We're going to protect our son.
Okay.
Oh,boy!
Who knew healthy food
could look so tasty?
Okay,dig in.
What's wrong?
It smells like the beach that
time they wouldn't let us swim.
It's a recipe i got
from a diet magazine.
It's--it's fish
and broccoli.
Fish?
Yes. Not all fish is
shaped like a stick.
Now i know you're not used
to it,but give it a try.
You're gonna love it.
Yummy.
It's still in your mouth.
See? Delicious!
I want macaroni.
Hey,i'm not a short-order cook.
I don't have time to make
different meals for everyone.
It comes in a box. It's not that hard.
Okay,look.Mommy needs
to lose a few pounds,
and it's not easy eating healthy
with you two in front of me,
Scarfing down all the good stuff.
So what do you say? You want to
help mommy be beautiful again?
No.
You got a lot of nerve.
Part of the reason i'm on this diet is because
carrying you 2 brats for 18 months made mommy fat!
And you with the
head- you ruined me!
So this is how it's gonna go down.
You're gonna eat fish with mommy
and you're gonna like it. Got it?
Thank you.
A spokesman from fairview memorial hospital
says this latest death raises the total to seven.
Oh,come on. You're watching that again?  Authorities
estimate there may have been as many as 100--
Sorry.
Are you okay?
I just...
This fire--i still can't
believe it really happened.
I mean,they just said another
person died this afternoon.
That makes... Seven.
Well,if it makes you feel any better,
they think they know who did it.
Who?
Well,it's just a rumor, but i hear
they're looking at porter scavo.
Porter? Why would they think it's him?
I don't know. I guess there was a fight
between him and the guy who owns the club.
You know,i've known that kid since he was 6
years old, and i always thought he was trouble.
And trust me,i'm areallygood
judge of character.
You slept on the couch?
Why? It's so uncomfortable.
Yes,it is. Sit down. We need to talk.
What's wrong?
Orson,dear, because of the way your nose
was broken during the fire, you now snore.
Oh,didn't i snore before?
Good point. Snoring is too mild
a word for what you're doing.
Imagine a terrified
elephant summoning his herd.
You know,Bree, i can't help but
take issue with your sarcastic tone.
Snoring is not something
that i can help.
Not exactly true.
The doctor said there's
a very simple procedure--
Procedure?
Very routine and- and
practically outpatient.
You mean surgery? No way.
I had an uncle who died during
an "outpatient procedure."
He went in for a broken wrist. They
put him under. He never woke up.
You don't have an uncle!
Fine. He was more of a family friend.
No,the point is, he's still dead, and
i am not having unnecessary surgery.
This is absolutely necessary.
I am going through a
very stressful time.
I have interviews,that cooking
demonstration at the mall.
If i don't get my rest,it could
affect the launch of my book.
Well, that's very reasonable.
Youget to be a best-selling author.
Iget to b an organ donor.
Orson,if we can't share a bed, it's going
to hurt the intimacy of our marriage.
My death will have the same effect.
Oh,orson, i can't help but take
issue with yoursarcastictone.
I hear you're getting discharged today.
Are you going back home?
Home? Hmm,let's see...
Two cracked ribs, black eye...
Nope,got everything i need from there.
I'm sure you heard about
the nightclub burning down.
Yeah,i heard.
Your husband's blaming porter.
What?
Porter would never do anything li that.
What's this?
I'm helping you help me.
This way,you get to start a new life,
And i get to not have you around
while my son is going through all this.
What if i'm not ready to leave?
Well,then you can face statutory
rape charges without the money.
Your call.
I'll pick you up tonight.
I'll give you a ride to the bus station.
You can count it then.
Hey,do you wanna take a walk?
I need a little girlfriend time.
I've got something in the oven,
but you can come in if you want.
So... What's on your mind?
Well... It's about Mike.
Mike?
Yeah.
Can you imagine how upset i was when i
discovered he's dating a friend of mine?
Oh,Susan,i'm
so--
it's gotta be lisa wallace.
So shocked at lisa! How dare she?
You know,she has wanted to get
her hooks into Mike for years.
Every time she would have us over for a
barbecue, she always wore something booby.
Well,in lisa's defense, maybe
she thinks you're over Mike,
Which is something i've
heard you say more than once.
Well,it doesn't matter.
She's my friend.
She should've co to me
and discussed it first.
Well,you're not always available.
And besides...Maybe...
lisa was waiting to see
if this thing had a future.
All things we can discuss when i
knock her teeth out with a pool cue.
You know,it's sad when
you can't trust a friend.
Or maybe the lesson here is that she
wasn't really a friend to begin with then.
What's wrong?
Susan,i swear i was gonna tell y.
It's fine. It's... Fine.
I just didn't think it
would be such a big deal.
I mean, you're seeing jackson now.
Yes,i am. You're perfectly right.
And i've been so lonely lately.
Well,now you're not.
I know you're mad at me. Would you
just please yell at me or something?
Oh,damn it. I should've
listened to Bree.
Bree?
Yes. She told me weeks ago i should've told you.
So Bree knew?
Yes.
Okay. Well,have a nice day.
So... We're okay then?
You knew about katherine and Mike?
Oh,god,Susan. Can't this
wait till after my nap?
Why didn't you tell me?
I didn't think it was my place.
I thought katherine should tell you.
Well,she didn't.
I'm sorry.
Uh,not good enough.
Y-you had a million chances to
say something and you didn't.
That is just the same
as lying to my face.
You know,i always thought that the one
thing i could depend on you for was honesty.
What happened to that?
You want honesty? Fine.
You didn't want to divorce Mike.
You hit a really bad patch after the
accident, but you never stopped loving him.
And why would you?
Your relationship didn't
have a natural end.
So face it. You're not mad
at me or Mike or katherine.
You're mad at yourself for
letting your marriage fall apart.
What am i supposed to do?
Either tell Mike how
you feel or move on,
Because that's what he's trying to
do, and it's not fair to stop him.
You need to make a decision, Susan.
And i need to get back to my nap.
I know ****not to get our hopes up...
But i can't help it. My hopes
are up. I am gonna see again!
I knew it. Ou're excited,too.
I can hear it in your voice.
Hi,dr. Bach! How are you?
Hi,mrs. Solis.
Hey,doc! We are still
reeling over the good news.
Well,i have even better news.
Dr. Daniels just had a cancellation.
He can fit you in next friday.
Friday?
But you said it would
be at least a month.
I mean,that's so soon.
So? Friday's great.
Okay,i didn't wanna have to say this, but
you should never have surgery on a friday.
The surgeons are thinking about
the weekend. They're all distracted.
Next thing you know,you come out of the
o.r.still blind and missing your right leg.
Why are you talking like this?
Also,the surgery is very expensive.
We need time to figure out
how we're gonna pay for it.
How about using our insurance?
That only covers 85%.
And we arebroke.
You know what? The hospital has a foundation
to help people in this exact situation.
No. We don't accept charity.
What? Wealwaysaccept charity!
Well,i have turned over a new leaf.
I'm sorry about the timing,
carlos,but it is what it is.
Gaby,we are doing this
friday. Now drop it.
So you say this guy's good, huh,doc?
Dr. Daniels is one of the
top guys in the country.
That's what i like to hear.
Bree...
Pleaselet me sleep in my bed.
No.
I promise not to snore.
And--and if i do, i will go down to
the sofa and stay as long as you say.
And how exactly are
you gonna stop snoring?
Well,i read somewhere that
chamomile tea helps prevent it.
That doesn sound right.
Well,it's worth a try, right?
Look,i'll- i'll
brew you a cup,too.
Whatever.
There you go. Drink that up.
All right,but i think i'll
be too tired to finish it.
That pill i took really kicked in fast.
You took a pill? When did you do that?
When you were downstairs.
Uh,oh,well, then you shouldn't drink
this, because the chamomile actually,uh,
Counteracts the effect
of the sleeping pill.
Since when have you become
such an expert on chamomile?
Well,the point is, we shouldn't risk it.
Fine. I just know i
need my sleep tonight.
That's it.
We'll finish that thought Tomorrow.
I,um,don't suppose you'd tell
porter something for me,would you?
I know this is probably the last
thing you want to hear, but...
Idolove your son.
He was very sweet to me.
Kindness has always...
Been a weakness of mine.
Good luck.
Anne?
When the baby comes,
you don't contact porter.
You can contact Tom or me, and we'll
do what we can for you from a distance.
Understood?
There's no baby. Never was.
Hello?
I just got a call from the
lady at the department store.
She said that mom's late.
Late for what?
For the cooking demonstration.
That's today?
Yeah. It was supposed
to start ten minutes ago.
Look,i'm in mt.Pleasant right
now buying some end tables
so you're gonna have to get her there.
Orson?
Bree,honey? Wake up. It's 9:15.
9:15? 9:15. I'm supposed
to be at the mall.
Did i forget to set the alarm?
We need to get dressed.
I'll get you some clothes.
I'm so thirsty.
Well,i'll bring you some juice.
That's all right. I'll
just drink this tea.
Bree.
What?
On second thought, you need coffee.
Almost there.
All right,coffee time.
Enough coffee. It's not
working,anyway. It must be decaf.
No,it's a triple espresso.
I just don't understand
why i feel so loopy.
Very mysterious.
Look,Bree,all you gotta do
is whip up a few pancakes,
Hand out some advance copies of
your book, and we're outta here.
Do you think you can handle that?
Of course i can.
You are such a nervous nellie,rex.
Oh,and here's the lady who's gonna teach us
how to make her traditional buckwheat pancakes--
Bree van de kamp.
Thank you for joining us.
Thank you for having
me to your lovely home.
Bree,um,your book is about so much
more than just recipes,isn't it?
Yes,my book is about food and families
and how food brings families together
when they make food.
It's mothers teaching
daughters how to cook.
So i'm gonna cook
pancakes with my daughter,
Only she's not here 'cause
she grew up and stole my baby.
So... Who wants to be my daughter?
Hello?
It's me. I just wanted to tell you...
I've been thinking about it, and,um,
i'm okay with you dating Mike.
You are? You don't hate me?
No... And i think it's great.
Oh,Susan,thank you. I was so worried.
I just... I didn't know what
i'd do if i lost you as a friend.
Well,you haven't.
Just... Treat him well,
okay? He's a really good guy.
I will.
Hey,um,i was just about
to make a cappuccino.
You wanna come over?
No,thanks. I'm really busy.
I have a lot of things to do today.
Another time though,okay?
Bye.
Just call me back,okay?
I really need to talk to you.
Who's that?
Nobody. Just a kid at school.
I lent him my bus pass.
Listen,we need to talk.
What's up?
I have to ask you something, and it is
very important that you tell me the truth.
Okay.
Did you set that fire at the nightclub?
Before you answer, let
me say that if you did,
I promise,your father and i will stand behind you
and try and find some way out of this nightmare.
But if you lie to me, d i
find out later that you...
Killed... Those people...
Well,i will love you.That
will never change,
but i won't believe in
you anymore, and if i...
Don't believe in
you... I can't help you.
We have to tell each other
the truth from here on out.
Mom... I don't know who set
the fire, but it wasn't me.
Of course it wasn't. Of course.
Then we're gonna be okay, as
long as you keep telling thtruth.
Everything's gonna be fine.
Mom?
There is one thing i lied about.
What?
When you walked in, i was
leaving a message for anne.
She hasn't returned my calls, and
the hospital said she checked out.
Do you have any idea where she is?
No. Sweetie,i don't.
You know what i'm really excited about?
Christmas lights.
I might be able to see christmas
lights again and holiday derations.
Man,i really miss that stuff.
Yeah,well,let's keep
Our fingers crossed.
You okay?
Yeah. It's my hamstring.
I've just been working out.
You want me to rub it?
No,no,you rest.
You're gonna have
surgery in a couple days.
I know. I can't wait.
You know,carlos, i know you're really excited
to see christmas decorations again, but...
I just want you to
be prepared because...
Well,so of those lights
may have lost their luster.
So should we buy new decorations?
No,i'm talking aboutme.
Imay have lost my luster.
Come on. I'm always gonna find
you beautiful. I told you that.
Yeah,that's when you thought
you were gonna be blind forever.
But if this operation works, i just
don't want you to be disappointed.
Oh,come here.
Did i ever tell you when i
knew i was gonna marry you?
First time you saw me on the runway.
No,that's when i knew i
was gonna sleep with you.
No,i knew i was gonna marry you the night
we went to that restaurant on third street.
Mmm,i remember that place.
You wore a white linen sundress.
And you ordered this
giant plate of ribs.
And you ate them with such gusto,
up to your elbows in barbecue sauce,
Meat hanging from your teeth
and grease in your hair.
And when it was all over, i
pointed out what a mess you were.
Well,you pulled out your
mirror, took a look at yourself
and just let out this huge,Happy,
totally unrestrained laugh.
The room completely filled with it...
And i thought to myself, nowthatis a
sound i'd like to hear the rest of my life.
That's why i proposed to you, and
it had nothing to do with your looks.
You know when i decided i
wanted to be with you forever?
No. When?
About two seconds ago.
Up until then, it was
pretty touch-and-go.
*********
well,my husband has agreed to
the procedure you suggested.
Oh,the one to alleviate his snoring?
Yes,that's the one.
So anytime you wanna get in there and
start hacking away, he's ready for you.
Aren't you,love?
Yes,dear.
Well,how is two weeks from friday?
Well,fridays are when orson plays golf.
So friday's perfect. Right,orson?
Right... Dear.
I'm sorry,mr. Hodge. I'm sensing you're
a bit apprehensive about the surgery.
Oh,he's not apprehensive.
He's terrified.
And i don't care, because
he owes me one- A big one.
Don't you,darling?
I sure do.
I'm sorry. What's going on here?
Are you married, dr. Cominis?
No,but i just moved in with someone.
Well,over time,you'll learn that there's
a balance of power in relationships,
And if your beloved ever pulls
a nasty trick on you, like say,
Drugging you into a stupor, then
the balance of power shifts to you,
And then you can demand they prove
their love by,say,undergoing surgery.
Do you understand?
Not really.
You will.
Come along,orson.
Hey,hon,listen, can you
promise me something?
Tell me we'll never grow into one of those insane
couples that just lives to make each other crazy.
Well,no worries there.
You already make me crazy.
Oh,hey,guess what? I,uh,i picked
up our new end tables today.
Yeah,hurry home. I want you to see 'em.
If you walk through
fairview memorial hospital,
You will encounter all sorts of
people doing their best to recover.
It might be a husband licking his
wounds after a marital battle...
Or two parents rallying
from an attack of doubt.
It might be a wife who's been
cured of low self-esteem...
Or a pair of lovers who find
honesty to be the best medicine.
Sadly,you will alsoind some poor
souls afflicted with a condition
they will never recover from.
Detectives,i heard you were
still here, interviewing people,
and i have...Something to tell you.
Okay.
The night of the fire...
I was back by the storage room.
Yes?
And i saw somebody come out--
a kid who lives on my block.
His name is porter scavo.
You asked me to tell you if
i remembered anything, and...
I remembered that.

Previously on Desperate Housewives...
A tragic event...
Led to the end of a marriage...
He's dating a friend of mine.
And the complications of moving on.
Medical wonders occurred...
If we remove that bone fragment,
you could regain your sight.
Both large and small.
My husband has agreed to
the procedure you suggested.
Oh,the one to alleviate his snoring?
Detectives...
And a devastating lie was told.
The night of the fire,
i saw somebody come out.
His name is porter scavo.
One morning, it
occurred to lynette scavo
she could not rememb the last time
her family had breakfast together.
So lynette did what any mother
would do in that situation...
See ya later,mom.
The first person who steps foot
out that door will lose a leg.
She threatened her family with violence.
That was delicious.
But i did promise chrissy
i'd walk her to school today.
Oh,you are such a gentleman.
Sit your ass down.
Dad,make mom let me go.
Everyone at this table who thinks i have
the power to make your mom do anything,
raise your hand.
Wish i could have helped.
Look,this family has
been through a lot lately,
And your dad and i feel we'll be better parents
if we know what's going on in your lives.
So,Parker,how's that science
project you've been working on?
Can i help you?
Is this the residence of porter scavo?
Yeah. Why?
I'm porter scavo.
Sir,can you step outside?
Can you step outside?
Porter scavo, you are under arrest.
What?
You have the right to remain silent.
Wait. What's going on?
Ma'am,i'm gonna have
to ask you to step back.
Okay,guys. Look,if this is
about warren schilling's bar,
Porter had nothing to do with that fire.
Apparently,there's a witness
that says otherwise.  A witness?I--
now will you please step
back and let us do our job?
If you give up that right, anything you
say can and will be used against you.
A witness? What are they talking about?
It's gonna be okay. We'll call a lawyer.
We'll get through this.
Lynette scavo couldn't remember the last
time her family had breakfast together...
I guess we're done talking
about my science project,huh?
Yes,sweetie,we are.
And she couldn't know
it would be many years
before her family would have
breakfast together again.

Desperate
Housewives Season05 Episode10</font>
It's an awful thing to live in the dark,
unable to see what
others take for granted.
But sometimes for a lucky few, a
flicker of light pierces that darkness
And brings with it the
promise of better days to come.
Do you see anything?
I see light...
And some fuzzy shapes.
That's it?
That's all he can expect to see right
now, but if he's able to see that much,
It won't be long till
his full sight returns.
Can you see me,babe?
Just your silhouette.
I can tell you cut your hair short.
It kinda makes your ears
stick out,but i like it.
Carlos,that's the
doctor. I'm right here.
It doesn't matter. I can see
something other than nothing.
Oh,this is a good day.
Now remember, his eyes will be very
sensitive for the next few weeks,
So low light indoors,
dark glasses outside--
Uh,doctor, we are very grateful, so
don't take this the wrong way,but...
Well,your septum looks great,
and you say your snoring's gone.
I think we're in good shape.
Will we need to come
in for a follow-up?
No. I think we're done.
You know,i always tell my patients i'm gonna
miss them, but this time, i really mean it.
Oh,we feel the same way
about you. You've been lovely.
Please excuse me.
What are you doing?  Leaving
the man a thank-you card.
For a doctor?
He helped you through
a very difficult time.
The least we can do is let him
know how much we appreciate...
What the hell is this?
You're living with the man? Since when?
Um,alex moved in six months ago.
Why the secrecy? Did
you think i'd disapprove?
The man's a doctor, for heaven
sakes. You've done better than i did.
That was a bit of a drive-by.
I'm just trying to understand how my son could
keep a secret like this from his own mother.
Mom,uh,come on.
I mean,since i came out, you haven't shown
the slightest interest in my love life.
Of course i have.
Handing me a pamphlet on
the resurgence of gonorrhea?
That's not what i'm talking about.
Think about it. Have you even
once asked if i was dating someone?
Well...
You see? You didn't really want to know.
That's why i didn't tell you.
Well,i want to know now, so that's why i'm
having you and alex over to dinner tomorrow night.
What?
Yes. If he's a part of your life,i want to get to know him.
I think i'll serve fish.
Actually,i said it wrong.
Um,i-i think it's kind of cool the
way that you ignore my love life.
Nice try. Tell alex we dress for dinner.
Mom,please don't.
Andrew,you can't criticize my parenting and
then deny me the chance to make up for it.
Orson and i will expect you at 8:00.
Okay.
Are you sure you want me there,too?
I mean,after all, i'm only a dentist.
Oh,for god sakes,orson. Let it go.
M.J.,hurry up. Your dad's here.
Hey,katherine. What are you doing here?
Well,i'm a big zoo fan, and when mike said he
was taking M.J., i asked if i could tag along.
So is that okay?
Of course. Why wouldn't it be okay?
I think it's...
Great.
Really,really great.
Sweetie,good news.
Katherine's gonna go
to the zoo with you.
Why doesshehave to go?
Well,she and your daddy are
friends, and the more,the merrier.
I just want daddy.
Oh,you got me,pal.
Hey,we're all gonna have a great time,
and we'll show katherine that
funny swing the monkey goes on.
Oh,that sounds so cool.
Will you show me that?
I guess.
Okay. Let's go.
Oh,don't forget his coat.
I'll find some way
to get him to like me.
I'm sure you will.
Boy,i'll bet the gift shop
at the zoo just loves divorce.
So... How you doing,son?
Not so good.
Okay,well,don't worry.
Bob here has agreed to represent you.
And when we're done here,
i'm going to go to the d.a.
And we're going to
start talking about bail.
But first,i gotta ask
you a few questions.
Like why do the police have a witness?
Lynette.
The d.a.says you were spotted coming out of
the storage room right before the fire started.
What gives?
I don't know what they're talking about.
I have an alibi.
You do?
G-great. Great.
Why haven't you told anyone this?
It's just... So embarrassing.
You are up for manslaughter, and
you're worried about being embarrassed?
If we can verify your story, i can
probably get the charges dropped.
We wouldn't even need
bail. So where were you?
I was at edie britt's.
Oh,please. Tell me you're
not having sex with her,too.
Dad.
What is wrong with girls your own age?
Do you know what i would
give to date a 17-year-old?
Okay,we're gonna talk about
that later. You were saying?
I'm not having sex with edie.
After i left the club, i went to her house,
but only so i could break in and steal her gun.
Why would you do that?
Mr. Schilling beat up anne
and then humiliated me.
I wanted to s-scare the hell out of him
just to wipe that smug look off his face.
But when i got back to
the club, it was on fire,
So i went home and hid
the gun in mom's flour jar.
Anywaythat's my alibi.
Think that'll help?
Did anyone see you do this?
No.
Then this is really not an alibi.
It's more a confession to another crime.
Well,you missed it.
Missed what?
Porter scavo got arrested today.
I knew he set that fire.
Poor lynette.
"poor lynette," my ass.
Poor seven people who
got burned to death. Boy.
I wouldn't wanna be in
lynette's shoes right now.
Can you imagine what
she's going through?
I mean,he is her son, so
she's kind of responsible.
God,the guilt she must be feeling.
Dave,what the hell?
You-you're bleeding.
Okay,come on. In the house. Let's
get this cleaned up. Come here.
You're just gonna sneak it back into
edie's house? What,are you crazy?
Tom,if you're gonna freak out,
can you do that in the other room?
I'm kind of busy here.
What has happened to us?
I mean,w-we're posting bail, returning
stolen guns- when did this become our life?
If edie reports this gun missing,
You don't have to be the sharpest cop on the
force to figure out where to start looking,
and that's the last
thing we need right now.
Thank god for you,lynette. You
always know what to do in a crisis.
Well,i try.
You're my rock. Lynette.
You know that,don't you?
Tom,your rock is trying to get
fingerprints off a weapon. You mind?
Thanks.
You're home kind of
early. Is everything okay?
Go up to your room. I'll come in in a
minute. We'll talk about what happened.
What did happen?
Well,M.J.threw his hot
fudge sundae at katherine.
Seriously?
That's terrible. Is she okay?
Well,she's got nuts and
whipped cream all in her hair,
And that little plastic coconut
bowl scratched her forehead.
Susan.
I'sorry.
The--the image in my mind is probably
way funnier than what actually happened.
Why did M.J.do that?
I don't know. Katherine and i were talking
about spending christmas in bermuda,
And she said she didn't want to go, 'cause she
thinks she doesn't look good in a bathing suit,
And i said she could be on the cover
of "sports illustrated," and bam!
M.J.throws his dessert.
That's the worst thing i've ever heard.
Well,he is only 5.
No,i'm talking about
that line you fed her.
"sports illustrated"?
What's the issue about,
the senior olympics?
I'm going to talk to M.J.
I mean,i could see her on the
cover of "menopause monthly."
Congratulations,Carlo
Everything is still a little blurry.
I can only make out,
like,shapes and shadows.
But in a week or so,everything
should be clear as a bell.
The whole thing's like a miracle.
And gaby h been so patient
through all of this.
She's really been an angel.
Damn it,carlos. What are you,a ron?
Ah,i hear a little
voice from heaven now.
Why aren't you wearing
your blackout glasses?
The doctor says your eyes
can't be exposed to any light.
I can only handle my husband
going blind once per marriage.
Whoops. Was that my baseball?
Yeah. I got it.
What do you think? Pretty cool,huh?
Uh,yeah. It's... Round.
Look at it. It was signed by lou gehrig.
Oh,looky there. Lou gehrig.
It was a gift passed down from my
grandfather to my father then to me.
It was? I didn't know that.
I thought it was some
stupid collectors item.
No. That's why i wouldn't let you
sell it when we were low on cash.
Uh,carlos,i think it's time
to put your eyedrops in.
Why don't you go do that?
Excuse me,ladies.
Oh,don't look at me that way.
I did what i had to do.
Gaby,you never sell a
man's autographed baseball.
The car needed tires.
How was i supposed to know he
was gonna get his sight back?
I mean, of all the rotten luck.
Who did you sell the ball to?
I don't know. Some italian guy.
Hey,mike's into baseball.
He must know someone who can track down this
lou gehrig guy and get him to sign a new one.
What?
It's okay.
What's going on? Is there news?
The judge just set bail.
Oh,thank god. How much?
20000.
That's high.
Where are we gonna
get that kind of money?
I guess we'll have to tap our emergency
fund. We've got 14 grand in there.
We've got another 800
more in the christmas club.
Look, we'll scrape it together.
Oh,god. G--i gotta
get to the restaurant.
Lynette,can you go to the
bank and take care of that?
Oh,sure.
Okay. Good.
Thank you.
Yeah.
Okay,well, i'll notify the judge
that you intend to post bail.
Wait. Slow down.
What?
You're my lawyer, so anything i
tell you is in confidence,right?
Well,technically, i'm
porter's lawyer,so don't--
just go with me on this.There
is no emergency fund.
I gave that mone to anne schilling so
she'd leave town, and tom has no idea.
Okay,just so i have this straight, you paid
off a potential witness to get her to flee?
Hey. Whose lawyer are you anyway?
Again,i'm porter's- -
what am i supposed to do?
Where am i gonna get that bail money?
You could go to a bail bondsman,
put up the house as collateral.
No. The house is mortgaged to the teeth.
Well, there is the restaurant.
I guess i have no other choice.
But again,this is all in
the strictest confidence.
Remember,you are my lawyer, not tom's.
Actually,lynette,i'm--
shut up!
So you see,it belonged to
my husband's grandfather,
And if i don't get it back, i am
telling you, i'm gonna be in the crapper.
What does that mean?
Means "no way." I'm sorry.
Oh,please. This is important.
Va bene. Va bene.
What? What's he saying?
He'd like to watch you dance...
What?
On the table.
Yeah,you know what? I'm gonna have
to call a big,fat... On that one.
Hi,lynette.
So sorry about porter.
If there's anything that we can do...
Well,actually,i wanted to borrow edie's
yellow sweater for the,uh,arraignment.
Yeah. Sorry. Edie's not here.
Well,is it okay if i go up and get it?
Yeah. Sure. Go ahead.
Thanks.
Please. You have to leave.
This isn't a good time, okay?
Fine. I'll--i'll
come see you tomorrow.
Just know that i still love
you, and that'll never change.
Never change.
Well,let me start by saying, it's so nice
to see you in a social setting, dr. Cominis.
Oh,please. I insist
you call me alex now.
All right then,alex.
Oh,look at you two, sitting
so far apart. Scootch over.
Uh,mom,w-we--we
don't need to scootch.
Well,i just want you to know,
if you need to scootch,alex,
I am okay with scootching and...
The rest of it.
Uh,look,mom,as much as we
appreciate your tolerance,
uh,we can wait until
we get home to make out.
Well,i just want you boys to know that
i am comfortable with your lifestyle.
Now who would like a
strawberry daiquiri?
Are--are you
expecting someone?
Well,orson and i thought it would be nice to
share this special occasion with some dear friends.
Bob and lee? What, are
you sponsoring a float?
Bree,you handle the introductions,
and i will check on dinner.
Bob hunter,lee mcdermott, i would like you to
meet andrew's new life partner, dr. Alex cominis.
A doctor.
He's a plastic surgeon.
You hear that,bob? I like
my eyes the way they are.
You're so touchy.
Have we met?
Not that i recall.
No,we have. I-i can't
think where,though.
I hear the gym is a
popular meeting place.
No,it's not that.
My mistake. I must--i must have
you confused with someone else.
Dinner's ready. Shall we?
Not so fast. Do you know that guy?
Yes.
Oh,my god. You're right. It is him.
Carlos,what's wrong?
Gaby,i can see them.
What?
I can make out colors and shapes.
Everything's starting
to come into focus.
Oh,my god. That's wonderful!
Look at all my girls.
Oh,you're right. She does look like mama.
Oh,i told you.
Daddy,ow you can watch me dance.
I know. I can't wait.
Oh,it's amazing.I can make
out almost everything--
the fireplace, our dining table.
Where's the painting
that we bought in greece?
I had to sell it a few months ago so
i could make the mortgage. I'm sorry.
I don't care about things. I can see
my family. That's what's important.
Really? That makes me
feel so much better.
You wouldn't believe all the stupid
things i've been worried about.
Like what?
Oh,it's silly. I sold
that baseball of yours.
But you're right. You can see,
and that's all that matters.
You sold my lou gehrig baseball?
Yeah,but it's just a thing.
We don't care about things.
Right,right.
But it was my father's and
his father's before him.
Yeah,and i know that now, but...
Juanita,dance for your dad.
Juanita,actually,why don't you take your sister
and,uh,go to the kitchen and get some cookies?
I'll be there in a minute.
This is a very special day for
all of us,so i'm not gonna get mad.
Uh,i'm just gonna say that i don't know what
was going through that featherhead of yours,
But i want that baseball back.
Got it?
Hey,this featherhead kept this
family afloat for five years.
You have no idea what i had to do
to keep this roof over our heads.
Look,there were two things that i asked
you not to sell- my baseball and my watch.
I didn't sell your watch.
Only because you couldn't get
it off my wrist,you little thief.
Gaby,you lied.
I want that baseball
back,and you're gonna get it.
And you might want to
lower the middle finger.
I can see now,remember?
Right. Damn.
Bree,that was hands-down the best
dinner i've ever had in my life.
You are so sweet.
You know,bree is the number
one caterer in fairview.
Oh,that's right.
Do you do weddings?
I wasn't gonna say anything.
Say anything about what?
Uh,nothing.
Nothing.
We're gonna have to tell them sometime.
Oh,my goodness,are you two...
Yes,yes. We're...
We're getting married.
And i hate you.
Oh,my god.
Congratulations.
Oh,my god.
See how excited they are?
Why would you wanna keep it a secret?
I am gonna handle
everything for this wedding.
That's why.
Now let me give my
new son-in-law a hug.
Butt out.
Well,if you'll excuse me,i am going to
go get a pie that you are going to love.
And you two are going to help me.
All right,you two,what is going on?
What are you talking about?
Don't give me that.
You've been whispering
to each other all night.
You obviously know alex.
How?
It's not important.
The man is going to marry my son.
If there is something about him i
should know,i want to hear it now,please.
We think we saw him in...
An adult movie.
By "adult," you mean
complex and sophisticated?
No,we mean gay porn.
What?
We saw this movie,"rear deployment."
All the actors played soldiers.
Bob likes uniforms,so...
Oh,thank you.
No,no,no. This can't possibly be true.
The man is a doctor.
Are you sure?
Well,we might be wrong.
No.
We rented it last month.
We paid the late charges.
Trust me. That's him.
*****guarantee if it's gonna
break after four months.
Or maybe you used your corkscrew as much in
four months as most people do in a lifetime.
Ever think of that?
Your mommy lashes out at
people prettier than she is.
You ever notice that?
Hey,katherine.
What a cute top.
So,uh,where you guys off to?
Bowling.
Come on,buddy. Let's get your jacket.
By the way,uh,i don't think
you're gonna have any problem.
I had a little talk with M.J.
Sure you did.
What is that supposed to mean?
It means things will be
a lot easier with M.J.
If you weren't talking trash
about me and mike dating.
What?
I don't do that.
Really?
M.J.always liked me before,and
then i start seeing mike,
And suddenly,i'm taking
incoming rocky road.
All right. Let's go
knock over some pins.
See you,ladies.
Bye.
What?
I have never said a negative
word about them dating ever.
I believe you.
It's just- you don't
have to say anything.
It's the way you act when she's around.
Kids pick up on that stuff.
What do you mean,the way i act?
"oh,katherine,what a cute top."
Kid translation- "have a nice time
at the bowling alley with my ex,whore."
Okay.
It-it's a little
uncomfortable,is whole situation.
I mean,if M.J.'s picking up on
it,how am i supposed to fix that?
Well,i didn't say
anything about fixing it.
Two of my friends involved
in a nasty catfight...
I live for that stuff.
Thanks for the corkscrew.
There you go,eetie.
Is that tight enough?
I guess.
What is going on?
Why were you on the phone so long?
Um,susan's coming.
What? Why?
Well,she wants M.J.to see us
all having a good time together.
That way,he might be more
accepting of you and me.
I suppose it's not a terrible idea.
Well,i think it's a good idea.
She feels like she's been sending the wrong
signals,and she wants to make up for it.
Well,it's nice of her to try,but just how
much of a show was she planning to put on for--
Hey,everybody!
Are we ready to have the best time ever?
Don't fall down,okay?
I'm not carrying you home.
I'm fine.
Stop worrying.
Look who just got bailed out.
You got a lot of balls,kid.
You nail my wife,you break up my
family,you burn down my business.
I didn't burn down your club.
And you can accuse me all you
want,but i'm not going to jail.
If i were you,i'd want to go there.
It's a hell of a lot safer.
Otherwise,someday,you'll be walking home
from school or work or your buddy's house,
and you'll just...Disappear.
Poof!
And if they ask me about it,you
know what i'm gonna tell 'em?
I was at the movies.
Enjoy your freedom.
Um,so right down the middle...
Okay.
No gutter balls.
Right.
They're getting along great,huh?
You're welcome.
I admit it. You being here
does seem to be helping.
You're welcome.
Okay,let it go.
God,look at him.
Remember when he needed one of those little
kiddie balls the size of a cantaloupe?
He's getting so big.
I know.
You know,that colts jersey you
bought him doesn't fit anymore.
No. God.
I'm gonna try it.
How did that little peewee we brought back
from the hospital turn into this bruiser?
Mike,i need you.
I got another split.
What did i say about aiming the ball?
I don't remember.
Come show me.
Um,be right there.
Hey there.
Do you have a second?
Now where did you get that?
A video store i will never return to.
Are you aware that one of
the stars of this film is--
Yes. I know about alex's movie,mom.
You do?
Yeah. He told me a long time ago.
He calls it the biggest
mistake he's ever ma.
Why
would he--
well,he couldn't afford
the tuition to med school,
And he was approached by this
so-called director,and well,he...
Anyway,i would appreciate it if
you didn't let on that you know.
And you're okay with this?
Yeah. Well,you know,i mean,we both know that
i have sort of an interesting past myself.
So,you know,uh,glass houses,stones.
Not to mention the fact
that i-i love him...
Very much.
So...
He's the one?
Yes,mom.
Even with his sordid past,he's the one.
Why did you bring this here?
You're going to marry him.
I thought he wasn't
being honest with you.
I wanted to protect you,so i- so
you decided to meddle in my love life?
Yes.
You know what,mom?
This might be about the nicest
thing you've ever done for me.
Come here.
I mean,not every boy can say that his
mother's willing to rent gay porn for them.
Yes.Which reminds me,that needs
to be back by 3:00.Could you?
Absolutely.
Uh,you gotta avoid those late fees.
Oh,you know,um,you know,i can have
alex autograph this for you if you want.
Just take it back.
Oh,mrs. Solis,may i
help you with something?
Get your boss.
There.
You got it back.
Why are you limping?
Fell off a table.
Don't want to talk about it.
What took you so long?
I just wanted to coach porter a
little bit before the arraignment.
What's he doing?
He needed some time to himself.
I'll meet you inside.
You might want to give him a moment.
I think he's pretty nervous.
That's because he's preston.
What?Oh,crap!
Hey,mom,dad.
Hey,preston.
Aw,you know?
Of course we know.
What the hell is going on?
Where's porter?
He took off.
What?
He was scared out of his mind.
He didn't know what to do,so he left town and
asked me if i'd help him give him a head start.
Do you have any idea how bad this is?
We had to post bail.
If the judge finds out porter
skipped town,we're gonna lose...
A lot.
Guys.
Guys,they're calling us.
Well,you know what?
He's gonna find out right now,because
you are not going in there.
I'd rather forfeit the bail than
risk having two of my kids go to jail.
Tom- no,bob will just tell
the judge what happened.
We'll take the hit and we'll
go forward.It's just money.
It's not just money.
What are you talking about?
Hey. Come on.
We're up.
Okay,look...
You know how you're always saying
i know what to do in a crisis?
Yeah.Here's what we're gonna do.
You--no
questions.
You--you're
porter now.
Let's go in.
Come on. Come on.
You like it?
It's beautiful.
Where'd it come from?
I bought it today.It's yours.
What?
We can't afford this.
I sold the baseball.
You never told me
things had gotten so bad.
You were blind and depressed.
I didn't wanna add to it.
Thank you for taking
such good care of us.
I plan on spending the rest
of my life making it up to you.
First thing tomorrow i'm selling my watch so i
can buy you some new shoes to go with that dress.
You should know that
watch is a knockoff.
I sold the real one two years
ago to get the roof fixed.
So how is katherine's foot?
Well,she's kinda got a psychedelic
toenail,but she'll be fine...
Which doesn'excuse what you did,mister.
What's going on?
Sweetie,if you're worried that i don't like
your daddy spending time with katherine,don't be.
I think it's great.
But they can't be together.
Why not?
'Cause you and mommy are
getting back together.
What?
That's what mommy said.
Hey,i've got an idea.
Why don't you go make a get
well card for katherine's foot?
Okay.
Okay.
I can totally explain this.I swear.
I'm listening.
It was--i don't know,uh,about
a month after you moved out.
It was bedtime.
I was trying to read to
him,but he only wanted you.
And he was crying so hard,and he kept asking me if you were
ever coming back,and so i finally...Said maybe you would.
I just didn't want him to be so sad.
Oh,susan.
I didn't even think he'd remembered it.
Of course he remembers it.
How could you say that to him?
Becausewehave never said it.
What?
We've never looked each other in the eye and said that
there is no chance we are ever getting back together.
O-okay.
Maybe we haven't,but we moved on.
Did we?
Susan,what are you doing?
You're with jackson now.
I'm with katherine.
What are you doing?
I don't know.
I...
You don't ever think about it?
I've gotta go check on katherine.
It's an awful thing to live in darkness,unable
to see what others take for granted.
But if we are lucky,the darkness lifts and we can
finally see the secret sacrifices made by our wives...
The surprising progress
made by our mothers...
Or the unintended consequences
of our own actions.
But there are those who prefer the darkness,because
there,they see only what they choose to see.
I know it must seem like
i've forgotten aut you,
but you have to know,i
think about you every day.
I live for you,just like always.
But i have a plan,so i hope
you can wait a little longer.
I'll be with you soon,but first mike
delfino has to pay for taking you away fr me,
and i need just the
right moment to do it.
He destroyed what i loved the
most,and i want him to feel that hurt.
I want him to lose what i lost.
Previously on...
do you do weddings?
Oh, my goodness. Are you two...
yes. Yes, we're getting married.
Oh, my god! Congratulations.
Those in love made the|next step... or tried to.
I need more from you.
gaby, I can see them.| That's wonderful!
Eyes were opened in|more ways than one...
the key is this doctor guy.
Maybe we should just bite|the bullet and go to boston.
You break up my family.|You burn down my business.
I didn't burn down your club.
And a thre was made.
Someday, you'll be walking home from|school, and you'll just disappear. Poof!
there are important events in|the history of every famY...
joyous births...
tragic deaths...
sublime weddings.
But the one event every family dreads|is the moment when they finally meet...
the in-laws.
Mom, this is alex's mom melina cominis.
It's a pleasure to meet you.
Likewise, and thanks again|for letting me stay here.
I just can't afford a motel right now.
oh, alex mentioned that you|were laid f from your job.
I'm so sorry.
Oh, that's okay. You know what|they say- in a bad economy,
the mature cocktail|waitress is the first to go.
Real? They say that?
Mom, we're gonna go get your luggage.|That way, you two can get acqunted.
Thank you again for making the|long drive down from oakdale.
It's high time our|families got together.
Absolutely.
Now speaking of family|get-togethers, that reminds me--
I call christmas.
What?
Now that the boys are getting hitched,|we're gonna ha to split the holidays, so...
I call christmas.
Wait, wait, wait. This is not how|we decide family get-togethers.
What's the problem? I'm|letting you have thanksgiving.
I'm a caterer. I oversee|events on thanksgiving.
It's the one holiday that I don't need.
Great. I call thanksgiving.
Stop that! You can't call|all the major holidays.
No one's called easter|yet. Going once...
I am not bidding on time with my son.| Going twice...
melina, this is childish!
My hand's going up.| Fine! I call easter.
That wasn't so hard, was it?
Look, I know it's very difficult for|two families to negotiate the holidays,
but I fe strongly that this is|not the best way to handle it,
and I'm sure that the|boys would agree with me.
I called christmas fair and square,|and I wanna spend it with my son.
So if you go to the boys|and try and screw me over,
I'll remember that for a|really long time. Got it?
Yes, there are important events|in the history of every family.
Meeting the in-laws is one.
Look at you two. Have I told you|how great you look together? Have I?
The moment you decide|to hate them is another.

Desperate|Housewives Season05 Episode11</font>
There's a home for everyone in suburbia,
and a realtor eager to find|you exactly what you want.
Whether it's something warm and cozy...
or something dignified and elegant...
or perhaps something|affordable with a porch.
Yes, everyone wants a home|with a lovely exterior,
mostly so the neighbors will never|suspect the ugliness going on inside.
There you are!
I just got the listing|for the adams house.
Ind I thk the best way to celebrate is|for my sexy husband to take me out dancing.
oh, babe. not tonight.
What's wrong? Are you sick?
No. No, uh... I'm good.
Really? 'Cause you look like hell.
I'm good, edie. I|just, uh... I-I just...
feel like staying in|tonight, that's all.
Ah, you're doing it again.
There is something upsetting you, and instead|of letting me help you, you're shutting me out.
I just don't like to|talk about my troubles.
and I don't like sitting at home|doing nothing when I feel like dancing.
Edie...
I am sorry you're unhappy.
There's something you|should know about me.
I don't stay unhappy for long.
hey, it's jackson, having|fun at the old alma mater.
We need to talk.
Only good news, I promise.
Did I mention miss you? Bye.
we moved here to get away from that.
i didn'T. I moved here for you.
I've got a deposition to prep for.
Well, then I will go|clubbing without you,
and I will be wearing my|"not coming home alone" jeans.
By "wearing," you mean "squeezing into"?
Damn you!
Miss anything? Need a juicy recap?
No. I'm good.
Boy, you just have to stick your|nose into other people's business.
I'm sorry. If you're|interested, I have dirt on bree.
Go on.
You're no better than I am.
Nicely played, mayer.| Thank you.
Can I go clubbing with you tonight?
Overplayed, mayer.
Oh, please! I'm bored.
Mike has M.J., Jackson's out of town, and|you're gonna need somebody to bitch about bob to.
You do realize I'm going to a gay club.
Yes, that's fine. Ys love me.
Name three.
You, bob, andrew.
Th's two.
Come on.| All right, all right!
Meet at my house at 9:00.
And you might wanna pile on the makeup.|Drag queens get their first drink free.
Okay, well, let's try something easier.
After you left mr. Schilling's|nightclub, where did you go first?
I don't recall.
Did you maybe drive somewhere?
okay, porter, when the D.A., O also has|this police report, asks you these questions,
and you suddenly "don't recall"|anything you said, that's bad.
Bob, you've been going at this for|over an hour. why don't we take a break?
Fine. Porter, go and chill. I need|to talk to your parents anyway.
okay, what's going on here?| Nothin'.
You know, porter's just nervous.
He was also nervous when I|first interviewed him in jail,
but he was still able to|keep his story straight.
preston! Where's my cd player?| what?
Parker saw you take it.
Mom, please tell preston|to stop taking my stuff.
Honey, that's porter.
No, it isn'T.
Right. Sorry.
You guys have something|you wanna tell me?
Gaby, you should've come.
You missed a beautiful walk in the park.
Mommy, look at what we found! A ladybug!
Neat!
Why don't you guys go|wash your hands for lunch?
Oh, look at her teeny black polka dots.
There's so many beautiful things I used|to take for granted before I lost my sight.
Yeah, pretty.
What? You're gonna be late for work.
Yeah, about that... I should've told you before...| what?
I don't want to give massages|anymore, so I quit the country club.
You quit? Why?
Okay, I know this is gonna sound bad...
when I was blind, I|never realized that...
naked people are gross, especially the|middle-aged slobs that belong to this country club.
Carlos, you don't just quit a job because|of a few moles and a little back fat.
But I can find other work.
Now that I have my vision|back, the world is my oyster.
In the meantime, I just wanna|spend a few days with my daughters
and smelling the roses,|soaking in nature.
Like that beautiful spider|right ther god's perfect design.
Isn't it amazing?
yeah, it sure is.
I'll get you the want ads.
what's all this?
Oh, andrew thought it would be nice|to have a formal dinner tomorrow night.
Well, if it's a formal dinner, why aren't|we using your grandmother's tablecloth?
For melina? She'd probably|blow her nose on it.
No, I will not let that|woman defile nana's lace.
I know melina isn't what|we hoped for, rely are.
Need I remind you of my mother?
Well, at least gloria had the good taste to have a|paralyzing stroke so we don't have to deal with her.
True. That was a merry christmas.
But melina appears to be|in tragically good health,
which means we've got quite a few|beer-drenched holidays ahead of us.
You have got to figure out|some way to be nice to her.
I don't know if I have it in|me. She's such a troglodyte.
Please.
No one's better at plastering on a fake smile|and pretending to like someone than bree hodge.
You're sweet.
oh, all right. Get the lace tablecloth.
I will pretend to like this woman.
just like pretended to like nana.
Bob, we're so sorry. We meant|to tell you. We really did.
So where the hell is porter?
We don't know.
That's why we've been trying to get you to|postpone the hearing date until we could find him.
Oh, we have a much bigger|problem than the hearing date.
What do you mean?
Well, now that I'm aware of this, I|have a legalbligation to report it.
What? No, no,|no, you can't--
Now my hands are tied.
But if the judge finds out that porter's|gone, we have to forfeit the bail.
And since my genius wife used|our restaurant to post bond,
our only source of income will vanish.
I feel for you guys. I really do.
But I'm not gettin disbarred over this.| Bob...
please. We're desperate.
I'm not meeting with the|D.A. For another two days.
If you find porter by|then, I won't say anything.
thank you so much.We|are so sorry that we--
just find him.
Yeah, yeah. I'm comin'.
gabrielle solis?|Bradley scott. Remember?
Carlos and I did some business|back in his finance days.
Oh, right! How are you?
Good. Maria and i finally gomarried.|I started my own investment fund.
How about yourself?
Good, good. I don't know if you|heard- carlos got his sight back.
Oh, my--my god.|I had no idea.
I know. Life is good.
now all we he to do is find him a job.
Well, your timing just|might be perfect here.
Why? You need someone?| As a matter of fac I dO.
Think he'd be interested?
I don't know. I-I|can't speak for carlos.
It's an upper-level position with lots of|perks and the salary's in the high six figures.
I'm now speaking for carlos. He'll take it.| Great.
I'd kill to have carlos on|my team. That man was a shark.
Have him call me.| Yeah.
so long, sucka.
Hello. Is dr. Heller in?
I'm sorry. He's not. Can I help you?
Not really. See, we ne to talk|to him about dave williams.
Dave williams?| Yeah. Dave is a patient of his.
I'm sure you know him- blond hair,|ue eyes, creepier than all get-out.
I'm not in a position to confirm that.
And I don't think the doctor would|discuss his patients with you either.
Oh, he'll talk to us.
Dave's been up to some pretty sick stuff...| yeah.
And I-I'm bettin' dollars to doughnuts|dr. Heller would wanna know all about it.
So when does he get here?
I couldn't say.
We'll wait.
Is that a beer?
We're not in a position to confirm that.
your new shoes are pretty.
Aren't they? Daddy bought them for|mommy- he doesn't know it yet--
because he has a wonderful new job.
He doesn't that yet either.
good news!| Me, too. Me first.
Remember bradley scott?
I ran into him today,|and he's giving you a job.
That'S... nice.
But that's what I wanted to tell you.
I just got a job.| fantastic!
Well, you didn't sign a|contract or anything, did you?
'Cause maybe we can get|them into a bidding war.
unlikely. It's at the counity center.
I'm gonna work with the blind.
Great.
And what's the signing bonus|for that--a cup of pencils?
I thought you were|gonna get a better job.
What happened to the|world being your oyster?
'S meaningful work.
Who cares? Bradley's offering perks.
What kind of perks is|this blind thing offering?
Hmm, let me think...
making the world a better|place, personal fulfillment.
Carlos, I've spent the last five|years working with the blind.
Trust me, it's not that fulfilling.
Look, when I lost my sight,|those people were there for me.
Ah, I just wanna give something back.
Not to mention... bradley scott?
Kind of an ass.
No way I'm working for that guy.
Hi, bradley, it's gaby solis.
I just talked to him,|and he's intrigued.
How would you like to come over|for dinner and seal the deal?
this is so fun! I|haven't been out in ages.
Tonight, I am|gonna...boogie-oogie-oogie
you really haven't been out in a while.
Go ahead. What do you want to drink?
Oh, I'll have what you're having.
Cirrhosis of the liver, coming right up.
hey, jackson. What?
Really?
Here you are.
yeah, just taking in the scenery.
You know, we actually have some very|comfortable patio furniture in the backyard...
along with a place to|put your recyclables.
No, I'm good here.
What have you two been up to?
Edie was shong us some houses.
I didn't know know you|two were house hunting.
Yes. We've got to get|out of that apartment.
Did edie show you the adams house?
She did, and it's fantastic.
And if we could figure out a way to|move it next to a toxic waste dump,
maybe we could afford it.
Holy moly, would you|look at these prices!
You know, for this kind of money, you could come|up to my town and get a 5-bedroom house on the lake.
I'm sure they could.
It's too bad your practice|is all the way down here.
It is now, but it's not like there|aren't sick people in oakdale.
Who, undoubtedly, already have doctors,|just like your patients in fairview have you.
Fine. Let them stay in|that teeny apartment.
Who cares if the other|doctors make fun of you?
You know, I think we|should talk about this.
You'd really like oakdale--|no traffic, fresh air.
Hey, I'm open. Maybe we can go up|there this weekend and look around.
what are you doing?
Just helping the boys|live the american dream.
I'll tell you what.
If the guymove up near me,|you can ha 'em for christmas.
I just wish there was some|way I could get back at bob.
I'm so sick of his smug attitude.
"I'm the provider. I|bring home the bacon."
Well, you know what? I contribute, too.
I handle the bills. I clean the house.
I thought you had a housekeeper.
Jeez, you're an ugly drunk.
Come on. It's a joke.|What's with the face?
I just... jackson called|earlier, and, um...
you know, he went to riverton to visit his|old art professor, and she offered him a job.
That's cool.
And he wants me to move there with him.
You gonna go?
Well... I wanna be with him, so...
I think I have to.
You're that serious about this guy?
Yeah. Sure. why not?
you sure you're not just|waiting for closing time?
What does that mean?
You know, 2:00 A.M., Bar's closing.
You haven't found the perfect guy, so|you settle for... something like that.
Oh, crap. Look away.|Look away. Look away.
Lee, that is not what I'm|doing. Is jackson perfect? No.
But I don't think there is such a thing, and|I have a history of sabotaging relationships.
no, I'm doing this. M moving.
Well, congratulations to you.
Scary guy's coming over.
I have to throw him off the scent. Do|you mind if I grab one of your boobs?
Knock yourself out.
Jazz!
Oh, my god! why didn't you wake me?
Bob is going to kill me.
But that was, uh, fun last night.
different, but fun. see ya.
*****In his english class,|the entire debate team.
Porter hasn't contacted any of them.
Well, hurry home. We gotta|decide what our next move .
All right. I love you. Bye.
preston, why didn't you pick up when I called you?| What?
I called you, like, five times.
No, you didn'T.| Yeah
see?You're not even on my callog.
hey, dude. Is mom still there?
Porter, it's mom. Where are you? Porter!
you know where he is!| I don'T. He won't tell me.
But you have been talking to|him. What the hell, preston?
I want my phone back.| Fine.
You know what you're|going to do with it?
You are going to call your|brother and tell him to come home.
He's not coming home.
Mr. Schilling threatened to kill him.
What? What?
That's why he ran away?
I thought he was|afraid of going to jail.
Well, I'm sure warren schilling|was just tryinto scare h.
It worked! Rter's terrified!
Okay, we'll get a--we'll|get a restraining order.
I don't think that's|gonna stop this guy.
I can handle warren schilling.
But if porter doesn't show up for|court, we're gonna lose our restaurant!
A guy threatens to kill your son,|and that's what you're worried about?
No, I'm not gonna let my brother risk|his life so you and dad can sell pizza.
how do you sleep with|someone and not remember?
I don't know. I was drunk.
Okay, let's skip to the|important part--who was it?
Just a friend.
Oh, gaby, do you think I did this subconsciously|just to sabotage my relationship with jackson?
It was tom scavo, wasn't it?
Will you stop guessing? Oh, god!
Why won't I just let myself be happy?
Was it lou?
My mechanic? Are you crazy?
Come on. You were with a|plumber and a housepainter.
I mean, let's face it- you|like your service providers.
susan, you home?| Bob!
uh, what are you doing here?
Well... it's about lee.
He told me he took you out last night.
Yes. Uh, we had a very|nice, uneventful evening.
Why? what did he say?
'Cause he was pretty drunk, so he|was... probably making stuff up.
Well, he didn't come home. He|claims he spent the night here.
oh, my god.
Oh, hi, gaby. I didn't|know you were here.
Never mind her. She was just leaving.
No. I think I should|stay and clean this up.
It's A... huge mess.
Uh, bob... uh, lee did|stay here last night.
he slept on the couch...|in the guest room.
So you have nothing to worry about.
Oh, thank god.
I just had this awful feeling that|he spent the night with another man.
wolee uldn't do that. He loves you.
I know he does, but he's|got a few drinks in him,
he'll bang anything with|a pulse and facial hair.
You still haven't heard from him?
For the 17th time... no.
Where does she get off|having all that attitude?
She's young and pretty, and we're not.
She's not that pretty.
I can hear every word you're saying.
From all the way over|there? Boy, she is young.
look, I'm very tired, so|I'm going to break the rules.
Dr. Heller went on some sort of trip.
He should've been back a week|ago, and I don't know where he is.
Why didn't you tell us|that in the first place?
Because it's none of your business!
hello? Dr. Heller's office.
Uh, hey. It's david dash. Is he in?
Did you hear that? He should've|been back by now. Why isn't he back?
I'm sorry, mr. Dash.|Dr. Heller's out of town.
What are you saying?
You think dave has something to do|with heller being late from vacation?
Don't ask me why, but I got a|feeling there's a connection.
Well, can I still get|a prescription refilled?
Re. Dr. Lybrand's on call.
Could you see him tomorrow ound 2:00?
Actually, I've moved.
You know what?| What?
I'm done.
Meaning what?
I'm sure we can work it|out. What's your new adess?
What, you're just gonna abandon me?
I went on this wild goose|chase as far as I could.
Oh, don't--please don't go,|roberta. I need your help.
Then get somebody else. I'm tapped out.
Roberta, wait!
"Wisteria lane." What a lovely name.
bree, you sure there isn't|anything I can do to help?
I'm just standing here|with my thumb up my butt.
Uh, no help needed. Certainly|nothing that would ruire your thumb.
Uh, sorry we're late. We|got hung up at the realtors.
Actually, you're right on|time. We're just about to eat.
Shall we?| Yeah.
Excuse... excuse me,|melina. That's my chair.
I just wanted to sit next to the boys.
Well, did it occur to you I might|want to sit next to the boys?
Did it occur to you|that I already called it?
She did. She called it.
Why don't you sit re, bree?
guess who just called|the burnt lamb chop?
I just wanted to see the look on your|faces when you heard my good news.
Really? What is it?
Well, I told dr. Hardy|you're moving to oakdale.
Uh, thinking about it. They're|thinking about moving to oakdale.
Not after they hear this.
Anyway, he's retiring next month, and he thinks|you'd be perfect to take over his practice.
Are you serious?
Wow, this could be a|good opportunity for us.
Yes. A good opportunity for andrew|to commute ve hours to his job.
I don't know, alex. This is|all happening pretty fast.
But it's the only way we're|gonna be able to afford a house,
and if we're gonna have kids...| you're gonna have kids?
Oh, this is perfect! I can|look after them for you!
Let's toast to seal the|deal. Here's to oakdale.
I bought you the adams house!
What?| What?
What?
It was going to be a surprise,|you know, for your wedding.
Unfortunately, this whole silly oakdale|thing has forced me to show my hand.
Mom, that's too generous.
Yes, that's, uh... that's way too|generous. You shouldn't do that.
Oh, it's nothing you wouldn't do.
Bree, I don't know|what to say, except...
thank you so much.
I really love you for this.| Oh, and I love you, too.
Orson, dear, would you pour|melina another glass of wine?
calling edie, are you?| you know it.
hi, honey.
You remember bradley and his wife maria.
They dropped by for dinner.
How fun.
Can I ask you something|about the trash cans?
Excuse me.
what is that miserable S.O.B.Doing here?
I already took the job|at the community center.
I know. Just listen to|what bradley has to say,
and if at the end of the evening you're still|not interested, I support you completely. Deal?
If it'll get you off my back... deal.
After I got concessions from the union,|I laid off a third of the workforce,
outsourced another third.
A year later, I sold the company|for twice what I paid for it.
Impressive. Huh, carlos?
Very. It'll be a great story to|tell all the other C.E.O.S in hell.
Carlos, be nice.| No, it's fine.
Just taking care of my kids.
Yeah. I've got a picture|of them in my purse.
Wanna see how many you can name?
More wine, maria?
So, bradley, if carlos were to come work|for you, what would a typical week look like?
Oh, lots of high-end deal|making, uh, international travel.
oh, yeah. We travel all|over the world together.
It is so fun sitting|alone in a five-star hotel
while your husband is out crushing the|third world under the heel of his jackboot.
You hear that, carlos?|Five-star hotels.
Listen, bradley, really appreciate|the offer, but I told you--
I already have a job.
Why can't you do your work|with the deaf on the weekends?
First of all, because they're blind.
You tell him.
um, honey, bradley's right.
You could take this job and do|your charity work in your free time.
No, don't listen to her.
You are a good man, and you|are going to help people.
And even if you never|end up making a penny,
you'll be worth more than|this soulless bastard.
I work very hard to provide for you and|the kids, and I would like a little respect.
We, you know what i would like?
A big divorce.
so...
is eye care included in the health plan?
'Cause that's obviously|a big issue for carlos.
daddy misses you so much.
I'm so sorry. okay? Bye-bye!
I miss you two so|much. very soon, honey.
It's just a little teeny bit longer.
Oh, my little girl.|You look so beautiful.
I've missed you so much.|We're gonna be together soon.
I promise you. Just a teeny|little bit. It'll be fine.
Dave?
I'm sorry. You scared me.
Who were you talking to?
No one.
I heard you.
Edie, please, j--|I'm not feeling well.
Who the hell were you talking to?
leave me alone.
why did you turn down here?
I thght we were going to the store.
mom, what is this place?
Before I became a mother,
I didn't know it was possible to love|another human being so completely,
and with that love comes|this need to protect you.
It wasn't a decisiit'S... pral.
It's just something in my D.N.A.
Whatever it is, it makes|me not care about myself,
and it reminds me that my|reason for being on this planet
is to look after you kids.
Why are you telling me this?
Yesterday, you said warren schilling|will kill porter if he gets the chance.
I will never let that happen.
Mom, where are we?
You see that bar?
Warren schilling goes there every night.
Tonight, when he leaves...
I'm gonna do what I have to,|to make sure my family is safe.
So...
I need you to get out now.
You can't be in the|car when this happens.
Are you serious?
You're gonna run him over?
Like I said, it's in my D.N.A.
that could be him.
Get out.
Get out! Get out!| Okay! Stop it! I get it!
I'll call porter and tell him he doesn't|have to worry about mr. Schilling.
And you will convince|him to come back home.
Shut the door.
so... remember how you said|I just had to hear bradley out,
and then whatever I|decided, you'd support me?
Well, you may be surprised, but|I am ready to render my decision.
Let me lay it|out for you--
either I do something fulfilling where I|help other people and feel good out myself,
or I take a job I hate where I make a lot of|money, but it eats my life and crushes my soul.
Hang on. Before you do that,|let me lay it out for you.
Either you let your family continue to|sacrifice so you can feel good about yourself,
or you grow up and make real money
and look after us like we've been|looking after you for the past five years.
You know what these jobs are like, gaby.
I'd never be home.
And when I was, I'd|be tired or irritated.
It will take a toll on all of us.
It took a toll on us when we|couldn't pay the s bill, carlos.
It took a toll on us when juanita was sent|home from day care because the check bounced.
But I handled it, and now|it's your turn to handle it.
Gaby, please don't make me do this.
bradley? Hey, it's carlos.
Well, I've, uh, done some|thinking, and I actually...
I wa that job, if it's|still on the table.
yeah. I was surprised, too.
sounds great.
See you monday.
hey, susan. I just made tea. Come on in.
Lee, um...
well, there's just no|graceful way to ask this, so...
I'm just gonna say it straight out.
When you spent the|night, did we get it on?
ye gods, no. Are you insane?
So... nothing happened between us?
Hello? Gay! Listening|to opera in a kimono.
What more do you need to know?
oh, thank god.
You know, when I woke up next to you|yesterday, I just didn't know what to think.
But why would you think that?
'Cause you were mad at bob,
and I told you about how I|sometimes sabotage my relationships.
Well, u didn'T. Not this time, anyway.
Yay.
now I can move in with jackson|with a clear conscience.
good. Good. -|Wait, so I just--
I have to ask.Why exactly are|you moving in with jackson?
Because... he loves me.
Do you love him?
I'm getting there.
Don't you think maybe you|should... wait until you've arrived?
Mike and I will never get|back together. I know that now.
And i really need to|move on with my life.
You know moving on doesn't|have to mean moving in.
Jackson has made it pretty clear that he|doesn't do good with long-distance relationships.
I could lose him.| So lose him.
I'm not good alone.|I ne a man in my life.
But why? We're so useless.
But you are fun to dance with.
I think you should tell|jackson you're not ready.
Anif he ends up leaving, then,|hell, i will dance with you.
At least until someone better|comes along. How does that sound?
If this is your attempt at|bedding me again, miss mayer,
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.
mom really wants to talk to|you, just for five seconds.
Do it for me, okay?
Sweetie, where are you?| I don't want to tell you.
Porter... you have got to come home.|Everything will be fine. I promise.
How? Either warren schilling|kills me, or I end up in jail.
We can get a restraining|order to protect you,
and bob thinks there's a good|shot at getting the case dismissed.
You know, I've been reading|the fairview papers online.
Everybody thinks I did it.
There is not a shred|of evidence against you.
When people see that, they will|be on your side just like we are.
Sweetie, you have to trust me.
I do trust|you.It's just I--
don't fall for it, kiddo.
I trusted her once, and|look where it got me.
Good morning.| Is it?
I didn't get a lot of sleep.
Okay, about last night, I'm sorry.
Let me stop you right there.
I don't need an apology.|I need an explanation.
and... if you can't give me one...
I'm thinking we're finished.
Look, I'm just stressed out.
Stress doesn't make you talk|to people who aren't there.
What is going on?
Okay.
Before we met, I was|married to someone else.
But she died.
And last night she was...
sort of on my mind.
You were married before?
She's dead, edie. What does it matter?
Oh, it matters.
You have until tonight to|get your things together.
Then I want you out of my house.
Everyone needs a|lovely home in suburbia,
mostly so the neighbors will never|suspect what's going on inside.
Behind these freshly painted|walls you will find...
parents wracked with guilt...
wives tired of struggling...
lovers who have been lied to...
yes, everybody needs a|lovely home in suburbia...
if for no other reason|than to have a place...
to come home to.

Previously on...
a call was made.
Sweetie, where are you?
I don't wanna tell you.
And if porter doesn't show up for
court, we're gonna lose our restaurant!
A guy threatens to kill your son,
and that's what you're worried about?
And as one love affair
blossomed, another...
you were married before?
She's dead.
I want you out of my house.
Withered on the vine.
Mike delfino has to pay
for taking you away from me.
I want him to lose what I lost.
it had been a long
journey for david williams,
and though it began years ago,
he remembered every step of it...
walking outside his front door to find
a policeman with news of a car crash...
running into the hospital only to be
told his wife and daughter had died...
no! No! Let go of me!
being dragged into a psychiatric
facility after his mental breakdown...
no!
Strolling into a hotel
weeks after being released
and bumping into a beautiful blonde...
marcng down the aisle with a
woman who, as it turned out,
once lived on the same street with
the man who had killed his family.
But his bride was now unhappy,
and dave williams was worried that his
dream of revenge had been destroyed.
Luckily for dave, fate was about
to take some steps of its own.
Hey, dave! What's going on?
Edie and I had a fight.
I take it you're giving
her time to calm down?
No, I think I'm looking for a place to
stay while she's looking for a lawyer.
Oh, man, I...
wanna say something helpful,
but all I got is "that sucks."
That it does.
So where are you headed?
Oh, it's such a nice night, I thought
I'd walk to at motel on the interstate.
Might as well enjoy the stars
while my life falls apart.
it's getting late, and so, uh...
hey, why don't you stay with me?
Really? I, uh...
I wouldn't want to impose.
Dave, you saved my life.
I owe ya.
Well, now that you
mention it, I guess you do.
come on in.
And just like that, dave's
dream of revenge was salvaged...
lead the way, roomie.
And he started to feel his
long journey would soon be over.

Desperate
Housewives Season04 Episode12</font>
At 9:02 the next morning...
edie williams began calling her friends to let
them know something humiliating had happened to her.
By 9:06, her friends
had begun to arrive,
just so they could
hear the juicy details.
So he was married before.
You don't kick a man out for that.
no. but you do for never mentioning it.
And especially when I
laid out mentire past.
Emphasis on the word "laid."
Exactly. Gaby gets it.
Well, maybe they were only together a short
time, and she didn't mean anything to him.
I doubt it, since he walks
around muttering to her ghost.
You know what would lift your spirits?
We should all do a spa weekend.
Yeah! Let's do that.
Oh, I appreciate the offer, but I think
I'm better off gettinlost in my work.
Well, maybe I can help you.
Think you can rent my house out?
What?
Jackson got a teaching job at
the college in riverton, and...
I'm going with him.
Uh, wait, you're moving?
I know it's sudden, but I
feel really good about this.
And it's only two hours away, so it'll
still be like we're practically next door.
I am so happy for you,
but we're gonna miss you.
Oh, don't worry about
us. Jackson is so great.
You are making the right choice.
Absolutely. Come here, you!
I can't believe you're leaving.
When you're done here,
you wanna come do my lawn?
Well, I figure since mike's letting me
crash here, it's the least I could do.
Well, that's very nice... and brave.
Mike takes a lot of pride in his yard.
Yeah.
Look at his roses.
Every time I walk by here,
I just want to steal one.
Here, let me cut you one.
Oh, no. Couldn'T.
He wouldn't like that.
Hey, you. What's up?
Not much. Got a call from dylan.
Hehusband's traveling more for his business, and
she doesn't have anybody to help her with the baby.
She's trying to pushe
to move out to baltimore.
So, uh, what'd you say?
Oh, just that I'd think about it.
What do you think I should do?
Well, she really needs your help.
I guess you should help her.
Well, I don't know that
she need it. Honestly?
I think she's just lonely.
of course... it would
be nice to be closer.
But is that a good enough reason
to uproot my whole life here?
What do you think?
I'm not sure. It's up to you.
I know. I just... thought
you might have an opinion.
oh, shoot. I'm, uh, expecting
a call from a supplier.
I'll, uh, I'll talk to you later.
on second thought, I'm sure
he won't even notice it's gone.
Of will require an updated irrigation
system, which I'm happy to take care of.
Bree, you bought us a house. We
can't let you do all this, too.
Nonsense! It's a small price to pay
to make your home more beautiful.
I insist.
-yes!
It's gonna be here tomorrow.
Orson, take it easy!
impossible.
Soon, I, the grillmaster, will
christen a brand-new barbecue.
You're pretty excited about a grill.
Oh, it's so much more
than that, young man.
This is the prairiefire turbo.
It's 122,000 btus of charbroiling power.
Look out, cattle!
You think you're excited? Just imagine
the salesman who overcharged you.
Well, bree, I got a very good deal.
He only thinks he got a good deal because the
salesman threw in one of those "kiss the cook" hats.
And the temperature-sensing
rbecue fork.
Well, that sounds good.
Yeah.
Don't encourage him!
Orson is a horrible negotiator.
He's never met a sticker
price he didn't like.
Oh, no, bree,
that's-  it's true.
There's a reason the local car dealers send
you a fruit basket every christmas. W hush.
bree, could you please not do that?
Do... do what?
It's just...
when you talk to your husband that
way, it really pushes a button for me.
My mom used to do that, and it, uh...
drove my dad away.
I think he was tired
of being emasculated.
Did I mention it has a
rear-mounted rotisserie rack?
what exactly are you saying, alex?
I'm saying, if you're gonna be rude to your
husband, could you just not do it in front of me?
So rotisserie, huh?
Yeah. Good for chicken,
rolled roasts, legs of lamb.
This thing is so advanced, I
could obably use it to make soup.
I'm sorry. Daddy has to work.
Carlos, what is going on?
You're gonna miss your plane.
They're upset. They're
not used to me being away.
Oh, for god sakes, girls. It's
not like he's going off to war.
He's gonna be back tomorrow.
Why can't daddy work here?
Because daddy has a new job
that's gonna make us lots of money.
We don't need lots of money.
Hey, what did I say about
that kind of language?
Look, gis...
Daddy's gonna be home
tomorrow in time for dinner.
You can call me whenever youant. Okay?
And the best part is you get to
spend a whole day with just mommy!
heoh, llo, mr. Fishmanan.
I'm coming in. Watch the wheels.
Boy, you just had to
put a rug here, huh?
Uh, is everything okay?
It's about your damn son.
Porter?
How the hell do I know?
He's got red hair and he's got a face you just
wanna slap, and he's driving my sister crazy!
What are you talking about?
The retirement home.
Your kid has been staying
in your mom's room.
What?
Muriel thought he was just visiting,
but he's been there for a week.
Now the rules clearly state...
no visiting after dark.
Tom, I know where porter is.
He's hiding at my mother'S.
Oh, hiding, my ass. He's not
hiding. He's living there.
He even stole my sister's orange juice.
I'll take re of it. Thank you.
Call bob. Tell him we can
make the hearing tomorrow.
Nobodyan sleep there because he's
got that tv blaring all night long.
Look, tom, I can't
talk now. Just call bob.
I'm going over there now. Okay. Bye.
parker, I'm gonna be back in an hour.
Mr. Fishman, thank you so much.
well, don't just stand there.
Make me a sandwich!
Uh, one more thing. Could you see
about having the basement cleared out?
Yeah, e last time we went down there,
it was filled with mildewed boxes.
Oh, I'll take care of that.
There's nothing worse than
having old junk around.
Edie!
Case in point.
edie?
edie! Do you not hear me?
Yeah, I heard you.
Why do you think I kept walking?
Looks like the mailman switched
our mail again. Do you have mine?
Yep. T's in my garbag come by
and grab it at your convenience.
What is wrong with you?
I asked everyone over this morning because I had
this huge thing to share about kicking my husband out,
and you prance in with your, "me and
jackson are moving to a fairy castle."
I'm sorry.
I thought we gave your latest breakup
the three seconds of shock it deserved.
Get the hell out of here.
Gladly.
what have you done?
nothing. It's locked.
do you have a key?
In my purse.
Which I left in the kitchen.
Does anyone know you're here?
No.
Help!Get me out of here!
Somebody help me!
juanita, it's time for your bath.
I'm watching my movie.
You've seen it a hundred times.
She loses her shoe, the prince
finds it--end of story. Let's go.
I'll go when I'm ready.
hey, it's not finished!
It is for you. Now move!
Juanita solis, I am not kidding.
Okay. That does it. Juanita.
If you think I'm not gonna drag you
to the throom, you are sadly mistaken!
You're never gonna make it.
Oh, yes, I will.
My rage is fueling me in
ways you can't imagine.
what's wrong?
My rage just needs to catch its breath.
okay. Okay.
I am willing to forget this entire incident
if you just go jump in that bathtub right now.
What do you say?
I am gonna scrub that smug
look right off your face.
Oh, my back!
where is he?
I'm sorry. Have we met?
wait...
you're the girl who stuck
me here three years ago.
You come by every christmas
and look at yo watch
while I unwrap the socks you
bought me on the drive over.
Do you know what's going on with
porter? The fire? The arrest?
Yes. I read the newspapers.
Everybody's ying for
that poor kid's blood.
No, no. We have this great lawyer.
He thinks he can get
the case thrown out.
Oh, really? I didn't realize that.
porter! Come out from under the bed!
Mommy is here to take care of you!
Just like she took care of me.
Okay. I know you're mad.
I know we have a lot
to hash out between us.
But don't take your hate
for me out on your grandson.
Now where is he?
He's safe.
I heard muriel fishman
rat me out to her brother,
so I-I made sure that
porter cleared out.
Mom... this is wrong. Please.
Sucks to feel powerless,
doesn't it, lynette?
Please, help!
Please!
I'm getng a really unpleasant picture
of what u're like in the ol' sackarooni.
Face it, mer. We're stuck.
Gotta get out.
I'm supposed to be
meeting the moving company.
what?
Keep talking about how you're going
to move away and be with jackson.
I ar stupidi makes time go faster.
So now me wanting to be with
the man I love is stupid?
And needy and pathetic
and... kinda hilarious.
But there's one thing it's not, mayer.
That's "unexpected."
What are you getting at?
Have you ever in your
life been without a man?
Of course I have.
When?
I don't know. I'm not sure.
What are you doing?
making a calendar.
Edie...
oh, come on. We've got nothing but time,
and I assume you don't wanna make out, so...
first boyfriend?
Todd shaffer. I was 14.
And why did you and hot toddy break up?
He dumped me during math class.
And how long did it take you
to start dating somebody else?
This is a stupid
exercise.I refuse to--
when was it?
Lunch. It was lunch.
You know, I'm feeling
a bit randy tonight.
What do you say we make a little love?
Well, we've got 15 minutes
till the news is on. Why not?
I still can't get over the
way alex behaved this morning.
"Emasculating." I' never
heard such nonsense.
Don't you think so?
Well, I thought the matter in which
alex made his point was inappropriate.
But?
Well, I wouldn't say it was nonsense.
You can be a little tough sometimes.
"Tough"? That's not a word I
would use to describe myself.
Nobody blames you, bree. You run a
business. You have to be formidable.
Sometimes, if that frame of mind
carries over into your personal life,
it's only to be expected.
I don't think I do that.
I know you don'T.
It's not worth getting upset about.
Andrew and I are used to it, and I'm sure
in time, alex will get used to it, too.
Now... on to more pleasant things.
Even though it's my turn, I
don't mind if you're on top.
I think we forgot one.
Didn't you date somebody after
you stole karl away from me?
Ron. Dr. Ron.
Are we done?
Yep.
Here it is--the history
of your love life.
Proof that you can't
be happy without a man.
This is not proof of anything.
Seven boyfriends through high
school and college- only...
41 days single.
What does that tell you?
My grades sucked?
It's a cry for help, mayer.
and it doesn't get much better into
the many decades of your adulthood.
Hey, I was single for several
months after karl and after mike.
But that wasn't of your
choosing. They dumped you.
I know. It's hard to look in the mirror.
Have you ever looked
in your mirror, edie?
You're famous for the number
of men you've conquered.
Thank you.
It's not a compliment, you tramp!
Okay, i am not gonna take relationship
tips from a woman who has hooked up with...
what is it? Over a thousand men?
Okay, that's tE.I enjoyed the '80s
but the difference is, I go
after men because I want them.
You go after them because you need them.
That is not much of a distinction.
Yes, it is.
You have holes in your heart that can
only be filled by a pair of trousers.
Face it, mayer. You're weak.
porter wasn't there, and she
won't tell me where he is.
did you tell her that
he could end up in jail?
Of course I did.
Lynette, you're really upset.
Just hang up and come home.
She's so angry at me.
She's never gonna tell us where he is.
lynette? Lynette?
uh, we need to find lynette scavo.
Let me check.
This is all my fault.
She was so worked up
when she left my room.
I'm not finding a lynette scavo.
Oh, my god. Does that mean she's dead?
No. No.
It means she outsmarted her mom.
Oh, my god, porter,
we missed you so much.
I-I don't understand. I
thought you were in an accident.
No, sweetie. I was driving home last
night, talking with your dad on the phone,
and two cars in front
of me had an accident.
And I thought, damn, that could be me.
And then I thought, that could be me.
You scared the hell out of me.
We are sorry, but we had to get you
back. You've gotta be in court by 5:00.
I don't want to go to jail.
Porter, listen to me.
Bob talked to the judge.
He thinks he can get
them to drop the charges.
I don't know if I should believe you.
You're gonna have to.
Okay.
great. Come on. Let's go.
That was a rotten
thing you did, lynette.
I thought you were dead.
Yeah, well, what can I tell
ya? I learned from the best.
celia! Juanita!
I am not gonna ask you again
to pick up these clothes!
You've got till the count of three!
One... two... three!
You can hear me, right?
yeah!
All right, that's it!
I'm calling your father!
You are gonna get it now!
He is gonna tear into you!
It is gonna be a bloodbath!
hey, babe. What's up?
It's your children. They've run amok.
What?
Now that you've gone back to
work, they won't listen to me.
They know you're not in the next room,
ready to drop the hammer. Help me!
How? I'm in a meeting.
O-okay. I'm gonna put you on speer,
and I want you to rip 'em a new one.
I'm with clients. I
don't have time for this.
But- -
I gotta go!
Carlos? Carlos!
I think he hung up, mommy.
Can you bring us a lemonade?
hi, mike.
Hey, sorry I'm late.
Where's katherine?
Ah, headache. She ses her regrets.
you mind if I grab a beer?
Uh, yeah. In the test kitchen.
Uh, beer sounds good. I think
I'll grab one, too. Excuse me.
So... katherine not feeling well, huh?
Yeah. Yeah, I think she also
might be a little miffed with me.
this about baltimore?
it's not that I want her
to go, 'cause I don'T.
They why don't you tell her?
I don't wanna be the guy that comes between her
and her daughter, not to mention a grandchild.
I thought this was
because... I don't know.
Maybe you're still
hung up on your ex-wife.
Susan? No. No, that's over.
You sure?
And most guys I talk to, they say
they only really fall in love once.
And even if it doesn't work, they spend the rest of
their lives thinking about the one that they lost.
I always wondered if that's
how you felt about susan.
Why would you wonder
about something like that?
Oh, I don't know. You're
my friend. I care about you.
well, no.
In fact, dave, I think I might
be falling in love with katherine.
Did you just use the "l" word?
See, I-I didn't realize
it was that serious.
Ll, to be honest, it didn't really
hit me until she said she might leave.
Where are our guests?
The food's gonna get cold.
Oh, I'll go find them.
And bring some steak sauce.
Oh, you're not gonna need
any sauce with these babies.
They are seasoned to perfection.
bring it.
Well, there's no sense
in waiting. Dig in.
Oh, dear. Are they overcooked?
No, they're well-done.
That's the way I like them.
Bree, what do you think?
Oh, I really couldn't say.
You couldn't say if
your meat is overcooked?
No. I wouldn't want to upset anyone.
Well, don't rrY. You won't upset me.
I don't think she was referring to you.
Well, it's just that grilling
is suca manly pastime.
If I suggested that orson somehow
failed to produce the perfect steak,
you might see it as another
example emasculation.
I see. You're not gonna
let that go, are you?
Well, for all I know, telling orson his steak
tastes like charcoal might be deballing him.
You know, bree, you can make
your point and still be nice.
You know what else would be nice, alex?
Showing gratitude when people
have been generous with you.
Don't listen to her,
alex. She's not mad at you.
She's mad at me... and the meat.
Gratitude? What do you mean by that?
I mean I bought you a house.
You'd think you'd show
me a little respect.
seriously? You're bringing up the house?
Well, why not? It was a fairly
grand gesture on my part.
Yes, and one that apparently
comes with strings.
If by "strings," you mean I won't let you
be rude to me in my own house, then yes.
You know wha I think I'm going to
have to decline your grand gesture.
Keep the hse.
What's wrong?
Orson burnt the steaks.
Susan, how can you tell
if pickles have botulism?
Ah, what the hell? I shoot
this stuff into my forehead.
Forget it. I'd rather
starv for a day or two.
By then, you'll be dead, and I can use
your remains as a source of protein.
Oh, come on. That was funny.
You know... maybe i do feel
incomplete without a man.
But I... wouldn't trade places with
you for anything. You wanna know why?
No, but I'm trapped,
so knock yourself out.
It's the way you are with
men- they're like tissues.
You use one and then toss it awa
and then you're on to the next one.
At least I'm looking for something al.
so you think this happy ending
crap that you believe in is real?
Please. I know what men are really like.
Really?
Well, when I was 16, my dad had an affair
with this woman who had a 10-year-old daughter.
And one day, he told my mom and
me that he was leaving us for them.
Oh, my god.
No talking.
A week later, he comes to
the house to get his stuff,
and my mom didn't want to see
him, so we went to the movies.
Now I had this, uh,
horse figurine collection.
Plastic, glass, ceramic--
hundreds of them.
Anyway, we come back from the movies,
and my dad had taken all his stuff.
So... I go into my bedroom,
and something seems different.
And then I realize all
of mhorses were gone.
My mom called my dad and
screamed and all he said was,
I was too old for th and that his girlfriend's
daughter would appreciate them more.
can you believe that? What a fungus.
oh, god. Are you crying?
it's just... now I get it.
Get what?
All these years, I
have judged you, and...
it is not your fault. Oh, come here.
you are the way you are
because of your father.
Edie, what the hell?
Don't psychoanalyze me, you simp!
I was just trying to tell
you how selfish men are.
And I was just trying to be nice and give
you a free pass for being such a big slut!
Edie!
Okay, girls. Pick up your toys and
put 'em in the basket before dinner.
Dinner's not for two hours.
I've had enough of your
crap. Now pick up these toys!
No!
Okay, juanita. What is going on
here? Why are you being so difficult?
When daddy asks you to do
something, you just do it.
That's because I love daddy mo.
Fine.
everything okay, mrs. Solis?
Yeah. just my kids.
They really know how push my buttons.
Oh, yeah. I got a couple
monsters at home, too.
The key is, you gotta
be the bigger monster.
Well, unfortunately,
they're not afraid of me.
Ooh, that's bad. Fear is the
foundation of all good parenting.
You gotta practice your big voice.
finish that broccoli now!
you see how that works?
Yeah. It's very effective.
well...
hey, you got an extra 15 minutes?
do it! Faster! Faster! Faster!
I wanna see this place sparkle!
Mommy...
it's out of my hands, girls.
Word got out that you were
disobeying, and they sent reggie over.
Who sent reggie over?
Well, I know how much
you love him, but...
it was your daddy.
Enough chatter. Ke moving!
when they're done, you
want me to make them vacuum?
If you wouldn't mind.
Nah.
Gues
aw, come on, edie. I said I was sorry.
Guess
July?
Wrong. March!
Man, you're bad at this.
Guess.
oh, hey, mrs. Williams. I
didn't know you were down here.
Oh, thank god! We've been
locked in here all night.
Really? Good thing I came by
to check the rat traps then.
I'm glad I forgot about those until now.
uh, mayer?
I, uh, would appreciate it if you
wouldn't talk about what we talked about.
I wasn't planning to.
Good, because I'll deny it if you do.
I won'T.
And... I'll kill you.
Good-bye, edie.
oh, I'll bring your mail
over when I get home.
Thks.
Hey, mom.
I just came by to tell you that the judge
threw out porter's case for lack of evidence.
Isn't that great?
Mom...
I did not put you in here to punish you.
I didn't have a choice.
You had a choice.
No, I didn'T.
From the moment glen died,
u were out of control.
It's true you lost all
that money in vegas.
You started drinking again.
D how many times did I go to your condo,
only to finyou asleep on the sofa
with a cigarette in your mouth?
No, I won't apologize
for bringing you here.
I did it because I love you.
Then why don't you come visit me?
It's not a very pleasant experience.
So I yell a little.
So I toss a few curse
words your way. Big deal!
Last time I came, you
threw pudding at me.
I'm an angry old woman,
lynette! What do you expect?
Here's a thought--
stop being angry.
How?
I can't make a friend in this place without having
them drop dead of a stroke five minutes later.
I-I feel like hell. Every time I
look in the mirror, I wanna scream.
My anger is all I've got left, baby.
If I let go of that,
it's over. I know it.
The ball game will be over.
The ball game is going to end
whether you like it or not.
I would like to be here with you
for whatever time you have left.
But for that to happen,
things have to change.
Would you come visit me more often?
At least twice a week, and
sometimes I'd bring the kids.
I'd like that. You know,
they turned out really good.
How'd you learn how
to be such a good mom?
I have no idea.
Well, now that you're here, why don't
you stay, and we can talk a while?
I--and get my flask
out of the drawer.
Hey, I can't be nice, forgiving
and sober all at the same time.
Daddy!
daddy!
Missed you guys.
You're really helping
mommy, huh? That's great.
The scary man told us we had to.
We don't even know the guy.
He left a flier in our mailbox.
You left him do your parenting?
Hey, you're the one who
told me to get creative.
This wasn't what I meant!
Easy for you to say.
They told me they love you more than me.
And when I was running things,
they said they loved you more.
Really?
So don't get your feelings hurt, and stop
asking strangers to discipline our kids.
Well, I wouldn't have
to if you would do it.
so you want me to go twork all
day, go out on business trips,
and what little time I have here with the
girls, you want me to spend screaming at them?
Just for the first 15 minutes
after you walk in the door.
Then it's carlos time.
Forget it! This was the arrangement
you wanted. You made me take this job.
I just wanted us to have a normal life.
Well, guess what, sweetie?
Dad's unhappy at work.
Mom's home with the
screaming kids. You got one.
Oh, good. You're back.
Can we talk?
If it's about work, yes.
If it's about what happened
at the barbecue, no.
Fine.Then as my employee,
I authorize a 5-minute break so we
can talk about my son's boyfriend
and his absurd
overreaction this afternoon.
Th's it. I'm out of here.
Andrew, please. You were there.
Alex started the whole thing.
You need to tell him
to stop criticizing me.
I'm--I'm not getting
in the middle of this.
If you have a problem
with alex, you tell him.
I tried. He won't listen to me.
Don't you mean obey?
He's not your son. He's not your
husband. He's not your employee.
Not everyone has to listen to you.
I'll--I'll do
this tomorrow.
I got the flowers.
They were from you, right?
Oh, yeah.
I just have a minute, and I don't want
to get into a whole thing with you.
This won't take long.
I don't want to fight anymore.
Please, just take the house.
I don't know how else to say this.
What happened yesterday
is gonna happen again.
It's not gonna be the last time
we fight, 'cause that's who we are.
Let's not make it worse by
living on top of each other.
Alex...
I'm gonna tell you something I haven't told
anybody- not orson, not andrew, just you.
I know that I've changed since my business
took off, but I didn't want to admit it.
I've watched myself become
selfish, impatient, rude.
I was never thtype to suffer fools gladly,
but now I seem to find fools everywhere.
And I don't want to be that way.
I need someone who isn't
afraid to speak out,
to call me out when I cross those lines,
and I would love it if
you would be that person.
Did my mother-in-law just give
me permission to criticize her?
Yes, I did.
I'm a lucky guy.
Edie.
Listen, um...
I'm not happy about you lying to me,
but I think what we have is real, A...
I'm not ready to throw it away.
Really?
And don't tell anyone, but
I'm at the point in my life
where I could use a happy ending.
I'll get my stuff.
hello?
Jackson, hi. Do you have a sec?
Sure. Is something wrong?
Uh, no, nothing's wrong. Just...
we need to talk about this move.
At 5:15 that afternoon,
edie williams began calling
her friends to inform them
that her husband had come home.
Sadly, she never got
through to any of them.
gabrielle never picked up.
She was too busy watching her children
being told they had to obey their mother...
and trying not to smile.
Lynette wasn't home when edie called.
she was with her mother, laughing and
sharing stories about the old days...
and enjoying every minute of it.
Bree was outside showing her
future son-in-law color samples
for the home she had bought him...
and smiling politely
when they disagreed.
And susan- well,
she didn't answer
because she was sittinin her
favorite chair with a cup of tea...
learning to enjoy, for
the first time in her life,
what it was like to be alone.
 Eli Scruggs
was the handiest|of all handymen.
You could ask any|of his customers,
and they would tell you,
there was nothing|he couldn't fix.
Whether it was a broken vase...
a leaky pipe...
or a shaky banister,
Eli always knew|how to get the job done.
But sadly,
the man who had fixed|so many things
for the residents|of Wisteria Lane
was now about
to break their hearts.
Eli Scruggs,|get down from there!
Mrs. McCluskey.
Just found this note|in my mailbox.
Says you're retiring?|What the hell?
Yes, ma'am. It's true.
Now why would you want to do|something stupid like that?
My doc says|I got a bum ticker,
have to take it easy|from now on.
Well, once I'm done fixing|Mrs. Mayer's shingles,
I'm on a plane to Waikiki.| Well, this is very annoying.
Who's gonna fix my water heater|when it breaks?
Oh, I met this young guy|named Toby.
Very bright, just turned 30.|He'll take care of you.
Ah, damn it, Eli!
I am not comfortable|with strangers in my house.
Took me ten years to trust you.| I know.
Most of those guys leave tools|and nails all over the place.
You never leave a mess.
Thank you, ma'am.
Have you told everyone else|you're leaving?
I left copies of that same note|in everybody's mailbox.
Well, that's not right.
After all these years, people|will want to say good-bye,
and... you know, maybe throw you|a party or somethin'.
Oh, no. I prefer to go quietly,|if you know what I mean.
I don't want a big fuss.
Well, I'll miss you, Eli.
There will never be|another one like you.
With that Eli Scruggs|climbed his ladder
for the very last time.
And once he had finished|making his last repair,
Eli Scruggs--|quietly, with no fuss--
had a heart attack and died.
And most importantly...
without leaving a mess.
It took an hour|for someone to finally notice
the body laying atop|Susan Mayer's roof.
Aah!
It was|less than ten minutes later
that the neighbors|began arriving,
each determined to get a look
at the various paramedics|and policemen
who were all frantically|trying to figure out
exactly how|to bring the body down.
And it took two days|for my friends to realize
this tragedy|had affected them...
We're ready! Come on.
more than|they were willing to admit.
Hey, Gaby, did you remember|to get change?
'Cause when I cash in my chips,|I don't want to hear you say,
"all I've got is $50s."| Speaking of cashing in your chips,
anyone know when Eli's funeral is?| Oh, I think it's Saturday.
I wonder how many people|are gonna show up.
Mrs. McCluskey was saying|he didn't have much family.
Poor Eli. We should make sure|he's got flowers at his funeral.
I'm in.| How much are we talking?
I don't know.|What do you think, Gaby?
Gaby?
Wow! Jimmy Choo!
Oh, Carlos!
These aren't even|in the states yet.
What's the catch?
What are you talking about?
You never buy me a present
unless I'm mad|or about to be mad.
And I don't think I am,|so why am I about to be?
I have to go to Cleveland tomorrow.| Carlos!
They're begging me.|The merger's going south.
You just got home!
With shoes.
Don't leave me here.|I'm going out of my mind.
Everyone is so boring|and suburban.
And how many|freakin' honor students
can that school have?
Can we please not argue|in front of the handyman?
He has a name.
What's your name?
Eli Scruggs.
You hear that, Carlos?
You've brought me to a place
where people are named|"Eli Scruggs."
Fine.|I'll give up my job...
and everything|that comes with it.
Not the Jimmy Choos.
They're the only friends|I've got.
Thought so.
I'm going to pack.
You know,|it's none of my business...
You're right. It's not.
But the ladies|in this neighborhood
are actually pretty nice.| Yeah. They came by, brought muffins.
One of 'em|wants her basket back.
That'd be Bree.
Anyhow,|she and the other ladies, uh,
play poker every week.
If you'd like,|I could talk to 'em,
see if they'll let you|host a game.
Hi. We're, um...|the neighborhood.
Gabrielle invited us|to play poker.
So... is she in?
Mrs. Solis|will be right down.
She likes to make|an entrance.
What does that mean,|"an entrance"?
Hello there.
Welcome to my home.
Oh.
That's what it means.
So I said, "pumpkin"--
That's what I call|Jon Bon Jovi--
I said, "pumpkin, even if|I could steer a yacht,
I'm certainly not about to do it|in 5-inch heels."
True story.
Well, you've certainly had|quite a glamorous life.
Well, it was before my husband|moved me here to East Nowhere.
Seriously, I don't know|how you girls do it.
Do what?| Get out of bed in the morning.
I've only lived here a month,
and I want|to put a gun to my head.
You know what I mean?
No, we don't.
There are no good|nightclubs, no theater.
What do you do for a good time?
Well, we watch the kids|play soccer.
And the school drama department|puts on some really great shows.
And then there's church,|of course.
Church.
Oh, you're serious.
Look, I know it's quiet here,|but I think you'll find
there's a real charm|to Fairview.
No, no, it's cute. It's cute.|I get that.
It's just...
I was a top-tier fashion model,
and I guess I'm just gonna|have to get used to the fact
that the best part of my life|is behind me.
Good-bye doing vodka shots|with Kate Moss,
and hello
to sipping international coffee|with you girls.
Full house.
Yes?
Hello. Is Mrs. Solis here?
Oh, I got it. I got it.|Go, go, go, go, go.
Ma'am, here's the bill|for fixing your sink.
Okay. Thank you.
By the way...
You made quite an impression|at the poker game.
Really?
Oh, yeah. The ladies|can't stop talking about you.
Aw. Well, I'm sure|it was kind of exciting
for them to have a star|in their midst.
Uh, let me think...|did they say "star"?
I heard, uh, "stuck-up,"|"obnoxious," "bitch."
What?!
You know, I went out on a limb|to get you into that game,
and then you go in there|acting like
you're better than they are.
Oh, my clothes|said that, not me.
Well, did you ask them anything|about their lives?
Why would they want|to talk about their lives?
Their lives are boring.
Well, you know what's|gonna be really boring?
You sitting here alone in this|big house without any friends.
If I were you,|I'd drop the attitude.
Learn to like|your neighbors.
Well,|thanks for the advice.
You wanna add that|to your bill?
No. It's on the house.
I brought muffins.
That's so nice.
We were just...
Playing poker,|and I wasn't invited.
I know. I get it.
I just wanted|to tell you guys
I know I made|a horrible first impression.
Now you know why|models don't usually talk.
Because we say a lot|of stupid, patronizing things.
What I should've said was...|my husband's never home.
I miss the city.
I miss my life.
I'm lonely all the time...
and I could|really use some friends.
Anyway, here.
Now that's how|you make an entrance.
Gaby?
I'm sorry. What?
We're getting a wreath|for Eli's funeral. Are you in?
Actually, why don't you|let me pay for it?
It can still be from all of us.| No, you don't have to do that.
I sort of do.
Now let's play some poker.
All right,|time for my luck to change.
This hand is for Eli.
Hmm. Next hand is for Eli.
You know, if we're gonna|have a get-together
after the funeral, we should|start thinking about food.
And by "we" and "food,"|you mean Bree, right?
I thought that was clear.
I'd be happy to.|Any special requests?
How about we pick something|from your cookbook?
Great. Gaby,|do you have your copy?
I'll go get it.
You use my cookbook|to balance your table?
Oh, it's only temporary.
Juanita needed|her coloring book back.
Oh.| All right.
Watch out, ladies.
I'm sorry if the frittata|is a bit dry.
Are you kidding? It's great.
You should give Linette the recipe.| Yes, 'cause that's what
women in their eighth month|really crave--more stove time.
Mine is so erratic.
I'm not even sure what the|real temperature is.
Of course,|if a certain doctor
would loosen the purse strings...| We're not getting a new stove.
If you would just take on|a few more patients,
we could afford it.
Well, if I'm not supporting|you adequately, my dear,
by all means, feel free|to do something about it.
Such as?
Well, you could maybe...|I don't know, get a job?
I have a job.|I'm a homemaker.
And a damn good one.|So to make this,
you--you just s-saut|some ham and some onions--
It's not happening, Tom.
I just sometimes think
maybe you would appreciate|the value of a dollar more
if you had to work|outside the home.
And I think you would appreciate|my value more if, for once,
you had to cook your own food|and wash your own clothes.
Lynette makes me sew my own buttons.| I'll sew anything you want
if you just stop|getting me pregnant.
I want a new stove, Rex,
and if I need to get a job|to pay for it, so be it.
If you're|looking for a stove,
we've got one|that's hardly ever been used.
I wish I could say the same|for my uterus.
Oh, yeah. I ruined the brunch.
Hey, how's it looking|under there, Eli?
Is it gonna cost me|an arm and a leg?
Nah. A few fingers, maybe.
Honey, my stomach's growling.|When's dinner?
Oh, we're having leftovers.
You can heat them up yourself|if you want.
Since when|do we have leftovers?
Since I started|writing my own cookbook.
Remember how you told me
I should start making|my own money?
Well, I've been going through|all my old recipes,
and I've got|this great idea
for a real home-style American cookbook.| You're not serious?
Why wouldn't I be?
People are always|complimenting me on my cooking.
You're great, but come on.
Every bored housewife|who pulls off a decent lasagna
thinks she can|write a cookbook.
You think I'm just like|every other housewife?
No. No, no, no. That's not what|I'm saying. It's just that...
what do you really know?
I'll learn. And I want it to be|more than just a cookbook.
I want to talk|about traditional values
and give helpful hints|about homemaking.
Look, look,|this is my fault.
You know, I-I was|ribbing you the other day
about getting a job,|but you took it seriously.
If you really want a new stove,|I'll get you a stove.
Now can you stop|this foolishness
and make me something to eat|that isn't leftovers?
Mrs. Van de Kamp?
I fixed your banister.|Should be fine now.
I'll just go.|You can pay me whenever.
I know this is|a rough time for you.
Thanks, Eli.
By the way,
the service for Mr. V.|was really nice.
You were there?
I sat|in the back of the church.
I wanted to say good-bye|to Mr. V.
So uh...
have you thought about|what you're gonna do now?
You mean, with my life?
I don't know.
Mrs. V...
I've been meaning to give this|to you for a while now...
but I, uh,
could never find|the right moment.
I kept it for you, just in case|you might need it someday.
Hope you don't mind.
Oh, I gotta tell you.|I made your Cajun meatloaf.
Whoo!
That may be|my favorite meal ever.
I can't believe|you saved this.
Ah.
Of course,|I'm not really in the mood
to write a cookbook|right now.
Well...
maybe one day you will be.
Hey, Bree, I know what|you can make for the wake--
that flaky-breaded-shrimp|thing.
Thanks, but I know|exactly what I'm gonna make.
Dave, it was a nice trip,|but I gotta tell you,
I don't know why we spent all|that money going to the Bahamas.
If we're not gonna|leave the hotel room,
then why not just cover|ourselves in suntan lotion
and have sex here?
You just got a message|from Mrs. McCluskey.
Oh?
She said your handyman died.
Eli?
Oh, my God.
He was|working on Susan's roof
and dropped dead|of a heart attack.
Can you believe that?
No, no, no. You are not|going to the gym again.
You said we were gonna|have afternoon sex.
We'll do it when I get back.
You say that|every time, Umberto,
And then you're too tired.
Maybe I wouldn't be|if you weren't so clingy.
Clingy?
We haven't had sex|in two weeks.
It's like I'm 15 again.
Not us. You.
Your libido|is out of control.
Umberto--
Look, you've got|a drawerful of toys. Use 'em.
Oh!
Ahem.
Oh!
Oh! Eli! I-I forgot|you were in there.
Yeah. I'm done fixing|your faucet.
Actually, I was done|ten minutes ago,
but I was afraid to come out.| I'm sorry you heard all of that.
The good news is,|while I was in there,
I re-grouted your tub...|free of charge.
Wait a second.
What do you think|of my ass?
Sorry?
My ass--|on a scale from one to ten.
Well, I-I-I, uh...
ticktock.
Ten. It's a ten.
And the boobs?|Perky and firm?
You've named them?
Oh, come on, Eli.
My husband|won't have sex with me.
I just need to make sure|it's not... me.
It's not you.
Are you sure?
Trust me. I used|to work in construction.
My buddies would've|gone crazy for you--
cat calls, uh,|nasty gestures.
"Hey, you,|with the sweater meats!
"If you ever need|any work done, call me!
'Cause I got the perfect tool|for the job!"
Y-you get the drift.
Yeah. I do.
That was insulting|and demeaning.
Oh.
Thank you so much.
Miss Britt?
The door was wide open.
I got the paint. You|want to check the color?
Eh.
Is everything okay?
Things are great.
You want some wine?
We're celebrating.
What's the occasion?
I am no longer married|to a gay guy.
Umberto was gay?
So you wasted your time
installing that light|in the closet,
because...|he went flying out of there.
At least you know now|it wasn't you.
Wasn't it?
He said|that being married to me
was what convinced him|that he liked men.
Oh.
You could imagine what a|boost to the ego that was.
Come on.
You had a gay guy sleeping|with you for two years,
and those guys are pretty hard to land.
No. No, trust me.
No need to be sad.
You're a knockout.
No, I-I-I need|this hand back.
It's hard to be a handyman|without a-a hand.
Mm.
Miss Britt,|what are you doing?
You put the mirror|over my bed.
You know|exactly what I'm doing.
Are you sure about this? I don't|want to take advantage of you.
Oh,|I'm sure you'll be gentle.
Anyway,
I guess they're|burying him on Saturday.
Obviously, you want to go.
Yeah.
I do.
Oh,|leave that black dress out.
I'll get it dry-cleaned|for the funeral.
A little sexy for a funeral,|isn't it?
Oh, I don't think Eli would mind.
Mom?
That's Penny.|I'll be right back.
Mom!
Hey, sweetie.
What's up?
You said you would|help me with my math.
We're dividing fractions.
Oh. I wish you'd caught me|two Chardonnays ago.
Mom, you promised.
I know, but mommy's|still planning Eli's memorial.
Start without me.
I'll be there|in a little while.
Oh, my gosh.|Lynette, are you okay?
The doctor just called.|I'm pregnant.
This is fantastic!
You--
Yeah. Whoop-dee-doo.
Honey, you don't sound|too happy about this.
I was planning|to go back to work.
What? What a--|what are you talking about?
I had it in the back|of my mind for a while,
and then yesterday, I got a ph--| Hold it.
Sorry. I was having trouble|paying attention.
Jeffrey Cuevas is retiring|in September.
I am the perfect person|to step into his job,
and that is exactly when|Parker starts kindergarten.
The timing is like a dream.
But what about our dream|of having a-a little girl?
This could be our chance.
Oh, please. You know it's gonna|be a boy. It's always a boy.
It's just gonna pee|in my face
and hide dead things|in my shoes.
I am doing this, Tom.
I am going after this job.
But who's gonna take care of the kids?
Well, I was hoping you could|cut back on your hours at work.
I can't do that.
I have a career.
You did not just say that.
No, I-I didn't. I didn't.
Tom, I cannot just|stay at home wiping noses.
I need it for my sanity,
and I need you|to back me up.
Oh!
Mom?
Well, the kids are up.
They're gonna want|their breakfast.
And I'm gonna back you up|by, uh, making it for 'em.
My hero.
Jeff Cuevas is fantastic,
but I know I could take his|department to a whole new level.
What the hell is that?
Oh, my water broke.
Take the overnight bag|out to the car.
Oh, three weeks.
That's a little soon, but, uh,|sure, I could make that work.
For God sakes, Lynette,|we gotta go to the hospital.
In a minute. I'm|trying to lock this job down.
What kind of|perks are we talking about here?
Okay, you're having|contractions. That's it. You--
I swear,|if you touch this phone,
I will have this baby right here|and then beat you with it!
You're insane.|We have to go.
Could you hold on|one second?
We agreed|I could go back to work
after I gave birth.| After, Lynette, not during!
I'm sorry.
Is there any way we could finish|this conversation tomorrow?
Oh!
L-l-later in the day|works better for me, too.
Well, thank you very much.
Bye.| Hey. Whew! I got the job.
Congratulations.|The baby's arm is sticking out.
Why don't you high-five it?
Tom, I am in pain.|Do you mind?
Oh.
You'll see, Tom.
I know.|People say that you... ooh!
You can't have it all,|but I know we can.
Oh, Mr. Swenson, I can't|tell you how excited I am.
Maybe you could schedule|a staff meeting
so I could hit the ground|running on Monday.
No, no.
No, it can't be Friday,
because, remember, we agreed|that we would start next week?
So again, thank you so much|for this opportunity.
Mrs. Scavo?|Yeah?
I think you might have|forgotten somethin'.
Could you hold on a second?
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
She's fine.
I was on the phone.
I was talking to my new boss, and I...| She was only in there for a minute.
But it's 85 degrees outside.|I've never done this before.
You got a lot on your mind--|three kids and a newborn,
it sounds like new job.
Yeah, I do.
Yeah. It's a lot to handle.
There you go.
Mm.
I should probably get back|to Susan's windows.
Uh, you take care.
Lynette,|are you still there?
Lynette?
Hello?
Are you still there?
Hey. You coming back in?
No.
I'm gonna go help my daughter|with her homework.
Ugh.
Yard sale!
Oh! Good. You're here.
How are you, Eli?
Fine. You?
Great. Yeah, I haven't worn|these Jeans in a while,
and I found 20 bucks|in the pocket.
Don't you just love|when that happens?
Also, Karl left me|for his secretary,
so I need you|to change these locks.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
Oh, thanks, but don't be.|Just hurry.
Karl said he was coming by|to get some of his stuff,
and I want this place|to be a fortress by then.
You're doing all right,|though?
Oh, well, on one hand,
I got dumped for a pair|of headlights named Brandy.
On the other, I reported|Karl's credit cards stolen,
and I cut the pockets|out of all of his pants.
So a little from column "a,"|a little from column "b."
Oh. Sorry.
Well, if it's any consolation,|redheads are nuts.
What do you mean?
That she'll make his life|a living hell.
It sounds like|what he deserves.
Brandy's not a redhead.|She's blonde.
So, uh, you maybe want to go|with a dead bolt this time?
What... do... you... know
I saw him around town|a couple times with a redhead.
Uh, people in the neighborhood|were talking.
I-I thought you knew.
I didn't.
Would you feel any better
knowing that, uh,|she's kinda chubby?
Just leave!
But what--|but what about the locks?
I-i-if Karl's coming...
Change the locks, then leave.
Okay,|but I really am sorry--
Change the locks,|don't talk to me, then leave.
Susan?
Susan, did you call me?
I couldn't really understand|the message.
Oh, wow.
You want me|to come back later?
Are you all right?
No. Of course you're not.
I heard you and Mike|are getting divorced.
I'm sorry.
Probably not|what you want to hear,
but I thought|you were a great couple.
Thanks.
Sweet.
Do you--maybe you remember|what you wanted me to do?
Locks.
Change the locks. Got it.
Let me go see what I got|out in the truck.
Susan...
I don't know much|about love.
I... I dabbled in it|once or twice,
but it always seemed|more trouble than it was worth.
I told myself|I wasn't missing much.
But watching you|all these years,
how...|how hard you've tried, how...
how hurt you've been,
but you still...
keep getting back up,|you dust yourself off,
then you try again.
Maybe I am...
missing something.
Maybe...
maybe it is worth it.
And, um, I'm sure|it's not gonna help
for you to hear|tell you this,
but you're damn heroic|to me.
You are.
Yeah.
Hey. Just dropping these off.|I finally got 'em cut.
Tell Jackson|I'm sorry it took me so long.
Actually, um...
Jackson and I split up.
Wow. I'm sorry.
Am I sorry?
Oh, yeah.
He's a great guy.
I just, uh,
want to be alone right now.
Well, good for you.
Oh, hey.| Mm?
As long as you're here,
I think there's a loose shingle|on my roof.
Do you think maybe|you could fix it for me?
Oh, I'd be happy to.
But just so you know,
it'll be the last thing I ever|fix for you. I'm retiring.
What?
Today's my last day.
You can't retire.|I break too many things.
I know. You paid for the trip|to Hawaii I'm gonna take.
No, it's the right move.|Be happy for me.
Hey, I am happy for you.
It's just, uh...
this is gonna sound crazy.
What?
Um, I think you have been
the most consistent|male relationship in my life.
You're so stable and reliable,|and I just...
always thought|you'd be around.
Which is funny, because I don't|really know anything about you.
Well, how about this--|I fix your shingle,
and when I'm done, you can|ask me anything you want.
Great.
I will go to the store right now|and get some wine
so we can toast|your retirement.
I like that. Perfect way|to end my time on Wisteria Lane.
Oh, yes.
What kind do you like--|red or white?
Either one. Just make sure|it's a screw top.
Eli Scruggs was buried|on a Saturday...
and all the people that Eli|had helped over the years
came to pay|their last respects.
But one person was missing--
someone who had changed|Eli's life...
in a way he never forgot.
Hope I'm not interrupting|your day.
Not at all. Can I help you?
I was hoping I could help you.|I'm a handyman.
Just moved into town.|Looking for work.
Sorry. I, um, I don't have|anything that needs fixing.
Well, if you ever do,|uh, here's my card.
"Eli Scruggs."
What a distinctive name.
People do seem to remember it.
So if any of your friends,|uh, need help,
I can do pretty much anything.| I don't know. Um...
If you have a extra card or two,|I-I could hand them out.
Oh,|I'd really appreciate that.
Oh.|Oh.
Anyway...
thank you for your time.
I have a broken vase.
I'm sorry?
I-I was, uh,|dusting the other day
and knocked it off the bureau,|like an idiot.
Anyway, I saved the pieces.
If you could glue it|back together for me,
I'd really appreciate it.
Oh, ma'am,|you don't have to do that.
Mr. Scruggs,
I need my vase fixed.
It means a lot to me.
Now you're not gonna|make me beg, are you?
No, ma'am, I'm not.
Good.
Come on in.
Mr. Young?
Oh. Didn't mean to disturb you.
Your front door was wide open.
Oh.
Eli, I-I don't have any work|for you today.
I'm just here to drop off|that handle you wanted.
Finally found one that matched.|Want me to install it?
Not today.
Okay.
I'll just be going then.
Eli, wait.
What?
Do you remember this?
Oh, right.
This is the very first|thing you ever fixed for me.
Yeah, that must have been what,|uh, two years ago?
Yeah.
I just that glue really held, huh?| Yeah.
I want you to have it.
What?
Why?
I've just been|doing some thinking
about the people I know,
the ones who've walked|into my life
and made it better than it was before...| Oh.
People like you.| Oh.
Anyway, I've--I've--|I've never said "thank you."
Oh, no, I'm--I'm the one|who should thank you.
You--you introduced me|to all your friends.
My business|couldn't be better.
I'm so glad.
Yeah.
Anyway, I, uh,|I want you to have this.
Mrs. Young...
Are you all right?
Everything's fine.
Are you sure?
You should go now.
So I look in the window,
and there's blood everywhere--
all over the walls and the ceiling...| Oh!
Not to mention,|her hardwood floors,
which she just had installed|last week.
I don't know|what she was thinking.
I just wish there had been|some warning,
some sign that she would do|such a thing.
Eli Scruggs sat in his truck|for almost an hour,
devastated that he had done|nothing to save me.
He then made a quiet vow|to God--
From that moment forward,
he would do what he could|to help people,
to help them fix their lives.
And for the rest of his life,
that's exactly what he did.
That was a lovely service.
Eli would've liked it.
Hell of a turnout.| Who knew he had so many friends?
I'm not surprised.|He was a good man.
I can't help feeling
there's more we could have done|to honor him.
Well, let's just make sure|we remember him.
Eli would have said that's more|than most people get.
And he would have|been right...
As usual.
Wait.
I wanted to fix something|for Eli for a change.
And somewhere,
in a place reserved|for the very best of us,
Eli Scruggs smiled|and said, "thank you."

Previously on...
Porter Scavo,
you are under arrest.
What?! Porter had nothing
to do with that fire.
Apparently there is a
witness that says otherwise.
A witness? What are
they talking about?
Porter was accused but not convicted.
Katherine's love affair...
I got the flowers.
became serious.
Mommy needs to lose a few pounds.
You wanna help mommy be beautiful again?
No.
As did Gaby's resolve.
Here's my cookbook.
And Bree's success came at a price.
You can be a little tough sometimes.
It's only to be expected.
I don't think I do that.
I know you don't.
People don't talk about money
in the suburbs...
Mostly because they don't need to.
The ones who have it
let you know with their
brand-new clothes...
their expensive appliances...
Those are good.
And their manicured lawns.
The ones who don'thave it
let you know with barbecues
that need replacing...
Walls that need painting...
And classic cars...
that need to be sold.
Hey you go, Walter. She's all yours.
This is so awesome!
Where's Tom? I wanna thank him
for making this the greatest day of my life.
He's inside,
but between sobs,
he wished you happy driving.
Where is that man
going with Tom's car?
Oh, that man is Walter
Brotski, and he just bought it.
Tom loves that car.
Why would you sell it?
Sadly, we can no longer
afford Tom's midlife crisis.
Okay, here's the deal. We're...
sort of broke.
Oh.
Lynette.
Between Porter's legal fees
and that ghost town that
we call a restaurant...
I thought Scavo's was doing well.
When times get tough,
People do without things
like pizza and sports cars.
I am so sorry. I had no idea.
It's okay.
Just keep it under your hat.
It's a little embarrassing.
You should not be embarrassed.
This is a horrible economy.
We're all in the same boat.
Mm.
Hello, ladies. What do you think?
You bought a new car?
My book just made the
"Times" best seller list.
Now they're talking 3-book deal,
so I got the urge to splurge.
Oh!
And look what just blew on my
windshield at the stop sign!
Ah!
Life is good.
Yes, people don't talk
about money in the suburbs
because when they do,
other people get angry.
Whenever someone on Wisteria Lane
buys a new car,
a simple ritual is performed.
So how do you like my new car?
It's gorgeous!
I am so jealous.
I wish I had one.
But on this day,
One of the owner's friends
refused to participate in the ritual.
And even more surprisingly,
the owner of the car in question
didn't seem to notice.
Look, there's even a refrigerator.
The Lexus dealer said
there's just enough room
for a split of champagne
and two chilled glasses.
Ooh.
Ahh.
Mmm!
And the best thing is, it's a hybrid
so you can barely hear it.
Let me show you.
Actually, I have to go to work.
But congratulations,
Bree. It's a beauty.
Was it just me, or was
that a little abrupt?
Eh, don't take it personally.
I think she's got other
things on her mind.
Oh, dear. Is something wrong?
Well...
apparently, she and Tom are
having financial problems.
They just had to sell Tom's car.
And you know, I saw her
at the recycling center.
She was turning her
cans in for money.
Ohh. Yikes.
That's, like, a half a step away
from selling your
eggs on the internet.
And here I am, rubbing my
fabulous new car in her face.
I feel awful.
Oh, don't.
How could you have known?
Thank god I didn't show her
how the car parks itself.
But you're gonna show us, right?
Well, it is pretty amazing!
Well, it's nice to see
you again, Mrs. Mayer.
Thank you for agreeing
to see us, Mr. Hobson.
Running a school like Oakridge
mustn't leave you with much...
Free time.
Happy to oblige.
So I heard through the grapevine
that there might be an
opening for another student?
I assume you're referring to
the Henderson boy's expulsion?
Yeah. He bit his teacher, huh?
They had that problem
with their older boy, Toby.
It's a family of biters.
Well, the whole situation
was incredibly unfortunate.
But...
Mm.
We can't tolerate
that kind of behavior.
Well, you wouldn't have to
worry about that with M.J.
He's so well-behaved.
Look, I know how much you
want your son at Oakridge.
You've called us every week
for the past five months.
I've been too pushy. Oh,
please don't take it out on M.J.
He is such a bright kid.
Say something in Spanish.
I'm bored.
Be bored in Spanish.
Mrs. Mayer, you can relax.
We would love to have
M.J. Join us here.
Seriously?
Yes.
As a matter of fact, his name
was first on our waiting list.
Fantastic!
Oh!
Here's a schedule for you.
Here are some insurance
forms you need to fill out.
And here's the tuition.
As you can see, it's gone up a tad.
Oh.
Yeah. That's quite a tad.
But we're starting in
the middle of the year,
so we'd only pay half, right?
Yes. We've already
prorated it. That is half.
Fantastic.
Hey, I just thought of a way
for us to celebrate our
anniversary next week.
What do you think about
dinner at the Palm?
The Palm?
As in,
"they don't even show the
prices on the menu" the Palm?
Honey, we're still paying
off credit card debt.
Not anymore. The deal
closed. I got the bonus.
Oh, my God!
That's great!
Oh, why didn't you tell me this
when you were begging
for sex this morning?
You would've closed
that deal, too. Oh!
Oh. We're rich again! Hallelujah!
Well, we are not"lighting
cigars with $5 bills" rich,
but we are headed in
the right direction.
Oh!
Honey, we're gonna be us again...
The old Carlos and Gaby.
You know what?
I'm gonna wear my dress
from the night you proposed.
You still fit in that?
We're rich again! Hallelujah!
Have you not noticed
me working my butt off?
I'm almost back to the weight
I was when we got married!
All I meant was...
You don't have to wear an old dress.
I will buy you a new one.
No, no.
This'll be way more romantic.
I'm one good colonic away
from being the old me!
I'll call the restaurant.
They can write that on the cake.
Sorry. I know how much
you loved that car.
This is all I have
to remember her by.
I called her "Foxy."
You wanna know why?
No.
Tom.
I just heard. You sold the car?
Yeah.
Well, we needed the money.
The restaurant is dying.
Apparently, people don't
wanna buy their pizza
from parents of an alleged arsonist.
Yeah, but Porter didn't do it.
Well, maybe people still
think that he's guilty,
or maybe it's the economy.
Or maybe it's both. I don't know.
All I know is, I am
driving a "dad car"
while some other guy is
out rolling with Foxy.
Oh, buddy. I'm so sorry.
I wish there was
something I could do.
We should get going.
But if we can help in
any way, um, let us know.
Okay?
Thanks.
Okay, what just happened back there?
Nothing.
Oh, yeah. Like that's gonna work.
Why can't you ever remember
who you're dealing with?
Bob? Bob? Bob? Bob...
I can keep this up all day.
Bob? B...
Fine.
The day the case against
Porter was dismissed,
I was going over the discovery
materials that the DA sent me.
Okay? So?
The witness who put Porter in
the storage room at the club,
the only one linking him
directly to the arson...
Tom's helpful buddy
there... Dave Williams.
What?
Yeah.
Porter wasn't even in the building.
What the hell is Dave doing?
I don't know, but we have
to tell Tom and Lynette.
No, that'll just get ugly.
I'm okay with that.
Lee, the charges have been dropped.
It's no longer our business.
Besides, there's something
about that Dave guy
that scares me.
Oh!
Oh, I don't get it!
I'm only a few pounds
away from my runway weight.
You want me to let it out?
That would be cheating.
I'm gonna try to go pee again.
It's okay.
You've had two children.
The weight redistributes.
Give in to it! I did.
Jean, you didn't just give in to it.
You slapped a piece of cheese on it.
Yeah, I said it.
Now just fix the hem.
And this time, try not
to leave the edges frayed.
Ooh! Ooh!
Hey, Edie! Wait up!
Now don't forget,
the clasp is broken.
Oh, I'll replace it.
It may not match exactly.
But, um, your hair will cover it.
Jean, Carlos is taking me to
the Palm, not out for hoagies.
Make it perfect.
Huh. I see Jean is back.
Ah, yeah.
Times are good.
Not for her.
Hey, Mrs. Mccluskey said something
about you losing 5 pounds in one day.
How'd you do that?
I got drunk on Bourbon and
threw up all over her lawn.
No, not that story.
Something about a boot camp.
Oh, yeah. Just started.
Very military, very intense.
That's perfect. I'm trying
to fit in an old dress.
I need intense.
Forget it. You can't get
in without a recommendation,
and I'm not recommending you.
Why not?
Because you'd embarrass me.
This is real exercise.
It's not the lotus position
followed by a Mocha latte.
Oh, you're just afraid I'm
gonna look better than you!
6:00 AM, the park.
Prepare to die.
Jeez. This is the tuition?
We're gonna blow his
college fund on first grade.
I know, I know. We may have
to give up a few luxuries.
Yeah, like food and heat.
Okay, you know the problems
they're having at his school.
And now with all the
budget cutbacks...
I mean, this place is fabulous.
Yeah, I'm not saying it's not.
I'd kill to send him there.
But I just can't swing it.
Well, we've gotta do something.
My editor just quit,
and my books are not exactly
flying off the shelves.
Could you pick up some extra shifts?
Oh, yeah, I will...
as soon as they
create a 30-hour day.
I'm working around the clock.
What about that big job you
just did for the last three months?
What did you do with that money?
Susan, we're not married anymore.
And what I do with my money
is none of your business.
Yeah, well, if we were
still married, you'd...
Probably would've waited
until I finished my sentence.
What's this?
A check.
I understand you and Tom are
going through some rough times.
No. Oh!
Thank you, but I can't accept this.
However, I would like to know
how much I'm not accepting.
$20,000?!
How many cookbooks are you selling, woman?
We just went to a second printing,
And now they're
talking a 3-book deal.
So seriously, I am not
gonna miss that money.
Wow!
That must be nice.
But... I can't accept it.
Why not?
What's the point of success
If you can't share it
with the people you love?
Because the people that you love
may not be able to pay you back,
and then you stop loving them.
Then it's not a loan, it's a gift.
Don't you have a birthday coming up?
And so do you.
And I'm gonna feel real crappy
when you unwrap your
lavender bath beads.
Come on, Lynette.
You can't tell me this money
won't take the pressure off.
It would.
But I can't. I wouldn't want
it to affect our friendship.
Okay.
Although...
How would you like to own
a piece of an Italian restaurant?
What?
It wouldn't be a loan or a gift.
It would be... an investment
That would buy you,
say... 15% of Scavo's.
Oh! Well, that's an intriguing offer.
If we do well, you get
a cut of the profits.
If we go belly-up, we liquidate,
and you get the first $20,000.
And then, of course, my
family moves in with you.
So... Do we have a deal?
We most certainly do...
Partner.
Some people think it's strange
I have a contract
for my exercise class.
But I want people to understand
the commitment I expect from them.
I found in the past...
Here you go.
All signed.
You didn't even read it.
Oh, no need. I'm up for anything.
Although I did just get a manicure,
so nothing that might chip a nail.
Mrs. Solis...
Let me tell you what I
learn in the Israeli army.
A group without commitment
is a group that will fail.
The women in my morning
class are committed.
I am starting to think
that you are not tough enough.
Not tough enough?
Let me tell you something,
Mr. Iraqi army guy.
Israeli.
Whatever.
I used to be a model, and
you don't know what war is
until you've been in a dressing room
with a bunch of size zeroes
reaching for the last rice cake.
I am plenty tough.
I'm not so sure.
Hey, I know some of those
women in your exercise class.
The most exercise they ever
get is cutting a piece of cake.
That's a lap!
Excuse me?
In the contract.
There are certain words
I do not tolerate...
"cake," "tired,"
"can't," "doughnut."
If I hear them, you owe me a lap.
It's an exercise class.
Why would anyone say "doughnut"?
That's another lap!
You know, maybe I should
give this a little gander.
Come on, ladies!
When I was in the special forces,
we would do sit-ups
in 115-degree weather.
I still have sand in my ass.
You people are weak!
Let's go! Let's go!
Gaby, knock it off.
You're gonna get us all in trouble.
It's hard.
Of course it is. That's
why it's called boot camp.
Just hang in there, Gaby.
We all went through it.
Shut up, Mona. I'm puking air.
He's coming. Get crunching.
Hey! Did I hear talking?
Sorry, sir! She got
a little nauseous.
I don't give a rat's
ass what your problem is.
You retch on your own time.
Okay. We need to talk.
Gaby, no.
What the hell are you doing?
Get your butt back down!
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Time-out. Time-out?
Look, I appreciate this
whole military commando act,
but I'm new at this, and
frankly, this is a bit much.
A bit much?
Yeah.
Are we gonna get a break soon?
Oh. Oh, we want a break.
Like, maybe some coffee,
some pastry?
Oh, that sounds so yummy.
You got any?
No, I don't got any!
Now getdown or I'm gonna put you down!
I said time-out!
There is no time -out!
You signed a contract! Now get down!
Don't take that tone with me.
I am paying.
Do it! Do it!
Aah!
Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it!
Who brought her here?
That would be me!
Sorry, sir!
Because of Edie,
our 2-mile run is now 4 Miles!
Oh, my God. Look at those. Wow!
Hey. What's going on?
Oh, Susan, you gotta check these out.
Oh, please don't make a fuss.
They're magnicent.
Susan, look at 'em.
Uh, what am I looking at exactly?
The pearls.
Oh, those. Oh, they're stunning.
Oh.
Thank you.
Well, I have a big bar mitzvah
to prep. See ya.
Oh. Mm. She's so lucky.
Mike is such a great guy
What? Mike bought those?
He bought her pearls?
He's a keeper.
Oh, that's right.
You didn't keep him, did you?
Mm.
Su...
Hi.
Lynette, hi. Oh, I wish
I had time for a chat,
but I'm on my way
to a meeting.
I might design my own line
of bakeware. Can you imagine?
This will just take a sec.
Okay.
Tom and I are so grateful
for your investment
that we want to do
something special for you.
Oh, that sounds lovely.
We'd like to shut Scavo's down
for the night
and throw a party in your honor.
Just family and friends.
We'd toast your success
and have a night of fun,
Just like old times.
What do you say?
Oh, that sounds nice.
Can we walk and talk?
Yeah, yeah.
You know what might be even better?
My publisher has been begging me
to do a local launch for my book.
Hmm.
I could do a signing at your restaurant
and finally fill the place.
Would you hold that for a moment?
Oh. Well, we've filled the place
many times, but it's your party.
Whatever you want.
Oh, you can just put that
on a hanger in the back.
What I want is to make this
an opportunity for you.
We can turn one of your
dismal Thursday night seatings
into a real event.
I don't know what to say.
Well, don't thank me.
It was your idea.
Right.
Glad I thought of it.
Susan Mayer knew she couldn't
always give her son
everything she would've liked...
Yet when she saw
her child's tuition
around Katherine Mayfair's neck,
she felt something
had been stolen from him.
And it didn't take her long to decide...
how she was going to get it back.
Susan, hi.
Hi. You at home?
Uh, yeah. I'm just about to jump
in the shower. What's up?
I'm going crazy 'cause I think
I left my front door unlocked.
Could you run and check?
I'll stay on the line.
No, no. I totally understand.
The one day I don't lock up
I always think that's the day
somebody's gonna break in.
Exactly.
And so even though I was already
halfway to the airport,
I turned around and I came home,
and, yep, I had left
the garbage disposal on.
So ever since then, I always check.
Oh, I'm the same way.
Anyway, you can relax.
The front door's all locked up.
Oh, you know what?
I'm actually still worried
about the side door.
Do you think you could check that, too?
Already did. You're good.
Well, I'm gonna take that shower now.
See ya later, hon.
Mike, is that you?
You're just in time.
Susan?
Hi.
Hey!
Susan Mayer!
For god sake,
give me back my pearls!
Pearls or towel--
you decide.
You wouldn't dare.
I have been naked on this street.
It would be nice to take the heat off that story.
Have you lost your mind?
Mike said he can't afford to
pay for M.J.'s private school.
Now I know why.
He wants to see his
girlfriend wearing pearls
when she flashes him.
What? He wouldn't
pay for M.J.'s school?
No. So I was going to take these
and sell them to try to pay for it,
and, yes, now that
I'm saying it out loud,
I hear how stupid that sounds.
I can't believe Mike would do that.
Well, he did.
Hey, Mrs. Mayfair.
It's nice to see you.
Perhaps we should discuss this later.
This can't be good.
So is this a "welcome home,
we missed you" kind of thing
Or...
Oh.
Damn right, "oh." what
happened to "I'm broke
and can't afford to send M.J. To private school"?
Don't get me wrong, Mike.
It was a wonderfully
generous present.
But you can't go around
blowing your kid's money
on jewelry for your girlfriend.
What did these cost you?
$4,000, $5,000?
$129.
What?
They're fake, okay?
And I knew how badly
you wanted pearls,
and I couldn't afford real ones.
And the salesman swore you'd
never know the difference,
and she didn't.
Well...
at least you won't feel
bad if you ever lose them.
I just wanted to get
you a really nice gift,
and I don't know.
I... I guess I was
embarrassed when I couldn't.
Mike, don't ever feel
like you have to spend
money to impress me.
Okay?
Trust me.
I'm already very impressed.
Ugh. Okay, okay. Point made.
Move along.
I'll go fix us some dinner.
How dare you.
I didn't know they were fake.
I mean how dare you think
that I would put
jewelry for my girlfriend
ahead of my son's education.
Okay, maybe I jumped to conclusions,
but this school is important for M.J.
I feel really bad that
we're falling short.
Susan, I've been at work
since 6:00 this morning,
and after I inhale
a 5-minute dinner,
I'm going back out till midnight.
I am busting my ass to
give our son the best,
so if we're falling short,
it's not because of me.
What?
Where are you? You're
late for training.
Oh, yeah, I quit that.
There is no quitting.
It's in the contract.
Yeah, well, maybe you should
take it up with my lawyer.
Here he is.
We are not leaving!
Oh.
Come on, ladies! Keep going!
Keep it moving!
What the hell do you
think you're doing?
When you don't come to boot camp,
Boot camp comes to you. Fall in!
Are you out of mind?
I have two sleeping children.
Oh, I know. I've
seen the cellulite.
Fall in!
Do it, Gaby. There is no quitting.
Oh, don't get all
holier than thou, Mona.
I saw you pull into the
doughnut shack yesterday.
Doughnut... that's a lap!
Oh, really? Well,
try this on for size.
I'm going back to
bed, because I'm tired.
And when I wake up,
maybe I'll have some cake,
and you can't stop me.
Gaby!
Where are you going?
If you don't get out there,
he is gonna take it
out on the rest of us.
Well, frankly, some of them need it.
I just came for a little remodel,
and there are some real
teardowns out there.
Wow. You are one spoiled,
selfish, little brat.
Oh, for god sakes, Edie,
it's a stupid exercise class.
I tried it. It sucked.
I don't want to do it anymore.
Lighten up.
Well, that stupid little exercise class is filled
with women who bust their
asses three times a week
while raising kids and
holding down full-time jobs.
Well, they're crazy.
He yells, and they jump.
He tells them to run all the
way over here, and they do it.
He didn't make us come here.
We agreed to.
What the hell for?
Because you told us
that it was important to
you to get into that dress.
So we came here to support you.
You wanted the old Gaby back?
Well, congratulations. You got her...
A self-centered, obnoxious jerk.
Personally, I liked
poor, paunchy Gaby better.
At least she had some humility.
Okay, time to stretch.
Not you!
You are 25 minutes late. Give me 50.
Oh, my god. You're her!
Well, technically, I'm she, but yes.
Your turkey tetrazzini
saved my marriage.
Would you sign this for me?
Certainly.
I am so excited to be
tasting your food tonight.
My food?
What are you talking about?
Oh, well, it says here
the chefs of Scavo's
Are going to be making recipes from your book.
They are?
I can't wait to try
that four cheese pizza.
Well, you might have to.
Excuse me.
Lynette.
I understand you
and your fellow chefs
will be serving my four
cheese pizza tonight.
Yep.
Just adding the parmesan.
But that's commercial parmesan.
So?
So that's like the dust
they sweep off the floor
of a place that makes real cheese.
Oh, no. It's fine.
We use it all the time.
Oh, perhaps you do, but my
recipe specifies fresh grated.
Bree, no one will notice.
Parmesan is the fourth
cheese in a four cheese pizza.
It's the Ringo of these cheeses.
Hey, Mr. Scavo said the grease
trap is overflowing again.
Oh, for pete's sake.
I'll be right back.
Uh, take your time.
I'm sorry. We haven't
been introduced.
I'm Bree Hodge, part owner.
Hi. I'm Cindy.
We'll chat later.
Roll out some dough and
show me where the basil is.
We'll be serving three
cheese pizza tonight.
But what about the
pizzas that we just made?
Tom, I can't tell you
how happy I am for you.
This place is packed. It's packed!
Yep. You know what?
Bree really came through for us.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Even if she hadn't,
you would have landed on your feet.
I had total faith in you.
And you have had three scotch and sodas.
Dude, this money goes
right in your pocket.
Mm! I'm just supporting you.
Hey, I gotta go check
on that grease trap.
Yeah, I gotta get back to Edie.
She wanted me home by 10:00.
But, dude, congratulations.
I'm proud of you.
See ya.
You bet.
Hey, Tom?
Yeah?
Nothing. Never mind.
You're busy. You know, wait.
I...
I just want you to know that...
That guy's not your friend.
Who? Dave?
Is there someplace we can talk?
Yeah.
Son of a...
If this doesn't stop
your mother-in-law
from criticizing your cooking,
I will give you a full refund.
Hey, can I borrow you a sec?
Now? People are waiting.
You'll still be a celebrity
in five minutes. Come on.
Excuse me.
You want to explain this?
Oh, dear. I was hoping
to spare your feelings,
but since you know, I wasn't
comfortable having my recipe
made with substandard ingredients.
We use that parmesan all the time.
You can't go changing
things without asking me.
Hey, you made me partner.
I can change 15%, and
I chose the parmesan.
And I don't know if you've heard,
but people are raving about my pizza.
Well, they probably would
have loved my pizza, too,
but we'll never know,
because my partner threw it
in the garbage. What a waste.
Fine. I'll reimburse you,
if that'll make things right.
Oh, sure. It's only money, right?
What's that supposed to mean?
We all know how well
you're doing, Bree.
You have made that very clear.
But you shouldn't be
lording it over everybody
just 'cause you've
caught a couple of breaks.
Caught a couple of breaks?
I've worked my ass
off to get where I am.
I've worked my ass off, too.
I just wasn't as lucky as you.
Well, I've always believed
that we create our own luck.
Meaning that I've
created my own failure?
Well, not completely, but let's
face it. You do cut corners.
I mean, one of the
things I can teach you
is the importance of the attention to detail.
Wow. Talk about luck.
When I offered to throw you
this little thank-you party,
I never imagined that it
would turn into an opportunity
for me to learn from
the great Bree Hodge.
Well, I'm not the
one who needed $20,000
to keep my business afloat.
No, you're the one who's
never gonna let me forget it.
Where are you going?
Home. Tell me how the party
I threw for you turns out.
Lynette, I... I... I don't
understand why you're so upset.
I know you don't,
but five years ago, you would've.
My car!
You know that was an accident, right?
I did the best I could
on the clasp, Mrs. Solis.
I don't think you'll be
able to tell the difference.
Okay, be honest.
Here I come.
So what do you think?
You are stunning.
Radiant.
Really?
Really.
You're back, Mrs. Solis,
exactly like you were before.
Oh, I think I've
changed a little bit.
Not that I can see.
If there's nothing
else, I'll be going.
Jean, wait.
What is it? Is there a problem?
No, no. It's perfect.
I just want to tell you
how helpful you've been
to me over the years,
and I'm really grateful.
Thank you.
Hey, buddy. How was
the rest of the...
Oh!
I know what you did.
What?!
Don't give me that!
I know that you told the cops
that Porter set that fire.
I didn't say he set the fire.
I only said I saw him
in the back hallway.
You couldn't have!
He wasn't there!
Tom, the cops were
really grilling me.
They wouldn't let up.
I had to tell them
what I thought I saw.
Porter could have gone to jail.
You almost destroyed my
family, destroyed our business.
I'll make it up to you. I swear.
I never meant to hurt you or Lynette.
Oh, Lynette doesn't know
about this. I didn't tell her.
If I had, you'd be dead.
I am so sorry.
I never should have said
anything to the cops.
It was dark. I'd been drinking.
You've gotta believe me.
Stop.
Just stop.
Are you done?
Yeah.
This is crazy.
I mean, there's gotta be
some way we can work this out.
We're friends.
That's what I thought, too.
But I don't know who you are.
Tom.
Tom.
Can I ask you something?
Go ahead. Shoot.
I've been thinking a lot
about your first wife.
Edie.
I know. Just one question,
and then I'll shut it.
I don't like talking about her.
It has been weeks since I
found out she even existed,
and I've never mentioned her once.
Come on. Look at this as my reward.
Okay.
One question.
Being married to her...
-Mm-hmm.
Or being married to me...
Mm.
What's the biggest difference?
Honestly?
Our marriage is more real.
Really?
Mm.
In what way?
Well,with her, it was like...
a fairy tale.
I thought it would last forever.
It didn't.
What you and I have is more real
because I know it's not forever.
When I hold you,
when I kiss you,
I try to remind myself
to appreciate the moment,
because tomorrow may never come.
Love...
is just temporary.
The way the fairy tale ends...
is death.
My first instinct
was to ask you if she
was prettier than me.
When will I learn to go with my gut?
I'm sorry. You can't
afford the tuition?
No.
But I read in your brochure
that faculty members
get a 50% discount,
so for your Art Department,
how would you like to hire
an award-winning
children's book illustrator
who is great with kids and
has a face you can't say no to?
Unfortunately,
our Art Department is fully staffed.
Can't say no.
Miss Mayer,
I appreciate your enthusiasm
and the face,
but I'm afraid it
just won't work out.
I wish you the best of luck.
Yes.
Right.
No, wrong.
Miss Mayer, please, I'm so busy.
Look, I know I said that
M.J. was a star student,
but the truth is,
he's one of those kids
that needs extra attention.
The classes at his
school are way too big,
and I see him getting
lost in the shuffle.
And if he gets lost now...
my ex-husband is doing
everything that he can,
and I need to know that I am, too.
I will serve lunches.
I will be a janitor.
Anything.
But I am not walking
out on my son's future.
Well, one of our art teachers
does need an assistant,
but you're completely overqualified.
I'll take it.
Congratulations on your new job.
Congratulations.
on getting me out of your office.
What's that?
A check for the damage to your car.
I can't afford to go
through my insurance company.
Oh, Lynette, don't be silly.
It's just the bumper.
You don't need to do that.
Yes, I do.
And the minute we're
back on our feet,
I am gonna pay back
your investment...
Every penny,
with interest.
Lynette, stop. Wait.
Please. Don't be this way.
I don't want money to get
in the way of our friendship.
Yeah...
I think it's a little late for that.
There's a lot you can do
with money in the suburbs.
You can pay for a night on the town.
You can provide a
private school education.
You can purchase a
token of affection.
But the one thing you
must never do with money
is use it as a weapon,
because someone...
always gets hurt.

He's in your band.
This is too dangerous.
There were victims
of both violence
and hard times.
We're sort of broke.
I thought Scavo's was doing well.
When times get tough,
people do without things
like pizza.
And beneficiaries...
The deal closed. I got the bonus.
 and good work...
and perseverance.
Congratulations on your new job.
Congratulations on getting me
out of your office.
 It's not hard
to spot a mother
who works outside the home.
Just look for someone
who dresses in a hurry...
eats her breakfast
while rushing to her car...
and applies her makeup
as she drives away.
But the surest way
to spot a mother
who works outside the home?
Just look for a child...
M.J., why aren't you dressed?
We're gonna be late
for our first day of school.
who gets sick
at the worst possible moment.
Hey, guys. How you doing?
He's sick. I'm late.
Thanks for helping.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. I gotta work.
So do I,
and it's my first day
at a new job. I win.
What...
Look, I'd really like
to help you out...
and spend some time
with my best bud, but, uh,
Ms. Nelson's septic tank
is expecting me at 9:00.
You're a plumber. Ms. Nelson
is not expecting you on time.
In fact, if you show up before
dinner, she'll turn cartwheels.
I'm a teacher.
It's different.
Wait, I thought you were
just a teacher's assistant.
Well...
Listen to me.
The whole reason I went back to
work is so we could both afford
to give M.J. The things
we felt he needed.
Now I'm doing my part.
It's time you do yours.
I'll reschedule Ms. Nelson.
I gotta go.
You get lots of rest and drink
plenty of fluids, okay?
You never left me
when I'm sick before.
Oh, I know, Honey.
But mommy has a job now.
Come on. We talked about this.
You understand, right?
Don't be sad.
I am gonna pick you both up
at 6:00.
Yes, it's not hard
to spot a mother
who works outside the home.
Just look for a woman
who leaves her house
every morning
feeling incredibly guilty.
It begins just after sundown,
after a long day at the office,
exhausted people
start coming home.
Some are met by faithful pets...
Some are welcomed
with dry martinis.
Others are greeted
with dinner on the table.
Then there are those
who return
from a long day at work...
only to discover...
unpleasant surprises.
Oh! Good. You got my note.
Come on in.
Okay, Sure.
Uh, where's M.J.?
Here I am, Mommy.
Oh, hey, baby. How's my boy?
I missed you so much.
Are you feeling better?
Yeah.
Katherine made me soup
and read me a story
and showed me
how to play blackjack.
What are
you gonna remember?
Always double down
on a pair of aces.
That's cute.
Where's Mike?
Plumbing emergency.
Ms. Nelson's toilet
began erupting,
and I wasn't busy, so...
Uh-huh.
Well, uh, thank you very much
for helping us out.
Come on, M.J.
It's time to go.
thank you.
We already thanked her,
buddy.
Let's not
make her uncomfortable.
Thank you
for having us over.
We are so honored
to be the first guests
in your new home.
Your stunning new home.
I can't believe this.
The theme of my first place
was Early American beanbag.
Well, it's all Andrew.
He's the one with the taste.
Please.
Uh, he's running late.
Um, do you know why?
Ah, he's cleaning up
a little mess.
Someone didn't know
you couldn't serve
bacon-wrapped shrimp puffs
at a Bar Mitzvah.
I knew. I just thought
if they'd tasted mine,
they might change the rules.
So would you like something
to nibble on before dinner?
Is that cut crystal?
It's exquisite.
Andrew again.
He's got expensive taste.
Thank God he brings in
the big bucks.
He does?
Well, he does now, ever since
you gave him that raise.
That is a delicious snack.
Did you make this?
Uh, yeah. It's just...
party mix.
Oh.
You gave Andrew a raise?
A tiny salary bump.
"Tiny" is not the word for
your extraordinary generosity.
Oh, look!
There's pretzels and cereal.
I can see why
they call it "party mix."
It's like a party in a bowl.
When you say "extraordinary"--
He's exaggerating.
They're children.
It just looks like
a lot of money to them.
My God!
Is this a... '96 Latour?
I know. Andrew bought
a case of it at a wine auction
to celebrate that huge raise.
Once you've had
a few glasses of this,
you're not going to remember
this evening at all.
We'll see.
Boy,
dinner without the kids...
It's nice to eat without
having macaroni thrown at you.
Yes.
Well, we, uh, we really
wanted to find a way
to thank you both.
Thank us for what?
Saving our marriage.
Please. It was our pleasure.
How did we do that again?
Well, Bradley had been
working around the clock,
and I was feeling neglected.
But things are different
now that he has Carlos.
We have never felt closer.
And, Gaby, I know I've been
relying on Carlos a lot.
I-I hope it's not a problem, his
being away from home so much.
Oh, I'll be
more willing to forgive
once his bonus check comes in.
And the only person
more excited than Gaby
about that bonus is her jeweler.
Brad, don't.
It's been such a nice night.
He's gonna hear it tomorrow anyway.
Hear what?
Look, I'm sorry,
but we're forgoing bonuses
this year.
Can I get anyone dessert?
Beat it. What?
It's the economy.
Um, our C.F.O. feels we need
to do some belt tightening.
But do you know how much
overtime Carlos has pulled?
How many trips he's taken?
He's killed himself.
For God sakes,
don't do this to my jeweler.
But, Gaby, no one's getting
a bonus, not even Brad.
So this was his bonus? A salad
and a stuffed chicken breast?
Look, hopefully next year
will be better.
We're ready for dessert now.
Wrap up ten lobsters to go.
Ahem.
Tom?
Come here.
We haven't had a customer
in about a half an hour,
so maybe we should just...
close up early.
No. I got an idea.
Hey, everybody, hey,
take off your aprons
and come sit near the window.
What is this?
It's called psychology.
Come on! Hey! Guys...
Nobody wants to eat
in an empty restaurant, right?
So, guys, this is
what we are gonna do.
As soon as you see
someone go by,
you laugh, act like
you're having a great time.
It'll draw them in.
So now we have
pretend customers?
Gee, let's think
of something to do
with all the pretend money
we're gonna make.
Trust me. This is gonna work.
Okay, hey, you guys,
you're a group
of old high school buddies.
You haven't seen each other
since the big game.
And you two--
you're on a hot date, okay?
All right.
Hey, look! There's somebody!
Laugh! Have a great time.
Awesome. Just like that.
Okay...
As much as I love
Tommy Scavo's improv theater,
we need to face some facts here.
It's a slump.
We--we--we--we'll ride it out.
We've done it before.
We--
It's not a slump.
In this economy, people aren't
eating out as much.
Between that
and Porter's legal bills
and paying Bree back,
we are about a week away
from going bankrupt.
Honey, please, have a little faith.
I did, for seven years.
Now I'm gonna be a realist,
and I need you to be one, too.
Okay, I understand.
You're worried. I am, too.
But we can make it.
We just have to be creative.
But--
if we sell this place now,
We can escape with some dignity
and maybe even some money.
But if we keep on going
like we are,
We're gonna lose everything.
No!
No.
I am not going out
like this.
I am not gonna be
a failure.
Please tell me they just saw a customer.
So with all the calories
we just burned,
I say we deserve a huge lunch
at a fancy restaurant.
You do like to live well, Honey.
Well, why not? Life is brief
and mostly sucks.
Gotta grab
all the good you can
while you're
on this side of the dirt.
That was very poetic.
But sure,
we'll go any place you want.
Mmm! That was easy.
Well, since I'm on a roll,
how about this?
Let's go away this weekend--
pick a five-star hotel with
a great spa and just live it up.
I don't know about that.
I've got a lot of stuff
I need to do.
Oh, come on.
Big fluffy robes,
long massages.
Do you hear that?
That buzzing.
Uh... No, I don't hear anything.
Oh, maybe it--it's--
Shh! Shh!
I hear it up here sometimes.
What the hell is it?
Hey, you know what?
I kind of like that hotel idea.
Really?
Yeah. You were right.
Life is brief.
Why don't you go call the travel
agent and see what's available?
You know, you're kinda sexy
when you buckle.
I'm gonna call right now.
Dr. Heller?
Listen, I got your latest text,
but you know,
it's been a few weeks now,
and people are freaking out
about you being gone so long.
So now there's a staff meeting
on the 15th,
and if you're not back by then,
I'm just gonna
have to tell people
that I don't know where you are.
So will you please just call me?
Hey, Mike. How's it going?
Well, so far, I've broken off
three of these stupid
plastic sprinkler heads.
But other than that, I'm great.
Well, good.
Look, I was coming over to ask,
what would you and Katherine
think about going camping?
Oh, man, I love camping. When?
Well, my schedule
gets busy on the 15th,
so it would have to be
before then.
I don't know, this weekend?
Oh, I'm definitely up for it.
Uh, I'm not sure
if Katherine will be.
Well, if she doesn't go,
then Edie won't go, and...
Well, I guess if Katherine
knows another girl's coming,
maybe I can convince her.
Good. Tell her the menfolk
will do all the hard work--
Build the fires,
dig the latrines.
Hey, I wouldn't mention
that, uh, latrine part
until we're actually
at the campsite.
That's a good point.
I'll, uh, dig my gear out
tonight. It's gonna be fun.
Yeah.
This is gonna be fun.
My, that's a beautiful pen
Is it a Montblanc?
Uh, yeah. Yeah, I've always wanted one.
Ah.
Well, I guess you can afford it
now with your new raise.
Oh, you heard about that?
I sure did.
Well, the Chamber of
Commerce just called.
They've added 40 people
to their guest list.
Damn it.
I only planned for a hundred.
W-we're gonna need tables.
Relax. They always pull this crap.
So I called the rental company
and had 'em put a few extras
on the truck. We'll be fine.
Oh, thank God.
But you know what?
We can tell the Chamber people
That because it was
so last-minute,
we had to bump our fee by 30%.
I like the way you think.
Ohh. What would we do
without him?
Hmm, yes. He's worth
every penny you pay him.
By the way...
how many pennies is that?
I'm not discussing
Andrew's salary with you.
It's none of your business.
You're right. It's not.
So... How much?
Andrew moved into a new home.
I simply gave him
a cost of living increase.
The cost of living in a home
with silver pens
and rare French wines?
Honey, please don't do this.
Oh, my God.
Is he making more than me?
Orson, drop it.
I am not telling you
how much Andrew makes.
I'd be happy to give you
that information, sir.
Am I speaking
to the account holder?
No, I'm her...
business partner.
Very well. Account number?
Yes. Um, 8-5-9-7-3.
Name on the account?
Van de Kamp's
old-fashioned foods.
And the password?
Password?
For security purses.
Um...
Oh. Yes. Of course.
It's, um...
Uh, you know...
Uh, it's--it's completely
slipped my mind.
It's the name
of her childhood pet.
Oh. Right.
Uh...
Fluffy.
Nope. That's not it.
Fido?
No.
Spot? Rover?
Mittens?
Sorry, sir.
Uh, Marmaduke.
Old Yeller.
I cannot give out
you information
without the password,
which you obviously don't know.
Then ask me
a different question.
How about her date of birth?
Her social security number?
Good-bye, sir.
How about
her real hair color?
Trust me, it's not
what you think it is.
If you're looking to get fed,
it's gonna be a while.
No, Dad called a family meeting.
Yeah, Mom, he said
it's about the restaurant.
Oh, boy. I think I know
what this is about.
Listen, kids,
things have been tough
down at the restaurant,
and i think your dad
has finally decided to sell it.
Wow.
I know.
Is he gonna be okay?
I don't know. That's why we all
have to be really supportive.
Are you with me?
Hey, guys.
Good. You're all here.
I love you, Daddy.
Not yet.
So... I wanted to talk
to you all about our pizzeria.
Just know we're 100% behind you.
That means a lot,
'cause this was
a really rough day for me.
I had to let
all our employees go.
So starting tomorrow...
you kids are my new waitstaff.
Tom, what the hell
are you talking about?
I got it all worked out.
You and I will handle the days,
and the kids will join us after
school and on the weekends.
Um, at the risk
of sounding spoiled... no.
Come on! It'll be fantastic.
We'll love working together.
Why? We don't even like
living together.
Look,
labor is our number one cost.
If we can eliminate it, we'll
start making a profit again.
What, you're not even
gonna pay us?
I'm 9! Is that even legal?
I think so.
But just to be safe,
you're now 15. Happy birthday!
Mom, please do something.
I ought maybe
after our conversation today,
you'd realize
it's time to pack it in.
I have got to do this. I can't
walk away from that place
until I have done everything
that I can possibly think of.
But having the kids work there?
You said that you were behind me 100%.
Really?
That doesn't sound like me.
Lynette...
Okay. Fine.
Kids, we are going
to support your father
by working
in his restaurant.
You've got to be kidding me.
Just so you know,
30 years from now,
when you and Dad are old and feeble--
You're putting us
in the cheapest nursing home
you can find.
Yeah, I got it.
Mrs. Solis,
I didn't realize you were here.
I've got your bracelet
I polished
and ready for a night
on the town.
Oh, put it on
and have a good time.
Turns out I'm not gonna be
able to afford it right now...
unless you can help me out
on the price.
What did you have in mind?
You give it to me,
and then call your insurance
and say it was stolen?
I didn't think so.
I'm really sorry about
the bracelet, Mrs. Solis.
Perhaps I can show you something
a bit less expensive.
Maybe some, uh, earrings--
Oh, will you excuse me a minute?
Ah!
Carlos! Get in Here!
I got a real shockeroo
for you!
You are not gonna
believe this!
Brad! Hi.
Uh, what's going on?
He just stopped by
with great news.
I'm getting that bonus
after all.
Really?
Well, I went to our C.F.O.,
And I told him
it just didn't seem fair
that my right-hand man
should go unrewarded.
Isn't that great?
What kind of guy does that?
Oh, I think I know the kind.
So, Brad...
What sort of bonus
are we looking at?
How does 20 grand sound?
Like a great jumping off point.
Gaby.
Oh, honey, you heard Maria
the other night.
Your hard work is what's
brought them so much closer.
Pay no attention to my wife.
20 grand is a fantastic bonus.
You know, now that I hear
the number out loud,
it does seem a little low,
after all you've done.
25 is probably more fair.
Oh, Brad. Come on.
Saving a marriage?
You can't put price on that...
at least not a small one.
Gaby, will you knock it off?
You're being rude.
You're right. I'm sorry.
It's just--I really wanted
to buy this bracelet I saw today
downtown in this little jewelry shop.
You know the place, honey.
It's right next to the,
um...
Lexington hotel.
30!
$30,000.
Are you sure?
Yes! You deserve it.
You both do.
I don't know what to say.
You're the only one
getting a bonus,
so what I think
might be best is
if we all agreed
not to say anything.
Do we all agree?
Absolutely.
Now if you'll excuse me,
I'll leave you two to business.
All this negotiating just
goes right over my head.
Ha!
Thunder McFadden.
What a hoot.
What's that?
Oh, it's my porn name.
Friend sent me an e-mail.
You take the name
of your childhood pet
and the street you grew up on,
and voil!
That's the name you'd use
if you were a porn star.
So I'm Thunder McFadden.
My buddy here is
Snoop Windemere.
Mm.
Hey, who would you be?
Orson, I'm preparing
a buffet for 200.
I don't have time to explore
my hypothetical career
in the adult film industry.
Fine.
But you should know that's
why people find you so rigid,
because you can never
just let go and have fun.
Coco Saugatuck. Happy now?
Sure am.
Thanks, hon.
Of course it could just
easily be Munchy Cedarhurst.
What?
Or Taffy Swallow.
We moved around lot
and had three dogs.
Bree, focus.
It has to be your favorite pet.
Like if I asked you,
"what's your childhood pet?"
This is the one you'd say.
Well, I didn't really have a favorite.
I loved them all equally.
Oh, please. If Coco,
Taffy and Munchy were
in a burning building and
you could only save one...
Orson, why are
you being so morbid?
No. I-I just want
to know your porn name.
Okay, fine.
If I had to pick a favorite,
I guess it would be Munchy.
She was a bit rambunctious.
Father sent her to a farm
so she'd have room to run.
I cried for weeks and weeks.
Munchy, huh? This was fun.
All right, that's
a large mushroom pepperoni pizza
and two salads.
I'll get that started.
Tom, I got
need a large--
Large pep/mush at table nine.
I'm way ahead of you.
Thanks. And do you have
the calzones for table three?
Oh, crap.
Setie, I need two dinner salads.
What's the matter?
Parker said the only
reason you had me make salads
is because
it's a job for babies.
Well, clearly, that's not true
because you're not a baby.
You're 15, remember?
Also, I can't find my band-aid.
Okay, you fill water glasses.
I'll make the salads.
Hey, Mom?
Yeah?
This is for table five.
Oh, thanks.
Yeah.
Uh... you didn't give them
enough change.
Yeah, I know.
I figured this out.
You can short people 1%,
and they won't even notice.
If they got a buzz on, 3%.
Okay, you make the salads.
I'll handle the register.
Dude, back off.
That's my table.
Not anymore. You can take
the 4-top of old farts.
No way. I--
What's going on?
He took my table.
So? Take another one.
What's the difference?
Well, since I'm the only one
here who can wait on that table
without knocking over a glass
with my pants,
how about I take it?
You handle the cash register.
You bus tables. Go on.
Well, look at this.
Everybody's happy.
Things are running smoothly.
Don't worry. I'm not gonna say,
"I told you so."
Hey. Katherine said
you wanted to talk to me.
Yeah. Come on in.
You know, you could have
just called.
You don't have to use her
as an intermediary.
Really? I thought
we were using Katherine
for all sorts of things--
sending messages,
raising our kid.
I don't see
what the big deal is.
I have to work,
and she has some free time.
It's better for everybody.
Well, it's not better for me,
especially when
I'm not even told about it.
Fine. Here I am telling you.
I have to work Friday,
so Katherine will be
picking M.J. up from school.
No.
What do you mean, "no"?
Let me remind you,
I have custody on Fridays.
Hey, thanks.
Let me remind you
that the reason
I agreed to custody is
so our son could spend time
with his father.
You have a problem with Katherine?
No, she's a peach,
but she's not the one
that dragged me to court
to hammer out
some custody agreement.
Now if you'd like,
we can go back,
and the judge can explain to you
the difference between
you and your girlfriend.
Okay, you listen to me.
Mommy?
Are you guys fighting?
No, sweetie.
We are just trying to figure out
what is best for you.
Aren't we?
I'll see you Friday, buddy.
Looks like I'll be
picking you up from school.
Andrew makes twice as much as me?
Who told you that?
A little bird
or should I say
a little dog named Munchy?
That's why you wanted to know
the names of my pets?
Orson Hodge,
you are shameful.
What's shameful is
how much you're paying him.
Andrew has been with me
since I launched the company.
He runs every aspect
of the business.
He deserves what he's making.
But I am your husband,
for crying out loud.
Yes, Orson, we're all aware
of how you got the job.
You know
what the real travesty is?
I'm more educated
than the lot of you.
I went to grad school. I'm a dentist.
No, you were a dentist.
Now you're a caterer,
and you're paid fairly
based on your expertise
and contribution.
Oh, this is not about money,
Bree. It's about value.
And you're saying I'm worthless.
No, I'm just saying
you're worth... less.
I'm sorry, Honey.
I'm just being honest.
Very well.
Oh, since we're being honest,
Munchy didn't go to any farm.
That's what parents
tell their kids
When they just had their pets
gassed.
Hey.
Hi. You got a minute? I have
a really big favor to ask you.
Uh, sure.
I need
a little detective work done.
It's about Bradley.
So...
What's going on?
I'm gonna buy a golf club.
A baseball bat would be cheaper.
Maybe I should let you finish.
See, I don't know anything
about golf clubs,
But I know Carlos does,
so I was hoping you guys
could snoop around
and find out
what kind of driver Brad wants.
Oh, it's a gift.
Sure, yeah.
We'd love to help out.
So what's the occasion?
No occasion.
I just want to thank him
for being a wonderful husband.
Well, don't spend to much.
Why don't you
just get him a card?
So our marriage counselor said
we should get each other
little gifts now and then
to keep things spontaneous.
Oh, you're in counseling.
That's great.
We were, but we stopped.
We don't need it anymore.
Are you sure about that?
Yeah. Brad and I are solid.
Well, ice is solid, too,
until it cracks and you're
drowning in freezing water.
I'd stay in counseling
if I were you.
Gaby, I'm home! Can you come
in here for a minute?
Brad gives me a huge bonus
and you repay him
by telling his wife that
they need marriage counseling?
I'm sorry. I think they do.
Their marriage is
none of your business.
Besides, I think they're
a very happy couple.
Who? Him and Maria
or him and the blonde I
saw him kissing yesterday?
What? No way!
Yeah. And Brad saw me.
Why do you think
your bonus jumped
from a stuffed chicken breast
to 30 grand in a day?
Oh, my God.
This is illegal.
I'm getting a bonus no one else
is getting based on blackmail.
You're welcome.
I can't believe you did this.
Well, thank God
you came to your senses.
All right, let's get in there
and tell her.
No, we can't tell her. We'd have
to give the money back.
Don't we have a moral
responsibility to tell her?
It's like you said--
Their marriage is
none of our business.
He's the one who's cheating.
If we say anything,
it'll just make things worse.
We're the good guys here,
Carlos.
Really? 'cause it sure
doesn't feel like it.
It's open.
Susan, you got our message.
Yes, and imagine my surprise,
'cause the last time
I talked to Mike,
he promised me he was
picking up M.J. from school.
Oh, Mrs. Nelson had
another plumbing emergency.
Apparently this
new oat bran diet she's on--
I don't need the details.
I had a long day.
I just want to pick up my kid.
Mommy, we had paninis
for dinner. You want one?
No, thank you. Let's go.
But we were gonna make brownies
for dessert.
But we can make brownies
at home.
The box kind? Katherine says
those aren't real brownies.
Except when your mommy
makes them with love.
Good save.
Let's go.
Susan?
Look,
I know you were surprised
to find M.J. here again today,
But I really was trying
to do you a favor.
Well, I don't need you
to do me any favors.
What I need is for everyone
to just stick to the plan.
Monday, Wednesday, Friday--
Mike watches his son.
He doesn't pawn him off
on his girlfriend.
I had a really fun time.
Big group coming in. It is
now officially Saturday night.
Finally.
Oh, great. They're kids.
1 plate of spaghetti and
15 baskets of free bread.
Stop being such a downer.
We're finally making a go
of this place.
All you want to do is complain.
We're taking a break. N-not now.
We just got a big party.
Good luck with that.
We're outta here.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
What's going on here?
Those kids go our school.
And you know who that big guy is?
Kevin McDermott. The guy
called me "Jesus" for a year
'cause I wore sandals one day.
If he sees me wearing this,
I'll never hear the end of it.
Fine. Don't wear that apron. That's...
No, I'm not waiting
on a kid who's gonna make fun
of me on Monday morning.
It's humiliating enough
having to work here.
Humiliating?
Guys, easy.
No, you're- you're not humiliated
when you use the money
that we make here
to buy your clothes.
Tom, it's fine. I'll take the table.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Your mother can't wait
on this whole restaurant by herself.
Well, then you do it.
Porter, I'm your father
and your boss,
and I'm telling you right now
to go take that table.
Or what, you're gonna fire me?
Go for it.
You think this is a joke?
This is my life!
Tom!
You worry about being embarrassed?
I have put everything I
have into this restaurant!
All right, that's enough!
Let go of him! Let go of him!
Let go of him!
Guys?
I just sat a 12-top.
Who's taking it?
I will.
I started getting our accounts
in order.
If we're gonna sell
this place,
We should probably know exactly
how much it's worth.
I think this can all wait
until morning.
Don't you?
Hey. I just booked us
into the Brunswick Inn
For this weekend.
Great.
Prepare to be pampered!
Oh, shoot.
This weekend isn't gonna work.
Mike really wants us
to do that camping trip
that we've
been talking about.
Camping? Have you met me?
I figured
you were gonna say that.
I just can't blow him off.
This is the only weekend
that works for him.
Then you're on your own.
Have fun wiping with leaves.
Oh, Edie?
Please don't tell Katherine
that you're not coming.
All right?
Mike really wants her there,
and if she hears that you're
not going, she won't either.
Will you take me
to the Brunswick Inn
next weekend?
Yes.
Then I won't say a word
to Katherine.
Hey.
When did you two get here?
Just a minute ago.
They said they have
something personal
they want to talk to us about.
Oh, really? What is it?
We're pregnant.
Oh, wow.
Yay!
I know. We are so happy.
But that's not all.
See, even though
we've only known each other
for a short time,
your friendship
has meant a lot to us,
which is why Maria feels strongly
that you should be
the baby's godparents.
Do you hear that, Carlos?
Godparents.
Yay!
You are such good people,
so kindhearted and decent,
and that is
the kind of influence
that we want in our baby's life.
How could we say no?
Oh!
Oh!
Oh. I see you got your bracelet
after all.
Oh, yeah.
Uh, but I'm not enjoying it
as much as I thought I would.
Ok, watching a movie.
You are one lucky boy.
I'm gonna take
a quick shower.
Try not to get any crumbs
on the couch.
What's wrong?
It's peanut butter,
no crusts--
your favorite.
I want a panini.
I don't know
how to make paninis.
It's just turkey and cheese.
Do we have any provolone?
No, we do not have
any provolone.
Can we borrow some
from Katherine?
Absolutely not.
In this house, we do not eat
pretentious cheeses.
We eat
honest American peanut butter.
Now watch your movie,
and I'll be back in a minute.
Will you make me a panini?
Uh, well, sure, sweetie.
Does your mommy know you're here?
Hey, sweetie.
How was your sandwich?
M.J.?
M.J., Honey, where are you?
M.J., where are you?!
M.J.!
M.J.!
What is he doing here?
He wanted panini,
said you knew.
M.J., go wait
outside on the porch.
I need to talk to Katherine.
You can take the sandwich.
Look, he showed up
on my doorstep.
He seemed hungry.
You think I don't feed my kid?
Okay, well, maybe he just
wanted to come see me.
Yeah, 'cause you make it
like Disneyland over here,
with your paninis
and your blackjack.
You're trying
to do everything you can
to make him think that
you're the other mommy.
What?
You're trying to get your hooks
deeper into Mike
by showing him how
much his son loves you.
Susan, I am being nice
to the child of the man I'm dating.
How does that make me evil?
No, not evil. Devious.
Well, you know,
I hate to tell you,
but your big plan is
not gonna work,
'cause from now on, M.J. is
either at my house or Mike's.
He is no longer allowed to be here.
Yeah, uh, that's gonna be tricky.
Well, that's the way it's gonna
be, whether you like it or not.
No, it's gonna be tricky
because Mike's moving in here.
What?
First of the month,
he's giving up his place
and moving in with me.
So M.J. is going to be
spending a lot of time here,
whether you like it or not.
Orson, I'm glad you're here.
I was doing a recount
of the goblets
for the Hopkins
wedding reception,
and we're short by about 30...
Oh.
So I have to run over
to the supplier
and pick up the rest.
Could you hold down the fort for me?
Sure. No problem.
Thanks.
Hey, you know, Andrew? It
never would have occurred to me
to do a recount of the goblets.
Bree's lucky to have
someone as conscientious
as you working here.
Wow.
Thank you, Orson.
That--
that means a lot to me.
It begins just after sunrise.
After a good night's sleep,
people leave their homes
to go to work.
They do this
so they can provide
a better life
for their families...
afford to buy nice things...
and have a reason
to get up in the morning.
And when their exhausting work
is done,
people come back home again...
and some
begin counting the days...
till their next vacation.

Previously on desperate housewive...
Dave got caught.
You changeyoyour name and
you're living in fairview.
It's not healthy or safe.
Gaby got leverage.
I'm getting that bonus after all.
So,brad,what sort of
bonus are we looking at?
Katherine dropped a bomb.
Mike's moving in here.
What?
Tom called it quits.
If we're gonna sell this place, we should
probably know exactly how much it's worth.
And bree got honest...
You're paid based on your contribution.
You're saying I'm worthless.
No,I'm just saying you're worth... Less.
Which resulted in some strange behavior.
Everyone who met orson hodge
knew he believed in being polite.
He greeted his neighbors
each day with a sunny...
Good morning.
He opened doors for young
women with a gallant...
Allow me.
If he bumped into a
stranger on the street...
He'd cheerfully say...
I beg your pardon.
And if one of his friends was having a
hard time, orson was the first to say...
You need some help there?
Whether his friend
wanted his help or not.
Orson. What are you doing here?
Well,i heard about your going out of business
sale, and I thought you could use a hand.
I'm good. Thanks.
This is charming.
Oh,it's a salt shaker my grandfather
gave me used to display it on the shelf.
How much you want for it?
It's not for sale.
Everything in that box is
stuff I'm taking with me.
Okay. Just trying to help out.
I know it's a difficult day,
and I think i,of all people,
Understand what it is
you're going through.
Why you "of all people"?
Well,i know what it's like to have
your livelihood suddenly vanish.
Remember,i used to be a dentist.
Right. Right.
Of course,it's not
really the same,is it?
What n not?
My business started going
sout because of a bad economy.
It got worse when my son was accused
of a crime that he didn't commit,
But you lost your license because you
went to prison for a crime youdid commit.
Why are you being this way?
Because what's happening
to me is unfair.
What happened to you was...
Justice?
Yeah,and to compare my situation
with yours, on a day like this,
Well,i gotta tell you,it's
a little insulting.
Then I apologize.
My intention was never to insult you.
I wanted to support you in
your--in your hour of need.
Um,vultures are starting to arrive.
I'll leave you to it,then.
Yes,everyone who met orson hodge
knew he believed in being polite.
What they didn't know
is that he also believed
in punishing those who weren't.

Desperate
Housewives Season05 Episode16</font>
The day after mike delfino
moved in with katherine mayfair,
She thought it would be
nice to share her happiness,
So she decided to throw a housewarming
party for her friends and neighbors.
But from the moment the first
invitation was delivered,
Her friends began making assumptions
about those who had been invited...
And about those who hadn't.
I know it's late nicice,but I do
hope you'llllll be able to make it.
Now does this really mean no gifts,
or is it like when gaby says "no
gifts" and she means nocheap gifts?
You know,katherine,if you need any
help, I would be happy to make my fam--
hey,guys. What are we talking about?
The federal deficit.
That sucker's big!
Actually,susan,we were talking
about my hsewarming party.
Oh,yeah. I'm so excited.
You got my r.s.v.p.,right?
Yes. I'm so glad you're coming.
Oh,um,by the way, can you
bring your blue punch bowl?
Absolutely. Anything else you need?
What's happening here?
Why isn't hair being pulled?
Why would we do that?
Um,let's see. She's
shacking up with your ex?
Something which,when I do it,i
get an angry mob on mfrfront lawn.
I mean,let's be honest,susan.
You weren't exactly over the moon when
you heard they were gonna live together.
Well,yes,i was upset at first.
But,you know,mike was gonna
be with someone eventually,
And I consider myself lucky
that it was someone,who,
after all is said and done,has
always been my true friend.
Susan,that's very sweet.
And admirable.
And abnormal.
Hey,gaby,remember
when I was with carlos?
Shut it,bitch.
See? That's normal.
I'll give you. $6,000 for it.
What? It's a $12,000 oven.
There's a dent in the door.
Not a dent. A fist print.
My husband's been a
little frustrated lately.
On the plus side, it matches
the shoe print on the dishwasher.
$6,200--take
it or leave it.
Fine. Congratulations. You
just stole a pizza oven.
I got $6,200oror the oven.
What? That guy is ripping us off.
Yeah,well,putting an "everything must go"
sign kind of eroded our bargaining position.
How are we doing on the other stuff?
Well,by the end of the day, we should
be able to pay off our creditors,
Give bree back the $20,000 that we owe
her and have enough to live on for...
45 minutes.
Forget I asked.
I don't want to talk
about it now. Just...
Look,i know this is
a crappy day for you,
but we need to start thinking about
what our plans are going to be.
I told you,I'm gonna get a job.
And that is so great.
So when do you think that
great thing might happen?
Lynette,don't. It's taken everything
gogot not to lose it right now.
Sorry.
You honestly think you're gonna get
$200 for that cappuccino machine?
I'll give you $50.
50 bucks?
Are you--
I think you better stop
with the bargain hunting
Unless you want your face to
match the oven and the dishwasher.
Hey,guys!
What the hell are they doing here?
They had theater tickets,and
their sitter canceled.
We're only gonna watch their
kids for a couple hours.
Good idea,gaby. We're helping
the slimeball cheat on his wife.
Why not babysit for him,too?
Oh,you guys are angels for doing this.
Well,what are friends for?
Speaking of which, thanks for
hooking brad up with his new girl.
Uh,shayla,right?
You know,that hairstylist
you recommended--
Uh,i was at the mall making an
appointment, and maria walked by.
Oh,that shayla.
How many shaylas do you know?
Two. Two.There's,uh,shayla
the hairstylist
and then there's this other shayla
I know who's a home-wrecking whore.
Hey,carlos. Uh,why don't you take,uh,maria and
the kids inside and introduce them to the girls?
Come on in.
All right. Let's go.
Yoyou're using me as an alibi now?
I paid you 30 grand. I
want my money's worth.
And by the way,your tennis game with maria
tomorrow- you need to move it to noon.
Why? So you can go
get another "haircut"?
Shayla's got a couple hours o,,
and I want to spend 'em thth her.
Well,bradley,we all want things.
For instance,i would like carlos
to have a week off next month.
Impossible. It's our busiest time.
Come on,brad. We don't want to be late.
Oh,gaby,we're still on for
tennis tomorrow,right? 4:00?
4:00? Let me think.
Actually,noon would be better
for me. Could you do noon?
Oh,i was supposed to have lunch
with brad. Do you mind,sweetie?
Well,i was really looking forward to it,
but,uh... Go ahead. You girls have fun.
Listen to him. Can you believe this guy?
Nope. He is not to be believed.
My,what an interesting coat
hanger. It's shaped like a sofa.
Please put it in the closet.
Sorry,darling.
Orson?
Why do you have a salt
shaker from scavo's pizzeria?
I stopped by to express my sympathies
with tom, and i-i remember l-looking at it,
And i-i guess I absentmindedly
put it in my pocket.
Well,take it back
now.They're liquidating,
and they're gonna need
every penny they can get.
Ma... I want to stay here with y.
Me no like-a the
scavos so much-a.
No?
No.
Very well. Though I'm not lkiking
forward to going down there again.
Rereally?
Yes. I only went down there to
commiserate, and he was very dismissive.
Tom has a lot on his mind.
I'm sure he didn't mean it.
You weren't there,bree.
He was downright rude.
Yoyou know,it would serve
him right if I kept this.
Don't be ridiculous.
Tom's rudeness does not
give you license to steal.
Return it immediately.
Ma,you- you such
a pretty girl.
I wanna live-a here with you.
Oh,great. You found the punch bowl.
Washed,eaeaned,ready to go.
Sorry about the mess.
Mike's still unpacking.
Hey,did you manage to keep that
antler chandelier out of here?
Yeah. That went right to the garage.
The tough one was the framed towel
with some football guy's sweat ont.
That "footba g guy" is peyton manning.
You would do well to learn that name.
Oh,now that I really love.
I almost couldn't believe he had something that nice.
Thank you.
For what?
I painted it. It was a gift for him.
Really?
You painted that. He didn't mention it.
Yeah. It was a little beach
we went to for our honeymoon.
Uh,i mean,you know how
much mike loves the ocean.
Yeah. Now I can see it every day.
Anyway,um,can't wait for
the party. It's gonna be fun.
Yep.
I'm sorry you have to go
through this. It must be so hard.
The hard part was when my
friend tried help me with a loan,
And I thanked her by becoming
a lunatic and denting her car.
Now that you brought it up, lynette,I've
been feeling just awful about the way
I took over your restaurant
and insulted you and...
What can I say?
I think we have the kind of friendship
where you don't have to say anything.
Let's just hug and move on.
Okay?
How's tom holding up?
He's doing great.
Isn't it noon?
Yeah. He's up early today.
He just doesn't know
what he's doing next.
Maybe I can help.My publisher is thinking
about dog g his advertising in-house,
and he's been looking for someone.
Seriously?
Yeah.
Oh,my god. That would be great.
And if he gets the job,you
can actually cash the check.
I te y you what. I will invite bruce
over for dinner, you and tom can join us,
And we'll turn it into a
low pressure job interview.
Thank you. This will
really cheer tom up.
Great. I'll call bruce this afternoon.
Could you call him now?
Hey,mike.
Oh,I'm looking forward to one
of your world-famous martinis.
So was mrs. Mccluskey.
She got here early.
Yeah,but don't panic. I
sent edie out for more booze.
So you sent the mouse to
buy the cheese. Well done.
Well,look who's here.
Somebody owes me $20.
How about we let it ride?
Double or nothing--mccluskey
slugs someone by 5:00.
Katherine and I told you guys
we were taking the high road.
Why won't you believe us?
Because I vividly remember yesterday,
and I wasn't born during it.
Let me show you something I
think might change your mind.
So katherine has a picture that I painted
for mike hanging over her mantelpiece.
Does she know you painted it?
Yes,and we talked all
about it. She loves it.
You painted that? You're good.
What? Where the hell is it?
Bye-bye,high road.
What's with the puss?
Katherine hung one of mike's paintings over
the mantel till she found out susan painted it.
Then she took it down.
Something tells me this
party's about to get good.
You know,there could be a
perfectly innocent explanation.
Hey,kathy. What happened
to susan's painting?
I am such a klutz.
I was dusting yesterday,
and,well,it just fell.
The glass shattered,and ugh. It took it
to the framer. It'll be back in a jiffy.
Excuse me.
See a perfectly innocent...
Bald-faced lie.
It is possible.
I just drained a pitcher of
martinis. I'm not buying it.
Really,susan,there's not a woman in the world
who doesn't know what "i broke it dusting" means.
That's how I got rid of tom's last
bottle of "musk,the cologne for men."
All right,you guys tnknk what you nt.
I'm gonna choose to believe her.
All right,so we have whiskey and
bourbon. What else does mike want?
Bup,bup,bup. We need a system.
Let's start over there in scotland, head over
to russia and work our way arou t the globe.
It's crowded in here.
They're all buying lottery
tickets. The jackpot's $100 million.
Look. There's a priest.
I knew that vow of poverty was a crock.
Hello!
You remember me. Father drance.
I-i didn't kw w you'd
moved back to the area.
Oh,i just remembered. Mike wants vermouth.
Can you grab that before we forget?
Sure. Right away.
It's wonderful to see
yo looking so well.
shut up.
I'm only gonna say this
once. I've moved on.
I've remarried,i have a new life, and
that t the way I want it to stay--new.
Of course.
So,uh,what was that about?
He said we sat together
once on a airplane.
Apparently he's less
memorable than he thinks he is.
Come on. Don't want to miss the party.
Fine. Fine.
I will do it,but you owe me. I gotta go.
Let me guess. Brad.
Yes,he wants me to take
maria shopping tomorrow.
Yeah,so he can grab a quickie.
You know,this whole thing is
disgusting. I can't take it anymore.
I know. Just keep reminding yourself
that we're getngng things out of it,too.
Things I don't want.
Things I haven't earned.
No,I'm gonna tell bradley we're out.
What? You can't do that.
You'll lose your job and all that money.
I don't care about the money.
I do... And so does my personal
shopper and pilates instructor.
Gaby,no. We're doing the right thing.
Or we can...
Make someone else do the right thing.
Gaby,what does that mean?
It means...
Tomorrow I'm going to the mall
to get my hair cut by a slut.
Uh,look at what I
found- my beach painting.
Oh,yeah. Katherine told me
it broke. Sorry about that.
Yeah,that's what she td d
me,too, ononly,uh,it didn't.
That's weird. Why would she...
I don't owow.
She seemed to love the painting...
Until I told her that I painted it.
Excuse me just a minute.
I'm not making a big deal.
I just want to know why you lied.
Mike,please,not now. We
have a house full of guests.
No,we'll talk about this now.
What are you doing?
Uh,nothing.
Susan showed me the painting.
There's not a scratch on it.
She what?
You didn't.
Susan!
I hope you enjoyed that.
I didn't.
I didn't.
So what are we thinking?
Well,shayla- it
is shayla,right?
I need a fresh look.
I've been going through some pretty
intense pepersonal stuff lately.
Really?
Fine. I'll tell you.
I have been having an
affair with a married man,
And it's come to that point where I
can't even look at myself in the mirror.
So I want a new style that says
I'm not a giant turd of sin.
Well,it's not your fault that you
fell in love with a married man.
Yeah,that's what I thought at first,
and then I realized that's stupid.
I mean,what about his poor wife?
Well,maybe she doesn't love him enough.
Oh,no. She does. She loves him plenty.
So you want to take the
bangs up a little bit?
And he has kids- two
adorable little kids.
That's sad, but sometimes you
just have to look out for yourself.
Well,maybe I am tired of being
that kind of selfish bitch.
Have you ever considered,uh,highlights?
Focus,shayla!
We are talking about how I'm
ruining innocent people's lives.
Gaby,you seem like a lovely,warm person.
Stop beating yourself up.
Oh,for god sakes,you
bleached blonde twit.
I'm not talking about me. I'm
talking about you and bradley.
What? What--what is
this? Who--who are you?
I'm a friend of maria's,who,by the way,
happens to be a warm and lovely person.
Well,maybe she is,but
brad doesn't love her.
He says he's gonna leave her.
Oh,shayla,he's lying. She's pregnant.
That's impossible. They
haven't had sex in over a year.
Well,call the vatican, 'cause we're
gonna need a manger and some hay.
Get out.
I'm just trying to protect you here.
I said get out now.
Okay,let's just take a deep breath here--
let's not do anything we're gonna regret.
Now.
This is why people should never
get their hair cut in a mall!
You couldn't shave?
Come on,tom.
You need to look nice.
Bree's going to a lot of
trouble for this dinner.
What,is she debuting a new salmon puff?
Okay.
I was going to wait to tell you
this when you were in a good mood,
But I realize that's not gonna happen,so bree
has a special guest tonight,her publisher...
And as luck would have it,he's looking
to hire a new marketing executive.
Oh,my god.
What are you- are you tricking
me ininto a job interview?
I'll find something,okay?
I just need some time.
You're grieving.
I get it.
But this sounds like a fantastic job.
Please just hear the guy
out and make a nice...
Impression.
Fine.
I'll shave.
And brush your teeth.
My eyes are watering.
And don't just wet the toothbrush.
I can tell.
Bruce.
Hello.
Come on in.
Thank you so much for
joining us tonight.
May I take your coat?
Sure.
Oh,wait. Let me get my
"brain" out of there.
I never go anywhere without this.
That way,when I
get a bright idea--
Right into the tape recorder.
Sounds like quite a handy gizmo.
Thank you,orville.
It's ors.
Orville,orson--either way,he came home
from the playground covered in bruises.
Am I right?
Idea for children's book- kid who gets the crap
kicked out of him 'cause he has a goofy name.
Ululd be "orson."
Oh,that's them.
Wait till you meet tom.
You'll be so glad you
had that tape recorder.
He's just bursting with ideas.
Lynette,tom,hi.
I'd like you to me my publisher,bruce.
It's nice to meet you.
Bree,I'm getting a
beer,if you don't mind.
Hey,katherine.
Mike is standing across the street
watching to make sure I apologize,
Even though it's clear to me you're the one who
should be apologizing for the way you ruined my party.
One,two,three.
Well,that should be long enough,so here.
Kikiss my ass.
Bye.
Hold on.
I'm sorry.
But neither of us exactly gets
a gold star for model behavior.
It's not the same.
Why not?
I mean,you loved that painting until you found
out that I did it,and then you acted totally petty.
So why am I the only bad guy here?
Let me ask you something,okay?
Didn't it give you just the tiniest
little thrill to tell me that that painting
That I was so happy about was yours?
That I had something in my house that
represented the love between you and mike?
No.
Thenhat are you doing,susan?
Can't you see how hard this is for me?
You live right across the street.
You guys share a kid.
Do I have to have a painting
of your honeymoon,too?
Look,i knew I wasn't going to
get a clean slate with mike,okay?
I ju wanted a clean mantelpiece.
Fantastic dinner,bree.
This was a great idea.
Well,i just wanted to get
you together with tom here.
I thought you two might hit it off.
Yeah.
Tom,bree says you used
to be quite the ad wiz.
Oh,i don't know.
He'seieing modest. He was the best.
Good,because I'm looking for
someone to head up a new division.
I'm going to put some coffee on.
Orson,would you give me a hand?
Let these three chat.
So do you think you have any
interest in getting back in the game?
I don't know.
The timing's a little weird.
How so?
I don't know.
Well,tom was just running a very successful
restaurant,and he just sold it at a handsome pritit.
So he's waiting for
the right opportunity.
You might have to do a
little selling here,bruce.
I guess the good ones are
always the hardest to land.
Yeah
let me give it a shot.
We represent a small stable of elite
nonfiction authors from all over the world.
So you'd be working closely with those writers to come
up with creative approaches to selling their books.
That sounds...Amazi.
I don't know.
Are there more potatoes?
You can have mine.
Stop saying,"i don't know."
Sounds like there's a lot of traveling.
I'm not,you know,really big
on living out of a suitcase.
Even to do two weeks at the book fair in
pari while you stay at a five-star hotel?
Paris?
Like france?
Yes,like the greatest city in the world.
Gee,I'm getting lynette excited.
Too badyou don't have any
advertising experience.
Actually,i have 12 years of experience.
Really?
Yeah.
I was account executive for eight
years,v.p.for four more after that,
And by the way,i wrote my graduate thesis
on the rise of the nonfiction novel.
I know.
So what kind of starting
salary are we talking about?
Lynette,can I see you for a sec?
Okay.
Bruce,could you hold that thought?
I'm gonna be right back.
Well,we're on pins and needles.
How's it going?
What the hell are you doing?
I'm getting this job.
That's what I'm doing.
I thought it wasmy job.
Well,you're not acting like
you want it very much,mister...
"uh,i don't know. Are
there any more potatoes?"
it's not that I don't want it.
It's just that itit's
all happening so fast.
I need a little ti to lick my wounds.
Okay,you lick.
I'm going to paris.
You're not taking my job.
Your job?
The one you're magically gonna get
by sulking and acting like a brat?
You had a shot.
You blew it.
Oh,yeah?
Yeah.
You just messed with the bull,sister.
Prepare to get the horns.
I...
Maybe we should slice the tart in here.
I don't want to bring
a large knife in this.
Bruce...
I was just saying to lynette,I gave you my "i
don't really care about this job" thing to see
If you really care about this
job,and you do,and I like that.
Clever.
Now we haven't talked compensation
package yet,but I got a good feeling...
You know,tom,you're right.
Bruce does care about this job.
That's why he wants to make sure
he gets the perfect person for it.
Well,lynette,you yourself
said I was the best.
Oh,you were.
You were the best person
who ever worked for me.
I used to be his boss.
This is not what I had in mind.
I don't know why either one of
them wants to work for that jackass.
Now,now. He's been very good to me.
Well,of coue he has,because he
knows you make him a lot of money.
Me,on the other hand,he sees
a an insignificant little man,
Barely worth mentioning as he talks into
his annoying,penis-shaped tape recorder.
So I said to him,"je crois que c'est
l'homme qui fait les chez d'oeuvres."
And he said to me,"non,lynette. Ce sont
les chez d'oeuvres qui font l'homme."
Great story...
I assume.
I don't speak another language,but I've had
ad campaigns translated into 12 different ones,
Including professor
crispy's potato chips.
I love that campaign.
You did that?
I did.
Yes.
Tom was very good at his
job,right up until he got fired.
Well,actually,i was
relieved to get fired.
My boss was kind of a ballbuster.
She's right here.
Je regrette.
Would anyone care for something sweet?
I knowi would.
Well,we've all had our troubles
as bosses,haven't we,tom?
I was sort of sugarcoating it when I
said his restaurant was very successful.
The truth is,he mismanaged that
pizza joint right into the ground.
Let me be very clear.
I think lynette is fantastic.
She is a great manager,she's got terrific
people skills and is very reliable...
As long as the cancer
doesn't flare up again.
You know what?
It's getting late.
I  should probably t the
road   but what about the job?
Yeah...
I just started looking.
I'm sure it's gonna be a long process,but
trust me,you've certainly made an impression.
I'll get your coat.
Oh,it's a shame you
can't stay for dessert.
I've made tarte tatin.
Idea for novel...
Woman who's married to a
gay man and doesn't know it.
Well,thanks again.
I don't know whei'I've had
such an interesting evening.
I'll call you tomorrow.
We'll talk about your friends.
Uh,bruce,why don't I wrap up
a piece of that tart to go?
Yeah.
Give it.
Give what?
Bruce's tape recorder.
I don't know what...
You took it.I saw you.
Has anybody seen my tape recorder?
It was right here.
I'i'll look.
Stop.
I don't have it.
What do you call this?
Uh,bruce is looking for,uh...
Never mind.
We will talk about this later.
Look what got brought in
with the dirty napkins.
Thanks.
Hello,gaby.
Jeez,bradley,you scared me!
You talked to shayla.
Yeah,she's a real gem.
You shouldn't have done that.
Weavave a deal.
Well,I'm tireofof the deal,and what
you're doing to maria is despicable.
You're in no position to judge me.
Don't forget,i was working with
carlos when you cheated on him.
Yeah,well,I'm not that person anymore.
I've changed.
Right.
You're worse.
You're so worried about maria until
there's money or vacation time at stake.
Then you're only worried about gaby.
You know what?
You're right.
I'm out.
What do you mean?
Deal's over.
I'm not covering for your
stupid little fling anymore.
It's not a fling.
I love her.
She's the most incredible
woman I've ever met.
Shayla?
She has a hello kitttitip jar.
Well,she makes meapappy.
I can't give her up.
Well,at least be man enough to tell
maria,because if you don't,i will.
All right,fine.
I will tell maria.
And you can tell carlos to bring a box
to work on monday 'cause he's fired.
So dinner...
Lynette,i will regret fofor the
rest of my life what I said tonight.
I...
I don't know what's going on with me.
I do,and it's okay.
Besides,did you hear
what came out ofmy mouth?
Like I said...
Wouldn't you love to hear what bruce said
into his tape recorder on the ride home?
"idea...
Check local mental hospital
for escaped married couple."
So...
Were you serious about
wanting to go back to work?
I was talking about that job tonight and trying to
convince bruce I was good,and I remembered something.
I am good.
And I would like another
chance to prove it.
Okay.
Really?
Yeah.
We did my thing for seven years.
Now it's your turn.
Do you know how embarrassed I would
have bee if bruce had seen you take it?
He deserved it.
He insulted me.
So say something.
Stand up to him.
But stealing?
Honestly,orson,why would
you do something like that?
I don't know,bree.
I don't.
Here's something I do know...
When I was a successful dentist,no
one spoke to me the way they do now.
When I lost my practice,i
lost people's respect.
And you hope to earn
it back through larceny?
You haven't walked in my shoes.
Tom lost his job.
Everyone jumped to his rescue.
Even you...
Bending over backwards
trying to get him a job.
I don't need to walk
in your shoes,orson.
What youidid was embarrassing and
childish,and it's never gonna happen again.
Understood?
See you.Thank you.
Father?
Yes.Can I help you?
Oh,i hope so.
I,uh,saw you the other night when
you were buying your lottery ticket.
I was withy y husband dave.
Yes.
He said that you barely know each
other,but it didn't seem that way to me.
And,well,he refuses
to talk about his past,
So if there is anything that
you could tell me about him...
I'm not sure I can do that.
Please.
He has so many secrets,and I
n'n't have anyone else to turn to.
I wish I could help you,but...
This is something you need
to discuss with your husband.
Well,if it was that easy,do
you think that I would be here?
I'm sorry.
Please know that my thoughts
are with you both,mrs. Dash.
It's williams.
I'm too old-school for my own good.
I shouldn't just assume that
you took your husband's name.
Anyway...
Good luck,mrs. Williams.
Hey,susan.
I thought I had m.j.till 0000.
Uh,you do.
I am here to take my painting back.
But you gave it to me.It's mine.
Well,now I'm ungiving it.
Try to keep up.
Okay,if this is about what
happened at the housewarming...
Itis,actually,because that is when I
decided that I don't want this piece of art
That I slaved over hanging in the house
you are sharing with your new girlfriend.
Capisce?
Okay,so the other night you were m because it
wasn't hanging up,but now you want to take it?
Yep.I'm complicated like that.
Aren't you glad you divorced me?
If you two want a painting
so bad,paint your own.
Susan...
Mayfair.
Stay out of this.
This is between me and my ex.
Got it?
Unbelievable.
Anyway,I'm thinking a brighter
color for the baby's room.
Now I know it's a bit of a stretch,but
how do you feel about turquoise?
Sweetheart?
We need to talk.
What you reading?
The want ads.
Can't decide if I should be a data
entry operator or join the marines.
I'm so sorry.
Don't be.
I told you,i hated
working for that jackass.
You did the right thing.
I should have done it sooner.
But you did it,even though you knew
you were gonna lose a lot of money.
You're a good person,babe.
I'm veryroroud of you.
Well,that means a lot,coming
from a united states marine.
Hello?
Maria.
Ca down.
Calm down.
Okay,we're coming over.
I guess bradley told her.
Thanks for coming.
I didn't know who else to call.
Itas horrible.
He just kept telling me he loves her.
She's the best thing
that ever happened to him.
He finally understands what love means.
I just wanted him to stop talking.
You should never be too impressed
by people with good manners.
They're the ones who will give a friendly
wave even when they've stolen from you...
They're the type to
sweetly welcome you...
Even as they try to
uncover your secrets...
They're the kind to offer you coffee,even
as they report you to the police.
And don't be too offended by
someone who's openly rude...
Because they may be that way
Previously on Desperate Housewives.
Before we met,
I was married to someone else.
But she died.
Edie's quest began.
What would you and Katherine think
about going camping?
It's going to be fun.
And Dave's
plan moved forward.
This is gonna be fun.
Were you serious
about wanting to go back to work?
Lynette took a new path.
Now it's your turn.
Tell Carlos he's fired.
But it was Carlos' boss...
He just kept telling me he loves her.
... who was terminated.
I just wanted him to stop talking.
Come on, Gabby!
We're going to be late.
Gabrielle Solis hated going to funerals,
for all sorts of reasons.
Black was not her color.
Crying depressed her.
And lilies made her sneeze.
Also, Gabrielle despised any event
where she was not
the center of attention.
Luckily, at this funeral,
that would not be a problem.
Gabby! I was hoping you'd be here.
Everyone is saying that you
and Carlos were there.
You know, when Maria killed Bradley.
You know, Jody, I really don't think
this is the time or place
to discuss gory details.
You're absolutely right.
Sit next to me at the wake.
I want to go home.
We just got here.
Funeral hasn't even started.
Yeah, well, I have a feeling
most of these vultures
didn't come to pay their respects
to Brad.
They're just here to pump us
for dirt about his murder.
Even so, I can't be seen
walking out of here early.
These people are my co-workers.
Were your co-workers.
Bradley fired you, remember?
Yeah, and Maria killed him
eight hours later.
He might not have told anyone.
So pipe down.
We don't need people thinking
that we put the knife into Maria's hands.
Carlos.
Oh, hi!
Gabby, this is Owen Johnson.
Our CEO.
Oh, hi!
How do you do?
I know it's an awkward time,
but I must catch a plane right after
the service, and I need to talk to you.
About what?
Bradley called me before he died.
He wanted to discuss
your job performance.
Well, what did he say?
Well, sadly, by the time
I returned the call, he was dead.
Really?
But I think I know what
he wanted to tell me.
Oh!
Based upon the big bonus
he fought for Carlos to have,
it's fairly obvious he was going
to recommend a promotion.
That was my guess, too.
The terrible irony is,
he didn't realize the job
he was recommending
would turn out to be his own.
Wait. So, you're offering me Bradley's
job as president of the company?
I can't think of anyone better suited.
Now, of course, it would be
the same compensation package.
Please, tell me you'll accept.
He sure will.
The man has a plane to catch.
I'd be honored to step in for Bradley.
Good.
I'm glad we've got that handled.
Now we can focus on the sorrow
of this tragic day.
Mmm.
The same compensation package!
We're rich!
We are at a funeral. Please be quiet.
Okay.
Yes, Gabrielle Solis
hated going to funerals.
And for God's sake, stop smiling.
Mostly because
she couldn't pretend to be sad
when she wasn't.
You can find them
on any sidewalk in any city,
people with agendas.
The woman who calls up an old friend
because she wants
to borrow some cash.
The man who takes his boss to lunch
because he wants the corner office.
The girl who looks after her uncle
because she wants to be in the will.
Yes, you can find these people
almost anywhere,
doing what they can
to keep their agendas hidden.
Hello.
Hello.
I need to look someone up
in your archives.
It's a client, and he's a bit
of a smooth talker,
just want to make sure
that he's not giving me the runaround.
Sure. What's his name?
David Dash.
All I've got here are the obituaries.
Anything else will take me
a couple of days.
Fine. Let's start with the obits.
No David.
That's probably because he's not dead.
Try Lila.
Lila Dash.
Killed three years ago, car crash.
That was his wife. Give me that one.
Okay.
You want Paige Dash, too?
Paige?
Yeah. Their daughter.
"Paige Dash, three years old.
Daughter of Lila and David."
Says here she died in the same crash.
Who are we dishing?
I do hope it's not me.
No, we've already covered you.
We've moved on to my daughter,
the thief.
Oh, dear. What happened?
I'm missing my small candy dish.
I had it last night
when you guys were over for dinner,
because I remember Orson admiring it.
Yes. I remember that.
Anyway, Juanita went over
before breakfast
to invite MJ to her birthday party,
and, well, candy plus Juanita.
You don't have to be Sherlock Holmes
to crack this case.
Well, we don't know that for sure.
I could have misplaced it.
I'm sure it'll turn up somewhere.
Well, I'm off.
Andrew, cancel my lunch.
No, everything's fine.
Your stepfather's just misplaced
a few things and I need to find them.
Hey, Tom. No, still waiting.
Big surprise, they're running behind
at an ad agency.
So did any of those
other places call back?
Seriously? Six interviews and nothing.
Well, I should probably try
and keep my game face on here.
I'll... I'll call you later. I love you. Bye.
Mariana! I had a feeling
that you'd be interviewing for this!
Hey, Nikki.
So I guess Anna should be
showing up any minute, too.
No. You didn't hear? She's pregnant.
Oh, my God.
A kid, and she just turned 30?
Bye-bye career.
Oh. Don't start.
I'm going to be 30 in two years.
I feel so old.
Do you want to know
what's even sadder?
I just heard that Veronica's
looking for work.
And she's 39.
In this business? After 35 they take you
out back and they shoot you in the face.
Lynette Scavo, we're ready for you.
Coming.
Do me a favor, if you hear a gunshot,
tell my four kids I love them.
Now, as you listen to the music,
see what pops into your head.
What shapes does it make you see?
What colors are you thinking of?
Why are the children
drawing with crayons?
They're supposed
to be making clay vases.
Well, I wanted
to do something more free.
It's an imagination-building exercise.
Looks like a lot of scribbling to me.
Susan, these parents pay $22,000
a year to send their kids here.
As art teachers, it's our job
to give them something adorable
to put on their desks, to smile at
while they write those tuition checks.
I mean, no one's going to find this
meaningless chicken scratch adorable.
Not yours, Mia.
Yours shows real promise.
Jessie, you said that I could
plan the lesson today
and I think this is valuable.
I'm just trying to be creative.
Fine. But you know where I stand.
What's an evalley-ation, Miss Susan?
An "evaluation"?
Well, that is when someone judges
your work and gives you a grade on it.
But don't worry,
I'm not doing that today.
No, they're doing it to you.
Who?
Miss Jessie and Principal Hobson.
I heard them talking.
Oh, right. That's not until later this year.
No, it's this week.
I hope you don't get fired.
The lady with
the purple sweater argued
with Miss Jessie like you did,
and she's gone.
The lady with the purple sweater?
I never learned her name.
She wasn't here that long.
She was creative, too.
All right, everyone, grab some clay,
we're making vases.
Darling! I'm home!
Oh, and I'm famished.
What are we having for dinner?
How about a confession?
Sit down.
Start talking.
What do you want me to say?
I want you to explain to me
why this insanity is still going on.
When you stole that tape recorder,
you said it was a one-time thing,
an impulsive act of revenge.
It was, at first.
But then, I know it sounds odd,
but it started giving me a thrill.
A thrill?
Stealing a ceramic duck
gives you a thrill?
It's hard to explain.
Well, maybe you'd feel more
comfortable talking to a professional.
A psychiatrist?
Good heavens, Bree, I'm not crazy.
Look, I'll stop. I'll... I'll tell everyone
I'm sorry and return everything.
You will do no such thing.
From this moment on,
you are forbidden
from entering
any of our friends' homes.
But how are we going
to get these things back?
I'll take care of it.
I'm so glad you could make it.
I know I sprung this on you
at the last minute.
Oh, actually, I was just going to watch
a DVD and order some take-out.
So I'm looking forward
to a home-cooked meal.
Oh, well, keep looking.
Because I don't cook,
and Shanghai Panda delivers.
Well, that'll be fine.
You know, Susan, I was
a little surprised to get your invitation.
Oh, well, you know, I just think that
school is such a formal environment
and I thought it would be nice
if we could let loose
and drink a little wine,
get to know each other.
Oh, my gosh!
What?
Look at you.
You're like that schoolmarm
in the movies
who lets down her hair and
va-va-va-voom!
I've never gotten
a va-va-va-voom before.
Thanks. You look nice, too.
Oh, please.
I didn't even get a chance to change.
My ex was late picking up MJ,
which is insane because
he lives right across the street.
Your ex lives across the street?
He decided to shack up
with my best friend.
And people wonder
why I'm through with men.
So, what are we toasting to?
Getting to know each other better.
Oh, napkins.
I'll drink to that.
Oh, hey, Mike, come on in.
I went a little crazy
at the camping supply store.
Hey, check this out.
I got Katherine her own lantern.
I know she was a little worried
about finding the latrine
in the middle of the night.
Actually, that's why I came by.
Katherine sort of bailed.
Bailed.
You mean she's not going camping
with us?
She's really sorry,
but she's got to get her taxes done.
So Katherine is blowing us off
for taxes?
Also, I think she's worried
she'd just be a third wheel.
What? Oh, come on.
I mean, this trip is as much
about her as it is about us.
Tell her she's got to come.
First of all,
I don't tell Katherine to do anything.
And it'll be better with just us guys.
We can burp and scratch
to our heart's content.
Besides, Katherine was never part
of the original plan, anyway.
No, she wasn't.
All right, I'll see you Saturday.
Yeah!
You're not listening to me.
I'm not saying I'm giving up on love,
I'm saying I've already given up.
No! I will not let you.
You are too smart, and funny,
and adorable.
Am I?
It's been a long time
since I've been complimented like that.
Well, I mean it.
Anyone would be lucky to have you.
You are a catch.
Jeez, how did it get so late?
Is there a school policy
on showing up to work drunk?
It's frowned upon.
I had the best time tonight.
Oh, me, too.
But you know, I think we should
probably keep this between us.
We don't want people talking at work.
It'll be our little secret.
So, you think you might want
to do this again some time?
It's a date.
Va-va-va-voom.
So what kind of kiss
are we talking about?
A regular kiss on the mouth that lasted
a little longer than I thought it would.
So was it a good old-fashioned
American kiss,
or are we talking the infinitely
superior French variety?
Okay, I'm probably
just blowing this out of proportion.
I mean, she never even
said anything about being gay.
Well, that doesn't make any difference.
Right, Lee?
Why ask me?
Aside from the occasional parade,
gay men rarely interact
with lesbians in the wild.
Susan, if you're not sure
what she meant by it,
why don't you just have a talk with her?
Oh, that would be way too awkward.
She's my boss.
She's your boss?
Let her kiss you again, then sue her.
Okay, we're going
to figure this out for you.
Were her eyes open or shut?
I don't know.
Well, how many seconds
did the kiss last?
I don't remember.
Oh, for God's sake. Was it this?
Or was it this?
The second one.
Congratulations.
You're now dating a lesbian.
See you at the parade.
Hey, Gabby? I'll see you.
Bye.
I wanted to ask you something.
Feel free to say no.
Oh, honey, I'm flattered,
but I only did that to help Susan out.
Yeah, this isn't about that.
I wanted to say I heard about Carlos'
big promotion. Congratulations.
Thank you.
I mean, it's sad how it happened, but,
you know, when opportunity knocks,
you've got to answer the door, right?
Absolutely. Now, you know,
I'm looking for work?
Oh, yeah. How's that going?
Not great.
See, while I was working at Scavo's,
I got seven years older,
which is weird, seeing as how
all the CEOs got seven years younger.
The bottom line is,
no one wants to hire someone
who could have made out
with their dad on prom night.
Anyway, I hear Carlos is looking
for a new director of marketing.
Think you could put in
a good word for me?
Oh.
I don't know.
You don't know?
Well, I thought you did advertising.
Yes. I helped advertise
what companies decided to market.
It's the same thing. Come on.
You know I'd be great.
I guess.
You guess? Gabby!
Look, Lynette,
you're my friend and I love you.
But as far as knowing
if you're any good at your job...
Enough with the shrugging. Come on.
You're putting me in a tough spot.
Carlos is under a lot of pressure now
and he's not really in a position
to be taking big risks.
You think I'm a big risk?
Well...
Okay, that's it. Fourth shrug, I'm out.
Thanks for your help.
Yeah, just follow the road as it curves.
We're the second house on the left.
Okay, bye.
Place looks great, babe.
Thanks for doing this.
It's all part of being the president's wife.
So tell me about your new hire.
She's going to be your number two?
Yeah, and I'm lucky to get her.
Smart as a whip, Harvard MBA.
I've probably mentioned her before.
Lucy Blackburn.
Maybe I'll go put on some music.
Lucy Blackburn?
Please tell me it's a coincidence
that your new VP
has the same name
as your ex-girlfriend.
She wasn't my girlfriend.
We were roommates,
we shared an apartment.
You told me you slept with her.
Well, it was a small apartment.
Come on, it was a casual thing
and it was a million years ago.
I don't care!
Why couldn't you have told me this
before she's about to appear
on my doorstep?
I wanted to, but you were always next
to something sharp.
Gabby, I am in over my head
with this new job,
and I need Lucy's help.
Please don't be jealous.
I'm not jealous. It's just...
You can't hire her.
I'm Mrs. President and I get a vote.
There she is.
Now, please, I'm begging you.
Well, you can beg all you want.
I am not on board with this!
Hey, Lucy!
Hey. Hi. I'm Lucy.
You must be Gabrielle.
You can call me Gabby. Come on in.
I'm on board.
I got a bead on Charlie Fields for CFO.
Charlie Fields?
There's no way you're gonna get him.
He's the number two guy
at Brewster and Parent.
Relax, it'll take some maneuvering,
but I'll make it happen.
How?
Carlos, you're the president.
It's best you don't know
where the bodies are buried.
Well, speak of the devil.
If you'll excuse me,
I have some professional ethics
that need compromising.
Wow. Now I know why
you wanted to hire her.
She's a force of nature.
You should see her close a deal.
I bet.
So were you surprised
when the door opened?
What do you mean?
Well, she's obviously
stopped counting calories
since the last time you saw her.
No, she looks about the same.
What? But you two used to have sex.
Yeah. So?
So don't get me wrong, she's attractive.
It's just, she's not really your type.
Your type is skinny model.
Okay, so you're not going
to see her on a runway.
Except maybe at an airport.
Gabby!
You think I'm that shallow,
that all I go by is looks?
Yeah. I thought that was something
we had in common.
Look, Lucy is brilliant, and witty,
and has more confidence
than anybody I've ever met.
That type of personality
can be very seductive.
Someone light me a cigar.
You got him?
I find poaching is easier when you
lead with, "We'll double your salary."
Sizzle me.
There it is. That thrill you get
from taking something that's not yours.
Hey! Are you still looking
for a marketing director?
I have a friend that I would love
to see working with you two.
No problem, Bree.
We buy Aspirin by the pound
in this house. I'll get you some.
Oh, you're a lifesaver!
Yes, we have lots of screwdrivers.
What kind do you need? Phillips head?
Yes, that would be lovely.
I don't have cumin,
but I probably have cinnamon.
Oh! Close enough.
Yeah, no problem.
Two eggs, coming right up.
Oh, wait.
I made omelets this morning,
so I'm all out.
Oh, that's all right.
I'll just go to the store.
Where did that come from?
Oh, I don't know, but it's awfully cute.
Unbelievable.
Juanita, get your butt down here!
Why are you calling Juanita?
To find out what McCluskey's
sleeping Mexican is doing in my house.
That's not yours?
No. Why would you think that?
Oh, I don't know.
But, you know, there it is.
It's been sitting
on McCluskey's porch for years.
I keep telling her how racist it is.
First the candy bowl and now this?
How many times have I told you
not to steal?
I didn't take that.
Juanita, you play with it
every time we go by Mrs. McCluskey's.
Now either tell me the truth or
I'm going to cancel your birthday party.
I am telling the truth.
That's it. Party's over.
Gabby, aren't you being a little harsh?
I mean, perhaps she didn't take it.
Well, then how else did it get here?
Maybe she did it.
Juanita!
Whenever my children stole,
I sent them to bed without any supper.
Just a thought.
Orson! Orson! Orson, Orson!
Orson! Stop!
Hi, Bree!
What were you doing
at Bob and Lee's?
Oh, they invited me over for coffee.
After I told you to stay out
of the neighbors' houses?
You stole again, didn't you?
No. No, I didn't.
What're you hiding behind your back?
Nothing.
It's mine.
You're telling me you own a mug with a
picture of Bernadette Peters in Gypsy?
This is quite a rsum you've got here.
Northwestern, huh?
Yep. Thank you.
So, Lynette...
How old are you?
Mr. Vivinetto, I'm not obligated
to answer. It's the law.
Right, right.
I was only asking because I...
I also went to Northwestern, I thought
maybe we crossed paths there.
Oh.
What... What year did you graduate?
Well, if I was dumb enough
to answer that,
I never would have gotten
into Northwestern.
I understand.
But I'm going to be honest here.
We have certain accounts that cater
to specific demographics...
Okay, I'm going to stop you.
What is this obsession with age?
I am a vital woman with passion,
and a library of knowledge
when it comes to this industry.
Why doesn't that count for something?
What I'm saying is, we just landed
the Cosgrove's Revitalizing Serum
account.
It's an anti-wrinkle cream,
and I need someone more mature
who can identify with the...
I'm 54.
He didn't even flinch.
I said I was 54 and he bought it.
There was not a
"Wow, you look great for your age."
Not even a courtesy gasp.
Look, you got the job,
you're making $80,000 a year.
What does it matter?
It matters because I'm only 43.
And I look like I'm 39.
You're 43? But I'm two years younger
than you and...
Nobody cares how old you are, Tom.
Hi!
Great news, you got the job!
Yeah. How'd you hear about it?
Hear about it? Honey, I did it.
I talked to Carlos. You're in.
Oh, wow. That job.
I don't know what to say.
Say, "How do I thank you,
greatest friend in the world?
"What's your birth stone?"
Well, thank you, greatest friend,
but I just accepted another job.
Well, un-accept it.
You have to take this job.
It's essential that you be there.
Why?
Because it's a great opportunity.
I'm confused.
Before you didn't even want
to talk to him.
You weren't even sure I was good.
Yeah. Yes.
And then I went home and thought,
"What a horrible thing
to say to such a dear, dear friend
"who's probably really,
really good at her job."
So I said,
"Carlos, you have to hire Lynette."
I don't know.
Well, he'd have to match
my current offer.
Yeah, okay. What are they paying?
Hundred thousand a year.
I don't think that'll be a problem.
Oh.
By the way, you're going
to be reporting to this woman, Lucy.
She's a real star. So you're going
to want to keep an eye on her.
Decaf soy latte. Your favorite.
Thanks.
I was thinking about the other night...
Me, too.
Maybe Friday you could come over to
my place and we could hang out, or...
You know, I... I think you may
have gotten the wrong impression.
I'm not into women.
Mmm-hmm.
Nice boots.
I thought it was going to rain, okay?
Really, I'm not gay.
Mmm-hmm.
Then what was all that stuff about
the other night?
The... The touching my knee?
The "Oh, you look so sexy"?
The good-night kiss?
Oh, well, that kiss was all you.
Oh, it was?
I seem to remember you being there
and not pulling away.
Why didn't you say something then?
Well, that's because... Because I...
Because you're tired of living a lie.
What?
I was you 20 years ago, Susan.
You're obviously worried there's
a lesbian inside of you trying to get out.
Actually, I'm more worried
about the lesbian
that's outside of me trying to get in.
Can we just teach the class
and talk about this later?
Fine.
Shouldn't
you be doing your taxes?
Oh, God, Dave. You scared me.
Oh, sorry about that. What's this I
hear about you not going camping?
Oh, well, it is that time of year and
I've got all these receipts to go through.
I've got to say, I'm mighty disappointed.
Please. I'm sure you're relieved
there won't be a girl tagging along
to spoil all your macho fun.
Well, see,
now that's where you're wrong.
I mostly saw this trip as a chance
to get to know you better.
Me? Why?
Katherine, the truth is
I don't have a lot of friends.
Maybe that's why Mike's
become so important to me.
And ever since you came into his life,
well, I can see the change.
He's so much happier.
So much more relaxed.
You've given him
this sort of inner peace.
I just thought it would be cool
to become buddies with the woman
who did that for my friend.
Well, when you put it that way...
So you'll go camping with us?
I'll go start packing my fleece.
Fantastic.
Dave?
You really think I've made that much
of a difference in Mike's life?
Oh, absolutely. If he ever lost you,
it would destroy him.
Okay, class, let's see how our animals
of Africa drawings are going.
Oh, Emma, this is beautiful.
Emma drew a gazelle. Isn't she pretty?
Zachary, is that a rhinoceros?
Wow, he looks so big and strong!
I love rhinos.
Do you, Susan? Do you really?
Excuse me?
I'm just saying, if you were on safari
and you saw a sleek gazelle
next to a grunting, sweaty rhino,
your eye wouldn't go straight
to the gazelle?
Though I would definitely appreciate
the beauty of the gazelle,
if I was going to take a trip to Africa,
I would be more excited
to see the rhinos.
I like rhinos, too.
Yes, we know, Jeffrey.
We've all seen you playing hopscotch
at recess.
Are you gonna tell me that you've never
had any experience with gazelles?
Not even in college?
No. And I was on the softball team.
Look, Susan, why don't you just say it?
This particular gazelle
isn't young enough for you.
And you don't want to hurt my feelings.
That is not true.
And I think we are dangerously close
to no longer speaking in metaphor.
Well, then why were you
so interested in me in the first place?
Why did you ask me to your house?
Because I wanted you
to give me a good evaluation.
I see.
It was nice knowing you, Miss Susan.
The problem, how to attract high
net worth clients in a down economy.
The solution? Be creative.
Christie's is hosting its first ever
sea auction on a yacht in St. Barts.
I see a boat full of millionaires
waiting to be wooed.
This is not a bad idea.
Besides, I haven't been to St. Barts
since you took me there
to celebrate my first promotion.
That was a fun weekend.
Yeah.
Let's do it.
Yeah.
I've got to take this, I'll be right back.
Okay. Okay.
Not to pry, but when you said Carlos
took you to St. Barts...
Oh, yeah, we lived together
for a while back in the day.
Oh.
Gabby didn't mention that.
See, that is what I love about her.
Most women would freak out
if their husband hired an ex-girlfriend,
and they were working together
un-chaperoned.
But she's got the confidence
to just be cool with it.
Yeah. Yeah.
That Gabby's a real class act.
Jessie, I... I'm so sorry.
Why? You were just being honest.
Still, I never meant to lead you on.
Uh-huh.
Well, I was planning on giving you
a good evaluation anyway.
So everything's fine.
Look, I need this job.
But even if I didn't,
I would still like you as a person.
Please, stop. I don't need your pity.
See, now, I don't get
why people say that.
It's like, I love pity.
Pity means someone is trying
to understand
what you're going through.
That they sympathize. And I do.
Susan, I'm someone who never
went out and looked for love.
I assumed it would find me.
But it didn't.
And now I'm making a fool of myself,
throwing myself at straight women,
because I'm so afraid of being alone.
Now how can you possibly
understand that?
Well, here's how, I spent my whole life
putting myself out there,
and I'm still, today, alone. Just like you.
It's not the same.
Well, okay, it's not.
Because I'm alone, but I'm not lonely
because I have friends.
Love doesn't happen for everyone.
You know what, I don't even know
if it's going to happen for me anymore.
But my friends are there for me
no matter what, and that helps.
So at the very least, you know,
let me be there for you as a friend.
That'd be nice.
Do your friends hug?
What's that in the garbage can?
My boots.
Hey! What are you doing here?
I just wanted to see
how your first day went.
Sit. Take a load off. Spill it!
Well, that is so thoughtful of you.
You're such a good friend.
Oh, well, you know me.
Yeah, I do.
So, did you get a good office?
Were the people nice?
Oh, what about Lucy? Did you like her?
Actually, I am kind of tired.
I think I'm going to head inside.
What's going on?
I mention Lucy and you get all weird.
Is something going on with her, Carlos?
What? No.
I'm sure she's just affectionate.
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
what do you mean by affectionate?
Well, it's probably nothing.
But when Carlos works
on his computer at home,
does he take his shirt off there, too?
That son of a... I'm going to kill him.
No, you won't get the chance,
because I'm going to kill you first.
Huh?
The house lights are up, Gabby,
you can drop the act.
You only helped me get this job
because you needed a spy.
How dare you! And, yes, I did.
Gabby!
You needed a job. I did you a favor.
And then I brought you hot cocoa.
Why don't you ever thank me?
Because you used me. At least when
I asked you for a favor, I was up front.
Oh, were you, Miss
"they offered me $ 100,000 a year"?
Oh.
You found out about that?
Honey, I've played poker with you
for the past nine years.
I think I can tell when you're bluffing.
Okay. It's true.
I used you to get more money.
But you used me first.
Fine. We're a couple of users.
The big question is,
are we still friends?
Do I still get my salary?
Will you still be my spy?
Dave, I'm curious about something.
What about?
Well, how do you feel about kids?
Kids?
Yeah. Haven't you ever wanted one?
Is this your coy way of telling me
that you want a child?
Maybe.
I hardly get to see Travers anymore
now that he's off at prep school.
And I always wanted a girl.
Doesn't that sound like heaven?
A beautiful little girl with blonde curls.
I had this friend who had a little girl.
From the moment she was born,
she was his whole life.
Unfortunately, she was in an accident
and died.
He told me that when that happened,
part of him died, too.
He spent the rest of his life
in a kind of daze.
Always wondering exactly
how old she would have been,
what she would have looked like.
No, I don't think I'd want a child.
Just not worth it.
Are you okay, babe?
Yeah, I... Just sad for your friend.
Yeah.
I had hoped that
this compulsion to steal
was something
we could solve privately,
but Orson seems unable, or unwilling,
to control himself.
Is that true, Orson?
Are you unable to control yourself?
You'll see when he leaves
and your lamp is missing.
So how do you want to proceed?
Would you like to begin
with some couples counseling?
This isn't my problem, Dr. Bernstein.
He's the sick one.
Fix him.
You know why she's so angry?
Because this is something
she can't control.
And I love it.
Now, there's no phone in the cabin,
but if it's an emergency,
you can reach me on my cell.
You just be careful out there.
I don't know what I'd do without you.
Bye.
Here's the article that lady
was looking for.
You want me to fax it?
Take your time. She's a pain in the ass.
She's pretty hot, though.
How does that help me?
She can wait until tomorrow.
All right.
You can find them almost anywhere,
friendly people with hidden agendas.
The woman who uses her neighbor
to get herself a job.
The wife who uses her influence
to hire a friendly spy.
The husband who uses his charm
to steal from his friends.
And you can be sure
the friendliest people of all
have agendas
that won't ever be discovered,
not until it's too late.
Previously on...
a thief was confronted.
Well, maybe you'll feel comfortable
talking to a professional.
A psychiatrist?
Someone lit me a cigar.
Carlos hired a old girlfriend...
and Gaby hired a spy.
I talked to Carlos. You're in!
Edie dug deeper into Dave's past.
Killed three years
ago- car crash.
That was his wife. Givee that one.
Their daughter died in the same crash.
And Dave's master plan...
you really think I make that much
of a difference in Mike's life?
If he ever lost you,
it would destroy him.
Entered its final phase.
Is this the ranger station?
Well, I didn't know whether
to call you or fish and game,
but, uh, I think I saw some gu up
at emerson ods hunting illegally,
and I got worried because I know
people like to go camping up there,
and I-I sure wouldn't
want anyonto get hurt.
No, no need to thank me.
I'm just doing my part
as a concerned citizen.
Bye now.
Dave Williams had been
planning the murder for years.
And like all the best
plans, it was a simple one.
First, he would guide Mike Delfino and
Katherine Mayfair to a remote cabin.
The next morning, he'd pretend to be
asleep as the two lovers left to go hiking.
Dave would then grab the
gun he'd carefully hidden...
and start to follow his quarry.
He'd wait until the two had paused
for a moment to catch their breaths.
And then he'd pull the trigger...
breaking the heart of the
man who had killed his wife.
When the rangers arrived, they would mention
the reports of illegal hunters in the area.
And Dave would drive Mike back home,
all the while enjoying his pain.
Yes, Dave Williams had come
up with a very simple plan.
But as he was about to discover...
have you faxed this clipping
to Edie Williams yet?
Um, doing it right now.
There is nothing simple...
about murder.

Desperate
Housewives Season05 Episode18</font>
Life is full of nasty shocks...
unpleasant surprises
that jolt our systems...
and cause our hearts to skip a beat.
and these shocks always occur...
Susan?
Hey, Karl.
When we ast expect them.
Karl. What are you doing here?
Well, I just enrolled Evan.
And I was worried that we'd be
out of each other's lives forever.
Mm, lucky, lucky.
What are you doing here?
I am an art teacher.
Really? Do they know that?
And now I'm ignoring you
and moving on to Evan.
Hello, Evan.
Evan, this is Susan.
She's your sister Julie's mother.
We used to be married.
She was a lot younger then.
Evan, why don't you
head into the classroom?
I need to talk to your daddy, and I
may need to use some grown-up words.
Okay, Susie Q. , What's wrong?
Get it off that chest you
wouldn't let me enhance.
Listen, it's bad enough that I've got
one ex-husband running around the halls.
I don't need the faculty and the
parents knowing that I have two.
So not a word about
us having been married.
No more wisecracks. No Susie Q's.
I am miss Susan, art teacher.
Yes, miss Susan.
Can I bang your erasers after class?
Karl, I'm serious. Don't mess with me.
I have a yardstick, and
I'm not afraid to use it.
we're gonna be making a presentation for
the morrison contract sooner than we planned.
There are a lot of firms gunning
for this, and--damn it, Lynette!
Don't--don't
touch my figurines.
These are worth more than
the house you live in.
Big deal. So is this coffee mug.
All right, we should break for lunch.
No.
Until this deal closes,
we work through lunch.
But as a consolation, we'll
also be working nights.
Nights? You really
think that's necessary?
This is a $10 million deal, Carlos.
How bad do you want it?
You heard the woman.
we're working nights.
Um, I have a tiny scheduling conflict.
I coach my daughter's basketball
team on Friday nights. So if I could--
Friday nights are now work nights.
If we're successful, those of you
on commission stand to do very well.
And those of you who aren't?
Well, you get to keep your jobs, which,
in this economy, is a bonus all by itself.
All right, let's run down to the deli,
grab a sandwich and meet back here in five.
You. No touching.
And, yes, I'll know.
Isn't she fun?
Hey, Carlos.
Did I ever tell you that tom a I seriously
considered you and Gaby for Penny's godparents?
You're not getting Friday nights off.
Look, I'm not happy
about the schedule either.
I'm missing my kids, too.
Then do something about it. You're
the president. Put the brakes on Lucy.
Lynette, I hired her to crack the
whip, and that's what she's doing.
It's good for the company.
But she makes people crazy.
Can't you talk to her, get
her to dial it down a bit?
I will think about it.
But don't be asking me
for favors like this.
When we're at the office, I'm not your neighbor,
I'm not your friend. I'm your boss. Got it?
Oh, by the way, you and tom are
coming over for cocktails on Saturday.
Oh, yeah. I plan to get
drunk and bitch about my boss.
I'm sorry, but this is unacceptable.
Do you at least know why he steals?
If there were some sordid childhood
trauma we could blame it on,
it would really help me
out with the neighbors.
Oh, he knows.
Dr. Bernstein uncovered
that my very first session.
Really? And--and yet
he keeps charging me.
So, doctor, what's this "revelation" that
you've been keeping from me for $200 an hour?
I steal to hurt you.
Why would you want to hurt me?
Each day for the past year,
you have, inch by inch, slice by slice,
brought me closer to being a eunuch.
Would you excuse us for moment?
This just became a private conversation.
If I stay, I might be able to help.
You wanna help?
Why don't you go down to the pharmacy
in the lobby and buy some aspirin?
I'm gonna need it.
I don't deserve this.
I have been nothing busupportive
of you since you got out of jail.
I even gave you a job.
I wanted to be your partner.
You made me an employee.
So you decided to punish me
by resorting to petty theft?
For God sakes, Orson, I'm your wife.
Perhaps, but I'm not your husband.
We may share a bed, but you save
your passion for your company.
That's not true!
Isn't it?
Every day for the past year, I have
been in the background, an afterthought,
while you spend day and night
nurturing your business.
All the while thinking
I had your support.
I tried.
I thought I wouldn't mind
being Mr. Bree Van de Kamp.
But it's killing me.
Every day, I get smaller and smaller.
And if something doesn't change,
Orson Hodge is just gonna
disappear altogether.
Girls are out like a
light. Thanks for dinner.
Carlos, do you have to go back to work?
Gaby, I got a meeting.
But can't Lucy cover it?
You know those two extras zeroes at
the end of my paycheck you like so much?
They're there because I'm
president. Hours are part of the gig.
How about a quickie?
Babe, I don't have time.
Right, that's why I
didn't suggest a longie.
Oh, come on.
I'll have your eyes rolling back
in your head in three minutes flat.
You wanna do it there in
front of the kids' sippy cups?
All gone. Now let's do this.
It'll be like old times.
We never did it on the table.
Yeah, we did, years
ago. Don't you remember?
I don't think that was me.
Right. Well, we'll
create new table memoes.
If you're trying to turn me
on, you just failed miserably.
Carlos, do you realize since Bradley died
and you took over, we haven't had sex once?
I miss you. I wanna spend time with you.
Now move the creamed corn and do me!
Okay, how about tomorrow night?
Yeah, I've heard that before, and then
tomorrow comes, and you're too tired.
Okay, then, this weekend.
I'll be all yours.
And we can defile any
piece of furniture you want.
Hey, Karen, you don't
have any fax paper, do you?
Fax paper! Turn down the Dean Martin!
Don't worry about it. I'll
go to the store tomorrow.
Do you need anything?
Eggs... milk... lightbulbs...
Okay, let's make this easier.
Is there athing you don't need?
I'll tell you what.
I'll call you from the
store in the morning, okay?
One*****
What a lovely rainbow, June.
Here's a gold star for you.
Oh, Drew, wow!
You know, elephants don't have wings,
but I like the way you're thinking.
Hey, Evan, what did you draw?
That's a lot of red.
It's blood.
Okay. So...
that man must be a doctor
making the bloody man all better?
No, he's stabbing him
in the guts with a sword.
Evan, that's... kind of a scary picture.
Nuh-unh, it's fu
No, honey, it's inappropriate,
especially when the assignment was to
make a picture that makes you happy.
This does make me happy.
Where's my gold star?
I just can't get used to everyone working--
first Bree, then Susan, now Lynette.
Thank God for you.
I just had to get out
of that boring house.
So what do you gals do
when you get together?
Mostly gossip.
You got any good gossip?
I heard Ed Simmons got a Harley.
You know, I should get back.
Come on. Give me a break.
I'm still new at this.
Okay. We'll start with something
a little easier--bitching.
I can handle that. Bitch away.
Well, I am so pissed at
Carlos. He is never home.
And when he is, he's
too tired to do anything.
And by "anything," I mean sex.
Are you uncomfortable?
A little. Go on.
Well, we've never had a drought like
this. It's been almost two weeks.
Two weeks? And that's a drought for you?
Yeah. Lately, Carlos just
doesn't want to do it.
Wrong. Guys always wanna do it.
Really?
Yeah.
Even if you're tired and get home late?
Even if we're exhausted and late
and been shot in the leg... twice.
We still want to.
So you just gotta get past the (red adult
to find the horny teenage boy inside.
That's good to know.
You're good at this girl talk thing.
Well, thanks.
So, um, does Lynette ever
talk about me and sex?
Yeah, I should get back.
You called me down here for this?
It's a kid playing with a soccer ball.
It's a head, and he's
stabbing someone with a sword.
Well, maybe it was in self-defense.
Mr. Mayer, generally, when kids exhibit
this type of behavior, there's a problem.
Excuse me. I have to take this. Sorry.
Hello?
Thanks for ratting out
my kid on his first day.
It's not my fault.
I showed this to the
school psychologist.
She gave it to the
principal. My hands were tied.
So right away it's Evan's fault?
Did you ever consider that he
didn't understand the assignment?
I told the class to draw
something that made them happy.
All the other kids drew
kittens and rainbows.
Your son drew small intestines
on the end of a stick.
Let's cut to what this is really about.
You hate me, and you don't
want my son in your class.
That is not true!
It is, too!
You're still punishing me
for what happened between us.
You're stuck in the past and
blaming me for your screwed-up life!
Okay, will someone call Guinness?
Because you just set the world record for
the biggest load of crap in one sentence.
Oh, bite me!
How long was I gone?
This is nothing, Mr. Hobson.
We were just having a
difference of opinion.
Yeah, and my opinion is your teacher
doesn't understand the difference
between emotional
problems and creativity.
Shut up, Karl.
Excuse me.
Did you just tell him to shut up?
You know, this is
typical "Susan" behavior.
And you wonder why no
man can stay with you.
Would this seem any less shocking if I
told you we were once married for 12 years?
Yes, am I speaking to Mr. Dinsmore?
Ah, this is Bree Van de Kamp.
Yes, it's nice to talk to you, too.
Well, as I'm sure you're aware, your company
has made several offers to purchase mine.
Yes, I know I said I wasn't interested,
but some things have happened in my
personal life and I think I'm ready to...
finally make a deal.
Really? Well, that's wonderful.
Why don't you, uh, come to my
office tomorrow and we'll talk?
Good-bye, Mr. Dinsmore.
There you go. The rest is yours.
Thanks. I don't know what it is.
Every time I go to the
market, there's stuff I forget.
I know what it is. You're old.
So where's Dave?
Camping.
Ooh, camping. How fun.
Enjoying the great outdoors, getting a
bunch of teenage kids on prom weekend.
Good for him.
Look, I know that you think
he's some creepy psycho.
But you should know that
he has had a very hard life,
and there are things about
him that you don't understand.
Like what?
Like he was married before, and his wife died in
an accident along with their 3-year-old daughter.
Oh, Edie. Are you sure?
Yes.
So if at times his behavior
seems a little strange,
try to remember the grief he's carrying.
You know, I lost a kid.
It does things to you.
No wonder he...
Oh, God, I wish I'd known.
Well, you do now.
So next time, try to be a
little more understanding.
Of course.
You know, I could use a drink.
Come to my house and we'll
crank up Dean Martin and...
toss a few back. Come on.
Mom?
Oh, Andrew. I didn't hear you come in.
That dinsmore guy is
waiting for you downstairs.
Thank you, dear.
I must say, Bree. I was
surprised to get your call.
You've always said you'd
never sell your company.
Bree has decided she
wants more family time.
She's a very traditional
woman, you know.
It's one of the reasons
I fell in love with her.
Does that mean you're gog
to stop working altogether?
I know your fans have been hoping for
a second book, uh, my wife included.
That's sweet, but I've decided to
focus on other pursuits at the moment.
Mm, yes, her sole ambition
now is to be Mrs. Orson Hodge.
And at the risk of sounding selfish, I'm
glad I'll be the only one she's cooking for.
Were you able to look over
the contracts I sent over?
Oh, shoot. I left them upstairs.
Well, I'll get them.
I'll show you the offices
before we start the demolition.
You're getting rid of your office?
No, we don't need it anymore, and Bree
knows I've always wanted a game room.
So it's your "sole ambition"
to be Mrs. Orson Hodge?
Andrew.
No, I-I have to ask.
Why are you letting
Orson se your company?
It was my idea.
My work has been
compromising my marriage.
I didn't realize the toll
it's been taking on Orson.
Okay, so he's unhappy.
Buy him some golf clubs,
put him on lithium,
but don't give up everything
you've worked so hard for.
Andrew, do you know why
my book sold so well?
Because it was authentic.
I actually believe in the
old-fashioned values I wrote about.
I believe in men opening doors for ladies
and children respecting their elders.
I also believe that sometimes women need
to make sacrifices for their husbands.
I would be the worst kind of
hypoite if I preached these values
and then didn't follow them myself.
Okay, I get it.
You love Orson, and you're willing
to sell your company to prove it.
What I'm wondering
is, is if he loves you,
why would he want you to stop
doing what makes you happy?
You busy?
What is it?
I brought you a little gift.
Cute.
I thought it would be a nice
addition to your collection.
I knew it was you.
Pardon?
You're the one who
complained about me to Carlos.
I'm...not sure what
you're talking about.
Oh, jeez.
What, you knife me in the back, and
now you're gonna play stupid?
Carlos said some people are having problems
with me and that I should watch my demeanor.
And I thought to myself, who
are "some people"?
And then it hit me--
it's the chummy neighbor.
Okay, yes, Carlos and I spoke
briefly, but I thought he blew me off.
So that's your defense?
You thought your
backstabbing was unsuccessful?
well, I'll admit it's kind of flimsy, but
until I got something better...
okay, next time you have an issue
with me, you know where my office is.
Oh, and, uh, as far as Friday
nights are concerned...
consider that a permanent work night.
Don't worry.
If you're as bad at coaching as you are at office
politics, your daughter won't be missing much.
Found the contract.
Everything is in ord.
All we need now is your signature.
Mr. Dinsmore, would you mind if I
speak to my husband for a moment?
Oh, yeah, please, go ahead.
I'll--I'll be right outside.
What's wrong?
this is happening so fast.
Yes, a bit.
But it was your idea.
Well, I have a new idea.
I'd like to wait.
Wait?
Bui-I need this for my recovery.
Just give me one year.
That's not asking too much, is it?
You made me a promise.
You need to stick to it.
Orson, think about how I built
this company from nothing,
how it brings me joy and pride
and a sense of accomplishment.
Is that really something
you want me to give up?
Yes.
Mr. Dinsmore, would you
come back in, please?
So are we ready?
Actually, no.
I'm not selling.
Excuse me?
Tell your wife I will be doing
that second book after all.
Well, I'm--I'm
sorry to hear that.
Bree...what about my problem?
I might start stealing again.
Steal what you must, my love.
But it won't be my company.
Look at him.
He's out like a light already.
That's what a long day
of fishing does to you.
Yeah, well, he's gonna need all of his
energy for our big hike tomorrow, right?
Actually, I don't think
I'm gonna go with you guys.
My knee's been kind of bothering me.
Okay, well, then why don't we wait till
the next day and see how you feel?
No, no, it's fine.
I'm just gonna hang out here.
Besides, it's such a romantic hike.
You guys should do it alone.
You always have such a good attitude.
Do I?
It seems like you take
everything in stride, you know?
Like you just naturally
find the silver lining.
Yeah, I wish it were natural.
I had to teach myself to be this way.
With some of the stuff that's happened to
me, I never would've survived if I hadn't.
So what's your secret?
Oh, I realized that...
I was waiting for
somebody to fix things.
But no one was going to.
It was all up to me.
I had to decide what was
important and go after it.
I had to make myself happy.
Are you?
Happy.
I'm gettin' there.
Why don't you get some sleep?
You got a big day tomorrow.
Come on, Lucy. Why would
you agree to this meeting?
Well, we're overextended as it is.
Fine.
Yeah, I'll see you at the
conference room at 7:00 A.M.
Hi there.
Hey, babe.
What are you doing up?
I couldn't sleep.
I was a little hot.
That's better.
You look a little warm yourself.
Okay, I know where
you're going with this.
Oh, if that were true, your pants
would be around your ankles right now.
Gaby, what are you doing?
I'm releasing the horny
teen inside of you.
Now come on. Two boobs, no waiting.
Damn it, Gaby, I thought we were
gonna wait till the weekend.
I'm tired.
Not my problem.
Actually, it is!
You know, if big Carlos is tired, that
pretty much rules out little Carlos, too.
Now listen up, the pair of you.
I haven't been sitting around in
butt floss all night for my health.
You're putting out.
That's more like it!
Well, I'm awake now.
In fact...
mind if we spice it up a bit?
I forgot these were in the nightstand.
This is gonna be fun.
There. How's that?
Tight, just the way I like it.
Me, too.
Good night.
Carlos, where you going?
To go grab a few hours sleep
before I have to get back to work.
Carlos, get back here!
Carlos!
Could you at least scratch my nose?
Amy, that is very sweet.
I love the colors you used.
Oh, Danielle, that is just beautiful.
Evan, that is very pretty.
You did the assignment
just like I asked. Good job!
That's not mine.
Annie asked me to bring hers up for her.
This one's mine.
Fairview man won't be charged
in accident that killed two
I know everything come home now, Edie
I heard a gunshot.
It sounded like a hunting rifle.
Yeah, it almost hit Katherine.
You guys all right?
Yeah, I think so.
Hey, this is a state park. People
aren't supposed to be hunting here.
Well, I guess these guys
don't care about that.
I just wanna get out of here. Please?
Yeah, of course. We'll, uh, go
back and pack, and we'll leave.
Well, sorry, man.
Me, too.
Sorry about last
night, I love you, Carlos
Juanita! Celia! Get your coats on!
We're going to see daddy.
Let me see it.
Okay, just so you know, should be
bringing this to the psychologist.
But I didn't, because this kind of
"self-expression" usually gets a kid expelled.
Just let me see it.
Aw, hell.
Yeah, "aw, hell."
You got a problem here, Karl.
Your son's got some serious anger issues, and
you need to figure out what's going on.
I know what's going on.
This is his mom.
Marisa?
Well, why would he draw a
picture of her like this?
She left us...six weeks ago.
Karl...
I woke up one day to find her
standing there with her bags packed.
She said she was overwhelmed, that she loved
Evan but she wasn't cut out to be a mother.
So she just left?
So here I am, alone, raising this boy.
And it's obvious I'm not
doing a very good job.
You must be loving this.
Why?
'Cause I did the exact
same thing to you.
Yeah.
You know, I can understand why you react the way
you do when you bump into me, why it bothers you.
I never really got it until just now.
I usedo hope that one day, you would know
what this fe like, and now that you do...
I'm so sorry.
Hey, Lynette!
Great office.
I see you're busy.
Don't let me disturb you.
I just wanted to drop off the girls
so I could talk to Carlos for a sec.
All right, girls, have
fun with aunt Lynette.
You think you can buy
me off with presents?
Gaby, now is not a good time.
Well, I'd say let's talk about it tonight, but
who knows if you're even gonna come home?
Damn it, Gaby.
You're the one that
pushed me take this job.
And ever since I did, all you've done
is complain about how hard I'm working.
You're right, and I'm sorry.
It's just...
I'm scared.
We're turning into what we used to be.
I'm unhappy at home, you're always
working, trying to buy me off wh presents,
too tired to make me feel loved.
We've made these mistakes before, Carlos.
For God sakes, let's not make 'em again.
I made a commitment here, Gaby.
I don't think I can just bail.
I know you can't, and that's
the part that really scares me.
We're bored.
Hey, I got you sodas, didn't I?
And I let you feed the paper shredder.
Don't you have any toys?
No. I got a hole puncher.
Sorry. That's the best I could do.
Come on.
What about those glass things?
They're pretty.
Can I hold one?
Oh, sweetie, those aren't to play with, not unless
you wanna see someone go completely bonkers.
Actually, they do look like a lot of fun.
If only I had the power to stop you...
what the hell are you doing?
We're playing. What does it look like?
Are these your kids?
'Cause they were in my office playing
with my figurines, which are imported.
They're worth a lot of dinero.
Do you even undstand what I'm saying?
What's with the yelling?
I don't know.
I'm just as worried as you are.
Look, let me boil it down for you.
Office?
S?
Day care?
No!
Lucy, what's going on?
Apparently, some people don't understand
that this is a place of business,
and they need to keep
their kids at home!
Then I guess you should yell at me.
These are my kids.
Come here, sweetie.
I, uh, I didn't know that.
I-I thought they were
hers 'cause they're...
could you just go?
I'm sorry.
So what if they were?
That's the way you talk to people?
I said I'm sorry.
Look, I-I am trying so hard
to make this deal happen.
I guess the stress
is just getting to me.
It's getting all of us.
Maybe it's a sign we should change
the way we do things around here.
We are trying to play
with the big boys, Carlos.
Now is not the time to pull back.
Don't you want this company to succeed?
I wanna build a company
that treats its people well
and lets them go home at
night to see their families.
Look, I know I don't have
the greatest beside manner.
But you hired me to take
this company to number one.
Now if you don't want to do
that, I'm probably not your girl.
I was just thinking the same thing.
What happened to you?
The old Carlos would do
anything to be the best.
I guess I'm not the old Carlos anymore.
Fine.
Don't forget your little animals!
Orson, please come upstairs.
I know what that couch
does to your back.
Don't worry about me.
I'll be fine.
Know you're disappointed right now,
but you have to know, I really do want
to find some way for you to be happy.
So do I.
Hey, don't you want your stuff?
Oh, can I get it tomorrow?
I just really want to get home.
Edie?
I always wondered why you were so
determined to live on wisteria lane.
You said you thought we'd be happy
here, and I wanted to believe you.
But it turned out that you...
just wanted to be close to Mike Delfino.
Who gave you that?
Nobody gave it to me.
I did research.
You think I'm too stupid to do research?
Edie, listen. This doesn't mean anything.
It's all there--the accident, Mike's
acquittal, and even a little mention of how...
David Dash couldn't make it to the
funeral because he had a nervous breakdown.
Honey, look.
Just give me a chance to explain.
Oh, so now you want to explain?
Okay, why don't you start by
explaining why you married me?
I married you because I love you.
No!
You married me because
you needed a cover story
so you could get close to the
man who killed your family.
That's ridiculous.
Yeah, it's insane.
But that's why you did it.
So what are you gonna do now?
You gonna hurt him?
I mean...you know, that's the
only. Logical explanation.
And my only question is...
what the hell have you been waiting for?
Honey, you're not feeling well.
Let's get you upstairs into bed.
Tell me the truth, you freak.
Did you move us here
to hurt Mike Delfino?
He destroyed...everything I ever loved,
and he was never punished.
I need to make things right.
Why?
Why did you have to do this?
We could've been so happy.
What are you doing?
I'm gonna tell him before you...
before you do something stupid.
Edie, don't.
Give me that.
No!
Get out of here!
Just get the hell out!
I'm calling the police!
Do you hear me?
Yes, life is full of nasty shocks.
And they always seem occur
when we least expect them.
And once our system has been jolted, the
question becomes, will we survive?
To be continued
So I'm driving my car
the other night,
and what do you think happens?
I crashed into a utility pole.
Then, to add insult to injury,
I was electrocuted.
What can I say?
It was one of those days.
All my neighbors heard it happen.
So they quickly left
their microwaved burritos
and their expensive jars of moisturizer
and their racy pay-per-view movies,
and they hurried outside, excited to
see what all the ruckus was about.
But then, when they saw it was me,
this weird thing happened.
For a moment,
no one moved or said anything.
They just stared. And then...
Oh, my God.
All hell broke loose.
Does anybody know CPR?
There's been an accident.
Edie, can you hear me?
Yes, everyone suddenly
became very concerned,
which was touching,
but ultimately pointless.
Moments before the ambulance finally
arrived, I heard someone whisper...
Don't worry, Edie.
You're going to get through this.
You're going to be just fine.
Oh, Susan Mayer, wrong again.
Two seconds later, it happened.
With all of my neighbors
surrounding me, I took my last breath.
The good news, I died just like I lived,
as the complete
and utter center of attention.
Two days after I kicked
the proverbial bucket,
my husband asked my neighbors
to do me a favor.
You could tell from the looks
on their faces
it wasn't something they wanted to do,
but they agreed to do it anyway.
So the next day, they piled into a car,
with two thermoses filled with coffee,
a basket filled with baked goods,
and an urn that was filled with me.
I hate that we have to do this.
So you've said.
I mean, it really is the kind of thing
a relative should do.
Maybe it is.
But we're in the car, on our way there,
so stop your bitching.
Well, can you at least
put the radio on?
I won't feel like bitching
if I can sing along to something.
If you start singing, I'll start bitching.
And you don't want that.
It's a four-hour drive. We have
to do something to pass the time.
Here's a thought.
Why don't we talk about Edie?
And say what?
I don't know.
But she is the reason we're on this trip.
Maybe we could share memories
or tell stories.
Why don't you start with the time she
tried to steal your comatose boyfriend?
That was fun.
Okay, I was thinking of stories
that put Edie in a positive light.
And after that five minutes is up,
then what do we do?
The woman is dead, people.
Let's honor her memory.
Well, I'm all for saying
a few nice things.
But you were never really friends.
You and Edie clashed
right from the start.
Yeah. That's what everybody thinks.
But the first time we met,
it seemed like we'd end up
being the best of friends.
That's disgusting.
No, it's okay.
It landed on the detergent box.
Here. You go buy yourself
a fresh donut or booze, crack...
Whatever eases the pain.
Just move it along.
You think I'm homeless?
No, no, no. No, I live here.
I... I can prove it.
I know exactly
what's in this garbage bag,
empty carton of eggs,
coffee grinds, shampoo bottle...
Wart removal cream?
You're right. I'm homeless.
Susan Mayer.
It's all cleared up.
Edie Britt.
I just moved in down the street.
Yeah, I saw
the moving van. Welcome.
Thanks.
So is it just you
or do you have a family?
I have a son. He lives with his dad.
It's a long story,
I'll tell you one day over a margarita.
You want to invite me in
for a margarita?
How about coffee? I just put on a pot.
Great. You can fill me in
on all of the neighborhood gossip.
Starting with the redhead across
the street with the muffin basket.
That's a robot, right?
Funny and likes to gossip.
We're going to get along just fine.
Yes, we are.
Wait. Stop.
Could we just rest for a second?
We've only gone four blocks.
Okay, I lied. I hate running.
Well, why didn't you say something?
We've been doing this for a week.
Because we were starting
to become friends.
And you like to run, and I like to sit,
and one of us had to give.
Hi, Susan!
Hi, Helen! Ed!
I would have introduced you,
but once Helen starts talking,
she doesn't shut up.
Right. Ed told me that.
You met Ed?
Yeah.
I've gotten to know him quite well.
Yeah?
We're kind of doing it.
Doing what?
It.
Ed is married.
Yeah, I'm a naughty girl.
No, you're being immoral.
You're committing adultery.
Actually, Ed's committing adultery.
I'm just getting laid.
You know, forget I ever mentioned it.
I can't forget something like this.
Helen is my very good friend.
I thought you just said that she was...
She is annoying, and I hide
when she knocks on my door.
But she does not deserve for you
to be wrecking her marriage.
Where are you going?
Home.
So you're not going
to be my friend anymore?
I don't think so.
I thought you didn't like running!
Well, it depends on
what I'm running away from!
Hi, I'm the whore
that lives down the street.
Could I borrow a cup of condoms?
A cup? Are you sure that'll be enough?
Look, I know that you don't like me.
But I am here to do you a favor anyway.
I was out to dinner last night, and I saw
your husband with another woman.
Really?
I feel bad saying it, but if I were
in your shoes, I would want to know.
You're welcome.
I get it.
So you feel I judged you,
and for revenge, you're trying to
make me insecure about my marriage.
If I wanted revenge, I would
have joined them and had a threesome.
You know, Karl would never cheat.
And the woman he was with,
Brandi, his secretary,
and he took her out for her birthday.
The old "I'm taking my secretary out
for her birthday" routine.
Nice tip of the hat to the classics.
Okay, well since you're on this moral
roll, why don't we walk over to Helen's,
and I will introduce you,
we can have some tea,
and then you two could swap stories
about Ed's favorite positions.
What I do and what Brandi's doing
is completely different.
How?
I'm not looking
to break up anyone's marriage.
I'm in it for a little fun, some free meals,
and to help an unhappy man
through his mid-life crisis.
Wow, you're just a giver.
Fine, use all of your energy judging me,
and ignore the real problem.
But let me tell you something.
This is my area of expertise.
And I saw the look
in that woman's eyes.
She's not in it for the free meals.
She's in it for keeps.
You should leave now.
You know, Susan,
I'm trying to help my neighbor out.
I thought it was the moral thing to do.
Three weeks later, I found Brandi's bra
in Karl's glove compartment
and, well, you know the rest.
Say what you want about Edie,
she really understood men.
I should hope so,
after all those years of research.
I can't help thinking about all the times
Edie and I sniped at each other.
We could have been good friends.
Well, if she knew
what you're about to do for her,
she'd forgive you for everything.
Okay, my hour's up.
Someone else hold Edie now.
I'll take her.
Kind of looks like cat litter.
Lynette! Don't look at Edie.
Or what? I'll turn to stone?
She's all rough and gritty.
Gabby, before we learn
what Edie tastes like...
I've got it.
I think a little more reverence
for the dead is in order.
Please, we're talking about Edie.
A little more irreverence
is what we need. Give it.
Do you guys remember when
you took turns driving me to chemo?
Well,
none of you did it like Edie.
Hey, Lynette.
Hey!
How you feeling?
Same.
Well, here's the DVD you asked for.
Thanks. I'll watch it during chemo,
if I'm not too tired.
Here we go. Hi, Edie.
Hi. What is that?
It's a health shake
of fermented brown rice.
And for her entre, a salad of radish,
burdock root and bok choy.
What's for dessert? Waterboarding?
Thanks. I can't get comfortable.
Could you fluff my pillows?
Of course.
Well, I've got errands to run
and I'll be back to drive you to chemo.
Before you go, would you put my socks
back on? My feet are cold again.
Of course.
Katherine, you have got stuff to do.
Why don't I take her to chemo?
It's fine.
Okay. See you tomorrow, then.
Bye.
Okay, where's your coat?
Why? Chemo's not until 5:00.
Yeah, I've got to make
a little stop on the way.
Edie!
You've been here before?
A couple of times.
You're going to love it. Hey!
Love it? I have cancer.
I probably shouldn't even use
the ladies' room in this place.
There is no ladies' room,
so that's not a problem.
Edie, I have chemo in half an hour.
Fine, then we'd better start drinking.
I'm not supposed to drink.
And they're not supposed
to do tattoos in the kitchen,
but I have a bald eagle on my ass
that says otherwise.
Two tequila shooters!
Hey, Edie!
Reggie! I thought you were in Florida.
No, that was just a body
they identified as me.
Reggie, this is my friend, Lynette.
I'm trying to cheer her up a little.
Right on. Want to shoot some stick?
Uh...
No, thanks.
Come on, you can totally take him.
No, I can't. See? Cancer.
No sweat.
I'll play you one-handed.
Can you excuse us for one second?
Sure.
I need to go to chemo. I have...
Cancer. Yeah, I heard.
And what do you want from me?
I want you to fluff your own pillows.
You need to start fighting this thing.
I'm doing the best I can.
Not even close.
Hell, Lynette, you...
You are the strongest person I know.
You're even stronger than me,
and that's saying something.
Now, I may be a little out of line
bringing you here.
But you need to remember who you are.
Screw cancer. You are Lynette Scavo.
Two tequilas.
Now, where's that
one-armed friend of yours?
I want to shoot some stick.
Wow. It sounds like she gave you
just what you needed. Good for Edie.
She never let me forget it, either.
She always insisted it was the
tequila shooters that killed the cancer.
What the hell is that?
Not now. We have a flat.
Maybe it's a sign
we're not supposed to do this today.
Nice try.
We don't have time for this.
Anybody know how to change a tire?
You want to hand me
that cross wrench?
Do you wanna tell me what that is?
It's the T-shaped dealie
I'm going to whack you with
if you don't hand it over.
You know,
Edie used to live around here
when she moved away
from Wisteria Lane.
You mean
when you gals gave her the boot.
Less yakking, more jacking.
Bree, how did you know
where she lived?
I ran into her once, unexpectedly,
in a place I never thought I'd be.
Bree Hodge?
Follow me. I'll get you situated
and I'll bring your husband in.
Is that the visitors' room?
Yeah. Why?
You don't happen
to have a private room, do you?
You mean, like, an upgrade, something
with a couch and softer lighting?
That would be lovely.
Oh! You were being sarcastic.
Yes, ma'am. Are you ready to...
Not just yet.
It's not a bad idea,
having an upgrade available.
I bet that's a perk
people would be willing to pay for.
Ma'am, it's a prison. The only perk
we offer is a cavity search.
To be honest, I...
I'm not feeling up to this.
I'm going to have to
come back another day.
Fine. He's got another
visitor scheduled anyway,
so I don't even have
to tell him you were here.
Another visitor? Who?
Some lady. She visits him every week.
Every week? What's her name?
I can't give you that.
If she's visiting my husband,
I think I have a right to know.
Ma'am, I'm sorry,
but I cannot give you her name.
Really?
Because I would consider
that a perk worth paying for.
Well, well. What are you doing here?
I wanted to see you.
And you didn't bring muffins?
It isn't that kind of visit.
No muffins and no small talk.
Should I be scared or grateful?
I stopped by the prison today.
The guard tells me
you've been visiting Orson.
Sometimes twice a week, she said.
Who knew lady prison guards
could be so chatty?
What are you up to, Edie?
I'm not up to anything,
you red-headed ice cube.
He's 15 minutes away.
And quite frankly, I feel sorry for him.
After all, I know what it's like
to be exiled from suburbia.
So you're not trying
to start up something?
He's in jail.
My boobs are impressive,
but they can't bend iron bars.
Well, thank you for checking in on him,
and for answering my question.
I have a question.
Why aren't you visiting him?
Well, my schedule is just unreal.
What with the catering company
and looking after Benjamin.
Yeah, well, we're all busy.
Come on.
Why haven't you been to see him?
That jail is... It's disgusting.
All those men in cages, like animals.
Even to step foot in that place
is humiliating.
That man went to jail for you.
Do you have any idea
how much he must love you?
I do.
Then why can't you suck it up
once a month and go and say hi?
Try to help him
get through this living nightmare.
Why can't you do that?
You know, as I think about it,
don't visit him.
He can do so much better than you.
So how are you doing?
How do you think?
You're right. I shouldn't have asked.
I know it's horrible here.
How would you know?
You've never been.
You have every right to hate me.
There's no need to be melodramatic.
I meant for asking you to come here,
for insisting you turn yourself in.
Now that I see this place,
I don't know what I was thinking.
You were thinking I needed
to take responsibility for what I did,
and you were right.
But, still, asking you
to make this sacrifice
and not ever coming to see you.
How can you ever forgive me?
Just be there when I get out.
I never told you about that,
because I was embarrassed.
Yeah, Edie Britt shamed you
into being a better human being.
That is embarrassing.
All right, ladies. We're ready to ride.
Good, we've got some ground
to make up.
I was hoping we would be
able to get there before dark.
How do you think
he'll react when we tell him?
How do you think?
I never thought Edie
would be cremated.
I figured she'd want to be pumped
full of chemicals and preserved.
Isn't that what she did
for the last 15 years?
My theory, Edie knew if she was buried,
her true date of birth would be carved
into a tombstone for all the world to see.
You really think she spent
a lot of time thinking about her death?
Yeah, I do.
I spent a night with her
right after Carlos and I got divorced.
Is this too red?
I think I need something pinker.
It's fine.
Hurry up, I want to get to the club
while this bikini wax is still fresh.
This is going to be fun.
I can't believe we've never
gone out on the town together!
Well, we've never
been single together before.
I feel so sorry
for all those other girls in the bar.
So do I.
To be fair,
we should probably walk in backwards.
Oh, no, that won't work.
We're an unstoppable team.
The hottest chicks on Wisteria Lane.
Oh, be nice. There are lots
of attractive women on this street.
Like who?
How about Bree?
With that hair color,
you could stick a red nose on her
and she could join the circus.
Lynette's beautiful.
For a baby factory.
And Susan?
We're the hottest, okay?
Wow.
Too much?
No. It's great.
All right, come on let's go.
Wow, you were right about this place.
Told you.
A lot of hotties, very few notties.
Ladies, this is from the gentleman
at the end of the bar.
And I just sat down.
Well, that's a personal best.
Actually, the drink's for her.
Well, it's pretty dark in here.
He probably didn't
get a good look at me.
Edie, don't take it personally.
We're just different types.
You're right. Some like tall, blond
and sexy, and some men like that.
Now, now, Edie, don't be snarky.
We're both hot, remember?
Although, apparently,
I'm just a little bit hotter.
Well, one guy might think so.
One guy who is evidently intimidated
by full-sized, womanly breasts.
Yes, I guess
I am a little on the small side.
That's the drawback
to having ones that are real.
What are you talking about?
These are real!
Edie, come on.
When you jump up and down,
the room moves more than your boobs.
Well, someone obviously
has a chip on her shoulder.
I'd reach down and knock it off,
but I can't go down that low.
Okay, you really think
you're hotter than me?
Let's just say that
I have more of what men want.
Yeah? Well, I have a vodka soda here
that says otherwise.
So he bought you
one drink.
A well drink, I might add.
Well, it's one more than you got.
Are you saying that I can't get a man
to buy me a cocktail?
Sure you can. Just not as many as me.
One hour.
Whoever gets the most swizzle sticks
by the end wins.
See you in an hour, loser.
I know what boys like
We know what guys want
I know what boys like
We know what's in their mind
I make them want me
I like to tease them
They want to touch me
I never let them
I know what boys like
We know what guys want
I know what boys like
Boys like, boys like me
Sucker
I know what boys like
We know what guys want
Count them and weep, Solis.
Well, I guess I could do that.
Or I could do this.
I should make some kind of speech.
But I think it's enough
we both know I crushed you, right?
Now if you'll excuse me, swizzle stick
number 17 has a yacht and giant feet.
What the hell were you thinking,
abandoning me at a singles bar?
I'm sorry, I just needed
to be by myself for a while.
Why? Don't tell me you're depressed
because you lost some stupid game.
I'm not depressed. I'm surprised.
It's going by so quickly.
What is?
My youth.
The harder I try to hold onto it,
the more it just slips
through my fingers.
And all the makeup and dim lighting
in the world can't seem to stop it.
Please. You're gorgeous.
And you are going
to stay that way forever.
That's the tricky part.
I'm not going to be old.
What?
Ever since I was a child, I've known
that I was never going to see 50.
That's ridiculous.
No, it's true.
As far back as I can remember,
a voice in my head said,
"Live it up today, 'cause you're
not going to have a lot of tomorrows."
You do realize there's medication
designed to get rid of those voices?
It's not a bad thing, Gabby.
It's actually a gift.
I appreciate my life
in a way that most people don't.
I just didn't expect it
to go by this fast, that's all.
You know what?
I have a voice inside my head
that says you're wrong.
It tells me that 50 years from now,
you and I will still be wearing dresses
too tight and walking in heels too high
and going to bars
where we'll meet old geezers
who'll buy us drinks with the last
of their social security checks.
If you say so.
Now come on, let's go to my house.
Let's pop open a bottle of wine
and toast to our future.
Why not?
Isn't that weird?
She knew she was going to die young.
What do you mean you two were
the hottest chicks on the lane?
She called me a "baby factory"?
Yeah, Gabby, in hindsight,
maybe you shouldn't have told
that part of the story.
I think we're here.
So are we ready for this?
I don't know.
Can you ever be ready to tell a boy
that his mother is dead?
Hey, Travers.
Remember us?
Sure. Wow, you brought
the whole neighborhood with you.
Did my mom come with you?
We brought you some muffins.
You can share them
with your roommates.
Or maybe a favorite teacher.
What's going on?
Is my mom in trouble or something?
Come here.
I'm afraid we have some bad news.
Your mom was in
a very serious accident,
and I am so sorry,
but she passed away.
She died?
When?
A couple of days ago.
We've been trying
to get in touch with your dad,
but he's still out of the country.
And your mom's new husband's
never met you,
so he thought
it would be best if we told you.
Wow.
If you'd like,
we could give you a moment.
No.
I'm okay.
Well, I have a class.
I'm sure the school will understand
if you need to miss a few days.
I don't need to do that.
I mean, I'm sorry she's dead,
but we weren't very close.
Still, she was your mother.
Technically. But not a very good one.
Look, Travers, we're all moms here.
We've all made mistakes with our kids.
And what we count on is
when they grow up, they'll forgive us.
My mom didn't even try to raise me.
I mean, she just handed me
to my father and walked away.
How do you expect me to forgive that?
Look, I'm sorry, I don't mean to be rude,
but I'm going to be late.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, wait a second!
Travers, you need to know
something about your mom,
and I'm gonna tell you. Now sit down.
I'd only known
your mom about a year
when she came over to my house
this one day.
Hey, Karen, your porch light's on.
Whoa. Sitting in your bathrobe
drinking, and you didn't call me?
I kind of wanted to be alone.
Why?
It's the anniversary of my son's death.
I'm sorry.
Every year, I think it'll get easier.
And it never does.
Nothing worse than losing a child.
In a way, you're kind of lucky
you don't have any.
Actually, I do.
What?
I have a son.
You lived here a year.
How do I not know this?
Because he lives with his father.
When I got divorced,
I gave him full custody.
So I kind of know how you feel.
I mean, we both lost kids.
No.
I lost a kid. You gave yours away.
And you have the nerve to tell me
you know how I feel?
I gave him up
because I wanted to protect him.
From who?
From me!
You know, I tried to be a good mom,
I really did.
But I know myself.
And if he...
If he was going to grow up normal,
he needed to get away from me.
What a cop-out.
I think you're just being selfish.
You know, trust me, Karen,
there is nothing that you could say
to make me think less about myself
than I already do.
But if it gives him a chance, it's worth it.
Aren't you afraid
he's going to hate you?
I love him enough to let him hate me.
Well, I hope you're not
making a big mistake.
Me, too.
So I'm not defending
everything she did, Travers.
But you have to know, she loved you,
more than you can imagine.
I really need to get to class.
I believe I called shotgun.
God, she is so good at that.
She should be. She's been doing it
since she rode shotgun
on an actual stagecoach.
Hey, hey.
I realized I never thanked you
for coming all the way out here
just to tell me.
That was really cool of you.
We felt we owed it to your mom.
Oh, my God! I can't believe we forgot.
What?
We also came to give you
your mom's ashes.
We thought you might want
to scatter them somewhere.
Unless that's a little weird for you.
Why don't you guys take them?
Are you sure?
Yeah.
You were her best friends.
I'm sure you could think
of the perfect place to put her.
Okay, we're here.
Guys. Wake up. Guys?
We're home. Get out.
Lord, Lynette,
you nearly gave me a heart attack!
Yeah, I'd like to see Edie again,
but not tonight.
I think my leg's asleep.
Actually, that's my leg.
Get your hand off.
Lynette, thank you again for driving.
You bet.
Hold it!
We've still got to figure out
where we're going to spread the ashes.
Now, it's got to be someplace
that was meaningful to Edie.
Well, Edie once told me
she lost her virginity in a cow pasture.
If we can find that exact field...
We'd find a lot of traumatized cows.
Do we really need to do this tonight?
They're ashes.
It's not like they're going to go bad.
Fine. We'll talk tomorrow.
Oh, Edie.
What are we going to do with you?
Subtle as always, I see.
This was a wonderful idea, Karen.
Wasn't exactly mine.
Now be careful, you're spilling Edie.
Urn is empty. Let's do it.
Shouldn't we say something first?
Like what?
I don't know.
A few words describing
how we felt about her?
I don't think
Edie would want us to get all sappy.
Well, I think if we're quick about it,
she'd be fine.
Here's a thought, we all say one word
that sums up what we thought of her.
And then we dump her?
Then we dump her.
Just one word? This is hard.
Hmm.
Okay, I've got one, I'll go first.
Edie Britt was sexy.
Perceptive.
Strong.
Beautiful.
I need four words.
God.
Okay, I want to do Edie justice,
and for that to happen,
I need four words. Okay?
Edie would so not be surprised
you're ruining this moment.
Go ahead, Susan.
What are your four words for Edie?
One of a kind.
Now, it's time.
And that is how Wisteria Lane
came to be my final resting place.
My ashes were spread over grass
I had once walked on,
beneath trees that
had once given me shade,
on top of roses I once admired,
and beside fences
I once gossiped over.
And after my friends
had finished saying goodbye,
a wind came along and took
what was left of me into the air.
As I looked down on the world,
I began to let go of it.
I let go of white picket fences
and cars in driveways,
coffee cups and vacuum cleaners...
I let go of all those things
which seem so ordinary,
but when you put them together,
they make up a life.
A life that really was one of a kind.
I'll tell you something, it's not hard
to die when you know you have lived.
And I did. Oh, how I lived.
Previously on Desperate Housewives.
Lynette went back to work.
And Tom filled his days.
You're good at this girl talk thing.
Well, thanks.
Do you at least know why he steals?
I steal to hurt you.
Bree struggled
to understand her husband's problem,
while down the street, Edie finally
figured out her husband's plan.
You married me so you could get close
to the man who killed your family.
He was never punished.
Rose Kemper
was a survivor.
You could see that
by looking into her eyes.
She had buried one husband,
given birth to five children,
survived illness, bankruptcy,
even the loss of her teeth.
As a result, Rose Kemper was
no longer afraid of anything.
Sadly, the man who climbed
into her window that night
was unaware of this.
But Rose was more than happy
to explain it to him.
Get out of here!
You just get the hell out!
I'm calling the police! Do you hear me?
Mrs. Kemper?
Katherine, what are you doing here?
Oh, I heard you weren't feeling well,
so I brought you some flowers.
Doctors tell me you had
a mild heart attack.
Did they tell you why?
It was Death. He came for me.
Death came for you?
But I chased him out
with my baseball bat.
I gave him a good whack, too.
Right on the old noggin.
How much morphine
do they have you on?
You know that shelf where I keep
my knickknacks? He tried to take one.
Death collects knickknacks?
And when he couldn't get me,
he went after that other lady,
the one who crashed.
Edie Britt?
Oh, yes. And I saw everything.
Death just staggered out into the street,
and he raised his hands,
and he made her
run into that light pole.
Katherine, you believe me, don't you?
Oh, I would never make
anything like this up.
I know you wouldn't, sweetheart.
Listen, I'll stop by tomorrow.
You just get your rest. Okay?
But, Katherine,
if you see Death lurking in the hall,
you tell him
he'd better not come around here.
Because I am not afraid of him.
No, Rose Kemper
was not afraid of anything.
But the man who had
broken into her home
was now very afraid of Rose Kemper.
The fact is, everyone does it.
Sometimes with the help
of an overturned cushion,
sometimes by means
of a large potted plant.
Other times,
using the top button of a shirt.
Yes, everyone has something
they want to keep hidden
from prying eyes.
It's hard to believe you got this bump
just by falling.
But some people
are better at cover-ups than others.
I know, but that's what happened.
And I went for a walk, I tripped,
and I hit my head on the curb.
Okay. Well,
everything's looking much better.
I see no reason why he shouldn't
be released this weekend.
Really? That soon?
You can pick him up in the afternoon.
Orson, I'll check in one more time
before you go.
Thank you.
Well, you don't seem all that thrilled
about the prospect of me coming home.
Honey, I don't mean to be negative.
It's just...
What's going to happen?
Will you keep stealing and lying to me?
I love you, but I just can't
put up with that anymore.
Don't worry.
Things are going to be different.
How?
Well, I've been doing
a lot of thinking lately
and I've decided, finally, to be happy.
How can you just decide
something like that?
Look, there are things that
I don't like about my life.
But there is so much that is good.
Do I really want to risk
losing everything?
I mean, if I can decide to be
resentful and jealous,
I can damn well decide to be happy.
And be the kind of husband
that you deserve.
Do you really mean that?
I do.
I hope so, because I just cannot
take any more lying.
You won't have to.
I can promise you that.
Dave?
Hello?
Dave?
He didn't answer.
Okay, now I'm starting to get worried.
Yeah, I left that casserole
three days ago and it's still there.
I'm surprised the squirrels
haven't gotten to it.
Maybe they did. Anybody seen
any dead squirrels around here?
Even if Dave wants to be alone,
we have to make sure
he's taken care of.
We owe it to Edie.
I say we keep showing up here
until he lets us help him.
We need to be annoying
and persistent. We're good at that.
So who can come by later
and check on him?
I'd do it, but I'm working late.
I'm in the classroom all day,
and I have meetings after.
I have rehearsal dinner to cater.
And I have
a garden club meeting.
You're in a garden club?
Yeah, I just joined.
Wait, there wouldn't happen to be
actual gardeners in this club,
would there?
Hot, shirtless gardeners
with great abs and learner's permits?
Gee, this bit just gets funnier
and funnier.
Oh, we tease because we love.
Now back to Dave.
I'll ask Mike to check in on him.
That'd be great.
Remember to tell him,
annoying and persistent.
And I can make another casserole.
Yeah, because he
hasn't suffered enough.
That's a bit
that I never get tired of.
Dave? Hello, it's Mike.
Dave?
Dave?
Hey, I'm sorry to barge in.
I just want to make sure you're okay.
Katherine made you lasagna.
Thought it would be a good idea
to eat something.
Want me to get you a plate?
I'm good.
You'll get through this, buddy. You will.
Look, I have gone through some...
You've gone through nothing.
And if you stand there and try to tell me
you understand how I feel,
I swear to God,
I'm going to lose my mind.
Man, I'm just trying to help.
You can't! Okay?
So why don't you go back to Katherine
and your happy little life
and leave me the hell alone?
You're right. I don't have any idea
what you're going through.
Sweetie, I'm home!
Hey.
Hey.
Don't make plans on Tuesday.
We're having dinner at the Solis' and...
What's that look on your face?
You didn't eat dairy again, did you?
No! I've been working out.
If you're good, I'll let you cop a feel.
That's okay. I can see it from here.
It's thrilling.
You smell good.
I just took a shower.
And I know where you're going
with this, but I'm exhausted.
Come on, Lynette. Please?
Whining, that's hot.
Fine. Let's have sex.
But I warn you,
I'm just going to lie here,
resenting you the whole time,
waiting for this hell to be over.
Okay, if you're sure.
Tom! Come on!
Fine. All right. Okay, forget it.
Wait, you just took a shower? Where?
At work.
I didn't know you had a shower there.
I don't. Carlos does.
So you went into Carlos's office,
stripped naked and took a shower?
No, I went into Carlos's bathroom,
closed the door,
then stripped naked and took a shower.
I'm not comfortable with this.
What if he walked in?
Then maybe I'd get that raise
I've been asking for.
This isn't funny. You already spend
16 hours a day with the guy.
And now I find out that some of those
hours, you are naked and wet.
Hours? It was two minutes.
It's not like I'm lighting candles
and putting on Barry White.
I don't care. I want it to stop.
Fine.
I should've just had sex,
I'd be asleep by now.
Oh, and ladies, we have been asked
by the city council
to beautify the center divider
on Main Street.
So make sure your calendars
are clear next Tuesday.
I know I'm new here at the garden club,
but what's with all the gardening?
I thought this was just an excuse to
get together for bitching and boozing.
Blame Edna, the flower fascist.
Yeah, when we first joined,
we used to sit around in wicker chairs,
drinking margaritas
and just looked at the flowers.
Oh, I'd kill for a margarita.
Don't cluster, ladies. Vary the colors.
And she's the one I'd kill. I mean,
really, who died and left her in charge?
Alice Koontz.
Grand mal seizure while driving.
Oh.
Well, this Edna has got to be stopped.
How?
Oh, my God, you're planning a coup,
aren't you? I'm in.
Me, too.
That's three. Who else can we get?
Definitely Judy,
and Terry's allergic to everything.
One bee sting and she blows up like...
Well, like Judy.
How about the woman in the overalls?
Oh, Phyllis?
She just got her second DUI.
Lf there's cocktails, she's in.
Yeah.
Okay, so the lush gives us six.
What about them?
No way.
They're all friends of Edna's.
All right, so they have six
and we have six.
We're going to need a tie-breaker.
Hey, are men allowed to join the group?
I don't know why they wouldn't be.
Ladies, start your blenders.
Orson, I heard you wanted to see me.
Yes, Dr. Kagen.
I heard you're treating
the lady across the hall.
You mean Rose Kemper?
Yeah, she's actually my neighbor.
I wanted to know how she's doing.
Sorry, I can't discuss her condition
with anyone she's not related to.
Oh, that's a problem.
See, she has no family,
or friends for that matter.
And because of her dementia...
Who said she has dementia?
Well, certainly you've heard
some of her bizarre ramblings.
If she doesn't have dementia,
it's something just as troubling.
She has been saying
some very disturbing things.
But I wasn't aware
it was an ongoing situation.
Oh, yes, it is.
And I'm so worried about her
going back to that big house
with no one to look after her.
I hate to get Social Services involved.
They'd probably just stick her
in some state-run facility.
Oh, well, that would be a shame.
But what if she ends up hurting herself,
or someone else?
I mean, I'm no lawyer,
but wouldn't the hospital be liable?
Hey, Penny.
Aren't you going to be late for school?
My stupid brothers hid my homework.
Real mature.
Is your mom ready?
She's in the shower.
What?
Lynette!
Carlos, you're early!
Didn't you get my text?
The meeting got moved up!
Oh, crap. I'll be right there!
Lynette, you okay?
Lynette?
Are you all right?
If you don't answer me,
I'm coming in there!
Oh, my God.
All right, Doctor. Thank you. Bye.
He says that since you weren't out
very long, you should be fine.
And don't worry about the meeting,
I pushed it to lunch.
And I can handle it alone.
No, I'm fine, I want to go.
You sure?
Okay, I'll let you get dressed.
Hey, Carlos, quick question for you.
Last thing I remember,
I was in the shower, naked,
reaching for the soap.
Then I was here on the bed,
under a blanket,
still naked.
And my question is,
how did I get from there to here?
Well, I carried you.
Which means you saw me...
Lynette, the only thing
I was thinking about was,
were you going to be all right?
Oh, well, I appreciate that.
And here's something else
I'd appreciate,
could we not tell anyone else
about this?
Not tell anyone? I'm a first-time hero!
This was going to be my lead item
in this year's Christmas letter.
If Tom finds out, he'll freak.
He has this weird thing about being
the only guy who gets to see me naked.
You got it. Now get dressed.
We've got to go.
Could you maybe step outside?
I only do one show a day.
Sorry.
Here you go!
Edna, here's your diet soda.
Try to keep your pants on.
You know, I don't mean to be a killjoy,
but are we going to do
any planting today?
There are some seeds in this.
Knock yourself out.
Patty, do you mind
if I steal Tom for a sec?
Okay. But only a sec.
Okay.
What's up?
First of all, you're a real prince
for coming today.
Thanks to you, our coup is complete.
No problem.
Anyway,
I know you must be bored silly.
So go ahead and make your escape.
Actually, I'm thinking of staying.
I'm having a great time.
Meeting some nice people.
Yeah, about that. I've got to warn you.
Patty's kind of got a thing
for married men.
Oh, Patty? No. No, no.
She's just being nice.
Yes, she's like that.
She'll give you the bra off her back.
We're just talking.
"Oh, Tom. What big arms you have."
That kind of talking?
Oh, that. Okay, fine. Fine. Point taken.
Okay, great. Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have to get back to my gardening.
So Orson's "decided to be happy"?
Isn't that great.
He sounded very sincere.
I'll bet.
So just how happy is he going to be?
Will he whistle while he works,
or will he just skip
around the house occasionally?
I did not raise you to be bitchy.
No, you raised me to
be passive-aggressive.
My bitchiness, that was self-taught.
Well, save it for those karaoke parties
at Bob and Lee's. I am not amused.
Mom, your BS meter might be broken,
but mine works just fine.
Orson's up to something.
Well, I can understand
why you're a bit cynical,
but I'm giving him another chance.
He's my husband and I still love him.
He's been stealing stuff
from your friends.
He tried to get you
to sell your business.
I know.
Fine. Go ahead. Take him back.
But while you're watching Orson
skip and sing,
I'll be looking up divorce lawyers.
Just in case.
Susan? You here?
In the kitchen!
Why are you mopping the ceiling?
I was cooking, all right?
Lids, Susan.
You've really got to start using lids.
Sometimes it's the stove's fault.
So I saw Dave last night.
How'd that go?
Not good.
He's in a really dark place.
He kind of lashed out at me.
At you? Why?
I don't know. It's like all of a sudden
he resents my happiness
with Katherine.
That's weird.
Maybe not.
When your wife dies,
it must be depressing to see
other people in a loving relationship.
Hey, maybe you could look in on him.
Yeah, yeah, that didn't come out right.
I know what you meant.
I'll stop by tomorrow and see him.
Thanks.
You know, this whole thing with Edie.
I mean, seeing her lying in the street
that night.
It just brought up all those awful
memories from our accident.
Susan,
we did what we had to do.
Yeah.
Look what it did to us.
Daddy!
Hey, buddy. Hey, you hungry?
No. Mommy made spaghetti.
Well, I'll have him back before school.
You take care.
You, too.
Hey, I'm on my way to work,
but I just wanted to bring you these.
Chicken salad sandwiches,
which I did not make, I bought.
I learned my lesson from the casserole.
Thanks.
Wait. Could you
maybe have one right now?
So that I know
that you actually ate something.
I'm not hungry. But, again, thanks.
Dave, I know that
you're going through hell.
But Edie was my friend, so, please,
let me help you. Just a little.
You sure you don't want one?
It's really good.
Still not hungry.
So have you thought about
what you're going to do now?
I'm going to sell the house.
You're kidding. So soon?
I've got a realtor coming by today.
I'm going to put the money
in a trust for Travers.
It's what Edie would have wanted.
Okay, well...
At least you're making plans
for the future.
Everything that ever mattered to me
is gone.
The future's the last thing
I'm thinking about.
Well, I should probably put these
away before I finish them off.
Are you sure there's nothing I can do
to help you? A load of laundry?
No, thanks.
How about a pot of coffee?
Or I could just straighten up in here.
Susan, please. I need to be alone.
Oh...
Okay.
Sure.
Do you know what is a great cure
for the blues? Cribbage.
Do you have a cribbage set?
I thought you had to go to work.
I'll call in sick, take the day off.
Susan. I really don't want to be rude,
but you need to leave.
Okay. You have a realtor coming, right?
You cannot let him see the house
in this condition.
So just let me clean up a little.
You won't even know I'm here.
All right. I will be back after work
to check on you.
But until then, here's the phone
in case you want to order Chinese
or call a hotline or something.
Hey, Katherine, can you call me back
as soon as you can?
I just left Dave and he's in bad shape.
I actually think that he might be...
Oh, crap. I've got to go.
Yes, Officer?
License and registration, please.
Okay. What did I do?
It's against the law
to talk on a cell phone
without using a hands-free device
while driving, as of January 1 st.
Right. I know that! I just was worried
about a friend, so I forgot. I'm sorry.
Step out of the car, slowly.
What? You don't want the license?
Out of the car.
You think that I'm dangerous.
No, I totally have an explanation
for those.
Stop talking.
But you're going to feel really silly
when you hear what it is.
Get out of the car now!
Okay.
On the ground!
Oh, yes, sir! Okay.
Hey, Susan,
I just got your message about Dave.
I'm on my way to the hospital,
but if you want me to...
I... You know, why don't we talk later?
Hey! Tom.
Hey.
Was that Patty Rizzo?
Yeah.
I had some car trouble,
so she followed me over to the garage
and gave me a lift back.
Patty lives six blocks away.
I live down the street.
Why didn't you ask me to take you?
Are you going somewhere with this?
All right, look, Tom, I'm sorry,
but I've got a responsibility here.
I brought you into the club, I introduced
you to the horny homemaker.
I just don't want you to...
What, Gabby? Cheat on my wife?
I was going to say "die of gonorrhea,"
but that's close enough.
Okay, I really appreciate your concern,
but how can I put this? Butt out.
All right, Tom, you leave me no choice.
You are no longer allowed to see Patty.
"Allowed"? Who are you? My mother?
I trump your mother.
I am Garden Club President.
This is ridiculous.
I thought you were my friend.
Look, I love you, Tom,
but you're my friend with a small "F."
My friend with the big "F" is Lynette.
So if I see something
that could hurt her,
you bet your ass
I'm going to do something about it.
A neighbor offered me a ride.
If you want to hurt Lynette
and twist it into something that it isn't,
screw you.
And that's with a big "F."
Hello, my love.
Hello, darling.
Please tell me you're here to spring me.
Not that I haven't enjoyed every
moment of your poking and prodding.
I'm just taking one last look
at your husband.
Are you sure he wasn't
in some sort of bar fight?
Looks like he got smacked over
the head with a pool cue or something.
Orson's not exactly the "bar fight" type.
He's more of a "raised voices
at a cheese tasting" type.
While I'm finishing up here,
do you want to go
sign the discharge papers?
Great. Be back in a minute.
Bree?
Katherine, hi, what are you doing here?
Oh, I came to see Rose Kemper.
Oh, right, I heard she was here.
Yeah, it's so sad.
I'm here to help her pack.
Social Services is coming
this afternoon
to take her to some nursing home.
I'm surprised.
I knew she was a bit dotty,
but I didn't think it was that serious.
Oh, yes. She's been telling people
this story about how
Death broke into her house.
Death? Oh, dear.
Apparently he climbed in
through a window
and then tried to steal
one of her knickknacks.
Oh, well, that's odd.
Yeah.
Then she whacked him across the head
with a baseball bat.
A bat?
Which is what I would do
if Death were
to ever steal one of my knickknacks.
So did she get
a good look at Death?
No, she said he was
wearing some sort of mask.
She tells the story so convincingly,
you almost believe her.
Oh, there's the social worker. I want to
be there when she talks to Rose.
He's all yours, Bree.
Wonderful.
This dinner is delicious.
You really didn't have to do this.
With the long hours
that you've been putting in,
I just wanted to do something special
to say thank you.
And by "do something,"
he means having me slave over
a rack of lamb all day.
I would like to propose a toast.
Who says that friendship
and business don't mix? To friendship.
Hear, hear, to friendship.
So I want to hear more
about the garden club.
Tom says he's meeting
all kinds of nice people.
Really? Any favorites, Tom?
They're all great gals.
One's sort of a pain in the ass.
Other than her, I'm having a great time.
Although, I keep telling Tom
how dangerous gardens can be.
Everywhere you step,
there are shovels and rakes and hoes.
You know, Lynette and I should
really be toasting you two.
Us?
Yeah.
For putting up with all the long hours
we've been keeping.
Hey, I didn't mind the long hours.
Wasn't so crazy
about the whole shower thing, but...
Oh, so Lynette told you about that?
Yeah.
She thought I was nuts
for getting weird about it.
I get it. You know, a guy carries your
unconscious, naked wife to your bed...
What are you talking about?
Hey, is this gorgonzola?
The other day, when she fell in your
shower. What are you talking about?
When she took a shower in your office.
You took a shower in my office?
What's going on here?
Lynette was taking a shower and
Carlos came by to drive her to work,
she slipped and fell, and he helped her.
You told her? I asked you not to.
She's my wife. I tell her everything.
Oh, you hear that, Lynette?
They tell each other everything.
That way they know that
they're not hiding anything.
I was just afraid you'd overreact.
Like you're doing right now.
Full disclosure, Lynette.
That's what a marriage is about.
So I assume you fully disclosed
your little "friendship" with Patty Rizzo?
What little friendship?
You know what?
I think this is gorgonzola.
Tom?
What?
Patty gave me a ride home,
and for some reason
Gabby's making a big deal about it.
Because it's Patty Rizzo!
She's a total slut.
You should be on antibiotics
just for sitting in her car.
Exactly.
Stay out of this, Gabby.
You've done enough damage.
Hey, don't snap at me.
Lynette's my friend.
I was just watching her back.
While your husband
was watching her front.
Drop it, Tom.
We'll continue this at home.
If you have a shower at the office, how
come you come home smelling so bad?
I don't know.
Why does the lamb taste like sawdust?
Thank you, darling.
I can't tell you how nice it is
to be home again.
Well, it's wonderful to have you home.
How's your head?
Still hurts.
Well, that'll teach you
to go out walking
in the middle of the night.
You know, I still don't know
why you were out so late.
Well, I told you. We had a little spat,
and I wanted to clear my head.
And then you bumped it
on that nasty curb.
Well, that will teach me to fight
with my lovely wife.
And that's all you were doing,
just going out for a walk?
That's all.
You know, I just remembered some
business I have to discuss with Andrew.
Enjoy your tea.
Hey, Mom. What's wrong?
Orson's lying to me again.
So I think I have to divorce him.
Just tell me how I can help.
You okay?
Oh, I just keep thinking about Dave.
How his life was so great,
he had everything.
Then one day, boom, all gone.
Yeah, I know.
Life can turn on a dime.
Dave, Edie, Rose Kemper.
The one thing it's made me realize is,
I don't want to live with regrets.
Me neither.
I've been wanting to tell you this
for some time.
Remember when I suggested
moving in together?
It wasn't just about saving rent.
I was trying to pull you closer,
manipulate some kind of commitment
out of you.
And that's not who I am,
so I want you to know
that I'm sorry
and it won't happen again.
From now on, no hidden agendas.
I like that policy.
I'm always going to be honest with you.
After all, you're the guy I'm going
to spend the rest of my life with.
More sandwiches.
Or is my gun in there?
It's just your belts and ties.
The police kept the rest.
I know. They called.
You told them I was suicidal.
I'm sorry. It's just the things you said...
I'm worried about you.
Don't be. I told you, I'm fine.
You are not fine. How could you be?
You have suffered a horrible loss.
And you are allowed
to feel any way you want.
But I know that you are not fine.
Okay, well, I'm sorry for ransacking
your house. I'll stop bugging you.
Edie and I had a fight that night.
A bad one.
I came home, we argued.
She stormed out,
got in her car and died.
Oh, Dave.
That does not make it your fault.
Doesn't it?
If things had been different,
if I had been different,
she'd still be alive.
You can't think that way.
I mean, what happened is bad enough.
You can't blame yourself for it, too.
If you do that, you will destroy
everything you have left that's good.
Trust me, I know.
Trust me. You don't.
A few years ago,
Mike and I got in a car accident.
A woman and her daughter died.
Yeah, I heard about that.
Mike was driving, right?
That's what we said.
But it wasn't true.
After the crash,
I couldn't find my license.
I had switched purses that night
and I left it at home,
and so Mike
told them that he was driving.
He took the blame for me.
So I understand guilt.
And I want you to understand that
Edie's death was an awful tragedy.
It was not your fault.
Maybe you're right.
Thank you for telling me.
Heck of a dinner party, huh?
It's amazing how fast you can eat
in total silence.
It's my fault.
I should have just told Tom the truth.
Although, it turned out to
be kind of a wash
with the whole Patty Rizzo thing.
You know what I think is cool?
You guys have been married
a long time and you still get jealous.
Yeah.
But just to be on the safe side,
if I fall in my tub again, let me die there.
Okay, back to work.
Yes,
and we shall never speak of this again.
I am embarrassed enough.
Lynette,
I saw you without your towel.
You've got nothing
to be embarrassed about.
Hey.
Hey.
How was the garden club today?
Oh, Phyllis got tanked on cosmos
and threw up on Edna.
So now we're back to planting crap.
Look, I'm really sorry for sticking my
nose into that whole Patty Rizzo thing.
It's okay, I...
The truth is,
I knew she was coming on to me.
Then why did you keep
hanging out with her?
Lynette has been so swamped
with work lately that she doesn't...
It's just nice having a woman
notice me again.
Is that terrible?
No, I get it.
When we first moved here,
Carlos was working around the clock,
and he'd come home
and barely say hello to me.
It was like I was invisible.
Invisible.
That's the word.
So when he didn't see me,
I found someone who did.
You know I'd never do that to Lynette.
I never thought I'd do it to Carlos.
Well, then it's a good thing I've got
a friend around to keep an eye on me.
Even if it's one with a small "F."
Well, for the record,
you're growing on me.
You know what? I'm thirsty.
Let's start a book club.
The fact is,
everyone does it.
Everyone tries to cover up
what they don't want others to see.
Women hide their need
for commitment.
Men disguise their growing insecurity.
Wives mask their intense disdain.
How can ordinary people
hide the truth of their feelings
so successfully?
All it takes is a friendly gesture...
You can't play in the street, MJ.
You could get hurt. And that would
really tear your mom apart.
And a plan.
previously on...
does this relationship have a future?
Can't we just keep going the way we are?
Jackson left.
Orson's lying to magain.
Bree made a decision.
So I think I have to divorce him.
Karl signed up.
Karl, what are you doing here?
Well, I just enrolled evan.
And susan confessed.
Mike and I got in a car accident.
Mike was driving, right?
That's what we said, but it wasn't true.
He took the blame for me.
on this street, the
bargaining begins at sunrise...
an old woman offers a paperboy a generous
tip if he'll throw the paper onto her porch...
a wife tells her husband she'll make his
favorite dinner if he'll bring home roses...
a man tells his neighbor he'll take in his
garbage cans the day she finally mows her lawn.
Yes, on wisteria lane,
everyone knows how to bargain--
absolutely everyone.
I don't want oatmeal.
Can I have pancakes?
Katherine's not a
short order cook, buddy.
If she made oatmeal for
breakfast, we're having oatmeal.
I tell you what, M.J.
If you finish just half of it, I will
make candied apples for your sleepover.
I love candy apples.
She's letting you off
easy. You should thank her.
Thank you, katherine.
You are so welcome, you sweet thing.
Dad, are you gonna marry katherine?
that's, um... I don't know.
Why not?
Oh, well, oh, because we
haven't talked about marriage.
Why not?
M.J., You're being rude.
Oh, I'm not offended.
Don't you wanna marry katherine?
well... I love her. She's
absolutely fantastic.
So why don't you marry her?
Can you help me out here?
Are you kidding?
Buddy, um, when it comes
to marriage, the truth is...
Would you look at the
time? I'm late for work.
we're gonna have to
talk about this later.
Coward.
You got that right.
How'd I do?
You were great.
But he didn't answer me.
Doesn't matter. Issue's on the table.
Yes, on this street, the negotiating
begins at sunrise, and it doesn't end...
here's the ice cream I promised you.
Until someone gets
exactly what they want.

Desperate
Housewives Season05 Episode21</font>
Walter bergen was a divorce lawyer,
and the women who hired him always had something
to say about the men they were divorcing.
He's always talking to his
grandmother, who died six years ago.
He spends all his money on hookers,
who may or may not be women.
He says he needs more money for the children,
and by "children," I mean racehorses.
Yes, walter bergen
thought he had heard it all
until the day when one ofis
clients actually said...
my husband is a decent man,
and I want to do right by him.
Women who seek my services
rarely take that attitude.
Well, I like to think of
myself as a good person.
I'm sure you are.
And I wouldn't worry about your husband.
The income he'll derive from his half
of the catering business alone should--
wait.I'm not planning
on giving him half.
It's my business.
Which you started
after you were married.
That entitles him to half.
I-I may have overstated things when I
described my husband as a decent man.
He actually has a wide variety
of psychological problems.
Mrs. Hodge, it's state law.
What do you want me to say?
I want you to say that for $300 an hour,
you have some lawyer tricks up your
sleeve to help me protect my business.
Surely you're not asking
me to do something criminal?
Mrs. Hodge, didn't you say you like
to think of yourself as a good person?
Well, clearly, I like to think of
myself as a rich person even more.
Full house. Bree takes the
high. Gaby gets the low.
Split the pot.
Oh, I hate splitting the pot.
Well, that's the rule. There's nothing
you can do about it. So stop bitching.
Well, you can't talk to me like that.
I am the wife of fairview's
latino businessman of the year.
So he finally won?
yeah.
There's gonna be a huge dinner, and we're
taking a picture with the mayor and his wife.
Oh, not necessarily.
I hear they're getting divorced,
and it's gonna get ugly.
really? How do you know?
The wife hired the sleaziest, most
unethical divorce lawyer in town.
Who--who's
that?
My ex-husband.
Oh, right. Karl's a divorce lawyer.
Yeah, and a total shark.
The worst thing about our divorce was
that I couldn't hire him to represent me.
But I thought you just split
everything done the middle.
Oh, not with karl.
By the time he's done finding loopholes and
hiding assets, there's nothing left to split.
You don't say.
Hey, ladies. Uh, lynette,
ahem. It's getting kinda late.
Are you kicking us out, tom?
Uh, no. No, just reminding lynette that
it's, uh, ten minutes till midnight,
which means ten minutes till tomorrow.
I got it. I'll be right up.
What was that about?
Tom and I are reading this book that suggests couples
make a pact to have sex every night for a month.
Let me guess. Written by a guy?
Was his name carlos solis?
we've been having some problems, so the theory
is it creates intimacy and brings you closer.
Is it working?
I've gotta say it is.
You become more attuned to each
other's needs and more sensitive to--
lynette!
Je! Two seconds!
We--we
should go.
No, we're in our third week.
We got this down to a science.
Just deal me out a few hands.
juanita, hurry up. The bus
will be here any minute.
Be right down!
There's an extra piece of
cinnamon toast on the table.
Not hungry. Bye!
susan? It's dave.
Hey, remember I was telling you about my
buddy that owns that boat on bass lake?
Yeah, well, he's not using it this weekend, so
I thought maybe I'd take you and M.J.Fishing.
Yeah, I know it's short notice, but I
really wanted to do something to thank you.
You've been so good
to me since edie died.
Plus I know M.J.Would love it.
Great. I'm really looking
forward to it. Bye.
CH****
hello?
Oh, hi, principal hardy. What's up?
She's wearing what?
Now march in there and
wipe that stuff off!
You don't have to yell.
Yes, I do.
Do you have any idea how humiliating
it was for me to get that call today?
Now every parent in town is gonna think that
I let my 6-year-old wear makeup to school!
And I want my makeup
back. Is it in here?
why do you have this?
Juanita.
******
why?
Some girls at school saw you pick me up
yesterday and told me I must be adopted.
They said I wasn't pretty
enough to be your daughter.
how's it feeling?
I-it's really throbbing.
Oh, please hurry.
Okay.
hi there.
Jackson, hey. You're back.
I needed to talk to you.
Why didn't you call?
I wanted to surprise you.
Well, you did.
Oh, uh, right.
Jackson, you remember
mrs. Mccluskey, don't you?
Sure. How are you, mrs. Mccluskey?
Oh, I'm in agonizing
pain. Thanks for asking.
I'm taking her to the doctor so
he can perform a little procedure.
He's gonna lance a boil on my backside.
It may rupture any second.
Okay.
I just had my car detailed,
so I should probably go.
No problem. Uh, when can I see you?
how about dinner tomorrow night?
Sounds great.
If you t want to keep
staring at each other,
I can just go lay down on the
lawn and die. I don't mind.
Ll see you tomorrow.
karl.
Hey, mike.
Heard M.J.'S having a sleepover.
I thought I'd hit you
up for an invitation.
Aren't you a little old for sleepovers?
Cards on the table. I need your help.
Evan's one of the only boys in class who
wasn't invited, and he's really upset.
Okay, cards on the table.
M.J.Says evan's a bully, and he
doesn't want him at his sleepover.
Well, what if I promise evan
will be on his best behavior?
I'm sorry. It's out of my hands.
M.J.Finalized his guest list.
Well, I think if you check that list
again, you'll notice evan's name's on there.
I'm M.J.'S dad, not his bouncer.
But... thanks.
Hey, honey. How's your day going?
Very exciting. Just got
back from the grocery store.
It is double coupon day, sorta like the
oscars and the super bowl all rolled into one.
did you remember to get my, um...
my special deodorant?
I sure did. milady's armpits
will be aluminum-free.
How is your day?
I'm totally slammed,
which is why I'm calling.
It looks like I'm gonna be here late
tonight, and by "late," I mean past midnight.
Wait. W-what about our pact?
We'll... double up tomorrow.
Lynette, I have been looking
forward to this all day.
I know, and I'm really sorry.
Listen, I gotta go. I will
call you later. I love you. Bye.
tom. What are you doing
here? Is everything all right?
Everything's fine.
Well, then what are you doing... here?
oh, no. Are you crazy?
Crazy about you, baby.
But I have so much to do, and I'm
not gonna be done till 2:00 A.M.
Possibly 3:00.
Come on.
This is important.
Remember what the book said?
Every night, no matter what.
no, this is a really bad time for me.
Well, you did buy me that deodorant.
lynette, I have carlos on line two.
Uh, tell him I'll call right back.
He says it's really important.
Hello?
Hey, lynette. I'm over here at capital
consultants, and the guys have a question.
I need you to pull up their account.
Now? I'm kind of busy!
Well, the ad has to be at the
printer's by noon, so yeah, now.
lynette? Lynette!
Yes?
What's going on? You all right?
Sorry. Just had the handyman
in here, but he's finished.
Thank you, handyman.
you're welcome, ma'am.
So... carlos...
where were we?
Could I get you something?
No, thanks, I don't drink.
Oh, that's right. Glug
glug. I remember now.
I'm bringing you business, karl.
Try not to insult me.
Sorry. So you want to divorce orson.
Yes, I know that comes as a surprise.
Not really. I've met
him. The guy's a stiff.
Karl, if we move forward, I will insist
you handle our divorce with dignity.
are you sure?
I don't know of a dignified way to
screw a spouse out of money that they,
by law, are entitled to.
That is why you're hiring me, right?
I just want to protect
what is rightfully mine.
Can you help me?
sure.
Lovely. I'll make out a check.
Yeah, not so fast.
Uh, I said i could do
it, not that i would.
I need a favor.
Well, what kind of a favor?
M.J. Delfino is having a
sleepover at his house in two days.
My son wasn't invited.
Now his feelings are hurt.
So?
So I want you to get my
son into that sleepover.
How would I go about doing that?
Gosh, I don't know.
How would I go about hiding
your assets from orson?
I need your help, karl.
I really do, but I am not
comfortable manipulating a 6-year-old.
You know, I had this one client...
his wife had been with
him since junior high.
She supported him through med school, gave
him three kids and the best years of her life.
Once I had done my particular
brand of legal magic,
he ended up with 90% of the money, and
she ended up in a studio apartment...
with a roommate.
Then again... M.J.
Does... love my macaroons.
sweetie, don't listen to
those kids. They're idiots.
You are a gorgeous little girl.
You have to say that. You're my dad.
No, it's the truth. You
are naturally beautiful.
Makeup just covers that up.
He's right, sweetie. You don't
need all that gunk on your face.
Then why do you wear it?
Because I'm an adult.
And besides, I hardly wear any.
Come on, gaby. Let's
try to keep this real.
Are you gonna wear makeup
when daddy gets his big award?
Well, it's a big,
fancy dinner. Of course.
But that's not fair.
Sweetie, you're 6.
There's a lot of things
I can do that you don'T.
So you get to look pretty at daddy's
party, and i have to look like this?
Hey, I have a great idea.
Okay, see? Your daddy's
got a great idea.
How about if neither one of
you wears makeup to the dinner?
Okay.
no, no, no. Your
daddy's just being silly.
Can I talk to you for
a second, silly daddy?
are you a lunatic?
I am not walking into a ballroom
full of people without my face on.
Come on. This is the perfect opportunity
to teach her that beauty's only skin deep.
Yeah, well, once you see this skin without
foundation, you may want to rethink that.
Gaby, your daughter is in pain.
And don't you love her enough to
put your vanity aside for one night?
I was in labor for 20 hours.
She still owes me for that!
fine.
I will make the ultimate sacrifice,
and I will be ugly for my daughter.
But if she ever needs a kidney...
You're really going all
out on this sleepover.
although I'm not sure that tons of sugar
and whistles are a good combination.
Oh, good point.
I'll make us some goody bags
filled with earplugs and vodka.
It's great. I'm sure
M.J.Will appreciate it.
I'm sure he will.
He's a great K... and funny.
that was hilarious the other day, when
he asked us when we're getting married.
I'm glad you thought it was funny.
I was tap-dancing my ass off.
No, you were great.
Although... someday you'll probably
have to answer the question.
I'm sure he's forgotten
by now. You know kids.
Kids are like that.
Grown-ups on the other hand...
not so much.
We're not talking about
M.J. Ymore, are we?
Oh, you want to go run
and get your tap shoes?
No. No. I'll be completely honest here.
Moving in with you is one of
the best decisions I ever made.
you make me really, really happy.
But?
I've been married before, and I just
don't see myself getting married again.
Okay.
Probably not what you wanted to hear.
I wanted the truth.
It's not your fault the truth sucks.
So could you get the
streamers out of the car?
Sure.
Oh, by the way, for what
it's worth, I do love you.
I've only been working there
two months, but I love it.
And the kids are so cute.
And I get to see M.J. During
the day, which is nice.
Uh, you kn, uh, for a guy that
just had to see me so bad, you...
you seem awfully far away.
I'm sorry.
I'm just a little nervous.
I have something...
to ask you, and I don't
know how you're gonna react.
What is it?
This is gonna come
out of nowhere, but...
I want you to marry me.
A-and here's how I came to this.
The other day...
what are you doing?
I have to go upstairs.
Now?
susan, are you okay?
I'm fine.
I just didn't want you to see me crying.
Honey, you didn't let me finish.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Just, um, all I've been telling myself
that I didn't really care about you,
which was easy to do
because you left so suddenly.
But I am so lonely.
And as much as I tell myself that
i like being the strong,
single woman on her own,
the truth is, I think
about you all the time.
And I wanted to call you, but
I thought you'd gotten over me.
And to hear that you still love me...
that is just something that I
really needed to hear right now.
And I want you
to know- oh, god.
I want you to know I
love you, too. Jackson...
I love you.
jackson?
Oh,god.
I really wish you'd let me finish.
Finish what?
Susan,I need you to marry me so that
immigration doesn't deport me back to canada.
The one thing I didn't tell you is that I'm
here on a student visa that expired six y
and I got a call from the authorities,so
unless I can find somebody that will marry me,
I'm gonna be in really big trouble.
Susan?
Susan,did you hear me?
I heard.
So... what do you say?
Okay. Okay,it was a bad idea.
Get out or I will kick your
ass back to the canadian border!
took a shower,brushed my teeth.
We are good to go.
Lynette.
What are you doing?
You know,the pact.
Didn't we already do it tonight?
no.
Oh,they're all starting to blur.
look,I worked till 3:00
A.M.Last night. I'm exhausted.
How about we take a rain check?
A rain check? This isn't baseball.
Every night for 30
days- that's the law.
Tom,I have a 7:00 A.M.Meeting.
How about I take a long lunch,and
you do me twice at work tomorrow?
Come on.
This is important.
Okay.
Okay. We'll have sex.
But can you make it quick?
Lynette,please.
You can't rush an artist.
Morning.
Oh,sorry. I don't have
time for breakfast.
good. I didn't make you any.
Oh,okay. Uh,coffee will be fine.
Beans are right there.
Grab a handful and grind.
Is there a problem?
You don't remember?
Last night,we were having sex?
You fell asleep?
After?
During.
Was it good?
I didn't finish.
God,you ruined our streak,lynette.
I'm sorry. I was exhausted.
It's not like I was asking
you to scrub a floor.
All you had to do was lie
there,like you usually do.
Oh,okay. I'm gonna let that
one go,'cause you're upset.
Well,it's true. With you being so tired from work
lately,I'm the one doing all the heavy lifting.
Tom,you're being completely irrational.
We've had sex 23 days straight.
I've seen more ceilingthan michelangelo.
We made a commitment,lynette.
The book says--
oh,would you stop with the book?
You bought it at a car wash along
with a pack of gumand an air freshener.
You're right. It's stupid.
All my ideas are stupid. I
should just stick to doing chores.
Don't just walk away.
You better get to work,lynette.
You're gonna be late.
Haven't seen you boys in a while.
There's been a break in the
club fire case,mr. Williams.
You got a minute?
do you know this guy?
No. Who is he?
Dr. Samuel heller,psychiatrist
from boston.
He's the guy who burned up in the fire.
What's a shrink from
boston doing in fairview?
No idea,but we'd like to find out if
anyone knows him or what he was doing there.
Did you see him backstage?
No,I didn't see anybody.
Except porter scavo.
Yeah,but I told you. That was a mistake.
Do you know a guy named jackson braddock?
Was he?
Yeah,he got locked in the employee
men's room right before the fire started.
Well,I don't know anything about that.
Have you talked to him?
We've been trying,but he left
town,and we've been unable to find him.
That's a shame.
We'll figure it out.
Thanks for your time.
You bet.
hey,susan. It's dave.
You know,I was thinking I'd pick up you and
M.J.Around 6:00 A.M. Saturday for the trip.
Yeah. I figured the earlier
we get going,the better.
Okay.
well,hello there,M.J.
I was baking this morning,and like
an idiot,I made too many macaroons.
Would you be willing to take one?
I would hate to see them go to waste.
Macaroons are my favorite.
Oh,really? What a
delightful coincidence.
You know,I could bake
these for you every week,
and all I'd need in return
is just the tiniest of favors.
What kind of favor?
Invite evan mayer to your sleepover.
I don't like evan.
He's mean.
Oh,no. Deep down,he's just a fragile
little boy who wants to be liked.
He hit me with a dead squirrel.
Now,M.J.,We can find faults with
all our friends if we nitpick.
What do you say?
Will you invite him?
Would you like some ice
cream with your macaroons?
Because I could make that happen.
Bree?
I'm late for my golf game.
I don't have time to go to the A.T.M.,So
I took the cash out of your wallet.
Bye.
M.J.,There's someone in my life who hits
me with a dead squirrel every single day.
And you are the only
one who can help me.
Please,please invite evan to your party.
Okay.
thank you.
Oh,thank you,sweetheart.
Boy,the stuff I do for macaroons.
go away! I-I don't want to talk to you.
Come on. Let me in.
Thanks,but I've reached my maximum
allowance for humiliation this week.
Listen,I'm sorry you thought
it was a real proposal.
I thought you knew I'd moved on.
Maximum allowance exceeded.
What do you want?
I wanted to apologize.
You have every righto be mad at mE.
Oh,I'm not mad at you.
You know,I'm just
disappointed in myself.
I was a little lonely
and a little afraid and...
I just did what I always do- let
some silly romantic fantasy take over.
I didn't know you ill
felt that way about me.
I don'T.
This isn't about you.
Not really.
And besides,you moved on.
Well,I had to.
You pushed me away.
I had to... heal my
heart and get over it.
This--I mean,this is really the only thing
you can do to stay here and do your work?
Yeah.
I'll help you.
Really?
Yeah.
I'll do it. But that's it.
No love,no sex,just... marriage.
No sex?
You want people to think this
is a real marriage,don't you?
gaby,come on.
For god sakes,will you take those off?
It's 8:00 at night.
Oh,fine.
As long as you don't mind people thinking you're
out on the town with your anemic lesbian sister.
There's our man of honor.
gaby,this is stephanie. She
put this whole banquet together.
Nice to meet you.
You're probably wondering
why I look like this.
Excuse me?
I'm not ill.
I'm just not wearing any makeup so I can teach
my daughter that beauty's what's on the inside.
I don't actually look this hideous.
Okay.
Will you please stop
explaining yourself?
I mean,it was bad enough when
you did it with the valet.
I can't help it.
I don't want people
thinking I condone this face.
I'm gonna go find our table.
Champagne?
Oh,thank you.
I'm not ill. I'm just
not wearing any makeup.
gaby!
Gotta go.
come on,guys. No running in the house.
These candy apples are great.
Can me and evan have another one?
Well,I better ask katherine.
Where is katherine?
You're missing all the fun.
I just got a candied
apple out of a kid's hair.
Sounds like you got
everything under control.
No,come on down.
It's not as much fun without you.
Okay.
You were honest with me,so
I'm gonna be honest with you.
I got scared.
Of what?
I was hosting a party with this
amazing man and his adorable son,
and we were like the perfect
family,anthen I realized...
we're not a family.
It could all go away in an instant.
Katherine,I'm not leaving.
But you're not committing either.
Why not,mike?
Is it susan?
You still in love with her?
No. No,I've told you that.
Then it must be me.
Katherine,I love ving you in my life.
I'm just not ready.
I don't know what else to say.
I'm not trying to get
you to say anything.
I just have to take care of myself.
I should probably go make sure
the first floor is still there.
Excuse me. The mayor's about to leave,and the
newspaper wants a photo with him and your family.
Oh,that's so sweet.
tell him no way in hell.
Tell him we'll be right there.
The newspaper? Forget it.
Gaby,I do business with the city.
I can't just blow off the mayoR.
Seriously,we cannot allow
this to be photographed.
Next time there's an epidemic,people
are gonna think I'm patient zero.
You're not getting out of this.
Fine.
But just so we're clear,you're
also latino jerk of the year.
Come on. Let's go.
Oh,can I at least use
the bathroom first?
ladies! Attention,please.
I am in a jam,and I need
lipstick and eyeliner.
Come on. Chop chop.
You can use my makeup.
Oh,that doesn't really
go with my skin tone.
What do yomean? We
have the same coloring.
Yeah,it doesn't really go
with your skin tone either,
but I can only deal with
one disaster at a time.
Asian girl. Close enough.
Um,I don't think so.
Was it the "chop chop" thing?
Fine. I'm sorry.
Now can I borrow some blush?
I don't share cosmetics.
I'm sort of a germ freak.
Oh,don't worry. I'm
as healthy as a horse.
Really? You look sick.
That's 'cause I don't have any makeup!
I said no. Now leave me alone.
Okay,okay,look. I'm sorry.
You're right. I never should have asked.
Come out now,or I'll call security!
You know,for a woman who has a purse full of
dinner rolls,you sure have a lot of attitude.
Oh,good. We're all here.
By the way,mrs. Solis,you
look absolutely stunning.
Thank you.
Yeah,mom. You look great.
Okay,big smiles,everyone.
see this? My third espresso.
I'm wired. No way I'm
falling asleep tonight.
How about we throw a pizza on the front
lawn,and when the kids run out to get it,
we lock the door and do it
in every room in the house?
Tom,I'm sorry.
I don't know what else to say.
If you wanna stay mad,I
guess you're gonna stay mad.
I am not mad,lynette.
Then what's wrong?
You're gonna think it's stupid.
Tell me.
You want to know why sex has
become so important to me lately?
Because you are the only thing in
my life that I'm passionate about.
That is so sweet.
No. No,it's not good,lynette--
not for me,not for you.
I... I need something
else to be excited about.
I thought you wanted to do
this,to take a break and stay home.
I did.
You know,I figured,the kids are grown...
I can take care of the house and the
errands,and it'll be easy,and it is.
It's too damn easy.
I am finished with my work by noon,and then I
just sit around,waiting for you to come home.
So... what do you want to do?
What are you passionate about?
I don't know.
I'm a middle-aged guy,and I don't
know what I want to do with my life.
I told you it was stupid.
No.
No.
I know I disappointed you
tonight,and I'm really sorry.
It's okay.
I know why you did it.
I need makeup,too.
Honey,I know you think being pretty seems like
the most important thing in the world right now,
but believe me,it's not.
You were a model.
yes,I was.
And my whole life,people
told me how pretty I was.
So you know what?
I never thought I had to work hard in school
or work on friendships or my personality--
none of it.
And then I stopped modeling,and I
realized I didn't have much on the inside.
And I don't want that for you.
I want you to be brave
and funny and creative...
to be more than just a shell.
I want you to have the
whole rich,gooey center.
Will you promise to
do that for yourself?
Okay.
when do I get to wear makeup?
I tell you what.
You can wear makeup the day you
realize you don't really need it.
I bought M.J.A fishing pole.
I figure I'd teach the little guy
how to cast before we hit the water.
Oh,my god. We're not gonna be
able to make it this weekend.
I'm kind oF... getting married.
What?
to who?
dave williams.
I thought I heard you out here.
Jackson.
just when you thought I was
out of the picture,I'm back.
since you held up your end othe
bargain,I'm going to hold up mine.
I'm gonna make sure that you walk away from this
marriage with your business and your assets intact.
Now to accomplish this,I may
need you to lie,stonewall,
even resort to some outright trickery.
My question is... will
you be up for that?
I used to think of
myself as a good person.
If I had a choice,I would
always choose the high road.
Lately I've begun to realize that,um...
I'm capable of doing
whatever needs to be done.
You know what that makes you?
The perfect client.
on this street,the bargaining
is finished by sundown...
a daughter agrees to go to bed early if her
mother lets her dress up in her old gowns...
a woman agrees to let her fianc? spend the
night if he'll agree to sleep on the sofa...
a man allows his lover to get close as
long as they don't discuss the future.
Yes,everyone knows how to
bargain on wisteria lane...

Dave!
Is that the bathroom?
No.
I think that's it there.
Oh, okay.
Thanks.
Dave tried to eliminate
a witness to murder.
Hey! Uhh!
But Jackson survived...
I bought M.J. a fishing pole.
We're not gonna be able
to make it this weekend.
I'm kind of getting married.
What?
I thought I heard you out here.
Jackson.
Forcing him
to change his plans.
I'm a middle-aged guy...
Tom was searching.
And I don't know what
I wanna do with my life.
We're rich again!
Hallelujah!
Gaby's life returned to normal.
We're gonna be us again--
the old Carlos and Gaby.
I'm gonna make sure that you
walk away from this marriage
With your assets intact.
Now to accomplish this...
And Bree agreed to protect
what she felt was hers.
I'm capable of doing
whatever needs to be done.
 The lawyer arrived
just after sundown.
He checked to make sure
no one was watching,
then he hurried
to the front door...
where his client was waiting.
As she poured him
the scotch he requested,
the client began to wonder
exactly how he planned
to hide her assets
from the husband
she was divorcing.
The lawyer suggested
some creative accounting.
His client agreed.
He suggest a secret bank account.
She agreed.
He suggested a
second set of books.
She agreed.
And then the lawyer looked
deep into his client's eyes
and made one final suggestion...
that she was
completely unprepared for.
You want me to rob
my own house?!
Not exactly. I was thinking we'd
hire my friend Tony to do it.
Absolutely not.
I am all up for
a little creative accounting
and some
secret bank accounts,
but hiring some thug
to stage a break-in?
It's a community property state,
babe.
Orson's going to get half
of everything,
including your jewelry,
your artwork, your antiques.
Wouldn't it be easier
to just have him killed?
As your lawyer,
I can't condone that.
That said, I have a cousin--
I was kidding!
So was I.
Loosen up, freckles.
Well, I just never know
with you.
And don't call me
"freckles."
Look, if you're not
comfortable with Tony,
why don't we do the job
ourselves?
I bet you'd look hot
in a ski mask.
You are repugnant,
and this conversation is over.
Fine, but since I'm charging you
for the full hour,
let me make it worth your while.
Sit down and close your eyes.
What? No!
Just humor me. Come on.
Now I want you to picture Orson
after the divorce.
He owns half of your business,
half of your assets.
You see it?
Go on.
Now I want you to picture Orson
dating some young bimbo.
And don't kid yourself.
He will get a bimbo.
Now picture
your favorite strand of pearls
dangling in the 24-year-old
cleavage of said bimbo
while she is using
your first edition
Robert Frost as a coaster...
And your 19th century
french crystal vase
as an ashtray.
If you can live with that...
I will leave.
And with that,
The client offered
a suggestion of her own...
We should probably
break a window
to make it look more real.
And the lawyer agreed.
Masks--
you can find them in any home.
Some are used once a year
to scare the neighbors...
Some are needed
for the occasional chore.
Some are applied
every other Thursday.
Then there's the kind of mask
some men wear every day.
It's a friendly smile
designed to hide
the most wicked of intentions.
Hey, M.J.,
is your mom home?
She's inside talking
to Jackson.
Really?
So... what do you think
of Jackson?
I like him.
He buys me comic books.
Yeah, he's a good guy.
He was very brave
that night
during that fire
at the nightclub.
Does he ever talk about
that fire...
or anybody he saw
that night?
Have the police stopped by
to ask him any questions?
If they do,
would you let me know?
Why?
Well...
I wanna make sure they're being
nice to our friend Jackson,
'cause he's such a good guy.
It is such a stunning piece.
It's simple and elegant.
Don't you think?
I mean, I know
it was expensive,
but you can't put a price tag
on beauty. Am I right?
So when daddy finds out
how much I spent,
would it be okay if
I used you as a human shield?
You know, I should really
get you tested.
Mom?
Hey! Did you have
a fun playdate with Heather?
She's got a canopy bed.
I want one.
We just bought you a bed.
It's not even a year old.
I don't like it anymore.
I wanna sleep under a canopy.
Then go move in with Heather,
'cause I'm not getting you one.
Why not? We're rich.
Who told you that?
I heard you telling Aunt Bree,
since daddy got his new job,
we're rolling in money.
Well, mommy shouldn't have
said that.
Just, when Aunt Bree started
bragging about her Prada bag,
mommy kind of lost it.
Whatever.
I want a canopy,
and you gotta get me one.
I don't have to
get you anything.
And stop acting
like a spoiled brat.
I am not spending a fortune
on a bed you don't need.
Oh, but you can spend millions
of dollars on a stupid vase?
That vase is not stupid.
Is that vase stupid?
Okay, you know what?
This conversation is over.
Go to your room!
You, too, bobblehead.
Okay, my clothes
are in the closet.
I'm going to put my toothbrush
in the bathroom.
Oh,
just leave the toilet seat up,
and the immigration people will
totally think we're married.
Yeah, I don't know how I'm gonna
thank you for doing this.
Actually, I did think of one way
you could repay me.
Mmm. You got it.
Uh, no.
not like that.
No, I was thinking that after
our quickie courthouse ceremony,
you could buy me a cake.
I love wedding cake.
It's the one part of marriage
that never lets you down.
Well, I can do you
better than that.
How out I throw us
a big engagement party?
What?
Well, we're not having
a wedding,
and we're gonna need
pictures of something
to put in our photo album
as evidence.
Okay. Yeah,
I guess that could be fun.
While our friends are toasting
to our everlasting happiness,
we can yell,
"surprise! It's all a sham!
Thanks for the crock-pot!"
No, no, no. We can't tell
anybody this is a fake.
The whole thing could blow up.
Can't I at least tell the girls?
No way. I mean, they don't
call her "gabby" for nothing.
Wow.
Ah, fake marriages--
they're complicated.
I-I-I know I'm asking a lot,
Susan.
No, no. It's okay.
I wanna do this.
Truth is...
I miss you,
and the house has been kinda
lonely since you left.
Well, I hear you
loud and clear.
Not that lonely.
What are you doing?
Thinking.
Well, think inside.
I made pork chops.
Aren't you gonna ask me
about my job interview?
Oh, right. How'd that go?
Okay... until the 30-year-old
who was interviewing me asked me
if I'd ever used twittering
as part of a marketing campaign.
And what'd you say?
Nothing...
Because I don't know
what "twittering" is.
It's a social networking tool
where you send instant updates
to anybody
who signs up for them.
So... you knew about this,
and yet you kept it from me?
I didn't keep it from you.
It's just
one of those tech things
that you don't care about.
It's for young people.
And I am a dinosaur
marching into the tar pit.
I didn't say that.
You're not gonna get
a whole lot of sympathy from me.
I just went through
the same thing. Remember?
Yeah, but you didn't tell me
how bad it was.
That's another thing
you kept from me.
50 guys showed up
for that one job,
and I was 10 years older
than every single one of 'em.
I could hear 'em twittering
as I left the room.
I think you mean
"tittering."
Sorry. Please, don't hit me.
I heard a door slam shut today,
Lynette.
It's official.
My time has passed.
I am no longer relevant.
Oh, for God sakes,
knock it off!
I am not gonna let you
feel sorry for yourself.
You are Tom Scavo,
damn it!
And?
Sorry. I got nothing else.
Come inside and eat your pork.
This place smells funny.
I don't wanna be here.
Well, you should've
thought about that
before you started acting like
such a diva. Now sit down.
Father Crowley!
This is a surprise.
What brings you
to our soup kitchen?
Well, I want Juanita
to work with the poor.
I want to teach her
to be grateful
for how good she has it.
Oh, well, we can always use a hand.
And four hands?
Well, that's a blessing.
Oh, me? No, no.
Not me.
I'm not really dressed
for ladling,
but, um, I could stand
by the condiment bar
and spritz people
with my Chanel.
And you say Juanita
is a little ungrateful? Hmm.
Fran Schulman?
Fran.
Huh?
It's Gabrielle Solis
from the tennis club.
Oh, of course.
Wow, it's been years!
The last time I saw you was
at that charity fashion show.
Wasn't that fun?
Yes. Yes, it was.
So what are you doing here?
Are you volunteering?
Not exactly.
Me either.
My daughter's gotten
so snooty,
I am forcing her to spend time
with the great unwashed.
You wanna ditch this place
for a cappuccino?
Um, actually,
I'm here to eat.
Oh!
It's Susan.
Great. We don't see
enough of her.
And she's not alone.
Hey, Jackson. Long time no see.
What's going on?
Um... we sort of have
an announcement.
We're getting married.
Oh, my God!
This is such great news!
Oh!
So... when's the date?
Monday.
Whoa. W--
well, that's kind of sudden.
Well, when you know, you know.
Why wait? And we're having a
little engagement party on Friday,
and you're both invited.
A party? Count us in.
I can't think of a better reason
to... celebrate.
Have you told M.J. yet?
Yeah. He was on board when he
found out there was cake.
Okay.
Just wanna make sure this isn't
all happening too fast for him.
You know kids. They need
a little time to adjust.
Oh, kids are resilient.
He'll be fine. I'm so excited!
Well, uh, we wanted you two
to be the first to know,
and we should probably
get going.
Got a few more neighbors
to shock.
Oh, well, we are just
so happy for you.
Yeah. Congratulations.
Now if we're going with
the Damask for the settee,
then I strongly suggest that
we do the couch in the chenille.
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
The only word I understood
there was "couch."
I'll explain it to him
later.
Good, because they're
only going to hold this fabric
for a couple of days.
Well, I am off.
Ohh.
Isn't that vase divine?
I am so glad you like it.
I thought we were
just trying out the vase.
I'll explain it to him later.
Okay.
Mm-hmm. Thank you.
Can you believe this?
Seven years ago,
Evelyn did Fran's house.
Now? No house.
That's crazy.
You ask Fran what happened?
No! I didn't want
to embarrass her.
You met her in line
for free soup.
How much more embarrassed
could she get?
Remember that dinner party
she gave?
She had 20 place settings
of Tiffany china.
How does this happen to someone
who has Tiffany china?
This is $200 a yard.
Tell Fran to save us
a place in line.
I bet I know what happened.
She drank it away.
That one New Year's Eve
where she got so plowed
she fell in the koi pond...
where she landed on you,
drunky sue.
Everybody was hammered
at that party.
Well, then it must've been
a gambling problem.
Based on what?
She never missed bingo night
at Immaculate Heart...
and she was Lutheran.
You really think
she bingo'ed her house away?
Uh, I don't know.
There has to be some reason.
You don't fall that far
that fast
without making
some really stupid choices.
Why you gettin' so angry?
It was
Tiffany china, Carlos.
Aha! There's the man
that ruined my fishing trip.
Sorry about that, Dave.
Oh, no worries.
Hey, I am so happy for you
and Susan. Congratulations.
Thanks.
So how have you been?
We haven't had
a chance to talk since...
I don't know,
probably the fire.
Uh, yeah.
You were the big hero.
I was the doofus that got
stuck in the men's room.
Oh, that was a hell of a night.
Sure would like to forget that.
Yeah, me, too.
Unfortunately, I have to go down
and talk to the cops on Tuesday.
Really?
Yeah. I went down to city hall
to get my marriage certificate,
And I ran in one of
the detectives from that night,
and apparently, they've been
trying to get in touch with me.
So now I get to go down there
the day after my wedding.
Some honeymoon, huh?
Wow. Those guys really know
how to put a crimp in your day.
So did they say what they wanted
to talk to you about?
I guess they just wanna know
if I saw anything suspicious.
Hmm. Did you?
Mm, no.
I mean, I was backstage.
I was headed to the men's room,
and I ran into--
Oh! Ugh!
I am so sorry.
Oh, no. Don't worry about it.
I'll take care of it.
I mean, there's gotta be a mop
around here somewhere.
That's not coming out.
Oh, Bree can get rid
of that in a jiffy.
Now where did she go?
Okay. Showtime.
Wipe your feet first.
I just had
the carpets cleaned.
Just because we're thieves
doesn't mean
we need to be untidy.
Are we stealing this?
Uh, yes. As I recall,
it's quite valuable.
What about this?
Oh, God, no.
That's Orson's dental Innovator
of the Year award.
I've always hated
that thing.
Oh, here.
What are you doing?
I, uh, took some of my silver
off the mantle,
and it threw off
the balance.
Yeah.
You're right. Let me help.
There. Balance restored.
Was that necessary?
This place has to look like
it was ransacked by robbers,
not someone's personal shopper.
Fine! But do you have
to do it with such relish?
Hey, you're not paying me
to just go through the motions.
Speaking of which... are you
nailing Orson like we discussed?
That is
none of your business.
Well, we have to make sure
he doesn't suspect anything.
I do the bare minimum.
No more, no less.
So is he just missionary?
He seems like a strictly
missionary kind of guy.
Must you be so crude?
Must you always be
such a priss?
You freak out
at the mention of sex.
You never want
to make a mess.
You suppress every spontaneous
urge you ever have!
Man, it must be exhausting
being you!
Yes, being a lady
takes effort.
Well, maybe give it a rest
once in a while.
It might surprise you
how good it feels.
You wanna be a Neanderthal,
Karl? That's your choice.
I prefer to behave
with class and dignity.
Now may we please finish
robbing my home?
Bill Brown!
It's Tom Scavo.
Tom! Oh, my God!
What are you doing here?
Well, Jackson and I are in
the same soccer league.
Lynette, this is Bill Brown.
We were roommates
freshmen year in college.
Hi.
Really?
Yeah!
God, you look fantastic.
You haven't aged a day.
Hey, right back at ya.
Liar. You didn't even
recognize me.
Back up a second.
You guys were classmates?
Yeah.
Meaning you were in
the same class at the same time?
That's what classmates means,
Lynette. We're the same age.
Actually, I think
I'm six months older.
You're older?!
I'm sorry,
I just cannot believe...
That they're out
of stuffed mushrooms.
Excuse me.
Okay, my wife's annoying,
but she is right.
What's your secret?
What is it? Diet? Exercise?
You eatin' a bowl of stem cells
every morning?
Come on. What's going on,
Peter Pan?
Okay...
You really wanna know?
Hi!
This is for you and Jackson.
Congratulations!
Aw, how sweet.
Oh! And heavy.
Score.
Yeah, well, we can afford
to be generous
now that I'm off the hook
for alimony.
Yeah. What?
You're getting remarried.
So I can stop
sending that check every month.
Everybody gets a gift.
Right!
Score for you!
Uh, can I talk to you for a sec?
Yeah?
Oh, thank you.
You get alimony?
I thought you were too proud
take alimony.
I was too proud to admit it.
I'm not too proud to take it.
I need that money, Jackson.
Well, I-I can try to chip in.
"Chip in"?
It's not a birthday cake
for Shirley in accounting.
It's mortgage and food
and insurance.
I'm sorry,
but I can't marry you.
No, Susan,
they'll send me back.
It's Canada, not Iran.
It's like America
with free health insurance.
Okay, I know this is
important to you,
but I depend on that check every month.
And I know you do.
I just can't believe that I
finally found a job that I love,
and now I just gotta
give it up.
Well, look, maybe...
I could talk to Mike.
I could see if we could
work something out.
You'd do that?
Yeah, I'll try.
Don't think he's not gonna
want his gift back.
And it's really heavy, too.
So...
you thought my friend bill
looked pretty fantastic, huh?
Okay, I went
a little overboard.
You know me--two margaritas,
and I need a muzzle.
No, I completely agree with you.
He looks really young.
I know, right?
He must take care of himself.
Actually,
he told me his secret,
and I'm thinking of doing
the same thing.
No, you're not having
plastic surgery.
It's my face.
Uh, we live in
a community property state,
so half that face is mine.
Fine, you know what?
You get the half below the nose.
But these wrinkles up here?
All going away.
Tom, men don't need
plastic surgery.
They look better
as they age.
Real?
Because you couldn't
stop talking
about how great Bill looked.
"you guys were classmates?
You mean the same class
at the same time?"
Okay,
that's a lousy impression of me.
Look, Bill said it really gave
him a leg up in job interviews,
and I could use that
right now.
You don't need a face-lift.
What if I went out
and got a boob job
and came home with
big, giant sideshow boobs?
How would you like that?
I'd learn to live with it
somehow.
You're not doing this.
We can't afford it!
It's an investment in our
future. We can't afford not to.
I'm calling the doctor
and making an appointment.
If you want, I can also get
a price check on a pair of--
I'm not getting a boob job.
Why don't I make you
a nice cup of Earl Grey...
Oh, dear God.
Orson,
we've been robbed!
It wasn't me. I swear.
No cuts!
Back of the line.
Oh, relax. I already
ate dinner at home...
in my box under the bridge.
Fran?
Oh, God. I was afraid
I wouldn't find you here.
Ah, lucky you,
I'm still poor.
I feel bad I ducked out
so fast the other day.
And I've been thinking
about you a lot,
and I just--
I really wanna help.
Wow.
Thank you. Thank you!
Now...
I just wanna make sure
that you're not gonna...
you know...
Drinking was never
my problem, Gaby.
I didn't think so.
You were always so classy.
20, 40, 60...
Was it drugs?
No. I never did drugs.
Good to know.
80, 100.
Because gambling is bad enough
without being high.
I never gambled
a day in my life, Gaby.
Well, then what the hell happened?
This doesn't make sense.
I was at your house.
You had such lovely things.
Yes, Mark and I lived
really well.
Probably a little...
too well.
But we were young,
and we thought we had time
to save for the future.
Then he died.
Mark died?
I didn't know.
He was sick
a really long time.
He couldn't work.
He lost his insurance.
By the time he passed away,
we were completely wiped out.
Oh, Fran, I'm so sorry.
You didn't have any family
to turn to? Any friends?
No family, and as it turns out,
not too many friends either.
Look, Gaby,
know you came here
wanting to find out what I did
to make this all happen.
But the truth is, we're all
just an accident or a tumor
or a bad investment away
from...
standing in line for free soup.
Thank you.
I don't agree, Fran.
You know, Carlos went blind
for five years.
We went broke.
We almost lost our house.
But we worked our asses off
and we made it back.
Oh, so just because
you survived that,
you think you've crossed
some kind of finish line,
that nothing bad
can happen again?
Well, no, but--
Listen.
I hope it works out for you.
I hope you never lose that
big, beautiful home of yours.
God knows I wish I'd appreciated
mine more while I had it.
Thank you again.
Remind me again when you're
getting your teeth cleaned.
Um... the 14th.
And the 15th,
we have tickets
to that play
that you're dragging me to.
Yes. Why?
I'm just--I'm trying
to figure out
when would be a good time
to get married.
I'm sorry.
What did you just...
I know, I know.
Not the most romantic proposal
in the world.
I shouldn't have led
with the teeth cleaning.
I feel I can overlook that.
So is that a yes?
Yes! It's a yes!
Oh!
Wow! What brought this on?
It just seemed
like the right time.
Oh, Mike.
I'm so happy.
I love you.
I love you, too.
I understand taking things,
but why smash something
you're gonna leave behind?
They're robbers,
dear. Not personal shoppers.
Yeah, well, whoever did this
should be shot.
Well, I wonder if the victims
of your kleptomania
felt the same way.
You know what?
You're absolutely right.
I never realized what
my stealing put people through.
Maybe this is karma.
What is that?
Oh.
It's a picture of the mask
they stole.
I drew it from memory.
Wow.
Hmm.
Remember where we got it?
Was it Florence?
Venice.
We walked past that little shop
under the bridge,
and you saw it in the window.
Oh, that's right.
Mm.
You told me you'd been
wearing a mask all your life,
but with me, you felt--
Like I could finally
take it off and be myself.
Yeah.
Anyway, I faxed it
to the shop in Venice.
They said they could
make a new one.
I should have it for you
in about a month.
I can't believe you went
to all that trouble
then you must not know
how much you mean to me.
Hello? Oh, hi, Dave.
No, of course not.
What's on your mind?
Well, I figured it was time
to get back to work,
so I put together
a speaking tour--
Seattle, Portland,
my usual route.
Work? Are you sure it's not too soon?
Well, I have to do it eventually.
Anyway, I was hoping
you could check in
on the house now and then.
Of course.
Oh, someone's at my door.
Let me get rid of them.
Hey, Katherine,
is Mike here?
No, he's at work.
Oh, shoot. Um...
Well, can you tell him to call
me as soon as he gets back?
Sure.
Is everything okay?
Uh, well...
Okay, you know what? Mike's
probably gonna tell you anyway,
so just can't tell
anyone else, okay?
There's not a problem
with the wedding, is there?
It's still on, right?
It depends.
Jackson and I
are only getting married
because he needs
his green card.
Oh.
And then I realized
that I would lose my alimony.
So unless Mike will keep
paying me, I can't get married.
You have to.
I mean, poor Jackson.
I-I would hate to see him
deported back to...
where's he from?
Canada.
Oh! Oh! Brr!
We can't have that!
If you want, I could
talk to Mike for you.
That would be great.
Just tell him
I need an answer quickly
'cause the wedding is Monday.
Well, don't cancel anything yet.
You'll have your answer tonight.
Thanks.
Sorry, Dave.
Dave?
Hey.
Hey, Lynette.
How's it going?
Oh, my husband wants
to spend money we don't have
on a face-lift he doesn't need,
so... not great.
Mm, tell him to be careful.
Have you seen
Bruce in payroll?
He just went in
for a little nip and tuck.
And? How's he look?
Like he's standing
in a wind tunnel.
Really?
Mm-hmm.
Poor Bruce.
Yep.
What's his extension?
And I'm thinking
I may have acted rashly.
I mean, every marriage has
its rough patches.
Orson loves me,
and deep down, he's a good man.
If I stick with this,
maybe we can make it work.
Are you even listening
to me?
Don't need to.
Heard it all before.
Oh, really?
I've been doing this
20 years.
And trust me,
every woman gets cold feet.
"Am I making a mistake?"
"Was he really that bad?"
"Maybe I could try harder.
And I'm gonna tell you
what I tell them--
you're not making a mistake.
He really is that bad.
And no matter how hard you try,
he's still gonna be
the same jerk
who sent you into this office
in the first place.
Oh. So I'm just like
everyone else,
and you know everything
I'm going to say.
Yep.
I even know the stuff
you're not going to say.
I doubt that.
Let me give it a shot.
You've been thinking,
"What happens if
I walk away from Orson
and everything I invested
in this relationship?"
"Will I ever find
another man?"
Will you spend
the rest of your life alone?
Close?
In the ballpark.
Well, you listen to me.
You've got nothing
to worry about.
You're a beautiful,
elegant, classy woman,
and there's no way
you're gonna end up alone.
And do you say that
to every woman, too?
No.
I mean, I get some real uggos
in here.
You know, the kind
that are gonna die alone
and get eaten by their cats.
Charming.
So are we back in business?
Send me the papers
when they're ready.
Honey, I'm glad you're home.
I brought someone me from
work I want you to meet.
w--
Ohh.
Yeah. It turns out he
got the same procedure
that you're thinking
about getting.
So I thought maybe you
could chat him up about it.
So you're finally
on board with this?
Well, like you said,
it's your face.
Come on, I'm dying for you
to meet Bruce.
Bruce, I want you to meet
my husband Tom.
Hi, Tom.
So, um, Lynette tells me
you're thinking about having
a little elective surgery.
Did she?
Mm-hmm.
Now you may not
be able to tell,
but I've had work done.
Really?
Have they finished?
Yeah.
Now I should warn you
that, uh...
after they operate,
it looks a little weird.
Oh, I was wondering
about that. Yeah.
But eventually it settles,
like this.
Mm.
Isn't it exciting, Tom?
In a few weeks, you are gonna
look just like Bruce.
Hey, if you want, I'll give you
the name of my surgeon.
Yes. I definitely want the name
of the guy who did that.
Lynette, um, Bruce looks like
he could use something to drink,
and I know that I sure could.
C-could you excuse us
for a sec?
Very clever, Lynette--inviting
the joker over to scare me.
I wanted you to see the face
they don't put in the brochure.
I will be having my work done
by a reputable surgeon.
Bruce looks like
his was done by a bear.
That's my point.
You don't know how these
things will turn out.
Well, I am willing to take
that risk. I'm doing it.
Why are you being
so stubborn?
Why do you care so much?
Because I don't want to have
plastic surgery.
What?
Tom, if you're unsatisfied
with your looks,
someday you're gonna
be unsatisfied with mine.
No.
No.
Yes.
You are going to look at me
someday with your brand-new face
And say,
"when did she get so old?"
We won't look like
we belong together anymore.
Lynette, I'm just talking about
gettin' rid of a few wrinkles.
But I don't see
your wrinkles, Tom.
I see our whole life
together.
This...
is you worrying about how
you're going to provide for us.
This is Penny
falling out of the tree house
and breaking her arm.
This is my cancer.
These are
the millions of laughs
that got us through
all those tough times.
It's like
a map of our marriage,
and I don't want
to lose it.
And it if keeps me
from getting a job?
You're gonna get a job,
And it'll be because they're
impressed by your experience,
not your wrinkle-free face.
I know exactly what
you mean.
And I love your face, too.
Mmm.
Mmm.
And this wrinkle here,
that's when--
This isn't about me, Tom.
Come on. Mwah.
Hey.
Good news.
Looks like we're getting
fake married after all.
Really?
Yeah.
Mike agreed to keep paying me
alimony. He just sent me a text.
Oh, man. That's a relief.
And unbelievably generous.
I'm gonna send him
a thank-you right now.
You're welcome.
You know,
I really can't tell you
how much I appreciate
you doing this for me, Susan.
And I promise,
as long as I'm here,
I'll pitch in around the house,
run errands.
You know,
just like a real husband.
Clearly, you've never
been married before.
Well, you know,
just because this is, um...
a fake marriage, doesn't mean
it can't be wonderful.
Well, I've been in some
real marriages that weren't,
so... maybe you're right.
Oh, look. Cans.
You can't have a wedding
without cans and signage!
Sweet!
Let's get to the car wash
on our way to the courthouse.
Mm-hmm.
Jackson Braddock?
Yes?
We're with immigration.
You're in the country
on an expired visa.
You're gonna have to come with us.
Oh, no, no, no.
You--you can't take him now.
Ma'am, I need you to step back.
Susan, there's a business card
on the dresser
with an attorney's number. Would
you call him for me, please?
Please, can't this wait?
We're about to get married.
Not today you're not.
What's going on? Who are these guys?
Uh... immigration agents,
and I think they're...
sending Jackson back to Canada.
Hello?
May I speak with, uh,
Bree Van de Kamp?
Oh, she's not in at the moment.
Can I take a message?
Uh, yeah, this is Sheila
with Weston Brothers Storage.
It's about the storage
unit she just rented.
Storage unit?
Uh, yeah, we overcharged her
on the deposit.
Tell her not to worry.
We're gonna deduct it
from her next bill.
Okay. Uh, thank you.
You're welcome.
Everyone wears
some kind of mask,
so you must look closely
to find the truth
that lies beneath.
Hi. Mwah.
Some conceal anxiety
about growing older.
Some hide fears
of financial ruin.
Others cover up a love
that continues to linger.
And then there are those
who let their masks slip.
If you look to their eyes,
you'll see
who they really are...
and exactly what
they're capable of.

Previously on...
We're getting married.
One proposal
led to another.
We're with immigration.
But the law gets in the way.
Can't this wait?
We're about to get married.
Not today, you're not.
 A break-in was staged...
Orson, we've been robbed.
in an attempt to hide assets
in a divorce.
After the crash...
And the truth about
the accident came out.
Mike told 'em that he was
driving, but it wasn't true.
 The thing
you have to understand
about Dave Williams
is he wanted to be forgiven.
That's why he made
the videotape.
I didn't want to kill
M.J. Delfino.
I had to.
Susan Mayer killed
my wife and daughter.
The police called it...
an accident.
But I don't believe a person
who takes two precious lives
should be allowed to just...
walk away.
I know some people will wonder,
why didn't I just kill Susan?
But what good
would that have done?
She'd be dead.
There'd be no...
suffering.
And to those who hate me
because I took the life...
of an innocent young boy,
I say...
Aw, crap.
Yes, Dave Williams wanted
everyone to forgive him...
Look, I got a new tackle box
for our trip on Saturday.
But not until
he finished doing...
the unforgivable.
After
the White Horse nightclub
was destroyed
by a suspicious fire,
one body was left unclaimed.
The detectives on this case
referred to him as...
"John Doe A-37."
For months,
they tried to identify him.
Then one day, they got a call
from an impound lot.
It seems a car had been towed
from the club parking lot
the night of the fire--
a car
that had been rented...
to a Dr. Samuel Heller
from Boston,
who had been reported missing
four months earlier.
The doctor's dental records
confirmed their theory.
His receptionist, however,
did not.
No way.
Dr. Heller did not die
in that fire.
Ma'am, we've got
his dental records.
I don't care. You said
the fire was four months ago?
Well, I've gotten texts
from him since then.
You have?
Yeah. The last one was
just a few weeks ago.
Hmm.
Maybe we should
send a text back.
Ma'am, you have your phone
with you?
Hey, Dave.
I was gonna call you.
You were?
Yeah. Um... did you
say something to M.J.
about going on that fishing trip?
Yeah, I did.
I know how depressed you've been
since Jackson was deported,
so I thought,
now is the perfect time
for the three of us to go
up to the lake. And...
I got M.J. his own little life vest.
I wish I could, but I can't.
I'm worried about Jackson.
All the more reason.
You know what they say
about fishing--
it's nature's tranquilizer.
Dave, I haven't heard from
Jackson since he was taken away,
and I just wanna be here
in case he calls.
Yeah, well, that's okay.
Just bring your cell phone.
I'd just feel more comfortable
if I'm close by.
Oh, that's crazy.
I mean, Jackson wouldn't
want you sittin' around here
worrying about him.
I'm sorry.
We'll go fishing another time.
Don't you think you're being
a little selfish here?
And what about M.J.?
You wanna go fishing, don't you, buddy?
Yeah!
Yeah.
What are you doing?
I just told you I can't go.
I'm just thinking about M.J.
He'll be fine.
You know what?
You're right.
I'm sorry.
It's just a trip.
You're not listening!
Six months in Europe
would be educational.
You know what would be
more educational?
You going to college
like we talked about.
Mom, I've already been in school
for 12 years already.
I... I need a vacation.
Well, it seems like, based
on your last few report cards,
you've already been
on vacation.
I'm gonna be 18. If I wanna
go to Europe, I'll go to Europe.
Oh? Well, good luck
paying for it,
because if you so much
as apply for a passport,
we're cuttin' you off.
Cut off from the mighty
Scavo family fortune? Oh, no!
Tom, why didn't you
help me out there?
Because I agree with him.
What?
Well, he's young.
He should be having fun.
I mean, look--look at me.
I'm a middle-aged man
reading the want ads
for jobs that I'll never get.
I should've gone to Europe
when I had the chance.
Hey, focus.
Our son is
throwing his life away.
We have got to keep him on track.
What is so great
about the track?
I was on it. I did everything
I was supposed to.
It chewed me up
and spit me out.
I know you're discouraged,
But... letting our son
make a huge mistake
is not gonna help anything.
Even if it is a huge mistake,
you got to let people make some
decisions about their own life.
Your way
is not the only way.
I am just
trying to help Preston
avoid the way marked
"unemployable loser."
Fine.
What do you want me to do?
I want you to get this stupid
Europe idea out of his head.
Take him on a tour
of the campus.
Get him excited.
Show him college could be fun.
Sure.
And on the way home,
I'll show my college diploma
to the guy at the Burger Barn.
Ohh.
Yeah. They're hiring a new
fry cook for the night shift.
If you're really
stopping by there,
bring home some onion rings.
Mommy, what are you doing?
We're going to a family reunion
at Aunt Connie's on Saturday,
and I want to look my best.
Is it gonna be fun?
Well, if your idea
of a good time
is sitting on rusty lawn chairs
in the driveway
eating lard
the shaped fried chicken,
then yeah! It's gonna be a blast.
The driveway?
Honey, you're 6 now,
so I think it's time we had
a little mother/daughter talk.
Your father's side
of the family's trash.
Any questions?
If you don't like her,
why are you putting on
your best jewelry?
'Cause that's what grownups do,
sweetie.
when we don't like someone,
we don't punch them
or say mean things.
We just find subtle ways
to make them feel bad
about their lives.
Ooh, like these earrings.
Aunt Connie can't afford them,
and that'll make her sad.
And this will bring her
to her knees.
And this will be
a kick in her throat.
If you hate 'em so much,
maybe we shouldn't go.
Oh, no, sweetie. We have to go.
They're family.
See, this is why I wanted
to check on my things.
You don't leave a valuable
painting on the damn floor.
You need to put something
underneath it.
Fine. How about
this ugly doormat?
That is not a doormat.
That is a handwoven
Kurdish Kazak rug.
You know, Bree,
when I hang out with you,
I realize how little I know
and how much
I don't give a crap.
Give me that.
I'm so glad this divorce
is almost over.
An obnoxious, unpleasant man
will be out of my life,
and so will Orson.
Hey, it's not over yet.
You still got
a couple of hurdles.
Has Orson brought up
the insurance claim again?
No, he thinks I filed it.
Great. When he realizes you
never did, you'll be divorced,
he'll be broke,
and it won't matter.
Yes,
and I'll be single again,
and I can concentrate
on my business,
maybe do some traveling.
Maybe spend a little time
at the intersection
of right leg and left leg,
If you know what I'm saying.
Sadly, Karl, I always
know what you're saying.
You know, if you want,
I could set you up.
I know a lot of great guys who
are good for a free dinner.
And a few laughs, huh?
Thanks, Karl.
I'm not even divorced yet,
and once I am, I don't think
you'd be my first choice
as a matchmaker.
Oh, shoot.
Hello?
Hey, Susan, it's me.
Jackson,
I have been so worried.
Where--where are you?
Fairview jail.
They're processing
my deportation papers.
So they're sending you back?
When?
Couple days.
I just wanted to call
and say thank you and...
tell you that I'll miss you.
Well... I'll miss you, too.
I mean,
you came in my life
when I was going through
a really hard time,
and you were amazing.
I mean, you are amazing.
You, too.
So...
Did the immigration people
tell you
how they found out about you?
Anonymous tip.
Although it's pretty obvious
who "anonymous" is.
Does Mike really
think I'm that stupid?
Mike?
You think Mike did this?
Who else?
Mike and Katherine were
the only people who knew.
Katherine was doing cartwheels
about us getting married, so...
Yeah, but, no,
this doesn't make any sense
because Mike knew
that it wasn't for real.
Well, real or not,
he had the look of a guy
who's not ready
to give you up, so--
Time's up.
Uh, I-I gotta go.
I'll try and call you again
before I leave.
Hey!
Hey, hey,
how was the campus tour?
Fantastic.
Oh!
Oh, my God.
That school is amazing.
Oh.
The professors are so engaged,
and the kids were open
and friendly.
Really?
Yeah. It was inspiring.
You were so right to send us.
Good. Good.
I knew if you saw the campus,
you'd have a change of heart.
Me? Nah.
I'm still going to Europe.
What was that? I thought
you said the tour was fantastic.
Okay, so Preston still needs
a little convincing.
But I don't.
I'm going back to school.
Wh-what's that now?
Okay. I know it's a little
out of left field,
but walking across the quad,
I felt so alive.
I spoke with someone
in admissions,
and all I have to do
is pass an entrance exam.
So...
Ahem. You would be
a college student... again.
Mm-hmm.
25 years after the first time.
But this time--focused.
This time, knowing exactly
what I wanna major in.
Which is?
Chinese.
Chinese?
Chinese?
As in "moo goo gai pan"
Chinese?
What's he gonna do
with that,
watch Bruce Lee movies
without the subtitles?
We didn't get that far.
I felt faint, and he left
to go buy a backpack.
Ooh. Lynette, that's bad.
Well, it's just so random,
and the worst part is
if I point that out,
I'm a bitch.
Why is that?
When did being practical
and realistic
become synonymous
with bitchiness?
The first time
a man did something stupid,
and a woman pointed it out.
I know Tom. He's going to learn
how to count to ten in Chinese,
then he'll get bored
and move on to his new dream
of becoming a beekeeper.
Well, then you have no choice.
Bite the bullet and bitch.
No, she has a choice.
It's entirely possible
to get what you want
without being perceived of
as a nagging shrew.
Please, Sensei, instruct me
in your ancient ways.
Well, the key is to not let them
know what you're doing.
This requires observation,
cunning and manipulation.
Isn't it just easier
to shut down your hoo-ha
until he gives in?
I think that Bree is right--
that the more Tom sees you
digging in your heels,
the more he's gonna
wanna do it.
So you wait
for an opportunity
that you can use
to your advantage
while at the same time
appearing supportive.
That's your advice?
Hope an opportunity
just drops in my lap?
Might as well start shopping
for beekeeper suits.
Oh, you guys, I'm sorry.
I gotta run.
Hey.
I need to talk to Mike.
Oh, he's in the shower,
but I'll tell him you stopped by.
Oh, no need. I'll wait.
Orson, I'm home.
Have a seat.
So there never was
a robbery.
You took these things,
hoping to hide them from me.
And though I've tried to come up
with a reason, I can't.
So I'm forced to ask
the question why.
Why would you do
such a thing?
I want a divorce.
I'm sorry.
I don't understand.
My lawyer says you're entitled
to half of everything
we've acquired
during the marriage,
so I was trying to hide
some of those things,
since--let's face it--
I paid for them.
You've already hired
a lawyer?
Yes, but I'm tired
of all the lying
and the sneaking around,
so I will inform him
that you can have whatever you like.
I don't want a divorce.
Well, that part's
non-negotiable.
Can't we at least
talk about this?
There's no point.
So you should get a piece
of paper, start to make a list
of what it is you wish
to take with you.
So... you don't want
any of it?
No. All I want is out.
You know, he might be a while.
Sure I can't help you?
No, I need
to talk to Mike.
Now you could flush the toilet
and try to get him out of there.
You seem upset.
Something happened?
Did Mike turn Jackson in
to immigration?
No. Why would he do that?
I don't know. Jealousy?
Jackson thinks Mike
is still hung up on me.
Trust me, Susan.
Mike did not turn Jackson in.
Mm. Shower's off.
I guess we'll know
in a few seconds.
Listen... Mike couldn't have
called immigration
because I never told him
that Jackson was marrying you
for a green card.
Well, somebody did,
because he sent me a text
agreeing to keep paying me
alimony.
That was me.
I sent it.
Are you insane?
Why would you do something--
Mike has
asked me to marry him.
What?
And I was afraid
that if he found out
that you weren't really
in love with Jackson,
that he might
change his mind about me.
Okay, Katherine,
that is...
it's totally unfair to Mike.
I mean, he needs to know
the truth.
I can make him happy,
Susan.
He just needs
to get over you.
Katherine?
Please, don't ruin this.
Hey, you wanna just order in?
Oh, hey, Susan.
Um...
I'm glad you're here.
Um, I have something
I wanna tell you.
Um, yeah. I...
Katherine already told me
about your big news.
Oh.
Okay. Um...
Well, I hope we have
your blessing.
Yes, sure.
Uh...
Why not?
I'm sorry, Susan.
I was gonna tell you
myself.
Well, don't be mad
at Katherine.
We all know that she just
can't... keep a secret.
Yeah, Aunt Connie's salons
haven't been doing so well.
You know, maybe you should
take off some of those diamonds.
You walk in there like that,
you're gonna make her
feel bad about herself.
Say no more.
You know, Aunt Connie's like
a second mother to me.
Why do you hate her so much?
Because all she ever
does is put me down.
If you'd pay attention, you'd
see what I'm talking about.
Oh! There's my Carlos!
Hi, Ta.
Hi!
Mmm.
Are these the girls?
No! They're so grown up!
And, Gaby...
Is it just me,
or do you get more beautiful
every time I see you?
No, it's not just you.
Come here. Give me a hug.
Let me see your palms.
Gaby.
Fine.
Oh!
Oh! Oh!
Now come on in!
The whole family's here.
And I've made some
of my world-famous tamales.
Aunt Connie seems nice.
Maybe she's changed.
Trash don't change, sweetheart.
She's up to something.
Now come on,
let's go grab a lawn chair
before we get stuck
on the grass with the fire ants.
 Tom Scavo, this is Mr. Cummings.
We met during
your tour of the campus.
Forgive me,
but I gave you the wrong date
for the admissions test.
It's tomorrow at 8:00 A.M.
So get a good night's sleep,
and we'll see you first thing in the morning.
Help! Help! Help! Help!
Oh! Coming. I'm coming.
It goes... there.
So... I was thinking this whole
going back to school thing..
deserves
a little celebration.
Really? I didn't think
you were on board.
I wanna be supportive.
Let's go for a nice dinner,
get a bottle of wine...
maybe two, since we don't have
to wake up early tomorrow.
Or we can go
to that Mexican place
that has
those great margaritas.
Oh, Tom. You and tequila?
What a great idea.
Okay, everybody,
I need you to gather around.
Aunt Connie
has something to say.
Gaby, come on.
My Ta's waiting.
Well, let her wait.
I need something to drink.
I mean trying to keep down one
of her "world-famous" tamales.
Thank you all so much
for coming today.
It's been so long
since we've been together.
We love you, Aunt Connie.
Oh, and I love all of you.
There's nothing
more important than family.
And now I have
an announcement to make.
As many of you know,
I've battled a weak heart
for most of my life.
And the doctor now tells me
that I may only have
a few months left.
Sorry.
Bad heart.
Floor's all yours.
As some of you know,
I've been taking care
of my granddaughter,
my beautiful Ana.
Because of my condition,
I can't do it anymore,
and I need someone
to take her in.
I realize that this is
a lot to ask.
We would love to help out,
but Miguel just lost his job.
We're barely scraping by.
I understand.
Obviously, it has to be someone
who can afford to do this.
We wish we could,
but we've got such a full house.
Maybe it should be someone
who doesn't have kids.
I know this is not gonna
be easy, but we're family,
and this is what we do
for each other.
Well, you know...
we're still gonna
be family tomorrow,
so I think we should
think about it overnight
and search our hearts,
and try to figure out
which one of your homes
is best for Ana.
Gabrielle's right.
And please know that I won't
judge any of you harshly
if you decide
that you cannot take care
of my beautiful granddaughter.
We love you, Aunt Connie!
Yay!
What are you doing?
I'm helping.
I don't need any help.
And besides, my Parisian salad
doesn't call for any chives.
Yes. I've always thought
it was a bit bland.
I think the chives will give it
the bite it's so sorely lacking.
My salad has plenty of bite.
So... when are you
moving out?
Actually, I'm not.
Excuse me?
Oh, I've decided to stay
so we can work on our marriage.
Am I cutting these too fine?
Orson, I understand
this is a shock,
but you have to face facts.
Our marriage is over.
Ah, once you weigh
what's at stake,
I think you'll change
your mind.
Well, if you're referring
to the financial settlement,
I already told you,
I don't care anymore.
No, actually,
I'm referring to your freedom.
I've been to jail, Bree.
Trust me, you wouldn't last
ten seconds.
Jail?
Yes, of course.
Well, insurance fraud is a serious crime.
Ah, but I never filed an insurance claim.
Ah, but I did.
What?!
Yes, I thought we were robbed.
So, of course,
I did the responsible thing
and reported it...
on both our behalves.
And since you
rather carelessly
rented the storage unit
under your own name,
I think the police will find me
completely blameless.
You would actually
send your wife to prison?
My wife? No.
My ex-wife? You bet.
But it won't come to that,
darling.
I know we can get back
to what we both once had.
That will never happen.
And sure we've had
our challenges--
Your penchant for emasculation,
my kleptomania.
But every marriage
has its ebb and flow.
Orson, please don't do this.
I don't love you.
That's all right, darling.
I have enough love
for the both of us.
Mmm! Not bland anymore.
The girls are sacked out.
Can we talk now?
What's there to talk about?
You won't even let the girls
get a golden retriever,
And now you wanna take in a teenager?
It's not about what I want.
It's about
doing the right thing.
This is what family does for each other.
Well, luckily, it's a big family.
Let her go live with Nina and Luis.
They have eight kids.
So what's one more?
They'll never know the difference.
You're being selfish.
No, I'm thinking about our
children. They're so happy.
Taking in a kid we don't
even know? That's a huge risk.
Yeah, it's the same risk
my Aunt Connie took
for me and my mother.
When my father left, Mam and I
had nowhere else to turn.
Aunt Connie
opened her home to us.
She saved us from the streets.
Yeah, and knowing Aunt Connie,
She's waited all these years
to call that favor in.
She's probably dying
on purpose.
Babe, we are so blessed.
This is a chance
for us to give back.
Maybe God gave me back my sight
and all this money
so I could help my family.
Gaby, think about it.
If something happened to us,
wouldn't you want someone
to do this for our two girls?
Okay, whoa, whoa, easy.
You're a little drunk there.
That's 'cause I love you,
Lynette!
I love you, too, baby.
Here you go.
And I love you, Preston.
I'm Porter.
I could never tell
you two apart.
But you're my favorite.
Lynette!
How come you let me drink
so many margaritas?
Yeah, and why did we have
to stay till closing?
It's almost 2:00.
Who cares what time it is?
We were celebrating a big change
in your dad's life.
Whoo-hoo!
Hoo! Hey, someone called.
 Tom Scavo,
this is Mr. Cummings.
We met during
your tour of the campus.
Forgive me,
but I gave you the wrong date
for the admissions test.
It's tomorrow at 8:00 A.M.
Oh, cram!
I gotta crap for that test!
Ooh, jeez.
They're on to you.
Those messages you sent
to my receptionist
didn't fool anybody.
They've identified my body,
and now they're trying
to trap you.
It's not gonna work.
They can trace
those signals, Dave.
They're going to find you.
It's too late.
Whatever plan you had,
it went to hell
when you killed me.
You should've
stayed on your meds.
Y-you don't know
what you're talking about.
I'm getting away with this.
Why would you want to?
I don't mean to criticize,
but I thought you were
doing this for us.
I am.
I want justice
for our family.
Then who cares
if you're caught?
We miss you, Dave.
We should be together.
So...
What are you saying?
So I should just...
walk over and kill M.J. now?
Sure. Why not?
And let's face it, your plan
to take the kid to some lake
and pretend
he accidentally drowned?
Boring.
Hey,
isn't it better than Susan know
why her son had to die?
I mean, the whole point
is to make her suffer.
Right?
That's true.
And then the whole world
will finally understand
what you've been
going through.
Yeah, that's it!
Good job.
One more just like that.
Ooh. Hey.
Um, can I talk to you a sec?
Yeah. Sure.
I'm gonna get some juice.
You want anything?
Um, no, thanks.
So, look, uh...
I'm sorry if I was
a little under-enthusiastic
the other day
about you and Katherine
getting married.
Oh, well, I understand.
You just found out
your fianc was being deported.
The timing kind of sucked.
Yeah. That and, uh...
I don't know. It d-did kind of
come out of nowhere.
Well, we have been
living together.
I know.
But still... I mean,
it happened so fast.
I just...
I wanna make sure
that you know what you're doing.
Susan...
I know. And feel free
to throw me out of your house
if I'm out of line...
but do you love her?
Why would you ask that?
Just answer the question.
Yeah.
I love her.
Good.
That's all I needed to hear.
Well, I hope that you will
be very happy together.
And I hope everything works out
for you and Jackson.
Yeah, well, I don't know
if that's gonna happen.
What do you mean?
You two aren't getting married?
Oh, the truth is, um...
well, it's complicated.
Hey, Susan!
M.J. told me you were here.
What are you guys talking about?
We were talking about you,
actually.
Me?
What about me?
Well...
I realized that I never
properly congratulated you
on getting married.
Really?
Really.
Hey, babe.
How'd the test go?
It's as though...
I dug down deep
and I found
a new level of suck
that I never knew
I had in me.
I'm sure
it wasn't that bad.
Lynette...
I puked tequila
in the parking lot,
I-I passed out twice
in the essay section,
and I giggled uncontrollably
when I read the word "Uranus."
Add to that that I'm pretty sure
that I spelled "Scavo" wrong,
and it is a safe bet
that I will not be
broadening my horizons
anytime soon.
Hey.
Don't sweat it.
You wanted to learn Chinese...
Mm, we'll get you a book.
Mandarin is a very complicated language.
You can't get the kind
of fluency you need
for the professional marketplace
from a book.
Marketplace?
That's the whole point.
China is one of the world's
fastest growing economies.
The opportunities for someone
with my marketing experience
Who can speak the language
are amazing.
I mean, we're talking
beaucoup bucks.
I could've
totally reinvented myself.
That's...
a brilliant plan.
Why didn't you
tell me this?
What does  matter?
It's over.
I'm sorry I let you down.
Wow.
You're getting married
this weekend?
Yeah. That's the good thing
about Vegas.
Doesn't require any planning.
Oh, my gosh.
You know what?
Why don't you come with us?
You could be
my Maid of Honor.
That's ridiculous,
isn't it?
It's sweet, but...
Yeah, it's ridiculous.
And besides, um,
M.J. and I have big plans
this weekend.
Hey, Dave.
Glad I caught you.
Is your friend's boat
still available this weekend?
What?
Well, I was thinking about what
you said, and you were right.
It really would do me good to
get out of here for a few days.
You're right.
It would do us all some good.
Carlos!
You have no idea
how much this means to me,
knowing that you and Gaby
will be looking after
my beautiful Ana.
I can finally be at peace.
Ohh.
I love you, too.
And tell Gaby
I said thank you.
Bye.
So... are you gonna tell him
the truth about Ana?
Oh, they'll find out
soon enough.
Hello?
Hi. I'm trying
to reach Roberta Simmonds.
Speaking, but barely.
Who's this?
This is Claire Cormier,
Dr. Heller's receptionist.
Do you remember me?
Yeah, sure
but I'm right in the middle
of my breakfast,
so if you'd call me back around 11:00...
I just thought you might wanna know
the police stopped by.
They told me
that Dr. Heller is dead.
Yeah, go on. I'm listening.
Dr. Heller died in a fire
at the White Horse?
And apparently, there was
no smoke in his lungs.
Which means he was dead
before the fire started.
My guess?
The person he was coming to see
is the person who killed him.
Dave.
Dave.
Roberta, what are we gonna do?
Go to the police.
And tell 'em what?
Well, we know Dr. Heller
was a criminal psychologist,
And we're pretty sure
Dave was his patient.
I'd feel better
if we had proof.
I'd feel better if I had
a functioning liver,
but sometimes you have to play
the hand you're dealt.
If we walk into the police
with a half-cocked story,
they're gonna laugh us
out of the station.
I don't know how,
but we--we gotta give 'em
something more.
Didn't you tell me Dave
once broke into your house?
Yeah. Why?
Maybe it's time
we returned the favor.
You know, when you missed
your appointment on Monday,
we thought maybe
you skipped out on us.
Yeah, well, as you can see,
I was otherwise detained.
You know this guy?
No.
Who is he?
Samuel Heller--the John Doe
who died in the club fire.
You sure you didn't see him when
you were in that back hallway?
No.
Well,
like I told you that night,
I was only back there
for a minute.
And you didn't see anybody?
Aw, jeez,
it was a long time ago.
No. I was looking
for the men's room.
I ran into Dave Williams.
He was coming out
of the storage room--
Wait. You saw Dave Williams
coming out of the storage room?
Yeah.
Didn't I tell you that
before?
I thought it was
the bathroom,
but Dave pointed me
in the right direction.
And right after that,
somebody locked you in.
Come on. You don't think
Dave did that.
I don't know.
He have any reason to harm you?
No.
We're friends.
He's one of the nicest guys
I've ever met.
Well, thank you for your time,
Mr. Braddock.
I'm sorry I couldn't
be more help.
How many times we talk to this Williams guy?
Oh, I don't know. Four?
He ever mention anything about
being in that storage room?
He did not.
And I'm gonna catch a fish
this big.
Well, if you do,
we're gonna clean it
and serve it up for dinner.
And if I don't, can we eat the worms?
Just make sure he catches a fish.
Hey, Mike,
I got something for you.
It's a video from our band,
one of our early rehearsals.
Man, do I even want
to see this?
Yeah. We weren't half bad.
Don't watch it till you get back
from your honeymoon. Okay?
Will do. Thanks.
Okay.
Bye, Mike.
Have a nice wedding.
Thanks.
You take good care of my boy,
okay?
You can count on me.

The first thing Lila Dash thought about
that fateful morning was her husband Dave.
It occurred to her she should buy him a new tie.
She thought of her husband again that afternoon...
And decided she would make him something special for dinner.
That evening, Lila once again thought about her husband...
And she asked herself what she had done
to deserve someone
so wonderful.
Hey, you. What are you thinking about?
Nothin'.
So what do you say we all go out for ice cream?
Oh, I'd love to, but I brought work home.
Again?
I know. I'm so boring.
Hey, why don't you two go?
No. We'll all go tomorrow.
Now how can you make this face wait a whole day for ice cream?
Look sad.
Yeah. Oh!
Oh, fine.
I'll take her now.
Come on, sweetie.
Hey, how about tomorrow night,
I'll leave my briefcase at the office,
and we do something special, just the three of us?
It's a date.
But there would be no tomorrows for Lila and Paige Dash...
Because that was the night they crashed...
Into Susan and Mike Delfino.
The last thing Lila Dash thought about before she died
was her husband Dave.
She wondered what her death would do to him.
Luckily for Lila,
she would never know.
There was a wedding recently
at Fairview presbyterian church.
The minister spoke about the nature of marriage
and then said what all ministers say
to conclude such matters.
You may now kiss the bride.
It was then the church bells began to ring,
telling brides-to-be everywhere
their turn was next.
Hello, groom.
Guess what?
I called the hotel to tell them we were getting married.
They promised to upgrade us to a suite
and have champagne on ice.
Isn't that terrific?   Yeah. Yeah, that's great.
Wo I hope you can muster up a little more enthusiasm
for the "I dos."
I'm sorry. I'm just thinking about Susan and M.J.
Why?
Well, when they left, I just got a weird vibe from Dave.
Dave always gives off a weird vibe. That's just Dave.
No, I think I should call them.
Or maybe you should get our bags in the car
so we don't miss our flight? Because if we miss our flight,
we're going to miss our wedding day,
and if we miss our wedding day,
we're gonna miss our wedding night.
Yeah, you're right.
I'm probably worried about nothing. I'll load the car.
Uh, we need to stop at the store.
I have to get videotape for the camera. Oh, I got some old ones in the desk.
Just grab one. We'll record over it.
She's two blocks away. She'll be here any second.
Great.
Are you nervous?
Why would I be nervous?
Well, you're about to have a teenager in the house.
Well, I didn't say I wasn't sedated.
Yeah, I'm a little freaked out, too.
But we're doing the right thing.
Yeah, when I think about everything
that little girl's been through...
Her dad walked out, her mother's in jail,
the way she bounced from relative to relative...
I just want this to be the end of the line for her.   Me, too.
Mommy, here comes the taxi!
I wonder if she'll even remember me.
Oh, I doubt it. You haven't seen her since she was 6.
Yeah, and when she was little, I used to spend a lot of time
with her and her dad before he left.
I remember taking her on the swings at the park.
I remember buying her ice cream.
I remember giving her piggyback rides.   Ohh.
I don't remember that.
You told him about the divorce?   I had to. He found the storage unit.
He wanted an explanation.
I was in such a state of shock,
I couldn't think of anything else to say.
Bree, this isn't good.   You have no idea.
Now he's saying if I try to divorce him,
he can go to the police and report me.
Report you? For what?   Filing a false insurance claim.
He's the one who filed it,
but he's gonna say that I told him to.
Oh, crap.   I told him I don't love him. He said he doesn't care.
He wants us to work on our marriage.
Oh, wow. Well, clearly, the guy's a little crazy.
A little? The man put chives in my parisian salad!
He should be in a straightjacket!
Okay, calm down. This isn't the end of the world.
Isn't it?
I'm being blackmailed by a man I'm starting to despise,
and if I don't pretend to love him,
he can have me arrested.
Bree...
I don't want you to worry about this.
We're gonna think of something.
What can we think of? He's holding all the cards.
Trust me. None ever holds all the cards.
Lynette, get down here!
What's going on?   I just got off the phone with the university.
Mm-hmm?   I'm in!
Really?! You passed the test?!
Not only did I pass the test,
your genius husband scored in the top 5%,
Drunk out of his mind!
Oh!
Which, by the way, I am not condoning... ever.
Congrats, dad!
Thank you, baby. Mwah!
I can help you study if you want.
I'm not sure how much help you're gonna be.
I'm majoring in Chinese.
I know how to say "take me to a strip bar" in mandarin.
I'm so proud.
Porter, aren't you gonna congratulate your father?
Congratulations on ruining my life.
If you see me on campus,
You're not allowed to talk to me.
Okay, that's everyone.
This calls for hot fudge sundaes.
Everybody... In the car!
Okay. Ohh! Mwah!
You coming?   Uh, I'm gonna make a quick phone call,
and I'll be right out.   Okay.
Hi. This is Lynette Scavo.
May I please speak to Dr. Rushton?
Tell him it's important.
Hi. Dr. Rushton,
I need to come in and see you as soon as possible.
I think the cancer's back.
Mommy, can I have a juice box?
Oh, sweetie. You just had one,
and we don't want to have to stop ten times
so you can go to the bathroom.
I miss diapers.
Oh, the joys of being a parent.
Yeah, I remember.
You do?
I had a little girl.
She died.
Oh, my god. I...
I... I had no idea. I'm so sorry.
That's okay.
I'm learning to deal with it.
I can't believe Edie gave you a key.   Why not? She trusted me.
And I only used it when I was out of milk or bread...
or cash.
Okay, look for anything that could tie Dave to Dr. Heller.
Look through his files, his papers, even his trash.
Roberta, what are you doing?
We're trying to catch a murderer.   I know, but before I get to the bottom of that,
I'd like to get to the bottom of this.
Oh, look!
Oh! Muscle relaxers... score!
Put that back! They're not yours.
Yeah, apparently, they're not his either. Who's David Dash?
Mr. Williams? It's the police.
Oh!   Oh, cheese it!
We need to ask you a few questions.
Please tell me
you doesn't have anything illegal on you.   I do, but it's hidden.
And if they find it, we got a lawsuit.
Ladies?
Open up, please.
Uh, hi there.   Can I help you?
Well, I hope so. Are you Orson Hodge?
Yes, I am. You are...
You want me to let go?
You want me to let go?
Yeah.
There, I let go.
Now you gotta do the same.   I don't know what you mean.
Oh, I think you do, and I am dead serious.
If you don't let go...
Next time, neither will I.
Brought you a laundry basket.
You need me to show you how to use the washer?
It's my clever way of saying
You're gonna be doing your own laundry.
Oh. Okay.
You know, the girls have chores, too.
It's how we teach them responsibility.
Speaking of which, uh...
curfew's 10:00, 11:00 on weekends.
Does that seem reasonable?
Sure. No problem.
Hmm.
This teenager thing isn't so bad.
So what are my other chores?
Oh, well, not to push my luck,
But I was thinking you could sweep the front porch
and take care of the guest bathroom.
You got it.
Oh, that's a pretty dress.
Oh, my god, it's Versace!
Yeah. It's all right.
"all right"? Young lady, if you live under my roof,
You will not disparage Versace.
Sorry.
No, I'm just kidding. It was a joke.
Oh. Funny.
Well, I guess I'm gonna get started on my laundry.
Vera Wang!
Where are you getting all these dresses?
They were gifts.
You know, from boyfriends.
Boyfriends? How many do you have?
Not as many as I used to. I had to make some cutbacks.
Yeah, the economy has hit us all.
So...
What kind of boyfriends can afford things like this?
They're college guys
With rich parents who can pay for everything.
Uh... huh. And so... they give you designer clothes,
and you give them...
The pleasure of my company.
Yeah. Okay, well...
Don't take this the wrong way,
but that's not exactly from the Versace virgin line.
I don't have to do anything.
They just have to think I might.
Uh... huh, and how long do you think that will last?
Till 10:00, 11:00 on the weekends.
Just kidding. It was a joke.
Oh.
Funny.
Are you all right?
What happened to your shirt?
Why don't you ask your friend?
The one you hired to assault me.
You were assaulted?
He, uh...
Grabbed me by the throat, threw me to the ground
And told me to "let go."
Your message came through loud and clear.
I had nothing to do with that.
Oh, please.
Who else would have done it?
I don't know.
But I swear to you, we may have our differences,
But I would never hire someone to attack you.
You have to believe me.
I do.
Forgive me.
I should've known you could never hurt me.
I'll stay.
What?
Once I've unpacked, I'll bring you my shirt so you can mend it.
We're just running to the store, ana. We'll be back in a bit.
Okay. I'll sweep the porch while you're gone.   And if you don't mind,
will you make sure Juanita and Celia do their chores, too?
Sure thing.
I got the rest, Babe.
All right, I'll see you inside.
Oh, you're back.
Oh, my god.
Ana, the house is so clean.
Just wanted to do my part.
Well, how did you get everything done so quickly?
Well...
We finished upstairs, Ana. Anything else you need done?
They wanted to hang out, but I had chores to do,
so they insisted on helping me.
Aren't they sweet?
Hey, um, I'm not bragging and I don't recommend it,
But you could so eat out of your downstairs toilet.
Okay, boys, thanks for your hard work,
But maybe it's time to go home and take a shower...
Preferably a cold one.
Bye, Preston.
I'm Porter.   I'm Preston.
Oh, you can call me whatever you want.   All right.
Mommy, it was so cool.
Ana got the boys to do my chores, too.
Did she?
I wanna learn how to make boys do stuff. Can you teach me?
Uh, okay, Juanita, go to your room.
And don't come out until you're 18.
Is something wrong?
Ana, the whole point of chores is that you do them.
You don't bat your eyes and call rent-a-horny-kid.
The house is clean. Why do you care how it got that way?
I care about the message it sends to my little girls,
and I'm starting to care a little bit about your tone.   Oh, I'm sorry.
How do you like your housekeepers to speak to you?
And the teenager has finally arrived.
Ana, listen.
We want you to be part of this family.
We will love you and support you and take care of you,
but in exchange,
You will show us a little bit of respect and obey our rules,
which means doing your own chores,
no boys in the house and no more gifts from men.
I get it now.
You're jealous.
Of what?
Of me.
You're not young anymore.
You can't get guys to do things for you,
and that drives you crazy.
You wanna see crazy?
Make one more statement like that,
and I am throwing your ass out on the street.
You care to test me?
Ana? What's wrong?
I don't know what I did. She wants to kick me out.
So she had a couple boys come over and do her chores.
You've been doing stuff like that your whole life.
That's not the point! You didn't hear the way she talked to me!   I don't care!
You don't tell a kid who's been bounced around her whole life
that you're gonna throw her out on the street!   I didn't tell her that!
I just... Kind of threatened to.
Bottom line... she is my niece, and she is not going anywhere.
You're the adult, Gaby. Start acting like it.
I know this looks bad,
but we did what we did for a good reason.
Ma'am, you can't break into a person's house for any reason.
Uh, what if there's a baby inside and there's a fire?
Well...
See? Everything's not all cut and dry, is it, rookie?
Roberta, don't piss him off.
You can't take a club to the head like you used to.
Okay, I just got off the phone with Heller's secretary.
David Dash was definitely a patient there.
Well, that's why we couldn't make the match.   Mm-hmm.
He changed his last name. And get this.   Mm-hmm.
He's the same guy whose wife and daughter
were killed in that car crash up on Canterbury road.   Canterbury road!
I remember that accident.
My neighbors Mike and Susan were in the car that hit 'em.
Oh, wait. Now wait. Okay, that's quite weird.
I mean, why would Dave move onto the same street
as the people who killed his family?
The doctor has your results. He'll be here in a minute.
Do you know what they are?
You'll need to talk to the doctor about that.
Come on. I know you know. It's cancer again. Am I right?
I honestly don't know.
Now please, he'll just be a moment.
If it's cancer, and I find out you knew,
I won't be dying alone.
Hello, Lynette.
Hi.
Well, I'm glad you came in. We got the results back,
and the test did pick something up.
So it is the cancer.
Oh, god, I can't go through this again!
No, no, no. It's nothing like that.
You're pregnant.
Excuse me?
About six weeks or so.
Are you sure it's not cancer?
Okay, Susan.
But when you're out on the boat, make sure you put on sunscreen.
And on your feet, too. Remember our trip to Mexico?
Okay, I'll talk to you guys later.
Everything's fine.
I don't know what I was worried about.
Are you sure you wanna do this?
Do what?
Go to Vegas, get married.
I mean, it is a whole weekend away from Susan.
Katherine, I told you.
I just wanted to make sure M.J. was okay.   Why don't you just admit it?
You're still hung up on her.   Oh, for god sake, are we gonna do this again?
All I know is, it's our wedding day,
and you were in a crappy mood
until you talked to your ex-wife.
Katherine, I wouldn't be sitting here
if I didn't want to marry you. Okay?
Really?
Do I need to shout it out in the airport?
You wouldn't do that.   Oh, I will.
I'll... I'll do whatever I need to, to prove my love!   No, it's okay!
You convinced me.
I am dying for a cappuccino. You want one?
Yeah, I do.
You said it. "I do."
Can't take it back now.
... should be allowed to just... Walk away.
I know some people will wonder,
why didn't I just kill Susan?
But what good would that have done?
She'd be dead. There'd be no... suffering.
And to those of you who hate me
Because I took the life of an innocent, young boy,
I say...
Katherine!
Excuse me.
That woman I was with? Tell her I had to go. It's an emergency.
Oh, uh, your friend asked me to tell you he had to leave.
What?
He said to say he's sorry.
What were you thinking?   First, tell me if it worked,
then I'll tell you what I was thinking.
Don't be glib. Did you hire someone to attack Orson?
Yes.
Are you insane? Your thug tried to strangle him.
If he had tried to strangle him, he'd be dead.
Look, Orson had the upper hand in this divorce.
We needed to regain it.   Not by resorting to physical violence.
I would never have given my permission for that.   That's why I didn't ask you.
W... what's your beef here, Bree?
My beef is that from the minute I walked into this office,
You have pulled me deeper and deeper
Into your moral cesspool. That is not why I hired you.
Please. That is exactly why you hired me.
Face it. You were tired of being a good girl.
You knew it was time to play dirty.
I wanted to protect what was mine.
You have turned me into someone I don't recognize.
And you've loved every minute of it.
No, I haven't.   Yes, you have!
And so have I.
Because the truth is,
I think you're the most fascinating woman
That I have ever met.
What?
Karl...
If I have not been clear about how I feel about you,
I apologize for any ambiguity.
Understand this... I detest you.
No, you don't. I can see it in your eyes.
You want me to walk over there and pull you up against me
And kiss you until your knees buckle.
You're fired.
Good. That keeps this from being a breach of ethics.
My knees haven't buckled yet.
# She swallowed the spider to catch the fly #
# I don't know why she swa... #
Oh, it's your daddy. Hey, Mike.
Hey! Hey, where are you? Are you with Dave?
Uh, yeah. We are in the car, singing.
All right, Susan, listen to me. Do not react
To what I'm about to tell you.   Wow.
This sounds really...   Susan! Do you understand me?
Okay.
Dave's real name is David Dash.
He's the husband of the woman we killed in the accident.   Oh, my god.
Don't react!
Uh... Problem?
Uh... That sucks.
How could they cancel your flight?   All right, you guys are in danger.
Just get away from him. Go to a gas station, a store...
Anyplace there's people. I'm on my way.
Right.
So how long do you think you'll be delayed?
Uh, I'm a half-hour from the lake.
I'm calling the cops right now. Just get away from him.
Get out of that car and get away from Dave.
And you call me the second you do.   Okay.
Um... Well, I hope you get there soon.
Bumped his flight?
Yeah.   Oh, what a drag.
Mm. Okay, from the top.
# There was an old lady who swallowed a fly #
# I don't know why she swallowed the fly #
# Perhaps she'll die #
Gosh, it feels like we've been driving forever.
Maybe we should stretch our legs.
Ah, we're almost there. Let's keep going.
Aren't you hungry, though?
Maybe there's a restaurant up ahead.
I really don't want to stop, Susan.
Okay.
It's no big deal.
Hon!
Look what I got for college. I got pens. I got notebooks.
Ooh, I got an English to Mandarin dictionary
'Cause you never know
when you might need a...
Oh, and look at this.
Check it out.
They're scented. You wanna smell grape?
What? They're...
Like candy.
I went to the doctor today.
What's wrong?
I'm pregnant.
Pregnant?
With a baby?
How long have you been sniffing those markers?
Of course with a baby.
But you can't. I mean... W... we can't.
W... we're old!
Well, apparently, not old engh.
What am I gonna do about school?
What am I gonna do about my job?
We're gonna have another baby.
Actually, I have an addendum to that.
Please tell me you're about to recite the girl scout oath.
No, Tom.
We're having twins...
Again.
I have to go potty.
Okay, sweetie.
Do you mind pulling over at the next rest stop?
We're almost there, buddy. Can you hold it?   No. I really have to go.
Fine.
Just hold on a few more minutes.
Oh. Um...
Here?
He... he can't go here.
Come on, M.J. Let's go.
Um, can't we find a gas station or maybe a diner?
He's a big boy. He can use the bushes.
Okay. Here, M.J. Wait for me.   Don't go too far.
Hello?
Dave, detective Collins with the Fairview P.D.
We know everything.
I... I'm sorry. What are you...   Heller, your wife, your child. All of it.
If you come in now, I'll do everything I can to help you.
But let's end this before someone gets hurt.
Keys.
Keys... Oh.
Aah!
Aah! M.J., run!
Come on, honey! Let's run! Let's run!
Why are we running?
We're playing a game with Dave, okay?
So run as fast as you can.
Are you okay?
Aah! Ow! I'm fine.
Susan! M.J.!
Okay, listen.
It's really important that you win this game.
So I want you to find a good hiding place,
And even if you hear Dave,
You don't come out no matter what, okay? Okay?
Don't worry. I'm gonna hide, too. Now go.
Go!
Where is he?
You are not gonna mess this up!
Aah! Aah!   We are too close to the finish line!
Now call him!
Call him.
M.J.!
Don't come out!
M.J.!
You wanna go fishing, don't you, buddy?
Well, if you don't come out now, we're gonna get there too late!
I'll let you drive the boat!
Okay, if you don't come out right now,
We're gonna leave without you.
You don't wanna be in this scary graveyard after dark, do ya?
All right, M.J.,
We're leaving!
Mommy, wake up. I get to drive the boat.
Now keep the volume really high.
You don't wanna hear all the boring grown-up talk.
Buckle up.
What are you gonna do to us?
Shut up. I'm trying to think.
Dave, please...
I'm so sorry about that accident.
You don't wanna hurt M.J. or me.
You're a good person. I know you.   Don't analyze me.
The last guy who tried that didn't do so well.
Well, you won't get away with it.
Mike already called the cops. They're on their way.   Enough!
Susan? Where are you?
Not up at the lake.
You kind of screwed up my plans here, Mike.   Mike!
Oh, and, uh, Susan says hello.
Okay, Dave, take it easy.
You aren't revenge?
Let Susan and M.J. go. Take me instead.
How does it feel, Mike,
to know that you can't save the people that you love?
Hopeless?
Like your entire life has no meaning?
Dave, please.
I... I can't be that far behind you. I'm on route 12.
You're on route 12?
Yeah. Yeah, come on.
You don't wanna hurt them. Let me be the one.
You're right. You should be the one.
So we've got a deal?
If I see one cop car, they're both dead.
No cops. You just tell me where to meet you.
Keep heading south.
There's an abandoned gas station
Past the intersection of route 12 and Canterbury road.
Canterbury road? That's where we...
Yeah, it is.
Look familiar?
What are you gonna do to us?
Why did you bring us here?
I thought it would be poetic.
Mike should be here any minute.
Dave, please. Don't hurt Mike.
It wasn't his fault.
No. It was your fault.
But he wants to be the hero, so...
Get out.
I'm not leaving M.J.
M.J.'s coming. I need send you up first. Get out.
Now.
Try not to scare M.J. when you bring him here.
Actually, change of plans.
What?
M.J.'s staying with me.
He and I are gonna pull into that intersection
Just as Mike comes barreling down that road.
Oh, my God.
And you're gonna stay there and watch
as Mike kills your child,
just like you killed mine.
I told you it was poetic.
Dave, please. Please.
I cannot imagine the pain you went through,
But you can't do this. You can't kill my little boy!
Shut up.
What if your daughter could see you now!
Is this how you'd want her to see you?!
As a monster who could murder an innocent child?!
I'm not a monster.
Dave! Dave!
You don't need that.
You're a big boy now.
Aah!
Aah!
Mike!
Mike! Mike!
Stop!
No!
M.J.!
M.J.!
Mama!
Oh, God! Are you okay?
Dave told me to get out of the car.
Oh!
Mike.
Mike!
Daddy!
So what do you say we all go out for ice cream?
Oh, I'd love to, but I brought work home.
Again?
I know. I'm so boring.
Hey, why don't you two go?
Oh, fine. I'll take her now.
Come on, sweetie.
Wait.
Don't go.
We have marshmallows and chocolate.
I can make s'mores.
Would you like that, my little princess?
Yeah!
Yeah.
You sure?
You said you had work.
It can wait.
I always have time for my girls.
I always have time for my girls.
There was a wedding recently
at Fairview presbyterian church.
The Minister spoke about the nature of marriage...
The sublime joy of giving birth...
The immense pleasure of raising a family...
The importance of fidelity...
and then he said what all ministers say
To conclude such matters...
You may now kiss the bride.
For a moment,
The groom wondered if he was doing the right thing.
That's when the bells began to ring,
Telling him he had.
